130.56 --> 135.28
it's hot

132.319 --> 135.28
very very hot

138.239 --> 144.72
and yeah some fluffy clouds

142.56 --> 147.52
beautiful clear sky though

144.72 --> 150.239
in between that

147.52 --> 154.0
there's a bit of a breeze constantly but

150.239 --> 154.0
yeah it is still very hot

154.4 --> 161.59900000000002
especially right here right now when

158.16 --> 162.959
sun is still hitting the wall somewhat

161.599 --> 165.35999999999999
that should be

162.959 --> 168.31900000000002
a lot better

165.36 --> 171.31900000000002
like half an hour i think

168.319 --> 171.319
ah

172.879 --> 177.2
hello psycbear first in chat good to see

175.44 --> 182.84
you

177.2 --> 182.83999999999997
it is saturday the 16th of july 2022

184.8 --> 187.20000000000002
right

187.36 --> 190.239
and yeah

190.72 --> 194.48
i decided to

192.72 --> 197.959
to

194.48 --> 197.959
get on twitter

198.319 --> 204.0
so i did that i'm going to use it mostly

200.56 --> 205.84
to kind of share letter debate yeah

204.0 --> 208.08
the early bird show

205.84 --> 211.519
and connect up but i'm yeah i'm also

208.08 --> 212.799
like i'm engaging just blabbering

211.519 --> 216.08
so

212.799 --> 216.08
that's what you do on twitter

216.64 --> 220.159
and yeah wonder how long it's gonna take

218.72 --> 222.72
before they

220.159 --> 225.12
do something

222.72 --> 226.799
against it or maybe not maybe it is much

225.12 --> 228.4
freer than

226.799 --> 230.56
to me

228.4 --> 234.159
than i thought it was gonna be

230.56 --> 236.239
it's only one way to find out

234.159 --> 237.28
so yeah

236.239 --> 239.59900000000002
if you

237.28 --> 241.15
like twitter follow twitter then yeah

239.599 --> 242.959
follow me on twitter

241.15 --> 245.04
[Music]

250.0 --> 254.28

279.12 --> 283.84000000000003
of course the flat earth the [ __ ]

280.4 --> 283.84
yesterday was pretty good

286.32 --> 291.44
i was not super active on it though

289.44 --> 292.71999999999997

[Music]

311.199 --> 314.68
that's pretty cool

325.52 --> 329.59999999999997
so yeah

327.12 --> 331.6
that's roughly it for my activities and

329.6 --> 332.72
that's just like playing games and all

331.6 --> 335.12
that and

332.72 --> 339.32000000000005
worrying

335.12 --> 339.32
about my financial situation

340.4 --> 343.52
but yeah

341.65 --> 344.63899999999995
[Music]

343.52 --> 347.039
i got

344.639 --> 347.039
bread

347.52 --> 353.15999999999997
because just breads not enough i also

349.6 --> 353.16
got some bouillon

354.479 --> 358.43
because

355.84 --> 361.65999999999997
i need something

358.43 --> 361.66
[Music]

363.12 --> 368.629
hello jim west

365.44 --> 368.629
[Music]

376.0 --> 378.56
right

377.6 --> 379.6
so

378.56 --> 381.6
yeah

379.6 --> 383.91900000000004
i don't know what uh

381.6 --> 386.56
jedo has been up to

383.919 --> 388.479
but uh yeah he

386.56 --> 391.479
hasn't really contacted me back or

388.479 --> 391.479
anything

404.4 --> 408.56
right

406.16 --> 411.44
also yeah the paypal did not come in

408.56 --> 414.96
just yet so i'm afraid i'm probably

411.44 --> 414.96
gonna have to sit through this

415.84 --> 421.4
weekend

417.199 --> 421.40000000000003
with like minimum food

424.24 --> 428.16
one day i'll be able to get something

433.44 --> 436.44
anyway

444.319 --> 448.96000000000004
how's your saturday is the how's the

446.639 --> 451.84000000000003
weather there is it good is it not so

448.96 --> 451.84
good

455.32 --> 458.589
[Music]

470.0 --> 472.99
right

471.759 --> 474.8
i seem a bit

472.99 --> 477.84000000000003
[Music]

474.8 --> 481.039
different or whatever

477.84 --> 481.039
then that's because of

481.84 --> 485.44
well withdrawal symptoms

488.639 --> 492.68
i have not been

494.08 --> 498.479
getting any beers or anything right so

500.0 --> 502.8
ass

501.28 --> 504.63899999999995
lovely sunny day

502.8 --> 507.199
cool

504.639 --> 510.56
what games do i play

507.199 --> 513.599
several aseth willenberg

510.56 --> 515.44
but yeah i've been playing stronghold

513.599 --> 518.159
getting into it

515.44 --> 521.0390000000001
and yeah despite a couple of like

518.159 --> 524.24
interface uh nuisances i think it's a

521.039 --> 524.24
pretty good game although

525.839 --> 530.48
having a bit of trouble just like

527.76 --> 534.64
watching freaking peasants

530.48 --> 536.8000000000001
like make cheese and bread and [ __ ]

534.64 --> 539.12
and hunting for meat and then like

536.8 --> 542.64
looking at food stocks well i'm hungry i

539.12 --> 542.64
don't really like that

545.839 --> 552.1600000000001
but it is a pretty cool game once you

548.56 --> 552.16
like figure out how it really works

554.48 --> 558.72
the music is a bit annoying though it

557.839 --> 560.48
gets

558.72 --> 563.8000000000001
a little repetitive

560.48 --> 563.8000000000001
but uh

564.8 --> 568.68
it's an interesting game

576.56 --> 580.7199999999999
right but yeah beside that i

578.88 --> 583.2
been playing like

580.72 --> 585.2
civilization five for a long time but

583.2 --> 586.1600000000001
yeah i know that game by heart so it's

585.2 --> 588.32
not

586.16 --> 588.3199999999999
it's

588.56 --> 593.5189999999999
not really all that interesting i like

591.04 --> 596.24
the music though i think i'm playing it

593.519 --> 598.08
still a lot just because of the music

596.24 --> 599.519
there's a lot of great classical music

598.08 --> 602.519
in it

599.519 --> 602.519
uh

608.399 --> 615.6
hey rob h good to see you

612.54 --> 615.5999999999999
[Music]

621.13 --> 625.279
[Music]

622.48 --> 629.36
ff you mean final fantasy do you think

625.279 --> 629.36
that has the best music really

629.519 --> 632.519
okay

638.32 --> 642.3290000000001
[Music]

644.8 --> 648.24
i'm not a really big fan

651.65 --> 654.76
[Music]

656.399 --> 659.68
to each their own

658.0 --> 663.0
especially if you grew up with that i

659.68 --> 663.0
get it

673.61 --> 679.519
[Music]

676.959 --> 683.4399999999999
right so anyway yeah if

679.519 --> 685.76
if you do anything with twitter ever

683.44 --> 688.24
then please consider

685.76 --> 690.3199999999999
following me there

688.24 --> 692.48
follow this link

690.32 --> 696.12
also the link is now standard in the

692.48 --> 696.12
description box

707.6 --> 710.6
um

720.16 --> 726.4399999999999
yay got my first like to a tweet i made

732.8 --> 735.8389999999999
so yeah that

734.32 --> 738.5600000000001
twitter is going to be kind of mixed

735.839 --> 740.72
languages for me because there is a lot

738.56 --> 743.4399999999999
of dutch twittering going on including

740.72 --> 745.44
like former protest [ __ ]

743.44 --> 747.44
so i'm gonna use it to follow that as

745.44 --> 750.9590000000001
well and talk about flat earth which

747.44 --> 752.72
i'll do in english mostly

750.959 --> 754.7199999999999
and yeah

752.72 --> 756.639
hopefully it'll get some back and forth

754.72 --> 757.76
on there

756.639 --> 760.5600000000001
because

757.76 --> 761.76
for example i challenged flat earth

760.56 --> 765.1199999999999
people

761.76 --> 765.12
hey i want to talk

765.2 --> 769.6800000000001
about the map orientation and the claim

767.76 --> 773.36
that is literally a disk because there's

769.68 --> 777.4399999999999
all these arguments about planes flying

773.36 --> 777.44
in straight lines over the disk

777.68 --> 781.92
and

779.44 --> 784.399
i don't think that's like a definitive

781.92 --> 787.279
piece of proof

784.399 --> 789.2
because i think that it probably has

787.279 --> 791.4399999999999
like if it's not a disc and i don't

789.2 --> 794.1600000000001
think it is i think it's rectangular

791.44 --> 796.5600000000001
actually or more in that direction

794.16 --> 799.4399999999999
i think that airplanes simply don't

796.56 --> 801.5189999999999
really want to fly directly over the

799.44 --> 803.2
ocean

801.519 --> 805.04
for a long distance because then if

803.2 --> 807.36
something goes wrong you're screwed and

805.04 --> 810.24
that's why they like to kind of sort of

807.36 --> 810.24
follow the coast

811.2 --> 815.279
most of the time that's why they don't

813.2 --> 820.0
directly cross the ocean because it's

815.279 --> 820.0
like too risky that's what i think

820.639 --> 826.76
okay looping earth is the only feasible

822.8 --> 826.76
reality that's

826.81 --> 832.959
[Music]

829.68 --> 834.7199999999999
i think it's an option

832.959 --> 837.199
and it is

834.72 --> 838.8000000000001
worth investigating and it is

837.199 --> 840.3199999999999
falsifiable

838.8 --> 842.16
and that's what i'm holding on to it's

840.32 --> 844.24
falsifiable

842.16 --> 847.279
if it's not the case that should

844.24 --> 848.16
absolutely be provable

847.279 --> 850.24
so

848.16 --> 852.8
but i'm

850.24 --> 854.9590000000001
i'm just my intuition was on it very

852.8 --> 856.56
early

854.959 --> 859.5189999999999
and i just think that

856.56 --> 863.199
a looping flat earth

859.519 --> 866.72
is much more realistic

863.199 --> 866.7199999999999
from a designer's perspective

868.88 --> 873.36
right and it's really the physicality

870.8 --> 876.399
assumption by us again it follows us

873.36 --> 880.32
around everywhere we go in our minds

876.399 --> 883.12
is really the only thing that obstructs

880.32 --> 885.839
a looping realm concept from being

883.12 --> 888.9590000000001
accepted

885.839 --> 890.5600000000001
but i think that architecturally wise if

888.959 --> 894.079
you like

890.56 --> 896.88
the designer of physical space itself i

894.079 --> 900.0
do not see the objection at all it's

896.88 --> 901.6
really the human mind that objects not

900.0 --> 904.0
god

901.6 --> 906.399
anyway

904.0 --> 909.6
mobius earth no

906.399 --> 913.12
literally flat every part of it flat all

909.6 --> 916.32
flat geometrically flat

913.12 --> 917.839
no mobius no concave nothing

916.32 --> 921.9200000000001
flat

917.839 --> 921.9200000000001
it's flat literally flat

923.76 --> 927.8389999999999
anyway hello raised by gypsies

931.759 --> 937.32
you must agree okay

934.0 --> 937.32
that's cool

937.82 --> 940.879
[Music]

943.199 --> 948.7199999999999
keep in mind though there is still

945.519 --> 951.759
no absolute proof for it it's just that

948.72 --> 955.0400000000001
the more time passes the less

951.759 --> 957.6800000000001
the disk model is proven

955.04 --> 959.12
and the more the options remain open to

957.68 --> 962.8389999999999
it being

959.12 --> 962.839
looping rectangular

964.02 --> 967.21
[Music]

974.24 --> 976.5600000000001
right

977.92 --> 983.04
and i don't know maybe i will never even

980.56 --> 984.88
figure it out during my lifetime maybe i

983.04 --> 987.8389999999999
think we're probably all going to be too

984.88 --> 987.8389999999999
preoccupied

988.079 --> 992.16
with like world war 3 and [ __ ]

993.92 --> 998.88
right as long as there is like a war

995.92 --> 1001.519
like that there is no exploration there

998.88 --> 1003.6
will not be exploration possible because

1001.519 --> 1006.92
the military just will not

1003.6 --> 1006.9200000000001
allow it

1010.639 --> 1013.44
what

1011.759 --> 1016.0790000000001
the dateline

1013.44 --> 1017.519
dio me these islands i don't know what

1016.079 --> 1019.04
you're talking about

1017.519 --> 1023.399
but fine

1019.04 --> 1023.399
hey mike sudanic good to see you

1036.72 --> 1040.779
hmm

1037.72 --> 1040.779
[Music]

1050.24 --> 1056.16
anyways thanks guys in chat for the

1052.32 --> 1060.0
philosophical support my ideas

1056.16 --> 1060.0
it still remains just that though

1063.28 --> 1068.24
i mean effectively all i'm doing is just

1065.76 --> 1069.44
taking it one little step back

1068.24 --> 1072.16
from

1069.44 --> 1074.3200000000002
absolutely reification of the disc earth

1072.16 --> 1076.24
like it has to be that because there is

1074.32 --> 1080.08
still a lot of flat earthers out there

1076.24 --> 1084.559
that are just holding on to no it has to

1080.08 --> 1086.8799999999999
be that it has to be a disk

1084.559 --> 1089.9189999999999
and so they full-on reified and spend

1086.88 --> 1092.0
all their time trying to

1089.919 --> 1094.7990000000002
like iron out the weird little

1092.0 --> 1096.4
inconsistencies and

1094.799 --> 1099.12
because in their mind they're just

1096.4 --> 1101.2
defending it against the globe

1099.12 --> 1103.28
so they're stuck in the false dichotomy

1101.2 --> 1105.44
because of physicality assumption bias

1103.28 --> 1105.44
and

1107.12 --> 1110.8799999999999
and just this

1108.4 --> 1113.679
false dichotomy that makes them like but

1110.88 --> 1116.88
we have to make a full-on claim all the

1113.679 --> 1118.96
globers will be ahead of us with all

1116.88 --> 1120.72
fallacies by the way but

1118.96 --> 1123.2
that is probably what is driving a lot

1120.72 --> 1124.48
of flat earthers to hold on to that disc

1123.2 --> 1126.0
so much

1124.48 --> 1128.0
instead of getting honest with

1126.0 --> 1130.24
themselves taking taking a few steps

1128.0 --> 1132.4
back and realizing like

1130.24 --> 1135.919
there's actually very little we know

1132.4 --> 1139.2
with absolute certainty about the realm

1135.919 --> 1141.6000000000001
about its orientation other than being

1139.2 --> 1141.6000000000001
flat

1142.24 --> 1148.28
and yeah

1143.679 --> 1148.2800000000002
that remains to be explored so

1154.16 --> 1158.48
oh yeah yeah you were in the globe light

1155.679 --> 1163.0800000000002
tour yeah yeah i know

1158.48 --> 1163.08
i think i saw you on the camera there

1164.32 --> 1167.32
hmm

1180.16 --> 1185.679
it's okay matthew hall yeah when jose

1182.96 --> 1188.0
stream they said flat earth is slowing

1185.679 --> 1190.3200000000002
numbers right yeah

1188.0 --> 1193.12
yeah yeah they've been saying that

1190.32 --> 1195.9189999999999
since 2015 now

1193.12 --> 1197.9189999999999
yes of course i mean

1195.919 --> 1200.24
all these flat earthers they're all gone

1197.919 --> 1203.2800000000002
now because it's just

1200.24 --> 1207.6
so much loss of numbers it's

1203.28 --> 1210.32
i mean nobody's interested anymore right

1207.6 --> 1213.039
uh nope

1210.32 --> 1216.799
no actually flat earth is now

1213.039 --> 1220.1589999999999
just everywhere flat earth is now on

1216.799 --> 1222.1589999999999
every social media platform

1220.159 --> 1224.3200000000002
every single one there is no social

1222.159 --> 1226.3200000000002
media platform that completely excludes

1224.32 --> 1229.6
flat earth at this point right

1226.32 --> 1231.84
that's how much we've grown in numbers

1229.6 --> 1235.559
that we've become a category that they

1231.84 --> 1235.559
dare not exclude

1236.24 --> 1240.72
all right like they like to put us on

1238.159 --> 1241.919
the lower shelf right they don't exclude

1240.72 --> 1244.559
it anymore

1241.919 --> 1247.44
because it is actually growing and it is

1244.559 --> 1250.3999999999999
normalizing people are starting to

1247.44 --> 1252.559
have their anti-flat earth conditioning

1250.4 --> 1253.8400000000001
based on school and media

1252.559 --> 1256.0
implants

1253.84 --> 1258.0
have it they're they're losing it

1256.0 --> 1260.84
they're losing that condition

1258.0 --> 1263.2
negative response

1260.84 --> 1266.0
so just let

1263.2 --> 1268.0800000000002
people in jose stream and others just

1266.0 --> 1270.72
blabber on eternally about how flat

1268.08 --> 1272.08
earth is dying is not new and it's not

1270.72 --> 1274.64
true

1272.08 --> 1276.559
we're growing

1274.64 --> 1279.3600000000001
right we're not growing

1276.559 --> 1281.6789999999999
mainstream media level

1279.36 --> 1284.32
because that only works when you get

1281.679 --> 1286.4
huge amounts of banker money pumped into

1284.32 --> 1289.28
you because you're actually a hostile

1286.4 --> 1291.6000000000001
agent there to attack humanity

1289.28 --> 1293.039
yeah that's why they get all those

1291.6 --> 1294.9599999999998
numbers

1293.039 --> 1297.44
we don't get the numbers

1294.96 --> 1299.8400000000001
but we got the attention and we got the

1297.44 --> 1301.919
interest people know about it

1299.84 --> 1303.039
there's like

1301.919 --> 1305.2800000000002
i think

1303.039 --> 1309.2
there is probably

1305.28 --> 1311.44
by now like a million people out there

1309.2 --> 1313.52
that know me

1311.44 --> 1316.24
that have heard of me directly

1313.52 --> 1316.24
indirectly

1317.28 --> 1321.76
and that just keep their distance

1320.32 --> 1324.0
because

1321.76 --> 1325.76
the numbers are just not an accurate

1324.0 --> 1328.08
reflection

1325.76 --> 1330.559
like they can't be

1328.08 --> 1331.28
after seven years

1330.559 --> 1333.6789999999999
and

1331.28 --> 1336.24
doing a daily stream for almost four

1333.679 --> 1339.679
years every single day

1336.24 --> 1339.679
there is no way

1339.76 --> 1345.12
that my sub count can be at this

1342.72 --> 1345.1200000000001
number

1345.28 --> 1350.1589999999999
it should be around 5000 at least but i

1348.159 --> 1352.159
don't really care that much anymore

1350.159 --> 1354.48
because what i care about most is that i

1352.159 --> 1357.5200000000002
actually spread around people get to

1354.48 --> 1359.52
know me and that i yeah well

1357.52 --> 1363.6
get plenty of support

1359.52 --> 1363.6
that's really the most important part

1365.28 --> 1372.71
because i want to eat i'm hungry

1369.57 --> 1372.71
[Music]

1382.32 --> 1385.96
way more yeah

1389.6 --> 1396.32
that's nonsense terror306 2024

1394.159 --> 1398.48
too difficult to contain the truth

1396.32 --> 1398.48
no

1398.559 --> 1403.44
we're already way past that stage and

1400.96 --> 1404.96
it's not they're not trying to contain

1403.44 --> 1408.0800000000002
the truth

1404.96 --> 1411.28
they're just trying to put it in camps

1408.08 --> 1411.28
for extermination

1411.76 --> 1416.1589999999999
right they're just going like yeah we

1414.08 --> 1419.039
know it's now popular it's getting

1416.159 --> 1420.64
popular and popular is evil so we're

1419.039 --> 1423.84
gonna attack you because you think

1420.64 --> 1426.0800000000002
things are popular that we disapprove of

1423.84 --> 1428.9599999999998
right

1426.08 --> 1431.52
so what we're seeing is not like all the

1428.96 --> 1434.24
threshold needs to come it's coming and

1431.52 --> 1437.2
oh then we're free no no it's just that

1434.24 --> 1438.4
the entire apparatus mainstream media

1437.2 --> 1441.52
politics

1438.4 --> 1442.72
have now become hostile

1441.52 --> 1445.44
towards

1442.72 --> 1448.4
the entire populace of the world they're

1445.44 --> 1450.3200000000002
now openly hostile they don't care

anymore what you believe

1450.32 --> 1454.6399999999999
they only care

1451.84 --> 1456.72
that you don't catch on

1454.64 --> 1458.64
that you're delusional

1456.72 --> 1460.64
and that it only gets worse and that you

1458.64 --> 1462.3200000000002
lose interest in reality that's what

1460.64 --> 1464.5590000000002
they really want because they're just

1462.32 --> 1467.039
attacking

1464.559 --> 1468.799
it's not about keeping a secret anymore

1467.039 --> 1471.279

that's literally what they're doing

1478.08 --> 1482.799
they're just attacking

i'm gonna do that right now

1666.32 --> 1669.84
let's see how long it lasts

1671.6 --> 1675.6399999999999
okay how do i do this

1679.74 --> 1703.48
[Music]

1711.039 --> 1713.6
all right

1714.59 --> 1719.039

1717.12 --> 1721.9189999999999
so no i'm not thinking about getting

1719.039 --> 1725.279
anything or doing anything

1721.919 --> 1726.64
it's not gonna help none of it is going

1725.279 --> 1729.279
to help

1726.64 --> 1731.919
i don't need any more suggestions on how

1729.279 --> 1732.799
to alter my life to supposedly improve

1731.919 --> 1735.279
it

1732.799 --> 1738.399
i appreciate the sentiment

1735.279 --> 1739.2
but i'm not taking advice i don't need

1738.399 --> 1739.61
it

1739.2 --> 1741.039
yeah

1739.61 --> 1745.4399999999998
[Music]

1741.039 --> 1745.44
anything that i can do i will do

1748.96 --> 1755.039
i don't get a garden

1752.96 --> 1758.0
yeah i don't have it

1755.039 --> 1758.0
i can't get it

1762.159 --> 1766.48
i could take some random

1764.399 --> 1768.4799999999998
like community garden thing that would

1766.48 --> 1770.72
be quite a distance away

1768.48 --> 1772.159
and that would absolutely not work out

1770.72 --> 1774.559
for me

1772.159 --> 1778.0
because there's no control or oversight

1774.559 --> 1780.48
like somebody could just like

1778.0 --> 1782.88
use freaking pesticides without telling

1780.48 --> 1784.72
anybody i wouldn't even know it would be

1782.88 --> 1786.48
in the ground i'm not going to do it i'm

1784.72 --> 1789.44
not going to share a garden with a bunch

1786.48 --> 1792.48
of numpties out there

1789.44 --> 1793.52
if i have a garden i want it to be my

1792.48 --> 1798.24
garden

1793.52 --> 1798.24
that's cornered off with fences

1798.559 --> 1803.48
so

1799.76 --> 1803.48
and they don't have that

1811.679 --> 1816.24
yeah and by the way i'm sorry for my

1813.76 --> 1819.12
rent earlier

1816.24 --> 1821.279
about the vaccines i know i know it's

1819.12 --> 1823.4399999999998
still terrible i know yeah those people

1821.279 --> 1825.279
really didn't deserve it

1823.44 --> 1828.0
some of you probably have family that

1825.279 --> 1828.98
died from it and all that and i do not

1828.0 --> 1830.159
mean to like

1828.98 --> 1832.48
[Music]

1830.159 --> 1833.7600000000002
pile on the hurt

1832.48 --> 1835.679
i get it

1833.76 --> 1838.96
but seriously

1835.679 --> 1842.3990000000001
at this point if you are still willing

1838.96 --> 1845.6000000000001
to go along with it you are too [ __ ]

1842.399 --> 1845.6
stupid to live

1846.399 --> 1852.2399999999998
if i anybody i know at this point

1849.84 --> 1853.9189999999999
that is going to for whatever reason say

1852.24 --> 1856.799
they're going to take it

1853.919 --> 1860.72
i will immediately disconnect them from

1856.799 --> 1863.519
my heart and consider them as died

1860.72 --> 1865.84
i don't want to know them anymore you

1863.519 --> 1865.84
see

1873.039 --> 1877.279
i really don't

1874.88 --> 1879.6000000000001
because i really am convinced that

1877.279 --> 1881.679
people that are now at this point still

1879.6 --> 1884.0
gonna take the shot

1881.679 --> 1888.0
deserve to die

1884.0 --> 1890.24
i mean it i really really mean it

1888.0 --> 1892.72
if you do it now you are too [ __ ]

1890.24 --> 1894.88
stupid to live

1892.72 --> 1897.44
it's better you just get the [ __ ] out of

1894.88 --> 1897.44
this world

1897.84 --> 1903.9189999999999
and be quick about it right don't want

1900.559 --> 1908.24
to be paying for another 5 or 10 years

1903.919 --> 1908.24
for your aggravated medical bills

1918.48 --> 1921.48
anyhow

1936.0 --> 1940.32
ah

1937.679 --> 1943.6000000000001
that sucks there with 306 i'm sorry i'm

1940.32 --> 1943.6
sorry to hear that for you

1947.44 --> 1954.3990000000001
but they're screwed look when you get it

1950.88 --> 1954.3990000000001
and that [ __ ] starts happening

1957.519 --> 1960.3990000000001
right

1958.88 --> 1963.679
if you get it

1960.399 --> 1966.32
and like the clots which are not clots

1963.679 --> 1968.24
by the way when they start happening

1966.32 --> 1969.519
it's not gonna stop

1968.24 --> 1972.0
you see

1969.519 --> 1973.919
could have one little piece removed

1972.0 --> 1976.32
that's just gonna keep growing because

1973.919 --> 1979.8400000000001
you literally have a genetically

1976.32 --> 1983.4399999999998
modified parasite growing in you then

1979.84 --> 1985.36
and it will keep doing that until you

1983.44 --> 1989.279
die

1985.36 --> 1991.039
so i'm sorry to report that

1989.279 --> 1994.919
derek

1991.039 --> 1994.919
your uncle's a dead man

2005.679 --> 2010.0800000000002
right but you should tell them to tell

2007.44 --> 2012.96
it exactly like that and don't get over

2010.08 --> 2013.6789999999999
enthusiastic be very strict about it do

2012.96 --> 2016.159
it

2013.679 --> 2018.3990000000001
sounds weird do it like i do

2016.159 --> 2021.1200000000001
no sympathy no like oh i don't want to

2018.399 --> 2023.36
lose no just say you're going to die

2021.12 --> 2025.6
this is how you're going to die you're

2023.36 --> 2027.9189999999999
going to have a parasite

2025.6 --> 2030.48
artificially made in laboratories

2027.919 --> 2032.64
genetically modified parasites grow

2030.48 --> 2035.76
inside of you

2032.64 --> 2038.0
that is not going to be removable

2035.76 --> 2040.48
and it's going to keep doing that until

2038.0 --> 2040.48
you die

2041.76 --> 2045.44
yeah

2043.12 --> 2047.36
i mean if somebody were considering

2045.44 --> 2049.679
taking a shot

2047.36 --> 2053.1189999999997
and i told them that i'm pretty sure i

2049.679 --> 2053.119
they'll probably not do it

2057.44 --> 2064.56
oh okay what not your uncle

2061.04 --> 2064.56
i thought you said that

2066.48 --> 2070.2400000000002
uncle

2067.76 --> 2071.9190000000003
our longtime neighbor

2070.24 --> 2075.7599999999998
what

2071.919 --> 2076.7999999999997
oh okay fine just a neighbor

2075.76 --> 2079.76
yeah yeah

2076.8 --> 2079.76
well i'd feel bad

2083.27 --> 2086.44
[Music]

2087.52 --> 2092.079
no it's a liar tony whitcomb

2090.32 --> 2094.56
that's a liar

2092.079 --> 2096.8
nobody's done that and nobody's gonna

2094.56 --> 2099.2799999999997
brag in chats how they've done that

2096.8 --> 2102.5600000000004
that's a liar that's a pharma shill that

2099.28 --> 2105.92
somebody that's paying being paid

2102.56 --> 2108.72
to lie about having jabs in order to

2105.92 --> 2109.6800000000003
soothe on other people's worries

2108.72 --> 2112.16
right

2109.68 --> 2115.359
it's literally a satanic piece of [ __ ]

2112.16 --> 2117.3199999999997
scumbag that's being paid by banks

2115.359 --> 2119.5989999999997
to spread the actual medical

2117.32 --> 2121.92
misinformation that will get people

2119.599 --> 2124.1600000000003
killed because they will think oh well

2121.92 --> 2125.76
maybe it's not that bad

2124.16 --> 2128.3199999999997
and then they die

2125.76 --> 2131.76
that's what this piece of [ __ ] is

2128.32 --> 2133.599
people that say that they do that

2131.76 --> 2136.48
they don't

2133.599 --> 2136.48
it's always a lie

2137.2 --> 2141.7599999999998
right now i've had a few people like was

2140.0 --> 2144.16
it two years i don't even remember their

2141.76 --> 2146.0
names that said that they were taking

2144.16 --> 2148.8799999999997
the jabs

2146.0 --> 2151.28
i'm not seeing them anymore now i told

2148.88 --> 2152.7200000000003
them back then you're gonna die

2151.28 --> 2157.4
well

2152.72 --> 2157.3999999999996
i haven't seen them back have you

2158.4 --> 2161.92
right

2159.52 --> 2164.96
but that's just like one or two that's

2161.92 --> 2165.92
not what the somebody say oh i took six

2164.96 --> 2168.64
no

2165.92 --> 2170.4
if you took six you're gonna be like

2168.64 --> 2173.04
sick

2170.4 --> 2174.4
you're not gonna have the energy left to

2173.04 --> 2177.359
troll

2174.4 --> 2180.1600000000003
some flat earther channel so it has to

2177.359 --> 2180.16
be a lie

2181.2 --> 2187.04
have most of jab people died by now no

2184.8 --> 2188.88
no no no no no

2187.04 --> 2189.68
no it's just the start

2188.88 --> 2192.56
oh

2189.68 --> 2195.04
the parasitic genetically modified

2192.56 --> 2197.2
organisms are still growing inside of

2195.04 --> 2198.64
them

2197.2 --> 2199.359
right

2198.64 --> 2202.3199999999997
so

2199.359 --> 2206.16
the original prediction was

2202.32 --> 2209.28
that within five years it's likely that

2206.16 --> 2210.16
like 95 of all the jab are going to be

2209.28 --> 2212.079
dead

2210.16 --> 2214.16
the ones that didn't get a saline shot

2212.079 --> 2216.8
because that's still an option but hey

2214.16 --> 2221.1189999999997
if you like take three

2216.8 --> 2223.76
you're very likely to have at least one

2221.119 --> 2225.6800000000003
non-saline shot included and hey one's

2223.76 --> 2227.6800000000003
just enough that's enough for the

2225.68 --> 2230.24
parasite implant

2227.68 --> 2232.64
to start growing in you never being able

2230.24 --> 2233.52
to be extracted again

2232.64 --> 2236.56
and

2233.52 --> 2236.56
this is going to be the end

2237.2 --> 2240.2
so

2260.96 --> 2263.96
uh

2281.04 --> 2286.72
they're 80 plus that's when they're all

2282.96 --> 2288.32
gonna die what what does that even mean

2286.72 --> 2290.48
i mean yeah if you're old and you're

2288.32 --> 2292.1600000000003
gonna be implanted with a parasite yeah

2290.48 --> 2294.72
that's gonna be

2292.16 --> 2296.3199999999997
fatal even quicker because your body

2294.72 --> 2299.4399999999996
does not have the regenerative

2296.32 --> 2302.32
capacities etc

2299.44 --> 2304.4
the old people but also the extremely

2302.32 --> 2306.6400000000003
young

2304.4 --> 2310.76
are at most risk

2306.64 --> 2310.7599999999998
from yeah dying

2314.24 --> 2318.4799999999996
a parasitic implants a living organism

2316.72 --> 2322.0
of some kind

2318.48 --> 2322.0
not in the traditional sense

2323.76 --> 2329.8390000000004
they're not like a a living organism but

2326.96 --> 2331.04
they are bio-organic they're like bio

2329.839 --> 2332.72
machines

2331.04 --> 2334.64
it's basically a

2332.72 --> 2337.2799999999997
nano technology

2334.64 --> 2338.96
bio nano technology

2337.28 --> 2341.599
parasite

2338.96 --> 2344.56
there's not actually a self-sufficient

2341.599 --> 2344.56
living organism

2349.28 --> 2353.119
right but you've seen the footage by now

2351.68 --> 2355.359
i mean

2353.119 --> 2358.6400000000003
reports about that have been going all

2355.359 --> 2359.7599999999998
around for like half a year already

2358.64 --> 2363.5989999999997
this is the

2359.76 --> 2363.599
last month or the month before

2364.48 --> 2368.56
it was even an item and it spread around

2366.8 --> 2371.3590000000004
all over the world a lot of doctors did

2368.56 --> 2372.7999999999997
that and where they had coroners just

2371.359 --> 2373.839
like

2372.8 --> 2376.8
remove

2373.839 --> 2381.119
this weird parasite thing

2376.8 --> 2383.04
from yeah vaccinated people that died

2381.119 --> 2384.96
from supposed blood clots in order to

2383.04 --> 2388.56
study that and yeah put it under

2384.96 --> 2390.2400000000002
microscope so it has been studied

2388.56 --> 2391.2799999999997
that's where i'm getting my conclusion

2390.24 --> 2393.359
from

2391.28 --> 2398.96
seems to be like a

2393.359 --> 2398.96
bio nano technological parasite

2402.4 --> 2406.319
[Music]

2404.4 --> 2410.52
oh you did oh that's your own [ __ ]

2406.319 --> 2410.52
problem dude i don't care

2413.04 --> 2418.72
i re it's really not my problem jarvis

2415.92 --> 2423.4
it's your problem

2418.72 --> 2423.3999999999996
don't expect any sympathy for me

2425.28 --> 2431.2000000000003
and it doesn't actually degrade yeah

2428.16 --> 2434.92
what supposedly degrades

2431.2 --> 2438.0789999999997
yeah what supposedly degrades is the

2434.92 --> 2441.6800000000003
effectiveness which there isn't any of

2438.079 --> 2444.079
that's what's supposed to go away yeah

2441.68 --> 2447.7599999999998
the actual [ __ ] that's been pumped into

2444.079 --> 2452.2400000000002
you is still there

2447.76 --> 2454.3190000000004
it's still there it is gonna grow

2452.24 --> 2457.68
unless you were one of the lucky ones

2454.319 --> 2460.8
and got saline shots both and you're

2457.68 --> 2462.8799999999997
extremely lucky

2460.8 --> 2465.28
if that's the case

2462.88 --> 2467.839
you can count your lucky stars just

2465.28 --> 2469.52
never do it again if you do then you

2467.839 --> 2470.48
deserve everything that will be coming

2469.52 --> 2473.48
to you

2470.48 --> 2473.48
everything

2481.28 --> 2487.119
i'm not talking about spike protein dude

2484.56 --> 2490.72
i'm not talking about any blabbering

2487.119 --> 2493.2000000000003
models i'm not talking about models that

2490.72 --> 2496.24
have been forced in your face about what

2493.2 --> 2499.4399999999996
supposedly is going on yeah i'm talking

2496.24 --> 2503.8799999999997
about actual results

2499.44 --> 2503.88
autopsies the stuff

2508.24 --> 2513.4399999999996
i don't even think that that is

2510.56 --> 2513.44
spike protein

2513.839 --> 2517.2799999999997
the supposed clots are not

2516.24 --> 2519.2799999999997
that

2517.28 --> 2521.9
they're nothing like that they're not

2519.28 --> 2527.76
protein blobs

2521.9 --> 2527.76
[Music]

2528.48 --> 2532.4
it's like different types of structures

2533.28 --> 2537.3190000000004
that are formed inside here

2537.599 --> 2543.76
so yeah it's all very nice that oh look

2540.72 --> 2548.0789999999997
at all this presuppositional data look

2543.76 --> 2552.1600000000003
at all this data that's all resting on

2548.079 --> 2555.28
the same shitty ass disproven model from

2552.16 --> 2559.44
the medical system about viruses

2555.28 --> 2562.4
yeah that literally does not exist

2559.44 --> 2566.079
has never been properly proven using

2562.4 --> 2569.04
scientific method was fraud every step

2566.079 --> 2570.4
of the way and there's still fraud now

2569.04 --> 2573.359
they don't work

2570.4 --> 2576.0
viruses don't exist it's all a fraud and

2573.359 --> 2578.56
they're just using it

2576.0 --> 2581.359
as a pretext to start medically

2578.56 --> 2584.7999999999997
experimenting with injected genetically

2581.359 --> 2584.7999999999997
modified parasites

2588.8 --> 2594.7200000000003
so dude i don't even think like this

2591.04 --> 2594.72
spike protein really exists

2596.4 --> 2603.599
it's all garbage all of it

2599.2 --> 2606.56
all lies all based on lines all of it

2603.599 --> 2608.88
all the things you hear about it every

2606.56 --> 2612.0
single argument from the medical system

2608.88 --> 2615.6800000000003
you hear that has any kind of approval

2612.0 --> 2617.04
or relation to virology is

2615.68 --> 2621.52
all

2617.04 --> 2623.52
lies hundred percent hundred percent

2621.52 --> 2626.16
hundred percent

2623.52 --> 2627.7599999999998
any medical model that presupposes

2626.16 --> 2630.56
viruses

2627.76 --> 2631.92
is false

2630.56 --> 2634.96
it's false

2631.92 --> 2636.56
everything tied into that is false it's

2634.96 --> 2639.119
all fraud

2636.56 --> 2639.119
all of it

2639.52 --> 2643.2
the only thing that i really trust is

2641.44 --> 2645.04
just what they pull out of people's

2643.2 --> 2647.2
bodies

2645.04 --> 2650.16
that's what i know is real because it's

2647.2 --> 2652.56
right there i'm looking at it

2650.16 --> 2654.24
yeah all this blah blah blah all these

2652.56 --> 2655.2799999999997
other things that are supposedly

2654.24 --> 2656.7999999999997
happening

2655.28 --> 2658.8
protein oh

2656.8 --> 2661.92
oh [ __ ] but

2658.8 --> 2664.48
oh garbage everything about that is

2661.92 --> 2666.7200000000003
garbage it's all science fiction stories

2664.48 --> 2669.359
the implant in your head

2666.72 --> 2671.839
so that you presuppose it's real

2669.359 --> 2674.48
so you presuppose that all that [ __ ]

2671.839 --> 2677.359
underneath it the medical model of

2674.48 --> 2679.44
viruses so that you think it's real

2677.359 --> 2681.52
because you presupposed it it's another

2679.44 --> 2682.48
globe earth guys

2681.52 --> 2685.7599999999998
yeah

2682.48 --> 2688.2400000000002
i mean oh just like

2685.76 --> 2691.0400000000004
all that stuff out there some kind of a

2688.24 --> 2693.2
star in the distance and yeah you know

2691.04 --> 2694.64
of course let's debate about how that

2693.2 --> 2696.56
works and

2694.64 --> 2698.7999999999997
how the light transfer works at that

2696.56 --> 2700.72
giant distance right in the meanwhile

2698.8 --> 2702.5600000000004
while you're spending your time on that

2700.72 --> 2704.72
you've been presupposing the earth is a

alternative sector every alternative

2714.64 --> 2720.319
medical person

2716.88 --> 2722.8
that presupposes viruses are real

2720.319 --> 2724.88
is all talking garbage

2722.8 --> 2726.2400000000002
all of it

2724.88 --> 2728.56
it's drunk

2726.24 --> 2732.0
there is no proof viruses are real there

2728.56 --> 2732.96
is no medical scientific

what's his freaking name again uh

2806.8 --> 2809.2000000000003
damn it

2814.96 --> 2821.68
uh was it space busters

2818.48 --> 2824.48
i linked up the like the documentary a

2821.68 --> 2826.319
while ago it was really good

2824.48 --> 2827.68
let's see let's see if i can find it

2826.319 --> 2830.16
back

2827.68 --> 2833.52
i think i posted it in letters early

2830.16 --> 2833.52

2835.119 --> 2837.6800000000003
where is it

damn it

2843.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
where is it

2854.88 --> 2859.9900000000002
can't find it

2858.0 --> 2864.989
have to manually look for it

2859.99 --> 2864.9889999999996
[Music]

2870.64 --> 2875.04
wait did his channel get deleted

2876.4 --> 2881.6800000000003
what the

2878.64 --> 2881.68
what where is it

2885.28 --> 2888.559
oh wait no it's still there

2889.119 --> 2893.2000000000003
all right let me find the right link

2897.04 --> 2902.4
right you asked about

2899.68 --> 2905.359
specifically well here it is i mean this

2902.4 --> 2907.44
guy has made the most elaborate

2905.359 --> 2908.7999999999997
presentation that i've come across thus

2907.44 --> 2912.359
far

2908.8 --> 2912.3590000000004
so here you go

2922.079 --> 2928.2000000000003
are you talking about george sanford i'm

2924.079 --> 2928.2000000000003
seeing your message right there

2941.04 --> 2944.319
so did you get that link

2946.8 --> 2950.2000000000003
steamy traveler

2963.76 --> 2971.079
and there's many more he made so

2966.559 --> 2971.079
he's been really busy with it

2975.599 --> 2982.6400000000003
right and it's not just fierology okay

2979.44 --> 2985.68
it is even germ theory itself

2982.64 --> 2989.1189999999997
that's the most egregious part

2985.68 --> 2990.5589999999997
is that germ theory itself is a blatant

2989.119 --> 2994.559
fraud

2990.559 --> 2995.92
which envirology was based

2994.559 --> 2998.4
off

2995.92 --> 3003.04
germ theory

2998.4 --> 3006.64
it is a fraud upon a fraud incredible

3003.04 --> 3010.16
it conjured up an invisible

3006.64 --> 3013.68
thing an inanimate invisible thing that

3010.16 --> 3015.52
supposedly acts like an animate that's

3013.68 --> 3017.1189999999997
that supposedly is addressed like it's

3015.52 --> 3019.599
alive

3017.119 --> 3020.559
that does all these things it's all a

3019.599 --> 3023.3590000000004
lie

3020.559 --> 3026.1600000000003
everything about it is a lie

3023.359 --> 3029.2
even conditions out there attributed to

3026.16 --> 3032.319
viruses are just a lie

3029.2 --> 3032.319
it's not true

3032.48 --> 3038.16
they just associate a made-up virus with

3035.92 --> 3041.839
a condition

3038.16 --> 3041.839
yeah magic that's right

3042.559 --> 3045.92
word magic

3044.319 --> 3050.4
make belief

3045.92 --> 3050.4
a story that people can latch on to

3051.2 --> 3055.52
that's all it is

3052.96 --> 3058.48
and i used to be terrified of viruses

3055.52 --> 3060.16
until i realized it's just not real like

3058.48 --> 3063.599
not at all

3060.16 --> 3066.96
at all nothing about it is real

3063.599 --> 3070.0
yeah nothing about viruses is real every

3066.96 --> 3070.96
warning you've ever had for viruses is

3070.0 --> 3073.839
fake

3070.96 --> 3076.079
all of it because they don't exist like

3073.839 --> 3078.359
they're not even misidentified or like

3076.079 --> 3082.1600000000003
oh they're slightly off no it's like

3078.359 --> 3085.52
entirely made up entirely

3082.16 --> 3087.7599999999998
it doesn't exist at all

3085.52 --> 3090.24
now the conditions

3087.76 --> 3093.0400000000004
yeah you can get sick and that sickness

3090.24 --> 3095.2799999999997
might be associated with a certain virus

3093.04 --> 3097.68
within the establishment medical

3095.28 --> 3100.2400000000002
right doesn't mean it's actually caused

3097.68 --> 3103.04
by a virus it's usually related to other

3100.24 --> 3103.04
things happening

3103.28 --> 3106.88
right because sickness

3106.96 --> 3111.04
those things you can get

3109.119 --> 3113.44
those are conditions

3111.04 --> 3115.7599999999998
right conditions of the body where you

3113.44 --> 3117.76
at where you get sickness

3115.76 --> 3120.7200000000003
that's real the sickness can absolutely

3117.76 --> 3121.92
be real it's just that the proclaimed

3120.72 --> 3125.5989999999997
cause

3121.92 --> 3128.96
of viruses is complete or [ __ ] that's

3125.599 --> 3128.96
not how it actually works

3131.599 --> 3137.119
no you haven't you [ __ ] liar get the

3134.559 --> 3138.96
[ __ ] out of my chat cats you [ __ ]

3137.119 --> 3143.599
[ __ ]

3138.96 --> 3146.16
you [ __ ] lying piece of [ __ ]

3143.599 --> 3150.7200000000003
nobody has seen viruses under a

3146.16 --> 3153.839
microscope you lying scumbag

3150.72 --> 3153.839
nobody has

3158.559 --> 3164.88
i don't know if germs are real oh yeah

3161.04 --> 3166.64
yeah they are bacteria are real

3164.88 --> 3168.96
absolutely

3166.64 --> 3170.16
they don't infect you

3168.96 --> 3172.88
though

3170.16 --> 3175.7599999999998
like a hostile entity

3172.88 --> 3177.44
to try and take you over and destroy you

3175.76 --> 3179.3590000000004
yeah that's what they don't do no

3177.44 --> 3181.68
bacteria are actually

3179.359 --> 3184.24
good organisms organisms that are

3181.68 --> 3187.9199999999996
critical to our function

3184.24 --> 3192.7999999999997
we have are loaded with bacteria they

3187.92 --> 3196.8
are literally part of our bodily society

3192.8 --> 3198.88
bacteria are real we need them

3196.8 --> 3201.04
we need them hard

3198.88 --> 3204.7200000000003
very very hard

3201.04 --> 3207.04
they're essential for our proper bodily

3204.72 --> 3209.1189999999997
functions

3207.04 --> 3210.96
if you don't have the proper bacteria

3209.119 --> 3213.119
you're gonna die

3210.96 --> 3214.96
you need them for your guts you need

3213.119 --> 3217.92
them for your skin

3214.96 --> 3220.839
you you need them for everywhere

3217.92 --> 3223.76
every organ has its necessary

3220.839 --> 3226.4
bacteria or at least most of them

3223.76 --> 3228.88
i'm not a full biological expert but i

3226.4 --> 3231.119
know this

3228.88 --> 3233.92
what causes infections

3231.119 --> 3236.559
uh well an infection is effectively a

3233.92 --> 3239.2000000000003
healing process

3236.559 --> 3242.88
right you can get dirt

3239.2 --> 3245.5989999999997
and toxic waste residue

3242.88 --> 3249.52
like even wounds can have like

3245.599 --> 3250.48
toxic influences and then bacteria

3249.52 --> 3253.92
sometimes

3250.48 --> 3256.16
but also other things will get in there

3253.92 --> 3258.4
and basically

3256.16 --> 3260.7999999999997
try to clean it up

3258.4 --> 3265.839
they just try to clean it up

3260.8 --> 3265.8390000000004
you see bacteria clean up poison

3265.92 --> 3270.079
you get it

3267.2 --> 3273.7599999999998
it cleans it up

3270.079 --> 3273.76
does dirt have germs yes

3274.24 --> 3279.7599999999998
and that's why when you're a very very

3276.4 --> 3282.1600000000003
little kid it's actually great to go

3279.76 --> 3286.1600000000003
into a forest clean forest non-toxic

3282.16 --> 3288.3999999999996
non-poisonous no pesticides anywhere

3286.16 --> 3292.5589999999997
and just have them shove dirt in their

3288.4 --> 3294.96
mouth from the ground no [ __ ] dirt

3292.559 --> 3297.8390000000004
it's good because then they get all

3294.96 --> 3300.319
these wild bacteria that their body can

3297.839 --> 3303.04
assimilate and put to good use it'll

3300.319 --> 3306.4
strengthen their system why because

3303.04 --> 3308.64
bacteria eat toxic waste

3306.4 --> 3311.119
it saves you from poisoning you

3308.64 --> 3313.04
understand bacteria

3311.119 --> 3313.92
save you

3313.04 --> 3315.359
from

3313.92 --> 3319.0
poisoning

3315.359 --> 3319.0
that's what they do

3324.88 --> 3330.319
right so if you have an infection it's

3326.88 --> 3332.559
usually because it's not clean

3330.319 --> 3335.44
or your overall regenerative

3332.559 --> 3337.76
capabilities are not good

3335.44 --> 3339.2000000000003
you haven't like a hormonal or whatever

3337.76 --> 3341.8390000000004
imbalance

3339.2 --> 3344.319
that causes trouble

3341.839 --> 3346.24
and then you can get an infection an

3344.319 --> 3349.359
infection is like

3346.24 --> 3351.4399999999996
the body is like stalled

3349.359 --> 3354.0
being able to heal something properly

3351.44 --> 3356.2400000000002
and it can get very painful it's like a

3354.0 --> 3359.44
mini war that happens but it's not a war

3356.24 --> 3362.3999999999996
against bacteria you see it's a war

3359.44 --> 3366.079
against the toxins that are created

3362.4 --> 3367.6800000000003
locally that might not be able to like

3366.079 --> 3369.44
transfer right

3367.68 --> 3372.16
if there's like a wound

3369.44 --> 3373.52
that isolates the flow of the things

3372.16 --> 3376.96
around it

3373.52 --> 3379.7599999999998
so every cell has like

3376.96 --> 3382.319
toxic waste they need to dump constantly

3379.76 --> 3384.3190000000004
they not just need to get

3382.319 --> 3386.48
food in them

3384.319 --> 3391.44
oxygen and all that they also need to

3386.48 --> 3392.88
dump [ __ ] if that [ __ ] cannot be like

3391.44 --> 3395.359
passed out

3392.88 --> 3397.28
through the blood vessels or whatever it

3395.359 --> 3399.52
can cause problems

3397.28 --> 3402.1600000000003
that is usually that's what i think

3399.52 --> 3404.64
causes the infections it's the heaping

3402.16 --> 3406.64
up of toxic waste

3404.64 --> 3410.24
that's also why you could get gangrene

3406.64 --> 3411.92
right because it's cut off

3410.24 --> 3414.9599999999996
it's like the blood can't flow through

3411.92 --> 3416.48
it anymore it's gonna die off

3414.96 --> 3419.839
because it's

3416.48 --> 3421.359
toxifying to death

3419.839 --> 3423.599
that's what i think is actually

3421.359 --> 3425.2
happening bacteria are not

3423.599 --> 3427.6800000000003
infectious

3425.2 --> 3430.5589999999997
invasive agents

3427.68 --> 3433.2799999999997
i mean bacteria can be weaponized they

3430.559 --> 3436.3190000000004
can be put into under very unnatural

3433.28 --> 3438.48
circumstances so that they respond

3436.319 --> 3440.5589999999997
unnaturally and extremely aggressive

3438.48 --> 3441.599
right this is what for example happened

3440.559 --> 3446.119
with

3441.599 --> 3446.119
what's it called again uh anthrax

3446.88 --> 3452.559
the thing is though

3449.599 --> 3454.1600000000003
the if the toxic conditions are removed

3452.559 --> 3456.1600000000003
from such bacteria that have been

3454.16 --> 3458.5589999999997
weaponized

3456.16 --> 3461.2
they immediately start to

3458.559 --> 3463.119
revert back to their natural state and

3461.2 --> 3464.5589999999997
become

3463.119 --> 3467.6800000000003
well

3464.559 --> 3467.6800000000003
symbiotic again

3467.92 --> 3471.92
so

3468.96 --> 3474.16
the only way to actually have hostile

3471.92 --> 3476.2400000000002
bacteria is to weaponize them is to

3474.16 --> 3479.52
literally put them into terrible

3476.24 --> 3481.4399999999996
unnatural poisonous conditions

3479.52 --> 3483.839
and then

3481.44 --> 3485.44
they've been all like they're in hell

3483.839 --> 3487.119
and they're fighting and they're being

3485.44 --> 3488.88
super aggressive to their environment

3487.119 --> 3490.6400000000003
and if you then put it in somebody's

3488.88 --> 3492.079
body yeah it's just gonna attack the

3490.64 --> 3492.96
body

3492.079 --> 3495.04
right

3492.96 --> 3497.76
until

3495.04 --> 3500.0
it eventually realizes like through the

3497.76 --> 3502.1600000000003
reproduction that does happen in the

3500.0 --> 3504.24
body if it's if it's in there it starts

3502.16 --> 3506.96
to realize like wait it's not the toxic

3504.24 --> 3509.1189999999997
conditions anymore

3506.96 --> 3509.119
so

3509.839 --> 3517.04
we can just like return back to normal

3514.079 --> 3519.2000000000003
the toxicity is over

3517.04 --> 3522.16
that's how i see it

3519.2 --> 3526.5589999999997
it's my personal researched

3522.16 --> 3526.5589999999997
eclectic layman's opinion

3527.44 --> 3533.599
and i have a right to that opinion

3531.28 --> 3536.3190000000004
and i'm not giving out medical advice

3533.599 --> 3537.28
i'm just telling you how i think it

3536.319 --> 3538.88
works

3537.28 --> 3543.1600000000003
and i've based this

3538.88 --> 3543.1600000000003
on some wide research

3544.64 --> 3548.8799999999997
because i take this subject very

3546.319 --> 3548.88
seriously

3551.44 --> 3556.96
how do poisons attack the body no

3554.079 --> 3559.119
they're just in there

3556.96 --> 3561.599
i dude

3559.119 --> 3564.079
i am not a microbiologist steamy

3561.599 --> 3564.079
traveler

3564.799 --> 3569.28
i'm just passing on what i've been

3566.88 --> 3569.28
learning

3571.839 --> 3575.7599999999998
from a variety of people including my

3574.4 --> 3578.0
dad who's been

3575.76 --> 3580.6400000000003
deeper studying into it

3578.0 --> 3580.64
than i have

3581.119 --> 3586.6400000000003
so yeah i'm not a microbiologist you get

3584.079 --> 3589.3590000000004
it steamy traveler please stop asking

3586.64 --> 3590.8799999999997
questions you would ask like a medical

3589.359 --> 3593.839
doctor that's like

3590.88 --> 3595.599
into this for like 20 30 years i'm not

3593.839 --> 3597.68
that person

3595.599 --> 3601.04
i don't know all the details i haven't

3597.68 --> 3603.5989999999997
like studied a thousand hours

3601.04 --> 3606.5589999999997
reading material

3603.599 --> 3608.88
on how it's supposed to work

3606.559 --> 3610.799
i don't even know that elaborately how

3608.88 --> 3613.119
it's supposed to work i just know that

3610.799 --> 3614.64
how it's supposed to work is based on

3613.119 --> 3618.2400000000002
fraud

3614.64 --> 3622.16
provable historically provable fraud

3618.24 --> 3622.16
that's enough information for me

3622.799 --> 3627.92
to figure out what's going on and how

3625.92 --> 3629.599
it's going on how the medical

3627.92 --> 3631.839
misinformation

3629.599 --> 3634.079
based on faulty science

3631.839 --> 3636.0
original faulty science is really

3634.079 --> 3637.44
happening like how it's spreading how

3636.0 --> 3639.68
the ideas are spreading how the

3637.44 --> 3642.799
misconceptions are spreading

3639.68 --> 3645.7599999999998
that's what i'm much more focused on

3642.799 --> 3647.599
not the details of what precisely

3645.76 --> 3649.6800000000003
supposed to happen

3647.599 --> 3651.6800000000003
on the microbiological level i don't

3649.68 --> 3654.0789999999997
know those details

3651.68 --> 3657.1189999999997
i don't even trust those details because

3654.079 --> 3660.4
again it's all based on fraudulent

3657.119 --> 3663.359
science why should i trust research

3660.4 --> 3666.76
that's based on faulty premise why would

3663.359 --> 3666.7599999999998
i do that

3671.04 --> 3676.799

right it's just oh you this are you a

4121.359 --> 4126.0
doctor or you're dead oh you think you

i find weed cures most things yeah

4152.239 --> 4157.2789999999995
i'd like some of that too

4157.279 --> 4162.2390000000005
first

4159.359 --> 4164.08
and then i can think about the weed

4162.239 --> 4167.08
again

4164.08 --> 4167.08
maybe

4184.239 --> 4187.239

dude

4217.52 --> 4222.080000000001

4222.56 --> 4226.320000000001
i'm kind of done about the subject

4224.08 --> 4228.48
anyway so you can just

4226.32 --> 4231.719
be deleted and ignored because i can do

4228.48 --> 4231.718999999999
that too

4233.04 --> 4237.6
right but i do know that there is one

4235.36 --> 4241.28
thing that pisses off the trolls more

4237.6 --> 4243.4400000000005
than anything else out there right

4241.28 --> 4244.88
and that is to see

4243.44 --> 4247.28
people

4244.88 --> 4250.2390000000005
actually donating to my paypal and

4247.28 --> 4252.5599999999995
telling me in the chat

4250.239 --> 4255.36

4252.56 --> 4257.52
dick of these chill scumbags

4255.36 --> 4260.4
more than anything else right we can say

4257.52 --> 4262.0
all the things we want but if you prove

4260.4 --> 4264.239
that i'm actually

4262.0 --> 4267.44
successful

4264.239 --> 4271.678999999999
that really gets to them because this

4267.44 --> 4272.48

4271.679 --> 4274.56
he

4272.48 --> 4277.759999999999
is like gloating

4274.56 --> 4280.96
gloating over my poverty he's been like

4277.76 --> 4282.719

manipulating people people catch on and

4634.64 --> 4641.360000000001
then everybody avoid you like the plague

4641.36 --> 4646.5599999999995
to not have to listen to you

4644.48 --> 4649.5599999999995

the spine that

4983.679 --> 4987.36

there's a 33 involved it becomes extra

or are they actually wizards right and

5074.96 --> 5080.4800000000005
they got the 33 because they're wizards

aren't real

then yeah it's just if i see something

5092.4 --> 5097.199
with 33 i'm just extra cautious

5095.28 --> 5099.759999999999

i mean i'm already great i've had like a

5242.639 --> 5247.1990000000005
lot of donations now

5244.88 --> 5248.8
and so i'm like super relieved at the

5247.199 --> 5250.638999999999
moment

5248.8 --> 5252.8
i'm like nothing can break my day at

5250.639 --> 5255.76
this point nothing

5252.8 --> 5255.76
this is awesome

5257.28 --> 5261.199
this is like the best day i've had in

5259.52 --> 5264.2390000000005
like a week

5261.199 --> 5266.638999999999
thank you so much guys for supporting me

5264.239 --> 5267.599999999999
and thank you for being a witness to

5266.639 --> 5269.52
that

5267.6 --> 5274.280000000001
troll scum

5269.52 --> 5274.280000000001
thank you for witnessing my success

5284.56 --> 5288.56
cat skank sniper well technically he's

5286.56 --> 5291.1990000000005
not a chat skank

5288.56 --> 5293.679
you see a jet skank is not a troll a jet

5291.199 --> 5296.48
skank is just kind of a

5293.679 --> 5299.04
a philosophical opponent that's a coward

5296.48 --> 5300.48
that just only blabbers

5299.04 --> 5301.5199999999995
and avoids

5300.48 --> 5304.08
right

5301.52 --> 5307.1990000000005
a chat skank is somebody that will go

5304.08 --> 5310.48
into a discussion with you a troll

5307.199 --> 5312.799999999999
doesn't they just try to [ __ ] you up

5310.48 --> 5314.799999999999
and keep banning like making stock

5312.8 --> 5316.2390000000005
accounts that's what a troll does a chat

5314.8 --> 5319.360000000001
skank

5316.239 --> 5321.599999999999
like when i'm on qe live on a tuesday

5319.36 --> 5323.44
i'm in the chat that's chat skanking

5321.6 --> 5324.639
because i could go on a panel but i

5323.44 --> 5326.719
don't wanna

5324.639 --> 5329.12
that's chat skanking it's a big

5326.719 --> 5329.12
difference

5329.44 --> 5332.719
but yeah

5330.88 --> 5336.36
understandable

5332.719 --> 5336.36
understandable mistake

5344.48 --> 5349.199
i think i'm amazing

5347.04 --> 5353.04
well i'd like to think of myself as a

5349.199 --> 5356.879999999999
mason but i'm not part of the masons

5353.04 --> 5356.88
i'm not part of that organization

5357.84 --> 5362.96
i'm just like a guy that's been like i

5360.239 --> 5365.12
am going to assimilate your information

5362.96 --> 5366.2390000000005
like i think that what you've kept

5365.12 --> 5368.5599999999995
secret

5366.239 --> 5370.48
is going to be exposed and i'm going to

5368.56 --> 5372.0
master it

5370.48 --> 5374.08
so i'm like a

5372.0 --> 5375.88
you could say i'm like a

5374.08 --> 5378.639
solitary

5375.88 --> 5380.639
disocculted mason

5378.639 --> 5383.28
open

5380.639 --> 5387.36
you said what

5383.28 --> 5389.28
200 really a man like me really

5387.36 --> 5392.0
have you tried sending it in in smaller

5389.28 --> 5394.639
amounts

would be great

5400.32 --> 5404.679

try sending it in like uh

5421.679 --> 5426.4800000000005

5424.719 --> 5428.159
never even seen somebody donate that

5426.48 --> 5430.5599999999995
high number

i don't know how quick your chat speed

5493.76 --> 5496.92
is so

5515.6 --> 5519.639
dude you just came in here

5527.52 --> 5533.84
i was mostly just talking to the troll

5529.76 --> 5533.84
and to the the other guys in chat

5539.04 --> 5543.44
you can hide them just with me

5541.199 --> 5543.44
but

5544.239 --> 5549.839999999999
like don't hide them just

5546.96 --> 5552.719
like oh yeah yeah it is hiding right

5549.84 --> 5555.92
just hiding in yeah

5552.719 --> 5555.92
hey gadget inspector

5559.36 --> 5564.8589999999995
yeah right back

5561.8 --> 5564.859
[Music]

5567.36 --> 5571.28
right well make sure though at the price

5569.679 --> 5572.84
of adam because there's other people in

5571.28 --> 5575.92
the chat that

5572.84 --> 5577.92
well might be newcomers and they're not

5575.92 --> 5579.84
trolls it's just as soon as they

5577.92 --> 5583.32
reveal what they really are that's when

5579.84 --> 5583.32
you can ban them

5583.36 --> 5586.88
[Music]

5597.11 --> 5601.49
[Music]

5603.54 --> 5606.729
[Music]

5607.6 --> 5610.96
okay

5608.719 --> 5613.199
so a man like me are you gonna try it

5610.96 --> 5615.52
again

5613.199 --> 5617.44
or are you like that guy

5615.52 --> 5620.56
yesterday

5617.44 --> 5620.5599999999995
that then doesn't do it

5625.28 --> 5630.159
anyway

5627.44 --> 5633.36
it would be great but i've already like

5630.159 --> 5636.32
i got enough to like get some food

5633.36 --> 5638.0
i'm looking a lot i'm looking forward to

5636.32 --> 5641.199
it a lot

5638.0 --> 5641.199
i really really am

5643.12 --> 5646.88
it's like my stomach is awakening again

5645.44 --> 5650.5599999999995
like oh

5646.88 --> 5653.28
you can eat okay let's get hungry

5650.56 --> 5655.360000000001
because when i know that i can't eat

5653.28 --> 5657.199
i'm just my hunger like kind of just

5655.36 --> 5659.839999999999
dies down because it it becomes

5657.199 --> 5659.839999999999
burdensome

5660.0 --> 5663.36
sounds all very dramatic but yeah i

5661.679 --> 5666.159
haven't really eaten all that much in

5663.36 --> 5666.159
the last two days

5667.679 --> 5673.159
and like dried bread is not exactly

5670.159 --> 5673.159
satisfying

5673.36 --> 5675.759999999999
anyway

5679.04 --> 5686.28
anybody watch beth destroy no

5682.48 --> 5686.28
i don't watch bath

5692.08 --> 5698.8
okay so he went against a science refire

5696.239 --> 5698.799999999999
that's cool

5698.96 --> 5705.52
have i spoken about the former protest

5701.52 --> 5705.52
yeah of course i have of course

5706.239 --> 5712.159
i mean not too extensively

5709.92 --> 5712.159
because

5712.23 --> 5715.44
[Music]

5713.52 --> 5716.96
there is already a lot of attention for

5715.44 --> 5719.44
it in the alternative sector there

5716.96 --> 5721.16
really is there's a lot of videos out

5719.44 --> 5723.919999999999
there and that's pretty awesome

5721.16 --> 5726.4
[Music]

5723.92 --> 5728.2390000000005
but yeah i mean it's my freaking country

5726.4 --> 5730.638999999999
i'm in the middle of it i am worried

5728.239 --> 5730.638999999999
about it

5730.719 --> 5736.32
because if they're gonna fail

5733.76 --> 5737.76
that literally means the end of my

5736.32 --> 5739.5199999999995
country

5737.76 --> 5741.52
like completely

5739.52 --> 5743.76
that's gonna mean that there might

5741.52 --> 5745.92
literally not be a netherlands anymore

5743.76 --> 5748.56
in 10 years

5745.92 --> 5751.4400000000005
because if then like in that condition

5748.56 --> 5755.360000000001
if we lose our farmers

5751.44 --> 5758.159
and then a world war is gonna break out

5755.36 --> 5760.159
say goodbye

5758.159 --> 5762.799999999999
say goodbye it's over

5760.159 --> 5762.799999999999
that happens

5763.6 --> 5770.0
because we will just

5766.32 --> 5772.239
be like a city cut off

5770.0 --> 5773.52
a giant city-state cut off from food

5772.239 --> 5774.638999999999
sources then

5773.52 --> 5777.040000000001
and

5774.639 --> 5778.159000000001
that's going to mean serious hunger

5777.04 --> 5782.08
chaos

5778.159 --> 5782.08
and probably just destruction

5782.239 --> 5787.839999999999
so yeah they're they can't lose

5785.52 --> 5789.679
they the farmers cannot lose this one if

5787.84 --> 5793.52
they do

5789.679 --> 5795.679
we're in more trouble than i can imagine

5793.52 --> 5797.92
like if they lose this

5795.679 --> 5800.96
then i will be thinking probably not

5797.92 --> 5804.0
doing but thinking of where do i go to

5800.96 --> 5804.0
flee this country

5807.36 --> 5811.599999999999
but let's hope it doesn't get to that

5809.199 --> 5814.4
point let's hope

5811.6 --> 5815.280000000001
people don't allow it right because i

5814.4 --> 5819.04
mean

5815.28 --> 5821.199
the public is very very sick of this

5819.04 --> 5824.4
government now it's been worse than it's

5821.199 --> 5826.5599999999995
ever been in netherlands history it's

5824.4 --> 5828.159
never been this bad

5826.56 --> 5830.2390000000005
right

5828.159 --> 5832.799999999999
in the sense that disapproval from the

5830.239 --> 5834.879999999999
public has never been this high

5832.8 --> 5836.4800000000005
in the dutch history in the entire

5834.88 --> 5838.84
history of the country it's never been

5836.48 --> 5843.199
this bad

5838.84 --> 5845.1990000000005
so does that mean it's gonna stop

5843.199 --> 5846.32
or does it mean that the people are just

5845.199 --> 5848.5599999999995
gonna be

5846.32 --> 5849.84
we don't like it and it's it's still

5848.56 --> 5851.92
gonna happen

5849.84 --> 5855.119000000001
you see i'm not too certain about that

5851.92 --> 5856.0
part like are the people actually

5855.119 --> 5858.08
still

5856.0 --> 5860.08
do we still have enough grassroots

5858.08 --> 5861.5199999999995
strength and will in ourselves to

5860.08 --> 5863.76
actually

5861.52 --> 5865.76
kick them out because they just refuse

5863.76 --> 5868.2390000000005
to leave

5865.76 --> 5870.159000000001
and what is the dutch military actually

5868.239 --> 5873.36
like

5870.159 --> 5875.119
i think it's gone through oh

5873.36 --> 5878.639
like me

5875.119 --> 5878.639
that's awesome let me check

5881.28 --> 5885.84
not seeing it yet

5883.04 --> 5885.84
might take a while

5888.96 --> 5894.64
but uh

5891.54 --> 5894.64
[Music]

5900.639 --> 5904.639
yeah i know pgcnet that's what i'm

5903.199 --> 5907.36
worried about

5904.639 --> 5909.679
if we retain our farmers then we could

5907.36 --> 5911.04
in the middle of europe collapsing

5909.679 --> 5912.32
heavily

5911.04 --> 5914.639
then we could

5912.32 --> 5917.599999999999
look if we have the farmers we still

5914.639 --> 5919.76
have a chance to secede europe

5917.6 --> 5924.88
if we do not have the farmers we have

5919.76 --> 5926.639
absolutely not a single shred of chance

5924.88 --> 5928.96
to get out of europe because we would

5926.639 --> 5930.0
not be able to survive it

5928.96 --> 5933.56
you see

5930.0 --> 5936.4
with the farmers we can still have

5933.56 --> 5938.639
self-sufficiency that's the massive

5936.4 --> 5941.28
massive difference that's why it's so

5938.639 --> 5945.04
critical what's going on right now

5941.28 --> 5945.04
that the farmers succeed

5946.32 --> 5950.84
in staving off the crazy crazy

5949.679 --> 5952.639
eugenics

5950.84 --> 5955.360000000001
policies

5952.639 --> 5957.76
klaus schwab policies

5955.36 --> 5959.28
did you know that literally

5957.76 --> 5961.4400000000005
this wednesday when there was this

5959.28 --> 5963.199
meeting i think i talked about that like

5961.44 --> 5965.839999999999
last week that they were going to have

5963.199 --> 5967.04
like a final meeting to negotiate

5965.84 --> 5969.119000000001
farmers and

5967.04 --> 5971.119
and the cabinet

5969.119 --> 5973.599999999999
that

5971.119 --> 5976.0
actually went over there was it him i

5973.6 --> 5978.719
think it was him or another one and that

5976.0 --> 5981.36
they actually like had the gall to tell

5978.719 --> 5984.4800000000005
the farmers

5981.36 --> 5985.839999999999
why don't you eat bugs

5984.48 --> 5987.919999999999
seriously

5985.84 --> 5990.32
they went to the farm

5987.92 --> 5991.52
supposedly for negotiation with the

5990.32 --> 5993.679
protest

5991.52 --> 5995.679
and then they said

5993.679 --> 5998.159
why don't you just

5995.679 --> 6000.8
grow bugs

5998.159 --> 6002.879999999999
that's what they did they literally just

6000.8 --> 6004.159000000001
like in your face like

6002.88 --> 6007.1990000000005
yeah

6004.159 --> 6009.119
why don't you grow bugs

6007.199 --> 6010.879999999999
to like a milk farmer

6009.119 --> 6012.48
like

6010.88 --> 6017.400000000001
unbelievable

6012.48 --> 6017.4
so insulted it is unreal

6032.159 --> 6035.159
anyway

6038.96 --> 6042.639
hmm

6040.719 --> 6044.88
yeah a man like me i don't know what you

6042.639 --> 6047.4400000000005
tried but it's not worked it hasn't

6044.88 --> 6047.4400000000005
worked yet

6047.52 --> 6050.88
unless there's a weird delay of some

6049.44 --> 6053.36
kind

6050.88 --> 6056.36
are you sure you've entered the right

6053.36 --> 6056.36
address

6066.0 --> 6070.0
marbles are not oblate spheroids no i

6068.08 --> 6071.84
hope not

6070.0 --> 6074.96
it's gonna be very tough playing with

6071.84 --> 6078.66
marbles they're all blade spheroids

probably trolling no i i don't think so

6093.04 --> 6098.32
drunk and bullet maybe

6095.92 --> 6100.88
i hope not that would be a real dickish

6098.32 --> 6100.88
thing to do

6101.119 --> 6105.679
but i mean a man like me is just kind of

6103.52 --> 6110.040000000001
a he is a flat earther that does also

6105.679 --> 6110.04
like hang around in chats and all that

6120.719 --> 6124.8
i mean if he were trolling then i'd ban

6122.8 --> 6126.8
him

6124.8 --> 6129.119000000001
because that's just a really nasty thing

6126.8 --> 6129.119000000001
to do

6133.6 --> 6137.52
kind of like the cycle guy from two days

6135.92 --> 6139.28
ago i should have just banned him he

6137.52 --> 6140.96
said oh i'm gonna donate and then he

6139.28 --> 6144.32
just didn't

6140.96 --> 6144.32
and that really sucks

6144.8 --> 6148.92
especially if you're really hungry

6174.239 --> 6177.239
what

6184.719 --> 6190.56
oh [ __ ]

6187.28 --> 6193.04
it was a fake one

6190.56 --> 6193.04
the hell

6201.92 --> 6205.76
yeah it was a fake a man like me you

6204.0 --> 6209.679
scumbag

6205.76 --> 6209.679
you filthy [ __ ] scumbag

6210.08 --> 6214.04
i'll screw you then

6219.28 --> 6224.0
all right i'm giving you a wrench so

6220.719 --> 6224.0
that's not gonna happen again

6224.159 --> 6232.239
i guess that the real man like me wasn't

6226.96 --> 6234.6
gonna donate 200 dollars to my paypal

6232.239 --> 6237.759
oh well

6249.92 --> 6253.32
exporter of food

6251.52 --> 6257.040000000001
right but that's also our

6253.32 --> 6257.04
self-sufficiency right there

6257.44 --> 6260.44
right

6269.84 --> 6273.92
like

6270.8 --> 6276.639
technically export a stable export is

6273.92 --> 6278.08
like especially a food is the survival

6276.639 --> 6280.400000000001
that's like the

6278.08 --> 6282.1
self-sufficiently survival ability of a

6286.88 --> 6290.2390000000005
you're welcome a man like me i know

6288.8 --> 6292.8
you've seen you i've seen you around for

6290.239 --> 6294.638999999999
a long time

6292.8 --> 6297.119000000001
so i take it you're not going to donate

6294.639 --> 6297.119
200

6297.92 --> 6303.84
probably

6300.0 --> 6303.84
a little out of your reach

6322.96 --> 6328.32
yeah i was at first i thought like uh

6325.52 --> 6330.639
well it's not just may today so maybe it

6328.32 --> 6332.5599999999995
is him i never i don't remember checking

6330.639 --> 6334.88
a man like me's official channel but

6332.56 --> 6336.8
then when i checked this guy he was like

6334.88 --> 6339.6
oh now he has actually all kinds of

6336.8 --> 6341.6
videos so that's probably the real one

6339.6 --> 6344.08
so yeah it's good thing a man like me

6341.6 --> 6346.4800000000005
that you did pop up

6344.08 --> 6350.28
because now i was able to

6346.48 --> 6350.28
remove that troll

6378.32 --> 6383.119
right but yeah that's right tara 306

6381.199 --> 6385.5199999999995
yeah the clone move is the one of the

6383.119 --> 6389.199
worst troll moves i know

6385.52 --> 6391.6
that is partially a reason why

6389.199 --> 6394.239
i give you guys wrenches

6391.6 --> 6397.4400000000005
remember that's kind of the original

6394.239 --> 6398.5599999999995
reason why i started doing that

6397.44 --> 6400.719
because

6398.56 --> 6402.2390000000005
like my chat was getting swarmed by

6400.719 --> 6404.639
people that were just

6402.239 --> 6407.199
making sock accounts of other people and

6404.639 --> 6408.8
then nagging me it was really confusing

6407.199 --> 6411.599999999999
at the start

6408.8 --> 6414.4800000000005
like during the early bird

6411.6 --> 6416.2390000000005
like first 500 there was a lot of issues

6414.48 --> 6418.48
with that and that's really the reason

6416.239 --> 6421.919999999999
why i started handing out wrenches so

6418.48 --> 6425.5199999999995
that the wrench is like your id pass

6421.92 --> 6425.52
so i actually know it's you

6425.76 --> 6430.77
hmm

6427.65 --> 6430.7699999999995
[Music]

6430.88 --> 6434.28
yeah that's right

6435.54 --> 6439.239
[Music]

6451.119 --> 6454.44
that's right

6465.44 --> 6471.919999999999
yeah use it wisely though there's very

6467.44 --> 6472.96
specific uh wrench rules

6471.92 --> 6474.639
so

6472.96 --> 6478.4800000000005
like i do recommend if you hadn't

6474.639 --> 6479.92
already to read the live chat rules

6478.48 --> 6483.119
because

6479.92 --> 6486.2390000000005
don't just like go smacking people with

6483.119 --> 6488.0
the wrench all that easily is very

6486.239 --> 6488.799999999999
because it can be very disruptive you

6488.0 --> 6491.119
see

6488.8 --> 6493.360000000001
so i really

6491.119 --> 6496.32
i really only want you guys with the

6493.36 --> 6497.28
rent just to ban people only if you're

6496.32 --> 6499.5199999999995
like

6497.28 --> 6502.08
very certain that they are

6499.52 --> 6503.92
just trolls trying to spam or something

6502.08 --> 6505.36
right because if it's somebody that

6503.92 --> 6506.68
happens to disagree with you

6505.36 --> 6508.08
philosophically

6506.68 --> 6510.159000000001
[Music]

6508.08 --> 6512.48
then just don't ban them that's gonna

6510.159 --> 6514.0
cause a giant mess

6512.48 --> 6516.74
right good

6514.0 --> 6523.6
excellent

6516.74 --> 6523.599999999999

6527.52 --> 6530.080000000001

6531.28 --> 6535.04
that's right yeah man like me has been

6532.88 --> 6538.159000000001
around for like

6535.04 --> 6538.159
four or five years

6538.48 --> 6541.839999999999
in the flatter scene

6549.36 --> 6554.0
right but yeah the chat rules and all

6551.28 --> 6554.88
that have updated in like the last two

6554.0 --> 6556.639
year

6554.88 --> 6558.8
pretty significantly

6556.639 --> 6561.599
so it's always good to

6558.8 --> 6561.599
remind people

6563.199 --> 6566.199
um

6591.28 --> 6597.679

6605.36 --> 6611.839999999999
matthew holt

6607.44 --> 6611.839999999999
why for not having to hear the trolls

6623.04 --> 6628.32
24th discord chat which yet

6626.719 --> 6631.28
you mean the youtube chat because they

6628.32 --> 6634.719
disabled the youtube chat entirely there

6631.28 --> 6634.719
i only like the discord

6636.84 --> 6641.76
chat i don't really go there anymore by

6639.44 --> 6641.759999999999

6679.84 --> 6684.4800000000005
like really scary

i mean what kind of a mind control

6684.48 --> 6689.638999999999

cool

6754.32 --> 6757.96
i got some likes

6773.28 --> 6777.36
a little bit confusing how it's all

6774.96 --> 6780.639
supposed to work on twitter though but i

6777.36 --> 6780.639
don't know i'll get used to it

6781.44 --> 6787.709
anyway

6790.4 --> 6795.28
okay elise g

6792.719 --> 6795.28
what the

6800.96 --> 6806.08
so i just found twitter no i didn't just

6803.84 --> 6808.88
find it i just kind of decided like

6806.08 --> 6810.48
maybe i should

6808.88 --> 6812.639
like

6810.48 --> 6816.159
spread around a bit you see i've been

6812.639 --> 6817.52
like trying to actively avoid that for

6816.159 --> 6820.839999999999
well

6817.52 --> 6820.84
six years

6822.56 --> 6826.159000000001
you know

6823.76 --> 6828.2390000000005
i've been like no i don't want to be on

6826.159 --> 6830.32
every freaking social media i didn't

6828.239 --> 6831.759999999999
want it i wanted to just focus on

6830.32 --> 6834.08
youtube

6831.76 --> 6836.719
but

6834.08 --> 6836.719
i think that

6836.88 --> 6841.04
yeah

6838.4 --> 6843.759999999999
maybe twitter as like a sort of an

6841.04 --> 6846.32
advertisement arm

6843.76 --> 6848.4800000000005
for my youtube activities could work

6846.32 --> 6849.5
and besides now i can also just look

6848.48 --> 6850.718999999999
around on twitter

6849.5 --> 6853.36
[Music]

6850.719 --> 6854.32
and like randomly blabber about things

6853.36 --> 6857.36
and

6854.32 --> 6859.119
respond to dutch things and all that

6857.36 --> 6862.719
get myself a little bit more on the map

6859.119 --> 6865.44
because youtube's not exactly helping me

6862.719 --> 6866.4
putting me on the map everywhere so

6865.44 --> 6869.44
twitter

6866.4 --> 6871.5199999999995
can be now a way that i could do that

6869.44 --> 6872.96
as long as i don't get deleted right

6871.52 --> 6875.1990000000005
that's kind of my biggest worry that

6872.96 --> 6877.44
they'll be like oh this arwen is like

6875.199 --> 6880.96
crazy or

6877.44 --> 6880.96
or he's evil or something

6881.199 --> 6884.5599999999995
i don't know

6882.4 --> 6887.598999999999
so i'm just gonna try it out on twitter

6884.56 --> 6889.119000000001
and see how far it goes and maybe it'll

6887.599 --> 6891.1990000000005
stay

6889.119 --> 6893.5199999999995
or maybe he'll get banned

6891.199 --> 6895.5199999999995
i mean i talk about a lot of subjects

6893.52 --> 6898.320000000001
that are kind of on the no-no list i

6895.52 --> 6899.679
just don't make entire videos dedicated

6898.32 --> 6902.48
to it

6899.679 --> 6904.96
right i don't do that i just talk about

6902.48 --> 6907.839999999999
everything that's what i do it's kind of

6904.96 --> 6910.639
helped me out so far with youtube for

6907.84 --> 6912.32
not getting banned

6910.639 --> 6916.52
and maybe that's good enough for twitter

6912.32 --> 6916.5199999999995
as well so we'll see

6920.159 --> 6923.598999999999
yeah bobby steals i don't give a [ __ ]

6922.08 --> 6925.76
i'm not gonna even read the rules i'm

6923.599 --> 6928.08
just gonna do what i do

6925.76 --> 6930.8
and do it the way that works

6928.08 --> 6932.8
that's been working so far yeah

6930.8 --> 6935.92
do you think that i like know all the

6932.8 --> 6935.92
rules for youtube

6936.56 --> 6939.52
no

6937.76 --> 6940.719
nathan knows them

6939.52 --> 6943.040000000001
i don't

6940.719 --> 6945.36
and i don't give a [ __ ]

6943.04 --> 6948.32
well i do give a [ __ ] a little

6945.36 --> 6951.36
but not enough to like oh i gotta do

6948.32 --> 6953.92
exactly the [ __ ] that i'll be good

6951.36 --> 6955.5199999999995
enough right i'll be good enough not to

6953.92 --> 6957.599
like be right

6955.52 --> 6960.080000000001
i'm gonna say the thing i'm not supposed

6957.599 --> 6963.119000000001
to say and make a special video only

6960.08 --> 6966.639
about that and let it go viral because

6963.119 --> 6969.92
that's how you get banned

6966.639 --> 6973.679
right that's not what i do

6969.92 --> 6975.36
i just talk about everything in between

6973.679 --> 6977.36
the rest

6975.36 --> 6979.92
and that seems to be working out just

6977.36 --> 6981.44
fine i mean how many times

6979.92 --> 6984.639
have i talked

6981.44 --> 6987.36
like have i spoken with like very

6984.639 --> 6989.1990000000005
alternative opinions about very heavy

6987.36 --> 6990.5599999999995
subjects

6989.199 --> 6992.799999999999
a lot

6990.56 --> 6994.719
i've talked about it a lot it seems to

6992.8 --> 6996.56
be working just fine i'm not getting a

6994.719 --> 6998.88
strike every week

6996.56 --> 6998.88
right

6999.28 --> 7004.5599999999995
so

7000.96 --> 7004.56
that seems to be working just fine

7004.71 --> 7007.77
[Music]

7012.4 --> 7017.679
oh no what gets you bad because other

7015.04 --> 7019.04
people get banned

7017.679 --> 7021.119
yeah i don't

7019.04 --> 7023.199
i don't even trust the rules like that

7021.119 --> 7025.36
the rules are not the reason why people

7023.199 --> 7028.4
get banned the reason why people get

7025.36 --> 7031.119
banned is because they are playing

7028.4 --> 7033.36
against the big magic trick of the mega

7031.119 --> 7035.5199999999995
corporations and governments in the time

7033.36 --> 7037.598999999999
that the spell is rolling out that's how

7035.52 --> 7039.84
you get back because you just

7037.599 --> 7042.400000000001
had to talk about the thing that's

7039.84 --> 7045.1990000000005
happening right now you had to talk

7042.4 --> 7046.799999999999
about it i have to go viral that's how

7045.199 --> 7049.28
you get that

7046.8 --> 7052.159000000001
that is how it works not some [ __ ]

7049.28 --> 7054.32
rules on some page it's nothing to do

7052.159 --> 7056.159
with that at all

7054.32 --> 7057.28
it's only about
