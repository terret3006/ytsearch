88.799 --> 95.68
it's kind of misty gray soup

92.24 --> 98.83999999999999
there's a lot of moist in the air

95.68 --> 100.88000000000001
huh just put some bread out on the roof

98.84 --> 102.64
there

100.88 --> 104.64
and they're all scrambling to basically

102.64 --> 109.04
pick some up and then fly away

104.64 --> 111.84
quickly although

109.04 --> 112.159
only the jackdaws has ah and the magpie

111.84 --> 115.84
there

112.159 --> 115.84
seemed to discovered it

116.159 --> 119.60000000000001
quickly pick something up quickly

118.079 --> 124.079
quickly and then

119.6 --> 124.079
fly more more and it's more of course

124.24 --> 129.84
and then quickly fly away

140.319 --> 146.39999999999998
so it's not that cold but it is really

143.52 --> 146.4
moist outside

146.56 --> 153.04
uh so i got

149.599 --> 153.04
green tea with me and

154.0 --> 157.44
very ripe banana small one

156.13 --> 161.44
[Music]

157.44 --> 163.35999999999999
an apple and an orange i don't know

161.44 --> 164.8
i was kind of putting gonna put them in

163.36 --> 168.31900000000002
a yogurt but i

164.8 --> 171.519
i don't really feel like yogurt anymore

168.319 --> 173.28
i don't know maybe if i still take it

171.519 --> 174.959
but i didn't get i don't have any

173.28 --> 177.44
breadish

174.959 --> 179.84
like breakfast at the moment so this is

177.44 --> 182.48
going to be my breakfast

179.84 --> 185.44
right so let's see who's in chat here we

182.48 --> 188.56
go again was first

185.44 --> 193.28
michael jones at ramistan stone

188.56 --> 199.84
good to see you saturday 12th

193.28 --> 199.84
december 2020

202.56 --> 213.84
i feel pretty good i got up

206.0 --> 213.84
before 12.

214.159 --> 218.959
a really good night rest not too late

219.04 --> 225.35999999999999
so yeah and again

222.56 --> 227.44
today just realized again like what what

225.36 --> 228.31900000000002
this is like now just not drinking at

227.44 --> 230.4
all

228.319 --> 231.51899999999998
and it's kind of funny even because way

230.4 --> 233.519
before

231.519 --> 235.519
i started like drinking beers again on a

233.519 --> 237.84
regular basis

235.519 --> 238.959
like i didn't even think it was that big

237.84 --> 241.439
a deal

238.959 --> 242.56
but now that i'm basically completely

241.439 --> 244.56
off it again

242.56 --> 246.0
for almost a month i think i don't

244.56 --> 247.28
remember it doesn't really matter

246.0 --> 248.799
anymore because i just don't want to

247.28 --> 252.159
drink

248.799 --> 254.08
and i've had that before it was new like

252.159 --> 257.199
i'm never going to get that addicted

254.08 --> 259.44
it's just too many downsides to

257.199 --> 261.68
a lot of alcohol like really oh i want

259.44 --> 264.479
that rush i want that rush no no no no

261.68 --> 265.28000000000003
that doesn't work at all with me so it's

264.479 --> 268.24
always gonna be

265.28 --> 268.79999999999995
if i drink during the during a specific

268.24 --> 272.0
time in

268.8 --> 273.919
day until

272.0 --> 275.759
yeah until i've had enough and then i

273.919 --> 276.08
drop it for the day and that's how i do

275.759 --> 279.759
it

276.08 --> 282.71999999999997
and that way survive it until i

279.759 --> 285.04
stop following that principle during too

282.72 --> 287.36
much and then don't eat for a week

285.04 --> 289.52000000000004
right so i basically just thought not

287.36 --> 292.639
screw this

289.52 --> 295.75899999999996
i was kind of gonna stop anyway

292.639 --> 297.52
and hey it seems like well

295.759 --> 300.08000000000004
in the yeah in the mornings it's just

297.52 --> 302.24
very different

300.08 --> 302.24
like

305.6 --> 310.24
i did yeah it's not like i oh i don't

308.08 --> 313.039
feel a hangover anymore no no not like

310.24 --> 316.56
that it's just that my

313.039 --> 320.24
my intestines and just

316.56 --> 322.08
the organs they're just more rested

320.24 --> 325.12
that's what i'm really noticing like

322.08 --> 327.68
whoa i'm doing really good

325.12 --> 330.88
like i barely have any problems or

327.68 --> 330.88
little problems anymore

331.44 --> 339.84
yeah yeah we can hear you

342.08 --> 346.15999999999997
yeah i don't give them bread too much

344.8 --> 348.479
anymore

346.16 --> 349.6
because my diets changed and basically i

348.479 --> 353.199
always had spare

349.6 --> 355.199
leftover bread of a certain type

353.199 --> 357.28000000000003
that i would eat with my eggs and all

355.199 --> 359.44
that i don't eat eggs anymore well i am

357.28 --> 361.44
going to try to eat them again

359.44 --> 363.199
because it is a good source of protein

361.44 --> 365.12
but i just kind of stopped doing it i

363.199 --> 367.039
didn't like it anymore i don't know why

365.12 --> 370.479
it's weird

367.039 --> 370.479
that all changes suddenly

371.44 --> 376.24
but that yeah i haven't really given

372.96 --> 380.96
them a lot of breath so they're

376.24 --> 383.44
yeah they're probably feeling like ah

380.96 --> 386.15999999999997
the gravy's stopping i feel kind of

383.44 --> 386.16
guilty for that

388.4 --> 394.96
but yeah hey that's how it works

391.52 --> 396.15999999999997
no not trying to grabble them or

394.96 --> 398.31899999999996
anything but

396.16 --> 400.0
it was just free stuff i gave it they

398.319 --> 403.199
got it

400.0 --> 405.759
and now it's yeah it's out for now

403.199 --> 408.56
so that's just the way it's going to be

405.759 --> 410.16
didn't mean to gravel them but i kind of

408.56 --> 412.0
knew about it you know

410.16 --> 415.52000000000004
i knew that lesson before it's just that

412.0 --> 417.36
i really like feeding birds

415.52 --> 419.84
but i know it's like if you just give

417.36 --> 422.40000000000003
them everything they need then they stop

419.84 --> 425.039
learning to gather it themselves so you

422.4 --> 428.31899999999996
got to be careful with that too

425.039 --> 430.56
right anyway hey robin stanley good to

428.319 --> 435.199
see you

430.56 --> 438.72
made plenty of notes did i not too

435.199 --> 443.52000000000004
extended anyway yeah the flatter

438.72 --> 445.44000000000005
early bird yesterday it was good

443.52 --> 446.79999999999995
and the flat earth debate was also it

445.44 --> 449.84
was very intense

446.8 --> 451.599
yesterday it was just a lot of people

449.84 --> 453.84
very eager to

451.599 --> 455.039
share their ideas everybody had like

453.84 --> 456.4
ideas popping up

455.039 --> 458.71999999999997
in their minds all over the place i

456.4 --> 460.479
could feel it it was very tough

458.72 --> 462.56
eventually i wanted to just get a point

460.479 --> 464.71999999999997
in without somebody rumpusing me because

462.56 --> 466.639
everybody was trying to jump in

464.72 --> 468.16
not because they all really don't want

466.639 --> 468.919
to hear it but because they were just

468.16 --> 471.759
like

468.919 --> 473.44
spouting out energy so they couldn't

471.759 --> 475.28000000000003
handle themselves that happens sometimes

473.44 --> 477.12
it's kind of funny anyway

475.28 --> 479.44
but i tend to get annoyed when that

477.12 --> 481.12
happens because it just drives me nuts

479.44 --> 484.96
when everybody's like that

481.12 --> 488.479
very sensitive to that but i got my

484.96 --> 491.599
relative density situation with the

488.479 --> 494.0
helium balloon in the vomit comet

491.599 --> 495.84
in detail like right before nathan

494.0 --> 498.319
rounded out the live show

495.84 --> 500.31899999999996
and then that continued on pretty much

498.319 --> 501.599
in the after show which was just a giant

500.319 --> 504.72
waterfall of gravy

501.599 --> 507.36
like seriously just

504.72 --> 509.91900000000004
kept on going and going and going very

507.36 --> 513.039
intense after show very

509.919 --> 515.279
lively so we'll see that on sunday i

513.039 --> 515.279
think

519.599 --> 523.36
right own benjamin was also alive

524.64 --> 528.0
it's all about the fractals and some

527.04 --> 530.0
other stuff

528.0 --> 532.16
they had two different streams first he

530.0 --> 533.92
restreamed something and then

532.16 --> 535.8389999999999
i didn't really pay too much attention

533.92 --> 540.3199999999999
didn't last that long

535.839 --> 540.32
and then went live again somewhere later

540.56 --> 543.8389999999999
but yeah i was kind of all over the

542.24 --> 546.0
place also kind of

543.839 --> 548.5600000000001
took a look over at jaren's for a bit

546.0 --> 551.92
just to see like what is he doing now

548.56 --> 554.64
and they will have this elaborate

551.92 --> 556.8
kind of tough discussion about the bible

554.64 --> 559.1999999999999
that i know it's gonna be

556.8 --> 561.04
like i i had points where i thought like

559.2 --> 564.24
i don't like this

561.04 --> 567.5999999999999
but i get it they've done that before

564.24 --> 567.6
it's sort of their thing

568.48 --> 572.9590000000001
and they've there were some interesting

572.32 --> 575.7600000000001
points and

572.959 --> 576.0
especially again again it stood out to

575.76 --> 579.76
me

576.0 --> 584.399
which it gets it like that guy

579.76 --> 584.399
is very sharp like

584.48 --> 588.8000000000001
yeah let's just get a little weird here

586.88 --> 590.56
look personal kind i find his voice kind

588.8 --> 594.0
of annoying sorry dude

590.56 --> 595.5189999999999
it's not your fault but you are a sharp

594.0 --> 598.32
[ __ ]

595.519 --> 599.279
you are and you're and you got logos

598.32 --> 600.8000000000001
like you get it

599.279 --> 602.48
it's funny that you have get it in your

600.8 --> 603.5999999999999
name because i think this guy really

602.48 --> 606.9590000000001
does get it

603.6 --> 608.88
and he's very diplomatic

606.959 --> 610.0
just i've just found more and more

608.88 --> 614.0
respect over time

610.0 --> 615.12
for this guy and yeah it's interesting

614.0 --> 618.0
it's good to see

615.12 --> 619.04
there's somebody out there you know like

618.0 --> 622.88
that

619.04 --> 624.88
so and the rest it wasn't all that bad

622.88 --> 628.0
a couple of rumpus situation that was

624.88 --> 631.4399999999999
weird nobody really addressed that

628.0 --> 633.2
but yeah i did manage to kind of listen

631.44 --> 635.12
to it like half an hour

633.2 --> 636.8000000000001
they were talking about it historical

635.12 --> 638.5600000000001
reference and whitson gets it like

636.8 --> 640.24
really made some good points like he

638.56 --> 641.8389999999999
approached it from the atheist

640.24 --> 644.24
researcher perspective

641.839 --> 646.6400000000001
looking into them and it's all very just

644.24 --> 650.16
very smart thing to do

646.64 --> 652.3199999999999
like i did not personally do extensive

650.16 --> 653.8389999999999
research like he probably has really

652.32 --> 656.48
digging into the material

653.839 --> 659.44
but on a superficial level that is what

656.48 --> 661.9200000000001
i did with it as well

659.44 --> 663.6800000000001
when i was very young just in my mind i

661.92 --> 666.0
would just the way that i would ask

663.68 --> 667.8389999999999
people questions and stuff

666.0 --> 669.6
i was like i really want to dig i want

667.839 --> 671.839
to really figure this out so if i'm

669.6 --> 675.0400000000001
going to be biased about it then

671.839 --> 678.48
other biased people they will just

675.04 --> 679.8389999999999
reaffirm their beliefs and that's like a

678.48 --> 682.9590000000001
risk for the

679.839 --> 683.839
empiricism of like the research and i

682.959 --> 688.0
really yeah

683.839 --> 689.6800000000001
i respect that because he is

688.0 --> 691.76
like by his actions and by his

689.68 --> 694.64
principles and by his attitude he is

691.76 --> 695.92
definitely with logos i can feel it i

694.64 --> 697.04
can feel it now even though it's

695.92 --> 698.959
annoying voice

697.04 --> 700.3199999999999
but hey some people think i have an

698.959 --> 703.8389999999999
annoying voice

700.32 --> 704.88
i do my best to kind of make it more

703.839 --> 707.9200000000001
interesting i guess

704.88 --> 708.399
i have a i have a good spectrum in my

707.92 --> 711.4399999999999
voice

708.399 --> 713.04
i don't think i'm much of a singer but

711.44 --> 715.12
but i'm lucky like that that's just

713.04 --> 718.24
lucky that's my inheritance

715.12 --> 720.48
you know it's not something that oh oh

718.24 --> 722.16
i'm so special because i have a

720.48 --> 725.44
better voice than what it gets or

722.16 --> 728.399
something no no no no no

725.44 --> 728.639
not saying like that but i am very kind

728.399 --> 730.959
of

728.639 --> 732.16
because of the way i am i do typically

730.959 --> 734.8
get kind of like

732.16 --> 735.76
agitated about little things maybe maybe

734.8 --> 737.92
it's like

735.76 --> 739.76
autistic spectrum thing or something

737.92 --> 740.16
there is like in the distance some of

739.76 --> 743.279
that

740.16 --> 745.4399999999999
i do come from that sort of you know i

743.279 --> 748.48
explained it about my past

745.44 --> 751.36
but yeah

748.48 --> 752.9590000000001
somebody is like really awesome besides

751.36 --> 753.76
an annoying linger thing then i can

752.959 --> 756.4799999999999
basically

753.76 --> 758.0
not get i'll just look past it because

756.48 --> 760.8000000000001
it's just worth it

758.0 --> 760.8
that's how we see it

761.76 --> 768.48
you have pets no i don't nope

765.76 --> 770.3199999999999
i yeah these are just the birds in the

768.48 --> 773.44
area

770.32 --> 775.0400000000001
and there is a cat a neighbor cat but

773.44 --> 776.1600000000001
it's not really mine i haven't seen it

775.04 --> 779.279
in a while

776.16 --> 781.04
hope it's okay who does come by

779.279 --> 781.519
sometimes but i don't have a pet of my

781.04 --> 784.16
own

781.519 --> 787.839
at the moment there's not really any

784.16 --> 787.8389999999999
room for it here

789.44 --> 794.72
and there's people here allergic to cats

792.56 --> 797.1999999999999
because if i take a pet i take cat

794.72 --> 797.2
definitely

797.279 --> 801.8389999999999
i miss my old cats

803.279 --> 808.72
right let's see what you guys are

804.399 --> 808.72
talking about drunkenbullet411 is here

812.839 --> 819.2
too

814.24 --> 819.2
soul lines wet i don't know what that is

819.839 --> 828.1600000000001
nice bunch of regulars here no one too

822.56 --> 830.2399999999999
crazy huh

828.16 --> 831.279
right well that's because all the friday

830.24 --> 834.5600000000001
night people

831.279 --> 835.68
in the u.s are all just slipping off

834.56 --> 839.279
their

835.68 --> 841.4399999999999
alcohol and [ __ ] so yeah

839.279 --> 842.639
all the reggie squirters are all passed

841.44 --> 844.8800000000001
out

842.639 --> 844.88
uh

846.24 --> 850.399
yeah by the way before this morning i

848.56 --> 853.199
watched a really interesting video it

850.399 --> 858.639
was really interesting from john d

853.199 --> 862.079
narrated by karen b very impressive

858.639 --> 864.5600000000001
about the present ended model of energy

862.079 --> 866.16
and they made some really in my opinion

864.56 --> 868.0
good points now there might be people

866.16 --> 870.88
that disagree with it

868.0 --> 872.56
but they got the scientific method right

870.88 --> 874.88
to the letter

872.56 --> 876.7199999999999
and they just basically just put down

874.88 --> 880.16
some history

876.72 --> 882.24
about physics and energy and how that

880.16 --> 882.88
worked and they used this specific old

882.24 --> 888.16
model was

882.88 --> 891.519
the florin what's it called again

888.16 --> 894.16
the yeah the florid

891.519 --> 896.079
the florist stone theory and i heard of

894.16 --> 897.6
that before i learned that in school so

896.079 --> 900.88
it was like hey the fluorescent

897.6 --> 903.839
oh that's funny hearing that again and

900.88 --> 903.8389999999999
very good stuff

904.959 --> 908.399
and presented in a very good way so i'm

906.8 --> 911.04
going to share that link

908.399 --> 912.399
i ramistan already watched it it's a

911.04 --> 918.399
very good video

912.399 --> 918.399
on john d's channel narrated by karen b

920.48 --> 924.16
so check that out at some point

924.56 --> 928.4799999999999
it's 32 minutes

931.92 --> 934.24
right

937.43 --> 940.8
[Music]

938.959 --> 942.8
yeah and safe to say subscribe to his

940.8 --> 944.24
channel especially because this is part

942.8 --> 947.279
one

944.24 --> 951.12
and there's bound to be more of these so

947.279 --> 951.12
i'm definitely i'm subscribed

952.0 --> 955.36
i'm very curious to see the next couple

954.8 --> 958.24
of

955.36 --> 959.12
segments because they're very like

958.24 --> 962.72
really

959.12 --> 965.12
good like

962.72 --> 967.0400000000001
academic level presentations i really

965.12 --> 969.199
liked it

967.04 --> 971.68
and karen b is a great narrator and she

969.199 --> 971.68
knows that

973.36 --> 978.24
right anyway uh i watched that this

976.639 --> 983.839
morning

978.24 --> 983.839
what's it called again

987.199 --> 991.92
energy right it's really confusing too

991.199 --> 994.7199999999999
because i

991.92 --> 996.079
use the terminology of energy but i

994.72 --> 999.0400000000001
always do it to point

996.079 --> 1000.399
out the virtual structure really of the

999.04 --> 1001.5999999999999
chain of events and all that and all

1000.399 --> 1004.16
that see

1001.6 --> 1005.9200000000001
because when you get technical i i don't

1004.16 --> 1008.48
really do that

1005.92 --> 1010.16
you could like calculate translate it

1008.48 --> 1012.0790000000001
into energy there's like formulas for

1010.16 --> 1012.88
this in physics and i remember dealing

1012.079 --> 1016.4799999999999
with that

1012.88 --> 1018.079
constantly but yeah so it can kind of

1016.48 --> 1019.519
work out that's the funny thing but like

1018.079 --> 1025.839
what is it literally

1019.519 --> 1025.839
you know that's where things get weird

1026.319 --> 1030.959
there is an open challenge to bring on

1028.48 --> 1034.319
fed at the end yeah yeah

1030.959 --> 1038.0
yeah that yeah that was awesome like

1034.319 --> 1041.6789999999999
dude great great shout out to

1038.0 --> 1045.28
nathan oakley and it's i'm hoping to see

1041.679 --> 1048.4
that maybe people will get on there

1045.28 --> 1050.32
start talking about this if if that is

1048.4 --> 1051.44
i don't know if nathan it preach

1050.32 --> 1052.72
appreciates that

1051.44 --> 1055.039
otherwise they'll at least be able to

1052.72 --> 1056.24
like say yeah yeah i want to discuss

1055.039 --> 1059.36
this and then

1056.24 --> 1067.84
contact that way

1059.36 --> 1067.84
anyway uh

1069.039 --> 1073.52
all right i also probably i want to

1072.0 --> 1076.799
address it

1073.52 --> 1080.32
i want to apologize to

1076.799 --> 1082.4
anthony reilly sleeping warrior for

1080.32 --> 1084.32
like he really wanted to come on my show

1082.4 --> 1087.1200000000001
apparently

1084.32 --> 1088.3999999999999
and for two days in a row any kind of

1087.12 --> 1090.8799999999999
yeah i kind of like

1088.4 --> 1092.799
shoved him to the side said like no i

1090.88 --> 1095.5200000000002
just want to do my stream

1092.799 --> 1097.12
but apparently yeah he's really

1095.52 --> 1099.36
disappointed and then

1097.12 --> 1101.039
in chat he yeah we had a little weird

1099.36 --> 1104.8799999999999
bump in

1101.039 --> 1106.32
the early bird chat eventually he left

1104.88 --> 1108.64
it's not the first time by the way

1106.32 --> 1110.24
it's like the fourth time because

1108.64 --> 1112.16
sometimes that happens but yeah i

1110.24 --> 1114.32
basically shared

1112.16 --> 1116.48
a piece of text like we were talking and

1114.32 --> 1118.1599999999999
he just kind of like photographed it and

1116.48 --> 1119.919
send it to somebody else that i don't

1118.16 --> 1123.039
know about

1119.919 --> 1125.679
and it felt like a complete dick because

1123.039 --> 1126.96
i was basically just blabbering

1125.679 --> 1129.679
you know like the guys i wasn't

1126.96 --> 1131.2
expecting him to just show that rod to

1129.679 --> 1134.3200000000002
somebody else that i don't know

1131.2 --> 1136.32
and i got really pissed off but i still

1134.32 --> 1139.52
want to apologize

1136.32 --> 1139.52
hope he's not really

1140.72 --> 1146.96
annoyed probably not but i was

1144.48 --> 1148.88
you know i don't appreciate it if peop

1146.96 --> 1150.88
people just

1148.88 --> 1152.4
photograph like private skype

1150.88 --> 1155.44
conversations or whatever or

1152.4 --> 1157.3600000000001
who knows yeah record calls

1155.44 --> 1159.1200000000001
and then freaking share that with other

1157.36 --> 1161.36
people and all that [ __ ]

1159.12 --> 1163.28
that's just well this is just a minor

1161.36 --> 1165.6789999999999
thing and now he didn't mean any bad by

1163.28 --> 1167.6789999999999
it it's just sloppy and i don't like it

1165.679 --> 1168.96
especially at this point after

1167.679 --> 1170.72
everything that's happened now he

1168.96 --> 1171.3600000000001
doesn't probably know about it because

1170.72 --> 1172.96
i'm not

1171.36 --> 1174.799
just blabbering on about that

1172.96 --> 1176.48
specifically because it's annoying

1174.799 --> 1178.32
and i kind of want to forget about it

1176.48 --> 1181.44
get over it

1178.32 --> 1184.8799999999999
you know it's just but

1181.44 --> 1186.799
anyway cause the bump in

1184.88 --> 1189.7600000000002
and hope he's doing all right and i want

1186.799 --> 1189.76
to get him on the show

1190.08 --> 1193.12
you've been recorded too it's violating

1191.84 --> 1197.1999999999998
yeah robin stanley

1193.12 --> 1201.039
i get that now tony didn't do that

1197.2 --> 1201.039
so it's not the same it's just

1201.28 --> 1205.6
it just made a photograph of some text

1203.36 --> 1209.36
while i was basically talking about

1205.6 --> 1213.12
yeah he shared a video rap video

1209.36 --> 1214.8799999999999
some guy i don't know english guy

1213.12 --> 1217.76
and it was basically about the mask

1214.88 --> 1220.3200000000002
situation the corona and eugenics and

1217.76 --> 1220.799
it was pretty good but when i first saw

1220.32 --> 1225.039
it

1220.799 --> 1228.4
he like tony jokingly said

1225.039 --> 1230.08
like ah chocolate you got competition

1228.4 --> 1231.8400000000001
it's pure joke and i thought like yeah

1230.08 --> 1234.96
no way he's not a flattered

1231.84 --> 1237.84
i did i was just not receiving

1234.96 --> 1238.88
the jokey mood well i guess then that's

1237.84 --> 1242.8799999999999
my issue

1238.88 --> 1244.48
so it didn't start off well

1242.88 --> 1246.0
but then later i watched it it was a

1244.48 --> 1248.48
pretty good video

1246.0 --> 1249.44
but then yeah i already kind of like got

1248.48 --> 1251.28
bit like a dick

1249.44 --> 1252.96
i guess in the chat and he just freaking

1251.28 --> 1254.6399999999999
photographed that and sent that to that

1252.96 --> 1256.48
guy he's like dude

1254.64 --> 1259.919
that that makes me look like a total

1256.48 --> 1263.76
[ __ ] i wanted to correct myself

1259.919 --> 1266.0
it's just like the [ __ ] it's weird to do

1263.76 --> 1266.0
that

1267.12 --> 1273.28
right anyway it's

1270.32 --> 1273.76
it's not by a long shot the same as just

1273.28 --> 1276.0
yeah

1273.76 --> 1277.919
going on a private call with video and

1276.0 --> 1280.72
all and then just recording it without

1277.919 --> 1283.2800000000002
saying you know that's really is

1280.72 --> 1283.28
that's bad

1286.88 --> 1290.159
right robin's down yeah i respect him

1288.799 --> 1294.4
too but just

1290.159 --> 1294.4
little things sometimes it's annoying

1296.96 --> 1301.3600000000001
but there's no nefarious intent i'm

1298.88 --> 1303.679
pretty sure of that

1301.36 --> 1305.28
i'm not what i said not pretty sure i'm

1303.679 --> 1308.24
absolutely certain there was no

1305.28 --> 1308.24
nefarious intent

1309.76 --> 1314.08
yeah he does enjoy fight sometimes a

1312.159 --> 1316.3200000000002
little bit too much

1314.08 --> 1317.1999999999998
it can get really pokey sometimes just

1316.32 --> 1319.6789999999999
like

1317.2 --> 1321.3600000000001
come at me come at me like against us

1319.679 --> 1325.3600000000001
against me and like ah dude

1321.36 --> 1328.08
just like this young dog that just

1325.36 --> 1328.799
i want to do whatever bouncy bouncy when

1328.08 --> 1331.4399999999998
it's like ah

1328.799 --> 1334.4
just stop it already just go running

1331.44 --> 1334.4
outside or something

1336.64 --> 1347.8400000000001
but that's tony anthony riley

1340.559 --> 1347.84
right but he's a great guy

1348.159 --> 1354.4
very loyal guy so

1351.76 --> 1354.4
i like that

1358.84 --> 1364.08
anyway

1361.039 --> 1367.12
yeah if he if he shows up

1364.08 --> 1371.52
in skype all that i'll i'll get him

1367.12 --> 1371.52
on if he wants

1371.679 --> 1376.64
i don't know might be that he blocked me

1373.52 --> 1379.9189999999999
or something i don't know

1376.64 --> 1383.1200000000001
on skype because i pissed him off

1379.919 --> 1383.1200000000001
whatever we'll find out

1386.96 --> 1392.08
right so you guys gals want to talk

1389.36 --> 1392.08
about anything

1392.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
basically went through the list

1404.08 --> 1407.84
because i wasn't really watching

1406.24 --> 1413.2
anything

1407.84 --> 1413.1999999999998
yesterday just listening some music

1413.28 --> 1418.559
playing a game

1416.799 --> 1420.559
and i was chatting a lot with here we go

1418.559 --> 1424.72
again and in the chats

1420.559 --> 1428.48
flat earth debate all that

1424.72 --> 1428.48
rectangular looping oh dear

1428.84 --> 1431.84
okay

1439.84 --> 1444.559
i don't know i've been kind of like a

1442.08 --> 1446.559
little downer in the uh rectangular

1444.559 --> 1447.76
looping department because like every

1446.559 --> 1449.6
time i freaking

1447.76 --> 1452.08
bring it up everybody is always laughing

1449.6 --> 1454.7199999999998
at me it's really annoying

1452.08 --> 1454.72
like john

1455.279 --> 1458.96
wits it was even kind of laughing at me

1458.08 --> 1462.6399999999999
for it

1458.96 --> 1464.32
it's just like uh thanks

1462.64 --> 1466.96
i don't know anybody out there that's

1464.32 --> 1466.96
like really

1467.6 --> 1471.279
more of a championing person like really

1470.0 --> 1474.48
getting on

1471.279 --> 1476.4
out there live and all that i don't know

1474.48 --> 1477.3600000000001
anybody else besides myself that's

1476.4 --> 1480.4
actually doing that

1477.36 --> 1483.6789999999999
like there were some those people

1480.4 --> 1486.96
that made videos some time ago

1483.679 --> 1490.64
square earth cosmology for example but

1486.96 --> 1490.64
i've never seen his face before

1491.6 --> 1496.799
or heard his voice i don't know who that

1493.84 --> 1499.1999999999998
is and don't know anybody else

1496.799 --> 1501.12
it said that it's the pac-man mall

1499.2 --> 1502.799
people have talked about it i've never

1501.12 --> 1505.039
seen anybody

1502.799 --> 1507.12
really making making a good video about

1505.039 --> 1507.12
it

1509.2 --> 1517.279
huh magnetic transparency hi

1513.76 --> 1522.0
nathan thompson mentioned you two on

1517.279 --> 1522.0
d on what where

1526.32 --> 1531.12
yeah shout out to nathan thompson for

1528.88 --> 1534.0800000000002
not taking away my wrench

1531.12 --> 1534.799
gave me a a logical warning and i said

1534.08 --> 1542.84
yeah yeah

1534.799 --> 1546.0
don't worry about that

1542.84 --> 1556.79
[Music]

1546.0 --> 1561.76
but yeah he mentioned me okay about what

1556.79 --> 1563.6789999999999
[Music]

1561.76 --> 1565.12
all right you watched that kent hovind

1563.679 --> 1570.48
thing yeah that wasn't yesterday that

1565.12 --> 1574.08
was the day before

1570.48 --> 1574.08
right where i got in chat and all that

1579.039 --> 1583.679
yeah that was pretty funny like he was

1582.159 --> 1585.919
kind of like

1583.679 --> 1587.8400000000001
digging in the idea and i was like yeah

1585.919 --> 1589.5200000000002
yeah of course if you just bury a whale

1587.84 --> 1593.039
it just suddenly gets buried

1589.52 --> 1596.32
covered up whales just a lot of fat

1593.039 --> 1598.08
so that could turn into biofuel example

1596.32 --> 1598.8799999999999
like that was like okay that's sort of a

1598.08 --> 1601.1999999999998
plausible

1598.88 --> 1603.5200000000002
scenario because it's a whale it's just

1601.2 --> 1607.279
a lot of fat floating

1603.52 --> 1609.6
right but yeah

1607.279 --> 1611.44
like it was mixed like he brought forth

1609.6 --> 1612.7199999999998
some old arguments basically for the

1611.44 --> 1614.559
flood that were very good

1612.72 --> 1616.0
and then i agree with that like i really

1614.559 --> 1617.44
agree with that

1616.0 --> 1619.12
but then other times it would get a

1617.44 --> 1622.159
little weird and like oh

1619.12 --> 1623.4399999999998
start old dinosaurs being buried and oh

1622.159 --> 1627.8400000000001
god

1623.44 --> 1627.8400000000001
so it's like weird mixing of like

1628.64 --> 1633.1200000000001
it's a creationist but at the same time

1631.12 --> 1635.6789999999999
he does apparently believe in ancient

1633.12 --> 1638.84
dinosaurs now i i don't understand

1635.679 --> 1640.24
i don't really understand anymore it's

1638.84 --> 1642.799
weird

1640.24 --> 1644.559
i don't know what's going on but he got

1642.799 --> 1648.1589999999999
pretty nutty with the ball

1644.559 --> 1650.559
system and supposed magnetics

1648.159 --> 1652.3990000000001
of the molten iron core and try to

1650.559 --> 1653.9189999999999
explain in chat like yeah yeah curie

1652.399 --> 1656.2399999999998
temperature it's that's going to be a

1653.919 --> 1657.8400000000001
problem because

1656.24 --> 1659.36
molten iron is above the curie

1657.84 --> 1662.8799999999999
temperature it can't hold

1659.36 --> 1665.9189999999999
or create magnetics any longer so

1662.88 --> 1665.919
how does that work

1666.48 --> 1671.679
right anyway so

1669.919 --> 1673.2
i could talk about the rectangular

1671.679 --> 1677.44
looping what

1673.2 --> 1677.44
about it would you like me to address

1679.76 --> 1684.48
right yeah hovind is too sketchy for you

1682.559 --> 1689.12
yeah i get that

1684.48 --> 1689.1200000000001
in a way like yeah

1689.6 --> 1692.6399999999999
he is like this

1694.84 --> 1699.039
baller

1696.72 --> 1700.08
yeah his research and his work on

1699.039 --> 1703.52
creationism

1700.08 --> 1708.6399999999999
is pretty good like he has a lot of data

1703.52 --> 1710.96
in his in his story that is good

1708.64 --> 1711.679
but he also has like a lot of naughty

1710.96 --> 1714.159
baller

1711.679 --> 1714.159
ideas

1715.039 --> 1719.039
i don't know it's interesting it's kind

1717.52 --> 1721.12
of amusing

1719.039 --> 1723.12
because that way it's like okay spot the

1721.12 --> 1723.4399999999998
good things and point out the bad things

1723.12 --> 1727.4399999999998
i

1723.44 --> 1728.159
just yeah there's so many people now

1727.44 --> 1730.88
that

1728.159 --> 1731.279
just have that one way or the other and

1730.88 --> 1735.1200000000001
it's

1731.279 --> 1735.12
like i don't really mind that much

1736.84 --> 1739.84
anymore

1742.559 --> 1747.36
right okay rectangular looping you

1745.52 --> 1748.8799999999999
haven't heard the full explanation well

1747.36 --> 1752.559
there are some hangouts

1748.88 --> 1755.1200000000001
from way back from the

1752.559 --> 1756.24
flat earth talks day where i elaborately

1755.12 --> 1761.12
address

1756.24 --> 1762.64
the subject yeah several occasions

1761.12 --> 1765.279
the full works you can watch that most

1762.64 --> 1769.039
of that is pretty valid still

1765.279 --> 1772.72
because it is basically i it is modeling

1769.039 --> 1774.8799999999999
right so yeah immediately no science

1772.72 --> 1775.919
just forget about it's not scientific

1774.88 --> 1779.3600000000001
right

1775.919 --> 1781.1200000000001
but i have devised ways to falsify

1779.36 --> 1784.799
elements about it to basically

1781.12 --> 1788.399
say okay if this is the case

1784.799 --> 1792.1589999999999
then it's not looping and then hey

1788.399 --> 1795.4399999999998
if this is the case then

1792.159 --> 1798.88
there it's could be looping

1795.44 --> 1800.799
like how else do you explain it right

1798.88 --> 1802.3200000000002
that's basically what i was left with in

1800.799 --> 1805.679
the end but

1802.32 --> 1805.6789999999999
anyway let's let's see

1805.84 --> 1811.12
why i think that the earth might might

1808.24 --> 1814.32
be rectangular looping or

1811.12 --> 1818.7199999999998
square but it's complicated

1814.32 --> 1822.24
is because i am not too certain that the

1818.72 --> 1826.72
equator line

1822.24 --> 1829.039
is a geometrical literal circle

1826.72 --> 1830.48
over the flat earth right because that

1829.039 --> 1832.8799999999999
is what the disk model

1830.48 --> 1833.679
typically shows always like ooh and then

1832.88 --> 1836.0800000000002
immediately

1833.679 --> 1838.3990000000001
oh the magnetic sort of works and the

1836.08 --> 1839.039
sun and the moon can be triangulatable

1838.399 --> 1841.76
now

1839.039 --> 1842.8799999999999
in this model of the earth being a disk

1841.76 --> 1845.6
it's all very cute

1842.88 --> 1847.44
and so gets very close to getting that

1845.6 --> 1848.84
feeling back off yeah we got something

1847.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
solid

1848.84 --> 1854.08
right but it's a projection

1851.84 --> 1856.0
it's still a map projection it's based

1854.08 --> 1858.72
on a map projection

1856.0 --> 1861.44
and that's just weird oddities about it

1858.72 --> 1866.159
and uncertainties

1861.44 --> 1866.159
for example a hint that i got is that

1867.76 --> 1870.8799999999999
let's say if it's all geometrical

1869.76 --> 1874.8799999999999
literally a disk

1870.88 --> 1877.279
as is without any looping or spatial

1874.88 --> 1879.2
non-linearity going on maybe i'd have to

1877.279 --> 1882.559
address spatial non-linearity even

1879.2 --> 1886.0
before i get into the looping

1882.559 --> 1889.76
but anyway one of the early hints was

1886.0 --> 1892.559
that if antarctica is a giant

1889.76 --> 1894.399
wall of ice in a circle surrounding the

1892.559 --> 1897.96
realm

1894.399 --> 1901.12
then why when it was basically

1897.96 --> 1902.48
circumnavigated whatever people went

1901.12 --> 1906.32
past the wall

1902.48 --> 1908.3990000000001
then why does the length not add up

1906.32 --> 1909.6789999999999
to be able to literally contain the

1908.399 --> 1911.76
entire earth realm

1909.679 --> 1913.679
because it seems to be smaller it

1911.76 --> 1916.0
doesn't technically fit

1913.679 --> 1917.679
if you take the map projection as a

1916.0 --> 1921.12
literal

1917.679 --> 1923.3600000000001
spatially linear shape a representation

1921.12 --> 1925.12
of reality in a euclidean fashion

1923.36 --> 1927.1999999999998
it doesn't technically fit so you get

1925.12 --> 1928.6399999999999
the weird the first weird oddity about

1927.2 --> 1930.48
it

1928.64 --> 1932.0800000000002
and then there's like the mystery of the

1930.48 --> 1936.159
north like

1932.08 --> 1936.1589999999999
is there more space there somehow

1936.32 --> 1939.84
like or is it just really just that

1938.72 --> 1942.48
little thing

1939.84 --> 1944.08
and we're not allowed to go there but

1942.48 --> 1945.76
there's like miss there's even stories

1944.08 --> 1947.6
about like yeah you can go further to

1945.76 --> 1949.679
the north and then the mountain range in

1947.6 --> 1951.6
the rivers

1949.679 --> 1953.919
so is there something beyond there and

1951.6 --> 1956.559
then how would that fit

1953.919 --> 1958.5590000000002
how would that fit all of that it was

1956.559 --> 1961.44
said like recorded or said to be

1958.559 --> 1961.84
pretty huge land a huge mountain range

1961.44 --> 1965.44
very

1961.84 --> 1966.0
large how does that fit inside the

1965.44 --> 1969.279
center

1966.0 --> 1972.48
of a literal euclidean disk

1969.279 --> 1974.159
see so those are the first like clues

1972.48 --> 1976.64
that just say like yeah

1974.159 --> 1978.48
you don't know for certain it is a

1976.64 --> 1980.7990000000002
literal disc

1978.48 --> 1981.76
and then there's the question okay the

1980.799 --> 1984.799
equator

1981.76 --> 1988.08
line it is derived

1984.799 --> 1991.279
from the celestial orientation from how

1988.08 --> 1994.559
the positions of the sun are mostly

1991.279 --> 1997.6
right so when you take that

1994.559 --> 2000.8799999999999
virtual line you draw it out

1997.6 --> 2003.4399999999998
on the map and then you measure

2000.88 --> 2005.279
like literally is this going are we

2003.44 --> 2007.1200000000001
going slightly around the corner not

2005.279 --> 2008.72
looking at magnetics only at the

2007.12 --> 2013.279
celestial orientation

2008.72 --> 2013.279
magnetics are completely uninvolved

2013.36 --> 2018.0
right just go by the celestial

2015.919 --> 2021.76
orientation like is this equator line

2018.0 --> 2021.76
going to turn out to be some kind of a

2022.159 --> 2025.7600000000002
do you go around the corner right that's

2024.0 --> 2028.96
the first step

2025.76 --> 2033.2
so if you do how much

2028.96 --> 2036.8400000000001
how much degrees

2033.2 --> 2040.24
is the entire turn is it a

2036.84 --> 2041.9189999999999
360 degree turn now that would point

2040.24 --> 2044.24
that it is actually some kind of a

2041.919 --> 2049.52
circle but

2044.24 --> 2050.079
what if all right what if it's not a 360

2049.52 --> 2053.2
degree

2050.079 --> 2056.079
turn what do you do then

2053.2 --> 2057.1589999999997
when you end up at the same spot and you

2056.079 --> 2061.04
didn't turn

2057.159 --> 2064.2400000000002
360 degrees now that's freaky isn't it

2061.04 --> 2068.879
right then you got a

2064.24 --> 2068.879
irregular looping system with an arc

2069.599 --> 2073.44
how do you explain that if you think

2071.76 --> 2075.8390000000004
that the world

2073.44 --> 2076.96
is a literal disc how do you ex how do

2075.839 --> 2079.2799999999997
you justify that

2076.96 --> 2081.04
right this is a potential thing that

2079.28 --> 2082.32
could be the outcome i'm not saying it

2081.04 --> 2084.72
is like this

2082.32 --> 2086.3990000000003
it's a potentially it's a it's a

2084.72 --> 2089.52
possibility

2086.399 --> 2093.2
right well i could explain it

2089.52 --> 2096.639
and just say okay apparently the

2093.2 --> 2096.6389999999997
land is some sort of a

2097.52 --> 2104.24
incomplete disk and it's just cut

2100.88 --> 2107.28
it just connects so

2104.24 --> 2110.3199999999997
yeah if you would then want to wrap it

2107.28 --> 2112.0
it would be more like a cone but how do

2110.32 --> 2113.2000000000003
you explain that there's no curvature

2112.0 --> 2116.64
there's no weird

2113.2 --> 2119.5989999999997
situations with that it's all flat right

2116.64 --> 2121.44
because it is all flat so electro cone

2119.599 --> 2124.92
that doesn't make any sense

2121.44 --> 2127.839
but yet that's we didn't turn the

2124.92 --> 2129.359
360 degrees when we followed the equator

2127.839 --> 2132.88
how is that possible

2129.359 --> 2134.4
well maybe because the realm simply has

2132.88 --> 2137.599
a looping factor

2134.4 --> 2140.64
there might be a a

2137.599 --> 2142.88
piece of land that at certain points

2140.64 --> 2144.0
just loops in on itself like it

2142.88 --> 2147.28
literally connects

2144.0 --> 2150.359
and that connection is fluid

2147.28 --> 2152.96
because what would be the case spatial

2150.359 --> 2155.839
non-linearity so there's an

2152.96 --> 2155.839
interconnection

2157.2 --> 2160.3199999999997
and then yeah if you represent that in

2158.96 --> 2162.079
paper this is very

2160.32 --> 2164.0
typical then you wrap it around and look

2162.079 --> 2167.04
it's a cone but it's not

2164.0 --> 2170.079
a euclidean literal cone it just

2167.04 --> 2173.04
connects like a cone right

2170.079 --> 2175.3590000000004
now this is a not rectangular looping

2173.04 --> 2177.119
this is more like a

2175.359 --> 2179.2
well i got a drawing for it let me find

2177.119 --> 2187.839
it i'll show it

2179.2 --> 2187.839
i addressed this subject some time ago

2189.2 --> 2192.48
all right come on

2194.96 --> 2201.839
letter letters where is it

2199.119 --> 2201.839
there it is

2202.24 --> 2205.7599999999998
right okay let's see

2208.64 --> 2212.24
yeah that's the wrong one

2213.52 --> 2221.68
that's the wrong one too okay

2216.96 --> 2221.68
let's see no no no no

2226.64 --> 2234.3199999999997
let's see if i can get this

2230.24 --> 2237.68
yes all right

2234.32 --> 2241.04
so a way to represent that what i just

2237.68 --> 2241.04
described the cone

2241.119 --> 2244.4
the cone earth would be one segment of

2244.0 --> 2248.4
this

2244.4 --> 2251.599
now that leaves open another mystery

2248.4 --> 2253.44
mainly can you move further

2251.599 --> 2255.599
because if you get that then it things

2253.44 --> 2257.599
get really weird and loopy

2255.599 --> 2259.76
because there might be entire realm

2257.599 --> 2263.76
sections in a similar

2259.76 --> 2265.599
shape beyond that right

2263.76 --> 2267.92
but that's not the only possibility

2265.599 --> 2267.92
though

2268.96 --> 2276.0
because what if the earth

2272.56 --> 2279.119
was a flat globe yeah

2276.0 --> 2282.48
well then you get this

2279.119 --> 2284.8
now that's really weird because

2282.48 --> 2286.079
the land segments interconnect like a

2284.8 --> 2289.76
globe

2286.079 --> 2293.52
with this spatial interconnection

2289.76 --> 2294.32
like basically highly suggesting like

2293.52 --> 2297.04
you're

2294.32 --> 2297.76
moving over a globe but guess what it's

2297.04 --> 2299.2799999999997
flat

2297.76 --> 2300.8
it's freaking flat yeah what you're

2299.28 --> 2302.5600000000004
going to do about that it's flat there's

2300.8 --> 2304.2400000000002
no actual curvature

2302.56 --> 2306.16
but yeah what if the land just

2304.24 --> 2307.5989999999997
interconnects spatially

2306.16 --> 2309.68
as if it were a globe then you got a

2307.599 --> 2310.56
flat glow but even a flat globe could

2309.68 --> 2313.359
have another

2310.56 --> 2315.44
a tunnel connection at the north and

2313.359 --> 2317.68
potentially the south

2315.44 --> 2319.76
like a literal maybe like a little

2317.68 --> 2322.96
portal that just

2319.76 --> 2324.8
like a door opens up

2322.96 --> 2326.2400000000002
like it's at the center but when you

2324.8 --> 2328.5600000000004
step into the center

2326.24 --> 2331.9199999999996
you open up to another world that's

2328.56 --> 2335.52
literally right next to it

2331.92 --> 2338.88
right isn't that

2335.52 --> 2340.079
weird okay now let's move on to the next

2338.88 --> 2342.96
this is a different type of

2340.079 --> 2342.96
representation

2344.56 --> 2352.7999999999997
it could be that the earth

2348.16 --> 2352.7999999999997
is like a disk like ring

2353.599 --> 2360.32
so yeah this is what happens

2356.8 --> 2361.52
when the loop or sorry when the

2360.32 --> 2365.04
connection

2361.52 --> 2367.7599999999998
of the the uh of the equator line

2365.04 --> 2368.24
is actually 360 degrees because when it

2367.76 --> 2371.3590000000004
is

2368.24 --> 2372.0789999999997
it's not entirely over yet because even

2371.359 --> 2374.56
if it is

2372.079 --> 2375.8390000000004
a literal connecting circle it's like oh

2374.56 --> 2378.0
yes yes we got

2375.839 --> 2378.88
it's really a circle wow this is amazing

2378.0 --> 2382.0
it's really

2378.88 --> 2384.32
literally a circle right so what about

2382.0 --> 2386.56
the space inside and outside that

2384.32 --> 2390.2400000000002
lateral circle

2386.56 --> 2392.0
right what if yeah if at the north pole

2390.24 --> 2396.0
there is this giant amount of

2392.0 --> 2397.68
land and all that that doesn't fit

2396.0 --> 2399.119
so it's really cute that you got a

2397.68 --> 2401.359
literal circle

2399.119 --> 2403.839
but yeah there's still there's too much

2401.359 --> 2407.2799999999997
inside of that circle to geometrically

2403.839 --> 2410.24
fit right you got a problem and maybe

2407.28 --> 2413.3590000000004
on the outside south of the equator when

2410.24 --> 2416.72
you put that together

2413.359 --> 2419.2
well it might not technically really fit

2416.72 --> 2422.3999999999996
in a outside of the literal circle as i

2419.2 --> 2424.8799999999997
said remember with the south pole

2422.4 --> 2426.7200000000003
the supposed eyes well surrounding us

2424.88 --> 2428.48
like it geometrically it doesn't really

2426.72 --> 2430.319
technically fit it's too short

2428.48 --> 2432.4
right so there's that issue that fits in

2430.319 --> 2434.319
this model too if the equator line is a

2432.4 --> 2437.76
literal circle

2434.319 --> 2438.48
but this shows this specific model

2437.76 --> 2441.92
conception

2438.48 --> 2443.92
shows a kind of a warpy system that's

2441.92 --> 2447.52
really surreal and that is that what if

2443.92 --> 2448.96
every ring is like a realm segment and

2447.52 --> 2450.96
inside every ring

2448.96 --> 2453.68
there's a ring that's exactly the same

2450.96 --> 2455.68
size

2453.68 --> 2457.7599999999998
and inside that ring might be another

2455.68 --> 2459.44
ring that's also exactly the same size

2457.76 --> 2461.6800000000003
there's the same amount of land

2459.44 --> 2463.44
and just interconnects and i kind of

2461.68 --> 2465.2799999999997
tried to represent it like that

2463.44 --> 2467.28
so you would go to the outside you think

2465.28 --> 2470.88
oh yeah a disc outside the disc

2467.28 --> 2473.0400000000004
right or a ring that's bigger

2470.88 --> 2474.88
around the disc yeah but if it's not

2473.04 --> 2476.88
spatially linear

2474.88 --> 2478.4
then that ring outside may simply be the

2476.88 --> 2480.079
same size

2478.4 --> 2482.319
and the ring outside of that will also

2480.079 --> 2484.96
be the same size right and then you got

2482.319 --> 2486.72
a looping system that also provides for

2484.96 --> 2490.48
a whole

2486.72 --> 2492.7999999999997
chain of realms north and south

2490.48 --> 2494.319
because to the east and the west that's

2492.8 --> 2496.2400000000002
not good yeah

2494.319 --> 2497.359
that's a limited amount one way or the

2496.24 --> 2500.9599999999996
other whether it's a

2497.359 --> 2504.0789999999997
an exact rectangular looping system

2500.96 --> 2504.079
whether it is

2504.16 --> 2509.839
like this one that doesn't really matter

2510.0 --> 2518.72
at that point right anyway

2513.68 --> 2518.72
let's get back to my face

2520.0 --> 2525.44
yeah a little bit about

2523.599 --> 2526.96
how does the land interconnect what are

2525.44 --> 2527.839
the consequences does everything

2526.96 --> 2530.319
geometrically

2527.839 --> 2531.2
fit right just because we know the earth

2530.319 --> 2535.44
is flat

2531.2 --> 2538.7999999999997
because there's no curvature black swan

2535.44 --> 2542.16
doesn't mean that everything is exactly

2538.8 --> 2543.119
the way we like to think it is we have

2542.16 --> 2545.1189999999997
to find out

2543.119 --> 2546.1600000000003
there's more to discover is it a literal

2545.119 --> 2548.88
disc does it all

2546.16 --> 2550.0
exactly fit in the euclidean fashion or

2548.88 --> 2552.88
does it not

2550.0 --> 2554.319
exactly fit in the euclidean fashion and

2552.88 --> 2556.4
what do you do then

2554.319 --> 2558.4
yeah then arwen comes in with this

2556.4 --> 2561.04
little spatial loopy

2558.4 --> 2562.96
wizardry to try and explain what the

2561.04 --> 2564.88
possibilities are and hope that

2562.96 --> 2566.319
someday maybe in a freaking hundred

2564.88 --> 2570.2400000000002
years or something

2566.319 --> 2572.56
people will finally start to understand

2570.24 --> 2574.72
because these days it doesn't seem like

2572.56 --> 2574.72
it

2577.28 --> 2582.96
all right so that's my presentation yeah

2580.4 --> 2585.92
2021 the flat globe

2582.96 --> 2586.88
well i put that forward in my very very

2585.92 --> 2590.48
first hangout

2586.88 --> 2592.319
ever in the flat globe it's just so

2590.48 --> 2595.28
ironic it's almost like it has to be a

2592.319 --> 2600.0
flat glove it's just too ironic

2595.28 --> 2600.0
for god to not decide upon that

2601.2 --> 2607.839
but yeah who knows it's just another

2604.839 --> 2607.839
option

2609.44 --> 2612.59
[Music]

2620.52 --> 2627.359
okay what the michael jones what is

2625.04 --> 2627.359
that

2629.04 --> 2639.52
warmness what's the ormus

2634.4 --> 2642.88
sounds vaguely familiar anyway

2639.52 --> 2646.079
yeah any questions

2642.88 --> 2649.839
i can continue i

2646.079 --> 2649.8390000000004
i have more pictures

2651.839 --> 2654.24
let's see

2660.4 --> 2679.359
i could show my antiquater

2676.079 --> 2679.3590000000004
the antiquater

2680.48 --> 2691.839
hold on

2697.839 --> 2709.2799999999997
all right so this would be ah

2704.72 --> 2709.2799999999997
yeah a sort of perspective view

2709.599 --> 2715.119
without uh any kind of yeah

2712.64 --> 2715.92
if everything is a vacuum the vacuum

2715.119 --> 2719.2000000000003
perspective

2715.92 --> 2722.4
side on view from outside of the loop

2719.2 --> 2724.0
is the west because this is literally

2722.4 --> 2726.56
viewing through

2724.0 --> 2728.24
what is a loop in on its on itself so

2726.56 --> 2729.68
it's almost like a fifth dimensional

2728.24 --> 2733.7599999999998
perspective

2729.68 --> 2735.52
on the physical available space of the

2733.76 --> 2737.92
earth realm a side on view

2735.52 --> 2740.48
to explain the equator and the

2737.92 --> 2742.7200000000003
antiquater

2740.48 --> 2744.88
presuming in this case that it is

2742.72 --> 2746.48
exactly rectangular looping because it

2744.88 --> 2748.079
would be a little difficult to draw it

2746.48 --> 2749.28
but i could draw it like i could

2748.079 --> 2751.119
basically

2749.28 --> 2754.1600000000003
the drawings i just showed you i could

2751.119 --> 2758.839
basically adapt this drawing to become

2754.16 --> 2761.839
like that model on this perspective side

2758.839 --> 2761.839
view

2766.24 --> 2771.2799999999997
right so i hope this is

2769.359 --> 2773.04
clear enough it's kind of a pencil

2771.28 --> 2775.8390000000004
sketchy sketch drawing

2773.04 --> 2775.839
i know

2778.4 --> 2782.2400000000002
gotta keep it in the loop keep me in the

2780.64 --> 2784.16
loop okay

2782.24 --> 2786.839
or you can't physically really go out of

2784.16 --> 2788.0789999999997
it you might be able to in your spirit

2786.839 --> 2791.52
but

2788.079 --> 2794.8
not physically it's the available space

2791.52 --> 2796.96
for matter so there is no space

2794.8 --> 2798.4
outside of the loop or unless there are

2796.96 --> 2801.52
other

2798.4 --> 2803.2000000000003
weird loop segments

2801.52 --> 2805.2
is the west of us that you can't

2803.2 --> 2805.5989999999997
normally reach and unless you i don't

2805.2 --> 2809.04
know

2805.599 --> 2811.04
break the fifth dimension just warp

2809.04 --> 2812.88
into that other segment and who knows

2811.04 --> 2815.92
it's maybe it's the same maybe it's that

2812.88 --> 2817.04
the infamous parallel dimensions of the

2815.92 --> 2818.64
same world that

2817.04 --> 2821.04
science fiction likes to talk about

2818.64 --> 2822.319
maybe they are in the other loops right

2821.04 --> 2824.96
next to us

2822.319 --> 2825.44
yeah yeah that's what you get when you

2824.96 --> 2828.079
like

2825.44 --> 2829.2000000000003
really get out there with this the

2828.079 --> 2831.44
option

2829.2 --> 2833.72
as a concept it's really freaking weird

2831.44 --> 2835.119
what you think you need the globe and

2833.72 --> 2837.52
heliocentrism

2835.119 --> 2839.359
to have a freaking surreal world that

2837.52 --> 2842.8
might actually turn out to be real

2839.359 --> 2846.72
no you don't you got the rectangular

2842.8 --> 2850.6400000000003
looping system and special non-linearity

2846.72 --> 2853.359
in a god-made realm system

2850.64 --> 2855.839
that can be pretty yeah pretty freaking

2853.359 --> 2855.839
surreal

2856.16 --> 2861.5989999999997
and actually be actual and not just

2859.52 --> 2873.839
atheist science fiction nonsense how

2861.599 --> 2873.839
about that

2887.44 --> 2894.96
that's also some say that if you

2891.119 --> 2896.319
take these things if you take these

2894.96 --> 2901.839
things what

2896.319 --> 2901.839
you end up stuck on earth what

2914.0 --> 2916.319
hmm

2917.44 --> 2921.92
a 13 dimension idea right yeah but a

2920.4 --> 2925.6800000000003
ramistant stone when you're talking

2921.92 --> 2927.28
about like consecutive dimensions as in

2925.68 --> 2929.04
the third dimension the fourth the fifth

2927.28 --> 2931.52
dissect that's

2929.04 --> 2933.2
a different type of conceptualization of

2931.52 --> 2936.16
a dimension

2933.2 --> 2936.96
you know it in science fiction dimension

2936.16 --> 2941.7599999999998
has often be

2936.96 --> 2943.359
reified as another physical realm

2941.76 --> 2945.28
understanding or you go into the other

2943.359 --> 2947.7599999999998
dimension oh everything's different

2945.28 --> 2950.1600000000003
we're in another dimension

2947.76 --> 2951.76
right that's kind of a reification of

2950.16 --> 2952.5589999999997
the concept of dimensions because

2951.76 --> 2955.3590000000004
dimensions

2952.559 --> 2956.0
are all there all of it all the

2955.359 --> 2959.92
dimensions

2956.0 --> 2962.24
are simultaneously present it's just

2959.92 --> 2964.079
can you get there can you actually

2962.24 --> 2967.4399999999996
attain

2964.079 --> 2971.8390000000004
that what it means to

2967.44 --> 2971.839
know that dimension can you handle that

2972.4 --> 2976.64
do you have everything that you require

2974.64 --> 2978.8799999999997
in order to attain that

2976.64 --> 2979.839
that's like dimensional ascension that's

2978.88 --> 2982.0
like

2979.839 --> 2983.92
what was originally like in 90s even

2982.0 --> 2984.72
it's like we're going to reach the fifth

2983.92 --> 2986.079
dimension

2984.72 --> 2987.7599999999998
like our consciousness is going to

2986.079 --> 2990.88
ascend yeah

2987.76 --> 2993.8390000000004
well that's a more logical way

2990.88 --> 2995.44
to represent it than to say oh there is

2993.839 --> 3000.0
another

2995.44 --> 3001.76
spatial segment parallel to us

3000.0 --> 3003.599
and that is really what has been refined

3001.76 --> 3006.8
in science fiction

3003.599 --> 3009.839
and the pseudoscience theory

3006.8 --> 3012.319
theorists yapped on about that

3009.839 --> 3013.04
when actually that's not how it should

3012.319 --> 3016.72
work at all

3013.04 --> 3018.839
but here's the big but yeah

3016.72 --> 3020.319
when you're talking about spatial

3018.839 --> 3024.48
non-linear

3020.319 --> 3024.48
looping realm systems

3024.839 --> 3030.24
yeah that might actually then be

3027.68 --> 3033.359
possible

3030.24 --> 3036.64
right in a flat earth

3033.359 --> 3040.4
with a looping self-contained

3036.64 --> 3041.5989999999997
realm of physical space that is a

3040.4 --> 3044.6800000000003
limited volume

3041.599 --> 3048.079
and then there might be other

3044.68 --> 3050.64
self-contained looping systems

3048.079 --> 3052.559
might even be mirror universes up to

3050.64 --> 3054.0789999999997
that point i don't know

3052.559 --> 3056.88
i don't know i don't know how to get

3054.079 --> 3057.28
there i don't know the things that i've

3056.88 --> 3060.2400000000002
seen

3057.28 --> 3061.76
if that is science fiction that were my

3060.24 --> 3063.68
that like the demons were trying to [ __ ]

3061.76 --> 3065.92
with me with my own ideas trying to make

3063.68 --> 3069.839
me reify them in my mind

3065.92 --> 3069.839
or whether that's just a conception

3070.72 --> 3074.7999999999997
i don't know i don't know how to test

3072.559 --> 3076.559
that i don't know how to escape the loop

3074.8 --> 3078.2400000000002
yeah yeah now there's probably some

3076.559 --> 3078.6400000000003
people that could go really nuts over

3078.24 --> 3083.359
that

3078.64 --> 3085.44
how do you escape the loop of the realm

3083.359 --> 3088.88
of the space of the realm how do it's

3085.44 --> 3092.079
like the idea of going into a wormhole

3088.88 --> 3093.76
yeah well maybe

3092.079 --> 3095.52
there is something like that maybe you

3093.76 --> 3097.44
can actually go to the other dimension

3095.52 --> 3101.119
there's even freaking hints of this in

3097.44 --> 3101.44
magic tradition [ __ ] it's yeah that's

3101.119 --> 3105.359
where

3101.44 --> 3107.52
things really get freaky right

3105.359 --> 3108.4
the world is a freaking surreal place

3107.52 --> 3110.8
people it

3108.4 --> 3112.079
really really is and i know it's very

3110.8 --> 3114.319
tough

3112.079 --> 3115.44
but i think it is i think that a lot of

3114.319 --> 3118.64
this is just

3115.44 --> 3119.599
like i am just trying to mechanically

3118.64 --> 3121.839
understand

3119.599 --> 3122.7200000000003
the things that have always potentially

3121.839 --> 3126.96
been there

3122.72 --> 3128.9599999999996
hidden in like magic traditions and [ __ ]

3126.96 --> 3130.319
but i'm approaching it like a physicist

3128.96 --> 3134.079
that dares to step

3130.319 --> 3134.079
outside of the virtual box

3134.319 --> 3138.24
right it's a very funny expression at

3136.48 --> 3140.48
this point when i'm talking about

3138.24 --> 3141.52
escaping the loop of the rectangular

3140.48 --> 3144.079
looping system

3141.52 --> 3147.52
yeah stepping outside of the box funny

3144.079 --> 3147.52
how that works out isn't it

3150.839 --> 3157.04
huh

3153.68 --> 3159.16
right right

3157.04 --> 3160.88
but when it comes to actual

3159.16 --> 3163.92
dimensionality

3160.88 --> 3163.92
the third dimension

3164.8 --> 3172.48
our experience time line based

3169.599 --> 3174.559
one direction timeline based experience

3172.48 --> 3178.559
yeah that's three-dimensional

3174.559 --> 3180.96
i believe that the dimensions above

3178.559 --> 3182.8
which time is not a mechanical literal

3180.96 --> 3184.64
dimension that's a reification in a

3182.8 --> 3186.4
mathematical model

3184.64 --> 3189.68
right but i think that the dimensions

3186.4 --> 3191.52
above time becomes more fluid

3189.68 --> 3193.2799999999997
so let's just say there's an in between

3191.52 --> 3195.28
i like to call the fifth dimension

3193.28 --> 3197.8390000000004
the the timeless dimension you know like

3195.28 --> 3200.559
that but maybe there is like in between

3197.839 --> 3202.24
maybe it's not like click you are now in

3200.559 --> 3203.28
the fifth dimension now maybe there is

3202.24 --> 3205.1189999999997
like a spectrum

3203.28 --> 3206.96
in between so let's just say there's a

3205.119 --> 3209.92
fourth dimension

3206.96 --> 3211.92
where time is still kind of linear but

3209.92 --> 3215.52
it's not entirely

3211.92 --> 3217.599
linear like there are like

3215.52 --> 3219.359
issues and you can for example grab into

3217.599 --> 3222.319
the future into the past

3219.359 --> 3223.2
who knows right you can see maybe maybe

3222.319 --> 3224.64
grab in there

3223.2 --> 3228.48
well that would be the fifth dimension

3224.64 --> 3231.04
you would not be absolutely without time

3228.48 --> 3232.96
but you would be in between now this is

3231.04 --> 3235.119
science fiction mind you this is not

3232.96 --> 3237.76
me again science right this is just a

3235.119 --> 3239.92
conception there's no proof of this

3237.76 --> 3241.6800000000003
i'm not trying to revise a mathematical

3239.92 --> 3244.319
model here it's just

3241.68 --> 3245.04
based on my experience because my

3244.319 --> 3248.5589999999997
experience

3245.04 --> 3250.96
visions extreme dreams

3248.559 --> 3252.48
i've seen things things seen things of

3250.96 --> 3255.68
the future that i cannot

3252.48 --> 3258.48
explain that i've seen

3255.68 --> 3260.3999999999996
my own visualizations and experience

3258.48 --> 3261.92
from the future there is no logical

3260.4 --> 3264.1600000000003
explanation for this

3261.92 --> 3266.8
if we are purely bound by the three

3264.16 --> 3266.7999999999997
dimensions

3266.96 --> 3270.88
if there is no connection to some

3269.52 --> 3275.44
timeless

3270.88 --> 3278.799
interface and i've experienced this

3275.44 --> 3280.7200000000003
so that's why i pursue this idea

3278.799 --> 3282.079
that there is like an ascension where

3280.72 --> 3285.7599999999998
eventually yeah

3282.079 --> 3289.28
time becomes fluid you start to

3285.76 --> 3289.76
just know you just understand you just

3289.28 --> 3291.76
freaking

3289.76 --> 3293.599
understand what's gonna happen you just

3291.76 --> 3297.5200000000004
know it's insane

3293.599 --> 3307.839
but you just do it's like logical like

3297.52 --> 3307.839
yeah hey nathan oakley

3313.44 --> 3321.839
if you see it do you cause it

3317.04 --> 3321.839
is that a philosophical question

3330.47 --> 3336.3999999999996
[Music]

3333.119 --> 3339.92
if you see it do you cause it

3336.4 --> 3342.96
well if you witness something

3339.92 --> 3345.599
then it becomes a part of you

3342.96 --> 3346.4
of your potentially interdimensional

3345.599 --> 3348.6400000000003
consciousness

3346.4 --> 3349.599
so yes in a sense if you witness

3348.64 --> 3352.48
something

3349.599 --> 3354.88
it does become like it literally becomes

3352.48 --> 3360.72
a part of your spirit

3354.88 --> 3360.7200000000003
and will help shape you so in that sense

3360.88 --> 3369.28
but do you cause it i don't know

3364.4 --> 3369.28
do we cause it or do it does it cause us

3373.119 --> 3380.96
you see

3376.96 --> 3380.96
that may be a bit of a trick answer

3385.28 --> 3392.3190000000004
right here we go again yeah

3388.319 --> 3395.44
it's not a blessing you know

3392.319 --> 3396.4
i've seen things i was just like when i

3395.44 --> 3398.799
went through that

3396.4 --> 3400.2400000000002
thing i was just really afraid that i

3398.799 --> 3404.72
was going to see

3400.24 --> 3406.319
myself just ending up horribly somewhere

3404.72 --> 3408.5589999999997
when i started to figure out that it

3406.319 --> 3410.48
would that was like i was really seeing

3408.559 --> 3412.96
things in the future

3410.48 --> 3413.68
in that vision experience i was

3412.96 --> 3416.7200000000003
terrified

3413.68 --> 3418.8799999999997
but they used that against me by then

3416.72 --> 3420.48
starting to show my own fantasies

3418.88 --> 3425.2000000000003
reified in a

3420.48 --> 3427.28
yeah in a holodeck like fashion

3425.2 --> 3429.4399999999996
it's like they used everything against

3427.28 --> 3429.44
me

3430.839 --> 3438.0
everything but i did get to see

3433.2 --> 3441.839
things that now turn out to be like yeah

3438.0 --> 3444.559
even back then i like one of the longest

3441.839 --> 3446.96
lasting memories is like

3444.559 --> 3448.2400000000002
like me seeing something and then it's

3446.96 --> 3451.76
like what

3448.24 --> 3454.5589999999997
hillary clinton against the against

3451.76 --> 3456.0
some businessman trump like what that

3454.559 --> 3457.92
doesn't make any sense to me

3456.0 --> 3459.52
like it lit like iris approached it at

3457.92 --> 3461.28
the time when i saw it

3459.52 --> 3463.28
from that perspective like that doesn't

3461.28 --> 3467.0400000000004
make any sense to me i don't really care

3463.28 --> 3467.0400000000004
why should i care about that nonsense

3467.44 --> 3472.319
and i did not even understand like i am

3469.599 --> 3475.44
seeing something of the future now

3472.319 --> 3478.16
like i didn't understand

3475.44 --> 3479.119
i was seeing something in the future

3478.16 --> 3480.8799999999997
even though i

3479.119 --> 3483.92
knew i was seeing something in the

3480.88 --> 3483.92
future how the f

3487.28 --> 3492.0
like it's impossible it's like i'm

3489.28 --> 3502.079
witnessing a paradox

3492.0 --> 3505.599
it's so freaky

3502.079 --> 3505.92
maybe it it just was freaky to maybe

3505.599 --> 3508.0
they

3505.92 --> 3509.6800000000003
did really know maybe it was written

3508.0 --> 3512.559
down on an agenda and

3509.68 --> 3515.2
that guy just showed this told me

3512.559 --> 3518.0
through the other dimension

3515.2 --> 3519.4399999999996
to not leave physical proof maybe that's

3518.0 --> 3521.92
what happened and i just

3519.44 --> 3523.119
reified it myself into seeing into the

3521.92 --> 3525.52
future

3523.119 --> 3526.319
maybe it was literally written down in

3525.52 --> 3528.64
some

3526.319 --> 3529.7599999999998
deep deep agenda that he had access to i

3528.64 --> 3532.72
don't know man

3529.76 --> 3532.7200000000003
i don't know

3534.72 --> 3538.3999999999996
it's all in my head literally i don't

3536.96 --> 3540.64
know what it is

3538.4 --> 3541.92
it's just that experience was pretty

3540.64 --> 3544.319
freaky

3541.92 --> 3545.04
what i have yeah i just have retro in

3544.319 --> 3547.44
retrospect

3545.04 --> 3548.72
evidence for myself i can't prove it

3547.44 --> 3550.319
anymore because these things have

3548.72 --> 3552.319
transpired but i have proof for myself

3550.319 --> 3555.68
like whoa i've seen things

3552.319 --> 3558.48
but every time i have like a

3555.68 --> 3560.48
four look on something like this is

3558.48 --> 3564.319
gonna happen

3560.48 --> 3568.2400000000002
i get a massive fear like if i'm gonna

3564.319 --> 3570.64
say this it's gonna be really bad

3568.24 --> 3572.3999999999996
like i can't say it it's like a weird

3570.64 --> 3574.96
cassandra fear

3572.4 --> 3576.64
and i'm afraid that every time i say

3574.96 --> 3579.68
something out light that that will

3576.64 --> 3582.72
actually make it not real

3579.68 --> 3587.839
but it also feels like it's

3582.72 --> 3587.839
very dangerous for me it's so weird

3590.48 --> 3596.079
so yeah i basically tried to just

3594.079 --> 3598.6400000000003
leave it alone as much as possible not

3596.079 --> 3601.04
pay attention to it anymore because

3598.64 --> 3603.52
i'm getting more productive just being

3601.04 --> 3605.44
here in the moment and doing my thing

3603.52 --> 3607.28
and not paying attention to that weird

3605.44 --> 3609.76
vision experience

3607.28 --> 3612.3190000000004
that's that's the practical result that

3609.76 --> 3612.3190000000004
i found

3612.839 --> 3615.839
right

3618.48 --> 3622.319
by thinking it did i cause it layers

3620.48 --> 3623.52
later i buried the thought i thought it

3622.319 --> 3626.319
wasn't broad enough

3623.52 --> 3626.799
well did look here we go again why are

3626.319 --> 3629.68
you

3626.799 --> 3632.0
blaming yourself for something that just

3629.68 --> 3635.44
happened to you

3632.0 --> 3637.28
like what if you know in a way

3635.44 --> 3639.28
you could also see it in another fashion

3637.28 --> 3641.6800000000003
maybe yeah not

3639.28 --> 3643.119
trying to overstep anything but what if

3641.68 --> 3645.04
it's just

3643.119 --> 3646.559
a piece of the universe or even god

3645.04 --> 3649.839
himself or some

3646.559 --> 3652.6400000000003
thing that just basically came with an

3649.839 --> 3654.96
announcement this is gonna happen

3652.64 --> 3656.8799999999997
maybe you didn't do that you were just

3654.96 --> 3660.48
on the receiving end

3656.88 --> 3663.76
of like a over dimensional communication

3660.48 --> 3664.4
you know some mediums look at it like

3663.76 --> 3666.6400000000003
that

3664.4 --> 3670.079
just like that and i think there's a

3666.64 --> 3672.96
that that that's a viable concept

3670.079 --> 3673.599
you didn't do that like did you want to

3672.96 --> 3677.2
do that

3673.599 --> 3679.6800000000003
was your will bound to yeah i want this

3677.2 --> 3685.839
then how could you say that you somehow

3679.68 --> 3685.839
magically did that that makes no sense

3696.839 --> 3699.839
right

3700.88 --> 3706.1600000000003
yeah it's the cassandra complex you know

3704.0 --> 3709.28
seeing things in the future is it's

3706.16 --> 3709.2799999999997
really just a curse

3709.839 --> 3713.2799999999997
or no not literally a curse you could

3711.92 --> 3716.2400000000002
see it as a curse but it's

3713.28 --> 3717.76
it's just punishing that's a better it's

3716.24 --> 3721.2
punishing

3717.76 --> 3722.6400000000003
it's not a great thing to have it really

3721.2 --> 3727.839
isn't

3722.64 --> 3727.839
it's not pleasant

3729.05 --> 3732.199
[Music]

3738.839 --> 3741.839
hmm

3748.88 --> 3756.799
right but then again yeah hey isn't

3752.319 --> 3759.92
punishment also the thing through which

3756.799 --> 3761.52
strength and redemption is found so i

3759.92 --> 3763.599
kind of tried to utilize that and

3761.52 --> 3766.079
basically said okay instead of being oh

3763.599 --> 3769.3590000000004
i'm cursed i see the future is all

3766.079 --> 3772.96
oh i thought like wow maybe i can just

3769.359 --> 3775.0389999999998
use this get over it

3772.96 --> 3776.799
if that is possible because it the

3775.039 --> 3779.5200000000004
punishment yeah

3776.799 --> 3780.48
you know be careful and actually become

3779.52 --> 3784.88
more like a

3780.48 --> 3786.72
wizard and contain it

3784.88 --> 3788.799
and try to get something good out of it

3786.72 --> 3791.52
and and build my life

3788.799 --> 3794.319
all in the name of good of really trying

3791.52 --> 3797.2
to follow the path

3794.319 --> 3798.72
which much much later in life i've

3797.2 --> 3802.5589999999997
started to give a name to it

3798.72 --> 3804.64
the path but that's always what i felt

3802.559 --> 3807.119
it's always what i kind of tried i just

3804.64 --> 3808.72
was so uncertain so in afraid that i was

3807.119 --> 3812.4
going to be

3808.72 --> 3815.5989999999997
declared some kind of heretic or

3812.4 --> 3817.839
yeah a witch in a negative way all that

3815.599 --> 3820.1600000000003
i was very afraid of that a lot of the

3817.839 --> 3820.16
time

3821.119 --> 3825.44
now not so much anymore and also i just

3823.68 --> 3827.68
found confidence

3825.44 --> 3828.7200000000003
it's like okay i am just what i am i

3827.68 --> 3830.5589999999997
have these things

3828.72 --> 3832.5589999999997
they can be a curse to me and i don't

3830.559 --> 3834.3190000000004
try to hide everything about it so that

3832.559 --> 3835.28
people don't find out that i'm a little

3834.319 --> 3838.48
weird

3835.28 --> 3841.039
right or i could just say screw

3838.48 --> 3844.48

3847.92 --> 3851.599

3848.48 --> 3853.52
try to find another home

3851.599 --> 3858.0
being something else i'm just gonna be

3853.52 --> 3858.0

3860.079 --> 3865.76

3866.0 --> 3872.0
back holy [ __ ] like things from season

3869.68 --> 3872.0
three

3878.839 --> 3883.929
wow

3880.8 --> 3883.929
[Music]

3884.64 --> 3892.4
oh yeah sure

3888.0 --> 3892.4
next week's lottery numbers god

3893.2 --> 3898.5589999999997
oh yeah that's that's fantastic man that

3895.76 --> 3902.559
that's all you need

3898.559 --> 3904.2400000000002
just subtly get rich out of nowhere

3902.559 --> 3906.0
after you've proclaimed that you looked

3904.24 --> 3907.7599999999998
in the future then everybody

3906.0 --> 3910.319
think you're gonna be that everybody

3907.76 --> 3913.039
will think you're a grabbler

3910.319 --> 3913.52
that you abuse your powers to get rich

3913.039 --> 3917.3590000000004
and

3913.52 --> 3920.559
hey is that true are they wrong you know

3917.359 --> 3920.96
oh yeah so that's gonna be make you very

3920.559 --> 3922.3190000000004
happy

3920.96 --> 3923.52
having all that money and suddenly

3922.319 --> 3924.48
everybody knows you're rich and they're

3923.52 --> 3926.799
gonna bother you

3924.48 --> 3928.2400000000002
and people are gonna try to pry that

3926.799 --> 3931.28
money out of you

3928.24 --> 3934.319
yeah that's that's brilliant man that's

3931.28 --> 3934.3190000000004
gonna solve everything

3934.839 --> 3937.839
um

3939.359 --> 3943.119
oh the money on the needy because just

3942.16 --> 3945.68
giving stuff

3943.119 --> 3947.039
to the needy that always helps them

3945.68 --> 3951.839
right

3947.039 --> 3951.8390000000004
uh no it doesn't

3952.24 --> 3957.5989999999997
just giving stuff away to the needy

3955.52 --> 3959.119
doesn't really help them on average now

3957.599 --> 3961.44
it's not saying that you should never

3959.119 --> 3964.96
help out the needy

3961.44 --> 3968.079
but that's not like they thrive

3964.96 --> 3968.079
much more on just

3968.4 --> 3972.2400000000002
attention respect education people

3971.599 --> 3975.28
taking them

3972.24 --> 3977.2799999999997
serious people believing in them they

3975.28 --> 3981.3590000000004
believing in themselves

3977.28 --> 3981.3590000000004
and actually getting out of it right

3985.599 --> 3994.1600000000003
just throwing money at at people

3990.24 --> 3994.16
it rarely helps

3994.48 --> 4000.799
it serious it's historical

3998.319 --> 4002.72
so yeah it's very cute it's very very

4000.799 --> 4004.839
cute it's not gonna happen though

4002.72 --> 4006.72
not doing that you're not supposed to do

4004.839 --> 4011.2799999999997
that

4006.72 --> 4013.5989999999997
yes really cute abuse all my power to

4011.28 --> 4014.559
force through this ideal that's

4013.599 --> 4016.6400000000003
brilliant

4014.559 --> 4021.8390000000004
brilliant yeah it's not gonna end

4016.64 --> 4021.839
catastrophic at all

4034.079 --> 4039.599
no it's really cute it's not how it

4037.28 --> 4039.599
works

4040.0 --> 4043.52
even if my three-dimensional

4042.72 --> 4046.0789999999997
consciousness

4043.52 --> 4048.0
would think like yeah i'm gonna do this

4046.079 --> 4050.48
my over-dimensional conscience is not

4048.0 --> 4054.88
gonna allow that

4050.48 --> 4054.88
it's just no because

4055.2 --> 4058.24
don't i'm not a hundred percent sure but

4057.92 --> 4059.839
for

4058.24 --> 4061.2799999999997
just a general scenario that would be

4059.839 --> 4064.5589999999997
abuse

4061.28 --> 4066.88
like i should use my power

4064.559 --> 4070.4
where i'm good at and not just throw it

4066.88 --> 4070.4
away on something like that

4073.119 --> 4076.2400000000002
logos to me is much more important and i

4075.68 --> 4079.7599999999998
don't

4076.24 --> 4082.5589999999997
like money i just needed

4079.76 --> 4082.559
to survive

4084.48 --> 4086.88
here

4087.52 --> 4091.68
but i'm not like oh quickly get the big

4090.559 --> 4094.7200000000003
score

4091.68 --> 4098.4
no i just want to get by and i want to

4094.72 --> 4098.4
be productive and i want to grow

4100.239 --> 4105.839
i want to get better at what i do it's

4102.319 --> 4105.839000000001
much more important to me

4112.35 --> 4115.459000000001
[Music]

4116.839 --> 4119.839
right

4126.239 --> 4129.5199999999995
and use money to help people learn how

4128.319 --> 4131.52
to fish okay well

4129.52 --> 4133.839000000001
yeah that would be a much more sensible

4131.52 --> 4133.839000000001
approach

4140.239 --> 4142.5599999999995
right

4143.44 --> 4149.599999999999
but i tried to do that at all time

4146.64 --> 4150.08
in indirect i always when i engage with

4149.6 --> 4152.799
people

4150.08 --> 4154.64
it is because i see potential in them to

4152.799 --> 4158.48
sort of awaken to

4154.64 --> 4162.0
realize more skills and then

4158.48 --> 4163.3589999999995
live more sensibly waste less cause less

4162.0 --> 4166.4
damage

4163.359 --> 4168.56
and help kind of stabilize the world

4166.4 --> 4169.44
so i try to do that with every single

4168.56 --> 4171.52
action

4169.44 --> 4173.44
now don't always succeed sometimes i

4171.52 --> 4174.2390000000005
just get pissed off and i get a little

4173.44 --> 4177.599999999999
unproductive

4174.239 --> 4178.5599999999995
unfortunately i try to do it in a timed

4177.6 --> 4181.04
fashion where

4178.56 --> 4184.2390000000005
yeah sometimes getting angry is really

4181.04 --> 4189.839
justified and is just a good pointer

4184.239 --> 4189.839
so but yeah nobody's perfect

4192.56 --> 4197.360000000001
but i tried to do it just with what i

4194.56 --> 4198.719
got and i got a lot of mind i got a lot

4197.36 --> 4201.679
of insight this is

4198.719 --> 4202.96
like almost free currency to me i have

4201.679 --> 4205.36
this

4202.96 --> 4206.88
it's very rare for other people so i

4205.36 --> 4210.239
give this

4206.88 --> 4213.28
right money not so good with that

4210.239 --> 4217.36
at all i suck

4213.28 --> 4220.159
at it compared to others really do

4217.36 --> 4222.32
so i'm not just gonna then try to score

4220.159 --> 4223.759999999999
big and help them with something that

4222.32 --> 4225.679
i'm not really good at it's probably

4223.76 --> 4228.8
gonna end up wasted and making me

4225.679 --> 4231.84
terribly terribly miserable right i'm

4228.8 --> 4231.84
not going to do that

4233.199 --> 4237.28
hey robin's down needs snowing cool

4242.84 --> 4245.84
nice

4250.96 --> 4255.679
call the serenity prayer it's too long

4253.04 --> 4255.679
from the chat

4256.84 --> 4259.84
okay

4266.4 --> 4275.44
no i here we go again i don't think he's

4270.08 --> 4275.44
addressing that specifically don't worry

4286.08 --> 4289.44
do i want to come back to earth in your

4288.48 --> 4292.4
next life

4289.44 --> 4294.799999999999
to once again fight for flat earth i

4292.4 --> 4294.799999999999
don't know

4294.96 --> 4298.64
that depends on how it's going to end

4298.719 --> 4305.52
maybe when i am done with this life

4303.6 --> 4307.04
maybe it's just no longer necessary

4305.52 --> 4309.6
maybe the lesson is just

4307.04 --> 4311.28
completely sunk in maybe there will be

4309.6 --> 4314.08
other issues maybe

4311.28 --> 4315.5199999999995
like maybe it's the end and there's

4314.08 --> 4317.679
simply nothing left

4315.52 --> 4319.4400000000005
maybe nobody is gonna come back after a

4317.679 --> 4323.6
certain point

4319.44 --> 4325.678999999999
i don't know maybe this world will be

4323.6 --> 4329.84
done with me at some point and i'm just

4325.679 --> 4329.84
i'm not gonna come back i don't know

4334.08 --> 4342.5599999999995
you were doing a work in your former

4335.76 --> 4345.679
life that's cute

4342.56 --> 4349.360000000001
if you say so i don't know what that is

4345.679 --> 4351.28
i don't know if these things are actual

4349.36 --> 4352.5599999999995
i think it has more to do with just

4351.28 --> 4357.599999999999
interdimensional

4352.56 --> 4361.4400000000005
resonation with very heavy frequency

4357.6 --> 4364.56
it's like their spirit

4361.44 --> 4364.96
just touches you throughout time and

4364.56 --> 4367.84
then

4364.96 --> 4368.56
you sort of like atta you synchronize

4367.84 --> 4370.64
with them

4368.56 --> 4372.64
i think i don't really know about

4370.64 --> 4374.8
reincarnation the way that people

4372.64 --> 4379.12
conceive of it like it's a literal

4374.8 --> 4381.360000000001
linear consecutive set of incarnations i

4379.12 --> 4383.44
don't know that

4381.36 --> 4385.679
i often think that our experience is

4383.44 --> 4390.0
more like a side effect

4385.679 --> 4390.0
than it is what we actually are

4390.239 --> 4394.0
so i just don't know but hey if you want

4393.199 --> 4399.839999999999
to think that

4394.0 --> 4399.84
sure i

4402.239 --> 4405.44
interdimensional i just explained to

4404.159 --> 4408.879999999999
some of that

4405.44 --> 4412.0
it's just in the timeless dimension

4408.88 --> 4415.76
if you touch there then you may

4412.0 --> 4418.96
touch everything potentially

4415.76 --> 4422.08
if your spirit can handle that

4418.96 --> 4422.4800000000005
and you may find even through dreams

4422.08 --> 4425.199
just

4422.48 --> 4427.5199999999995
a a resonance with certain types of

4425.199 --> 4430.719
figures

4427.52 --> 4433.679
that then sort of become part of you

4430.719 --> 4436.32
by touching them through the other

4433.679 --> 4436.32
dimensions

4436.56 --> 4440.080000000001
sounds kind of mystical doesn't it but

4439.199 --> 4442.639999999999
that's

4440.08 --> 4455.84
another model for the conception of

4442.64 --> 4455.84
what's going on

4459.58 --> 4466.4
[Music]

4463.28 --> 4469.28
if there will be two what

4466.4 --> 4472.159
does nathan why do you ask me why don't

4469.28 --> 4472.159
you ask nathan

4473.84 --> 4477.6
what is the point why are you asking

4480.84 --> 4483.84
this

4487.76 --> 4492.08
that's just conjecture yeah no [ __ ]

4493.92 --> 4498.4800000000005
just giving an alternative conception

4496.88 --> 4511.84
conjecture

4498.48 --> 4511.839999999999
i'm sorry you feel that way

4517.17 --> 4520.34
[Music]

4522.84 --> 4525.84
so

4552.4 --> 4558.96
yeah yeah sorry if i'm kind of like

4556.719 --> 4561.199
breaking jokes here you know if people

4558.96 --> 4564.2390000000005
just ask funny questions

4561.199 --> 4567.12
i'm just being extremely serious

4564.239 --> 4568.08
i i like to be because i'm talking about

4567.12 --> 4572.5599999999995
some pretty

4568.08 --> 4572.5599999999995
heavy complex stuff

4575.36 --> 4578.799999999999
do you know much about the mormon

4577.36 --> 4582.32
religion

4578.8 --> 4586.64
much that's no not much

4582.32 --> 4588.639999999999
but i have been there i've attended

4586.64 --> 4589.76
the mormon church right across the

4588.64 --> 4592.0
street for

4589.76 --> 4593.4400000000005
what is it at least an entire full year

4592.0 --> 4596.88
every sunday

4593.44 --> 4600.4
and i did i do have a book of mormon

4596.88 --> 4603.28
i read through some of it

4600.4 --> 4604.639999999999
and it was in it was a very interesting

4603.28 --> 4607.92
experience but

4604.64 --> 4609.280000000001
yeah it's not a perfect religion nothing

4607.92 --> 4611.36
is really

4609.28 --> 4613.759999999999
but it it was a very interesting

4611.36 --> 4618.239
experience

4613.76 --> 4621.1990000000005
so imagine imagination

4618.239 --> 4621.599999999999
is now a thing much like dudes men what

4621.199 --> 4624.799999999999
what the

4621.6 --> 4628.4800000000005
are you freaking blabbering about

4624.8 --> 4628.4800000000005
dude what the [ __ ] is your problem

4631.199 --> 4634.96
what am i trying to reify something into

4633.6 --> 4637.76
reality

4634.96 --> 4638.4800000000005
am i saying this must is this is the

4637.76 --> 4640.4800000000005
proof

4638.48 --> 4642.08
i proven it scientific no i'm not doing

4640.48 --> 4651.839999999999
that what are you whining about

4642.08 --> 4651.84
stop being so annoying sledgehammer

4652.4 --> 4656.08
i'm just trying to figure it out

4657.84 --> 4662.4800000000005
cross-referencing everything i know

4659.679 --> 4666.159
everything i've experienced and just not

4662.48 --> 4670.0
being a weenie i'm i'm trying

4666.159 --> 4671.12
bigger things just if you don't like it

4670.0 --> 4674.32
i'm sorry

4671.12 --> 4675.84
i'm just doing what i do there has been

4674.32 --> 4677.92
progress in the past

4675.84 --> 4680.159000000001
i at least got some kind of conception

4677.92 --> 4682.0
and it is getting more consistent

4680.159 --> 4683.28
it is kind of consistent but it's also

4682.0 --> 4686.48
clearing up

4683.28 --> 4688.0
the further i go i find errors then i

4686.48 --> 4689.28
correct the errors and then that

4688.0 --> 4693.6
clarifies more

4689.28 --> 4698.32
in the entire

4693.6 --> 4700.64
world model in my mind so

4698.32 --> 4700.639999999999
right

4702.32 --> 4707.84
then what's the problem

4713.76 --> 4716.0
what

4718.84 --> 4721.84
right

4725.34 --> 4728.529
[Music]

4732.84 --> 4737.28
what

4735.12 --> 4738.48
but you don't have to mix reality with

4737.28 --> 4742.239
conjecture

4738.48 --> 4744.718999999999
if you don't want to i have experiences

4742.239 --> 4746.159
i'm trying to figure them out and i'm

4744.719 --> 4749.36
building a big model

4746.159 --> 4752.719
for everything that clues

4749.36 --> 4755.839999999999
includes extra dimensional experiences

4752.719 --> 4757.84
it includes trying to figure out

4755.84 --> 4760.32
what we think is reincarnation what it

4757.84 --> 4763.360000000001
is what is actually happening

4760.32 --> 4766.4
what what is wisdom right

4763.36 --> 4768.159
just fundamental things all of it

4766.4 --> 4770.879999999999
i'm just really doing my best to

4768.159 --> 4771.679
basically complete a wizard's journey

4770.88 --> 4773.76
here

4771.679 --> 4775.04
in the old style before it all got

4773.76 --> 4778.400000000001
[ __ ]

4775.04 --> 4782.239
by a bunch of squirters

4778.4 --> 4783.44
and creeps vampires just doing it the

4782.239 --> 4791.839999999999
old way

4783.44 --> 4791.839999999999
doing it live

4796.64 --> 4800.320000000001
yeah george sanford that's that's a good

4798.64 --> 4802.2390000000005
technical description but i'm talking

4800.32 --> 4805.599999999999
about like what

4802.239 --> 4810.48
from beginning to end what is it what

4805.6 --> 4810.4800000000005
is the the experience differential

4812.159 --> 4814.4
why

4817.36 --> 4821.839999999999
from a mechanical perspective because i

4820.4 --> 4824.0
do always bring the mechanical

4821.84 --> 4826.4800000000005
perspective into everything every time

4824.0 --> 4827.199
not that it it's just a tool it's my

4826.48 --> 4830.32
virtual

4827.199 --> 4830.32
math you could say

4831.199 --> 4836.799999999999
because i don't yeah

4834.4 --> 4838.159
i don't it's only a tool it's not the

4836.8 --> 4840.400000000001
reality it's not like

4838.159 --> 4844.0
i exclude everything that's not mechanic

4840.4 --> 4846.159
no no i don't do that anymore i used to

4844.0 --> 4848.48
when i was still kind of an atheist i'm

4846.159 --> 4853.04
very young

4848.48 --> 4853.04
15 12 and 17.

4854.639 --> 4875.84
no i'm not this

4857.76 --> 4875.84
body transforms thanks

4877.52 --> 4881.84
oh dude why are you so rude here we go

4880.239 --> 4889.839999999999
again

4881.84 --> 4889.84
it's just a question

4904.48 --> 4910.959999999999
right at the same token in the past

4909.12 --> 4912.239
yeah but don't worry about it buddy

4910.96 --> 4915.6
transform see

4912.239 --> 4916.0
he probably asks because yeah here here

4915.6 --> 4919.52
we go

4916.0 --> 4923.36
again right yeah addressing you but also

4919.52 --> 4926.080000000001
just the saying it's weird antonio

4923.36 --> 4927.36
super rats in the past there was quite a

4926.08 --> 4929.5199999999995
history

4927.36 --> 4930.88
remember patricia steer and all that

4929.52 --> 4934.88
well yeah he

4930.88 --> 4937.76
is definitely the narcissist

4934.88 --> 4939.4400000000005
and all that exactly like yeah that's so

4937.76 --> 4940.400000000001
i don't really associate with him

4939.44 --> 4942.879999999999
anymore

4940.4 --> 4944.638999999999
but he's actually said some halfway

4942.88 --> 4948.719
decent wise things

4944.639 --> 4952.0
in his day and he's also been a complete

4948.719 --> 4954.88
dick and just disgusting person but he's

4952.0 --> 4956.159
all like he has said some good things in

4954.88 --> 4959.92
some good moments

4956.159 --> 4963.839999999999
that's why it is so tragic

4959.92 --> 4965.28
all of it right because i'll never trust

4963.84 --> 4967.12
the guy again but yeah he

4965.28 --> 4969.679
that doesn't mean that things he said

4967.12 --> 4970.32
are then all just futile or anything no

4969.679 --> 4974.56
he said

4970.32 --> 4978.239
good things you know nasty people

4974.56 --> 4978.2390000000005
sometimes say good things too

4978.32 --> 4983.92
so i get it because he kind of tried to

4982.0 --> 4986.639
be a wizard too i think

4983.92 --> 4987.6
it's just like yeah that's not the way

4986.639 --> 4989.76
you do it

4987.6 --> 4991.84
you have to live it it's not just talk

4989.76 --> 5000.320000000001
you have to live it

4991.84 --> 5003.39
and that's where you fail

5000.32 --> 5003.389999999999
[Music]

5003.6 --> 5010.400000000001
right he couldn't get

5006.88 --> 5010.88
from underneath the the tool of lying he

5010.4 --> 5014.4
couldn't

5010.88 --> 5015.92
couldn't help himself are you in contact

5014.4 --> 5020.159
with patricia steer at all

5015.92 --> 5021.04
not really i think i have her on skype

5020.159 --> 5025.759999999999
but she's

5021.04 --> 5025.76
way too busy and i don't know

5026.08 --> 5029.92
i've been like in her chats and she

5027.76 --> 5031.84
always does address me but i think that

5029.92 --> 5034.4800000000005
i might be a little bit too scary or

5031.84 --> 5034.4800000000005
something now

5034.719 --> 5040.0
i'm too raw for her i say

5038.159 --> 5041.839999999999
mean things about certain people

5040.0 --> 5046.32
sometimes

5041.84 --> 5046.32
she just i don't know

5047.6 --> 5051.04
but i've always been very fond of

5049.36 --> 5054.239
patricia

5051.04 --> 5057.28
not that she's perfect but she has some

5054.239 --> 5060.5599999999995
yeah i don't know i just

5057.28 --> 5062.32
found it enjoyable and i've been like in

5060.56 --> 5064.080000000001
i've been in hangouts with her like

5062.32 --> 5067.36
twice

5064.08 --> 5071.84
was on her show and then all these

5067.36 --> 5071.839999999999
quarters make all these videos about me

5096.0 --> 5101.52
you enjoy all flat earth shows tara 306

5099.199 --> 5101.5199999999995
okay

5110.84 --> 5115.92
cool

5112.96 --> 5117.52
no not he said yeah yeah hey here we go

5115.92 --> 5121.28
again

5117.52 --> 5123.92
i know i know

5121.28 --> 5125.04
i know that he's a freaking creep

5123.92 --> 5126.88
absolutely

5125.04 --> 5128.8
that's why i don't associate him with

5126.88 --> 5130.56
him anymore and i'm glad he just leaves

5128.8 --> 5133.76
me alone

5130.56 --> 5135.280000000001
because it was really annoying but it

5133.76 --> 5140.159000000001
was also because i got

5135.28 --> 5143.44
in his space where he liked to hang out

5140.159 --> 5143.44
and i don't do that anymore

5144.56 --> 5149.6
right but yeah don't really want to get

5148.4 --> 5153.839999999999
into it

5149.6 --> 5154.320000000001
but yeah even bob has had some moments

5153.84 --> 5156.08
where he

5154.32 --> 5158.32
actually brought some interesting

5156.08 --> 5160.639
conceptions forth

5158.32 --> 5160.639
right

5161.84 --> 5170.4800000000005
but yeah that

5165.6 --> 5175.280000000001
doesn't really justify the rest of it

5170.48 --> 5178.4
and hey to just draw it out any further

5175.28 --> 5181.44
peach hey has said some pretty

5178.4 --> 5184.159
interesting things in the day now he's a

5181.44 --> 5186.4
complete lunatic

5184.159 --> 5188.48
but he has said some interesting things

5186.4 --> 5190.159
and i've even tried i basically even

5188.48 --> 5192.4
just tried to say like dude

5190.159 --> 5194.32
why don't you just work out your theory

5192.4 --> 5195.199
you might actually be onto something why

5194.32 --> 5196.5599999999995
don't you do

5195.199 --> 5198.239
anything with it why are you just

5196.56 --> 5201.280000000001
whining

5198.239 --> 5201.28
it just doesn't do it

5202.0 --> 5206.719
see so

5208.56 --> 5212.159000000001
yeah that's just how it works

5217.76 --> 5225.84
uh why'd you bring that up

5230.159 --> 5236.839999999999
what should he do what was his theory

5233.36 --> 5240.48
well he has the aristarchus theory

5236.84 --> 5242.56
that like all the celestial lights

5240.48 --> 5245.5199999999995
and then he drew it into nonsense by

5242.56 --> 5250.080000000001
saying it about clouds too is all like a

5245.52 --> 5252.320000000001
fractal-like pattern

5250.08 --> 5253.36
that derives from an origin light in

5252.32 --> 5255.44
some way

5253.36 --> 5257.28
which he thinks is at the north pole

5255.44 --> 5258.879999999999
center of earth

5257.28 --> 5260.88
that there's this giant light or

5258.88 --> 5263.6
something shining up

5260.88 --> 5264.56
or being reflected i don't know like he

5263.6 --> 5266.96
never really

5264.56 --> 5269.360000000001
worked it out but i thought it was kind

5266.96 --> 5272.08
of interesting

5269.36 --> 5274.08
and it reminded me about some old

5272.08 --> 5275.76
stories that i heard from other people

5274.08 --> 5276.08
that nobody here has ever heard about

5275.76 --> 5279.12
and

5276.08 --> 5279.12
i don't know their names

5279.6 --> 5283.52
that there was a giant tree and then the

5281.679 --> 5287.28
tree was cut down and then

5283.52 --> 5295.84
the sun the moon and the stars appeared

5287.28 --> 5295.84
in its place

5298.8 --> 5305.52
the giant energy portals well yeah sure

5302.239 --> 5307.5199999999995
sure i'm just saying i thought the

5305.52 --> 5309.679
concept was kind of interesting he just

5307.52 --> 5313.4400000000005
never does anything about it but just

5309.679 --> 5316.56
whine blabber on undeveloped theories

5313.44 --> 5320.32
it's just oh come on man i should do

5316.56 --> 5322.42
something just instead of squirting all

5320.32 --> 5325.599999999999
day long

5322.42 --> 5330.4
[Music]

5325.6 --> 5333.52
you love pj do you brandon okay

5330.4 --> 5336.32
that's fine just

5333.52 --> 5339.52
he is kind of a deviant though he is

5336.32 --> 5339.5199999999995
really creepy sometimes

5341.76 --> 5348.84
he calls everybody [ __ ] and agents

5345.199 --> 5351.839999999999
but i guess it's funny it is kind of

5348.84 --> 5351.84
funny

5360.56 --> 5367.92
right hollow earth

5363.6 --> 5367.92
no no

5368.0 --> 5374.8
his theory is not hollow earth

5371.199 --> 5377.839999999999
at least i don't think so or maybe it is

5374.8 --> 5379.84
now i don't know anymore

5377.84 --> 5381.1990000000005
pga never he says that flat earth is

5379.84 --> 5393.84
just a distraction

5381.199 --> 5393.839999999999
but he says that about everything so

5394.88 --> 5402.719
lord is the unicorn no that's not really

5399.04 --> 5402.719
it's concave earth

5402.8 --> 5410.0
hollow earth is another concept

5406.159 --> 5413.5199999999995
hollow earth is a heliocentric

5410.0 --> 5416.96
theory you know that right

5413.52 --> 5419.6
hollow earth says that the sphere

5416.96 --> 5420.8
world is hollow and not a modern iron

5419.6 --> 5424.2390000000005
core but there is a

5420.8 --> 5426.639
sun inside the ball and an inside out

5424.239 --> 5428.959999999999
world inside that's hollow earth

5426.639 --> 5435.84
that's an entirely different concept

5428.96 --> 5435.84
from concave earth

5436.159 --> 5440.48
i was very fascinated when i came across

5438.48 --> 5442.5599999999995
it the first few times

5440.48 --> 5445.04
to me hollow earth was one of the first

5442.56 --> 5447.280000000001
things that kind of

5445.04 --> 5450.0
opened the door like maybe i should

5447.28 --> 5451.0599999999995
check out that flatter thing

5450.0 --> 5454.52
what they have to say

5451.06 --> 5454.52
[Music]

5454.56 --> 5459.6
it's a very weird concept i had like

5457.12 --> 5462.239
expanding earth where the ball

5459.6 --> 5463.76
over time is blowing up it was really

5462.239 --> 5466.718999999999
small ball and then it blew up

5463.76 --> 5467.52
like really weird theories out there

5466.719 --> 5470.08
concepts

5467.52 --> 5471.120000000001
with videos and all and that was all

5470.08 --> 5475.6
throughout

5471.12 --> 5478.8
i saw that stuff like in between 2000

5475.6 --> 5480.719
eight in 2012.

5478.8 --> 5482.320000000001
i got into that sort of thing and

5480.719 --> 5484.639
fascinated just because it's like a

5482.32 --> 5485.92
fascinating new fresh idea and was very

5484.639 --> 5491.84
into that

5485.92 --> 5491.84
but it yeah was still into the ball

5498.88 --> 5502.159000000001
okay george sanford

5503.12 --> 5507.12
all right well the concave dish is kind

5505.199 --> 5509.199
of cute

5507.12 --> 5511.5199999999995
because it's not actually concave it's

5509.199 --> 5511.5199999999995
flat

5511.679 --> 5519.04
or maybe the concave dish is what the

5516.159 --> 5519.759999999999
the earth and the dirt and the water has

5519.04 --> 5522.8
settled in

5519.76 --> 5526.320000000001
maybe if you mean that the bottom

5522.8 --> 5528.0
part is like not perfectly flat

5526.32 --> 5530.239
then hey i could go with that we don't

5528.0 --> 5530.239
know

5531.04 --> 5535.6
as for the dome yeah that's still i

5533.84 --> 5540.400000000001
leave that open for debate because

5535.6 --> 5542.8
it hey what if it's looping

5540.4 --> 5544.839999999999
what if space itself loops in on itself

5542.8 --> 5548.0
yeah you don't need a dome

5544.84 --> 5550.159000000001
huh because where can the air escape

5548.0 --> 5552.88
there is no space

5550.159 --> 5556.239
the air can go to escape into it will

5552.88 --> 5556.2390000000005
just push in on itself

5556.8 --> 5563.04
and the bottom above it and

5560.239 --> 5564.638999999999
maybe some top you know i've conceived

5563.04 --> 5566.159
that in a rectangular looping earth

5564.639 --> 5569.679
there might be a flat

5566.159 --> 5571.759999999999
top literally just a ceiling

5569.679 --> 5575.84
that also loops in on itself and it's

5571.76 --> 5575.84
just there

5576.08 --> 5580.5599999999995
or there's no actual ceiling it's just

5579.04 --> 5582.56
the end of space

5580.56 --> 5585.280000000001
and it just seems like a physical

5582.56 --> 5587.280000000001
ceiling but it's simply like yeah

5585.28 --> 5589.04
after this part nothing can go there's

5587.28 --> 5590.0
no more space to go into there's

5589.04 --> 5593.04
literally

5590.0 --> 5596.8
no room it's just the end

5593.04 --> 5596.8
the end of available space

5597.36 --> 5601.92
there's all kinds of way to conceive of

5599.52 --> 5603.4400000000005
that within the rectangular or within a

5601.92 --> 5608.159
spatial non-linear model

5603.44 --> 5610.96
as it were but yeah i'm definitely not

5608.159 --> 5612.08
saying a dome it has to be like a half a

5610.96 --> 5616.0
cup over us no

5612.08 --> 5618.96
it's like why why would you say that

5616.0 --> 5620.32
if there's already weird indicators that

5618.96 --> 5622.32
space is not entirely

5620.32 --> 5624.32
linear it's not a literal disk why would

5622.32 --> 5626.239
you then automatically assume there is a

5624.32 --> 5628.0
literal dome on it

5626.239 --> 5630.08
its space may turn out not to be

5628.0 --> 5633.12
entirely linear

5630.08 --> 5645.84
that seems short-sighted

5633.12 --> 5645.84
to me right but that's just me

5646.56 --> 5650.56
expanding bar idea made sense

5650.88 --> 5654.159000000001
oh michael jones

5657.36 --> 5663.759999999999
it's so weird thinking about that back

5660.4 --> 5667.199
thinking back about it so weird space

5663.76 --> 5667.1990000000005
is fourth dimensional no

5670.84 --> 5687.4400000000005
no space is

5673.52 --> 5691.040000000001
three dimensional

5687.44 --> 5694.159
it's just that if the space

5691.04 --> 5697.6
available does not connect perfectly

5694.159 --> 5700.799999999999
linearly there may be loops

5697.6 --> 5701.6
or wormholes if you like portals all

5700.8 --> 5703.4400000000005
these

5701.6 --> 5705.679
more physical reifications of the

5703.44 --> 5707.839999999999
concept of looping

5705.679 --> 5709.92
yeah if that's present then i don't know

5707.84 --> 5712.08
how you would regard it if you try to

5709.92 --> 5714.4800000000005
model it in a literal fashion or in

5712.08 --> 5716.48
some geometrical model then you could

5714.48 --> 5719.36
say that the geometrical model is a

5716.48 --> 5721.199
fourth dimensional representation

5719.36 --> 5722.96
because it's not literally like that but

5721.199 --> 5724.879999999999
that way you can represent it

5722.96 --> 5726.0
something like that but it's that would

5724.88 --> 5728.2390000000005
be

5726.0 --> 5730.88
kind of abuse of what actual

5728.239 --> 5734.4
dimensionality is

5730.88 --> 5737.76
but yeah when it if if

5734.4 --> 5738.4
and when it turns out that space is not

5737.76 --> 5742.08
entirely

5738.4 --> 5744.08
linear yet we got a whole bunch of stuff

5742.08 --> 5745.679
to deal with mentally from that point on

5744.08 --> 5748.08
everybody will

5745.679 --> 5749.92
that's probably why they're just not

5748.08 --> 5754.84
very eager

5749.92 --> 5757.84
to go there if it turns out to be

5754.84 --> 5757.84
actual

5763.76 --> 5771.679
what vectors in matrices

5768.0 --> 5774.96
uh what

5771.679 --> 5778.639
are we talking like geomet geometry like

5774.96 --> 5782.4
interdimensional geometry stuff math

5778.639 --> 5787.92
i've i've touched upon that never really

5782.4 --> 5787.92
dug it it's been a long time ago

5788.239 --> 5791.759999999999
i did know though that it is kind of

5790.0 --> 5794.719
useful for modeling

5791.76 --> 5797.84
like computer process activities that

5794.719 --> 5799.28
they use that concept the geometry of it

5797.84 --> 5801.76
to basically help

5799.28 --> 5804.4
how processors work and [ __ ] it's pretty

5801.76 --> 5804.400000000001
fascinating

5804.96 --> 5808.32
about space and space time yeah that

5807.119 --> 5811.5199999999995
doesn't exist

5808.32 --> 5815.36
though that's just a concept fred benzo

5811.52 --> 5818.639
space-time is an unprovable

5815.36 --> 5823.04
concept it's a reification of space

5818.639 --> 5825.28
and time into separate physical entities

5823.04 --> 5829.28
that are dimensional that makes no damn

5825.28 --> 5829.28
sense there is no dimension of time

5829.52 --> 5837.360000000001
and the entire model is pretty much

5832.88 --> 5839.4400000000005
debunked it's just a concept

5837.36 --> 5842.239
so the ramone in four space it doesn't

5839.44 --> 5842.239
actually work

5843.76 --> 5850.719
no they don't use that at all at all

5848.08 --> 5852.5599999999995
has nothing to do with spatial

5850.719 --> 5854.159
dimensionality it doesn't even have

5852.56 --> 5857.280000000001
anything to do with that space

5854.159 --> 5860.239
time yeah you can note it that's very

5857.28 --> 5862.08
cute that's very cute

5860.239 --> 5864.159
if you actually try to reify that in

5862.08 --> 5866.08
reality then you are just reifying it

5864.159 --> 5867.44
into reality because it's just a concept

5866.08 --> 5870.32
it's just a model

5867.44 --> 5871.119
it's not real right we're not talking

5870.32 --> 5875.04
about

5871.119 --> 5878.0
complex like interspatial frac

5875.04 --> 5879.5199999999995
like fractal systems in math right can

5878.0 --> 5881.36
be utilized for design

5879.52 --> 5882.88
processes and all that it's very

5881.36 --> 5886.96
interesting

5882.88 --> 5889.679
but that's just mathematical processes

5886.96 --> 5891.119
based on certain structures fractal

5889.679 --> 5896.2390000000005
structures

5891.119 --> 5899.679
it's still conceptual

5896.239 --> 5900.08
yeah exactly well you accidentally drew

5899.679 --> 5901.92
in

5900.08 --> 5904.239
space time into that has nothing to do

5901.92 --> 5907.52
with it because space

5904.239 --> 5910.0
and time are not the same

5907.52 --> 5911.52
they don't belong in the same order and

5910.0 --> 5917.199
space-time is a

5911.52 --> 5917.1990000000005
just a very sloppy reified concept

5919.04 --> 5922.56
if you have a moving object there's no

5921.52 --> 5926.320000000001
relation

5922.56 --> 5929.360000000001
to it it's a mathematical

5926.32 --> 5939.84
reification time is a concept it's not

5929.36 --> 5939.839999999999
real not in physics

5940.719 --> 5953.84
let's just say it's not science

5962.719 --> 5969.76
anybody else want to address this

5966.239 --> 5981.759999999999
it's grown kind of silent chat

5969.76 --> 5984.97
besides this fred benzo guy

5981.76 --> 5984.97
[Music]

5992.84 --> 5995.84
so

5998.4 --> 6001.04
half-life

6001.84 --> 6005.119000000001
yeah half-life does not prove time time

6004.639 --> 6009.36
is a

6005.119 --> 6012.799999999999
is a concept it's not physics

6009.36 --> 6014.719
time is a concept you can't use it in an

6012.8 --> 6018.639
experiment

6014.719 --> 6018.639
because you can't alter it

6020.08 --> 6037.84
time is a concept it's not a physical

6023.44 --> 6037.839999999999
tangible thing

6038.96 --> 6051.84
all right be right back

6054.92 --> 6057.9490000000005
[Music]

6158.48 --> 6167.5199999999995
can you join me on voice chat

6162.719 --> 6170.88
that's uh i don't know you yet

6167.52 --> 6172.0
but you can add me on skype and maybe we

6170.88 --> 6174.400000000001
could

6172.0 --> 6176.159
you could come on my show at some point

6174.4 --> 6179.199
i think

6176.159 --> 6181.759999999999
i would like to

6179.199 --> 6191.839999999999
so yeah skype address is in the

6181.76 --> 6191.84
description box below

6192.639 --> 6205.84
but yeah not today

6209.13 --> 6212.359
[Music]

6218.36 --> 6221.799999999999
[Music]

6233.44 --> 6238.159
i met you at vip is it

6240.239 --> 6249.599999999999
huh okay

6247.44 --> 6261.839999999999
it must be some time ago i don't really

6249.6 --> 6261.84
go there anymore

6273.199 --> 6275.839999999999
all right

6279.679 --> 6288.159
yeah that's like over a year ago i think

6284.56 --> 6288.639
hmm interesting thanks for coming on the

6288.159 --> 6303.839999999999
show

6288.639 --> 6303.84
or in the chat

6321.119 --> 6325.759999999999
hmm i didn't know you added me

6328.96 --> 6334.4800000000005
right because i have a daily show you

6330.719 --> 6338.4800000000005
know i do this every single day so

6334.48 --> 6338.48
i'm playing world of warcraft oh dear

6338.8 --> 6345.84
well that's fine

6356.84 --> 6361.52
hmm all right cool

6361.679 --> 6366.0
i do a two hour show these days i used

6364.239 --> 6373.839999999999
to do a one hour show

6366.0 --> 6373.84
now i do two hours

6384.88 --> 6395.76
anyway uh anybody out there

6390.32 --> 6395.759999999999
want me to address something specific

6398.239 --> 6404.5599999999995
i already did an entire presentation on

6400.32 --> 6404.5599999999995
the rectangular looping concept again

6404.8 --> 6415.84
there is anything else

6416.31 --> 6419.459000000001
[Music]

6426.08 --> 6429.199
yeah by the way guys i am kind of

6427.92 --> 6432.159
noticing that

6429.199 --> 6433.839999999999
compared to say last week i'm a lot less

6432.159 --> 6436.638999999999
furious

6433.84 --> 6438.400000000001
i'm a lot calmer and i kind of like that

6436.639 --> 6441.1990000000005
and at the same time

6438.4 --> 6442.159
i also kind of miss it because it would

6441.199 --> 6444.0
just the

6442.159 --> 6446.799999999999
the ideas and the concept would just

6444.0 --> 6449.76
keep rolling it is a weird thing that

6446.8 --> 6451.04
when i have rage in me and i kind of

6449.76 --> 6454.84
contain it

6451.04 --> 6456.48
a lot more ideas tend to just pop out of

6454.84 --> 6458.639
there

6456.48 --> 6460.959999999999
so i almost kind of miss it not that i'm

6458.639 --> 6462.8
gonna artificially try to induce it or

6460.96 --> 6470.159
something because that doesn't work

6462.8 --> 6485.84
has to be natural

6470.159 --> 6485.839999999999
jk what

6502.239 --> 6513.839999999999
okay just kidding about once

6524.14 --> 6527.27
[Music]

6548.56 --> 6552.96
okay i don't really understand your

6551.679 --> 6556.8
point but

6552.96 --> 6556.8
yeah whatever

6558.08 --> 6563.119
come on guys everybody's playing video

6560.719 --> 6563.119
games

6566.96 --> 6573.76
is that what i've become the guy you

6569.679 --> 6573.76
listen to while you play video games

6577.44 --> 6580.96
i used to do that with alex jones by the

6579.44 --> 6584.799999999999
way i would listen to him while

6580.96 --> 6587.52
playing video games did that a lot

6584.8 --> 6587.52
back in the day

6589.36 --> 6592.639
oh your message didn't show up on screen

6591.36 --> 6596.08
well then you probably

6592.639 --> 6600.4800000000005
used certain

6596.08 --> 6600.48
types of words that are banned

6604.4 --> 6608.719
great twin was good it was cathartic

6607.04 --> 6613.28
qatar

6608.719 --> 6617.199
yeah i know i agree and i'm glad that i

6613.28 --> 6620.8
can be a little bit more like

6617.199 --> 6623.5199999999995
you know controlled rage just not

6620.8 --> 6625.84
complete foaming at the mouth berserking

6623.52 --> 6625.84
[ __ ]

6629.199 --> 6637.44
right yeah pedophiles probably

6634.0 --> 6637.44
i don't want to talk about that

6637.52 --> 6639.84
at all

6641.44 --> 6653.839999999999
i find it exceptionally horrific

6654.48 --> 6659.598999999999
yeah and i know they're all freaks and

6656.639 --> 6662.8
they're insane and i know how it works

6659.599 --> 6665.52
you know how pointless it is i know

6662.8 --> 6668.4800000000005
how it isn't tied in with the world and

6665.52 --> 6670.400000000001
just keep on running i just don't really

6668.48 --> 6673.36
like that subject because it just makes

6670.4 --> 6673.36
me really sick

6676.88 --> 6682.88
all right right okay all right well the

6679.84 --> 6682.88
message didn't appear

6692.32 --> 6695.84
i don't know who that is

6717.92 --> 6723.84
aj was on temple

6721.119 --> 6723.839999999999
oh god

6724.4 --> 6739.199
the buzz stories i what

6736.159 --> 6743.28
have i read any book about manly be all

6739.199 --> 6747.678999999999
well i actually have that one book

6743.28 --> 6749.5199999999995
i thought it was kind of boring

6747.679 --> 6751.36
i didn't read through all of it i just

6749.52 --> 6765.84
got like okay this is just starting to

6751.36 --> 6765.839999999999
get completely nonsensical

6776.84 --> 6781.119000000001
so

6778.48 --> 6781.119
oh god

6782.32 --> 6786.0
yeah i definitely heard about those

6789.92 --> 6793.84
i don't know what they are

6796.56 --> 6799.76
it just seemed kind of like

6800.239 --> 6807.839999999999
very very contrived like

6803.679 --> 6807.84
very artificial

6809.04 --> 6811.28
like

6813.04 --> 6816.56
maybe yeah maybe longer franz is kind of

6815.92 --> 6819.28
okay

6816.56 --> 6819.84
i haven't really checked up on that it's

6819.28 --> 6822.88
just that

6819.84 --> 6825.28
a lot of these dutch people that like

6822.88 --> 6827.599
move forward like even against bad

6825.28 --> 6827.599
things

6829.36 --> 6836.48
i trust very little people anymore

6834.32 --> 6840.32
in the netherlands i think so many of

6836.48 --> 6842.5599999999995
them have become so contrived so

6840.32 --> 6843.599
corporatize themselves and all that

6842.56 --> 6846.080000000001
that's just like

6843.599 --> 6847.119000000001
no i i don't feel like i trust any of

6846.08 --> 6849.28
these people anymore

6847.119 --> 6851.44
it's just old giant squirt fest all of

6849.28 --> 6851.44
it

6854.62 --> 6860.5599999999995
[Music]

6856.32 --> 6863.199
but yeah i don't know people change

6860.56 --> 6863.76
i don't keep track so i don't know maybe

6863.199 --> 6865.44
maybe

6863.76 --> 6868.639
they've done some really good things

6865.44 --> 6868.638999999999
again or something i don't know

6872.32 --> 6877.84
okay fred benzo i didn't know that

6887.04 --> 6891.84
like is he on youtube or something or

6889.679 --> 6891.84
what

6891.92 --> 6894.96
i might check it out

6900.0 --> 6905.199
all right okay well look it up who knows

6903.04 --> 6908.719
maybe

6905.199 --> 6909.598999999999
maybe it's halfway decent maybe it's

6908.719 --> 6913.119
just an

6909.599 --> 6919.84
another terribly contrived dutch

6913.119 --> 6919.839999999999
guy i don't know

6930.84 --> 6937.599
what

6933.04 --> 6937.599
right head burrow for occult to zach

6941.679 --> 6947.84
i don't know i'll check him out

6960.32 --> 6968.4
hmm all right

6965.52 --> 6970.4800000000005
i think i've actually seen one thing of

6968.4 --> 6975.839999999999
him one time somewhere

6970.48 --> 6975.839999999999
i bet i'll check it out

6980.719 --> 6989.84
right i'll link it up in chat so you

6984.719 --> 6989.84
guys can check it out too

6990.0 --> 6993.199
but i don't know yet i don't know if

6991.36 --> 6995.839999999999
this guy is good but

6993.199 --> 6996.32
he is with his face on video and have to

6995.84 --> 6997.92
say

6996.32 --> 6999.759999999999
my first impression is that he's a

6997.92 --> 7002.88
decent human being at least

6999.76 --> 7004.88
so that's already a good sign i don't

7002.88 --> 7005.28
know though could be completely wrong i

7004.88 --> 7008.32
never

7005.28 --> 7009.44
really dared to just say anymore what am

7008.32 --> 7012.88
i talking about yes

7009.44 --> 7016.638999999999
of course i dare to say i do it stop

7012.88 --> 7018.2390000000005
backtracking no no i think he's probably

7016.639 --> 7018.8
a decent human being from what i could

7018.239 --> 7021.28
see

7018.8 --> 7023.92
on the surface i'll check it out

7021.28 --> 7023.92
somewhere later

7026.88 --> 7031.84
hello dark steve 84.

7037.679 --> 7045.4400000000005
take a vaccine never never

7041.04 --> 7048.56
leave society uh

7045.44 --> 7051.839999999999
well how about i just

7048.56 --> 7054.88
do it another way perhaps

7051.84 --> 7057.52
make my own society take

7054.88 --> 7059.04
over society like hostile mind control

7057.52 --> 7061.599
takeover

7059.04 --> 7063.199
you know all these slaves are so weak

7061.599 --> 7067.4400000000005
they're becoming weaker and weaker

7063.199 --> 7070.96
that eventually it will be very easy

7067.44 --> 7073.598999999999
to just yeah

7070.96 --> 7074.4
mind control them like if you have to

7073.599 --> 7078.400000000001
like use their

7074.4 --> 7080.159
own paranoia [ __ ] against them

7078.4 --> 7082.32
but yeah i hope that's not going to come

7080.159 --> 7084.719
to it i don't think there is going to be

7082.32 --> 7086.159
mandatory vaccination because it's just

7084.719 --> 7088.4800000000005
a blatant

7086.159 --> 7092.08
violation of the social contract

7088.48 --> 7094.638999999999
irredeemable constitutional violation

7092.08 --> 7096.08
and there will be blood if that actually

7094.639 --> 7099.4400000000005
is done

7096.08 --> 7102.88
so they're just bullying everybody

7099.44 --> 7105.28
into like just like confirm conform you

7102.88 --> 7107.92
must want to take it that's really what

7105.28 --> 7109.92
i think they're doing because they can't

7107.92 --> 7110.96
mandate it's impossible they can only

7109.92 --> 7114.8
try to fool

7110.96 --> 7118.96
you into thinking they have to take it

7114.8 --> 7120.639
right it's just

7118.96 --> 7123.04
oh i don't need their stinking

7120.639 --> 7126.32
privileges

7123.04 --> 7129.119
i don't need my special squirt pass

7126.32 --> 7130.5599999999995
i don't want to be in the vip [ __ ]

7129.119 --> 7132.639
lounge

7130.56 --> 7134.080000000001
i don't give a [ __ ] about that [ __ ] at

7132.639 --> 7137.599
all

7134.08 --> 7140.0
i just want my organic food i'll get it

7137.599 --> 7142.32
one way or the other

7140.0 --> 7157.84
and i'll figure out what to do with my

7142.32 --> 7157.84
life on my own

7164.08 --> 7171.84
okay dark angels thanks for the tip

7182.239 --> 7187.5199999999995
right oh it's dude robin it's already

7185.599 --> 7191.1990000000005
changing civilization

7187.52 --> 7193.1990000000005
like everything is just it's just gone

7191.199 --> 7194.799999999999
from a more neutral perspective with a

7193.199 --> 7198.0
lot of willing people

7194.8 --> 7199.679
to just like a hostile indoctrination

7198.0 --> 7202.08
right really hostile level

7199.679 --> 7203.28
indoctrination with blatant double speak

7202.08 --> 7205.84
programming

7203.28 --> 7206.48
like mainstream blatant double speak

7205.84 --> 7210.400000000001
okay that's

7206.48 --> 7214.638999999999
unprecedented that [ __ ] hasn't

7210.4 --> 7214.638999999999
transpired since soviet russia

7216.159 --> 7223.04
right so

7219.52 --> 7225.92
yeah it's it's already changed society

7223.04 --> 7228.159
like that [ __ ] has changed society more

7225.92 --> 7230.639
than any potential vaccine

7228.159 --> 7231.92
on the agenda like everybody's already

7230.639 --> 7234.400000000001
screwed up by this

7231.92 --> 7235.4400000000005
it's already done damage already there

7234.4 --> 7238.4
it's gonna take

7235.44 --> 7240.08
decades to get over the mental scars for

7238.4 --> 7241.839999999999
some people

7240.08 --> 7244.08
like it's alright the damage is already

7241.84 --> 7244.08
there

7244.88 --> 7248.96
there's just a whole bunch of people

7247.04 --> 7250.639
that are now freaking insane

7248.96 --> 7252.8
and they'll probably never get out of it

7250.639 --> 7257.04
because of this what happened

7252.8 --> 7257.04
right it's just the damage already done

7264.639 --> 7270.8
you would have to sign that you support

7266.88 --> 7270.8
the nsdp what the [ __ ]

7276.639 --> 7285.119
huh okay

7282.0 --> 7285.119
take care with that

7285.76 --> 7290.4800000000005
these are tough times but look it's

7288.32 --> 7291.36
mostly just mind control attack it's

7290.48 --> 7293.5199999999995
peer pressure

7291.36 --> 7296.0
it's putting the pressure up from every

7293.52 --> 7299.1990000000005
side what they try to do is

7296.0 --> 7301.52
take away every safe place that you've

7299.199 --> 7303.839999999999
taken for granted that's the strategy

7301.52 --> 7305.4400000000005
they provide you all of this it's all so

7303.84 --> 7309.04
easy and then suddenly oh

7305.44 --> 7312.719
oh you got used to it now we're going to

7309.04 --> 7313.199
nag on every conceivable little shitty

7312.719 --> 7316.159
thing

7313.199 --> 7318.879999999999
that you like every single thing that's

7316.159 --> 7322.239
the strategy

7318.88 --> 7322.2390000000005
right so just

7322.88 --> 7327.1990000000005
it's time to reach it's time to take

7324.88 --> 7329.76
steps back become more modest

7327.199 --> 7331.119
get closer to yourself know who you are

7329.76 --> 7334.2390000000005
and

7331.119 --> 7336.719
find a way through

7334.239 --> 7338.48
self-hate yes that's a that's a bad one

7336.719 --> 7341.84
it's really tough

7338.48 --> 7341.839999999999
don't don't do it though

7342.239 --> 7345.44
you know it's a delusion it's ariman

7344.32 --> 7348.0
it's always

7345.44 --> 7349.36
it's always bad it's never good to yield

7348.0 --> 7351.679
to that

7349.36 --> 7352.96
you can experience but it's just

7351.679 --> 7355.76
frustration that

7352.96 --> 7357.36
you feel incapable right that's what

7355.76 --> 7359.679
it's really is don't give in

7357.36 --> 7359.679
ever

7360.8 --> 7366.0
like anyway i don't know if you can

7364.08 --> 7368.719
sometimes it's really tough for people i

7366.0 --> 7372.48
got i used to have it

7368.719 --> 7374.88
it was a big struggle to completely

7372.48 --> 7377.598999999999
to completely get that out it's a very

7374.88 --> 7377.599
big struggle

7392.84 --> 7395.84
uh

7399.76 --> 7409.84
right those are tough

7427.84 --> 7432.159000000001
right anyway i'm lucky enough never to

7431.52 --> 7435.1990000000005
have

7432.159 --> 7437.839999999999
that sort of like hard drug addiction

7435.199 --> 7437.839999999999
thank god

7438.96 --> 7443.44
i recently quit alcohol i've never been

7442.0 --> 7447.52
a heavy drinker

7443.44 --> 7449.119
but i was a daily drinker modest

7447.52 --> 7451.040000000001
but it still yeah can still make an

7449.119 --> 7452.159
impact and since i stopped i do feel

7451.04 --> 7455.92
better

7452.159 --> 7458.32
and yeah i do still smoke on cannabis

7455.92 --> 7459.52
but also less just started smoking less

7458.32 --> 7461.28
of it

7459.52 --> 7462.88
and that's never really been a big

7461.28 --> 7465.92
problem

7462.88 --> 7468.4800000000005
this actually seems to help me more

7465.92 --> 7470.4
if yeah when i smoke less then there's

7468.48 --> 7472.4
just a lot of benefits

7470.4 --> 7474.0
if you smoke a lot of it then you get

7472.4 --> 7477.119
kind of numb all the time

7474.0 --> 7478.239
that's yeah doesn't really damage you

7477.119 --> 7482.0
but yeah you just

7478.239 --> 7482.0
become distracted effectively

7482.079 --> 7485.36
hey secret asian man

7487.36 --> 7493.839999999999
oh nice robin stanley yeah yeah children

7489.679 --> 7493.84
without masks awesome

7506.239 --> 7512.879999999999
hmm okay

7509.44 --> 7512.879999999999
dark angels i didn't know that

7515.679 --> 7521.1990000000005
but it it would make sense though

7517.84 --> 7524.56
because that is typically the strategy

7521.199 --> 7527.04
that rehab uses on addicts

7524.56 --> 7528.96
they make you addicted to something more

7527.04 --> 7531.199
addictive

7528.96 --> 7532.32
and then deal with that so that the

7531.199 --> 7534.48
person can't just

7532.32 --> 7535.92
easily grab back to their old addiction

7534.48 --> 7539.5199999999995
because it doesn't do that

7535.92 --> 7541.36
for them anymore see

7539.52 --> 7543.1990000000005
so it's it's kind of supposed to be more

7541.36 --> 7545.598999999999
addictive i think

7543.199 --> 7547.119
that's like a strategy that's like

7545.599 --> 7549.04
officially used they make you more

7547.119 --> 7550.639
addicted to something that's not so

7549.04 --> 7554.239
easily available

7550.639 --> 7556.2390000000005
so they can then control the process

7554.239 --> 7558.959999999999
better so you can't just run away and

7556.239 --> 7558.959999999999
just go back

7561.04 --> 7576.079
that's i think the idea behind it behind

7564.8 --> 7578.400000000001
the tactic

7576.079 --> 7580.48
and it doesn't have to be nefarious you

7578.4 --> 7583.119
understand it's not

7580.48 --> 7585.598999999999
they're not it's like attacked they have

7583.119 --> 7586.5599999999995
a tactical approach to try and tackle

7585.599 --> 7588.639
with

7586.56 --> 7590.96
heavy drug addiction which is extremely

7588.639 --> 7592.400000000001
tough like it's like the psychological

7590.96 --> 7594.56
aspect it's so tough to get

7592.4 --> 7595.598999999999
people out of that that they use this

7594.56 --> 7597.280000000001
tactic because

7595.599 --> 7598.719
i guess statistically it turned out to

7597.28 --> 7600.48
be effective

7598.719 --> 7601.92
even though when you just look at it

7600.48 --> 7603.5199999999995
separate like they make you more

7601.92 --> 7604.2390000000005
addicted to another drug that seemed oh

7603.52 --> 7607.4400000000005
my god that's

7604.239 --> 7609.28
evil well if you just

7607.44 --> 7611.36
don't really think about it but if you

7609.28 --> 7612.32
realize they were using a specific

7611.36 --> 7615.5199999999995
tactic

7612.32 --> 7618.719
to try and get you off it then

7615.52 --> 7622.2390000000005
you might understand better as to why

7618.719 --> 7622.2390000000005
why they're giving you a more addictive

7630.84 --> 7633.84
drug

7639.199 --> 7647.839999999999
oh god yeah that sucks dude

7653.119 --> 7658.079
hey sleeping war is just going live

7658.84 --> 7661.84
cool

7668.159 --> 7674.4

7671.44 --> 7676.799999999999
