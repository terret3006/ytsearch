warmer despite it being very clouded

117.18 --> 121.81
yeah they did take a lot of trees from

119.979 --> 126.42999999999999
there so maybe they thought let's put

121.81 --> 131.04

that's it let's see who is in chat this

138.0 --> 147.57
Tuesday morning that one guy was first

144.58 --> 147.57000000000002
hm

150.35 --> 164.01
command-u good servant class Shaw Dorian

158.1 --> 167.1
Gray getting sick

I'm glad get a fish yeah good to see you

167.1 --> 172.819
all let's see

179.33 --> 182.05
okay

184.41 --> 188.819
what are you talking about that one guy

190.319 --> 202.79899999999998
yeah right so yeah yesterday yeah Owen

199.87 --> 206.709
Benjamin was awesome

202.799 --> 213.16
and I really liked that because it was

206.709 --> 214.44
some very dense detail things about

213.16 --> 220.599
what's his name again

214.44 --> 229.239
the comedian that's name what is it

220.599 --> 234.099
again did anybody see Owen Benjamin

229.239 --> 236.31900000000002
stream on D life yesterday his friend

234.099 --> 239.709
spent a great deal on a specific a

236.319 --> 243.04
medium played many many clips and like

239.709 --> 244.31900000000002
the guy wields a special kind of power

243.04 --> 251.26
in position

244.319 --> 254.64999999999998
socially and he always presents himself

251.26 --> 260.38
somehow to be very goofy down-to-earth

254.65 --> 263.639
yet eccentric I totally forgot his name

260.38 --> 263.639
I'm terrible

266.32 --> 269.389
[Music]

270.21 --> 283.75
anyway yeah it was very interesting very

273.75 --> 290.16
amusing also dave chappelle no no no not

283.75 --> 290.16
about him he was also mentioned but

293.95 --> 307.53
I know his face you know you can see his

297.01 --> 310.81
face right there just he's like that

307.53 --> 313.51
typical panelists guy he's also in a lot

310.81 --> 316.39
of those Hollywood roasts remember the

313.51 --> 322.45
roast off he's there a lot of the times

316.39 --> 326.59
and he's like just this typical white

322.45 --> 328.99
guy that's like looks a bit like really

326.59 --> 333.46
normal but a bit off and he always has

328.99 --> 337.18
like this very special way he he holds

333.46 --> 340.23999999999995
his face very it's kind of stoic but

337.18 --> 346.95
it's it's yeah it's interesting anyway

340.24 --> 346.95
yeah he's been around forever

347.04 --> 353.52000000000004
anyway if if anyone can't think of the

349.69 --> 357.96999999999997
name I thought it was very interesting

353.52 --> 365.71
other than that he had a flat earth

357.97 --> 370.23
debates of course did I go on something

365.71 --> 370.22999999999996
else that's let me check

375.93 --> 383.91
I don't remember if I joined Jose or not

379.08 --> 385.97999999999996
I don't remember yeah what I did notice

383.91 --> 390.66
though Oh God

385.98 --> 393.90000000000003
the so - yeah I guess it's typical this

390.66 --> 397.14000000000004
at the Davie 504 guide the base you know

393.9 --> 402.51
slap that bass it was all about the

397.14 --> 405.81
memes like oh yeah I don't know he may

402.51 --> 408.71999999999997
have done a bit of an overreach in my

405.81 --> 411.99
personal opinion but also it's kind of

408.72 --> 413.73
funny I wonder like I if he's now gonna

411.99 --> 415.56
continually do that or not he's probably

413.73 --> 419.07
just gonna watch and see the response

415.56 --> 421.83
because he's just a social experimenter

419.07 --> 425.09999999999997
that's what he feels like it into memes

421.83 --> 431.58
always experimenting seeing what he can

425.1 --> 435.45000000000005
pull off and he did this weird yeah like

431.58 --> 439.16999999999996
a CG made himself into a CGI [ __ ] like

435.45 --> 441.3
a life effect it's very odd that it

439.17 --> 445.56
looked extremely fake also by the way

441.3 --> 448.56
Davey and a lot of he called up people

445.56 --> 450.3
with video streaming using this and most

448.56 --> 454.83
of them just thought like oh yeah yeah

450.3 --> 457.02000000000004
hey Davey what it's me right I don't

454.83 --> 464.4
know it was kind of funny in a way but

457.02 --> 468.0
it's like okay I don't know maybe I'm

464.4 --> 473.03999999999996
just being a little bit too too

468.0 --> 475.17
old-fashioned too much of a boomer you

473.04 --> 485.69
know I did think it was funny but it was

475.17 --> 485.69
kind of like not epic in my opinion yeah

489.31 --> 502.669
sure Dave [ __ ] no it's not

492.29 --> 516.02
it wasn't Dave Chappelle no it wasn't

502.669 --> 526.22
even a black guy Jeff Ross

516.02 --> 529.55
I don't know no it wasn't him yeah I

526.22 --> 536.089
guess I know what you mean but this guy

529.55 --> 539.8299999999999
had hair a Jeff Ross yeah he definitely

536.089 --> 539.83
is kind of goofy

546.0 --> 551.64
No oh nice no people are guessing

559.71 --> 566.2800000000001
so I guess nobody watched Owen Benjamin

563.78 --> 570.53
yesterday because he talked about it for

566.28 --> 570.53
a long time and showed many many videos

572.18 --> 576.3199999999999
where's the Bears when you need him

587.209 --> 595.1089999999999
anyway yeah look for me hello Ben Ben

591.989 --> 598.4390000000001
saw banded for me it is bit

595.109 --> 601.8290000000001
yeah I'm noticing for myself you could

598.439 --> 604.919
call it that out my norm yes

601.829 --> 609.319
that's the guy thank you journey wake it

604.919 --> 614.639
was Norm Macdonald yes that was the guy

609.319 --> 618.029
what a character anyway yeah it's such

614.639 --> 621.359
an oddball but there's something really

618.029 --> 623.819
complex to how we wield it's like this

621.359 --> 627.2990000000001
it's almost like this guide and see

623.819 --> 629.549
through time and that's how he wields

627.299 --> 632.069
his his comedy or the comedy wields him

629.549 --> 635.97
it's a matter of perspective it's how it

632.069 --> 638.279
works I wonder if he even consciously

635.97 --> 641.749
realizes what he's doing maybe he does

638.279 --> 645.0889999999999
it in the same way that I do what I do

641.749 --> 652.6990000000001
some of the things that I do I don't

645.089 --> 652.6990000000001
really use it for comedy it's different

652.75 --> 658.779
but yeah nor McDonald that guy he's

655.449 --> 663.579
hilarious and special like he's really

658.779 --> 666.3
special like you can place it and he

663.579 --> 669.7199999999999
severely triggers people sometimes

666.3 --> 673.4799999999999
because he plays with people secrets

669.72 --> 681.1600000000001
very eloquently he's been doing that for

673.48 --> 684.16
a very long time right bomb clack get a

681.16 --> 690.209
fish yeah yeah you could say in a way

684.16 --> 704.49
that Norm his skill is is genius

690.209 --> 707.699
absolutely really Dorian Gray anyway

704.49 --> 710.529
right so now that that name is finally

707.699 --> 713.5
half comes has gone through and people

710.529 --> 717.689
know who I'm talking about it was yeah

713.5 --> 717.689
Owen Benjamin really did a great

718.29 --> 725.23
presentation pretty much some really

721.24 --> 729.25
good moments and just put down pointed

725.23 --> 730.779
at the secrets is its yeah it's it was

729.25 --> 733.959
thick thick gravy

730.779 --> 736.959
I don't Benjamin is some absolutely

733.959 --> 740.9799999999999
amazing moments and sometimes it seems

736.959 --> 743.199
like it can be so mind-blowing in ways

740.98 --> 745.48
that I almost forget about it again and

743.199 --> 747.459
but I always say I always remember yeah

745.48 --> 750.37
it's fantastic but then I just kind of

747.459 --> 754.059
forget the content because I guess

750.37 --> 758.11
sometimes it's so rich so specific to

754.059 --> 760.6
what he's doing that it yeah I can't

758.11 --> 763.4490000000001
really continue any constructive

760.6 --> 766.1700000000001
thoughts on on top of it I can only

763.449 --> 766.17
point at it

770.27 --> 783.0
all right anyway yeah right so after

779.76 --> 786.98
that at some point I started I dipped

783.0 --> 791.84
into like this huge chunk of music is it

786.98 --> 797.28
over nine hours I think it was like a

791.84 --> 802.71
giant mix of Jonah deep and yet that

797.28 --> 807.42
stuff is it's like the one of the most

802.71 --> 809.1
high tech e sound quality digital music

807.42 --> 813.36
that I've ever heard and I remember it

809.1 --> 816.66
but man they mix in some freaky [ __ ] in

813.36 --> 818.76
there it's like they're also they have

816.66 --> 820.77
so much room because of this music that

818.76 --> 823.56
they seem to experiment with things and

820.77 --> 828.11
some of these things are almost kind of

823.56 --> 835.8
freaky like rhythmic effects or

828.11 --> 838.11
dissonant effects and yeah they mess me

835.8 --> 839.9399999999999
up sometimes sometimes it literally

838.11 --> 843.0
almost give me a panic attack like I

839.94 --> 846.0
have to put that away it's like like

843.0 --> 847.91
it's some kind of oscillation effect in

846.0 --> 851.73
this in the music is getting to me

847.91 --> 853.29
even it's super super psychedelic that's

851.73 --> 855.24
basically the type of music it's

853.29 --> 858.4499999999999
classified as it's very hypnotic and

855.24 --> 862.44
it's really good for that if you like

858.45 --> 866.4000000000001
that if you have strength to deal with

862.44 --> 870.4200000000001
that so I should just turn it off but I

866.4 --> 875.63
listen to a lot of it while doing other

870.42 --> 875.63
stuff at the same time gating and just

877.26 --> 889.5699999999999
doing things chatting but yeah I came

887.11 --> 894.61
across a couple of really amazing

889.57 --> 902.13
moments in that with some like very

894.61 --> 905.8000000000001
special type of melodic harmonics like

902.13 --> 908.79
it's magic to me it's like certain tones

905.8 --> 910.75
when you combine them they're like wrong

908.79 --> 913.87
literally when you hear it it's like

910.75 --> 916.18
this is off but they put a couple of

913.87 --> 919.99
things next together where suddenly

916.18 --> 923.8
something that is dissonant become

919.99 --> 927.13
something incredibly deep incredible

923.8 --> 929.9699999999999
because of the context of what came

927.13 --> 937.65
before and every time I hear it's like

929.97 --> 937.65
what is this yet it's like magic to me

940.53 --> 947.98
so yeah music is something and magical

945.58 --> 950.4100000000001
to me it always has been but I have to

947.98 --> 953.08
be careful with it because it yeah it

950.41 --> 960.2199999999999
can also drag you down pull you to

953.08 --> 962.26
places that you really shouldn't go and

960.22 --> 965.0500000000001
I think that the controllers also

962.26 --> 969.7
definitely know that so I yeah it's just

965.05 --> 973.0899999999999
this feel that I'm pretty sure that some

969.7 --> 975.6400000000001
of these type of music editors or DJs

973.09 --> 978.19
however they consider themselves but

975.64 --> 980.59
they're pretty much music wizards is a

978.19 --> 982.6600000000001
junuh deep it's like a consortium or a

980.59 --> 984.07
group or guild whatever I don't know too

982.66 --> 986.35
much about them but I know they've been

984.07 --> 988.84
doing that for like 30 years now and

986.35 --> 992.08
they're yeah the color is just so

988.84 --> 994.51
incredible it's like kids it feels like

992.08 --> 999.61
the future but they also have like

994.51 --> 1003.24
typical alien culture influence it's

999.61 --> 1005.79
like that's and I'm just noticing like

1003.24 --> 1008.13
that whole culture and what they do and

1005.79 --> 1009.93
the types of sounds they use I'm

1008.13 --> 1015.0889999999999
starting to notice that there's

1009.93 --> 1017.79
like there's like music secrets that are

1015.089 --> 1027.329
being applied that kind of nudge people

1017.79 --> 1031.4099999999999
into a certain sound Pavlovian category

1027.329 --> 1034.53
like an a music narrative like certain

1031.41 --> 1036.48
tones can directly be associated with a

1034.53 --> 1040.02
certain atmosphere or a certain

1036.48 --> 1047.699
narrative and I'm just noticing this now

1040.02 --> 1051.69
it's and I wonder if people know it and

1047.699 --> 1054.63
if they consciously choose to do it if

1051.69 --> 1056.52
it is like sell it like personal love

1054.63 --> 1059.8500000000001
like they just believe in it because

1056.52 --> 1061.679
they love it so much or if it is really

1059.85 --> 1066.11
like yeah yeah yeah you should try this

1061.679 --> 1069.24
and that or maybe it is like yeah

1066.11 --> 1072.3
controller figures are handing out tips

1069.24 --> 1074.79
and then the people that are doing this

1072.3 --> 1077.4289999999999
just get the tips figure out like oh

1074.79 --> 1080.58
yeah okay I'll try that out and it works

1077.429 --> 1082.8000000000002
and they get the feel of it that comes

1080.58 --> 1085.74
out of it and so they stick with that so

1082.8 --> 1089.809
it's almost like yeah the program is

1085.74 --> 1093.15
handed out it's just freely taken and

1089.809 --> 1095.37
something is kind of nudged into a

1093.15 --> 1097.8200000000002
direction with barely any effort the

1095.37 --> 1100.83
only thing that was required is a

1097.82 --> 1105.78
foresight of what is happening really

1100.83 --> 1109.8899999999999
and what are the consequence of music

1105.78 --> 1116.37
and that is all that's required and then

1109.89 --> 1121.13
you just nudge and to be fair and I'm

1116.37 --> 1125.309
halfway open about this I kind of am

1121.13 --> 1129.0300000000002
trying to do that myself but it's very

1125.309 --> 1132.809
tricky it's like what do I not forward

1129.03 --> 1135.57
it I'm kind of experimenting with it but

1132.809 --> 1141.059
I just understand the consequence is so

1135.57 --> 1143.52
much more it has altered again the

1141.059 --> 1147.27
purity the frequency the path

1143.52 --> 1149.58
and you think she push forward and music

1147.27 --> 1153.3899999999999
yeah music is just like language as well

1149.58 --> 1156.0
and so in the past something that have

1153.39 --> 1158.7
typically been doing is like extracting

1156.0 --> 1163.1
really special music that just really

1158.7 --> 1167.82
placed me personally and then I kind of

1163.1 --> 1170.73
chisel it and it's always deduction

1167.82 --> 1173.25
based it's always I cut certain things

1170.73 --> 1175.44
out I'm not really a Music Mixer so I

1173.25 --> 1177.48
usually just I call it flat cutting I

1175.44 --> 1182.52
just cut one piece cut the other and

1177.48 --> 1184.98
just make it rhythmically perfect timing

1182.52 --> 1186.72
it's like a sudden switch it's kind of

1184.98 --> 1189.39
special in a way sometimes it really

1186.72 --> 1192.15
does tricks and I've done this even like

1189.39 --> 1200.25
three years ago I do it with audacity

1192.15 --> 1203.25
it's not that difficult but that way I

1200.25 --> 1207.75
can kind chisel out dissonant influences

1203.25 --> 1215.76
that that disrupt things to me and I

1207.75 --> 1220.59
wonder like yeah what can I do with it

1215.76 --> 1225.26
oh like music can truly be almost like

1220.59 --> 1232.6499999999999
an enchantment can really elevate you

1225.26 --> 1236.46
and if you yeah it's I don't know the

1232.65 --> 1240.99
music is magical and it can be a very

1236.46 --> 1245.1000000000001
powerful driving tool so I'm just

1240.99 --> 1247.14
wondering like it's almost like what if

1245.1 --> 1250.02
I was an editor and I'd really approach

1247.14 --> 1255.21
it purely as like a spiritual thing and

1250.02 --> 1258.09
kind of let the music be secondary like

1255.21 --> 1261.81
what could I do with that but I don't

1258.09 --> 1264.12
know if I if I'll ever get to that for

1261.81 --> 1267.24
now it's just cutting pieces bits and

1264.12 --> 1269.8799999999999
pieces and see how much of the magic I

1267.24 --> 1272.61
can keep and how much of the impurities

1269.88 --> 1274.5300000000002
I can chisel away and that's kind of

1272.61 --> 1277.1
what I do and I guess it might be

1274.53 --> 1281.69
insulting to some people

1277.1 --> 1284.37
but then again I guess the broader

1281.69 --> 1285.48
publications of music typically they try

1284.37 --> 1289.049
to just do it

1285.48 --> 1291.299
get all the things that most people like

1289.049 --> 1293.49
in there and I guess that certain types

1291.299 --> 1298.4089999999999
of individuals are just drawn to that

1293.49 --> 1301.08
for some reason maybe they are less of

1298.409 --> 1303.509
the intense melodic listeners and are

1301.08 --> 1306.529
more like they if they listen something

1303.509 --> 1309.869
desn't then it kind of snaps them out of

1306.529 --> 1312.149
like their natural state trance and kind

1309.869 --> 1313.9499999999998
of gets them to do things and maybe they

1312.149 --> 1317.789
would like it like that see that's like

1313.95 --> 1322.44
it's a concept it's a concept but that

1317.789 --> 1325.019
could be like one of the wider

1322.44 --> 1327.299
strategies of why they do sir but

1325.019 --> 1330.1490000000001
certain types of things that I don't

1327.299 --> 1332.07
like in the music because other people

1330.149 --> 1334.83
may respond well to that and it's widely

1332.07 --> 1337.71
known I bet that they hear out all kinds

1334.83 --> 1339.539
of people as to what they think and feel

1337.71 --> 1342.24
about their music and those people go

1339.539 --> 1344.639
all over the place they want to keep it

1342.24 --> 1346.95
very technical but I bet they're all

1344.639 --> 1353.629
very curious as to what people feel

1346.95 --> 1353.6290000000001
about their music so right

1357.07 --> 1365.75
and anyway yeah Juna deep it's it's I'm

1362.96 --> 1371.27
like the way they can edit in music it's

1365.75 --> 1374.45
like even you know how they have like

1371.27 --> 1376.85
stamps on music they put something in

1374.45 --> 1379.029
they put something in the voice to kind

1376.85 --> 1382.1589999999999
of announce the radio or whatever and

1379.029 --> 1382.94
yeah in back in the past that could be

1382.159 --> 1386.48
kind of annoying

1382.94 --> 1388.5800000000002
well they kind of now digitized and very

1386.48 --> 1391.429
carefully added these things in and they

1388.58 --> 1394.25
even do it in a way I've noticed it's

1391.429 --> 1398.419
regularly where they literally insert

1394.25 --> 1401.6
the sentence kind of timing ly perfected

1398.419 --> 1404.51
and like I can feel that it's like oh

1401.6 --> 1406.82
yeah oh yeah that's really that's

1404.51 --> 1413.179
exactly like how I would have done that

1406.82 --> 1415.8799999999999
oh so hmm yeah there's a lot that I can

1413.179 --> 1419.179
appreciate from their works even though

1415.88 --> 1421.3400000000001
it's not perfect and like to me

1419.179 --> 1424.52
sometimes it feels a little septic in

1421.34 --> 1426.3799999999999
ways but yeah it's it's a big pot and

1424.52 --> 1437.75
there's a lot of stirring going around

1426.38 --> 1442.22
in it harmonic overtone series works

1437.75 --> 1446.559
yeah well I almost don't want to learn

1442.22 --> 1446.559
about it I just want to feel it

1453.39 --> 1458.01
classically and over 20 years Wow

1462.65 --> 1472.5
now now the thing about musicians

1469.52 --> 1474.69
typically is that yeah music it requires

1472.5 --> 1477.09
skill and it requires kind of modeling

1474.69 --> 1481.3500000000001
or it's just pure intuition but then

1477.09 --> 1486.4099999999999
that it usually has its limits so

1481.35 --> 1490.8
musicians are very capable often off

1486.41 --> 1495.0900000000001
basically visualizing thinking about

1490.8 --> 1498.45
something dreamers dreamers remember the

1495.09 --> 1502.6799999999998
dreamers they even kind of said we want

1498.45 --> 1504.65
the dreamers over at NASA because those

1502.68 --> 1507.0
are the people that have a skill of

1504.65 --> 1511.0500000000002
keeping their eyes stuck on the thing in

1507.0 --> 1513.27
their mind that they've made so and all

1511.05 --> 1517.95
people that have that naturally will

1513.27 --> 1519.8
very easily be caught on the ball keep

1517.95 --> 1523.8600000000001
your eye on the ball in their mind

1519.8 --> 1525.4099999999999
that's the trick so yeah just because

1523.86 --> 1527.6399999999999
you're a really great musician that

1525.41 --> 1530.28
absolutely doesn't mean anything about

1527.64 --> 1534.38
your ability to distinguish reality from

1530.28 --> 1534.3799999999999
something in your mind unfortunately

1537.19 --> 1545.0
[Music]

1551.27 --> 1554.52
[Music]

1560.85 --> 1565.049
okay flatter spaceman

1570.45 --> 1578.5800000000002
oh that's fine both my parents were

1574.049 --> 1583.71
musicians performers even and I once

1578.58 --> 1585.48
performed two it was extremely

1583.71 --> 1594.769
embarrassing and it was stoned out of my

1585.48 --> 1604.95
mind but I perform that ridiculous

1594.769 --> 1609.6
angsty teenager thingy and it wasn't

1604.95 --> 1611.039
even a teenager can you imagine was I I

1609.6 --> 1614.1789999999999
don't know I think it was could have

1611.039 --> 1614.179
been nineteen or something

1629.7 --> 1639.3690000000001
guitar battle and why not if you got

1635.739 --> 1642.46
yeah I'm not a guitarist you know but

1639.369 --> 1645.1899999999998
that sounds kind of interesting and

1642.46 --> 1647.8890000000001
there's plenty of guitar players and I

1645.19 --> 1650.049
out to various degrees yes I guess

1647.889 --> 1651.9689999999998
everybody has to run style I don't know

1650.049 --> 1661.029
how many really good guitarists are out

1651.969 --> 1669.45
there but hey I like there's there's

1661.029 --> 1672.82
what's a hangnail I don't know

1669.45 --> 1675.279
I'm sure there's there's more so you

1672.82 --> 1677.379
could yeah you could potentially contact

1675.279 --> 1680.799
one another and and like do a funny

1677.379 --> 1685.6899999999998
video with that figure something out

1680.799 --> 1688.779
if you can find the time for it but yeah

1685.69 --> 1689.2
that I'm not gonna be a participant in

1688.779 --> 1692.579
that

1689.2 --> 1692.579
[Music]

1698.63 --> 1707.88
cool Obama cloud Gator fish that sounds

1703.23 --> 1712.34
like they figured out yeah a really

1707.88 --> 1715.3400000000001
practical way to utilize the cymatics

1712.34 --> 1715.34
interesting

1724.27 --> 1727.3899999999999
[Music]

1743.91 --> 1750.19
it would be interesting to kind of

1746.68 --> 1756.3300000000002
figure out like in what direction they

1750.19 --> 1758.56
would take that and maybe you know maybe

1756.33 --> 1762.28
I'd have to figure out more about

1758.56 --> 1766.12
cymatics but maybe I could tempt attempt

1762.28 --> 1769.09
even like it also depends on how intense

1766.12 --> 1770.9499999999998
the sound must be like how strong is it

1769.09 --> 1772.9299999999998
going to be potentially so strong that

1770.95 --> 1776.26
it could give me a concussion or

1772.93 --> 1779.3500000000001
anything or disrupt my functions but

1776.26 --> 1782.8
like but yeah maybe I could try to

1779.35 --> 1785.8
emulate that like see if it yeah well at

1782.8 --> 1789.1599999999999
least vibration could could rattle

1785.8 --> 1793.87
something now it probably takes more

1789.16 --> 1796.96
than just a bunch of testing but it's

1793.87 --> 1807.58
interesting yeah is there any footage of

1796.96 --> 1811.3500000000001
them doing that yeah did you do it's

1807.58 --> 1811.35
interesting instrument

1814.22 --> 1820.69
[Music]

1817.169 --> 1822.75
that good servant he's always been like

1820.69 --> 1822.75
that

1846.169 --> 1851.8500000000001
lately it's worse yeah okay that's a

1849.659 --> 1854.46
good point I don't know what's up with

1851.85 --> 1857.279
with John you know it could be personal

1854.46 --> 1861.1100000000001
issues that are pressing on him and I

1857.279 --> 1864.33
don't know my instinct tells me

1861.11 --> 1867.2099999999998
comparing how I even understand him okay

1864.33 --> 1871.519
because I've known other people that are

1867.21 --> 1875.429
very similar to him like from family

1871.519 --> 1879.029
friends and [ __ ] way in the past just

1875.429 --> 1881.01
fiafia and it's kind of interested me to

1879.029 --> 1883.679
just so high energy and I think that I

1881.01 --> 1886.32
don't know whatever's plaguing him he

1883.679 --> 1890.429
might just be in the need to kind of

1886.32 --> 1895.4089999999999
like get out of it for a week go into

1890.429 --> 1899.1200000000001
the bush and get wild or something or

1895.409 --> 1901.95
like get savage on something you know

1899.12 --> 1906.2399999999998
get out on the gun range or I don't know

1901.95 --> 1910.1390000000001
something to like blow off steam on a

1906.24 --> 1913.95
very heavy level because something is

1910.139 --> 1916.7299999999998
obviously bothering him he misses Randy

1913.95 --> 1916.73
I doubt it

1920.5 --> 1924.15
[Music]

1927.01 --> 1934.07
I'm not really going over to Randy's

1929.75 --> 1940.37
anymore at this point it's just so into

1934.07 --> 1941.6599999999999
the coronavirus nonsense and I just it's

1940.37 --> 1945.52
just a waste of my time

1941.66 --> 1949.5400000000002
[Music]

1945.52 --> 1953.6299999999999
like anything really interesting data

1949.54 --> 1956.0
considerable data considerably data

1953.63 --> 1958.19
worthy I'm gonna get through other

1956.0 --> 1960.2
sources anyway because yeah you can't

1958.19 --> 1965.75
get away from corona stories it just

1960.2 --> 1969.56
pops up everywhere so I don't know what

1965.75 --> 1972.26
he's been talking about but yeah

1969.56 --> 1975.56
probably this dispose it quarantine

1972.26 --> 1979.18
situations over in England and it is

1975.56 --> 1979.1799999999998
kind of like a weird situation

1999.95 --> 2003.179
what is the problem

2020.58 --> 2029.97
what you can't handle that I but yeah

2026.61 --> 2034.649
that I potentially find the concept of

2029.97 --> 2040.909
big food more plausible then then the

2034.649 --> 2040.9089999999999
virus situation yeah that's right sorry

2044.24 --> 2050.159
but yeah look the whole big food

2047.399 --> 2051.8689999999997
situation why do you always everyone

2050.159 --> 2055.369
brings it up if it's not the trolls that

2051.869 --> 2058.98
you guys I don't know why you do it but

2055.369 --> 2063.4190000000003
yeah I have no absolute confirmation of

2058.98 --> 2063.69
any of that but I'm basically open for

2063.419 --> 2070.169
it

2063.69 --> 2072.0
I think it's test worthy and yeah as for

2070.169 --> 2075.71
the viruses I just have a legitimate

2072.0 --> 2079.47
inquiry that I'm not getting answers to

2075.71 --> 2083.78
from the opposition that is basically

2079.47 --> 2086.879
what I'm sure as a rat yeah what I'm

2083.78 --> 2089.6090000000004
erecting here by bringing forth my

2086.879 --> 2092.879
doubts about viruses and yeah that's

2089.609 --> 2095.909
pretty much it and I'm not saying it is

2092.879 --> 2097.38
absolutely fake it just say I I just say

2095.909 --> 2100.1400000000003
it could turn out to be

2097.38 --> 2102.9300000000003
there's even alternative explanations

2100.14 --> 2110.7599999999998
for some of these things just on the on

2102.93 --> 2113.1499999999996
a preliminary level so I just want to

2110.76 --> 2113.15
know more

2116.02 --> 2119.0099999999998
what's the problem

2130.55 --> 2137.78
okay sorry to Cosentino I was not there

2135.74 --> 2141.29
from the start but almost from the start

2137.78 --> 2146.63
I think I joined it after like two

2141.29 --> 2148.31
months or something I started to drop in

2146.63 --> 2153.4700000000003
and then that kind of became a regular

2148.31 --> 2155.68
after after he was running for like four

2153.47 --> 2155.68
months

2216.2 --> 2227.48
all right anyway dad's eyes are all over

2221.359 --> 2232.79
the place yeah

2227.48 --> 2237.319
as a consequence so am i let's see can I

2232.79 --> 2239.18
talk about more Black Swan memes I guess

2237.319 --> 2242.7799999999997
you guys can expect more Black Swan

2239.18 --> 2249.89
memes on the flattest debates in half an

2242.78 --> 2252.7400000000002
hour oh yeah and by the way for some

2249.89 --> 2254.45
reason China has continued they're

2252.74 --> 2258.14
supposed to the backside of the moon

2254.45 --> 2260.4199999999996
landing project although it was just the

2258.14 --> 2264.5
singular piece of text it didn't even

2260.42 --> 2267.589
have any references on RT but apparently

2264.5 --> 2270.43
it is said it is declared that China has

2267.589 --> 2270.43
continued that

2279.54 --> 2284.73
anybody picked up on that anyway ads at

2282.39 --> 2291.18
this point of cares it's all fake anyway

2284.73 --> 2293.25
obviously right yeah

2291.18 --> 2296.5099999999998
Flat Earth debate is getting so much

2293.25 --> 2302.39
shoutouts recently from Eddie Bravo

2296.51 --> 2302.3900000000003
david weiss it's pretty cool

2314.11 --> 2320.9500000000003
but it also makes a lot of sense in a

2317.08 --> 2325.66
way you know because just look at all

2320.95 --> 2327.5499999999997
the flat earthers the the guys that the

2325.66 --> 2329.95
ones that have been doing this very

2327.55 --> 2333.07
seriously for some time and are like

2329.95 --> 2336.7599999999998
autumn serious channels and have a wider

2333.07 --> 2340.51
audience they all kind of built

2336.76 --> 2344.98
themselves some just directed develop

2340.51 --> 2349.6000000000004
their ideas and their insights and and

2344.98 --> 2352.77
connecting and yeah getting interesting

2349.6 --> 2355.27
stuff together and not so much on the

2352.77 --> 2358.18
psychological warfare situation it's

2355.27 --> 2359.74
like every time they do mention it of

2358.18 --> 2362.3199999999997
course and sometimes it's shown like

2359.74 --> 2366.1
yeah how mind controlling can be ballers

2362.32 --> 2368.59
get but like the really crazy ones like

2366.1 --> 2371.29
we got over at the Flat Earth debates

2368.59 --> 2374.2000000000003
and sometimes even on my channel like

2371.29 --> 2376.36
for example Brenda they kind of stay

2374.2 --> 2378.2799999999997
away from them and it's kind of sensible

2376.36 --> 2380.8900000000003
to do that because they are toxic at the

2378.28 --> 2383.11
same time Nathan Oakley has specialized

2380.89 --> 2385.69
it's it's like declared like yeah that's

2383.11 --> 2388.2000000000003
exactly what I'm gonna do you guys just

2385.69 --> 2390.91
do what you do and I'll do this and

2388.2 --> 2394.48
everybody at the Flat Earth debates is

2390.91 --> 2396.94
pretty much in that same position and

2394.48 --> 2401.26
therefore it's very logical eventually

2396.94 --> 2403.54
that like this stable setup that it

2401.26 --> 2408.2200000000003
pretty much has and forever how long it

2403.54 --> 2410.14
can last you know it all depends on how

2408.22 --> 2412.48
long the wheel stays there on all sides

2410.14 --> 2417.9
I don't know it could last extremely

2412.48 --> 2421.03
long and yeah it's very sensible for the

2417.9 --> 2423.01
guys that have been pretty successful on

2421.03 --> 2425.32
the front if their own shows and all

2423.01 --> 2428.38
that and wider audience to kind of reach

2425.32 --> 2431.44
out in a way if they feel it's reliable

2428.38 --> 2433.35
enough for whatever it is they can feel

2431.44 --> 2437.08
that they can kind of get it approach it

2433.35 --> 2440.5
because yeah they are also going to be

2437.08 --> 2445.2999999999997
confronted increasingly with the heavier

2440.5 --> 2447.28
psychological warfare attainments to

2445.3 --> 2452.01
double down on the ball

2447.28 --> 2452.01
and to confuse the crap out of everyone

2452.25 --> 2465.21
and yes it's good and I hope that yeah

2461.08 --> 2468.43
someday they'll figure me out as well

2465.21 --> 2470.65
try to approach me because I don't know

2468.43 --> 2476.8799999999997
I think that I probably feel very weird

2470.65 --> 2476.88
to them that I am very weird I guess

2486.54 --> 2491.85
yeah well Sarita Cosentino that's look

2490.11 --> 2496.05
the ballers are oh there's always gonna

2491.85 --> 2499.31
be some ballers you know because of the

2496.05 --> 2502.92
money need because of the that yeah the

2499.31 --> 2504.84
vacuum effects its in yeah they're gonna

2502.92 --> 2507.44
be drawn there to do that because it's

2504.84 --> 2511.65
like commercially viable in a way and

2507.44 --> 2515.9700000000003
it's being was it subsidized as it were

2511.65 --> 2517.56
so that'll continue on but that doesn't

2515.97 --> 2520.56
mean that those people that are gonna do

2517.56 --> 2523.92
that did are gonna be more than just

2520.56 --> 2525.54
chills for their narrative doesn't mean

2523.92 --> 2527.9700000000003
they're all gonna specialize in mice are

2525.54 --> 2531.06
just gonna drop away or not respond but

2527.97 --> 2534.8399999999997
yeah then you got the real the the

2531.06 --> 2536.5499999999997
zealous the yeah the the fund is elet's

2534.84 --> 2540.1800000000003
is Nathan calls them and it's quite

2536.55 --> 2541.9500000000003
accurate by now to call them that have

2540.18 --> 2545.96
severe Double Down syndrome and that

2541.95 --> 2550.02
specialize themselves in the lures and

2545.96 --> 2553.11
the manipulation of people using that

2550.02 --> 2555.36
lure like they have been originally

2553.11 --> 2559.1
manipulated and kind of embracing like

2555.36 --> 2561.9300000000003
that's what they're supposed to do it's

2559.1 --> 2567.81
it's pretty astounding that it's working

2561.93 --> 2573.0299999999997
like that and these people yeah they're

2567.81 --> 2578.19
really there yeah they may not be top

2573.03 --> 2580.0800000000004
down people but they they they pride

2578.19 --> 2585.36
themselves to kind of be the tip of the

2580.08 --> 2589.59
spear in the whole belief as it were off

2585.36 --> 2591.36
the ball they really do I bet and if

2589.59 --> 2593.94
they don't then I wonder if they even

2591.36 --> 2595.8900000000003
realize how much they are the tip of the

2593.94 --> 2598.26
spear of the globe religion at this

2595.89 --> 2601.41
point and that includes all the

2598.26 --> 2604.0800000000004
doublethink and all that just to how to

2601.41 --> 2609.66
strengthen the belief again in the face

2604.08 --> 2614.73
off of scrutiny and flatter statements

2609.66 --> 2616.7999999999997
and all that and the trigger words it

2614.73 --> 2619.91
yeah and therefore the Flat Earth

2616.8 --> 2619.9100000000003
debates are very

2621.089 --> 2627.25
very important because that's where

2625.3 --> 2629.17
they're the tested the most that's where

2627.25 --> 2632.619
they get the full wind and they know it

2629.17 --> 2634.69
it like even if they kind of falter and

2632.619 --> 2638.8900000000003
make a mess of things if they appear on

2634.69 --> 2641.079
there then they well they get talked

2638.89 --> 2643.72
about it's like yeah it's always gonna

2641.079 --> 2646.1800000000003
be like oh we went on that and your idea

2643.72 --> 2648.3999999999996
is really shitty or a yeah you preferred

2646.18 --> 2649.99
you did fabulous and no Nathan just

2648.4 --> 2652.48
muted you and you were totally right and

2649.99 --> 2654.2799999999997
he was totally wrong yeah I can go

2652.48 --> 2660.01
either way but you'll definitely get

2654.28 --> 2664.829
some attention so it works it's a stable

2660.01 --> 2670.75
system and it is really a good

2664.829 --> 2672.79
crossroads to zoom in on to see what is

2670.75 --> 2680.079
really at the tip of the spear of the

2672.79 --> 2681.849
globe religion in a way because that is

2680.079 --> 2683.559
where a lot of developments are

2681.849 --> 2687.069
happening and and where the actual

2683.559 --> 2691.329
approach strategies are basically

2687.069 --> 2696.0099999999998
concocted brewed up the way the words

2691.329 --> 2698.069
are chiseled out the the talked approach

2696.01 --> 2699.8190000000004
a lot of these things they're just

2698.069 --> 2701.65
experimenting with that with

2699.819 --> 2703.299
psychological warfare to see what they

2701.65 --> 2707.079
can get away with how effective it is

2703.299 --> 2709.0
and I'm betcha that is a lot of people

2707.079 --> 2712.7200000000003
watching even from the controller side

2709.0 --> 2715.359
to learn from that like hey that seems

2712.72 --> 2717.43
like a pretty effective way to construct

2715.359 --> 2723.4
a sentence in order to red herring

2717.43 --> 2726.52
somebody yeah and that's how it in a way

2723.4 --> 2728.89
also aggravates thats but they do this

2726.52 --> 2733.359
with everything and everyone it's part

2728.89 --> 2737.8289999999997
of the data leaching the machine

2733.359 --> 2741.91
learning a lot of these figuring things

2737.829 --> 2743.4700000000003
out and choosing the yeah like modeling

2741.91 --> 2745.75
what is the most effective for certain

2743.47 --> 2749.6299999999997
types of goals are bechet's probably

2745.75 --> 2753.92
done by AI that's just virtually

2749.63 --> 2761.78
figuring out the world through extreme

2753.92 --> 2763.9
modeling alright so that's my view on

2761.78 --> 2763.9
that

2786.19 --> 2790.23
Sarita Cosentino you think that rumpa

2788.769 --> 2794.6189999999997
stnos it's not a globe

2790.23 --> 2801.279
could be maybe is doubling down on a

2794.619 --> 2803.65
dream maybe he just enjoyed the belief

2801.279 --> 2805.75
in it so much maybe it saved him in a

2803.65 --> 2810.069
way gave him a purpose to continue on

2805.75 --> 2814.69
and in trouble sometime in his youth in

2810.069 --> 2818.109
order that he just he he just is afraid

2814.69 --> 2822.73
that maybe his offspring or other people

2818.109 --> 2824.65
like him won't have that glow belief to

2822.73 --> 2827.38
hold on to in order to pull them through

2824.65 --> 2831.2200000000003
and that could be seriously a personal

2827.38 --> 2837.069
motivation and it's not crazy because in

2831.22 --> 2839.6499999999996
a way I thrived on the globe but it also

2837.069 --> 2842.529
pulled me away from the world a little

2839.65 --> 2848.38
bit too much it's also it's it has ups

2842.529 --> 2852.099
and downs it's it's pretty even and yeah

2848.38 --> 2854.4100000000003
maybe that is that despite if rumpus

2852.099 --> 2856.96
would truly know it that he's defending

2854.41 --> 2859.839
just a dream then maybe he's defending

2856.96 --> 2862.089
it because he just really loves that

2859.839 --> 2869.65
dream so much any wants others also to

2862.089 --> 2871.75
be able to enjoy it really because in a

2869.65 --> 2876.13
way I have the same thing but I just

2871.75 --> 2880.059
know that I cannot do it I vowed to

2876.13 --> 2884.2000000000003
truth I cannot do it it's impossible for

2880.059 --> 2887.7400000000002
me but I can as an alternative as an

2884.2 --> 2892.1499999999996
hour our winning strategy figure out how

2887.74 --> 2897.7589999999996
to somehow devise a dual cosmogonic or

2892.15 --> 2901.809
society where the heliocentric Legacy

2897.759 --> 2904.359
and the amazing concepts of outer space

2901.809 --> 2908.38
and science fiction could basically be

2904.359 --> 2913.93
recognized as a I don't know as a as a

2908.38 --> 2916.839
culture as the original futurism that it

2913.93 --> 2917.98
really was in the first place and kind

2916.839 --> 2923.46
of

2917.98 --> 2928.78
I don't know make it like a religion I

2923.46 --> 2931.9900000000002
guess more like a religion more I don't

2928.78 --> 2934.2000000000003
know it's it's kind of how thee you

2931.99 --> 2937.9599999999996
could say how did the church was more

2934.2 --> 2942.7
secularized in in many regions in the

2937.96 --> 2944.14
world that yeah in a way it the globe

2942.7 --> 2946.0899999999997
believe could be a little bit more

2944.14 --> 2948.64
secularized and more presented as like

2946.09 --> 2951.01
yeah it's purely conceptual just be open

2948.64 --> 2959.35
and honest and and not try to hide it

2951.01 --> 2964.0600000000004
even and just let it be available for

2959.35 --> 2966.3399999999997
people to be amazed by the by yeah by

2964.06 --> 2970.119
the the astounding flexibility of the

2966.34 --> 2973.42
mind basically it could almost yeah in a

2970.119 --> 2976.09
way it sounds a bit dagger dating but

2973.42 --> 2979.78
look theme parks are pretty freakin

2976.09 --> 2982.48
amazing so it could be just become more

2979.78 --> 2986.0800000000004
an amusement concept like that more like

2982.48 --> 2988.15
a theme like wow this space thing theme

2986.08 --> 2991.359
park and the idea is any concepts it

2988.15 --> 2994.21
could be fantastical but it would not

2991.359 --> 2998.59
necessarily be the official world

2994.21 --> 3000.119
narrative anymore then and then who

2998.59 --> 3003.4500000000003
knows what could be done with it could

3000.119 --> 3006.0
be like the new form of of complex

3003.45 --> 3008.1499999999996
theatrics it kind of is already but it's

3006.0 --> 3009.41
now pretending to be real when

3008.15 --> 3013.56
unbuckling

3009.41 --> 3014.8199999999997
so I do see kind of still despite

3013.56 --> 3020.46
everything in spite of all that's

3014.82 --> 3024.75
transpired I still have a dream where it

3020.46 --> 3027.0
could be possible to not just destroy it

3024.75 --> 3032.22
book-burning situation that sounds like

3027.0 --> 3036.78
a terrible idea to me although yeah a

3032.22 --> 3039.47
lot should be corrected like especially

3036.78 --> 3042.869
how wide its influences on the

3039.47 --> 3044.79
encyclopedias and all that those the

3042.869 --> 3046.71
baseline knowledge that we should take

3044.79 --> 3048.75
from we should probably be altered or it

3046.71 --> 3050.109
should be pointed out like this is

3048.75 --> 3061.119
specifically here the

3050.109 --> 3064.3289999999997
century right but yeah I don't know how

3061.119 --> 3067.329
many people could live with that you

3064.329 --> 3070.239
know it is a religion it's very close to

3067.329 --> 3073.0890000000004
people even it's a lot of the core

3070.239 --> 3075.9990000000003
function as I described like what how

3073.089 --> 3078.519
rumpus would probably see it and then

3075.999 --> 3082.1499999999996
how I've experienced it in a way that is

3078.519 --> 3083.7889999999998
still based on the absolute suspense of

3082.15 --> 3088.239
disbelief as you're young and vulnerable

3083.789 --> 3091.9
so there may be just a design problem

3088.239 --> 3095.259
with my fish with my vision for the duo

3091.9 --> 3098.2000000000003
cosmogonic whole society the only way it

3095.259 --> 3101.91
could work is yeah if the people that

3098.2 --> 3105.1899999999996
basically chose their children to be

3101.91 --> 3111.0389999999998
allowed the belief in space and the

3105.19 --> 3116.9500000000003
dream that they would be protected in a

3111.039 --> 3121.119
way it's like but what people accept

3116.95 --> 3122.9399999999996
that this this sounds the I don't know

3121.119 --> 3125.859
is almost science fiction in a way but

3122.94 --> 3127.7490000000003
it's very conceptual now that I don't I

3125.859 --> 3132.0989999999997
don't know where this came from it but

3127.749 --> 3135.759
yeah that they would be marks not of the

3132.099 --> 3140.4700000000003
beast I hope not but basically like yeah

3135.759 --> 3142.9
this kid is being raised maybe with like

3140.47 --> 3146.2
a symbol around and like a ball or

3142.9 --> 3148.329
something on and like this kid is being

3146.2 --> 3151.18
raised to believe in the globe and then

3148.329 --> 3153.46
when he's 18 or 21 then he will be

3151.18 --> 3155.529
revealed you know like that or whenever

3153.46 --> 3157.39
the parents choose it would be up to the

3155.529 --> 3160.15
parents and then it's up to everyone to

3157.39 --> 3162.94
say like okay when I see somebody with

3160.15 --> 3165.099
that thing around their neck that's you

3162.94 --> 3171.369
don't talk about Flat Earth and that's

3165.099 --> 3174.299
just a rule a social rule see it could

3171.369 --> 3174.299
come in a work

3174.969 --> 3182.299
let's yeah this this idea is not

3178.549 --> 3187.88
completely unviable I think there is a

3182.299 --> 3193.749
chance for it anyway yeah that's my

3187.88 --> 3196.929
fuher for my the social setup

3193.749 --> 3196.9289999999996
where'd it go

3210.63 --> 3222.1800000000003
a rate of induction of the speed but are

3217.71 --> 3226.43
you saying that there is no you had no

3222.18 --> 3229.5
displacement car and is there no in one

3226.43 --> 3231.18
timeframe it's in one place and another

3229.5 --> 3233.43
it's in another place is that what

3231.18 --> 3237.6499999999996
you're saying because it doesn't really

3233.43 --> 3242.19
matter whether it is like polar Polar Li

3237.65 --> 3245.849
manifested there is a transition that is

3242.19 --> 3247.9700000000003
actually has a time factor to it it and

3245.849 --> 3251.67
therefore you could definitely say

3247.97 --> 3254.839
lights but travels of speed however it

3251.67 --> 3259.14
is conjured that's not really relevant

3254.839 --> 3264.0
whether it is anything going going like

3259.14 --> 3266.4
that or whether it is manifested like an

3264.0 --> 3269.4
electric bolt and then transverse is in

3266.4 --> 3272.2690000000002
a certain but that doesn't matter it

3269.4 --> 3272.2690000000002
still has a speed

3297.32 --> 3302.51
that's fascinating for words because

3299.75 --> 3305.6
that is yeah that is I'm wondering about

3302.51 --> 3308.0600000000004
it too but there's more I wonder about

3305.6 --> 3309.83
its yeah I even renamed the title of

3308.06 --> 3312.22
yesterday's hangout because I had this

3309.83 --> 3312.22
long

3312.43 --> 3324.0099999999998
pretty loud session about it with the

3317.51 --> 3327.0800000000004
professor Phil Bell I think and yeah

3324.01 --> 3328.7000000000003
concerning light frequency remember

3327.08 --> 3330.59
frequencies all kind of oscillation

3328.7 --> 3334.58
effect whatever that determines the

3330.59 --> 3339.01
color and then the speed of the light

3334.58 --> 3342.38
weight it definitely has and then why

3339.01 --> 3349.46
does actual motion speed in relation to

3342.38 --> 3351.4700000000003
light influence the color when yeah when

3349.46 --> 3354.59
you actually when when you would

3351.47 --> 3357.02
physically enhance the speed of the

3354.59 --> 3360.77
light if you create light types that go

3357.02 --> 3364.52
physically faster it must be possible in

3360.77 --> 3367.7
some way to just change it in a way that

3364.52 --> 3371.18
it goes faster than does the color also

3367.7 --> 3373.6099999999997
change accordingly it's just so weird

3371.18 --> 3376.46
and they call it the Doppler effect but

3373.61 --> 3381.1600000000003
I get the impression that nobody really

3376.46 --> 3385.01
understands why it works that way really

3381.16 --> 3386.18
and I'm still I still haven't really

3385.01 --> 3388.46
figured it out

3386.18 --> 3393.9199999999996
and I haven't gotten any reply any

3388.46 --> 3399.02
comment even like why does that happen

3393.92 --> 3404.02
how can that be how can speed have any

3399.02 --> 3407.98
effect on the frequency and the color

3404.02 --> 3407.98
how is that possible

3421.07 --> 3427.55
all right yeah in my mind even I could

3425.06 --> 3432.97
kind of go for it and just say okay I

3427.55 --> 3438.44
can imagine in a way that if you kind of

3432.97 --> 3442.79
compare it to polarization I guess or

3438.44 --> 3444.92
yeah like polarized glass and then like

3442.79 --> 3447.5299999999997
how one direction type of light can

3444.92 --> 3450.38
block out another and then you can have

3447.53 --> 3453.77
all these weird effects that okay for

3450.38 --> 3456.7400000000002
color is like a frequency then it is

3453.77 --> 3459.28
kind of like moving in a way I guess in

3456.74 --> 3463.79
relation to itself to its core element

3459.28 --> 3468.8900000000003
whatever it is to its energy and then if

3463.79 --> 3473.45
you move then suddenly that oscillation

3468.89 --> 3478.66
that frequency pattern would stretch up

3473.45 --> 3483.95
and therefore change the effective

3478.66 --> 3488.02
arrival of frequency now could that be

3483.95 --> 3490.2799999999997
considered the Doppler effect but that

3488.02 --> 3493.0099999999998
really makes things a little bit more

3490.28 --> 3499.36
complicated as to what the frequencies

3493.01 --> 3504.1400000000003
of light and color are in relation to it

3499.36 --> 3506.9
having at least an apparent speed or it

3504.14 --> 3510.31
does have a speed no matter really if

3506.9 --> 3515.75
you're gonna think it's gonna be an arc

3510.31 --> 3517.7
it has measurable speed so yeah it makes

3515.75 --> 3520.88
things a little complicated all of it

3517.7 --> 3523.43
see I just did it I just I just

3520.88 --> 3526.01
explained it I asked people for an hour

3523.43 --> 3529.94
about this stuff yesterday none no

3526.01 --> 3533.3900000000003
answers zero zero zero zero zero and I

3529.94 --> 3536.06
have to concoct they conceptualize a and

3533.39 --> 3538.33
conceptualize answer myself here on the

3536.06 --> 3538.33
spot

3540.6 --> 3548.79
it's hard to get progress if I have to

3545.26 --> 3553.05
answer every single question that I ask

3548.79 --> 3553.05
because I'm the only one that can

3572.49 --> 3578.3689999999997
oh really it was not an explanation a

3575.94 --> 3586.17
description really why I had to use an

3578.369 --> 3590.73
example to describe how so yeah in a

3586.17 --> 3594.3
conceptualized waiting by the way like

3590.73 --> 3598.2
how it could be explained if you explain

3594.3 --> 3601.65
the frequency like literal wave patterns

3598.2 --> 3603.7799999999997
but that's only the frequency of it the

3601.65 --> 3609.839
light frequency somehow if you consider

3603.78 --> 3614.849
it as wave patterns density it makes a

3609.839 --> 3619.349
little bit more sense why color would

3614.849 --> 3624.2400000000002
change if the relative speed in relation

3619.349 --> 3628.32
to that light would change but its model

3624.24 --> 3631.14
it's a model comparing it two ways cuz

3628.32 --> 3635.7000000000003
it's not it's the frequency the fridge

3631.14 --> 3643.3489999999997
this is only about the frequency which

3635.7 --> 3645.48
is the color because I'm pretty sure

3643.349 --> 3649.349
that the light has its own speed and

3645.48 --> 3655.02
it's not altering so it's it's roughly

3649.349 --> 3658.8300000000004
only about yeah it's really about the

3655.02 --> 3663.69
light moving that is what creates this

3658.83 --> 3665.81
color shift effect because the way the

3663.69 --> 3669.93
frequency arrives

3665.81 --> 3672.48
would ya seem to have another frequency

3669.93 --> 3675.2
because of the stretching and the

3672.48 --> 3678.0
apparent stretching out of the frequency

3675.2 --> 3683.2799999999997
because there is motion involved it's so

3678.0 --> 3686.49
odd but it's a model comparison that

3683.28 --> 3689.78
could explain the effect but it's purely

3686.49 --> 3693.8689999999997
a conceptualization it's the only visual

3689.78 --> 3697.5800000000004
comparison I could make to explain how

3693.869 --> 3700.29
it is working but I don't

3697.58 --> 3702.63
it doesn't really prove that it is that

3700.29 --> 3706.2799999999997
frequency are literally these waves it's

3702.63 --> 3708.77
just our frequency are could be

3706.28 --> 3711.38
Saturday's waves or resonation there's

3708.77 --> 3714.7
all kinds of frequency again frequency

3711.38 --> 3717.56
can be all kinds of things and that one

3714.7 --> 3720.83
kind of like works out with it but it's

3717.56 --> 3723.11
just a conceptual interpretation that

3720.83 --> 3731.21
could make it half way explainable as to

3723.11 --> 3734.09
what's going on right

3731.21 --> 3738.44
no but that's right but it's not about

3734.09 --> 3741.32
the light and it's traveling speed even

3738.44 --> 3745.82
because that is so extreme now it's

3741.32 --> 3751.82
about something else moving in relation

3745.82 --> 3753.9500000000003
to that light causing the light arrival

3751.82 --> 3757.7000000000003
and the frequencies of this light to

3753.95 --> 3761.6899999999996
stretch up yeah it's weird like how

3757.7 --> 3763.73
physical things move then because of

3761.69 --> 3767.18
that how the frequency of the light

3763.73 --> 3769.64
arrives is stretched up and therefore

3767.18 --> 3772.2799999999997
becomes another type of color it's odd

3769.64 --> 3775.97
but it has nothing to do with the actual

3772.28 --> 3780.61
travel of the lights no it has to do

3775.97 --> 3780.6099999999997
with how the light arrives it arrives

3780.91 --> 3787.69
within motion and then yeah that happens

3784.85 --> 3787.69
it's so odd

3790.32 --> 3795.57
and it is also by the way relative

3793.11 --> 3796.9500000000003
because you could this concerning the

3795.57 --> 3800.84
light that's the weird thing because if

3796.95 --> 3804.4199999999996
you put a light on a moving thing and

3800.84 --> 3808.4100000000003
something is standing still then it

3804.42 --> 3813.42
works the same the light is moving as it

3808.41 --> 3816.5699999999997
is speeding the source the light is kind

3813.42 --> 3820.4900000000002
of moving with that added on speed and

3816.57 --> 3820.4900000000002
then the same effect happens

3834.09 --> 3840.69
anyway I'm gonna round out the show now

3836.28 --> 3842.61
I hope you guys liked it I thing else if

3840.69 --> 3844.9500000000003
you did then please don't forget to

3842.61 --> 3846.7200000000003

paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

3856.02 --> 3861.3
check they'll be much appreciated I had

3858.54 --> 3863.88
some great help so far this month but

3861.3 --> 3867.9300000000003
yeah please don't think that that's

3863.88 --> 3869.55
gonna save me for like the rest of the

3867.93 --> 3872.85
year or something because it's not I

3869.55 --> 3875.25
still I'm gonna need some help but I'm

3872.85 --> 3876.72
yeah I'm doing great for now anyway I'm

3875.25 --> 3879.69
gonna join the Flat Earth debates that

3876.72 --> 3880.95
just started up and we'll be back

3879.69 --> 3886.91
tomorrow with Flat Earth

3880.95 --> 3893.6099999999997
early-bird number what is it 454 so

3886.91 --> 3894.0299999999997
hashtag meifa anyone anyone yeah Algrim

3893.61 --> 3899.6600000000003
