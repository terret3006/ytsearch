83.409 --> 94.71000000000001
weatherman it's it's probably even

88.15 --> 99.09
warmer than yesterday it's just hot and

94.71 --> 102.21
this time there's just no wind at all

99.09 --> 111.7
barely and and the wind is just as warm

102.21 --> 116.28
so yeah the spring summer in-between

111.7 --> 116.28
season has definitely arrived here and

117.119 --> 121.71

Major Tom Jeffery bill yeah right

153.9 --> 161.03
eggs yeah it's probably sunny in the

159.39 --> 165.42
whole in the whole of Europe and

161.03 --> 168.65
probably everywhere I think I don't know

165.42 --> 174.98899999999998
it just feels like this type of heat

168.65 --> 178.62
that's not just very local so it's warm

174.989 --> 181.29
it's the early summer and yeah I

178.62 --> 183.95000000000002
appreciate that so I'm gonna put out the

181.29 --> 183.95
link in chat

195.5 --> 199.79
right there we do

219.48 --> 229.92999999999998
all right though Robert gets ipis right

226.15 --> 231.79
so yeah yesterday was weird like right

229.93 --> 235.63
when the hangout started I started to

231.79 --> 237.19
get like this sneezing fits and I

235.63 --> 242.44
thought okay that's probably temporary

237.19 --> 245.14
well no no it wasn't that went on all

242.44 --> 246.60999999999999
day it was really annoying only at one

245.14 --> 248.61999999999998
point that it kind of stopped when I

246.61 --> 250.69000000000003
discovered hey wait I think I have a pot

248.62 --> 252.76
of honey and somebody in chat reminded

250.69 --> 257.83
me that honey can work against that and

252.76 --> 262.33
it did but I kind of overdid the honey

257.83 --> 265.06
and now like yeah my side hurts so I

262.33 --> 267.19
think yeah my body's not used to that

265.06 --> 273.81
levels of sugar even if it is honey so I

267.19 --> 279.46
think my not getting diabetes yet but my

273.81 --> 285.04
what's the name of the organ somebody

279.46 --> 288.419
remind me I'm gonna have to google it

285.04 --> 288.41900000000004
and google translate it

294.669 --> 302.81899999999996
yeah my pancreas that's the one right I

297.729 --> 307.12
think he he's like a little tired out

302.819 --> 309.939
being kind of painful but I've had it

307.12 --> 312.819
before it never lasts just got a stay

309.939 --> 314.8
away from sugar for a while and that

312.819 --> 319.21000000000004
part of honey I didn't finish it but my

314.8 --> 326.56
god I ate like half the pot over the day

319.21 --> 328.23999999999995
yeah it was really nice though and not

326.56 --> 331.0
this morning it seems like I don't have

328.24 --> 333.159
sneezing fits I'm still being a little

331.0 --> 335.83
runny nose every now and then it seems

333.159 --> 339.18899999999996
to thing seems to vanish at this point

335.83 --> 340.96
so I don't know maybe this day is

339.189 --> 344.639
probably like the after day tomorrow's

340.96 --> 349.839
probably gonna be gone I hope so anyway

344.639 --> 353.02
yeah also I'm gonna have I'm gonna

349.839 --> 355.65
appear as a guest on the show this

353.02 --> 355.65
evening

365.34 --> 369.04999999999995
his name we get a wait

373.199 --> 384.06
yeah Merle Beauregard yes for under nine

381.21 --> 385.49899999999997
subscribers and I don't know it it's a

384.06 --> 391.949
very free-thinking

385.499 --> 393.83000000000004
artsy channel in my opinion and he'll

391.949 --> 396.749
just see he says he just wanted to ask

393.83 --> 399.24
well yeah generally talk about where the

396.749 --> 403.65000000000003
movements going so very general we'll

399.24 --> 407.669
see I'm gonna appear there in less than

403.65 --> 413.69899999999996
eight hours from now so that's ten

407.669 --> 418.229
o'clock Amsterdam time should be like in

413.699 --> 419.55
the afternoon in the US I think so yeah

418.229 --> 421.71
looking forward to that I thought

419.55 --> 423.479
originally like oh when I when I'm this

421.71 --> 426.089
gonna be this sneezy and everything it's

423.479 --> 427.889
probably better to cancel the show even

426.089 --> 431.87
didn't earlier today but I was yeah I

427.889 --> 431.87
thought let's try it out anyway

439.59 --> 442.07
what

442.85 --> 452.09000000000003
all right that's that's just really

448.76 --> 454.42
creepy questions that don't make any

452.09 --> 454.41999999999996
sense

459.06 --> 473.82
yeah hello dust studio 68 and flatter us

464.34 --> 476.45
dude the glass ha yeah so I am open for

473.82 --> 476.45
panel

480.57 --> 488.8
nobody's joined so far up for pretty

483.91 --> 494.47
much any conversation right I could talk

488.8 --> 497.5
about some stuff been watching more the

494.47 --> 499.54
IT crowd and was amazing I'm in the

497.5 --> 502.33
fourth season now did they have short

499.54 --> 504.55
episodes it's the season but I can

502.33 --> 509.77
imagine because it's just so much detail

504.55 --> 513.99
and story is very every piece a lot

509.77 --> 516.5799999999999
happens it's it's quite condensed and

513.99 --> 519.55
yeah there were some episodes there that

516.58 --> 522.61
were just blew my mind in every

519.55 --> 524.56
direction and it's funny because 20

522.61 --> 527.2
years ago I thought it was a really cool

524.56 --> 529.4499999999999
series but more from a liberal

527.2 --> 533.1600000000001
perspective and it does have kind of

529.45 --> 539.6500000000001
like the 90s liberal progressive nerds

533.16 --> 541.8389999999999
thinking but like not as annoying in my

539.65 --> 546.16
opinion still somewhat logo somewhat

541.839 --> 547.87
natural not compared to what is it the

546.16 --> 550.66
Big Bang Theory where they just go

547.87 --> 554.08
totally overkill liberal and and baller

550.66 --> 556.5699999999999
insanity and all that and they have some

554.08 --> 560.4000000000001
of it here but they also joke with it

556.57 --> 562.9590000000001
it's like I never saw that before

560.4 --> 568.6
because I had no idea really Flat Earth

562.959 --> 570.9699999999999
was kind of stupid culturally just what

568.6 --> 574.0600000000001
the [ __ ] that series is really

570.97 --> 576.4300000000001
interesting and there was one episode

574.06 --> 583.06
that personally caught my attention a

576.43 --> 586.12
lot it was episode 1 of season 4 the OL

583.06 --> 589.75
season 4 is pretty amazing but it yeah

586.12 --> 594.04
it had involved Dungeons & Dragons and

589.75 --> 596.44
pretty pretty and like not just a bunch

594.04 --> 600.31
of retards like they it was pretty

596.44 --> 602.74
serious and it was amazing because they

600.31 --> 607.0
like you suggested like hood search and

602.74 --> 609.6
Dragons for nerds stupid but then yeah

607.0 --> 613.71
they went ahead and did it anyway and

609.6 --> 619.0500000000001
they filmed it in a really genuinely in

613.71 --> 620.9100000000001
the game way so it it was actually it

619.05 --> 622.56
was just an amazing episode definitely

620.91 --> 624.63
recommended even as a standalone thing

622.56 --> 630.06
just to see that one episode it's

624.63 --> 632.1899999999999
awesome and in so many ways especially

630.06 --> 635.31
because the ill and the other guy

632.19 --> 637.98
Roy broke up with his girlfriend and

635.31 --> 642.54
he's like totally heartbroken of it and

637.98 --> 648.4200000000001
they basically use or you think rather

642.54 --> 651.75
that the other guy mas is gonna like

648.42 --> 653.37
totally crack him like break him in some

651.75 --> 657.42
kind of revenge attempt because he does

653.37 --> 661.44
that sometimes but instead he uses the

657.42 --> 664.0799999999999
story to literally heal the guy and it's

661.44 --> 666.45
acted out really well really believable

664.08 --> 668.5200000000001
and the funny thing is that can work

666.45 --> 673.35
it's like using psychological

668.52 --> 675.6899999999999
role-playing in the game and Game Master

673.35 --> 677.4
has to be very knowledgeable about the

675.69 --> 678.09
other person and everything and really

677.4 --> 682.8
know him

678.09 --> 685.77
it's it was very rich I was seriously

682.8 --> 688.7099999999999
seriously impressed so that's that one

685.77 --> 692.46
episode after that episode 4 of that

688.71 --> 698.33
same season was even weirder because

692.46 --> 702.98
they totally made a space baller like

698.33 --> 707.22
guru cult joke a running joke with that

702.98 --> 710.13
like aw space it's so amazing it's gotta

707.22 --> 712.74
see that it's hysterical from a flat

710.13 --> 716.96
earth perspective totally hysterical

712.74 --> 719.88
so yeah episode 4 of season 4 definitely

716.96 --> 724.6800000000001
recommendation for any flattered if

719.88 --> 729.53
there's go and see that so yeah that's

724.68 --> 733.05
my review so far of the IT Crowd and

729.53 --> 736.02
yeah it's better than I remembered it to

733.05 --> 738.42
be because there's just more in it that

736.02 --> 744.18
I recognize now and understand it's

738.42 --> 746.1999999999999
incredible so that and what else did I

744.18 --> 748.79
do

746.2 --> 751.13
let's go through my history Owen

748.79 --> 754.399
Benjamin was on and he was basically

751.13 --> 758.0
saying uh Savannah Savannah a lot and

754.399 --> 759.98
that's hysterical and he was calling

758.0 --> 761.87
Erik to Bates to us a funny but still

759.98 --> 763.91
said yeah but still want to talk to a

761.87 --> 769.22
flat earther I offered myself of course

763.91 --> 772.79
in chat very directly he's never taken

769.22 --> 774.62
note of me I wonder sometimes if he's

772.79 --> 776.4499999999999
just looking at me at a distance and

774.62 --> 778.399
think I'm weird or he just has a

776.45 --> 784.87
personal dislike of me which could be

778.399 --> 784.87
because I don't know it chemistry but

785.14 --> 792.9499999999999
good would be something right little our

788.87 --> 799.61
win with like weird liberal tendencies

792.95 --> 802.22
but still also very smart nah I don't

799.61 --> 804.5600000000001
know maybe it will someday that would be

802.22 --> 807.44
really cool in a way that would be kind

804.56 --> 810.1999999999999
of a little dream come true we'll see

807.44 --> 812.72
but I wonder if there if there's any

810.2 --> 814.4000000000001
chemistry possible between us maybe if I

812.72 --> 818.12
go totally on the back tire Road and

814.4 --> 820.9399999999999
just work with his jokes which I I loved

818.12 --> 826.94
his jokes and I reg yeah I adopt them

820.94 --> 828.9200000000001
every time I can't help it yeah but not

826.94 --> 830.75
too much because they are to his jokes I

828.92 --> 832.67
don't want to just copy him that's

830.75 --> 835.43
really really embarrassing and annoying

832.67 --> 837.5889999999999
and he would not appreciate that if I

835.43 --> 841.8499999999999
did like that unless I managed to really

837.589 --> 847.97
approve upon it and so far not so much

841.85 --> 852.76
so Owen Benjamin was interesting let's

847.97 --> 852.76
see what else

855.77 --> 866.75
oh yeah left of veal Easter bombings and

861.62 --> 869.3
the Middle East in Africa always very

866.75 --> 875.27
annoying to hear that but yeah it does

869.3 --> 880.2099999999999
seem to happen every single year and was

875.27 --> 882.77
interesting he had a part like some

880.21 --> 884.96
fiafia link

882.77 --> 888.14
you always fishes out like these weird

884.96 --> 889.2800000000001
people that do testimonies and things I

888.14 --> 892.61
don't know I don't really know his

889.28 --> 894.7099999999999
sources but story it was is basically

892.61 --> 898.5500000000001
India of the opinion that it's all being

894.71 --> 900.89
done from some occult perspective just

898.55 --> 906.68
to get the Christians and the Muslims to

900.89 --> 908.33
go to war with with one another like

906.68 --> 911.0
they're being played against each other

908.33 --> 913.7800000000001
and yeah I kind of agree with that on

911.0 --> 915.98
one side but yeah there are so many

913.78 --> 919.88
sides to everything

915.98 --> 922.61
what in a sense yeah I kind of agree to

919.88 --> 924.89
that it's a good neutral perspective and

922.61 --> 935.3000000000001
just realizing okay if you can just stop

924.89 --> 938.66
the the real violent fundamentalism from

935.3 --> 940.8199999999999
spreading and crack down on that things

938.66 --> 943.37
should probably be alright and don't

940.82 --> 946.7
over generalize it with the whole group

943.37 --> 951.95
from both sides I've been trying to do

946.7 --> 957.34
that and I just agree to that so good to

951.95 --> 957.34
hear that from lift to fill let's see

957.36 --> 965.929
oh yeah Martin littke was on again man

961.499 --> 969.509
it's a huge amount of slides photographs

965.929 --> 971.3389999999999
some weird cases again we're just kind

969.509 --> 977.4590000000001
of dubious if it's photoshopped or

971.339 --> 978.899
somehow not exactly as it is it seems he

977.459 --> 980.4889999999999
has some really weird pictures in there

978.899 --> 982.529
I wonder if he put him in there or

980.489 --> 985.139
somebody else that joke with it and he

982.529 --> 989.129
is just inspired by it it is kind of

985.139 --> 993.529
interesting even if it if some of these

989.129 --> 999.23
things could be not what they seem but

993.529 --> 1003.11
yeah great photographs and just for the

999.23 --> 1005.48
paintings of buildings on the inside

1003.11 --> 1007.16
they're just mind-blowing absolutely

1005.48 --> 1012.379
mind-blowing wonder if they were real

1007.16 --> 1015.019
though you didn't get to see direct

1012.379 --> 1018.35
references where it was or anything and

1015.019 --> 1021.019
the Martin didn't mention it so yeah

1018.35 --> 1022.999
that's up for grabs

1021.019 --> 1025.069
from what I can get from the hangouts

1022.999 --> 1027.769
for Martin anyway

1025.069 --> 1030.139
and there's besides there's other

1027.769 --> 1033.679
channels too that try to get a more

1030.139 --> 1035.36
consistent narrative out of it with me

1033.679 --> 1036.98
they usually pop up after Martin's

1035.36 --> 1038.9589999999998
hangouts it's kind of like Google is

1036.98 --> 1042.38
already nudging me in that direction so

1038.959 --> 1044.269
I guess thank you google it's my own

1042.38 --> 1046.189
doing I did kind of look it up myself

1044.269 --> 1048.11
and now Google just connected the

1046.189 --> 1053.8600000000001
subject so it does that every time I

1048.11 --> 1057.5
don't know you know with Google and

1053.86 --> 1059.87
YouTube it's really a mixed bag every

1057.5 --> 1062.72
time you know they're screwing around

1059.87 --> 1065.809
and censoring and like hoarding hurting

1062.72 --> 1068.1490000000001
groups together and sometimes that's

1065.809 --> 1070.279
just really nice and convenient and

1068.149 --> 1073.01
sometimes it's really aggravating and

1070.279 --> 1075.35
manipulative so it's a mixed bag in this

1073.01 --> 1077.59
case I'm guessing like okay thanks

1075.35 --> 1081.01
Google I guess it's not all

1077.59 --> 1081.01
disadvantages at least

1083.02 --> 1097.47
right so is anybody gonna join my panel

1085.72 --> 1097.47
yet let me put out the link again

1101.61 --> 1108.4599999999998
also don't forget to share the show this

1104.62 --> 1111.9599999999998
could potentially be a long show hours

1108.46 --> 1111.96
if it's interesting

1117.48 --> 1124.74
okay and me sure

1121.32 --> 1129.55
no ballbuster just canceled because John

1124.74 --> 1132.16
fell ill so maybe he watched my show and

1129.55 --> 1134.9199999999998
my sneezing fits kind of rubbed off on

1132.16 --> 1136.96
him psychosomatically seriously that's

1134.92 --> 1139.96
how colds tend to work over it's why I

1136.96 --> 1143.92
try to Butte every time but if you then

1139.96 --> 1148.42
start to focus on it anyway yeah you

1143.92 --> 1150.3700000000001
might risk doing it so in retrospect

1148.42 --> 1152.3500000000001
technically it might have been better

1150.37 --> 1154.3899999999999
yesterday that once I got the sneezing

1152.35 --> 1158.4399999999998
fit and turned out not to and I would

1154.39 --> 1163.72
just stop the show not expose everyone

1158.44 --> 1167.13
to that but well I hope not everyone of

1163.72 --> 1170.74
you is now having a cold because of this

1167.13 --> 1174.8500000000001
yeah cold spreads psychosomatically so

1170.74 --> 1177.85
through television people are suggested

1174.85 --> 1179.6799999999998
to be sick or having colds even just for

1177.85 --> 1182.37
a joke because really cold can be funny

1179.68 --> 1184.8700000000001
it can spread psychosomatically or

1182.37 --> 1188.62
through internet live streaming

1184.87 --> 1191.32
situations yeah it's not so much the

1188.62 --> 1193.87
touch as it is seeing somebody go

1191.32 --> 1196.75
energetically through that process that

1193.87 --> 1199.2099999999998
reflex process that that rubs off and

1196.75 --> 1203.43
you catch that it's like catching a

1199.21 --> 1203.43
spirit not bacteria it's weird

1214.4 --> 1217.4
it's funny you could consider it like a

1216.68 --> 1219.559
curse

1217.4 --> 1222.3500000000001
psychosomatic curse and that's funny

1219.559 --> 1225.58
because if you then say Oh bless you you

1222.35 --> 1230.6599999999999
basically try to undo the curse I think

1225.58 --> 1235.1799999999998
that may have been an original angle to

1230.66 --> 1235.18
it that is not so nefarious

1243.53 --> 1256.05
hmm mb i-i-i don't really know how to

1252.63 --> 1259.0200000000002
directly respond to it i think

1256.05 --> 1262.3799999999999
independent variables are a part of

1259.02 --> 1266.01
quantum mechanic experiments but there's

1262.38 --> 1269.1000000000001
a lot of quantum theory that is not so

1266.01 --> 1273.18
scientific indeed in my opinion a lot of

1269.1 --> 1281.9099999999999
quantum weird theories concepts i agree

1273.18 --> 1283.8300000000002
that hello le be but yeah so conclusions

1281.91 --> 1287.8400000000001
drawn from quantum mechanic related

1283.83 --> 1291.4199999999998
experiments may not be science may be

1287.84 --> 1294.9299999999998
speculation a lot with presuppositions

1291.42 --> 1299.52
in them but the basic concepts of it

1294.93 --> 1302.3400000000001
they are there they are experiment

1299.52 --> 1308.69
tested it's just the conclusions you

1302.34 --> 1308.6899999999998
draw from them that's another matter

1322.71 --> 1330.56
yeah all right

1341.02 --> 1346.71
yeah all right I wouldn't all call it

1344.32 --> 1346.71
bull

1350.85 --> 1355.9499999999998
it all depends on what you're gonna do

1353.22 --> 1359.73
with these concepts like in a way I've

1355.95 --> 1363.48
been back engineering and trying to

1359.73 --> 1365.82
restart an approach as to what is going

1363.48 --> 1368.97
on what the original quantum mechanics

1365.82 --> 1371.399
was derived from and figure out what

1368.97 --> 1373.44
that really is from another perspective

1371.399 --> 1378.6299999999999
that doesn't dwell into this weird

1373.44 --> 1387.779
presuppositional system that's very

1378.63 --> 1390.72
calculative and all that so yeah the

1387.779 --> 1398.009
nature of lights light and electrons not

1390.72 --> 1403.23
being particles but other things and the

1398.009 --> 1406.98
divisibility of the units and I wonder I

1403.23 --> 1408.75
think I don't know with with light I

1406.98 --> 1412.46
definitely think it's an infinitely

1408.75 --> 1418.049
divisible beam as it were with elect

1412.46 --> 1421.6200000000001
electricity it seems unlikely that it

1418.049 --> 1424.009
can really be that because electrons are

1421.62 --> 1429.139
definitely a part of molecules and

1424.009 --> 1431.73
molecules are pretty specific and

1429.139 --> 1436.25
indivisible at a certain points that's

1431.73 --> 1439.98
why they are particles absolutely an

1436.25 --> 1444.629
electricity is thus more likely to also

1439.98 --> 1449.46
be a particle although look weird things

1444.629 --> 1451.83
could happen they might it could be that

1449.46 --> 1455.46
molecules that interact with electrons

1451.83 --> 1458.039
simply have a specific Elektra energy

1455.46 --> 1461.6390000000001
quanta that they interact with and the

1458.039 --> 1465.84
rest just doesn't settle in so that

1461.639 --> 1468.779
outside of molecules when free it can

1465.84 --> 1470.1899999999998
become like a soup of energy almost kind

1468.779 --> 1473.97
of like light although with lighted

1470.19 --> 1477.659
beams it just becomes a general amount

1473.97 --> 1481.5
of electricity that just is fluid and

1477.659 --> 1484.64
not quanta specific but once that energy

1481.5 --> 1489.95
is reintroduced in molecular fashion

1484.64 --> 1494.8700000000001
and then it may again start quantifying

1489.95 --> 1497.99
itself in electron units so that's my

1494.87 --> 1503.78
theorize about soft molecular structures

1497.99 --> 1512.93
and effects so far it's all theorizing

1503.78 --> 1514.55
it's but I think I don't know I think it

1512.93 --> 1515.93
makes sense at least I don't know maybe

1514.55 --> 1517.6699999999998
I'm just talking to myself and

1515.93 --> 1521.63
everybody's just looking away so being

1517.67 --> 1522.5
all sciency or whatever or look at the

1521.63 --> 1527.2600000000002
technobabble

1522.5 --> 1527.26
I don't know I'm working on it

1555.24 --> 1558.359
[Music]

1559.4 --> 1570.5590000000002
uh right guys um I'm gonna get some tea

1564.64 --> 1573.0400000000002
try to minimize the long silences it's

1570.559 --> 1573.04
not good

1577.54 --> 1584.35
so yeah I'm still waiting for anybody to

1580.58 --> 1588.37
join me pretty much up for anything

1584.35 --> 1588.37
baller would be interesting

1599.07 --> 1605.1689999999999
Voynich asked earlier how far am I on

1602.769 --> 1608.379
answering the wave unit question well I

1605.169 --> 1614.5490000000002
think I gave a pretty elaborate answer

1608.379 --> 1619.9189999999999
to that I hope as far as lights

1614.549 --> 1622.72
suggesting to be waves and particles or

1619.919 --> 1626.009
electrons neither are waves it's just a

1622.72 --> 1630.309
wave pattern like a wave function

1626.009 --> 1635.109
dispersal pattern that correlates with

1630.309 --> 1639.129
how wave functions interact so it's a an

1635.109 --> 1642.4289999999999
apparent wave the light is dispersed in

1639.129 --> 1646.7199999999998
an apparent wave it's not a way if the

1642.429 --> 1648.94
light itself is not a wave it suggested

1646.72 --> 1653.1390000000001
to be a particle and I'm saying no way

1648.94 --> 1657.6290000000001
it's an instantaneous infinitely

1653.139 --> 1660.9089999999999
divisible connection or beam of light

1657.629 --> 1663.309
that can refract potentially infinitely

1660.909 --> 1668.1390000000001
and can simply only be registered with a

1663.309 --> 1670.9289999999999
minimum quanta when absorbed by matter

1668.139 --> 1679.119
and that is how they determined a photon

1670.929 --> 1683.71
unit as for the wave function yeah

1679.119 --> 1687.789
electrons well they have the wave

1683.71 --> 1691.359
function so they say they're still

1687.789 --> 1695.34
probably part could be particles minimum

1691.359 --> 1695.34
amounts light

1696.14 --> 1701.0300000000002
that's instantaneous connection could be

1698.59 --> 1704.35
doing the same thing it could be a

1701.03 --> 1709.9289999999999
little weird yeah moving past a surface

1704.35 --> 1712.76
is known to bend light it's kind of

1709.929 --> 1715.3090000000002
maybe related to the refraction limit

1712.76 --> 1719.179
the diffraction limit affects its optics

1715.309 --> 1722.54
okay that it's an optical effect from

1719.179 --> 1729.0800000000002
the surrounding space that makes the the

1722.54 --> 1733.34
light beam split up bend within its

1729.08 --> 1735.11
function it's interesting and it well

1733.34 --> 1737.48
it's presumed to be particles but it's

1735.11 --> 1744.6789999999999
just based on the minimum registerable

1737.48 --> 1749.27
amount of photonic energy on the surface

1744.679 --> 1752.69
it is being absorbed by also yeah not a

1749.27 --> 1755.27
wave it's just that this personal

1752.69 --> 1757.7
pattern that seems to be in an apparent

1755.27 --> 1760.96
way so I hope this fully answers all

1757.7 --> 1760.96
that question

1773.59 --> 1781.48
right well you know what voyage the I've

1777.43 --> 1787.3300000000002
always wondered it's a technical

1781.48 --> 1789.16
question from me that is look I it's not

1787.33 --> 1793.3899999999999
difficult to figure out how you could

1789.16 --> 1795.64
shoot a light beam you know or suggested

1793.39 --> 1798.43
photons because that's light goes in the

1795.64 --> 1804.25
beam but electrons how the hell do you

1798.43 --> 1806.6200000000001
fire an electron that I have a lot of

1804.25 --> 1808.69
trouble imagining how that works as far

1806.62 --> 1813.1
as I know electricity works either in

1808.69 --> 1815.5
field through magnetics just is or it is

1813.1 --> 1817.53
dependent on a connection and just she

1815.5 --> 1819.97
seeks the shortest round so how

1817.53 --> 1825.04
supposedly is somebody firing an

1819.97 --> 1827.98
electron through through such a tight

1825.04 --> 1831.1
space and it not being absorbed by it

1827.98 --> 1835.66
and passing through I don't get that set

1831.1 --> 1838.4499999999998
up at all maybe it's just me I but I

1835.66 --> 1839.2900000000002
find the whole thing it feels funny to

1838.45 --> 1841.24
me with lights

1839.29 --> 1844.06
absolutely no problem imagining I've

1841.24 --> 1845.95
seen it literally demonstrated in school

1844.06 --> 1849.61
they literally demonstrated the effect

1845.95 --> 1850.32
it's very interesting so when I was 16

1849.61 --> 1856.4499999999998
or something

1850.32 --> 1859.02
so 15 but electrons I don't understand

1856.45 --> 1862.3300000000002
how that's supposed to work

1859.02 --> 1864.91
maybe somebody technical could explain

1862.33 --> 1867.1599999999999
it to me and I would figure out if that

1864.91 --> 1871.0800000000002
makes any sense or if it's some kind of

1867.16 --> 1871.0800000000002
wizardry trick mind trick

1877.28 --> 1880.3999999999999
[Music]

1881.09 --> 1885.59
traffic Tom no

1889.58 --> 1896.809
look photons and electrons are not

1893.21 --> 1902.1390000000001
theoretical but they are conceptual they

1896.809 --> 1906.08
are tying down the framework of what

1902.139 --> 1907.9699999999998
that energy is supposed to be and it

1906.08 --> 1911.33
does function in a certain way but it's

1907.97 --> 1914.029
like a presupposition of a a unit that's

1911.33 --> 1917.289
how it's functioned how it functions and

1914.029 --> 1920.21
calc is calculated does it mean that

1917.289 --> 1923.72
there's nothing there that it doesn't

1920.21 --> 1926.1490000000001
work it's just a couple of steps of

1923.72 --> 1928.669
assumption the particle thing about it

1926.149 --> 1929.299
as for graviton that's a purely

1928.669 --> 1931.249
fictional

1929.299 --> 1933.379
that's not even theory that's purely

1931.249 --> 1937.039
fictional that's totally nonsense

1933.379 --> 1940.129
so derivatives are based on

1937.039 --> 1943.9089999999999
presuppositions and non proven non

1940.129 --> 1947.379
scientifically proven things as for

1943.909 --> 1947.3790000000001
Metatron that's something else

1962.44 --> 1965.569
[Music]

1967.6 --> 1972.4589999999998
hmm

1969.669 --> 1977.429
that's interesting wit sir Watson thank

1972.459 --> 1977.429
you for looking after a definition
