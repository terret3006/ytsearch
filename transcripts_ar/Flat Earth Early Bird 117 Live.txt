11.28 --> 20.969
[Music]

27.83 --> 46.12
[Music]

41.789 --> 50.589
good morning welcome to flattered at the

46.12 --> 59.92
early bird number 170 I'm your host

50.589 --> 62.799
Arwen today's a funny day it's stormy or

59.92 --> 69.97
it just got sore me but I still feel

62.799 --> 73.21
very strong yeah bit of rain then

69.97 --> 77.649
suddenly hail it's almost like it's

73.21 --> 80.88999999999999
already April and it just barely got

77.649 --> 81.92
into March so that's kind of weird but

80.89 --> 84.93900000000001
yep

81.92 --> 84.93900000000001
[Music]

89.68 --> 96.94000000000001
that cloud just came floating over

92.17 --> 101.1
everything turned gray hail but yeah

96.94 --> 101.1
blue sky here right after that so

102.5 --> 105.53
[Music]

110.74 --> 122.56
jet-age am steve Voynich them exposed

120.369 --> 126.56
good to see you

122.56 --> 133.67000000000002
shared a show so people know that i am

126.56 --> 135.76
live i had a really good sleep last

133.67 --> 142.939
night

135.76 --> 146.87
very long manage to stay away from the

142.939 --> 150.34
alcohol again and yeah I feel really

146.87 --> 150.34
good so I'm gonna keep this up

162.29 --> 173.739
huh I'll find each I didn't know you

165.26 --> 173.73899999999998
were so close to me no idea what he says

174.489 --> 179.20000000000002
yeah I've been thinking about something

179.349 --> 187.54899999999998
sketch or something but it's pretty

184.97 --> 190.25
complicated it's very semantic also have

187.549 --> 196.45000000000002
to think about it carefully or it

190.25 --> 203.659
basically comes down to his realization

196.45 --> 207.98
that I am a raging anti Syme at yep I

203.659 --> 213.069
said it I'm an our win is an anti Syme

207.98 --> 213.069
at its true

213.61 --> 218.58
so yeah you can figure out what that

216.31 --> 218.58
means

234.299 --> 240.639
yes that's a bit of a mind twister isn't

237.219 --> 246.75
it yeah I'm an anti signer in the sense

240.639 --> 254.17000000000002
I don't like being screwed around with

246.75 --> 256.9
with sound vibrations them expose yeah

254.17 --> 261.94
you fell for it anti-semitic no I have

256.9 --> 268.44899999999996
nothing against Arab people no Simon I'm

261.94 --> 271.449
anti cymatic it's funny how it sounds

268.449 --> 274.72
like that isn't it yeah I don't like

271.449 --> 281.49
being [ __ ] around with sound and yeah

274.72 --> 285.19000000000005
to explain this for such a long time

281.49 --> 288.099
Everett every time I go to sleep or

285.19 --> 291.28
almost every time sometimes I'm just too

288.099 --> 293.32
distracted to even realize it but most

291.28 --> 296.53
of the time especially when I feel like

293.32 --> 299.11
kind of sensitive there's like when I

296.53 --> 301.63
try to go to sleep all these sounds just

299.11 --> 303.61
start to interfere with me and it's kind

301.63 --> 306.30899999999997
of weird because my mother used to have

303.61 --> 312.849
the same problem and that's

306.309 --> 315.459
talking about 20 years ago hey and yeah

312.849 --> 321.24899999999997
I think okay I got an air filter right

315.459 --> 323.349
there it's pretty old still works and it

321.249 --> 326.10900000000004
doesn't oh I got to turn off by the way

323.349 --> 329.829
for good reason because yeah I do turn

326.109 --> 333.339
it off at night because it makes some

329.829 --> 335.079
noise and and I think like ah damn it I

333.339 --> 338.889
feel almost like there's a vibration

335.079 --> 341.259
going on as I sleep very specifically

338.889 --> 343.329
when I lie down by the way and can lie

341.259 --> 346.629
on the edge of my bed or in the coroner

343.329 --> 349.029
it doesn't really matter there it feels

346.629 --> 353.199
like there's this resonance of sound

349.029 --> 356.919
going on inside my spine so I think it's

353.199 --> 358.509
that air filter again I'm gonna turn it

356.919 --> 360.479
off that's probably gonna take it away

358.509 --> 366.069
right go back to bed

360.479 --> 369.539
no it's still there so it's like [ __ ]

366.069 --> 373.53900000000004
where is this coming from

369.539 --> 375.18899999999996
hmm could it be like my refrigerator

373.539 --> 376.929
because the attic kitchen is pretty much

375.189 --> 379.59900000000005
right below me and there's like a fridge

376.929 --> 384.039
to refrigerators one freezer could they

379.599 --> 387.759
be it well yeah you you could unplug

384.039 --> 391.74899999999997
them it's still gonna be there where the

387.759 --> 394.27000000000004
hell is this freaking sound this

391.749 --> 401.22
vibration coming from

394.27 --> 406.33
and I get the feeling it's from

401.22 --> 409.24
machinery out there industrial machinery

406.33 --> 414.13
I have no other explanation why or there

409.24 --> 417.009
is some system introducing this type of

414.13 --> 419.68
vibration on purpose to screw with

417.009 --> 423.699
people especially sensitive people like

419.68 --> 430.71
me so that's that's why I say I'm a

423.699 --> 434.759
raging anti somatic it's

430.71 --> 436.289
it's some kind of noise pollution sound

434.759 --> 440.61
pollution but it's not straightforward

436.289 --> 444.24
like a speaker giving off sound and over

440.61 --> 449.40000000000003
distance it fades no it is like a it's

444.24 --> 452.13
sound waving and resonating it is it

449.4 --> 455.35999999999996
works in this very specific way and yeah

452.13 --> 457.949
we know this a little about it through

455.36 --> 462.389
what we've come to learn as a sonic

457.949 --> 465.24
levitation cymatics like if you use like

462.389 --> 467.849
setup and get like the sound wave and

465.24 --> 471.449
specific frequencies then you get to see

467.849 --> 473.4
how those sound waves exert some kind of

471.449 --> 476.52000000000004
pressure and if you tune this right you

473.4 --> 478.73999999999995
can even like lift material within this

476.52 --> 481.94899999999996
weird pressure system using the sound

478.74 --> 485.61
you can levitate it and that's under the

481.949 --> 489.91900000000004
class the technology class of cymatics

485.61 --> 493.38
and I think cymatics are being abused

489.919 --> 496.13
knowledge of cymatics is being abused by

493.38 --> 500.9
freaking warlocks

496.13 --> 503.52
that are using technology against us

500.9 --> 505.94
sounds really conspiratorial doesn't it

503.52 --> 505.94
but

507.14 --> 515.26
why why is this still here why does that

512.24 --> 515.26
work that way

515.62 --> 522.19
it feels like it's been specifically

518.48 --> 524.96
arranged everything like

522.19 --> 529.6400000000001
interdimensional arranged throughout

524.96 --> 533.95
time so that machines everywhere will

529.64 --> 533.9499999999999
have this freaking negative influence

535.99 --> 542.029
yet

538.76 --> 544.699
on one hand there is like rules against

542.029 --> 547.54
sound pollution but yeah that sound

544.699 --> 551.06
pollution is usually measured with

547.54 --> 553.01
direct loudness of sound coming from a

551.06 --> 555.3499999999999
source and yeah if it's too loud

553.01 --> 556.85
yeah they gotta somehow contain it you

555.35 --> 559.22
know industrial machines contain the

556.85 --> 563.149
sound a little but they don't account

559.22 --> 566.75
for the somatic side-effects it's

563.149 --> 568.82
completely disregarded and yeah in

566.75 --> 571.339
general if you go to the doctor

568.82 --> 573.769
complainer I'm hearing these sounds and

571.339 --> 575.12
pinpointed they're not going away you

573.769 --> 576.98
guess what's gonna happen with the

575.12 --> 579.769
average doctor that has no idea about

576.98 --> 582.8290000000001
any of this they're gonna say yeah might

579.769 --> 586.01
be in your mind you might want to see

582.829 --> 590.66
you psychologist about this and that

586.01 --> 598.13
freaking happened to my mother okay she

590.66 --> 600.85
was basically declared crazy over it how

598.13 --> 600.85
messed up is that

601.61 --> 611.99
but I think it's going on so yeah I'm a

605.279 --> 611.99
raging anti cymatic absolutely

630.97 --> 643.4300000000001
what J - your mom what does that mean I

635.21 --> 650.0
don't know right anyway morning DJ

643.43 --> 655.55
Adagio Karen be Lisa L only the Y's stop

650.0 --> 661.79
trafficking arrests I had these heroes

655.55 --> 667.37
neon noodle chocolates seein that one

661.79 --> 671.5699999999999
guy right what happened to my mom she

667.37 --> 675.26
died that's what happened to my mom she

671.57 --> 679.85
died about 13 years ago due to a

675.26 --> 683.87
widespread of influences not by cymatics

679.85 --> 688.88
not that I'm aware of but yeah this

683.87 --> 695.66
influence is so subtle yet so benign

688.88 --> 697.9399999999999
that maybe it could actually forgive in

695.66 --> 700.9399999999999
some when somebody's like a really bad

697.94 --> 705.8290000000001
shape actually topple it and make them

700.94 --> 708.9100000000001
break I don't know probably do not

705.829 --> 713.3599999999999
underestimate the power of cymatics and

708.91 --> 714.17
the wizardry with that that that can be

713.36 --> 716.779
done with it

714.17 --> 719.4799999999999
no my mom was not committed has never

716.779 --> 721.49
been committed she was way too well

719.48 --> 724.94
respected for that okay she was a

721.49 --> 728.0
teacher at a conservatory like a really

724.94 --> 737.269
good one I you don't need to time them

728.0 --> 741.35
out for that screw that guy no but yeah

737.269 --> 744.74
my mother did have this obvious in

741.35 --> 748.759
mental issues that fall in the social

744.74 --> 752.17
behavior class we yeah we were not a

748.759 --> 752.17
family without problems

754.17 --> 761.39
now Jesus

756.96 --> 761.39
I heard of elf machines they're really

764.149 --> 768.57
how do you come up or how do they come

767.13 --> 770.399
up with that she had an extra low

768.57 --> 774.12
frequency yeah maybe that's it

770.399 --> 777.93
I don't know I just know that at night

774.12 --> 781.38
when I go to sleep more than half of the

777.93 --> 785.029
times and this is throughout my life in

781.38 --> 788.279
every single location I've lived here

785.029 --> 794.55
we're at my axis it's a totally

788.279 --> 798.149
different location in my place before

794.55 --> 801.959
that in how that and at my old home in

798.149 --> 805.11
suits all of those places always I

801.959 --> 807.149
remember freaking sound interference

805.11 --> 809.69
sometimes I thought it came from the

807.149 --> 812.52
radiator system because that does move

809.69 --> 819.44
has its own effect yeah you can turn it

812.52 --> 819.4399999999999
off machinery you know but

819.68 --> 825.5999999999999
yeah it's not local not all of it is

823.8 --> 828.75
local and sometimes there's just this

825.6 --> 832.61
weird interference going on and it

828.75 --> 832.61
almost feels like there's this weird

833.0 --> 840.24
crossover between like and back and

835.62 --> 845.28
forth conversation or music just going

840.24 --> 845.79
on happening we to be something like

845.28 --> 849.99
that

845.79 --> 854.8499999999999
very it seems random but rhythmic going

849.99 --> 856.65
on in like a sub frequency so you can't

854.85 --> 861.5
actually hear it but I hear it

856.65 --> 864.2099999999999
resonating from within my spine up yeah

861.5 --> 866.28
and that's the only way you can hear it

864.21 --> 866.7900000000001
because if I basically stand up right

866.28 --> 870.72
there

866.79 --> 872.55
to stand up I kind of feel that it's

870.72 --> 874.2
still present but I don't hear anything

872.55 --> 876.27
and I don't hear it and it's only when

874.2 --> 882.1700000000001
I'm gonna actually lie down and sleep I

876.27 --> 882.17
don't know why oh [ __ ] you do

887.13 --> 892.8389999999999
okay

888.43 --> 895.3499999999999
didn't know that Oh God we need to talk

892.839 --> 895.35
sometime

896.36 --> 902.84
like I went in there's a lot of crazy

899.76 --> 909.51
stuff back in the day at happening there

902.84 --> 912.9300000000001
like weird stuff it's a crazy place and

909.51 --> 916.06
I grew up there most of my life

912.93 --> 918.8299999999999
[Music]

916.06 --> 921.14
it's like this weird village that's

918.83 --> 931.25
right in the middle of nowhere in

921.14 --> 933.08
between bigger cities if I peed at birds

931.25 --> 936.74
and animals black right

933.08 --> 940.76
well maybe 5g is just a advanced cymatic

936.74 --> 943.4300000000001
operation it's a cover for technology

940.76 --> 945.74
that gives wide range and then they can

943.43 --> 947.75
freakin abuse it as usual that's what

945.74 --> 950.33
I'd like to do give us something and

947.75 --> 954.08
then don't tell us what they can do with

950.33 --> 957.14
it to screw around with us while we beg

954.08 --> 963.71
for it that's the Warlock way that's how

957.14 --> 967.93
they do it when I say warlock yeah some

963.71 --> 971.5400000000001
people will call that Jews I don't

967.93 --> 977.5999999999999
because they're not Jews they're

971.54 --> 980.2099999999999
warlocks hiding among them they're like

977.6 --> 984.23
cultural shapeshifters they can be

980.21 --> 988.22
anything they like they can

984.23 --> 992.85
learn anything about a culture and

988.22 --> 999.6800000000001
master it walk among them and control

992.85 --> 999.6800000000001
them and they are not Jews they are not

1002.94 --> 1013.32
right and I think that yeah a wooden

1009.69 --> 1017.57
Benjamin is kind of getting getting a

1013.32 --> 1017.57
hint of this realizing figuring this app

1030.3 --> 1037.19
anyway yeah I'm not anti-semitic

1033.29 --> 1040.249
absolutely not I'm anti somatic

1037.19 --> 1040.249
[Music]

1043.19 --> 1049.4
but although yeah I am not anti somatic

1046.07 --> 1052.85
in the sense of the word of God which

1049.4 --> 1060.41
falls kind of under cymatics I'm rather

1052.85 --> 1065.32
under I'm against humans abusing the

1060.41 --> 1065.3200000000002
power of God cymatics

1072.28 --> 1074.85
yeah

1083.029 --> 1090.84
right alright and it's not just they

1087.24 --> 1094.409
don't just hide among Jews although yeah

1090.84 --> 1099.9499999999998
they they do like the Jews because they

1094.409 --> 1104.7890000000002
are such they have like these tight

1099.95 --> 1107.309
loyalty among their culture and the

1104.789 --> 1110.19
Warlocks really like to abuse that to

1107.309 --> 1113.61
the full but they're there among other

1110.19 --> 1116.1100000000001
groups as well I know it I know they are

1113.61 --> 1119.1399999999999
and they're not really

1116.11 --> 1119.1399999999999
[Music]

1119.33 --> 1124.799
racially bound or anything although

1121.74 --> 1128.84
there are they do screw around with that

1124.799 --> 1133.44
and lot lines and [ __ ] to play into that

1128.84 --> 1137.51
but they yeah it's all about the method

1133.44 --> 1141.47
it's all about going against logos

1137.51 --> 1144.33
that's that's what they are

1141.47 --> 1145.57
they hide among us

1144.33 --> 1149.37
[Music]

1145.57 --> 1149.37
and you will know them by their methods

1150.9 --> 1154.209
[Music]

1154.35 --> 1161.07
right some certainly yeah and [ __ ] you

1158.8 --> 1165.34
it's not even Zionism okay

1161.07 --> 1168.28
although ya bet like among the whole

1165.34 --> 1171.6999999999998
Zionist concept there are probably a

1168.28 --> 1175.77
couple of warlocks in there controlling

1171.7 --> 1179.76
it does seem to be part of their plan

1175.77 --> 1183.07
yeah or they're riding along that plan

1179.76 --> 1186.7
but it they're always on the other side

1183.07 --> 1189.22
they're always they're never in the open

1186.7 --> 1193.27
they always take some other plan that

1189.22 --> 1198.3700000000001
other people ride along with and then be

1193.27 --> 1201.91
in the under layer using that structure

1198.37 --> 1206.4699999999998
if that's out in the open to do their

1201.91 --> 1208.75
secret [ __ ] that's what they do that's

1206.47 --> 1211.32
what the warlocks do do it in secret

1208.75 --> 1211.32
always

1217.34 --> 1220.12
it's

1224.17 --> 1227.189
[Music]

1229.05 --> 1232.05
right

1232.71 --> 1235.749
[Music]

1236.01 --> 1241.21
right yeah that one guy asks do you have

1238.75 --> 1245.799
all dental filling works I think and

1241.21 --> 1249.28
such that could yeah I do have it but

1245.799 --> 1252.07
it's not the cause and I tested this I

1249.28 --> 1256.21
tested them they have no negative

1252.07 --> 1258.49
influence on me they could but yeah with

1256.21 --> 1262.75
some people they do but with me

1258.49 --> 1264.85
they don't so yeah I had been thinking

1262.75 --> 1268.799
of getting them removed and everything

1264.85 --> 1271.9289999999999
but that's quite a drastic operation and

1268.799 --> 1274.45
can't pay for that for starters and it

1271.929 --> 1276.8500000000001
doesn't seem to be necessary for my

1274.45 --> 1279.28
health or anything it's not like I'm

1276.85 --> 1281.83
getting radio signals through there no

1279.28 --> 1283.72
it's it's not about that it's not about

1281.83 --> 1284.83
something metal picking it up it's not a

1283.72 --> 1292.23
radio effect

1284.83 --> 1296.61
it's cymatics its sound waves resonating

1292.23 --> 1302.01
throughout everything and it rides on

1296.61 --> 1304.84
structures on confines and uses that to

1302.01 --> 1307.72
to spread out resonance

1304.84 --> 1310.53
it's a resonance effect cymatics it's

1307.72 --> 1312.99
not straightforward sound

1310.53 --> 1316.08
like a guitar it kind of is like a snare

1312.99 --> 1318.68
effect but it's not just amplitude all

1316.08 --> 1321.51
sounds projection like from a speaker

1318.68 --> 1323.46
that's not the same that that diminishes

1321.51 --> 1329.1299999999999
over distance no it's the resonating

1323.46 --> 1333.0900000000001
thing it's like a guitar as you call the

1329.13 --> 1336.5400000000002
box getting the name wrong that's what

1333.09 --> 1339.2099999999998
actually the snare makes the box

1336.54 --> 1343.74
resonate and that's what's producing the

1339.21 --> 1347.25
sound that that's tech technology so

1343.74 --> 1352.79
it's all about resonance resonance of

1347.25 --> 1352.79
shapes vibration

1357.67 --> 1360.699
[Music]

1364.84 --> 1371.48
yes joke let's say no I'm not picking up

1367.88 --> 1373.19
MTV my mouth thank God no no I'm not

1371.48 --> 1377.03
picking up anything in my mouth really

1373.19 --> 1379.22
it really comes where I pick this [ __ ]

1377.03 --> 1384.83
up then really annoys the [ __ ] out of me

1379.22 --> 1386.8700000000001
is in my spine and I hear it through my

1384.83 --> 1388.52
spine is connected to my skull I hear it

1386.87 --> 1391.79
through the base of my skull

1388.52 --> 1397.19
just as there are like hearing aids you

1391.79 --> 1399.71
can put um and then hear [ __ ] that's how

1397.19 --> 1402.3200000000002
I perceive it that's how I hear it but

1399.71 --> 1405.28
first foremost I feel it I just feel

1402.32 --> 1410.09
that if something is going on there and

1405.28 --> 1413.42
it's not like some muscle spasm thing no

1410.09 --> 1415.76
it's externally projected in there you

1413.42 --> 1421.6100000000001
can hear it resonate and it's really

1415.76 --> 1425.78
distracting and as like a nervous tint

1421.61 --> 1432.4599999999998
to it it's not good so yeah i'm anti

1425.78 --> 1438.28
somatic on record you know go rest me

1432.46 --> 1438.28
yep Arwen is an anti somatic guy

1448.49 --> 1455.23
yeah mercury recen jur that is actually

1452.3 --> 1459.1399999999999
a thing people have complained about

1455.23 --> 1462.23
hearing radio or [ __ ] through their

1459.14 --> 1464.0900000000001
feelings because yeah although that's

1462.23 --> 1469.0
probably more likely when you're like

1464.09 --> 1473.27
right next to a radio station or some

1469.0 --> 1475.4
heavy projecting Wi-Fi hub or something

1473.27 --> 1476.98
yeah you might typically get that kind

1475.4 --> 1479.5400000000002
of [ __ ]

1476.98 --> 1482.15
yeah bill gee that's a good one Erwin is

1479.54 --> 1486.74
a tuning fork to reality yeah I like to

1482.15 --> 1491.5700000000002
think so definitely and I think yeah

1486.74 --> 1497.27
most humans are in a way it's all about

1491.57 --> 1500.4399999999998
the sensitivity more sensitive you

1497.27 --> 1504.35
become the more you will pick up the

1500.44 --> 1507.1100000000001
subtleties what's out there and what is

1504.35 --> 1510.35
out there is a lot it reaches into the

1507.11 --> 1514.4599999999998
into the extra dimensions even and I'm

1510.35 --> 1518.27
thinking I'm thinking like what if this

1514.46 --> 1519.95
cymatics problem could be solved somehow

1518.27 --> 1523.19
it's probably not gonna be

1519.95 --> 1525.38
straightforward but what if just man

1523.19 --> 1529.42
what if that wasn't there I think that

1525.38 --> 1534.0500000000002
the calm of it would allow me to engage

1529.42 --> 1536.66
in activity during my sleep that would

1534.05 --> 1540.1599999999999
allow me more grip over things I might

1536.66 --> 1540.16
actually be able to just

1540.41 --> 1547.1000000000001
have much clearer dreams with more

1543.83 --> 1549.4399999999998
control in it maybe even naturally enter

1547.1 --> 1551.8999999999999
the dark world and do stuff there

1549.44 --> 1554.8700000000001
without using anything I think it's

1551.9 --> 1558.89
there actually to disrupt it and I might

1554.87 --> 1561.35
not be the only one that's that that is

1558.89 --> 1564.47
supposed to suppress think it might be

1561.35 --> 1567.9199999999998
there specifically for that to suppress

1564.47 --> 1575.21
our interaction with the other dimension

1567.92 --> 1577.73
the natural interaction to weaken us so

1575.21 --> 1580.97
but that's yeah it's kind of speculation

1577.73 --> 1584.14
in that sense I have to feel that have

1580.97 --> 1584.14
to notice the contrast

1586.65 --> 1592.2
but for example it would be interesting

1588.78 --> 1594.66
to try sometimes to go and sleep in a

1592.2 --> 1596.8700000000001
perfect Faraday cage would that help

1594.66 --> 1600.27
would that prevent the somatic or a

1596.87 --> 1604.32
perfect perfect soundproof room like a

1600.27 --> 1607.2
studio room with the foam thing that

1604.32 --> 1612.03
absorbs sound everywhere would that

1607.2 --> 1614.67
prevent the cymatics would that prevent

1612.03 --> 1619.55
via the interruption I would like to

1614.67 --> 1619.5500000000002
test it and see if that will work

1627.429 --> 1639.719
Oh retract your message goodbye don't do

1636.879 --> 1639.7189999999998
that [ __ ] dude

1648.019 --> 1657.289
yeah oh and sorry Rasta it's gonna be

1652.37 --> 1660.7199999999998
another foods of you Illuminati cuz I

1657.289 --> 1665.6
know it's not a cooking video it's not a

1660.72 --> 1665.6000000000001
food video I just have breakfast okay

1665.659 --> 1678.0900000000001
I'm a human being I need to eat oh by

1675.299 --> 1681.629
the way yeah I might be in such an

1678.09 --> 1684.899
uplifting mood today not because I am

1681.629 --> 1689.039
finally able to openly declare I am anti

1684.899 --> 1692.37
somatic but because I'm getting a new

1689.039 --> 1695.19
microphone probably tomorrow a really

1692.37 --> 1698.37
good one so the shitty are we nyan noise

1695.19 --> 1701.3890000000001
is gonna go away and be replaced by good

1698.37 --> 1707.9599999999998
sound and at the same time the same day

1701.389 --> 1711.5089999999998
I'm getting my new pants love it finally

1707.96 --> 1713.549
so it's a good time for me and also yeah

1711.509 --> 1716.509
it's just yesterday in general there

1713.549 --> 1716.509
were so many good things

1717.25 --> 1722.59
friends being supportive getting the

1720.61 --> 1725.1999999999998
microphone getting knowing I'm getting

1722.59 --> 1727.539
my pants and I fixed that window all by

1725.2 --> 1730.3300000000002
myself and like ever all my roommates

1727.539 --> 1732.19
all were like by their own volition like

1730.33 --> 1734.9189999999999
oh yeah you did a really good job we

1732.19 --> 1738.6000000000001
didn't even see it was broken in the

1734.919 --> 1742.69
first place so yeah I'm I did a lot and

1738.6 --> 1745.6899999999998
doing stuff being occupied with creative

1742.69 --> 1749.65
useful stuff is really good for me my

1745.69 --> 1753.1000000000001
biggest problem is that I don't do

1749.65 --> 1757.45
enough things it's really a big problem

1753.1 --> 1759.8799999999999
I should be doing more it's like the one

1757.45 --> 1762.549
advantage of getting a shitty job is

1759.88 --> 1765.159
that I got stuff to do only problem is

1762.549 --> 1767.47
if that shitty job is just waiting

1765.159 --> 1769.69
around or doing totally boring stuff

1767.47 --> 1773.71
that's not gonna help that's actually

1769.69 --> 1777.94
gonna reverse help and kill me because I

1773.71 --> 1780.13
hate doing useless [ __ ] but and that at

1777.94 --> 1782.98
the same time hating you doing useless

1780.13 --> 1786.48
[ __ ] is also what causes me not to do a

1782.98 --> 1789.1
lot of stuff all the time because I just

1786.48 --> 1791.95
want to be original I want to do it

1789.1 --> 1794.35
right I want to do it the one thing in

1791.95 --> 1797.6200000000001
the right time that has the most effect

1794.35 --> 1800.1399999999999
but yeah that causes me to have a lot of

1797.62 --> 1802.059
space on a breathing room and eventually

1800.14 --> 1805.179
that breathing room and space becomes

1802.059 --> 1809.95
too much and it starts to unnerve me and

1805.179 --> 1812.3100000000002
haunt me and that seems to be a theme

1809.95 --> 1814.6200000000001
throughout my life

1812.31 --> 1819.1499999999999
it's weird how that works but anything

1814.62 --> 1825.54
anyway yeah

1819.15 --> 1831.99
again harsh a I'm not anti Simon

1825.54 --> 1842.58
semantics right I'm anti cymatic it's

1831.99 --> 1845.19
with the C Y M a TI c cymatic right and

1842.58 --> 1848.34
what does it mean to be anti-semitic I

1845.19 --> 1853.29
wouldn't know I'm not but from what I

1848.34 --> 1856.53
gather the Jews or the Warlocks among

1853.29 --> 1860.49
the Jews use it to protect themselves

1856.53 --> 1863.52
and to create a common peer pressure

1860.49 --> 1867.39
based fear not to receive criticism for

1863.52 --> 1870.57
that group and what it really means is

1867.39 --> 1872.43
you're just basically anti a certain

1870.57 --> 1874.6499999999999
type of people in a certain type of

1872.43 --> 1877.5800000000002
region which are pretty much common the

1874.65 --> 1882.0
Arabs so that's what it means to be

1877.58 --> 1885.3
anti-semitic and I'm not you know I have

1882.0 --> 1887.01
nothing against it there are some

1885.3 --> 1890.28
problems with the cultures in those

1887.01 --> 1893.27
regions definitely but the race itself I

1890.28 --> 1893.27
have no problem with it

1899.63 --> 1909.89
right so I I got somebody here that

1903.84 --> 1914.79
joined got Reese on the panel know Reese

1909.89 --> 1917.0
welcome I don't know everybody doing

1914.79 --> 1917.0
great

1919.54 --> 1928.06
so I wanted to share a few things I

1923.32 --> 1930.78
think you might enjoy okay we'll start

1928.06 --> 1930.78
with the bed first

1933.06 --> 1942.28
you've mentioned like frequencies been

1937.21 --> 1944.8
going to sleep mm-hmm the extra

1942.28 --> 1950.53
low-frequency stuff that I mentioned to

1944.8 --> 1955.75
you is basically like blow hurts you

1950.53 --> 1957.55
know low Hertz waves but it seems like

1955.75 --> 1963.97
the technology has been perfected

1957.55 --> 1967.0
because back in say 2007 I used to go to

1963.97 --> 1974.44
sleep and if I was really tired when

1967.0 --> 1980.14
going to sleep I would be like it was it

1974.44 --> 1982.27
feel like a reverberating hum I was like

1980.14 --> 1985.3000000000002
the moment where as I go I feel I feel

1982.27 --> 1988.24
tired but like you couldn't really be

1985.3 --> 1989.5
alert enough to play a sports game or

1988.24 --> 1992.41
something you know I mean like your eyes

1989.5 --> 1995.68
are tied your body's tied your mind as

1992.41 --> 1999.8500000000001
being you know tired and it was those

1995.68 --> 2001.65
days where just the whole body was just

1999.85 --> 2005.31
needing to sleep from one go and it was

2001.65 --> 2008.22
like that moment just before like waking

2005.31 --> 2012.35
and going down consciousness it was like

2008.22 --> 2016.26
a you know like

2012.35 --> 2018.51
kind of you know was in it it was quite

2016.26 --> 2020.67
unnerving you know it was it was an

2018.51 --> 2023.33
interim and then like waking up and then

2020.67 --> 2025.68
like trying to splash water on her face

2023.33 --> 2028.6499999999999
couldn't hear it anymore you know I mean

2025.68 --> 2032.73
and then it's like it went away and then

2028.65 --> 2034.44
but it was always like like early early

2032.73 --> 2035.76
in the morning you know I mean like if

2034.44 --> 2039.06
you think about it like if it was a

2035.76 --> 2041.48
machine they turn on then they would

2039.06 --> 2041.48
turn it on

2042.38 --> 2046.71
you know when the majority of people

2044.52 --> 2049.669
should be asleep and unconscious you

2046.71 --> 2054.33
know me and because base travels low

2049.669 --> 2057.929
it's like a it would be able to go

2054.33 --> 2059.7
across you know through houses and you

2057.929 --> 2062.07
know if you're hit with bass music at

2059.7 --> 2065.399
nighttime that is the whole thing about

2062.07 --> 2069.0
it the somatic pattern the the

2065.399 --> 2072.87
resonating it's not stopped like sound

2069.0 --> 2076.909
is stopped by a wall or even glass or

2072.87 --> 2079.89
suppress no it resonates through it

2076.909 --> 2083.79
because it's differently directly it

2079.89 --> 2087.72
finds a casing like a guitar the guitar

2083.79 --> 2090.84
case thing and then it starts to

2087.72 --> 2092.1299999999997
resonate with that case and that's kind

2090.84 --> 2093.55
of how it works and it goes through

2092.13 --> 2097.48
everything

2093.55 --> 2099.79
and it moves around things even it's

2097.48 --> 2104.25
very weird how it works it's a different

2099.79 --> 2106.81
type of sound but it's that exactly

2104.25 --> 2110.65
that's why when somebody's having a

2106.81 --> 2112.96
party you know down in the street and

2110.65 --> 2114.94
they've got like a loud loud bass line

2112.96 --> 2117.4900000000002
to the music but there's no more ambient

2114.94 --> 2118.9
noise of nature and you know everybody's

2117.49 --> 2121.0299999999997
asleep and there's no cars driving

2118.9 --> 2124.0
around and things like that you can hear

2121.03 --> 2127.03
those the bass of lines coming so it's

2124.0 --> 2129.16
actually the bass line that's waking you

2127.03 --> 2130.2400000000002
up or you're hearing from the party

2129.16 --> 2132.19
first because it

2130.24 --> 2135.3399999999997
it's just traveling straight through

2132.19 --> 2139.05
everything so the idea that they could

2135.34 --> 2144.3700000000003
perfect this technology over the last

2139.05 --> 2145.8100000000004
112 years is it's not not too hard

2144.37 --> 2147.64
between the fact that well bodies work

2145.81 --> 2151.42
on a resonant you know Anna Kim our

2147.64 --> 2154.5099999999998
residents can be detected you know well

2151.42 --> 2157.2000000000003
there's so many things that I can even

2154.51 --> 2161.2900000000004
think of how it could be maliciously

2157.2 --> 2164.4399999999996
applied they could use it to go into the

2161.29 --> 2167.11
anti frequency the shine the Schoenberg

2164.44 --> 2171.16
concept basically finding the counter

2167.11 --> 2174.25
residence to to disrupt the essence of

2171.16 --> 2177.52
something actually they can try that

2174.25 --> 2180.91
it's got to be very damaging or I don't

2177.52 --> 2185.56
know it's just malicious yeah but also

2180.91 --> 2187.42
you should also get in the way that's

2185.56 --> 2189.79
what I feel that's habitable to me that

2187.42 --> 2192.19
you know doing it or they aren't it's

2189.79 --> 2196.27
happening and it's just getting in my

2192.19 --> 2200.44
way preventing me from fully arresting

2196.27 --> 2203.11
for example or from getting deeper into

2200.44 --> 2205.27
the dream world cause it like even if I

2203.11 --> 2207.01
go asleep even though my consciousness

2205.27 --> 2209.59
doesn't pick it up in a physical world

2207.01 --> 2213.8500000000004
anymore it's still physically there and

2209.59 --> 2216.069
still on my being which is my interface

2213.85 --> 2218.049
with the dream world is like the

2216.069 --> 2220.749
gate that the spirit goes through to the

2218.049 --> 2223.989
other side and it's still gonna have an

2220.749 --> 2227.1989999999996
effect it might have a like a limiter

2223.989 --> 2231.539
effect or even a cage like you cancel

2227.199 --> 2234.089
the interface that's what I even think

2231.539 --> 2237.989
have you heard of the human residence

2234.089 --> 2240.7889999999998
know what soon they get a big issue

2237.989 --> 2244.63
human residence it's like the resident

2240.789 --> 2247.2690000000002
Schumann resonance human race shoe but

2244.63 --> 2250.299
yes that's exactly what I was trying to

2247.269 --> 2253.4489999999996
reference yes so it's like the frequency

2250.299 --> 2256.749
of average of all things exactly and

2253.449 --> 2259.359
everything is a frequency exactly and if

2256.749 --> 2261.549
you think about take away everything

2259.359 --> 2265.42
man-made right take away everything that

2261.549 --> 2267.999
we've created from things in the ground

2265.42 --> 2272.219
iron or stuff like that take that all

2267.999 --> 2275.2889999999998
away you're left with nature right and

2272.219 --> 2277.349
so nature grows off this resonance this

2275.289 --> 2280.119
natural resonance it's creating this

2277.349 --> 2283.42
natural harmonic frequency to keep

2280.119 --> 2286.2090000000003
everything growing sustain alive you

2283.42 --> 2287.859
know the frequency of the earth it has a

2286.209 --> 2290.0789999999997
specific frequency it's even

2287.859 --> 2292.5989999999997
scientifically proven it's weird it's

2290.079 --> 2294.789
been around very well and it's like I

2292.599 --> 2302.699
think it used to be like at 12 that's

2294.789 --> 2302.699
right so this extra low frequency is is

2303.7 --> 2307.75
is is like three Hertz three to six

2307.21 --> 2309.4
Hertz

2307.75 --> 2312.13
you know so it's like having the

2309.4 --> 2314.9700000000003
naturals at like cutting inside the

2312.13 --> 2320.02
natural human the human resonance and

2314.97 --> 2324.339
then you know it's like there was this

2320.02 --> 2326.109
there was this YouTube video as I had

2324.339 --> 2327.82
the strangest name you know you'll even

2326.109 --> 2330.2799999999997
be able to find it from from the

2327.82 --> 2332.44
reference of the title but it was like

2330.28 --> 2334.57
measuring pulse from the heart and the

2332.44 --> 2338.19
polls from the head and it was like

2334.57 --> 2341.619
somebody sending out a hateful thought

2338.19 --> 2345.64
you know bypassed the heart and I came

2341.619 --> 2348.46
out like super fast like something like

2345.64 --> 2350.1299999999997
sixty six billion miles per second or

2348.46 --> 2353.77
something like that

2350.13 --> 2355.7200000000003
well hold on say again I got distracted

2353.77 --> 2359.109
for a moment yeah

2355.72 --> 2361.54
so like they they put the machine on the

2359.109 --> 2365.02
head and it was like a [ __ ] measuring

2361.54 --> 2366.91
the waves and it was like this person

2365.02 --> 2368.74
who had like an evil thought you know

2366.91 --> 2370.81
you know when someone that says

2368.74 --> 2372.64
something to you but it's so nasty that

2370.81 --> 2376.089
it comes like at it like you like an

2372.64 --> 2379.15
arrow you know this was like being the

2376.089 --> 2381.339
idea here but then the office it was

2379.15 --> 2383.44
somebody who had a like a feeling of

2381.339 --> 2386.77
love you know and it came out like a

2383.44 --> 2391.06
bubble at half the speed so I was like

2386.77 --> 2393.67
the hot bubble the Hat full heartfelt

2391.06 --> 2395.8289999999997
thoughtful came out half the speed in

2393.67 --> 2397.51
like I'm and I was depicted as I kept

2395.829 --> 2400.569
cutting through

2397.51 --> 2402.88
but just moving fast but just like

2400.569 --> 2407.41
calmly fast so when it hit the other

2402.88 --> 2409.809
person it was it was just

2407.41 --> 2412.92
it was it was like not destroying them

2409.809 --> 2416.0190000000002
but the right it's it's not speeding and

2412.92 --> 2418.119
disruptive like a quick distortion

2416.019 --> 2425.019
creating but like something that just

2418.119 --> 2428.8900000000003
slowly approaches you and like a slower

2425.019 --> 2431.47
March but more determined like that

2428.89 --> 2434.259
exactly like a like a like a moving

2431.47 --> 2435.91
bubble that hits the person improve but

2434.259 --> 2437.7400000000002
the double the speed was like an arrow

2435.91 --> 2440.14
that went straight through the person

2437.74 --> 2441.97
you know I mean you know like ripples

2440.14 --> 2443.769
them so like someone who's in an

2441.97 --> 2445.74
argument and they're getting me out it

2443.769 --> 2449.859
by someone who despises them you know

2445.74 --> 2451.72
you know it's coming not only voice but

2449.859 --> 2456.7
it's the thought forms that are that are

2451.72 --> 2458.89
forming the words that yes yes exactly

2456.7 --> 2462.569
the intention that's proven to resonate

2458.89 --> 2467.069
with water of which we all consist 95%

2462.569 --> 2470.47
so yeah that happens it's it's it's an a

2467.069 --> 2475.24
a part of communication that is heavily

2470.47 --> 2476.9199999999996
overlooked by most humans it's a part of

2475.24 --> 2483.3399999999997
its dupré

2476.92 --> 2485.9500000000003
the free part exactly so those are the

2483.34 --> 2489.79
so I went from bad we've gone to like a

2485.95 --> 2492.46
middle ground you know so now I'll give

2489.79 --> 2495.93
you the I'll give you the good pot that

2492.46 --> 2499.3
I wanted to tell you okay have you ever

2495.93 --> 2502.0299999999997
and everybody in chat as well you can

2499.3 --> 2506.23
ask yourself this question but have you

2502.03 --> 2509.6800000000003
ever heard the pie song the not the not

2506.23 --> 2511.9900000000002
the pie that you eat but three point you

2509.68 --> 2518.3199999999997
know oh dear one four five six have you

2511.99 --> 2521.22
ever heard the pie song maybe maybe in a

2518.32 --> 2526.54
while ago I don't know how old is that

2521.22 --> 2528.97
yeah but see when it first came out it

2526.54 --> 2531.91
was actually copy written struck you

2528.97 --> 2534.4599999999996
know we we owned this the first he said

2531.91 --> 2536.5
no no no we we owned this because we

2534.46 --> 2541.87
made it we wrote it and they went to

2536.5 --> 2545.34
court and they won and now the songs

2541.87 --> 2548.7999999999997
back up on youtube so we just searching

2545.34 --> 2551.79
the paesan what it is is they I think

2548.8 --> 2556.3
they took the first eight decimals of pi

2551.79 --> 2559.75
right and then they put it into a song

2556.3 --> 2564.0
playing those numbers in the octave key

2559.75 --> 2568.57
that it represented all right right

2564.0 --> 2572.5
missing absolutely algorithmic music

2568.57 --> 2575.23
yeah nice absolutely amazing you know

2572.5 --> 2577.0
for me too you know because they can do

2575.23 --> 2578.89
it with any different instrument you

2577.0 --> 2581.89
know like they can start with like um

2578.89 --> 2583.54
like a keyboard or something and play

2581.89 --> 2585.79
the pivot play the next chord on a

2583.54 --> 2587.86
guitar and then play something on even

2585.79 --> 2589.33
on an exile phone you know so high level

2587.86 --> 2593.76
low level it just doesn't matter

2589.33 --> 2596.13
and it's just total harmonic sound

2593.76 --> 2597.84
whining you know

2596.13 --> 2601.38
and I found it interesting that

2597.84 --> 2603.33
something so beautiful and so so

2601.38 --> 2605.73
intuitive you know that they you know

2603.33 --> 2608.64
that they've worked it out but that it

2605.73 --> 2610.47
was instantly attacked you know and some

2608.64 --> 2615.2999999999997
music company claimed copyright on it

2610.47 --> 2616.83
just to get rid of it you know so if it

2615.3 --> 2619.3500000000004
was quite interesting but now it's

2616.83 --> 2622.89
available you'll know you have the right

2619.35 --> 2624.42
one because it's got the numbers it

2622.89 --> 2626.2799999999997
gives you an instrument introduction in

2624.42 --> 2629.88
the beginning and then while the song's

2626.28 --> 2631.8
playing it splits into like the four

2629.88 --> 2633.54
cells on the screen so you got like the

2631.8 --> 2635.82
different instruments in each one and

2633.54 --> 2638.49
then you know just you can see each

2635.82 --> 2640.26
person playing the song and it's just

2638.49 --> 2642.0299999999997
just like I used to listen to it

2640.26 --> 2644.5800000000004
constantly you know just all the time

2642.03 --> 2648.63
when I was feeling down because it was

2644.58 --> 2651.2999999999997
like that's a de mathematics derivative

2648.63 --> 2653.73
derived information that creates

2651.3 --> 2656.04
harmonic resonance sound you know it was

2653.73 --> 2658.62
any instrument in any octave it's just

2656.04 --> 2662.7799999999997
it's fascinating yeah anybody out there

2658.62 --> 2667.5899999999997
hasn't heard it searched the PI song and

2662.78 --> 2669.8100000000004
be amazed if you have a link to it then

2667.59 --> 2672.6000000000004
I can post it in chat or you can post it

2669.81 --> 2675.35
and check you but a wrench okay but yeah

2672.6 --> 2678.69
I'm not gonna play it because ya know

2675.35 --> 2681.0299999999997
remember the song like yesterday I told

2678.69 --> 2685.2000000000003
many people that has happened but yeah I

2681.03 --> 2688.3100000000004
played like the hoverboard thing video

2685.2 --> 2691.9199999999996
for one and a half minute and I got a

2688.31 --> 2694.2599999999998
yeah I got demonetized for that video

2691.92 --> 2696.9300000000003
for playing that song immediately it's

2694.26 --> 2701.65
like every time the music

2696.93 --> 2703.359
so I had to like also edit it to get the

2701.65 --> 2705.069
song out even though it's kind of shame

2703.359 --> 2709.7799999999997
because I really did like the song I

2705.069 --> 2712.99
loved it was very appropriate but yeah

2709.78 --> 2715.5690000000004
I'm the since this is specifically music

2712.99 --> 2717.1299999999997
related I'm not gonna play if I'm not

2715.569 --> 2718.75
gonna risk playing it because that's

2717.13 --> 2720.369
gonna be the same thing over again and

2718.75 --> 2723.4
if I then remove it then it makes note

2720.369 --> 2727.54
then there's no point to it so I'd

2723.4 --> 2729.609
rather just yeah give out the link to

2727.54 --> 2733.0589999999997
people in chat so they can check it out

2729.609 --> 2737.859
themselves and yeah I want to hear it

2733.059 --> 2741.13
myself as well okay I'll do my best to

2737.859 --> 2744.0099999999998
find it well alright no hurry oh I think

2741.13 --> 2748.4100000000003
I got it really seven years ago a song

2744.01 --> 2748.4100000000003
from PI this might be it

2750.299 --> 2757.63
now see everybody's just hijacking the

2753.19 --> 2762.69
idea but that's not the original hmm

2757.63 --> 2767.109
yeah damn II can just posted something

2762.69 --> 2768.4
is that it let me check it out in

2767.109 --> 2771.409
silence

2768.4 --> 2771.409
[Music]

2775.24 --> 2780.3399999999997
[Music]

2777.0 --> 2782.85
all right the pie song is it that's it

2780.34 --> 2785.53
yeah Adam thanks for the link

2782.85 --> 2789.54
it's fascinating oaf is that what the

2785.53 --> 2793.84
song how two million views yeah

2789.54 --> 2798.07
now the correct one is called what pie

2793.84 --> 2800.65
sounds like by a mic just a second okay

2798.07 --> 2803.65
well she Shane this is the one I'm

2800.65 --> 2806.1
referring to one amendment put it in

2803.65 --> 2806.1
check now

2817.89 --> 2824.71
yeah that's that enjoy and you can put

2821.799 --> 2828.39
your buddy offline one now

2824.71 --> 2831.19
sorry a bit Ali wouldn't you love me

2828.39 --> 2835.3489999999997
okay Adam posted another link I don't

2831.19 --> 2835.349
know I'll use yours

2837.769 --> 2841.4599999999996
what pie sounds like I had this much

2840.779 --> 2850.319
longer

2841.46 --> 2853.2
yeah cool yeah it's you being you know

2850.319 --> 2855.69
like I thought it was gonna be just like

2853.2 --> 2858.1189999999997
random you know I had no idea that it

2855.69 --> 2861.299
would just be out of cycle into itself

2858.119 --> 2863.13
continuously you know I Monica you could

2861.299 --> 2867.38
play it in every octave at the same time

2863.13 --> 2870.359
and we just we're just hum together

2867.38 --> 2873.1800000000003
can't close it I'm very curious to check

2870.359 --> 2875.0389999999998
it out but yeah it's no use doing that

2873.18 --> 2882.839
during the show or I'd have to put on

2875.039 --> 2884.0690000000004
headphones just listen to it but yeah

2882.839 --> 2889.17
thanks for the tip that's very

2884.069 --> 2892.829
interesting yeah look music sound its it

2889.17 --> 2895.289
can be used for healing as well so in

2892.829 --> 2899.279
that sense I'm not I mean I'm not

2895.289 --> 2899.6090000000004
totally anti somatic you know not all of

2899.279 --> 2902.48
it

2899.609 --> 2902.48
it just

2902.59 --> 2910.3700000000003
just the disruptive music and it's not

2907.97 --> 2913.9399999999996
just you know when I go to sleep this

2910.37 --> 2918.17
residency my spine no it's also really

2913.94 --> 2920.78
shitty music out there like that's being

2918.17 --> 2923.48
forwarded on mainstream music channels

2920.78 --> 2926.63
and like really crappy disruptive

2923.48 --> 2929.36
invasive music that's like being

2926.63 --> 2932.12
attention grabby and noisy like

2929.36 --> 2945.8
disruptive just to get your attention I

2932.12 --> 2950.9
hate soap soap edgy oh no sorry so Fred

2945.8 --> 2954.05
it's like it's like what they say now is

2950.9 --> 2958.4
that our instruments are all tuned just

2954.05 --> 2960.5
outside of the Solfeggio frequencies all

2958.4 --> 2962.51
right right yeah yeah yeah yeah I know

2960.5 --> 2966.47
there's something about frequencies this

2962.51 --> 2974.36
is like my mother knows knew everything

2966.47 --> 2977.12
about that I was like what they found is

2974.36 --> 2979.31
that if too many instruments we were

2977.12 --> 2982.2799999999997
tuned to this one frequency and I had

2979.31 --> 2985.58
like a whole walkush go they could

2982.28 --> 2988.55
actually like make the whole building

2985.58 --> 2990.7999999999997
kind of walk and move with with him and

2988.55 --> 2992.6000000000004
that was the claim it's like we have to

2990.8 --> 2995.57
stop playing it could destroy the

2992.6 --> 2997.64
building you know as if it was matching

2995.57 --> 3000.1000000000004
this minute so doing it outside with

2997.64 --> 3003.16
actually harmonics would actually

3000.1 --> 3006.25
harmonics would actually cymatics that's

3003.16 --> 3009.3999999999996
that's exactly where cymatics is derived

3006.25 --> 3012.19
from it's basically using that effect

3009.4 --> 3015.169
that's really pretty much figured out

3012.19 --> 3019.109
through music and then

3015.169 --> 3023.429
yeah engineering it and kind of

3019.109 --> 3026.669
weaponizing it to cause effects and

3023.429 --> 3029.069
that's where cymatics was born exactly

3026.669 --> 3031.0989999999997
and that's what I mean by all the

3029.069 --> 3033.929
positives based on the nature you know

3031.099 --> 3036.929
derived from nature and all these things

3033.929 --> 3039.299
that they sound healing chambers you

3036.929 --> 3043.079
know once they were in the pyramid Co

3039.299 --> 3045.479
2001 it was yeah about the hydroelectric

3043.079 --> 3047.9990000000003
nature of pyramids which is mind-blowing

3045.479 --> 3052.109
it was absolutely a game changer to me

3047.999 --> 3054.479
it helped me to figure out the Atlantean

3052.109 --> 3056.7889999999998
age and Giants and how that all work

3054.479 --> 3059.999
together but yeah in that same

3056.789 --> 3065.9990000000003
documentary there is also very extensive

3059.999 --> 3068.839
elaborate yeah researching of sound

3065.999 --> 3073.6189999999997
healing chambers chambers made of stones

3068.839 --> 3075.9
put in a very specific architecture that

3073.619 --> 3078.4790000000003
when you like to speak up in there it

3075.9 --> 3081.289
echoes in a very specific way and almost

3078.479 --> 3084.269
like starts humming afterwards and

3081.289 --> 3088.1090000000004
exactly there those are used for

3084.269 --> 3090.8089999999997
specific healing rituals where somebody

3088.109 --> 3092.7889999999998
with a sort of illness would would go in

3090.809 --> 3095.989
or like heavily burdened or even wounded

3092.789 --> 3099.719
could walk in there a priest

3095.989 --> 3103.109
understanding sound perfectly would then

3099.719 --> 3106.89
sing in that chamber and like it would

3103.109 --> 3111.209
echo and cause all these amazing effects

3106.89 --> 3114.9
that were known to heal like miraculous

3111.209 --> 3120.0499999999997
healing type is nothing

3114.9 --> 3124.13
I think one of them is some Luxor

3120.05 --> 3127.2000000000003
Luxor Temple of Osiris there is a

3124.13 --> 3129.12
there's an area there with the rocks ooh

3127.2 --> 3131.3999999999996
and it was almost like they walk down

3129.12 --> 3134.19
the stairs into the healing into the

3131.4 --> 3137.57
harmonic chamber where they would tap

3134.19 --> 3142.02
things on the side and it would create I

3137.57 --> 3143.9100000000003
think a out a field of sound that would

3142.02 --> 3146.7
go across the person and they would

3143.91 --> 3149.8199999999997
somehow thank you safe and yield and

3146.7 --> 3152.64
hand still relaxed or put into a certain

3149.82 --> 3155.4300000000003
state or whatever but then if you think

3152.64 --> 3158.0099999999998
about like some of the pictures that are

3155.43 --> 3161.0699999999997
depicted of the Pharaohs I believe brows

3158.01 --> 3164.8700000000003
one of them you can see the bottom of

3161.07 --> 3167.3700000000003
his stick is a tuning fork you know so

3164.87 --> 3169.0499999999997
it's the bottom of the staff of the

3167.37 --> 3171.7799999999997
tuning fork and then other people

3169.05 --> 3174.53
holding Kings walks you know all these

3171.78 --> 3179.61
things that you know we might overlook

3174.53 --> 3183.42
but remember that in the Baalbek temple

3179.61 --> 3185.82
there's the obelisk of it that's 120 6

3183.42 --> 3188.9
foot long and finished but when they

3185.82 --> 3191.4
tapped on the stone to bring like a bell

3188.9 --> 3194.4300000000003
you know it's the idea that this huge

3191.4 --> 3197.6600000000003
big resonance tuning fork could be used

3194.43 --> 3202.19
in some type of mess

3197.66 --> 3204.56
mess frequency generation or something

3202.19 --> 3206.84
of that nature it's not completely

3204.56 --> 3210.14
overlooked but the idea that if there

3206.84 --> 3212.98
was any benefit for mankind in human

3210.14 --> 3215.39
bodies and health that they would first

3212.98 --> 3218.15
maximize the benefits for themself and

3215.39 --> 3221.12
then turn it on the public like you say

3218.15 --> 3222.65
weaponize it right because why would why

3221.12 --> 3226.9
would they want a whole bunch of free

3222.65 --> 3230.9
thinking healthy you know non-affiliated

3226.9 --> 3234.29
people of God right with all this power

3230.9 --> 3239.39
and knowledge available to be in

3234.29 --> 3242.66
basically like free free logos wizards

3239.39 --> 3244.8199999999997
we could all be free logos based wizards

3242.66 --> 3247.96
godly wizards that just use the

3244.82 --> 3251.9300000000003
knowledge for good and glory and health

3247.96 --> 3253.91
but no no no the Phoenicians no they

3251.93 --> 3257.1499999999996
don't like it the Phoenicians the

3253.91 --> 3259.79
warlocks the method it's it's one thing

3257.15 --> 3261.86
it's all one thing they're warlocks they

3259.79 --> 3265.58
were Phoenicians and they follow that

3261.86 --> 3269.1200000000003
methodology of secrecy disruption divide

3265.58 --> 3272.27
and conquer transform to extract power

3269.12 --> 3275.2999999999997
and money that's what they are and do

3272.27 --> 3276.83
and they do it with everything they get

3275.3 --> 3279.3500000000004
their hands on and everything that comes

3276.83 --> 3281.24
into existence they will bend over it

3279.35 --> 3284.0899999999997
and try to weaponize it and then

3281.24 --> 3286.91
integrate that weaponization in society

3284.09 --> 3289.7000000000003
in some way to get a long term control

3286.91 --> 3292.98
over everything and they've been doing

3289.7 --> 3298.109
that from the beginning

3292.98 --> 3299.52
exactly you know like I know you

3298.109 --> 3301.68
probably heard it but you know there was

3299.52 --> 3307.41
microwave technology for 10 years before

3301.68 --> 3309.06
they gave us the appliance and now you

3307.41 --> 3312.0299999999997
know it's often once they've perfected

3309.06 --> 3317.5499999999997
the technology then they release it you

3312.03 --> 3321.42
know so we're always boys keep it behind

3317.55 --> 3323.52
to keep us right we're always dealing

3321.42 --> 3326.28
with the aftermath after it has already

3323.52 --> 3328.589
been applied it's like okay yeah look

3326.28 --> 3330.0600000000004
who we got now now learn to deal with it

3328.589 --> 3332.46
what are you gonna do are you gonna

3330.06 --> 3335.5499999999997
adapt are you going to bring down the

3332.46 --> 3338.46
technology or are you gonna somehow

3335.55 --> 3340.1090000000004
surpass it I'm so curious what our lab

3338.46 --> 3343.8
rats are going to do with our

3340.109 --> 3347.25
experiments that we set up that's what

3343.8 --> 3351.4100000000003
they do they they don't treat us like

3347.25 --> 3351.41
cattle they treat us like a lab rats

3353.58 --> 3358.56
[Music]

3355.28 --> 3361.2200000000003
calculating algorithms for reactions and

3358.56 --> 3361.22
things of this nature

3361.75 --> 3372.13
it's it's sadistic to the court because

3369.07 --> 3373.9
it's pre-empting society to act in a

3372.13 --> 3375.6400000000003
certain way we do this if we do this

3373.9 --> 3378.01
enough and everybody will think this and

3375.64 --> 3379.6299999999997
if we do this to these people then those

3378.01 --> 3382.09
people will hate those people

3379.63 --> 3384.01
and if those people get a story out to

3382.09 --> 3385.7200000000003
these people then all those people will

3384.01 --> 3388.84
agree with these people you know it's

3385.72 --> 3391.2099999999996
just this horrible problem and so rather

3388.84 --> 3395.1400000000003
than people looking into things for

3391.21 --> 3399.46
themselves they take the other person's

3395.14 --> 3402.8199999999997
word for it you know I don't know we

3399.46 --> 3404.08
just all need to think for ourselves we

3402.82 --> 3407.26
all need to evaluate things with

3404.08 --> 3410.68
ourselves and look into these things for

3407.26 --> 3412.03
ourselves and then if you're on research

3410.68 --> 3414.5499999999997
that determines that there's nothing

3412.03 --> 3417.88
there then at least you ain't gave it a

3414.55 --> 3421.57
look right what I recommend to everyone

3417.88 --> 3424.06
is what I have been doing every time you

3421.57 --> 3428.849
get confronted with something new that

3424.06 --> 3432.2799999999997
you feel there's something to this don't

3428.849 --> 3435.04
automatically neurotically try to

3432.28 --> 3436.69
attempt to get it all immediately

3435.04 --> 3439.39
because you're going to oversimplify

3436.69 --> 3443.53
you're gonna over generalize they're

3439.39 --> 3445.15
gonna draw a subpar conclusion this is

3443.53 --> 3447.6090000000004
what happens when you get introduced

3445.15 --> 3452.89
with heavy new stuff what you actually

3447.609 --> 3455.3489999999997
need to do let's let it sink and think

3452.89 --> 3457.39
about it for a while reflect that

3455.349 --> 3458.65
knowledge you gained on that moment on

3457.39 --> 3460.42
other things

3458.65 --> 3462.1600000000003
that happened before that and that are

3460.42 --> 3464.71
happening after it see how others

3462.16 --> 3467.41
respond and then you get a much more

3464.71 --> 3470.25
refined perspective on what it actually

3467.41 --> 3474.31
is and what it's not because you if you

3470.25 --> 3476.98
neurotically determine the conclusion

3474.31 --> 3479.68
immediately is great likelihood you'll

3476.98 --> 3481.42
be totally sidestepping the point and

3479.68 --> 3486.5099999999998
not actually getting what it's actually

3481.42 --> 3486.51
about because that takes time to sink in

3487.7 --> 3493.29
exactly true knowledge requires

3490.19 --> 3498.9900000000002
contemplation true knowledge only really

3493.29 --> 3501.0299999999997
works when wisdom becomes involved yeah

3498.99 --> 3504.06
when I have to wonder what Jose's doing

3501.03 --> 3505.6800000000003
here right now trolling you know yeah I

3504.06 --> 3509.16
mean what are you doing here hosting

3505.68 --> 3510.54
you're not helping anybody he's being

3509.16 --> 3512.3999999999996
populist by the Warlocks

3510.54 --> 3516.65
you just and he doesn't even know

3512.4 --> 3519.77
anything have you no respect for Allen

3516.65 --> 3522.03
nah don't worry about it Jose is Jose

3519.77 --> 3523.89
don't you worry about when this is

3522.03 --> 3526.71
coming from me I came the question have

3523.89 --> 3531.5099999999998
you no respect but Alwyn because I

3526.71 --> 3536.46
respect Allen you can answer me in check

3531.51 --> 3539.88
hmm once your untimed out I'm sick of it

3536.46 --> 3542.19
I saw the things before I came on here

3539.88 --> 3544.65
it's unacceptable these are friends of

3542.19 --> 3549.27
Arlen not enemies

3544.65 --> 3555.1800000000003
not really Jose is a troll he's a very

3549.27 --> 3558.84
good troll he knows how to troll in a

3555.18 --> 3562.23
very amusing way very alluring but he is

3558.84 --> 3564.81
a troll and he will have his jaw

3562.23 --> 3567.869
response moments that seem very out of

3564.81 --> 3570.63
place but that's actually who he is he

3567.869 --> 3574.1400000000003
just behaves himself as with an

3570.63 --> 3576.54
attention seeker right because he uses

3574.14 --> 3578.94
words like verbal diarrhea but what do

3576.54 --> 3580.59
you come on and say Owen that what do

3578.94 --> 3582.19
you come on and say that oh and Jose

3580.59 --> 3584.9500000000003
[Music]

3582.19 --> 3588.13
you know Kimmel once well my tradition

3584.95 --> 3589.6299999999997
is curvature and that you know so the

3588.13 --> 3591.76
ball doesn't make any sense but he's

3589.63 --> 3594.1800000000003
gonna believe it anyway and that he's

3591.76 --> 3598.3590000000004
okay with that he's okay with believing

3594.18 --> 3601.0299999999997
so yeah it's much easier to trust your

3598.359 --> 3605.92
controllers isn't it rather than stand

3601.03 --> 3608.079
against them right yeah controllers love

3605.92 --> 3611.9500000000003
it when you trust them because then they

3608.079 --> 3615.52
can actually use that trust and that

3611.95 --> 3618.0989999999997
lack of insight to stare you like a

3615.52 --> 3619.809
puppet and you'll never know it because

3618.099 --> 3621.819
you don't have oversight over what's

3619.809 --> 3624.88
happening in the big picture only what's

3621.819 --> 3628.0299999999997
happening right there in front of you so

3624.88 --> 3632.589
you don't know what how you are a pawn

3628.03 --> 3634.599
in bit in the bigger scheme of things if

3632.589 --> 3638.38
you do have oversight then you do know

3634.599 --> 3642.039
and feel that yeah that's not the that's

3638.38 --> 3645.789
not something you should do because you

3642.039 --> 3651.2200000000003
have oversight if you don't have an

3645.789 --> 3653.92
oversight because you you trust the

3651.22 --> 3658.049
controllers then you're not going to see

3653.92 --> 3658.049
what your actions are a part of

3658.829 --> 3666.849
yeah well I don't appreciate it as a

3663.549 --> 3673.589
friend of my oh and I'll tell you to

3666.849 --> 3677.44
your face right now but yeah look he is

3673.589 --> 3680.5
religion religion allergic he has a

3677.44 --> 3683.4
little allergies to religion except for

3680.5 --> 3685.779
the ball and that's like really

3683.4 --> 3687.549
two-faced of him because he kind of

3685.779 --> 3689.38
almost admits that the religion is a

3687.549 --> 3692.109
ball yet he's perfectly fine with that

3689.38 --> 3695.5
but every time somebody starts to talk

3692.109 --> 3698.91
about Jesus Christ or during yeah

3695.5 --> 3701.95
ethereal stuff like Sirius the path

3698.91 --> 3705.569
subjects like we treat he gets into a

3701.95 --> 3708.8489999999997
fit he gets like I want to shut him up

3705.569 --> 3712.24
it's neurotic and his demons are

3708.849 --> 3713.7400000000002
irritated right they don't want him to

3712.24 --> 3716.5
bring bring him to the light or let the

3713.74 --> 3722.529
light shine on him because then it makes

3716.5 --> 3725.5
him look at himself right answer then

3722.529 --> 3728.41
reformed himself with with other people

3725.5 --> 3732.43
and the decision he makes with those and

3728.41 --> 3735.0099999999998
how he lets probably dark influences in

3732.43 --> 3738.3999999999996
others that are close to him get the

3735.01 --> 3740.4100000000003
better of him and to keep things stable

3738.4 --> 3744.01
he overlooks it that's how it usually

3740.41 --> 3745.5989999999997
works the control is not from within

3744.01 --> 3748.42
it's usually the people you've

3745.599 --> 3752.8900000000003
surrounded yourself with and are leaning

3748.42 --> 3755.589
on and then not working lose all that

3752.89 --> 3758.65
and that is what drives you into the

3755.589 --> 3763.0299999999997
hands of that of the darkness he's a

3758.65 --> 3765.46
growing man he should not act like this

3763.03 --> 3767.5600000000004
and by the way Jose you better get it

3765.46 --> 3768.94
out the way now because you know

3767.56 --> 3772.12
everyone's gonna read this sends a

3768.94 --> 3776.8
judgement so you know your verdict will

3772.12 --> 3782.89
be just of course so you might as well

3776.8 --> 3784.23
deal with it now it's never too late to

3782.89 --> 3789.0
do the right thing

3784.23 --> 3792.7
exactly so people have faith in chat no

3789.0 --> 3798.28
there's no walking around it there's

3792.7 --> 3800.14
only going through it you can walk

3798.28 --> 3801.48
around it but it's kind of a waste of

3800.14 --> 3804.58
energy

3801.48 --> 3807.07
anyway you come here and label things

3804.58 --> 3809.79
and comment on how are one's doing from

3807.07 --> 3812.26
behind a picture we know who you are but

3809.79 --> 3813.97
come on man if you're so tough

3812.26 --> 3816.7000000000003
you've got the joint join and tell him

3813.97 --> 3818.2599999999998
did you won't do that because you're

3816.7 --> 3818.83
after the nice lepers and you're after

3818.26 --> 3820.9300000000003
the other

3818.83 --> 3823.33
faceless people that might come join the

3820.93 --> 3825.64
chat and take a shot at Alan because he

3823.33 --> 3829.41
puts himself in a vulnerable position to

3825.64 --> 3832.5699999999997
be attacked which is courage and brave

3829.41 --> 3835.5699999999997
instead of behind keyboard words and

3832.57 --> 3838.8700000000003
spelling mistakes with your guesses

3835.57 --> 3842.23
you mean guests wrote it so fast you

3838.87 --> 3844.27
couldn't even write it correctly you

3842.23 --> 3847.69
know anyway Jose

3844.27 --> 3849.99
Food for Thought the creator's your

3847.69 --> 3849.9900000000002
breath

3852.67 --> 3858.59
well I don't yeah it's a good thank you

3856.1 --> 3862.0699999999997
for defending me and yeah you got a very

3858.59 --> 3864.4700000000003
good point it's just that look back

3862.07 --> 3866.3900000000003
within the episode of Jose's betrayal

3864.47 --> 3867.23
that's what I pretty much caught it off

3866.39 --> 3870.98
oh dear

3867.23 --> 3874.34
Thanks I just wanted to round it out the

3870.98 --> 3877.43
show yeah but I heard I being called out

3874.34 --> 3878.9
for reasons I don't understand what the

3877.43 --> 3883.43
reasons are being called out are being

3878.9 --> 3884.63
called something about repent or

3883.43 --> 3886.1299999999997

3893.72 --> 3900.56
you want to explain it again yeah sure

3897.22 --> 3902.7799999999997

3918.56 --> 3924.08
smoke and not been talking not been

been called that and I take it I'm a

3933.14 --> 3940.31
[ __ ] [ __ ] on YouTube right if not

3937.24 --> 3942.4399999999996
you're right it's not that I'm not evil

3940.31 --> 3944.93
warrior you know I show my face I'm Jose

3942.44 --> 3948.35
Gonzalez this is my house right here no

3944.93 --> 3950.39

3948.35 --> 3952.0099999999998
appreciate it I know you're just a guy

3950.39 --> 3955.64
you do things that's very nice but

3952.01 --> 3958.9100000000003
that's not what Ruiz was asking you you

3955.64 --> 3962.5899999999997
were saying specific things about me in

3958.91 --> 3965.81
chat so why don't you say to my face

3962.59 --> 3968.33
why are you worms deleted now you're a

3965.81 --> 3970.2799999999997
verbal diarrhea master for example

3968.33 --> 3972.35
something like that I put in the chat I

3970.28 --> 3973.9700000000003
forget worse I like trolling man this is

3972.35 --> 3975.95
part of the YouTube flattered universe

3973.97 --> 3978.5899999999997
bro we'll learn how to be trolls you are

3975.95 --> 3980.21
verbal diarrhea a master yeah I have

3978.59 --> 3982.58
told you in your face you got skills to

3980.21 --> 3983.63
talk to [ __ ] all us and post

3982.58 --> 3985.97
subjects I do

3983.63 --> 3989.06
skills so you are verbal diarrhea master

3985.97 --> 3991.0099999999998
it's true all right so so you can't see

3989.06 --> 3992.84
the structure of what I'm saying because

3991.01 --> 3993.7400000000002
there's a lot of people out there that

3992.84 --> 3996.2000000000003
are getting it

3993.74 --> 3996.83
you do realize let me say let me say

3996.2 --> 4001.6299999999997
something

3996.83 --> 4004.96
Owen as perhaps Jose the knowledge that

4001.63 --> 4010.63
Alan speaks is blocked to you perhaps

4004.96 --> 4012.43
you're John twelve forty per haps you

4010.63 --> 4015.9700000000003
have a hardened heart and blinded

4012.43 --> 4018.0
spiritual eyes perhaps you're not one

4015.97 --> 4020.77
who has eyes to see and ears to hear

4018.0 --> 4022.96
perhaps you've said too many things

4020.77 --> 4026.02
perhaps your intent is evil

4022.96 --> 4026.44
perhaps like oh this is garbage see you

4026.02 --> 4033.49
later

4026.44 --> 4035.9500000000003
yeah demons yeah that's you went a

4033.49 --> 4039.49
little far but yeah the truth hurts

4035.95 --> 4041.29
Hey look what he even said it himself he

4039.49 --> 4044.7099999999996
doesn't really remember what happened

4041.29 --> 4047.59
so he's sup just doing things outside of

4044.71 --> 4049.83
his own conscious and then when you

4047.59 --> 4054.54
confronted him with it the details of it

4049.83 --> 4058.93
he walked away it's very telling perhaps

4054.54 --> 4063.4
is something to question did I say Jose

4058.93 --> 4065.5299999999997
you are no I said perhaps perhaps and

4063.4 --> 4069.55
just the mere thought of you having to

4065.53 --> 4072.9100000000003
contemplate it was too much for you yeah

4069.55 --> 4077.6200000000003
question yourself I do it I do it a lot

4072.91 --> 4081.52
I on this show regularly from the start

4077.62 --> 4082.39
said I feel weird like am i doing the

4081.52 --> 4085.54
right thing

4082.39 --> 4089.3199999999997
god am i doing things right question

4085.54 --> 4091.9
yourself it's very important to stay on

4089.32 --> 4095.26
the right track and if you walk away

4091.9 --> 4098.79
from questioning yourself on a deeper

4095.26 --> 4104.26
level beyond your comfort zone yeah

4098.79 --> 4108.07
you're bound to go astray from the path

4104.26 --> 4112.030000000001
and start to abandon Lobos exactly in

4108.07 --> 4114.88
the moment the moment reality took he

4112.03 --> 4116.2
named it [ __ ] rather than saying

4114.88 --> 4118.4800000000005
something like okay I'll think about

4116.2 --> 4119.679999999999
that or you you know okay I'll take up

4118.48 --> 4121.78
what you said no no no it's just

4119.68 --> 4124.320000000001
straight dismissal which is lack of

4121.78 --> 4126.969999999999
contemplation which is denial

4124.32 --> 4129.429999999999
I'll take constructive criticism

4126.97 --> 4132.52
I'll take things into account I'll admit

4129.43 --> 4135.76
ignorance but you're not going to take a

4132.52 --> 4137.2300000000005
person with faith like Allen and attack

4135.76 --> 4141.04
him while I'm in the chatter on the

4137.23 --> 4142.99
phone I'm gonna call you out as God is

4141.04 --> 4145.6
my witness I'm gonna call you out right

4142.99 --> 4147.639999999999
and I'm gonna end up timing him out

4145.6 --> 4149.68
because yeah I do find it really

4147.64 --> 4152.56
annoying doesn't hurt me at all but I

4149.68 --> 4156.55
find it disappointing because again I

4152.56 --> 4160.63
have memories in me of Jose being my

4156.55 --> 4163.45
friend and that made me connect to him

4160.63 --> 4165.43
and then that was severed by his

4163.45 --> 4169.54
decisions and now he's acting like this

4165.43 --> 4173.38
and it hurts my memory of how I felt he

4169.54 --> 4177.04
was my friend and that's about it but it

4173.38 --> 4180.34
yeah yeah I'm getting over that so it's

4177.04 --> 4182.47
been a while with his idea it's his idea

4180.34 --> 4185.5
to use YouTube as his platform well this

4182.47 --> 4187.18
is our platform to reply you know what

4185.5 --> 4189.58
I'm sorry but it's weird he just said

4187.18 --> 4194.200000000001
like yeah I'm just learning how to troll

4189.58 --> 4197.32
like what no like that like that's a

4194.2 --> 4200.11
good thing like trolling is a positive

4197.32 --> 4202.179999999999
activity you know okay trolling does get

4200.11 --> 4205.9
things off your heart it is kind of a

4202.18 --> 4208.990000000001
stress relief just like jacking off but

4205.9 --> 4211.66
it doesn't make it a good thing it's

4208.99 --> 4213.76
weird what it is there are the good

4211.66 --> 4216.76
people in chat that come here day in day

4213.76 --> 4219.6990000000005
out you know to see you and talk to you

4216.76 --> 4221.9490000000005
and say hey what's up and care when your

4219.699 --> 4223.8099999999995
up and care when you're down and happy

4221.949 --> 4226.839999999999
when you're up and concerned when you're

4223.81 --> 4228.46
down like real people concerned using

4226.84 --> 4230.9800000000005
the means in which we can communicate

4228.46 --> 4235.54
and then you get this self-proclaimed

4230.98 --> 4237.61
youtube [ __ ] that you know comes on to

4235.54 --> 4238.719
do his thing and I I can't be here every

4237.61 --> 4240.639999999999
day you know but you can be there in

4238.719 --> 4243.61
chat having a smoke while you're at a

4240.64 --> 4246.9890000000005
house you know whatever whatever well

4243.61 --> 4251.799999999999
that's your decision and that was mine

4246.989 --> 4253.87
so you know take it or leave it but if

4251.8 --> 4255.34
you can't see any fault in yourself then

4253.87 --> 4259.12
there's something wrong I could have

4255.34 --> 4262.360000000001
chosen my words bitter perhaps I'll

4259.12 --> 4265.42
consider it but I'm not going to stand

4262.36 --> 4267.69
by and make the faceless I check the

4265.42 --> 4270.52
light no way

4267.69 --> 4274.78
well they don't have thank you thank you

4270.52 --> 4276.910000000001
yeah you're a very noble guy something I

4274.78 --> 4281.17
still sometimes feel like I don't really

4276.91 --> 4283.51
deserve it but I do thank you from the

4281.17 --> 4285.55
bottom of my heart you are a great guy

4283.51 --> 4288.76
and you've been such a friend to me so

4285.55 --> 4293.17
far and I'm just happy that through

4288.76 --> 4295.84
YouTube yeah you met me I met you I'm

4293.17 --> 4298.4800000000005
just thankful that you're there and

4295.84 --> 4301.51
you're my brother in that sense I can't

4298.48 --> 4304.2699999999995
wait I can't wait to introduce you to my

4301.51 --> 4306.52
partner and get it know you as well you

4304.27 --> 4312.070000000001
know when I go to see you bring her home

4306.52 --> 4315.0
finally no really any any date insight

4312.07 --> 4315.0
when that's gonna happen

4315.05 --> 4320.599
while working on now hopefully just

4317.119 --> 4323.03
trying to work out living in stuff like

4320.599 --> 4325.579
that and then the money leftover should

4323.03 --> 4329.54
be none enough for the trip so exciting

4325.579 --> 4331.13
yeah all all moving forward and I'm so

4329.54 --> 4333.23
happy for you and I'm so happy that

4331.13 --> 4337.28
you're gonna be reunited again with your

4333.23 --> 4338.03
love yeah well you know if patience is a

4337.28 --> 4340.909
virtue

4338.03 --> 4348.88
I think we've both we're both alone did

4340.909 --> 4352.67
already mm-hmm yeah yeah Wow

4348.88 --> 4354.909000000001
anyway I know you wanted to run the show

4352.67 --> 4358.67
out yes yes I do

4354.909 --> 4362.058999999999
there's one thing I commend Jose for is

4358.67 --> 4365.03
it's coming on and taking the challenge

4362.059 --> 4369.309
but to actually say it on you know to

4365.03 --> 4372.259999999999
you to your face on the show but yeah

4369.309 --> 4374.4490000000005
yeah you did and then he ran away again

4372.26 --> 4376.46
like that happened last time to when I

4374.449 --> 4378.619
kind of made that comparison there was

4376.46 --> 4380.57
kind of out of place and he even said it

4378.619 --> 4385.61
but he took it personal and then went

4380.57 --> 4389.9
away he but that's what he does in some

4385.61 --> 4392.9
point he victimizes himself and uses

4389.9 --> 4396.339999999999
that as an excuse to run away like oh

4392.9 --> 4402.65
this this is just wrong I'm not gonna

4396.34 --> 4403.34
chose often live under bridges that's

4402.65 --> 4407.808999999999
all right

4403.34 --> 4409.6990000000005
that's right the early Danny Danny come

4407.809 --> 4413.2300000000005
out when they think they can take on the

4409.699 --> 4413.23
person who's trying to cross the bridge

4414.94 --> 4421.549999999999
well that's it's like a form of
