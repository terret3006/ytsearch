you still can and that would be much

74.0 --> 79.66
appreciated so yeah good morning

76.67 --> 84.91
everyone the weather today is quite

79.66 --> 88.94
beautiful actually it's like clear a

84.91 --> 90.979
couple of fluffy clouds there yeah right

88.94 --> 104.17999999999999
before this there was a lot of Sun but

90.979 --> 106.49
then yeah cloud got in front of it so

104.18 --> 110.93
what yeah it's it's bound to be sunny

106.49 --> 116.77
for most of the day time and again this

110.93 --> 116.77000000000001
morning I woke up strong it is just

117.13 --> 121.58999999999999
it's almost a bit unsettling how

121.979 --> 127.24
switches around depending on what type

124.42 --> 129.19
of weather it is with me at the time but

127.24 --> 134.76
anyway hmm

129.19 --> 138.459
I got tea with me mint tea that's it I

134.76 --> 141.16
did have a tumeric coffee about an hour

138.459 --> 143.65
ago I thought okay maybe if I just take

141.16 --> 147.31
one coffee take it slowly see how it

143.65 --> 150.76000000000002
goes because the last Tamera coffee I

147.31 --> 153.85
had I I took like one sip of it

150.76 --> 155.2
yesterday and I had to throw the rest

153.85 --> 158.1
away I just couldn't drink it anymore

155.2 --> 161.17
it's just too much

158.1 --> 168.57
so the caffeine thing that I thought was

161.17 --> 168.57
an issue it seems to be very influential

168.6 --> 174.97
it's like yeah well I say it's feeble I

172.48 --> 179.44
feel kind of feeble it means I'm easily

174.97 --> 183.28
or for me more easily shaken especially

179.44 --> 186.519
by things that I consume and caffeine

183.28 --> 189.16
typically and related substances to that

186.519 --> 192.28
from tea and all that it kind of tends

189.16 --> 194.38
to shake you up a bit and yeah people

192.28 --> 196.48
experience that in general as waking up

194.38 --> 199.51
and also does all kinds of other things

196.48 --> 202.63
with your metabolism but yeah when I

199.51 --> 207.64
feel like this that's shaking up cancer

202.63 --> 210.67
can also spurt restlessness that can

207.64 --> 212.36999999999998
cascade so I have to be very careful

210.67 --> 215.89
with it and it seems to kind of work

212.37 --> 220.239
also toning down on the beer like I've

215.89 --> 222.97
haft my intake which is like smaller

220.239 --> 224.739
amounts that I have ever had when I was

222.97 --> 227.45
drinking and it seems to be fine it's

224.739 --> 232.06900000000002
just take less

227.45 --> 236.32999999999998
I I guess I'm just more sensitive to all

232.069 --> 239.23
of it now right yes

236.33 --> 247.81900000000002
hello Missouri Bear yeah there's just a

239.23 --> 250.1
really fantastic article just so

247.819 --> 253.97
incredibly well researched from Paul

250.1 --> 257.15
Craig Roberts yeah I don't know I heard

253.97 --> 260.09
a lot from him but he used to be

257.15 --> 264.08
especially like 10 years ago on Alex

260.09 --> 268.60999999999996
Jones regular guest with great insights

264.08 --> 273.26
and yeah he posted this article I bumped

268.61 --> 276.65000000000003
into it and surprisingly through the

273.26 --> 283.45
through my Dutch source Dutch charts is

276.65 --> 283.45
like the new Bruce IT well UFOs

283.93 --> 291.2
anti-globalist type dutch media outlet

288.71 --> 293.35999999999996
thingy that I've also been keeping track

291.2 --> 295.90999999999997
of for a long time I even visited those

293.36 --> 298.51
people 10 years ago to the place where

295.91 --> 301.82000000000005
they are at fooling around with

298.51 --> 304.84999999999997
electrical experiments and [ __ ] but yeah

301.82 --> 306.86
because they do that as well but anyway

304.85 --> 309.95000000000005
I caught on through a Dutch site linked

306.86 --> 312.77000000000004
to his blog and it's great I pushed the

309.95 --> 316.61
link earlier in chat I also posted it

312.77 --> 322.729
around in the on skype so I definitely

316.61 --> 327.1
recommend you read that it's big it's a

322.729 --> 330.05
big article it's like three four pages

327.1 --> 337.03000000000003
it's very condensed yeah but it's just

330.05 --> 337.03000000000003
so well refined so journalistically

339.169 --> 350.639
yes the the journalistic integrity is

348.15 --> 352.979
just very strong with how he written it

350.639 --> 355.169
and how he wrote it that's that's how

352.979 --> 358.8
what I wanted to say anyway I'm gonna go

355.169 --> 362.37
through a chat oh yeah by the way also I

358.8 --> 365.34000000000003
might play the video from David Weiss

362.37 --> 367.52
who just uploaded this all right as I

365.34 --> 372.03
was about to start to show a little clip

367.52 --> 373.5
about some football player I think had

372.03 --> 376.73999999999995
an inquiry with Neil deGrasse Tyson

373.5 --> 382.11
earlier I might play that a little later

376.74 --> 384.509
but first let's go through chat yeah AGM

382.11 --> 386.61
was first it's quite morning but yeah

384.509 --> 389.099
yesterday was quite active so I can

386.61 --> 391.91900000000004
imagine that a lot of people and late

389.099 --> 399.15
night me not so much

391.919 --> 401.639
well little yeah Missouri bear it's good

399.15 --> 407.099
to see you Amanda young good servant

401.639 --> 414.69
Robin Stanley drunken well at 401 Kilda

407.099 --> 419.75
hope the miss Kang they like Ohio the

414.69 --> 419.75
Iona plain the studio 68

422.45 --> 431.3
michael roark Harry Zack hunt yeah good

428.7 --> 431.3
to see you all

435.66 --> 437.69
Oh

449.03 --> 452.14
[Music]

461.71 --> 469.59
all right so I think I figured out

466.33 --> 474.25
something really important about my life

469.59 --> 476.34999999999997
it yeah I have I had a pretty vivid

474.25 --> 479.949
dream even I don't remember any of it

476.35 --> 482.759
but I remember the thought that came out

479.949 --> 485.949
of it it was like a big oversight dream

482.759 --> 488.889
just overlooking all of it from this

485.949 --> 491.889
perspective from this moment in time as

488.889 --> 494.759
to everything very fluid is almost like

491.889 --> 499.72
flicking around photographs with

494.759 --> 501.91
memories attached but yeah I figured out

499.72 --> 505.65000000000003
that basically my main challenge

501.91 --> 508.99
throughout my entire life it's kind of

505.65 --> 510.60999999999996
eluded me because it's so tough that's

508.99 --> 516.57
why it's bid the biggest challenge but I

510.61 --> 523.719
think it is like a stress test because I

516.57 --> 526.1500000000001
always feel that well it's it's kind of

523.719 --> 529.2700000000001
double in a way because hey when I'm

526.15 --> 531.73
very calm when I'm at rest some great

529.27 --> 533.98
qualities could come afloat I can

531.73 --> 536.14
utilize them pretty well in just a very

533.98 --> 541.9590000000001
calm neutral setting but at the same

536.14 --> 545.5889999999999
time when I really focus on something

541.959 --> 547.9899999999999
when I really want something but

545.589 --> 551.44
pressure on me and yeah I can achieve

547.99 --> 554.77
pretty big things I think although the

551.44 --> 557.5
problem is I get lot of obstacles the

554.77 --> 560.8299999999999
stress test it's it's not even about

557.5 --> 563.92
putting the result there as much in

560.83 --> 566.7
retrospect every time it's about living

563.92 --> 570.9399999999999
through the stress that it brings and

566.7 --> 574.3290000000001
just being able to somehow put it in put

570.94 --> 576.22
it in the right spot without like

574.329 --> 578.4399999999999
panicking breaking apart and then

576.22 --> 582.37
retreating because that's a reoccurring

578.44 --> 583.149
theme and makes me feel very bad about

582.37 --> 586.0600000000001
myself

583.149 --> 587.92
every time that happens and yeah at

586.06 --> 591.43
least I'm honest and open and that gives

587.92 --> 593.68
gets me some sympathy I get I guess but

591.43 --> 594.5699999999999
at the same time yeah it's not something

593.68 --> 598.02
I

594.57 --> 603.1500000000001
feel I should just settle with that I

598.02 --> 605.79
have to overcome this somehow and even

603.15 --> 608.0699999999999
earlier on in a way I had these

605.79 --> 610.05
realizations and I will go look up for

608.07 --> 613.2900000000001
it but when I was really young I was

610.05 --> 616.05
just over courageous and I would go buy

613.29 --> 620.61
some weird kind of idea like yeah if I

616.05 --> 623.2099999999999
just go for the maximum possible then

620.61 --> 628.37
I'll kind of get used to it and then

623.21 --> 632.1
afterward grow into it but I just had no

628.37 --> 635.25
oversight as to what would really happen

632.1 --> 639.24
to you also when you subject yourself to

635.25 --> 641.79
maximum stress because I didn't realize

639.24 --> 644.13
back then that is not just about growth

641.79 --> 647.67
through challenges for me you know it is

644.13 --> 653.12
about the stress test itself even that's

647.67 --> 653.12
pretty I don't know it's just something

654.05 --> 659.7299999999999
seems to have cleared up to me it makes

657.66 --> 663.03
sense though every time especially when

659.73 --> 669.3000000000001
I get into this kind of mood or mood

663.03 --> 673.68
when I'm in this state then it focuses

669.3 --> 675.7199999999999
even more on the stress test how do you

673.68 --> 678.8399999999999
get out of it how do you stay stable and

675.72 --> 682.71
how do you even from a from a relatively

678.84 --> 688.22
feeble state keep your composure and

682.71 --> 692.6
then do effective things without then

688.22 --> 692.6
enduring a collapse afterward

693.93 --> 700.77
and I guess that for regular people

696.51 --> 703.23
regular people people people that have

700.77 --> 705.3
this kind of state it must be incredibly

703.23 --> 707.4300000000001
difficult to do anything

705.3 --> 710.1899999999999
it used to be incredibly difficult for

707.43 --> 712.29
me to do anything other than just sit in

710.19 --> 713.61
a corner shaking begging people not to

712.29 --> 715.86
go away because I didn't want to be

713.61 --> 719.46
alone that kind of how it started out

715.86 --> 722.04
for me it's not a good thing and I was

719.46 --> 724.95
forgot about it because it's so yeah

722.04 --> 727.4699999999999
helpless in state an embarrassment you

724.95 --> 729.6
just completely block that out that is a

727.47 --> 732.39
part of you because you don't want that

729.6 --> 738.51
to be a part of you anyway but now I'm

732.39 --> 740.97
much older and I found facing it and I'm

738.51 --> 747.75
gonna figure this out and if I manage to

740.97 --> 753.5400000000001
do it then I might sharpen some tools

747.75 --> 760.05
that others could also copy from me I

753.54 --> 762.8399999999999
guess I don't know but maybe it's the

760.05 --> 765.3599999999999
it's just the the Morning Sun the winter

762.84 --> 770.1
morning Sun energy that just gives me

765.36 --> 774.09
kind of like more courage it's always

770.1 --> 778.32
weird like what if what the undertone of

774.09 --> 782.3000000000001
my feelings is it really changes as to

778.32 --> 784.19
how far I can entertain certain thoughts

782.3 --> 788.329
yeah

784.19 --> 791.0500000000001
it's kind of interesting I guess from a

788.329 --> 794.149
psychological standpoint but anyway

791.05 --> 796.9699999999999
let's get but thank you good servant for

794.149 --> 804.97
the $1 super chair donation by the way I

796.97 --> 808.37
always appreciate a nickel hmm

804.97 --> 813.139
yeah mister I bear some thick gravy in

808.37 --> 815.629
the article yeah let me get let me delve

813.139 --> 818.87
into it a little bit more it what Paul

815.629 --> 822.019
Craig Roberts really got into is about

818.87 --> 824.329
World War two and kind of what really

822.019 --> 828.439
happened from a very historically

824.329 --> 831.5889999999999
neutral standpoint unraveling that the

828.439 --> 834.079
political machinations and the

831.589 --> 837.8190000000001
propaganda and how and how it is

834.079 --> 840.8599999999999
effectively applied and then the

837.819 --> 842.6289999999999
propaganda will have a patriot factor

840.86 --> 844.91
and that will be so subjected to

842.629 --> 850.73
everyone that that patriotism will make

844.91 --> 852.949
people then attack any legitimate

850.73 --> 856.0690000000001
inquiry as to whether it was the truth

852.949 --> 858.41
because the patriotism makes them feel

856.069 --> 861.8
ashamed of their country it's it was

858.41 --> 863.75
really well put down so well and yeah it

861.8 --> 868.579
does reveal a couple of very shameful

863.75 --> 873.1
things about how and what transpired in

868.579 --> 873.0999999999999
in World War two and right before that

873.88 --> 879.47
it's just

876.34 --> 880.94
it's very tough to just summarize an

879.47 --> 884.39
article like that because there's so

880.94 --> 885.98
much rich detail in it really recommend

884.39 --> 889.9
you read it I'm gonna just post in and

885.98 --> 892.4300000000001
check one more time for those that

889.9 --> 911.6899999999999
couldn't reach for it earlier

892.43 --> 914.3599999999999
there it is Matlin guard we don't have a

911.69 --> 916.1
uniform opinion about those things

914.36 --> 917.57
because we are not a cult where

916.1 --> 923.5400000000001
everybody has to think the same thing

917.57 --> 928.1600000000001
and a lot of people have what most of us

923.54 --> 931.25
have doubts about that every terror

928.16 --> 933.5
attack would be real some think none of

931.25 --> 938.36
it is real and I personally don't agree

933.5 --> 940.67
with that and others are just like yeah

938.36 --> 943.4300000000001
I just don't really trust it anymore I

940.67 --> 945.14
hope it's not real but you know the

943.43 --> 946.6099999999999
media you never really know anymore

945.14 --> 950.4499999999999
there they have so many tricks up their

946.61 --> 954.62
sleeves and they apply it wherever they

950.45 --> 958.36
can it seems so yeah you can't just put

954.62 --> 958.36
us all in one basket there buddy

959.62 --> 965.5600000000001
yeah

962.56 --> 965.56
right

974.99 --> 981.89
right yeah well the I you're right and

978.76 --> 988.88
that's always a bit of the trick

981.89 --> 991.31
I guess trick is yeah weather day this

988.88 --> 995.45
is purely hypothetical so I'm not saying

991.31 --> 998.18
what I'm gonna now say has any any kind

995.45 --> 1001.09
of validity concerning that specific

998.18 --> 1003.2199999999999
event in London because I felt to be

1001.09 --> 1006.1600000000001
fair having read up enough to have any

1003.22 --> 1009.49
kind of judgement at this point but yes

1006.16 --> 1014.1899999999999
whether a terrorist attack or like a

1009.49 --> 1018.46
heavy violence situation whether that is

1014.19 --> 1021.49
fake and put in the media or whether it

1018.46 --> 1023.89
was a like a set up a mind control

1021.49 --> 1026.709
victim put there in place and all that

1023.89 --> 1030.73
or whether it is really somebody just

1026.709 --> 1034.54
snapping and corrupted by the low

1030.73 --> 1038.89
threshold of society culturally just

1034.54 --> 1043.959
starts yeah acting out like a maniac in

1038.89 --> 1046.8390000000002
all three situations politicians can

1043.959 --> 1052.51
abuse that situation whether it is real

1046.839 --> 1055.51
or not to push yeah more security that

1052.51 --> 1059.56
all that it can work it always works

1055.51 --> 1061.42
best at those times so it doesn't really

1059.56 --> 1063.94
matter in the end whether it is real or

1061.42 --> 1066.6100000000001
not if something like that happens and

1063.94 --> 1068.71
it rubs off on the people through the

1066.61 --> 1070.9299999999998
news and all that whatever or just

1068.71 --> 1073.1200000000001
rumors among one another because people

1070.93 --> 1077.26
even aggravated with one another just

1073.12 --> 1079.57
bad habits the boredom just bore so they

1077.26 --> 1081.49
just talk about this [ __ ] and then make

1079.57 --> 1086.35
it worse in their minds and spread

1081.49 --> 1087.01
paranoia about it but yeah whether it is

1086.35 --> 1091.7099999999998
real or not

1087.01 --> 1095.16
of course politics will try to use it to

1091.71 --> 1097.65
push more things like

1095.16 --> 1098.88
gun control in the United States and

1097.65 --> 1103.74
England that wouldn't be irrelevant

1098.88 --> 1106.1100000000001
anymore or yeah banning of Nige then

1103.74 --> 1108.15
like literally nobody could have them

1106.11 --> 1110.3999999999999
anymore and like they'd become illegal

1108.15 --> 1113.6100000000001
and you everybody has to know use

1110.4 --> 1115.0500000000002
plastic knives and something ridiculous

1113.61 --> 1119.4299999999998
like that I don't think it will ever

1115.05 --> 1122.1599999999999
come that far I hope it doesn't really

1119.43 --> 1126.18
matter if something like that happens

1122.16 --> 1129.27
and it creates aggravation or tension or

1126.18 --> 1132.44
fear then politician will use it whether

1129.27 --> 1132.44
it is real or not so

1141.04 --> 1144.04
Wow

1146.309 --> 1150.549
every questions there I guess I can take

1150.159 --> 1152.769
it

1150.549 --> 1155.769
you know normally I'd say like youth can

1152.769 --> 1158.289
we please maybe not get into that heavy

1155.769 --> 1160.989
[ __ ] but I guess I can take it right has

1158.289 --> 1164.679
had a little radical Islam has anything

1160.989 --> 1166.8400000000001
to do with it well I think that I think

1164.679 --> 1174.3400000000001
that that word is kind of already an

1166.84 --> 1179.379
abomination because it's like but can

1174.34 --> 1181.4189999999999
you like when something is radicalized

1179.379 --> 1186.389
to the point where it just becomes

1181.419 --> 1190.96
violent and in political control then

1186.389 --> 1193.359
the supposed torch they carry which is

1190.96 --> 1195.3400000000001
mostly Islam if you really look into

1193.359 --> 1200.379
that that doesn't make any sense so it

1195.34 --> 1203.4399999999998
is Pharisees the radical Islam tag you

1200.379 --> 1207.399
know and think about Islam whatever you

1203.44 --> 1210.46
want or people that believe in Prophet

1207.399 --> 1212.7389999999998
Mohammed and all that in the Koran think

1210.46 --> 1216.099
about it what you want that that phrase

1212.739 --> 1219.779
radical Islam is kind of just wrong and

1216.099 --> 1223.029
is used really to put the general

1219.779 --> 1225.239
Islamic world in a bad light and now the

1223.029 --> 1227.769
in my personal opinion they have

1225.239 --> 1230.909
cultural problems and issues and

1227.769 --> 1235.71
especially like the black and white

1230.909 --> 1238.0900000000001
approach has problems it's it has

1235.71 --> 1240.729
benefits and it has problems and there's

1238.09 --> 1243.369
just issues with that I guess cultural

1240.729 --> 1247.8690000000001
issues is just I wasn't programmed that

1243.369 --> 1251.9499999999998
way you could say but that phrase

1247.869 --> 1255.6899999999998
radical Islam to be terrorist that is it

1251.95 --> 1258.429
is kind of an insult because Islam I

1255.69 --> 1262.269
don't think it really does allow it has

1258.429 --> 1265.539
stories about yeah conquering and stuff

1262.269 --> 1269.999
and but also rules that come with that

1265.539 --> 1269.999
and that contrasts everything it does

1270.5 --> 1279.99
it's not right if you ever read the

1277.14 --> 1284.97
Koran no I haven't but I do know

1279.99 --> 1289.26
somebody that has and yeah have you ever

1284.97 --> 1290.94
read the Bible you know it's not like

1289.26 --> 1294.87
everything in there is all just

1290.94 --> 1299.88
hunky-dory obviously and then you have

1294.87 --> 1303.3899999999999
but it's that's this well guess what I'm

1299.88 --> 1308.93
I'm pretty convinced or at least there

1303.39 --> 1312.5700000000002
should be some like Imams that are just

1308.93 --> 1315.45
much more serious don't get caught up in

1312.57 --> 1318.24
political or power play that say exactly

1315.45 --> 1321.54
the same thing about in certain Koran

1318.24 --> 1326.31
situations like yeah those were that was

1321.54 --> 1327.03
a radical time that's that's not really

1326.31 --> 1331.62
what it's about

1327.03 --> 1339.3899999999999
so yeah call me an islam apologist or

1331.62 --> 1341.7299999999998
whatever there is something goes on with

1339.39 --> 1345.3000000000002
that and now I don't seriously I don't

1341.73 --> 1348.96
want Europe to become like Islamic I

1345.3 --> 1351.78
don't want that system that is still

1348.96 --> 1353.79
applied in the Middle East some

1351.78 --> 1357.24
countries I don't want things to be

1353.79 --> 1360.72
forced upon anyone here that doesn't

1357.24 --> 1363.36
seem Islamic to me either you know if

1360.72 --> 1367.49
you're really it is so odd how it all

1363.36 --> 1367.49
works it's like a

1368.539 --> 1375.979
it's just complicated but yeah

1372.469 --> 1379.3690000000001
terrorists just going on and blowing

1375.979 --> 1382.6390000000001
stuff up and [ __ ] for because everyone

1379.369 --> 1390.049
is evil and not following the hardcore

1382.639 --> 1392.139
code yeah that's I don't see I don't

1390.049 --> 1392.139
know

1402.84 --> 1408.81
I'm just gonna stop talking about this

1404.91 --> 1414.5600000000002
until like I get somebody that is a

1408.81 --> 1417.6599999999999
little bit more red in it maybe I should

1414.56 --> 1419.82
maybe should try it next time I bring

1417.66 --> 1423.39
this subject up I'll I think I'll get

1419.82 --> 1426.96
Rhys on because he here at the ground

1423.39 --> 1429.6000000000001
and this is kind of what I'm trying to

1426.96 --> 1433.32
put out here is also his tenth point and

1429.6 --> 1436.53
that is also what I thought it's like

1433.32 --> 1443.85
yes there's problems but there's just

1436.53 --> 1450.72
some deception going on and from inside

1443.85 --> 1452.99
and out with them that big big religious

1450.72 --> 1452.99
group

1456.86 --> 1459.76
anyway

1473.0 --> 1481.97
right Matt lingard yeah I guess you make

1475.909 --> 1484.3090000000002
a good point but the thing is if you

1481.97 --> 1490.01
there's just it just doesn't make any

1484.309 --> 1492.26
sense look II like Islam calls for for

1490.01 --> 1494.72
the death of unbelievers according to

1492.26 --> 1498.049
what you said but is that really

1494.72 --> 1501.32
supposed to be the way it is because

1498.049 --> 1501.98
from what I remember people telling me

1501.32 --> 1506.6589999999999
about it

1501.98 --> 1508.549
is that it actually tolerates all the

1506.659 --> 1515.45
religions specifically there's like a

1508.549 --> 1518.96
code to do that and it's not about

1515.45 --> 1524.809
unbelievers it's just like don't be anti

1518.96 --> 1526.88
God specifically I think I don't know

1524.809 --> 1530.27
it's it's complicated and we're calling

1526.88 --> 1533.1200000000001
Christianity toothless well that

1530.27 --> 1536.6589999999999
shouldn't be that's incorrect according

1533.12 --> 1538.6299999999999
to the Bible too so you could say that

1536.659 --> 1541.8400000000001
culturally from the top down

1538.63 --> 1546.169
Christianity has really been weakened

1541.84 --> 1551.3899999999999
Islam from the top down seems to be more

1546.169 --> 1554.0590000000002
weaponized but they're both deviations

1551.39 --> 1557.8300000000002
really from the core balance frequency

1554.059 --> 1557.83
of what it's really about

1563.45 --> 1570.1490000000001
yeah well Matt lingard now you just do

1567.72 --> 1572.309
you people can do the same thing with

1570.149 --> 1572.9399999999998
the Bible or any freaking book for that

1572.309 --> 1579.35
matter

1572.94 --> 1579.3500000000001
that doesn't prove that it's all just

1579.44 --> 1583.19
why don't you get this

1597.76 --> 1604.08
oh right yeah well this sorry that's

1600.33 --> 1604.08
that's not acceptable

1624.33 --> 1635.28
right Missouri bear well the thing about

1631.14 --> 1637.5900000000001
that is is that the processes of that

1635.28 --> 1641.79
the effect as what you say the cry to

1637.59 --> 1646.1699999999998
heaven that is grounded in logos and

1641.79 --> 1650.76
those things are also reflected within

1646.17 --> 1655.41
both books it's a different approach

1650.76 --> 1659.7
it's not finding some kind of extreme

1655.41 --> 1662.22
out out extreme thing and then saying

1659.7 --> 1666.56
the entire book is about that that would

1662.22 --> 1667.77
be does just as dissing genuine

1666.56 --> 1672.45
disingenuous

1667.77 --> 1675.3899999999999
as taking one of my bad moments or when

1672.45 --> 1681.3300000000002
I was like really angry like well you

1675.39 --> 1684.5700000000002
remember is it like and then quote

1681.33 --> 1688.4399999999998
mining me in that taking one sentence

1684.57 --> 1691.05
and then saying that is what I am about

1688.44 --> 1695.5800000000002
that's exactly what the trolls do so why

1691.05 --> 1700.3999999999999
would you do that with these religious

1695.58 --> 1700.3999999999999
books do you understand me

1722.51 --> 1730.58
all right Oh Matt lingard look that's

1727.01 --> 1733.8799999999999
the stance that is how they defend their

1730.58 --> 1737.5
book in a crazy world okay

1733.88 --> 1740.0
I'd say that I don't know 500 years ago

1737.5 --> 1742.1
something like that I'm a little more I

1740.0 --> 1744.83
think that probably a lot of Christians

1742.1 --> 1746.74
were kind of exactly the same way and

1744.83 --> 1750.049
they might have even been more

1746.74 --> 1754.66
aggressive or punishing with that as

1750.049 --> 1754.66
well so

1762.9 --> 1766.049
[Music]

1766.779 --> 1771.639
no AGM

1768.499 --> 1778.309
no that's ignorance what you're saying

1771.639 --> 1781.34
it's not word salad there's a lot of

1778.309 --> 1790.45
very interesting things also going on in

1781.34 --> 1790.4499999999998
the Quran it is I don't know

1828.21 --> 1845.669
yeah great talk thanks thanks for

1833.45 --> 1848.009
regurgitating the worst thanks yeah yeah

1845.669 --> 1851.1000000000001
I can tell you another side of all that

1848.009 --> 1853.559
too by the way because I'm pretty sure

1851.1 --> 1857.1899999999998
that into that society and yeah it is

1853.559 --> 1860.279
pretty gruesome but I don't think in

1857.19 --> 1862.679
that society you're gonna be sneakily

1860.279 --> 1865.86
tricked and ripped off or somebody's

1862.679 --> 1867.749
just gonna steal your [ __ ] and because

1865.86 --> 1871.34
of some power structure get away with it

1867.749 --> 1876.99
that easily because it is so rough

1871.34 --> 1883.35
nobody gets the chance to basically act

1876.99 --> 1890.029
out small hat tactics on the people much

1883.35 --> 1893.509
less that is also part of that so yeah

1890.029 --> 1893.509
is what it is

1893.83 --> 1902.769
and I don't come down that [ __ ] you know

1895.96 --> 1907.8990000000001
but in a way also every time I hear

1902.769 --> 1909.789
about that I'm always interested you

1907.899 --> 1913.32
know maybe it's just the deeper

1909.789 --> 1915.61
curiosity as to okay if some gay guy or

1913.32 --> 1918.639
declared gay is thrown off a building

1915.61 --> 1921.58
like what really happened what did he

1918.639 --> 1922.149
really do what's going on who was that

1921.58 --> 1925.269
guy

1922.149 --> 1929.9189999999999
they say he's gay what he really gay was

1925.269 --> 1933.58
a political situation what is maybe you

1929.919 --> 1940.6290000000001
don't know this do they tell you do you

1933.58 --> 1944.1999999999998
really know you know just because the

1940.629 --> 1946.57
news or even the officials put out from

1944.2 --> 1948.96
their side put out a story about it is

1946.57 --> 1953.049
that does that make that absolutely

1948.96 --> 1954.8790000000001
unquestionably real do you know is there

1953.049 --> 1960.21
a journalist going there and actually

1954.879 --> 1960.2099999999998
figure out the story there

1969.87 --> 1979.8
don't let their stories burn mark your

1977.38 --> 1979.8000000000002
soul

1984.37 --> 1989.25
I think that's a good way to describe it

2010.48 --> 2017.859
yes they lie Ohio exactly

2013.799 --> 2023.32
just like with Christianity it's about

2017.859 --> 2028.269
the individual and it always was in a

2023.32 --> 2032.32
way and there's just certain inner

2028.269 --> 2035.139
workings that you can't get rid of it

2032.32 --> 2038.23
whether it is a group doing all the

2035.139 --> 2041.32
nasty behavior or whether it is a

2038.23 --> 2044.009
cultural thing that slipped in or some

2041.32 --> 2047.2
kind of rigidity with these side effects

2044.009 --> 2049.389
they it always comes back the darkness

2047.2 --> 2051.2400000000002
always comes back this is something that

2049.389 --> 2058.319
I've said before it is very practical

2051.24 --> 2063.089
it's not just a boozy idea no it does

2058.319 --> 2068.74
every group every society every belief

2063.089 --> 2071.52
has characteristic dark sides just like

2068.74 --> 2073.8689999999997
every individual has their correct

2071.52 --> 2076.109
characteristic ego that they have to

2073.869 --> 2076.109
deal with

2090.95 --> 2093.6389999999997
you

2100.77 --> 2112.569
yeah Missouri bear sis's please yeah I

2110.589 --> 2120.2799999999997
know that there's a big issue with that

2112.569 --> 2124.75
weird stuff I know I have my own crazy

2120.28 --> 2133.3190000000004
stories about that okay like this is a

2124.75 --> 2139.39
long time ago we my parents got to know

2133.319 --> 2142.599
like an old block Berber from the

2139.39 --> 2147.73
Mountains of Morocco who was well they

2142.599 --> 2150.7000000000003
he he presented himself as Islamic and

2147.73 --> 2154.42
he was typically of the rigid old block

2150.7 --> 2156.3999999999996
character still very respectful but yeah

2154.42 --> 2159.64
he had weird issues too because for

2156.4 --> 2162.76
example he drank alcohol and still he

2159.64 --> 2165.7
was like no I have yet the bed was like

2162.76 --> 2168.25
a weird bit dubious about him so yet

2165.7 --> 2172.48
it's just a person person with issues

2168.25 --> 2175.69
and but at some point like me and a body

2172.48 --> 2179.859
were just fooling around and just

2175.69 --> 2186.4900000000002
running around and getting crazy it was

2179.859 --> 2189.91
like did you say that like kids getting

2186.49 --> 2191.5299999999997
a bit screwy around and like trying to

2189.91 --> 2195.64
annoy one not to run one after one

2191.53 --> 2198.6090000000004
another and just get into small fights

2195.64 --> 2201.0099999999998
and [ __ ] and like we did that one time

2198.609 --> 2204.88
where that guy was in the room and for

2201.01 --> 2206.38
some weird reason he got really insulted

2204.88 --> 2212.319
by itself was all wrong

2206.38 --> 2216.54
and then he act and he actually then was

2212.319 --> 2219.73
planning to basically freaking rape us

2216.54 --> 2222.97
and then like my parents or my mother

2219.73 --> 2226.47
was even like in in the house and it

2222.97 --> 2226.47
seemed to me I was like

2226.779 --> 2232.45
I don't get it like this is weird

2230.319 --> 2234.3089999999997
and I was old enough that I wouldn't

2232.45 --> 2237.0989999999997
take that [ __ ] you know I was plenty of

2234.309 --> 2239.4100000000003
strong but it was just weird and after

2237.099 --> 2241.4500000000003
that well yeah my mother found out and

2239.41 --> 2244.89
got really pissed off like you can't do

2241.45 --> 2247.359
that here you can't do that so wrong and

2244.89 --> 2250.479
then after that he didn't really come

2247.359 --> 2257.319
back but I still remember that well that

2250.479 --> 2259.989
almost happened it's just it seemed like

2257.319 --> 2262.269
to him that really was the thing to do

2259.989 --> 2265.66
he thought he was going to do the right

2262.269 --> 2269.0789999999997
thing that is it it's just it was

2265.66 --> 2272.6499999999996
surreal that is what I remembered then

2269.079 --> 2273.3590000000004
this is like 30 years ago or something I

2272.65 --> 2280.239
think

2273.359 --> 2282.7
yeah around 30 years ago but I didn't

2280.239 --> 2284.68
hate the guy I thought he was kind of

2282.7 --> 2293.109
fascinating yeah but that part was like

2284.68 --> 2295.18
what I don't know where he didn't even

2293.109 --> 2297.569
get to a point where he where he touched

2295.18 --> 2300.94
us indecently or something he was just

2297.569 --> 2302.13
he wasn't going to do that even like

2300.94 --> 2305.159
declared it

2302.13 --> 2305.159
[Music]

2308.269 --> 2313.0989999999997
but yeah does that make him a typical

2311.719 --> 2320.989
Muslim or something

2313.099 --> 2331.759
no even later I well I I have at times

2320.989 --> 2333.589
talked to like serious is it anyway

2331.759 --> 2336.199
people that study the Koran and all and

2333.589 --> 2339.639
they said like but that's a Berber

2336.199 --> 2347.529
they're like they're crazy you know they

2339.639 --> 2347.529
they don't do it right so yeah you know

2348.039 --> 2353.5890000000004
what do you do with all of that

2366.18 --> 2370.73
yeah crazy things happened in this world

2372.67 --> 2375.76
[Music]

2399.31 --> 2409.96
right anyway yeah hmm

2406.09 --> 2412.48
also yeah about tomorrow I don't know if

2409.96 --> 2414.51
I am gonna do a show tomorrow for a

2412.48 --> 2418.48
certain because I got an invite from

2414.51 --> 2424.2400000000002
good friend librarian to go to a party

2418.48 --> 2427.33
over a Rotterdam and I don't know if I'm

2424.24 --> 2429.7599999999998
if I'm gonna wake up as good feeling as

2427.33 --> 2432.0299999999997
I did today then I will I definitely

2429.76 --> 2436.51
want to go out for a moment you know

2432.03 --> 2440.3700000000003
just get out and that's the music and

2436.51 --> 2440.3700000000003
just see what it's like

2443.12 --> 2449.0899999999997
see if it is still something that I can

2445.73 --> 2455.78
enjoy you know and and it's gonna be

2449.09 --> 2458.57
mostly wave electro and 80s type music

2455.78 --> 2462.07
so already know kind of what style that

2458.57 --> 2467.6000000000004
is it's not very satanic or anything or

2462.07 --> 2469.73
aggressive so I think I'll have a good

2467.6 --> 2472.19
time there if I'm gonna go I'm not sure

2469.73 --> 2478.19
yet but it's yeah it's not in the

2472.19 --> 2480.35
evening it's in the afternoon so but

2478.19 --> 2484.25
yeah just saying that there might not be

2480.35 --> 2491.45
a early bird show tomorrow I'm not sure

2484.25 --> 2498.26
yet we'll see okay yeah let's ask a

2491.45 --> 2500.56
little Flat Earth in here kind of see if

2498.26 --> 2500.5600000000004
I can

2500.569 --> 2503.109
what

2519.41 --> 2530.7799999999997
not right weird uh hold on see

2538.66 --> 2547.269
right okay I'm gonna play David watch

2541.93 --> 2549.7889999999998
this video let's see hey what's up Neil

2547.269 --> 2551.9799999999996
I got like a super important question

2549.789 --> 2554.349
for you that I've been wondering like

2551.98 --> 2558.549
mother like okay isn't the world round

2554.349 --> 2559.569
or black because if so if the whoop if

2558.549 --> 2563.109
the world is round

2559.569 --> 2572.019
why isn't the water falling out the

2563.109 --> 2573.43
space I don't see space McHale you asked

2572.019 --> 2577.0
a very important question

2573.43 --> 2579.7
this concept had eluded all of humanity

2577.0 --> 2581.829
for centuries in one part of earth was

2579.7 --> 2583.93
flat why because it looked black and

2581.829 --> 2587.23
they proposed the same arguments you did

2583.93 --> 2588.7889999999998
if it was round stuff would fall off on

2587.23 --> 2593.7400000000002
the other side you can't have people

2588.789 --> 2596.349
standing upside down on a round thing we

2593.74 --> 2598.18
partners was quiet before we had

2596.349 --> 2600.46
seagoing vessels that would be beyond

2598.18 --> 2601.8689999999997
the horizon recognizing that there has

2600.46 --> 2605.5
to be a curved there cuz the ship

2601.869 --> 2607.2400000000002
doesn't always stay in view the ship

2605.5 --> 2608.859
eventually disappeared you can chase

2607.24 --> 2611.41
after him and you can keep disappearing

2608.859 --> 2615.509
they keep doing this this would count as

2611.41 --> 2615.509
evidence that Earth's surface was curved

2616.349 --> 2624.2200000000003
there is without the need of curvature

2621.73 --> 2626.339
or without the need of a physical

2624.22 --> 2629.3689999999997
obstruction for that matter

2626.339 --> 2638.5389999999998
you concealments it's not obstruction

2629.369 --> 2638.539
it's concealment let's get that sorted

2639.559 --> 2648.299
we increase the focal length and

2642.539 --> 2653.5490000000004
increase resolution we can resolve that

2648.299 --> 2657.859
coin in its entirety as you can see

2653.549 --> 2657.859
bottom of the coin shining

2660.859 --> 2665.0589999999997
but what about the water how come it's

2662.989 --> 2667.16
not just spilling off we had to come to

2665.059 --> 2668.69
a deep understanding of gravity we had

2667.16 --> 2671.1189999999997
to come to a deeper understanding of

2668.69 --> 2697.2490000000003
businesses we had to come to a deep

2671.119 --> 2699.109
understanding of gravity pulls towards

2697.249 --> 2701.209
the center of the earth in every

2699.109 --> 2703.0989999999997
direction so you can walk around to

2701.209 --> 2705.2889999999998
quote the bottom of the earth gravity is

2703.099 --> 2706.7290000000003
pulling up towards it water here towards

2705.289 --> 2708.38
the center of the earth water here

2706.729 --> 2710.779
towards the center towards the center

2708.38 --> 2713.7490000000003
and the earth is big enough so you think

2710.779 --> 2716.799
it's flat but if you step away like the

2713.749 --> 2716.799
Apollo astronauts did

2724.18 --> 2728.279
nothing here is the beautiful glow

2737.9 --> 2743.42
that is hurt and adrift in space now if

2741.95 --> 2745.43
you want to think earth is flat but you

2743.42 --> 2746.96
know the moon is round and the Sun is

2745.43 --> 2748.6099999999997
round and through a telescope all the

2746.96 --> 2751.34
other planets around you're stuck

2748.61 --> 2753.38
drawing a solar system with a round Sun

2751.34 --> 2755.48
and around mercury around Venus flat

2753.38 --> 2757.88
earth round Mars round you put her

2755.48 --> 2760.01
around round everything else that's kind

2757.88 --> 2761.51
of untenable so anyhow it's because we

2760.01 --> 2763.28
understand gravity it's because we

2761.51 --> 2774.11
understand gravity it's because we

2763.28 --> 2776.15
understand ground we start asking so

2774.11 --> 2778.69
anyhow because we understand gravity

2776.15 --> 2778.69
that we know

2785.69 --> 2793.339
I love this guy sorry I can't help it

2788.299 --> 2797.95
it's is so funny it's wrong and it's so

2793.339 --> 2797.95
funny from my perspective I guess

2798.579 --> 2804.079
yeah well indeed it does seem like it

2802.01 --> 2806.329
was tinker tailored for children I

2804.079 --> 2810.2000000000003
wouldn't be surprised if they actually

2806.329 --> 2817.01
played this kind of stuff in schools for

2810.2 --> 2821.96
children like like I had seen astronaut

2817.01 --> 2824.1400000000003
things in in school when I was like 7 or

2821.96 --> 2824.14
something

2824.319 --> 2829.5389999999998
so I betcha that they'll bring this up

2845.249 --> 2855.3599999999997
but

2848.07 --> 2859.76
all right I don't know I still yeah let

2855.36 --> 2863.34
me get back to to me all right

2859.76 --> 2868.17
it is of course that yeah he is talking

2863.34 --> 2870.4500000000003
nonsense right but if you're not that

2868.17 --> 2874.02
insightful if you don't have a lot of

2870.45 --> 2877.5299999999997
backdrop background history of them like

2874.02 --> 2879.84
a kid then that sounds all very reliable

2877.53 --> 2883.3500000000004
and you'd probably just take it over and

2879.84 --> 2886.32
use that to believe in the globe at that

2883.35 --> 2891.0899999999997
age but yeah how long are those

2886.32 --> 2893.34
arguments really gonna last night work

2891.09 --> 2895.1400000000003
if you're just being defensive when

2893.34 --> 2897.42
being confronted with flat earth things

2895.14 --> 2899.49
like knew this and that and you run away

2897.42 --> 2901.98
they are that but if you're actually

2899.49 --> 2904.35
gonna confront flat earthers with that

2901.98 --> 2908.82
then yeah you happens what happens

2904.35 --> 2910.95
exactly what always happens you you feel

2908.82 --> 2912.75
you get to feel really stupid because it

2910.95 --> 2916.7999999999997
turns out the arguments didn't make any

2912.75 --> 2921.27
sense and then you can go nuts into like

2916.8 --> 2923.9700000000003
a a bolt hard a bit or you get obsessed

2921.27 --> 2928.38
with it every day go to the flatter Flat

2923.97 --> 2932.2799999999997
Earth hangouts to troll or yeah you take

2928.38 --> 2935.96
a step back think like hmm maybe it was

2932.28 --> 2935.96
like kind of like a santa claus story

2937.88 --> 2946.25
and in my personal opinion I still think

2941.02 --> 2953.84
that the whole globe an outerspace

2946.25 --> 2956.63
concept might still be doable as like a

2953.84 --> 2957.26
santa claus thing that society could

2956.63 --> 2960.02
uphold

2957.26 --> 2962.9300000000003
up to a certain age that would make

2960.02 --> 2965.69
sense to me now of course the ones that

2962.93 --> 2969.02
would be making that all the footage you

2965.69 --> 2973.58
know that stuff that kids will utilize

2969.02 --> 2976.7
yet they they can't be freaking a you

2973.58 --> 2981.14
abusing that to program children with

2976.7 --> 2984.3799999999997
other stupid things you know but that

2981.14 --> 2988.19
doesn't mean that just a space myth

2984.38 --> 2990.05
could not be temporarily uphold for

2988.19 --> 2994.1
children to dream about and then later

2990.05 --> 2996.34
figure out oh wait it really was just a

2994.1 --> 2996.3399999999997
dream

2998.0 --> 3005.17
I don't know I don't know if this can be

3002.44 --> 3007.66
but I was thought that would be a

3005.17 --> 3014.069
sensible solution to it all to just move

3007.66 --> 3014.069
on and not and not like

3017.97 --> 3026.52
not like completely just wipe it out the

3022.079 --> 3030.69
idea I think that as a fantasy it is

3026.52 --> 3034.41
interesting should just not be forced

3030.69 --> 3037.369
upon people as if it were reality on a

3034.41 --> 3037.3689999999997
permanent basis

3037.579 --> 3043.559
so yeah I guess I'm speaking out too

3041.64 --> 3044.8799999999997
early in a situation where it's still

3043.559 --> 3048.8390000000004
hard first is hard

3044.88 --> 3051.27
I guess maybe maybe a lot of other

3048.839 --> 3054.69
people out there kind of have the same

3051.27 --> 3057.47
idea I don't know I think there probably

3054.69 --> 3057.4700000000003
are

3074.49 --> 3078.6499999999996
what sorry bear

3079.59 --> 3090.29
spaceship pictures now Missouri Baird

3082.86 --> 3090.29
NOAA that's the issue

3100.99 --> 3106.839
what what he is saying helps exclaim the

3104.44 --> 3110.38
abundant supply of drugs of their

3106.839 --> 3113.7
various kinds what what are you what is

3110.38 --> 3113.7000000000003
everybody talking about here

3125.16 --> 3128.99
robbing Stanley huh

3150.66 --> 3153.41
that's

3153.61 --> 3158.83
yeah that's kind of fascinating in a way

3156.28 --> 3160.8100000000004
Roman Stanley good interesting that you

3158.83 --> 3162.88
brought that up from Stanley says I

3160.81 --> 3166.42
wanted my brother to go to the moon not

3162.88 --> 3169.12
Vietnam well in a way you could say like

3166.42 --> 3175.9300000000003
wave what was going on during that time

3169.12 --> 3179.41
it was almost like an extra push they

3175.93 --> 3181.75
gave you almost a false cultural option

3179.41 --> 3185.92
to choose for like either you go to war

3181.75 --> 3188.89
or we divert all that money that goes

3185.92 --> 3192.0
through the war to do something more

3188.89 --> 3195.67
peaceful like going to outer space

3192.0 --> 3198.13
so they kind of forced it with the peace

3195.67 --> 3203.62
option in a way it's probably part of

3198.13 --> 3206.4100000000003
the trick that'll ingrain it much more

3203.62 --> 3208.5
because then it is directly in the

3206.41 --> 3215.19
people's feeling in what they want

3208.5 --> 3215.19
associated with peace what do you think

3225.55 --> 3236.29
yes I can imagine it was but the real

3230.5 --> 3241.39
power laid with logos with you wanting

3236.29 --> 3243.7799999999997
peace and they just took that as a tag

3241.39 --> 3247.8399999999997
as a flag like yeah we're for peace and

3243.78 --> 3251.98
yeah that the desperation it's it's just

3247.84 --> 3255.8500000000004
like just like political desperation

3251.98 --> 3258.76
like oh we got to pick anyone that could

3255.85 --> 3261.46
counter that even though the one you're

3258.76 --> 3265.0
going to be picking maybe just the other

3261.46 --> 3272.41
hand of the same thing that is giving

3265.0 --> 3275.19
you the control opposition option and

3272.41 --> 3275.19
it's brutal

3277.16 --> 3281.3289999999997
you know if you only get to see two

3279.41 --> 3285.0789999999997
options all the time and you got

3281.329 --> 3289.73
feelings in response to both of it then

3285.079 --> 3292.7000000000003
how would you know that there may be

3289.73 --> 3295.789
other options that completely exclude

3292.7 --> 3302.18
them as well and how would you know they

3295.789 --> 3308.0
were viable that's part of the the

3302.18 --> 3309.74
problem when that happens if you get in

3308.0 --> 3314.42
talked Rene did with two opposing

3309.74 --> 3316.16
choices then eventually most people will

3314.42 --> 3319.9700000000003
start to believe those are the only two

3316.16 --> 3323.8999999999996
choices and how would you start up any

3319.97 --> 3325.7889999999998
other direction then because people

3323.9 --> 3328.25
would think not it's not gonna work

3325.789 --> 3330.9500000000003
that's been a big problem I think in

3328.25 --> 3334.609
American politics also for a very long

3330.95 --> 3338.1189999999997
time it's just that that dichotomy so

3334.609 --> 3341.0589999999997
tough to get away from and they all show

3338.119 --> 3346.539
their devious natures at time show that

3341.059 --> 3349.94
they play the same methods that they're

3346.539 --> 3354.309
that they both can be corrupted in the

3349.94 --> 3354.309
same ways go along to get along

3367.63 --> 3370.38
hmm

3400.38 --> 3403.069
hmm

3433.34 --> 3442.7400000000002
yeah war is awful it unravels so much

3439.37 --> 3447.44
it's not just money it also unravels a

3442.74 --> 3447.4399999999996
lot of energy takes away hope

3462.47 --> 3465.47
yeah

3479.36 --> 3490.21
poke urine that's completely wrong this

3486.05 --> 3490.21
is complete false assumption they're

3490.57 --> 3495.9500000000003
ridiculous

3492.25 --> 3497.6
like the Bible explains definitely what

3495.95 --> 3502.73
we see up there it basically gives the

3497.6 --> 3506.0899999999997
foundation lights slides that's kind of

3502.73 --> 3511.82
like exactly what I say except it's very

3506.09 --> 3514.8700000000003
minimal right paulcurran and flat

3511.82 --> 3518.27
earthers have a wide variety of

3514.87 --> 3522.17
explanations for what it is when we look

3518.27 --> 3524.62
up a lot it's much more refined me

3522.17 --> 3528.38
personally I have a very detailed

3524.62 --> 3530.24
approach to it and potential causes

3528.38 --> 3532.46
which are still kind of vague but at

3530.24 --> 3534.7999999999997
least I have some conceptualization of

3532.46 --> 3540.38
our holographic light phenomena can

3534.8 --> 3547.5800000000004
manifest like that imaginations right

3540.38 --> 3550.01
but yeah it does explain so much and yet

3547.58 --> 3556.67
the globe is literally going with

3550.01 --> 3560.3
nonsense going with with giant giant

3556.67 --> 3565.01
giant endless what-ifs presuppositions

3560.3 --> 3568.3700000000003
and just making [ __ ] up making digital

3565.01 --> 3571.3900000000003
paintings and then divining them like

3568.37 --> 3574.13
throwing bonus or reading tea leaves

3571.39 --> 3576.74
making up what they are supposed to be

3574.13 --> 3579.07
and then see if it mathematically works

3576.74 --> 3579.0699999999997
out

3590.68 --> 3597.569
no it doesn't Howard Moore it absolutely

3594.579 --> 3601.7200000000003
does not globe goes with math

3597.569 --> 3606.569
conceptualizations with a giant lack of

3601.72 --> 3606.569
physical empirical confirmation

3606.749 --> 3616.569
that's not exact science that is a lot

3611.799 --> 3618.309
of math tooling and frameworks like a

3616.569 --> 3620.95
house of cards supposed to represent

3618.309 --> 3623.9990000000003
something but when you actually test it

3620.95 --> 3623.999
out yeah falls flat

3639.5 --> 3643.989
[Music]

3653.84 --> 3663.65
math-based yeah but that's the thing

3658.05 --> 3663.65
about math isn't it it's a deduction but

3663.68 --> 3670.52
if you on purpose

3667.7 --> 3673.9199999999996
misinterpret an observation when you

3670.52 --> 3676.89
empirically tests that observation in a

3673.92 --> 3679.44
wide variety of options and you can

3676.89 --> 3681.6299999999997
definitely conclude that the original

3679.44 --> 3683.7000000000003
globe assumption is not real like for

3681.63 --> 3686.61
example the horizon being a leading edge

3683.7 --> 3687.48
of a sphere right geometrically that's

3686.61 --> 3690.3
incorrect

3687.48 --> 3692.76
well yeah your math can be based on

3690.3 --> 3695.3100000000004
observation but it's not following up on

3692.76 --> 3697.6200000000003
that observation to try and actually

3695.31 --> 3702.56
confirm whether it is real or not

3697.62 --> 3702.56
it's just riding with the assumption

3706.99 --> 3710.06
[Music]

3714.73 --> 3723.43
hey I haven't seen it more colored yeah

3721.599 --> 3724.96
funny that you bring that up I punted it

3723.43 --> 3729.3689999999997
out like half a year ago or something

3724.96 --> 3733.48
that the Google globe map when you yeah

3729.369 --> 3735.609
online that if you can see that there is

3733.48 --> 3738.609
a scale indicator in the corner and as

3735.609 --> 3740.23
you literally rotate that globe so you

3738.609 --> 3746.17
don't zoom in or anything you should

3740.23 --> 3749.32
stay the same apparent distance and the

3746.17 --> 3752.25
scale changes as you move around it so

3749.32 --> 3755.29
literally it's not the scale that

3752.25 --> 3765.55
perfect globe model it's not the scale

3755.29 --> 3770.94
at all and the proof is right there now

3765.55 --> 3770.94
it's a spherical projection

3774.35 --> 3777.58
that's not the scale

3783.17 --> 3785.859
it's

3798.79 --> 3808.18
really poke urine you think so I have my

3804.43 --> 3810.46
I get why you say that it's just seen it

3808.18 --> 3811.5699999999997
that could be refined a lot better

3810.46 --> 3814.54
paulcurran

3811.57 --> 3816.76
saying that I gotta take you mean david

3814.54 --> 3819.55
icke so two of the elites a useful idiot

3816.76 --> 3822.28
well that's how they probably regard him

3819.55 --> 3825.9700000000003
but they regard anything like that if

3822.28 --> 3830.5
they can if they can what they did i

3825.97 --> 3833.74
think is allow truth tellers to come

3830.5 --> 3838.9
afloat and then see if they would

3833.74 --> 3841.8999999999996
naturally arrive to globe related myths

3838.9 --> 3844.57
like for example aliens or david icke he

3841.9 --> 3847.21
created reptilians and he's still

3844.57 --> 3849.1000000000004
entertaining the moon both being a

3847.21 --> 3853.66
physical object at least weird stories

3849.1 --> 3856.36
but so he is basically entertaining that

3853.66 --> 3858.22
global or still within his truth-telling

3856.36 --> 3862.36
and I think he really does believe that

3858.22 --> 3866.89
I don't think he's lying with his ideas

3862.36 --> 3870.0
and then do controllers you could say

3866.89 --> 3873.37
kind of like that because despite he

3870.0 --> 3877.36
encouraging truth is also alongside with

3873.37 --> 3880.27
that truth bringing globe views that

3877.36 --> 3886.2400000000002
people will then associate with his open

3880.27 --> 3889.12
honesty and that is why he was given

3886.24 --> 3891.6899999999996
basically the bigger stage or something

3889.12 --> 3895.99
I don't I'm not saying he got it I say

3891.69 --> 3901.54
he lived to get that big stage wasn't

3895.99 --> 3904.5099999999998
like rammed completely out he was yeah

3901.54 --> 3908.2
silence the he was like he has had his

3904.51 --> 3913.8
issues but he's managed to grow pretty

3908.2 --> 3913.7999999999997
big despite all of that so

3915.05 --> 3920.76
you know I think that the controllers

3917.7 --> 3923.49
always like it if somebody has a big

3920.76 --> 3926.8500000000004
story to tell and scan it wants to bring

3923.49 --> 3929.8199999999997
that story to a wider audience then they

3926.85 --> 3933.33
want them to have one that they want to

3929.82 --> 3936.06
have elite want them to have mistakes

3933.33 --> 3938.67
that they believe in that they could

3936.06 --> 3942.71
then later use for their own purposes to

3938.67 --> 3945.3
potentially manipulate them or

3942.71 --> 3948.54
mind-control them into thinking that

3945.3 --> 3950.9
they have to choose their side or people

3948.54 --> 3957.63
will attack them for their mistakes

3950.9 --> 3959.82
there could be all kinds of reasons but

3957.63 --> 3963.54
just because someone is out there is

3959.82 --> 3966.1200000000003
getting big is getting more audience

3963.54 --> 3971.43
less obstruction does not automatically

3966.12 --> 3973.2599999999998
mean that he was controlled opposition

3971.43 --> 3977.19
all the time he was that was the plan

3973.26 --> 3981.84
thirty years ago for him to do that it

3977.19 --> 3983.76
was paid really he think that really you

3981.84 --> 3989.33
know the level [ __ ] that guy had to go

3983.76 --> 3989.3300000000004
through it's just crazy

3990.63 --> 3996.089
who would do that it's controlled

3993.839 --> 3997.14
opposition that does that just doesn't

3996.089 --> 3999.65
make any sense to me

3997.14 --> 3999.65
really

4003.06 --> 4006.15
[Music]

4010.3 --> 4017.8900000000003
now but more colored doesn't need start

4014.17 --> 4021.9
yet they do because NASA is failing

4017.89 --> 4025.5899999999997
don't you get it because NASA is failing

4021.9 --> 4029.71
people will be looking for other sources

4025.59 --> 4031.42
so they need to be there because if

4029.71 --> 4033.52
there's nothing left people will

4031.42 --> 4037.05
literally start to become Restless and

4033.52 --> 4037.05
potentially revolt

4044.23 --> 4050.05
well Cleary I think that david icke in

4046.63 --> 4055.15
many ways is right i just think that he

4050.05 --> 4060.46
might be mixing up details because hey

4055.15 --> 4062.53
the guy of admittedly so has had vision

4060.46 --> 4066.01
experiences which reminded me a lot of

4062.53 --> 4070.05
things how i when he told about it was

4066.01 --> 4075.4300000000003
very honest and it reminds me a lot of

4070.05 --> 4077.7400000000002
how I experience things so hey I shared

4075.43 --> 4081.4199999999996
out in the open look with a lot of the

4077.74 --> 4085.1499999999996
vision also came like tricks and

4081.42 --> 4088.9300000000003
misinterpretations from my side well who

4085.15 --> 4091.57
says he got it all perfect you know who

4088.93 --> 4095.1299999999997
says anyone can get that all perfect I

4091.57 --> 4098.83
don't even know if that is doable

4095.13 --> 4104.339
probably not everybody's going to make

4098.83 --> 4104.339
mistakes in their views

4108.709 --> 4114.079
yeah the studio and you're saying

4111.139 --> 4119.1990000000005
exactly it's just why do you do that

4114.079 --> 4121.6089999999995
I just know hot like it five ten-minute

4119.199 --> 4126.589
explanation about why do you just say

4121.609 --> 4129.88
that how do you know it's lies how do

4126.589 --> 4129.88
you know he doesn't believe that

4145.739 --> 4148.739
yeah

4152.009 --> 4158.58
well good servant it's tough you know

4155.39 --> 4164.58
it's a complicated question you could

4158.58 --> 4166.71
say look I hopped on for realsies thanks

4164.58 --> 4168.87
to Mark sardian at the time but

4166.71 --> 4170.759
technically I had been woken up to Flat

4168.87 --> 4175.44
Earth many times before that and it

4170.759 --> 4179.4
probably started with my own parents but

4175.44 --> 4182.969999999999
it just it didn't stick it didn't switch

4179.4 --> 4187.739
it didn't replace the globe that had

4182.97 --> 4191.31
already kind of not in it's in not its

4187.739 --> 4193.23
entire side but elements of it halves

4191.31 --> 4197.06
had slipped in already so I kind of

4193.23 --> 4201.0599999999995
rejected I wanted to see it all and

4197.06 --> 4205.14
eventually that just dragged me in until

4201.06 --> 4207.84
I just completely rejected anything

4205.14 --> 4212.9400000000005
other than science and the globe that's

4207.84 --> 4216.29
kind of what does happen when you get

4212.94 --> 4216.29
dragged into that

4226.219 --> 4232.19
all right well I guess that one of the

4230.18 --> 4234.650000000001
more important things that really woke

4232.19 --> 4236.78
me up was just some certain types of

4234.65 --> 4240.25
footage that I'd never seen before or

4236.78 --> 4246.94
why I had seen it before my visions I

4240.25 --> 4246.94
mentioned that but but the bigger ones

4248.35 --> 4253.79
was a video where there was basically I

4251.78 --> 4256.63
don't know made that I don't remember

4253.79 --> 4261.29
and was it Robert asana or something

4256.63 --> 4263.63
where somebody drove very long distance

4261.29 --> 4267.59
had the camera on and it sped through it

4263.63 --> 4269.84
and you just you just see that that is

4267.59 --> 4272.6900000000005
freaking flat and that the horizon is

4269.84 --> 4275.87
not an edge of a sphere it just so

4272.69 --> 4278.599999999999
apparent so clear and the other one was

4275.87 --> 4280.94
footage really high altitude where the

4278.6 --> 4282.969
apparent Sun seemed very close and you

4280.94 --> 4289.36
had that weird spotlight effect that

4282.969 --> 4293.36
that absolutely like bumped the entire

4289.36 --> 4299.29
heliocentric potential just aside it

4293.36 --> 4302.66
just made me show like no good like like

4299.29 --> 4304.67
what I thought that was it is not and

4302.66 --> 4308.21
there is a new mystery because I really

4304.67 --> 4314.26
wanted to know what is that what is the

4308.21 --> 4314.26
Sun how can that be

4329.05 --> 4335.34
oh yeah and of course a very important

4331.39 --> 4339.64
thing added on with the with the quick

4335.34 --> 4342.46
driving stream is that being accompanied

4339.64 --> 4350.92
be with that saying of course where's

4342.46 --> 4353.13
the curvature where I love that we said

4350.92 --> 4353.13
that

4360.19 --> 4370.169999999999
all right Missouri bear that is correct

4362.29 --> 4374.83
oh by the way big bear made a boo-boo

4370.17 --> 4378.28
although he might now say screw that I'm

4374.83 --> 4381.1
gonna attack that all so this is but

4378.28 --> 4383.32
yeah I saw his last stream yesterday and

4381.1 --> 4387.09
he went all out against science

4383.32 --> 4392.71
scientific method is [ __ ] like what

4387.09 --> 4395.17
are you serious scientific method cannot

4392.71 --> 4399.34
prove the scientific method that he he

4395.17 --> 4402.1
didn't actually share the the real

4399.34 --> 4403.6900000000005
content of the scientific method it gave

4402.1 --> 4405.52
some background detail he was just

4403.69 --> 4408.099999999999
saying like no science is all wrong but

4405.52 --> 4409.84
he falsely equivocated it with the

4408.1 --> 4413.77
scientific method which is not wrong

4409.84 --> 4414.67
it's just not being applied so he made a

4413.77 --> 4419.4400000000005
big boo-boo

4414.67 --> 4422.28
concerning science yeah you did Owen you

4419.44 --> 4426.3099999999995
got it wrong that's okay

4422.28 --> 4428.86
it's annoying and especially people that

4426.31 --> 4434.080000000001
constantly claim science is super

4428.86 --> 4436.21
annoying but they got it wrong it's not

4434.08 --> 4438.7
science it's pseudoscience what they do

4436.21 --> 4440.44
is specifically because they're not

4438.7 --> 4445.389999999999
applying the scientific method they are

4440.44 --> 4447.629999999999
not actually proving effects through the

4445.39 --> 4450.09
observation of phenomena and then

4447.63 --> 4452.650000000001
physically changing the parameters

4450.09 --> 4455.41
interacting with the phenomena in order

4452.65 --> 4459.009999999999
to establish the cause of the effect

4455.41 --> 4462.58
I heard none of that and you don't hear

4459.01 --> 4467.47
that from supposed scientists that get

4462.58 --> 4469.75
their was e childlike approach like yo

4467.47 --> 4472.0
you could do anything with it but when

4469.75 --> 4474.82
we say it then science doesn't prove

4472.0 --> 4478.0
anything that is all pseudoscience

4474.82 --> 4481.45
nonsense it is a complete step away from

4478.0 --> 4487.24
what science really was so Big Bear I

4481.45 --> 4489.329
hope you take that to heart or or not

4487.24 --> 4493.228999999999
it's up to you

4489.329 --> 4496.709
still love your streams though oh and I

4493.229 --> 4500.599
have finally found that channel that he

4496.709 --> 4503.489
constantly keeps on sharing stuff with

4500.599 --> 4507.019
what's his station Ellison stationery

4503.489 --> 4509.339
wall giri's I thought it was wool bears

4507.019 --> 4510.869000000001
because it sounded like bears but it

4509.339 --> 4514.409
wasn't that at all so I subscribe to

4510.869 --> 4517.919
that channel he has some hilarious music

4514.409 --> 4523.648999999999
like on the edge music videos that he

4517.919 --> 4526.999
makes it's just fantastic I'm gonna try

4523.649 --> 4526.999000000001
to find the other ones as well

4541.39 --> 4544.08
it's

4548.499 --> 4558.489
oh my god Howard morgue dumbass how many

4556.78 --> 4561.039
times are you gonna regurgitate that

4558.489 --> 4562.928999999999
nonsense it's the same nonsense over and

4561.039 --> 4568.139
over again you sound just like Brenda

4562.929 --> 4571.749
Doody greedy improve speech you create

4568.139 --> 4573.969
near in space space with capital letters

4571.749 --> 4577.65
makes it real and must be really big

4573.969 --> 4577.65
because I wrote it with capital letters

4590.27 --> 4593.409000000001
[Music]

4598.19 --> 4603.349999999999
right I'll be back I'm gonna keep on

4600.72 --> 4603.35
streaming but

4718.889 --> 4723.900000000001
so are you guys talking about now

4763.44 --> 4769.95
oh right well when people especially

4767.46 --> 4771.66
like our more just say ban me that's

4769.95 --> 4774.179999999999
really a sign that they're running out

4771.66 --> 4776.75
of argument so they are hoping for an

4774.18 --> 4778.29
honorable discharge by being banned

4776.75 --> 4785.01
don't do that

4778.29 --> 4788.75
it's not necessary you can come back and

4785.01 --> 4788.75
try again another time if he likes

4823.92 --> 4833.63
Yeah right yeah IPS is something else

4828.36 --> 4837.42
that that that was the name of a channel

4833.63 --> 4840.68
who supposedly stood for that yet never

4837.42 --> 4840.68
ever talked about it

4852.92 --> 4864.7300000000005
I could I could screw with your mind and

4859.43 --> 4864.7300000000005
say IPS stands for infinite plano sphere

4866.56 --> 4870.04
sorry couldn't help

4876.44 --> 4879.61
[Music]

4882.32 --> 4894.86
yeah I know it's a mind screw hmm it's

4891.449 --> 4894.86
definitely not gonna work out

4923.639 --> 4930.36
all right okay Howard more but have you

4926.76 --> 4933.389
actually followed up on their research

4930.36 --> 4938.3099999999995
or did you just read a lot of statements

4933.389 --> 4941.31
and a lot of data that was supposed to

4938.31 --> 4944.85
the one that made it supposed to prove

4941.31 --> 4947.400000000001
it given with some logical reason but

4944.85 --> 4949.679
did you actually follow up on any of it

4947.4 --> 4952.619
to check out if it if it actually is

4949.679 --> 4955.32
true if any of it makes sense if there

4952.619 --> 4958.65
is anything for you to test whether it

4955.32 --> 4969.049999999999
is true or not have you ever followed up

4958.65 --> 4969.049999999999
on all that Howard more lo Nathan

4977.539 --> 4984.099
this is I hope not best duster your 68 I

4981.409 --> 4984.098999999999
certainly hope not

4986.71 --> 4997.719
really you did lab research and that

4992.989 --> 4997.718999999999
proved to you that the earth was a ball

4998.019 --> 5007.6900000000005
fascinating wow man

5005.139 --> 5010.09
well by that standard who needs to go

5007.69 --> 5011.768999999999
out and test anything out there if you

5010.09 --> 5018.179
can just prove the earth it's a sphere

5011.769 --> 5018.179
in a lab that's amazing

5028.04 --> 5034.359
[Music]

5052.819 --> 5058.639
yeah maybe I need to start a GoFundMe

5055.369 --> 5064.0689999999995
for a laboratory so I can prove the

5058.639 --> 5066.939
earth is whatever it's actually kind of

5064.069 --> 5066.939
interesting ideas

5074.269 --> 5077.269
biology

5078.019 --> 5085.610000000001
what how Oh

5081.92 --> 5089.349
does my ology prove the earth is a

5085.61 --> 5092.03
sphere more dye you really got it

5089.349 --> 5095.6900000000005
you really got to explain that I want to

5092.03 --> 5098.03
be it's okay the physics in chemistry

5095.69 --> 5107.989
okay there's something you can do with

5098.03 --> 5111.289
that but biology what understanding

5107.989 --> 5113.03
reality what your spherical reality how

5111.289 --> 5116.469
gas pressures supposed to stick to a

5113.03 --> 5119.63
ball in the giant outer space vacuum

5116.469 --> 5126.05
this impossible gradient that can never

5119.63 --> 5130.789
be copied in those divisions in any kind

5126.05 --> 5133.4890000000005
of setup small or big how does biology

5130.789 --> 5136.699
clear you up to the reality that the

5133.489 --> 5138.499
earth is all that I don't think it does

5136.699 --> 5141.23
that at all I don't think that if there

5138.499 --> 5144.349
is any kind of possibility of

5141.23 --> 5148.098999999999
instability of the of the gases on this

5144.349 --> 5156.019
world versus more room out there I don't

5148.099 --> 5161.05
think any life could adapt or thrive for

5156.019 --> 5164.51
so long if there was not just a solid

5161.05 --> 5168.139
permanent container containing the gases

5164.51 --> 5171.409000000001
guaranteeing a relatively stable stable

5168.139 --> 5173.4800000000005
pressure within the realm and with that

5171.409 --> 5175.96
stable temperatures as well thanks to

5173.48 --> 5175.959999999999
the Sun

5177.42 --> 5186.6900000000005
Oh physics I'm now addressing physics I

5183.03 --> 5188.34
was puzzled as to how biology reveals

5186.69 --> 5190.74
any of that because if you look into

5188.34 --> 5192.63
what makes biology biology what makes it

5190.74 --> 5195.179999999999
function what's best for it

5192.63 --> 5198.51
yes stability stability and pressure

5195.18 --> 5202.860000000001
stability temperature well how does that

5198.51 --> 5205.68
work on your ball doesn't make any

5202.86 --> 5208.23
freaking sense just anything could just

5205.68 --> 5216.29
pass by just Ram into the earth it's all

5208.23 --> 5219.57
gone I was how is anything gonna

5216.29 --> 5221.82
supposedly evolve back to a full world

5219.57 --> 5224.82
with the widespread variety of creatures

5221.82 --> 5229.44
from that when evolution cannot even

5224.82 --> 5232.0199999999995
remotely be proved and even remotely all

5229.44 --> 5234.679999999999
of the supposed backings for it all of

5232.02 --> 5237.4800000000005
it in every direction dinosaurs or

5234.68 --> 5242.75
actual supposed proof for evolution or

5237.48 --> 5245.91
evolution of micro species all of it

5242.75 --> 5249.2
you know this proves it and there's

5245.91 --> 5252.51
giant fraud going on there as well

5249.2 --> 5254.49
especially in the old days so there is a

5252.51 --> 5257.49
proof of evolution so how could in a

5254.49 --> 5259.26
super potential unstable environment

5257.49 --> 5261.69
where anything 2 X outside could just

5259.26 --> 5267.17
hit in and disrupt the entire thing on a

5261.69 --> 5271.099999999999
regular basis potentially how could life

5267.17 --> 5274.92
thrive with such a variety in there

5271.1 --> 5277.280000000001
without evolution why is there anything

5274.92 --> 5277.28
left

5279.3 --> 5284.68
doesn't make any sense but yeah then

5281.68 --> 5286.72
again doesn't really match up for the

5284.68 --> 5288.97
ball fantasy if you don't assume

5286.72 --> 5291.9400000000005
evolution can happen and that anything

5288.97 --> 5299.56
can all spring from something simple

5291.94 --> 5302.95
just by by itself over time but just

5299.56 --> 5305.860000000001
never been proven I guess you have to

5302.95 --> 5309.72
keep that suspense of disbelief in there

5305.86 --> 5309.719999999999
in order for that to make it work out

5310.08 --> 5314.79
special pleading that's correct more

5312.4 --> 5314.79
colored

5325.33 --> 5333.03
yeah good isn't it you think it's good

5329.14 --> 5336.280000000001
you think your arguments are still good

5333.03 --> 5337.66
because we do talk about the physics

5336.28 --> 5342.219999999999
talk about a second law of

5337.66 --> 5344.58
thermodynamics for example gradients gas

5342.22 --> 5347.89
pressure gradients we go into physics

5344.58 --> 5350.92
widely and we actually address every

5347.89 --> 5352.660000000001
part of it and figure out if there's a

5350.92 --> 5359.05
scientific method that is actually

5352.66 --> 5361.09
involved in it and so yeah I don't know

5359.05 --> 5365.29
I would be feeling kind of dumb at this

5361.09 --> 5366.88
point if I would still champion the

5365.29 --> 5369.87
globe and everything that comes with it

5366.88 --> 5369.87
after all this

5372.34 --> 5381.309
what that is the dumbest thing I've ever

5377.619 --> 5384.5199999999995
heard how it more really you have to get

5381.309 --> 5387.039
in in a lab with a real professor and

5384.52 --> 5389.650000000001
you'll see what you mean that the real

5387.039 --> 5392.739
professor with his lat coat will

5389.65 --> 5394.96
indoctrinate you and look very smart at

5392.739 --> 5397.48
you with his glasses and whatever and

5394.96 --> 5399.4890000000005
then when you say but isn't there a

5397.48 --> 5402.549999999999
problem here and he said oh no of course

5399.489 --> 5406.119
not we figured this out and then then

5402.55 --> 5408.1900000000005
I'll see really when he talks really

5406.119 --> 5409.509999999999
complicated in this explanations and you

5408.19 --> 5410.949
don't really get it but you're too

5409.51 --> 5412.719
embarrassed to admit it so you're just

5410.949 --> 5414.489
gonna say okay yeah that makes sense I

5412.719 --> 5420.15
get you I believe you know is that what

5414.489 --> 5420.15
you're gonna do [ __ ] sake man

5425.119 --> 5428.74
just

5427.219 --> 5432.359
can't be serious

5428.74 --> 5432.3589999999995
[Music]

5439.61 --> 5445.0599999999995
[Music]

5447.49 --> 5450.889999999999
[Music]

5470.57 --> 5478.65
HM I'm pretty sure if Venus has no size

5475.04 --> 5481.7699999999995
it just has an assumed size and then it

5478.65 --> 5484.32
is assumed that that assumed size is the

5481.77 --> 5487.740000000001
same size as the assumed size of the

5484.32 --> 5491.48
assumed ball earth that is what that is

5487.74 --> 5491.48
it's a lot of assumptions

5505.109 --> 5512.339
or Howard Moore at an education stands

5508.26 --> 5514.979
and false by the strength of its bonds

5512.339 --> 5519.929
and its content and the legitimacy and

5514.979 --> 5522.269
testability of it so yeah education is

5519.929 --> 5525.149
great but it really depends on what is

5522.269 --> 5529.159000000001
being taught and the methods that are

5525.149 --> 5532.7390000000005
being given to those ones being taught

5529.159 --> 5534.929
in how to process information and figure

5532.739 --> 5536.759999999999
out reality and if that is not really

5534.929 --> 5539.55
part of it they're just being railroaded

5536.76 --> 5542.6990000000005
yeah and then the education sucks it'll

5539.55 --> 5544.559
just create mind-control slaves for a

5542.699 --> 5546.268999999999
certain type of direction for a certain

5544.559 --> 5548.070000000001
type of thinking just like what happened

5546.269 --> 5551.879
with the whole freaking social justice

5548.07 --> 5553.438999999999
warrior nonsense that is also a type of

5551.879 --> 5556.019
education you think that's a good

5553.439 --> 5559.889
education Howard Moore you think that's

5556.019 --> 5562.219
good for these people and society huh I

5559.889 --> 5566.339
think that's a good education no

5562.219 --> 5569.129
education stands and false with the

5566.339 --> 5570.989
value and weight and legitimacy of its

5569.129 --> 5575.849
content and what it will actually

5570.989 --> 5578.119
provide for those being taught is it

5575.849 --> 5582.57
gonna railroad them into a certain

5578.119 --> 5584.098999999999
approach and belief system or is it

5582.57 --> 5586.889
going to give them a wider perspective

5584.099 --> 5589.289
and actual doable tools that they can

5586.889 --> 5594.179
use for themselves independently to

5589.289 --> 5596.699
figure out how things work value of an

5594.179 --> 5599.3
education stands and Falls with its

5596.699 --> 5599.299999999999
content

5610.26 --> 5618.900000000001
hmm did I just see cool I just got an

5616.65 --> 5622.19
update from YouTube that Nathan's going

5618.9 --> 5628.44
live that's awesome

5622.19 --> 5632.04
it was going live yesterday no no no

5628.44 --> 5634.29
it's not a replay no it literally just

5632.04 --> 5640.739
popped up in the corner it's going live

5634.29 --> 5644.61
from yesterday because there's nothing

5640.739 --> 5649.41
live now not no there is no replay there

5644.61 --> 5653.28
is nothing happening right now it was a

5649.41 --> 5658.92
thing from yesterday there's nothing

5653.28 --> 5660.95
live right now all right

5658.92 --> 5660.95
Oh

5662.03 --> 5669.53
okay apparently there is had to refresh

5667.52 --> 5675.320000000001
my screen it's just great

5669.53 --> 5679.21
ah okay yeah it's an older one whatever

5675.32 --> 5679.21
I'm gonna keep on going

5682.48 --> 5685.78
[Music]

5685.79 --> 5692.59
I thought it was another typical super

5688.46 --> 5692.59
delayed pop-up I've had some of those

5697.18 --> 5703.88
yeah the weird thing it popped up then I

5700.19 --> 5705.29
went to my YouTube page looked in yeah

5703.88 --> 5708.32
on the Bell you know at the

5705.29 --> 5710.69
notifications and it wasn't there so I

5708.32 --> 5712.3099999999995
thought oh not again but then I

5710.69 --> 5715.509999999999
refreshed the page and then it actually

5712.31 --> 5715.51
did show it so

5726.98 --> 5734.349999999999
all Nathan that just did get in chat a

5730.07 --> 5734.349999999999
little bit earlier so he is here

5754.21 --> 5763.64
what what okay

5761.02 --> 5767.780000000001
so count can you tell me what a Dutch

5763.64 --> 5775.31
pirate looks like do I really look like

5767.78 --> 5781.04
that the [ __ ] well silly enough I am

5775.31 --> 5783.26
kind of like if I'd had to if I would be

5781.04 --> 5785.96
forced to choose a political party it

5783.26 --> 5789.9800000000005
would be the pirate party so that's kind

5785.96 --> 5791.62
of funny that you mentioned that but do

5789.98 --> 5802.969999999999
I look like a virus

5791.62 --> 5809.84
what darn it you're crazy crazy

5802.97 --> 5813.9400000000005
landlubbers I'm actually kind of curious

5809.84 --> 5813.9400000000005
as to what the done

5882.179 --> 5888.1990000000005
I went on mute how did that happen

5898.28 --> 5908.24
okay how long if I'm in a mute I have no

5900.95 --> 5914.78
idea I so you did get the whole Dutch

5908.24 --> 5917.12
pirate part right I think you did so I

5914.78 --> 5919.219999999999
actually looked up like okay if I'm

5917.12 --> 5921.5
supposedly looking like a Dutch pirate

5919.22 --> 5923.33
what what that looked like so I grew of

5921.5 --> 5926.17
it and then I found this really

5923.33 --> 5928.97
interesting historical site about the

5926.17 --> 5933.64
privateers about historical Breck round

5928.97 --> 5940.58
as two dutch pirates privateers it's

5933.64 --> 5944.030000000001
funny I'll post the link in chat and it

5940.58 --> 5947.5
has some interesting photographs so

5944.03 --> 5947.5
let's see if I can get some of that

5948.61 --> 5958.219999999999
right well yeah just amazing paintings

5954.8 --> 5961.46
from the time don't look particularly

5958.22 --> 5964.91
like any of them though yeah you'll

5961.46 --> 5970.51
probably find some of these over at

5964.91 --> 5970.51
Morton lead cos as well that's not

5972.88 --> 5983.54
Francis Drake okay this was a pirate guy

5976.1 --> 5988.75
or a privateer I guess maybe no but they

5983.54 --> 5992.53
do wear black a lot you're another one

5988.75 --> 5992.53
also kind of wears black

5994.469 --> 6003.68
I don't think pirates had long hair

5999.69 --> 6009.73
though probably because yeah that was

6003.68 --> 6009.7300000000005
not the thing to do at the time

6012.26 --> 6025.5
Mayson rope really Queen is a Dutch

6019.62 --> 6029.099999999999
pirate okay alright anyway I just

6025.5 --> 6036.09
thought okay maybe I would I don't get

6029.1 --> 6037.71
why he would call me that yeah so yeah

6036.09 --> 6039.63
you can take a look for yourself there's

6037.71 --> 6042.38
some interesting history background

6039.63 --> 6042.38
stuff in there

6054.409 --> 6058.388999999999
oh god more color

6060.02 --> 6063.1990000000005
[Music]

[Music]

6072.58 --> 6080.29
yes the studio sort of I don't know

6120.519 --> 6126.159000000001
how the quit flat-plane organ while that

6123.909 --> 6129.9
picture of blood suppose at queen I

6126.159 --> 6129.9
think that was the Queen of England

6131.88 --> 6140.159000000001
like the fame of Queen Elizabeth I

6135.15 --> 6144.518999999999
recognized that anywhere she had like

6140.159 --> 6148.36
yeah very weird unique it was absolutely

6144.519 --> 6154.809
like wizardry in a way what she did with

6148.36 --> 6159.07
her clothes but I recognized that style

6154.809 --> 6162.579000000001
anytime my ex was also very infatuated

6159.07 --> 6165.389
with it made some dress dresses inspired

6162.579 --> 6165.389
on that

6170.73 --> 6186.7
thanks the eye thanks that's what I want

6176.23 --> 6190.87
I don't know maybe I could play one in a

6186.7 --> 6196.15
movie or something goody they'd love to

6190.87 --> 6202.5
cast me as a as an evil guy a bet or as

6196.15 --> 6205.78
something weak this man I've been been

6202.5 --> 6208.93
sampling some things some clips and some

6205.78 --> 6210.54
reviews of that Joker movie you what the

6208.93 --> 6215.17
[ __ ] man

6210.54 --> 6220.5
that movie is messed up and that guy

6215.17 --> 6220.5
freaks me out like really bad

6228.34 --> 6239.53
the French that's a good well I haven't

6236.65 --> 6245.41
watched it completely but just the guy

6239.53 --> 6248.13

6245.41 --> 6252.0
on with serious mental illness and

6248.13 --> 6257.77
illusions and [ __ ] supposedly cheese

6252.0 --> 6259.75
it's just so messed up I guess I'm gonna

6257.77 --> 6262.330000000001
have to watch it but I think I'm gonna

6259.75 --> 6265.29
watch it when I feel a lot stronger

6262.33 --> 6268.69
because that movie is just messed up I

6265.29 --> 6271.36
think maybe it's not that bad in

6268.69 --> 6279.28
retrospect maybe it's just really

6271.36 --> 6281.92
special Benjamin film Jesus head um can

I have no idea what you're talking about

6506.36 --> 6513.37

6508.66 --> 6513.37
is that some documentary somewhere

6525.42 --> 6531.31
hmm

6527.64 --> 6535.110000000001
where can I find that that's something I

6531.31 --> 6535.110000000001
can find on Netflix or YouTube

6542.409 --> 6550.2699999999995
if you could link me up I'd appreciate

6544.42 --> 6554.92

shoot anyway if you could put a link to

6564.25 --> 6569.699
it in the chat you should now be able to

6567.28 --> 6569.699
do that

6588.07 --> 6591.07
anyway

6611.52 --> 6615.39
see if there's anything else

6625.6 --> 6628.93
that's it Oh

6633.17 --> 6637.93
Hey Ares 1:06 doing good

6643.76 --> 6656.4490000000005
mmm Coffee time not for me I've had

6653.489 --> 6656.449
plenty of coffee

6657.829 --> 6665.759999999999
all right well Risa 106 I am in a good

6661.53 --> 6668.148999999999
mood I guess I've been enjoying the now

6665.76 --> 6673.05
much clearer a brighter Sun out there

6668.149 --> 6675.059
the whole morning and that always for

6673.05 --> 6677.359
some reason puts me in a much better

6675.059 --> 6677.359
mood

6681.96 --> 6684.9800000000005
look at that

6690.01 --> 6693.18
pretty sweet right

6708.31 --> 6712.929
[Music]

6709.929 --> 6712.929
right

6716.81 --> 6722.01
yeah clear skies and and nice and sunny

6720.09 --> 6723.42
and it's still kind of cold though I

6722.01 --> 6726.09
have my heater on

6723.42 --> 6728.07
but yeah I'm I don't have shoes on and

6726.09 --> 6730.53
they're still getting kind of cold so I

6728.07 --> 6734.91
think it is really fresh man if this

6730.53 --> 6737.489
persists then probably this night it's

6734.91 --> 6740.639999999999
gonna freeze very hard I think because

6737.489 --> 6742.679999999999
it just looks like if this keeps us up

6740.64 --> 6745.47
it's gonna be extremely cold and maybe

6742.68 --> 6748.68
super clear sky as well so I might see

6745.47 --> 6750.93
some stars who knows maybe tonight is

6748.68 --> 6755.1
going to be very beautiful I might get

6750.93 --> 6757.59
my camera out my p900 out again and see

6755.1 --> 6765.650000000001
if I can get some star footage try that

6757.59 --> 6765.650000000001
out who knows

6769.369 --> 6779.799999999999
yeah I heard that Karen B they're trying

6774.17 --> 6779.8
to yeah it's a big problem

6796.79 --> 6802.55
that there while they're trying to hurt

6799.4 --> 6805.339999999999
it I get the feeling that they're

6802.55 --> 6809.08
literally trying to turn YouTube into

6805.34 --> 6812.21
like a rough comparison like into a

6809.08 --> 6814.67
communist city type setup like what

6812.21 --> 6816.89
they've done with Chicago New York that

6814.67 --> 6819.43
just everybody's in there and they're

6816.89 --> 6822.7300000000005
literally just tightening the grips and

6819.43 --> 6830.4800000000005
trying to turn it into like a online

6822.73 --> 6832.91
communist state maybe that where you

6830.48 --> 6836.089999999999
have to do it like they want it and

6832.91 --> 6838.49
they're literally just like yeah I don't

6836.09 --> 6840.9800000000005
know what's gonna happen if it keeps up

6838.49 --> 6842.63
and they don't think I'm good enough or

6840.98 --> 6846.32
I'm not supposed to say the things that

6842.63 --> 6848.150000000001
I do that's just gonna be over and I

6846.32 --> 6850.16
don't like the idea because I've been

6848.15 --> 6855.009999999999
doing pretty good on YouTube or well

6850.16 --> 6860.96
good enough for me to keep on going but

6855.01 --> 6865.1
yeah if I have to drop my absolute

6860.96 --> 6868.4
honesty then there's lose very little

6865.1 --> 6871.0
point in me staying hanging around very

6868.4 --> 6871.0
little point

6892.79 --> 6897.7699999999995
I don't know the studio 68 I think the

6895.97 --> 6900.02
social credit system is already there

6897.77 --> 6907.55
it's being applied within corporations

6900.02 --> 6911.9800000000005
as policy it is there but to make that

6907.55 --> 6911.9800000000005
in an official state run the rule system

6915.34 --> 6920.89
that would be so incredibly a saying

6918.26 --> 6925.1
that would literally loud in the

6920.89 --> 6929.410000000001
absolute one weight collapse of the

6925.1 --> 6931.7300000000005
entire Western society it's all gonna be

6929.41 --> 6938.05
completely destroyed

6931.73 --> 6939.259999999999
everybody's gonna fade it's just no more

6938.05 --> 6942.53
purpose

6939.26 --> 6946.81
everybody's literally just gonna fade

6942.53 --> 6952.73
away if they do that it's all gonna die

6946.81 --> 6956.21
entire western society so yeah wish the

6952.73 --> 6959.03
best of luck to anyone thinks it's worth

6956.21 --> 6961.55
promoting that [ __ ] to get your little

6959.03 --> 6964.33
bit better paying job it's up to you

6961.55 --> 6967.28
because you're gonna be responsible for

6964.33 --> 6971.09
literally the entire flourishing of

6967.28 --> 6974.05
people's in the Western world to fade

6971.09 --> 6978.5
away into obscurity death and

6974.05 --> 6981.820000000001
hopelessness and everything being fake

6978.5 --> 6988.42
nobody ever daring to show any kind of

6981.82 --> 6991.3099999999995
genuine feeling or opinion ever again

6988.42 --> 6995.09
you look forward to that you look

6991.31 --> 6998.660000000001
forward on to a permanently reinforced

6995.09 --> 7003.34
lie that you can never escape from that

6998.66 --> 7005.0199999999995
even if you in some kind of bad mood you

7003.34 --> 7009.43
throw it out there and you might

7005.02 --> 7011.080000000001
actually just end up being forced to

7009.43 --> 7012.79
freaking end your own life because

7011.08 --> 7015.37
there's nowhere left to go because you

7012.79 --> 7017.26
said the wrong thing and now everything

7015.37 --> 7022.26
is falling apart and everybody goes away

7017.26 --> 7025.18
from you in hyper fear it would be worse

7022.26 --> 7026.579000000001
than being a brutal criminal in this

7025.18 --> 7031.2390000000005
time

7026.579 --> 7033.46
much worse so I wish you the best of

7031.239 --> 7035.799999999999
luck with your credit social credit

7033.46 --> 7039.61
score if you absolutely want to

7035.8 --> 7041.860000000001
permanently wreck the entire fabric of

7039.61 --> 7044.23
Western society anything that was still

7041.86 --> 7046.21
kind of valuable about it despite all

7044.23 --> 7048.968999999999
the delusions and the failures and

7046.21 --> 7052.599
weaknesses if you want anything left of

7048.969 --> 7059.139
that you're gonna have to stop this

7052.599 --> 7061.26
pretty much no matter what just so you

7059.139 --> 7061.26
know

7066.48 --> 7073.089999999999
yeah well Karen B that's fine or you

7069.07 --> 7075.73
just don't give a [ __ ] but yeah what if

7073.09 --> 7077.17
that means that someday suddenly you

7075.73 --> 7079.058999999999
won't be able to get out of the country

7077.17 --> 7081.369
because you can you're not allowed in

7079.059 --> 7084.7300000000005
airports anymore how about that can be I

7081.369 --> 7088.179
would you like to go to Europe and you

7084.73 --> 7091.629999999999
can't or maybe you won't even be allowed

7088.179 --> 7093.67
to cross the state border maybe they'll

7091.63 --> 7095.559
put of that maybe they'll get it so far

7093.67 --> 7099.639
that you'll literally not even be

7095.559 --> 7103.869000000001
allowed to to move outside of the county

7099.639 --> 7106.78
border yeah you think you think they'll

7103.869 --> 7109.808999999999
have a limit to how much pressure they

7106.78 --> 7112.96
will utilize with that you don't see it

7109.809 --> 7115.03
happening no but that's the thing you

7112.96 --> 7117.639
don't see it happening until it's there

7115.03 --> 7119.969
and then there's no more escape from it

7117.639 --> 7122.5
because suddenly nothing works anymore

7119.969 --> 7124.269
yeah freedom you can ignore it and then

7122.5 --> 7126.61
sadly you can't do anything more because

7124.269 --> 7132.51
you're literally being halted by people

7126.61 --> 7132.509999999999
with guns how about that Karen B

7134.14 --> 7140.08
yeah that's what I said there will be

7136.18 --> 7142.780000000001
huge revolt if that probably it would

7140.08 --> 7146.13
have to be or it will be literally the

7142.78 --> 7151.29
silent death of Western society

7146.13 --> 7156.31
it won't happen oh you mean just like

7151.29 --> 7159.28
like climate change based credit system

7156.31 --> 7161.85
would not be introduced and enforced

7159.28 --> 7165.36
within the taxes just like that thing

7161.85 --> 7170.650000000001
it's already there yeah

7165.36 --> 7172.78
don't want what okay sure sure it won't

7170.65 --> 7174.94
it'll just be there I'll just be trivial

7172.78 --> 7176.53
until something happens and suddenly

7174.94 --> 7179.5
it's not trivial you anymore oh look

7176.53 --> 7181.24
they kept a record for decades it's not

7179.5 --> 7183.22
travel you anymore oh wait oh wait

7181.24 --> 7186.19
suddenly you're not allowed to do

7183.22 --> 7187.84
anything anymore I don't know where just

7186.19 --> 7191.82
because something happened that doesn't

7187.84 --> 7191.82
even relate to you how about that

7195.949 --> 7203.11
yet people do fought for that [ __ ] and

7198.14 --> 7207.410000000001
they allow deep deep communist

7203.11 --> 7210.049999999999
indoctrination to make them decide that

7207.41 --> 7213.5599999999995
it needs to die that free speech needs

7210.05 --> 7216.83
to die that people must be forced to

7213.56 --> 7219.410000000001
follow a certain route in life and that

7216.83 --> 7223.34
they don't get the option that the other

7219.41 --> 7224.989
option is death and isolation and people

7223.34 --> 7227.12
will go along with it they'll say yeah

7224.989 --> 7231.639999999999
yeah we're so sick of these stupid

7227.12 --> 7236.449
whatever trolls right-wingers krumpers

7231.64 --> 7240.83
whatever anything any reason they will

7236.449 --> 7242.2699999999995
go for it yeah and they'll all vote and

7240.83 --> 7244.13
they'll vote for it and you'll be

7242.27 --> 7246.77
standing there I'm not gonna vote and

7244.13 --> 7252.38
guess what it's there what are you gonna

7246.77 --> 7256.160000000001
do what are you gonna do are you going

7252.38 --> 7261.9800000000005
to do something before they all vote it

7256.16 --> 7265.0
in or are you going to try to do

7261.98 --> 7265.0
something after it

7266.6 --> 7269.77
it's up to you

7270.469 --> 7277.31
oh no really Karen B I think you

7273.94 --> 7280.04
severely underestimate what Americans

7277.31 --> 7282.320000000001
will put up with just compare current

7280.04 --> 7289.79
day situation with a hundred years ago

7282.32 --> 7291.86
and you know what I mean then no but the

7289.79 --> 7300.58
thing is Americans will put up with

7291.86 --> 7300.58
anything if they can ignore it anything

7309.419 --> 7314.61
yeah but people being aware of it

7311.999 --> 7317.239
doesn't actually create a driver

7314.61 --> 7320.88
necessarily they'll just still ignore it

7317.239 --> 7323.129999999999
they'll know why they ignore it they're

7320.88 --> 7326.099
still gonna ignore it they're not gonna

7323.13 --> 7329.01
do anything about it nobody ever does

7326.099 --> 7330.869000000001
that's what they think and when somebody

7329.01 --> 7332.939
does they either then start to believe

7330.869 --> 7335.82
it's control position it was always

7332.939 --> 7338.9890000000005
meant to be there or all that person is

7335.82 --> 7342.688999999999
after something nefarious in the end and

7338.989 --> 7345.959
then yeah it all happens because you

7342.689 --> 7348.530000000001
didn't do anything sorry I'm kind of

7345.959 --> 7348.53
pushing you

7355.79 --> 7375.4
boiling frogs indeed I I just don't get

7370.52 --> 7379.9400000000005
why there's not more regular people

7375.4 --> 7382.07
actually backed by police probably just

7379.94 --> 7384.589999999999
storming Parliament's and dragging

7382.07 --> 7386.44
people off to jail I don't get why

7384.59 --> 7389.83
that's not happening at this point

7386.44 --> 7394.94
should be happening on a regular basis

7389.83 --> 7397.91
it's very serious and I'm not saying ooh

7394.94 --> 7401.389999999999
terrorists don't don't attack no there

7397.91 --> 7405.25
should simply be grassroots organized

7401.39 --> 7410.3
efforts from people that know this is

7405.25 --> 7412.88
way way out of control these people are

7410.3 --> 7416.3
mentally insane delusional they're

7412.88 --> 7421.61
literally being guided by Satan it's so

7416.3 --> 7422.6
apparent that children will shriek you

7421.61 --> 7428.48
got to stop it

7422.6 --> 7431.3
you gotta force the law what they did

7428.48 --> 7436.25
and just say no more

7431.3 --> 7440.650000000001
and don't freaking wait for some guy on

7436.25 --> 7447.07
top to do it for you no you gotta do it

7440.65 --> 7447.07
you got to do it together

7453.14 --> 7456.319
[Music]

7463.71 --> 7466.94
it's the only way

7500.53 --> 7503.219999999999
right

7509.94 --> 7517.96
in a way you could consider it like this

7513.51 --> 7521.34
if a large people group has been so

7517.96 --> 7526.3
indoctrinated that they're literally in

7521.34 --> 7529.57
their insanity visibly walking to an

7526.3 --> 7534.01
abyss to absolute death for them in the

7529.57 --> 7539.38
end they're doing that you gotta stop

7534.01 --> 7541.030000000001
them you can't say no you know that's

7539.38 --> 7552.61
what they want that's what they believe

7541.03 --> 7557.44
that's ok no no gotta stop him and by

7552.61 --> 7560.86
the way no one should interpret anything

7557.44 --> 7565.66
I said or ever as some kind of

7560.86 --> 7567.7
encouragement to freaking antifa maniacs

7565.66 --> 7570.55
or [ __ ] or anti-trump

7567.7 --> 7572.29
obsessed freaks to take some kind of

7570.55 --> 7577.35
action because that's exactly the

7572.29 --> 7582.21
opposite they are the exact opposite of

7577.35 --> 7586.06
all that no they're there statist

7582.21 --> 7594.04
maniacs totally deluded weaponized

7586.06 --> 7597.81
maniacs should just shrivel up out of my

7594.04 --> 7602.62
face now I'm talking about real people

7597.81 --> 7605.410000000001
people that actually do want some kind

7602.62 --> 7609.94
of sensible world or nothing where where

7605.41 --> 7612.3099999999995
there is actual freedom that is what I'm

7609.94 --> 7619.0
talking about people with jobs with

7612.31 --> 7621.360000000001
families with farms with care actual

7619.0 --> 7621.36
care

7630.219 --> 7638.58
oh really AGM is that your prediction oh

7634.39 --> 7642.01
it's so original and it sounds so true

7638.58 --> 7644.3099999999995
that's just brilliant are you literally

7642.01 --> 7661.150000000001
reading what you're putting out there

7644.31 --> 7664.080000000001
that is really dumb piss me off

7661.15 --> 7664.08
sometimes dude

7674.01 --> 7680.12

7678.06 --> 7680.120000000001

7696.27 --> 7698.3
Oh

7757.71 --> 7769.07
person okay if I'd know anything else i

7762.6 --> 7774.33
ban you for that that's one of the worst

7769.07 --> 7777.54
laziest nihilistic defeatist approaches

7774.33 --> 7780.18
that you can have it's a terrible advice

7777.54 --> 7783.81
it's advice that I follow 20 years ago

7780.18 --> 7786.200000000001
guess what nothing happened to the world

7783.81 --> 7789.68
it's still there and I screwed myself

7786.2 --> 7794.16
because I was dumb enough to go for that

7789.68 --> 7797.400000000001
buddy yeah

7794.16 --> 7800.76
you can literally screw over your own

7797.4 --> 7802.95
freakin life by going with the belief

7800.76 --> 7804.4800000000005
that the world's gonna end anyway so

7802.95 --> 7810.29
you're not gonna plan anything you're

7804.48 --> 7810.29
not gonna do that that screws your life
