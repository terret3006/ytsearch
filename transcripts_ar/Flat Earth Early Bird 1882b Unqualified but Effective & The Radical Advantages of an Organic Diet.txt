artist then I'm literally a part of that

420.199 --> 425.72
scam because the reason that he does it

423.759 --> 429.44
is because of what I

425.72 --> 434.47900000000004
do do you understand that yeah he

465.479 --> 470.599
off

467.84 --> 472.79999999999995
okay did YouTube end the stream or did I

470.599 --> 476.87899999999996
end it by no I didn't end it by accident

472.8 --> 480.36
duper my internet connection got cut off

476.879 --> 483.12
and then OBS just ends the Stream

480.36 --> 487.08000000000004
I can't then like shut my computer off

483.12 --> 489.0
start I have to shut it off to reset it

487.08 --> 490.96
cuz the only way to reset it is by

489.0 --> 493.56
literally turning off the

490.96 --> 496.31899999999996
electricity but that yeah turns off my

493.56 --> 500.039
computer and thereby this stream is

496.319 --> 502.159
ended one way or the other there's no

500.039 --> 505.639
way that I can like if my internet cuts

502.159 --> 511.24

piece of paper and assigned

684.48 --> 690.0790000000001
Authority and then of course you have to

686.959 --> 692.079
believe it because the majority or the

690.079 --> 694.3199999999999
government says it's real and everything

692.079 --> 700.279
the government says is real it has to be

694.32 --> 700.279
real right I mean just look around you

715.079 --> 720.959
government so it must be good huh

717.959 --> 720.959
[ __ ]

733.04 --> 738.8389999999999
[ __ ] is this a flat Earth stream it's

737.16 --> 741.6
also Flat

738.839 --> 743.6800000000001
Earth I mean it's not yeah Flat Earth is

741.6 --> 746.0
in the title but it's not just like I

743.68 --> 748.04
only talk about Flat Earth I barely talk

746.0 --> 750.279
about flat I'm actually kind of happy

748.04 --> 753.399
that the dip [ __ ] just came in my chat

750.279 --> 753.399
so definitely don't ban

754.399 --> 762.76
him I mean I like a good Bard every now

758.92 --> 765.04
and then that like remind me of like

762.76 --> 769.88
just

765.04 --> 773.04
have yeah do what I do show that other

769.88 --> 775.199
side remind myself that no matter like

773.04 --> 777.88
how well I'm

775.199 --> 779.8389999999999
doing there will always be a [ __ ]

777.88 --> 782.88
Ballard out there that would just not

779.839 --> 782.8800000000001
see what I'm

784.639 --> 791.04
doing right I have to remind myself

787.72 --> 793.1600000000001
because I always think that if I just

791.04 --> 795.279
keep going and I do better that

793.16 --> 798.16
everybody will be doing better and they

795.279 --> 801.04
all will understand but there's just

798.16 --> 804.76
people out there just that just don't

801.04 --> 808.12
get it no matter how much you explain

804.76 --> 810.6
it and refine it and and and be good

808.12 --> 813.839
with it they just won't get

810.6 --> 815.6
it because they're [ __ ] they don't

813.839 --> 816.6800000000001
have the sensibilities they don't have

815.6 --> 819.6
the

816.68 --> 823.4799999999999
sensories they don't have the formatting

819.6 --> 826.16
the internal formatting of

823.48 --> 828.76
like composing yourself in a way that

826.16 --> 832.16
you're Dynamic enough to actually figure

828.76 --> 836.959
out how things really work on a wider

832.16 --> 839.8
scale and just fall back to standardized

836.959 --> 842.7589999999999
programming like yeah I I don't

839.8 --> 847.639
understand so I'm going to just trust on

842.759 --> 850.0790000000001
what the majority or the authority says

847.639 --> 853.04
because that's safe because everybody

850.079 --> 856.6389999999999
does that right like yeah you don't need

853.04 --> 858.639
to know anything have a grip on reality

856.639 --> 863.0790000000001
to just do what they

858.639 --> 865.24
say yeah that's called being a slave or

863.079 --> 867.68
mind control slave if you

865.24 --> 870.6800000000001
will yeah I'm not doing

867.68 --> 870.68
that

877.04 --> 881.56
yeah Ben Johnson I

878.8 --> 884.68

input you save the people that were

look who's talking

1148.84 --> 1153.6399999999999
duper you can't make that remark at this

1160.52 --> 1164.559
point is German new medicine popular in

1163.72 --> 1167.76
the

1164.559 --> 1170.2
Netherlands no German new medicine is

1167.76 --> 1173.44
not really popular

1170.2 --> 1176.0800000000002
anywhere I mean you know why because

1173.44 --> 1177.8400000000001
German new medicine tells you not to get

1176.08 --> 1180.96
like

1177.84 --> 1183.12
anything like including pain medication

1180.96 --> 1186.72
and so anything that tells you not to

1183.12 --> 1188.7199999999998
get pain medication is surprise surprise

1186.72 --> 1191.96
not going to be very

1188.72 --> 1195.64
popular you get

1191.96 --> 1198.0

[Music]

1254.32 --> 1260.12
day okay okay take it easy now

that I also know where he came

1285.159 --> 1291.6000000000001
from yeah he actually gave me

1288.679 --> 1294.44
a background which is not what sock

did not do that he actually introduced

1301.96 --> 1305.679
himself told me where he came

1305.799 --> 1311.6399999999999
from and it's been a very pleasant

1308.799 --> 1314.9189999999999

complaints

1545.88 --> 1551.0
that was a live space launch yesterday

1548.679 --> 1551.0
oh

1552.159 --> 1556.1200000000001
okay I didn't even notice

1556.679 --> 1562.72
it

1558.76 --> 1562.72
which one where

1570.24 --> 1575.919
now it's in the ocean I'm sure it is but

1577.159 --> 1582.0
where who did it was it United States

1584.68 --> 1589.6000000000001
[Music]

1586.6 --> 1589.6
again

1593.72 --> 1598.3600000000001
yeah I mean I don't really get any space

1595.919 --> 1600.919
updates the only space updates I get are

1598.36 --> 1600.9189999999999
from you

1616.6 --> 1619.6
guys

1627.76 --> 1630.799
okay fair enough Billy

1631.6 --> 1636.84
bars right good to see you around again

1634.84 --> 1640.039
gaining wisdom I haven't seen you around

1636.84 --> 1643.72
for a long time what's

1640.039 --> 1643.72
happened what's been going

1646.52 --> 1649.52
on

1673.84 --> 1681.8799999999999
what last thing I heard Richard is G

1678.679 --> 1686.2
is that there was some robot moon

1681.88 --> 1690.679
landing thing and then it like

1686.2 --> 1694.48
damaged when it landed it broke that's

1690.679 --> 1696.0
the last thing I I heard so whatever is

1694.48 --> 1700.559
going on I have no

1696.0 --> 1702.88
idea at this point I get all my space

1700.559 --> 1705.6789999999999
launch blah blah blah information

1702.88 --> 1708.24
through you guys in the

1705.679 --> 1711.5590000000002
chat I mean and that works because I

1708.24 --> 1711.559
have an everyday show

1712.08 --> 1716.08
so it fell over

1717.37 --> 1720.51
[Music]

1725.559 --> 1730.399
right yeah they should have built in a

1728.039 --> 1730.399
tip

1730.6 --> 1735.9189999999999
assist right remember tip assist from

1733.32 --> 1738.36
the South Park episode where everybody

1735.919 --> 1740.48
got all fat and in cars and then people

1738.36 --> 1743.0
started to throw them over because they

1740.48 --> 1745.88
were just so

1743.0 --> 1748.039
annoying and then somebody invented a

1745.88 --> 1749.72
system where if they got fallen over

1748.039 --> 1751.679
that you could just with a push of a

1749.72 --> 1755.32
button stick would just like push you

1751.679 --> 1757.64
back up again so maybe those moon

1755.32 --> 1760.559
landing things need a tip assist if they

1757.64 --> 1764.919
just fall over that they could

1760.559 --> 1764.9189999999999
just put themsel right back

1766.32 --> 1769.32
up

1773.29 --> 1776.74
[Music]

1781.399 --> 1786.84
I mean this sounds really silly but

1784.12 --> 1790.039
theoretically if it were real I mean

1786.84 --> 1792.36
yeah why not here I go with the Ballwin

1790.039 --> 1794.399
again it's like yeah I mean tip assist

1792.36 --> 1796.32
is pretty good idea actually for

1794.399 --> 1799.1999999999998
something like

1796.32 --> 1801.399
that like no matter how you do it like

1799.2 --> 1803.159
even if you have like an inflatable ball

1801.399 --> 1805.1999999999998
you remember that idea when they said

1803.159 --> 1807.88
like oh you just have a giant

1805.2 --> 1809.64
ball that just like inflates as it's

1807.88 --> 1810.7990000000002
going to land and then the whole module

1809.64 --> 1814.72
is on the

1810.799 --> 1817.0
inside right and then when it stops IT

1814.72 --> 1819.3600000000001
deflates

1817.0 --> 1822.799
Etc but how do you know it's going to

1819.36 --> 1822.799
even be the right side up or

1826.24 --> 1829.24
anything

1830.039 --> 1836.72
you've been in helmet

1832.519 --> 1839.679
mode do that from time to time is that a

1836.72 --> 1839.679
Darth helmet

1856.24 --> 1859.24
reference

1867.679 --> 1871.039
anyway yeah glad to have you

1872.33 --> 1877.4299999999998
[Music]

1886.159 --> 1890.88
back

1888.36 --> 1892.8799999999999
images back from the Fallen Lander dude

1890.88 --> 1896.7990000000002
I don't even know why there isn't some

1892.88 --> 1898.7990000000002
kind of like I do know why but

1896.799 --> 1902.08
theoretically if space were real it was

1898.799 --> 1904.24
all real like how hard can it be to just

1902.08 --> 1905.6789999999999
like send a rocket to the moon not to

1904.24 --> 1908.639
land on

1905.679 --> 1911.8400000000001
it but to like

1908.639 --> 1915.4399999999998
make like really

1911.84 --> 1917.6789999999999
closeup like comparable to satellite

1915.44 --> 1920.88
images basically fly over it and

1917.679 --> 1924.3990000000001
photograph the surface of the Moon to

1920.88 --> 1926.5590000000002
like get close enough to get to see all

1924.399 --> 1928.6
the activity that's happened there like

1926.559 --> 1931.6789999999999
oh where's the the remnant of the

1928.6 --> 1934.9599999999998
original moonlander oh where's the flag

1931.679 --> 1938.44
planted oh where's where did this thing

1934.96 --> 1941.0
crash back then to like see all the moon

1938.44 --> 1942.519
landings basically that have supposedly

1941.0 --> 1945.639
happened like oh where's the Chinese

1942.519 --> 1947.76
little car thing

1945.639 --> 1951.519
right why is

1947.76 --> 1953.399
just fly over the moon not land on it

1951.519 --> 1955.0
it's way too complicated right just fly

1953.399 --> 1957.4399999999998
over it just make a bunch of photographs

1955.0 --> 1960.039
or live footage it would be even better

1957.44 --> 1961.72
and then go back and then we got like

1960.039 --> 1963.919
this closeup

1961.72 --> 1965.919
footage right and that and that would

1963.919 --> 1968.1200000000001
like secure everybody's worry that it

1965.919 --> 1970.3600000000001
might all be fake right it's like oh no

1968.12 --> 1974.12
no look we we actually got the evidence

1970.36 --> 1978.799
here we see we did a special flyby and

1974.12 --> 1980.76
we got like satellite qual quity imagery

1978.799 --> 1982.72
of the surface of the Moon with all the

1980.76 --> 1985.039
Landers on it and where they

1982.72 --> 1988.2
are I

1985.039 --> 1991.279
mean I think that would really

1988.2 --> 1993.76
appeal to the

1991.279 --> 1999.799
Believers anyway but it it's probably

1993.76 --> 1999.799
just like too complicated to do that

2003.65 --> 2008.96
[Music]

2005.96 --> 2008.96
right

2011.279 --> 2016.799
Bean done

2014.12 --> 2020.639
right I'm sure it

2016.799 --> 2024.0
has maybe like in the 70s or

2020.639 --> 2024.0
something or the

2026.76 --> 2032.279
80s but not yeah I

2029.0 --> 2037.2
mean the aramus thing I remember that

2032.279 --> 2039.159
the emus but I mean it wasn't really all

2037.2 --> 2043.96
that close by the

2039.159 --> 2047.159
moon and it looked like 80s quality

2043.96 --> 2047.159
computer graphic

2048.399 --> 2054.1189999999997
so ever heard of Google yeah I've heard

2052.119 --> 2055.8790000000004
of Google oh they have it now they have

2054.119 --> 2058.32
the moon surface

2055.879 --> 2062.72
[ __ ]

2058.32 --> 2062.7200000000003
really is there a Google moon

2065.879 --> 2068.879
now

2081.78 --> 2085.03
[Music]

2095.879 --> 2098.879
okay

2106.23 --> 2110.07
[Music]

2115.22 --> 2118.7099999999996
[Music]

2125.8 --> 2130.6800000000003
for

2128.16 --> 2134.64
modification to the time a little

2130.68 --> 2137.16
bit unqualified but

2134.64 --> 2138.7599999999998
effective I mean that's those

2137.16 --> 2141.359
combination of words is something

2138.76 --> 2143.7200000000003
important they just universally keep in

2141.359 --> 2143.72
mind

2144.56 --> 2150.52
now like who is assigning the

2147.04 --> 2153.599
qualification you know is

2150.52 --> 2157.44
it provable

2153.599 --> 2160.8
Liars like with that Pro proven track

2157.44 --> 2162.119
record of proven lies are those the the

2160.8 --> 2164.28
qualified

2162.119 --> 2166.319
people how about their effect

2164.28 --> 2168.8390000000004
effectivity are they

2166.319 --> 2171.56
effective what they're supposedly what

2168.839 --> 2173.64
they're supposed to do or do they just

2171.56 --> 2177.48
accidentally keep mocking up everything

2173.64 --> 2180.96
they touch right I'd rather way rather

2177.48 --> 2183.44
be unqualified but effective

2180.96 --> 2187.68
right I mean who needs a freaking

2183.44 --> 2190.56
qualification when you can just do it

2187.68 --> 2192.16
yeah like oh but if you want to do it

2190.56 --> 2194.0789999999997
professionally you want to make money

2192.16 --> 2196.52
then you need a qualification blah blah

2194.079 --> 2198.3590000000004
yeah sure right so how about I just do

2196.52 --> 2202.599
it for

2198.359 --> 2205.52
free just do it for free and like take

2202.599 --> 2208.52
donations like that are not related to

2205.52 --> 2210.359
like as a direct payment for a service

2208.52 --> 2213.2
it's just like no I'll I'll just do

2210.359 --> 2214.56
anything for free and if somebody wants

2213.2 --> 2217.9199999999996
to give me

2214.56 --> 2221.24
something I'll take it I'll be very

2217.92 --> 2223.7200000000003
thankful it will not it will officially

2221.24 --> 2228.1189999999997
not be connected to any actions that I

2223.72 --> 2232.0789999999997
do other than I'm just here doing

2228.119 --> 2234.52
this in general like I'm spending my

2232.079 --> 2238.599
time with you guys and having a YouTube

2234.52 --> 2238.599
channel and and that's

2240.68 --> 2246.7999999999997
it would I let an Amateur Surgeon work

2243.48 --> 2249.599
on me if it's urgent enough and there

2246.8 --> 2249.599
was no other

2255.319 --> 2262.52
options and I trusted the person I mean

2258.72 --> 2267.16
me actually trusting the person to me is

2262.52 --> 2269.56
like way more important and hey qualify

2267.16 --> 2272.2
qualification within

2269.56 --> 2274.839
surgery like that

2272.2 --> 2278.5989999999997
is the thing is that like they have so

2274.839 --> 2278.599
much to lose by doing it wrong

2278.72 --> 2283.0
that that makes it a little bit more

2281.119 --> 2285.119
reliable even if you have no idea who

2283.0 --> 2285.119
they

2291.119 --> 2294.119
are

2297.0 --> 2300.0
right

2300.24 --> 2306.9199999999996
so right would you let an amateur do

2303.92 --> 2310.04
surgeon on you when you know if they

2306.92 --> 2312.319
didn't you would be guaranteed to die

2310.04 --> 2315.0
and there's literally you're in the

2312.319 --> 2317.72
middle of nowhere it's like you're in

2315.0 --> 2320.92
the jungle you got really wounded you

2317.72 --> 2323.0789999999997
got a problem it needs to be fixed

2320.92 --> 2325.48
immediately you don't even have the

2323.079 --> 2326.8
proper tools you just have some basic

2325.48 --> 2331.44
knife

2326.8 --> 2334.28
and and a yeah a lighter or

2331.44 --> 2336.2400000000002
whatever what would you just die or

2334.28 --> 2338.1600000000003
would you let the guy that's like Yeah

2336.24 --> 2340.0789999999997
I'm really interested in surgery but I

2338.16 --> 2342.0
never really made it past the school

2340.079 --> 2344.92
would you not let him operate on you

2342.0 --> 2349.16
solar BRS if you knew you were going to

2344.92 --> 2352.16
die H how about that how about that

2349.16 --> 2352.16
question

2359.2 --> 2363.68
huh hey slow M moon buggy good to see

2365.44 --> 2368.44
you

2370.16 --> 2375.92
what get

2372.68 --> 2375.9199999999996
drafted the

2395.4 --> 2398.4
[ __ ]

2425.359 --> 2428.359
all

2436.24 --> 2441.64
hey where do you see Anan kataris I

2439.28 --> 2441.6400000000003

him did I miss

2447.44 --> 2452.92
it I don't see anian cathares where is

2455.16 --> 2463.96
he why what what's going on

2458.64 --> 2463.96
here oh there you are

2485.24 --> 2488.24
hello

2489.11 --> 2492.199
[Music]

2514.319 --> 2518.24
oh that's weird

2518.359 --> 2523.2
anian

2520.839 --> 2525.7999999999997
catharsis that's really weird when that

2523.2 --> 2525.7999999999997
kind of stuff

2545.16 --> 2548.16
happens

2575.16 --> 2580.44
that's

2577.44 --> 2582.92
they've got key word words key that they

2580.44 --> 2586.319
won't let you toss

2582.92 --> 2586.319
through I don't

2588.92 --> 2597.359
know maybe it's for me it's like tough

2593.64 --> 2600.1189999999997
to figure out I really think it's like

2597.359 --> 2602.52
they do it personally like certain

2600.119 --> 2605.079
accounts have that issue other people

2602.52 --> 2607.2
just don't they can say whatever they

2605.079 --> 2611.079
like

2607.2 --> 2615.96
I don't know why some with certain

2611.079 --> 2615.96
people it tends to happen it's very

2620.0 --> 2626.64
odd hey flatter Sage could see

2624.24 --> 2628.839
you pretty good video yesterday after

2626.64 --> 2631.5099999999998
the three- hour mark

2628.839 --> 2635.0789999999997
thanks yeah I suddenly woke

2631.51 --> 2638.079
[Music]

2635.079 --> 2638.079
up

2639.359 --> 2643.92
I should like watch back even what I was

2641.2 --> 2643.9199999999996
talking about I don't

2645.04 --> 2650.319
remember but I I feel like I'm doing

2648.04 --> 2653.04
better now universally I

2650.319 --> 2655.04
mean coffee is like working out for me

2653.04 --> 2658.64
I'm not like chugging it

2655.04 --> 2660.2
but it's a little much

2658.64 --> 2662.319
like

2660.2 --> 2665.68
yeah but I

2662.319 --> 2666.88
mean a really important factor overall

2665.68 --> 2669.24
has been in

2666.88 --> 2671.44
like the Cannabis

2669.24 --> 2673.0
stuff it seems

2671.44 --> 2677.599
like

2673.0 --> 2681.88
I've outgrown it weirdly

2677.599 --> 2684.2400000000002
enough or the state in which I am which

2681.88 --> 2686.7200000000003
is not just detrimental I mean there is

2684.24 --> 2689.839
good sides to it it's like I've become

2686.72 --> 2693.16
over sensitive to it and every time I

2689.839 --> 2697.52
take it I I anticipate like oh yeah I'm

2693.16 --> 2700.5589999999997
just gonna like chill and and oh

2697.52 --> 2702.44
but then it doesn't do that it does

2700.559 --> 2705.8390000000004
something else and it makes me like

2702.44 --> 2709.92
suddenly anxious it's

2705.839 --> 2709.92
weird and that really happened

2712.16 --> 2716.72
recently it didn't do that before that

2714.599 --> 2717.839
before that it was like just smoking one

2716.72 --> 2720.48
after

2717.839 --> 2724.359
another that literally chain smoking but

2720.48 --> 2727.079
I was like smoking plenty at times and

2724.359 --> 2728.72
now it's not I still have the stuff it

2727.079 --> 2730.52
just I'm not touching and I put it back

2728.72 --> 2732.9599999999996
in the drawer and I'm like oh I'm just

2730.52 --> 2735.88
doing tobacco now and

2732.96 --> 2739.2400000000002
that's and that's it and it's way better

2735.88 --> 2742.2400000000002
because because of that I just don't

2739.24 --> 2742.24
have as much

2742.52 --> 2746.96
anxiety but it does take some getting

2744.72 --> 2746.9599999999996
used

2754.88 --> 2757.88
to

2772.8 --> 2778.599
I be worried about any kind of choid

2775.72 --> 2781.16
affecting The receptors in my brain yeah

2778.599 --> 2781.1600000000003
maybe I

2784.8 --> 2788.6400000000003
guess

2787.319 --> 2792.2
okay flatter

2788.64 --> 2794.16
Sage right yeah maybe it's not just me

2792.2 --> 2797.52
maybe it

2794.16 --> 2800.0
is a universal

2797.52 --> 2803.44
influence maybe something did like

2800.0 --> 2806.72
happen more pronouncedly in the

2803.44 --> 2810.079
world I mean I had like a conversations

2806.72 --> 2812.5989999999997
about this effect like how it said like

2810.079 --> 2815.119
oh I'm being influ I'm very influenced

2812.599 --> 2819.04
by by astrology or like where the Moon

2815.119 --> 2821.48
is at is it full is it not full right

2819.04 --> 2824.319
and the phases in the year like the

2821.48 --> 2827.68
special 12 Dark Days around

2824.319 --> 2830.5589999999997
Christmas and

2827.68 --> 2832.7599999999998
Springtime and I'm I'm just I'm never

2830.559 --> 2834.44
I'm not really sure whether it's like oh

2832.76 --> 2836.8
it's just the springtime that's just

2834.44 --> 2839.76
doing it or whether it's like no there's

2836.8 --> 2843.04
something even more on top of

2839.76 --> 2846.599
that I'm not sure but there are things

2843.04 --> 2848.92
in the air there is like a a pronounced

2846.599 --> 2851.599
energy of

2848.92 --> 2857.28
change there's something

2851.599 --> 2858.52
more out there now and people are

2857.28 --> 2862.3190000000004
picking it

2858.52 --> 2865.68
up and because that extra energy is

2862.319 --> 2869.24
there it does really it that does make

2865.68 --> 2873.44
it feel like I'm Different like my

2869.24 --> 2878.5589999999997
workings are different now because it's

2873.44 --> 2881.7200000000003
there it's weird but that's what I'm

2878.559 --> 2884.96
feeling it's been there for a while and

2881.72 --> 2887.64
I got like more clarity I can better

2884.96 --> 2892.079
work through my Dark World Visions and

2887.64 --> 2895.04
like put them into context better etc

2892.079 --> 2897.4
etc no Chris Matt and it's not going to

2895.04 --> 2897.4
happen

2904.64 --> 2907.64
either

2915.44 --> 2918.51
[Music]

2925.16 --> 2927.64
I'm moving

2934.599 --> 2940.6800000000003
on won't be going back to the dark world

2937.839 --> 2942.839
again misremembering yeah that's just

2940.68 --> 2947.16
I'm not going to like

2942.839 --> 2950.599
actively try to do drugs to go back to

2947.16 --> 2953.359
the actual experience duper but I mean

2950.599 --> 2953.3590000000004
it's still

2953.4 --> 2959.2000000000003
there

2955.44 --> 2962.16
parallel to my waking

2959.2 --> 2964.52
experience like that's ongoing I don't

2962.16 --> 2967.52
think that'll ever like really go

2964.52 --> 2967.52
away

2988.76 --> 2992.559
want excuse this smoke more yeah well

2990.96 --> 2996.16
flatter Sage I

2992.559 --> 2998.0400000000004
mean it's up to you man it's it's also

2996.16 --> 3000.359
maybe a matter of

2998.04 --> 3003.2799999999997
discipline right I mean if you can do it

3000.359 --> 3003.2799999999997
to like make

3008.52 --> 3013.559
money but yeah you just have to

3024.44 --> 3027.44
decide

3054.44 --> 3057.44
right

3064.92 --> 3068.2000000000003
people with schizophrenia experience the

3066.96 --> 3071.04
Dark

3068.2 --> 3075.2799999999997
World

3071.04 --> 3077.599
H or is it that a different thing it's

3075.28 --> 3080.96
complicated duper I'm not

3077.599 --> 3084.3590000000004
sure I think actual schizophrenia is

3080.96 --> 3086.92
like way worse than anything that I

3084.359 --> 3089.72
experience

3086.92 --> 3092.88
because actual schizophrenia you like

3089.72 --> 3097.1189999999997
really have very distinct

3092.88 --> 3097.119
unconnected personalities about

3100.24 --> 3105.839
you I don't have that I'm definitely

3103.559 --> 3105.8390000000004
just

3107.119 --> 3113.2400000000002
me so it's

3109.88 --> 3116.4
different I mean what I have is in a way

3113.24 --> 3118.52
I guess kind of unique

3116.4 --> 3121.119
I've never really been able to

3118.52 --> 3124.52
like talk about it and then get a

3121.119 --> 3127.599
definitive like oh yeah this is exactly

3124.52 --> 3130.68
this profile this is what you got never

3127.599 --> 3136.04
never had that

3130.68 --> 3143.68
happen and hey when I was younger

3136.04 --> 3146.0
like between 15 and 25 I did go like to

3143.68 --> 3148.5589999999997
some kind of counselor and all that and

3146.0 --> 3151.88
did talk about it and they just couldn't

3148.559 --> 3153.6800000000003
figure it out they just had no idea like

3151.88 --> 3155.4
this is something really weird that this

3153.68 --> 3158.0
guy is experiencing they didn't they

3155.4 --> 3159.88
don't know they thought at first like oh

3158.0 --> 3160.559
is it like some kind of skitso thing but

3159.88 --> 3164.28
I

3160.559 --> 3168.3190000000004
mean it never they never got like this

3164.28 --> 3172.0
yeah it's this definitely no I am not

3168.319 --> 3174.64
fitting any specific type of profile in

3172.0 --> 3177.24
that sense of mental illnesses or

3174.64 --> 3177.24
whatever

3180.68 --> 3185.3999999999996
when will you get the gifts and go

3183.16 --> 3188.7599999999998
money

3185.4 --> 3188.76
uh I don't

3193.119 --> 3199.44
know why are you so freaking interesting

3195.88 --> 3199.44
in the gifts and go money s

3202.04 --> 3207.16
rooms

3204.16 --> 3207.16
why

3234.16 --> 3237.16
e

3273.52 --> 3277.04
yoga gu

3294.079 --> 3297.079
okay

3311.68 --> 3317.5589999999997
type I've

3314.319 --> 3317.5589999999997
described it

3318.599 --> 3321.599
does

3324.0 --> 3327.0
okay

3329.119 --> 3333.4
well I've actually like talked with my

3333.64 --> 3337.8799999999997
counselor from yeah from the city and

3336.72 --> 3341.72
all that

3337.88 --> 3344.559
here they have experience with like

3341.72 --> 3345.839
hallucinogens too like in a very

3344.559 --> 3348.88
controlled

3345.839 --> 3351.4
way and like I've been able to talk

3348.88 --> 3353.2400000000002
about like Dark World experiences and

3351.4 --> 3355.44
how I relate to them and what happened

3353.24 --> 3357.68
back then and how they're in in a way

3355.44 --> 3360.16
still plaguing me and how I'm trying to

3357.68 --> 3362.5989999999997
figure out he's been like really

3360.16 --> 3364.3999999999996
understanding of it because well he has

3362.599 --> 3368.52
experiences with

3364.4 --> 3372.2400000000002
it in a much more controlled setup like

3368.52 --> 3376.52
proper ceremonies with proper

3372.24 --> 3376.52
people around

3377.96 --> 3385.799
so and he feels confident about what

3382.16 --> 3387.96
I've experienced that that he can

3385.799 --> 3391.079
like that he gets it there's there's no

3387.96 --> 3393.7200000000003
mystery to him in it he just says like

3391.079 --> 3397.0
yeah that makes sense like it's familiar

3393.72 --> 3397.0
the things how I describe

3405.2 --> 3409.64
it hey singing starwater good to see

3413.88 --> 3416.88
you

3436.079 --> 3442.48
the ban you from fbd live chat yesterday

3439.119 --> 3445.559
yeah well I expect most people here to

3442.48 --> 3448.2
be actually people that will like to

3445.559 --> 3449.8390000000004
hang around here anticipate that they're

3448.2 --> 3452.359
going to ban you at

3449.839 --> 3456.5589999999997
fed I'm just telling

3452.359 --> 3456.5589999999997
you there's nothing I can do about

3457.4 --> 3463.559
it if I prob if i' show up in the chat

3460.359 --> 3463.5589999999997
they'd probably ban me

3465.92 --> 3469.48
too I'm not even

3470.76 --> 3476.28
joking like it's been

3473.48 --> 3480.079
weird but

3476.28 --> 3480.079
I don't think I'm like welcome back

3491.64 --> 3499.2
Really they haven't just overtly told me

3495.319 --> 3501.64
that but that's very much the impression

3499.2 --> 3501.64
that I've

3502.44 --> 3508.28
had and to be fair

3505.559 --> 3511.3590000000004
I'm really kind of happy just doing this

3508.28 --> 3513.88
with you guys I'm very happy with you

3527.44 --> 3534.839
apologized yeah went through like

3531.64 --> 3538.0789999999997
humiliation for that and I meant it like

3534.839 --> 3542.119
I I was completely beside

3538.079 --> 3543.6400000000003
myself with anger and frustration and

3542.119 --> 3546.6400000000003
being freaked

3543.64 --> 3550.92
out and then that

3546.64 --> 3550.92

4519.719 --> 4525.2390000000005
like people that just like make all

4523.48 --> 4528.32
these claims about other people

4525.239 --> 4532.12
especially rich people I'm just like not

4528.32 --> 4532.12
really overtly trusting that

4532.8 --> 4540.2390000000005
anymore cuz people just in their envy

4537.08 --> 4542.44
and jealousy and bitterness just make up

4540.239 --> 4545.12
really dark [ __ ] about other

4542.44 --> 4547.5199999999995
people they just do and then they all

4545.12 --> 4550.08
like make a consensus oh this is what we

4547.52 --> 4550.080000000001
think he

4552.199 --> 4555.199
does

4582.12 --> 4585.12

4640.08 --> 4645.0
somewhat less than Pleasant side effect

4646.639 --> 4652.159000000001
then again this is like the first time

4648.52 --> 4654.84
in over two weeks that I had a full cup

4652.159 --> 4657.879999999999
of coffee like this

4654.84 --> 4661.04
so it's maybe a bit much to like take an

4657.88 --> 4664.12
entire cup of coffee like that I mean

4661.04 --> 4666.28
it's pretty huge cup you know this is

4664.12 --> 4669.719
quite a

4666.28 --> 4673.199
bit so next time I'm going to like like

4669.719 --> 4675.92
do half of it it's just so weird man man

4673.199 --> 4679.28
my entire physiology is just

4675.92 --> 4683.679
changed like I eat differently I eat

better than yesterday at least not

4889.36 --> 4897.759999999999
difficult you had my pastry

4892.88 --> 4902.0
today uh no not well not yet technically

4897.76 --> 4906.159000000001
I have Illuminati Cosmos I have a lot of

4902.0 --> 4908.88
them but I ate something different

4906.159 --> 4908.879999999999
before the

4909.32 --> 4914.639
show and that was really satisfying

4919.44 --> 4925.96
it's like my food's just different but I

4923.76 --> 4932.280000000001
found like this Combi that just works

4925.96 --> 4935.04
really well which is like just regular

4932.28 --> 4938.239
bread the type that I like spell type

4935.04 --> 4944.56
bread and all that which is like great

4938.239 --> 4944.5599999999995
bread with surprise surprise liver work

4945.6 --> 4952.84
specific beef liver worse because most

4947.719 --> 4957.32
of it is usually like uh Pig

4952.84 --> 4960.84
based but they had specific organic beef

4957.32 --> 4963.5599999999995
liver worst and then I add the rooka on

4960.84 --> 4966.76
top of that and that works really well

4963.56 --> 4969.84
together like it's very healthy it feels

4966.76 --> 4975.12
very nourishing and doesn't like fill me

4969.84 --> 4975.12
up too much so I've been really liking

4977.56 --> 4982.76
that it works in the morning and it

4980.52 --> 4984.080000000001
works at night like yesterday I didn't

4982.76 --> 4987.320000000001
really have

4984.08 --> 4991.04
dinner but I did have

4987.32 --> 4991.04

4996.76 --> 5003.37
great eggs coming out of your ears

bread

5070.159 --> 5074.5199999999995
oh really they do W work kind that's

5076.56 --> 5082.2390000000005
interesting no debatable the 50 cents

5079.6 --> 5084.320000000001
per egg of

5082.239 --> 5090.718999999999
course

5084.32 --> 5090.719
seriously are you all there debatable D

5091.36 --> 5094.36

5110.239 --> 5115.04
wait per

5112.04 --> 5115.04
bird

5115.679 --> 5121.679
what that's

5118.679 --> 5125.8
crazy so they're just giving him away

5121.679 --> 5125.8
basically it's that point I

5140.119 --> 5144.679
guess yeah no I'm kind of shocked

5147.04 --> 5153.679
too eggs are not so

5150.44 --> 5157.44
healthy uh

5153.679 --> 5161.719
what planet are you living on borders

5157.44 --> 5165.08
boy seriously like what do you mean

5161.719 --> 5165.08
cholesterol not

5168.0 --> 5175.36
healthy you got it all wrong it is

5172.36 --> 5175.36
exceptionally

5181.199 --> 5184.199
healthy

5205.36 --> 5209.599999999999
industrial Chicken F yeah industrial

5207.159 --> 5211.96
chicken FMS but I mean like that's

5209.6 --> 5213.159000000001
terrible situation very unnatural and

5211.96 --> 5215.679
they're all

5213.159 --> 5218.5599999999995
stressed all that stress is just like

5215.679 --> 5218.56
not healthy for the

5228.4 --> 5235.239
eggs bord yeah no the it just makes no

5232.04 --> 5238.159
damn sense what bord boy said is just as

5235.239 --> 5244.119
wrong as you can

5238.159 --> 5244.119
get yeah you need cholesterol it's

5244.36 --> 5248.36
essential

5246.119 --> 5250.88
yeah what do you think your brain

5248.36 --> 5253.04
consists

5250.88 --> 5256.719
of like you

5253.04 --> 5259.92
need that stuff you need those

5256.719 --> 5259.92
fats a

5265.0 --> 5271.119
lot like people can survive on a diet of

5269.199 --> 5274.119
eggs

5271.119 --> 5274.119
alone

5276.52 --> 5279.88
yeah so I don't know where the hell he's

5279.04 --> 5282.679
getting

5279.88 --> 5284.84
it but I mean every time I see anybody

5282.679 --> 5287.119
say oh cholesterol not healthy it's like

5284.84 --> 5290.0
what according to the freaking food

5287.119 --> 5292.5599999999995
pyramid nonsense that's completely

5290.0 --> 5294.44
inside out yeah according to that it's

5292.56 --> 5297.84
oh you got to avoid that oh yeah I'm

5294.44 --> 5297.839999999999
sure that's going to be great for your

5299.96 --> 5308.4
brain like by that same standard like

5302.679 --> 5311.88
sugar Replacements are good right it's

5308.4 --> 5316.36
nonsense cholesterol is essential just

5311.88 --> 5318.08
don't ruin it right cholesterol will

5316.36 --> 5321.639
also

5318.08 --> 5325.84
be having like things like pesticides in

5321.639 --> 5330.04
them if that's been involved yeah bio

5325.84 --> 5332.28
accumulative fat soluble pesticides yeah

5330.04 --> 5334.92
if that's in there then that will be be

5332.28 --> 5336.759999999999
very bad cholesterol for you because it

5334.92 --> 5338.719
will be like a delivery mechanism for

5336.76 --> 5341.84
the

5338.719 --> 5345.0
poison and that's like it if you have

5341.84 --> 5348.96
clean organic eggs like that's you need

5345.0 --> 5348.96
that you need that a

5360.92 --> 5363.92

5726.28 --> 5728.84
just want

5728.88 --> 5735.119
that

5731.04 --> 5738.08
right I mean I don't want the chat to be

5735.119 --> 5739.639
like and people like because then I I

5738.08 --> 5742.88
wouldn't be able to like have a

5739.639 --> 5746.28
conversation if it would just like be 20

5742.88 --> 5749.56
or 30 people just blabbering away in the

5746.28 --> 5753.28
chat like how can you even maintain

5749.56 --> 5756.1990000000005
order right

5753.28 --> 5757.36
which be much more difficult it's just

5756.199 --> 5761.48
like the

5757.36 --> 5765.159
same as like with a with a class of

5761.48 --> 5768.5599999999995
students like what's easier to manage a

5765.159 --> 5770.239
class that has 10 students or a class

5768.56 --> 5772.679
that has 30

5770.239 --> 5775.4
students

5772.679 --> 5779.56
right the class with 10 students is

5775.4 --> 5782.879999999999
going to have like much more individual

5779.56 --> 5786.080000000001
attention and like if will just work way

5782.88 --> 5788.159000000001
better than with 30 where just like

5786.08 --> 5790.32
potentially half the people are going to

5788.159 --> 5793.199
be misunderstood and

5790.32 --> 5795.5599999999995
neglected and that's like well known

5793.199 --> 5798.94
like that's officially

5795.56 --> 5802.05
known in the teaching

5798.94 --> 5802.049999999999
[Music]

5807.96 --> 5813.199
profession so I mean anybody that wants

5811.04 --> 5815.28
that I wish you the best of luck and I'm

5813.199 --> 5818.879999999999
like I'm rooting for you like I hope you

5815.28 --> 5821.04
get really big I really do I mean

5818.88 --> 5823.04
it I don't

5821.04 --> 5825.32
care for

5823.04 --> 5829.5199999999995
me I just

5825.32 --> 5832.159
want a chat with people that I feel I

5829.52 --> 5837.679
can rely

5832.159 --> 5840.199
upon and that will grow with me in

5837.679 --> 5846.4800000000005
spirit yeah I don't

5840.199 --> 5846.48
need like an army of

5847.0 --> 5853.08
puppets or people that'll just blindly

5850.08 --> 5855.5199999999995
say and do whatever I tell them I don't

5853.08 --> 5855.5199999999995
want

5856.36 --> 5862.5599999999995
that I want to be surrounded by people

5860.239 --> 5865.44
that and here here it is this is

5862.56 --> 5866.84
important that if I'd have a serious

5865.44 --> 5870.199
mental

5866.84 --> 5872.679
breakdown that you don't all just

5870.199 --> 5874.96
scatter

5872.679 --> 5881.56
but that you'd actually be able to get

5874.96 --> 5885.96
me back on top again that's what I

5881.56 --> 5889.679
need reliable people that get

5885.96 --> 5891.56
me and that won't just walk away as soon

5889.679 --> 5894.0
as I

5891.56 --> 5896.0
crumble I mean if I suddenly became like

5894.0 --> 5898.96
this weird vicious liar or something

5896.0 --> 5900.32
yeah I totally get that you would like a

5898.96 --> 5901.92
lot of you would probably scatter it and

5900.32 --> 5903.599
that's not going to happen

5901.92 --> 5906.56
like I never do

5903.599 --> 5908.96
that I don't have that I I would have to

5906.56 --> 5910.2390000000005
like literally go clinically insane for

5908.96 --> 5912.28
that to

5910.239 --> 5913.799999999999
happen and I don't think that is going

5912.28 --> 5916.199
to happen

5913.8 --> 5920.0
ever if that could have happened it

5916.199 --> 5922.08
would have happened 20 years ago and it

5920.0 --> 5925.159
didn't

5922.08 --> 5928.5599999999995
so I'm really happy with the way this is

5925.159 --> 5929.598999999999
set up it's it's I'm very happy with it

5928.56 --> 5932.599
I

5929.599 --> 5934.96
yeah I don't need need to like have way

5932.599 --> 5937.76
more subscribers and way more people in

5934.96 --> 5939.76
the chat a little bit more support would

5937.76 --> 5941.76
be nice but I

5939.76 --> 5944.599
mean

5941.76 --> 5946.56
yeah the way to achieve that is to have

5944.599 --> 5949.119000000001
the right people with me in the chat and

5946.56 --> 5951.639
then to like kind of make sure they do

5949.119 --> 5954.839999999999
well because if you do well then you'll

5951.639 --> 5956.08
be able to support me and everybody will

5954.84 --> 5960.04
have a

5956.08 --> 5963.04
win-win and that's kind of what I

5960.04 --> 5963.04
want

5973.239 --> 5978.159
martial arts class difficult

5978.639 --> 5984.08
yeah yeah if you have a large group

5981.08 --> 5985.719
you're just like trying to do it but

5984.08 --> 5987.44
nobody's going to like give you

5985.719 --> 5989.96
individual attention and basically

5987.44 --> 5992.5599999999995
correct you like how to do it cuz they

5989.96 --> 5995.28
never get to you yeah

5992.56 --> 5997.4800000000005
then it's you don't really learn all

5995.28 --> 5997.48
that

5999.48 --> 6003.5199999999995
much I've experienced similar issues

6002.32 --> 6007.199
when I was

6003.52 --> 6011.2390000000005
like doing my martial arts when I was

6007.199 --> 6011.239
younger because I did also do

6012.28 --> 6017.28
that um horseback riding and martial

6019.96 --> 6022.96
arts

6027.119 --> 6031.679
which by the way I think that was a

6028.76 --> 6032.84
really good choice because both are like

6031.679 --> 6036.56
very

6032.84 --> 6039.28
useful on the long run like there's

6036.56 --> 6042.92
anything yeah I mean horses are also

6039.28 --> 6045.5599999999995
like a symbol of status in ways and now

6042.92 --> 6045.56
I have that

6047.199 --> 6054.04
ability and the confidence too like if I

6050.32 --> 6058.32
really need it to like yep I'll just get

6054.04 --> 6058.32
on that horse and I'll know what to

6066.4 --> 6072.92
do yeah exactly debatable deed that's

6070.32 --> 6076.48
exactly what I don't want what you just

6072.92 --> 6079.28
described there dictators want yes men

6076.48 --> 6082.678999999999
and then when they crumble they all

6079.28 --> 6085.44
leave they're only being bound by the

6082.679 --> 6085.4400000000005
force of the

6109.84 --> 6112.84
dictator

6117.73 --> 6120.82
[Music]

6139.76 --> 6142.76
right

6151.239 --> 6159.04
I just got an ad for a zombie

6155.199 --> 6161.44
game ads are so weird sometimes like how

6159.04 --> 6161.44
they pick

6166.52 --> 6171.360000000001
it just hearing what the audience what I

6170.0 --> 6174.08
want from the audience I wonder what the

6171.36 --> 6177.92
rest of the audience wants from

6174.08 --> 6180.679
you well maybe they just are figuring

6177.92 --> 6182.679
that out it's like what are what is

6180.679 --> 6185.32
interesting about what I

6182.679 --> 6189.28
do

6185.32 --> 6191.04
and yeah is it worth to like interact

6189.28 --> 6194.28
with me in the chat over

6191.04 --> 6196.239
it or not maybe they just like to follow

6194.28 --> 6199.4
me and are

6196.239 --> 6201.28
like reading me like they would read a

6199.4 --> 6203.119
novel right about a character and

6201.28 --> 6207.92
they're just like yeah we just want to

6203.119 --> 6207.92
be updated as what's going on with Arwin

6211.36 --> 6218.48
right so that I mean I'm okay with that

6214.76 --> 6221.159000000001
I there I say I guess I might be kind of

6218.48 --> 6223.759999999999
interesting then again a guy who can

6221.159 --> 6225.96
literally do a stream every single day

6223.76 --> 6228.280000000001
and it just be that guy on camera for

6225.96 --> 6233.199
like a

6228.28 --> 6237.159
decade it's bound to get some

6233.199 --> 6240.159
following maybe I should ask

6237.159 --> 6240.159
them

6240.639 --> 6247.76
what

6242.84 --> 6247.76
okay right well I guess

6250.679 --> 6255.159
so what do you want from me borders

6258.32 --> 6266.719
Boy Wonder

6261.599 --> 6270.76
1882 chapters of the book of Arwin

6266.719 --> 6273.92
yeah well that's kind of like how I even

6270.76 --> 6278.159000000001
originally set out to do all

6273.92 --> 6282.2390000000005
this like it's a it's a live journal A

6278.159 --> 6286.119
Daily Journal where I'm very open I'm

6282.239 --> 6287.119
very into like the psychology of me and

6286.119 --> 6292.04
other

6287.119 --> 6295.119
people working on myself openly

6292.04 --> 6297.8
dealing with things openly also as an

6295.119 --> 6299.679
example to show like hey dude I had so

6297.8 --> 6302.719
many

6299.679 --> 6305.4
issues most of which were even hidden at

6302.719 --> 6307.719
the beginning I mean I didn't like come

6305.4 --> 6309.879999999999
in to early where show just starting out

6307.719 --> 6313.36
about my dark WF Visions or

6309.88 --> 6316.32

6313.36 --> 6318.88

that nobody knew I even had anything

6318.88 --> 6322.719
like that at all

6321.599 --> 6326.08
so it's

6322.719 --> 6330.04
like a work continual work in progress

6326.08 --> 6334.8
and I I feel I have made progress a

6330.04 --> 6336.5199999999995

of ability to size up People based on

7644.079 --> 7649.719
how they look and the the rest of the

7646.88 --> 7653.8
environment that you get to

7649.719 --> 7658.8
see I don't know

7653.8 --> 7658.8
just figuring out people skills I

7667.52 --> 7670.52
guess

7692.159 --> 7696.719
I'm getting kind of hungry I do but I

7694.679 --> 7699.92
mean to put an Illuminati C on it's kind

7696.719 --> 7701.2390000000005
of late I mean it's past

7699.92 --> 7704.2390000000005
past five

7701.239 --> 7704.239
already

7707.599 --> 7713.0
huh probably 300 later

7719.119 --> 7725.36
yeah my hair is always cold so that is

7723.36 --> 7727.4
all I

7725.36 --> 7730.44
what yeah what do you think that I'm

7727.4 --> 7733.04
going to be like a complete trash

7730.44 --> 7736.04
head I mean I'm not

7733.04 --> 7739.559
just I might not be a clean freak but

7736.04 --> 7742.0
I'm not like a like a real serious goofy

7739.559 --> 7749.8
hobo that just doesn't care about

7742.0 --> 7749.8
anything like I am I have some vanity a

7755.88 --> 7763.36
little do you still make

7759.96 --> 7766.52
sometimes uh well not

7763.36 --> 7768.558999999999
regularly but yeah periodically it's

7766.52 --> 7772.040000000001
like oh I really want that again and

7768.559 --> 7775.4800000000005
then I make that yeah but I mean it's

7772.04 --> 7777.679
not like a weekly dinner that I have or

7775.48 --> 7779.959999999999
[Music]

7777.679 --> 7781.559
anything I'm actually trying a whole

7779.96 --> 7786.4
bunch of new

7781.559 --> 7786.400000000001
stuff cuz uh I changed a

7787.32 --> 7796.159
lot I'm eating less which by the way is

7792.159 --> 7796.159
kind of funny because that saves me

7800.199 --> 7805.96
money make a big pot every other week oh

7806.36 --> 7809.48
okay I

7812.28 --> 7820.239
don't but there is a lot of meals in

7815.119 --> 7820.239
which I do add in chili

7820.96 --> 7828.119
like when I make hamburgers for example

7824.84 --> 7830.84
I do have like fresh Chili Pepper on

7828.119 --> 7834.119
it I like

7830.84 --> 7838.4800000000005
it four other of yeah well then it's

7834.119 --> 7841.199
much more Fe viable to to make that kind

7838.48 --> 7843.879999999999
of meal more regularly so that makes

7841.199 --> 7846.96
sense buckbuster like I'm basically

7843.88 --> 7849.079
cooking for one so for me when I do that

7846.96 --> 7853.639
that means that I have to then eat chili

7849.079 --> 7857.599
for half a week that's just how it

7853.639 --> 7859.88
is so I like really want I would really

7857.599 --> 7862.96
have to want to eat

7859.88 --> 7866.159000000001
chili because if I do that I have to

7862.96 --> 7867.88
then eat chili for a while so it's not

7866.159 --> 7870.119
something I want to do every week

7867.88 --> 7871.32
because then half my dinner would always

7870.119 --> 7874.92
be

7871.32 --> 7878.84
chilly freezes as well I don't freeze my

7874.92 --> 7881.36
food when I make it I eat it I don't

7878.84 --> 7884.679
freeze

7881.36 --> 7884.679
stuff I just

7885.0 --> 7893.679
don't I keep things in the freezer

7889.44 --> 7896.0
like uh potato

7893.679 --> 7899.4
chips or what do you call that french

7896.0 --> 7902.04
fries pre freezed I keep frozen stuff in

7899.4 --> 7904.44
there but I don't like oh I'm going to

7902.04 --> 7907.639
put this in a in a box and then freeze

7904.44 --> 7910.598999999999
it for later I don't do that I just

7907.639 --> 7911.96
finish it I eat it I make it and then I

7910.599 --> 7914.360000000001
eat it

7911.96 --> 7916.559
just because if you freeze it and then

7914.36 --> 7919.32
freeze it it's

7916.559 --> 7921.76
like it's going to be like half the

7919.32 --> 7924.679
nutritional value or something it's

7921.76 --> 7924.679
better to just eat

7929.4 --> 7936.598999999999
it what I'm ask why what do you mean

7937.079 --> 7940.079
why

7944.28 --> 7947.599
didn't I just answer

7949.159 --> 7955.16
that you're acting weird

7952.07 --> 7955.16
[Music]

7961.159 --> 7966.839999999999
man right borders boy yeah that's the

7964.32 --> 7968.799999999999
way I kind of do it too it's like I get

7966.84 --> 7970.599
an idea like oh I really want this and

7968.8 --> 7974.320000000001
then you're going to be eating it for 3

7970.599 --> 7974.32
or 4 days and that's just how it

7996.96 --> 7999.96
is

8020.079 --> 8023.079
what

8026.599 --> 8035.28
okay ACH je sandwich in ACR

8031.84 --> 8039.28
what how does that supposed to

8035.28 --> 8039.28
work that makes no sense to

8045.96 --> 8050.4
me also I effectively don't really eat

8048.96 --> 8054.52
cheese

8050.4 --> 8056.879999999999
anymore like it's so little that I've

8054.52 --> 8059.88
like forgot it even

8056.88 --> 8059.88
existed

8068.8 --> 8076.079000000001
G chili grill cheese sandwich yeah well

8072.0 --> 8079.159
good luck with that no I don't do that

8076.079 --> 8079.159
kind of food

8080.599 --> 8087.0
anymore I'm way too much of a food

8083.76 --> 8089.88
purist like that have bacon well I don't

8087.0 --> 8093.44
eat bacon

8089.88 --> 8096.119
I don't eat cheese I don't eat bacon so

8093.44 --> 8096.119
good luck with

8096.44 --> 8102.04
that anything else you want to add to

8099.159 --> 8102.04
that that I want

8107.36 --> 8113.36
eat the nutritional value goes down over

8110.599 --> 8115.719
the time it is frozen no it's not even

8113.36 --> 8118.799999999999
yeah no I don't eat fish either that's

8115.719 --> 8121.119
right uh what but I mean what it's not

8118.8 --> 8123.84
even like over time as it is frozen it's

8121.119 --> 8126.04
just if you freeze it it's like half the

8123.84 --> 8129.119000000001
nutritional value just goes away it's

8126.04 --> 8130.88
not like it keeps going down though

8129.119 --> 8134.0
unless you like leave it in the freezer

8130.88 --> 8137.28
for two years and then it's like all all

8134.0 --> 8140.36
the moist just gets extracted out of it

8137.28 --> 8140.36
do I eat chicken

8143.639 --> 8148.1
yeah my meats are mostly chicken and

8146.8 --> 8152.85
beef

8148.1 --> 8152.85
[Music]

8179.28 --> 8185.92
traditional Dutch dish that I

8182.88 --> 8188.079
like do I eat any red

8185.92 --> 8191.04
meat

8188.079 --> 8194.479
what what do you

8191.04 --> 8197.96
mean me red meat red meat is beef right

8194.479 --> 8197.96
beef is red meat isn't

8206.28 --> 8214.559000000001
it but as first traditional Dutch yeah I

8210.84 --> 8216.8
like like the classic setups I kind of

8214.559 --> 8218.358999999999
like rediscovered them because they were

8216.8 --> 8222.199999999999
a lot

8218.359 --> 8223.880000000001
cheaper so it's like mashed potatoes

8222.2 --> 8229.2
with

8223.88 --> 8230.759999999998
like gravy that's basically out of a

8229.2 --> 8233.92
beef

8230.76 --> 8237.359
sausage that was like baked in butter a

8233.92 --> 8239.28
lot of gravy comes out of that right

8237.359 --> 8241.76
with red

8239.28 --> 8244.24
beets it that is kind of one of my

8241.76 --> 8246.960000000001
favorite meals that really like fills

8244.24 --> 8252.599
you up in a good way so that really

8246.96 --> 8252.598999999998
works for me and it is kind of classic

8256.28 --> 8259.28
Dutch

8265.2 --> 8269.599
uh also

8274.319 --> 8281.84
Kale like there's a it would roughly

8278.12 --> 8284.599
translate into English like Farmers kale

8281.84 --> 8286.439
with sausage like that's like literally

8284.599 --> 8288.399
what it's called it's a very yeah you

8286.439 --> 8290.639000000001
just have mashed potatoes again we love

8288.399 --> 8294.199999999999
our mashed potatoes

8290.639 --> 8296.199999999999
here but with kale through

8294.2 --> 8298.639000000001
it and some

8296.2 --> 8301.08
butter and then you add a sausage and

8298.639 --> 8302.96
that's it that's also classic Dutch I

8301.08 --> 8305.0
kind of like that I don't even I don't

8302.96 --> 8309.479
eat that a lot not as much as like with

8305.0 --> 8309.479
the red beads but I also do like

8311.76 --> 8318.0
that like chicken

8315.0 --> 8322.16
paprikash uh

8318.0 --> 8322.16
maybe I'm not a big fan of

8322.8 --> 8330.438999999998
paprika including like the dried dried

8327.84 --> 8330.439
powder

8331.08 --> 8336.84
stuff I think I might be like not

8333.96 --> 8339.96
allergic to it but it's like I have a

8336.84 --> 8339.960000000001
weird response to

8340.0 --> 8345.679
it I noticed that like during my

8342.92 --> 8347.719000000001
teens and everybody love paprika there

8345.679 --> 8349.04
but I just kind of like I don't buy it

8347.719 --> 8352.518999999998
ever

8349.04 --> 8355.319000000001
now like if it's in a salad I might like

8352.519 --> 8360.16
take a bite from it like just to try it

8355.319 --> 8360.16
out again but it's not my steady

8362.439 --> 8368.399
diet kill chips Garden

8366.76 --> 8371.2
okay

8368.399 --> 8373.479
what how do you make chips from that

8371.2 --> 8373.479000000001
that's

8386.439 --> 8389.439
weird

8392.479 --> 8400.438999999998
TOS let see K in your salad what but you

8396.92 --> 8400.439
shouldn't eat kale raw

8408.84 --> 8413.24
though just covering all the oil bacon

8411.76 --> 8416.359
in the oven and dough

8413.24 --> 8419.28
crisp huh

8416.359 --> 8422.399000000001
okay

8419.28 --> 8424.880000000001
there's a lot of Papa it yeah it's not

8422.399 --> 8424.88
my thing

8426.28 --> 8432.0
then I mean it's not like I hate paprika

8429.84 --> 8434.52
or I'm allergic for it it's just that

8432.0 --> 8438.319
I'm kind of like

8434.52 --> 8438.319000000001
n not really my

8445.439 --> 8451.12
thing okay h

8449.04 --> 8454.28
similar to kill and mesh okay that's

8451.12 --> 8457.319000000001
interesting never heard of that phrase

8454.28 --> 8460.319000000001
before don't recognize

8457.319 --> 8461.88
that got to go okay box out Buster yeah

8460.319 --> 8465.319
you take care too

8461.88 --> 8465.319
and take it

8475.6 --> 8483.0
easy wow been going now over 3 hours

8479.08 --> 8485.12
again in total including the first part

8483.0 --> 8486.88
of the show that was cut off after less

8485.12 --> 8489.399000000001
than an hour because of my internet

8486.88 --> 8489.399
breaking

8491.64 --> 8498.56
down hope you're all still enjoying the

8494.2 --> 8498.560000000001
show we're now in the food

8506.24 --> 8509.24
phase

8525.84 --> 8533.24
right but I mean it's funny because like

8529.68 --> 8535.28
paprika and red chili pepper are very

8533.24 --> 8538.92
similar except red chili pepper is

8535.28 --> 8540.880000000001
really hot and

8538.92 --> 8543.16
I just don't really like paprika anymore

8540.88 --> 8545.8
but I really do like red chili pepper

8543.16 --> 8549.28
and I eat lots of it and I know it's

8545.8 --> 8552.56
very healthy it works very well for

8549.28 --> 8554.880000000001
me so it's kind of funny that when I was

8552.56 --> 8556.68
younger like everybody in the family

8554.88 --> 8558.319
like really loved paprika we would

8556.68 --> 8559.880000000001
always like have some kind of salad and

8558.319 --> 8563.399
always paprika with

8559.88 --> 8565.96
it but I just kind of like

8563.399 --> 8567.76
stopped but now it's like chili pepper

8565.96 --> 8569.96
it's all about the chili pepper I love

8567.76 --> 8569.960000000001
that

8570.12 --> 8577.560000000001
stuff and I mean organic chili pepper is

8573.479 --> 8580.88
just really great compared to regular

8577.56 --> 8580.88
it's it's just

8593.68 --> 8600.439
great biscus cix what

8597.68 --> 8603.76
what is that letter s what are you

8600.439 --> 8607.800000000001
talking about more Chili Peppers

8603.76 --> 8611.399
faks two very good for you oh

8607.8 --> 8613.599999999999
interesting yeah now I like them fresh

8611.399 --> 8615.119999999999
especially where you literally just half

8613.6 --> 8618.04
the chili pepper as if they were just

8615.12 --> 8620.319000000001
cut and then you cut them open and get

8618.04 --> 8624.68
the seeds

8620.319 --> 8629.08
out and then yeah put it on a hamburger

8624.68 --> 8629.08
in like little strips

8630.279 --> 8636.880000000001
or yeah in other like in some other

8634.0 --> 8640.76
meal that is need spiciness and in

8636.88 --> 8643.039999999999
little blocks like that's just great I

8640.76 --> 8643.04

8730.6 --> 8736.880000000001

right

8797.88 --> 8804.08
whatever it is they put in organic food

8800.84 --> 8805.8
make it organic Le that what what are

8804.08 --> 8808.8
you talking about Steve

8805.8 --> 8808.8
Bronson

8819.96 --> 8826.72
what the hell is a length way borders

8823.399 --> 8829.24
boy never heard of that but I mean Chile

8826.72 --> 8833.88
in curry yeah that makes sense to

8829.24 --> 8837.6
me but to be fair I I don't make curry I

8833.88 --> 8840.92
don't do it like that I like to apply

8837.6 --> 8840.92
those herbs in different

8841.84 --> 8847.72
ways prefer non-organic

8845.56 --> 8850.319
what

8847.72 --> 8852.88
okay I still don't know exactly what

8850.319 --> 8854.92
you're talking about but I mean yeah

8852.88 --> 8858.358999999999
there dude eating

8854.92 --> 8860.359
organic it's not like oh you eat regular

8858.359 --> 8862.2
stuff and then you start eating organic

8860.359 --> 8862.960000000001
and it's like oh it's immediately better

8862.2 --> 8867.479000000001
no

8862.96 --> 8870.679999999998
dude you have to detox first and it's

8867.479 --> 8873.319
not a joke yeah when I started eating

8870.68 --> 8876.960000000001
organic it was kind of weird to me too

8873.319 --> 8879.64
it was like tastes weird yeah but guess

8876.96 --> 8883.08
what if you like truly abandon the

8879.64 --> 8886.519999999999
regular stuff then after a while it's

8883.08 --> 8890.2
like your entire sensory

8886.52 --> 8893.12
system it just completely changes and

8890.2 --> 8896.359
then you realize like

8893.12 --> 8899.279
whoo like eat organic for a while and

8896.359 --> 8902.04
then like try one of the regular things

8899.279 --> 8904.0
just a bite dude you like spit it out

8902.04 --> 8907.080000000002
because now you can

8904.0 --> 8910.24
taste the toxicity in it that you

8907.08 --> 8911.52
literally cannot taste if you're used to

8910.24 --> 8915.039999999999
it all your

8911.52 --> 8917.399000000001
life that's real I went through that in

8915.04 --> 8919.880000000001
like between

8917.399 --> 8922.24
2006 and

8919.88 --> 8927.64
2010 when it was like hardcore

8922.24 --> 8931.0
transitioning with food to organic only

8927.64 --> 8934.199999999999
like at first you don't notice

8931.0 --> 8935.72
it you're like this just ch tastes

8934.2 --> 8938.960000000001
different I don't

8935.72 --> 8942.84
know but as you have to like quit the

8938.96 --> 8944.88
regular food and then go organic instead

8942.84 --> 8947.12
and then eventually you'll like go

8944.88 --> 8950.16
through a transformation like a detox

8947.12 --> 8952.84
and you'll like really really notice the

8950.16 --> 8954.2
difference then yeah but at first that

8952.84 --> 8956.64
doesn't

8954.2 --> 8958.800000000001
happen at first it just feels like h

8956.64 --> 8960.439
this is weird and different I don't

8958.8 --> 8962.199999999999
really it doesn't really feel that much

8960.439 --> 8964.56
better and that's why a lot of people

8962.2 --> 8967.84
are like I don't believe in organic it's

8964.56 --> 8970.96
a scam dude I've had so many people tell

8967.84 --> 8973.84
me that what you eat organic only that's

8970.96 --> 8975.8
a scam like yeah there's a lot of people

8973.84 --> 8977.479
that told me that and then they told me

8975.8 --> 8979.759999999998
like yeah we tried to eat organic I

8977.479 --> 8982.438999999998
didn't like it it was just weird like

8979.76 --> 8986.08
yeah yeah I know because you have to

8982.439 --> 8988.76
like actually stop eating regular food

8986.08 --> 8990.24
and then then you really start to notice

8988.76 --> 8992.800000000001
the

8990.24 --> 8994.279
difference what is the exact ingredient

8992.8 --> 8996.56
that makes something

8994.279 --> 9000.52
organic not

8996.56 --> 9003.84
pesticide not pesticide more natural

9000.52 --> 9007.84
Earthly nutrition within the

9003.84 --> 9011.8
plants yeah not having

9007.84 --> 9015.479
bioaccumulative toxic poison in the fats

9011.8 --> 9018.278999999999
of the of the meat yeah that's what

9015.479 --> 9021.8
makes it organic

9018.279 --> 9024.84
yeah organisms no it's the lack of

9021.8 --> 9027.519999999999
pesticide it's the more intact natural

9024.84 --> 9029.8
nutrition that Still Remains within the

9027.52 --> 9033.560000000001
food product

9029.8 --> 9033.56
yeah that's the

9036.55 --> 9039.759999999998
[Music]

9045.439 --> 9049.880000000001
difference

9048.16 --> 9053.279
in the Farmers Market okay that's fine

9049.88 --> 9053.278999999999
flatter stage don't

9057.359 --> 9062.52
worry

9059.52 --> 9062.52
organms

9070.72 --> 9076.039999999999
what yeah waterers boy but you can

9073.52 --> 9078.84
really only tell the difference once you

9076.04 --> 9080.399000000001
stop stop eating the regular stuff maybe

9078.84 --> 9083.479
you don't remember that or maybe you

9080.399 --> 9085.64
were like you grew up eating organic I

9083.479 --> 9088.24
did not grow up eating organic I had to

9085.64 --> 9090.68
start doing

9088.24 --> 9093.68
it at

9090.68 --> 9098.64
26 and at first dude back then I was

9093.68 --> 9102.479000000001
like still eating like La chips with all

9098.64 --> 9104.039999999999
the MSG and all that crap and I was like

9102.479 --> 9106.399
I don't see the problem like yeah it

9104.04 --> 9108.92
doesn't really feel that healthy like I

9106.399 --> 9111.0
might be worried for the long run that's

9108.92 --> 9113.6
kind of why I

9111.0 --> 9118.479
started and at first it was like this

9113.6 --> 9120.04
organic stuff is weird I don't know like

9118.479 --> 9122.319
like I didn't really want to like it

9120.04 --> 9123.880000000001
felt protest but then it's like no I I

9122.319 --> 9126.68
really want to be healthy I'm going to

9123.88 --> 9128.399
do it like I'm going to like I'll take

9126.68 --> 9129.68
that challenge of the wheel and I'm

9128.399 --> 9132.519999999999
going to do it I'm going to keep

9129.68 --> 9134.52
sticking to that and then eventually

9132.52 --> 9137.68
it's like

9134.52 --> 9140.16
who like after just a few weeks like wow

9137.68 --> 9142.68
it it feels different there I feel

9140.16 --> 9145.24
different it's interesting it's more

9142.68 --> 9149.56
clear I feel less

9145.24 --> 9152.6
burdened and then like I just really

9149.56 --> 9155.68
started to enjoy the taste of organic

9152.6 --> 9158.319
food like that came after didn't start

9155.68 --> 9160.479000000001
out with that it's not like oh I oh some

9158.319 --> 9162.6
organic food oh take a bite and then oh

9160.479 --> 9164.16
my God it's so much better no you have

9162.6 --> 9168.08
to detox

9164.16 --> 9170.279
first and then it'll like like then

9168.08 --> 9173.24
you'll be unburdened and then you can

9170.279 --> 9175.399000000001
truly like as who said it in there in

9173.24 --> 9178.439
the chat you can just have the regular

9175.399 --> 9182.24
tomato and the organic tomato take a

9178.439 --> 9184.279
bite bite taste it spit out or whatever

9182.24 --> 9185.16
take a bite of the other and then you

9184.279 --> 9189.479000000001
really

9185.16 --> 9192.84
notice but if you're used to regular

9189.479 --> 9195.56
food you don't notice that and that's

9192.84 --> 9197.56
why a lot of people say organic food is

9195.56 --> 9200.199999999999
a scam

9197.56 --> 9203.16
because they never have the willpower to

9200.2 --> 9205.359
actually stop eating the the the normal

9203.16 --> 9208.359
stuff

9205.359 --> 9208.359
yeah

9214.319 --> 9219.84
so okay Richard yeah sure why not hey

9218.0 --> 9222.0
metal slugs cockail by the way good to

9219.84 --> 9222.0
see

9222.04 --> 9229.04
you oh my I can detect the chemical off

9225.6 --> 9231.800000000001
flavor processed foods yeah well

9229.04 --> 9234.560000000001
nonorganic processed foods are like the

9231.8 --> 9235.399
worst ever they put weird chemical [ __ ]

9234.56 --> 9237.84
in

9235.399 --> 9240.119999999999
that and that's everywhere in the world

9237.84 --> 9242.56
I mean in America I can barely imagine

9240.12 --> 9244.479000000001
how bad it would be there since they

9242.56 --> 9248.439
allow all kinds of chemicals that are

9244.479 --> 9252.8
completely forbidden here in in

9248.439 --> 9258.08
Europe so you should be able to to know

9252.8 --> 9258.08
the difference GMO what is that what

9259.04 --> 9266.399000000001
uh what Steve Bronson how old are

9263.88 --> 9268.319
you how the hell could you not know what

9266.399 --> 9272.439
GMO

9268.319 --> 9272.439
is that's

9273.76 --> 9283.439
weird why for what big

9278.439 --> 9283.439
Agra is GMO poisonous dead

9285.08 --> 9288.08
yeah

9298.24 --> 9306.279
like avoid anything GMO in food like

9302.2 --> 9306.279
your life depends on it because it

9309.359 --> 9318.04
will like GMO is like almost entirely

9314.84 --> 9323.2
forbidden in Europe for a good reason I

9318.04 --> 9325.800000000001
was there doing protest marches against

9323.2 --> 9328.84
GMO it's like

9325.8 --> 9332.039999999999
no that stuff is pure

9328.84 --> 9336.04
evil and the companies that have in

9332.04 --> 9338.359
tried to introduce it were literally

9336.04 --> 9341.160000000002
known yeah yeah this is not me

9338.359 --> 9346.16
exaggerating they were known as the most

9341.16 --> 9348.319
evil Corporation in the world okay they

9346.16 --> 9350.68
might have been outdone by now by like

9348.319 --> 9352.68
the pharmaceutical companies or whatever

9350.68 --> 9356.279
but that's how they were

9352.68 --> 9360.68
known in the 90s officially like

9356.279 --> 9365.439
everybody agreed to that the most evil

9360.68 --> 9368.68
companies in the world were like the GMO

9365.439 --> 9371.359
companies yeah that's for a

9368.68 --> 9373.439
reason not young just never paid

9371.359 --> 9374.439
attention to any of this food stuff okay

9373.439 --> 9377.64
Steve

9374.439 --> 9380.359
Ronson fair enough

9377.64 --> 9383.56
Welcome to the Real

9380.359 --> 9386.2
World absorb this information because

9383.56 --> 9388.92
your life will literally depend on it

9386.2 --> 9391.0
yeah people that just don't know the

9388.92 --> 9393.08
difference between GMO and just eat

9391.0 --> 9396.88
anything that comes in their

9393.08 --> 9400.039999999999
path uh now I'm not

9396.88 --> 9402.72
qualified reference to the title but I

9400.04 --> 9405.439
am effective I can tell you I can tell

9402.72 --> 9407.84
you on an intuition and there might be

9405.439 --> 9409.960000000001
statistics s that backet people that

9407.84 --> 9412.08
just casually eat GMO stuff and all that

9409.96 --> 9414.839999999998
and not realize it they're going to have

9412.08 --> 9418.439
a shorter lifespan than people that are

9414.84 --> 9418.439
very meticulous to avoid

9419.88 --> 9427.08
it because that stuff is so burdensome

9423.88 --> 9429.72
it will agid you and it will Aid your

9427.08 --> 9433.24
organs and it's kind of tough to undo

9429.72 --> 9436.56
that damage on the long run it's not

9433.24 --> 9440.56
impossible but it's tough so yeah Steve

9436.56 --> 9442.519999999999
Bronson I would go organic But realize

9440.56 --> 9444.24
it's a challenge it's kind of tough

9442.52 --> 9447.319000000001
depending on the region where you live

9444.24 --> 9452.359
at it's

9447.319 --> 9453.8
tough like organic you can't like it's

9452.359 --> 9455.68
not like you're going to walk in every

9453.8 --> 9457.278999999999
store and find organic you see you're

9455.68 --> 9458.76
going to have to find your sources

9457.279 --> 9461.640000000001
you're going to have to like be more

9458.76 --> 9464.0
careful where you buy your

9461.64 --> 9466.399
food and you're going to have to read

9464.0 --> 9471.08
labels you're going to have to also

9466.399 --> 9474.0
beside just organic know about sub like

9471.08 --> 9477.52
about things that are put in the food

9474.0 --> 9481.04
you're going to have to learn about MSG

9477.52 --> 9483.24
mono sodium glutamate which is a flavor

9481.04 --> 9484.92
enhancer that's actually quite toxic

9483.24 --> 9488.72
you're going to have to know

9484.92 --> 9488.72
about uh what are they called

9489.279 --> 9496.2
again aspartame and aspartame adjacent

9493.56 --> 9501.278999999999
chemicals which are sugar replac ments

9496.2 --> 9505.479000000001
that are incredibly toxic like dude just

9501.279 --> 9508.6
take the sugar version never ever take

9505.479 --> 9512.399
like that kind of sugar replacement it's

9508.6 --> 9514.720000000001
lethal it like aspartame and I learned

9512.399 --> 9518.319
this like in 2006 I know it by heart

9514.72 --> 9521.16
aspan in your liver breaks down to

9518.319 --> 9524.278999999999
methal alcohol that makes you blind over

9521.16 --> 9528.24
time and formel

9524.279 --> 9530.6
theide which is the toxin that they that

9528.24 --> 9533.359
like at the

9530.6 --> 9537.68
funeral like the funeral person pumps

9533.359 --> 9540.52
into a dead body to to prevent the Decay

9537.68 --> 9544.04
yeah that's what's released in your

9540.52 --> 9547.12
liver when you consume aspartame and

9544.04 --> 9549.960000000001
aspartame adjacent sugar

9547.12 --> 9551.84
Replacements

9549.96 --> 9555.08
yeah

9551.84 --> 9556.960000000001
so food know what you're eating know

9555.08 --> 9558.399
what you're drinking don't just trust

9556.96 --> 9563.08
the industry like oh we're going to

9558.399 --> 9564.92
replace this with this dude yeah

9563.08 --> 9567.8
also

9564.92 --> 9572.319
avoid floridated

9567.8 --> 9575.24
water like it's the plague because it is

9572.319 --> 9577.08
and if all possible try to realize that

9575.24 --> 9579.6
about the toothpaste yeah floridated

9577.08 --> 9582.319
toothpaste is not good for

9579.6 --> 9585.08
you it's not even fluoride yeah you

9582.319 --> 9586.278999999999
might think oh but calcium fluoride is

9585.08 --> 9588.0
beneficial

9586.279 --> 9593.279
substance yeah that's not what that is

9588.0 --> 9597.12
though it's sodium fluide is a ccho

9593.279 --> 9600.2
phrase for what is kind of like

9597.12 --> 9603.12
hydr floristic

9600.2 --> 9607.240000000002
acid which is like a

9603.12 --> 9610.68
toxic poison it's an industrial toxic

9607.24 --> 9613.56
poison that's like a side toxin that

9610.68 --> 9618.04
just happens in certain industries and

9613.56 --> 9620.319
they yeah it's bad for you really bad

9618.04 --> 9624.04
calcifies your pineal gland giv you like

9620.319 --> 9627.119999999999
bone growing problems but it especially

9624.04 --> 9629.800000000001
it numbs the mind and it takes away your

9627.12 --> 9631.68
psychic senses that's what happens when

9629.8 --> 9634.16
you calcify your pineal gland it takes

9631.68 --> 9637.92
away your sensibility and it's been

9634.16 --> 9642.399
actively used in freaking concentration

9637.92 --> 9645.04
camps for that purpose yeah so avoid all

9642.399 --> 9646.16
those things love McDonald's well then

9645.04 --> 9650.960000000001
you're scre

9646.16 --> 9650.96
screwed you're screwed

9651.56 --> 9659.479
yeah just makes you want more yeah yeah

9656.12 --> 9659.479000000001
uh you're not going to grow

9659.64 --> 9667.96
old yeah McDonalds is like on record

9664.04 --> 9671.439
like the most toxic food that pretty

9667.96 --> 9674.519999999999
much exists yeah there was a documentary

9671.439 --> 9677.24
in the 9s where they tested all kinds of

9674.52 --> 9680.720000000001
fast food rest resturants and their

9677.24 --> 9685.479
products and guess what McDonald french

9680.72 --> 9685.479
fries are literally IND

9685.6 --> 9690.76
digestible you understand what that

9687.96 --> 9695.679999999998
means that means that if you leave them

9690.76 --> 9698.08
in a box over time like any food will

9695.68 --> 9699.24
start to rot it will start the fungus

9698.08 --> 9702.68
right and then it will just be

9699.24 --> 9706.64
completely gone like nature will eat it

9702.68 --> 9711.0
yeah except for McDonald's french fries

9706.64 --> 9713.84
yeah that stuff is so toxic you need to

9711.0 --> 9715.319
stop it's lethal you're not going to

9713.84 --> 9719.0
grow old with

9715.319 --> 9721.6
that an organic they want they want do

9821.56 --> 9825.84
insane also I'm pretty sure that you're

9824.279 --> 9828.6

9849.279 --> 9854.0
a former roommate years ago that also

9851.439 --> 9859.84

9854.0 --> 9863.68
a nightmare it stank so bad

9859.84 --> 9866.24

9875.92 --> 9880.399
movie it's a documentary from the 90s

9878.56 --> 9883.399
super sized

9880.399 --> 9886.16
me somebody just only eating McDonald's

9883.399 --> 9889.8
and they also did that like

9886.16 --> 9891.72
just put it in a box and let it just sit

9889.8 --> 9893.759999999998
there over time and everything would

9891.72 --> 9895.76
basically digest except McDonald's

9893.76 --> 9898.439
french fries which looked

9895.76 --> 9901.56
identical to when they were put in the

9898.439 --> 9904.08
box which is insane like surreal people

9901.56 --> 9905.72
didn't even believe that was real it's

9904.08 --> 9909.24
like that's

9905.72 --> 9913.039999999999
crazy how the hell isn't it digesting by

9909.24 --> 9913.039999999999
the bacteria and fungus that's just

9914.08 --> 9919.96
insane

man and I mean that's like even the

9966.319 --> 9970.88
Dutch version I like I can't even

9968.84 --> 9973.8
imagine what they're like in the United

9970.88 --> 9975.839999999998
States themselves that must be worse I I

9973.8 --> 9977.438999999998
don't even want to

9975.84 --> 9981.880000000001
think about

9977.439 --> 9981.880000000001
it it's worse than with car

9986.399 --> 9991.88
yeah but I still remember what it smells

9989.04 --> 9999.04
like and it just smells

9991.88 --> 9999.039999999999

10010.96 --> 10017.759999999998
either they're not going to be great but

10014.439 --> 10017.76
not like

10022.84 --> 10028.56
horrifying flame

10025.0 --> 10028.56
chart all righty

10029.12 --> 10036.92
then what you

10032.6 --> 10036.92
ah what the hell

10037.64 --> 10041.56
dude but all weird all kinds of weird

10039.319 --> 10045.519999999999
things have been found there but also in

10041.56 --> 10045.519999999999
other fast food stuff things

10046.439 --> 10051.359
like chicken nuggets that have something

10049.64 --> 10053.68
else in them I'm not like I'm not going

10051.359 --> 10057.24
to make claims about it I don't want to

10053.68 --> 10059.04
wrongfully accuse anything just I'm not

10057.24 --> 10061.76
going to eat there anymore if you don't

10059.04 --> 10061.76
mind ever

10062.16 --> 10069.72
again besides like can try Fried Chicken

10066.76 --> 10075.24
like I can just do that organic

10069.72 --> 10075.24
myself like how about organic

10075.88 --> 10085.08
chicken like you can just get that oh

10080.24 --> 10086.439
it's more expensive yeah and way better

10085.08 --> 10088.92
actually

10086.439 --> 10091.359
nutritious why would they lie oh yeah

10088.92 --> 10091.359
why would

10093.8 --> 10096.8
they

10105.479 --> 10110.16
do they also say that their potato chips

10107.92 --> 10112.88
are 100%

10110.16 --> 10117.399
potato because as far as I know potatoes

10112.88 --> 10117.399
actually do like degenerate over

10117.88 --> 10122.358999999999
time so

10123.24 --> 10128.96
yeah they have no no reason to lie what

10126.279 --> 10128.960000000001
are you talking

10130.68 --> 10138.84
about St Bronson are you trolling

10134.84 --> 10141.319
us are you trolling us starting to feel

10138.84 --> 10141.319

10158.239 --> 10165.16
flatter Sage but hey if you like that

10162.56 --> 10165.16
that's just

10167.279 --> 10173.239
fine and yes I'm calling them micro WIS

10170.279 --> 10173.239

10222.239 --> 10227.199999999999
yeah yeah I know that pleas I know it's

10224.52 --> 10228.76
it's like a health food thing I'm just

10227.2 --> 10233.16
not really into

10228.76 --> 10233.16
it I have nothing against it

10243.64 --> 10249.88
though

10245.8 --> 10249.88
the pink slime video won you

10252.72 --> 10261.519999999999
over

10255.04 --> 10261.52
creepy oh that stuff is so so [ __ ]

10263.399 --> 10268.319
creepy nights are getting lighter yeah I

10265.68 --> 10271.16
know yeah it is lighter indeed I mean

10268.319 --> 10273.56
hey the winter is almost over right

10271.16 --> 10276.56
we're in March

10273.56 --> 10276.56
now

10278.279 --> 10284.239
when you say gamma

10281.399 --> 10286.68
what talk about the Brave New World no

10284.239 --> 10288.92
that has nothing to do with that when I

10286.68 --> 10292.52
say gamma that's a reference to the

10288.92 --> 10296.2
social sexual hierarchy system of Vox

10292.52 --> 10298.52
day who pretty much invented it and like

10296.2 --> 10301.08
Owen wielded that a lot and I kind of

10298.52 --> 10301.08
adopted

10303.279 --> 10308.0
it it's a personality

10316.6 --> 10320.6
type it's not a reference to the Brave

10319.439 --> 10324.2
New

10320.6 --> 10326.800000000001
World uh breed

10324.2 --> 10332.359
classification it's different they also

10326.8 --> 10336.479
had like an alpha beta gamma all that

10332.359 --> 10336.479000000001
but that's something else

10336.88 --> 10345.56
personality of the what no

10341.319 --> 10345.56
what the hell do that have to do with

10356.92 --> 10363.399
anything American Burger chin yeah I

10359.479 --> 10363.399
know that metal slugs cail I

10363.439 --> 10366.439
know

10367.04 --> 10372.84
right es like especially if it's like a

10370.359 --> 10372.84
very

10374.76 --> 10380.84
local Burger Joint like the chains the

10378.6 --> 10383.68
bigger the chain the more dubious it

10380.84 --> 10385.72
gets right but if it's like like a

10383.68 --> 10388.84
restaurant that's great that doesn't

10385.72 --> 10390.278999999999
have to be bad at all then there's even

10388.84 --> 10392.84
better when there's a restaurant that

10390.279 --> 10394.720000000001
literally has their own garden from

10392.84 --> 10396.64
which they get the thing so so they

10394.72 --> 10399.72
literally grow it themselves like those

10396.64 --> 10399.72
are actually really

10399.88 --> 10407.679999999998
great often a bit pricey but worth

10403.96 --> 10412.8
it so yeah definitely recommend

10407.68 --> 10415.239
that right smaller local Moms and Pops

10412.8 --> 10416.8
as they call that I think better it's

10415.239 --> 10419.84
always better like it's going to be

10416.8 --> 10421.599999999999
better quality it might be a little bit

10419.84 --> 10423.359
less cheap but it's just going to be way

10421.6 --> 10425.470000000001
better quality

10423.359 --> 10432.579
overall

10425.47 --> 10432.579
[Music]

10444.6 --> 10449.56
GMA R what yeah in science fiction

10453.279 --> 10456.279
yeah

10463.0 --> 10468.84
yeah Steve Bronson that's right in Brave

10465.68 --> 10471.0
New World the gamas were the

10468.84 --> 10474.279
underclass had like the alpha the

10471.0 --> 10477.84
managing class the beta that were like

10474.279 --> 10480.239
the uh engineering class I think

10477.84 --> 10482.92
something like that and the gamas were

10480.239 --> 10484.68
kind of like the lower tier slave class

10482.92 --> 10486.2
and they were also physically smaller

10484.68 --> 10489.2
and all

10486.2 --> 10489.2
that

10489.56 --> 10495.039999999999
yeah oh by the way I'm doing this by

10491.72 --> 10497.438999999998
memory it's like I read that book 30

10495.04 --> 10499.960000000001
years ago was quite a while

10497.439 --> 10502.800000000001
ago

10499.96 --> 10503.96
so are you going to put organic yeah I

10502.8 --> 10507.239
thought of

10503.96 --> 10509.88
that I I thought of

10507.239 --> 10511.399
that it's a good point we been talking

10509.88 --> 10513.039999999999
about food for quite a while so I'm

10511.399 --> 10516.199999999999
going to add that to the titles good

10513.04 --> 10516.2
thanks for reminding me

10518.62 --> 10521.709

10525.49 --> 10528.58

10560.24 --> 10563.49
[Music]

10563.68 --> 10568.720000000001
yes all right so now it's unqualified

10566.439 --> 10572.720000000001
but effective and the radical advantages

10568.72 --> 10572.72
of an organic diet

10573.12 --> 10576.12
yeah

10578.52 --> 10583.359
today's been a good show very happy with

10581.16 --> 10586.88
[Music]

10583.359 --> 10586.880000000001
it and I'm kind of

10588.279 --> 10593.399000000001
hungry it's been a total of four hours

10603.08 --> 10606.08
now

10619.0 --> 10623.56
a source local it again okay metal slugs

10621.92 --> 10628.239
that sounds

10623.56 --> 10630.64
good I mean if you can like have a chain

10628.239 --> 10634.319
that just makes it local wherever they

10630.64 --> 10635.92
are that's that's a good concept it's it

10634.319 --> 10637.399
seems a little bit difficult because

10635.92 --> 10640.279
it's going to be like different

10637.399 --> 10642.84
everywhere then right that's the that's

10640.279 --> 10645.279
the downside of it that's this whole

10642.84 --> 10648.279
marketing thing it's like if you just

10645.279 --> 10650.92
have a universal standard then people

10648.279 --> 10653.04
will come for that it's exactly how they

10650.92 --> 10655.84
anticipate wherever they are so it's

10653.04 --> 10658.960000000001
like the McDonald's it's disgusting but

10655.84 --> 10661.239
it's like exactly the same everywhere

10658.96 --> 10663.199999999999
and it's like it all lasts forever so

10661.239 --> 10664.88
you can just have this stock keep it

10663.2 --> 10666.6
cheap and every body that will get there

10664.88 --> 10669.56
will know exactly what they're going to

10666.6 --> 10672.6
get right if you like have everything

10669.56 --> 10676.08
sourced local you don't have that effect

10672.6 --> 10680.2
so it's like oh I went to this chain

10676.08 --> 10683.52
over there in that uh State and it was

10680.2 --> 10685.52
pretty good but then I went like South

10683.52 --> 10688.08
to the same chain and it's like w this

10685.52 --> 10691.08
is tastes completely different why would

10688.08 --> 10692.6
that be well because it's grown

10691.08 --> 10694.96
differently it's like different

10692.6 --> 10697.720000000001
conditions there so it's like

10694.96 --> 10700.399
right that that's what happens then so

10697.72 --> 10704.119999999999
there is like you'd have to like you

10700.399 --> 10708.439
would be pulling in customers that like

10704.12 --> 10710.560000000001
are more prioritizing their health like

10708.439 --> 10713.359
that it has to be healthy then that it

10710.56 --> 10715.76
has to be exactly tasting that one way

10713.359 --> 10718.800000000001
right so you basically direct yourself

10715.76 --> 10721.6
to another customer base like

10718.8 --> 10724.84
that the chain becomes more Health

10721.6 --> 10726.76
oriented instead of just like easy lazy

10724.84 --> 10729.359
consumer oriented like

10726.76 --> 10730.279
McDonald's cuz that's what it is that's

10729.359 --> 10733.880000000001
how that

10730.279 --> 10733.880000000001
works but sounds

10734.479 --> 10741.039999999999
cool Five Guys I've never heard of that

10737.76 --> 10745.92
but if they do that that's pretty

10741.04 --> 10748.560000000001
cool like I I would try that out maybe

10745.92 --> 10752.16
although my standards are really like I

10748.56 --> 10755.56
just I it has to be organic only it just

10752.16 --> 10758.68
has to that's

10755.56 --> 10761.92
it so if it's not that then it could be

10758.68 --> 10765.0
pretty cool I'm still not going to eat

10761.92 --> 10768.0
there starving to instant mashed

10765.0 --> 10770.2
potatoes processed mushy peas and some

10768.0 --> 10774.72
frozen sausage

10770.2 --> 10774.720000000001
okay all right good luck with

10782.84 --> 10785.84
that

10799.359 --> 10803.84
oh only

10801.16 --> 10806.08
joking okay

10803.84 --> 10808.439
fine right I think I'm going to round

10806.08 --> 10808.439
out

10808.52 --> 10813.560000000001
though it's been

10811.76 --> 10815.68
interesting hope you all enjoyed the

10813.56 --> 10818.08
show

10815.68 --> 10820.960000000001
like this particular one video has

10818.08 --> 10825.0
lasted now over 3 hours if you can Im so

10820.96 --> 10825.0
I've done over four hours of

10832.6 --> 10842.239
stream you know a Dutch guy called yoka

10838.359 --> 10845.12
yeah well that's how it might that would

10842.239 --> 10847.16
be pronounced yo

10845.12 --> 10849.439
and that is a Dutch name but it is

10847.16 --> 10853.56
actually kind of a female name so that's

10849.439 --> 10857.6
weird I never met a guy called yoka but

10853.56 --> 10860.039999999999
yoka is a very oldfashioned like earlier

10857.6 --> 10863.52
20th century type

10860.04 --> 10865.2
name you don't see it that often that's

10863.52 --> 10868.2
funny isn't it I

10865.2 --> 10868.2
mean

10869.12 --> 10874.84
yeah there are some names that to us are

10872.04 --> 10878.0
like yeah that's just Dutch

10874.84 --> 10881.16
but see

10878.0 --> 10883.12
yoka not well if you if you're called

10881.16 --> 10886.72
yoka that's that's weird because that

10883.12 --> 10891.359
literally means lying in Dutch so if

10886.72 --> 10894.56
your name yoka that's weird like your

10891.359 --> 10897.359
mom has

10894.56 --> 10899.239
issues or maybe it's the Dutch grabler

10897.359 --> 10901.68
name or something it might

10899.239 --> 10903.479
be that they do it on purpose because

10901.68 --> 10906.56
it's like oh you're going to be very

10903.479 --> 10908.8
good good at this I don't know I'm just

10906.56 --> 10912.029999999999
blabbering at this

10908.8 --> 10912.029999999999
[Music]

10912.12 --> 10916.76
point was years before all this trans

10914.68 --> 10920.479000000001
stuff started

10916.76 --> 10923.439
[Music]

10920.479 --> 10926.08
okay I've never met the Dutch guy called

10923.439 --> 10928.239
yoka but I don't know maybe that is

10926.08 --> 10931.16
still

10928.239 --> 10934.72
doable I mean there's we there's a Dutch

10931.16 --> 10938.119999999999
classical name called Yesa that's also a

10934.72 --> 10941.92
male name which is weird it doesn't

10938.12 --> 10941.92
sound male at all but it is

10945.76 --> 10948.969000000001
[Music]

10949.319 --> 10956.72
male there's a

10951.96 --> 10959.64
movie and wa that's CIS yeah CIS the

10956.72 --> 10961.64
classical Dutch movie about some poor

10959.64 --> 10964.519999999999
guy that's just whining and complaining

10961.64 --> 10966.199999999999
all day long about how unlucky he is is

10964.52 --> 10969.560000000001
now everybody treats him like [ __ ] it's

10966.2 --> 10972.08
a terrible movie really in retrospect

10969.56 --> 10975.84
but it was seen as like a classic Dutch

10972.08 --> 10978.84
it's more a grabler movie really though

10975.84 --> 10979.960000000001
it's a poor old me everybody's so mean

10978.84 --> 10982.960000000001
to

10979.96 --> 10985.96
me it's I hate that movie

10982.96 --> 10985.96
actually

10987.6 --> 10992.319
H yoka the laugh

10992.479 --> 10995.479

SL so you could like roughly weirdly

11170.76 --> 11177.12
incorrectly translate it but like on

11294.279 --> 11296.960000000001
we're talking

11297.68 --> 11304.800000000001
about and then the origin where did it

11300.239 --> 11307.64
come from from a chop a SL which is not

11304.8 --> 11309.64
a [ __ ]

11307.64 --> 11313.119999999999
slag

11309.64 --> 11316.56
dut not English slack nothing to do with

11313.12 --> 11320.12
it totally unrelated in every

11316.56 --> 11320.119999999999
conceivable way you

11321.08 --> 11327.279
understand that's it not a conversation

11324.52 --> 11327.279
about [ __ ]

11339.56 --> 11345.319
slack cool 90-year-old man with the

11342.04 --> 11345.319000000001
Hitler stash

11351.92 --> 11357.479
Epic or a Charlie Chaplain what's the

11381.92 --> 11384.92
difference

11404.8 --> 11408.08
yes Steve Bronson of course they are

11406.52 --> 11412.08
that's what people

11408.08 --> 11413.88
do damn it again thought it was gone

11412.08 --> 11417.279
anyway it's getting dark in here I need

11413.88 --> 11417.278999999999
to like get dinner or

11422.16 --> 11427.399
something long curling mustache yeah but

11424.8 --> 11430.239
I mean Richard G do you even know why

11427.399 --> 11432.278999999999
Hitler had a mustache like that it's not

11430.239 --> 11435.72
like he invented that mustache or

11432.279 --> 11437.76
anything it was standard Fair like

11435.72 --> 11440.199999999999
throughout the 19

11437.76 --> 11442.880000000001
century early 20th

11440.2 --> 11446.960000000001
century in the military and not just

11442.88 --> 11451.0
just like Germany you know why because

11446.96 --> 11453.64
people used gas masks and mustaches

11451.0 --> 11455.439
stick out of the gas masks on the side

11453.64 --> 11457.72
which was a risk and that's why they

11455.439 --> 11459.960000000001
shared it like this so they could have a

11457.72 --> 11464.08
gas mask on without risk because of

11459.96 --> 11466.8
their mustache yeah before gas

11464.08 --> 11469.88
attacks they didn't have those mustaches

11466.8 --> 11473.84
it's literally those Hitler mustaches

11469.88 --> 11475.8
are literally because of gas attack

11473.84 --> 11477.72
when that started to happen in war

11475.8 --> 11480.599999999999
that's when those mustaches appeared

11477.72 --> 11483.92
that's the only reason that's where that

11480.6 --> 11486.800000000001
came from that's historical fact you can

11483.92 --> 11489.319
literally look it up in history when

11486.8 --> 11494.039999999999
those mustaches started to

11489.319 --> 11498.64
appear was after chemical warfare

11494.04 --> 11502.479000000001
started to happen so 19 century before

11498.64 --> 11505.399
that didn't exist or maybe no 19th

11502.479 --> 11508.96
centur I think

11505.399 --> 11511.519999999999
yeah so that's where that came

11508.96 --> 11514.358999999999
from soon as like chemical warfare

11511.52 --> 11516.560000000001
started to happen those mustaches became

11514.359 --> 11516.56
a

11517.439 --> 11523.720000000001
thing why did Charlie Chaplan have that

11520.6 --> 11526.479000000001
mustache because it was

11523.72 --> 11530.599999999999
fashionable it was originally a war

11526.479 --> 11532.358999999999
thing and people like you got to realize

11530.6 --> 11534.960000000001
that Charlie Chaplain that was before

11532.359 --> 11536.800000000001
Hitler so it was just people just did

11534.96 --> 11539.199999999999
that it became fashion even if you

11536.8 --> 11541.0
weren't like part of War it's like oh

11539.2 --> 11542.960000000001
that's a cool mustache oh that's like a

11541.0 --> 11545.479
Warrior's mustache right that's what it

11542.96 --> 11548.16
became the mustache Was A Warrior's

11545.479 --> 11551.0
mustache because people that had a

11548.16 --> 11552.76
mustache in the Army had it like that

11551.0 --> 11555.0
because you had to fit it in the gas

11552.76 --> 11557.12
mask so it's like oh that's A Warrior's

11555.0 --> 11560.04
mustache that's literally what that is

11557.12 --> 11563.960000000001
that's why Charlie Chaplain had it

11560.04 --> 11566.399000000001
probably it was just the the fashionate

11563.96 --> 11566.399
thing to

11573.16 --> 11577.96
do the fashionable thing to do

11584.16 --> 11588.439
sorry I your daughter bring a guy home

11586.72 --> 11590.8
that had the Hitler

11588.439 --> 11594.800000000001
mustache people didn't see it like that

11590.8 --> 11597.479
Steve Bronson the whole Hitler mustache

11594.8 --> 11601.96
shaming only like

11597.479 --> 11601.96
happened like after the

11602.08 --> 11608.399
40s after the war was over that's when

11605.04 --> 11613.359
suddenly it became really looked down

11608.399 --> 11615.72
upon like even during the war it's like

11613.359 --> 11618.12
oh yeah he just happens to look like

11615.72 --> 11620.96
that nobody cared about the freaking

11618.12 --> 11623.08
mustache and nobody was like hey Charlie

11620.96 --> 11625.358999999999
Chaplan you better shave up that

11623.08 --> 11628.72
mustache you look like Hitler like

11625.359 --> 11633.319
nobody cared it's like yeah that's just

11628.72 --> 11636.679999999998
a mustache right it became taboo after

11633.319 --> 11636.68
it's really dark in here by the

11645.16 --> 11652.72
way did he have a mustache I don't know

11649.359 --> 11655.56
I don't know by heart what the hell

11652.72 --> 11657.72
mustache was at all time I'm not I'm

11655.56 --> 11659.8
just giving you some historical context

11657.72 --> 11662.438999999998
here that is

11659.8 --> 11664.399
all yeah they they did create the scup

11662.439 --> 11667.399
surrounding the mustache it was the sh

11664.399 --> 11669.358999999999
the thing to shame right the whole

11667.399 --> 11672.88
shaming process that was enforced

11669.359 --> 11676.359
through media Etc that happened after

11672.88 --> 11678.519999999999
World War II was over it was not during

11676.359 --> 11682.68
