140.819 --> 147.17999999999998
most of the night and the morning but

144.3 --> 149.51000000000002
yeah then it really cleared up again and

147.18 --> 152.58
now it's kind of clouded again

149.51 --> 152.57999999999998
[Music]

153.239 --> 159.5
still some blue sky in between that

157.26 --> 159.5
foreign

168.53 --> 174.9
[Music]

171.12 --> 176.76
hello tarot 306 first in chat good to

174.9 --> 179.09900000000002
see you orinocobo

176.76 --> 180.959
Mike sudunich

179.099 --> 184.14
yeah

180.959 --> 187.14000000000001
it is Wednesday the 16th of November

184.14 --> 187.14
2022

188.06 --> 194.76
right and yeah the title

191.4 --> 197.28
it's uh I I was totally not expecting

194.76 --> 199.64
that but apparently Artemis did launch

197.28 --> 199.64000000000001
yesterday

199.98 --> 206.22
and yeah that was well that's not what I

203.099 --> 207.959
was predicting so I was wrong

206.22 --> 209.76
putting it in the title just to

207.959 --> 211.68
emphasize just to let everybody know

209.76 --> 214.85999999999999
yeah

211.68 --> 219.9
our win too can be wrong

214.86 --> 222.84
but main difference is that I will admit

219.9 --> 224.519
it right away

222.84 --> 227.459
publicly

224.519 --> 230.22
yeah that's the difference

227.459 --> 231.48
and though I am embarrassed by it in a

230.22 --> 233.7
way

231.48 --> 236.78
you also realize that it technically

233.7 --> 236.78
doesn't really matter

237.659 --> 245.17999999999998
in fact it just means oh it means

240.659 --> 245.17999999999998
they're just wasting more resources then

247.26 --> 252.17999999999998
right but yeah it did come off the

249.48 --> 255.35999999999999
ground I did actually take a look at it

252.18 --> 259.82
and yeah looked fine very typical

255.36 --> 259.82
nothing super special or anything

277.44 --> 283.08
uh no orinocobombo it's not a victory

280.8 --> 285.78000000000003
that the fake

283.08 --> 288.18
rocket launch because they're all fake

285.78 --> 290.28
because she can't go to space

288.18 --> 291.3
he doesn't have to admit anything about

290.28 --> 293.63899999999995
it

291.3 --> 295.38
yeah I have to admit and I was wrong

293.639 --> 298.139
because I said it would never come off

295.38 --> 299.639
the ground sort of a joke prediction and

298.139 --> 301.259
I really thought that was gonna come

299.639 --> 302.1
true I thought they were gonna just do

301.259 --> 305.82
that

302.1 --> 308.22
they didn't and I was wrong yeah and

305.82 --> 312.199
that's the only apology that needs to be

308.22 --> 312.199
made here concerning this

317.81 --> 321.419
[Music]

319.199 --> 324.62

321.419 --> 324.62

you need to you need to let it go dude

355.38 --> 360.24
first off it's not your launch

358.68 --> 362.52
yeah

360.24 --> 365.40000000000003
you didn't do anything

362.52 --> 369.18
you watch the video

365.4 --> 372.06
okay that's the extent of your actions

369.18 --> 374.759
and you need to let down some of that

372.06 --> 377.0
false Bravada because you didn't do

374.759 --> 377.0
anything

378.91 --> 383.34000000000003
[Music]

380.46 --> 385.08
yeah and Yeah Whatever Gets You Through

383.34 --> 387.479
today yeah that's a nice projection

385.08 --> 390.08
there yeah exactly Whatever Gets You

387.479 --> 390.08
Through the day

390.18 --> 396.65000000000003
but you need to stop the Bravada because

392.819 --> 399.75
it's [ __ ] you didn't do anything

396.65 --> 399.75
[Music]

418.46 --> 423.44
no Darren

421.919 --> 429.049
foreign

423.44 --> 429.049
[Music]

429.5 --> 435.84
so that happened I just found out pretty

432.66 --> 438.12
much an hour ago so

435.84 --> 440.34
it's not like I looked into a whole

438.12 --> 442.5
bunch of it I just

440.34 --> 444.23999999999995
watched the video that was linked up in

442.5 --> 445.62
Skype

444.24 --> 447.599
and

445.62 --> 449.94
yeah there was the actual footage in

447.599 --> 451.68
there I watched that and that's it so

449.94 --> 455.06
now I know that it is launch that's

451.68 --> 455.06
pretty much the extent of it

455.23 --> 459.66
[Music]

457.68 --> 462.13
thank you

459.66 --> 465.38000000000005
right

462.13 --> 465.38
[Music]

477.96 --> 481.099
so anyway

482.3 --> 485.86
[Music]

491.539 --> 497.81899999999996
yesterday yeah finished watching that

495.539 --> 499.8
Transformers miniseries

497.819 --> 501.96000000000004
turns out there's like a whole bunch

499.8 --> 503.879
more of them but it's a bit confusing

501.96 --> 505.5
because I think that the thing I

503.879 --> 508.86
actually watched might have been like

505.5 --> 510.9
the third part or something but it like

508.86 --> 513.9590000000001
it doesn't actually say what the

510.9 --> 516.06
chronological order of this thing is

513.959 --> 521.0
so it's kind of annoying

516.06 --> 521.0
but there's some more of it and yeah

521.94 --> 527.399
from what I've seen like that was some

524.88 --> 529.019
seriously satisfying Transformer lore

527.399 --> 532.8
being rolled out

529.019 --> 535.2
I really really really like that series

532.8 --> 537.74
I'm really surprised at how much I'm

535.2 --> 537.74
liking it

541.62 --> 548.04
it's been made by people that actually

544.38 --> 549.24
know and love Transformers and the lore

548.04 --> 551.5799999999999
of it

549.24 --> 553.5
and there's like references lots of

551.58 --> 556.86
references even to Transformers the

553.5 --> 560.12
movie in the in that one miniseries it's

556.86 --> 565.26
really [ __ ] awesome I mean

560.12 --> 565.26
Megatron Galvatron Unicron

566.519 --> 571.92
was big part of the theme

569.459 --> 575.5799999999999
you get to see all these characters even

571.92 --> 579.019
though in spirit form like oh this is

575.58 --> 579.019
again Alpha Trion

579.24 --> 585.12
all like all the like they really shove

582.36 --> 588.42
like familiar things in your face it's

585.12 --> 590.4590000000001
like it's a big Nostalgia piece

588.42 --> 592.74
it's just one part of it and it's

590.459 --> 594.54
apparently a part of a series but yeah I

592.74 --> 596.279
don't know the chronological I think I'm

594.54 --> 598.019
gonna like try to download the entire

596.279 --> 601.3389999999999
series and just want to watch it in

598.019 --> 601.339
chronological order that's

602.1 --> 604.279
foreign

605.24 --> 611.779
just clicking on on it

609.0 --> 611.779
at Netflix

611.82 --> 614.36
anyway

622.86 --> 630.0600000000001
no orinocobombo he's not changing the

626.22 --> 632.7
story the story has not been changed

630.06 --> 636.4799999999999
the only thing that changed is that it's

632.7 --> 638.519
not just a Eternal sitting dud

636.48 --> 641.399
around which a museum is going to be

638.519 --> 644.7
built like what I said doesn't make it

641.399 --> 646.56
real it's still just another fake rocket

644.7 --> 648.6600000000001
launch like all of them

646.56 --> 651.899
all of them are fake

648.66 --> 654.54
except for rocket hobbyists that are

651.899 --> 656.85
literally just making the rocket to be a

654.54 --> 667.2389999999999
rocket

656.85 --> 667.239
[Music]

669.24 --> 674.22
but yeah I mean again I'm just gonna go

672.48 --> 676.98
back to what I watched as the

674.22 --> 680.5790000000001
Transformers series war for Cybertron

676.98 --> 684.98
well from what I've seen they literally

680.579 --> 684.9799999999999
took like lore

685.079 --> 691.26
that was kind of innuendo suggested

688.86 --> 693.36
and concluded from like things like

691.26 --> 694.5
Transformers the movie and even like the

693.36 --> 697.2
third season

694.5 --> 699.899
they took all of that lore

697.2 --> 702.4200000000001
and really solidified it from being

699.899 --> 704.54
vague to being into a real thing and

702.42 --> 707.4799999999999
then integrated it into the entire

704.54 --> 712.62
cosmology of Transformers and I'm just

707.48 --> 714.0600000000001
really really impressed I mean it really

712.62 --> 719.16
was like

714.06 --> 719.16
one of the most satisfying Transformers

719.459 --> 725.459
things that I've probably ever seen

723.42 --> 728.18
it was that good it was really

725.459 --> 728.18
satisfying

729.24 --> 734.22
so yeah any Transformers fans out there

732.839 --> 737.5790000000001
check it out

734.22 --> 740.7
it's like a multiple season miniseries

737.579 --> 742.92
thing it's like six episodes

740.7 --> 747.12
many series I think

742.92 --> 748.62
Transformers war for Cybertron CGI Beast

747.12 --> 752.279
Wars Style

748.62 --> 755.279
but with the original G1 Transformers

752.279 --> 757.56
and it's really awesome

755.279 --> 759.3
like it's much better than the original

757.56 --> 761.459
G1 cartoon which was of course

759.3 --> 763.88
completely for children and all that and

761.459 --> 767.279
kind of dumbed down

763.88 --> 771.18
this one is not so much dumbed down but

767.279 --> 774.36
it did stand out to me that a lot of

771.18 --> 777.7199999999999
what like how they presented what was

774.36 --> 780.139
happening in during the series A lot of

777.72 --> 783.5400000000001
it was kind of Lent from

780.139 --> 786.72
wrestling theater that stood out to me

783.54 --> 788.579
but in a good way I mean it was like

786.72 --> 790.32
some moments it's like well this is just

788.579 --> 791.9399999999999
like a wrestling standoff like they're

790.32 --> 794.4590000000001
gonna talk before they battle and [ __ ]

791.94 --> 796.3800000000001
this just felt like it but

794.459 --> 800.2399999999999
good

796.38 --> 805.1
I mean if you like Transformers watch it

800.24 --> 805.1
you'll be surprised in a pleasant way

805.56 --> 808.579
anyway

807.0 --> 811.62
so yeah

808.579 --> 814.3199999999999
I was literally just afterward dreaming

811.62 --> 817.26
I almost felt like a kid again because

814.32 --> 820.22
it made me dream just like Transformers

817.26 --> 820.22
did when I was a kid

827.88 --> 833.399
any response anybody anybody even

830.82 --> 836.0400000000001
touched upon it or nobody gives a [ __ ]

833.399 --> 838.88
about Transformers could be you know not

836.04 --> 838.88
everybody's a fan

839.279 --> 844.279
but some kind of feedback would be nice

845.1 --> 848.779
oh my camera breaks again

855.0 --> 857.48
okay

857.959 --> 870.309
now flatter Sage with CU by the way

861.51 --> 870.309
[Music]

875.459 --> 881.06
you joined the what can't you just read

878.22 --> 883.8000000000001
it flutter Sage what

881.06 --> 884.76
or you mean of the Transformer it's

883.8 --> 888.0
called

884.76 --> 889.579
it's a multiple mini series thing but

888.0 --> 893.839
they're all called

889.579 --> 893.8389999999999
Transformers war for Cybertron

896.82 --> 899.82
anyway

908.6 --> 918.6
[Music]

915.019 --> 921.079
watched the movies

918.6 --> 924.1800000000001
Oh you mean the Michael Bay movies

921.079 --> 926.5999999999999
seeking style water

924.18 --> 928.8599999999999
because from the actual original

926.6 --> 929.66
Transformer series there's only one

928.86 --> 932.91
movie

929.66 --> 932.91
[Music]

933.72 --> 937.6990000000001
and that's like from the 80s

939.39 --> 944.89
[Music]

946.5 --> 948.74
foreign

949.22 --> 952.249
[Music]

956.279 --> 961.32
but anyway

958.38 --> 964.32
rest in peace Optimus yeah well he comes

961.32 --> 967.86
back anyway dude they dude they made

964.32 --> 972.9590000000001
that into literally

967.86 --> 976.86
like the the ultimate plot like verbally

972.959 --> 979.26
like they talk about it about prime

976.86 --> 982.86
dying and coming back

979.26 --> 986.579
about how megatrons turns into Galvatron

982.86 --> 990.72
like and him finding out about it I mean

986.579 --> 994.62
they really made everything very serious

990.72 --> 997.86
in this series it's like holy [ __ ]

994.62 --> 999.48
it it almost sorry to keep on hammering

997.86 --> 1001.1
on about it it's just I'm so impressed

999.48 --> 1003.8000000000001
it felt like

1001.1 --> 1006.279
serious fans of the original cartoons it

1003.8 --> 1010.88
felt like it could have been me

1006.279 --> 1014.18
wrote like the the topping series that

1010.88 --> 1016.399
completes the entire lore and takes the

1014.18 --> 1018.68
level of intellect to a next level of

1016.399 --> 1021.139
seriousness like for the entire that's

1018.68 --> 1024.1989999999998
what they did with this thing

1021.139 --> 1026.1200000000001
it is a massive contrast with what

1024.199 --> 1028.1000000000001
Michael Bay has been doing

1026.12 --> 1030.86
totally different

1028.1 --> 1033.819
and very true to the original lore and

1030.86 --> 1037.9389999999999
integrated with everything everything

1033.819 --> 1039.62
like including Beast Wars stuff which I

1037.939 --> 1041.48
know barely anything about because I

1039.62 --> 1042.62
never liked that series because it

1041.48 --> 1044.839
literally

1042.62 --> 1047.78
flashed like Optimus Prime in your face

1044.839 --> 1049.46
one time for like one scene and then you

1047.78 --> 1052.94
never see him again the entire Series so

1049.46 --> 1055.76
I felt like [ __ ] you Beast Wars [ __ ] you

1052.94 --> 1058.28
however it turns out here from other

1055.76 --> 1062.32
people that it was actually kind of a

1058.28 --> 1062.32
good series but I never got into it

1062.5 --> 1069.799
and the lore of that all of it is all

1067.1 --> 1072.28
integrated all of it so it's like this

1069.799 --> 1072.28
big

1073.039 --> 1077.9
thing

1075.38 --> 1082.16
lore wise that they just put in that

1077.9 --> 1086.24
series oh oh oh yeah like

1082.16 --> 1088.94
there's time travel involved

1086.24 --> 1092.6200000000001
doesn't make things complicated at all

1088.94 --> 1096.38
right but they utilize it with great

1092.62 --> 1099.08
efficiency they really do things with

1096.38 --> 1101.72
the time like really character

1099.08 --> 1104.299
development things and it's like

1101.72 --> 1109.22
I'm just really freaking impressed by

1104.299 --> 1113.2
this series I am really impressed

1109.22 --> 1113.2
and I'm not so easily

1113.539 --> 1118.299
uh so enough about that

1118.46 --> 1123.049
[Music]

1140.799 --> 1148.34
yeah oh and besides the story being

1144.26 --> 1152.679
absolutely amazing the the the graphics

1148.34 --> 1156.4399999999998
are Fantastical I mean they look

1152.679 --> 1158.539
more like the real Transformers than the

1156.44 --> 1160.76
original cartoon

1158.539 --> 1163.7
they like remember anybody who's ever

1160.76 --> 1165.919
had like bought or had their parents buy

1163.7 --> 1167.8400000000001
them Transformer toys

1165.919 --> 1169.76
like with the packaging well you might

1167.84 --> 1173.12
remember that you'd always have like one

1169.76 --> 1175.76
of these awesome 3D models off the

1173.12 --> 1177.9799999999998
Transformer on the cover right that

1175.76 --> 1180.44
looked like better than the actual

1177.98 --> 1183.32
cartoon remember that remember that any

1180.44 --> 1186.039
of you any of you yeah yeah

1183.32 --> 1190.039
well this animated series

1186.039 --> 1192.74
looks exactly like those

1190.039 --> 1195.02
like those drawings of what the

1192.74 --> 1197.6
Transformer should really look like that

1195.02 --> 1199.46
is how it looks that's how the entire

1197.6 --> 1201.08
thing looks

1199.46 --> 1204.76
yeah

1201.08 --> 1204.76
just for the record here

1217.82 --> 1220.82

1221.84 --> 1226.3999999999999
anyway

1223.58 --> 1229.059
please donate to my PayPal I really need

1226.4 --> 1229.0590000000002
it today

1229.16 --> 1233.8600000000001
would be a great relief if I got some

1234.74 --> 1240.4
because yeah it's stocking up on

1236.72 --> 1240.4
supplements has kind of like

1240.62 --> 1245.2399999999998
take a big bite out of the budget that I

1243.62 --> 1248.78
still had I mean if I hadn't done that

1245.24 --> 1251.72
then I would have just probably gotten

1248.78 --> 1253.94
through the rest of the month but I yeah

1251.72 --> 1255.559
it was with a discount and if I didn't

1253.94 --> 1258.5
buy it now that means that it would have

1255.559 --> 1261.799
to buy it later without a discount which

1258.5 --> 1264.74
would cost me more money so

1261.799 --> 1266.36
I just felt I had to do it

1264.74 --> 1269.02
but I could really use some support

1266.36 --> 1269.02
right now

1269.179 --> 1273.039
to like get through the next week

1364.58 --> 1368.4189999999999
yesterday's show was actually really

1366.38 --> 1370.46

1759.44 --> 1764.8600000000001
just don't do the show for a week then

1765.74 --> 1769.0
how about that

1771.14 --> 1774.5800000000002
what do you think about that

1777.159 --> 1782.74
I mean does anybody here care at all

1785.179 --> 1790.8200000000002
How can there be

like 10 people in my chat and that

1790.82 --> 1797.6589999999999

1836.15 --> 1839.3290000000002
[Music]

1839.48 --> 1845.6
what kind of a remark is that

1842.6 --> 1850.2199999999998
you know how the show Works a man like

1845.6 --> 1854.98
me don't be a smart ass it's not funny

1850.22 --> 1857.559
yeah you know how long 10 minutes yeah

1854.98 --> 1860.3600000000001
look at the numbers

1857.559 --> 1864.279
10 minutes

1860.36 --> 1864.279
that is intolerable

1868.399 --> 1877.2199999999998
actually set here and I counted it five

1872.539 --> 1879.03
minutes straight silent and there was no

1877.22 --> 1883.089
response

1879.03 --> 1883.089
[Music]

1888.32 --> 1891.039
I mean

1891.559 --> 1897.62
what am I doing here

1894.5 --> 1900.44
well I I could just as well turn on some

1897.62 --> 1902.4189999999999
standard crappy radio it wouldn't even

1900.44 --> 1905.6200000000001
matter to you would it

1902.419 --> 1908.8990000000001
because you'll have five minutes of

1905.62 --> 1911.12
uninterrupted silence without a single

1908.899 --> 1913.1589999999999
response

1911.12 --> 1914.6589999999999
why don't you just turn on the [ __ ]

1913.159 --> 1916.46
radio then

1914.659 --> 1920.2
huh

1916.46 --> 1920.2
what the hell's wrong with you people

1932.419 --> 1938.779
it's not an excuse a man like me

1936.02 --> 1941.26
it's not an excuse if you're tuned into

1938.779 --> 1941.26
the show

1942.14 --> 1947.72
well

1943.76 --> 1951.14
people should feel internal alarm Bells

1947.72 --> 1952.76
when they hear five minutes of straight

1951.14 --> 1955.159
silence

1952.76 --> 1957.46
well apparently you didn't none of you

1955.159 --> 1957.46
did

1959.96 --> 1964.88
oh you're busy yeah you're busy yeah

1962.899 --> 1967.8799999999999
well why don't you just turn on the

1964.88 --> 1969.7990000000002
[ __ ] radio then yeah you can be busy

1967.88 --> 1971.0
while you put that on in the background

1969.799 --> 1973.1589999999999
too

1971.0 --> 1975.32
don't have to type anything you don't

1973.159 --> 1978.0200000000002
have to communicate nothing

1975.32 --> 1981.8799999999999
it's very easy

1978.02 --> 1981.8799999999999
that's not what my show is for

1981.98 --> 1988.159
this show is about participation

1985.76 --> 1991.22
not just having something in the

1988.159 --> 1994.3990000000001
background if you want that why even

1991.22 --> 1997.419
tune in you can just listen to my show

1994.399 --> 1997.4189999999999
afterward then

2000.41 --> 2007.42
[Music]

2010.059 --> 2014.019
yeah fine Jared I know you were going

2012.279 --> 2016.84
out for snacks

2014.019 --> 2019.679
you're excused but seriously you're not

2016.84 --> 2019.6789999999999
the only one here

2026.08 --> 2033.299
I mean there's supposedly 20 watching

2029.2 --> 2033.299
right now yeah live watching

thank you

2039.7 --> 2050.239
[Music]

2057.359 --> 2062.5
that's my take on what comets are

2060.52 --> 2065.919
uh

2062.5 --> 2067.599
I'm not entirely sure but to me from the

2065.919 --> 2070.54
things that I've seen they seem to be

2067.599 --> 2074.02
purely like a Celestial phenomenon so

2070.54 --> 2076.74
they are like stars but temporary

2074.02 --> 2076.74
and weird

2077.919 --> 2083.0989999999997
yeah they do not seem to be physical to

2080.919 --> 2083.0989999999997
me

2084.61 --> 2087.9190000000003
[Music]

2100.06 --> 2104.98
makes more sense than just a rock

2102.64 --> 2106.839
well

2104.98 --> 2109.42
when you're talking about comments right

2106.839 --> 2113.02
not meteors meteors are supposedly rocks

2109.42 --> 2116.5
comets are just big chunks of ice

2113.02 --> 2119.079
that leave like the Tails and [ __ ] and

2116.5 --> 2122.079
that's well how they show it in the CGI

2119.079 --> 2123.04
but also from if you can actually see a

2122.079 --> 2125.2000000000003
comment

2123.04 --> 2128.68
with like a telescope

2125.2 --> 2131.0789999999997
they yeah they look like they're it's a

2128.68 --> 2133.1189999999997
light but that's kind of like hay that

2131.079 --> 2137.579
leaves it Haze

2133.119 --> 2137.579
it's weird that's what it looks like

2158.74 --> 2161.8199999999997
hey let's see

2165.28 --> 2171.0400000000004
Rocky mistake mixed up yeah yeah that

2169.119 --> 2174.96
thought something like that

2171.04 --> 2174.96
I used to mix them up all the time

2175.61 --> 2183.73
[Music]

2187.18 --> 2191.2599999999998
right but yeah comets Celestial

2189.52 --> 2196.359
phenomena

2191.26 --> 2199.32
meteors not sure it's confusing

2196.359 --> 2202.18
I think that there is

2199.32 --> 2205.42
Celestial light

2202.18 --> 2208.7799999999997
based meteors or yeah the falling star

2205.42 --> 2211.66
the flip the quick

2208.78 --> 2214.0
like liner light thing I think that

2211.66 --> 2218.44
that's celestial

2214.0 --> 2221.2
but there is also well apparently

2218.44 --> 2223.18
things that can even get very close to

2221.2 --> 2226.839
the ground

2223.18 --> 2228.8199999999997
and you can hear them and all that

2226.839 --> 2231.46
so

2228.82 --> 2234.2400000000002
there is that and it's extremely

2231.46 --> 2238.54
mysterious to me I don't know

2234.24 --> 2241.24
how every time the subject comes up I'll

2238.54 --> 2243.94
start speculating of course

2241.24 --> 2246.64
but it will all be kind of kooky and

2243.94 --> 2248.079
weird because it's just super surreal to

2246.64 --> 2250.1189999999997
me

2248.079 --> 2253.54
meteors

2250.119 --> 2255.6400000000003
like I don't understand completely

2253.54 --> 2258.52
like there could be a lot more

2255.64 --> 2261.7799999999997
complicated back works that I just do

2258.52 --> 2261.78
not have an understanding of

2274.48 --> 2279.4
I mean dude I could throw it as far as

2277.839 --> 2284.14
that meteors

2279.4 --> 2287.92
are like a Divine phenomenon

2284.14 --> 2290.68
that maybe it was literally just there

2287.92 --> 2291.76
just to have basically a bombardment

2290.68 --> 2295.2
system

2291.76 --> 2295.2000000000003
for the Elohim

2295.839 --> 2301.96
yeah maybe it's just that just that just

2299.859 --> 2304.5989999999997
a way to just like uh

2301.96 --> 2307.599
portal whatever from wherever it

2304.599 --> 2310.42
materializes it's just it you cannot

2307.599 --> 2313.42
make logical consecutive sense and it's

2310.42 --> 2316.119
just boom there's a media there or right

2313.42 --> 2318.52
above the ground or whatever it might be

2316.119 --> 2320.92
a Divine system

2318.52 --> 2323.56
that it's literally just portals opening

2320.92 --> 2326.859
and meteors literally coming out of

2323.56 --> 2328.54
absolutely nowhere materializing just to

2326.859 --> 2331.66
be freaking meteors

2328.54 --> 2334.66
it could be that I do not know it's

2331.66 --> 2335.8199999999997
really rare to me

2334.66 --> 2338.3199999999997
definitely

2335.82 --> 2340.839
non-holographic non-celestial based

2338.32 --> 2343.9
meteors as well there's all kinds of

2340.839 --> 2348.16
things concerning that I mean

2343.9 --> 2352.06
some of them or all of them are

2348.16 --> 2355.1189999999997
could be giant catapulted rocks that

2352.06 --> 2357.099
it's like a human thing to do

2355.119 --> 2360.82
there's a secret society that literally

2357.099 --> 2363.6400000000003
is just there to keep doing that

2360.82 --> 2367.5
to keep the meteors in

2363.64 --> 2369.2799999999997
the storyline as part of heliocentrism

2367.5 --> 2371.859
[Music]

2369.28 --> 2374.26
who the hell knows man it could be that

2371.859 --> 2378.16
it could be a pure Divine mechanism

2374.26 --> 2379.9
where God or the Elohim the

2378.16 --> 2383.44
representatives that have that ability

2379.9 --> 2386.44
can just like open portal and boom giant

2383.44 --> 2388.66
meteor comes out or little mini airs or

2386.44 --> 2391.2400000000002
like what happened with Sodom and

2388.66 --> 2393.06
Gomorrah right

2391.24 --> 2396.7799999999997
it's uh

2393.06 --> 2396.7799999999997
balls of sulfur

2398.26 --> 2403.5400000000004
it could be literally a Divine mechanism

2401.32 --> 2405.7000000000003
that is just incredibly beyond their

2403.54 --> 2410.2599999999998
understanding that is probably like

2405.7 --> 2412.7799999999997
super high tech just beyond normal grip

2410.26 --> 2416.88
and that it was built into the realm

2412.78 --> 2416.88
just to provide that option

2416.98 --> 2422.02
that if a Divine interfacing being can

2419.68 --> 2425.64
just can

2422.02 --> 2425.64
just summon that

2425.8 --> 2428.94
it could be that

2448.119 --> 2454.619
some of that might be sentient what what

2452.26 --> 2454.619
do you mean

2457.42 --> 2461.92
no no

2460.06 --> 2464.0789999999997
okay at least

2461.92 --> 2465.88
I thought you said pocket refraction

2464.079 --> 2468.9
there for a second

2465.88 --> 2468.9
it's hilarious

2473.96 --> 2490.14
[Music]

2487.359 --> 2490.14
foreign

2490.27 --> 2494.979
[Music]

2500.52 --> 2507.099
anyway like the last two examples I gave

2504.22 --> 2510.8799999999997
like yeah man-made catapult

2507.099 --> 2512.98
something like that or a Divine inherent

2510.88 --> 2515.2000000000003
option

2512.98 --> 2517.54
those are the like the two that are at

2515.2 --> 2520.2999999999997
least like non-cyclical in nature

2517.54 --> 2523.599
because as soon as I have to actually

2520.3 --> 2526.0600000000004
find a cyclical way for that to work

2523.599 --> 2528.76
then if things get really weird and you

2526.06 --> 2531.94
you end up with my theory about

2528.76 --> 2535.48
my concept idea

2531.94 --> 2537.66
about how there might be a helium

2535.48 --> 2540.52
hydrogen collector that literally

2537.66 --> 2543.22
transforms that material slowly and

2540.52 --> 2544.66
gradually into meteoric material

2543.22 --> 2546.16
[Music]

2544.66 --> 2550.66
right

2546.16 --> 2553.24
to make it a cyclical natural system

2550.66 --> 2556.18
but yeah I mean

2553.24 --> 2558.3999999999996
I cannot exclude that it would be just a

2556.18 --> 2561.16
Divine option that it's really like this

2558.4 --> 2562.7200000000003
weird open and specifically for the

2561.16 --> 2566.04
divine

2562.72 --> 2566.04
that enter the world

2573.339 --> 2580.0
but on the other hand like it could also

2576.099 --> 2582.2200000000003
be a catapult system because well

2580.0 --> 2585.94
it does it just doesn't happen that

2582.22 --> 2588.52
often yeah the supposed meteors that get

2585.94 --> 2591.7200000000003
really close to the ground

2588.52 --> 2595.02
how many times does that happen

2591.72 --> 2595.02
very little

2595.359 --> 2599.319
I mean like once a year or something

2597.94 --> 2602.079
maybe

2599.319 --> 2605.2599999999998
twice perhaps

2602.079 --> 2606.76
in the entire world right so that's a

2605.26 --> 2608.98
rare occurrence in the first instance

2606.76 --> 2612.2200000000003
well then it might even be more

2608.98 --> 2614.44
plausible that it is man made

2612.22 --> 2616.48
because if it would be something that

2614.44 --> 2619.06
would be continually happening well then

2616.48 --> 2623.339
there would be continual traceable

2619.06 --> 2623.339
evidence of it being done by men

2623.5 --> 2630.339
it would be harder to conceal

2626.68 --> 2634.02
so yeah three options and all of them

2630.339 --> 2635.56
are yeah kind of weird

2634.02 --> 2636.18
[Music]

2635.56 --> 2640.2999999999997
yeah

2636.18 --> 2643.5989999999997
Divine man-made or part of a natural

2640.3 --> 2645.46
cycle system it could be on all of them

2643.599 --> 2647.78
I don't know

2645.46 --> 2649.78
or a combination

2647.78 --> 2651.76
[Music]

2649.78 --> 2654.78
you keep calling it comments we're

2651.76 --> 2654.78
talking about meteors

2656.14 --> 2662.319
no they're not versus no they're

2659.099 --> 2664.3
absolutely not pieces of the firmament

2662.319 --> 2666.599
that's the dumbest Theory I've ever

2664.3 --> 2670.3590000000004
heard flat earther say

2666.599 --> 2673.079
it is really dumb to assume that that is

2670.359 --> 2673.0789999999997
possible

2674.319 --> 2677.98
how the hell would it even build up that

2676.839 --> 2679.48
speed

2677.98 --> 2682.18
that

2679.48 --> 2684.46
I mean if it's a piece of deferment why

2682.18 --> 2686.94
wouldn't it just fall like a piece of

2684.46 --> 2686.94
material

2687.94 --> 2695.14
because it doesn't do that no it shoots

2690.64 --> 2698.68
off at extreme speeds downward yeah

2695.14 --> 2702.7599999999998
things falling don't do that

2698.68 --> 2704.98
not a piece of the firmament decides to

2702.76 --> 2706.48
assume that the firmament is literally

2704.98 --> 2708.819
buckling

2706.48 --> 2711.72
in in the form of meteors like who the

2708.819 --> 2711.72
hell came up with that

2715.24 --> 2720.9399999999996
who the hell says there even is a

2717.88 --> 2722.2000000000003
firmament that is made of material that

2720.94 --> 2726.46
can buckle

2722.2 --> 2727.8999999999996
and then what kind of a designer

2726.46 --> 2730.839
would make

2727.9 --> 2733.54
like a critical piece of infrastructure

2730.839 --> 2737.7999999999997
that can literally just break apart over

2733.54 --> 2740.5
time seems kind of ridiculous also

2737.8 --> 2742.9
yeah yeah yeah here's the last part okay

2740.5 --> 2747.22
if it's pieces of the firmament buckling

2742.9 --> 2750.099
then why didn't all hell come down right

2747.22 --> 2752.4399999999996
after operation fistball fish boy yeah

2750.099 --> 2753.9
when they supposedly blew up all that

2752.44 --> 2757.359
[ __ ] up there

2753.9 --> 2761.2000000000003
why the hell didn't all like the

2757.359 --> 2763.7799999999997
thousands of meteors come down then

2761.2 --> 2767.2799999999997
they didn't at all no response

2763.78 --> 2767.28
whatsoever was there

2781.78 --> 2790.0600000000004
yeah don't worry no yeah saving is

2786.46 --> 2792.16
speculating whoever Sage

2790.06 --> 2794.14
but it's just I've heard it so many

2792.16 --> 2796.48
times and it just like keeps on

2794.14 --> 2798.46
spreading and spreading it oh I can

2796.48 --> 2800.02
imagine it yeah it's really stupid

2798.46 --> 2803.56
though

2800.02 --> 2805.96
I mean what kind of idiot designer would

2803.56 --> 2809.5
have a critical piece of infrastructure

2805.96 --> 2812.079
be able to just break apart like that

2809.5 --> 2814.9
to have regular phenomenon so that

2812.079 --> 2817.8590000000004
literally the breaking apart of the

2814.9 --> 2821.26
entire design would be noticeable

2817.859 --> 2825.2799999999997
Forever on a yearly basis that seems

2821.26 --> 2828.94
just too [ __ ] to be true

2825.28 --> 2831.7000000000003
I mean no just no

2828.94 --> 2833.56
not a piece of the firmament I don't

2831.7 --> 2835.359
think the firmament is even a physical

2833.56 --> 2837.88
thing

2835.359 --> 2840.96
just the end of space

2837.88 --> 2840.96
and it's flat

2848.44 --> 2851.98
yeah

2849.4 --> 2855.2200000000003
it's flat it's not material and there's

2851.98 --> 2857.26
not pieces breaking of it

2855.22 --> 2860.0789999999997
it's ridiculous

2857.26 --> 2863.619
if if there's anything breaking off it

2860.079 --> 2865.42
then that must be material that was like

2863.619 --> 2867.28
sedimented

2865.42 --> 2869.319
through perhaps the transformation

2867.28 --> 2872.88
process and then it comes together right

2869.319 --> 2876.579
so what if there is at the layer a weird

2872.88 --> 2880.1800000000003
process that like what if basically a

2876.579 --> 2883.3
student as a hydrogen or helium

2880.18 --> 2886.359
uh atom touches

2883.3 --> 2888.76
well the firmament or the flat top that

2886.359 --> 2890.98
it just makes it instantly electrically

2888.76 --> 2894.6400000000003
transformed

2890.98 --> 2897.7
that way then yeah sediment might so not

2894.64 --> 2900.42
the firmament but sediment on the

2897.7 --> 2903.5789999999997
firmament might be building up that way

2900.42 --> 2905.319
breaking apart and then a meteor might

2903.579 --> 2907.9
fall off well then you go with the

2905.319 --> 2911.02
natural cycle thing right but it would

2907.9 --> 2914.619
not be the firmament it would be

2911.02 --> 2916.54
sediment on the firmament

2914.619 --> 2918.78
difficult what the [ __ ] are you talking

2916.54 --> 2918.7799999999997
about

2919.48 --> 2925.2
difficult what the [ __ ] are you no

2922.0 --> 2925.2
sounds perfectly fine

2929.2 --> 2933.7599999999998
what are you talking about

2931.359 --> 2937.68
my sound is fine

2933.76 --> 2937.6800000000003
I just listened to it it's fine

2946.72 --> 2951.2999999999997
well there's literally nothing I can do

2948.819 --> 2951.3
about it

2954.579 --> 2961.44
yeah the only thing I can do about it is

2957.339 --> 2961.44
end the show and restart my computer

2967.54 --> 2971.98
jiggle the court yeah you know what that

2969.64 --> 2974.02
can result in right that means that the

2971.98 --> 2976.599
mic will fall out and then I won't be

2974.02 --> 2979.38
able to get it on again until I restart

2976.599 --> 2983.579
my computer

2979.38 --> 2983.579
so how about I don't do that

2994.839 --> 3000.18
no I'm not gonna do that because it

2998.319 --> 3002.96
might break and then I have to restart

3000.18 --> 3002.96
my computer

3009.9 --> 3014.119
okay can we stick to the subject please

3021.599 --> 3026.42
did any of you follow me

3023.94 --> 3026.42
right

3027.06 --> 3033.66
about the supposed meteors being the

3029.7 --> 3035.7
firmament well no it can't be but maybe

3033.66 --> 3040.2
there is sediment

3035.7 --> 3043.5
forming slowly on the ceiling

3040.2 --> 3045.96
that may turn into what become chunks of

3043.5 --> 3049.26
meteor and who knows maybe they're even

3045.96 --> 3050.7
like electromagnetically like launched

3049.26 --> 3052.6800000000003
off it like

3050.7 --> 3054.359
that as soon as they can that they're on

3052.68 --> 3056.64
their constant tension even as they're

3054.359 --> 3058.5589999999997
forming like it might be like weirdly

3056.64 --> 3060.54
electrically pressure there might be

3058.559 --> 3063.1800000000003
something really weird going on directly

3060.54 --> 3065.7
at the top

3063.18 --> 3067.74
and then the gas is just kind of slip in

3065.7 --> 3069.5989999999997
and then they transmute and it slowly

3067.74 --> 3071.52
forms this weird sediment it might be

3069.599 --> 3074.579
kind of unstable and then at some point

3071.52 --> 3077.099
it might literally like wriggle itself

3074.579 --> 3078.119
or vibrate itself loose and then just a

3077.099 --> 3080.94
chunk

3078.119 --> 3083.1600000000003
maybe like like a like magnetic

3080.94 --> 3086.4
repulsion just

3083.16 --> 3087.5989999999997
shoots off super fast

3086.4 --> 3090.2400000000002
yeah

3087.599 --> 3091.98
that could be it

3090.24 --> 3096.24
that could be what's called that's

3091.98 --> 3099.859
actually a pretty good model in my mind

3096.24 --> 3099.859
that may be how it's happening

3099.96 --> 3106.079
I was thinking of like a machine but it

3102.3 --> 3108.9
might literally be just the top that is

3106.079 --> 3110.52
just has a really bizarre electrical

3108.9 --> 3114.599
charge or something

3110.52 --> 3118.22
that just like transmutes

3114.599 --> 3118.2200000000003
the gas that touch it

3118.74 --> 3124.7999999999997
and that's well meteoric sediment just

3122.4 --> 3128.099
starts to form and then eventually kind

3124.8 --> 3130.8
of like under the tension and all that

3128.099 --> 3133.7400000000002
break loose and then typically like I've

3130.8 --> 3136.079
seen like magnetic repulsion just shoots

3133.74 --> 3138.18
up like

3136.079 --> 3140.9
super fast

3138.18 --> 3140.8999999999996
right

3141.079 --> 3145.619
that might be it I mean think about it

3144.059 --> 3147.96
think about what you're seeing what

3145.619 --> 3152.7200000000003
you're seeing a falling start that

3147.96 --> 3152.7200000000003
doesn't wouldn't that be logical

3162.839 --> 3166.16
hey when they call

3174.57 --> 3177.78
[Music]

3179.94 --> 3182.119
thank you

3185.66 --> 3192.0
I don't know what's wrong with this mic

3188.22 --> 3193.6189999999997
but yeah dude I can wriggle around and

3192.0 --> 3196.559
then if it's not gonna work again I'm

3193.619 --> 3199.319
gonna round out round out the show just

3196.559 --> 3202.3190000000004
for the record okay so I'm I'm gonna I'm

3199.319 --> 3204.7799999999997
gonna work on your nuisances now and it

3202.319 --> 3207.74
might result in the end of the show okay

3204.78 --> 3207.7400000000002
yeah

3207.94 --> 3211.05
[Music]

3224.88 --> 3227.7200000000003
foreign

3228.02 --> 3233.78
lucky it's still working so anything

3231.059 --> 3233.78
changed

3241.28 --> 3249.5

3246.54 --> 3249.5

all right

3288.7 --> 3301.74
[Music]

3297.78 --> 3304.1400000000003
right so again I'm gonna ask anybody can

3301.74 --> 3306.6189999999997
help me out through the PayPal I really

3304.14 --> 3306.6189999999997
need it

3307.92 --> 3316.94
I know I got some donations recently but

3311.76 --> 3316.94
I already informed you I yeah spent it

3319.2 --> 3324.5989999999997
um supplements that I really needed

3322.859 --> 3328.64
and uh

3324.599 --> 3328.6400000000003
save myself some money that way

3330.72 --> 3335.52
because I was gonna eventually spend

3333.059 --> 3337.1400000000003
that anyway

3335.52 --> 3340.44
those supplements

3337.14 --> 3343.339
so really please donate to my PayPal

3340.44 --> 3343.339
and let me know

3345.72 --> 3351.02
God how many freaking got these things

3348.0 --> 3351.02
do I have to click

3352.98 --> 3355.819
just

3359.54 --> 3366.54
oh and a text message the first like

3363.24 --> 3369.72
freaking 20 of those things and then

3366.54 --> 3371.4
oh my God

3369.72 --> 3372.73
I feel I might be a little bit

3371.4 --> 3376.619
complaining today

[Music]

3377.4 --> 3383.88
but then again it's

3380.579 --> 3388.3390000000004
because I was wrong

3383.88 --> 3388.339
but the stupid Artemis launch

3388.74 --> 3396.14
and I feel a bit embarrassed about it

3391.5 --> 3399.839
[Music]

3396.14 --> 3401.819
not as a flat earther but just as a

3399.839 --> 3405.119
Oracle person

3401.819 --> 3408.0
makes me feel stupid and takes away the

3405.119 --> 3411.6600000000003
power of my oracling

3408.0 --> 3415.38
not all of it but it's not helping

3411.66 --> 3417.839
so I think I'm just gonna completely

3415.38 --> 3420.9
not make stupid predictions anymore

3417.839 --> 3423.2599999999998
about this nonsense

3420.9 --> 3428.1800000000003

3444.66 --> 3447.839
know

3446.339 --> 3451.319
foreign

3447.839 --> 3454.5789999999997
because I actually need it

3451.319 --> 3454.579
mostly for food

3458.16 --> 3463.16
technically supplements are food I spend

3460.559 --> 3463.1600000000003
it on food

3487.619 --> 3494.28
right but anyway besides making silly

3490.5 --> 3496.8
predictions about Artemis I think that I

3494.28 --> 3498.3
roll out a whole bunch of really awesome

3496.8 --> 3502.2000000000003
ideas

3498.3 --> 3505.319
like the last months

3502.2 --> 3507.1189999999997
I mean how about my freaking space

3505.319 --> 3510.0589999999997

3507.119 --> 3512.7200000000003

3510.059 --> 3512.7200000000003
huh

3523.2 --> 3526.3999999999996
how about that one

3526.559 --> 3534.119
that's a pretty epic idea I'd say

3530.46 --> 3538.26
then of course there's the uh

3534.119 --> 3541.819
is it Drive in private space idea

3538.26 --> 3541.8190000000004
thought that was pretty Epic

3543.0 --> 3548.76
and I've had more but especially if I

3545.819 --> 3551.7
just scroll through recently I come to

3548.76 --> 3554.7000000000003
find that the last time I didn't have a

3551.7 --> 3557.04
title is two weeks ago

3554.7 --> 3561.859
I'm pretty impressed by that if I say so

3557.04 --> 3561.859
myself and I am saying it so myself

3592.05 --> 3596.6490000000003
[Music]

3599.28 --> 3605.28
what did I say about Artemis

3602.339 --> 3607.44
well a man like me

3605.28 --> 3609.3590000000004
when like that stuff started to come up

3607.44 --> 3611.64
and like all the postponing of the

3609.359 --> 3613.5589999999997
launches I was kind of assuming that it

3611.64 --> 3615.18
would never come off the ground and it

3613.559 --> 3617.52
would just sit there forever and that

3615.18 --> 3619.6189999999997
they'd eventually build a museum around

3617.52 --> 3622.44
it or something

3619.619 --> 3624.599
that's kind of what I was predicting

3622.44 --> 3627.319
and then it launched yesterday and now I

3624.599 --> 3627.319
feel embarrassed

3628.859 --> 3633.24
I mean it's still a funny concept that I

3631.559 --> 3635.94
put down I mean

3633.24 --> 3639.1189999999997
they could have done it but they didn't

3635.94 --> 3641.299
and so I was wrong and so I yeah I was

3639.119 --> 3641.299
wrong

3646.4 --> 3654.119
[Music]

3660.599 --> 3663.02

3678.18 --> 3683.339
wow by the way there's some real

3680.4 --> 3685.079
political upheaval [ __ ] starting to

3683.339 --> 3687.98
happen in the Netherlands

3685.079 --> 3687.98
this party

3689.4 --> 3694.559
among the cartel parties is like getting

3691.619 --> 3698.579
so egregious d66

3694.559 --> 3701.4
or D 666 as they know

3698.579 --> 3702.299
are called typically why a lot of Dutch

3701.4 --> 3704.94
people

3702.299 --> 3708.78
as willing as far as to go as to say

3704.94 --> 3712.26
that yeah we want to forbid

3708.78 --> 3714.78
our opposition political parties

3712.26 --> 3716.7000000000003
yeah and remember the d stands for

3714.78 --> 3721.2000000000003
democracy and they're just saying like

3716.7 --> 3724.14
no that other party because of this

3721.2 --> 3726.54
information blah blah blah we want to

3724.14 --> 3729.18
make that party illegal

3726.54 --> 3731.64
even though they're literally already in

3729.18 --> 3735.3799999999997
Parliament have a lot of people that

3731.64 --> 3735.3799999999997
back them even now

3735.42 --> 3738.079
this paper

3738.18 --> 3742.46
and by the way like that entire

3739.98 --> 3746.22
political party has been completely

3742.46 --> 3747.839
saturated with wef influences and

3746.22 --> 3750.839
they're probably I think that that party

3747.839 --> 3752.5789999999997
is probably not gonna make it

3750.839 --> 3755.46
I think the entire thing is going to be

3752.579 --> 3756.6600000000003
disbanded

3755.46 --> 3759.18
in

3756.66 --> 3763.2599999999998
in the yeah not too long

3759.18 --> 3766.94
I don't know years still probably but I

3763.26 --> 3766.94
mean it's done that party's done

3767.64 --> 3770.839
so that's happening

3778.16 --> 3785.48
okay okay okay okay thank you letter

3781.74 --> 3785.4799999999996
Sage I really appreciate that

3790.74 --> 3796.9799999999996
right well look guys

3793.5 --> 3799.619
I really do need the support but

3796.98 --> 3801.72
I mean if it's like in just a few days

3799.619 --> 3804.859
instead of right now then I could

3801.72 --> 3804.859
probably survive that

3806.94 --> 3812.099
it's like Friday or something but uh

3810.0 --> 3815.839
yeah

3812.099 --> 3815.839
I did really have to ask today

3840.48 --> 3845.81
hey steam Traveler

3843.359 --> 3849.0699999999997
you're late

3849.299 --> 3855.559
I could have used you before when there

3851.4 --> 3855.559
was literally 10 minutes of silence

3856.68 --> 3862.44
and everybody that was in chat up until

3860.16 --> 3865.74
that point apparently was on break or

3862.44 --> 3868.92
something or going out

3865.74 --> 3871.02
because there was literally 10 minutes

3868.92 --> 3873.2400000000002
of silence

3871.02 --> 3876.619
I almost ended the show I was really

3873.24 --> 3876.6189999999997
kind of pissed off about it

3878.16 --> 3882.96
but then yeah the show continued and it

3880.68 --> 3885.1189999999997
got interesting again

3882.96 --> 3887.7
but yeah I don't want that to ever

3885.119 --> 3890.94
happen again just for the record yeah I

3887.7 --> 3893.0989999999997
mean if that's how you go about then you

3890.94 --> 3897.7200000000003
can just as well turn on the standard

3893.099 --> 3899.339
stupid ass pop music radio channel

3897.72 --> 3902.819
because

3899.339 --> 3905.94
with me it's about the interaction not

3902.819 --> 3908.819
just about me blabbering eternally

3905.94 --> 3911.2200000000003
against the wall

3908.819 --> 3912.42
in the hopes that somebody's amused by

3911.22 --> 3915.72
it

3912.42 --> 3918.92
I'm actually talking with people

3915.72 --> 3918.9199999999996
answering questions

3919.02 --> 3925.339
that's all interaction based it's not

3921.359 --> 3925.339
just me monologuing against the wall

3928.54 --> 3936.599
[Music]

3937.52 --> 3942.44
but it is funny because yeah the

3939.96 --> 3945.359
question earlier about the

3942.44 --> 3947.64
Comets you kept mixing up comments and

3945.359 --> 3952.22
meet tears but

3947.64 --> 3955.98
in my mind visually it kind of like

3952.22 --> 3958.5589999999997
improved a bit on my on what I used to

3955.98 --> 3962.04
call like the

3958.559 --> 3964.7400000000002
the meteor Transformer process where

3962.04 --> 3967.38
helium and hydrogen would somehow be

3964.74 --> 3970.5589999999997
transformed into meteoric material well

3967.38 --> 3972.359
now I basically and visualized it

3970.559 --> 3973.8590000000004
in a way where that makes even more

3972.359 --> 3976.799
sense

3973.859 --> 3978.42
on how that would happen

3976.799 --> 3980.339
there would definitely have to be

3978.42 --> 3982.799
electric forces at Play Because while

3980.339 --> 3984.0
electrics is the only thing that can

3982.799 --> 3985.92
even

3984.0 --> 3988.38
achieve any form of material

3985.92 --> 3990.119
transmutation which would have to be

3988.38 --> 3993.1800000000003
part of it

3990.119 --> 3997.26
but yeah it could be at

3993.18 --> 3999.96
against the firmament not the firmament

3997.26 --> 4001.5200000000004
itself or against the flat top whatever

3999.96 --> 4003.38
that is

4001.52 --> 4006.68
and if there is like this massive

4003.38 --> 4010.579
electric charge on it then it might just

4006.68 --> 4013.339
well do that any more any atom that

4010.579 --> 4014.48
comes in contact with it and it is super

4013.339 --> 4017.299
thin

4014.48 --> 4018.68
pressure up there but they're still

4017.299 --> 4020.9
gonna be

4018.68 --> 4024.319
atoms going in all directions that's

4020.9 --> 4027.619
what gases do including there and it

4024.319 --> 4031.88
might be that any atom that touches the

4027.619 --> 4034.52
firmament literally becomes fused to it

4031.88 --> 4035.96
and starts to form this meteoric

4034.52 --> 4038.24
material

4035.96 --> 4040.28
that then just kind of like cooked like

4038.24 --> 4042.68
plaques

4040.28 --> 4045.38
sediment onto

4042.68 --> 4047.4199999999996
the flat top and well if there's

4045.38 --> 4049.1600000000003
electricity going through all that

4047.42 --> 4051.38
continually

4049.16 --> 4053.7799999999997
then it wouldn't be surprising if it

4051.38 --> 4056.0
started to like get brittle and then at

4053.78 --> 4059.0
some point if some part would like break

4056.0 --> 4061.339
up with it like its last part like

4059.0 --> 4062.44
that it would be like magnetically

4061.339 --> 4065.18
launched

4062.44 --> 4068.96
so that it literally you have the flat

4065.18 --> 4071.5589999999997
top you have like chunks of meat here

4068.96 --> 4071.559
like

4074.059 --> 4078.52
uh what do you call that uh

4079.94 --> 4084.92
like what erosion looks like right

4083.42 --> 4088.2200000000003
like

4084.92 --> 4090.2000000000003
ground that was moist that dries up and

4088.22 --> 4092.24
then it kind of like breaks up in like

4090.2 --> 4095.299
segments right

4092.24 --> 4097.639999999999
there's photos of that how that looks

4095.299 --> 4100.219
well that is kind of in my mind what

4097.64 --> 4102.92
would happen against the the firmament

4100.219 --> 4107.96
itself that it would just like plaque up

4102.92 --> 4110.06
and then start to form like yeah isolate

4107.96 --> 4112.52
and then at some point pieces might

4110.06 --> 4115.04
break off of that flat top and then as

4112.52 --> 4118.339000000001
soon as it actually comes loose

4115.04 --> 4119.229
it it becomes magnetically launched it

4118.339 --> 4122.299
just goes like

4119.229 --> 4124.46
[Music]

4122.299 --> 4126.739
and well that's kind of what it looks

4124.46 --> 4129.44
like now doesn't it the the falling

4126.739 --> 4131.9
stars it's like subtly poof

4129.44 --> 4134.0599999999995
just out of nowhere super speed so that

4131.9 --> 4137.719
seems like there's a magnetic effect

4134.06 --> 4141.679
like it's being magnetically repulsed so

4137.719 --> 4142.64
yeah I basically refined my meteors idea

4141.679 --> 4146.02
today

4142.64 --> 4146.02
thanks to inquiry

4154.16 --> 4161.54
could it be like pieces of rust falling

4157.219 --> 4164.779
off an old art Steel Bridge yeah sort of

4161.54 --> 4166.16
but the bridge is not the firmament just

4164.779 --> 4169.040000000001
for the record

4166.16 --> 4172.2789999999995
I want to make that perfectly clear

4169.04 --> 4174.56
that meteors are not literally the

4172.279 --> 4177.679
architecture

4174.56 --> 4180.080000000001
of the realm that is breaking up and

4177.679 --> 4182.06
falling in pieces on the ground

4180.08 --> 4184.66
that's not what that is it has to be

4182.06 --> 4184.660000000001
sediment

4186.859 --> 4192.7390000000005
something that basically builds up like

4189.92 --> 4196.1
plaque against it

4192.739 --> 4199.54
that would be the meteor

4196.1 --> 4199.54
once it comes loose

4199.64 --> 4202.660000000001
that's what I think

4205.78 --> 4218.379
[Music]

4230.01 --> 4236.99

[Music]

4275.86 --> 4281.32
traveler no and it's a really weird

4278.78 --> 4284.84
thing to ask because if you're gonna say

4281.32 --> 4285.62
does a looping nature influencing a

4284.84 --> 4287.54
thing

4285.62 --> 4290.3
then you do not understand the looping

4287.54 --> 4292.76
nature yeah

4290.3 --> 4295.159000000001
the looping nature cannot influence

4292.76 --> 4299.12
anything

4295.159 --> 4301.639999999999
it's not a physical effect it's a

4299.12 --> 4305.12
spatial effect

4301.64 --> 4308.84
yeah and space isn't anything the only

4305.12 --> 4312.5
thing space is is room

4308.84 --> 4315.6990000000005
for material and other things to fill it

4312.5 --> 4315.699
and do things

4315.739 --> 4320.32
looping nature cannot influence anything

4321.86 --> 4326.42
it's just it just is

4324.679 --> 4329.54
or it is

4326.42 --> 4331.219
whatever it turns out to be

4329.54 --> 4333.26
and if it's there it's not going to

4331.219 --> 4335.91
influence anything it's just it's just

4333.26 --> 4342.5
the layout it doesn't do anything

4335.91 --> 4344.86
[Music]

4342.5 --> 4348.86
foreign

4344.86 --> 4351.44
the only thing that basically the loop

4348.86 --> 4353.36
will have as an influence is that it

4351.44 --> 4356.678999999999
would enable

4353.36 --> 4356.679
there to be

4356.96 --> 4364.28
extremely fast motion in a singular line

4361.219 --> 4366.5
like potentially forever that is the

4364.28 --> 4369.08
only thing that it actually achieves

4366.5 --> 4371.239
that that really does stand up right

4369.08 --> 4375.08
because if there's a doom we're

4371.239 --> 4377.78
surrounded by a fishbowl yeah guess what

4375.08 --> 4381.14
you will never go

4377.78 --> 4383.96
like a a hundred thousand miles an hour

4381.14 --> 4387.14
or now a hundred thousand miles a second

4383.96 --> 4388.82
yeah even if you could somehow achieve

4387.14 --> 4391.159000000001
that without the material that's

4388.82 --> 4393.44
actually going that fast from completely

4391.159 --> 4396.5
buckling and all that

4393.44 --> 4399.739
you would not ever be able to go that

4396.5 --> 4403.179
speed ever why because there simply

4399.739 --> 4403.178999999999
isn't enough room

4403.239 --> 4410.239
to even build up that speed yeah yeah

4407.6 --> 4412.46
if there's a loop

4410.239 --> 4414.678999999999
guess what

4412.46 --> 4416.78
yeah

4414.679 --> 4418.58
guess what

4416.78 --> 4423.38
just go

4418.58 --> 4424.719
go and go and go and go and go and go

4423.38 --> 4429.76
and go go go go

4424.719 --> 4429.76
until you're literally a blurry line

4432.08 --> 4438.0199999999995
because there is an infinite amount of

4435.26 --> 4439.58
practical space available for that

4438.02 --> 4442.96
trajectory

4439.58 --> 4442.96
because there's a loop

4446.719 --> 4452.96
huh

4448.659 --> 4455.0
what use would that be practically none

4452.96 --> 4458.0
whatsoever what what's the point of

4455.0 --> 4461.36
being able to even go that fast

4458.0 --> 4463.58
when there's literally nowhere to go

4461.36 --> 4465.739
except for the same route over and over

4463.58 --> 4468.8
and over and over and over again really

4465.739 --> 4470.9
really fast what's the point besides

4468.8 --> 4473.08
just going fast there isn't any because

4470.9 --> 4476.36
there's literally nowhere else to go

4473.08 --> 4478.58
There's no practical purpose to have

4476.36 --> 4480.5
that that kind of speed

4478.58 --> 4483.0199999999995
but you could

4480.5 --> 4484.82
if it's looping if it's looping in a

4483.02 --> 4486.860000000001
straight line specific more specifically

4484.82 --> 4490.5199999999995
because if the loop is not entirely

4486.86 --> 4492.86
linear you got a problem

4490.52 --> 4494.06
right what if the loop is slightly

4492.86 --> 4497.36
arcing

4494.06 --> 4501.02
well I what you're going to go a hundred

4497.36 --> 4504.0199999999995
thousand miles a second in a corner oh

4501.02 --> 4506.0
no that doesn't work now does it oh no

4504.02 --> 4508.52
no no no the loop would have to be dead

4506.0 --> 4510.92
on in a straight line exactly like the

4508.52 --> 4514.1
train man station in The Matrix too

4510.92 --> 4517.58
or it would be completely pointless

4514.1 --> 4521.02
because you can't build up insane speeds

4517.58 --> 4521.0199999999995
not going in a straight line

4521.179 --> 4526.42
because the centripetal forces would

4523.159 --> 4529.48
then be added upon the very stability

4526.42 --> 4531.86
issues of the entire machine

4529.48 --> 4534.919999999999
and there's no way there's no way

4531.86 --> 4538.04
anything can go that fast

4534.92 --> 4540.86
in an arc there's no way

4538.04 --> 4541.74
like it's gonna disintegrate

4540.86 --> 4544.159
so

4541.74 --> 4548.26
[Music]

4544.159 --> 4548.259999999999
because there are maximum speed

4550.159 --> 4553.42
or allegedly

4558.86 --> 4563.199
I mean just watch Top Gun too

4564.92 --> 4570.56
this is not that that's really like oh

4567.14 --> 4572.780000000001
that that is very scientific but

4570.56 --> 4574.64
they sort of kind of do that there I

4572.78 --> 4578.48
mean they leave it open

4574.64 --> 4580.820000000001
after he's done his test pilot thing he

4578.48 --> 4583.459999999999
literally doesn't know where he is how

4580.82 --> 4586.639999999999
could that be could it be because he

4583.46 --> 4588.5
just went around the world really really

4586.64 --> 4592.52
fast and he doesn't know where he ends

4588.5 --> 4595.04
up oh really so he's going insane speeds

4592.52 --> 4598.040000000001
at a corner

4595.04 --> 4598.04
hmm

4598.219 --> 4604.64
seems impossible yeah

4601.58 --> 4609.219
if he's gone in a straight line

4604.64 --> 4609.219
yeah guess what could it just like

4609.58 --> 4614.5599999999995
shut up

4611.9 --> 4614.5599999999995
yeah yeah

4615.679 --> 4621.1990000000005
it's what I loved about that movie also

4618.08 --> 4622.04
because they leave it open they leave it

4621.199 --> 4624.739
open

4622.04 --> 4626.84
no [ __ ] about oh you have to go

4624.739 --> 4628.639999999999
slightly to notch when you're going that

4626.84 --> 4632.0
fast or you're going to shoot out of the

4628.64 --> 4634.280000000001
atmosphere [ __ ] none of that no it's

4632.0 --> 4636.38
just straight line how to keep this ride

4634.28 --> 4637.099999999999
stable while we're going in a straight

4636.38 --> 4641.12
line

4637.1 --> 4643.88
straight line not around the curve of

4641.12 --> 4645.5599999999995
Earth no straight line insane speed

4643.88 --> 4647.3
straight line you know how difficult

4645.56 --> 4648.8
that already is

4647.3 --> 4651.56
because what they show in the movie

4648.8 --> 4653.9800000000005
about it that's not far off I mean it's

4651.56 --> 4653.9800000000005
really like

4654.92 --> 4660.4
that happens

4657.38 --> 4663.86
when you're going those speeds it's

4660.4 --> 4664.94
extremely freaking dangerous

4663.86 --> 4667.759999999999
so

4664.94 --> 4669.86
I I like that scene from Top Gun too

4667.76 --> 4672.219
I like Top Gun 2 in general I thought it

4669.86 --> 4672.219
was awesome

4673.64 --> 4679.6990000000005
I gotta re-watch it like in a non-cam

4676.76 --> 4682.88
setup because I watched it like a movie

4679.699 --> 4683.839999999999
theater cam video of it but even that

4682.88 --> 4685.82
was awesome

4683.84 --> 4688.76
so anyway

4685.82 --> 4691.759999999999
so is there a maximum speed

4688.76 --> 4694.46
well theoretically no

4691.76 --> 4696.679
well according to Einstein it's the

4694.46 --> 4699.08
speed of light but that's [ __ ]

4696.679 --> 4703.159
because speed light doesn't have a speed

4699.08 --> 4704.84
so it's just a complete nonsense thing

4703.159 --> 4709.12
nothing could go faster than the speed

4704.84 --> 4709.12
of light but light doesn't have a speed

4709.67 --> 4713.95
[Music]

4711.56 --> 4720.029
you know

4713.95 --> 4720.0289999999995
[Music]

4720.739 --> 4723.159
okay

4732.38 --> 4739.12
what do you think about meteor creators

4735.26 --> 4739.12
being ancient Lakes

4748.28 --> 4754.639999999999
but what about meteor creators just

4750.8 --> 4757.58
being giant bombs

4754.64 --> 4761.0
what if meteor creators is just the

4757.58 --> 4763.159
fiction to kind of feel like shove under

4761.0 --> 4765.98
the carpet that there was basically just

4763.159 --> 4767.179
floating cities with giant nuclear death

4765.98 --> 4770.299999999999
rays

4767.179 --> 4774.32
that could literally just yeah blow up

4770.3 --> 4775.58
entire areas and leave a giant crater

4774.32 --> 4777.679
huh

4775.58 --> 4780.199
I mean you wonder where these giant

4777.679 --> 4784.1
craters come from well there used to be

4780.199 --> 4786.919999999999
really freaking big flying cities

4784.1 --> 4789.5
as in a flying City with like hundreds

4786.92 --> 4790.34
of thousands or millions of people on

4789.5 --> 4793.94
them

4790.34 --> 4796.719
with gigantic devices that would

4793.94 --> 4796.719
literally just

4799.82 --> 4803.48
those used to be there they're still in

4802.04 --> 4805.46
the records

4803.48 --> 4807.5599999999995
yeah

4805.46 --> 4809.78
so yeah that's gonna leave a giant

4807.56 --> 4811.76
crater so if you're wondering where do

4809.78 --> 4814.94
these giant craters come from well

4811.76 --> 4816.679
probably giant death Rays from flying

4814.94 --> 4818.36
cities

4816.679 --> 4820.28
I'm not joking

4818.36 --> 4822.82
it's more likely that that's actually

4820.28 --> 4822.82
the cause

4824.02 --> 4831.63
[Music]

4835.97 --> 4842.06
[Music]

4837.62 --> 4843.14
radio transmittations almost as fast as

4842.06 --> 4847.42
light

4843.14 --> 4847.42
I light doesn't have a speed

4847.52 --> 4851.02
that's just theoretical

4853.06 --> 4859.34
and I don't exactly know about radio

4856.28 --> 4863.599999999999
Transmissions it's weird they say it's

4859.34 --> 4866.179
like I don't see it exactly as light

4863.6 --> 4867.9800000000005
it doesn't really seem to act that much

4866.179 --> 4871.52
like light it's weird

4867.98 --> 4873.5599999999995
I'm a little confused about it

4871.52 --> 4876.860000000001
but

4873.56 --> 4880.780000000001
light is pretty much instantaneous and

4876.86 --> 4880.78
Well Radio Transmissions aren't

4881.36 --> 4887.719
they have a delay so apparently they do

4885.38 --> 4888.8
have a speed somehow but it's really

4887.719 --> 4891.999
freaking weird

4888.8 --> 4891.999
[Music]

4892.699 --> 4898.339999999999
and I'm sure you can calculate and

4896.179 --> 4900.9800000000005
predict exactly what's going to happen

4898.34 --> 4903.5
and so your model is all correct oh what

4900.98 --> 4905.599999999999
are you what are you hassling about this

4903.5 --> 4909.62
nonsense Arwin

4905.6 --> 4912.38
don't you know I can calculate it see so

4909.62 --> 4914.659
that means our stupid model assumptions

4912.38 --> 4916.76
are correct and Lloyd has a speed after

4914.659 --> 4919.12
all blah because it's the same thing as

4916.76 --> 4921.5
radio because it's all one thing and

4919.12 --> 4923.48
yeah whatever

4921.5 --> 4925.76
I don't know light doesn't seem to

4923.48 --> 4928.759999999999
really have a speed

4925.76 --> 4930.9800000000005
and as soon as you'd like get the

4928.76 --> 4934.400000000001
official claims about it under the loop

4930.98 --> 4938.178999999999
it just all falls apart

4934.4 --> 4941.92
and I don't know if radio is really like

4938.179 --> 4944.78
the same Spectrum as light I don't know

4941.92 --> 4947.36
I don't think so I think that a whole

4944.78 --> 4950.36
bunch of things and effects that have

4947.36 --> 4951.92
been discovered and developed through

4950.36 --> 4954.86
engineering

4951.92 --> 4956.84
that some scientists scored boys

4954.86 --> 4959.0
basically came together and insisted

4956.84 --> 4961.400000000001
like oh it's all one thing it's all one

4959.0 --> 4964.46
thing The Theory of Everything we're the

4961.4 --> 4966.259999999999
ultimate special boy Geniuses we figured

4964.46 --> 4968.6
out it's all one thing and we're look

4966.26 --> 4970.58
it's one Spectrum you see you could just

4968.6 --> 4972.8
put it there and there and there and it

4970.58 --> 4975.44
fits don't think about it too hard don't

4972.8 --> 4977.42
actually study the separate phenomena

4975.44 --> 4979.46
it's just it's the same thing it's all

4977.42 --> 4981.4400000000005
one Spectrum yeah I think that's where

4979.46 --> 4984.92
that [ __ ] came from

4981.44 --> 4987.62
I don't think it is the same thing

4984.92 --> 4989.78
the electromagnetic radiation yeah yeah

4987.62 --> 4992.739
I don't even think that light is

4989.78 --> 4992.739
electromagnetic

4993.86 --> 4998.86
I don't think it is

4995.78 --> 4998.86
it's not that

4998.96 --> 5003.64
when they say electromagnetic spectrum I

5001.84 --> 5007.860000000001
think that's science fiction

5003.64 --> 5007.860000000001
I think they literally made it up

5010.719 --> 5015.4
I think it's just like a saying that's

5013.06 --> 5018.04
actually born out of this math

5015.4 --> 5021.299999999999
unification

5018.04 --> 5021.3
which isn't real

5028.12 --> 5033.099999999999
all right

5030.159 --> 5035.94
but there is more for me to figure out

5033.1 --> 5035.9400000000005
concerning that

5035.98 --> 5040.12
but I've always had strong suspicions

5038.44 --> 5043.96
like there's something wrong with this

5040.12 --> 5047.92
like no radio signals all that and light

5043.96 --> 5050.7390000000005
they're just not the same

5047.92 --> 5052.36
they're just not

5050.739 --> 5053.86
they're not the same thing they're not

5052.36 --> 5055.839999999999
the same substance they're not the same

5053.86 --> 5057.58
effect

5055.84 --> 5060.9400000000005
yeah

5057.58 --> 5063.12
I mean you can't turn a lamp into a

5060.94 --> 5063.12
radio

5066.1 --> 5071.38
right and I'm pretty sure that you can't

5068.56 --> 5073.8
use like a radio transmitter to create

5071.38 --> 5073.8
light

5074.38 --> 5076.9800000000005
so

5077.92 --> 5082.2390000000005
I think it's kind of just the

5079.84 --> 5084.76
reification board out of this

5082.239 --> 5087.58
mathematical unification

5084.76 --> 5090.9400000000005
that they did to say that's all one

5087.58 --> 5093.4
thing oh really look the math works out

5090.94 --> 5096.12
yeah right

5093.4 --> 5096.12
whatever

5096.92 --> 5101.079
[Music]

5103.32 --> 5109.679
those like vimanas is that what their

5106.719 --> 5109.679
flying cities are called

5112.239 --> 5117.299999999999
I'd never remember the names I just call

5114.4 --> 5117.299999999999
them flying cities

5129.76 --> 5134.400000000001
what do you think like has it doesn't

5132.159 --> 5139.299999999999
have speeds that's where it's it doesn't

5134.4 --> 5141.5199999999995
light does not have speed

5139.3 --> 5143.9800000000005
immeasurable

5141.52 --> 5147.120000000001
you literally cannot measure it

5143.98 --> 5147.12
it doesn't have a speed

5147.82 --> 5152.44
the only times that any kind of

5150.1 --> 5154.5
numerology and numbers have come out of

5152.44 --> 5157.719
it is all been

5154.5 --> 5161.02
mathematically extrapolated

5157.719 --> 5163.84
none of it is actually proven Brian made

5161.02 --> 5166.06
a whole case about this Brighton

5163.84 --> 5168.82
Brian's logic

5166.06 --> 5173.139
it was right

5168.82 --> 5176.159
a lot of this speed of light is actually

5173.139 --> 5176.159000000001
science fiction

5176.26 --> 5181.179
there's no singular

5178.3 --> 5184.4800000000005
speed of light measurement that has ever

5181.179 --> 5188.7390000000005
been done right they've only ever like

5184.48 --> 5191.5
attempt it two-way speed alike

5188.739 --> 5194.08
and none of it makes sense

5191.5 --> 5196.36
there's literally no solid proof that

5194.08 --> 5200.04
light has a speed

5196.36 --> 5203.739
it's not confirmed there's like weird

5200.04 --> 5206.08
incidences and phenomena

5203.739 --> 5211.178999999999
like observations that might be

5206.08 --> 5214.3
perceived but they don't actually prove

5211.179 --> 5216.76
that light has a speed it's just really

5214.3 --> 5220.42
bizarre things

5216.76 --> 5223.56
like the extremely uh

5220.42 --> 5226.78
condensed camera where they take like

5223.56 --> 5229.42
yeah slow-mo camera that is so insanely

5226.78 --> 5230.44
slow it's just surreal and then they try

5229.42 --> 5232.84
to

5230.44 --> 5236.919999999999
measure like

5232.84 --> 5238.12
a quanta of light being Unleashed and

5236.92 --> 5241.4800000000005
then they thought that they could

5238.12 --> 5244.42
actually see it move throughout the time

5241.48 --> 5247.839999999999
right and that's like oh look at this oh

5244.42 --> 5251.02
see I can see it I can see it move so

5247.84 --> 5253.0
that means it has to have a speed see

5251.02 --> 5256.179
it's inference inference inference

5253.0 --> 5258.58
inference inference no proof inference

5256.179 --> 5262.06
only inference yeah

5258.58 --> 5265.84
it's the math way it's how they do it

5262.06 --> 5268.719
that video exists I know I've seen it

5265.84 --> 5271.659000000001
and I've argued it it doesn't prove

5268.719 --> 5274.0
anything though yeah

5271.659 --> 5277.42
it doesn't

5274.0 --> 5280.179
it's just a weird aberrant observation

5277.42 --> 5282.28
it doesn't actually prove light has a

5280.179 --> 5284.9800000000005
speed or that it even travels it doesn't

5282.28 --> 5286.84
prove that can you wrap your mind around

5284.98 --> 5289.678999999999
that

5286.84 --> 5289.679
can ya

5292.719 --> 5297.94
what would it take for me to be

5295.179 --> 5298.719
convinced a measurement of the speed of

5297.94 --> 5302.04
light

5298.719 --> 5302.04
that is consistent

5303.219 --> 5310.179
and scientifically repeatable how about

5306.699 --> 5312.82
that yeah and why the [ __ ] would you ask

5310.179 --> 5315.159
anybody what would it take you to be

5312.82 --> 5318.179
convinced what kind of a weird ass

5315.159 --> 5318.179
question is that

5324.4 --> 5327.299999999999
seriously

5327.46 --> 5331.6
what would it take well it's like what

5329.92 --> 5334.2390000000005
would it take for you to be convinced

5331.6 --> 5336.280000000001
that the Earth is a ball well how about

5334.239 --> 5338.0199999999995
the Earth being a ball

5336.28 --> 5340.3
what would it take for you to be

5338.02 --> 5342.820000000001
convinced that light has a speed well

5340.3 --> 5343.900000000001
that it actually had a speed how about

5342.82 --> 5348.219
that

5343.9 --> 5349.9
yeah things actually being real is what

5348.219 --> 5351.219
what it would take for me to be

5349.9 --> 5353.0199999999995
convinced

5351.219 --> 5353.92
that's why I'm not convinced because it

5353.02 --> 5356.38
isn't

5353.92 --> 5359.1
because if it were I would already be

5356.38 --> 5359.1
convinced

5361.59 --> 5366.749
[Music]

5366.88 --> 5372.34
uh

5369.159 --> 5374.62
so yeah have fun with your little weird

5372.34 --> 5376.860000000001
aberrant video that doesn't prove

5374.62 --> 5376.86
anything

5377.98 --> 5383.0199999999995
yeah

5378.94 --> 5386.0199999999995
but hey you can infer you can infer the

5383.02 --> 5387.76
[ __ ] out of it that's all you'll ever be

5386.02 --> 5390.219
able to do with it because you can't

5387.76 --> 5392.7390000000005
measure it

5390.219 --> 5395.26
it has not been measured if it was

5392.739 --> 5397.718999999999
measurable then that would have been

5395.26 --> 5399.76
done it would now be admitted to the

5397.719 --> 5402.34
official record

5399.76 --> 5404.34
of physics

5402.34 --> 5406.78
and universities

5404.34 --> 5409.2390000000005
everything it would be everywhere it

5406.78 --> 5412.42
would be in all the literature but it

5409.239 --> 5414.339999999999
isn't because you can't because light

5412.42 --> 5417.46
doesn't have a speed

5414.34 --> 5419.139
but you can most certainly create weird

5417.46 --> 5422.9800000000005
little phenomenon

5419.139 --> 5425.32
with super high speed camera if you want

5422.98 --> 5427.919999999999
yeah you can have very weird sightings

5425.32 --> 5431.259999999999
and then make a lot of inferenced

5427.92 --> 5433.12
conclusions from that sure you can it

5431.26 --> 5434.679
doesn't prove it though it doesn't

5433.12 --> 5437.5
actually prove light-headed speed

5434.679 --> 5439.32
because if it would

5437.5 --> 5442.3
then there would be

5439.32 --> 5445.0599999999995
elaboration upon that proof and it would

5442.3 --> 5449.6990000000005
now be admitted to let's just say the

5445.06 --> 5449.6990000000005
Hall of Records for physics and it isn't

5451.98 --> 5457.839999999999
no no he wasn't where the [ __ ] are you

5455.44 --> 5459.879999999999
getting there

5457.84 --> 5463.1990000000005

5459.88 --> 5463.1990000000005
like this dude

5463.98 --> 5467.24

holy [ __ ] I just looked that up

you cannot be serious

5527.08 --> 5533.5
you cannot be serious dude

5530.5 --> 5537.58
look at this [ __ ]

5533.5 --> 5542.08
you know how we proved it

5537.58 --> 5544.0
through astronomy garbage

5542.08 --> 5546.9
yeah

5544.0 --> 5546.9
look at that

5547.6 --> 5553.3
look at that

5550.659 --> 5555.58
is this astronomy garbage you can't

5553.3 --> 5558.54
actually be expecting that we're gonna

5555.58 --> 5562.78
take that as

5558.54 --> 5566.08
physical in the world real measurement

5562.78 --> 5567.46
based evidence of light you cannot be

5566.08 --> 5571.739
serious man

5567.46 --> 5571.7390000000005
you cannot be serious

5575.98 --> 5579.94
oh we have spoken over Skype like three

5577.96 --> 5581.62
no I forgot

5579.94 --> 5583.54
look

5581.62 --> 5588.0
it's [ __ ]

5583.54 --> 5588.0
do you understand that it's [ __ ]

5588.28 --> 5592.659
do you understand

5590.86 --> 5595.839999999999
yeah

5592.659 --> 5599.98
he didn't measure [ __ ]

5595.84 --> 5604.02
he calculated a bunch of garbage based

5599.98 --> 5608.5
on assumptions within astronomy

5604.02 --> 5611.26
how the [ __ ] is that physics evidence

5608.5 --> 5614.139
you cannot be serious I mean do I have

5611.26 --> 5615.58
to pull out the housekeeping question

5614.139 --> 5618.58
foreign

5615.58 --> 5618.58
evidence

5619.54 --> 5624.96
within the fields of astronomy

5622.139 --> 5628.900000000001
astrophysics or cosmology

5624.96 --> 5630.1
seriously yeah because this little link

5628.9 --> 5634.799999999999
here

5630.1 --> 5634.8
definitely falls under astronomy

5637.48 --> 5641.0199999999995
yeah

5638.679 --> 5644.52
you respect that I think you're [ __ ]

5641.02 --> 5644.52
yeah yeah okay that's good

5645.699 --> 5652.48
you don't have to care about it

5647.94 --> 5656.44
but you know it was you that just gave

5652.48 --> 5659.199
me this evidence for the measurement of

5656.44 --> 5660.219
a speed of light referencing to some

5659.199 --> 5664.0599999999995
freaking

5660.219 --> 5666.639
Renaissance astronomer who calculated

5664.06 --> 5669.580000000001
the supposed speed of light based on

5666.639 --> 5672.159000000001
presuppositions I mean this is pathetic

5669.58 --> 5675.1
dude pathetic

5672.159 --> 5678.36
yeah this is not about me thinking

5675.1 --> 5681.159000000001
you're [ __ ] this is about you

5678.36 --> 5685.239
thinking that something that is

5681.159 --> 5687.54
literally provably [ __ ] is valid

5685.239 --> 5687.54
evidence

5687.88 --> 5690.900000000001
that's what that's about

5691.42 --> 5696.639
right isn't instantaneous yeah it is

5694.719 --> 5698.55
light does not travel it is

5696.639 --> 5702.1
instantaneous

5698.55 --> 5702.1

5710.62 --> 5713.62

5721.92 --> 5726.159
it's hilarious and all that but

5724.36 --> 5729.82
seriously I thought he was actually

5726.159 --> 5732.339999999999
gonna bring forth some guy that did some

5729.82 --> 5734.259999999999
apparatus and then actually like yeah we

5732.34 --> 5736.12
figured out that it is not instantaneous

5734.26 --> 5738.58
it's that speed because he had that

5736.12 --> 5741.88
trajectory and it just took this long

5738.58 --> 5744.76
but no it it wasn't even that it was

5741.88 --> 5748.4800000000005
just some stupid astronomer calculation

5744.76 --> 5751.4800000000005
based on presuppositions I mean

5748.48 --> 5754.9
I'm freaking disappointed

5751.48 --> 5758.339999999999
but it's also hilarious and so typical

5754.9 --> 5758.339999999999
that that just happened

[Music]

5762.4 --> 5766.839999999999

5764.08 --> 5769.96
I don't care what it says I'd like to

5766.84 --> 5773.679
see some evidence and there isn't any

5769.96 --> 5777.34
except for stupid astronomy based free

5773.679 --> 5779.7390000000005
suppositional calculations

5777.34 --> 5782.58
safe to say that that's not

5779.739 --> 5785.94
valid naturally occurring

5782.58 --> 5785.94
phenomenon-based evidence

5789.08 --> 5792.97
[Music]

5793.239 --> 5798.459999999999
sorry it's a what is question anyway the

5796.719 --> 5802.7390000000005
point is it doesn't prove anything it's

5798.46 --> 5802.7390000000005
just stupid presuppositional nonsense

5810.659 --> 5814.679
right woodworking gummy bear

5819.28 --> 5824.759999999999
hey hello King Arthur

5821.62 --> 5824.76
new sup cool

5824.8 --> 5829.179
I think the electromagnetic spectrum is

5827.199 --> 5832.419999999999
real or man's fabrication it's a man

5829.179 --> 5836.5
fabrication and it's not real

5832.42 --> 5839.38
it's the unification of all things it's

5836.5 --> 5843.04
garbage I mean the electromagnetic

5839.38 --> 5845.92
spectrum is about as scientific

5843.04 --> 5847.719
as energy

5845.92 --> 5851.02
yeah

5847.719 --> 5852.34
energy is not scientific energy is a

5851.02 --> 5855.6990000000005
concept

5852.34 --> 5858.52
that unifies several different elements

5855.699 --> 5862.599999999999
within physics and then turns them into

5858.52 --> 5865.179
a singular thing that sort of sometimes

5862.6 --> 5866.8
works out mathematically a lot of the

5865.179 --> 5869.9800000000005
times it doesn't though

5866.8 --> 5873.34
but it's a very convenient convention

5869.98 --> 5875.98
yeah energy and people use it I mean

5873.34 --> 5878.26
even I use it

5875.98 --> 5881.0199999999995
but it doesn't make it real it doesn't

5878.26 --> 5883.62
make it an actual physics based

5881.02 --> 5883.620000000001
substance

5887.5 --> 5893.139
right and yeah same goes for the

5890.56 --> 5895.4800000000005
electromagnetic spectrum it's just they

5893.139 --> 5897.639
had these different things and then they

5895.48 --> 5899.919999999999
thought oh we can sort of put this

5897.639 --> 5903.34
together and it makes it one thing oh

5899.92 --> 5906.76
see we finally solve this puzzle no no

5903.34 --> 5909.76
you literally created that puzzle with

5906.76 --> 5913.06
your longing your hunger to find

5909.76 --> 5915.92
unification and God within science so he

5913.06 --> 5919.749000000001
can find your god without God

5915.92 --> 5919.749
[Music]

5922.179 --> 5925.12
yeah that's what it is they're trying to

5923.739 --> 5927.36
find God

5925.12 --> 5929.96
in science

5927.36 --> 5932.04
excluding God

5929.96 --> 5934.36
[Music]

5932.04 --> 5936.82
because it doesn't matter to them

5934.36 --> 5939.94
whether it's true or not they just have

5936.82 --> 5942.34
to move towards that iconification right

5939.94 --> 5944.0199999999995
has to be unified because we have to be

5942.34 --> 5945.46
right because we are scientists and we

5944.02 --> 5948.280000000001
don't believe in God

5945.46 --> 5950.86
so it has to be unified because we have

5948.28 --> 5952.9
to be right and we always do things like

5950.86 --> 5955.54
this we it's all one right it's all one

5952.9 --> 5957.82
but not God no no it's the material it's

5955.54 --> 5960.639
all one thing one spectrum of everything

5957.82 --> 5962.94
it's all one thing but it's not God

5960.639 --> 5962.9400000000005
though

5963.88 --> 5970.12
yeah so that they can feel they are God

5967.179 --> 5972.6
because they understand how it's all one

5970.12 --> 5975.94
thing it's all literally just them

5972.6 --> 5978.639
desperately trying to put on that mantle

5975.94 --> 5980.919999999999
of being the Creator through their

5978.639 --> 5982.659000000001
understanding but they're constantly

5980.92 --> 5986.34
delusional

5982.659 --> 5989.739
and make shortcuts and choose for

5986.34 --> 5992.26
convenient little tricks to manipulate

5989.739 --> 5994.48
to make themselves seem more imposing

5992.26 --> 5997.06
rather than pursuing the long-term

5994.48 --> 5999.4
fractal truth of things

5997.06 --> 6001.620000000001
and that's what's happened with science

5999.4 --> 6003.719
in general and it happened like a

6001.62 --> 6005.699
hundred years ago already I mean this

6003.719 --> 6007.86
corruption cycle that we're getting

6005.699 --> 6008.78
exposed to now in the world with

6007.86 --> 6012.12
supposed

6008.78 --> 6015.239
science yeah

6012.12 --> 6019.739
that's been going on for quite a while I

6015.239 --> 6021.718999999999
mean this is like the end phase of the

6019.739 --> 6025.759999999999
entire corruption cycle that's been

6021.719 --> 6025.76
going for over a hundred years

6025.8 --> 6031.5
the corruption was there

6028.5 --> 6034.26
like when I was a kid and I wanted to do

6031.5 --> 6036.96
science I bumped into the corruption

6034.26 --> 6039.96
that even though I couldn't describe it

6036.96 --> 6041.88
I could feel it

6039.96 --> 6045.0
it's corrupted

6041.88 --> 6048.32
the spirit of it what the people do

6045.0 --> 6048.32
there is corrupted

6049.98 --> 6057.62
they care less about truth and more

6052.92 --> 6057.62
about seeming like an authority

6057.659 --> 6061.0599999999995
that's what's happened to the spirit of

6060.719 --> 6074.029
science

6061.06 --> 6074.029
[Music]

6074.34 --> 6077.88
whoa

6075.54 --> 6080.46
man

6077.88 --> 6081.719
I can't believe it's already three

6080.46 --> 6083.76
o'clock

6081.719 --> 6086.54
time has flown it's been a very

6083.76 --> 6086.54
interesting show

6087.96 --> 6092.84
why did God create scientists well why

6090.719 --> 6095.52
does God create all the horrible

6092.84 --> 6097.4400000000005
horrible things in the world well

6095.52 --> 6100.38
there's only one reason and that's to

6097.44 --> 6102.599999999999
test you because if you cannot

6100.38 --> 6105.4800000000005
distinguish what is horrible and what is

6102.6 --> 6106.9800000000005
not that nothing means anything and it's

6105.48 --> 6112.159
all pointless

6106.98 --> 6116.699
so yeah God puts horrifying terrible

6112.159 --> 6120.42
torturous monstrous suicide driving evil

6116.699 --> 6123.299999999999
in the world to test you if you cannot

6120.42 --> 6125.83
[ __ ] deal with that it's your dumbass

6123.3 --> 6127.26
issue just means you're weak

6125.83 --> 6129.96
[Music]

6127.26 --> 6132.6
yeah so that's why God created

6129.96 --> 6136.08
scientists

6132.6 --> 6140.280000000001
but yeah I mean the original idea of a

6136.08 --> 6142.86
scientist is basically a noble

6140.28 --> 6146.699
philosopher

6142.86 --> 6149.759999999999
that follows strict discipline that's

6146.699 --> 6152.46
really what a scientist is with this

6149.76 --> 6155.04
garbage that it is now it's more like

6152.46 --> 6157.619
it's become like a a technobabble

6155.04 --> 6159.56
mechanical priesthood yeah has nothing

6157.619 --> 6162.599999999999
to do with the original

6159.56 --> 6165.4800000000005
conception of the scientific method

6162.6 --> 6167.1
and what the people that chose that path

6165.48 --> 6169.86
did with it

6167.1 --> 6172.9400000000005
they were real scientists they were all

6169.86 --> 6176.28
about the truth they would die

6172.94 --> 6178.32
for the truth as they discovered do you

6176.28 --> 6182.88
understand what that means not just

6178.32 --> 6186.239
virtue signal those people would die for

6182.88 --> 6189.179
the truth yeah that's dedication that's

6186.239 --> 6191.28
real that's a real scientist you have

6189.179 --> 6193.86
somebody who cares more about the truth

6191.28 --> 6196.0199999999995
than their life

6193.86 --> 6199.139
that's a scientist do you think these

6196.02 --> 6201.1990000000005
numpty [ __ ] Wizards out there now

6199.139 --> 6204.6
that they die

6201.199 --> 6207.54
for the truth or anything no they [ __ ]

6204.6 --> 6208.88
their pants they'd suck a dick they'd do

6207.54 --> 6211.5
anything

6208.88 --> 6213.78
maximum humiliation if they could just

6211.5 --> 6215.34
keep your precious little money yeah

6213.78 --> 6218.94
because that's what they're about their

6215.34 --> 6221.46
monies of their money priests

6218.94 --> 6224.099999999999
techno babbling money priests they have

6221.46 --> 6229.219
nothing to do with science or the

6224.1 --> 6229.219
original Spirit of science nothing

6230.639 --> 6235.5
anyway I am rounding out the show now

6232.679 --> 6237.2390000000005
the yeah it was great

6235.5 --> 6239.46
only thing missing is a good PayPal

6237.239 --> 6241.799999999999
donation

6239.46 --> 6244.679
maybe I can still get that I really hope

6241.8 --> 6246.119000000001
so anyway thanks everyone for coming I

6244.679 --> 6247.679

6251.28 --> 6255.36
silence but after that things picked up

6253.32 --> 6256.86
quickly and had some interesting uh

6255.36 --> 6260.46

on a Thursday and I'm gonna join the

6307.38 --> 6312.659000000001
Flat Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley
