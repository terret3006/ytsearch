5.96 --> 15.149999999999999
hello and welcome back to the flat earth

10.05 --> 18.33
early-bird show number 585 B yeah my

15.15 --> 20.67
computer crashed and my internet got

18.33 --> 22.409999999999997
blocked at the same time like I got a

20.67 --> 25.5
blue screen of death and my internet I

22.41 --> 28.529
had to reset like what the right so that

25.5 --> 33.18
took a bit but I'm back for the second

28.529 --> 35.37
half of this show very weird

33.18 --> 37.59
this never happened like that before but

35.37 --> 39.54
this is especially like the blue screen

37.59 --> 43.71
that like never happens I don't know

39.54 --> 49.5
where that came from very weird but I'm

43.71 --> 55.879000000000005
not worried maybe I'll just clean up my

49.5 --> 59.66
computer some after this right so anyway

55.879 --> 59.66
what were we talking about

68.71 --> 77.899
see oh yeah yeah I was basically

72.049 --> 82.43
explaining about cancer how it can

77.899 --> 87.789
respond to situations and misery bear

82.43 --> 87.789
put down some really good facts about it

88.09 --> 95.84
based on German new medicine research

93.46 --> 97.42899999999999
because it has been researched the

95.84 --> 99.85000000000001
German new medicine is not just some

97.429 --> 102.85000000000001
vague concepts all been tested

99.85 --> 102.85
meticulously

102.94 --> 113.14
real-life subjects on a voluntary basis

107.709 --> 113.14
very strict so yeah

126.32 --> 131.17
but still getting through

133.09 --> 139.29
all right if my video was still stuck to

136.45 --> 139.29
the previous one

145.94 --> 150.43
right now that definitely caught me off

148.4 --> 150.43
guard

155.68 --> 158.86
[Applause]

171.35 --> 174.48999999999998
[Music]

178.91 --> 184.25
all right anyway yeah I was watching

181.64 --> 187.13
since I named the title bear fruit not

184.25 --> 190.85
blood definitely inspired him what own

187.13 --> 194.12
Benjamin was doing and eventually like

190.85 --> 197.2
that came out and it's really important

194.12 --> 201.20000000000002
like especially in the face of all the

197.2 --> 204.79999999999998
the crazy darkness that's going on out

201.2 --> 208.07
there the agitation everywhere it's very

204.8 --> 212.63000000000002
important to not to yet to either squirt

208.07 --> 214.16
or get distracted by wanting something

212.63 --> 216.95
out of the way now you've got to figure

214.16 --> 222.44
out how to produce something in between

216.95 --> 226.28
that will stand it that'll survive it

222.44 --> 227.06
and I thought I was a really good

226.28 --> 230.69
concept

227.06 --> 232.99
oh my chat is stuck woo thanks for

230.69 --> 232.99
telling me

238.01 --> 245.09
what

240.59 --> 250.31
okay that was unexpected all right still

245.09 --> 258.26
stuck to the olds chat I thought I would

250.31 --> 260.29
move on but apparently not ooh what is

258.26 --> 260.28999999999996
this

262.66 --> 269.73
oh wait this right I know what's going

267.52 --> 269.72999999999996
on

273.79 --> 279.49
tell my computer reset it the other chat

277.45 --> 285.42
from the previous hangout still popped

279.49 --> 291.63
up and I linked to that so here comes

285.42 --> 291.63
the correct one and we're back right

294.05 --> 297.17900000000003
[Music]

298.29 --> 311.98
thanks for pointing that out

300.07 --> 316.44
tiny wubble see bus in the house what

311.98 --> 316.44
does that mean OC bus

325.43 --> 329.749
but anyway hello John John Mack

337.689 --> 343.809
a hardware failure yes sure but I don't

340.539 --> 345.81899999999996
know what cost analogy so maybe there

343.809 --> 349.59900000000005
was kind of like a weird electrical

345.819 --> 353.439
feedback loop happening or something

349.599 --> 356.55899999999997
through the electric system and that it

353.439 --> 359.559
caused my internet to basically cut out

356.559 --> 362.709
and my computer - yeah do something

359.559 --> 363.54900000000004
weird yeah but I don't know where that's

362.709 --> 371.11
coming from

363.549 --> 376.839
Hey Brian's logic O'Brien oh yeah yeah

371.11 --> 380.769
yeah Brian me and chocolate yesterday a

376.839 --> 383.919
really good conversation afterward after

380.769 --> 386.379
the show had ended the after show and we

383.919 --> 387.60999999999996
came up kind of or I came up with an

386.379 --> 391.23900000000003
idea but I thought it was

387.61 --> 394.629
yeah worthy cuz every time maybe it's

391.239 --> 396.99899999999997
just me maybe it's just our win but I

394.629 --> 401.379
don't think so because I thought that

396.999 --> 403.92900000000003
chocolate and Ryan really did get the

401.379 --> 407.559
issue that I have with the seasons and

403.929 --> 412.62899999999996
how that's supposed to work how it's

407.559 --> 415.92900000000003
supposed to work on a ball and then what

412.629 --> 418.629
half flat earth are so far said on the

415.929 --> 421.989
reasoning behind how it's supposed to

418.629 --> 425.459
work I don't know the disc which is kind

421.989 --> 428.93899999999996
of the closest yeah model or well just

425.459 --> 431.469
to figure out what that really is

428.939 --> 436.65900000000005
because like even in a rectangular

431.469 --> 439.149
looping concept that I use and with the

436.659 --> 441.30899999999997
celestial bodies Oh being holographic

439.149 --> 446.229
personal fourth dimensional as one could

441.309 --> 452.619
say now right like I still don't

446.229 --> 454.839
understand how there could be such

452.619 --> 459.869
radical temperature differences in the

454.839 --> 461.66
same container that's something that

459.869 --> 465.26000000000005
like

461.66 --> 468.71000000000004
I don't really understand like the only

465.26 --> 470.81
reason I could think of is like if there

468.71 --> 473.98999999999995
is if it is more like a microwave

470.81 --> 476.27
induced kind of energy it's just

473.99 --> 479.93
literally the presence just hits

476.27 --> 482.39
everything up and then if it's not all

479.93 --> 487.43
heated up then it will all start to

482.39 --> 489.56
freeze really rapidly so maybe yeah

487.43 --> 492.02
having good seasons you know is much

489.56 --> 495.67
more Sun dependent than we even realized

492.02 --> 502.7
like that maybe that is a start

495.67 --> 510.35
for me to really get a logical model out

502.7 --> 512.06
of it for the seasons so yeah that

510.35 --> 515.45
that's what we were talking about and

512.06 --> 518.06
yeah well chocolates not on this early

515.45 --> 521.0200000000001
it would be just like half sleep or

518.06 --> 525.05
something anyway it's at work probably

521.02 --> 527.56
but yeah maybe I'm gonna do a another

525.05 --> 530.87
night I'll show about this at some point

527.56 --> 533.3199999999999
soon as i yeah muster a little bit more

530.87 --> 533.32
strength

540.96 --> 553.0400000000001
[Music]

542.63 --> 557.27
being dot-com is down okay they're

553.04 --> 559.78
resetting the internet there Mandela

557.27 --> 565.6899999999999
affecting it into something else

559.78 --> 565.6899999999999
maybe I'm just blabbering now

567.28 --> 570.39
[Music]

572.61 --> 582.45
all right how good is the Bing search

575.13 --> 584.279
engine these days is there any good or

582.45 --> 588.149
is it just the same as Google pretty

584.279 --> 591.899
much does it actually you more honest

588.149 --> 593.99
non politicized search results I don't

591.899 --> 593.99
know

597.07 --> 601.74
it was from Microsoft anyway I think

602.1 --> 607.259
okay you say it's better

604.259 --> 607.259
mm-hmm

613.13 --> 618.51
okay well you know what maybe I should

615.57 --> 621.36
try that again it's just that I've

618.51 --> 624.03
gotten used to Google and it has gotten

621.36 --> 627.0600000000001
used to me and unfortunately that kind

624.03 --> 630.6
of keeps me stuck to it a little extra

627.06 --> 639.39
and yeah I use YouTube I've kind of

630.6 --> 642.03
really stuck to Google but yeah I've

639.39 --> 646.6999999999999
never been a great search or using

642.03 --> 649.26
search engines anyway maybe I should

646.7 --> 655.4100000000001
really learn that skill I used to be

649.26 --> 658.05
pretty okay at it back in the day but I

655.41 --> 661.38
used Google back then and it was really

658.05 --> 664.77
good and the amount of censoring that it

661.38 --> 668.39
did back then was very minor they were

664.77 --> 668.39
in relation to what it is now

680.49 --> 686.19
paid for results right more colored okay

700.59 --> 705.74
anyway yeah you know what I'll try it

702.84 --> 705.74
again sometime

714.34 --> 719.7800000000001
[Music]

715.98 --> 719.78
but anyway thanks for the tips

739.54 --> 748.769
yeah exactly more colored yeah that yeah

744.519 --> 752.019
and I was in the beginning I used it I

748.769 --> 754.18
was able to use it very well but it is

752.019 --> 756.91
just it has changed and changed and

754.18 --> 759.0889999999999
changed and it's nothing like what it

756.91 --> 759.0889999999999
was

781.04 --> 795.92
yeah I thought that as well over moco

785.11 --> 799.8100000000001
it's like like no ye know and if he were

795.92 --> 799.81
we figure that out soon enough

799.87 --> 805.8100000000001
but I don't think so I don't think that

802.67 --> 805.81
guy ever get sick

806.44 --> 816.94
all right anyway yep control indeed

813.76 --> 816.9399999999999
[Music]

828.709 --> 836.63
advancing reality in the world we see

832.74 --> 836.63
with our eyeballs okey-dokey

862.84 --> 867.1600000000001
[Music]

864.21 --> 871.38
why do people make stuff up well just to

867.16 --> 874.03
distract from whatever is it going on oh

871.38 --> 877.54
yeah yeah Brian's logic guys I did see

874.03 --> 881.56
that I did I did already talked about

877.54 --> 884.86
this in the in the first half I thought

881.56 --> 890.4399999999999
it was hilarious I thought that Toni

884.86 --> 892.9300000000001
stood his ground really well although I

890.44 --> 896.2600000000001
did feel almost like I needed needed to

892.93 --> 898.93
like just hammer it down some extra

896.26 --> 903.85
because he was being typically careful a

898.93 --> 905.9499999999999
lot well up to a certain point because

903.85 --> 908.14
eventually like like what the fight the

905.95 --> 910.75
flat earth was just learning I was just

908.14 --> 912.73
getting so idiotic and he was really

910.75 --> 920.44
trying to Gaslight everything

912.73 --> 922.57
it's absolutely preposterous like he

920.44 --> 923.8900000000001
literally at some point just doesn't

922.57 --> 925.96
even understand what the hell he's

923.89 --> 928.5699999999999
saying if you would ask him to explain

925.96 --> 933.63
just something he was saying he would

928.57 --> 939.75
know how it was just completely

933.63 --> 939.75
blabbering into oblivion at the end

949.56 --> 956.329
yeah that's right dank yeah me too but

952.74 --> 959.879
hey with when Tony's there to at least

956.329 --> 964.8889999999999
speak some sensibility in between that

959.879 --> 967.61
kind of does make it a ride makes it

964.889 --> 967.61
more tenable

969.71 --> 972.859
[Music]

983.35 --> 989.58
I don't know many you think they're busy

990.53 --> 993.7099999999999
[Music]

998.38 --> 1001.57
[Music]

1005.62 --> 1010.48
and yeah exactly Brian's logic well-set

1008.8 --> 1013.06
fight to Flat Earth really believes that

1010.48 --> 1016.36
we are making our own making up our own

1013.06 --> 1019.029
reality around science sorry Freudian

1016.36 --> 1023.25
slip and he made some really bad

1019.029 --> 1023.25
examples to prove his point yep

1041.8 --> 1047.1699999999998
all right well dank look the video you

1044.74 --> 1050.86
are you talking about the video from

1047.17 --> 1053.89
sleeping warrior yesterday because that

1050.86 --> 1058.7199999999998
one wasn't that bad like Tony talks a

1053.89 --> 1063.67
lot oh maybe it was kind of bad I don't

1058.72 --> 1065.38
know it certainly didn't get any better

1063.67 --> 1072.18
at the end he just started to blabber on

1065.38 --> 1072.18
with more crazy nonsense and denial

1089.76 --> 1101.67
okie-dokie what the [ __ ] is that the

1092.35 --> 1109.57
second time I saw that nonsense mmm

1101.67 --> 1111.88
alright let's say pretend scan bought

1109.57 --> 1118.35
probably trying to create some hype

1111.88 --> 1118.3500000000001
about that yeah

1125.44 --> 1135.19
Spurs was on with rumpus afterward and

1128.91 --> 1137.46
oh what's that I think I missed that

1135.19 --> 1137.46
part

1160.76 --> 1165.58
why do you think Spurs is a PO

1200.49 --> 1210.06
I froze no I'm not freezing I'm just

1203.13 --> 1210.6000000000001
standing really really still yeah I can

1210.06 --> 1215.7
do that

1210.6 --> 1218.6699999999998
it's freeze yeah if you do that in the

1215.7 --> 1222.42
shadows you become really really hard to

1218.67 --> 1224.66
see especially when I'm all wearing

1222.42 --> 1224.66
black

1245.04 --> 1253.1399999999999
Oh a pretender so an actor did that's

1251.34 --> 1254.9399999999998
basically what you mean that he's an

1253.14 --> 1258.75
actor he's putting up an act

1254.94 --> 1261.77
who ever considered that acting may be

1258.75 --> 1265.44
the only form he even knows how to

1261.77 --> 1267.51
interact with other people because I'm

1265.44 --> 1275.1200000000001
pretty sure the guy has like in an

1267.51 --> 1275.12
autistic streak to him so yeah that

1275.69 --> 1286.1100000000001
would spread but I don't think he it's

1280.16 --> 1290.5800000000002
he is like a person but he does have a

1286.11 --> 1293.1599999999999
certain posture that he always maneuvers

1290.58 --> 1296.1599999999999
within that posture that is typically

1293.16 --> 1299.0700000000002
sports chemo he doesn't break that axe

1296.16 --> 1302.6100000000001
which in a technical sense it kind of is

1299.07 --> 1305.97
it's the attitude you uphold that how

1302.61 --> 1309.1499999999999
you present yourself but I wouldn't say

1305.97 --> 1311.16
that he's like in reality a completely

1309.15 --> 1315.8000000000002
different person and all that no not at

1311.16 --> 1323.7
all I think he just is like that

1315.8 --> 1325.95
so Brenda must be PO right right like a

1323.7 --> 1332.18
poser that's where that comes from isn't

1325.95 --> 1332.18
it well I think well I think Brenda look

1334.7 --> 1342.45
yeah that's I don't know who Brenda

1339.63 --> 1344.5500000000002
thinks she is I think she probably up to

1342.45 --> 1345.96
holds a whole different act two

1344.55 --> 1348.6599999999999
different types of people in her

1345.96 --> 1351.96
personal life so I think that that that

1348.66 --> 1355.02
she may actually be technically more of

1351.96 --> 1358.05
a PO than Swersky mo but this is all

1355.02 --> 1367.01
just a rumor blabbering this is not what

1358.05 --> 1367.01
I'm for hey guns have never an RV

1370.88 --> 1374.239
[Music]

1375.58 --> 1382.33
Brenda is just a mimicker Jesus

1391.02 --> 1396.09
now what I think that's per schema is

1393.059 --> 1399.559
pretty cool these days or at least he's

1396.09 --> 1403.11
gone better because well from his

1399.559 --> 1405.3899999999999
posture from his position he's kind of

1403.11 --> 1407.7299999999998
always like forced to test people

1405.39 --> 1409.679
psychologically that's like the project

1407.73 --> 1411.57
and that he's non-stop working that's

1409.679 --> 1414.5400000000002
what he's doing he that's like how he

1411.57 --> 1417.059
works I can see that because he does it

1414.54 --> 1422.1
every time and he can't help but try to

1417.059 --> 1425.85
pry everywhere including places that you

1422.1 --> 1431.25
kind of shouldn't like that's what he

1425.85 --> 1434.1299999999999
did with the whole like what is it the

1431.25 --> 1436.23
gradient situation the weird gas

1434.13 --> 1438.8400000000001
pressure no pressure situation and all

1436.23 --> 1442.38
that like he that was a test

1438.84 --> 1445.1599999999999
I think he's kind of dropped it too I

1442.38 --> 1447.42
don't hear him about it anymore

1445.16 --> 1449.429
so I think that was a little mecha

1447.42 --> 1453.1200000000001
nation that he probably figured out

1449.429 --> 1456.23
picked up on or or made himself in his

1453.12 --> 1459.54
mind spontaneous to kind of test the

1456.23 --> 1462.679
flat earthers resolve concerning the gas

1459.54 --> 1462.6789999999999
pressure situation

1466.64 --> 1481.71
but he's yeah he's in like he seems to

1473.85 --> 1484.77
be more careful now more aware also on a

1481.71 --> 1487.19
on a conscious level of like what you

1484.77 --> 1489.87
can do what you shouldn't do he's just

1487.19 --> 1492.5700000000002
effectively being more diplomatic at

1489.87 --> 1495.3
what he's doing and at that I think he's

1492.57 --> 1496.8899999999999
grown a lot and he doesn't agitate me as

1495.3 --> 1500.37
much as he used to because he used to

1496.89 --> 1503.3600000000001
piss me off a time he pretty good still

1500.37 --> 1508.62
could but he just doesn't do it

1503.36 --> 1512.1
constantly as much I don't experience it

1508.62 --> 1515.4199999999998
like that anymore so yeah this process

1512.1 --> 1515.4199999999998
is kind of growing too

1518.43 --> 1528.049
[Music]

1521.22 --> 1528.049
Oh God and he'll really

1532.44 --> 1536.8600000000001
I didn't

1534.16 --> 1538.77
and then I get you know in a way I can't

1536.86 --> 1541.6
believe that you could still watch

1538.77 --> 1545.11
grantees not because of Randy but just

1541.6 --> 1547.3
because well Brenda they're blabbering

1545.11 --> 1549.1599999999999
and ranty letting that all happen as he

1547.3 --> 1552.25
always I can't believe you prefer

1549.16 --> 1560.23
watching that over the flat earth the

1552.25 --> 1562.8
basses but maybe that's just me yeah

1560.23 --> 1569.55
they do find it a bit weird sometimes

1562.8 --> 1569.55
but yeah you do what you like of course

1574.38 --> 1577.459
[Music]

1586.56 --> 1592.6399999999999
too much cussing but it's not always

1591.27 --> 1598.1
like that

1592.64 --> 1598.1000000000001
just periods things got a rowdy

1603.86 --> 1608.4799999999998
[Music]

1606.17 --> 1612.8300000000002
but I think I get it you don't like the

1608.48 --> 1618.1100000000001
the full outloud type of because it's

1612.83 --> 1622.82
probably like yeah it's pretty intense

1618.11 --> 1625.49
and the way it works basically it's

1622.82 --> 1627.8899999999999
almost like a couples fighting like

1625.49 --> 1629.84
they're not really able to do anything

1627.89 --> 1631.91
about each other but they're just

1629.84 --> 1634.82
constantly trying to psychologically

1631.91 --> 1637.19
dominate one another's [ __ ] so I guess

1634.82 --> 1640.01
you don't like that I yeah maybe you've

1637.19 --> 1644.51
had some bad experiences that then I

1640.01 --> 1646.61
would understand because it is a

1644.51 --> 1648.83
psychological struggle for dominance in

1646.61 --> 1651.83
a way you know what's going on there at

1648.83 --> 1657.02
the Flat Earth debate that is part of

1651.83 --> 1661.9399999999998
the show if a name-calling is childish I

1657.02 --> 1662.75
agree but sometimes after certain things

1661.94 --> 1665.9
have happened

1662.75 --> 1670.43
it can be very fitting it's it's like

1665.9 --> 1672.6200000000001
comedy and it is comedic to me in many

1670.43 --> 1674.3600000000001
ways even though sometimes it's maybe a

1672.62 --> 1675.8899999999999
little bit too harsh or kind of out of

1674.36 --> 1677.8999999999999
the tone you know it's not always

1675.89 --> 1681.5300000000002
perfect when he does it but a lot of

1677.9 --> 1686.5300000000002
times I think he's like really even

1681.53 --> 1692.06
using just his wrath in a creative way

1686.53 --> 1695.24
not always and I don't know did the

1692.06 --> 1697.4199999999998
powers they do really deserve it most of

1695.24 --> 1697.42
them

1702.7 --> 1707.0800000000002
it's my long-term goal ah

1708.49 --> 1716.1200000000001
well getting a better life like growing

1713.66 --> 1719.48
and being better at what I'm doing right

1716.12 --> 1722.54
here on my show hopefully expanding my

1719.48 --> 1725.03
skill range and tapping into some new

1722.54 --> 1726.58
sources to actually fuel doing all of

1725.03 --> 1730.58
that

1726.58 --> 1734.8999999999999
now also yeah maybe writing a book I got

1730.58 --> 1738.53
notes these days talked about it

1734.9 --> 1742.3400000000001
yesterday so yeah many goals also hope

1738.53 --> 1746.42
to find a maybe a cute girlfriend what's

1742.34 --> 1748.6399999999999
funny today there was this there's a

1746.42 --> 1752.29
neighbor girl a woman that I haven't

1748.64 --> 1754.8500000000001
seen before and she was kind of cute

1752.29 --> 1757.43
it was weird she opened the door for me

1754.85 --> 1760.4599999999998
but she was like smiling in a way that

1757.43 --> 1763.27
that I recognized the signal and yeah

1760.46 --> 1763.27
who knows

1769.82 --> 1774.52
there might be a slight issue though

1777.61 --> 1786.1699999999998
because she had like a remnants of pink

1782.09 --> 1788.8999999999999
dye in her hair I don't know maybe

1786.17 --> 1792.71
there's types really dig me you know

1788.9 --> 1795.92
being all black Sultan I know what it is

1792.71 --> 1800.8400000000001
you know at some point I'm just I'm

1795.92 --> 1805.01
gonna just do stuff you know I've also

1800.84 --> 1807.6699999999998
already reconciled like yeah if I really

1805.01 --> 1811.76
want to build a life with a woman then

1807.67 --> 1817.67
you can't just meet your wife just like

1811.76 --> 1823.49
that and then you get me that's yeah so

1817.67 --> 1826.43
I'm gonna basically just have to just

1823.49 --> 1829.19
engage and just try stuff and see what

1826.43 --> 1831.4
life is like outside of my personal

1829.19 --> 1831.4
bubble

1840.12 --> 1848.1299999999999
yes dank of course no but for me it's

1843.36 --> 1851.4289999999999
just a sign you know some point in my

1848.13 --> 1853.7990000000002
life was it I was 16 or something I dyed

1851.429 --> 1858.179
my hair too but yeah it was wearing a

1853.799 --> 1861.27
weird color a hippie clothes anyway like

1858.179 --> 1866.429
neo hippy or whatever but yeah I

1861.27 --> 1870.98
wouldn't do that right now and I don't

1866.429 --> 1870.98
know figure

1877.18 --> 1885.7
people only want to open up after you

1879.73 --> 1888.76
insult them well that's gonna be tough

1885.7 --> 1892.0900000000001
with me because I'm like this stoic guy

1888.76 --> 1894.69
that just refuses to be insulted unless

1892.09 --> 1896.8899999999999
it's like meant as some kind of

1894.69 --> 1900.6100000000001
domination thing like somebody's trying

1896.89 --> 1903.22
to take my spiritual territory in the

1900.61 --> 1907.02
location or something you know that's

1903.22 --> 1907.02
their friend oh yeah I'll respond then

1909.63 --> 1916.0900000000001
but I'm not very easily a grout to do

1913.84 --> 1922.33
something to respond to somebody's

1916.09 --> 1924.31
behavior unless I'm like in the moment

1922.33 --> 1927.34
just happened to be kind of agitated

1924.31 --> 1929.32
anyway oh yeah then uh then I will

1927.34 --> 1932.76
definitely respond then even hold back

1929.32 --> 1939.04
does it still be polite enough you know

1932.76 --> 1946.96
anyway do I practice stoicism what they

1939.04 --> 1950.98
were pret no well I used to when I was

1946.96 --> 1952.81
young you know when you got crazy

1950.98 --> 1955.96
feelings that are physically like

1952.81 --> 1960.28
palpably or spiritually tearing you

1955.96 --> 1962.82
apart yeah you put you just freeze you

1960.28 --> 1965.91
just keep it like that or yeah

1962.82 --> 1965.9099999999999
[Music]

1971.47 --> 1979.4
so yeah I used to do that a lot that's

1976.22 --> 1982.3
kind of a a trademark of my introvert

1979.4 --> 1982.3000000000002
nature in a way

1987.73 --> 1990.839
[Music]

1993.42 --> 1998.52
does that answer your question Chanukah

1995.49 --> 2000.64
whatta I maybe I misunderstood the

1998.52 --> 2000.6399999999999
question

2014.1 --> 2017.03
I don't know

2020.2 --> 2026.78
when it happens it happens yeah I said

2023.33 --> 2031.37
now it's fine I'm okay I'm not I'm not

2026.78 --> 2033.47
like punishing myself for my actions

2031.37 --> 2036.77
socially or lack thereof

2033.47 --> 2041.18
I just tried to realize like how does it

2036.77 --> 2043.49
work what could I have done because some

2041.18 --> 2046.13
of these moments where I could

2043.49 --> 2048.62
potentially like contact somebody just

2046.13 --> 2052.429
in the moment that's like real magical

2048.62 --> 2055.7599999999998
to me and I don't remember a lot of it

2052.429 --> 2058.61
it's like been such a long time I've

2055.76 --> 2061.94
never been an easy social engagement

2058.61 --> 2066.9190000000003
like never always been the shy kid like

2061.94 --> 2071.96
when I do it I that happens every

2066.919 --> 2074.929
freaking time like unless I'm literally

2071.96 --> 2077.7200000000003
everyday just doing but I would just my

2074.929 --> 2080.78
head would break I would be able to

2077.72 --> 2087.1099999999997
handle my memory wouldn't be able to to

2080.78 --> 2089.4500000000003
handle all that so yeah I need to

2087.11 --> 2090.6400000000003
prepare in a lot of ways just how it

2089.45 --> 2093.29
works

2090.64 --> 2096.2599999999998
interacting with people I need to get a

2093.29 --> 2099.74
sniff of it first just to remember what

2096.26 --> 2102.4100000000003
that is and then how like where am I

2099.74 --> 2104.9599999999996
gonna go with that energy like like if I

2102.41 --> 2107.72
would do something what would it be like

2104.96 --> 2110.87
how would my expectations be too high

2107.72 --> 2112.97
what is the most likely reality response

2110.87 --> 2116.9
that I would get how she would she

2112.97 --> 2120.1
respond if she like this like that what

2116.9 --> 2123.11
would it all mean it presuppositional

2120.1 --> 2125.42
chaos and if I think too much about it

2123.11 --> 2126.98
it actually this is a problem with that

2125.42 --> 2128.96
because I'd know how to do it so

2126.98 --> 2131.21
elaborately and and more effectively

2128.96 --> 2133.67
with more effective inside these days

2131.21 --> 2136.07
then say 20 or 30 years ago March more

2133.67 --> 2140.51
effectively much more effectively my

2136.07 --> 2143.09
modeling of prediction of situations

2140.51 --> 2148.19
because I just seemed so much more but

2143.09 --> 2150.9100000000003
it's still not like really elaborate

2148.19 --> 2153.77
enough for me

2150.91 --> 2156.2
that then I'm just gonna step up to

2153.77 --> 2159.44
people because it's also an identity

2156.2 --> 2166.1
question I guess like I don't feel like

2159.44 --> 2168.26
I'm the person to do that it I got weird

2166.1 --> 2171.83
sensations sometimes too like I

2168.26 --> 2173.5400000000004
shouldn't do that because they wouldn't

2171.83 --> 2176.86
be able to handle me even though at

2173.54 --> 2176.86
first they might think they would

2192.98 --> 2199.43
ten more minutes no no no sorry Amanda
