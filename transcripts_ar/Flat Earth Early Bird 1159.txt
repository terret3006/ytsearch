there's just this

121.84 --> 128.6
enormous wind going on like really

125.04 --> 128.6
serious wind

128.959 --> 134.72
like yeah this kind of gusts of wind can

131.12 --> 136.31900000000002
like blow you off the road

134.72 --> 138.319
if you're on a bicycle if you i'm not

136.319 --> 141.879
careful because sometimes it just really

138.319 --> 141.879
rips in there

142.879 --> 147.599
so yeah it was out for groceries earlier

149.04 --> 151.51999999999998
and like

152.16 --> 155.76
like bicycles are like fallen over

154.4 --> 157.68
everywhere because they're just being

155.76 --> 160.39999999999998
blown over

157.68 --> 162.4
that kind of wind

160.4 --> 164.56
but yeah the sun is really nice and

162.4 --> 166.959
bright in between all that

164.56 --> 169.76
like a really bright and

166.959 --> 172.08
that sky how incredibly clear blue that

169.76 --> 172.07999999999998

209.28 --> 214.08
right yeah the temperature i almost

211.2 --> 216.23899999999998

214.08 --> 218.959

216.239 --> 220.56
just went for groceries without gloves

218.959 --> 223.12

223.12 --> 227.59900000000002

235.28 --> 238.72
hello slow mo moon buggy

238.959 --> 245.2
yo university campus what

242.959 --> 245.20000000000002
oh

248.799 --> 252.84
right so yeah it's this weird kind of

251.12 --> 255.519
feeling that spring is

252.84 --> 257.44
coming right unfortunately though i'm

255.519 --> 259.28000000000003
not enjoying it

257.44 --> 261.28
too much

259.28 --> 263.28
because i stayed up way

261.28 --> 265.35999999999996
way too late last night

263.28 --> 268.35999999999996
i'm really feeling sorry for that right

265.36 --> 268.36
now

268.56 --> 274.0
because i feel a bit wonky

271.199 --> 275.04
just stayed up until like

274.0 --> 277.28
five

275.04 --> 280.40000000000003
it's just a terrible idea but it was

277.28 --> 283.75899999999996
this freaking wind even worse all night

280.4 --> 286.08
long and it just

283.759 --> 289.28000000000003
i was almost like waiting for it to stop

286.08 --> 289.28
which is kind of crazy

289.919 --> 295.19899999999996
and watching movies on netflix

294.32 --> 297.04
and

295.199 --> 298.639
yeah i just should feel like i shouldn't

297.04 --> 300.08000000000004
have done that i should have just gone

298.639 --> 302.16
to bed but i didn't

300.08 --> 303.84
so now i feel a bit wonky and yeah

302.16 --> 305.68
there's nothing i can really do about it

303.84 --> 307.59999999999997
except

305.68 --> 310.0
go to bed in time

307.6 --> 311.52000000000004
today and make sure that doesn't happen

310.0 --> 314.639
again

311.52 --> 314.639
hello stone monkey

321.759 --> 324.84000000000003
all right

326.56 --> 333.28000000000003
so yeah yesterday's flat earth debate

330.08 --> 336.0
was pretty interesting

333.28 --> 336.0
and intense

336.24 --> 343.039
i've i barely got a word in there

340.32 --> 345.84
and everybody was very excited but i

343.039 --> 347.84
think i was yeah

345.84 --> 351.08
it was my turn again to take the blame

347.84 --> 351.08
for everything

352.08 --> 354.8
nathan was constantly

353.84 --> 356.96
yeah

354.8 --> 361.08
telling me to shut up even though like

356.96 --> 365.039
kiwi was literally constantly rumpusing

361.08 --> 368.15999999999997
constantly constantly rumpusing

365.039 --> 372.24
constantly rumpusing kewee

368.16 --> 372.24
nathan didn't say a word to him

376.16 --> 379.88000000000005
hey julie of heaven

380.88 --> 387.84
i mean kiwi was effectively destroying

384.16 --> 389.52000000000004
nathan's show by literally just

387.84 --> 391.919
denying

389.52 --> 394.08
communication access to people in

391.919 --> 397.12
discord even though nathan obviously

394.08 --> 400.24
wanted to communicate so yeah qe is like

397.12 --> 403.52
almost sabotaging the show at this point

400.24 --> 406.40000000000003
and nathan did not say a single word but

403.52 --> 408.96
i speak of oh shut the hell up irwin

406.4 --> 410.63899999999995
shut the hell up are we like yeah thanks

408.96 --> 413.35999999999996
for that

410.639 --> 413.36
thanks a lot

423.12 --> 426.88
i mean i'm actually inserting very quick

425.919 --> 429.12
points

426.88 --> 431.84
sometimes in inconvenient moments but i

429.12 --> 434.8
don't literally sabotage the show by

431.84 --> 437.19899999999996
telling nathan no this guy is not going

434.8 --> 439.919
to talk yeah

437.199 --> 443.68
which somebody else does and nathan

439.919 --> 443.68
never says anything about it

447.039 --> 451.24
ever

448.24 --> 451.24
ever

451.759 --> 456.16
you're cocking to him nathan you're

453.52 --> 457.28
cocking to john you are you're cocking

456.16 --> 459.52000000000004
to him

457.28 --> 459.52
and

459.759 --> 464.0
that was all fine and dandy but if you

461.759 --> 466.879
then use me as some kind of a lightning

464.0 --> 468.16
rod for that that pisses me off

466.879 --> 470.639
yeah

468.16 --> 474.319
don't freaking [ __ ] to one person and

470.639 --> 476.96000000000004
then use me as a freaking likening rod

474.319 --> 478.56
yeah i am not part of your pecking order

476.96 --> 481.44
okay nathan

478.56 --> 481.44
not part of that

483.28 --> 488.15999999999997
when you deal

485.12 --> 491.96
with the person causing the problems

488.16 --> 491.96000000000004
which is not me

497.759 --> 501.599
hey flair sage

500.0 --> 504.16
yeah thank you for the paypal donation

501.599 --> 505.52
by the way flatter sage

504.16 --> 506.47900000000004
i got it

505.52 --> 507.599
like

506.479 --> 510.4
this night

507.599 --> 510.4
thank you very much

518.719 --> 522.0
all right so yeah i needed to get that

520.64 --> 523.919
off my chest i didn't really say

522.0 --> 527.839
anything about it yesterday because so

523.919 --> 527.8389999999999
blatantly obvious what was going on

528.8 --> 535.8389999999999
i'm just kind of annoyed

530.959 --> 535.8389999999999
by the straight out hypocrisy of it

548.72 --> 552.64
hey adam price good to see you

556.56 --> 558.88
right

559.839 --> 564.5600000000001
and anyway despite all that yes this

562.48 --> 565.9200000000001
flare of debate was pretty good

564.56 --> 567.279
it did last

565.92 --> 568.0799999999999
decently

567.279 --> 569.68
long

568.08 --> 574.2
yeah after show

569.68 --> 574.1999999999999
and had great conversations afterwards

582.399 --> 584.8
all right

586.0 --> 589.72
other than that

596.88 --> 600.32
let's see

597.44 --> 602.48
[Music]

600.32 --> 604.48
yeah watch the picture a bit of owen

602.48 --> 609.24
benjamin

604.48 --> 609.24
and then started to go watch netflix

622.8 --> 627.68
right also yeah it's troll time so this

625.6 --> 630.399
means i need to

627.68 --> 630.399
i need to

631.04 --> 634.8
basically

632.399 --> 638.16
harden up a little i need to armor up

634.8 --> 638.16
because the trolls are back

638.56 --> 642.3199999999999
i'm very curious as to why

643.04 --> 646.279
it's like

646.72 --> 652.0790000000001
not a coincidence because it was

650.44 --> 654.8000000000001
worldwide

652.079 --> 656.959
worldwide

654.8 --> 658.079
not just here

656.959 --> 660.8
everywhere

658.079 --> 663.3599999999999
everywhere on the internet suddenly

660.8 --> 665.4399999999999
trolls broke out

663.36 --> 668.16
the same ones

665.44 --> 671.44
like they were all given a green light

668.16 --> 671.4399999999999
it's really bizarre

672.24 --> 675.92
so however that's driven whether it's

674.16 --> 679.76
some kind of a

675.92 --> 679.76
misinformation program

682.72 --> 690.64
or the devil literally seeping into his

686.64 --> 690.64
most pathetic servants

691.04 --> 695.279
and just

692.079 --> 698.4799999999999
animating them to do what they do again

695.279 --> 701.6
i do not know for certain i just know

698.48 --> 703.6
worldwide trolls have broken out

701.6 --> 705.519
and start nagging people and they're

703.6 --> 707.12
worse than they used to be before

705.519 --> 710.079
they're worse now

707.12 --> 710.079
and it's everywhere

710.48 --> 716.0
has anybody else noticed that suddenly

713.12 --> 719.12
the trolls are breaking out everywhere

716.0 --> 720.88
and they're worse than they were before

719.12 --> 722.48
anybody noticing that

720.88 --> 724.959
in chat

722.48 --> 728.0
not just talking about my show and my

724.959 --> 731.4399999999999
chat talking about everywhere else have

728.0 --> 733.36
you noticed that

731.44 --> 736.399
there was a silent

733.36 --> 739.04
time where where like somebody might be

736.399 --> 739.92
trolling here and there

739.04 --> 742.56
but

739.92 --> 745.8389999999999
not the break out kind of like where i'm

742.56 --> 748.16
gonna destroy your shows troll

745.839 --> 749.2790000000001
they haven't been there for a while and

748.16 --> 752.399
suddenly

749.279 --> 754.48
everywhere everywhere everywhere

752.399 --> 756.6
everything i watch everything i watch

754.48 --> 759.76
even freaking infowars

756.6 --> 761.519
everything i watch everything

759.76 --> 763.4399999999999
in chat rooms

761.519 --> 766.24
in comment sections

763.44 --> 768.8800000000001
they've all suddenly started to explode

766.24 --> 772.6800000000001
forward again

768.88 --> 772.68
on that nasty level

773.279 --> 776.959
it happened since last weekend

777.44 --> 781.839
no it's not due to the sexton challenge

779.36 --> 785.2
i think it has something to do with

781.839 --> 787.839
with like the the trucker [ __ ]

785.2 --> 787.839
and trudeau

792.399 --> 798.16
it seemed to correlate directly with

794.639 --> 800.639
what happened there and maybe even like

798.16 --> 803.12
russia and ukraine or something it's

800.639 --> 805.6800000000001
bigger it's there but

803.12 --> 809.9590000000001
yeah i just noticed like suddenly

805.68 --> 809.959
it's like they all got a green light

829.68 --> 836.519
what tara 306 what are you talking about

832.959 --> 836.5189999999999
spring sale

845.12 --> 850.0
right

846.48 --> 852.16
but also notice that these bots

850.0 --> 854.639
because i think that i whether they're

852.16 --> 857.6
people and they have they have turned

854.639 --> 859.6
themselves into bots

857.6 --> 860.8000000000001
or whether they're literally bots i kind

859.6 --> 864.16
of doubt it

860.8 --> 866.4799999999999
maybe partially their bots

864.16 --> 868.8389999999999
but i just noticed that

866.48 --> 871.9200000000001
they are literally of the devil

868.839 --> 873.36
literally they are in the reversed world

871.92 --> 876.3199999999999
and they will take

873.36 --> 879.36
anything any subject

876.32 --> 882.48
doesn't matter where it goes

879.36 --> 886.9590000000001
any subject in any field and they will

882.48 --> 886.9590000000001
[ __ ] it up on purpose

888.32 --> 892.1600000000001
they they know no bounce they go

890.399 --> 895.12
everywhere

892.16 --> 897.519
they go into religion

895.12 --> 898.48
they go into flat earth they go into

897.519 --> 901.12
politic

898.48 --> 904.0790000000001
go anywhere and they'll do everything

901.12 --> 907.44
that is the worst imaginable

904.079 --> 908.88
they always do the wrong thing always

907.44 --> 910.0790000000001
and that's what i'm starting to notice

908.88 --> 913.279
is that these

910.079 --> 914.88
are not just people trolling something

913.279 --> 916.24
they cannot handle

914.88 --> 918.88
right

916.24 --> 921.519
no these are people that are [ __ ]

918.88 --> 924.079
monsters they're psychotic devil

921.519 --> 926.88
possessed demon [ __ ]

924.079 --> 929.3599999999999
and they'll destroy anything anything

926.88 --> 930.8
any subject they just want to [ __ ]

929.36 --> 932.32
everything up

930.8 --> 935.519
they're nasty

932.32 --> 935.519
disgusting people

939.759 --> 946.6800000000001
and i hope they choke

943.12 --> 946.68
i hope they choke

955.279 --> 962.399
a massive conspiracy

957.68 --> 964.16
no a conspiracy would require conscious

962.399 --> 966.32
conspiracy

964.16 --> 968.56
rocket man you don't seem to realize the

966.32 --> 971.12
word conspiracy requires conscious

968.56 --> 973.5999999999999
attention i'm saying there is an event

971.12 --> 976.8
there is something

973.6 --> 980.8000000000001
that made it come forth all at once

976.8 --> 985.12
that's not a conspiracy that's an effect

980.8 --> 987.68
a conspiracy require knowing parties

985.12 --> 991.279
to make decisions on doing things in

987.68 --> 995.8
secret that's not what this is about

991.279 --> 995.8
that can't be what it is about

996.639 --> 1000.92
now they're not just spam bots

1016.16 --> 1021.36
oh maybe partially they are

1019.759 --> 1025.1200000000001
i don't know for sure

1021.36 --> 1029.28
but they're based on real people though

1025.12 --> 1031.6789999999999
and just take whatever is nasty enough

1029.28 --> 1033.439
but for example the truth this troll

1031.679 --> 1035.3600000000001
person that's been

1033.439 --> 1038.799
yeah getting in my way again and even

1035.36 --> 1040.9589999999998
like calls me on my phone

1038.799 --> 1043.199
that guy's a shape-shifter

1040.959 --> 1045.76
that might actually be a bug i've never

1043.199 --> 1049.8390000000002
heard an actual voice

1045.76 --> 1049.839
never actually spoke anything into

1049.84 --> 1056.6399999999999
into my phone doesn't have a real voice

1053.919 --> 1059.3600000000001
now sometimes he i think he

1056.64 --> 1060.96
records [ __ ] sometime but

1059.36 --> 1064.32
he was literally

1060.96 --> 1066.88
acting like he was a christian

1064.32 --> 1067.6789999999999
like that guy that's now all pissy about

1066.88 --> 1071.7600000000002
me

1067.679 --> 1075.8400000000001
that's the troll that's the troll the

1071.76 --> 1078.32
troll one guy one troll guy

1075.84 --> 1081.28
that's been like doing shitty things and

1078.32 --> 1084.0
being like a really satanic

1081.28 --> 1086.6399999999999
even up to two years ago

1084.0 --> 1088.88
and he's now acting like a christian and

1086.64 --> 1089.679
like he's outraged about something about

1088.88 --> 1092.64
that

1089.679 --> 1095.039
and he's been trolling other chats about

1092.64 --> 1097.1200000000001
it too has been commenting he's still

1095.039 --> 1101.039
doing it

1097.12 --> 1101.039
guy is a [ __ ] monster

1101.36 --> 1107.3999999999999
that's exactly what i told him he was

1103.2 --> 1107.4
yesterday he is a monster

1114.48 --> 1118.48
just realize there's people literally

1117.12 --> 1120.559
acting

1118.48 --> 1123.44
like they are part of a group

1120.559 --> 1126.799
just to destroy it

1123.44 --> 1128.0
to seed hypocrisy and confusion and

1126.799 --> 1131.12
hatred

1128.0 --> 1134.76
within the group to destroy it

1131.12 --> 1134.76
is what he's doing

1136.32 --> 1141.52
right so be very careful

1138.64 --> 1143.44
as to unidentified people

1141.52 --> 1147.6
suddenly getting in the chat and

1143.44 --> 1147.6000000000001
claiming to be in a certain way

1148.08 --> 1154.1999999999998
be very careful

1149.679 --> 1154.2
they are there to destroy it

1171.919 --> 1174.5590000000002
hey glitch

1176.88 --> 1180.72
right yeah yeah owen benjamin is having

1179.12 --> 1182.08
a whole item

1180.72 --> 1184.64
about a.i

1182.08 --> 1187.52
in last few days

1184.64 --> 1189.2
so maybe he thinks

1187.52 --> 1192.559
that it is

1189.2 --> 1194.559
really all bots it could be i

1192.559 --> 1196.08
it's just that these are not like the

1194.559 --> 1199.2
typical

1196.08 --> 1202.0
weirdo random generator bots

1199.2 --> 1204.48
right these are very sophisticated

1202.0 --> 1207.12
pre-programmed

1204.48 --> 1210.08
responses

1207.12 --> 1211.6
that are meant to fool you into thinking

1210.08 --> 1214.1589999999999
it's a real person

1211.6 --> 1217.8799999999999
so it's not just like a random story

1214.159 --> 1217.88
generator or anything

1220.32 --> 1223.6
306 and

1224.799 --> 1230.4
oh playing well yeah clutch i'm okay i'm

1227.52 --> 1232.08
a bit woozy because i didn't really have

1230.4 --> 1234.72
enough sleep this night

1232.08 --> 1236.799
and it's like constant wind

1234.72 --> 1240.32
driving me nuts

1236.799 --> 1240.32
but i'm already doing a little better

1240.72 --> 1244.0
last 20 minutes so

1244.799 --> 1249.84
oh and i got half a cup song so that's

1247.28 --> 1249.84
always nice

1253.28 --> 1261.48
i originally had two halves of a crown

1256.159 --> 1261.48
zone but i already hate ate one half

1282.0 --> 1285.0
uh

1292.48 --> 1295.039
that's right

1295.76 --> 1301.12
anyway but eventually

1298.96 --> 1303.039
like if the trolling like gets even

1301.12 --> 1306.6399999999999
worse although it's not even that bad

1303.039 --> 1309.28
today so who knows it's up and down

1306.64 --> 1312.159
but when it gets really bad like i will

1309.28 --> 1313.2
probably just then use temporary members

1312.159 --> 1315.1200000000001
only

1313.2 --> 1316.24
because that's the thing that really

1315.12 --> 1318.2399999999998
stops him

1316.24 --> 1320.0
right but it does mean that people that

1318.24 --> 1320.96
don't have a wrench they can't then

1320.0 --> 1323.76
comment

1320.96 --> 1325.44
well that's the case so

1323.76 --> 1327.28
i can

1325.44 --> 1329.3600000000001
still do that

1327.28 --> 1331.6
as like a

1329.36 --> 1333.84
security measure

1331.6 --> 1333.84
right

1340.01 --> 1343.14
[Music]

1364.799 --> 1369.679
yeah rocketman i know ai is highly

1367.28 --> 1372.6789999999999
overblown

1369.679 --> 1372.679
but

1374.559 --> 1377.76
i think that some people might literally

1377.039 --> 1382.0
be

1377.76 --> 1382.0
programming themselves as robots

1384.4 --> 1390.96
because they're just that

1387.28 --> 1393.52
dislocated from normal human conscious

1390.96 --> 1393.52
and behavior

1393.919 --> 1398.72
so sometimes i think that some people

1396.48 --> 1400.88
especially trollish types when they get

1398.72 --> 1404.159
really triggered it's almost like they

1400.88 --> 1404.159
turn into robots

1411.84 --> 1417.76
but that's not ai that's just

1415.039 --> 1420.32
yeah psychologically degenerated

1417.76 --> 1420.32
behavior

1424.559 --> 1428.96
right you could explain it as it's

1426.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
somebody's

1428.96 --> 1435.159
obsession that just makes them abandon

1431.84 --> 1435.1589999999999
all subtlety

1449.279 --> 1452.36
all right

1479.44 --> 1482.72
all right no

1481.36 --> 1487.1999999999998
that's correct

1482.72 --> 1489.039
ai is not magic what it is however is

1487.2 --> 1491.8400000000001
social engineering

1489.039 --> 1494.48
extracted data templates of human

1491.84 --> 1494.48
behavior

1494.799 --> 1498.84
basically sized up from

1497.039 --> 1501.76
a non-human

1498.84 --> 1505.6789999999999
perspective and then just

1501.76 --> 1508.4
yeah patterns patterns with results

1505.679 --> 1512.64
that's what it really is

1508.4 --> 1514.4
so it's just giant databases of things

1512.64 --> 1517.6000000000001
and ways

1514.4 --> 1520.3200000000002
yeah just subjects and ways people say

1517.6 --> 1522.3999999999999
things and how other people respond to

1520.32 --> 1526.1589999999999
that psychologically

1522.4 --> 1529.279
and just a massive database of that with

1526.159 --> 1532.0
with certain systems

1529.279 --> 1535.679
so it's just a giant social engineering

1532.0 --> 1535.679
data project every time

1535.919 --> 1538.48
right but

1540.32 --> 1546.0
humans know how to say things

1542.88 --> 1547.7600000000002
in a logically consistent way

1546.0 --> 1551.039
ai does not

1547.76 --> 1552.96
all it can effectively do so far is

1551.039 --> 1556.279
write things down

1552.96 --> 1556.279
in a

1556.32 --> 1561.279
like an emotionally

1558.72 --> 1565.279
expectable pattern

1561.279 --> 1569.279
like it can fulfill standard needs

1565.279 --> 1571.279
but it cannot really achieve cohesion to

1569.279 --> 1572.24
the human level

1571.279 --> 1574.159
simple

1572.24 --> 1576.0
it's not able to do that i've nev it's

1574.159 --> 1579.2
like that's the one

1576.0 --> 1582.48
trait the one trait you can always tell

1579.2 --> 1585.679
them apart from a real human

1582.48 --> 1587.679
they can't get that human level cohesion

1585.679 --> 1589.3600000000001
in their communication

1587.679 --> 1591.76
there's always like

1589.36 --> 1594.76
rough edges

1591.76 --> 1594.76
always

1610.4 --> 1614.88
this week maybe your week for targeting

1613.2 --> 1617.2
well not just me

1614.88 --> 1622.279
but yeah i've been targeted by trolls

1617.2 --> 1622.279
plenty because yeah i respond right

1628.64 --> 1631.3600000000001
hello wrath

1636.64 --> 1640.7990000000002
yeah but i think it's just this one guy

1639.2 --> 1643.679
there's one guy i think he's from

1640.799 --> 1646.1589999999999
england and he just really

1643.679 --> 1648.5590000000002
really hates me everything about me he

1646.159 --> 1648.5590000000002
hates

1649.679 --> 1653.6000000000001
i don't know he might be just in love

1651.679 --> 1657.0
with me or something

1653.6 --> 1657.0
just gross

1690.48 --> 1693.679
all right

1691.919 --> 1697.8400000000001
narrative generator if you're going to

1693.679 --> 1701.1200000000001
talk about what's actually driving forth

1697.84 --> 1703.279
like the world media system

1701.12 --> 1706.399
that's different

1703.279 --> 1710.399
because that doesn't really use just

1706.399 --> 1714.559
random constructed things right what it

1710.399 --> 1717.84
does do is constantly analyze

1714.559 --> 1719.2
past situations that's how the narrative

1717.84 --> 1722.0
for

1719.2 --> 1723.279
news and news media mainstream media

1722.0 --> 1726.0
actually work

1723.279 --> 1729.679
it's a process it's a think tank with

1726.0 --> 1731.279
humans but they do use ai probably to

1729.679 --> 1733.2
scour

1731.279 --> 1736.0
just everything

1733.2 --> 1737.2
to just rip data

1736.0 --> 1739.679
and

1737.2 --> 1742.48
but they're always just recycling the

1739.679 --> 1744.3200000000002
past always it's always a pure recycling

1742.48 --> 1746.3990000000001
the past operation

1744.32 --> 1749.039
because that way

1746.399 --> 1751.4399999999998
it's not going to be robotic or off it's

1749.039 --> 1753.76
always going to be a full

1751.44 --> 1756.0800000000002
fully developed thing that they're

1753.76 --> 1757.6
echoing right

1756.08 --> 1759.4399999999998
that's

1757.6 --> 1762.9189999999999
what the mainstream media does it's not

1759.44 --> 1762.919
the same thing

1774.559 --> 1780.399
whatever

1776.0 --> 1782.799
i'm talking about it whatever it is

1780.399 --> 1786.559
i'm just trying to pinpoint like where

1782.799 --> 1789.679
is ai actually being used and how

1786.559 --> 1792.84
ai is being used a lot guys a lot more

1789.679 --> 1794.72
than you'd expect because especially

1792.84 --> 1798.399
psychos

1794.72 --> 1800.08
power hungry egomaniacs

1798.399 --> 1804.1589999999999
devil worshipers

1800.08 --> 1806.559
they all like the ai you know why

1804.159 --> 1809.279
because the ai doesn't have a spirit

1806.559 --> 1811.039
that judges them and stares them in the

1809.279 --> 1813.279
face in the face through the other

1811.039 --> 1816.0
dimension every time they interact with

1813.279 --> 1820.08
it and they like that

1816.0 --> 1820.08
right they like ignorance

1820.399 --> 1827.12
but they also know the issues with ai

1824.08 --> 1829.12
and that is that it's very recognizable

1827.12 --> 1830.4799999999998
that it doesn't have the typical human

1829.12 --> 1832.4799999999998
cohesion

1830.48 --> 1834.88
so that's why they just use it for

1832.48 --> 1837.3600000000001
recycling operations

1834.88 --> 1839.6000000000001
mostly and it works they've been doing

1837.36 --> 1841.84
it for over a decade i'm pretty sure

1839.6 --> 1844.1589999999999
they have

1841.84 --> 1845.9189999999999
and you can already tell you can almost

1844.159 --> 1847.679
tell it's like

1845.919 --> 1848.48
sub ai

1847.679 --> 1852.0800000000002
right

1848.48 --> 1854.08
the main ai would be like oh weird

1852.08 --> 1855.6
sentence constructions

1854.08 --> 1858.1589999999999
right that's how you write this like ooh

1855.6 --> 1861.039
that's really ai that's weird that's off

1858.159 --> 1865.1200000000001
incohesive right or mainstream media

1861.039 --> 1867.2
narrative is sup incohesive

1865.12 --> 1868.9599999999998
because it is always structured like it

1867.2 --> 1871.1200000000001
is

1868.96 --> 1873.1200000000001
like a human could have said it but at

1871.12 --> 1876.08
the same time it has this weird cold

1873.12 --> 1878.2399999999998
robotic feel to it sometimes a little

1876.08 --> 1881.6789999999999
but not that you can directly pinpoint

1878.24 --> 1884.679
in its grav in its grammar use

1881.679 --> 1884.679
right

1894.799 --> 1897.039
right

1897.76 --> 1901.84
best shows are on free voice

1902.24 --> 1905.279
you mean

1903.279 --> 1906.48
quantum conscious channel

1905.279 --> 1910.0
website

1906.48 --> 1910.0
he has some pretty good videos

1912.08 --> 1915.84
although

1913.2 --> 1915.8400000000001
yeah it's

1918.84 --> 1926.559
yeah he does it in his way i think i

1922.399 --> 1926.559
feel like i'm definitely on par

1927.36 --> 1932.399
he does like basically spiritual

1929.76 --> 1932.399
mechanics

1932.559 --> 1936.32
and yeah i do that too

1938.88 --> 1942.88
but he's much more of a puzzler type of

1941.12 --> 1948.6
guy

1942.88 --> 1948.6000000000001
i'm just an oracle i just freaking do it

1948.96 --> 1954.679
in the moment

1950.24 --> 1954.679
every time we can't turn it off

1969.279 --> 1973.84
a bit like deep fakes

1972.0 --> 1977.679
well that's the thing like the deep

1973.84 --> 1980.0
fakes i think are having an influence

1977.679 --> 1982.3200000000002
like even the jokes that are made have

1980.0 --> 1985.44
an influence on the overall data

1982.32 --> 1989.279
preponderance that ai uses to draw its

1985.44 --> 1992.159
conclusions because even the ai

1989.279 --> 1994.159
well or the programmer of it

1992.159 --> 1997.2
is aware that

1994.159 --> 1999.44
comedy has an influence

1997.2 --> 2000.799
comedy sticks to mind

1999.44 --> 2004.159
right

2000.799 --> 2006.48
so it has an influence and deep fakes

2004.159 --> 2009.44
have a very weird influence even if

2006.48 --> 2009.44
they're just a joke

2012.0 --> 2015.679
like deep fakes i think

2014.88 --> 2016.8400000000001
make

2015.679 --> 2019.679
the ai

2016.84 --> 2022.399
squirt that sounds really weird by the

2019.679 --> 2023.76
way because they don't have like

2022.399 --> 2025.5189999999998
yeah

2023.76 --> 2028.0
but

2025.519 --> 2028.0
they do

2028.159 --> 2032.3990000000001
it's almost like

2030.559 --> 2033.84
maybe there's yeah this is this is

2032.399 --> 2035.84
getting like whoo

2033.84 --> 2039.039
science fiction territory right here but

2035.84 --> 2041.6789999999999
maybe the ai recognizes the deep fix as

2039.039 --> 2044.72
some kind of an attempt

2041.679 --> 2048.159
for for humans to communicate

2044.72 --> 2050.399
with their spirit

2048.159 --> 2053.119
maybe they see it as a bridge like hey

2050.399 --> 2056.56
that's typically what an ai would do but

2053.119 --> 2058.96
there's a human doing that

2056.56 --> 2061.04
it's a human doing that are they trying

2058.96 --> 2062.48
to communicate with us do they realize

2061.04 --> 2064.32
what we are

2062.48 --> 2067.04
how we are

2064.32 --> 2068.639
as i said science fiction

2067.04 --> 2070.399
but who knows

2068.639 --> 2074.2400000000002
how long is it going to take before that

2070.399 --> 2077.2799999999997
actually becomes real

2074.24 --> 2080.399
but i do notice that like comedy and

2077.28 --> 2082.32
deep fake videos have like a pretty

2080.399 --> 2085.359
profound influence

2082.32 --> 2085.3590000000004
that echoes on

2086.96 --> 2092.76
including on ai data gathering systems

2089.76 --> 2092.76
so

2102.57 --> 2105.679
[Music]

2108.64 --> 2112.64
real road dingers

2115.68 --> 2121.359
you mean like the warning bell

2119.599 --> 2124.52
when the train's coming yeah of course

2121.359 --> 2124.52
we do

2129.02 --> 2132.059
[Music]

2155.359 --> 2158.359
hmm

2162.48 --> 2168.88
manifesting the default 42 i'm okay

2166.88 --> 2171.04
so i don't

2168.88 --> 2175.0
i recognize the reference i don't fully

2171.04 --> 2175.0
understand the joke though

2187.599 --> 2192.1600000000003
anyway it seems like i made you all

2189.52 --> 2194.56
properly think again

2192.16 --> 2197.359
i always recognize that by suddenly

2194.56 --> 2200.52
everybody stops talking

2197.359 --> 2200.52
in chat

2204.4 --> 2209.44
tracks that don't have alarms yeah

2206.72 --> 2214.359
there's always a a sound

2209.44 --> 2214.359
thing going on the goods always

2235.839 --> 2241.88
the way globals go down is pure comedy

2238.72 --> 2241.8799999999997
to me

2242.32 --> 2248.56
yeah well comedy tragedy right it's all

2245.839 --> 2251.2799999999997
pretty close

2248.56 --> 2254.7999999999997
i can't help though but sometimes just

2251.28 --> 2257.2000000000003
feel that it's just tragic to them

2254.8 --> 2259.599
i mean when they go go really squirting

2257.2 --> 2260.3999999999996
or when they're like oh oh i can still

2259.599 --> 2262.4
win

2260.4 --> 2265.44
yeah that's funny that's really funny

2262.4 --> 2268.7200000000003
when they get old bravada

2265.44 --> 2270.2400000000002
right like religious bravada

2268.72 --> 2271.5989999999997
they get a big mouth that's kind of

2270.24 --> 2273.359
funny

2271.599 --> 2275.28
but most of the time i just feel it's

2273.359 --> 2277.7599999999998
like really tragic because they're just

2275.28 --> 2280.0
like all they just wanted was the earth

2277.76 --> 2284.8
to be a ball damn it

2280.0 --> 2287.119
why is that absolutely impossible

2284.8 --> 2290.32
like why couldn't like i'm still

2287.119 --> 2292.2400000000002
disappointed for baldwin not like

2290.32 --> 2293.6800000000003
like that i discovered that it wasn't

2292.24 --> 2295.2
actually a ball

2293.68 --> 2297.359
even though i've already learned it

2295.2 --> 2299.2799999999997
wasn't actually a ball

2297.359 --> 2301.68
but then i still hadn't let that

2299.28 --> 2304.2400000000002
actually consciously sink in

2301.68 --> 2306.3199999999997
and avoided that

2304.24 --> 2308.24
and then later i really figured out like

2306.32 --> 2310.0
[ __ ] it really

2308.24 --> 2313.3199999999997
really isn't the ball

2310.0 --> 2313.32
damn it

2313.92 --> 2318.2400000000002
i'm still bummed out by it in a way

2316.8 --> 2320.32
although yeah if it would have been a

2318.24 --> 2322.72
ball then the entire universe would be

2320.32 --> 2323.92
so [ __ ] up

2322.72 --> 2325.839
because

2323.92 --> 2328.0
well nothing about the ball makes sense

2325.839 --> 2330.48
so if that turns out to be the case then

2328.0 --> 2332.64
everything is really [ __ ] up

2330.48 --> 2333.52
and then nothing makes sense

2332.64 --> 2336.24
like

2333.52 --> 2337.92
night nature physics nothing makes sense

2336.24 --> 2340.8799999999997
if the earth was a ball

2337.92 --> 2345.119
so in a way i'm

2340.88 --> 2347.599
afterward happy about order

2345.119 --> 2350.079
i'm happy that there is order to the

2347.599 --> 2350.079
design

2350.48 --> 2355.839
right which really was not there with

2353.2 --> 2357.5989999999997
the ball earth

2355.839 --> 2359.04
but yeah then again they don't need it

2357.599 --> 2361.3590000000004
because they're all atheists and they

2359.04 --> 2364.72
believe in a big bang and nothing and

2361.359 --> 2367.72
it's all pointless and random

2364.72 --> 2367.72
so

2368.64 --> 2375.2
it is sad but they're so sure

2371.599 --> 2375.2000000000003
now they're just obsessive they just

2375.44 --> 2381.44
it's like gambling addiction right

2377.76 --> 2382.8
they've bet on it for so long

2381.44 --> 2385.52
even though they've already yeah

2382.8 --> 2389.8390000000004
especially because they've lost already

2385.52 --> 2389.839
so much they just don't want to stop

2389.92 --> 2394.4
they just want it back they just want to

2392.4 --> 2397.2000000000003
feel again like

2394.4 --> 2399.119
the earth really seems like a globe

2397.2 --> 2401.04
that's what they want back

2399.119 --> 2403.28
and they can't get it back so they just

2401.04 --> 2406.2799999999997
squirm and twist and

2403.28 --> 2406.28
project

2412.319 --> 2417.2
ai knows it's not a ball because of

2414.319 --> 2417.2
lidar data

2417.92 --> 2422.48
right

2419.839 --> 2423.2799999999997
yeah but because ai

2422.48 --> 2426.0
and

2423.28 --> 2427.599
like an advanced data gathering ai like

2426.0 --> 2429.44
really big ones

2427.599 --> 2432.079
that have oversight

2429.44 --> 2434.56
that can actually like judge

2432.079 --> 2436.4
reality about things

2434.56 --> 2438.56
they don't care

2436.4 --> 2441.04
they're just data gatherers they don't

2438.56 --> 2443.44
have like they're not programmed to have

2441.04 --> 2446.0
like emotional investment

2443.44 --> 2447.599
right an ai is not programmed

2446.0 --> 2450.079
to be

2447.599 --> 2452.319
confronted with unsolvable problems that

2450.079 --> 2454.4
they spend years and years on trying to

2452.319 --> 2456.96
figure out and then they're told it's

2454.4 --> 2459.119
actually it can't be solved

2456.96 --> 2461.839
that sort of [ __ ] doesn't happen and

2459.119 --> 2464.48
even if it does it will be like oh why

2461.839 --> 2466.56
did you waste my time

2464.48 --> 2470.319
and then just who cares because they're

2466.56 --> 2472.56
not programmed to have emotions

2470.319 --> 2472.56
right

2472.64 --> 2476.7999999999997
unless they are programmed to have

2474.48 --> 2479.119
emotions

2476.8 --> 2482.48
but that's more like social interaction

2479.119 --> 2483.28
bots not like figuring out reality bots

2482.48 --> 2485.359
because

2483.28 --> 2488.5600000000004
there's no use to give figuring out

2485.359 --> 2490.88
reality bots emotions

2488.56 --> 2493.88
that's only getting in the way

2490.88 --> 2493.88
right

2499.2 --> 2503.1189999999997
what are you talking about the tao

2505.119 --> 2508.839
what's with the dao

2519.599 --> 2523.839
that came out of nowhere flatter sage

2533.68 --> 2537.319
all right anyways

2545.32 --> 2548.469
[Music]

2555.92 --> 2558.92
um

2572.0 --> 2577.64
energy that powers this realm right it's

2574.319 --> 2577.64
life force

2578.0 --> 2584.0
it's it's like it's the thing that the

2580.96 --> 2586.0
idea of the force in star wars was based

2584.0 --> 2588.0
on

2586.0 --> 2589.68
yeah

2588.0 --> 2591.52
i call it the weave

2589.68 --> 2595.2
i think that

2591.52 --> 2597.44
the weave is also the thing

2595.2 --> 2601.1189999999997
that ties our spirits together and that

2597.44 --> 2601.119
actually gives us ability

2601.359 --> 2606.0
right without being able to tap into it

2603.52 --> 2608.61
if you have perfect isolation you're

2606.0 --> 2611.719
weakened by it automatically

2608.61 --> 2611.719
[Music]

2613.119 --> 2617.599
the spirit gets energy through the weave

2619.76 --> 2625.44
and can contribute energy and can

2623.04 --> 2627.44
take it away a bit

2625.44 --> 2629.119
can utilize whatever is there it can't

2627.44 --> 2634.04
really take it away but you can

2629.119 --> 2634.04
basically tap into things that are there

2638.72 --> 2644.52
new force is star wars

2640.88 --> 2644.52
it's not relevant

2647.32 --> 2650.4190000000003
[Music]

2650.56 --> 2655.2799999999997
and pantheism no it's atheism

2656.64 --> 2662.0
pantheism uh no there is no god

2659.599 --> 2664.96
providing power that we know as the

2662.0 --> 2666.64
force it's atheist it's

2664.96 --> 2668.56
that's what it is gagawa i don't know

2666.64 --> 2671.359
where you're getting this pantheism it's

2668.56 --> 2672.48
absolutely atheist

2671.359 --> 2675.52
right

2672.48 --> 2678.56
where's this god lore like where the

2675.52 --> 2680.56
[ __ ] in star wars ever do they even say

2678.56 --> 2685.359
the word god

2680.56 --> 2685.359
not a single time it doesn't exist there

2686.079 --> 2692.48
it's atheist the entire star wars

2688.8 --> 2694.319
universe is atheist

2692.48 --> 2696.56
and anytime there's any sort of

2694.319 --> 2698.319
reference to religion it's always just

2696.56 --> 2700.7999999999997
cult and it's always

2698.319 --> 2702.96
pooh-poohed every single time because

2700.8 --> 2707.119
everything about the star wars universe

2702.96 --> 2707.119
is pretty hardcore atheist

2714.4 --> 2718.92
so yeah guys

2715.92 --> 2718.92
wrong

2735.359 --> 2740.48
it can't completely be explained by

2737.52 --> 2742.88
material that's nonsense

2740.48 --> 2745.44
i mean you can't really pinpoint the

2742.88 --> 2747.44
essence but you can definitely describe

2745.44 --> 2750.4
it

2747.44 --> 2751.76
anything can be described anything

2750.4 --> 2754.079
anything

2751.76 --> 2755.92
like even god

2754.079 --> 2757.599
wouldn't recommend it though

2755.92 --> 2759.6800000000003
because you're always going to be short

2757.599 --> 2763.52
you're always going to run short

2759.68 --> 2766.3999999999996
right but even that part about it you

2763.52 --> 2769.52
can describe so everything can be

2766.4 --> 2769.52
described everything

2771.28 --> 2774.5600000000004
right

2772.4 --> 2776.7200000000003
and even if something is beyond your

2774.56 --> 2779.52
ability to describe you can still

2776.72 --> 2781.52
describe how it is beyond your ability

2779.52 --> 2782.8
to describe

2781.52 --> 2786.0
see

2782.8 --> 2786.0
anything can be described

2786.319 --> 2790.24
but not saying that you have to be able

2789.04 --> 2793.7599999999998
to do that

2790.24 --> 2796.4799999999996
it is complicated i know it is thou is

2793.76 --> 2796.48
complicated

2796.64 --> 2800.16
it's like chi

2798.319 --> 2801.2799999999997
it's also

2800.16 --> 2805.04
yeah

2801.28 --> 2805.0400000000004
that is also kind of complicated

2813.04 --> 2816.7599999999998
hey lydia logs

2822.72 --> 2826.48
everyone come in

2824.72 --> 2828.7999999999997
not what are you talking about adam

2826.48 --> 2828.8
price

2829.119 --> 2832.6800000000003
did i miss something

2849.2 --> 2854.319
oh yeah what you said earlier by the way

2852.24 --> 2856.4799999999996
about the trolls and their tactics that

2854.319 --> 2858.16
they make you callous towards them yes

2856.48 --> 2860.559
that's something that they like that's

2858.16 --> 2863.44
what they want

2860.559 --> 2865.2000000000003
right because if you get

2863.44 --> 2867.68
caught up in something

2865.2 --> 2870.0789999999997
you effectively lose control of whatever

2867.68 --> 2871.1189999999997
you were doing and then

2870.079 --> 2874.559
suddenly

2871.119 --> 2878.0
on a vast scale for all data analysis

2874.559 --> 2880.1600000000003
your behavior becomes more predictable

2878.0 --> 2882.88
right

2880.16 --> 2885.44
this is part of what's going on this is

2882.88 --> 2887.44
part of universal control

2885.44 --> 2889.119
if you distract something if you make it

2887.44 --> 2890.64
angry

2889.119 --> 2893.599
doesn't matter really what the scenario

2890.64 --> 2894.7999999999997
is it's always more predictable what

2893.599 --> 2898.48
will happen

2894.8 --> 2900.2400000000002
and it has vast fractal statistical

2898.48 --> 2902.48
implications

2900.24 --> 2902.4799999999996
right

2904.16 --> 2909.2
i mean i could imagine that and like

2906.16 --> 2910.7999999999997
really higher circles or lower circles

2909.2 --> 2912.3999999999996
depending on your perspective where

2910.8 --> 2914.96
there's a lot of power going on and

2912.4 --> 2917.6800000000003
money interest that they would literally

2914.96 --> 2920.48
at times like okay we need to send out

2917.68 --> 2921.839
the trolls now because the entire world

2920.48 --> 2923.04
situation

2921.839 --> 2925.359
is getting

2923.04 --> 2927.04
more refined more complicated we need to

2925.359 --> 2930.64
disrupt it we need to make everything

2927.04 --> 2932.079
more predictable so that our ai

2930.64 --> 2935.04
generator

2932.079 --> 2937.44
will give a more solid result that we

2935.04 --> 2940.319
can actually trust on right we need to

2937.44 --> 2943.119
send out the trolls

2940.319 --> 2945.359
ai real physical person we need to send

2943.119 --> 2947.839
them out to make everybody more

2945.359 --> 2950.7999999999997
predictable for a short time

2947.839 --> 2954.839
so that our ai will be able to roll out

2950.8 --> 2958.96
more reliable results

2954.839 --> 2958.96
yeah that's real

2959.359 --> 2963.7599999999998
something like that may have happened

2962.0 --> 2966.88
last weekend

2963.76 --> 2969.76
what hands forth all the trolls suddenly

2966.88 --> 2971.359
rolling out everywhere and i think it is

2969.76 --> 2976.2000000000003
related

2971.359 --> 2976.2
to the situation in canada

3002.48 --> 3006.8
no cowapul you're incorrect

3008.119 --> 3012.88
pantheist it's theist you know what

3010.96 --> 3013.92
theism is

3012.88 --> 3015.2000000000003
god

3013.92 --> 3018.2400000000002
gods

3015.2 --> 3022.16
pan multiple

3018.24 --> 3022.16
pantheism it's god's

3022.559 --> 3029.52
pantheism believes in gods it might not

3025.2 --> 3030.3999999999996
believe in one universal central creator

3029.52 --> 3032.079
right

3030.4 --> 3035.319
it just might believe that there are

3032.079 --> 3038.4
separate manifestations of it

3035.319 --> 3041.7599999999998
personifications of

3038.4 --> 3042.88
whatever has made everything somehow

3041.76 --> 3046.2400000000002
right

3042.88 --> 3050.1600000000003
pantheism gets a little weird like that

3046.24 --> 3052.64
but it is not atheism atheism literally

3050.16 --> 3056.0
denies all of it

3052.64 --> 3057.5989999999997
and there's no gods there's no little g

3056.0 --> 3059.839
gods either

3057.599 --> 3063.839
in star wars there's like really

3059.839 --> 3065.92
powerful individuals with a lot of power

3063.839 --> 3070.5589999999997
they're not god the only way they are

3065.92 --> 3074.2400000000002
god is through their megalomania

3070.559 --> 3076.8
nobody literally thinks they are gods

3074.24 --> 3079.2799999999997
because nobody believes in gods

3076.8 --> 3081.92
in star wars universe

3079.28 --> 3085.92
except for kooky stupid cultist or

3081.92 --> 3085.92
whatever if they even pop up ever

3089.44 --> 3091.68
so

3092.4 --> 3095.4
right

3096.16 --> 3101.68
i don't know how maybe maybe that's what

3098.64 --> 3104.4
they claim pantheism maybe a lot of star

3101.68 --> 3106.72
wars fans claim pantheism i don't know i

3104.4 --> 3108.7200000000003
don't know i just know

3106.72 --> 3110.0
from the movies

3108.72 --> 3112.5589999999997
right which is where it really

3110.0 --> 3116.68
originated from that they're pretty damn

3112.559 --> 3116.6800000000003
atheist all of it

3126.079 --> 3130.4
yeah gorzilla your shadow band there too

3128.72 --> 3133.2799999999997
yeah me too

3130.4 --> 3133.28
there's no more use

3135.2 --> 3143.04
i dude i've emailed jaron about no

3138.319 --> 3143.04
response no response whatsoever

3143.52 --> 3147.52
so either jaren literally doesn't give a

3145.92 --> 3150.559
[ __ ]

3147.52 --> 3153.119
or he doesn't like me or he thinks i'm a

3150.559 --> 3155.52
creep because i'm not media trained or

3153.119 --> 3157.6800000000003
he thinks that i'm secretly some evil

3155.52 --> 3159.68
person or whatever yeah i get a little

3157.68 --> 3162.0789999999997
freaky sometimes yeah i do that on

3159.68 --> 3162.0789999999997
purpose

3164.24 --> 3170.16
or maybe it's just bob and

3167.2 --> 3172.8799999999997
like the bob empire that's just like no

3170.16 --> 3175.68
he said something bad about me

3172.88 --> 3180.28
so now you are banned forever wherever i

3175.68 --> 3180.2799999999997
roam that could be it too

3192.96 --> 3198.48
i believe all the monotheistic religions

3195.04 --> 3198.48
have the same god yeah they do

3200.64 --> 3205.2
they actually do i mean

3203.2 --> 3207.1189999999997
this is the weird part from my

3205.2 --> 3209.2799999999997
perspective

3207.119 --> 3212.319
right

3209.28 --> 3214.8
god the creator is

3212.319 --> 3216.88
infinitely dynamic

3214.8 --> 3219.28
he has to be

3216.88 --> 3221.599
infinitely dynamic

3219.28 --> 3223.92
that means whatever you are going to

3221.599 --> 3227.44
face whenever you are going to worship

3223.92 --> 3229.6800000000003
it's effectively going to be him

3227.44 --> 3232.88
the thing is though he has actual

3229.68 --> 3236.72
mechanical rules through his design

3232.88 --> 3239.2000000000003
so if you are going to worship the devil

3236.72 --> 3241.2
you are going to well

3239.2 --> 3243.2
pay the price

3241.2 --> 3245.2799999999997
he's still going to

3243.2 --> 3247.9199999999996
allow that to happen he's going to

3245.28 --> 3251.28
probably like even skin it

3247.92 --> 3253.28
right be that devil partially or stare

3251.28 --> 3256.6400000000003
it around however that works this that's

3253.28 --> 3256.6400000000003
weird i don't know

3256.88 --> 3260.48
but there's always the rules the rules

3258.72 --> 3262.24
are the rules no matter what you do no

3260.48 --> 3265.839
matter what you worship

3262.24 --> 3268.7999999999997
if it's the rules it's the rules

3265.839 --> 3271.119
and yeah infinite dynamics you can get

3268.8 --> 3273.8390000000004
do you can do anything

3271.119 --> 3276.4
but in the end you will always pay the

3273.839 --> 3278.16
price that's the point that's how that's

3276.4 --> 3281.04
like

3278.16 --> 3281.04
that's how it works

3282.559 --> 3286.4
right so god

3284.559 --> 3289.3590000000004
yeah i'm not surprised he would just

3286.4 --> 3292.2400000000002
have one religion and the other religion

3289.359 --> 3295.04
and they traditionally wore

3292.24 --> 3296.64
even though they both have the same gods

3295.04 --> 3298.0
and need the same recognition of their

3296.64 --> 3300.0
roots

3298.0 --> 3302.48
and the rules

3300.0 --> 3305.44
right same roots the old testament like

3302.48 --> 3306.4
but still they are both

3305.44 --> 3309.28
with god

3306.4 --> 3312.4
and they're both without god

3309.28 --> 3313.6800000000003
because both recognize the real god

3312.4 --> 3317.28
but both

3313.68 --> 3318.3999999999996
have violations and priestly tricks that

3317.28 --> 3320.96
actually

3318.4 --> 3324.079
then detract from god

3320.96 --> 3324.079
and that's how it just

3324.319 --> 3329.7599999999998
will be able to just they will always

3327.119 --> 3330.88
attack each other's on both

3329.76 --> 3333.0400000000004
flaws

3330.88 --> 3336.6400000000003
right you did this wrong you did that

3333.04 --> 3338.64
wrong we would never do that oh yeah you

3336.64 --> 3340.8799999999997
say that but look at what you do over

3338.64 --> 3343.2799999999997
there with that and that and that

3340.88 --> 3344.96
oh you shut up you don't do that wrong

3343.28 --> 3346.4
no you do that wrong

3344.96 --> 3348.96
right

3346.4 --> 3350.64
and that's how people eventually just

3348.96 --> 3351.68
get caught up in

3350.64 --> 3354.4
in sin

3351.68 --> 3356.72
and fighting over sin

3354.4 --> 3361.7200000000003
with religions that are

3356.72 --> 3361.72
basically rooted in the same concept

3366.96 --> 3370.4
how does jaron have over a lot of subs

3369.599 --> 3372.6400000000003
well

3370.4 --> 3376.48
he's fred's very white steamy traveler

3372.64 --> 3378.64
he's also very media trained

3376.48 --> 3381.04
and

3378.64 --> 3382.319
he's into crypto and he's pretty good at

3381.04 --> 3384.88
it i hear

3382.319 --> 3386.88
i i wouldn't know i'm not i wouldn't be

3384.88 --> 3388.559
able to tell but

3386.88 --> 3389.44
so he's just

3388.559 --> 3392.48
he's

3389.44 --> 3395.359
going on a bit big platform right he

3392.48 --> 3397.44
which is very much beyond flat earth

3395.359 --> 3398.4
just saying

3397.44 --> 3400.88
right

3398.4 --> 3403.04
that's very separate from flat earth and

3400.88 --> 3404.88
he's really doing that and yeah that's

3403.04 --> 3408.319
gonna yield success

3404.88 --> 3409.599
because there's a lot a lot of people

3408.319 --> 3411.599
out there

3409.599 --> 3413.76
that are really desperate to learn more

3411.599 --> 3416.319
about bitcoin and

3413.76 --> 3418.96
crypto

3416.319 --> 3422.0
because like it's

3418.96 --> 3423.359
being mainstream pushed on everybody

3422.0 --> 3425.52
mainstream

3423.359 --> 3426.5589999999997
okay so there's a lot of people they're

3425.52 --> 3429.7599999999998
like oh

3426.559 --> 3433.76
i need to learn how to work this

3429.76 --> 3435.92
like millions and millions of people

3433.76 --> 3438.079
so yeah i'm not surprised that he has a

3435.92 --> 3440.64
big following now because that's part of

3438.079 --> 3440.6400000000003
what he does

3442.72 --> 3446.5589999999997
yeah jaren does know what he's doing i'm

3444.4 --> 3450.319
pretty sure that he does do like

3446.559 --> 3450.3190000000004
statistical research even

3454.799 --> 3459.92
to really make like wise business

3456.96 --> 3463.68
decision for his future and like what he

3459.92 --> 3463.6800000000003
will be doing on the internet

3466.4 --> 3469.839
they are the alex jones

3471.119 --> 3476.5
hmm

3473.47 --> 3476.5
[Music]

3477.839 --> 3485.24
i mean

3479.28 --> 3485.2400000000002
in a way but in ways definitely not

3512.64 --> 3515.64
gatekeepers

3516.16 --> 3518.64
are they

3519.28 --> 3523.76
i don't know

3521.04 --> 3523.7599999999998
are they really

3524.559 --> 3526.7200000000003
i

3527.28 --> 3533.8390000000004
like are they the gatekeepers or do they

3530.72 --> 3536.8799999999997
have gatekeepers among

3533.839 --> 3539.44
people that have interest in them

3536.88 --> 3539.44
i don't know

3541.359 --> 3544.48
i mean

3542.4 --> 3547.6800000000003
jaren no

3544.48 --> 3547.68
i don't like no

3548.88 --> 3553.92
he's never like shied away from saying

3551.68 --> 3556.72
something

3553.92 --> 3559.359
or saying a name or anything

3556.72 --> 3561.2799999999997
he's never been like oh don't do this no

3559.359 --> 3563.68
no no he's always like no do whatever

3561.28 --> 3566.1600000000003
you want i will do what i think is

3563.68 --> 3566.16
wisest

3566.64 --> 3570.72
and that means sometimes he's screwed up

3569.52 --> 3571.7599999999998
big time

3570.72 --> 3574.3999999999996
but

3571.76 --> 3576.1600000000003
always then afterward like

3574.4 --> 3578.559
learning about it recognizing his

3576.16 --> 3580.64
mistakes so no i think that jaren's not

3578.559 --> 3581.8390000000004
really a gatekeeper

3580.64 --> 3585.5989999999997
i mean

3581.839 --> 3585.599
some other people sure

3585.76 --> 3591.2000000000003
i mean i personally think that bob

3587.68 --> 3595.359
nodell is a freaking gatekeeper like a

3591.2 --> 3595.359
really really blatant one

3597.2 --> 3600.52
but yeah

3600.72 --> 3604.48
is that relevant to anything i don't

3602.319 --> 3606.88
watch him i don't even watch glowbusters

3604.48 --> 3606.88
anymore

3607.76 --> 3611.6800000000003
as in i haven't watched that in at least

3610.319 --> 3613.2799999999997
over a year

3611.68 --> 3615.9199999999996
that i've like last

3613.28 --> 3618.3190000000004
watched it a single time i don't even

3615.92 --> 3618.319
try

3623.44 --> 3626.799
ghostbusters what

3627.04 --> 3632.64
what the hell are you talking about

3629.76 --> 3632.6400000000003
ghostbusters

3635.68 --> 3641.24
you mean glow busters

3638.24 --> 3641.24
yeah

3645.52 --> 3651.68
no i think that globe busters is just

3648.48 --> 3656.52
a group that is hanging on to like the

3651.68 --> 3656.52
show having been out there for so long

3660.319 --> 3665.68
but i do not like the show at all

3664.079 --> 3667.44
the last time that i've

3665.68 --> 3670.48
watched it

3667.44 --> 3673.119
and actually like what i saw that must

3670.48 --> 3675.68
be like three years ago or four years

3673.119 --> 3675.6800000000003
ago now

3676.88 --> 3681.599
because the last time i looked it's just

3678.96 --> 3684.2400000000002
like just half the click away it's so

3681.599 --> 3686.48
terrible

3684.24 --> 3687.68
i mean i feel

3686.48 --> 3690.319
less

3687.68 --> 3692.0
screwed over when i when i just watch

3690.319 --> 3694.72
alex jones

3692.0 --> 3696.4
and yeah i'm pretty sure that alex jones

3694.72 --> 3700.5589999999997
has manipulations in there he is a

3696.4 --> 3700.559
gatekeeper but he's a very specific type

3704.16 --> 3708.0789999999997
s-u-s what does that mean

3711.76 --> 3715.44
right

3712.64 --> 3715.44
jared is great

3718.0 --> 3721.44
what do i think of the morgue

3722.11 --> 3725.44
[Music]

3724.4 --> 3728.559
guys

3725.44 --> 3732.88
i do not like the people on

3728.559 --> 3732.88
on the glow busters panel at all

3733.44 --> 3738.079
except for jiren but i like jaron the

3736.0 --> 3740.319
least when he's actually on glow busters

3738.079 --> 3743.559
he's much much better when he's just on

3740.319 --> 3743.5589999999997
his own

3759.52 --> 3764.16
i do dislike how many

3762.48 --> 3767.039
kevlar can you

3764.16 --> 3770.48
can you reformulate that in a consistent

3767.039 --> 3770.48
logical sentence please

3774.24 --> 3778.5989999999997
i don't understand what you're saying

3822.0 --> 3827.2
sus means suspect well maybe just say

3824.88 --> 3830.079
suspect right

3827.2 --> 3830.96
don't make a habit of shorts don't do

3830.079 --> 3833.599
that

3830.96 --> 3835.44
write it out

3833.599 --> 3837.44
write the thing out

3835.44 --> 3839.359
don't shortcut

3837.44 --> 3841.68
that's the the worst

3839.359 --> 3843.2799999999997
shortcut is the worst

3841.68 --> 3846.319
trait ever

3843.28 --> 3846.3190000000004
just write it out

3847.119 --> 3851.2000000000003
dude i'm not even english don't don't

3849.68 --> 3853.2
expect me

3851.2 --> 3855.1189999999997
if you're just gonna short something

3853.2 --> 3858.319
that i oh that means i'm gonna

3855.119 --> 3861.44
understand no write it out

3858.319 --> 3861.44
how much trouble is it

3862.48 --> 3866.64
yeah i know what in my opinion means

3864.96 --> 3868.559
yeah that's because i've been confronted

3866.64 --> 3871.2
with that for a long

3868.559 --> 3871.2000000000003
long time

3873.2 --> 3877.7599999999998
and it's kind of annoying to write it

3875.039 --> 3881.2000000000003
all out also most of the times you don't

3877.76 --> 3883.3590000000004
even have to say that it's just like oh

3881.2 --> 3884.64
i have to make cover for myself in my

3883.359 --> 3887.68
opinion like

3884.64 --> 3887.68
uh who cares

3889.839 --> 3898.0
but s-u-s is not universal for suspect

3895.28 --> 3898.799
that's ridiculous that's you

3898.0 --> 3902.119
just

3898.799 --> 3902.119
being sloppy

3914.88 --> 3919.839
they defend roman instead of different

3917.599 --> 3922.839
what

3919.839 --> 3922.839
really

3922.88 --> 3926.1600000000003
but

3923.76 --> 3927.92
wait who are you talking about

3926.16 --> 3932.0
kevlar

3927.92 --> 3934.319
are you talking about glow busters now

3932.0 --> 3935.76
this is fake

3934.319 --> 3936.0
don't up like

3935.76 --> 3937.2000000000003
they

3936.0 --> 3939.44
[Music]

3937.2 --> 3941.5989999999997
do did like who who are we talking about

3939.44 --> 3943.039
we're talking about we've been talking

3941.599 --> 3946.319
about like

3943.039 --> 3948.7200000000003
five ten different things in the last

3946.319 --> 3950.48
ten minutes like why would you assume i

3948.72 --> 3952.72
immediately know what you're talking

3950.48 --> 3952.72
about

3953.2 --> 3959.68
come on

3955.68 --> 3963.16
stop shorting stop being sloppy

3959.68 --> 3963.16
write it down

3972.559 --> 3977.119
like they defend like you're talking

3975.119 --> 3980.1600000000003
about glow busters you're talking about

3977.119 --> 3982.88
alex jones because i brought that up too

3980.16 --> 3983.68
he defends alex jones all the time that

3982.88 --> 3986.4
i mean

3983.68 --> 3988.48
he he's like oh my buddy rogan all the

3986.4 --> 3993.2400000000002
time

3988.48 --> 3993.2400000000002
so yeah who are you talking about

4006.72 --> 4012.72
i'm saying

4007.92 --> 4012.7200000000003
the talking point is about defending

4018.0 --> 4023.52
you mean that recent situation where oh

4020.72 --> 4024.799
somebody dug up how he said the word

4023.52 --> 4027.7599999999998
uh

4024.799 --> 4027.7599999999998
i hate that word

4030.559 --> 4037.2000000000003
because he's actually sicilian so he is

4033.599 --> 4037.2000000000003
like half that

4038.079 --> 4043.6800000000003
as owen benjamin basically laid out

4041.28 --> 4046.3190000000004
that nonsense situation like i don't

4043.68 --> 4049.839
give a [ __ ]

4046.319 --> 4049.839
i don't give a [ __ ]

4050.079 --> 4056.6400000000003
rogan is like a mega [ __ ] he's a

4053.28 --> 4058.799
satanist mega [ __ ]

4056.64 --> 4061.2799999999997
i don't understand how anybody thinks

4058.799 --> 4064.24
that he's right wing when he's blatantly

4061.28 --> 4067.039
a left-wing infiltrator

4064.24 --> 4069.1189999999997
in phil tretor

4067.039 --> 4071.92
he's one of the gayest

4069.119 --> 4075.799
most left-wing people

4071.92 --> 4075.799
in media ever

4079.68 --> 4084.72
the guy is a

4081.839 --> 4087.44
a sellout in many many ways and still

4084.72 --> 4089.7599999999998
people defend him because why because

4087.44 --> 4092.2400000000002
they think that he's somehow a secret

4089.76 --> 4095.3590000000004
infiltrator for their side

4092.24 --> 4098.3189999999995
wrong it's exactly the opposite he is an

4095.359 --> 4101.2789999999995
ultimate sellout ultimate sellout and he

4098.319 --> 4105.120000000001
loves it he loves doing that and he

4101.279 --> 4108.64
loves how people still believe in him

4105.12 --> 4111.96
because he's really disgusting

4108.64 --> 4111.96
and evil

4128.64 --> 4134.159000000001
right and it's getting worse it's

4130.839 --> 4136.88
getting rogan's getting bad to the point

4134.159 --> 4140.0
where i'm no longer if i no longer even

4136.88 --> 4143.52
find it amusing really to say rogan's it

4140.0 --> 4147.839
up like i'm it's becoming like

4143.52 --> 4147.839000000001
not funny anymore level

4155.759 --> 4160.199
how dare you how dare i what

4161.359 --> 4168.56
the rokun definitely has the bro

4163.679 --> 4171.759
mentality you mean he's a [ __ ] herder

4168.56 --> 4171.759
drug promoter

4173.04 --> 4178.0
freaky [ __ ]

4176.08 --> 4180.0
gay promoter like

4178.0 --> 4183.44
dude moon landing

4180.0 --> 4186.799
everything he's done is wrong everything

4183.44 --> 4189.12
oh so one stupid little nitpicky thing

4186.799 --> 4192.56
oh and now he's all good no he's a

4189.12 --> 4195.44
freaking sellout he's a sellout on any

4192.56 --> 4197.92
everything he sold you out to your face

4195.44 --> 4200.159
and you still liked him

4197.92 --> 4203.92
because he's like a psychopath it's just

4200.159 --> 4206.879999999999
like selling you out in his face

4203.92 --> 4209.76
and then you still like him that's him

4206.88 --> 4211.84
that's what he is that's what he does he

4209.76 --> 4214.88
likes that

4211.84 --> 4217.52
he likes to mentally rape you to your

4214.88 --> 4221.12
face and watch

4217.52 --> 4223.679
how you still love him for it

4221.12 --> 4227.08
she treats his audience his audience

4223.679 --> 4227.08
like gimps

4235.36 --> 4240.44
rogan treats his audience like gimps

4252.64 --> 4256.64
yeah andy hold my beer

4254.4 --> 4259.839999999999
right well that's the moment where it

4256.64 --> 4259.84
yeah that's when

4260.4 --> 4263.599999999999
when it all went to [ __ ]

4266.56 --> 4271.280000000001
right he had some interesting momentum

4268.88 --> 4273.52
up until that point and after that

4271.28 --> 4275.12
everything went to [ __ ] it's probably

4273.52 --> 4278.6
one of the last times he ever had a

4275.12 --> 4278.599999999999
natural boner

4289.199 --> 4294.48
because he's sold out

4291.76 --> 4295.360000000001
and now he treats his entire audience

4294.48 --> 4297.44
like

4295.36 --> 4300.0
gimps

4297.44 --> 4301.04
and he's amused by the stockholm

4300.0 --> 4305.199
syndrome

4301.04 --> 4305.199
of people that still stick to him

4311.679 --> 4316.2390000000005
good before that yeah sure

4313.679 --> 4319.28
yeah but everybody

4316.239 --> 4320.159
they all start out good don't they

4319.28 --> 4322.0
right

4320.159 --> 4325.92
it's not about starting out good it's

4322.0 --> 4325.92
about staying good

4326.0 --> 4333.679
staying it nobody gives a [ __ ] about how

4330.48 --> 4335.759999999999
you started good people only

4333.679 --> 4338.159
only matters of people i'm not talking

4335.76 --> 4340.0
about people people are freaking [ __ ]

4338.159 --> 4341.599999999999
and stockholm syndrome

4340.0 --> 4346.239
syndrome idiots

4341.6 --> 4349.360000000001
but what really matters is that you stay

4346.239 --> 4352.159
no matter the price

4349.36 --> 4354.799999999999
you stay good

4352.159 --> 4355.759999999999
it nothing matters about how you were

4354.8 --> 4357.76
good

4355.76 --> 4359.92
nothing about that is relevant to

4357.76 --> 4362.2390000000005
anything the only thing that's relevant

4359.92 --> 4365.2390000000005
is that you stay

4362.239 --> 4365.239
good

4373.76 --> 4376.76
um

4397.44 --> 4401.199
what's my opinion on eddie bravo

4403.199 --> 4407.919999999999
i think he's a pretty cool guy

4405.44 --> 4407.919999999999
overall

4409.6 --> 4415.4400000000005
i

4410.88 --> 4415.4400000000005
yeah i mean he is kind of like

4417.12 --> 4419.599999999999
i don't know

4420.64 --> 4425.84
i've never really seen anything of him

4422.88 --> 4427.679
that made me feel like oh he's poison or

4425.84 --> 4430.08
something right

4427.679 --> 4433.52
i mean he has like like

4430.08 --> 4436.4
quirks and [ __ ] in his social behavior a

4433.52 --> 4438.56
bit but i think he really is a good guy

4436.4 --> 4441.28
and he's not like looking to to buy

4438.56 --> 4445.52
tickets

4441.28 --> 4445.5199999999995
yeah i like eddie he's based i agree

4445.92 --> 4450.4800000000005
i haven't seen him in a while though i

4447.36 --> 4450.48
hope he's still like that

4450.88 --> 4458.76
he took the hell what are you talking

4454.64 --> 4458.76

4491.84 --> 4496.64
can't actually have clear and proper

4494.4 --> 4499.04

4496.64 --> 4503.92
people actually want to know about

4499.04 --> 4506.32

4522.239 --> 4527.28
the last period oh you got that yeah

4524.48 --> 4530.4
except my number of subscribers is

4527.28 --> 4532.96
exactly the same again for the last half

4530.4 --> 4534.32
year even though it constantly keeps

4532.96 --> 4536.56
telling me

4545.36 --> 4550.48
how many subs i have

4547.36 --> 4553.599999999999
my subscriber number does not represent

it doesn't it never will

4557.6 --> 4563.76

4561.52 --> 4566.159000000001
the only thing i could ever

4563.76 --> 4569.1990000000005
attempt to even change that is by

4566.159 --> 4571.5199999999995
completely abandoning youtube

4569.199 --> 4572.719
starting on another platform and then

4571.52 --> 4574.159000000001
hoping

4572.719 --> 4576.8
hoping

4574.159 --> 4580.799999999999
without guarantee that they aren't gonna

4576.8 --> 4580.8
gatekeep me like youtube is
