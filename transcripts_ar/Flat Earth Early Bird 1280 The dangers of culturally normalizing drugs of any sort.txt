as you all know

94.96 --> 97.27999999999999
right

97.439 --> 101.32
but today is

105.92 --> 111.2
it was kind of clear

108.0 --> 113.36
but then a lot of trails happen again a

111.2 --> 114.88000000000001
lot of them

113.36 --> 117.68
so now it's

114.88 --> 118.94999999999999
pretty quickly turned into this spray

117.68 --> 120.399
soup mostly

118.95 --> 124.2
[Music]

120.399 --> 124.2
which is kind of a shame

131.12 --> 135.84
so yeah

133.28 --> 137.52
seems like it's gonna be a bit cloudy

135.84 --> 139.04
today

137.52 --> 143.4
i don't know if it's gonna rain though

139.04 --> 143.4
it might in the evening again

146.83 --> 154.269
[Music]

156.879 --> 159.2
all right

159.36 --> 165.28
hello elise g first in chat

162.64 --> 165.27999999999997
good to see you

165.519 --> 172.20000000000002
it is

167.12 --> 172.20000000000002
the 21st of june 2022

172.4 --> 177.84
solstice

174.72 --> 177.84
if i'm not mistaken

181.28 --> 184.28
right

190.319 --> 193.28
yeah

191.519 --> 196.28
it is

193.28 --> 196.28
uh

225.599 --> 228.959
right

227.2 --> 231.2
so i don't know why but there's like

228.959 --> 233.68
tension

231.2 --> 233.67999999999998
again

234.4 --> 238.72
that i can feel

236.959 --> 241.84
i think there's a lot of tense happen

238.72 --> 241.84
things happening out there

247.28 --> 253.2
yeah and maybe it has to do with the

249.519 --> 255.59900000000002
solstice and the freaking chemtrailing

253.2 --> 257.759
because it is kind of weird that they

255.599 --> 260.15999999999997
would like completely spray everything

257.759 --> 260.959
and it's like everywhere

260.16 --> 264.24
like

260.959 --> 265.84000000000003
it's not just selective anymore

264.24 --> 268.24
most of the time it has been but it

265.84 --> 271.35999999999996
seems like they just lit

268.24 --> 273.759
everywhere you could just seen the lines

271.36 --> 276.639
this morning everywhere even at the

273.759 --> 278.639
horizon just everywhere

276.639 --> 283.84000000000003
so they decided

278.639 --> 283.84000000000003
to make it the completely clouded today

290.0 --> 294.32
yeah michael khan

291.84 --> 296.63899999999995
also had some footage

294.32 --> 300.32
how they were chemtrailing

296.639 --> 300.32
out there i think that's in england

300.56 --> 303.96
hello tonoid

313.14 --> 316.25
[Music]

345.84 --> 348.84
cheers

358.639 --> 361.96000000000004
all right guys

378.08 --> 383.59999999999997
yesterday's flat earth debate was epic

381.759 --> 387.28000000000003
by the way

383.6 --> 387.28000000000003
some of you might have caught the uh

387.52 --> 391.84
like the

388.56 --> 391.84
members only premiere

391.919 --> 396.0
if it went out already i'm not sure but

394.0 --> 399.84
yeah yesterday was like a four more

396.0 --> 399.84
hours type of show very long

400.0 --> 402.56
and

402.72 --> 409.16
there was some grilling

405.759 --> 409.16
was it again

413.68 --> 418.36
was it about coriolis again

422.479 --> 426.15999999999997
anyway it was it was a pretty awesome

424.88 --> 429.28
show

426.16 --> 434.52000000000004
a kind of a bit long eventually

429.28 --> 434.52
but nathan was grinding down good and

437.68 --> 440.8
that was pretty awesome

442.56 --> 445.199
hello

443.599 --> 446.8
dj d

445.199 --> 449.8
j

446.8 --> 449.8
637

452.639 --> 458.319
right also jim bob later

455.36 --> 458.319
had his mom on

459.039 --> 462.599
it's pretty cool

469.44 --> 474.4
i was just blasting it off in the chat

472.16 --> 474.40000000000003
there

474.879 --> 480.319
i mean

476.8 --> 484.0
i do get very inspired typically

480.319 --> 484.0
when jim bob's doing his streams

484.96 --> 490.0
and it's a very different setup as like

487.68 --> 492.879
doing my own show over here it's like

490.0 --> 495.28
i'm not that same person it doesn't work

492.879 --> 495.28000000000003
like that

496.4 --> 501.12
uh

497.44 --> 503.759
although yeah often i do wish i it did i

501.12 --> 506.56
wish i could have that

503.759 --> 508.96000000000004
that form and greatness you could say

506.56 --> 510.16
and had it just directly available to

508.96 --> 512.3199999999999
what i do

510.16 --> 513.839
problem is in reality i often find

512.32 --> 516.24
myself

513.839 --> 520.2
not in a position to be able to do that

516.24 --> 520.2
when i do my own shows

520.399 --> 523.599
like it doesn't work

524.64 --> 529.8389999999999
it only works for free when it's on

527.92 --> 532.24
somebody else's stuff and there is no

529.839 --> 535.839
possible way i could like

532.24 --> 538.24
cash in on it

535.839 --> 542.399
i don't know why

538.24 --> 542.399
it's extremely frustrating actually

543.519 --> 548.16
to realize that

545.76 --> 550.519
but yeah i gotta settle for what i have

548.16 --> 553.04
available to me energy-wise

550.519 --> 554.16
inspiration-wise as to what is coming

553.04 --> 557.36
right

554.16 --> 560.16
and what people bring to the table

557.36 --> 562.48
and for some reason my show

560.16 --> 564.64
on average and yeah i'm not complaining

562.48 --> 567.12
necessarily because it's yeah it's the

564.64 --> 567.12
format

570.88 --> 574.56
i don't seem to bring out

573.04 --> 577.68
that level

574.56 --> 579.1199999999999
of inspiration in others

577.68 --> 581.3599999999999
for some reason

579.12 --> 584.36
except for when i'm in the middle of it

581.36 --> 584.36
perhaps

598.08 --> 601.9200000000001
right

599.279 --> 604.16
but i think also part of the problem is

601.92 --> 606.88
it's just the financial dependency

604.16 --> 606.88
situation

606.959 --> 611.5999999999999
where i have found myself into like

612.56 --> 618.8
sometimes i think it would be better to

614.88 --> 620.48
just stop doing this show because it's

618.8 --> 622.7199999999999
been like

620.48 --> 624.72
just keep going right just keep going no

622.72 --> 626.399
matter what

624.72 --> 629.0400000000001
but

626.399 --> 631.36
i think that if i just stop doing it i

629.04 --> 632.8
might be able to kind of like get the

631.36 --> 634.88
enthusiasm

632.8 --> 637.5999999999999
level back

634.88 --> 641.36
as when i had it with my flatter talks

637.6 --> 641.36
when i did more like a weekly thing

642.079 --> 645.92
and there's still going to be the flat

643.68 --> 647.68
earth debates anyway i'm not gonna stop

645.92 --> 649.92
joining that

647.68 --> 651.68
on average

649.92 --> 654.399
right

651.68 --> 655.5999999999999
and maybe then also if i'd stop i could

654.399 --> 658.0
get my

655.6 --> 660.48
head cleared up to kind of like start

658.0 --> 662.64
doing other things

660.48 --> 666.399
out there maybe like

662.64 --> 668.959
more seriously try to get to know people

666.399 --> 668.959
out there

671.279 --> 674.64
all right

672.32 --> 677.279
but then still the financial situation

674.64 --> 677.279
is what it is

682.0 --> 686.64
now comes down to i have to get money

684.959 --> 688.4799999999999
from somewhere

686.64 --> 691.6
somehow

688.48 --> 691.6
and make it worth it

692.16 --> 697.92
not gonna just start cutting off things

695.36 --> 700.5600000000001
and like selling stuff just to get

697.92 --> 702.88
around like that never works

700.56 --> 704.7199999999999
never worked it never will work i'm

702.88 --> 705.68
never doing that

704.72 --> 708.32
ever

705.68 --> 710.4799999999999
again and i have done it and i'm like

708.32 --> 712.72
really sorry even that i did it back

710.48 --> 712.72
then

713.68 --> 718.4799999999999
it's like even if it's technically an

715.6 --> 721.2
option i'm just not doing it

718.48 --> 723.36
i'm choosing to starve instead because

721.2 --> 724.399
if i do that that would mean i would

723.36 --> 725.6800000000001
lose

724.399 --> 727.92
everything

725.68 --> 730.56
if i'd allow myself to do that i would

727.92 --> 734.16
just lose everything

730.56 --> 734.16
right so somehow

734.72 --> 737.36
i gotta

735.839 --> 739.0400000000001
financially

737.36 --> 740.88
get through this

739.04 --> 745.48
somehow

740.88 --> 745.48
somehow guys somehow

746.32 --> 749.6
yeah and all these little american

748.56 --> 751.92
tricks

749.6 --> 753.9200000000001
because americans love that

751.92 --> 756.3199999999999
they always come with suggestions you

753.92 --> 758.8
know why because in america that

756.32 --> 764.0
actually works it actually works in

758.8 --> 764.0
america yeah to do that it doesn't here

766.24 --> 772.639
this is europe this is the netherlands

769.6 --> 774.0500000000001
it doesn't work like that here we don't

772.639 --> 776.0790000000001
have the room

774.05 --> 776.959
[Music]

776.079 --> 780.16
and

776.959 --> 783.1999999999999
our bureaucracy is like

780.16 --> 783.1999999999999
much worse here

784.079 --> 788.4799999999999
besides soon as you actually start to

786.32 --> 790.48
get into the scope because you're

788.48 --> 792.639
standing out you're suddenly gonna get

790.48 --> 794.48
like a lot of trouble

792.639 --> 796.32
people are gonna try to get in your

794.48 --> 798.16
business

796.32 --> 801.839
on average

798.16 --> 801.8389999999999
it's just how it's all set up here

807.19 --> 810.32
[Music]

809.2 --> 811.279
so

810.32 --> 812.48
what

811.279 --> 815.8389999999999
the hell

812.48 --> 815.839
do i do

827.12 --> 830.32
you guys tell me

830.88 --> 833.76
or try

841.6 --> 846.0
you know that i've asked a lot of people

844.24 --> 847.519
throughout my life

846.0 --> 850.959
and not

847.519 --> 853.6
any one of them has ever

850.959 --> 854.56
actually tried to help me out and answer

853.6 --> 857.1990000000001
it

854.56 --> 861.1199999999999

857.199 --> 864.24
for yourself yeah oh that's great

906.92 --> 912.7199999999999
referring to

909.44 --> 913.6800000000001
what was said before i started this

912.72 --> 916.9590000000001

913.68 --> 916.959
introspective rant

are you though elishi i'm not sure maybe

976.48 --> 980.16

982.72 --> 986.88
the big freaking house and everything

989.6 --> 995.48

[Music]

1092.16 --> 1096.96

1094.559 --> 1100.32
similar situation

1096.96 --> 1100.32
i mean internally

1100.559 --> 1103.44
and practically

1104.4 --> 1109.72
i don't know

it's hard to tell

1113.919 --> 1118.72

1130.48 --> 1134.32
because i just can't focus it's like

1132.799 --> 1135.96
this

1134.32 --> 1138.6399999999999
physical

1135.96 --> 1141.679
demoralization sensation that's just

1138.64 --> 1141.679
there it's just there yeah

1145.12 --> 1151.84
i'm sick of it i wanted to stop

1165.919 --> 1170.96

1170.96 --> 1174.919
goddamn show

1182.559 --> 1189.6399999999999
it never happens outside of doing this

1186.0 --> 1189.64
[ __ ] show

1197.039 --> 1203.0
no not hunger pains

1200.0 --> 1203.0
anxiety

1203.12 --> 1209.76
i don't even know what what

1206.24 --> 1212.32
but we are no it's just pain

1209.76 --> 1212.32
it's like

1212.96 --> 1217.52
nervousness

1214.88 --> 1221.1200000000001
except i'm over it

1217.52 --> 1223.36
but it still doesn't it like hurts

1221.12 --> 1226.0
it's like more than nervousness and it

1223.36 --> 1228.0
doesn't stop

1226.0 --> 1230.799
it's like the only thing that actually

1228.0 --> 1234.0
works is to just go berserk it's like

1230.799 --> 1238.44
the outgoing [ __ ] berserk is the only

1234.0 --> 1238.44
thing that makes it stop hurting

1272.08 --> 1275.08
um

1277.84 --> 1282.6699999999998
[Music]

1305.52 --> 1311.6
yeah i don't know what it is dude

1308.24 --> 1314.4
i think that maybe just my empathic

1311.6 --> 1317.84
journey what i'm doing

1314.4 --> 1321.2
in combination with still well

1317.84 --> 1324.48
smoking and drinking not too much but

1321.2 --> 1327.6000000000001
still some it's like i don't live like a

1324.48 --> 1329.84
pure buddhist monk

1327.6 --> 1332.7199999999998
like

1329.84 --> 1335.28
and that in combination with using my

1332.72 --> 1337.28
apathy and dreamwalking i think this is

1335.28 --> 1339.6789999999999
literally like

1337.28 --> 1342.24
this is just a price

1339.679 --> 1343.2
i think it's gonna kill me if i keep

1342.24 --> 1347.84
going

1343.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
i i really feel like it might kill me

1348.88 --> 1357.1200000000001
my mother had something similar

1352.24 --> 1359.76
go [ __ ] yourself dude all a [ __ ] act

1357.12 --> 1362.0

empathy traits from her yeah she was

1372.64 --> 1378.0800000000002
suffering under it yeah yeah yeah

1374.799 --> 1380.1589999999999
yeah she died when she was 55

1378.08 --> 1383.84

1380.159 --> 1384.7990000000002
cancer throughout her belly yeah

1383.84 --> 1388.3999999999999

1447.12 --> 1451.84

1449.679 --> 1454.0800000000002
has an influence i know it does i know

1451.84 --> 1457.279
the smoking has an influence

1454.08 --> 1459.76
i just know it does

1457.279 --> 1461.52
i'm just trying to handle it

1459.76 --> 1464.64
trying to keep it

1461.52 --> 1467.76
like within safe limits and all that and

1464.64 --> 1470.24
and not to like oh escapism oh let's

1467.76 --> 1473.2

strict i'm like halfway doing the

1473.2 --> 1478.679
buddhist monk thing but it's only

halfway

1484.17 --> 1487.299
[Music]

1488.4 --> 1493.279
not a buddhist

1490.96 --> 1497.3600000000001
like a taoist

1493.279 --> 1497.36
i don't know what i'm doing anymore man

i just know that

1500.559 --> 1506.559
i watch movies guys guys

1504.08 --> 1508.559
remember yesterday

1506.559 --> 1510.96
i'm actually frustrated about this

1508.559 --> 1513.52
because i realized what happened

1510.96 --> 1515.76
yesterday when i was like oh what was i

1513.52 --> 1518.4
doing yesterday evening huh

1515.76 --> 1520.64
i don't really remember oh well yeah i

1518.4 --> 1523.279
watched a [ __ ] movie on

1520.64 --> 1525.279
recommendation of a kumu virus now yet

1523.279 --> 1528.96
no less

1525.279 --> 1532.64
some horror movie and it was horrific oh

1528.96 --> 1535.6000000000001
yeah oh but actually horrific i i

1532.64 --> 1539.1200000000001
[ __ ] had nightmares from that [ __ ]

1535.6 --> 1541.52
not during my sleep but during awake

1539.12 --> 1543.1999999999998
just [ __ ] in there that i can't get out

1541.52 --> 1545.279
of my head now

1543.2 --> 1547.3600000000001
and this tends to happen

1545.279 --> 1549.919
right it's the same yeah laugh it up

1547.36 --> 1551.6
akumu virus that movie was a piece of

1549.919 --> 1553.5200000000002
[ __ ]

1551.6 --> 1557.52
was terrible

1553.52 --> 1561.2
it was so the [ __ ] demoralizing man

1557.52 --> 1561.2
everything about it sucked

1562.4 --> 1566.799
i mean

1564.72 --> 1570.48
not the acting perhaps it's just that

1566.799 --> 1573.36
the story just sucked so hard

1570.48 --> 1575.679
it's that [ __ ]

1573.36 --> 1578.559
space in a color or something whatever

1575.679 --> 1578.5590000000002
the [ __ ] it was

1579.12 --> 1584.279
ridiculous title that doesn't make any

1581.279 --> 1584.279
sense

1585.919 --> 1592.4
and i forgot about it i had forgot about

1588.4 --> 1594.3200000000002
it luckily because it just sucked so bad

1592.4 --> 1595.52
it wasn't you

1594.32 --> 1599.279
oh

1595.52 --> 1601.52
okay i don't remember who i

1599.279 --> 1602.96
tried praying what the [ __ ] are you

1601.52 --> 1605.12
whining about

1602.96 --> 1607.76
doesn't work

1605.12 --> 1611.9599999999998
it does not work

1607.76 --> 1611.96
it's a physical thing

1614.64 --> 1617.6000000000001
all right yeah

1619.679 --> 1624.72
but yeah

1621.36 --> 1629.1999999999998
i just get plagued by that [ __ ]

1624.72 --> 1629.2
i shouldn't even like take risks anymore

1629.279 --> 1633.52
tips

1631.039 --> 1637.6
from people and watching movies and

1633.52 --> 1640.399
because i just can't handle it anymore

1637.6 --> 1644.8799999999999
it gets to me

1640.399 --> 1644.8799999999999
and it's ridiculous that it gets to me

1645.84 --> 1650.0
i mean it's like my empathy is just

1650.96 --> 1659.039
maybe getting out of control sometimes

1654.08 --> 1661.6
i [ __ ] catch myself trying to just

1659.039 --> 1664.64
get into corners of thinking where i

1661.6 --> 1667.52
literally don't want to go and my

1664.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
[ __ ] mind just goes there

1667.52 --> 1672.0
and i don't even realize it is like what

1669.84 --> 1674.0
the [ __ ] are you doing there you

1672.0 --> 1676.399
shouldn't be thinking about that you

1674.0 --> 1678.08
[ __ ] ass

1676.399 --> 1683.9189999999999
stop it

1678.08 --> 1683.9189999999999
ignore it stop thinking about it

1689.919 --> 1693.72
yes i have a passport

1699.55 --> 1702.68
[Music]

1708.48 --> 1714.0
it's just this [ __ ] feeling in my

1710.88 --> 1716.7990000000002
belly man it ruins everything like i

1714.0 --> 1719.279
i feel it's like tied in

1716.799 --> 1721.68
with my terrible moods

1719.279 --> 1723.679
because every time i have it

1721.68 --> 1724.799
[Music]

1723.679 --> 1726.5590000000002
always

1724.799 --> 1729.039
end up just

1726.559 --> 1735.1589999999999
doing this getting [ __ ] pissed off it

1729.039 --> 1735.1589999999999
always happens when i [ __ ] feel this

1742.799 --> 1747.2
[ __ ] you akumu virus don't bring it up

1748.159 --> 1752.7600000000002
don't want to talk about it

1755.12 --> 1758.9189999999999
it's just horrible

1763.98 --> 1767.799
[Music]

1770.32 --> 1776.399
so yes saw move but that's so upfront

1773.76 --> 1778.72
like dude i'm never gonna watch that

1776.399 --> 1778.7199999999998
ever

1779.6 --> 1783.6
saw is just disgusting

1784.65 --> 1787.799
[Music]

1793.279 --> 1798.799
all right but even in this movie at the

1795.279 --> 1800.64
preliminary it was just like this

1798.799 --> 1803.2
the main character what the [ __ ] is the

1800.64 --> 1806.3990000000001
actor's name again i usually think he's

1803.2 --> 1806.3990000000001
pretty hilarious in

1807.44 --> 1811.3600000000001
damn movies what's his name again

1812.0 --> 1818.559
okay this is a cheap shot but not the

1814.399 --> 1822.1589999999999
bees not the bees yeah that actor

1818.559 --> 1824.399
god damn it why do i forget his name so

1822.159 --> 1825.919
stupid

1824.399 --> 1826.799
uh

1825.919 --> 1829.3600000000001
but

1826.799 --> 1831.039
necklace cage that's right yeah he is

1829.36 --> 1834.0
like the main character in this and he's

1831.039 --> 1837.84
like this [ __ ] gamma dad

1834.0 --> 1839.039
he's so gamma it's like ah you deserve

1837.84 --> 1840.8799999999999
this

1839.039 --> 1843.44
i ended like i watched this movie and

1840.88 --> 1846.48
i'm like you [ __ ] deserve this you

1843.44 --> 1850.72
damn a piece of [ __ ]

1846.48 --> 1853.84
you deserve this for your negligence

1850.72 --> 1853.84
i hated him

1854.08 --> 1859.1999999999998
i hated him

1856.48 --> 1862.159
in that movie

1859.2 --> 1862.159
[ __ ] hell

1862.559 --> 1867.24
he was so negligent

1867.84 --> 1871.6789999999999
and like

1869.36 --> 1871.6789999999999
ah

1873.85 --> 1879.12
[Music]

1876.24 --> 1882.32
then well yeah now we need to watch it

1879.12 --> 1882.32
y'all go [ __ ] yourself

1883.76 --> 1888.0
i don't want to watch it

1885.6 --> 1890.9599999999998
i didn't even want to bring it up

1888.0 --> 1893.84
now only because of my whiny complaining

1890.96 --> 1896.32
nature pain in my [ __ ] belly i had to

1893.84 --> 1900.24
bring it up again and now other people

1896.32 --> 1900.24
are going to watch that piece of [ __ ]

1905.039 --> 1909.2
yeah it's not about nikola i just hated

1907.36 --> 1911.6
the character

1909.2 --> 1914.0
i think nicholas cage is pretty

1911.6 --> 1917.279
interesting actor and he's really

1914.0 --> 1917.279
freaking funny sometimes

1917.6 --> 1922.24
and he goes all crazy and [ __ ] but

1922.399 --> 1928.7199999999998
it's just this movie i really

1925.279 --> 1928.72
[ __ ] hated it

1931.279 --> 1938.399
and i felt like extra miserable

1933.84 --> 1941.279
afterward like it was so miserable

1938.399 --> 1944.279
and it started already like terribly

1941.279 --> 1944.279
wrong

1955.679 --> 1959.279
his acting methods are interesting yeah

1957.44 --> 1962.72
but that's because he has a lot of

1959.279 --> 1963.919
emotions that he just pours into his act

1962.72 --> 1966.08
he'll just

1963.919 --> 1967.2
he can basically go hysterical on

1966.08 --> 1968.8799999999999
command

1967.2 --> 1971.519
it's pretty impressive

1968.88 --> 1973.8400000000001
i mean i think it is a form of character

1971.519 --> 1973.84
acting

1974.24 --> 1977.559
what he does

1981.679 --> 1985.44
although sometimes he's just not into it

1983.919 --> 1989.679
in a movie

1985.44 --> 1991.919
then he just kind of stays a bit like uh

1989.679 --> 1996.1200000000001
other times he's like really into it and

1991.919 --> 1996.1200000000001
then he goes all nutty

2007.039 --> 2010.24
all right whatever

2016.799 --> 2021.12
it was still bothering me from yesterday

2019.279 --> 2023.12
i don't really want to even talk about

2021.12 --> 2025.1999999999998
movies

2023.12 --> 2028.799
i mostly want to just talk about flat

2025.2 --> 2028.799
earth and complicated [ __ ]

2029.039 --> 2033.84
i want high

2030.559 --> 2033.84
level questions

2071.359 --> 2077.7599999999998
hello jason brown by the way

2074.879 --> 2079.1189999999997
i think i'm getting better

2077.76 --> 2083.44
it's so

2079.119 --> 2085.76
incredibly annoying that feeling

2083.44 --> 2087.2000000000003
might i finally be going

2085.76 --> 2090.32
look dude

2087.2 --> 2094.72
it's almost an hour like how can i just

2090.32 --> 2097.44
do a show when it's like an hour of that

2094.72 --> 2099.9199999999996
i can't do it anymore

2097.44 --> 2104.32
if this just persists that i just can't

2099.92 --> 2104.32
do it it just hurts too much

2108.72 --> 2114.2
40 min yeah but it was it started at one

2117.599 --> 2121.3590000000004
like it's

2118.8 --> 2123.599
it's partially the reason sometimes why

2121.359 --> 2125.7599999999998
i start late it's not like oh [ __ ] i'm

2123.599 --> 2127.3590000000004
not in time i'm rushing back to start no

2125.76 --> 2129.44
it's because

2127.359 --> 2131.52
oh [ __ ] there it is again

2129.44 --> 2132.8
let's see if i can get it under control

2131.52 --> 2135.119
this time

2132.8 --> 2140.0
that's why i'm late

2135.119 --> 2140.0
not because i'm all short on time

2140.079 --> 2145.28
it's because i just feel

2142.4 --> 2148.2400000000002
something feels wrong

2145.28 --> 2150.48
and try to get over that that's why i'm

2148.24 --> 2153.4799999999996
late to the shows

2150.48 --> 2153.48
okay

2161.34 --> 2164.53
[Music]

2181.68 --> 2187.7999999999997
who discovered the second law of

2183.599 --> 2187.8
thermodynamics what

2190.88 --> 2196.7200000000003
that is but yeah that's more like a

2192.88 --> 2196.7200000000003
historical question i don't know

2198.8 --> 2200.96
let

2206.11 --> 2210.829
[Music]

2212.0 --> 2216.8
and william thompson kelvin

2215.119 --> 2219.2000000000003

2216.8 --> 2220.7200000000003
both first law and the second law of

2219.2 --> 2223.68
thermodynamics

2220.72 --> 2226.68
in 1850

2223.68 --> 2226.68
cool

2237.04 --> 2241.56
based on the concept of entropy

2265.119 --> 2270.079
and it's interesting historically the

2267.2 --> 2272.96
second law was an empirical finding that

2270.079 --> 2276.4
was accepted as an axiom

2272.96 --> 2280.56
of thermodynamic theory

2276.4 --> 2280.56
it's an interesting way of saying it

2283.28 --> 2289.0400000000004
um yeah thanks for that question nakumu

2285.76 --> 2289.0400000000004
virus i appreciate that

2291.359 --> 2295.68
cannabis help stomach but yeah not this

2293.599 --> 2300.839
one though

2295.68 --> 2300.839
it doesn't james jason brown it doesn't

2338.88 --> 2343.28
yeah it's weird jason brown because

2341.2 --> 2346.0
it's actually it seems even to be like

2343.28 --> 2346.0
the opposite

2346.48 --> 2351.359
sometimes

2348.8 --> 2355.8390000000004
i almost feel like it's almost cost by

2351.359 --> 2355.839
actually smoking before i do the show

2357.68 --> 2361.359
and then sometimes it just doesn't

2364.4 --> 2369.92
so maybe maybe for me it's now time to

2367.28 --> 2372.7200000000003
like really stop the routine that i've

2369.92 --> 2375.119
had and like seriously cut down on the

2372.72 --> 2377.5989999999997
amount that i smoke just like really

2375.119 --> 2379.92
dramatically cut it down

2377.599 --> 2381.599
and then see if this [ __ ] goes away

2379.92 --> 2383.839
because it's

2381.599 --> 2383.839
just

2386.0 --> 2390.28
it's not fun anymore

2399.44 --> 2403.359
oh freezer bring downs

2401.44 --> 2405.599
brings entropy down

2403.359 --> 2405.5989999999997
what

2407.599 --> 2412.079
now that brings the temperature out

2412.8 --> 2416.079
right

2413.68 --> 2418.7999999999997
through pressurized pressurization

2416.079 --> 2421.2000000000003
depressurization

2418.8 --> 2421.2000000000003
and then

2422.48 --> 2426.4
temperature radiation

2424.64 --> 2430.7599999999998
right

2426.4 --> 2430.76
it is fascinating how it works

2450.88 --> 2453.839
one

2461.52 --> 2465.8
yeah that's right metal slugs cockatio

2466.56 --> 2471.44
right

2467.839 --> 2473.92
it's just that it passively

2471.44 --> 2475.04
hot goes to cold high pressure to low

2473.92 --> 2477.04
pressure

2475.04 --> 2479.359
but yeah that doesn't mean that that

2477.04 --> 2480.48
cannot be artificially

2479.359 --> 2482.56
altered

2480.48 --> 2484.079
but that's not a contradiction of the

2482.56 --> 2486.4
second law

2484.079 --> 2489.52
it's just

2486.4 --> 2492.0
actively being done

2489.52 --> 2494.88
there's like an agency to do

2492.0 --> 2498.48
something different

2494.88 --> 2500.319
right but second law still applies

2498.48 --> 2502.96
because in the past in any passive

2500.319 --> 2504.319
scenario hot is always going to go to

2502.96 --> 2506.0
cold and

2504.319 --> 2507.7599999999998
high pressure is always going to try to

2506.0 --> 2511.079
go to low pressure that's just always

2507.76 --> 2511.079
how it works

2548.079 --> 2551.079
hmm

2557.2 --> 2561.359
okay that's interesting

2559.839 --> 2562.72
the l

2561.359 --> 2565.92
oh god

2562.72 --> 2567.04
but you can't just get a real name

2565.92 --> 2568.7200000000003
uh

2567.04 --> 2570.0
but yeah

2568.72 --> 2572.319
interesting

2570.0 --> 2573.28
would you say that thc lowers blood

2572.319 --> 2576.12
sugar

2573.28 --> 2582.719
nicotine raises it

2576.12 --> 2582.719
[Music]

2614.0 --> 2617.0
hmm

2628.4 --> 2633.359
okay slugs i didn't know that

2631.68 --> 2636.72
i don't always notice that i don't

2633.359 --> 2639.2
really get hungry from alcohol

2636.72 --> 2639.2
actually

2641.839 --> 2647.7999999999997
well yeah maybe in the past i did when i

2644.56 --> 2647.7999999999997
was younger

2653.44 --> 2659.04
but then again i did used to drink more

2657.44 --> 2662.839
then yeah i'm getting influenced more

2659.04 --> 2662.839
then yeah i get hungry

2703.839 --> 2706.16
hmm

2715.599 --> 2720.76
okay that's interesting that's slugs

2717.44 --> 2720.76
coca deal

2740.4 --> 2745.04
all right i could move ours you gonna

2742.0 --> 2747.839
walk the dog then

2745.04 --> 2747.839
nice

2755.75 --> 2758.809
[Music]

2788.24 --> 2793.2799999999997
wow yeah imagine

2790.079 --> 2793.28
dude that sounds

2793.52 --> 2799.68
yeah excess excessive alco but that's

2796.48 --> 2801.92
just straight out poisoning though right

2799.68 --> 2804.8799999999997
if you realize that alcohol is like a

2801.92 --> 2806.64
fat dissolvent and like

2804.88 --> 2810.319
your brain is

2806.64 --> 2813.04
a lot of fat and other like vital organ

2810.319 --> 2816.0
parts and like yeah

2813.04 --> 2819.359
it's kind of dangerous

2816.0 --> 2819.359
don't drink too much

2819.599 --> 2824.7200000000003
you know always very

2821.76 --> 2824.7200000000003
aware of that

2825.119 --> 2830.319
and yeah i'm very sensitive to alcohol

2827.359 --> 2832.7999999999997
so i don't need to drink too much anyway

2830.319 --> 2835.2799999999997
i i would just get sick

2832.8 --> 2835.28
quickly

2836.64 --> 2841.2
and i guess that makes me the lucky one

2838.64 --> 2843.52
because those that don't just get sick

2841.2 --> 2846.48
quickly well they might end up chugging

2843.52 --> 2848.16
and then really getting poisoning really

2846.48 --> 2851.28
getting the poison even though they

2848.16 --> 2853.839
might not notice it that much

2851.28 --> 2856.079
they're still gonna get the poisoning

2853.839 --> 2859.44
i don't get it as much because i just

2856.079 --> 2862.8390000000004
never end up drinking that much

2859.44 --> 2862.839
lucky me

2913.92 --> 2919.599
yeah pgc that yeah

2917.44 --> 2922.599
well yes it's

2919.599 --> 2922.599
vocalism

2958.8 --> 2963.559
right

2960.559 --> 2963.559
anyhow

2984.96 --> 2987.96
uh

3010.72 --> 3013.72
uh

3016.96 --> 3021.8
what the hell is the mic picking that up

3026.64 --> 3029.1189999999997
what the

3030.16 --> 3037.72
is the filter changed or something

3034.319 --> 3037.72
this is weird

3056.16 --> 3059.16
hmm

3069.839 --> 3072.72
all right anyhow

3073.2 --> 3076.72
i'm getting better slowly

3079.119 --> 3082.6800000000003
it's just

3109.44 --> 3113.359
what the [ __ ] jason brown

3113.92 --> 3118.319
legalized hello synergetics no

3118.48 --> 3121.599
no

3120.12 --> 3122.64
[Music]

3121.599 --> 3125.839
like

3122.64 --> 3125.839
what good is that gonna do

3163.359 --> 3167.119
by the way like making alcohol illegal

3166.079 --> 3170.6400000000003
like

3167.119 --> 3170.6400000000003
what do you think that's gonna do

3172.82 --> 3175.9590000000003
[Music]

3177.2 --> 3181.24
that it just doesn't work

3210.88 --> 3214.88
that's right making illegal creates a

3212.8 --> 3216.6400000000003
huge black mark marketer yeah that's

3214.88 --> 3219.2000000000003
right

3216.64 --> 3220.7999999999997
so what happens

3219.2 --> 3223.04
so the best thing

3220.8 --> 3225.76
in general i think even on to the future

3223.04 --> 3225.7599999999998
is to not

3226.079 --> 3232.96
necessarily make it illegal just make

3230.64 --> 3235.68
being under influence

3232.96 --> 3238.8
in public right and like

3235.68 --> 3242.0789999999997
harassing others or

3238.8 --> 3244.48
just being like wasted on the street

3242.079 --> 3247.04
that should be illegal

3244.48 --> 3249.04
absolutely

3247.04 --> 3250.5589999999997
but if you're just gonna make drugs

3249.04 --> 3254.079
illegal then

3250.559 --> 3255.52
that's usually just gonna play into

3254.079 --> 3257.28
criminals

3255.52 --> 3259.7599999999998
that are just gonna make more money

3257.28 --> 3259.76
because of

3262.839 --> 3269.2
that but never

3266.24 --> 3269.2
no ed phrase

3274.88 --> 3281.0
i know they're out there

3277.2 --> 3281.0
i'm not doing it

3295.28 --> 3301.44
how is this funny jason brown

3298.799 --> 3304.4
how is that funny you know how freaking

3301.44 --> 3304.4
dangerous that is

3305.359 --> 3308.64
you can't

3306.4 --> 3310.96
normalize that

3308.64 --> 3314.0789999999997
if you do that

3310.96 --> 3315.2
it's going to be devastating

3314.079 --> 3317.92
i mean

3315.2 --> 3318.799
alcohol is pretty shitty right can be

3317.92 --> 3321.2000000000003
bad

3318.799 --> 3324.319
people can get addicted to it

3321.2 --> 3327.2
but if you normalize this there's gonna

3324.319 --> 3330.16
be people are like gonna go and lose

3327.2 --> 3332.64
their minds just completely

3330.16 --> 3333.5989999999997
and like get

3332.64 --> 3337.359
like

3333.599 --> 3337.3590000000004
into very serious trouble

3337.44 --> 3340.319
like they're gonna become mentally

3339.119 --> 3342.799
deranged

3340.319 --> 3344.88
i mean alcoholics are like

3342.799 --> 3347.839
tend to be a bit weak in their

3344.88 --> 3350.319
characteristics

3347.839 --> 3353.119
people that like if everybody just gets

3350.319 --> 3355.839
lsd and all that addicted

3353.119 --> 3359.2000000000003
they'll like really become demonically

3355.839 --> 3361.92
deranged some of them much much worse

3359.2 --> 3364.3999999999996
than any alcohol it could ever become

3361.92 --> 3364.4
okay

3365.28 --> 3369.2000000000003
yeah microdosing is a thing yeah that's

3367.119 --> 3371.2000000000003
really cute

3369.2 --> 3375.0
no thank you

3371.2 --> 3375.0
i'm not doing it

3376.96 --> 3382.88
yeah and i'm not doing any medically

3379.119 --> 3382.88
prescribed drugs either

3387.68 --> 3391.3999999999996
this is not funny

3417.2 --> 3421.839
dude all alice energetics does

3420.319 --> 3424.799
on average

3421.839 --> 3428.5589999999997
is take you more

3424.799 --> 3430.48
out of the real world into your fantasy

3428.559 --> 3433.28
world in your head

3430.48 --> 3436.96
it's just gonna disconnect the people

3433.28 --> 3440.88
more that's what's gonna happen

3436.96 --> 3443.52
it's gonna turn a people into zombies

3440.88 --> 3446.0
because they'll all be disconnected and

3443.52 --> 3448.24
before you know it nobody can connect up

3446.0 --> 3450.88
to every anybody anymore and everybody's

3448.24 --> 3453.359
just like surrounded by people and

3450.88 --> 3455.599
everybody is alone

3453.359 --> 3459.44
that's the end result

3455.599 --> 3460.4
if you normalize hello synergetics

3459.44 --> 3463.119
it is

3460.4 --> 3464.319
that's what happens it's already

3463.119 --> 3466.6400000000003
happening

3464.319 --> 3467.92
places where it is normalized it's

3466.64 --> 3473.96
happening

3467.92 --> 3473.96
measurably palpably it's right there

3478.24 --> 3484.319
you can't normalize it

3481.68 --> 3488.3999999999996
you just can't do that it's

3484.319 --> 3490.96
horrific if you do that it's criminal

3488.4 --> 3492.88
if you do that like on a spiritual level

3490.96 --> 3494.4
that's criminal

3492.88 --> 3496.88
it is

3494.4 --> 3499.599
if you watch blueberry

3496.88 --> 3502.6400000000003
you would understand that

3499.599 --> 3504.559
i got a suspicion that the castanada

3502.64 --> 3506.64
book is about that too because that the

3504.559 --> 3509.2000000000003
freaking first page already hinted at

3506.64 --> 3511.2799999999997
this like oh oh it's gonna be about

3509.2 --> 3513.5989999999997
peyote or something

3511.28 --> 3514.88
okay so it is kind of like a blueberry

3513.599 --> 3517.52
story then

3514.88 --> 3520.96
perhaps or maybe blueberry was like

3517.52 --> 3524.799
based on that book or something in a way

3520.96 --> 3528.079
i don't know i gotta read it further

3524.799 --> 3531.359
but you can't normalize it

3528.079 --> 3533.8390000000004
these things are were originally

3531.359 --> 3536.16
regarded as holy

3533.839 --> 3539.599
holy experiences

3536.16 --> 3541.92
holy experiences are not a [ __ ] party

3539.599 --> 3545.599
drug you [ __ ]

3541.92 --> 3546.559
they're to be taken very seriously like

3545.599 --> 3550.799
big

3546.559 --> 3553.3590000000004
trials in your life with heavy weights

3550.799 --> 3554.559
and a serious mind

3553.359 --> 3557.839
okay

3554.559 --> 3563.0400000000004
it's not a [ __ ] party drug yeah

3557.839 --> 3565.599
that's just gonna turn you into a zombie

3563.04 --> 3567.92
because you did not prepare you didn't

3565.599 --> 3570.2400000000002
have a mission you didn't have

3567.92 --> 3572.88
the skills

3570.24 --> 3575.2
given to you as you entered it

3572.88 --> 3577.44
and then demons come and they take

3575.2 --> 3580.799
everything away from you

3577.44 --> 3582.7200000000003
and you won't even miss it

3580.799 --> 3583.599
because you'll be disconnected from the

3582.72 --> 3586.24
world

3583.599 --> 3588.2400000000002
and then you'll start longing for that

3586.24 --> 3591.2
disconnection of the world and you will

3588.24 --> 3592.64
have no more empathy for the world

3591.2 --> 3596.48
before you know it

3592.64 --> 3598.5589999999997
you're a demon in a human body

3596.48 --> 3601.04
and your spirit is stuck in a dream that

3598.559 --> 3602.559
has nothing to do with reality anymore

3601.04 --> 3604.96
and your body

3602.559 --> 3607.2000000000003
just goes along to get along and does

3604.96 --> 3609.52
most atrocious things that with your

3607.2 --> 3610.799
consciousness you wouldn't even want to

3609.52 --> 3612.72
realize that that is what you're

3610.799 --> 3616.799
actually doing yeah

3612.72 --> 3618.9599999999996
that's what happens when you normalize

3616.799 --> 3623.079
hallucinogenics

3618.96 --> 3623.079
don't do that

3632.64 --> 3635.64
ugh

3651.839 --> 3656.44
yeah that's really cute at face

3656.799 --> 3660.52
i'm not doing it

3673.92 --> 3679.119
affect your senses and emotions slightly

3676.079 --> 3680.96
yeah well so does beer and so does

3679.119 --> 3683.96
a joint

3680.96 --> 3683.96
so

3685.119 --> 3688.6400000000003
if you use it right

3686.72 --> 3692.0789999999997
and you limit the amount

3688.64 --> 3693.839
and you choose a time in the day

3692.079 --> 3695.6800000000003
or

3693.839 --> 3699.4
in a weekend or whatever you have a

3695.68 --> 3699.3999999999996
moment for it

3701.28 --> 3707.52
i'm not against it at base

3704.88 --> 3709.44
don't put words in my mouth i'm saying

3707.52 --> 3710.96
it shouldn't be

3709.44 --> 3713.68
normal lies

3710.96 --> 3715.92
it shouldn't be turned into oh look it's

3713.68 --> 3718.0
just a party drug just like alco or

3715.92 --> 3721.76
whatever right

3718.0 --> 3721.76
yeah that's what i'm talking about

3724.88 --> 3728.4
right

3726.4 --> 3732.559
it should my opinion people shouldn't

3728.4 --> 3734.88
even widely know that about it right

3732.559 --> 3734.88
i mean

3735.839 --> 3741.44
if you want an alternative to

3738.319 --> 3743.68
pharmaceutical anti-depression drugs

3741.44 --> 3746.0
then yeah maybe an herbalist will tell

3743.68 --> 3748.24
you hey maybe try these mushrooms this

3746.0 --> 3751.599
is how you do it right well then it

3748.24 --> 3753.839
would be like a cure for something

3751.599 --> 3755.839
it would not be like oh a party drug

3753.839 --> 3758.24
everybody knows it exists it's out there

3755.839 --> 3760.96
you could just buy it in the store

3758.24 --> 3760.9599999999996
just like that

3761.92 --> 3767.2000000000003
because then people are good teens and

3764.64 --> 3770.48
[ __ ] kids are gonna catch on to it and

3767.2 --> 3772.96
they are going to abuse it they will do

3770.48 --> 3775.039
it they will do it

3772.96 --> 3776.48
and it will not be stopped because it's

3775.039 --> 3778.88
too easy

3776.48 --> 3779.92
they're basically punishing everybody

3778.88 --> 3783.44
else

3779.92 --> 3785.76
for allowing society to make them wreck

3783.44 --> 3788.0
themselves that easily

3785.76 --> 3792.7990000000004
that's what's gonna happen don't

3788.0 --> 3792.799
normalize it it's not normal

3793.599 --> 3798.319
it should

3795.359 --> 3799.2799999999997
considerably be kept somewhat of a

3798.319 --> 3803.4
secret

3799.28 --> 3803.4
that is even out there

3815.57 --> 3818.719
[Music]

3836.48 --> 3840.72
yeah i know it's not literally well

3838.64 --> 3842.799
people do actually use it like that

3840.72 --> 3845.1189999999997
though at face

3842.799 --> 3847.359
that some people do actually use it like

3845.119 --> 3847.359
that

3848.319 --> 3854.319
i've known people that have used it like

3852.0 --> 3854.319
that

3855.92 --> 3859.799
by their own stories

3876.559 --> 3880.079
but you're constantly bringing it up

3878.4 --> 3882.48
though and you're like oh look this can

3880.079 --> 3885.2000000000003
do that can do oh look at all it

3882.48 --> 3889.52
yeah it's already

3885.2 --> 3891.2
right now in the world in the west right

3889.52 --> 3894.559
now

3891.2 --> 3896.5589999999997
it's happening don't you get it it is

3894.559 --> 3898.88
being normalized

3896.559 --> 3902.2400000000002
right now

3898.88 --> 3903.119
by people like joe rogan

3902.24 --> 3908.1189999999997
right

3903.119 --> 3908.119
that's normalization that's terrible

3908.48 --> 3914.52
people are gonna [ __ ] themselves up

3910.88 --> 3914.52
because of it

3924.4 --> 3931.7200000000003
what are you talking about kai from gore

3927.599 --> 3931.7200000000003
had i ever had to do what

3941.52 --> 3946.079
but for some reason think alco should be

3943.76 --> 3948.079
legal yeah because of what happens when

3946.079 --> 3950.4
you make it illegal

3948.079 --> 3952.6400000000003
look i'm not saying

3950.4 --> 3952.64
like

3954.079 --> 3959.2000000000003
god damn it

3956.319 --> 3959.2
let me explain this

3959.839 --> 3963.799
it's a different category

3968.88 --> 3973.839
so yeah that's what i'm saying

3972.079 --> 3975.92
that's exactly what i'm saying not

3973.839 --> 3977.599
saying that alcohol should be

3975.92 --> 3980.64
like encouraged

3977.599 --> 3983.599
and advertised for everywhere constantly

3980.64 --> 3983.5989999999997
i'm against that

3984.48 --> 3986.72
right

3987.76 --> 3994.96
but yeah you should definitely not have

3991.599 --> 3997.44
like um hyalurogenic mushrooms

3994.96 --> 3999.039
in a vending machine in every [ __ ]

3997.44 --> 4001.839
restaurant okay

3999.039 --> 4003.8390000000004
that's what i think you shouldn't have

4001.839 --> 4006.24
right now if you want to have certain

4003.839 --> 4007.2799999999997
types of beers available in restaurants

4006.24 --> 4009.52
yeah

4007.28 --> 4010.48
yeah i get that

4009.52 --> 4013.2
that

4010.48 --> 4016.0
i don't see the problem

4013.2 --> 4018.0
mushroom hallucinogenic mushroom vending

4016.0 --> 4020.64
machines

4018.0 --> 4024.2
at party places and restaurants

4020.64 --> 4024.2
no thank you

4033.52 --> 4038.6
[Music]

4035.45 --> 4038.6
[Applause]

4040.559 --> 4045.96
and we don't care a kumu virus we don't

4042.64 --> 4045.96
want to know

4049.119 --> 4053.7200000000003
this is not the place for that

4082.559 --> 4089.28
yeah well metal slugs cockatiel sure

4086.24 --> 4090.3999999999996
right hey i'm i don't mind anything as

4089.28 --> 4092.6400000000003
long as you

4090.4 --> 4094.799
take it responsibly the problem is if

4092.64 --> 4097.12
you normalize things

4094.799 --> 4099.5199999999995
and you start advertising and everybody

4097.12 --> 4101.199
talks about it and oh look now the kids

4099.52 --> 4104.719
are talking about oh they're probably

4101.199 --> 4107.199
doing it too then huh huh yeah

4104.719 --> 4111.719
that's normalization that's what you

4107.199 --> 4111.719
don't want with it

4121.12 --> 4125.839
you don't think anybody would want that

4124.0 --> 4129.12
well

4125.839 --> 4131.12
what if it was fully legalized and there

4129.12 --> 4133.759
would be companies like

4131.12 --> 4136.48
yeah we're just gonna make everybody

4133.759 --> 4140.0
addicted to this [ __ ] and just like

4136.48 --> 4142.239
coca-cola right put the vending machines

4140.0 --> 4143.759
everywhere because it's legal and

4142.239 --> 4146.5599999999995
they're just gonna do it because they

4143.759 --> 4149.04
don't give a [ __ ] if people even want it

4146.56 --> 4151.679
they're going to normalize it because

4149.04 --> 4153.759
it's legal and they're gonna make you

4151.679 --> 4157.1990000000005
addicted because it's legal they can

4153.759 --> 4160.679
just do it then yeah that's what happens

4157.199 --> 4160.678999999999
that's what happens

4161.6 --> 4165.120000000001
so no you don't think anybody would want

4164.239 --> 4168.159
that

4165.12 --> 4168.159
oh yes sure

4168.64 --> 4173.04
there's a lot of those types of things

4171.12 --> 4175.679
throughout history

4173.04 --> 4178.08
a lot of them where people thought

4175.679 --> 4180.88
nobody would just want that

4178.08 --> 4184.0
to be normal oh guess what happened 100

4180.88 --> 4186.400000000001
years later oh it's normal yeah

4184.0 --> 4188.96
who would want coffee

4186.4 --> 4191.44
like coffee is not that great like

4188.96 --> 4193.199
nobody just wants coffee all the time oh

4191.44 --> 4194.159
guess what

4193.199 --> 4196.4
oh

4194.159 --> 4198.08
there's coffee trade oh look we got

4196.4 --> 4201.839999999999
coffee everywhere oh now everybody

4198.08 --> 4204.4
drinks coffee yeah oh you didn't think

4201.84 --> 4205.52
that anybody would want it

4204.4 --> 4208.799999999999
well

4205.52 --> 4210.2390000000005
people change over time and what you

4208.8 --> 4212.96
think

4210.239 --> 4215.5199999999995
doesn't last

4212.96 --> 4218.719
because they will want it because they

4215.52 --> 4220.719
will be made to want it

4218.719 --> 4224.08
especially the youth is highly

4220.719 --> 4225.52
suggestible and if you legalize stuff

4224.08 --> 4229.04
that means

4225.52 --> 4231.84
corporations can decide to normalize it

4229.04 --> 4234.8
to make a market for themselves so it

4231.84 --> 4234.8
will happen then

4241.84 --> 4246.4800000000005
jesus said faced what the [ __ ] are you

4243.84 --> 4246.4800000000005
talking about

4253.44 --> 4257.678999999999
you're not listened this is not a

4255.76 --> 4261.0
response to what you were talking about

4257.679 --> 4261.0
at face

4262.7 --> 4265.739
[Music]

4276.96 --> 4282.32
this is not real yeah you said nobody

4279.76 --> 4284.96
wants much rooms in the vending machine

4282.32 --> 4288.0
yeah well not right now

4284.96 --> 4289.04
if you legalize it

4288.0 --> 4291.76
then

4289.04 --> 4293.36
you'll end up with people that will be

4291.76 --> 4295.360000000001
like oh yeah there's the vending machine

4293.36 --> 4299.04
right just like oh thank god they have

4295.36 --> 4300.88
vending machines for cigarettes yeah

4299.04 --> 4302.96
well

4300.88 --> 4304.8
how did that come into being

4302.96 --> 4306.8
right

4304.8 --> 4309.1990000000005
well first you legalize then you

4306.8 --> 4313.159000000001
normalize then you advertise and now

4309.199 --> 4313.159
everybody wants it

4323.52 --> 4328.6
are you talking about

4325.28 --> 4328.599999999999

which we

4486.0 --> 4490.48
do

4487.36 --> 4492.639999999999
it's not always the same at face it

4490.48 --> 4497.48
changes constantly

4492.64 --> 4497.4800000000005
but i seek out indica strains

4516.239 --> 4522.32
what metal slugs coca-cola really you

4519.199 --> 4524.08
think that's gonna prevent

4522.32 --> 4528.48
it from getting in the hands of the

4524.08 --> 4528.48
youth dude what world are you living in

4529.36 --> 4536.88
no it doesn't that's the thing youths

4533.36 --> 4540.159
always figure a way out

4536.88 --> 4542.56
did break that system and just do what

4540.159 --> 4544.32
they're not supposed to do they always

4542.56 --> 4546.88
do

4544.32 --> 4548.96
they always do they always figure out a

4546.88 --> 4550.96
way

4548.96 --> 4553.12
to deal like

4550.96 --> 4555.28
like falsify

4553.12 --> 4557.44
passes and [ __ ] and like get all

4555.28 --> 4558.8
electronic sometimes even if they need

4557.44 --> 4560.239
to

4558.8 --> 4562.56
they'll do it

4560.239 --> 4566.44
they can they're the young

4562.56 --> 4566.4400000000005
they will do that

4570.48 --> 4573.919999999999
no kai from gore

4580.08 --> 4584.64
shepherd

4581.44 --> 4584.639999999999
no no we haven't

4584.88 --> 4589.04
i mean we had a bit of a brush fire at

4587.04 --> 4592.56
my old house one time

4589.04 --> 4594.88
but yeah we just got the hose and

4592.56 --> 4598.0
extinguished it

4594.88 --> 4599.36
it's not that difficult

4598.0 --> 4603.8
just need

4599.36 --> 4603.799999999999
running water and a hose

4606.28 --> 4609.34
[Music]

4619.44 --> 4624.639999999999
added sugars and caffeine at the same

4622.159 --> 4624.639999999999
effect

4626.32 --> 4630.48
okay

4627.6 --> 4633.679
that's weird at first i didn't know that

4630.48 --> 4638.159
specifically but yeah sativa i

4633.679 --> 4638.159
i don't like it it's not great for me

4640.96 --> 4644.2390000000005
weird that it would have like

4642.239 --> 4646.718999999999
caffeine-like effects

4644.239 --> 4648.799999999999
makes sense i don't take sugar anymore i

4646.719 --> 4650.719
don't have caffeine anymore i don't

4648.8 --> 4653.1990000000005
drink coffee anymore

4650.719 --> 4655.36
they did have a bit of sativa

4653.199 --> 4657.919999999999
like last week

4655.36 --> 4659.36
just to try it out again and it

4657.92 --> 4662.159
it was weird

4659.36 --> 4662.159
so different

4662.56 --> 4667.84
but i don't like it it's not good for me

4665.199 --> 4667.839999999999
on average

4676.0 --> 4681.12
makes you dumb all right metals look

4678.8 --> 4685.6
well that's the that's the effect that

4681.12 --> 4685.599999999999
happens if you don't smoke it regularly

4685.92 --> 4690.56
then you get the knock on the head and

4688.0 --> 4694.32
super glitter you become like a slow

4690.56 --> 4697.6
right yeah well if you smoke

4694.32 --> 4699.92
like i have more than half your life

4697.6 --> 4702.400000000001
that goes away it doesn't make you dumb

4699.92 --> 4702.4
anymore

4703.04 --> 4708.719
it actually makes you more resilient

4706.0 --> 4710.56
well maybe that's just because i

4708.719 --> 4711.44
just kept doing what i did right through

4710.56 --> 4714.88
it

4711.44 --> 4717.678999999999
i learned to think with cannabis

4714.88 --> 4719.6
right but yeah when i was younger

4717.679 --> 4722.4800000000005
and i would like take a hit of a joint

4719.6 --> 4722.4800000000005
yeah i would be like

4724.719 --> 4732.12
yeah i would be kind of [ __ ] too and

4727.44 --> 4732.12
lazy especially freaking lazy

4737.44 --> 4740.719
but also i'd get like incredibly

4739.44 --> 4742.48
creative

4740.719 --> 4745.28
with drawings and

4742.48 --> 4748.44
designing and all that

4745.28 --> 4748.44
i mean

4751.12 --> 4756.48
to be fair i have been more creative

4753.36 --> 4759.88
when i wasn't smoking

4756.48 --> 4759.879999999999
it is true

4775.44 --> 4780.719
okay dispensaries

4778.719 --> 4783.12
okay but yeah matters look but that's

4780.719 --> 4785.04
like with that's with operators that's

4783.12 --> 4786.48
with people that's basically a store

4785.04 --> 4789.6
right

4786.48 --> 4791.678999999999
that's not a machine ven it's not a

4789.6 --> 4793.4400000000005
vending machine

4791.679 --> 4796.56
right where you'd like oh you need an

4793.44 --> 4797.599999999999
identity card or something specific to

4796.56 --> 4799.6
get it

4797.6 --> 4801.92
well if it's that simple

4799.6 --> 4804.8
then literally kids can just like steal

4801.92 --> 4808.8
a pass or crack it figure out how to

4804.8 --> 4808.8
falsify it and then just get it

4808.88 --> 4812.96
right

4809.92 --> 4814.719
but yeah if there is like people in

4812.96 --> 4817.28
stores

4814.719 --> 4819.76
like in those dispensaries yeah then the

4817.28 --> 4821.599999999999
youths aren't gonna get it unless they

4819.76 --> 4823.360000000001
basically

4821.6 --> 4826.159000000001
like

4823.36 --> 4828.32
yeah leech it of somebody else

4826.159 --> 4830.0
that gets it for them right that's still

4828.32 --> 4831.599999999999
gonna happen by the way

4830.0 --> 4834.4
don't forget about that part that's

4831.6 --> 4834.400000000001
still gonna happen

4844.96 --> 4847.84
that's right

4850.88 --> 4856.88
can't totally prevent it but the more

4853.6 --> 4859.4400000000005
it's normalized and industrialized

4856.88 --> 4862.2390000000005
the bigger the risk that's the formula

4859.44 --> 4865.04
it is how it works

4862.239 --> 4868.638999999999
the more it becomes normal the easier it

4865.04 --> 4868.639
will become for the youths

4869.28 --> 4873.599999999999
because it's like it's in their face

4871.199 --> 4875.919999999999
it's like their challenge like uh

4873.6 --> 4878.4800000000005
there's this stuff everywhere

4875.92 --> 4879.76
i'm not supposed to get it well guess

4878.48 --> 4881.919999999999
what

4879.76 --> 4884.08
they're gonna get it now if it wasn't

4881.92 --> 4887.04
everywhere staring them in the face like

4884.08 --> 4889.28
for adults only then they might not ever

4887.04 --> 4890.88
even catch on that it was there

4889.28 --> 4892.719
and then want to get it because they're

4890.88 --> 4893.6
not supposed to

4892.719 --> 4895.84
right

4893.6 --> 4897.76
that's the difference if it is like a

4895.84 --> 4899.12
rare thing and it's only like in this

4897.76 --> 4902.2390000000005
one store

4899.12 --> 4904.32
and it's kind of kept hush yeah kids are

4902.239 --> 4905.919999999999
not really gonna catch on or maybe they

4904.32 --> 4907.5199999999995
will and then

4905.92 --> 4909.84
they'll just forget about it again after

4907.52 --> 4912.639
they aren't allowed to try it

4909.84 --> 4914.719
right but if it is normal and it's like

4912.639 --> 4917.92
everywhere

4914.719 --> 4919.92
then it's gonna stare them in the face

4917.92 --> 4921.92
that's the effect

4919.92 --> 4924.08
they're gonna want to do it because

4921.92 --> 4926.08
they're not supposed to

4924.08 --> 4929.719
they just will

4926.08 --> 4929.719
some of them anyway

4932.51 --> 4935.85
[Music]

4940.88 --> 4944.4800000000005
internet kids

4942.48 --> 4947.04
who grew up with booze normalized or

4944.48 --> 4948.638999999999
less likely to abuse it when older

4947.04 --> 4951.44
that's

4948.639 --> 4951.4400000000005
based on what

4956.8 --> 4963.1990000000005
i mean i've memories from like i guess

4960.239 --> 4966.08
20th century spain

4963.199 --> 4968.638999999999
where they where like drinking wine red

4966.08 --> 4970.88
wine was like really normal at in the

4968.639 --> 4973.36
region where i was anyway

4970.88 --> 4976.159000000001
and yeah

4973.36 --> 4977.12
it was very normal

4976.159 --> 4981.04
right

4977.12 --> 4983.5199999999995
less likely to abuse my older well

4981.04 --> 4985.6
there were quite a few

4983.52 --> 4988.0
older people

4985.6 --> 4990.2390000000005
that were just like

4988.0 --> 4993.52
you could just spot them that were

4990.239 --> 4995.599999999999
obviously alcoholics in spain

4993.52 --> 4999.280000000001
i don't know if they're still all there

4995.6 --> 5001.76
it was like was it what do you know

4999.28 --> 5003.04
30 years ago

5001.76 --> 5006.719
right

5003.04 --> 5008.8
so no no normalization doesn't decrease

5006.719 --> 5011.44
the amount of people that are going to

5008.8 --> 5014.4400000000005
end up drug addicts of it

5011.44 --> 5014.44
actually

5019.199 --> 5023.599999999999
i doubt the slope is so slippery that

5021.28 --> 5025.44
it'll ever happen

5023.6 --> 5027.120000000001
oh really

5025.44 --> 5031.199
you doubt it do you

5027.12 --> 5033.599999999999
yes yes of course i mean this is not

5031.199 --> 5034.5599999999995
just the age where everything that's

5033.6 --> 5036.8
just

5034.56 --> 5039.280000000001
insane is suddenly

5036.8 --> 5043.76
being put up for agenda of normalization

5039.28 --> 5047.759999999999
or anything so you really can't imagine

5043.76 --> 5049.360000000001
that they would just do that anyway

5047.76 --> 5051.280000000001
now you really have a lack of

5049.36 --> 5052.799999999999
imagination then because i think that

5051.28 --> 5055.12
with everything that's going on in the

5052.8 --> 5057.28
world right now i think that they

5055.12 --> 5060.88
i think almost they they do something

5057.28 --> 5065.12
like jet just to [ __ ] with you

5060.88 --> 5066.08
just to do it on purpose

5065.12 --> 5069.8
like

5066.08 --> 5069.8
to confuse you

5084.0 --> 5087.34
getting hold of booze as an underage kid

5086.0 --> 5088.96
makes it cooler

5087.34 --> 5092.76
[Music]

5088.96 --> 5092.76
well not for long

5100.239 --> 5105.759999999999
it may for a while but yeah it's very

5102.96 --> 5107.92
hard to hide alcohol use

5105.76 --> 5111.719
for kids

5107.92 --> 5111.719
they're gonna get in trouble

5114.719 --> 5120.56
right and if you normalize it well then

5117.36 --> 5122.32
they might just end up

5120.56 --> 5124.639
just like parents not really paying

5122.32 --> 5126.5599999999995
attention and then they taking a sip

5124.639 --> 5130.32
every now and then and then they're like

5126.56 --> 5130.320000000001
really young alcoholics

5131.76 --> 5135.52
so

5133.36 --> 5135.5199999999995
no

5137.84 --> 5140.56
right

5138.719 --> 5142.4
the problem with alcohol is that if you

5140.56 --> 5145.120000000001
take it enough especially when you're

5142.4 --> 5147.12
young you are much more likely to become

5145.12 --> 5149.36
an alcoholic

5147.12 --> 5152.159
because your system was still when

5149.36 --> 5156.08
growing is start to play in on its

5152.159 --> 5158.239
presence coming into you

5156.08 --> 5158.239
so

5159.44 --> 5164.5599999999995
yeah normalizing alcohol

5161.52 --> 5165.51
is not good either

5164.56 --> 5167.76
for youths

5165.51 --> 5170.96
[Music]

5167.76 --> 5172.88
it really should be like a 16 and 18

5170.96 --> 5175.8
plus drink

5172.88 --> 5178.93
i'm very happy it is in my country

5175.8 --> 5178.93
[Music]

5189.6 --> 5194.4800000000005
god

5191.44 --> 5196.638999999999
yes this is the freaking drugs episode

5194.48 --> 5199.12
where we talk about normalization of

5196.639 --> 5199.12
drugs

5200.48 --> 5204.839999999999
oh well

5201.679 --> 5204.84
why not

5216.71 --> 5219.81
[Music]

5229.44 --> 5234.5599999999995
all right so i got an

5231.12 --> 5234.5599999999995
entitled for the show today

5234.96 --> 5240.4
these types of talks are cool well cool

5237.92 --> 5242.719
i hope i'm being informative because i

5240.4 --> 5244.4
am really trying to basically discourage

5242.719 --> 5246.8
people

5244.4 --> 5246.799999999999
it's like

5247.6 --> 5253.280000000001
like making it hardcore illegal has

5250.4 --> 5257.44
problems it'll create criminality

5253.28 --> 5259.199
but legalization also has its problems

5257.44 --> 5261.678999999999
especially

5259.199 --> 5264.96
if it's like greenlighted to be

5261.679 --> 5268.719
exploited by corporations

5264.96 --> 5272.159
so both are a risk

5268.719 --> 5275.4
i'm trying to create awareness

5272.159 --> 5275.4
right now

5304.96 --> 5309.84
that's right and you will know s indeed

5318.159 --> 5323.04
corporations aren't the problem excuse

5321.04 --> 5326.32
me that phrase

5323.04 --> 5326.32
yeah yeah they are

5327.76 --> 5331.52
yeah of course politicians make the

5329.36 --> 5333.839999999999
rules but that that's the point a

5331.52 --> 5337.280000000001
corporation is not gonna

5333.84 --> 5339.28
exploit something if it's illegal

5337.28 --> 5340.32
right so yeah the

5339.28 --> 5342.48
government

5340.32 --> 5345.92
politicians if you will have to set the

5342.48 --> 5349.199
rules but if they just green light

5345.92 --> 5350.88
a drug for full normalization

5349.199 --> 5353.759999999999
that's when the corporations are

5350.88 --> 5356.88
basically going to create addicts

5353.76 --> 5356.88
that's what they will do

5358.0 --> 5363.36
especially like really

5360.4 --> 5366.159
globalist mentality type corporations

5363.36 --> 5366.159
that's what they'll do

5367.52 --> 5371.84
it is the problem

5369.92 --> 5374.4800000000005
that it will be in the corporation and

5371.84 --> 5376.2390000000005
of course the politics will

5374.48 --> 5378.159
set the president it will make it

5376.239 --> 5380.718999999999
possible for the corporations to start

5378.159 --> 5380.719
doing that

5382.08 --> 5389.4
corporations own the politicians

5385.679 --> 5389.4
some of them yeah

5395.679 --> 5399.639
hello seeking star wars

5411.04 --> 5415.04
all cultures partaking it except the

5413.12 --> 5417.5199999999995
cultures that don't partake in it and

5415.04 --> 5421.84
make it illegal

5417.52 --> 5421.84
like certain islamic countries

5426.48 --> 5430.48
now where is alcohol normalized for kids

5428.96 --> 5432.56
yes

5430.48 --> 5434.718999999999
i'm not talking about specifically

5432.56 --> 5437.92
normalizing for kids that is that would

5434.719 --> 5441.36
be like pretty dramatic but if it's just

5437.92 --> 5444.08
really normalized for the adults even

5441.36 --> 5446.48
and they are not super strict about it

5444.08 --> 5449.12
toward their kids

5446.48 --> 5451.919999999999
then kids will still

5449.12 --> 5455.12
especially with alcohol

5451.92 --> 5457.4400000000005
tend to on average turn into alcoholics

5455.12 --> 5457.44
more

5458.32 --> 5460.88
right

5459.12 --> 5462.5599999999995
so

5460.88 --> 5465.04
all cultures

5462.56 --> 5468.0
it has been around for a long time it is

5465.04 --> 5469.36
well it is culturally normalized

5468.0 --> 5471.28
by certain

5469.36 --> 5472.799999999999
people and that's their own prerogative

5471.28 --> 5474.239
it's their choice of doing that but

5472.8 --> 5475.679
they're going to also pay a price for

5474.239 --> 5477.28
that

5475.679 --> 5480.88
within it like they have to take the

5477.28 --> 5483.36
responsibility that comes with that

5480.88 --> 5486.96
and if they do that right then yeah they

5483.36 --> 5489.599999999999
can still protect their youths

5486.96 --> 5489.6
from it

5489.76 --> 5492.76
anyway

5516.84 --> 5520.96
yeah yes you can start water

5521.92 --> 5527.36
romanticize drug culture or they at

5525.12 --> 5529.12
least they normalize it and then just

5527.36 --> 5532.96
make you

5529.12 --> 5535.44
feel like epic and all that for

5532.96 --> 5538.56
being the drug pimp

5535.44 --> 5538.5599999999995
for being the dealer

5539.6 --> 5544.8
right they romanticize

5542.159 --> 5547.5199999999995
drug dealing criminality and they have

5544.8 --> 5550.88
for quite a while

5547.52 --> 5550.88
quite a while

5559.52 --> 5564.400000000001
but i don't know romanticized drug

5561.679 --> 5566.0
culture like the actual drug use i don't

5564.4 --> 5568.96
know about that if it's really

5566.0 --> 5571.96
romanticized it

5568.96 --> 5571.96
but

5578.0 --> 5581.0
yep

5600.159 --> 5604.0
yeah that's right i'm a cool mover

5601.84 --> 5605.92
that's what i thought

5604.0 --> 5606.88
the vacuum of a dream is straight out

5605.92 --> 5609.76
about

5606.88 --> 5612.32
just hard drug use and all that

5609.76 --> 5615.12
but it was a pretty

5612.32 --> 5617.36
dramatic message

5615.12 --> 5620.84
it's not romanticization i'd say it was

5617.36 --> 5620.839999999999
more of a confrontation

5658.08 --> 5661.84
anyhow i think i'm gonna round out the

5659.76 --> 5664.4800000000005
show

5661.84 --> 5664.4800000000005
i can't believe

5664.639 --> 5668.88
i talked about

5666.719 --> 5669.679
drugs for that freaking long with you

5668.88 --> 5673.84
guys

5669.679 --> 5673.84
i guess you had it on your mind

5682.08 --> 5686.36
and you guys brought it up

5689.44 --> 5694.239
okay you're making a case cool write a

5691.92 --> 5696.4800000000005
report about it

5694.239 --> 5699.48
that's really cool mecca metal slugs

5696.48 --> 5699.48
cockatiel

5700.32 --> 5705.599999999999
i'm saying your imagination

5703.28 --> 5708.639
is quite limited

5705.6 --> 5711.360000000001
i think you uh underestimate how far

5708.639 --> 5715.159000000001
things can maneuver outside of

5711.36 --> 5715.159
our comfort zones

5721.44 --> 5725.009999999999
all right yeah you're right yeah some

5723.92 --> 5727.679
directors do

5725.01 --> 5729.4400000000005
[Music]

5727.679 --> 5732.159
romance says drug culture like quentin

5729.44 --> 5736.159
taratino yeah and that's like the one

5732.159 --> 5736.159
thing that sucks about him

5741.199 --> 5743.839999999999
right

5745.52 --> 5750.159000000001
but even like is that really

5747.96 --> 5752.4
romanticization though or is it more

5750.159 --> 5752.4
like

5754.32 --> 5759.28
just being a little bit liberal about it

5757.199 --> 5761.199
because i mean

5759.28 --> 5763.44
he's not like oh take the drugs now

5761.199 --> 5766.32
you're invincible it's not like creating

5763.44 --> 5768.96
some nonsense myth about it

5766.32 --> 5768.96
or anything

5769.36 --> 5773.679
it's just that he he's like

5770.96 --> 5775.84
normalization just talking about it what

5773.679 --> 5778.719
would you say about it how can still be

5775.84 --> 5781.119000000001
a badass in the face of it etc etc etc

5778.719 --> 5784.08
that sort of [ __ ] right but i mean drug

5781.119 --> 5786.799999999999
users in this movie still tend to like

5784.08 --> 5790.239
end up [ __ ] and all that right so it's

5786.8 --> 5792.719
still not a complete romanticization

5790.239 --> 5796.36
but he does really like to bring it up a

5792.719 --> 5796.36
lot doesn't he

5798.0 --> 5802.159
we have any kid alcohol problems in

5800.239 --> 5803.44
nails it's funny that you asked that

5802.159 --> 5805.839999999999
that place

5803.44 --> 5808.879999999999
yeah yeah we did i don't know how it's

5805.84 --> 5811.84
right now but i still remember

5808.88 --> 5813.36
yeah in the late 90s

5811.84 --> 5815.6
yeah

5813.36 --> 5817.04
do you remember you might have been too

5815.6 --> 5820.4800000000005
young

5817.04 --> 5821.199
but yeah kids chugging alcohol do you

5820.48 --> 5824.48
know

5821.199 --> 5827.839999999999
there's a similar problem in england

5824.48 --> 5830.0
kids chugging alcohol

5827.84 --> 5831.84
like oh i'm 18. i can drink and then

5830.0 --> 5832.88
they like almost drank themselves to

5831.84 --> 5834.4800000000005
death

5832.88 --> 5837.76
on hard liquor

5834.48 --> 5838.799999999999
yeah yeah we do actually have a bit of a

5837.76 --> 5841.679
problem

5838.8 --> 5842.96
around that issue at face

5841.679 --> 5844.639
yes we did

5842.96 --> 5846.8
i don't know if it's still there there

5844.639 --> 5849.119
but i know it was there

5846.8 --> 5851.52
been freaking dutch documentaries about

5849.119 --> 5855.839999999999
it and all

5851.52 --> 5855.84
i actually paid attention to those

5858.639 --> 5866.119
oh please metal slugs cockatiel

5863.119 --> 5866.119
please

5872.32 --> 5877.759999999999
we'll we'll talk

5874.0 --> 5877.76
we'll talk in another 10 years

5878.239 --> 5884.32
yeah dude i've barely lifted the veil on

5881.52 --> 5886.8
how [ __ ] insane things are probably

5884.32 --> 5886.799999999999
gonna get

5888.639 --> 5892.96
i mean we know what is being planned for

5891.52 --> 5895.360000000001
us

5892.96 --> 5896.88
you don't know yet how humanity is

5895.36 --> 5899.04
actually gonna respond to that

5896.88 --> 5901.04
especially the ones that are

5899.04 --> 5904.4
allegedly lost

5901.04 --> 5906.639
dude you think humanity can go crazy and

5904.4 --> 5909.599999999999
that we've seen the worst of it you

5906.639 --> 5912.8
ain't seen nothing yet

5909.6 --> 5916.2390000000005
so yeah your grip on reality might not

5912.8 --> 5916.2390000000005
be as strong as you think

5916.8 --> 5918.8
as in

5918.0 --> 5921.92
you're

5918.8 --> 5924.2390000000005
probably not as good as estimating how

5921.92 --> 5926.96
things develop on the long run as you

5924.239 --> 5926.959999999999
think you are

5928.719 --> 5932.2390000000005
i happen to have a very good grip on

5931.36 --> 5935.5199999999995
that

5932.239 --> 5938.718999999999
and i tested it all my life

5935.52 --> 5942.159000000001
very specifically why because i wanted

5938.719 --> 5943.04
to be that guy that would be right every

5942.159 --> 5945.04
time

5943.04 --> 5948.48
i want to be right even if i don't

5945.04 --> 5953.0
understand it i still want to be right

5948.48 --> 5953.0
and build a system for that

5953.6 --> 5955.84
so

5954.48 --> 5957.599999999999
you're saying oh

5955.84 --> 5961.1990000000005
