quite beautiful like yesterday yesterday

71.74 --> 88.47
was incredible it's nice and warm it's

82.06 --> 90.729
not too windy it's just really nice day

88.47 --> 95.02
and so was yesterday

90.729 --> 97.6
although the evening was really cold was

95.02 --> 100.24
a clear sky and we are when I had to go

97.6 --> 102.54899999999999
back somehow the connections didn't

100.24 --> 108.08999999999999
really work out all too well and I spent

102.549 --> 110.97900000000001
up over I'm so glad I survived like Oh

108.09 --> 114.7
standing or sitting over one and a half

110.979 --> 117.97
hour in total outside in stations and

114.7 --> 121.39
whatever waiting on things Oh especially

117.97 --> 123.31
at one point like 40 minutes straight oh

121.39 --> 128.17
my god I literally just tried to

123.31 --> 131.829
hypnotize myself into sleep and or

128.17 --> 134.92
rather just like focus on a DND thing

131.829 --> 138.70000000000002
dream or something whatever and it

134.92 --> 142.57
worked but man I hate waiting when

138.7 --> 144.48899999999998
there's really nothing else to do yeah I

142.57 --> 149.04
got to wear a coffee with me today and

144.489 --> 149.04
tea by the way that's it

151.03 --> 158.99
yeah yesterday was an absolute blast it

154.28 --> 161.33
was amazing what's I almost feel bit

158.99 --> 164.9
embarrassed because it was just such a

161.33 --> 166.73000000000002
great day and I was kind of going there

164.9 --> 169.01000000000002
with the attitude like yeah I'm gonna do

166.73 --> 172.88
all kinds of housework and stuff she'll

169.01 --> 176.53
need and well we just had so much fun

172.88 --> 181.28
and we had a really prolonged dinner and

176.53 --> 183.8
and it seemed like she needed that just

181.28 --> 185.84
the most she just needed some good time

183.8 --> 189.5
with somebody who really knows her and

185.84 --> 192.86
understands her and man that kid she's

189.5 --> 197.06
so amazing and yeah she that that kid of

192.86 --> 200.3
hers really likes me a lot and she lets

197.06 --> 203.48
me do things that she even doesn't let

200.3 --> 206.03
her daddy do that's so weird like she

203.48 --> 209.07999999999998
asked me literally her mom if I could

206.03 --> 216.62
feed her at some point that was just

209.08 --> 221.709
yeah it gets me a little emotional and

216.62 --> 221.709
that and just

224.18 --> 233.329
oh I really needed that too and it's

229.73 --> 235.659
just glorious and my only regret is that

233.329 --> 238.459
she's not mine

235.659 --> 243.319
that she's not my kid and he was so

238.459 --> 245.709
weird like even a neighboring kid it was

243.319 --> 248.17999999999998
a little older and they're kind of like

245.709 --> 251.0
sort of playing together she's little

248.18 --> 257.23900000000003
too young still but he's nice and he

251.0 --> 261.07
asked me like are you her dad yeah yeah

257.239 --> 263.9
it was almost like it was all so

261.07 --> 269.12
glorious and weird it almost felt like a

263.9 --> 275.53
movie it was really bizarre but it was

269.12 --> 278.3
good I still did some gardening work

275.53 --> 280.76
somewhere in-between after the kid went

278.3 --> 284.21000000000004
to bed but it got really dark and really

280.76 --> 287.36
cold and I couldn't see a lot so but

284.21 --> 292.62
yeah that's something at least and after

287.36 --> 296.19
that it was pretty much party time

292.62 --> 299.28000000000003
and it was funny because yes she just

296.19 --> 303.99
had a giant packet like I mean a giant

299.28 --> 308.01
package like a meter a cubic meter

303.99 --> 311.34000000000003
package big a big carton box that she

308.01 --> 314.46
ordered from a very specific company

311.34 --> 317.72999999999996
that relates to B so she got like wax

314.46 --> 320.21999999999997
candles and Mead and just pots a honey

317.73 --> 323.84000000000003
and all at like lots of things relating

320.22 --> 327.87
to honey and she basically broke a

323.84 --> 330.96
bottle of mead and I had 2/3 of it and

327.87 --> 333.0
she just like almost fed it to me like

330.96 --> 338.72999999999996
yeah please enjoy please please enjoy

333.0 --> 344.66
enjoy enjoy enjoy I had put the brake on

338.73 --> 347.91
it myself but it was it was great and

344.66 --> 350.88000000000005
yeah really in the entire day the only

347.91 --> 353.43
annoying part was waiting so long on the

350.88 --> 355.11
at the station on the way back but I

353.43 --> 357.51
didn't even get a call or anything I

355.11 --> 360.0
just have my t-shirt on and a sweater I

357.51 --> 362.31
did bring my sweater I couldn't bring

360.0 --> 365.46
room for my jacket and in the day it was

362.31 --> 366.44
very hot and I wasn't gonna go around in

365.46 --> 369.96
my jacket

366.44 --> 372.36
but it was still cold but despite that I

369.96 --> 375.09
managed to get through it successfully

372.36 --> 380.64
without now getting all sneezy and [ __ ]

375.09 --> 384.38
despite a lot of people around me in the

380.64 --> 384.38
Train all that

386.55 --> 390.85
yeah

387.79 --> 390.85
[Music]

398.87 --> 405.19
what no Trish please look Oh

406.69 --> 416.5
like seriously do you pay any attention

410.57 --> 420.26
I didn't just meet her I know her over

416.5 --> 423.74
over 12 e no 14 years

420.26 --> 427.84
and 11 years ago I even had a

423.74 --> 434.3
relationship kind of short with her so I

427.84 --> 435.46999999999997
she yeah yeah she is the longest friend

434.3 --> 443.66
I've ever had

435.47 --> 446.66
so yeah that is different I know that no

443.66 --> 452.09000000000003
I even knew her mother and her mother

446.66 --> 454.63000000000005
passed away like what is it four or five

452.09 --> 454.63
years ago

455.54 --> 463.70000000000005
so yeah I'm like kind of special to her

459.38 --> 466.34
because most guys she knows just have

463.7 --> 468.83
really serious issues for some reason

466.34 --> 471.89
she tends to attract really intelligent

468.83 --> 475.15999999999997
people but yeah most intelligent people

471.89 --> 478.46
out there that are kind of like up for

475.16 --> 484.01000000000005
grabs they have very strong issues and

478.46 --> 485.71999999999997
I'm guess one of the few people that has

484.01 --> 493.96999999999997
it just completely under control

485.72 --> 497.78000000000003
compared to many of her other friends I

493.97 --> 500.03000000000003
do make with my head yeah I actually did

497.78 --> 502.90999999999997
a bit well I gave her just a neck

500.03 --> 507.14
massage that's something nobody ever

502.91 --> 510.11
doesn't to her or her really but yeah I

507.14 --> 512.479
did do that and but not too extensive

510.11 --> 515.45
you know it was just mostly talking a

512.479 --> 518.5
lot like on the phone we talked for

515.45 --> 518.5
hours and hours and hours

522.2 --> 532.3290000000001
yeah go for it no look she knows how I

525.35 --> 537.2900000000001
feel and the thing is there is not a

532.329 --> 540.2299999999999
suitable setup or energy to just like go

537.29 --> 543.62
for it and say oh wanna get married and

540.23 --> 547.49
get children the bond is not right for

543.62 --> 552.11
that it's actually kind of different it

547.49 --> 555.769
feels much more like like we're so

552.11 --> 557.4490000000001
reliable for one another that it's

555.769 --> 560.9590000000001
almost more like a king and queen

557.449 --> 563.24
relationship rather than a lover based

560.959 --> 569.63
family kind of setup I got that idea

563.24 --> 575.389
like I don't know I don't know yet

569.63 --> 580.31
I I don't have a lot of sexual feelings

575.389 --> 582.74
towards her although in a sense what I

580.31 --> 584.8699999999999
kind of like she is quite attractive you

582.74 --> 587.51
know and especially if she if she puts

584.87 --> 592.94
effort in it and like she knows her way

587.51 --> 595.459
around her femininity but I don't have

592.94 --> 597.32
like that oh my god she's all she's a

595.459 --> 605.63
killer like that effects not really

597.32 --> 608.12
there for me and but everything else

605.63 --> 610.399
does like everything else is there

608.12 --> 612.529
pretty much like I have of just a lot of

610.399 --> 616.839
care for her as she makes me feel strong

612.529 --> 622.579
I want to protect her and her inner kid

616.839 --> 625.73
but at the same time like I don't know

622.579 --> 628.2199999999999
if she if it's gonna turn out that she's

625.73 --> 633.5
also gonna be like the mother of my

628.22 --> 637.22
child it it I can't explain it really

633.5 --> 640.01
it just doesn't work yet it's not the

637.22 --> 643.88
right conditions and I'm not gonna like

640.01 --> 647.77
change things around because she's

643.88 --> 650.54
finally recovering from a lot of misery

647.77 --> 652.37
so I'm not gonna try to manipulate her

650.54 --> 654.4699999999999
into some kind of position that she'll

652.37 --> 662.33
do that absolutely not that would be

654.47 --> 666.35
horrific and I don't know if it's meant

662.33 --> 669.5200000000001
to be you know I'd rather to be fair I'd

666.35 --> 675.38
rather with her just have a lifelong

669.52 --> 677.09
very strong friendship that's just

675.38 --> 680.24
always gonna work so there's always

677.09 --> 683.84
somebody that you can throw out the most

680.24 --> 687.41
crazy and most emotional things that go

683.84 --> 691.13
extremely deep that you just don't share

687.41 --> 693.77
with anyone else and that yeah I kind of

691.13 --> 700.25
almost do that a bit on my show

693.77 --> 707.3
sometimes but even that is kind of

700.25 --> 710.42
chiseled in some way and it's just with

707.3 --> 713.12
her I can just really put it down in in

710.42 --> 715.6999999999999
its well sometimes in its nightmarish

713.12 --> 719.71
fashion so it can be understood why it

715.7 --> 723.2900000000001
is a nightmare to me that kind of thing

719.71 --> 725.63
and she gets that and the funny thing is

723.29 --> 728.98
well she has her own issues that are

725.63 --> 731.42
just super pressing that just totally

728.98 --> 734.08
malformed her consciousness even

731.42 --> 736.67
sometimes from the pressure and she

734.08 --> 739.87
remembers that she has kind of like the

736.67 --> 742.37
same level of consciousness at her own

739.87 --> 744.53
she has her own project towards herself

742.37 --> 748.42
like I have a zit worried that in the

744.53 --> 753.67
same way and she's learning a lot

748.42 --> 757.51
and yeah she's also while using my

753.67 --> 760.4799999999999
guidance at that and I'm using hers or

757.51 --> 763.3199999999999
rather yeah I am using her she has her

760.48 --> 766.1800000000001
own great instincts in certain peak

763.32 --> 769.0600000000001
places where I really don't have it that

766.18 --> 773.0699999999999
much and I have other peak talents and

769.06 --> 773.0699999999999
we fill each other really well at that

774.09 --> 782.5600000000001
or how do you say that you know what I

776.95 --> 786.3100000000001
mean but really from a friendship

782.56 --> 789.75
position like one of those friends you'd

786.31 --> 793.66
like know like yeah we are the fallback

789.75 --> 797.26
friend like in in the worst of emotional

793.66 --> 800.4599999999999
circumstances that you know and you

797.26 --> 803.05
don't just go and try a relationship

800.46 --> 804.58
with something like that because what if

803.05 --> 808.3599999999999
you damage it what if you suddenly

804.58 --> 812.9200000000001
poison the trust well you know then it's

808.36 --> 815.5
ruined that that magical perfect

812.92 --> 818.28
connection chemistry suddenly gets rude

815.5 --> 820.15
I don't want to risk that really and

818.28 --> 822.91
neither does she

820.15 --> 826.03
because she does also still find me

822.91 --> 829.54
attractive she does let on on that and

826.03 --> 831.16
so do I very carefully but both of us

829.54 --> 833.68
kind of like know of each other like

831.16 --> 836.67
yeah yeah we do find each other really

833.68 --> 841.0
nice but we're just not ready for that

836.67 --> 843.9699999999999
and we don't know if we will be and it's

841.0 --> 848.68
not that important to us yet it's and a

843.97 --> 851.23
lot of it is unspoken yeah so yeah

848.68 --> 853.3599999999999
yesterday Saturday it was pretty intense

851.23 --> 856.21
no it's not negative at all why would

853.36 --> 858.39
you say that bandsaw bandit what the

856.21 --> 858.39
hell

863.28 --> 870.4399999999999
no it's actually great

866.95 --> 870.44
[Music]

872.62 --> 875.759
[Music]

876.44 --> 889.0400000000001
I have sexuality okay I have like my

883.97 --> 891.58
physical needs but it's more like a an

889.04 --> 895.3399999999999
earthly thing it's really my body that

891.58 --> 897.86
wants that from me as it were and I'm

895.34 --> 900.73
just like yeah that's really nice and

897.86 --> 903.5600000000001
the world's just so easy to give that

900.73 --> 912.65
but I know what will happen if I just

903.56 --> 913.8499999999999
let it do that and yeah I don't want to

912.65 --> 919.1
do that again

913.85 --> 921.95
it's just it it disrupts my sense of

919.1 --> 925.45
purpose I guess it's kind of similar

921.95 --> 928.6700000000001
story to how Owen Benjamin regards porn

925.45 --> 931.5200000000001
and I never had really had it that bad

928.67 --> 933.5899999999999
with porn you know never that that it

931.52 --> 935.87
had that much of an impact really in the

933.59 --> 937.88
long run because I'd feel it and just

935.87 --> 940.34
step away because I was disgusted I go

937.88 --> 943.07
don't go through that disgust never and

940.34 --> 947.99
that goes the same for in relationships

943.07 --> 950.9000000000001
so but if you're constantly focused on

947.99 --> 953.24
sex just for example by being just with

950.9 --> 956.8299999999999
this incredibly attractive girlfriend

953.24 --> 960.79
and what just once sex all the time then

956.83 --> 965.4200000000001
it'll become so one note one focus one

960.79 --> 968.4499999999999
one-trick pony type of setup that the

965.42 --> 971.18
whole complex purpose and grip on things

968.45 --> 973.5500000000001
just starts to fade away and it's kind

971.18 --> 975.3499999999999
of the same effect and that is also what

973.55 --> 977.9599999999999
happened with me and my ex-girlfriend it

975.35 --> 982.37
was just all too much really too too

977.96 --> 985.4300000000001
great in certain ways and it was very

982.37 --> 987.98
obvious also especially afterward that

985.43 --> 990.62
she was also doing that really to

987.98 --> 993.23
camouflage issues that she just didn't

990.62 --> 994.88
want the day of light to see because she

993.23 --> 997.629
didn't want to work on it because she

994.88 --> 1000.039
was really afraid

997.629 --> 1003.549
that's the deal with parental rejection

1000.039 --> 1007.149
also anyway that was my axe that's not

1003.549 --> 1008.679
the girl I went to this or this Saturday

1007.149 --> 1011.069
not a totally different person just

1008.679 --> 1011.069
saying

1012.959 --> 1017.549
anyway relations relations relations

1025.4 --> 1031.92
sex doesn't mean kids well with my

1030.06 --> 1033.24
ex-girlfriend that I live with my last

1031.92 --> 1036.9
real ex-girlfriend

1033.24 --> 1039.54
I did really want kids but she made it

1036.9 --> 1042.3300000000002
pretty obvious at the start already that

1039.54 --> 1046.11
she didn't want but yeah I was so in

1042.33 --> 1051.3
love I couldn't accept it so I kind of

1046.11 --> 1053.3999999999999
tried to over time like lift the veil a

1051.3 --> 1056.28
bit about the glory that was there and

1053.4 --> 1058.38
how from her position

1056.28 --> 1061.71
it doesn't seem appealing because she

1058.38 --> 1063.75
can't fathom the power it will bring

1061.71 --> 1065.46
that will absolutely change that around

1063.75 --> 1068.34
and make her a great mother as well and

1065.46 --> 1074.82
I really tried very carefully without

1068.34 --> 1078.1799999999998
triggering her to kind of show her what

1074.82 --> 1079.8
was up for grabs if she could find if

1078.18 --> 1082.8
she could muster the courage for it I

1079.8 --> 1085.35
really tried and didn't work because at

1082.8 --> 1087.51
some point I myself in the process kind

1085.35 --> 1089.9399999999998
of stumbled it became too much to me my

1087.51 --> 1094.53
fan finances ran out I was starting to

1089.94 --> 1097.14
go towards a panic position very bad

1094.53 --> 1099.35
especially in a relationship so kind of

1097.14 --> 1102.8100000000002
as I was doing it and she was taking

1099.35 --> 1106.59
very slowly but then I broke and then

1102.81 --> 1109.86
the whole thing just exploded or not

1106.59 --> 1113.36
exploded it it just all collapsed really

1109.86 --> 1118.1599999999999
quickly the whole spell the whole energy

1113.36 --> 1118.1599999999999
XJ don't collapse it was horrifying

1120.04 --> 1126.51
because I didn't take care of my

1121.93 --> 1128.92
foundations I was so obsessed about

1126.51 --> 1131.89
trying to get somewhere that I just

1128.92 --> 1134.47
didn't I didn't take care of my

1131.89 --> 1139.14
foundations in the process and then the

1134.47 --> 1145.78
Foundation's broke and I lost it yeah

1139.14 --> 1147.8500000000001
it's a lesson I'll never forget probably

1145.78 --> 1151.26
one of the most horrifying punishments

1147.85 --> 1151.26
I've ever endured in my life

1157.549 --> 1160.21
yeah

1165.849 --> 1172.72
all right

1168.85 --> 1176.1689999999999
anyway but punishment life punishment is

1172.72 --> 1180.34
only real punishment if you don't learn

1176.169 --> 1182.5590000000002
the lessons what you're being punished

1180.34 --> 1184.889
for basically because if you do learn it

1182.559 --> 1191.59
then it all can all turn around

1184.889 --> 1194.1299999999999
so yeah that's also kind of a overlooked

1191.59 --> 1198.509
the wisdom in general that counts almost

1194.13 --> 1201.159
everywhere you don't learn the lesson

1198.509 --> 1204.669
lessons from a punishment and you just

1201.159 --> 1208.24
get anger or whatever some kind of

1204.669 --> 1211.1490000000001
negative response then then it's gonna

1208.24 --> 1214.71
stay there until you learn the lesson

1211.149 --> 1218.549
that it can punish you for and then it

1214.71 --> 1221.6490000000001
suddenly lose the punishment subtly

1218.549 --> 1224.23
become something else it becomes a

1221.649 --> 1227.59
teaching of a lesson that can actually

1224.23 --> 1233.35
be regarded as valuable despite the

1227.59 --> 1236.519
earlier experience of the feelings at

1233.35 --> 1236.519
the start anyway

1242.17 --> 1247.96
what the sleeping boy what are you

1245.36 --> 1247.9599999999998
talking about

1250.48 --> 1253.53
which mark

1254.21 --> 1261.74
Oh marker Melbourne did you get the

1258.38 --> 1265.39
free-energy link in Skype no I did not

1261.74 --> 1265.39
mark of Melbourne sorry

1279.87 --> 1289.1689999999999
I still hope I will or or did somebody

1284.13 --> 1290.7600000000002
post it somewhere because I missed out

1289.169 --> 1294.51
on it if it wasn't a master beach

1290.76 --> 1296.7
somewhere I completely didn't see it

1294.51 --> 1304.23
because I haven't gotten on skype since

1296.7 --> 1307.95
I yes since this morning pretty much if

1304.23 --> 1312.48
you wanted me to get it then please post

1307.95 --> 1314.73
in a one-on-one chat or in my if you're

1312.48 --> 1317.419
in there in my flat earth early-bird

1314.73 --> 1317.419
chat Oh

1323.79 --> 1329.6599999999999
ah okay square earth with

1333.31 --> 1336.3
holy [ __ ]

1338.48 --> 1344.98
okay or he has elaborated some

1352.44 --> 1355.73
feels a little weird

1358.42 --> 1365.14
and a lot of presumption where these I

1362.26 --> 1368.8
don't know I'm getting all these what is

1365.14 --> 1371.7
it bullet point chapter names and they

1368.8 --> 1377.9099999999999
give me a weird feeling some of them are

1371.7 --> 1377.91
named very mythologically I don't know

1378.03 --> 1381.6
ten heavens

1385.65 --> 1392.63
I can contact him there all right

1389.6 --> 1398.6499999999999
okay thanks for that I will I guess I'll

1392.63 --> 1405.13
save this in my bookmarks Thanks

1398.65 --> 1405.13
interesting thank you Mark of Melbourne

1408.46 --> 1416.8700000000001
I'm going for the rectangular besides if

1414.2 --> 1419.8700000000001
you just look at the actual contours of

1416.87 --> 1422.9599999999998
his model it's not exactly square it's

1419.87 --> 1425.6299999999999
really more rectangular although he puts

1422.96 --> 1433.24
the whole thing inside of a virtual

1425.63 --> 1433.24
square for some reason don't know why

1451.53 --> 1455.96
the world stations what

1456.93 --> 1461.72
oh okay let's heavenly body relating

1463.58 --> 1467.1499999999999
that is so weird

1481.98 --> 1490.59
I I don't know it seems like this guy if

1488.519 --> 1493.2
I just look at this one pet it seems

1490.59 --> 1497.149
like this guy is categorizing this [ __ ]

1493.2 --> 1500.6390000000001
out of his model and I wonder how much

1497.149 --> 1505.559
seems some biblical references now from

1500.639 --> 1509.01
the Book of Enoch that's so odd I wonder

1505.559 --> 1512.19
if he's is got it right it just seems a

1509.01 --> 1517.139
bit out there I wonder how much he's

1512.19 --> 1519.299
confirmed has he confirmed any of it it

1517.139 --> 1521.4599999999998
seems a lot of presupposition and so

1519.299 --> 1526.11
much detail within them I wouldn't

1521.46 --> 1527.549
personally bring it that far but I don't

1526.11 --> 1532.9189999999999
know maybe he has very good reasons to

1527.549 --> 1536.6589999999999
maybe yeah maybe if if he'll contact me

1532.919 --> 1536.659
back I could find out

1542.09 --> 1545.09
what

1561.82 --> 1567.12
a little sleeping warrior you're in a

1563.89 --> 1567.1200000000001
funny mood today as she

1575.26 --> 1583.29
really Nathan you think that David Weiss

1579.1 --> 1583.29
is Starscream

1594.36 --> 1597.1999999999998
hmm

1598.25 --> 1603.77
and doesn't that exactly matching

1600.57 --> 1603.77
character if you ask me

1605.72 --> 1608.89
[Music]

1630.62 --> 1639.1399999999999
I did catch a bit of rent ease

1632.87 --> 1641.779
livestream I think still no it wasn't

1639.14 --> 1644.289
but I did see a part of it but man that

1641.779 --> 1648.5
video quality was really shitty on that

1644.289 --> 1650.809
but yeah the sound came through fine but

1648.5 --> 1653.02
the video was all just giant blocks and

1650.809 --> 1653.02
[ __ ]

1683.75 --> 1689.06
hey by the way if you guys want to just

1686.61 --> 1695.8799999999999
get on the panel and talk you know

1689.06 --> 1703.49
sleeping warrior Nathan Bryan TV's here

1695.88 --> 1703.49
might be sleeping late after yesterday

1710.57 --> 1716.83
yeah if you got something on your chest

1713.15 --> 1722.7800000000002
concerning debates or some stupid thing

1716.83 --> 1726.5
rumpus or whoever said recently by all

1722.78 --> 1731.83
means get him my panel and talk about it

1726.5 --> 1731.83
ah okay Nathan

1737.34 --> 1743.26
thanks for the superjet relate to tooand

1742.36 --> 1747.6699999999998
unicorn

1743.26 --> 1751.15
so the right flash and unicorn to

1747.67 --> 1754.89
Australian dollars right yeah thank you

1751.15 --> 1758.019
smash the super to at you chats

1754.89 --> 1758.019
[Music]

1781.79 --> 1784.9099999999999
[Music]

1789.72 --> 1795.94
yeah I look I completely missed out on

1793.929 --> 1797.95
everything that happened yesterday also

1795.94 --> 1801.8200000000002
ball busters haven't even clicked it yet

1797.95 --> 1807.13
sorry about that I was look I came home

1801.82 --> 1809.8899999999999
like 2 o'clock so in and I was very cold

1807.13 --> 1811.66
so I basically just smoked one and then

1809.89 --> 1820.75
went to bed as quickly as possible

1811.66 --> 1824.3700000000001
ah hey thanks Nathan Oakley for the 199

1820.75 --> 1824.37
pounds super jet donation

1839.879 --> 1846.49
sleeping where if you divide five by

1843.879 --> 1849.4499999999998
zero you get five times infinity come on

1846.49 --> 1849.45
you know that

1856.48 --> 1859.579
[Music]

1872.73 --> 1878.94
right I don't know all this issue about

1876.09 --> 1882.6299999999999
technical impossibilities with math like

1878.94 --> 1885.72
I Eve like it's very simple 1 divide out

1882.63 --> 1896.2700000000002
that whoops wrong box

1885.72 --> 1905.28
on divide by 0 is infinitely big and

1896.27 --> 1905.78
divided by 1 is small it's as simple as

1905.28 --> 1910.71
that

1905.78 --> 1918.66
that's what that stands for and if

1910.71 --> 1923.73
you're gonna multiply 5 or anything well

1918.66 --> 1926.3100000000002
5 times 0 is always 0 though the

1923.73 --> 1930.65
infinite big infinite small only works

1926.31 --> 1933.6299999999999
with divisions multiple 8ya

1930.65 --> 1936.24
multiplication zero is just always

1933.63 --> 1939.44
literally zero even in a technical and

1936.24 --> 1939.44
mathematical sense

1948.149 --> 1952.799
my Big Bang your PC yeah

1957.37 --> 1960.5
[Music]

1966.75 --> 1974.41
right David Reid yes it does that's the

1971.53 --> 1977.92
whole point the whole globe fantasy

1974.41 --> 1981.49
rests on a skeleton of mathematical

1977.92 --> 1991.41
apparent cohesion or of presumed

1981.49 --> 1996.04
cohesion control top-down hmm

1991.41 --> 1998.5600000000002
okay thank you flattened unicorn again

1996.04 --> 2006.08
for the two Australian dollar super chat

1998.56 --> 2006.08
donation fook yeah Nate Dogg oh please

2007.4 --> 2010.94
this really necessary

2025.5 --> 2030.73
as here check oh that depends on what

2028.419 --> 2034.45
you're trying to accomplish it's already

2030.73 --> 2039.76
said dividing something by zero makes an

2034.45 --> 2042.7
infinitely big structure as well it

2039.76 --> 2045.34
introduces an infinite big thing within

2042.7 --> 2048.9900000000002
it well that all depends then on what

2045.34 --> 2051.97
you're trying some kind of groundworks

2048.99 --> 2053.29
mathematical foundation what like it all

2051.97 --> 2055.7799999999997
depends on what you're trying to

2053.29 --> 2057.339
accomplish with your math a type of

2055.78 --> 2059.8590000000004
model you're trying to create and

2057.339 --> 2062.649
infinite big an infinite small can

2059.859 --> 2064.5989999999997
definitely be part of that and those are

2062.649 --> 2068.8889999999997
not even the most bizarre things that

2064.599 --> 2071.98
can be part of it like even the the

2068.889 --> 2073.3
issues like square root of minus 1 can

2071.98 --> 2079.96
be part of that that's even more

2073.3 --> 2083.28
ridiculous it really is you know math is

2079.96 --> 2083.28
basically structure

2108.52 --> 2114.22
Oh math really has nothing to do with

2110.68 --> 2119.95
real life that's the whole point but you

2114.22 --> 2123.04
can devise structures using math to kind

2119.95 --> 2127.8999999999996
of emulate circumstances in the real

2123.04 --> 2130.21
world and then if it works - satis the

2127.9 --> 2133.03
satisfaction of most and could even have

2130.21 --> 2135.75
some empirical feedback somehow to

2133.03 --> 2140.38
confirm that structure yeah Daniel

2135.75 --> 2145.03
yeah then it'll be accepted but only

2140.38 --> 2146.7400000000002
because it is a mathematical translation

2145.03 --> 2149.2000000000003
even though my it'll might have all

2146.74 --> 2152.0499999999997
started out with that of an actual

2149.2 --> 2157.3599999999997
physical empirical process that can be

2152.05 --> 2161.3100000000004
repeated like an experiment so math is

2157.36 --> 2163.4500000000003
only just the the mental ethereal

2161.31 --> 2166.81
construct that we construct with our

2163.45 --> 2171.7
mind using certain mechanics and

2166.81 --> 2175.0299999999997
standards that have been devised that

2171.7 --> 2179.5299999999997
way - yeah to be as applicable to the

2175.03 --> 2183.9
physical world as possible but that's an

2179.53 --> 2183.9
adaptation because by nature it is not

2184.59 --> 2192.84
it's not just what people have started

2189.19 --> 2192.84
to learn to use it for

2229.78 --> 2234.19
now sir check out this nice trick

2231.79 --> 2236.35
question look you have five apples and

2234.19 --> 2246.03
you divided among zero people how many

2236.35 --> 2246.0299999999997
do each get five get it

2254.49 --> 2262.08
because of the condition if there were

2257.55 --> 2267.0
to be any at least one then they would

2262.08 --> 2270.72
get five but there aren't any but if

2267.0 --> 2273.26
there were they would get five or if it

2270.72 --> 2275.79
were greater than one divided among them

2273.26 --> 2278.67
but it since there aren't any it's going

2275.79 --> 2279.99
to be five because none of them are

2278.67 --> 2283.01
going to get it so it's technically

2279.99 --> 2286.109
correct and it kind of fits the inquiry

2283.01 --> 2288.3300000000004
so that's yeah same X is a practical

2286.109 --> 2293.39
example of infinitely five times

2288.33 --> 2293.39
infinitely big it's nobody gonna get it

2307.62 --> 2323.74
yeah Trish you can say anything you like

2310.42 --> 2327.67
I just try to explain why and how what

2323.74 --> 2331.7799999999997
it is I prefer doing that actually give

2327.67 --> 2335.4900000000002
some backdrop understanding as to why

2331.78 --> 2335.4900000000002
things are the way they are

2336.09 --> 2339.2090000000003
[Music]

2344.369 --> 2351.359
hello Hannah bear Arum koala

2348.21 --> 2351.359
good day

2358.819 --> 2367.699
that's just what I said super curb it's

2364.039 --> 2369.8590000000004
five apples divided among zero people it

2367.699 --> 2374.4790000000003
they're going to get five because

2369.859 --> 2377.869
nobody's gonna get it but it would be

2374.479 --> 2379.9689999999996
technically adapted correctly to the

2377.869 --> 2392.4190000000003
mathematical inquiry of what it stands

2379.969 --> 2394.759
for because zero zero people is already

2392.419 --> 2398.179
kind of a mathematical conceptualization

2394.759 --> 2401.599
of a mathematize eight and mathematize

2398.179 --> 2404.199
ation yeah mathematize asian whatever

2401.599 --> 2404.199
you want to call it

2416.44 --> 2425.67
yeah you can it's just not a viable

2421.45 --> 2425.6699999999996
course of action but you can it

2441.67 --> 2445.4990000000003
[Music]

2448.54 --> 2453.96
I hope this is not too difficult for you

2465.65 --> 2471.89
dividing by zero is undefined

2468.69 --> 2471.89
no it's not

2479.589 --> 2486.43
no you know what try the square root of

2482.469 --> 2491.759
-1 now that is undefined try to define

2486.43 --> 2494.769
that other than symbolically okay

2491.759 --> 2495.849
anything divided by zero is not

2494.769 --> 2497.979
undefined

2495.849 --> 2500.4390000000003
that's nonsense there is a solution to

2497.979 --> 2502.39
it it's not a sensible solution but it

2500.439 --> 2505.019
is technically correct I just explained

2502.39 --> 2505.019
it like three times

2545.22 --> 2551.0
by definition and defined google it no

2551.51 --> 2555.599
[ __ ]

2552.75 --> 2559.46
I just defined it I don't I don't see

2555.599 --> 2562.069
why that cannot be acceptable in any way

2559.46 --> 2563.73
right

2562.069 --> 2567.48
indeed charlie

2563.73 --> 2572.2400000000002
that's all correct so now go by that

2567.48 --> 2576.69
standard and just realize that zero

2572.24 --> 2577.77
stands technically for you compare it to

2576.69 --> 2579.39
a vacuum

2577.77 --> 2581.609
there's no perfect vacuum well

2579.39 --> 2584.22
technically in any physical relation

2581.609 --> 2585.9
there can't be a perfect zero so if

2584.22 --> 2592.43
you're going to divide something by zero

2585.9 --> 2592.4300000000003
that technically means infinitely small

2592.49 --> 2598.7099999999996
or it would just be nonsense but there

2597.0 --> 2603.42
is a sensible way to take it and say

2598.71 --> 2608.839
infinitely small and then well you get

2603.42 --> 2608.839
five times infinite infinity basically

2625.25 --> 2637.28
no flexions leet unicorn if you want me

2628.01 --> 2642.44
to try that then maybe you want to be a

2637.28 --> 2646.8390000000004
test subject nah just kidding I'm not

2642.44 --> 2650.119
gonna spend that kind of nonsense

2646.839 --> 2653.93
besides with a bow you know it's mostly

2650.119 --> 2656.3
just it's not like it's installed with

2653.93 --> 2659.5099999999998
like perfect aiming and all that it's

2656.3 --> 2662.3590000000004
pretty much on the field so yeah it was

2659.51 --> 2664.7000000000003
good it pretty it can be pretty tough in

2662.359 --> 2667.91
itself just to try to account for any

2664.7 --> 2672.5789999999997
kind of wind okay well it can be done

2667.91 --> 2676.6299999999997
but yeah Coriolis come on ridiculous

2672.579 --> 2679.9
I've shot quite a few bows by the way

2676.63 --> 2682.13
well not like a huge amount but I should

2679.9 --> 2685.069
plenty enough to say that I've shot

2682.13 --> 2688.089
quite a few bow did quite a few both

2685.069 --> 2691.0099999999998
shots and there's never been any kind of

2688.089 --> 2693.77
orientation specific deviation that I

2691.01 --> 2698.0890000000004
have experienced never like that it's

2693.77 --> 2703.93
always just the wind and then finding

2698.089 --> 2707.71
the right position that's it

2703.93 --> 2707.71
zoning with my intuition

2709.369 --> 2717.259
oh okay oh sorry Nathan

2713.719 --> 2718.069
I didn't see ya it's on silent sorry

2717.259 --> 2727.5190000000002
about that

2718.069 --> 2737.029
let me are you don't see you oh all the

2727.519 --> 2738.68
way over there hello hello hello um so

2737.029 --> 2743.239
in your chat you've got that Charlie guy

2738.68 --> 2746.4199999999996
who you just said that 5/0 is infinity

2743.239 --> 2748.069
so I know you kind of alluded to it

2746.42 --> 2749.719
being mathematically possible as well

2748.069 --> 2751.46
but I'll give you a real world example

2749.719 --> 2752.66
and then you feel free to disagree with

2751.46 --> 2756.759
me however you like our witness that's

2752.66 --> 2760.7
okay sure so you've got you have got

2756.759 --> 2761.66
five apples in your shop is that like

2760.7 --> 2764.509
lots of different things including

2761.66 --> 2766.64
apples yeah and at the end of the day

2764.509 --> 2769.94
you're gonna work out how much you've

2766.64 --> 2772.069
sold now the way you work out how much

2769.94 --> 2774.279
you've sold is taking the original

2772.069 --> 2776.719
quantity of how many things you have and

2774.279 --> 2779.359
then working out based on how many of

2776.719 --> 2781.759
gone how much if you like it's been

2779.359 --> 2786.2
divided by leaves you with how many

2781.759 --> 2788.18
you've got left make sense so if you've

2786.2 --> 2790.6699999999996
got five apples on the shelf

2788.18 --> 2793.7
and at the end of the day when you're

2790.67 --> 2795.41
going through your maths you say right I

2793.7 --> 2797.239
will divide the amount

2795.41 --> 2799.0989999999997
I've got originally by the number of

2797.239 --> 2801.619
people I've sold to and the quantity

2799.099 --> 2806.15
they bought to give me the end number

2801.619 --> 2808.1600000000003
and if you've got two of somethink and

2806.15 --> 2811.1600000000003
one customers bought one you've sold one

2808.16 --> 2813.5589999999997
yeah yeah dude divided by one you've got

2811.16 --> 2815.96
one left therefore you've sold on so you

2813.559 --> 2817.9300000000003
put one in the quantity of salt well if

2815.96 --> 2821.829
you've got five apples

2817.93 --> 2824.68
and you've divided them by nobody who

2821.829 --> 2829.8390000000004
haven't divided them you've divided them

2824.68 --> 2833.8289999999997
by zero how many apples have you divided

2829.839 --> 2836.41
up or in other words sold okay yeah well

2833.829 --> 2840.309
there will be zero because you haven't

2836.41 --> 2842.3799999999997
divided them by anybody right because

2840.309 --> 2844.9
this is structurally based on a

2842.38 --> 2846.819
real-world example that could be

2844.9 --> 2850.869
translated to math instead of the other

2846.819 --> 2852.609
way around yeah exactly so in in real

2850.869 --> 2854.67
world terms you're looking at the number

2852.609 --> 2859.23
of apples you've got and you're saying

2854.67 --> 2865.059
five apples divided by zero people

2859.23 --> 2867.849
equals zero apples zero have sold not

2865.059 --> 2870.3390000000004
I've got five apples because dividing

2867.849 --> 2874.3
them up by no people doesn't give you

2870.339 --> 2876.46
five apples it gives you zero apples to

2874.3 --> 2879.25
divide up by anybody because you're not

2876.46 --> 2881.109
giving it a divisible number so Charlie

2879.25 --> 2885.39
in the chat saying well it divided five

2881.109 --> 2889.9
apples by zero and you get infinity

2885.39 --> 2891.7799999999997
apples no you don't that's incorrect if

2889.9 --> 2894.099
you haven't divided them up by anybody

2891.78 --> 2897.94
you haven't divided them up so the end

2894.099 --> 2900.819
result is zero not five and certainly

2897.94 --> 2902.589
not infinity not dividing something up

2900.819 --> 2904.299
by something doesn't give you any

2902.589 --> 2907.299
infinite amount of it right long snooze

2904.299 --> 2910.96
exactly but I also stated that by if you

2907.299 --> 2914.349
take zero as absolutely literal then

2910.96 --> 2917.68
yeah it is technically just nonsense but

2914.349 --> 2920.2000000000003
if you are going to enforce like a real

2917.68 --> 2923.5
life comparison to it then it would be

2920.2 --> 2926.9199999999996
taken as infinitely small and then you

2923.5 --> 2929.589
can sort of know because it's vitally

2926.92 --> 2932.349
becoming infinitely small if you divide

2929.589 --> 2936.19
your five apples up I know that's in the

2932.349 --> 2938.29
zero I know that I just said that I'm

2936.19 --> 2939.25
just saying you can take it in a

2938.29 --> 2941.89
different way

2939.25 --> 2943.81
well mathematically yeah you can

2941.89 --> 2946.87
describe

2943.81 --> 2949.54
it being divided divisible and ending up

2946.87 --> 2950.7999999999997
in infinity but in in real world and

2949.54 --> 2953.29
this is pretty much parroting what you

2950.8 --> 2956.0800000000004
said in real world application you can't

2953.29 --> 2958.3
do that so yes you can describe anything

2956.08 --> 2961.99
you like in language masters is a

2958.3 --> 2965.02
language I can describe a flying unicorn

2961.99 --> 2966.8799999999997
that farts out the gas we breathe I can

2965.02 --> 2970.57
describe that really accurately right

2966.88 --> 2973.36
down to the feathers so what so math is

2970.57 --> 2977.5
describing dividing 0 and ending up with

2973.36 --> 2979.42
infinity is nonsense isn't real world

2977.5 --> 2982.62
practical application of anything mate

2979.42 --> 2984.82
means nothing it's Monson's all right

2982.62 --> 2989.41
right that's all I wanted to say thank

2984.82 --> 2991.44
you for having me yeah I agree you take

2989.41 --> 2994.96
it literal yep

2991.44 --> 2999.57
are you robbing me all right thanks for

2994.96 --> 2999.57
coming down anything oh right No

3012.68 --> 3018.97
[Music]

3015.25 --> 3024.94
why is that funny what's wrong with my

3018.97 --> 3027.37
fingernails I'm not that bad it's bad

3024.94 --> 3032.62
about this yeah I forget my thumbnail

3027.37 --> 3035.0099999999998
but yeah I actually use them it's been a

3032.62 --> 3035.0099999999998
lot longer

3051.97 --> 3058.3689999999997
now star Isaac das is not wrong

3055.55 --> 3061.01
don't be ridiculous io is basically just

3058.369 --> 3064.55
laying out one point of my argument if

3061.01 --> 3066.71
you take zero as absolute literal yeah

3064.55 --> 3070.0
then it's just an incomplete query it's

3066.71 --> 3071.96
broken because that can only

3070.0 --> 3074.51
mathematically make any kind of sense

3071.96 --> 3078.43
not in a real-world example which was

3074.51 --> 3082.25
what it was based on in the first place

3078.43 --> 3085.5499999999997
but yeah if you don't if you approach it

3082.25 --> 3088.07
I guess more physically philosophically

3085.55 --> 3091.329
and say okay zero is just there is now

3088.07 --> 3094.6400000000003
zero so we're gonna take it as the

3091.329 --> 3106.9700000000003
conceptually smallest thing possible

3094.64 --> 3110.18
which is infinity divided by one maybe

3106.97 --> 3111.859
I'm just digging around with this I used

3110.18 --> 3114.47
to do that like 20 years ago as well

3111.859 --> 3117.44
argue at this point I don't know I don't

3114.47 --> 3120.5789999999997
really care that much you know

3117.44 --> 3120.579
[Music]

3128.0 --> 3130.72
okay

3132.06 --> 3135.31
[Music]

3151.27 --> 3160.06
oh wait no I got ya this is your correct

3157.96 --> 3163.42
mark colored I turn it around it's 1

3160.06 --> 3165.369
divided by infinity infinity divided by

3163.42 --> 3166.06
1 would simply be infinity that's

3165.369 --> 3173.1600000000003
correct

3166.06 --> 3173.16
oops yeah

3189.99 --> 3193.2599999999998
[Music]

3196.64 --> 3206.19
well ram-paige the ram-paige angel page

3200.63 --> 3210.15
okay it can be pretty worthwhile to do

3206.19 --> 3216.03
join Jose sometimes what I'm scheduled

3210.15 --> 3221.4
what are you talking about whatever fine

3216.03 --> 3224.88
I don't know but yeah to be on my own

3221.4 --> 3228.89
there with like rhombus George yes you

3224.88 --> 3231.69
can is Laurie and all that and and and

3228.89 --> 3234.87
those are those are not even the worst

3231.69 --> 3237.15
people yeah and your own it just sucks

3234.87 --> 3240.0299999999997
and it just can't really get between it

3237.15 --> 3244.94
nobody's gonna listen but if I'm there

3240.03 --> 3252.26
with other guys like at least Riley or

3244.94 --> 3256.26
plain truth Chris berry or even Ali or

3252.26 --> 3257.9700000000003
combination that kind of works that that

3256.26 --> 3261.0
kind of really does work it does tame

3257.97 --> 3264.4199999999996
their bank fast a little puts a little

3261.0 --> 3266.01
bit more pressure on them so but yeah if

3264.42 --> 3269.34
you're on your own up against nine

3266.01 --> 3272.07
ballers and just more even worse yeah

3269.34 --> 3274.56
that's not you it's very hard to get in

3272.07 --> 3278.51
between that just gonna be shaving you

3274.56 --> 3278.5099999999998
all the way and really sucks

3283.38 --> 3286.25
all right

3293.79 --> 3296.42
huh

3296.81 --> 3299.68
what's this

3301.15 --> 3314.559
whoo I got a notification for something

3304.18 --> 3317.6499999999996
that screamed what sixteen off what wow

3314.559 --> 3321.279
I just got a notification from YouTube

3317.65 --> 3328.839
for a video that streamed the 16th of

3321.279 --> 3333.46
August thanks YouTube Thanks it's a flat

3328.839 --> 3334.319
earth debate from 1608 that's just

3333.46 --> 3338.069
ridiculous

3334.319 --> 3338.069
YouTube's ridiculous

3345.32 --> 3353.78
[Music]

3357.9 --> 3360.949
[Music]

3365.4 --> 3370.46
wow you guys are really chewing in on

3368.01 --> 3373.0800000000004
this math issue aren't you

3370.46 --> 3376.76
what video no it was a notification

3373.08 --> 3379.5
pop-up from YouTube more colored like Oh

3376.76 --> 3381.0600000000004
Nathan oh please go home live right now

3379.5 --> 3383.4
and then I clicked on it just to check

3381.06 --> 3387.62
it out and it was a video that streamed

3383.4 --> 3387.62
live the 16th of August

3423.93 --> 3432.6
sir

3426.21 --> 3436.59
Wow that is weird so does that mean that

3432.6 --> 3441.0899999999997
there is a literal delay notification

3436.59 --> 3444.51
delay is it a bug or is it a button a

3441.09 --> 3448.9100000000003
secret button somebody pushes just to

3444.51 --> 3448.9100000000003
get in the way so weird

3464.79 --> 3470.79
oh by the way I don't know if I'm gonna

3468.63 --> 3472.61
get be monetized for this video or not

3470.79 --> 3476.94
but I really want to mention it that

3472.61 --> 3479.1
just such a bizarre thing that did you

3476.94 --> 3481.76
hear about PewDiePie yeah he did it

3479.1 --> 3486.96
again he did something really freaky

3481.76 --> 3490.46
like he apparently did a video at one

3486.96 --> 3492.78
point or life like yeah I'm donating a

3490.46 --> 3497.46
pretty substantial amount of money to

3492.78 --> 3499.2900000000004
the ADL and like his like it was so

3497.46 --> 3502.95
weird like he wouldn't know that that's

3499.29 --> 3505.71
a terrible organization that just spends

3502.95 --> 3509.3999999999996
a lot of time basically trying to censor

3505.71 --> 3513.03
a lot of Internet activities and then he

3509.4 --> 3518.39
retracted it after the fans outrage that

3513.03 --> 3518.3900000000003
was so what I haven't raw media what oh

3520.28 --> 3531.32
wait Adam is actually going live right
