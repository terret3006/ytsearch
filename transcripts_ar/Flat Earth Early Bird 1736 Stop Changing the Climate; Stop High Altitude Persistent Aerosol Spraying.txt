98.479 --> 104.119
again there's two things that are going

101.399 --> 107.88
to be written off and literally I don't

104.119 --> 109.6
even have enough for both right now

107.88 --> 112.96
yeah

109.6 --> 115.28
so yeah and this typically happens now

112.96 --> 115.27999999999999
every

116.159 --> 121.43900000000001
month so I'm literally piling up debts I

119.84 --> 125.43900000000001
I've been trying to tell you guys this

121.439 --> 125.439
is like the fifth month in a

125.84 --> 131.56
row

128.599 --> 137.23899999999998
anyway weather today

131.56 --> 139.12
is nice I guess but they trailed the

137.239 --> 142.519
hell out of the

139.12 --> 145.44
sky I don't know yeah there's a lot of

142.519 --> 150.12
wind though today so maybe they'll just

145.44 --> 155.2
blow apart kind of hope so but really

150.12 --> 157.76
they it's like a a checker board up

155.2 --> 160.35999999999999
there

157.76 --> 164.28
crazy yeah but it's been nice and

160.36 --> 167.8
sunny before that really started to get

164.28 --> 171.84
bad cuz like what is it 2 hours ago it

167.8 --> 171.84
was not like this

174.68 --> 177.31900000000002
yet all

176.2 --> 180.07999999999998
[Music]

177.319 --> 182.04
right but yeah despite all the Checker

180.08 --> 185.36
boards up there it's still kind of nice

182.04 --> 190.35999999999999
and sunny and it feels actually

185.36 --> 190.36
warm like even the wind is not

190.519 --> 193.519
cold

194.44 --> 201.12
check yeah yeah the wind is like a nice

198.56 --> 205.12
mild temperature like a spring

201.12 --> 205.12
temperature W wind very

208.68 --> 211.68
nice

212.76 --> 222.48
hello ter 306 first in chat good to see

217.28 --> 226.4
you can feel the sun shifting outward

222.48 --> 229.11999999999998
what di in temp

226.4 --> 231.07
okay realize that sun doesn't actually

229.12 --> 233.4
have a position

231.07 --> 236.56
[Music]

233.4 --> 240.159
right it's just

236.56 --> 244.31900000000002
weird it seems to go away but you can't

240.159 --> 248.04
trace it whatever you can think of it

244.319 --> 251.159
as being a heat Source over a disc

248.04 --> 255.239
having a literal position if you want to

251.159 --> 255.239
it does make the descriptions a lot

255.639 --> 261.0
easier I get

258.0 --> 261.0
it

261.04 --> 266.72
anyway it is Sunday the 1st of October

267.479 --> 274.4
2023 let's check the temperature it's

269.96 --> 277.28
probably 20 21 maybe

274.4 --> 280.28
more 23

277.28 --> 280.28
wow

284.88 --> 289.8
yeah according to this it's going to

287.12 --> 292.16
cool down again though during the

289.8 --> 296.0
weekdays until next

292.16 --> 296.0
weekend we'll see what

297.039 --> 303.68
happens yeah this this is kind of

300.039 --> 303.68
strange nice weather though for

309.24 --> 314.84000000000003
October but who knows there might be

311.68 --> 317.96
like a sudden dip at some point where it

314.84 --> 319.88
really just goes cold and really wet and

317.96 --> 324.08
it usually does in

319.88 --> 328.479
October somewhere whatever I'm ready for

324.08 --> 330.59999999999997
it sort of hello M AAL good to see

328.479 --> 332.88
you

330.6 --> 335.36
the non-local

332.88 --> 340.759
Hologram yeah the non-local Hol but to

335.36 --> 343.6
say the non-local Hologram is moving

340.759 --> 345.52000000000004
away that's kind of

343.6 --> 347.03900000000004
self-contradicting but I don't know it's

345.52 --> 350.35999999999996
it's also

347.039 --> 350.36
funny it's

358.479 --> 361.479
fine

362.28 --> 366.479
ler OCT we get blasting

368.759 --> 372.44
sunlight

370.919 --> 375.71999999999997
huh

372.44 --> 375.71999999999997
okay that's

388.4 --> 391.4
weird

392.68 --> 399.599
yeah okay yeah that sure it is there it

397.88 --> 403.28
yeah you're right about that it

399.599 --> 405.759
is nature warning you that war Winters

403.28 --> 405.75899999999996
around the

411.12 --> 417.0
corner 18 Dees in UK pretty warm for

414.12 --> 417.0
October

418.16 --> 425.759
yeah so so I I guess you could say that

421.72 --> 429.12
there is an exceptional after

425.759 --> 432.84000000000003
summer or that well maybe the summer

429.12 --> 436.36
actually just kind of shifted

432.84 --> 437.08
right I mean didn't winter really used

436.36 --> 441.08000000000004
to

437.08 --> 442.639
be in October and December like snow and

441.08 --> 446.44
stuff while

442.639 --> 448.84000000000003
now if there's any snow as far as I can

446.44 --> 450.4
remember it it mostly happens in

448.84 --> 455.28
February

450.4 --> 455.28
is so maybe the whole thing just

457.039 --> 462.28
shifted and the summer isn't

460.039 --> 468.919
actually those months that we think it

462.28 --> 474.55999999999995
is it's it now it's more like springtime

468.919 --> 476.479
is like May June and July and August is

474.56 --> 479.039
really the start of

476.479 --> 481.599
summer maybe if if you try to think of

479.039 --> 481.599
it like like

489.68 --> 496.68
that do you think we get all seasons

494.44 --> 500.199
within each SE

496.68 --> 502.40000000000003
what no but there is like micro Seasons

500.199 --> 504.40000000000003
right like the spring break effect the

502.4 --> 508.12
most famous

504.4 --> 510.31899999999996
one where there's like there's a big

508.12 --> 512.32
pattern and there's small patterns

510.319 --> 515.08
within the big pattern so there's like a

512.32 --> 517.599
back and forth little back and forths

515.08 --> 517.599
that does

521.599 --> 527.24
happen like it gets a bit warmer before

524.44 --> 529.12
it gets a lot colder or it gets a bit

527.24 --> 532.6800000000001
colder before it gets a lot

529.12 --> 532.68
warmer that sort of

538.2 --> 542.839
thing

539.8 --> 547.68
fractal season patterns yeah well you

542.839 --> 549.7600000000001
could think of it as such sure hey Dr

547.68 --> 552.4799999999999
utar B

549.76 --> 555.88
right ah back in the

552.48 --> 558.32
Netherlands yeah welcome back hello dank

555.88 --> 558.32
good to see

562.48 --> 568.12
you right but I mean they're really like

565.6 --> 571.0
I wish they just like leave the weather

568.12 --> 573.519
alone

571.0 --> 575.72
like we don't need tra like this is good

573.519 --> 578.519
what's the

575.72 --> 580.8000000000001
problem with it being a little warmer

578.519 --> 586.6
like what is supposed to be the problem

580.8 --> 589.64
what's like really so dangerous about

586.6 --> 592.399
it like what what in nature is it going

589.64 --> 596.04
to ruin seriously what in nature is it

592.399 --> 598.72
going to ruin if it stays a little

596.04 --> 601.279
longer the somra lasts a little longer

598.72 --> 603.48
like throughout what we normally think

601.279 --> 605.88
of as Autumn what's the problem with

603.48 --> 607.9590000000001
that is there anything in nature that's

605.88 --> 611.56
like suffering because of

607.959 --> 611.56
that I don't think

625.5 --> 631.24
[Music]

628.04 --> 634.1999999999999
so right unless you're dealing with like

631.24 --> 636.88
areas that are like very easily dried

634.2 --> 639.0790000000001
up and then if the heat lasts longer

636.88 --> 642.24
yeah then that can really suck

639.079 --> 645.1999999999999
especially for animals but I mean that's

642.24 --> 646.839
not this country though so we're not

645.2 --> 649.0
having any problems with that there's no

646.839 --> 652.8800000000001
reason to spray for that at

649.0 --> 655.079
all right and I don't even know if this

652.88 --> 657.36
kind of

655.079 --> 659.8389999999999
like season

657.36 --> 662.04
shift or

659.839 --> 664.2
March a seasonal March it's like the

662.04 --> 665.68
seasons are shifting over the year or

664.2 --> 667.8000000000001
you could just say well maybe the

665.68 --> 670.76
calendar is just kind of incompetent

667.8 --> 670.76
yeah good

671.76 --> 679.0
point but is that also happening like in

675.079 --> 681.6389999999999
this Sahara regions of Africa or as you

679.0 --> 685.44
said in India I mean there's probably

681.639 --> 687.9590000000001
regions in India where they have

685.44 --> 690.9590000000001
droughts it's a very big

687.959 --> 690.959
country

693.71 --> 699.279
[Music]

696.68 --> 701.519
yeah droughts and wildfires yeah sure

699.279 --> 701.519
but

705.68 --> 710.92
that's but my point is is like I'm

708.72 --> 715.399
noticing sort of what I could think of

710.92 --> 717.959
as a seasonal roulette or a shift here

715.399 --> 719.56
and I guess also in England and so the

717.959 --> 721.92
northern

719.56 --> 725.4399999999999
or at Le well Europe I mean America has

721.92 --> 725.4399999999999
really its own type of weather

727.6 --> 734.0
system but does that mean that that's

730.88 --> 737.68
happening everywhere on the earth is it

734.0 --> 741.04
climate change

737.68 --> 745.16
no well not like a not one that would

741.04 --> 747.88
fit any model except for well the model

745.16 --> 751.7199999999999
that I literally just thought up on the

747.88 --> 751.72
spot a seasonal

756.92 --> 760.92
shift okay hello

of like that

1200.36 --> 1205.8799999999999
but uh yeah the regular

1203.12 --> 1207.6789999999999
stuff the regular music yeah no we're

1205.88 --> 1210.1200000000001
not going to play that on my freaking

1207.679 --> 1211.679
wedding and I don't want any metal on my

1210.12 --> 1214.36
wedding I don't even want to marry

1211.679 --> 1218.5590000000002
somebody that's into that yeah you got

1214.36 --> 1218.559
that I don't want a metal

1224.28 --> 1230.12
chick they're not really my type overall

1228.48 --> 1234.48
sometimes I think they're really cool or

1230.12 --> 1234.4799999999998
sexy but I mean it doesn't actually

1239.64 --> 1245.44
connect and besides I'm not deranged

1242.32 --> 1245.4399999999998
enough for those types of

1247.64 --> 1250.779
[Music]

1257.12 --> 1260.12
women

1270.2 --> 1276.559
what would be the music I played on my

1273.44 --> 1278.48
wedding well that completely and totally

1276.559 --> 1279.84
depends on what kind of person I'm going

1278.48 --> 1284.32
to be

1279.84 --> 1284.32
marrying what type of music they would

1286.08 --> 1293.559
like but I'd like try to keep it

1290.84 --> 1296.8799999999999
more I don't

1293.559 --> 1299.36
know on first thought I would probably

1296.88 --> 1300.96
pick something of like Kate Bush or the

1299.36 --> 1303.76
police but that's because that's like

1300.96 --> 1303.76
really close at

1307.52 --> 1315.2
heart and not rock sand of

1310.84 --> 1319.039
course right nothing

1315.2 --> 1322.8400000000001
unappropriate but I mean definitely not

1319.039 --> 1322.84
freaking metal the

1322.88 --> 1326.7600000000002
hell walking on the

1326.84 --> 1334.039
moon I don't know it's more I'm not even

1330.44 --> 1337.3600000000001
saying a song from that it's just like

1334.039 --> 1340.12
more in that direction dude there's so

1337.36 --> 1342.0

1374.12 --> 1379.9599999999998

1572.12 --> 1577.36
I would listen to Somebody reading

reading a poem yeah that's how I

1577.36 --> 1581.4399999999998
categorize rap I don't categorize it as

1580.159 --> 1584.159
music it

1581.44 --> 1586.6000000000001
isn't might have noise on it and a bunch

1584.159 --> 1589.6000000000001
of rhythms that doesn't make it

1586.6 --> 1589.6
music

1593.94 --> 1600.279
[Music]

1597.0 --> 1602.96
just like literal like techno noise like

1602.96 --> 1610.1200000000001
jarring screeching sound effects that

1606.2 --> 1610.1200000000001

1646.84 --> 1649.52
into it

1650.88 --> 1655.0390000000002
that doesn't mean that I can't

1652.24 --> 1657.84
appreciate a good rap there are some

1655.039 --> 1660.76
like good lines that are just sometimes

1657.84 --> 1665.279
it's it can be very compelling I don't

1660.76 --> 1665.279
see it as music though it's

1674.0 --> 1680.799
not Christian

1676.24 --> 1680.799

secured fire

1798.24 --> 1804.039
extinguishers smoke

1801.159 --> 1806.3990000000001
detectors me being mostly home and awake

1804.039 --> 1809.08
even at

1806.399 --> 1811.4799999999998
night there's no fire going to be an

1809.08 --> 1811.48
issue

1819.76 --> 1825.0
here you're firem in the US oh okay

1822.72 --> 1828.72
shanders fair

1825.0 --> 1832.399
enough now I understand that you're

1828.72 --> 1832.3990000000001
question why you asked

1846.159 --> 1853.279
it

1847.679 --> 1855.679
one one and two well over here it's just

1853.279 --> 1858.96
one2

1855.679 --> 1860.799
and you like get a quick menu that asks

1858.96 --> 1864.3600000000001
you what type of emergency it is because

1860.799 --> 1864.36
it's connected to like a

1867.36 --> 1876.24
police uh hospital or like a medical

1872.6 --> 1878.519
emergency or uh fire e like it's the

1876.24 --> 1878.519
whole

1879.639 --> 1884.519
thing operator yeah we don't have

1882.2 --> 1886.519
operator we have like automated menus

1884.519 --> 1889.48
but as soon as you choose you do get a

1886.519 --> 1889.48
real personal on the

1889.72 --> 1897.0
phone oh wait no actually I think that

1892.88 --> 1897.0
somebody does immediately pick up and

1897.88 --> 1903.7990000000002
ask like what kind of it's not a a a

1901.32 --> 1908.559
robot

1903.799 --> 1910.76
voice but yeah man I've like called that

1908.559 --> 1914.12
like one time I

1910.76 --> 1919.1589999999999
maybe in the last eight

1914.12 --> 1919.1589999999999
years because there was a fire somewhere

1923.159 --> 1929.1200000000001
turned out some guy was just like trying

1925.399 --> 1931.9599999999998
to burn branches in some

1929.12 --> 1934.08
drum but it was like right next to a

1931.96 --> 1936.76
giant bush like you're [ __ ] out of

1934.08 --> 1939.48
your mind dude like that whole thing is

1936.76 --> 1942.8799999999999
going to go on fire it's like in the

1939.48 --> 1946.08
middle of the summer too like so yeah

1942.88 --> 1949.0800000000002
that made me call the fire

1946.08 --> 1949.08
department

1956.399 --> 1960.6
I think that they then eventually sent

1958.24 --> 1965.84
the police

1960.6 --> 1968.84
instead was weird anyway that was years

1965.84 --> 1970.6
ago usually like there's another number

1968.84 --> 1973.1999999999998
for just the police that's not an

1970.6 --> 1975.84
emergency and that's usually the number

1973.2 --> 1975.8400000000001
that I end up

1976.039 --> 1979.039
calling

1983.72 --> 1988.32
like if somebody's like making huge

1985.88 --> 1991.72
amounts of noise in the middle of the

1988.32 --> 1994.24
night just won't

1991.72 --> 1997.0
stop thankfully that doesn't really

1994.24 --> 1997.0

be able to get around with what I make

2804.0 --> 2807.8
then just the same

2810.319 --> 2815.48
way and it's

2812.44 --> 2818.559
extremely aggravating when I even think

2815.48 --> 2821.64
about it I try not to think about

2818.559 --> 2824.3190000000004

2861.16 --> 2865.72
personally kind of not really

2866.839 --> 2873.52
normal my priorities are

2870.96 --> 2875.52
different very different from a normal

2873.52 --> 2877.72
person even from somebody that's just

2875.52 --> 2879.599

refuse to recognize a feeling no no no

2894.359 --> 2901.2799999999997
not that kind but rather

2897.88 --> 2903.76
like somebody that would be like that

2901.28 --> 2906.2400000000002
got over it and then still had the

2903.76 --> 2908.6800000000003
issues and the issues are like yeah I

2906.24 --> 2911.4799999999996
still get carried

2908.68 --> 2913.2
away I'm not potting it up but I get

2911.48 --> 2915.88
carried

2913.2 --> 2918.3999999999996
away and where things happen when that

2915.88 --> 2921.6400000000003
when that happens and yeah I am crazy I

2918.4 --> 2926.119
get it but the world doesn't need to be

2921.64 --> 2926.1189999999997

looking at it you hear it and you're

3211.68 --> 3217.0789999999997
like you still can't believe it that

3213.839 --> 3218.2
that that they'd actually say that it

3217.079 --> 3222.6800000000003
was

3218.2 --> 3222.68
crazy so yeah hilarious

3224.96 --> 3230.319
show and I got quite a bit of input

3228.079 --> 3230.319
there

3231.76 --> 3237.119
too like I wasn't stumbling or I was

3234.839 --> 3240.48
well even QE said it like I was on fire

3237.119 --> 3244.1600000000003
so yeah I did feel like

3240.48 --> 3247.88
it I was just smoking the joints and

3244.16 --> 3251.44
Adam was taking the flagin and like we

3247.88 --> 3253.2400000000002
were both like two sides of a coin doing

3251.44 --> 3257.76
our

3253.24 --> 3257.7599999999998
thing while qwi was trying to do the

3264.079 --> 3267.079
show

3275.599 --> 3283.6400000000003
right that and what

3279.839 --> 3283.64
else what else is

3294.079 --> 3297.079
there

3301.52 --> 3308.079
oh yeah Dr Shiva had a pretty amazing

3304.599 --> 3309.76
video I just watched

3308.079 --> 3314.44
that

3309.76 --> 3317.119
like like there's like Dr Shiva videos

3314.44 --> 3320.119
and streams all the time I mean more

3317.119 --> 3324.0
than one a day like every

3320.119 --> 3327.079
day but yes like the one from

3324.0 --> 3329.28
yesterday was really interesting I

3327.079 --> 3332.6400000000003
watched it before the show because yeah

3329.28 --> 3332.6400000000003
I did get up pretty early

3336.68 --> 3342.24
today damn it I forgot exactly what it

3339.44 --> 3346.039
it was about voting systems about the

3342.24 --> 3347.5589999999997
voting machines like huge amount of

3346.039 --> 3349.7990000000004
references and

3347.559 --> 3353.3190000000004
interesting

3349.799 --> 3356.079
like Shiva just does so much detailed

3353.319 --> 3358.68
research about these things historical

3356.079 --> 3358.6800000000003
it's

3362.28 --> 3369.559
fascinating not often that Q pra yeah I

3365.72 --> 3372.2
know and he did it like three

3369.559 --> 3374.6800000000003
times I think that was just like he was

3372.2 --> 3377.96
just euphoric from

3374.68 --> 3380.1189999999997
Adam's inebriation or

3377.96 --> 3382.68
something it there was just something

3380.119 --> 3386.92
special in the air

3382.68 --> 3386.9199999999996
and it was great

3404.559 --> 3408.3590000000004
they're juicing bananas

3410.559 --> 3415.799
H leave the skin

3413.48 --> 3420.44
on why

3415.799 --> 3420.44
why the hell are you eating banana skin

3422.359 --> 3429.0789999999997
what you like it when me and qwi

3426.16 --> 3431.0789999999997
argue well fair enough tevision I like

3429.079 --> 3433.7200000000003
arguing with qwi more than I like

3431.079 --> 3437.2400000000002
arguing with Nathan because Nathan just

3433.72 --> 3437.24
always had that has

3438.24 --> 3443.2
that yeah he's just always like saying

3440.96 --> 3444.92
I'm wrong and [ __ ] he will later then

3443.2 --> 3447.2799999999997
figure out like wait no that means

3444.92 --> 3449.039
you're actually not wrong you will admit

3447.28 --> 3451.119
it but he always starts out saying I'm

3449.039 --> 3453.6800000000003
wrong for some damn reason I don't know

3451.119 --> 3455.799
why he does

3453.68 --> 3459.3999999999996
that but

3455.799 --> 3461.799
kwi now kwi is like a little more

3459.4 --> 3463.799
careful and I mean he is really smart

3461.799 --> 3466.88
and he does also recognize that I can

3463.799 --> 3469.64
also be really smart and it's

3466.88 --> 3472.1600000000003
great like when that when that

3469.64 --> 3474.5989999999997
simultaneously work like I'm focused and

3472.16 --> 3477.839
he is in for it like yeah we can have

3474.599 --> 3481.2000000000003
some really interesting back and forth I

3477.839 --> 3483.72
know that's how we got to the other day

3481.2 --> 3486.72
is it now 2 days ago 3 days ago how we

3483.72 --> 3490.2799999999997
had that conversation about

3486.72 --> 3492.68
the The Knowing witch path experiment

3490.28 --> 3495.2400000000002
that I discussed yesterday on the show

3492.68 --> 3498.5589999999997
did anybody actually take note of

3495.24 --> 3501.9599999999996
that I mean it wasn't the title but that

3498.559 --> 3504.0
was because of one of those types of

3501.96 --> 3506.359
conversations like I really figured it

3504.0 --> 3508.839
out now

3506.359 --> 3511.319
there's no more vagueness or like oh

3508.839 --> 3515.0389999999998
there's something not complete no no I

3511.319 --> 3517.319
get it now it's like it's it's closed

3515.039 --> 3517.3190000000004
it's

3524.839 --> 3527.839
complete

3529.559 --> 3536.7200000000003
what what are you talking about AUM

3533.72 --> 3536.72
virus

3541.359 --> 3546.359
kind of salty okay kind of

3555.64 --> 3560.319
weird does anybody have any clue as to

3558.44 --> 3562.64
what the [ __ ] Akuma virus is talking

3560.319 --> 3562.64
about

3563.64 --> 3566.64
here

3580.839 --> 3585.5589999999997
akum virus do you know what you're

3583.16 --> 3585.5589999999997
talking

3588.24 --> 3593.4799999999996
about or did that just accidentally roll

3591.0 --> 3593.48
out there

3593.64 --> 3596.64
somehow

3600.44 --> 3607.28
me and my experiences are wrong what

3602.92 --> 3609.079
take your me and Nathan what Nathan's

3607.28 --> 3611.0
attitude what the hell does Nathan's

3609.079 --> 3613.799
attitude have to do with me and my

3611.0 --> 3613.799
experiences are

3613.92 --> 3617.96
wrong what what does that even

3623.559 --> 3626.559
mean

3634.839 --> 3644.16
that's just kind of incoherent there Kum

3638.48 --> 3644.16
virus anyway I'm sry doing this G still

3647.0 --> 3653.559
cheers L say Nathan always says yeah at

3651.24 --> 3657.0389999999998
first right I interject with something

3653.559 --> 3659.2400000000002
and it's like no no and then sometimes

3657.039 --> 3661.4
later he's like oh yeah so it actually

3659.24 --> 3664.24
does mean that Arwin was right but he

3661.4 --> 3666.4
always starts out saying no no no I mean

3664.24 --> 3668.1189999999997
has anybody noticed that I mean I'm

3666.4 --> 3670.64
noticing it a

3668.119 --> 3672.6800000000003
lot and I mean at least I get

3670.64 --> 3674.2799999999997
recognition afterward but it is really

3672.68 --> 3675.799
kind of annoying that every time I come

3674.28 --> 3678.2400000000002
to the table with something it's always

3675.799 --> 3682.44
no no no Arwin you're

3678.24 --> 3684.16
wrong it's like uh yeah whatever we you

3682.44 --> 3686.44
just need some time to figure out how

3684.16 --> 3686.44
was right

3694.28 --> 3697.88
right anyway

3701.98 --> 3705.01
[Music]

3713.44 --> 3716.44
cheers

3719.2 --> 3725.24
all right but I mean in this way it's

3722.4 --> 3725.2400000000002
it's almost kind of

3725.799 --> 3730.559
funny he even does it to video what does

3729.599 --> 3733.52
that

3730.559 --> 3735.88
mean does it two videos what are you

3733.52 --> 3735.88
talking

3743.359 --> 3746.359
about

3769.0 --> 3773.359
yeah that's a good point can I mean it

3770.799 --> 3776.559
might be a focus issue

3773.359 --> 3778.52
yeah Nathan is very careful to formulate

3776.559 --> 3781.1600000000003
his thinking

3778.52 --> 3783.52
and well I do always with my

3781.16 --> 3785.5989999999997
interjections I do always like try to

3783.52 --> 3788.0
point out something that's not right on

3785.599 --> 3792.839
the menual but will come like afterwards

3788.0 --> 3795.48
like I tend to like point out side

3792.839 --> 3799.839
implications other structural insights

3795.48 --> 3802.2
than like what's what's at hand I do

3799.839 --> 3804.64
actually do that it's very rare that I

3802.2 --> 3807.1189999999997
point out like immediately relevant

3804.64 --> 3810.4
things and that is

3807.119 --> 3813.4
true but I do always like try to like

3810.4 --> 3816.48
grab a point that's right adjacent to it

3813.4 --> 3819.92
and that will be relevant to understand

3816.48 --> 3819.92
and that's where I always try to

3825.72 --> 3830.68
point I'm basically the guy that's like

3828.24 --> 3833.5989999999997
there to like remind you like oh don't

3830.68 --> 3836.5589999999997
get too focused on one thing remember

3833.599 --> 3840.2000000000003
all the other effects

3836.559 --> 3843.119
right that's kind of what I tend to do a

3840.2 --> 3845.5989999999997
lot cuz I am just very interested at the

3843.119 --> 3847.88
whole picture of everything that's

3845.599 --> 3849.4
happening and I see all those other

3847.88 --> 3851.559
things and a lot of people just don't

3849.4 --> 3854.039
really look at it but there's so much to

3851.559 --> 3854.039
learn

3857.559 --> 3862.039
there Nathan and Coro

3863.0 --> 3868.839
what just dismissed so much don't shut

3866.52 --> 3871.799
the [ __ ] up Akuma

3868.839 --> 3874.119
virus you don't get to even use that

3871.799 --> 3877.119
word

3874.119 --> 3877.119
bro

3884.319 --> 3888.48
yeah yeah this is not just because

3887.119 --> 3891.48
you're wrench doesn't mean you could

3888.48 --> 3894.92
just go and start go complaining pants

3891.48 --> 3897.76
and whining about Nathan here okay

3894.92 --> 3897.76
that's just hor

3900.079 --> 3906.6400000000003
[ __ ] yeah I mean I don't even let steamy

3903.76 --> 3909.1600000000003
traveler do it and I really like steamy

3906.64 --> 3912.72
traveler I find it very annoying when

3909.16 --> 3915.52
people try to use my show my chat to

3912.72 --> 3919.64
complain about Nathan Oakley

3915.52 --> 3922.48
yeah I don't do that myself I mean when

3919.64 --> 3925.64
I'm when something just happened and I

3922.48 --> 3927.48
felt censored and I need to get it off

3925.64 --> 3930.5989999999997
my chest yeah I'll do an item about it

3927.48 --> 3933.72
on my show because it's like I need to

3930.599 --> 3936.2400000000002
have my word be heard

3933.72 --> 3938.48
uninterrupted but that doesn't mean that

3936.24 --> 3940.64
oh well that means oh you're always

3938.48 --> 3942.559
welcome here to complain about Nathan

3940.64 --> 3944.0789999999997
Oakley like there's not enough places

3942.559 --> 3947.2400000000002
out there where you could already do

3944.079 --> 3949.44
that I'm pretty sure that mun would love

3947.24 --> 3952.7599999999998
to have you over on his channel so you

3949.44 --> 3954.599
could complain about Nathan Oakley okay

3952.76 --> 3956.88
so if you really want to do that just go

3954.599 --> 3956.88
over

3963.599 --> 3970.2000000000003
there yeah you do yeah I know well do it

3968.319 --> 3974.0389999999998
over there not over here it's very

3970.2 --> 3974.0389999999998
annoying and pointless and

3982.599 --> 3988.7200000000003
wrong you're large panel like fed even

3985.68 --> 3993.0
works with so many people yeah it's it's

3988.72 --> 3996.16
quite extraordinary even can of bear I

3993.0 --> 4000.92
mean literally try to find any kind of

3996.16 --> 4000.92
talk show thing out

4001.2 --> 4005.52
there with more than two

4005.92 --> 4011.0
people that actually works

4011.319 --> 4017.279
serious right find and any kind of

4015.24 --> 4019.7599999999998
talking program and I mean like that

4017.279 --> 4022.4
there's Millions if not hundreds of

4019.76 --> 4026.119
millions out there anyone that's like

4022.4 --> 4029.7200000000003
with more than two people in the show

4026.119 --> 4032.0
that works where not just one guy is

4029.72 --> 4035.16
always just sitting there being the

4032.0 --> 4037.48
Third Wheel right the fifth

4035.16 --> 4039.72
wheel because that happens a lot when

4037.48 --> 4042.0
it's just more it's you have two

4039.72 --> 4044.3999999999996
dominant people and just people kind of

4042.0 --> 4047.88
being there but not really adding to it

4044.4 --> 4050.64
they become like Spectators more that's

4047.88 --> 4055.0
how it works like with

4050.64 --> 4057.68
everything with us we're all very active

4055.0 --> 4061.88
and we all like even kind of struggle

4057.68 --> 4064.7599999999998
for for temporary dominance a

4061.88 --> 4067.4
bit like there's a lot of pressure on

4064.76 --> 4069.8390000000004
that attention plate there's multiple

4067.4 --> 4071.88
people that all have really sometimes

4069.839 --> 4075.92
urgent things to

4071.88 --> 4075.92
say it's very different

4078.319 --> 4082.72
I think that you could definitely

4079.839 --> 4085.16
compare our setup much more to Old

4082.72 --> 4089.52
University activity like old type

4085.16 --> 4091.359
debating like how university did things

4089.52 --> 4094.559
like in the 19th

4091.359 --> 4097.92
century like serious disciplines and

4094.559 --> 4097.92
debating and

4098.319 --> 4103.4400000000005
academics and perhaps even sometimes I

4101.279 --> 4106.279
dare to say like we're kind of like the

4103.44 --> 4106.2789999999995
old Greek

4106.52 --> 4111.4800000000005
philosophers I mean I don't think that

4108.759 --> 4113.279
our setup of what we do our circle with

4111.48 --> 4116.3589999999995
with

4113.279 --> 4118.2390000000005
the with the show that we're almost like

4116.359 --> 4120.92
it does feel sometimes like we're just

4118.239 --> 4122.718999999999
like old Greek philosophers that just

4120.92 --> 4126.12
like okay we're we're Gathering here

4122.719 --> 4129.719
we're going to do a couple of hours of

4126.12 --> 4132.0
discussing and figuring things out and

4129.719 --> 4134.2390000000005
Rumor Mill and all kind like just

4132.0 --> 4136.56
gathering information working it out and

4134.239 --> 4139.08
that must have been kind of what the old

4136.56 --> 4143.839000000001
Greeks did

4139.08 --> 4143.839
too with their philosophy

4145.839 --> 4152.839
culture Z super boring it

4149.199 --> 4155.48
isn't dude all Greek philosophers would

4152.839 --> 4159.239
literally

4155.48 --> 4161.199
like they would get very intense right

4159.239 --> 4162.959999999999
it wasn't just like let's agree to

4161.199 --> 4165.0
disagree no no sometimes they would

4162.96 --> 4166.52
literally assassinate their

4165.0 --> 4170.799
argumentative

4166.52 --> 4172.88
opponent it was that serious like that

4170.799 --> 4176.12
was the philosophy was serious business

4172.88 --> 4178.159000000001
for them it was very passionate and like

4176.12 --> 4180.92
whether they were respected or not and

4178.159 --> 4183.92
all that like everything hinged on that

4180.92 --> 4185.52
like if they became shameful or caught

4183.92 --> 4187.679
lying or

4185.52 --> 4190.6
whatever I think that you could actually

4187.679 --> 4192.719
get killed for that like by law I'm not

4190.6 --> 4197.360000000001
sure though you have to

4192.719 --> 4197.36
like that was oh fair enough

4200.44 --> 4206.839999999999
zy but I mean that's the closest thing

4204.04 --> 4209.159
that I tend to think of when I am like

4206.84 --> 4210.400000000001
being part of the FED show it just feels

4209.159 --> 4214.159
like wow it's

4210.4 --> 4217.599999999999
like old Greek philosophers doing their

4214.159 --> 4217.599999999999
thing having

4217.719 --> 4223.04
conference right and openly they did

4220.239 --> 4226.919999999999
that openly too right it wasn't like oh

4223.04 --> 4226.92
we're all closed doors no no

4227.679 --> 4233.84
no those debates were like on record in

4231.719 --> 4235.679
those times that's how they are records

4233.84 --> 4238.2390000000005
of

4235.679 --> 4240.28
them right and like people they didn't

4238.239 --> 4242.32
do it all in secret it wasn't like some

4240.28 --> 4246.32
secret conspiracy

4242.32 --> 4250.04
debate no it's like open debate and like

4246.32 --> 4252.96
people could just like go there and

4250.04 --> 4255.64
learn about it listen in as long as they

4252.96 --> 4255.64
didn't disrupt it

4256.76 --> 4260.52
anything yeah

4261.04 --> 4264.88
so that's kind of what we

4270.8 --> 4276.400000000001
do I'm glad that nobody's talking about

4273.52 --> 4278.159000000001
the same thing that I'm talking about

4276.4 --> 4281.48
why would I expect

4278.159 --> 4281.48
that oh

4282.56 --> 4285.56
well

4295.12 --> 4300.04
ah

4297.719 --> 4302.28
woman why the hell would you think that

4300.04 --> 4305.44
M AAL

4302.28 --> 4308.599999999999
is Phil Bell I mean Phil Bell does not

4305.44 --> 4312.04
talk like that you know how Phil B says

4308.6 --> 4313.96
things he has a very specific way of

4312.04 --> 4317.719
talking that he really thinks thinks

4313.96 --> 4317.719
like that's his way of saying

4318.4 --> 4325.28
things you can recognize Phil Bell very

4322.36 --> 4327.639
easily like yesterday remember that sock

4325.28 --> 4330.4
account that came in and just like oh

4327.639 --> 4333.32
hello everybody like that was probably

4330.4 --> 4336.799999999999
Phil Bell he deleted the account

4333.32 --> 4336.799999999999
immediately after I banned

4342.48 --> 4345.48
him

4347.719 --> 4350.92

4375.44 --> 4382.599999999999
okay there is one question though em

4378.199 --> 4382.599999999999
AAL is Phil Bell your

4402.36 --> 4406.92
father

4404.36 --> 4409.5599999999995

4422.199 --> 4427.32
yes is Phil B my father what the hell

4424.92 --> 4430.679

4427.32 --> 4430.679
he your father I

4432.36 --> 4440.5199999999995
mean is there something that prevents

4436.36 --> 4440.5199999999995
you from just answering yes or

4447.85 --> 4450.979
[Music]

4464.52 --> 4472.080000000001
here you go that's a direct answer

4468.04 --> 4472.08
so where's your direct

4488.44 --> 4492.28
answer ah there you

4491.02 --> 4496.56
[Music]

4492.28 --> 4496.5599999999995
go yeah just had to

4498.96 --> 4504.2390000000005
check very fish no yeah

4504.639 --> 4512.04
no was that meant to be funny yes but

4508.96 --> 4512.04
also I don't

4522.199 --> 4525.199
know

4539.8 --> 4543.4400000000005
she said she wanted to

4545.48 --> 4552.199
dat

4547.92 --> 4554.4400000000005
eie you mean Eevee 97 she said

4552.199 --> 4557.678999999999
that

4554.44 --> 4561.32
cash what Cash Cow company though that's

4557.679 --> 4561.32
hilarious by the way ruus in

4574.0 --> 4581.92
hubin but seriously what is this oh

4577.159 --> 4581.92
maybe did she mean like

4582.12 --> 4586.36
GTI

4584.08 --> 4588.08
I mean technically it is kind of a cash

4586.36 --> 4589.88
cow company

4588.08 --> 4593.239
but

4589.88 --> 4594.679
yeah it's not like you just immediately

4593.239 --> 4595.959999999999
yeah the crypto thing all right all

4594.679 --> 4600.4
right fair

4595.96 --> 4600.4
enough if she wants to date me I

4600.719 --> 4606.8
mean i' I'd like to meet let's just meet

4604.28 --> 4611.239
and talk and maybe like have dinner or

4606.8 --> 4613.679
something and we'll see you

4611.239 --> 4616.959999999999
know but I mean at least she's a

4613.679 --> 4618.719
resourceful woman so that is definitely

4616.96 --> 4621.639
a

4618.719 --> 4624.44
plus also she's kind of straight forward

4621.639 --> 4626.8
which can be [ __ ] annoying but also a

4624.44 --> 4626.799999999999
big

4630.04 --> 4638.36
plus she didn't really look ugly if that

4634.08 --> 4643.04
picture is really hers so

4638.36 --> 4645.239
yeah I don't know I'm yeah I'm not hey I

4643.04 --> 4645.239
I'm

4672.0 --> 4675.0
here

4681.4 --> 4687.48
no blue Devolution doesn't work that

4685.0 --> 4692.719
way now there's plenty of people that

4687.48 --> 4692.718999999999
don't make content that are just chat

4694.199 --> 4698.799999999999
participants and it's not a bad attitude

4700.32 --> 4704.199
either

4701.92 --> 4707.12
dude

4704.199 --> 4707.12
you're talking to a

4710.8 --> 4714.4800000000005
woman you might want to check your

4712.96 --> 4718.76
attitude

4714.48 --> 4718.759999999999
yeah I'm sorry but

4718.8 --> 4726.12
seriously this is not a man only type of

4722.56 --> 4727.96
room okay females are definitely allowed

4726.12 --> 4731.12
here

4727.96 --> 4733.8
and the the most important part that

4731.12 --> 4737.159
they have to tolerate so some level of

4733.8 --> 4738.8
sexist humor and all that right that's

4737.159 --> 4742.5599999999995
just my

4738.8 --> 4744.88
demand but other than that yeah they do

4742.56 --> 4748.080000000001
actually like work a little

4744.88 --> 4752.52
different how do I know that I know

4748.08 --> 4752.5199999999995
that I can smell it through the

4761.84 --> 4764.84
chat

4769.159 --> 4776.44
it just watch people talk I mean I see M

4772.4 --> 4779.799999999999
AAL talk like with other people in chats

4776.44 --> 4782.919999999999
where I'm not taking part like I'm

4779.8 --> 4785.84
actually literally watching you yeah

4782.92 --> 4788.4800000000005
like I keep a close eye on you I keep a

4785.84 --> 4791.719
close eye on you I keep a close eye on

4788.48 --> 4794.0
you raie that oh so scary yeah yeah but

4791.719 --> 4796.6
I actually do I keep a close eye on

4794.0 --> 4800.36
people to see what their consistent

4796.6 --> 4804.320000000001
behavior is and thereby figuring out if

4800.36 --> 4807.04
they have a actor or like an acted

4804.32 --> 4810.0
format and what their normal format is

4807.04 --> 4813.239
and thereby determine what type of

4810.0 --> 4816.96
person they really are and if that fits

4813.239 --> 4819.12
a female structural profile or a male

4816.96 --> 4821.6
structural profile because there is a

4819.12 --> 4823.96
distinct difference that I literally

4821.6 --> 4827.08
cannot explain I can only meta explain

4823.96 --> 4829.08
it like this because it's a feel thing

4827.08 --> 4833.08
but it's

4829.08 --> 4835.5599999999995
100% And it's so 100% that even like

4833.08 --> 4839.5199999999995
women that really that are like trans

4835.56 --> 4841.56
and really like Oh I'm a man they still

4839.52 --> 4845.76
fit that profile it's like you can't

4841.56 --> 4848.76
hide it you can act like the other side

4845.76 --> 4851.719
all you want but you'll still work like

4848.76 --> 4853.4800000000005
that you'll still have the same type

4851.719 --> 4856.4
of

4853.48 --> 4859.04
reactionary responses with the same

4856.4 --> 4861.799999999999
timings and men have different from

4859.04 --> 4865.4
women and they always do no matter how

4861.8 --> 4865.400000000001
they feel about themselves or the

4871.12 --> 4878.12
world like a woman being accused

4873.8 --> 4878.12
responds very different from a man being

4879.679 --> 4886.4
accused there's a distinct difference

4882.4 --> 4886.4
that is subtle but it is very

4897.71 --> 4900.85
[Music]

4902.56 --> 4906.400000000001
persistent like for example did you know

4904.84 --> 4910.8
on average

4906.4 --> 4912.599999999999
that this is my insight I might be I

4910.8 --> 4914.92
don't know maybe there's some statistic

4912.6 --> 4918.280000000001
iCal research that proves me wrong but

4914.92 --> 4920.84
from what I've seen I've noticed that on

4918.28 --> 4924.48
average women especially on the internet

4920.84 --> 4928.2390000000005
are much more used to getting

4924.48 --> 4932.799999999999
accused and are like

4928.239 --> 4935.839999999999
more capable on average of basically

4932.8 --> 4939.0
defending against that sensibly compared

4935.84 --> 4943.679
to males which tend to like get more

4939.0 --> 4946.52
really angry in response instead

4943.679 --> 4949.8
that all depends on the character of

4946.52 --> 4954.2390000000005
course but like yeah it's

4949.8 --> 4956.0
just it's just different like I notice

4954.239 --> 4958.879999999999
like men getting accused like either

4956.0 --> 4961.44
they don't give a [ __ ] or they get like

4958.88 --> 4965.08
ha or they're like what the [ __ ] are you

4961.44 --> 4967.719
talking about a woman of like Eevee and

4965.08 --> 4969.639
Emma they'll like go into like real Ser

4967.719 --> 4971.56
like they'll literally make a case out

4969.639 --> 4973.4400000000005
of

4971.56 --> 4975.080000000001
it

4973.44 --> 4977.32
like especially Eevee and it's kind of

4975.08 --> 4979.199
annoying when she does that somebody

4977.32 --> 4981.599999999999
just blurts out something that's kind of

4979.199 --> 4983.678999999999
stupid and then she's like oh let's make

4981.6 --> 4985.6
an exact case of this and then she like

4983.679 --> 4989.719
makes a presentation out of it

4985.6 --> 4989.719
everybody's like ah Eevee just shut

4990.52 --> 4995.719
up I have only seen like women do

5001.48 --> 5004.48
that

5014.04 --> 5019.04
you don't need to write

5016.12 --> 5022.84
permission yeah yeah I agree blue pill

5019.04 --> 5024.76
deu I like you bro seriously and thank

5022.84 --> 5027.32
you very much for the support you have

5024.76 --> 5028.12
actually helped to yeah to perpetuate

5027.32 --> 5031.04
the

5028.12 --> 5035.639
show but seriously like come on lay off

5031.04 --> 5035.639
the girls the girls in my chat

5057.12 --> 5061.12
please Emma you could make a video about

5060.08 --> 5064.44
that by the

5061.12 --> 5065.76
way like you make a mug shot of yourself

5064.44 --> 5068.04
like a little video like you're making a

5065.76 --> 5071.159000000001
mug shot of yourself and then

5068.04 --> 5074.5199999999995
say I don't make

5071.159 --> 5076.44
content it's not a crime and that be

5074.52 --> 5078.639
that have that be your only video on

5076.44 --> 5078.638999999999
your

5078.92 --> 5082.4400000000005
channel how about

5091.36 --> 5094.36
that

5102.36 --> 5106.4
I mean seriously I don't make content

5104.36 --> 5108.839999999999
it's not a crime that should be a thing

5106.4 --> 5112.799999999999
that's like in the about section on

5108.84 --> 5112.8
YouTube channels like

5114.92 --> 5120.28
that so what do you think M are you

5117.48 --> 5124.28
going to make a little

5120.28 --> 5124.28
video that would be pretty cool

5133.639 --> 5140.76
is the saying piece

5137.08 --> 5145.239
what a peace is like a part of something

5140.76 --> 5145.2390000000005
peace is the opposite of

5150.52 --> 5156.159000000001
War so so you could give somebody a

5153.8 --> 5162.400000000001
piece of your mind right which means

5156.159 --> 5166.36
share your thoughts that's p i uh e c e

5162.4 --> 5170.48
right but if you want peace of mind that

5166.36 --> 5174.239
means no war peace of your mind so then

5170.48 --> 5177.799999999999
it's p a c yeah I know that's not

5174.239 --> 5180.199
confusing at all right but it is

5177.8 --> 5182.8
different so I'm G to give you a piece

5180.199 --> 5185.879999999999
of my mind is different from

5182.8 --> 5187.52
the peace of mind I I want peace of mind

5185.88 --> 5191.56
that's completely

5187.52 --> 5191.56
different it sounds the same

5196.92 --> 5202.92
though said my piece yeah that's with EA

5204.96 --> 5213.199
indeed that is correct though that is

5208.48 --> 5216.678999999999
right it's not I've said my piece it's

5213.199 --> 5220.799999999999
said like I

5216.679 --> 5223.92
speak what is that act now I'm like conf

5220.8 --> 5223.92
wait I'm going to look this

5224.76 --> 5228.8
up now it is saying your

5229.119 --> 5233.0
piece oh wait what is

5233.28 --> 5237.04
it hold your

5235.52 --> 5240.360000000001
piece

5237.04 --> 5242.88
ah yeah oh yeah yeah no

5240.36 --> 5246.5199999999995
it's wow

5242.88 --> 5249.0
so it is actually piece as in a piece of

5246.52 --> 5253.56
something saying your peace it's like

5249.0 --> 5253.56
saying your part it is with

5254.679 --> 5262.96
ie but when you say hold your peace then

5258.92 --> 5266.4800000000005
it is stay at

5262.96 --> 5269.0
ease so it's is it is then with EA man

5266.48 --> 5274.119
this is not confusing at all and I'm not

5269.0 --> 5274.119
being sarcastic right now yes I am

5278.159 --> 5285.96
you said my piece

5280.96 --> 5285.96
yeah to make my peace yeah yeah yeah

5301.04 --> 5304.04
exactly

5304.1 --> 5307.189
[Music]

5322.28 --> 5328.28
right my God they're still freaking

5324.8 --> 5330.6
doing look at this they're still

5328.28 --> 5334.0
spraying right now there's a [ __ ]

5330.6 --> 5334.0
plane over there doing that

5334.119 --> 5337.719
right now it's doing

5338.48 --> 5342.599999999999
that what the [ __ ] your

5344.199 --> 5350.0
problem can you see that that stupid

5346.96 --> 5351.96
little needle there it's spraying right

5350.0 --> 5353.92
now thanks a [ __ ] lot it's not like

5351.96 --> 5356.88
we have don't have enough of that [ __ ]

5353.92 --> 5356.88
hanging around up

5360.92 --> 5363.92
there

5374.52 --> 5377.679
hey Ed G good to see

5381.32 --> 5387.08
you give them a piece of my mind what's

5384.639 --> 5389.32
the get I mean it's I'm just saying

5387.08 --> 5393.199
you're [ __ ] it up there's no reason

5389.32 --> 5395.759999999999
to do any of that no spr spraying like

5393.199 --> 5397.44
I'm not even oh chemicals I don't even

5395.76 --> 5399.119000000001
think they spray with chemicals

5397.44 --> 5401.678999999999
seriously I don't think they

5399.119 --> 5404.92
do I really hope they don't because if

5401.679 --> 5407.4400000000005
they did well yeah that I mean that's

5404.92 --> 5409.88
going to be a gigantic detriment to all

5407.44 --> 5412.159
life and the soil and like that

5409.88 --> 5415.639
compounds over time and

5412.159 --> 5418.0
it's it's just

5415.639 --> 5420.400000000001
disastrous so I'm just assuming they're

5418.0 --> 5422.52
not doing it with chemicals and then

5420.4 --> 5424.5599999999995
it's still freaking pointless like why

5422.52 --> 5428.56
the [ __ ] would you need to do that right

5424.56 --> 5432.400000000001
now why can't you just let the weather

5428.56 --> 5434.080000000001
be the freaking weather the way it is

5432.4 --> 5437.879999999999
what the [ __ ] supposed to be the

5434.08 --> 5440.6
problem here just let it be nice and

5437.88 --> 5440.6
warm and

5440.96 --> 5449.76
sunny stop ruining the nice

5445.84 --> 5452.400000000001
weather yeah we don't [ __ ] care that

5449.76 --> 5454.96
oh it's weird it's one October it's not

5452.4 --> 5457.679
supposed to be like [ __ ] you this is the

5454.96 --> 5461.84
weather let it [ __ ]

5457.679 --> 5461.84
be leave the weather

5738.679 --> 5746.0
yeah you saw it happening on

5743.159 --> 5748.08
camera and it is a thing I mean oh

5746.0 --> 5750.44
climate change yeah you're literally

5748.08 --> 5753.92
[ __ ] [ __ ] with the climate you're

5750.44 --> 5756.159
literally Prov doing that yeah I don't

5753.92 --> 5757.679
give a [ __ ] about your stupid ass ball

5756.159 --> 5760.92
based model

5757.679 --> 5762.4400000000005
nonsense these actions are

5760.92 --> 5766.159
happening

5762.44 --> 5768.4
yeah persistent aerosol spraying is

5766.159 --> 5771.04
provably happening it's like it's not

5768.4 --> 5775.32
even relevant what it is it's just that

5771.04 --> 5778.719
it is persistent aerosol that's a

5775.32 --> 5782.239
fact it is happening it's being

5778.719 --> 5785.44
done and I'd like them to stop doing

5782.239 --> 5788.879999999999
that because you are messing with the

5785.44 --> 5793.678999999999
climate when you do that you don't know

5788.88 --> 5793.679
the longterm consequences of doing

5795.119 --> 5799.96
that and who the [ __ ] are you to

5797.96 --> 5802.52
determine that it has to be different

5799.96 --> 5807.2390000000005
weather at this time who the [ __ ] are

5802.52 --> 5810.84

5807.239 --> 5814.5199999999995
blue skyed then just let it [ __ ] be

5810.84 --> 5817.96
sunny in Blue Sky yeah stop trying to

5814.52 --> 5817.96
change the [ __ ]

5824.08 --> 5828.04
climate oh god look is

5840.199 --> 5843.199
here

5859.199 --> 5863.919999999999
water yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock yeah yeah

5862.0 --> 5867.199
but you know what happens with

5863.92 --> 5870.4400000000005
water when you spray at a high altitude

5867.199 --> 5872.96
like way above Cloud altitude you know

5870.44 --> 5875.0
what happens

5872.96 --> 5876.52
it

5875.0 --> 5880.32
dissolves

5876.52 --> 5883.1990000000005
yeah what happened to contrails yeah

5880.32 --> 5886.199
yeah when it

5883.199 --> 5886.199
doesn't

5887.119 --> 5895.32
dissolve then it has to be persistent

5891.76 --> 5898.159000000001
aerosol because it's not condensation

5895.32 --> 5901.92
and it's not dissolving all condensation

5898.159 --> 5904.08
will dissolve always no exception

5901.92 --> 5908.56
yeah now it's not Cloud

5904.08 --> 5910.599
height yeah clouds are much much lower

5908.56 --> 5915.280000000001
than where there's being

5910.599 --> 5919.2390000000005
sprayed yeah water cannot stay droplets

5915.28 --> 5922.119
at that height it can't it's going to

5919.239 --> 5924.879999999999
evaporate very

5922.119 --> 5928.199
quickly only

5924.88 --> 5934.32
non water

5928.199 --> 5937.5199999999995
particles will stay visible and

5934.32 --> 5941.0
non-transparent because water

5937.52 --> 5944.88
particles will evaporate and thereby

5941.0 --> 5948.239
become transparent part of the whole

5944.88 --> 5952.28
yeah it's not condensation

5948.239 --> 5955.5599999999995
Trails if they keep hanging around and

5952.28 --> 5958.88
they are and they're hazing up the place

5955.56 --> 5962.159000000001
yeah that's called persistent aerosol

5958.88 --> 5965.639
spraying not contrails contrails

5962.159 --> 5968.5199999999995
dissolve at that height always no

5965.639 --> 5971.2390000000005
exception doesn't matter where on Earth

5968.52 --> 5977.159000000001
you are what type of climate it is at

5971.239 --> 5980.48
those Heights all condensation will

5977.159 --> 5984.36
evaporate you'll see a little line some

5980.48 --> 5986.799999999999
sort of a a little cloudlike look yeah

5984.36 --> 5989.5599999999995
and then it cools

5986.8 --> 5993.0
off and then it

5989.56 --> 5994.84
evaporates always

5993.0 --> 6000.88
that's what water

5994.84 --> 6003.639
does if it doesn't do that then it's not

6000.88 --> 6008.400000000001
water if it keeps hanging

6003.639 --> 6013.1990000000005
around it's not water it's persistent

6008.4 --> 6013.199
aerosol a solid

6014.36 --> 6017.36
particle

6019.96 --> 6022.96
yeah

6029.92 --> 6037.4400000000005
a b Sanford well I I mean as far as I'm

6033.719 --> 6037.44
concerned he's like Sean Hawkins

6043.52 --> 6048.080000000001
now I I this I don't really care about

6046.52 --> 6052.92
what George has to

6048.08 --> 6052.92
say it's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

6072.76 --> 6077.0
promote videos that insult them well

6075.159 --> 6079.5199999999995
he's not doing that

6077.0 --> 6082.76
Emma he's not promoting videos that

6079.52 --> 6086.92
insult me he literally just copied my

6082.76 --> 6090.8
video and like really lazy bastard put

6086.92 --> 6090.8
another title over it

6091.48 --> 6098.5199999999995
yeah and then it's gone because there's

6096.36 --> 6101.5199999999995
such a thing is

6098.52 --> 6101.52
copyright

how my videos would put me in a bad

6151.28 --> 6156.8
light though at

6153.44 --> 6158.719
all but if he just if he does that and

6156.8 --> 6159.8
he keeps altering the title into

6158.719 --> 6161.8
something

6159.8 --> 6163.52
shitty well yeah then I'm going to

6161.8 --> 6167.599

6231.96 --> 6237.159
potential ad Revenue away from my

6234.56 --> 6238.159000000001
channel by copying entire shows without

6237.159 --> 6241.5599999999995
my

6238.159 --> 6241.5599999999995
permission that's the

6242.04 --> 6249.32

that means sharing the link to my

6271.76 --> 6278.4400000000005

it you see no difference oh yeah well I

6288.719 --> 6292.56
do and so does you

6296.86 --> 6300.25
[Music]

6307.119 --> 6311.28
right I've already said hey you want to

6308.599 --> 6313.719
make little stupid little Clips you want

6311.28 --> 6315.32
some commentary on added to dude you can

6313.719 --> 6317.76
make a whole career out of that

6315.32 --> 6321.159
apparently you'll make more money than I

6317.76 --> 6323.96
do just making stupid little videos

6321.159 --> 6326.598999999999
complaining about Arwin I'm sure you

6323.96 --> 6328.96
will and you have my permission to do

6326.599 --> 6331.599
that no matter how [ __ ] [ __ ] you

6328.96 --> 6334.36
make yourself look I don't

6331.599 --> 6337.0
care but you're just not going to copy

6334.36 --> 6337.0
my entire

6345.719 --> 6351.4800000000005
shows

6347.4 --> 6356.32
yeah so let me be clear when I say

6351.48 --> 6360.199
share that means sharing the link to the

6356.32 --> 6363.599
video yeah like when you click share is

6360.199 --> 6366.199
say share in a post share share Facebook

6363.599 --> 6369.639
WhatsApp email Twitter they still say

6366.199 --> 6372.199
Twitter not X how dare you YouTube yeah

6369.639 --> 6374.719
all these things you can share it on

6372.199 --> 6378.5599999999995
does any of these things actually like

6374.719 --> 6380.639
oh let's click on this one and then you

6378.56 --> 6383.639
go to your channel there and

6380.639 --> 6384.679
automatically copy the entire video on

6383.639 --> 6387.639
your

6384.679 --> 6389.0
channel is that share is that in the

6387.639 --> 6390.719
share

6389.0 --> 6394.88
function

6390.719 --> 6399.84
anywhere no no it isn't because sharing

6394.88 --> 6402.28
is literally copying the browser link of

6399.84 --> 6407.92
the video at

6402.28 --> 6413.28
question yeah not copying the entire

6407.92 --> 6415.719
live stream video to another Channel or

6413.28 --> 6420.119
platform

6415.719 --> 6420.119
yes is that clear enough for

6423.76 --> 6428.8
you reupload a Shir yeah no no no

6426.719 --> 6432.4
re-uploading is

6428.8 --> 6436.08
re-uploading sharing is sharing yeah

6432.4 --> 6440.48
copying re-uploading they have separate

6436.08 --> 6443.96
words that will be implicitly used when

6440.48 --> 6446.959999999999
those things are specifically requested

6443.96 --> 6450.0
yeah like for example when Alex Jones

6446.96 --> 6453.32
talked about his movies especially like

6450.0 --> 6456.56
10 years ago and more you would say

6453.32 --> 6459.159
reupload it on your own channel copy

6456.56 --> 6460.96
these videos on your discs and hand them

6459.159 --> 6463.92
out

6460.96 --> 6466.08
yeah that's what he said he didn't just

6463.92 --> 6468.92
say oh just share it share it wherever

6466.08 --> 6472.44
you like no no no he said share it share

6468.92 --> 6474.96
it copy it make your own copies uploaded

6472.44 --> 6479.48
on your own channel he would say those

6474.96 --> 6484.76
things specifically why because sharing

6479.48 --> 6486.44
does not mean upload or

6484.76 --> 6492.2390000000005
copy it

6486.44 --> 6497.4
means copy the link to the

6492.239 --> 6499.239
show like the share button also

6497.4 --> 6502.239
reveals

6499.239 --> 6502.239
yeah

6529.199 --> 6535.159
ah is jge Sanford even still here I

6532.48 --> 6537.598999999999
don't see him oh yeah he's still

6535.159 --> 6540.719
there he's not really been talking for

6537.599 --> 6540.719
eight minutes

6550.0 --> 6555.8
though yeah when I say as I see fit that

6554.239 --> 6560.32
means the

6555.8 --> 6564.159000000001
sharing which means sharing the link to

6560.32 --> 6569.32
the video on any

6564.159 --> 6571.199
platform as in a forum a comment section

6569.32 --> 6575.679
somebody's email

6571.199 --> 6581.5199999999995
group yeah the place where you're going

6575.679 --> 6585.8
to copy the link to my show to can be

6581.52 --> 6589.679
any place you deem fit yeah that means

6585.8 --> 6594.679
the receiving end of the copied link of

6589.679 --> 6598.679
my show can be any place that you think

6594.679 --> 6601.1990000000005
would be receptable to the link of my

6598.679 --> 6604.2390000000005
show yeah that's literally what that

6601.199 --> 6606.638999999999
means that's why I say that literally

6604.239 --> 6609.598999999999
like that every time not differently I

6606.639 --> 6612.76
don't play with it that's exactly how I

6609.599 --> 6615.96
say it and this is what it means and any

6612.76 --> 6621.639
other interpretation is just

6615.96 --> 6624.639
wrong technically wrong and legal

6621.639 --> 6624.639
wrong

6649.04 --> 6652.04
yeah

6678.96 --> 6681.96

continually bicker with them in my

6760.27 --> 6763.359
[Music]

6860.679 --> 6866.52
yourself look like gamas to all of us

6864.079 --> 6866.5199999999995

we can't because we're bickering out ass

6890.48 --> 6897.5199999999995
es who already rejected half of society

6894.4 --> 6899.159
just to hold on to what we see as true

6897.52 --> 6902.679
which is

6899.159 --> 6905.199
true but no we got a bicker all day long

6902.679 --> 6907.4
cuz we're getting bored and then just

6905.199 --> 6910.04
the infighting start for absolutely

6907.4 --> 6912.759999999999
freaking nothing because we're bored it

6910.04 --> 6915.079
just happens you have to think of some

6912.76 --> 6918.159000000001
way to prevent the bickering and the

6915.079 --> 6920.84
infighting from starting again by busy

6918.159 --> 6923.44
therapy talking about a subject I have

6920.84 --> 6927.719
to keep you entertained so you stop

6923.44 --> 6927.719
fighting with one another I mean

6930.44 --> 6934.919999999999
God I don't even know what the hell to

6932.719 --> 6934.92
talk

6935.04 --> 6943.36
about already brought

6938.36 --> 6943.36
up persistent aerosol

6945.04 --> 6951.599
spraying I can bring up

6948.599 --> 6951.599
politics

6952.199 --> 6959.799999999999
there's yeah where is

6955.28 --> 6959.8
this tmania what the

6960.119 --> 6964.639
hell Tasmania is in Australia

6966.48 --> 6969.48
right

6975.92 --> 6982.4
wow okay how

6978.52 --> 6985.2390000000005
bizarre so I just bumped into this

6982.4 --> 6988.679
article where is

6985.239 --> 6991.638999999999
this this is not super well apparently

6988.679 --> 6995.159
in Tasmania there's been giant floods

6991.639 --> 6999.159000000001
biggest floods in 40 years right after

6995.159 --> 6999.159
they started a cloud seeding

6999.88 --> 7005.8
operation this like officially weather

7002.56 --> 7009.96
manipulation attempt and that literally

7005.8 --> 7012.56
created the worst floods in 40 years so

7009.96 --> 7015.8
I guess they overdid it a

7012.56 --> 7018.0
bit because yeah don't [ __ ] around with

7015.8 --> 7018.0
the

7022.32 --> 7025.84
climate so that

7036.159 --> 7041.4
happened the spraying is to keep us warm

7066.96 --> 7075.639
what oh my God m a tet you

7072.199 --> 7078.079
two you're kind of the same age AR just

7075.639 --> 7080.36
be very happy that you don't like go to

7078.079 --> 7082.48
the same school because I bet that you

7080.36 --> 7084.5199999999995
two would always just keep bickering

7082.48 --> 7086.959999999999
about absolutely everything and

7084.52 --> 7091.360000000001
disrupting

7086.96 --> 7091.36
class I just feel you got this

7097.4 --> 7102.638999999999
thing maybe want

7100.159 --> 7105.96
okay thanks for jumping that gun very

7102.639 --> 7108.400000000001
quickly clutch but yeah I was going to

7105.96 --> 7111.28
say like in a few years they'd probably

7108.4 --> 7111.28
be married or

7112.88 --> 7118.639
something she'd been after me

7116.159 --> 7121.759999999999
oh well maybe she thinks that you're

7118.639 --> 7124.92
after her DED ever thought of

7121.76 --> 7130.4800000000005
that I mean when you poke a

7124.92 --> 7134.679
lady they kind of can poke back

7130.48 --> 7136.598999999999
and yeah I mean maybe that's the way

7134.679 --> 7139.88
that you're having a relationship right

7136.599 --> 7139.88
now have considered

7146.32 --> 7152.04
that maybe that's a bit too invasive way

7149.639 --> 7155.0
to view it but I

7152.04 --> 7158.239
mean getting ready for dinner oh

7155.0 --> 7161.239
sorry didn't want to make you sick

7158.239 --> 7161.239
there

7162.84 --> 7166.0
you were talking to zeep

7167.44 --> 7175.678999999999
heavy m i that's just it is freaking

7172.239 --> 7178.4
funny though but I mean that's it is

7175.679 --> 7180.88
just that is just wrong I mean teret is

7178.4 --> 7186.199
definitely

7180.88 --> 7191.2390000000005
not some Indian help desk scam guy

7186.199 --> 7191.239
okay definitely not

7192.84 --> 7196.679
yes teret I heard

7212.44 --> 7218.919999999999
you yes I mean wow is that such a huge

7217.239 --> 7221.28
okay you might have accidentally like

7218.92 --> 7225.2390000000005
really push the racist button there m

7221.28 --> 7225.239
AAL I think he takes

7225.44 --> 7230.28
offense but the teret I'm pretty damn

7228.32 --> 7231.639
sure she was literally just trying to

7230.28 --> 7234.599
make a

7231.639 --> 7237.28
joke I don't actually think that she

7234.599 --> 7240.28
thinks that you're a call center scammer

7237.28 --> 7240.28
guy

7248.119 --> 7251.119
okay

7256.28 --> 7262.04
got his walking stick at all times his

7259.239 --> 7262.04
riot police

7277.199 --> 7284.159
stick if it's find those scammers need

7280.84 --> 7284.159000000001
the stick yes they

7284.92 --> 7291.079
do but terod you know I think also there

7288.88 --> 7293.56
is like another scam I don't even think

7291.079 --> 7295.199
that a lot of these Indian scammers that

7293.56 --> 7297.400000000001
do that I don't think they're even

7295.199 --> 7301.598999999999
Indian I think a lot of them are

7297.4 --> 7304.079
actually like non-indians that pretend

7301.599 --> 7306.4400000000005
to do the Indian voice because doing the

7304.079 --> 7308.799999999999
Indian voice is not that difficult you

7306.44 --> 7311.239
know very different ways that you could

7308.8 --> 7314.0
do that and be very

7311.239 --> 7316.5199999999995
convincing but it's just this thing that

7314.0 --> 7318.8
it's an Indian and then the the scam

7316.52 --> 7321.599
callers just like to do

7318.8 --> 7323.92
that right they don't actually have to

7321.599 --> 7326.28
be Indian so I think there's a lot of

7323.92 --> 7329.28
supposed Indian scammers that probably

7326.28 --> 7333.199
aren't even Indian at

7329.28 --> 7335.599
all really and just for the record no I

7333.199 --> 7338.4
am not one of those pretend Indian

7335.599 --> 7341.719
scammers never have been I just do the

7338.4 --> 7341.719
Indian voice for the fun of

7343.48 --> 7348.32
it correct it could be from yeah yeah

7346.76 --> 7351.4400000000005
that too but I mean that's all the same

7348.32 --> 7352.92
to us ter I mean yeah you're a very big

7351.44 --> 7356.638999999999
country yeah it's very different yeah

7352.92 --> 7359.159
they all the same to us you realize that

7356.639 --> 7361.1990000000005
right I mean people in Europe are not

7359.159 --> 7363.719
going to see the difference between

7361.199 --> 7367.96
somebody from India and

7363.719 --> 7371.679
Pakistan you're all brown short very

7367.96 --> 7375.0
hairy some of them wobbly heads and you

7371.679 --> 7377.4800000000005
all like like this so it's just the same

7375.0 --> 7379.92
to us I mean I mean for you there must

7377.48 --> 7382.679999999999
be a huge difference there but I mean we

7379.92 --> 7385.779
don't see that

7382.68 --> 7385.779
[Music]

7387.28 --> 7391.48
difference sounded like you talked to me

7389.719 --> 7393.079
last

7391.48 --> 7396.5199999999995
[Music]

7393.079 --> 7396.5199999999995
week okie

7397.88 --> 7401.04
dokie

7399.4 --> 7404.239
kind of like a blanket statement saying

7401.04 --> 7404.239
Indian scam yeah it

7413.28 --> 7419.8
is do that voice again and say have you

7417.32 --> 7421.4
been on the

7419.8 --> 7424.04
Hub

7421.4 --> 7426.5199999999995
AUM they probably didn't call you aumu

7424.04 --> 7430.199
virus by the way but hello sir I need to

7426.52 --> 7433.360000000001
call you have you been on the Hub

7430.199 --> 7437.119
there might be a problem with your

7433.36 --> 7441.04
software I need your uh password code so

7437.119 --> 7444.28
I can change the issue and repair

7441.04 --> 7447.679
it please give me your password so I can

7444.28 --> 7450.679
fix it it's very

7447.679 --> 7450.679
reliable

7453.44 --> 7459.28
no I actually had that happen to me one

7456.44 --> 7461.119
time by the way really I was I was in a

7459.28 --> 7464.32
really [ __ ] up place in my I was like

7461.119 --> 7466.88
in panicking mode over other things and

7464.32 --> 7469.719
then I actually bought I almost had my

7466.88 --> 7473.159000000001
computer erased because of that

7469.719 --> 7479.559
[ __ ] I I slowly slip into a Nigerian

7473.159 --> 7479.558999999999
accent overdo the Indian sand oh

7484.719 --> 7491.559
okay I don't know what is Nigerian

7487.92 --> 7495.079
accent Nigerian very different and then

7491.559 --> 7497.04
it becomes Russia I mean weird it just I

7495.079 --> 7499.759999999999
I can try to do these things but I'll

7497.04 --> 7502.4
accidentally have others accents slip in

7499.76 --> 7502.400000000001
there and

7511.84 --> 7517.2390000000005
[ __ ] I guess that when I do an Indian I

7514.84 --> 7519.1990000000005
accidentally turn into a mid African and

7517.239 --> 7522.44
when I do a mid- African I accidentally

7519.199 --> 7522.44
turn into an Eastern

7524.28 --> 7527.84
European and I don't

7538.639 --> 7544.719
know please sir I need you to install

7541.76 --> 7547.4800000000005
any desk or team viewers so we can get

7544.719 --> 7547.4800000000005
access to your

7547.679 --> 7550.679
computer

7552.28 --> 7555.44
hello class your

7558.639 --> 7565.400000000001
bath busting yeah that's cute t I don't

7561.92 --> 7569.04
I don't need to thanks for sharing I I

7565.4 --> 7569.04
don't really I'm not super

7573.88 --> 7581.639
interested scammer rols oh scammer evil

7607.599 --> 7610.599
okay

7631.32 --> 7633.96
all righty

7637.52 --> 7640.52
then

7646.679 --> 7652.559
what the hell are we with talking

7648.96 --> 7654.88
about sometimes my show can be so like

7652.559 --> 7658.0
it'll literally lead you and then like

7654.88 --> 7662.04
where the hell how did I get

7658.0 --> 7664.639
here it's quite elusive like how these

7662.04 --> 7667.0
conversations go sometimes thank God for

7664.639 --> 7670.2390000000005
like the chat memory so I can look back

7667.0 --> 7672.559
like what were we talking about

7670.239 --> 7675.119
again and then unfortunately there's

7672.559 --> 7678.2390000000005
whole segments when you guys don't

7675.119 --> 7680.598999999999
actually talk about anything

7678.239 --> 7683.919999999999
remotely to do with what I'm talking

7680.599 --> 7689.719
about so that doesn't really

7683.92 --> 7689.719
help scatter brain yeah you are akumu

7690.48 --> 7697.44
virus should have gone straight to the

7693.48 --> 7701.32
big boss oh money

7697.44 --> 7701.32
what cluster

7703.96 --> 7708.28
tucked it's the benefit of having no

7706.76 --> 7711.079000000001
structure in your

7708.28 --> 7714.119
show well there's some structure sorry

7711.079 --> 7717.44
zap tappy but there is structure yeah I

7714.119 --> 7720.239
mean look at the first five

7717.44 --> 7724.28
minutes it's so freaking structured it's

7720.239 --> 7727.48
identical like I do the same thing every

7724.28 --> 7731.239
time my intro text is the same the

7727.48 --> 7731.239
procedure is the same I show you the

7733.36 --> 7740.28
weather

7734.88 --> 7740.28
then I say who's first in

7742.639 --> 7750.639
chat then I or whether no first the

7746.48 --> 7756.0
weather then I check the date the

7750.639 --> 7758.159000000001
temperature who's or date who's in chat

7756.0 --> 7760.639
often the temperature well sometimes

7758.159 --> 7763.799999999999
it's a bit mixed the

7760.639 --> 7767.119
order and then I get to a subject often

7763.8 --> 7769.96
starting with referencing what happened

7767.119 --> 7772.558999999999
yesterday I'm very structured but I mean

7769.96 --> 7775.4800000000005
once all that has been

7772.559 --> 7778.4800000000005
done yeah then it can go in any

7775.48 --> 7778.48
direction

7786.28 --> 7791.48
any you are a bit of a noise who are you

7788.92 --> 7791.4800000000005
talking to

7796.84 --> 7804.0
Emma hey Math Man Dr Sam love my show

7801.8 --> 7804.0
thank

7809.88 --> 7815.0
you cool I really appreciate when an

7812.84 --> 7819.8
actual person says

7815.0 --> 7823.8
that oh you're a math guy are

7819.8 --> 7827.4400000000005
you I really are a math guy

7823.8 --> 7830.28
okay oh you better keep that math out of

7827.44 --> 7835.04
my chat that's fine if you want to be in

7830.28 --> 7835.04
math that's cool I am not just so you

7844.84 --> 7850.0
know you're going to have to if you want

7847.96 --> 7853.599
to know know about math then you have to

7850.0 --> 7857.88
go to bra brain's

7853.599 --> 7859.04
logic math is naughty sure I I'm just

7857.88 --> 7861.159000000001
not into

7859.04 --> 7865.36
math it's very

7861.159 --> 7866.48
simple I like to avoid math I like

7865.36 --> 7868.639
verbal

7866.48 --> 7870.44
descriptions cuz when you use verbal

7868.639 --> 7873.0
descriptions now you can

7870.44 --> 7876.119
explain complicated things including

7873.0 --> 7879.36
physics and experiments purely in

7876.119 --> 7883.04
descriptive language without ever having

7879.36 --> 7886.639
to switch to any other type of language

7883.04 --> 7890.8
or expression like for example numbers

7886.639 --> 7893.4400000000005
yeah I prefer to literally lingually

7890.8 --> 7895.719
explain something as a

7893.44 --> 7900.159
whole as a whole

7895.719 --> 7903.599
consistent story sentence

7900.159 --> 7903.598999999999
whatever but that's

7904.48 --> 7909.919999999999
me it's just that hey people that are

7907.599 --> 7913.599
good at math that's pretty cool I'm just

7909.92 --> 7913.599
like I find it personally very

7913.719 --> 7918.599
distractive like in the past too like I

7916.28 --> 7921.159
did get decently well in

7918.599 --> 7922.96
it it's just that there's certain

7921.159 --> 7925.558999999999
barriers and then I felt like I am going

7922.96 --> 7929.119
to have to like break myself just to get

7925.559 --> 7929.119000000001
this and then to remember

7930.119 --> 7935.92
it and then like I'd lose too much too

7934.44 --> 7939.48
much room in my

7935.92 --> 7942.2390000000005
head so I just de prior ized math for

7939.48 --> 7944.48
myself and then yeah I didn't get too

7942.239 --> 7946.44
great at it but I just didn't need to

7944.48 --> 7949.28
it's like never necessary I just figure

7946.44 --> 7952.879999999999
out the patterns I learned sub maath

7949.28 --> 7956.0
like non numerological math basically

7952.88 --> 7957.8
patterns just the pattern of things

7956.0 --> 7960.88
that's something that I have a really

7957.8 --> 7964.639
careful feel for the pattern of things

7960.88 --> 7964.639
but pattern of things is not

7965.36 --> 7972.04
math it's not non- numerological

7969.159 --> 7975.159
it's just structures

7972.04 --> 7978.599
ratios that sort of thing

7975.159 --> 7982.759999999999
ratios consecutive actions that sort of

7978.599 --> 7982.76
thing right patterns

7986.76 --> 7993.4400000000005
programs and that part I am very focused

7990.28 --> 7994.8
on but as soon as numbers get involved

7993.44 --> 7996.96
things get

7994.8 --> 7999.96
reified and

7996.96 --> 7999.96
distracted

8000.239 --> 8003.799999999999
right but hey if you're good at it

8002.239 --> 8008.119
that's

8003.8 --> 8008.119000000001
cool math man do

8026.96 --> 8029.96
Sam

8038.76 --> 8045.4400000000005
what what does that even mean akumu

8041.0 --> 8047.52
virus don't remember Y 2 + 2 = 4

8045.44 --> 8050.799999999999
understand why what's the difference

8047.52 --> 8053.76
between remembering Y 2 + 2 = 4 and

8050.8 --> 8059.18
understanding Y 2 + 2 equals

8053.76 --> 8062.249
4 it literally has the same aners

8059.18 --> 8062.249000000001
[Music]

8086.679 --> 8091.719
don't remember yeah you don't remember

8088.719 --> 8096.599
no that but You' rephrased it wrong

8091.719 --> 8099.159
don't remember that 2 + 2 = 4 understand

8096.599 --> 8103.04
why but you said don't remember why 2 +

8099.159 --> 8105.92
2 equal 4 well why it is like that is

8103.04 --> 8107.84
the same as understanding why it is like

8105.92 --> 8110.36
that yeah remembering why and

8107.84 --> 8114.04
understanding why have the same answer

8110.36 --> 8114.04
so you formulated that very

8116.8 --> 8119.8
clumsily

8136.239 --> 8146.04
crab keeper oh yes you accidentally

8139.48 --> 8150.32
typed in the w i key I get it the y key

8146.04 --> 8150.32
you accidentally pressed it I get it AUM

8151.4 --> 8155.0
virus sure you

8166.119 --> 8171.199
did it's a swipe yes I know because the

8169.28 --> 8174.88
W the

8171.199 --> 8176.638999999999
H and the Y they're all so close to one

8174.88 --> 8179.079
another on the keyboard so yeah of

8176.639 --> 8181.400000000001
course that accidentally just the Y just

8179.079 --> 8185.159
accidentally got randomly pushed there

8181.4 --> 8185.159
it makes perfect sense AUM

8196.92 --> 8203.519
virus you did a typo with the Y earlier

8200.599 --> 8206.0
trying to say way yeah that yeah that is

8203.519 --> 8206.0
a fair

8206.679 --> 8211.719000000001
enough

8209.319 --> 8214.679
but I mean akum virus just said it to

8211.719 --> 8217.08
try to explain it like he accidentally

8214.679 --> 8222.28
typed in why like he just pressed the

8217.08 --> 8224.24
key and w h y just appeared in between

8222.28 --> 8227.0
the sentence accidentally I mean that's

8224.24 --> 8229.039999999999
not exactly how a typo Works a gumu

8227.0 --> 8232.04
virus but

8229.04 --> 8232.04
uh

8236.04 --> 8242.28
yeah try wel with the DD f l l

8245.679 --> 8252.960000000001
what

8248.0 --> 8252.96
okay I don't know much about Welsh low

8253.12 --> 8260.28
fruit France is closer to England than

8256.559 --> 8263.279999999999
Ireland what is

8260.28 --> 8263.28
it

8266.599 --> 8269.599
really

8293.28 --> 8296.28
huh

8296.519 --> 8299.519
h

8301.399 --> 8305.319
okay that's interest I never realized

8303.08 --> 8307.12
that I thought it was like the closest

8305.319 --> 8309.359
point to the mainland I didn't know it

8307.12 --> 8312.359
was even closer than Ireland was to

8309.359 --> 8312.359
England

8312.76 --> 8319.12
huh cuz I always thought that iron was

8315.439 --> 8322.519
like pretty much right next to

8319.12 --> 8322.519
England I guess

8326.04 --> 8329.519
not h

8349.439 --> 8354.960000000001
wow that's like a chaos playground out

8352.76 --> 8358.319
it looks like a big

8354.96 --> 8362.0
sandbox kids have been [ __ ] around

8358.319 --> 8365.719
with and just like BR lines and a mess I

8362.0 --> 8369.439
mean the sky looks like a complete

8365.719 --> 8373.759999999998
mess look at this it's just what kind of

8369.439 --> 8373.76
a it's just a giant

8386.439 --> 8389.439
mess

8401.42 --> 8404.629

vro God damn

8444.68 --> 8452.08
it I could never say that fluid

8449.2 --> 8454.560000000001
though it kind of sounds like

8452.08 --> 8459.56
Elish but holy

8454.56 --> 8459.56
[ __ ] not bad cool I'm glad I got

8460.16 --> 8466.479
close I mean I have this weird thing I'm

8463.0 --> 8469.12
not like I don't really understand

8466.479 --> 8471.56
languages but one thing I tend to get

8469.12 --> 8474.76
really well and that is like the

8471.56 --> 8477.399
pronunciation like ways it sounds ways

8474.76 --> 8480.84
things are pronounced I tend to like get

8477.399 --> 8482.599999999999
that part really well so for example I

8480.84 --> 8486.439
can read out

8482.6 --> 8489.28
Spanish and say it like really like

8486.439 --> 8491.439
Spanish even though I might literally

8489.28 --> 8495.12
not completely understand what it even

8491.439 --> 8498.64
is like what it is saying I'll say it

8495.12 --> 8501.08
Spanish because I know how Spanish

8498.64 --> 8502.72
Works

8501.08 --> 8506.359
phonetically

8502.72 --> 8509.84
see I can read Spanish and say it

8506.359 --> 8512.0
properly in Spanish even though I'm not

8509.84 --> 8515.2
understanding what it is that it

8512.0 --> 8517.84
means that's how I work I can say I can

8515.2 --> 8522.2
speak languages often and say it their

8517.84 --> 8522.2
way without actually understanding

8522.88 --> 8529.679999999998
it because I have this like parrot type

8526.72 --> 8532.319
memory for sound I have a very strong

8529.68 --> 8534.439
phonetic memory I inherited that from my

8532.319 --> 8537.319
mother who was even better at

8534.439 --> 8541.6
it and with me it resulted in like this

8537.319 --> 8544.96
parability I can like phonetically copy

8541.6 --> 8548.76
things and then like I'll not just copy

8544.96 --> 8551.199999999999
the words no I'll copy the exact

8548.76 --> 8554.72
combination of tone Heights that were

8551.2 --> 8557.960000000001
used in a very memy thing that was that

8554.72 --> 8562.399
I'll memorize the exact tone

8557.96 --> 8564.08
Heights like a sampling copy machine

8562.399 --> 8566.92
that's how I

8564.08 --> 8571.24
work I can like literally like a copy

8566.92 --> 8571.24
play ler copy a

8575.12 --> 8581.2
sound like the way it

8578.359 --> 8583.28
sounds it's like somebody could remember

8581.2 --> 8586.240000000002
oh he said that thing that's so famous

8583.28 --> 8589.92
or so typical and they all remember what

8586.24 --> 8593.52
he said but I remember exactly how they

8589.92 --> 8594.52
said it and I can then mimic how they

8593.52 --> 8597.439
said

8594.52 --> 8600.800000000001
it I have just this special memory for

8597.439 --> 8600.800000000001
that it is like parrot

8601.6 --> 8606.2
memory phonetic memory very

8611.479 --> 8615.8
specific I guess I'd be pretty good at

8614.0 --> 8617.399
that game what is it again that the

8615.8 --> 8619.88
sound

8617.399 --> 8622.278999999999
game where what is it called again it's

8619.88 --> 8624.839999999998
the old like' 70s

8622.279 --> 8625.76
game where we had like different colors

8624.84 --> 8629.64
and

8625.76 --> 8632.04
sounds and then then like you memorize

8629.64 --> 8634.88
the sound and and light pattern right

8632.04 --> 8637.279
I'm probably really good at that

8634.88 --> 8640.24
naturally because I have a very strong

8637.279 --> 8643.319000000001
fanatic memory I have a better fanatic

8640.24 --> 8643.319
memory than a visual

8644.76 --> 8649.12
memory and I have a pretty good visual

8650.24 --> 8654.479
memory I'm like a per yeah thanks

8656.0 --> 8659.0
aty

8661.64 --> 8666.64
Villa yeah

8663.64 --> 8666.64
V

8668.359 --> 8673.399000000001
via in France two L's

8673.76 --> 8680.479
are yeah it's J's the L are basically

8677.84 --> 8680.479
pronounced as

8685.96 --> 8691.96
J's

8688.92 --> 8694.319
it's not V it's

8691.96 --> 8698.039999999999
V there

8694.319 --> 8702.0
the is more pronounced in between the I

8698.04 --> 8706.720000000001
and the a so it's not VI it's

8702.0 --> 8710.92
VI there's soft in there

8706.72 --> 8710.92
JS that's how the dou L is

8711.16 --> 8714.16
used

8715.479 --> 8719.399
yanir right

8717.6 --> 8722.279
so that's the Russian way of by the way

8719.399 --> 8724.599999999999
using the L Uh Russian the French way of

8722.279 --> 8724.6
using

8724.72 --> 8728.199999999999
it right a

8728.56 --> 8734.278999999999
girl f i l l

8732.439 --> 8736.84
e a

8734.279 --> 8738.68
girl

8736.84 --> 8743.319
F or

8738.68 --> 8745.0
Philly in like slang English little

8743.319 --> 8747.84
Philly that's where it comes from that's

8745.0 --> 8749.76
literally the French word f which means

8747.84 --> 8753.479
girl or

8749.76 --> 8753.479
woman now it means

8765.359 --> 8771.399000000001
girl as an arrogant American maybe I'm

8769.2 --> 8773.68
simply not interested enough in learning

8771.399 --> 8778.8
another language I know a little Spanish

8773.68 --> 8778.800000000001
but never go too far learning it

8778.88 --> 8784.96
yeah well same for me I learned a little

8781.479 --> 8788.278999999999
bit of Spanish because well I was I went

8784.96 --> 8791.039999999999
on vacation to Spain most of my youth my

8788.279 --> 8793.92
parents always went to the same region

8791.04 --> 8796.880000000001
but the problem was I ended up more

8793.92 --> 8801.479
talking span English English with a

8796.88 --> 8804.839999999998
Spanish accent with the other Spanish

8801.479 --> 8807.119999999999
kids because they were learning

8804.84 --> 8810.24
English and were not very good good at

8807.12 --> 8812.6
it I was very good at English So

8810.24 --> 8814.84
eventually I just didn't learn Spanish

8812.6 --> 8817.640000000001
anymore because I would just always talk

8814.84 --> 8819.439
English and communicate much more easily

8817.64 --> 8822.278999999999
that

8819.439 --> 8824.12
way so yeah it's just the English got in

8822.279 --> 8827.359
the

8824.12 --> 8830.439
way but when I especially pre-teen I did

8827.359 --> 8832.84
learn just through my parents my parents

8830.439 --> 8835.2
taught me like a little bit of

8832.84 --> 8837.56
Spanish and that was

8835.2 --> 8841.0
interesting but event I just started

8837.56 --> 8843.68
talking English and yeah then the span

8841.0 --> 8846.64
when you talk English like half the

8843.68 --> 8849.319
Spanish people or the people in Spain

8846.64 --> 8852.56
specifically like half of them would at

8849.319 --> 8855.64
least list be able to understand English

8852.56 --> 8857.76
not always talk it I mean the newer

8855.64 --> 8860.519999999999
Generations are probably much better at

8857.76 --> 8864.359
it cuz I was dealing like with that in

8860.52 --> 8867.12
the '90s right ' 80s and '90s it's kind

8864.359 --> 8869.279
of a different time now probably many

8867.12 --> 8871.800000000001
more Spanish people talk English

8869.279 --> 8874.84
compared to back

8871.8 --> 8879.519999999999
then cuz back then it was really still

8874.84 --> 8881.67
more uh a farming and uh what do you

8879.52 --> 8883.84
call

8881.67 --> 8887.12
[Music]

8883.84 --> 8890.16
that what's the word for

8887.12 --> 8893.92
that tourist is what more farming and

8890.16 --> 8898.2
tourist industry oriented but so much

8893.92 --> 8900.960000000001
has changed since then blatantly

8898.2 --> 8906.84
right all European stuff really

8900.96 --> 8906.839999999998
rearrange Spain and it's just different

8907.479 --> 8912.92
now less focused on tourism and and

8920.76 --> 8925.6
farming if you have no password there's

8923.479 --> 8928.599999999999
not much use in learning another

8925.6 --> 8928.6
language

8929.72 --> 8935.92
that all depends on how well you are at

8933.359 --> 8935.92
learning

8937.439 --> 8942.2
languages Maria in Spain oh

8942.84 --> 8950.04
okay well we went to pulse p a LS which

8947.76 --> 8952.76
is like Northeast of

8950.04 --> 8954.960000000001
Barcelona on the East Northeast Coast

8952.76 --> 8959.08
that's where we went a

8954.96 --> 8962.839999999998
lot or like every single time I haven't

8959.08 --> 8962.84
been there in over a decade

8967.72 --> 8971.88
though nice and warm yeah that was too

8970.319 --> 8975.8
hot for us

8971.88 --> 8978.92
there I mean South Spain is just is

8975.8 --> 8982.438999999998
really freaking hot in the

8978.92 --> 8984.68
summer I mean during the winter it's

8982.439 --> 8987.04
actually kind of nice nice South Spain

8984.68 --> 8988.960000000001
it's not terrible it's still like like

8987.04 --> 8992.68
decently warm and

8988.96 --> 8995.519999999999
[ __ ] not super cold or more Inland it's

8992.68 --> 8998.76
more cold but at the coast not so

8995.52 --> 9003.6
much but I mean in the in Midsummer I

8998.76 --> 9006.52
don't want to be like South Spain at all

9003.6 --> 9009.68
or mid Spain because you literally fry

9006.52 --> 9012.04
there on if you freaking pass out on the

9009.68 --> 9015.64
street in mid

9012.04 --> 9017.359
Spain and like nobody finds you you'll

9015.64 --> 9019.56
freaking die

9017.359 --> 9022.439
if you pass out in the street in

9019.56 --> 9025.24
Midsummer in Spain in one of the big

9022.439 --> 9028.479000000001
cities and nobody spots you you'll die

9025.24 --> 9031.439
you'll literally like die getting Fried

9028.479 --> 9033.92
by the sun on the spot getting cooked in

9031.439 --> 9036.16
the street it's that freaking hot it's

9033.92 --> 9036.16
not

9042.88 --> 9047.72
funny so yeah we mostly stuck to the

9045.96 --> 9049.96
Northeast East Coast where it would

9047.72 --> 9053.399
still be plenty warm but you wouldn't

9049.96 --> 9056.599999999999
get cooked as

9053.399 --> 9059.278999999999
much you wouldn't have like heat mirages

9056.6 --> 9061.24
everywhere right it would just be just

9059.279 --> 9065.479000000001
nice and warm nice and

9061.24 --> 9065.479
sunny but not too freaking

9075.359 --> 9078.359
hot

9081.12 --> 9085.76
to Barcelona a lot cool well Barcelona

9084.08 --> 9087.439
is a really beautiful city and it has

9085.76 --> 9089.800000000001
this Sada

9087.439 --> 9091.720000000001
Familia like all the other gudy

9089.8 --> 9094.92
buildings and the gudy park it's

9091.72 --> 9098.278999999999
freaking amazing I love that place I've

9094.92 --> 9101.84
seen the gudy park

9098.279 --> 9105.399000000001
develop like there's a lot more things

9101.84 --> 9108.479
there now than there was when I first

9105.399 --> 9111.0
came there and the sagada Familia too I

9108.479 --> 9113.119999999999
mean when I was there the first time saw

9111.0 --> 9115.439
the sagada Familia they hadn't they

9113.12 --> 9117.84
still had only the bricked part which

9115.439 --> 9120.880000000001
was basically like four towers and a

9117.84 --> 9125.0
piece of the the

9120.88 --> 9127.64
main thing and the entrance but like

9125.0 --> 9130.2
since then they like almost completed it

9127.64 --> 9133.119999999999
like they built all the other Towers

9130.2 --> 9137.08
they got all the domes in there oh and

9133.12 --> 9139.880000000001
by the way yeah I freaking guarantee you

9137.08 --> 9141.92
that's not concrete that's geopolymer

9139.88 --> 9144.679999999998
that they are using

9141.92 --> 9146.24
okay they're using geopolymer for that

9144.68 --> 9148.52
and it's good on them because they'll

9146.24 --> 9148.52
need

9149.52 --> 9153.2
it yeah you're not going to build a

9151.68 --> 9156.64
church out of

9153.2 --> 9158.359
concrete they used cast geopolymer I

9156.64 --> 9160.119999999999
didn't know what it was it just kind of

9158.359 --> 9161.960000000001
looks like it could be concrete but it

9160.12 --> 9165.0
isn't it's

9161.96 --> 9168.519999999999
geopolymer that's how they are now like

9165.0 --> 9168.52
pretty rapidly building this

9168.72 --> 9175.438999999998
thing Barcelona for football oh

9172.64 --> 9178.519999999999
goody yeah that's there too I

9175.439 --> 9181.16
guess I never went to Barcelona for

9178.52 --> 9181.16
football

9195.16 --> 9198.16
though

9203.24 --> 9207.119999999999
right for the Americans in here we're

9205.319 --> 9210.199999999999
talking about

9207.12 --> 9213.68
soccer you call it gy buildings are

9210.2 --> 9216.359
really cool yeah I know gy was like a

9213.68 --> 9218.08
real inspiration for me for a long time

9216.359 --> 9220.24
made me want to become an

9218.08 --> 9222.319
architect but it never really went

9220.24 --> 9224.92
anywhere with that but I mean I'm really

9222.319 --> 9228.16
inspired by his shapes and like what he

9224.92 --> 9228.16
does I find it very f

9230.84 --> 9235.960000000001
fascinating I have a really great book

9233.08 --> 9239.279
of AI but I don't think it's here in

9235.96 --> 9240.839999999998
this house like a really large book with

9239.279 --> 9243.880000000001
like very

9240.84 --> 9245.359
big sketches like the sketches that he

9243.88 --> 9247.759999999998
made and

9245.359 --> 9251.640000000001
photographs amazing

9247.76 --> 9254.2
stuff like the gouty

9251.64 --> 9258.08
book was kind of expensive too at the

9254.2 --> 9258.08
time but so worth it

9258.76 --> 9263.800000000001
all right anyway I'm taking a two minute

9260.76 --> 9267.880000000001
break I'll be right back after

9263.8 --> 9267.88
that hope you all enjoying the

9285.08 --> 9288.08
show

9315.0 --> 9318.0
what

9374.92 --> 9377.92
for

9391.24 --> 9393.68
and I'm

9394.64 --> 9397.64
back

9404.88 --> 9407.88
what

9415.84 --> 9418.72
what the [ __ ] low

9434.8 --> 9437.8
fruit

9439.24 --> 9443.479
L why the hell would you do

9445.359 --> 9450.04
that why the [ __ ] would you even

9452.96 --> 9460.278999999999
why he is Irish that doesn't like why

9456.56 --> 9464.72
the [ __ ] did he have your stuff with him

9460.279 --> 9464.720000000001
when he's going to the

9464.8 --> 9467.8
why

9473.08 --> 9480.88
yeah and ICM in my handbag hilarious m

9477.319 --> 9480.88
appeal it's one hell of a

9488.279 --> 9494.399000000001
handbag you collected

9490.84 --> 9497.0
stuff what he didn't look he hadn't

9494.399 --> 9497.84
actually opened the back to see what was

9497.0 --> 9500.84
in

9497.84 --> 9500.84
it

9509.84 --> 9516.0
really oh I guess he just didn't think

9512.359 --> 9519.52
of it h but the [ __ ]

9516.0 --> 9523.64
dude it's just in your

9519.52 --> 9525.880000000001
bag just a child of 50

9523.64 --> 9529.439
right okay well I guess that's just just

9525.88 --> 9529.438999999998
a mistake you're going to make one

9532.68 --> 9538.2
time although I don't know what the hell

9534.96 --> 9542.759999999998
you're doing with a replica gun at 15

9538.2 --> 9548.240000000002
yeah I did not have a replica gun at

9542.76 --> 9548.24
15 I mean I was making crossbows in

9548.52 --> 9554.359
school but I did not have a replica gun

9552.04 --> 9554.359
or

9554.64 --> 9557.64
whatever

9562.04 --> 9566.92
yeah I actually made a crossbow out of a

9564.479 --> 9570.039999999999
so an iron ruler right so one of those

9566.92 --> 9572.88
steel rulers that are flexible I made a

9570.04 --> 9572.880000000001
crossbow out of

9576.84 --> 9582.0
it right but at least when you have a

9579.6 --> 9584.640000000001
thing like that that's like they don't

9582.0 --> 9587.2
care about

9584.64 --> 9590.039999999999
that when they find that's just like oh

9587.2 --> 9590.04
it's just a piece of

9595.04 --> 9601.04
junk Canada Farm kids all have guns

9598.439 --> 9604.279
while okay but that's in the farm George

9601.04 --> 9604.279
Sanford that's

9605.0 --> 9611.52
different Farm kids don't go on airplane

9608.92 --> 9614.56
trips to other countries on a regular

9611.52 --> 9617.560000000001
basis if you know what I

9614.56 --> 9617.56
mean

9618.359 --> 9624.12
the toy gun yeah I'm a but I mean toy

9621.88 --> 9626.96
gun as in like those

9624.12 --> 9628.84
transparent plastic little water guns or

9626.96 --> 9630.919999999998
something yeah but that's literally

9628.84 --> 9633.76
never going to be mistaken for a real

9630.92 --> 9636.84
weapon yeah that's not a replica gun a

9633.76 --> 9640.24
replica guns are like the props that are

9636.84 --> 9642.279
used for movies right to make it look

9640.24 --> 9645.319
like real

9642.279 --> 9648.6
guns but those are like illegal because

9645.319 --> 9650.72
those those types of guns get used in

9648.6 --> 9654.439
robberies fake

9650.72 --> 9656.84
guns looks really real can be used like

9654.439 --> 9658.720000000001
it's really real when people see it

9656.84 --> 9659.6
they're not going to resist like if it

9658.72 --> 9663.479
were

9659.6 --> 9663.479000000001
real so they're IL

9663.84 --> 9668.439
legal like you can't just bring that in

9666.279 --> 9668.439
the

9674.439 --> 9678.720000000001
airport

9676.359 --> 9681.279
like unless you like put them into a

9678.72 --> 9683.479
lock box and you like reported as like

9681.279 --> 9684.960000000001
these are replica guns we're using them

9683.479 --> 9690.479
for movie or

9684.96 --> 9690.479
whatever right you can't just sneak that

9691.92 --> 9698.68
on so them in Spain yeah I guess well in

9696.52 --> 9702.439
Spain the the rules are slightly more

9698.68 --> 9702.439
loose about such

9704.439 --> 9707.439
things

9720.88 --> 9727.64
what about in pieces in a different bag

9724.52 --> 9732.319000000001
yeah that no that that would probably

9727.64 --> 9732.319
pass through akumu virus I mean if it's

9733.479 --> 9737.479
disassembled it wouldn't be Rec recogniz

9735.92 --> 9740.52
as

9737.479 --> 9742.76
such especially if you just put it like

9740.52 --> 9745.84
in the bag with other

9742.76 --> 9750.0
stuff but if you have it in a special

9745.84 --> 9752.319
box that's meant to like put the parts

9750.0 --> 9756.12
of a disassembled gun into yeah then

9752.319 --> 9756.119999999999
they will definitely recognize

9764.359 --> 9767.359
it

9768.08 --> 9774.52
you can get guns in Liverpool really

9770.76 --> 9774.52
what the [ __ ]

9789.75 --> 9792.899
[Music]

9794.279 --> 9797.279
okay

9810.479 --> 9814.479
how did the conversation roll into

9820.72 --> 9825.88
this we're talking about

9824.279 --> 9830.76
languages

9825.88 --> 9833.839999999998
Spain East Spain vacations and then

9830.76 --> 9838.56
suddenly low fruit brought

9833.84 --> 9840.6
up a replica gun that he gave us yeah

9838.56 --> 9842.72
that he got his dad got caught with at

9840.6 --> 9842.720000000001
the

9843.76 --> 9846.76
airport

9854.2 --> 9857.2
y

9914.08 --> 9917.08
for

9944.08 --> 9949.96
e

9946.96 --> 9951.96
H yeah L Fred I mean I've done a couple

9949.96 --> 9953.479
of like messed up things like that when

9951.96 --> 9956.358999999999
I was

9953.479 --> 9958.8
younger I mean I was also like obsessed

9956.359 --> 9962.16
with weapons and

9958.8 --> 9966.64
stuff but I never like went too far with

9962.16 --> 9966.64
it I'd just be like clumsy and

9970.16 --> 9975.399
thoughtless but I've like never been I

9973.0 --> 9978.6
never like took a knife with me to

9975.399 --> 9978.599999999999
school or something like

9982.88 --> 9990.24
that as an adventurous kid yeah me too a

9986.319 --> 9993.08
lot like I would be very eager to risk

9990.24 --> 9996.039999999999
getting in trouble just for adventure I

9993.08 --> 9996.039999999999
took that very

9998.64 --> 10003.439
far did more like a don't say such

10004.0 --> 10007.0
things

10008.37 --> 10012.049
[Music]

10018.84 --> 10024.68
girls can be adventurous

10021.24 --> 10026.16
too it's just a type I know the type

10024.68 --> 10028.6
they always say oh I'm just like the

10026.16 --> 10033.039999999999
boys like no you're not you just like

10028.6 --> 10033.04
the hang around the boys you like the

10033.92 --> 10036.92
action

10038.76 --> 10045.16
like my friend from is also a woman like

10042.6 --> 10045.16
that

10047.76 --> 10051.960000000001
always like she doesn't like to hang

10050.2 --> 10055.2
around other

10051.96 --> 10057.96
women cuz they always start getting like

10055.2 --> 10060.560000000001
gamma bickering and then just

10057.96 --> 10063.16
like dissing on her because they're like

10060.56 --> 10065.6
jealous in some

10063.16 --> 10068.76
way well those types of women always end

10065.6 --> 10068.76
up hanging around

10072.16 --> 10080.439
men until about 12 then I went girly oh

10076.16 --> 10084.08
okay well get some women then don't do

10080.439 --> 10087.720000000001
that they don't really go girly too much

10084.08 --> 10087.72
well they might be a bit

10093.8 --> 10096.8
but

10098.52 --> 10103.0
my best friend I would take off running

10100.76 --> 10106.6
when we saw police car hoping they would

10103.0 --> 10110.12
chase us

10106.6 --> 10112.399000000001
wow wow that's hilarious though blue

10110.12 --> 10112.399000000001
build

10123.8 --> 10126.8
evolution

10143.64 --> 10148.08
feels good to be wanted even by the

10146.0 --> 10150.64
police I guess that's L of the dumbest

10148.08 --> 10153.88
thing I've ever heard to say

10150.64 --> 10156.199999999999
AUM no it's not no it isn't it's the

10153.88 --> 10158.679999999998
dumbest thing you said today though

10156.2 --> 10161.439
Akuma virus

10158.68 --> 10163.479000000001
[ __ ] no it's not good to be wanted by

10161.439 --> 10166.479000000001
the police you dumb

10163.479 --> 10166.479
ass

10168.84 --> 10175.64
[ __ ] it's just a Thrills the Thrills the

10173.0 --> 10175.64
run the

10181.12 --> 10185.960000000001
chase yeah but I get it I was like that

10183.96 --> 10189.239
but not when I was 12

10185.96 --> 10193.0
though like I was like that up

10189.239 --> 10195.239
until like 11 and then I really stopped

10193.0 --> 10197.84
doing

10195.239 --> 10201.0
that I became more

10197.84 --> 10202.92
nerdy I became more distant from friends

10201.0 --> 10205.68
in general because they all started to

10202.92 --> 10208.08
act like [ __ ] they all suddenly got

10205.68 --> 10210.64
like oh I'm I'm a man now all of a

10208.08 --> 10212.76
sudden and then they all had to like be

10210.64 --> 10214.72
pushy against me because I made them

10212.76 --> 10217.0
feel uncertain about their manlihood

10214.72 --> 10220.479
because I was so [ __ ]

10217.0 --> 10222.8
smart not particularly wise but I was

10220.479 --> 10222.8
[ __ ]

10224.68 --> 10230.479000000001
smart and so after that I kind of became

10227.96 --> 10230.479
more of a

10231.279 --> 10236.880000000001
loner I had friends like school friends

10234.88 --> 10239.319
that I would hang around after that time

10236.88 --> 10242.519999999999
but they were mostly

10239.319 --> 10245.88
nerds I realized like hey I'm a nerd I

10242.52 --> 10247.720000000001
like computer game stuff I like talking

10245.88 --> 10250.0
about computer game stuff I like

10247.72 --> 10252.319
designing computer game stuff I like

10250.0 --> 10255.47
talking with guys that are into computer

10252.319 --> 10257.199999999999
game stuff I'm a

10255.47 --> 10260.358999999999
[Music]

10257.2 --> 10261.640000000001
nerd I mean I got a giant thrill out of

10260.359 --> 10266.76
going to

10261.64 --> 10270.278999999999
the HCC days which would literally be

10266.76 --> 10273.479
like super geeky glass wearing nerds

10270.279 --> 10275.319000000001
that are Mega awkward can barely talk of

10273.479 --> 10278.84
between like

10275.319 --> 10280.8
12 and and 20 or something there were

10278.84 --> 10282.52
like hundreds of them would come

10280.8 --> 10285.96
together in this giant

10282.52 --> 10288.84
hle and then exchange video games on

10285.96 --> 10291.278999999999
like every computer they had for like

10288.84 --> 10292.479
their Schneider in Commodore 64 to like

10291.279 --> 10296.239
their Amiga

10292.479 --> 10299.479
1200 or PC or whatever and then like I

10296.239 --> 10302.6
was thrilled I got like a huge kick out

10299.479 --> 10305.08
of that I mean only a nerd would get a

10302.6 --> 10307.76
huge kick out of being surrounded by

10305.08 --> 10310.96
hundreds and hundreds of glass wearing

10307.76 --> 10314.319
super awkward video game nerds

10310.96 --> 10314.319
okay I'm a

10314.6 --> 10321.52
nerd I just happen to be a ner that's

10317.64 --> 10323.479
really not good well avoidant of math

10321.52 --> 10327.319000000001
not a

10323.479 --> 10327.319
programmer doesn't look

10329.68 --> 10336.479000000001
ugly so I'm just really weird I

10333.479 --> 10336.479
guess

10353.319 --> 10358.08
oh yeah fluent talker that's definitely

10355.72 --> 10361.16
not nerd material nerds are not fluent

10358.08 --> 10363.72
talkers I mean they might ramble

10361.16 --> 10366.08
on but I mean if you're a fluent talker

10363.72 --> 10368.88
you're already like moving away from

10366.08 --> 10371.52
actually being conceived of as a

10368.88 --> 10373.679999999998
nerd even if you do like playing video

10371.52 --> 10376.319000000001
games if you're a good talker they don't

10373.68 --> 10376.319
see you like

10377.2 --> 10383.279
that but I wasn't as good when I was a

10379.68 --> 10387.319
teenager and all that I wasn't this

10383.279 --> 10389.960000000001
good so yeah I was a real nerd my first

10387.319 --> 10393.68
friend was the

10389.96 --> 10396.358999999999
Amiga no wasn't commodor was my first

10393.68 --> 10396.359
friend

10400.439 --> 10405.68
and it's even like I my parents kind of

10402.84 --> 10409.52
try to push me around a bit to like hey

10405.68 --> 10411.880000000001
maybe I should like find

10409.52 --> 10414.960000000001
friends instead of just playing on their

10411.88 --> 10414.96
video games all the

10416.319 --> 10420.76
time nerd thck

10421.76 --> 10426.359
skater

10423.359 --> 10426.359
okay

10429.439 --> 10434.319
I think they just call that a dark akumo

10449.2 --> 10455.0
virus what's the difference between a

10451.439 --> 10457.399
nerd and a geek Jesus

10455.0 --> 10457.399
I don't

10461.399 --> 10467.519999999999
know I think uh dor it is

10470.479 --> 10477.16
yeah a nerd I think is somebody that's

10475.319 --> 10481.239
hyperfocused like

10477.16 --> 10483.96
on these types of nerdy things a geek is

10481.239 --> 10486.399
just somebody that's weird and doesn't

10483.96 --> 10489.88
really fit in they're awkward

10486.399 --> 10493.039999999999
specifically awkward not in a computer

10489.88 --> 10496.319
like way where a nerd is like they're

10493.04 --> 10498.68
not interested in Social relationships

10496.319 --> 10501.0
they're more interested in their

10498.68 --> 10503.64
computer and they know things about it

10501.0 --> 10506.84
and they probably learn programming

10503.64 --> 10509.479
Etc because if you're just a video gamer

10506.84 --> 10509.479
you're not a

10510.279 --> 10516.6
nerd yeah so a lot of times nerds are

10513.439 --> 10518.56
like decently intelligent and they're

10516.6 --> 10520.960000000001
like better at technical things than

10518.56 --> 10522.16
they are at Social things and then they

10520.96 --> 10526.88
end up a

10522.16 --> 10529.96
nerd a geek doesn't have to be a

10526.88 --> 10533.199999999999
nerd like a geek is just can be like a

10529.96 --> 10535.278999999999
goofy person a geek doesn't even have to

10533.2 --> 10538.279
be

10535.279 --> 10542.2
smart I

10538.279 --> 10546.479000000001
think hold on I might be getting it

10542.2 --> 10548.84
wrong yeah geek fandom nerd int right

10546.479 --> 10550.519999999999
that that's how I understood it like a

10548.84 --> 10552.439
geek doesn't necessarily even have to be

10550.52 --> 10553.399000000001
smart if you're not smart then you can't

10552.439 --> 10556.279
be a

10553.399 --> 10558.16
nerd doesn't work you're just a failed

10556.279 --> 10560.960000000001
nerd then it's like you're going to move

10558.16 --> 10560.96
on to something

10564.239 --> 10568.279
else a geek can be totally thick yes

10567.12 --> 10573.12
they're just

10568.279 --> 10577.279
awkward and like oh he's such a geek oh

10573.12 --> 10577.279
he has to be different oh he's so

10579.04 --> 10586.76
special like Goths and Emos can

10584.52 --> 10591.2
definitely be

10586.76 --> 10591.2
Geeks but a lot of the times they are't

10592.479 --> 10597.76
nerds although they do there are gothic

10599.12 --> 10606.08
nerds I didn't meet them

10603.08 --> 10606.08
right

10606.16 --> 10611.479
did mun stay in the chat long I think

10608.439 --> 10615.0
he's still here but he just moved on a

10611.479 --> 10615.0
nerd can still be good

10616.479 --> 10622.88
socially well yeah but often they have

10620.6 --> 10626.359
to make more effort for it so they have

10622.88 --> 10627.56
to really work on being more presentable

10626.359 --> 10630.76
more

10627.56 --> 10633.72
acceptable more sociable right that's

10630.76 --> 10635.880000000001
the difference like a nerd is just often

10633.72 --> 10639.119999999999
really good at like the computer the

10635.88 --> 10641.0
programming at getting things about it

10639.12 --> 10642.880000000001
but then like they have to make a little

10641.0 --> 10645.0
bit more extra effort they like have to

10642.88 --> 10647.0
make it like they're not sweating over

10645.0 --> 10649.319
oh it's the computer program working did

10647.0 --> 10651.52
my did my system work now they're like

10649.319 --> 10652.88
oh oh [ __ ] am I going to be presentable

10651.52 --> 10655.560000000001
enough

10652.88 --> 10657.399
right or they literally don't worry

10655.56 --> 10660.8
about that at all and that is why they

10657.399 --> 10662.72
are so nerdy because they just

10660.8 --> 10664.84
completely forget about oh yeah I

10662.72 --> 10666.399
actually had to put on a suit this time

10664.84 --> 10668.64
I have to be presentable they just

10666.399 --> 10671.72
forget it's like yeah I was just focused

10668.64 --> 10675.519999999999
on the program like uh you're supposed

10671.72 --> 10675.519999999999
to be dressed nicely

10676.2 --> 10682.479000000001
today that's also

10679.12 --> 10687.439
nerd nerds tend to forget more about

10682.479 --> 10687.438999999998
social things be more sloppy in that

10692.92 --> 10699.0
section

10694.68 --> 10701.720000000001
right well by the way Geeks can be super

10699.0 --> 10705.479
sociable they can be really like the

10701.72 --> 10707.479
social person that's like keeping a

10705.479 --> 10710.599999999999
group together or likes to connect up

10707.479 --> 10712.84
people or is like that figure that keeps

10710.6 --> 10716.08
a friend group together and contacts

10712.84 --> 10718.960000000001
everybody every time that can be a geek

10716.08 --> 10718.96
it's not going to be a

10722.92 --> 10725.92
nerd

10737.399 --> 10742.76
every I socialize a lot with people

10739.319 --> 10742.76
share this interest

10743.96 --> 10750.519999999999
right socially clueless exactly right so

10747.64 --> 10750.519999999999
that's really the big

10752.84 --> 10755.84
difference

10759.68 --> 10767.92
they're often skilled in stem Fields

10763.2 --> 10767.92
what does that mean what does a stem

10771.239 --> 10776.239
field geek at the comic clown yes

10780.279 --> 10786.16
exactly it's like on average Geeks are

10782.96 --> 10786.16
more sociable that

10788.16 --> 10793.08
nerds the difference being that Geeks

10790.56 --> 10795.56
don't necessarily have to be have to be

10793.08 --> 10797.84
really smart well you can't really you

10795.56 --> 10801.0
can't be a nerd if you're not really

10797.84 --> 10803.56
smart I mean there's not going to be

10801.0 --> 10806.72
like a Down syndrome

10803.56 --> 10810.439
nerd I mean they might be like oh that's

10806.72 --> 10812.199999999999
that's that's Corky the computer guy and

10810.439 --> 10815.239
he's like he's pretty

10812.2 --> 10818.0
good for a Down in person but I mean

10815.239 --> 10820.239
he's not going to be like a super nerd

10818.0 --> 10822.319
or well maybe he is maybe I'm like I'm

10820.239 --> 10824.08
threading some really sensitive grounds

10822.319 --> 10826.56
now

10824.08 --> 10828.2
maybe yeah but it's because like down

10826.56 --> 10829.56
syndrome people are so freaking

10828.2 --> 10832.279
misunderstood

10829.56 --> 10835.0
anyway they don't necessarily have to be

10832.279 --> 10837.04
freaking stupid so yeah a Down syndrome

10835.0 --> 10839.359
can definitely be a

10837.04 --> 10842.160000000002
nerd but I mean it's not going to be

10839.359 --> 10842.16
very common

10842.72 --> 10845.72
though

10847.04 --> 10850.0
it's nerds at

10860.52 --> 10867.2
ComicCon sorry oh stem is a science

10863.92 --> 10869.439
technology engineering and

10867.2 --> 10872.439
Mathematics

10869.439 --> 10872.439
okay

10872.64 --> 10875.64
h

10880.76 --> 10885.72
yeah by the way just for the

10882.8 --> 10888.199999999999
record I like down syndrome people and I

10885.72 --> 10890.039999999999
mean it like there's somebody here in

10888.2 --> 10893.0
this neighborhood who's like a Down

10890.04 --> 10895.800000000001
Syndrome guy he's pretty young and he's

10893.0 --> 10898.12
awesome he's like super nice and he's

10895.8 --> 10900.759999999998
like very eager for social contact and I

10898.12 --> 10902.160000000002
think he's like he thinks I'm cool he

10900.76 --> 10904.6
probably thinks a whole bunch of people

10902.16 --> 10907.08
are cool I'm not sure but he's cool he's

10904.6 --> 10910.68
actually cool and he doesn't look really

10907.08 --> 10912.72
dumb I like them I I think down CER

10910.68 --> 10914.960000000001
unless they're like really like

10912.72 --> 10917.399
completely drowned in their own ego

10914.96 --> 10920.319
which can happen with Down Syndrome

10917.399 --> 10922.599999999999
people they can become super

10920.319 --> 10924.039999999999
egotistical and that's [ __ ] annoying

10922.6 --> 10926.279
when they get like that and usually when

10924.04 --> 10927.279
they're like that they don't ever change

10926.279 --> 10930.52
back it's

10927.279 --> 10932.880000000001
[ __ ] but as long as they don't go well

10930.52 --> 10936.08
corrupted like that down syndrome people

10932.88 --> 10939.199999999999
can be freaking awesome and like so

10936.08 --> 10942.399
positive and [ __ ] and like

10939.2 --> 10944.479000000001
real have a real drive to like create

10942.399 --> 10947.8
positivity and all that I love

10944.479 --> 10949.76
that and when you give him that they're

10947.8 --> 10951.319
it's not like they're like always dumb

10949.76 --> 10953.359
about whatever they do they're not

10951.319 --> 10957.08
always

10953.359 --> 10959.68
dumb so every time I say like oh [ __ ]

10957.08 --> 10963.16
this guy's a [ __ ] or something when I

10959.68 --> 10966.04
say that I definitely don't mean a Down

10963.16 --> 10969.76
syndrome person I don't even think of

10966.04 --> 10971.399000000001
down syndrome peering people as retards

10969.76 --> 10974.16
like

10971.399 --> 10977.72
that right I mean oh they might

10974.16 --> 10979.76
technically be more [ __ ] on average

10977.72 --> 10981.92
clinically or something but that does

10979.76 --> 10986.08
not for me a reason to then think that

10981.92 --> 10988.64
they're all retards absolutely

10986.08 --> 10992.279
not so just I just want to make that

10988.64 --> 10995.8
clear that I actually have like I like

10992.279 --> 10998.239
like technically if I had kids I

10995.8 --> 10999.64
probably would I would keep a Down

10998.239 --> 11002.64
Syndrome kid if it was there I don't

10999.64 --> 11006.92
think I'd get one it's not in my family

11002.64 --> 11008.72
at all but I mean like I think that yeah

11006.92 --> 11011.64
they've been downplayed a lot I think

11008.72 --> 11014.039999999999
they're they can be pretty cool if you

11011.64 --> 11014.039999999999
just

11014.2 --> 11020.640000000001
like if you if they have the cap yeah if

11017.239 --> 11022.64
they have the room to do the things that

11020.64 --> 11024.84
those well that down syndrome people

11022.64 --> 11027.76
typically like to to do and are get good

11024.84 --> 11030.2
at like manual labor they can get really

11027.76 --> 11030.2
good at

11030.88 --> 11037.08
that like actually really good and like

11034.88 --> 11039.759999999998
Loving It

11037.08 --> 11042.64
Anyway would you keep one that's

11039.76 --> 11044.279
generous what the hell okay it's not

11042.64 --> 11048.199999999999
like I'm going to adopt them I'm just

11044.279 --> 11051.960000000001
saying that if I had one in my range of

11048.2 --> 11055.399000000001
kids I'd keep it would be pretty cool to

11051.96 --> 11055.399
also have a Down Syndrome kid in

11055.76 --> 11062.16
there right it's yeah I don't I don't

11059.279 --> 11065.479000000001
know I I feel like it like own Benjamin

11062.16 --> 11068.319
does he said that too I feel like that I

11065.479 --> 11070.438999999998
mean I'd be a bit freaked out if it were

11068.319 --> 11074.0
like the first kid I got or something

11070.439 --> 11076.880000000001
okay then yeah then I'd get like uh this

11074.0 --> 11078.8
is not good I'd probably still keep it

11076.88 --> 11081.0
but I mean I'd be freaking worried if

11078.8 --> 11081.0
that

11081.439 --> 11087.92
happened but

11084.16 --> 11087.92
yeah I don't expect that at

11112.279 --> 11116.640000000001
all

11114.279 --> 11118.279
right but I I mean I wouldn't be like I

11116.64 --> 11121.358999999999
I wouldn't want a situation where it's

11118.279 --> 11123.720000000001
like oh I got one kid the kid has Down

11121.359 --> 11125.76
syndrome that would kind of suck but if

11123.72 --> 11128.199999999999
I'd have a family like with multiple

11125.76 --> 11130.960000000001
kids and having one of them have Down

11128.2 --> 11133.960000000001
syndrome wouldn't be all that

11130.96 --> 11133.96
terrible

11136.399 --> 11141.519999999999
right and they're very they can be very

11139.239 --> 11145.08
strong yes SE

11141.52 --> 11147.239
tappy which why I said they like if they

11145.08 --> 11149.399
if you can get them to really appreciate

11147.239 --> 11153.239
doing manual labor they can become

11149.399 --> 11157.239
really good at it like actually like

11153.239 --> 11157.239
Surplus good at

11166.0 --> 11172.16
it like got a Down Syndrome kid well as

11169.76 --> 11175.6
soon as they come of age like dude just

11172.16 --> 11178.84
send them at work on a farm they'll love

11175.6 --> 11181.800000000001
it they will actually love it like lots

11178.84 --> 11183.76
of Labor pretty tough and they got they

11181.8 --> 11185.64
they'll build even more condition than

11183.76 --> 11187.800000000001
they'll naturally have they'll just be

11185.64 --> 11190.08
crushing it all

11187.8 --> 11193.319
day

11190.08 --> 11193.319

yeah and yeah exactly Rich yeah a lot of

11210.96 --> 11217.438999999998
down syndrome people have a great sense

11212.76 --> 11217.439
of humor they may they like to make

11232.12 --> 11235.12
jokes

11424.84 --> 11429.76
become part of PayPal it's really easy

11427.6 --> 11433.439
to do that some people can't for some

11429.76 --> 11435.64
reason some people oh I morally object

11433.439 --> 11438.319
because they did something sometime yeah

11435.64 --> 11440.96
they did a lot of things sometime yeah

11438.319 --> 11444.0
however it's literally the only system

11440.96 --> 11447.08
that allows trans

11444.0 --> 11451.12
transational money transfer like that

11447.08 --> 11451.12
donations it's the only

[Music]

11779.92 --> 11785.04
income I'm sure you know that yeah well

saying that I'm definitely going to hold

11932.479 --> 11940.278999999999
you to that yeah cuz I am working on it

11936.92 --> 11942.52
the thing is if i' ever want to see any

11940.279 --> 11945.12
money come out of that ever that's going

11942.52 --> 11945.880000000001
to take years to get to that point you

11945.12 --> 11949.640000000001
get

11945.88 --> 11951.399
it it doesn't help my situation yeah my

11949.64 --> 11952.599999999999
situation is not going to be fixed if

11951.399 --> 11955.479
I'm going to say

11952.6 --> 11958.92
[ __ ] it I'm just going to do this and

11955.479 --> 11961.319
just work on it until it's done and if I

11958.92 --> 11964.08
starve in between well then I'll die

11961.319 --> 11967.039999999999
doing it yeah that's not a viable

11964.08 --> 11969.64
strategy I'm not going to do that I'm

11967.04 --> 11971.880000000001
not just going to like say oh well I

11969.64 --> 11974.039999999999
don't really need to eat for three weeks

11971.88 --> 11975.358999999999
straight you know I could just [ __ ]

11974.04 --> 11978.239000000001
starve to

11975.359 --> 11980.279
death and then like yeah and I'll do

11978.239 --> 11983.279
something else at the same time so I can

11980.279 --> 11986.199
get out of this poverty and then just

11983.279 --> 11990.6
starve to death in between trying to do

11986.199 --> 11990.6
that yeah brilliant brilliant strategy

11990.84 --> 11993.84
man

12001.76 --> 12006.0
no it's really hard to starve to death

12004.279 --> 12010.960000000001
in the N yeah it isn't as hard as it

12006.0 --> 12013.84
used to be zeppy it's much easier

12010.96 --> 12016.358999999999
now

12013.84 --> 12018.64
and there are people actually starving

12016.359 --> 12018.640000000001
to

12019.52 --> 12022.800000000001
death on

12034.479 --> 12038.438999999998
record there's always a food bank yeah

12037.12 --> 12043.92
yeah guess

12038.439 --> 12043.92
what they don't have enough

12044.199 --> 12051.08
huh and besides what they have to offer

12048.239 --> 12054.08
I'd literally be better off not eating

12051.08 --> 12056.84
that and and starving it would be less

12054.08 --> 12056.84
unhealthy for

12068.12 --> 12076.560000000001
me so how about stop advising

12073.76 --> 12079.399
me

12076.56 --> 12083.56
yeah I just need

12079.399 --> 12087.08
support I need people to realize

12083.56 --> 12087.08
that and that's

12098.6 --> 12103.52
it writing code takes less energy than

12101.84 --> 12106.68
running a

12103.52 --> 12108.199
stream that depends on how good you how

12106.68 --> 12112.199
you're used to it I mean for me it's

12108.199 --> 12116.52
going to be a huge headache at first at

12112.199 --> 12118.0
least or you probably latter part more

12116.52 --> 12120.560000000001
when you have to

12118.0 --> 12123.279
like round it

12120.56 --> 12126.198999999999
out and I've never done it before it's

12123.279 --> 12130.640000000001
going to be a pretty high strain

12126.199 --> 12132.279
yeah I've never done it before the last

12130.64 --> 12136.56
time I programmed

12132.279 --> 12136.560000000001
anything it was commodor

12137.359 --> 12141.08

happen

eventually when I go I delete everything

12308.84 --> 12313.199

because then there's literally nothing

12313.199 --> 12319.720000000001
that can pull me back somehow and

12315.92 --> 12325.319
prevent me from seeking an a source of

12319.72 --> 12326.92
activity that will actually not make me

what I can do according to you outside

12423.12 --> 12428.880000000001
of running this show they will prevent

12425.8 --> 12430.679999999998
me from eventually deleting the channel

12428.88 --> 12432.64
because I don't get enough income

12430.68 --> 12435.399
through the channel channel to keep

12432.64 --> 12438.0
myself from starving yeah that's how it

12435.399 --> 12441.72
is it's how it's going to be and it's

12438.0 --> 12444.6
not going to change no matter what the

12441.72 --> 12449.358999999999

[ __ ] angry for half an hour to get

12512.92 --> 12515.68
through to

12520.199 --> 12523.199
people

12525.199 --> 12532.720000000001

12536.16 --> 12545.479
me or I go away I don't need words do

12542.319 --> 12549.56
you understand I don't need words I

12545.479 --> 12553.8
don't need your input from

12549.56 --> 12557.278999999999
chat input from chat will not improve my

12553.8 --> 12557.278999999999
condition do you

12558.279 --> 12564.359
understand I don't oh you don't think I

12560.68 --> 12567.720000000001
should do it well then I need support to

12564.359 --> 12570.04
prevent me from eventually doing

12567.72 --> 12574.0
that

12570.04 --> 12575.439
yeah opinions don't matter what matters

12574.0 --> 12579.439
is that I get

12575.439 --> 12581.68
support so that I don't starve to death

12579.439 --> 12585.439
and that I don't delete the channel

12581.68 --> 12587.76
to prevent myself from actually becoming

12585.439 --> 12589.92
sick and starving to death because I

12587.76 --> 12591.800000000001
just can't let go because I invested so

12589.92 --> 12594.52
much time and energy into it it's going

12591.8 --> 12597.278999999999
to be very very hard to let that go but

12594.52 --> 12600.08
if I'm actually finding proof that I'm

12597.279 --> 12604.319000000001
literally starving then I will

12600.08 --> 12606.8
eventually delete it because I can't

12604.319 --> 12610.278999999999
afford my

12606.8 --> 12613.039999999999
sympathy to cause me to starve to death

12610.279 --> 12613.04
anymore

12614.72 --> 12618.278999999999
yeah do you get

12622.0 --> 12628.88
it I need support or I'll go away it's

12626.0 --> 12628.88
not a [ __ ]

12630.64 --> 12637.0
joke and if if you can't give it well

12633.84 --> 12639.399
too bad go look for another [ __ ] live

12637.0 --> 12639.399
