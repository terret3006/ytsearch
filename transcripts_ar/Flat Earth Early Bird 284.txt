[Music]

64.479 --> 72.009
that would be much appreciated so today

67.72 --> 74.2
it's just so incredibly hot it's not

72.009 --> 78.7
even funny anymore it's almost seems

74.2 --> 82.35000000000001
even hotter than it was last month yeah

78.7 --> 85.84
in contrast to yesterday for some

82.35 --> 90.78899999999999
miraculous reason there don't seem to be

85.84 --> 93.819
any chemtrails whatsoever it's the same

90.789 --> 97.56
kind of day same kind of heat wind

93.819 --> 100.66
everything but now no chemtrails and no

97.56 --> 105.91
compare the difference to the shot

100.66 --> 108.09899999999999
yesterday the bluest can be although

105.91 --> 110.44
yeah at the horizon it's getting a bit

108.099 --> 110.92
grayish because I think there's a lot of

110.44 --> 113.619
moist

110.92 --> 118.42
basically if evaporating because of this

113.619 --> 124.0
heat so anyway I got with me today

118.42 --> 130.14000000000001
orange juice tangerine got some lemonade

124.0 --> 130.14
in the in the cooler forgot it oh well

130.26 --> 139.69
so let's see who's here already got some

135.67 --> 145.569
monkey 3d Steve drunken bullet for a11

139.69 --> 150.3

145.569 --> 152.79
Eli Ohio Steve

150.3 --> 155.31
stopping traffic I'm arrests I had brand

152.79 --> 157.47
em and had a bear good to see you all

155.31 --> 163.02
Pat Boone for the $5 shoe but you had

157.47 --> 170.52
donation but yeah yesterday was a pretty

163.02 --> 176.39000000000001
shitty day for me in general are you

170.52 --> 180.0
getting this it's probably not true

176.39 --> 182.30999999999997
anyway Thank You Julie Julie oh problem

180.0 --> 188.28
for the superjet EnOcean good morning

182.31 --> 191.01
but yeah yesterday seems like things

188.28 --> 191.79
were in the air for me to explode one

191.01 --> 197.09
way or the other

191.79 --> 200.73
tensions were there it wasn't just a a

197.09 --> 203.22
temporary thing I was just really pissed

200.73 --> 211.04999999999998
off at the end this most of you found

203.22 --> 214.59
out by now must have and what seemed

211.05 --> 218.4
like a very little thing to probably a

214.59 --> 221.91
lot of people was a big thing and it was

218.4 --> 226.23000000000002
enough for me to just take my things and

221.91 --> 228.9
leave and I'm not going back not not

226.23 --> 234.48
like this just not just yet although a

228.9 --> 240.3
kind of message Nathan directly and God

234.48 --> 242.82
relayed that's that that giant turd that

240.3 --> 245.94
rant he left in the master bee after I

242.82 --> 251.82
left so I got to see that he talked to

245.94 --> 254.12
Nathan about hasn't aired yet really no

251.82 --> 254.12
goody

254.33 --> 260.48900000000003
Wow you'll find out it's it's short I

257.43 --> 262.29
just got pissed off right let me just

260.489 --> 265.34999999999997
shortly explain it to those who don't

262.29 --> 267.86
know right so was just streaming live

265.35 --> 267.86
and everything

269.8 --> 276.74
and yeah this guy apparently a ran Tino

274.19 --> 279.53
knows called a rude earther

276.74 --> 282.26
who supported him bla bla Boatright I

279.53 --> 285.38
don't really give a [ __ ] he just was all

282.26 --> 289.01
weird loudmouth and threatening in the

285.38 --> 293.48
chat to me specifically constantly my

289.01 --> 295.36
name and first if you dare bad me bla

293.48 --> 299.24
I'm gonna do this and that so I thought

295.36 --> 302.03000000000003
okay it doesn't make any sense just

299.24 --> 306.01
timing enough but yeah then after that

302.03 --> 309.40999999999997
he started to literally describe

306.01 --> 312.40999999999997
physically threatening me and doing

309.41 --> 317.03000000000003
things in specific locations at specific

312.41 --> 319.61
times so he was about as literally liya

317.03 --> 322.09999999999997
bleah physically threatening me with

319.61 --> 323.6
physical harm or not physically for he

322.1 --> 326.99
was threatening me with physical harm

323.6 --> 333.65000000000003
very straightforward probably liable for

326.99 --> 337.49
that and I thought this this this is ban

333.65 --> 339.40999999999997
worthy and ranty undid that because why

337.49 --> 342.77
would it do why would i ban anyone

339.41 --> 345.41
that's literally threatening me with

342.77 --> 346.58
physical harm like a [ __ ] psychopath

345.41 --> 349.19
why would I do that

346.58 --> 351.08
you know this ranty is so funny to him

349.19 --> 352.64
everything is funny it's very funny when

351.08 --> 355.66999999999996
you're Psychopaths then everything

352.64 --> 358.63
becomes funny why is he so excited about

355.67 --> 363.08000000000004
something you don't even sense you know

358.63 --> 364.88
anyway yeah Nathan didn't respond the

363.08 --> 369.91999999999996
right way and it just didn't take it

364.88 --> 375.56
seriously so I left after telling him to

369.92 --> 377.3
shove his show off his ass and well

375.56 --> 380.27
afterward I sent him a message is

377.3 --> 383.62
slightly more polite and he didn't

380.27 --> 386.45
really do anything with it except get

383.62 --> 390.68
the sign that he's read it and he was

386.45 --> 392.3
kind of nice to me it probably means

390.68 --> 394.31
it's just too much for him to handle

392.3 --> 398.38
this and although you didn't mention

394.31 --> 398.38
that apparently Randy is gonna

399.07 --> 404.71
his rat wrench would be revoked now and

402.28 --> 412.84
I don't know it's kind of too late to me

404.71 --> 416.89
really it's just you know we've almost

412.84 --> 420.34
literally been working colleagues in the

416.89 --> 429.96999999999997
same fields in the same room almost four

420.34 --> 433.57
years now and to then still be treated

429.97 --> 436.84000000000003
like this it's not a joke it's not a

433.57 --> 440.17
joke to me and I'm just like I don't

436.84 --> 443.56
want to I don't want to be put in that

440.17 --> 447.46000000000004
position again it's just it really sucks

443.56 --> 447.94
and I I really just want to get out of

447.46 --> 450.21999999999997
here

447.94 --> 452.44
not that I'm gonna stop the early bird

450.22 --> 456.16
show although yeah I don't know you know

452.44 --> 460.27
because I'm pretty damn aware that the

456.16 --> 462.67
show is basically a branch off in its

460.27 --> 465.90999999999997
own fashion of the of the Flat Earth

462.67 --> 467.65000000000003
debates and almost everything I really

465.91 --> 470.53000000000003
learned concerning flat earth and

467.65 --> 472.39
science relearning the science it's all

470.53 --> 474.42999999999995
centered around the Flat Earth debate so

472.39 --> 476.28999999999996
like if I just leave yeah there's

474.43 --> 480.73
doesn't feel like there would be much

476.29 --> 483.06
left for me after that but I can't go on

480.73 --> 487.42
like this [ __ ] I just can't do it

483.06 --> 494.82
so whatever whatever comes on my path

487.42 --> 494.82
after this we'll see I don't know but

497.01 --> 502.71999999999997
and I'm not saying like I deserve this

500.23 --> 504.91
absolute immunity now or anything

502.72 --> 508.27000000000004
absolutely not I can be annoying too I

504.91 --> 512.11
can be chatty too chatty and I deserve

508.27 --> 515.68
an RN sometimes I definitely do but to

512.11 --> 518.349
be treated like this no nobody deserves

515.68 --> 520.9599999999999
that you know and it doesn't make any

518.349 --> 524.38
damn sense in any context either because

520.96 --> 529.09
not even five minutes before that rant

524.38 --> 532.14
e-band P Mars in the chat just like that

529.09 --> 537.96
because while P Mars was getting

532.14 --> 539.64
they disgusting yeah toying with I don't

537.96 --> 542.01
even remember the details of it I think

539.64 --> 546.63
it was some suicide Joker's it was

542.01 --> 550.28
disgusting so he deserved it well how is

546.63 --> 552.78
that why is that van worthy when

550.28 --> 555.03
somebody else is not joking about

552.78 --> 556.77
something disgusting but just literally

555.03 --> 563.22
threatening somebody with physical

556.77 --> 567.18
violence there is no logos there's no

563.22 --> 570.57
logos in that at all and I have to step

567.18 --> 573.4799999999999
away until it's resolved by the way

570.57 --> 580.44
thank you Amanda young for the $4 super

573.48 --> 585.86
jet donation you left the show I also

580.44 --> 585.86
left you oh you so you were there right

587.12 --> 596.93
look you don't really have to leave if

591.86 --> 596.9300000000001
you know it is Daily Show it's just that

598.07 --> 606.3900000000001
they don't even know how to explain this

604.17 --> 610.79
it's just that the social contract and

606.39 --> 610.79
being offered is not no longer viable

611.72 --> 618.72
it's a social contract it's an unspoken

615.02 --> 621.14
relation it's no longer viable for me at

618.72 --> 621.14
this point

623.16 --> 635.37
I knew you were gonna do that but look I

632.87 --> 637.77
don't know what's gonna happen next few

635.37 --> 639.3
days I don't know if anything even

637.77 --> 641.01
noteworthy is happening or that now

639.3 --> 643.29
everybody's going to decide to just take

641.01 --> 655.14
a vacation to walk out or whatever I

643.29 --> 657.54
don't know but I just need to turn over

655.14 --> 661.1
the page in a way and I don't know what

657.54 --> 661.0999999999999
I'm gonna be finding on the other side

662.51 --> 668.1899999999999
but look I will still keep the show

665.22 --> 669.9300000000001
going maybe it'll start to feel slightly

668.19 --> 677.24
different and it's more gonna be like

669.93 --> 680.3399999999999
the Arwen online blog I don't know maybe

677.24 --> 685.13
yeah I don't know I just don't know at

680.34 --> 689.25
this point I just know that I've been

685.13 --> 692.46
physically ill over the stress that's a

689.25 --> 695.85
side effect of this all because I don't

692.46 --> 698.52
know it's I'm sensitive and I take all

695.85 --> 702.48
of this stuff very serious well some

698.52 --> 704.88
people seem to just go through half

702.48 --> 706.5
their life and social relations like

704.88 --> 708.39
it's some kind of joke and that's

706.5 --> 710.7
perfectly fine for them it really

708.39 --> 714.33
doesn't matter it it really doesn't

710.7 --> 717.3900000000001
touch them well it does with me and I

714.33 --> 723.9000000000001
can't adapt to that it's damaging to me

717.39 --> 726.4399999999999
it literally makes me nauseated it's tea

723.9 --> 728.6999999999999
time Arwen yeah maybe maybe it will be

726.44 --> 736.3800000000001
although I don't have any tea with me

728.7 --> 740.76
today it's Jamie Brown you know let's

736.38 --> 745.58
not go there Jamie Brown is way too wait

740.76 --> 745.58
to bite easy with stupid stuff

747.82 --> 758.3000000000001
he bites in every rumor just yeah it's

752.96 --> 761.36
no use you know if you just repeat a

758.3 --> 762.7099999999999
couple of weird littles things to him he

761.36 --> 769.88
still he'll start repeating it

762.71 --> 772.9100000000001
eventually yeah including like the this

769.88 --> 775.91
the really stupid stuff so yeah I don't

772.91 --> 779.7099999999999
know there's no conversation that's

775.91 --> 779.7099999999999
gonna yield anything like that

791.18 --> 799.79
look Fyodor Dostoevsky I I don't really

795.95 --> 802.1600000000001
see how nathan is doing anything you

799.79 --> 804.41
know at least he has contributed to me

802.16 --> 806.24
and with small super chat donations yeah

804.41 --> 808.49
well that's apparently what people think

806.24 --> 811.61
I'm worth because I'm not worth like

808.49 --> 814.07
these hundred-dollar droppers that for

811.61 --> 816.529
example Randy with all his noise in his

814.07 --> 820.6700000000001
health flamin [ __ ] and methyl and who

816.529 --> 822.89
I'm the best in the world everyone that

820.67 --> 825.9499999999999
well people apparently love that so much

822.89 --> 830.6
that they just take their entire wallet

825.95 --> 832.85
and just throw it at people so yeah I'm

830.6 --> 836.39
not gonna do that so I'm not gonna get

832.85 --> 842.6
that apparently because I guess that I

836.39 --> 845.93
don't know terrible behavior just tends

842.6 --> 848.0600000000001
to loosen the money with some people for

845.93 --> 851.06
some reason I don't know what that is

848.06 --> 853.01
but I'm very happy with the support that

851.06 --> 856.43
I'm getting although I definitely wish

853.01 --> 858.17
it would be more yeah it's not like no

856.43 --> 869.38
of course I want more

858.17 --> 876.9499999999999
what Oh Rasta oh Lord oh Lord

869.38 --> 880.13
yeah well it's a bit conspiracy thingy

876.95 --> 882.2900000000001
but it may be something to it with I

880.13 --> 888.67
don't even know how to figure that one

882.29 --> 891.65
out but look there were things said

888.67 --> 895.01
among one another with one another and

891.65 --> 897.35
he even blurted out a lot in the

895.01 --> 902.89
beginning all by himself right in the

897.35 --> 905.44
open on record and I don't know

902.89 --> 908.4399999999999
I don't know what the hell he think he's

905.44 --> 911.08
doing to be fair I think he's just going

908.44 --> 912.25
to Luciferian route he just wants to say

911.08 --> 914.44
yes correct

912.25 --> 917.59
I want to do exactly what I want to do

914.44 --> 921.0100000000001
no matter the cost and he's just gonna

917.59 --> 923.9200000000001
be elbowing setting things on fire and

921.01 --> 928.63
partying until basically the fuel runs

923.92 --> 932.11
out and everybody is mangled and hurt

928.63 --> 934.96
and betrayed and their show is destroyed

932.11 --> 937.8100000000001
and turned to trolls and then it's just

934.96 --> 942.2800000000001
gonna exit scene I think that is what he

937.81 --> 945.63
will do because I really genuinely think

942.28 --> 950.86
that in the bottom of his heart

945.63 --> 952.6
Randi truly truly only cares about Randi

950.86 --> 959.92
and nothing else

952.6 --> 962.08
there's no no priority but that one and

959.92 --> 970.93
that's what I think and that's what I

962.08 --> 974.2900000000001
think it'll lead to is my prediction and

970.93 --> 976.3599999999999
I really sad about it because in the

974.29 --> 979.0899999999999
beginning I thought Randy was a really

976.36 --> 980.92
cool guy and that is also the part that

979.09 --> 985.84
hurts so much

980.92 --> 988.9599999999999
now anyway I look rasta had there's not

985.84 --> 991.6
much to talk about with Samhain he's a

988.96 --> 997.24
big sponsor he's been sponsor for me I

991.6 --> 999.76
don't know who he is I have no idea if

997.24 --> 1004.05
you got a background check and go ahead

999.76 --> 1010.26
I don't have it I know he's what I think

1004.05 --> 1013.02
from Germany think I'm not sure it could

1010.26 --> 1017.3
be American I don't know but I don't

1013.02 --> 1017.3
really see a direct problem there

1018.45 --> 1029.459
and besides it's just one one of the of

1022.86 --> 1031.38
the super chatters to big players a by

1029.459 --> 1035.0700000000002
coincidence also the one that actually

1031.38 --> 1040.8290000000002
has sponsored me and I'd yeah I don't

1035.07 --> 1044.3999999999999
see what the problem is he has made many

1040.829 --> 1046.6699999999998
claims it's been over ten ki what what

1044.4 --> 1046.67
do you mean

1055.28 --> 1063.3999999999999
uh Rastus coming loose yeah it's funny

1059.74 --> 1066.29
but rest that's a very special person in

1063.4 --> 1070.1000000000001
an intriguing way and not in a [ __ ]

1066.29 --> 1073.01
way because yeah I've talked to Rasta

1070.1 --> 1075.05
for some time in background up and forth

1073.01 --> 1080.99
and we have our own personal arguments

1075.05 --> 1083.72
and it's just yeah but he's been weirdly

1080.99 --> 1085.7
predicting things about people and he

1083.72 --> 1088.16
does it weigh in the start and it's very

1085.7 --> 1092.05
confusing because he makes predictions

1088.16 --> 1095.3000000000002
about people I'm just getting to know

1092.05 --> 1097.8799999999999
that after years the kind of like

1095.3 --> 1100.58
turnout to go that direction it's really

1097.88 --> 1110.0800000000002
frustrating sometimes especially when he

1100.58 --> 1113.27
goes I don't you I do you yeah Rasta

1110.08 --> 1113.27
[Music]

1123.62 --> 1131.9899999999998
well yeah that is pretty insane although

1128.22 --> 1141.3500000000001
yet still look 10k really is jump change

1131.99 --> 1145.049
10k is a middle-class bad month okay so

1141.35 --> 1146.52
but I think that if you get 10k through

1145.049 --> 1149.04
Super chats and all that you're

1146.52 --> 1151.53
definitely gonna have some tax

1149.04 --> 1155.4289999999999
involvement with that I don't know what

1151.53 --> 1159.6299999999999
he's gonna do you know who knows maybe

1155.429 --> 1162.21
he'll suddenly get a big tax bill that

1159.63 --> 1164.6100000000001
he didn't expect basically like I did

1162.21 --> 1169.98
this is because I have two freakin super

1164.61 --> 1172.9499999999998
cats it's a nice nice check for my job

1169.98 --> 1175.8600000000001
of an official registered job employee

1172.95 --> 1181.4
with money yeah so I do have a job here

1175.86 --> 1184.62
at Google having a live stream but yeah

1181.4 --> 1189.45
after a few months that's pretty much

1184.62 --> 1191.1299999999999
taken out of what I get then so it's

1189.45 --> 1194.669
kind of for me alone

1191.13 --> 1197.669
rather than actual earnings that way but

1194.669 --> 1200.0700000000002
yeah it is what it is and as I've tried

1197.669 --> 1202.26
to tell people that can completely be

1200.07 --> 1206.04
bypassed by using the other three

1202.26 --> 1209.0
mediums especially PayPal because it's

1206.04 --> 1213.1789999999999
very quick but the other ones as well

1209.0 --> 1216.09
because they are not connected into the

1213.179 --> 1218.6100000000001
official payout from the company Google

1216.09 --> 1220.47
to me as an employee so I don't have to

1218.61 --> 1223.11
register that to my taxes so they don't

1220.47 --> 1225.049
take it out of my check that's why I

1223.11 --> 1230.4299999999998
really prefer that

1225.049 --> 1232.7
don't forget but

1230.43 --> 1238.22
[Music]

1232.7 --> 1241.32
it is all what it is and I'm still glad

1238.22 --> 1243.27
I'm still happy with my audience I'm

1241.32 --> 1245.31
still happy with my shows and my

1243.27 --> 1247.8
performance and my subscribers have been

1245.31 --> 1251.01
growing steadily despite everything and

1247.8 --> 1253.85
I have physically noticed or visually

1251.01 --> 1257.37
noticed that new people really have come

1253.85 --> 1259.7099999999998
in the show and are now part of the

1257.37 --> 1265.08
conversation and part of the group so

1259.71 --> 1268.53
yeah it's not just these numbers of my

1265.08 --> 1270.33
channel it's also literally the activity

1268.53 --> 1273.03
that I'm seeing and I'm very happy with

1270.33 --> 1275.82
that and I'm very thankful for everyone

1273.03 --> 1280.01
that has found my show worthy enough to

1275.82 --> 1280.01
come and visit every day and have talk

1289.669 --> 1297.519
well that is kind of freaky Zep tepi I

1295.129 --> 1302.7089999999998
think that through the super chat I

1297.519 --> 1307.459
think that Google is making huge profits

1302.709 --> 1310.19
huge profits from flattered so huge that

1307.459 --> 1312.769
they basically can't narrow down they

1310.19 --> 1314.5700000000002
can't choke the amount of subscribers

1312.769 --> 1317.1490000000001
and people that get to see it to

1314.57 --> 1319.249
absolute extinction point because they

1317.149 --> 1323.57
would literally be shooting their foot

1319.249 --> 1325.759
off if they did it I think that really

1323.57 --> 1329.749
the flat earth scene on YouTube makes

1325.759 --> 1332.119
huge amounts of money although yeah it

1329.749 --> 1336.739
does kind of bleach compared to for

1332.119 --> 1338.9289999999999
example those YouTube gamers that do

1336.739 --> 1344.029
that stuff because some of them rake in

1338.929 --> 1346.8790000000001
like well like twenty thousand a month

1344.029 --> 1350.329
or something its consent more even much

1346.879 --> 1352.849
more but those are directly also

1350.329 --> 1354.859
connected in with gaming companies so

1352.849 --> 1357.4399999999998
it's kind of a synergy thing where

1354.859 --> 1359.869
there's gaming companies there's Google

1357.44 --> 1362.509
they all try to work together and the

1359.869 --> 1364.809
people that are using the platforms and

1362.509 --> 1368.019
using the games are basically being

1364.809 --> 1370.039
rearranged to optimally advertise that

1368.019 --> 1372.469
infrastructure for them and spread that

1370.039 --> 1375.2
and that's why they get full priority

1372.469 --> 1378.829
and that's and that's why they

1375.2 --> 1382.969
eventually collect so much money because

1378.829 --> 1385.759
it's it's win-win profit for for the big

1382.969 --> 1387.979
companies when they do that and Flat

1385.759 --> 1389.809
Earth is not so win-win had it it's only

1387.979 --> 1394.219
win-win for the streaming platform

1389.809 --> 1400.459
really animal I guess for yeah so for

1394.219 --> 1404.269
cameras maybe I think Nikon has probably

1400.459 --> 1407.75
made a substantial profit since 2015

1404.269 --> 1409.78
thanks to flattered scene

1407.75 --> 1409.78
Oh

1414.65 --> 1417.8590000000002
[Music]

1419.99 --> 1427.57
Copernicus thinker if it was so simple

1423.82 --> 1431.6589999999999
that none of us would have been here

1427.57 --> 1433.97
it's you know that clovers and trolls

1431.659 --> 1436.46
but especially honest clovers have been

1433.97 --> 1441.26
saying that in chat for over four years

1436.46 --> 1443.39
and not just my chat but just every chat

1441.26 --> 1445.64
I've ever seen where Flat Earth has had

1443.39 --> 1448.5490000000002
live streams they all had just this

1445.64 --> 1451.669
wishful dream it's almost the same dream

1448.549 --> 1454.299
as the globe itself and one day going to

1451.669 --> 1457.4
space with everyone going exploring and

1454.299 --> 1460.52
that dream it's just like it's always

1457.4 --> 1465.49
there so in the Ennis energy with that

1460.52 --> 1468.62
you uphold the dream that one day

1465.49 --> 1471.5
finally the flat-earthers will see at

1468.62 --> 1473.6589999999999
some point that it was all just nonsense

1471.5 --> 1477.409
and they will just move on back to the

1473.659 --> 1479.8700000000001
globe get back to the reality and they

1477.409 --> 1482.0590000000002
literally are looking forward to that

1479.87 --> 1485.6
day coming well if they actually look at

1482.059 --> 1488.35
the situation they would know abundantly

1485.6 --> 1490.4599999999998
clear that's never gonna happen because

1488.35 --> 1492.32
otherwise it would have never even

1490.46 --> 1495.51
manifested in the first place

1492.32 --> 1495.51
[Music]

1510.66 --> 1517.17
yeah what's going on Hagrid wells you're

1515.52 --> 1519.83
claiming somebody's hacking your account

1517.17 --> 1519.8300000000002
it's weird

1528.86 --> 1533.76
what do you think about Nathan I'm

1531.99 --> 1535.97
missing out all kinds of conversation

1533.76 --> 1535.97
here

1586.39 --> 1589.39
okay

1593.54 --> 1597.07
hello goodtimz roll

1600.85 --> 1611.1999999999998
yeah it is isn't it yeah yeah him too

1606.81 --> 1614.77
you know it's so special everybody just

1611.2 --> 1618.99
keeps on doing the same [ __ ] it's like

1614.77 --> 1622.72
they're bartering to be allowed to sin

1618.99 --> 1623.56
in my vicinity and they just think it's

1622.72 --> 1625.96
all right

1623.56 --> 1627.9099999999999
it's like oh I'll just manipulate Arwen

1625.96 --> 1630.39
for a little play a little like this and

1627.91 --> 1635.47
then go do over the same thing again

1630.39 --> 1641.41
well no I'm not indulging that [ __ ] from

1635.47 --> 1644.29
anyone anymore okay so Jason mcCormick

1641.41 --> 1647.8600000000001
thought he would first apologize and

1644.29 --> 1650.98
kind of sound genuine and then I even

1647.86 --> 1653.9799999999998
said okay well maybe I'll consider it

1650.98 --> 1658.3
and then afterward he proceeded to caps

1653.98 --> 1662.35
spam his [ __ ] again just like he does so

1658.3 --> 1664.3
I said oh that case in that case I'm

1662.35 --> 1667.57
gonna bury and ban you for at least 30

1664.3 --> 1671.97
days so now I'm perfectly fine

1667.57 --> 1676.57
the guy he is like an advertisement

1671.97 --> 1679.06
bureau employee without the actual

1676.57 --> 1682.4199999999998
advertisement Bureau and he's just doing

1679.06 --> 1684.94
that for his religious [ __ ] he is the

1682.42 --> 1686.98
guy with a sign next to the road just

1684.94 --> 1689.92
constantly trying to shove that in

1686.98 --> 1692.85
people's faces for no damn reason that's

1689.92 --> 1697.14
what he's doing and it's really annoying

1692.85 --> 1697.1399999999999
getting just sick of it sorry

1708.96 --> 1722.44
YouTube is paid for by the US government

1712.24 --> 1724.27
were okay is it is Google subsidized by

1722.44 --> 1729.27
the US government I think it was

1724.27 --> 1734.95
originally designed with taxpayer money

1729.27 --> 1737.8899999999999
but yeah that was that but they're not

1734.95 --> 1741.13
like having constant subsidies I'm

1737.89 --> 1745.38
pretty sure they don't they're an

1741.13 --> 1747.9
independent company as far as I am aware

1745.38 --> 1752.88
although they do get special information

1747.9 --> 1752.88
privileges they had that that is true

1756.18 --> 1760.05
okay yeah goodbye

1763.63 --> 1770.97
now there was an obvious troll asking

1769.12 --> 1773.9699999999998
all the wrong questions without

1770.97 --> 1773.97
exception

1781.97 --> 1785.539
okay well rust that if you know that

1783.95 --> 1788.21
it's a fact that they are being

1785.539 --> 1791.09
subsidizes like to see some actual

1788.21 --> 1793.7
evidence of that I don't know maybe they

1791.09 --> 1796.279
are but I'd like to see how that works

1793.7 --> 1799.7
where is the the tax dollars where are

1796.279 --> 1806.23
they coming in and where are they going

1799.7 --> 1806.23
in the pockets of Google I don't know

1832.12 --> 1839.4099999999999
well I love for waking I I told you that

1835.9 --> 1842.1000000000001
before they did they do get a lot of

1839.41 --> 1846.49
information privileges access

1842.1 --> 1848.98
technological access and the US

1846.49 --> 1852.49
government practically paid for the

1848.98 --> 1857.6200000000001
design of their system of the Google

1852.49 --> 1864.13
system the development of it what is it

1857.62 --> 1869.1999999999998
called again forgotten name yeah so

1864.13 --> 1873.99
definitely Google was sprung forth from

1869.2 --> 1873.99
the US taxpayers so they do

1880.059 --> 1883.139
right right

1886.58 --> 1889.1799999999998
yeah

1898.559 --> 1902.519
Hardwell stop wasting my time with your

1901.23 --> 1904.74
conspiracy [ __ ]

1902.519 --> 1912.84
it's nothing gonna lead anywhere it's

1904.74 --> 1915.419
getting getting nerve-racking please if

1912.84 --> 1918.029
you think there's stuff out there that

1915.419 --> 1919.94
nobody knows about it why are you even

1918.029 --> 1927.57
telling it if you don't know about it

1919.94 --> 1930.779
stupid and besides it usually works

1927.57 --> 1933.779
slightly different what usually happens

1930.779 --> 1939.869
is they have something develop and test

1933.779 --> 1941.34
it and applied in secret and then when

1939.869 --> 1944.1899999999998
it's time to become public

1941.34 --> 1946.74
then they publicize that they just

1944.19 --> 1948.6000000000001
invented it basically so that's how

1946.74 --> 1951.6
everything afterwards come into play but

1948.6 --> 1955.4699999999998
there's not a giant amount of utilized

1951.6 --> 1958.9189999999999
secret [ __ ] going on absolutely not it's

1955.47 --> 1961.499
too risky to utilize secret stuff

1958.919 --> 1964.0490000000002
because just one little thing goes wrong

1961.499 --> 1969.769
then suddenly tired I think technology

1964.049 --> 1969.769
could be exposed there's no way no way

1981.51 --> 1991.799
yeah I doesn't matter who you mean yeah

1989.1 --> 1998.34
well they own you if you're gonna accept

1991.799 --> 2001.8799999999999
it I don't they can think whatever they

1998.34 --> 2005.2099999999998
want and they can abuse their money and

2001.88 --> 2007.97
power to try to manipulate everyone into

2005.21 --> 2017.51
thinking that they can doesn't mean that

2007.97 --> 2020.919
they do huh okay thanks for that

2017.51 --> 2020.919
goodtimz for all interesting

2065.04 --> 2074.82
yeah Hagrid can you please stop it

2068.73 --> 2076.44
you're not helping anyone if you really

2074.82 --> 2079.9190000000003
think you're a slave why don't you just

2076.44 --> 2080.76
brand it on your forehead stop talking

2079.919 --> 2084.1389999999997
about this [ __ ]

2080.76 --> 2084.139
because it's not helping anyone

2090.0 --> 2093.23
[Music]

2098.69 --> 2105.14
I'm not a slave and I don't give a [ __ ]

2101.329 --> 2107.78
about why I am inevitably supposed to be

2105.14 --> 2110.5099999999998
like everyone else and we are all just

2107.78 --> 2112.94
freaking puppets of Satan if I continue

2110.51 --> 2116.23
if I keep on hearing this [ __ ] I'm gonna

2112.94 --> 2121.96
time you out because I don't want that

2116.23 --> 2121.96
crap in my chat thank you

2132.0 --> 2135.51
especially now

2161.2 --> 2165.0299999999997
yeah I think it is

2168.0 --> 2171.179
[Music]

2195.95 --> 2203.109
yeah yeah I'm just plucking my tangerine

2200.66 --> 2203.109
here

2213.159 --> 2220.099
so let's get to some subject okay

2217.879 --> 2223.519
good temper all said earlier he's been

2220.099 --> 2227.3590000000004
managing to change the measured weight

2223.519 --> 2230.7389999999996
with electrostatics that's kind of

2227.359 --> 2230.739
interesting how that works

2248.81 --> 2253.04
are you okay Rasta

2282.319 --> 2301.849
now Trish bliss a poppy is not an Omega

2285.89 --> 2305.019
don't be crude why do people always want

2301.849 --> 2308.6890000000003
to find some kind of new scale and

2305.019 --> 2312.229
they're gonna refer somebody to why do

2308.689 --> 2315.0789999999997
ad does everyone always pick the very

2312.229 --> 2316.64
very very very worst option just

2315.079 --> 2319.549
casually with anyone

2316.64 --> 2322.189
why didn't you actually point at the

2319.549 --> 2325.429
right scale so why do it doesn't always

2322.189 --> 2328.4289999999996
have to be the worst one you figured out

2325.429 --> 2335.419
was there why does everybody always do

2328.429 --> 2337.9
that Zep tepi is not an Omega don't be

2335.419 --> 2337.9
ridiculous

2339.13 --> 2344.109
he wouldn't be in my chat if he was

2350.54 --> 2360.5
oh you'd citation you want the citation

2358.43 --> 2363.7
for that why don't you go and look it up

2360.5 --> 2366.64
on the news because I'm pretty sure that

2363.7 --> 2370.46
Facebook and Google and YouTube are

2366.64 --> 2374.18
blocking huge amounts of advertisement

2370.46 --> 2376.73
and video and viewership and that's all

2374.18 --> 2378.95
just gross product to them and they're

2376.73 --> 2381.68
literally cutting it away for political

2378.95 --> 2384.4399999999996
reasons and it's not a little it's huge

2381.68 --> 2386.93
amounts and it's all over the news all

2384.44 --> 2391.0
over the alternative news it's not gonna

2386.93 --> 2393.47
be said on CNN or maybe they would be

2391.0 --> 2396.65
gleefully joking about it or something

2393.47 --> 2399.91
I don't know but yeah they are losing

2396.65 --> 2399.9100000000003
money it's just palpable

2408.64 --> 2415.5499999999997
every time they de monetize a channel

2411.53 --> 2417.92
every time they revoke super chat

2415.55 --> 2422.75
capability every time they do that every

2417.92 --> 2426.08
time they lose money okay and the

2422.75 --> 2429.97
individual feels like oh no something's

2426.08 --> 2434.96
being taken away well imagine that with

2429.97 --> 2437.5299999999997
millions of people around the world yeah

2434.96 --> 2437.53
that's a lot

2440.16 --> 2453.96
oh dear what oh my god okay if that's

2452.31 --> 2457.17
true that's one hell of a conspiracy

2453.96 --> 2461.34
theory there at rest I have are you

2457.17 --> 2468.09
saying that the u.s. government is

2461.34 --> 2469.9500000000003
basically making up for the damages that

2468.09 --> 2475.5
Google is suffering because of their own

2469.95 --> 2479.22
political censorship if you can actually

2475.5 --> 2481.86
put down a solid traceable structure for

2479.22 --> 2485.85
that that'd be one hell of a conspiracy

2481.86 --> 2491.76
theory that would be absurdly outrageous

2485.85 --> 2493.65
so it would be nice yeah it would be but

2491.76 --> 2496.44
you don't have it yet it's just

2493.65 --> 2501.09
something you say you I haven't seen any

2496.44 --> 2503.87
any actual confirmation there it's just

2501.09 --> 2503.8700000000003
you saying it

2508.46 --> 2513.2
play but if you can get me more info on

2511.22 --> 2518.41
that that would be interesting

2513.2 --> 2518.41
and I've downturn to David if you please

2521.83 --> 2528.4
hello provision pirate and what

2525.1 --> 2528.4
mozzarellas missed

2590.18 --> 2593.37
[Applause]

2604.32 --> 2607.449
[Music]

2708.64 --> 2719.87
how did Thanks

2714.71 --> 2725.12
thank you Major Tom I was trying to

2719.87 --> 2726.98
respond to the Veritas expose about

2725.12 --> 2730.48
Google that proficient pirate was

2726.98 --> 2733.82
bringing up and I have followed that

2730.48 --> 2735.98
also through Infowars but before that

2733.82 --> 2737.63
through the Veritas revelation and all

2735.98 --> 2740.33
that and it was pretty good and it's

2737.63 --> 2743.78
also pretty damning and but then again

2740.33 --> 2748.88
it to me what all of this has shown is

2743.78 --> 2751.3700000000003
that Google is so freaking large it's

2748.88 --> 2754.73
not even really a unified company

2751.37 --> 2759.2799999999997
anymore it's just so it's just a machine

2754.73 --> 2762.5
with a lot of operators and it's not so

2759.28 --> 2764.3900000000003
centralized as you would think so there

2762.5 --> 2766.04
is probably gonna be some cleaning up

2764.39 --> 2767.5099999999998
one way or the other but I don't know

2766.04 --> 2769.37
how long it's gonna take and if it's

2767.51 --> 2772.0400000000004
gonna be fully effective at all that

2769.37 --> 2776.6
that's what I think but I've predicted

2772.04 --> 2779.72
that I've predicted that YouTube and

2776.6 --> 2781.43
Google would get into big trouble that

2779.72 --> 2783.29
they're politicization would at some

2781.43 --> 2786.8199999999997
point come to an end and that they would

2783.29 --> 2791.36
potentially be broken up into smaller

2786.82 --> 2795.79
local yeah utilities that are there who

2791.36 --> 2798.59
might become nationalized in that sense

2795.79 --> 2801.49
but I don't know yet how it's gonna play

2798.59 --> 2801.4900000000002
out exactly

2838.85 --> 2841.54
who

2846.26 --> 2852.07
weird or colored I don't know about that

2862.46 --> 2865.18
what

2868.11 --> 2875.61
okay when was that okay you're dumping a

2873.15 --> 2878.4900000000002
lot of data here in my chat would be

2875.61 --> 2881.57
nice to actually have some actual link

2878.49 --> 2881.5699999999997
[Music]

2881.99 --> 2886.2
is it did you post it on your YouTube

2885.42 --> 2889.16
channel

2886.2 --> 2889.16
mark colored

2901.15 --> 2907.619
hmm google forgot about its do no evil

2904.66 --> 2912.1499999999996
policy now I think they are just

2907.619 --> 2912.15
expressing it in doublespeak

2926.3 --> 2929.51
[Applause]

3054.79 --> 3062.59
oh gods now it's done now they no longer

3059.32 --> 3064.3
want to be my friends because I asked

3062.59 --> 3068.01
them to stop doing something and that's

3064.3 --> 3068.01
intolerable of course

3082.12 --> 3089.8599999999997
no I'm not gonna put my shirt on today

3086.75 --> 3089.86

3151.099 --> 3159.8900000000003
oh you think you think it is why don't

3157.94 --> 3161.869
you go report it then if that's really

3159.89 --> 3163.999
true I don't want to do anything illegal

3161.869 --> 3164.63
and I basically put it up there as a

3163.999 --> 3167.39
joke

3164.63 --> 3169.9990000000003
nobody's ever done anything with it all

3167.39 --> 3174.199
so I hand out and retract wrenches at

3169.999 --> 3179.5589999999997

good for you night angel he's really hot

3259.73 --> 3266.6
here even with this I'm still sweating

3262.49 --> 3271.99
just from the heat okay so yeah it's

3266.6 --> 3271.99
really hot here it's not a joke

3313.82 --> 3316.9990000000003
[Music]

3322.1 --> 3341.68
hot I don't know how hot okay it's

3337.46 --> 3345.59
supposedly 29 degrees Celsius right here

3341.68 --> 3368.12
so I'd say it's probably around 30 in

3345.59 --> 3370.3700000000003
here that's just estimation anyway I'm

3368.12 --> 3373.8199999999997
gonna round out the yeah I need the

3370.37 --> 3376.31
narco well there's a lot of things I

3373.82 --> 3379.73
could use Arcos not exactly on my

3376.31 --> 3382.19
priority list but could be kind of nice

3379.73 --> 3384.38
although it's the Netherlands when are

3382.19 --> 3387.2200000000003
you ever going to use that maybe one

3384.38 --> 3387.2200000000003
month in the year

3392.77 --> 3400.98
now it's 29 degrees Celsius not

3397.06 --> 3400.98
Fahrenheit don't be silly

3415.46 --> 3421.55
right anyway I'm gonna round out the

3417.77 --> 3423.859
show because yep I'm gonna round out the

3421.55 --> 3426.7400000000002
show and I kind of need to get out of

3423.859 --> 3430.5499999999997
here and find cooler grounds because

3426.74 --> 3434.2999999999997
it's just way too hot in here and yeah

3430.55 --> 3436.3390000000004
I'm kind of running out Juice talked

3434.3 --> 3440.42
about pretty much everything that's

3436.339 --> 3442.069
going on except Flat Earth of course the

3440.42 --> 3443.78
best time to talk about that when you

3442.069 --> 3447.109
can talk about all the squabbling and

3443.78 --> 3448.849
all the arguments and people trying to

3447.109 --> 3452.48
manipulate the [ __ ] out of each other
