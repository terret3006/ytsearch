165.519 --> 168.959
eerie

166.48 --> 171.44
because there was just no wind

168.959 --> 172.959
and it's not pleasant

171.44 --> 175.2
when it's that hot and there's no wind

172.959 --> 176.959
at all but now it's back and yeah it's

175.2 --> 180.35999999999999

213.28 --> 219.0
saturday 80th 23rd of july 2022.

219.2 --> 226.28
temperature is

221.519 --> 226.28
24 degrees celsius over here

231.12 --> 234.159
feeling

232.08 --> 238.31900000000002
okay i'm feeling good i had a bit of a

234.159 --> 238.319
rough night last night because i

238.799 --> 243.36
went through another weird thing again

241.76 --> 247.28
and this time

243.36 --> 249.59900000000002
i actually poisoned myself with sugar

247.28 --> 253.28
i i was

249.599 --> 256.0
i just had weird craving for candy

253.28 --> 258.799
but i just i don't know why i did that i

256.0 --> 261.04
literally i ate of it

258.799 --> 263.12
almost like i was a little kid but yeah

261.04 --> 265.44
that doesn't work anymore i win you

263.12 --> 270.32
should know better than that

265.44 --> 272.479
and yeah i literally got sick of it

270.32 --> 274.8
to the point where i could throw up just

272.479 --> 278.479
what the [ __ ]

274.8 --> 279.44
i had a lot of sleep being kind of ill

278.479 --> 280.88
but

279.44 --> 283.04
because of just

280.88 --> 285.36
sugar poisoning and i literally feel

283.04 --> 287.52000000000004
like the

285.36 --> 288.72
what's it called that certain type of

287.52 --> 290.79999999999995
fungi

288.72 --> 293.04
that typically responds to sugar i

290.8 --> 295.44
literally can feel it in my system now

293.04 --> 297.04
that it i feel kind of stupid for having

295.44 --> 300.0
done this

297.04 --> 302.24
but i will get rid of it

300.0 --> 302.24
and

304.47 --> 308.47900000000004
[Music]

306.4 --> 312.79999999999995
weird

308.479 --> 315.12
so me and my weird impulses sometimes

312.8 --> 315.12
ah

317.6 --> 323.199
glad that heat wave is gone for you guys

322.16 --> 325.199
where

323.199 --> 327.36
because i think tomorrow it's gonna get

325.199 --> 330.0
really hot again over here

327.36 --> 332.16
it's like back to 29 degrees

330.0 --> 336.0
something like that

332.16 --> 338.40000000000003
so it's not entirely over but look

336.0 --> 340.08
the summer heat and all it's just coming

338.4 --> 342.15999999999997
and going

340.08 --> 345.28
like we had a full day of rain in

342.16 --> 347.199
between this is a very good summer

345.28 --> 348.71999999999997
so far

347.199 --> 350.40000000000003
so

348.72 --> 352.32000000000005
like i wouldn't even really call it a

350.4 --> 355.039
heat wave we just had a couple of really

352.32 --> 356.319
hot days but like those hot days didn't

355.039 --> 357.52
like last

356.319 --> 359.44
a week

357.52 --> 360.71999999999997
right where everything just dries out

359.44 --> 362.8
and [ __ ]

360.72 --> 365.36
and even in the netherlands the water

362.8 --> 369.12
shortage might then arrive but that's

365.36 --> 369.12
not happening and i'm glad of it

370.24 --> 374.56
average temperatures and overcast ah

372.319 --> 378.47900000000004
nice right so you got kind of the

374.56 --> 378.479
weather that i had yesterday

379.039 --> 381.84
nice

387.68 --> 393.36
munchies are my f yeah clutch

390.4 --> 396.479
i never do that

393.36 --> 399.44
but yesterday i was just weird i

396.479 --> 401.84
fell asleep like really early

399.44 --> 405.039
like i don't know why i just like really

401.84 --> 405.039
fell asleep woke up

406.8 --> 409.84000000000003
pretty late

410.08 --> 414.71999999999997
and then i got like sick from it

412.72 --> 417.28000000000003
it's weird because it's almost like

414.72 --> 420.24
alcohol poisoning like i had with like

417.28 --> 421.52
the freaking absent bottle thing that i

420.24 --> 424.0
yeah i

421.52 --> 426.71999999999997
put it down the drain so that's not

424.0 --> 429.039
going to happen but it's

426.72 --> 431.59900000000005
alcohol poisoning sugar poisoning it

429.039 --> 434.4
seems just very similar how the system

431.599 --> 434.4
responds to it

434.56 --> 439.84
it's weird

437.68 --> 442.8
but like this something like this hadn't

439.84 --> 442.79999999999995
happened to me in

442.96 --> 448.08
a long time like since 2008

446.16 --> 450.8
because i'm always extremely careful

448.08 --> 453.599
with candy

450.8 --> 457.199
i just don't know why why i

453.599 --> 457.199
felt like that was a good idea

459.44 --> 462.44
anyhow

464.16 --> 468.639
chocolate isn't it yeah it wasn't

466.0 --> 473.72
chocolate no i wouldn't do that

468.639 --> 473.72
god no i don't eat chocolate anymore

479.759 --> 486.0
now it was actually just like weird salt

483.12 --> 486.0
dutch candy

487.68 --> 491.68
but i took

488.8 --> 494.16
a certain type that is just really that

491.68 --> 497.28000000000003
was not a good idea because there's like

494.16 --> 500.639
a lot of just bad sugar in it and that

497.28 --> 502.15999999999997
was stupid i was just seduced by my

500.639 --> 504.639
childish

502.16 --> 506.96000000000004
sugar greedy mind

504.639 --> 508.639
then that doesn't normally happen

506.96 --> 512.24
so i'm a bit embarrassed about it and

508.639 --> 514.479
i'm not gonna let that happen again

512.24 --> 514.479
uh

515.279 --> 519.159
hello iron 26.

526.48 --> 528.72
right

529.92 --> 535.8
but yeah i barely ate anything because

532.48 --> 535.8000000000001
of all that

536.399 --> 541.76
so but yeah i do have some food stuck in

539.279 --> 543.68
the fridge so i think i'm gonna just do

541.76 --> 546.399
my best to

543.68 --> 549.3599999999999
take it easy today and just eat well and

546.399 --> 550.8
just lay off any kind of like sugar or

549.36 --> 553.279
whatever

550.8 --> 556.24
including like the uh

553.279 --> 558.64
ice creams i got it's not cream i got

556.24 --> 561.76
like watery ice

558.64 --> 563.519
organic versions but even those

561.76 --> 566.16
are like sweet and they're not a good

563.519 --> 568.0
idea i just need to like avoid sugar now

566.16 --> 570.0799999999999
even harder than normal

568.0 --> 572.32
and i am usually like completely

570.08 --> 575.32
sugarless

572.32 --> 575.32
uh

577.92 --> 581.519
hello dart good to see you

581.76 --> 586.3199999999999
oh you guys are certainly

584.16 --> 587.92
more active today than yesterday but it

586.32 --> 591.36
is an hour later so

587.92 --> 593.279
make sense i got another

591.36 --> 595.92
freeze

593.279 --> 597.6
these are cooled

595.92 --> 601.0
loving it

597.6 --> 601.0
what an invention

604.37 --> 607.419
[Music]

619.68 --> 624.7199999999999
all right so yeah i was watching my show

621.839 --> 626.399
back actually before this

624.72 --> 632.519
and i was kind of

626.399 --> 632.519
astounded if i say so myself in how well

633.76 --> 639.76
what i did was put down

636.8 --> 642.0
i got a couple of like snap aggression

639.76 --> 643.76
where i just got too loud for the mic

642.0 --> 646.399
and that's annoying

643.76 --> 649.4399999999999
because it's like i

646.399 --> 649.44
it's just difficult

649.68 --> 655.1999999999999
like how do i do that i need to like

652.0 --> 655.92
somehow face the camera but like

655.2 --> 658.32
they

655.92 --> 660.8
face away from the mic because i get

658.32 --> 660.8000000000001
louder

661.36 --> 664.64
i get really freaking loud when i do

663.76 --> 667.04
that

664.64 --> 670.04
and the mic can't handle it

667.04 --> 670.04
this

675.04 --> 679.5999999999999
but yeah i have like a tendency when i

676.959 --> 681.04
get really teeth grinding angry in a

679.6 --> 684.16
second

681.04 --> 685.8389999999999
to like give off these sonic explosions

684.16 --> 688.56
where i literally just build pressure in

685.839 --> 690.8800000000001
my lungs and then just

688.56 --> 690.88
right

691.2 --> 696.8000000000001
but yeah i made sense i watched it back

694.079 --> 701.88
it made sense everything i said it made

696.8 --> 701.88
sense and i'm holding my ground with it

702.399 --> 708.959
like i am starting to now feel the

705.44 --> 708.9590000000001
cohesion in it

712.24 --> 715.24
right

718.05 --> 724.0
[Music]

720.72 --> 725.9300000000001
and i'm curious as to like

724.0 --> 728.24
how is this going to be picked up

725.93 --> 730.7199999999999
[Music]

728.24 --> 733.04
i've kind of already by the way

730.72 --> 736.8000000000001
seen or heard other people

733.04 --> 736.8
start to talk like this as well

737.36 --> 741.6
although not as fanatical as i do i

740.16 --> 744.959
think

741.6 --> 748.16
not like full on loud and all that but

744.959 --> 751.5189999999999
there's people that are like yeah

748.16 --> 752.48
we kind of are already in a civil war

751.519 --> 753.279
and

752.48 --> 754.72
like

753.279 --> 757.04
this

754.72 --> 759.6
we need to fight and if you don't you're

757.04 --> 762.56
in big trouble and like you can't

759.6 --> 764.639
downplay it you can't you can't almost

762.56 --> 766.959
can't play this one safe

764.639 --> 770.88
like and the amount of room

766.959 --> 773.4399999999999
to even play it safe is slowly

770.88 --> 776.8
slowly retracting

773.44 --> 779.44
like the edge of a cliff that's just

776.8 --> 781.92
like the trembles are making pieces

779.44 --> 784.639
fall off and more and there's just less

781.92 --> 787.04
room to stand on there

784.639 --> 788.88
and play it safe like it's going to

787.04 --> 792.16
eventually just crumble and everything

788.88 --> 792.16
on is it's going to fall so

794.959 --> 797.68
hey rig back

799.6 --> 802.72
not a fan of the heat

807.12 --> 809.839
where are you at

813.6 --> 818.639
hello by the way neil degrasse tyson

815.44 --> 818.639
lies good to see you

825.36 --> 830.639
ah north virginia in yeah the united

827.519 --> 833.8
states is hot

830.639 --> 833.8
a lot

837.66 --> 840.929
[Music]

857.04 --> 861.04
oh nice derek

859.12 --> 862.48
you got a couple of cool days out there

861.04 --> 866.279
that's good

862.48 --> 866.279
i'm glad for you

872.079 --> 876.3199999999999
make sure to make full use of it right

876.639 --> 880.32
i mean

877.76 --> 882.399
i guess there it like it's in india

880.32 --> 886.1600000000001
where you are or was it cashmere it's

882.399 --> 887.76
now time to like work outside

886.16 --> 891.04
while it's still

887.76 --> 891.04
that good type of temperature

893.519 --> 898.16
because you don't have to face the heat

895.279 --> 900.88
now when you work outside

898.16 --> 902.8
so you got to use that time

900.88 --> 904.959
especially if you're like a farmer there

902.8 --> 904.959
or

906.72 --> 910.44
or on an orchard

924.88 --> 927.8389999999999
what

928.32 --> 932.9200000000001
i have no idea what you're talking about

929.92 --> 932.92
clutch

952.639 --> 958.409
right jared yeah good

955.22 --> 958.409
[Music]

980.8 --> 983.8389999999999
right anyway

988.399 --> 992.639
watched another hollywood movie

990.32 --> 996.36
yesterday also in the night

992.639 --> 996.36
before i got sick

997.04 --> 1002.959
i thought was entertaining it might also

999.36 --> 1006.639
be just the sugar though

1002.959 --> 1011.399
but i watched the gray man

1006.639 --> 1011.399
a bunch of assassins and all that

1011.44 --> 1014.72
but

1013.519 --> 1017.6
the main

1014.72 --> 1020.88
actors were really interesting

1017.6 --> 1023.12
like it had captain america as the main

1020.88 --> 1025.52
villain opponent and he was

1023.12 --> 1028.0
like really good

1025.52 --> 1030.319
like really good man

1028.0 --> 1032.959
it was so good that you'd like

1030.319 --> 1036.559
you knew he was a freaking psycho

1032.959 --> 1036.559
but it was still just so

1036.839 --> 1043.76
impressive that just you can't help but

1039.839 --> 1043.76
like him it was that was like

1045.28 --> 1051.36
really well acted i thought that movie

1049.12 --> 1052.799
it was all [ __ ] up and

1051.36 --> 1054.0
just

1052.799 --> 1055.44
yeah

1054.0 --> 1059.039
spy [ __ ]

1055.44 --> 1062.0800000000002
cia and cia contractors and rogue and

1059.039 --> 1064.4
blind secret programs and blah blah blah

1062.08 --> 1066.8799999999999
you know how that goes

1064.4 --> 1069.919
but the actors like did a really good

1066.88 --> 1071.919
job i like i really did like the main

1069.919 --> 1074.7990000000002
actor

1071.919 --> 1077.1200000000001
the hero the protagonist but i also like

1074.799 --> 1079.2
the opponent was really interesting and

1077.12 --> 1081.36
there were all kinds of interesting

1079.2 --> 1084.0
there was like this i think a pretty

1081.36 --> 1086.559
famous indian actor

1084.0 --> 1087.679
that was like the last

1086.559 --> 1089.2
opponent

1087.679 --> 1090.799
but

1089.2 --> 1095.24
and he like almost defeated the

1090.799 --> 1095.24
protagonist but then

1095.44 --> 1099.52
yeah

1096.96 --> 1101.6000000000001
he basically sort of said like yeah i'm

1099.52 --> 1104.4
out these people have no honor i thought

1101.6 --> 1107.039
it was like pretty cool

1104.4 --> 1109.8400000000001
i don't know i yeah

1107.039 --> 1109.84
it's odd

1111.36 --> 1114.9599999999998
to get a movie like that

1113.44 --> 1117.919
that just

1114.96 --> 1117.919
seemed so good

1118.0 --> 1122.559
and the action was very well

1120.32 --> 1124.96
choreographed and all that so was the

1122.559 --> 1126.24
real action spy

1124.96 --> 1129.3600000000001
thriller

1126.24 --> 1131.2
yeah spy action movie type thing

1129.36 --> 1136.1999999999998
they're great man probably a lot of

1131.2 --> 1136.2
people already know it i hadn't seen it

1136.88 --> 1139.8400000000001
so watch that

1143.28 --> 1148.9189999999999
wrestling is more real than the what are

1145.44 --> 1148.919
you talking about

1158.08 --> 1162.08
what

1159.44 --> 1164.64
my cable car oh so you'd travel up the

1162.08 --> 1167.1999999999998
mountain with the cable car

1164.64 --> 1167.2
interesting

1173.919 --> 1179.2800000000002
you've got a sextant question for me

1177.28 --> 1182.08
20 say why for me

1179.28 --> 1184.799
but okay i'll try to answer it just

1182.08 --> 1186.96
realize i am not the most mechanically

1184.799 --> 1188.559
apt to everything i know the raw

1186.96 --> 1192.88
principles but

1188.559 --> 1195.12
like 10th man and

1192.88 --> 1197.44
john

1195.12 --> 1199.84
and brian are really the ones that are

1197.44 --> 1202.48
just freaking reading the manuals all

1199.84 --> 1203.6
the way i'm not doing it okay i'm just

1202.48 --> 1205.76
trying to

1203.6 --> 1207.84
get a framework understanding which is

1205.76 --> 1210.48
how i basically assimilate all the

1207.84 --> 1210.48
information

1210.96 --> 1215.2
wrestling is pro wrestling okay

1219.2 --> 1224.2
how are you bringing this up what are

1220.72 --> 1224.2
you talking about

1234.32 --> 1239.4399999999998
elevation angle doesn't change it should

1237.039 --> 1239.44
go up

1243.84 --> 1246.9189999999999
all right

1249.44 --> 1251.919
i think

1252.96 --> 1256.96
[Music]

1254.799 --> 1258.0
i mean

1256.96 --> 1261.3600000000001
look the

1258.0 --> 1264.08
the celestial demisphere is simply just

1261.36 --> 1265.84
like a bubble that virtually surrounds

1264.08 --> 1268.3999999999999
you if you're gonna go up it's gonna go

1265.84 --> 1268.3999999999999
up with you

1268.48 --> 1271.88
that's it

1282.559 --> 1288.08
that's almost supernatural right what

1287.039 --> 1291.84
guys

1288.08 --> 1291.84
what the hell are you talking about

1303.919 --> 1309.3200000000002
rick beck who are you having this

1305.52 --> 1309.32
conversation with

1321.28 --> 1325.2
the angles to the celestials does not

1323.12 --> 1329.039
change as you go however

1325.2 --> 1332.0800000000002
okay yeah but that's not supernatural

1329.039 --> 1334.72
no if it was

1332.08 --> 1336.0
supernatural

1334.72 --> 1339.44
[Music]

1336.0 --> 1342.72
then you wouldn't have any physical

1339.44 --> 1345.76
measurable traits

1342.72 --> 1347.919
right supernatural is information like

1345.76 --> 1351.52
that's the things that we get out of it

1347.919 --> 1351.5200000000002
information is supernatural

1352.24 --> 1355.52
like

1353.039 --> 1357.679
structure within information could be

1355.52 --> 1360.24
considered supernatural but

1357.679 --> 1362.799
what we see the celestials that is

1360.24 --> 1366.159
technically not supernatural it is

1362.799 --> 1369.039
holographic but yeah light

1366.159 --> 1370.96
still falls under natural even though we

1369.039 --> 1373.84
don't understand how

1370.96 --> 1375.039
non-local holograms are naturally

1373.84 --> 1377.6
created

1375.039 --> 1380.08
we don't get that part

1377.6 --> 1382.6399999999999
it's not supernatural because it's

1380.08 --> 1382.6399999999999
measurable

1383.039 --> 1388.72
right supernatural things

1385.84 --> 1392.24
you can't measure it

1388.72 --> 1394.0
right it has no numerical value to so

1392.24 --> 1399.72
new supernatural things don't have

1394.0 --> 1399.72
numerical order to them you see

1416.159 --> 1420.64
but it's surreal maybe that's

1419.2 --> 1423.1200000000001
that's the word you were actually

1420.64 --> 1424.5590000000002
looking for it's surreal that is true

1423.12 --> 1427.36
like to the experience and the

1424.559 --> 1430.32
realization as to like with this thing

1427.36 --> 1432.24
this non-local holographic bubble of

1430.32 --> 1436.32
celestials that is just literally

1432.24 --> 1436.32
following you around uniformly

1436.48 --> 1440.559
to realize that is freaking surreal it

1438.799 --> 1442.799
is weird

1440.559 --> 1444.559
and you could say wow it's a miracle of

1442.799 --> 1446.559
god but

1444.559 --> 1451.52
it's not

1446.559 --> 1451.52
physics based supernatural you see

1451.76 --> 1456.08
because it is

1453.2 --> 1458.0800000000002
palpable there is literal light there

1456.08 --> 1461.12
and it does things it has a physical

1458.08 --> 1462.6399999999999
interaction it's measurable you can

1461.12 --> 1464.8799999999999
quantify it

1462.64 --> 1468.64
so it's not

1464.88 --> 1472.7990000000002
supernatural in a physics

1468.64 --> 1475.76
uh in the physical in the physics field

1472.799 --> 1475.76
go with that right

1475.84 --> 1480.559
sorry for being a nitpicky about this

1478.32 --> 1484.0
but yeah the words do really matter i'm

1480.559 --> 1487.76
because it is i am really trying to

1484.0 --> 1489.279
keep my cosmogeny as physics based as i

1487.76 --> 1491.039
can and

1489.279 --> 1494.88
like even though things like the

1491.039 --> 1496.24
non-local holographic celestials

1494.88 --> 1498.88
like

1496.24 --> 1501.039
i can't just claim what they are within

1498.88 --> 1503.1200000000001
physics because i i don't know how to

1501.039 --> 1504.8799999999999
very manipulate it

1503.12 --> 1508.4799999999998
but

1504.88 --> 1511.279
at least i can get the analysis of them

1508.48 --> 1512.48
and the what is is

1511.279 --> 1515.36
right

1512.48 --> 1516.4
in accordance to the structure of

1515.36 --> 1518.559
physics

1516.4 --> 1521.279
and that's what i'm trying to do as much

1518.559 --> 1522.3999999999999
as i can it's pretty difficult

1521.279 --> 1525.44
but yeah

1522.4 --> 1528.72
look whenever i try out something

1525.44 --> 1531.52
over at the guys on fed

1528.72 --> 1533.2
then they will actually really refine it

1531.52 --> 1535.36
for me they do test me and my

1533.2 --> 1538.0800000000002
understanding of it and that's how we

1535.36 --> 1541.08
learn a lot of it

1538.08 --> 1541.08
okay

1552.72 --> 1556.96
yeah derpcon 3 but don't paid attention

1555.6 --> 1560.32
just

1556.96 --> 1560.32
let's keep it on track

1566.64 --> 1571.6000000000001
it's the only thing that acts like that

1569.279 --> 1573.2
well rick beck

1571.6 --> 1576.9599999999998
for the most part

1573.2 --> 1578.0
right but there is such things as weird

1576.96 --> 1582.559
like

1578.0 --> 1582.559
mirror holograms and all that

1583.2 --> 1587.44
right

1585.039 --> 1590.24
i mean there i can bet that there are

1587.44 --> 1593.52
ways that you can literally be in a very

1590.24 --> 1595.52
special type of mirror room

1593.52 --> 1599.12
where

1595.52 --> 1601.76
a non-local hologram through that entire

1599.12 --> 1604.559
place could be potentially created where

1601.76 --> 1606.96
you like see sort of a light that just

1604.559 --> 1608.559
always seems to the observer like it's

1606.96 --> 1610.64
in an exact

1608.559 --> 1613.84
spot that moves with you i think they

1610.64 --> 1616.0
could probably emulate that

1613.84 --> 1618.72
right they could probably emulate the

1616.0 --> 1620.559
non-local hologram effect

1618.72 --> 1623.84
physically

1620.559 --> 1625.44
but that still doesn't make this that

1623.84 --> 1627.4399999999998
doesn't like prove the sun and the

1625.44 --> 1629.3600000000001
celestials right because

1627.44 --> 1631.76
fairly certain

1629.36 --> 1633.4399999999998
that the realm is not would not be

1631.76 --> 1636.1589999999999
shaped like

1633.44 --> 1637.76
well such a weird like bubble shaped

1636.159 --> 1639.1200000000001
hologram

1637.76 --> 1641.84
mirror

1639.12 --> 1643.039
place would be

1641.84 --> 1645.279
because i'm pretty sure it would be

1643.039 --> 1646.1589999999999
spherical in some way

1645.279 --> 1648.399
like

1646.159 --> 1650.72
and that's not the containment of the

1648.399 --> 1650.7199999999998
realm

1650.88 --> 1655.24
so yeah however that works

1655.52 --> 1658.8799999999999
non-local

1656.799 --> 1660.08
holographic

1658.88 --> 1662.96
traits

1660.08 --> 1665.279
could probably be emulated

1662.96 --> 1667.1200000000001
in a small way but

1665.279 --> 1670.48
to bring it to the level where you could

1667.12 --> 1672.399
literally emulate the entire celestial

1670.48 --> 1674.159
spectrum like with the stars and the

1672.399 --> 1675.6
moon and the sun

1674.159 --> 1678.48
and the planets

1675.6 --> 1680.8799999999999
and then actually have it be exactly

1678.48 --> 1683.3600000000001
like how we see it outside all non-local

1680.88 --> 1686.3200000000002
and surrounding you inside of this

1683.36 --> 1688.4799999999998
incredible room like i don't see that

1686.32 --> 1691.6
happening but dude

1688.48 --> 1693.52
it might be possible

1691.6 --> 1695.6789999999999
that some

1693.52 --> 1697.36
like

1695.679 --> 1699.44
optics

1697.36 --> 1702.32
guy engineer

1699.44 --> 1706.159
figures out how to emulate it like that

1702.32 --> 1708.1589999999999
it might be possible i can't exclude it

1706.159 --> 1709.679
that would seem very surreal to me

1708.159 --> 1712.48
though if somebody would actually

1709.679 --> 1715.3600000000001
accomplish that in full

1712.48 --> 1717.039
like in a passive setup right

1715.36 --> 1719.84
not where you're literally having

1717.039 --> 1720.8799999999999
screens surrounding you and it's just

1719.84 --> 1722.32
like oh

1720.88 --> 1725.1200000000001
we're just gonna

1722.32 --> 1726.72
emulate like it is and it's not local

1725.12 --> 1729.039
right it's just a bunch of screens now

1726.72 --> 1729.919
it would have to be like literal mirror

1729.039 --> 1731.039
type

1729.919 --> 1732.96
effect

1731.039 --> 1735.2
to cause lights

1732.96 --> 1737.679
to basically move with you

1735.2 --> 1738.799
it apparently

1737.679 --> 1741.3600000000001
and then

1738.799 --> 1743.9189999999999
you could potentially emulate all of the

1741.36 --> 1747.12
celestials but yeah god before you get

1743.919 --> 1750.0800000000002
to that point i don't know

1747.12 --> 1753.84
i can barely imagine that but i have

1750.08 --> 1753.84
like dreamed of that

1755.78 --> 1759.02
[Music]

1774.799 --> 1780.6
what the hell terry

1776.799 --> 1780.6
are you talking about

1789.44 --> 1794.64
yeah i would like to see that video too

1791.6 --> 1797.36
if anything that's probably like is just

1794.64 --> 1798.48
a weird video cut

1797.36 --> 1800.6399999999999
i mean

1798.48 --> 1803.6
what if like half the screen

1800.64 --> 1806.3990000000001
was just footage from like

1803.6 --> 1808.559
a minute before that

1806.399 --> 1811.279
that somehow just like

1808.559 --> 1814.24
remained bleeding over it so you might

1811.279 --> 1816.559
have just seen a cow just start floating

1814.24 --> 1819.36
and without its legs because the bottom

1816.559 --> 1820.32
part would have been bleeding over

1819.36 --> 1822.6399999999999
from

1820.32 --> 1826.24
earlier footage that like it could

1822.64 --> 1826.24
literally be a glitch like that

1826.64 --> 1831.3600000000001
it's very odd though

1829.36 --> 1833.6789999999999
but that's how i imagine something like

1831.36 --> 1835.76
that could happen there at 306 through

1833.679 --> 1837.8400000000001
bleeding

1835.76 --> 1841.279
bleeding

1837.84 --> 1844.399
right just like with the weird

1841.279 --> 1847.6
bleeding in the iss where suddenly like

1844.399 --> 1850.399
the people there like here they move out

1847.6 --> 1852.399
and then it becomes this weird

1850.399 --> 1854.2399999999998
all a mirrors

1852.399 --> 1856.08
surreal twisted

1854.24 --> 1858.48
thing that's bleeding that's image

1856.08 --> 1858.48
bleeding

1858.88 --> 1863.5700000000002
it's like the data from

1861.679 --> 1865.1200000000001
previous

1863.57 --> 1866.72
[Music]

1865.12 --> 1868.6399999999999
from previous

1866.72 --> 1871.84
film material

1868.64 --> 1874.48
refuses to go away it's like the new

1871.84 --> 1875.76
footage from that location is not

1874.48 --> 1878.0
properly

1875.76 --> 1880.559
loading and replacing the earth and that

1878.0 --> 1882.32
then how you get bleeding

1880.559 --> 1885.32
so it might be that terrible three or

1882.32 --> 1885.32
six

1894.559 --> 1898.08
i think it's called bleeding i don't

1896.08 --> 1900.0
know

1898.08 --> 1902.399
video bleeding i don't know i i don't

1900.0 --> 1904.64
know why i think it may be just just

1902.399 --> 1906.4799999999998
distortion but

1904.64 --> 1907.1200000000001
yeah i've seen that happen that could be

1906.48 --> 1909.519
it

1907.12 --> 1912.08
you think that might be a terror 306 was

1909.519 --> 1914.559
there any other visible like weird color

1912.08 --> 1919.48
distortion going on as well

1914.559 --> 1919.48
usually a compass knees such effects

1932.08 --> 1936.0
i have no

1933.76 --> 1937.919
what are you suggesting jared

1936.0 --> 1939.44
are you saying this ghost cows or

1937.919 --> 1941.76
something like what are you talking

1939.44 --> 1941.76
about

1947.44 --> 1954.76
this is a very weird thing to bring up

1951.76 --> 1954.76
derek

1965.84 --> 1969.76
things materialize out of nowhere

1971.76 --> 1975.039
okay well maybe they went to the cow

1973.6 --> 1976.8799999999999
dimension

1975.039 --> 1980.24
and pop back out

1976.88 --> 1980.24
dude who knows man

1983.2 --> 1988.72
i mean yeah this falls kind of like

1985.44 --> 1991.6000000000001
under the leprechaun fairy category

1988.72 --> 1994.72
but i think that there is

1991.6 --> 1995.84
a decent chance however surreal it might

1994.72 --> 1997.6000000000001
seem

1995.84 --> 1999.12
that

1997.6 --> 2000.8799999999999
animals

1999.12 --> 2002.7199999999998
maybe even people

2000.88 --> 2005.2
can potentially

2002.72 --> 2008.32
when the opportunity arises which has to

2005.2 --> 2010.0800000000002
be like a conjunction of energies

2008.32 --> 2013.279
where they can literally just like

2010.08 --> 2017.84
escape physical space

2013.279 --> 2020.399
and like go to their own sub dimension

2017.84 --> 2020.399
literally

2021.519 --> 2025.519
or

2022.48 --> 2028.3990000000001
they were literally hologram cows

2025.519 --> 2028.3990000000001
just what the [ __ ]

2029.039 --> 2034.24
you got to check in those dutch what are

2031.279 --> 2034.24
you talking about

2042.96 --> 2048.56
that cow jumping dimension

2046.32 --> 2050.7999999999997
yeah

2048.56 --> 2052.96
like in diablo

2050.8 --> 2054.5600000000004
there's a cow dimension

2052.96 --> 2057.28
it's like their

2054.56 --> 2060.56
micro heaven i don't know this is really

2057.28 --> 2062.96
silly guys i know it sounds silly i i'm

2060.56 --> 2064.639
improvising here it's like

2062.96 --> 2067.52
i don't think it would be weird if if

2064.639 --> 2067.52
such things happen

2068.639 --> 2073.44
it'd be like sort of a spiritual

2071.839 --> 2076.7999999999997
trait

2073.44 --> 2079.76
that i think animals might possess

2076.8 --> 2081.76
and we just don't see it

2079.76 --> 2083.2000000000003
we we don't

2081.76 --> 2085.679
realize it

2083.2 --> 2088.56
our presence might block it

2085.679 --> 2091.28
right

2088.56 --> 2094.32
who knows what happens with animals when

2091.28 --> 2094.32
we're not looking

2100.32 --> 2107.599
i mean i see animals deep dreaming a lot

2104.96 --> 2109.92
well if they deep dream

2107.599 --> 2113.119
there's a chance that they have

2109.92 --> 2115.52
just like myself and people that have

2113.119 --> 2118.2400000000002
opened up their senses to it they might

2115.52 --> 2120.4
have extra dimensional activities

2118.24 --> 2123.359
in the spirit realm

2120.4 --> 2126.56
and that might even branch on into like

2123.359 --> 2126.56
a physical effect

2126.72 --> 2130.7999999999997
right

2127.68 --> 2134.48
i mean i can't say for sure that when i

2130.8 --> 2135.3590000000004
went into the dark world in between time

2134.48 --> 2138.32
that

2135.359 --> 2140.56
i was literally just in the physical

2138.32 --> 2142.2400000000002
world

2140.56 --> 2143.599
and that it happened in an instant i

2142.24 --> 2146.56
could have been that

2143.599 --> 2148.88
i literally was gone

2146.56 --> 2151.92
how do i know i don't know because

2148.88 --> 2155.599
nobody's ever like witnessed me

2151.92 --> 2159.32
when a dark world experience

2155.599 --> 2159.32
opens up to me

2161.359 --> 2165.119
it was never in the presence of somebody

2164.0 --> 2168.079
else

2165.119 --> 2168.079
except for like

2171.44 --> 2177.52
uh yeah

2174.079 --> 2177.52
in when i was 17.

2179.92 --> 2186.56
and maybe when i was younger too but

2182.8 --> 2186.5600000000004
it's just so weird like

2187.44 --> 2192.079
so yeah now i made it really weird

2189.68 --> 2192.0789999999997
thanks

2198.72 --> 2202.24
i usually kept

2200.4 --> 2204.7200000000003
like to keep these sort of

2202.24 --> 2207.2
thoughts more

2204.72 --> 2210.72
more fenced in

2207.2 --> 2210.72
more carefully defined

2211.119 --> 2214.96
right

2212.48 --> 2217.2
but i mean i would be a person that if i

2214.96 --> 2220.7200000000003
literally just like was watching and i'd

2217.2 --> 2223.2799999999997
see like cows or whatever and just like

2220.72 --> 2225.9199999999996
they're gone

2223.28 --> 2228.4
like just gone and then walk around and

2225.92 --> 2232.079
they're gone and then suddenly like

2228.4 --> 2234.7200000000003
back again i would be just like hmm

2232.079 --> 2236.32
i would not be like oh my god what just

2234.72 --> 2238.0
happened i would be like oh that's

2236.32 --> 2240.4
interesting

2238.0 --> 2240.4
okay

2241.04 --> 2245.7599999999998
let's see if that happens again

2243.599 --> 2247.92
and then something else no camera did

2245.76 --> 2250.48
not freeze

2247.92 --> 2250.48
elisee

2250.72 --> 2254.0
i was just sitting still

2254.079 --> 2257.48
that's all right

2259.04 --> 2264.72
who kids are those okay that's people

2262.079 --> 2264.7200000000003
outside

2264.96 --> 2272.0
kids playing there's a playground right

2268.0 --> 2273.599
there like 200 meters away

2272.0 --> 2276.599
behind the trees

2273.599 --> 2276.599
so

2290.88 --> 2297.6800000000003
you think those videos are bs okay

2294.96 --> 2299.44
why the [ __ ] did you bring it up then

2297.68 --> 2302.0789999999997
terret

2299.44 --> 2305.359
hey hey should i bring up

2302.079 --> 2307.8390000000004
nonsense videos that i've seen like 10

2305.359 --> 2309.839
years ago that were obviously fake

2307.839 --> 2312.0
should i bring it up as a mystery like

2309.839 --> 2314.0
oh

2312.0 --> 2315.839
look at this ridiculous thing that's

2314.0 --> 2317.599
obviously faked

2315.839 --> 2319.7599999999998
oh yes

2317.599 --> 2321.76
isn't that just special what could it be

2319.76 --> 2325.3590000000004
it might be some time traveler blah blah

2321.76 --> 2327.28
blah yeah oh why bring it up then

2325.359 --> 2331.2
if you already think that it was

2327.28 --> 2331.2000000000003
probably fake why did you bring it up

2333.44 --> 2337.28
now you made me explore the entire

2335.599 --> 2340.6400000000003
concept

2337.28 --> 2344.0
when you already think it's faked that's

2340.64 --> 2344.0
kind of a dick move dude

2345.839 --> 2349.7599999999998
oh because you did actually experience

2348.0 --> 2352.76
something like that okay

2349.76 --> 2352.76
fine

2376.0 --> 2380.0
okay

2377.4 --> 2383.64
jbdl that's

2380.0 --> 2383.64
yeah that's what happens

2393.76 --> 2397.32
behind the tree

2455.81 --> 2459.0099999999998
[Music]

2464.0 --> 2468.48
it shared the screen yeah i know

2471.28 --> 2479.0
but if you're already dismissing it

2474.88 --> 2479.0
then why did you bring it up

2480.319 --> 2483.04
like

2481.359 --> 2485.04
never mind

2483.04 --> 2485.839
it's just weird to bring that up like

2485.04 --> 2488.079
why

2485.839 --> 2488.0789999999997
like

2492.88 --> 2497.2000000000003
like i don't even see what the hell that

2494.96 --> 2499.359
has anything to do with like

2497.2 --> 2502.56
what we're talking about

2499.359 --> 2505.119
the holographic celestials

2502.56 --> 2507.2
i mean it's obviously not holographic

2505.119 --> 2511.599
because we're talking about

2507.2 --> 2513.7599999999998
living animals in euclidean space

2511.599 --> 2516.76
so

2513.76 --> 2516.76
uh

2523.68 --> 2527.5989999999997
damn it my cameras are freaking

2529.92 --> 2534.04
just stick to that side

2545.68 --> 2549.839
okay so this one was good okay well you

2547.839 --> 2552.88
better damn well find that video and

2549.839 --> 2552.88
post it here now

2554.0 --> 2560.4
and then i'm gonna watch it

2556.24 --> 2560.3999999999996
and get back at you because this is just

2562.96 --> 2565.839
kind of pointless now

2592.079 --> 2595.079
huh

2609.2 --> 2613.839
right so in the meantime i'll try to

2611.76 --> 2617.1600000000003
just get back on track what i was

2613.839 --> 2617.16
talking about

2632.319 --> 2635.319
huh

2646.56 --> 2652.0
maybe they could do it in vr right back

2649.119 --> 2655.599
yeah yeah it's very easy actually in a

2652.0 --> 2658.56
virtual world even in 3d

2655.599 --> 2660.079
like a 3d environment to have the

2658.56 --> 2660.7999999999997
backdrop

2660.079 --> 2662.4
be

2660.8 --> 2664.8
celestial

2662.4 --> 2667.359
like that's actually really easy it's

2664.8 --> 2671.28
surpri you like you know how they do it

2667.359 --> 2676.0
they literally take another dimension

2671.28 --> 2678.8
which is the background the background

2676.0 --> 2680.24
which is always there wherever you point

2678.8 --> 2681.599
the camera at

2680.24 --> 2685.52
and it might have

2681.599 --> 2687.599
might be inside of a sphere effectively

2685.52 --> 2690.88
right the background

2687.599 --> 2692.319
while inside of that all is usually the

2690.88 --> 2693.44
box

2692.319 --> 2694.48
filled

2693.44 --> 2698.0
with the

2694.48 --> 2700.48
alleged yeah with the 3d

2698.0 --> 2704.64
objects mountains environment everything

2700.48 --> 2708.2400000000002
right it's inside of a background in the

2704.64 --> 2710.319
background they can literally insert a

2708.24 --> 2712.7999999999997
celestial system in there that it

2710.319 --> 2715.04
operates exactly

2712.8 --> 2717.76
like it does in the real world

2715.04 --> 2719.7599999999998
and it will always be at an apparent

2717.76 --> 2722.2400000000002
distance you can never reach it it's

2719.76 --> 2723.8390000000004
literally the background

2722.24 --> 2726.0
you see

2723.839 --> 2729.68
it's so easy to do it

2726.0 --> 2729.68
in video games in 3d

2731.119 --> 2735.92
right but that's no that's just going to

2733.119 --> 2738.079
show you how it's just the simulation it

2735.92 --> 2740.48
doesn't actually reveal like how that

2738.079 --> 2741.3590000000004
can mechanically work in the physical

2740.48 --> 2744.56
world

2741.359 --> 2748.72
right it's much easier to just emulate

2744.56 --> 2753.04
how it works than it is to actually

2748.72 --> 2753.04
try to emulate it physically

2753.359 --> 2758.72
to simulate it to literally make

2756.319 --> 2762.24
something physical happen just like the

2758.72 --> 2764.48
celestials now there's a challenge

2762.24 --> 2766.72
and you start that challenge with like a

2764.48 --> 2769.119
sort of a mirror room as i described

2766.72 --> 2769.1189999999997
earlier

2769.92 --> 2776.88
just in time of the end of the show no

2771.68 --> 2776.8799999999997
price of adam no this is weekend

2778.319 --> 2782.359
six more hours proof

2823.68 --> 2826.68
uh

2838.24 --> 2841.24
hmm

2870.0 --> 2873.68
what

2871.44 --> 2875.52
doctor dissolution he goes through a lot

2873.68 --> 2878.3999999999996
of those videos what you mean those

2875.52 --> 2880.64
disappearing cow videos are you for real

2878.4 --> 2883.64
at least gee

2880.64 --> 2883.64
what

2905.16 --> 2908.35
[Music]

2923.44 --> 2929.68
okay lg can you summarize it

2926.8 --> 2932.6400000000003
if you've seen him those videos what is

2929.68 --> 2932.64
this conclusion

2935.76 --> 2941.2400000000002
i'm not gonna watch those videos if you

2938.0 --> 2941.24
don't mind

2948.4 --> 2952.8
videos where people think something

2949.92 --> 2952.8
weird is going on

2953.44 --> 2957.16
and what is this conclusion

3002.88 --> 3007.28
first thing to consider is whether the

3004.4 --> 3010.48
videos are genuine of course

3007.28 --> 3013.28
i mean if you're going to seriously

3010.48 --> 3015.599
consider that it might be real

3013.28 --> 3018.559
a real event that is caught on camera

3015.599 --> 3018.559
then you have to

3018.88 --> 3021.76
be an expert

3022.72 --> 3025.68
in

3023.52 --> 3025.68
like

3026.24 --> 3030.64
digital analysis like you have to

3028.16 --> 3034.0
actually take the video

3030.64 --> 3036.72
and then figure out how it was even made

3034.0 --> 3038.079
like has there been photoshop

3036.72 --> 3039.1189999999997
involved

3038.079 --> 3041.3590000000004
like

3039.119 --> 3043.6800000000003
was it originally two videos spliced

3041.359 --> 3046.16
into one you have to just figure out

3043.68 --> 3048.8799999999997
like on a digital level what actually

3046.16 --> 3048.8799999999997
happened with it

3052.559 --> 3059.8390000000004
right because when you work on pieces of

3056.16 --> 3062.96
data including pictures or videos

3059.839 --> 3066.88
like how it changed is recorded

3062.96 --> 3070.559
like there is like metadata in a single

3066.88 --> 3073.839
file right like even if like i go on my

3070.559 --> 3076.1600000000003
pc i take some photograph

3073.839 --> 3078.16
i can literally like click on properties

3076.16 --> 3079.359
and then see

3078.16 --> 3081.68
when

3079.359 --> 3085.68
it was first made

3081.68 --> 3088.319
and when it was even edited or moved

3085.68 --> 3090.24
right it just has a registry of that and

3088.319 --> 3093.2
that's just one file like

3090.24 --> 3095.52
metadata it's right there

3093.2 --> 3097.52
it's always there right that's standard

3095.52 --> 3100.72
that's standardized now all you need to

3097.52 --> 3102.48
know is figure out

3100.72 --> 3104.7999999999997
how to

3102.48 --> 3106.2400000000002
get into the details and see what

3104.8 --> 3108.559
happened here right that's what the

3106.24 --> 3111.2799999999997
people that do all the nasa stuff

3108.559 --> 3112.96
analysis that's what they do too

3111.28 --> 3115.76
right that's how we get all these oh

3112.96 --> 3118.0
look they obviously photoshopped this

3115.76 --> 3120.2400000000002
picture of earth

3118.0 --> 3121.28
in there at the supposed moon landing

3120.24 --> 3122.7999999999997
right

3121.28 --> 3127.3590000000004
that that's

3122.8 --> 3130.2400000000002
and for yeah photo forensic analysis

3127.359 --> 3131.359
it's not that hard to do really to get a

3130.24 --> 3133.7599999999998
basic

3131.359 --> 3135.92
picture right to get to the full details

3133.76 --> 3139.8390000000004
you have to really

3135.92 --> 3139.839
yeah be one of those guys

3140.88 --> 3143.44
that's just good at it

3142.48 --> 3145.76
but

3143.44 --> 3150.04
all files have

3145.76 --> 3150.0400000000004
like data metadata

3155.28 --> 3159.119
yeah james webb brought to you by adobe

3157.119 --> 3160.96
photoshop indeed

3159.119 --> 3163.119
it's right there

3160.96 --> 3166.28
like in the very files that they share

3163.119 --> 3166.28
with you

3187.69 --> 3190.92
[Music]

3197.52 --> 3199.839
the

3206.839 --> 3213.68
block okay that's a weird

3210.88 --> 3213.6800000000003
disillusion

3218.88 --> 3222.4
i don't know if i'm gonna sub to that

3220.64 --> 3224.4
but i guess i will like

3222.4 --> 3228.28
take a look at some of those videos at

3224.4 --> 3228.28
least they're sure

3238.8 --> 3243.0
wow that guy's a big channel

3247.37 --> 3250.63

okay

3274.91 --> 3277.969
[Music]

3326.48 --> 3331.96

3328.64 --> 3331.96
by the way

3333.02 --> 3336.2599999999998
[Music]

3343.76 --> 3348.92
okay

3344.72 --> 3348.9199999999996
fine i'll take a look at it

3389.52 --> 3397.079
holy [ __ ]

3391.839 --> 3397.0789999999997
this guy's been added for 14 years

3407.52 --> 3410.52
ah

3427.359 --> 3431.5989999999997
gotta have a good gimmick to stand out

3429.359 --> 3432.5589999999997
these days

3431.599 --> 3434.319
or

3432.559 --> 3437.88
you're just

3434.319 --> 3437.88
ahead of everybody

3451.839 --> 3457.4
a bit of a gimmick is is handy you're

3454.4 --> 3457.4
right

3462.64 --> 3468.48
vfx studio i wanted

3466.319 --> 3470.799
all right so he is like a

3468.48 --> 3472.2400000000002
a video effects guy

3470.799 --> 3474.88
professionally

3472.24 --> 3476.72
all right that's interesting

3474.88 --> 3479.28
that that could be very interesting if

3476.72 --> 3482.64
he is like one of those guys

3479.28 --> 3486.92
yeah i will check out his channel

3482.64 --> 3486.92
even subscribe to him

3494.05 --> 3497.2290000000003
[Music]

3498.16 --> 3501.16
um

3527.599 --> 3533.119
right guys still got like at least

3530.079 --> 3533.119
another hour to go

3537.92 --> 3545.2400000000002
so is there anything else you guys would

3540.16 --> 3545.24
like me to bring up talk about reference

3547.04 --> 3549.599
questions

3551.2 --> 3554.64
right because if it's just going to end

3552.88 --> 3556.1600000000003
up with another guy's channel that i

3554.64 --> 3560.24
don't know about then there's nothing i

3556.16 --> 3562.64
can say about that then just drop it off

3560.24 --> 3564.9599999999996
and then stop talking

3562.64 --> 3567.92
that that like really

3564.96 --> 3567.92
halts my show

3568.24 --> 3573.839
because i'm not gonna watch it while i'm

3570.24 --> 3573.839
doing my show obviously

3605.599 --> 3609.44
hmm

3607.52 --> 3613.599
okay by the way rig back you say that

3609.44 --> 3615.44
you did i don't understand your sentence

3613.599 --> 3619.2000000000003
kick yourself for

3615.44 --> 3621.44
not seeing it all through the hubble era

3619.2 --> 3623.68
what does that mean

3621.44 --> 3624.48
you mean that you didn't see it through

3623.68 --> 3629.0789999999997
it

3624.48 --> 3629.079
in the hubble era with those photos

3633.839 --> 3640.16
i kind of did but then again i

3637.28 --> 3643.44
got the idea very early that it was all

3640.16 --> 3646.319
just computer generated

3643.44 --> 3648.559
like how i laid it down on my show like

3646.319 --> 3650.48
they yeah they might see like a couple

3648.559 --> 3653.2000000000003
of pixels of this and that and then they

3650.48 --> 3654.4
have the artist team

3653.2 --> 3657.359
just

3654.4 --> 3660.4
creating it like how does this actually

3657.359 --> 3664.0789999999997
look how are you going to make it look

3660.4 --> 3664.079
how's that supposed to look now

3665.839 --> 3670.72
oh and james webb photos look the same

3668.24 --> 3674.0
yeah in many ways because it's kind of

3670.72 --> 3677.3999999999996
the same type of team

3674.0 --> 3677.4
that do it

3690.4 --> 3694.88
what what are you talking about

3691.76 --> 3698.599
fluttersh feet your mind no

3694.88 --> 3698.599
when did you do that

3725.76 --> 3731.079
okay there's three youtube channels like

3728.079 --> 3731.079
that

3767.039 --> 3771.599
i must have not

3769.119 --> 3776.52
picked up on that letter sage i don't

3771.599 --> 3776.52
remember you mentioning that before

3782.48 --> 3786.48
i'm looking at the channel it seems all

3785.119 --> 3789.52
very

3786.48 --> 3789.52
general stuff

3793.92 --> 3798.559
though he is a flat earther

3796.72 --> 3800.8799999999997
apparently

3798.559 --> 3804.039
since there's like a video of rob skiba

3800.88 --> 3804.039
in there

3811.92 --> 3817.2400000000002
seems very biblical oriented in ways

3830.96 --> 3833.96
right

3847.52 --> 3850.52
hmm

3863.359 --> 3866.359
hmm

3897.92 --> 3900.799
you need dominoid

3900.99 --> 3905.359
[Music]

3903.039 --> 3909.8390000000004
right yeah tear it i don't know

3905.359 --> 3909.839
third grade oh worried then

3911.359 --> 3916.0
but yeah i would believe it too even if

3913.76 --> 3917.76
people would tell me that's just cgi i

3916.0 --> 3920.24
would still believe it i would still

3917.76 --> 3923.2400000000002
believe that that was out there

3920.24 --> 3923.24
right

3924.48 --> 3928.48
or i didn't even know if i really

3926.24 --> 3929.359
believed i just liked

3928.48 --> 3930.4
it

3929.359 --> 3932.4
as

3930.4 --> 3935.44
like it's beautiful i just thought like

3932.4 --> 3937.44
that that yeah these pictures make space

3935.44 --> 3939.359
look beautiful then

3937.44 --> 3942.839
i don't have a problem with that even

3939.359 --> 3942.839
though it's fake

3942.93 --> 3946.1099999999997
[Music]

3957.68 --> 3962.64
seven right

3959.599 --> 3965.039
yes a little kid then yeah

3962.64 --> 3967.52
no i love that too

3965.039 --> 3967.5200000000004
definitely

3969.839 --> 3973.64
this is feed your mind

4005.839 --> 4007.92
you

4033.2 --> 4039.52
look how unrealistically old space

4035.839 --> 4039.52
shuttle footage looks yeah yeah

4041.52 --> 4046.48
if it was real it would look

4044.16 --> 4046.48
real

4075.68 --> 4078.68
um

4090.72 --> 4094.9599999999996
okay tara 306 that's unheard of

4097.6 --> 4103.1990000000005
you mean that's never happened before

4099.359 --> 4103.1990000000005
that's a new thing that they did that

4103.839 --> 4107.199
like

4104.719 --> 4110.4800000000005
if that's new then what did the parents

4107.199 --> 4110.48
and all that even think of it

4110.799 --> 4114.239
i mean there should be like religious

4112.88 --> 4116.719
objections

4114.239 --> 4116.718999999999
to that

4116.799 --> 4119.839
from some at least

4126.22 --> 4129.379
[Music]

4139.679 --> 4142.679
yes

4144.38 --> 4151.759
[Music]

4175.29 --> 4178.51
[Music]

4224.64 --> 4228.719
the more i study the less it makes sense

4226.88 --> 4230.64
yeah

4228.719 --> 4233.44
that's interesting isn't it when you

4230.64 --> 4233.4400000000005
figure that out

4237.04 --> 4241.44
yeah i figured that out very early on

4241.6 --> 4245.1990000000005
because

4242.8 --> 4246.64
i would just always end up having

4245.199 --> 4248.719
questions and then

4246.64 --> 4251.679
bothering either the teacher or my

4248.719 --> 4251.679
parents about it

4252.159 --> 4257.4
to test their limits of their knowledge

4266.15 --> 4269.339999999999
[Music]

4269.44 --> 4274.48
but in a way i always felt like this

4272.159 --> 4279.36
freaking astronomy and all that that it

4274.48 --> 4282.159
was just a waste of time

4279.36 --> 4285.199
and like it even as it was very young it

4282.159 --> 4287.599999999999
just seems embarrassing

4285.199 --> 4290.719
like

4287.6 --> 4293.92
like i could feel like oh so you're like

4290.719 --> 4297.04
oh you're like an astronomer

4293.92 --> 4298.08
well that means you're [ __ ]

4297.04 --> 4302.239
because

4298.08 --> 4304.96
it's a waste of time it's all a complete

4302.239 --> 4307.12
waste of time it's literally just spend

4304.96 --> 4309.44
your time on nonsense

4307.12 --> 4311.92
that's even kind of boring

4309.44 --> 4314.96
it's only if you all believe the dream

4311.92 --> 4318.8
then it might be sort of exciting but

4314.96 --> 4318.8
it's such a waste of time it's like

4319.04 --> 4322.4
the dumb type of nerds

4321.44 --> 4324.799999999999
right

4322.4 --> 4327.5199999999995
i mean there's smart nerds

4324.8 --> 4329.4400000000005
and those were often like

4327.52 --> 4331.280000000001
gamer types

4329.44 --> 4334.4
they were smart

4331.28 --> 4336.4
then you had the dumb nerds

4334.4 --> 4338.719
people that were like oh they are kind

4336.4 --> 4341.44
of high intelligence and they do figure

4338.719 --> 4343.6
out math and all that very easily

4341.44 --> 4345.44
but they just don't understand when

4343.6 --> 4348.0
something is not real

4345.44 --> 4349.44
they just don't get it they're dim

4348.0 --> 4351.6
in a way they've

4349.44 --> 4352.639999999999
they're quick but they're dim

4351.6 --> 4355.120000000001
and

4352.64 --> 4358.8
[ __ ] nerds and that's how i always

4355.12 --> 4360.64
saw like astronomer people that are like

4358.8 --> 4362.96
into debt and they were always like had

4360.64 --> 4364.2390000000005
just this weakness the spirit of

4362.96 --> 4365.04
weakness and

4364.239 --> 4367.199
like

4365.04 --> 4368.96
being a dumbass over themselves oh

4367.199 --> 4371.44
you're so good with math but you're

4368.96 --> 4374.0
actually a dumbass

4371.44 --> 4376.799999999999
the dumb nerds

4374.0 --> 4379.04
so i never i never liked it

4376.8 --> 4381.679
i never had respect for that

4379.04 --> 4383.5199999999995
it all it was always a waste of time

4381.679 --> 4385.52
even as i still

4383.52 --> 4388.56
that space and all that was real

4385.52 --> 4390.88
astronomy was always just a waste of

4388.56 --> 4390.88
time

4390.96 --> 4395.8
to me

4391.92 --> 4395.8
even as a little kid

4409.52 --> 4416.2390000000005
you did like astronomy well i i did not

4413.76 --> 4419.360000000001
i mean i liked

4416.239 --> 4421.44
videos like on television about

4419.36 --> 4423.28
astronomy and then talking about it and

4421.44 --> 4426.879999999999
then making up their [ __ ] stories

4423.28 --> 4429.44
and some cgi i loved i loved space

4426.88 --> 4432.719
story's telling right

4429.44 --> 4435.839999999999
but like actually doing astronomy on

4432.719 --> 4438.159
your own is [ __ ] boring man and a

4435.84 --> 4440.88
waste of time

4438.159 --> 4443.12
what a waste of time all of that right

4440.88 --> 4444.8
it was the space storytelling [ __ ] that

4443.12 --> 4447.04
i liked that's it

4444.8 --> 4448.400000000001
not gonna waste my time on freaking

4447.04 --> 4452.44
astronomy

4448.4 --> 4452.44
god it's so dumb

4466.48 --> 4469.36
hey tony wickham

4480.48 --> 4484.159
studying gravity really

4486.96 --> 4490.8
pointless so you became a carpenter yeah

4488.8 --> 4492.2390000000005
well that's

4490.8 --> 4495.2390000000005
well that's actually a valuable

4492.239 --> 4495.239
profession

4496.64 --> 4500.96
good on you

4498.08 --> 4500.96
by the way for that

4504.32 --> 4508.84
i have a nephew that's also a carpenter

4513.6 --> 4520.52
or at least i think he is

4515.44 --> 4520.5199999999995
it was the last time that i saw him

4537.6 --> 4541.4400000000005
star trek the next generation broke your

4540.0 --> 4545.12
heart

4541.44 --> 4545.12
when you found out why

4548.56 --> 4552.64
it's that

4549.76 --> 4555.52
what got me into astronomy well it

4552.64 --> 4557.1990000000005
shouldn't because it makes absolutely no

4555.52 --> 4558.719
sense

4557.199 --> 4562.879999999999
right like

4558.719 --> 4567.92
the next generation did not address

4562.88 --> 4571.04
stellar astronomy or anything at all

4567.92 --> 4573.6
just no just was not addressed at all it

4571.04 --> 4577.12
wasn't even a thing it was only

4573.6 --> 4577.120000000001
in the follow-up series

4578.84 --> 4584.88
uh not deep space nine but voyager

4585.12 --> 4591.92
in the late 90s great i love that show i

4588.0 --> 4593.679
have it on dvd i love that show still do

4591.92 --> 4596.0
they actually

4593.679 --> 4598.0
invoked

4596.0 --> 4602.159
like stellar astronomy they even had

4598.0 --> 4602.159
like a special room for it

4603.12 --> 4607.44
right where they would like coordinate

4606.0 --> 4610.0
where they are because they were

4607.44 --> 4613.36
practically exploring unexplored space

4610.0 --> 4614.8
so they just made that room

4613.36 --> 4617.28
for it right

4614.8 --> 4619.04
in next generation it didn't exist it

4617.28 --> 4620.639999999999
wasn't even addressed

4619.04 --> 4622.88
it was just all

4620.64 --> 4626.159000000001
which much more like historical

4622.88 --> 4628.96
references to actual exploration and all

4626.159 --> 4628.96
that right

4629.12 --> 4632.719
it was all star trek next generation was

4631.12 --> 4634.96
all about that

4632.719 --> 4637.6
about getting historical and references

4634.96 --> 4640.0
it like how it went in the past

4637.6 --> 4641.120000000001
and then kind of projecting that

4640.0 --> 4644.8
dream

4641.12 --> 4647.44
onto the star trek reality right to pull

4644.8 --> 4648.96
the old with us into the future

4647.44 --> 4651.04
that was the star trek the next

4648.96 --> 4653.4
generation but they didn't address

4651.04 --> 4656.56
anything mechanical they were like

4653.4 --> 4658.239
non-technical in most ways the only real

4656.56 --> 4661.1990000000005
technical things that they tried to

4658.239 --> 4663.36
address a little was through data about

4661.199 --> 4664.719
robotics and artificial intelligence and

4663.36 --> 4666.0
such things

4664.719 --> 4667.92
right

4666.0 --> 4670.239
that's pretty much it it was not that

4667.92 --> 4672.64
technical

4670.239 --> 4675.199
now in voyager it became a lot more

4672.64 --> 4675.1990000000005
technical

4676.88 --> 4679.84
the next generation is the best star

4678.719 --> 4681.36
trek

4679.84 --> 4683.92
yeah

4681.36 --> 4686.48
it was pretty cool

4683.92 --> 4686.4800000000005
a lot of it

4686.8 --> 4690.96
but it was also kind of goofy

4690.159 --> 4693.599999999999
right

4690.96 --> 4696.08
as you look at star trek voyager star

4693.6 --> 4700.320000000001
trek voyager is not goofy

4696.08 --> 4703.04
it has like social comedy

4700.32 --> 4707.44
but it's not goofy

4703.04 --> 4709.36
right where it's like actually goofy

4707.44 --> 4711.44
star trek next generation has like

4709.36 --> 4713.44
really goofy moments that are just kind

4711.44 --> 4716.32
of like come on guys

4713.44 --> 4717.12
you have to do this really

4716.32 --> 4719.5199999999995
like

4717.12 --> 4722.5599999999995
as a tribute to the star trek original

4719.52 --> 4726.080000000001
series which was like unbelievably goofy

4722.56 --> 4726.080000000001
at times but yeah it's

4726.719 --> 4732.96
the early sci-fi era you know

4731.04 --> 4735.12
but i thought that voyager was just much

4732.96 --> 4737.36
more serious in nature the entire series

4735.12 --> 4739.44
was much more serious much more

4737.36 --> 4742.719
technical much more

4739.44 --> 4742.719
socially studied

4744.159 --> 4747.759999999999
so i think that in all the star trek

4745.92 --> 4749.92
series i think that that one really was

4747.76 --> 4752.8
the best overall

4749.92 --> 4754.56
because it has the most cohesive story

4752.8 --> 4756.96
development

4754.56 --> 4759.4400000000005
and character development

4756.96 --> 4759.44
and like

4760.159 --> 4764.48
it's dealing with real social problems

4762.4 --> 4765.679
and character problems it's interesting

4764.48 --> 4768.4
i liked

4765.679 --> 4771.36
i liked voyager a lot

4768.4 --> 4774.96
but i do also like the next generation a

4771.36 --> 4774.96
lot of it was interesting

4775.199 --> 4780.239
right they introduced the borg and the

4777.92 --> 4780.2390000000005
queue

4780.56 --> 4786.64
but yeah the voyageur like really

4783.84 --> 4788.719
expanded upon

4786.64 --> 4791.12
the uh the borg

4788.719 --> 4793.12
like a lot

4791.12 --> 4794.96
they really integrated it into the

4793.12 --> 4796.08
universe

4794.96 --> 4797.84
and

4796.08 --> 4801.5199999999995
that was amazing

4797.84 --> 4805.04
it was really well developed

4801.52 --> 4807.92
great long-term story writing team great

4805.04 --> 4811.04
fantastic no more like it was actually a

4807.92 --> 4812.8
series now with a timeline

4811.04 --> 4816.239
instead of just like a bunch of

4812.8 --> 4819.679
separated sci-fi little mini stories all

4816.239 --> 4821.12
just shoved into a giant pack of fries

4819.679 --> 4824.12
right

4821.12 --> 4824.12
anyway

4833.679 --> 4840.92
is the bigger bullshitter or whatever

4836.239 --> 4840.919999999999
what the hell are you talking about

4865.36 --> 4873.96
what are you talking about rick back

4869.679 --> 4873.96
so incredibly random

4887.44 --> 4891.919999999999
star trek yeah it was futurists

4892.56 --> 4896.080000000001
and they were you the original series

4894.88 --> 4898.4800000000005
was very

4896.08 --> 4902.08
blatantly like

4898.48 --> 4904.718999999999
industrial advertisement it was like the

4902.08 --> 4906.96
main rollout point for eugenics pretty

4904.719 --> 4906.96
much

4907.84 --> 4910.56
viruses

4910.8 --> 4913.400000000001
and just

4912.56 --> 4916.8
even

4913.4 --> 4920.4
luciferianism in a way like man is god

4916.8 --> 4922.08
is going to rise to the throne

4920.4 --> 4924.5199999999995
right

4922.08 --> 4926.239
atheism

4924.52 --> 4930.4800000000005
luciferianism

4926.239 --> 4933.919999999999
mindset well that was there in star trek

4930.48 --> 4933.919999999999
and viruses

4936.639 --> 4940.32
right

4937.6 --> 4942.719
so they were like

4940.32 --> 4945.04
one of the main drivers and it was

4942.719 --> 4946.639
heavily invested in probably because of

4945.04 --> 4950.0
that

4946.639 --> 4953.6
it was social engineering placement

4950.0 --> 4956.4
which is by the way what science fiction

4953.6 --> 4959.04
was really original for

4956.4 --> 4961.599999999999
science fiction was always

4959.04 --> 4963.199
propaganda

4961.6 --> 4965.4400000000005
right

4963.199 --> 4966.799999999999
i mean yeah for the individual you can

4965.44 --> 4968.879999999999
have your own science fiction you have

4966.8 --> 4970.320000000001
cool ideas nothing's going to happen you

4968.88 --> 4973.04
there's like a book and maybe a little

4970.32 --> 4974.08
bit popular or whatever right

4973.04 --> 4974.8
but like

4974.08 --> 4978.159
when

4974.8 --> 4980.8
big money is thrown at it that's because

4978.159 --> 4984.0
it has propaganda

4980.8 --> 4987.76
it has social engineering

4984.0 --> 4990.4
that is worth the investment

4987.76 --> 4992.400000000001
for the ones that are always the drivers

4990.4 --> 4994.0
to like

4992.4 --> 4997.5199999999995
eugenics and

4994.0 --> 4997.52
social engineering and all that

4997.84 --> 5002.08
right and those are the the big movies

5000.96 --> 5004.4800000000005
and

5002.08 --> 5007.84
products that are like advertised

5004.48 --> 5010.159
everywhere those are the the

5007.84 --> 5013.52
the science fiction

5010.159 --> 5013.5199999999995
things that contain

5013.76 --> 5019.76
be invested in propaganda

5016.96 --> 5021.199
to hand out ideas about what the future

5019.76 --> 5023.52
is

5021.199 --> 5025.919999999999
to people right

5023.52 --> 5027.1990000000005
so that when they consider the future

5025.92 --> 5031.1990000000005
they will

5027.199 --> 5033.678999999999
think they will stay relevant by echoing

5031.199 --> 5036.799999999999
those things

5033.679 --> 5039.36
that they pick up on

5036.8 --> 5042.4400000000005
in the science fiction like eugenics

5039.36 --> 5045.44
like oh we have to call the herd or

5042.44 --> 5046.239
overpopulation or all viruses

5045.44 --> 5049.04
right

5046.239 --> 5052.08
it's all information placement it's all

5049.04 --> 5052.08
social engineering

5054.32 --> 5058.159
oh see you later iron 26

5058.239 --> 5062.04
thanks for popping bye

5075.199 --> 5079.12
i still don't know who this kip thorny

5077.36 --> 5082.4
is

5079.12 --> 5085.84
there were 306 i mean carl sagan i know

5082.4 --> 5085.839999999999
yeah for sure

5127.04 --> 5133.6
the guy who worked

5129.52 --> 5133.6
in making interstellar

5136.32 --> 5138.159
worked

5137.44 --> 5139.199
in

5138.159 --> 5142.239
you mean

5139.199 --> 5144.96
they consulted him

5142.239 --> 5147.12
about it so he's just a

5144.96 --> 5149.679
science fiction thinker and like oh how

5147.12 --> 5149.679
would it be

5150.88 --> 5155.159000000001
oh god i'll look him up

5164.4 --> 5166.638999999999
oh

5167.12 --> 5171.199
i think i yeah i recognize that guy

5172.08 --> 5174.719
he's old

5177.6 --> 5182.679
man he's like 80

5179.679 --> 5182.679
82.

5183.84 --> 5187.12
yeah but i recognize him

5195.12 --> 5201.28
theoretical physicist

5198.28 --> 5203.36
gravitational physics and astrophysics

5201.28 --> 5206.0
yeah

5203.36 --> 5208.88
oh thank you for your contribution

5206.0 --> 5208.88
of the fictional

5209.6 --> 5212.2390000000005
tipthorne

5215.92 --> 5220.639
the basics of the black hole red right

5218.239 --> 5223.28
okay rick back yeah well they did a good

5220.639 --> 5224.96
job i thought it was amazing

5223.28 --> 5227.5199999999995
i mean yeah

5224.96 --> 5229.04
i think i could potentially contribute

5227.52 --> 5232.080000000001
to something like that too right it's

5229.04 --> 5234.159
like oh how would it be if it were real

5232.08 --> 5235.76
well i thought they did a really well

5234.159 --> 5237.839999999999
worked out job

5235.76 --> 5241.4400000000005
on the whole wormhole thing it was

5237.84 --> 5243.52
amazing i liked interstellar it was

5241.44 --> 5245.12
really interesting

5243.52 --> 5246.88
fascinating

5245.12 --> 5249.12
movie very

5246.88 --> 5250.96
inspiring

5249.12 --> 5254.32
in ways and also

5250.96 --> 5254.32
ridiculously dark

5255.28 --> 5260.08
in other ways

5258.08 --> 5261.84
it's just like it's a it was a great

5260.08 --> 5264.08
space drama

5261.84 --> 5265.92
and i really appreciated the movie so

5264.08 --> 5267.199
yeah if he's the one that helped them

5265.92 --> 5269.36
with like the

5267.199 --> 5271.839999999999
what would it be like

5269.36 --> 5273.679
well that was a good move because i was

5271.84 --> 5276.08
extremely impressed by the whole

5273.679 --> 5278.4800000000005
wormhole physics scene so

5276.08 --> 5280.4
extremely impressed

5278.48 --> 5281.919999999999
just like how they made it look and

5280.4 --> 5284.0
because that is like yeah that makes

5281.92 --> 5286.8
perfect sense to me that is what it

5284.0 --> 5286.8
would be like

5288.639 --> 5293.2390000000005
if it were real which it isn't

5296.88 --> 5303.04
he's messed up their brain so much why

5300.239 --> 5305.839999999999
he's just been extremely detailed about

5303.04 --> 5306.96
the presuppositional system

5305.84 --> 5309.76
i guess

5306.96 --> 5311.6
right he is the one that's writing the

5309.76 --> 5313.6
mechanics part

5311.6 --> 5316.719
of this fictional story that all the

5313.6 --> 5316.719
people want to believe in

5318.08 --> 5323.12
he can't mess up your brain he can only

5320.4 --> 5326.159
mess up your brain if you

5323.12 --> 5329.12
allow him to because you want to know

5326.159 --> 5331.679
the details of the dream that you think

5329.12 --> 5331.679
is real

5333.76 --> 5337.12
right

5334.96 --> 5339.679
nobody's forcing you to do that you want

5337.12 --> 5341.5199999999995
to know it you want to hold on to the

5339.679 --> 5343.36
belief that it's real

5341.52 --> 5347.080000000001
that's the only way you can mess up your

5343.36 --> 5347.08
own mind right

5355.36 --> 5359.839999999999
not quite the same

5357.28 --> 5362.08
well not look

5359.84 --> 5364.159000000001
if you mean that if i watch interstellar

5362.08 --> 5365.28
now i'm not going to get like the rush

5364.159 --> 5368.0
from it like

5365.28 --> 5370.4
wow what would it be like once we could

5368.0 --> 5373.04
actually go into a black hole like that

5370.4 --> 5375.44
like yeah i'm not gonna get like a

5373.04 --> 5378.159
like a giant kick from it again right

5375.44 --> 5381.5199999999995
because i just know it's pure conception

5378.159 --> 5381.5199999999995
like that can never happen

5382.0 --> 5387.679
so i'll not get that level of kick out

5384.159 --> 5390.4
of it except the music and the music and

5387.679 --> 5393.04
interstellar is very detailed very

5390.4 --> 5395.36
careful how they placed it and the music

5393.04 --> 5397.5199999999995
will still kind of pull you in like that

5395.36 --> 5400.719
right the music kind of tells you when

5397.52 --> 5400.719
it's really dramatic

5401.36 --> 5407.839999999999
for if you're kind of numb down

5404.96 --> 5407.84
so

5414.32 --> 5419.5199999999995
yeah i know right back yeah that part

5416.48 --> 5421.839999999999
that really got to be as well so

5419.52 --> 5423.76
i always have that [ __ ]

5421.84 --> 5425.84
it's like at the edge of darkness too

5423.76 --> 5428.320000000001
it's all about yeah your daughter and

5425.84 --> 5430.0
then she dies or something and then the

5428.32 --> 5433.04
rest of the movie you're completely

5430.0 --> 5435.28
[ __ ] up over it like i i sympathize

5433.04 --> 5437.92
way too much with that

5435.28 --> 5439.84
in a way i hate it

5437.92 --> 5441.92
i hope never something like that will

5439.84 --> 5444.32
never happen to me

5441.92 --> 5444.32
ever

5446.48 --> 5453.5199999999995
but uh yeah

5450.239 --> 5457.08
the man and his daughter is always

5453.52 --> 5457.080000000001
those are the movies

5458.28 --> 5461.438999999999
[Music]

5463.84 --> 5467.360000000001
but yeah

5465.52 --> 5468.8
i still get a kick out of watching a

5467.36 --> 5471.12
movie like that

5468.8 --> 5473.360000000001
but the one thing that really does stand

5471.12 --> 5476.48
out to me is that i feel more like i'm

5473.36 --> 5478.799999999999
being manipulated

5476.48 --> 5482.718999999999
it feels more like a carnivore right now

5478.8 --> 5485.360000000001
and that part i do kind of like miss

5482.719 --> 5487.6
the actually believing it was real and

5485.36 --> 5489.599999999999
like getting a real kick out of it yeah

5487.6 --> 5491.84
i missed that

5489.6 --> 5491.84
but

5492.639 --> 5497.1990000000005
i still like i can still just enjoy the

5495.679 --> 5499.84
fantasy of it i

5497.199 --> 5502.32
like look when you watch like lord of

5499.84 --> 5506.4800000000005
the rings the movie right some epic [ __ ]

5502.32 --> 5509.04
in there you don't like get shocked to

5506.48 --> 5510.159
realize oh wait that's not real

5509.04 --> 5511.5199999999995
right

5510.159 --> 5513.759999999999
no

5511.52 --> 5515.120000000001
no you won't

5513.76 --> 5517.92
so

5515.12 --> 5520.32
why wouldn't you treat science fiction

5517.92 --> 5523.28
exactly the same

5520.32 --> 5526.5599999999995
exactly the same it's another

5523.28 --> 5526.5599999999995
fantasy world

5527.04 --> 5532.4
can't you enjoy fantasy

5529.76 --> 5534.639
why couldn't you enjoy space fantasy the

5532.4 --> 5536.799999999999
exact same way

5534.639 --> 5538.88
with exception that a lot of people tend

5536.8 --> 5543.08
to actually believe that nonsense could

5538.88 --> 5543.08
be real that's the difference

5548.8 --> 5553.92
yeah terry i agree tara 306 yeah just

5551.84 --> 5555.6
interstellar was like on the edge

5553.92 --> 5558.4
science fiction where they wanted to

5555.6 --> 5561.76
treat every fantastical concept and they

5558.4 --> 5565.199
did and i loved it it's amazing but the

5561.76 --> 5565.1990000000005
martian was much more

5565.28 --> 5570.96
pun intended down to earth it watched

5567.36 --> 5570.96
much more about just like

5571.28 --> 5574.4
like oh what if it's real and then what

5573.12 --> 5576.0
could happen and

5574.4 --> 5578.799999999999
but i like the martian i thought it was

5576.0 --> 5580.56
an awesome interesting it was a

5578.8 --> 5581.84
a movie that was like

5580.56 --> 5584.400000000001
i liked it

5581.84 --> 5584.400000000001
it was cool

5584.48 --> 5588.04
what are you doing clutch

5600.08 --> 5603.84
oh

5601.12 --> 5603.84
okay

5615.199 --> 5620.5599999999995
can you summarize that

5617.92 --> 5622.96
from philip k dick simulation theory

5620.56 --> 5625.52
what does that mean

5622.96 --> 5628.56
was that an admission that effectively

5625.52 --> 5630.719
the science fiction is a simulation or

5628.56 --> 5633.84
it look what

5630.719 --> 5638.639
simulation theory is getting super mixed

5633.84 --> 5641.679
up okay super hard right now simulation

5638.639 --> 5644.719
theory is becoming so scattered in what

5641.679 --> 5647.6
it actually implies and means now

5644.719 --> 5649.28
that you can't just say

5647.6 --> 5653.52
simulation

5649.28 --> 5656.0
anymore without very specific context

5653.52 --> 5658.56
right you got to be careful because one

5656.0 --> 5661.12
simulation theory is not the same as the

5658.56 --> 5665.120000000001
other they're like extremely opposite

5661.12 --> 5667.679
right so which simulation theory

5665.12 --> 5669.76
the theory that there's a simulation in

5667.679 --> 5672.56
our minds through our collective

5669.76 --> 5676.159000000001
imagination that convinces us that our

5672.56 --> 5679.04
imagination is real or is it oh

5676.159 --> 5681.28
this physical reality is like not real

5679.04 --> 5684.0
at all and this is actually a sub

5681.28 --> 5687.92
reality from the real reality and

5684.0 --> 5689.92
it is a simulation like the matrix movie

5687.92 --> 5691.679
right so

5689.92 --> 5694.639
which one

5691.679 --> 5694.639
how are you gonna see it

5695.76 --> 5698.719
right or is it

5698.8 --> 5703.52
because i think that

5700.88 --> 5705.36
the physical reality has simulatory

5703.52 --> 5707.119000000001
traits

5705.36 --> 5711.839999999999
like

5707.119 --> 5711.839999999999
the way the the matter is built up

5712.84 --> 5715.679
seems

5714.8 --> 5718.159000000001
very

5715.679 --> 5720.8
like similar to how

5718.159 --> 5722.96
a simulation in a computer game for

5720.8 --> 5725.04
example is built up

5722.96 --> 5729.36
the similarities

5725.04 --> 5731.92
are becoming interesting and weird

5729.36 --> 5734.639
that there is just at some point where

5731.92 --> 5735.679
for example material

5734.639 --> 5739.36
really

5735.679 --> 5741.92
becomes just intangible

5739.36 --> 5744.08
like it is unattainable there is no

5741.92 --> 5745.92
super microscopic world i think that all

5744.08 --> 5748.0
of that is a lie

5745.92 --> 5750.2390000000005
i think it's all a lie about that

5748.0 --> 5755.119
nonsense even with the quarks i think

5750.239 --> 5759.28
it's all lies all [ __ ] speculation

5755.119 --> 5759.28
no cohesion it's all [ __ ]

5760.32 --> 5765.199
i think that if you with matter after

5763.36 --> 5766.639
you go beyond the

5765.199 --> 5769.5199999999995
proton

5766.639 --> 5771.679
neutron electron stage

5769.52 --> 5776.0
beyond that scale

5771.679 --> 5777.52
like it just stops it becomes

5776.0 --> 5779.679
like bits

5777.52 --> 5782.4800000000005
in a computer program where it's just

5779.679 --> 5785.28
like no you can't [ __ ] around with this

5782.48 --> 5787.759999999999
this is just being there to stabilize

5785.28 --> 5787.759999999999
everything

5787.84 --> 5792.32
yeah you just can't go any deeper there

5790.639 --> 5793.679
is no reason

5792.32 --> 5798.96
there is no

5793.679 --> 5801.4400000000005
sub thing it's just there it just

5798.96 --> 5803.44
like a pixel on the screen it's just

5801.44 --> 5804.879999999999
there

5803.44 --> 5808.4
like a bit

5804.88 --> 5810.2390000000005
in data storage it's just there

5808.4 --> 5813.719
and that's it there's no deeper thing

5810.239 --> 5813.718999999999
it's just that

5815.6 --> 5820.639
and that is simulatory it's not a

5818.48 --> 5822.959999999999
simulation because a simulation

5820.639 --> 5824.2390000000005
automatically implies

5822.96 --> 5827.199
that

5824.239 --> 5828.159
it's not real that it is a sub

5827.199 --> 5830.32
thing

5828.159 --> 5832.96
right now whether that is a simulation

5830.32 --> 5834.159
in the mind like our space

5832.96 --> 5836.159
beliefs

5834.159 --> 5837.119
it's a simulation in the mind that we

5836.159 --> 5838.96
share

5837.119 --> 5841.04
that we could that we collectively share

5838.96 --> 5842.08
and believe in and that makes it real to

5841.04 --> 5843.04
us

5842.08 --> 5846.32
or

5843.04 --> 5849.04
that this physical experience is not

5846.32 --> 5851.84
actually a real experience but a

5849.04 --> 5854.159
simulation of another dimension which

5851.84 --> 5857.56
makes this physical reality not real not

5854.159 --> 5857.5599999999995
just the dream

5868.639 --> 5872.32
can affect the past and observations it

5870.96 --> 5874.719
doesn't

5872.32 --> 5875.679
break back

5874.719 --> 5878.0
like

5875.679 --> 5880.639
most of this quantum physics conclusion

5878.0 --> 5881.679
is [ __ ]

5880.639 --> 5883.6
it is

5881.679 --> 5885.1990000000005
there's a lot of presuppositions in

5883.6 --> 5888.0
there

5885.199 --> 5891.44
like for example the very fabric and

5888.0 --> 5892.56
nature of what light is

5891.44 --> 5894.96
yeah

5892.56 --> 5897.84
there's a lot of calculus stuff going on

5894.96 --> 5899.119
based on quantum based on assumption of

5897.84 --> 5900.639
light as

5899.119 --> 5903.36
like an atom

5900.639 --> 5903.36
which it isn't

5903.679 --> 5908.8
and there's even like weird data like

5905.84 --> 5910.32
for example of the speed of light

5908.8 --> 5911.84
that is assumed right there's

5910.32 --> 5914.5599999999995
presuppositions

5911.84 --> 5917.04
that eventually when pulled into quantum

5914.56 --> 5919.92
mechanical setups

5917.04 --> 5922.0
come to these stupid conclusions where

5919.92 --> 5924.4800000000005
everything oh it's so quantum oh

5922.0 --> 5927.04
everything is possible now

5924.48 --> 5929.599999999999
oh we literally create reality by

5927.04 --> 5931.84
looking at it yep that's all but just

5929.6 --> 5932.88
squirting [ __ ]

5931.84 --> 5934.719
that's

5932.88 --> 5936.0
science fiction

5934.719 --> 5938.4
quantum

5936.0 --> 5940.96
science fiction nonsense

5938.4 --> 5943.04
like oh two particles existing

5940.96 --> 5945.28
in two different spaces at the same time

5943.04 --> 5949.92
yeah right

5945.28 --> 5953.599999999999
right [ __ ] [ __ ] all [ __ ] math

5949.92 --> 5957.1990000000005
based [ __ ] that's what that is

5953.6 --> 5960.56
quantum science fiction the next level

5957.199 --> 5960.5599999999995
of nutty nonsense

5964.4 --> 5971.28
it is nonsense all that stuff it's all

5967.44 --> 5973.759999999999
based on weird like atomic approach of

5971.28 --> 5975.599999999999
light and all that [ __ ] it's garbage

5973.76 --> 5977.76
it's nonsense

5975.6 --> 5979.76
i don't trust those people that even did

5977.76 --> 5982.0
that

5979.76 --> 5985.119000000001
i have no full confirmation that even

5982.0 --> 5989.44
the knowing which path

5985.119 --> 5991.759999999999
experiment is actually physically real

5989.44 --> 5995.44
without meddling

5991.76 --> 5998.08
without wizards setting it up for you

5995.44 --> 6000.08
to experience it like that

5998.08 --> 6001.92
without you

6000.08 --> 6004.639
actually being able to be part of the

6001.92 --> 6007.1990000000005
experiment and fudge around with it

6004.639 --> 6009.84
to test whether it is actually real by

6007.199 --> 6009.839999999999
your own hand

6010.08 --> 6012.32
right

6013.04 --> 6016.88
so

6014.4 --> 6019.599999999999
i don't really care

6016.88 --> 6020.96
if these weird conclusions about the

6019.6 --> 6023.76
past and

6020.96 --> 6025.76
we can affect the past

6023.76 --> 6028.320000000001
these weird conclusions based on

6025.76 --> 6030.639
supposed quantum mechanical research

6028.32 --> 6033.04
those claims are made that's science

6030.639 --> 6035.679
fiction nonsense i don't trust that at

6033.04 --> 6037.84
all it's [ __ ]

6035.679 --> 6040.84
right how are they even concluding that

6037.84 --> 6040.84
retroactive

6041.04 --> 6044.4
affecting like how do they even conclude

6043.6 --> 6047.280000000001
it

6044.4 --> 6047.28
makes no sense

6048.0 --> 6052.8
it's it's just mathematical wizardry

6054.159 --> 6058.0
you don't affect things in the past like

6057.199 --> 6060.5599999999995
that

6058.0 --> 6064.199
through experiment you don't you just

6060.56 --> 6064.1990000000005
don't it's [ __ ]

6066.719 --> 6070.8
right

6068.0 --> 6072.0
the only thing that can be retroactively

6070.8 --> 6075.4800000000005
affected

6072.0 --> 6075.48
is your mind

6083.52 --> 6089.119000000001
where you can literally through inside

6086.639 --> 6091.4400000000005
rearrange how you

6089.119 --> 6092.639
learn things and then switch it all

6091.44 --> 6095.678999999999
around

6092.639 --> 6097.679
then remember it differently

6095.679 --> 6100.679
through the newly attained knowledge

6097.679 --> 6100.679
reintegrated

6117.199 --> 6122.5599999999995
that's nonsense steamy traveler

6119.6 --> 6122.56
that isn't true

6132.719 --> 6136.119
be right there

6224.719 --> 6228.84
get some fresh air guys

6233.92 --> 6237.52
uh the wind is all still

6237.92 --> 6240.4
exit

6240.639 --> 6244.52
stuff to breathe here

6246.239 --> 6251.28
right but yeah to get back to your

6248.08 --> 6253.199
steamy traveler no modern computers

6251.28 --> 6256.48
have nothing to do with quantum

6253.199 --> 6258.879999999999
mechanics that's engineering it's all

6256.48 --> 6261.28
physical engineering trial and error

6258.88 --> 6264.08
trial and error figuring it out

6261.28 --> 6266.639
figuring out patterns

6264.08 --> 6268.5599999999995
and i'm sure that a lot of it has been

6266.639 --> 6269.679
inspired

6268.56 --> 6272.2390000000005
on

6269.679 --> 6274.719
data that was collected in quantum

6272.239 --> 6276.638999999999
mechanical research

6274.719 --> 6279.119
but that doesn't make

6276.639 --> 6282.32
quantum mechanical research the thing

6279.119 --> 6284.719
that made it possible

6282.32 --> 6289.719
it probably gave it a bit of a nudge in

6284.719 --> 6289.719
the development of it and that's it

6312.88 --> 6315.88
what

6318.08 --> 6321.6
with

6319.119 --> 6324.96
something with which path the light

6321.6 --> 6326.8
takes what what are you talking about

6324.96 --> 6328.56
i think that's a different type of light

6326.8 --> 6331.1990000000005
that you're referring to

6328.56 --> 6332.2390000000005
enlightenment

6331.199 --> 6334.48
that's not

6332.239 --> 6336.718999999999
i don't think that the knowing which

6334.48 --> 6338.08
path experiment

6336.719 --> 6341.08
applies to

6338.08 --> 6341.08
enlightenment

6354.639 --> 6359.2390000000005
but yeah go ahead and research it more

6379.44 --> 6383.759999999999
so yeah steamy traveler why the hell did

6381.52 --> 6386.0
you ask that question

6383.76 --> 6388.56
i want to know why did you say that are

6386.0 --> 6390.8
computers fake

6388.56 --> 6392.639
why why would you ask me so that's a

6390.8 --> 6394.400000000001
trope that's a troll

6392.639 --> 6397.400000000001
statement why the hell would you say

6394.4 --> 6397.4
that

6400.159 --> 6402.96
i mean

6401.119 --> 6405.04
a lot of the times now when you insert

6402.96 --> 6407.76
questions you just add these weird

6405.04 --> 6412.119
little things in there

6407.76 --> 6412.119000000001
and i don't understand why

6423.52 --> 6431.119000000001
because i said quantum mechanics is fake

6428.08 --> 6433.92
well the way the conclusions drawn from

6431.119 --> 6435.5199999999995
it in many ways yeah i do think it's

6433.92 --> 6438.4
fake and i think

6435.52 --> 6441.76
that a lot of it is based on like atomic

6438.4 --> 6442.638999999999
thinking falsely

6441.76 --> 6445.280000000001
right

6442.639 --> 6449.92
you have to realize that most quantum

6445.28 --> 6451.92
mechanical based research involves light

6449.92 --> 6454.8
yeah

6451.92 --> 6457.119
and it involves a very specific

6454.8 --> 6459.84
assumption of how

6457.119 --> 6463.199
and what light is

6459.84 --> 6466.32
that rolls out all these weird

6463.199 --> 6469.839999999999
quantum thinking based conclusions

6466.32 --> 6473.04
that are like blatantly

6469.84 --> 6475.76
yeah two particles are not

6473.04 --> 6477.76
in two like the same part is not gonna

6475.76 --> 6481.84
be in two different locations at the

6477.76 --> 6484.400000000001
same time yeah that's uniquely derived

6481.84 --> 6486.0
from quantum mechanical

6484.4 --> 6486.879999999999
speculation

6486.0 --> 6488.8
yeah

6486.88 --> 6490.4800000000005
you're saying that's not [ __ ] that

6488.8 --> 6493.88
that's real

6490.48 --> 6493.879999999999
what's your evidence

6498.08 --> 6503.44
and yeah leave out the presuppositions

6500.719 --> 6503.44
while you're at it

6503.92 --> 6506.2390000000005
yeah

6506.88 --> 6512.05
what is like infinitely divisible beams

6510.4 --> 6513.28
that are instantaneous

6512.05 --> 6516.08
[Music]

6513.28 --> 6518.5599999999995
have no registerable speed

6516.08 --> 6520.159
they're instantaneously and they have no

6518.56 --> 6523.4400000000005
minimum size

6520.159 --> 6524.5599999999995
infinitely small potentially

6523.44 --> 6525.678999999999
yeah

6524.56 --> 6527.84
now

6525.679 --> 6528.88
figure that one out

6527.84 --> 6531.84
see

6528.88 --> 6534.0
with that angle of approach

6531.84 --> 6538.08
insert everything that's done in quantum

6534.0 --> 6540.48
mechanics through that beams of what

6538.08 --> 6542.0
it's light what

6540.48 --> 6544.879999999999
you're going to ask the same question

6542.0 --> 6548.239
about oh light is a particle

6544.88 --> 6549.52
a particle of what

6548.239 --> 6554.28
light

6549.52 --> 6554.280000000001
a beam of what light what do you think

6557.76 --> 6562.56
light is light

6559.119 --> 6562.5599999999995
it's energy has no mass

6562.639 --> 6567.76
it is instantaneous

6565.679 --> 6569.679
it is

6567.76 --> 6572.4800000000005
generated

6569.679 --> 6575.1990000000005
through atomic activity with electricity

6572.48 --> 6578.718999999999
all that or combustion

6575.199 --> 6581.28
instantly transmitted

6578.719 --> 6584.4
crossing wherever it can go splitting up

6581.28 --> 6586.88
indefinitely until reabsorbed

6584.4 --> 6589.199
and then transformed into

6586.88 --> 6592.639
another form of energy that's going to

6589.199 --> 6594.638999999999
be settling on within the matter

6592.639 --> 6596.88
yeah that's what it is circular

6594.639 --> 6599.84
reasoning what the [ __ ] are you doing

6596.88 --> 6599.84
steamy traveler

6600.96 --> 6605.76
what do you mean circular reasoning why

6603.44 --> 6607.839999999999
are you trying to insult my intelligence

6605.76 --> 6610.8
here you think i bring up these

6607.84 --> 6612.88
statements like some random shitty

6610.8 --> 6614.400000000001
remark that i think i can just bluff

6612.88 --> 6617.1990000000005
some [ __ ]

6614.4 --> 6620.159
you think i bring these statements up

6617.199 --> 6623.199
like a bluff steamy traveler

6620.159 --> 6625.199
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you man

6623.199 --> 6628.638999999999
i've already

6625.199 --> 6631.36
explained every subject i've ever

6628.639 --> 6634.56
brought to the table

6631.36 --> 6637.44
why are you acting like this towards me

6634.56 --> 6640.56
how [ __ ] dare you accuse me of

6637.44 --> 6640.5599999999995
circular reasoning

6640.719 --> 6644.8
don't you stop projecting

6642.96 --> 6648.159
yeah

6644.8 --> 6650.719
maybe maybe just take a time out

6648.159 --> 6652.4
and never do that again

6650.719 --> 6655.119
yeah

6652.4 --> 6657.44
how [ __ ] dare you accuse me of

6655.119 --> 6661.36
circular reasoning

6657.44 --> 6661.36
i'm not circular reasoning

6665.76 --> 6671.360000000001
next i'm just gonna kick you out this is

6668.239 --> 6674.638999999999
not good questions steamy traveler this

6671.36 --> 6678.159
is not good this is not helpful

6674.639 --> 6681.84
you're sliding into acting like a troll

6678.159 --> 6681.839999999999
i'm not accepting that

6682.56 --> 6687.52
you understand

6683.92 --> 6687.52
don't talk to me like that again

6688.4 --> 6692.759999999999
it's your final warning

6695.84 --> 6699.4400000000005
and light band clutch no

6698.4 --> 6700.44
it can't

6699.44 --> 6703.5
change its angle

6700.44 --> 6703.5
[Music]

6704.4 --> 6710.0
it does not bend steady though

6707.52 --> 6712.88
unless the medium was

6710.0 --> 6716.0
specifically designed for it to just

6712.88 --> 6718.32
constantly change refraction index which

6716.0 --> 6720.48
would then make it bend

6718.32 --> 6724.159
but that's a highly artificial setup

6720.48 --> 6724.159
that doesn't actually happen in nature

6726.239 --> 6733.199
so no light does not bend

6729.679 --> 6733.1990000000005
and change angle though

6734.08 --> 6740.1
it's based on the refraction index

6737.52 --> 6746.579000000001
of a medium transition

6740.1 --> 6746.579000000001
[Music]

6764.08 --> 6768.639
change the path

6766.32 --> 6771.28
light takes from the future what the

6768.639 --> 6775.4800000000005
hell rig back

6771.28 --> 6775.48
what the hell does that even mean

6778.8 --> 6783.1990000000005
the feud that makes no sense

6780.96 --> 6785.92
besides path

6783.199 --> 6788.4
it's instantaneous there is no speed it

6785.92 --> 6791.719
doesn't travel

6788.4 --> 6791.719
it's instantaneous

6795.28 --> 6801.44
yeah you're welcome clutch

6797.28 --> 6801.44
thank you for a reasonable question

6802.4 --> 6807.839999999999
there's some people out there that have

6804.08 --> 6807.84
a lot of trouble with that apparently

6808.0 --> 6814.32
how dare i question quantum mechanics

6811.92 --> 6816.96
even though i have very detailed

6814.32 --> 6819.119
criticism about it

6816.96 --> 6821.199
how dare i do that

6819.119 --> 6822.799999999999
and what the hell is wrong with you

6821.199 --> 6825.919999999999
reifying

6822.8 --> 6827.76
science into electronics

6825.92 --> 6830.32
i mean that's

6827.76 --> 6832.56
that's a baller

6830.32 --> 6835.84
statement that's dumb

6832.56 --> 6835.84
to say that that's wrong

6835.92 --> 6843.1990000000005
yeah science did not create computers

6840.88 --> 6843.1990000000005
yeah

6844.4 --> 6850.879999999999
computers are engineering you see which

6848.159 --> 6855.36
is completely different

6850.88 --> 6858.4800000000005
it's not science it's engineering or

6855.36 --> 6861.119
colloquially applied sciences you could

6858.48 --> 6862.799999999999
call it it's not science

6861.119 --> 6864.5599999999995
like what kind of statement is it do

6862.8 --> 6868.0
they couldn't make computers if it

6864.56 --> 6870.0
wasn't for quantum mechanics [ __ ]

6868.0 --> 6872.159
[ __ ] yeah

6870.0 --> 6874.48
computers existed before freaking

6872.159 --> 6877.5199999999995
quantum mechanics dude

6874.48 --> 6879.839999999999
the hell's wrong with you

6877.52 --> 6881.599
it already had like switch machines and

6879.84 --> 6885.04
[ __ ] like even

6881.599 --> 6888.599
before the freaking world war ii

6885.04 --> 6888.599
total nonsense

6896.04 --> 6899.54
[Music]

6915.76 --> 6922.2390000000005
i can make a decision that affects the

6918.159 --> 6926.5199999999995
results of an experiment already ran how

6922.239 --> 6926.5199999999995
i don't believe a word of it

6931.97 --> 6935.029
[Music]

6958.84 --> 6965.0
oh

6960.639 --> 6965.0
already had almost two hours

6980.639 --> 6985.679
today's show certainly has been all over

6982.56 --> 6987.76
the place interesting though

6985.679 --> 6990.32
really hope you guys are appreciating

6987.76 --> 6990.320000000001
what i do

6996.0 --> 7002.239
i got a little paypal donation from

6999.04 --> 7004.64
good servant thank you for that

7002.239 --> 7006.799999999999
that's really nice

7004.64 --> 7012.1990000000005
[Music]

7006.8 --> 7012.1990000000005
i never expect that but it's pretty cool

7016.32 --> 7021.5199999999995
right if anybody else could help out

7018.639 --> 7022.400000000001
concerning that i still

7021.52 --> 7026.080000000001
have

7022.4 --> 7026.08
some financial issues

7026.4 --> 7030.159
i'm

7027.36 --> 7031.759999999999
waiting on the jedi's transfer to still

7030.159 --> 7033.36
go through i have no idea how long

7031.76 --> 7035.04
that's going to take

7033.36 --> 7037.119
but it's it's not going to be anything

7035.04 --> 7038.639
like paypal that's for sure if i was

7037.119 --> 7040.88
really quick

7038.639 --> 7043.04
but i guess a direct

7040.88 --> 7044.8
bank transfer can take a lot longer

7043.04 --> 7046.08
because

7044.8 --> 7049.599
it's now

7046.08 --> 7049.599
like three days already

7049.92 --> 7055.84
anyway i really hope that is gonna work

7052.48 --> 7058.5599999999995
out though because i could really use it

7055.84 --> 7060.2390000000005
so yeah if you can donate to me then

7058.56 --> 7062.719
please do so

7060.239 --> 7065.119
i could yeah sign up with patreon i

7062.719 --> 7068.719
don't have a lot of people on patreon

7065.119 --> 7071.719
not that i'm like a super fan of patreon

7068.719 --> 7071.719
but

7072.08 --> 7076.88
i thought that more people would sign on

7074.32 --> 7079.84
with that eventually but it's been kind

7076.88 --> 7079.84
of small so

7081.84 --> 7088.32
quantum eraser delayed choice yeah i

7084.88 --> 7088.32
don't believe a word of that thing

7089.36 --> 7093.239
never witnessed it

7114.719 --> 7120.32
there is no such thing

7117.119 --> 7120.32
quantum scale

7120.56 --> 7127.400000000001
that's not a scale

7123.119 --> 7127.4
quantum is not a scale

7128.639 --> 7132.4800000000005
just because it's smaller does it mean

7130.48 --> 7135.04
suddenly it's quantum this is all

7132.48 --> 7135.04
nonsense

7135.84 --> 7140.0
right

7136.719 --> 7142.56
yeah if it's nanometer

7140.0 --> 7144.56
effects and oh yeah electrons there

7142.56 --> 7146.320000000001
might be weird little things yeah and

7144.56 --> 7147.52
they could still learn from quantum

7146.32 --> 7149.759999999999
mechanics

7147.52 --> 7151.4400000000005
when they apply

7149.76 --> 7153.360000000001
engineering

7151.44 --> 7154.638999999999
has nothing to do

7153.36 --> 7158.5599999999995
directly

7154.639 --> 7158.56
with the quantum mechanics

7160.239 --> 7165.04
it's just data like how

7164.08 --> 7168.239
is

7165.04 --> 7170.32
it going to be influenced when you do

7168.239 --> 7174.44
that it eventually comes to just trial

7170.32 --> 7174.44
and error they just test it

7198.56 --> 7202.080000000001
it

7199.679 --> 7205.52
this is weird all this reification with

7202.08 --> 7206.719
quantum mechanics it it's not

7205.52 --> 7207.84
the

7206.719 --> 7210.2390000000005
source

7207.84 --> 7213.119000000001
of computers

7210.239 --> 7214.879999999999
it isn't not even the micro computers

7213.119 --> 7218.36
that we have now that are just

7214.88 --> 7221.599
incredibly small it's all

7218.36 --> 7222.719
engineering it's all trial and error

7221.599 --> 7225.1990000000005
develop

7222.719 --> 7227.28
they just try it out they just try out

7225.199 --> 7229.36
smaller and even smaller they find oh

7227.28 --> 7230.88
look there's these distortions well

7229.36 --> 7232.48
let's see how we can fix these

7230.88 --> 7235.599
distortions

7232.48 --> 7238.4
okay oh it worked out it's stable now

7235.599 --> 7240.2390000000005
okay let's try even smaller

7238.4 --> 7242.0
and get it even smaller oh look there's

7240.239 --> 7244.0
a new distortion on this level well

7242.0 --> 7246.48
let's try to compensate for that right

7244.0 --> 7248.48
based on previous distortions

7246.48 --> 7250.32
it might be the same oh look there's a

7248.48 --> 7254.48
very specific pattern to how these

7250.32 --> 7257.84
distortion pop up depending on the scale

7254.48 --> 7262.239
it's engineering it's trial and error it

7257.84 --> 7264.32
has nothing to do with quantum mechanics

7262.239 --> 7267.5599999999995
at all

7264.32 --> 7267.5599999999995
it's nonsense

7269.44 --> 7272.678999999999
come on

7328.47 --> 7331.579000000001
[Music]

7360.719 --> 7365.36
yeah i think i'm gonna round out the

7362.08 --> 7367.679
show today's show had very little to do

7365.36 --> 7370.239
with the spiritual psychological civil

7367.679 --> 7370.2390000000005
war though

7370.32 --> 7373.04
that was still based on

7371.68 --> 7374.320000000001
[Music]

7373.04 --> 7376.719
oh well on the statement i made

7374.32 --> 7378.799999999999
yesterday but i did not talk about that

7376.719 --> 7380.639
[ __ ] today as much

7378.8 --> 7382.2390000000005
don't i don't really feel like getting

7380.639 --> 7384.0
angry

7382.239 --> 7386.638999999999
at it because yeah i've been kind of

7384.0 --> 7389.28

7386.639 --> 7391.76
and still recovering

7389.28 --> 7394.5599999999995
silly that that happened

7391.76 --> 7398.1990000000005
but yeah i talked about about a lot of

7394.56 --> 7398.1990000000005
other things instead

7408.8 --> 7412.719
that's right rig back that's a very

7410.48 --> 7414.879999999999
sensible

7412.719 --> 7417.44
angle of approach

7414.88 --> 7417.4400000000005
that's right

7421.04 --> 7425.04
oh

7422.56 --> 7426.8

[Music]

7445.119 --> 7450.32
i do my best

7447.679 --> 7453.04
i don't even really compare myself to

7450.32 --> 7453.04
others like that

7462.88 --> 7467.4400000000005
flat earth kicks one's ego out of the

7465.44 --> 7470.0
park well yeah you have to just to

7467.44 --> 7472.079
survive

7470.0 --> 7474.079
jim bob doesn't mean jordan peters yeah

7472.079 --> 7475.759999999999
dude absolutely

7474.079 --> 7477.04
yesterday i think he had to stream two

7475.76 --> 7479.04
yesterday and then

7477.04 --> 7480.56
he even played like an actual clip of

7479.04 --> 7482.4
jordan peterson

7480.56 --> 7484.88
before he started to do his own voice

7482.4 --> 7487.839999999999
again and was like holy [ __ ] i didn't

7484.88 --> 7490.159000000001
know he actually sounded so close to

7487.84 --> 7492.96
what how jim bob does it

7490.159 --> 7495.199
like holy [ __ ]

7492.96 --> 7497.84
i was thought that jim bob's version was

7495.199 --> 7501.119
kind of a bit of a caricature you know

7497.84 --> 7504.159000000001
but it's like holy [ __ ] it's really like

7501.119 --> 7504.159
that crazy

7504.96 --> 7509.44
gods

7506.88 --> 7511.84
freaking jordan peterson what an

7509.44 --> 7511.839999999999
ugh

7512.159 --> 7515.159
numkey

7527.36 --> 7532.5599999999995
yeah yeah i am angry at the messenger

7529.52 --> 7535.040000000001
you made a personal direct accusation

7532.56 --> 7536.96
twice steamy traveler if you're gonna

7535.04 --> 7538.88
give me a lip about it i'm gonna kick

7536.96 --> 7541.36
you the [ __ ] out of my channel you

7538.88 --> 7541.36
understand

7542.159 --> 7546.159
yeah i do work at a higher level

7545.199 --> 7548.799999999999
you

7546.159 --> 7551.839999999999
called me you said i was circular

7548.8 --> 7554.639
reasoning okay dick

7551.84 --> 7556.0
without any [ __ ] reason to do so

7554.639 --> 7559.679
yeah

7556.0 --> 7563.44
one more time steamy traveler one more

7559.679 --> 7566.159
[ __ ] bad lip work and you're out

7563.44 --> 7569.598999999999
you hear me i do not need your questions

7566.159 --> 7569.598999999999
that much you get it

7569.84 --> 7575.2390000000005
now sit down and shut the [ __ ] up

7578.159 --> 7584.239
i don't care what the claim of people is

7581.76 --> 7587.04
or even in wikipedia

7584.239 --> 7591.32
about electronics or anything yeah i

7587.04 --> 7591.32
don't give a [ __ ] what they say

7591.599 --> 7596.639
engineering is engineering and science

7595.119 --> 7598.96
is science

7596.639 --> 7598.96
yeah

7599.84 --> 7608.32
engineering works outside of science

7604.239 --> 7610.159
it's not possible because of science

7608.32 --> 7611.5199999999995
it's the engineering

7610.159 --> 7613.92
what they do

7611.52 --> 7616.4800000000005
trial and error that actually makes it

7613.92 --> 7617.92
work now they can say oh this is because

7616.48 --> 7619.4
of quantum mechanics you know what that

7617.92 --> 7622.88
is it's called

7619.4 --> 7626.079
advertising because quantum mechanics is

7622.88 --> 7628.2390000000005
so inspiring it's like the super science

7626.079 --> 7630.799999999999
it's science plus where it gets so

7628.239 --> 7632.718999999999
complicated nobody knows any [ __ ]

7630.8 --> 7635.04
thing about it but they were very

7632.719 --> 7637.679
impressed they just say look

7635.04 --> 7640.96
our latest computers are so super

7637.679 --> 7643.28
complicated and engineery that it's like

7640.96 --> 7645.599
quantum

7643.28 --> 7647.679
yeah that sells because people are

7645.599 --> 7649.52
[ __ ] [ __ ] and they don't know how

7647.679 --> 7654.36
things actually work

7649.52 --> 7654.360000000001
that's why it's called advertisement

7663.84 --> 7667.52
yeah okay bye

7666.159 --> 7668.96
bye indeed

7667.52 --> 7669.650000000001
[ __ ] off

7668.96 --> 7671.28
done with you

7669.65 --> 7673.679
[Music]

7671.28 --> 7676.96
you don't actually support me

7673.679 --> 7679.119
yeah you haven't donated even once

7676.96 --> 7683.599
and you give me [ __ ] lip like this

7679.119 --> 7683.598999999999
that is completely uncalled for

7687.679 --> 7692.159
i mean circular reasoning is quite an

7690.4 --> 7694.96
accusation yeah

7692.159 --> 7697.44
now if you said i was circular reasoning

7694.96 --> 7699.199
as i was trying to give a ballwin

7697.44 --> 7702.5599999999995
argument yeah

7699.199 --> 7705.839999999999
i get that yeah when i'm not doing a

7702.56 --> 7709.119000000001
ball one ball win argument however that

7705.84 --> 7710.639
is pretty much the most grave insult

7709.119 --> 7712.96
you could make

7710.639 --> 7712.96
yeah

7713.52 --> 7718.2390000000005
it's literally saying yeah you do not

7715.52 --> 7721.280000000001
abide by logic yeah that's a grave

7718.239 --> 7723.598999999999
insult to me you don't do that if you do

7721.28 --> 7725.679
that again i'll smack you in your

7723.599 --> 7730.04
[ __ ] face you hear me because you

7725.679 --> 7730.04
don't have respect ben

7731.679 --> 7737.119
if i'm circular reasoning you better

7734.32 --> 7739.44
[ __ ] well write an essay describing

7737.119 --> 7741.36
exactly how

7739.44 --> 7745.839999999999
yeah

7741.36 --> 7745.839999999999
you better damn well prove it then

7750.67 --> 7755.599
[Music]

7752.96 --> 7755.599
yeah aaron

7755.679 --> 7761.04
projecting probably but it's just

7758.56 --> 7762.4800000000005
you shouldn't do that

7761.04 --> 7766.079
ever

7762.48 --> 7767.759999999999
for any reason even if you feel like

7766.079 --> 7770.719
just if you feel

7767.76 --> 7772.56
then just shut your [ __ ] mouth just

7770.719 --> 7776.159
shut the [ __ ] up

7772.56 --> 7779.76
don't say anything if only gamma garbage

7776.159 --> 7781.36
is gonna come out then shut your [ __ ]

7779.76 --> 7784.4800000000005
mouth

7781.36 --> 7787.28
don't be an ass

7784.48 --> 7790.718999999999
shut the [ __ ] up if nothing good comes

7787.28 --> 7790.719
out then shut the [ __ ] up

7791.04 --> 7794.48
get it

7792.639 --> 7799.079
if you don't get that

7794.48 --> 7799.079
what the hell are you even doing here

7805.199 --> 7808.199
right

7818.48 --> 7823.04
that's right

7820.96 --> 7826.0
if you can't say anything that's gonna

7823.04 --> 7828.8
contribute then don't say anything

7826.0 --> 7829.76
if you're gonna make an accusation

7828.8 --> 7833.92
right

7829.76 --> 7833.92
you must prove your accusation

7834.0 --> 7838.4
because if you don't then you're not

7836.079 --> 7840.159
contributing you're literally slandering

7838.4 --> 7844.48
then right

7840.159 --> 7844.48
an accusation not proven is slander

7847.119 --> 7851.04
so if you actually have an accusation

7848.96 --> 7854.4800000000005
then figure out before you say it

7851.04 --> 7856.96
whether it's actually true or not

7854.48 --> 7858.4
and then describe

7856.96 --> 7861.199
how

7858.4 --> 7865.799999999999
what it is because if you don't you're

7861.199 --> 7865.799999999999
just a slandering liar

7871.84 --> 7875.84
what did you miss you don't miss

7873.679 --> 7877.679
anything you're a troll bastard cycle

7875.84 --> 7880.2390000000005
you lied to me

7877.679 --> 7882.32
you lied to me last time about donating

7880.239 --> 7887.239
to me you didn't you're a liar you're a

7882.32 --> 7887.239
troll get the [ __ ] outta here scum

7894.83 --> 7898.0
[Music]

7909.119 --> 7913.598999999999
yeah iron

7910.84 --> 7916.400000000001
anyway it's like not the first time he's

7913.599 --> 7918.88
done anything like this

7916.4 --> 7921.36
it's just that he's decided that when

7918.88 --> 7923.1990000000005
he's in a shitty gamma mood he's just

7921.36 --> 7926.96
gonna give into it

7923.199 --> 7929.36
like he's just gonna be that dick

7926.96 --> 7931.599
that's inacceptable you can't do that

7929.36 --> 7933.5199999999995
here

7931.599 --> 7935.599
yeah

7933.52 --> 7937.76
you can do that with your therapist

7935.599 --> 7939.119000000001
that's where if you have a need to be a

7937.76 --> 7941.84
dick

7939.119 --> 7944.48
then go to your therapist and express

7941.84 --> 7947.04
how you have the need to be a dick

7944.48 --> 7950.5599999999995
don't do that in my chat if you feel

7947.04 --> 7952.8
like that shut your [ __ ] mouth

7950.56 --> 7955.04
because if you don't you'll get into an

7952.8 --> 7957.92
argument with me you're gonna piss me

7955.04 --> 7960.719
off and then i'm gonna ban you

7957.92 --> 7963.92
so just if you're like that shut your

7960.719 --> 7965.76
[ __ ] mouth and keep it to yourself

7963.92 --> 7968.8
think about it some more

7965.76 --> 7971.52
by what you were gonna say

7968.8 --> 7973.28
and then if it's actually irrelevant

7971.52 --> 7975.4400000000005
it actually turned out to be irrelevant

7973.28 --> 7976.32
then wait until you're not in a dick

7975.44 --> 7978.4
mood

7976.32 --> 7979.759999999999
and then just calmly bring it to the

7978.4 --> 7982.5599999999995
table if you really think it's a

7979.76 --> 7984.4800000000005
relevant issue if you're like a dick

7982.56 --> 7986.96
don't do that

7984.48 --> 7990.48
you're not gonna solve anything

7986.96 --> 7990.4800000000005
you're not gonna help anything

7991.28 --> 7994.96
don't [ __ ] accuse me of circular

7993.28 --> 7998.88
reasoning ever

7994.96 --> 8002.159
ever i have not done that since

7998.88 --> 8002.159000000001
i was like seven

8006.32 --> 8011.639
yeah circular reasoning is for freaking

8008.639 --> 8011.639
hippies

8012.239 --> 8017.199
unless you're like really sensible as a

8015.119 --> 8020.159
hippie

8017.199 --> 8020.159
you know what i mean

8020.719 --> 8024.679

quiet weekend i think

8208.399 --> 8211.84

8209.92 --> 8213.439
catch up on like owen benjamin's streams

8211.84 --> 8216.319
because i haven't watched owen benjamin

8213.439 --> 8218.960000000001

8216.319 --> 8221.84

8218.96 --> 8226.639

8221.84 --> 8257.94
