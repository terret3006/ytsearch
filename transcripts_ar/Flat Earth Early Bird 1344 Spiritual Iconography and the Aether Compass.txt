join button I'll be much appreciated

98.939 --> 101.96
always use it

103.86 --> 109.579
right so you can already guess it's hot

110.579 --> 113.479
there it is

114.18 --> 119.57900000000001
again

115.56 --> 121.32000000000001
a bunch of this weird Haze up there

119.579 --> 124.27999999999999
I don't think that I really don't think

121.32 --> 124.27999999999999
it's Trail related

124.86 --> 129.119
I didn't see it happening at least

127.259 --> 132.72
it's just

129.119 --> 135.26
seem to be kind of clear sky but always

132.72 --> 135.26
this

137.459 --> 143.4
and it only half blocks the Sun so

141.78 --> 146.04
right but

143.4 --> 147.36
beside that there's also a lot of nice

146.04 --> 151.34
wind

147.36 --> 151.34
more regular today than it was yesterday

151.739 --> 154.879
so that helps a bit

154.98 --> 159.5
but it is overall still cooking

164.5 --> 169.519
[Music]

165.86 --> 169.519
any freeze

171.06 --> 173.959
there you go

179.9 --> 185.04
right so hello

183.2 --> 188.17999999999998
jindali

185.04 --> 188.17999999999998
first in chat

188.28 --> 191.78
Insanity sanity

198.48 --> 206.819
it is true oh wait huh Thursday

202.14 --> 206.819
the 25th of August 2022

208.62 --> 211.34
Tuesday

221.099 --> 223.7
all right

234.659 --> 237.26
all right

246.06 --> 251.299
so it's incredibly hot that's also why I

248.819 --> 251.29899999999998
started late

258.12 --> 264.079
it is 31 degrees Celsius yeah I thought

261.299 --> 264.07899999999995
something like that

266.4 --> 271.44
huh

268.199 --> 273.72
okay forecast is that it's gonna cool

271.44 --> 276.66
down 10 degrees

273.72 --> 279.41900000000004
by tomorrow according to the predictions

276.66 --> 284.24
we'll see

279.419 --> 284.24
and by the way these predictions are now

284.88 --> 289.62
constantly looking just different

287.52 --> 291.71999999999997
I'm noticing so their long-term

289.62 --> 294.0
predictions

291.72 --> 298.32000000000005
I think they're just

294.0 --> 302.34
based on the sensible pattern

298.32 --> 305.039
but yeah a week ahead

302.34 --> 307.38
you know when they predict something and

305.039 --> 309.3
then like half a week later they just

307.38 --> 311.1
they got something different for the day

309.3 --> 312.96000000000004
so

311.1 --> 314.759
that's what I'm noticing

312.96 --> 319.02
because

314.759 --> 321.41900000000004
you know I'll present it for a second

319.02 --> 324.79999999999995
this is usually where I go it's just a

321.419 --> 324.79999999999995
Google default

335.12 --> 339.68
oh that's a little big

344.039 --> 346.639
that no

351.9 --> 358.4
right this

354.96 --> 358.4
that's what I'm looking at

371.58 --> 374.18
right

382.38 --> 386.24
hey Matthew Hall good to see you

393.36 --> 398.72
okay

395.16 --> 398.72
Matthew Hall what

401.699 --> 404.36
hmm

413.639 --> 417.66
a good documentary

419.72 --> 426.06
documentary on Giants today cool

424.08 --> 429.8
there's

426.06 --> 429.8
yeah plenty out there

430.979 --> 435.9
I was just watching kind of in the

433.74 --> 437.639
background

435.9 --> 440.29999999999995
Owen Benjamin

437.639 --> 440.3
from yesterday

440.819 --> 446.90000000000003
he had David Weiss

443.099 --> 446.9
and Crow triple seven on

451.139 --> 455.96000000000004
and they were basically deep speculating

456.36 --> 461.66
foreign

457.52 --> 461.65999999999997
thing that I would like to do too

461.759 --> 465.91900000000004
mostly Reserve that for this show

465.96 --> 469.87899999999996
when the energy energy is right

471.3 --> 476.22
but yeah that was pretty pretty

473.819 --> 479.099
interesting so far I haven't I've only

476.22 --> 481.819
watched like half an hour

479.099 --> 481.819
uh

508.319 --> 510.68
huh

512.88 --> 516.32
okay Matthew Hall

523.68 --> 528.8389999999999
right but are you sure they're actually

526.92 --> 531.36
related

528.839 --> 533.399
maybe some ass out there just call

531.36 --> 535.8000000000001
themselves that

533.399 --> 536.29
because he thought oh I'm gonna do it

535.8 --> 539.4499999999999
too

536.29 --> 539.4499999999999
[Music]

539.519 --> 543.86
right and then they would be a trash

541.5 --> 543.86
person

546.12 --> 552.0
but do have you actually identified him

549.36 --> 556.5600000000001
and like looked him up

552.0 --> 560.18
is he actually off the family you're

556.56 --> 560.18
talking about Matthew Hall

577.74 --> 580.64
anyway

581.16 --> 584.6
apj CNET

586.08 --> 590.3000000000001
10 minutes walk home in heavy rain okay

596.58 --> 601.0400000000001
all right so I guess it's raining in

598.86 --> 601.04
England

602.459 --> 608.279
then maybe the weather forecast for it

604.62 --> 611.12
raining tomorrow is not that far off

608.279 --> 611.12
that makes sense

613.26 --> 615.92
huh

632.459 --> 638.76
is a French member

635.76 --> 638.76
oh

639.0 --> 649.86
so he's like one of their house slaves

643.32 --> 649.86
taking on the name literally just yeah

654.3 --> 660.68
right but not born as one

657.6 --> 660.6800000000001
that was my point

661.5 --> 666.74
it's an adopted Ralph child oh goody

686.06 --> 689.4799999999999
right anyway

691.86 --> 694.399
ah

695.279 --> 701.579
sorry anybody who thinks like

698.339 --> 703.5
these shows recently with me without a

701.579 --> 705.3
shirt and are a bit slow

703.5 --> 708.0
at the beginning

705.3 --> 711.24
it's just that this heart is not good

708.0 --> 713.16
for my focus the real problem here is

711.24 --> 717.12
that

713.16 --> 720.42
I got a big brain how dare you

717.12 --> 723.18
oh you don't have any papers

720.42 --> 725.76
yeah I got a big brain it's extremely

723.18 --> 728.76
active I've trained it a lot it has

725.76 --> 731.1
become efficient but

728.76 --> 733.8
heavy thinking and especially heavy

731.1 --> 735.48
Insight moments and then the refinement

733.8 --> 738.42
afterwards

735.48 --> 740.72
like it it tends to kind of generate

738.42 --> 740.7199999999999
Heat

740.88 --> 746.459
no that's a problem in this type of

743.399 --> 750.0
weather it's hot

746.459 --> 752.8199999999999
like it immediately counteracts the

750.0 --> 755.399
after process of actually trying to

752.82 --> 757.8000000000001
collect the data from such a moment

755.399 --> 761.899
so

757.8 --> 761.899
I just seem more slow than usual

764.459 --> 769.8
but if I try to avoid getting over

767.04 --> 772.3199999999999
excited about something then

769.8 --> 773.3389999999999
yeah I won't have to break out and sweat

772.32 --> 775.98
and all that

773.339 --> 777.839
maybe even that helps I don't know

775.98 --> 780.54
it's just I've noticed that when it's

777.839 --> 784.639
hot I function differently

780.54 --> 788.54
all right I got some really nice

784.639 --> 788.54
blueberries woohoo

789.48 --> 795.2
hmm

791.279 --> 795.2
well goes to energy drink

796.98 --> 803.36
some Frosty water

800.04 --> 803.36
that should also help

835.8 --> 843.199
what the capital city in Australia

839.82 --> 843.1990000000001
egg LSG

844.74 --> 847.279
what

849.6 --> 853.519
is that that's like Melbourne right

863.699 --> 868.88
is Melbourne like

866.22 --> 868.88
cooler

874.86 --> 880.6800000000001
than the rest of Australia

877.199 --> 882.3
uh it is it does seem to be like very

880.68 --> 884.699
south

882.3 --> 888.26
or maybe I got it wrong I I thought no

884.699 --> 888.26
one was was it Sydney

889.44 --> 892.5790000000001
right but anyway

894.3 --> 899.8389999999999
the more big cities seem to be all in

897.48 --> 899.839
the south

902.279 --> 905.279
Canberra

905.42 --> 910.16
oh okay

907.62 --> 910.16
what

910.68 --> 913.8199999999999
where is that

919.74 --> 924.0600000000001
huh

921.06 --> 927.38
well it didn't even show up

924.06 --> 927.38
without zooming in

927.72 --> 930.32
that's weird

940.38 --> 946.92
right but anyway it it seems to be in a

943.62 --> 949.5600000000001
much in the biggest green

946.92 --> 952.5
part pretty much of Australia that's

949.56 --> 955.3199999999999
what I'm noticing from map

952.5 --> 958.699
okay so point taken

955.32 --> 958.6990000000001
hello Gadget inspector

959.24 --> 962.839
is I'm sorry

963.0 --> 970.92
I'm sorry I don't I I have absolutely no

967.56 --> 972.779
idea typically about like Australian

970.92 --> 975.54
topography

972.779 --> 979.019
I mean back in the day like I only

975.54 --> 982.259
learned European topography

979.019 --> 985.68
like my own country and Europe

982.259 --> 988.5600000000001
and just because of shared interest and

985.68 --> 990.66
exposure I've learned a lot about oh

988.56 --> 993.42
well a lot I think it's a lot I'm

990.66 --> 995.9399999999999
surprised I gotten this far

993.42 --> 998.639
topography about America about the

995.94 --> 999.72
United States specifically

998.639 --> 1001.279
right

999.72 --> 1004.1800000000001
but I don't know anything about

1001.279 --> 1004.18
Australia really

1004.82 --> 1010.4200000000001
I just know

1006.68 --> 1010.42
ought to recognize the accent

1016.779 --> 1022.899
yeah it is in between those cities

1019.519 --> 1022.899
generally that's right

1058.16 --> 1063.5
yeah an empty in chat

1061.28 --> 1065.6
Australia is in CGI

1063.5 --> 1068.059
and even if it was

1065.6 --> 1070.2199999999998
I'm okay with that because there are

1068.059 --> 1073.28
Australians that actually send me real

1070.22 --> 1076.0
money so whether it's CGI or not it's

1073.28 --> 1076.0
all good with me

1084.02 --> 1086.32
foreign

1101.12 --> 1106.36
it's ridiculous

1102.98 --> 1106.3600000000001
you came up with that [ __ ]

1119.6 --> 1123.8799999999999
used to love geography in school

1124.4 --> 1128.0800000000002
yeah I kind of liked it

1138.919 --> 1144.44
I mean I was very good at it

1142.1 --> 1146.78
when I was young

1144.44 --> 1150.64
like I did get through it

1146.78 --> 1150.6399999999999
like almost perfectly

1152.66 --> 1156.3200000000002
at least when it comes to like the Dutch

1155.0 --> 1159.26
topography

1156.32 --> 1161.48
I wouldn't know it now but I I do

1159.26 --> 1165.26
recognize most

1161.48 --> 1169.299
names of Dutch cities and all that like

1165.26 --> 1169.299
you never really forget but

1170.9 --> 1173.02
um

1176.84 --> 1183.86
all about Maps does it get yeah well I

1180.26 --> 1185.72
love Maps I drew a lot of maps

1183.86 --> 1188.7199999999998
I made Maps

1185.72 --> 1191.559
like when did they start doing that

1188.72 --> 1191.559
it's kind of the

1192.26 --> 1199.66
yeah I think at 13.

1195.32 --> 1199.6599999999999
that's when I really started doing that

1201.799 --> 1206.96
right game maps and I've shown some of

1204.679 --> 1210.02
them here on my show

1206.96 --> 1213.44
these are drawings that are like

1210.02 --> 1217.28
30 years old some of them

1213.44 --> 1219.3200000000002
but other yeah no that's probably not

1217.28 --> 1223.58
true I still have those drunks but

1219.32 --> 1227.96
they're all stacked in boxes in storage

1223.58 --> 1232.34
I did keep like most of my drawings

1227.96 --> 1232.3400000000001
like the ones that actually succeeded

1234.679 --> 1240.26
right but I've kept that up and like

1237.44 --> 1242.419
yeah when I was game mastering use

1240.26 --> 1244.58
playing Dungeons and Dragons

1242.419 --> 1247.3400000000001
using my system

1244.58 --> 1248.299
right that I've made the Thousand page

1247.34 --> 1251.299
book

1248.299 --> 1254.98
then I just reuse it again it's like

1251.299 --> 1254.98
Maps just make maps

1263.799 --> 1269.559
you just

1265.7 --> 1269.559
conjure it

1274.88 --> 1277.88
Stitch

1280.94 --> 1282.94
ES

1297.48 --> 1300.609
[Music]

1300.799 --> 1305.299
right ten

1302.659 --> 1307.2800000000002
the weird thing is is that I don't even

1305.299 --> 1309.02
completely know what it is that I'm

1307.28 --> 1311.6
doing when I'm drawing some of these

1309.02 --> 1314.96
it's like I draw shapes

1311.6 --> 1318.08
then I just tried to 3D visualize what

1314.96 --> 1321.559
it is that I've drawn it's it's like I

1318.08 --> 1324.26
start out claying virtually

1321.559 --> 1327.74
and then

1324.26 --> 1329.96
as you go as you find purpose for a

1327.74 --> 1332.299
place like because you're gonna then

1329.96 --> 1335.299
simulate a person or a group of people

1332.299 --> 1337.8799999999999
being there and getting ambition and

1335.299 --> 1339.32
inspiration to do something with it

1337.88 --> 1341.7800000000002
then

1339.32 --> 1343.76
there's like a secondary design

1341.78 --> 1346.28
modification

1343.76 --> 1348.26
for the original landscape

1346.28 --> 1351.7
and that's how you just keep refining

1348.26 --> 1351.7
that's what I do in my mind

1353.36 --> 1358.299
but I can show some of this just through

1355.82 --> 1358.299
my computer

1386.419 --> 1389.5
there you go

1398.059 --> 1400.6589999999999
right

1402.74 --> 1408.86
it's so funny the order of the design

1405.88 --> 1410.6000000000001
how it Formed because it has just

1408.86 --> 1413.78
several stages

1410.6 --> 1417.26
anyway let me present this this is like

1413.78 --> 1420.86
the main map

1417.26 --> 1423.08
of it all of the the campaign that I

1420.86 --> 1426.279
used to play

1423.08 --> 1426.279
use the game master

1429.62 --> 1433.8999999999999
all right

1431.059 --> 1433.8999999999999
there it is

1444.14 --> 1452.3600000000001
and yeah this is like

1448.64 --> 1454.659
this has undergone like six or seven

1452.36 --> 1454.6589999999999
years

1454.94 --> 1459.44
yeah

1456.2 --> 1461.419
like total seven years of development

1459.44 --> 1464.72
because this was the project that I did

1461.419 --> 1466.3400000000001
with my Gamers until yeah crew knew

1464.72 --> 1468.32
happened and then they kind of just

1466.34 --> 1471.9189999999999
completely scattered and discontinued

1468.32 --> 1474.7
and I hope they're all still alive

1471.919 --> 1474.7
I don't know

1475.039 --> 1482.98
one guy was a nurse and

1478.94 --> 1482.98
really hope he didn't take any shots

1483.679 --> 1488.24
but uh yeah

1486.679 --> 1492.159
this is

1488.24 --> 1492.159
big ones let's see if I can

1499.64 --> 1505.1000000000001
right I can just scroll

1503.179 --> 1507.8200000000002
look at this right

1505.1 --> 1507.82
this

1508.94 --> 1513.88
is just one of the main con this is the

1511.279 --> 1513.88
new world

1519.2 --> 1523.8400000000001
right so it is but it is sort of an

1521.659 --> 1526.7
enactment of the

1523.84 --> 1529.84
exploration phase

1526.7 --> 1533.539
and yeah with actual original

1529.84 --> 1537.3799999999999
occupants and histories and

1533.539 --> 1540.5
kings that are basically just

1537.38 --> 1542.419
at first covertly trying to invade the

1540.5 --> 1543.86
place and then just completely try to

1542.419 --> 1546.5
take over

1543.86 --> 1548.84
and the adventures are in between that

1546.5 --> 1552.62
and they can take up any role they like

1548.84 --> 1554.6
they can become part of that Empire

1552.62 --> 1557.299
or they can be

1554.6 --> 1561.6999999999998
like a beacon of resistance

1557.299 --> 1561.7
that could completely overturn all that

1565.1 --> 1567.34
right

1578.659 --> 1584.38
and I've got a lot of zoomed in

1580.52 --> 1584.3799999999999
scenarios concerning all that

1585.44 --> 1588.3400000000001
oh

1588.62 --> 1592.299
so many drawings man

1609.38 --> 1612.6200000000001
all right so let me give you this

1611.179 --> 1616.9
example

1612.62 --> 1616.8999999999999
zoomed in in a later stage

1616.94 --> 1623.539
like this is actually what happens after

1620.62 --> 1627.02
my Gamers that I spent like seven years

1623.539 --> 1628.58
building this from because I started out

1627.02 --> 1632.9189999999999
in this world with another group of

1628.58 --> 1632.9189999999999
Gamers and that didn't last very long

1633.44 --> 1637.52
then what I did with the new Gamers is

1635.419 --> 1639.74
actually start earlier at the very

1637.52 --> 1643.039
founding

1639.74 --> 1644.659
of the main city you might recognize hey

1643.039 --> 1646.64
wait hold on

1644.659 --> 1649.159
you might recognize

1646.64 --> 1650.659
that the actual landscape looks pretty

1649.159 --> 1652.7
much the same

1650.659 --> 1656.5590000000002
oh by the way I actually

1652.7 --> 1656.559
did show you that version

1656.72 --> 1661.8990000000001
huh

1658.7 --> 1661.8990000000001
to look more careful

1663.919 --> 1666.94
sorry about that

1670.34 --> 1674.86
yeah I think I mixed up these stages

1678.02 --> 1680.5
yeah

1680.6 --> 1686.9599999999998
ancient New World New World

1683.659 --> 1689.1200000000001
ancient New World ancient new world that

1686.96 --> 1691.64
is the actual

1689.12 --> 1695.6
place that the gamers played in in the

1691.64 --> 1699.1000000000001
ancient new world not just the new world

1695.6 --> 1699.1
okay so let me do that again

1700.159 --> 1705.6200000000001
all right so this

1702.38 --> 1708.14
I could show it the way that I've done

1705.62 --> 1710.1789999999999
so this is

1708.14 --> 1711.7990000000002
when the cities are already kind of

1710.179 --> 1713.799
manifested

1711.799 --> 1716.6
right

1713.799 --> 1719.6
agriculture a plenty

1716.6 --> 1722.36
the yellow parts and the green Parts is

1719.6 --> 1724.1
yeah grassy fields and hills and all

1722.36 --> 1726.5
that

1724.1 --> 1728.24
dark green forests

1726.5 --> 1731.059
right this

1728.24 --> 1735.52
I'm gonna show now

1731.059 --> 1735.52
is before all that happened

1737.779 --> 1742.48
sorry this is not a properly set up

1739.88 --> 1742.48
slideshow

1744.08 --> 1749.779
that's this

1746.0 --> 1752.08
see more Forest no large agriculture

1749.779 --> 1752.08
City

1752.299 --> 1756.399
and just a starting Little City

1757.7 --> 1763.24
to over at the the lower middle right

1763.94 --> 1770.6000000000001
because it's like the first arrival

1765.98 --> 1772.3990000000001
there's two starting ports Roth Port yes

1770.6 --> 1775.039
on purpose

1772.399 --> 1777.9189999999999
because the sand is red

1775.039 --> 1781.299
over there because of the rocks

1777.919 --> 1781.2990000000002
the river goes past

1782.14 --> 1787.3400000000001
and Newport

1785.24 --> 1789.02
oh wait no it's called Hammer's Edge I

1787.34 --> 1792.26
forgot

1789.02 --> 1794.24
because it's still a Dwarven settlement

1792.26 --> 1796.8799999999999
Hammer's Edge is a Dwarven settlement

1794.24 --> 1799.46
and the the dwarves have made a deal

1796.88 --> 1801.7990000000002
with the humans

1799.46 --> 1806.72
to have trade because the dwarves in

1801.799 --> 1809.72
this world are very old civilization

1806.72 --> 1812.72
they are basically like the

1809.72 --> 1815.299
Lonely Mountain situation

1812.72 --> 1817.3990000000001
like they've got so much freaking they

1815.299 --> 1819.2
mind everything in their mountain and

1817.399 --> 1821.0
that mountain is like the largest

1819.2 --> 1822.6200000000001
mountain in the world and they

1821.0 --> 1825.08
completely mind it out they haven't

1822.62 --> 1826.8799999999999
bumped into any demons they've fainted

1825.08 --> 1830.059
off dragons

1826.88 --> 1831.98
but they're like in an economic stale

1830.059 --> 1835.94
because

1831.98 --> 1839.299
like they got too much stuff

1835.94 --> 1842.3200000000002
right so they have a weird trade so like

1839.299 --> 1842.32
a trade

1843.039 --> 1848.48
guilt that basically rules it's like the

1846.559 --> 1852.46
king is a trade Guild and there's all

1848.48 --> 1852.46
these rules about trade and taxes

1854.6 --> 1860.779
right that's in the entry point for the

1857.539 --> 1863.36
game as the players which the players in

1860.779 --> 1866.899
this the ancient New World setup will

1863.36 --> 1871.6399999999999
always start at Hammer's Edge

1866.899 --> 1874.58
because yeah the other one Roth part is

1871.64 --> 1877.22
yeah it's kind of a plot device

1874.58 --> 1879.08
it's more like a pirate place it like

1877.22 --> 1881.059
the north involves more Pirates

1879.08 --> 1882.26
eventually the Pirates start nagging

1881.059 --> 1885.5
your city

1882.26 --> 1888.08
or the city that you're part of

1885.5 --> 1890.84
and then they become intertwined and

1888.08 --> 1894.08
then nobilities start like basically

1890.84 --> 1896.72
doing races land inwards and then

1894.08 --> 1899.1399999999999
subterfly yeah anything anything is

1896.72 --> 1899.14
possible

1899.6 --> 1904.779
right

1900.98 --> 1904.779
but this is all like

1904.94 --> 1910.24
50 years or something before the other

1907.82 --> 1910.24
setting

1913.1 --> 1920.539
when it becomes Kingsport

1916.279 --> 1924.679
when there is basically a

1920.539 --> 1929.919
yeah how Kingsport comes to be is

1924.679 --> 1929.919
that the humans basically take over

1930.44 --> 1937.039
the city because of a giant disaster

1933.679 --> 1938.8400000000001
that happens in the the yeah the Dwarven

1937.039 --> 1942.679
Empire

1938.84 --> 1944.779
which literally collapses like as in the

1942.679 --> 1947.019
caves like a big disaster happens they

1944.779 --> 1950.48
get cut off and the humans just take it

1947.019 --> 1952.34
and the local Lord there then declares

1950.48 --> 1955.3990000000001
himself a king

1952.34 --> 1958.4599999999998
and because the race

1955.399 --> 1960.6789999999999
or the land in where it is still going

1958.46 --> 1963.919
and there's a lot of like the

1960.679 --> 1965.96
stalemating going on with Nobles in the

1963.919 --> 1968.8990000000001
old world

1965.96 --> 1971.0
they just kind of give it to him so then

1968.899 --> 1972.6789999999999
it becomes its own little kingdom its

1971.0 --> 1975.2
own little trade Kingdom

1972.679 --> 1976.88
that is still massively outnumbered but

1975.2 --> 1978.2
because of the situation they just get

1976.88 --> 1980.779
it

1978.2 --> 1983.179
right so this is the kind of stuff that

1980.779 --> 1986.6
I used to be occupied with before I like

1983.179 --> 1990.799
got really really

1986.6 --> 1992.48
deeply into like cosmogyny like that was

1990.799 --> 1996.6399999999999
still surface stuff when I was already

1992.48 --> 1999.26
deeply suspended into animating this

1996.64 --> 2002.7990000000002
simulated world

1999.26 --> 2005.519
that I would subject my players to

2002.799 --> 2005.519
uh

2005.559 --> 2011.279
let me compare that

2008.019 --> 2011.279
new world again

2015.399 --> 2017.8799999999999
oh

2032.5 --> 2035.22
boom

2050.26 --> 2058.96
right anyway Maps

2054.339 --> 2062.2599999999998
I uh have experience with that

2058.96 --> 2065.139
oh and by the way yeah

2062.26 --> 2067.7200000000003
it all has its own history that's all

2065.139 --> 2070.179
written in text and [ __ ]

2067.72 --> 2072.9399999999996
I mean

2070.179 --> 2075.94
I just publish it

2072.94 --> 2079.78
if it wasn't still a work in process

2075.94 --> 2081.7000000000003
damn it I'm only halfway through I

2079.78 --> 2083.3790000000004
haven't even thought of anything to

2081.7 --> 2087.399
actually

2083.379 --> 2091.02
finish up the the land inward race like

2087.399 --> 2091.02
the quest for gold port

2091.24 --> 2096.22
I know what's there I know roughly how

2093.339 --> 2100.06
it is but this just haven't been enough

2096.22 --> 2102.22
Dynamics introduced to like have it into

2100.06 --> 2105.0
a flow chart

2102.22 --> 2107.56
uh

2105.0 --> 2112.38
those playing Call of Duty helped build

2107.56 --> 2112.38
up immunity no and the contrary

2125.38 --> 2129.2400000000002
you need to buy prison now

2129.48 --> 2134.7
Gadget inspector this is all sketchy

2136.24 --> 2141.8199999999997
I mean eventually you could just

2139.3 --> 2146.1600000000003
digitize it and I'll make it perfect no

2141.82 --> 2146.1600000000003
I like freaking pencil sketches

2148.119 --> 2154.6600000000003
that's just how I do it pencil sketches

2150.4 --> 2155.6800000000003
I scan it and then I might like use like

2154.66 --> 2158.14
well

2155.68 --> 2161.7999999999997
Photoshop eraser

2158.14 --> 2167.46
perfected out printed out again and then

2161.8 --> 2167.46
draw over that I mean it works great

2170.8 --> 2176.26
and it's all about just getting the feel

2173.44 --> 2178.3
for a shape anyway

2176.26 --> 2180.76
that is what it is that's what this

2178.3 --> 2183.52
cartography thing is it's like the shape

2180.76 --> 2187.42
actually matters even like it may see

2183.52 --> 2190.9
you random but it's seeming Randomness

2187.42 --> 2192.7000000000003
is like the exact code that helps you

2190.9 --> 2195.4
identify

2192.7 --> 2198.7599999999998
the geography

2195.4 --> 2201.76
it's really fascinating

2198.76 --> 2204.0400000000004
how that works this is like that's why

2201.76 --> 2206.32
when I start out drawing a map for the

2204.04 --> 2208.24
first time I just like really almost try

2206.32 --> 2209.92
to draw random [ __ ] not get too

2208.24 --> 2212.859
ballistic

2209.92 --> 2214.06
and then especially if it's like what is

2212.859 --> 2215.859
this

2214.06 --> 2219.88
then

2215.859 --> 2223.96
unless it's just completely unrealistic

2219.88 --> 2226.839
like then it's like typical like

2223.96 --> 2230.099
what you look at on the world map is not

2226.839 --> 2234.64
there to pleasure your aesthetic senses

2230.099 --> 2238.119
it's just the way it is and that feel

2234.64 --> 2241.44
is something you can try to simulate

2238.119 --> 2241.44
when you sketch

2242.8 --> 2245.3390000000004
anyway

2251.619 --> 2254.46
whoa

2256.06 --> 2258.72
cool

2260.26 --> 2265.9
oh at least she just sent me a map that

2262.54 --> 2269.16
he drew very cool I will show that that

2265.9 --> 2269.1600000000003
is pretty damn Epic

2270.46 --> 2275.76
uh

2272.26 --> 2275.76
if that's okay with you

2282.579 --> 2286.9
check that out

2285.16 --> 2289.44
that's at least G

2286.9 --> 2289.44
man

2290.619 --> 2294.0
that is very impressive

2301.119 --> 2307.42
right it's a different style though

2304.18 --> 2311.2
like this is more like the

2307.42 --> 2314.619
the hand cartographer's representation

2311.2 --> 2318.0989999999997
system where you actually draw

2314.619 --> 2321.1600000000003
uh what is it semi-artigraphic like you

2318.099 --> 2323.92
draw mountains as Peaks it's like the

2321.16 --> 2326.14
Lord of the Rings Maps were also drawn

2323.92 --> 2328.3
in that style I have a lot of those

2326.14 --> 2330.8199999999997
types of drawings it's just that

2328.3 --> 2333.1600000000003
this particular project is a pure

2330.82 --> 2336.28
top-down view thing

2333.16 --> 2339.72
the one that I just showed that I made

2336.28 --> 2339.7200000000003
it's pure top down

2343.66 --> 2349.56
anyway yeah very cool LSG thank you for

2347.14 --> 2349.56
sharing that

2356.579 --> 2363.0600000000004
build a diorama what the hell what does

2360.4 --> 2363.06
that even mean

2373.359 --> 2376.02
all right

2391.079 --> 2397.8390000000004
yeah by the way as for the title goes

2395.38 --> 2399.94
it's not because I wanted to bring up my

2397.839 --> 2402.2799999999997
DND Maps but it was actually a reference

2399.94 --> 2405.76
to yesterday's Flat Earth debates

2402.28 --> 2409.079
which was really epic

2405.76 --> 2409.079
my 3D oh

2412.0 --> 2418.78
right well in order to actually do that

2415.119 --> 2423.099
I would have to make an honest height

2418.78 --> 2425.94
map for my world which I technically

2423.099 --> 2425.94
haven't done

2429.04 --> 2434.2
I mean there are high differences like

2431.619 --> 2437.02
when it matters mechanically for what is

2434.2 --> 2441.5789999999997
happening in the location

2437.02 --> 2445.74
but like actual exact Geographic height

2441.579 --> 2445.7400000000002
chart I have not made that really

2446.14 --> 2451.48
I just never did that

2449.44 --> 2453.579
this is

2451.48 --> 2455.819
and it's run into problems because of

2453.579 --> 2455.819
that

2458.619 --> 2463.78
I've actually ran into like not knowing

2462.46 --> 2467.38
anymore like

2463.78 --> 2469.8590000000004
where is this how high is this like I

2467.38 --> 2469.859
don't know

2470.5 --> 2474.24
is

2472.24 --> 2474.24
this

2474.3 --> 2481.1800000000003
simulation is destabilizing damn it

2477.4 --> 2483.6600000000003
input is conflicting it did happen a

2481.18 --> 2483.66
couple of times

2491.319 --> 2496.359
right but that's also because well I

2493.72 --> 2498.7
improvise a lot

2496.359 --> 2501.4
I try to improvise in a way that doesn't

2498.7 --> 2504.22
get in my own way

2501.4 --> 2506.079
doesn't always work

2504.22 --> 2508.48
sometimes you just have to go with

2506.079 --> 2510.1600000000003
whatever is there or everything goes

2508.48 --> 2512.44
wrong and then afterwards you'll find

2510.16 --> 2516.16
that oh [ __ ] that actually ruined an

2512.44 --> 2520.54
idea I had tried to set up oh

2516.16 --> 2522.64
yeah it happens a lot with the being a

2520.54 --> 2526.66
gay master in Dungeons and Dragons it

2522.64 --> 2526.66
happens a lot anyway

2531.94 --> 2533.94
um

2540.359 --> 2547.359
right but the uh the title

2544.359 --> 2548.44
is mostly based on yesterday's Flat

2547.359 --> 2551.319
Earth debate

2548.44 --> 2555.3
we had another ether

2551.319 --> 2555.3
chanter again an ethereum

2555.579 --> 2558.599
so I like to call them

2559.02 --> 2564.16
but it was like a four hour show it was

2562.42 --> 2567.48
very long

2564.16 --> 2567.48
very energetic

2570.819 --> 2574.54
Blue Eyes Green Cliff sleeping worse

2573.64 --> 2576.46
what

2574.54 --> 2577.839
no

2576.46 --> 2580.619
don't know what you're talking about

2577.839 --> 2580.619
truth matters

2596.38 --> 2601.56
but of course ether Compass is a joke

2602.56 --> 2607.48
because

2604.18 --> 2610.24
a compass is magnetic

2607.48 --> 2612.54
but then if you ask the ethereum for

2610.24 --> 2616.5989999999997
evidence they're gonna point you at

2612.54 --> 2620.619
electromagnetic things or magnetic field

2616.599 --> 2623.2000000000003
or field not a wave yes

2620.619 --> 2625.359
so I thought that The Ether Compass was

2623.2 --> 2628.98
kind of funny

2625.359 --> 2628.98
when you play on words with that

2629.44 --> 2635.079
and yeah we did talk about compasses

2632.26 --> 2637.1800000000003
also

2635.079 --> 2640.78
like

2637.18 --> 2643.06
I got it yeah I got a bit whilst by

2640.78 --> 2645.3390000000004
Nathan and all that but like

2643.06 --> 2648.94
there's this thing with compasses like

2645.339 --> 2652.2
basic passive compasses where like the

2648.94 --> 2652.2000000000003
needle goes down

2652.42 --> 2655.9
like has a tendency to go go towards the

2655.06 --> 2658.2999999999997
ground

2655.9 --> 2660.64
and I argued for that

2658.3 --> 2663.6400000000003
in a way that like yeah that makes sense

2660.64 --> 2666.22
because all the magnetic origin points

2663.64 --> 2667.96
are below the Horizon they're all part

2666.22 --> 2670.839
of the ground

2667.96 --> 2672.88
right magnetic field is not originating

2670.839 --> 2676.66
from some point in the middle of the air

2672.88 --> 2681.2400000000002
or a peak of a mountain or something

2676.66 --> 2681.24
no it's the ground

2681.819 --> 2688.48
so why wouldn't a magnetic

2685.78 --> 2691.119
yeah a compass point slightly downward

2688.48 --> 2693.52
and there's like a counterweight that

2691.119 --> 2696.46
they put on it typically but why would

2693.52 --> 2698.079
they even need to well because it might

2696.46 --> 2699.579
be pointing down now everybody got to

2698.079 --> 2702.2200000000003
like oh what are you talking about

2699.579 --> 2704.6800000000003
that's nonsense and then they got off

2702.22 --> 2706.24
into speculating how about how there

2704.68 --> 2708.3999999999996
supposedly were seven different

2706.24 --> 2710.5
compasses for the seven different

2708.4 --> 2713.1600000000003
magnetic regions and it got really

2710.5 --> 2713.16
nonsensical

2715.599 --> 2722.1600000000003
all right so that's where the ether

2717.579 --> 2722.1600000000003
Compass play on words come from

2723.339 --> 2726.339
iconography

2726.52 --> 2731.319
that's dream walk related

2731.5 --> 2736.0
I don't know what specifically that was

2733.96 --> 2739.859
about even it's just

2736.0 --> 2739.859
a very telling word

2744.7 --> 2747.1189999999997
anyway

2757.74 --> 2762.22
my argument

2760.18 --> 2764.5
didn't have anything to do with either

2762.22 --> 2766.839
it just had to do with why would a

2764.5 --> 2768.64
compass point downwards

2766.839 --> 2771.5789999999997
well because the magnetic fields

2768.64 --> 2774.64
originating from below your feet

2771.579 --> 2778.619
not literally that specific point but

2774.64 --> 2778.6189999999997
like from an orthographic View

2779.099 --> 2782.339
underneath you

2783.819 --> 2788.92
so it's always going to be somewhat

2786.4 --> 2791.5
angled down and at like the North Pole

2788.92 --> 2794.7400000000002
it should be going straight down

2791.5 --> 2796.66
that was my argument right that was all

2794.74 --> 2799.72
and then everybody said like oh that's a

2796.66 --> 2801.7599999999998
ball win thing to say uh no absolutely

2799.72 --> 2804.339
not

2801.76 --> 2807.78
but yeah I made that point and was kind

2804.339 --> 2807.7799999999997
of walched over but whatever

2810.66 --> 2814.92
recognize a reason or you don't

2815.5 --> 2817.5
um

2819.819 --> 2824.619
no but the whole ether [ __ ] is

2821.8 --> 2826.9
completely nonsensical

2824.619 --> 2830.2000000000003
it is always about that

2826.9 --> 2831.819
which is not manifested

2830.2 --> 2834.04
right that's the point

2831.819 --> 2837.22
so you could never prove it because

2834.04 --> 2839.38
you're basing your alleged evidence for

2837.22 --> 2842.0789999999997
something's existence on

2839.38 --> 2845.6800000000003
something not being there

2842.079 --> 2848.7000000000003
that that's what it's come down to

2845.68 --> 2848.7
it's like

2849.099 --> 2854.079
physics mysticism

2852.339 --> 2855.88
I think that's actually a really good

2854.079 --> 2858.54
description for it's like physics

2855.88 --> 2858.54
mysticism

2858.76 --> 2863.98
the mechanical approach of that which is

2862.359 --> 2866.98
not there

2863.98 --> 2872.68
yeah that's pretty damn mysticism based

2866.98 --> 2872.68
so yeah physics mysticism ethereon

2890.26 --> 2895.96
and before we know it

2892.359 --> 2898.619
they shall title themselves as etherean

2895.96 --> 2898.619
Mystics

2900.12 --> 2903.42
[Music]

2921.28 --> 2928.3
okay all right what a weird thing to say

2924.16 --> 2933.1189999999997
who's kids did them

2928.3 --> 2933.119
why are you assuming kids made them

2937.3 --> 2943.599
there were Maps

2940.359 --> 2947.04
and they were quite serious Maps

2943.599 --> 2947.04
of virtual places

2950.079 --> 2958.079
sorry if it isn't some cookie cutter

2953.44 --> 2958.079
like Rembrandt or whatever

2960.4 --> 2964.02
it's basically a design drawing

2971.579 --> 2974.7000000000003
cooked here

2982.72 --> 2986.52
damn it clouds come back

2991.839 --> 2994.839
what

2997.359 --> 3000.68
what are you talking about

3016.079 --> 3020.2400000000002
what okay flutter Sage

3023.339 --> 3027.5589999999997
I was just talking about that

3028.92 --> 3033.26
your daddy son oh oh okay

3059.4 --> 3065.54
there are Graphics designer by trade

3062.52 --> 3065.54
yeah thanks

3066.78 --> 3072.3590000000004
I mean it was never meant as a graphic

3069.48 --> 3076.52
it's just a

3072.359 --> 3076.52
a makeshift map pretty much

3080.04 --> 3086.9
I mean you wouldn't believe how many

3082.579 --> 3086.9
alterations have taken place even

3105.359 --> 3110.0589999999997
right but it does make sense if you're a

3107.339 --> 3110.0589999999997
graphic designer

3154.319 --> 3160.68
uh

3157.2 --> 3163.46
we should just

3160.68 --> 3163.46
already

3195.92 --> 3198.92
thank you

3213.359 --> 3215.54
foreign

3226.74 --> 3234.68
what's the difference

3228.72 --> 3234.68
between ether and spirit to an ethereum

3235.68 --> 3242.54
well they reified into one thing that's

3239.339 --> 3242.54
what they do with it all

3242.7 --> 3247.0989999999997
right so I like to compare the whole

3245.52 --> 3250.559
thing to

3247.099 --> 3253.02
what certain supposed scientists and

3250.559 --> 3257.579
physicists tended to do

3253.02 --> 3260.28
by saying for example oh material and

3257.579 --> 3263.76
light and electricity it's like all one

3260.28 --> 3265.619
Spectrum it's One Singular thing and one

3263.76 --> 3266.6400000000003
thing is just the other thing in another

3265.619 --> 3267.839
form

3266.64 --> 3271.68
right

3267.839 --> 3273.839
that's what this ether is to do that to

3271.68 --> 3277.2599999999998
unify everything so yeah it makes

3273.839 --> 3281.04
absolute perfect sense that

3277.26 --> 3283.559
they would think that the spirit that is

3281.04 --> 3285.839
like our energy and all that our

3283.559 --> 3289.92
personal energy available

3285.839 --> 3293.7599999999998
that is directed by our by our mind and

3289.92 --> 3296.579
our Consciousness that that is the same

3293.76 --> 3298.2000000000003
thing as what causes light to be a wave

3296.579 --> 3300.42
mistakenly and

3298.2 --> 3303.4199999999996
and magnetism

3300.42 --> 3306.059
so they just reify they just squish it

3303.42 --> 3308.2200000000003
all into One Singular thing

3306.059 --> 3310.46
that's their Universal tendency to do

3308.22 --> 3310.4599999999996
that

3328.02 --> 3333.18
right and the Capstone is ultimately

3330.96 --> 3337.7400000000002
mystical

3333.18 --> 3339.839
as it is that which has not manifested

3337.74 --> 3342.4799999999996
yet

3339.839 --> 3344.72
but is expected to still be there this

3342.48 --> 3344.72
fight

3345.96 --> 3349.319
right

3347.16 --> 3351.72
and hey philosophically there might be

3349.319 --> 3356.839
something to that it's just that

3351.72 --> 3356.839
mechanically and scientifically it isn't

3357.059 --> 3360.98
and there's no Direct

3361.079 --> 3366.6600000000003
logic to even assume that unmanifested

3365.579 --> 3369.619
things

3366.66 --> 3369.6189999999997
are things

3374.819 --> 3379.04
it is a form of magical thinking

3406.4 --> 3411.599
right so I hope you guys think what I'm

3409.74 --> 3413.22
talking about is interesting and can

3411.599 --> 3416.299
follow it

3413.22 --> 3416.299
still overheated

3435.66 --> 3440.1189999999997
okay a man like me I didn't know that

3440.52 --> 3446.359
I haven't really kept track of Alex Dean

3442.92 --> 3446.359
I have no idea what he's up to

3450.599 --> 3454.6400000000003
but I'm sure he's been very active

3500.819 --> 3503.819
foreign

3533.28 --> 3537.38
finally the thresholds

3537.42 --> 3541.46
the threshold of the Sun

3542.7 --> 3545.8999999999996
it is finally

3546.0 --> 3553.04
stop hitting my wall

3548.52 --> 3553.04
sounds finally stop hearing my wall

3554.16 --> 3557.7799999999997
now things can't be cool

3567.72 --> 3571.8799999999997
oh yeah by the way that was weird

3572.94 --> 3576.5
no I'm not going to mention it

3577.079 --> 3582.92
so I don't know where

3579.54 --> 3582.92
political [ __ ]

3589.26 --> 3593.2200000000003
but I have catching been catching up a

3591.42 --> 3594.78
bit with like RT

3593.22 --> 3596.339
actually I haven't really watched for a

3594.78 --> 3599.299
while but I can still reach it through

3596.339 --> 3599.299
Upper browser

3634.799 --> 3638.66
okay a man like me

3640.52 --> 3646.88
yeah he he's really turning into an

3644.46 --> 3646.88
alpha

3656.16 --> 3659.0
hilarious

3673.26 --> 3677.76
yeah PGC net yeah it is ridiculous I

3675.72 --> 3680.7
mean Arty is like

3677.76 --> 3683.2200000000003
it's not perfect

3680.7 --> 3686.339
but yeah they are

3683.22 --> 3688.14
one of the cleanest levels of news that

3686.339 --> 3690.72
I've seen out there

3688.14 --> 3694.14
I mean they're on average cleaner than

3690.72 --> 3696.859
even alternative sources

3694.14 --> 3696.859
it just

3697.5 --> 3702.599
so much calmer and more

3701.04 --> 3704.4
just

3702.599 --> 3706.079
careful

3704.4 --> 3710.119
with their trains of thinking and all

3706.079 --> 3710.119
that it's just yeah I do appreciate it

3710.94 --> 3716.099
when everything else is just going

3713.94 --> 3719.46
hysterical everywhere

3716.099 --> 3721.8590000000004
it is really good to have just a

3719.46 --> 3726.119
a new source

3721.859 --> 3729.72
that just doesn't really do it like that

3726.119 --> 3732.839
that tries to sort of staying stay what

3729.72 --> 3735.0789999999997
we used to know as let's work down to

3732.839 --> 3735.0789999999997
earth

3749.22 --> 3753.48
no flare it's banned here too and then

3751.319 --> 3755.16
it's been everywhere it's banned all

3753.48 --> 3758.16
throughout Europe

3755.16 --> 3760.44
America and probably

3758.16 --> 3762.98
Asian countries as well

3760.44 --> 3762.98
certain

3766.14 --> 3769.339
I don't know for sure

3778.619 --> 3784.4
looks like Mark sartin's prediction was

3780.839 --> 3784.4
right which one what

3791.94 --> 3796.099
did he predict that

3793.619 --> 3796.099
huh

3803.46 --> 3807.44
well I thought that something like that

3805.44 --> 3810.059
was gonna happen once

3807.44 --> 3812.039
[ __ ] broke out in with the Ukraine

3810.059 --> 3814.7400000000002
craziness propaganda

3812.039 --> 3818.48
then at that point I knew that RT was

3814.74 --> 3818.4799999999996
just not gonna get through that

3818.64 --> 3822.96
but I'm not even sure if I really was so

3821.039 --> 3826.7000000000003
outspoken about that as to make a

3822.96 --> 3826.7
prediction I don't even remember

3826.799 --> 3828.98
foreign

3858.0 --> 3860.119
thank you

3864.02 --> 3868.619
he did huh

3866.46 --> 3871.619
okay flighter Sage well he must have had

3868.619 --> 3874.02
a more direct clue than

3871.619 --> 3876.6600000000003
somebody from the inside might have like

3874.02 --> 3879.559
gave him a heads up

3876.66 --> 3879.5589999999997
more directly

3903.92 --> 3909.48
well Nathan is gonna have a live show I

3906.78 --> 3912.38
just threw out the link

3909.48 --> 3912.38
that's something

3946.02 --> 3948.2
foreign

3997.44 --> 4003.819
right so again sorry guys

4000.44 --> 4003.819
it's really hot here

4005.359 --> 4010.4
I've had really good dinner again

4007.76 --> 4012.7990000000004
yesterday same meal I basically went

4010.4 --> 4015.559
through the whole thing in two days

4012.799 --> 4018.559
my body really needed it

4015.559 --> 4021.2200000000003
do feel like a lot better now

4018.559 --> 4021.2200000000003
uh

4024.68 --> 4028.8799999999997
oh also

4027.079 --> 4032.0
I found out something about something

4028.88 --> 4034.46
that I eat apparently these broccoli

4032.0 --> 4037.88
sticks that I call them

4034.46 --> 4041.42
which are called BBs they're actually

4037.88 --> 4042.7400000000002
not just broccoli they're a crossover I

4041.42 --> 4045.7400000000002
didn't even know that they're hybrid

4042.74 --> 4047.299
they're a hybrid between broccoli and

4045.74 --> 4049.4599999999996
asparagus

4047.299 --> 4051.74
like green asparagus

4049.46 --> 4053.66
what

4051.74 --> 4056.6189999999997
what

4053.66 --> 4056.6189999999997
I like it

4057.319 --> 4064.18
and it is it yeah it is a natural hybrid

4060.22 --> 4064.18
Apparently that is possible

4065.9 --> 4069.94
I mean weird but delicious

4080.9 --> 4086.299
yeah but that's why I call them broccoli

4083.42 --> 4089.0
sticks because Normal broccoli is more

4086.299 --> 4090.98
like a cabbage and it just is like a big

4089.0 --> 4093.319
flower that

4090.98 --> 4094.339
that might have a big stick at the

4093.319 --> 4097.339
bottom

4094.339 --> 4099.5599999999995
oh these just are like the thin version

4097.339 --> 4100.699
it's more like a broccoli little mini

4099.56 --> 4104.179
tree

4100.699 --> 4106.879999999999
like a stick and just with branches and

4104.179 --> 4110.319
it looks exactly like broccoli except in

4106.88 --> 4110.319
that format great

4111.98 --> 4117.218999999999
you like as far as more than broccoli

4114.62 --> 4117.219
okay

4119.12 --> 4123.62
anyway I've been eating them for what is

4121.819 --> 4127.88
it now

4123.62 --> 4127.88
two three years great

4128.42 --> 4133.339
but anytime I say like oh for example

4131.06 --> 4135.159000000001
chicken broccoli it's actually those

4133.339 --> 4137.839
things

4135.159 --> 4138.739
I just thought it's like oh it's some

4137.839 --> 4141.44
weird

4138.739 --> 4143.718999999999
version of broccoli

4141.44 --> 4146.259
but it's actually a crossover I didn't

4143.719 --> 4146.259
even know that

4146.839 --> 4149.799
worked great

4151.339 --> 4157.54
yeah and by the way I'm not too big a

4153.62 --> 4157.54
fan on actual asparagus

4162.44 --> 4169.419999999999
that's why I was surprised to hear that

4165.319 --> 4169.42
they are across species

4182.48 --> 4185.48
foreign

4213.08 --> 4216.04
foreign

4239.8 --> 4247.06
like me what the hell

4243.38 --> 4247.06
that's super gross

4253.88 --> 4260.9800000000005
are you saying you got that in the

4255.92 --> 4260.9800000000005
YouTube ad because that is messed up

4267.26 --> 4271.1
I think I may have seen that had one

4269.78 --> 4274.82
time as well

4271.1 --> 4277.120000000001
and I was utterly shocked then like what

4274.82 --> 4277.12
the hell

4294.8 --> 4300.219
yeah YouTube's doing some really weird

4297.86 --> 4300.219
things

4305.3 --> 4310.6990000000005
I mean they're gonna get like serious

4308.179 --> 4313.179
complaints about this like very serious

4310.699 --> 4313.178999999999
complaints

4319.159 --> 4323.179
if they're going to keep throwing that

4320.96 --> 4325.36
kind of garbage out right you know they

4323.179 --> 4325.36
are

4348.89 --> 4354.58
[Music]

4351.56 --> 4354.580000000001
what was that

4354.62 --> 4359.42
oh

4357.08 --> 4362.199
wait was that some kind of sound

4359.42 --> 4362.1990000000005
notification

4365.48 --> 4372.259999999999
oh wait no it's yeah it's something else

4369.58 --> 4373.94
because right when you said that I heard

4372.26 --> 4379.4800000000005
like plunk

4373.94 --> 4379.48
what just that just accidentally timing

4381.38 --> 4385.84
anyway thanks letter Sage I will check

4383.54 --> 4385.84
it out

4399.14 --> 4403.9400000000005
yeah

4400.64 --> 4406.780000000001
thank you thank you flutter Sage

4403.94 --> 4406.78
appreciate it

4423.38 --> 4427.58
now you heard that too right yeah but it

4425.84 --> 4431.06
was actually me

4427.58 --> 4434.84
uh getting Auto basically getting kicked

4431.06 --> 4437.179
out of the waiting Row for Google meet

4434.84 --> 4440.02
because I opened it up early for

4437.179 --> 4440.02
Nathan's show

4441.02 --> 4445.46
but yeah if you just keep yourself in a

4443.6 --> 4447.26
waiting row eventually apparently click

4445.46 --> 4450.28
kicks you out and then makes that sound

4447.26 --> 4450.280000000001
I didn't know that

4457.1 --> 4460.1
oh

4484.96 --> 4492.14
right so anyway if you guys would

4488.659 --> 4494.78
like me to discuss anything else

4492.14 --> 4497.06
get into something specific

4494.78 --> 4500.42
because it's not gonna automatically

4497.06 --> 4503.5
just pop out I'm just here cooking

4500.42 --> 4503.5
kind of waiting

4504.98 --> 4512.9
to like be able to just get going again

4509.42 --> 4515.3
but if you throw something at me

4512.9 --> 4517.759999999999
then that helps a lot you might get the

4515.3 --> 4522.04
win the wheel spinning easily

4517.76 --> 4522.04
without me getting myself overheated

4525.02 --> 4530.14
why did chat today guessing everyone is

4526.88 --> 4530.14
too hot probably

4530.659 --> 4534.159
it's just one of those days

4535.76 --> 4541.34
that's great though I mean it's nice to

4539.239 --> 4544.48
just have a day where you kind of like

4541.34 --> 4544.4800000000005
naturally chill out

4544.58 --> 4548.78
what yeah if you want to get all active

4546.739 --> 4551.799999999999
and creative yeah then it gets a little

4548.78 --> 4551.8
slow down

4553.04 --> 4557.3
and really it does because in the

4555.14 --> 4558.9800000000005
evening like yesterday as well it was

4557.3 --> 4561.62
pretty hot

4558.98 --> 4564.98
but then in the evening once the sun

4561.62 --> 4567.0199999999995
really like goes down I get it's like a

4564.98 --> 4570.199
balloon suddenly gets Unleashed it's

4567.02 --> 4571.580000000001
like oh yes oh I can concentrate ah and

4570.199 --> 4573.62
then everything starts to fall into

4571.58 --> 4575.12
place where it was just too slow down

4573.62 --> 4577.4
during the day

4575.12 --> 4579.98
it's like I certainly realized

4577.4 --> 4584.62
everything that happened it's like that

4579.98 --> 4584.62
and then I use it in well dreamwalking

4585.199 --> 4589.599999999999
a nice day here in the Shire

4595.88 --> 4599.6
yes LSG

4600.44 --> 4604.299999999999
keep it hidden keep it safe

4614.84 --> 4619.28
the New Hampshire okay

4619.64 --> 4622.64
foreign

4672.38 --> 4675.8
all right so if you're looking at me

4674.06 --> 4677.719
right now you think oh wow that guy

4675.8 --> 4681.26
looks overheated

4677.719 --> 4682.699
then realize that basically two hours

4681.26 --> 4685.64
ago

4682.699 --> 4688.299999999999
it was warmer than it's now

4685.64 --> 4688.3
in here

4701.3 --> 4707.6
oh all right yeah at least G yeah

4706.04 --> 4710.0
nice

4707.6 --> 4712.719
is already discharged from the rehab

4710.0 --> 4712.719
that's awesome

4716.12 --> 4722.239
yeah take care and uh

4719.239 --> 4726.459999999999
keep it Sharp

4722.239 --> 4726.459999999999
I'll see you probably tomorrow

4752.239 --> 4755.32
what the [ __ ]

4756.199 --> 4761.0
we will send you a super chat if I put

4759.02 --> 4765.080000000001
on that heater

4761.0 --> 4767.42
and close screw you dude this is

4765.08 --> 4769.9
I don't want to turn my room into a

4767.42 --> 4769.9
sauna

4770.0 --> 4773.62
that sounds really messed up

4776.12 --> 4780.8
I mean it's gonna take more than one

4778.46 --> 4784.9
dollar Super Chat each

4780.8 --> 4784.900000000001
before I go that silly

4785.0 --> 4789.56
I mean I would probably survive it I

4787.52 --> 4792.76
mean you didn't specify any specific

4789.56 --> 4792.76
duration so

4793.04 --> 4797.199
um

4794.02 --> 4797.1990000000005
but no

4801.02 --> 4805.6990000000005
yeah but yeah this night it was so

4804.26 --> 4806.900000000001
freaking hot

4805.699 --> 4809.419999999999
like

4806.9 --> 4811.28
that that's why behind me I'm better if

4809.42 --> 4812.9
you picked up on that it's like it's

4811.28 --> 4814.4
just sheets

4812.9 --> 4817.82
like

4814.4 --> 4821.179
and I could barely even have that cover

4817.82 --> 4824.299999999999
me without breaking out sweating like as

4821.179 --> 4826.88
I'm sleeping super annoying it was like

4824.3 --> 4829.28
really hot this this night

4826.88 --> 4831.7390000000005
and I went to bed pretty decently early

4829.28 --> 4833.84
but just still like ah

4831.739 --> 4836.9
kept waking up all throughout the night

4833.84 --> 4838.639
because it's like ah

4836.9 --> 4841.159
I'm like

4838.639 --> 4843.139
lying in a puddle it's just every time

4841.159 --> 4845.62
waking up in a puddle that's what it

4843.139 --> 4845.62
felt like

4846.5 --> 4853.219
sorry sorry for that imagery it's just

4850.52 --> 4855.860000000001
been really hot this night

4853.219 --> 4858.44
not so much like every other night I

4855.86 --> 4860.179
mean three days ago I would even just

4858.44 --> 4863.0
have that

4860.179 --> 4866.139
more than just bed sheets but yesterday

4863.0 --> 4866.139
night was just

4876.5 --> 4880.0
last night this night

4883.94 --> 4890.9
this night tonight last night is yeah

4887.78 --> 4894.759999999999
last night that's the last night that

4890.9 --> 4894.759999999999
has passed so that would be

4895.639 --> 4902.32
roughly 15 hours ago

4899.239 --> 4902.32
that's last night

4908.3 --> 4913.820000000001
I hate when it's hot at night right I

4911.06 --> 4916.820000000001
look it's it can be doable if you have

4913.82 --> 4919.34
like a decent fan

4916.82 --> 4922.88
that you can basically

4919.34 --> 4924.62
like install next to your bed and by the

4922.88 --> 4926.36
way don't aim in at your face because

4924.62 --> 4928.159
you're going to completely dry out if

4926.36 --> 4930.139
you do that just aim it like at your

4928.159 --> 4931.82
feet

4930.139 --> 4934.6990000000005
or like

4931.82 --> 4935.84
from your feet upward to your body

4934.699 --> 4939.259999999999
that's

4935.84 --> 4941.659000000001
the best way to keep cool at night when

4939.26 --> 4943.280000000001
it's super hot without completely drying

4941.659 --> 4945.259999999999
out because if you aim it directly at

4943.28 --> 4948.0199999999995
your face it's like

4945.26 --> 4950.06
like all the moist on your mouth it's

4948.02 --> 4953.4400000000005
just gonna keep evaporating evaporating

4950.06 --> 4956.84
and then suddenly it's like

4953.44 --> 4958.5199999999995
you don't want to wake up that way or

4956.84 --> 4959.78
not wake up

4958.52 --> 4962.38
what

4959.78 --> 4962.38
yeah

4962.659 --> 4968.48
but yeah I don't really have a fat like

4965.42 --> 4972.56
this is the only fan I have and it's

4968.48 --> 4974.178999999999
has a one meter cord and a USB stick

4972.56 --> 4976.52
so

4974.179 --> 4978.56
but I don't really want one anyway I

4976.52 --> 4981.159000000001
mean it it's like I just gotta learn and

4978.56 --> 4981.159000000001
live with this

4986.679 --> 4992.78
didn't somebody give you money about two

4989.54 --> 4995.38
weeks ago and buy both a fan no

4992.78 --> 4995.38
what

4996.139 --> 4999.04
did they

5007.96 --> 5013.6
buy support from the USB isn't going to

5010.54 --> 5016.06
be very powerful but look up close range

5013.6 --> 5021.76
like

5016.06 --> 5024.76
a half a half a meter it's great like in

5021.76 --> 5027.719
less than half a meter distance Works

5024.76 --> 5027.719
absolutely great

5027.76 --> 5033.159000000001
right and you just want a just a few

5031.179 --> 5035.26
moments of cooling anyway right I don't

5033.159 --> 5037.5
want to have this thing constantly turn

5035.26 --> 5037.5
on

5043.42 --> 5046.54
must be pretty efficient yeah that's

5045.04 --> 5048.5199999999995
what I thought I thought it's like this

5046.54 --> 5052.6
is a genius thing

5048.52 --> 5054.52
it's super cheap it's like cheap it

5052.6 --> 5056.860000000001
looks cheap ass

5054.52 --> 5058.360000000001
it's probably like five euros or

5056.86 --> 5061.239
something but I think it's a freaking

5058.36 --> 5062.739
piece of Genius equipment

5061.239 --> 5065.259999999999
I mean

5062.739 --> 5065.57
this thing is not gonna break anytime

5065.26 --> 5066.820000000001
soon

5065.57 --> 5069.699
[Music]

5066.82 --> 5074.139
it seems to not give any problems as I'm

5069.699 --> 5075.94
using it just in USB port of my computer

5074.139 --> 5078.46
I mean this thing's giving me less

5075.94 --> 5081.599999999999
problems than both my mic

5078.46 --> 5081.6
and my webcam

5082.84 --> 5086.38
it always works

5084.76 --> 5088.12
so

5086.38 --> 5091.42
and I got it for free from an old

5088.12 --> 5095.099999999999
roommate that just left it

5091.42 --> 5095.1
I'm I really like it

5113.8 --> 5120.12
oh almost forgot oh very late to the

5117.58 --> 5120.12
game with this

5122.86 --> 5128.08
yeah I before I was all watching Owen

5126.34 --> 5130.84
Benjamin yesterday

5128.08 --> 5134.92
from yesterday before the show I was

5130.84 --> 5137.58
watching it I was watching another video

5134.92 --> 5137.58
Rome

5141.46 --> 5145.44
great why can't you just

5156.52 --> 5160.02
from mind unveiled

5160.239 --> 5166.48
like if you like high tier thinking

5163.54 --> 5169.36
structural thinking

5166.48 --> 5171.58
right and you're curious this is

5169.36 --> 5176.0199999999995
something you kind of need to look into

5171.58 --> 5178.179
like you need it to understand it

5176.02 --> 5180.400000000001
really fascinating

5178.179 --> 5183.9400000000005
but like might not failed had a video

5180.4 --> 5187.138999999999
created images from mind dream machine

5183.94 --> 5190.659
ancient Tech has nothing to really

5187.139 --> 5195.52
but it's about using certain program

5190.659 --> 5198.699
like Imaging programs that are based on

5195.52 --> 5200.400000000001
like artificial learning

5198.699 --> 5202.9
and it's

5200.4 --> 5205.839999999999
mind-blowing but you got to be careful

5202.9 --> 5208.96
with it even like calls it like this is

5205.84 --> 5210.88
like a cult imagery but what does that

5208.96 --> 5212.199
mean you see because it isn't hidden

5210.88 --> 5214.84
it's right there

5212.199 --> 5217.54
now but it's all derived from the mind

5214.84 --> 5220.38
it's like interpretation based from

5217.54 --> 5220.38
database

5220.659 --> 5225.82
of what just comes out of the Mind

5224.02 --> 5227.820000000001
through machine learning put together

5225.82 --> 5231.159
and then

5227.82 --> 5233.679
guest as to exactly what you envision

5231.159 --> 5235.9
and it is creepy what it can do because

5233.679 --> 5238.139
it can also just completely mimic

5235.9 --> 5240.82
photographs that are almost

5238.139 --> 5245.219
indistinguishable from the real thing

5240.82 --> 5248.0199999999995
that gave me a really big red flag

5245.219 --> 5251.56
concerning certain things I have seen

5248.02 --> 5254.080000000001
over at Martin Luther's presentations

5251.56 --> 5256.900000000001
wonder if Martin Luther actually even

5254.08 --> 5260.26
knows that he might

5256.9 --> 5262.42
so that's when you should really watch I

5260.26 --> 5266.1
left a comment in there too but I'm

5262.42 --> 5266.1
gonna link it up because it is

5266.679 --> 5272.139
important

5269.62 --> 5274.3
to understand it

5272.139 --> 5277.0
don't necessarily watch through the

5274.3 --> 5279.400000000001
whole slideshow which is like I think at

5277.0 --> 5281.199
least half of it or two-thirds

5279.4 --> 5282.879999999999
watch some of it

5281.199 --> 5285.94
but

5282.88 --> 5289.179
all the parts where he actually talks

5285.94 --> 5290.5599999999995
outside of the the slideshow of these

5289.179 --> 5293.02
imagery

5290.56 --> 5295.360000000001
it's important to listen to it all he

5293.02 --> 5297.639
says very sensible things

5295.36 --> 5300.159
and also I didn't know

5297.639 --> 5302.62
he was kind of a programmer type I

5300.159 --> 5304.9
didn't know that now I understand it

5302.62 --> 5308.0199999999995
even like explains certain subtle

5304.9 --> 5311.08
details about how his voice is it's so

5308.02 --> 5313.42
interesting to me to basically find out

5311.08 --> 5316.0
he has

5313.42 --> 5319.0
a bit of programmer in him because that

5316.0 --> 5320.8
puts things into place as to how he

5319.0 --> 5323.26
composes himself

5320.8 --> 5325.360000000001
and I've been like staring at from a

5323.26 --> 5328.06
distance like why does he sound like

5325.36 --> 5329.259999999999
that now I get it now I get why he

5328.06 --> 5331.54
sounds like that

5329.26 --> 5336.280000000001
anyway

5331.54 --> 5338.699
very important video for understanding

5336.28 --> 5338.699
things

5340.96 --> 5346.6
make sure you watch it at some point

5343.48 --> 5349.299999999999
especially LSG I'd recommend it

5346.6 --> 5353.1
you probably already watched it but he

5349.3 --> 5353.1
just left by the way but uh

5353.199 --> 5356.879999999999
I'll just send it to him

5374.199 --> 5378.96
got it open on another tab excellent

5379.36 --> 5384.759999999999
right

5381.1 --> 5387.400000000001
but yeah don't gush too much over what

5384.76 --> 5389.320000000001
you're gonna see it is remarkable it is

5387.4 --> 5391.839999999999
Fantastical but there's something very

5389.32 --> 5394.78
eerie about it

5391.84 --> 5397.9800000000005
and then eeriness

5394.78 --> 5403.659
if you scroll to the comment section

5397.98 --> 5407.218999999999
is quite raw rawly explained by myself

5403.659 --> 5407.219
in the comment that I left

5407.86 --> 5412.719
right

5409.32 --> 5415.0599999999995
implications that you can intuitively

5412.719 --> 5417.159
sense but you might not realize what

5415.06 --> 5418.2390000000005
that sense even is what it is telling

5417.159 --> 5420.78
you

5418.239 --> 5420.78
right

5424.3 --> 5431.46
Mr cheswick's latest video

5427.179 --> 5431.46
which one it has a lot of little videos

5435.34 --> 5440.28
NASA brings uh bring out the [ __ ]

5445.12 --> 5447.78
over there

5460.139 --> 5466.84
right anyway guys

5463.78 --> 5469.78
the show's passed

5466.84 --> 5471.9400000000005
sorry for being just a

5469.78 --> 5473.739
sitting here a lot and just being

5471.94 --> 5475.0
overheated instead of continually

5473.739 --> 5477.159
talking

5475.0 --> 5479.44
it's just so hot I really hope tomorrow

5477.159 --> 5482.5599999999995
will be a little better the weather

5479.44 --> 5483.219
forecast says it will

yeah to the show title

5496.78 --> 5501.659
as much as it deserves because I I do

5499.179 --> 5505.659
think this show title like does

5501.659 --> 5508.48
encompass pun intended quite

5505.659 --> 5512.0199999999995
