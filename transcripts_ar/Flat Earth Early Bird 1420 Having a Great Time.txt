bit

117.479 --> 122.399
not sure yeah it doesn't really seem to

120.06 --> 124.74000000000001
be like Chemtrails or anything

122.399 --> 128.22
planes that I do see don't really leave

124.74 --> 131.099
a lot although yes some of them do

128.22 --> 133.379
but it's not really covering things up

131.099 --> 135.599
and that's good because I'm really

133.379 --> 138.48
liking the Sun

135.599 --> 142.01999999999998
also there is just like no wind and just

138.48 --> 145.81
that bright sun it's delightful

201.599 --> 206.879
stare on benches staring in the Sun and

204.3 --> 208.68
all that recharging so yeah it's great

[Music]

231.239 --> 235.22
right anyway how are you guys doing

235.62 --> 241.919

238.27 --> 241.919
[Music]

243.239 --> 247.68
15 degrees Celsius okay

246.06 --> 251.9
yeah

247.68 --> 251.9
it feels warmer than that but

253.2 --> 259.079
that's just the sun mostly oh it says

256.32 --> 263.639
that Monday it's going to be a fully

259.079 --> 266.24
sunny day but only 10 degrees okay

263.639 --> 266.24
weird

266.34 --> 271.32

268.74 --> 274.22
hey here we go again

271.32 --> 277.419
good to see you again

274.22 --> 277.41900000000004
[Music]

281.15 --> 284.19
[Music]

286.38 --> 291.15999999999997
right so yeah yesterday's Flat Earth

288.78 --> 294.32899999999995
debate was good

291.16 --> 294.329
[Music]

295.5 --> 300.919
I

297.419 --> 300.919
look around for quite a long time

303.18 --> 309.38
and yeah can't wait to hear that one

305.16 --> 309.38000000000005
back I mean some good shows

310.08 --> 312.5
right

314.22 --> 321.24
also of course flat swords hang out

318.06 --> 323.88
with Adam meekin and Brian

321.24 --> 326.52
got very technical though and at that

323.88 --> 329.78
hour of the day like I my my attention

326.52 --> 333.539
is not great for that sort of thing

329.78 --> 336.35999999999996
but it was a good hangout and and I

333.539 --> 339.539
really think that flat side is just

336.36 --> 341.82
it's just really coming together with

339.539 --> 343.979
what he's doing on his show and he's

341.82 --> 348.86
enjoying it too

343.979 --> 348.86
it seems much less stressed out by it

351.96 --> 354.13899999999995
foreign

361.68 --> 368.66
so yeah it's always enjoyable

363.9 --> 368.65999999999997
uh let's see what else

373.5 --> 380.039
oh yeah Dell also before that

377.16 --> 383.16
that was funny I mentioned that RV said

380.039 --> 385.31899999999996
that he was actually a Freemason and he

383.16 --> 388.02000000000004
he apparently took note of me saying

385.319 --> 390.259
that in the chat so he's Bell's watching

388.02 --> 392.039
flat side

390.259 --> 396.02000000000004
so

392.039 --> 396.02
that's just fun funny

401.16 --> 404.47900000000004
tune last night

407.039 --> 410.59999999999997
to me is respectful

410.759 --> 414.47900000000004
yeah

412.38 --> 417.12
oh bad

414.479 --> 419.039
God so this Bryant character is really

417.12 --> 421.5
like

419.039 --> 424.38
he's not just somebody that wants the

421.5 --> 426.36
bra he wants to be like a new figure on

424.38 --> 429.0
the scene

426.36 --> 432.78000000000003
is is that what he is because I don't

429.0 --> 434.79
know like I don't really watch enough to

432.78 --> 436.19899999999996
to get into it so

434.79 --> 439.199
[Music]

436.199 --> 442.08000000000004
it is Bryant now gonna be a reoccurring

439.199 --> 443.94
figure that supposedly like anti-flat

442.08 --> 445.31899999999996
Earth or nobility or something I don't

443.94 --> 448.52
know

445.319 --> 448.52000000000004
this is ridiculous

460.699 --> 465.68
oh I miss you hello fiber roads

470.28 --> 475.73999999999995
yeah fiber road's been painting he sent

473.58 --> 479.21999999999997
me some new

475.74 --> 482.039
shots projects

479.22 --> 484.139
yeah that was really fun having the

482.039 --> 486.8
uh

484.139 --> 486.8
Susanna

487.979 --> 493.34
pop in newly and share like some of her

490.62 --> 495.36
paintings like this is just like yay

493.34 --> 499.69899999999996
that's cool

495.36 --> 499.699
I like having artist types around

502.86 --> 506.87
anyway

503.65 --> 506.87
[Music]

508.259 --> 513.719
Brian talks like dumb sheep

511.919 --> 516.06
you don't know man maybe he's like some

513.719 --> 518.399
sort of special project to try to make

516.06 --> 520.5
lovers feel smart again and

518.399 --> 523.26
it's just like

520.5 --> 523.94
wherever he goes I don't know man this

523.26 --> 527.22
is

523.94 --> 529.86
ridiculously highly speculative and very

527.22 --> 532.019
likely not true as as I'm laying it down

529.86 --> 535.98
right now but

532.019 --> 537.36
maybe he's like this weird figure that's

535.98 --> 540.66
gonna like

537.36 --> 543.12
just throw money around and basically

540.66 --> 545.459
buy off all his opponents and if they're

543.12 --> 547.98
not willing to do that then he just will

545.459 --> 551.899
not even recognize they exist because

547.98 --> 551.899
that does exist that's a thing

552.12 --> 557.279
it's like also a thing in Media

554.82 --> 560.88
I mean that's not something new or

557.279 --> 565.019
anything so maybe it's like one of that

560.88 --> 568.98
like basically a new face of a project

565.019 --> 571.5600000000001
like yeah oh no see as a glober we're

568.98 --> 573.6
still smarter because that is really a

571.56 --> 576.54
thing I mean

573.6 --> 578.519
it's like one of the missions of the

576.54 --> 581.6999999999999
herders

578.519 --> 583.8
of Ballers is how do we keep them

581.7 --> 586.38
ignorant while make them feeling

583.8 --> 587.9399999999999
Superior to those that aren't and that

586.38 --> 591.18
is like

587.94 --> 594.0
a guardian not impossible

591.18 --> 595.92
thing basically but on a contemporary

594.0 --> 598.44
level it can't it's just like keep the

595.92 --> 600.18
juggling going in a very specific Rhythm

598.44 --> 601.2600000000001
and then everybody just gets hypnotized

600.18 --> 603.42
and then they

601.26 --> 606.48
they just don't see

603.42 --> 609.54
the information anymore

606.48 --> 610.8000000000001
right so it's like a double act very

609.54 --> 613.38
weird

610.8 --> 615.779
it does feel like that the guy the way

613.38 --> 618.18
he talks the way he composes himself the

615.779 --> 620.42
energy he does feel like he could be

618.18 --> 620.42
them

623.14 --> 633.1999999999999
[Music]

629.519 --> 633.2
cat just going back and forth

634.08 --> 640.2
this is really like this type of weather

636.839 --> 642.7790000000001
for a certain type of cats is like

640.2 --> 646.6800000000001
their curiosity comes out and they just

642.779 --> 649.74
like start to explore their territory

646.68 --> 651.4799999999999
why why would a cat do that well also

649.74 --> 653.76
because there's so much bright light and

651.48 --> 656.339
you just see more detail

653.76 --> 658.26
right well in the night

656.339 --> 660.4200000000001
they see movement

658.26 --> 662.959
which is good for hunting but not

660.42 --> 667.019
necessarily for

662.959 --> 669.1199999999999
imprinting the Dynamics the layout of

667.019 --> 671.88
your territory

669.12 --> 673.5600000000001
anyways

671.88 --> 675.74
these are the types of things I think

673.56 --> 675.7399999999999
about

682.26 --> 687.8
hey Terror 306 good to see you

685.079 --> 687.8
by the way

691.16 --> 696.38
okay here we go again that's gross

697.14 --> 699.74
dude

704.42 --> 708.75
okay here we go again don't make me ask

707.64 --> 710.899
how you know

708.75 --> 713.339
[Music]

710.899 --> 714.81
that size

713.339 --> 717.95
anyway uh

714.81 --> 717.9499999999999
[Music]

721.38 --> 724.5
[Music]

735.899 --> 742.8
right but anyway look

738.899 --> 745.32
this idea that I have this like this no

742.8 --> 748.019
like a new tier of anti-flat earther

745.32 --> 750.48
it's it basically just means more money

748.019 --> 752.4590000000001
is going to be thrown at it

750.48 --> 755.48
it's going to be Faker the guy is going

752.459 --> 755.4799999999999
to be more miserable

758.7 --> 765.38
well anybody that's gonna buy into it is

761.339 --> 765.3800000000001
just gonna become even more [ __ ]

765.66 --> 769.279
it's like what it is always

775.8 --> 778.579
no

780.36 --> 786.12
well maybe I can't say I'm not a woman

783.72 --> 788.76
so I may maybe women do have like a

786.12 --> 791.779
penis size instinct or whatever

788.76 --> 791.779
I don't know

792.66 --> 799.3389999999999
but I was talking rather about your own

795.06 --> 799.3389999999999
like you mentioned your own dad

801.0 --> 806.62
and that's what made me uh

804.54 --> 810.7199999999999
go a little hmm

806.62 --> 814.639
[Music]

810.72 --> 814.639
what I mean sorry

815.82 --> 823.32
take a joke I was giving you a joke

820.52 --> 824.459
[Music]

823.32 --> 827.9590000000001
foreign

824.459 --> 827.959
you didn't Spot It

830.519 --> 838.49
but maybe it's because it's it's gross

834.18 --> 841.9499999999999
anyway uh let's move on

838.49 --> 841.95
[Music]

847.1 --> 853.82
gross yes I know that's why I don't just

850.56 --> 853.8199999999999
overtly say it

855.079 --> 861.959
yeah but now it's on the table anyway

857.76 --> 864.22
and that's also a gross imagery anyway

861.959 --> 868.0899999999999
uh

864.22 --> 868.09
[Music]

868.98 --> 873.899
right anyway this brown guy is

871.32 --> 876.5
effectively not going to be a real

873.899 --> 876.5
Challenger

876.959 --> 879.38
right

881.279 --> 888.26
anyone got a ruler dude that is only a

884.88 --> 888.26
woman could say such a thing

888.72 --> 891.38
foreign

893.06 --> 897.7199999999999
wouldn't even come up with that idea

895.44 --> 899.1600000000001
unless they're really really gay and

897.72 --> 901.1800000000001
sadistic

899.16 --> 907.25
ugh

901.18 --> 907.25
[Music]

908.22 --> 912.3000000000001
or maybe that's just in my mind that I'm

910.74 --> 913.86
Auto assuming that that is what you're

912.3 --> 918.3199999999999
implying

913.86 --> 918.32
that's bollocks yeah that's even worse

920.459 --> 926.3599999999999
I mean now it's getting real dude where

923.04 --> 931.199
is this going and why stop it

926.36 --> 935.3000000000001
I'm talking to myself stop it

931.199 --> 935.3
oh Jesus uh

941.639 --> 945.32
cars what

945.779 --> 947.82
I don't

946.61 --> 950.519
[Music]

947.82 --> 951.47
hey drunken bullet411 good to see you

950.519 --> 967.45
it's been a while

951.47 --> 967.45
[Music]

974.519 --> 981.199
okay I at least oh this is going

977.699 --> 983.459
terrible directions I think that my

981.199 --> 984.959
innuendo might have gone down a

983.459 --> 986.9399999999999
different Lane

984.959 --> 990.8389999999999
because I wasn't actually talking about

986.94 --> 994.44
using a ruler to measure any of that

990.839 --> 996.3000000000001
because I keep on bringing out the ruler

994.44 --> 998.639
as an exam remember

996.3 --> 1000.2589999999999
slapping the ruler flat on the table to

998.639 --> 1002.12
give everybody's attention that's

1000.259 --> 1004.22
actually what I kind of was thinking

1002.12 --> 1007.66
about now that could be considered as

1004.22 --> 1007.6600000000001
worse in association

1007.94 --> 1016.7790000000001
but at least it's not as Petty as like

1010.579 --> 1016.779
measuring you know what anyway uh

1017.199 --> 1022.7589999999999
this is

1020.06 --> 1025.72
since this early bird show is starting

1022.759 --> 1025.72
out really weird

1026.36 --> 1029.1399999999999
uh

1029.2 --> 1033.069
[Music]

1033.799 --> 1037.339
what's the topic I don't really have a

1036.14 --> 1041.74
topic

1037.339 --> 1041.74
uh hey Gary with banga good to see you

1043.12 --> 1047.4799999999998
except for the cat that keeps on going

1045.74 --> 1048.559
back and forth

1047.48 --> 1050.679
okay

1048.559 --> 1050.6789999999999
okay

1052.52 --> 1058.9
oh yeah and of course

1055.82 --> 1058.8999999999999
I got a book

1059.96 --> 1062.74
I got it

1062.84 --> 1066.3999999999999
from Rudolph Steiner

1069.38 --> 1075.679
oh good oh the light Halo makes it so

1072.02 --> 1075.679
easy to read not

1076.46 --> 1084.26
yeah it's dutch anyway uh

1079.94 --> 1087.2
the science of the secrets of the Soul

1084.26 --> 1089.96
Rudolph Steiner

1087.2 --> 1092.179
I have to say I feel a bit silly for

1089.96 --> 1095.8400000000001
saying I'm kind of disappointed it's so

1092.179 --> 1098.8400000000001
damn thick damn it I have to read all

1095.84 --> 1101.299
this oh Jesus I just thought it was a

1098.84 --> 1103.8799999999999
little smaller but

1101.299 --> 1104.99
maybe that's a good thing after I get

1103.88 --> 1106.1000000000001
through it

1104.99 --> 1108.2
[Music]

1106.1 --> 1112.58
I mean it is apparently a very special

1108.2 --> 1115.28
book so I will read it but damn it it's

1112.58 --> 1117.9399999999998
almost 400 pages

1115.28 --> 1117.94
ugh

1120.559 --> 1125.12
look at me in my

1122.74 --> 1127.039
reading issues

1125.12 --> 1130.4189999999999
right but I'm sure that if I really get

1127.039 --> 1130.419
into it it's going to be awesome

1138.13 --> 1142.7
[Music]

1156.86 --> 1164.74
okay turret 48 hours before

1161.299 --> 1164.74
lunch canceling

1164.9 --> 1167.679
right

1176.84 --> 1182.9599999999998
I mean if that thing is actually gonna

1180.44 --> 1186.74
have witnesses that are physically

1182.96 --> 1188.419
standing there for real and like being

1186.74 --> 1190.64
on

1188.419 --> 1193.2800000000002
their mobile streaming or whatever

1190.64 --> 1195.7990000000002
recording and it's actually coming off

1193.28 --> 1200.1399999999999
the ground I'll be shocked

1195.799 --> 1200.1399999999999
oh I'll truly be shocked

1203.24 --> 1206.419
I don't think so it's never coming off

1205.52 --> 1209.799
the ground

1206.419 --> 1209.7990000000002
it's too ridiculous

1209.96 --> 1212.74
uh

1223.69 --> 1229.13
[Music]

1234.32 --> 1236.98
all right

1237.799 --> 1242.0
I did actually also watch a movie

1240.2 --> 1245.24
yesterday that turned out to be quite

1242.0 --> 1247.64
interesting it's an older movie

1245.24 --> 1250.58
like from the

1247.64 --> 1252.679
late 70s 80s or something

1250.58 --> 1255.02
or just 70s it could have been like

1252.679 --> 1256.64
straight 70 I I didn't actually check

1255.02 --> 1261.1
the date

1256.64 --> 1261.1000000000001
it's called Warlords of Atlantis

1261.74 --> 1266.419
that entire thing was all practical

1263.96 --> 1267.559
effects

1266.419 --> 1270.2
and

1267.559 --> 1273.5
like you could see there was practical

1270.2 --> 1274.82
effects but like it worked remarkably

1273.5 --> 1276.559
well

1274.82 --> 1280.76
I mean

1276.559 --> 1282.74
like really surprising how well that

1280.76 --> 1286.64
thing holds up

1282.74 --> 1289.039
even after like half a half a

1286.64 --> 1291.6200000000001
uh half a century

1289.039 --> 1294.3799999999999
it's pretty remarkable it was very

1291.62 --> 1297.08
entertaining very interesting lots of

1294.38 --> 1301.7
well it was basically an expose of like

1297.08 --> 1304.1589999999999
a Eugenics tartaria combination I mean

1301.7 --> 1308.1200000000001
it was pretty serious like that movie if

1304.159 --> 1310.64
you watch it now you'll be like huh

1308.12 --> 1312.6789999999999
that movie is almost like a

1310.64 --> 1315.14
summarization of the stuff that like

1312.679 --> 1319.2800000000002
Martin Luther talks about or something

1315.14 --> 1321.98
it's like it's about 50 years ago from

1319.28 --> 1324.22
another perspective focused on Atlantis

1321.98 --> 1324.22
and

1326.539 --> 1330.82
it was remarkably interesting

1341.2 --> 1347.539
78 right I totally called it with the

1343.94 --> 1350.02
late 70s early 80s

1347.539 --> 1350.02
right

1351.58 --> 1356.98
so it came out the same year as Star

1354.08 --> 1356.98
Wars huh

1360.38 --> 1362.5590000000002
thank you

1362.96 --> 1369.6200000000001
all right but it's

1365.78 --> 1372.86
it's really interesting movie like I

1369.62 --> 1374.9599999999998
recommend like you watch that

1372.86 --> 1377.9599999999998
especially if you've never seen anything

1374.96 --> 1380.9
if you haven't seen it before

1377.96 --> 1382.82
and well and you're here you're here to

1380.9 --> 1384.38
find the Flat Earth early bird show well

1382.82 --> 1385.52
this thing is going to be kind of

1384.38 --> 1387.7600000000002
interesting

1385.52 --> 1391.82
in different ways

1387.76 --> 1394.84
also there's there are like sort of

1391.82 --> 1394.84
silly things about it

1395.24 --> 1400.48
because of it's all practical effects

1397.52 --> 1400.48
but still like

1401.059 --> 1408.559
it really tries to be like on the edge

1404.62 --> 1412.7199999999998
sort of sci-fi like exploratory sci-fi

1408.559 --> 1412.72
in a very interesting way and

1413.12 --> 1419.299
and you can see that it's like from long

1415.64 --> 1421.94
ago but it just holds up so damn well

1419.299 --> 1423.559
like it's like when the first you see it

1421.94 --> 1426.14
you're like ah come on this is going to

1423.559 --> 1427.94
be kind of silly right but then like

1426.14 --> 1431.2990000000002
throughout the entire thing it's like

1427.94 --> 1432.559
wow it it did kind of hold up I'm

1431.299 --> 1436.6399999999999
surprised

1432.559 --> 1439.0
it yeah it's that is a very interesting

1436.64 --> 1439.0
movie

1439.1 --> 1447.28
and the special effects are like

1442.46 --> 1447.28
dated but still pretty spectacular

1450.14 --> 1457.0
what movie he talks about literally I

1452.72 --> 1457.0
literally it's it's in the chat

1457.84 --> 1465.32
pjcnet

1459.38 --> 1465.3200000000002
said it or Lords of Atlantis from 1978

1472.94 --> 1481.039
right and yes it it is also with some

1478.64 --> 1483.64
Globe nonsense sort of

1481.039 --> 1486.3799999999999
it's like they're supposed space travel

1483.64 --> 1488.539
involved but not in the movie itself

1486.38 --> 1491.24
it's like in the backstory

1488.539 --> 1494.179
which could also interestingly mean that

1491.24 --> 1496.76
the atlanteans could have made up

1494.179 --> 1499.4
outer space [ __ ] stories

1496.76 --> 1502.039
okay I don't want to spoil too much but

1499.4 --> 1504.6200000000001
they pretty much overtly admit

1502.039 --> 1507.62
on camera the atlanteans in the sort of

1504.62 --> 1509.78
expose that they are like masters of

1507.62 --> 1511.82
mental manipulation

1509.78 --> 1516.7
right

1511.82 --> 1516.7
so that's kind of interesting

1518.96 --> 1525.559
it to me was almost like an occult

1521.48 --> 1527.84
suggestion like yeah the atlanteans with

1525.559 --> 1530.4189999999999
their Mindcraft

1527.84 --> 1532.9399999999998
in the vision of the one who made this

1530.419 --> 1536.539
movie or who wrote it

1532.94 --> 1539.059
the story it's based on thought that the

1536.539 --> 1542.299
atlanteans basically created the

1539.059 --> 1545.0
delusions and well potentially the

1542.299 --> 1547.1
genetic engineering because that even

1545.0 --> 1549.919
though it's not overtly set there is

1547.1 --> 1555.1589999999999
like a physical manipulation through

1549.919 --> 1555.159
some radiant or sound tech I mean

1555.74 --> 1561.159
just look at it

1558.32 --> 1564.26
look at it and if you're like into

1561.159 --> 1566.5390000000002
intiquitect [ __ ] you'll be seeing this

1564.26 --> 1568.1589999999999
and realizing that of course the actual

1566.539 --> 1572.059
special effects are kind of like

1568.159 --> 1576.3200000000002
primitive but that the idea behind it

1572.059 --> 1579.98
is actually pretty damn well thought out

1576.32 --> 1583.52
it's it's it's not just somebody some

1579.98 --> 1586.82
kid playing with his Legos about it this

1583.52 --> 1590.539
is somebody that that put that together

1586.82 --> 1595.12
based on on wider research it's

1590.539 --> 1598.94
interesting it's really interesting

1595.12 --> 1601.34
also I had some very serious flashbacks

1598.94 --> 1604.039
to certain moments to what I experienced

1601.34 --> 1607.1
in my Dark World Visions personally

1604.039 --> 1611.059
which was even like a big scoop on top

1607.1 --> 1613.84
of that like what no way I experienced

1611.059 --> 1613.84
something like that

1615.26 --> 1618.679
like even yeah it's

1617.48 --> 1621.26
[Music]

1618.679 --> 1622.279
the movie blew my mind let's just say it

1621.26 --> 1626.059
like that

1622.279 --> 1629.059
but in a not in a painful way

1626.059 --> 1629.059
foreign

1629.659 --> 1638.5590000000002
anyway it's on Netflix so yeah

1634.88 --> 1638.5590000000002
I could probably find it somewhere else

1641.059 --> 1644.36
check it out

1642.5 --> 1645.98
if you're interested in like tartaria

1644.36 --> 1647.9599999999998
and tick with tech

1645.98 --> 1650.9
sort of thing

1647.96 --> 1653.24
this movie is actually pretty damn good

1650.9 --> 1657.039
for something that was made

1653.24 --> 1657.039
like over 50 years ago

1657.86 --> 1667.2199999999998
no wait almost 50 years ago not over

1661.82 --> 1669.559
let's put the 54 year no 44 years ago

1667.22 --> 1670.8
anyway

1669.559 --> 1675.19
uh

1670.8 --> 1675.19
[Music]

1686.299 --> 1690.94
I have it on my what

1694.7 --> 1697.299
foreign

1699.76 --> 1703.6589999999999
Artist movie what

1703.7 --> 1707.2
okay turret

1712.64 --> 1718.96
well if you could find like a

1716.12 --> 1721.82
a torrent link for that particular movie

1718.96 --> 1723.919
that's probably more effective for me to

1721.82 --> 1726.08
attempt to download it than like a

1723.919 --> 1727.76
direct transfer

1726.08 --> 1731.779
Derek

1727.76 --> 1734.06
so if you can actually found an a well a

1731.779 --> 1735.559
usable torrent link

1734.06 --> 1738.08
[Music]

1735.559 --> 1739.58
from where as long as that's just usable

1738.08 --> 1743.0
it's not

1739.58 --> 1744.799
polluted with viruses and [ __ ] then you

1743.0 --> 1747.52
could just send that to my email and I

1744.799 --> 1747.52
can download it

1748.4 --> 1750.8200000000002
anyway

1762.86 --> 1765.6999999999998
what are you talking about here we go

1764.96 --> 1769.3400000000001
again

1765.7 --> 1771.74
OA what is O A there we go again with

1769.34 --> 1774.76
the shorts

1771.74 --> 1774.76
what is that

1776.64 --> 1779.8590000000002
[Music]

1814.82 --> 1820.12
oh it's literally called that ugh I hate

1817.88 --> 1820.1200000000001
it

1820.7 --> 1826.059
I don't like series that do that

1823.34 --> 1827.779
it only makes this stupid

1826.059 --> 1830.559
shorting

1827.779 --> 1830.559
worse

1836.059 --> 1840.6789999999999
not [ __ ]

1838.159 --> 1842.419
I don't like I don't like series that do

1840.679 --> 1845.299
that just

1842.419 --> 1848.679
use words

1845.299 --> 1848.679
not letters

1851.6 --> 1853.779
foreign

1856.61 --> 1864.3999999999999
[Music]

1861.399 --> 1894.1499999999999
what the [ __ ] is that supposed to mean

1864.4 --> 1894.15
[Music]

1895.279 --> 1903.159
or original Angel oh my God

1899.799 --> 1903.1589999999999
go away

1930.86 --> 1935.24
yeah if its name is that gross yeah

1933.32 --> 1937.46
maybe it's better if you just call it

1935.24 --> 1941.99
away then

1937.46 --> 1945.14
to mask how [ __ ] gross the name is

1941.99 --> 1945.14
[Music]

1948.96 --> 1967.159
[Music]

1962.779 --> 1969.799
unless it's like a Christian series

1967.159 --> 1973.3400000000001
which you kind of doubt you'd find on

1969.799 --> 1976.24
Netflix so it's probably

1973.34 --> 1976.24
uh

1978.559 --> 1983.2
I don't want to know

1980.96 --> 1986.1200000000001
I'd like to not

1983.2 --> 1988.52
have this show be about you and your

1986.12 --> 1991.36
love for this supposed series

1988.52 --> 1991.36
how about that

1994.19 --> 2003.7
[Music]

1999.86 --> 2003.6999999999998
it's esoteric

2010.24 --> 2016.5
yeah Derek it is of course what else you

2013.84 --> 2016.5
think of it

2020.799 --> 2025.869
but you know what

2022.63 --> 2025.8690000000001
[Music]

2047.32 --> 2050.58
what are you talking about

2054.9 --> 2058.099
[Music]

2061.61 --> 2072.339

well as long as it's secure I'm fine

2174.64 --> 2178.96
with it

2370.87 --> 2377.64
[Music]

2373.359 --> 2377.64
I'll check it out later this weekend

2382.03 --> 2385.2290000000003
[Music]

2398.619 --> 2404.079
do permission cool

2400.88 --> 2404.079
[Music]

2407.86 --> 2412.159
[Music]

2417.94 --> 2421.48
you're not supposed to watch on

2420.16 --> 2423.3999999999996
principle

2421.48 --> 2425.32
why not

2423.4 --> 2427.56
here we go again what are you talking

2425.32 --> 2427.56
about

2431.98 --> 2436.2400000000002
right yeah five roads no and I'm really

2434.32 --> 2438.94
glad that you've been inspired I mean

2436.24 --> 2441.04
that's exactly what I want to do

2438.94 --> 2443.38
so I'm just really glad it's it's

2441.04 --> 2445.839
working for you

2443.38 --> 2447.339
because when I'm working for you and

2445.839 --> 2449.619
you're working for me and we're all

2447.339 --> 2451.7999999999997
working for each other and having a good

2449.619 --> 2451.8
time

2456.26 --> 2462.2400000000002
[Music]

2458.92 --> 2462.2400000000002
you got banned

2466.9 --> 2470.7400000000002
hmm

2469.24 --> 2473.68
yeah

2470.74 --> 2475.839
I think I'm gonna petition Nathan to do

2473.68 --> 2479.0789999999997
like a full unban because he like never

2475.839 --> 2481.42
does that you should just like unban

2479.079 --> 2483.579
everybody and then hey anybody who needs

2481.42 --> 2485.98
to be banned will just be banned again I

2483.579 --> 2489.4
mean it's not that big an issue

2485.98 --> 2492.9
it's just called a general cleanup

2489.4 --> 2496.359
because Nathan is not very

2492.9 --> 2499.359
meticulous as keeping track as to who is

2496.359 --> 2502.0
banned and isn't in his chat

2499.359 --> 2505.7799999999997
and the moderators can't do that for him

2502.0 --> 2507.94
like only he can do that

2505.78 --> 2511.2400000000002
so I'll ask him

2507.94 --> 2514.32
like hey could you do a uh

2511.24 --> 2514.3199999999997
a clean sweep

2514.72 --> 2518.5
and then if their asses [ __ ] come

2517.24 --> 2520.9799999999996
back we'll just kick them out

2518.5 --> 2520.98
immediately

2521.14 --> 2525.72
the million soccer counts or whatever

2527.079 --> 2532.96
criticized Paula oh they'll get it yeah

2529.96 --> 2537.4
they'll get you Ben

2532.96 --> 2541.44
dude if I wasn't like fed panelist

2537.4 --> 2541.44
with a wrench than I would have been Ben

2542.44 --> 2547.3
but uh yeah I don't think Paula really

2545.56 --> 2549.2799999999997
hangs around that much anymore after

2547.3 --> 2552.78
since after the last time after I

2549.28 --> 2552.78
basically well publicly

2553.26 --> 2558.82
denounced their action

2555.76 --> 2561.82
said like uh you're not

2558.82 --> 2564.579
this is not in the benefit for fed what

2561.82 --> 2567.4
you're doing right now

2564.579 --> 2570.88
you're being compulsive and you should

2567.4 --> 2573.96
keep doing that on your own show and not

2570.88 --> 2573.96
in Nathan's chat

2577.3 --> 2584.04
I'm gonna say oh wait Betty

2581.319 --> 2584.04
okay

2584.2 --> 2590.56
how the hell did that get you banned

2587.619 --> 2593.38
who's Paula

2590.56 --> 2596.2599999999998
okay steamy traveler you don't know it's

2593.38 --> 2599.52
like uh level up

2596.26 --> 2599.5200000000004
Bible literalist

2599.8 --> 2602.3900000000003
the woman that talks about the Bible a

2602.079 --> 2605.53
lot

2602.39 --> 2605.5299999999997
[Music]

2614.52 --> 2619.359
but apparently that's not who you were

2617.319 --> 2622.839
talking about brilliant getting the

2619.359 --> 2627.64
names wrong that's great it's great

2622.839 --> 2629.27
so doesn't make me look weird at all

2627.64 --> 2633.979
thanks

2629.27 --> 2633.979
[Music]

2649.3 --> 2655.119
she was apologizing for sleeping

2653.319 --> 2658.3
[ __ ]

2655.119 --> 2661.48
yeah I sorry I don't listen to Paul to

2658.3 --> 2663.52
Betty I'd rather listen to Paula when it

2661.48 --> 2666.28
comes to biblical things really

2663.52 --> 2668.079
because at least that's a lady that gets

2666.28 --> 2670.96
it right that really does her best to

2668.079 --> 2673.1800000000003
get the well the priest constructions

2670.96 --> 2676.06
right I mean I think it's technically

2673.18 --> 2677.859
ridiculous to even do that but if you're

2676.06 --> 2679.72
gonna do that then you should at least

2677.859 --> 2682.119
try to do it right and she well is

2679.72 --> 2685.359
trying to do that right

2682.119 --> 2687.6400000000003
in that sense it's kind of like 10th Man

2685.359 --> 2688.66
although I think the ant man's is better

2687.64 --> 2691.74
at it

2688.66 --> 2694.1299999999997
he actually has more grip on his own

2691.74 --> 2695.2599999999998
character Paula

2694.13 --> 2698.7400000000002
[Music]

2695.26 --> 2700.6600000000003
Paula's issues right but Betty Betty

2698.74 --> 2703.9599999999996
goes in all kinds of directions and I

2700.66 --> 2707.44
it's like her own

2703.96 --> 2708.46
I mean she is technically eclectic like

2707.44 --> 2711.2400000000002
me

2708.46 --> 2711.2400000000002
but

2712.48 --> 2718.72
yeah

2715.24 --> 2722.0789999999997
I don't exactly take what she says as

2718.72 --> 2724.74
like oh yeah that's really important

2722.079 --> 2724.7400000000002
uh

2725.319 --> 2729.7599999999998
because it's just her interpretations

2727.48 --> 2730.96
basically it's like

2729.76 --> 2733.599
yeah

2730.96 --> 2737.44
I mean

2733.599 --> 2740.7000000000003
I'm not widely impressed by Betty's

2737.44 --> 2740.7000000000003
biblical ideas

2748.18 --> 2754.18
and like things like apologize like

2750.76 --> 2756.88
apologizing for anything

2754.18 --> 2758.9199999999996
in the past that you're not a part of is

2756.88 --> 2761.6800000000003
ridiculous

2758.92 --> 2765.7000000000003
it's ridiculous to do that and it's it's

2761.68 --> 2768.22
also Petty it is

2765.7 --> 2772.2599999999998
it proves that you literally don't

2768.22 --> 2772.2599999999998
understand what that book even is

2772.78 --> 2777.3390000000004
and that these things are there for you

2775.66 --> 2779.14
to learn about

2777.339 --> 2783.099
and like why the hell would you

2779.14 --> 2785.44
apologize for something that people did

2783.099 --> 2786.6400000000003
thousands of years ago

2785.44 --> 2788.68
is

2786.64 --> 2789.94
like what what the [ __ ] are you talking

2788.68 --> 2792.819
about

2789.94 --> 2797.14
I mean it it might have had a very good

2792.819 --> 2799.119
reason to even exist things usually do

2797.14 --> 2802.7799999999997
yeah

2799.119 --> 2804.4
and besides the entire concept of

2802.78 --> 2806.52
slavery has been

2804.4 --> 2809.5
like drawn

2806.52 --> 2813.359
vastly out of proportion to what it

2809.5 --> 2813.359
actually is and how it's used

2816.46 --> 2822.28
right so it's like oh these movies that

2819.52 --> 2825.0
we are the slave tortured the evil

2822.28 --> 2828.099
bosses that are enjoying

2825.0 --> 2830.74
Gladiator like spectacles

2828.099 --> 2835.0
because he has no respect like I mean

2830.74 --> 2837.5789999999997
that is all grossly exaggerated and

2835.0 --> 2839.68
definitely not the average

2837.579 --> 2842.8
I mean those are like

2839.68 --> 2845.859
the worst cases right that's like if you

2842.8 --> 2847.0
said that all relationship between men

2845.859 --> 2850.0
and women

2847.0 --> 2853.68
like always end up in the the woman

2850.0 --> 2858.94
getting beaten or something right I mean

2853.68 --> 2865.1189999999997
no no that doesn't actually happen

2858.94 --> 2869.76
at all but yeah it happens to some

2865.119 --> 2869.76
not to everybody I mean come on

2871.14 --> 2876.7
right so why would you think that

2874.18 --> 2879.52
slavery would always be like these

2876.7 --> 2881.3799999999997
people just getting humiliated and

2879.52 --> 2884.2599999999998
tortured to death slowly or something

2881.38 --> 2885.04
right I mean what the [ __ ] man what the

2884.26 --> 2887.94
[ __ ]

2885.04 --> 2887.94
ridiculous

2894.099 --> 2902.2000000000003
right slavery can also be an arrangement

2898.3 --> 2903.96
and hey if a slave master is actually a

2902.2 --> 2908.319
decent human being

2903.96 --> 2910.78
that as a way of going about that you as

2908.319 --> 2913.359
a slave have an opportunity to well

2910.78 --> 2914.8
deserve your or to earn your freedom

2913.359 --> 2917.319
again

2914.8 --> 2919.599
and that it is actual and not just like

2917.319 --> 2923.68
so a fake dream to hang over their heads

2919.599 --> 2926.8590000000004
right this is real with rules

2923.68 --> 2929.339
yeah then it's actually you might be

2926.859 --> 2932.38
surprised how good that can work

2929.339 --> 2934.839
how effective it can be for an

2932.38 --> 2936.7000000000003
individual that is just completely has

2934.839 --> 2938.7999999999997
no more grip on the world is like

2936.7 --> 2940.72
everything crashed the family died or

2938.8 --> 2941.8
you got kicked out of the country or

2940.72 --> 2945.339
whatever

2941.8 --> 2948.2200000000003
and then what the [ __ ] you do then well

2945.339 --> 2952.18
if there's like a really good

2948.22 --> 2953.6189999999997
uh like business owner uh even with

2952.18 --> 2956.5
plantations

2953.619 --> 2959.52
and and then suddenly you can just

2956.5 --> 2962.74
relatively quickly have a secure place

2959.52 --> 2965.44
where you can get food you'll like never

2962.74 --> 2967.4199999999996
completely starve and and you have

2965.44 --> 2969.819
something to do every day and there's

2967.42 --> 2971.44
other people too that are in the same

2969.819 --> 2973.859
position and they're all having their

2971.44 --> 2977.38
own background stories and

2973.859 --> 2980.319
Road of learning within the process

2977.38 --> 2982.3
right it I mean it can be therapeutical

2980.319 --> 2984.7599999999998
sounds weird to say that right slavery

2982.3 --> 2986.17
can be therapeutical

2984.76 --> 2987.3390000000004
however

2986.17 --> 2990.339
[Music]

2987.339 --> 2994.359
it's true if the circumstances are right

2990.339 --> 2997.2999999999997
if you're not just like in prison and

2994.359 --> 2998.859
like you're no longer treated as a human

2997.3 --> 3001.02
being

2998.859 --> 3004.02
but if you're just to have

3001.02 --> 3005.7599999999998
the other form

3004.02 --> 3007.8
then

3005.76 --> 3010.92
it can be great

3007.8 --> 3013.619
it can't work so this is kind of also

3010.92 --> 3015.599
based on the ideas of Owen Benjamin what

3013.619 --> 3018.02
he's been talking about and I just agree

3015.599 --> 3018.02
to that

3018.54 --> 3026.48
I mean slavery doesn't always have to be

3023.04 --> 3026.48
torture and death

3026.94 --> 3031.7400000000002
and an affront to God

3029.28 --> 3035.46
it can also be a

3031.74 --> 3038.0989999999997
a agreement of service

3035.46 --> 3042.02
and provision

3038.099 --> 3044.7000000000003
that isn't just only routed in financial

3042.02 --> 3048.599
Financial agreements

3044.7 --> 3051.359
and more but more close more personal

3048.599 --> 3054.3590000000004
right anyway

3051.359 --> 3057.14
felt like a slave in school well

3054.359 --> 3057.14
interesting

3060.96 --> 3063.559
uh

3066.3 --> 3070.2000000000003
no don't worry about it five routes I

3068.64 --> 3073.7599999999998
think here we go again is mostly

3070.2 --> 3073.7599999999998
clogging up the chats here

3074.4 --> 3077.059
you know

3080.16 --> 3085.0989999999997
I think an agreement to service is a job

3086.98 --> 3091.92
[Music]

3098.819 --> 3103.22
okay and what if it's

3103.38 --> 3108.3
like a trade-off

3105.54 --> 3110.16
for punishment like for if you're like

3108.3 --> 3112.8590000000004
actually a criminal everything went to

3110.16 --> 3114.7799999999997
ship you did some really [ __ ] stupid

3112.859 --> 3119.04
things

3114.78 --> 3123.3590000000004
and then it's like oh prison or

3119.04 --> 3126.14
you can basically be a laborer for this

3123.359 --> 3126.14
person

3127.44 --> 3132.96
I mean that's pretty close to like

3129.839 --> 3135.119
endangered servitude and all that

3132.96 --> 3138.66
but

3135.119 --> 3141.6600000000003
is that horrible

3138.66 --> 3141.66
foreign

3149.78 --> 3153.38
okay fine

3156.359 --> 3161.64
slavery doesn't come with an agreement

3158.16 --> 3163.74
yeah but it it does or it did

3161.64 --> 3167.7
at least come

3163.74 --> 3170.819
with very specific rules right

3167.7 --> 3174.02
um what on how to treat your slaves and

3170.819 --> 3174.02
what not to do

3174.119 --> 3180.619
all that and like

3177.3 --> 3180.619
a code of conduct

3210.96 --> 3215.0
different levels of slavery right

3215.04 --> 3221.88
anyway I think it's just been overly put

3218.339 --> 3225.359
yeah pulled out of proportion and like

3221.88 --> 3229.2200000000003
been hammered on Extreme drama versions

3225.359 --> 3229.22
of it I mean it's pretty blatant

3229.559 --> 3234.1800000000003
and I think that the way people think

3232.14 --> 3236.64
and feel about it is just completely

3234.18 --> 3238.02
unreasonable and based well

3236.64 --> 3241.92
um totally

3238.02 --> 3243.619
pulled out of proportion scenarios that

3241.92 --> 3248.54
have been

3243.619 --> 3248.54
blatantly highlighted in Media

3255.42 --> 3261.359
mm-hmm okay LSG

3258.54 --> 3264.44
wow that's

3261.359 --> 3264.44
that's quite a lot

3274.02 --> 3279.079
that's a pretty tough punishment I'd say

3281.04 --> 3286.8
okay well here we go again uh I don't

3284.76 --> 3289.579
care yeah

3286.8 --> 3289.579
I don't care

3293.94 --> 3299.819
don't care for your outrage

3296.52 --> 3301.14
so you better stop your feminist protest

3299.819 --> 3303.599
here

3301.14 --> 3305.839
because that's not what this channel is

3303.599 --> 3305.839
for

3311.22 --> 3319.5
and I will defend whatever

3314.4 --> 3323.0
I please to defend whether others deem

3319.5 --> 3323.0
it as reasonable or not

3331.77 --> 3335.03
[Music]

3337.8 --> 3341.8390000000004
[Music]

3349.579 --> 3353.059
Spartacus yeah yeah

3355.74 --> 3359.839
it was a very long movie indeed

3361.619 --> 3366.859
so it would be okay to be a slave well

3364.92 --> 3371.52
that all depends on the circumstances

3366.859 --> 3375.2999999999997
but I actually as an individual

3371.52 --> 3378.54
can be very good as a slave

3375.3 --> 3381.54
because I like

3378.54 --> 3381.54
servicing

3382.14 --> 3384.98
practically

3394.619 --> 3399.44
what the [ __ ] are you talking about here

3396.9 --> 3399.44
we go again

3416.04 --> 3421.319
are you [ __ ] threatening me

3419.579 --> 3424.079
here we go again

3421.319 --> 3426.18
are you actually going there is it time

3424.079 --> 3428.42
for you to get the [ __ ] out of my show

3426.18 --> 3428.4199999999996
again

3451.26 --> 3458.96
yeah I guess you are bye

3455.52 --> 3458.96
take care now

3481.16 --> 3484.31
[Music]

3516.359 --> 3518.54
thank you

3518.67 --> 3521.88
[Music]

3524.76 --> 3529.98
right but anyway to get back to the rest

3528.0 --> 3532.5
of the people in the chat that might be

3529.98 --> 3534.42
a little bit more reasonable and can

3532.5 --> 3537.14
actually have a discussion without going

3534.42 --> 3537.14
ballistic

3537.96 --> 3544.079
right

3539.78 --> 3546.299
yeah what Godzilla said for example

3544.079 --> 3548.04
like if slavery doesn't come with an

3546.299 --> 3550.619
agreement yeah if you're just a person

3548.04 --> 3553.2
that gets snatched off the street and

3550.619 --> 3554.4
you actually have a life and parents or

3553.2 --> 3557.52
whatever

3554.4 --> 3559.76
yeah I [ __ ] don't agree to that of

3557.52 --> 3559.7599999999998
course

3561.78 --> 3567.42
I mean

3563.94 --> 3569.819
it seems only logical that it would

3567.42 --> 3572.579
never ever

3569.819 --> 3577.46
be legal under any circumstance to

3572.579 --> 3577.46
secretly have slaves ever

3577.98 --> 3585.359
if it's gonna be legal in a way then it

3581.819 --> 3586.68
should never be a secret because

3585.359 --> 3588.14
yeah

3586.68 --> 3593.5499999999997
there's responsibilities

3588.14 --> 3593.5499999999997
[Music]

3600.299 --> 3605.28
and yeah besides like just stealing

3603.24 --> 3609.4199999999996
citizens

3605.28 --> 3612.3590000000004
to enslave is also yeah a blatant

3609.42 --> 3615.14
violation of people's rights so

3612.359 --> 3615.14
I mean

3616.98 --> 3623.18
I'm just saying there's more ways to

3620.339 --> 3625.5589999999997
think about it than just

3623.18 --> 3626.7
[Music]

3625.559 --> 3629.299
yeah that's all

3626.7 --> 3629.299
think

3645.78 --> 3653.0
or not or what the [ __ ]

3649.38 --> 3655.799
hello hello anybody still in chat there

3653.0 --> 3658.2
seven [ __ ] minutes of silence I'm

3655.799 --> 3660.08
getting pissed off

3658.2 --> 3662.9399999999996
the hell is this

3660.08 --> 3664.38
[Music]

3662.94 --> 3667.859
oh wait what

3664.38 --> 3671.6400000000003
no no what okay

3667.859 --> 3673.5
the chat just was frozen

3671.64 --> 3676.3799999999997
what the hell

3673.5 --> 3678.66
okay this is not you guys just did it

3676.38 --> 3680.339
didn't show I had to refresh and now the

3678.66 --> 3683.1189999999997
chat is all filled up again this is

3680.339 --> 3683.119
really weird

3683.4 --> 3686.599
the [ __ ] happened

3687.599 --> 3690.1400000000003
all right

3691.35 --> 3699.2599999999998
[Music]

3703.98 --> 3708.799
uh LSG yeah she doesn't have a husband

3709.14 --> 3714.42
at least not that I know of

3712.02 --> 3717.079
she didn't the last time we actually

3714.42 --> 3717.079
talked

3725.7 --> 3732.359
and I think there are some reasons to

3728.88 --> 3735.119
figure out why

3732.359 --> 3738.9
regularly refresh okay well I don't

3735.119 --> 3741.6800000000003
typically but uh yeah you're still there

3738.9 --> 3741.6800000000003
so don't worry

3742.02 --> 3746.4
it just seemed like there was eight

3744.059 --> 3748.4
minutes of silence but there wasn't

3746.4 --> 3753.14
you guys said a whole bunch of things

3748.4 --> 3753.14
very odd that they just stopped

3773.22 --> 3781.04
right so yeah let's not just talk about

3776.54 --> 3783.9
the one movie Django unchanging

3781.04 --> 3785.359
yeah that [ __ ] movie is the entire

3783.9 --> 3788.52
problem

3785.359 --> 3791.7599999999998
it's such a stereotyped piece of [ __ ]

3788.52 --> 3796.2599999999998
that entire thing

3791.76 --> 3798.5400000000004
and now like everybody knows that one

3796.26 --> 3802.2200000000003
[ __ ] move in every time slavery's

3798.54 --> 3806.2799999999997
brought up every Star everyone always

3802.22 --> 3809.66
starts blabbering about that movie and

3806.28 --> 3809.6600000000003
that is the problem

3811.44 --> 3817.94
because everybody just thinks it's that

3814.38 --> 3817.94
totally [ __ ]

3818.28 --> 3823.26
even though I mean like the the house

3820.98 --> 3827.64
the house [ __ ]

3823.26 --> 3831.1800000000003
yeah he did that role was pretty

3827.64 --> 3834.319
well done once again uh that pretty

3831.18 --> 3834.319
famous actor uh

3835.61 --> 3841.969
[Music]

3846.839 --> 3853.38
I feel stupid I mean he is pretty famous

3850.619 --> 3856.2000000000003
but yeah that

3853.38 --> 3859.7400000000002
that actor did a really good job

3856.2 --> 3864.2599999999998
like acting that role

3859.74 --> 3864.2599999999998
but the entire setup was just

3864.599 --> 3868.52
way too much over the top

3870.24 --> 3873.18
yeah I'm Samuel objection that's it

3872.22 --> 3874.319
thanks

3873.18 --> 3877.04
what's that

3874.319 --> 3877.04
I'm seeing each other

3878.099 --> 3884.7200000000003
access restricted oh yippee that doesn't

3881.46 --> 3884.7200000000003
work here steamy Traveler

3891.119 --> 3895.7400000000002
a fireball that stripped across the

3893.339 --> 3899.64

3895.74 --> 3904.14
[Music]

3899.64 --> 3905.359
I did see like a fireball in the movie

3904.14 --> 3908.2799999999997
yesterday

3905.359 --> 3910.2599999999998
weirdly enough literally that was part

3908.28 --> 3913.52
of the backstory like a big Fireball

3910.26 --> 3913.5200000000004
going across the sky

3914.4 --> 3920.339
so that's kind of weird

3916.98 --> 3922.52
talking about uh Warlords of Atlantis

3920.339 --> 3922.52
again

3937.68 --> 3943.5
but yeah unfortunately I can't uh watch

3940.619 --> 3948.5
that link it doesn't work for my region

3943.5 --> 3948.5

4090.859 --> 4096.94
huh

4092.599 --> 4096.9400000000005
okay so yeah a meteor

4103.339 --> 4110.839
wow well it it only lasted like half a

4106.88 --> 4113.0
second so I thought it was more like

4110.839 --> 4115.16
like a comet sighting or something but I

4113.0 --> 4117.799
guess it's just the meteor okay well

4115.16 --> 4121.12
that happened then I guess

4117.799 --> 4121.12
thanks for sharing

4123.799 --> 4129.5
blah blah blah whatever they say about

4126.799 --> 4131.359
it it doesn't matter from looking at it

4129.5 --> 4134.579
that's just a meteor

4135.199 --> 4138.099999999999

4138.679 --> 4145.58
don't you agree looking at it

4142.4 --> 4147.3189999999995
whatever they say the speed or even the

4145.58 --> 4150.759
distance who cares

4147.319 --> 4150.759
it's probably all nonsense

4152.37 --> 4157.719
[Music]

4154.4 --> 4157.719
just looks like a meteor

4172.52 --> 4177.819
what would it be then a meteor

4178.4 --> 4184.12
where do they come from

4181.279 --> 4184.120000000001
somewhere

4187.759 --> 4193.219
meteors are a mystery and they always

4190.699 --> 4195.379999999999
probably will be or unless somebody

4193.219 --> 4197.66
actually just like comes out of the

4195.38 --> 4199.16
closet big time from the Freemasons or

4197.66 --> 4200.9
whatever says like oh yeah we've

4199.16 --> 4202.76
actually been catapulting these things

4200.9 --> 4204.5599999999995
for like the last 400 years

4202.76 --> 4206.900000000001
[Music]

4204.56 --> 4210.1990000000005
I don't know

4206.9 --> 4213.139999999999
and if not then they probably don't even

4210.199 --> 4216.379999999999
know it's like yeah they just fall from

4213.14 --> 4217.9400000000005
the sky we don't know we don't know

4216.38 --> 4220.46
what's even up there we've never

4217.94 --> 4222.62
actually been there and scanned things

4220.46 --> 4223.52
but just yeah they just keep coming from

4222.62 --> 4226.219
there

4223.52 --> 4228.92
we don't know why maybe they literally

4226.219 --> 4231.56
just phase into physical existence like

4228.92 --> 4234.8
be cloaking From Another Dimension and

4231.56 --> 4238.2390000000005
they just materialize and just do that

4234.8 --> 4238.2390000000005
I don't know

4241.219 --> 4249.199
I had this weird idea once where maybe

4245.3 --> 4251.320000000001
meteors would be part of like the

4249.199 --> 4253.879999999999
uh

4251.32 --> 4255.259999999999
the environment

4253.88 --> 4257.78
where

4255.26 --> 4260.360000000001
there might be yeah there was a pretty

4257.78 --> 4264.0199999999995
silly idea in retrospect but still kind

4260.36 --> 4268.759999999999
of at least I had an idea about it an

4264.02 --> 4271.34
idea at all right the idea that

4268.76 --> 4273.8
yeah what if hydrogen and helium which

4271.34 --> 4276.4400000000005
is supposed to be high up what if they

4273.8 --> 4280.9400000000005
actually somehow

4276.44 --> 4282.739
through electricity were transmuted

4280.94 --> 4285.259999999999
into

4282.739 --> 4287.0
into silicon or something into other

4285.26 --> 4289.46
material what if there's some weird

4287.0 --> 4292.46
electrical process up there that

4289.46 --> 4294.199
basically transforms

4292.46 --> 4296.78
those gases

4294.199 --> 4298.099999999999
right because if not then where is it

4296.78 --> 4300.5599999999995
all going

4298.1 --> 4302.719
then it would have to all be reabsorbed

4300.56 --> 4304.04
by the material again or if the pressure

4302.719 --> 4306.92
would keep building and building and

4304.04 --> 4309.62
building because gas is actually created

4306.92 --> 4311.719
in the ground comes out of the ground so

4309.62 --> 4313.4
either the pressure would be building up

4311.719 --> 4316.94
or it's

4313.4 --> 4320.179
all reabsorbed somehow

4316.94 --> 4322.4
or it's going into something else and

4320.179 --> 4324.14
that might be like a weird Transformer

4322.4 --> 4327.679
that basically the more gas pressure

4324.14 --> 4330.26
builds up the more helium and hydrogen

4327.679 --> 4333.86
gets pushed up that eventually then

4330.26 --> 4336.38
reach the Transformer thing some point

4333.86 --> 4337.639999999999
or whatever I don't know man I have no

4336.38 --> 4339.26
idea

4337.64 --> 4341.780000000001
how that would work

4339.26 --> 4344.0
that would literally just materialize

4341.78 --> 4347.179
him into rocks and then maybe they kind

4344.0 --> 4349.699
of like float up there around that

4347.179 --> 4351.62
processor which would be far out of side

4349.699 --> 4355.699
nobody would ever actually see that

4351.62 --> 4359.12
could be so far up it could be like

4355.699 --> 4362.0599999999995
a thing just stuck

4359.12 --> 4363.8
to the ceiling or something way out of

4362.06 --> 4367.159000000001
sight and

4363.8 --> 4369.1990000000005
that it literally transforms the gases

4367.159 --> 4370.639999999999
into meteors and then if they get enough

4369.199 --> 4372.739
Mass

4370.64 --> 4375.5
that they'll like

4372.739 --> 4379.159
get slung off

4375.5 --> 4381.199
their electric electrostatic bound cycle

4379.159 --> 4383.48
magnetic cycle whatever from the

4381.199 --> 4385.28
Transformer and then just start dropping

4383.48 --> 4387.799999999999
so that there might be a direct

4385.28 --> 4390.92
correlation to oh gas buildup

4387.8 --> 4394.34
and then later meteor come down

4390.92 --> 4396.8
right and then there is another cycle

4394.34 --> 4398.96
that will keep it all going so that's

4396.8 --> 4400.9400000000005
how I originally reasoned it out like a

4398.96 --> 4404.179
few years ago

4400.94 --> 4408.44
that maybe meteors are naturally formed

4404.179 --> 4410.2390000000005
somehow within the design of this system

4408.44 --> 4413.719
to

4410.239 --> 4416.239
to take away some of the

4413.719 --> 4418.159
yeah super low density gases and

4416.239 --> 4421.759999999999
transform them into it

4418.159 --> 4424.759999999999
so that the cycle can keep going

4421.76 --> 4426.860000000001
right that was an alternative idea a lot

4424.76 --> 4428.2390000000005
of people thought it was really

4426.86 --> 4431.719
hysterical

4428.239 --> 4434.9
enough to send trolls out to say oh or

4431.719 --> 4436.28
when police meteors are made of helium

4434.9 --> 4437.54
oh

4436.28 --> 4442.54
yeah

4437.54 --> 4442.54
well at least I had an idea about it

4444.58 --> 4449.659
is that why there's a gradient too

4446.96 --> 4452.84
through the meteor generator no

4449.659 --> 4455.299999999999
now the gradient is definitely there due

4452.84 --> 4458.42
to a temperature differential

4455.3 --> 4459.26
because up there whatever is there it's

4458.42 --> 4462.56
cold

4459.26 --> 4464.84
down here it's warm even by just the

4462.56 --> 4467.6
influence of sunlight alone

4464.84 --> 4470.84
touching the surface heating it up and

4467.6 --> 4474.4400000000005
there is also geothermal heat

4470.84 --> 4477.14
so for some reason so there is a natural

4474.44 --> 4479.0599999999995
gradation effect already present that is

4477.14 --> 4482.6
definitely the cause of the gradient

4479.06 --> 4484.34
within a realm gas pressure gradient is

4482.6 --> 4487.34
the temperature differential and you can

4484.34 --> 4489.679
even demonstrate how that works

4487.34 --> 4492.56
with an aquarium of gas

4489.679 --> 4495.56
apply heat one side

4492.56 --> 4499.4800000000005
go to the other and gradient within the

4495.56 --> 4499.4800000000005
gas will measurably form

4502.1 --> 4506.56
isn't gas more dense when it's cold

4513.52 --> 4519.860000000001
if yeah technically but that is like it

4518.36 --> 4523.759999999999
is kind of a tricky question because

4519.86 --> 4527.0
that's like okay so you have a gas tank

4523.76 --> 4530.12
there is gas in there

4527.0 --> 4531.86
right then you make it cold what happens

4530.12 --> 4535.28
to the gas

4531.86 --> 4538.299999999999
yeah it technically shrinks and then

4535.28 --> 4538.3
becomes denser

4538.58 --> 4546.64
if it has the ability to shrink

4542.42 --> 4546.64
if it has that room to do that

4561.32 --> 4568.759999999999
right because for shrinkage it also well

4564.98 --> 4571.218999999999
requires the volume to compensate so if

4568.76 --> 4573.8
there's like a lot of gas around one

4571.219 --> 4577.64
part gets cold yeah you get the cold

4573.8 --> 4581.3
front effect it becomes condenser

4577.64 --> 4584.06
basically creates a void that then the

4581.3 --> 4589.04
the warmer stuff around is gonna move

4584.06 --> 4590.42
towards it to fill up that that cold

4589.04 --> 4593.5
front

4590.42 --> 4593.5
effect right

4605.78 --> 4612.44
but yeah if there is no gas around to

4610.4 --> 4614.839999999999
fill it up the mood that's warmer to

4612.44 --> 4617.44
move towards it and fill it up then it

4614.84 --> 4617.4400000000005
won't do that

4617.659 --> 4624.32
so way up there there is no

4621.56 --> 4627.38
take your gas fronts

4624.32 --> 4630.139999999999
to basically well

4627.38 --> 4633.1990000000005
fill up the volume

4630.14 --> 4634.76
for the shrinkage so it's yeah it's just

4633.199 --> 4637.099999999999
kind of like

4634.76 --> 4639.02
stretched out cold

4637.1 --> 4641.06
it just doesn't have room to actually

4639.02 --> 4643.040000000001
shrink

4641.06 --> 4645.820000000001
that's what we have that's how I'm

4643.04 --> 4645.82
imagining it

4646.699 --> 4652.04
although maybe I'm technically incorrect

4648.8 --> 4654.860000000001
In how this works I have to

4652.04 --> 4656.84
hear Adam making out or John

4654.86 --> 4660.58
about it

4656.84 --> 4660.58
I think I'm pretty much calling it

4664.04 --> 4672.34
put hot gas be higher than the cold gas

4668.739 --> 4672.339999999999
what does that mean

4673.88 --> 4678.9800000000005
what do you mean be higher

4676.04 --> 4682.36
I mean in hot gas in relation to cold

4678.98 --> 4682.36
gas will move up

4686.12 --> 4691.88
right that's the thing it's less dense

4689.6 --> 4694.52
or if it's hotter it's gonna

4691.88 --> 4699.1990000000005
spread out in all directions but

4694.52 --> 4701.2390000000005
slightly biased upwards because that's

4699.199 --> 4704.78
where yeah

4701.239 --> 4706.639999999999
kind of the buoyant effect sort of

4704.78 --> 4708.44
it's just gonna move yeah spread out in

4706.64 --> 4712.400000000001
that direction now if you have really

4708.44 --> 4714.678999999999
high density and cold gas and you pour

4712.4 --> 4716.719
it out in the open it's going to spread

4714.679 --> 4719.54
out in all the directions but be

4716.719 --> 4723.199
slightly more preferencing to downwards

4719.54 --> 4725.12
because it's denser and colder than the

4723.199 --> 4727.82
surrounding gas and eventually it'll

4725.12 --> 4729.44
spread out completely because those

4727.82 --> 4731.78
differentials will

4729.44 --> 4735.759999999999
no longer matter it will become one with

4731.78 --> 4735.759999999999
the inhomogeneous mesh

4736.94 --> 4741.799999999999
on air rise yeah it does and I I just

4740.3 --> 4746.54
explained that

4741.8 --> 4747.860000000001
it's less dense gas or it's hot or both

4746.54 --> 4750.38
it's going to spread out in all

4747.86 --> 4753.799999999999
directions with a slight bias upwards

4750.38 --> 4756.219
because that's where less dense things

4753.8 --> 4756.219
go

4757.219 --> 4761.32
as it is spreading out in all directions

4762.5 --> 4764.8

[Music]

4797.719 --> 4802.659
Tintin gets colder should get up in the

4800.54 --> 4802.659
sky

4818.06 --> 4822.8
well that's what happens like if you go

4820.699 --> 4824.9
if you're in a pressure chamber it will

4822.8 --> 4827.06
feel warmer because of the higher

4824.9 --> 4829.339999999999
pressure if you're in a lower pressure

4827.06 --> 4831.7390000000005
chamber you will probably start to feel

4829.34 --> 4834.92
colder

4831.739 --> 4837.639999999999
I think hey paraplegic bear

4834.92 --> 4837.64
how are you doing

4837.8 --> 4842.6
I'm doing great

4840.44 --> 4846.4
it's beautiful weather out here wow it's

4842.6 --> 4846.400000000001
even better looking now check this out

foreign

4875.98 --> 4882.249
[Music]

4882.92 --> 4888.14
right but the point of steamy traveler

4885.08 --> 4890.42
is that there is it's technically

4888.14 --> 4892.6990000000005
logical that it would be called at a

4890.42 --> 4895.6990000000005
higher up you go because above there is

4892.699 --> 4898.699
a cold influence

4895.699 --> 4902.12
there's like a cold element or something

4898.699 --> 4904.48
something that is literally taking away

4902.12 --> 4904.48
Heat

4905.3 --> 4911.2390000000005
probably the ceiling

4908.96 --> 4912.679
I mean this ceiling might literally be

4911.239 --> 4916.419999999999
like

4912.679 --> 4916.42
super super cold

4917.9 --> 4923.86
maybe there is even like ice

4920.84 --> 4923.860000000001
stuck to it

4923.96 --> 4927.92
and then it like shakes off or something

4926.179 --> 4929.659
I don't know

4927.92 --> 4932.0
because there's a big chance yeah I

4929.659 --> 4935.0
don't know man it's just the upper

4932.0 --> 4937.1
barrier the container Berry is

4935.0 --> 4939.679
it's going to be a mystery for a while

4937.1 --> 4943.280000000001
I've

4939.679 --> 4947.6
had so many ideas about what it's like

4943.28 --> 4949.759999999999
but it just there is a cold influence it

4947.6 --> 4953.120000000001
has to be there because there is a

4949.76 --> 4955.88
gradient it would make any sense for a

4953.12 --> 4958.58
gradient to be here if there wasn't a

4955.88 --> 4961.46
cold influence up there

4958.58 --> 4963.86
non-space absorb the heat no now that

4961.46 --> 4965.4800000000005
that would technically be impossible you

4963.86 --> 4968.96
see heat

4965.48 --> 4971.78
can only be transferred or absorbed if

4968.96 --> 4975.62
they're by molecules by matter being

4971.78 --> 4978.259999999999
there non-space is literally not matter

4975.62 --> 4981.739
so there's literally nothing there to

4978.26 --> 4985.360000000001
transfer or absorb the Heat

4981.739 --> 4985.36
so that cannot be it

4986.179 --> 4991.12
so maybe there's like a giant fridge up

4988.52 --> 4991.120000000001
there or something

4992.659 --> 4997.0
or maybe the cold influence

4999.28 --> 5002.759999999999
I don't know

5014.02 --> 5019.740000000001
enough about the Blue Sky eyes not

5016.9 --> 5022.299999999999
dismiss it yeah but uh

[Music]

5022.3 --> 5029.08
yeah those blue sky uh nice stories I

5026.02 --> 5031.179
would not trust those but

5029.08 --> 5035.679
look we don't know

5031.179 --> 5037.96
there might be ice up there right it

5035.679 --> 5040.84
might be non-space

5037.96 --> 5041.92
with like a layer of ice just stuck to

5040.84 --> 5044.26
it

5041.92 --> 5047.4400000000005
or maybe it's not even stuck to it maybe

5044.26 --> 5050.1990000000005
it is like braced

5047.44 --> 5051.699
yeah maybe it's literally not stuck to

5050.199 --> 5054.04
the non-space because there's literally

5051.699 --> 5056.08
nothing to stick to there

5054.04 --> 5059.199
but maybe it's like

5056.08 --> 5061.26
almost like an arc like it's just a a

5059.199 --> 5065.139999999999
big piece of ice that's literally

5061.26 --> 5066.38

5080.739 --> 5083.94
question steamy Traveler

5100.179 --> 5106.42
no I started but there is no Dome there

5104.679 --> 5109.62
is no dough

5106.42 --> 5109.62
what though

5112.3 --> 5115.14
like I

5117.94 --> 5122.139999999999
I don't know Stevie traveler I just

5120.159 --> 5125.62
don't know

5122.14 --> 5127.860000000001
I mean yeah if I say oh architectural

5125.62 --> 5130.719
pressure from the eyes keeping it there

5127.86 --> 5132.94
then like a dome type structure does

5130.719 --> 5134.9800000000005
typically come into play architecturally

5132.94 --> 5137.259999999999
I get it but that doesn't seem to be the

5134.98 --> 5140.199
case so I just don't know what the [ __ ]

5137.26 --> 5142.06

called up there I don't know I don't

5142.06 --> 5146.860000000001
know how it is called I don't know what

5144.04 --> 5149.679
is causing that cold but it is and it is

5146.86 --> 5151.54
definitely a critical factor in

5149.679 --> 5154.2390000000005
determining the gas pressure gradient

5151.54 --> 5157.3

5154.239 --> 5159.58
I'd like don't know

5157.3 --> 5161.860000000001
actually the more that I think about it

5159.58 --> 5163.6
now thanks to steamy Travelers question

5161.86 --> 5166.179
the more I come to the conclusion they

5163.6 --> 5167.92
have absolutely no idea how the hell

5166.179 --> 5171.179

5215.46 --> 5221.9800000000005
I've heard of that and Brian Brian's

5219.1 --> 5225.280000000001
logic is like as dull as

5221.98 --> 5229.0599999999995
dived upon that he thinks it's because

5225.28 --> 5231.46
that's the band where the sun is

5229.06 --> 5234.820000000001

5231.46 --> 5237.4
I don't think so it's weird though

5234.82 --> 5241.36
I mean it's effectively inexplicable

5237.4 --> 5245.08
there is weird temperature cold and heat

hell that is there

5254.679 --> 5259.36
I cannot explain it

5257.199 --> 5261.219
I mean the closest I could get is like

5259.36 --> 5263.86
oh yeah there's like some sort of a

5261.219 --> 5266.679
microwave or something that's just

5263.86 --> 5269.199
it's just there like oh it's maybe it's

5266.679 --> 5271.3
just on the same level of mystery as to

5269.199 --> 5272.919999999999
like why the [ __ ] are the celestials

5271.3 --> 5275.38
even here how the hell does that work

5272.92 --> 5277.78
what like how are these things here well

5275.38 --> 5281.26
maybe on the same mystery level there's

5277.78 --> 5283.0599999999995
like a holographic microwave that's just

5281.26 --> 5285.219
like yeah here's just heat it's coming

5283.06 --> 5287.02
from the other dimension and here's cold

5285.219 --> 5289.4800000000005
it's coming from the other dimension and

5287.02 --> 5291.34
you will never ever ever be able to

5289.48 --> 5292.659
pinpoint how that works where it's

5291.34 --> 5295.659000000001
coming from

5292.659 --> 5299.138999999999
you'll never ever know it could be that

5295.659 --> 5304.239
and which kind of sounds frustrating

5299.139 --> 5307.06
so I don't know I just don't know how

5304.239 --> 5310.299999999999
but yeah there is a temperature

5307.06 --> 5313.54
influence somehow

5310.3 --> 5317.46
Heat at ground level they call it

5313.54 --> 5319.719
geothermal heat and the sun of course

5317.46 --> 5321.4
exchanging the sunlight of being

5319.719 --> 5325.3
absorbed

5321.4 --> 5326.199
and up there cold and that would have to

5325.3 --> 5328.659000000001
be

5326.199 --> 5331.0
the cause of the gas pressure gradient

5328.659 --> 5332.379999999999
within the realm there's no other

5331.0 --> 5335.32
option

5332.38 --> 5337.96
to even think about why that's happening

5335.32 --> 5340.179
that has to be it now how those

5337.96 --> 5342.82
temperature influences are actually

5340.179 --> 5345.28
there yeah

5342.82 --> 5348.34
we will probably never find out I have

5345.28 --> 5350.44
no idea how and why this specific

5348.34 --> 5353.5
temperature influences are at these

5350.44 --> 5355.86
Heights I do not know there's all kinds

5353.5 --> 5358.659
of [ __ ] stories especially in

5355.86 --> 5361.599999999999
heliocentrics and they love it is you

5358.659 --> 5362.86
know how that goes but nobody actually

5361.6 --> 5366.9400000000005
knows

5362.86 --> 5370.12
I think I've never ever been able to

5366.94 --> 5372.759999999999
hear anybody out in my lifetime that

5370.12 --> 5375.239
gave me a satisfactory answer to as to

5372.76 --> 5375.2390000000005
why

5380.87 --> 5386.5
[Music]

5384.1 --> 5387.9400000000005
because or is it the effect well if it

5386.5 --> 5389.98
would be the effect then there would

5387.94 --> 5391.178999999999
have to be something causing it now

5389.98 --> 5393.28
wouldn't it

5391.179 --> 5395.9400000000005
the problem is we don't know what's

5393.28 --> 5395.94
causing it

5397.78 --> 5403.719
I don't know there's [ __ ] stories

5400.9 --> 5406.0599999999995
about what's supposedly causing it but

5403.719 --> 5409.08
I've never seen any that were actually

5406.06 --> 5409.080000000001
that held ground

5411.66 --> 5425.98
[Music]

5423.42 --> 5429.4800000000005
s let's not do that anyway I gotta take

5425.98 --> 5429.48
a two minute break I'll be right back

5429.58 --> 5432.239
foreign

5478.48 --> 5481.0199999999995
all right

5505.3 --> 5507.54
foreign

5517.78 --> 5521.139
oh by the way at least G I still wanted

5519.82 --> 5523.179
to ask

5521.139 --> 5525.76
because yesterday you said you had

5523.179 --> 5528.52
toothache and all that and I recommend

5525.76 --> 5530.7390000000005
that you get the magnesium

5528.52 --> 5531.330000000001
and you did have it you say so did it

5530.739 --> 5532.959999999999
work

5531.33 --> 5535.659
[Music]

5532.96 --> 5537.84
I mean if it didn't I'd still like to

5535.659 --> 5537.839999999999
know

5545.08 --> 5548.199
I hope it did

5546.52 --> 5550.3
[Music]

5548.199 --> 5553.178999999999
I mean you're not you don't seem to be

5550.3 --> 5557.08
complaining today so

5553.179 --> 5558.9400000000005
anyway sorry to pull you maybe back into

5557.08 --> 5562.679
thinking about it

5558.94 --> 5562.678999999999
but I kind of really wanted to know

5562.68 --> 5571.189
[Music]

5587.62 --> 5590.62
well

5620.62 --> 5625.0599999999995
I think Elise G is referencing the

5623.38 --> 5626.62
butterfly effect

5625.06 --> 5628.659000000001
it did

5626.62 --> 5633.659
it was exactly what you needed awesome

5628.659 --> 5633.659
like it has it like actually gone away

5633.94 --> 5638.62
like completely even

5636.52 --> 5643.0
because it's basically only like a

5638.62 --> 5644.62
symptom a symptom thing but if it just

5643.0 --> 5646.86
completely went away that's pretty

5644.62 --> 5646.86
awesome

5647.02 --> 5651.219
having tea instead of coffee today Ah

5649.179 --> 5653.8
that's very wise

5651.219 --> 5656.34
right wow but that's really cool that

5653.8 --> 5656.34
that worked

5656.98 --> 5662.799999999999
I mean what a discovery

5660.46 --> 5664.9
I also recommended it to Divergent Droid

5662.8 --> 5667.6
he seems to also have some issues

5664.9 --> 5670.179
currently

5667.6 --> 5672.34
so yeah that's definitely a trick I'm

5670.179 --> 5675.159
Gonna Keep in there

5672.34 --> 5678.400000000001
because I mean

5675.159 --> 5682.54
who needs freaking pain medication and

5678.4 --> 5685.54
[ __ ] anyway you can just use that

5682.54 --> 5685.54
anyway

5686.139 --> 5690.6990000000005
very happy that helped please carry on

5689.199 --> 5691.78
with the conversation it was really

5690.699 --> 5694.259999999999
interesting

5691.78 --> 5694.259999999999
I think

5708.639 --> 5713.56
you're interested in the butterfly

5710.679 --> 5717.06
effect it's not to be fair it's not

5713.56 --> 5717.06
super interesting it's kind of

5717.179 --> 5721.54
philosophical squirting if you ask me

5719.5 --> 5724.239
the butterfly effect is that anything

5721.54 --> 5726.88
can just completely

5724.239 --> 5730.36
it's basically saying like nothing is

5726.88 --> 5732.719
predictable because even a butterfly

5730.36 --> 5736.679
flapping its wings in a certain second

5732.719 --> 5739.42
can completely offset the entire

5736.679 --> 5742.6
predictability of everything because

5739.42 --> 5744.88
just the one fling flap Wing flapping in

5742.6 --> 5746.26
that one moment can just cause that and

5744.88 --> 5748.659000000001
that would cause that and that would

5746.26 --> 5750.52
change the entire world that's kind of

5748.659 --> 5752.5599999999995
the butterfly effect if I remember

5750.52 --> 5753.9400000000005
correctly and I always thought it was

5752.56 --> 5757.02
kind of silly

5753.94 --> 5757.0199999999995
as a concept

5757.78 --> 5763.12
it's it's basically saying like oh even

5760.659 --> 5767.219
the littlest of things can change the

5763.12 --> 5767.219
world that's basically what it is

5768.1 --> 5777.04
that's how I remember it anyway

5770.02 --> 5779.1990000000005
[Music]

5777.04 --> 5781.739
to sneeze or not to sneeze that's

5779.199 --> 5781.739
hilarious

5783.58 --> 5788.63
[Music]

5788.8 --> 5793.66
foreign

5790.45 --> 5793.66
[Music]

5794.219 --> 5799.2390000000005
went excellent yeah that's what it did

5797.139 --> 5801.46
for me too at the time

5799.239 --> 5803.4
it's so good for like the acute

5801.46 --> 5806.44
situations where it's like

5803.4 --> 5809.138999999999
then it's perfect

5806.44 --> 5810.159
so so glad that it actually worked I

5809.139 --> 5813.400000000001
mean

5810.159 --> 5816.299999999999
I'm basically still in the testing phase

5813.4 --> 5816.299999999999
of this because

5817.0 --> 5820.9
I don't even know where I got that

5819.4 --> 5823.9
information from

5820.9 --> 5826.239
I think I might have got it in a vision

5823.9 --> 5829.719
like a long time ago

5826.239 --> 5835.0199999999995
and then only recently remembered

5829.719 --> 5835.02
oh or PayPal oh okay thanks bjcina

5836.32 --> 5840.699
but yeah I'm basically still trying out

5839.26 --> 5843.280000000001
what happens

5840.699 --> 5845.379999999999
I because I I wasn't sure if it would

5843.28 --> 5847.659
only work for me or if it would work for

5845.38 --> 5850.02
others too but at least G says it works

5847.659 --> 5854.0199999999995
for him so that is

5850.02 --> 5854.02
that's interesting

5863.38 --> 5867.12
anyway checking PayPal

5889.44 --> 5892.62
thank you

5894.34 --> 5900.14
thank you for tipping

5896.94 --> 5900.139999999999

5900.46 --> 5904.86
hope you're doing well by the way

5902.139 --> 5904.86
financially

5906.94 --> 5911.138999999999
but yeah I appreciate

5909.58 --> 5913.42
tips

5911.139 --> 5916.42
I mean you could all throw it all in one

5913.42 --> 5918.52
go and like pile it on or you could

5916.42 --> 5920.8
basically just keep throwing tips on a

5918.52 --> 5922.900000000001
more regular basis either either way

5920.8 --> 5925.12
works thank you thank you for the

5922.9 --> 5929.5
donation PGC Nana thanks

5925.12 --> 5932.82
again fiber oats and drunken bullet

5929.5 --> 5932.82
also for donating

5935.26 --> 5940.3
wonder if if clove oil has any benefit

5937.84 --> 5942.219
of daily use in the mouth no no it

5940.3 --> 5945.0
doesn't fiber out

5942.219 --> 5945.0
it does not

5947.98 --> 5952.718999999999
look what it'll do actually you got to

5950.56 --> 5955.900000000001
realize this is that clove oil is like

5952.719 --> 5959.32
it is effectively in the categorized as

5955.9 --> 5961.599999999999
pain medication what does it do it numbs

5959.32 --> 5964.84
the nerves

5961.6 --> 5968.02
here's the thing yeah

5964.84 --> 5970.4800000000005
keep using it regularly

5968.02 --> 5974.5
you know what happens

5970.48 --> 5977.259999999999
your nerves get super oversensitive

5974.5 --> 5979.239
right eventually the suppressant will

5977.26 --> 5981.46
not work as well and then when you stop

5979.239 --> 5985.0199999999995
using it it's actually more sensitive

5981.46 --> 5986.8
than ever and even things like super

5985.02 --> 5990.820000000001
cold

5986.8 --> 5993.939
issues like cold water like sets It Off

5990.82 --> 5993.938999999999
[Music]

6031.34 --> 6035.06
hello hello yeah

6035.639 --> 6038.719
did you get that

6039.0 --> 6046.26
all that last thing I said is that

6042.96 --> 6049.02
yeah clove oil is just for

6046.26 --> 6051.96
instant pain relief but if you keep

6049.02 --> 6056.76
using it it'll give you issues back like

6051.96 --> 6059.1
typical pain suppressants and magnesium

6056.76 --> 6062.639
doesn't do that it really just like

6059.1 --> 6064.320000000001
solves the entire situation apparently

6062.639 --> 6068.76
and

6064.32 --> 6071.219
yeah doesn't get the same issue so I

6068.76 --> 6073.8
yeah I'd stay like I mean I like kind of

6071.219 --> 6075.78
clothes I like clove

6073.8 --> 6078.54
I even like I like putting a little

6075.78 --> 6081.12
clove powder in my cigarettes literally

6078.54 --> 6085.08
I literally if I'm not gonna smell

6081.12 --> 6087.599999999999
cannabis and I take a little

6085.08 --> 6090.239
clove powder and just put it in between

6087.6 --> 6092.400000000001
my cigarette very little bit because I

6090.239 --> 6095.218999999999
like the taste it's it's maybe sort of

6092.4 --> 6097.0199999999995
an Indonesian thing like cut deck

6095.219 --> 6099.2390000000005
correct deck

6097.02 --> 6100.8
but

6099.239 --> 6104.339999999999
yeah

6100.8 --> 6106.92
I'm not gonna constantly smoke that

6104.34 --> 6110.28
and I don't typically I don't use any

6106.92 --> 6113.78
kind of pain relief situation I just

6110.28 --> 6118.139
don't do that I face my pain usually but

6113.78 --> 6120.42
the Magnesium is like one of the few

6118.139 --> 6123.0
exceptions because it's just so basic

6120.42 --> 6125.52
and it's only good I mean there's

6123.0 --> 6127.699
literally no detriment to using that at

6125.52 --> 6127.6990000000005
all

6131.58 --> 6134.3
right

6152.179 --> 6158.6
okay at least G interesting that you say

6155.699 --> 6158.599999999999
that but yes

6159.96 --> 6164.639
you're technically correct

6162.54 --> 6167.9
that is a bit of a thing

6164.639 --> 6167.900000000001
in hot areas

6168.719 --> 6173.639
yeah the the asphalt will absorb a lot

6171.48 --> 6176.5199999999995
of heat and then cars moving over it

6173.639 --> 6179.34
will kind of spread it out

6176.52 --> 6181.02
although if a lot of cars like a lot of

6179.34 --> 6184.02
them are actually constantly driving

6181.02 --> 6184.860000000001
over it then it's just not gonna heat up

6184.02 --> 6191.96
that much

6184.86 --> 6195.0
[Music]

6191.96 --> 6199.9800000000005
just take it easy

6195.0 --> 6201.96
try to put all of the text in one in one

6199.98 --> 6204.0
comment please not don't spread them

6201.96 --> 6205.679
around like that's kind of annoying

6204.0 --> 6210.5
uh

6205.679 --> 6210.5
benefit the smoking clove no not really

6223.8 --> 6229.860000000001
no not nap well on the other hand what

6227.34 --> 6232.219
it does a little is well it gives a bit

6229.86 --> 6236.699
of the numbing stuff

6232.219 --> 6239.34
in well in your throat right so

6236.699 --> 6241.678999999999
if you're like one of those smokers that

6239.34 --> 6243.659000000001
just cannot stop smoking like no matter

6241.679 --> 6244.5
what because you'd like go nuts or

6243.659 --> 6246.719
something

6244.5 --> 6250.739
and you have like a sore throat well

6246.719 --> 6253.38
regular smoking usually makes that worse

6250.739 --> 6255.178999999999
well if you insist that you I have to

6253.38 --> 6257.76
smoke because otherwise I'm gonna kill

6255.179 --> 6260.159
myself or something then maybe clove

6257.76 --> 6262.1990000000005
cigarettes would like make it a little

6260.159 --> 6264.36
easier on the throat or something I I

6262.199 --> 6265.78
mean you can't really call that a

6264.36 --> 6268.0199999999995
benefit I mean

6265.78 --> 6271.4
[Music]

6268.02 --> 6271.400000000001
I mean yeah

6273.0 --> 6279.96
but what clove typically would be useful

6276.9 --> 6282.659
for in another context is well the same

6279.96 --> 6286.32
as it is like with black pepper

6282.659 --> 6290.759999999999
right typical pepper

6286.32 --> 6294.96
thingies right little round thingies

6290.76 --> 6298.820000000001
if you combine that with other stuff

6294.96 --> 6301.92
like with the black pepper with

6298.82 --> 6305.4
vitamins and minerals then it's actually

6301.92 --> 6308.4
proven so I hear I've never actually

6305.4 --> 6311.5199999999995
like checked it in a laboratory myself

6308.4 --> 6315.239
but so I hear that it helps the body

6311.52 --> 6317.280000000001
absorb the vitamins and minerals better

6315.239 --> 6320.58
well there could be

6317.28 --> 6322.739
like comparable types of benefits with

6320.58 --> 6325.32
clove somehow that if you combine it

6322.739 --> 6328.638999999999
with certain types of herbs that it kind

6325.32 --> 6332.759999999999
of like makes it more potent it could be

6328.639 --> 6335.1
I'm not a herbalist though like that but

6332.76 --> 6336.900000000001
I suspect that there might be because it

6335.1 --> 6338.6990000000005
is kind of that type of herb you know

6336.9 --> 6341.159
it's like this dried

6338.699 --> 6344.759999999999
super spicy thing it is like one of the

6341.159 --> 6347.94
old spices remember remember from

6344.76 --> 6349.619000000001
history lesson perhaps that like part of

6347.94 --> 6353.58
the reason for the east Indian trade

6349.619 --> 6355.199
company was to get clove

6353.58 --> 6357.86
pepper

6355.199 --> 6357.86
and coffee

6359.28 --> 6364.92
those were like very well known and very

6362.82 --> 6366.78
typically like yeah the cloves come from

6364.92 --> 6369.32
India

6366.78 --> 6369.32
right

6370.44 --> 6375.0
so

6371.94 --> 6376.099999999999
foreign it's got to be for more than

6375.0 --> 6377.699
just taste

6376.1 --> 6380.219
[Music]

6377.699 --> 6382.799999999999
so there might be like certain ways you

6380.219 --> 6385.08
can combine it but I do not know about

6382.8 --> 6387.6
it I know about it with black pepper I

6385.08 --> 6390.84
do not know like what to combine clove

6387.6 --> 6392.660000000001
with to give it some kind of a effect

6390.84 --> 6394.9800000000005
that's good I don't know

6392.66 --> 6397.08
[Music]

6394.98 --> 6399.73
you might find it out there

6397.08 --> 6411.439
I don't know about it

6399.73 --> 6411.438999999999
[Music]

6414.119 --> 6418.44
but yeah I don't know there's like

6415.98 --> 6421.98
certain typical meals in Dutch Dutch

6418.44 --> 6426.0599999999995
meals that do like use cloves

6421.98 --> 6428.638999999999
so like a certain type of cabbage meals

6426.06 --> 6432.179
then they put like typically put cloves

6428.639 --> 6434.76
like among the cabbage

6432.179 --> 6437.4
I don't know if that makes it healthier

6434.76 --> 6440.280000000001
or something but I did always kind of

6437.4 --> 6443.46
like it I mean I do kind of like the

6440.28 --> 6445.259999999999
taste of cloves in certain meals like if

6443.46 --> 6447.119
you combine it with apple and certain

6445.26 --> 6451.5
cabbages and then like kind of really

6447.119 --> 6451.5
works so yeah

6453.96 --> 6460.58
I mean it's yeah it's just like Cinema

6457.199 --> 6463.919999999999
cinnamon right cinnamon is not like oh

6460.58 --> 6466.44
oh so good for you although if you

6463.92 --> 6468.54
combine it like typical spice then yeah

6466.44 --> 6470.339999999999
you might get something out of it

6468.54 --> 6473.76
and I think that clove is just very

6470.34 --> 6476.219
similar to like cinnamon like that

6473.76 --> 6478.4800000000005
it's also one of those herbs

6476.219 --> 6481.02
that were typically traded

lot

6611.58 --> 6617.5199999999995

typical spices well will always be

6684.239 --> 6688.138999999999
of all kinds of spices I mean we

6686.699 --> 6690.96
traditionally traded them a lot but

6688.139 --> 6693.2390000000005
there were like a few and these are like

6690.96 --> 6695.159
the ones that I remember

6693.239 --> 6697.98
but the Dutch cooking has never been

6695.159 --> 6699.78
like all about the spiciness at all it's

6697.98 --> 6703.5599999999995
always been kind of basic really it's

6699.78 --> 6707.5199999999995
just like potatoes vegetables

6703.56 --> 6711.659000000001
a piece of meat of some kind

6707.52 --> 6715.5
and then gravy

6715.5 --> 6719.1

6716.52 --> 6720.96
cinnamon or something

6719.1 --> 6723.3

6720.96 --> 6725.28
elaborate really Dutch cooking has

6723.3 --> 6728.0

in Dutch it's note Muscat

7316.94 --> 7323.9
and also of course I'm happy

7319.94 --> 7326.839999999999
to finally have a good book

7323.9 --> 7328.5199999999995
now I have to freaking read it that's

7326.84 --> 7331.58
the downside

7328.52 --> 7336.139
I don't typically like reading and I'm

7331.58 --> 7338.239
being very bracing against it and like I

7336.139 --> 7340.28
want to read it yeah but you gotta read

7338.239 --> 7342.5599999999995
it Arwin damn it you bought the book to

7340.28 --> 7343.759999999999
read not to be complaining about it and

7342.56 --> 7347.1990000000005
not read it

7343.76 --> 7347.1990000000005
so I gotta read it

7348.02 --> 7351.5
I know it's a good book it would have to

7350.179 --> 7353.179
be

7351.5 --> 7355.76
otherwise I wouldn't even have ordered

7353.179 --> 7360.4400000000005

7361.88 --> 7364.719
