136.08 --> 141.0
right

138.599 --> 144.599
the weather

141.0 --> 147.239
is yeah very similar to yesterday it's

144.599 --> 149.57999999999998
just kind of rainy but it hasn't really

147.239 --> 154.08
been raining continually

149.58 --> 157.37900000000002
but it is just kind of gray windy

154.08 --> 159.959
like that's the big difference between

157.379 --> 161.76
when it was Frosty and when and now is

159.959 --> 163.56
that now there's actual wind blowing

161.76 --> 166.94
during that whole Frost period it was

163.56 --> 166.94
just no wind at all

167.28 --> 171.599
it probably would have Frozen even

169.319 --> 173.57999999999998
harder if there was

171.599 --> 175.26
but uh yeah there's some wind and

173.58 --> 177.739
especially during the night it was kind

175.26 --> 177.739
of restless

179.64 --> 184.379
because it was a little bit of storm

182.819 --> 186.72
a little bit

184.379 --> 188.819
right but yeah

186.72 --> 191.04
I tried to wipe the droplets off the

188.819 --> 194.04
window here so the webcam could look

191.04 --> 195.72
through it better but it just dropped

194.04 --> 197.819
lid up back

195.72 --> 199.62
it droppled

197.819 --> 202.92
is that even a word

199.62 --> 206.23000000000002
it just got droplet covered

202.92 --> 207.89999999999998
pretty much within 15 minutes again

206.23 --> 210.379
[Music]

207.9 --> 210.37900000000002
right

212.7 --> 217.51899999999998
it looks bad outside nah it's not that

215.28 --> 217.519
bad

218.879 --> 224.06
I mean it's kind of nice that it's not

221.04 --> 229.2
that cold anymore I mean my

224.06 --> 232.379
my spine is certainly appreciating it

229.2 --> 234.78
and like my yeah my hands because I

232.379 --> 235.44
really had issues with that cold it was

234.78 --> 236.64000000000001
very annoying

235.44 --> 239.519
[Music]

236.64 --> 242.29899999999998
I don't like freezing

239.519 --> 242.299
never have

246.659 --> 252.78
right even as a kid I'd have to like

248.94 --> 255.35999999999999
really cover up and my mother to my

252.78 --> 256.919
mother had even worse issues with Cole

255.36 --> 260.579
as me

256.919 --> 264.53999999999996
but like I would be packed like

260.579 --> 266.46000000000004
t-shirt thick sweater and thick jacket

264.54 --> 270.36
and gloves and

266.46 --> 272.69899999999996
pad and moon boots right super thick

270.36 --> 274.74
warm because that's the only way I would

272.699 --> 275.759
find it bearable outside when it was

274.74 --> 279.32
freezing

275.759 --> 279.32
wouldn't even have to be that cold

279.84 --> 282.73999999999995
all right anyway

283.44 --> 290.34
not a big fan of continual rain either

286.32 --> 293.52
but then again I am Dutch so and the

290.34 --> 296.34
Dutch can handle rain like better than

293.52 --> 298.19899999999996
a lot of people even though we hate it

296.34 --> 300.479
but we can't handle it it's kind of like

298.199 --> 303.02000000000004
the British I think

300.479 --> 303.02
uh

303.24 --> 309.8
anyway hello Supreme knowing first in

305.82 --> 309.8
chat good to see you how are you doing

310.979 --> 314.88
I would like to wait I'll get an

313.139 --> 318.02
umbrella then

314.88 --> 318.02
I mean it's very easy

320.639 --> 326.16
unless it's like storming hard or

323.94 --> 330.24
something then yeah it doesn't really

326.16 --> 333.24
help that much it's more of a hassle

330.24 --> 333.24
foreign

333.5 --> 337.38
but

335.4 --> 341.29999999999995
I'll be fine

337.38 --> 341.3
my back is doing so much better

343.02 --> 348.18
I'm pretty much fully flexible again

345.9 --> 349.56
with only just

348.18 --> 352.62
a few

349.56 --> 355.62
muscles that do kind of get sore if I

352.62 --> 358.32
like sit too long in in a certain

355.62 --> 360.62
way or whatever but overall it's doing

358.32 --> 360.62
great

361.94 --> 366.5
almost completely recovered

369.36 --> 375.18
right so yesterday

372.479 --> 378.24
well early bird show was pretty damn

375.18 --> 380.16
good even though we got a bit dark

378.24 --> 383.09000000000003
subject

380.16 --> 386.14000000000004
I didn't watch it back though just

383.09 --> 386.14
[Music]

386.28 --> 392.039
but got it caught people's attention

388.919 --> 394.139
just I don't know there's just weird

392.039 --> 396.56
things happening with YouTube man it's

394.139 --> 396.56
weird

398.16 --> 402.96000000000004
so I did get like a response

401.52 --> 406.4
from the

402.96 --> 406.4
YouTube email

406.62 --> 410.639
back and forth

408.419 --> 413.52
about like hey could you please not give

410.639 --> 415.44
me a double speak answers and so I got a

413.52 --> 418.44
more clear answer

415.44 --> 420.84
and they actually told me that they were

418.44 --> 423.68
going to restore the video but that it

420.84 --> 423.67999999999995
might take some time

428.9 --> 435.0
I could sense how important it is for

432.66 --> 437.28000000000003
you in getting the video restored so I

435.0 --> 439.919
reached out to our policy team to check

437.28 --> 443.88
on your video once again and it may take

439.919 --> 445.62
a few days to hear back from them

443.88 --> 449.3
um

445.62 --> 449.3
okay that's not exactly

449.759 --> 455.28000000000003
yeah it might just be a stalling tactic

452.94 --> 457.16
as well

455.28 --> 460.38
but at least

457.16 --> 463.5
they understand my urgency but it's all

460.38 --> 465.96
right dude I wonder if like if these

463.5 --> 467.6
people are actual people or if they're

465.96 --> 469.5
Bots

467.6 --> 472.03900000000004
[Music]

469.5 --> 472.039
foreign

476.419 --> 483.29999999999995
thousands and thousands of messages

480.259 --> 484.86
ranging from completely insane gamma as

483.3 --> 487.319
to

484.86 --> 489.599
like pretty important people and and

487.319 --> 492.139
they just rush it they're gonna be it

489.599 --> 492.139
too but

493.259 --> 497.36
anyway that happened

500.759 --> 508.44
right and of course the Flat Earth

502.379 --> 511.02000000000004
debates dude that was one long ass show

508.44 --> 513.24
because Bev got on no everybody knows

511.02 --> 517.14
that by now I think because Nathan

513.24 --> 520.74
premiered that event like later that

517.14 --> 523.08
evening like he immediately premiered it

520.74 --> 526.14
probably

523.08 --> 527.88
because he thinks and is not unlikely

526.14 --> 529.98
that BEP was gonna try to do something

527.88 --> 532.2
with it

529.98 --> 534.4200000000001
and basically

532.2 --> 536.899
take all the glory even if just as a

534.42 --> 536.899
punching bag

537.54 --> 542.399
I don't know but yeah

539.779 --> 545.399
Members Only video came out and the

542.399 --> 547.8
premiere last night so Bev got like a

545.399 --> 551.899
super hard grilling and he deserved it

547.8 --> 551.899
he absolutely deserved it

554.519 --> 560.519
I mean the guy

557.22 --> 562.86
I have I'm an empath I pick up on these

560.519 --> 565.8
things and yeah Nathan went pretty hard

562.86 --> 568.98
sometimes it was like okay

565.8 --> 573.8599999999999
a bit dramatic there but

568.98 --> 573.86
all in support of a singular point

574.2 --> 580.74
and that's that he just doesn't know how

576.779 --> 583.26
to apologize maybe he does but he he's

580.74 --> 586.08
like decided like he's some kind of

583.26 --> 588.3
deity or something that never ever has

586.08 --> 592.5
to apologize he's decided that through

588.3 --> 594.779
his ego I know it is that I know it is

592.5 --> 597.42
because it's not the first time I've

594.779 --> 601.4399999999999
seen this sort of thing

597.42 --> 603.8
it's not a unique trait of a person to

601.44 --> 603.8000000000001
do that

604.08 --> 608.0400000000001
but it's horrific I mean those people

606.6 --> 610.8000000000001
are horrific

608.04 --> 614.459
people that never own up to their

610.8 --> 617.6999999999999
mistakes are horrific they are very

614.459 --> 619.68
blatantly demon-possessed and when it

617.7 --> 622.1
gets that bad those demons just never

619.68 --> 622.0999999999999
leave

624.3 --> 629.76
and I know that I've been pushing even

626.82 --> 631.8000000000001
during that show like hey bab you need

629.76 --> 634.56
to do this you need to

631.8 --> 635.88
if you want to be recognized as a normal

634.56 --> 638.459
person

635.88 --> 640.32
that can actually have conversations you

638.459 --> 642.54
need to be able to do that

640.32 --> 644.7
but when I left out

642.54 --> 647.88
because it was just not the right timing

644.7 --> 651.6
for it with Nathan getting so hard

647.88 --> 653.899
over it is that I do realize that if Bev

651.6 --> 656.94
would ever do that it would be

653.899 --> 659.88
murderously painful to him

656.94 --> 661.3800000000001
because of that demon holding him back

659.88 --> 663.42
right

661.38 --> 665.399
he can take it all

663.42 --> 668.579
because of

665.399 --> 671.82
that effect in him but if he lets that

668.579 --> 673.92
go then it's it was all for nothing and

671.82 --> 675.4200000000001
then basically a lot of the glory that

673.92 --> 677.6999999999999
he uses

675.42 --> 679.079
from believing that he doesn't have to

677.7 --> 681.0600000000001
apologize

679.079 --> 684.06
and that he technically could always

681.06 --> 686.399
argue to be right somehow

684.06 --> 688.079
that kind of like gives him a really

686.399 --> 689.519
great feeling

688.079 --> 690.8389999999999
otherwise he wouldn't be doing it

689.519 --> 694.14
continually

690.839 --> 697.2
and he's used to using that energy in

694.14 --> 700.68
doing things so if he now stops he would

697.2 --> 703.98
have to completely rewrite himself

700.68 --> 707.519
and he would feel extremely vulnerable

703.98 --> 708.9590000000001
and humiliated a lot naturally even if

707.519 --> 712.88
people wouldn't

708.959 --> 712.88
make fun of them or something about it

713.1 --> 717.0
it would be a complete personal

714.66 --> 718.38
transformation and those are extremely

717.0 --> 720.839
painful

718.38 --> 723.36
so I wasn't expecting Beth to like do it

720.839 --> 726.12
right there but like

723.36 --> 728.64
anywhere afterward

726.12 --> 729.42
in solitude like on this stream or

728.64 --> 732.12
something

729.42 --> 737.16
I mean it's no point doing it to no one

732.12 --> 740.04
because it is about his image

737.16 --> 744.48
I used to call that early on in my life

740.04 --> 746.2199999999999
the image with other people

744.48 --> 748.86
right

746.22 --> 751.2
so who knows what Bev is doing like

748.86 --> 753.98
outside of live streaming he might be

751.2 --> 756.5400000000001
like oh I know I was wrong I just

753.98 --> 758.279
like screaming and frustration in

756.54 --> 759.5999999999999
yourself and he's like yeah I know I'm

758.279 --> 761.7
wrong

759.6 --> 764.5400000000001
I'm not gonna tell you you don't deserve

761.7 --> 764.5400000000001
it or something right

765.06 --> 771.1199999999999
but he's just never said I am wrong I

768.899 --> 773.7
was wrong about this when somebody

771.12 --> 776.519
confronts him with an error that he made

773.7 --> 778.2
he never does that I've never ever heard

776.519 --> 781.62
him do that

778.2 --> 784.62
and not that I followed like hundreds of

781.62 --> 785.88
hours of his work it's just that I can't

784.62 --> 789.86
tell

785.88 --> 789.86
I can tell he's never done that

791.639 --> 797.04
I bet his parents had a very hard time

794.76 --> 799.139
with him

797.04 --> 801.74
maybe still do

799.139 --> 804.48
because that is

801.74 --> 806.5790000000001
excruciating to figure out that your

804.48 --> 809.399
child is like mentally blocked and

806.579 --> 810.66
literally cannot apologize because they

809.399 --> 812.76
will be treated

810.66 --> 816.48
like a deranged person

812.76 --> 818.7
like an anti-social deranged person and

816.48 --> 821.24
that is technically what you are when

818.7 --> 821.24
you do that

821.82 --> 827.339
because apologies

824.279 --> 830.279
for real things are necessary

827.339 --> 833.82
the necessary part of interaction social

830.279 --> 837.54
interaction of the energy Dynamics

833.82 --> 840.72
if you don't abide by it if you break

837.54 --> 843.0
that code you become like a spiritual

840.72 --> 848.0
vampire you start sucking on the people

843.0 --> 848.0
that will have to tolerate it see

851.839 --> 860.8800000000001
and then if you can tolerate that

855.779 --> 863.399
then yeah it will be very nice to you

860.88 --> 865.68
and that might be like oh but Dev is

863.399 --> 867.12
actually really nice once you get to

865.68 --> 871.38
know him

867.12 --> 873.68
dot dot and never ever call him out on a

871.38 --> 873.68
mistake

875.7 --> 880.1
they don't say that part but they know

881.399 --> 884.779
know intuitively

885.12 --> 891.12
ah

886.8 --> 896.04
hey LSG Neil Constantino good to see you

891.12 --> 899.519
yeah some [ __ ] with that it was brutal

896.04 --> 902.24
I mean bab is such a [ __ ] ass white I

899.519 --> 902.24
mean he is

902.94 --> 910.139
he is like Beavis and Butthead

905.699 --> 912.5999999999999
he's that stupid and that's stubborn

910.139 --> 915.3
I mean he is that stupid I mean he's

912.6 --> 917.22
more eloquently spoken than Beavis and

915.3 --> 921.4799999999999
Butthead which are literally bumbling

917.22 --> 923.279
buffoons but he is that stupid

921.48 --> 925.9200000000001
it's like

923.279 --> 927.72
his way with speech

925.92 --> 930.06
almost

927.72 --> 931.9200000000001
makes you not believe that he is

930.06 --> 934.56
actually that stupid because people that

931.92 --> 936.4799999999999
are that stupid usually also are what

934.56 --> 939.0
kind of bumbling buffoons they are not

936.48 --> 941.82
that eloquently spoken

939.0 --> 944.279
but that's an intuitive thing but he is

941.82 --> 949.0400000000001
relatively well spoken but he is a

944.279 --> 949.04
freaking [ __ ] like a really bad

949.079 --> 954.959
he has just sparing insights that are

952.56 --> 957.5999999999999
just like outside of every

954.959 --> 959.6389999999999
everything that everybody's doing

957.6 --> 962.48
he's just

959.639 --> 965.94
basically continually trying to escape

962.48 --> 968.519
is just a Perpetual escape artist mental

965.94 --> 971.1
escape artist he's always trying to find

968.519 --> 973.139
little things that

971.1 --> 974.639
that are not what other people are

973.139 --> 977.1
talking about

974.639 --> 979.5600000000001
and then over emphasizing that and then

977.1 --> 981.839
trying to exclude everything else saying

979.56 --> 984.2399999999999
like no all that is all [ __ ] no it's

981.839 --> 986.82
just this little stupid little thing

984.24 --> 990.66
and it does that continually

986.82 --> 993.1800000000001
it's really [ __ ] annoying

990.66 --> 996.779
I mean I like to find

993.18 --> 999.4799999999999
unique Little Gems here and there

996.779 --> 1002.42
and I will be very proud of it when I do

999.48 --> 1006.38
but when I find that gem I'm not going

1002.42 --> 1008.24
to be oh see I have the key now this is

1006.38 --> 1012.079
the only thing that's important and all

1008.24 --> 1015.0790000000001
that other [ __ ] is all nonsense now

1012.079 --> 1015.079
no

1016.279 --> 1021.92
no I don't do that

1018.8 --> 1022.7199999999999
because I'm not an egotistical [ __ ]

1021.92 --> 1024.74
like Bev

1022.72 --> 1027.26
[Music]

1024.74 --> 1029.66
who does that continually

1027.26 --> 1032.24
every time he does something he finds

1029.66 --> 1035.24
something he follows that up with trying

1032.24 --> 1036.86
to break down logical things that other

1035.24 --> 1040.339
people have done

1036.86 --> 1042.62
he continually does it com like

1040.339 --> 1045.5
compulsively

1042.62 --> 1048.6989999999998
I hate that I can't stand that guy I

1045.5 --> 1048.699
just cannot stand him

1048.96 --> 1052.559
[Music]

1057.26 --> 1060.82
hello Captain Caveman

1061.58 --> 1067.76
glad you told him to just humble himself

1064.94 --> 1070.039
right because that is that that was the

1067.76 --> 1074.74
main issue that was really the only

1070.039 --> 1074.74
issue there was no technical debate

1074.9 --> 1078.26
at all

1076.28 --> 1080.0
I mean Beth did not have an argument it

1078.26 --> 1081.62
was about the humility and I just

1080.0 --> 1084.32
realized that early on I thought okay

1081.62 --> 1086.7199999999998
I'll throw that in there quick

1084.32 --> 1089.799
so that at least

1086.72 --> 1092.96
he he can't like get too comfortable

1089.799 --> 1094.52
with distracting himself during the

1092.96 --> 1097.22
conversation with what the conversation

1094.52 --> 1100.52
is actually supposed to be about

1097.22 --> 1103.3600000000001
so immediately throw in the main point

1100.52 --> 1103.36
early on

1104.96 --> 1110.559
right but I knew that he wasn't actually

1107.72 --> 1110.559
going to do it

1111.98 --> 1118.76
I mean I like to admit to mistakes but

1115.94 --> 1121.52
even like when I would face Nathan

1118.76 --> 1123.86
acting like that now that doesn't really

1121.52 --> 1125.799
happen of course because we got an

1123.86 --> 1128.12
understanding

1125.799 --> 1129.98
yeah collegial

1128.12 --> 1132.7399999999998
understanding

1129.98 --> 1134.96
we're friends basically but yeah also

1132.74 --> 1138.02
business partner type friends

1134.96 --> 1139.64
so he wouldn't do that he knows they'll

1138.02 --> 1143.12
yeah not

1139.64 --> 1145.5200000000002
help and he doesn't need to do that

1143.12 --> 1147.86
because I'm sharp I don't make those

1145.52 --> 1150.1399999999999
types of mistakes

1147.86 --> 1154.8999999999999
and when I do I immediately own up to

1150.14 --> 1154.9
them once I am become aware of it

1155.059 --> 1159.86
I

1157.22 --> 1162.98
but when you face Nathan when he's that

1159.86 --> 1165.3799999999999
hard even if you're typically very easy

1162.98 --> 1168.0
going it's going to be very tough to

1165.38 --> 1169.16
actually then not brace against it

1168.0 --> 1171.86
[Music]

1169.16 --> 1173.299
and get angry like who the hell who the

1171.86 --> 1175.4599999999998
hell you think you're talking to right

1173.299 --> 1179.179
but he wasn't doing that

1175.46 --> 1181.94
Bev when other people get angry Beth has

1179.179 --> 1184.52
a little vampire in him who thinks he's

1181.94 --> 1186.14
a psychologist because he recognizes

1184.52 --> 1188.179
certain behaviors

1186.14 --> 1190.76
that he doesn't cognitively actively

1188.179 --> 1193.76
knows what to do with it at all doesn't

1190.76 --> 1196.4
have any tools like me I got thousands

1193.76 --> 1198.62
and thousands of tools to deal with

1196.4 --> 1201.26
psychological situations and you know

1198.62 --> 1203.4189999999999
that because I share that continually

1201.26 --> 1206.08
on my show

1203.419 --> 1209.1200000000001
right Beth does not

1206.08 --> 1211.58
poor stupid tricks

1209.12 --> 1216.02
they're very superficial not very

1211.58 --> 1217.28
memorable on average but

1216.02 --> 1220.52
even

1217.28 --> 1223.34
I would when Nathan goes on like that I

1220.52 --> 1224.9
would not want to apologize oh no wait

1223.34 --> 1226.82
now I lost my train of thought uh yeah

1224.9 --> 1228.799
Bev what he does he

1226.82 --> 1230.2
he recognizes when somebody else is

1228.799 --> 1233.48
angry

1230.2 --> 1235.94
that he is being alert out to become

1233.48 --> 1238.34
angry to basically show who he really is

1235.94 --> 1240.74
and not like oh geez he's an angry

1238.34 --> 1242.48
bitter man but to because when you're

1240.74 --> 1245.539
angry when you're lure it out when you

1242.48 --> 1247.1
get angry you want to say exactly what's

1245.539 --> 1249.2
on your mind because that's where your

1247.1 --> 1251.78
strength is that you need to hold on to

1249.2 --> 1254.78
in the situation yeah this is pure

1251.78 --> 1256.94
mechanical logic he knows that and he

1254.78 --> 1259.58
holds back and then he feels all smug

1256.94 --> 1262.16
and smart for being the calm one and

1259.58 --> 1263.6
then he imagines himself to be a

1262.16 --> 1264.74
psychologist

1263.6 --> 1267.02
right

1264.74 --> 1269.36
with the smoking pipe and the wool socks

1267.02 --> 1271.82
and all that sitting in his chair while

1269.36 --> 1274.4599999999998
the the other person getting super

1271.82 --> 1276.6789999999999
Furious is lying on the couch being his

1274.46 --> 1279.26
patient and rambling on super angry

1276.679 --> 1281.539
that's what he believes in those moments

1279.26 --> 1285.08
it's the little magic trick that he

1281.539 --> 1288.919
pulls on himself to avoid the situation

1285.08 --> 1290.299
to avoid confrontation right he's not

1288.919 --> 1292.159
the only one that does that there's

1290.299 --> 1295.039
another person that was very good at

1292.159 --> 1299.24
doing that it's called the rumpus

1295.039 --> 1303.46
and this is where the analogy this is

1299.24 --> 1303.46
where my gem comes that I found

1303.679 --> 1313.76
Bev and rumpus are extremely similar

1309.26 --> 1317.12
in a lot of ways but they also extremely

1313.76 --> 1319.34
contrast in other ways because rumpus is

1317.12 --> 1322.4599999999998
extremely smart he is

1319.34 --> 1326.299
also very devious but he's very sharp

1322.46 --> 1330.26
and very talented mathematically and

1326.299 --> 1332.0
even in presentation and all that right

1330.26 --> 1335.48
but he is

1332.0 --> 1336.26
kind of vulnerable he is sensitive in a

1335.48 --> 1338.1200000000001
way

1336.26 --> 1340.34
is weird

1338.12 --> 1342.08
yeah I don't know I kind of like rumpus

1340.34 --> 1345.86
but Bev

1342.08 --> 1349.039
does the same things he uses rumpus

1345.86 --> 1351.26
tactics continually and like cycle

1349.039 --> 1353.179
because rumpus does that too like he

1351.26 --> 1355.34
picks up on like oh you're trying to

1353.179 --> 1357.98
make me angry or you're trying to get me

1355.34 --> 1360.1999999999998
off guard so I'm just gonna follow

1357.98 --> 1362.539
another response but he does get easily

1360.2 --> 1365.799
Charged Up So eventually you can squeeze

1362.539 --> 1365.799
rumpus and then he will go

1365.86 --> 1370.6999999999998
right he will go on tilts Bev does not

1369.26 --> 1373.34
go until ever

1370.7 --> 1375.32
but he is [ __ ] thick as [ __ ] he

1373.34 --> 1377.6589999999999
doesn't know anything and he's an

1375.32 --> 1379.46
arrogant piece of [ __ ] like way worse

1377.659 --> 1382.24
than rumpus rumpus can actually

1379.46 --> 1382.24
apologize

1383.059 --> 1389.78
he knows how to apologize usually for a

1386.84 --> 1392.12
side point just to Virtue signal that he

1389.78 --> 1394.94
can and seem a little bit more

1392.12 --> 1398.1789999999999
respectable as he then proceeds to keep

1394.94 --> 1401.0
denying the issue at hand right it's a

1398.179 --> 1404.179
tactical a very tactical guy

1401.0 --> 1406.76
but they are so similar in how they act

1404.179 --> 1408.2
like

1406.76 --> 1411.26
it's just

1408.2 --> 1413.24
it's so weird they're counter opposite

1411.26 --> 1416.559
in ways but also it's just like there's

1413.24 --> 1416.559
this weird symmetry

1416.72 --> 1421.76
between who rumpuses and what he does

1418.94 --> 1425.1200000000001
and what Bev does

1421.76 --> 1428.299
so it's almost like Bev is the

1425.12 --> 1432.3999999999999
flat earther in denial rhombus

1428.299 --> 1432.4
and rumpus is the baller rumpus

1432.5 --> 1438.32
yeah I got I just got that

1435.5 --> 1440.659
Vibe yesterday

1438.32 --> 1442.28
I don't know maybe you guys are not

1440.659 --> 1443.72
following maybe you think like what the

1442.28 --> 1445.82
hell are you talking about Arwin I don't

1443.72 --> 1447.679
know but just to me the similarities

1445.82 --> 1449.299
just really stand out

1447.679 --> 1451.1000000000001
even though they're such an extreme

1449.299 --> 1453.9189999999999
contrast but it's almost like they're so

1451.1 --> 1456.6399999999999
contrasted it's symmetrical again

1453.919 --> 1456.64
between them

1458.179 --> 1463.48
but they're both so locked into their

1460.82 --> 1463.48
own little world

1463.65 --> 1470.24
[Music]

1467.539 --> 1472.58
right and rumpus thinks he's like this

1470.24 --> 1474.1
engineering genius and beb thinks he's

1472.58 --> 1476.78
like this

1474.1 --> 1481.1789999999999
wise psychology

1476.78 --> 1481.1789999999999
but neither of them are those things

1481.26 --> 1485.46
[Music]

1487.59 --> 1492.6789999999999
[Music]

1490.7 --> 1493.94
Nathan has done nothing but shout him

1492.679 --> 1496.94
out and praise

1493.94 --> 1498.0800000000002
well Nathan's been very tolerant towards

1496.94 --> 1501.26
Emil

1498.08 --> 1503.6589999999999
that's how you should see it

1501.26 --> 1507.98
he's not praising

1503.659 --> 1510.38
Bev he's just he's been recognizing that

1507.98 --> 1513.8600000000001
he does have some subtle skills here and

1510.38 --> 1516.5
there it's just I don't give a [ __ ]

1513.86 --> 1518.4189999999999
it's boring as [ __ ] to me

1516.5 --> 1520.4
and like I cannot stand the guy it's

1518.419 --> 1523.3600000000001
just

1520.4 --> 1523.3600000000001
I can't stand him

1524.36 --> 1532.24
then apparently Nathan could stand in

1529.039 --> 1532.24
for some reason before

1538.039 --> 1542.179
right

1539.0 --> 1544.88
but yeah I can't it's just the package

1542.179 --> 1548.0
of typical attitude and behavior

1544.88 --> 1551.6000000000001
always comes by when you just watch him

1548.0 --> 1554.98
or so listen to him it's intolerable

1551.6 --> 1554.98
I mean that's the [ __ ]

1556.76 --> 1562.46
that was out that yeah a lot of people

1559.4 --> 1564.0800000000002
were acting like that even in 2015 in

1562.46 --> 1566.6000000000001
ways

1564.08 --> 1568.3999999999999
just a lack of dynamic

1566.6 --> 1571.1589999999999
like they're not dynamic they don't

1568.4 --> 1574.539
spiritually evolve a lot

1571.159 --> 1577.0390000000002
and that's what I loved about well

1574.539 --> 1580.4
Nathan and the Flat Earth of H project

1577.039 --> 1583.76
because that finally brought a change to

1580.4 --> 1585.5590000000002
that it re that was really a change in

1583.76 --> 1586.64
the landscape in how things could be

1585.559 --> 1588.5
done

1586.64 --> 1590.539
where there was an actual debate where

1588.5 --> 1592.279
things could technically be figured out

1590.539 --> 1594.799
and there would be smart people and they

1592.279 --> 1596.84
would not just do it in the moment and

1594.799 --> 1599.299
then forget about it but actually

1596.84 --> 1602.6589999999999
everybody would keep track

1599.299 --> 1605.27
like a think tank a development

1602.659 --> 1606.8600000000001
Center on the internet

1605.27 --> 1610.4189999999999
[Music]

1606.86 --> 1610.4189999999999
such a big change there was

1610.52 --> 1615.3799999999999
but yeah what Bev does it reminds me of

1612.799 --> 1617.799
that [ __ ] back then it's just the same

1615.38 --> 1617.7990000000002
[ __ ]

1618.559 --> 1624.1399999999999
I mean it's not much different from what

1621.86 --> 1626.539
anti-flater authors do really

1624.14 --> 1630.26
right regurgitate the same [ __ ]

1626.539 --> 1632.799
arguments from 2015. well Bev is acting

1630.26 --> 1632.799
like that

1635.539 --> 1643.279
he's just not a baller

1639.679 --> 1647.0
but he refused I mean what the [ __ ] did

1643.279 --> 1649.34
he refuses to call it flatter what the

1647.0 --> 1651.08
[ __ ] is wrong with you are you [ __ ]

1649.34 --> 1653.84
[ __ ]

1651.08 --> 1655.8799999999999
or are you just like this sniveling

1653.84 --> 1658.1
coward

1655.88 --> 1660.679
that's like excited by something that's

1658.1 --> 1663.74
apparently really interesting and

1660.679 --> 1667.46
Powerful in some way yet you refuse to

1663.74 --> 1671.36
name it like a cowardly [ __ ]

mental problems or obstacles or

1723.039 --> 1727.48
technicalities he doesn't fix anything

1732.02 --> 1737.12
bunch of Engineers and Architects built

1734.299 --> 1739.4

Architects incompetent enough to

1753.32 --> 1760.12
overlook that like that's what he does

1755.779 --> 1760.12

1837.5 --> 1843.399
gonna put him in the title no he doesn't

1840.679 --> 1843.3990000000001

1859.34 --> 1862.9399999999998
right

1860.299 --> 1864.679
just like given my opinion about some

1862.94 --> 1867.22
movie that I watched

right

1869.899 --> 1875.059
I mean I watch movies that have like

1872.6 --> 1878.299
really disgusting [ __ ] in it but if it's

1875.059 --> 1881.62
interesting about something in some way

1878.299 --> 1881.62
then I'll talk about it

1881.899 --> 1886.9399999999998
right doesn't mean that I love those

1883.88 --> 1888.5590000000002
movies and I'm gonna continually promote

1886.94 --> 1891.0800000000002
them or something

1888.559 --> 1891.98
or even put them in the title

1891.08 --> 1904.6399999999999
anyway

1891.98 --> 1904.64
[Music]

1910.22 --> 1917.299

Brenda on his show

1925.11 --> 1928.32
[Music]

1930.38 --> 1935.14
that that literally made me feel a

1933.559 --> 1937.8799999999999
little bit more sick

1935.14 --> 1940.1000000000001
hearing that

1937.88 --> 1943.0

1940.1 --> 1946.1999999999998
that bad wow

1959.899 --> 1962.62
I mean

1962.84 --> 1965.62
you know

1966.98 --> 1972.919
I bet the next time I bump into sleeping

1969.2 --> 1975.7
worry he will probably also say that

1972.919 --> 1975.7
foreign

1985.88 --> 1991.279
not even three minutes and 33 seconds

1989.24 --> 1993.74
all right

1991.279 --> 1997.519
yeah well that that's usually the time

1993.74 --> 1999.559
span that I listened to Bev streams

1997.519 --> 2001.48
because

1999.559 --> 2004.32
after that I'm like

2001.48 --> 2004.32
no

2005.14 --> 2007.679
foreign

2010.779 --> 2013.47

[Music]

2019.72 --> 2024.6000000000001

2022.299 --> 2027.1589999999999
yesterday

2024.6 --> 2028.7199999999998
it has streamed it's kind of weirdly

2027.159 --> 2029.98
divided

2028.72 --> 2032.34
where is it

2029.98 --> 2032.34
what

2032.82 --> 2037.08
yeah refracted philosophy

2038.08 --> 2043.24
shout out to lva Paul

2040.48 --> 2044.5
but if they had to fight the Flat Earth

2043.24 --> 2047.14
on

2044.5 --> 2048.82
like in Gilbert or Discord whatever they

2047.14 --> 2051.54
use

2048.82 --> 2054.5800000000004
and that was freaking hysterical man

2051.54 --> 2056.98
that was hysterical

2054.58 --> 2060.7
did fight the Flat Earth was like

2056.98 --> 2063.52
twisting his ideas so far in a bunch it

2060.7 --> 2066.04
was like it was hysterical

2063.52 --> 2069.879
I I literally laughed out loud when I

2066.04 --> 2073.72
heard him say and I quote

2069.879 --> 2077.7
you couldn't have a refracted Horizon if

2073.72 --> 2077.7
the Horizon wasn't geometric

2081.839 --> 2087.24
that is so funny

2084.46 --> 2087.2400000000002
uh

2090.22 --> 2094.0
I mean

2091.839 --> 2097.48
yeah so you could check that out but it

2094.0 --> 2100.06
is basically like flat earthers and then

2097.48 --> 2103.619
a fight to flatter typically as he is

2100.06 --> 2106.06
and getting more rambly or more quick

2103.619 --> 2108.58
and it just like goes completely

2106.06 --> 2110.859
ballistic like rampa sometimes does that

2108.58 --> 2111.94
and it's really funny when rumpus does

2110.859 --> 2114.4
that

2111.94 --> 2117.2200000000003
it's kind of adorning to me

2114.4 --> 2121.54
and fight the Flat Earth was saying such

2117.22 --> 2124.7799999999997
silly things it was it was like wow it's

2121.54 --> 2126.66
like bro you are tripping balls

2124.78 --> 2130.3
literally

2126.66 --> 2132.04
he was tripping balls

2130.3 --> 2135.2200000000003
I mean

2132.04 --> 2137.619
you couldn't have a refracted Horizon if

2135.22 --> 2141.04
the Horizon wasn't geometric

2137.619 --> 2142.78
you only a baller tripping balls could

2141.04 --> 2146.07
say something like that

2142.78 --> 2149.2690000000002
so freaking funny

2146.07 --> 2149.2690000000002
[Music]

2151.48 --> 2158.26
our Sesame Street character

2154.92 --> 2160.859
he kind of is a Sesame Street character

2158.26 --> 2160.8590000000004
isn't he

2161.079 --> 2163.98
oh [ __ ]

2164.02 --> 2168.599
I mean that would be really really funny

2166.18 --> 2168.5989999999997
man

2170.32 --> 2177.28
can you imagine like

2172.78 --> 2179.5
Big Bird and the bunch and then Craig is

2177.28 --> 2181.6800000000003
a special guest trying to explain to

2179.5 --> 2181.68
them

2181.9 --> 2188.079
why the Earth is a ball despite what the

2185.68 --> 2191.44
flat earthers say about it and just him

2188.079 --> 2193.78
doing his gross manipulation I I would

2191.44 --> 2196.48
like to see some that would be like

2193.78 --> 2199.119
totally surreal by the way would he ever

2196.48 --> 2202.96
do that he might just do that like I

2199.119 --> 2205.7200000000003
mean if the puppet crew would literally

2202.96 --> 2208.42
go along with like innocent people and

2205.72 --> 2209.859
be part of the fooler like be fooled by

2208.42 --> 2212.56
it typically

2209.859 --> 2214.7799999999997
I would like to see like that would be

2212.56 --> 2217.24
so surreal man

2214.78 --> 2221.98
to have like an anti-flat earther like

2217.24 --> 2224.2
gushing like he's on Sesame Street wow

2221.98 --> 2228.94
and especially Craig

2224.2 --> 2231.7
right you know he'd love it he'd love it

2228.94 --> 2233.92
you'd be so like yes

2231.7 --> 2235.7799999999997
you probably always wanted to do

2233.92 --> 2237.55
something like that

2235.78 --> 2241.4790000000003
you know can you feel it

2237.55 --> 2241.4790000000003
[Music]

2244.06 --> 2248.7999999999997
yeah you can feel it yeah I can

2247.06 --> 2251.5
literally like see it in front of me

2248.8 --> 2254.619
like a stage in him sitting there being

2251.5 --> 2256.24
all proud and glowing with energy and

2254.619 --> 2259.359
then like all the puppets around him

2256.24 --> 2262.359
like oh let me explain a particular

2259.359 --> 2262.359
foreign

2263.099 --> 2271.5
than like Bill Nye or anything right and

2266.44 --> 2271.5
old freaking drain old vampire

2272.74 --> 2277.2999999999997
Cookie Monster

2275.56 --> 2279.9
well

2277.3 --> 2279.9
Maybe

2288.099 --> 2292.42
bro and now topping that but that would

2290.92 --> 2295.96
never happen though

2292.42 --> 2299.079
it would be pretty freaky to top that

2295.96 --> 2300.82
with like an actual polite back and

2299.079 --> 2304.9
forth debate between

2300.82 --> 2307.2400000000002
a a good flat earther not an ethodian

2304.9 --> 2309.2200000000003
style not angry

2307.24 --> 2311.0789999999997
well but with good argument like it

2309.22 --> 2313.06
could be a bit technical but try to

2311.079 --> 2315.28
avoid the technical because yeah it's

2313.06 --> 2317.68
supposed to be for it's Sesame Street

2315.28 --> 2321.94
right so

2317.68 --> 2324.94
smart but concise not too Technical and

2321.94 --> 2327.2200000000003
then like a debate like with the puppets

2324.94 --> 2329.44
around them and their characters and

2327.22 --> 2331.24
like they could do little distractions

2329.44 --> 2334.42
it's like for example if the Flat Earth

2331.24 --> 2336.9399999999996
says like yeah it's it's a disc like a

2334.42 --> 2339.579
pizza or a cookie and then Cookie

2336.94 --> 2341.56
Monster right you could have all these

2339.579 --> 2344.8590000000004
little thingies

2341.56 --> 2346.9
it would be pretty freaking Epic

2344.859 --> 2348.7
you could make something like that that

2346.9 --> 2350.98
would be pretty epic but yeah you would

2348.7 --> 2354.2999999999997
have to like

2350.98 --> 2354.3
get it all to work

2354.52 --> 2359.68
like maybe another era maybe in 10 years

2358.119 --> 2361.599
when we're all

2359.68 --> 2365.0789999999997
free of this [ __ ] if that's ever gonna

2361.599 --> 2368.579
happen I don't know one can dream

and that's what I'm doing right now

2368.81 --> 2372.04
[Music]

2378.839 --> 2385.619
yeah that by now that is hysterical I

2383.2 --> 2388.8999999999996
mean that is worthy of literally

2385.619 --> 2391.56
like laughing on the spot face to face

2388.9 --> 2391.56
it is

2394.25 --> 2400.24

2396.94 --> 2403.06

it's like my back finally getting back

2403.06 --> 2405.42
to normal

2415.119 --> 2420.6400000000003
anyways yeah good to see you five roads

2417.339 --> 2423.2999999999997
we just rolled into the conversation

2420.64 --> 2423.2999999999997
ah

2431.2 --> 2437.2
oh that's a smart one LSG trying to

2434.2 --> 2440.98
figure out why the ball kept getting

2437.2 --> 2444.1189999999997
bigger and bigger then it hit me yep

2440.98 --> 2444.119
it's called perspective

2490.78 --> 2496.0
where I was at like right before I had

2493.3 --> 2499.32
those back issues it feels

2496.0 --> 2499.32
yeah I'm basically

2499.72 --> 2502.7999999999997
standing straight again

2503.32 --> 2508.0
awesome

2505.18 --> 2510.46
now all I have to do is not immediately

2508.0 --> 2513.72
proceed to overburden it again

2510.46 --> 2513.7200000000003

2530.32 --> 2538.06
I'm glad your father is like doing

2533.859 --> 2539.859
okay is he doing okay yeah that he had

2538.06 --> 2542.32
that issue right

2539.859 --> 2544.5989999999997
like a stroke or something did like

2542.32 --> 2547.1800000000003
how's the recovery going

2544.599 --> 2549.42
I guess good if he's making a joke that

2547.18 --> 2549.4199999999996
funny

2563.56 --> 2566.22

2576.339 --> 2581.7
yeah Cheswick is he is an interesting

2583.96 --> 2592.0
is this unique British

2587.859 --> 2595.14
way of doing it it's so weird

2592.0 --> 2595.14
but it's interesting

2597.7 --> 2608.2799999999997

2644.2 --> 2649.74
well I'm so glad of that and look like

2646.66 --> 2653.0789999999997
if you just keep vibrant and keep

2649.74 --> 2655.359
testing I mean even

2653.079 --> 2658.119
the little bit of lameness could maybe

2655.359 --> 2659.74
even over time kind of wear off and

2658.119 --> 2663.9
become functional again

2659.74 --> 2663.8999999999996
right it's all about not giving up hope

2667.839 --> 2672.819
right and as long as it's not super in

2670.119 --> 2675.339
the way then you don't have a lot of

2672.819 --> 2677.38
like demoralizing confrontations with

2675.339 --> 2680.319
even thinking about it

2677.38 --> 2682.3
so you're just gonna hold on

2680.319 --> 2685.7799999999997
as long as there is no

2682.3 --> 2688.0
annoying obstruction from it anyway yeah

2685.78 --> 2688.2400000000002
glad to glad to hear he's doing so much

2688.0 --> 2700.54
better

2688.24 --> 2703.06
[Music]

2700.54 --> 2705.96
I'm looking so forward to

2703.06 --> 2705.96
Christmas dinner

2707.74 --> 2710.339
it's been a week away

2710.44 --> 2713.04
yeah

2714.22 --> 2718.2999999999997
Monday

2716.56 --> 2720.2799999999997
next Monday

2718.3 --> 2724.2000000000003
then I'm gonna see my dad and my stepmom

2720.28 --> 2724.2000000000003
again I'm really looking forward to them

2725.99 --> 2730.06
[Music]

2727.72 --> 2734.2
where will I go

2730.06 --> 2738.54
well to my to my dad's house it's

2734.2 --> 2738.54
like 20 miles away or something

2742.9 --> 2749.1600000000003
it's like

2745.18 --> 2749.16
just south of Amsterdam

2749.74 --> 2758.14
no it's pretty close

2751.85 --> 2761.319
[Music]

2758.14 --> 2763.1189999999997
is it 20 miles yeah I don't know it's 20

2761.319 --> 2764.38
minute drive away

2763.119 --> 2767.38
anyway

2764.38 --> 2769.359
yeah looking forward to that a lot

2767.38 --> 2772.48
and I haven't had

2769.359 --> 2775.2999999999997
one single Christmas dinner like this

2772.48 --> 2778.18
that was there it was always awesome

2775.3 --> 2779.6000000000004
like always more awesome than I expected

2778.18 --> 2782.83
every time

2779.6 --> 2782.83
[Music]

2783.88 --> 2787.859
that's just this special energy there

2795.64 --> 2798.1189999999997
all right

2799.359 --> 2804.22
maybe maybe this time I'll ask if they

2802.48 --> 2807.54
could make some photos and like send it

2804.22 --> 2807.54
to me so I could show you guys

2810.52 --> 2818.079
right it's weird because I am just not a

2814.599 --> 2820.7200000000003
photograph it kind of guy

2818.079 --> 2822.6400000000003
unlike my brother by the way who got he

2820.72 --> 2824.7999999999997
had like collections of tens of

2822.64 --> 2828.52
thousands of photos

2824.8 --> 2830.8
by the age of like 30.

2828.52 --> 2833.56
like what the [ __ ] dude oh you're going

2830.8 --> 2835.2400000000002
on a vacation well he he has vacations

2833.56 --> 2837.16
like a Japanese

2835.24 --> 2839.56
sort of stereotype you know what I mean

2837.16 --> 2843.0989999999997
just click click click click click I

2839.56 --> 2845.2
don't do I am here to soak things up

2843.099 --> 2847.119
and then I make the click click click

2845.2 --> 2849.0989999999997
with My Soul

2847.119 --> 2850.7200000000003
and then it's literally have an imprint

2849.099 --> 2854.2200000000003
of that forever

2850.72 --> 2854.22
and photos

2856.72 --> 2861.3999999999996
but I think that my brother did it

2858.94 --> 2864.7000000000003
mostly because he just wanted to flick

2861.4 --> 2865.6600000000003
through it to get back to that moment or

2864.7 --> 2868.66
something

2865.66 --> 2870.8799999999997
but I rarely have that so I'm just not a

2868.66 --> 2872.68
very photograph type of person it's not

2870.88 --> 2875.079
like oh I'm gonna get a special event oh

2872.68 --> 2877.96
quickly you got to take some snapshots I

2875.079 --> 2880.6600000000003
don't have that right and I I don't have

2877.96 --> 2882.7
a smartphone so I don't literally have a

2880.66 --> 2886.7999999999997
photograph machine with me at all times

2882.7 --> 2886.7999999999997
like well almost everybody else

2888.64 --> 2894.48
but it yeah I'm gonna ask if they're

2891.28 --> 2894.48
make some photographs

2898.05 --> 2903.099
[Music]

2901.0 --> 2905.74
we're actually going to mention the Flat

2903.099 --> 2908.5
Earth during Christmas dude

2905.74 --> 2911.2599999999998
hello

2908.5 --> 2915.339
they know what I do

2911.26 --> 2917.8
they know I do an online show every day

2915.339 --> 2922.96
called Flat Earth early bird and that

2917.8 --> 2924.819
I'm almost at 1500 episodes so they know

2922.96 --> 2929.76
okay

2924.819 --> 2929.7599999999998
they know and they're with me by the way

2930.819 --> 2935.98
my dad is like really fully on board

2933.099 --> 2939.76
although he's not like deeply interested

2935.98 --> 2942.16
into it right he doesn't like have those

2939.76 --> 2944.26
types of town like I got part of the

2942.16 --> 2946.96
talent to do this from my mother not

2944.26 --> 2948.4
from my dad his mind doesn't work that

2946.96 --> 2952.18
way

2948.4 --> 2955.0
but he can very much follow me

2952.18 --> 2956.7999999999997
it's kind of like because I train him I

2955.0 --> 2960.46
train him to understand me and because

2956.8 --> 2962.2000000000003
of that well he understands me

2960.46 --> 2964.18
and the more mechanical things that I

2962.2 --> 2967.6189999999997
explain he has a bit of room for that

2964.18 --> 2967.6189999999997
because I gave that to him

2968.2 --> 2973.1189999999997
he doesn't have the tendency to kind of

2970.48 --> 2974.98
go out and be curious and learn about

2973.119 --> 2977.7400000000002
those types of things

2974.98 --> 2980.26
but he gets a really good understanding

2977.74 --> 2982.5989999999997
through well me

2980.26 --> 2986.0200000000004
but yeah my stepmom

2982.599 --> 2988.6800000000003
I mean she knows

2986.02 --> 2988.68
like

2989.319 --> 2995.68
she's not like gonna be like yeah the

2991.9 --> 2997.7200000000003
Earth is flat like that's like that it

2995.68 --> 2999.819
doesn't work for her like that but she

2997.72 --> 3002.06
definitely respects it she definitely

2999.819 --> 3003.9
knows that I'm not full of [ __ ]

3002.06 --> 3006.42
[Music]

3003.9 --> 3008.04
right it's just that I don't know maybe

3006.42 --> 3010.7400000000002
it's just a nerves her a bit maybe

3008.04 --> 3013.14
because there's also like this way of

3010.74 --> 3016.4399999999996
spirit talking

3013.14 --> 3018.06
right especially women I've heard women

3016.44 --> 3019.859
do that

3018.06 --> 3022.74
and

3019.859 --> 3026.4
they have like Globe thinking in there

3022.74 --> 3028.4399999999996
like as a parallel there's symbols and

3026.4 --> 3030.42
so it's like really weird like even my

3028.44 --> 3031.98
healer had that

3030.42 --> 3033.92
My Healer

3031.98 --> 3037.56
when he explains like

3033.92 --> 3039.839
influences or he literally like calls

3037.56 --> 3042.42
like that's that's a spirit from that

3039.839 --> 3045.2999999999997
planet and it's not literally a physical

3042.42 --> 3047.04
thing as anywhere but it's like in the

3045.3 --> 3050.3390000000004
spirit cosmology even in the spirit

3047.04 --> 3052.859
cosmology like they use Globes and

3050.339 --> 3055.14
spheres of influence and so it's like

3052.859 --> 3057.359
really weird to then suddenly get told

3055.14 --> 3060.44
like yeah the Earth is actually flat

3057.359 --> 3060.44
it's just what what

3061.619 --> 3065.819
because it also gets in the way of that

3064.5 --> 3068.94
type of thinking

3065.819 --> 3071.4
because they built the visualizations up

3068.94 --> 3074.04
like that now start to wonder like who

3071.4 --> 3076.8
did that who started to visualize

3074.04 --> 3077.7599999999998
spiritual things in Globes when did that

3076.8 --> 3079.92
start

3077.76 --> 3082.619
yeah

3079.92 --> 3086.339
I bet that was very very specific

3082.619 --> 3089.6600000000003
culturally placed at some point probably

3086.339 --> 3089.66
in the 20th century

3089.7 --> 3094.14
maybe the early 20th century

3092.64 --> 3097.2799999999997
it's weird

3094.14 --> 3099.359
and it's like a tradition of describing

3097.28 --> 3102.599
influences when you're doing like

3099.359 --> 3104.64
spiritual energy healing things

3102.599 --> 3106.5
anyway

3104.64 --> 3108.96
so they're both on board with the Flat

3106.5 --> 3112.04
Earth no problem

3108.96 --> 3112.04
don't worry about it

3115.319 --> 3118.68
but audio recording of Thanksgiving

3117.24 --> 3121.64
dinner

3118.68 --> 3121.64
that's amazing

3129.31 --> 3134.599
[Music]

3132.0 --> 3134.599
foreign

3134.82 --> 3138.8990000000003
[Music]

3140.579 --> 3147.9
I don't know if we have some recordings

3144.119 --> 3149.83
I mean we had like those Handycam video

3147.9 --> 3151.619
tapes like in the 90s

3149.83 --> 3154.2599999999998
[Music]

3151.619 --> 3156.9
it's like my mom

3154.26 --> 3159.599
and dad were like filming me sometimes

3156.9 --> 3161.1600000000003
but I don't know I I don't have those

3159.599 --> 3162.9
tapes I don't know what happened to

3161.16 --> 3164.819
those

3162.9 --> 3167.54
they might have gotten ruined or

3164.819 --> 3167.54
something or lost

3168.72 --> 3175.5589999999997
during the moving

3170.819 --> 3175.5589999999997
so I literally don't know yeah

3177.44 --> 3181.88
but I got plenty of photographs

3191.22 --> 3196.14
like maybe there's some audio recordings

3193.619 --> 3199.04
out there of me as a little kid

3196.14 --> 3201.1189999999997
I just know that I'll be extreme

3199.04 --> 3203.359
excruciatingly embarrassed if I hear

3201.119 --> 3203.359
that

3206.819 --> 3214.16
because of the way that I

3209.599 --> 3214.1600000000003
composed my voice back then

3217.559 --> 3221.6600000000003
it's really weird

3219.119 --> 3221.6600000000003
anyway

3227.76 --> 3232.26
with family you have unconditional love

3230.339 --> 3234.96
doesn't matter if you

3232.26 --> 3237.2000000000003
well not everybody zept happy not

3234.96 --> 3237.2
everybody

3252.599 --> 3256.2000000000003
you're come to see the new Avatar with

3255.18 --> 3259.5
your dad

3256.2 --> 3261.359
first Christmas okay

3259.5 --> 3263.28
well

3261.359 --> 3266.9
you might want to take a pillow with you

3263.28 --> 3266.9
because it's three hours

3269.64 --> 3276.0389999999998
just giving you a heads up septepi

3272.75 --> 3276.039
[Music]

3276.26 --> 3280.8
yeah I don't know if your old man is

3278.88 --> 3282.839
gonna

3280.8 --> 3286.6400000000003
actually be able to sit through all that

3282.839 --> 3286.64
I mean three hours

3287.05 --> 3290.26
[Music]

3294.18 --> 3298.3289999999997
foreign

3294.96 --> 3298.329
[Music]

3298.68 --> 3302.5789999999997
but seriously you might want to take a

3300.839 --> 3306.24
pillow with you like for your ass

3302.579 --> 3309.059
because sitting for three hours is

3306.24 --> 3311.0989999999997
can be kind of tea especially for your

3309.059 --> 3315.98
dad just take a pillow with you for your

3311.099 --> 3315.98
dad to sit on so it's I don't know

3317.69 --> 3327.219
[Music]

3327.24 --> 3330.02
foreign

3342.14 --> 3347.16
halfway through yeah but still

3344.76 --> 3351.619
I mean halfway through that still means

3347.16 --> 3351.6189999999997
one and a half hours sitting straight

3352.079 --> 3355.52
okay twice

3355.8 --> 3364.46
hey skeptic 936 could see you by the way

3360.9 --> 3364.46
it's slow still what

3367.079 --> 3371.579
450 oh yeah

3369.96 --> 3375.619
wait what

3371.579 --> 3375.619
that's crazy early

3376.2 --> 3381.0589999999997
oh you are a real early bird then aren't

3378.96 --> 3383.54
you skeptic

3381.059 --> 3383.5400000000004
damn

3391.14 --> 3394.7999999999997
I mean there is technically a bit of an

3393.78 --> 3396.3
irony

3394.8 --> 3399.9
to

3396.3 --> 3405.44
being an early bird show when I myself

3399.9 --> 3409.1600000000003
rarely get out of bed before 12 p.m

3405.44 --> 3409.16
except maybe in summer

3409.68 --> 3414.5989999999997
for this show wow really

3413.04 --> 3416.819
that's amazing

3414.599 --> 3418.98
I do hope you can actually

3416.819 --> 3420.66
do something really productive with the

3418.98 --> 3421.68
morning I mean people that do get up

3420.66 --> 3424.2599999999998
early

3421.68 --> 3428.22
tend to be very

3424.26 --> 3430.92
active and productive early right that's

3428.22 --> 3433.9199999999996
also what I'm trying to stimulate

3430.92 --> 3435.2400000000002
I myself hate getting up like actually

3433.92 --> 3438.839
early

3435.24 --> 3440.339
even for work why because I always in my

3438.839 --> 3443.099
memory throughout my life I've always

3440.339 --> 3445.619
had like like very annoying stomach

3443.099 --> 3448.44
issues in the early morning

3445.619 --> 3452.04
that's been like since I was a teen

3448.44 --> 3455.18
I don't like the early morning

3452.04 --> 3455.18
except maybe

3456.119 --> 3459.839
no no it's just no it doesn't matter

3458.099 --> 3461.819
like whether it's summer or winter I

3459.839 --> 3464.5789999999997
just don't like it

3461.819 --> 3466.5589999999997
I mean in the winter sometimes I might

3464.579 --> 3468.42
want to get up really early just to

3466.559 --> 3470.94
catch more sunlight but I'm still I will

3468.42 --> 3473.359
still have those issues

3470.94 --> 3473.359
anyway

3473.64 --> 3477.859
work at two or three max okay

3479.16 --> 3482.819
uh so you're like a really early morning

3481.14 --> 3485.5989999999997
shift

3482.819 --> 3485.599
type of guy

3489.18 --> 3491.7799999999997
all right

3493.079 --> 3496.94
I'm glad to be able to provide

3497.579 --> 3501.6800000000003
yeah

3500.099 --> 3504.8590000000004
I'd like to be up in Sunrise

3501.68 --> 3504.859
self-employed right

3515.64 --> 3518.0589999999997
all right

3519.359 --> 3526.39
yes Sunrise I mean I've seen quite a few

3523.619 --> 3529.51
Sunrise well no not really

3526.39 --> 3529.5099999999998
[Music]

3529.92 --> 3536.819
I don't really see a lot of sunrises

3533.46 --> 3539.94
see like Morning Glory when I may have a

3536.819 --> 3541.74
really late night yeah during the summer

3539.94 --> 3544.14
right

3541.74 --> 3546.6189999999997
but I rarely actually see the sunrise

3544.14 --> 3546.6189999999997
itself

3557.52 --> 3562.099
I do pretty much get all the Sundowns

3559.92 --> 3562.099
though

3562.5 --> 3573.8
foreign

3562.8 --> 3573.8
[Music]

3575.339 --> 3582.359
but yeah I mean with my setup yeah I

3578.88 --> 3586.76
might get up like after 12 and then

3582.359 --> 3586.7599999999998
I'll be the most fresh

3587.099 --> 3592.38
like when I do that I do actually like

3589.859 --> 3594.7799999999997
in me I don't have I don't need any like

3592.38 --> 3597.2400000000002
warm-up period or anything

3594.78 --> 3599.46
when I live like this right I literally

3597.24 --> 3602.16
get out of bed and then

3599.46 --> 3606.0
well unless I haven't slept enough and

3602.16 --> 3607.98
feel a bit wonky then it's like five ten

3606.0 --> 3611.04
minutes and

3607.98 --> 3613.68
I'm like perfectly fit and like can

3611.04 --> 3616.2
immediately use pretty

3613.68 --> 3618.5989999999997
pretty heavy thinking and all that

3616.2 --> 3620.64
and and that's why I choose this time

3618.599 --> 3622.079
slot that's why I originally chose this

3620.64 --> 3623.94
time slot even during the Flat Earth

3622.079 --> 3628.7000000000003
talks days right

3623.94 --> 3628.7000000000003
I typically chose two o'clock

3628.92 --> 3632.76
and then for the Early Bird start at two

3631.14 --> 3634.6189999999997
o'clock and then later doubled the

3632.76 --> 3636.92
amount of hours and so it started one

3634.619 --> 3636.92
o'clock

3639.0 --> 3643.52
and just works perfectly for me anyway

3643.98 --> 3648.839
but it's pretty miserable in the

3645.299 --> 3651.0
Netherlands today yeah

3648.839 --> 3654.43
but I mean at least it's not so freaking

3651.0 --> 3658.02
cold anymore is that heavy

3654.43 --> 3660.54
[Music]

3658.02 --> 3663.24
could be worse

3660.54 --> 3666.74
I mean it's not storming or anything

3663.24 --> 3666.74
it's just kind of rainy

3670.23 --> 3675.78
[Music]

3672.18 --> 3677.0989999999997
10 Celsius lighter in here oh yeah I

3675.78 --> 3679.4500000000003
think that's pretty much the same over

3677.099 --> 3683.76
here let me check

3679.45 --> 3687.0789999999997
[Music]

3683.76 --> 3687.079
11 degrees Celsius

3692.88 --> 3700.799
wow it says it's gonna get 12 tomorrow

3697.799 --> 3702.92
right so no no more Frosty days for a

3700.799 --> 3702.92
while

3705.49 --> 3710.7599999999998
[Music]

3707.299 --> 3712.619
I'd rather see some snow Yeah well maybe

3710.76 --> 3714.059
you'll have yeah maybe in February I

3712.619 --> 3716.6400000000003
mean usually

3714.059 --> 3720.92
if it's going to snow it snows around my

3716.64 --> 3720.92
birthday in early February so

3721.859 --> 3728.48
I mean we haven't had actual snow in

3725.16 --> 3728.48
December in a long time

3729.9 --> 3734.4
well that's not entirely Fair because

3732.24 --> 3737.43
sometimes in December like a few

3734.4 --> 3740.53
snowflakes fall but then they never last

3737.43 --> 3740.5299999999997
[Music]

3741.299 --> 3746.579
so you never actually get

3744.42 --> 3747.96
snow on the ground it just melts away

3746.579 --> 3752.299
quickly

3747.96 --> 3752.299
it's usually what happened past years

3756.9 --> 3763.46
the cold is in North America I guess

3761.28 --> 3763.46
foreign

3784.64 --> 3789.1189999999997
of course yeah

3787.319 --> 3791.339
all right

3789.119 --> 3794.54
now there wasn't there have been no

3791.339 --> 3794.54
snowflakes here at all

3806.64 --> 3810.7799999999997
don't remember it

3808.799 --> 3813.24
earlier this year

3810.78 --> 3815.9
January February I don't remember if it

3813.24 --> 3815.8999999999996
snowed at all

3818.04 --> 3821.94
right

3820.02 --> 3824.46
I could find out though by the way

3821.94 --> 3826.38
literally by looking up the Early Bird

3824.46 --> 3829.16
shows from that time and just going

3826.38 --> 3829.1600000000003
through the first

3829.319 --> 3832.98
like the first minute when I do my

3831.24 --> 3835.68
weather report I can literally track

3832.98 --> 3838.079
yeah weather that way of course I could

3835.68 --> 3841.7
probably look it up to Google and just

3838.079 --> 3841.7000000000003
say whether on this date

3841.859 --> 3851.619
or like weather chart anyway

3845.12 --> 3851.6189999999997
[Music]

3851.76 --> 3854.96
distracted here

3861.96 --> 3863.94
all right

3863.099 --> 3867.0190000000002
all right

3863.94 --> 3867.0190000000002
[Music]

3874.98 --> 3880.26
all right yeah yeah uh yesterday Jim Bob

3878.099 --> 3882.5
that was pretty weird what's this guy on

3880.26 --> 3882.5
there

3885.74 --> 3892.859
Andreas from exertus

3889.559 --> 3894.96
that was pretty surreal

3892.859 --> 3898.74
I mean that guy was basically talking

3894.96 --> 3903.5
Spirit mechanics but in his own way

3898.74 --> 3903.5
and you seemed pretty solid

3910.619 --> 3915.6600000000003
might be interesting to watch if you got

3913.68 --> 3917.94
some time

3915.66 --> 3920.42
uh

3917.94 --> 3920.42
what else

3933.72 --> 3936.319
foreign

3937.38 --> 3944.28
oh yeah I remember yeah I watched the

3940.079 --> 3945.9
movie or second half of a movie

3944.28 --> 3948.0
it's like the last

3945.9 --> 3951.54
predator

3948.0 --> 3954.38
the franchise movie prey

3951.54 --> 3954.38
and

3957.359 --> 3961.7
yeah I don't know what to think about it

3968.339 --> 3973.38
it felt like

3970.44 --> 3976.16
of the Predator itself was just heavily

3973.38 --> 3976.1600000000003
down powered

3976.859 --> 3983.359
right so it's like they used the theme

3980.94 --> 3983.359
of it

3983.52 --> 3987.059
they went to prayer was slightly

3985.02 --> 3989.46
different and

3987.059 --> 3993.5
and we had some interesting things but

3989.46 --> 3993.5
it it just did not have

3995.099 --> 4000.2000000000003
maybe it was the music maybe the music

3997.44 --> 4003.7400000000002
just wasn't suitable enough

4000.2 --> 4006.2
because the music was a huge huge part

4003.74 --> 4008.6189999999997
of the original Predator and even the

4006.2 --> 4008.6189999999997
second one

4009.2 --> 4015.8799999999997
and with this one it's just

4012.859 --> 4021.7
yeah there was like Gore and

4015.88 --> 4021.7000000000003
visceral [ __ ] but it didn't have that

4023.119 --> 4029.02
I don't know it just didn't have that

4025.94 --> 4029.02
feel to it in a way

4030.68 --> 4034.72
better than the rest of the sequels

4036.5 --> 4042.559
I mean there's another what is it uh

4039.14 --> 4046.16
what's another Predator as well

4042.559 --> 4048.559
on some other planet I mean that one

4046.16 --> 4051.5
did kind of work I mean they got the

4048.559 --> 4054.38
feel they literally recycled the music

4051.5 --> 4055.339
from the original Predator and being in

4054.38 --> 4058.099
a jungle

4055.339 --> 4060.2
right I mean I didn't think that one was

4058.099 --> 4062.059
really bad because they used the same

4060.2 --> 4064.0389999999998
formula

4062.059 --> 4066.3190000000004
I mean it wasn't as good as the original

4064.039 --> 4068.539
but

4066.319 --> 4072.5
and this one is just like

4068.539 --> 4075.76
they just tried something else

4072.5 --> 4075.76
and I

4078.98 --> 4082.83
like there were good things about it

4082.16 --> 4085.52
like

4082.83 --> 4087.859
[Music]

4085.52 --> 4090.38
it was interesting to basically face

4087.859 --> 4093.2599999999998
like Warrior culture of Native Americans

4090.38 --> 4094.94
and the way they did that but on the

4093.26 --> 4097.52
other hand

4094.94 --> 4102.319
yeah as the prayer as a predator movie

4097.52 --> 4104.2390000000005
it just didn't really do it it just

4102.319 --> 4107.359
yeah

4104.239 --> 4109.4
I mean that first movie and the second

4107.359 --> 4112.400000000001
one too like that thing just gives me

4109.4 --> 4116.179
like whoa like keeps me pumping it's

4112.4 --> 4118.48
like really exciting really this one is

4116.179 --> 4118.4800000000005
like

4118.819 --> 4122.1990000000005
it it doesn't do it

4128.779 --> 4132.819
teenage girl beating up the predator

4133.58 --> 4140.0599999999995
well it's in a way look

4137.779 --> 4142.6990000000005
she did build a pretty interesting

4140.06 --> 4144.859
tactics I mean I actually did kind of

4142.699 --> 4146.66
liked it the girl

4144.859 --> 4148.88
as a character

4146.66 --> 4151.88
but yeah

4148.88 --> 4154.04
I mean seriously one slap from that

4151.88 --> 4156.08
predator and that girl would have broken

4154.04 --> 4159.679
her neck

4156.08 --> 4163.1
like with who she literally is as a

4159.679 --> 4165.88
flesh and Bone person right not who the

4163.1 --> 4168.259
character's supposed to be right

4165.88 --> 4172.04
[Music]

4168.259 --> 4174.319
I mean a woman like that a girl like

4172.04 --> 4177.04
they are kind of fragile

4174.319 --> 4180.5
I I'm not trying to be all

4177.04 --> 4183.08
male dominant but seriously and by the

4180.5 --> 4186.38
way those guys

4183.08 --> 4188.6
fellow Indian Brothers also

4186.38 --> 4191.0
they were all kind of lean and so they

4188.6 --> 4193.9400000000005
were much more like agile and quick

4191.0 --> 4195.739
right quick sharp agile perceptive and

4193.94 --> 4198.199
that's how they hunt that's the way that

4195.739 --> 4201.139999999999
works but seriously one

4198.199 --> 4203.739
punch from a [ __ ] predator and you're

4201.14 --> 4203.7390000000005
Doom

4207.199 --> 4209.98
let's just

4211.52 --> 4216.4400000000005
and she got slapped and well when you'd

4214.34 --> 4220.1
get slapped like that she should be

4216.44 --> 4222.5599999999995
lying there with broken bones like ah

4220.1 --> 4226.6990000000005
right I mean he did that [ __ ] to the

4222.56 --> 4229.219
other guys to well more grown men and

4226.699 --> 4231.919999999999
all that so it's just like it was a bit

4229.219 --> 4234.08
woke like that

4231.92 --> 4238.46
it didn't stand out to me like it was

4234.08 --> 4240.86
really woke but it was annoying

4238.46 --> 4243.08
because

4240.86 --> 4245.179
I feel just like the Predator itself was

4243.08 --> 4247.82
downplayed just so that the little girl

4245.179 --> 4250.2390000000005
could kill it

4247.82 --> 4254.0599999999995
and it just didn't feel like an

4250.239 --> 4256.759999999999
overwhelming alien power like what the

4254.06 --> 4259.400000000001
Predator really stands for I mean

4256.76 --> 4262.58
freaking goes up against a full military

4259.4 --> 4263.48
Guerrilla Squad with heavy weapons and

4262.58 --> 4267.679
[ __ ]

4263.48 --> 4271.419999999999
and like tons of experience the like

4267.679 --> 4271.42
dude no it's just

4271.82 --> 4277.94
[Music]

4275.239 --> 4280.659
the Predator didn't have his helmet on

4277.94 --> 4280.659
in that movie

4282.199 --> 4286.639999999999
yeah but it doesn't really matter did

4284.179 --> 4288.679
you see Predator 2

4286.64 --> 4293.1990000000005
I mean

4288.679 --> 4293.1990000000005
he loses that helmet doesn't matter

4294.02 --> 4299.0
they can still function I mean the the

4296.6 --> 4302.84
function of the visor

4299.0 --> 4305.42
thing and how he looks was intricate to

4302.84 --> 4307.9400000000005
the original Predator

4305.42 --> 4312.04
they didn't even do that they didn't

4307.94 --> 4312.04
even use it at all

4314.0 --> 4319.159
right well it's intricate to the plot

4316.52 --> 4321.4400000000005
that like how he sees that he can see

4319.159 --> 4324.82
they they only used a couple like oh

4321.44 --> 4327.08
infrared but it is it has no

4324.82 --> 4329.98
different styles different things that

4327.08 --> 4329.98
he could it was just

4334.48 --> 4339.699
underdeveloped which seems extremely

4336.86 --> 4339.699
unrealistic

4345.699 --> 4352.12
they have a pretty bad Vision without

4348.08 --> 4352.12
them well they just see infrared

4353.06 --> 4355.84
like

4356.12 --> 4360.58
but like overwhelming or something

4373.04 --> 4377.9
I don't know I was just not very

4376.159 --> 4380.839999999999
gratified by the movie at the end

4377.9 --> 4382.639999999999
although I did like the camera the main

4380.84 --> 4385.88
character's character Arc I did like

4382.64 --> 4388.88
that it's just that like yeah

4385.88 --> 4392.42
was not really a worthy predator

4388.88 --> 4395.08
that part is just like yeah okay I

4392.42 --> 4397.52
didn't get like oh Jesus

4395.08 --> 4401.38
I wasn't like

4397.52 --> 4403.820000000001
scared and wanting to run

4401.38 --> 4405.86
like in the original Predators where

4403.82 --> 4408.0199999999995
things are so [ __ ] scary sometimes

4405.86 --> 4409.699
you like feel like you want to run

4408.02 --> 4411.92
because you're like sucked in the movie

4409.699 --> 4414.379999999999
and you feel like I want to run away I

4411.92 --> 4416.83
didn't have that at all in this one just

4414.38 --> 4418.64
not at all

4416.83 --> 4423.0199999999995
[Music]

4418.64 --> 4427.2390000000005
it just felt more like a a Gore Fest

4423.02 --> 4427.2390000000005
but without the actual tension

4428.48 --> 4436.78
anyway so I watched that

4432.02 --> 4436.780000000001
and yeah very mixed feelings about that

4437.12 --> 4441.8
I mean there were some things about it

4438.86 --> 4443.86
that were pretty cool and but like it

4441.8 --> 4446.42
just didn't abide to the original

4443.86 --> 4449.299999999999
formula of how a predator movie should

4446.42 --> 4451.88
be made what made it so great the music

4449.3 --> 4454.46
the tension build up that is actually

4451.88 --> 4456.76
really scary because it has to be like

4454.46 --> 4459.38
that the enemy The Predator is

4456.76 --> 4463.06
overwhelming and not just a little but

4459.38 --> 4463.06
like really overwhelming

4466.46 --> 4470.179
like

4468.26 --> 4473.14
like no matter what you do they have

4470.179 --> 4477.82
like a weapon that are like three times

4473.14 --> 4477.820000000001
beyond that every single time

4480.08 --> 4482.86
I know

4483.44 --> 4488.54
I mean where was the laser shoulder

4485.48 --> 4490.759999999999
blasting you had just a bunch of rods

4488.54 --> 4494.69
the shooting rods or something and it's

4490.76 --> 4496.06
like what where's the freaking laser Man

4494.69 --> 4500.239
[Music]

4496.06 --> 4503.410000000001
I mean that thing was [ __ ] awesome

4500.239 --> 4513.599999999999
scary but awesome anyway

4503.41 --> 4513.599999999999
[Music]

4514.159 --> 4517.78
tricks resurrections

4518.06 --> 4520.84
okay

4523.1 --> 4526.4800000000005
you thought that was good

4529.1 --> 4534.02
I didn't think it was that good I mean

4531.14 --> 4537.280000000001
it was cool and it seemed just more

4534.02 --> 4537.280000000001
Rococo and more

4542.6 --> 4547.1
it's just like they took the wine and

4544.64 --> 4548.84
they let it ripen for a few years then

4547.1 --> 4550.400000000001
you open it back I was like yeah it's a

4548.84 --> 4553.900000000001
little bit more ripe and wine but it's

4550.4 --> 4553.9
just I don't know

4554.48 --> 4559.178999999999
I didn't like the twist

4559.52 --> 4563.06
which yeah is basically the core of the

4561.679 --> 4566.12
movie how

4563.06 --> 4568.88
they made it like the other experiences

4566.12 --> 4570.679
were just in a video game I mean I

4568.88 --> 4572.659000000001
thought that was I thought that was

4570.679 --> 4575.2390000000005
[ __ ] annoying

4572.659 --> 4578.54
and super distracting it just it caused

4575.239 --> 4580.5199999999995
everything to be longer again

4578.54 --> 4582.739
like why

4580.52 --> 4585.34
didn't they just continue where left off

4582.739 --> 4585.339999999999
pretty much

4585.92 --> 4592.4
like have him reawaken

4589.04 --> 4594.739
return not get it

4592.4 --> 4598.4
dude I wrote a mini script for us like

4594.739 --> 4601.959999999999
yeah he reawakens and now

4598.4 --> 4601.96
he's like in The Matrix

4602.06 --> 4605.719
almost like an agent but he isn't an

4604.04 --> 4608.239
agent

4605.719 --> 4610.219
he's like his own man kind of like the

4608.239 --> 4613.718999999999
mayor of engine but he is like actually

4610.219 --> 4616.159
human like human born

4613.719 --> 4619.159
the one and then

4616.159 --> 4623.44
like things continue further and like

4619.159 --> 4623.44
the issues with Zion continue further

4625.58 --> 4630.98
and yeah hopefully like grafting in the

4628.76 --> 4633.320000000001
other layers of the Matrix right that it

4630.98 --> 4635.36
turns out like wait this was all just to

4633.32 --> 4637.639999999999
stall again and there was another Matrix

4635.36 --> 4640.12
Beyond

4637.64 --> 4640.12
anyway

4646.46 --> 4651.86
yeah but the problem with the with

4649.04 --> 4654.86
franchise is in ruining it by sequels is

4651.86 --> 4658.219
that they use the sequels to try to cash

4654.86 --> 4661.159
in on the glory of the original product

4658.219 --> 4662.2390000000005
instead of actually putting in more

4661.159 --> 4665.659
energy

4662.239 --> 4667.759999999999
to make it even bigger right

4665.659 --> 4670.5199999999995
because they lack Vision the vision

4667.76 --> 4674.9800000000005
becomes I want money instead of I want

4670.52 --> 4678.4400000000005
this idea to be even greater by like

4674.98 --> 4680.86
exponentially enhancing it through the

4678.44 --> 4680.86
sequel

4683.42 --> 4689.659
it was weird but not

4686.0 --> 4693.04
I mean it was it had some entertaining

4689.659 --> 4693.04
moment it was stylish

4694.159 --> 4696.759999999999
but

4697.54 --> 4701.32
it just seems a bit

4703.9 --> 4709.82
Superfluous I mean you don't have to

4706.52 --> 4712.719
watch that movie it's not significant to

4709.82 --> 4712.719
the original Three

4714.02 --> 4718.64
it's like an attempt almost to like

4716.239 --> 4721.159
restart it

4718.64 --> 4724.159000000001
so it doesn't actually contribute that

4721.159 --> 4725.5599999999995
much to the previous movies at all

4724.159 --> 4728.48
it it

4725.56 --> 4730.580000000001
discontinues things that were developing

4728.48 --> 4733.639999999999
there in ways

4730.58 --> 4736.4
I don't like that

4733.64 --> 4737.659000000001
I didn't like that they like jumped into

4736.4 --> 4740.54
the future

4737.659 --> 4743.599999999999
in the first place that was a mistake

4740.54 --> 4746.06
they should have immediately continued

4743.6 --> 4748.04
where they dropped off

4746.06 --> 4751.06
on the other hand yeah the actors are

4748.04 --> 4751.06
now older so

4751.34 --> 4754.2390000000005
couldn't do that

4761.3 --> 4764.6
what

4762.679 --> 4766.84
Venom scared me what are you talking

4764.6 --> 4766.84
about

4772.58 --> 4775.239
oh

4778.82 --> 4782.259999999999
I never watched that

4785.48 --> 4791.48
maybe it is because I just hate it

4789.26 --> 4793.58
I don't even want to know it because I

4791.48 --> 4795.86
can feel on the surface that I hate it I

4793.58 --> 4796.61
don't like Phantom

God stuff Predator is just

4847.52 --> 4853.88
don't do that it's just another Creature

4851.12 --> 4856.099999999999
From Another World

4853.88 --> 4858.4400000000005
with really Advanced developed

4856.1 --> 4862.400000000001
technology with a lot of thought put

4858.44 --> 4864.799999999999
into it by the development team

4862.4 --> 4869.08
it's not the same thing I mean it

4864.8 --> 4869.08
Predator is like more like Batman

4869.659 --> 4874.9
is actually quite close in ways

4872.06 --> 4874.900000000001
mechanically

4877.46 --> 4882.2
right heavy technology to to do all

4879.98 --> 4884.54
these things

4882.2 --> 4886.94
[Music]

4884.54 --> 4889.34
I mean

4886.94 --> 4892.299999999999
what the hell would Batman do against

4889.34 --> 4892.3
Venom right

4895.28 --> 4900.5599999999995
I don't know about those characters I

4899.0 --> 4903.02
don't know they might have some weakness

4900.56 --> 4905.9800000000005
or whatever I don't know I don't care

4903.02 --> 4905.9800000000005
I just know that

4908.48 --> 4916.0599999999995
Predator does not belong in the

4912.02 --> 4916.06
superhero Universe it's ridiculous

4924.26 --> 4928.54
I would have developed some kind of yeah

4926.3 --> 4928.54
but

4928.82 --> 4934.9
I want to get the chance I mean Venom's

4931.34 --> 4934.900000000001
just gonna jump on him right

4935.9 --> 4939.04
and then it's over

4940.46 --> 4943.88
how is he going to get a chance to like

4942.92 --> 4946.46
oh

4943.88 --> 4949.1
I gotta develop something against that

4946.46 --> 4951.4
no it's already done

4949.1 --> 4951.400000000001
yeah

4951.52 --> 4955.4800000000005

4964.34 --> 4969.14
Darth helmet playing with his dolls

4966.739 --> 4973.879999999999
again that's literally what that stupid

4969.14 --> 4976.1
[ __ ] is Batman Superman Venom [ __ ] that

5016.84 --> 5021.400000000001
I mean that thing that they did in

5019.3 --> 5023.679
Spaceballs that one scene might be like

5021.4 --> 5025.179
one of the most influential scenes in

5023.679 --> 5028.179
cinema history

5025.179 --> 5030.9400000000005
because it is infinitely funny and it's

5028.179 --> 5032.58
surreal in where that behavior actually

5030.94 --> 5036.099999999999
pops up

5032.58 --> 5038.82
within Square t power structures it's

5036.1 --> 5038.820000000001
unbelievable

5782.32 --> 5788.259999999999
yeah of course

5785.32 --> 5791.799999999999
I mean but Obama sort of even mentioned

5788.26 --> 5793.6
Flat Earth blowers authority of course

5791.8 --> 5796.0
you know

5793.6 --> 5797.26
and yeah we were kind of expecting Trump

5796.0 --> 5799.48
to do that

5797.26 --> 5801.58
you know that it's really funny that I

5799.48 --> 5805.0
have a very distinct memory in my Dark

5805.0 --> 5810.1
don't know who I was doing that telling

5807.159 --> 5813.339999999999
him no don't do that

5810.1 --> 5816.76
stay out of freaking Flat Earth

5813.34 --> 5819.04
and said it early on and I don't even

5816.76 --> 5821.820000000001
yeah I know why I have that Dark World

5819.04 --> 5821.82
Vision memory

5822.1 --> 5826.2390000000005
but now looking at how things are

5825.1 --> 5829.900000000001
turning

5826.239 --> 5834.299999999999
if I had actually said that

5829.9 --> 5834.299999999999
that would have been the wiser decision

5834.88 --> 5838.7390000000005
Trump started space force right

5838.84 --> 5844.4400000000005
I mean Trump could be like an anti-flat

5842.139 --> 5844.4400000000005
earther

5846.34 --> 5851.8
just everything he does just makes

5848.98 --> 5854.138999999999
things worse makes things more [ __ ]

5851.8 --> 5855.1
more distracted doubling down on the

5854.139 --> 5856.38
illusions

5855.1 --> 5859.0
he is

5856.38 --> 5860.679
technically through what he does a

5859.0 --> 5866.38
satanism

5860.679 --> 5869.82
he just makes Illusions worse and bigger

5866.38 --> 5869.82
that's what satanists do

5875.8 --> 5879.639
you see oh and break down that REM so

5878.5 --> 5881.86
yeah

5879.639 --> 5885.9400000000005
that's some weird freaking flashbacks

5881.86 --> 5887.92
over that one you know why because in my

5885.94 --> 5890.44
past I think my

5887.92 --> 5892.12
parents

5890.44 --> 5895.12
it's a moment

5892.12 --> 5897.699
try to make me listen to that song to

5895.12 --> 5900.76
see if I would recognize things in it

5897.699 --> 5902.678999999999
but it was just completely not with it I

5900.76 --> 5904.06
didn't like the song it was like that's

5902.679 --> 5907.179
old

5904.06 --> 5909.400000000001
I was just I didn't listen but I

5907.179 --> 5910.84
remember like that they made me listen

5909.4 --> 5912.879999999999
to that song and I was just not

5910.84 --> 5914.4400000000005
impressed but now I understand it's like

5912.88 --> 5916.0
yeah but it's because of what they're

5914.44 --> 5918.28
talking about but I was just not

5916.0 --> 5920.5
listening back then I have a memory of

5918.28 --> 5921.46
that okay how weird is that I have a

5920.5 --> 5924.34
memory

5921.46 --> 5925.84
that's a little kid being forced to

5924.34 --> 5927.9400000000005
listen something and not being

5925.84 --> 5930.82
interested

5927.94 --> 5933.839999999999
but realizing now like why they tried to

5930.82 --> 5933.84
make me listen to that

5935.98 --> 5941.03
which song

5937.56 --> 5944.26
what is it called I don't know

5941.03 --> 5947.32

5944.26 --> 5950.02
it's the one where they're talking about

where are you where are you going like

5950.02 --> 5953.860000000001
if you face North what is what does that

5952.06 --> 5956.280000000001
mean if you're east and west and like

5953.86 --> 5959.32
things you do

5956.28 --> 5963.0599999999995
stand in the place that you live is that

5959.32 --> 5963.0599999999995
the name yeah makes sense

5966.34 --> 5970.78
and if you don't pay attention it's like

5968.08 --> 5973.0
yeah it's like sort of a trendy goofy

5970.78 --> 5975.219
little kid song but they're actually

5973.0 --> 5976.96
talking about

5975.219 --> 5978.639
smart things

5976.96 --> 5984.2390000000005
and the

5978.639 --> 5984.2390000000005
music video is like really showing [ __ ]

5984.4 --> 5989.44
like occult messages in there

5987.4 --> 5992.799999999999
like they're basically trying to tell

5989.44 --> 5994.599999999999
you through visuals and suggestion that

5992.8 --> 5998.62
the Earth is not a ball

5994.6 --> 6002.3
and flat and how things work

5998.62 --> 6002.3
but they're not overtly saying it

6010.38 --> 6015.12
right anyway I'm gonna take a two minute

6012.659 --> 6017.28
break and then I'll probably gonna run

6015.12 --> 6020.159
out to show

6017.28 --> 6022.139
how time has flown

6020.159 --> 6025.08
still need to think of a title for the

6025.08 --> 6028.34
anyway I'll be right back

all kinds of weird [ __ ]

so I'm not doing that

6235.38 --> 6240.6
oh God yeah the ozone layer nonsense I

6239.04 --> 6241.8
mean I had a whole issue about that

6240.6 --> 6245.88
remember

6241.8 --> 6249.8
on my show like makes no sense

6245.88 --> 6249.8
how can ozone be a layer

6252.719 --> 6258.84
ah gas stretch in all directions like

6255.719 --> 6261.119
how can it be a layer it makes no sense

6258.84 --> 6263.6990000000005
like to call it a layer makes no sense

6261.119 --> 6266.639
and what the hell would ozone do all the

6263.699 --> 6268.46
way up there when it's probably way too

6266.639 --> 6271.26
dense

6268.46 --> 6274.199
to linger around there I mean it should

6271.26 --> 6277.860000000001
be mostly helium and hydrogen

6274.199 --> 6281.159
not ozone ozone is heavier so how is it

6277.86 --> 6284.239
being a layer up there it makes no

6281.159 --> 6284.239
freaking sense

6286.86 --> 6290.37

6340.739 --> 6348.32

6348.84 --> 6359.219
seems to be lessened recently

6354.06 --> 6362.2390000000005
what do you mean ozone is heavier denser

6359.219 --> 6362.2390000000005
it's denser

6362.28 --> 6366.48
and it's a gas so it's going to spread

6364.32 --> 6367.619
out in all directions anyway

6366.48 --> 6371.5199999999995
but

6367.619 --> 6374.04
if it were to somehow not mix in

6371.52 --> 6375.84
then it would still be denser than the

6374.04 --> 6377.94
helium and hydrogen

6375.84 --> 6382.139
that's going to be surrounded with at

6377.94 --> 6385.678999999999
the supposed level of height where it is

6382.139 --> 6390.179
claimed to be it makes no freaking sense

6410.88 --> 6417.36
we need a good

6413.719 --> 6419.9
reliable sewer worker for president how

6417.36 --> 6419.9
about that

6420.48 --> 6425.159
how about somebody that can uh literally

6422.82 --> 6427.619
clean the sewers like somebody that

6425.159 --> 6429.0599999999995
literally does that goes into like those

tunnel [ __ ]

6429.06 --> 6433.02
stinky and that cleans it up right in

6432.0 --> 6435.719
the suit

6433.02 --> 6440.34
maybe the United States just literally

6435.719 --> 6442.8
needs an actual veteran sewer worker as

6440.34 --> 6444.84
president how about that

6442.8 --> 6447.0
sounds really weird right

6444.84 --> 6450.26
but what if it will work

6447.0 --> 6450.26
you never really know

6451.199 --> 6456.299999999999
I mean the sewer work is going to have

6453.42 --> 6457.76
humility at least right

6456.3 --> 6460.9800000000005

6457.76 --> 6464.719

joking

6485.52 --> 6489.3
right

6486.6 --> 6491.9400000000005
what if you had like a a guy that

6489.3 --> 6496.02
literally is like at the head of like

6491.94 --> 6498.96
organized sewer cleaning company

6496.02 --> 6501.42
that that's like

6498.96 --> 6503.34
just meticulous and does the [ __ ] that

6501.42 --> 6505.619
nobody really wants and does it

6503.34 --> 6509.219
eloquently with profit I mean

6505.619 --> 6510.48
wouldn't that be a great formula

6509.219 --> 6512.82
for somebody that's going to be

6510.48 --> 6515.339999999999
president of the United States which is

6512.82 --> 6520.259999999999
pretty much become a spiritual [ __ ]

6515.34 --> 6523.38
that requires a big cleaning project

6520.26 --> 6526.8
well who better to do it than
