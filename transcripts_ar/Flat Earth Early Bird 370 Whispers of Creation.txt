James Mason michael roark good servant

231.51 --> 235.63899999999998
22 yeah good to see you all

237.53 --> 241.28
it's interesting

246.459 --> 255.879
yeah I tried some new food things and

249.25 --> 257.799
they were surprisingly good yeah you

255.879 --> 264.96
know I keep on just trying things out

257.799 --> 268.85999999999996
and I tried yesterday to get some yeah

264.96 --> 272.56
it was yeah it to try anyway vegan

268.86 --> 276.28000000000003
bitter Bala so it's like these typical

272.56 --> 278.71
Dutch things it's like a crusty outside

276.28 --> 286.44899999999996
usually they have fillings of like this

278.71 --> 289.15
mash of of beef meat and and gravy you

286.449 --> 291.13
could say and that's very typical Dutch

289.15 --> 293.73999999999995
and nice well they made a vegan version

291.13 --> 295.84
out of it yeah you never really know

293.74 --> 298.59000000000003
what its gonna be like but I tried it

295.84 --> 301.0
and it was like wow that is really

298.59 --> 303.13
amazingly good yeah doesn't sound this

301.0 --> 307.66
doesn't take like beef that's the

303.13 --> 310.3
typical Irby things a lot of vegan

307.66 --> 312.639
things have but it was really nice so

310.3 --> 317.139
that was a nice surprise just as a bit

312.639 --> 320.83
of a side dish with other dinner yeah

317.139 --> 325.84000000000003
that was cool chemical [ __ ] no he was

320.83 --> 333.07
all organic and I didn't detect any soy

325.84 --> 335.38
in it either so also I fried it in my

333.07 --> 339.43
own olive oil so I'm pretty sure that

335.38 --> 341.11
all of it was just fine and I feel great

339.43 --> 342.82
today

341.11 --> 345.28000000000003
and weirdly enough I've just been

342.82 --> 347.11
thinking a lot and a lot and I always do

345.28 --> 352.29999999999995
that keep on grinding on the things that

347.11 --> 354.909
I've said and even like how my feelings

352.3 --> 356.949
going certain views and it's weird

354.909 --> 360.669
because as I'm going over this stuff

356.949 --> 363.849
again but with my feelings a little bit

360.669 --> 366.75899999999996
more at peace under control at a

363.849 --> 369.039
distance not triggering me so much as I

366.759 --> 371.56
think about these things that trigger is

369.039 --> 373.77
a big word but it's just my inner

371.56 --> 373.77
monologue

373.87 --> 388.61
and it all looks so different so yeah I

385.939 --> 392.59900000000005
guess yeah take it for whatever it's

388.61 --> 395.599
worth what it just seems like something

392.599 --> 398.24
may be restored momentarily at least or

395.599 --> 401.86
it might be that I'm just so incredibly

398.24 --> 406.28000000000003
sensitive to the daylight in the winter

401.86 --> 408.199
because every time the daylight comes

406.28 --> 410.33
through and it's not very cloudy and

408.199 --> 418.069
cream during the winter then I feel just

410.33 --> 421.19
really good I don't know we'll see

418.069 --> 462.289
anyway I'm gonna get on Tom Parker very

421.19 --> 467.169
curious all right I'll try again a

462.289 --> 467.169
little later or if he pops up a

471.02 --> 481.19899999999996
that's it well it shouldn't matter Tom

479.279 --> 485.30899999999997
Parker as long as you just mute your

481.199 --> 488.699
YouTube page and keep the skype open it

485.309 --> 490.65000000000003
should work just fine or do you have

488.699 --> 493.189
don't you have any map microphone

490.65 --> 493.18899999999996
whatsoever

509.07 --> 512.16
[Music]

521.88 --> 534.899
yeah anyway I guess he's not coming on

526.519 --> 539.61
well let's see yeah I called this

534.899 --> 542.19
hangout whispers of creation yesterday

539.61 --> 545.88
there were some yeah even the the Flat

542.19 --> 547.6800000000001
Earth debates day after show from Friday

545.88 --> 550.649
I think it was and I knew it was gonna

547.68 --> 553.949
be good because I was just putting out

550.649 --> 555.66
energy during the Friday debates almost

553.949 --> 558.92
with the knowledge he's like yeah it's

555.66 --> 564.449
gonna be in the weekend so it's gonna be

558.92 --> 566.49
that like often it's like content or

564.449 --> 569.25
streams especially daily are like a

566.49 --> 571.5600000000001
temporary fountain and people go feeding

569.25 --> 573.66
on it but then in the weekends for Flat

571.56 --> 576.149
Earth debates it's like there's the

573.66 --> 578.73
fountains kind of shut down but because

576.149 --> 581.12
of the the premieres from Friday this is

578.73 --> 585.089
just like a little bit popping up and

581.12 --> 587.279
but people get very firstly for it it's

585.089 --> 591.0600000000001
funny how that works so I'm just like

587.279 --> 594.6
okay with that in insight I'm just gonna

591.06 --> 596.8499999999999
put out more so it lessens the thirst a

594.6 --> 601.4390000000001
little bit more I don't know just I

596.85 --> 603.8290000000001
guess strategical thinking energy

601.439 --> 603.829
management

607.08 --> 615.48
it only works of course if I feel I have

610.48 --> 618.3100000000001
any kind of energy management for myself

615.48 --> 620.14
worthy enough for me to be able to do

618.31 --> 622.18
that because if I'm just gonna feel

620.14 --> 623.8
really shitty or like good I need to

622.18 --> 624.5799999999999
take my distance and then yeah I'm not

623.8 --> 634.9599999999999
gonna do that

624.58 --> 636.64
but anyway alright yeah yeah Tom Parker

634.96 --> 639.85
in Skype you said like yeah I wouldn't

636.64 --> 641.86
join the show so I thought like okay Jim

639.85 --> 647.97
the show that I didn't understand that

641.86 --> 647.97
that was a long-term thing

658.19 --> 665.48
a socialist oh dear that Tom Parker

664.49 --> 671.2090000000001
don't worry about it

665.48 --> 675.98
and you don't need to caps it a low

671.209 --> 682.55
pumpkin and Karen B by the way and Bates

675.98 --> 688.629
sixty our MC Sparrow music no yours not

682.55 --> 688.6289999999999
blocked I unblocked you without question

689.529 --> 695.75
yeah glow Buster's was kind of good as

692.75 --> 697.49
well but eventually I kind of lost track

695.75 --> 702.17
and ended up watching the Flat Earth

697.49 --> 703.879
debates from Friday again basically to

702.17 --> 709.279
try see if it was as good as I thought

703.879 --> 713.1800000000001
it was and yeah and mostly after that

709.279 --> 716.23
watching a lot of Star Trek again still

713.18 --> 716.2299999999999
going through all of it

727.92 --> 734.16
Oh mr. crew yep

732.749 --> 743.339
but he's still hanging around he was

734.16 --> 745.8589999999999
around yesterday a lot it's kind of

743.339 --> 749.489
funny because especially if I haven't

745.859 --> 750.9290000000001
given him anything yet and I gotta go

749.489 --> 753.089
like on the roof for a smoke or

750.929 --> 755.2389999999999
something it's kind of it is funny

753.089 --> 760.1690000000001
because he literally tries to walk

755.239 --> 762.359
behind me like not even a meter distance

760.169 --> 763.889
like really close by so I just go

762.359 --> 766.47
walking it's like following me and I'm

763.889 --> 771.54
like oh I'm not like scared of course

766.47 --> 775.589
but like why are you doing it like you

771.54 --> 779.04
don't need to like fall in line or

775.589 --> 781.9490000000001
something for me to give you food you

779.04 --> 786.9889999999999
know it's just a friendship and you're a

781.949 --> 789.299
young guy and I want to help you out but

786.989 --> 792.2090000000001
I don't know maybe he just likes doing

789.299 --> 794.819
it maybe it's because I he imagines that

792.209 --> 803.54
I'm a very big CRO being in black and

794.819 --> 803.54
all Lori what did you say

807.199 --> 810.4889999999999
don't do that

813.089 --> 823.349
yeah I am next generation I don't really

819.179 --> 827.779
like deep space 9 and the old the oldest

823.349 --> 831.4190000000001
series I have respected in a way but

827.779 --> 834.529
it's like something else to me

831.419 --> 839.629
Star Trek all the Star Trek's are like

834.529 --> 842.519
yeah like a story world with technology

839.629 --> 846.539
development all the Plumtree cultural

842.519 --> 848.579
entanglements blah blah blah but the

846.539 --> 852.029
original Star Trek to me is more like

848.579 --> 856.319
the theater version it is more like a

852.029 --> 859.199
stage play that was filmed and then

856.319 --> 861.8689999999999
became a TV see it because it everything

859.199 --> 866.159
looks like a stage play they act very

861.869 --> 870.509
staged Act II and it's so different so

866.159 --> 875.489
the old Star Trek I respected it's not

870.509 --> 877.439
my favorite you know there's some some

875.489 --> 880.8290000000001
old-fashioned Star Trek lovers out there

877.439 --> 885.389
that really love that series yeah I

880.829 --> 889.6389999999999
guess I get it but it's just not what I

885.389 --> 893.4590000000001
like about the whole Star Trek the most

889.639 --> 895.649
did like Captain Kirk a lot I think it's

893.459 --> 897.3889999999999
just so weird it's like funny and

895.649 --> 899.519
hysterical and kind of cool and

897.389 --> 901.589
sometimes almost you start to believe

899.519 --> 905.9590000000001
like yeah the person could be that way

901.589 --> 908.9590000000001
it's so weird this is acting is very

905.959 --> 908.959
interesting

914.14 --> 927.29
okay well not everybody likes Star Trek

916.88 --> 929.21
more colored even when I was a young kid

927.29 --> 932.2099999999999
I always thought that the the old Star

929.21 --> 936.5600000000001
Trek was just kind of silly also because

932.21 --> 939.77
of the sound and sound effects that they

936.56 --> 942.529
use typically and the next generation

939.77 --> 945.4
just that really made me take it all

942.529 --> 945.4
more seriously

947.91 --> 951.0799999999999
[Music]

952.87 --> 961.08
oh yeah well hey I am ID please change

957.58 --> 964.08
that name I don't want to say that

961.08 --> 964.08
please

968.86 --> 975.79
yeah there's a two-parter I guess about

973.09 --> 979.5600000000001
creation but look a lot of Star Trek

975.79 --> 982.93
series have a lot of little truth and

979.56 --> 984.0699999999999
conceptual thinking jewels in them all

982.93 --> 985.7199999999999
over the place

984.07 --> 988.63
almost every Star Trek The Next

985.72 --> 993.61
Generation is filled with them

988.63 --> 997.24
I remember Voyager to an extent being

993.61 --> 1001.11
filled with it as well I really love

997.24 --> 1004.65
that series you had the discovery that

1001.11 --> 1007.71
newer thing that is also filled but it's

1004.65 --> 1017.13
not really it's more like overfilled

1007.71 --> 1019.77
it's like it's something else but yeah

1017.13 --> 1021.27
all of the typical Star Trek series are

1019.77 --> 1023.97
filled with their own little truth

1021.27 --> 1025.83
things I don't know maybe Deep Space 9

1023.97 --> 1028.74
as well I don't know I literally have

1025.83 --> 1030.33
never managed to watch the whole series

1028.74 --> 1034.68
I just don't like it

1030.33 --> 1037.4299999999998
I don't like the characters they never

1034.68 --> 1037.43
spoke to me

1044.95 --> 1049.8400000000001
or maybe not not even the characters

1047.41 --> 1052.96
it's just a setup of it just didn't

1049.84 --> 1055.24
speak to me and I had it Babylon 5 to

1052.96 --> 1057.79
contrast it with which was so much

1055.24 --> 1063.01
better and it is funny again by the way

1057.79 --> 1065.8899999999999
that I I have some lore of what goes on

1063.01 --> 1067.78
with like actors as well because even in

1065.89 --> 1073.48
the next generation there's the specific

1067.78 --> 1076.36
actor he plays a Kardashian what is it

1073.48 --> 1078.49
the general or something or he's like an

1076.36 --> 1080.35
opponent and there's like even we are

1078.49 --> 1082.78
time entanglement stuff going on

1080.35 --> 1086.05
concerning him I think or a trickery

1082.78 --> 1087.8799999999999
it's very fascinating but that voice is

1086.05 --> 1094.02
very pronounced he's the same voice that

1087.88 --> 1094.0200000000002
is the the great diplomat from the

1094.62 --> 1103.9299999999998
what's the name again the Narnians no

1098.38 --> 1106.92
wait man I have to look that's weird

1103.93 --> 1106.92
that I'd forget him

1107.2 --> 1112.88
[Music]

1117.87 --> 1122.1789999999999
[Music]

1119.27 --> 1127.96
and the one that were subjected by the

1122.179 --> 1127.96
Centauri why is it not in here

1136.65 --> 1141.96
yeah the Norn right it's weird

1139.67 --> 1144.78
especially since we talked about Narnia

1141.96 --> 1148.8600000000001
a lot but anyway he is the same actor

1144.78 --> 1150.6299999999999
and in one of the last movies yeah there

1148.86 --> 1152.58
was like a tragic background thing

1150.63 --> 1157.2900000000002
happened because that actor actually

1152.58 --> 1158.76
died so that's why he kind of

1157.29 --> 1161.309
disappeared off the scenes and it was a

1158.76 --> 1165.9
great tragedy because he was such an

1161.309 --> 1169.02
inspired energy-rich actor that would

1165.9 --> 1172.01
always play charismatic diplomats and

1169.02 --> 1177.11
stuff and he was very good at it I

1172.01 --> 1181.1299999999999
should see if I can figure out his name

1177.11 --> 1181.1299999999999
let's go to IMDB

1187.54 --> 1190.599
[Music]

1195.25 --> 1202.08
yeah jakar andreas katsu las that's the

1199.9 --> 1202.0800000000002
guy

1216.22 --> 1227.21
2006 is his last he didn't voices in

1221.18 --> 1229.25
video games as well yeah a lot of the

1227.21 --> 1231.83
painting that we get to deal with and

1229.25 --> 1240.11
enjoy in life if you like science

1231.83 --> 1241.85
fiction is he's a part of that Splinter

1240.11 --> 1243.8
Cell he had a voice that's his last

1241.85 --> 1249.02
thing he did in 2006

1243.8 --> 1251.47
it doesn't say let me get to Wikipedia

1249.02 --> 1251.47
with that

1256.67 --> 1262.63
yeah 2006 they died

1266.39 --> 1275.3500000000001
uh he was a tall guy as well how much is

1273.14 --> 1275.3500000000001
that

1277.31 --> 1280.52
[Music]

1283.51 --> 1292.27
yeah yeah he was six foot four for your

1289.75 --> 1299.2
information for the Bears out there he

1292.27 --> 1300.82
was an awesome guy just I don't know who

1299.2 --> 1304.81
he was in real life you know but I just

1300.82 --> 1307.87
know that every time he pops up in some

1304.81 --> 1310.06
series or whatever he's just like he

1307.87 --> 1314.1999999999998
takes the stage with his energy and his

1310.06 --> 1320.08
voice great very subtle I don't know

1314.2 --> 1326.0800000000002
yeah too bad that some of some of them

1320.08 --> 1328.96
just fall away all right

1326.08 --> 1332.9199999999998
anyway enough about Babylon 5 they got

1328.96 --> 1335.77
drugged off from deep space 9 to Babylon

1332.92 --> 1339.52
5 and yeah in Babylon 5 it just had

1335.77 --> 1342.82
great great characters and I never

1339.52 --> 1346.53
enjoyed the characters from deep space 9

1342.82 --> 1351.37
that much not saying it was miscast or

1346.53 --> 1353.17
it just didn't match up for me

1351.37 --> 1355.4499999999998
personally and there's others that

1353.17 --> 1358.3200000000002
totally disagree of course and that are

1355.45 --> 1360.67
like oh no deep space 9 was the [ __ ]

1358.32 --> 1364.6499999999999
that's what I watched I didn't like the

1360.67 --> 1364.65
others for this or that reason whatever

1373.07 --> 1380.9299999999998
is it yeah cause the ludie well yeah

1375.86 --> 1383.57
that's you know when you poke at the

1380.93 --> 1390.5600000000002
wrong time yeah I get pissed off and it

1383.57 --> 1392.6899999999998
start saying that kind of stuff cuz just

1390.56 --> 1395.87
because I'm very seriously pissed off

1392.69 --> 1400.76
doesn't mean that I can't try to bend

1395.87 --> 1404.3799999999999
that into a joke that is funny not

1400.76 --> 1404.3799999999999
humiliating per se

1408.91 --> 1421.8400000000001
the square flat earth from the Book of

1411.76 --> 1426.19
Enoch the square yeah Marcus Marcus

1421.84 --> 1428.6399999999999
wasn't he the doctor that the human

1426.19 --> 1428.64
doctor

1432.05 --> 1442.309
I like that character - he was like very

1437.44 --> 1448.28
interesting he was like eh he was a

1442.309 --> 1453.94
liberal you know but he was very like

1448.28 --> 1455.21
very hardcore principle in his ethics oh

1453.94 --> 1457.25
wait

1455.21 --> 1459.32
he wasn't arranger oh yeah yeah yeah he

1457.25 --> 1465.38
came in little later market that Marcus

1459.32 --> 1468.1399999999999
yeah yeah the British guy the very very

1465.38 --> 1470.66
very British guy that seemed like he

1468.14 --> 1474.41
just came out of a Robin Hood movie yeah

1470.66 --> 1479.21
I I don't know I thought he was an

1474.41 --> 1481.0700000000002
interesting he he was a weird character

1479.21 --> 1484.28
because characters like that tend to be

1481.07 --> 1488.09
become like stereotypes but turned out

1484.28 --> 1489.92
to have quite a depth so it was it was

1488.09 --> 1494.36
not my favorite character but he had

1489.92 --> 1496.5500000000002
interesting character development that

1494.36 --> 1499.4289999999999
would seem very genuine and it's

1496.55 --> 1504.53
complicated to accomplish in a series so

1499.429 --> 1509.15
I agreed to that I also liked the doctor

1504.53 --> 1511.34
a lot it was fascinating because it

1509.15 --> 1514.01
would be like an example of a proper

1511.34 --> 1517.22
liberal that would not corrupt to the

1514.01 --> 1520.55
darkness and there were many tests for

1517.22 --> 1528.679
this with him I really liked that bit

1520.55 --> 1531.46
because it anyway Laurie stop poking

1528.679 --> 1531.46
Karen be

1536.75 --> 1544.52
that don't talk to her if you want to be

1540.26 --> 1562.669
in this chat just do your own thing

1544.52 --> 1570.1689999999999
stop bugging the lady okay yeah and

1562.669 --> 1574.3700000000001
Karen be down just let it let it cool

1570.169 --> 1576.0800000000002
off let him just take his time out down

1574.37 --> 1588.1
kick him in the back while you can't

1576.08 --> 1588.1
talk back that's not nice all right

1590.15 --> 1592.8100000000002
Wow

1593.68 --> 1605.15
I'm probably sure that he's not the

1597.17 --> 1608.02
studio sexiest - come on just anyway

1605.15 --> 1608.02
what were you talking about

1617.61 --> 1625.57
yeah

1619.419 --> 1628.8390000000002
all right well Bates 60 RMC the thing

1625.57 --> 1631.1789999999999
about the whole sci-fi thing when you

1628.839 --> 1632.859
figure out flat earth is that well it's

1631.179 --> 1635.169
you can't say that

1632.859 --> 1637.869
sci-fi doesn't work anymore it's just

1635.169 --> 1640.3290000000002
that the whole setting the whole thing

1637.869 --> 1642.4589999999998
with from the from the angle of the

1640.329 --> 1645.629
suspense of disbelief actually go and

1642.459 --> 1648.909
was actually believing it once that

1645.629 --> 1653.9189999999999
switches then just everything changes

1648.909 --> 1658.1490000000001
the context of it all changes and I was

1653.919 --> 1662.1390000000001
able to despite as it were the

1658.149 --> 1667.149
heartbreak still managed to just find

1662.139 --> 1670.809
value in it so i just let latched on to

1667.149 --> 1673.869
that instead of just letting it grow

1670.809 --> 1677.019
bitter and then ending up hating it

1673.869 --> 1678.4289999999999
because that's what's the use of that

1677.019 --> 1681.239
there's going to be people out there

1678.429 --> 1681.239
loving it

1690.25 --> 1702.21
so yeah it just takes some time to get

1693.159 --> 1707.919
used and besides why would we have to be

1702.21 --> 1711.07
in a universe where Star Trek things

1707.919 --> 1713.5300000000002
happen do you know how many insane just

1711.07 --> 1716.049
totally crazy things happen in that

1713.53 --> 1719.37
series with like time to like at one

1716.049 --> 1722.83
point the freaking Borg vessel just

1719.37 --> 1724.78
appears from the future and tries to

1722.83 --> 1728.4399999999998
destroy the earth okay that's supposedly

1724.78 --> 1733.8999999999999
taking place in like the 90s like are

1728.44 --> 1737.23
you seriously like no I feel perfectly

1733.9 --> 1739.21
safe in the actual realm that we have

1737.23 --> 1741.3700000000001
that does not have an outer space with

1739.21 --> 1743.2
China and aliens and super high-tech

1741.37 --> 1745.57
[ __ ] that could just decide to destroy

1743.2 --> 1747.6100000000001
us for some tactical reason at any point

1745.57 --> 1754.51
before we could even realize that it was

1747.61 --> 1758.9799999999998
out there no thanks I prefer this realm

1754.51 --> 1762.58
but I do love the stories in retrospect

1758.98 --> 1764.679
once I got over the idea that yeah it is

1762.58 --> 1766.78
all fake the only thing now worrisome

1764.679 --> 1768.97
about it to me is that there may still

1766.78 --> 1774.61
be people out there taking it literal

1768.97 --> 1777.22
and because they may actually believe it

1774.61 --> 1779.6499999999999
they could accidentally allow to derail

1777.22 --> 1781.69
their lives in some way that is really

1779.65 --> 1785.14
the real detriment that I'm worried

1781.69 --> 1789.429
about but yeah if everybody got over

1785.14 --> 1791.23
that then we just have a good story just

1789.429 --> 1793.72
like Lord of the Rings how many people

1791.23 --> 1795.73
in the world are seriously believing

1793.72 --> 1800.32
that the Lord of the Rings may be

1795.73 --> 1801.909
literal and you know there's not a lot

1800.32 --> 1804.37
of people but there's a lot of people

1801.909 --> 1806.98
really inspired by it learn the

1804.37 --> 1810.789
languages learn how to write elven and

1806.98 --> 1813.7
all that you know it kind of like with

1810.789 --> 1817.09
Star Trek as well like the Klingon

1813.7 --> 1820.3300000000002
language is exactly defined in Star Trek

1817.09 --> 1822.84
and yeah a real Star Trek fans a bit

1820.33 --> 1828.36
nerdy then sometimes

1822.84 --> 1831.81
just learn it but yeah nobody believes

1828.36 --> 1834.6599999999999
that the Lord of the Rings was probably

1831.81 --> 1837.81
really truly absolutely the real thing

1834.66 --> 1841.19
you know it's a it's a presupposition of

1837.81 --> 1845.85
fantasy and that's more clear with that

1841.19 --> 1849.66
story with that realm Wow yeah if you

1845.85 --> 1855.33
look the Star Trek it's kind of the same

1849.66 --> 1858.39
thing except yeah it's been set up in a

1855.33 --> 1859.98
way that one could presuppose if one

1858.39 --> 1864.23
didn't know better that that might

1859.98 --> 1867.8600000000001
actually become the real future somehow

1864.23 --> 1867.8600000000001
that's the big difference

1876.79 --> 1881.97
[Music]

1879.26 --> 1887.79
it's John Watson yeah I was waiting for

1881.97 --> 1891.21
somebody to say that so true yeah it's

1887.79 --> 1898.71
funny how they migrated the the the

1891.21 --> 1901.02
stereotypical focus to the ears I love

1898.71 --> 1903.1200000000001
them or why love them hate them they're

1901.02 --> 1905.01
annoying but they should be and they're

1903.12 --> 1909.33
also very small by the way if you

1905.01 --> 1914.1299999999999
noticed that it's just great I just love

1909.33 --> 1926.85
the Ferengi's that they exist there it's

1914.13 --> 1929.1000000000001
so yeah makes it more real in a way hmm

1926.85 --> 1932.309
I heard about that series the invaders

1929.1 --> 1937.23
that's I don't know if I've seen I think

1932.309 --> 1940.9189999999999
that I was probably linked up to it it's

1937.23 --> 1944.85
like an older there's many very old

1940.919 --> 1947.0400000000002
sci-fi in the black and white era that

1944.85 --> 1952.74
were really fascinating with what they

1947.04 --> 1955.4099999999999
put they were really wide thinking they

1952.74 --> 1958.049
were like real science fiction that made

1955.41 --> 1959.73
you think in a movie that was simply the

1958.049 --> 1962.22
old science fiction yeah I've seen some

1959.73 --> 1964.77
of that time that it was still in

1962.22 --> 1968.07
communication with no mean um he knows a

1964.77 --> 1970.1399999999999
lot of those and linked us up to some

1968.07 --> 1973.49
interesting movies back then that's like

1970.14 --> 1973.49
yeah two years ago I think

1988.45 --> 1997.27
excuse me the studio 68 did you just

1994.34 --> 1997.27
seriously say that

2007.84 --> 2011.4889999999998
have you ever read the books

2039.89 --> 2046.2900000000002
nah-nah off with his head here's a

2042.36 --> 2051.0
wrench but I I just like wonder why

2046.29 --> 2054.57
people would say that in a chat on a

2051.0 --> 2057.96
channel named Arwen that I've explained

2054.57 --> 2059.7200000000003
many times this is an elven name given

2057.96 --> 2063.03
to me based on the Lord of the Rings

2059.72 --> 2065.73
specifically with a meaning at all and

2063.03 --> 2074.34
then somebody just says Lord of doing

2065.73 --> 2079.14
these gay no that's not it

2074.34 --> 2081.929
hey you know what I'll take it a little

2079.14 --> 2085.1099999999997
step further okay you calling them gay

2081.929 --> 2086.88
why don't you point in a Lord of the

2085.11 --> 2091.29
Rings and that's this has been an actual

2086.88 --> 2098.6400000000003
issue yeah where there's a gay

2091.29 --> 2105.96
relationship the entire franchise mm-hmm

2098.64 --> 2109.23
oh you didn't know that mmm yeah well I

2105.96 --> 2112.65
did it's one of the things that I kind

2109.23 --> 2115.71
of liked about it it's like ah finally

2112.65 --> 2118.8
not not some gay guy being pushed in my

2115.71 --> 2121.4700000000003
face somewhere you know again I don't

2118.8 --> 2123.57
mind gay people

2121.47 --> 2125.25
I just don't wanted to have that stuff

2123.57 --> 2128.8500000000004
shoved in my face all the time

2125.25 --> 2131.61
and Lord of the Rings well even the

2128.85 --> 2136.98
movies but especially the book didn't do

2131.61 --> 2139.6800000000003
that was like too serious it was to

2136.98 --> 2150.39
spiritual serious in a way that its own

2139.68 --> 2153.93
way and I like that so yeah Oh as in

2150.39 --> 2154.3799999999997
stupid I didn't think it was stupid at

2153.93 --> 2161.5099999999998
all

2154.38 --> 2164.37
I think it's a very sensible story about

2161.51 --> 2167.0600000000004
adolescence about the struggles of

2164.37 --> 2167.06
adolescence

2169.4 --> 2172.59
[Music]

2174.549 --> 2184.39
Samwise was in love no Samwise was in

2177.89 --> 2186.41
bro love okay now look every time now

2184.39 --> 2189.109
that Lord of the Rings

2186.41 --> 2192.17
I guess pops up in a conversation you're

2189.109 --> 2194.45
thinking about the movies okay yeah and

2192.17 --> 2197.9590000000003
there were elements in the movies that

2194.45 --> 2199.9399999999996
were kind of gay but that's because the

2197.959 --> 2204.6499999999996
actors because the actors were probably

2199.94 --> 2207.38
gay and they interpret it as such or

2204.65 --> 2209.829
whatever it didn't really come across I

2207.38 --> 2214.15
don't know maybe that's what they wanted

2209.829 --> 2216.829
maybe they wanted throwed out to be gay

2214.15 --> 2221.989
and it kind of did seem kind of gay at

2216.829 --> 2224.329
times but it's miscast because if you

2221.989 --> 2226.459
and I'm Siri I read the books I

2224.329 --> 2229.19
literally read the books it's the one of

2226.459 --> 2234.5589999999997
the few bigger books that I actually

2229.19 --> 2241.549
read through it's not gay it's all about

2234.559 --> 2245.029
bro passion about loyalty about going

2241.549 --> 2247.759
through the hard times for your friends

2245.029 --> 2251.569
and for the survival of all things it's

2247.759 --> 2253.369
it's anything but gay so whatever weird

2251.569 --> 2256.819
a little interactions are displayed in

2253.369 --> 2263.569
the movies that seem kind of gay that's

2256.819 --> 2265.67
just I don't know it's either like a

2263.569 --> 2269.269
homo obsession that you see gay and

2265.67 --> 2273.9790000000003
everything or yeah it might be slightly

2269.269 --> 2276.14
Mis acted in a way and I don't know why

2273.979 --> 2278.8089999999997
if that was the actors or if it was the

2276.14 --> 2280.67
script that was slightly changed or it

2278.809 --> 2281.63
was the director just saying no it's got

2280.67 --> 2283.789
to be like weed

2281.63 --> 2288.9790000000003
yeah movies are complicated and it's

2283.789 --> 2292.1800000000003
Hollywood okay it's all gay so that

2288.979 --> 2295.479
doesn't make Lord of the Rings gay

2292.18 --> 2297.4199999999996
because it's not if you can find a

2295.479 --> 2301.2799999999997
single reference

2297.42 --> 2304.9500000000003
in the movies or in the books where like

2301.28 --> 2308.15
homosexuality is addressed be my guest

2304.95 --> 2317.8799999999997
and pointed out for me because you know

2308.15 --> 2321.84
gay is gay but if it's just men having

2317.88 --> 2323.94
feelings that's not gay maybe gay people

2321.84 --> 2327.3500000000004
want that to be gay because they want

2323.94 --> 2329.94
more gay people for blood pumping but

2327.35 --> 2333.2999999999997
that doesn't make it gay just make it

2329.94 --> 2334.89
feelings I have feelings too and I have

2333.3 --> 2338.21
subtle feelings and I have bro

2334.89 --> 2343.37
protective feelings oh yeah

2338.21 --> 2349.95
doesn't make me gay either cuz I have no

2343.37 --> 2359.85
sexual attraction to men the very notion

2349.95 --> 2362.18
just makes me makes me nauseated gay

2359.85 --> 2368.75
also means something that's a bit lame

2362.18 --> 2368.75
okay it's a bit lame

2373.73 --> 2382.91
right so yeah but yeah that's kinda yeah

2378.62 --> 2384.89
I used to say when it was lame I kind of

2382.91 --> 2386.5099999999998
stopped doing that when roughly around

2384.89 --> 2390.2
my 20 should have probably stopped that

2386.51 --> 2397.4300000000003
when I was 16 because it's really kind

2390.2 --> 2401.29
of dumb yeah yeah I did call the Lhari I

2397.43 --> 2403.6699999999996
did that and you know why because

2401.29 --> 2406.9
everybody will kept telling me you're

2403.67 --> 2410.3
freakin gay you're gay and I was like I

2406.9 --> 2411.17
have no experience that tells me that

2410.3 --> 2415.4
I'm gay

2411.17 --> 2416.12
but maybe I just need to do it in front

2415.4 --> 2420.89
of everyone

2416.12 --> 2424.31
and to see to have it determined once

2420.89 --> 2428.2999999999997
and for all if I am gay or not so I did

2424.31 --> 2432.32
that and then I almost threw up and it's

2428.3 --> 2435.2000000000003
like yeah did you see that yeah yeah I

2432.32 --> 2437.69
didn't like that yeah the guy liked it I

2435.2 --> 2444.0699999999997
didn't I literally had to push him away

2437.69 --> 2444.07
from me because I just not gay

2447.55 --> 2454.9900000000002
and had no hard feelings to that guy you

2449.95 --> 2457.71
know he was gay I am NOT I don't know

2454.99 --> 2457.7099999999996
what he is ie

2462.33 --> 2465.429
[Music]

2472.65 --> 2479.559
yeah yeah and by the way James Mason

2475.9 --> 2482.17
about that yeah those friends still kept

2479.559 --> 2484.869
calling me gay after that so it didn't

2482.17 --> 2488.079
quite work out no it was really to prove

2484.869 --> 2491.799
to myself because I just didn't

2488.079 --> 2494.619
understand it and everybody was all just

2491.799 --> 2496.45
like oh yeah it's they were like oh it

2494.619 --> 2499.0
doesn't really matter and nobody's gay

2496.45 --> 2503.8799999999997
us it's like anything is possible kind

2499.0 --> 2507.01
of like unhinged liberal approach I was

2503.88 --> 2510.819
drenched in that [ __ ] around me that's

2507.01 --> 2513.15
what happened there and yeah you start

2510.819 --> 2513.15
to wonder

2519.09 --> 2525.33
but yeah I have no words no more

2522.72 --> 2528.25
wondering about it I'm not gonna be full

2525.33 --> 2533.179
to that [ __ ]

2549.17 --> 2558.41
all right

2551.66 --> 2561.71
I don't know sir Sarita Cosentino I I've

2558.41 --> 2564.64
never yeah if the if GUI is supposed to

2561.71 --> 2568.3
be less driven it doesn't work for me

2564.64 --> 2573.08
because I just get no see I feel no lust

2568.3 --> 2579.1400000000003
absolutely not I just feel disgust so I

2573.08 --> 2584.39
don't know I am courageous that sounds

2579.14 --> 2587.2599999999998
kind of weird look it was a long time

2584.39 --> 2587.2599999999998
ago okay

2590.09 --> 2593.3
[Music]

2596.33 --> 2600.0989999999997
[Music]

2606.319 --> 2613.2889999999998
well at the time to me doing that seemed

2611.339 --> 2614.279
like courageous I was always trying to

2613.289 --> 2618.779
be courageous

2614.279 --> 2623.94
even back then like to be not afraid of

2618.779 --> 2627.289
things so I guess I guess it was courage

2623.94 --> 2627.289
but it was still yeah

2634.85 --> 2641.3199999999997
what does this has to do with whispers

2637.34 --> 2648.05
of creation ha that's a good one right

2641.32 --> 2650.36
so yeah a bit late but everything has to

2648.05 --> 2654.04
do with the whispers of creation the

2650.36 --> 2659.78
whispers of creation are all around us

2654.04 --> 2662.7799999999997
it is the design of all things and the

2659.78 --> 2667.0600000000004
side effect of that design of all things

2662.78 --> 2670.01
and what that tells us when you inquire

2667.06 --> 2674.96
that is the whispers of creation and the

2670.01 --> 2680.03
more you inquire you deeper you look the

2674.96 --> 2685.4900000000002
more you know it is all designed all of

2680.03 --> 2691.19
it nothing can be naturally randomly

2685.49 --> 2693.08
that organized nothing and that is what

2691.19 --> 2694.94
the whispers of creation tell you but

2693.08 --> 2698.18
you can only listen to the whispers of

2694.94 --> 2701.57
creation when it's quiet enough that's

2698.18 --> 2705.64
why I call it whispers only when you're

2701.57 --> 2708.29
not severely distracted by your own [ __ ]

2705.64 --> 2710.6
or your own feeling so it's something in

2708.29 --> 2712.58
your past or some psychological issue

2710.6 --> 2714.5899999999997
like you're in denial of something that

2712.58 --> 2719.67
also if you're in denial about something

2714.59 --> 2722.86
it's blocked or it that gets in the way

2719.67 --> 2722.86
[Music]

2725.369 --> 2728.029
what

2729.29 --> 2741.17
are you talking about Saudi to cousin

2732.02 --> 2745.79
Tino guys you gotta be a little bit more

2741.17 --> 2748.31
careful when you're in conversation when

2745.79 --> 2751.37
you say it stays state things like that

2748.31 --> 2754.13
that you don't just say it

2751.37 --> 2755.69
no you it's better to just specify what

2754.13 --> 2758.03
you're actually mentioning because

2755.69 --> 2759.98
otherwise it could be misinterpreted as

2758.03 --> 2771.65
for example being about something that

2759.98 --> 2776.2400000000002
I'm talking about yeah what are you

2771.65 --> 2779.03
talking about you don't see homosexual

2776.24 --> 2780.77
cats or dogs well that's funny that you

2779.03 --> 2786.4100000000003
mention it because I have seen

2780.77 --> 2791.74
homosexual dogs actually or rather like

2786.41 --> 2796.1
dogs that just don't err differentiate

2791.74 --> 2799.99
really and trust me they have not been

2796.1 --> 2799.99
raised to do that

2807.15 --> 2809.869
right

2830.48 --> 2835.2400000000002
Oh doc Marco you got a p1000 cool

2839.94 --> 2842.9

scientific guest Jesus I don't even want

2856.68 --> 2859.9199999999996
to talk about this I could think of

2859.08 --> 2869.46
something

2859.92 --> 2874.83
ah it's just really you guys have to go

2869.46 --> 2880.77
there is there nothing that holds you

2874.83 --> 2884.63
back why do you go everywhere it's just

2880.77 --> 2884.63
Jesus Christ people

2903.4 --> 2912.38
yeah Lord had started it and you're

2906.17 --> 2914.81
continuing it ajm you know a troll

2912.38 --> 2918.98
saying something stupid and out of play

2914.81 --> 2922.19
is not your cue for literally taking

2918.98 --> 2925.67
that and then repeating that full force

2922.19 --> 2928.16
with the excuse he started it now that's

2925.67 --> 2939.6800000000003
a six year old argument it's not a good

2928.16 --> 2940.5699999999997
reason to do that just say sheesh no I

2939.68 --> 2943.2799999999997
don't mind

2940.57 --> 2946.25
coming up but just don't spiral out of

2943.28 --> 2950.619
control every time with that insane

2946.25 --> 2950.619
stuff you don't do that that's not good

2964.64 --> 2971.93
yeah I don't like bible-bashing either

2971.93 --> 2978.98
attacking people with quotes from the

3038.07 --> 3040.67

3073.65 --> 3087.13
Ares is 106 I I don't think that would

3079.99 --> 3091.4399999999996
match the prophecy really and besides it

3109.78 --> 3114.88
hmm

3112.33 --> 3118.18
why can't we measure the distance to the

3114.88 --> 3121.21
moon Tom Parker well because there is no

3118.18 --> 3129.6699999999996
moon object physically out there

3121.21 --> 3131.65
anywhere to measure a distance to it's

3129.67 --> 3134.35
just a light apparition in relation to

3131.65 --> 3137.64
the observer and only has an apparent

3134.35 --> 3141.37
distance as in what your psychological

3137.64 --> 3143.98
systems for analyzing depth will tell

3141.37 --> 3148.3199999999997
you roughly how far away it seems to be

3143.98 --> 3148.32
there's no physical confirmation of that

Thanksgiving is American I'm Dutch we

3162.31 --> 3170.2599999999998
don't celebrate Thanksgiving here it's

3164.62 --> 3175.68
not about us we do celebrate sinter

3170.26 --> 3175.6800000000003
Klass though like the Dutch version of

3177.6 --> 3187.54
off the fat man from the North Pole and

3180.58 --> 3190.33
our Saint comes from Spain as the story

3187.54 --> 3196.86
goes that's yeah that's something we do

3190.33 --> 3196.86
do but no Thanksgiving here

3201.56 --> 3206.6
I just told you Tom Parker there is no

3203.9 --> 3211.6600000000003
distance to the moon or any of the

3206.6 --> 3211.66
celestial bodies that we see

3216.62 --> 3219.58
mm-hmm

3219.88 --> 3228.1600000000003
right mark colored yeah bisphenol-a tits

3222.37 --> 3232.63
that was figured out pretty early on I

3228.16 --> 3237.25
figured that out in my early awakening

3232.63 --> 3241.8
course in the Alex Jones Show like in

3237.25 --> 3245.14
the early days decade ago roughly and

3241.8 --> 3248.9500000000003
yeah that's true it is I do recognize it

3245.14 --> 3252.04
like plastics you know that's why I use

3248.95 --> 3255.16
just glass you know as much as possible

3252.04 --> 3258.52
even had still a leftover plastic bottle

3255.16 --> 3260.98
and wasn't doing me any good even though

3258.52 --> 3267.0099999999998
it was supposed to be bisphenol A free

3260.98 --> 3270.94
its said on the yeah on the package that

3267.01 --> 3274.44
it was that specifically BPA replaced

3270.94 --> 3274.44
with VPS could be

3280.74 --> 3286.3799999999997
yes I do more colored I'm very well

3283.589 --> 3289.98
aware of all these industrial medical

3286.38 --> 3296.21
implications because I was extremely

3289.98 --> 3296.21
interested like I wanted to know how to

3296.48 --> 3305.609
how to know what is around what to avoid

3300.96 --> 3309.089
in order to have my life last longer and

3305.609 --> 3310.92
with less sickness because otherwise I'd

3309.089 --> 3311.64
just be preoccupied with that nonsense

3310.92 --> 3322.4
all the time

3311.64 --> 3322.4
I don't know minor god I

3328.29 --> 3339.24
I don't think so to be fair but hey

3336.63 --> 3343.4
there so there's weird things around

3339.24 --> 3348.109
Jesus and that there may be two people

3343.4 --> 3352.98
look there is just a lot about the whole

3348.109 --> 3357.5699999999997
historical situation that is weird

3352.98 --> 3359.88
it doesn't undo the whole Bible or

3357.57 --> 3364.26
anything it's just that there yeah it's

3359.88 --> 3368.63
very obvious that not everything is told

3364.26 --> 3368.63
that there are things still or left open

3374.96 --> 3379.13
so yeah that it always just makes me

3377.21 --> 3381.53
think Lea what else was left open when I

3379.13 --> 3383.9
was else was left out well probably a

3381.53 --> 3388.55
lot that doesn't make it our fake it

3383.9 --> 3390.89
just means that it's not the hundred

3388.55 --> 3394.309
percent complete picture if such a thing

3390.89 --> 3396.74
is even technically possible or let's

3394.309 --> 3401.0
just say if it could have been possible

3396.74 --> 3408.68
even just saying that yeah it is what it

3401.0 --> 3411.069
is okay the mind of God it's love to see

3408.68 --> 3416.47
some actual evidence of that

3411.069 --> 3416.47
hey everybody would ya

3425.92 --> 3429.15
watch your video

3445.13 --> 3455.4100000000003
yeah black Israelites I don't like that

3503.59 --> 3514.869
dark-skinned and wooly hair weird but

3509.74 --> 3518.47
did they have black hair then or did

3514.869 --> 3521.77
they have like red hair you know it

3518.47 --> 3525.0699999999997

3521.77 --> 3529.39
something like black skin and and but

3525.07 --> 3531.4900000000002
lighter hair I just look I don't know

3529.39 --> 3533.52
what was around then it's such a long

3531.49 --> 3536.6499999999996
time ago look even in my

3533.52 --> 3541.5099999999998
conceptualizations with what could have

3536.65 --> 3543.609
been like in the post-flood

3541.51 --> 3546.369
age I think it was probably a very crazy

3543.609 --> 3551.2
place in a lot of ways and as I said

3546.369 --> 3554.77
very shortly like yeah then the humans

3551.2 --> 3557.5
try to take control and that's really

3554.77 --> 3559.72
when the whole reversed worlds situation

3557.5 --> 3561.52
came along and the erasing of history

3559.72 --> 3563.3489999999997
that was the humans doing that afterward

3561.52 --> 3567.22
but after the flood there was still a

3563.349 --> 3569.2000000000003
lot of craziness probably and the

3567.22 --> 3571.27
remnants of the Atlantean Empire

3569.2 --> 3574.75
everything resettling probably still

3571.27 --> 3576.7
some Giants around or maybe the opening

3574.75 --> 3579.58
and the closing of certain realms that

3576.7 --> 3582.49
groups went away like the elves went to

3579.58 --> 3585.5499999999997
the die undying lands and then the realm

3582.49 --> 3591.18
closed up who knows what was going on

3585.55 --> 3593.92
back then I'm pretty certain that it was

3591.18 --> 3599.1699999999996
spectacular and mysterious and bizarre

3593.92 --> 3603.099
and that it's not been yeah that no

3599.17 --> 3605.83
complete picture exists anymore or maybe

3603.099 --> 3610.06
it does somewhere very very very deeply

3605.83 --> 3612.15
hidden in some Vatican vault I don't

3610.06 --> 3612.15
know

3616.3 --> 3622.21
yeah you're getting a timeout for that

3618.65 --> 3622.21
that's that's [ __ ]

3625.53 --> 3628.76
[Music]

3632.9 --> 3636.34
[Music]

3653.45 --> 3662.77
horse racing lorry no not so much

3659.09 --> 3665.86
but yeah the the deeper you get the city

3662.77 --> 3668.57
center regions like middle of Europe

3665.86 --> 3671.42
yeah the less room there is for things

3668.57 --> 3675.26
like horse racing I think there probably

3671.42 --> 3677.6
some around here but yeah I can imagine

3675.26 --> 3680.8700000000003
in Finland that's just a lot of space to

3677.6 --> 3684.71
get racetracks going for any kind there

3680.87 --> 3687.68
is like a big racetrack its sound for it

3684.71 --> 3691.55
here but that's like a Formula One

3687.68 --> 3696.1099999999997
racing type thing then it is kind of

3691.55 --> 3698.78
popular and I think that the television

3696.11 --> 3701.06
show presentation of it these days it's

3698.78 --> 3708.1000000000004
very high-tech so I can imagine that

3701.06 --> 3708.1
yeah it is interesting but yeah

3708.35 --> 3711.46
