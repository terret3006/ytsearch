whether today again is gorgeous

123.479 --> 127.64
I'd say even better than yesterday

128.58 --> 133.76000000000002
and it really did also start out this

130.739 --> 133.76
way so

134.22 --> 139.52
let the sunshine meet me this morning as

136.92 --> 139.51999999999998
I woke up

140.98 --> 144.89999999999998
[Music]

142.5 --> 147.78
and yeah there's

144.9 --> 151.37900000000002
less Trail remnants although there have

147.78 --> 154.379
been some I've seen them but just a few

151.379 --> 156.54
and yeah

154.379 --> 159.0
it seems like things are just kind of

156.54 --> 161.099
like spreading out up there

159.0 --> 164.66
so you barely even see it I mean there's

161.099 --> 164.66
a bit of haziness but

165.72 --> 171.78
it's not really uh

168.8 --> 175.62
blocking out the Sun or anything

171.78 --> 177.36
so yeah beautiful sunny day again very

175.62 --> 181.87900000000002
little wind

177.36 --> 181.87900000000002
and very little Cloud covering

183.06 --> 189.599
people are literally like sitting in

186.0 --> 191.519
places outside just in the sun like I

189.599 --> 193.67999999999998
went out for groceries today and I

191.519 --> 196.019
looked around and it just happened oh

193.68 --> 198.06
also apparently there's like some sort

196.019 --> 202.20000000000002
of

198.06 --> 204.42000000000002
Center class and events

202.2 --> 206.39999999999998
at in the city

204.42 --> 208.07999999999998
like I almost couldn't even get to my

206.4 --> 211.92000000000002
destination because it was just all

208.08 --> 213.68
packed with like parents and little kids

211.92 --> 219.67999999999998
with the

213.68 --> 219.68
Pete peten costume costumes and all that

220.739 --> 224.34
but yeah I didn't really stick around to

222.72 --> 227.06
figure out what what that was about

224.34 --> 227.06
exactly

228.06 --> 233.519
I noticed an annoying amount of rainbow

230.819 --> 236.29899999999998
colors being present as well so I was

233.519 --> 236.299
like oh God

236.519 --> 241.37900000000002
I'm not gonna be there anyway

241.62 --> 248.28
hello at least G first in chat PGC net

245.54 --> 251.239
territ 306

248.28 --> 251.239
good to see you

252.299 --> 258.18
it is Sunday the 13th of November 2022.

259.32 --> 262.34
enjoy the movie

262.8 --> 269.58
I watched a little of it but no I did

266.46 --> 271.62
not actually enjoy it all that much

269.58 --> 276.02
it seemed like it was a kind of a

271.62 --> 276.02
documentary thing but it felt

277.32 --> 280.699
it just didn't feel right

281.639 --> 287.639
maybe yeah I was I was not in the right

285.419 --> 288.84
mood for it it seemed though very tense

287.639 --> 291.06
and [ __ ]

288.84 --> 293.82
and yeah I mean

291.06 --> 297.0
I was way too relaxed yesterday

293.82 --> 299.52
English subs May yeah that did help but

297.0 --> 301.32
I didn't really watch it I watched just

299.52 --> 304.62
a little of it and then I realized like

301.32 --> 307.09999999999997
this is not something I can watch now

304.62 --> 307.1
foreign

308.72 --> 313.199
if it was all cloudy and gray and

311.46 --> 314.58
Restless then I probably would have

313.199 --> 316.68
watched it

314.58 --> 319.03999999999996
because it seemed like a very restless

316.68 --> 319.04
movie

320.46 --> 325.62
a documentary

323.1 --> 328.44
about local things there

325.62 --> 330.96
in India

328.44 --> 333.23
right but I do have it it is working and

330.96 --> 337.72999999999996
I will get to it

333.23 --> 337.73
[Music]

339.6 --> 344.94
foreign

341.94 --> 344.94
okay

345.6 --> 350.46000000000004
so it's not really a documentary

347.43 --> 353.45
[Music]

350.46 --> 356.57
it's ah well anyway

353.45 --> 356.57
[Music]

359.639 --> 365.759
thank you for sending me that

362.63 --> 368.84
[Music]

365.759 --> 368.84000000000003

373.22 --> 376.88000000000005
uh let's see

377.82 --> 382.86
yeah lots of stuff yesterday I was not

380.46 --> 386.34
Super Active I have to say I'm in the

382.86 --> 388.259
evening I really was kind of like just

386.34 --> 390.17999999999995
just tired

388.259 --> 391.55
so I didn't get on ball busters either

390.18 --> 394.67900000000003
even though it was live

391.55 --> 394.67900000000003
[Music]

394.919 --> 400.25899999999996
there were like three Hangouts at the

396.72 --> 403.819
same time flat side Dell

400.259 --> 403.819
and ball busters

411.18 --> 414.639
[Music]

420.11 --> 423.92900000000003
[Music]

427.12 --> 434.3
[Music]

429.86 --> 434.3
documentary type movie which is okay

434.34 --> 440.28
uh

436.8 --> 442.5
what if it's not too long there it I I

440.28 --> 444.599
mean it might be interesting

442.5 --> 446.16
I've never really seen a movie like that

444.599 --> 449.11
from like

446.16 --> 452.16
well outside of Europe or America

449.11 --> 455.16
[Music]

452.16 --> 457.86
so if it too has good English subtitles

455.16 --> 460.259
yeah and it's not like two hours or

457.86 --> 462.68
something yeah I I might like to check

460.259 --> 462.68
that out

464.099 --> 469.74
just to kind of see like how you guys

466.44 --> 470.39
out there do that sort of thing

469.74 --> 474.279
thank you

470.39 --> 474.279
[Music]

481.8 --> 484.819
flat side

487.199 --> 491.6
right yeah yeah

489.419 --> 494.80899999999997
he did review that

491.6 --> 494.809
[Music]

496.139 --> 499.74
it's kind of funny like I brought it up

498.599 --> 502.139
and he

499.74 --> 504.90000000000003
I didn't really like show it or anything

502.139 --> 509.0
that I don't typically do that

504.9 --> 509.0
unless I know that the person

509.099 --> 514.62
that made it is literally like in the

512.099 --> 517.58
chat telling me like yeah

514.62 --> 517.58
yeah show this

518.809 --> 521.9689999999999
[Music]

522.599 --> 526.6800000000001
otherwise I'll typically just link to it

525.0 --> 529.74
and then people can watch it there's

526.68 --> 532.6999999999999
themselves but uh

529.74 --> 532.7
yeah so

534.36 --> 539.42
was Artemis supposed to launch yesterday

536.82 --> 539.4200000000001
or not

543.66 --> 547.16
I thought that was like

551.279 --> 557.72
yeah it was even like in the title of

553.56 --> 557.7199999999999
flat Zoid flat Zoid show yesterday

558.779 --> 563.22
right but

560.7 --> 567.48
well since Ballers are not all piling in

563.22 --> 571.08
my chat right now telegram was so wrong

567.48 --> 574.62
look here's the footage it just went off

571.08 --> 577.26
so I kind of take it that yeah my

574.62 --> 578.88
prediction came true again and it didn't

577.26 --> 586.05
come off the ground

578.88 --> 586.05
[Music]

589.65 --> 593.659
[Music]

594.12 --> 597.12
oh

598.62 --> 605.279
all right yet tarot is that what you're

601.56 --> 607.3199999999999
is that the 2611 in 2008 is that the

605.279 --> 609.48
Mumbai Hotel attack

607.32 --> 612.24
because I still remember that from on

609.48 --> 613.44
the news I mean that was a pretty big

612.24 --> 615.54
event

613.44 --> 618.5400000000001
at the time

615.54 --> 622.68
yeah the Mumbai Hotel

618.54 --> 625.0799999999999
yeah I remember that wow

622.68 --> 626.459
2018

625.08 --> 630.12
wait what

626.459 --> 630.1199999999999

640.81 --> 647.0189999999999
[Music]

648.62 --> 654.38
oh right the movie's from 2018. I

651.959 --> 654.38
thought so

672.48 --> 679.46
foreign

674.67 --> 679.4599999999999
[Music]

699.43 --> 704.519
[Music]

700.8 --> 707.779
was meant to be tomorrow what

704.519 --> 707.779
I thought it was yesterday

709.68 --> 714.779
okay whatever it I'm still I'm still

713.1 --> 718.019
predicting it's not coming off the

714.779 --> 721.5
ground ever so but it's gonna be kind of

718.019 --> 724.019
funny like every time to see like oh did

721.5 --> 725.94
I turn them be turned did I turn out to

724.019 --> 728.9590000000001
be wrong after all or

725.94 --> 728.9590000000001
am I right again

729.06 --> 734.3
I mean I only have to call it once it's

731.279 --> 734.3
never coming off the ground

743.399 --> 750.95
anyways hey steemit Traveler

746.02 --> 750.9499999999999
[Music]

757.14 --> 759.8
okay

765.45 --> 770.73
[Music]

782.88 --> 788.48
you should attempt to move in the work

785.279 --> 788.48
wow well

789.6 --> 794.89
I mean that's kind of pointless

791.8 --> 794.89
[Music]

795.48 --> 798.71
but

797.399 --> 801.929
yeah

798.71 --> 801.9290000000001
[Music]

814.2 --> 816.8000000000001
what

818.82 --> 823.82
two hours no come on that's too long

821.579 --> 823.8199999999999
Terry

829.5 --> 834.779
and I'm not really too much into the

832.2 --> 837.26
mood of a thriller

834.779 --> 837.26
thanks

837.959 --> 842.9399999999999
look I'll take a look at the movie you

840.54 --> 846.24
sent me like as soon as the weather

842.94 --> 847.3800000000001
starts getting shitty again or something

846.24 --> 850.019
foreign

847.38 --> 853.5
I mean right now what's really on my

850.019 --> 855.54
agenda for to do things is to just start

853.5 --> 859.019
reading my uh

855.54 --> 861.3
my book from Rudolph Steiner

859.019 --> 864.74
I've already read some of the intro but

861.3 --> 864.74
it's just like yeah

866.1 --> 869.94
but again it's beautiful weather today

868.5 --> 873.899
so

869.94 --> 876.0600000000001
I feel like I could probably get in uh a

873.899 --> 878.88
few more pages

876.06 --> 880.8
and yeah I'm just what I'm mostly

878.88 --> 883.68
nervous about is that when I'm reading

880.8 --> 886.519
it that I'll find it really clunky and

883.68 --> 886.519
hard to get into

887.279 --> 893.399
because I already know so much about

890.1 --> 895.139
like rudel Steiner's mechanisms through

893.399 --> 898.199
my healer especially

895.139 --> 900.6
like a lot of my spirit mechanics is

898.199 --> 902.04
like based on Rudolph Steiner Spirit

900.6 --> 904.62
cosmology

902.04 --> 906.899
yet I've never read actually read a book

904.62 --> 910.8
of his so but I'm really nervous like

906.899 --> 913.38
reading it like I hope it's gonna be not

910.8 --> 914.76
off-putting this happens a lot to me I

913.38 --> 917.16
mean

914.76 --> 919.639
from what I read so far this book was

917.16 --> 919.639
originally

919.94 --> 924.36
written

921.48 --> 927.98
in like 1908

924.36 --> 927.98
that's kind of old

930.36 --> 934.16
anyway

931.05 --> 934.16
[Music]

940.98 --> 947.72
what

943.079 --> 947.7199999999999
okay a low speed reader

954.0 --> 956.48
what

965.16 --> 968.16
foreign

978.32 --> 982.7600000000001
what the hell is that supposed to mean

994.92 --> 999.5999999999999
okay

996.48 --> 1003.5
right well I'm not a speed reader

999.6 --> 1004.779
I'm a very quick writer though I think

1003.5 --> 1008.48
that probably

1004.779 --> 1010.9399999999999
my writing ability using a good keyboard

1008.48 --> 1014.36
my keyboard's kind of like shitty so

1010.94 --> 1016.5790000000001
it's not that great I have to re-type

1014.36 --> 1019.88
keys and [ __ ] all the time

1016.579 --> 1022.279
when it's working fluidly my typing I

1019.88 --> 1024.88
think is probably faster on average than

1022.279 --> 1024.88
my reading

1030.5 --> 1037.579
oh

1032.48 --> 1041.319
oh that guy I think I remember you

1037.579 --> 1041.319
yeah I thought that was kind of weird

1047.12 --> 1053.6
that's like years ago now yeah I don't

1049.76 --> 1055.94
really care dude I mean it you basically

1053.6 --> 1058.36
seem kind of crazy to me and whatever

1055.94 --> 1058.3600000000001
man

1061.03 --> 1068.809
[Music]

1069.44 --> 1074.44
yeah no no you don't know what you're

1072.02 --> 1074.44
talking about

1076.94 --> 1081.98
like reading for me

1079.52 --> 1084.62
I mean a sentence

1081.98 --> 1086.96
I can read very quickly even a small

1084.62 --> 1089.299
blocks of block attacks I can read very

1086.96 --> 1091.52
quickly it's like as I almost read it

1089.299 --> 1094.82
like it's a single icon yeah that works

1091.52 --> 1097.22
but as soon as it's actual pages

1094.82 --> 1098.78
like a big block of text that doesn't

1097.22 --> 1101.24
work like that

1098.78 --> 1104.1789999999999
it becomes a lot more difficult for me

1101.24 --> 1107.98
to read go slower

1104.179 --> 1107.98
requires more concentration

1109.34 --> 1113.78
while

1110.72 --> 1115.88
writing I can literally once it gets

1113.78 --> 1119.539
going it just goes and goes It goes is

1115.88 --> 1122.179
extremely fast I mean really it is I

1119.539 --> 1125.02
write a lot faster than I read

1122.179 --> 1125.02
it is true

1125.9 --> 1132.88
now that is not very typical though of

1129.14 --> 1132.88
course because most people don't

1133.82 --> 1136.059
foreign

1136.4 --> 1143.0
I think with me in particular it's tied

1139.7 --> 1144.679
in with this weird sort of trait that I

1143.0 --> 1146.48
always use to have it's kind of like the

1144.679 --> 1148.5800000000002
blabbermouth trait

1146.48 --> 1150.02
that you can speak faster than you can

1148.58 --> 1154.78
think

1150.02 --> 1158.0
well the way I can do that with typing

1154.78 --> 1159.62
I can type something out

1158.0 --> 1161.84
so fast

1159.62 --> 1164.84
that I literally don't even know what it

1161.84 --> 1166.8799999999999
is I'm typing until I've I'm done and

1164.84 --> 1169.28
then I read what I typed and then I get

1166.88 --> 1173.919
what I just type

1169.28 --> 1173.9189999999999
yeah I'm I'm kind of weird like that

1175.76 --> 1180.82
just the skill yeah whatever man uh why

1178.7 --> 1184.4
don't you leave that [ __ ]

1180.82 --> 1186.08
completely out of my show I'm not

1184.4 --> 1188.96
interested yeah

1186.08 --> 1191.539
you literally started by saying that you

1188.96 --> 1194.24
lied the last time I'm not interested in

1191.539 --> 1196.16
your interest in speed reading please

1194.24 --> 1197.419
[ __ ] off about that if that's what

1196.16 --> 1198.38
you're gonna talk about I'm gonna kick

1197.419 --> 1199.76
you out

1198.38 --> 1200.9
okay

1199.76 --> 1202.16
yeah

1200.9 --> 1204.38
yeah

1202.16 --> 1207.2
this is no longer free ground for

1204.38 --> 1209.0590000000002
weirdos to just start inserting random

1207.2 --> 1210.98
[ __ ] that literally nobody gives you

1209.059 --> 1212.84
[ __ ] about

1210.98 --> 1214.88
okay

1212.84 --> 1217.9399999999998
this is not

1214.88 --> 1221.7800000000002

1250.72 --> 1257.08
yeah reading the book

1253.94 --> 1257.0800000000002
I want to read it

1257.72 --> 1261.6200000000001
but again yeah I'm kind of like worried

1260.12 --> 1264.32
that it's

1261.62 --> 1265.6399999999999
written in a way that I won't find

1264.32 --> 1267.98
appealing

1265.64 --> 1269.72
I mean I'll understand it but I'll like

1267.98 --> 1273.32
I'm worried that I'm gonna constantly

1269.72 --> 1276.38
like get it way too quick and then be

1273.32 --> 1277.52
kind of frustrated with like ninnying or

1276.38 --> 1279.44
something

1277.52 --> 1282.2
which was like would have been typically

1279.44 --> 1284.48
him or that age a way of saying things

1282.2 --> 1286.52
and it would I'm just worried it it'll

1284.48 --> 1288.2
start to disturb me and kind of distract

1286.52 --> 1290.78
me

1288.2 --> 1293.0800000000002
I don't know why I worry about such

1290.78 --> 1293.08
things

1293.12 --> 1299.08
well maybe because it turns out to

1296.059 --> 1299.08
actually happen a lot

1301.7 --> 1304.989
[Music]

1308.26 --> 1314.5
okay are you in English

1311.78 --> 1314.5
Translate

1315.2 --> 1319.659
okay so you actually think in Afrikaans

1320.78 --> 1327.6789999999999
that's weird I don't even think in

1323.179 --> 1331.9
England in Dutch I mean I can but I can

1327.679 --> 1331.9
literally think in English as well

1332.6 --> 1335.5
and I do

1335.98 --> 1341.1200000000001
English is kind of like my mechanical

1339.039 --> 1344.059
internal language

1341.12 --> 1347.4799999999998
more than duchess

1344.059 --> 1351.799
Dutch is much more like a to me a more

1347.48 --> 1354.799
detailed like social communication form

1351.799 --> 1356.5
well the the rudiment the rudimentary

1354.799 --> 1360.62
mechanical

1356.5 --> 1364.94
insights all of that are mostly Guided

1360.62 --> 1367.7199999999998
by English types iconography so that's

1364.94 --> 1367.72
just how I work

1368.38 --> 1372.3200000000002
Africans English

1370.7 --> 1374.8400000000001
a mixture

1372.32 --> 1377.04
okay

1374.84 --> 1380.1499999999999
that sounds very confusing

[Music]

1392.0 --> 1398.5
right I've also been catching up on some

1395.659 --> 1398.5
old Benjamin

1399.88 --> 1404.679
hilarious stuff and interesting

1410.62 --> 1417.6999999999998
apparently had a grow triple seven on

1415.1 --> 1417.6999999999998
but

1417.74 --> 1420.46
yeah

1423.799 --> 1428.48
I just stopped listening I know I know

1426.559 --> 1430.8799999999999
what it is like when they get together

1428.48 --> 1432.8600000000001
and they talk

1430.88 --> 1436.2800000000002
and I know that

1432.86 --> 1437.6589999999999
Owen enjoys it a lot

1436.28 --> 1441.28
well

1437.659 --> 1441.2800000000002
I get annoyed a lot

1447.62 --> 1452.3799999999999
don't Benjamin's Jew song which one

1453.08 --> 1458.72
but yeah there were some really funny

1455.12 --> 1460.8999999999999
little videos with songs and [ __ ] yeah I

1458.72 --> 1460.9
mean

1462.82 --> 1468.86
foreign

1465.46 --> 1471.28
because I've seen multiple in the last

1468.86 --> 1471.28
week

1473.67 --> 1477.009
[Music]

1485.12 --> 1491.059
latest one

1486.919 --> 1494.419
oh oh no I haven't heard it yet but I'm

1491.059 --> 1496.1789999999999
only like 25 minutes in

1494.419 --> 1498.98
I can't wait

1496.179 --> 1501.94
now I really want to finish it and love

1498.98 --> 1501.94
it when he does that [ __ ]

1506.98 --> 1510.71
[Music]

1511.94 --> 1519.98
some people think visually instead yeah

1516.919 --> 1523.8200000000002
well I am one of those people most of

1519.98 --> 1526.7
the time I mean yeah

1523.82 --> 1528.9399999999998
when it's just visual things there is

1526.7 --> 1533.0
really no language

1528.94 --> 1536.679
but as soon as I like turn on operations

1533.0 --> 1539.24
inside of like oh I have to

1536.679 --> 1542.179
communicate this

1539.24 --> 1544.52
then the first language that's actually

1542.179 --> 1547.94
starting to get initiated in that

1544.52 --> 1551.6
process automatically is English

1547.94 --> 1554.24
so again English is like my internal

1551.6 --> 1557.1789999999999
mechanical language

1554.24 --> 1559.82
doesn't mean that I always like actively

1557.179 --> 1561.6200000000001
think English

1559.82 --> 1563.6589999999999
but it's like the first thing that

1561.62 --> 1566.779
starts up

1563.659 --> 1570.0800000000002
but it's it's really because well the

1566.779 --> 1573.4
vast majority now of my spoken

1570.08 --> 1573.3999999999999
communication is English

1573.62 --> 1581.7199999999998
I mean I speak roughly two

1577.4 --> 1584.659
the three hours of English a day

1581.72 --> 1587.6000000000001
guarantee

1584.659 --> 1589.159
well yeah two hours and like in the

1587.6 --> 1591.02
weekdays with the Flat Earth debates

1589.159 --> 1593.8600000000001
right

1591.02 --> 1593.86
well

1594.799 --> 1601.1
per week

1596.24 --> 1605.36
I think I speak about an average of

1601.1 --> 1607.8799999999999
a maximum of one hour of Dutch

1605.36 --> 1612.86
in a week

1607.88 --> 1615.38
so it's not surprising that over time

1612.86 --> 1617.1789999999999
I would start to just adapt more and

1615.38 --> 1619.1000000000001
more to English

1617.179 --> 1621.74
it's only logical

1619.1 --> 1623.9189999999999
because it's now my the majority of my

1621.74 --> 1623.919
language

1624.159 --> 1630.8600000000001
and I've always kind of had that in a

1627.74 --> 1634.46
way because for example I want my

1630.86 --> 1637.299
computer in English always have from the

1634.46 --> 1637.299
start it's like

1637.64 --> 1643.279
yeah like

1640.88 --> 1646.22
the interface should not be Dutch

1643.279 --> 1649.22
language it it just it should not be

1646.22 --> 1652.159
that is like an atrocity to me

1649.22 --> 1652.88
I don't yeah it's a personal thing I

1652.159 --> 1655.4
just

1652.88 --> 1658.1000000000001
a computer should be in English just

1655.4 --> 1660.5
period and that's for me that's just

1658.1 --> 1663.26
what I think that I don't know it

1660.5 --> 1666.44
how that has even come to be

1663.26 --> 1668.62
I just always thought like yeah no the

1666.44 --> 1668.6200000000001
internet

1669.679 --> 1675.02
my desktop and just

1672.919 --> 1676.94
on my computer the technicals it should

1675.02 --> 1678.1399999999999
be English it's just always been like

1676.94 --> 1682.5800000000002
that

1678.14 --> 1685.46
since I first had a like a

1682.58 --> 1688.72
well since I first had my own

1685.46 --> 1688.72
personal computers

1688.94 --> 1693.98
and I had the option like oh you want

1691.58 --> 1695.539
Dutch and like oh no God

1693.98 --> 1698.44
no

1695.539 --> 1698.44
English please

1700.16 --> 1710.23
[Music]

1712.58 --> 1715.58
right

1717.679 --> 1724.039
but that doesn't mean that I actually

1720.26 --> 1727.539
hate or despise Dutch language though

1724.039 --> 1727.539
it's just that I

1730.1 --> 1736.1589999999999
it's like Dutch is like the face-to-face

1733.1 --> 1739.779
speaking language and there is

1736.159 --> 1744.14
I have a more precise

1739.779 --> 1749.659
dynamic range of what I can do even with

1744.14 --> 1752.179
my vocals based on my upgrowing because

1749.659 --> 1755.3200000000002
well still half of my life I've been

1752.179 --> 1755.3200000000002
mostly talking Dutch

1756.86 --> 1764.059
when you grow up with the languages then

1760.279 --> 1766.7
you train your systems with the use of

1764.059 --> 1770.9189999999999
those languages you become very good at

1766.7 --> 1770.919
that naturally and that stays with you

1771.14 --> 1774.679
even though I'm I'm barely speaking it

1773.84 --> 1779.3799999999999
now

1774.679 --> 1779.38
I still have that ability range with it

1780.14 --> 1785.3200000000002
just

1781.659 --> 1785.3200000000002
particularly useful

1786.2 --> 1789.279
I communicate with lady

1789.32 --> 1794.319

1822.22 --> 1825.93
[Music]

1827.659 --> 1833.8990000000001
it's still kind of funny like and I I

1831.44 --> 1836.8990000000001
really oh I I say I guess I've always

1833.899 --> 1839.6589999999999
had a talent for English too

1836.899 --> 1841.399
in a way because well it started very

1839.659 --> 1845.5390000000002
young I mimicked

1841.399 --> 1848.5
English words from the telly

1845.539 --> 1851.96
from the cartoons

1848.5 --> 1854.539
I was like that's such a cool language

1851.96 --> 1857.0
and I just like I don't want to be able

1854.539 --> 1860.12
to like understand it

1857.0 --> 1862.279
and speak it and well

1860.12 --> 1864.3799999999999
it was kind of funny because yeah the

1862.279 --> 1867.62
cartoons back in the day and I'm talking

1864.38 --> 1871.159
like in between when I was like 6 and

1867.62 --> 1873.3799999999999
12. all of the cartoons back then were

1871.159 --> 1875.659
all English cartoons there were there

1873.38 --> 1877.22
were some Dutch spoken cartoons but

1875.659 --> 1881.6000000000001
those were like

1877.22 --> 1885.32
well actually made by Dutch people

1881.6 --> 1887.24
right like European cartoons but there

1885.32 --> 1889.82
were just like a lot of cartoons that

1887.24 --> 1891.679
were typically American

1889.82 --> 1895.279
and they would just have the the

1891.679 --> 1900.5
American spoken dialogues and all that

1895.279 --> 1901.76
but they then put Dutch translations

1900.5 --> 1904.76
like

1901.76 --> 1906.14
under there subtitles standard like in

1904.76 --> 1910.8799999999999
the television

1906.14 --> 1913.76
and yeah that that was like so that was

1910.88 --> 1917.179
basically my first real teacher

1913.76 --> 1920.539
that thing the subtitles like it really

1917.179 --> 1922.52
made me like wow it's both Dutch and

1920.539 --> 1923.48
it's English spoken and just all the

1922.52 --> 1926.12
time

1923.48 --> 1927.98
like and I really wanted to get it a lot

1926.12 --> 1930.5
of the time I wasn't just like oh I

1927.98 --> 1933.32
wouldn't stare at moving pictures and

1930.5 --> 1935.899
hear sounds I wasn't like one of those

1933.32 --> 1938.24
zombie retards like most people I was

1935.899 --> 1940.1589999999999
actually like really interested

1938.24 --> 1942.46
it's like oh what is this oh what are

1940.159 --> 1942.46
they doing

1944.24 --> 1949.82
like like what is like they're talking

1946.82 --> 1952.1
in a way like is this an American way of

1949.82 --> 1953.899
saying things like I picked up on these

1952.1 --> 1956.779
things when it was like a really young

1953.899 --> 1959.36
kid and fascinated by it like I want to

1956.779 --> 1961.76
get that I was very fascinated by

1959.36 --> 1963.799
sayings in general as a little kid it's

1961.76 --> 1965.779
like wow it's just like it doesn't

1963.799 --> 1968.1399999999999
logically make a lot of sense but it's

1965.779 --> 1972.2
like when people say that it just

1968.14 --> 1973.7
resonates with some wider Spirit or

1972.2 --> 1976.5800000000002
something and I've always thought that

1973.7 --> 1977.779
was very fascinating and including with

1976.58 --> 1979.6999999999998
American

1977.779 --> 1982.159
I don't know as much about English

1979.7 --> 1984.14
sayings although I do know some but I do

1982.159 --> 1988.88
well basically because of Television

1984.14 --> 1990.2
exposure know a lot more about American

1988.88 --> 1991.46
right

1990.2 --> 1994.1000000000001
and

1991.46 --> 1996.14
I just wanted to know it and even like

1994.1 --> 2000.1589999999999
in school

1996.14 --> 2001.779
I I was not like a goody goody two-shoes

2000.159 --> 2004.2990000000002
nerd or something that was always

2001.779 --> 2006.58
studying absolutely not I was actually

2004.299 --> 2008.44
kind of trying to be the rebel that was

2006.58 --> 2011.6789999999999
always like

2008.44 --> 2014.74
skipping classes which was pretty very

2011.679 --> 2016.299
doable as long like you didn't nest in

2014.74 --> 2018.22
some phases you didn't necessarily have

2016.299 --> 2019.779
to go as long as you just made the exam

2018.22 --> 2021.94
and all that

2019.779 --> 2024.82
would just be playing Magic the

2021.94 --> 2026.38
Gathering and role-playing games like in

2024.82 --> 2028.779
the in the lobby

2026.38 --> 2031.2990000000002
like all the time

2028.779 --> 2034.179
and I was kind of like a wise ass

2031.299 --> 2036.82
sometimes smoking cannabis secretly

2034.179 --> 2039.22
outside of the school and

2036.82 --> 2042.22
being all high and [ __ ] trying to hide

2039.22 --> 2045.64
it so I was kind of like a bit of

2042.22 --> 2047.98
embarrass dumbass really but I that was

2045.64 --> 2050.379
just my attitude but

2047.98 --> 2052.2400000000002
in English I always loved English class

2050.379 --> 2054.46
and we had like a really awesome

2052.24 --> 2056.6789999999996
interesting English teacher

2054.46 --> 2058.7200000000003
who was like really into Monty Python

2056.679 --> 2062.52
and Blackadder so that was like yeah

2058.72 --> 2065.1389999999997
baby was it the the joy of the day

2062.52 --> 2068.619
literally to go to English class A lot

2065.139 --> 2070.98
of the time but I was also really good

2068.619 --> 2073.8990000000003
at it because with that teacher

2070.98 --> 2077.08
typically wanted you to like Okay so

2073.899 --> 2081.2799999999997
let's start talking English now so and

2077.08 --> 2085.179
then the kids are like uh migrated no no

2081.28 --> 2086.8590000000004
no no speak it in English but I don't

2085.179 --> 2089.44
know how

2086.859 --> 2091.24
I'm not very good at it

2089.44 --> 2094.599
right and then we're obviously like oh

2091.24 --> 2098.4399999999996
because as soon as I got my turn I would

2094.599 --> 2101.2000000000003
literally start talking almost to this

2098.44 --> 2103.48
degree as what I'm doing right now and

2101.2 --> 2107.2
I'm talking like when I'm

2103.48 --> 2107.2
15 16.

2107.98 --> 2114.339
I was just like

2110.5 --> 2117.339
like no I I can actually think and talk

2114.339 --> 2121.14
a complicated English

2117.339 --> 2121.14
yeah I just could

2121.24 --> 2125.68
that's why well I did have like pretty

2124.3 --> 2129.2000000000003
high score

2125.68 --> 2131.859
on English so yeah not surprising

2129.2 --> 2134.3199999999997
[Music]

2131.859 --> 2136.24
I'm just good at it I think I just have

2134.32 --> 2138.4
a natural talent for it

2136.24 --> 2139.8999999999996
and I think it has to do where I know

2138.4 --> 2142.599
even where the talent comes from because

2139.9 --> 2146.2000000000003
it is probably the artistic talent

2142.599 --> 2148.2400000000002
that my especially my mother has mostly

2146.2 --> 2150.24
mental focus and that's why she was a

2148.24 --> 2154.24
teacher

2150.24 --> 2158.16
in it in music my dad also but different

2154.24 --> 2161.0789999999997
different type of mine and

2158.16 --> 2164.14
they have like

2161.079 --> 2167.32
talent for a language both of them they

2164.14 --> 2169.48
never just really were into that

2167.32 --> 2172.7200000000003
because they were more focused on music

2169.48 --> 2175.2400000000002
well I never really hit it off with

2172.72 --> 2178.72
music that well I was always like oh I

2175.24 --> 2181.0
listening yeah listen listen listen a

2178.72 --> 2184.48
freaking this music that music

2181.0 --> 2186.94
what what beauty I loved it when it

2184.48 --> 2189.339
comes to like oh but you can make it too

2186.94 --> 2190.7400000000002
I was like

2189.339 --> 2194.2599999999998
okay okay

2190.74 --> 2196.7799999999997
I'll do it for the family I just didn't

2194.26 --> 2199.8390000000004
really really want to do it I was never

2196.78 --> 2202.9
like yeah music oh man I love making it

2199.839 --> 2204.7
no not really I kind of loved it

2202.9 --> 2206.56
when my parents were doing it because

2204.7 --> 2210.8999999999996
they really loved doing it and they

2206.56 --> 2210.9
would yeah play together even

2211.3 --> 2215.5600000000004
and with other people have other people

2213.64 --> 2218.2
over it because we had our own little

2215.56 --> 2219.88
music studio and sometimes people came

2218.2 --> 2222.7
over and then they just made music they

2219.88 --> 2224.92
just jammed and [ __ ] it was awesome and

2222.7 --> 2226.8999999999996
I mean that was like awesome like people

2224.92 --> 2229.54
would come over with like a saxophone or

2226.9 --> 2233.5
something and then have like a little

2229.54 --> 2235.9
a little Jazz Jam or something piano

2233.5 --> 2239.02
and

2235.9 --> 2242.6800000000003
my daddy yeah guitar bass or something

2239.02 --> 2246.579
it dude it was like pretty awesome I

2242.68 --> 2248.68
loved listening to it I just don't

2246.579 --> 2250.6600000000003
really want to do it I mean I like

2248.68 --> 2253.06
singing

2250.66 --> 2257.2
but

2253.06 --> 2259.06
I like the skill of it I don't like Oh

2257.2 --> 2261.3999999999996
I'm a singer

2259.06 --> 2264.099
I don't like

2261.4 --> 2268.54
public performance with singing

2264.099 --> 2271.54
but I do like or rating yeah I like

2268.54 --> 2274.24
talking I have skills for talking I

2271.54 --> 2277.839
invested a lot of my mental skills in

2274.24 --> 2279.9399999999996
trying to figure out things and making

2277.839 --> 2282.82
them explicable and this has been

2279.94 --> 2284.8
actively trained even by both my brother

2282.82 --> 2288.339
and my mother

2284.8 --> 2291.94
like pre-teen and during my teens a lot

2288.339 --> 2294.099
like where they would drill me over that

2291.94 --> 2296.14
that I would be always be dreaming and

2294.099 --> 2296.98
they'd be like what are you thinking

2296.14 --> 2300.8799999999997
about

2296.98 --> 2302.5
explain it to me make me understand it

2300.88 --> 2304.9
and

2302.5 --> 2306.7
eventually I I like just started doing

2304.9 --> 2309.94
that and because of that I've just

2306.7 --> 2312.64
learned this ability to do that so I've

2309.94 --> 2315.579
always seen it as my O rating and

2312.64 --> 2318.22
explanation skills I kind of started

2315.579 --> 2321.88
using them as well sort of becoming a

2318.22 --> 2324.48
teacher but it is originally rooted the

2321.88 --> 2330.099
talents of it in

2324.48 --> 2333.339
well creative and musical talents

2330.099 --> 2335.92
it's funny isn't that

2333.339 --> 2339.2799999999997
I never really developed like music

2335.92 --> 2343.3
talents except for listening

2339.28 --> 2345.9
but I have just yeah turned my vocal

2343.3 --> 2345.9
skills

2347.02 --> 2352.839
yeah use them instead anyway

2349.56 --> 2354.2799999999997
sorry for rambling on about that

2352.839 --> 2358.0789999999997
I don't know if you guys are interested

2354.28 --> 2358.079
or not it's just backstory

2358.119 --> 2361.02
foreign

2372.599 --> 2377.92
but there's the thing you know

2375.4 --> 2379.06
Brits they

2377.92 --> 2382.2400000000002
like

2379.06 --> 2384.64
a British accent is extremely tenacious

2382.24 --> 2387.16
you can't get rid of it

2384.64 --> 2388.2999999999997
I mean if you're actually like a normal

2387.16 --> 2391.06
Brit

2388.3 --> 2393.579
the amount of training you need to get

2391.06 --> 2395.2
rid of that British accent is just

2393.579 --> 2397.8390000000004
mind-boggling

2395.2 --> 2400.56
that's why most Brits never lose their

2397.839 --> 2400.56
accent ever

2402.099 --> 2406.2400000000002
that's kind of funny because that way

2404.2 --> 2407.0789999999997
you always recognize like oh hey you're

2406.24 --> 2409.06
great

2407.079 --> 2411.1600000000003
because no matter how hard they try to

2409.06 --> 2417.119
fit in and not seem English you could

2411.16 --> 2417.1189999999997
just hear it they can't hide it from us

2418.42 --> 2423.16
hmm

2419.83 --> 2425.8199999999997
[Music]

2423.16 --> 2425.8199999999997
anyway

2427.96 --> 2434.44
wow

2430.48 --> 2436.119
five at five a.m on Sunday wow skeptic

2434.44 --> 2438.579
nine three six that's a lot of

2436.119 --> 2440.859
dedication

2438.579 --> 2443.1400000000003
5 am

2440.859 --> 2445.38
right so you're are you like in

2443.14 --> 2445.3799999999997
California

2446.26 --> 2448.619
or something

2450.22 --> 2454.16
or Washington

2452.68 --> 2457.239
or Alaska

2454.16 --> 2457.239
[Music]

2470.38 --> 2475.32
California right

2473.26 --> 2484.7200000000003
all right all right

2475.32 --> 2486.94
[Music]

2484.72 --> 2489.2799999999997
hmm

2486.94 --> 2492.7000000000003
I wanted to understand the Return of the

2489.28 --> 2497.5
Jedi when it was oh my God

2492.7 --> 2500.859
isn't that a little young Aries 106.

2497.5 --> 2504.7
that's I mean

2500.859 --> 2506.02
Star Wars is is is really like a 12 plus

2504.7 --> 2508.18
movie

2506.02 --> 2510.7
even though they have like the weirdo

2508.18 --> 2512.3199999999997
Droids that that like help out the

2510.7 --> 2515.04
kitties but that's more for a family

2512.32 --> 2515.04
format

2515.2 --> 2518.74
I mean if you're just 10 and you're

2517.24 --> 2521.14
watching it completely by yourself

2518.74 --> 2523.66
that's not healthy it's just way too

2521.14 --> 2526.66
young for that

2523.66 --> 2526.66
foreign

2536.74 --> 2541.359
I think I watched it for the first time

2538.78 --> 2545.3390000000004
when I was like 15.

2541.359 --> 2545.339
yeah I wasn't even that young

2556.06 --> 2561.9
wait what your English wasn't good in

2558.94 --> 2561.9
what Aries

2565.0 --> 2567.9
what the

2568.0 --> 2573.76
okay

2569.28 --> 2576.82
what what's your language then Aries I

2573.76 --> 2578.8590000000004
did not know you were not like native

2576.82 --> 2582.06
English

2578.859 --> 2582.06
it seemed like that

2588.4 --> 2591.28
because there are different Dutch

2589.66 --> 2594.24
accents yes

2591.28 --> 2594.2400000000002
plenty

2598.24 --> 2606.64
yeah no with the whole different accents

2603.46 --> 2609.64
like it is in England we we got that we

2606.64 --> 2612.2999999999997
got that too with our Dutch

2609.64 --> 2612.2999999999997
definitely

2622.0 --> 2626.859
and I mean like as a foreigner you would

2624.94 --> 2628.96
be able to hear it

2626.859 --> 2633.7
I mean if you take

2628.96 --> 2635.98
like a a real local farmer guy from

2633.7 --> 2639.0989999999997
Friesland

2635.98 --> 2644.7400000000002
and you put that next to a

2639.099 --> 2647.56
local farmer guy from brabant or Limburg

2644.74 --> 2649.54
then if they just start talking you'll

2647.56 --> 2652.72
start to hear like whoa those are like

2649.54 --> 2655.06
different sounds coming out of there it

2652.72 --> 2657.3999999999996
really does sound different

2655.06 --> 2660.7599999999998
it's like it's the same language just a

2657.4 --> 2663.42
completely different way of using it

2660.76 --> 2663.42
foreign

2663.64 --> 2667.66
it's really funny but yeah it's it it's

2666.16 --> 2670.3799999999997
very different than the different

2667.66 --> 2670.3799999999997
accents here

2673.34 --> 2677.329
[Music]

2677.38 --> 2682.8
it's funny like even this city has like

2679.96 --> 2682.8
its own accent

2692.61 --> 2696.61
[Music]

2706.42 --> 2711.099
s

2707.579 --> 2713.88
other countries too Belgium yeah but

2711.099 --> 2713.88
they don't really count

2715.119 --> 2718.119
foreign

2718.68 --> 2725.9199999999996
basically Belgium is

2723.76 --> 2727.8390000000004
yeah

2725.92 --> 2730.78
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna get a little

2727.839 --> 2733.72
historically

2730.78 --> 2735.7000000000003
get a little historical I mean we as the

2733.72 --> 2736.7799999999997
Dutch we traditionally diss on the

2735.7 --> 2740.7999999999997
Belgium

2736.78 --> 2744.4
on the belgians yeah we do and that has

2740.8 --> 2748.119
a historical reason mainly because well

2744.4 --> 2751.42
during the 80 year war

2748.119 --> 2753.4
right which is a long time ago

2751.42 --> 2755.44
like at the time where the Dutch

2753.4 --> 2757.599
Republic was actually originally formed

2755.44 --> 2760.42
before it became a kingdom

2757.599 --> 2765.52
yeah there was like Spain the king of

2760.42 --> 2766.96
Spain was like having a a Catholic War

2765.52 --> 2769.48
on us

2766.96 --> 2772.859
and what the hell did my camera just

2769.48 --> 2772.859
freeze son of a [ __ ]

2778.24 --> 2783.4599999999996
right

2779.68 --> 2785.2599999999998
and basically well the Belgium is the

2783.46 --> 2789.099
part

2785.26 --> 2792.119
that basically got overrun

2789.099 --> 2792.119
by Spain

2793.06 --> 2797.619
right

2794.38 --> 2799.7200000000003
so we we like to kind of diss them

2797.619 --> 2802.0
thinking I don't know how many Dutch

2799.72 --> 2803.2799999999997
people even remember this [ __ ] I

2802.0 --> 2806.859
remember it

2803.28 --> 2808.7200000000003
I think of it like this

2806.859 --> 2811.119
it's like yeah but they're Belgium I

2808.72 --> 2814.02
mean they got literally overrun by the

2811.119 --> 2814.02
Vatican pretty much

2814.78 --> 2820.2400000000002
and we we held our ground as Dutch and

2818.56 --> 2823.66
that's the difference between the Dutch

2820.24 --> 2826.4799999999996
and the Belgian see see now where this

2823.66 --> 2828.8799999999997
nonsense tribal issue comes from but it

2826.48 --> 2830.7400000000002
is like a thing and that's also why I

2828.88 --> 2832.3
like to diss a little on geoshifter

2830.74 --> 2835.1189999999997
sometimes

2832.3 --> 2836.98
even though he is absolutely a great

2835.119 --> 2839.46
great guy

2836.98 --> 2839.46
so

2841.78 --> 2849.88
but yeah uh the the northern province

2846.04 --> 2852.7
of Belgium it is flanderen is actually

2849.88 --> 2855.7000000000003
well a ditch Dutch speaking Province

2852.7 --> 2858.0989999999997
although they have like their own

2855.7 --> 2860.5
alteration

2858.099 --> 2862.7200000000003
alteration different words that they use

2860.5 --> 2865.839
here and there

2862.72 --> 2869.339
instead of Dutch

2865.839 --> 2872.74
so in a way it's kind of like yeah

2869.339 --> 2875.859
floundering is in my opinion actually

2872.74 --> 2878.0789999999997
just the most southern province of the

2875.859 --> 2879.819
Netherlands they are literally Dutch

2878.079 --> 2882.1600000000003
spoken

2879.819 --> 2885.22
so

2882.16 --> 2889.18
but they're now yeah the other half is

2885.22 --> 2891.5789999999997
like French spoken so Belgium is like a

2889.18 --> 2894.7
a country

2891.579 --> 2897.579
that's as small as it is is still

2894.7 --> 2899.319
divided with the language barrier I mean

2897.579 --> 2904.119
what the hell man

2899.319 --> 2905.56
call that a country no no

2904.119 --> 2907.6600000000003
but

2905.56 --> 2909.819
as soon as they figure out how

2907.66 --> 2911.74
completely pointless that country is and

2909.819 --> 2914.2599999999998
it's gonna disintegrate after the

2911.74 --> 2917.319
European Union Falls to [ __ ]

2914.26 --> 2919.7200000000003
then I promise that the Netherlands will

2917.319 --> 2922.54
take back flanderen

2919.72 --> 2925.1189999999997
as an as our

2922.54 --> 2927.46
Dutch province that it really is

2925.119 --> 2929.7400000000002
and we won't be discriminating against

2927.46 --> 2932.2
you we'll probably clean up a lot of the

2929.74 --> 2934.1189999999997
mess that is over there which by the way

2932.2 --> 2935.0789999999997
is also because of world of Belgium

2934.119 --> 2937.2400000000002
government

2935.079 --> 2939.7000000000003
like the roads in Belgium are

2937.24 --> 2943.1189999999997
notoriously shitty

2939.7 --> 2946.66
they just don't maintain them terrible

2943.119 --> 2950.44
anyway this is I don't know why it came

2946.66 --> 2953.2599999999998
to this subject but yeah they have their

2950.44 --> 2956.28
own accent of Dutch

2953.26 --> 2956.28
in Belgium

yes of course in U.S movies they

3009.42 --> 3013.92
stereotype the [ __ ] out of everything

3011.28 --> 3016.1400000000003
because that's the only way they can

3013.92 --> 3018.359
make Americans remember that there's

3016.14 --> 3021.7799999999997
countries outside of the United States

3018.359 --> 3023.5789999999997
you see they have to make it as dumb and

3021.78 --> 3025.44
stereotypical as possible because

3023.579 --> 3029.04
otherwise

3025.44 --> 3032.339
the Americans watching will be like wait

3029.04 --> 3034.92
is that another country

3032.339 --> 3036.48
I don't understand

3034.92 --> 3038.16
them

3036.48 --> 3040.319
sorry

3038.16 --> 3044.2999999999997
I think actually that is part of the

3040.319 --> 3044.3
reason why they why they did that a lot

3050.46 --> 3056.2200000000003
because just the United States public is

3053.099 --> 3058.1400000000003
just so incredibly inept in figuring out

3056.22 --> 3060.66
that there's other countries in the

3069.54 --> 3075.96

if they actually hold up and not are not

3087.119 --> 3093.48
secretly like total hypocrites

3090.48 --> 3096.059
right if they actually uphold it that's

3093.48 --> 3098.46
freaking awesome that's like a sort of a

3096.059 --> 3101.0400000000004
British Paladin or something

3098.46 --> 3103.7
in a different way it's like a very

3101.04 --> 3103.7
British thing

yeah anyway

3127.92 --> 3133.2000000000003
right but by the way it's not entirely

3129.96 --> 3136.859
true though PJ CNET they are leaking in

3133.2 --> 3139.2599999999998
other stereotypes of English now too

3136.859 --> 3143.52
I mean you have the

Shady Street Thug accent

3143.52 --> 3147.599
um

3145.099 --> 3151.02
sorry I can't do that properly it's like

3147.599 --> 3154.8590000000004
you know that the like overly British

3151.02 --> 3157.02
problems so early yeah well you got that

3154.859 --> 3159.02
too there's like that sort of [ __ ] is

3157.02 --> 3162.599
like there's several different

3159.02 --> 3165.66
stereotypes of exaggerated English type

3162.599 --> 3168.2400000000002
characters now in American media you've

3165.66 --> 3170.3599999999997
got to recognize that

but yeah Americans love their

3189.059 --> 3193.38
stereotypes

3191.099 --> 3195.119
that way they can still remember that

3193.38 --> 3196.5
there's other countries beside their own

3195.119 --> 3200.2400000000002
in the world

3196.5 --> 3200.24
I mean they really need that reminder

3205.5 --> 3211.5
I mean did you know that if you ask the

3209.16 --> 3213.74
average person on the street in

3211.5 --> 3213.74
California

3214.859 --> 3221.2799999999997
about the Netherlands

3218.76 --> 3223.26
that they would say that they would

3221.28 --> 3225.8390000000004
basically if you gave them multiple

3223.26 --> 3226.8590000000004
options that they would that some of

3225.839 --> 3229.7999999999997
them

3226.859 --> 3233.5789999999997
would just say that the Netherlands

3229.8 --> 3235.1400000000003
would be the capital city of Amsterdam

3233.579 --> 3239.28
okay

3235.14 --> 3243.2999999999997
and I mean only an American and I really

3239.28 --> 3246.6600000000003
mean that only an American would be that

3243.3 --> 3249.78
alien form and incompetent

3246.66 --> 3253.5589999999997
about it because ask pretty much any

3249.78 --> 3256.26
other country in the world

3253.559 --> 3259.5
and I mean even countries that aren't

3256.26 --> 3262.7400000000002
even English spoken at all

3259.5 --> 3266.339
and they will get that right

3262.74 --> 3268.2599999999998
they will know that no Amsterdam is the

3266.339 --> 3270.2
capital city of Amsterdam I mean it's

3268.26 --> 3272.96
it's like a basic International

3270.2 --> 3275.64
topography they'll get that right yeah

3272.96 --> 3278.819
Americans don't

3275.64 --> 3282.1189999999997
they are exceptionally terrible at

3278.819 --> 3284.339
topography when it concerns territory

3282.119 --> 3288.859
besides the United States

3284.339 --> 3288.859
they're exceptionally terrible at it

3306.0 --> 3309.0
right

3311.48 --> 3317.16

3314.64 --> 3318.5
doesn't mean that all Americans are just

3317.16 --> 3319.859
always stupid though

3318.5 --> 3322.68

3319.859 --> 3325.74
there are some that are extremely weeny

3325.74 --> 3331.0789999999997
are very

3328.319 --> 3336.3
like competent

3331.079 --> 3339.7200000000003

3336.3 --> 3343.2000000000003
people that are usually kind of loners

3339.72 --> 3346.14
right I mean there's all kinds but on

3343.2 --> 3349.2599999999998
average it is true it has to be said

3346.14 --> 3352.46
that Americans are probably one of the

3349.26 --> 3354.96
worst at International topography

3352.46 --> 3356.52
compared to every other country in the

3354.96 --> 3358.98
world

3356.52 --> 3361.88
I know maybe except Somali or something

3358.98 --> 3364.619
like I don't know

3361.88 --> 3365.4500000000003

3364.619 --> 3369.13
saying

3365.45 --> 3369.1299999999997
[Music]

3375.42 --> 3383.579
or maybe this was like a 2010

3379.92 --> 3386.88
thing maybe it's changed since then

3383.579 --> 3389.94
but I have not actually seen it change

3386.88 --> 3391.7200000000003
so I'm still going to assume it's still

3389.94 --> 3399.02
like that

3391.72 --> 3399.02
[Music]

3404.88 --> 3409.98
I like kiwi the Americans I used to

3407.64 --> 3412.98
imagine would be like yeah kiwi is just

3409.98 --> 3415.94
straight out of a GI Joe series

3412.98 --> 3415.94
resulting

3419.839 --> 3424.92
except a smart one which is kind of

3422.7 --> 3429.24
contradictive of course with GI Joe

3424.92 --> 3429.2400000000002
which is kind of dumb but

3429.48 --> 3432.559
I know what you mean

3440.46 --> 3447.66
it would be kind of hilarious in a way

3444.9 --> 3449.94
nah this is getting ridiculous

3447.66 --> 3453.359
I was just thinking of like having like

3449.94 --> 3456.3
Transformers G1 and then a modification

3453.359 --> 3458.52
but this is more like a dream thing that

3456.3 --> 3460.619
could happen where you have like QE the

3458.52 --> 3462.78
Transformer and it's actually with his

3460.619 --> 3464.1600000000003
voice and he's like one of the Autobots

3462.78 --> 3466.5
and it's just

3464.16 --> 3469.2
having to deal with how freaking simple

3466.5 --> 3471.119
everybody talks in that series

3469.2 --> 3474.4199999999996
I mean you would probably get very

3471.119 --> 3476.339
frustrated but yeah we know what you eat

3474.42 --> 3479.96
getting frustrated I don't know this is

3476.339 --> 3479.96
like a fantasy growing out of control

3480.119 --> 3483.119
uh

3488.52 --> 3492.559
yeah kiwi Transformer

3492.9 --> 3497.52
I mean he would the voice he would make

3495.599 --> 3499.7400000000002
a great Transformer

3497.52 --> 3502.859
you know

3499.74 --> 3503.7
the idea has the voice for it it's just

3502.859 --> 3506.52
that

3503.7 --> 3508.98
oh he also has like The Cheeky character

3506.52 --> 3512.04
which on average in Transformers

3508.98 --> 3515.94
everybody is like a little dumbed down

3512.04 --> 3518.04
right and he would really then contrast

3515.94 --> 3522.78
with that and that would make it really

3518.04 --> 3524.94
weird but funny so yeah I'm kind of

3522.78 --> 3527.7200000000003
imagining now kiwi having his own

3524.94 --> 3527.7200000000003
transformer

3534.9 --> 3539.299
he would make it a great Transformer

3536.88 --> 3539.299
indeed

3546.78 --> 3552.7200000000003
maybe he could like turn into a a sports

3550.38 --> 3553.619
bow or something I think he'd appreciate

3552.72 --> 3557.8999999999996
that

3553.619 --> 3557.9
fee would be a bow Transformer

3557.94 --> 3562.5
but a really big one of course kind of

3560.28 --> 3565.1600000000003
like Megatron but a bow and on the

I take it it's this one Tony Whitcomb

3686.24 --> 3689.49
[Music]

3691.38 --> 3697.339
actually would be great transforming

3693.42 --> 3697.339
they let him use his own script yeah

3701.599 --> 3707.339
you know what Kiwi would make a great

3704.66 --> 3710.339
replacement character

3707.339 --> 3712.619
for perceptor remember the microscope

3710.339 --> 3715.02
the one that's actually supposed to be

3712.619 --> 3717.78
intelligent but is like really modest

3715.02 --> 3721.079
like the modest intelligent British

3717.78 --> 3723.599
voice I mean I kind of like perceptor it

3721.079 --> 3725.1600000000003
was always underappreciated it's like oh

3723.599 --> 3727.1400000000003
that is blah blah blah blah and

3725.16 --> 3728.94
everybody's like sorry we don't

3727.14 --> 3731.339
understand and I'm like yeah I totally

3728.94 --> 3734.42
understand I mean you you Transformers

3731.339 --> 3734.42
are [ __ ] dumb

3735.24 --> 3740.3999999999996
but it would be kind of funny to maybe

3738.42 --> 3742.799
like do a sort of a

3740.4 --> 3744.599
if kiwi ever thinks of doing this I

3742.799 --> 3747.079
don't know if this might be a little too

3744.599 --> 3750.7200000000003
silly but he could do like almost like a

3747.079 --> 3753.299
Juggernaut [ __ ] type

3750.72 --> 3755.4599999999996
video voice over

3753.299 --> 3760.5
we're just taking a Transformer episode

3755.46 --> 3762.299
and just you putting his voice

3760.5 --> 3763.98
you have to you would have to record it

3762.299 --> 3766.68
carefully

3763.98 --> 3768.48
to like yeah match preceptor and then

3766.68 --> 3770.339
like make a different scene out of it

3768.48 --> 3772.559
kind of like the Juggernaut [ __ ] or

3770.339 --> 3774.66
something I don't know this is getting

3772.559 --> 3778.8190000000004
really weird

3774.66 --> 3778.819

3779.04 --> 3784.4
and he's probably not going to do it

3780.72 --> 3784.3999999999996
either but it could be done

3790.099 --> 3793.4
that's it

3807.66 --> 3812.16
and Nigel wiped the floor on the Big

3810.0 --> 3814.02
Bang okay good on him

3812.16 --> 3817.5789999999997
are you saying that he's like flat

3814.02 --> 3817.579
earther or Flat Earth adjacent

3818.94 --> 3822.38
or is he like a

3822.599 --> 3830.059
a NASA skeptic

3826.14 --> 3830.0589999999997
has he ever addressed the moon landings

3851.55 --> 3854.76
[Music]

3858.5 --> 3862.799
no that's a that's a funny one PJ seen

3861.42 --> 3865.38
it

3862.799 --> 3867.9
even officially for the big bank to work

3865.38 --> 3870.0
the universe has to be expanding faster

3867.9 --> 3872.52
than the speed of light

3870.0 --> 3874.079
Cosmic inflation

3872.52 --> 3878.18
yeah

3874.079 --> 3878.1800000000003
but it's all relative though

3878.88 --> 3883.76
I mean is it really moving at the speed

3881.339 --> 3883.7599999999998
of light

3884.46 --> 3889.26
or is that just

3886.5 --> 3892.44
in relation to something

3889.26 --> 3895.079
slightly next to it or or much further

3892.44 --> 3898.92
away right because that's becomes

3895.079 --> 3901.6800000000003
an issue too like where is something

3898.92 --> 3904.079
really what is the euclidean reality in

3901.68 --> 3906.299
an ever-expanding universe

3904.079 --> 3908.1600000000003
is this not this is actually a serious

3906.299 --> 3910.859
question

3908.16 --> 3912.8999999999996
a philosophical question for the

3910.859 --> 3918.359
heliocentric universe

3912.9 --> 3922.5
like what is actually euclidean reality

3918.359 --> 3926.22
what is really the thing that's moving

3922.5 --> 3928.619
right and one of the very sloppy lazy

3926.22 --> 3930.54
solutions to that question is uh it's

3928.619 --> 3933.299
all relative so nothing is actually

3930.54 --> 3936.42
moving at the speed of light

3933.299 --> 3940.28
it's just in relation to something else

3936.42 --> 3940.28
it may seem like it is

3940.8 --> 3944.1090000000004
[Music]

3950.78 --> 3955.92
yeah of course that doesn't actually

3953.579 --> 3959.94
work in physical reality because there

3955.92 --> 3959.94
is a euclidean exactness

3960.18 --> 3965.52
right things are in very specific

3962.7 --> 3968.5789999999997
positions and when they are there they

3965.52 --> 3971.88
are still non-moving and everything else

3968.579 --> 3974.94
that moves in relation to that is moving

3971.88 --> 3977.579
and that's how it really works

3974.94 --> 3980.54
there's not nothing that is stationary

3977.579 --> 3984.98
is secretly moving at

3980.54 --> 3984.98
astronomical speeds in some way

3986.16 --> 3990.0
right

3987.599 --> 3992.1600000000003
because if it would actually be moving

3990.0 --> 3995.76
at astronomical speeds then that

3992.16 --> 3997.859
astronomical speed would literally cause

3995.76 --> 4000.26
the matter itself

3997.859 --> 4002.0589999999997
to basically start vibrating to the

4000.26 --> 4004.579
point where it's going to disintegrate

4002.059 --> 4007.28
into absolutely nothing

4004.579 --> 4011.44
from the sheer energy

4007.28 --> 4011.44
of it moving that fast

4020.18 --> 4022.7799999999997
right

4023.0 --> 4028.52
and that's why in Star Trek you need

4025.28 --> 4030.44
warp Fields you need a feel to protect

4028.52 --> 4033.5
yourself your ship as you're going

4030.44 --> 4036.819
faster than light speed

4033.5 --> 4039.92
because yeah the main material would

4036.819 --> 4041.839
theoretically just Buckle under the

4039.92 --> 4045.02
energy of it

4041.839 --> 4047.96
of the movement the actual movement

4045.02 --> 4049.64
right but yeah if you then come to the

4047.96 --> 4051.44
conclusion like oh wait what's the

4049.64 --> 4053.359
entire universe is expanding and this

4051.44 --> 4056.299
means that one thing over there in that

4053.359 --> 4057.799
giant universe is moving so fast in

4056.299 --> 4059.66
relation to something else that is

4057.799 --> 4061.28
beyond light speed and doesn't make any

4059.66 --> 4063.2
sense anymore well that's the point

4061.28 --> 4064.6400000000003
where you say it's all relative don't

4063.2 --> 4067.4199999999996

that Transformer saying book or eating

4134.48 --> 4139.239
crayon muncher oh that would be amazing

4139.339 --> 4141.94
but

4142.1 --> 4147.14
maybe you would do better like

4145.339 --> 4148.64
what I don't even remember what's that

4147.14 --> 4150.7390000000005
name again

4148.64 --> 4153.5
not the perceptor one

4150.739 --> 4155.239
there's like this

4153.5 --> 4158.0
uh

4155.239 --> 4160.639999999999
Transformer that like turns into a Jeep

4158.0 --> 4164.6
or something like a military Jeep but

4160.64 --> 4166.279
not the Decepticon from the uh yeah from

4164.6 --> 4169.759
the

4166.279 --> 4171.7390000000005
the one that turned into Devastator

4169.759 --> 4174.08
but like on the Transformer side like

4171.739 --> 4176.7789999999995
the dark green

4174.08 --> 4179.48
type Jeep figure I mean that would make

4176.779 --> 4181.88
a great QE

4179.48 --> 4184.5199999999995

oh

4206.96 --> 4212.6

funny to me to have QE voice in some way

4240.92 --> 4245.78
of course

4242.719 --> 4248.4800000000005
everything in the universe is cyclical

4245.78 --> 4250.46
otherwise it would not be Eternal it has

4248.48 --> 4251.78
to be Eternal because it was always

4250.46 --> 4255.26
there

4251.78 --> 4257.599999999999
of it's gonna be always there right so

4255.26 --> 4260.2390000000005
of course the big bang is basically like

4257.6 --> 4263.96
an engine it's Boom the universe exists

4260.239 --> 4266.599999999999
it starts to expand and then it stops

4263.96 --> 4269.2390000000005
and then it starts Contracting again

4266.6 --> 4271.280000000001
until like black holes basically start

4269.239 --> 4274.239
sucking it all up until it becomes one

4271.28 --> 4274.239
black hole and then it's

4274.28 --> 4283.34
and then boom it starts over again I

4277.58 --> 4286.4
mean duh do I even have to say duh

4283.34 --> 4289.1
what the hell else

4286.4 --> 4291.5
what do you think it's just one boom and

you got it

4813.199 --> 4817.759999999999

4814.94 --> 4819.4

no don't say that

4852.56 --> 4860.7390000000005
I don't I don't think akumo is a

4855.92 --> 4860.7390000000005
a vector I really hope for him he's not

4864.679 --> 4870.8
but look I I actually despite how

4868.64 --> 4873.02
[ __ ] annoying he is sometimes I kind

4870.8 --> 4877.76
of like a kumu virus

4873.02 --> 4880.9400000000005
but not when he goes for Marxist and

4877.76 --> 4882.38
does project the [ __ ] out of every word

4880.94 --> 4883.58
that comes past

4882.38 --> 4885.7390000000005
I

4883.58 --> 4887.659
part I [ __ ] hate him that makes me

4885.739 --> 4889.82
just want to push him off a building or

4887.659 --> 4893.42
something

4889.82 --> 4895.88
but when he doesn't do that I think he's

4893.42 --> 4900.34
actually kind of entertaining and

4895.88 --> 4900.34
dare I say it even kind of smart

4904.58 --> 4911.179
now of course

4906.199 --> 4914.0
not gonna get kiwi or anybody Nathan to

4911.179 --> 4917.21
agree with that but hey

4921.52 --> 4927.1990000000005

to go

4927.199 --> 4933.379999999999
no more don't do that

4930.38 --> 4935.179
it doesn't work it's just agitating it

4933.38 --> 4936.32
just makes us want to kick you in the

4935.179 --> 4938.36
face

4936.32 --> 4941.299999999999
and if you keep it up

4938.36 --> 4944.36
then you will be banned and literally

4941.3 --> 4947.08
nobody will listen to you again so don't

4944.36 --> 4947.08
do that anymore

4949.76 --> 4958.13
[Music]

4959.179 --> 4961.659
oh

4962.179 --> 4967.3
yeah but there it rumpus is just so

4965.0 --> 4967.3
funny

4970.64 --> 4976.04
I still disagree that rumpus was banned

4973.04 --> 4981.32
and yes he is a totally disgusting piece

4976.04 --> 4984.199
of [ __ ] I get it but he's so funny

4981.32 --> 4986.42
and I mean if he's really if he just

4984.199 --> 4989.659
goes overboard he's not funny you just

4986.42 --> 4991.76
kick him out of the room right

4989.659 --> 4993.739
put him on mute

4991.76 --> 4997.84
I don't have doesn't have to be gone

4993.739 --> 4997.839999999999
forever I mean he's so funny

4998.6 --> 5003.280000000001
and I wonder if he even realizes how

5001.0 --> 5004.9
funny he is probably not

5003.28 --> 5007.719
but it's because he's so freaking

5004.9 --> 5009.04
serious about what he does and it's just

5007.719 --> 5011.88
so funny

5009.04 --> 5011.88
uh

5019.9 --> 5024.4
he's a clever trouble yeah no rumpus is

5022.36 --> 5027.04
a total bastard

5024.4 --> 5028.9
total I mean he is mastered that

5027.04 --> 5031.48
projection [ __ ] that I just talked about

5028.9 --> 5033.219
he's a master of that but it it doesn't

5031.48 --> 5035.62
matter because he's just so just so

5033.219 --> 5037.12
funny it's like no matter how bad he

5035.62 --> 5041.159
gets it just

5037.12 --> 5041.159
I can't get that smile off my face

5041.38 --> 5045.9400000000005
like even when he just tells me I'm a

5044.38 --> 5047.62
total piece of [ __ ] like when I'm

5045.94 --> 5050.0199999999995
literally on the same panel or something

5047.62 --> 5052.0
and he's done that where I'd be like oh

5050.02 --> 5053.9800000000005
come on

5052.0 --> 5055.78
don't do that and he'd be like hey

5053.98 --> 5058.0599999999995
you're total [ __ ] you don't know what

5055.78 --> 5061.139999999999
you're talking about you're an idiot you

5058.06 --> 5063.9400000000005
need to get an education and then like

5061.14 --> 5067.2390000000005
it makes me laugh I just think it's so

5063.94 --> 5070.08
funny I can't help it I can't stop

5067.239 --> 5070.08
thinking he's funny

5070.42 --> 5073.26
so it's different

5074.98 --> 5079.239
okay

5076.719 --> 5081.64

Dictionary there so

5387.84 --> 5391.84
oh man

5393.04 --> 5399.28
by the way that sunlight goes away very

5395.98 --> 5402.48
quickly eventually it sucks like it goes

5399.28 --> 5402.48
under so early

5409.719 --> 5414.46
and I miss it every time it happens I

5412.12 --> 5416.62
mean I'm really really loving this so

5414.46 --> 5418.84
maybe I should just figure out how to

5416.62 --> 5421.36
like go to bed really early so that it

5418.84 --> 5423.46
just can get as much of it as I possibly

5421.36 --> 5426.5599999999995
can because

5423.46 --> 5429.679

yeah it is did you see that

5498.219 --> 5503.38
but it is it is kind of like these types

5500.98 --> 5506.199
of more winter periods that make me wish

5503.38 --> 5509.139
that I had like a tower

5506.199 --> 5511.839999999999
like when that that's a lot higher

5509.139 --> 5514.719
so that I can like still keep catching

5511.84 --> 5517.06
sunlight even when it's evening and

5514.719 --> 5519.3
everything is already dark everywhere

5517.06 --> 5519.3
else

5523.54 --> 5528.639
are we pretty

5525.82 --> 5531.759999999999
pretty badass

5528.639 --> 5533.9800000000005
I guess being a wizard it's only natural

5531.76 --> 5537.0
that I'm starting to long for wizard

5533.98 --> 5537.0
towers and all that

5540.159 --> 5544.78
by the way they actually in the city

5542.32 --> 5547.54
here they there's like a

5544.78 --> 5549.88
all kinds of old things there was like

5547.54 --> 5553.56
this water tower that apparently they

5549.88 --> 5553.56
have converted into an apartment

5553.659 --> 5560.679
so that is almost like a wizard tower

5558.46 --> 5563.38
almost

5560.679 --> 5567.3
and it is it is sticking out pretty high

5563.38 --> 5567.3
above all the other buildings so

5567.46 --> 5571.659
I don't know but it's going to be very

5569.26 --> 5574.2390000000005
expensive that thing but it that seems

5571.659 --> 5576.4
pretty badass

5574.239 --> 5579.638999999999
but it's gonna be freaking expensive

5576.4 --> 5583.08
this is like one of those

5579.639 --> 5583.08
Egypt buildings

5589.719 --> 5593.92
I'm down for the whole wizard tower

5591.639 --> 5596.26

5596.26 --> 5600.2390000000005
well I want to build a Wizard Tower

5600.94 --> 5607.599999999999
I don't really but I I wanted to say I

5604.42 --> 5611.08
have blueprints because I've drawn a few

5607.6 --> 5614.76
wizard towers in my day

5611.08 --> 5614.76
never actually built one though

5694.0 --> 5696.179

5988.78 --> 5995.159
two and a half pages

5992.02 --> 5995.159000000001
in the first one

5996.76 --> 6002.219
I could literally spend an hour just

5999.46 --> 6005.34
reading this thing like the history of

6002.219 --> 6008.34
this one campaign that I wrote Because I

6005.34 --> 6010.9800000000005
really wrote so much history for this

6008.34 --> 6012.659000000001
one campaign that never really even came

6010.98 --> 6015.379999999999
off the ground

6012.659 --> 6015.379999999999
properly

6016.56 --> 6022.679
oh my God

6018.6 --> 6024.9800000000005
oh my God this is [ __ ] 10 pages Jesus

6022.679 --> 6028.219
Christ what the hell

6024.98 --> 6028.218999999999
holy [ __ ]

6029.46 --> 6034.38
this

6030.9 --> 6036.96
yeah well here's the creation story of

6034.38 --> 6039.06
this entire world literally the creation

6036.96 --> 6042.78
of the new world

6039.06 --> 6043.92
like this is the Genesis of this entire

6042.78 --> 6046.0199999999995
place

6043.92 --> 6050.84
and it's

6046.02 --> 6050.84
oh oh sorry it's only eight pages

6053.94 --> 6061.879999999999
this could be me yeah I'm sure it could

6056.76 --> 6061.88
it's just that this is what I make

6062.1 --> 6066.06
and

6064.139 --> 6069.42
I don't think I can make anything

6066.06 --> 6073.4400000000005
exactly like this again because this is

6069.42 --> 6075.96
like so much time that I spent just

6073.44 --> 6078.0
just on this

6075.96 --> 6082.139
this took me

6078.0 --> 6084.54
like 10 10 000 hours maybe this is by

6082.139 --> 6087.7390000000005
the way before I even started to make my

6084.54 --> 6091.26
own books oh oh of course of course yes

6087.739 --> 6092.718999999999
oh this is the history

6091.26 --> 6094.8
of

6092.719 --> 6097.56
one city

6094.8 --> 6102.719
eight pages

6097.56 --> 6105.02
freaking Eight Pages of one city

6102.719 --> 6108.86
what the [ __ ]

6105.02 --> 6108.860000000001
I can't believe this

6109.86 --> 6112.94
oh my God

6115.98 --> 6118.98
no

6120.8 --> 6124.820000000001

this is like the Dwarven record of

6127.86 --> 6132.9
Norden

6129.36 --> 6135.299999999999
this is like the Dwarven history it's

6132.9 --> 6136.739
only four pages but it did have like

6135.3 --> 6139.92
this giant

6136.739 --> 6142.739
underground situation like this is the

6139.92 --> 6145.1990000000005
under map you can even see remnants of

6142.739 --> 6148.619
well this is that City I just talked

6145.199 --> 6151.138999999999
about Gulfport or that City that had

6148.619 --> 6154.5599999999995
eight pages

6151.139 --> 6155.18
this map you might recognize it

6154.56 --> 6158.879000000001
thank you

6155.18 --> 6158.879
[Music]

6160.199 --> 6163.349999999999

6163.35 --> 6166.689
[Music]

6168.8 --> 6174.0
yeah thanks I will check my PayPal by

6171.659 --> 6175.799999999999
the way don't worry about that

6174.0 --> 6177.42
right but I just wanted to compare this

6175.8 --> 6178.4400000000005
so

6177.42 --> 6181.32
right

6178.44 --> 6184.32
so you have this

6181.32 --> 6186.219999999999
this is the Overworld map

6184.32 --> 6187.88
see

6186.22 --> 6191.159000000001
[Music]

6187.88 --> 6192.84
Siri that big city so

6191.159 --> 6197.879999999999
Lake

6192.84 --> 6200.719
Hill Country the wizard tower is uh

6197.88 --> 6200.719
over there

6200.88 --> 6205.5
mountainous areas

6203.1 --> 6207.89
right and then

6205.5 --> 6210.139
hey what is it

6207.89 --> 6214.08
[Music]

6210.139 --> 6216.56
this is what's underneath it

6214.08 --> 6216.5599999999995
see

6218.699 --> 6221.699
foreign

6221.88 --> 6227.1
[Music]

6224.76 --> 6229.56
so we may see that there's like the same

6227.1 --> 6231.780000000001
cities over there as over there

6229.56 --> 6234.38
so this is actually what is underneath

6231.78 --> 6234.38
all of that

6234.48 --> 6236.959999999999
pretty big

6237.96 --> 6240.679

[Music]

6248.46 --> 6251.46

6292.699 --> 6298.32
by the way every piece of text is really

6295.5 --> 6300.42
dry so this is not like oh I'm making it

6298.32 --> 6302.28
litter you know this is just like this

6300.42 --> 6303.84
happened then that happened this is why

6302.28 --> 6305.34
they did that that's why that this is

6303.84 --> 6306.900000000001
what proceeded to happen that happened

6305.34 --> 6309.0
that happened

6306.9 --> 6309.599999999999
that's kind of how it's written it's

6309.0 --> 6311.159
really dry

6309.6 --> 6315.3
[Music]

6311.159 --> 6318.199
yet it's still freaking eight pages for

6315.3 --> 6318.1990000000005
one city

6319.26 --> 6322.159000000001
uh

6326.179 --> 6334.02
maybe maybe one day I'll just like

6331.139 --> 6335.9400000000005
read it all out or something maybe

6334.02 --> 6339.780000000001
anyway

6335.94 --> 6341.04
copyright a real realm win

6339.78 --> 6343.92
foreign

6341.04 --> 6346.08
yeah anyway thanks for the PayPal I'll

6343.92 --> 6348.78
check it right now

6346.08 --> 6350.46
I can't seriously I was just shocked I

6348.78 --> 6353.88
just wanted to show you the wizard tower

6350.46 --> 6357.2390000000005
then I realized holy [ __ ] there's like

6353.88 --> 6361.28
40 pages of text here

6357.239 --> 6361.28
and they barely even remember that

6361.619 --> 6365.938999999999
ugh

6362.41 --> 6365.939
[Music]

6375.84 --> 6381.78
oh thank you Tony that's awesome yes

6382.08 --> 6387.9
thank you very much for the PayPal

6384.84 --> 6389.400000000001
that's going to be very helpful

6387.9 --> 6391.32
and this week I'm going to be doing

6389.4 --> 6394.638999999999
pretty well I think

6391.32 --> 6394.639
yeah I'm pretty sure I will

6398.119 --> 6402.0199999999995
to thank you for the support

6404.52 --> 6409.38
all right I hope everything was kind of

6406.92 --> 6413.46
visible even though yeah I don't really

6409.38 --> 6415.679
show It On full screen or anything

6413.46 --> 6418.56
ah

6415.679 --> 6420.54
I just can't believe how much work I put

6418.56 --> 6424.320000000001
into that

6420.54 --> 6427.139
then again I never really and you gotta

6424.32 --> 6431.96
realize that right and I will be honest

6427.139 --> 6431.96
about it I never really like had a job

6433.739 --> 6438.5
like that

6435.54 --> 6442.159
this so This has basically been my

6438.5 --> 6442.159
artwork production

6445.679 --> 6450.6
so

6447.06 --> 6454.080000000001
it does explain why it's so much because

6450.6 --> 6456.4400000000005
I did have a lot of time to do it and I

6454.08 --> 6456.44
did that

6456.6 --> 6461.719
so

6457.739 --> 6461.718999999999
in retrospect yeah I mean

6462.42 --> 6466.679
I should probably see it as like yeah

6464.82 --> 6469.0199999999995
well good at least you did something

6466.679 --> 6472.08
with all that time

6469.02 --> 6474.2390000000005
but yeah it's entertaining and it's I

6472.08 --> 6476.639
mean I know it's pretty good it's

6474.239 --> 6479.159
because I spent so much time it was

6476.639 --> 6481.8
basically like me trying to write a book

6479.159 --> 6483.719
without writing a book I just wanted to

6481.8 --> 6486.54
write the book without

6483.719 --> 6489.06
like having a book then to freaking

6486.54 --> 6491.34
publish I just wanted to do it because

6489.06 --> 6493.8
that's how I work right it's like

6491.34 --> 6496.38
oh Goldsmith cool I want to make

6493.8 --> 6499.02
something really beautiful I don't give

6496.38 --> 6501.42
a [ __ ] if it's gonna make me money or if

6499.02 --> 6504.659000000001
I can sell it or even if other people

6501.42 --> 6507.179
really or if it's going to be popular I

6504.659 --> 6509.099999999999
just want to make this thing

6507.179 --> 6511.02
and that's always been my thing it's

6509.1 --> 6513.84
been my thing with goldsmithing it's

6511.02 --> 6514.619000000001
been my thing with drawing it's been my

6513.84 --> 6517.28
thing

6514.619 --> 6520.08
with writing

6517.28 --> 6522.239
and even in a way it's kind of been my

6520.08 --> 6524.4
thing with live streaming

6522.239 --> 6527.28
I just want to do it

6524.4 --> 6531.0
I don't I don't want to think about

6527.28 --> 6534.719
freaking production or money or all that

6531.0 --> 6535.79
crap I just want to focus on the on the

6534.719 --> 6538.949
art

6535.79 --> 6538.949
[Music]

6539.76 --> 6542.3
anyway

6543.96 --> 6550.199
wizard tower I like wizard towers wizard

6547.8 --> 6551.28
towers catch the sun longer in the

6550.199 --> 6555.839999999999
winter

6551.28 --> 6558.78
wizard towers well might catch lightning

6555.84 --> 6562.860000000001
in the depending on the environment may

6558.78 --> 6565.5599999999995
catch a lot of wind that can be annoying

6562.86 --> 6567.659
so gotta be careful where you build your

6565.56 --> 6570.4400000000005
wizard tower because if you're going to

6567.659 --> 6570.44
build it like

6570.54 --> 6575.46
right on the top of a mountain range

6574.38 --> 6579.3
right

6575.46 --> 6582.4800000000005
then you're gonna gonna get a lot of

6579.3 --> 6584.52
freaking wind and storms so is that what

6582.48 --> 6587.638999999999
you want are you going to use your

6584.52 --> 6590.219
wizard tower like an electric charger

6587.639 --> 6593.28
some reason well it's probably not going

6590.219 --> 6596.0
to be super Pleasant to live there then

6593.28 --> 6599.639
right but wizard towers always have

6596.0 --> 6601.26
functions like why they are there what

6599.639 --> 6603.96
material they are what are they supposed

6601.26 --> 6607.34
to do it wizard tower is never just a

6603.96 --> 6607.34
tower just to be a tower

6607.44 --> 6612.659
it's always a tower for a reason it's

6610.56 --> 6616.46
it does things

6612.659 --> 6620.759999999999
like catches energy or

6616.46 --> 6625.199
impresses in a particular way

6620.76 --> 6626.820000000001
gives you an oversight further over the

6625.199 --> 6629.099999999999
horizon than those lower to the ground

6626.82 --> 6631.44
right all these things

6629.1 --> 6631.89
that's what real wizard tower really is

6631.44 --> 6633.299999999999
all about

6631.89 --> 6635.9400000000005
[Music]

6633.3 --> 6637.9800000000005
wizard tower is could be considered

6635.94 --> 6642.0599999999995
basically like a

6637.98 --> 6644.879999999999
a out of control

6642.06 --> 6647.639
scouting post

6644.88 --> 6650.04
right a scouting Tower

6647.639 --> 6652.34
well a wizard tower is also a scouting

6650.04 --> 6652.34
Tower

6653.46 --> 6658.56
I mean that's pretty default function

6656.4 --> 6661.199
for any weather Tower is that it has

6658.56 --> 6664.26
some kind of platform at top where you

6661.199 --> 6666.419999999999
can literally just look out

6664.26 --> 6669.360000000001
and well in this Dungeons and Dragons

6666.42 --> 6671.76
game where you could potentially cast a

6669.36 --> 6673.139
fly spell and then fly away or arrive

6671.76 --> 6676.1
there

6673.139 --> 6676.1
that sort of thing

6678.0 --> 6683.06
right or where you could have your Giant

6680.219 --> 6683.06
Eagle land

6684.6 --> 6687.659000000001
thank you

6685.5 --> 6690.239
that sort of thing anyway

6687.659 --> 6693.07
yeah it was was fun

6690.239 --> 6696.28
watching through that

6693.07 --> 6696.28
[Music]

6698.699 --> 6704.82
High vibrational energy yeah thank you

6701.52 --> 6707.1
PGC net I always designed these things

6704.82 --> 6709.5599999999995
from the perspective that the people

6707.1 --> 6712.1990000000005
really want it and that they're gonna do

6709.56 --> 6714.659000000001
something with it so every time I design

6712.199 --> 6719.04
something it's always just like

6714.659 --> 6722.04
it does it does get infused with energy

6719.04 --> 6724.38
and the funny thing is that it as you're

6722.04 --> 6728.1
role playing the game

6724.38 --> 6729.659000000001
and using such drawings like on the on

6728.1 --> 6731.34
the background

6729.659 --> 6735.42
like

6731.34 --> 6737.04
uh on the board I draw on the board and

6735.42 --> 6740.58
then you put your pawns on there and

6737.04 --> 6742.56
then you play right I draw those maps on

6740.58 --> 6744.739
the boards that I have literally I still

6742.56 --> 6744.7390000000005
have

6749.6 --> 6752.719
a half

6755.699 --> 6759.44
oh right excellent example

6766.98 --> 6774.119
wait

6769.01 --> 6776.9400000000005
[Music]

6774.119 --> 6781.4

6776.94 --> 6781.4

6781.619 --> 6784.58
foreign

6914.78 --> 6919.86

was a huge pain in the ass

6952.38 --> 6957.42
and I was explaining exactly how I did

6954.9 --> 6960.119
it yeah so this stuff

6957.42 --> 6962.1
is transparent plastic

6960.119 --> 6965.28
see

6962.1 --> 6970.320000000001
so this is all transparent all of this

6965.28 --> 6972.719
and this is sticky plastic paper

6970.32 --> 6975.84
it's like what you put on a book

6972.719 --> 6977.639
except not transparent but what

6975.84 --> 6982.679
I did then

6977.639 --> 6985.26
is on the sticky side so take off the

6982.679 --> 6990.6
the sticky protector

6985.26 --> 6995.58
and on the Sticky Side draw this grid on

6990.6 --> 6999.42
the sticky side then put it exactly very

6995.58 --> 7002.119
carefully onto this piece of plastic so

6999.42 --> 7004.159
that it would perfectly match like it

7002.119 --> 7006.5
had to be exact

7004.159 --> 7010.339999999999
16 times

7006.5 --> 7013.4
16 times I did it like I spent

7010.34 --> 7016.219
probably combined like a hundred hours

7013.4 --> 7019.4
on on doing all that

7016.219 --> 7022.28
because it was very tricky you had to be

7019.4 --> 7024.739
very careful it took a lot of time and

7022.28 --> 7027.86
it was like annoying

7024.739 --> 7030.138999999999
but I'm so happy that I got him I wish

7027.86 --> 7033.5
these things could be standardized

7030.139 --> 7035.3
because this is like a Gamers tool I

7033.5 --> 7039.679
mean if you could just buy these things

7035.3 --> 7042.1990000000005
for like 10 euros a piece it would be

7039.679 --> 7043.9400000000005
freaking worth it man it would be worth

7042.199 --> 7046.04
it as [ __ ]

7043.94 --> 7048.08
but I've never seen anything like these

7046.04 --> 7050.179
I had to make these myself from scratch

7048.08 --> 7052.88
and it was a giant pain in the ass but

7050.179 --> 7055.9400000000005
oh my god did it pay off

7052.88 --> 7058.58
I just never want to do it again

7055.94 --> 7061.339999999999
it's not it was that annoying I did it

7058.58 --> 7063.099
I'm so happy I have it I never want to

7061.34 --> 7066.58
do that again

7063.099 --> 7066.58
it sucked

7070.88 --> 7073.599
right

7077.659 --> 7083.119
I even got this special suitcase for

7080.119 --> 7087.0199999999995
them just just for these boards

7083.119 --> 7089.83
so then I always be able to carry them

7087.02 --> 7098.649
with me safely

7089.83 --> 7098.649
[Music]

7101.9 --> 7107.259999999999
also it made me look like a really

7104.0 --> 7107.26
professional game master

7107.659 --> 7112.638999999999
because

7108.639 --> 7114.9800000000005
literally nobody has that nobody

7112.639 --> 7118.219
I mean they might have their expensive

7114.98 --> 7120.739
set pieces that they spend thousands of

7118.219 --> 7124.58
dollars on or whatever with their real

7120.739 --> 7127.28
plastic free fabricated printed castles

7124.58 --> 7128.239
and [ __ ] which is really cool I have to

7127.28 --> 7131.36
admit

7128.239 --> 7133.638999999999
yeah but nobody has that because

7131.36 --> 7135.5599999999995
nobody's gonna take all their Castle

7133.639 --> 7138.08
[ __ ] with them

7135.56 --> 7140.06
you gotta leave such stuff in a

7138.08 --> 7141.98
playground because it's too much it's

7140.06 --> 7144.02
literally like

7141.98 --> 7146.36
yeah you're not gonna take a giant

7144.02 --> 7147.26
bucket of Legos with you everywhere you

7146.36 --> 7149.36
know

7147.26 --> 7150.860000000001
but these things

7149.36 --> 7154.88
perfect

7150.86 --> 7156.679
16 plates a giant possibility of what

7154.88 --> 7159.92
you can do with these plates you have to

7156.679 --> 7163.6990000000005
plan it carefully I basically arranged

7159.92 --> 7167.599
all my map making to be specifically the

7163.699 --> 7172.699
same size grids as as these Maps so it's

7167.599 --> 7176.0
16 by 16 grit with all my map drawings

7172.699 --> 7178.699
and then you plan it out you say

7176.0 --> 7180.8
what locations are going to be necessary

7178.699 --> 7184.879999999999
the most

7180.8 --> 7187.46
and then how what like which one could I

7184.88 --> 7188.96
exchanged you have blank place where

7187.46 --> 7190.94
there's just nothing really there it's

7188.96 --> 7192.86
unremarkable

7190.94 --> 7194.9
well you can use them for other parts

7192.86 --> 7197.179
like that and there are like very

7194.9 --> 7199.339999999999
distinct locations well those are going

7197.179 --> 7202.659
to be specifically pre-drawn

7199.34 --> 7206.119000000001
so you can like see like oh the reveal

7202.659 --> 7207.5
here it is you have arrived on that

7206.119 --> 7210.44
specific Square

7207.5 --> 7213.56
right that's how I basically game

7210.44 --> 7217.96
mastered and it was really [ __ ] good

7213.56 --> 7217.96
at it and it could still do it

7220.52 --> 7228.139
yeah can you imagine my Gamers basically

7223.58 --> 7230.48
abandoned all that because of Corona

7228.139 --> 7231.7390000000005
yeah

7230.48 --> 7233.598999999999
yeah and I don't think they're coming

7231.739 --> 7235.638999999999
back together again I don't even know if

7233.599 --> 7237.88
they're still all alive I kind of hope

7235.639 --> 7237.88
so

7237.98 --> 7245.598999999999
but maybe it's also because I was kind

7240.08 --> 7245.599
of a conspiracy theorist and not pro-gay

7245.96 --> 7250.52
even then

7247.639 --> 7252.9800000000005
I mean I played with these Gamers even

7250.52 --> 7254.780000000001
during

7252.98 --> 7257.36
yeah during the

7254.78 --> 7259.099
during the YouTuber yeah I was on

7257.36 --> 7261.679
YouTube being a flat earther already

7259.099 --> 7263.860000000001
when I was also still playing with these

7261.679 --> 7263.86
guys

7278.659 --> 7285.5
right anyway hope you enjoyed all that

7282.08 --> 7289.179
little Gamer's bonus I don't know what

7285.5 --> 7289.179
to actually call Today's Show

7289.52 --> 7293.02
