so

89.36 --> 93.92
sorry for starting an hour late

95.64 --> 102.0
kind of had a late night last night

98.939 --> 104.69999999999999
the weather right now is

102.0 --> 106.74
I don't know

104.7 --> 109.799
seems to be just a tiny bit of a

106.74 --> 111.24
clearing it's been raining and gray and

109.799 --> 113.10000000000001
cloudy

111.24 --> 116.64
all day and night

113.1 --> 119.96
and yesterday there was like really

116.64 --> 119.96
crazy storm weather

120.06 --> 127.02
like really hard

123.24 --> 128.819
I'm surprised that that all trees are

127.02 --> 132.0
actually still standing upright because

128.819 --> 134.33999999999997
it it blowed so incredibly hard

132.0 --> 137.7
I thought that like

134.34 --> 141.3
branches were gonna snap

137.7 --> 142.73899999999998
it it almost felt like I was in a

141.3 --> 144.48000000000002
tornado

142.739 --> 147.26
almost

144.48 --> 147.26
last night

147.54 --> 152.599
never ever seen it storm that hard here

150.36 --> 152.59900000000002
before

152.7 --> 159.26
all right but yeah apparently uh

155.76 --> 159.26
trees are still standing

159.48 --> 163.5
so

160.8 --> 166.16000000000003
and it's now kind of calm

163.5 --> 166.16
peaceful

167.879 --> 172.62
um

169.5 --> 174.48
hello aisles G first in chat M good to

172.62 --> 178.519
see you

174.48 --> 178.51899999999998
I'm only doing an hour show today

181.019 --> 184.8
and

183.0 --> 189.08
yeah

184.8 --> 189.08
I think probably tomorrow as well

190.14 --> 194.48
it's just this week I'm feeling weird

207.239 --> 212.59900000000002
let's see

209.28 --> 212.599
what's going down yesterday

227.04 --> 231.2
I don't remember what I was watching

228.9 --> 231.20000000000002
yesterday

233.76 --> 239.48
the Mitchell from Australia was live I

236.64 --> 239.48
think twice even

242.34 --> 246.68
but I only caught like half a show

255.42 --> 259.799
anyway yeah

257.34 --> 263.11999999999995
it's not

259.799 --> 263.12
I don't know what I've been doing

263.88 --> 267.38
all right uh

273.9 --> 280.85999999999996
was there some kind of a

276.78 --> 283.82
QE live situation again

280.86 --> 283.82
I'm not sure

286.32 --> 290.0
I remember staying after

290.1 --> 298.639
no wait aha now I remember yeah yeah

294.24 --> 303.0
now I actually kind of I joined Discord

298.639 --> 304.919
after Nathan Oakley the after show was

303.0 --> 307.919
over and then kind of like talked with

304.919 --> 310.139
the people in Discord for two hours

307.919 --> 312.79999999999995
and then Ballers came in and started

310.139 --> 312.8
ruining it

313.139 --> 315.86
I remember

318.24 --> 322.28000000000003
I was great on QE live okay thanks

322.68 --> 328.1
classical homeopath

324.6 --> 328.1
hello Bobby steals

332.34 --> 337.5
ha USG

333.96 --> 340.75899999999996
yeah you've been uh very busy I did get

337.5 --> 340.759
your email with the songs

342.12 --> 345.44
that's interesting

396.72 --> 399.319
right

403.94 --> 409.979
ah yeah yeah

407.22 --> 413.09900000000005
guys I hope I'm gonna be

409.979 --> 415.86
a little bit more engaged starting next

413.099 --> 420.02
week or this weekend hopefully

415.86 --> 420.02000000000004
I don't know I'm very distracted

420.479 --> 426.479
I had a lot of feelings

423.12 --> 429.74
that are like getting in my way

426.479 --> 429.74
of clear thinking

430.979 --> 434.75899999999996
and I pretty much have it like

432.78 --> 437.21999999999997
continually

434.759 --> 441.38
but it's not like oh nightmare level

437.22 --> 441.38000000000005
it's just that it's constantly in my way

443.039 --> 445.88
it's happened before

450.66 --> 457.68
so yeah I have a lot of ideas always in

455.16 --> 459.47900000000004
all directions usually it's just now

457.68 --> 462.18
that

459.479 --> 464.58
I'm not I'm not grabbing hold of them

462.18 --> 468.3
I'm not taking him and basically going

464.58 --> 470.46
in on them and elaborating because

468.3 --> 472.94
like I don't feel like I could do it

470.46 --> 472.94
right now

476.16 --> 480.56
in in a sense you could even yeah almost

478.919 --> 483.599
say that I'm like temporarily

480.56 --> 486.84
demoralized but

483.599 --> 488.28
it's because of a physical situation and

486.84 --> 490.73999999999995
not

488.28 --> 493.79999999999995
because of things happening out there

490.74 --> 496.879
because they're always just kind of like

493.8 --> 496.879
what they are

497.16 --> 502.139
if I consulted with my healer recently

499.62 --> 504.919
well I've tried but apparently he is

502.139 --> 504.919
sick right now

506.759 --> 513.36
so I think he probably caught a snippet

510.419 --> 517.76
of the ancestral wins as well

513.36 --> 520.5600000000001
and he's always taking on a lot of

517.76 --> 522.959
actions I don't know I don't know what

520.56 --> 525.54
the rest of his life is like

522.959 --> 528.8
but I'm pretty sure it's it's good it's

525.54 --> 528.8
very logos driven

535.32 --> 539.839
what's the physical situation what

547.92 --> 550.5799999999999
all right

555.24 --> 562.08
well my physical situation is kind of

558.66 --> 564.3
like roughly described I'm just a little

562.08 --> 567.12
nauseated

564.3 --> 569.5799999999999
and it just doesn't seem to want to go

567.12 --> 572.1
away right now

569.58 --> 574.5
but it's not like so bad that I

572.1 --> 577.5
constantly feel unwell and like help I

574.5 --> 581.04
want this to be over it's just

577.5 --> 584.339
it's kind of like a neck

581.04 --> 586.92
but when I'm really trying to pump in

584.339 --> 588.839
more energy and focus in my actions then

586.92 --> 590.5799999999999
it gets bad

588.839 --> 594.1800000000001
like

590.58 --> 596.76
I said not yesterday but the day before

594.18 --> 599.0999999999999
that's kind of how I needed to end the

596.76 --> 601.56
show because

599.1 --> 604.62
it was already there and at the start I

601.56 --> 607.5
thought like yeah yeah I can handle this

604.62 --> 609.899
but then people basically unwittingly

607.5 --> 612.72
unwittingly

609.899 --> 615.06
because I invite them to to be very open

612.72 --> 618.0600000000001
and direct and honest and lay down all

615.06 --> 621.2399999999999
their issues here

618.06 --> 623.2199999999999
like to present them honestly and then

621.24 --> 625.62
when I get confronted with it I just

623.22 --> 628.74
noticed that like whoa I can't take this

625.62 --> 630.6
now and then I get sick it's really

628.74 --> 633.36
bizarre it's like a

630.6 --> 636.3000000000001
I just get sick

633.36 --> 640.14
and it's not even because something so

636.3 --> 643.019
dark was said or as anything right

640.14 --> 645.18
it's just that I the stress that comes

643.019 --> 648.68
with it now suddenly I'm just not really

645.18 --> 648.68
able to handle it as well

652.2 --> 655.88
it's actually quite frustrating

658.26 --> 662.12
but I know it'll go away again

662.459 --> 669.1199999999999
you have a cold or something

665.06 --> 671.279
no not like that I have been very sniffy

669.12 --> 674.279
though

671.279 --> 676.98
but it's not like oh I got

674.279 --> 680.899
my lungs have gotten it or my throat or

676.98 --> 680.899
sinus or nothing like that

697.079 --> 701.64
I mean like having the flu is really

700.26 --> 703.98
easy

701.64 --> 705.6
to sit through for me

703.98 --> 708.899
because

705.6 --> 711.72
it kind of disrupts things in order that

708.899 --> 714.6
you simply don't even have the option to

711.72 --> 716.76
engage you just have to like uh

714.6 --> 719.94
sit through it

716.76 --> 722.399
and not panic and just take it easy and

719.94 --> 726.48
then you're not gonna get distracted

722.399 --> 729.6
because the situation is distracting

726.48 --> 733.139
and you end up like really kind of going

729.6 --> 734.76
Zen not preoccupying your mind

733.139 --> 736.44
because you just

734.76 --> 738.24
to preoccupied with the physical

736.44 --> 740.519
situation

738.24 --> 743.22
almost like that was

740.519 --> 744.48
part of the design of it the force it to

743.22 --> 745.86
do that

744.48 --> 748.519
right but that's not what I'm

745.86 --> 748.519
experiencing

749.579 --> 754.62
I don't have like a coal or the flu but

752.459 --> 756.899
I am like

754.62 --> 759.0
a little wobbly

756.899 --> 761.72
like my intestines seem like extra

759.0 --> 761.72
sensitive

764.279 --> 768.3
why is Sean Hawkins still blocked on my

766.8 --> 772.079
channel

768.3 --> 774.12
why do you think oh oh get the [ __ ] out

772.079 --> 775.68
of here

774.12 --> 778.079
scum

775.68 --> 781.16
yeah I'm not gonna unblock him you

778.079 --> 784.5
understand he is a troll I don't care

781.16 --> 788.04
how nice he presented himself at one

784.5 --> 791.22
point in chat and how endlessly he's

788.04 --> 796.38
going to blabber on about how ungrateful

791.22 --> 798.1800000000001
I am just like Randy scumbag did when he

796.38 --> 801.24
gave me that camera and he kept on doing

798.18 --> 803.2199999999999
that for half a year right originally oh

801.24 --> 805.44
I'm so generous I'm just gonna give oh

803.22 --> 810.899
I'm so generous and then whine and

805.44 --> 814.139
complain and nag and Central sock trolls

810.899 --> 816.54
for half a [ __ ] year yeah I know what

814.139 --> 818.339
that's like

816.54 --> 821.399
I know that I knew that was gonna happen

818.339 --> 824.36
but I wasn't going to stop him he was

821.399 --> 824.36
going to do it anyway

826.68 --> 831.3
at least this time I got something out

829.019 --> 835.079
of it some donation

831.3 --> 836.88
right that's mine now unconditionally

835.079 --> 838.3199999999999
you know he even offered to send it back

836.88 --> 841.399
to him

838.32 --> 841.399
he didn't want that

842.94 --> 849.24
right so whether it is him

845.279 --> 851.699
or whether it is other people

849.24 --> 855.1800000000001
gamma trolls that are going to use that

851.699 --> 856.68
situation to nag my ass off about it I'm

855.18 --> 859.3199999999999
not gonna do it

856.68 --> 861.3599999999999
I don't want him here

859.32 --> 864.1800000000001
he's a nuisance

861.36 --> 867.42
he's uncontrollable he cannot control

864.18 --> 870.2399999999999
himself he is going to ruin my chat he's

867.42 --> 874.8199999999999
going to ruin what I do here not gonna

870.24 --> 874.82
allow him to do that don't care

882.06 --> 886.0189999999999
about why did he give it to me well

883.98 --> 887.5790000000001
because I kind of want it I wanted a

886.019 --> 889.74
p900

887.579 --> 891.18
it was really the thing

889.74 --> 893.4590000000001
back then

891.18 --> 895.4399999999999
and I wasn't interested I did get a

893.459 --> 899.2199999999999
couple of good shots with it

895.44 --> 903.3000000000001
but I just never became that guy that

899.22 --> 907.1990000000001
just consciously goes outside and

903.3 --> 909.12
tries to get interesting Horizon footage

907.199 --> 911.7199999999999
just

909.12 --> 911.72

1265.7 --> 1269.44
take unconditional gifts

like

1279.62 --> 1286.52
having issues dealing with it like

1286.52 --> 1290.96
technical

1288.559 --> 1293.8999999999999
with electronic equipment like that

1290.96 --> 1296.059
because I'm just having trouble even

1293.9 --> 1299.299
figuring out like how it works still

1296.059 --> 1303.8799999999999
even though I've used it plenty of times

1299.299 --> 1303.8799999999999
just like I'm not getting the feel of it

1305.059 --> 1310.22

time I've ever read that name in my chat

1458.0 --> 1461.6
I'm sorry to hear about your cat

1460.22 --> 1464.059
whatever

1461.6 --> 1466.84

1464.059 --> 1466.84
seem like a troll

1467.84 --> 1475.24
identify yourself you are me

1471.26 --> 1475.24
yeah that's cute

1477.679 --> 1482.0590000000002

1500.36 --> 1502.779
my chat

1509.179 --> 1514.4
long ago okay well it was if it was like

1512.299 --> 1518.48
longer than two years ago and you just

1514.4 --> 1520.46
said hi once or came in my chat once

1518.48 --> 1521.779
yeah

1520.46 --> 1524.659
might be

1521.779 --> 1527.059
but I don't know you just because you

1524.659 --> 1528.5
popped up and had a conversation with me

1527.059 --> 1531.32
one day

1528.5 --> 1534.26
like two years ago all right that

1531.32 --> 1536.059
doesn't automatically Make Me Remember

1534.26 --> 1538.64
every detail

1536.059 --> 1541.1
every person that was ever there

1538.64 --> 1543.0800000000002
like that only really happens when you

1541.1 --> 1546.34
stick around for a while and we have

1543.08 --> 1546.34
more close conversations

1547.52 --> 1552.02
two years ago I told you

1550.279 --> 1555.279
my dog okay

1552.02 --> 1555.279
I don't really remember

1562.159 --> 1565.3400000000001
anyway

1563.419 --> 1567.76
all right if that's all true no hard

1565.34 --> 1567.76
feelings

1587.12 --> 1591.26
no I'll download some instructions yeah

1589.46 --> 1594.7
that's cute

1591.26 --> 1594.7
I actually have them

1598.1 --> 1601.6
it doesn't really help me

1616.88 --> 1621.0200000000002
right but before I can get really

1618.98 --> 1623.179
serious again with the camera I have to

1621.02 --> 1627.1
like get the battery issue fixed because

1623.179 --> 1627.1000000000001
the battery is in there kind of suck

1635.24 --> 1639.64
it's not on my priority list right now

1644.539 --> 1648.8799999999999

oh man by the way

1728.179 --> 1733.159
I had an odd I haven't I'm having an odd

1731.659 --> 1735.44
little experience

1733.159 --> 1738.0200000000002
is weird this time

1735.44 --> 1739.8200000000002
with Owen Benjamin there's nothing wrong

1738.02 --> 1743.96
with what he's done

1739.82 --> 1746.62
nothing nothing he's done is wrong yeah

1743.96 --> 1746.6200000000001
deal with it

1746.659 --> 1752.2990000000002
but like there's this thing with the

1749.179 --> 1755.539
Dave Chappelle now kind of like echoing

1752.299 --> 1757.82
his jokes and he's had clips about that

1755.539 --> 1760.1
like for over a year where it just shows

1757.82 --> 1762.3799999999999
it like see this is when I made a joke

1760.1 --> 1764.9189999999999
all those years ago and he got all

1762.38 --> 1766.88
ostracized and kicked out and

1764.919 --> 1771.74
blocked

1766.88 --> 1774.38
money with yeah blocked and all terrible

1771.74 --> 1777.26
and now Dave Chappelle is doing those

1774.38 --> 1779.5390000000002
[ __ ] jokes and getting a lot of

1777.26 --> 1781.399
credit for it and it's like yeah I'm

1779.539 --> 1785.0
hurrying that from my own Benjamin but

1781.399 --> 1788.9599999999998
I'm literally seeing it

1785.0 --> 1791.299
in in freaking news

1788.96 --> 1793.46
like oh the Dave Chappelle is getting a

1791.299 --> 1795.26
lot of criticism for his jokes look

1793.46 --> 1797.1200000000001
there's even almost like a protest

1795.26 --> 1798.86
mounting and it's like dude what the

1797.12 --> 1802.1589999999999
[ __ ] man

1798.86 --> 1805.12
because I know that's Owen Benjamin's

1802.159 --> 1805.1200000000001
joke so this is

1807.2 --> 1813.8600000000001
yeah that like

1810.26 --> 1816.98
this is real stolen works

1813.86 --> 1820.2199999999998
and like even the response to it

1816.98 --> 1822.14
it's like the machine has stolen

1820.22 --> 1824.779
Owen's jokes

1822.14 --> 1827.779
and then assimilated it into that

1824.779 --> 1829.52
Chappelle dude and working with that

1827.779 --> 1832.039
from him

1829.52 --> 1835.8799999999999
from his vantage point with the rest of

1832.039 --> 1838.64
the world it's really sickening like

1835.88 --> 1841.1200000000001
I'm shocked and and they're not even my

1838.64 --> 1841.1200000000001
jokes

1842.24 --> 1846.559
and I'm like but you bump into that it's

1844.76 --> 1848.72
news art that's like oh look at the

1846.559 --> 1851.12
latest thing oh Dave Chappelle and Mr

1848.72 --> 1852.8600000000001
trance jokes are like dude what the [ __ ]

1851.12 --> 1854.2399999999998
man

1852.86 --> 1857.1789999999999
really

1854.24 --> 1859.7
like that's not his jokes

1857.179 --> 1862.159
how is he now all special for doing that

1859.7 --> 1866.0800000000002
he literally stole it

1862.159 --> 1866.0800000000002
like almost word for word

1869.14 --> 1875.779
a Adam remember how I was outraged in

1873.62 --> 1877.9399999999998
the Amsterdam conference when people

1875.779 --> 1879.98
brought up Dave Chappelle and how funny

1877.94 --> 1883.159
he was

1879.98 --> 1885.919
and that I said no he sucks he literally

1883.159 --> 1890.14
steals Owen Benjamin's jokes and that

1885.919 --> 1890.14
was in 2019 right

1891.98 --> 1897.58
and now I'm seeing all this [ __ ] roll

1894.14 --> 1897.5800000000002
out it's really bizarre

1904.519 --> 1911.6200000000001
that's a pseudo Dave Chappelle what kind

1907.94 --> 1911.6200000000001
of a statement what does that mean

1912.14 --> 1915.8200000000002
you're just a troll aren't you

1922.7 --> 1927.22
I wonder how many jokes you stole from

1924.799 --> 1927.22
others

1930.98 --> 1935.96
virtue mining

1933.32 --> 1938.1789999999999
wow

1935.96 --> 1940.1000000000001
that's an interesting word

1938.179 --> 1942.5
for that

1940.1 --> 1945.399
pseudo means fake

1942.5 --> 1945.399
uh yeah

1946.76 --> 1954.32
but it's still the Jeff Chappelle right

1951.62 --> 1957.0189999999998
it's all staged well yeah comedy is kind

1954.32 --> 1961.0
of like a stage act isn't it so it's

1957.019 --> 1961.0
kind of a weird thing to say

1966.039 --> 1971.72
bisexuals being prejudiced

1968.96 --> 1973.7
for only being attracted to two Sexes

1971.72 --> 1975.58
that's hilarious but I'm afraid that

1973.7 --> 1980.179
bisexuals

1975.58 --> 1982.8799999999999
like Dubai is kind of a false binary

1980.179 --> 1986.299
it's just

1982.88 --> 1989.7990000000002
uh usually I I don't know you you see I

1986.299 --> 1993.32
don't really care about

1989.799 --> 1998.179
different degrees of sexual perversion

1993.32 --> 2001.86
of people like I'm not interested

1998.179 --> 2001.8600000000001
I think it's only just gay

2008.38 --> 2017.1000000000001
right there's only one type of sex that

2012.46 --> 2017.1000000000001
I'm interested and that's man on woman

2035.799 --> 2042.279
he was replaced

2038.98 --> 2046.96
oh is this kind of like the bottom line

2042.279 --> 2048.7
Joe Rogan conspiratory talk

2046.96 --> 2052.2400000000002
like what

2048.7 --> 2053.7999999999997
the bottom feeder conspiracy dumbasses

2052.24 --> 2056.5
say

2053.8 --> 2060.94
because they just got got to make a

2056.5 --> 2064.72
habit of just making up really cheap ass

2060.94 --> 2066.76
oh this happened like oh you think you

2064.72 --> 2070.24
sound smart because you say that no you

2066.76 --> 2073.0600000000004
sound really [ __ ] dumb like you are

2070.24 --> 2074.2799999999997
there to demonstrate to those who don't

2073.06 --> 2078.82
do that

2074.28 --> 2081.7000000000003
that you are actually negative

2078.82 --> 2085.119
to the conspiracy sector you are one of

2081.7 --> 2087.04
those people that make everybody deter

2085.119 --> 2089.9190000000003
from getting into that because they

2087.04 --> 2093.46
don't want to sound as dumb as you one

2089.919 --> 2096.399
day you understand that

2093.46 --> 2098.68
if you're [ __ ] [ __ ] then shut the

2096.399 --> 2101.2
[ __ ] up and don't try to be smart

2098.68 --> 2103.359
because you heard something somewhere on

2101.2 --> 2106.4199999999996
the show one time

2103.359 --> 2108.7
we heard somebody blabber some rumor

2106.42 --> 2112.619
just makes you look stupid

2108.7 --> 2112.6189999999997
rubs off bad

2132.16 --> 2137.44
okay lamal forever I don't know if I

2134.38 --> 2139.3
agree with that that's a I don't

2137.44 --> 2141.64
not entirely sure if I even understand

2139.3 --> 2144.78
what that means but

2141.64 --> 2144.7799999999997
probably don't agree

2146.98 --> 2151.619
what like what polymorphic traits What

2156.28 --> 2166.8
there are more than two genders that no

2160.3 --> 2166.8
no just no no to all of it it's all no

2170.32 --> 2176.26
right I don't care

2172.96 --> 2180.94
for the inflection

2176.26 --> 2182.98
on an erroneous answer it's all just no

2180.94 --> 2185.619
okay

2182.98 --> 2188.2
it's all wrong I don't care like with

2185.619 --> 2189.82
the detail of which type of wrong you're

2188.2 --> 2192.8999999999996
gonna choose

2189.82 --> 2192.9
it's all wrong

2198.64 --> 2202.5989999999997
you don't care what everyone else thinks

2200.68 --> 2204.94
okay so you just came up with that

2202.599 --> 2206.5
naughty conclusion yourself then

2204.94 --> 2209.14
what's the lead

2206.5 --> 2211.98
you have different ears does he have a

2209.14 --> 2211.98
different Dental record

2212.079 --> 2216.2400000000002
are his eyes of a different size

2218.079 --> 2223.54
like what actually like oh you say

2220.599 --> 2226.78
replacement somebody else oh what what

2223.54 --> 2230.619
the [ __ ] is even the leading evidence to

2226.78 --> 2233.02
suggest this other than oh he seemed to

2230.619 --> 2235.6600000000003
act differently now yeah no [ __ ] dude

2233.02 --> 2237.88
that happens to people you know when you

2235.66 --> 2239.74
you when you assimilate another type of

2237.88 --> 2243.4
spirit when you make dramatic decisions

2239.74 --> 2246.2799999999997
that have a significant impact

2243.4 --> 2248.2000000000003
on your representation of yourself and

2246.28 --> 2252.099
your spiritual energy yeah you're going

2248.2 --> 2255.52
to seem different that's normal

2252.099 --> 2256.48
to then say is somebody else is kind of

2255.52 --> 2260.04
lame

2256.48 --> 2260.04
and very short-sighted

2263.5 --> 2269.74
yeah Kuma virus what's funny about that

2266.68 --> 2271.8999999999996
if it's actually another person

2269.74 --> 2273.339
right like what happened with Stephen

2271.9 --> 2277.599
Hawkins

2273.339 --> 2280.18
yeah he's not the same guy he died

2277.599 --> 2282.76
very blatantly obviously so

2280.18 --> 2285.04
long time ago because nobody lived

2282.76 --> 2286.2400000000002
Beyond a certain age nobody no matter

2285.04 --> 2288.7
what they do

2286.24 --> 2291.16
no matter the high tech there's no

2288.7 --> 2292.96
stopping it no matter the high tech not

2291.16 --> 2295.24
even the stuff that's not even supposed

2292.96 --> 2299.7400000000002
to be officially recognized in a hundred

2295.24 --> 2301.9599999999996
years that nothing can stop that you see

2299.74 --> 2304.24
so he died

2301.96 --> 2306.839
and the other guy that went to replace

2304.24 --> 2310.66
him had a different Dental record

2306.839 --> 2312.94
blatantly so right to suggest oh

2310.66 --> 2316.18
it's not the same guy it's like yeah

2312.94 --> 2318.64
there is actual evidence for that right

2316.18 --> 2320.859
so if you just go to oh they should feel

2318.64 --> 2324.66
somebody else oh really what's the

2320.859 --> 2324.66
evidence what's your evidence

2327.04 --> 2333.7599999999998
oh you just had a really Wheely about it

2331.18 --> 2337.0
and you don't know what else to do with

2333.76 --> 2340.42
it and you just draw a very sloppily

2337.0 --> 2343.8
sloppy conspiracy conclusion yeah that

2340.42 --> 2343.8
just makes you look very stupid

2348.4 --> 2353.38
how does one become less dark uh

2354.46 --> 2359.859
I don't know

2357.18 --> 2362.0789999999997
I know there's ways to do it like how

2359.859 --> 2364.7799999999997
did Michael Jackson become less dark

2362.079 --> 2367.2400000000002
right there's all kinds of therapies and

2364.78 --> 2370.2400000000002
[ __ ] like but it's a weird idea like

2367.24 --> 2372.9599999999996
maybe would he do that

2370.24 --> 2372.9599999999996
I don't know

2373.78 --> 2379.32
but yeah you can change your skin color

2376.24 --> 2379.3199999999997
don't recommend it

2380.2 --> 2384.0989999999997
right

2381.76 --> 2386.8
you can make

2384.099 --> 2388.839
black people really really chocolate

2386.8 --> 2391.0600000000004
black people

2388.839 --> 2394.839
you can make them a little lighter don't

2391.06 --> 2398.14
recommend it you can also make very

2394.839 --> 2399.5789999999997
Whitey white people turn them into

2398.14 --> 2402.46
orange man

2399.579 --> 2404.38
or get them all browned up you know what

2402.46 --> 2408.099
that's like

2404.38 --> 2409.599
right don't really recommend it either I

2408.099 --> 2412.619
think that kind of looks stupid but

2409.599 --> 2412.619
that's just me this

2413.56 --> 2418.06
so

2416.02 --> 2420.48
that's not evidence he's a different

2418.06 --> 2420.48
person

2423.7 --> 2429.9399999999996
did I check what I have to check his

2426.88 --> 2432.2200000000003
teeth to confirm your claim

2429.94 --> 2433.78
that it's not the same person Omega

2432.22 --> 2436.9199999999996
Genesis

2433.78 --> 2436.92
that sounds familiar

2441.4 --> 2448.78
his own fam oh really

2445.839 --> 2451.619
I have no idea about that that's a

2448.78 --> 2451.619
different story then

2475.72 --> 2481.66
right well that's a lead at least you

2479.92 --> 2484.599
could have said that before

2481.66 --> 2486.3999999999996
you know like hey his family members

2484.599 --> 2488.8
have officially stated

2486.4 --> 2490.48
that they don't feel it's him right

2488.8 --> 2492.6400000000003
that's a lead

2490.48 --> 2495.16
why didn't you just say that immediately

2492.64 --> 2498.339
that's an actual lead do you have any

2495.16 --> 2500.6189999999997
sense for finding evidence or are you

2498.339 --> 2502.119
just wandering around blabbering

2500.619 --> 2504.6600000000003
aimlessly

2502.119 --> 2504.6600000000003
hello

2523.24 --> 2528.06
hmm okay lemel forever interesting

2528.7 --> 2534.2999999999997
this is like a condition you continually

2531.28 --> 2534.3
grow more pale

2535.3 --> 2538.26
that's odd

2578.8 --> 2585.04
is to lessen the effect really what's

2582.94 --> 2586.66
your medical evidence it actually does

2585.04 --> 2590.319
that

2586.66 --> 2590.319
CPS misquote

2595.619 --> 2602.46
is to lessen the effects from like what

2599.319 --> 2602.46
does that even mean

2602.68 --> 2607.6189999999997
that's extremely in specific

2622.66 --> 2624.839
foreign

2651.96 --> 2656.619
natural immunity

2654.88 --> 2658.2400000000002
get over it

2656.619 --> 2660.88
right

2658.24 --> 2664.18
get over it you're gonna be sick when

2660.88 --> 2666.7000000000003
you live you will get sick it's normal

2664.18 --> 2669.46
it's a metabolic process it's part of

2666.7 --> 2672.7
being alive going through that

2669.46 --> 2674.56
God designed it like that

2672.7 --> 2676.8999999999996
you're gonna have to deal with it's

2674.56 --> 2678.88
never gonna go away there will never be

2676.9 --> 2680.7400000000002
a Humanity without sickness do you

2678.88 --> 2684.4
understand never

2680.74 --> 2688.2599999999998
because the sickness is part of being a

2684.4 --> 2688.26
human it's necessary

2688.42 --> 2694.359
right we don't appreciate it because we

2691.839 --> 2697.359
don't like being sick

2694.359 --> 2700.72
but if you then just let that notion

2697.359 --> 2703.5989999999997
take over your decision making and

2700.72 --> 2707.7599999999998
Overlook that you actually need the

2703.599 --> 2707.76
process of being sick

2707.859 --> 2711.119
in a lot of cases

2711.4 --> 2716.8
yeah then you might start to fantasize

2714.28 --> 2720.1600000000003
about some future where nobody gets sick

2716.8 --> 2723.88
it's [ __ ] like even if you were at

2720.16 --> 2727.839
the the perfect nutritional stuff and

2723.88 --> 2731.2000000000003
and like everything is maximized

2727.839 --> 2733.599
as divinely possible

2731.2 --> 2736.24
you're still gonna get sick

2733.599 --> 2738.54
right because getting sick is not just

2736.24 --> 2738.54
about

2738.76 --> 2743.4
not having enough for your body not to

2741.16 --> 2746.7999999999997
get sick no getting sick is something

2743.4 --> 2749.079
that happens also because of the psyche

2746.8 --> 2751.9
because of her personal Journey because

2749.079 --> 2756.7200000000003
of dealing with stress

2751.9 --> 2761.079
it's gonna happen you're gonna have to

2756.72 --> 2763.4199999999996
concede it's there to stay Forever Until

2761.079 --> 2765.819
the End of Time

2763.42 --> 2768.7200000000003
if you live you're going to have to deal

2765.819 --> 2768.72
with being sick

2768.88 --> 2771.78
get over it

2772.66 --> 2780.5989999999997
I've actually yeah found an appreciation

2777.64 --> 2780.5989999999997
for its function

2798.4 --> 2800.64
foreign

2806.7 --> 2810.5989999999997
CPS what cure

2830.02 --> 2835.66
right

2832.96 --> 2838.839
yeah all these fees are doing is

2835.66 --> 2841.839
disrupting the normal processes that are

2838.839 --> 2844.66
involved in the metabolic cycle of the

2841.839 --> 2848.2599999999998
flu and the cold

2844.66 --> 2850.72
it disrupts it because they try to take

2848.26 --> 2853.3590000000004
control over it

2850.72 --> 2856.54
based on a false presupposition that it

2853.359 --> 2859.54
is some kind of an invasive agent

2856.54 --> 2862.859
so they disrupt the natural immunity

2859.54 --> 2862.859
cycle effectively

2876.18 --> 2879.72
okay CPS

2881.74 --> 2884.74
foreign

2905.559 --> 2910.059
transhumanism

2908.44 --> 2913.359
well that's

2910.059 --> 2916.9
like the ideology in a way that drives

2913.359 --> 2920.2
it yes lamel forever transhumanism

2916.9 --> 2922.2000000000003
it's just the assumption that the human

2920.2 --> 2924.5789999999997
design can be

2922.2 --> 2928.8999999999996
dramatically improved upon and

2924.579 --> 2932.1600000000003
conditions we see or we've learned to

2928.9 --> 2937.14
see as in favorable because of our

2932.16 --> 2937.14
natural luxury way of life

2937.3 --> 2941.5
and counts for a whole bunch of humans

2939.22 --> 2943.66
and the mindset that comes with it we

2941.5 --> 2945.52
start to become convinced that we can

2943.66 --> 2948.64
just edit out

2945.52 --> 2950.619
certain things that we dislike when we

2948.64 --> 2953.46
experience them right that's part of

2950.619 --> 2953.46
transhumanism

2958.78 --> 2964.559
and like the craziest ideas come forth

2961.599 --> 2964.559
from that with some people

2967.0 --> 2972.819
they just think like oh no it's

2970.119 --> 2974.859
the design is flawed

2972.819 --> 2977.68
we can just

2974.859 --> 2980.0789999999997
get rid of this part nothing is going

2977.68 --> 2982.5989999999997
wrong because nobody designed it it's

2980.079 --> 2984.28
all just random atheist

2982.599 --> 2986.44
garbage

2984.28 --> 2990.3390000000004
evolution

2986.44 --> 2992.92
and so we can just do that

2990.339 --> 2995.0789999999997
it's not like it was there for a

2992.92 --> 2996.7000000000003
specific reason in the overall design or

2995.079 --> 3000.0
anything right because they don't have

2996.7 --> 3003.72
that philosophical objection

3000.0 --> 3005.46
and so they make things worse every

3003.72 --> 3007.2599999999998
single step

3005.46 --> 3010.38
it's what they do

3007.26 --> 3012.2400000000002
and then that making things worse

3010.38 --> 3015.3
helps them

3012.24 --> 3018.0
attain more people that are dependent

3015.3 --> 3021.059
towards them after they've effectively

3018.0 --> 3024.319
mutilated themselves because of some

3021.059 --> 3024.3190000000004
Fantastical ideology

3024.359 --> 3029.66
so they become even more slavish

3027.119 --> 3029.6600000000003
right

3032.339 --> 3037.38
because you can't admit it that you all

3034.74 --> 3039.839
did it because of a lie that you

3037.38 --> 3042.48
literally mutilated yourself because of

3039.839 --> 3043.7999999999997
a foolish notion

3042.48 --> 3046.44
that's

3043.8 --> 3048.119
too horrific a realization for most

3046.44 --> 3051.78
people to handle

3048.119 --> 3053.42
like they cannot handle that

3051.78 --> 3056.76
they would rather

3053.42 --> 3058.859
continuously devastate their own lives

3056.76 --> 3063.7400000000002
and their lives of others

3058.859 --> 3063.74
to try to avoid that realization

3072.0 --> 3077.339
didn't DNA show Evolution no Bobby

3074.819 --> 3081.02
steals no we didn't

3077.339 --> 3081.02
couldn't be more wrong

3083.099 --> 3090.079
if anything it showed Beyond a singled

3086.7 --> 3093.8999999999996
out it has to be designed every

3090.079 --> 3097.26
conceivable part of it was designed and

3093.9 --> 3101.819
it was probably originally better

3097.26 --> 3105.48
right it was better it has degenerated

3101.819 --> 3106.619
the original design of us was even

3105.48 --> 3109.26
better

3106.619 --> 3112.079
it's degenerated through entropy for

3109.26 --> 3116.1800000000003
through interference through poisoning

3112.079 --> 3116.1800000000003
consecutive we don't even know

3116.28 --> 3120.3590000000004
like how good it was it might

3119.339 --> 3123.2999999999997
it

3120.359 --> 3126.54
who knows maybe it could restore

3123.3 --> 3129.599
but not through our doing

3126.54 --> 3131.7599999999998
not through our interference through our

3129.599 --> 3134.7200000000003
engineering it's not going to restore to

3131.76 --> 3134.7200000000003
its original design

3138.359 --> 3141.359
foreign

3144.66 --> 3147.66
no

3148.8 --> 3151.819
that's [ __ ]

3165.359 --> 3172.0989999999997
now it's absolutely impossible evolution

3168.96 --> 3172.099
is the most

3172.579 --> 3177.9
incorrect

3174.44 --> 3181.7400000000002
conception about how life works there's

3177.9 --> 3184.26
probably ever been made up it's like

3181.74 --> 3187.14
just as ridiculous as the globe model

3184.26 --> 3190.0200000000004
like how the globe model literally turns

3187.14 --> 3193.98
everything inside out turns physics

3190.02 --> 3197.52
Inside Out violates fundamental laws in

3193.98 --> 3201.119
its design in its idea so does evolution

3197.52 --> 3203.099
in every conceivable way like nothing

3201.119 --> 3204.2400000000002
indicates that Evolution can work

3203.099 --> 3208.38
nothing

3204.24 --> 3212.4199999999996
any mutation any mutation always leads

3208.38 --> 3212.42
to further degeneration always

3215.76 --> 3222.5400000000004
either it bypasses the mutation and

3219.359 --> 3225.0589999999997
restores or it stays makes everything

3222.54 --> 3227.96
worse eventually leading to infertility

3225.059 --> 3227.96
and insanity

3228.66 --> 3235.14
and death

3230.4 --> 3237.7400000000002
it's like no Evolution does not exist

3235.14 --> 3237.74
at all

3239.94 --> 3242.54
thank you

3247.319 --> 3253.339
okay terminoid that's

3249.3 --> 3253.3390000000004
that's we don't need to know that thanks

3259.68 --> 3265.16
okay Devil's puppet is obviously an

3262.559 --> 3265.1600000000003
anti-flatter

3267.2 --> 3270.35
[Applause]

3282.299 --> 3286.64
oh hello by the way James Mason

3294.38 --> 3300.559
and we can predict everything on a blob

3298.02 --> 3300.559
model

3300.74 --> 3306.4489999999996
that's that's brilliant

3303.36 --> 3306.449
[Music]

3306.96 --> 3309.559
uh

3331.26 --> 3337.26
yeah theory of evolution dude

3334.619 --> 3340.079
when

3337.26 --> 3342.2990000000004
Darwin allegedly came up with it it's

3340.079 --> 3344.46
very likely he I don't think that guy

3342.299 --> 3347.22
ever came up with anything ever I think

3344.46 --> 3348.839
he stole every idea he ever had it was

3347.22 --> 3351.7799999999997
that kind of type

3348.839 --> 3353.46
but he must have been like seriously

3351.78 --> 3357.2000000000003
tripping balls

3353.46 --> 3357.2
the time where he actually

3357.359 --> 3361.5
like

3358.74 --> 3365.7
was arguing for evolution just like

3361.5 --> 3367.92
pointing like this changes into that has

3365.7 --> 3371.3999999999996
to be all right he must have literally

3367.92 --> 3373.859
been tripping balls like the whole way

3371.4 --> 3376.4
I think that Darwin was clinically

3373.859 --> 3376.4
insane

3379.5 --> 3384.119
like actually insane clinically

3394.619 --> 3400.619
why would there be empty letters you

3397.26 --> 3403.44
don't even know that wow

3400.619 --> 3405.119
okay well it could just be a numpty

3403.44 --> 3408.02
you don't know any better

3405.119 --> 3408.02
that could be it

3409.02 --> 3413.88
but yeah you're a lingo so far suggests

3411.9 --> 3415.799
you're an anti-flat earther and if you

3413.88 --> 3417.78
don't know what that means

3415.799 --> 3419.579
well then you have haven't been kept

3417.78 --> 3420.78
keeping up to date with the Flat Earth

3419.579 --> 3423.8590000000004
debate

3420.78 --> 3423.8590000000004
Devil's pulprit

3430.74 --> 3438.299
DNA sequences of different what no no

3435.059 --> 3442.26
it's not bad karma

3438.299 --> 3444.68
now you are fake your ideas are fake and

3442.26 --> 3444.6800000000003
false

3445.26 --> 3448.2200000000003
it's ridiculous

3448.44 --> 3458.66
the DNA sequences prove that the entire

3453.02 --> 3458.66
life system is designed

3459.0 --> 3466.38
it cannot randomly order itself the way

3463.079 --> 3470.46
it has in order to randomly form

3466.38 --> 3474.26
everything it did no it had to be

3470.46 --> 3474.26
designed it's a design system

3474.72 --> 3481.5589999999997
nothing about it matches Evolution

3477.059 --> 3483.9
nothing not a single fraction not a

3481.559 --> 3487.38
single fraction of Life anything about

3483.9 --> 3489.54
it proves Evolution not a single thing

3487.38 --> 3492.0
not a single thing

3489.54 --> 3493.92
anything it proves exactly the opposite

3492.0 --> 3496.079
right there is something like adaption

3493.92 --> 3499.02
adaptation

3496.079 --> 3501.0
which Falls within the genetic

3499.02 --> 3504.5
maneuverability

3501.0 --> 3507.72
literally and that's not a mutation

3504.5 --> 3511.319
that's being able to go back and forth

3507.72 --> 3513.72
within the very pool of the design which

3511.319 --> 3516.24
it is a design because you can go

3513.72 --> 3518.0989999999997
further away from the core design and

3516.24 --> 3521.8999999999996
you can get closer to the Core Design

3518.099 --> 3521.9
proving it is a design

3522.18 --> 3529.02
nothing proves Evolution nothing it's

3526.02 --> 3533.22
all a bunch of hallucinatory blabbering

3529.02 --> 3536.42
idiocy from some 19th century insane

3533.22 --> 3536.4199999999996
raving Madman

not 1pm as I normally do but who knows

3603.96 --> 3608.46
maybe it'll just all turn around again

3605.76 --> 3612.1800000000003
every time I try to like pin myself down

3608.46 --> 3614.339
I always like have to get it wrong on

3612.18 --> 3616.68
purpose for some weird

3614.339 --> 3619.98
subconscious reason

3616.68 --> 3623.72
like like I somehow refused to be pinned

3619.98 --> 3627.66
down even by myself it's weird

3623.72 --> 3629.8799999999997
but I will be back nonetheless tomorrow

3627.66 --> 3634.02
on the Friday show

3629.88 --> 3636.6800000000003
so I hope to see you all there

3634.02 --> 3640.14
uh yeah you might find me in Discord

3636.68 --> 3642.66
after the fvdf the show is over because

3640.14 --> 3645.98
yeah I'm not gonna get involved I said I

3642.66 --> 3645.98
wouldn't and I'm I'm not

3646.38 --> 3651.78
so

3648.24 --> 3654.4199999999996
but yeah tomorrow I will get back to uh

3651.78 --> 3657.599
Flat Earth debate

3654.42 --> 3661.94
because then a week's passed right so

3657.599 --> 3693.04
until the next video keep it flat
