6.65 --> 36.719
[Music]

37.79 --> 45.39
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.03 --> 47.67
early-bird number 213

45.39 --> 49.38
I'm your host Arwen and before we start

47.67 --> 51.900000000000006
the show please don't forget to share it

49.38 --> 53.64
on any platform you deem fit and also if

51.9 --> 55.35
you haven't already please subscribe to

53.64 --> 57.93
my channel and hit the bell notification

55.35 --> 62.52
so you know when I'm going life which is

57.93 --> 65.7
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time so the

62.52 --> 69.96000000000001
weather today is a little better no not

65.7 --> 74.61
much it's a bit rain bit cloudy giant

69.96 --> 78.58999999999999
chemtrail visible and a small blue light

74.61 --> 80.729
there so it could be better lot windier

78.59 --> 87.06
weirdly enough in the middle of the

80.729 --> 94.05
night it was wind still and clear but

87.06 --> 97.98
yeah so yeah today it's not such a good

94.05 --> 106.47
day yesterday was a blast pretty much

97.98 --> 110.10000000000001
until 12 o'clock hit and yeah then Randy

106.47 --> 111.92999999999999
somewhere started up hang out and I got

110.1 --> 115.82
to find out that apparently Patricia

111.93 --> 121.64000000000001
complete well I found out before that

115.82 --> 121.63999999999999
was it chocolate saying

126.27 --> 131.67
anyway somebody figured out no it was

132.21 --> 144.51000000000002
yeah it was bad Christian or Bible

136.45 --> 151.89999999999998
literalist yeah quite a quite a bummer

144.51 --> 156.39999999999998
and even worse is that now apparently a

151.9 --> 159.13
lot of people have just lost it they've

156.4 --> 163.48000000000002
helped back pressures and now they're

159.13 --> 170.85
it's like a witch burning its total

163.48 --> 174.82
paranoia and just gushing mania like and

170.85 --> 177.66
in a way unfortunately this is logical

174.82 --> 184.29999999999998
because we are all under severe pressure

177.66 --> 187.18
from every direction and yeah that tends

184.3 --> 190.269
to cause that if you feel betrayed by

187.18 --> 193.66
somebody and you're not very careful

190.269 --> 196.57
you're you want to let go of the

193.66 --> 199.32999999999998
psychological warfare defenses then you

196.57 --> 202.32999999999998
will end up all just jumping on and

199.33 --> 204.97
start hammering and that's a group

202.33 --> 207.31
effect and unfortunately there's a lot

204.97 --> 209.8
of people that have engaged in this

207.31 --> 212.47
including somebody that I kind of

209.8 --> 216.4
thought was my friend until I asked them

212.47 --> 219.82
like yeah could you please stop doing

216.4 --> 223.09
that you know I consider her my friend

219.82 --> 226.87
and I find it very aggravating that you

223.09 --> 231.73000000000002
keep on gushing on and actually posting

226.87 --> 235.33
troll videos it's just yeah there is a

231.73 --> 237.91
lot to talk about concerning concerning

235.33 --> 240.13000000000002
Patricia and I'm actually now going to

237.91 --> 243.459
dedicate this entire hangout to that

240.13 --> 250.14
because Patricia was absolutely not a

243.459 --> 252.87
perfect person she had issues okay but

250.14 --> 256.26
the things that people have let the

252.87 --> 259.43
speculation gone and there's people that

256.26 --> 262.98
have been doing this forever

259.43 --> 267.21
it's madness it's absolutely totally out

262.98 --> 270.0
of proportion and yeah I already like to

267.21 --> 273.63
warn people I'm not in a good mood so if

270.0 --> 276.42
you're gonna be doing that [ __ ] and

273.63 --> 279.33
saying there's the truth finally good

276.42 --> 281.88
riddance yeah there's a good chance I'm

279.33 --> 284.64
kind of pretty much ban you out right so

281.88 --> 287.15
I'm just warning everyone because I'm

284.64 --> 291.65999999999997
really pissed off by this just this

287.15 --> 294.29999999999995
indecency and then I'm gonna start

291.66 --> 296.46000000000004
addressing Patricia because she

294.3 --> 300.95
sometimes had kind of indecent things

296.46 --> 304.46999999999997
she did as well and that always kind of

300.95 --> 308.72999999999996
bugged me like Patricia why are you

304.47 --> 313.44000000000005
doing this and then in my own personal

308.73 --> 317.81
reason as I figured out sensing out who

313.44 --> 317.81
Patricia really is it just seems like

319.19 --> 327.419
it's almost an impulsive naivety that

324.02 --> 329.28
she kind of like I don't know why any

327.419 --> 331.919
other way to how to describe it but goes

329.28 --> 334.32
in female mode and just starts to

331.919 --> 338.24
blatantly say exactly what is in her

334.32 --> 343.28
mind without any kind of moderation or

338.24 --> 345.66
social sensibility especially when she's

343.28 --> 347.64
frustrated she does that and then

345.66 --> 349.44
sometimes really stupid things come out

347.64 --> 351.65999999999997
like you do all this you don't kill

349.44 --> 356.96999999999997
themselves or something or she gets

351.66 --> 358.97900000000004
really into like acting for fun like a

356.97 --> 360.81
witch and then she overdoes it and she

358.979 --> 364.2
actually says something really creepy

360.81 --> 368.01
and then that [ __ ] it's like that's her

364.2 --> 371.71999999999997
person that is her issue it's kind of

368.01 --> 374.15
like feeling it out she's

371.72 --> 376.37
she just does that but I don't see any

374.15 --> 380.47999999999996
note and nefarious nature and it really

376.37 --> 385.73
it's just a minus point on a character

380.48 --> 387.47
to me and yeah and then of course mark

385.73 --> 389.8
Sargent while he's still here of course

387.47 --> 394.19000000000005
and the mark sergeant knows who he is

389.8 --> 396.8
yeah he is as much he's compared to

394.19 --> 399.46999999999997
Patricia much more confident so he knew

396.8 --> 403.07
what he was getting into or as soon as

399.47 --> 406.19000000000005
he really started to do the flat

403.07 --> 407.63
yeah the flat earth clues and everything

406.19 --> 411.02
he knew what he was getting into I

407.63 --> 413.3
really am certain about that he knew he

411.02 --> 417.74
was gonna get flooded by trolls probably

413.3 --> 421.07
until the end of his life so and

417.74 --> 423.2
Patricia wasn't really like that I

421.07 --> 426.08
really got the feeling with Patricia

423.2 --> 428.65999999999997
that she was just she just wanted some

426.08 --> 431.18
attention and she wanted to apply your

428.66 --> 437.63000000000005
skill and find friends and her

431.18 --> 440.27
motivation at that was maybe not even as

437.63 --> 443.99
idealistic as a lot of people that get

440.27 --> 447.28999999999996
into Flat Earth become they're like yeah

443.99 --> 450.95
we have to really fight against the evil

447.29 --> 453.11
I don't think she even she was aware of

450.95 --> 455.57
that but she it was much more like yeah

453.11 --> 458.6
we just got to make like a family and

455.57 --> 461.39
she always emphasized that so her her

458.6 --> 464.68
motivation her real motivation was

461.39 --> 467.9
really the community rather than this

464.68 --> 472.31
yeah this battle and she didn't like

467.9 --> 474.58
battle at all alright so that's how you

472.31 --> 474.58
do that

478.13 --> 486.5
yeah Rasta your comments are showing but

480.68 --> 491.3
I'm talking now and you in chat ok don't

486.5 --> 494.24
don't demand that I'm just gonna read

491.3 --> 500.93
whatever you're gonna say please oh yeah

494.24 --> 504.68
I agree about PJ PJ he's he's at the

500.93 --> 506.90000000000003
core or at the foundation of the people

504.68 --> 507.98
that have been doing that [ __ ] Patricia

506.9 --> 512.84
from the start

507.98 --> 516.349
and he's unrepentant and that means it's

512.84 --> 518.27
time for him to go doesn't mean that

516.349 --> 525.5300000000001
he's got to die of course but it means

518.27 --> 526.4
that yeah he is no longer welcome as far

525.53 --> 530.4499999999999
as I'm concerned

526.4 --> 532.43
oh sorry rested it's just sorry

530.45 --> 542.75
well I did tell you I'm kind of

532.43 --> 547.31
irritated today sorry about that but

542.75 --> 550.34
yeah PJ what an idiot and I already had

547.31 --> 554.4699999999999
was very clear about this with Antonia

550.34 --> 559.07
cigarettes because I consider him like

554.47 --> 568.82
well he may not be a hill but he is as a

559.07 --> 572.48
natural-born saboteur and not yeah not

568.82 --> 575.99
welcome and and nothing he does really

572.48 --> 579.62
cuts what he's literally pretending to

575.99 --> 582.2
be very down-to-earth and then making

579.62 --> 588.77
very subtle pseudoscience things with

582.2 --> 592.57
that very subtly but also blatantly

588.77 --> 596.38
really trying to control the whole thing

592.57 --> 600.2900000000001
and not really look for truth not

596.38 --> 604.91
sometimes he's but he's doing his own

600.29 --> 606.3299999999999
thing and he is very hostile

604.91 --> 607.98
really

606.33 --> 620.4300000000001
although he's very good at acting that

607.98 --> 624.6
he's friendly so PJ is just PJ is just

620.43 --> 627.39
an idiot he has some funny foundational

624.6 --> 631.6800000000001
ideas and he just doesn't do [ __ ] with

627.39 --> 633.72
it just keeps on talking the same [ __ ]

631.68 --> 636.18
and he never does it it's like so

633.72 --> 640.0500000000001
pathetic that you can have a a decent

636.18 --> 642.75
idea and then just do nothing with it

640.05 --> 646.9699999999999
except bother and spam everyone with it

642.75 --> 646.97
right Jason mcCormick

654.22 --> 657.879
[Music]

665.52 --> 668.36
that's wrong

673.74 --> 696.49
look if you're gonna be like that then

679.6 --> 700.53
at least be a little bit more subtle no

696.49 --> 708.0600000000001
but really I shouldn't even do this but

700.53 --> 713.97
the thing with PJ he is such a shameless

708.06 --> 718.1199999999999
coward as weasel like how I imagined ah

713.97 --> 722.4100000000001
just like no no he's not gonna get like

718.12 --> 724.15
kill their suicide know that know what I

722.41 --> 728.3399999999999
think would probably happen is that at

724.15 --> 733.6899999999999
some point he just like gets a cut or

728.34 --> 736.8100000000001
like nail in his feet and then he just

733.69 --> 740.44
gets gangrene and dies of it like

736.81 --> 744.0999999999999
something really disgusting that is how

740.44 --> 748.5100000000001
I kind of imagined be shed and just

744.1 --> 750.61
complete it would be very fitting to his

748.51 --> 754.03
overall attitude and there is some

750.61 --> 756.3100000000001
energy resonance with that concept so I

754.03 --> 763.27
might actually be on to something who

756.31 --> 765.8499999999999
knows but yeah PJ is but let's not make

763.27 --> 770.5
it about these bastards that have

765.85 --> 778.3000000000001
basically been bullying this pretty

770.5 --> 783.13
sensitive woman for what is it for five

778.3 --> 786.8499999999999
years and then we're really trying I

783.13 --> 790.42
kept track talking about daily or weekly

786.85 --> 793.27
basis and multiple people and then there

790.42 --> 795.67
is just the sock trolls doing [ __ ] it's

793.27 --> 798.5799999999999
more superficial but they're like great

795.67 --> 801.76
made real projects that try to break her

798.58 --> 804.97
down to really it's so sadistic and the

801.76 --> 808.16
problem with Tricia's is that she's just

804.97 --> 814.28
she doesn't have the sister she doesn't

808.16 --> 816.8
have the the mindset the the will to

814.28 --> 820.43
really defend herself properly against

816.8 --> 826.39
it because as soon as she tries that

820.43 --> 828.68
their anger just unravels the control of

826.39 --> 832.1899999999999
whatever she's trying to chief I think

828.68 --> 833.9
that is her issue and you can't really

832.19 --> 837.8900000000001
blame her for it because that's just

833.9 --> 842.87
like she say she's a tiny lady this is a

837.89 --> 846.17
tiny cute lady and that typically just

842.87 --> 848.0600000000001
that's logical and it's kind of funny

846.17 --> 850.13
though because like on her on their

848.06 --> 853.04
hangouts she always had the camera from

850.13 --> 855.41
down and that made her kind of look a

853.04 --> 857.81
lot bigger than she really was because

855.41 --> 860.7199999999999
like if I would be face to face with her

857.81 --> 864.77
she would be probably like this big this

860.72 --> 871.69
is a really tiny cute lady and that

864.77 --> 875.81
really matters a lot in how your social

871.69 --> 878.6600000000001
skills are gonna develop like tiny

875.81 --> 881.9899999999999
ladies either are totally aggressive and

878.66 --> 887.87
snappy and very good at it or there's

881.99 --> 892.69
like super passive that that's what I've

887.87 --> 892.69
noticed but yeah

894.93 --> 897.93
did

898.13 --> 905.42
yeah it usually turns out to be either

900.44 --> 907.4300000000001
of that I don't know maybe maybe I'm

905.42 --> 909.4699999999999
just doing wet finger work based on my

907.43 --> 914.81
own experience is not like I've known so

909.47 --> 916.6700000000001
many people that well yeah well Patricia

914.81 --> 919.4899999999999
did get a lot more hate than she

916.67 --> 925.43
deserved absolutely and there were

919.49 --> 927.949
issues with her and she didn't like

925.43 --> 929.7199999999999
during the whole process she was busy a

927.949 --> 931.81
lot and she learned a lot she learned a

929.72 --> 935.99
lot of technical she learned a lot about

931.81 --> 942.7299999999999
social dealings but I didn't get the

935.99 --> 946.04
feeling that she took care of her own

942.73 --> 949.399
personality issues like she wanted that

946.04 --> 953.329
to be able to be there she didn't want

949.399 --> 955.43
to change that I think and that can

953.329 --> 958.819
definitely rub people the wrong way it

955.43 --> 960.5
kind of rubbed me the wrong way but yeah

958.819 --> 963.8
what are you gonna do or you just gonna

960.5 --> 966.23
then become an [ __ ] and start

963.8 --> 970.399
dividing [ __ ] no I didn't see really

966.23 --> 972.8000000000001
harm in her and yeah she can draw people

970.399 --> 975.079
the wrong way with the way she conducts

972.8 --> 979.31
herself sometimes especially in certain

975.079 --> 982.2399999999999
moods but everyone has these type of

979.31 --> 982.2399999999999
tendencies

985.82 --> 991.46
and also there I'm pretty sure that

989.69 --> 994.0100000000001
there were a lot more things that

991.46 --> 996.0500000000001
Patricia was dealing with in her own

994.01 --> 999.35
life that she wouldn't ever talk about

996.05 --> 1002.3499999999999
and she probably had some tensions from

999.35 --> 1004.6
that as well and because in one way

1002.35 --> 1013.78
Patricia is very open but in the other

1004.6 --> 1016.84
way I think she's very private and how I

1013.78 --> 1020.29
deduced that is based on that she at

1016.84 --> 1025.21
times was very proficient at deflecting

1020.29 --> 1027.34
things very charmingly like in in the

1025.21 --> 1030.04
reflex moment when you felt that there

1027.34 --> 1034.06
was some real issue that she didn't want

1030.04 --> 1036.76
to be that she didn't want to share so

1034.06 --> 1042.25
she probably was very private about a

1036.76 --> 1045.43
lot of things but again does that make

1042.25 --> 1048.58
her evil no does that make her a [ __ ]

1045.43 --> 1052.69
or a shill absolutely not

1048.58 --> 1055.9299999999998
and to be fair let's just get down down

1052.69 --> 1058.75
to the nitty-gritty okay the the [ __ ]

1055.93 --> 1061.45
thing right so what is this based on

1058.75 --> 1064.8
this is based on supposed a testimony

1061.45 --> 1070.47
from Antonio su barrettes a very creepy

1064.8 --> 1073.8999999999999
sociopath guy that yeah has no problem

1070.47 --> 1076.63
betraying people with a smile and then

1073.9 --> 1079.0600000000002
even acting out like he has feelings

1076.63 --> 1082.2600000000002
about it to make it look natural if that

1079.06 --> 1088.56
guy is a total creep so there's that

1082.26 --> 1092.71
then yeah Patricia takes very it's very

1088.56 --> 1094.9299999999998
meticulous about her looks takes a lot

1092.71 --> 1097.45
of effort in that also is like oh yeah

1094.93 --> 1100.8700000000001
could that be used to cover up that she

1097.45 --> 1104.5900000000001
actually is a [ __ ] well can it really

1100.87 --> 1108.9399999999998
I don't know have you ever seen a [ __ ]

1104.59 --> 1112.6299999999999
and then that without their makeup they

1108.94 --> 1114.31
look like a male or something and then

1112.63 --> 1117.13
with their makeup they wouldn't look

1114.31 --> 1119.29
like a woman really because I've never

1117.13 --> 1122.7700000000002
seen that either a [ __ ] is

1119.29 --> 1124.36
just models or naturally looking in a

1122.77 --> 1126.43
way and then modified in a way that it

1124.36 --> 1128.7099999999998
really looks female either with good

1126.43 --> 1131.6100000000001
makeup or not with good makeup or they

1128.71 --> 1135.91
just look like a guy with some weird

1131.61 --> 1137.85
feminine features that I do look like oh

1135.91 --> 1142.2900000000002
I'm a woman

1137.85 --> 1146.1699999999998
totally dissonant or they just look like

1142.29 --> 1148.42
weird guys sorry there's no insult

1146.17 --> 1151.21
intended but that's just the way it is

1148.42 --> 1155.38
and Patricia just definitely looked like

1151.21 --> 1158.23
a woman so yeah how could then

1155.38 --> 1162.22
eventually I still had like a thing that

1158.23 --> 1163.92
at some point just to get it out of the

1162.22 --> 1166.39
way almost like get this conspiracy

1163.92 --> 1169.0900000000001
buried forever is to basically

1166.39 --> 1171.2800000000002
personally approach her in the more if

1169.09 --> 1175.4199999999998
we could develop a better friendship and

1171.28 --> 1179.2
then say look can you just go with me

1175.42 --> 1183.67
and I'll take a genetic sample and we'll

1179.2 --> 1188.13
do a DNA test on you for male female

1183.67 --> 1192.7
chromosome situation and I'll do it and

1188.13 --> 1195.19
right and then who knows you know look

1192.7 --> 1198.94
the thing is she might actually

1195.19 --> 1201.99
technically despite all of it turn out

1198.94 --> 1209.56
to be a transsexual after all well I

1201.99 --> 1213.4
wouldn't really care cuz yeah she like

1209.56 --> 1215.23
pretending to be a female that for

1213.4 --> 1222.73
example could have kids or something no

1215.23 --> 1225.64
she's she's like you know she's moved

1222.73 --> 1230.59
beyond that stage hormonal II and

1225.64 --> 1232.8100000000002
everything so yeah then it's kind of

1230.59 --> 1235.57
like okay if that were to be the case

1232.81 --> 1239.98
then yes she would be covering that up a

1235.57 --> 1242.53
lot but on the other hand the whole deal

1239.98 --> 1245.47
with actual being transsexual is that

1242.53 --> 1247.51
you're being interpreted as female so if

1245.47 --> 1249.31
you're already have everything with you

1247.51 --> 1252.16
then it wouldn't be surprising that if

1249.31 --> 1252.9089999999999
you were that that you really would put

1252.16 --> 1254.499
everything on

1252.909 --> 1259.96
everything to make sure that everyone

1254.499 --> 1262.8990000000001
believed that except for direct

1259.96 --> 1270.3400000000001
in-your-face proof because that wouldn't

1262.899 --> 1271.149
work so I still can't blame her either

1270.34 --> 1275.47
way

1271.149 --> 1279.4889999999998
although yeah it's look it's very simple

1275.47 --> 1284.08
I just don't believe in her like she is

1279.489 --> 1288.97
a pure champion like the pure champion

1284.08 --> 1292.389
that'll be our Savior you know she is a

1288.97 --> 1298.45
lady she had skills she had very good

1292.389 --> 1301.269
will she was very charming in my opinion

1298.45 --> 1303.099
and she was getting a lot of people

1301.269 --> 1306.369
connected and that's just what she did

1303.099 --> 1311.22
and the rest is all conjecture as far as

1306.369 --> 1311.22
I'm concerned you know

1318.73 --> 1323.77
so but anyway you had the whole thing I

1320.98 --> 1325.66
just talked about that's just that is

1323.77 --> 1328.6299999999999
just technical speculation because I

1325.66 --> 1331.48
really don't think that she is and I

1328.63 --> 1334.24
probably would fold out fall back on

1331.48 --> 1336.75
that pretty quickly if I ever met her in

1334.24 --> 1341.65
person because my sense of smell is

1336.75 --> 1345.13
quite keen at that like it don't even

1341.65 --> 1349.18
have to do a bite in friendly school no

1345.13 --> 1352.18
I can smell that at a distance just I

1349.18 --> 1353.8300000000002
don't know I'm I send all my senses are

1352.18 --> 1355.69
just very strong and I learned to

1353.83 --> 1359.82
basically utilize them I don't know

1355.69 --> 1359.8200000000002
maybe it's weird a lot of people

1362.96 --> 1372.75
[Music]

1365.21 --> 1381.17
yeah so is this chat still going maybe

1372.75 --> 1381.17
you guys I just freaked out now hello

1398.149 --> 1405.7689999999998
ah spider-sense well you know I do have

1401.689 --> 1408.679
a warning sense and you could compare it

1405.769 --> 1410.299
very much to the spider sense except

1408.679 --> 1412.479
with the spider sense it's much more

1410.299 --> 1417.709
dramatic it's almost like a

1412.479 --> 1419.779
hallucination impulse that just

1417.709 --> 1423.949
overcomes the consciousness that's how

1419.779 --> 1426.349
it's usually represented my spider sense

1423.949 --> 1430.969
works different it's more like a signal

1426.349 --> 1438.379
like a light going off inside my inside

1430.969 --> 1439.8790000000001
me it's just yeah that just tells me

1438.379 --> 1442.9989999999998
like there [ __ ] coming and I'm

1439.879 --> 1445.4889999999998
immediately I'll be like and it'll

1442.999 --> 1448.339
usually be based on indeed something

1445.489 --> 1451.489
moving very fast towards me and it works

1448.339 --> 1453.769
it works every single time like I go on

1451.489 --> 1457.219
my bicycle in the city and there's birds

1453.769 --> 1460.069
all over the place you know like big

1457.219 --> 1462.1390000000001
pigeons and [ __ ] and they're reckless

1460.069 --> 1463.879
sometimes sometimes they get in a bit

1462.139 --> 1466.579
Daisy mood and they just look earlier

1463.879 --> 1468.7389999999998
and they get killed by that as well

1466.579 --> 1470.599
getting smashing against truck but

1468.739 --> 1473.809
they'll fly you're straight into your

1470.599 --> 1475.879
face if you're not paying attention if

1473.809 --> 1478.249
you're like on your mobile yeah that's

1475.879 --> 1480.889
how this fly straight in your face if

1478.249 --> 1483.709
you're not careful well when I go around

1480.889 --> 1485.6589999999999
it's just like and just pay dreaming

1483.709 --> 1487.519
around looking at something staring the

1485.659 --> 1490.459
distance and suddenly I'll see something

1487.519 --> 1494.109
moving it's like and immediately like a

1490.459 --> 1496.759
cat it's just like I see its trajectory

1494.109 --> 1498.4389999999999
according to my position and nothing

1496.759 --> 1500.599
else everything is just like a white

1498.439 --> 1502.8490000000002
light in the backdrop as it has become

1500.599 --> 1505.269
and I'll just be immediately able to

1502.849 --> 1508.9389999999999
coordinate and keep my balance instantly

1505.269 --> 1510.889
in like a quarter of a second and I've

1508.939 --> 1513.799
never been hit to the face by a bird

1510.889 --> 1519.549
that way even though it can it happens

1513.799 --> 1519.549
on a weekly basis sometimes yeah

1526.75 --> 1539.48
lolz yeah well re naka bumble the thing

1534.05 --> 1544.72
is about perfumes they can put something

1539.48 --> 1547.55
on top of the person smell natural smell

1544.72 --> 1550.88
but unless it's like really strong and

1547.55 --> 1554.3
fresh and literally just like overwhelms

1550.88 --> 1556.3100000000002
the senses if it's just around I you can

1554.3 --> 1564.56
smell everything through that a dog can

1556.31 --> 1568.1
I can so I could definitely feel the

1564.56 --> 1569.57
difference between a man or smelled the

1568.1 --> 1573.85
difference between a man and the women

1569.57 --> 1577.8799999999999
and even between like a real real man

1573.85 --> 1580.4599999999998
that yeah they have better do a lot of

1577.88 --> 1586.5500000000002
physical stuff and are like serious and

1580.46 --> 1588.94
a soy boy the smell is distinct I don't

1586.55 --> 1588.94
know it just

1596.79 --> 1602.84
you know most perfume perfumes and [ __ ]

1600.179 --> 1607.3400000000001
when they wear off

1602.84 --> 1612.6499999999999
they literally smell like piss to me

1607.34 --> 1612.6499999999999
it's it's disgusting

1617.23 --> 1623.84
pheromone masking agents right well okay

1620.02 --> 1626.96
if she's that fanatical about or if

1623.84 --> 1631.55
anyone would be that fanatical fanatical

1626.96 --> 1634.46
about completely masking all the sensory

1631.55 --> 1641.36
things that could give away their their

1634.46 --> 1644.24
original gender nature I don't know if

1641.36 --> 1649.1799999999998
I'd have to test that if I could smell

1644.24 --> 1649.18
the difference or whatever I don't know

1649.54 --> 1654.95
look I'm not saying that it would be

1652.46 --> 1657.32
absolutely impossible to fool me with

1654.95 --> 1660.3400000000001
something like that but it's not gonna

1657.32 --> 1660.34
be easy so

1666.67 --> 1673.24
you know the thing is about it all in

1670.929 --> 1675.94
the end for myself I really don't care

1673.24 --> 1678.79
that much all I really care about with a

1675.94 --> 1681.91
woman eventually is that they can

1678.79 --> 1692.5
African kids and that's well that's a

1681.91 --> 1698.17
sure way to find out you know at it if

1692.5 --> 1700.96
they put in for a right right yeah yeah

1698.17 --> 1703.53
sorry rest I and I'm jumbling it up

1700.96 --> 1707.919
sometimes don't worry about it

1703.53 --> 1711.97
don't worry it's all good yeah thanks

1707.919 --> 1714.22
everyone chat for behaving I appreciate

1711.97 --> 1721.299
it I don't know if you're as bummed out

1714.22 --> 1723.28
about this all as I am just i'm also

1721.299 --> 1725.559
already considering like yeah could she

1723.28 --> 1726.37
could technically do a comeback but what

1725.559 --> 1733.96
would that be like

1726.37 --> 1735.76
because yeah she knows that as soon as

1733.96 --> 1738.78
that happens she will immediately have

1735.76 --> 1742.09
to deal with the trolls again

1738.78 --> 1749.2
immediately and that's not very

1742.09 --> 1750.9099999999999
motivating to even consider so she and

1749.2 --> 1753.25
it is kind of a problem it would have

1750.91 --> 1757.5900000000001
been much better in my in my personal

1753.25 --> 1761.23
opinion if she just said okay guys

1757.59 --> 1764.98
ladies and gentlemen there who normally

1761.23 --> 1768.1
would be a secret show but I am like

1764.98 --> 1771.6100000000001
taking a vacation from YouTube for a

1768.1 --> 1775.54
while like at least two weeks and we'll

1771.61 --> 1777.76
see cuz yeah I'm getting stressed out

1775.54 --> 1782.46
about all the [ __ ] in the background and

1777.76 --> 1786.7
I just can't handle it I'll get back

1782.46 --> 1788.2
don't worry about me say hello and yeah

1786.7 --> 1790.27
then everybody would be

1788.2 --> 1793.3300000000002
oh yeah sure of course that makes

1790.27 --> 1795.75
perfect sense yeah this is awesome or

1793.33 --> 1799.53
not awesome yeah we'll miss you and

1795.75 --> 1802.12
we'll be waiting and she could then just

1799.53 --> 1802.72
yeah get a vacation from all this

1802.12 --> 1805.75
pressure

1802.72 --> 1808.21
I really wish he'd done that maybe

1805.75 --> 1811.45
she'll like get back and be like [ __ ]

1808.21 --> 1818.47
yeah I just blew a fuse let's just do

1811.45 --> 1822.309
that I'd be I totally get it so I hope

1818.47 --> 1824.74
that was actually the real yeah that

1822.309 --> 1829.93
that is that's kind of just like flipped

1824.74 --> 1833.08
out on it and and she will want to and

1829.93 --> 1834.49
be able to restore what happened so that

1833.08 --> 1836.1699999999998
would just know okay she just need a

1834.49 --> 1838.24
break because I think that's really what

1836.17 --> 1841.42
what happened she just needed a real

1838.24 --> 1844.45
serious break and and be able to let it

1841.42 --> 1846.22
all go with her mind and typically just

1844.45 --> 1848.17
throwing it all away deleting is one way

1846.22 --> 1855.51
to achieve that if it's really hard to

1848.17 --> 1855.51
let go just yeah so

1861.18 --> 1885.43
we'll see what happens so yeah you know

1882.43 --> 1888.0600000000002
let me shout out some people and Chad I

1885.43 --> 1888.0600000000002
forgot that part

1888.97 --> 1893.8
right I'll just didn't look in the

1891.37 --> 1896.9499999999998
participants list I see bilji Jason

1893.8 --> 1899.11
mcCormick over muku on a plane or in a

1896.95 --> 1900.97
Colombo Rambo Jambo stop traffic and my

1899.11 --> 1907.87
rest I had the Omega where T and

1900.97 --> 1910.41
truth-seeker mafia 3 6 there may be

1907.87 --> 1910.4099999999999
others

1913.99 --> 1919.61
it's funny sometimes I think that the

1917.809 --> 1921.789
participant list doesn't actually

1919.61 --> 1924.62
register Sokka counts

1921.789 --> 1927.129
it's funny how that works you're not in

1924.62 --> 1927.129
their Weed Man

1928.059 --> 1933.1689999999999
yeah you're not so I think you're a suck

1931.37 --> 1934.61
doesn't mean I'm gonna outright ban you

1933.169 --> 1942.6390000000001
as long as you choose hey if you like a

1934.61 --> 1942.639
normal shock whatever a peanuts Clark

1948.19 --> 1954.43
Oh Oh peanuts Clarke holy [ __ ] I

1951.88 --> 1962.2900000000002
wouldn't give up on you guys like that

1954.43 --> 1964.27
well let's just say I have look I've

1962.29 --> 1967.45
even addressed this like a few days ago

1964.27 --> 1971.05
I in a way I hope that isn't actually

1967.45 --> 1974.26
that she didn't see that and that that

1971.05 --> 1977.77
kind of made her doubt but yeah I

1974.26 --> 1979.06
definitely have these times or I'm just

1977.77 --> 1981.6399999999999
pondering like am i doing the right

1979.06 --> 1985.1499999999999
thing I've had to did that in the open

1981.64 --> 1986.8300000000002
several points it on my show am i doing

1985.15 --> 1990.88
the right thing here because sometimes I

1986.83 --> 1994.09
really feel stuck and already explained

1990.88 --> 1995.7700000000002
yeah if I really want to break out then

1994.09 --> 2000.03
what I'm doing right here is not gonna

1995.77 --> 2005.67
work so yeah I'm not I can't guarantee

2000.03 --> 2009.45
that at at some point I won't just say

2005.67 --> 2012.24
look yeah guys I really love to run but

2009.45 --> 2013.74
I got really important things I need to

2012.24 --> 2020.25
do right now and I can't do the show

2013.74 --> 2023.28
anymore and maybe then try to transfer

2020.25 --> 2025.44
it like to a once per week show or

2023.28 --> 2028.53
something that might happen I don't know

2025.44 --> 2030.18
it all depends nothing laying on the

2028.53 --> 2033.51
schedule right now it's not like I'm

2030.18 --> 2035.0700000000002
trying to prepare you guys that I am

2033.51 --> 2037.28
gonna leave no and I'm just saying like

2035.07 --> 2042.6299999999999
I definitely definitely crossed my mind

2037.28 --> 2048.48
but I would not do a goodbye forever and

2042.63 --> 2050.52
delete my [ __ ] no way no way my look I

2048.48 --> 2055.7
have I have something important to

2050.52 --> 2055.7
accomplish technically and I want

2058.7 --> 2066.049
I didn't maybe it's kind of like vanity

2062.299 --> 2068.03
I don't know but I really like all doing

2066.049 --> 2073.069
this stuff so much that what I really

2068.03 --> 2075.799
want is that eventually when it's all

2073.069 --> 2079.099
getting completely figured out that

2075.799 --> 2082.099
people will think about me and the

2079.099 --> 2087.889
things that I said in the preload and I

2082.099 --> 2092.7400000000002
just I trust in a way but I also hope

2087.889 --> 2097.75
that I really like got it all the way

2092.74 --> 2101.5
from the start like early already bird

2097.75 --> 2106.04
and I think I do

2101.5 --> 2110.27
it's just really surreal and I look even

2106.04 --> 2112.97
in my visions okay I've seen what

2110.27 --> 2116.02
happened when I attained true confidence

2112.97 --> 2119.4199999999996
it's like a separate power and it was

2116.02 --> 2121.49
palpable in the dark world and I

2119.42 --> 2124.309
remember having conversations that I

2121.49 --> 2127.5789999999997
haven't even had yet okay that was weird

2124.309 --> 2130.13
and oh my god like because of that

2127.579 --> 2135.349
confidence because of that ability to

2130.13 --> 2138.6800000000003
wield such refined strength in the face

2135.349 --> 2141.23
of corruption and evade it there's

2138.68 --> 2145.0989999999997
people out there that just gonna be so

2141.23 --> 2147.89
dark over that so I am prepared to it

2145.099 --> 2151.21
it's gonna be to me almost like a like a

2147.89 --> 2154.5789999999997
paladin defending against a race

2151.21 --> 2158.859
everywhere that's what it kind of felt

2154.579 --> 2161.9300000000003
like and I'm well prepared for it it's

2158.859 --> 2166.8489999999997
also part of the thing that kind of

2161.93 --> 2170.4199999999996
fueled my paranoia which I that it's in

2166.849 --> 2172.4300000000003
me but in the beginning stage especially

2170.42 --> 2174.98
even during the flat earth talks at

2172.43 --> 2176.66
times I would be like yeah I'm really

2174.98 --> 2182.39
scared that they're gonna come for me

2176.66 --> 2184.52
well that stems from that from that time

2182.39 --> 2187.79
from the visions from that time when

2184.52 --> 2189.829
[ __ ] got really serious but the problem

2187.79 --> 2192.43
is it was all so mixed up with pure

2189.829 --> 2197.0
threat delusions

2192.43 --> 2200.8999999999996
that were not literal time-based events

2197.0 --> 2203.54
but more imagination-based events it's

2200.9 --> 2205.13
and those have always been that has

2203.54 --> 2207.56
always been the trick to distinguish

2205.13 --> 2211.67
between those two types of vision

2207.56 --> 2214.5499999999997
experience and they were interwoven they

2211.67 --> 2217.9700000000003
were definitely different so I am

2214.55 --> 2223.04
preparing just to hold on and I will

2217.97 --> 2225.23
probably be like I'm gonna continue on

2223.04 --> 2228.56
doing what I do with the holographic

2225.23 --> 2231.77
globe of the heavens concept the

2228.56 --> 2234.14
rectangular looping aspect potential

2231.77 --> 2236.48
worlds out there and my emphasis on the

2234.14 --> 2239.81
missing information about a potential

2236.48 --> 2242.15
dough or yeah what is the container

2239.81 --> 2244.2999999999997
really like all of these things and I

2242.15 --> 2248.87
will keep on doing that and I will be a

2244.3 --> 2250.61
front-runner I think in that

2248.87 --> 2253.2799999999997
specifically that doesn't mean that I

2250.61 --> 2256.79
will be like a frontman in in the media

2253.28 --> 2259.3100000000004
front that is gonna propel a lot of this

2256.79 --> 2261.95
in the wider world because I don't think

2259.31 --> 2263.45
I'm suitable for that or people don't

2261.95 --> 2265.5499999999997
think I'm suitable for that because I

2263.45 --> 2268.3999999999996
get a steak I'd make things too

2265.55 --> 2273.0800000000004
complicated or too elaborate for a lot

2268.4 --> 2277.1600000000003
of people to follow but when it comes to

2273.08 --> 2280.46
the hardcore discussion like a an anchor

2277.16 --> 2283.58
point I will be that guy and there's

2280.46 --> 2285.7
gonna be like public humiliation [ __ ]

2283.58 --> 2288.86
gonna happen

2285.7 --> 2292.64
like basically expecting eventually even

2288.86 --> 2294.4700000000003
for supposed media related journalists

2292.64 --> 2297.5899999999997
or whatever to sneak out of up on me and

2294.47 --> 2301.5499999999997
like literally try to humiliate me very

2297.59 --> 2304.96
aggravatingly and then put that [ __ ] up

2301.55 --> 2304.96
on TV for real

2308.04 --> 2313.66
and I yeah there will be very little

2311.319 --> 2317.94
what I can do against it except be

2313.66 --> 2321.8799999999997
consistent and do not let my energy be

2317.94 --> 2323.829
altered by it and to just and it's kind

2321.88 --> 2325.54
of the same way that Mark sardian does

2323.829 --> 2327.94
it because mark sergeant knows he's

2325.54 --> 2329.829
getting attacked and the enemy is the

2327.94 --> 2331.869
enemy in the doing everything to try to

2329.829 --> 2337.2400000000002
change his energy and humiliate him and

2331.869 --> 2342.46
he is like super straight at it and that

2337.24 --> 2344.74
is just oh like that is that is like one

2342.46 --> 2346.599
of his prime qualities that I really

2344.74 --> 2348.4599999999996
respect about mark Sargent and that's

2346.599 --> 2350.9500000000003
like an example to me it's like oh my

2348.46 --> 2355.059
god dude yeah you have issues with

2350.95 --> 2358.839
things but that you can do that oh my

2355.059 --> 2361.2400000000002
god you can yep and so he will

2358.839 --> 2363.609
definitely also be a front-runner and

2361.24 --> 2366.72
he's gonna get the same as he's already

2363.609 --> 2366.72
getting these issues

2371.39 --> 2376.8799999999997
but he's still playing with it but I

2374.18 --> 2380.3599999999997
think it's gonna get worse especially

2376.88 --> 2384.26
once like the the new supposed moon

2380.36 --> 2386.57
landing [ __ ] starts happening with

2384.26 --> 2389.1800000000003
America that I think that's when like

2386.57 --> 2392.27
the media's gonna really start to bully

2389.18 --> 2399.2599999999998
flat-earthers like really start to bully

2392.27 --> 2402.07
them and not just ridicule them so

2399.26 --> 2402.07
prepare for that

2420.93 --> 2426.8089999999997
what

2423.549 --> 2430.99
I don't know I don't see how eat how

2426.809 --> 2435.549
either musk how QE and Nathan treated me

2430.99 --> 2442.4199999999996
yesterday was look I stand up for myself

2435.549 --> 2444.819
okay and there's something you need to

2442.42 --> 2448.059
know about what's going on there right

2444.819 --> 2452.47
so they are literally in a team and that

2448.059 --> 2454.63
team has a team spirit it's not just

2452.47 --> 2459.3289999999997
individuals that happen to this that

2454.63 --> 2461.92
happened to agree that team spirit is

2459.329 --> 2465.79
slightly politicized it's like a

2461.92 --> 2469.359
slightly politicized alliance that just

2465.79 --> 2471.549
make sure like this is the narrative

2469.359 --> 2475.5099999999998
based on what we figured out but there's

2471.549 --> 2478.69
no direct need to literally dig further

2475.51 --> 2482.0490000000004
among those aspects and that's an issue

2478.69 --> 2484.42
and I opposed that and I opposed that

2482.049 --> 2487.24
team spirit when it comes to our own

2484.42 --> 2489.52
assumptions I joined the team spirit

2487.24 --> 2493.2599999999998
when it comes to breaking down baller

2489.52 --> 2497.049
assumption [ __ ] and I do my best to

2493.26 --> 2498.73
refine whatever the group assumption is

2497.049 --> 2501.46
but there's not a lot of flexibility and

2498.73 --> 2505.72
this is mostly due to a quantum eraser

2501.46 --> 2508.0
and his assumptions and his trust in the

2505.72 --> 2514.39
body of science concerning quantum

2508.0 --> 2516.309
mechanics among other and certain

2514.39 --> 2519.0099999999998
aspects about the scientific method that

2516.309 --> 2520.5400000000004
I'd only partially agree with for me

2519.01 --> 2522.1600000000003
it's much more about the spirit of the

2520.54 --> 2526.299
scientific method but I'm willing to

2522.16 --> 2528.91
concede to that and I have that I say

2526.299 --> 2531.7599999999998
okay there is the scientific method

2528.91 --> 2533.589
which is almost unattainable it's not

2531.76 --> 2535.9
totally unattainable but for real

2533.589 --> 2538.089
serious complicated developments that's

2535.9 --> 2542.049
not going to work so everything else is

2538.089 --> 2546.339
basically going to be modeling deductive

2542.049 --> 2550.99
reasoning based tinkering with

2546.339 --> 2554.15
technology and I agreed to that and some

2550.99 --> 2558.22
people insist on calling it science

2554.15 --> 2563.6
I get that and I don't do that anymore

2558.22 --> 2565.8199999999997
I've adapted to that and whatever's yeah

2563.6 --> 2568.61
I think that it might actually serve a

2565.82 --> 2576.11
purpose really to me distinguish with

2568.61 --> 2581.42
that Betty came on the after show years

2576.11 --> 2589.9300000000003
ago I don't know I don't mind I don't

2581.42 --> 2592.4900000000002
know look I don't hate them look I deal

2589.93 --> 2595.1
relatively civilly with quantum eraser

2592.49 --> 2600.4399999999996
although I do really like to emphasize

2595.1 --> 2605.24
that he is kind of a dick at times I'd

2600.44 --> 2611.27
like to remind him like yeah you may

2605.24 --> 2614.5
have knowledge and you've really studied

2611.27 --> 2616.55
up on that knowledge as you've built it

2614.5 --> 2619.73
but that doesn't mean that you're

2616.55 --> 2621.8
perfect and that doesn't mean that that

2619.73 --> 2626.14
ends it that you have some kind of

2621.8 --> 2626.1400000000003
authority just because you did study

2626.74 --> 2631.7
because yeah there are still issues and

2629.6 --> 2633.5899999999997
that's just it and I'm satisfied with

2631.7 --> 2635.8399999999997
that and I'll let him do whatever he

2633.59 --> 2639.26
wants to do and hey if I get sick of his

2635.84 --> 2641.33
clown and this talks and all that [ __ ]

2639.26 --> 2643.2200000000003
now just say okay I'm not in for this

2641.33 --> 2645.79
and let's just leave and I have done so

2643.22 --> 2648.08
don't necessarily demonstrate

2645.79 --> 2652.4
demonstrably or how do you say with

2648.08 --> 2654.98
demonstration just like I'm not in for

2652.4 --> 2658.58
this I'll just hang around house days or

2654.98 --> 2659.39
something or do whatever watch the Alex

2658.58 --> 2665.11
Jones Show

2659.39 --> 2672.69
well usually that starts later so yeah

2665.11 --> 2675.4300000000003
but at the same time I do look

2672.69 --> 2677.43
the issue I have with quantum eraser I

2675.43 --> 2680.71
do not have with Nathan

2677.43 --> 2683.0099999999998
the only real there are only real issue

2680.71 --> 2686.579
and it's not even a real issue with

2683.01 --> 2696.059
Nathan that I do have is that he is very

2686.579 --> 2701.5
reliant upon a bone quantum eraser but

2696.059 --> 2703.809
he is not shamelessly so so even

2701.5 --> 2707.38
recently when I brought my cases forth

2703.809 --> 2710.049
I do got the hint from Nathan that at

2707.38 --> 2712.51
first he always would be very sarcastic

2710.049 --> 2714.7
when I would challenge something but he

2712.51 --> 2717.099
seems to be faker he seems to be getting

2714.7 --> 2721.21
a feel for what I'm saying and I think

2717.099 --> 2725.1400000000003
he may be getting starting to see the

2721.21 --> 2730.619
same picture so maybe he is now figuring

2725.14 --> 2733.89
out like weights quantum eraser might be

2730.619 --> 2736.359
made not even on purpose but might be

2733.89 --> 2740.98
actually kind of a gatekeeper in his own

2736.359 --> 2743.799
right not for nefarious reasons but just

2740.98 --> 2747.309
because that is what it turns out to

2743.799 --> 2750.7599999999998
become so I don't know I don't know

2747.309 --> 2752.44
we'll we'll all figure it out and I'm

2750.76 --> 2756.4300000000003
gonna be hearing a lot more clown

2752.44 --> 2759.01
accusations and all that and I just

2756.43 --> 2761.3799999999997
ignore it because he just over says it

2759.01 --> 2765.73
so much it completely loses its meaning

2761.38 --> 2768.9300000000003
it the guy is a total adult a total

2765.73 --> 2768.93
trope fast

2771.36 --> 2777.9300000000003
like yeah so it doesn't do anything you

2775.86 --> 2783.9300000000003
know the guy actually accuses everyone

2777.93 --> 2785.49
of it it's fine that's kind of funny

2783.93 --> 2790.02
though by the way that I'm starting to

2785.49 --> 2793.95
hear the term clown show in the

2790.02 --> 2796.68
alternative media a lot basically when

2793.95 --> 2805.31
describing literal or liberal situations

2796.68 --> 2808.5499999999997
and it's kind of funny yeah all right

2805.31 --> 2808.5499999999997
chocolate scene

2811.619 --> 2820.369
her keep calling John noisy pants yeah

2815.579 --> 2820.369
when he is noisy I will oh yeah

2825.05 --> 2828.719
[Music]

2836.089 --> 2839.0789999999997
okay

2844.28 --> 2849.3700000000003
ah anyway this

2868.95 --> 2876.87
uh yeah I am I don't know I think I've

2874.35 --> 2879.33
said almost everything I could say about

2876.87 --> 2886.89
the subject now but the situation with

2879.33 --> 2888.84
Patricia letters debates I yeah I could

2886.89 --> 2893.19
talk more about the trolls but I don't

2888.84 --> 2895.77
really want to still dealing with the

2893.19 --> 2897.36
backlash of yeah certain individuals

2895.77 --> 2901.05
that I thought were kind of good people

2897.36 --> 2907.59
that are just completely acting out

2901.05 --> 2910.02
starting to peach AFI and it just it's

2907.59 --> 2913.01
just so disappointing when you see that

2910.02 --> 2916.7
somebody completely loses control and

2913.01 --> 2916.7000000000003
don't stop themselves

2923.72 --> 2929.1899999999996
you know

2926.4 --> 2933.2000000000003
and I don't know how he how he's doing

2929.19 --> 2933.2000000000003
but it just it feels bad

2938.08 --> 2940.83
yeah

2950.88 --> 2961.7400000000002
clown is a reference to CIA ops huh is

2958.65 --> 2964.61
it that's interesting

2961.74 --> 2964.6099999999997
sort of

2966.95 --> 2972.49
can you elaborate on that Rasta

2988.43 --> 2994.24
don't sec what are you talking about

2991.64 --> 2994.24
Elon Musk

3000.54 --> 3010.92
what the Rasta saying yes is not an

3004.89 --> 3014.79
elaboration but it is look if that were

3010.92 --> 3018.92
the case that is kind of weird it is it

3014.79 --> 3018.92
would be kind of typical because if

3018.95 --> 3028.35
let's just presume for a moment that

3022.85 --> 3029.97
quantum eraser is like CIA and you know

3028.35 --> 3031.5899999999997
if that turned out to be a case I

3029.97 --> 3034.56
wouldn't even be surprised at this point

3031.59 --> 3040.59
but yeah there is just not relevant for

3034.56 --> 3043.34
now it would be very typical that he

3040.59 --> 3048.06
would indeed be calling everyone clowns

3043.34 --> 3049.8900000000003
it would fall right into the tactic that

3048.06 --> 3052.44
quantum eraser yesterday even confirmed

3049.89 --> 3055.5499999999997
like yeah Hillary Clinton perfected it

3052.44 --> 3058.91
doing something and then accusing your

3055.55 --> 3064.2000000000003
enemy of doing just that

3058.91 --> 3066.7799999999997
it's kind of funny but I don't know I

3064.2 --> 3070.8599999999997
don't know if this is the case with him

3066.78 --> 3073.5
I think that the problems are really

3070.86 --> 3080.81
more rounded in just his personality I

3073.5 --> 3085.38
don't I just if he really was like a a

3080.81 --> 3090.09
CIA dug-in agent then I think that he

3085.38 --> 3093.81
would have probably be a lot more

3090.09 --> 3097.4900000000002
aggressive and devious towards those

3093.81 --> 3100.77
that actually criticized him like me and

3097.49 --> 3104.04
he's just doing the same thing he always

3100.77 --> 3107.43
does I don't know it's he's not likely

3104.04 --> 3112.41
yeah he's not even being mean-spirited

3107.43 --> 3113.7
to me clown world look up clown world

3112.41 --> 3116.46
okay yeah

3113.7 --> 3118.4399999999996
Rasta are you saying that looking up

3116.46 --> 3125.9
clown world and Google is gonna explain

3118.44 --> 3128.4
it all are you like texting because I

3125.9 --> 3130.58
expected a lot more elaborate answer I

3128.4 --> 3130.58
know

3137.26 --> 3140.26
okay

3143.02 --> 3155.9
memes urban dictionary nope that didn't

3150.44 --> 3158.42
work try again maybe you could type it

3155.9 --> 3161.53
out in Skype or something

3158.42 --> 3161.53
[Music]

3190.27 --> 3199.69
huh chat is blocking my oh wait are you

3195.67 --> 3201.7000000000003
trying to put a link out yeah that only

3199.69 --> 3211.2400000000002
works if you have a wrench

3201.7 --> 3221.66
so Jesus Christ this couch guys keeps on

3211.24 --> 3224.8199999999997
going ok so just

3221.66 --> 3224.8199999999997
[Music]

3227.73 --> 3230.9
[Music]

3239.15 --> 3245.9
oh wait rust I think I know what you

3243.2 --> 3247.49
mean it is like a like it's not coming

3245.9 --> 3253.339
through yeah I've had that issued this

3247.49 --> 3254.99
morning this morning yesterday evening

3253.339 --> 3259.0389999999998
where that would happen you would type

3254.99 --> 3263.18
something and say like nope doesn't work

3259.039 --> 3265.9990000000003
try again I've had that yesterday so

3263.18 --> 3268.5389999999998
that may just be YouTube that's kind of

3265.999 --> 3268.5389999999998
acting weird

3280.11 --> 3287.65
now Devin good it's it's not an

3284.08 --> 3292.96
impression they actually lived together

3287.65 --> 3294.3
in England for a while for like half a

3292.96 --> 3297.25
year or a year

3294.3 --> 3300.52
Patricia moved in with Antonia soo

3297.25 --> 3302.74
barrettes so yeah that really happened

3300.52 --> 3309.67
that was they were on camera but the

3302.74 --> 3318.4799999999996
both of them and for a while it was good

3309.67 --> 3318.48
and then it just just clashed and just

3318.84 --> 3325.6000000000004
instead of just reaching together and

3321.76 --> 3328.3300000000004
really becoming good they and Tony just

3325.6 --> 3331.77
turned into a biggest egotistical

3328.33 --> 3338.77
monster even worse than before and

3331.77 --> 3342.22
Patricia I don't know she just yeah

3338.77 --> 3344.2599999999998
she's been trolled ever since because

3342.22 --> 3347.08
before that point it wasn't really that

3344.26 --> 3350.0200000000004
bad it was just the ballers after that

3347.08 --> 3353.71
point yeah they're the entire auntie

3350.02 --> 3359.14
Patricia troll movement meme basically

3353.71 --> 3361.8
started up so but they were together

3359.14 --> 3361.7999999999997
definitely

3371.869 --> 3377.9990000000003
aren't they no Rasta well I do have

3376.109 --> 3382.5589999999997
certain words blocked so that may be the

3377.999 --> 3389.0589999999997
issue you're having let me see what

3382.559 --> 3389.059
words are in the nono list right now

3419.8 --> 3431.77
all right I should probably remove some

3422.32 --> 3434.0800000000004
of this yeah I did that some time ago

3431.77 --> 3435.52
because they were like really trolling

3434.08 --> 3438.5099999999998
me with a couple of words it was

3435.52 --> 3438.5099999999998
extremely annoying

3439.44 --> 3450.94
so yeah reduce it back to the old four

3443.91 --> 3459.0299999999997
words I don't know what you were saying

3450.94 --> 3461.53
but that's right again anyway I am

3459.03 --> 3463.86
probably gonna round out the show pretty

3461.53 --> 3463.86
soon

3465.3 --> 3468.869
[Music]

3479.62 --> 3492.0699999999997
CIA really but that definitely was not

3487.94 --> 3499.9
in the blocked links rasta that is weird

3492.07 --> 3503.4700000000003
that is really odd maybe that's just

3499.9 --> 3503.4700000000003
your computer

3515.92 --> 3524.239
yeah maybe you should sweep your

3518.599 --> 3526.309
operating system and check for for a

3524.239 --> 3530.719
Trojan horse isn't that kind of [ __ ] I

3526.309 --> 3532.4
don't know anyway ah yeah I am gonna

3530.719 --> 3536.15
round out the show so thanks everyone

3532.4 --> 3538.369
for coming was a bit of a sad show I

3536.15 --> 3542.2000000000003
guess Patricia

3538.369 --> 3544.5190000000002
leaving like that and the issues that

3542.2 --> 3549.2
surrounded her and have surrounded her

3544.519 --> 3551.6899999999996
for four years needed to talk yeah I

3549.2 --> 3554.6299999999997
just wanted to talk about some of these

3551.69 --> 3558.7690000000002
details just quietly on my own because I

3554.63 --> 3562.279
have a lot to say about them and just to

3558.769 --> 3565.4599999999996
make things clear about who she kind of

3562.279 --> 3571.16
was as far as I know it how I regarded

3565.46 --> 3573.619
her and just this insane behavior from a

3571.16 --> 3577.3089999999997
lot of people it's almost like a curse

3573.619 --> 3584.15
and they just go maniacal and get

3577.309 --> 3585.71
obsessed and it's it's aggravating that

3584.15 --> 3590.2690000000002
that there are so many flat-earthers

3585.71 --> 3593.839
that are susceptible to this form of

3590.269 --> 3598.3999999999996
group insanity that they're not more

3593.839 --> 3601.339
reserved and more careful so yeah it is

3598.4 --> 3603.92
what it is anyway thanks everyone for

3601.339 --> 3607.069
