whether today is next

114.96 --> 118.79899999999999
it's actually quite beautiful right now

119.28 --> 125.759
nice blue skies very clear blue

122.479 --> 129.36
see but also

125.759 --> 133.2
cloud banks in the distance

129.36 --> 133.20000000000002
and some fluffy clouds over here

133.76 --> 143.84
and still the sun yeah when the sun's

135.52 --> 143.84
coming through it's quite nice

144.239 --> 147.04
very calm

147.28 --> 151.12
doesn't seem to be a lot of wind going

154.84 --> 159.04
out

156.64 --> 159.04
all right

161.519 --> 163.84
so

164.959 --> 172.16
it's sunday the 2nd of

168.84 --> 174.16
may 2021

172.16 --> 176.16
yeah i watched back my whole show from

174.16 --> 179.2
yesterday and it was really

176.16 --> 182.48
kind of silly that i said first of april

179.2 --> 185.28
when it was the first of may i

182.48 --> 186.64
totally didn't notice that kind of silly

185.28 --> 190.8
anyway

186.64 --> 194.39999999999998
hello terret 306 first in chat

190.8 --> 194.4
agm good to see you

195.68 --> 202.56
you did night owl when 2020 ended

200.159 --> 202.56
did i

205.519 --> 211.36
i don't think so i think like my last

208.64 --> 214.48
night i was like in 2019

211.36 --> 214.48000000000002
but i'm actually gonna

214.959 --> 218.4
check out my playlist

221.92 --> 227.83999999999997
oh wait

230.239 --> 234.08
17 1

235.4 --> 243.12
21 right now it wasn't it was

239.36 --> 243.12
right when 2020 started

247.92 --> 250.55999999999997
so it's been

251.84 --> 257.84000000000003
yeah more than a year ago it wasn't at

255.12 --> 261.74
the end of 2020

257.84 --> 264.15999999999997
somewhere to start in january anyway

261.74 --> 266.32
[Music]

264.16 --> 268.32000000000005
you corrected me in chat there were 306

266.32 --> 269.04
oh i didn't pick up on that when it

268.32 --> 272.08
happened

269.04 --> 275.36
but yeah i don't know sometimes i made

272.08 --> 276.32
just in my mind it switches it's i don't

275.36 --> 278.88
see it

276.32 --> 278.88
it's weird

280.16 --> 285.759
anyway hello nathan oakley 1980 good to

282.96 --> 285.75899999999996
see you in chat

287.36 --> 290.24
amanda young

294.479 --> 302.15999999999997
right so

297.52 --> 306.639
yeah yesterday night pretty late

302.16 --> 306.639
the night i'll show number five and

307.44 --> 314.4
lasted over two and a half hours

311.28 --> 319.039
it was it was good and it was different

314.4 --> 322.71999999999997
also because to be fair i was

319.039 --> 323.68
like pretty tired i am like not as

322.72 --> 326.32000000000005
active as i

323.68 --> 328.08
can be in the morning and in the

326.32 --> 331.919
afternoon

328.08 --> 331.919
and i had already had kind of a

332.32 --> 337.199
bit of a tired day i guess because it

334.639 --> 339.52
was such a late night the night before

337.199 --> 340.24
but still like i just felt like i have

339.52 --> 342.96
to do this

340.24 --> 343.84000000000003
and it was great because the guys that i

342.96 --> 346.96
got on the panel

343.84 --> 349.67999999999995
they they they didn't need

346.96 --> 351.59999999999997
really much guidance they were just they

349.68 --> 352.56
were just going on and on and on and it

351.6 --> 355.28000000000003
was like whoa

352.56 --> 356.0
that i really don't even have to

355.28 --> 360.23999999999995
interject

356.0 --> 362.56
anything like sometimes maybe

360.24 --> 364.88
but i had full time to basically check

362.56 --> 370.4
out the chat

364.88 --> 370.4
and also get after sean hawkins

370.72 --> 376.96000000000004
why copyright strike struck

373.759 --> 379.199
but it seems like there's a

376.96 --> 380.23999999999995
some delay they have had the due

379.199 --> 383.28000000000003
moderation team

380.24 --> 386.479
has some hesitation for some reason

383.28 --> 388.96
so they sent me an email and i responded

386.479 --> 391.84
to that back

388.96 --> 394.15999999999997
and i wonder if they're gonna go for it

391.84 --> 396.31899999999996
but it's

394.16 --> 396.319
just

397.6 --> 404.56
right he was literally live streaming my

401.199 --> 407.28000000000003
live stream and i don't know

404.56 --> 408.72
when other people do that usually they

407.28 --> 412.15999999999997
just get

408.72 --> 412.16
struck really quickly

413.84 --> 416.96
and in this case i reported it as it was

416.08 --> 420.96
still going

416.96 --> 425.039
pretty early on and it's still not down

420.96 --> 427.52
so that's what's going on here youtube

425.039 --> 429.759
i'm pretty sure that all of my videos on

427.52 --> 432.639
youtube since the very start

429.759 --> 435.44
i uniformly set them to like no this is

432.639 --> 439.919
definitely like

435.44 --> 439.919
my youtube content so

440.88 --> 443.039
just

444.8 --> 448.72
right they're supposed to guarding guard

447.12 --> 451.199
my copyrights

448.72 --> 451.759
and if other people can just pirate my

451.199 --> 455.199
stream

451.759 --> 455.199
life without my permission

455.44 --> 464.08
that like do i have any copyrights then

461.039 --> 467.199
is youtube just deciding that anybody

464.08 --> 468.31899999999996
whoever likes it can just pirate stream

467.199 --> 471.84000000000003
whatever i do

468.319 --> 475.91900000000004
instantly as i'm live streaming

471.84 --> 477.84
seems odd but anyway

475.919 --> 480.4
they're taking their time and we'll see

477.84 --> 480.4
what happens

481.039 --> 484.15999999999997
my show was lit

484.479 --> 487.84
well yeah i definitely i i guess i'd

486.72 --> 490.0
have to say that

487.84 --> 492.23999999999995
because sean hawkins did it i did get

490.0 --> 494.24
like extra baller attention i definitely

492.24 --> 495.68
did get more eyes on me

494.24 --> 498.40000000000003
and i guess a whole bunch of ballers

495.68 --> 500.96
were also kind of curious to see

498.4 --> 501.44
like what the guys and especially brian

500.96 --> 504.31899999999996
would

501.44 --> 508.0
actually explain and they got full room

504.319 --> 510.8
to do it nobody rumpusing them

508.0 --> 511.199
i love that i also all of the guys like

510.8 --> 513.919
not

511.199 --> 514.5600000000001
nobody rumpus each other either it was

513.919 --> 518.88
really

514.56 --> 518.88
great it was just very concentrated

519.44 --> 523.9190000000001
focus and in the end it was funny

522.159 --> 525.6
because it kind of like got into the

523.919 --> 528.959
curiosity of what you see

525.6 --> 532.399
when you go into google earth right

528.959 --> 533.3599999999999
kind of stuck around for like another

532.399 --> 535.6
half hour

533.36 --> 537.519
but yeah it was i thought it was a great

535.6 --> 540.32
show great hangout

537.519 --> 540.32
a lot of data

543.76 --> 551.12
a lot of detail

549.36 --> 552.72
and i'm glad all of you appreciate it

551.12 --> 556.8
and we're present there in chat

552.72 --> 558.64
to support it including nathan oakley

556.8 --> 561.3599999999999
who's going at it against a couple of

558.64 --> 565.76
ballers here and there

561.36 --> 568.24
right yeah joseph 369

565.76 --> 570.64
google earth is flat or it's locally

568.24 --> 570.64
flat

572.48 --> 575.6
they they do try to kind of like it

574.88 --> 578.16
seemed

575.6 --> 580.72
and that's what we rounded the show out

578.16 --> 583.8389999999999
with the night i'll show yesterday

580.72 --> 586.32
that it seems that they do kind of

583.839 --> 590.5600000000001
flatten things out in order to make it

586.32 --> 593.2
kind of look like what you would see at

590.56 --> 593.1999999999999
ground level

593.519 --> 597.36
and then beyond it they they try to

595.839 --> 600.0
curve it away

597.36 --> 600.0
but it yeah

601.76 --> 607.8389999999999
effectively it's flat the map is flat

605.519 --> 610.8
it's just being bent into a ball

607.839 --> 610.8000000000001
when you zoom out

616.8 --> 623.68
oh yeah tara 306

620.32 --> 627.519
he is just attention seeking

623.68 --> 629.12
you know and in a way if if he wants to

627.519 --> 630.72
review what i do

629.12 --> 632.8
he wouldn't be the first right there's

630.72 --> 636.0790000000001
plenty of people that take my shows and

632.8 --> 636.079
then go and review it it's

636.959 --> 641.5999999999999
it's not really worth my attention but i

639.2 --> 642.72
i i guess i don't have a problem with

641.6 --> 645.279
that

642.72 --> 646.24
but if somebody's just gonna pirate live

645.279 --> 648.959
stream it

646.24 --> 651.92
how is that commentary it's live you

648.959 --> 653.68
don't know what i'm gonna say

651.92 --> 655.4399999999999
right you don't know what's gonna happen

653.68 --> 659.1999999999999
it's life

655.44 --> 662.32
right how is that how could you then

659.2 --> 664.399
categorize it as commentary

662.32 --> 666.0
it's live you don't know what's going to

664.399 --> 670.16
be said

666.0 --> 670.16
i don't know maybe i'm getting it wrong

673.76 --> 676.24
anyway

681.68 --> 686.64
those guys think orthographic includes

686.839 --> 693.36
perspective

688.72 --> 693.36
well i wonder though like include

696.64 --> 701.4399999999999
when you do the line drawing on

698.48 --> 704.0
autographic view

701.44 --> 706.0790000000001
it does emulate perspective what it

704.0 --> 709.44
doesn't do however

706.079 --> 712.6389999999999
is help

709.44 --> 716.24
is adjust for other

712.639 --> 718.72
optics right for atmospherics

716.24 --> 720.5600000000001
like in an autographic view is there

718.72 --> 726.32
like oh let's zone it out this

720.56 --> 729.4399999999999
is 0.0035

726.32 --> 729.9200000000001
refraction zone and this is a different

729.44 --> 732.8800000000001
one

729.92 --> 733.519
like oh really no no that's not really

732.88 --> 735.76
applied

733.519 --> 736.639
when you go into arthrographic geometry

735.76 --> 738.56
view

736.639 --> 740.16
right it can sort of apply for

738.56 --> 743.279
perspective

740.16 --> 746.959
you draw the lines but in reality

743.279 --> 749.36
that never really pans out even with

746.959 --> 751.1999999999999
pretty basic setups and that was

749.36 --> 752.639
demonstrated to me i was able to bring

751.2 --> 754.5600000000001
that up during the night i'll show

752.639 --> 758.0790000000001
somewhere in the middle

754.56 --> 760.88
we i remember through nathan oakley

758.079 --> 762.88
what is it a year ago two years ago yeah

760.88 --> 766.399
probably two years ago

762.88 --> 768.32
videos came by of how a setup or a camp

766.399 --> 770.32
where a camera would be placed now

768.32 --> 771.6800000000001
basically looking from the side view

770.32 --> 772.5600000000001
camera would be placed there was an

771.68 --> 774.4799999999999
obstacle

772.56 --> 776.079
and there was another obstacle and then

774.48 --> 776.48
from the side view you could literally

776.079 --> 779.68
draw

776.48 --> 783.2
draw a straight line but then

779.68 --> 786.2399999999999
in the actual view it turns out

783.2 --> 789.6
like the four the thing in the middle

786.24 --> 793.279
seemed to actually tower over

789.6 --> 794.24
the object so it didn't geometrically

793.279 --> 797.519
line up right

794.24 --> 800.8
even though that was all pretty close by

797.519 --> 804.32
and confirmed all flat the heights

800.8 --> 807.4399999999999
the literal line was drawn

804.32 --> 807.9200000000001
like with a little rope or something and

807.44 --> 811.36
so

807.92 --> 814.079
it just turns out that optics

811.36 --> 815.36
whatever you're going to consider causes

814.079 --> 818.56
that

815.36 --> 819.92
in a real view it doesn't line up like

818.56 --> 822.399
geometry

819.92 --> 824.639
like like it does like it can in

822.399 --> 827.6
orthographic view and that's the issue

824.639 --> 829.519
is it's not sufficient for whatever

827.6 --> 832.88
causes the alteration in

829.519 --> 835.12
actual view can be debated and it's very

832.88 --> 838.32
confusing

835.12 --> 839.12
but what can be said is it doesn't line

838.32 --> 842.32
up like that

839.12 --> 844.399
in actual view and therefore the

842.32 --> 847.0400000000001
comparison and then saying oh

844.399 --> 848.16
look it doesn't match the geometry so

847.04 --> 850.56
the geometry

848.16 --> 852.3199999999999
presupposition is wrong that's just

850.56 --> 857.8389999999999
wrong

852.32 --> 857.839
it's been empirically proven to be wrong

858.079 --> 861.92
and that was like two years ago i don't

859.92 --> 871.8389999999999
know if nathan remembers all this

861.92 --> 871.8389999999999
he was there

872.639 --> 876.72
hello my eyes by the way good to see you

881.76 --> 899.8389999999999
oh hello cameron kamikaze gilmore thanks

884.32 --> 899.839
for the paypal this night

914.8 --> 922.24
yeah now i'm going with nathan also

919.12 --> 924.5600000000001
like he is playing

922.24 --> 926.0790000000001
ranty i think he is kind of playing the

924.56 --> 929.8389999999999
globers but he's also

926.079 --> 933.279
playing himself and

929.839 --> 936.8000000000001
yeah i predict that

933.279 --> 940.72
he will basically lose his faculties

936.8 --> 944.7199999999999
because of that

940.72 --> 948.639
because he's not he's letting the

944.72 --> 950.88
the flame of inside flicker for himself

948.639 --> 951.6800000000001
with what he's doing he's gaslighting

950.88 --> 955.04
himself that

951.68 --> 957.519
yeah that's the whole new terminology

955.04 --> 958.24
i'm yeah i've brought it up a while ago

957.519 --> 961.759
but i think

958.24 --> 962.8
it is very to the point in current

961.759 --> 964.88
events

962.8 --> 966.56
people gaslighting themselves and when

964.88 --> 968.399
you do that and you start to believe

966.56 --> 972.2399999999999
your own gas lighting

968.399 --> 975.759
then you will get the cognitive

972.24 --> 977.839
dissonance and the price

975.759 --> 980.16
you lose knowledge the thing that

977.839 --> 983.1990000000001
counters the thing

980.16 --> 984.8
you're trying to forget and gaslight

983.199 --> 996.959
yourself with

984.8 --> 998.88
you will lose that grip

996.959 --> 1000.6389999999999
it's like self-induced cognitive

998.88 --> 1010.72
dissonance in a way it's

1000.639 --> 1013.199
yeah i don't recommend it hello matthew

1010.72 --> 1013.1990000000001
eastman

1016.959 --> 1025.839
he sounded so embarrassed when he said

1018.88 --> 1025.839
the ground was obscured by curvature

1033.839 --> 1039.36
all right yep good point but why was he

1036.64 --> 1042.64
embarrassed was he embarrassed

1039.36 --> 1044.8799999999999
for himself or was he embarrassed upon

1042.64 --> 1047.439
the realization that the people that are

1044.88 --> 1050.8400000000001
following him and the globers

1047.439 --> 1053.8400000000001
will actually believe that and not even

1050.84 --> 1053.84
notice

1064.84 --> 1067.84
right

1077.039 --> 1081.84
okay joseph369 didn't he do that

1082.16 --> 1088.559
didn't ranty go on brandon's like

1085.44 --> 1088.559
somewhere in last week

1091.679 --> 1094.799
and actually say like no i think it's a

1093.919 --> 1097.8400000000001
globe i

1094.799 --> 1098.72
remember having seen or heard a snippet

1097.84 --> 1101.52
of it

1098.72 --> 1102.48
didn't watch the whole thing and when

1101.52 --> 1105.52
was that like

1102.48 --> 1105.52
wednesday or something

1105.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
i don't know

1134.84 --> 1142.48
anyway yeah it was uh

1137.84 --> 1144.8799999999999
nice having a nighttime event

1142.48 --> 1144.88
again

1146.799 --> 1152.6399999999999
and yeah depending on circumstances

1150.32 --> 1154.3999999999999
i might do it again i don't know how

1152.64 --> 1156.16
quickly it's not something that i'm like

1154.4 --> 1157.52
gonna do every weekend or something like

1156.16 --> 1161.44
that but

1157.52 --> 1162.799
if the call comes i i will provide the

1161.44 --> 1166.16
platform also there was a

1162.799 --> 1168.48
this was a great test for

1166.16 --> 1170.16
yeah the the update on the sound system

1168.48 --> 1172.08
that adam me can help me with

1170.16 --> 1173.76
with skype and i think it worked out

1172.08 --> 1175.6
just fine

1173.76 --> 1177.52
i did have a little issue though that i

1175.6 --> 1179.84
couldn't

1177.52 --> 1181.9189999999999
i did didn't realize that i realized

1179.84 --> 1184.1599999999999
that afterward that when

1181.919 --> 1186.88
i during the live stream even though i

1184.16 --> 1189.1200000000001
had my own mic on mute

1186.88 --> 1190.96
that when i go to another one another

1189.12 --> 1192.9599999999998
person's video play it

1190.96 --> 1195.2
like that sound did come through i

1192.96 --> 1197.679
didn't even realize that until somebody

1195.2 --> 1197.679
told me

1199.36 --> 1207.4399999999998
so yeah i gotta be careful with that

1204.84 --> 1209.4399999999998
unfortunately i cannot play

1207.44 --> 1212.159
any other videos without the sound

1209.44 --> 1212.159
leaking through

1212.559 --> 1217.12
in that setup so remember that for next

1218.84 --> 1221.84
time

1231.039 --> 1235.84
hello bollock pineapple

1246.84 --> 1252.32
okay

1248.24 --> 1252.32
i agree it's not like randy kept it a

1260.84 --> 1263.84
secret

1264.72 --> 1272.0
so anyway any reflections or ideas

1268.96 --> 1276.88
or comments about

1272.0 --> 1280.64
yesterday's night owl show

1276.88 --> 1280.64
for those that hadn't seen it live

1281.36 --> 1285.039
explain what emmanuel uh

1285.84 --> 1291.84
why he thinks the earth is a ball now

1294.88 --> 1298.48
what proof of the ball that runty found

1297.28 --> 1301.12
uh

1298.48 --> 1302.84
well the picture the picture question

1301.12 --> 1305.84
the the blackpool swan

1302.84 --> 1305.84
picture

1307.039 --> 1310.08
that was what the whole situation

1308.96 --> 1312.48
between

1310.08 --> 1313.6
brian and randy was all about and what

1312.48 --> 1318.159
yeah

1313.6 --> 1322.1589999999999
right and the fed crowd

1318.159 --> 1322.159
we're talking about on my show yesterday

1327.52 --> 1337.36
right but it's not real proof

1332.64 --> 1341.679
it's just him mocking up

1337.36 --> 1343.76
to try and re-engage in the ball belief

1341.679 --> 1345.919
that's kind of like what he's doing

1343.76 --> 1347.679
effectively now whether he completely

1345.919 --> 1351.2
believes in that or he's trying to

1347.679 --> 1352.4
trick everybody potentially including

1351.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
himself

1352.4 --> 1361.8400000000001
it's hard to tell

1364.4 --> 1368.159
was randy a baller at first

1371.2 --> 1376.64
yeah i remember

1374.24 --> 1377.679
him from the old days when he was still

1376.64 --> 1380.96
very close with

1377.679 --> 1380.96
with sleeping warrior

1381.52 --> 1389.12
he has done live shows

1384.88 --> 1391.6000000000001
where he did actually explain how he

1389.12 --> 1392.8799999999999
became a flat earther how that started

1391.6 --> 1395.6
to work

1392.88 --> 1402.5590000000002
so yeah he he has definitely talked

1395.6 --> 1404.559
about that

1402.559 --> 1406.3999999999999
maybe randy is just getting an audience

1404.559 --> 1408.1589999999999
by flip-flopping right well that might

1406.4 --> 1412.4
be what he's doing it for

1408.159 --> 1417.0390000000002
right but it's very reckless

1412.4 --> 1420.96
it's a reckless strategy

1417.039 --> 1420.96
basically shooting himself in the foot

1421.039 --> 1431.84
like jose yeah like jose

1431.919 --> 1436.159
keep getting ranty and rumpus mixed up

1437.279 --> 1440.48
now randy's not as

1441.44 --> 1445.8400000000001
not as zealous as rumpus

1446.52 --> 1449.71
[Music]

1456.24 --> 1460.4
am i going to become a globe or too

1460.88 --> 1463.7600000000002
that's hilarious

1464.96 --> 1468.6000000000001
well i have a side of me that is still a

1467.52 --> 1472.0
glober

1468.6 --> 1474.48
compartmentalized based

1472.0 --> 1475.919
on my experiences in the past so i can

1474.48 --> 1479.1200000000001
kind of summon

1475.919 --> 1479.1200000000001
my inner glober

1479.6 --> 1484.559
right but

1482.96 --> 1486.0
that doesn't mean that i'm going to

1484.559 --> 1488.3999999999999
become him i

1486.0 --> 1490.96
kind of outgrew him that's why he's from

1488.4 --> 1490.96
the past

1491.039 --> 1496.32
so why would i do that i'm a cosmogenist

1493.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
there's so much

1496.32 --> 1501.84
to explore

1501.919 --> 1506.159
why would i get back to the ball that's

1503.6 --> 1506.1589999999999
just silly

1508.48 --> 1514.88
i mean sure i'll probably keep

1512.48 --> 1517.039
getting yeah ideas concerning the

1514.88 --> 1520.3200000000002
heliocentric model and just

1517.039 --> 1522.4
add commentary or design tips right

1520.32 --> 1526.3999999999999
that's not even ironic

1522.4 --> 1528.64
but like truly become a glober and then

1526.4 --> 1532.64
start ridiculing flat earthers

1528.64 --> 1535.1200000000001
never it's preposterous

1532.64 --> 1535.8400000000001
although i will criticize flat earthers

1535.12 --> 1540.08
for their

1535.84 --> 1543.12
incorrect explanations or understanding

1540.08 --> 1546.32
or for their bad behavior

1543.12 --> 1549.9189999999999
if they haven't any but

1546.32 --> 1552.48
yeah that's that's not because they're

1549.919 --> 1557.8400000000001
flat earthers that's just because i

1552.48 --> 1557.84
i feel i need to do that because i can

1563.039 --> 1571.84
so no never going to become a glober

1579.6 --> 1583.76
i think that the best you could ever get

1581.52 --> 1585.12
out of me is that at some point i might

1583.76 --> 1587.679
choose to kind of play

1585.12 --> 1591.039
characters or something though i've

1587.679 --> 1594.159
really rigidly avoided doing that

1591.039 --> 1597.52
i keep it to like very short acts

1594.159 --> 1600.5590000000002
where i get a little silly and play out

1597.52 --> 1603.84
goblin whatever

1600.559 --> 1604.24
but yeah i might at some point like get

1603.84 --> 1607.279
like

1604.24 --> 1610.24
professor global globe win or something

1607.279 --> 1614.32
and then put on a white lab coat

1610.24 --> 1617.919
and then kind of like try to reenact

1614.32 --> 1619.84
a glober and might even get some kind of

1617.919 --> 1620.5590000000002
consistency at it it would pretty much

1619.84 --> 1624.72
be

1620.559 --> 1626.72
like as if my old globe herself

1624.72 --> 1629.039
would have actually gone for it and then

1626.72 --> 1631.3600000000001
chose to be yeah

1629.039 --> 1633.36
become like a professor of the globe

1631.36 --> 1636.6399999999999
right that's what i would

1633.36 --> 1637.1999999999998
develop that into but it's always going

1636.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
to be an

1637.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
act right

1642.32 --> 1645.76
yeah it's just like when for example

1644.48 --> 1650.24
alex jones does

1645.76 --> 1652.96
his act of of globalists

1650.24 --> 1654.32
when he starts to act like the british

1652.96 --> 1658.08
royalty

1654.32 --> 1661.279
voice or any of the other types

1658.08 --> 1663.6789999999999
you know like yeah he acts like that

1661.279 --> 1664.32
because he does get into it he does like

1663.679 --> 1667.2
get it

1664.32 --> 1668.0
it haunts him in a way but that's not

1667.2 --> 1671.8400000000001
really him

1668.0 --> 1675.36
he's obviously it's an act

1671.84 --> 1682.08
and so being a glober for me

1675.36 --> 1685.52
will always be an act

1682.08 --> 1687.279
and i will hopefully keep that plenty

1685.52 --> 1697.84
obvious

1687.279 --> 1697.84
if needed with disclaimers

1699.12 --> 1703.12
like what the following video you're

1700.96 --> 1706.159
about to see

1703.12 --> 1709.12
is arwen acting like a globe or he's not

1706.159 --> 1725.8400000000001
actually a glow or don't worry

1709.12 --> 1725.84
right in that direction

1749.039 --> 1753.84
you can't unsee the truth

1756.0 --> 1758.24
well

1764.08 --> 1768.799
you can but once you let it really shine

1768.159 --> 1772.7990000000002
through and

1768.799 --> 1775.12
you adapt to the insights

1772.799 --> 1777.84
to what you figure out this is real this

1775.12 --> 1780.399
is existential

1777.84 --> 1782.08
then once you adapt because people can

1780.399 --> 1784.0
be faced with the truth if they've

1782.08 --> 1785.52
shielded themselves against it and

1784.0 --> 1787.44
they'll never let it through it'll

1785.52 --> 1789.44
always bounce off

1787.44 --> 1790.799
they will get into a lot of cognitive

1789.44 --> 1792.0800000000002
pain because of it

1790.799 --> 1794.799
because they're constantly confronted

1792.08 --> 1795.279
with something that is like the devil to

1794.799 --> 1797.52
them

1795.279 --> 1799.36
like something they cannot let in even

1797.52 --> 1802.559
though they don't understand

1799.36 --> 1805.84
but once you actually start to

1802.559 --> 1808.96
adapt to the truth

1805.84 --> 1811.039
to information then

1808.96 --> 1812.799
eventually you can't unsee it anymore

1811.039 --> 1814.799
because your entire structure your

1812.799 --> 1816.399
entire way of doing things and feeling

1814.799 --> 1820.0
things out

1816.399 --> 1823.84
is adapted to it and then after that

1820.0 --> 1823.84
point you can only act

1824.88 --> 1828.64
with all the consequences of that

1832.64 --> 1840.24
just eat steak blissfully what

1837.279 --> 1842.88
it's been a while since i had steak like

1840.24 --> 1842.88
quite a while

1844.159 --> 1851.8400000000001
that is so expensive man

1860.24 --> 1867.6
hmm and c is not even a word

1864.08 --> 1869.36
yet you're using it and i don't think

1867.6 --> 1872.8799999999999
anybody's asking in chat

1869.36 --> 1874.08
what does unc mean no people definitely

1872.88 --> 1876.3990000000001
know what that means

1874.08 --> 1877.6789999999999
so even though it's maybe not officially

1876.399 --> 1880.4799999999998
a word

1877.679 --> 1880.48
it is a word

1884.399 --> 1889.84
right and c is basically a form of

1887.2 --> 1907.8400000000001
forgetting

1889.84 --> 1907.84
hey sleeping warrior good to see you

1911.05 --> 1914.19

right yeah also neil by the way you

1999.36 --> 2003.1999999999998
started singing like the

2000.96 --> 2006.559
the black pool swan song and all that

2003.2 --> 2010.72
and expected me to go up high

2006.559 --> 2010.72
it was like two o'clock at night here

2011.919 --> 2019.8400000000001
so i was trying to keep things as silent

2014.24 --> 2019.84
as i could

2024.88 --> 2030.64
because i know that my voice carries

2026.96 --> 2030.64
much further than what comes out of the

2030.84 --> 2033.84
speakers

2043.92 --> 2047.039
[Music]

2047.44 --> 2051.919
yeah iron 26 i know

2055.359 --> 2063.119
it's it's kind of weird now

2059.599 --> 2066.2400000000002
remembering back how i got

2063.119 --> 2068.48
kind of radical with my statements it's

2066.24 --> 2071.399
just called like the medical system like

2068.48 --> 2072.639
it's not doctors anymore they're

2071.399 --> 2075.04
necromancers

2072.639 --> 2077.2000000000003
and now to see basically what's going on

2075.04 --> 2081.2799999999997
out there

2077.2 --> 2085.04
like i wasn't even like overshooting

2081.28 --> 2087.28
i wasn't even overblowing things

2085.04 --> 2088.879
it's just that as i was saying it i knew

2087.28 --> 2092.0
like yeah this is going to sound

2088.879 --> 2092.0
really dramatic

2095.2 --> 2098.0
but it's true

2098.32 --> 2103.839
yeah vaccine shedding oh god

2104.4 --> 2110.32
it's side effects it's like whatever

2107.599 --> 2110.32
it's going to do

2110.4 --> 2114.1600000000003
what's going to be produced in the body

2112.079 --> 2118.4
because of what it does

2114.16 --> 2121.5989999999997
has influences on other people

2118.4 --> 2122.7200000000003
so that's around them and there's

2121.599 --> 2126.7200000000003
already been

2122.72 --> 2126.72
multiple signs that that's going on

2127.92 --> 2132.8
no that's not fear-mongering ralph

2142.839 --> 2145.839
rodriguez

2160.96 --> 2166.4
that's what happened to randy what

2164.32 --> 2168.0
what the hell has randy got to do with

2166.4 --> 2173.839
that

2168.0 --> 2173.839
what do you mean neil

2177.92 --> 2184.48
oh wait shed into a baller no

2181.599 --> 2186.56
i don't think there's a ball or vaccine

2184.48 --> 2188.079
that turns you into a baller and then it

2186.56 --> 2191.52
sheds on other people i

2188.079 --> 2194.5600000000004
don't let's not even be

2191.52 --> 2196.96
think about that okay neil that's such a

2194.56 --> 2201.68
terrible idea that there's literally a

2196.96 --> 2204.4
mind programming vaccine or something

2201.68 --> 2204.7999999999997
let's just ensure that the necromancers

2204.4 --> 2206.8
get

2204.8 --> 2208.5600000000004
taken care of before we get to that

2206.8 --> 2212.1600000000003
point thank you very much

2208.56 --> 2216.7999999999997
and don't forget to destroy all their

2212.16 --> 2218.64
medical experimentation atrocities

2216.8 --> 2221.52
very important not to leave all that

2218.64 --> 2221.52
garbage around

2225.28 --> 2229.8390000000004
scroll up

2233.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
scroll up to what

2246.88 --> 2257.839
do you think he got the vaccine neil

2250.8 --> 2257.8390000000004
could be man could be

2258.72 --> 2263.5989999999997
yeah barney rubble facts to make you a

2261.04 --> 2263.599
glober

2263.92 --> 2271.839
i hope it's always going to stay a joke

2285.04 --> 2299.839
yeah yeah i remember neil castino yeah

2288.079 --> 2299.8390000000004
infecto and all that garbage i remember

2353.92 --> 2357.44
rent is a scared little like that i

2356.72 --> 2361.1189999999997
don't know

2357.44 --> 2362.56
it just seems to not be very wise in his

2361.119 --> 2365.6800000000003
judgments about

2362.56 --> 2365.68
how things really work

2366.56 --> 2371.599
like he has the capability of doing a

2368.96 --> 2374.48
lot of things

2371.599 --> 2376.0
like he has some talent but it seems

2374.48 --> 2382.72
like the wisdom

2376.0 --> 2384.48
is the problem like

2382.72 --> 2386.48
i don't know if he really even

2384.48 --> 2387.52
understands the long-term struggle

2386.48 --> 2390.88
that's happening

2387.52 --> 2394.079
like the awakening i think that ranty

2390.88 --> 2397.6800000000003
basically doesn't believe

2394.079 --> 2399.8390000000004
the awakening i perhaps

2397.68 --> 2401.7599999999998
getting a glimpse of how incredibly

2399.839 --> 2404.0
stupid people are out there

2401.76 --> 2407.119
which is what happens eventually it's

2404.0 --> 2407.119
just inevitable

2407.76 --> 2413.5200000000004
didn't lead him to basically become a

2411.52 --> 2425.839
separated champion no he rather

2413.52 --> 2425.839
he just wants to play with it

2433.0 --> 2436.21
[Music]

2439.44 --> 2444.2400000000002
all right maybe he believes in like the

2441.72 --> 2447.2
compartmentalized society the facts of

2444.24 --> 2449.359
the vectors and the non-vectors it's

2447.2 --> 2452.64
already kind of being played upon

2449.359 --> 2454.96
from top down it's weird maybe he wants

2452.64 --> 2457.359
to be on the vaccinated side then

2454.96 --> 2458.16
if he even did that i'm not saying that

2457.359 --> 2462.0789999999997
he did

2458.16 --> 2464.0789999999997
it was you that kind of suggested that

2462.079 --> 2466.079
but maybe he wants to be on that side

2464.079 --> 2470.319
because he thinks he can get a better

2466.079 --> 2473.76
grasp on them all you'll get

2470.319 --> 2473.7599999999998
right he won't just be

2473.92 --> 2480.0
ranty dubious guy

2477.119 --> 2481.52
no he'll be the capable guy that has

2480.0 --> 2484.48
more grasp on things

2481.52 --> 2485.839
compared to most that are going to be

2484.48 --> 2488.2400000000002
taking that

2485.839 --> 2490.0789999999997
people that are very naive and don't

2488.24 --> 2492.64
look into things

2490.079 --> 2493.76
so maybe it's just like a and

2492.64 --> 2497.04
strategical

2493.76 --> 2499.119
area reason like the field of influence

2497.04 --> 2500.4
he wants to have is maybe on that side

2499.119 --> 2503.2000000000003
and that's why he did that

2500.4 --> 2506.64
just completely not grasping the full

2503.2 --> 2506.64
consequences of all of it

2507.52 --> 2511.28
i don't know if he's actually scared of

2509.76 --> 2514.7200000000003
kovit i think he knows

2511.28 --> 2514.7200000000003
it's complete [ __ ]

2516.319 --> 2523.839
he just wants to play the game

2532.88 --> 2537.839
all right i agree neil

2551.04 --> 2556.8
yeah that's correct ralph i suspect

2553.44 --> 2556.8
that's how it works to it

2557.839 --> 2561.119
it creates proteins and these proteins

2560.24 --> 2562.839
can also

2561.119 --> 2564.8
those are the things that are going to

2562.839 --> 2566.24
shed

2564.8 --> 2579.8390000000004
and those are the things that are going

2566.24 --> 2579.839
to have an influence

2606.0 --> 2610.079
all right amanda young yeah thanks for

2607.599 --> 2610.079
being there

2611.839 --> 2621.839
see you next time

2627.44 --> 2631.04
right yeah well the big issue the

2630.0 --> 2633.599
biggest issue

2631.04 --> 2636.4
with the whole shedding situation and

2633.599 --> 2636.4
the protein

2636.56 --> 2643.2799999999997
is is it permanent

2639.839 --> 2646.64
because then like it's

2643.28 --> 2647.28
a serious risk it's like having a living

2646.64 --> 2653.1189999999997
gmo

2647.28 --> 2653.119
production that doesn't stop

2653.599 --> 2659.839
right it's a serious problem

2657.04 --> 2661.92
on the long run if unless it is all

2659.839 --> 2663.359
basically temporary and the body can

2661.92 --> 2665.2000000000003
overcome it

2663.359 --> 2667.68
but i i don't know if that's even

2665.2 --> 2667.68
possible

2670.319 --> 2676.24
if like the vac scene influences can be

2673.44 --> 2678.2400000000002
undone right or if it literally

2676.24 --> 2681.2799999999997
permanently

2678.24 --> 2684.72
happens like that from that point on

2681.28 --> 2687.5600000000004
in the body i don't know

2684.72 --> 2689.1189999999997
i don't know enough about about the

2687.56 --> 2693.2
microbiology and the

2689.119 --> 2693.2000000000003
rna manipulation technology

2701.04 --> 2705.52
because yeah if it doesn't go away then

2703.52 --> 2706.319
it's almost literally like you suddenly

2705.52 --> 2708.48
have

2706.319 --> 2709.92
instead of having gmo plants in the

2708.48 --> 2711.92
field

2709.92 --> 2714.319
people eating them and then getting

2711.92 --> 2718.319
poison or bad protein or whatever

2714.319 --> 2721.359
from that there will be people walking

2718.319 --> 2724.079
around producing those bad proteins

2721.359 --> 2724.64
and shedding them and then just through

2724.079 --> 2727.92
dust

2724.64 --> 2730.319
you will be getting some of it in

2727.92 --> 2731.599
over time it will be more and more if

2730.319 --> 2736.24
those people in fact

2731.599 --> 2739.119
vaccinated with it keep producing it

2736.24 --> 2739.7599999999998
that continues then over time the amount

2739.119 --> 2742.4
of

2739.76 --> 2743.0400000000004
bad protein that's just floating around

2742.4 --> 2747.839
in dust

2743.04 --> 2747.839
is going to stack

2758.839 --> 2762.88
right

2760.4 --> 2763.599
right yeah when very seriously studied

2762.88 --> 2767.28
doctors

2763.599 --> 2770.6400000000003
talk about how bad these vaccines that

2767.28 --> 2772.88
aren't actually vaccines are

2770.64 --> 2775.839
like they're not over exaggerating

2772.88 --> 2778.1600000000003
they're usually

2775.839 --> 2779.92
downplaying it to make it a little bit

2778.16 --> 2782.0
more comprehensible in the moment and

2779.92 --> 2785.359
not just induce panic attacks

2782.0 --> 2788.0
because it's really bad

2785.359 --> 2789.68
it's not just oh it's all blood no it's

2788.0 --> 2793.2
really bad

2789.68 --> 2793.5989999999997
really really bad not just oh you could

2793.2 --> 2796.72
die

2793.599 --> 2796.7200000000003
or get terrible

2797.52 --> 2801.52
mutilation or what that yeah suddenly

2800.079 --> 2804.96
you could get paralyzed or

2801.52 --> 2808.56
something horrible burns or

2804.96 --> 2810.4
i've seen some weird [ __ ] it's not just

2808.56 --> 2814.0789999999997
that the visible things no it's

2810.4 --> 2816.7200000000003
also long-term effects

2814.079 --> 2819.76
that can burden themselves but

2816.72 --> 2822.56
apparently if this shedding is a serious

2819.76 --> 2824.1600000000003
thing i don't know how many people would

2822.56 --> 2827.119
have that effect

2824.16 --> 2831.839
then that that stacks that is just a

2827.119 --> 2831.839
permanent problem

2832.16 --> 2838.24
depending on if they those people that

2834.48 --> 2844.079
are shedding can even survive

2838.24 --> 2858.0789999999997
right it i guess it all depends on that

2844.079 --> 2861.6800000000003
all right anyway yeah

2858.079 --> 2863.04
if i just lay down what i think it's

2861.68 --> 2866.8799999999997
gonna go towards

2863.04 --> 2866.88
it's just too much man

2869.04 --> 2873.839
it's like

2875.04 --> 2881.92
it's gonna get really bad not even like

2878.0 --> 2881.92
one way or the other it's gonna get bad

2883.28 --> 2889.119
it's gonna be an atrocity one way or the

2886.559 --> 2893.119
other there's no avoid there is no

2889.119 --> 2901.839
way to avoid atrocity there's no way

2893.119 --> 2901.839
it's gonna happen

2913.28 --> 2920.48
right yes moth times well

2917.68 --> 2922.3999999999996
look it all depends the dark it's

2920.48 --> 2924.8
there's gonna be dark times for a lot of

2922.4 --> 2924.8
people

2925.04 --> 2928.4
especially the ones that are that can't

2927.52 --> 2931.839
handle it

2928.4 --> 2937.599
they're gonna have like hell

2931.839 --> 2940.319
to face and some of them are gonna snap

2937.599 --> 2940.839
hopefully not the majority i don't know

2940.319 --> 2944.16
i

2940.839 --> 2947.92
yeah leave it to god

2944.16 --> 2950.0789999999997
god's plan oh god that's why

2947.92 --> 2952.2400000000002
like a month ago i said like what th

2950.079 --> 2954.559
this is god's plan what kind of a plan

2952.24 --> 2957.839
is this right because

2954.559 --> 2957.8390000000004
this is all messed up

2961.44 --> 2964.7200000000003
but yeah for those that are looking

2963.76 --> 2968.8
through this

2964.72 --> 2972.319
are staying clear they're taking

2968.8 --> 2974.7200000000003
like no yeah the coroner's situation

2972.319 --> 2975.7599999999998
very seriously and avoiding the vaccine

2974.72 --> 2980.16
avoiding all that

2975.76 --> 2983.3590000000004
keeping up with their own health and

2980.16 --> 2984.48
as long as there's enough of us i don't

2983.359 --> 2986.72
even know if i'm

2984.48 --> 2987.599
yeah well i'm classified into that yes

2986.72 --> 2992.48
i'm definitely

2987.599 --> 2992.48
completely withdrawn from all of it

2993.44 --> 3001.52
as long as there's enough of us

2997.52 --> 3003.44
and we gain a better grasp on society

3001.52 --> 3004.96
because we got to realize that a whole

3003.44 --> 3008.079
bunch of it

3004.96 --> 3010.96
how it functions right now is gonna is

3008.079 --> 3012.0
gonna stumble down and break like entire

3010.96 --> 3015.599
departments

3012.0 --> 3017.599
sporadically might just collapse

3015.599 --> 3019.52
like suddenly oh this department doesn't

3017.599 --> 3022.8
work anymore yeah they

3019.52 --> 3026.079
they're all extremely sick or

3022.8 --> 3028.88
or like they've all they're all

3026.079 --> 3029.28
permanently sick sadly like that will

3028.88 --> 3032.319
just

3029.28 --> 3032.3190000000004
start happening

3033.2 --> 3037.839
so we got to realize how do we keep

3035.76 --> 3041.0400000000004
things together what is the essential

3037.839 --> 3043.92
infrastructure that we need to

3041.04 --> 3044.96
uphold while everything is stumbling

3043.92 --> 3046.64
down

3044.96 --> 3049.359
there needs to be like complete

3046.64 --> 3049.359
replanning

3050.72 --> 3058.3999999999996
how to keep the essential things going

3054.72 --> 3061.5989999999997
to keep the food infrastructure

3058.4 --> 3061.599
the trade systems

3065.28 --> 3069.8390000000004
the government

3078.48 --> 3083.04
like how can you uphold that with

3081.2 --> 3085.2
basically just a few people

3083.04 --> 3086.319
in a world where everybody suddenly is

3085.2 --> 3090.5989999999997
like under a huge

3086.319 --> 3094.5589999999997
curse with like alzheimer's everywhere

3090.599 --> 3097.599
infertility super bad morality

3094.559 --> 3099.76
a lot of psychological deranged people

3097.599 --> 3101.6800000000003
like that will increase there will be

3099.76 --> 3103.3590000000004
just more people that are gonna snap and

3101.68 --> 3105.9199999999996
they are gonna turn into the deranged

3103.359 --> 3105.92
zombies

3107.04 --> 3114.0
right so how are you gonna uphold

3110.24 --> 3116.72
everything in the middle of all that

3114.0 --> 3118.8
right when just things you've taken for

3116.72 --> 3122.64
granted to keep things under control

3118.8 --> 3125.599
suddenly collapse just like that

3122.64 --> 3127.92
how yeah how do you prevent it all

3125.599 --> 3128.6400000000003
collapsing how do you uphold some kind

3127.92 --> 3130.7200000000003
of basic

3128.64 --> 3133.44
infrastructure in between those types of

3130.72 --> 3135.4399999999996
collapses preparing for when any part of

3133.44 --> 3137.599
it could just

3135.44 --> 3139.92
entire departments of people just drop

3137.599 --> 3139.92
dead

3143.119 --> 3150.0
anyway just

3146.64 --> 3151.7599999999998
just thinking probably a lot of people

3150.0 --> 3154.4
worry about this sort of thing in their

3151.76 --> 3154.4
spare time

3155.839 --> 3159.359
i'm just a theorist really

3163.839 --> 3167.599
stay plugged into jesus well yeah for

3165.92 --> 3169.839
morality

3167.599 --> 3169.839
right

3171.28 --> 3175.0400000000004
the good thing about doing the right

3174.4 --> 3177.28
thing

3175.04 --> 3178.8
trying to do your best trying to avoid

3177.28 --> 3184.2400000000002
the seductions

3178.8 --> 3184.2400000000002
and the doom stay practical

3184.88 --> 3191.44
is that you get used to

3188.0 --> 3194.96
surviving in bad conditions and then

3191.44 --> 3197.52
when like the great demoralization

3194.96 --> 3200.0
really starts to pound on the on the

3197.52 --> 3202.319
whiter people

3200.0 --> 3204.319
then you will have some measure of

3202.319 --> 3207.04
preparation for it mentally

3204.319 --> 3209.52
while other people will go completely

3207.04 --> 3211.88
berserk and bonkers

3209.52 --> 3213.52
right that's why it's

3211.88 --> 3216.079
[Music]

3213.52 --> 3218.319
we're in a better position but yeah how

3216.079 --> 3220.559
much better

3218.319 --> 3222.5589999999997
we're still gonna have to deal and face

3220.559 --> 3225.76
all these people that are potentially

3222.559 --> 3225.76
going out of their minds

3234.839 --> 3237.839
right

3238.53 --> 3241.6490000000003
[Music]

3245.2 --> 3248.96
right and in the meantime i wouldn't be

3248.0 --> 3251.52
surprised if

3248.96 --> 3253.92
if that entire insane community is gonna

3251.52 --> 3256.079
go full on 1984 and

3253.92 --> 3257.44
literally project like everything that

3256.079 --> 3260.0
i've just said

3257.44 --> 3261.2000000000003
i would not be surprised in the

3260.0 --> 3265.52
slightest

3261.2 --> 3267.5989999999997
if the beast actually copies that entire

3265.52 --> 3269.2
thing that i said and flips it around

3267.599 --> 3271.04
180 degrees

3269.2 --> 3273.2799999999997
and then they're gonna talk to each

3271.04 --> 3276.0
other how they need to deal

3273.28 --> 3277.3590000000004
somehow with these mad no vaxxers that

3276.0 --> 3279.599
are

3277.359 --> 3280.96
putting themselves under so much stress

3279.599 --> 3285.3590000000004
for no need because

3280.96 --> 3285.359
just surrender right

3285.599 --> 3292.319
in yeah in the cognitive dissonant world

3288.799 --> 3295.44
where everything is all right until yeah

3292.319 --> 3297.92
something switches in you and you go

3295.44 --> 3299.52
like ah yeah we're all gonna die haha oh

3297.92 --> 3301.76
but everything is all right

3299.52 --> 3302.559
right yeah that they're gonna project

3301.76 --> 3305.76
that [ __ ] on

3302.559 --> 3307.44
us not talking about flat earthers

3305.76 --> 3309.44
necessarily just

3307.44 --> 3311.04
all people that are not going along with

3309.44 --> 3313.599
this madness

3311.04 --> 3313.599
out there

3314.16 --> 3317.92
but they will project it on us

3318.96 --> 3327.2
they will try because our awakenedness

3323.04 --> 3328.0
is like it burns them it will burn them

3327.2 --> 3330.0
literally like

3328.0 --> 3331.44
light burns the shadow away it will burn

3330.0 --> 3335.44
them so they will

3331.44 --> 3337.839
try to flip it 180 degrees

3335.44 --> 3339.839
to somehow cognitive dissonance their

3337.839 --> 3341.599
way through it

3339.839 --> 3344.4
so they don't have to face what we're

3341.599 --> 3344.4
actually saying

3346.88 --> 3351.119
right anyway

3353.359 --> 3360.72
i think you really oh whatever man

3357.599 --> 3360.7200000000003
yeah george sanford

3361.839 --> 3364.64
i'd like to just

3365.359 --> 3372.96
adam told me this too reminded me

3368.4 --> 3372.96
that all of jesus's words are in red

3373.359 --> 3380.24
and that they are key like ki there is a

3377.2 --> 3382.48
like an esoteric key in the words of

3380.24 --> 3385.68
christ

3382.48 --> 3387.92
it's yeah it's very important to realize

3385.68 --> 3387.9199999999996
that

3388.24 --> 3395.2
none of his words are able to be altered

3393.359 --> 3396.72
right so however they're going to

3395.2 --> 3399.4399999999996
arrange rearrange

3396.72 --> 3400.72
bible and however they've done that when

3399.44 --> 3402.96
they've done that or when they're going

3400.72 --> 3404.64
to do that or whatever happens

3402.96 --> 3406.7200000000003
if you want to believe the mandela

3404.64 --> 3411.2
effect whatever

3406.72 --> 3413.52
but the words of jesus cannot be altered

3411.2 --> 3414.799
and that's kind of the that's the flame

3413.52 --> 3418.24
that the entire

3414.799 --> 3421.2
wizard apparatus of the catholic church

3418.24 --> 3422.0789999999997
in the pope and the jesuits what they do

3421.2 --> 3425.839
they are the

3422.079 --> 3427.6800000000003
the mages that hold that flame but they

3425.839 --> 3430.0789999999997
can't alter it

3427.68 --> 3430.799
they have to keep it exactly as is and

3430.079 --> 3434.6400000000003
kind of like

3430.799 --> 3437.28
try to contain it it's very mystical

3434.64 --> 3439.52
when you say it like that but

3437.28 --> 3441.599
i've said it like years ago as well

3439.52 --> 3443.2
that's how i think

3441.599 --> 3444.799
things are transpiring that's why i

3443.2 --> 3446.96
always

3444.799 --> 3449.52
instead of saying like the bible i'll

3446.96 --> 3451.76
just go with christ

3449.52 --> 3453.92
with jesus with his teachings with the

3451.76 --> 3455.119
essence of it right because the essence

3453.92 --> 3458.7200000000003
is more than just

3455.119 --> 3463.04
the words it's

3458.72 --> 3463.7599999999998
how and why and if you have the senses

3463.04 --> 3467.2799999999997
you can

3463.76 --> 3469.2000000000003
pick up those things even without people

3467.28 --> 3473.599
telling you

3469.2 --> 3477.359
there's a certain fractal

3473.599 --> 3481.52
frequency power to it that's just

3477.359 --> 3484.0
yeah beyond understanding

3481.52 --> 3485.68
and it cannot be altered i predicted

3484.0 --> 3487.2
that if they would ever attempt such a

3485.68 --> 3491.359
thing like there might something

3487.2 --> 3494.3999999999996
dramatic might happen so magic contract

3491.359 --> 3498.0
broken or something or

3494.4 --> 3501.119
worse like it would set in disaster

3498.0 --> 3503.839
something like there were his words

3501.119 --> 3503.839
cannot be changed

3504.88 --> 3507.599
i believe this

3513.119 --> 3520.079
so yeah i just consider his words as

3516.4 --> 3524.1600000000003
the great compass the great guidance

3520.079 --> 3528.1600000000003
and the compass he's he is the man

3524.16 --> 3531.2
to lead you through the journey show you

3528.16 --> 3535.359
the best paths thanks to god

3531.2 --> 3536.0
and his design but it's up to you to

3535.359 --> 3538.0789999999997
actually

3536.0 --> 3539.359
overcome your own personal challenges

3538.079 --> 3545.44
and just do it

3539.359 --> 3558.96
and that's the entire point of it

3545.44 --> 3562.0
and it's a lifelong struggle

3558.96 --> 3565.28
okay yeah by the way uh neil i

3562.0 --> 3573.839
i'm not familiar with all the the bible

3565.28 --> 3573.8390000000004
verses and all that

3576.88 --> 3582.4
in the world you have tribulation but be

3579.52 --> 3586.0
of good cheer i have overcome the world

3582.4 --> 3591.119
good point yeah well the awakening is

3586.0 --> 3594.88
like a spiritual fever purging

3591.119 --> 3594.88
the slow disease

3595.44 --> 3598.079
of lies

3598.799 --> 3603.359
in a way esoterically metaphorically

3601.599 --> 3606.96
i've always considered that

3603.359 --> 3611.2799999999997
the process of awakening

3606.96 --> 3615.04
is is the return of christ

3611.28 --> 3619.44
christ the god truth

3615.04 --> 3619.44
truth god christ

3620.319 --> 3627.119
the spirit of truth the spirit of god

3623.359 --> 3628.0789999999997
the holy spirit right the holy spirit

3627.119 --> 3631.28
the spirit

3628.079 --> 3632.0
of truth the holy spirit is sorry it's

3631.28 --> 3634.799
just that

3632.0 --> 3635.92
for me the word truth like the

3634.799 --> 3639.04
information

3635.92 --> 3642.079
effect of truth is

3639.04 --> 3644.5589999999997
also a key part of it and i think that

3642.079 --> 3646.4
in a way the return of christ is the

3644.559 --> 3649.28
return of truth

3646.4 --> 3650.319
through people and in indirect ways i

3649.28 --> 3652.3190000000004
think

3650.319 --> 3654.319
he sort of even predicted that would

3652.319 --> 3656.88
happen and that would be even greater

3654.319 --> 3660.5589999999997
than him

3656.88 --> 3664.799
truth inside awakening to a better way

3660.559 --> 3664.799
a way through right

3665.04 --> 3670.0
anyway this is yeah some things that i

3666.88 --> 3673.52
talked about with

3670.0 --> 3673.52
with adam a while ago

3678.72 --> 3683.359
right and even it's funny to compare it

3681.359 --> 3684.88
for a second to the german new medicine

3683.359 --> 3688.4
and that is that

3684.88 --> 3690.2400000000002
german medicine teaches is first you get

3688.4 --> 3692.7200000000003
some kind of a trauma you don't

3690.24 --> 3696.799
necessarily have to notice it

3692.72 --> 3699.04
usually psychological ties in to a cycle

3696.799 --> 3699.839
and then at the end of the cycle that's

3699.04 --> 3702.96
suddenly when

3699.839 --> 3704.4
symptoms start because it has been

3702.96 --> 3706.88
resolved

3704.4 --> 3708.799
now this is very distinct that

3706.88 --> 3711.28
explanation that you start to notice the

3708.799 --> 3713.839
symptoms when it is resolved when it is

3711.28 --> 3713.8390000000004
over you

3714.079 --> 3720.079
get that like grief in a way

3717.76 --> 3722.6400000000003
that sounds when somebody dies you love

3720.079 --> 3725.28
the grief comes afterward

3722.64 --> 3726.319
it's an after process it's basically the

3725.28 --> 3730.0
healing

3726.319 --> 3731.7599999999998
right the healing is the healing phase

3730.0 --> 3734.079
is when the symptoms start

3731.76 --> 3735.039
showing according to germany medicine so

3734.079 --> 3738.96
maybe

3735.039 --> 3740.96
the awakening and the anguish and the

3738.96 --> 3744.0
cognitive dissonance

3740.96 --> 3747.52
is the healing part

3744.0 --> 3750.0
of the societal mental

3747.52 --> 3750.0
cycle

3752.64 --> 3759.359
it's when when it's ready

3755.68 --> 3759.839
when it's coming out the poison's coming

3759.359 --> 3763.7599999999998
out

3759.839 --> 3767.7599999999998
the pain is coming out because

3763.76 --> 3770.96
that whole situation that this deception

3767.76 --> 3776.0
the false dreams they have bumped

3770.96 --> 3776.0
into yeah into something that

3777.599 --> 3782.2400000000002
just refuses to let it stay the way it

3780.559 --> 3785.119
is it becomes too difficult

3782.24 --> 3785.5989999999997
it becomes too it doesn't work anymore

3785.119 --> 3787.92
so

3785.599 --> 3790.1600000000003
truth is bursting up cognitive

3787.92 --> 3793.52
dissonance is also bursting up

3790.16 --> 3796.319
to try and contain it but it is

3793.52 --> 3798.96
the sign that there basically is you

3796.319 --> 3802.079
could call it an immune response or

3798.96 --> 3804.2400000000002
a healing process because the trauma is

3802.079 --> 3804.7200000000003
already done and now is the healing

3804.24 --> 3807.4399999999996
phase

3804.72 --> 3809.52
the healing phase against the

3807.44 --> 3811.839
overwhelming amount of lies that have

3809.52 --> 3815.839
been rolled out

3811.839 --> 3816.64
collectively this is the healing phase

3815.839 --> 3819.839
that's why

3816.64 --> 3821.44
everybody feels it

3819.839 --> 3823.119
right just like in the german new

3821.44 --> 3826.48
medicine cycle at the end

3823.119 --> 3830.079
when the trauma is actually healed

3826.48 --> 3832.799
that's when you start to feel it

3830.079 --> 3834.6400000000003
for one last period and then it really

3832.799 --> 3837.28
resolves and goes away and you're like

3834.64 --> 3840.4
new after that

3837.28 --> 3842.3190000000004
right i'd like to think that we're like

3840.4 --> 3844.88
to compare it to that

3842.319 --> 3847.359
because it also makes me hopeful that

3844.88 --> 3849.6800000000003
it's not just gonna leave some terrible

3847.359 --> 3852.24
terrible

3849.68 --> 3852.96
mental scar that we could never overcome

3852.24 --> 3856.319
or something

3852.96 --> 3859.359
right no it's it's much i'd

3856.319 --> 3863.0389999999998
much rather like to see it as

3859.359 --> 3866.0789999999997

breaking off the train of thought i

3980.88 --> 3987.039
think that that is like a

3983.28 --> 3988.88
a long-term systemic problem with me

3987.039 --> 3991.2000000000003
is that when i go into really deeper

3988.88 --> 3993.599
thoughts and sometimes i

3991.2 --> 3995.2
risk suddenly the train of thought

3993.599 --> 3996.48
completely breaks and then i can't

3995.2 --> 3998.72
continue it

3996.48 --> 3998.72
