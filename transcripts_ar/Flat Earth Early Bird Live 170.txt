what happened just a day I went to bed

134.93 --> 142.73000000000002
really early like really early I think

142.73 --> 149.86999999999998
my doing it's very early also thanks to

145.61 --> 153.94000000000003
the wine but I just felt like I needed a

149.87 --> 163.85
good night's sleep anyway and I got it

153.94 --> 170.69
so I feel great yeah

163.85 --> 174.2
yesterday the debates just seriously

170.69 --> 176.35999999999999
when John and Slick James get into a

174.2 --> 181.51999999999998
feedback loop with one another and they

176.36 --> 184.64000000000001
judge both and John starts to do his

181.52 --> 187.959
patronizing thing and then slick John

184.64 --> 197.11999999999998
does his intimidation thing and just

187.959 --> 199.519
norm conformations any condition I find

197.12 --> 201.61
it kind of tedious it's not going

199.519 --> 201.61
anywhere

207.04 --> 213.45999999999998
yeah what else is going on let's see

215.93 --> 218.93
whoa

228.4 --> 237.26
okay somebody dropped a piece of

230.78 --> 239.87
furniture or something right

237.26 --> 242.42
yeah lots of comment back and forth Ori

239.87 --> 246.89000000000001
sheets show is incredibly late still

242.42 --> 250.11999999999998
life he may have just ended but I wasn't

246.89 --> 250.11999999999998
his chat a little earlier

259.5 --> 265.28
yep nah it's not a lot a lot has

263.25 --> 265.28
happened

282.039 --> 285.389
Oh Jeffrey bail

292.55 --> 300.31
right

294.639 --> 303.439
Jesus okay somebody's moving furniture

300.31 --> 308.06
just can get very loud they bump into

303.439 --> 311.15000000000003
things like their railing it's like a

308.06 --> 314.419
tuning fork on the side that you could

311.15 --> 318.289
yeah this floor has one as well but it

314.419 --> 320.419
stretches all the way this thing here in

318.289 --> 322.039
front stretches all the way from one

320.419 --> 324.289
side through the building to the other

322.039 --> 326.479
so it's literally like a tuning fork

324.289 --> 329.93
every time Simon every time somebody

326.479 --> 334.36
taps it or hits it if you hit it hard

329.93 --> 337.039
you hear it very loudly it's crazy

334.36 --> 341.469
well yeah it could serve as an alarm

337.039 --> 348.02
function in certain type of situations

341.469 --> 350.84
what anyway let's not get too distracted

348.02 --> 355.19
yeah the conversation yesterday went on

350.84 --> 357.73999999999995
quite long was interesting it was funny

355.19 --> 363.56
or interesting to kind of with the dust2

357.74 --> 368.719
year 68 to dive into that yeah that

363.56 --> 369.86
region of debate about races and and

368.719 --> 374.18
what is really happening out there

369.86 --> 378.16900000000004
because I I have my analysis about that

374.18 --> 383.12
as well I've been doing that for four

378.169 --> 384.74
decades so I have a lot to share about

383.12 --> 386.569
that kind of thing as well but it's not

384.74 --> 393.8
something I'd like to bring up naturally

386.569 --> 396.77000000000004
because because of this because of all

393.8 --> 400.129
the trolling and the Marxist accusations

396.77 --> 403.02
and [ __ ] that tend to go around as

400.129 --> 406.23
soon as you bring up those subjects

403.02 --> 406.22999999999996
[Music]

419.61 --> 428.009
all right PJ hello it's weird when

424.949 --> 432.229
somebody pops in with a question like a

428.009 --> 435.33000000000004
denial question like that look I am NOT

432.229 --> 439.06899999999996
saying it's not possible to be from a

435.33 --> 442.919
single source told you this at the start

439.069 --> 445.5
when I asked you to explain that our

442.919 --> 447.599
Stark is theory and I agreed with you

445.5 --> 459.3
the problem is you don't actually move

447.599 --> 462.78
beyond that all right bill G I'm a red

459.3 --> 469.199
wine guy definitely I don't like white

462.78 --> 474.79999999999995
wine at all there's not any health

469.199 --> 478.65000000000003
benefits really in in it red wine is so

474.8 --> 491.699
does have benefits if you don't overdo

478.65 --> 495.35999999999996
it by the way I got a new like ultra

491.699 --> 498.18
supermarket basic but it is organic and

495.36 --> 502.099
it's clearly on it in Spanish but like

498.18 --> 505.379
ya can get more basic label than this

502.099 --> 510.389
but yeah I'd love to try it out it was

505.379 --> 512.399
kind of cheap obviously I'm not gonna do

510.389 --> 516.289
that right now during a breakfast show

512.399 --> 516.289
I'm not French

523.269 --> 532.3100000000001
50p wine no way no no no no no now for

529.1 --> 536.0
organic wine it's and in Dutch prices

532.31 --> 542.3889999999999
it's not expensive but it's definitely

536.0 --> 549.769
no it was like four euros I think

542.389 --> 552.529
something like that could be a lot more

549.769 --> 555.05
expensive there's like red wines organic

552.529 --> 557.449
ones in between the selection of and it

555.05 --> 563.24
is a supermarket format so there's not

557.449 --> 566.5999999999999
extremely yeah luxurious expensive wines

563.24 --> 569.66
there but it ranges from well pretty

566.6 --> 573.3190000000001
much 350 or 4 euros depending if there's

569.66 --> 575.93
a discount on something to 10 euros so

573.319 --> 580.029
this is cheap for organic wine it's

575.93 --> 584.38
still expensive compared to just general

580.029 --> 588.73
probably compared to American prices

584.38 --> 590.62
well there's a lot of taxes here

588.73 --> 597.519
value-added taxes I think it's

590.62 --> 602.98
translated a lot of it and extra taxes

597.519 --> 602.98
involving alcohol as well and new yeah

609.22 --> 614.899
anyway yeah I wanted some red wine I

612.199 --> 617.66
feel in the right mood and I haven't

614.899 --> 624.529
drank for a long time a long time I

617.66 --> 628.069
think like two weeks though that's not

624.529 --> 630.23
entirely true I haven't had a red wine

628.069 --> 634.7299999999999
for a long time but I did of course

630.23 --> 639.94
drink beer during the D&D that was last

634.73 --> 639.94
week right

653.95 --> 658.86
what what aren't you guys talking about

660.33 --> 663.0500000000001
yeah

664.29 --> 673.26
indeed misty cognate II organic wine is

668.91 --> 676.14
better absolutely better and only those

673.26 --> 680.43
people completely deregulated and

676.14 --> 685.1999999999999
desensitized by flavor enhancers of all

680.43 --> 687.7199999999999
kinds like the sugar replacements the

685.2 --> 693.0300000000001
chemical crap that really is what it

687.72 --> 695.4300000000001
does to your to your senses and msg if

693.03 --> 697.02
you are used to that [ __ ] then you're

695.43 --> 699.0
not actually going to taste much

697.02 --> 702.09
difference with organic wine this is

699.0 --> 704.49
really true and I've experienced that in

702.09 --> 707.99
the past before I started eating organic

704.49 --> 711.12
then I stepped away from it and suddenly

707.99 --> 715.29
suddenly my senses just cleared up the

711.12 --> 717.75
poison that damped it all down that that

715.29 --> 720.39
blurred it all out just went away and

717.75 --> 722.79
suddenly it was like oh my god this is

720.39 --> 727.05
organic wine that is not organic wine I

722.79 --> 728.9399999999999
don't even have to like ask or see a

727.05 --> 734.1899999999999
label I can just taste the difference

728.94 --> 744.32
very very strongly so yeah

734.19 --> 744.32
[Music]

757.45 --> 760.6600000000001
all right

781.389 --> 788.41
you need to stop being a whiny

783.829 --> 788.41
complaining pants twin saya

793.4 --> 798.56
maybe we should like pay more attention

795.26 --> 804.53
to Daniel follow his example because he

798.56 --> 807.56
is kind of pushy baller but at least

804.53 --> 809.42
he's not a whiny complaining pants if

807.56 --> 813.8299999999999
you tell him to shut up he actually

809.42 --> 817.5799999999999
shuts up he's just he wants progress

813.83 --> 819.47
like with what he's doing you yeah I

817.58 --> 822.08
mean I don't care about your complaining

819.47 --> 824.6
attitude and oh my god there's been time

822.08 --> 826.25
now it's so terrible yeah if you're

824.6 --> 828.02
gonna do that I will time you and if you

826.25 --> 832.39
keep on complaining about I'll ban you

828.02 --> 837.35
so it's better to just focus on well

832.39 --> 840.59
more useful a more useful way to spend

837.35 --> 844.8100000000001
your time maybe just asking questions

840.59 --> 844.8100000000001
getting to a point something like that

846.4 --> 849.4
yeah

852.8 --> 856.01
[Music]

859.95 --> 862.5500000000001
yeah

869.5 --> 874.79
all right that's funny you mention that

872.66 --> 875.9
Jeffrey Bale slickest like a spanner in

874.79 --> 878.9599999999999
the works I don't know

875.9 --> 884.4499999999999
wouldn't call it a spanner I'd rather

878.96 --> 886.37
call it like a mouse that accidentally

884.45 --> 888.44
jumped in the gearbox and now the

886.37 --> 895.12
gearbox is stuck with the mouse corpse

888.44 --> 895.12
in it of course you know what I mean

899.399 --> 904.22
let me

902.24 --> 911.48
you know exactly what I mean and why

904.22 --> 914.2
would be that sadistic about it that's

911.48 --> 914.2
very obvious

916.56 --> 919.31
all right

928.49 --> 933.59
because spanners can actually fix things

937.27 --> 948.98
and I don't know Slick James doesn't

943.43 --> 951.14
really establish a lot he just

948.98 --> 953.03
established a lot of ground rules by

951.14 --> 955.01
which he tries to dominate everyone

953.03 --> 957.67
that's pretty much the only thing he's

955.01 --> 957.67
establishing

975.79 --> 981.4599999999999
I really have a question for me I have a

978.4 --> 984.34
question for you too why why are you so

981.46 --> 990.46
afraid to basically go into a debate

984.34 --> 993.4
with somebody life already so attached

990.46 --> 998.44
to your safe space it's really kind of

993.4 --> 1001.59
sad I don't see how somebody like you

998.44 --> 1004.6800000000001
that's just too afraid to even confront

1001.59 --> 1006.75
people life to deal with that how

1004.68 --> 1008.0699999999999
somebody like you could naturally have

1006.75 --> 1011.22
so many subscribers

1008.07 --> 1013.44
it just seems really pathetic that

1011.22 --> 1019.22
people would latch on to that it's just

1013.44 --> 1019.22
loose but anyway ask away

1022.66 --> 1036.209
[Music]

1031.41 --> 1038.8500000000001
ah that's very convenient rule it's just

1036.209 --> 1040.8600000000001
like slick James makes his rules like

1038.85 --> 1043.829
yeah he doesn't answer your question

1040.86 --> 1047.25
when people ask them about him

1043.829 --> 1049.83
well that's his rule well it's a [ __ ]

1047.25 --> 1052.47
rule and it blocks [ __ ] and it's very

1049.83 --> 1057.1999999999998
very convenient and it's very obviously

1052.47 --> 1057.2
cowardice of you Simon then

1080.96 --> 1084.599
[Music]

1089.3 --> 1092.74
[Music]

1091.47 --> 1098.3700000000001
you

1092.74 --> 1098.3700000000001
hey good morning chocolate Ronnie fashi

1101.99 --> 1105.279
mark of Melbourne

1107.37 --> 1110.59
[Music]

1111.639 --> 1118.6899999999998
well done well done

1113.98 --> 1121.59
goodbye I told you what what happens

1118.69 --> 1125.8500000000001
when saya I told you what what happened

1121.59 --> 1125.85
she just couldn't help it good

1131.03 --> 1137.869
[Music]

1132.71 --> 1141.049
oh right tennis memorizing yeah but it

1137.869 --> 1145.269
was such an open goal like he literally

1141.049 --> 1145.269
made that statement about somebody and

1145.99 --> 1153.529
then within 30 seconds proceeded to yeah

1152.08 --> 1159.019
literally

1153.529 --> 1161.96
show that so it was just slick claiming

1159.019 --> 1164.119
that information that he's saying goes

1161.96 --> 1171.039
over other people's head is just

1164.119 --> 1171.039
hysterical that is so laughably dumb

1172.899 --> 1181.85
because I think that he's so basic that

1177.11 --> 1184.369
he's probably kind of starting up

1181.85 --> 1186.289
conspiracies in other people's minds

1184.369 --> 1188.509
that just can't believe a person can be

1186.289 --> 1191.99
that stupid and basic he must be hiding

1188.509 --> 1195.679
something you must but he's probably not

1191.99 --> 1201.169
he probably is really that dumb that's

1195.679 --> 1204.2
simple he is a simpleton but we can't

1201.169 --> 1210.3790000000001
believe it that's the funny thing about

1204.2 --> 1214.159
it he's almost like like mr. gardener

1210.379 --> 1215.9189999999999
from Rd guardare Chauncey Gardiner from

1214.159 --> 1219.88
Rain Man

1215.919 --> 1223.5890000000002
except yeah more aggressive

1219.88 --> 1223.5890000000002
[Music]

1225.67 --> 1228.8490000000002
[Music]

1228.99 --> 1238.89
tell me what you think of my comparison

1230.97 --> 1241.799
Slick James I think the Cavendish

1238.89 --> 1244.95
experiment is ridiculous it's supposedly

1241.799 --> 1248.1589999999999
gonna weigh the earth that's what it was

1244.95 --> 1252.21
that designed for and that doesn't make

1248.159 --> 1258.47
any damn sense it's it's a deduction

1252.21 --> 1261.8700000000001
based trickery it's it's it's literally

1258.47 --> 1266.76
trickery because it does you can't

1261.87 --> 1275.309
literally weigh the earth like that it's

1266.76 --> 1278.34
ridiculous and it definitely does not

1275.309 --> 1281.73
prove gravity it presupposes gravity it

1278.34 --> 1284.1899999999998
assumes it that's why in the formulas

1281.73 --> 1287.01
the G is always there but it's never the

1284.19 --> 1290.22
independent variable so the Cavendish

1287.01 --> 1292.95
experiment definitely does not prove

1290.22 --> 1295.08
gravity nor was it officially designed

1292.95 --> 1299.25
to do that even it's a common

1295.08 --> 1301.9499999999998
misconception I I used to think it as

1299.25 --> 1304.559
well everybody was saying that that it's

1301.95 --> 1306.48
that the Cavendish experiment supposedly

1304.559 --> 1308.69
proves gravity it does not it was the

1306.48 --> 1312.35
designated to weigh the earth and

1308.69 --> 1312.3500000000001
gravity is in it

1317.7 --> 1321.409
Hey hello des to you

1333.73 --> 1336.3600000000001
yeah

1337.07 --> 1344.71
what Simon then you drink energy gels

1350.72 --> 1359.1100000000001
yeah and what question I just talking

1366.78 --> 1369.26
at

1375.6 --> 1384.0
hmm all right that's actually Wow an

1380.32 --> 1393.6399999999999
interesting question the question that I

1384.0 --> 1395.919
can't really tell right away yes sorry

1393.64 --> 1399.429
Simon dad it got lot that question god

1395.919 --> 1402.6100000000001
I'll I read out quote you ever posted

1399.429 --> 1406.5
the question got lost in the giant jet

1402.61 --> 1406.5
thing and me talking hats like James

1406.919 --> 1411.97
sorry about that

1409.809 --> 1415.0
that's a good question I guess where's

1411.97 --> 1418.24
the carbon coming from where is all the

1415.0 --> 1423.159
types of matter that we know coming from

1418.24 --> 1427.679
that's a very good question how did it

1423.159 --> 1430.75
arise was it all there from the start

1427.679 --> 1432.99
yeah even from a creation perspective

1430.75 --> 1436.75
that's still an interesting question

1432.99 --> 1440.019
like what did it all start out with and

1436.75 --> 1444.279
what came later what eventually

1440.019 --> 1447.94
transformed into what it is now so good

1444.279 --> 1449.07
question I I don't know the answer to

1447.94 --> 1452.24
the question

1449.07 --> 1452.24
[Music]

1455.84 --> 1458.9299999999998
[Music]

1460.84 --> 1467.83
right well I'm not really interested in

1463.929 --> 1469.99
your yeah you're just so stories if at

1467.83 --> 1472.09
the fantasy stories about the ball earth

1469.99 --> 1474.519
and how all the matter is supposed to

1472.09 --> 1478.9189999999999
like how metals come from the Sun and

1474.519 --> 1482.769
all that it's a really interesting

1478.919 --> 1485.259
materialistic presuppositional cosmo GD

1482.769 --> 1487.09
thing I kind of like doing that when I

1485.259 --> 1491.2
was younger but it is completely

1487.09 --> 1494.259
pointless totally pointless so I'm not

1491.2 --> 1497.94
really interested in that you probably

1494.259 --> 1497.94
have a lot of fantasy stories about it

1511.24 --> 1519.29
illogical well if you presuppose the

1516.83 --> 1522.32
heliocentric system then no it's not

1519.29 --> 1525.17
illogical but the heliocentric system is

1522.32 --> 1527.5
illogical so in that sense yes it is

1525.17 --> 1527.5
illogical

1541.08 --> 1546.6899999999998
yeah carbon comes from burnt toast

1559.549 --> 1563.27
right so

1566.34 --> 1576.149
Carbon seems to be involved with fire a

1568.889 --> 1580.9789999999998
lot one way or the other so yeah you

1576.149 --> 1583.32
know if I'd had back in the day when I

1580.979 --> 1586.32
was still being into the elements and

1583.32 --> 1588.779
all that kind of Wicca thinking I would

1586.32 --> 1591.599
rearrange it saying that basically

1588.779 --> 1597.57
fought both fire and water created life

1591.599 --> 1600.119
and yeah Oh carbon from fire and while

1597.57 --> 1607.1689999999999
water is obviously a critical part of

1600.119 --> 1609.57
her of organic life sunlight could be

1607.169 --> 1613.289
categorized categorized as fire although

1609.57 --> 1614.519
also ether so yeah they goody that's

1613.289 --> 1620.219
another way to approach it

1614.519 --> 1622.799
I don't know how was it designed you

1620.219 --> 1632.219
know we can make up as much that things

1622.799 --> 1636.029
have been designed obviously but how it

1632.219 --> 1639.089
was designed it's not a matter we even

1636.029 --> 1640.739
know how to redesign somewhat genetic

1639.089 --> 1644.999
engineering but it's still very

1640.739 --> 1648.809
primitive it's really cosmetic mostly

1644.999 --> 1651.299
but how it was eventually probably

1648.809 --> 1653.999
figure out how to completely design from

1651.299 --> 1657.179
scratch scratch but it's mostly gonna be

1653.999 --> 1661.019
still building blocks that still exist

1657.179 --> 1665.8490000000002
so how was that originally brought into

1661.019 --> 1670.499
being now there is something that is

1665.849 --> 1674.789
highly complex and yeah the only real

1670.499 --> 1677.249
thing we that I get to go on the only

1674.789 --> 1680.489
reference even to this is the Adam and

1677.249 --> 1683.159
Eve story from the clay but how do you

1680.489 --> 1686.179
even interpret that you can go so many

1683.159 --> 1686.179
directions with it

1688.48 --> 1697.81
but yeah people like for example Jay

1691.55 --> 1702.08
dreamer suggests and I I can't say I

1697.81 --> 1702.5
hadda mentally disagree but I'm not sure

1702.08 --> 1706.22
of it

1702.5 --> 1711.64
but he says that basically all animal

1706.22 --> 1715.43
life before was silicon-based and not

1711.64 --> 1718.3100000000002
flash-based like this and it turned from

1715.43 --> 1723.5
silicon to carbon was transformed

1718.31 --> 1727.4299999999998
somehow he literally says yeah pretty

1723.5 --> 1729.77
much through magic or alchemy look he

1727.43 --> 1733.01
likes the really dream on about that's

1729.77 --> 1736.97
his thing jay dreamers it's very good at

1733.01 --> 1739.28
telling those stories but yeah it does

1736.97 --> 1745.31
presuppose a lot it's really his thing

1739.28 --> 1748.43
but it's interesting I'm not entirely

1745.31 --> 1753.55
against that humanity may be offspring

1748.43 --> 1753.55
of original silicon-based life

1770.84 --> 1775.6
Oh PJ you make it sound so grim

1789.58 --> 1797.35
that's hilarious Jason mcCormick well if

1794.59 --> 1800.4399999999998
you presuppose that Aristarchus is

1797.35 --> 1803.8
literally a crater on a physical moon

1800.44 --> 1812.2
then yes the creator of Aristarchus is

1803.8 --> 1814.6
concave correct but on the other hand if

1812.2 --> 1815.89
it is a decapitated tree it's not going

1814.6 --> 1820.3899999999999
to be concave if it's going to be pretty

1815.89 --> 1822.69
much flat and if it is just the moon the

1820.39 --> 1829.74
apparent moon crater it's nothing but a

1822.69 --> 1829.74
yeah an apparent crater it's just light

1829.83 --> 1833.98
yeah

1831.1 --> 1836.28
Jason McCormick I got the joke it's a

1833.98 --> 1836.28
good one

1857.35 --> 1862.87
all right another question from Simon

1859.87 --> 1866.32
and I did see it first do you believe in

1862.87 --> 1875.07
the traditional atomic theory protons

1866.32 --> 1881.139
neutrons electrons well not all of it

1875.07 --> 1885.009
but yeah it's a model protons neutrons

1881.139 --> 1888.309
electrons any it kind of works but what

1885.009 --> 1892.179
they describe it literally is something

1888.309 --> 1896.94
else I think I'm not like I I'm not

1892.179 --> 1901.0
convinced of the small supposed matter

1896.94 --> 1905.71
based unit particles indivisible units

1901.0 --> 1907.45
that are like yeah that the space is

1905.71 --> 1909.669
pretty much filled up with a vacuum that

1907.45 --> 1913.47
that conceptualisation I don't go for

1909.669 --> 1913.47
that and electrons are not

1914.75 --> 1920.33
I think they're energy quanta rather I

1917.99 --> 1922.4
think it's much like light although I'm

1920.33 --> 1924.74
not entirely certain it's very difficult

1922.4 --> 1926.419
I know more or I've conceptualize more

1924.74 --> 1929.57
about light than I have about electrons

1926.419 --> 1932.419
but I think that electrons should

1929.57 --> 1938.03
probably just be called Negatron because

1932.419 --> 1943.01
then it shows the specific function that

1938.03 --> 1944.69
it has within that system that's the

1943.01 --> 1951.28
balance between the protons and the

1944.69 --> 1951.28
electrons or the Megatron's but

1954.37 --> 1962.1
as for what it is it a really a micro

1957.789 --> 1966.429
particle I don't think so

1962.1 --> 1970.6899999999998
are these like you can't really detect

1966.429 --> 1973.6000000000001
them see look matter you can detect you

1970.69 --> 1979.299
can actually scan it you can electron

1973.6 --> 1983.1
microscope scan surface up to I think

1979.299 --> 1987.25
atomic level or at least molecular level

1983.1 --> 1990.1
and you can do that with protons

1987.25 --> 1992.77
neutrons and electrons you can only

1990.1 --> 1995.529
deduce that it is there just like with

1992.77 --> 1997.779
lights through interaction with matter

1995.529 --> 2002.789
because the matter is the real thing

1997.779 --> 2009.48
that we can only truly touch that we can

2002.789 --> 2011.429
grasp now we can scan so yeah it's a

2009.48 --> 2014.3700000000001
deduction based system and it kind of

2011.429 --> 2016.14
works similar to chemistry not saying

2014.37 --> 2023.07
that chemistry is wrong a definitely

2016.14 --> 2026.19
chemistry is correct but yeah all these

2023.07 --> 2028.86
theories are generally just subjected to

2026.19 --> 2032.24
particle ization big making everything

2028.86 --> 2035.6689999999999
everything into little balls with yeah

2032.24 --> 2038.54
as the macro cosmos so is the micro

2035.669 --> 2041.73
cosmos everything is turned into balls

2038.54 --> 2041.73
[Music]

2042.41 --> 2049.379
balls and vacuum that's what they do

2045.99 --> 2052.01
hey I'm Jayden by guest hello that

2049.379 --> 2054.44
studios welcome back

2052.01 --> 2061.57
can I have one how are you right

2054.44 --> 2064.82
hello I can't hear you

2061.57 --> 2064.82
[Music]

2065.55 --> 2068.48
you're on mute

2073.24 --> 2082.8089999999997
as that yeah I can hear you know hello

2076.829 --> 2083.639
beauty hey might yeah doing good that's

2082.809 --> 2087.369
good mine

2083.639 --> 2087.849
yeah and how are you doing uh not too

2087.369 --> 2091.6490000000003
bad

2087.849 --> 2092.8590000000004
yeah not enjoying the Melbourne autumn

2091.649 --> 2098.859
mm-hmm

2092.859 --> 2104.47
it's very it's still very warm yeah

2098.859 --> 2106.69
spent 25 today 25 degrees so yeah it's

2104.47 --> 2113.5
still very nice winter hasn't quite hit

2106.69 --> 2115.859
yet all right yeah you're in the season

2113.5 --> 2121.78
there so you're still in the late autumn

2115.859 --> 2124.27
right that's right yeah hmm very weird

2121.78 --> 2129.46
that is completely switched around so

2124.27 --> 2132.69
surreal it is when it's really hot to

2129.46 --> 2138.7
think that's snowing somewhere right

2132.69 --> 2142.78
yeah like when Americans come to

2138.7 --> 2146.5589999999997
Australia and they have a Christmases in

2142.78 --> 2148.059
summer you know and they're just it's

2146.559 --> 2149.4700000000003
just such a winter thing over there so

2148.059 --> 2153.9
when they come here it's like oh wow

2149.47 --> 2156.4599999999996
it's really weird it's all Kolbe air and

2153.9 --> 2158.71
right shrimpson so how is the

2156.46 --> 2160.869
merchandise even because like it's

2158.71 --> 2163.0
widely merchandised Christmas and

2160.869 --> 2166.4500000000003
everything with snow and everything that

2163.0 --> 2169.03
comes with that standard visual so how

2166.45 --> 2174.0099999999998
does that work in the in Australia for

2169.03 --> 2176.549
example they just do it like like oh

2174.01 --> 2181.03
look snow it's so nice and cold in heat

2176.549 --> 2184.24
all right well yeah parents sometimes

2181.03 --> 2188.309
get why causing sugar or something and

2184.24 --> 2191.29
sprinkle it all over the oh when they do

2188.309 --> 2193.69
people do have fake snow sort of stuff

2191.29 --> 2197.98
on the house sometimes but yeah there is

2193.69 --> 2199.96
still an element of snow mm-hmm because

2197.98 --> 2203.51
he's from the North Pole as well so it's

2199.96 --> 2207.56
real loose right right

2203.51 --> 2211.2900000000004
I used to work at Australia Post and

2207.56 --> 2215.22
they they still accept letters from kids

2211.29 --> 2218.1
to Santa from the North Pole to the

2215.22 --> 2220.74
North Pole mm-hmm and when we post we

2218.1 --> 2222.74
don't and post them but they get a reply

2220.74 --> 2225.6299999999997
everyone who writes a letter to Santa

2222.74 --> 2231.0899999999997
all the kiddies they get straight posts

2225.63 --> 2232.9500000000003
in them replies which is cute in the

2231.09 --> 2235.11
Netherlands we don't do that we have

2232.95 --> 2237.5099999999998
sinter Klass which is basically the

2235.11 --> 2239.4300000000003
Dutch well it's a live word what it was

2237.51 --> 2242.3100000000004
originally based on really Americans

2239.43 --> 2245.6699999999996
stole our sinter Klass and turned him

2242.31 --> 2248.25
into a yeah a fat Santa that flies on

2245.67 --> 2251.94
with reindeer and weird [ __ ] we hear he

2248.25 --> 2252.75
just walks he just rides the rooftops on

2251.94 --> 2256.76
his horse

2252.75 --> 2260.31
that's all that's what he doesn't fly

2256.76 --> 2262.11
it's just really a nimble somehow

2260.31 --> 2266.07
especially the horse it's it's still

2262.11 --> 2268.17
kind of weird but yeah here he doesn't

2266.07 --> 2271.17
come from the North Pole he just comes

2268.17 --> 2273.1800000000003
from Spain okay

2271.17 --> 2275.4
oh that's interesting it's even like

2273.18 --> 2277.23
mythologized he's from a specific place

2275.4 --> 2279.44
although they keep it vague where his

2277.23 --> 2282.98
supposed residence is supposed to be

2279.44 --> 2286.71
something like that it's like on the TV

2282.98 --> 2288.63
they they have like entire kit shows

2286.71 --> 2291.33
they they make days out of it where the

2288.63 --> 2294.27
presenter just feels in this fairytale

2291.33 --> 2297.2999999999997
story about Santa Claus and what he's

2294.27 --> 2299.46
supposedly doing and it's I don't know

2297.3 --> 2304.29
it's kind of funny I always thought it

2299.46 --> 2305.91
was kind of charming but he doesn't come

2304.29 --> 2311.39
from the North Pole so we just send a

2305.91 --> 2314.19
mail to Spain yeah that was coca-cola's

2311.39 --> 2319.08
invention or Santa Claus basically yeah

2314.19 --> 2321.65
yeah crazy isn't it no it's a company

2319.08 --> 2321.65
invention

2324.44 --> 2327.739
yeah so just to follow up on what we

2326.239 --> 2331.19
talked about yesterday I really wanted

2327.739 --> 2334.46
to just write some criticism about that

2331.19 --> 2337.43
by the way uh yeah there was a few

2334.46 --> 2339.71
people who were calling me racist in the

2337.43 --> 2341.21
comments os fair enough if you think I'm

2339.71 --> 2345.89
racist it's fine really

2341.21 --> 2347.779
um that okay okay hmm

2345.89 --> 2350.15
well doesn't really have any money

2347.779 --> 2354.68
anymore oh yeah let's just say that this

2350.15 --> 2362.0190000000002
show does not like I I do kind of care

2354.68 --> 2366.469
but I try to not let racism phobia like

2362.019 --> 2369.4689999999996
for enforce people to basically over

2366.469 --> 2371.719
generalize everyone and say that nobody

2369.469 --> 2374.39
has any differences that I always like

2371.719 --> 2377.509
to emphasize the differences and the bad

2374.39 --> 2380.5389999999998
from the goods so sigh meeow so I mean

2377.509 --> 2384.68
that's not Isis it's only racist when

2380.539 --> 2387.1400000000003
you do actually over generalize and it

2384.68 --> 2388.7889999999998
the conversation kind of did start out

2387.14 --> 2391.759
about that a bit but I don't think it

2388.789 --> 2395.3900000000003
was specifically meant to do that

2391.759 --> 2397.039
hmm so and eventually it yeah the whole

2395.39 --> 2400.16
conversation was pretty good and long

2397.039 --> 2401.1090000000004
and smooth out and I yeah I thought it

2400.16 --> 2403.729
was very good

2401.109 --> 2405.68
yeah but again I don't want to come on

2403.729 --> 2408.589
here and or any sort of lighter the show

2405.68 --> 2409.999
and talk about this stuff but as a list

2408.589 --> 2411.859
regular listener to the Flat Earth

2409.999 --> 2412.519
debate I feel it's being shoved in my

2411.859 --> 2415.269
throat

2412.519 --> 2417.769
so I've you know I feel like I need to

2415.269 --> 2420.279
if that's what we're talking about then

2417.769 --> 2424.1499999999996
you know that's what we're talking about

2420.279 --> 2428.739
right anger and that sort of thing but I

2424.15 --> 2432.099
think just generally people everywhere

2428.739 --> 2434.21
you need to get it robbed the appearance

2432.099 --> 2439.19
you know that's very important if you

2434.21 --> 2443.059
don't if you don't love your father then

2439.19 --> 2444.109
you can't love anyone else and you

2443.059 --> 2445.1600000000003
especially your mother you won't love

2444.109 --> 2450.319
your mother if you don't love your

2445.16 --> 2450.8289999999997
father and then through your you must

2450.319 --> 2452.599
love your father

2450.829 --> 2454.579
even then you you can't father don't

2452.599 --> 2456.4100000000003
love your mother hello Chris right away

2454.579 --> 2461.78
thanks for joining

2456.41 --> 2464.0899999999997
hey Chris hey guys thank you but you

2461.78 --> 2468.02
mean hi your earthly father yours

2464.09 --> 2470.15
yeah your dad your dad yeah so you gotta

2468.02 --> 2472.61
love your mum and dad regardless if

2470.15 --> 2475.9100000000003
they've done bad to you then you have to

2472.61 --> 2479.33
forgive them otherwise you'll just be

2475.91 --> 2482.83
you know continue in the circle spiral

2479.33 --> 2485.81
of anger mm-hmm and aggression and

2482.83 --> 2490.79
violence bullying threatening kind of

2485.81 --> 2495.65
behavior yes and you know it's not

2490.79 --> 2498.98
honest and it's not acceptable so but

2495.65 --> 2500.57
that's it's just you're people really

2498.98 --> 2502.67
need to get and if you if you don't love

2500.57 --> 2505.4
your father for whatever reason then you

2502.67 --> 2508.88
can't love God tell Jesus your

2505.4 --> 2510.9500000000003
connection correct correct so I had I

2508.88 --> 2513.04
started out like I have a very good

2510.95 --> 2516.3199999999997
relationship with my dad right now

2513.04 --> 2516.92
yeah 20 years ago that was absolutely

2516.32 --> 2521.06
not the case

2516.92 --> 2523.1
and my problem was is that I couldn't

2521.06 --> 2527.18
because he basically didn't respect

2523.1 --> 2531.0499999999997
himself and when that's the case you

2527.18 --> 2533.2999999999997
can't because when you try it gets

2531.05 --> 2536.4500000000003
deflected it gets either deflected

2533.3 --> 2539.44
dismissed or just not recognized because

2536.45 --> 2543.79
if your dad can't respect themselves

2539.44 --> 2543.79
you just can't love them it's impossible

2546.25 --> 2554.75
yeah do like bad things secret things

2551.24 --> 2557.4799999999996
just yeah kind of like juvenile behavior

2554.75 --> 2560.3
for somebody that's really yeah way too

2557.48 --> 2562.16
old for it and a lot of people have that

2560.3 --> 2564.67
a lot of men especially a lot of women

2562.16 --> 2569.6
too by the way but different type

2564.67 --> 2573.23
behaviors and yeah if your dad doesn't

2569.6 --> 2575.36
have any respect for themselves then if

2573.23 --> 2576.83
they have unresolved issues that they

2575.36 --> 2578.81
just and they don't want to talk about

2576.83 --> 2580.91
it they never change they never

2578.81 --> 2584.84
apologize that kind of thing then

2580.91 --> 2587.42
becomes extremely hard unless they

2584.84 --> 2590.28
really realize how important it is and

2587.42 --> 2593.28
manage to kind of break away from there

2590.28 --> 2597.3900000000003
standard behavior in it and switch to a

2593.28 --> 2600.8900000000003
real responsible dad mode but yeah not

2597.39 --> 2605.6099999999997
every dad has that you have to have the

2600.89 --> 2608.8199999999997
spark of that usually it it initiates

2605.61 --> 2613.1400000000003
after your first the kid is born but

2608.82 --> 2616.25
sometimes it doesn't and then you're

2613.14 --> 2619.44
kind of lost in a way it's weird

2616.25 --> 2625.53
my dad didn't have the spark but then he

2619.44 --> 2626.88
kind of disconnected it was icky he felt

2625.53 --> 2629.73
the connection but he couldn't do

2626.88 --> 2632.19
anything with it there was like a weird

2629.73 --> 2637.14
misunderstanding but that came again

2632.19 --> 2640.71
from his from his things that happen

2637.14 --> 2642.7799999999997
with his dad when he was very young so

2640.71 --> 2644.88
that got in the way it's very complex

2642.78 --> 2648.1200000000003
but it all resolved and we all talked

2644.88 --> 2651.36
about it first in arguments when the

2648.12 --> 2655.08
family was still together up to fighting

2651.36 --> 2656.79
levels and after the family broke up and

2655.08 --> 2658.68
everything then we just got to talk

2656.79 --> 2662.46
about it very calmly and peacefully and

2658.68 --> 2666.12
really resolve it and then it as the

2662.46 --> 2668.16
echoes from the past resolved the energy

2666.12 --> 2672.72
switched and suddenly things started

2668.16 --> 2675.5
working yeah that's how I've experienced

2672.72 --> 2681.12
the radical change in my dad's character

2675.5 --> 2682.92
radical change like real new energy that

2681.12 --> 2689.64
literally wasn't there before

2682.92 --> 2693.02
it's yeah he's very inspired was that

2689.64 --> 2698.87
like after he turned 50 or something no

2693.02 --> 2698.87
no no let's see

2701.25 --> 2711.82
well well maybe hold on

2706.26 --> 2713.5
yeah you know yeah but it did but it was

2711.82 --> 2717.25
pretty much also the time we're like

2713.5 --> 2719.74
right after my mother died so okay I

2717.25 --> 2722.2
assume that that had a huge impact as it

2719.74 --> 2724.93
did on me on everyone even though they

2722.2 --> 2729.27
were the village that's still just yeah

2724.93 --> 2729.27
they they were married for like 30 years

2729.84 --> 2740.83
yeah you know definitely people can get

2736.03 --> 2743.369
inspired from tragedy you know all right

2740.83 --> 2746.74
face if they take it the right way and

2743.369 --> 2748.57
but there was just so much wrong that

2746.74 --> 2750.8199999999997
couldn't get resolved between my dad and

2748.57 --> 2753.46
my mother it just couldn't fix it it

2750.82 --> 2756.28
would continue to clash or they see me

2753.46 --> 2758.83
didn't want to fix it they didn't want

2756.28 --> 2761.17
to adapt in a certain way and they

2758.83 --> 2762.73
couldn't and what it was it didn't work

2761.17 --> 2763.7400000000002
out eventually it just didn't work

2762.73 --> 2769.9
anymore

2763.74 --> 2775.2099999999996
they changed too much and yeah after my

2769.9 --> 2777.73
mother died then suddenly all that it's

2775.21 --> 2779.23
like a case that is always there as long

2777.73 --> 2781.51
as the other person is there and then

2779.23 --> 2784.21
when they're really young then you drop

2781.51 --> 2786.25
it you drop it permanently because you

2784.21 --> 2791.109
know you're never going to bump into

2786.25 --> 2795.31
them again see so let's not the culture

2791.109 --> 2798.7599999999998
is absolutely resolved after that and it

2795.31 --> 2802.33
did my dad really like was like wow what

2798.76 --> 2805.78
actually happened in half of my life and

2802.33 --> 2810.1
what am I gonna do now Who am I after

2805.78 --> 2815.8900000000003
all this and yeah you've really made

2810.1 --> 2819.359
work of it and an idea to help him and

2815.89 --> 2824.7599999999998
say you forgave your dad yeah yeah

2819.359 --> 2824.7599999999998
although it is it's not a resilient

2825.119 --> 2832.569
unconditional forgiveness that not that

2828.25 --> 2838.809
because if he would fall back

2832.569 --> 2840.819
and good then yeah then it's gonna be

2838.809 --> 2844.029
wrong again but as long as he's like

2840.819 --> 2848.679
this and it's like a sparring game he

2844.029 --> 2853.209
really stays great stays the path and so

2848.679 --> 2857.38
do i and we can't step away we would

2853.209 --> 2859.8089999999997
hurt each other like if I didn't do

2857.38 --> 2863.1890000000003
really do my best as I do and as I want

2859.809 --> 2869.9790000000003
to even for myself my dad would just be

2863.189 --> 2871.359
like shocked if I did that but I

2869.979 --> 2873.8489999999997
wouldn't even consider it and so it's

2871.359 --> 2875.699
just no logical reason whatsoever to do

2873.849 --> 2878.679
it I would just be giving everything out

2875.699 --> 2881.199
everything that I've made everything

2878.679 --> 2883.63
that I've built up would be as good as

2881.199 --> 2887.049
useless because all my methodology all

2883.63 --> 2889.3900000000003
comes from the path and it doesn't work

2887.049 --> 2890.949
when you stray away from the path so you

2889.39 --> 2893.1299999999997
literally lose everything it's like a

2890.949 --> 2900.039
paladin losing all of their skills

2893.13 --> 2901.239
because you stray yeah yep anyway hey

2900.039 --> 2906.699
you doing Chris what's happening man

2901.239 --> 2910.169
yeah Chris sorry for hey leave lower in

2906.699 --> 2910.169
the background how are you doing

2912.059 --> 2921.9390000000003
I heard some of you on the on Jose's you

2917.769 --> 2925.089
were doing pretty good there yeah it's I

2921.939 --> 2925.589
have a love-hate relationship everybody

2925.089 --> 2929.709
does

2925.589 --> 2932.169
yeah it's fun to go but you know you can

2929.709 --> 2937.5389999999998
only have so much rumpus and dr. Bob and

2932.169 --> 2938.6189999999997
Brenda well Spa the Science Guy all

2937.539 --> 2942.099
right it's dr. Bob

2938.619 --> 2944.9390000000003
oh I'm George George magic yeah it's

2942.099 --> 2948.9390000000003
mostly the hypocrisy that gets to me

2944.939 --> 2951.939
like they literally they constantly like

2948.939 --> 2954.219
the last time I came home I yeah rumpus

2951.939 --> 2957.459
was literally talking over me constantly

2954.219 --> 2959.559
like constantly then I kept silent for a

2957.459 --> 2962.319
while then I kind of interrupted

2959.559 --> 2964.63
somebody else and then a guy I didn't

2962.319 --> 2966.43
even know that was but he spent like two

2964.63 --> 2968.859
minutes berating me for

2966.43 --> 2975.04
daring to interrupt somebody else it's

2968.859 --> 2976.9
like dude seriously they're that kind of

2975.04 --> 2979.21
[ __ ] really gets to me that really makes

2976.9 --> 2989.65
me want to run up to them and kick them

2979.21 --> 2992.02
in the nuts full force right that's like

2989.65 --> 2993.369
code and I've I've been real childish I

2992.02 --> 2995.44
don't give a [ __ ] because they're the

2993.369 --> 2997.089
same way and they don't care you know

2995.44 --> 2998.079
they're as far as they know they're as

2997.089 --> 2999.94
far as we know they're trolling

2998.079 --> 3001.53
innocence that sure they might believe

2999.94 --> 3004.44
the earth is round but they're trolling

3001.53 --> 3005.6400000000003
us thinks you know they say things like

3004.44 --> 3006.809
well you don't really believe it you

3005.64 --> 3009.359
can't really believe it

3006.809 --> 3011.0400000000004
there's no way that it's true it's know

3009.359 --> 3012.27
that nothing works on the on a flat

3011.04 --> 3014.329
earth and all those kind of things and

3012.27 --> 3016.859
I'm like well they're playing devils

3014.329 --> 3019.819
they're constantly seducing you

3016.859 --> 3022.91
manipulating you pushing youth basically

3019.819 --> 3024.39
passive aggressively threatening you

3022.91 --> 3027.0
everything they can

3024.39 --> 3030.27
it's all manipulation and it's standard

3027.0 --> 3032.059
it's normalized it's normal to do that

3030.27 --> 3035.73
for them

3032.059 --> 3037.049
right but I've enjoyed it I see from me

3035.73 --> 3039.809
it's been actually more of a learning

3037.049 --> 3043.079
experience because I've learned how to

3039.809 --> 3046.2000000000003
make my arguments more sixteens and more

3043.079 --> 3047.88
clear and there's things that they're

3046.2 --> 3050.7
not presenting like rumpus will present

3047.88 --> 3052.29
stuff but I have full answers for on a

3050.7 --> 3055.049
flat earth like why things that's

3052.29 --> 3056.64
apparently disappear over curve why

3055.049 --> 3059.91
ships you know white ships and boats

3056.64 --> 3061.47
appear to drop over a curve you know all

3059.91 --> 3064.2599999999998
those kind of observations that they

3061.47 --> 3067.9199999999996
show Tim Osmonds observations of why

3064.26 --> 3070.23
building appears to be cut down I've

3067.92 --> 3075.51
really really gotten those down and I

3070.23 --> 3077.96
like talking about those cool so how how

3075.51 --> 3081.0
would you say what is causing the the

3077.96 --> 3083.01
concealment as I now know it not really

3081.0 --> 3084.78
obstruction because obstruction right

3083.01 --> 3086.9100000000003
and suggest literally something

3084.78 --> 3089.549
physically being in in between although

3086.91 --> 3093.0
at the coast that seems to be the case

3089.549 --> 3097.07
with the tidal bulge you've heard about

3093.0 --> 3100.859
that right from the title yeah

3097.07 --> 3102.9300000000003
titlebar what is it yeah tidal tidal

3100.859 --> 3106.0499999999997
bores one of them Borg yeah I call it

3102.93 --> 3110.49
bulge it is kind of a blouse I call it

3106.05 --> 3112.6800000000003
the tidal bulge well it kind of is right

3110.49 --> 3114.77
it's full it is bulging the water up for

3112.68 --> 3117.27
a short period or some period of time

3114.77 --> 3120.59
but locally it's not everywhere it's

3117.27 --> 3123.72
only in front so it's literally

3120.59 --> 3126.84
obstructing things behind it so that is

3123.72 --> 3128.31
obstruction right but it's a it's

3126.84 --> 3129.57
basically a wave right it's a wave

3128.31 --> 3130.5299999999997
that's obstructing in the near

3129.57 --> 3132.42
foreground and we know that's

3130.53 --> 3138.09
perspective um so that's that's

3132.42 --> 3141.599
explainable so one thing is a really key

3138.09 --> 3145.109
point is that rumpus is at least honest

3141.599 --> 3146.67
enough to admit that objects should be

3145.109 --> 3148.08
hidden over the curve but says they

3146.67 --> 3151.71
aren't due to what you call super

3148.08 --> 3154.14
looming right so if you look up super

3151.71 --> 3156.33
looming that doesn't exist he had to

3154.14 --> 3159.45
make something up to explain why we are

3156.33 --> 3160.31
seeing things too far all right fractal

3159.45 --> 3163.2
looming

3160.31 --> 3165.089
yeah fractal looming super looming

3163.2 --> 3167.8199999999997
it has to be fractal looming otherwise

3165.089 --> 3171.359
why would you see mirages in zones and

3167.82 --> 3174.2400000000002
reflections being part of the image that

3171.359 --> 3176.25
is being loomed up that's technically

3174.24 --> 3179.2999999999997
impossible so it would have to read the

3176.25 --> 3182.73
mysterious effect of fractal looming

3179.3 --> 3187.1090000000004
well reflections can be part of the

3182.73 --> 3189.66
entire mirage right but since that's

3187.109 --> 3191.79
technically not possible I don't even

3189.66 --> 3195.1189999999997
talk about it you're talking about like

3191.79 --> 3201.08
an inferior Mirage over a curve well you

3195.119 --> 3201.08
can't this you can't loom a reflection

3202.52 --> 3205.52
understand

3205.65 --> 3211.13
if there's like a reflection or

3208.109 --> 3215.4
something going on that cannot be

3211.13 --> 3219.42
visible in the displacement it just it's

3215.4 --> 3220.98
not possible it'll be cut out you'll see

3219.42 --> 3224.4
everything that is literally behind it

3220.98 --> 3228.029
instead you're saying if you're going

3224.4 --> 3230.279
over a curve no I'm saying that in case

3228.029 --> 3232.799
when there is literally a mirage an

3230.279 --> 3236.099
image in a location where it's not when

3232.799 --> 3239.849
it's a displaced the looming so in a

3236.099 --> 3243.509
looming image you can't see something

3239.849 --> 3248.099
that is like a reflection or a part of a

3243.509 --> 3253.349
mirage itself in the actual location it

3248.099 --> 3256.7400000000002
doesn't transport it it doesn't copy in

3253.349 --> 3257.9100000000003
looming effect so if that were literally

3256.74 --> 3261.5989999999997
the case then it would have to be

3257.91 --> 3266.8799999999997
fractal looming and that's yes science

3261.599 --> 3270.029
fiction it's science fiction I made it

3266.88 --> 3271.859
up it wasn't joke oh no but but it is

3270.029 --> 3273.42
kind of a serious joke because that is

3271.859 --> 3275.819
what would be required in order to

3273.42 --> 3279.48
explain the things that they see as a

3275.819 --> 3284.22
mirage or as looming it's just well look

3279.48 --> 3286.14
I I've seen videos of people doing tests

3284.22 --> 3288.569
where they'll put like dope or really

3286.14 --> 3292.109
cold ice water or some really cold

3288.569 --> 3294.39
liquid on on a surface and it it appears

3292.109 --> 3296.64
to lift and look light up to where you

3294.39 --> 3300.0589999999997
can see something you couldn't see

3296.64 --> 3301.799
before the problem with that is there's

3300.059 --> 3303.809
two things one the extreme conditions

3301.799 --> 3306.45
you have to do to get that effect like

3303.809 --> 3307.92
pouring ice water over something right

3306.45 --> 3310.6499999999996
that doesn't happen in nature and then

3307.92 --> 3312.9300000000003
to even when they do those extreme

3310.65 --> 3315.2690000000002
conditions they four they're getting I'm

3312.93 --> 3319.14
gonna be conservative and say about two

3315.269 --> 3322.0089999999996
inches of lift okay but what we're told

3319.14 --> 3325.41
is that you can get a hundred feet of

3322.009 --> 3327.92
looming lift for some for like a boat or

3325.41 --> 3330.299
a building that's over the curve well

3327.92 --> 3332.579
how are you going to go from an extreme

3330.299 --> 3334.859
extreme example where you're pouring

3332.579 --> 3338.13
coal you know freezing cold ice water to

3334.859 --> 3340.2
get to inches but that's not even in the

3338.13 --> 3342.4500000000003
fear right the temperature variation the

3340.2 --> 3344.3089999999997
atmosphere is that extreme but when you

3342.45 --> 3345.93
look at through at a distance and

3344.309 --> 3349.4700000000003
through the adjusting temperature by the

3345.93 --> 3350.6699999999996
way it's also the actual density right

3349.47 --> 3353.99
well the temperature is called the

3350.67 --> 3356.849
temperature is what is causing change

3353.99 --> 3358.1699999999996
but in normal atmospheric conditions

3356.849 --> 3359.849
what are you talking about that say the

3358.17 --> 3362.609
difference between the air and the water

3359.849 --> 3364.289
temperatures why 20 degrees 25 degrees

3362.609 --> 3367.5
what's the difference between these

3364.289 --> 3368.6090000000004
tests like 50 degrees 70 degrees and

3367.5 --> 3371.009
even then they're like I say they're

3368.609 --> 3374.549
getting about two inches of blue what

3371.009 --> 3376.65
I'd call blooming or lift but it's just

3374.549 --> 3378.75
not it just doesn't work how do you get

3376.65 --> 3381.809
a hundred feet of looming right that

3378.75 --> 3383.91
doesn't just not adding up but it's not

3381.809 --> 3386.009
how they apply it look I figured out

3383.91 --> 3389.24
that trick it's literally a trick what

3386.009 --> 3392.73
they do and that is if something is

3389.24 --> 3394.8289999999997
concealed they say look it's curvature

3392.73 --> 3398.91
it's being obstructed by the curvature

3394.829 --> 3401.73
but once you get some kind of view where

3398.91 --> 3404.1299999999997
for example you literally look directly

3401.73 --> 3407.099
over the ocean and suddenly you see the

3404.13 --> 3410.25
beach miles away on the other side then

3407.099 --> 3413.4500000000003
they say oh well it's lousy curvature so

3410.25 --> 3416.849
it must be looming right literally

3413.45 --> 3419.22
discrete question if there's if there is

3416.849 --> 3423.17
obstruction its curvature if there's no

3419.22 --> 3426.089
obstruction it's looming it's not even

3423.17 --> 3427.829
that they literally puzzle out how it's

3426.089 --> 3429.9
supposed to be it's just the way they

3427.829 --> 3433.289
respond they can go either way

3429.9 --> 3435.809
either it's timing or its curvature it

3433.289 --> 3438.8390000000004
doesn't match because shouldn't be able

3435.809 --> 3441.9
to be both at the same time but they do

3438.839 --> 3444.3289999999997
it anyway Casey okay yes that's a good

3441.9 --> 3446.63
point I got a drop the elevator all

3444.329 --> 3452.4900000000002
right I'm gonna run out the show anyway

3446.63 --> 3455.19
sinkers right it was a good talk so yeah

3452.49 --> 3457.14
thanks Ionia dude yeah yeah I'm gonna

3455.19 --> 3459.089
run out the show thanks for coming and

3457.14 --> 3460.95
discussing some things the studio and

3459.089 --> 3465.18
Chris very great conversation some

3460.95 --> 3466.54
actual flat earth content it's good so

3465.18 --> 3468.7599999999998
yeah

3466.54 --> 3473.32
thanks everyone in chat for coming it's

3468.76 --> 3476.2900000000004
been interesting even some halfway

3473.32 --> 3479.9500000000003
decent questions from cyma and an you

3476.29 --> 3483.19
know maybe an ass but as long as these

3479.95 --> 3485.9199999999996
good questions is always something that

3483.19 --> 3491.9500000000003
I can appreciate no matter from who it

3485.92 --> 3496.63
is coming so yeah yes

time and also please please sometimes

3514.66 --> 3519.1299999999997
hit the superjet haven't seen anything

3518.08 --> 3524.11
in two days

3519.13 --> 3526.48
Moo oh well I'm still doing fine and

3524.11 --> 3529.1800000000003

and become part of my patreon I still

3529.18 --> 3533.02
have only 1 subscriber in patreon would

3531.1 --> 3536.98
be really nice to see somebody else join

3533.02 --> 3539.89
in there just to get things rolling I am

3536.98 --> 3541.9
gonna do things you know if you give me

3539.89 --> 3544.15
the opportunity literally which comes

3541.9 --> 3550.4500000000003
through money at this moment because

3544.15 --> 3552.64
time I got plenty so yeah that goes for

3550.45 --> 3555.99
the support I will be back tomorrow a

3552.64 --> 3559.12
flattered the early bird number 171 and

3555.99 --> 3562.8399999999997
I'm gonna probably join the debates

3559.12 --> 3567.0099999999998
right after this there is any is there

3562.84 --> 3570.7000000000003
any yeah Nathan has already put up links

3567.01 --> 3574.0600000000004
so there should be the debates so do

3570.7 --> 3577.72
watch that and yeah back tomorrow Flat

3574.06 --> 3581.35
Earth early bird in 171 so until the

3577.72 --> 3584.56
next time hashtag meifa of course haha

3581.35 --> 3587.68
no it was first no damn a were moco was

3584.56 --> 3590.83
way way ahead of me

3587.68 --> 3592.87
okay so hashtag me if I make earth flat

3590.83 --> 3597.75
again and until the next letter

3592.87 --> 3597.75
early-bird tomorrow keep it flat

3597.91 --> 3629.0699999999997
