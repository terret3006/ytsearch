84.84 --> 90.88000000000001
so today

87.6 --> 93.119
it started out kind of really nice

90.88 --> 95.6
but now there's some big clouds rolling

93.119 --> 95.6
in so

95.92 --> 102.479
might get rainy again look at how dark

99.28 --> 102.479
that cloud is over there

104.079 --> 111.119
see that like dark bluish but that's

107.36 --> 115.439
not blue that's actually cloud

111.119 --> 118.24
right there it's really dark

115.439 --> 118.24
over there as well

126.84 --> 132.959
right so

130.319 --> 133.83999999999997
hello that flat fellow first in chat

132.959 --> 138.239
clutch bear

133.84 --> 141.28
good to see you all right

138.239 --> 145.59900000000002
so it is tuesday the

141.28 --> 145.599
3rd of august 2021

146.4 --> 152.87900000000002
and yeah i don't know

150.319 --> 155.04
what kind of show it's going to be today

152.879 --> 156.79999999999998
originally actually planned to skip this

155.04 --> 158.72
show

156.8 --> 160.08
not without reason because yesterday

158.72 --> 164.0
night i got

160.08 --> 168.0
very very sick and

164.0 --> 171.04
like comparable to last year october

168.0 --> 174.56
except yeah this time

171.04 --> 177.76
alcohol was not involved whatsoever

174.56 --> 180.239
no but i did get sick it was pretty

177.76 --> 180.239
bizarre

180.64 --> 187.67999999999998
in no sick not drunk

184.239 --> 187.68
no that was like

187.76 --> 194.159
how much like

191.2 --> 194.879
five or six hours after i had my last

194.159 --> 199.67999999999998
beer

194.879 --> 204.0
right so it's not alcohol absolutely not

199.68 --> 204.0
no it was tension it was pure tension

206.239 --> 212.64000000000001
i was glad i was able to call my healer

209.36 --> 214.08
despite him being on vacation this

212.64 --> 217.11999999999998
morning

214.08 --> 217.12
and that did help

217.519 --> 220.72
have i ever missed the show yes yes i

220.0 --> 226.48
have before

220.72 --> 229.519
flat fellow but yeah especially now that

226.48 --> 234.79899999999998
reaching the thousand i just

229.519 --> 239.28
i'm having really big trouble even just

234.799 --> 239.28
stepping away from the everyday thing

239.36 --> 243.20000000000002
next time no it's not funny now getting

242.64 --> 247.2
sick

243.2 --> 247.599
from being drunk like i did last year is

247.2 --> 251.35999999999999
not

247.599 --> 252.879
freaking funny it was hell

251.36 --> 255.84
don't know why you would say such a

252.879 --> 255.84
thing

256.799 --> 260.32
drunken bullet four one one

262.16 --> 269.12
right so i'm still basically

265.919 --> 272.79999999999995
partially recovering from that standing

269.12 --> 272.8
positive vibes i appreciate that

273.199 --> 278.639
it was weird because

276.32 --> 280.479
i was just trying to go to bed doing

278.639 --> 283.44
what i do normally

280.479 --> 284.639
and this tension inside of me that was

283.44 --> 288.71999999999997
well typically

284.639 --> 291.12
piles up in certain locations or organs

288.72 --> 293.6
and then have an influence i couldn't

291.12 --> 296.16
get away from it

293.6 --> 298.08000000000004
and then eventually i started to

296.16 --> 300.47900000000004
overload

298.08 --> 302.71999999999997
like even describing it now is is a

300.479 --> 303.59999999999997
minor risk because i don't want it back

302.72 --> 307.03900000000004
right

303.6 --> 310.32000000000005
normally when i flip like this

307.039 --> 312.96
my systems flips it's like

310.32 --> 316.15999999999997
comparable to a nervous breakdown except

312.96 --> 319.68
without the psychosis

316.16 --> 323.03900000000004
right normally it has a

319.68 --> 326.72
huge impact on my organs and it lasts

323.039 --> 329.84
very long so i'm still a bit

326.72 --> 331.6
feeble but

329.84 --> 333.52
i did get it under control yesterday

331.6 --> 335.84000000000003
night so

333.52 --> 339.84
but yeah not before like throwing up in

335.84 --> 339.84
the shower and [ __ ]

341.36 --> 345.68
maybe though maybe it was partially food

344.32 --> 350.84
poison it it's just

345.68 --> 353.84000000000003
i'm not entirely sure like i'm certainly

350.84 --> 353.84
gonna

354.24 --> 360.72
make sure right but i'm gonna take it

358.4 --> 363.28
easy today i need to

360.72 --> 365.03900000000004
because when i'm like this and it's not

363.28 --> 367.039
as bad as it was yesterday because when

365.039 --> 370.15999999999997
it's high tension it's much worse

367.039 --> 372.8
i get a lot of weird side effects

370.16 --> 375.12
mainly that if i start to dwell with my

372.8 --> 380.0
mind on something

375.12 --> 382.24
sadly i can't compartmentalize it

380.0 --> 383.759
anymore so whatever i think about and

382.24 --> 386.8
feel about

383.759 --> 387.52000000000004
that becomes me it's really bizarre

386.8 --> 391.36
experience

387.52 --> 394.639
very scary right it's it feels like

391.36 --> 396.88
you literally have no

394.639 --> 399.28000000000003
grip on who you are anymore when that

396.88 --> 399.28
happens

399.52 --> 403.19899999999996
now what you are still stays what you

402.479 --> 405.75899999999996
are it's just

403.199 --> 406.639
in that moment yet you seem to be losing

405.759 --> 408.40000000000003
grip

406.639 --> 409.759
right a lot of people will probably go

408.4 --> 412.08
full-on psychotic

409.759 --> 413.52000000000004
if they experience this i've been

412.08 --> 417.68
through it a lot

413.52 --> 423.84
in my life i know how to identify it i

417.68 --> 423.84000000000003
know how to deal with it

426.08 --> 432.88
so yeah pj krishan

429.599 --> 435.52
i am not as good as i was yes well i

432.88 --> 436.4
technically in a way i am better i feel

435.52 --> 439.84
much more

436.4 --> 439.84
cleaned up because

441.199 --> 446.08000000000004
like the stress of everything was had

443.599 --> 449.28
been piling up for a while

446.08 --> 453.19899999999996
and then financial stress world

449.28 --> 453.19899999999996
psychological warfare stress

454.479 --> 464.08
my platform operations

458.8 --> 468.16
stress relevancy stress right all that

464.08 --> 468.15999999999997
ah talking about it is making me nervous

470.96 --> 474.96
hey mitchell from australia good to see

476.84 --> 479.84
you

484.479 --> 490.84
all right so is it an anxiety attack

488.24 --> 496.24
very comparable to a tony whitcomb

490.84 --> 496.23999999999995
except it stays for a very long time

496.72 --> 507.68
usually a full day at least

500.72 --> 511.36
but i managed to dislocate

507.68 --> 512.88
the overburdening effect on my organs

511.36 --> 515.6800000000001
from my mind a little but i have to be

512.88 --> 521.8389999999999
careful right

515.68 --> 521.8389999999999
oh [ __ ]

528.56 --> 533.1999999999999
right so technically what's happened

530.56 --> 536.56
i've been overstressing myself

533.2 --> 538.88
the way yesterday show ended

536.56 --> 540.56
probably hinted at it already for a lot

538.88 --> 542.32
of you that have seen it

540.56 --> 544.3199999999999
because i'm really i was really

542.32 --> 546.399
stressing out

544.32 --> 549.9200000000001
in a way i still am financially it's

546.399 --> 553.6
just that i didn't want to deal

549.92 --> 553.5999999999999
with going through another

553.839 --> 558.32
change in how i do things on a daily

556.959 --> 560.8389999999999
basis because i think

558.32 --> 562.24
things have been going really well and

560.839 --> 566.08
stable

562.24 --> 569.44
but it's partially under strain

566.08 --> 571.279
and that's been working because i didn't

569.44 --> 573.519
have to pile on stress about my

571.279 --> 577.36
financial situation anymore

573.519 --> 580.64
but since that started to loom back

577.36 --> 583.279
i had hoped for a quick solution

580.64 --> 585.36
that didn't happen then i snapped

583.279 --> 591.8389999999999
because of it pretty much

585.36 --> 591.839
and that's been wearing on me yesterday

600.22 --> 607.76
[Music]

603.36 --> 607.76
see we do you all like this enough

607.839 --> 612.32
now there's no external thing you can

610.079 --> 619.8389999999999
take to solve this

612.32 --> 619.839
this is an internal management issue

630.88 --> 637.36
right yeah return to normal

634.8 --> 638.3199999999999
and everybody like don't worry too much

637.36 --> 640.24
about this right

638.32 --> 643.279
those who have followed me for a long

640.24 --> 645.2
time i've seen this before

643.279 --> 648.8
i'll be all right it's just that when

645.2 --> 648.8000000000001
you go through it everything

650.0 --> 652.56
becomes

656.32 --> 661.839
experienced by me

659.6 --> 663.36
like it's too much like even little

661.839 --> 666.0
things

663.36 --> 668.24
it's like super oversensitivity that is

666.0 --> 669.8
highly unreasonable

668.24 --> 672.64
and as i said before it can't

669.8 --> 675.279
compartmentalize it

672.64 --> 675.76
so the over sensitivity really starts to

675.279 --> 679.36
show

675.76 --> 679.36
when i am in this mode

684.56 --> 691.1199999999999
but i'm doing okay it's all fine

688.959 --> 692.4799999999999
it's not going to be particularly

691.12 --> 694.399
interesting show

692.48 --> 698.399
and that's why i also i didn't even i

694.399 --> 698.399
discontinued the title card thing

698.64 --> 702.079
it might get i might get new inspiration

701.36 --> 704.0
back right i

702.079 --> 705.92
have considered like maybe i should

704.0 --> 710.8
somehow like literally

705.92 --> 713.8389999999999
take a vacation from doing this except

710.8 --> 714.639
i will have to then i can't just take it

713.839 --> 718.1600000000001
away and

714.639 --> 721.2
have very little to replace it with

718.16 --> 721.76
in daily activity right it's not that

721.2 --> 724.32
like i'm

721.76 --> 726.56
so much devastated like i really have to

724.32 --> 727.7600000000001
physically recover and just sleep and be

726.56 --> 731.8389999999999
sick all day because

727.76 --> 731.8389999999999
it's not like that

733.6 --> 737.9200000000001
to take deep breaths oh my god yeah tony

735.839 --> 739.2
whitcomb i have done that a lot

737.92 --> 741.36
yesterday

739.2 --> 742.5600000000001
i pretty much did non-stop breathing

741.36 --> 745.279
exercises

742.56 --> 747.04
like i would do breathing exercises

745.279 --> 749.2
yesterday

747.04 --> 750.88
as i was falling asleep and i would

749.2 --> 753.2
actively keep myself

750.88 --> 755.2
awake with it because i could not allow

753.2 --> 758.48
the sleep switch

755.2 --> 760.5600000000001
before the stress situation

758.48 --> 762.639
would have been stable enough to allow

760.56 --> 764.16
that because otherwise i'd probably

762.639 --> 767.44
start dreaming and then

764.16 --> 768.24
suddenly wake up from that dream very

767.44 --> 770.48
nastily with

768.24 --> 772.32
extreme sickness right and if that would

770.48 --> 773.2
have happened then i might have gotten

772.32 --> 776.32
caught into

773.2 --> 780.5600000000001
like a bad long cycle where it just

776.32 --> 787.839
refuses to stop so it was like

780.56 --> 787.8389999999999
spirit warfare with my own mechanisms

790.24 --> 794.16
and i got through it i survived

794.959 --> 800.959
but every time that happens every time

797.76 --> 804.88
that happens it feels like

800.959 --> 807.1999999999999
is this it is it feels like

804.88 --> 809.6
death is knocking on your door it's like

807.2 --> 809.6
yeah

810.24 --> 813.92
just a few more steps and you die that's

813.36 --> 818.0
what it

813.92 --> 818.0
feels like it's very surreal

820.56 --> 825.8389999999999
you can't reason it out

824.16 --> 828.639
when you're like that with yourself you

825.839 --> 831.9200000000001
can't relativate

828.639 --> 836.24
the experience like normal so you just

831.92 --> 836.24
have to constantly distract yourself

836.48 --> 842.0
and make sure that you don't roll into

839.44 --> 845.2790000000001
some deeper thought that will completely

842.0 --> 847.92
absorb you because when you do that then

845.279 --> 850.079
you lose the conscious focus needed to

847.92 --> 854.639
keep yourself stable it's freaky

850.079 --> 854.6389999999999
in a way yeah arwin oh arwin is so

854.839 --> 857.839
whatever

858.88 --> 862.72
i don't even know what to think about it

861.68 --> 864.959
i'm just being

862.72 --> 866.24
insanely honest here and just whatever

864.959 --> 868.4799999999999
you know it's not like

866.24 --> 870.0
this sort of weakness is like oh my god

868.48 --> 874.48
if i tell this to people

870.0 --> 876.32
then i risk no

874.48 --> 878.0
like i have it under control this has

876.32 --> 881.12
been a thing that's been with me

878.0 --> 883.6
on my entire life so

881.12 --> 884.88
i've only gotten better at dealing with

883.6 --> 886.5600000000001
it

884.88 --> 889.6
right when i was much younger i thought

886.56 --> 891.4399999999999
like yeah i am gonna die one day in this

889.6 --> 893.0400000000001
like literally gonna come false and then

891.44 --> 894.1600000000001
fall over with a heart attack or

893.04 --> 897.4399999999999
something

894.16 --> 899.04
well the older i get the more the less

897.44 --> 904.1600000000001
likely

899.04 --> 904.16
that outcomes outcome seems to be

904.399 --> 907.68
also because i recognize now that

906.639 --> 911.12
sensation

907.68 --> 912.959
during it is a lie

911.12 --> 914.16
it feels the end is right in front of

912.959 --> 918.399
you it's a lie

914.16 --> 920.959
it's probably a lie comfort referencing

918.399 --> 922.16
the levels of stress and all that

920.959 --> 926.7199999999999
comparing it to

922.16 --> 930.0
previous cycles it's actually less

926.72 --> 933.12
so that sensation that it will

930.0 --> 936.079
now end is just

933.12 --> 938.079
practically wrong based on reflections

936.079 --> 940.16
of past experiences

938.079 --> 942.079
and i know that now i can trust that

940.16 --> 946.3199999999999
intellectually

942.079 --> 946.6389999999999
that it is like in such a situation it

946.32 --> 949.9200000000001
is

946.639 --> 952.0790000000001
as if there is like a friend

949.92 --> 954.079
or whatever somebody you know that's

952.079 --> 956.399
nagging on your head when you're really

954.079 --> 958.16
weak about something you know is

956.399 --> 960.48
[ __ ] but you're like you feel too

958.16 --> 964.88
weak to tell them off

960.48 --> 968.72
right except it's inside of you

964.88 --> 970.959
now i know because of wisdom because of

968.72 --> 973.12
reflections of past situations where i'd

970.959 --> 977.5189999999999
have the same sensation i know now

973.12 --> 977.759
that's [ __ ] doesn't matter how alone

977.519 --> 980.639
i

977.759 --> 983.839
am how torturous the experience might be

980.639 --> 985.6
in a certain moment i'm not afraid

983.839 --> 989.36
even though there's this weird sense in

985.6 --> 993.519
me telling telling me to be

989.36 --> 997.839
right so we anxiety

993.519 --> 997.839
blah metabolic cycles

998.56 --> 1003.199
my yeah my uh

1003.44 --> 1007.36
my organ certainly got a big heavy

1006.0 --> 1009.199
massage let's just say

1007.36 --> 1011.839
like that and there's an advantage to

1009.199 --> 1011.8389999999999
that

1019.839 --> 1023.839
what are you talking about hey steamy

1021.519 --> 1024.959
traveler good long walk in fresh air

1023.839 --> 1027.76
always helps

1024.959 --> 1029.6000000000001
well it doesn't help when you're like

1027.76 --> 1034.24
really tired

1029.6 --> 1034.24
shaking and like when you

1034.72 --> 1041.1200000000001
like i got like weird fever

1038.079 --> 1042.959
rolls but it wasn't because of a typical

1041.12 --> 1044.7199999999998
sickness cycle with like something that

1042.959 --> 1047.039
had to be fevered out it was no

1044.72 --> 1049.679
inflammation anywhere

1047.039 --> 1053.84
like not like that it was purely

1049.679 --> 1053.8400000000001
spiritual stress-based

1054.08 --> 1057.9189999999999
and i could not

1058.24 --> 1064.32
maintain like physical stability

1061.44 --> 1064.64
in order to take a walk outside and do

1064.32 --> 1066.6399999999999
that

1064.64 --> 1068.0800000000002
at the time because it was too much

1066.64 --> 1070.3200000000002
right now in

1068.08 --> 1072.32
post stage in a more recoverable period

1070.32 --> 1074.1599999999999
yeah walking outside is great

1072.32 --> 1075.6
dude even standing outside on the

1074.16 --> 1078.48
balcony is right now

1075.6 --> 1080.8799999999999
just great right after something like

1078.48 --> 1083.84
that happened it is like

1080.88 --> 1084.16
your senses are swept clean a bit so i

1083.84 --> 1087.28
do

1084.16 --> 1090.72
now feel and see and smell and

1087.28 --> 1095.039
sense more yes

1090.72 --> 1097.84
so yeah taking a walk in the park sounds

1095.039 --> 1098.799
like a great idea don't know for sure if

1097.84 --> 1104.72
i'm gonna do it

1098.799 --> 1104.72
today but it is an appealing idea

1106.24 --> 1112.72
when my ex got jab juice fire yes i

1108.72 --> 1112.72
totally get that slow mo moon buggy

1112.799 --> 1115.9189999999999
i totally get that

1121.52 --> 1128.0
yeah you don't want to panic

1124.799 --> 1130.32
right but then you lock it in

1128.0 --> 1131.84
and then eventually it will like avenge

1130.32 --> 1134.72
itself because you have

1131.84 --> 1137.76
you did still experience it and you had

1134.72 --> 1140.4
to hold it back right it's

1137.76 --> 1140.4
it's tough

1142.559 --> 1144.799
right

1149.2 --> 1153.6000000000001
it's almost like a wartime experience

1152.08 --> 1157.4399999999998
and it's like people

1153.6 --> 1160.6399999999999
like your fellow your brother soldiers

1157.44 --> 1163.919
like they get a wound

1160.64 --> 1167.44
and like you look take a look at

1163.919 --> 1169.2800000000002
it you know it's gonna have miserable

1167.44 --> 1173.6000000000001
consequences and you just

1169.28 --> 1175.6789999999999
can't bear to tell them they they can't

1173.6 --> 1177.6789999999999
handle that they would never be able to

1175.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
handle that in the situation

1177.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
right it's kind of like that terrible

1197.36 --> 1202.7199999999998
right by the way guys i personally feel

1200.96 --> 1205.679
a little guilty for being so

1202.72 --> 1206.0
for ending the show yesterday so angry

1205.679 --> 1209.2800000000002
because

1206.0 --> 1211.6
there's been really great people in chat

1209.28 --> 1213.84
like i have so many people in chat right

1211.6 --> 1213.84
now

1214.159 --> 1222.5590000000002
that are just awesome like compared to

1218.0 --> 1222.559
a year ago where i had maybe

1222.64 --> 1227.039
half of an amount of people that were

1226.159 --> 1230.48
pretty awesome

1227.039 --> 1231.6
and now i have double that like slo-mo

1230.48 --> 1234.96
moon buggy

1231.6 --> 1237.4399999999998

1274.64 --> 1278.159
yeah you've supported me before

1278.72 --> 1284.4
right sometimes the panic just makes me

1281.679 --> 1286.799
want to like help

1284.4 --> 1290.0
like please it's almost i feel like i

1286.799 --> 1291.9189999999999
have to rob you to survive

1290.0 --> 1294.96
it's what it felt like yesterday it's a

1291.919 --> 1298.0
terrible sensation because you guys are

1294.96 --> 1298.0
actually great

1298.799 --> 1302.72
i feel like i have to shake you down

1301.039 --> 1304.08
almost even though that's not really

1302.72 --> 1306.24
happening of course

1304.08 --> 1308.6399999999999
but it feels like it and i feel like you

1306.24 --> 1312.559
guys don't actually deserve that

1308.64 --> 1314.88
so i must be the faulty part party here

1312.559 --> 1316.48
wow thank you by the way drunken bullet

1314.88 --> 1318.0800000000002

1316.48 --> 1321.52
pretty big paypal donation

1318.08 --> 1325.28
that will absolutely help me for

1321.52 --> 1329.44
yeah for a few days at least great man i

1325.28 --> 1329.44
really really appreciate that's like

1330.799 --> 1335.9189999999999
thank you so much man i really needed

1333.679 --> 1335.919
that

1340.559 --> 1347.84
shake down money

1348.08 --> 1354.96
yeah hello moonshadow

1352.4 --> 1354.96
cleary

1356.48 --> 1361.039
is everybody else's police going over

1358.4 --> 1375.8400000000001
the top well not so much here i think

1361.039 --> 1375.84
not seeing it

1377.52 --> 1389.84
right so anyway

1391.919 --> 1395.919
yeah pj christian your drunken bullet is

1394.32 --> 1399.28
awesome and he's been around

1395.919 --> 1399.2800000000002
my show for a long time

1400.159 --> 1405.0390000000002
like i think he's been following me and

1402.32 --> 1407.2
it participating in chat for

1405.039 --> 1409.44
like at least one and a half year maybe

1407.2 --> 1409.44
two

1409.52 --> 1413.44
he's one of the older guard that's still

1411.6 --> 1416.559
around

1413.44 --> 1420.0
like even from before

1416.559 --> 1420.0
a good servant came around

1421.44 --> 1424.48
no snowbirds

1426.08 --> 1432.8799999999999
plant identifier app huh

1430.08 --> 1432.8799999999999
that's interesting

1437.52 --> 1441.679
that's actually a pretty good idea to

1439.679 --> 1444.72
have an app for that

1441.679 --> 1447.76
comparing to having to look it up in

1444.72 --> 1451.2
like 20 years ago

1447.76 --> 1452.48
in a book with like not even photographs

1451.2 --> 1455.76
necessarily but just

1452.48 --> 1455.76
like paintings

1456.0 --> 1463.12
so having an app if it actually works

1459.44 --> 1463.1200000000001
sounds like a pretty good idea

1470.84 --> 1473.84
right

1484.84 --> 1487.84
up

1488.159 --> 1490.5590000000002
i know

1494.559 --> 1498.08
and dude it's been a blast to have you

1496.24 --> 1500.64
around drunk and vote for one you get a

1498.08 --> 1503.279
little silly sometimes

1500.64 --> 1505.919
but you i've never seen you like really

1503.279 --> 1508.08
go dark and not quickly correct yourself

1505.919 --> 1515.8400000000001
like it's be it's been a joy to have you

1508.08 --> 1515.84
around drunken bullet forever one

1516.88 --> 1523.8400000000001
benefits dude pj krishan

1520.4 --> 1526.0
dude you just came by man i i really

1523.84 --> 1528.3999999999999
appreciate the sentiment that

1526.0 --> 1530.24
if look if you're on benefits then of

1528.4 --> 1533.679
course dude

1530.24 --> 1535.679
you know your own food comes first

1533.679 --> 1538.0
let's just get those priorities straight

1535.679 --> 1541.2
okay i like to eat

1538.0 --> 1544.799
but i don't like to literally take

1541.2 --> 1547.279
the food out of your mouth like that

1544.799 --> 1549.6
so yeah take care of yourself first of

1547.279 --> 1549.6
course

1551.84 --> 1557.84
i really appreciate the sentiment though

1571.36 --> 1573.6789999999999
right

1575.2 --> 1578.32
anyway dude i've been having so many

1577.6 --> 1580.9599999999998
busi

1578.32 --> 1582.48
like i'm having a sort of a weird format

1580.96 --> 1584.96
issue

1582.48 --> 1586.88
with everything that i do because i

1584.96 --> 1588.159
noticed there's a distinct difference to

1586.88 --> 1591.279
when i'm active in

1588.159 --> 1594.0
chats on other shows

1591.279 --> 1595.279
i seem to have a much wider range of

1594.0 --> 1598.64
creative

1595.279 --> 1601.52
wordplay available to me that somehow

1598.64 --> 1601.5200000000002
doesn't work

1602.159 --> 1605.3600000000001
when i'm like face to face on camera

1604.96 --> 1608.4
it's

1605.36 --> 1610.24
very bizarre like maybe it has to do

1608.4 --> 1613.039
with

1610.24 --> 1613.6
that it is like little retracted right

1613.039 --> 1616.0
it is

1613.6 --> 1617.039
just a chat it's different it's a

1616.0 --> 1620.4
different

1617.039 --> 1620.4
level of communication

1622.159 --> 1626.0
and i just noticed a lot of the times

1624.96 --> 1628.24
there's things that i

1626.0 --> 1629.679
say in chats that are like really great

1628.24 --> 1632.88
to me

1629.679 --> 1635.919
i'm very amused

1632.88 --> 1639.6000000000001
but then i forget about it

1635.919 --> 1642.48
or it just doesn't fit like it did

1639.6 --> 1643.039
if i want to like roll it out on my show

1642.48 --> 1654.08
it's

1643.039 --> 1656.96
it's weird

1654.08 --> 1659.36
i'm great i appreciate it man thank you

1656.96 --> 1663.44
i really appreciate the compliment

1659.36 --> 1665.279
i do my best it's not always great i

1663.44 --> 1667.3600000000001
know it isn't

1665.279 --> 1668.64
and i'm like very jealous of other

1667.36 --> 1671.039
people that just

1668.64 --> 1671.039
managed

1673.279 --> 1677.679
now of course they're in different

1676.159 --> 1683.8400000000001
situations because

1677.679 --> 1683.8400000000001
daily show every day

1688.08 --> 1692.1589999999999
so maybe that is it right maybe i should

1691.44 --> 1694.0800000000002
take

1692.159 --> 1695.5200000000002
i'd like to change the format for the

1694.08 --> 1698.1589999999999
show and do what

1695.52 --> 1699.12
almost everybody else seems to be doing

1698.159 --> 1701.7600000000002
taking off

1699.12 --> 1701.76
in the weekend

1702.64 --> 1706.3200000000002
it's just that i had kind of made up my

1704.96 --> 1709.52
mind to be

1706.32 --> 1711.279
that exception where everybody else

1709.52 --> 1715.279
would always take the holiday

1711.279 --> 1715.279
right every week

1715.919 --> 1725.8400000000001
hello jason brown

1734.559 --> 1741.039
right so i don't know for sure like

1739.36 --> 1743.84
if this is what i'm going through i'm

1741.039 --> 1745.6
still a little feeble not super feeble

1743.84 --> 1747.36
and that's what makes me walk around all

1745.6 --> 1749.1999999999998
of a sudden it's the tension i need to

1747.36 --> 1752.6399999999999
quickly walk it off or suddenly

1749.2 --> 1755.8400000000001
i'll snap back into a bad cycle

1752.64 --> 1757.8400000000001
right i don't know how long

1755.84 --> 1759.1999999999998
it will actually take before that goes

1757.84 --> 1762.799
away i hope

1759.2 --> 1762.799
that it's going to be gone this day

1763.2 --> 1766.32
and that tomorrow it'll be completely

1765.2 --> 1769.039
gone but i don't know

1766.32 --> 1769.039
so maybe

1774.559 --> 1781.84
we will still watch everyone need some i

1776.399 --> 1781.84
know i know you will

1792.84 --> 1795.84
hmm

1805.6 --> 1810.24
alright also there's this one weird

1808.48 --> 1811.2
experience i've been holding back a

1810.24 --> 1812.96
little

1811.2 --> 1815.039
kind of hesitant to address it it's

1812.96 --> 1818.24
personal it is personal

1815.039 --> 1820.399
but yeah another day

1818.24 --> 1820.3990000000001
i

1821.6 --> 1826.08
like went to a new store somewhere or

1825.039 --> 1828.559
it's not really new

1826.08 --> 1830.559
but i rarely go there so i was looking

1828.559 --> 1834.799
for something specific that my main

1830.559 --> 1834.799
grocery store doesn't have for some

1834.84 --> 1839.1999999999998
reason

1836.64 --> 1839.76
and there was a girl behind the counter

1839.2 --> 1842.799
and she

1839.76 --> 1846.72
got like this really

1842.799 --> 1846.72
visceral response from me

1846.96 --> 1850.0
like because i was at the time like

1849.6 --> 1852.08
really

1850.0 --> 1854.08
crushing it very strong i was very

1852.08 --> 1854.48
confident and i was radiating that and

1854.08 --> 1857.84
she

1854.48 --> 1860.24
like never seen it before or not that i

1857.84 --> 1864.0
remember maybe once before

1860.24 --> 1867.6
pretty palpable response to it

1864.0 --> 1870.48
not like trying to control it and it's

1867.6 --> 1870.48
just like wow

1876.0 --> 1881.12
i don't know

1879.2 --> 1884.0800000000002
makes me feel like i'm not out of the

1881.12 --> 1884.08
race just yet

1886.399 --> 1888.9599999999998
who knows

1891.12 --> 1895.5189999999998
it might just be like the first response

1893.36 --> 1895.519
like

1898.559 --> 1905.76
the way that i look might be my mustache

1903.44 --> 1908.24
or that i just have these big brown eyes

1905.76 --> 1909.039
and i have this tendency even the first

1908.24 --> 1911.6
time

1909.039 --> 1913.679
i see somebody to really straightly look

1911.6 --> 1916.32
them into the eye and

1913.679 --> 1917.679
smile warmly and that might be a little

1916.32 --> 1919.6789999999999
overwhelming to

1917.679 --> 1922.72
a lot of women out there that are just

1919.679 --> 1924.5590000000002
used to a lot of [ __ ] being around

1922.72 --> 1926.0
squirt boys that don't even look up from

1924.559 --> 1935.84
their mobile

1926.0 --> 1935.84
right it might just be that i don't know

1937.36 --> 1944.24
okay drunken bullet 141 takes courage

1941.039 --> 1948.399
but at some point you know it

1944.24 --> 1950.96
the original obstacle is really tough to

1948.399 --> 1952.4799999999998
overcome right to really get honest to

1950.96 --> 1955.76
really

1952.48 --> 1958.559
not hold back anymore

1955.76 --> 1960.64
but once you cross that boundary it

1958.559 --> 1963.84
actually becomes more difficult to stop

1960.64 --> 1963.8400000000001
doing it

1969.279 --> 1977.84
because i don't know because of just the

1973.76 --> 1977.84
effect that it has

1982.48 --> 1988.72
sometimes i wonder that if

1986.32 --> 1991.12
what i'm doing and being as honest and

1988.72 --> 1993.44
like directly connecting

1991.12 --> 1995.4399999999998
like presenting myself in a direct open

1993.44 --> 1997.519
connection and really direct like

1995.44 --> 1997.8400000000001
normally people would probably only do

1997.519 --> 2000.88
that

1997.84 --> 2002.0
in private situations with good

2000.88 --> 2004.3200000000002
friendships

2002.0 --> 2006.88
right i do it just like that and i think

2004.32 --> 2010.0
it has a bizarre

2006.88 --> 2013.679
bigger implication side effect

2010.0 --> 2016.88
that i do that not even just from you

2013.679 --> 2019.279
guys participating watching it but just

2016.88 --> 2022.24
that that exists that somebody decided

2019.279 --> 2024.799
to do it like that i think that that is

2022.24 --> 2025.84
potentially a sort of precedent setting

2024.799 --> 2029.36
thing

2025.84 --> 2031.6
because i don't know anybody out there

2029.36 --> 2033.1999999999998
that does it to the same level and

2031.6 --> 2033.6789999999999
there's a lot of people doing things

2033.2 --> 2036.88
live

2033.679 --> 2041.039
doing things raw doing things honest not

2036.88 --> 2042.72
like i do right

2041.039 --> 2044.72
and sometimes i think they shouldn't

2042.72 --> 2046.88
want to

2044.72 --> 2048.0
i'm just in this unique position where

2046.88 --> 2051.44
it's just

2048.0 --> 2054.879
better for me to do that than not do it

2051.44 --> 2057.2000000000003
because i'm like okay either you

2054.879 --> 2059.04
i'll simply shut my mouth and you

2057.2 --> 2061.919
literally won't get to know who i

2059.04 --> 2064.399
am or what i think beyond just talking

2061.919 --> 2067.1189999999997
about the weather and that's it

2064.399 --> 2069.1189999999997
or i open the door and you see how deep

2067.119 --> 2072.96
the rabbit hole goes

2069.119 --> 2075.28
that's it i i

2072.96 --> 2077.359
it's very hard to get in between and

2075.28 --> 2081.28
then stay on the persistent level like

2077.359 --> 2081.2799999999997
that for me it's really all or nothing

2083.599 --> 2090.079
right but i do feel that

2086.8 --> 2090.3990000000003
my all in some mysterious way is having

2090.079 --> 2093.9190000000003
a

2090.399 --> 2099.04
very wide influence that is almost

2093.919 --> 2099.04
in inexplicable

2099.119 --> 2105.119
it's inexplicable but i can feel it i

2102.0 --> 2105.119
can feel it's there

2106.4 --> 2110.8
like i feel i have a much wider

2109.2 --> 2114.3199999999997
influence on the world

2110.8 --> 2117.8390000000004
then i can logically reason out

2114.32 --> 2117.839
through the platform

2130.32 --> 2134.4
there is wisdom in all honesty

2134.8 --> 2137.2000000000003
yes

2138.079 --> 2148.5600000000004
clearly that's true also because

2145.359 --> 2150.56
that's kind of the point overcoming

2148.56 --> 2151.04
obstacles in your life and growing

2150.56 --> 2153.44
wisdom

2151.04 --> 2155.44
is all about being honest about your

2153.44 --> 2159.839
mistakes and then

2155.44 --> 2159.839
moving on

2161.76 --> 2166.88
so i'm kind of like okay well since i've

2165.119 --> 2170.48
already figured that out

2166.88 --> 2173.28
let's start right now with

2170.48 --> 2176.72
already overcoming the obstacles that i

2173.28 --> 2180.5600000000004
know are going to arrive at some point

2176.72 --> 2180.56
but i'm already going to take the right

2184.839 --> 2187.839
attitude

2188.16 --> 2192.3199999999997
it's almost like welcoming future

2190.32 --> 2195.76
mistakes instead of building

2192.32 --> 2197.6800000000003
walls to prevent others from seeing them

2195.76 --> 2199.0400000000004
as you know they will arrive or you

2197.68 --> 2200.72
don't know

2199.04 --> 2202.32
it might you might keep it purely

2200.72 --> 2206.9599999999996
subconsciously but you will

2202.32 --> 2210.48
build mechanisms to keep it secret

2206.96 --> 2210.88
even for yourself well instead of doing

2210.48 --> 2212.839
that

2210.88 --> 2214.56
what most people end up doing in their

2212.839 --> 2217.599
lives

2214.56 --> 2221.52
i am welcoming it

2217.599 --> 2225.04
i'm making a party out of it almost like

2221.52 --> 2228.8
yes this is the point

2225.04 --> 2232.16
this is the point the honesty honesty of

2228.8 --> 2235.92
weakness and mistakes and

2232.16 --> 2238.7999999999997
the proper response recognition

2235.92 --> 2239.92
and then finding that way through right

2238.8 --> 2243.599
finding the way through

2239.92 --> 2246.16
only works from a position of honesty

2243.599 --> 2246.88
if you can be honest that it is an

2246.16 --> 2249.1189999999997
obstacle

2246.88 --> 2251.119
then how can you find a way through

2249.119 --> 2257.839
right you can move around it

2251.119 --> 2257.839
that's not finding a way through

2268.839 --> 2275.44
yeah anyway

2272.0 --> 2275.44
my throat is still a little raw

2277.04 --> 2279.44
so

2280.4 --> 2287.6800000000003
right because i did throw up and

2284.32 --> 2291.04
like everything this is

2287.68 --> 2293.7599999999998
it wasn't like oh no i my stomach is

2291.04 --> 2297.2
different no it's like

2293.76 --> 2301.6800000000003
a emergency emergency

2297.2 --> 2304.24
we need to depressurize this right now

2301.68 --> 2305.2799999999997
more like that and when that happens

2304.24 --> 2308.56
like really

2305.28 --> 2311.599
disgusting [ __ ] also yeah

2308.56 --> 2314.72
beyond just superficial

2311.599 --> 2316.7200000000003
that it kind of hurts the throat if you

2314.72 --> 2321.1189999999997
have any experience with that but

2316.72 --> 2321.1189999999997
let me not make you think about it too

2324.839 --> 2327.839
much

2339.2 --> 2344.0789999999997
right but yeah i'm feeling okay

2345.76 --> 2351.92
all right so that's it for all

2348.96 --> 2351.92
our win and this

2353.359 --> 2358.24
internal workings and spiritual

2355.599 --> 2361.28
reflections ooh

2358.24 --> 2363.359
i'm so worthy of everybody's and

2361.28 --> 2368.48
let me not get out too like much like

2363.359 --> 2371.52
that just

2368.48 --> 2374.56
but i do blabber on about myself don't i

2371.52 --> 2376.0
right i just like if i'm gonna blabber

2374.56 --> 2379.7599999999998
on about myself

2376.0 --> 2382.48
like a lot of other people then at least

2379.76 --> 2384.48
i'll try to figure out something about

2382.48 --> 2386.48
myself to talk about that people can

2384.48 --> 2388.0
learn from right so that's my strategy

2386.48 --> 2389.599
always finding the way through if i'm

2388.0 --> 2392.72
gonna be a blabber

2389.599 --> 2397.599
then at least i'll blabber about stuff

2392.72 --> 2400.56
in a way that is

2397.599 --> 2401.599
at least halfway worth your time uh

2400.56 --> 2403.52
anyway

2401.599 --> 2405.04
activities yeah yesterday's flat earth

2403.52 --> 2408.8
debate was great

2405.04 --> 2410.56
again akumu virus came back in

2408.8 --> 2413.599
pretty much doing the same thing that he

2410.56 --> 2413.599
did friday

2420.079 --> 2424.319
oh god oh buddy yeah mitchell from

2422.319 --> 2427.68
australia that video of yours was

2424.319 --> 2430.8
so funny was it wasn't it just

2427.68 --> 2434.64
what was that no no wait it was uh

2430.8 --> 2436.6400000000003
flat side yeah did it

2434.64 --> 2438.24
metropharma yeah it was not funny mitch

2436.64 --> 2439.2
that it was a good feeling it wasn't

2438.24 --> 2441.4399999999996
funny though

2439.2 --> 2443.9199999999996
yeah flat did anybody see flat swords

2441.44 --> 2445.839
blue is confused video holy [ __ ] that

2443.92 --> 2450.0
was so funny

2445.839 --> 2450.0
it's a quick paced editing together

2451.44 --> 2454.88
of on camera things that were said said

2454.56 --> 2457.2
by

2454.88 --> 2459.359
blue marble and newly grass tyson it's

2457.2 --> 2463.2
it's such a funny video

2459.359 --> 2463.2
check it out if you haven't seen it

2464.24 --> 2469.68
a flat i'll just link you up it's a like

2467.44 --> 2472.56
a 50 minute video but every minute of it

2469.68 --> 2476.16
is just great

2472.56 --> 2476.16
hey amanda young good to see you

2478.4 --> 2483.599
make sense of vitamin c and low fruit

2481.28 --> 2483.599
dude

2485.92 --> 2490.2400000000002
you don't have to tell me to take

2487.68 --> 2491.5989999999997
vitamins i take vitamins i got all the

2490.24 --> 2495.2799999999997
vitamin d

2491.599 --> 2499.04
b and c standardized

2495.28 --> 2499.76
it's right there no it's not that i'm

2499.04 --> 2501.68
not like oh

2499.76 --> 2503.44
i'm under the weather because i don't

2501.68 --> 2505.44
have enough nutrition now this was

2503.44 --> 2508.4
purely stress related

2505.44 --> 2509.28
and if i had been depleted on like

2508.4 --> 2513.359
vitamin c

2509.28 --> 2516.7200000000003
and d then it would probably

2513.359 --> 2516.72
have been even worse

2520.0 --> 2526.48
but yes i'm definitely keeping track of

2523.68 --> 2526.48
my vitamins

2529.68 --> 2534.319
hello tom parker by the way and good

2531.359 --> 2534.319
servant good to see you

2534.88 --> 2538.8
it's like teaching a fish how to swim

2545.92 --> 2551.839
akuma just wants to float

2561.28 --> 2566.48
what is that hello gary benga

2567.839 --> 2571.92
but yeah bad karma like when i'm like

2570.24 --> 2574.8799999999997
that

2571.92 --> 2576.0
unless your remedy is something you can

2574.88 --> 2578.1600000000003
like

2576.0 --> 2579.119
put on your skin or something it's not

2578.16 --> 2581.92
going to be useful

2579.119 --> 2581.92
because yeah

2582.72 --> 2587.5989999999997
like during that whole time when i was

2585.119 --> 2591.04
like on high trigger

2587.599 --> 2592.0
nauseated and all that there's nothing i

2591.04 --> 2594.56
can take in

2592.0 --> 2596.4
right and then after it's over after i

2594.56 --> 2598.4
got it back under control

2596.4 --> 2600.079
then there's nothing i need to take in

2598.4 --> 2603.839
because after that

2600.079 --> 2603.8390000000004
like the purging effect

2605.04 --> 2610.16
like you're cleaner afterward right it's

2608.72 --> 2613.2799999999997
weird

2610.16 --> 2617.1189999999997
having this that's why i call it a purge

2613.28 --> 2619.76
it's my body forcing a purge

2617.119 --> 2622.1600000000003
and the stress is the trigger but it is

2619.76 --> 2624.079
a natural thing in a way and it has like

2622.16 --> 2625.68
an afterward situation where i'm not

2624.079 --> 2628.8
like oh my god

2625.68 --> 2631.52
this one specific related organ is now

2628.8 --> 2633.28
worse because of this no no no no

2631.52 --> 2637.92
afterward i feel better

2633.28 --> 2642.3190000000004
than a period before that so

2637.92 --> 2642.319
it effectively functions as a sort of a

2646.839 --> 2649.839
purge

2655.04 --> 2659.68
makes me feel asleep and okay oh so you

2657.68 --> 2660.8799999999997
need some sleep assistance do you bad

2659.68 --> 2664.319
karma

2660.88 --> 2666.8
that does not surprise me

2664.319 --> 2667.599
yeah i have absolutely no trouble

2666.8 --> 2670.6400000000003
sleeping

2667.599 --> 2672.56
whatsoever like ever right

2670.64 --> 2673.68
the only reason i couldn't sleep now is

2672.56 --> 2676.56
because

2673.68 --> 2678.319
literally my organs were like yeah

2676.56 --> 2679.68
that's cute that you want to sleep now

2678.319 --> 2682.64
but we're about to

2679.68 --> 2684.8799999999997
explode that feeling right doesn't

2682.64 --> 2687.68
really matter what you take or do

2684.88 --> 2688.48
it's not going to work when it's like

2687.68 --> 2691.04
that

2688.48 --> 2695.28
first you have to resolve that then i

2691.04 --> 2695.2799999999997
can just go back to sleep no worries

2695.76 --> 2700.7200000000003
like even when i still have the weird

2698.56 --> 2704.7999999999997
dread sensation effect going

2700.72 --> 2709.7599999999998
like i can literally peacefully sleep

2704.8 --> 2713.3590000000004
successfully as sense of dread

2709.76 --> 2716.0
is trying to confuse me yeah i'm that

2713.359 --> 2718.96
good at sleeping

2716.0 --> 2719.68
i can be in a psychotic nightmare and i

2718.96 --> 2723.68
could still

2719.68 --> 2727.2
peacefully sleep because i learned to do

2723.68 --> 2729.68
that as a survival mechanism

2727.2 --> 2732.16
i just it naturally developed like i

2729.68 --> 2732.96
learned how to meditate it's part of i'm

2732.16 --> 2735.5989999999997
an elf

2732.96 --> 2736.48
again it's the freaking elf every time

2735.599 --> 2738.4
i'm an elf

2736.48 --> 2739.839
yeah what do elves do they don't sleep

2738.4 --> 2744.1600000000003
no they meditate

2739.839 --> 2745.92
yeah i meditate it works really well

2744.16 --> 2747.44
i don't know if it works just as well

2745.92 --> 2751.2000000000003
for others but what i do

2747.44 --> 2754.079
it it seems like meditation

2751.2 --> 2755.4399999999996
and it works extremely well i don't need

2754.079 --> 2758.96
sleeping medication

2755.44 --> 2761.68
ever like not even melatonin

2758.96 --> 2763.68
now way back in my teens when i hadn't

2761.68 --> 2767.1189999999997
really developed this skill

2763.68 --> 2768.96
i'd had trouble sleeping and i would

2767.119 --> 2772.4
have like

2768.96 --> 2773.04
i can't let down my guard kind of thing

2772.4 --> 2775.119
keeping you

2773.04 --> 2777.52
i don't have that anymore because i can

2775.119 --> 2783.76
just meditate it and just decide

2777.52 --> 2783.7599999999998
like nope you are now going into sleep

2786.839 --> 2789.839
mode

2791.359 --> 2798.0789999999997
okay having hd hdd can be a problem when

2795.44 --> 2800.64
gunked yeah no [ __ ]

2798.079 --> 2802.4
well anything can be a problem when you

2800.64 --> 2805.44
have adhd

2802.4 --> 2807.119
especially if it has to be in some kind

2805.44 --> 2809.2000000000003
of a time slot

2807.119 --> 2810.319
so there's no hurry then usually things

2809.2 --> 2813.04
would go

2810.319 --> 2814.319
perfectly smooth and if there's a hurry

2813.04 --> 2816.48
if there's a time slot then

2814.319 --> 2817.68
suddenly everything will start to

2816.48 --> 2819.359
discontort yeah

2817.68 --> 2820.7999999999997
well i don't have those problems

2819.359 --> 2823.52
thankfully

2820.8 --> 2830.8
are you capable of lucid dreaming uh i

2823.52 --> 2834.24
lose a dream all the time

2830.8 --> 2834.88
when i'm like having this sort of a

2834.24 --> 2838.24
sickness

2834.88 --> 2842.7200000000003
thing right during it i

2838.24 --> 2842.72
lose it dream the [ __ ] out of the place

2842.839 --> 2850.72
right like as soon as the

2846.64 --> 2853.1189999999997
lock like the spiritual lock

2850.72 --> 2859.04
on the organ that is actually causing

2853.119 --> 2862.8
the whole instability as soon as it goes

2859.04 --> 2865.839
the yeah lucid dream clears up

2862.8 --> 2868.079
you become you don't

2865.839 --> 2868.96
yeah you lose the distraction from the

2868.079 --> 2871.2000000000003
body

2868.96 --> 2873.599
and then have to lose a dream remaining

2871.2 --> 2877.4399999999996
it seems to be happening every time

2873.599 --> 2877.44
i go through that every single time

2878.16 --> 2887.1189999999997
so and it was weird because i even

2882.319 --> 2890.8
since a very very very long time ago

2887.119 --> 2894.6400000000003
conjured raw wild

2890.8 --> 2897.3590000000004
imagery things that were happening

2894.64 --> 2899.04
that were literally even frequency wise

2897.359 --> 2901.839
out of my control and i

2899.04 --> 2901.839
let it happen

2903.599 --> 2908.319
that was weird like literally seeing a

2906.96 --> 2912.4
holographic

2908.319 --> 2914.8
real thing happening that is not

2912.4 --> 2916.8
purely just doing exactly what i'm

2914.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
thinking

2916.8 --> 2929.8390000000004
that's a weird sensation yeah

2937.68 --> 2943.839
never heard of that what is that

2956.24 --> 2959.359
your gray hair is turning more brown

2958.24 --> 2962.24
really

2959.359 --> 2962.24
that's hilarious

2965.44 --> 2971.839
but what is it

2982.079 --> 2986.4
scotch before bed oh dear god

2987.04 --> 2994.319
no no i specifically

2990.88 --> 2996.559
avoid having alcohol in my system when i

2994.319 --> 3000.16
go to sleep

2996.559 --> 3000.1600000000003
specifically avoid that

3006.8 --> 3011.6800000000003
is a micro minerals

3009.92 --> 3013.76
that you don't get in gmo oh well i

3011.68 --> 3014.7999999999997
don't get gmo food so that shouldn't be

3013.76 --> 3019.28
a problem then

3014.8 --> 3019.28
i eat organic only only

3019.92 --> 3024.8
i've been avoiding gmo food since the

3024.839 --> 3028.0
90s

3026.319 --> 3041.839
pretty much since it first started to

3028.0 --> 3041.839
came out come out

3066.839 --> 3069.839
hmm

3075.119 --> 3083.839
look it up

3091.52 --> 3099.2
fulvic acid that's what

3096.319 --> 3099.2
is that what it is

3101.68 --> 3111.839
wait what

3118.4 --> 3126.1600000000003
what an actual

3122.839 --> 3129.44
date from high mountain rock so it's

3126.16 --> 3139.839
actually like raw mineral extract

3129.44 --> 3139.839
how bizarre

3141.04 --> 3147.119
huh right it's it's used in ayurvedic

3145.92 --> 3153.839
medicine

3147.119 --> 3153.839
it says here huh

3157.359 --> 3164.0
developed over centuries from the slow

3160.48 --> 3164.0
decomposition of plants

3165.04 --> 3172.64
wow so

3168.24 --> 3176.0789999999997
holy [ __ ] so that's amazing

3172.64 --> 3179.68
but is it

3176.079 --> 3182.88
decomposing so it's like

3179.68 --> 3185.7599999999998
what they say is

3182.88 --> 3188.319
fossil fuel remember supposedly the

3185.76 --> 3189.76
rotting plants and dinos and whatever

3188.319 --> 3191.68
they turn to oil

3189.76 --> 3194.7200000000003
well it seems like this stuff is

3191.68 --> 3198.0789999999997
actually what it would turn into

3194.72 --> 3201.5989999999997
it's just complete black

3198.079 --> 3203.92
fermented plants

3201.599 --> 3206.1600000000003
that have been sitting there for a very

3203.92 --> 3208.8
long time

3206.16 --> 3209.5989999999997
apparently this is from what i'm reading

3208.8 --> 3212.4
here

3209.599 --> 3212.4
fascinating

3221.119 --> 3226.079

i'm not it yeah you can stop projecting

3306.24 --> 3310.0789999999997

where you're just imagining how

3313.119 --> 3317.0

well if you turn that screen off

3339.599 --> 3343.599

of your ugly [ __ ] face in there and

that because you can't turn off

3544.079 --> 3548.96
your freaking mobile screen long enough

3546.64 --> 3549.52
to see your own freaking reflection in

3548.96 --> 3551.359

3549.52 --> 3554.4
yeah you don't even know what you look

3551.359 --> 3559.839

3594.72 --> 3601.839
great energy

3602.96 --> 3608.7200000000003
wouldn't want to meet his mother who is

3605.119 --> 3608.7200000000003
to say they have a mother-in-law

3612.4 --> 3619.28
there's people that that chat

3615.76 --> 3621.2000000000003

3619.28 --> 3623.76
they're married

3621.2 --> 3624.8799999999997
on the other hand maybe they are married

3623.76 --> 3627.0400000000004
and they're just so

3624.88 --> 3628.079
cocked and out of control of their own

3627.04 --> 3632.079
marriage

3628.079 --> 3635.52
that they have to project that

3632.079 --> 3635.52
onto trolling

3637.52 --> 3641.52
at best otherwise i can't really imagine

3640.079 --> 3644.88
why you wouldn't

3641.52 --> 3648.079
assume they have a mother-in-law

3644.88 --> 3657.6800000000003

4362.719 --> 4365.76
weird youtube

weird

4375.12 --> 4379.04
i'm getting an oakley sunglasses

4378.08 --> 4385.84
advertisement

4379.04 --> 4385.84
now that i refresh the page oakley 2021

4386.08 --> 4390.08
i'm going to show this it's so funny

4391.12 --> 4399.84
seriously check it out

4424.84 --> 4427.84
anyway

4435.04 --> 4443.84
yeah i agree pj krishank

4440.32 --> 4444.48
i mean i can appreciate really good and

4443.84 --> 4449.1990000000005
intense

4444.48 --> 4449.199
sex with a with a proper woman

4450.88 --> 4455.84
but yeah

4456.08 --> 4461.12
porn in general is pretty it's just like

4458.64 --> 4461.12
gross

4461.52 --> 4469.84
didn't know nathan sold sunglasses

4470.239 --> 4483.839999999999
all right

4492.719 --> 4497.12
you're right tom parker that's a really

4494.88 --> 4498.4800000000005
sneaky way to ask for a wrench back now

4497.12 --> 4501.599999999999
it's okay

4498.48 --> 4503.678999999999
but you've already kind of like showed

4501.6 --> 4504.08
in the past that you don't really wield

4503.679 --> 4507.679
it

4504.08 --> 4511.84
all that well so

4507.679 --> 4511.84
it'll be all right i'm taking care of it

4514.64 --> 4520.88
why a couple need porn to get you i do

4517.84 --> 4525.76
i don't know pj creed shank i don't know

4520.88 --> 4527.92
why they would

4525.76 --> 4530.08
it's okay tom parker don't worry about

4527.92 --> 4530.08
it

4530.159 --> 4539.839999999999
i can take care of it

4544.48 --> 4547.5199999999995
maybe you're prude

4550.84 --> 4553.84
no

4556.159 --> 4563.28
and i think that porn is just degrading

4559.84 --> 4567.84
and like the people that actually

4563.28 --> 4571.199
do it that make those videos like

4567.84 --> 4574.64
they don't even care like they it's just

4571.199 --> 4581.839999999999
business to them like

4574.64 --> 4581.84
and that all reflects off it dude

4585.92 --> 4590.4800000000005
so what effectively happens you start to

4589.92 --> 4594.4
obsess

4590.48 --> 4596.959999999999
over situ

4594.4 --> 4598.239
describing it's almost gross it's just

4596.96 --> 4601.36
that

4598.239 --> 4604.718999999999
you zone in on something that doesn't

4601.36 --> 4608.159
doesn't have any a real passion

4604.719 --> 4611.92
and then you don't connect up like that

4608.159 --> 4614.239
right you don't

4611.92 --> 4615.92
have the spark i don't i don't like

4614.239 --> 4618.08
talking about it owen benjamin talks

4615.92 --> 4619.4400000000005
about it a lot more and he's a lot more

4618.08 --> 4621.6
effective at it but i

4619.44 --> 4624.239
pretty much agree with everything he

4621.6 --> 4627.76
said about it

4624.239 --> 4637.839999999999
including that it's it's gay all porno

4627.76 --> 4637.84
is gay porno

4663.84 --> 4668.400000000001
tom parker stop it you're not getting a

4666.08 --> 4668.4

4678.0 --> 4682.48
literally staring at chad i'm not now

4680.48 --> 4685.12
unrolling a big conversation that's

4682.48 --> 4688.32
gonna take up all of my concentration

4685.12 --> 4690.8
right i've pretty much done most of that

4688.32 --> 4694.0
the rest of the show hey james mason see

4690.8 --> 4694.0
he's right there with a wrench

4697.12 --> 4707.84
but yeah i when i take care of the chat

i'm a lot quicker than most of you

4707.84 --> 4712.88
i'm a very quick chat moderator in

4718.84 --> 4726.159000000001
general

4720.96 --> 4726.159
okay tom parker fine i didn't see it

4727.5 --> 4735.84
[Music]

4730.0 --> 4735.84
that's all right

4748.8 --> 4755.28
uh no george sanford

4752.239 --> 4759.12
all porno is gay porno

4755.28 --> 4762.48
i'm sorry if you're defending porn

4759.12 --> 4765.92
that means you're gay

4762.48 --> 4777.839999999999
by owen benjamin lore standard so

4765.92 --> 4777.84
yeah i'm sorry dude

4790.88 --> 4797.52
oh really so you watch

4793.92 --> 4805.84
singular woman squirting on screen

4797.52 --> 4805.84
sorry how is that not gay

4811.84 --> 4816.400000000001
what if it's just less yeah that's hey

4814.719 --> 4819.52
tom burger

4816.4 --> 4822.799999999999
lesbians are gay i

4819.52 --> 4825.92
don't know thought about that before

4822.8 --> 4825.92
but yeah

4827.44 --> 4834.879999999999
how is it gay it's porn

4831.44 --> 4835.36
i don't if i can't explain this to you

4834.88 --> 4847.84
then

4835.36 --> 4847.839999999999
i can't help you sorry

4854.88 --> 4863.12
right and theoretically

4858.08 --> 4866.48
even if somebody could engage

4863.12 --> 4869.84
that weren't gay yeah it's

4866.48 --> 4873.44
or whatever it's like the people that do

4869.84 --> 4876.88
it are mostly gay

4873.44 --> 4880.159
i think even like officially so

4876.88 --> 4881.52
yeah oh you didn't know you didn't want

4880.159 --> 4889.839999999999
to know

4881.52 --> 4889.84
yeah well they are

4901.6 --> 4908.159000000001
yeah slow mo that's even and worse

4905.12 --> 4908.8
dude the sliding scale in porn into the

4908.159 --> 4911.599999999999
darkness

4908.8 --> 4911.6
is terrible

4912.96 --> 4916.4
but it only happens once you start to

4915.52 --> 4920.8
ignore

4916.4 --> 4922.638999999999
that it is wrong and immoral in ways

4920.8 --> 4924.4800000000005
and then you'll find out that there's

4922.639 --> 4927.12
just so much dark [ __ ]

4924.48 --> 4929.04
out there it's it's i don't even want to

4927.12 --> 4932.48
think about it literally i don't

4929.04 --> 4935.04
it's terrible what happens to some of

4932.48 --> 4935.04
these people

4942.0 --> 4945.04
right but slow mo moon buggy on the

4943.76 --> 4947.4400000000005
other hand i don't

4945.04 --> 4948.239
know i shouldn't even comment you can

4947.44 --> 4951.678999999999
kind of tell

4948.239 --> 4952.48
which ones though which ones are going

4951.679 --> 4955.84
to end up

4952.48 --> 4959.839999999999
[ __ ] literally just

4955.84 --> 4959.84
i yeah

4984.32 --> 4988.32
sidetracked by trolls again how how so i

4987.44 --> 4991.599999999999
don't see it

4988.32 --> 4991.599999999999
i didn't even mention it's just

4992.48 --> 5001.839999999999
i know how this troll works it's not

4994.8 --> 5001.84
sidestepping anything

5004.88 --> 5008.0
like if you all immediately jump onto

5007.679 --> 5012.32
the

5008.0 --> 5013.04
troll thing and make it a subject then

5012.32 --> 5014.88
yeah well

5013.04 --> 5017.36
you all made it into the subject and

5014.88 --> 5019.92
then we talk about the subject

5017.36 --> 5019.92
and that's it

5024.56 --> 5029.84
what okay

5054.88 --> 5057.84
uh

5062.159 --> 5068.32
all right i've never even heard of linda

5064.96 --> 5071.84
lovelace before pj krishan but

5068.32 --> 5071.84
i'm sure that that did happen

5117.92 --> 5122.56
yeah but the thing that also messes it

5120.8 --> 5126.2390000000005
up the whole situation

5122.56 --> 5127.84
every time that so many of these foreign

5126.239 --> 5131.919999999999
actresses

5127.84 --> 5131.92
like they go on drugs

5132.48 --> 5138.959999999999
and that amount tends to increase

5135.92 --> 5142.4
over time if they repeat

5138.96 --> 5146.639
the same actions right

5142.4 --> 5150.0
because they wouldn't be able to

5146.639 --> 5153.1990000000005
do all that crap without it

5150.0 --> 5155.36
they need like this blanket to to make

5153.199 --> 5157.04
them prevent them from understanding

5155.36 --> 5160.639
what the hell they're actually doing and

5157.04 --> 5163.28
how gross it really is and how little

5160.639 --> 5165.12
those men actually care and how

5163.28 --> 5165.679
blatantly obvious that is right it's

5165.12 --> 5167.5199999999995
like

5165.679 --> 5170.159
you don't really want to do it so you

5167.52 --> 5170.159000000001
drug up

5170.32 --> 5177.199
so you don't know anymore it just

5173.36 --> 5180.799999999999
but that's really unhealthy

5177.199 --> 5184.239
like well i don't even need to describe

5180.8 --> 5184.2390000000005
why i think

5184.88 --> 5188.719
but it yeah the drugs a lot of the time

5187.52 --> 5191.52
is the thing that like

5188.719 --> 5194.0
really messes it up because it's there

5191.52 --> 5196.4800000000005
to camouflage how terrible it really is

5194.0 --> 5198.639
and you still let it happen

5196.48 --> 5200.32
so there is damage that you literally

5198.639 --> 5203.76
have to cover up

5200.32 --> 5205.44
from your own experience or you wouldn't

5203.76 --> 5206.320000000001
be able to go through it right now

5205.44 --> 5211.839999999999
that's

5206.32 --> 5211.84
a bad deal if you ask me

5222.719 --> 5225.84
i really hate porn

5226.96 --> 5231.04
well i'd agree in general yes

5236.84 --> 5239.84
yes

5257.12 --> 5259.36
right

5262.08 --> 5266.239
i'd say almost like the major reason

5264.96 --> 5269.679
that i

5266.239 --> 5269.678999999999
don't like it and i

5270.159 --> 5273.92
that i'm repulsed by so much of it is

5272.88 --> 5277.76
because it is

5273.92 --> 5278.4
fake because there's no actual passion

5277.76 --> 5280.56
right

5278.4 --> 5281.679
the whole thing about sex what i really

5280.56 --> 5286.159000000001
appreciate about it

5281.679 --> 5290.56
is the natural

5286.159 --> 5293.44
thing about it the instincts the

5290.56 --> 5294.080000000001
the natural cycles and the responses to

5293.44 --> 5298.48
smell

5294.08 --> 5301.92
and the hormones like the nature of it

5298.48 --> 5305.678999999999
and of sex yeah i really appreciate that

5301.92 --> 5308.88
well that's all just it's just fake

5305.679 --> 5312.0
porn is fake and that's what really

5308.88 --> 5312.0
makes it so terrible

5312.08 --> 5316.32
because you can't make an industry out

5314.32 --> 5323.679
of that and it being real that's just

5316.32 --> 5326.159
not possible it's not how people work

5323.679 --> 5328.4
people are not built to constantly do

5326.159 --> 5328.4
that

5330.48 --> 5337.839999999999
it will just drain them

5349.52 --> 5351.84
hmm

5362.32 --> 5366.799999999999
right yes yes getting wisdom yeah that's

5364.96 --> 5368.8
that's a good point

5366.8 --> 5371.679
the real attractiveness and this i've

5368.8 --> 5375.84
already identified this for myself

5371.679 --> 5379.12
about women is not just oh sex

5375.84 --> 5382.92
no it's more about

5379.12 --> 5386.4
how sexy is their mind how

5382.92 --> 5388.88
frustrated with the world about not

5386.4 --> 5391.5199999999995
being able to do

5388.88 --> 5392.08
to express yourself as much with actual

5391.52 --> 5395.1990000000005
worthy

5392.08 --> 5395.199
talents and all that

5396.719 --> 5404.719
like real talent i find incredibly sexy

5401.36 --> 5404.719
like really sexy

5404.88 --> 5410.32
like that can even shine through

5408.239 --> 5412.959999999999
somebody that's physically not super

5410.32 --> 5418.08
attractive and make them attractive

5412.96 --> 5420.08
if it's real it shines right through

5418.08 --> 5421.28
right and that part is much more

5420.08 --> 5424.639
important

5421.28 --> 5425.5199999999995
if it's just some person that has no

5424.639 --> 5429.36
ambitions

5425.52 --> 5432.080000000001
no natural spirit left no

5429.36 --> 5432.639
like impulses to do natural things and

5432.08 --> 5434.32
they just

5432.639 --> 5436.400000000001
hang around all the time and oh they

5434.32 --> 5438.0
happen to look sexy

5436.4 --> 5441.28
and they might be a [ __ ] or whatever

5438.0 --> 5441.28
that's like wow

5443.36 --> 5450.4
how is that rewarding

5446.56 --> 5450.400000000001
you don't get anything and it's like

5452.88 --> 5457.76
for me sex is all much so much about

5456.0 --> 5459.28
that connection about the connection of

5457.76 --> 5462.320000000001
the spirit of

5459.28 --> 5465.759999999999
like getting the tension together

5462.32 --> 5467.759999999999
and then afterwards the release and then

5465.76 --> 5471.1990000000005
the tension is off and you start to

5467.76 --> 5471.1990000000005
connect in so many ways

5472.0 --> 5477.04
that's disgusting dude right you connect

5475.12 --> 5480.159
in so many ways spiritually and

5477.04 --> 5484.639
suddenly you can build

5480.159 --> 5484.638999999999
together in the mind very easily

5488.4 --> 5495.679
because you connected it right

5491.679 --> 5495.679
now that's real sexiness to me

5497.44 --> 5505.919999999999
the real reward in sex is not the sex

5502.719 --> 5509.28
it's what what

5505.92 --> 5512.159
just honest

5509.28 --> 5513.5199999999995
based on love sex with the person that

5512.159 --> 5517.36
actually matches

5513.52 --> 5521.679
your character in effective ways

5517.36 --> 5525.04
what it yields what comes out of it

5521.679 --> 5525.04
that's the real sexiness

5526.56 --> 5533.84
to me

5552.8 --> 5556.639
yes i totally agree with that too pj

5555.36 --> 5559.28
krishan

5556.639 --> 5560.56
like a real intimacy of a couple that is

5559.28 --> 5563.84
pure and not

5560.56 --> 5566.56
like abusing one another or trying to

5563.84 --> 5568.4800000000005
trick one out that are genuinely in love

5566.56 --> 5570.96
like yeah there might not be a lot of

5568.48 --> 5573.36
boinky boinky or whatever nudity

5570.96 --> 5576.0
but like the energy that comes off it is

5573.36 --> 5578.5599999999995
like whoa

5576.0 --> 5578.56
like that

5580.0 --> 5583.199
like yeah i always take notice of this

5582.48 --> 5586.839999999999
like if i see

5583.199 --> 5590.96
like a new couple whatever being

5586.84 --> 5590.96
romantic in a modest way that's like

5591.28 --> 5599.5199999999995
get like this feeling like whoa heavy

5595.76 --> 5603.360000000001
and i had that feeling myself when i was

5599.52 --> 5617.84
with yeah in love with my girl

5603.36 --> 5617.839999999999
it's awesome

5625.92 --> 5631.84
dude yeah peachy crochet look that that

5628.56 --> 5631.84
person probably never

5633.36 --> 5638.0
touched a woman without having paid them

5636.96 --> 5640.719
in advance

5638.0 --> 5642.239
right so yeah of course it's all going

5640.719 --> 5646.08
to be plastic

5642.239 --> 5646.08
right plastic card

5646.159 --> 5652.638999999999
and all the other plastic things

5649.679 --> 5653.84
involved in prostitution and etc etc

5652.639 --> 5659.84
yeah yeah

5653.84 --> 5659.84
it's just petty

5660.0 --> 5664.32
never mind the troll this is i think

5663.76 --> 5673.84
somebody

5664.32 --> 5673.84
really needs some attention i think yeah

5681.04 --> 5684.719
right by the way for everybody getting

5682.88 --> 5687.1990000000005
distracted do make sure you

5684.719 --> 5701.84
watch flat so it's latest video it is

5687.199 --> 5701.839999999999
really fun

5702.639 --> 5709.28
multimeter measures altitude by changing

5706.639 --> 5713.52
atmospheric pressure

5709.28 --> 5716.32
uh partially at least

5713.52 --> 5720.2390000000005
right because there is kind of a

5716.32 --> 5720.239
pressure gradient consistency

5727.52 --> 5732.320000000001
right but altimeters aren't the only

5729.679 --> 5736.2390000000005
orientation mechanism for that

5732.32 --> 5736.239
for airplanes especially modern day

5741.679 --> 5746.56
all right so yeah flat earth debate is

5745.36 --> 5748.159
going to be live

5746.56 --> 5749.92
after this and i think i'm going to

5748.159 --> 5752.159
round out a little early it's been kind

5749.92 --> 5755.4400000000005
of a short show but

5752.159 --> 5756.0
i need a break so you agree there yeah

5755.44 --> 5758.32
no [ __ ]

5756.0 --> 5759.28
there's a pressure gradient yeah you

5758.32 --> 5762.08
know why

5759.28 --> 5763.5199999999995
there's a pressure gradient because

5762.08 --> 5765.119
there's gas pressure you know where

5763.52 --> 5766.4800000000005
there's gas pressure because there's a

5765.119 --> 5769.679
container

5766.48 --> 5773.5199999999995
gas pressure gradients have a

5769.679 --> 5776.639
container as a prerequisite

5773.52 --> 5776.639
as an antecedent

5777.6 --> 5782.719
yeah cool indeed isn't it yeah

5780.8 --> 5784.4800000000005
you can't have gas pressure gradients

5782.719 --> 5787.04
without a container

5784.48 --> 5787.919999999999
because they always come secondary first

5787.04 --> 5790.48
the gas have

5787.92 --> 5791.119
has to and it will because it's natural

5790.48 --> 5793.919999999999
law

5791.119 --> 5795.839999999999
spread in all directions to fill the

5793.92 --> 5799.1990000000005
volume of the container

5795.84 --> 5801.52
then by pressing on the container walls

5799.199 --> 5803.599999999999
creating the effective gas pressure

5801.52 --> 5805.4400000000005
right without pressing on container

5803.6 --> 5807.1990000000005
walls there is no gas pressure

5805.44 --> 5810.4
because it all presses against one

5807.199 --> 5810.4
another uniformly

5810.48 --> 5813.678999999999
and the combined pressure against all

5812.4 --> 5816.719
the container walls

5813.679 --> 5818.08
causes the effective stable gas pressure

5816.719 --> 5820.08
within right

5818.08 --> 5821.44
and yeah whatever other influences are

5820.08 --> 5825.679
there like heat

5821.44 --> 5830.08
cold influences will then locally

5825.679 --> 5830.08
create pressure gradation

5835.119 --> 5840.719
this atmosphere self-contained oh

5838.88 --> 5842.159000000001
really can you demonstrate that why

5840.719 --> 5844.4
don't you try it out

5842.159 --> 5847.199
try try this demonstrating that on the

5844.4 --> 5847.199
flat earth debate

5849.199 --> 5855.36
oh can it oh atmospheric well atmosphere

5853.199 --> 5857.599999999999
is a model that doesn't actually exist

5855.36 --> 5860.88
because it defies natural law

5857.6 --> 5863.119000000001
but hey if you can demonstrate pressure

5860.88 --> 5864.400000000001
existing as a gradient without a

5863.119 --> 5866.96
container i'd like to see a

5864.4 --> 5869.839999999999
demonstration of that

5866.96 --> 5869.84
numpty

5879.36 --> 5882.48
right so we're all eager for the flat

5881.28 --> 5884.88
earth debates to start

5882.48 --> 5884.879999999999
i guess

5886.88 --> 5893.04
it's maybe good to move on

5890.159 --> 5896.08
right so thanks everyone for coming i

5893.04 --> 5899.5199999999995
hope you like this show

5896.08 --> 5901.76
i didn't think it was bad i feel a lot

5899.52 --> 5904.719
more stable now by the way than i did

5901.76 --> 5904.719
when it started out

5905.36 --> 5910.96
but yeah i'll just keep on going i don't

5909.199 --> 5912.48
know if i'm gonna continue the title

5910.96 --> 5915.92
card situation

5912.48 --> 5918.239
maybe put it on a halt it was wearing on

5915.92 --> 5921.36
me a little

5918.239 --> 5923.44
but yeah i'll keep on going for as long

5921.36 --> 5927.92
as it goes i did get

5923.44 --> 5929.678999999999
paypal help that absolutely matters

5927.92 --> 5931.4400000000005
if i hadn't gotten any i don't know what

5929.679 --> 5935.119
i would have done

5931.44 --> 5938.0
it matters so thank you so much again

5935.119 --> 5940.08
i really appreciate it guys right so

and i'm going to join the flat earth

5980.159 --> 5983.5199999999995
debates which should start up any minute

5982.48 --> 5986.638999999999
now

5983.52 --> 5995.6900000000005
so hope to see you there in chat
