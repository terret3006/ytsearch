90.0 --> 94.56
it's quite a beautiful day out there

97.2 --> 103.36
very very sunny and warm

100.56 --> 104.0
there's just no wind at all and yeah it

103.36 --> 107.36
makes

104.0 --> 112.24
really warm there's a bit

107.36 --> 112.24
hazy stuff going on up there though

113.04 --> 116.56
it seems like it might have had some

115.6 --> 119.83999999999999
kind of plane

116.56 --> 120.71900000000001
involvement at some point but yeah

119.84 --> 129.84
despite that

120.719 --> 129.84
it's really nice and sunny and warm

131.2 --> 135.2
i regretted this morning going to bed so

133.52 --> 136.959
late because that meant that

135.2 --> 138.64
yeah during the mornings when i was

136.959 --> 141.84
still trying to sleep

138.64 --> 144.55999999999997
just very warm in here so

141.84 --> 145.599
yeah this weather keeps up i am going to

144.56 --> 148.4
have to

145.599 --> 150.319
absolutely go to bed early or i'm gonna

148.4 --> 155.20000000000002
have

150.319 --> 155.2
just i'm gonna not be as restful

155.36 --> 165.04000000000002
right so it's the 30th

158.879 --> 165.04
of march on the tuesday 2021

166.959 --> 171.84
and yeah sorry for being a little late

177.84 --> 182.64000000000001
all right so yesterday

181.03 --> 185.84
[Music]

182.64 --> 185.83999999999997
yesterday was a mess

187.12 --> 196.239
it's very messy that

190.959 --> 196.239
yeah i was just really freaking grumpy

196.48 --> 199.92
and that carried on even into the flat

198.879 --> 203.76
earth

199.92 --> 203.76
debates so it seemed

204.08 --> 208.239
hello cameron kamikaze gilmore good to

206.959 --> 210.56
see you in chat

208.239 --> 210.56
first

211.519 --> 216.4
but yeah apparently yesterday while i

213.84 --> 216.4
was being

217.36 --> 221.36
a bit of a negative nancy i guess

222.64 --> 227.599
yeah merle apparently came by in the

225.44 --> 229.519
chat i didn't notice or i thought it was

227.599 --> 231.11999999999998
some sock account or something

229.519 --> 233.439
because it was in the middle of trolling

231.12 --> 234.72
but i banned him apparently and it was

233.439 --> 237.519
really him

234.72 --> 238.959
that's why he spent like half an hour

237.519 --> 241.36
during the flat earth debates

238.959 --> 244.72
complaining to me about it

241.36 --> 248.959
like i owed him something

244.72 --> 252.959
and like continued to add on me

248.959 --> 256.159
and yeah i was blatantly obvious

252.959 --> 256.159
not in the mood for that

257.519 --> 260.88
so i basically gave him a very rough

259.519 --> 264.639
analysis as i

260.88 --> 264.639
would do and it's not the first time

265.759 --> 271.44
but yeah that that really didn't look

268.639 --> 271.44
all that great

272.0 --> 283.36
so yesterday was pretty much a mess in

274.479 --> 285.68
many ways

283.36 --> 285.68
ah

289.28 --> 294.23999999999995
despite that though my shoulder is doing

291.52 --> 294.24
a little better

294.479 --> 298.4
barely bothered me this night

301.919 --> 306.479
so maybe yesterday is kind of the start

304.56 --> 310.72
of a process where i'm

306.479 --> 314.96
kind of trying to break free

310.72 --> 314.96000000000004
some of the weight that i'm carrying

320.72 --> 326.96000000000004
because yeah when i start to dream walk

324.56 --> 328.08
do that a lot and then hang on to it at

326.96 --> 329.919
some point

328.08 --> 332.639
it's like the weight of it is

329.919 --> 332.639
significant

334.0 --> 338.0
and the problem is once it yeah at some

337.44 --> 341.12
point

338.0 --> 344.32
like the weight only grows until i

341.12 --> 347.68
drop it right but when i drop it i also

344.32 --> 351.36
lose focus so it's like

347.68 --> 354.24
something like my subconscious has to

351.36 --> 356.47900000000004
figure out how to tactically deal with

354.24 --> 356.479
that

358.4 --> 362.79999999999995
because it's not just like oh i know i

361.52 --> 366.08
just do this

362.8 --> 367.44
and then then it's all right because the

366.08 --> 370.71999999999997
mechanics

367.44 --> 373.84
no with me

370.72 --> 376.319
it's rarely that simple

373.84 --> 379.35999999999996
and if it is it'll be revealed like in

376.319 --> 384.0
the very moment of realization

379.36 --> 384.0
and usually be applied very quickly

384.24 --> 388.08
but ah yeah

388.24 --> 392.40000000000003
yesterday was after the flat earth

390.88 --> 394.639
debate

392.4 --> 397.52
with which went on very long by the way

394.639 --> 397.52
in the aftershow

398.4 --> 404.08
uh was in there yeah it ended up like

401.919 --> 408.79999999999995
with a kumu virus

404.08 --> 411.44
being all double speaky

408.8 --> 413.36
so yeah we'll see that back on the on

411.44 --> 416.96
the premiere when is that going to be

413.36 --> 420.319
probably on

416.96 --> 422.79999999999995
thursday or something right

420.319 --> 426.639
anyway uh yeah owen benjamin also was

422.8 --> 426.639
live on tea time with gary and terry

426.88 --> 429.52
good stuff

430.88 --> 437.84
like that definitely helped distract me

449.199 --> 453.52000000000004
yeah and it would just it's just

451.759 --> 456.24
interesting to see how

453.52 --> 459.19899999999996
how the guy basically deals with

456.24 --> 463.039
energies and situations and spirits

459.199 --> 466.08000000000004
and yeah like he was really

463.039 --> 467.599
on inform well he he almost always is

466.08 --> 470.31899999999996
informed but yesterday just

467.599 --> 470.319
really showed

471.36 --> 474.47900000000004
and uh in a weird way gave my

473.68 --> 476.56
subconscious

474.479 --> 479.44
message like yeah there's people that

476.56 --> 483.599
can definitely control this

479.44 --> 483.599
don't worry it's not all up to you

487.52 --> 489.84
right

491.759 --> 498.319
anyway is there anybody else in here

494.08 --> 498.31899999999996
besides cameron kamigaza gilmore

498.96 --> 502.63899999999995
it's already evening in the show

504.84 --> 510.0
background

507.44 --> 510.0
green tea

511.52 --> 521.8389999999999
let's see

532.839 --> 538.8000000000001
uh

535.519 --> 538.8
what else is going on

539.68 --> 545.1999999999999
don't yeah i didn't like go to 24 7

543.6 --> 549.839
discord i think

545.2 --> 549.839
not that i can remember anyway

552.24 --> 558.5600000000001
oh yeah i watched vanilla sky i remember

555.44 --> 558.5600000000001
we're talking about it

559.44 --> 562.72
and it had been a long while since i

561.44 --> 565.519
watched that

562.72 --> 565.519
so i did that

570.64 --> 577.12
yeah that's pretty intense or pretty

573.68 --> 579.3599999999999
tense movie just so much tension in

577.12 --> 579.36
there

584.48 --> 588.72
hey secret asian man good to see you in

588.839 --> 595.0400000000001
chat

590.8 --> 597.1999999999999
i just put a a bowl of water out there

595.04 --> 599.8389999999999
for the birds and like it's already

597.2 --> 602.0
splashed all over the place so

599.839 --> 606.9590000000001
yeah with this heat the birds definitely

602.0 --> 606.959
are looking for water to get all splashy

607.92 --> 611.1999999999999
also this evening for me is going to be

609.92 --> 612.52
a nice cooking

611.2 --> 614.24
evening

612.52 --> 616.16
[Music]

614.24 --> 619.839
i'm going to probably do that even

616.16 --> 619.8389999999999
during the flat earth debates in between

623.44 --> 627.519
because i'm gonna make something really

625.2 --> 627.519
nice

629.36 --> 635.519
like uh

632.399 --> 638.32
chicken ginger

635.519 --> 638.32
rice and

639.44 --> 642.399
yeah like

645.04 --> 653.68
it's it's type of uh like a indonesian

649.6 --> 656.399
inspired type of meal

653.68 --> 658.16
but yeah it like the way it's made it

656.399 --> 660.0
it's definitely more like a family

658.16 --> 662.16
recipe but anyway i'm gonna make

660.0 --> 663.68
that already in the process of the

662.16 --> 665.519
preparation of it

663.68 --> 667.04
starting last night and really looking

665.519 --> 668.0
forward to it because it's been like

667.04 --> 670.24
over

668.0 --> 673.279
almost i think two freaking years since

670.24 --> 673.279
i last ate that

673.76 --> 677.04
like a long time ago

685.76 --> 690.48

688.56 --> 693.04
only

690.48 --> 693.04

693.839 --> 702.1600000000001
huh no wonder let me yeah i didn't

697.2 --> 704.0790000000001
realize that that it was still stuck two

702.16 --> 706.16
members only

704.079 --> 709.68
i did change that yesterday to kind of

706.16 --> 709.68
get rid of the trolls

714.32 --> 718.88
yeah it's still members only okay let me

716.24 --> 718.88
turn that off

719.76 --> 726.399
so some other people can say hello

723.279 --> 731.8389999999999
and hey if they start nagging me again

726.399 --> 731.839
or something i'll turn it back on

733.44 --> 735.7600000000001
all right

736.56 --> 739.5189999999999
i didn't even see it

740.16 --> 745.8389999999999
so anyway hello terror306 ah rob h

745.92 --> 751.519
fallon buchanan oris

751.639 --> 759.839
ovitagen tom parker

760.8 --> 773.8389999999999
iron if he

779.0 --> 782.1
[Music]

784.839 --> 787.839
oh

788.44 --> 792.109
[Music]

796.079 --> 814.88
so how are you guys doing i'm

799.279 --> 817.76
doing better

814.88 --> 819.12
i'm noticing that like whatever this is

817.76 --> 822.16
the

819.12 --> 824.24
mood i'm in it's like very much

822.16 --> 827.68
distracting me

824.24 --> 832.0
it has been overall

827.68 --> 832.0
from flat earth focusing i don't know

836.48 --> 838.72
so

841.6 --> 844.9590000000001
i'm doing my best though

849.279 --> 853.12
maybe it's also just because

854.24 --> 857.6
when it comes to yeah flatter

856.24 --> 860.399
development at this point

857.6 --> 861.9200000000001
it's it's kind of like fishing for

860.399 --> 864.959
scraps

861.92 --> 866.4799999999999
because we we pretty much all together

864.959 --> 870.0
got everything

866.48 --> 873.519
some people are just refining

870.0 --> 874.8
details just to get the the processes

873.519 --> 878.0
cleared up

874.8 --> 880.0
it's not really my thing like unless i'm

878.0 --> 882.56
get spontaneously inspired to do it in

880.0 --> 882.56
the moment

882.839 --> 887.9200000000001
uh but

884.48 --> 890.32
yeah there's no like loose ends

887.92 --> 891.12
except for those that we can't really

890.32 --> 892.88
test

891.12 --> 895.68
like hey what's the origin of the

892.88 --> 897.8389999999999
celestial light

895.68 --> 899.68
how is that manifesting that's kind of a

897.839 --> 901.1990000000001
mystery meteors is still kind of a

899.68 --> 905.68
mystery

901.199 --> 907.92
like how does lava from volcanoes

905.68 --> 913.8389999999999
how does that actually come into being

907.92 --> 913.8389999999999
these types of things

917.6 --> 927.839
but yeah there's just very little we can

920.16 --> 927.8389999999999
do about it

929.839 --> 940.0790000000001
steve sure has been quite lately any

932.399 --> 943.199
idea what he's up to i don't know

940.079 --> 943.199
uh yeah you're right

944.48 --> 949.519
but i think like which steve you mean

947.36 --> 952.839
good servant steve

949.519 --> 956.079
like i know quite a few stevens now here

952.839 --> 957.36
through through my experiences here on

956.079 --> 960.4799999999999
youtube

957.36 --> 962.8000000000001
like at least

960.48 --> 962.8000000000001
four

963.87 --> 969.36
[Music]

965.759 --> 973.44
all right so but i don't know like

969.36 --> 973.44
to be fair i don't really keep track of

973.81 --> 977.02
[Music]

980.839 --> 983.839
everybody

1001.04 --> 1008.8389999999999
i saw white sun yesterday have you seen

1004.8 --> 1011.04
white sun what what do you mean white

1008.839 --> 1015.1990000000001
sun

1011.04 --> 1015.199
i don't know what that means terra 306

1023.12 --> 1026.64
i don't know i've seen the sun

1026.799 --> 1030.24
giving out all kinds of input and

1029.199 --> 1033.3600000000001
depending on

1030.24 --> 1037.76
like what yeah what's

1033.36 --> 1041.12
in between like

1037.76 --> 1041.12
particles or whatever

1042.799 --> 1046.24
yeah the sun can seem pretty white at

1045.039 --> 1048.64
times so

1046.24 --> 1049.6
i don't see the point yeah full moon

1048.64 --> 1051.5200000000002
yesterday

1049.6 --> 1052.6399999999999
well maybe that was it maybe that was

1051.52 --> 1056.96
what drives me

1052.64 --> 1056.96
was literally driving me nuts at times

1058.08 --> 1064.0
because i did notice that

1061.2 --> 1064.8400000000001
so maybe now it's finally kinda gonna

1064.0 --> 1067.84
let me go

1064.84 --> 1067.84
again

1077.2 --> 1081.8400000000001
or during sunset okay

1086.88 --> 1095.8400000000001
yeah that that may be yeah that could be

1089.2 --> 1095.8400000000001
considered a little odd i don't know

1106.72 --> 1123.84
no i have not watched the series equinox

1125.73 --> 1128.809
[Music]

1131.73 --> 1134.789
[Music]

1146.24 --> 1149.6
kind of out there well there's a whole

1147.919 --> 1150.16
bunch of those types of things that are

1149.6 --> 1153.4399999999998
totally

1150.16 --> 1155.679
out there kind of out there i don't know

1153.44 --> 1165.8400000000001
man

1155.679 --> 1165.8400000000001
i'm taking it easy on the new series

1166.4 --> 1170.96
maybe i'll check it out at some point

1168.16 --> 1173.28
but yeah after behind her eyes i kind of

1170.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
like felt like okay i've had enough of

1173.28 --> 1179.84
this [ __ ] for a while

1187.039 --> 1194.4
ravage what have you seen jay toten's

1190.559 --> 1194.3999999999999
latest video no i have not

1195.2 --> 1207.8400000000001
who is that exactly

1209.84 --> 1221.84
like j told in media

1226.799 --> 1238.08
take it you mean that one

1234.08 --> 1238.08
yeah well i haven't seen it so

1244.08 --> 1247.84
what's the difference in distance to the

1246.72 --> 1252.159
sun

1247.84 --> 1257.28
winter and summer in the heliocentric

1252.159 --> 1257.2800000000002
okay uh well nothing

1259.36 --> 1266.0
winter and summer is supposed to be

1263.2 --> 1266.72
at one distance within the presupposed

1266.0 --> 1269.919
orbit

1266.72 --> 1273.3600000000001
oval orbit around the sun

1269.919 --> 1276.7990000000002
and spring and autumn

1273.36 --> 1279.1999999999998
are in the other distance

1276.799 --> 1279.9189999999999
so yeah that's supposed to be but that

1279.2 --> 1284.559
doesn't

1279.919 --> 1284.5590000000002
yeah that's not based on anything real

1288.84 --> 1291.84
so

1300.96 --> 1319.8400000000001
modus tollens anger bro what the hell

1304.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
does that mean

1358.159 --> 1364.48
all right i'm just going through that

1361.919 --> 1367.1200000000001
video of the secrets of the california

1364.48 --> 1367.1200000000001
aqueduct

1372.799 --> 1378.559
yeah without volume i don't yet

1376.72 --> 1380.96
don't really understand what this is

1378.559 --> 1384.08
about

1380.96 --> 1385.679
i think it's about the flatness of water

1384.08 --> 1389.84
i think

1385.679 --> 1389.8400000000001
i don't know i'm not sure

1400.88 --> 1404.3200000000002
well it makes sense though within

1402.48 --> 1408.4
without all aqueducts

1404.32 --> 1410.96
it's basically a steel water thing

1408.4 --> 1414.8400000000001
and yeah it's gonna rise and fall

1410.96 --> 1416.72
depending on the amount of water in

1414.84 --> 1418.8799999999999
there

1416.72 --> 1420.159
and it's all very level and i think

1418.88 --> 1423.919
probably

1420.159 --> 1427.7600000000002
aqueducts like that or aquifers

1423.919 --> 1431.8400000000001
really show how level the water is

1427.76 --> 1431.84
so maybe the video is about that anyway

1432.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
hello shatner's bassoon

1457.84 --> 1473.84
about no earth curvature okay right

1476.799 --> 1479.2
gates

1483.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
what do you mean ravage gates too

1526.84 --> 1534.3999999999999
what are you talking about tara 306

1530.559 --> 1536.559
3 million miles what 3 million miles

1534.4 --> 1539.279
what

1536.559 --> 1540.84
oh the supposed distance to the sun

1539.279 --> 1543.84
again

1540.84 --> 1543.84
right

1547.919 --> 1551.2
yesterday you were hearing a crazy

1550.24 --> 1557.84
basque

1551.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
buzz in my sound ask and receive

1561.6 --> 1563.9189999999999
huh

1565.6 --> 1569.12
i don't know it might have been just

1567.36 --> 1572.32
people

1569.12 --> 1576.0
like were working in that

1572.32 --> 1577.6789999999999
day yesterday a lot so people

1576.0 --> 1579.52
i don't know somebody was drilling

1577.679 --> 1581.6000000000001
inside of the concrete of the building

1579.52 --> 1585.57
somewhere or something like that

1581.6 --> 1588.6999999999998
so that's what you might have picked up

1585.57 --> 1588.7
[Music]

1597.52 --> 1601.84
no curve inside hello seeking star water

1611.44 --> 1615.2
oh the window washers yeah yeah

1616.4 --> 1620.799
yeah they were busy like up until the

1618.48 --> 1620.799
evening

1624.08 --> 1627.12
that's weird that that the mic picked

1626.24 --> 1630.96
that up

1627.12 --> 1630.9599999999998
like i was barely bothered by it

1633.039 --> 1638.32
at least and yeah until

1636.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
after the point that i figured out like

1638.32 --> 1641.84
what it was actually but

1647.279 --> 1653.12
right anyway yeah how are you all doing

1651.039 --> 1669.84
i hope the weather is as beautiful over

1653.12 --> 1669.84
there as it is here

1694.84 --> 1697.84
ah

1722.84 --> 1725.84
so

1741.76 --> 1745.44
oh yeah yeah brandon was also alive

1744.32 --> 1747.6
yesterday but i

1745.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
completely missed out i was watching

1747.6 --> 1753.84
vanilla sky

1770.399 --> 1780.2399999999998
all right hey sleeping warrior good to

1773.44 --> 1782.559
see you

1780.24 --> 1782.559
what

1785.6 --> 1789.36
that's so funny you were gonna say that

1787.44 --> 1792.159
because i was about to bring up

1789.36 --> 1795.52
something related

1792.159 --> 1799.279
like i heard that i wasn't sure

1795.52 --> 1802.08
like i'm not getting too

1799.279 --> 1802.399
riled up about things like that unlike

1802.08 --> 1806.24
you

1802.399 --> 1808.2399999999998
tony but i heard that david weiss is

1806.24 --> 1811.6
apparently now on the

1808.24 --> 1814.72
incoherent dielectric acceleration

1811.6 --> 1814.7199999999998
bandwagon as well

1815.039 --> 1822.399
at least he is referencing that

1819.039 --> 1826.399
i don't know i i haven't noticed it

1822.399 --> 1829.1999999999998
then again i don't really watch every

1826.399 --> 1829.6789999999999
video that if it was does i just know

1829.2 --> 1832.559
he's

1829.679 --> 1834.3990000000001
doing a lot of things and connecting and

1832.559 --> 1838.24
overall like the guy

1834.399 --> 1840.9599999999998
we go way back like when i was

1838.24 --> 1842.159
still starting up wanting to do my own

1840.96 --> 1843.8400000000001
thing

1842.159 --> 1846.0
like he kind of helped me out and

1843.84 --> 1847.9189999999999
encouraged me on a personal level and i

1846.0 --> 1850.48
really appreciate that

1847.919 --> 1852.72
i hope he's not sorry about that not

1850.48 --> 1854.88
just kidding

1852.72 --> 1857.1200000000001
but i am a little bit of a handful i

1854.88 --> 1857.1200000000001
know

1861.679 --> 1868.48
but uh yeah this

1865.6 --> 1879.84
downward bias thing is not going away

1868.48 --> 1879.84
that easily

1883.76 --> 1891.6
oh right oh wakey wakey's fit new video

1888.559 --> 1895.44
okay well when is when is out

1891.6 --> 1898.1589999999999
make sure to put the link in chat here

1895.44 --> 1901.279
that will be great because he's not on

1898.159 --> 1901.279
youtube anymore right

1901.36 --> 1907.84
i don't really check out most of the

1903.2 --> 1907.8400000000001
other platforms

1912.72 --> 1919.2
well sleeping warrior why do you think

1915.84 --> 1922.0
come on it's

1919.2 --> 1923.279
it's just the reason as to why he's on

1922.0 --> 1926.32
the disk

1923.279 --> 1928.96
like he's going for like

1926.32 --> 1931.279
the easily as he's going for the

1928.96 --> 1935.2
assembly

1931.279 --> 1938.48
the assimilation route instead of the

1935.2 --> 1940.96
cold hard facts route he's going for

1938.48 --> 1942.08
a replacement model because that works

1940.96 --> 1945.039
for more people

1942.08 --> 1945.84
quicker it's the same reason mark

1945.039 --> 1950.24
sergeant

1945.84 --> 1953.6
basically just iconic iconographized

1950.24 --> 1956.32
the disc model even though he says

1953.6 --> 1956.6399999999999
like yeah it's impre we don't know for

1956.32 --> 1958.48
sure

1956.64 --> 1961.519
if it's literally that and all that

1958.48 --> 1965.279
right he still uses it and i think that

1961.519 --> 1965.279
david weiss is just like that

1966.0 --> 1972.96
he's aiming wide so then

1969.919 --> 1976.0
yeah these oversimplification

1972.96 --> 1978.29
steps kind of do come

1976.0 --> 1981.359
to hand

1978.29 --> 1981.359
[Music]

1982.0 --> 1987.6
now with the downward bias thing yeah

1984.24 --> 1990.72
it's a little difficult but it's not

1987.6 --> 1993.84
strange to imagine that a lot of people

1990.72 --> 1994.64
breaking free from heliocentric nonsense

1993.84 --> 1996.9599999999998
in this

1994.64 --> 2000.5590000000002
trying to figure it out they have the

1996.96 --> 2002.72
child's curiosity basically reopened

2000.559 --> 2004.08
right in the process and then it's like

2002.72 --> 2007.44
oh but why

2004.08 --> 2010.32
the directions oh yeah and then you can

2007.44 --> 2013.039
endlessly fantasize about

2010.32 --> 2014.48
what is gravity try to figure out the

2013.039 --> 2017.679
aberration

2014.48 --> 2019.6
right some kind of cause thing

2017.679 --> 2020.88
and that's an endless process that can

2019.6 --> 2022.559
never be resolved

2020.88 --> 2024.3200000000002
that's why i've called it an aberration

2022.559 --> 2027.6789999999999
and left it to that

2024.32 --> 2030.0
but yeah people can typically

2027.679 --> 2033.519
pick that up as a play thing and then

2030.0 --> 2037.2
play with it for a very long time

2033.519 --> 2037.2
and i think that's why people do it

2037.84 --> 2042.08
and why it's even kind of been

2040.159 --> 2047.519
popularized somewhat

2042.08 --> 2050.879
even though it is just a mess

2047.519 --> 2061.839
because people can then just

2050.879 --> 2061.839
start imagining again right

2067.119 --> 2070.96
why things fall is a stupid question no

2070.079 --> 2075.679
it's not

2070.96 --> 2078.0
it's relative density

2075.679 --> 2078.8
like all of it is completely accounted

2078.0 --> 2081.359
for every

2078.8 --> 2081.3590000000004
every part

2082.48 --> 2090.0
it's just that yeah the causal relation

2086.8 --> 2090.8
and the results of any setup through

2090.0 --> 2093.359
entropy

2090.8 --> 2096.32
is apparent it's clear through relative

2093.359 --> 2099.44
density it's just that people

2096.32 --> 2101.52
can't stop asking why but why

2099.44 --> 2105.28
right the six-year-old that's awaken

2101.52 --> 2105.28
again and they can't leave it alone

2108.96 --> 2113.2
and so people will at some point then

2111.839 --> 2115.599
just start dwelling

2113.2 --> 2116.8799999999997
on aberrations that can be resolved and

2115.599 --> 2119.3590000000004
then get

2116.88 --> 2121.52
maybe obsessed with it or just hang on

2119.359 --> 2123.68
to it for a very long time

2121.52 --> 2125.2
some virtual thing that they can't

2123.68 --> 2126.72
really prove

2125.2 --> 2128.24
and then they'll get taken really

2126.72 --> 2131.839
personal right

2128.24 --> 2131.839
it's what people do

2142.32 --> 2146.2400000000002
hey mandy young by the way good to see

2144.079 --> 2146.2400000000002
you

2151.119 --> 2159.839
batman for never

2164.24 --> 2168.24
it's been a while since i saw you in

2170.839 --> 2173.839
here

2181.68 --> 2191.04
it's stupid imagination

2187.44 --> 2194.8
yeah maybe it's just like

2191.04 --> 2198.96
why why the directions why is it

2194.8 --> 2202.079
it's a question why the setup like this

2198.96 --> 2204.88
why that and it's not a

2202.079 --> 2206.4
logical question to ask it's just a

2204.88 --> 2208.7200000000003
question

2206.4 --> 2208.7200000000003
that's

2209.44 --> 2215.119
very unlikely to ever be resolved

2213.92 --> 2218.48
because

2215.119 --> 2221.76
yeah what what what is there

2218.48 --> 2226.0
that is unmeasurable has

2221.76 --> 2230.079
infinite or yeah limitless reach

2226.0 --> 2232.96
completely independent on medium

2230.079 --> 2234.079
on the content of the medium and yeah

2232.96 --> 2239.119
could apply this

2234.079 --> 2241.28
steady a in unmeasurable slight force

2239.119 --> 2242.32
in the real world right that there is no

2241.28 --> 2244.96
such thing

2242.32 --> 2244.96
like it

2250.4 --> 2256.4
it bypasses and completely leaves in the

2253.76 --> 2260.1600000000003
dust every known conceptions

2256.4 --> 2263.28
of force application

2260.16 --> 2266.56
in in physics right that's the issue

2263.28 --> 2270.48
is that gravity is just an aberration

2266.56 --> 2275.2
it really really is the concept of it

2270.48 --> 2275.2
an unresolved mystery the alignment

2275.359 --> 2281.5989999999997
and yeah you can imagine

2278.4 --> 2284.1600000000003
that there's this force field happening

2281.599 --> 2285.92
and the problem is it's much easier to

2284.16 --> 2288.16
imagine this

2285.92 --> 2289.6800000000003
than to actually find some real thing in

2288.16 --> 2292.3999999999996
the world so it's a yeah

2289.68 --> 2293.7599999999998
and a ghost an aberration the suggestion

2292.4 --> 2296.48
is very heavy

2293.76 --> 2297.599
you'll stumble upon it one way or the

2296.48 --> 2300.0
other

2297.599 --> 2302.48
if once you start figuring things out

2300.0 --> 2304.32
you're going to stumble on it

2302.48 --> 2305.52
upon it that's why i call it an

2304.32 --> 2308.48
aberration

2305.52 --> 2309.68
you can't resolve it it's like a ghost

2308.48 --> 2312.96
it's a ghost

2309.68 --> 2313.359
that finds you and if you don't watch

2312.96 --> 2315.28
out

2313.359 --> 2316.64
you're gonna believe in it even though

2315.28 --> 2319.6800000000003
you'll never find

2316.64 --> 2320.0789999999997
any physical connection and then you

2319.68 --> 2322.64
might

2320.079 --> 2327.8390000000004
start reifying it anyway and then you

2322.64 --> 2327.839
got a problem

2333.92 --> 2339.119
i hope people realize that you know when

2336.72 --> 2339.4399999999996
when the gravity debate was going with

2339.119 --> 2343.44
me

2339.44 --> 2345.839
and tony when i rounded it out

2343.44 --> 2348.2400000000002
and everybody was sort of a bit giggly

2345.839 --> 2351.2
and [ __ ] about it i was in a very

2348.24 --> 2353.359
pressed mood but when i started calling

2351.2 --> 2356.3999999999996
it an aberration

2353.359 --> 2358.64
that wasn't just some artsy thing i was

2356.4 --> 2362.64
doing i was really trying to put it down

2358.64 --> 2365.2
as like no this is really an aberration

2362.64 --> 2365.839
like i'm absolutely sure because it's

2365.2 --> 2369.2
like the

2365.839 --> 2371.359
the nth time i've bumped into this

2369.2 --> 2374.48
and no matter the perspective it always

2371.359 --> 2377.5989999999997
ends up in the same place

2374.48 --> 2380.64
a force that completely defies

2377.599 --> 2383.6800000000003
all known forces

2380.64 --> 2385.839
that you can pinpoint that you could

2383.68 --> 2387.359
imagine to technically be there in order

2385.839 --> 2389.839
to explain the alignment

2387.359 --> 2389.839
that's it

2390.48 --> 2394.16
and that's like what is it three years

2392.4 --> 2396.56
ago four years ago oh god

2394.16 --> 2397.92
time's flying so three years ago or

2396.56 --> 2401.359
something

2397.92 --> 2404.079
and look at look at the community now

2401.359 --> 2405.04
a whole bunch of people now got no

2404.079 --> 2407.3590000000004
dielectric

2405.04 --> 2408.16
acceleration all this almost

2407.359 --> 2411.2799999999997
immeasurable

2408.16 --> 2414.56
it's the whole gravity [ __ ] excuse

2411.28 --> 2417.3590000000004
line up once again same lineup ballers

2414.56 --> 2420.0789999999997
use for their gravity

2417.359 --> 2422.4
is being used in argumentation for the

2420.079 --> 2425.92
incoherent dielectric acceleration

2422.4 --> 2429.04
blah blah blah it's exactly the same

2425.92 --> 2430.8
excuse process it's baller behavior it's

2429.04 --> 2434.16
the same

2430.8 --> 2436.319
religious reifying system

2434.16 --> 2437.44
the same results the same spirit

2436.319 --> 2439.599
response to

2437.44 --> 2442.64
latching onto that it's happening all

2439.599 --> 2442.6400000000003
over again people

2445.04 --> 2450.4
and one by one they succumb

2448.16 --> 2451.2799999999997
they latch onto it and then they model

2450.4 --> 2453.92
it and they

2451.28 --> 2456.079
visualize it they assist the spell the

2453.92 --> 2458.7200000000003
reification the imagination

2456.079 --> 2458.7200000000003
of it

2459.2 --> 2467.52
and very bad things happen

2463.44 --> 2471.92
people literally try to fool

2467.52 --> 2474.8
things like fool people into believing

2471.92 --> 2476.56
specific detailed things happen that

2474.8 --> 2481.28
don't happen in order

2476.56 --> 2485.68
to mend the seam

2481.28 --> 2487.92
of the concept in reality

2485.68 --> 2488.96
so they're starting to lie to reify it

2487.92 --> 2491.2000000000003
like i

2488.96 --> 2493.52
i'm merciless with this okay i'm not

2491.2 --> 2497.52
gonna let you go

2493.52 --> 2498.16
you do that you try to gaslight like oh

2497.52 --> 2501.28
no no

2498.16 --> 2504.64
you don't understand oh you're the one

2501.28 --> 2507.2000000000003
screw you you're a liar

2504.64 --> 2507.839
you're a fraud you engage in fraud for

2507.2 --> 2511.04
your

2507.839 --> 2513.2
religious reification of the aberration

2511.04 --> 2515.68
i tried to warn you about

2513.2 --> 2517.5989999999997
i tried to warn everybody about when

2515.68 --> 2523.839
they were still

2517.599 --> 2523.839
laughing at me right

2524.0 --> 2528.56
i'm just really glad that the people at

2527.2 --> 2530.72
the flat earth debates

2528.56 --> 2532.0
really get this and take it as serious

2530.72 --> 2535.359
as it is

2532.0 --> 2538.64
like this is this is spell

2535.359 --> 2541.92
warfare and there's a lot of threats

2538.64 --> 2543.839
people are starting to master words

2541.92 --> 2546.4
understanding and they are getting

2543.839 --> 2547.7599999999998
spellbounds by the natural effects that

2546.4 --> 2550.2400000000002
arise

2547.76 --> 2550.88
from the journey the aberrations that

2550.24 --> 2556.16
pop up

2550.88 --> 2556.1600000000003
always on the journey and it's happening

2559.2 --> 2564.0789999999997
oh why thank you cameron coming at you

2561.359 --> 2567.119
more yeah aberration

2564.079 --> 2570.079
like i really thought about

2567.119 --> 2571.92
which word to pick before picking it

2570.079 --> 2573.92
when i did that

2571.92 --> 2576.56
took some consideration looking up

2573.92 --> 2576.56
comparing

2577.76 --> 2584.48
and i call it an aberration because it's

2580.8 --> 2587.119
like a holographic thing almost

2584.48 --> 2588.4
so it's not a ghost a ghost is literally

2587.119 --> 2591.76
an echo of a

2588.4 --> 2595.76
of a spirit of a person of an

2591.76 --> 2599.28
impression right it's an aberration

2595.76 --> 2602.8
it's something that's not supposed to

2599.28 --> 2606.079
be there in the stability of things but

2602.8 --> 2608.5600000000004
it is there you always bump into

2606.079 --> 2610.079
it like a ghost or like a hologram you

2608.56 --> 2613.839
can never reach it's like the

2610.079 --> 2616.48
uncatchable dragon it's an aberration

2613.839 --> 2616.48
it's a thing

2616.64 --> 2623.92
like it's not a thing but it's a thing

2619.76 --> 2626.96
to us and it distracts you away

2623.92 --> 2629.04
from continuing the process of actually

2626.96 --> 2632.16
figuring out reality

2629.04 --> 2636.64
so i thought aberration was in a

2632.16 --> 2638.7999999999997
wide sense the best name to pick for it

2636.64 --> 2649.839
thank you for recognizing that cameron

2638.8 --> 2649.8390000000004
kamigaza gilmore

2652.24 --> 2656.8799999999997
all right now i never expected people to

2654.16 --> 2659.52
start al also like me call it an

2656.88 --> 2659.52
aberration

2660.24 --> 2665.52
but maybe later when the entire

2663.04 --> 2668.079
development process the psychology

2665.52 --> 2669.7599999999998
development of everybody multiple layers

2668.079 --> 2672.96
getting it at multiple

2669.76 --> 2675.44
time intervals i think that eventually

2672.96 --> 2676.8
the recognition for gravity being an

2675.44 --> 2680.7200000000003
aberration

2676.8 --> 2684.2400000000002
just like like being a wave

2680.72 --> 2684.64
ether being an aberration i think people

2684.24 --> 2687.5989999999997
will

2684.64 --> 2690.0
over time learn to appreciate using that

2687.599 --> 2691.76
description for it more and more because

2690.0 --> 2694.88
they will

2691.76 --> 2694.88
start to understand

2695.599 --> 2701.28
right this always happened remember i

2698.8 --> 2701.28
remember

2702.079 --> 2706.48
i'm getting old remember in your early

2704.96 --> 2709.04
days

2706.48 --> 2711.28
everybody still was trying to figure out

2709.04 --> 2713.119
oh the sun what is the distance of the

2711.28 --> 2716.0
sun it's moving over a disk

2713.119 --> 2716.839
look the triangulation it works out with

2716.0 --> 2720.079
this

2716.839 --> 2723.119
disk and i'm like no it's holographic

2720.079 --> 2726.5600000000004
and everybody's like okay

2723.119 --> 2728.2400000000002
ah you're just as nutty as peachy

2726.56 --> 2729.7599999999998
and i was like no no it's holographic

2728.24 --> 2730.839
let me try to explain and everybody's

2729.76 --> 2733.92
just like

2730.839 --> 2737.52
uh yeah

2733.92 --> 2740.56
yeah well that took

2737.52 --> 2743.359
better part of four years in total

2740.56 --> 2744.16
before it started to become an

2743.359 --> 2748.0
understood

2744.16 --> 2751.44
thing like in all circles

2748.0 --> 2753.599
and i'm really happy it did

2751.44 --> 2754.48
because it's very important it's

2753.599 --> 2757.599
important

2754.48 --> 2761.599
for your mind to be able to switch

2757.599 --> 2763.599
that off the physicality assumption bias

2761.599 --> 2767.119
that's keeping us stuck

2763.599 --> 2770.2400000000002
in the outer space field with balls

2767.119 --> 2772.56
imagination world it's all based on

2770.24 --> 2774.4799999999996
physicality assumption bias

2772.56 --> 2778.319
on that process as soon as you see

2774.48 --> 2780.079
something you imagine it's physical

2778.319 --> 2782.48
because that's the first thing you could

2780.079 --> 2782.48
think of

2782.72 --> 2789.839
it's the most at hand

2785.839 --> 2792.0789999999997
explanation even for your subconscious

2789.839 --> 2793.119
until you take control of the process

2792.079 --> 2797.28
and realize like

2793.119 --> 2799.839
no wait it could be something else

2797.28 --> 2802.2400000000002
to really be sure you need to test it

2799.839 --> 2807.7599999999998
and you need to understand

2802.24 --> 2807.7599999999998
what it means for things to be physical

2807.839 --> 2813.52
for your observations and then

2811.44 --> 2817.04
you can slowly get rid of the

2813.52 --> 2820.079
physicality assumption by as a reflex

2817.04 --> 2822.16
and replace it with

2820.079 --> 2824.48
understanding of how other people

2822.16 --> 2826.72
quickly still engage in that process

2824.48 --> 2830.0
and it's very hard for them to overcome

2826.72 --> 2833.04
they don't see it yet

2830.0 --> 2834.8
and that you can see it as well this

2833.04 --> 2835.599
evidence is missing that evidence is

2834.8 --> 2838.8
missing

2835.599 --> 2840.6400000000003
so we could like model

2838.8 --> 2842.079
certain concepts into it like a

2840.64 --> 2845.359
holographic nature but

2842.079 --> 2847.76
yeah without a pinpointable

2845.359 --> 2850.319
source where it's actually coming from

2847.76 --> 2853.5200000000004
that remains

2850.319 --> 2853.92
quite elusive even though it's right

2853.52 --> 2859.839
there

2853.92 --> 2859.839
at all times

2860.64 --> 2864.5589999999997
yeah seeking star wars look but peach

2862.96 --> 2867.76
cheese ideas

2864.559 --> 2868.2400000000002
yeah he blocked me too like even he's

2867.76 --> 2871.0400000000004
blocked

2868.24 --> 2873.2799999999997
everybody that guy's just i don't know

2871.04 --> 2876.8
what's wrong with him

2873.28 --> 2879.28
but yeah his ideas were kind of

2876.8 --> 2880.8
interesting because these ideas he still

2879.28 --> 2883.92
spams in chat

2880.8 --> 2885.28
sometimes those are ideas he came up

2883.92 --> 2888.48
with five years ago

2885.28 --> 2892.48
and six years ago he's just

2888.48 --> 2893.68
never really developed any solid

2892.48 --> 2896.0
structure

2893.68 --> 2897.2
for his story he never really developed

2896.0 --> 2901.359
a story for it

2897.2 --> 2902.96
it's just some ingredients and he

2901.359 --> 2906.5589999999997
roughly mixes it together

2902.96 --> 2909.2
improvisingly never he never

2906.559 --> 2912.4
pinned down anything he never tried to

2909.2 --> 2912.3999999999996
really make it real

2913.52 --> 2920.319
try to keep it fluid

2916.96 --> 2922.319
which makes it effectively incoherent

2920.319 --> 2925.92
it's not it's just a dream castle it's

2922.319 --> 2928.319
literally dream castle in the clouds

2925.92 --> 2929.839
and then he makes you try to focus on

2928.319 --> 2933.44
that and as you engage

2929.839 --> 2936.0
he then drops it he just drops it says

2933.44 --> 2937.2000000000003
oh look see everything is possible oh

2936.0 --> 2940.319
it's all connected

2937.2 --> 2940.839
that [ __ ] right so he's taking you away

2940.319 --> 2944.16
from

2940.839 --> 2946.24
physical analysis

2944.16 --> 2947.5989999999997
trying to figure things out into the

2946.24 --> 2950.72
ethereal

2947.599 --> 2952.48
nonsense world where just nothing

2950.72 --> 2953.7599999999998
matters anymore that's what he does

2952.48 --> 2956.0
every time

2953.76 --> 2958.1600000000003
it's a complete waste of time he's

2956.0 --> 2961.76
literally wasting his own

2958.16 --> 2961.7599999999998
insights on this [ __ ]

2963.28 --> 2969.92
he's been doing it for years now like

2966.76 --> 2970.7200000000003
consistently the same consistently the

2969.92 --> 2973.76
same

2970.72 --> 2976.319
he's actually grown worse

2973.76 --> 2977.3590000000004
more conspiracy nutty more about

2976.319 --> 2979.68
geomatria

2977.359 --> 2981.5989999999997
and synchronicities and oh look this

2979.68 --> 2982.48
word if you rearrange it like that then

2981.599 --> 2985.44
it means this

2982.48 --> 2986.0
it needs now constantly doing that he he

2985.44 --> 2990.0
wasn't

2986.0 --> 2993.119
as obsessed

2990.0 --> 2996.24
in his like conduct

2993.119 --> 2999.359
as he is right now four years ago

2996.24 --> 3001.9199999999996
he wasn't like that as much

2999.359 --> 3003.2
just had a lot of social issues bumping

3001.92 --> 3005.28
in with egos

3003.2 --> 3006.48
like he's always had issues with that

3005.28 --> 3009.92
doing his best

3006.48 --> 3013.839
to work on that but it seems like he's

3009.92 --> 3013.839
isolated himself more and more

3015.2 --> 3023.2799999999997
will peachey be back on fed no

3018.72 --> 3025.2
absolutely not dude

3023.28 --> 3027.52
like i think he's almost blocked

3025.2 --> 3031.52
everyone jared

3027.52 --> 3034.8
when you're blocking everyone

3031.52 --> 3037.44
you're not gonna go on somebody's show

3034.8 --> 3039.28
except to act the same way literally

3037.44 --> 3040.4
ignore everybody and effectively start

3039.28 --> 3043.2000000000003
trolling

3040.4 --> 3045.839
and everybody knows that especially

3043.2 --> 3045.839
nathan so

3046.319 --> 3049.92
he might give him a shot but i don't

3048.48 --> 3054.0
think pete's gonna take it

3049.92 --> 3057.44
pete knows

3054.0 --> 3057.44
like that his

3060.24 --> 3063.2799999999997
the mission the mission his ego is

3062.4 --> 3065.92
forcing me into

3063.28 --> 3066.6400000000003
is to no veil it's not gonna help he's

3065.92 --> 3069.599
not

3066.64 --> 3070.0789999999997
gonna ascend with that he knows it

3069.599 --> 3073.28
that's

3070.079 --> 3075.76
perhaps way so frustrated but enough

3073.28 --> 3075.76
of that

3080.88 --> 3084.7200000000003
if he's back ours targeted

3086.96 --> 3094.2400000000002
no territ it's look it's not even funny

3091.119 --> 3094.2400000000002
at this point okay

3095.52 --> 3101.28
every time you say that you you seem to

3098.88 --> 3101.92
or well maybe it's not a joke it's just

3101.28 --> 3104.4
that

3101.92 --> 3105.599
like it's very serious okay the guy's

3104.4 --> 3109.52
been saying that for

3105.599 --> 3112.8
freaking five years

3109.52 --> 3116.24
and he's never followed up on it okay

3112.8 --> 3119.44
that's like rumpus level promising to

3116.24 --> 3121.839
show you the the model that would

3119.44 --> 3123.2000000000003
account for terrestrial refraction in a

3121.839 --> 3125.359
certain sighting

3123.2 --> 3127.52
and it's now five years later and he

3125.359 --> 3130.0789999999997
still says yeah yeah i

3127.52 --> 3130.8
i'm i'm going to do it any moment okay

3130.079 --> 3133.599
it's

3130.8 --> 3135.44
preposterous it's not even a joke

3133.599 --> 3138.0
anymore to say that

3135.44 --> 3139.359
like he's never going to show you

3138.0 --> 3142.8
anything

3139.359 --> 3145.68
bt is never going to show you anything

3142.8 --> 3146.88
he's got nothing and he's not making

3145.68 --> 3149.9199999999996
anything

3146.88 --> 3153.119
he's just whole he's just being very

3149.92 --> 3154.319
primitive politician about it dangling

3153.119 --> 3157.119
this promise

3154.319 --> 3158.48
of a story never following up on it

3157.119 --> 3161.599
always driving you

3158.48 --> 3163.68
into ethereal nonsense

3161.599 --> 3165.6800000000003
and oh enjoy the freedom and everything

3163.68 --> 3167.52
is connecting and just like

3165.68 --> 3170.72
basically telling you just get really

3167.52 --> 3173.92
high and forget about it

3170.72 --> 3176.0
right don't recommend it and and i i

3173.92 --> 3178.079
wouldn't make fun of it either

3176.0 --> 3180.8
because this is like serious there this

3178.079 --> 3183.2000000000003
is a form of derangement

3180.8 --> 3183.2000000000003
okay

3188.16 --> 3195.839
dan gets sucked into which dan are you

3191.839 --> 3195.839
talking about sleeping warrior

3198.0 --> 3201.359
oh dan pratt i

3203.92 --> 3209.04
get sucked in yeah no [ __ ] dude

3207.04 --> 3223.839
does he ever get involved in anything

3209.04 --> 3223.839
else tony

3231.839 --> 3235.359
yeah what you just said mn makes no

3234.72 --> 3238.48
sense

3235.359 --> 3241.52
just warning you

3238.48 --> 3242.2400000000002
distances between cities only work on

3241.52 --> 3244.559
the globe

3242.24 --> 3244.5589999999997
why

3245.599 --> 3249.04
like why

3249.599 --> 3254.88
it's not even a lie it's just completely

3252.079 --> 3259.28
nonsensical seeking star wars

3254.88 --> 3261.52
like how makes no freaking sense to say

3259.28 --> 3261.52
this

3263.76 --> 3279.8390000000004
like i don't see the difference diff

3266.96 --> 3279.839
distance between cities really

3287.839 --> 3293.839
hello dr sailor

3304.319 --> 3308.72
i'm constructing a flat earth map

3309.359 --> 3316.4
why i know i know how it works i know

3312.72 --> 3316.3999999999996
it's based on the glow projection

3324.48 --> 3331.2
there's still a lot about it that's just

3328.16 --> 3333.04
very wrong though so this glow

3331.2 --> 3335.359
projection

3333.04 --> 3338.24
is incomplete and there's just things

3335.359 --> 3340.799
about it that are wrong

3338.24 --> 3342.72
if you're going to take antarctica as

3340.799 --> 3345.92
presented

3342.72 --> 3346.5589999999997
on the literal globe model it's just

3345.92 --> 3349.599
wrong

3346.559 --> 3352.7200000000003
completely wrong

3349.599 --> 3353.04
it's just not working so yeah it might

3352.72 --> 3356.0789999999997
be

3353.04 --> 3360.0
originally based on the globe projection

3356.079 --> 3363.6800000000003
that is wrong right the layout

3360.0 --> 3366.079
is incorrect so yeah the original glow

3363.68 --> 3371.52
projection on which the maps are based

3366.079 --> 3375.04
including the flat earth maps are wrong

3371.52 --> 3375.52
hello yeah the glow projection yeah it's

3375.04 --> 3377.839
wrong

3375.52 --> 3377.839
that's right

3378.72 --> 3383.52
but that's the foundation that we've

3380.799 --> 3388.16
been handed

3383.52 --> 3390.559
right so how is the actual layout

3388.16 --> 3393.5989999999997
i don't know there's still the

3390.559 --> 3396.88
orientation of antarctica

3393.599 --> 3400.88
so what is it when you go past

3396.88 --> 3403.599
the ice wall what will the gyroscope do

3400.88 --> 3405.839
during that whole process is it gonna

3403.599 --> 3405.839
turn

3406.04 --> 3410.799
360 degrees clockwise is it going to

3409.28 --> 3414.0
turn 300

3410.799 --> 3417.839
degrees counterclockwise

3414.0 --> 3421.44
or is it not gonna really turn and it's

3417.839 --> 3421.44
all gonna add up to zero

3421.839 --> 3424.96
right or in between let's get even

3424.24 --> 3428.72
weirder

3424.96 --> 3431.359
like these are the questions

3428.72 --> 3432.16
that we should be focusing on in order

3431.359 --> 3435.52
to figure

3432.16 --> 3439.839
out what is the real layout instead of

3435.52 --> 3447.839
focusing on some broken globe projection

3439.839 --> 3447.839
that we based the maps on how about that

3465.85 --> 3468.909
[Music]

3480.58 --> 3483.639
[Music]

3500.839 --> 3503.839
hmm

3514.839 --> 3518.5589999999997
so

3516.559 --> 3521.44
yeah yeah there's scooters in the

3518.559 --> 3531.8390000000004
background and all kinds of things

3521.44 --> 3531.839
and cars

3535.5 --> 3538.61
[Music]

3547.2 --> 3556.24
my mic must be really sensitive

3550.88 --> 3556.2400000000002
it's weird gain is not on that

3556.839 --> 3559.839
high

3595.2 --> 3600.8799999999997
yeah well i'm not gonna talk about that

3598.839 --> 3602.96
tony

3600.88 --> 3604.2400000000002
motorized vehicles you're gonna have to

3602.96 --> 3607.44
save that one for

3604.24 --> 3610.0
uh for nathan

3607.44 --> 3611.599
i don't really care i don't i don't have

3610.0 --> 3613.44
one

3611.599 --> 3615.2000000000003
can't afford one don't want to think

3613.44 --> 3617.599
about one i just got a

3615.2 --> 3619.359
freaking crappy looking bicycle that's

3617.599 --> 3621.2000000000003
crappy enough so that it'll never get

3619.359 --> 3629.839
stolen

3621.2 --> 3629.839
that's good enough for me

3654.839 --> 3661.04
hmm it's funny how emman never got back

3658.88 --> 3664.4
to that

3661.04 --> 3666.48
i thought he had a win opposite every

3664.4 --> 3668.839
map is a projection of the globe

3666.48 --> 3670.0
yeah that's what i said is not the

3668.839 --> 3672.96
opposite

3670.0 --> 3674.16
i said however is the projection is

3672.96 --> 3679.119
wrong

3674.16 --> 3679.1189999999997
the projection on which it is based is

3682.839 --> 3685.839
incorrect

3691.52 --> 3699.839
and then he went silent typical

3711.839 --> 3713.92
i

3730.6 --> 3733.659
[Music]

3738.839 --> 3741.839
so

3752.839 --> 3755.839
so

3765.119 --> 3769.839
ever notice how the south pole on a

3767.599 --> 3769.839
magnet

3770.4 --> 3774.079
i well that's how it's supposed to work

3773.76 --> 3777.8390000000004
but

3774.079 --> 3781.119
it's it's weirder because the south pole

3777.839 --> 3784.88
magnetically like

3781.119 --> 3784.88
that's not antarctica

3786.799 --> 3792.559
like it's supposed to be

3790.24 --> 3797.52
like somewhere off the coast of

3792.559 --> 3802.4
argentina i think

3797.52 --> 3802.4
and another one is was it somewhere

3802.559 --> 3806.0
near australia i think

3807.68 --> 3825.839
so yeah it's kind of weird the magnetics

3830.72 --> 3838.9599999999996
right the falklands somewhere over there

3837.92 --> 3842.64
you didn't know that yet

3838.96 --> 3844.0
all right yeah it's been discussed

3842.64 --> 3846.799
over at the flat earth debates

3844.0 --> 3846.799
periodically

3849.92 --> 3853.92
but you can even look up the magnetic

3851.92 --> 3857.039
maps

3853.92 --> 3859.6800000000003
like just google it you get full

3857.039 --> 3859.6800000000003
displays

3861.68 --> 3867.839
and yeah if you look you'll see it's

3864.72 --> 3867.839
like anything but

3868.799 --> 3875.599
well like aim a singular magnet

3872.559 --> 3877.8390000000004
with like a the globe magnet picture

3875.599 --> 3880.1600000000003
where north pole south pole magnetically

3877.839 --> 3882.4
in the magnetic field supposedly that

3880.16 --> 3886.16
thing just does not work out at

3882.4 --> 3890.88
all when you look at the actual

3886.16 --> 3890.8799999999997
magnetic maps as the magnetics have been

3892.839 --> 3895.839
registered

3907.92 --> 3913.599
what north pole magnetic pole

3911.2 --> 3915.839
is in fact is so what the hell does that

3913.599 --> 3915.839
mean

3916.96 --> 3923.839
george sanford what

3934.839 --> 3937.839
so

3962.839 --> 3965.839
so

3969.44 --> 3977.28
yeah that's very cool amen except that

3973.2 --> 3980.8799999999997
nobody actually did anything scientific

3977.28 --> 3981.92
it's just saying just saying it going in

3980.88 --> 3984.96
a circle

3981.92 --> 3989.6800000000003
around it it's just saying it

3984.96 --> 3991.76
nobody put their gyroscope on

3989.68 --> 3992.799
and then just demonstrate demonstrated

3991.76 --> 3995.76
like look

3992.799 --> 3997.359
this is how much it has rotated during

3995.76 --> 4000.079
the entire voyage

3997.359 --> 4003.2799999999997
until we ended up at the same point

4000.079 --> 4003.28
nobody's doing that

4003.76 --> 4008.96
they should they didn't

4011.28 --> 4017.92
right once you establish these details

4015.359 --> 4019.2
which oh of course of course of course

4017.92 --> 4022.0
on the globe yeah yeah

4019.2 --> 4023.359
well of course on the globe then why

4022.0 --> 4025.76
don't they freaking do this

4023.359 --> 4027.359
every single time they they do that race

4025.76 --> 4030.0
going around

4027.359 --> 4030.64
antarctica why don't they show it it's

4030.0 --> 4032.559
like

4030.64 --> 4034.16
there you go there's the proof there's

4032.559 --> 4035.52
the proof there's the proof it's an

4034.16 --> 4037.0389999999998
island there's the proof

4035.52 --> 4039.359
it's an island there's the proof it's an

4037.039 --> 4039.76
island no no no they don't do that they

4039.359 --> 4042.64
just

4039.76 --> 4042.6400000000003
make a race

4042.799 --> 4049.359
go around it and they just

4046.24 --> 4052.4799999999996
tell you it's going around it

4049.359 --> 4055.7599999999998
and then settle for that they don't

4052.48 --> 4058.48
actually prove anything they just say

4055.76 --> 4058.48
they do that

4059.2 --> 4063.4399999999996
yeah well that's very cute mn that they

4062.24 --> 4067.2
have it

4063.44 --> 4070.559
nobody's using it to prove

4067.2 --> 4072.24
that it had adds up to 360 degrees

4070.559 --> 4076.0
though during the entire voyage

4072.24 --> 4079.1189999999997
nobody does that

4076.0 --> 4080.88
right to basically hand it over

4079.119 --> 4082.88
to flat earthers like oh what you're

4080.88 --> 4086.079
going to do now with your ice wall

4082.88 --> 4089.52
surrounding us flat earthers

4086.079 --> 4093.119
look we just proof we went 360 degrees

4089.52 --> 4096.48
around an island why

4093.119 --> 4099.52
don't they do this shove it in our faces

4096.48 --> 4101.839
then you and all your

4099.52 --> 4103.4400000000005
[ __ ] money and your mainstream

4101.839 --> 4107.359
[ __ ] prestige

4103.44 --> 4108.919999999999
just [ __ ] do it then why don't you do

4107.359 --> 4111.679
it then

4108.92 --> 4112.56
demonstrate it to us stupid flat

4111.679 --> 4116.56
earthers

4112.56 --> 4119.120000000001
and our ice ring fantasy then

4116.56 --> 4121.1990000000005
people with sail boats and [ __ ] that

4119.12 --> 4122.799
have the money for this garbage and the

4121.199 --> 4125.5199999999995
time to waste on that

4122.799 --> 4127.6
why don't you do this then with the

4125.52 --> 4128.0
compasses that every sailboat supposedly

4127.6 --> 4132.319
has

4128.0 --> 4136.0
and shove it in our faces demonstrate

4132.319 --> 4147.839000000001
look we just went around an island

4136.0 --> 4150.4
here's the physical proof

4147.839 --> 4151.04
but no no no no you'll just have to

4150.4 --> 4154.4
settle

4151.04 --> 4157.44
for that [ __ ] little story

4154.4 --> 4160.48
they just went around the island

4157.44 --> 4163.2789999999995
and that's it that story you're echoing

4160.48 --> 4164.239
that's all you got nobody showed you any

4163.279 --> 4167.4400000000005
[ __ ] proof

4164.239 --> 4169.2789999999995
at all it's good enough for you because

4167.44 --> 4172.4
you're a globe

4169.279 --> 4173.279
guzzling [ __ ] and you'll settle for

4172.4 --> 4176.48
anything

4173.279 --> 4189.839000000001
anything is good enough for a [ __ ]

4176.48 --> 4189.839
slave [ __ ] of globe [ __ ]

4199.35 --> 4202.4890000000005
[Music]

4221.84 --> 4225.92
oh i triggered some didn't i i triggered

4224.0 --> 4228.48
some yeah you'll get here all day and

4225.92 --> 4230.0
remind us about how you bought the just

4228.48 --> 4232.239
so story

4230.0 --> 4233.679
is good enough and oh look at all these

4232.239 --> 4237.04
people doing that with their

4233.679 --> 4239.6
money and oh they're all so mainstream

4237.04 --> 4240.08
but you didn't get any actual proof did

4239.6 --> 4243.360000000001
you

4240.08 --> 4244.64
you just settled for this stupid little

4243.36 --> 4249.679
story

4244.64 --> 4252.320000000001
saying no see they told it to you

4249.679 --> 4254.0
they went around a circle around

4252.32 --> 4257.36
antarctica look on this

4254.0 --> 4260.08
picture showing it as an

4257.36 --> 4261.679
island and they just said look we're

4260.08 --> 4264.64
going around it

4261.679 --> 4265.04
we're telling you we're going around it

4264.64 --> 4267.52
so

4265.04 --> 4268.4
you are going to believe that because we

4267.52 --> 4271.679
told you

4268.4 --> 4275.12
we are going around in a circle

4271.679 --> 4277.28
yeah on a past antarctica they told you

4275.12 --> 4278.4
so now you believe it now you're going

4277.28 --> 4282.0
to tell us

4278.4 --> 4282.4
oh how stupid we are oh yeah we got the

4282.0 --> 4285.36
proof

4282.4 --> 4286.08
because they told us how it was they

4285.36 --> 4289.28
didn't prove

4286.08 --> 4291.199
it to us they told us because you're a

4289.28 --> 4294.5599999999995
slave

4291.199 --> 4301.839999999999
and you believe anything if it's told

4294.56 --> 4301.84
to you by your slave masters

4340.84 --> 4343.84
so

4354.84 --> 4357.84
so

4371.28 --> 4374.5599999999995
and just look at them squirt see they

4374.0 --> 4376.96
they

4374.56 --> 4378.080000000001
they don't have an answer they know it's

4376.96 --> 4382.0
true they

4378.08 --> 4385.36
know the glow believers even in chat

4382.0 --> 4389.44
waiting figuring out to input something

4385.36 --> 4392.48
meaningful to them they know i'm right

4389.44 --> 4395.678999999999
they just told you so

4392.48 --> 4398.48
showed a picture with that so you know

4395.679 --> 4399.36
what you need to believe as they're

4398.48 --> 4403.28
telling you

4399.36 --> 4405.839999999999
how it is and then

4403.28 --> 4407.199
not actually backing it up with proof of

4405.84 --> 4410.32
any sort

4407.199 --> 4413.28
not giving you actual proof

4410.32 --> 4414.159
to hammer us flat earthers over the head

4413.28 --> 4417.199
with

4414.159 --> 4417.679
and to tell some actual proof to tell us

4417.199 --> 4421.28
look

4417.679 --> 4425.1990000000005
here's the empirical evidence

4421.28 --> 4428.88
that they actually went in a 360 degree

4425.199 --> 4433.44
circle around this island

4428.88 --> 4437.12
see here's the raw data the data

4433.44 --> 4440.239
not a story not telling you how it is

4437.12 --> 4442.32
the data you don't have it

4440.239 --> 4443.44
you're not getting it because you're a

4442.32 --> 4446.48
slave

4443.44 --> 4447.678999999999
and you're just given what you need to

4446.48 --> 4450.159
believe

4447.679 --> 4452.159
and echo on like a good little slave

4450.159 --> 4455.04
[ __ ]

4452.159 --> 4456.4
just echo it on that's what that's what

4455.04 --> 4458.32
you're given

4456.4 --> 4460.5599999999995
that's what you're going to do because

4458.32 --> 4462.88
you're not going to actually

4460.56 --> 4464.080000000001
complain about it you're not going to

4462.88 --> 4467.04
actually

4464.08 --> 4468.48
tell somebody up there you have a

4467.04 --> 4469.84
connection to them yeah you're not going

4468.48 --> 4473.04
to tell them hey

4469.84 --> 4475.28
guys this racist and i was pretty cool

4473.04 --> 4476.96
let's do something for science let's put

4475.28 --> 4480.159
a gyroscope in there

4476.96 --> 4482.56
and actually measure

4480.159 --> 4484.719
like the total degree turning of the

4482.56 --> 4486.8
boats during the entire voyage around

4484.719 --> 4488.159
antarctica to show those stupid flat

4486.8 --> 4490.56
earthers

4488.159 --> 4491.679
that it is actually an island and not

4490.56 --> 4495.04
another inside

4491.679 --> 4497.4400000000005
out like not a

4495.04 --> 4498.719
surrounding ice wall around the disk

4497.44 --> 4501.04
let's show them

4498.719 --> 4502.4
right we got the money let's make this

4501.04 --> 4505.28
money worth it and just

4502.4 --> 4507.04
show them show them how stupid they are

4505.28 --> 4507.679
for believing they're surrounded by a

4507.04 --> 4511.5199999999995
nice

4507.679 --> 4516.8
circle let's prove it to them come on

4511.52 --> 4519.280000000001
come on then you're not doing it

4516.8 --> 4520.96
it's just not doing it you're all

4519.28 --> 4524.08
chicken [ __ ]

4520.96 --> 4525.76
you're cowards you

4524.08 --> 4527.76
don't believe in science you don't

4525.76 --> 4530.88
believe in progress

4527.76 --> 4533.12
you're just whining and complaining to

4530.88 --> 4534.56
the people of holding critical thinking

4533.12 --> 4537.92
of any sort

4534.56 --> 4541.52
you just want it to go away so you can

4537.92 --> 4544.0
dissolve in your little dream

4541.52 --> 4545.84
of everything goes everything is all

4544.0 --> 4548.0
right

4545.84 --> 4549.12
yeah you don't have to think about

4548.0 --> 4551.44
anything you can just

4549.12 --> 4553.92
believe whatever the [ __ ] you want

4551.44 --> 4557.5199999999995
nobody gives a [ __ ] that's what you want

4553.92 --> 4558.64
you want to be free so all that critical

4557.52 --> 4562.159000000001
thinking

4558.64 --> 4562.719
actual solutions effort oh you being

4562.159 --> 4565.44
seen

4562.719 --> 4567.679
you might be targeted for asking a real

4565.44 --> 4571.12
question yeah i know

4567.679 --> 4571.12
that's that's the world you live in

4572.08 --> 4581.84
that's what you are now

4582.8 --> 4586.08
oh he said it again did he

4587.6 --> 4592.52
navigation circumnavigation data

4591.04 --> 4594.76
guinness book of records and a

4592.52 --> 4596.320000000001
circumnavigation that oh was that

4594.76 --> 4602.4800000000005
circumnavigation

4596.32 --> 4602.48
data was that gps base perhaps

4606.84 --> 4609.84
huh

4617.28 --> 4620.88
now that's seeking star wars getting

4619.199 --> 4624.239
pissed off at nm

4620.88 --> 4626.96
but you can get the [ __ ] out immediately

4624.239 --> 4626.959999999999
scumbag

4635.84 --> 4643.12
right so yeah present

4639.04 --> 4646.64
me the uh proof of a 360 degree

4643.12 --> 4649.199
turn using physical gyroscopes

4646.64 --> 4650.2390000000005
by this supposed guinness book of record

4649.199 --> 4653.04
circumnavigation

4650.239 --> 4653.839999999999
of antarctica then show their the raw

4653.04 --> 4657.36
data that

4653.84 --> 4662.84
includes that specifically and not some

4657.36 --> 4664.48
[ __ ] gps location data

4662.84 --> 4667.84
right

4664.48 --> 4670.0
so bring it on bring it on nm

4667.84 --> 4671.92
mn you're not banned you're just timed

4670.0 --> 4674.0
out

4671.92 --> 4676.2390000000005
i i technically wouldn't have done that

4674.0 --> 4676.239
but

4676.4 --> 4679.839999999999
i get it it's annoying

4688.08 --> 4695.92
what edge of the world jeff

4691.4 --> 4695.92
townsendtown what kind of a name is that

4697.679 --> 4701.04
there is no edge

4702.08 --> 4709.44
there's no edge no edge

4705.36 --> 4711.759999999999
no edge yeah the edge is a straw man

4709.44 --> 4711.759999999999
myth

4712.96 --> 4717.28
right you know what does have an edge a

4715.04 --> 4720.88
globe

4717.28 --> 4724.639999999999
when you look at a globe

4720.88 --> 4728.2390000000005
it has an edge the edge is the circle

4724.64 --> 4728.2390000000005
that separates it

4728.88 --> 4732.88
from what's around it and everything

4731.6 --> 4736.56
behind it

4732.88 --> 4739.12
consi is concealed behind this edge

4736.56 --> 4740.96
of the sphere right and you don't like

4739.12 --> 4741.84
that globus don't like to be reminded

4740.96 --> 4744.159
about that

4741.84 --> 4745.04
so then they ask us where's the edge of

4744.159 --> 4747.44
your model

4745.04 --> 4748.96
the edge in your [ __ ] straw man model

4747.44 --> 4752.239
that we never claimed

4748.96 --> 4753.199
and was basically shoved into us at the

4752.239 --> 4756.799999999999
first confront

4753.199 --> 4758.799999999999
straw man [ __ ] confrontation like oh

4756.8 --> 4761.28
this is the stupid flat earth

4758.8 --> 4763.1990000000005
they believe in edge it's literally the

4761.28 --> 4765.04
first [ __ ] straw man thing you've

4763.199 --> 4767.919999999999
ever been taught

4765.04 --> 4769.04
and you're echoing it like like you ever

4767.92 --> 4772.32
heard any of us

4769.04 --> 4774.84
ever say that i've never heard a flat

4772.32 --> 4777.759999999999
earther say that

4774.84 --> 4781.679
ever ever

4777.76 --> 4784.719
not a single one ever

4781.679 --> 4786.719
yet everybody keeps repeating that

4784.719 --> 4789.04
[ __ ] conditioning

4786.719 --> 4790.719
because it's the first straw man you

4789.04 --> 4794.08
learn it's the first

4790.719 --> 4796.32
false reason you are taught why

4794.08 --> 4798.48
flat earth is ridiculous is because the

4796.32 --> 4801.199
edge the edge you can fall of oh look at

4798.48 --> 4806.0
the water going over the edge

4801.199 --> 4809.36
yeah yeah that's the first straw man lie

4806.0 --> 4811.28
that's been sprinkled over you

4809.36 --> 4812.639
to convince you that flat earth is

4811.28 --> 4815.84
ridiculous

4812.639 --> 4816.84
and yet no flat earther has ever claimed

4815.84 --> 4821.4400000000005
that

4816.84 --> 4821.4400000000005
ever it's a complete lie

4821.679 --> 4833.12
it's this drama and lie and you still

4823.92 --> 4835.28
repeat it where does the containment

4833.12 --> 4837.28
meet the ground

4835.28 --> 4838.48
i don't know does the containment ever

4837.28 --> 4841.44
meet the ground

4838.48 --> 4842.48
batman foreign you're asking cosmic

4841.44 --> 4845.36
cosmogeny

4842.48 --> 4847.36
technical question now right it's a

4845.36 --> 4850.0
little difficult

4847.36 --> 4850.799999999999
right so what is the actual orientation

4850.0 --> 4854.8
of everything

4850.8 --> 4856.88
in the realm it's kind of

4854.8 --> 4859.52
necessary to figure that out first

4856.88 --> 4863.36
before we can even proceed to figure out

4859.52 --> 4863.360000000001
the total confines of the realm

4863.84 --> 4867.6
so the earth is infinite in size no it's

4866.0 --> 4871.199
not

4867.6 --> 4874.56
infinity and physical reality do not

4871.199 --> 4878.4
go inside

4874.56 --> 4878.400000000001
that's illogical

4878.719 --> 4886.4800000000005
but there might be unexpected

4883.199 --> 4890.0
elements to the realm

4886.48 --> 4892.0
well unexpected to those that have lived

4890.0 --> 4894.239
and grew up

4892.0 --> 4895.36
imagining an infinite outer space

4894.239 --> 4898.5599999999995
surrounding the sphere

4895.36 --> 4900.48
earth because when you just continually

4898.56 --> 4902.159000000001
get exposed with that form of

4900.48 --> 4905.599999999999
imagination then

4902.159 --> 4908.799999999999
some other kind of mysterious

4905.6 --> 4910.159000000001
seeming setup may be just inconceivable

4908.8 --> 4912.88
to you

4910.159 --> 4913.44
right like for example what if there is

4912.88 --> 4918.639
a

4913.44 --> 4922.719
spatial within the realm

4918.639 --> 4925.36
let's let's start with east to west

4922.719 --> 4928.32
what if you just went in a straight line

4925.36 --> 4930.159
to either east or west

4928.32 --> 4932.08
and you end up in the same place even

4930.159 --> 4933.92
though you geometrically went on a

4932.08 --> 4937.04
perfectly straight line

4933.92 --> 4940.8
perfectly straight not curving

4937.04 --> 4943.92
vertically not having to

4940.8 --> 4945.76
adapt left or right turning or anything

4943.92 --> 4948.88
you end up in the same spot

4945.76 --> 4952.639
well if that's the case then

4948.88 --> 4955.1990000000005
it's a serious distinct possibility

4952.639 --> 4958.32
there's a looping factor in the very

4955.199 --> 4960.4
confinement of the realm itself

4958.32 --> 4964.159
so it may be looping in on itself like a

4960.4 --> 4964.159
continual portal that's just

4965.52 --> 4970.84
yeah a straight path looping in on

4968.56 --> 4973.280000000001
itself

4970.84 --> 4975.6
eternally even though there's a limited

4973.28 --> 4979.12
spatial confine

4975.6 --> 4982.08
it interconnects infinitely now that's a

4979.12 --> 4982.88
a possibility you can call it pacman

4982.08 --> 4986.4
theory

4982.88 --> 4986.88
really [ __ ] you [ __ ] next time you're

4986.4 --> 4988.638999999999
ben

4986.88 --> 4992.2390000000005
if you're gonna open up with something

4988.639 --> 4994.08
like that again i'm banning you

4992.239 --> 4997.5199999999995
right you already got a timeout you're

4994.08 --> 4997.5199999999995
lucky you're not bad [ __ ]

4997.92 --> 5002.639
right but a loop yeah there may be

5000.8 --> 5005.04
looping

5002.639 --> 5005.679
factors to the realm and east and west

5005.04 --> 5008.88
are very

5005.679 --> 5011.1990000000005
likely actually it's the

5008.88 --> 5012.32
the first logical step where a loop

5011.199 --> 5016.799999999999
would be present

5012.32 --> 5016.799999999999
if any east to west

5018.239 --> 5024.799999999999
but it might be more

5021.679 --> 5026.88
it might even be north to south and then

5024.8 --> 5029.04
a whole bunch of magical stuff

5026.88 --> 5030.159000000001
will be revealed it's pretty incredible

5029.04 --> 5035.44
because

5030.159 --> 5035.44
if that were actually the case then

5035.84 --> 5040.4800000000005
maybe there is no touchdown point

5040.84 --> 5046.719
physically

5043.76 --> 5046.719
ever considered that

5047.76 --> 5054.639
there might be no touchdown point

5050.8 --> 5057.04
for a barrier if it's looping

5054.639 --> 5057.92
both north and south directions which by

5057.04 --> 5061.92
the way would be

5057.92 --> 5062.32
pretty literal uniform directions and

5061.92 --> 5064.96
not

5062.32 --> 5065.84
angular base directions it would be an

5064.96 --> 5069.44
absolute

5065.84 --> 5072.2390000000005
axis north south absolute straight line

5069.44 --> 5075.919999999999
east west absolute straight line right

5072.239 --> 5080.0
that's the easiest rectangular

5075.92 --> 5081.679
looping confined to help visualize how

5080.0 --> 5083.76
that would work but there could also be

5081.679 --> 5086.0
irregular loops and then things get very

5083.76 --> 5089.1990000000005
complicated but what

5086.0 --> 5091.92
primary side effect of

5089.199 --> 5092.638999999999
a looping nature of the realm would be

5091.92 --> 5095.04
is that

5092.639 --> 5097.28
there doesn't need to technically be any

5095.04 --> 5098.32
touchdown point for a dome for the

5097.28 --> 5100.32
container

5098.32 --> 5102.239
because the container would not have to

5100.32 --> 5105.28
surround

5102.239 --> 5109.839999999999
the volume because the volume

5105.28 --> 5112.639
surrounds itself there is no more space

5109.84 --> 5114.4800000000005
available for matter to move into so it

5112.639 --> 5117.12
just presses in on itself

5114.48 --> 5118.5599999999995
within the limited volume available

5117.12 --> 5122.48
thanks to the looping

5118.56 --> 5124.320000000001
segment the looping element of the realm

5122.48 --> 5127.759999999999
itself

5124.32 --> 5132.799999999999
the very space that matter can be

5127.76 --> 5132.8
in would have a looping nature

5133.12 --> 5136.48
right yeah oh i know it's kind of

5135.52 --> 5138.320000000001
surreal

5136.48 --> 5140.08
when you actually start to think about

5138.32 --> 5143.44
it and try to

5140.08 --> 5146.88
define it what that is i spent a great

5143.44 --> 5146.879999999999
deal of time working on that

5151.28 --> 5155.28
and it yeah it's very much an option and

5154.08 --> 5157.92
it's

5155.28 --> 5158.8
it might turn out to be so much of an

5157.92 --> 5162.04
option

5158.8 --> 5165.6
that it's going to be torturous

5162.04 --> 5169.04
torturous to truly figure it out

5165.6 --> 5171.280000000001
because what if the

5169.04 --> 5172.48
spatial loop is not super straight

5171.28 --> 5176.08
forward east to west

5172.48 --> 5180.638999999999
right what if it's a circle

5176.08 --> 5182.32
but what if within the circle

5180.639 --> 5183.679
there's more space than could

5182.32 --> 5187.04
geometrically fit

5183.679 --> 5190.88
within the circle and what if within

5187.04 --> 5192.88
that circle another space

5190.88 --> 5194.159000000001
would be present that would

5192.88 --> 5198.159000000001
geometrically not

5194.159 --> 5200.5599999999995
fit within that circle endlessly

5198.159 --> 5201.92
right there's all kinds of spatial

5200.56 --> 5205.4400000000005
warping

5201.92 --> 5208.0
effects that might pop up once we

5205.44 --> 5208.48
really start to measure things out and

5208.0 --> 5211.679
it might

5208.48 --> 5212.32
freak the [ __ ] out of here because it's

5211.679 --> 5214.159
going to be

5212.32 --> 5216.48
so warped while everything is so

5214.159 --> 5220.0
freaking flat it's like all flat but

5216.48 --> 5223.12
like nothing is physic

5220.0 --> 5223.6
could be it could be also warped even

5223.12 --> 5226.5599999999995
though it's

5223.6 --> 5228.719
all there it's all flat it interconnects

5226.56 --> 5230.96
and yet it doesn't really

5228.719 --> 5232.719
you could never make it fit it could

5230.96 --> 5235.28
turn out to be a situation

5232.719 --> 5236.639
where everything is exactly where it is

5235.28 --> 5240.0
it's all flat

5236.639 --> 5240.8
but no matter what you do you can't make

5240.0 --> 5244.96
it fit

5240.8 --> 5249.12
you can't make it fit on a projection

5244.96 --> 5253.84
right and maybe that is even the reason

5249.12 --> 5253.84
why the glow projection was made

5253.92 --> 5260.88
to kind of seal it seal

5257.04 --> 5263.6
that inside off completely

5260.88 --> 5263.92
because if it were unsealed it would be

5263.6 --> 5266.4800000000005
too

5263.92 --> 5267.36
mind-blowing anyway it would be tessary

5266.48 --> 5271.199
or maybe some

5267.36 --> 5273.12
other bizarre insights that are a side

5271.199 --> 5276.638999999999
effect of knowing these things

5273.12 --> 5280.0
might be revealed that would make

5276.639 --> 5282.88
people with power lose control some more

5280.0 --> 5284.159
you know always a good reason to

5282.88 --> 5287.52
fabricate

5284.159 --> 5295.839999999999
a concealment like the glow projection

5287.52 --> 5295.84
that is obviously flawed

5304.159 --> 5308.4
right so an idea of how long we can for

5307.04 --> 5311.679
example is

5308.4 --> 5314.4
like and this is just a very raw idea

5311.679 --> 5314.96
like a raw template almost for a story

5314.4 --> 5318.08
writing

5314.96 --> 5321.44
situation like

5318.08 --> 5322.0
the bermuda triangle what if there's

5321.44 --> 5325.199
something

5322.0 --> 5326.56
really spatially looping right there

5325.199 --> 5329.678999999999
what if there's just

5326.56 --> 5332.320000000001
way more space in that area than

5329.679 --> 5334.8
should be and that that is a reason why

5332.32 --> 5338.5599999999995
things crash and get lost

5334.8 --> 5342.08
like really get lost in a relatively

5338.56 --> 5345.360000000001
small space how could that be well maybe

5342.08 --> 5349.12
there is just like three

5345.36 --> 5351.28
four maybe ten times more space there

5349.12 --> 5352.5599999999995
then actually should be fitting because

5351.28 --> 5354.88
of a spatial loop

5352.56 --> 5357.1990000000005
situation like a compacted space it

5354.88 --> 5360.32
might be a natural occurring

5357.199 --> 5365.839999999999
thing that's just present there like a

5360.32 --> 5365.84
spike of condensed space

5369.6 --> 5373.4400000000005
jay dillard there is no qe scientific

5372.159 --> 5379.839999999999
method there is only

5373.44 --> 5379.839999999999
the scientific method

5380.159 --> 5385.92
it's not qe's method although he

5382.4 --> 5389.04
appreciates you calling it that

5385.92 --> 5392.0
right it's the scientific method not

5389.04 --> 5393.84
qes he did not invent it he simply

5392.0 --> 5396.0
bringing it back

5393.84 --> 5398.96
where it should be where it should have

5396.0 --> 5398.96
been all along

5399.44 --> 5404.799999999999
prove the cause of an effect which has

5402.239 --> 5407.919999999999
to be a natural phenomenon

5404.8 --> 5410.96
not a conjured phenomenon within a

5407.92 --> 5414.56
man-made device you have to

5410.96 --> 5417.28
physically manipulate the independent

5414.56 --> 5418.719
variable in order to establish the cause

5417.28 --> 5421.759999999999
of the effect

5418.719 --> 5425.28
that's the scientific method it's not

5421.76 --> 5429.679
anybody's it's

5425.28 --> 5429.679
physics it's of physics

5429.84 --> 5435.360000000001
i don't know who originally came up

5432.96 --> 5436.4
who originally unveiled the literal

5435.36 --> 5438.48
scientific method

5436.4 --> 5440.08
if it could even be attributed to an

5438.48 --> 5443.839999999999
individual

5440.08 --> 5445.12
but i think it's more important than any

5443.84 --> 5448.8
individual

5445.12 --> 5451.92
it's simply the ultimate foundation

5448.8 --> 5454.639
the foundation of physical reality

5451.92 --> 5456.719
and everything that is physically real

5454.639 --> 5458.56
and that includes the non-physical

5456.719 --> 5461.52
things like information

5458.56 --> 5462.56
like light yeah those things are

5461.52 --> 5465.6
provable

5462.56 --> 5465.6
through physics

5466.8 --> 5477.84
because of the scientific method

5502.84 --> 5505.84
so

5511.92 --> 5519.04
oh look yay

5515.76 --> 5522.56
more gps yeah look dude

5519.04 --> 5526.239
gps does not prove [ __ ] gps already has

5522.56 --> 5528.639
a presuppositional based relay system

5526.239 --> 5530.08
you have to get physical no more

5528.639 --> 5532.719
projections

5530.08 --> 5536.5599999999995
gyroscope use a physical gyroscope to

5532.719 --> 5536.56
track the actual orientation

5539.199 --> 5543.44
and then we can talk then let's talk

5541.76 --> 5546.08
data once you have it

5543.44 --> 5548.08
once you have the actual data that is

5546.08 --> 5551.36
required

5548.08 --> 5554.88
then we'll talk i'm not interested in

5551.36 --> 5561.839999999999
gps coordinate relays

5554.88 --> 5561.84
all right

5564.69 --> 5570.589999999999
[Music]

5580.48 --> 5585.04
what gyroscopes do what do they record

5584.0 --> 5588.639
what data well

5585.04 --> 5593.76
angular data the exact

5588.639 --> 5593.76
euclidean orientation of a vessel

5595.199 --> 5601.5199999999995
during its travel so

5598.239 --> 5603.839999999999
we're talking euclidean literalness

5601.52 --> 5605.120000000001
right very important when you're trying

5603.84 --> 5617.84
to figure out

5605.12 --> 5617.84
spatial confine right

5620.32 --> 5623.599999999999
it's lit it's literally so important

5623.199 --> 5627.759999999999
that

5623.6 --> 5629.92
gyroscope gyroscopes

5627.76 --> 5631.280000000001
can be used to basically navigate

5629.92 --> 5634.88
completely blind

5631.28 --> 5638.8
if you know the terrain

5634.88 --> 5641.4400000000005
like robots can be if they have a

5638.8 --> 5642.96
map layout of a terrain through scanning

5641.44 --> 5645.199
or whatever we're talking like pretty

5642.96 --> 5647.639
high tech

5645.199 --> 5650.08
it's the gyroscope that tells them

5647.639 --> 5654.159000000001
exactly

5650.08 --> 5656.8
where they are their orientation

5654.159 --> 5657.199
so they wouldn't need they wouldn't even

5656.8 --> 5661.04
need

5657.199 --> 5663.678999999999
any sensors technically

5661.04 --> 5665.92
they relied purely on the gyroscope now

5663.679 --> 5667.679
of course there might be mechanical side

5665.92 --> 5669.84
effects that would

5667.679 --> 5672.96
do make it a little bit more difficult

5669.84 --> 5675.679
but technically with a gyroscope

5672.96 --> 5676.96
you can blind navigate if you know the

5675.679 --> 5680.639
terrain if the

5676.96 --> 5684.56
terrain has been scanned and mapped

5680.639 --> 5686.88
then with that data any device

5684.56 --> 5689.360000000001
as long as it has is capable and will

5686.88 --> 5693.1990000000005
not get dis-oriented

5689.36 --> 5695.44
in its navigation could with a gyroscope

5693.199 --> 5698.5599999999995
a physical gyroscope navigate

5695.44 --> 5701.36
perfectly without freaking cameras or

5698.56 --> 5702.719
scanners or anything just knowing the

5701.36 --> 5705.36
terrain

5702.719 --> 5706.639
having actually scanned it it could

5705.36 --> 5709.599999999999
blind navigate

5706.639 --> 5710.32
thanks to a gyroscope because of its

5709.6 --> 5715.84
perfect

5710.32 --> 5715.84
euclidean anchoring effect

5724.639 --> 5729.84
what the [ __ ] are you what about

5732.08 --> 5735.28
that's what they use with for drones

5734.0 --> 5743.84
that's right

5735.28 --> 5743.84
nathan yamaha that's correct

5748.639 --> 5752.719
right because gyroscopes don't give a

5751.92 --> 5756.2390000000005
[ __ ] about

5752.719 --> 5758.96
map projections and coordinate systems

5756.239 --> 5760.48
they just show you exactly what the

5758.96 --> 5763.28
orientation is

5760.48 --> 5765.04
literal the literal orientation it

5763.28 --> 5766.08
doesn't give a [ __ ] about any

5765.04 --> 5769.28
projections

5766.08 --> 5772.96
of coordinates it just

5769.28 --> 5775.36
is exactly as it is

5772.96 --> 5777.28
within the euclidean space it does not

5775.36 --> 5780.96
need orientation

5777.28 --> 5783.92
or to be told what the coordinates are

5780.96 --> 5786.719
right that's why i want the gyroscope

5783.92 --> 5790.4
data and not some stupid gps

5786.719 --> 5795.28
coordinate like telling you where it is

5790.4 --> 5795.28
on the projected presupposed map

5796.84 --> 5799.84
right

5815.76 --> 5819.119000000001
okay dillard you don't know what the

5817.679 --> 5822.639
[ __ ] you're talking about stop

5819.119 --> 5822.639
projecting your [ __ ]

5823.04 --> 5829.5199999999995
on foul on buchanan okay i'm pretty sure

5826.56 --> 5831.119000000001
fault on buchanan is way beyond those

5829.52 --> 5836.320000000001
standard

5831.119 --> 5836.32
assumptions that you project on him

5836.88 --> 5842.4800000000005
right there is no problems we know what

5840.8 --> 5844.4800000000005
the problems are we know

5842.48 --> 5845.919999999999
what we know and we know what we don't

5844.48 --> 5850.48
know

5845.92 --> 5850.4800000000005
and your straw man is not helping you

5851.119 --> 5858.4
we are not pre-assuming a fixed

5854.239 --> 5861.119
system we're still figuring out

5858.4 --> 5862.4
what it is what it could be how we can

5861.119 --> 5868.48
come to the data

5862.4 --> 5872.159
of knowing yeah so don't straw man

5868.48 --> 5882.159
oh okay

5872.159 --> 5884.799999999999
what i thought he's a baller

5882.159 --> 5888.08
well he's not really a baller i think is

5884.8 --> 5888.08
what why would you say that

5894.84 --> 5897.84
god

5917.84 --> 5926.719
that's not true what

5924.639 --> 5928.719
batman for never you saying sex sins

5926.719 --> 5931.04
don't work anymore

5928.719 --> 5931.04
what

5935.28 --> 5939.84
since when did they stop working

5957.36 --> 5963.839999999999
one more orbit is the data really

5961.84 --> 5966.4800000000005
why don't you just tell me what the data

5963.84 --> 5968.88
is and then now considering looking it

5966.48 --> 5971.44
up yeah

5968.88 --> 5972.32
i'm not gonna google [ __ ] for you tell

5971.44 --> 5976.159
me what it is

5972.32 --> 5981.84
and then if i hear the right things i

5976.159 --> 5981.839999999999
might actually look it up

5988.56 --> 5996.56
laser gyro gps data

5992.96 --> 6009.84
servers that's

5996.56 --> 6009.84
so what did it supposedly do

6031.44 --> 6036.799999999999
i mean i know he's presenting it

6034.88 --> 6039.119
like he really believes he has something

6036.8 --> 6039.119000000001
there

6043.119 --> 6049.44
circumnavigate oh

6046.8 --> 6051.1990000000005
i think i remember that thing i think

6049.44 --> 6053.5199999999995
that was brought up some time ago also

6051.199 --> 6056.08
on the flat earth debates

6053.52 --> 6058.56
yeah it didn't do [ __ ] it just went back

6056.08 --> 6058.5599999999995
and forth

6059.36 --> 6065.839999999999
it literally did not prove the

6061.199 --> 6065.839999999999
orientation of any of it

6066.4 --> 6072.799999999999
it did not circumnavigate

6069.679 --> 6073.1990000000005
so that's what i remember from that like

6072.8 --> 6079.84
it's

6073.199 --> 6079.839999999999
literally a hyped up lie

6085.28 --> 6089.199
see i don't need to google [ __ ] i just

6087.84 --> 6093.4400000000005
need somebody to

6089.199 --> 6096.719
tell me what it's about

6093.44 --> 6098.638999999999
and i'll remember because look i've been

6096.719 --> 6100.159
on the flat earth debates and all that

6098.639 --> 6104.08
like for years now

6100.159 --> 6107.839999999999
daily so this [ __ ] i pick up on it

6104.08 --> 6107.84
it comes by

6132.26 --> 6135.35
[Music]

6327.84 --> 6331.84
oh yes i am on mute that's right

6331.92 --> 6345.84
i forgot thanks for telling me

6361.28 --> 6369.119
right i'm gonna round out the show guys

6364.8 --> 6369.119000000001
this is with mn is not gonna go anywhere

6371.199 --> 6378.799999999999
but yeah this this one more orbit [ __ ]

6375.679 --> 6381.84
i basically dug through the side

6378.8 --> 6384.159000000001
it's really cheap ass i think they want

6381.84 --> 6386.88
you to buy some video and i

6384.159 --> 6389.28
guarantee you i will put money on it

6386.88 --> 6393.84
that they don't

6389.28 --> 6396.08
basically reveal any data any at all

6393.84 --> 6397.679
it's probably all suggestion based

6396.08 --> 6400.8
somebody took a flight

6397.679 --> 6403.84
the flight is obviously not in an orbit

6400.8 --> 6403.84
obviously not

6404.88 --> 6409.84
and otherwise they just show you the raw

6408.239 --> 6412.48
things i'm pretty sure they just went

6409.84 --> 6416.56
back and forth in a circle

6412.48 --> 6418.959999999999
and i even saw that in the first google

6416.56 --> 6418.96
search

6420.8 --> 6426.8
on a rectangular map just immediately

6424.239 --> 6426.799999999999
stood out

6427.28 --> 6430.32
