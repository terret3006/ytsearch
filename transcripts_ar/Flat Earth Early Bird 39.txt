3.07 --> 10.639
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.04 --> 15.408999999999999
early-bird number 39 and your host

10.639 --> 17.45
Arwen and today is cold once again

15.409 --> 28.630000000000003
although all the snow has completely

17.45 --> 28.63
disappeared and sometimes rainy so

28.75 --> 37.81
there's stuff going on I guess not in

35.03 --> 37.81
the best of moods

39.08 --> 42.229
[Music]

49.329 --> 62.27
it's just this thing alarm in Skype

53.21 --> 64.4
really annoying in my opinion and most

62.27 --> 71.09
don't even want to talk about it but it

64.4 --> 73.52000000000001
has to do with Nora and basically still

71.09 --> 78.229
getting into arguments with Riley about

73.52 --> 83.33
the relative density theory and trying

78.229 --> 85.729
to derail it constantly and when I

83.33 --> 91.69
actually try to explain to her what the

85.729 --> 95.75
point of it is self containing

91.69 --> 97.85
scientifically provable theory she seems

95.75 --> 101.539
to ignore it completely and then starts

97.85 --> 108.16
to wander off into basically the

101.539 --> 110.93
operation effects of gravity and how

108.16 --> 118.09
well it comes down to how deduction

110.93 --> 121.959
based reasoning is how do you say

118.09 --> 125.36
reliable enough to go on basically

121.959 --> 130.13
bypassing the scientific method and that

125.36 --> 133.43
is completely useless and she she never

130.13 --> 141.67
shut ups about this she really doesn't

133.43 --> 148.06
and find it almost unbearable because

141.67 --> 153.61999999999998
like I was there a few months ago and

148.06 --> 157.61
took widespread advice talked a lot and

153.62 --> 160.489
there is just no way to really bypass

157.61 --> 162.38000000000002
the scientific method in that yeah sure

160.489 --> 166.52
we can all theorize about all these

162.38 --> 168.01999999999998
things and hey I've said before just

166.52 --> 170.78
because some things an aberration

168.02 --> 173.56900000000002
doesn't mean that that's the end of it

170.78 --> 177.95
because there's still these yeah what

173.569 --> 179.54
causes the aberrations all that but at

177.95 --> 182.92999999999998
this point it's

179.54 --> 189.64999999999998
to attack the relative density theory

182.93 --> 191.659
there's no point to it and she refuses

189.65 --> 196.01000000000002
to listen to reason and I find it quite

191.659 --> 198.14
unbearable and got really pissed off

196.01 --> 200.87
maybe that also has something to do with

198.14 --> 204.58999999999997
the self works I don't know I listened

200.87 --> 207.68
back to yesterday's early bird and yeah

204.59 --> 208.28
the volume was off that was kind of

207.68 --> 210.109
annoying

208.28 --> 214.909
I was really loud and at the same time I

210.109 --> 216.47
seemed to be pretty freaking angry I was

214.909 --> 220.04
kind of surprised I didn't really feel

216.47 --> 224.03
like that during during the Hangout

220.04 --> 229.489
itself so maybe this stuff gotta be

224.03 --> 231.56
careful maybe it is alpha power although

229.489 --> 245.09
with the alpha power I did definitely

231.56 --> 249.669
notice but yeah I'll try to tone it down

245.09 --> 251.769
a little if somebody decides to join

249.669 --> 256.389
gosh yeah that was kind of annoying

251.769 --> 256.389
anyway well I did make good points but

257.859 --> 269.659
yeah that's not the way I should do

261.289 --> 271.76
things in my opinion anyway I see drink

269.659 --> 276.56
chat P Mars

271.76 --> 283.87
Asura Ender's days mr. Rick's

276.56 --> 283.87

365.1 --> 371.46000000000004
yeah if you want to join that's the way

368.039 --> 378.71
to do it because I'm not putting the

371.46 --> 378.71
link public a Nathan doing

394.36 --> 404.61
mm-hmm yeah there's something going on

400.3 --> 404.61
with the yellow vests pretty interesting

412.74 --> 416.729
hey what's this

427.33 --> 432.55
okay that is weird

432.909 --> 444.129
where are my moderator powers what

445.68 --> 456.0
okay this is really bizarre I am now

451.1 --> 457.889
trying to do things in chat and the only

456.0 --> 459.78
thing I can do is go to channel I don't

457.889 --> 463.639
have moderate your powers what the

459.78 --> 463.63899999999995
freaking hell is going on

468.84 --> 483.479
no Nathan or Adam can you check out like

480.139 --> 485.729
do you still have moderator options not

483.479 --> 487.65
telling you to do anything with them at

485.729 --> 490.919
this point but do you still have them

487.65 --> 493.79999999999995
because the only option I seem to be

490.919 --> 496.37
getting is go to channel this is really

493.8 --> 496.37
weird

529.56 --> 539.6099999999999
okay right now you don't need to tie

534.839 --> 546.48
them out but I don't know why but I

539.61 --> 551.22
don't seem to be having any options at

546.48 --> 566.1
this point really annoying odds

551.22 --> 571.0500000000001
oh okay they're back weird

566.1 --> 583.339
YouTube is being weird now I don't worry

571.05 --> 583.3389999999999
about it I got my my options back so

587.86 --> 598.92
oh that's right it hey I'll wait hey

595.14 --> 605.4399999999999
how's it going right hey Dan

598.92 --> 612.0999999999999
yeah doing okay I guess trying to cool

605.44 --> 619.47
down from ah cool down the master bee

612.1 --> 619.47
jet no really

625.39 --> 629.4399999999999
yeah quick chat the other day about

627.33 --> 631.44
antibiotics that include all silver I

629.44 --> 635.9200000000001
was listening so that was pretty cool uh

631.44 --> 640.1800000000001
hold on your volume is little Oh speak

635.92 --> 642.4
up again oh yeah you might want it and

640.18 --> 644.8
it's been I'm gonna speak this thing but

642.4 --> 650.17
yeah that conversation yesterday was

644.8 --> 653.29
good about antibiotics and stuff yep yep

650.17 --> 657.0699999999999
oh by the way about that that I got this

653.29 --> 660.25
typical troll who is I think he's yeah

657.07 --> 662.47
he's always commenting on my hangouts

660.25 --> 664.54
like every single one and I delete every

662.47 --> 668.62
single one of them I think his account

664.54 --> 670.93
name is Hoggard whatever and he

668.62 --> 674.05
literally said on his latest comment

670.93 --> 676.9599999999999
that he is an ex NSA employee and he

674.05 --> 679.12
started rambling on yeah he said that

676.96 --> 681.6600000000001
and said well you know I'm about how

679.12 --> 685.6
colloidal silver especially when

681.66 --> 688.93
injected intravenously like I never said

685.6 --> 690.97
to do that that you turn blue and all

688.93 --> 694.15
this crap and all organ failure and

690.97 --> 697.8100000000001
that's total misinformation blue man

694.15 --> 701.68
based information when you use silver

697.81 --> 705.79
nitrate and not properly distilled water

701.68 --> 709.9599999999999
based colloidal silver and that was just

705.79 --> 715.75
nasty because it does work it really

709.96 --> 718.6600000000001
does work thank you is that Lincoln

715.75 --> 720.929
there's a blue man but obviously

718.66 --> 723.6089999999999
something's went wrong with him

720.929 --> 725.709
no yeah I know what went wrong with him

723.609 --> 729.1890000000001
it is voeis tablished he took silver

725.709 --> 731.679
nitrate and a lot of it excess amounts

729.189 --> 732.549
and silver nitrate is not colloidal

731.679 --> 735.959
silver

732.549 --> 739.899
it's literally silver bound to nitrate

735.959 --> 746.7689999999999
so yeah that's not gonna have the same

739.899 --> 756.579
effect yeah

746.769 --> 759.329
ridiculous yeah that guy was crazy just

756.579 --> 764.319
kind of like the PJ of awareness over

759.329 --> 778.3889999999999
good but worse it was very much like

764.319 --> 781.449
that yeah weird stuff and yeah if you

778.389 --> 783.669
combine it with other things as well and

781.449 --> 786.699
do fantastic

783.669 --> 792.249
I can do absolutely the same and more

786.699 --> 794.2489999999999
and better than the anti biotics it kind

792.249 --> 798.249
of depends on the scenario though

794.249 --> 800.259
because like during heavy surgery which

798.249 --> 804.339
I tend to not recommend in the first

800.259 --> 806.769
place then yeah actually dependent on

804.339 --> 809.2890000000001
whatever chemicals they're going to be

806.769 --> 811.9590000000001
using to stabilize you during surgery

809.289 --> 813.939
that's already gonna be if some for yeah

811.959 --> 817.209
chemical influence on your body

813.939 --> 820.8389999999999
disrupting things and then other

817.209 --> 822.5189999999999
substances may cause imbalance because

820.839 --> 824.4390000000001
of that I don't know but that's because

822.519 --> 828.609
of surgery then everything becomes

824.439 --> 831.459
messed up and really tricky but yeah

828.609 --> 833.529
without that just a regular infection I

831.459 --> 838.1189999999999
would for example besides colloidal

833.529 --> 842.97
silver topically and maybe yeah

838.119 --> 847.9590000000001
consuming it it would be good to get

842.97 --> 850.4490000000001
tumor tumeric powder which is also

847.959 --> 853.809
anti-inflammatory and helps healing a

850.449 --> 854.38
lot it has so many good functions but

853.809 --> 857.74
yet the

854.38 --> 860.2
that's work sound what the bodies that

857.74 --> 862.54
works directly it also helps your joints

860.2 --> 866.2
and everything but yeah it is also a

862.54 --> 870.4
known anti-inflammatory so you can take

866.2 --> 872.71
that to prevent is infection and it

870.4 --> 875.4399999999999
works really quickly if it's a refined

872.71 --> 878.2
version properly we're fine

875.44 --> 881.4100000000001
so yeah that's you can even combine that

878.2 --> 886.9000000000001
and that's another thing just one her

881.41 --> 888.2199999999999
herb and there's so many yeah add some

886.9 --> 891.8199999999999
turmeric in my tea

888.22 --> 894.9100000000001
and if stained all the muck yellow

891.82 --> 899.73
inside of it but yeah it is you know

894.91 --> 899.73
does it stain your teeth and stuff yeah

900.72 --> 909.28
it stains it is very very yellow and

906.3 --> 913.0899999999999
there's like one of yeah there's the

909.28 --> 916.54
powder it's all over the place and look

913.09 --> 934.7800000000001
here's this the dryer thing and it even

916.54 --> 936.52
turned yellow yeah those people that

934.78 --> 938.91
don't want to go to the doctors they can

936.52 --> 941.71
just find alternative things like

938.91 --> 943.8399999999999
colored or silver I some people can't be

941.71 --> 945.73
bothered to go to their doctor although

943.84 --> 949.6600000000001
they're afraid of the doctor so they

945.73 --> 952.72
just well they can't make an appointment

949.66 --> 954.6999999999999
or whatever for IVA reason mm-hmm some

952.72 --> 959.0500000000001
people are just too proud to say that

954.7 --> 961.5400000000001
he'll just go ill so they can just get

959.05 --> 967.7199999999999
like turmeric so right

961.54 --> 970.0899999999999
well they need like a a wise let me be a

967.72 --> 972.49
bit sexist but like a wise woman in the

970.09 --> 975.88
family just tells them oh yeah got this

972.49 --> 977.62
take this could be you guys you know but

975.88 --> 980.5
if you got one of these people in your

977.62 --> 984.839
family that really knows that do you bet

980.5 --> 984.839
you all barely need a doctor or ever

984.93 --> 992.3889999999999
just got to know the right person

987.57 --> 1003.2900000000001
knows what to do yeah home remedies

992.389 --> 1005.649
mm-hmm so we need to wait a while a

1003.29 --> 1005.649
woman

1007.209 --> 1020.0189999999999
Oh y-yeah remedying the globe is more a

1014.569 --> 1020.019
psychological task than a medical one

1020.29 --> 1028.1
it's gonna take a night off of all of us

1024.62 --> 1040.089
I think it's not one person gonna make

1028.1 --> 1043.069
the make it all possible and free yeah I

1040.089 --> 1044.6789999999999
say what's been going on lately I

1043.069 --> 1049.549
haven't really been tuning in

1044.679 --> 1051.52

1190.3 --> 1193.97
unfortunately married to a

1191.87 --> 1195.83
microbiologist too sore so I actually

1193.97 --> 1197.54
wrote it in chat who's the pagan at a

1195.83 --> 1200.6899999999998
bit of a witch there we eat see all that

1197.54 --> 1203.8999999999999
nothing wrong with that really we all

1200.69 --> 1205.8200000000002
come be very healthily very organically

1203.9 --> 1207.68
and the whole turmeric things is very

1205.82 --> 1213.08
interesting actually

1207.68 --> 1220.1000000000001
it also destroys flora bite Oh God did

1213.08 --> 1223.9399999999998
that too yeah well I used the iodine for

1220.1 --> 1225.81
that really if you want some information

1223.94 --> 1229.0800000000002
there might sound a little bit

1225.81 --> 1232.3799999999999
there but it really does work if you

1229.08 --> 1234.0
want to cleanse yourself completely of I

1232.38 --> 1235.65
mean I haven't used fluoride and there's

1234.0 --> 1238.47
like toothpaste and stuff for like

1235.65 --> 1241.5
donkey's years right my daughter who is

1238.47 --> 1244.22
Stakes has never ever had fluoride

1241.5 --> 1247.44
toothpaste and her teeth are perfect

1244.22 --> 1248.94
okay so the whole the whole thing about

1247.44 --> 1251.49
fluoride in toothpaste is who absolutely

1248.94 --> 1253.31
load of rubbish because my daughter is

1251.49 --> 1255.72
living proof of it and my wife who's a

1253.31 --> 1258.6
microbiologist did a whole thesis on it

1255.72 --> 1261.9
so we know it's absolute nonsense going

1258.6 --> 1265.5
back to the turmeric having lived out in

1261.9 --> 1268.17
India they use a lot of turmeric in all

1265.5 --> 1270.6
their cooking in many many things and

1268.17 --> 1274.17
also in their in their rituals they use

1270.6 --> 1275.79
turmeric but if you if you - if you rub

1274.17 --> 1279.93
I know it sounds a bit odd but if you

1275.79 --> 1281.52
rub turmeric over your forehead right I

1279.93 --> 1283.3200000000002
mean I don't do it no one really bothers

1281.52 --> 1286.41
doing it but if you were to do it this

1283.32 --> 1287.7
is apparently true you rub turmeric on

1286.41 --> 1291.0900000000001
your forehead especially where your

1287.7 --> 1293.43
third eye is it totally totally

1291.09 --> 1295.11
decalcified your pineal gland and after

1293.43 --> 1296.88
about I suppose somebody in their

1295.11 --> 1299.7299999999998
forties if you were to do that on a

1296.88 --> 1300.45
continual basis for about twenty days to

1299.73 --> 1303.84
about a month

1300.45 --> 1308.76
you are totally clear of fluoride what

1303.84 --> 1312.27
yes it's insane the the Indian it's

1308.76 --> 1315.33
awareness no I mean basically brings

1312.27 --> 1317.46
down the calcification yeah but just

1315.33 --> 1319.29
from on your forehead yeah because it

1317.46 --> 1321.51
soaks into your skin you have to wear at

1319.29 --> 1323.19
night you rub it into your forehead you

1321.51 --> 1325.8
wrap a scarf around your head you go to

1323.19 --> 1329.1000000000001
sleep with it Gordon just like yeah I

1325.8 --> 1331.02
think it as well a spoon and you're just

1329.1 --> 1334.11
keeping it there wouldn't that work the

1331.02 --> 1335.73
same obviously taking internally

1334.11 --> 1337.1299999999999
everything obviously as you know taking

1335.73 --> 1340.95
internally benefits everything

1337.13 --> 1344.3100000000002
externally but these these like sad news

1340.95 --> 1346.14
but that's so sorry it's a great story

1344.31 --> 1349.08
but like if you just put it in your

1346.14 --> 1353.5800000000002
mouth it's gonna I get into your nose

1349.08 --> 1355.98
cavity like yeah yeah all I'm doing is

1353.58 --> 1357.83
just relaying what the Guru's do in

1355.98 --> 1360.8600000000001
India and the sad news is

1357.83 --> 1363.23
on their forehead for about a month and

1360.86 --> 1366.32
it basically denoted detoxes your entire

1363.23 --> 1367.49
system of fluoride it was just it was

1366.32 --> 1368.6589999999999
just interesting because of the fact

1367.49 --> 1371.179
that you were talking about turmeric it

1368.659 --> 1372.679
was like oh you know now now's the time

1371.179 --> 1375.6200000000001
for me to get on you know and just have

1372.679 --> 1378.6200000000001
a little little say something about it

1375.62 --> 1381.6789999999999
whether or not that is true I have no

1378.62 --> 1385.4289999999999
idea but I use turmeric a lot and I

1381.679 --> 1387.6200000000001
don't I try and limit my fluoride intake

1385.429 --> 1390.2
as much as possible and there is a

1387.62 --> 1392.87
difference there is a difference you can

1390.2 --> 1394.309
text it completely now you can try all

1392.87 --> 1400.149
these things out even if they sound a

1394.309 --> 1404.389
bit bit crazy but just battery charge it

1400.149 --> 1412.82
all right let me put my am this thing

1404.389 --> 1416.99
back on okay yeah tumeric it's a miracle

1412.82 --> 1421.34
herb and like I follow natural news I

1416.99 --> 1425.21
have for over ten years and every time

1421.34 --> 1428.12
it turns out that tumeric like oh look

1425.21 --> 1430.7
what we found out it can do also and

1428.12 --> 1433.1299999999999
that's been happening like 20 times or

1430.7 --> 1435.71
something over the it can do so many

1433.13 --> 1439.63
things it's just mind boggling it is

1435.71 --> 1442.49
literally a magical transformative herb

1439.63 --> 1447.5
that there's so many incredible things

1442.49 --> 1450.169
it's just unbelievable well I see so

1447.5 --> 1454.73
many people don't really understand that

1450.169 --> 1457.669
a lot of these natural natural herbs and

1454.73 --> 1461.029
plants and all of this very good you

1457.669 --> 1467.51
know and do so many things and people

1461.029 --> 1470.33
poopoo it but what's with some look like

1467.51 --> 1473.2
every herb does have properties does

1470.33 --> 1476.389
have influences but there's just some

1473.2 --> 1487.27
like tumeric that are just off this

1476.389 --> 1491.779
scale things I like I like I like

1487.27 --> 1494.69
turmeric tea you know

1491.779 --> 1497.509
I'm quite fortunate because I live in a

1494.69 --> 1500.3590000000002
place here in England called Glastonbury

1497.509 --> 1502.549
in Gloucester is very very very kind of

1500.359 --> 1504.649
hippie find an alternative and there's a

1502.549 --> 1506.95
lot of people here with them basically

1504.649 --> 1510.109
it's kind of like a melting pot of

1506.95 --> 1511.6390000000001
people seeking truth people seeking

1510.109 --> 1514.129
various forms of spirituality

1511.639 --> 1516.2289999999998
I think there's I think there's every

1514.129 --> 1519.289
kind of spiritual place that you can

1516.229 --> 1521.3300000000002
have in one place you know you've got

1519.289 --> 1523.129
you've got Hinduism you've got you've

1521.33 --> 1524.7189999999998
got ashrams you've got you've got

1523.129 --> 1527.2099999999998
everything here you know it's so there's

1524.719 --> 1528.799
a lot of there's a lot of organic miss

1527.21 --> 1530.3890000000001
there's a lot of healthy eating there's

1528.799 --> 1541.279
a lot of that there's a lot of awareness

1530.389 --> 1543.9499999999998
here influence you know I'm not I don't

1541.279 --> 1546.229
subscribe to any belief system you know

1543.95 --> 1548.599
I'm not I wouldn't have a label myself

1546.229 --> 1552.169
as like a like a Hindu or anything cuz

1548.599 --> 1556.629
I'm not you know I'm really not I'm

1552.169 --> 1559.5490000000002
aware I'm aware of a lot of it you know

1556.629 --> 1561.559
it's like yourself you know you take

1559.549 --> 1563.45
things from various things you find out

1561.559 --> 1567.289
about it you research into it you take

1563.45 --> 1570.349
what you want from it you know yeah

1567.289 --> 1571.58
that's right so there's no one answer

1570.349 --> 1574.399
there are many answers found in

1571.58 --> 1578.4399999999998
everything you know that's right

1574.399 --> 1581.33
so yeah I take things for myself from

1578.44 --> 1584.719
religions and cultures but I also I

1581.33 --> 1588.4089999999999
don't know it's call it a caretaker

1584.719 --> 1592.6090000000002
mindset I also palm there like what does

1588.409 --> 1595.3390000000002
that culture needs to basically transit

1592.609 --> 1598.039
into a better state for this age because

1595.339 --> 1600.879
everything is under pressure so much

1598.039 --> 1605.119
happens everything the cultures are all

1600.879 --> 1607.7289999999998
more feeble you know because so much has

1605.119 --> 1612.1999999999998
changed all the electric electronic

1607.729 --> 1614.599
social media the direct contact like oh

1612.2 --> 1618.1390000000001
many of these cultures have thrived on

1614.599 --> 1619.6689999999999
just being solitary opposing the world

1618.139 --> 1620.9889999999998
and that made everyone really

1619.669 --> 1623.3300000000002
comfortable and tight but now

1620.989 --> 1626.8890000000001
everybody's right in front of you yeah

1623.33 --> 1630.4089999999999
so everything is is more feeble

1626.889 --> 1632.57
culturally so I think all these cultures

1630.409 --> 1635.989
out there they all need some kind of

1632.57 --> 1639.71
spiritual transition from their roots

1635.989 --> 1640.999
that it must be sensible and it can be

1639.71 --> 1644.33
done and that's something that I think

1640.999 --> 1648.71
about it because yeah like for the most

1644.33 --> 1650.6589999999999
important examples would be Islam if

1648.71 --> 1652.999
there's anything under pressure right

1650.659 --> 1655.94
now it's that from all sides from

1652.999 --> 1659.96
engineer outside it's also creates

1655.94 --> 1662.1190000000001
issues it's such a shame that so many

1659.96 --> 1664.8790000000001
people have bought into so many belief

1662.119 --> 1668.48
systems that are just fabrications made

1664.879 --> 1674.57
may created by men seeking power you

1668.48 --> 1676.46
know it depends it all depends that's a

1674.57 --> 1678.649
very superficial thing what I said in

1676.46 --> 1680.8990000000001
the sense that as you know as we all

1678.649 --> 1682.2489999999998
know that there are many many layers to

1680.899 --> 1685.609
the onion you know and there are so many

1682.249 --> 1688.309
onions within the onion well the thing

1685.609 --> 1691.1589999999999
is a religion might have been

1688.309 --> 1693.649
constructed as a mind control mechanism

1691.159 --> 1697.46
yeah but people that take on that

1693.649 --> 1702.2299999999998
religion may bypass it and then create a

1697.46 --> 1704.989
new sensible way within that atmosphere

1702.23 --> 1707.8990000000001
within that culture being and basically

1704.989 --> 1710.809
finding a new form of funding another

1707.899 --> 1713.299
way of Christ within that religion and

1710.809 --> 1715.34
almost every religion has these people

1713.299 --> 1720.4089999999999
and I'm fascinated about that and there

1715.34 --> 1723.4089999999999
is there is the the seed for the

1720.409 --> 1725.8400000000001
transformation because you're out it it

1723.409 --> 1730.279
is gonna collapse completely it is gonna

1725.84 --> 1736.4889999999998
destroy itself all these religions yeah

1730.279 --> 1738.289
yeah yeah yeah I think I mean like you

1736.489 --> 1741.32
in that sense I'm very kind of an

1738.289 --> 1743.48
independent investigator in the sense

1741.32 --> 1745.129
that I would don't want to belong to the

1743.48 --> 1747.159
group think I don't want to belong to a

1745.129 --> 1751.399
group but I like to duck in and duck out

1747.159 --> 1754.3590000000002
you know I mean it's funny actually you

1751.399 --> 1756.6299999999999
know the the John Smith global I thought

1754.359 --> 1760.1999999999998
that was going around Britain

1756.63 --> 1762.0
doing the flatter tour around the UK you

1760.2 --> 1764.79
know with Roxanne and all that lot oh

1762.0 --> 1766.86
right right right yeah yeah that's

1764.79 --> 1768.99
really funny how how there are so many

1766.86 --> 1771.36
so called Flat Earth isn't truth isn't

1768.99 --> 1773.01
and then like you know in the chat rooms

1771.36 --> 1774.54
getting high you know you're part of

1773.01 --> 1777.51
this group or you're part of that group

1774.54 --> 1780.24
they say well no you just you got is so

1777.51 --> 1782.48
wrong you know oh because you went and

1780.24 --> 1784.53
met these people on such-and-such a day

1782.48 --> 1786.0
really they were just coming in to

1784.53 --> 1787.68
Glastonbury man and to be honest with

1786.0 --> 1789.9
you it's cool to meet people that are

1787.68 --> 1791.7
the same mindset and you want to check

1789.9 --> 1792.99
out people and you want to find out if

1791.7 --> 1795.06
they're just like normal human beings

1792.99 --> 1802.77
you know and all this talk of nonsense

1795.06 --> 1805.35
and agents rubbish like that yeah I went

1802.77 --> 1807.0
down there and I'd show these people and

1805.35 --> 1808.83
then it's my whole you ever you feel

1807.0 --> 1810.93
like part of the group now and then you

1808.83 --> 1814.9499999999998
must be an agent now like thank you

1810.93 --> 1817.26
completely insane I know the agent you

1814.95 --> 1820.3700000000001
know I mean no one even asked me to be

1817.26 --> 1820.37
an Asian I mean come on

1820.92 --> 1826.92
and these people aren't agents they're

1824.49 --> 1829.6200000000001
really not I mean and it's like but I

1826.92 --> 1831.03
still don't going back to my point I

1829.62 --> 1832.9199999999998
still wouldn't want to be part of a

1831.03 --> 1835.95
group you know I'd like to get in our

1832.92 --> 1837.8400000000001
chat meet some people share a bit of

1835.95 --> 1842.19
information share a bit of knowledge you

1837.84 --> 1845.22
know and then get out you know well yeah

1842.19 --> 1848.22
being part of a group and staying there

1845.22 --> 1850.23
requires basically having something to

1848.22 --> 1852.15
grow well it doesn't progress does it

1850.23 --> 1854.28
it's like an echo chamber every group

1852.15 --> 1860.8200000000002
becomes an echo chamber you watch these

1854.28 --> 1862.8899999999999
groups just you know they don't even

1860.82 --> 1865.23
know is complete conjecture and then

1862.89 --> 1867.63
just making out like it's the reality

1865.23 --> 1870.74
you know no but that's not the same

1867.63 --> 1872.0100000000002
thing look there is the typical

1870.74 --> 1874.71
conjecture

1872.01 --> 1876.81
then people tend to fall back to when

1874.71 --> 1878.46
you're approaching non flat earthers

1876.81 --> 1880.95
because they don't get it yet and it's

1878.46 --> 1883.98
like this giant staircase of knowledge

1880.95 --> 1886.2
and ways of approach and yeah you start

1883.98 --> 1889.38
with the typical conjecture it's like a

1886.2 --> 1890.52
first response yeah sure Kuehl progress

1889.38 --> 1895.2600000000002
is with

1890.52 --> 1903.96
each other yeah team Mars how did you

1895.26 --> 1909.87
get in here join your crew I how did you

1903.96 --> 1915.24
get this link listen I get to meet

1909.87 --> 1920.04
people's the infamous Dan did you give

1915.24 --> 1924.15
up Mars Lily no III you shared the

1920.04 --> 1928.26
Lincoln hangouts and I saw it and I

1924.15 --> 1933.3600000000001
copied it down on hangouts yeah someone

1928.26 --> 1943.28
shared screen or something what's what

1933.36 --> 1943.28
and earlier in the Hangout okay alright

1944.0 --> 1953.49
that's weird that's weird computers how

1950.76 --> 1956.73
many P Mo's it seems to you I don't know

1953.49 --> 1958.68
man you're all over the place you said I

1956.73 --> 1962.22
used to be more into computers when I

1958.68 --> 1966.3
was younger but I was I went to school

1962.22 --> 1967.83
for computer science for a little bit no

1966.3 --> 1969.87
I'm quite I'm not very good with the

1967.83 --> 1976.6499999999999
ready I kind of know my way around them

1969.87 --> 1978.5
but there's still a bit yeah I'm not

1976.65 --> 1982.2900000000002
very good with them anymore

1978.5 --> 1984.18
they change so fast it's like if you

1982.29 --> 1986.94
don't follow it and keep up to date with

1984.18 --> 1990.68
it you know everything everything you

1986.94 --> 1990.68
know gets outdated really quickly right

1991.61 --> 1996.8999999999999
people sorry I'm looking at various

1993.87 --> 1998.25
things popping up on my screen the mind

1996.9 --> 1998.8200000000002
looks like I'm looking all over the

1998.25 --> 2002.3
place

1998.82 --> 2004.79
alright so P Mars be honest did you get

2002.3 --> 2009.08
the link from danwon field because you

2004.79 --> 2012.25
would do that now then dad didn't give

2009.08 --> 2012.25
me the link all right

2014.079 --> 2022.369
weird well that was really quick a few

2017.149 --> 2024.589
parents II don't know how you got it no

2022.369 --> 2027.589
it's cool man I'm glad I'm glad that I

2024.589 --> 2029.389
put on hero into me you know yeah but

2027.589 --> 2032.329
now haven't I given we were like in the

2029.389 --> 2034.6689999999999
middle of her ago I'm lost where what

2032.329 --> 2038.269
were we talking you guys are talking

2034.669 --> 2040.519
about the ruin second American things

2038.269 --> 2042.169
like that and oh yeah I thought I was

2040.519 --> 2046.339
entering interesting what you're saying

2042.169 --> 2048.529
about the group think about okay I think

2046.339 --> 2051.5
it's bad to join groups I think we

2048.529 --> 2054.679
should encourage independence and

2051.5 --> 2059.329
individualism and it should be okay if

2054.679 --> 2060.589
your table it's nice to meet people it's

2059.329 --> 2063.139
nice to get to know different people

2060.589 --> 2065.24
it's nice to share views and and talk to

2063.139 --> 2067.2200000000003
people that are on similar paths in a

2065.24 --> 2069.319
similar way of lanes because it is and

2067.22 --> 2072.3489999999997
it unifies people otherwise we wouldn't

2069.319 --> 2074.69
be here you know and it's the same in

2072.349 --> 2076.4900000000002
its same obviously outside you know

2074.69 --> 2078.349
outside of the world of computers it's

2076.49 --> 2081.2299999999996
nice to meet with people but what I mean

2078.349 --> 2083.179
is it subscribing to a group and then

2081.23 --> 2085.789
you become the groupthink and meetings

2083.179 --> 2087.44
every week and it's just all of that you

2085.789 --> 2090.099
know it becomes like a big it becomes

2087.44 --> 2094.369
like an organized religion in itself

2090.099 --> 2096.049
yeah and I'm kind of like I always had a

2094.369 --> 2097.4900000000002
tendency to stay away from that but I've

2096.049 --> 2100.25
always been like I've always been the

2097.49 --> 2103.64
one that kind of likes to kind of duck

2100.25 --> 2105.44
in and duck out again you know I like to

2103.64 --> 2109.43
read about psychology and I read that

2105.44 --> 2112.609
people like judged their sanity but

2109.43 --> 2113.8689999999997
based on others around them so if the

2112.609 --> 2115.7
people around them share the same

2113.869 --> 2119.2400000000002
opinion is Amit makes them feel more

2115.7 --> 2120.109
secure and what they think and they feel

2119.24 --> 2123.5
normal

2120.109 --> 2126.519
so I suppose that it depends on the

2123.5 --> 2126.519
person I mean I wouldn't

2126.71 --> 2131.0
test me because no I'm just saying like

2128.66 --> 2133.6099999999997
in general and I read it in a book like

2131.0 --> 2138.26
PP Anna behave like that so will you see

2133.61 --> 2140.75
that people are mentality people do like

2138.26 --> 2143.3
to congregate yeah you see that online

2140.75 --> 2144.92
that's why echo chambers kind of forming

2143.3 --> 2146.63
groups online like people like to group

2144.92 --> 2149.54
up that have the same opinion and then

2146.63 --> 2152.63
so they sit around and talk about how

2149.54 --> 2154.04
the other group is wrong all day okay so

2152.63 --> 2156.77
like what everyone does everyone's

2154.04 --> 2161.0
essentially doing this is the human

2156.77 --> 2164.84
condition you know and and flat earth

2161.0 --> 2167.36
and and globe earth and whatever has

2164.84 --> 2170.09
been the this last four or five years

2167.36 --> 2173.54
has been the one thing that's really

2170.09 --> 2179.51
proven how much we are like that as

2173.54 --> 2181.52
human beings indeed you know we we love

2179.51 --> 2184.1000000000004
it even if we fight against it we

2181.52 --> 2187.16
obviously love it as a species to kind

2184.1 --> 2191.12
of like be divided and to make our

2187.16 --> 2193.25
points and you know we like about UNESCO

2191.12 --> 2195.14
Maps wanna get on the same page but it's

2193.25 --> 2196.91
never gonna happen because everyone is

2195.14 --> 2198.56
coming from their own perspective and

2196.91 --> 2200.75
their own belief system their own

2198.56 --> 2210.23
conditioning their own life of

2200.75 --> 2219.01
experience you know only certain things

2210.23 --> 2222.47
will unify everybody s st unifies people

2219.01 --> 2225.11
yeah when there's no necessity we seek

2222.47 --> 2227.8399999999997
out division to amuse ourselves and

2225.11 --> 2230.42
train our skills you know if there's

2227.84 --> 2231.38
nothing to grow in that's when we get

2230.42 --> 2234.7400000000002
depressed

2231.38 --> 2237.2000000000003
the lack of goal lack of future

2234.74 --> 2243.0499999999997
perspective yeah yeah absolutely it's

2237.2 --> 2244.8799999999997
part of the human nature yeah yeah it's

2243.05 --> 2247.4
an interesting time I must admit it's a

2244.88 --> 2252.5
really interesting time I I question the

2247.4 --> 2255.44
shape of the earth in 1985 there's a 15

2252.5 --> 2258.07
year old about 10,000 feet up in the

2255.44 --> 2258.07
Himalayan foothills

2260.42 --> 2267.309
really mad no one could answer me then

2271.509 --> 2279.44
1985 and then you know what all those

2275.869 --> 2282.589
years later the first video that I ever

2279.44 --> 2284.63
saw online about questioning Cosmo you

2282.589 --> 2290.66
know questioning the cosmology of flower

2284.63 --> 2292.069
was a math power land video this crazy

2290.66 --> 2294.17
notion or something like that

2292.069 --> 2297.38
whose southside doing some painting or

2294.17 --> 2299.17
something talking about the fact that

2297.38 --> 2302.089
the earth wasn't a ball

2299.17 --> 2305.529
and i thought and that was my that was

2302.089 --> 2309.049
my that was my moment you know oh my god

2305.529 --> 2310.97
that takes me straight back to 1985 and

2309.049 --> 2313.13
there's like no way people are talking

2310.97 --> 2314.93
about this now that's insane that's mad

2313.13 --> 2318.7690000000002
man and that's when I really when it

2314.93 --> 2320.569
really hit me you know about four years

2318.769 --> 2321.529
four years ago and I suppose five years

2320.569 --> 2323.5389999999998
four years

2321.529 --> 2325.309
I always knew man you know did you

2323.539 --> 2328.9700000000003
always know that it wasn't what it what

2325.309 --> 2330.8190000000004
they told you well with me it's kind of

2328.97 --> 2333.6189999999997
complicated I had talked about it before

2330.819 --> 2336.019
the elaborate story I've been confronted

2333.619 --> 2339.4990000000003
with it so many times but I just didn't

2336.019 --> 2342.68
believe it mmm was kind of interested in

2339.499 --> 2347.39
it but as an oddity as a little secure

2342.68 --> 2351.5789999999997
lore as I approached it ya never really

2347.39 --> 2351.5789999999997
sank in that it might actually be real

2352.509 --> 2359.089
2015 when like I remember I'm not sure

2357.079 --> 2361.1600000000003
if this is actually physically readable

2359.089 --> 2363.049
that's the problem with me and because

2361.16 --> 2369.22
of my visions but I remember like

2363.049 --> 2374.029
paintings of different shapes earth like

2369.22 --> 2375.9199999999996
mostly like almost like hat shaped that

2374.029 --> 2378.319
was a thing and it was an entire group

2375.92 --> 2382.19
doing that and I saw these paintings

2378.319 --> 2386.5389999999998
like a long time ago Wow what is that

2382.19 --> 2389.2690000000002
that's fascinating like that's just

2386.539 --> 2391.1600000000003
seeing that breaks you out of just the

2389.269 --> 2394.1
conceptualization that it might be

2391.16 --> 2398.6299999999997
anything else than a globe just spy

2394.1 --> 2402.92
Miele I think and now I only realized

2398.63 --> 2404.75
what that could have been yeah so we I

2402.92 --> 2406.4
think I was quite fortunate in the sense

2404.75 --> 2408.11
that growing up I traveled a lot and I

2406.4 --> 2410.78
lived in places like India for a large

2408.11 --> 2413.54
percentage of my youth and a schooling

2410.78 --> 2414.92
so I had a lot of I was at an

2413.54 --> 2416.93
international school so I had a lot of

2414.92 --> 2418.9700000000003
different cultural views and religious

2416.93 --> 2421.97
backgrounds surrounding me so it wasn't

2418.97 --> 2424.24
like one perspective and obviously a lot

2421.97 --> 2427.1299999999997
of the Vedic perspective which is the

2424.24 --> 2429.1699999999996
the belief in the Bou mandala which is

2427.13 --> 2434.1400000000003
which is very much like Martin Kenny's

2429.17 --> 2438.11
work you know their their concept of

2434.14 --> 2441.8599999999997
extra realms more land within this whole

2438.11 --> 2445.78
sort of construct called Abu mandala so

2441.86 --> 2449.15
I always had this very very open kind of

2445.78 --> 2452.09
growing up so my my question I always

2449.15 --> 2455.75
questioned everything and I was never

2452.09 --> 2457.4900000000002
really I never really felt obliged or

2455.75 --> 2459.62
you know I mean I never felt like I owed

2457.49 --> 2460.79
the ball anything or I owed anything to

2459.62 --> 2464.06
anything because I always questioned

2460.79 --> 2465.83
everything I never knew what anything

2464.06 --> 2469.64
really was because my answers were never

2465.83 --> 2471.38
satisfactorily answered by anybody like

2469.64 --> 2475.22
going back so when I said when I was in

2471.38 --> 2477.1400000000003
1985 at 10,000 feet in the Himalayan

2475.22 --> 2479.2099999999996
foothills with my classmates looking

2477.14 --> 2481.54
through a powerful telescope across the

2479.21 --> 2484.82
Himalayan peaks and asking my teacher

2481.54 --> 2488.45
okay so you know knowing that the earth

2484.82 --> 2491.9
curves wired why are the peaks in the

2488.45 --> 2495.5499999999997
distance not curving or not dipping down

2491.9 --> 2498.7400000000002
right and I asked that as a 15 year old

2495.55 --> 2501.11
you know and not not even thinking that

2498.74 --> 2503.3599999999997
the ball that the earth was flat or if

2501.11 --> 2505.73
it was a ball just thinking wait a

2503.36 --> 2507.59
minute my observation is something he's

2505.73 --> 2509.84
telling me something different and what

2507.59 --> 2511.55
you've been telling me now I need to ask

2509.84 --> 2513.56
you why is that that my teacher could

2511.55 --> 2515.36
never answer me said oh oh just you know

2513.56 --> 2517.13
and then as they always do get

2515.36 --> 2522.02
distracted by somebody else in the class

2517.13 --> 2525.38
you know your bishop don't ask questions

2522.02 --> 2526.93
you know just learn it by heart don't

2525.38 --> 2528.849
think about it yeah just

2526.93 --> 2535.1499999999996
just learn it just put it down in the

2528.849 --> 2539.26
test you know yes crazy crazy I'm so

2535.15 --> 2541.6600000000003
glad though now people are really

2539.26 --> 2543.4900000000002
starting to question so many things on

2541.66 --> 2546.1299999999997
so many levels you know I think it's

2543.49 --> 2548.0789999999997
really good and even people not

2546.13 --> 2550.63
naturally questioning types of people

2548.079 --> 2552.67
are starting to I think raise their

2550.63 --> 2554.25
knuckles off the ground and grunting a

2552.67 --> 2557.98
little bit less do you know I may need

2554.25 --> 2560.14
to get the kind of non-thinking people's

2557.98 --> 2568.569
starting to sort of think a little bit

2560.14 --> 2570.49
as well you know yeah you know what I'm

2568.569 --> 2573.4
saying you know yeah they're getting

2570.49 --> 2575.3799999999997
infected by critical thinking yeah yes

2573.4 --> 2577.4500000000003
it's it's the hundred monkey effect

2575.38 --> 2580.0
though isn't it I mean eventually it's

2577.45 --> 2581.23
whether people buy into and believe

2580.0 --> 2585.099
accept it

2581.23 --> 2587.53
whatever it doesn't matter it's it's

2585.099 --> 2590.05
just like media it's just like media

2587.53 --> 2593.17
character characteristics rub off on

2590.05 --> 2595.15
people it's an energy isn't it echoes -

2593.17 --> 2598.119
it's like you say it's a frequency you

2595.15 --> 2599.71
feel it you know it other people might

2598.119 --> 2601.2400000000002
feel it they might not know it yet but

2599.71 --> 2603.089
they will and you know and then it's

2601.24 --> 2607.0299999999997
just it's just a matter of time really

2603.089 --> 2608.92
in the end personal decision also boss

2607.03 --> 2611.079
of course a lot of people find it very

2608.92 --> 2613.54
very hard as we know to shrug off their

2611.079 --> 2615.309
belief systems I mean for me it was just

2613.54 --> 2617.109
it's always been very easy whatever

2615.309 --> 2619.2900000000004
system because I never really had any

2617.109 --> 2622.7799999999997
because I've been bombarded with so many

2619.29 --> 2625.45
you know for some people their religion

2622.78 --> 2627.9
has become of critical importance

2625.45 --> 2631.39
because some people go through like

2627.9 --> 2634.2400000000002
terrible things yeah then their religion

2631.39 --> 2637.0
literally saves their sanity with these

2634.24 --> 2639.2799999999997
people yeah yeah that could even be like

2637.0 --> 2641.859
outer space like I had these times where

2639.28 --> 2644.53
I just felt so terrible so depressed and

2641.859 --> 2647.38
then I would just be watching Saturday

2644.53 --> 2650.8900000000003
morning space cartoons and just becoming

2647.38 --> 2652.569
that and replacing that with the rest of

2650.89 --> 2655.54
my life experience I would just be

2652.569 --> 2657.25
dreaming about that to save me I went

2655.54 --> 2659.19
through a similar thing with like that

2657.25 --> 2661.92
we're not she back in the

2659.19 --> 2665.34
in the early 90s with the whole UFO

2661.92 --> 2667.56
thing you know I really got hold really

2665.34 --> 2671.7000000000003
sucked into that really really sucked

2667.56 --> 2674.42
into the whole UFO thing a lot of don't

2671.7 --> 2678.0299999999997
get me wrong I have seen things that

2674.42 --> 2680.46
that I can't explain but now in

2678.03 --> 2682.4700000000003
retrospect I know that they're probably

2680.46 --> 2690.03
coming from other areas rather than from

2682.47 --> 2691.29
up there the extra dimension physical

2690.03 --> 2695.82
things I think they're coming from other

2691.29 --> 2698.91
areas I my personal view I wouldn't I

2695.82 --> 2702.2400000000002
don't want to say belief but my personal

2698.91 --> 2708.12
view an understanding so far this Flat

2702.24 --> 2710.3399999999997
Earth revelation for me I I think that

2708.12 --> 2712.44
there's more land I I really think

2710.34 --> 2716.28
there's more lands you know I think

2712.44 --> 2720.09
there is a technology core technology

2716.28 --> 2723.65
that is coming from the military so I do

2720.09 --> 2729.17
think it's aliens who know maybe but

2723.65 --> 2732.15
aliens maybe they're extra realm ours as

2729.17 --> 2735.27
people from extra-extra territories

2732.15 --> 2740.79
extra terror israelian you know realm

2735.27 --> 2744.5099999999998
this is they want people to believe

2740.79 --> 2748.11
their space aliens yeah I used to

2744.51 --> 2751.4700000000003
believe that and and then I realized hey

2748.11 --> 2754.3700000000003
wait a second reason suppose people you

2751.47 --> 2757.89
know I was like if the military is

2754.37 --> 2760.47
covering up the fact that aliens are

2757.89 --> 2762.6299999999997
coming to Earth that's what they made it

2760.47 --> 2764.7599999999998
seem like but then the military owned

2762.63 --> 2769.1600000000003
these TV shows that were telling you

2764.76 --> 2772.8300000000004
this so I'm like if the military's cover

2769.16 --> 2778.71
yeah right but yeah it's so secret that

2772.83 --> 2780.39
everybody knows about it do you remember

2778.71 --> 2782.73
back in the day people like Richard

2780.39 --> 2785.37
Hoagland and and all these different

2782.73 --> 2787.56
people you know involved in the secret

2785.37 --> 2790.22
space program turned what's-his-name

2787.56 --> 2798.34
Wilcox they even will

2790.22 --> 2801.98
oh yeah oh it was a edgar cayce

2798.34 --> 2804.32
reincarnated that's a bad break David I

2801.98 --> 2807.109
can people at night you know didn't

2804.32 --> 2810.19
didn't like Antonia super rods have an

2807.109 --> 2813.44
interview with David Wilcox her was dead

2810.19 --> 2816.08
it was a long time ago maybe it was just

2813.44 --> 2823.34
a joke no I don't remember if it wasn't

2816.08 --> 2826.0099999999998
a real thing I would love to talk to him

2823.34 --> 2828.609
I would love to talk to Wilcock or

2826.01 --> 2828.6090000000004
whatever his name is

2830.74 --> 2835.5499999999997
he knows exactly what's going on B's

2833.42 --> 2837.65
because he's pumped up all this rubbish

2835.55 --> 2841.4900000000002
like a decade or so ago he's still

2837.65 --> 2846.5
regurgitating the same rubbish yep oh my

2841.49 --> 2853.2099999999996
god he's got a playbook yeah like all of

2846.5 --> 2856.46
them so yeah so yeah extra lands I think

2853.21 --> 2860.03
if there's it right okay this way right

2856.46 --> 2863.57
if this it might be if there's a creator

2860.03 --> 2864.9500000000003
okay if we're all created right if

2863.57 --> 2868.82
there's a creator call it whatever you

2864.95 --> 2870.08
want right electromagnetism vibration

2868.82 --> 2871.88
whatever you want to call it whatever

2870.08 --> 2875.15
put us here we were obviously created

2871.88 --> 2875.9
somehow right well we were designed we

2875.15 --> 2879.19
were designed

2875.9 --> 2882.14
yeah whatever design suggests yeah

2879.19 --> 2887.93
matter forming or something where there

2882.14 --> 2889.7
was none before whatever you want to put

2887.93 --> 2894.23
it we've been the cosine is a parity

2889.7 --> 2896.1189999999997
there right so okay so who created

2894.23 --> 2898.19
InDesign so if I'm the deep if I'm the

2896.119 --> 2900.05
architect of this of these creations

2898.19 --> 2902.75
right these humans that I've created

2900.05 --> 2904.2200000000003
right and I've had various humans along

2902.75 --> 2906.2
the line we've seen people we've seen

2904.22 --> 2909.29
humans with elongated skulls we've seen

2906.2 --> 2910.7599999999998
different versions of humans right and

2909.29 --> 2912.56
so we are now human whatever

2910.76 --> 2915.44
seven-point-five right so the Creator

2912.56 --> 2919.099
has created this place all humans to

2915.44 --> 2920.7200000000003
have a physical experience right so in

2919.099 --> 2922.1600000000003
order for a humans have a physical

2920.72 --> 2923.5989999999997
experience you're not gonna be able to

2922.16 --> 2924.8289999999997
go up into space

2923.599 --> 2926.21
you're not going to be able to go down

2924.829 --> 2927.259
into the deepest part of the oceans

2926.21 --> 2930.799
because we're not designed to do that

2927.259 --> 2934.999
right you can't go into space we know

2930.799 --> 2937.7889999999998
that okay so a creator knowing that his

2934.999 --> 2940.609
humans creations can't go into space

2937.789 --> 2943.13
because there isn't space this creates

2940.609 --> 2946.989
is going to design a construct where

2943.13 --> 2949.7000000000003
humans will reproduce grow and explore

2946.989 --> 2951.68
humans naturally wants to move outwards

2949.7 --> 2954.799
and explore because that's what humans

2951.68 --> 2958.43
want to do right okay so wouldn't it

2954.799 --> 2960.049
make so much sense the logical thing is

2958.43 --> 2962.029
if you're a create so you create more

2960.049 --> 2964.4
lands you create more than because it's

2962.029 --> 2966.71
physical it's right here it will enable

2964.4 --> 2968.4500000000003
people to just keep going outwards and

2966.71 --> 2970.64
keep exploring and keep moving and keep

2968.45 --> 2972.47
moving and keep moving right by the way

2970.64 --> 2975.5789999999997
that is you know sorry that's not

2972.47 --> 2978.799
exclusively human that's mammal

2975.579 --> 2984.0190000000002
absolutely okay mammal human everything

2978.799 --> 2986.509
that's living breathing you know they

2984.019 --> 2988.1299999999997
want they want to move out another

2986.509 --> 2995.289
species typically you want to do that

2988.13 --> 2997.9990000000003
but generally okay mammals humans

2995.289 --> 2999.829
various groups we want adventure forward

2997.999 --> 3018.1899999999996
we want to explore we want it we want to

2999.829 --> 3019.809
we're curious right imagination there's

3018.19 --> 3021.7000000000003
nothing wrong with conjecture you know

3019.809 --> 3023.529
if I wanted to go into the whole boom

3021.7 --> 3025.1189999999997
annular I say yes there are seven

3023.529 --> 3026.829
dimensions above and there are seven

3025.119 --> 3028.6600000000003
dimensions below and there are beings

3026.829 --> 3030.6090000000004
and there are creatures and there are

3028.66 --> 3031.96
infinite means and infinite uses I mean

3030.609 --> 3034.029
I could say all kinds of stuff forever

3031.96 --> 3037.029
you know but reality being is where I

3034.029 --> 3041.979
here in this reality place and there's

3037.029 --> 3043.66
got to be more of it yeah you know we've

3041.979 --> 3045.249
just been corralled into a barn and I

3043.66 --> 3048.8799999999997
don't understand why people can't get

3045.249 --> 3051.5789999999997
the head around it it's so weird

3048.88 --> 3054.009
well they're already in a barn of their

3051.579 --> 3057.009
own like you have to feel and that the

3054.009 --> 3057.76
entire society is structure eyes to be a

3057.009 --> 3059.26
prison with

3057.76 --> 3063.96
the prison within a prison within in

3059.26 --> 3068.17
prison OSHA Li financially and

3063.96 --> 3071.83
culturally all reinforcements from every

3068.17 --> 3075.31
angle you know be basically in a prison

3071.83 --> 3077.71
life by your own apparent choosing yeah

3075.31 --> 3079.72
so I'm moving around a logo I've got
