let's see if it

156.4 --> 163.36

165.12 --> 168.8
so yeah thank you william thank you a

167.76 --> 170.72
lot

168.8 --> 173.44
and i've already taken a look at the

170.72 --> 177.28
paper quality seems really good it's

173.44 --> 177.28
it's more like a canvas so

178.159 --> 184.56
how do you call it like that special

179.92 --> 187.35999999999999
type of paper with

184.56 --> 189.2
with textile in it like really good

187.36 --> 192.08
quality paper

189.2 --> 194.64
not just some standard print so let's

192.08 --> 194.64000000000001
take a look

207.599 --> 215.2
check that out

212.08 --> 216.959
anyway it's good stuff

215.2 --> 219.599
let's continue with the show before i go

216.959 --> 219.599
all the way there

219.68 --> 223.28
the weather today is completely

221.2 --> 226.48
different that's what i got a sweater on

223.28 --> 229.68
it's since yesterday evening

226.48 --> 232.959
it got it has gotten very stormy

229.68 --> 235.76000000000002
very stormy so oh yeah

232.959 --> 236.64000000000001
my way to groceries today i had kind of

235.76 --> 239.12
a hassle

236.64 --> 240.95899999999997
going through the wind almost getting

239.12 --> 243.04
blown onto the streets and [ __ ]

240.959 --> 245.519
and there were yeah broken off branches

243.04 --> 245.519
everywhere

245.599 --> 249.2
but that's mostly from yesterday evening

247.36 --> 251.76000000000002
when it was really bad it's not

249.2 --> 252.72
so bad now but yeah it's still pretty

251.76 --> 256.239
heavy

252.72 --> 260.239
and the wind is very cold it's

256.239 --> 263.52
it's a bit treacherous so this is not

260.239 --> 267.44
t-shirt weather anymore

263.52 --> 269.52
now there yeah there is some clear spots

267.44 --> 270.479
in between the clouds but even with the

269.52 --> 272.56
sun

270.479 --> 275.36
the wind just cools it off so much it's

272.56 --> 275.36
just not the same

276.639 --> 286.24
anyway so yeah that's the weather

283.84 --> 286.23999999999995
like that

293.759 --> 302.24
right and i have

oprah mukul

399.28 --> 403.44
yeah good to see you all this monday

403.68 --> 409.84000000000003
weekend is over again

410.96 --> 414.23999999999995
you know it's weird for in a way for me

413.199 --> 417.28000000000003
the weekends are

414.24 --> 417.28000000000003
sort of a bit tough

418.0 --> 421.919
because i'm so used to going on to the

420.0 --> 423.44
flat earth debates right after my show

421.919 --> 427.12
normally

423.44 --> 431.36
weekdays that yeah it's

427.12 --> 434.479
it it's like a a spot for me to

431.36 --> 435.68
in a way fent off you know talking for

434.479 --> 438.0
an hour and then

435.68 --> 440.08
do that but in the weekends i yeah

438.0 --> 442.0
there's a longer show

440.08 --> 443.84
and then yeah i can go to chat in a

442.0 --> 445.12
premiere and all that but it's not the

443.84 --> 447.599
same

445.12 --> 449.52
so always slightly slightly frustrating

447.599 --> 452.96
but yeah

449.52 --> 456.4
who cares it's all good

452.96 --> 459.75899999999996
and yeah yesterday that amazing

456.4 --> 459.75899999999996
five hour premiere

460.639 --> 465.759
was pretty astounding

463.68 --> 466.8
and it was great to see it back i it

465.759 --> 471.44
wasn't even there for

466.8 --> 474.0
the entire show when i was on the panel

471.44 --> 476.639
and yeah it was really just going and

474.0 --> 479.44
going and going non-stop

476.639 --> 480.0
pretty astounding like where does energy

479.44 --> 485.039
where does

480.0 --> 489.36
nathan get the energy from and how

485.039 --> 489.36
how low can a baller sink

490.84 --> 497.52
into intellectual oblivion

494.0 --> 499.759
well xanax certainly gave it a a record

497.52 --> 499.75899999999996
go

503.919 --> 507.68
can i see the moon right now no

516.0 --> 521.839
lemon mirthy tea

519.2 --> 521.839
interesting

526.959 --> 532.959
yeah remember also that apparently

530.399 --> 534.48
john had been away for a while and he

532.959 --> 537.5189999999999
had

534.48 --> 541.12
set through a massive storm

537.519 --> 545.2
that like a tornado basically

541.12 --> 548.88
that literally made trees

545.2 --> 552.6400000000001
just jump back and forth like crazy and

548.88 --> 554.48
trash the place so he's been

552.64 --> 556.72
he's been away for a while because there

554.48 --> 559.44
was no power at all no electricity

556.72 --> 562.1600000000001
nothing for weeks

559.44 --> 562.8800000000001
and uh yeah he had that storm that's a

562.16 --> 566.0
while ago

562.88 --> 568.399
well now some kind of a storm is hitting

566.0 --> 569.36
here but it's nothing like a tornado of

568.399 --> 570.64
course

569.36 --> 572.8000000000001
there's no tornadoes here in the

570.64 --> 575.1999999999999
netherlands not like that

572.8 --> 576.399
the worst tornado we've actually seen

575.2 --> 578.24
was at sea

576.399 --> 580.72
like far away from the coast never hit

578.24 --> 580.72
the coast

585.44 --> 589.2
don't think there's any tornadoes in

587.279 --> 592.24
europe like ever

589.2 --> 592.24
it's super rare

592.72 --> 595.12
anyway

600.8 --> 605.8389999999999
hey secret asian man

615.12 --> 619.36
right anyway i'm gonna take a look at

617.04 --> 621.04
those maps

619.36 --> 633.839
after drinking some coffee have to be

621.04 --> 633.8389999999999
careful with that not to spill

643.92 --> 647.8389999999999
oh yeah that's a very familiar one

648.399 --> 654.079
yeah the same one that antonio superlax

653.04 --> 661.8389999999999
has up

654.079 --> 661.8389999999999
at the back of his show for like ever

663.36 --> 666.32
so that's pretty cool

666.72 --> 670.72
it's handy to have it physically

671.519 --> 676.24
it's funny yeah there's this thing here

676.48 --> 681.12
and it's just photographed like this is

679.279 --> 682.48
normally a thing that's attached onto it

681.12 --> 684.399
that you can physically

682.48 --> 689.839
physically move around but it it's just

684.399 --> 689.839
photographed onto it it's hilarious

695.76 --> 703.8389999999999
oh wow geez

700.24 --> 703.839
look at that thing

704.24 --> 706.5600000000001
that's

711.92 --> 717.8389999999999
and this is his star chart

720.16 --> 722.959
pretty incredible

725.519 --> 731.6
and this is all pretty good quality

728.839 --> 734.72
fabric it's like some kind of

731.6 --> 738.5600000000001
hard cloth printed

734.72 --> 738.5600000000001
yeah i can't even call this paper

738.8 --> 741.3599999999999
pretty awesome

742.48 --> 745.839
and you sent me a ton

751.44 --> 759.839
wow he sent me a total of seven maps

756.72 --> 759.839
i think

769.6 --> 774.8000000000001
i'm not even oh yeah it's a

780.32 --> 787.839
it's a astrological chart of the planets

783.92 --> 787.8389999999999
it's a very old one

791.76 --> 794.16
pretty cool

796.32 --> 802.8000000000001
i just told him like wow dude sent me

799.36 --> 804.88
yeah send me whatever you can i'll take

802.8 --> 804.88
it

812.839 --> 815.839
interesting

817.04 --> 826.8389999999999
just for whatever the quality is worth

822.0 --> 829.839
the original it's really beautiful

826.839 --> 829.839
nonetheless

840.839 --> 843.839
cool

855.04 --> 859.8389999999999
this this guy thank you so much man this

857.519 --> 862.8
is just so much

859.839 --> 862.8000000000001
so much stuff

868.639 --> 871.839
there's a lot to study

873.17 --> 876.3399999999999
[Music]

883.6 --> 899.839
all here what's this

900.32 --> 907.519
this one has tartary on it as well

904.72 --> 913.839
it's weird all the ds there that big

907.519 --> 913.839
stretch of land

916.24 --> 922.88
pretty good looking lots of mountain

920.0 --> 922.88
ranges on this one

923.02 --> 928.639
[Music]

924.88 --> 928.639
and then yeah the final one

932.16 --> 941.8389999999999
no idea what this is about yet

935.92 --> 941.8389999999999
it's pretty mysterious

947.519 --> 950.8
figure of the world

952.959 --> 958.2399999999999
i think this is some kind of astral

955.04 --> 958.24
astrological chart

962.88 --> 968.48
it's interesting i think this is like a

966.079 --> 969.5999999999999
mechanical theory for the globe of the

968.48 --> 973.279
heavens

969.6 --> 973.279
i think that is what this represents

975.6 --> 981.36
maybe yeah maybe an early heliocentric

978.88 --> 982.639
system the system of copernicus who

981.36 --> 986.72
holds

982.639 --> 990.24
ee sun is immovable

986.72 --> 994.0
right okay so this is apparently

990.24 --> 997.839
some copernicus's early work

994.0 --> 997.839
good stuff

1000.639 --> 1003.6
so yeah pretty cool

1006.24 --> 1011.839
so yeah hence this show being called i

1008.639 --> 1011.839
got naps

1013.759 --> 1016.5600000000001
oh god

1019.04 --> 1027.6789999999999
so who who cares sorry i guess you care

1024.0 --> 1030.0
the rapture come on

1027.679 --> 1030.0
why

1030.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
what would it matter

1054.48 --> 1067.84
yeah glass y'all pretty cool huh

1073.28 --> 1078.3999999999999
four day night shot what that's

1075.36 --> 1078.3999999999999
upsetting you mean

1079.44 --> 1085.2
the rapture what

1082.64 --> 1085.2
like why

1088.24 --> 1093.2
i i don't get why that would be on

1090.799 --> 1095.6
somebody's mind

1093.2 --> 1096.559
like it sounds very much like the the

1095.6 --> 1099.4399999999998
y2k

1096.559 --> 1101.52
and the 2012 end of the world's like

1099.44 --> 1109.8400000000001
yeah it's coming it's good like

1101.52 --> 1109.84
why why is that on your mind

1117.919 --> 1122.16
like if it was would it make a

1120.08 --> 1125.4399999999998
difference for you to know

1122.16 --> 1125.44
and to talk about it

1126.0 --> 1129.28
would that make some kind of a

1134.84 --> 1137.84
difference

1155.039 --> 1165.84
a light energy

1173.919 --> 1179.8400000000001
getting nothing errors coming i don't

1176.84 --> 1179.84
know

1188.24 --> 1192.16
mount them on the wall it's going to be

1190.84 --> 1197.6789999999999
difficult

1192.16 --> 1202.3200000000002
something uh technically i might have

1197.679 --> 1202.3200000000002
i could do it but i

1204.559 --> 1210.72
i have a thing about walls and hanging

1208.0 --> 1210.72
things on them

1211.12 --> 1218.0
and yeah i'm not too eager to basically

1215.039 --> 1218.72
hang things on my walls again i already

1218.0 --> 1221.84
got a bow

1218.72 --> 1221.84
you know behind me

1224.159 --> 1228.72
because if i have stuffed pictures

1227.28 --> 1230.559
especially

1228.72 --> 1231.919
attention draw and crowded pictures on

1230.559 --> 1234.48
my wall

1231.919 --> 1236.64
it's gonna mean that i at times won't be

1234.48 --> 1238.799
able to have a

1236.64 --> 1240.64
place i could safely stare towards or

1238.799 --> 1242.72
something

1240.64 --> 1248.0800000000002
because there's just stuff trying to

1242.72 --> 1250.0
draw my attention everywhere

1248.08 --> 1253.36
so that's why i typically don't like to

1250.0 --> 1263.84
hang my walls full with stuff

1253.36 --> 1263.84
because it pressures me

1267.93 --> 1273.52
[Music]

1270.72 --> 1276.24
you know like if i'd have multiple rooms

1273.52 --> 1279.44
available to me it would be different

1276.24 --> 1282.4
then i'd probably have a room

1279.44 --> 1283.2
somewhere that i make the big exception

1282.4 --> 1286.24
and then

1283.2 --> 1288.64
exemption and then just put it

1286.24 --> 1290.64
cluster [ __ ] it all full with stuff and

1288.64 --> 1293.679
drawings and

1290.64 --> 1298.0800000000002
yeah like that

1293.679 --> 1298.0800000000002
but not in a room where i where i sleep

1299.36 --> 1305.84
please know

1319.12 --> 1325.6789999999999
hmm interesting secret asian man

1322.159 --> 1325.679
i've seen some pretty interesting

1325.76 --> 1333.84
yeah bow like gun like

1328.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
devices mechanical devices out there

1350.48 --> 1357.3600000000001
i saw like a a

1354.08 --> 1360.799
almost completely wooden

1357.36 --> 1364.24
like crossbow

1360.799 --> 1366.6399999999999
shotgun system once

1364.24 --> 1368.559
very much like a shotgun it's how it

1366.64 --> 1374.64
handles very smooth

1368.559 --> 1377.6789999999999
but it is effectively a crossbow

1374.64 --> 1378.7990000000002
anyway i don't have money for that kind

1377.679 --> 1389.8400000000001
of thing

1378.799 --> 1389.84
or a place to store it

1399.679 --> 1403.2800000000002
no not multiple projectiles not no no no

1402.64 --> 1406.96
not a

1403.28 --> 1409.9189999999999
not the ammo it's just that the way

1406.96 --> 1412.4
it handles is like a crossbow or like a

1409.919 --> 1416.0800000000002
shotgun

1412.4 --> 1419.52
it still shoots one bolt at a time but

1416.08 --> 1419.52
it can reload really quickly

1423.919 --> 1426.88
right pump action

1427.679 --> 1431.8400000000001
anyway uh

1434.08 --> 1438.559
yeah sorry good servant if i uh kind of

1436.88 --> 1442.24
slapped

1438.559 --> 1442.24
lashed out a little about the whole

1443.2 --> 1447.52
what is it said it call again

1448.799 --> 1454.8799999999999
the rapture because technically yeah

1453.12 --> 1456.32
i don't really believe in the rapture

1454.88 --> 1459.5200000000002
that much when

1456.32 --> 1464.72
in a physical literal sense

1459.52 --> 1464.72
you know and just

1466.24 --> 1470.0
like the whole thing every like just

1469.039 --> 1473.2
what it does

1470.0 --> 1475.2
to people just shows me

1473.2 --> 1477.3600000000001
that i don't think that's part of the

1475.2 --> 1480.72
original essence

1477.36 --> 1482.6399999999999
because what it does with you when you

1480.72 --> 1486.08
occupy your mind with

1482.64 --> 1489.44
that is different

1486.08 --> 1492.0
as with other elements

1489.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
like jesus christ and his path

1492.0 --> 1506.32
specifically in his life

1501.84 --> 1509.369
this place gets worriful now

1506.32 --> 1509.369
[Music]

1512.64 --> 1518.159
maybe maybe in a way but at the same

1516.24 --> 1520.559
time you could consider that it was

1518.159 --> 1523.919
always this evil it's just becoming more

1520.559 --> 1523.9189999999999
apparent to you now

1524.0 --> 1529.84
because you can distinguish

1527.12 --> 1529.84
better

1536.08 --> 1539.84
because when you're really sunk deep

1538.159 --> 1542.0800000000002
into the

1539.84 --> 1543.84
other side into the going along to get

1542.08 --> 1546.8799999999999
along

1543.84 --> 1549.279
mind control top down system

1546.88 --> 1551.919
you overlook all kinds of things and

1549.279 --> 1552.72
automatically make excuses for them

1551.919 --> 1556.64
thereby

1552.72 --> 1557.919
not recognizing their potential

1556.64 --> 1560.5590000000002
nefarious load

1557.919 --> 1564.0800000000002
as it were you just do that and you

1560.559 --> 1566.48
don't remember it as such

1564.08 --> 1567.9189999999999
so you literally you that kind of [ __ ]

1566.48 --> 1571.279
could have sort of

1567.919 --> 1573.3600000000001
come by for years and years and years

1571.279 --> 1574.559
and you would have just never noticed

1573.36 --> 1576.9599999999998
not really

1574.559 --> 1579.279
just thought differently about it that

1576.96 --> 1581.039
happens to a lot of people

1579.279 --> 1582.64
and yeah then when they wake up they

1581.039 --> 1586.08
suddenly find out

1582.64 --> 1588.24
like how bad it has been for a really

1586.08 --> 1591.279
long time already it's just

1588.24 --> 1594.799
become more frequently put out there now

1591.279 --> 1598.0
more openly but it was

1594.799 --> 1601.12
always like that anyway

1598.0 --> 1601.12
it's just more hidden

1608.32 --> 1613.84
gonna get to what tom parker

1617.039 --> 1620.24
okay good servant that's

1623.52 --> 1629.679
i don't know when somebody tells me that

1625.6 --> 1629.6789999999999
that kind of makes me worry about them a

1638.84 --> 1641.84
little

1666.84 --> 1669.84
right

1672.88 --> 1676.24
i don't know what it is good servant

1674.559 --> 1679.36
like why you would say it's so

1676.24 --> 1681.36
extreme like that it almost it kind of

1679.36 --> 1683.6
reminds me that

1681.36 --> 1686.0
yeah even if everything in your life

1683.6 --> 1688.7199999999998
goes absolutely fantastic and you

1686.0 --> 1690.24
you know more than ever that you're like

1688.72 --> 1691.76
really on the right track

1690.24 --> 1694.0
that doesn't mean that you're not going

1691.76 --> 1697.76
to be experiencing some kind of pain

1694.0 --> 1699.36
of any kind and

1697.76 --> 1701.2
i don't know when somebody says it like

1699.36 --> 1701.6789999999999
that it gives me the feeling like you're

1701.2 --> 1704.88
almost

1701.679 --> 1708.8400000000001
using your trust in

1704.88 --> 1712.24
in everything in the in god to try to

1708.84 --> 1715.1999999999998
escape from any

1712.24 --> 1715.2
yeah issue

1715.76 --> 1720.24
that's getting in the way that you kind

1717.76 --> 1723.76
of have trouble dealing with because you

1720.24 --> 1726.32
yeah you were enjoying just the peak

1723.76 --> 1727.52
logos energy right well it doesn't work

1726.32 --> 1729.6789999999999
that way

1727.52 --> 1732.24
because that peak logos energy is not an

1729.679 --> 1733.76
energy that you can always be at

1732.24 --> 1735.919
you're still a human being you still

1733.76 --> 1736.559
have your challenges you have your ego

1735.919 --> 1739.6000000000001
and

1736.559 --> 1741.6
if you peak too long the ego responds it

1739.6 --> 1742.1589999999999
always happens there is no getting away

1741.6 --> 1746.7199999999998
from it

1742.159 --> 1746.72
ever not until you die

1746.799 --> 1753.84
right so

1750.64 --> 1755.279
yeah if somebody says oh i'm i'm real

1753.84 --> 1757.9189999999999
i'm so ready to just

1755.279 --> 1760.559
go to him right now i i ache to be there

1757.919 --> 1762.48
that gives me feeling like wow that's

1760.559 --> 1764.96
that means you're not doing very good at

1762.48 --> 1766.799
this moment

1764.96 --> 1768.24
are you under such stress that you're in

1766.799 --> 1770.559
such a rush

1768.24 --> 1770.559
you know

1777.279 --> 1784.96
oh you just got me a picture tom

1781.44 --> 1789.3600000000001
all right all right

1784.96 --> 1792.64
picture of the moon in the daylight

1789.36 --> 1796.32
well i've seen a lot of day moon

1792.64 --> 1799.679
sightings in the in the last month

1796.32 --> 1799.6789999999999
like in between the clouds and

1806.84 --> 1809.84
everything

1814.32 --> 1819.039
okay good servant well if you really

1816.159 --> 1819.0390000000002
feel happy that

1819.919 --> 1826.3990000000001
that should show

1823.6 --> 1826.399
shall not tell

1826.64 --> 1829.44
oh that's all right

1831.039 --> 1834.1589999999999
just do my show with tom i have a kid

1833.6 --> 1837.12
yeah

1834.159 --> 1840.0800000000002
yeah your show you guys are now doing a

1837.12 --> 1840.08
daily show aren't you

1841.52 --> 1851.84
because i see a new upload almost every

1843.919 --> 1851.8400000000001
other day now

1862.84 --> 1865.84
hmm

1869.44 --> 1873.039
ah that's a very very good point secret

1872.559 --> 1876.24
agent

1873.039 --> 1876.24
secret asian man has

1876.64 --> 1883.679
has some seriously crushing insights

1880.0 --> 1883.679
like i haven't seen him in a while but

1884.64 --> 1888.48
like in chat yesterday too man he's

1887.44 --> 1893.8400000000001
saying a lot of

1888.48 --> 1893.84
very good things

1899.76 --> 1904.84
like he's channeling bruce lee or

1902.42 --> 1907.8400000000001
[Music]

1904.84 --> 1907.84
something

1935.4 --> 1938.449
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1953.76
ah

1948.159 --> 1953.7600000000002
yep yeah that's what happens

1954.72 --> 1960.32
in a way i've been doing that too it's

1956.399 --> 1960.32
just that i'm noticing this from you now

1960.559 --> 1964.32
like yeah if you really start to

1962.72 --> 1966.08
[Music]

1964.32 --> 1967.6789999999999
take your ego out of it and really

1966.08 --> 1970.72
realize that

1967.679 --> 1973.039
it's all god through you and all that

1970.72 --> 1975.1200000000001
and that it is connected and all that

1973.039 --> 1979.039
then yeah the synchronicities

1975.12 --> 1980.799
with everyone else synchronicities in

1979.039 --> 1982.799
media but even with people

1980.799 --> 1985.36
and how they think it starts to get

1982.799 --> 1987.36
overwhelming and just notice like

1985.36 --> 1988.7199999999998
yeah we're supposedly all individuals

1987.36 --> 1991.279
right

1988.72 --> 1992.159
until you figure out that you really

1991.279 --> 1995.6
aren't

1992.159 --> 1998.159
really but you could and probably

1995.6 --> 1999.84
should think of yourselves as

1998.159 --> 2005.8400000000001
individuals

1999.84 --> 2005.84
because this is better for our instincts

2006.08 --> 2019.84
it really comes down to that

2022.159 --> 2025.6000000000001
but yeah information you know it's not

2025.2 --> 2027.6000000000001
as

2025.6 --> 2030.399
flexible in all directions as one would

2027.6 --> 2033.9189999999999
think like logic

2030.399 --> 2035.6
and just natural laws they bring

2033.919 --> 2039.44
everything towards the same

2035.6 --> 2042.6399999999999
directions always so

2039.44 --> 2043.3600000000001
i guess that once the controllers the

2042.64 --> 2047.6000000000001
power

2043.36 --> 2051.1189999999997
hovers the whatever's realized this

2047.6 --> 2052.48
they could simply set out a path and

2051.119 --> 2056.8790000000004
perfectly predict

2052.48 --> 2056.879
everything that would come from

2057.679 --> 2063.44
a complete set of information of an era

2061.119 --> 2064.7200000000003
how it develops how people naturally

2063.44 --> 2067.919
respond to each

2064.72 --> 2071.1189999999997
step of the development put out

2067.919 --> 2073.52
some of them may naturally develop it

2071.119 --> 2074.7200000000003
parallel to the revelation as it is

2073.52 --> 2076.24
being given

2074.72 --> 2078.48
but all these things that are being put

2076.24 --> 2078.7999999999997
out there they've all been pre-developed

2078.48 --> 2082.48
like

2078.8 --> 2085.679
everything so they they can yeah

2082.48 --> 2088.0
even like step ahead they could

2085.679 --> 2090.48
like step ahead technically a hundred

2088.0 --> 2093.119
years into things that

2090.48 --> 2094.96
that shouldn't exist yet but they will

2093.119 --> 2097.76
be at some point

2094.96 --> 2099.52
because that's what i think how they

2097.76 --> 2102.96
really operate

2099.52 --> 2105.92
they've just mastered a certain era of

2102.96 --> 2107.28
information and technology very very

2105.92 --> 2110.8
very early on

2107.28 --> 2113.92
and then they design a

2110.8 --> 2119.28
a plan a rollout plan for it all

2113.92 --> 2122.48
and that guides the entire industrial

2119.28 --> 2126.8
and scientific development of

2122.48 --> 2130.32
the world through that plan

2126.8 --> 2133.04
in the hands of well a few

2130.32 --> 2133.6800000000003
that don't really change it because it

2133.04 --> 2135.92
is so

2133.68 --> 2139.7599999999998
far out of reach of any simple

2135.92 --> 2143.28
individual really it's designed by

2139.76 --> 2146.96
i don't know who mega computer

2143.28 --> 2148.32
satan himself god this is a controlled

2146.96 --> 2151.599
opposition action

2148.32 --> 2154.32
you know something brilliant and

2151.599 --> 2156.1600000000003
it's like probably been introduced way

2154.32 --> 2156.4
before most people that are now wielding

2156.16 --> 2160.0789999999997
it

2156.4 --> 2163.04
were even alive so how could you even

2160.079 --> 2164.5600000000004
think of tampering with that overarching

2163.04 --> 2167.92
plan

2164.56 --> 2168.32
without some major lash back unless you

2167.92 --> 2170.96
are

2168.32 --> 2172.6400000000003
like like uh screw everything i'm gonna

2170.96 --> 2175.52
do whatever i want

2172.64 --> 2176.48
and be irresponsible but yeah can you

2175.52 --> 2179.68
even evade

2176.48 --> 2181.2
or will the people that are immersed in

2179.68 --> 2182.96
this plan because that's what they've

2181.2 --> 2184.56
been raised by by everything is being

2182.96 --> 2187.2
revealed step by step

2184.56 --> 2188.48
generation by generation they will

2187.2 --> 2193.2
simply any

2188.48 --> 2195.359
party up there that will try to bypass

2193.2 --> 2197.359
break that plan the people will

2195.359 --> 2198.56
naturally having been raised with that

2197.359 --> 2200.96
plan

2198.56 --> 2201.68
naturally respond like that's a natural

2200.96 --> 2203.359
because

2201.68 --> 2206.72
this is how it worked this is where it's

2203.359 --> 2209.2799999999997
going you can do that

2206.72 --> 2210.24
so yeah the people will by their

2209.28 --> 2212.599
conditioning

2210.24 --> 2214.0
as part of the massive

2212.599 --> 2217.3590000000004
multi-generational plan

2214.0 --> 2220.96
just naturally respond in a way to

2217.359 --> 2224.0789999999997
prevent potential safe plan satanist

2220.96 --> 2227.119
plan knowers that want to

2224.079 --> 2228.48
alter it radically it will just get them

2227.119 --> 2231.52
out of the way

2228.48 --> 2232.32
and that's how it can't be changed in a

2231.52 --> 2234.56
way

2232.32 --> 2234.56
see

2240.24 --> 2244.8799999999997
i'm talking not talking about god's plan

2242.4 --> 2249.119
i'm talking about the industrial

2244.88 --> 2252.6400000000003
development information rollout plan

2249.119 --> 2254.1600000000003
of the entire world for at least the

2252.64 --> 2257.52
last hundred years

2254.16 --> 2260.0
probably a lot more but significantly

2257.52 --> 2262.72
last 100 years because so many technolo

2260.0 --> 2264.4
technology things were revealed yet

2262.72 --> 2268.24
there were clear signs that it

2264.4 --> 2271.839
was way further developed earlier

2268.24 --> 2275.5989999999997
and it was all being held back

2271.839 --> 2277.92
like a roll-out plan there are any signs

2275.599 --> 2277.92
of this

2279.2 --> 2285.839
it's yeah i don't know this is an idea

2282.48 --> 2285.839
that i've had

2292.24 --> 2296.3199999999997
so this industrial technology reveal

2295.2 --> 2298.3999999999996
plan it's not

2296.32 --> 2300.0
god's plan you know god's plan is

2298.4 --> 2303.04
ethereal

2300.0 --> 2308.0
god's plan is about

2303.04 --> 2308.0
the consciousness and the learning and

2308.24 --> 2314.7999999999997
and the soul and all that

2311.599 --> 2317.76
that yeah but this this plan

2314.8 --> 2321.28
is the technology development and

2317.76 --> 2321.28
information rollout plan

2323.119 --> 2327.359
and there have been clear gravel

2325.2 --> 2330.56
elements

2327.359 --> 2331.839
part of that from the start because

2330.56 --> 2334.48
they've had a hand in

2331.839 --> 2335.7599999999998
this the grapplers the ones that want to

2334.48 --> 2338.079
twist things and

2335.76 --> 2340.079
corrupt people and they've introduced a

2338.079 --> 2342.079
lot of nonsense information in there and

2340.079 --> 2345.44
twisted things

2342.079 --> 2349.3590000000004
to reinforce virtual

2345.44 --> 2352.4
teachings that have are become

2349.359 --> 2354.56
that have become part of this big plan

2352.4 --> 2357.76
and that includes the idea of viruses

2354.56 --> 2360.4
includes the idea of space and space

2357.76 --> 2360.4
technology

2361.04 --> 2365.52
it's all woven in that same plan

2366.16 --> 2370.96
so it's like roll outs in the future the

2368.8 --> 2373.76
revel yeah technological plan

2370.96 --> 2373.76
revelations

2374.0 --> 2383.68
will always include the virtual nonsense

2377.28 --> 2387.2000000000003
as well

2383.68 --> 2390.3199999999997
like and yeah supposed to pandemic

2387.2 --> 2396.7999999999997
virus outbreaks

2390.32 --> 2400.079
and then ridiculous responses to it

2396.8 --> 2401.52
and more mass animal genocide garbage

2400.079 --> 2404.1600000000003
and all that

2401.52 --> 2404.16
disgusting

2405.44 --> 2411.52
that's woven into that same

2409.28 --> 2412.8
roll out plan as well there's virtual

2411.52 --> 2416.96
[ __ ] there's like

2412.8 --> 2420.0
grabble opportunities woven into it

2416.96 --> 2423.68
and that's part of that plan as well

2420.0 --> 2427.119
see so it's definitely not god's plan

2423.68 --> 2429.2799999999997
unless you consider that god is simply

2427.119 --> 2431.599
allowing this to happen and maybe even

2429.28 --> 2436.079
designed it as a controlled opposition

2431.599 --> 2440.1600000000003
proposition with the dark ones that

2436.079 --> 2440.1600000000003
want to defy logos

2442.72 --> 2447.7599999999998
because i do think that god is

2444.56 --> 2450.64
absolutely omnipotent

2447.76 --> 2451.76
and i think he would actually do this

2450.64 --> 2455.2
kind of thing even though

2451.76 --> 2458.3190000000004
it seems yeah because yeah you know

2455.2 --> 2461.1189999999997
alpha omega all things

2458.319 --> 2463.52
and sometimes when i think about that if

2461.119 --> 2464.8
you start to personify like the devil or

2463.52 --> 2467.28
satan

2464.8 --> 2468.5600000000004
as a entity with its own type of

2467.28 --> 2472.48
consciousness

2468.56 --> 2475.599
i get the feeling every time that

2472.48 --> 2477.52
he really would be a servant to

2475.599 --> 2479.52
the mighty one he would be constantly

2477.52 --> 2483.68
aware of that he would just be

2479.52 --> 2486.72
pissed off and just try to get away

2483.68 --> 2487.04
from that absolute realization that he's

2486.72 --> 2489.9199999999996
in

2487.04 --> 2491.2799999999997
nothing that he is a servant that all

2489.92 --> 2495.119
this power he

2491.28 --> 2497.76
yeah he sort of has in its smarts

2495.119 --> 2498.56
it's it's really worth nothing to him

2497.76 --> 2501.8390000000004
because

2498.56 --> 2505.359
yeah the creator is right there so

2501.839 --> 2508.319
any fur power that the devil may have

2505.359 --> 2511.2
will always come from getting the

2508.319 --> 2514.319
consciousness away

2511.2 --> 2517.9199999999996
from that that's for himself

2514.319 --> 2520.64
and for those among people that

2517.92 --> 2521.52
have that same tendency just don't know

2520.64 --> 2524.0
about

2521.52 --> 2525.839
the creator about god about having

2524.0 --> 2528.079
responsibility for their soul and all

2525.839 --> 2528.0789999999997
that

2534.839 --> 2537.839
um

2548.24 --> 2552.4799999999996
that's an interesting concept secret

2550.48 --> 2556.88
asian man

2552.48 --> 2556.88
there there may be something to that

2558.48 --> 2565.839
yeah because hey knowledge is power too

2562.079 --> 2569.52
and hey power corrupts

2565.839 --> 2573.04
it's dangerous if you can't handle

2569.52 --> 2573.68
the knowledge then that knowledge will

2573.04 --> 2579.839
make

2573.68 --> 2579.839
you grabble yourself

2581.599 --> 2589.599
and yeah people that

2585.839 --> 2590.88
that yeah are lucky to have situations

2589.599 --> 2593.119
in their lives where they

2590.88 --> 2595.76
experience this and then learn from it

2593.119 --> 2601.839
in order to get away from that because

2595.76 --> 2601.8390000000004
most they get stuck and they don't come

2604.839 --> 2607.839
back

2610.56 --> 2614.72
it's like the power of control through

2613.839 --> 2618.7999999999997
knowing is

2614.72 --> 2621.5989999999997
yeah once you get the taste of that

2618.8 --> 2622.1600000000003
of the the power allure of the dark side

2621.599 --> 2624.4
of that

2622.16 --> 2635.839
once you get a taste for that it's so

2624.4 --> 2635.839
hard to step away from it

2645.92 --> 2650.64
no you have but now secret asian man is

2648.24 --> 2663.839
just a three thing a three

2650.64 --> 2663.839
free thinker kind of like me

2684.07 --> 2691.839
[Music]

2686.0 --> 2691.839
all right

2698.72 --> 2705.839
yeah secret asian man is saying a lot of

2700.48 --> 2705.839
crushing things

2720.72 --> 2724.56
thinking with your ego well that's it's

2723.359 --> 2727.5989999999997
interesting

2724.56 --> 2728.319
you say that you know thinking is a

2727.599 --> 2731.599
process

2728.319 --> 2731.599
it's your consciousness

2731.68 --> 2738.72
that utilizes the thinking

2735.76 --> 2739.76
but it is what will the thought be used

2738.72 --> 2743.1189999999997
for

2739.76 --> 2746.2400000000002
is it what is the will

2743.119 --> 2747.28
that drives the thought specifically now

2746.24 --> 2751.2
if that's

2747.28 --> 2754.5600000000004
control it's like hunger that's a hunger

2751.2 --> 2757.839
so that that the essence behind

2754.56 --> 2759.839
the the process the driving force behind

2757.839 --> 2762.72
the type of thinking

2759.839 --> 2763.52
is really what matters not even the

2762.72 --> 2767.2
thinking

2763.52 --> 2770.56
thinking is a tool it's secondary it's

2767.2 --> 2773.839
all about the will

2770.56 --> 2775.04
that drives the process of the thinking

2773.839 --> 2776.88
why are you thinking

2775.04 --> 2779.839
what are you thinking for what are you

2776.88 --> 2779.839
thinking towards

2786.88 --> 2793.76
but yeah you feel this while the actual

2790.24 --> 2795.9199999999996
conscious experience looks

2793.76 --> 2798.3190000000004
and focuses often on the technicals

2795.92 --> 2802.4
within the thinking

2798.319 --> 2804.4
and not so much on the field so you

2802.4 --> 2806.1600000000003
yeah the thinking process and the

2804.4 --> 2810.96
technical elements about it can

2806.16 --> 2817.2799999999997
distract you from the field that you

2810.96 --> 2831.2
have while doing it

2817.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
it's it can get pretty complex

2831.2 --> 2845.839
in the thirst right

2847.92 --> 2853.76
the thirst or the question like

2851.28 --> 2854.3190000000004
the thinking process you could consider

2853.76 --> 2858.7200000000003
that it

2854.319 --> 2860.4
always triggers after a question is ask

2858.72 --> 2862.3999999999996
that's when the thinking initiates to

2860.4 --> 2866.319
find an answer to that question

2862.4 --> 2866.88
so look if you before starting the

2866.319 --> 2869.44
thinking

2866.88 --> 2870.559
look if you can clearly isolate what the

2869.44 --> 2873.839
question is and what the

2870.559 --> 2876.96
essence of the question really is why

2873.839 --> 2878.64
is it there what does it feel towards

2876.96 --> 2880.48
what's it gonna reach

2878.64 --> 2882.24
then get the essence of the question and

2880.48 --> 2884.839
then you know

2882.24 --> 2887.839
what is guiding you in that thinking

2884.839 --> 2887.839
process

2894.67 --> 2899.52
[Music]

2897.52 --> 2901.839
this is also how you learn to

2899.52 --> 2901.839
distinguish

2902.64 --> 2905.7599999999998
trains of thoughts and directions that

2904.88 --> 2908.559
could be

2905.76 --> 2909.76
that could lead to savogne type syndrome

2908.559 --> 2912.88
behavior

2909.76 --> 2915.5200000000004
because so foreign typically

2912.88 --> 2917.2000000000003
have their minds stuck in very specific

2915.52 --> 2919.7599999999998
type of thinking routines

2917.2 --> 2921.04
with specific objectives how can i take

2919.76 --> 2924.7200000000003
this person down

2921.04 --> 2927.839
how can i dominate over them

2924.72 --> 2928.72
how can i out-master them and make them

2927.839 --> 2931.7599999999998
look like a fool

2928.72 --> 2934.3999999999996
that's also

2931.76 --> 2936.2400000000002
a force driving thought that could get

2934.4 --> 2938.64
pretty intense thought you could get

2936.24 --> 2939.5989999999997
really obsessive uh constructive and

2938.64 --> 2942.16
powerful at

2939.599 --> 2944.079
it but what is driving it well what's

2942.16 --> 2946.64
driving it is the ego

2944.079 --> 2947.119
an ego that's just for you that just

2946.64 --> 2949.44
wants

2947.119 --> 2950.2400000000002
you to be better looking than the other

2949.44 --> 2952.88
guy

2950.24 --> 2953.52
for the long term purposes to build

2952.88 --> 2956.7200000000003
yourself

2953.52 --> 2959.2
up to get more power whatever but that's

2956.72 --> 2962.24
what's driving that and that's savonier

2959.2 --> 2962.24
type of motivation

2962.48 --> 2966.079
so it's it's very important to figure

2964.8 --> 2968.4
out

2966.079 --> 2970.0
what is driving your thought because

2968.4 --> 2971.359
once you start to really recognize it

2970.0 --> 2974.88
you can also recognize

2971.359 --> 2975.92
when you for example a thought pops in

2974.88 --> 2978.7200000000003
your head

2975.92 --> 2980.16
that drives you toward a paranoid train

2978.72 --> 2984.64
of thought

2980.16 --> 2987.7599999999998
because if you have this

2984.64 --> 2988.8799999999997
initial thought recognize recognization

2987.76 --> 2992.079
system

2988.88 --> 2994.7200000000003
then you immediately know it's like no

2992.079 --> 2996.559
that's gonna lead to this type so before

2994.72 --> 2999.5989999999997
you even

2996.559 --> 3001.92
look consciously into the thought that

2999.599 --> 3003.839
pops that's arriving to your

3001.92 --> 3007.6800000000003
consciousness before you allow

3003.839 --> 3009.7599999999998
to actually look into it you can feel it

3007.68 --> 3011.68
and you can reject it before it actually

3009.76 --> 3014.0
enters your consciousness

3011.68 --> 3015.9199999999996
it's a trick that i've been trying to

3014.0 --> 3018.079
master more and more because yeah that

3015.92 --> 3020.2400000000002
[ __ ] happens a lot things just pop in my

3018.079 --> 3022.48
mind

3020.24 --> 3023.839
sometimes very aggressive thoughts are

3022.48 --> 3028.559
very

3023.839 --> 3028.5589999999997
invasive type of ideas

3029.28 --> 3035.6800000000003
and this way i can yeah recognize it

3033.2 --> 3037.9199999999996
before i even engage

3035.68 --> 3039.1189999999997
just with the feel of it i can recognize

3037.92 --> 3043.359
where it's gonna

3039.119 --> 3046.559
go what hormones will be

3043.359 --> 3047.52
triggered when i truly engage can detect

3046.559 --> 3051.52
that

3047.52 --> 3056.16
and then say nope reject

3051.52 --> 3056.16
like full reject like not

3056.8 --> 3063.92
like that's not gonna be

3060.559 --> 3065.8390000000004
i erase that whatever it is

3063.92 --> 3067.6800000000003
because of the feel and the intentions

3065.839 --> 3071.2
that come with it

3067.68 --> 3074.3999999999996
i erase that not that inside

3071.2 --> 3077.04
whatever was gonna arrive

3074.4 --> 3078.079
if it feels yeah in a way that you

3077.04 --> 3083.839
recognize and

3078.079 --> 3083.8390000000004
know where it's gonna go at

3094.839 --> 3097.839
right

3099.839 --> 3104.64
what jim jones why would you do that

3109.359 --> 3114.5589999999997
oh i'm perfectly happy at you good

3111.44 --> 3114.559
servant don't worry about it

3115.92 --> 3119.28
it's just that i sometimes get the

3117.839 --> 3122.319
feeling you're

3119.28 --> 3122.3190000000004
like maybe

3122.839 --> 3126.72
enjoying enjoying it all a little bit

3125.76 --> 3129.76
too much that

3126.72 --> 3130.5589999999997
that's not like a grappler tendency it's

3129.76 --> 3132.96
just that hey

3130.559 --> 3133.92
if you drown in euphoria because you've

3132.96 --> 3135.839
managed to

3133.92 --> 3139.2000000000003
to fix a couple of things if you drown

3135.839 --> 3143.44
into in the euphoria of it too much

3139.2 --> 3146.7999999999997
lucifer takes over this is fundamental

3143.44 --> 3150.319
so it worries me to see you well

3146.8 --> 3152.559
gush a little about your faith

3150.319 --> 3154.8
it's like that to me that's a worrying

3152.559 --> 3154.8
sign

3155.52 --> 3159.359
because i'm not worried about your

3157.2 --> 3161.359
nature you're definitely a good guy

3159.359 --> 3164.0789999999997
you have a lot of good will you have a

3161.359 --> 3167.359
lot of purity

3164.079 --> 3171.04
but yeah sometimes it seems like

3167.359 --> 3174.96
you're overwhelmed in a positive way and

3171.04 --> 3174.96
that's not necessarily a good thing

3177.52 --> 3180.72
you know i always say even towards

3179.92 --> 3183.2000000000003
myself

3180.72 --> 3186.16
the biggest dangers are when everything

3183.2 --> 3186.16
is going great

3188.48 --> 3198.16
because handing handling difficulties

3193.44 --> 3201.2000000000003
is challenging rewarding

3198.16 --> 3202.16
you you know what you got but when

3201.2 --> 3205.68
everything goes

3202.16 --> 3210.319
great and you get unexpected

3205.68 --> 3210.319
strength growth power inside

3210.48 --> 3213.76
that's more dangerous

3213.839 --> 3217.52
because you will change in the process

3216.64 --> 3220.0
and

3217.52 --> 3221.04
the more you're overwhelmed the more the

3220.0 --> 3224.079
wilder

3221.04 --> 3227.68
the growth will be and with a was

3224.079 --> 3231.079
personal wild growth the ego grows

3227.68 --> 3236.319
equally this always happens always

3231.079 --> 3239.44
always so that's

3236.319 --> 3242.079
yeah here that's

3239.44 --> 3243.04
exactly also the reason why i'm a slow

3242.079 --> 3246.6400000000003
grower

3243.04 --> 3250.88
like i do that on purpose to avoid

3246.64 --> 3254.0
things like that

3250.88 --> 3257.359
i just trust the steady growth

3254.0 --> 3260.16
slowly intuitively

3257.359 --> 3260.16
keep it slow

3261.359 --> 3267.359
because if you burst out too quickly

3264.559 --> 3267.3590000000004
yeah it's

3267.599 --> 3270.7200000000003
you're gonna lose control the ego is

3269.68 --> 3279.2
gonna

3270.72 --> 3281.1189999999997
yeah take you back

3279.2 --> 3283.4399999999996
because that's what yeah that's how it

3281.119 --> 3283.44
works

3286.16 --> 3291.5989999999997
the ego is also part of you

3289.76 --> 3294.079
so you could even just you know you

3291.599 --> 3296.4
don't have to see your ego as an enemy

3294.079 --> 3297.76
it is just the other side it's the part

3296.4 --> 3301.119
of you

3297.76 --> 3303.8390000000004
there's a much deeper meaning to it to

3301.119 --> 3306.0
things also working that way it needs to

3303.839 --> 3309.44
work that way

3306.0 --> 3312.0
it's essential to the effective

3309.44 --> 3314.079
create the effectivity of creation

3312.0 --> 3317.2
itself

3314.079 --> 3321.8390000000004
it's not no way around it it's

3317.2 --> 3321.839
essential for balance

3341.76 --> 3344.0
right

3344.88 --> 3349.76
because the ego seems to be born of the

3347.599 --> 3352.48
circumstances that surround us the very

3349.76 --> 3354.1600000000003
roots of our environment

3352.48 --> 3357.68
you keep pulling the words out of my

3354.16 --> 3360.24
mouth man stop it

3357.68 --> 3362.3999999999996
so you're out are winning irwin i don't

3360.24 --> 3364.4799999999996
like this no but

3362.4 --> 3366.7200000000003
you're doing great it's exactly the

3364.48 --> 3368.72
point yes the ego

3366.72 --> 3371.04
is the root of the consciousness in the

3368.72 --> 3373.04
very moment it's the response it's what

3371.04 --> 3376.319
next

3373.04 --> 3380.24
based on a preponderance of everything

3376.319 --> 3380.24
from the personal perspective

3389.359 --> 3395.2
a secret our win man this is this is

3392.799 --> 3395.2
that's

3399.28 --> 3403.28
well i am part asian it's just a small

3402.0 --> 3406.079
part

3403.28 --> 3406.079
is so

3411.04 --> 3419.839
but i don't keep it a secret

3431.119 --> 3433.839
yep

3435.119 --> 3438.6400000000003
yeah you're totally right secret asian

3436.88 --> 3440.88
more people should seek for themselves

3438.64 --> 3443.1189999999997
and be creeped out

3440.88 --> 3445.04
problem is though it's like how do you

3443.119 --> 3447.76
handle

3445.04 --> 3448.5589999999997
that going to that point is very tough

3447.76 --> 3450.6400000000003
because

3448.559 --> 3453.28
once you really start to seek once you

3450.64 --> 3456.24
start to ascend in your consciousness

3453.28 --> 3456.7200000000003
you become alone you know for a lot of

3456.24 --> 3459.359
people

3456.72 --> 3461.2799999999997
doing that means stepping away from

3459.359 --> 3463.04
being on the same level

3461.28 --> 3466.559
with a lot of people they hang around

3463.04 --> 3466.5589999999997
with and feel a part of

3467.04 --> 3473.2
i'm not one of those people i have been

3470.319 --> 3474.5589999999997
sort of it's just it was never worth it

3473.2 --> 3478.5589999999997
for me

3474.559 --> 3481.44
because it just doesn't work for me

3478.559 --> 3482.2400000000002
to lower myself like it's too much it's

3481.44 --> 3485.52
not

3482.24 --> 3487.1189999999997
worth the penalty but for a lot of

3485.52 --> 3489.28
people it is

3487.119 --> 3490.1600000000003
because a lot of people have very

3489.28 --> 3493.119
developed

3490.16 --> 3495.359
special social skills like very special

3493.119 --> 3497.76
social skills but intellectually

3495.359 --> 3503.04
they are not so great and for those

3497.76 --> 3506.1600000000003
types of people it's often very tough

3503.04 --> 3508.079
to get into complex information

3506.16 --> 3509.44
although those types of people do have

3508.079 --> 3511.6800000000003
more tendency to

3509.44 --> 3514.839
have a good in-order intuition and

3511.68 --> 3516.8799999999997
cleared up intuition in order to

3514.839 --> 3518.96
distinguish

3516.88 --> 3521.44
and also figure out like when

3518.96 --> 3524.7200000000003
information is too much

3521.44 --> 3527.839
for them instead of completely shooting

3524.72 --> 3531.4399999999996
in themselves in denial

3527.839 --> 3534.64
so yeah different people do different

3531.44 --> 3534.64
things for different reasons

3535.599 --> 3539.3590000000004
and for a lot of people stepping away

3537.76 --> 3542.3190000000004
from the comfort of a

3539.359 --> 3542.319
social herd

3542.48 --> 3548.319
is too much of a sacrifice to get

3545.839 --> 3549.599
really informed about everything and

3548.319 --> 3553.2
then taking a

3549.599 --> 3555.04
stance in that towards the sheeple

3553.2 --> 3558.0789999999997
it's too much of a sacrifice for a lot

3555.04 --> 3560.24
of people so they just don't

3558.079 --> 3562.96
they try to stay away they do listen but

3560.24 --> 3566.319
they don't really

3562.96 --> 3566.319
let it slip in too much

3568.24 --> 3574.0789999999997
squidliness yeah sweetie

3571.359 --> 3574.0789999999997
hey yeah

3580.559 --> 3587.8390000000004
squid form

3595.04 --> 3597.359
hmm

3598.4 --> 3615.839
okay glad you're doing better secret

3599.839 --> 3615.839
agent man

3628.0 --> 3631.599
i don't know youtube just it's a bit of

3631.28 --> 3635.0400000000004
a

3631.599 --> 3637.44
just call them disgusting baller normies

3635.04 --> 3638.079
because they they haven't glanced at

3637.44 --> 3641.599
anything

3638.079 --> 3645.6800000000003
critical they're just as disgusting as

3641.599 --> 3647.28
kids young teens blurting out like

3645.68 --> 3649.2
they're the king of the world like they

3647.28 --> 3652.7200000000003
know everything it's just that

3649.2 --> 3654.64
you know those teens can be like oh

3652.72 --> 3657.2799999999997
super aggravating because they're so

3654.64 --> 3661.68
arrogant but

3657.28 --> 3664.0
that doesn't make them really like that

3661.68 --> 3664.96
unless like after 20 years they're still

3664.0 --> 3668.799
talking like that

3664.96 --> 3672.079
and then they got a real problem but

3668.799 --> 3674.88
yeah baller normies you know when you

3672.079 --> 3676.1600000000003
don't know better then you'll say a lot

3674.88 --> 3682.079
of stupid and very

3676.16 --> 3682.0789999999997
arrogant [ __ ] because it's born out of

3682.839 --> 3687.52
ignorance

3684.16 --> 3687.52
i i don't take it

3687.68 --> 3694.16
as like evil anymore like that

3690.96 --> 3697.04
but it is very aggravating though

3694.16 --> 3698.0789999999997
because it also like perpetuates just

3697.04 --> 3701.119
this bad

3698.079 --> 3704.079
behavioral response like a conditioning

3701.119 --> 3705.04
other people will also do that they

3704.079 --> 3708.48
constantly see

3705.04 --> 3711.599
that type of social response

3708.48 --> 3713.92
structure and that's really annoying

3711.599 --> 3713.92
about it

3716.24 --> 3719.2799999999997
all right anyway i'm gonna round out the
