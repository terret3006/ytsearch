4.64 --> 8.0
and

5.279 --> 9.84
welcome back to the second half of this

8.0 --> 12.4
saturday show

9.84 --> 13.2
my internet got disconnected yeah

12.4 --> 15.040000000000001
they're

13.2 --> 18.64
painting the room downstairs and they

15.04 --> 22.48
accidentally disconnected the internet

18.64 --> 26.4
said reset up

22.48 --> 31.84
the show so hope to see

26.4 --> 31.84
the people from chat get in back

41.28 --> 45.68
put the link in that chat if it's still

44.48 --> 48.48
open

45.68 --> 48.48
no it's closed

53.199 --> 72.32
all right we'll see

59.76 --> 75.28
i'm really in the middle of something

72.32 --> 75.27999999999999
i don't know we'll see

75.36 --> 78.56
who's gonna drop in

82.159 --> 87.84
weather still beautiful out there

114.56 --> 119.52
right so again i had a bit of a

119.84 --> 125.759
stressful morning but i had an

122.32 --> 125.75899999999999
exhilarating evening

125.92 --> 129.36
and all of that i explained in the first

128.959 --> 133.52
part

129.36 --> 135.76000000000002
of the flat earth early bird 818

133.52 --> 135.76000000000002
show

139.2 --> 145.51999999999998
and yeah i got a fresh chat

143.68 --> 147.28
just gonna see who's gonna be part of

145.52 --> 151.36
this

147.28 --> 151.36
this part hopefully talking about

154.84 --> 157.84
subjects

160.319 --> 167.67999999999998
sorry i heard or basically i caught on

164.08 --> 170.959
kind of late caught on that apparently

167.68 --> 174.4
now in the united states like they

170.959 --> 176.959
biden did a new strike on freaking syria

174.4 --> 180.239
again just like that

176.959 --> 180.239
didn't even realize

180.319 --> 185.83999999999997
although that such things are kind of

181.92 --> 185.83999999999997
predictable at this point

189.04 --> 192.319
stirring the bee's nest

197.68 --> 213.84
what is now come on hello george sanford

200.56 --> 213.84
you really want to talk about that again

220.239 --> 225.59900000000002
no but yeah my my landlord's beef is not

223.84 --> 227.84
because of the rental arrangement

225.599 --> 227.84
at all

229.68 --> 237.28
like he even heightened their rent

233.76 --> 240.239
slightly and that is legal

237.28 --> 242.48
recently and i'm just i didn't even

240.239 --> 245.92000000000002
object so

242.48 --> 249.04
no there's li i've done nothing

245.92 --> 249.51899999999998
wrong nothing i got loud a couple of

249.04 --> 253.12
times

249.519 --> 254.239
over the years that's it that's the only

253.12 --> 269.84000000000003
thing

254.239 --> 269.84000000000003
it's got nothing

294.84 --> 297.84
hmm

301.199 --> 307.6
hello miss crazy yet good to see you

305.36 --> 308.40000000000003
this is the second flat earth early bird

307.6 --> 313.52000000000004
show this

308.4 --> 316.23999999999995
day because the first half got cut off

313.52 --> 316.24
the internet

323.84 --> 326.96
all right yesterday i almost forgot that

326.24 --> 331.199
it was

326.96 --> 331.19899999999996
ladies night over at flatter discord

332.72 --> 340.56
and it was that was just funny no not

336.08 --> 340.56
it was interesting and kind of weird

340.72 --> 345.84000000000003
i think a lot of guys were like had like

343.52 --> 347.919
serious mansplaining issues i

345.84 --> 349.039
i love just calling it that it's just so

347.919 --> 352.56
funny

349.039 --> 354.639
because it's like like i had my go

352.56 --> 356.08
i didn't even realize like it was ladies

354.639 --> 357.6
night that that's a thing

356.08 --> 360.71999999999997
maybe some other people got on there

357.6 --> 363.84000000000003
didn't realize it either

360.72 --> 365.6
but like there was like the

363.84 --> 367.28
well there was just a lot of ladies in

365.6 --> 370.639
there and

367.28 --> 372.55999999999995
just gave up this lady vibe it was

370.639 --> 374.319
but they they did stand their ground

372.56 --> 377.36
definitely

374.319 --> 377.36
versus the ballers

378.24 --> 381.84000000000003
so yeah that was kind of special

396.0 --> 409.84
yeah hello welcome back dutch sailor

423.84 --> 430.56
do you have reports oh really

427.12 --> 430.56
what kind of reports are those

431.599 --> 451.84
that's where are you getting that from

435.599 --> 451.84
i've never done that

462.84 --> 467.90999999999997
uh

464.76 --> 467.90999999999997
[Music]

476.4 --> 483.67999999999995
a little gaining wisdom good to see you

481.599 --> 485.44
always everyone is having a good day

483.68 --> 489.28000000000003
well i'm pretty sure that the rest of my

485.44 --> 489.28
day is going to be pretty good probably

490.8 --> 494.319
it just didn't start out all that

504.84 --> 507.84
pleasant

518.839 --> 521.839
hmm

533.68 --> 549.8389999999999
oh man

563.839 --> 569.2
oh so somebody else was talking about me

566.72 --> 576.1600000000001
and there's a song about it well

569.2 --> 577.9200000000001
hahaha very funny

576.16 --> 581.4399999999999
i'm sure there's people out there that

577.92 --> 584.56
are gossiping about me all day long

581.44 --> 584.5600000000001
oh yeah

585.36 --> 588.5600000000001
i don't really care like what are they

587.76 --> 591.8389999999999
gonna do

588.56 --> 591.8389999999999
what are they going to prove

644.839 --> 648.2
eh

647.519 --> 651.309
okay

648.2 --> 651.3090000000001
[Music]

651.68 --> 665.92
seems harmless enough

661.44 --> 665.9200000000001
look at that horizon isn't that amazing

666.8 --> 675.8389999999999
look how flat it is

677.65 --> 680.76
[Music]

686.839 --> 689.839
hmm

714.839 --> 717.839
wow

741.04 --> 746.639
hmm yeah gaining wisdom i have heard of

744.079 --> 746.6389999999999
library

747.12 --> 752.8
but from what i've seen yeah it's kind

750.24 --> 752.8
of slow

755.04 --> 761.04
i haven't really been able to watch any

757.12 --> 773.839
videos on there that were really fluid

761.04 --> 773.8389999999999
so i don't know

781.36 --> 787.519
yeah right george sanford

784.48 --> 789.6800000000001
i agree that that's what i was saying

787.519 --> 793.27
but turtledove had to of course straw

789.68 --> 796.549
man it was a response that we weren't

793.27 --> 796.549
[Music]

798.839 --> 801.839
giving

803.04 --> 806.48
all right nobody's claiming cgi at best

805.76 --> 808.8
it was

806.48 --> 810.5600000000001
slight fisheye lens and the camera was

808.8 --> 813.04
slightly

810.56 --> 814.2399999999999
angled downwards in order to achieve

813.04 --> 816.7199999999999
that effect

814.24 --> 816.72
that's it

823.199 --> 834.56
hello the pie eater

829.68 --> 834.56
am i well sure i'm fine

841.199 --> 846.639
i just i'm a bit uh

844.399 --> 848.399
i call that i got this like this

846.639 --> 850.8
visceral feeling like i'm

848.399 --> 856.48
on the verge of like unfolding a whole

850.8 --> 860.3199999999999
bunch of things

856.48 --> 862.5600000000001
like a a plant that's been

860.32 --> 864.639
sitting through a very long winter

862.56 --> 868.079
waiting to finally

864.639 --> 870.9590000000001
be able to send out the leaves

868.079 --> 872.6389999999999
that's how i'm feeling right now so all

870.959 --> 875.1199999999999
kinds of things about to happen one way

872.639 --> 875.12
or the other

879.12 --> 886.32
what did i have for dinner uh

882.56 --> 889.04
a organic self-made hamburger

886.32 --> 889.0400000000001
beef hamburger

891.199 --> 896.24
with some chili pepper

896.839 --> 903.519
lattice so what

899.44 --> 903.519
yeah um tomato

903.76 --> 908.3199999999999
bunch of mayonnaise ketchup ketchup and

908.8 --> 916.399
hot sauce

913.12 --> 919.839
and that's yeah makes a great hamburger

916.399 --> 922.0
who cooked it i did every step of the

919.839 --> 922.0
way

922.32 --> 927.839
oh yeah onion rings i forgot about that

931.04 --> 936.639
i did eat it a little late though

934.48 --> 940.72
but that's also just because that

936.639 --> 943.44
conversation with my friends

940.72 --> 944.48
on the phone would lasted like three

943.44 --> 947.9200000000001
hours again it

944.48 --> 949.12
usually does and i completely kind of

947.92 --> 951.279
forgot to eat

949.12 --> 952.24
but i still had to eat so i ate

951.279 --> 954.8
eventually like

952.24 --> 956.32
one o'clock at night it's not the best

954.8 --> 958.7199999999999
time to start eating dinner

956.32 --> 960.32
but yeah better late than never was it

958.72 --> 969.839
tasty yes it was

960.32 --> 969.839
very much

980.48 --> 986.16
if two pressures are clearly different

982.959 --> 989.8389999999999
can we call them the same

986.16 --> 993.279
they're both atmo uh well no

989.839 --> 994.8000000000001
the the pressure differential is there

993.279 --> 997.4399999999999
right nobody's denying there's a

994.8 --> 999.5999999999999
pressure gradient

997.44 --> 1001.36
it's just that pressure gradients only

999.6 --> 1003.519
really form

1001.36 --> 1005.12
once the gas has expanded within the

1003.519 --> 1008.72
available volume

1005.12 --> 1012.8
to then as a secondary effect form a

1008.72 --> 1012.8000000000001
gradient within the available volume

1023.6 --> 1029.439
if it was islands proportions of stuff

1026.72 --> 1032.079
inside would be visibly distorted no not

1029.439 --> 1032.0790000000002
necessarily

1037.36 --> 1043.4389999999999
if the camera would be moving

1040.64 --> 1045.1200000000001
within the thing yes then it would

1043.439 --> 1046.0790000000002
definitely be distorting but the camera

1045.12 --> 1052.3999999999999
is not

1046.079 --> 1054.72
rotating within that video it's

1052.4 --> 1055.919
still and then they switch it they don't

1054.72 --> 1058.559
turn it they just

1055.919 --> 1060.24
switch it to the other camera so the

1058.559 --> 1064.3999999999999
camera itself is not moving

1060.24 --> 1067.84
in relation to the the balloon thing

1064.4 --> 1067.8400000000001
that it's in the balloon compartment

1068.08 --> 1071.6
it's a balloon right whatever

1073.919 --> 1078.4
so yeah you can see if it's distorting

1076.08 --> 1078.3999999999999
anything

1078.96 --> 1082.32
except for beyond

1092.84 --> 1095.84
outside

1098.48 --> 1104.72
why are you asking all these questions

1102.32 --> 1104.72
the [ __ ]

1106.799 --> 1111.52
like why are you trying to reverse

1108.799 --> 1113.28
engineer my life

1111.52 --> 1123.84
why are you so interested in that the

1113.28 --> 1123.84
pie eater

1152.24 --> 1157.44
no i think baldy catch i think you kind

1155.2 --> 1159.039
of miscommunicated about that i'm pretty

1157.44 --> 1161.8400000000001
sure flat side knows how

1159.039 --> 1161.84
how things are

1162.24 --> 1166.32
so yeah there is a pressure differential

1164.4 --> 1170.0800000000002
there's different pressures within

1166.32 --> 1173.6
the container it's a gradation

1170.08 --> 1177.52
of pressure but such things only

1173.6 --> 1179.52
happen after the gas has expanded within

1177.52 --> 1183.36
the available volume

1179.52 --> 1183.36
then the it starts to gradiate

1186.32 --> 1193.6
it's going to gradiate in accordance to

1189.52 --> 1198.0
the total volume of the container right

1193.6 --> 1201.6
so that's already yeah

1198.0 --> 1205.76
a problem because of

1201.6 --> 1208.08
what the globe model says

1205.76 --> 1208.96
the volume is it's supposed to be

1208.08 --> 1212.6399999999999
infinite

1208.96 --> 1214.08
it's infinite amount of space so by that

1212.64 --> 1217.1200000000001
standard

1214.08 --> 1218.96
yeah you can demonstrate that you can

1217.12 --> 1220.0
prevent the gas from expanding in all

1218.96 --> 1222.24
directions and

1220.0 --> 1223.84
then instead form some kind of gradient

1222.24 --> 1225.919
that never happens

1223.84 --> 1228.1589999999999
it always expands within the volume

1225.919 --> 1228.159
first

1229.12 --> 1235.84
any test you're gonna do will show this

1260.84 --> 1263.84
god

1271.6 --> 1276.6399999999999
commercial flights to the carmen line

1274.84 --> 1279.28
what really

1276.64 --> 1279.2800000000002
what is that

1280.08 --> 1284.72
i don't know what you're talking about

1281.44 --> 1287.76
emin but it kind of sounds like a

1284.72 --> 1289.84
financial exploit to me you know that

1287.76 --> 1292.08
thing that people are always complaining

1289.84 --> 1294.1589999999999
about how flat earthers do everything

1292.08 --> 1296.24
just for money

1294.159 --> 1298.72
well what you're describing here sounds

1296.24 --> 1303.039
really exactly like that kind of

1298.72 --> 1306.64
openly for the ball

1303.039 --> 1309.36
like is do you want

1306.64 --> 1310.0
religious affirmation of your ball then

1309.36 --> 1311.84
hey

1310.0 --> 1314.88
pay a lot of money and they got

1311.84 --> 1317.84
something that you can do

1314.88 --> 1319.8400000000001
to confirm it to yourself now of course

1317.84 --> 1322.32
the actual confirmation is still going

1319.84 --> 1325.52
to transpire

1322.32 --> 1328.48
within your mentality as in

1325.52 --> 1330.84
how you are going to assimilate the

1328.48 --> 1333.1200000000001
observations that you might be making up

1330.84 --> 1335.4399999999998
there you're still going to throw it

1333.12 --> 1337.6789999999999
through the filters that you're used to

1335.44 --> 1339.3600000000001
throwing information through in order to

1337.679 --> 1343.44
be able to interpret

1339.36 --> 1343.4399999999998
the observations as globe

1344.32 --> 1347.52
but in the meantime they made a lot of

1345.84 --> 1349.4399999999998
money

1347.52 --> 1351.9189999999999
sounds kind of like a financial exploit

1349.44 --> 1351.919
doesn't it

1358.84 --> 1361.84
mn

1383.919 --> 1389.8400000000001
what is that by the way that link

1400.08 --> 1417.84
now it's the same thing 2.0 okay

1428.84 --> 1431.84
hmm

1439.36 --> 1445.84
why were you able to post that that's

1442.84 --> 1445.84
weird

1460.559 --> 1463.84
virgin galactic

1467.52 --> 1474.559
i yeah i think i remember that that's
