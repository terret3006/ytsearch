really

122.32 --> 129.79999999999998
Slim birthday month so anyway right

127.039 --> 133.16
hello Nathan R first in chat good to see

129.8 --> 135.12
you weather today is

133.16 --> 139.2
yeah

135.12 --> 143.28
cloudy it's no Blue Sky in between

139.2 --> 143.28
now it's just overall

147.28 --> 155.8
cloudy a little bit of wind but nothing

151.2 --> 155.79999999999998
nothing nothing with any strength behind

157.72 --> 161.76
it haven't noticed any

162.48 --> 168.56
rain yet we'll see about

165.959 --> 172.159
that but yeah it's

168.56 --> 172.159
not riveting

178.76 --> 181.76
weather

181.959 --> 192.4
yeah it is Friday the 2nd of February

187.4 --> 192.4
2024 the temperature is 8Â°

197.319 --> 204.79899999999998
C look like rain's coming next

201.56 --> 208.959
week we'll

204.799 --> 210.56
see right so yeah I did have a title for

208.959 --> 213.12
today's show

210.56 --> 213.12
play on

213.28 --> 218.28
words came up with it yesterday so it's

215.84 --> 218.28
already

220.2 --> 226.67999999999998
there right but I don't exactly have

223.0 --> 228.879
like not really it's not really a

226.68 --> 233.12
subject I

228.879 --> 233.12
mean it's obviously a

233.68 --> 236.68
joke

238.68 --> 241.68
although

242.079 --> 249.0
yeah I mean human gain of function

245.28 --> 249.0
research to fight pandemic of

249.68 --> 254.92000000000002
uselessness I mean it's a nice

251.959 --> 257.32
multi-layer title I like it that's why I

254.92 --> 261.519
chose it for the title

257.32 --> 263.639
yesterday right cuz yeah we all know

261.519 --> 266.84000000000003
they talk about like all the gain of

263.639 --> 268.6
function researching the medical stuff

266.84 --> 270.919
on supposed

268.6 --> 275.91900000000004
viruses

270.919 --> 275.919
which like technically would have to be

276.16 --> 281.72
nonsense so in when you look at like

279.12 --> 283.919
that those people that do that yeah they

281.72 --> 285.72
might have relatively high paying jobs

283.919 --> 287.79999999999995
but what they're doing is technically

285.72 --> 292.36
completely

287.8 --> 295.96000000000004
useless so maybe the gain of

292.36 --> 297.08000000000004
function is research on supposed viruses

295.96 --> 300.35999999999996
is

297.08 --> 303.039
actually sort of an attempt to

300.36 --> 305.40000000000003
find a gain of function research on

303.039 --> 305.4
those

305.88 --> 312.0
people there's a lot of those types of

308.56 --> 315.72
jobs out there laboratory jobs that do

312.0 --> 320.72
this supposed medical research and a lot

315.72 --> 320.72
of it is actually totally

323.96 --> 330.44
pointless it's researching details about

327.16 --> 331.52000000000004
a a fictional model that doesn't work

330.44 --> 334.919
not even

331.52 --> 337.35999999999996
close and a lot of people spend a lot of

334.919 --> 339.79999999999995
money or get a lot of money spent on

337.36 --> 343.24
them

339.8 --> 346.84000000000003
performing supposed research on

343.24 --> 346.84000000000003
this and it's all

347.44 --> 354.479
nonsense and it it feels like the whole

350.8 --> 357.319
thing is a giant Banker investment just

354.479 --> 360.039
spending billions

357.319 --> 363.40000000000003
just to

360.039 --> 365.36
create this fake impression of no no no

363.4 --> 367.35999999999996
viruses are real because look at all

365.36 --> 369.96000000000004
these people out there researching it

367.36 --> 372.88
all they all this money spent on it it

369.96 --> 376.039
must be real then they spend billions on

372.88 --> 379.08
that right and I think that is really

376.039 --> 382.0
the real reason it's happening it's like

379.08 --> 384.71999999999997
yeah relatively smart people get

382.0 --> 388.12
relatively well-paying jobs to do this

384.72 --> 390.319
nonsense research everywhere in the

388.12 --> 392.199
world why

390.319 --> 393.759
it's not going to amount to anything the

392.199 --> 396.16
only thing that it will amount to is

393.759 --> 399.44
that everybody will believe that it's

396.16 --> 401.96000000000004
actually real because why the hell would

399.44 --> 404.319
all these smart people be working at

401.96 --> 407.63899999999995
this if it wasn't real and all this

404.319 --> 410.24
money would have been paid if it wasn't

407.639 --> 412.36
real it's because they want everybody to

410.24 --> 415.84000000000003
believe it's

412.36 --> 421.44
real it's the seed of the mind that they

415.84 --> 424.11999999999995
use for their supposed pandemic medical

421.44 --> 427.36
control that's why they spent so much

424.12 --> 430.44
money on it it was all a mind control

427.36 --> 434.28000000000003
scheme from the start the whole

430.44 --> 436.52
thing gain of function research it's all

434.28 --> 439.19899999999996
Medical Science Fiction it's all mind

436.52 --> 441.44
control just to make you believe that

439.199 --> 447.44
there is viruses and that they can be

441.44 --> 447.44
dangerous it's all nonsense the whole

448.319 --> 451.319
thing

457.879 --> 461.16
okay Insanity

461.28 --> 464.96
hello that the really

473.52 --> 478.52
you I guess so you used to have a wrench

476.44 --> 481.639
though this is interesting by the way

478.52 --> 481.639
that I can still see see

482.68 --> 487.96
that that you used to have a wrench

485.039 --> 491.759
that's fascinating right so yeah uh did

487.96 --> 491.75899999999996
you guys have a Fallout

493.84 --> 500.31899999999996
yeah he told me that my behavior was

497.44 --> 503.879
losing him money

500.319 --> 505.91900000000004
so I was like okay well why don't you do

503.879 --> 506.84000000000003
it without me then and let's put that to

505.919 --> 511.24
the

506.84 --> 511.23999999999995
test let's see how your money goes

514.159 --> 519.959
now right and if it's going so well for

517.8 --> 521.76
him and he wants me back or whatever or

519.959 --> 525.76
other people want me back then they can

521.76 --> 525.76
donate to my gift send

528.44 --> 535.32
go really wow yeah he literally did that

531.519 --> 539.44
it's on record so what is going back

535.32 --> 542.44
no but it's highly inappropriate and

539.44 --> 542.44
like I'm not taking

549.04 --> 554.079
it and in a way I want to put it to the

556.519 --> 562.6
test I want to

559.279 --> 565.0
see and I want him to know I want him to

562.6 --> 568.12
know that what he

565.0 --> 571.12
said is being

568.12 --> 571.12
tested

572.04 --> 575.1999999999999
and that he'll find

575.399 --> 581.6
out and that once it's found out then

579.04 --> 583.76
yeah then he can say that like yeah I

581.6 --> 586.72
was right since Arwin left I'm doing

583.76 --> 591.399
much better then I'm like hey man good

586.72 --> 594.24
for you I'll just stay on my own turf

591.399 --> 598.12
then cuz my show has been doing much

594.24 --> 600.64
better since I separated like way

598.12 --> 604.24
better

600.64 --> 610.04
I have a standard two to three hour show

604.24 --> 610.04
now I'm much more inspired I'm much more

613.04 --> 617.5999999999999
relaxed and I'm not spending my entire

615.839 --> 622.0400000000001
evening

617.6 --> 624.12
just listening and bickering and yelling

622.04 --> 625.88
and I if if I try to speak up I'll get

624.12 --> 628.5600000000001
yelled against

625.88 --> 629.31
like I don't have that anymore now so

628.56 --> 632.079
I'm fine

629.31 --> 633.8
[Music]

632.079 --> 637.4799999999999
only thing I'm not really all that fine

633.8 --> 639.92
with is the overall lack of support but

637.48 --> 643.72
I mean it's not just like my show it's

639.92 --> 647.7199999999999
like everywhere I think except

643.72 --> 647.72
for really promoted

648.079 --> 652.16
people which obviously I'm

653.2 --> 659.279
not he's a narcissist he won't care well

656.16 --> 661.16
if he won't care then then he won't care

659.279 --> 664.56
like I don't know why you need to like

661.16 --> 664.56
call him a scumbag and all

665.8 --> 674.079
that since when did you have a Fallout

669.2 --> 674.0790000000001
with Nathan I thought that you were all

682.399 --> 686.68
cool and I don't really see the

687.959 --> 690.959
narcissism

699.8 --> 705.24
so I I don't know what you're doing like

701.68 --> 707.12
I this is yeah me splitting off with f

705.24 --> 709.72
doesn't mean like oh this is the place

707.12 --> 712.34
where everybody can now be really angry

709.72 --> 715.489
about Nathan like

712.34 --> 715.489
[Music]

717.8 --> 723.1999999999999
no yeah he TR his shoe caers a while

720.839 --> 726.839
back oh really how you're you're going

723.2 --> 726.839
to have to back that up in my

733.12 --> 738.639
chat what did he do a while back that

736.16 --> 740.36
made you lose all respect for him

738.639 --> 743.8
Insanity

740.36 --> 743.8000000000001
sanity write it

747.88 --> 750.88
down

773.519 --> 777.68
yeah you need to do that you definitely

775.6 --> 779.9200000000001
need to do that since you're literally

777.68 --> 783.92
filling my channel

779.92 --> 786.76
chat my chat here with complaints you

783.92 --> 786.76
you better Back

788.32 --> 792.9590000000001
Him does your everyd boycott include the

791.76 --> 796.399
after

792.959 --> 799.3199999999999
show uh well I might be listening in I'm

796.399 --> 803.32
not really going to pipe up there glammy

799.32 --> 806.1990000000001
the point is is that my position as rwin

803.32 --> 809.1600000000001
in the panel that's over like that's

806.199 --> 810.959
over from from Nathan's side it seems

809.16 --> 813.8
like he's already declared everything

810.959 --> 817.959
that I used to do is now off the table

813.8 --> 817.959
so there's no point in me coming

819.079 --> 827.12
back yeah I my activity has been made

824.24 --> 829.44
illegal on the platform basically by

827.12 --> 832.6
Nathan he declared it so it's like oh

829.44 --> 834.6
yeah well I don't now want to deal with

832.6 --> 837.399
a bunch of yelling panelists that are

834.6 --> 840.36
going to yell at me not to do

837.399 --> 842.48
something yeah if my activity is no

840.36 --> 845.6
longer welcome then why the [Â __Â ] would I

842.48 --> 848.6
even go back and do anything but I like

845.6 --> 848.6
to listen in

850.279 --> 853.279
sometimes

858.68 --> 865.399
right yeah orino W I don't give a [Â __Â ] I

862.519 --> 865.399
literally don't

867.68 --> 873.519
care

869.48 --> 877.24
yeah did did mune also mentioned

873.519 --> 881.0
that that he needs to get the [Â __Â ]

877.24 --> 884.36
out and stopped trying to get me on his

881.0 --> 886.079
show and he kept trying anyway and then

884.36 --> 887.48
eventually I thought like yeah okay you

886.079 --> 890.0
could just be here in the chat and then

887.48 --> 893.9200000000001
he didn't show

890.0 --> 893.92
up yeah I don't really

894.68 --> 901.6389999999999
care like I don't want to associate with

899.12 --> 904.32
those anti flat earthers like oh you're

901.639 --> 906.92
against Nathan Oak oh we're so go [Â __Â ]

904.32 --> 909.9200000000001
yourself you [Â __Â ]

906.92 --> 909.92
degenerates

911.88 --> 918.0
yeah mun and all those others like I

915.48 --> 920.9200000000001
don't now that I'm not connected up with

918.0 --> 923.16
fed anymore I want even less to do with

920.92 --> 927.5999999999999
them

923.16 --> 930.6
yeah they repulse

927.6 --> 930.6
me

931.16 --> 937.24
I don't have my time and energy to waste

933.8 --> 937.24
on those types of

939.72 --> 944.839
people right hey if they like my show

942.24 --> 947.44
and they want to support me that's cool

944.839 --> 950.759
but you're not going to manipulate

947.44 --> 953.1990000000001
me you got it and nobody here in the

950.759 --> 953.1990000000001
chat

957.6 --> 960.6
will

987.519 --> 993.48
ah

990.399 --> 995.48
right so are you going to tell me what

993.48 --> 997.48
what Nathan did that showed his true

995.48 --> 1003.12
colors that made you lose all respect

997.48 --> 1003.12
for him s s or are you just a blabber

1003.279 --> 1007.92
mouth that doesn't actually

1008.16 --> 1013.0
remember yeah because that doesn't work

1017.48 --> 1020.48
here

1047.839 --> 1054.44
okay or are shut up that's that's fine

1050.12 --> 1054.4399999999998
you could just shut up that's

1058.559 --> 1063.3999999999999
cool maybe you need a little gain of

1060.919 --> 1063.4
function

1066.679 --> 1071.0
research because saying that somebody

1069.32 --> 1072.9189999999999
did something that made you lose all

1071.0 --> 1076.44
respect for them and then not actually

1072.919 --> 1080.4
being able to recall what that is that's

1076.44 --> 1080.4
kind of useless isn't it

1083.72 --> 1087.159
better get some gain of function

1096.559 --> 1103.08
research right anyway still got an

1098.84 --> 1106.76
Illuminati croissant standby and

1103.08 --> 1110.72
coffee and I did manage to go to bed not

1106.76 --> 1113.8799999999999
too late finally so I just feel much

1110.72 --> 1113.88
better rested

1123.24 --> 1129.0
H naan can be a bit abrasive no not a

1127.08 --> 1133.559
bit he

1129.0 --> 1133.559
is at times unreasonably

1133.72 --> 1140.32
abrasive but you could also say he just

1137.24 --> 1140.32
being extremely

1141.6 --> 1146.08
offensive sometimes he has trouble

1144.24 --> 1149.4
managing

1146.08 --> 1152.72
it the defensive

1149.4 --> 1155.4
level but I mean it's also because anti

1152.72 --> 1158.6000000000001
flat earthers have just used full on

1155.4 --> 1162.039
psychological warfare level spiritual

1158.6 --> 1164.799
attacks to get to him and when that

1162.039 --> 1166.8799999999999
happens enough eventually you just get

1164.799 --> 1170.32
this Zero

1166.88 --> 1171.7600000000002
Tolerance where any signal of resistance

1170.32 --> 1174.039
even if the person didn't even

1171.76 --> 1177.44
consciously realize it will go make you

1174.039 --> 1180.36
go into that mode I mean Nathan's had

1177.44 --> 1180.3600000000001
that reflex with

1180.48 --> 1185.24
me by

1183.72 --> 1190.0
accident

1185.24 --> 1191.28
so that just happens when Nathan thinks

1190.0 --> 1194.0
that somebody's

1191.28 --> 1197.24
turning

1194.0 --> 1200.24
flipping yeah he does

1197.24 --> 1200.24
that

1201.679 --> 1205.8400000000001
I guarantee you'll never have to do that

1203.96 --> 1210.039
with

1205.84 --> 1212.6399999999999
me cuz I don't vent my complaints really

1210.039 --> 1215.799
on the show anymore I'll just do it

1212.64 --> 1219.0800000000002
online like I did the next

1215.799 --> 1220.44
day or what am I saying I did I started

1219.08 --> 1224.08
up another

1220.44 --> 1224.0800000000002
stream and then did

1227.159 --> 1230.159
that

1249.76 --> 1253.36
wow okay Rich

1257.12 --> 1262.1999999999998
G

1259.76 --> 1265.4
show them more toxic that's interesting

1262.2 --> 1265.4
Richard G that's

1267.4 --> 1272.76
interesting well the the toxic

1270.96 --> 1276.52
attitudes

1272.76 --> 1278.279
do one out of two things either you

1276.52 --> 1279.44
immediately step away because you don't

1278.279 --> 1283.4
want any

1279.44 --> 1286.0
association or you have if you really

1283.4 --> 1288.279
want to know you have to let it go

1286.0 --> 1291.559
through you and basically that does

1288.279 --> 1293.84
things to you it does also open up

1291.559 --> 1297.44
potential gates to Demons I mean people

1293.84 --> 1299.84
go nuts because of it if they're not

1297.44 --> 1299.8400000000001
properly

1301.52 --> 1305.799
shielded but you literally learn to go

1303.96 --> 1309.799
through it and some people end up

1305.799 --> 1316.1589999999999
allergic they're like allergic to

1309.799 --> 1316.1589999999999
it but I mean in a way I have the same

1317.039 --> 1322.64
effect

1318.6 --> 1322.6399999999999
with certain aspects of how I do

1336.159 --> 1341.0
things and with me it's because I'm sick

1339.36 --> 1343.6399999999999
of

1341.0 --> 1347.32
being juggled around by people that

1343.64 --> 1349.64
think they can just like use my overall

1347.32 --> 1352.4399999999998
sensitiveness nature to

1349.64 --> 1355.88
just throw me around like a juggling

1352.44 --> 1355.88
ball like

1376.96 --> 1383.4
no clamy you don't understand my title

1381.159 --> 1385.8400000000001
well then you probably need some gain of

1383.4 --> 1385.8400000000001
function

1406.88 --> 1409.88
research

1417.0 --> 1419.919
okay all

1421.159 --> 1425.0
right trolls are out

1427.76 --> 1432.039
today you didn't realize it at time but

1430.36 --> 1435.32
when you quit drinking you genetically

1432.039 --> 1439.0
altered yourself yeah and so did

1435.32 --> 1443.6789999999999
I man it and you're really well

1439.0 --> 1443.679
genetically it's technically not

1445.279 --> 1449.32
genetically but you change your

1449.88 --> 1455.4
bacteria and it's amazing like how

1452.559 --> 1457.6
integrated bacteria really are and how

1455.4 --> 1460.6000000000001
much that video that you shared with me

1457.6 --> 1463.0
Dr Lanka how much of that actually

1460.6 --> 1464.9599999999998
pointed at it like I already knew like

1463.0 --> 1468.559
yeah bacteria we're with is like in a

1464.96 --> 1471.44
city all my analogies right my

1468.559 --> 1474.6399999999999
descriptions of how I see them but I

1471.44 --> 1478.559
mean like whoa there's basically the

1474.64 --> 1481.64
functions laid out right there in more

1478.559 --> 1484.9189999999999
detail yeah it's astounding sometimes

1481.64 --> 1486.8400000000001
like how I understand things or how I

1484.919 --> 1489.5200000000002
know things without completely

1486.84 --> 1491.399
understanding them but getting it right

1489.52 --> 1494.24
and then later the details like a

1491.399 --> 1497.6
fractal just get rendered they they fill

1494.24 --> 1499.64
in within exactly what I've said and

1497.6 --> 1501.52
then it's like yeah what I said was

1499.64 --> 1505.88
right it just didn't have all the

1501.52 --> 1507.9189999999999
details yet I love

1505.88 --> 1511.24
that it's

1507.919 --> 1515.96
magical because now my foresight was

1511.24 --> 1515.96
real like I did really

1519.12 --> 1522.32
know it's

1523.919 --> 1528.88
amazing the smoking dope daily modifier

1526.88 --> 1532.159
personal person's

1528.88 --> 1532.159
bacteria no

1533.96 --> 1540.96
doubt smoking I mean there's a lot of

1536.64 --> 1545.48
like toxic stuff that do also come with

1540.96 --> 1545.48
smoking that you have bacteria for that

1555.919 --> 1562.8400000000001
certainly you could even argue by the

1558.919 --> 1565.76
way Dr Lanka I think argued for it

1562.84 --> 1567.9599999999998
that when you have this addiction the

1565.76 --> 1570.1589999999999
call if you don't have any you're like I

1567.96 --> 1573.3600000000001
wanted that's actually the bacteria that

1570.159 --> 1577.3200000000002
are calling like

1573.36 --> 1581.279
hey we want to go back to

1577.32 --> 1584.1589999999999
work you do this all the time right we

1581.279 --> 1584.159
want to go back to

1586.6 --> 1589.6
work

1589.799 --> 1594.799
that's amazing

1591.72 --> 1597.559
realization like it is like a democratic

1594.799 --> 1600.0
vote like yeah they are residents now

1597.559 --> 1604.52
you have that all the time uh hey we

1600.0 --> 1604.52
want to do that do that

1616.6 --> 1619.6
now

1626.32 --> 1632.12
it's all fascinating but it's also just

1629.0 --> 1636.84
so elaborate

1632.12 --> 1636.84
just biology is just so

1637.32 --> 1643.8799999999999
much smoking is everything has become

1640.24 --> 1643.88
somewhat expensive Steve

1643.919 --> 1649.5200000000002
Bronson

1646.52 --> 1649.52
hello

1694.799 --> 1701.1589999999999
right I think I'm going

1697.08 --> 1704.519
to put my Illuminati cant in the oven

1701.159 --> 1704.519
smoke a lot of Natural

1704.679 --> 1709.6000000000001
Tobacco well I don't really change

1706.919 --> 1709.6000000000001
smoker or

1711.559 --> 1716.2
anything like I don't like to smoke

1719.96 --> 1725.48
cigarettes I only ever do that when I'm

1722.88 --> 1729.6000000000001
like trying

1725.48 --> 1731.48
to yeah as a response to like wanting to

1729.6 --> 1734.1999999999998
smoke annabis and I don't have any and

1731.48 --> 1739.3990000000001
then I'll smoke

1734.2 --> 1739.3990000000001
that up what low clear

1742.48 --> 1745.88
all right be right

1766.32 --> 1769.32
back

1813.679 --> 1820.6000000000001
and I'm back Hey Brianna

1817.919 --> 1823.48
Johnson have I found an organic tobacco

1820.6 --> 1826.12
brand no there used to be one then they

1823.48 --> 1826.1200000000001
took it all

1826.24 --> 1829.24
away

1848.919 --> 1853.6000000000001
that's that is a bit crazy it is I know

1851.12 --> 1853.6
Ranna

1854.519 --> 1859.24
Johnson but it's what they' have done in

1856.76 --> 1859.24
the Netherland

1859.88 --> 1868.2
so hey steam traveler could you maybe

1863.279 --> 1868.2
we'll start growing it your own

1872.36 --> 1876.84
tobacco or cannabis what do you mean

1880.84 --> 1888.639
Lupo but yeah I mean if I

1883.88 --> 1891.72
had like proper space for growing I

1888.639 --> 1894.4799999999998
definitely do that

1891.72 --> 1899.0
again I just don't have the proper space

1894.48 --> 1899.0
for it so that's why I'm not doing

1899.84 --> 1907.48
it like you can't do all that if you

1904.12 --> 1910.0
just have one room it's just impossible

1907.48 --> 1910.0
and that's

1912.72 --> 1919.159
final oh okay don't smoke tobacco okay

1916.6 --> 1919.1589999999999
that's fine

1924.0 --> 1929.76
I mean I'd love to get my hands on some

1926.76 --> 1933.039
raw tobacco leaves again I had that

1929.76 --> 1936.08
before was great it was just kind of

1933.039 --> 1939.039
expensive to

1936.08 --> 1941.9189999999999
get over the Border basically and it

1939.039 --> 1945.36
took a long time to arrive but I mean it

1941.919 --> 1950.5590000000002
was very pleasant and very good

1945.36 --> 1953.279
quality B and way cheaper

1950.559 --> 1957.84
really it was technically a lot cheaper

1953.279 --> 1957.84
it's just it requires a bit of an

1976.039 --> 1979.039
investment

2005.96 --> 2008.96
m

2018.279 --> 2024.559
I yeah Bri I might be able but I

2020.96 --> 2026.2
mean that would be some Garden

2024.559 --> 2030.08
somewhere

2026.2 --> 2032.559
like you can't like grow cannabis there

2030.08 --> 2035.76
or whatever I mean yeah I might be able

2032.559 --> 2038.399
to grow a few plants yeah well a few

2035.76 --> 2041.8799999999999
plants like for consumption I can

2038.399 --> 2044.279
literally grow on my balcony and I

2041.88 --> 2047.7600000000002
am

2044.279 --> 2050.679
yeah it doesn't work for tobacco or

2047.76 --> 2053.359
cannabis it doesn't work on my balcony

2050.679 --> 2057.52
or in some little garden

2053.359 --> 2057.52
somewhere that's the point it doesn't

2058.839 --> 2066.0789999999997
work cuz I I can't grow it anywhere like

2064.079 --> 2068.8790000000004
they somebody will figure it out

2066.079 --> 2068.8790000000004
probably steal it

2068.919 --> 2073.56
and even if they didn't like where do I

2070.96 --> 2073.56
dry that

2088.72 --> 2094.24
stuff I wanted to do roots from

2091.04 --> 2094.24
vegetable yeah sure it

2095.879 --> 2098.879
is

2099.04 --> 2104.88
temperature and light control to grow

2101.079 --> 2104.88
decent stuff

2105.359 --> 2108.5989999999997
yeah I

2113.44 --> 2120.32
guess yeah so that's that's all out of

2116.44 --> 2123.16
the picture I mean I hope that's kind of

2120.32 --> 2125.8
obvious for me I mean it's cool if you

2123.16 --> 2128.7999999999997
guys did it you

2125.8 --> 2128.8
can

2145.599 --> 2150.44
Community Gardens yeah I think they do

2148.119 --> 2150.44
have

2155.8 --> 2158.8
that

2163.88 --> 2168.319
but are you all suggesting I need to get

2166.119 --> 2168.319
a

2171.0 --> 2176.319
hobby oh yeah yeah no thanks

2176.48 --> 2179.76
thanks I'm

2184.28 --> 2188.7200000000003
good corilla grow yeah yeah

2193.079 --> 2197.8
yeah well if you have enough space

2195.76 --> 2200.1600000000003
everywhere then yeah you could do it or

2197.8 --> 2203.28
if the weather's like really well like a

2200.16 --> 2206.2799999999997
lot of sun then that sort of thing

2203.28 --> 2206.28
becomes

2215.68 --> 2218.68
optional

2219.64 --> 2225.839
yeah that's that's really cool Brianna

2221.96 --> 2229.839
Johnson yeah I can grow plants on

2225.839 --> 2234.16
here yeah on my balcony I recently just

2229.839 --> 2239.56
figured it out it's what I'm doing

2234.16 --> 2239.56
yeah I'm not going to go out there to

2240.04 --> 2246.7599999999998
something go back and forth on a regular

2243.2 --> 2247.56
basis carry stuff there to try to plant

2246.76 --> 2250.0
some

2247.56 --> 2255.88
things

2250.0 --> 2255.88
no is that clear I don't need any hobby

2258.4 --> 2264.88
suggestions and I go

2260.76 --> 2268.2400000000002
outside I am practically outside all day

2264.88 --> 2271.359
long cuz I have my window open for fresh

2268.24 --> 2274.4399999999996
air like and I'm at a high point I get

2271.359 --> 2277.4
fresh air all day long I have to look

2274.44 --> 2278.64
90Â° I see green

2277.4 --> 2281.28
every

2278.64 --> 2282.8799999999997
time I'm

2281.28 --> 2285.5600000000004
okay

2282.88 --> 2288.079
yeah now let's talk about something

2285.56 --> 2291.88
that's actually interesting instead of

2288.079 --> 2294.88
oh please let's get Arwin a hobby I

2291.88 --> 2294.88
don't need a

2305.52 --> 2308.52
hobby

2309.72 --> 2315.68
and that's right Steven Bronson yeah it

2312.52 --> 2317.599
is tougher here I mean it's doable if

2315.68 --> 2319.9199999999996
you had a lot of space and you didn't

2317.599 --> 2323.0
have to worry about people just like

2319.92 --> 2324.2000000000003
walking by like hey hahaa I'm just going

2323.0 --> 2327.04
to ruin

2324.2 --> 2329.96
that or steal

2327.04 --> 2332.56
that yeah I mean what point is it to

2329.96 --> 2337.079
have a garden if you don't have privacy

2332.56 --> 2339.7999999999997
with the garden if you don't have fences

2337.079 --> 2342.4
that only you can have access to cuz

2339.8 --> 2344.2000000000003
other people could just like say oh well

2342.4 --> 2345.96
maybe I don't like that guy because I

2344.2 --> 2348.52
heard he's a flat earther and he just

2345.96 --> 2351.76
[Â __Â ] it up yeah what are you going to

2348.52 --> 2355.56
do nothing nobody's there to stop

2351.76 --> 2355.5600000000004
anything I'm not doing

2365.44 --> 2368.44
it

2390.04 --> 2394.079
blackberries well there's some berries

2392.28 --> 2396.0
that you can definitely grow here in the

2394.079 --> 2398.6400000000003
Netherlands that have absolutely no

2396.0 --> 2402.64
issues with the cold or

2398.64 --> 2404.48
anything my mom in my old house like

2402.64 --> 2407.56
used to have a lot of different berries

2404.48 --> 2412.0
and they grew just fine

2407.56 --> 2412.0
there red white and

2412.48 --> 2417.359
black all

2414.88 --> 2420.359
kinds

2417.359 --> 2420.359
raspberry

2421.64 --> 2429.2
strawberry but yeah we had a pretty

2426.4 --> 2432.6800000000003
substantially sized

2429.2 --> 2438.96
garden with a

2432.68 --> 2441.16
fence and 25 years to work on it yeah

2438.96 --> 2444.44
then it's cool then you actually then it

2441.16 --> 2449.1189999999997
gets to you get something from it yeah

2444.44 --> 2453.2000000000003
yeah none of that is going to happen

2449.119 --> 2454.56
here yeah in my position that's not

2453.2 --> 2458.64
going to

2454.56 --> 2462.599
happen don't imp pose such dreams on me

2458.64 --> 2465.2799999999997
when that is never going to happen yeah

2462.599 --> 2467.1600000000003
I don't want to have dreams dangled in

2465.28 --> 2469.52
front of my face that I know are never

2467.16 --> 2469.52
going to

2485.24 --> 2490.2799999999997
happen huh okay that sounds cool Brandon

2490.52 --> 2496.0
Johnson

2492.079 --> 2496.0
wow a river with

2496.48 --> 2502.359
Salon you don't hear about that as much

2499.96 --> 2505.119
anymore there's no salmon over here I

2502.359 --> 2507.0
can tell you that but there are other

2505.119 --> 2510.6400000000003
there's like

2507.0 --> 2510.64
carps other big

2510.68 --> 2514.72
fish I don't know you might be able to

2513.4 --> 2516.64
eat them

2514.72 --> 2519.0
but they're not going to going to be

2516.64 --> 2519.0
super

2525.88 --> 2531.2000000000003
healthy but I mean I do live right next

2528.839 --> 2533.24
to a river I do see people go fishing

2531.2 --> 2537.7599999999998
there but I mean they're not fishing for

2533.24 --> 2541.68
eating can tell you that it's just hobby

2537.76 --> 2544.3590000000004
fishing mostly I

2541.68 --> 2546.64
think oh yeah forgot about my

2544.359 --> 2549.68
Illuminati going to turn on my coffee

2546.64 --> 2549.68
too be right

2575.16 --> 2578.16
back

2598.4 --> 2603.839
hey

2599.599 --> 2603.839
palp look at how beautiful this one

2605.079 --> 2610.04
is

2607.4 --> 2612.92
sometimes they're all clunky but

2610.04 --> 2615.44
recently been looking really good in

2612.92 --> 2615.44
pyramid

2628.0 --> 2634.92
shape can't stand the taste of I don't

2631.28 --> 2638.2000000000003
eat fish blue pill Evolution tell you

2634.92 --> 2640.52
like I I'd have to be like seriously

2638.2 --> 2642.68
desperate or know like wow this is like

2640.52 --> 2646.119
this pristine

2642.68 --> 2648.9199999999996
area like I'd probably eat an

2646.119 --> 2650.6400000000003
almond of a salmon in the Alps or

2648.92 --> 2653.559
something

2650.64 --> 2658.8799999999997
right and I don't eat fish at all like I

2653.559 --> 2658.88
take fish oil but I can't stand fish any

2659.359 --> 2664.319
fish well I can like I can eat it it's

2662.599 --> 2667.2000000000003
just I really don't like

2664.319 --> 2670.2
it like if it is like octopus or

2667.2 --> 2671.2799999999997
something or squid then I like really

2670.2 --> 2675.72
can't eat

2671.28 --> 2678.6400000000003
it that messes me up that creeps me out

2675.72 --> 2681.0
I'm a lobster and crab

2678.64 --> 2684.92
and

2681.0 --> 2684.92
no seab bugs

2686.48 --> 2693.48
no no not even fried

2689.2 --> 2695.7599999999998
fish but I'll take fish oil though I do

2693.48 --> 2697.04
kind of need it I just I really don't

2695.76 --> 2699.3590000000004
like like

2697.04 --> 2701.16
fish I don't like the taste of it I

2699.359 --> 2703.52
don't like the side taste of it I don't

2701.16 --> 2704.72
like the way it feels in my mouth I like

2703.52 --> 2709.7599999999998
nothing about

2704.72 --> 2709.7599999999998
it except how it feels once it is in

2716.04 --> 2721.64
you and that's why I like fish oil much

2718.8 --> 2724.2000000000003
better CU you don't have to have that

2721.64 --> 2727.8799999999997
taste or the substance you just get the

2724.2 --> 2727.8799999999997
it's in you

2734.04 --> 2741.4
right but it's personal it's a I'm not

2737.16 --> 2744.04
like oh I am against fish eating no do

2741.4 --> 2746.559
not eat the fish only eat the oil like

2744.04 --> 2749.44
no it's just I don't like it me

2746.559 --> 2752.52
personally Arwin the person the body

2749.44 --> 2754.2400000000002
arguably even it's nothing spiritual

2752.52 --> 2756.24
it's just just something I don't like I

2754.24 --> 2758.7599999999998
had weird experiences with it when I was

2756.24 --> 2762.1189999999997
young that made me just really not like

2758.76 --> 2765.2000000000003
it like I've seen my parents get really

2762.119 --> 2767.88
really sick from eating shellfish and

2765.2 --> 2771.48
and [Â __Â ] I think that probably

2767.88 --> 2775.319
contributed to me like yeah how about I

2771.48 --> 2775.319
just go for a bit of chicken and

2776.04 --> 2781.16
fries and like but they kept doing it

2779.2 --> 2784.52
though and I'm

2781.16 --> 2787.1189999999997
like you must really like that stuff

2784.52 --> 2788.2
because I don't understand why you're

2787.119 --> 2791.48
doing

2788.2 --> 2795.4399999999996
that like there was this divide between

2791.48 --> 2795.44
me and my parents when it came to

2797.079 --> 2802.7200000000003
food and I guess that at home we didn't

2799.76 --> 2805.3590000000004
eat any fish or shellfish because of me

2802.72 --> 2808.839
but then when we went on holiday to

2805.359 --> 2810.96
Spain for a month then in restaurant

2808.839 --> 2812.72
they would always eat fish and shellfish

2810.96 --> 2815.96
and all that stuff all over the place

2812.72 --> 2819.2
and I'd be like oh God but they would

2815.96 --> 2822.28
get sick from it too and it's just extra

2819.2 --> 2824.8799999999997
like I don't get you why do you do this

2822.28 --> 2824.88
it's so

2831.92 --> 2839.28
gross hello

2834.839 --> 2841.7999999999997
Clarence you should come UK no

2839.28 --> 2844.4
definitely don't respond to people that

2841.8 --> 2847.7200000000003
say you should come

2844.4 --> 2847.7200000000003
UK yeah

2850.2 --> 2856.2
no and I don't need some fish and chips

2853.2 --> 2856.2
either

2857.76 --> 2861.88
thanks I'll take the chips

2863.0 --> 2868.8
though you got chck from a chicken

2866.119 --> 2871.839
egg wow that must have been one messed

2868.8 --> 2871.8390000000004
up chicken egg

2874.72 --> 2878.72
Palpatine

2876.599 --> 2880.8
that's like a really bad did like did

2878.72 --> 2882.839
you get it raw or something like if you

2880.8 --> 2885.119
get a really bad

2882.839 --> 2886.839
egg and you're stupid enough to like

2885.119 --> 2889.839
make mayonnaise with it or something

2886.839 --> 2893.0
yeah that'll [Â __Â ] you up but I mean even

2889.839 --> 2895.119
if it's an egg is half rotten but if

2893.0 --> 2897.4
it's not stinking yet rotten but if it's

2895.119 --> 2899.88
like very old and you bake it there's no

2897.4 --> 2902.48
going to be no issue so it would have to

2899.88 --> 2905.2000000000003
had been raw raw or something otherwise

2902.48 --> 2907.64
you can't get that sick from an egg

2905.2 --> 2907.64
never SE

2928.079 --> 2934.599
it but not all the way through

2931.88 --> 2936.2400000000002
oh yuck

2934.599 --> 2937.559
yeah

2936.24 --> 2939.4399999999996
yeah that's the problem yeah but that's

2937.559 --> 2942.559
the problem when you go cook it yeah if

2939.44 --> 2946.0
you bake it you never have that problem

2942.559 --> 2949.079
ever it never will

2946.0 --> 2951.559
happen you immediately break it open you

2949.079 --> 2955.079
immediately get the smell or look at how

2951.559 --> 2957.8390000000004
old it is if you don't know that and you

2955.079 --> 2960.28
cook it then yeah you might run some

2957.839 --> 2964.319
risk like you don't know what's now you

2960.28 --> 2964.3190000000004
can't look through it when it's

2964.52 --> 2967.52
cooked

2968.48 --> 2974.599
anyway I'll stop bothering you about it

2972.28 --> 2978.4
I never got sick from an

2974.599 --> 2981.28
egg I never even got like sick from

2978.4 --> 2983.559
chicken but I do like my chicken like

2981.28 --> 2986.6800000000003
weird really well done I overall like my

2983.559 --> 2989.2400000000002
meat really well done I'm not like a raw

2986.68 --> 2993.0789999999997
guy that's like oh just take the burger

2989.24 --> 2998.2
one time just is a little bit oh look at

2993.079 --> 3000.76
how raw and isn't no I I like my meat

2998.2 --> 3000.7599999999998
kind of well

3002.319 --> 3007.16
done but I try not to overdo it

3007.559 --> 3014.6800000000003
though because if it's all hard

3010.839 --> 3019.119
and that's not good then like the fats

3014.68 --> 3019.1189999999997
are basically lost you do

3019.52 --> 3027.44
that but like I don't get salmonella or

3023.64 --> 3027.44
anything from that

3029.64 --> 3034.48
like I won't get that here and I

3032.4 --> 3036.119
sometimes I eat my chicken that's over

3034.48 --> 3038.04
the date or

3036.119 --> 3041.48
whatever or

3038.04 --> 3043.92
even beef meat and it yeah becomes kind

3041.48 --> 3046.76
of stinky and it looks like oh it's kind

3043.92 --> 3048.7200000000003
of grayish that's not good not when it's

3046.76 --> 3050.7200000000003
super gray that's like [Â __Â ] up then

3048.72 --> 3052.9599999999996
you have to really throw it away but

3050.72 --> 3057.7599999999998
like it's not pleasant but I mean if I

3052.96 --> 3059.799
just do it right it's very doable and

3057.76 --> 3062.8390000000004
you can eat it and you won't become sick

3059.799 --> 3066.04
you'll feel something like oh there's a

3062.839 --> 3068.48
there's like a a slightly bit of toxin

3066.04 --> 3072.2799999999997
that came along with it but my body can

3068.48 --> 3075.319
proc it easily very easily as long as

3072.28 --> 3078.28
you like keep on eating more and more of

3075.319 --> 3078.2799999999997
that

3080.0 --> 3087.359
right and so I don't get sick with

3083.4 --> 3087.359
salmonella or anything I just don't

3102.2 --> 3106.1189999999997
oo yeah that's nice see can star

3108.2 --> 3114.9199999999996
watero yeah that is pretty amazing I

3111.559 --> 3117.52
mean I if You' catch that and I was

3114.92 --> 3121.359
there I I'd probably take a bite out of

3117.52 --> 3124.839
that just to like notice like do I feel

3121.359 --> 3124.839
this objection with this

3125.4 --> 3131.1600000000003
too cuz I've never had that anything

3129.0 --> 3135.68
like real fresh fish from the river or

3131.16 --> 3138.0789999999997
anything I've had fish from the sea that

3135.68 --> 3141.68
I shot well I didn't really have it my

3138.079 --> 3141.6800000000003
parents had it they said it was

3144.28 --> 3149.1600000000003
good

3146.52 --> 3149.16
I just didn't want

3149.559 --> 3155.0400000000004
to all right anyway I'm going to get my

3151.88 --> 3155.04
coffee I'll be right

3174.24 --> 3177.24
back

3219.4 --> 3224.04
oh my coffee bacteria are in high

3234.16 --> 3237.16
anticipation

3238.319 --> 3242.119
take few Easter eggs

3255.52 --> 3261.16
wet all right but I mean look

3258.96 --> 3263.52
guys when I talked about oh you could

3261.16 --> 3265.68
get salmonella from a raw egg yeah if

3263.52 --> 3269.079
it's like a really old egg

3265.68 --> 3271.3999999999996
egg or the chicken was like having an

3269.079 --> 3274.96
off day or

3271.4 --> 3277.559
whatever like really bad but in general

3274.96 --> 3280.839
like you can eat raw

3277.559 --> 3283.2000000000003
eggs they call it schoning

3280.839 --> 3285.4
apparently it's like something that

3283.2 --> 3286.7599999999998
people that really like try to do

3285.4 --> 3291.64
bodybuilding

3286.76 --> 3294.28
or Athletics do but I mean you got to

3291.64 --> 3296.44
like do it fresh you got to like om

3294.28 --> 3300.3190000000004
Benjamin did it on camera you would pick

3296.44 --> 3304.76
like an egg late that day and

3300.319 --> 3304.7599999999998
just broke it open and swallowed

3304.799 --> 3309.48
it you can do that but you have to do it

3308.24 --> 3315.0789999999997
really

3309.48 --> 3315.079
fresh so you don't get sick from that at

3324.0 --> 3327.76
all

3325.68 --> 3330.799
I'm not really in favor of that by the

3327.76 --> 3332.88
way like I don't I don't think I've ever

3330.799 --> 3337.48
done

3332.88 --> 3337.48
it and the idea kind of grosses me

3341.359 --> 3349.0389999999998
out like I eat pretty good quality

3344.76 --> 3351.079
organic eggs but like I wouldn't slunk

3349.039 --> 3354.5200000000004
them cuz it's

3351.079 --> 3355.6800000000003
like they'd have to be even fresher for

3354.52 --> 3358.68
me to

3355.68 --> 3361.16
to try that out like I I'd want them I'd

3358.68 --> 3364.3999999999996
go get them at the farmer like can I

3361.16 --> 3368.44
have one of these eggs that was from

3364.4 --> 3368.44
today and then I might try

3380.76 --> 3385.92
it body can go with a lot of

3383.92 --> 3388.96
bacteria

3385.92 --> 3391.2400000000002
wasn't having it that day yeah well it

3388.96 --> 3393.92
can only cope with it if it is in a good

3391.24 --> 3398.1189999999997
condition like if you slap properly for

3393.92 --> 3403.2400000000002
example right not sleeping properly it

3398.119 --> 3403.2400000000002
can be really bad on your overall

3404.72 --> 3409.5989999999997
metabolism and then you won't be able to

3407.44 --> 3412.039
take something that normally if you felt

3409.599 --> 3413.76
really well rested and strong you you

3412.039 --> 3418.44
take it no

3413.76 --> 3422.0
problem like like when I don't feel well

3418.44 --> 3425.039
rested coffee can be a very serious

3422.0 --> 3427.72
problem for me like it will make me like

3425.039 --> 3432.119
actually feel sick like I could get a

3427.72 --> 3432.1189999999997
panic attack any second it's not

3433.599 --> 3439.6800000000003
good so even yesterday getting the

3436.28 --> 3441.92
coffee was like slightly a risk because

3439.68 --> 3445.839
I had not slept all that great but then

3441.92 --> 3448.48
eventually I felt more rested and

3445.839 --> 3448.48
and it went

3456.799 --> 3459.799
fine

3463.359 --> 3468.0789999999997
H the raw eggs are not permitted in the

3469.039 --> 3473.44
temple I guess you're not a bodybuilder

3473.799 --> 3476.799
Tommy

3481.64 --> 3487.24
right I'm going to take a bite of my

3482.96 --> 3487.2400000000002
Illuminati cam for it's cold again

3503.72 --> 3506.72
cheers

3833.279 --> 3836.279
here

3864.079 --> 3866.599
what what's in

3867.52 --> 3871.2
that vegetable

3892.799 --> 3896.16
stuff what

3899.279 --> 3906.48
any food or drink wise that I've not had

3903.079 --> 3910.119
no Absolut I know I don't give a

3906.48 --> 3910.119
[Â __Â ] absolutely

3910.44 --> 3917.359
not no I've already made up my mind I'll

3913.799 --> 3917.359
be very content to

3917.52 --> 3924.68
like eat diet that are simp that are

3921.92 --> 3928.039
like similar to what my grandmother

3924.68 --> 3928.0389999999998
did like very

3929.279 --> 3934.359
simple a lot of potatoes probably some

3935.0 --> 3940.799
beats things like that and i' be very

3938.599 --> 3941.52
happy if I can still get like a sausage

3940.799 --> 3944.559
or

3941.52 --> 3948.48
something I mean my grandma didn't get

3944.559 --> 3948.48
those and she still made it

3950.119 --> 3958.2000000000003
through I think that we can still get it

3954.279 --> 3959.76
I think that the whole like oh destroy

3958.2 --> 3962.52
everything I

3959.76 --> 3964.119
mean the meats only really going to

3962.52 --> 3968.24
disappear

3964.119 --> 3971.319
here if these [Â __Â ] politicians win

3968.24 --> 3974.52
and like arrest all the

3971.319 --> 3979.44
farmers like yeah then the meat is

3974.52 --> 3979.44
really going to disappear then

3980.119 --> 3987.799
okay but I don't think it's really

3983.559 --> 3987.799
happening yet just

3989.76 --> 3994.5200000000004
yet I mean there's going to have to be

3992.24 --> 3997.7599999999998
like something that was going to be very

3994.52 --> 4002.24
close to a civil war before that could

3997.76 --> 4002.2400000000002
ever happen like that

4002.64 --> 4009.0389999999998
here and the farmers are out there and

4005.64 --> 4009.0389999999998
they're kicking

4012.76 --> 4020.6400000000003
ass yeah just kind of a generic video

4017.279 --> 4023.0
but if you want to see some

4020.64 --> 4027.92
examples from

4023.0 --> 4027.92
recent times like this all pretty

4028.96 --> 4032.76
recent in the last few

4037.4 --> 4043.64
years farmers in France yeah yeah those

4041.2 --> 4046.3999999999996
they're so those farmers in France are

4043.64 --> 4046.4
just like

4048.599 --> 4054.6400000000003
they well they're

4051.079 --> 4057.96
notorious for how far they take it which

4054.64 --> 4059.8799999999997
is the only way to go really I mean one

4057.96 --> 4063.2
step away from just freaking shooting

4059.88 --> 4065.6400000000003
your opponents

4063.2 --> 4068.359
basically they take it as far as they

4065.64 --> 4070.96
can and it's the only way to

4068.359 --> 4075.52
go like other farmers are going to be

4070.96 --> 4077.76
more like that too because of all this

4075.52 --> 4082.599
right but it's not just France it's also

4077.76 --> 4085.1600000000003
Belgium and Germany a lot in Germany the

4082.599 --> 4085.1600000000003
Netherlands

4085.24 --> 4091.64
some and they're all networking like

4088.039 --> 4094.4
they're all T like the farmers are

4091.64 --> 4099.799
starting to really form a

4094.4 --> 4099.799
guild which is great like I like

4100.44 --> 4106.3189999999995
that I mean as far as I'm concerned they

4103.159 --> 4108.2789999999995
are kind of like a nobility class like

4106.319 --> 4110.64
the actual ones like the ones that

4108.279 --> 4113.2390000000005
really do everything and hold it all

4110.64 --> 4115.319
together yeah not the [Â __Â ]

4113.239 --> 4117.08
politicians the politicians are the

4115.319 --> 4119.52
parah

4117.08 --> 4121.64
class that just play on our weaknesses

4119.52 --> 4124.759
to try to mind control us into giving

4121.64 --> 4126.319
them all our power the farmers are the

4124.759 --> 4128.44
are the ones that are actually the

4126.319 --> 4131.52
nobility that are keeping everybody

4128.44 --> 4135.12
alive including these [Â __Â ]

4131.52 --> 4137.040000000001
politicians yeah that's how I see it and

4135.12 --> 4138.04
if they're finally becoming more aware

4137.04 --> 4140.679
of

4138.04 --> 4142.64
that like people in general should be

4140.679 --> 4144.719
more aware of that but especially the

4142.64 --> 4146.759
farmers themselves should be very well

4144.719 --> 4149.04
aware of that

4146.759 --> 4150.319
like you're actually in a way the

4149.04 --> 4154.6
nobility

4150.319 --> 4157.759
and the New World Order the globalism is

4154.6 --> 4161.0
coming for your class they're trying to

4157.759 --> 4164.52
eradicate you as the class and if that

4161.0 --> 4168.679
happens there will be Untold death death

4164.52 --> 4171.4800000000005
and famine around the world Untold

4168.679 --> 4175.08
like it'll make medieval times look like

4171.48 --> 4175.08
a a freaking

4176.52 --> 4183.759
joke like a paradise in comparison that

4181.4 --> 4183.759
if that

4184.0 --> 4189.52
happens it'll make soil in green look

4187.56 --> 4192.719
like a vacation

4189.52 --> 4194.88
video in comparison

4192.719 --> 4196.6
yeah

4194.88 --> 4199.96
so if they're gilding

4196.6 --> 4199.96
up that's

4201.84 --> 4209.400000000001
great and if they go to war I'm almost

4204.8 --> 4212.0
like how do we help is there anything

4209.4 --> 4216.08
non Farmers could

4212.0 --> 4218.48
do to help the farmers in the Civil War

4216.08 --> 4220.5599999999995
like yeah we're siding with the farmers

4218.48 --> 4222.718999999999
and not the [Â __Â ] politicians if the

4220.56 --> 4225.8
politicians and their [Â __Â ] buildings

4222.719 --> 4228.84
and everything just burn down everybody

4225.8 --> 4232.4400000000005
can Rejoice yeah if the farmers and the

4228.84 --> 4237.76
Farms burn down then everybody

4232.44 --> 4237.759999999999
dies so I know which side I

4237.8 --> 4244.28
pick

4240.56 --> 4248.080000000001
right and it's still like just because

4244.28 --> 4250.639999999999
these corrupted poit political guilds

4248.08 --> 4252.64
and their conspiracies networks and

4250.64 --> 4255.64
their bankers and everything their

4252.64 --> 4255.64
connection

4256.0 --> 4262.159
defeating them doesn't mean oh now let's

4258.8 --> 4263.84
get rid of government now it means Purge

4262.159 --> 4266.679
this

4263.84 --> 4269.400000000001
government it's the people in them that

4266.679 --> 4272.6
are [Â __Â ] it

4269.4 --> 4274.96
up it's not the government system itself

4272.6 --> 4278.159000000001
the government system is

4274.96 --> 4280.32
great it's very complicated elaborate

4278.159 --> 4283.04
and and functional in a way it's just

4280.32 --> 4285.36
become completely occupied by evil

4283.04 --> 4289.4
people that are

4285.36 --> 4291.679
obsessed with trying to abuse it just to

4289.4 --> 4293.92
stay in power and like always finding a

4291.679 --> 4297.719
way to just stay there like a cancer

4293.92 --> 4300.6
that just won't get out right but even

4297.719 --> 4303.04
then the government is still

4300.6 --> 4306.2390000000005
miraculously

4303.04 --> 4308.0
functional even with these

4306.239 --> 4311.638999999999
self-destructive

4308.0 --> 4314.8
freaks taking up seat

4311.639 --> 4316.639
there so yeah government definitely it

4314.8 --> 4320.56
like the people in it should be

4316.639 --> 4323.0
replaced government itself doing just is

4320.56 --> 4327.4400000000005
fine I mean there always it's a work in

4323.0 --> 4327.44
progress always and it should keep doing

4327.92 --> 4332.08
that but I mean the first priority now

4330.48 --> 4336.199
is just to like get these people

4332.08 --> 4338.96
replaced entirely and then go after them

4336.199 --> 4341.4
like have it established like how is

4338.96 --> 4344.36
this conspiracy this anti-national

4341.4 --> 4347.0
conspiracy organized

4344.36 --> 4350.799999999999
like what money powers are making this

4347.0 --> 4352.56
possible yeah they should like get their

4350.8 --> 4356.88
asses handed to

4352.56 --> 4356.88
them like politically

4357.6 --> 4363.320000000001
financially like to the level of like

4360.56 --> 4365.56
house arrest deep

4363.32 --> 4368.84
investigation into

4365.56 --> 4372.679
conspiracy and then potential jail

4368.84 --> 4377.04
time like I think it would be great if

4372.679 --> 4381.1990000000005
like all the the [Â __Â ] Bankers all

4377.04 --> 4383.199
got like let's process all the bankers

4381.199 --> 4385.678999999999
let's see what they've actually been up

4383.199 --> 4388.96
to like no more hiding anything like it

4385.679 --> 4391.6
will all be revealed and then we can see

4388.96 --> 4393.4
which Bankers are allowed to actually

4391.6 --> 4395.76
Bank

4393.4 --> 4398.48
afterward and those that are really

4395.76 --> 4400.88
turning out to be criminally corrupted

4398.48 --> 4404.5199999999995
they should all go to jail and literally

4400.88 --> 4408.0
have all their wealth confiscated

4404.52 --> 4410.92
all of it like you don't get it then you

4408.0 --> 4413.679
don't get your wealth then yeah you're a

4410.92 --> 4416.639
[Â __Â ] demon that only wants to destroy

4413.679 --> 4420.32
everybody with your money well then you

4416.639 --> 4422.08
don't get to have that money then at

4420.32 --> 4426.44
all

4422.08 --> 4429.12
just buy then if you only wish to use

4426.44 --> 4431.759999999999
your money for destruction of humanity

4429.12 --> 4435.36
then you don't get the money it's taken

4431.76 --> 4435.360000000001
from you then

4436.56 --> 4442.76
yeah somebody else will do a more

4439.8 --> 4445.04
constructive job with those resources

4442.76 --> 4445.04
than

4447.159 --> 4454.36
you I think if we literally

4451.159 --> 4456.04
like have a revolution against the

4454.36 --> 4459.08
bankers

4456.04 --> 4460.48
more than against the government system

4459.08 --> 4461.92
I mean those people in the government

4460.48 --> 4464.879999999999
they're all corrupted they should get

4461.92 --> 4468.4
out but the real Revolution should be

4464.88 --> 4468.400000000001
against the entire banking

4471.36 --> 4475.36
system and what what they've

4479.28 --> 4482.639
done like

4482.719 --> 4487.2390000000005
anti-nationalist

4484.239 --> 4487.239
discriminatory

4488.52 --> 4495.280000000001
banking it should be full like illegal

4491.52 --> 4495.280000000001
it should be illegal

4495.52 --> 4502.040000000001
but it's really yeah it it all depends

4498.88 --> 4505.28
you know like once this this freaking

4502.04 --> 4508.159
Dem missionary government that's just WF

4505.28 --> 4511.199
corrupt as

4508.159 --> 4514.5199999999995
hell if that really stops then

4511.199 --> 4514.5199999999995
everything else can

4515.92 --> 4520.04
adapt you know in the Netherlands you

4518.159 --> 4523.799999999999
never really know whether like

4520.04 --> 4526.5199999999995
everybody's just corrupt with the

4523.8 --> 4528.639
government or if it's just this Dutch

4526.52 --> 4531.320000000001
thing it's like oh well if we're taken

4528.639 --> 4533.679
by the enemy I still have to stay afloat

4531.32 --> 4535.96
so I'll just fully [Â __Â ] to

4533.679 --> 4537.6
them I'll just play along with their

4535.96 --> 4540.08
game and just even though everybody

4537.6 --> 4542.4400000000005
hates it and then as soon as they're

4540.08 --> 4545.96
gone like oh oh quickly turn it around

4542.44 --> 4547.32
yeah I'm actually a pro nationalist like

4545.96 --> 4550.159
they could just do that they could just

4547.32 --> 4553.239
flip it around because that is kind of a

4550.159 --> 4557.679
Dutch thing almost like in business and

4553.239 --> 4557.678999999999
Banking and it all very

4558.52 --> 4564.639
grably but there's a good chance like if

4560.92 --> 4568.4400000000005
you get these corrupted systems these

4564.639 --> 4570.6
people corrupted system people in the

4568.44 --> 4573.44
government out of

4570.6 --> 4575.360000000001
there and basically reorganize all the

4573.44 --> 4577.799999999999
priorities and everything then it could

4575.36 --> 4580.48
be that all these banks are just either

4577.8 --> 4584.52
going to run away like literally flee on

4580.48 --> 4586.44
an airplane away to swiland or whatever

4584.52 --> 4589.320000000001
going and hiding

4586.44 --> 4591.36
there or they'll just like oh yeah no we

4589.32 --> 4594.239
were just playing along just to stay in

4591.36 --> 4596.44
business and so [Â __Â ] all that like we're

4594.239 --> 4598.718999999999
pro nationalists we're pro farmers and

4596.44 --> 4602.678999999999
we want secure bars

4598.719 --> 4604.12
and and like yeah [Â __Â ] woke they could

4602.679 --> 4606.6
do do it just like that they could just

4604.12 --> 4609.84
say like [Â __Â ] woke like yeah okay those

4606.6 --> 4613.159000000001
prior yeah yeah no you get ads with

4609.84 --> 4614.4800000000005
white people now hey how about that and

4613.159 --> 4617.199
everybody's

4614.48 --> 4620.199
rejoicing and all the sjws are all

4617.199 --> 4620.199
squirting and

4622.4 --> 4625.5199999999995
crying they could just switch it just

4624.6 --> 4627.88
like

4625.52 --> 4629.92
that and if they wouldn't be able to

4627.88 --> 4633.2390000000005
then they'd probably

4629.92 --> 4633.2390000000005
flee but I

4633.76 --> 4638.12
mean how do we get that

4638.639 --> 4645.2390000000005
switch when there's still like parties

4643.12 --> 4647.04
even in power that are supposedly

4645.239 --> 4649.799999999999
opposition to the cartel are like

4647.04 --> 4652.4
blatantly corrupted to the cartel

4649.8 --> 4655.92
they're the nuts of obvious

4652.4 --> 4658.0
establishment BBB party is blatantly

4655.92 --> 4660.6
revealed to be a controlled opposition

4658.0 --> 4664.88
not so obvious establishment

4660.6 --> 4667.56
pvv who won the election here is turning

4664.88 --> 4671.32
out to be a not so obvious establishment

4667.56 --> 4674.360000000001
and I already had strong suspicion like

4671.32 --> 4678.199
uh votes from other parties were just

4674.36 --> 4681.92
completely blatantly stolen and given to

4678.199 --> 4684.48
that party like the votes people filmed

4681.92 --> 4687.0
themselves voting and like the votes

4684.48 --> 4692.199
didn't show up like it's

4687.0 --> 4693.4
been rigged rigged rigged like like like

4692.199 --> 4696.48
in in the

4693.4 --> 4699.96
US almost to that level I mean there's

4696.48 --> 4702.599999999999
not like giant ballots showing up and

4699.96 --> 4705.92
being dumped at sights on camera not

4702.6 --> 4708.2390000000005
like that but I mean you can just do the

4705.92 --> 4710.04
math and notice like yeah these

4708.239 --> 4713.718999999999
elections were just [Â __Â ]

4710.04 --> 4716.28
riged people have actual proof that it

4713.719 --> 4718.199
was rigged like they made a vote on an

4716.28 --> 4720.8
unusual party

4718.199 --> 4724.0
member and then they look afterward it

4720.8 --> 4727.28
didn't show up because every vote that

4724.0 --> 4729.8
has been done should like it's

4727.28 --> 4731.48
registered and then there's a print

4729.8 --> 4734.12
afterward you get to see how many votes

4731.48 --> 4739.28
everybody got and those folks would just

4734.12 --> 4742.04
not show up so it is provably riged the

4739.28 --> 4746.639
elections here recently have been

4742.04 --> 4750.76
provably rigged in favor of this pvv

4746.639 --> 4752.96
party with the left left think oh my god

4750.76 --> 4755.92
there are opponents they are literally

4752.96 --> 4758.52
your own controlled opposition and they

4755.92 --> 4758.52
work

4761.48 --> 4766.879999999999
together it's just

4763.36 --> 4770.0
that party is pretending like they're

4766.88 --> 4772.92
opposing but they work together they do

4770.0 --> 4777.28
everything like they only vote

4772.92 --> 4779.8
against the left the opponent the cartel

4777.28 --> 4782.32
if they know it's not going to make a

4779.8 --> 4783.96
difference if it would actually make a

4782.32 --> 4786.799999999999
difference in some vote they'll vote

4783.96 --> 4789.2390000000005
with them for no logical reason other

4786.8 --> 4791.84
there then to be a controlled

4789.239 --> 4794.839999999999
opposition that's what they

4791.84 --> 4794.84
are

4811.719 --> 4816.56
yeah the election system here is

4814.48 --> 4819.04
Thoroughly corrupted and the people that

4816.56 --> 4822.159000000001
count the votes are thoroughly corrupted

4819.04 --> 4824.28
they're all like the Democrats in the US

4822.159 --> 4827.199
like

4824.28 --> 4830.04
they think that they have the right to

4827.199 --> 4833.4
just delete people's voice voices or

4830.04 --> 4837.0
votes because they are deemed wrong

4833.4 --> 4839.12
votes or voices and that's the people

4837.0 --> 4840.84
that have counted the votes during the

4839.12 --> 4843.88
election

4840.84 --> 4846.84
here like these are not people that

4843.88 --> 4850.36
aren't political these are people that

4846.84 --> 4852.719
are registered with the cartel party and

4850.36 --> 4856.48
they're just oh no we're just trusted we

4852.719 --> 4856.4800000000005
we're just trusted because we say

4861.239 --> 4868.32
so it's really corrupted here it's

4865.239 --> 4872.28
bad you thought the US was bad well in

4868.32 --> 4872.28
the Netherlands it's really bad

4877.36 --> 4880.759999999999
too all right

4881.639 --> 4884.639
anyway

4886.28 --> 4890.5199999999995
does the Netherlands have the world's

4887.92 --> 4892.1990000000005
most corrupt government in the

4890.52 --> 4893.8
world

4892.199 --> 4897.159
yeah

4893.8 --> 4899.6
probably but I mean the corruption is so

4897.159 --> 4902.0
deep that like at some point the

4899.6 --> 4905.56
corruption is so deep like you can't

4902.0 --> 4909.32
tell anymore how bad it really is it's

4905.56 --> 4911.639
so corrupt you can't even tell anymore

4909.32 --> 4913.92
How deep the corruption really

4911.639 --> 4916.679
goes

4913.92 --> 4921.56
we just know it's farther than any of us

4916.679 --> 4921.56
can handle like these people are

4922.76 --> 4929.88
like like Satan like as far as you can

4930.6 --> 4937.159000000001
get

4932.32 --> 4941.12
satanic ruthless Psychopathic like

4937.159 --> 4941.12
absolutely relentlessly

4941.56 --> 4944.56
psychopathic

4945.639 --> 4949.36
it seems like these people are so

4947.4 --> 4951.719
satanic in the government that only

4949.36 --> 4956.12
thing they care about is breaking our

4951.719 --> 4958.36
will like that's a singular Obsession

4956.12 --> 4960.36
that all of them have it's like it

4958.36 --> 4961.719
doesn't matter what they do what they

4960.36 --> 4963.32
say whether they're right whether they

4961.719 --> 4965.92
were wrong whether they have any idea

4963.32 --> 4970.32
what's going on the only thing is that

4965.92 --> 4973.36
matters is that they break the mind and

4970.32 --> 4976.28
will of their opponents which is

4973.36 --> 4981.32
everybody that doesn't work for them and

4976.28 --> 4981.32
that's how they are and it's very

5001.48 --> 5004.48
noticeable

5015.08 --> 5018.92
is any country with the royal family

5022.4 --> 5028.08
corrupt who

5025.08 --> 5028.08
knows

5031.48 --> 5036.879999999999
probably what do they actually do for

5034.639 --> 5039.1990000000005
all the money they get well that all

5036.88 --> 5042.0
depends you

5039.199 --> 5044.5199999999995
know what do royal family really do it

5042.0 --> 5045.96
all depends on if they're there just to

5044.52 --> 5049.52
like try

5045.96 --> 5051.8
to parasite on everybody and just have

5049.52 --> 5055.56
themselves stay there or whether they

5051.8 --> 5055.56
really care about the people it all

5056.0 --> 5064.36
depends I mean nobility can be very

5060.12 --> 5064.36
useful for diplomacy

5065.639 --> 5072.12
and it

5067.239 --> 5074.839999999999
can help with cultural

5072.12 --> 5077.5599999999995
development especially in transition

5074.84 --> 5080.08
ages yeah although yeah thanks for the

5077.56 --> 5082.280000000001
help transitioning into eating Z bugs

5080.08 --> 5085.679
definitely go [Â __Â ] yourself there yeah

5082.28 --> 5089.44
we don't need your help Maxima

5085.679 --> 5091.36
thanks yeah you go eat your [Â __Â ] bugs

5089.44 --> 5094.36
in

5091.36 --> 5094.36
jail

5109.4 --> 5117.28
go 20 times yeah it's

5113.119 --> 5120.719
yeah but I mean they do that now

5117.28 --> 5122.759999999999
Palpatine because they are corrupt Yeah

5120.719 --> 5126.56
the more corrupt you are the more like

5122.76 --> 5128.639
quickly exploit as much as you can

5126.56 --> 5130.719
before I get kicked out that's why they

5128.639 --> 5133.159000000001
do it that's why they have 20 holidays

5130.719 --> 5134.96
because it's like yeah these any one of

5133.159 --> 5137.96
these holidays could be their last so

5134.96 --> 5141.639
they're like just grabbing grabbing

5137.96 --> 5145.6
grabbing all everything just enjoying it

5141.639 --> 5145.6
while they still can that's why they do

5146.52 --> 5151.280000000001
that cuz they know they're corrupted

5148.96 --> 5154.4
they know they're going to be

5151.28 --> 5156.4
unseated because of what they've done

5154.4 --> 5159.839999999999
because of the conspiracy that they've

5156.4 --> 5163.159
become part of anti-human satanic

5159.84 --> 5166.639
anti-nationalist Marxist communist

5163.159 --> 5170.199
conspiracy liberal emperium they have

5166.639 --> 5172.76
sided with it and that means they're

5170.199 --> 5172.759999999999
going to

5174.119 --> 5180.799999999999
end because when you side with Satan you

5177.48 --> 5184.32
might ride the tiger for a

5180.8 --> 5187.4800000000005
while there's no no way it's going to

5184.32 --> 5190.639
end and you surviving

5187.48 --> 5194.678999999999
it it just doesn't happen and they know

5190.639 --> 5196.84
it and that's why they do it that's why

5194.679 --> 5199.8
they're just more

5196.84 --> 5202.4800000000005
blatantly sucking and parasiting of

5199.8 --> 5205.52
everybody and taking those extra

5202.48 --> 5209.0
vacations being even more

5205.52 --> 5211.1990000000005
arrogant because they know at the end of

5209.0 --> 5213.48
the ride they're

5211.199 --> 5215.5199999999995
gone

5213.48 --> 5218.5599999999995
because they were dumb enough to be part

5215.52 --> 5221.4400000000005
of this and think that with everything

5218.56 --> 5224.92
that was in the plans that they could

5221.44 --> 5227.839999999999
win that that they could like completely

5224.92 --> 5230.56
and utterly transform the entire world

5227.84 --> 5233.84
and how people are like a freaking Star

5230.56 --> 5235.96
Trek futuristic episode yeah they

5233.84 --> 5238.639
thought that they could just do

5235.96 --> 5241.4800000000005
that they they could just break the will

5238.639 --> 5244.84
of everybody and just do that and Usher

5241.48 --> 5248.839999999999
in a new Neo feudal age of

5244.84 --> 5253.119000000001
complete mind control this is no no

5248.84 --> 5255.56
you're all going to die for what you've

5253.119 --> 5258.96
done you're going to

5255.56 --> 5263.76
suffer for what you've done and what you

5258.96 --> 5263.76
wanted to do what you became part

5271.119 --> 5274.119
of

5275.88 --> 5280.88
oh you're on to Flat Earth stuff now

5290.239 --> 5295.678999999999
okay Earth curve is just a bit

5293.159 --> 5297.879999999999
further now nobody claimed you could see

5295.679 --> 5301.04
Earth curve Rich

5297.88 --> 5303.04
G The Horizon was never

5301.04 --> 5304.92
geometric

5303.04 --> 5310.239
nobody ever claimed the Horizon with

5304.92 --> 5310.2390000000005
geometric you can't see the geometric

5314.48 --> 5320.5199999999995
Horizon do you see this image of me on

5318.44 --> 5323.919999999999
your screen it could be on your mobile

5320.52 --> 5326.96
or on your monitor it's not really

5323.92 --> 5329.639
there it's actually in a slightly

5326.96 --> 5332.36
different position because it's slightly

5329.639 --> 5334.8
refracted in comparion to the Earth

5332.36 --> 5337.639
curve didn't you know

5334.8 --> 5339.719
that nothing what you see is actually

5337.639 --> 5342.400000000001
where it is it's slightly somewhere else

5339.719 --> 5342.4
because it's all

5343.52 --> 5347.719
bent that's the world they live

5352.56 --> 5358.6
in at what age is a person considered

5355.36 --> 5360.92
middle age I don't

5358.6 --> 5363.92
care me

5360.92 --> 5363.92
probably

5373.48 --> 5377.32
I'm already past middle but it's because

5375.48 --> 5379.199
the average age has gone down

5377.32 --> 5381.799999999999
dramatically but the average age has

5379.199 --> 5384.119
gone down dramatically because so many

5381.8 --> 5384.8
people are medically completely [Â __Â ]

5384.119 --> 5387.719
and

5384.8 --> 5390.08
irresponsible and have gotten themselves

5387.719 --> 5393.32
on average into things that got gets

5390.08 --> 5394.719
them killed and that dramatically lowers

5393.32 --> 5397.44
the average

5394.719 --> 5400.159
lifespan so by the standard of the

5397.44 --> 5403.0
average retardation of people out there

5400.159 --> 5404.4
in this current age I am already past

5403.0 --> 5406.8
middle

5404.4 --> 5411.5599999999995
age but I'm pretty much sure I'm going

5406.8 --> 5411.56
to make it like a lot far farther

5415.04 --> 5419.56
so I'll call myself middle AG when I'm

5420.84 --> 5423.84
60

5430.48 --> 5437.959999999999
live forever no not forever just

5434.84 --> 5441.08
long and I mean my dad the way he is

5437.96 --> 5442.92
doing right now if this continues the

5441.08 --> 5445.44
way it does and there's no bizarre

5442.92 --> 5448.719
unexpected things which there haven't

5445.44 --> 5450.799999999999
been other than previous issues like get

5448.719 --> 5453.119
back a little worse well he knows how to

5450.8 --> 5455.320000000001
tackle all of that he's very connected

5453.119 --> 5459.0
like my dad's not oh my God I got

5455.32 --> 5462.0
something I have to go to the hospital

5459.0 --> 5463.52
no yeah if if you live like that yeah

5462.0 --> 5465.239
you're going to die you're going to die

5463.52 --> 5469.639
very quick you're not going to grow very

5465.239 --> 5473.599999999999
old that way H huh yeah no my dad has

5469.639 --> 5475.36
his own medical system my medical system

5473.6 --> 5477.92
knowledge

5475.36 --> 5481.119
connected people that do remote healing

5477.92 --> 5482.52
that works extremely well he has

5481.119 --> 5485.719
alternative

5482.52 --> 5488.360000000001
like frequency based healing devices he

5485.719 --> 5489.92
has all this stuff all these knowledge

5488.36 --> 5493.48
all this

5489.92 --> 5495.159
techniques my dad could grow I'm very

5493.48 --> 5498.239
I'm actually kind of confident that he's

5495.159 --> 5500.44
definitely going to make it past 100 at

5498.239 --> 5500.44
this

5500.96 --> 5505.76
point like I am quite certain like he

5504.08 --> 5510.08
doesn't

5505.76 --> 5514.92
have the venerable Spirit not even close

5510.08 --> 5514.92
not even close he's still

5514.96 --> 5519.96
quick and so will I I will make it very

5518.0 --> 5522.4
long if I

5519.96 --> 5524.119
don't end

5522.4 --> 5528.159
myself

5524.119 --> 5533.48
from stress and all that

5528.159 --> 5535.839999999999
whatever if I don't tear my body down

5533.48 --> 5540.239
from stress and anxiety and all that

5535.84 --> 5540.2390000000005
crap but yeah I don't think I

5540.679 --> 5543.679
will

5547.44 --> 5552.199
what do you think I don't think what am

5549.239 --> 5552.199
I doing when i'm

5552.48 --> 5555.959999999999
60 I'm not

5557.6 --> 5563.76
thinking like if anything when I'm 60

5561.52 --> 5566.0
the world has got to be a very different

5563.76 --> 5571.0
place and I've got to be doing something

5566.0 --> 5573.52
else if I'd be 60 and doing exactly this

5571.0 --> 5577.199
there's no way

5573.52 --> 5580.320000000001
way I'd freaking kill

5577.199 --> 5582.5599999999995
myself there's no way I can be just

5580.32 --> 5586.0
doing this and being poor and everything

5582.56 --> 5586.0
like no that's not

5593.08 --> 5598.48
tolerable older starts to get yeah

5595.92 --> 5598.4800000000005
because you're a

5600.56 --> 5603.56
woman

5603.8 --> 5609.56
yeah I can still procreate after 60 you

5606.92 --> 5609.56
can't do

5611.239 --> 5616.32
that what age will you change my

5617.159 --> 5626.239
situation I don't know if I have the

5620.159 --> 5626.239
power to to like make a decision about

5627.719 --> 5633.2390000000005
that I have hopes I've had hopes for a 5

5631.239 --> 5636.5199999999995
years

5633.239 --> 5639.159
and has not worked out yet it might work

5636.52 --> 5640.719
out it might all go down the [Â __Â ] hole

5639.159 --> 5644.08
all of a

5640.719 --> 5644.08
sudden I don't

5660.48 --> 5663.48
know

5666.6 --> 5672.2390000000005
who knows maybe one day for some reason

5669.639 --> 5675.96
somebody actually just offers me a job

5672.239 --> 5679.08
or something that's a like something

5675.96 --> 5683.04
that actually has a

5679.08 --> 5683.04
point and that could change

5683.84 --> 5690.0
things right maybe I'm not counting on

5687.4 --> 5692.32
it there's nobody out there that I'd

5690.0 --> 5695.28
expect that from

5692.32 --> 5695.28
but you never really

5697.32 --> 5704.04
know maybe some Media Group out there

5700.96 --> 5706.679
becomes interested in what I talk about

5704.04 --> 5709.44
and it might be like hey you want to

5706.679 --> 5713.56
actually talk for a bigger

5709.44 --> 5715.719
crowd you could do that here just try to

5713.56 --> 5718.679
avoid this

5715.719 --> 5723.4
subject and then get paid for that and

5718.679 --> 5723.4
then yeah bye

5729.04 --> 5731.6
you never

5732.199 --> 5736.48
now what would be the perfect

5739.84 --> 5744.76
job if I'd know what would be the

5742.52 --> 5747.56
perfect job I'd be trying to get the

5744.76 --> 5747.56
perfect job

5750.4 --> 5753.4
Brianna

5753.92 --> 5759.92
am I registered for a different

5756.56 --> 5759.92
house not

5760.8 --> 5766.4800000000005
really now the only way to move to a

5763.08 --> 5766.48
better place is if I have

5767.92 --> 5777.52
money you understand there's literally

5772.4 --> 5781.159
nothing I can do about anything about my

5777.52 --> 5786.92
situation without an influx of money

5781.159 --> 5786.92
that 's literally nothing I can

5787.159 --> 5794.48
do let the finality of that statement

5791.679 --> 5794.4800000000005
sink in

5799.36 --> 5805.04
please then Russian vits would be making

5802.32 --> 5807.36
Arwin the sh vits well all depends what

5805.04 --> 5807.36
I'd be

5810.28 --> 5816.599999999999
doing it really does I mean if it's too

5813.88 --> 5819.04
shilly then I won't really be able to do

5816.6 --> 5821.0
anything but I mean if they're like hey

5819.04 --> 5823.159
I like the way you think and you like

5821.0 --> 5826.44
think about Revolution and all that talk

5823.159 --> 5828.839999999999
about that here you'll be like that guy

5826.44 --> 5831.36
the loud passionate guy from the group

5828.84 --> 5833.0
or something and yeah sure like just

5831.36 --> 5836.5199999999995
don't mention Flat

5833.0 --> 5838.639
Earth and that's like yeah that's

5836.52 --> 5840.719
reasonable like why the [Â __Â ] would I

5838.639 --> 5844.32
mention Flat Earth just don't talk about

5840.719 --> 5847.719
[Â __Â ] Elon Musk satellites on Mars here

5844.32 --> 5851.159
because you're going to get

5847.719 --> 5853.28
a a response

5851.159 --> 5855.119
right and they'll probably start

5853.28 --> 5856.92
bringing it up and then they'll start

5855.119 --> 5859.598999999999
talking about Flat Earth anyway because

5856.92 --> 5861.28
that's what bards do they can't help

5859.599 --> 5865.08
themselves

5861.28 --> 5865.08
yeah that's how it would

5870.199 --> 5876.32

that's it's going around it's very off

6712.0 --> 6714.239
this

6716.84 --> 6719.84
moment

6720.599 --> 6725.4800000000005
yeah oh an excellent teacher oh

6731.56 --> 6735.92
thanks yeah Palpatine I know I've been

6734.079 --> 6738.119
thinking about that I'm going to have

6735.92 --> 6740.4400000000005
some have to have some

6738.119 --> 6742.839999999999
serious like

6740.44 --> 6747.159
3D 3D

6742.84 --> 6749.4400000000005
developed CGI for that like I have

6747.159 --> 6753.598999999999
already in my

6749.44 --> 6756.36
mind like a thing where I do the the

6753.599 --> 6759.400000000001
cosmos with Neil degrass Tyson remember

6756.36 --> 6762.28
that in spaceship flying around I can do

6759.4 --> 6765.4
that I can do like a Mirror

6762.28 --> 6767.5599999999995
Universe version of that with my looping

6765.4 --> 6770.44
systems and basically explain everything

6767.56 --> 6772.4800000000005
and just be there in how I look and show

6770.44 --> 6774.36
like look Loop could be over this it

6772.48 --> 6778.959999999999
could be over that could be that and

6774.36 --> 6781.0
then actually see the 3D world like see

6778.96 --> 6782.719
that visually in front of you instead of

6781.0 --> 6785.56
me just like trying to describe it with

6782.719 --> 6789.119
my hands yeah that could be I'm going to

6785.56 --> 6795.96
need some very serious CGI support for

6789.119 --> 6799.4
that and I am not going to do that yeah

6795.96 --> 6801.76
not me I am not a 3D expert I will not

6799.4 --> 6801.759999999999
do that

6802.84 --> 6808.679
all

6804.719 --> 6812.32
right I will not be doing that video in

6808.679 --> 6814.32
my on my own it's not going to happen

6812.32 --> 6818.5199999999995
not going to happen in the near

6814.32 --> 6822.679
future I will need a 3D expert who's

6818.52 --> 6822.679
willing to do that with me

6822.88 --> 6827.0
together it's not going to be

6828.76 --> 6831.76
me

6834.44 --> 6838.36
that's going to be ace yeah I

6838.599 --> 6842.159000000001
know it would be

6842.48 --> 6848.32
epic never seen any drawings in the year

6845.8 --> 6850.360000000001
I've been running in okay I'll show it

6848.32 --> 6853.4
to you right now I mean those drawings

6850.36 --> 6853.4
are kind of old by

6858.679 --> 6861.679
now

6865.199 --> 6869.04
yeah wake up hard

6872.9 --> 6875.969999999999
[Music]

6876.28 --> 6881.28
disk I mean have piles and piles of

6888.679 --> 6891.679
imagery

6895.079 --> 6899.759999999999
right I'll show

6897.079 --> 6903.0
you I'll just go through the entire

6899.76 --> 6906.079000000001
freaking library of what I

6903.0 --> 6909.4
drew right so this is the

6906.079 --> 6912.759999999999
first it's a rectangular side

6909.4 --> 6916.598999999999
projection it this was the original

6912.76 --> 6921.599
drawing I used for my flat Earth Talks

6916.599 --> 6921.599
show to explain the antiqu

6927.04 --> 6932.599
right here is a really surreal version

6930.599 --> 6935.0
that's like one of my first shows when I

6932.599 --> 6939.4800000000005
was just like free flowing

6935.0 --> 6941.84
like another way to describe the special

6939.48 --> 6943.32
nonlinear projection with some

6941.84 --> 6946.360000000001
physicality assumption by his

6943.32 --> 6948.84
reification of Domes within it as a con

6946.36 --> 6950.719
it's just flee free this is like a this

6948.84 --> 6953.599
should be like a

6950.719 --> 6957.119
painting is just

6953.599 --> 6960.52
surreal I liked it though I like that I

6957.119 --> 6962.839999999999
made that and that even though it's just

6960.52 --> 6964.84
a bunch of pencil sketches like I can

6962.84 --> 6966.159000000001
still understand what it is that I'm

6964.84 --> 6971.88
looking

6966.159 --> 6974.32
at right oh yeah this was the idea

6971.88 --> 6977.639
of the

6974.32 --> 6981.5199999999995
edge like the edge of nons space like

6977.639 --> 6981.52
the barrier might not be a physical

6981.88 --> 6987.679
barrier yeah it might be no more space

6985.199 --> 6990.48
available and If you go there that

6987.679 --> 6992.76
there's like chunks of ice that are

6990.48 --> 6995.759999999999
literally right next

6992.76 --> 6997.88
to the end of space and that right

6995.76 --> 7000.280000000001
behind it you can just see the stars and

6997.88 --> 7002.400000000001
the moon and maybe even a sunrise even

7000.28 --> 7004.92
though there's literally physically

7002.4 --> 7007.4
nothing there but you might still see

7004.92 --> 7010.719
the celestials there even though there's

7007.4 --> 7012.92
no matter there

7010.719 --> 7016.84
so that is if you would run into a

7012.92 --> 7019.639
barrier what could it be like

7016.84 --> 7023.04
right I definitely think that you'll see

7019.639 --> 7025.8
the stars and the moon and everything on

7023.04 --> 7028.199
the other side you'll see it through

7025.8 --> 7031.079000000001
that barrier or whatever that is the end

7028.199 --> 7033.28
of space and this was a drawing I made

7031.079 --> 7037.719
to like explain

7033.28 --> 7040.599
that all right so here's the Flat Earth

7037.719 --> 7042.92
shapes all the different conceptions

7040.599 --> 7046.159000000001
that I had really early

7042.92 --> 7049.719
on with of course the flat Globe at the

7046.159 --> 7049.719
at the bottom of that which is

7049.92 --> 7053.599
still like that's the the greatest mind

7052.48 --> 7057.4
[Â __Â ]

7053.599 --> 7059.1990000000005
ever like yeah well if it's looping in a

7057.4 --> 7061.079
very specific

7059.199 --> 7063.5599999999995
way

7061.079 --> 7067.119
then

7063.56 --> 7069.96
yeah a flat Globe like the the the

7067.119 --> 7071.88
surface all interconnects

7069.96 --> 7075.04
just as if it were a

7071.88 --> 7078.599
globe but it is literally

7075.04 --> 7081.239
flat and every part of the surface is

7078.599 --> 7084.2390000000005
parallel to every other part but it

7081.239 --> 7088.079
connects like a globe though and yeah we

7084.239 --> 7091.119
can't make logical sense of that so it's

7088.079 --> 7094.44
just a flat Globe it's flat we don't

7091.119 --> 7098.32
know why it fits but it fits like a

7094.44 --> 7100.28
globe but it's flat the flat Globe

7098.32 --> 7102.5199999999995
literally called it like the second show

7100.28 --> 7105.44
I ever

7102.52 --> 7107.599
uploaded yeah that that is how early I

7105.44 --> 7110.598999999999
was with all of

7107.599 --> 7110.599
this

7114.719 --> 7119.599
right what is

7116.56 --> 7123.719
this the same

7119.599 --> 7127.28
one it's the old pencil sketch version

7123.719 --> 7132.119
without the text ah here's a flying

7127.28 --> 7132.119
City recharging itself above a

7134.56 --> 7140.679
pyramid s Heaven one look yeah that's

7137.84 --> 7142.84
just an idea of like layers like

7140.679 --> 7144.56
multiple Realms above each other and

7142.84 --> 7148.1990000000005
that they might have been the original

7144.56 --> 7150.52
Seven hells and seven

7148.199 --> 7152.919999999999
Heavens that we're in the middle it's

7150.52 --> 7154.639
the idea that there are more Realms

7152.92 --> 7159.0
above each

7154.639 --> 7161.4400000000005
other that's it like that's all that is

7159.0 --> 7165.679
is just one idea

7161.44 --> 7169.839999999999
right but yeah this totem like maybe

7165.679 --> 7169.84
right it could be because it could be

7172.4 --> 7177.32
metaphysical the thing is in the

7174.44 --> 7180.5199999999995
spiritual realm this might be real yeah

7177.32 --> 7186.4
my Dark World experience might have been

7180.52 --> 7186.400000000001
in this layer the other layer a parallel

7187.159 --> 7192.92
world but this is kind of a re this

7190.119 --> 7197.5599999999995
concept is sort of a reification of that

7192.92 --> 7199.8
parallel world idea being physically

7197.56 --> 7204.079000000001
literal

7199.8 --> 7205.88
so yeah that's it I mean spiritually it

7204.079 --> 7209.44
might be literally like this like we

7205.88 --> 7212.32
have a whole bunch of parallel spiritual

7209.44 --> 7215.28
bodies our our root is here in the

7212.32 --> 7217.92
Physical Realm but in the other

7215.28 --> 7219.679
spiritual Realms we might have spiritual

7217.92 --> 7221.639
parallels that all do things

7219.679 --> 7223.159
simultaneously together it might all be

7221.639 --> 7225.88
intricate to one

7223.159 --> 7228.5599999999995
another like maybe that is why our

7225.88 --> 7230.88
subconscious has so incredible amounts

7228.56 --> 7233.92
of knowledge and insight that we

7230.88 --> 7238.2390000000005
consciously can't

7233.92 --> 7242.8
handle because all of that subconscious

7238.239 --> 7245.638999999999
is actually like 14 other bodies of our

7242.8 --> 7248.360000000001
spiritually that are all researched and

7245.639 --> 7251.28
working together and that that is why we

7248.36 --> 7252.598999999999
are subconsciously much smarter than we

7251.28 --> 7257.759999999999
tend to be

7252.599 --> 7257.76
consciously right it's just heavy

7258.199 --> 7262.839999999999
metaphysics

7259.8 --> 7266.400000000001
anyway yeah Giant floating city

7262.84 --> 7266.400000000001
recharging itself over a

7267.52 --> 7273.56
pyramid in the

7270.719 --> 7277.36
past that's a vision I

7273.56 --> 7279.280000000001
had this might have been the Pyramid of

7277.36 --> 7282.36
Giza well there would have been the

7279.28 --> 7285.119
others then I didn't draw it like that

7282.36 --> 7287.4
but the point is is that yeah the idea

7285.119 --> 7287.4
it's

7287.88 --> 7293.76
a what do you call that stone based

7291.639 --> 7296.4400000000005
electric generator that use water flow

7293.76 --> 7299.119000000001
underneath the pyramid in

7296.44 --> 7301.079
channels and that charges the stone that

7299.119 --> 7304.4
builds up a tension almost like a Tesla

7301.079 --> 7306.28
coil and that tension it can be used for

7304.4 --> 7309.28
all kinds of purposes to charge the

7306.28 --> 7313.0
environment to maybe like have like

7309.28 --> 7316.28
Tesla like lamps like gas lamps it's

7313.0 --> 7318.199
just a a bulb with gas in it and because

7316.28 --> 7320.96
of the pyramid there would be like

7318.199 --> 7324.04
electric light it could be that and it

7320.96 --> 7327.199
could have draw further as much as to

7324.04 --> 7330.719
like be a really heavy power charging

7327.199 --> 7333.719
station for Giant floating

7330.719 --> 7335.28
cities that are talked about like in the

7333.719 --> 7337.36
old

7335.28 --> 7340.28
Hindu

7337.36 --> 7342.119
Legends yeah because pyramids are

7340.28 --> 7343.8
definitely going to be that old so what

7342.119 --> 7345.839999999999
was their function I think they were

7343.8 --> 7348.76
charging

7345.84 --> 7350.96
stations they were industrial devices

7348.76 --> 7355.84
that's what I think about

7350.96 --> 7355.84
pyramids right so here's a other

7357.36 --> 7361.28
projection of the looping

7361.48 --> 7367.959999999999
realm right so you could think of the

7364.679 --> 7369.8
looping realm like it is a

7367.96 --> 7372.44
tunnel

7369.8 --> 7376.28
now it's unfolded the

7372.44 --> 7379.4
tunnel but you like normally it's like a

7376.28 --> 7381.199
tube it's a tube and there's more yeah

7379.4 --> 7383.839999999999
that tube just keeps going north and

7381.199 --> 7385.839999999999
south that's a rectangular looping

7383.84 --> 7387.4800000000005
projection model that I'm basically

7385.84 --> 7389.04
going with although it's still

7387.48 --> 7392.199
oversimplified because it's still

7389.04 --> 7394.239
assuming that the span between East and

7392.199 --> 7396.638999999999
West the total amount of span within the

7394.239 --> 7400.879999999999
loop is equal

7396.639 --> 7400.88
everywhere which is contestable

7401.079 --> 7405.199
right and now we're going to go to The

7403.36 --> 7409.44
Irregular

7405.199 --> 7412.638999999999
looping systems those those sketches

7409.44 --> 7416.5199999999995
right so this is like the Christmas tree

7412.639 --> 7418.56
looping system where within each realm

7416.52 --> 7424.1990000000005
segment the

7418.56 --> 7427.159000000001
South has is wider than the

7424.199 --> 7429.598999999999
North it's like a semi disc system it's

7427.159 --> 7431.199
not really a dis it's just there is less

7429.599 --> 7434.719
room in the north than there is in the

7431.199 --> 7436.799999999999
South and it might be The Passage

7434.719 --> 7440.4800000000005
through to the other realm might be very

7436.8 --> 7443.159000000001
specific there's only one part of the

7440.48 --> 7448.718999999999
Southern segment that would lead to

7443.159 --> 7450.92
entry into the next realm from the

7448.719 --> 7452.52
north and that if you go north you

7450.92 --> 7456.079
always end up South but you always end

7452.52 --> 7458.360000000001
up in that one exit of the south of the

7456.079 --> 7461.36
next realm segment that's why it kind of

7458.36 --> 7464.719
would look like this Christmas tree

7461.36 --> 7468.839999999999
model right then you have the basically

7464.719 --> 7471.76
the flat Globe model with multiple realm

7468.84 --> 7474.4400000000005
option and that's how this would connect

7471.76 --> 7477.360000000001
and this this should look very

7474.44 --> 7479.4
familiar this pattern the grid

7477.36 --> 7482.88
specifically there are map projections

7479.4 --> 7484.679
in which the Earth realm is literally

7482.88 --> 7486.84
shown like

7484.679 --> 7490.52
this it's a little

7486.84 --> 7493.159000000001
broader when they do that so this should

7490.52 --> 7496.320000000001
look very familiar for a

7493.159 --> 7499.36
reason yeah it's like oh it's a glob

7496.32 --> 7503.4
projection yeah but it's literally flat

7499.36 --> 7505.4
though so if there's a flat Globe this

7503.4 --> 7508.48
is kind of what it would look

7505.4 --> 7511.759999999999
like in a map

7508.48 --> 7514.638999999999
projection right and then there's the

7511.76 --> 7518.119000000001
the Weir the system in which the equator

7514.639 --> 7519.400000000001
is measured a circle because I did take

7518.119 --> 7522.839999999999
that into a

7519.4 --> 7526.44
count it's like yeah it is actually ukan

7522.84 --> 7529.119000000001
Circle but then outside of the realm

7526.44 --> 7532.96
which is this sort of

7529.119 --> 7537.32
disc outside of the realm might be

7532.96 --> 7540.76
another realm but that realm is exactly

7537.32 --> 7542.719
the same size so the equator in that

7540.76 --> 7547.679
realm is the same

7542.719 --> 7549.8
size as the equator in in our

7547.679 --> 7553.4400000000005
Realm

7549.8 --> 7556.400000000001
even though that realm is outside of the

7553.44 --> 7559.558999999999
circle of our own realm and then you get

7556.4 --> 7560.598999999999
really weird spatial anomalies like how

7559.559 --> 7564.400000000001
does that

7560.599 --> 7565.92
fit it wouldn't be able to unless space

7564.4 --> 7568.719
is not entirely

7565.92 --> 7572.88
linear and then you get like conundrums

7568.719 --> 7576.88
like uh so is everything on the inner

7572.88 --> 7579.1990000000005
ring smaller than in this ring and is

7576.88 --> 7582.639
everything in the outer ring Lar

7579.199 --> 7585.119
larger and that if you move that your

7582.639 --> 7587.599
size scales up with it is there

7585.119 --> 7589.88
something really weird going on here it

7587.599 --> 7589.88
could

7589.92 --> 7598.119
be right so this is a potential thing

7594.96 --> 7601.719
that the realm could be like a disc in a

7598.119 --> 7603.598999999999
disc in a disc or a disc out of a disc

7601.719 --> 7606.92
out of a disc out of a dis and it's all

7603.599 --> 7609.8
the same size very surreal very very

7606.92 --> 7613.4400000000005
very surreal but it could

7609.8 --> 7615.400000000001
be right oh yeah here's yeah bit of a

7613.44 --> 7616.598999999999
side on view perspective it's not really

7615.4 --> 7619.4
relevant

7616.599 --> 7623.119000000001
anymore it's from

7619.4 --> 7627.679
2017 oh here's the original looping ah

7623.119 --> 7630.32
here's the sunlight manifest yeah so on

7627.679 --> 7632.4800000000005
the right we get to see how how most

7630.32 --> 7635.48
people think of the

7632.48 --> 7638.36
sun flat earth based they think it's

7635.48 --> 7639.36
this ball of light that's hovering over

7638.36 --> 7641.639
us

7639.36 --> 7643.88
and Shining at us like a

7641.639 --> 7646.599
lamp but in

7643.88 --> 7649.92
reality it doesn't have a position if

7646.599 --> 7652.599
you'd approach that virtual position

7649.92 --> 7655.119
You' find that it isn't approachable

7652.599 --> 7657.92
that the angular size of it doesn't

7655.119 --> 7660.5199999999995
increase as you approach the virtual

7657.92 --> 7663.119
position where you thought it

7660.52 --> 7665.320000000001
was and then you can think of it

7663.119 --> 7667.5199999999995
differently once you realize that and go

7665.32 --> 7671.079
to the left side of it and realize like

7667.52 --> 7674.559
no this the sun is probably an angular

7671.079 --> 7677.28
manifestation where you are in the realm

7674.559 --> 7679.599
determines how that angular

7677.28 --> 7684.04
manifestation appears to

7679.599 --> 7686.559
you at an insurmountable apparent

7684.04 --> 7688.239
distance so you can never approach it it

7686.559 --> 7691.559
will always stay the same apparent

7688.239 --> 7695.119
distance but the angle that that

7691.559 --> 7696.639
appearance that appearance has to you

7695.119 --> 7699.199
will

7696.639 --> 7701.679
change depending on your and where you

7699.199 --> 7704.5199999999995
are but it will always have that

7701.679 --> 7707.28
apparent distance that cannot be

7704.52 --> 7710.040000000001
overcome and when you realize that yeah

7707.28 --> 7712.48
then the picture of how you see the sun

7710.04 --> 7714.719
would be more like on the left than on

7712.48 --> 7716.879999999999
the right which yeah the right is a very

7714.719 --> 7719.719
physical assumption bias physicality

7716.88 --> 7723.400000000001
assumption bias based conception of the

7719.719 --> 7727.2390000000005
Sun that is absolutely wrong provably

7723.4 --> 7730.199
wrong and the left is more likely to

7727.239 --> 7733.638999999999
show how

7730.199 --> 7736.28
you could depict the appearance of the

7733.639 --> 7736.28
Sun to the

7736.8 --> 7742.079000000001
Observer that's how I do it

7739.199 --> 7745.759999999999
anyway right and then you get to

7742.079 --> 7745.759999999999
the tube

7749.119 --> 7757.32
Earth with Space City which was part of

7752.52 --> 7760.96
my vision too saw Space City in

7757.32 --> 7763.84
vision like one of the first go

7760.96 --> 7765.84
Visions I would arise move straight

7763.84 --> 7771.119000000001
upward and then there was this weird

7765.84 --> 7774.639
floating city like way up above the Flat

7771.119 --> 7775.92
Earth I have no idea if any of that is

7774.639 --> 7778.88
remotely

7775.92 --> 7783.32
real but this is a picture I drew from

7778.88 --> 7786.4400000000005
it it's a multiple realm segment

7783.32 --> 7788.719
system and the the Dome thing the bubble

7786.44 --> 7790.079
that you see is basically like a fourth

7788.719 --> 7793.52
dimensional

7790.079 --> 7796.04
Celestial system so in which they are

7793.52 --> 7798.4800000000005
have a literal position but within it

7796.04 --> 7801.119
the realm could just

7798.48 --> 7804.36
move you could just move around and the

7801.119 --> 7806.48
bubble will stay surrounding at you

7804.36 --> 7808.239
which is exactly how it appears right

7806.48 --> 7811.159
but you can never reach it in the 3D

7808.239 --> 7813.718999999999
realm but if it's a fourth dimensional

7811.159 --> 7816.119
thing the

7813.719 --> 7819.44
celestials then you could see it from

7816.119 --> 7822.36
that perspective and then you always be

7819.44 --> 7825.28
in the middle of that bubble as the

7822.36 --> 7827.92
realm moves underneath

7825.28 --> 7830.559
you so this is basically like a fourth

7827.92 --> 7830.559
dimensional

7831.36 --> 7836.679
perspective little

7834.48 --> 7839.678999999999
complicated right let's see what else we

7836.679 --> 7842.2390000000005
got ah we got tunnel

7839.679 --> 7845.88
Earth this

7842.239 --> 7849.879999999999
is where's that that earlier

7845.88 --> 7852.559
picture let me see where was it

7849.88 --> 7852.559
the ear

7853.44 --> 7858.28
picture right I'll just scroll back a

7855.76 --> 7858.280000000001
bit a whole

7859.92 --> 7865.52
bunch this yeah what I showed here this

7863.4 --> 7867.04
is like pulled

7865.52 --> 7870.719
apart

7867.04 --> 7874.159
and this is if it were connected and you

7870.719 --> 7877.159
were at the center of it supposedly now

7874.159 --> 7880.239
you're surrounded by the flat

7877.159 --> 7882.92
Realm that is made to be

7880.239 --> 7885.5199999999995
interconnected but it's all in reality

7882.92 --> 7888.4800000000005
it's literally

7885.52 --> 7892.079000000001
flat but if you

7888.48 --> 7895.04
can't accept that like yeah it doesn't

7892.079 --> 7897.679
make any logical geometric sense to us

7895.04 --> 7899.199
and that it's flat and still has all

7897.679 --> 7901.159
that connection all that so we're just

7899.199 --> 7902.678999999999
going to think of it as a tube then well

7901.159 --> 7905.119
that's then how you think of the earth

7902.679 --> 7907.32
you're going to think it's a tube it's

7905.119 --> 7909.159
all flat but you can't deal with that so

7907.32 --> 7910.599
you're just going to think of it as a

7909.159 --> 7912.679
tube

7910.599 --> 7915.0
then right and then it's the final

7912.679 --> 7916.28
picture and that's just ill Earth which

7915.0 --> 7920.52
was an

7916.28 --> 7920.5199999999995
idea of also how do

7921.559 --> 7927.159000000001
you

7923.88 --> 7930.96
show the Flat Earth in a special

7927.159 --> 7932.44
nonlinear way how it could be and this

7930.96 --> 7936.4800000000005
was an idea of

7932.44 --> 7936.48
it so that's kind of

7936.599 --> 7942.52
Fantastical and the Earth realm would be

7939.36 --> 7942.5199999999995
on this little disc

7943.4 --> 7949.079
here and these lines represent how if

7946.96 --> 7950.44
you would go to the north there would be

7949.079 --> 7953.36
like this

7950.44 --> 7956.28
long um a lot more space than would

7953.36 --> 7959.96
logically fit in that small circle if

7956.28 --> 7962.88
you go far enough you'd literally end up

7959.96 --> 7962.88
in the southern

7964.159 --> 7969.839999999999
realm in a Southern realm that if you

7967.639 --> 7971.84
then go North far enough you'd end up in

7969.84 --> 7975.599
the known Realms that we are living in

7971.84 --> 7978.52
right now right so yeah that's it this

7975.599 --> 7980.119000000001
is my entire Flat Earth picture library

7978.52 --> 7982.280000000001
all the sketches that I've drawn over

7980.119 --> 7982.28
the

7985.719 --> 7989.119
years there you

7991.44 --> 7998.04
go I hope that was entertaining to

7995.88 --> 8001.400000000001
you I'm going to take a two-minute bre

7998.04 --> 8001.4
break now I'll be right

8026.96 --> 8029.96
back

8103.119 --> 8106.679
so I hope you all appreciated

8109.52 --> 8116.96
that show who gives a [Â __Â ]

8112.679 --> 8119.32
clammy what you want my pencil sketches

8116.96 --> 8122.92
of the entire Earth realm to be

8119.32 --> 8126.36
perfectly correct excuse

8122.92 --> 8128.32
me that literally like the continence

8126.36 --> 8131.28
even being

8128.32 --> 8134.079
recognizable was just there to like kind

8131.28 --> 8136.159
of help you get the understanding of

8134.079 --> 8139.44
that it was supposed to be

8136.159 --> 8143.04
representing our realm that is all it

8139.44 --> 8146.239
wasn't map accurate clammy it was me

8143.04 --> 8148.48
literally pencil sketching it I'm sorry

8146.239 --> 8150.04
if it's not accurate in according to the

8148.48 --> 8153.04
official

8150.04 --> 8153.04
Maps

8154.0 --> 8161.559
jeez I'm not a map maker you know I just

8157.84 --> 8163.28
sketched it to roughly look enough like

8161.559 --> 8166.76
the Earth realm in order for you to be

8163.28 --> 8171.88
able to recognize it that is

8166.76 --> 8171.88
all don't apologize to me yeah

8174.239 --> 8179.718999999999
that's Trin tobacco Ma

8181.159 --> 8185.36
what what does that have to do with

8202.639 --> 8209.16
anything want to visit one of them

8206.359 --> 8212.960000000001
okay also support your local

8209.16 --> 8217.439
Arwin I'd say isn't that worth some

8212.96 --> 8217.438999999998
support has Today's Show been very

8236.599 --> 8239.599
interesting

8263.359 --> 8267.16
don't like to be called The CW word well

8265.16 --> 8268.599
then don't ask any more freaking

8267.16 --> 8271.519
personal

8268.599 --> 8274.479
questions yeah I mean it glamy I don't

8271.519 --> 8277.719000000001
want to hear you say that anymore next

8274.479 --> 8279.559
time I'm going to kick you out yeah

8277.719 --> 8282.518999999998
my

8279.559 --> 8285.319
detailed ways of going about in my

8282.519 --> 8288.519
private life are none of your damn

8285.319 --> 8291.92
business don't ask me about that

8288.519 --> 8294.599
anymore ask me about the subjects that I

8291.92 --> 8294.599
talk about

8296.519 --> 8299.519
instead

8320.559 --> 8324.559
right 2 hours 60

8326.24 --> 8330.119999999999
minutes we're back remember the problem

8328.24 --> 8331.8
of paint trying to pain in Plants

8330.12 --> 8334.719000000001
genetically modified give them the

8331.8 --> 8338.199999999999
ability yeah if only genetics were

8334.719 --> 8338.199999999999
actually real like

8338.479 --> 8346.679
that so even the whole genetic I own

8342.08 --> 8350.24
everything is just a Ponzi scheme it's a

8346.679 --> 8354.88
scam it only works if people actually

8350.24 --> 8354.88
believe that genetics are real like

8355.16 --> 8361.96
that it's like oh I'm patenting your

8359.399 --> 8364.84
your soul I'm going to patent your soul

8361.96 --> 8368.479
I'm like going to do and now your soul

8364.84 --> 8371.719000000001
slightly different and now I own you

8368.479 --> 8375.16
because I altered your

8371.719 --> 8377.839999999998
soul and I can now patent your soul so

8375.16 --> 8381.599
you're mine now because I

8377.84 --> 8384.719000000001
did and now I've patented your soul

8381.599 --> 8386.439
you're mine now you legally have to do

8384.719 --> 8388.479
what I tell you to

8386.439 --> 8393.319
do

8388.479 --> 8393.319
HH huh how about

8401.28 --> 8406.76
that I'm gonna do that actually why not

8404.399 --> 8409.96
I'm just going to like at the patent

8406.76 --> 8413.56
office like yeah

8409.96 --> 8415.438999999998
I I I want to patent people's Souls I'm

8413.56 --> 8418.359
going to slightly modify them and then

8415.439 --> 8421.720000000001
patent them it's like oh what you want

8418.359 --> 8424.76
physical evidence yeah I'm sorry maybe

8421.72 --> 8427.96
I'll just do a bunch of chemicals like

8424.76 --> 8430.960000000001
just get get them to like with their

8427.96 --> 8432.599999999999
will in print on water that I can then

8430.96 --> 8434.72
freeze to prove that it has been

8432.6 --> 8436.479000000001
influenced then we take that water that

8434.72 --> 8438.519999999999
has been influenced by the person that's

8436.479 --> 8440.319
obviously containing some of their soul

8438.52 --> 8442.880000000001
then we put a bunch of chemicals on them

8440.319 --> 8445.88
and then we heat it and evaporate it and

8442.88 --> 8448.479
then we condense the evaporation and

8445.88 --> 8450.96
then we like let let it recrystallize

8448.479 --> 8453.039999999999
and the patterns it's going to form

8450.96 --> 8455.919999999998
that's their

8453.04 --> 8460.319000000001
soul yeah

8455.92 --> 8462.56
really yeah and and because we altered

8460.319 --> 8466.319
it by

8462.56 --> 8468.96
doing now that means that like yeah your

8466.319 --> 8471.56
soul is now my pattern I own that

8468.96 --> 8473.039999999999
pattern for your soul because I I

8471.56 --> 8479.24
altered it slightly

8473.04 --> 8479.240000000002
doing yeah so you own I own you now

8480.8 --> 8489.438999999998
huh I mean how far off am I with the

8486.52 --> 8493.960000000001
genetically modified

8489.439 --> 8496.92
scam do describing this how far away

8493.96 --> 8499.399
from that is it it's not really that far

8496.92 --> 8499.399
away at

8505.64 --> 8509.24
all am I right

8512.6 --> 8518.54
Professor back

8515.47 --> 8518.539999999999
[Music]

8536.16 --> 8539.16
pending

8539.84 --> 8544.960000000001
I mean I'm sorry but I think that that

8542.399 --> 8548.68
process that I described how to like

8544.96 --> 8551.96
determine what somebody's soul is is

8548.68 --> 8555.84
probably more legitimate than how they

8551.96 --> 8559.839999999998
establish that something has a virus in

8555.84 --> 8561.359
it yeah my process really when you think

8559.84 --> 8564.56
about it when you listen to the full

8561.359 --> 8567.439
details sounds more

8564.56 --> 8571.0
reasonable yeah and that's not a joke

8567.439 --> 8574.359
that isn't actually I mean that what I

8571.0 --> 8577.64
described on how to prove something

8574.359 --> 8581.16
contains the soul of

8577.64 --> 8584.439
somebody that process that I described

8581.16 --> 8587.319
is more legitimate than the

8584.439 --> 8591.08
process that is used to establish

8587.319 --> 8591.08
whether something contains a

8591.52 --> 8595.24
virus yeah that's a

8596.08 --> 8599.08
fact

8628.479 --> 8630.679999999998
right anyway I hope you've been enjoying

8629.96 --> 8634.278999999999
the

8630.68 --> 8638.439
show don't forget to give it a Rogan

8634.279 --> 8638.439
up ah seeing eight that's

8638.56 --> 8643.24
good it's been a very interesting show

8641.6 --> 8644.76
it's good to go through the pictures

8643.24 --> 8646.359
every now and then I just have to do

8644.76 --> 8648.24
that I just have to like shove it in

8646.359 --> 8651.08
your face like hey look at that remember

8648.24 --> 8653.319
this remember that and to a lot of you

8651.08 --> 8657.16
it'll be like watching it all over again

8653.319 --> 8659.92
it's like whoa that oh wow what's that

8657.16 --> 8661.96
oh wow it's that when I look through it

8659.92 --> 8665.359
it's like oh wow what's that oh wow it's

8661.96 --> 8665.358999999999
that wow I made that

8667.84 --> 8673.76
wow and most of this stuff is like 10

8670.56 --> 8677.278999999999
years old can that's the crazy

8673.76 --> 8681.319
part like I was there very quick I had

8677.279 --> 8684.720000000001
like a lot of very Advanced detailed

8681.319 --> 8688.96
ideas in ways that people like they

8684.72 --> 8688.96
could barely even grab

8690.68 --> 8696.04
anything well everybody was still like

8693.24 --> 8698.119999999999
bickering about whether Earth curve is

8696.04 --> 8699.960000000001
visible or not and that kind of thing

8698.12 --> 8702.12
right I was like yeah what if it's like

8699.96 --> 8704.08
looping to this how could it be that and

8702.12 --> 8705.960000000001
like this is how you could project the

8704.08 --> 8709.319
looping system like everybody's like

8705.96 --> 8712.08
what the [Â __Â ] is he talking about we're

8709.319 --> 8715.68
discussing whether the Horizon is Earth

8712.08 --> 8717.359
curve what are you talking about yeah

8715.68 --> 8720.64
I'm talking about things that are going

8717.359 --> 8722.92
to be relevant in the future and I did

8720.64 --> 8726.84
mention that at the

8722.92 --> 8728.6
time when I did that very early on like

8726.84 --> 8730.359
yeah you're probably not going to get

8728.6 --> 8733.2
this but this is going to be very

8730.359 --> 8733.2
relevant in the

8740.2 --> 8746.92
future oh be like BBC just repeats all

8744.04 --> 8750.84
the time oh thanks thanks for the advice

8746.92 --> 8753.52
I don't give a [Â __Â ] yeah and hey

8750.84 --> 8756.359
repeating good old

8753.52 --> 8761.0
material is never bad hey if the BBC

8756.359 --> 8763.399000000001
wants to replay their old 80s

8761.0 --> 8766.72
documentary I'm all for it they were

8763.399 --> 8769.319
great it's good to see them back good to

8766.72 --> 8769.319
take another

8775.8 --> 8778.8
look

8784.04 --> 8790.52
Celestial North

8786.6 --> 8793.640000000001
description uh well Celestial North fits

8790.52 --> 8796.640000000001
perfectly in my antiqu picture clammy I

8793.64 --> 8796.64
already showed

8797.8 --> 8804.679999999998
that I mean I can show it again to point

8801.6 --> 8808.439
it out while I show

8804.68 --> 8811.319
it but I already have a picture that

8808.439 --> 8811.319
literally does

8816.68 --> 8827.76
that all right so the celestial

8822.359 --> 8830.640000000001
North this this the anti equator is

8827.76 --> 8835.52
Polaris right above

8830.64 --> 8838.88
you so on this entire line span Polaris

8835.52 --> 8840.24
is dead above you every point of this

8838.88 --> 8842.759999999998
straight

8840.24 --> 8846.199999999999
line just like at the anti equator in

8842.76 --> 8850.2
the South the Southern Cross would be

8846.2 --> 8855.16
right over you every part of this line

8850.2 --> 8856.880000000001
it's not a point it's a line and when

8855.16 --> 8860.039999999999
you walk that

8856.88 --> 8863.08
line Polaris will be right above you

8860.04 --> 8863.080000000002
every point on that

8865.68 --> 8868.68
line

8869.319 --> 8872.88
I should write it look is it a

8883.359 --> 8889.68
no I want to make a video though as I

8886.96 --> 8891.919999999998
already described it's a really good 3D

8889.68 --> 8898.64
animation and then I could do this sort

8891.92 --> 8898.64
of thing in a the cosmos type video

8902.6 --> 8905.68
writing a book

8906.439 --> 8911.800000000001
no maybe at the end of the ride maybe

8909.64 --> 8914.68
when it's like man I'm getting really

8911.8 --> 8916.599999999999
old I'm starting to like lose the

8914.68 --> 8919.319
concentration of my mind everybody's

8916.6 --> 8922.439
gotten even more [Â __Â ] than 20 years

8919.319 --> 8925.6
ago because they will yeah you think

8922.439 --> 8928.2
that that's going to end no now people

8925.6 --> 8931.84
double down on their stupidity onto

8928.2 --> 8931.84
extermination that's what people

8934.24 --> 8939.92
do and maybe by that time I'll be like

8937.6 --> 8941.68
I'm going to just try to summarize

8939.92 --> 8945.960000000001
everything that I've learned and just

8941.68 --> 8951.279
write it down in relatively simple

8945.96 --> 8952.679999999998
language to like hopefully be spared

8951.279 --> 8955.880000000001
until the

8952.68 --> 8958.52
madness that probably will only end with

8955.88 --> 8958.519999999999
extermin

8958.76 --> 8963.2
until that's passed and then everybody

8960.8 --> 8965.8
that's like woken freshly from the

8963.2 --> 8968.640000000001
Demonic Slaughter like all the demons

8965.8 --> 8970.199999999999
are dead killed each other Etc then they

8968.64 --> 8973.439
wake up and it's like

8970.2 --> 8977.0
whoa what what is there actually in the

8973.439 --> 8979.2
past like people will have room again to

8977.0 --> 8980.2
actually look around and like follow

8979.2 --> 8982.2
their

8980.2 --> 8984.319000000001
curiosity cuz before that time

8982.2 --> 8985.960000000001
everybody's just like ah we're trying to

8984.319 --> 8987.84
survive we're trying to Sur when you're

8985.96 --> 8990.319
just trying to to survive you don't have

8987.84 --> 8992.08
room for curiosity about anything you're

8990.319 --> 8995.479
just trying to survive so when that

8992.08 --> 8998.08
suddenly stops it's like hey hey oh

8995.479 --> 8998.08
what's this

8998.72 --> 9004.438999999998
guy what the hell is he talking about

9001.479 --> 9006.88
and then later right yeah I might become

9004.439 --> 9010.12
extremely popular but it's not in the

9006.88 --> 9012.839999999998
Beast system I am like an anti

9010.12 --> 9018.240000000002
antithesis of the be system which means

9012.84 --> 9021.2
like what I do is never going to be

9018.24 --> 9023.479
spreading around as long as the Beast

9021.2 --> 9025.640000000001
system exists it's not going to happen

9023.479 --> 9028.88
like because I am the

9025.64 --> 9028.88
antithesis in

9034.84 --> 9042.8
ways my Universal principle is diametric

9039.439 --> 9042.800000000001
D what does they know

9044.88 --> 9050.8
uh diametric strictly

9047.72 --> 9054.56
opposed to the globalist system where

9050.8 --> 9056.08
I'm like no wake everyone up and that'll

9054.56 --> 9060.16
fix it and

9056.08 --> 9064.279
there Paradigm is no you keep everybody

9060.16 --> 9067.359
dumb and that way you can

9064.279 --> 9068.479000000001
write how how you want things to be and

9067.359 --> 9073.359
control

9068.479 --> 9073.358999999999
them I am exactly the opposite in

9075.359 --> 9080.16
everything

9076.96 --> 9083.399
I'm actually for much more for like an

9080.16 --> 9087.0
what do you call that intellect

9083.399 --> 9089.68
cracy we actual provable

9087.0 --> 9092.479
smarts and not just oh being really

9089.68 --> 9097.68
quick at things but like having

9092.479 --> 9101.438999999998
real Dynamic smarts it's very difficult

9097.68 --> 9103.24
yeah but to have actually smart people

9101.439 --> 9105.6
in

9103.24 --> 9107.96
control like people that are smart

9105.6 --> 9110.359
enough to not corrupt because they know

9107.96 --> 9113.839999999998
that you become [Â __Â ] right we have

9110.359 --> 9116.12
to establish that too if you're evil the

9113.84 --> 9118.8
more you Embrace evil the Dumber you

9116.12 --> 9121.84
become like this is physically proven

9118.8 --> 9124.199999999999
now just look at the the the corrupted

9121.84 --> 9126.319
leadership they're all becoming more and

9124.2 --> 9128.84
more and more

9126.319 --> 9131.68
dumb they're not becoming smarter in

9128.84 --> 9131.68
power they're becoming

9135.279 --> 9138.960000000001
Dumber

9137.439 --> 9142.720000000001
and that's because of the corruption

9138.96 --> 9146.96
because corruption and evil makes you

9142.72 --> 9150.399
dumb physically does that it physically

9146.96 --> 9154.839999999998
makes you dumb power and Corruption

9150.399 --> 9154.84
makes you physically

9155.76 --> 9162.439
dumb so when a real smart person would

9159.0 --> 9164.8
want to rule and maintain their smarts

9162.439 --> 9167.319
they have to do it good they have to

9164.8 --> 9171.24
basically follow God's law

9167.319 --> 9173.72
they have to keep straight what is what

9171.24 --> 9176.76
and make choices within that knowledge

9173.72 --> 9179.358999999999
of what is what instead of deluding

9176.76 --> 9182.2
everybody about how things are in order

9179.359 --> 9182.2
to distract

9182.64 --> 9189.92
them right which is what's happening now

9186.399 --> 9191.599999999999
just you just lie about what is what and

9189.92 --> 9193.12
then enough people believe it and then

9191.6 --> 9198.16
you get away with

9193.12 --> 9198.160000000002
it instead of fixing the problems

9198.96 --> 9204.278999999999
so yeah as long as there's a new world

9201.92 --> 9205.6
order out there I'm not going to hit off

9204.279 --> 9206.960000000001
it's just not going to happen I

9205.6 --> 9209.08
guarantee

9206.96 --> 9212.72
it

9209.08 --> 9215.92
but once that really

9212.72 --> 9218.0
stops then I might have a chance to like

9215.92 --> 9220.6
become a little bit bigger I mean I'll

9218.0 --> 9222.319
not be the best out there there's guys

9220.6 --> 9225.6
that are also being held back that are

9222.319 --> 9229.56
like way more charismatic way more well

9225.6 --> 9231.6
spoken way more well read and even more

9229.56 --> 9233.479
creative and everything everything that

9231.6 --> 9236.399000000001
I have there's somebody out there that

9233.479 --> 9236.399
does it better than

9236.56 --> 9243.64
me but I managed to figure out a very

9240.72 --> 9243.64
specific type of

9243.68 --> 9249.84
trick with what I

9247.08 --> 9252.72
have finding the way through certain

9249.84 --> 9254.64
religious guidelines basically on what

9252.72 --> 9258.519999999999
to universally

9254.64 --> 9261.278999999999
do finding way through finding an

9258.52 --> 9261.279
exception

9263.279 --> 9269.08
like it's almost like reverse Buddhism

9265.84 --> 9272.279
you don't stay neutral you master the

9269.08 --> 9275.2
opponent good and evil you master them

9272.279 --> 9278.0
you understand them in order to gain

9275.2 --> 9278.0
control over

9280.88 --> 9286.16
them and you

9283.08 --> 9289.399
choose and you develop based on the

9286.16 --> 9289.399
knowledge of how things

9295.76 --> 9302.2
work it's not a GP it's a GL no it

9304.12 --> 9308.720000000001
yeah they call it GP though clly it is

9307.52 --> 9311.640000000001
technically

9308.72 --> 9315.24
GP it's all like it's only going to be

9311.64 --> 9318.119999999999
above a virtual point and as time

9315.24 --> 9321.68
changes as time passes then that per

9318.12 --> 9324.560000000001
Point shifts and turns into that line

9321.68 --> 9328.76
but it's technically still a

9324.56 --> 9334.68
point so GP isn't GL it's always

9328.76 --> 9334.68
GP but the GP over time forms a

9344.64 --> 9351.319
line so point that is it it becomes a

9348.84 --> 9351.319
line

9353.76 --> 9358.359
yes I'm

9355.8 --> 9361.399
incompatible with it for the most part

9358.359 --> 9361.399000000001
at every level

9366.68 --> 9372.76
yeah I just figured out very early that

9369.56 --> 9375.319
I'm like completely allergic I I really

9372.76 --> 9376.68
like Richard I talking about 20 years

9375.319 --> 9380.039999999999
ago more

9376.68 --> 9384.439
even from 17 on I really tried to become

9380.04 --> 9386.52
part of it I really really tried it just

9384.439 --> 9389.76
didn't work and like I couldn't make it

9386.52 --> 9392.0
work like even like following revers

9389.76 --> 9395.56
World principles of

9392.0 --> 9399.52
like controlling opposition and

9395.56 --> 9403.359
like just the whole way they do things I

9399.52 --> 9406.560000000001
tried it but every every outcome would

9403.359 --> 9409.08
lead to that Beast system no matter how

9406.56 --> 9411.68
much I did for it would tear me down and

9409.08 --> 9414.56
strip my faculties that made me unique

9411.68 --> 9419.52
from me because the Beast system does

9414.56 --> 9424.84
not care about having capable talented

9419.52 --> 9427.84
people within it it only cares for basic

9424.84 --> 9430.359
control and it will strip all your

9427.84 --> 9432.16
faculties from you no matter how useful

9430.359 --> 9434.68
those faculties are no matter how

9432.16 --> 9436.92
practical or how profitable or how

9434.68 --> 9439.319
respected they are they will all be

9436.92 --> 9442.399
stripped from you if you become part of

9439.319 --> 9443.519999999999
the Beast system I tried it I couldn't

9442.399 --> 9447.519999999999
do

9443.52 --> 9449.2
it I really tried I I mean I was at the

9447.52 --> 9451.24
point where I'm like yeah I'll do

9449.2 --> 9453.640000000001
anything I'll freaking kill somebody if

9451.24 --> 9456.359
necessary just for the freaking Beast

9453.64 --> 9459.76
system like I was like really desperate

9456.359 --> 9459.76
to like I just want

9459.88 --> 9469.0
to be able to manifest I just want to be

9464.52 --> 9472.319000000001
successful I couldn't do it like it God

9469.0 --> 9475.6
literally from within stopped

9472.319 --> 9478.84
me it's like my subconscious stopped my

9475.6 --> 9482.24
conscious like I wanted I was desperate

9478.84 --> 9485.8
it couldn't work it didn't

9482.24 --> 9488.96
work I just caught on like no they're

9485.8 --> 9492.0
not going to allow me to have that power

9488.96 --> 9495.278999999999
that I that uses intellect and insight

9492.0 --> 9496.68
into truth like they don't allow you to

9495.279 --> 9499.399000000001
have it

9496.68 --> 9501.92
I figured that out very early like I

9499.399 --> 9505.039999999999
felt it about people that everybody just

9501.92 --> 9507.279
wanted me to be [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] they

9505.04 --> 9508.960000000001
would have all accepted me better if I

9507.279 --> 9511.800000000001
were just

9508.96 --> 9513.8
[Â __Â ] like some of these people and

9511.8 --> 9515.519999999999
back then I was kind of T telepathic

9513.8 --> 9517.399
like we're literally thinking if this

9515.52 --> 9520.0
guy would only just get some kind of

9517.399 --> 9522.358999999999
accident he'd be a complete [Â __Â ] and

9520.0 --> 9524.72
he'd be our champion yeah all I'd had to

9522.359 --> 9526.68
do is freaking have a labotomy and I

9524.72 --> 9528.24
would be their champion

9526.68 --> 9530.64
now

9528.24 --> 9533.96
literally if I had done that I'd be

9530.64 --> 9535.358999999999
their Champion now you'd see me speaking

9533.96 --> 9538.56
kind of like a

9535.359 --> 9541.800000000001
[Â __Â ] like on television being a

9538.56 --> 9544.6
politician telling you to eat the bug I

9541.8 --> 9546.278999999999
would have been that guy and I can't I

9544.6 --> 9549.04
couldn't because the only way I could

9546.279 --> 9550.76
have done that if is if I would have had

9549.04 --> 9554.640000000001
a labotomy

9550.76 --> 9557.64
it's not an exaggeration it's not a

9554.64 --> 9557.64
joke

9558.8 --> 9563.519999999999
it was I couldn't do it I couldn't make

9561.72 --> 9566.319
the sacrifice of everything that was

9563.52 --> 9568.52
good about me I couldn't do it I was

9566.319 --> 9571.96
physically incapable of doing it even

9568.52 --> 9573.6
though I thought I willed it it couldn't

9571.96 --> 9578.0
do

9573.6 --> 9581.12
it and so the other alternative is well

9578.0 --> 9583.2
then maybe I'll just freaking turn the

9581.12 --> 9586.08
entire Beast system inside out and

9583.2 --> 9587.479000000001
exterminate everything that's in there

9586.08 --> 9590.08
so that was the

9587.479 --> 9592.199999999999
alternative if you don't take me then

9590.08 --> 9595.279
I'll destroy

9592.2 --> 9597.359
you oh what you're just one man how the

9595.279 --> 9601.0
hell would you do that yeah well you

9597.359 --> 9603.2
figure it out huh oh you can't because

9601.0 --> 9605.08
you don't have those faculties because

9603.2 --> 9609.319000000001
you had to sacrifice them to become part

9605.08 --> 9612.84
of the Beast system yeah so you won't

9609.319 --> 9612.84
know how I do

9614.56 --> 9617.56
that

9618.16 --> 9622.119999999999
you're just going to have to be very

9620.08 --> 9625.039999999999
nervous and uncomfortable and [Â __Â ]

9622.12 --> 9628.160000000002
your pants up continually because you

9625.04 --> 9630.800000000001
don't know how I do that you can't

9628.16 --> 9635.359
anticipate me doing

9630.8 --> 9638.24
that yeah I mean am I accomplishing it

9635.359 --> 9641.319
directly with me doing my show that has

9638.24 --> 9644.08
so many has so little views no you can't

9641.319 --> 9646.08
prove that so you literally don't know

9644.08 --> 9648.52
how I'm doing that

9646.08 --> 9648.52
but it's

9660.2 --> 9664.240000000002
happening glad I didn't become a

9668.479 --> 9671.96
hitman that would have

9674.04 --> 9679.92
sucked I mean Hitman are like they've

9677.399 --> 9683.16
been kind of glorified with movies it's

9679.92 --> 9685.56
really sucks you know I mean you never

9683.16 --> 9687.119999999999
get to do a hit on anybody that actually

9685.56 --> 9689.88
deserves it

9687.12 --> 9692.92
ever the only way you make money is if

9689.88 --> 9696.119999999999
you murder people that actually actually

9692.92 --> 9698.56
have value to society that's the only

9696.12 --> 9701.359
way you actually make money as a Hitman

9698.56 --> 9704.439
it's one of the worst Fates you could

9701.359 --> 9707.439
ever have in

9704.439 --> 9707.439
life

9719.92 --> 9727.24
they had to change the pro procedure of

9722.64 --> 9730.0
Lau it's done way many

9727.24 --> 9733.68
ways

9730.0 --> 9737.08
yeah right but my point is is that I I

9733.68 --> 9740.08
couldn't do it

9737.08 --> 9743.399
I couldn't destroy the value that I had

9740.08 --> 9746.039999999999
in order to have a perceived form of

9743.399 --> 9750.64
easy life being part of the B

9746.04 --> 9753.92
system like I couldn't I just it I was

9750.64 --> 9756.84
stopped I was stopped from the

9753.92 --> 9758.52
inside I wanted it I was stopped from

9756.84 --> 9761.279
the

9758.52 --> 9763.439
inside cuz I was just really [Â __Â ]

9761.279 --> 9766.279
sick of this world I was at that point

9763.439 --> 9769.04
where I don't care anymore I just don't

9766.279 --> 9771.12
want to bother I just don't want to care

9769.04 --> 9773.76
anymore like I'll kill everybody I don't

9771.12 --> 9775.92
care anymore well I couldn't it didn't

9773.76 --> 9778.68
matter that I wanted that or that I felt

9775.92 --> 9780.8
like that because it didn't work

9778.68 --> 9783.0
something inside me would stop me it's

9780.8 --> 9785.759999999998
almost like a parent was alongside me

9783.0 --> 9788.2
inside of me that was like yeah you're

9785.76 --> 9790.359
just being a really dumbass spoiled brat

9788.2 --> 9792.720000000001
it's a good thing that me the internal

9790.359 --> 9794.279
parent is there to just prevent you from

9792.72 --> 9796.24
actually doing

9794.279 --> 9798.800000000001
that

9796.24 --> 9801.24
and then weirdly enough I can actually

9798.8 --> 9803.039999999999
feel that and say afterward like yeah

9801.24 --> 9806.039999999999
I'm kind of glad I had that internal

9803.04 --> 9809.240000000002
parent that prevented me from doing that

9806.04 --> 9812.84
that's why I still am a person that kind

9809.24 --> 9816.0
of has a value of some sort instead of

9812.84 --> 9816.0
just being part of the

9823.6 --> 9829.56
problem used to

9826.279 --> 9831.479000000001
alcohol bottom yourself you came back

9829.56 --> 9833.84
with a vengeance yeah it's not really a

9831.479 --> 9835.88
labotomy it's just alcohol supresses I

9833.84 --> 9839.72
mean dude the brain

9835.88 --> 9839.72
regenerates yeah it just

9839.96 --> 9844.88
does that the only place where it said

9842.72 --> 9847.96
that it that oh brain damage is

9844.88 --> 9852.8
irreversible yeah guess who does

9847.96 --> 9854.8
that doctors with medical models that

9852.8 --> 9856.759999999998
don't make any damn sense and aren't

9854.8 --> 9859.92
based on practical

9856.76 --> 9862.279
reality yeah so yeah what do you mean

9859.92 --> 9864.8
brain damage brain

9862.279 --> 9866.16
regenerates besides the brain is

9864.8 --> 9869.759999999998
basically

9866.16 --> 9871.76
like a registry system there is no

9869.76 --> 9876.279
direct critical function that even

9871.76 --> 9879.319
happens in there it's a side organ

9876.279 --> 9881.800000000001
arguably the brain is like a side

9879.319 --> 9884.08
organ it's not the thing that's doing

9881.8 --> 9884.08
all

9884.16 --> 9887.16
that

9888.96 --> 9891.919999999998
my spirit wouldn't

9891.96 --> 9898.119999999999
break right well alcohol sometimes like

9896.24 --> 9900.6
escaping in any kind of drugs but

9898.12 --> 9904.12
especially alcohol is like it's an

9900.6 --> 9907.16
assault on you and your spirit will

9904.12 --> 9907.160000000002
start to defend

9908.0 --> 9914.2
itself like attacking yourself does wake

9911.279 --> 9917.560000000001
you up does wake up your internal

9914.2 --> 9921.319000000001
systems if you attack yourself like with

9917.56 --> 9921.319
poisoning or getting in

9921.439 --> 9927.319
fights or getting in really strenuous

9925.319 --> 9930.56
social positions where you're like

9927.319 --> 9933.72
isolated and shamed or whatever that

9930.56 --> 9933.72
like that wakes you

9933.88 --> 9939.56
up because you're under attack now your

9936.96 --> 9943.679999999998
spirit has to defend

9939.56 --> 9943.68
itself so that is what it

9944.08 --> 9947.08
does

9951.24 --> 9955.279
there are many ways to dumb yourself

9952.92 --> 9957.68
yeah sure the most of it is temporary

9955.279 --> 9957.68
it's just

9964.96 --> 9971.679999999998
suppression I mean with these disgusting

9969.04 --> 9976.479000000001
cartel liberals New World Order

9971.68 --> 9980.12
antihuman people it's mostly pH itical

9976.479 --> 9983.16
drugs they just have their type of pill

9980.12 --> 9983.160000000002
and that's how they do

9986.84 --> 9991.960000000001
it they like permanently suppress their

9989.68 --> 9995.24
spirit with it so

9991.96 --> 9997.8
that it will function in accordance to

9995.24 --> 10000.92
how they see it from their perspective

9997.8 --> 10004.0
not to how the internal World sees it

10000.92 --> 10007.0
not how the actual Spirit sees

10004.0 --> 10007.0
it

10008.68 --> 10013.84
and that's how they just keep going and

10010.52 --> 10016.52
how they can remain on such a

10013.84 --> 10018.68
deluded point of view and such deluded

10016.52 --> 10022.279
actions for so long and like never

10018.68 --> 10025.359
relenting never figuring it

10022.279 --> 10027.76
out never repenting never

10025.359 --> 10029.720000000001
realizing how [Â __Â ] up it is what

10027.76 --> 10032.359
they're doing and how they shouldn't do

10029.72 --> 10036.64
it how it's not in their own interest

10032.359 --> 10040.279
really to do it they're so far sunk in

10036.64 --> 10040.278999999999
and they just suppress it

10062.16 --> 10067.359
pharmacologically but that was the only

10064.24 --> 10069.72
way I could take PR real

10067.359 --> 10072.6
yeah I mean I had that issue with

10069.72 --> 10074.64
alcohol I I just I've chosen differently

10072.6 --> 10077.56
now I've just chosen to like yeah I'm

10074.64 --> 10080.479
not going to use aloh anymore to adapt

10077.56 --> 10082.8
to how [Â __Â ] people are I'm just not

10080.479 --> 10085.599999999999
going to adapt to people

10082.8 --> 10088.16
anymore they can try to adapt to me I'm

10085.6 --> 10092.12
not adapting

10088.16 --> 10093.8
anymore yeah you're just [Â __Â ] and I

10092.12 --> 10095.399000000001
don't

10093.8 --> 10098.56
care

10095.399 --> 10102.0
and I'm not going to help you out

10098.56 --> 10106.479
enabling you to feel okay about

10102.0 --> 10106.479
it yeah not doing it

10112.56 --> 10116.76
anymore pharmaceutical industry

10114.52 --> 10118.2
destroyed the community you was in yeah

10116.76 --> 10120.960000000001
it destroyed my

10118.2 --> 10122.880000000001
family my mother died arguably because

10120.96 --> 10126.56
of

10122.88 --> 10129.72
it but my mother died the entire family

10126.56 --> 10133.519999999999
like exploded

10129.72 --> 10133.519999999999
apart that was the end of

10150.0 --> 10153.319
it right

10153.72 --> 10156.72
anyhow

10157.08 --> 10161.84
been going for 2 hours 46

10162.88 --> 10170.599999999999
minutes you didn't know oh I've said it

10165.319 --> 10170.6
many times but yeah I mean that all

10170.68 --> 10179.2
happened two decades ago if you believe

10175.52 --> 10180.92
that to me it feels like it's like two

10179.2 --> 10183.720000000001
years ago or something but it is

10180.92 --> 10186.72
literally two decades

10183.72 --> 10186.72
ago

10192.56 --> 10197.84
there's there's a good chance that in a

10194.56 --> 10199.8
way my spirit in a big part will always

10197.84 --> 10201.6
be

10199.8 --> 10203.84
stuck in

10201.6 --> 10206.880000000001
between

10203.84 --> 10210.359
1997 and

10206.88 --> 10213.16
2008 so many things happened during that

10210.359 --> 10216.640000000001
time that it's like I can never forget

10213.16 --> 10216.64
what it was like

10217.439 --> 10224.04
well after that time it's all a bit more

10221.16 --> 10226.68
hazy it's like everything that happened

10224.04 --> 10229.76
after that like it really integrated

10226.68 --> 10231.439
with me how I am now but back then not

10229.76 --> 10235.2
so

10231.439 --> 10236.800000000001
much I was in a way still trying to

10235.2 --> 10238.6
become part of the Beast system it

10236.8 --> 10240.08
wasn't really working I was like yeah

10238.6 --> 10242.08
but what if I just become part of the

10240.08 --> 10243.64
Beast system in opposition to the Beast

10242.08 --> 10246.64
Sy yeah that doesn't

10243.64 --> 10246.64
work

10257.76 --> 10262.800000000001
but I just remember a lot of it like I

10260.64 --> 10265.84
remember what it looked

10262.8 --> 10268.438999999998
like like the the place I was living at

10265.84 --> 10268.439
what it looked

10268.52 --> 10273.16
like my

10270.8 --> 10275.56
cat very

10273.16 --> 10279.72
important that didn't period is pretty

10275.56 --> 10279.72
much the lifespan of my most beloved

10303.56 --> 10306.56
cat

10313.399 --> 10315.64
right

10315.92 --> 10319.72
anyhow it's good to have this

10317.84 --> 10323.72
conversation with you richardy I don't

10319.72 --> 10326.599999999999
mind you filling up the chat like

10323.72 --> 10330.119999999999
that do you think we all experience time

10326.6 --> 10330.12
at a difference

10330.2 --> 10336.84
what great of

10333.0 --> 10339.8
Decay no it's

10336.84 --> 10341.56
just yeah we experience the passage of

10339.8 --> 10342.72
time differently but it all depends on

10341.56 --> 10345.96
our

10342.72 --> 10348.72
Focus there is such a thing as time

10345.96 --> 10351.039999999999
awareness the passing of time awareness

10348.72 --> 10353.599999999999
and then you can have that turn off

10351.04 --> 10356.479000000001
because you're just so bu busy building

10353.6 --> 10359.640000000001
with whatever is happening in your mind

10356.479 --> 10362.278999999999
that you don't keep track of how much

10359.64 --> 10366.0
time passes and then it seems like time

10362.279 --> 10370.12
suddenly went away but it's because your

10366.0 --> 10372.319
time passage sense was too distracted to

10370.12 --> 10376.359
do its

10372.319 --> 10379.199999999999
job you were too focused too in the zone

10376.359 --> 10383.16
and then time sense kind of like turns

10379.2 --> 10383.16
off so that's what that

10384.279 --> 10391.2
is I mean we all experience time linear

10388.6 --> 10392.84
that's how the conscious experiences

10391.2 --> 10395.6
things like even if you're conscious

10392.84 --> 10397.8
like how I was in the Dark World

10395.6 --> 10401.04
bypassing

10397.8 --> 10403.358999999999
time well I still experienced all that

10401.04 --> 10405.84
in a linear fashion like the

10403.359 --> 10407.800000000001
Consciousness experience itself was a

10405.84 --> 10410.04
linear experience your Consciousness

10407.8 --> 10411.88
doesn't split up and goes in both ways

10410.04 --> 10415.04
at the same time or something like that

10411.88 --> 10415.039999999999
no it's

10415.52 --> 10422.960000000001
just you can go anywhere in time but you

10419.439 --> 10424.800000000001
still experience all of it in a linear

10422.96 --> 10426.399
setting because that is the only way our

10424.8 --> 10429.119999999999
conscious

10426.399 --> 10432.76
function and our memory functions it's

10429.12 --> 10435.08
the linear time based experience that is

10432.76 --> 10435.08
our

10435.2 --> 10440.12
conscious I mean the subconscious can go

10437.76 --> 10442.52
in all directions like the subconscious

10440.12 --> 10444.239000000001
doesn't give a [Â __Â ] about time it just

10442.52 --> 10445.92
does what it does it doesn't care about

10444.239 --> 10449.279
cohesion doesn't care about storing

10445.92 --> 10451.72
memories even that's the Consciousness

10449.279 --> 10453.08
that cares about that because that is

10451.72 --> 10455.399
the thing that's going to have to look

10453.08 --> 10458.64
upon that upon everything that's done

10455.399 --> 10462.119999999999
subconsciousness just does things it

10458.64 --> 10466.039999999999
doesn't give a [Â __Â ] about

10462.12 --> 10466.04
time or the passage of

10466.96 --> 10473.919999999998
it this G

10470.68 --> 10477.52
function it was a joke

10473.92 --> 10479.72
glammy referencing to the viral gain of

10477.52 --> 10482.52
function research that's so much talked

10479.72 --> 10485.319
about which is blatantly

10482.52 --> 10488.399000000001
nonsense because virus is don't exist

10485.319 --> 10490.84
literally don't exist they don't have a

10488.399 --> 10494.16
function that can be weaponized because

10490.84 --> 10498.399
they don't exist literally don't

10494.16 --> 10501.6
exist but yeah I mean gain of function

10498.399 --> 10503.88
in the human context is to fight the

10501.6 --> 10507.84
pandemic of uselessness I mean it's

10503.88 --> 10511.399
literally in the title what does it mean

10507.84 --> 10513.2
what it means should be self- clarifying

10511.399 --> 10516.039999999999
in the

10513.2 --> 10520.6
title but maybe it just doesn't work for

10516.04 --> 10520.6
you if you have a lower than adiq

10533.56 --> 10541.16
clamy yeah because gain of function well

10537.68 --> 10544.04
literally to gain a function having a

10541.16 --> 10545.84
function where before there was none

10544.04 --> 10549.04
yeah

10545.84 --> 10551.72
to what fight

10549.04 --> 10553.800000000001
uselessness which is like a pandemic

10551.72 --> 10556.56
right all a play a word I mean how can

10553.8 --> 10558.64
you not see that did you just ask it

10556.56 --> 10561.278999999999
because you thought oh this might be a

10558.64 --> 10564.199999999999
good question to get Arwin talking or is

10561.279 --> 10566.2
that genuinely a question you had clammy

10564.2 --> 10568.279
because if that was genuinely a question

10566.2 --> 10570.560000000001
you had then I have a serious doubts

10568.279 --> 10573.880000000001
about your intelligence

10570.56 --> 10576.76
level so I hope that you just thought

10573.88 --> 10578.92
that was a funny thing to ask to get me

10576.76 --> 10581.16
to talk and not because you actually had

10578.92 --> 10581.16
that

10594.08 --> 10602.479
question okay so worrisome it is

10599.92 --> 10606.64
then I'm sure I'm a great teacher I'm

10602.479 --> 10606.64
actually kind of a hard teacher I'm very

10611.239 --> 10615.479
harsh but harsh teachers do actually

10614.12 --> 10619.640000000001
make the best

10615.479 --> 10619.64
teachers for a whole range of

10623.2 --> 10628.76
people all

10625.76 --> 10631.68
right I'll try to be less har on your

10628.76 --> 10635.439
next time clammy just don't ask any more

10631.68 --> 10640.08
damn details about my private going

10635.439 --> 10640.08
about I really don't want you to do that

10644.96 --> 10648.199999999999
again all

10660.6 --> 10666.0
right jeez this is ever G to do it

10669.76 --> 10672.76
nothing

10673.84 --> 10678.279
oh G to do anything at

10689.8 --> 10695.92
all man this video downloader thing is

10693.359 --> 10695.92
so

10697.239 --> 10703.239
annoying it's like terrible it just

10700.319 --> 10705.6
won't work normally and it like

10703.239 --> 10709.119999999999
completely overdrives my computer every

10705.6 --> 10712.08
time I use this like a a freaking video

10709.12 --> 10716.800000000001
downloading a video from YouTube should

10712.08 --> 10720.479
not take an hour of like your computer

10716.8 --> 10725.92
blasting with activity that's [Â __Â ]

10720.479 --> 10725.92
that's like intolerably stupid

10726.04 --> 10730.68
I don't understand why it's so much

10728.84 --> 10733.319
[Â __Â ] effort downloading a YouTube

10730.68 --> 10733.319
video it's

10734.68 --> 10740.960000000001
ridiculous I already had the title ready

10783.12 --> 10786.76
back on them with everything that's been

10784.88 --> 10788.88
learned it's like funny how it just

10786.76 --> 10792.84
works out and how there have not been

10788.88 --> 10795.119999999999

10801.52 --> 10807.239
knew they were wrong even though I did

10804.359 --> 10809.880000000001
