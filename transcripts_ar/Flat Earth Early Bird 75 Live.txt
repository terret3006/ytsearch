3.2 --> 10.32
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

7.29 --> 14.780000000000001
burden um here 75 your host

10.32 --> 17.85
Arwen I'm starting a little early

14.78 --> 20.66
because I got an appointment to get my

17.85 --> 23.609
driver's license renewed

20.66 --> 26.759999999999998
so yeah the only time available was like

23.609 --> 29.429000000000002
right at 3 o'clock so I can't

26.76 --> 32.579
unfortunately teleport right from here

29.429 --> 35.43
to the place where I need to be for that

32.579 --> 41.82
so I have to make some time to get there

35.43 --> 46.14
and I have to get ya through bit on a

41.82 --> 49.02
bicycle so well I've already been out

46.14 --> 51.27
for groceries and it's not that bad but

49.02 --> 57.17
you have to be careful here and there in

51.27 --> 61.190000000000005
the corner any weight mm-hmm hello guys

57.17 --> 61.19
hello called expose

62.4 --> 69.56
-

64.019 --> 73.369
I've dude seriously get life Steve

69.56 --> 73.369
Voynich hello guys

76.689 --> 82.44999999999999
so

78.71 --> 85.96
been looking around I was a slightly

82.45 --> 85.96000000000001
disappointed to see

91.99 --> 97.91
so stupid of me forget ism yeah Owen

94.7 --> 101.06
Benjamin well and apparently he's now

97.91 --> 104.21
turned his channel into a membership

101.06 --> 107.06
only thing so you can't comment any more

104.21 --> 109.08999999999999
you have to pay five bucks a month to do

107.06 --> 115.64
that was ten or something

109.09 --> 120.32000000000001
yes well be assured that I don't plan to

115.64 --> 123.2
monetize things like that unless it

120.32 --> 127.19
becomes the absolute overall default and

123.2 --> 129.38
everyone everyone does it but I hope it

127.19 --> 133.07
won't because it does yeah again it's

129.38 --> 134.84
now it's turning almost the same by

133.07 --> 136.94
doing this you're turning it almost the

134.84 --> 138.86
same as what's happening to the computer

136.94 --> 141.65
games like oh yeah it's for free

138.86 --> 148.79000000000002
but if you want to play you gotta pay

141.65 --> 153.41
and that's not nice that again we're

148.79 --> 158.239
given the a handout for absolute freedom

153.41 --> 160.1
of everything and then certainly like

158.239 --> 161.87
yeah now you're not getting in that

160.1 --> 165.22
anymore and now you got to pay for it

161.87 --> 165.22
it's just

166.95 --> 171.86999999999998
that's communication slavery in my

169.62 --> 174.09
opinion I don't like that at all I like

171.87 --> 176.42000000000002
this whole thing about being able to

174.09 --> 178.83
just fund each other

176.42 --> 182.73
voluntarily and everything but I don't

178.83 --> 189.20000000000002
like yeah if you want to participate you

182.73 --> 193.26
gotta pay at least for you to you know

189.2 --> 196.22
but I guess some other people think

193.26 --> 196.22
differently about that

211.25 --> 215.72
all right Antonia sue Moretz

217.81 --> 224.46
it's like the trolls here and stuff

224.98 --> 235.51
hello the red path cute

229.659 --> 235.51
drea browning good to see you

237.23 --> 244.76
yeah again I've got Aryans on my mind

241.459 --> 247.3
although at this point I feel like even

244.76 --> 251.47
calling them tart Aryans almost seems

247.3 --> 255.67000000000002
incorrect would be a temporary cultural

251.47 --> 255.67
interpretation I don't know

258.06 --> 263.76
I don't know even just thinking about

261.0 --> 266.88
trying to think from their perspective

263.76 --> 269.4
like didn't I even have a name they're

266.88 --> 272.79
people that they even call themselves

269.4 --> 275.52
anything or were they just what they are

272.79 --> 279.0
and they didn't care really about that

275.52 --> 281.29999999999995
kind of identity stuff in a position to

279.0 --> 281.3
others

282.66 --> 291.93
but anyhow you know just thinking about

285.84 --> 295.16999999999996
it it is it is kind of weird because I'm

291.93 --> 297.36
just trying to puzzle it like what

295.17 --> 298.28000000000003
happened with those people and what

297.36 --> 303.14
happened

298.28 --> 307.10999999999996
here in Europe and it's so crazy to me

303.14 --> 310.59
because yeah I've never been in that

307.11 --> 313.38
time really but I'm getting visions

310.59 --> 315.92999999999995
relating to this stuff or I have had

313.38 --> 318.6
them in the past not at that I'm not

315.93 --> 323.79
even sure if they were real but yeah the

318.6 --> 326.13
contacts that was real you know you can

323.79 --> 330.42
feel it when you are in contact with

326.13 --> 334.92
another actual being and you can feel

330.42 --> 336.51
how they are that was real but now in my

334.92 --> 339.27000000000004
head I'm just trying to personal like

336.51 --> 341.57
you know what happened and the more I

339.27 --> 345.74
think about it more it crystallizes like

341.57 --> 350.25
well yeah almost like an incredible

345.74 --> 354.32
fantasy story so it's almost like the

350.25 --> 354.32
Dark Crystal or something

354.77 --> 361.25
like the two opposing forces or

358.25 --> 363.44
principles or methodologies just

361.25 --> 366.259
naturally clashing with each other and

363.44 --> 371.259
how they all respond and the long-term

366.259 --> 371.259
consequences and it is quite surreal and

373.12 --> 383.83
heavy and scary all these things and and

379.12 --> 387.8
it feels really like a mythology really

383.83 --> 392.599
so I'm just wondering like is this what

387.8 --> 396.71000000000004
is this is this really just a story is

392.599 --> 399.289
this their story the story that these

396.71 --> 402.43
people which I do actually think have

399.289 --> 408.259
existed is that the story that they made

402.43 --> 412.58
from the other side because the more I

408.259 --> 416.05
think about it the more it is yeah they

412.58 --> 416.05
split up it's like

418.1 --> 425.81
but the toydarians at first they were

421.61 --> 431.36
like a peaceful frolic a people silly

425.81 --> 433.85
and weird and they used like magic but

431.36 --> 436.13
in in a very light way and I am just

433.85 --> 439.13
absolutely convinced of this in death

436.13 --> 441.89
every time I think I hear some

439.13 --> 446.9
Christians screaming heretic your girl

441.89 --> 451.13
would devil and I'm just no no that's

446.9 --> 453.73999999999995
not what they were absolutely not the

451.13 --> 455.03
darkness came after they were freaking

453.74 --> 460.91
getting genocided

455.03 --> 465.2
that's when the when the gentle ones

460.91 --> 468.14000000000004
were all killed and ascended through the

465.2 --> 471.34999999999997
path in peace the others did they went

468.14 --> 474.01
mad and they were the ones that started

471.35 --> 476.96000000000004
entering the darkness and it's

474.01 --> 479.3
apparently springs forth the concept of

476.96 --> 482.45
the Dark Elves and I'm now thinking like

479.3 --> 486.17
yeah darkness what does darkness do how

482.45 --> 488.27
does it work and it destroys so it's

486.17 --> 492.47
very likely that they went into the

488.27 --> 494.35999999999996
darkness purely to seek revenge revenge

492.47 --> 499.76000000000005
for the death of their people and they

494.36 --> 502.43
may be the the dark spirits that were

499.76 --> 505.75
remnants of them for whatever they did

502.43 --> 505.75
maybe part of

507.49 --> 515.21
did I tough to say but they may be part

511.82 --> 519.7
of the demons that hunt humanity right

515.21 --> 523.19
now to say that they are the cause

519.7 --> 527.87
something else but they feel like they

523.19 --> 531.7
played a part in that like a curse on

527.87 --> 533.9
humanity for what humanity has done

531.7 --> 536.2700000000001
unnecessarily because they didn't need

533.9 --> 540.62
to and I think that probably even in the

536.27 --> 544.52
first in the first unleashing of the

540.62 --> 546.38
genocide 'ok the genocide on the

544.52 --> 549.8299999999999
toydarians that the tert Aryans

546.38 --> 553.28
basically just talked their would-be

549.83 --> 556.76
murderers out of it like no we're never

553.28 --> 558.8299999999999
gonna hurt you and all we want you like

556.76 --> 561.56
if you need something we'll give it to

558.83 --> 566.0300000000001
you and we'll just find another place

561.56 --> 569.54
like super ultra ultra ultra gentle and

566.03 --> 573.11
the humans just couldn't couldn't do it

569.54 --> 578.9599999999999
they couldn't get it they couldn't they

573.11 --> 583.13
couldn't do it so it's likely that yeah

578.96 --> 587.72
in like a very harsh darkness they were

583.13 --> 590.87
and just pushed harder whipped by the

587.72 --> 595.58
Masters harder to do it or even break

590.87 --> 598.9
their minds to do it like think of it

595.58 --> 602.12
like a medieval MKULTRA just like no you

598.9 --> 604.04
you're nothing the only thing you are is

602.12 --> 606.29
that which is going to destroy

604.04 --> 609.3199999999999
people that kind of [ __ ] maybe that

606.29 --> 614.079
happened eventually but there's just so

609.32 --> 618.5
much that transpired before that I feel

614.079 --> 624.37
and it's almost like I could draw it

618.5 --> 627.38
like in a story fashion how these seams

624.37 --> 630.22
transpired one after another and really

627.38 --> 637.91
tell the story again whether this be

630.22 --> 641.86
real or a weird mythology that has just

637.91 --> 641.86
a story to tell I don't know what it is

645.24 --> 649.009
but it is fascinating

649.03 --> 657.76
and the more I think about it and the

652.12 --> 660.13
funny thing was is that even as a young

657.76 --> 664.86
kid when I couldn't handle the emotional

660.13 --> 669.58
weight of all of this stuff even then I

664.86 --> 675.28
just thought you're fools what have you

669.58 --> 678.94
done to yourself like you've let naivety

675.28 --> 681.76
destroy yourselves and then the

678.94 --> 685.1800000000001
counterpart you let yeah you'd let

681.76 --> 686.02
yourself be driven driven mad beyond

685.18 --> 690.43
redemption

686.02 --> 692.35
so what is the point of this and how can

690.43 --> 695.9799999999999
you ensure that this doesn't happen

692.35 --> 698.44
again because yeah territory ins or

695.98 --> 700.57
whatever they're called I am pretty damn

698.44 --> 704.3100000000001
certain that they have mingled with

700.57 --> 707.38
humanity for some time before the

704.31 --> 709.81
original peoples were just exterminated

707.38 --> 711.76
or even after as I said it's very likely

709.81 --> 715.18
that they just couldn't kill all these

711.76 --> 716.95
women that were just too amazing so they

715.18 --> 720.31
just took him with them ins like okay

716.95 --> 723.3100000000001
these are now maybe they it's very

720.31 --> 726.4
likely the royalty whatever that

723.31 --> 732.13
actually was at the start interbred with

726.4 --> 734.68
them and the Tartarian remnants became

732.13 --> 737.65
part of the bloodline that was so

734.68 --> 740.4399999999999
special and maybe again the source of

737.65 --> 744.18
the curse of their evil corruption curse

740.44 --> 747.82
and their madness that's now boiling up

744.18 --> 750.2199999999999
more than ever more visible than ever it

747.82 --> 753.5400000000001
is maybe because they've intermingled

750.22 --> 753.5400000000001
with heat art Aryans and

755.199 --> 763.579
there are ancestral spirits that curse

759.41 --> 766.639
them so it's very bizarre how that works

763.579 --> 768.4699999999999
at first although one party the Tarte

766.639 --> 772.4590000000001
Aryans all they want is peace the other

768.47 --> 774.47
one no they kill them destroy them so

772.459 --> 775.9989999999999
that's like okay what's left now where

774.47 --> 779.48
we are in control

775.999 --> 781.97
we will mingle with you and then the

779.48 --> 783.739
other say okay that's fine but we will

781.97 --> 786.739
never forget what you do and we're

783.739 --> 791.48
actually cursing you from the inside now

786.739 --> 795.379
I think something is crazy is that

791.48 --> 799.009
and yeah it's must be must must be like

795.379 --> 803.779
an archaic ancient spiritual battle

799.009 --> 807.939
between these spiritual factions and I

803.779 --> 814.129
think that many things sprung from this

807.939 --> 817.3389999999999
so said I am more convinced that like

814.129 --> 819.489
even the the early Nazis or the thule

817.339 --> 822.009
society that kind of thing had

819.489 --> 825.919
involvements with this knowledge and

822.009 --> 830.179
maybe some goal like bringing them back

825.919 --> 833.449
where maybe they it's hard to tell but

830.179 --> 835.579
yeah again it did every time this and

833.449 --> 838.91
this seems logical every time somebody

835.579 --> 841.819
would discover this discovered the

838.91 --> 844.66
ancients discovered the tert Aryans that

841.819 --> 844.66
they existed

844.77 --> 853.05
if you deal with them you will deal as a

850.22 --> 855.6600000000001
human and basically there's now only

853.05 --> 857.9399999999999
humans left view there maybe turian in

855.66 --> 860.85
us but they are basically only humans

857.94 --> 862.83
left and these tart Aryans yeah they

860.85 --> 866.22
just have the light and the dark Sider

862.83 --> 870.089
and you can't take the light side

866.22 --> 875.4200000000001
without also dealing with that dark side

870.089 --> 875.4200000000001
and this is the biggest thing about

875.899 --> 884.73
involving magically spiritual with these

880.23 --> 890.37
people it is the greatest danger of it

884.73 --> 892.83
and also probably the thing again that

890.37 --> 898.17
the controller's fear the loss of

892.83 --> 901.2900000000001
control and yeah if these if the darker

898.17 --> 905.5799999999999
side of the Tartarian scan I can imagine

901.29 --> 910.459
be incredibly creatively destructive in

905.58 --> 910.4590000000001
a very smart way what

914.86 --> 919.47
I don't know I'm still kind of

919.84 --> 926.65
feeling in the dark a bit it does feel

923.8 --> 928.9499999999999
so similar to like what the hell is

926.65 --> 933.34
going on with the left right I feel so

928.95 --> 937.8000000000001
similar but my god what happened did

933.34 --> 940.8000000000001
they get this curse can it be undone

937.8 --> 940.8
somehow

945.98 --> 952.33
what is this

948.5 --> 952.33
you know it's

952.99 --> 960.99
if you think about it the madness that

957.18 --> 965.9399999999999
that the Marxist left and everyone is

960.99 --> 970.45
showing it doesn't seem very controlling

965.94 --> 974.0200000000001
you know because in the process of this

970.45 --> 977.11
destruction they are losing control so

974.02 --> 981.66
maybe it is like the dark side of the

977.11 --> 987.37
tart Ariens doing that breaking it down

981.66 --> 989.41
why why would they do this they do this

987.37 --> 992.35
because the left was on the verge of

989.41 --> 994.3
pasting basically opening up and trying

992.35 --> 997.27
to heal the spiritual realm

994.3 --> 999.43
maybe they bumped the the higher ranks

997.27 --> 1001.92
bumped into the nicer tart Aryans and

999.43 --> 1005.0999999999999
then the Dark One's started to involve

1001.92 --> 1009.87
themselves they ruined it the other side

1005.1 --> 1012.95
ruined it or maybe this is just some

1009.87 --> 1012.95
last challenge

1014.43 --> 1027.9199999999998
I don't know I'm probably taking this

1016.44 --> 1027.92
way too far so let's see

1028.65 --> 1032.51
the ballers in chat

1039.12 --> 1043.9599999999998
No

1041.18 --> 1043.96
Multi

1046.43 --> 1050.98
all scarred deal back

1056.05 --> 1058.62
yeah

1059.559 --> 1062.559
disgusting

1063.19 --> 1066.15
what the hell dude

1078.56 --> 1083.6
this this talk that I'm having is

1081.23 --> 1086.42
certainly bringing some nasty freakin

1083.6 --> 1088.99
habits out of some people it's really

1086.42 --> 1088.99
telling

1094.28 --> 1102.83
you know and for me

1097.76 --> 1106.66
every time the further I dig deeper in

1102.83 --> 1112.6599999999999
when I cover it up in my mind the more

1106.66 --> 1112.66
freaky the world starts to respond like

1112.84 --> 1118.34
remember I told you from the other side

1115.28 --> 1120.44
that I thought yeah that I felt like

1118.34 --> 1123.1699999999998
that they were trying to make me kill

1120.44 --> 1128.3600000000001
myself that kind of thing that this is

1123.17 --> 1133.22
almost an obsession to them well like

1128.36 --> 1136.52
this stuff manifests further then I

1133.22 --> 1139.16
sometimes want to believe because it's

1136.52 --> 1142.58
almost like I walked into some place and

1139.16 --> 1145.01
then suddenly I don't know where a song

1142.58 --> 1146.81
place that I've never heard before I

1145.01 --> 1149.54
don't remember it may even be an old

1146.81 --> 1151.8799999999999
song and that freaking song just talks

1149.54 --> 1156.05
about wanting to end it that kind of

1151.88 --> 1160.97
[ __ ] it's like why why did that one

1156.05 --> 1165.59
freaking song come on when I walked in

1160.97 --> 1167.6000000000001
what the hell you know it really feels

1165.59 --> 1170.4199999999998
like the dark forces are gathering

1167.6 --> 1173.84
around me and just thickening the shadow

1170.42 --> 1179.26
and trying to brag with the control that

1173.84 --> 1182.1999999999998
they have but

1179.26 --> 1187.5
is it the controllers or is it the dark

1182.2 --> 1190.99
ones is it the corrupt authoritarians

1187.5 --> 1195.85
their spirits because I don't know are

1190.99 --> 1200.169
they the same are they the same are the

1195.85 --> 1203.5
dark tight Aryans have they actually

1200.169 --> 1208.8700000000001
become the controllers that destroy

1203.5 --> 1212.41
everything it could be I can't freaking

1208.87 --> 1216.2199999999998
exclude that and it's terrifying

1212.41 --> 1221.3400000000001
realization and it is also very young

1216.22 --> 1221.34
and young damn well so you know

1229.39 --> 1235.679
all I know is that

1232.5 --> 1241.53
I don't want this darkness I had a

1235.679 --> 1245.8200000000002
slight slight taste of it and I've spent

1241.53 --> 1251.299
a great deal of my lifetime purging that

1245.82 --> 1254.1299999999999
slight influence from me because it

1251.299 --> 1257.789
every piece of darkness you take is like

1254.13 --> 1260.49
a curse the curse that blinds you and

1257.789 --> 1263.94
makes you vulnerable to dark influences

1260.49 --> 1266.94
that you will not notice that's that's

1263.94 --> 1269.7
the silly part about it when you're

1266.94 --> 1273.03
cursed by this you will be the darkness

1269.7 --> 1277.26
and you will not care it will not hurt

1273.03 --> 1280.8799999999999
you but it will hurt others that's the

1277.26 --> 1286.799
whole sadistic thing about the darkness

1280.88 --> 1293.46
and I want no part in it I I needed a

1286.799 --> 1297.27
sample to understand it and I've come to

1293.46 --> 1304.81
the very very long term conclusion that

1297.27 --> 1306.42
creation does not need it it doesn't

1304.81 --> 1311.97
yeah

1306.42 --> 1314.93
it may hurry transformation may push

1311.97 --> 1314.93
necessity

1316.19 --> 1321.01
but I think in the totality it is just

1318.41 --> 1321.01
not needed

1321.71 --> 1324.71
structurally

1326.2 --> 1333.1000000000001
and that's not just like a political

1329.499 --> 1336.159
view or it is a spiritual view really

1333.1 --> 1340.059
like it's really not needed like even

1336.159 --> 1342.429
and everything calmed down again we

1340.059 --> 1346.269
think that because something goes away

1342.429 --> 1348.759
that the thing that replaces it the

1346.269 --> 1351.82
light side it can't replace the

1348.759 --> 1353.35
functions that the dark side had but I

1351.82 --> 1356.769
think that's just wrong because I think

1353.35 --> 1360.549
the more we all uniformly move into the

1356.769 --> 1364.269
lights then from that light we move into

1360.549 --> 1369.69
new things spring that could never even

1364.269 --> 1369.69
manifest with the darkness present there

1375.57 --> 1383.99
yeah well Darkstar

1379.47 --> 1389.3700000000001
I am starting to disagree with that and

1383.99 --> 1395.07
maybe that be my naive tartarean young

1389.37 --> 1402.6299999999999
nature I believe that when I was a

1395.07 --> 1408.0
little kid and after having sampling I

1402.63 --> 1413.25
just think no no you don't need it

1408.0 --> 1415.92
because think about it like this what is

1413.25 --> 1419.79
the only thing the light needs from the

1415.92 --> 1423.0900000000001
darkness to understand it so what is the

1419.79 --> 1427.26
danger when there is no darkness present

1423.09 --> 1429.81
to learn from well it is forgetting but

1427.26 --> 1432.96
if you move into the light you clear up

1429.81 --> 1435.96
so you can see further and deeper and

1432.96 --> 1440.13
understand better and there was darkness

1435.96 --> 1443.6000000000001
in this world it has been here now it's

1440.13 --> 1443.6000000000001
even here right now so

1446.2 --> 1452.8790000000001
from within the light all you have to do

1448.539 --> 1456.119
is to look back and touch it and feel it

1452.879 --> 1456.119
like I have

1457.56 --> 1464.55
and you can do that from the light to

1461.16 --> 1467.76
remember the darkness and to value the

1464.55 --> 1471.27
light that you carry it's only when all

1467.76 --> 1475.44
memory of darkness all of it is

1471.27 --> 1480.56
completely gone away that the true

1475.44 --> 1483.56
arrogance starts yet from within amnesia

1480.56 --> 1483.56
darkness

1484.26 --> 1489.84
boils up from from beneath and that's

1489.059 --> 1493.85
how it works

1489.84 --> 1493.85
so remembering

1496.86 --> 1501.56
that's what it's about I think it can be

1498.9 --> 1501.5600000000002
done anyway

1509.53 --> 1515.94
I am open to guests although yeah the

1512.53 --> 1519.8799999999999
time is short guys I'm thinking of

1515.94 --> 1525.4
basically stopping this hangout in

1519.88 --> 1528.19
roughly half an hour and I depending on

1525.4 --> 1531.27
my mood and everything I might do

1528.19 --> 1531.27
another early bird

1534.25 --> 1542.529
somewhere yeah few hours after that or

1538.24 --> 1547.23
maybe not I don't know right and you

1542.529 --> 1551.62
didn't write a book yeah so many books I

1547.23 --> 1557.49
could make like a star a rough story out

1551.62 --> 1561.61
of it but it would be designed it would

1557.49 --> 1565.029
not it would be a mythology it would

1561.61 --> 1567.4599999999998
literally be mythology maybe based in

1565.029 --> 1571.6
reality but it would be mythology and

1567.46 --> 1574.3890000000001
again even within that dark world

1571.6 --> 1580.539
connection thing with the territory ins

1574.389 --> 1585.279
themselves I I came very close to the

1580.539 --> 1588.36
shaman and asked him this creation story

1585.279 --> 1593.559
that you have that is so unbelievable

1588.36 --> 1598.5089999999998
how do you know that that is real is it

1593.559 --> 1601.47
real or is it made up and he had no

1598.509 --> 1601.47
answer to it

1604.75 --> 1610.99
so yeah I may write a story about the

1608.23 --> 1615.3700000000001
tight Aryans and how I think that that

1610.99 --> 1616.919
happened that is no confirmation that is

1615.37 --> 1620.26
actually real

1616.919 --> 1624.3300000000002
the only real confirmation that we can

1620.26 --> 1629.169
find is actually find tartarean remnants

1624.33 --> 1631.6789999999999
which may be among the Giants or other

1629.169 --> 1635.5200000000002
weird

1631.679 --> 1638.74
apparently he's slightly malformed

1635.52 --> 1640.33
humanoids because they they were some of

1638.74 --> 1643.409
them were really weird like the tert

1640.33 --> 1646.809
Aryans weren't a very uniform species

1643.409 --> 1649.63
they had like weird shape heads some

1646.809 --> 1656.8
different sizes apparently all over the

1649.63 --> 1659.2
place so yeah

1656.8 --> 1663.78
the only way it's gonna work is to learn

1659.2 --> 1663.78
what they are

1665.15 --> 1672.0500000000002
and just puzzle it together step by step

1668.66 --> 1674.69
what really happened find all the all

1672.05 --> 1677.69
the history that was removed the stories

1674.69 --> 1680.8700000000001
that people have kept locked in their

1677.69 --> 1684.1100000000001
basement in fear of persecution it's

1680.87 --> 1686.6599999999999
like oh yeah maybe one day one day this

1684.11 --> 1689.2099999999998
can be maybe that's almost like how

1686.66 --> 1691.6100000000001
Martin littke is getting his books it's

1689.21 --> 1695.1200000000001
just all these people that the time can

1691.61 --> 1697.6899999999998
we finally can we finally put this out

1695.12 --> 1697.6899999999998
in the world

1707.54 --> 1711.22
crazy bastard once your feet

1715.13 --> 1722.66
anyway I'm gonna

1718.8 --> 1722.6599999999999
put the link out for the panel

1745.84 --> 1758.23
but anyway guys I hope that everything I

1753.37 --> 1760.54
share here is not misconstrued you know

1758.23 --> 1763.93
I hope that you really do feel that I'm

1760.54 --> 1771.07
not trying to fool you this this is

1763.93 --> 1772.93
genuinely springing up here and I'm not

1771.07 --> 1775.48
certain about the things and I share

1772.93 --> 1779.1100000000001
this like every time I am son uncertain

1775.48 --> 1784.9
about something I share it because I

1779.11 --> 1787.06
think they're bad like it is the

1784.9 --> 1794.4
questions that nobody has ever thought

1787.06 --> 1797.94
about asking that is something that is

1794.4 --> 1801.0700000000002
what I'm doing here that's what I'm

1797.94 --> 1805.21
apparently here it feels like yeah I

1801.07 --> 1806.74
need to like uncover those last those

1805.21 --> 1812.91
last things that everybody just thought

1806.74 --> 1812.91
no no no I need to uncover these things

1814.48 --> 1821.1100000000001
try to muster and forge all the wisdom

1817.84 --> 1826.6499999999999
in the world in dealing with that trying

1821.11 --> 1826.6499999999999
to make sense of it for a wider creation

1832.53 --> 1839.73
right but yes and this is also something

1837.33 --> 1842.6999999999998
we have to reconcile there are some

1839.73 --> 1846.5
really weird and freaky things about the

1842.7 --> 1846.5
turians because

1850.63 --> 1853.2890000000002
in there

1854.53 --> 1862.75
Martin littke I think he shared it too

1856.72 --> 1866.8500000000001
that they eat their dead doesn't mean

1862.75 --> 1870.549
that they kill and then they don't

1866.85 --> 1871.7199999999998
cannibalize like killing a people and

1870.549 --> 1874.72
then eating them

1871.72 --> 1879.13
that's not the tert Aryan way what I

1874.72 --> 1887.22
think that they did was on a cellular

1879.13 --> 1889.69
level do like a spirit transfer process

1887.22 --> 1893.83
never seen them actually near organs

1889.69 --> 1895.63
before that wasn't in pictures I've only

1893.83 --> 1898.57
seen these things from pictures like

1895.63 --> 1901.0590000000002
poof I thank God they didn't show me

1898.57 --> 1902.9189999999999
that creepy [ __ ] as a kid in the dark

1901.059 --> 1905.98
world I would have freaked out like

1902.919 --> 1909.789
nothing although the funny thing was I

1905.98 --> 1911.98
actually like I heard them talking in

1909.789 --> 1922.539
the distance maybe we should not talk

1911.98 --> 1927.73
about this in front of things but yeah I

1922.539 --> 1930.84
think that they did that to basically on

1927.73 --> 1935.049
the other side in the spiritual realm

1930.84 --> 1937.57
take their parents like they wouldn't

1935.049 --> 1941.62
eat the young thing we eat their elder

1937.57 --> 1948.1599999999999
and just integrate the entire wisdom of

1941.62 --> 1955.06
their elders into their being like

1948.16 --> 1957.28
a final tutoring on a cellular level and

1955.06 --> 1961.75
it probably has to do with cell your

1957.28 --> 1965.53
memory and I guess somehow they were

1961.75 --> 1968.2
masters of this and it's it's not a

1965.53 --> 1971.47
human thing I don't think that with

1968.2 --> 1975.5800000000002
regular humans this serves any function

1971.47 --> 1981.43
at all so in my personal opinion I think

1975.58 --> 1984.1599999999999
that that habit was for them really only

1981.43 --> 1986.5
they were apparently designed to be able

1984.16 --> 1988.72
to do that it's never gonna work for

1986.5 --> 1992.95
humans even with our remnants of

1988.72 --> 1997.41
tartarean DNA or whatever I don't think

1992.95 --> 1997.41
that should ever come back or

2002.22 --> 2008.91
I don't know I don't know you know maybe

2006.2 --> 2011.82
maybe this world is crazy enough that

2008.91 --> 2016.73
there are actually Dark One's that are

2011.82 --> 2016.73
attempting this kind of [ __ ] in secret

2019.11 --> 2032.399
to try to salvage the knowledge of their

2023.7 --> 2033.3600000000001
ancestors but I look I'm vegetarian no

2032.399 --> 2038.309
thank you

2033.36 --> 2040.769
I don't remember having ever even know I

2038.309 --> 2042.95
don't think even accidentally I would

2040.769 --> 2046.549
never even tricked into doing that [ __ ]

2042.95 --> 2046.549
no thanks

2055.1 --> 2061.2799999999997
but yeah whatever the tert Aryans did

2058.61 --> 2063.17
with their cannibalism you could call it

2061.28 --> 2066.4700000000003
and I'm talking about the early

2063.17 --> 2069.11
tartarean before the before the

2066.47 --> 2071.81
fracturing because after the fracturing

2069.11 --> 2076.27
they went absolutely ape they were

2071.81 --> 2079.49
monsters and probably like like ate

2076.27 --> 2081.2599999999998
their enemies raw while that were still

2079.49 --> 2083.5099999999998
alive that kind of [ __ ] like the

2081.26 --> 2085.4900000000002
freakier they probably did it like the

2083.51 --> 2087.53
dark tart Aryans were probably the most

2085.49 --> 2090.3199999999997
monstrous creepiest creatures you could

2087.53 --> 2094.28
ever imagine literally from your

2090.32 --> 2097.9700000000003
nightmares the booty man [ __ ] that

2094.28 --> 2101.9
probably was them the dark tart Aryans

2097.97 --> 2105.2599999999998
the avenges ones literally haunting

2101.9 --> 2109.64
humanity from in the dream world and in

2105.26 --> 2112.55
the real world wherever they could but

2109.64 --> 2115.49
no the light did the territories before

2112.55 --> 2119.15
that no there's nothing it has nothing

2115.49 --> 2122.2099999999996
to do with with Satanism or suffering

2119.15 --> 2124.58
like trying to master the suffering from

2122.21 --> 2127.7
the innocent that kind of disgusting

2124.58 --> 2131.48
disgusting [ __ ] has nothing to do with

2127.7 --> 2135.83
the ancient ancient archaic Tartarian

2131.48 --> 2140.18
tradition of consuming your deceased

2135.83 --> 2144.86
elders it is nothing like that at anyone

2140.18 --> 2150.14
who associates this is evil and this in

2144.86 --> 2152.51
genuine in my opinion not talking about

2150.14 --> 2155.33
the dark tart Aryans they look they were

2152.51 --> 2158.4500000000003
maniacal beyond the comprehension so

2155.33 --> 2161.99
anything you would accuse them off

2158.45 --> 2165.1
they'll probably happily take it because

2161.99 --> 2165.1
they went that far

2165.4 --> 2171.1
yeah Ober Mukul and the dreamworld look

2169.12 --> 2172.99
the more I think about the dark world

2171.1 --> 2176.08
the more I think that that is actually

2172.99 --> 2180.2099999999996
the dreamworld the collective dreamworld

2176.08 --> 2184.39
the other side and the more I've

2180.21 --> 2186.76
experienced my visions and remembering

2184.39 --> 2188.95
it back and comparing it to things now

2186.76 --> 2191.59
that I'm actually experiencing it in the

2188.95 --> 2198.2799999999997
3d world the more I do definitely think

2191.59 --> 2200.04
that it was all created from within the

2198.28 --> 2203.5
dreamworld

2200.04 --> 2207.69
like a holographic projector within the

2203.5 --> 2213.46
mind that creates everything around you

2207.69 --> 2216.84
with images reflecting from observations

2213.46 --> 2216.84
in the physical world and

2219.19 --> 2221.819
yeah

2225.69 --> 2228.69
move

2230.349 --> 2236.219
it is highly fascinating to me all this

2234.16 --> 2236.219
stuff

2241.3 --> 2250.8700000000003
I know I know flatlander I know the only

2245.8 --> 2254.9500000000003
thing I have is this insight and the

2250.87 --> 2258.2799999999997
feel for it and the need to put down a

2254.95 --> 2260.89
story that makes sense and that gives us

2258.28 --> 2266.44
purpose isn't that actually what

2260.89 --> 2275.0499999999997
mythology was originally for to help us

2266.44 --> 2281.04
provide purpose from within and look I

2275.05 --> 2283.84
think that I got like these tartarean

2281.04 --> 2286.63
encounters in the books from Martin LICO

2283.84 --> 2290.4100000000003
that somebody needs to read all that

2286.63 --> 2294.34
stuff you know I I wanted I want the

2290.41 --> 2296.56
full reports what what in detail do they

2294.34 --> 2299.11
talk about what is it like is it like a

2296.56 --> 2303.91
literary an exploration is it like a

2299.11 --> 2308.4700000000003
scientific report or is it really an

2303.91 --> 2310.6299999999997
inquisition like how could somebody to

2308.47 --> 2314.1699999999996
the best of their abilities translated

2310.63 --> 2318.78
perfectly into modern English somehow it

2314.17 --> 2318.78
might be a colossal task but

2320.869 --> 2329.089
it would help put into context what

2324.92 --> 2332.539
actually happened historically from the

2329.089 --> 2335.119
human's perspective at least and I bet

2332.539 --> 2337.759
you there will be conversations from

2335.119 --> 2339.289
humans with some of the territories and

2337.759 --> 2343.45
the details of what they talked about

2339.289 --> 2347.9
that is also first that is history that

2343.45 --> 2350.1699999999996
that gives hint as to the way they were

2347.9 --> 2353.359
the way they talk the way they think

2350.17 --> 2358.329
another clue very important to figure

2353.359 --> 2358.3289999999997
out the feel the frequency of it

2367.279 --> 2375.45
right okay Aries yeah apparently

2372.089 --> 2377.759
somebody let the darkness in poncho

2375.45 --> 2380.999
pizza I don't know exactly the details

2377.759 --> 2384.319
of what happened but apparently he

2380.999 --> 2388.229
stabbed somebody in fit of rage or

2384.319 --> 2389.94
whatever and he yeah it's in trouble no

2388.229 --> 2392.489
of course with the police and he just

2389.94 --> 2394.259
openly admitted it he probably went nuts

2392.489 --> 2397.44
over something I don't know what

2394.259 --> 2401.039
happened but yeah that happens it's very

2397.44 --> 2405.4500000000003
embarrassing and very stupid and again

2401.039 --> 2408.21
shows that buncha beat is not all there

2405.45 --> 2411.6899999999996
and I don't think he ever was

2408.21 --> 2415.559
I've had few hangouts where I was with

2411.69 --> 2416.2200000000003
him and he was like devilishly allergic

2415.559 --> 2420.119
to Christ

2416.22 --> 2424.14
definitely hated like really really much

2420.119 --> 2427.829
and he was just dwelling and he has been

2424.14 --> 2431.1189999999997
dwelling for a while and now this EEMA

2427.829 --> 2431.119
and yeah

2434.23 --> 2438.46
right perspectives good to say that I

2436.33 --> 2443.17
kind of felt that coming although I

2438.46 --> 2447.03
didn't think you take it this far but

2443.17 --> 2447.03
yeah he does what he does

2472.58 --> 2475.6
it's always nice isn't it

2476.109 --> 2482.38
all the ballot are all gonna you ballers

2479.769 --> 2486.0389999999998
are literally like the Marxist left you

2482.38 --> 2488.619
know it's like oh my god a flat earther

2486.039 --> 2491.619
did something bad and now you're all

2488.619 --> 2497.799
gonna be jacking off to this [ __ ] for

2491.619 --> 2499.989
two weeks probably just murder of course

2497.799 --> 2501.7889999999998
who wouldn't see that coming yeah

2499.989 --> 2505.299
because they're all like this it's only

2501.789 --> 2507.849
a matter of time you're all gonna be

2505.299 --> 2514.299
jacking off to this aren't you you

2507.849 --> 2519.7290000000003
pathetic sexist [ __ ] you are pathetic

2514.299 --> 2524.469
sexist [ __ ] that's gonna just drown in

2519.729 --> 2528.069
this sick little piece of propaganda

2524.469 --> 2530.949
that naturally formed as it happened in

2528.069 --> 2533.319
your minds like that oh my god that the

2530.949 --> 2534.849
one little candle flame against all the

2533.319 --> 2536.709
housekeeping questions that you can

2534.849 --> 2538.2690000000002
never answer with those holes in your

2536.709 --> 2540.969
consciousness and the eternal red

2538.269 --> 2545.14
herrings my god at least you got this

2540.969 --> 2549.16
one guy that went nuts thank God thank

2545.14 --> 2552.16
your God your God allies Satan thank

2549.16 --> 2555.1299999999997

2552.16 --> 2559.439
one guy that went nuts so you have your

2555.13 --> 2564.869
excuse to call us all insane you know

2559.439 --> 2564.8689999999997
people are sick you really are

2579.7 --> 2587.23
noloty silent dance like of conspiracy

2584.74 --> 2590.549
get yeah I would have a first giggle

2587.23 --> 2595.869
moment but then I would be really sad

2590.549 --> 2598.599
cuz I don't want anyone to slash up

2595.869 --> 2606.0
anyone else it's just more darkness

2598.599 --> 2609.099
what's the use of it you know sad what

2606.0 --> 2612.22
what would pressure himself to make him

2609.099 --> 2616.299
break and do that it's just sad

2612.22 --> 2617.95
no I would absolutely not Jews in my

2616.299 --> 2618.819
pants thank you very much you're

2617.95 --> 2622.4199999999996
disgusting

2618.819 --> 2627.7599999999998
sicko leave that to you

2622.42 --> 2630.69
no I don't get off on pain okay I don't

2627.76 --> 2630.69
I hate it

2634.41 --> 2640.5299999999997
and I know trust me okay like I've been

2638.4 --> 2643.2000000000003
in the Gulf and Cena had a few girls

2640.53 --> 2645.3300000000004
here and my ex's little had this weird

2643.2 --> 2649.2799999999997
tendency that she would actually like

2645.33 --> 2652.41
that and I would entertain her with it

2649.28 --> 2658.8900000000003
but I'd be creeped out because I don't

2652.41 --> 2662.67
like pain I don't like pain doesn't make

2658.89 --> 2666.93
me excited at all it's actually just

2662.67 --> 2672.48
doesn't whether it be in me or in the

2666.93 --> 2675.5699999999997
other really I like to screw around

2672.48 --> 2677.87
people that have Luciferian seductions

2675.57 --> 2682.6200000000003
in them like people that are obviously

2677.87 --> 2685.17
like arrogant and being idiots very

2682.62 --> 2689.25
openly I like to [ __ ] around with them

2685.17 --> 2693.17
mentally that that's a thing but that's

2689.25 --> 2695.76
about it that's about the extent of

2693.17 --> 2698.4900000000002
could you even call that darkness it's

2695.76 --> 2703.23
more like nephrology fairy people nature

2698.49 --> 2707.8799999999997
a little chaotic but no I hate darkness

2703.23 --> 2711.33
I I never liked it and the only context

2707.88 --> 2716.2200000000003
I'd ever even considered accepting it is

2711.33 --> 2723.2
as a necessity kind of thing but with

2716.22 --> 2728.14
great pain and regret even so

2723.2 --> 2728.14
no I am NOT of the darkness

2731.28 --> 2734.119
TMI

2738.83 --> 2742.12
guys are just nuts

2752.9 --> 2763.7000000000003
yeah yeah right Ares 106 yeah yeah but

2761.299 --> 2768.529
that's just playing you know this is

2763.7 --> 2771.9199999999996
playing and naughty [ __ ] that's but it's

2768.529 --> 2774.289
really when they can get like yeah I

2771.92 --> 2778.64
want you to hurt me like a self-hatred

2774.289 --> 2781.3590000000004
kind of thing can occur that's when it

2778.64 --> 2781.359
becomes bad

2795.76 --> 2802.4700000000003
I don't get it a gym

2798.42 --> 2805.25
which light are you off the are we

2802.47 --> 2805.25
does that mean

2812.38 --> 2818.1400000000003
oh yeah that's right globe Cole expose I

2815.41 --> 2821.009
don't like the darkness and that's why I

2818.14 --> 2821.009
always wear black

2824.24 --> 2830.1899999999996
that's right

2825.94 --> 2830.19
because I see it differently

2830.52 --> 2834.359
I don't think black is the color of the

2833.19 --> 2837.14
darkness

2834.359 --> 2837.14
really

2838.28 --> 2847.23
as I see it the black only emphasizes

2843.589 --> 2851.849
the spirit everything you'd have all the

2847.23 --> 2855.329
color or thing is you have here it'll

2851.849 --> 2857.76
only distract you while black is just it

2855.329 --> 2860.04
doesn't distract you really you just

2857.76 --> 2863.55
look around it to see what's there so

2860.04 --> 2867.54
because I wear black that just

2863.55 --> 2870.92
emphasizes my spirit and the way I feel

2867.54 --> 2870.92
and Who I am

2872.569 --> 2877.719
so I see it like yeah I wear black

2875.269 --> 2877.7189999999996
because

2878.5 --> 2888.53
I'm like a bright burning piece of coal

2885.21 --> 2888.53
I give off light

2890.36 --> 2896.1800000000003
you know Cole gives off light when you

2893.69 --> 2900.46
burn it yet it is the blackest of the

2896.18 --> 2900.46
black bear is

2902.61 --> 2910.2000000000003
also to the comparison with the ebony

2905.97 --> 2912.16
tree of course the black wood I don't

2910.2 --> 2917.8089999999997
know it's just

2912.16 --> 2922.0989999999997
and it's very convenient okay because if

2917.809 --> 2924.92
you wear white you just have to move or

2922.099 --> 2927.619
like not sit still for an hour and

2924.92 --> 2931.279
you're gonna get freaking stains or dust

2927.619 --> 2934.67
or [ __ ] every single time and black is

2931.279 --> 2938.18
just doesn't have that problem

2934.67 --> 2942.589
gotta get really freaking dirty to get

2938.18 --> 2948.249
stains now I am very careful but it just

2942.589 --> 2948.249
it's just very convenient and I like it

2959.73 --> 2963.589
yeah I'm a piece of coal

2964.609 --> 2971.049
I'm what you got for Christmas not what

2967.249 --> 2971.049
you wanted but it's what you needed

2976.79 --> 2979.45
you

2981.859 --> 2989.68
stop the sick jokes guys it's not funny

2985.989 --> 2993.279
it's not funny that's sociopath okay

2989.68 --> 2999.89
yeah society may allow that right now

2993.279 --> 3003.719
but you shouldn't allow that nay I'm not

2999.89 --> 3003.719
gonna let P Mars and I don't trust him

3011.84 --> 3016.9900000000002
besides I got it round out the show

3013.97 --> 3016.99
because I got to go

3026.21 --> 3029.14
Jesus

3033.539 --> 3039.369
right for anyone watching this video if

3036.4 --> 3041.92
you look at the the chat over there

3039.369 --> 3045.19
they're all going completely nuts and

3041.92 --> 3048.489
creepy and [ __ ] I think it's funny to

3045.19 --> 3054.789
make jokes about stabbing and [ __ ] when

3048.489 --> 3056.92
yeah a guy that is distantly yeah

3054.789 --> 3061.2990000000004
involved with us just really stabbed

3056.92 --> 3063.309
somebody great that's so wrong how can

3061.299 --> 3066.839
you be so sick as to make jokes like

3063.309 --> 3070.299
this it's just it's creepy

3066.839 --> 3072.609
you know I'd want nothing to do with it

3070.299 --> 3074.17
I'm not I'm not really able to block

3072.609 --> 3075.67
your it's probably just gonna get worse

3074.17 --> 3078.489
but that's just sick that's just a

3075.67 --> 3084.2490000000003
darkness inside you amping up the

3078.489 --> 3086.67
darkness I said just think about what

3084.249 --> 3089.41
you're gonna be left with after that

3086.67 --> 3090.7000000000003
it's not gonna be a very rich feeling

3089.41 --> 3095.5789999999997
it's just gonna be hollow

3090.7 --> 3099.6
it's bad joke it's just bad disgusting

3095.579 --> 3101.82
so yeah

3099.6 --> 3109.71
I'm gonna round out the show it's been

3101.82 --> 3112.0800000000004
weird and very Tartarian although I

3109.71 --> 3114.09
don't even know if I'm I probably will

3112.08 --> 3116.67
call them tartarean because it's like

3114.09 --> 3119.76
the one name that doesn't feel all that

3116.67 --> 3128.61
loaded if you say Aryans then

3119.76 --> 3132.65
immediately oh and I don't know we're

3128.61 --> 3138.77
gonna have to figure out a name that is

3132.65 --> 3142.23
correct and yeah we will find it I think

3138.77 --> 3144.21
so yeah I'm gonna have to go otherwise

3142.23 --> 3147.06
I'm gonna be late and gonna be without a

3144.21 --> 3150.23
driver's license unfortunately but I'm

3147.06 --> 3157.16
thinking of coming back after that and

3150.23 --> 3157.16
starting up a second show and I'm not

3162.6 --> 3165.5299999999997
SiC

3170.029 --> 3176.329
yeah I will be back maybe right after

3172.549 --> 3178.249
this or otherwise it's gonna be tomorrow

3176.329 --> 3181.3990000000003
again but I do feel like doing another

3178.249 --> 3184.879

just a little internet so I'm thinking

3238.93 --> 3246.91
of just demonstrating the planned intro

3243.73 --> 3249.43
but without a title card because yeah it

3246.91 --> 3252.45
is sufficient material to make a short

3249.43 --> 3256.0299999999997
intro music and a couple of clips and

3252.45 --> 3258.9399999999996
yeah it's only that title card so maybe

3256.03 --> 3262.42
I'm just gonna let it do that with no

3258.94 --> 3265.9
title card until somebody gets me a

3262.42 --> 3268.39
freaking title card for this maybe I'm

3265.9 --> 3271.69
gonna make it a contest who can make

3268.39 --> 3278.5589999999997
best flat earther early-bird title card

3271.69 --> 3281.29
for the intro so yeah get to work on it

3278.559 --> 3283.3590000000004
if you can if you

3281.29 --> 3286.7
doesn't need to be like the most

3283.359 --> 3289.8199999999997
revolutionary Hollywood blockbuster

3286.7 --> 3292.5499999999997
level intro ever it's just I just need a

3289.82 --> 3296.42
basic title card that's kind of in in a

3292.55 --> 3298.52
good style not too modernized more

3296.42 --> 3302.2400000000002
classical feel to it and it'll be

3298.52 --> 3305.18
alright and then I got my intro complete

3302.24 --> 3308.6499999999996
so I might do that maybe even in this

3305.18 --> 3313.16
follow-up show if I'm gonna do one and

3308.65 --> 3318.6800000000003
yeah I will be back with either flatters

3313.16 --> 3321.71
earlybird number 75 Part B or the number

3318.68 --> 3323.98
76 not sure yet what I'm gonna do

3321.71 --> 3323.98
and

3325.3 --> 3330.34
yeah I always forget this but do share

3328.03 --> 3334.42
the show on any social media you think

3330.34 --> 3339.04
this find a good place should ask that

3334.42 --> 3347.58
more forget it every time anyway yeah

3339.04 --> 3347.58
until the next flat earther leeward flat
