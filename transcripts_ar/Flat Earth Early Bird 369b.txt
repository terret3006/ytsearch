pressure so yeah all those claims

446.58 --> 456.74
earlier from Brenda and whoever it's

451.38 --> 459.36
just yeah doesn't work wait it was the

456.74 --> 467.58
was a Ragnar Stefan hey listen if I

459.36 --> 474.3
remember correctly right yeah more color

467.58 --> 479.43
dude I'm sad to hear that can you do

474.3 --> 482.1
what do you think caused it if if I may

479.43 --> 484.71
inquire I might have I may have some

482.1 --> 487.35
tips if unless you feel like you can

484.71 --> 489.23999999999995
handle in an hour or whatever what do

487.35 --> 491.42
you know why you're feeling that sick

489.24 --> 491.42
today

499.2 --> 506.61
okay in Orthodox it is

523.6 --> 532.51
sickness you think you have a stomach

525.86 --> 532.51
flu some kind but what did you eat

538.74 --> 543.14
or did you eat nothing out of the

541.11 --> 543.14
ordinary

560.01 --> 566.38
nothing under the art here okay so are

563.77 --> 570.8199999999999
you like having a did you have like a

566.38 --> 575.77
very intense or just generally tense

570.82 --> 577.99
week and now like in this weekend you

575.77 --> 581.35
you got the opportunity to finally put

577.99 --> 585.34
that behind you and it's like because

581.35 --> 587.71
that can also tip like switch transition

585.34 --> 590.77
from heavy tension to low tension in the

587.71 --> 595.02
individual can also lead to pretty acute

590.77 --> 595.02
getting sick it's possible

599.22 --> 604.4590000000001
I don't know I'm just spitballing here

601.86 --> 604.4590000000001
at this point

607.52 --> 610.52
yeah

617.98 --> 620.85
hmm

625.16 --> 627.9399999999999
all right

628.15 --> 640.77
well make sure you stay properly

632.38 --> 640.77
hydrated and I don't know

652.02 --> 654.709
all right

662.51 --> 667.22
all right

664.88 --> 670.279
yeah because when you're like really

667.22 --> 672.23
stomach sick staying hydrated is like

670.279 --> 674.0889999999999
the the most import it's the thing you

672.23 --> 678.9490000000001
overlook the most easy because you just

674.089 --> 681.8000000000001
don't wanna but you gotta stay hydrated

678.949 --> 683.93
so important for your for how much

681.8 --> 686.7199999999999
punishment the rest of your organs are

683.93 --> 689.3
going to be receiving alongside of that

686.72 --> 694.6990000000001
so yeah hydration very important if you

689.3 --> 696.889
feel very sick doesn't know the good

694.699 --> 702.1099999999999
servant not even plenty of water just

696.889 --> 706.49
make sure that you that you don't not

702.11 --> 711.62
drink because you feel bad now you could

706.49 --> 713.149
you got it keep the hydration going you

711.62 --> 715.63
don't don't drink a lot of water it

713.149 --> 715.63
doesn't help

724.72 --> 727.95
what else can you do

728.149 --> 732.649
that that's it pretty much I don't

730.62 --> 735.839
usually yeah

732.649 --> 740.31
stomach sickness is not isn't one of the

735.839 --> 742.74
things that I that usually tend to

740.31 --> 745.41
impact me a lot but I rarely get it

742.74 --> 747.72
thank God and I'm so careful with my

745.41 --> 749.9699999999999
food you know these days and I also know

747.72 --> 754.649
like how you typically contract it's

749.97 --> 757.649
like if your weeks if a spot becomes

754.649 --> 759.93
under strain or weakened then sadly if

757.649 --> 764.689
you're not careful with what you eat or

759.93 --> 767.579
E or even a potential non hygienic thing

764.689 --> 770.939
then ya suddenly you can get extremely

767.579 --> 773.189
sick but I've been punished by that kind

770.939 --> 776.279
of thing in the past plenty enough for

773.189 --> 780.3
me to yeah kind of be hypochondriac but

776.279 --> 782.55
not in the pathological sense that I see

780.3 --> 785.25
bacteria every because I don't think

782.55 --> 789.66
about that I'm just hyper hyper careful

785.25 --> 792.029
with how I figured out it really works

789.66 --> 795.149
concerning the cycles of strength and

792.029 --> 797.88
weakness what can be a risk factor and

795.149 --> 801.029
the psychosomatic element that's my

797.88 --> 804.74
hypochondria is kind of been it's not

801.029 --> 809.85
the lose you know it I use it to drive

804.74 --> 812.49
real care for myself and because of the

809.85 --> 815.639
psychosomatic realization as part of it

812.49 --> 817.319
I make sure that I don't grow myself

815.639 --> 819.1800000000001
insane because that is usually the

817.319 --> 822.209
biggest problem with hypochondriacs is

819.18 --> 825.38
that they they go all mental they they

822.209 --> 828.3889999999999
get triggered and then they spiral

825.38 --> 830.459
there's like a neurotic behavior tied

828.389 --> 837.05
into it that's not productive and I've

830.459 --> 837.05
managed to take that and turn it around

839.26 --> 843.01
force it to be effective

847.93 --> 851.0999999999999
[Music]

855.06 --> 859.17
almost never get sick and if I do goes

857.46 --> 862.19
away quicker surprise sex you feel bad

859.17 --> 862.1899999999999
to be honest right

876.36 --> 884.309
I guess that in general if you have to

880.709 --> 886.4699999999999
overgeneralize I guess because yeah I to

884.309 --> 890.069
be fair I don't know really what else I

886.47 --> 892.1700000000001
can give as an advice you know just if

890.069 --> 894.9889999999999
it goes away quick and I hope it does

892.17 --> 896.819
for you then then everything is fine you

894.989 --> 899.61
yeah you know usually what to do after

896.819 --> 901.649
make sure yeah when the sweating starts

899.61 --> 905.069
that face that you do wash it off

901.649 --> 907.499
properly but not too much and get the

905.069 --> 910.6189999999999
vitamin C especially and like chicken

907.499 --> 913.139
broth or so all the things that you know

910.619 --> 913.8290000000001
are part of like the latter cycle of

913.139 --> 916.259
sickness

913.829 --> 919.41
take that that's just my general advice

916.259 --> 921.629
and if it yeah if it keeps on going then

919.41 --> 925.379
it might be a little worse and then you

921.629 --> 928.1990000000001
may want to try something like like CBD

925.379 --> 932.549
oil or something you know might actually

928.199 --> 938.0999999999999
help pretty acutely so but I wouldn't

932.549 --> 942.72
worry too much if it yeah you know when

938.1 --> 946.73
I get sick like that it's super rare it

942.72 --> 946.73
lasts more than 24 hours

952.8 --> 958.9
thank God I'm very happy that it never

955.9 --> 964.24
really does so anyway yeah take care of

958.9 --> 966.4
man and yeah one of the when I was

964.24 --> 970.2
always like stomach sick one of the

966.4 --> 974.47
things was is that gree tea green tea is

970.2 --> 978.3000000000001
didn't feel bad to me and because it's

974.47 --> 981.9100000000001
kind of warm or maybe not and um not hot

978.3 --> 983.8599999999999
it doesn't it didn't trigger my system

981.91 --> 987.3399999999999
too much but you had at the same time

983.86 --> 990.79
you might respond to the the what is it

987.34 --> 993.61
D that the tea factor which is like a

990.79 --> 996.2199999999999
sort of a caffeine it could be that you

993.61 --> 999.19
could respond bad to that so be careful

996.22 --> 1001.02
don't never overdo things yours when

999.19 --> 1007.74
your stomach sick but you could try for

1001.02 --> 1010.38
me it always kind of worked it's a mild

1007.74 --> 1012.99
drink and if it if it impacts too much

1010.38 --> 1016.95
then maybe yeah lengthen it down with a

1012.99 --> 1019.6800000000001
bit of water maybe cold water so you can

1016.95 --> 1022.11
get the the not too hot not too cold

1019.68 --> 1032.339
temperature which will also make it more

1022.11 --> 1034.6200000000001
easy for your system yeah and his

1032.339 --> 1038.03
stomach sickness don't drink coffee

1034.62 --> 1038.03
they don't don't even try

1043.14 --> 1049.0300000000002
all right mark Collard yeah well I know

1046.36 --> 1054.9699999999998
how terrible it is to be in that state

1049.03 --> 1056.8899999999999
and how much it can help if you because

1054.97 --> 1059.14
I don't know for some reason when that

1056.89 --> 1062.38
happens to me I always feel like help

1059.14 --> 1065.47
mommy you know it's you feel kind of

1062.38 --> 1067.8700000000001
weak in a way it's unexplicable and it

1065.47 --> 1070.09
just helps Somali so much when somebody

1067.87 --> 1074.4099999999999
just shows you that they understand you

1070.09 --> 1078.87
know so I'm just trying to do unto

1074.41 --> 1078.8700000000001
others as I wish they do onto me

1079.14 --> 1085.96
drinking coffee right now oh they're

1081.76 --> 1088.72
well be careful you know test it out for

1085.96 --> 1091.48
me when I was stomach sick and I drank

1088.72 --> 1097.6000000000001
coffee it could like it whipped me bad

1091.48 --> 1099.82
so be careful with that I don't know I'm

1097.6 --> 1102.3899999999999
just comparing it to my personal

1099.82 --> 1102.3899999999999
experience

1108.59 --> 1114.57
[Music]

1109.879 --> 1117.57
also a thing especially if like the sick

1114.57 --> 1120.149
feeling keeps on coming back one thing

1117.57 --> 1124.229
that works outside of like drinking and

1120.149 --> 1126.6899999999998
stuff is walking for me always worked

1124.229 --> 1129.179
very especially when sickness feelings

1126.69 --> 1131.309
keeps on hanging around and then sitting

1129.179 --> 1133.019
still makes it worse or whatever just

1131.309 --> 1137.149
keep on walking if a good walk in a

1133.019 --> 1139.83
forest almost like a March and then the

1137.149 --> 1144.7089999999998
bouncing motions on your hips from the

1139.83 --> 1147.779
walking actually has a what is it they

1144.709 --> 1150.5890000000002
almost like a massaging quality and it

1147.779 --> 1152.94
releases certain endorphins your system

1150.589 --> 1154.9189999999999
pumps around because you're moved it

1152.94 --> 1157.559
actually works really well for me just

1154.919 --> 1168.1190000000001
walking so that might be an option as

1157.559 --> 1170.369
well yeah anyway yes yes mark color is

1168.119 --> 1173.369
not feeling well and I'm just trying to

1170.369 --> 1175.579
give general advice and I'm sure he'll

1173.369 --> 1175.579
be fine

1181.26 --> 1188.33
yeah while you spelled it right you just

1184.35 --> 1188.33
felt it correctly there fat bike Nomad

1191.36 --> 1196.52
yeah a lot of people have trouble with

1193.71 --> 1203.51
my name even to this day the auto vision

1196.52 --> 1207.0
or are we in or yeah I don't know why

1203.51 --> 1209.22
but practically for the way it's

1207.0 --> 1212.88
pronounced in English it's just the J a

1209.22 --> 1218.51
silence just our win because there is no

1212.88 --> 1223.19
official sound for that Dutch use of of

1218.51 --> 1231.24
vowels the a there is doesn't exist

1223.19 --> 1235.94
English so I just pick in just de just

1231.24 --> 1235.94
make it easy easier on the tongue

1263.63 --> 1266.5900000000001
hmm

1270.95 --> 1279.9
well Amanda young look if it is like I

1276.559 --> 1282.4189999999999
don't really even believe in the concept

1279.9 --> 1284.49
of like the stomach virus as it is

1282.419 --> 1286.5590000000002
presented maybe there is something going

1284.49 --> 1289.46
on and the virus could be aside maybe

1286.559 --> 1293.52
there is something or it's very rare

1289.46 --> 1296.3700000000001
like presuming now with for the moment

1293.52 --> 1300.049
that one more colored has literally is a

1296.37 --> 1303.059
stomach virus as it is presented then

1300.049 --> 1307.5
just taking nothing I wouldn't

1303.059 --> 1310.2
necessarily help like but if it was a

1307.5 --> 1313.169
virus then I would go for a vitamin C

1310.2 --> 1320.13
solution because that can also work on

1313.169 --> 1321.69
viruses or even colloidal silver you

1320.13 --> 1324.0300000000002
know you could even just gulp down

1321.69 --> 1326.25
colloidal silver that might then work if

1324.03 --> 1328.5
you're truly convinced that it is an

1326.25 --> 1334.19
infection that it is an inflammation due

1328.5 --> 1337.11
to a foreign body that's hostile but I

1334.19 --> 1339.24
estimate the chances chances of that

1337.11 --> 1343.1689999999999
literally being like that actually is

1339.24 --> 1345.63
extremely rare in reality that's my

1343.169 --> 1348.42
estimate

1345.63 --> 1352.44
[Music]

1348.42 --> 1355.29
and hey one way or the other vitamin C

1352.44 --> 1359.97
is always good and again green tea also

1355.29 --> 1363.2
has vitamin C so that is C some things

1359.97 --> 1366.78
just work no matter the perspective

1363.2 --> 1372.24
that's how I like to do things from all

1366.78 --> 1380.85
angles just be as solid as possible from

1372.24 --> 1391.7
every direction no I get it

1380.85 --> 1395.36
that's that's a lie you walked in today

1391.7 --> 1395.3600000000001
the wrong saloon

1413.52 --> 1420.66
hmm swish mouth with silver as the

1417.51 --> 1425.4
mouthwash daily and swallow yeah my ace

1420.66 --> 1428.91
MacLeod I agree silver from my personal

1425.4 --> 1433.3500000000001
experience works very well on well on

1428.91 --> 1438.0
dental dental relationships like the the

1433.35 --> 1439.5
mouth it's very good for that you can

1438.0 --> 1442.04
even make it yourself by the way

1439.5 --> 1446.1
colloidal silver but you do have to be

1442.04 --> 1448.59
very yeah like very precise about you

1446.1 --> 1450.75
can fool around or you can mess up the

1448.59 --> 1452.97
mixture you have to have perfectly pure

1450.75 --> 1454.86
water you have to make the conditions

1452.97 --> 1456.66
right now pollutions you have to get you

1454.86 --> 1458.49
make sure that you're doing it correctly

1456.66 --> 1460.8000000000002
and then you can make excellent

1458.49 --> 1463.88
colloidal silver I used to do that I

1460.8 --> 1467.97
don't have the device anymore yeah my ex

1463.88 --> 1471.5700000000002
Pauline she ordered it but that was

1467.97 --> 1474.15
awesome it worked really nicely and yeah

1471.57 --> 1477.78
I use a toothpaste currently that has

1474.15 --> 1482.49
colloidal silver in it and literally

1477.78 --> 1487.77
once I started using that I've never had

1482.49 --> 1490.05
a serious jaw ache or dent a tooth ache

1487.77 --> 1491.8799999999999
since that like I have like the moment

1490.05 --> 1494.25
where it's like yeah and it seems to be

1491.88 --> 1499.2
like something wants to change or move

1494.25 --> 1502.05
or like yeah but people move in a city

1499.2 --> 1503.97
so dough do certain things just want to

1502.05 --> 1509.36
change or rearrange or whatever and that

1503.97 --> 1512.34
can hurt but just minor well before a

1509.36 --> 1517.8899999999999
big part of my life I just had a huge

1512.34 --> 1520.3799999999999
joy or or even a typical cult-related

1517.89 --> 1522.7800000000002
things and that would creep into my jaw

1520.38 --> 1524.49
and it could be agony at times like even

1522.78 --> 1526.73
during the flat earth talk days when I

1524.49 --> 1530.16
didn't have that okay

1526.73 --> 1533.49
in between I had moments of just being

1530.16 --> 1535.92
in agony a lot from physical pain that

1533.49 --> 1538.71
would not also it couldn't be suppressed

1535.92 --> 1541.89
by yeah pain medication and I'm not good

1538.71 --> 1544.8600000000001
I wasn't ready to try just heavy [ __ ]

1541.89 --> 1547.5300000000002
because I knew like if we go that that

1544.86 --> 1548.2199999999998
everything just get worse so I was just

1547.53 --> 1550.35
like no I'm

1548.22 --> 1551.789
sit through the [ __ ] I've experienced it

1550.35 --> 1554.61
a lot it throughout my life and I'm just

1551.789 --> 1557.28
gonna find a proper solution and I guess

1554.61 --> 1559.9799999999998
that the toothpaste in question and also

1557.28 --> 1561.87
the application of iodine because it

1559.98 --> 1566.909
also has that like the combination of

1561.87 --> 1572.57
iodine and silver since I started use it

1566.909 --> 1575.2800000000002
just went away completely entirely

1572.57 --> 1577.35
doesn't mean that I don't have any kind

1575.28 --> 1583.08
of issues with my teeth anymore but no

1577.35 --> 1585.51
more no more pain they had pain issues

1583.08 --> 1591.27
or like apparent inflammation issues and

1585.51 --> 1593.19
nothing and as anybody that has

1591.27 --> 1598.58
experienced serious toothache is knows

1593.19 --> 1598.5800000000002
yeah that [ __ ] is another level

1607.31 --> 1611.95
okay Missouri bear and whatever you like

1612.22 --> 1621.16
I've been smoking so you know but I'm

1618.02 --> 1624.74
pretty sure that the positive effects

1621.16 --> 1628.0700000000002
are yeah if I really wanted to get the

1624.74 --> 1630.08
the positive effects of of the cannabis

1628.07 --> 1633.86
plants I probably have to go for the

1630.08 --> 1635.72
oils or the yeah see but yeah like CBD

1633.86 --> 1637.52
oils that's so much more effective

1635.72 --> 1640.82
probably than just smoking at the

1637.52 --> 1642.44
smoking is it's a mix of things it's

1640.82 --> 1647.06
like okay if you're gonna smoke

1642.44 --> 1650.8700000000001
something as as a smoker then that is

1647.06 --> 1653.33
probably one of the least bad things

1650.87 --> 1654.9799999999998
although yeah the entire influence it

1653.33 --> 1657.3999999999999
will have on you depending on the

1654.98 --> 1660.35
individual can be pretty heavy in

1657.4 --> 1663.02
several directions potentially positive

1660.35 --> 1669.32
but also negative depends on the

1663.02 --> 1672.44
individual and yeah for me it definitely

1669.32 --> 1675.5
has upsides but it also has almost equal

1672.44 --> 1677.6000000000001
downsides sometimes I noticed that that

1675.5 --> 1679.99
was just a big difference in the periods

1677.6 --> 1686.33
when I didn't smoke and when they did

1679.99 --> 1689.14
big difference most both yeah

1686.33 --> 1689.1399999999999
positive and negative

1690.86 --> 1697.9499999999998
all right hm yeah I'd love to

1693.78 --> 1700.61
I have in the past but I don't have the

1697.95 --> 1700.6100000000001
space for it

1706.25 --> 1716.64
well Voynich the amalgam it can do that

1711.93 --> 1722.13
it depends you can test that I have

1716.64 --> 1724.47
amalgams too still but every time I've

1722.13 --> 1727.68
tested it in various ways

1724.47 --> 1731.1000000000001
it didn't yeah mine don't seem to be

1727.68 --> 1739.47
releasing like mercury gases or anything

1731.1 --> 1742.35
I haven't been specifically advised like

1739.47 --> 1745.3500000000001
you should get rid of that quickly even

1742.35 --> 1747.33
though I was worried about that when I

1745.35 --> 1748.8
heard the stories about this like oh I

1747.33 --> 1752.51
don't want that I won't want to be

1748.8 --> 1756.12
poisoned so but yeah apparently it

1752.51 --> 1759.09
wasn't necessary still is it necessary I

1756.12 --> 1762.4499999999998
don't know I haven't inquired about it

1759.09 --> 1767.9099999999999
for some time and Amanda young well I

1762.45 --> 1772.64
don't I don't smoke cigarettes very very

1767.91 --> 1776.16
very rarely smoke yourself rolled

1772.64 --> 1780.48
cigarettes as it were I used to do that

1776.16 --> 1782.49
more I've I've had period where I didn't

1780.48 --> 1784.8600000000001
smell cannabis for quite a long time but

1782.49 --> 1790.02
did smoke self-made cigarettes like that

1784.86 --> 1793.32
and then I quit doing that and then I

1790.02 --> 1796.02
started smoking cannabis again that

1793.32 --> 1798.6599999999999
didn't smoke tobacco and then kind of

1796.02 --> 1803.28
like what is it two and a half years ago

1798.66 --> 1806.1000000000001
I suddenly started to smoke it with with

1803.28 --> 1809.31
tobacco's again because just the pure

1806.1 --> 1812.27
cannabis smoking was not influencing me

1809.31 --> 1812.27
in a positive way

1812.67 --> 1818.72
I guess yeah think of it whatever you

1815.55 --> 1822.3
want I'm personally not too happy about

1818.72 --> 1823.95
just smoking tobacco on a regular basis

1822.3 --> 1826.2
but at least I'm not like the guy that

1823.95 --> 1829.95
always just needs to keep on smoking

1826.2 --> 1832.0800000000002
tobacco's because you've never did that

1829.95 --> 1836.6100000000001
for me and the tobacco's that I use is

1832.08 --> 1843.83
very light it's very like great

1836.61 --> 1846.84
very unpolluted American spirit light

1843.83 --> 1848.309
it's kind of the best that is generally

1846.84 --> 1851.01
available here there's much better

1848.309 --> 1854.36
qualities tobacco and love to sample

1851.01 --> 1857.49
some of it sometime but that's it I

1854.36 --> 1869.4499999999998
don't smoke it just like that

1857.49 --> 1869.45
I know very happy doesn't it oh yeah

1869.48 --> 1874.91
tobacco Sarah Mia and I held a few times

1872.22 --> 1874.91
for a year

1878.59 --> 1886.269
well it's my club I'm not familiar with

1881.649 --> 1891.6999999999998
tobacco ceremonies in detail I know that

1886.269 --> 1893.769
the some Native Americans use them in

1891.7 --> 1896.249
combination with other herbs I think as

1893.769 --> 1896.249
well but

1902.77 --> 1913.7
tobacco is bad for elves it all depends

1911.44 --> 1915.38
No thank you Amanda young for the

1913.7 --> 1920.44
six-dollar super chad the nation another

1915.38 --> 1926.3300000000002
two hours that will make two days yay

1920.44 --> 1929.42
yeah sure why not you know everything I

1926.33 --> 1932.24
need groceries a I don't have to go out

1929.42 --> 1934.99
anymore don't really want to because

1932.24 --> 1934.99
it's freaking cold

1944.45 --> 1948.04
they're morning doc Michael

1954.47 --> 1961.659
she's caring be on with squats

1967.41 --> 1974.6100000000001
every time I hear such things I'm like

1969.39 --> 1977.91
wow you actually did that maybe I've

1974.61 --> 1979.74
just I've put on an old mentality

1977.91 --> 1981.96
concern yet but on the other hand you

1979.74 --> 1984.63
know I've kind of reincorporated I don't

1981.96 --> 1986.88
like separately working out a lot for

1984.63 --> 1991.5300000000002
some reason I don't feel very good about

1986.88 --> 1994.41
myself when I do that even though I'm

1991.53 --> 1996.51
not very bad I've never been bad at

1994.41 --> 1998.49
sports couldn't bear to be bad like you

1996.51 --> 2004.36
know I'm gonna do something I'm not

1998.49 --> 2007.52
going to be the loser at least but I

2004.36 --> 2010.34
don't know I've just always tried to

2007.52 --> 2013.28
whenever I do something physical and

2010.34 --> 2017.75
kind of try to somehow turn it into a

2013.28 --> 2020.06
sport do something specific good about

2017.75 --> 2024.32
it like be extremely coordinate be

2020.06 --> 2029.84
extremely balanced be persistent

2024.32 --> 2031.55
this senses muscle control making sure

2029.84 --> 2033.9499999999998
you're being extremely aware and

2031.55 --> 2037.79
adaptable like for example in traffic

2033.95 --> 2040.01
and I am it's like that right accident

2037.79 --> 2042.4099999999999
never never never no matter how crazy

2040.01 --> 2046.09
things can get some people are nuts out

2042.41 --> 2048.98
there totally careless like I've had

2046.09 --> 2050.7799999999997
crazy situations where I'm on my bike

2048.98 --> 2054.23
and just suddenly from out of nowhere

2050.78 --> 2057.4700000000003
not even 2 meters in front of me a guy

2054.23 --> 2058.97
comes on a bike from the right in the

2057.47 --> 2062.5699999999997
wrong direction because it's a one

2058.97 --> 2067.0099999999998
direction bike lane texting on their

2062.57 --> 2070.1600000000003
mobile as they cut me off from but I saw

2067.01 --> 2072.71
it coming even though it literally like

2070.16 --> 2074.93
immediately I just felt like there's

2072.71 --> 2078.02
something that is completely rekkles I

2074.93 --> 2080.7999999999997
must go to the side just and he didn't

2078.02 --> 2083.36
hit me almost yeah if I hadn't done that

2080.8 --> 2085.4300000000003
he would have probably hit my steering

2083.36 --> 2089.4100000000003
wheel and it would've been a total [ __ ]

2085.43 --> 2092.48
you know but it is because I just

2089.41 --> 2095.3799999999997
whenever I do something I take it like

2092.48 --> 2095.38
sport like

2095.899 --> 2102.2
and also when I bike I just I hate just

2099.54 --> 2105.72
going along with the mob I just have to

2102.2 --> 2109.29
and perfectly don't get in the people's

2105.72 --> 2114.5699999999997
way don't seem extremely pushy don't

2109.29 --> 2118.47
make it an ego thing just be great be

2114.57 --> 2125.07
fast but not disruptive that's what I

2118.47 --> 2127.4399999999996
like you know it's like I hate it for

2125.07 --> 2130.38
example in car situations when there's

2127.44 --> 2133.35
just like a jack off with a with like a

2130.38 --> 2136.11
pimpy car and being a total you know

2133.35 --> 2138.39
what cutting off people and then it's

2136.11 --> 2140.01
like yeah everybody hates that guy

2138.39 --> 2142.95
here's an expensive car that's not a

2140.01 --> 2147.15
good way that's just it sucks that sucks

2142.95 --> 2148.98
but what if that same guy was super

2147.15 --> 2152.82
eloquent and he was like now I'm gonna

2148.98 --> 2156.39
be fast but I'm gonna be super sharp and

2152.82 --> 2158.94
it's just then it's gonna be like you

2156.39 --> 2163.62
you whoa what was that fast car

2158.94 --> 2166.62
wow that hmm and you have no bad no bad

2163.62 --> 2170.6099999999997
feelings now that is awesome that is

2166.62 --> 2172.62
something that I can appreciate just

2170.61 --> 2177.8700000000003
don't get in each other's way

2172.62 --> 2180.8399999999997
be vigilant around you don't don't let

2177.87 --> 2183.48
other people's take care of your safety

2180.84 --> 2185.58
in the situation always be adaptive to

2183.48 --> 2191.07
what's going around around you it's like

2185.58 --> 2193.89
a network and you're part of it I'm a

2191.07 --> 2196.2000000000003
New Yorker pedestrian superpowers yeah

2193.89 --> 2199.77
I've heard a lot about New York today

2196.2 --> 2202.5299999999997
that's that's one crowded place like I

2199.77 --> 2207.02
thought Amsterdam in the in the weekends

2202.53 --> 2209.1600000000003
was crowded but like New York just I

2207.02 --> 2214.41
don't think I'd feel very comfortable

2209.16 --> 2216.81
where it's a way to pressure but I think

2214.41 --> 2219.24
that if I'd have to I could probably

2216.81 --> 2225.2599999999998
work with the dynamics of how it works

2219.24 --> 2225.2599999999998
because I am vigilant enough anyway

2241.11 --> 2246.57
and routing last weekend well I did all

2244.98 --> 2250.29
depends on where I'm gonna be hanging

2246.57 --> 2252.96
around what I'm gonna be doing I don't

2250.29 --> 2255.9
think I'd like just walking on the

2252.96 --> 2259.26
streets for say six hour

2255.9 --> 2262.32
yeah that would absolute me just get

2259.26 --> 2265.7700000000004
very tiresome I guess but yeah I think I

2262.32 --> 2269.13
could probably just be in New York

2265.77 --> 2271.88
without getting overrun by a mob

2269.13 --> 2271.88
accidentally

2277.01 --> 2280.2490000000003
[Music]

2300.52 --> 2308.61
Wow New York having protests up against

2304.33 --> 2308.61
police who could have foreseen

2325.76 --> 2334.51
right yeah Manhattan's just it's a giant

2329.96 --> 2334.51
anthill our termite hill or at her

2349.39 --> 2361.33
I well if Robin Stanley wants to call me

2354.1 --> 2364.35
on skype sure she doesn't have to though

2361.33 --> 2364.35
she doesn't want to

2379.07 --> 2385.8500000000004
misery bear no that's not what I mean

2382.16 --> 2390.35
it's just that New York New York is like

2385.85 --> 2391.5499999999997
overrun with liberal with liberal

2390.35 --> 2394.15
irrationalism

2391.55 --> 2400.5800000000004
and with that comes like Oh police are

2394.15 --> 2403.73
always evil because they attack what we

2400.58 --> 2405.47
I Conniff I even though there's no

2403.73 --> 2407.54
reason behind it so they're just going

2405.47 --> 2414.4399999999996
to be police that's been going on for

2407.54 --> 2416.5099999999998
some time and people in New York for

2414.44 --> 2418.79
some reason the ones that do protest

2416.51 --> 2424.6000000000004
they're always want to be very fanatical

2418.79 --> 2426.92
I guess compared to general in general

2424.6 --> 2431.15
because they feel they always need to be

2426.92 --> 2434.3
special because it's New York I don't

2431.15 --> 2438.2000000000003
know to be fair I've never physically

2434.3 --> 2441.1400000000003
been in New York so I literally don't

2438.2 --> 2443.93
know through practical experience what

2441.14 --> 2446.75
I'm talking about but ya heard of some

2443.93 --> 2449.93
things about New York and have gotten to

2446.75 --> 2454.85
know a few people in my time in New York

2449.93 --> 2457.64
not face-to-face looked into like going

2454.85 --> 2461.0
out and even the gothic scenes in like

2457.64 --> 2466.67
through the internet nothing in person

2461.0 --> 2468.92
so but I always got with feeling in New

2466.67 --> 2471.82
York is like they they they want to be

2468.92 --> 2471.82
special

2488.29 --> 2490.98
what

2492.91 --> 2495.569
that's

2495.85 --> 2500.31
is that supposed to be funny

2504.48 --> 2507.109
age

2509.49 --> 2516.22
and

2511.72 --> 2518.79
is that funny or is your psychopath

2516.22 --> 2521.3799999999997
showing there it's not funny

2518.79 --> 2521.98
is anybody here thinking that that is

2521.38 --> 2524.02
funny

2521.98 --> 2526.75
that what ace MacLeod said that that is

2524.02 --> 2529.38
funny because I'm pretty damn sure he

2526.75 --> 2529.38
meant it as a joke

2542.43 --> 2547.14
yeah that's not funny you know what that

2545.4 --> 2549.319
is that's a call to playing ground

2547.14 --> 2551.609
it's a playing ground right there and

2549.319 --> 2553.319
children play there and have fun and

2551.609 --> 2555.839
some of them even fool around with

2553.319 --> 2567.27
fireworks what you just said there is

2555.839 --> 2569.849
just extremely repulsive oh yeah sure

2567.27 --> 2573.96
you know how this torture is so funny so

2569.849 --> 2578.2200000000003
funny to just there's a joke put that in

2573.96 --> 2581.01
there it's it's disgusting yeah oh yeah

2578.22 --> 2582.8089999999997
yeah it's disgusting that that thought

2581.01 --> 2584.8190000000004
just slipped in there and you thought it

2582.809 --> 2593.01
was just normal to put that out there

2584.819 --> 2596.0
it's disgusting dude no but do you think

2593.01 --> 2599.4900000000002
that that is normal

2596.0 --> 2602.69
I'm just asking or is this getting too

2599.49 --> 2602.6899999999996
serious for you

2618.57 --> 2625.44
God look I know who ace is but there's

2623.37 --> 2629.31
just points where he tends to cross the

2625.44 --> 2632.4900000000002
line with with jokes because everything

2629.31 --> 2636.0
he says is always a joke right that's

2632.49 --> 2641.66
his stick but this was just disgusting

2636.0 --> 2641.66
why would you say that it's just wrong

2642.74 --> 2649.5
yeah exactly I agree to her stand for it

2646.26 --> 2653.09
so I'm just asking him to check himself

2649.5 --> 2653.09
before you do more damage

2653.27 --> 2657.63
[Music]

2671.45 --> 2680.4399999999996
you know when when I think about

2673.73 --> 2683.66
children I think about just this fresh

2680.44 --> 2686.9900000000002
divine energy in them and the own

2683.66 --> 2689.45
innocence and and also the trials also

2686.99 --> 2690.74
their their own personal little demons

2689.45 --> 2694.0
that they have to deal with like

2690.74 --> 2696.319
annoying little parts about them or

2694.0 --> 2699.26
certain types of things that they do

2696.319 --> 2701.48
that they think is okay but later figure

2699.26 --> 2705.5
out is not I see those things and

2701.48 --> 2707.089
children and and I just wanna I really

2705.5 --> 2709.91
just want to protect them that's my

2707.089 --> 2711.95
instinct and I can get very annoyed by

2709.91 --> 2714.74
children especially when they act like

2711.95 --> 2718.0989999999997
that but why do I get annoyed because it

2714.74 --> 2720.7099999999996
reminds me about myself having such

2718.099 --> 2724.819
typical annoying traits even as a little

2720.71 --> 2727.16
kid that I refuse to let go of and that

2724.819 --> 2729.079
in retrospect which is really ugly to me

2727.16 --> 2734.45
so it reminds me of that that agitates

2729.079 --> 2741.799
me but I'm not like oh you're bad no

2734.45 --> 2744.02
it's just misled or mistaken and that is

2741.799 --> 2747.92
how I like to think about children every

2744.02 --> 2749.93
time somebody brings up all this I don't

2747.92 --> 2751.88
even want to say it I haven't said it

2749.93 --> 2757.7599999999998
even once every time somebody brings

2751.88 --> 2762.88
that up it just it's like is that what

2757.76 --> 2767.5200000000004
you think about in the face of children

2762.88 --> 2770.58
that's bad you know

2767.52 --> 2773.16
be careful studying your perceived enemy

2770.58 --> 2778.59
or yeah before you know it you'll turn

2773.16 --> 2782.6
into them by accident not it's very over

2778.59 --> 2782.6000000000004
generalized but there is something to it

2789.31 --> 2799.84
Oh age McCloud I'll let everybody else

2795.58 --> 2805.92
be the judge of it you know I'm not the

2799.84 --> 2809.4700000000003
guy that's just gonna let bad jokes go

2805.92 --> 2813.2200000000003
because it is that guy and everybody

2809.47 --> 2817.5699999999997
knows that guy so no a bad joke is a bad

2813.22 --> 2819.16
joke I didn't give a rat's ass if you're

2817.57 --> 2823.26
the freakin President of the United

2819.16 --> 2826.1499999999996
States if it's wrong I'll say it's wrong

2823.26 --> 2828.94
if I even get informed about it you know

2826.15 --> 2833.08
I'm not gonna say is in my chat at least

2828.94 --> 2834.7000000000003
that's it you know and even with mark

2833.08 --> 2837.5499999999997
sergeant has these things mark

2834.7 --> 2843.85
sergeant's sometimes has some bad stuff

2837.55 --> 2846.4900000000002
as a joke and then I'm left like yeah I

2843.85 --> 2849.88
get it I get what you're trying to do

2846.49 --> 2851.7099999999996
but I just don't like it and I guess

2849.88 --> 2855.67
there's people out there that kind of go

2851.71 --> 2860.2
with that but I just have to say that's

2855.67 --> 2862.12
wrong I just got to do it if I happen to

2860.2 --> 2866.2599999999998
be in the chat at the time and hey AB

2862.12 --> 2867.88
are those jokes I really appreciate mark

2866.26 --> 2872.01
Sargent and I think he's a great guy

2867.88 --> 2872.01
it's just sometimes you know

2877.76 --> 2880.929
[Music]

2881.8 --> 2887.05
yeah drunken bullet 401 what wait what

2885.01 --> 2887.7700000000004
did Trump do now yeah that's the

2887.05 --> 2889.63
question

2887.77 --> 2891.91
I think there was like wasn't there

2889.63 --> 2896.11
impeachment process going and there's

2891.91 --> 2899.17
like what did Trump do wrong is almost

2896.11 --> 2903.4900000000002
like trying to find out what gravity is

2899.17 --> 2907.0
at this point you know everybody assumes

2903.49 --> 2909.8799999999997
he did something wrong they're going

2907.0 --> 2912.16
with it and they're very confident in

2909.88 --> 2914.5
knowing that he must have done something

2912.16 --> 2918.46
wrong and they'll figure out they'll

2914.5 --> 2920.44
just put out the works and then along

2918.46 --> 2921.45
the way they'll find that thing that he

2920.44 --> 2925.75
did wrong

2921.45 --> 2928.2999999999997
guess what just like with gravity knew

2925.75 --> 2930.13
so yeah as I said it before the whole

2928.3 --> 2937.42
impeachment stuff is just a complete

2930.13 --> 2941.31
waste of time just the worst so yeah

2937.42 --> 2941.31
anyway that's my analogy

2943.76 --> 2946.869
[Music]

2968.83 --> 2971.5499999999997
what

2971.619 --> 2975.1800000000003
Oh God

2977.89 --> 2983.2999999999997
does that happen every single time I'm

2980.63 --> 2992.4500000000003
gonna bring up Trump that's gonna be

2983.3 --> 2994.75
what you're gonna be doing yeah I should

2992.45 --> 2994.75
have known

3003.55 --> 3014.1290000000004
[Music]

3014.27 --> 3021.78
anyway I thought I thought my analogy

3017.72 --> 3024.06
comparison of the the process of gravity

3021.78 --> 3027.75
and how it's considered in science and

3024.06 --> 3030.0299999999997
and Trump's impeachment I thought it was

3027.75 --> 3033.83
kind of a funny comparison really I

3030.03 --> 3036.27
think it's not that that much far off

3033.83 --> 3039.0
this is kind of almost like the same

3036.27 --> 3042.92
psychological process that rides it even

3039.0 --> 3042.92
in a way that wouldn't you agree

3046.85 --> 3051.45
you know the ballers never stop even

3049.83 --> 3053.19
though they literally have nothing they

3051.45 --> 3058.02
have no answers they just have more red

3053.19 --> 3063.06
herring so it seems like the whole crazy

3058.02 --> 3065.82
leftist Democrats in America are kind of

3063.06 --> 3070.38
like doing the same sort of thing just a

3065.82 --> 3073.8590000000004
lot of pull we got control we were gonna

3070.38 --> 3078.02
take the all Bravada and a lot of waste

3073.859 --> 3078.02
of time just like the ballers in a way

3096.17 --> 3103.0
let's see I think I I've been on for two

3101.3 --> 3106.19
hours now

3103.0 --> 3107.75
so I'm gonna round out the show yeah

3106.19 --> 3109.73
it's been in two part because my

3107.75 --> 3111.83
internet connection decided to die on me

3109.73 --> 3114.17
again in halfway in the stream while I

3111.83 --> 3116.75
stepped away so I didn't see it in order

3114.17 --> 3121.28
to quickly prevent the stream from being

3116.75 --> 3122.9
cut off well yeah I'm gonna be back

3121.28 --> 3128.42
tomorrow with flattered early-bird

3122.9 --> 3133.1
number 370 you may see me around it in
