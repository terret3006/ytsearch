is really really mixed I mean right now

130.38 --> 134.4
there's the sun coming out so that's

132.06 --> 138.0
kind of nice

134.4 --> 140.54
this patch Blue Sky up there

138.0 --> 140.54
come on

140.7 --> 146.459

142.819 --> 148.64
it's I can't get my camera to focus on

146.459 --> 148.64000000000001
it

150.12 --> 157.8
or it's not blue enough anyway

153.72 --> 160.5
it's a bit of sun and then like a minute

157.8 --> 162.9
later like a gigantic cloud like that's

160.5 --> 165.18
come fly comes flying over

162.9 --> 168.239
and then it rains

165.18 --> 172.28
so like not even 15 minutes ago it

168.239 --> 172.28
rained pretty hard actually

172.92 --> 177.14
but now it's sunny so that's cool

181.08 --> 183.68
right

185.82 --> 188.91

260.28 --> 265.32
no thanks for that I mean it has been

262.68 --> 267.78000000000003
extremely helpful I mean

265.32 --> 269.52
because of those little donations I was

267.78 --> 274.46
just like

269.52 --> 274.46
just not completely broke

274.919 --> 281.4
so I really like the little bits help

281.4 --> 286.79999999999995

286.8 --> 292.46000000000004
so

288.18 --> 292.46
right but I'm good for now

295.56 --> 302.46
hopefully so will my back although it's

299.82 --> 304.32
not really my back it's weird Everybody

302.46 --> 307.21999999999997
right away in the house is kind of

304.32 --> 307.21999999999997
coughing and stuff

307.5 --> 311.6
and I've been kind of sniffy

311.639 --> 317.36
but I'm having a lot of issues like with

314.16 --> 317.36
my shoulder again

320.1 --> 325.34000000000003
did go earlier to bed it does seem to

323.1 --> 325.34000000000003
help

328.68 --> 332.66
but yeah I need to work on it

334.979 --> 338.65999999999997
hey Richard G good to see you

343.62 --> 348.06
right anyway

346.08 --> 350.94
I don't know if I said it already but

348.06 --> 355.919
it's Thursday

350.94 --> 355.919
the 3rd of August 2023

358.72 --> 365.12
[Applause]

360.66 --> 365.12
temperatures 20 degrees Celsius right

369.6 --> 375.3
so yeah despite all that raininess the

372.539 --> 378.5
the temperature is just doing fine it's

375.3 --> 378.5
still kind of nice and warm

378.96 --> 384.65999999999997
you genuinely appreciate the show yeah

381.06 --> 386.039
thanks I mean I have been doing my best

384.66 --> 388.38000000000005
a lot

386.039 --> 391.38
I think

388.38 --> 394.259
I've been rolling out some good stuff it

391.38 --> 397.5
also like when I watch it back I am

394.259 --> 399.24
noticing now like in the last I've done

397.5 --> 402.419
it like three times in the last month

399.24 --> 404.58
I'm just noticing there's so many so

402.419 --> 407.46
much less

404.58 --> 410.46
moments where I'm like oh I wish I

407.46 --> 414.0
hadn't done that

410.46 --> 414.84
so like I've really cleaned up my ACT I

414.0 --> 418.699
think

414.84 --> 421.56
like even on the more impulsive

418.699 --> 424.56
subconscious level

421.56 --> 427.199
and yeah still rolling out good stuff I

424.56 --> 430.039
mean I'm still in my mind

427.199 --> 430.039
I kinda

431.88 --> 436.68
Brewing around this whole colloidal

434.94 --> 440.3
suspension thing

436.68 --> 440.3
I find it very fascinating

441.12 --> 447.539
now it is like

444.12 --> 448.8
it's pretty high end in it in in its own

447.539 --> 451.8
way

448.8 --> 454.62
so like high-ends mechanics

451.8 --> 459.68
so yeah I wasn't like expecting

454.62 --> 459.68
everybody to immediately jump in on that

459.78 --> 463.13899999999995
but it's something that caught my

462.06 --> 465.78000000000003
attention

463.139 --> 467.34000000000003
an effect that really got my attention

465.78 --> 472.31899999999996
and the

467.34 --> 473.75899999999996
well the coral correlation in this case

472.319 --> 476.46000000000004
with

473.759 --> 479.28000000000003
crystalline structure

476.46 --> 483.13899999999995
just stands out to me

479.28 --> 483.13899999999995
but it is just a correlation though

485.4 --> 491.65999999999997
and of course like well entire

488.18 --> 496.099
repertoire of ideas that have been

491.66 --> 496.09900000000005
rolling out for years now

497.16 --> 501.66
yeah

498.86 --> 504.47900000000004
due to time

501.66 --> 505.44
difference I don't join the live chat a

504.479 --> 506.81899999999996
lot

505.44 --> 508.56
ready for me

506.819 --> 511.91900000000004
right

508.56 --> 514.64
yeah Mojo yeah you're you're in the

511.919 --> 514.64
Americas right

515.64 --> 518.24
I understand

518.58 --> 522.2
glad you can make it this time

525.62 --> 530.72
right

527.58 --> 530.72
yeah now I am

530.76 --> 535.62
although like of course the live chat

533.16 --> 539.2199999999999
for me is very important

535.62 --> 541.26
for how I how I do my show it's like I

539.22 --> 544.019
don't want to do this alone completely

541.26 --> 546.3
and you guys give great feedback at

544.019 --> 548.04
times and sometimes if it's not so great

546.3 --> 550.26
well then

548.04 --> 552.24
at least you'll be part of a pattern

550.26 --> 554.3389999999999
that I can be noticing like hey there's

552.24 --> 558.779
something in the air today right

554.339 --> 562.6800000000001
it's like the spiritual forecast not

558.779 --> 565.56
astrology based just like sampling it

562.68 --> 568.019
it's like a like one of those people

565.56 --> 570.66
that professionally like goes around and

568.019 --> 572.88
takes water samples of the ground

570.66 --> 577.019
for the quality and control and all that

572.88 --> 579.36
except I do it with the spirit I just go

577.019 --> 583.16
out and like huh what's out there right

579.36 --> 583.16
now what's what's going on

586.94 --> 593.7600000000001
right so I use the chat like for roughly

591.18 --> 596.04
one third that's how I set it up but

593.76 --> 597.36
two-thirds I definitely keep in mind

596.04 --> 599.519
that

597.36 --> 602.64
this is gonna have to be watchable

599.519 --> 606.92
afterward like there's like two-thirds

602.64 --> 606.92
in my mind that are watching afterward

607.019 --> 615.12
it I can't just be doing like only us

610.98 --> 617.519
guys in that moment type things

615.12 --> 620.4590000000001
if I just do that too much yeah then

617.519 --> 622.86
it's going to be basically like

620.459 --> 625.0189999999999
an online video call with you guys in

622.86 --> 627.24
the chat but

625.019 --> 628.38
that would make it even more appealing I

627.24 --> 633.24
guess

628.38 --> 634.62
maybe sometimes but also it yeah it

633.24 --> 637.08
would

634.62 --> 640.92
kind of drift my attention to way to

637.08 --> 642.9590000000001
really be here to represent an idea to

640.92 --> 645.06
put something down to it would decrease

642.959 --> 647.279
on my teacher's function

645.06 --> 649.56
like towards the audience instead of

647.279 --> 652.32
just towards the chat so I definitely

649.56 --> 654.68
keep all of that in mind as I do my

652.32 --> 654.6800000000001
shows

659.04 --> 663.24
right so a lot of the times I do my

661.26 --> 667.26
shows and then like in the middle of it

663.24 --> 669.66
or afterward I'm like oh this is not a

667.26 --> 671.459
good show even though we might have had

669.66 --> 673.38
a lot of fun a lot of things happening

671.459 --> 675.5999999999999
but it's just like yeah there wasn't

673.38 --> 678.12
really good cohesive ideas that were put

675.6 --> 680.279
down so when I say that's like yeah it's

678.12 --> 681.66
been yeah the show maybe not giving it a

680.279 --> 683.76
title this time

681.66 --> 687.26
it's not like there wasn't anything

683.76 --> 687.26
happening it's just that

688.079 --> 694.019
yeah it's not super interesting for

692.04 --> 695.88
other people to watch it like there's a

694.019 --> 697.7
bigger chance that people will look into

695.88 --> 700.26
it just now just like oh it's really

697.7 --> 702.36
going back and forth with the chat it's

700.26 --> 706.04
all over the place they're more likely

702.36 --> 706.04
to like discontinue watching

706.92 --> 711.36
right unless you're a real Digger and

709.32 --> 712.9200000000001
you know like yeah but maybe at the end

711.36 --> 716.779
of it the gem will come because

712.92 --> 716.779
sometimes it does with me

716.88 --> 724.1
right but

718.74 --> 724.1
the gems I do try to basically

725.22 --> 729.3000000000001
catch the more interesting parts that

727.62 --> 731.4590000000001
are especially for the afterward

729.3 --> 733.3199999999999
Watchers and then kind of like craft

731.459 --> 735.3
them into the title

733.32 --> 739.5600000000001
so that you can like

735.3 --> 742.3199999999999
as a watcher almost know like oh this is

739.56 --> 743.9399999999999
what I should be digging for or what I

742.32 --> 746.36
should be looking out for when I watch

743.94 --> 746.36
the show

747.06 --> 752.0999999999999
to give you like an anticipation heads

750.06 --> 753.8389999999999
up so yeah that's how I do it I don't

752.1 --> 756.9590000000001
know why I'm getting so met up today

753.839 --> 759.1800000000001
it's just I'm describing it

756.959 --> 761.5189999999999
yeah

759.18 --> 763.6999999999999
but yeah I really do appreciate the

761.519 --> 763.7
support

764.579 --> 768.56
and I'm glad you're getting a lot out of

766.26 --> 768.56
my show

772.079 --> 778.8599999999999
that's great I mean I knew I need that

775.68 --> 780.899
too besides just financials where I like

778.86 --> 783.0600000000001
encouragement because

780.899 --> 786.74
I don't know sometimes I have this weird

783.06 --> 789.54
internal tendency probably for my

786.74 --> 792.24
self-deprecating days where I look down

789.54 --> 794.76
upon myself where I'm like

792.24 --> 797.04
well thank god at least I'm not

794.76 --> 798.18
completely useless that there's people

797.04 --> 800.459
there

798.18 --> 803.399
that are appreciating what I do I

800.459 --> 806.16
genuinely and I know that's an

803.399 --> 808.56
unreasonable position as a perspective

806.16 --> 810.779
but unfortunately that's just kind of

808.56 --> 813.2399999999999
what happens

810.779 --> 816.18
but I'll never like try to force that

813.24 --> 817.86
view of myself onto people

816.18 --> 820.399
other people

817.86 --> 820.399
you

820.74 --> 826.98
if you think I'm awesome then I accept

823.68 --> 830.9399999999999
that you think I'm awesome

826.98 --> 833.519
just know that I have internal issues

830.94 --> 834.6
where sometimes I just don't think great

833.519 --> 837.66
of myself

834.6 --> 841.9200000000001
although I will

837.66 --> 841.92
in a way contrastingly

841.98 --> 845.88
do put myself down I will claim it

844.74 --> 848.339
though

845.88 --> 850.26
but despite all of that internally still

848.339 --> 852.3000000000001
it's like yeah but you're still like a

850.26 --> 854.459
piece of [ __ ]

852.3 --> 856.3199999999999
yeah you think you're doing your best oh

854.459 --> 858.18
you're getting better yeah but you're

856.32 --> 860.1600000000001
still not getting all those things you

858.18 --> 862.56
originally wanted now are you are in

860.16 --> 865.38
that sort of [ __ ]

862.56 --> 868.8599999999999
but then I do not take those moments as

865.38 --> 871.74
like oh well then I'm gonna be I'm gonna

868.86 --> 873.72
get make a house no I never do that but

871.74 --> 876.36
despite me never giving in to such

873.72 --> 878.7
feelings anymore they do still keep

876.36 --> 881.22
coming back I guess it's because when I

878.7 --> 883.399
was much younger especially my teens I

881.22 --> 886.9200000000001
had it a lot and then I did actually

883.399 --> 889.62
lose to it gave into it

886.92 --> 891.7199999999999
and that kind of makes it come echoing

889.62 --> 893.399
back I think

891.72 --> 895.98
so hopefully

893.399 --> 897.899
as the decades progress if I still have

895.98 --> 900.0600000000001
that long

897.899 --> 901.98
I'm gonna assume I am even though

900.06 --> 905.2199999999999
sometimes I really think I could die any

901.98 --> 905.22
second yeah

907.38 --> 912.0
I'm gonna assume that over time it's

909.899 --> 913.62
gonna be less and less and less until

912.0 --> 915.839
it's like yeah

913.62 --> 918.839
in my past I used to think really bad

915.839 --> 921.0790000000001
about myself I have no more such issues

918.839 --> 923.7600000000001
I'm I'm really looking forward to

921.079 --> 925.8599999999999
arriving to that

923.76 --> 928.26
frequency

925.86 --> 930.24
but it's probably still gonna take some

928.26 --> 932.88
time

930.24 --> 935.1
and I have to be more grounded I have to

932.88 --> 939.019
have manifested more I have to have

935.1 --> 939.019
proven myself more

939.36 --> 944.639
to the outside world I mean to myself I

942.36 --> 948.74
think I've proven sufficiently that the

944.639 --> 948.74
thing I set out to do that I do it well

951.0 --> 957.62
anyway

953.279 --> 957.62
low Oz Maximus flatius

958.019 --> 964.339
what do you think about the dissing that

960.18 --> 964.3389999999999
Elvis I don't really care

965.579 --> 970.04
shouldn't everyone be free to their own

968.76 --> 972.66
opinions

970.04 --> 975.779
verbal violence

972.66 --> 978.12
what verbal violence Maximus what is

975.779 --> 981.56
somebody getting threatened

978.12 --> 981.5600000000001
who is getting threatened

988.019 --> 994.62
if I is called criticism

991.32 --> 998.22
it's called holding up standards Maximus

994.62 --> 1000.68
flatius it's the sign of a

998.22 --> 1004.0
non-tyrannical

1000.68 --> 1004.0
social format

1004.22 --> 1009.5
where you're just like yeah

1007.1 --> 1011.86
you gotta duke it out sometimes it keeps

1009.5 --> 1011.86
happening

1014.66 --> 1019.1
I mean

1016.88 --> 1021.32
realize that that sort of thing used to

1019.1 --> 1023.48
happen a lot around in the world

1021.32 --> 1026.1200000000001
everywhere

1023.48 --> 1029.419
people getting disagreements and they

1026.12 --> 1031.6989999999998
duke it out and back way back it might

1029.419 --> 1034.16
have been like physical fist fighting

1031.699 --> 1036.439
much more I mean physical fist fighting

1034.16 --> 1038.959
used to be kind of normal it's one of

1036.439 --> 1041.419
those things where I feel like

1038.959 --> 1043.64
yeah I'm really glad that's in the past

1041.419 --> 1048.14
that's one of those things I really

1043.64 --> 1050.72
don't personally for a biological reason

1048.14 --> 1053.3600000000001
I'm not really eager to get that part

1050.72 --> 1055.46
back of the past I mean there's a were a

1053.36 --> 1056.299
lot of good things there but that one is

1055.46 --> 1059.48
like

1056.299 --> 1063.799
no I like this

1059.48 --> 1066.679
less physical violence thing but

1063.799 --> 1069.58
now there's just more word

1066.679 --> 1074.6200000000001
fighting in this era

1069.58 --> 1074.62
right and I'm a lot better at that

1079.46 --> 1084.4
I was never too eager to get like in

1081.62 --> 1084.3999999999999
fist fights

1085.46 --> 1091.82
uh but uh what was my point again

1089.72 --> 1095.299
yeah I mean there's no real

1091.82 --> 1098.1789999999999
it's just duking it out and I mean Dell

1095.299 --> 1101.0
is getting really weird with it

1098.179 --> 1103.4
and just making it all personal

1101.0 --> 1106.4
he doesn't have arguments like there's

1103.4 --> 1109.5800000000002
no arguments there and it's even weirder

1106.4 --> 1110.72
that reichi is like siding with him on

1109.58 --> 1111.799
this it's

1110.72 --> 1115.46
like

1111.799 --> 1118.4
there's no point in doing that

1115.46 --> 1120.559
she's just I feel like she's like

1118.4 --> 1122.539
foolishly engaged in like becoming like

1120.559 --> 1125.539
a meat shield for him

1122.539 --> 1127.82
just like why is she

1125.539 --> 1130.1
doing all that

1127.82 --> 1132.799
it's stupid it's a stupid position to

1130.1 --> 1135.98
take upwards Rising Earth is is

1132.799 --> 1139.1
completely a dead end

1135.98 --> 1141.74
and I don't get that people don't listen

1139.1 --> 1146.1789999999999
to me about it

1141.74 --> 1149.0
like I've said things I gave a detailed

1146.179 --> 1154.0
judgment about upward Rising Earth

1149.0 --> 1154.0
like before this all went crazy

1155.78 --> 1161.96
because I I was into it as a concept for

1159.26 --> 1164.9
a while a whole long time ago like it's

1161.96 --> 1168.14
not a new idea

1164.9 --> 1171.2
and it's unprovable and

1168.14 --> 1174.22
and they're just being belligerent and

1171.2 --> 1174.22
stubborn about it

1174.5 --> 1178.46
they're being like Ballers about it

1176.72 --> 1181.1000000000001
that's that's the most embarrassing part

1178.46 --> 1183.8600000000001
Dell is being like a baller about his

1181.1 --> 1186.799
upward Rising Earth

1183.86 --> 1189.559
it really is because he can't prove it

1186.799 --> 1191.96
is reifying things he's using

1189.559 --> 1194.24
pharmacological fallacies

1191.96 --> 1198.26
assuming everything is the way it is

1194.24 --> 1201.32
because of his postulation even though

1198.26 --> 1204.14
there's nothing he could even do to

1201.32 --> 1206.4189999999999
to test whether that is true or not he's

1204.14 --> 1208.8200000000002
not going to very manipulate it

1206.419 --> 1211.1000000000001
it can very manipulate things that are

1208.82 --> 1213.32
already happened and assumed to be

1211.1 --> 1215.84
caused by it

1213.32 --> 1218.6
so

1215.84 --> 1222.1999999999998
like argumentatively

1218.6 --> 1225.26
this is really really stupid

1222.2 --> 1228.559
and below

1225.26 --> 1232.28
below the bar it's like there's no need

1228.559 --> 1235.16
to do all this and to get all angry over

1232.28 --> 1238.1
it and add homie

1235.16 --> 1241.5800000000002
and yeah I think that Dell's kind of

1238.1 --> 1245.24
turning into Sean Hawkins I I'm not I'm

1241.58 --> 1247.6399999999999
not even like oh my gosh you don't feel

1245.24 --> 1248.419
that no no I'm I'm genuinely worried

1247.64 --> 1250.94
like

1248.419 --> 1255.0800000000002
it's starting to remind me of Sean

1250.94 --> 1257.98
Hawkins but with a Scottish accent

1255.08 --> 1257.98
seriously

1259.76 --> 1265.4
this is not good it's not good for Dell

1262.7 --> 1268.82
like for his own personal sanity alone I

1265.4 --> 1271.1000000000001
mean like like compare it to like Jim

1268.82 --> 1273.26
Bob I don't know if you guys even know

1271.1 --> 1275.539
about him but

1273.26 --> 1278.539
I used to like kind of be a fan of a guy

1275.539 --> 1280.58
called Jim Bob when he was like friends

1278.539 --> 1283.4
with Owen Benjamin and then it all went

1280.58 --> 1284.78
to [ __ ] and he just became an ultimate

1283.4 --> 1288.2800000000002
gamma

1284.78 --> 1288.28
like really gross

1288.62 --> 1295.52
and he is not happy now like that's a

1292.4 --> 1297.919
regression I fear Dell is right now

1295.52 --> 1300.32
going through that

1297.919 --> 1303.0800000000002
and the problem is when you do it like

1300.32 --> 1304.9399999999998
that and you get nasty

1303.08 --> 1308.36
when you do it

1304.94 --> 1310.9
you don't really recover from that

1308.36 --> 1314.6
you get stuck

1310.9 --> 1317.0
I mean he might at some point now

1314.6 --> 1319.28
realize this at some point I might be

1317.0 --> 1321.799
like okay I'll just drop this whole

1319.28 --> 1324.62
upward arising Earth

1321.799 --> 1326.24
it's just drop it and just like oh hi

1324.62 --> 1327.86
how are you guys doing what do you have

1326.24 --> 1329.84
up now and like act like nothing

1327.86 --> 1332.799
happened well guess what that's not

1329.84 --> 1332.799
gonna work this time

1335.38 --> 1341.5390000000002
and if Dell

1337.46 --> 1344.059
one really wants to amend like

1341.539 --> 1346.4
he's gonna have to apologize to a level

1344.059 --> 1348.7
that I don't think he's actually capable

1346.4 --> 1348.7
of

1349.76 --> 1356.3799999999999
because his ego just refuses to take it

1352.88 --> 1358.2800000000002
I mean he would consider it tactically

1356.38 --> 1360.38
diplomatically like yeah I should have

1358.28 --> 1362.6589999999999
thought but he can't do it he can't get

1360.38 --> 1364.46
himself to do it it was his ego that

1362.659 --> 1369.2600000000002
pulled him in this position in the first

1364.46 --> 1370.22
place and his ego is not gonna take the

1369.26 --> 1372.5
fire

1370.22 --> 1374.84
to get all the way back it's not gonna

1372.5 --> 1378.74
do it so I fear that Dell is actually

1374.84 --> 1382.28
stuck now in a similar situation as

1378.74 --> 1384.6200000000001
where Jim Bob has found himself into

1382.28 --> 1387.26
is not good

1384.62 --> 1389.539
like that's bad for the community a

1387.26 --> 1392.24
person that was there as part of Flat

1389.539 --> 1398.26
Earth that Drew attention

1392.24 --> 1398.26
in his own way is going down that's bad

1398.48 --> 1404.32
yeah we're winning yeah but it's still

1400.7 --> 1404.32
bad it's not good that it happens

1411.98 --> 1414.679
yeah they all came around everybody's

1413.72 --> 1417.4
jet

1414.679 --> 1417.4
that's right

1420.14 --> 1424.039
that was good demonstrations no not

1423.14 --> 1427.3400000000001
really

1424.039 --> 1431.059
I mean it's it's fun

1427.34 --> 1432.3799999999999
like household physics sort of thing

1431.059 --> 1436.82
but

1432.38 --> 1440.24
when he's not actually applying physics

1436.82 --> 1445.9399999999998
properly then it's just kooky wannabe

1440.24 --> 1448.76
science the same ball [ __ ] science

1445.94 --> 1451.94
that are infecting the call that have

1448.76 --> 1453.2
infected Western culture so badly

1451.94 --> 1456.38
right

1453.2 --> 1460.22
it's the same thing it's the same level

1456.38 --> 1462.8200000000002
and it is thus not durable and very

1460.22 --> 1462.82
pointless

1480.28 --> 1483.339
[Music]

1483.62 --> 1488.299
it's wrong that everybody expects the

1485.78 --> 1491.4189999999999
other agree with him well

1488.299 --> 1494.96
you you might be surprised but

1491.419 --> 1497.0
we at fed and myself included don't

1494.96 --> 1500.539
really care

1497.0 --> 1504.14
whether he agrees or not

1500.539 --> 1508.8799999999999
you see this is not about consensus

1504.14 --> 1511.3400000000001
politics this is about factual accuracy

1508.88 --> 1515.44
yeah

1511.34 --> 1515.4399999999998
it's not about agree or disagree

1516.799 --> 1521.4189999999999
is this about factual accuracy

1530.96 --> 1539.059
no less that rdd nonsense oh really so

1535.88 --> 1541.7600000000002
you would like to disprove that relative

1539.059 --> 1545.72
density Theory works

1541.76 --> 1548.0
so perfectly and all encompassing that

1545.72 --> 1549.559
it could be considered a law of nature

1548.0 --> 1553.22
really

1549.559 --> 1555.44
Maximus flatius you want to challenge me

1553.22 --> 1558.82
yeah you're looking you're watching a

1555.44 --> 1561.98
show of the guy that effectively

1558.82 --> 1566.24
mastered and perfected it when it first

1561.98 --> 1568.279
came on the FED scene yeah me and Riley

1566.24 --> 1571.039
we worked it out

1568.279 --> 1573.44
like us together we worked out the

1571.039 --> 1576.32
details of relative density like how it

1573.44 --> 1579.5800000000002
perfectly and fully applies and the

1576.32 --> 1579.58
phrase eologies yeah

1580.46 --> 1584.6000000000001
so

1581.779 --> 1587.779
if you want a challenge

1584.6 --> 1590.9189999999999
the legitimacy of relative density

1587.779 --> 1590.919
Theory I'd like to hear

1591.38 --> 1596.48
yeah so where is relative density

1594.5 --> 1599.299
nonsense exactly

1596.48 --> 1602.84
cannot explain the acceleration yes it

1599.299 --> 1605.6589999999999
can yeah when an object is at this

1602.84 --> 1607.8999999999999
equilibrium density wise with the medium

1605.659 --> 1611.9
a force

1607.9 --> 1616.1000000000001
manifests within the object

1611.9 --> 1618.14
that force causes the object

1616.1 --> 1622.4599999999998
to accelerate

1618.14 --> 1625.76
if it has a maneuverability to do so

1622.46 --> 1628.279
because if it doesn't then instead

1625.76 --> 1631.64
it won't accelerate it will stay in its

1628.279 --> 1635.24
place but exert a force

1631.64 --> 1636.679
through pressure it will use its mass or

1635.24 --> 1640.1
its weight

1636.679 --> 1644.5
its density its overall density to push

1640.1 --> 1649.4599999999998
against the thing that is obstructing

1644.5 --> 1651.799
its acceleration towards its density

1649.46 --> 1655.179
towards its equilibrium density wise

1651.799 --> 1655.179
yeah that's what happens

1655.7 --> 1661.5800000000002
that is what explains the acceleration

1658.94 --> 1663.02
of objects

1661.58 --> 1664.82
passively

1663.02 --> 1666.1399999999999
and pressure

1664.82 --> 1669.1
yeah

1666.14 --> 1669.1000000000001
the full works

1670.159 --> 1677.2
where in the equation does that come in

1673.58 --> 1677.1999999999998
uh it doesn't really

1680.24 --> 1687.559
except well it's an averaged

1683.86 --> 1689.7199999999998
acceleration yeah it's just like oh this

1687.559 --> 1692.779
Force this medium this length yeah

1689.72 --> 1695.539
that's where it kind of comes in then

1692.779 --> 1697.64
roughly but I mean it's just an average

1695.539 --> 1701.539
out though

1697.64 --> 1704.179
I mean if the air is much thicker

1701.539 --> 1706.58
there's more density and there can be

1704.179 --> 1709.46
like a lot of moist right that even

1706.58 --> 1713.36
changes the acceleration rate of things

1709.46 --> 1715.52
and if you drop things in a liquid

1713.36 --> 1717.6789999999999
medium like water

1715.52 --> 1719.12
then there is a different acceleration

1717.679 --> 1720.279
rate

1719.12 --> 1723.4399999999998
because

1720.279 --> 1726.679
effectively well the friction you know

1723.44 --> 1729.1000000000001
it's the friction friction changes the

1726.679 --> 1729.1000000000001
whole thing

1730.22 --> 1737.32
it decreases all of it

1733.46 --> 1737.32
right but yes

1738.38 --> 1744.14
the acceleration rate

1740.48 --> 1748.48
is just what happens when a force

1744.14 --> 1748.48
is acted upon an object

1749.0 --> 1753.32
is this really basic mechanics

1751.4 --> 1756.38
so that's where it comes from right

1753.32 --> 1759.08
relativity density this equilibrium

1756.38 --> 1762.2
Force it's a force it's a force it

1759.08 --> 1764.539
manifests that Force results in this

1762.2 --> 1768.039
legit 9.8

1764.539 --> 1768.039
meters per second squared

1768.559 --> 1773.4189999999999
so there you go there's the cost

1771.559 --> 1776.299
there's there's where that's coming from

1773.419 --> 1778.8200000000002
it's in relative density it's all in

1776.299 --> 1781.039
there it's a force

1778.82 --> 1785.26
how it's a force

1781.039 --> 1787.94
where exactly it manifests what it can

1785.26 --> 1789.3799999999999
manifest into depending on the

1787.94 --> 1791.8400000000001
circumstances

1789.38 --> 1793.7
and I even know about more complex

1791.84 --> 1796.6999999999998
medium in the medium in a medium

1793.7 --> 1799.46
situations yeah because it's all

1796.7 --> 1801.94
completely worked out it's completely

1799.46 --> 1801.94
final

1803.36 --> 1809.819
and simulatable

1805.9 --> 1809.8190000000002
[Music]

1818.12 --> 1824.559
you must be able to predict that number

1821.24 --> 1824.559
with an equation

1828.799 --> 1834.5
oh that's fine look Maximus flatius if

1832.34 --> 1837.6789999999999
you want to use that equation you want

1834.5 --> 1840.919
to go Newtonian well guess what it's

1837.679 --> 1843.2
very simple to do it's very simple yeah

1840.919 --> 1846.64
you take Newtonian mechanics but instead

1843.2 --> 1849.799
of oh there is a universal force field

1846.64 --> 1851.26
that is causing the acceleration there

1849.799 --> 1855.799
is

1851.26 --> 1857.299
sometimes momentary points in which

1855.799 --> 1860.62
there is a relative density this

1857.299 --> 1865.0
equilibrium that causes

1860.62 --> 1868.9399999999998
that acceleration force

1865.0 --> 1870.98
in more or less amounts

1868.94 --> 1873.02
that's the model it's it's the same

1870.98 --> 1874.64
system except there's not a universal

1873.02 --> 1879.1399999999999
field

1874.64 --> 1881.179
it just happens manifests as soon as an

1879.14 --> 1882.44
object is at this equilibrium with its

1881.179 --> 1884.0590000000002
medium

1882.44 --> 1887.1200000000001
there you go

1884.059 --> 1889.22
is completely calculable

1887.12 --> 1892.8799999999999
I'm not gonna do it

1889.22 --> 1895.46
because I freaking hate math but I mean

1892.88 --> 1898.7
I get it enough to see those connections

1895.46 --> 1900.5
and describe them to you in in words

1898.7 --> 1902.419
and you're gonna have to do it yourself

1900.5 --> 1904.76
from that point on because I don't give

1902.419 --> 1907.3990000000001
a [ __ ] about math and I definitely don't

1904.76 --> 1911.179
give a [ __ ] about things having to be

1907.399 --> 1916.4799999999998
calculable using math yeah

1911.179 --> 1916.48
scientific method doesn't require math

1923.799 --> 1929.48
huh

1925.84 --> 1932.36
so yeah it's your own problem dude

1929.48 --> 1934.039
you're all formula addicted that's your

1932.36 --> 1939.6399999999999
freaking problem I described everything

1934.039 --> 1939.64
it works it's full proof literally

1945.74 --> 1951.38
yeah so can we get out of that way that

1948.74 --> 1954.32
yeah that's definitely

1951.38 --> 1955.88
the proof and cause of this alleged

1954.32 --> 1959.72
acceleration

1955.88 --> 1964.5800000000002
with a much more detailed in content and

1959.72 --> 1968.539
result oriented system as in it actually

1964.58 --> 1971.1399999999999
works this one yeah unlike Newtonian

1968.539 --> 1971.14
mechanics

1979.179 --> 1984.2
yeah well I I gave you your math I

1982.399 --> 1986.36
described it

1984.2 --> 1988.3400000000001
I connected it up for you verbally

1986.36 --> 1990.02
you're gonna have to do it yourself if

1988.34 --> 1991.6999999999998
that's not good enough then I will kick

1990.02 --> 1994.46
you the [ __ ] out of my chat because

1991.7 --> 1997.88
you're a [ __ ] wanker

1994.46 --> 2001.0
a math troll [ __ ]

1997.88 --> 2005.0390000000002
probably a baller that's just trying to

2001.0 --> 2005.039
see more friction and [ __ ]

2006.94 --> 2010.14
just so you know

2013.84 --> 2017.399
yo Supreme knowing

2032.32 --> 2035.8799999999999
what right

2039.159 --> 2043.5390000000002
you know previously measured

2040.96 --> 2045.46
acceleration

2043.539 --> 2048.24
yeah by the way you can't technically

2045.46 --> 2054.7200000000003
measure acceleration you can only

2048.24 --> 2054.72
calculate it based on in intervals yeah

2060.159 --> 2065.98
yes [ __ ] I'll I'll kick you out

2063.159 --> 2068.639
right now bring it on show you what kind

2065.98 --> 2073.659
of a [ __ ] you are

2068.639 --> 2075.82
but with your gamma troll spaz yeah do

2073.659 --> 2078.2200000000003
it and I will kick you out just do it

2075.82 --> 2082.8590000000004
now do it now come on

2078.22 --> 2082.859
do it I'm right here do it

2086.08 --> 2088.56
foreign

2098.32 --> 2103.48
glad to see the mystery approach yeah it

2101.02 --> 2106.359
is the mature approach it's called

2103.48 --> 2108.58
mowing the lawn yeah because these troll

2106.359 --> 2110.92
[ __ ] keep popping up in there and

2108.58 --> 2113.0789999999997
I'm just making them pop out so I can

2110.92 --> 2117.06
mow them immediately

2113.079 --> 2117.0600000000004
right so just to get it out of the way

2118.24 --> 2122.4399999999996
right otherwise they're going to sneak

2119.8 --> 2124.96
up on on us and then basically try to

2122.44 --> 2126.339
put me in one corner and uh put me in

2124.96 --> 2128.619
the Hall of Mirrors that's what they do

2126.339 --> 2131.56
that's what you do

2128.619 --> 2132.94
when you give them the room to do that

2131.56 --> 2135.46
to you

2132.94 --> 2138.28
and I have experience with that

2135.46 --> 2141.94
happening even on my show here so I'm

2138.28 --> 2144.8390000000004
going to be a little preemptive about it

2141.94 --> 2144.839
deal with it

2146.079 --> 2151.78
ask hard questions oh heart what hard

2149.38 --> 2153.46
questions I'm sorry was there any hard

2151.78 --> 2156.0600000000004
question that I haven't actually

2153.46 --> 2156.06
answered

2156.76 --> 2161.8590000000004
oh so I didn't give you some stupid

2159.4 --> 2163.96
bunch of numbers and symbols I could do

2161.859 --> 2167.0989999999997
that I can [ __ ] do that how about

2163.96 --> 2167.099
this yeah

2170.45 --> 2173.489
[Music]

2174.46 --> 2179.14
there you go

2176.98 --> 2182.5
so there it is yes your [ __ ] numbers

2179.14 --> 2186.2799999999997
and [ __ ] symbols oh there you go

2182.5 --> 2187.18
[ __ ] yourself [ __ ] you and your [ __ ]

2186.28 --> 2190.5400000000004
math

2187.18 --> 2193.54
and now you get the [ __ ] up

2190.54 --> 2193.54
bye

2195.9 --> 2199.6800000000003
remove that garbage

2200.26 --> 2206.5600000000004
[ __ ] your math yeah

2202.72 --> 2209.02
hey hey guess what math

2206.56 --> 2212.7
it's not physics

2209.02 --> 2216.24
it's not even not physics it doesn't

2212.7 --> 2216.24
physically exist

2216.82 --> 2224.38
yeah it's superfluous

2220.66 --> 2228.04
it's just a little extra

2224.38 --> 2231.4
that you don't need yeah

2228.04 --> 2235.619
you don't really need math

2231.4 --> 2235.619
for science for physics

2237.46 --> 2244.56
yeah because the scientific method

2239.44 --> 2248.38
doesn't have mathematics in it

2244.56 --> 2252.82
oh how dare you are with Scientists

2248.38 --> 2255.52
reality is math is really this yeah yeah

2252.82 --> 2258.6400000000003
yeah but the scientific method isn't

2255.52 --> 2261.099
mathematical though yeah

2258.64 --> 2264.0989999999997
that's why I like it so much it's it's

2261.099 --> 2266.619
kind of I've fallen in love with it

2264.099 --> 2268.48
at a later age

2266.619 --> 2270.339
when I was younger it frustrated me

2268.48 --> 2272.38
enormously because it seemed like it

2270.339 --> 2276.06
would obstruct me but I've really

2272.38 --> 2276.06
learned to love it because

2276.359 --> 2282.8199999999997
it's not mathematical like you can

2279.579 --> 2284.1400000000003
literally get scientific purely through

2282.82 --> 2287.52
description

2284.14 --> 2287.52
and I love that about it

2287.859 --> 2293.7
all right so what a bunch of [ __ ]

2290.26 --> 2298.119
a budget math [ __ ]

2293.7 --> 2300.5789999999997
math is reality and uh let me guess your

2298.119 --> 2302.2000000000003
gender fluid as well

2300.579 --> 2305.099
yeah

2302.2 --> 2305.0989999999997
thought so

2309.94 --> 2315.579
I think we got one of these Muppets

2313.24 --> 2318.7599999999998
math Muppets

2315.579 --> 2321.28
got a whole whole bunch of them

2318.76 --> 2325.2400000000002
fagoty math Muppets

2321.28 --> 2328.1800000000003
yeah well this is not your not your show

2325.24 --> 2331.14
yeah I will kick you out

2328.18 --> 2331.14
very quickly

2336.579 --> 2342.1800000000003
right

2337.66 --> 2345.3999999999996
so let's stick to relative density the

2342.18 --> 2347.68
scientifically proven

2345.4 --> 2350.339
factual system

2347.68 --> 2353.56
that explains perfectly

2350.339 --> 2358.14
acceleration of objects

2353.56 --> 2358.14
and passive displacement overall

2379.78 --> 2382.38
foreign

2385.859 --> 2392.5789999999997
blue pill

2387.94 --> 2392.579
did you know how I did my math exam

2395.38 --> 2400.96
I'll give you one guess

2397.42 --> 2404.98
I didn't study like I didn't study at

2400.96 --> 2408.7
all that like how I did it was like I

2404.98 --> 2411.4
really hope this and that subject is not

2408.7 --> 2413.9199999999996
gonna be brought up because I can't get

2411.4 --> 2415.7200000000003
it and I can't get myself to guess it

2413.92 --> 2419.7400000000002
correctly either

2415.72 --> 2422.6189999999997
yeah I feel still very much got the exam

2419.74 --> 2426.52
though in one go

2422.619 --> 2429.28
yeah you know how I do it pure intuition

2426.52 --> 2431.44
it's the recognition of patterns that

2429.28 --> 2434.5600000000004
has gotten me through math would

2431.44 --> 2437.619
literally we got a lot of multiple uh

2434.56 --> 2440.32
yeah what is it there

2437.619 --> 2442.42
multiple answer type questions multiple

2440.32 --> 2445.9
choice right

2442.42 --> 2449.619
and I would simply wreck I would go

2445.9 --> 2453.52
purely on numerological pattern

2449.619 --> 2457.06
recognition yeah purely intuition I had

2453.52 --> 2460.839
no studies zero Study Hour the day

2457.06 --> 2463.839
before in math zero and zero study hour

2460.839 --> 2468.099
in math overall in like the half year

2463.839 --> 2470.92
that preceded that math exam yeah and I

2468.099 --> 2473.8
still got it that that's how I do math

2470.92 --> 2476.02
I do it purely on pattern recognition I

2473.8 --> 2479.1400000000003
just recognize like hey I know that

2476.02 --> 2482.04
number that number is associated with

2479.14 --> 2482.04
that pattern

2482.44 --> 2486.579
and then it like with multiple choice

2484.78 --> 2490.0600000000004
it's very decently

2486.579 --> 2493.2400000000002
doable to just guess the associated

2490.06 --> 2495.52
pattern like without even understanding

2493.24 --> 2498.04
the very mathematical process in itself

2495.52 --> 2500.74
which a lot I didn't

2498.04 --> 2502.72
it was just like ah

2500.74 --> 2505.5989999999997
freaking

2502.72 --> 2508.839
sinus cosines gave me a headache to no

2505.599 --> 2512.5
end and like I have had it explained but

2508.839 --> 2515.02
it's just it won't stick I hate it

2512.5 --> 2517.72
it frustrates me because I keep getting

2515.02 --> 2519.46
it not right but that was in the exam

2517.72 --> 2524.0989999999997
too and I still

2519.46 --> 2527.7
despite that managed to completely

2524.099 --> 2527.7000000000003
succeed in one go

2529.95 --> 2533.3599999999997
[Music]

2534.16 --> 2540.339
in within math most of what I've done is

2537.52 --> 2542.2
really tried to memorize the patterns so

2540.339 --> 2544.54
the thing that I had really been

2542.2 --> 2546.52
fanatically doing on my own

2544.54 --> 2550.32
but that started in the Waldorf School

2546.52 --> 2552.52
even is like memorize the the

2550.32 --> 2557.5
calculation tables like the

2552.52 --> 2559.599
multiplication tables from 1 to 13.

2557.5 --> 2561.54
I've done that for such a long time

2559.599 --> 2564.82
until like

2561.54 --> 2567.16
I'm not as good as I used to but like I

2564.82 --> 2569.8
would be able to know the number without

2567.16 --> 2573.94
actually calculating it now

2569.8 --> 2575.44
if you ask me I will quickly calculate

2573.94 --> 2577.9
it because I don't know it by heart

2575.44 --> 2580.3
anymore but there was a time where I

2577.9 --> 2583.599
wouldn't calculate it and still know the

2580.3 --> 2586.6600000000003
number because I just knew it I knew the

2583.599 --> 2589.3590000000004
pattern it's like a giant book and I

2586.66 --> 2590.319
would just know it's just like that that

2589.359 --> 2594.22
one

2590.319 --> 2595.839
no actions of cognitive calculation

2594.22 --> 2598.48
happening

2595.839 --> 2600.74
and that's kind of like how I learned

2598.48 --> 2610.599
how I got through math a lot

2600.74 --> 2612.4599999999996
[Music]

2610.599 --> 2614.619
yo

2612.46 --> 2618.9
did you guys take it easy on the back

2614.619 --> 2618.9
and forth I'm having a show here

2644.14 --> 2649.72
what the [ __ ] is going on here let her

2646.48 --> 2651.52
Sage what are you talking about with him

2649.72 --> 2655.0789999999997
it looks like he's a gamma and he's

2651.52 --> 2655.079
trying to pull [ __ ] out of you

2666.099 --> 2669.2400000000002
what is this about

2670.9 --> 2675.819
I do not appreciate

2673.42 --> 2678.4
people getting in my chat to harass

2675.819 --> 2681.819
other people and then completely ignore

2678.4 --> 2684.3
the actual show there's an official rule

2681.819 --> 2684.3
about that

2686.859 --> 2692.2
seems like you specifically came in just

2689.98 --> 2695.44
to [ __ ] with flatter Sage since

2692.2 --> 2697.96
literally like his name is in every

2695.44 --> 2700.0
single chat comment you make are you

2697.96 --> 2703.319
harassing flutter Sage

2700.0 --> 2703.319
Temptation Of Mice

2706.38 --> 2712.7200000000003
the validation of rdd

2709.42 --> 2715.06
yeah it's called the egg experiment yeah

2712.72 --> 2718.1189999999997
Anthony Riley

2715.06 --> 2720.4
empirical validation

2718.119 --> 2722.92
you take an egg

2720.4 --> 2726.2200000000003
put it in water in a column

2722.92 --> 2729.0
you add salt

2726.22 --> 2733.18
to the column of water effectively

2729.0 --> 2735.52
increasing the density of the water

2733.18 --> 2739.98
the egg goes up

2735.52 --> 2739.98
because its density doesn't change

2741.579 --> 2746.1400000000003
yeah

2742.72 --> 2748.54
you altered the independent variable the

2746.14 --> 2751.06
density in this case of the medium you

2748.54 --> 2755.38
altered either density object or medium

2751.06 --> 2759.16
in this case the medium by adding salt

2755.38 --> 2762.1600000000003
the changing of the density ratio

2759.16 --> 2763.48
between the medium and the egg

2762.16 --> 2766.7799999999997
happened

2763.48 --> 2770.579
and thus there is a displacement

2766.78 --> 2770.579
it caused this equilibrium

2774.24 --> 2778.66
it's an experiment who gives a [ __ ]

2776.68 --> 2781.06
about people declaring themselves

2778.66 --> 2783.5789999999997
scientists or not it's not relevant it's

2781.06 --> 2786.64
a scientific experiment in Anthony Riley

2783.579 --> 2790.6800000000003
mastered it he really put it out and he

2786.64 --> 2790.68
was correct and valid

2791.76 --> 2797.26
gravity predicts oh my God

2795.7 --> 2799.96
wow

2797.26 --> 2801.88
I think we got a severely projecting

2799.96 --> 2805.839
[ __ ] in chat here

2801.88 --> 2809.88
oh my God I can't believe after all this

2805.839 --> 2809.88
they still say things like this

2810.339 --> 2816.339
gravity also predicts that the egg goes

2813.28 --> 2817.079
up not sure how relative density proves

2816.339 --> 2820.38
it

2817.079 --> 2820.38
yeah yeah

2823.24 --> 2828.7
you mean gravity which literally you

2826.3 --> 2831.819
can't even describe what it is

2828.7 --> 2834.839
what's gravity Temptation Of Mice your

2831.819 --> 2834.839
baller fucktart

2834.94 --> 2839.26
I can't believe you're that stupid that

2837.099 --> 2841.54
you were actually a baller I did call it

2839.26 --> 2843.3390000000004
though flutter Sage

2841.54 --> 2847.079
all right

2843.339 --> 2847.0789999999997
he is just a [ __ ] wit

2849.63 --> 2853.42
[Music]

2851.68 --> 2856.66
no one knows yeah

2853.42 --> 2858.2400000000002
but gravity is more legit though could

2856.66 --> 2862.839
you please stop deleting your messages

2858.24 --> 2865.9799999999996
Supreme knowing it's agitating

2862.839 --> 2865.98
he said it well enough

2872.319 --> 2877.119
right you're on spelling yeah

2874.839 --> 2879.339
we'll work on it before you press enter

2877.119 --> 2881.079
if you hate your spelling

2879.339 --> 2883.119
then

2881.079 --> 2886.42
do something about it

2883.119 --> 2888.579
prevent pressing enter before you fully

2886.42 --> 2892.14
check your own sentence

2888.579 --> 2892.1400000000003
instead of afterward

2892.18 --> 2896.74
anyway I get it I have the issue too

2894.88 --> 2898.0
sometimes and my keyboard kind of sucks

2896.74 --> 2901.54
it

2898.0 --> 2904.72
periodic intervals so anyway

2901.54 --> 2907.839
yeah yeah relative density has an

2904.72 --> 2910.98
experiment it is a proven valid

2907.839 --> 2913.7799999999997
scientific hypothesis

2910.98 --> 2914.68
anybody can do it is really cheap to do

2913.78 --> 2916.96
it too

2914.68 --> 2918.64
yeah gravity people don't even know what

2916.96 --> 2920.56
it is

2918.64 --> 2923.859
yeah

2920.56 --> 2927.04
I'll bet you

2923.859 --> 2930.24
I'll bet you 20 bucks that you don't

2927.04 --> 2930.24
know what gravity is

2936.52 --> 2940.3
[Music]

2938.26 --> 2942.4
so why don't you

2940.3 --> 2944.5600000000004
put down some

2942.4 --> 2946.599
information yeah I'm not even talking

2944.56 --> 2950.14
about evidence how about just some

2946.599 --> 2951.88
information on on your claim on what you

2950.14 --> 2956.319
think gravity even is

2951.88 --> 2959.88
to say that it is the legit thing and

2956.319 --> 2959.88
not relative density yeah

2962.339 --> 2968.14
yeah why don't you [ __ ] stop talking

2965.2 --> 2970.839
to flatter sage and address me now

2968.14 --> 2974.2599999999998
[ __ ]

2970.839 --> 2978.2999999999997
I'm talking to you [ __ ] why don't you

2974.26 --> 2978.3
[ __ ] unmute and talk to me

2979.9 --> 2986.109
[Music]

2989.22 --> 2992.4399999999996
[Music]

2990.52 --> 2995.68
oh okay

2992.44 --> 2997.599
in that case go [ __ ] yourself

2995.68 --> 3000.319
[ __ ]

2997.599 --> 3000.319
scum

3009.359 --> 3012.7999999999997
so that was that

3016.8 --> 3022.7400000000002
yeah yeah don't go at home

3019.079 --> 3024.6600000000003
it's very simple you don't go at home

3022.74 --> 3027.7999999999997
yeah we're having a discussion about

3024.66 --> 3027.7999999999997
relative density

3031.859 --> 3038.04
versus gravity yeah and then an at-home

3035.4 --> 3040.02
is not a rebuttal

3038.04 --> 3042.8
it's what gets you kicked out

3040.02 --> 3042.8
immediately

3044.16 --> 3047.48
get it [ __ ]

3047.7 --> 3054.0
at home is not a rebuttal it gets you

3050.28 --> 3054.0
kicked out immediately

3056.88 --> 3059.839
all right

3060.78 --> 3064.44
in the meantime I'm gonna

3062.89 --> 3068.24
[Music]

3064.44 --> 3068.2400000000002
down on this Illuminati Castle

3087.54 --> 3092.0589999999997
hey Stevie traveler good to see you

3094.74 --> 3098.66
you arrived in the middle of a troll

3098.72 --> 3105.5589999999997
infestation but

3101.46 --> 3105.559
it's easily taken care of though

3108.599 --> 3114.6800000000003
hi turret yes I noticed you sorry it was

3111.72 --> 3114.68
a little preoccupied

3114.78 --> 3118.46
yes turret

3119.94 --> 3124.38
um

3121.619 --> 3127.339
can you see it

3124.38 --> 3127.339
on the screen

3128.7 --> 3135.3799999999997
yeah I see your name right there on the

3131.94 --> 3135.38
screen yes we can see you

3142.18 --> 3145.35
[Music]

3149.1 --> 3152.17
[Music]

3162.059 --> 3167.059
oh okay fair enough

3176.339 --> 3180.14
um

3177.599 --> 3180.1400000000003
foreign

3197.819 --> 3201.599
yeah so any more

3199.74 --> 3205.319
actual

3201.599 --> 3208.1400000000003
questions about relative density

3205.319 --> 3212.16
or maybe somebody would like to

3208.14 --> 3215.15
bypass the at-home [ __ ] and actually

3212.16 --> 3215.16
tell me what gravity is

3215.15 --> 3216.6600000000003
[Music]

3215.16 --> 3218.819
um

3216.66 --> 3220.68
you should get a discount on Illuminati

3218.819 --> 3222.359
Castle yeah

3220.68 --> 3224.22
unfortunately that's not gonna happen

3222.359 --> 3226.14
though

3224.22 --> 3229.5589999999997
hmm

3226.14 --> 3231.359
sometimes they are at discount

3229.559 --> 3233.46
they just are it's just in the program

3231.359 --> 3235.38
free publicity

3233.46 --> 3237.9
I don't know if they specifically

3235.38 --> 3240.559
appreciate being called Illuminati

3237.9 --> 3240.559
callsanos

3261.42 --> 3264.14
hmm

3264.3 --> 3267.5190000000002
[Music]

3273.42 --> 3280.14
trolls have to try to cause yeah yeah

3276.66 --> 3282.359
yes there it because I suspect it was it

3280.14 --> 3285.0
was actually baller trolls

3282.359 --> 3288.0589999999997
that were with Dell I think a lot of

3285.0 --> 3292.079
bother trolls have actually like

3288.059 --> 3294.42
really gone and set on top of this giant

3292.079 --> 3297.7400000000002
[ __ ] pile that is Dell

3294.42 --> 3297.7400000000002
Dell's Legacy

3298.5 --> 3305.48
and they're like with him now using him

3302.76 --> 3305.48
as

3306.119 --> 3310.1600000000003
as a base vantage point

3310.8 --> 3317.1600000000003
I think baller trolls are actually

3314.4 --> 3319.2000000000003
like pretending to be on the outside and

3317.16 --> 3321.48
[ __ ]

3319.2 --> 3322.859
because they just want everything to

3321.48 --> 3325.98
blow up

3322.859 --> 3328.319
they just wanted all to [ __ ] die

3325.98 --> 3331.5
fall over and die

3328.319 --> 3333.0
or be like a torturously humiliated in

3331.5 --> 3334.859
and commit suicide that's what they

3333.0 --> 3337.559
really want

3334.859 --> 3340.22
and they'll go to any length pretend to

3337.559 --> 3340.2200000000003
be anything

3340.92 --> 3345.66
pretend to be on anybody's side just to

3343.5 --> 3347.819
try to forward that agenda because

3345.66 --> 3351.0589999999997
they're [ __ ] demonically possessed

3347.819 --> 3353.7
and they have absolutely no life

3351.059 --> 3355.1400000000003
and that coming from me is like pretty

3353.7 --> 3358.7999999999997
wild

3355.14 --> 3361.2599999999998
because I admit at times like I don't

3358.8 --> 3364.7400000000002
really have too much of a life

3361.26 --> 3367.5200000000004
but at least I'm not that

3364.74 --> 3367.52
you know

3379.14 --> 3384.1189999999997
the difference you see with between me

3381.54 --> 3386.099
and those types of trolls is that I

3384.119 --> 3388.7400000000002
could get a life

3386.099 --> 3390.54
I have the capability to actually do

3388.74 --> 3393.7799999999997
that and work on it

3390.54 --> 3396.839
they are always going to be those really

3393.78 --> 3397.8
[ __ ] up nasty demonic little pieces of

3396.839 --> 3400.74
[ __ ]

3397.8 --> 3402.78
that know really nothing but hatred

3400.74 --> 3405.54
when it comes down to it

3402.78 --> 3408.2400000000002
they feign positive emotions probably

3405.54 --> 3412.2799999999997
most of the time

3408.24 --> 3412.2799999999997
those people are never gonna get alive

3413.22 --> 3417.0589999999997
they can't

3415.079 --> 3418.8590000000004
that's probably why they're like that

3417.059 --> 3423.5
because there's nothing left for them

3418.859 --> 3423.5
other than to do that

3452.46 --> 3456.469
what

3453.19 --> 3456.469
[Music]

3456.74 --> 3462.7799999999997
the Juicy Juice what are you talking

3459.359 --> 3465.38
about Zach what

3462.78 --> 3465.38
hmm

3467.76 --> 3474.079
Jaren has never been on the flatter side

3471.18 --> 3474.0789999999997
I don't know

3475.5 --> 3479.94
I think he has

3477.48 --> 3483.68
he's just

3479.94 --> 3483.68
I don't know become this

3484.619 --> 3492.8
it's just good old-fashioned corruption

3489.0 --> 3492.8
just personality corruption

3512.9 --> 3516.859
trolls on both sides

3516.9 --> 3521.94
I'm sorry but you're gonna have to deal

3519.0 --> 3524.18
with the flat earthers being trolls

3521.94 --> 3524.18
yourself

3524.94 --> 3531.38
I mean the people that typically do that

3527.28 --> 3531.38
they don't come around here

3540.599 --> 3544.2000000000003
yeah there's trolls everywhere but I

3542.819 --> 3547.38
mean

3544.2 --> 3548.5789999999997
just because a troll might be a flat

3547.38 --> 3550.26
Earth that doesn't mean I'm gonna give

3548.579 --> 3553.04
them a pass

3550.26 --> 3553.0400000000004
personally

3553.2 --> 3557.96
what about reichi

3555.18 --> 3557.96
I don't know

3565.26 --> 3569.8190000000004
I think reichi I really think reichi is

3568.38 --> 3572.4
just kind of seeing all of this as a

3569.819 --> 3575.119
hobby she's not taking as it as serious

3572.4 --> 3575.119
and fanatical

3575.64 --> 3582.24
as we at fpd are that's what I think I

3579.24 --> 3584.9399999999996
think that Richie is just doing whatever

3582.24 --> 3587.04
I mean she never goes at home I think

3584.94 --> 3589.68
it's just literally a hobby and maybe

3587.04 --> 3593.299
it's her way to kind of like

3589.68 --> 3593.299
hang around boys or something

3595.02 --> 3597.619
so

3601.14 --> 3606.7799999999997
great she is green yeah perhaps

3604.5 --> 3611.48
does seem like it a bit

3606.78 --> 3611.48
but I mean it's I don't really care

3612.24 --> 3616.9199999999996
I mean Dell's doing a lot more damage

3614.339 --> 3619.2599999999998
than reichi rage is just I think he's

3616.92 --> 3623.359
like being protective or something she's

3619.26 --> 3623.3590000000004
just like oh but it has support she just

3623.64 --> 3628.7
doesn't take the scientific method as

3626.28 --> 3628.7000000000003
serious

3630.54 --> 3633.619
I don't know what it is

3639.839 --> 3643.859
but look I don't even know who reichi

3642.78 --> 3645.2400000000002
really is

3643.859 --> 3648.48
do you

3645.24 --> 3650.66
have you ever actually seen reichi on

3648.48 --> 3650.66
camera

3655.44 --> 3662.52
they get to see some picture but

3658.92 --> 3665.94
I mean there is an argument

3662.52 --> 3668.599
that well we don't even know if she even

3665.94 --> 3668.599
is a woman

3670.14 --> 3675.24
you have seen a camera where where

3673.98 --> 3679.76
when

3675.24 --> 3679.7599999999998
logical conclusion that that's just a

3680.579 --> 3687.02
where and when where is it

3683.64 --> 3687.02
and how do you know it sir

3688.74 --> 3693.0789999999997
was she talking while she was on camera

3694.68 --> 3698.04
debating oh

3698.579 --> 3701.2400000000002
okay

3703.04 --> 3706.22
all right

3706.98 --> 3713.42
fair enough I wasn't really a big fan of

3709.559 --> 3713.42
the idea either but

3715.98 --> 3723.02
and it's like okay yeah gross

3719.359 --> 3723.02
she wants to do that

3723.66 --> 3726.2599999999998
hmm

3739.74 --> 3742.339
all right

3743.46 --> 3746.46
hmm

3748.079 --> 3750.5
oh

3767.94 --> 3773.0
yeah she is indeed very young looking

3774.9 --> 3777.079
thank you

3788.28 --> 3792.619
someone has to be now that's pretty real

3796.14 --> 3801.0589999999997
but thanks I didn't know that

3798.359 --> 3805.02
I know I know now I can leave that silly

3801.059 --> 3807.98
conspiracy a theory behind I didn't

well that's not a way to enter this chat

3868.98 --> 3872.119
get the [ __ ] up

it doesn't even matter whether you're

immediately kick you out yeah

3914.099 --> 3921.48

yeah Gammas are not welcome in my chat

3924.299 --> 3928.859

3926.94 --> 3932.88
upon your entry

3928.859 --> 3935.819
I will immediately kick you out

3932.88 --> 3939.319

3949.859 --> 3955.5
to actually learn to behave like a

trolls day

3982.76 --> 3987.38
it looks like it a bit yeah

3989.52 --> 3993.2
or maybe it's like the full moon

3993.359 --> 3998.88
although I think it's like past full

3996.359 --> 4002.2599999999998
moon I'm not sure it was a pretty big

3998.88 --> 4002.26
full moon yesterday I thought

4011.119 --> 4017.319
oh [ __ ] off

4014.72 --> 4017.319

4026.09 --> 4029.199
[Music]

4033.14 --> 4038.839
yeah it's not at 95 percent

4036.98 --> 4042.339
so it's

4038.839 --> 4042.339
it's just decreasing

4044.119 --> 4049.4
yeah it's decreasing yeah so I totally

4046.88 --> 4052.039
got it was probably pretty much full

4049.4 --> 4055.76
moon yesterday or the day before

4052.039 --> 4059.119
and was hey it was in the air

4055.76 --> 4061.28
by the way that's the best time

4059.119 --> 4062.96
right right after the full moon starts

4061.28 --> 4064.28
to decrease that's usually the time when

4062.96 --> 4065.299
there's the most productive energy

4064.28 --> 4068.6800000000003
around

4065.299 --> 4068.68
ever took notice of that

4070.579 --> 4076.4
it can also be during a full moon but

4073.64 --> 4077.839
during a full moon often things get out

4076.4 --> 4080.839
of control

4077.839 --> 4082.7599999999998
typically tends to do especially if

4080.839 --> 4085.119
people that aren't super guarded against

4082.76 --> 4085.119
that

4085.7 --> 4091.0989999999997
but it's always like after the moon has

4088.16 --> 4092.7799999999997
been full that I always get like my my

4091.099 --> 4095.5
wisest

4092.78 --> 4095.5
visions

4103.699 --> 4107.839

block all these centers

4107.839 --> 4112.04
this centers

4109.759 --> 4114.98
no I'll block them even if they do agree

4112.04 --> 4117.739
with me it's about their attitude not

4114.98 --> 4119.718999999999
whether they are on my side agreeing or

4117.739 --> 4121.879999999999

[Music]

4392.96 --> 4398.78
yeah by the way I think also I've

4397.1 --> 4400.280000000001
I've been drinking a lot of Gusto

4398.78 --> 4403.88
recently

4400.28 --> 4405.8
but I think that its influence which is

4403.88 --> 4408.92
caffeine

4405.8 --> 4411.4400000000005
might be detrimental and might have a

4408.92 --> 4413.54
direct relation to when I get really

4411.44 --> 4417.219
issues with my arm

4413.54 --> 4417.219
that's why I'm not getting it today

4418.52 --> 4423.5
I had a lot of issues with it yesterday

4420.62 --> 4426.64
and it really felt like it it partially

4423.5 --> 4426.64
was because of it

4426.86 --> 4430.099999999999
right

4428.6 --> 4432.26
so I'm gonna stop

4430.1 --> 4434.2390000000005
drinking it even though I really like it

4432.26 --> 4438.08
most of the summer the really sunny

4434.239 --> 4441.678999999999
summer is over anyway it seems

4438.08 --> 4444.679
and then hopefully this muscle issue

4441.679 --> 4446.78
will go away completely and I'm really

4444.679 --> 4449.179
gonna test that I'm gonna see if that

4446.78 --> 4452.12
really happens

4449.179 --> 4455.42
and if so then I know that's like yeah I

4452.12 --> 4456.92
mean caffeine if it is really because of

4455.42 --> 4459.4400000000005
the caffeine that it's getting so

4456.92 --> 4461.96
painful

4459.44 --> 4464.5
well then caffeine is like really [ __ ]

4461.96 --> 4464.5
up for me

4467.179 --> 4472.34
in all forms just in any form it's bad

4470.96 --> 4476.02
then

4472.34 --> 4476.02
if this is because of caffeine

4489.02 --> 4491.7390000000005
right

4496.159 --> 4500.78
too much rookola can cause nerval side

4499.52 --> 4504.26
effects

4500.78 --> 4507.44
well what is too much I mean

4504.26 --> 4511.179
it's not like I'm eating like a gigantic

4507.44 --> 4511.178999999999
bag or something about of it

4512.48 --> 4518.54
I doubt that I'm being poisoned by it

4515.78 --> 4522.699
and any nervable side effects it seems

4518.54 --> 4522.699
to have seems to be extremely positive

4522.86 --> 4525.699
so

4527.3 --> 4531.04
I don't think it's arugula

4618.5 --> 4624.56
I believe you that there might be if but

4620.9 --> 4628.5199999999995
like what is actually considered access

4624.56 --> 4631.580000000001
I mean what I take is that access

4628.52 --> 4633.4400000000005

4757.46 --> 4763.78
mean I showed up in 2016 and like

4759.92 --> 4763.78
immediately put myself out there

4764.06 --> 4767.84
it was Mountain I knew that was gonna

4765.92 --> 4768.72

4799.28 --> 4802.719
well maybe

I know that caffeine and I knew that

4807.739 --> 4813.379999999999
through the coffee and even the tea had

4810.26 --> 4816.320000000001
influences on my muscles themselves like

4813.38 --> 4818.3
my muscles would get sore and like eh

4816.32 --> 4821.0599999999995
cramped like that would become more

4818.3 --> 4823.219
stiff and it just

4821.06 --> 4825.38
all kinds of issues that's what I knew

4823.219 --> 4829.06
from caffeine and it seems like that's

4825.38 --> 4829.06
exactly what's happening again

4829.88 --> 4835.1
so when I drank Gusto I never when I

4833.78 --> 4837.199
started drinking that again this summer

4835.1 --> 4840.02
I didn't really realize that it was

4837.199 --> 4842.5
caffeinated I was just like yay I want

4840.02 --> 4842.5
this drink

4842.54 --> 4846.8
and then recently I realized weight is

4844.699 --> 4848.78
actually high in caffeine this is

4846.8 --> 4850.96
probably not gonna work out on the long

4848.78 --> 4850.96
run

4853.159 --> 4859.5199999999995
so I think I just filled up my as much

4856.64 --> 4862.52
as I can handle of that stuff

4859.52 --> 4863.900000000001
and my it's got starting to really tired

4862.52 --> 4865.88
on my body and that's what I think is

4863.9 --> 4867.739
happening and that's why I think I have

4865.88 --> 4869.179
the shoulder thing it's Pro it's

4867.739 --> 4870.5
basically deciding like yes stop

4869.179 --> 4872.54
drinking that

4870.5 --> 4875.5
it was really cool and all but you need

4872.54 --> 4875.5
to stop drinking that

4876.739 --> 4882.0199999999995
so that's what I'm gonna do

4879.8 --> 4886.719
why does the caffeine only seem yeah

4882.02 --> 4886.719
I've wondered that steamy traveler but

4886.88 --> 4893.36
my all the muscles here like this entire

4890.719 --> 4896.78
arm is like

4893.36 --> 4899.42
in way better condition than my arm on

4896.78 --> 4902.0599999999995
the right side overall

4899.42 --> 4905.3
I've trained this arm very extensive

4902.06 --> 4907.580000000001
like with a lot of muscle like if my

4905.3 --> 4910.76
this arm is just much stronger

4907.58 --> 4913.54
I can do things with it that I can't

4910.76 --> 4916.84
effectively do with my other arm

4913.54 --> 4919.159
and it may be because of that

4916.84 --> 4921.64
well-maintained condition that I just

4919.159 --> 4924.5
don't have issues on this side

4921.64 --> 4926.54
very rarely

4924.5 --> 4929.84
it's like it it feels like it's all

4926.54 --> 4931.58
perfectly in place on the other side

4929.84 --> 4934.34
a lot of the times it feels like

4931.58 --> 4938.5
something is slightly wrong

4934.34 --> 4938.5
that's the nuisance of it

4940.1 --> 4944.96
and when I get like

4941.96 --> 4946.94
rib issues like a rib muscle spasm or

4944.96 --> 4950.679
something all that's always on the left

4946.94 --> 4950.678999999999
side always has been by the way

4954.32 --> 4959.239
most of the time not always they have

4957.38 --> 4961.76
had issues with the right side but that

4959.239 --> 4963.98
was like when I was a teen it's not the

4961.76 --> 4967.46
periodic thing

4963.98 --> 4969.94
the way I drink a lot of water no not

4967.46 --> 4969.94
really

4970.88 --> 4974.4400000000005
I drink a lot of minty

4983.239 --> 4987.379999999999
trying to quit drinking beer yeah it can

4985.4 --> 4989.86
be tough especially if you're enjoying

4987.38 --> 4989.86
it a lot

4990.86 --> 4993.46
all right

4999.02 --> 5004.06
right but anyway

5001.36 --> 5007.12
thanks for thinking along but I think I

5004.06 --> 5009.64
can figure it out and handle this

5007.12 --> 5012.46
situation of me

5009.64 --> 5014.56
I'm pretty sure that the majority of the

5012.46 --> 5015.46
influence that's called that's caused

5014.56 --> 5018.219
this

5015.46 --> 5020.38
is because of the Gusto energy drink

5018.219 --> 5022.9
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take

5020.38 --> 5026.08
that out of the diet now

5022.9 --> 5027.879999999999
and then see what happens if it

5026.08 --> 5031.8
completely recedes

5027.88 --> 5031.8
and then I'm gonna draw my conclusion

5032.38 --> 5038.04
so I I don't feel I need more tips thank

5035.8 --> 5038.04
you

5039.699 --> 5045.659
enjoy drinking beer but it depletes

5041.56 --> 5045.659000000001
energy yeah yeah that happens

5047.92 --> 5052.54
and that's why I don't drink it anymore

5049.659 --> 5053.92
because sometimes I am like yeah I want

5052.54 --> 5056.0199999999995
to have a bit of Joy but then I know

5053.92 --> 5059.46
it's like yeah but I'll pay more than

5056.02 --> 5059.46
I'm actually getting out of it

5061.96 --> 5068.219
mrides like drinking when you're alone

5064.06 --> 5068.219
is is really kind of [ __ ] lame anyway

5073.62 --> 5082.48
[Music]

5079.719 --> 5085.42
bad posture

5082.48 --> 5088.36
yeah well that's when it goes really

5085.42 --> 5090.6990000000005
wrong that's when you're like ah you're

5088.36 --> 5093.94
like locked or whatever like you didn't

5090.699 --> 5096.94
you slept in an improper posture right

5093.94 --> 5098.919999999999
that sort of thing yeah that but that's

5096.94 --> 5100.9
not what this is though I am still

5098.92 --> 5101.6990000000005
flexible it's just like something is

5100.9 --> 5106.0
like

5101.699 --> 5108.339999999999
it's not because of a bad posture

5106.0 --> 5110.8
because that goes to yeah that's much

5108.34 --> 5113.04
more painful and crippling when that

5110.8 --> 5113.04
happens

5123.28 --> 5126.5199999999995
it's really great you gave up on

5124.78 --> 5128.739
drinking yeah thanks and it was

5126.52 --> 5131.5
necessary too

5128.739 --> 5133.299999999999
because I mean it was like getting a

5131.5 --> 5135.34
bigger detriment than

5133.3 --> 5137.679
like

5135.34 --> 5140.08
even the amount of joy that I would get

5137.679 --> 5142.179
out of the drinking itself just started

5140.08 --> 5144.64
to die down and when that happens it's

5142.179 --> 5147.4
like yes crew back I mean if I if I

5144.64 --> 5149.38
can't even get the the moment of joy out

5147.4 --> 5151.36
of it anymore then why the hell am I

5149.38 --> 5153.400000000001
even drinking at all

5151.36 --> 5157.719
there's just a bunch of detriments then

5153.4 --> 5160.12
right so it was really it was just time

5157.719 --> 5163.32
it was time to be done with it

5160.12 --> 5163.32
this January

5164.61 --> 5167.8099999999995
[Music]

5168.58 --> 5172.48
and the funniest thing even about it was

5170.679 --> 5175.6
is that

5172.48 --> 5177.759999999999
I hadn't really like even planned to do

5175.6 --> 5180.34
it

5177.76 --> 5182.679
it was just like from in a period of a

5180.34 --> 5184.659000000001
week that I was just like yeah I'm just

5182.679 --> 5187.0
stopping

5184.659 --> 5188.92
it was really like almost an intuitive

5187.0 --> 5191.38
like I'm on I'm on the brakes like my

5188.92 --> 5193.4800000000005
body's like yeah you got to stop it you

5191.38 --> 5194.86
just stop it just stop it

5193.48 --> 5197.08
it would be great

5194.86 --> 5199.98
I'm like oh okay

5197.08 --> 5199.98
sure

5202.9 --> 5208.48
and yeah I've been doing a lot better

5204.94 --> 5210.339999999999
since really if I have to be honest

5208.48 --> 5212.62
all these three hour shows that would

5210.34 --> 5216.360000000001
have never even worked

5212.62 --> 5216.36
when I was still drinking beer daily

5220.36 --> 5227.219
tolerance build up more booze yeah and

5223.48 --> 5227.218999999999
then more bad side effects

5232.06 --> 5235.1990000000005
great self-control

5237.06 --> 5243.400000000001
well it's just like this it's just like

5240.46 --> 5245.699
you know it it wasn't even about self it

5243.4 --> 5248.259999999999
was about realization

5245.699 --> 5251.86
self-control well I wasn't like trying

5248.26 --> 5254.1990000000005
to escape reality as in like I'm going

5251.86 --> 5256.719
to ignore that this beard technically

5254.199 --> 5259.0599999999995
doesn't even work anymore

5256.719 --> 5261.88
but still get any bad side effects I'm

5259.06 --> 5264.820000000001
going to ignore that in the pretense

5261.88 --> 5267.1
like everything is just fine and I can

5264.82 --> 5270.28
keep doing this and I will feel good for

5267.1 --> 5273.04
it like no

5270.28 --> 5275.5599999999995
no I was definitely noticing that like

5273.04 --> 5277.12
it wasn't working anymore so why even

5275.56 --> 5279.52
try then

5277.12 --> 5282.639
and like if you actually quit you'll

5279.52 --> 5285.280000000001
probably feel better more cleared up

5282.639 --> 5286.78
and yeah be a better person because of

5285.28 --> 5289.179
it so it's just like okay I'm just doing

5286.78 --> 5292.0599999999995
it why not

5289.179 --> 5295.36
and it for me now it's it's not even

5292.06 --> 5297.1
like no Arwin better and don't don't

5295.36 --> 5299.44
look at that bear don't look at it and

5297.1 --> 5301.2390000000005
I'm like oh no I can look at it and I

5299.44 --> 5302.5599999999995
can even think like oh yeah maybe I

5301.239 --> 5304.659
could take a beer

5302.56 --> 5306.88
but I'm not doing it

5304.659 --> 5309.04
it's like yeah but if there's like

5306.88 --> 5311.26
suddenly I got invited somewhere to a

5309.04 --> 5314.04
party I mean like that's ever gonna

5311.26 --> 5314.04
happen anymore

5314.38 --> 5319.0
then if I get invited yeah I'd actually

5317.199 --> 5322.54
be like yeah

5319.0 --> 5324.699
let me get one of those beers or two

5322.54 --> 5325.96
maybe and bring it to that party because

5324.699 --> 5328.12
they're probably not gonna get any

5325.96 --> 5330.58
organic beer then I'd want to have a

5328.12 --> 5333.639
beer with other people having a drink

5330.58 --> 5336.88
and I'd be like yeah this is awesome

5333.639 --> 5338.62
like that's fun and it's not like a

5336.88 --> 5341.26
daily thing then

5338.62 --> 5343.659
and it's not alone so I'm not like

5341.26 --> 5346.719
forbidding myself to drink beer it's

5343.659 --> 5350.32
like oh strict alcoholic diet like

5346.719 --> 5351.639
you're off it no no it's just like I

5350.32 --> 5354.699
just

5351.639 --> 5357.400000000001
faced reality about what it was doing to

5354.699 --> 5360.159
me and then quit and then just like I'm

5357.4 --> 5363.219
done with this habit I'm not doing it as

5360.159 --> 5365.86
a habit anymore and that worked like it

5363.219 --> 5367.96
really worked my my body my spirit it

5365.86 --> 5370.36
was all ready for it too right it wasn't

5367.96 --> 5372.159
like who are when all you had to make so

5370.36 --> 5374.259999999999
much effort no it was it was just like

5372.159 --> 5376.179
it was ready it was ready to do that

5374.26 --> 5379.4800000000005
it's like

5376.179 --> 5381.46
it was almost Auto violent it really was

5379.48 --> 5383.62
I mean I'd love to take the credit for

5381.46 --> 5385.54
stopping drinking like a brutal struggle

5383.62 --> 5387.46
that I finally succeeded but it was no

5385.54 --> 5392.219
it was just it was the moment it was

5387.46 --> 5392.219
just no it just stopped just like that

5394.84 --> 5399.82
and I feel lucky I feel lucky that it

5397.36 --> 5401.86
was that easy I think I really feel I

5399.82 --> 5404.44
did get it like a bonus from God or

5401.86 --> 5406.36
something that it was that easy

5404.44 --> 5409.419999999999
because I know with other people out

5406.36 --> 5411.58
there that can be really gruesome for

5409.42 --> 5413.4400000000005
them really really tough to get off it

5411.58 --> 5416.5
like their ego is gonna [ __ ] them up

5413.44 --> 5418.36
over it well I didn't have that trouble

5416.5 --> 5421.38
thankfully

5418.36 --> 5421.38

then don't don't feel like you're being

5525.159 --> 5529.299999999999
left out or something like oh you have

5526.9 --> 5530.5
to be a non-drinker no no don't worry

5529.3 --> 5533.139
about it

5530.5 --> 5534.04
I mean I wouldn't expect drunken bullet

5533.139 --> 5536.4400000000005
uh

5534.04 --> 5538.199
not be drunk when he gets in the chat

5536.44 --> 5542.919999999999
when he does

5538.199 --> 5545.759999999999
seems to be his thing or something but

5542.92 --> 5545.76
if you're

5545.8 --> 5550.860000000001
if you're doing it or you're doing your

5547.54 --> 5550.86
best I really applaud it

5552.52 --> 5556.900000000001
it's like

5554.139 --> 5559.54
if somebody is is nice with it then I

5556.9 --> 5561.879999999999
might accept people drink

5559.54 --> 5564.76
even around me

5561.88 --> 5566.62
but I will never like go get to a

5564.76 --> 5568.780000000001
position where I'm like yeah I'm Cur

5566.62 --> 5570.219
encouraging it like ah yeah man just go

5568.78 --> 5572.86
have fun drink

5570.219 --> 5576.0
when you're not a drinker

5572.86 --> 5576.0
I would never do that

5576.94 --> 5581.759999999999
just as I don't do that with smoking

5590.86 --> 5595.839999999999
I mean I do smoke every day but I don't

5593.56 --> 5599.38
talk about it every day

5595.84 --> 5602.82
and I'm not super enthusiastic about it

5599.38 --> 5602.82
I'm like content

5604.42 --> 5608.58
which is a pretty good position to be in

5612.94 --> 5618.239
but I definitely don't encourage it in

5615.82 --> 5618.239
others

5626.02 --> 5630.580000000001
I'm going to give it try it we're

5628.06 --> 5633.219
drinking before it goes

5630.58 --> 5636.179
both wow okay that's tough duck dude

5633.219 --> 5636.179
well good luck with that

5638.86 --> 5643.5
stop smoking for a long period yeah

5649.36 --> 5654.659
when I was with my ex I was pretty much

5651.46 --> 5654.659
completely smoke free

5662.86 --> 5667.179
smoking has become extreme next week

5664.84 --> 5670.659000000001
yeah no [ __ ]

5667.179 --> 5673.62
yeah not not just a little expensive it

5670.659 --> 5673.62
is quite insane

5676.02 --> 5680.860000000001
although to be fair there's like other

5679.06 --> 5684.1
countries it's even more expensive

5680.86 --> 5685.839999999999
apparently tobacco is like even more

5684.1 --> 5688.8
expensive in England

5685.84 --> 5688.8
crazy [ __ ]

5692.199 --> 5698.199
forty dollars a pack dude

5694.96 --> 5701.86
if they keep it up eventually like

5698.199 --> 5705.419999999999
gold will be more expensive

5701.86 --> 5705.42
in weight than tobacco

5706.06 --> 5712.6
because of the taxes it's like yeah this

5708.1 --> 5712.6
is 99.999 tax

5719.26 --> 5722.820000000001
or you could just

5723.34 --> 5729.2390000000005
make it yourself and then get it dirt

5725.98 --> 5729.239
cheap and organic

5733.84 --> 5739.32
or import the raw leaf and then you get

5736.239 --> 5739.32
none of those taxes

5739.6 --> 5744.179
I'd love to make an order like that

5741.4 --> 5744.179
again by the way

5747.1 --> 5750.1
foreign

5761.56 --> 5766.620000000001
losing 30 pounds that's a lot

5773.32 --> 5778.0599999999995
nice yeah me personally I don't have

5775.6 --> 5781.3
like weight issues

5778.06 --> 5784.179
I get like motivation and spirit issues

5781.3 --> 5788.159000000001
when I'm not doing great I don't get fat

5784.179 --> 5788.159
it's like my spirit gets fat

5788.199 --> 5793.9
like in a not good way unhealthy fat

5791.56 --> 5797.080000000001
but I just don't I don't really get fat

5793.9 --> 5799.0599999999995
I've never really been fat

5797.08 --> 5802.5
even in times where I was really like

5799.06 --> 5802.5
stuffing myself with [ __ ]

5804.28 --> 5809.759999999999
and it's just like no I just I don't get

5807.4 --> 5809.759999999999

6602.159 --> 6606.259999999999
man he's really gone downhill then

6607.56 --> 6612.6

6609.6 --> 6615.0
because I if I remember correct we had a

6612.6 --> 6617.42
stroke like a while ago like last year

6615.0 --> 6617.42
or something

6617.76 --> 6623.52
and then he was pretty good you said so

6621.3 --> 6626.84
did he have another one or did it just

6623.52 --> 6626.84
suddenly go downhill what happened

6629.52 --> 6634.52
seizure started last month ah Christ

6651.54 --> 6654.08
foreign

6655.92 --> 6662.46

6658.679 --> 6665.219
better and recovers somewhat

6662.46 --> 6668.179
but yeah as you said that doesn't really

6665.219 --> 6668.179
sound good if you

6669.719 --> 6673.46
if they're that disoriented

6695.94 --> 6700.799999999999
