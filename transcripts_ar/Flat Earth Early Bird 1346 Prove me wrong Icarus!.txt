101.119 --> 104.079
so

101.92 --> 107.6
yeah the weather

104.079 --> 110.96
still very similar to yesterday

107.6 --> 115.28
just clouded overall

110.96 --> 116.63999999999999
a little bit of rain here and there but

115.28 --> 120.88
not a lot

116.64 --> 120.88
and yeah it's cooled down even more

124.159 --> 128.239
and yeah hearing plenty of sneezing

126.32 --> 130.56
going on because of that it usually

128.239 --> 133.68
happens i mean when things suddenly cool

130.56 --> 135.2
down and then it goes quick

133.68 --> 139.36
people

135.2 --> 139.35999999999999
do start sneezing including myself

141.44 --> 143.84
uh

148.16 --> 151.16
right

156.08 --> 159.68
oh

156.879 --> 161.51899999999998
that's gone up back a bit

159.68 --> 164.64000000000001
last time i checked it was 18 degrees

161.519 --> 164.64000000000001
but now it's 21.

166.8 --> 171.239
that seems very cool off

171.68 --> 176.8
anyway hello voynich first in chat good

174.319 --> 176.79999999999998
to see you

177.92 --> 184.44
it is saturday the

179.76 --> 184.44
27th of august 2022

186.159 --> 189.159
uh

202.879 --> 207.51899999999998
i think i might be still in the middle

204.4 --> 211.519
of like sort of a summer

207.519 --> 214.799
transition phase now or something just

211.519 --> 214.799
easily distracted

219.519 --> 223.20000000000002
i'm especially noticing just like my

221.76 --> 226.319
metabolism

223.2 --> 227.76
because well i sweat sweated a lot

226.319 --> 229.599
during the summer

227.76 --> 232.319
and now things have cooled down and now

229.599 --> 234.48
whenever i basically go out and move i

232.319 --> 238.0
just sweat excessively it's like my body

234.48 --> 238.959
is still thinking it's summer

238.0 --> 241.2
and

238.959 --> 244.31900000000002
this is one of those things those

241.2 --> 246.159
mechanisms that's probably now getting

244.319 --> 248.56
tinkered at

246.159 --> 252.56
on my inner system

248.56 --> 254.56
to transition that to autumn

252.56 --> 256.4
where you basically don't sweat

254.56 --> 258.88
excessively anymore because you don't

256.4 --> 261.88
really need to cool off that badly

258.88 --> 261.88
right

270.56 --> 276.639
last saturday invited

273.12 --> 278.32
for you to flat earth is over

276.639 --> 281.32
wait do you mean over to your house

278.32 --> 281.32
voynich

284.639 --> 289.36
or like to an online hangout what do you

287.12 --> 289.36
mean

289.68 --> 293.199
to your house okay cool

293.919 --> 297.84
i'm glad that worked out

315.039 --> 319.28
all right hey by the way voynich

317.52 --> 320.639
i haven't seen you around here for a

319.28 --> 322.0
while

320.639 --> 324.88
what do you think of my hangout

322.0 --> 326.8
yesterday and the title i thought that

324.88 --> 329.6
would probably be

326.8 --> 333.96000000000004
peaking your interest a bit

329.6 --> 333.96000000000004
and now you popped up what a coincidence

356.8 --> 361.039
for also seth willeberg what

363.44 --> 367.52
you are oh okay

365.12 --> 369.68
you liked it a lot okay cool

367.52 --> 369.68
but

369.919 --> 375.28
in the sense that you agreed with it you

372.479 --> 377.75899999999996
think it's a reasonable

375.28 --> 377.75899999999996
theory

378.96 --> 385.12
because it's relatively simple in its

382.639 --> 385.12
setup

385.44 --> 387.68
right

387.919 --> 394.15999999999997
and like i said then like they just they

390.96 --> 398.79999999999995
would have had to do that

394.16 --> 401.52000000000004
because of the resolute nature of hitler

398.8 --> 401.52000000000004
the real one

403.039 --> 406.479
they just had to do that

407.039 --> 412.71999999999997
right and we see this sort of [ __ ] in

409.28 --> 414.71999999999997
modern times a lot as well

412.72 --> 416.96000000000004
right they've pushed so hard

414.72 --> 420.639
psychologically on certain groups so

416.96 --> 423.84
irrational so hypocritical it's just

420.639 --> 423.84000000000003
they do that on purpose

425.199 --> 427.52000000000004
anyway

433.599 --> 438.4
and also it does provide a bit of a

436.56 --> 440.72
potential

438.4 --> 443.039
good schism a

440.72 --> 445.36
splitting up of understanding for a lot

443.039 --> 448.08
of people that are like well let's just

445.36 --> 450.16
say really into hitler or something

448.08 --> 452.15999999999997
right and that might have dragged them

450.16 --> 454.24
off in all kinds of directions including

452.16 --> 457.52000000000004
pretty dark ones

454.24 --> 461.12
so everybody gets

457.52 --> 462.84
well what if that was a trick like if

461.12 --> 465.759
you really

462.84 --> 468.63899999999995
liked something about hitler like the

465.759 --> 470.319
earlier phase

468.639 --> 472.639
well

470.319 --> 475.199
then to just assume it would always

472.639 --> 477.84000000000003
progress to all that

475.199 --> 479.28000000000003
as one person is like a faulty

477.84 --> 482.96
assumption

479.28 --> 484.87899999999996
so like why would you accept that

482.96 --> 487.35999999999996
that transition

484.879 --> 489.84000000000003
as a standard

487.36 --> 492.72
the corruption like no hitler did not

489.84 --> 496.4
incorporate corruption at all he was

492.72 --> 496.40000000000003
quite opposing to that actually

497.12 --> 500.8
that's how he clean up the place

503.84 --> 509.28
not of all of it perfect but

506.639 --> 509.28000000000003
resolute

511.28 --> 515.1999999999999
and corruption was that was the whole

513.36 --> 518.08
point it was all against corruption

515.2 --> 519.44
that's why it all started

518.08 --> 522.08
so

519.44 --> 523.7600000000001
right and a lot of people that are i

522.08 --> 525.76
don't know

523.76 --> 527.2
think that they are like neo-nazis or

525.76 --> 529.279
something they

527.2 --> 532.24
might hang on to that

529.279 --> 536.32
but not realizing like yo bro

532.24 --> 536.32
you've been tricked this is like a

536.48 --> 541.12
a spell that can last for centuries it's

539.279 --> 544.0
like

541.12 --> 545.839
they cursed

544.0 --> 548.24
that moment

545.839 --> 551.9200000000001
and if you don't see what they did then

548.24 --> 554.64
you think that it is all one thing no

551.92 --> 556.959
something really good happened then

554.64 --> 560.8389999999999
it got grabbled and then suddenly it

556.959 --> 565.1199999999999
turned corrupt and vile and just

560.839 --> 566.72
insane and super hypocritical

565.12 --> 568.48
it's two different things it was a

566.72 --> 571.2
poisoning

568.48 --> 571.2
of the spirit

571.279 --> 573.6
anyway

575.04 --> 578.76
uh hello pgcnet306

579.279 --> 585.72
joking okay

581.92 --> 585.7199999999999
that's not a good entry

594.24 --> 599.2
yeah okay mr jokerface

597.279 --> 603.279
popping up

599.2 --> 603.279
saying lol is not a good entry

603.839 --> 607.0400000000001
oh my god i already addressed that i

606.24 --> 608.5600000000001
wanted

607.04 --> 612.3199999999999
i literally addressed that on

608.56 --> 612.3199999999999
yesterday's show i don't even wanna

612.64 --> 616.68
i think he's freaking disgusting

621.04 --> 624.8
i would just

622.8 --> 626.3199999999999
i just kind of consider him like any

624.8 --> 629.279
other thug

626.32 --> 632.72
that seems to be enchanting people

629.279 --> 635.959
that are just like letting them do that

632.72 --> 635.9590000000001
it's disgusting

651.12 --> 657.6
oh yes joking oh thank you thank you so

655.68 --> 660.56
much

657.6 --> 663.839
oh my god i didn't know how how i could

660.56 --> 666.8
have held out in my life

663.839 --> 671.36
without that happening and then

666.8 --> 671.3599999999999
all those beautiful pictures

672.839 --> 677.2
yes beautiful oh

683.04 --> 685.92
debunk it

686.16 --> 692.56
are you serious joking

688.64 --> 692.56
you probably are it's really pathetic

694.48 --> 700.72
like there is no debunking it is so

697.839 --> 703.839
blatantly just an artist project i mean

700.72 --> 703.839
people have literally

704.32 --> 709.0400000000001
showed live

706.24 --> 712.8
how to effectively

709.04 --> 716.5999999999999
create an exact copy

712.8 --> 716.5999999999999
of some of these images

718.639 --> 721.519
this all you got

721.76 --> 725.6
you're starting to sound like shawn

723.36 --> 727.44
hawkins

725.6 --> 730.32
word salad

727.44 --> 734.8000000000001
what what the [ __ ]

730.32 --> 734.8000000000001
just spamming ridiculous things now

737.36 --> 741.639
it does sound like sean hawkins

755.92 --> 760.8
snowman

758.32 --> 762.399
[Music]

760.8 --> 765.3599999999999
don't exactly

762.399 --> 765.36
know what that means

770.399 --> 776.2
i'm sure it's some kind of a saying i'm

772.32 --> 776.2
not familiar with it

789.839 --> 794.8000000000001
ha a really pgc net that's hilarious

793.12 --> 797.9590000000001
yeah that makes no sense why would they

794.8 --> 797.959
do that

826.48 --> 832.639
okay so is that basically like german

828.72 --> 832.639
for the name is a sign

832.8 --> 838.4799999999999
because yeah he has the joker icon and i

835.6 --> 840.72
don't know what joking means though it's

838.48 --> 843.72
ridiculous

840.72 --> 843.72
but

865.36 --> 869.519
it's just some

866.72 --> 872.1600000000001
nasa picture boomer

869.519 --> 874.32
he's just trying to hold on i mean

872.16 --> 877.04
everything's taken from him his entire

874.32 --> 879.519
brain is gone i mean

877.04 --> 881.4399999999999
still holding on even though he's

879.519 --> 883.36
probably been facing

881.44 --> 886.0790000000001
all that information that he's just

883.36 --> 889.839
trying to deny exists

886.079 --> 889.8389999999999
because he went to the moon damn it

893.04 --> 897.079
don't take away the moon

903.44 --> 906.44
um

929.839 --> 935.44
wait

932.079 --> 935.4399999999999
i think it might be ed

936.56 --> 942.079
at face who i banned

940.24 --> 944.0
because of the rhythm and the energy

942.079 --> 946.2399999999999
level

944.0 --> 948.48
i mean if it was sean he would have now

946.24 --> 950.9590000000001
virtual signal that he was actually sean

948.48 --> 954.16
because he always does that

950.959 --> 957.04
can't help himself that's why i say that

954.16 --> 957.04
i think it's ed

960.639 --> 964.639
see

961.92 --> 966.24
there is an actual distinct advantage

964.639 --> 968.9590000000001
from sitting through the flat earth

966.24 --> 970.72
debate and hearing these numpties go

968.959 --> 973.7589999999999
wild at it

970.72 --> 977.12
because then i can like really get a

973.759 --> 978.9590000000001
very refined blueprint of their behavior

977.12 --> 981.44
and their energy output

978.959 --> 982.7199999999999
in order to identify them even if they

981.44 --> 984.24
go

982.72 --> 986.32
covert

984.24 --> 990.0790000000001
it's one of the reasons i really like

986.32 --> 990.0790000000001
sitting through the flat earth debates

990.32 --> 997.279
because it's a good spot to like fish up

993.199 --> 1000.3199999999999
a lot of great valuable metadata for

997.279 --> 1001.36
identification purposes

1000.32 --> 1003.1600000000001
yeah

1001.36 --> 1006.399
completely

1003.16 --> 1008.48
unregistered not electronic

1006.399 --> 1011.36
yeah

1008.48 --> 1012.639
it's actual spiritual metadata that i

1011.36 --> 1015.1990000000001
collect

1012.639 --> 1018.24
because i can

1015.199 --> 1019.68
it's how i reconstruct

1018.24 --> 1022.5600000000001
people

1019.68 --> 1025.6789999999999
in my mind very effectively and then i

1022.56 --> 1030.12
can even some point if i feel confident

1025.679 --> 1030.1200000000001
enough simulate it

1038.16 --> 1042.64
so yeah this guy it could be just

1040.48 --> 1043.919
another guy but

1042.64 --> 1046.959
i mean

1043.919 --> 1048.0
we did all see at face

1046.959 --> 1049.2
like

1048.0 --> 1053.36
trying to

1049.2 --> 1055.44
get in my chat a lot was it a week ago

1053.36 --> 1058.08
and it was kind of entertaining until he

1055.44 --> 1060.48
just went really annoying again and then

1058.08 --> 1062.559
i banned him

1060.48 --> 1064.72
because he does not have respect and if

1062.559 --> 1066.96
things heat up he will just keep pushing

1064.72 --> 1069.2
until the bubble pops he always does

1066.96 --> 1069.2
that

1078.08 --> 1084.48
my high priest

1079.76 --> 1085.76
no no actually no he's not you see

1084.48 --> 1087.52
a priest

1085.76 --> 1090.0
would never be able to

1087.52 --> 1093.0
just correct a high priest like that in

1090.0 --> 1093.0
public

1094.32 --> 1098.0
yet i do that

1095.919 --> 1100.24
also i share my

1098.0 --> 1103.12
grievances

1100.24 --> 1105.679
just out there open in the public

1103.12 --> 1109.4799999999998
that's not

1105.679 --> 1109.48
that doesn't uh

1110.799 --> 1115.039
give you the

1112.4 --> 1116.48
the the lead you need to to come to the

1115.039 --> 1119.84
conclusion

1116.48 --> 1121.76
of some kind of a high priest situation

1119.84 --> 1124.799
you see

1121.76 --> 1127.919
we are much more just like a

1124.799 --> 1127.9189999999999
a guild

1128.559 --> 1133.52
we are all there for our mutual benefit

1134.08 --> 1137.6
to learn together to write on each

1136.16 --> 1140.88
other's skills

1137.6 --> 1143.76
and master them and that includes

1140.88 --> 1145.1200000000001
like social skills as well

1143.76 --> 1147.6
analytical

1145.12 --> 1149.12
social even spiritual skills even though

1147.6 --> 1151.12
there's always going to be very

1149.12 --> 1153.039
oversensitive because of the different

1151.12 --> 1155.52
angles of approach and then all the heat

1153.039 --> 1158.08
that comes

1155.52 --> 1161.039
from like the

1158.08 --> 1164.32
more biblical christian side

1161.039 --> 1169.679
to the more well spiritual spiritist

1164.32 --> 1171.2
side to atheist approaches and etc etc

1169.679 --> 1173.76
it's all mixed in

1171.2 --> 1176.64
and there's yeah like

1173.76 --> 1178.96
i mean brian is very

1176.64 --> 1181.2
interesting he's like a bit of a

1178.96 --> 1183.8400000000001
wild speculator and i kind of respect

1181.2 --> 1186.64
that i used to be like that too

1183.84 --> 1189.76
when i was much younger

1186.64 --> 1192.16
now i don't focus on that

1189.76 --> 1192.96
frequency of

1192.16 --> 1196.0800000000002
yeah

1192.96 --> 1199.1200000000001
visionary deformation i'm more

1196.08 --> 1201.36
just the whole thing

1199.12 --> 1203.039
just everything is just a giant pattern

1201.36 --> 1204.4799999999998
that's what i do and that's not

1203.039 --> 1208.24
something you could typically

1204.48 --> 1210.32
communicate except for just laying out

1208.24 --> 1211.919
details in the moment

1210.32 --> 1214.32
esoterically

1211.919 --> 1214.3200000000002
anyway

1216.24 --> 1220.96
shawna hawkins was on ray mutt lutz

1218.96 --> 1222.0
stream this week

1220.96 --> 1223.6000000000001
really

1222.0 --> 1226.96
okay

1223.6 --> 1226.9599999999998
sean is funny okay

1227.52 --> 1229.76
i

1231.2 --> 1234.6000000000001
i don't know

1235.52 --> 1239.679
i mean maybe you find him entertaining

1237.679 --> 1240.96
like a kooky old man

1239.679 --> 1243.2800000000002
but this

1240.96 --> 1243.28
no

1244.96 --> 1249.8400000000001
i find it mostly annoying and tragic

1265.039 --> 1269.52
okay well joking

1266.88 --> 1271.919
you numpty [ __ ] exactly look at what

1269.52 --> 1273.84
you're saying

1271.919 --> 1276.7990000000002
and let me

1273.84 --> 1279.1999999999998
already uh explain how you literally

1276.799 --> 1281.76
contradict yourself in that sentence and

1279.2 --> 1283.1200000000001
you don't even realize it okay

1281.76 --> 1286.1589999999999
first you say

1283.12 --> 1288.1589999999999
i understand all the words you're saying

1286.159 --> 1290.7990000000002
okay so you get it

1288.159 --> 1293.919
i'm struggling to make sense of how you

1290.799 --> 1295.36
incoherently put them together

1293.919 --> 1298.159
okay

1295.36 --> 1299.36
so then you don't understand the words i

1298.159 --> 1301.7600000000002
was saying

1299.36 --> 1304.08
first you say you do and then oh wait

1301.76 --> 1305.84
but no it didn't make any sense so then

1304.08 --> 1308.8799999999999
you don't understand it

1305.84 --> 1311.4399999999998
that's brilliant dude

1308.88 --> 1313.44
is is that your virtue signaling of how

1311.44 --> 1315.6000000000001
much control you have over your

1313.44 --> 1317.76
weaponized dementia

1315.6 --> 1320.24
that you can literally understand it and

1317.76 --> 1322.4
then just might wipe yourself just to be

1320.24 --> 1324.559
able to at home the opponent is that

1322.4 --> 1328.3200000000002
what you're virtue signaling with

1324.559 --> 1328.32
you're double speaking funny [ __ ]

1330.4 --> 1333.4
joking

1333.679 --> 1337.8400000000001
word cell yeah yeah your

1336.24 --> 1339.2
that what you said right there is

1337.84 --> 1341.039
literally word cell it's

1339.2 --> 1343.3600000000001
self-contradicting

1341.039 --> 1345.76
and it's get it's kind of rutty

1343.36 --> 1349.039
it's getting kind of stinky

1345.76 --> 1349.039
it's not a fresh salad

1358.88 --> 1362.5590000000002
you're going to use that out here be

1360.64 --> 1365.76
careful voynich i mean weaponized

1362.559 --> 1365.76
dementia is like

1367.679 --> 1373.2
that's [ __ ] up i mean when people have

1370.08 --> 1376.48
weaponized dementia that is like really

1373.2 --> 1378.4
really far than they are like in hell

1376.48 --> 1380.24
right if you're gonna go get to the

1378.4 --> 1382.24
point where you have weaponized dementia

1380.24 --> 1384.48
you are in hell

1382.24 --> 1388.559
it's the only reason you could even be

1384.48 --> 1390.24
motivated to do that to yourself

1388.559 --> 1393.12
so

1390.24 --> 1395.84
anti-flat earthers i have seen them

1393.12 --> 1398.08
utilize weaponized dementia

1395.84 --> 1398.08
but

1398.32 --> 1402.799
yeah most people

1400.0 --> 1405.6
even the anti-flat earthers still have

1402.799 --> 1407.679
well a sense of dignity in order to just

1405.6 --> 1409.6
not do that

1407.679 --> 1411.52
they might get caught up in the moment

1409.6 --> 1413.76
in the heat of the moment then end up

1411.52 --> 1415.76
double speaking like rumpus right but

1413.76 --> 1417.44
when rumpus is calm

1415.76 --> 1420.08
you would never do that to himself

1417.44 --> 1422.64
because weaponized dementia

1420.08 --> 1427.36
is usually

1422.64 --> 1427.3600000000001
like drawing upon a heated situation

1427.44 --> 1432.559
to have that weird dementia effect

1430.24 --> 1435.2
basically artificially

1432.559 --> 1438.08
blowing yourself up in order to get that

1435.2 --> 1441.6000000000001
effect prematurely

1438.08 --> 1444.559
that's kind of weaponized dementia

1441.6 --> 1447.279
right but that's really gross it's it's

1444.559 --> 1450.72
like what sjws do it's marxist it's a

1447.279 --> 1450.72
mark this marxist tactic

1450.799 --> 1455.279
it's basically just ah

1453.2 --> 1457.2
turning on the demon

1455.279 --> 1460.24
the demon of dementia

1457.2 --> 1460.24
which is a demon

1471.52 --> 1474.6399999999999
oh yes

1483.84 --> 1488.799
yeah joking yeah i let i let him do that

1487.36 --> 1491.1999999999998
you see

1488.799 --> 1493.44
that i'll just let 10th man

1491.2 --> 1494.96
do what he's been doing with his

1493.44 --> 1497.52
attitude

1494.96 --> 1500.559
and i'm withdrawing

1497.52 --> 1502.48
from my original attitude in which i was

1500.559 --> 1504.1589999999999
communicating that i did not like being

1502.48 --> 1505.84
talked to like that and being treated

1504.159 --> 1508.4
like that

1505.84 --> 1510.1589999999999
but you see i am in a relatively high

1508.4 --> 1512.48
energy position even though i seem a

1510.159 --> 1515.44
little fatigued sometimes

1512.48 --> 1517.6
when i do have my attention about me

1515.44 --> 1519.2
it's extremely

1517.6 --> 1521.6789999999999
high focused

1519.2 --> 1525.039
like surreal levels it's

1521.679 --> 1527.279
it's intentionally focused sometimes

1525.039 --> 1530.0
with these things and that's how i get a

1527.279 --> 1531.52
lot of esoteric data metadata through

1530.0 --> 1534.64
people

1531.52 --> 1535.679
so i'll just let 10th man do that

1534.64 --> 1538.3200000000002
because

1535.679 --> 1540.5590000000002
it's been exposed i've i'm not holding

1538.32 --> 1542.6399999999999
my tongue i've shared it

1540.559 --> 1544.48
how i feel about how tenth man deals

1542.64 --> 1546.5590000000002
with me sometimes when he's in that type

1544.48 --> 1548.48
of mood

1546.559 --> 1551.44
and

1548.48 --> 1554.159
it will reflect back on to him that's

1551.44 --> 1556.64
exactly how it works he's doing it i'm

1554.159 --> 1558.88
not doing that

1556.64 --> 1560.64
and i am well aware of it and i don't

1558.88 --> 1564.159
like it

1560.64 --> 1566.72
and if he goes too far i'll push back

1564.159 --> 1568.3200000000002
but i have actually laid out exactly

1566.72 --> 1569.6000000000001
what's going on and i have shared my

1568.32 --> 1571.6789999999999
grievances

1569.6 --> 1574.32
not holding my tongue on that and i'll

1571.679 --> 1576.799
just let him do the rest

1574.32 --> 1579.9189999999999
because he just needs to get over that i

1576.799 --> 1581.279
realize he can't dominate me he just

1579.919 --> 1583.6000000000001
can't

1581.279 --> 1585.44
he just can't do that i'm not allowing

1583.6 --> 1587.6
it

1585.44 --> 1587.6000000000001
so

1590.32 --> 1595.6789999999999
yeah i know joking i know but that's but

1593.52 --> 1599.6
that's a rowdiness problem that's not

1595.679 --> 1601.679
exclusive to 10th man okay i mean try

1599.6 --> 1603.12
and interrupt brian you could live it

1601.679 --> 1605.1200000000001
now

1603.12 --> 1607.84
he's lost all his patience for

1605.12 --> 1611.6
interruption and that's like includes

1607.84 --> 1613.6
even when we're not being recorded

1611.6 --> 1615.279
he's just

1613.6 --> 1616.3999999999999
he can't deal with it

1615.279 --> 1618.96
so

1616.4 --> 1621.3600000000001
and i too sometimes now have to just

1618.96 --> 1623.3600000000001
make a stand like hey can you not rumpus

1621.36 --> 1625.76
me i'm not done with the explanation yet

1623.36 --> 1626.8799999999999
because it seems like oh well if arwen

1625.76 --> 1629.52
is talking

1626.88 --> 1632.24
then of course it's like oh

1629.52 --> 1634.799
well he's had like a two-hour show every

1632.24 --> 1636.799
day so of course if he speaks up i can

1634.799 --> 1639.039
just start blabbering on

1636.799 --> 1642.32
about something else halfway sentence

1639.039 --> 1643.84
and then afterward even complain

1642.32 --> 1646.24
about

1643.84 --> 1648.24
me complaining about being interrupted

1646.24 --> 1650.64
yeah

1648.24 --> 1652.96
so i'm just

1650.64 --> 1654.96
just letting it be what it is you know

1652.96 --> 1657.52
and i'll leave my

1654.96 --> 1660.48
detailed analysis and complaints to my

1657.52 --> 1662.24
own show so i thank you

1660.48 --> 1664.48
for bringing up

1662.24 --> 1668.08
those little confrontations in your

1664.48 --> 1669.3600000000001
attempt to sabotage the cohesion of our

1668.08 --> 1672.1589999999999
group

1669.36 --> 1675.9189999999999
because now by being reminded about that

1672.159 --> 1679.7600000000002
in your attempt to sabotage our group

1675.919 --> 1681.6000000000001
i've actually been invigorated

1679.76 --> 1684.0
to yeah

1681.6 --> 1685.12
give it a little analysis which is

1684.0 --> 1687.6
valuable

1685.12 --> 1689.4399999999998
valuable for everybody

1687.6 --> 1691.36
thank you troll

1689.44 --> 1693.44
thank you for handing me that

1691.36 --> 1697.6
inspiration and energy

1693.44 --> 1700.24
to strengthen us strengthen our cohesion

1697.6 --> 1700.24
i thank you

1708.64 --> 1712.6000000000001
hey does studio is 68.

1733.679 --> 1738.88
right talking about which

1736.0 --> 1741.6
it seems like that issue between jim bob

1738.88 --> 1744.24
and jaren is not a one-time thing

1741.6 --> 1744.24
apparently

1748.399 --> 1751.399
okay

1752.799 --> 1755.039
uh

1756.72 --> 1760.64
earlier today

1758.24 --> 1763.1200000000001
jaron apparently still had a very late

1760.64 --> 1766.5590000000002
night stream

1763.12 --> 1769.36
and he just seemed so angry

1766.559 --> 1773.12
and i mean and not arwenian angry

1769.36 --> 1773.12
because i don't think he has that in him

1773.679 --> 1776.96
it's not pretty when that comes out with

1775.919 --> 1779.96
him

1776.96 --> 1781.919
we can't our kid can

1779.96 --> 1783.279
aestheticize it

1781.919 --> 1785.5200000000002
like i can

1783.279 --> 1785.52
but

1785.679 --> 1790.3200000000002
like this is

1788.399 --> 1792.7199999999998
not a good thing

1790.32 --> 1792.72
i mean

1792.799 --> 1797.279
i'm not saying like oh he's always

1795.12 --> 1800.32
everything jiren says is wrong and and

1797.279 --> 1803.2
jim bob is completely right no no it

1800.32 --> 1806.32
seems both parties are

1803.2 --> 1809.3600000000001
there's a dichotomy forming between them

1806.32 --> 1813.2
this is not good on the long run i mean

1809.36 --> 1816.08
this could like turn really hostile

1813.2 --> 1819.3600000000001
unless they [ __ ] get over themselves

1816.08 --> 1819.36
and i mean both of you

1819.6 --> 1827.12
also jim bob because he seems to be like

1823.919 --> 1829.5200000000002
super confident and he's even like

1827.12 --> 1830.7199999999998
esoterically techno babbling a little

1829.52 --> 1832.1589999999999
here and there

1830.72 --> 1834.48
yeah

1832.159 --> 1836.48
he is i mean if you test him on it he'd

1834.48 --> 1838.64
figure a way through but he is doing

1836.48 --> 1841.279
that and that's kind of inappropriate in

1838.64 --> 1845.8400000000001
this situation i think

1841.279 --> 1847.919
because jeremy is a very well developed

1845.84 --> 1849.9189999999999
personal philosopher he does

1847.919 --> 1852.3990000000001
pay a lot of attention and energy to

1849.919 --> 1854.159
what he thinks about i don't agree with

1852.399 --> 1855.84
everything i think it's a little

1854.159 --> 1858.3200000000002
bleeding heart here and there what he

1855.84 --> 1860.799
actually focuses on and i think that is

1858.32 --> 1863.039
kind of not the way to go but he does

1860.799 --> 1863.039
that

1863.2 --> 1867.2
right i'm much more of

1865.6 --> 1870.7199999999998
yeah

1867.2 --> 1870.72
different frequency like that

1871.36 --> 1873.6789999999999
and

1875.44 --> 1881.1200000000001
it just brings out like a weird

1878.559 --> 1884.799
vindictive type of nature with jaren

1881.12 --> 1884.799
that i think is not a good one

1886.96 --> 1890.24
right but

1888.08 --> 1892.72
if he just say like yeah

1890.24 --> 1896.32
i mean

1892.72 --> 1898.64
what jim bob is doing with his

1896.32 --> 1899.6
uh orthodox christian

1898.64 --> 1901.76
group

1899.6 --> 1904.6399999999999
which is this kind of turning into

1901.76 --> 1907.2
it's very interesting but it is just

1904.64 --> 1909.6000000000001
basically guys having a conversation in

1907.2 --> 1912.559
church like that that really is what it

1909.6 --> 1914.6399999999999
is it is absolutely not perfect and i've

1912.559 --> 1916.72
been listening a lot and they make a lot

1914.64 --> 1919.44
of really

1916.72 --> 1922.88
stupid leaps sometimes

1919.44 --> 1925.279
and overall it's like sensible but

1922.88 --> 1928.159
they are like kind of still building

1925.279 --> 1929.84
they don't have like a really strong

1928.159 --> 1932.7990000000002
universal

1929.84 --> 1936.24
fractal oversight they don't

1932.799 --> 1939.039
they have a good cohesive cohesion

1936.24 --> 1939.039
energy wise

1939.279 --> 1943.12
but it's not always perfect

1944.08 --> 1947.6789999999999
right and so there's the an issue

1946.32 --> 1949.6
between these two if they're going to

1947.679 --> 1951.6000000000001
keep going at it

1949.6 --> 1954.799
this is just going to get really trashy

1951.6 --> 1954.799
and it's going to set

1954.96 --> 1958.0
yeah

1956.32 --> 1959.9189999999999
angry blood i don't know if that's a

1958.0 --> 1960.84
saying in english it isn't dutch it's

1959.919 --> 1964.0
just

1960.84 --> 1966.8799999999999
unnecessary unnecessarily hostile

1964.0 --> 1969.12
attitudes don't do that don't mock each

1966.88 --> 1969.1200000000001
other

1969.36 --> 1973.1999999999998
like that

1971.12 --> 1974.7199999999998
and don't

1973.2 --> 1977.6000000000001
like yeah

1974.72 --> 1980.32
to jim bob especially like don't call

1977.6 --> 1982.0
jaron an atheist i mean he's not an

1980.32 --> 1983.9189999999999
atheist

1982.0 --> 1985.76
he's just

1983.919 --> 1988.88
specifically

1985.76 --> 1991.2
non-biblical and he lays out exactly why

1988.88 --> 1994.0800000000002
and he's done an elaborate review and i

1991.2 --> 1996.0800000000002
kind of agreed to a lot of those things

1994.08 --> 2000.559
here's the thing though

1996.08 --> 2000.559
that's your contemporary view

2000.88 --> 2005.44
you have to still attempt a

2003.159 --> 2008.0
contextualize it much deeper in the

2005.44 --> 2011.1200000000001
scenario that it was in even to just

2008.0 --> 2013.6
discover the spirit of the people that

2011.12 --> 2015.36
put it down on paper which is also a

2013.6 --> 2016.32
factor

2015.36 --> 2018.7199999999998
right

2016.32 --> 2021.36
so

2018.72 --> 2023.679
if jeremy would say like oh the book is

2021.36 --> 2025.6
yeah it's written by madman and

2023.679 --> 2027.279
like this is not my god

2025.6 --> 2031.12
my god does not do these things it's

2027.279 --> 2034.48
like yeah that's [ __ ] pointless

2031.12 --> 2034.4799999999998
but just

2034.559 --> 2039.279
you're not getting the book for what it

2036.64 --> 2040.7990000000002
is it shouldn't be a direct life

2039.279 --> 2043.76
instruction manual that you should

2040.799 --> 2045.84
follow to letter

2043.76 --> 2047.44
how the hell would you even do that that

2045.84 --> 2049.359
makes no sense

2047.44 --> 2052.079
but

2049.359 --> 2053.7599999999998
if you see it as a really

2052.079 --> 2054.76
fascinating

2053.76 --> 2057.9190000000003
heavy

2054.76 --> 2059.44
esoterically loaded and politicized

2057.919 --> 2061.44
document

2059.44 --> 2063.2000000000003
that is quite unique

2061.44 --> 2066.639
then you might realize that there's just

2063.2 --> 2067.919
so much more to find in this book

2066.639 --> 2070.56
besides

2067.919 --> 2072.879
some idea of a personal instruction

2070.56 --> 2076.96
manual

2072.879 --> 2076.96
mostly talking about old testament stuff

2083.04 --> 2089.48
right

2084.56 --> 2089.48
so i noticed that that that's going

2090.24 --> 2096.2
yeah you can get the [ __ ] out of here

2092.0 --> 2096.2
now i'm done with you bye

2113.359 --> 2116.359
goody

2123.52 --> 2126.8
uh some

2125.119 --> 2131.839
wedding or something but i think they're

2126.8 --> 2131.8390000000004
stuck in traffic like what the [ __ ]

2134.32 --> 2137.28
some kind of joke

2137.92 --> 2143.56
yeah hey friday get the [ __ ] out

2147.04 --> 2150.04
chief

2168.88 --> 2176.0
right so yeah that was a

2173.04 --> 2176.0
that's absolutely it

2176.079 --> 2180.6400000000003
that was what i was watching also some

2178.079 --> 2182.32
owen benjamin

2180.64 --> 2185.5989999999997
kind of gut wrenching

2182.32 --> 2187.92
with his dog and all that

2185.599 --> 2190.96
i mean that really does kind of get to

2187.92 --> 2193.28
me so i'm sometimes like bracing because

2190.96 --> 2195.68
this just

2193.28 --> 2199.2400000000002
reminds me of

2195.68 --> 2199.24
my old cat

2204.88 --> 2211.599
but yeah he had some really bizarre and

2207.76 --> 2215.8390000000004
interesting insights about donald trump

2211.599 --> 2215.839
it's kind of surreal but

2220.56 --> 2227.599
i mean we'll see

2223.44 --> 2229.52
i mean he might just sort of be right

2227.599 --> 2232.0
there was always a lot of really weird

2229.52 --> 2234.48
[ __ ] with donald trump

2232.0 --> 2234.48
always

2237.28 --> 2242.52
anyway so is anybody still alive in this

2239.52 --> 2242.52
chat

2247.52 --> 2252.4
or you don't know what to do anymore in

2249.68 --> 2255.1189999999997
my chat now that i deleted joking what's

2252.4 --> 2255.119
going on here

2255.52 --> 2258.96
it's been seven minutes

2263.2 --> 2266.48
i'm gonna refresh here

2269.44 --> 2273.119
gaming while listening okay

2278.72 --> 2283.64
you were mentioning feb what

2287.28 --> 2294.28
let earth

2289.52 --> 2294.28
what is what do you mean tear it

2301.92 --> 2305.76
oh you're right martin litka

2307.599 --> 2313.839
yeah i was mentioning him yeah

2309.92 --> 2313.839
i've mentioned him quite a few times

2315.359 --> 2318.56
maybe you accused him of something

2317.599 --> 2320.4
yeah

2318.56 --> 2322.56
i mean

2320.4 --> 2325.28
i'm accuse him of being a complete

2322.56 --> 2328.24
bullshitter

2325.28 --> 2330.2400000000002
like but that should be freaking obvious

2328.24 --> 2332.56
in plain sight by now because he's

2330.24 --> 2335.2799999999997
always done things like that

2332.56 --> 2338.24
he's always bullshitting

2335.28 --> 2341.92
and he's talking it's just he's that guy

2338.24 --> 2343.7599999999998
in the cafe that just always tells you

2341.92 --> 2346.32
whatever nonsense story and you just

2343.76 --> 2348.32
have a few beers and then haha

2346.32 --> 2351.44
that's martin and it's how he's always

2348.32 --> 2353.119
been and like he constantly shows images

2351.44 --> 2354.88
and then says things about it and it's

2353.119 --> 2358.56
complete horseshit

2354.88 --> 2363.52
and i mean horse [ __ ]

2358.56 --> 2367.119
like no martin no that's not what this

2363.52 --> 2370.72
like all the time all the time as in

2367.119 --> 2373.119
75 of everything he does on his videos

2370.72 --> 2376.7999999999997
like no martin that's not what this is

2373.119 --> 2376.8
you're an idiot but it's okay

2377.52 --> 2382.28
people really like it

2386.0 --> 2389.04
right

2386.88 --> 2391.6800000000003
and i still like martin

2389.04 --> 2394.079
yes he's an idiot but i do like him

2391.68 --> 2396.16
and i don't want to like

2394.079 --> 2398.0
present myself like oh i'm so much

2396.16 --> 2400.64
better than him

2398.0 --> 2403.44
i'm just taking note like dude

2400.64 --> 2405.1189999999997
that is not a good foundational source

2403.44 --> 2406.56
for your

2405.119 --> 2409.56
elaborate

2406.56 --> 2409.56
research

2411.359 --> 2414.0789999999997
he yeah

2416.48 --> 2420.48
he has quite the image yeah i bet he

2418.4 --> 2422.319
does because he has absolutely no

2420.48 --> 2424.8
grounding whatsoever

2422.319 --> 2426.4
i mean yeah if you can just say whatever

2424.8 --> 2428.88
you like because you don't know what the

2426.4 --> 2432.7200000000003
[ __ ] is real anymore yeah then you'll

2428.88 --> 2437.319
have quite an imagination won't you

2432.72 --> 2437.319
because everything is imagination then

2442.64 --> 2446.8799999999997
i have quite the imagination myself

2447.2 --> 2451.48
not as good as lesbian hitler

2453.28 --> 2457.76
it probably doesn't like that idea

2456.16 --> 2459.839
or maybe he does maybe he thinks it's

2457.76 --> 2464.0400000000004
funny or maybe it's just like no i'm not

2459.839 --> 2464.04
going there i don't know man

2468.319 --> 2471.52
too much suggestion

2474.079 --> 2479.92
right but lesbian hitler

2476.64 --> 2482.64
i think that is that is not something i

2479.92 --> 2484.88
just made up out of nothing to entertain

2482.64 --> 2487.04
myself

2484.88 --> 2488.0
which is a lot of time what martin does

2487.04 --> 2490.319
he's just

2488.0 --> 2491.599
throwing out whatever comes to mind

2490.319 --> 2494.16
in the moment

2491.599 --> 2496.56
and is not very cohesive with it on the

2494.16 --> 2496.56
long run

2503.52 --> 2509.44
right but yeah lesbian hitler that has

2506.96 --> 2511.119
had some background research including

2509.44 --> 2512.64
that grab like

2511.119 --> 2515.839
back

2512.64 --> 2519.04
over 20 years

2515.839 --> 2521.68
in some of the weirder parts of my life

2519.04 --> 2523.119
where i experienced all kinds of very

2521.68 --> 2526.319
mystical

2523.119 --> 2528.319
things to me at that time

2526.319 --> 2530.16
but it's like things being confronted

2528.319 --> 2532.4
with it

2530.16 --> 2535.68
and whatever it is i always take it

2532.4 --> 2536.4
serious even if it seems completely

2535.68 --> 2539.44
like

2536.4 --> 2542.96
no no no no no right then it's like oh

2539.44 --> 2544.88
that means i have to exactly

2542.96 --> 2546.64
absorb this because there's probably

2544.88 --> 2548.6400000000003
something about it doesn't mean i have

2546.64 --> 2552.0789999999997
to agree to it or even remember it in

2548.64 --> 2553.44
that moment but i have to absorb it for

2552.079 --> 2555.52
later

2553.44 --> 2559.2000000000003
and that way i absorbed a whole bunch of

2555.52 --> 2561.28
weird information including people that

2559.2 --> 2562.839
well basically held a

2561.28 --> 2567.2000000000003
photograph is

2562.839 --> 2569.7599999999998
it i think so like photographs of hitler

2567.2 --> 2573.359
and then like the later photos

2569.76 --> 2576.8
and literally i on my own volition said

2573.359 --> 2576.7999999999997
that's not the same person

2576.88 --> 2581.28
just immediately not nobody even asking

2579.599 --> 2582.96
a question it's just like oh look at

2581.28 --> 2585.599
this look at that look at that and

2582.96 --> 2588.2400000000002
that's not hitler

2585.599 --> 2590.1600000000003
just immediately that was my response

2588.24 --> 2593.2799999999997
never having seen that before never even

2590.16 --> 2596.72
having heard anything about hitler never

2593.28 --> 2597.8390000000004
reading anything about him ever

2596.72 --> 2601.2
just like

2597.839 --> 2601.2
that's not the same person

2602.8 --> 2605.28
and this

2605.359 --> 2609.359
kind of connected in with that and yeah

2607.44 --> 2611.359
benjamin brought it up

2609.359 --> 2614.56
in a funny way

2611.359 --> 2616.96
that just reminded me like [ __ ]

2614.56 --> 2619.359
i remember something about that

2616.96 --> 2621.68
there's something weird that happened

2619.359 --> 2623.92
well i just laid it out yesterday on my

2621.68 --> 2623.9199999999996
show

2626.96 --> 2632.48
right there's a cohesion behind it

2629.92 --> 2632.48
there's a

2633.2 --> 2639.1189999999997
like if it's true there's historical

2636.16 --> 2642.0
significance and like meaning

2639.119 --> 2643.6800000000003
significance to it

2642.0 --> 2646.16
was a good show yesterday thank you

2643.68 --> 2650.5989999999997
thank you voynich

2646.16 --> 2650.5989999999997
hello dmk 2020

2670.72 --> 2673.5989999999997
not foolish

2675.599 --> 2680.7200000000003
well look furniture

2678.48 --> 2682.079
what is foolish you know

2680.72 --> 2684.64
is that

2682.079 --> 2688.319
the opposite of smart and insightful or

2684.64 --> 2690.8799999999997
is that the opposite of wise

2688.319 --> 2692.24
and sharply intuitive

2690.88 --> 2694.7200000000003
right

2692.24 --> 2698.4799999999996
i mean i think martin has a pretty

2694.72 --> 2698.48
decently sharp intuition

2702.319 --> 2705.839
despite everything

2706.0 --> 2711.119
like he knows how to recognize

2708.4 --> 2714.079
certain energies and just in that moment

2711.119 --> 2716.6400000000003
know what the what it is and

2714.079 --> 2716.6400000000003
what to do

2717.119 --> 2721.76
but when it comes to like actually

2719.92 --> 2725.04
insightful

2721.76 --> 2727.8390000000004
like logically insightful mechanically

2725.04 --> 2732.4
oversight connecting everything up

2727.839 --> 2734.64
yeah he is not a star at that at all

2732.4 --> 2737.6800000000003
he really isn't and he's almost like

2734.64 --> 2739.92
using that inability of his to just keep

2737.68 --> 2741.839
on going and going and just throwing out

2739.92 --> 2743.76
whatever because he just can't find any

2741.839 --> 2747.2
cohesion ever

2743.76 --> 2749.3590000000004
so he's he's not bothered by seeing the

2747.2 --> 2751.9199999999996
cohesion and then feeling forced to

2749.359 --> 2754.16
adapt to that pattern

2751.92 --> 2756.96
because he just just doesn't see it

2754.16 --> 2760.7999999999997
i constantly see cohesion in everything

2756.96 --> 2763.68
and i have to adapt always like every

2760.8 --> 2763.6800000000003
waking second

2764.96 --> 2772.04
like and even every sleeping second it

2767.76 --> 2772.0400000000004
doesn't stop even when i dream

2777.2 --> 2783.1189999999997
are we impersonators no

2780.319 --> 2783.119
there are none

2786.4 --> 2790.56
dude

2787.28 --> 2793.28
you cannot verbally sound like me you

2790.56 --> 2793.2799999999997
can't do that

2800.079 --> 2806.1600000000003
i've never heard anybody even try

2803.359 --> 2808.88
to actually mimic me

2806.16 --> 2811.44
people describe me that's already kind

2808.88 --> 2816.92
of troublesome sometimes right

2811.44 --> 2816.92
try to mimic me yeah good luck with that

2846.96 --> 2851.4
yeah that's right point each yeah he

2848.4 --> 2851.4
does

2871.68 --> 2877.359
all right oh just stupid socks yeah of

2874.72 --> 2879.68
course dude there's thousands of them i

2877.359 --> 2881.7599999999998
probably have the biggest collection of

2879.68 --> 2883.359
impersonating sock trolls using my

2881.76 --> 2885.599
pictures

2883.359 --> 2887.44
in the entirety of youtube

2885.599 --> 2889.6800000000003
nah probably not

2887.44 --> 2891.92
but i'm still pretty high up on that

2889.68 --> 2891.9199999999996
list

2895.119 --> 2900.119
i've seen hundreds of different pictures

2929.359 --> 2933.5589999999997
we don't care socktroll

2949.119 --> 2954.079
oh wait

2951.44 --> 2955.599
2020 it wasn't actually i thought he was

2954.079 --> 2957.04
made yeah that makes no sense he

2955.599 --> 2960.6400000000003
couldn't have made his

2957.04 --> 2962.72
sock account two days ahead

2960.64 --> 2964.48
sorry about that

2962.72 --> 2965.52
we'll see if you're an actual real

2964.48 --> 2969.96
person

2965.52 --> 2969.96
or just a really old sock

2984.96 --> 2993.2400000000002
the sprouts of doom however is a saw

2988.8 --> 2993.2400000000002
count from today bye bye

3018.319 --> 3021.52
right but yeah look

3024.0 --> 3030.24
for what i actually do i don't have a

3026.8 --> 3032.319
lot of interest in martin's work

3030.24 --> 3036.16
it's just nothing i can really do about

3032.319 --> 3037.7599999999998
it i can just try to sort of warn people

3036.16 --> 3039.52
and i try to do that with a lot of

3037.76 --> 3041.92
videos out there because there's a lot

3039.52 --> 3043.44
of streamers and not streamers the video

3041.92 --> 3045.92
uploaders

3043.44 --> 3048.48
and they're like oh so conspiracy also

3045.92 --> 3050.96
this and then and also flashy and also

3048.48 --> 3053.44
extreme and you just get pulled on like

3050.96 --> 3055.359
this roller coaster ride and at the end

3053.44 --> 3057.28
of it you have no [ __ ] idea what's

3055.359 --> 3059.5989999999997
going on

3057.28 --> 3061.92
or you believe in things that are like

3059.599 --> 3065.92
really impressive to you but you haven't

3061.92 --> 3065.92
actually seen any real proof for it

3066.0 --> 3070.96
it's all kinds of suggestions without

3068.24 --> 3072.5589999999997
proof and it just seems to fit but it

3070.96 --> 3074.4
doesn't really

3072.559 --> 3076.6400000000003
and then you yeah you get caught

3074.4 --> 3080.599
believing that in defending that in my

3076.64 --> 3080.5989999999997
chat for example

3083.28 --> 3085.6800000000003
you know

3085.76 --> 3091.8390000000004
i avoid those types of videos like the

3088.4 --> 3095.119
plague it literally it physically hurts

3091.839 --> 3098.72
me to watch those kinds of videos it

3095.119 --> 3098.7200000000003
physically hurts me

3099.28 --> 3102.4
yeah

3100.319 --> 3105.2
that's why i

3102.4 --> 3107.6800000000003
think that people that complain about my

3105.2 --> 3111.839
content and try to troll me over to get

3107.68 --> 3112.7999999999997
me shut down are unbelievable idiots

3111.839 --> 3115.04
because

3112.8 --> 3117.3590000000004
if there's a video out there that hurts

3115.04 --> 3121.359
me you know what i do

3117.359 --> 3121.359
i don't watch them anymore

3121.52 --> 3126.8
oh you don't know how to do that

3124.559 --> 3126.8
what

3127.68 --> 3132.0
you don't know how to stop hurting

3129.52 --> 3132.0
yourself

3132.24 --> 3136.24
really

3133.68 --> 3138.64
stop stop hitting yourself stop hitting

3136.24 --> 3140.64
yourself just stop it stop hitting

3138.64 --> 3143.04
yourself oh no and and then you're gonna

3140.64 --> 3145.5989999999997
complain to me

3143.04 --> 3147.44
about you not being able to stop hitting

3145.599 --> 3151.52
yourself

3147.44 --> 3153.839
because of the way that i do my shows

3151.52 --> 3153.839
okay

3155.52 --> 3160.079
you could also just

3157.44 --> 3162.559
not watch and do something else you

3160.079 --> 3164.8390000000004
might actually be able to get something

3162.559 --> 3167.6800000000003
productive out of your time

3164.839 --> 3169.2
then yeah because whining and

3167.68 --> 3171.52
complaining

3169.2 --> 3174.52
is not a productive way to spend your

3171.52 --> 3174.52
time

3181.04 --> 3187.04
all right pikachu yeah

3183.04 --> 3187.04
i don't really watch it anymore either

3187.28 --> 3190.7200000000003
i mean sometimes

3189.119 --> 3192.96
it's like sometimes

3190.72 --> 3196.0
this is the funny thing sometimes i feel

3192.96 --> 3198.319
like crushed or something i'm like

3196.0 --> 3199.839
hurt and i just need to get my mind out

3198.319 --> 3200.8
of it and i'm like

3199.839 --> 3203.44
dude

3200.8 --> 3206.48
let's just go over to that silly flat

3203.44 --> 3207.68
over cafe saturday night martin luther

3206.48 --> 3210.72
stream

3207.68 --> 3212.64
because it's just like okay i get a beer

3210.72 --> 3214.7999999999997
a joint and just like

3212.64 --> 3217.44
oh let oh let's see what kind of

3214.8 --> 3218.319
[ __ ] he's gonna figure out around

3217.44 --> 3220.319
now

3218.319 --> 3221.599
i'm just gonna laugh every step of the

3220.319 --> 3223.599
way like

3221.599 --> 3226.48
martin actually thinks i'm gonna buy

3223.599 --> 3228.7200000000003
that that is so funny martin

3226.48 --> 3231.52
i'm not gonna troll him about it how

3228.72 --> 3233.2799999999997
dare you no i'm just looking at it and

3231.52 --> 3235.359
like that is

3233.28 --> 3237.119
really funny

3235.359 --> 3239.44
that you think that

3237.119 --> 3243.04
i would believe that

3239.44 --> 3246.64
or did you even care are you just saying

3243.04 --> 3248.88
something you don't even have a plan

3246.64 --> 3251.04
sometimes

3248.88 --> 3253.44
and i can enjoy it

3251.04 --> 3255.92
and sometimes even the silly little

3253.44 --> 3258.16
gross images are kind of funny until

3255.92 --> 3261.2000000000003
like it gets really christ blasphemous

3258.16 --> 3262.8799999999997
and then it just starts to piss me off

3261.2 --> 3265.52
i don't like those

3262.88 --> 3268.2400000000002
but like silly naughty like

3265.52 --> 3270.88
sort of monty python type little

3268.24 --> 3272.3999999999996
thingies yeah i think even that can be

3270.88 --> 3275.6800000000003
funny it's

3272.4 --> 3275.6800000000003
gross sometimes but

3276.16 --> 3281.1189999999997
but yeah what do you expect it's like a

3278.319 --> 3284.16
cafe a saturday night cafe and you're

3281.119 --> 3287.04
just all there and just flat earth [ __ ]

3284.16 --> 3289.44
and tartaria stuff and

3287.04 --> 3292.0
oh look at this fractal thing of that

3289.44 --> 3294.7200000000003
and the little spirits and just that's

3292.0 --> 3294.72
what that is

3296.319 --> 3300.64
so sometimes yeah it can be in the mood

3298.319 --> 3304.96
for a little martin litke but it's not

3300.64 --> 3308.0789999999997
definitely not the highlight of my week

3304.96 --> 3310.64
it's not like oh my god i can't wait oh

3308.079 --> 3313.599
and wait for that no

3310.64 --> 3316.799
but it yeah it's it's like a cafe i mean

3313.599 --> 3318.7200000000003
i don't really go to cafes

3316.799 --> 3321.68
but if i knew there was this awesome

3318.72 --> 3324.0
cafe with like flat earthers like that

3321.68 --> 3326.24
and it's always full

3324.0 --> 3329.44
and it's like flat earthers and like

3326.24 --> 3333.64
annoying ball nerds just get kicked out

3329.44 --> 3333.64
dude i'd love it there

3335.119 --> 3338.559
and yeah

3336.559 --> 3341.0400000000004
online that is kind of what

3338.559 --> 3343.8390000000004
martin luther's streams are

3341.04 --> 3343.839
to me anyway

3346.16 --> 3350.5589999999997
all right and i know i can say all these

3348.48 --> 3353.839
things because i know that martin

3350.559 --> 3356.3190000000004
understands why i do what i do

3353.839 --> 3357.359
that i am kind of compulsive to in my

3356.319 --> 3359.599
own way

3357.359 --> 3362.0
and that i mean no harm

3359.599 --> 3364.48
he understands that

3362.0 --> 3367.359
like he can actually take criticism it

3364.48 --> 3370.72
doesn't happen a lot but he can actually

3367.359 --> 3372.799
take it as a man

3370.72 --> 3374.48
unless he's like really upset about

3372.799 --> 3376.48
something and then he can get a bit

3374.48 --> 3378.0
squirted yeah but who who doesn't you

3376.48 --> 3380.4
know when they're really upset about

3378.0 --> 3380.4
something

3381.52 --> 3384.88
in my own way i do too

3385.119 --> 3387.44
right

3389.68 --> 3395.2
but yeah that's martin litke and there's

3391.92 --> 3395.2000000000003
other people out there

3395.76 --> 3402.3190000000004
that i find extremely informative that

3398.4 --> 3404.319
seem to kind of dig into the same things

3402.319 --> 3407.119
and i follow those channels and i even

3404.319 --> 3409.119
report out on the videos

3407.119 --> 3412.079
like for example

3409.119 --> 3412.079
it's the name again

3412.36 --> 3415.449
[Music]

3416.0 --> 3419.4
where's it

3420.079 --> 3424.6400000000003
mind mind unveiled yeah

3426.64 --> 3433.04
i've seen many many great

3430.24 --> 3434.8799999999997
presentations on that channel

3433.04 --> 3436.72
that are really great

3434.88 --> 3438.799
and it is kind of the same direction the

3436.72 --> 3442.0
same sort of thing it's just much more

3438.799 --> 3444.839
subtle and more careful

3442.0 --> 3447.839
more carefully thought through much more

3444.839 --> 3450.0
cohesive so that's typically what i like

3447.839 --> 3451.7599999999998
to watch instead

3450.0 --> 3453.44
i don't really need a place to hang

3451.76 --> 3455.599
around and just like

3453.44 --> 3458.599
a flat earth cafe i don't really need

3455.599 --> 3458.599
that

3468.319 --> 3471.319
anyway

3486.88 --> 3492.96
what

3489.839 --> 3494.72
my week was a paramotoring lesson

3492.96 --> 3496.96
for your birthday from your girlfriend

3494.72 --> 3496.9599999999996
cool

3497.359 --> 3500.839
paramotoring

3499.359 --> 3503.44
is it like a

3500.839 --> 3507.119
parachute with a propeller

3503.44 --> 3507.119
basically that you're writing right

3514.319 --> 3517.319
cool

3525.68 --> 3530.44
wait what are you talking about matthew

3527.44 --> 3530.44
hall

3539.839 --> 3544.72
okay if that's

3542.16 --> 3546.64
is if matthew hall if that stream you're

3544.72 --> 3549.2
talking about you're digging up is as

3546.64 --> 3551.68
interesting as you say it is

3549.2 --> 3552.96
yeah then i might

3551.68 --> 3555.359
if it is

3552.96 --> 3557.68
might also be more

3555.359 --> 3559.839
transparent to me than to you

3557.68 --> 3561.68
we'll see but yeah you can always email

3559.839 --> 3564.88
that to me if you can't find it during

3561.68 --> 3566.3999999999996
this live stream matthew hall

3564.88 --> 3570.92
if you find it just send it through the

3566.4 --> 3570.92
email i'll check it out

3579.52 --> 3586.04
hello terminoid

3581.839 --> 3586.04
what's up with the golem

3605.04 --> 3607.839
what the [ __ ]

3608.4 --> 3610.799
really

3612.72 --> 3620.0
always reminds me of gollum

3615.92 --> 3620.0
well he is a bit of a hobbit isn't he

3620.799 --> 3626.4
he really would fit right in there

3623.68 --> 3629.359
in the shire

3626.4 --> 3632.559
i mean remember gollum it was just a

3629.359 --> 3635.7599999999998
halfling a hobbit so

3632.559 --> 3638.7200000000003
he does really seem a hobbit type

3635.76 --> 3641.3590000000004
and he might have had a a sniff of that

3638.72 --> 3643.5989999999997
ring at some point but he doesn't not as

3641.359 --> 3645.52
bad as gollum he hasn't been

3643.599 --> 3647.6800000000003
whole yeah keeping the ring for a

3645.52 --> 3649.359
thousand years

3647.68 --> 3652.839
or a hundred or however long that was

3649.359 --> 3652.839
supposed to be

3659.28 --> 3663.4
i lost in the mud flat

3673.2 --> 3677.7599999999998
i wonder if

3674.799 --> 3680.079
if martin actually realizes

3677.76 --> 3682.079
you know with that mud plot like what is

3680.079 --> 3684.319
being done i mean there's pictures being

3682.079 --> 3687.8390000000004
sent to him probably that he doesn't

3684.319 --> 3690.72
even realize like what they are

3687.839 --> 3692.48
i realize that by watching mine unveiled

3690.72 --> 3695.359
latest video

3692.48 --> 3696.88
that shows about well

3695.359 --> 3699.119
ais

3696.88 --> 3700.1600000000003
algorithms

3699.119 --> 3703.839
that

3700.16 --> 3707.04
can literally generate like fantastical

3703.839 --> 3710.0
artwork like imagery fantastical and can

3707.04 --> 3710.0
evolve even

3710.839 --> 3717.599
crazy and you can literally just say mud

3715.2 --> 3721.2
flood in that and work on the parameters

3717.599 --> 3723.839
until you can get extremely convincing

3721.2 --> 3727.0389999999998
footage pictures out of that

3723.839 --> 3729.0389999999998
that would just show look exactly like

3727.039 --> 3730.8390000000004
the type of [ __ ] martin litka would like

3729.039 --> 3734.7200000000003
to show you

3730.839 --> 3736.88
exactly like that it would be very hard

3734.72 --> 3739.68
to even see

3736.88 --> 3741.92
that it was just a computer algorithm

3739.68 --> 3743.7599999999998
generated thing because it had will have

3741.92 --> 3746.7200000000003
real

3743.76 --> 3746.7200000000003
visages

3746.96 --> 3750.079
because it's

3748.0 --> 3753.119
like infinitely edited or something i

3750.079 --> 3755.6800000000003
don't know how they've done that

3753.119 --> 3757.6800000000003
they just assimilated actual photographs

3755.68 --> 3759.2799999999997
so they have like probably those

3757.68 --> 3761.2
algorithms right

3759.28 --> 3763.039
probably have libraries of like

3761.2 --> 3765.52
thousands of different faces that they

3763.039 --> 3768.4
can just

3765.52 --> 3770.88
choose and recombine even and they are

3768.4 --> 3773.44
like actual photographed faces and it

3770.88 --> 3777.039
can be recombined in a way that you just

3773.44 --> 3779.28
cannot see that it's not real

3777.039 --> 3779.28
right

3781.039 --> 3785.5200000000004
that's out

3783.039 --> 3787.8390000000004
that's why you need to watch

3785.52 --> 3790.64
mind and phil's video and to to get to

3787.839 --> 3791.839
that realization like [ __ ] that [ __ ] is

3790.64 --> 3794.16
out there

3791.839 --> 3795.7599999999998
martin litka probably has some of those

3794.16 --> 3798.48
types of images

3795.76 --> 3800.559
and he doesn't even realize it or he

3798.48 --> 3802.88
might actually realize it and be a

3800.559 --> 3804.7200000000003
little grabbler and just use it to [ __ ]

3802.88 --> 3807.2000000000003
around with

3804.72 --> 3811.839
he might be realizing that he is just

3807.2 --> 3811.839
making it up i don't know for sure

3812.319 --> 3815.92
i mean he doesn't seem extremely

3814.16 --> 3818.24
inspired about the mud flood he's just

3815.92 --> 3820.0
always dropping it everywhere

3818.24 --> 3823.1189999999997
but he's not building like any

3820.0 --> 3825.359
persistent legend with it in his mind

3823.119 --> 3828.319
i mean still even kind of fluid as to

3825.359 --> 3829.7599999999998
what what even exactly happened

3828.319 --> 3832.319
so

3829.76 --> 3832.3190000000004
i don't know

3832.4 --> 3838.079
but that certainly did like

3835.44 --> 3840.64
made a little light go off in my head in

3838.079 --> 3843.44
a very unique place when i saw mine

3840.64 --> 3843.44
unveils video

3845.68 --> 3850.16
are you accusing martin luther faking

3847.76 --> 3853.3590000000004
his entire potentially

3850.16 --> 3857.1189999999997
and not all of it but he might have some

3853.359 --> 3859.0389999999998
imagery yeah that is fake

3857.119 --> 3860.2400000000002
but i don't know if he would be aware of

3859.039 --> 3862.4
that

3860.24 --> 3863.7599999999998
i mean he has a whole bunch of people

3862.4 --> 3865.28
that just kind of

3863.76 --> 3867.6800000000003
find stuff

3865.28 --> 3869.76
and forward it to him how does he know

3867.68 --> 3872.0789999999997
that there aren't just like

3869.76 --> 3876.0
straight out liars there that are part

3872.079 --> 3878.88
of like freemason programs to literally

3876.0 --> 3881.119
create the suggestions that need to be

3878.88 --> 3883.359
out there for all the people to

3881.119 --> 3885.2000000000003
assimilate in order to for social

3883.359 --> 3887.839
engineering purposes like how would

3885.2 --> 3889.7599999999998
martin even know

3887.839 --> 3890.5589999999997
if he had those types of people around

3889.76 --> 3893.44
him

3890.559 --> 3893.44
he wouldn't know

3893.839 --> 3899.599
he probably didn't doesn't want to know

3897.359 --> 3903.0389999999998
it's extremely uncomfortable

3899.599 --> 3904.88
realizing that when you don't have

3903.039 --> 3908.0
like

3904.88 --> 3909.76
cohesion sharpness oversight sharpness

3908.0 --> 3913.599
as much

3909.76 --> 3917.1600000000003
so just probably all lets it happen

3913.599 --> 3917.1600000000003
that's what i think

3927.2 --> 3930.799
yeah

3927.92 --> 3934.839
306 i think there's a good likelihood of

3930.799 --> 3934.839
that i really do

3936.24 --> 3941.839
i mean the guy literally just shows

3938.64 --> 3944.0789999999997
everything whatever he bumps into

3941.839 --> 3947.16
if he's like oh that's cool she'll just

3944.079 --> 3950.559
show he does not have any kind of

3947.16 --> 3953.0389999999998
priorities in what he like he doesn't

3950.559 --> 3954.96
he effectively don't know if he

3953.039 --> 3956.48
internally does but effectively he just

3954.96 --> 3957.599
doesn't care it's just like oh this

3956.48 --> 3960.0
looks cool

3957.599 --> 3962.2400000000002
there you go blah blah blah blah blah

3960.0 --> 3966.559
that's what he does every time like he

3962.24 --> 3966.5589999999997
doesn't care really

3967.359 --> 3971.839
he just oh this is cool i'm gonna show

3969.599 --> 3973.839
this that's it

3971.839 --> 3975.119
he doesn't really know

3973.839 --> 3978.48
what it is

3975.119 --> 3981.119
if it's real if he's being [ __ ] with

3978.48 --> 3981.119
he doesn't know

3983.2 --> 3988.24
i mean half the time he can't even life

3986.48 --> 3990.48
distinguish

3988.24 --> 3993.0389999999998
actual photographs

3990.48 --> 3997.28
from paintings

3993.039 --> 3998.48
i can instantly instantly i very trained

3997.28 --> 4000.6400000000003
to do that

3998.48 --> 4004.599
he doesn't see

4000.64 --> 4004.5989999999997
he doesn't see it

4016.799 --> 4020.28
right anyway

4021.68 --> 4024.72
so yeah

4022.96 --> 4027.359
you want to test

4024.72 --> 4029.68
my suspicion

4027.359 --> 4032.319
go watch martin lead kiss tonight i mean

4029.68 --> 4035.5989999999997
it is flatter day

4032.319 --> 4037.599
he does his stream this evening

4035.599 --> 4039.839
and there's no ball busters or anything

4037.599 --> 4039.839
so

4040.4 --> 4047.52
so just check it out and and test this

4044.4 --> 4049.839
give yourself a challenge see if you can

4047.52 --> 4049.839
detect

4049.92 --> 4054.079
like what the imagery is i mean that is

4052.24 --> 4056.0789999999997
kind of what i did

4054.079 --> 4058.48
the last few times that it even went to

4056.079 --> 4059.6800000000003
that stream it was just purely for that

4058.48 --> 4061.28
it's just like

4059.68 --> 4062.96
i'm just here

4061.28 --> 4065.6800000000003
to have images

4062.96 --> 4068.48
exchange in front of my face and so that

4065.68 --> 4071.7599999999998
i can instantly analyze what this is is

4068.48 --> 4073.599
this a painting this is a design sketch

4071.76 --> 4075.5200000000004
because there are those two design

4073.599 --> 4077.839
sketch of buildings that weren't

4075.52 --> 4079.92
actually made but that might have had

4077.839 --> 4082.0789999999997
been built

4079.92 --> 4084.48
they could have built it but they didn't

4082.079 --> 4087.76
right all those details

4084.48 --> 4091.119
computer generated hand-painted is it

4087.76 --> 4096.2390000000005
actually old is it like a

4091.119 --> 4098.799
inspired on old sort of a remake a

4096.239 --> 4100.879999999999
an attempt to mimic old

4098.799 --> 4105.04
through art

4100.88 --> 4107.92
or ai like all those factors all those

4105.04 --> 4110.319
factors i just like bang

4107.92 --> 4112.159
what is this

4110.319 --> 4114.64
it's this

4112.159 --> 4115.92
that's what i'd used to do of red martin

4114.64 --> 4118.159000000001
luther's

4115.92 --> 4120.08
like don't listen to what the [ __ ] he's

4118.159 --> 4122.639999999999
saying it's all [ __ ]

4120.08 --> 4124.799
just look at it what are you looking at

4122.64 --> 4126.0
processes what is this what you're

4124.799 --> 4128.48
looking at

4126.0 --> 4130.719
be quick

4128.48 --> 4133.718999999999
that's what i used to do it was

4130.719 --> 4133.719
interesting

4140.719 --> 4143.679
hey

4141.679 --> 4146.4
guns have never owned r p good to see

4143.679 --> 4148.4800000000005
you

4146.4 --> 4150.5599999999995
how am i these days well i've been very

4148.48 --> 4152.718999999999
hot

4150.56 --> 4155.359
in the last month but now it's cooling

4152.719 --> 4158.92
down a bit so

4155.359 --> 4158.92
i'm doing fine

4162.0 --> 4165.279
could use some support

4167.679 --> 4171.4400000000005
but yeah other than that i'm doing great

4173.6 --> 4175.839
uh

4179.04 --> 4184.44
wow

4180.0 --> 4184.44
probably already been going in an hour

4192.319 --> 4197.04
so yeah if you like what i talk about

4194.719 --> 4200.159
like my subjects

4197.04 --> 4200.159
like my analysis

4200.4 --> 4203.92
then please

4201.679 --> 4205.92
donate to my paypal

4203.92 --> 4207.4400000000005

4211.44 --> 4214.879999999999
stress

4213.44 --> 4217.839999999999
so that i can just

4214.88 --> 4217.84
do my show

4218.64 --> 4221.4400000000005
without

4219.679 --> 4224.4
constantly worrying about that sort of

4221.44 --> 4226.5599999999995
nonsense which to me it is nonsense i

4224.4 --> 4228.32
hate it i hate worrying about money i'm

4226.56 --> 4231.84
not good at it i don't want to be good

4228.32 --> 4231.84
at it i just want to do this

4233.04 --> 4235.28
oh

4235.92 --> 4241.679
you get to utrec bring some

4238.64 --> 4241.679
okay voynich

4243.44 --> 4245.839999999999
cool

4247.199 --> 4251.36
sure well you could technically drop it

4249.84 --> 4252.159000000001
in the mailbox

4251.36 --> 4255.04
well

4252.159 --> 4257.04
in an envelope with my name or

4255.04 --> 4259.84
at least

4257.04 --> 4259.84
that will be great

4265.04 --> 4271.719
but sure if paypal doesn't work out for

4267.12 --> 4271.719
you then yeah whatever

4272.56 --> 4275.92
i mean i'm still in the mail

4276.08 --> 4281.6
almost forgotten with jado

4278.56 --> 4282.96
like he sent a bank transfer

4281.6 --> 4287.8
to me

4282.96 --> 4287.8
i think that's now over a month ago

4290.88 --> 4296.0
so that doesn't really seem to be

4292.719 --> 4296.0
working out just great

4298.4 --> 4301.799999999999
let me check

4312.88 --> 4321.36
whoa 15th of july

4316.719 --> 4321.36
yeah so that's over a month ago

4322.32 --> 4325.04
ridiculous

4326.159 --> 4329.44
don't feed the trolls feed the irwin ah

4328.4 --> 4332.08
yes

4329.44 --> 4336.159
indeed thank you for the super chat

4332.08 --> 4336.159
matthew hall much appreciated

4338.56 --> 4342.4800000000005
yeah and tarat

4340.239 --> 4344.879999999999
306 you like martin

4342.48 --> 4346.879999999999
dude i'm not telling you not to like him

4344.88 --> 4348.88
i'm just telling you

4346.88 --> 4351.52
if you're looking for intellectual

4348.88 --> 4354.32
stimulation then i wouldn't be

4351.52 --> 4355.4400000000005
using him

4354.32 --> 4359.04
like

4355.44 --> 4361.599999999999
his for his verbal qualities

4359.04 --> 4361.6
but yeah

4362.0 --> 4369.0
i mean i kind of like him but i kind of

4364.4 --> 4369.0
know he's also a bit of a scoundrel

4371.84 --> 4375.679
hey charlie and cat good to see you

4382.0 --> 4385.92
right yeah that's right terry through i

4383.76 --> 4389.04
mean he's done a lot of flat earth

4385.92 --> 4393.28
videos and live streams in the past too

4389.04 --> 4395.6
i mean martin litke is a a first wave

4393.28 --> 4399.0
he's been doing stuff with that

4395.6 --> 4399.0
since the beginning

4404.8 --> 4409.12
right but from flat earth he's just

4406.96 --> 4412.4
really jumped onto this mud flood and

4409.12 --> 4414.48
just oh look at all the old paintings

4412.4 --> 4415.44
buildings paintings what happened in the

4414.48 --> 4419.799999999999
past

4415.44 --> 4419.799999999999
and that's really his stick now

4436.32 --> 4438.639999999999
hey

4438.84 --> 4444.32
godzilla did you watch with it yesterday

4447.679 --> 4451.84
yeah

4448.96 --> 4455.52
i did not watch with it yesterday but i

4451.84 --> 4456.96
have heard through the guys

4455.52 --> 4460.080000000001
on fed

4456.96 --> 4461.92
that whitsits gone full ethereum he

4460.08 --> 4463.6
wants to be an etherean champion

4461.92 --> 4465.4400000000005
apparently now

4463.6 --> 4468.4800000000005
so yeah

4465.44 --> 4471.12
we'll see we'll see how long he lasts i

4468.48 --> 4473.199
mean he can't win it's an aberration he

4471.12 --> 4475.679
can never win

4473.199 --> 4479.44
we'll see how long he lasts i mean i had

4475.679 --> 4479.4400000000005
my moment with gravity remember

4480.56 --> 4485.1990000000005
in time qe join and all that i had and

4482.88 --> 4489.1990000000005
that lasted like half a year

4485.199 --> 4491.5199999999995
i was very like no this is real

4489.199 --> 4493.44
or a summer another half year was like a

4491.52 --> 4495.4400000000005
few months or something but i held on to

4493.44 --> 4497.678999999999
that very long i gave it my oh i was

4495.44 --> 4500.239
also like angry sometimes even at the

4497.679 --> 4502.56
guys like don't treat me like this

4500.239 --> 4503.44
now that's very serious so

4502.56 --> 4506.0
right

4503.44 --> 4508.639999999999
which it might be doing that now with

4506.0 --> 4512.159
ether he's like no i insist it's real

4508.64 --> 4512.159000000001
i'm i'm gonna be the champion

4513.52 --> 4519.4800000000005
right so we'll see what happens

4516.08 --> 4519.48
it's his life

4550.4 --> 4553.44
yeah

4551.44 --> 4555.199
yeah that's weird

4553.44 --> 4559.32
that is odd

4555.199 --> 4559.32
almost forgotten about that

4575.84 --> 4579.96
never like what's it okay

4581.76 --> 4586.88
i kind of like him but yeah i mean if

4584.4 --> 4589.12
he's going all the way over here yeah i

4586.88 --> 4591.76
mean he's just gonna be like another

4589.12 --> 4594.0
right to hand or something right

4591.76 --> 4596.4800000000005
some of you might even remember who that

4594.0 --> 4596.48
is but

4598.48 --> 4600.239
i mean

4599.36 --> 4602.48
he

4600.239 --> 4604.718999999999
which it reminded me of right to hand a

4602.48 --> 4604.718999999999
lot

4604.88 --> 4610.4800000000005
right the hand is actually pretty freaky

4607.199 --> 4613.04
smart he's just so incredibly compulsive

4610.48 --> 4614.639999999999
he have absolutely no control over his

4613.04 --> 4617.679
emotions and

4614.64 --> 4620.400000000001
his emotions literally rule his social

4617.679 --> 4622.96
endeavors and that is a terrible thing

4620.4 --> 4625.599999999999
to him

4622.96 --> 4627.52
right and i always saw him very similar

4625.6 --> 4630.88
to which that except which it does have

4627.52 --> 4630.88
like control over that

4632.0 --> 4634.239
but

4635.12 --> 4640.88
if he's gonna do this then

4638.4 --> 4640.879999999999
i don't know

4649.6 --> 4653.360000000001
trust them yeah

4651.52 --> 4654.719
well good on you because they aren't

4653.36 --> 4658.4
trustworthy

4654.719 --> 4658.4
i don't really trust them either

4663.12 --> 4665.92
i mean i trust

4664.48 --> 4668.08
them enough

4665.92 --> 4669.84
i it's basically i trust them as far as

4668.08 --> 4671.12
i can throw them and i can throw them

4669.84 --> 4672.88
quite a bit

4671.12 --> 4675.599999999999
i mean i've gotten to know them in an

4672.88 --> 4678.32
indirect sense i got to figure them out

4675.6 --> 4681.04
i know what i could expect of the things

4678.32 --> 4682.719
that i don't know about them

4681.04 --> 4685.36
yeah it's what i do

4682.719 --> 4687.04
figuring out that which i don't know and

4685.36 --> 4690.08
then being able to predict that

4687.04 --> 4692.08
accurately like an actual ether that

4690.08 --> 4693.199
does actually exist and every time works

4692.08 --> 4696.159
always

4693.199 --> 4698.0
except i'm not claiming anything is any

4696.159 --> 4701.28
physical thing about it

4698.0 --> 4701.28
it's just a procedure

4703.76 --> 4707.8
now i lost my train of thought

4712.32 --> 4717.04
right yeah i i get the glow busters team

4715.04 --> 4720.239
and all that

4717.04 --> 4721.28
i know they they don't respect me not

4720.239 --> 4723.44
really

4721.28 --> 4724.96
because they never mention me

4723.44 --> 4727.599999999999
ever

4724.96 --> 4727.6
like ever

4728.64 --> 4733.6
like oh i've only ever heard like bob

4731.52 --> 4734.719
mention me and then every time it's

4733.6 --> 4737.52
angry

4734.719 --> 4738.64
every time

4737.52 --> 4741.84
he never

4738.64 --> 4744.56
no nobody out there the guys nobody ever

4741.84 --> 4746.400000000001
references me david weiss has never

4744.56 --> 4748.2390000000005
referenced me

4746.4 --> 4751.12
ever

4748.239 --> 4752.799999999999
not nobody else out there

4751.12 --> 4754.8
pretty much the only one i do know that

4752.8 --> 4756.88
actually references me

4754.8 --> 4758.2390000000005
is nathan oakley

4756.88 --> 4761.52
and

4758.239 --> 4764.08
jim bob actually has he just like

4761.52 --> 4767.52
puts my text on screen and he calls me

4764.08 --> 4768.719
out he's actually watched my shows

4767.52 --> 4771.1990000000005
yeah

4768.719 --> 4774.159
it seems like people out there that are

4771.199 --> 4777.839999999999
flat earthers don't even watch anything

4774.159 --> 4780.239
i do at all they made up their mind

4777.84 --> 4782.56
about me probably in some way that i've

4780.239 --> 4785.678999999999
gone too far you can't do this that

4782.56 --> 4785.679
could never be right

4787.76 --> 4792.320000000001
because i never get a mention ever and

4790.48 --> 4795.04
i've complained about this because i

4792.32 --> 4798.48
freaking deserve a mention oh yeah i do

4795.04 --> 4798.48
in many different ways

4798.8 --> 4802.320000000001
because i bring up things

4800.88 --> 4806.0
that are

4802.32 --> 4807.84
the practical truth of your future

4806.0 --> 4810.48
the ideas that i've come up with and

4807.84 --> 4813.679
that i'm still coming up with are the

4810.48 --> 4813.678999999999
future reality

4814.96 --> 4820.159
i'm figuring out the reality the

4817.679 --> 4822.08
holographic non-local nature of the

4820.159 --> 4824.32
celestials which i'm pretty much the

4822.08 --> 4827.44
only person on the entire freaking

4824.32 --> 4829.679
internet that just says this is what it

4827.44 --> 4831.599999999999
is this is how it works

4829.679 --> 4833.84
this is it this is it this is how it

4831.6 --> 4833.84
works

4835.6 --> 4841.4400000000005
and i never even get a reference nobody

4838.639 --> 4843.4400000000005
even says my name

4841.44 --> 4845.759999999999
if they want to bring up something in

4843.44 --> 4848.48
that direction if any suggestion like oh

4845.76 --> 4850.400000000001
maybe it's not actually a thing in a

4848.48 --> 4853.5199999999995
physical place

4850.4 --> 4855.36
yeah how revolutionary yeah yeah hi hi

4853.52 --> 4858.320000000001
i'm arwin

4855.36 --> 4860.48
i brought that out i came up with that

4858.32 --> 4863.199
or discovered it if you will because i

4860.48 --> 4865.599999999999
didn't make it up i think that is real

4863.199 --> 4870.08
and i figured that out and came out with

4865.6 --> 4873.6
it in 2016 2015 in chat 2016 in my

4870.08 --> 4876.8
channel have talked about it ever since

4873.6 --> 4879.120000000001
developed it further refined it

4876.8 --> 4880.639
further got misconceptions out of the

4879.12 --> 4884.5599999999995
way

4880.639 --> 4889.36
yeah i've done that non-stop non-stop

4884.56 --> 4892.080000000001
do i ever get any reference for it no

4889.36 --> 4894.32
never even heard anybody say my name in

4892.08 --> 4897.28
relation to that concept even though

4894.32 --> 4899.679
very distinctly i am the one that

4897.28 --> 4902.719
brought that out in the public

4899.679 --> 4904.639
as a speaking point as a realization as

4902.719 --> 4907.36
is something that is worth discovering

4904.639 --> 4910.2390000000005
and conceptualizing because i think it

4907.36 --> 4912.159
is the truth and i am kind of very

4910.239 --> 4915.718999999999
confident that i will turn out to be

4912.159 --> 4915.719
correct in this

4918.4 --> 4922.44
a reference would be nice

4940.48 --> 4944.799999999999
what the [ __ ] no i don't know what the

4942.639 --> 4947.04
hell you're talking about the goods have

4944.8 --> 4950.400000000001
absolutely no idea what the [ __ ] that

4947.04 --> 4950.4
has to do with anything

4952.0 --> 4956.88
if that is even true you're not just

4954.32 --> 4959.84
randomly spamming some nonsense in my

4956.88 --> 4959.84
chat

4999.44 --> 5004.0
hmm

5000.719 --> 5007.36
gravity sickness what the hell

5004.0 --> 5007.36
ever been to rotterdam yes

5013.199 --> 5016.159
i've been in most places in the

5014.88 --> 5017.36
netherlands

5016.159 --> 5020.638999999999
well

5017.36 --> 5020.639
no not literally

5021.12 --> 5024.719
i've been

5022.159 --> 5028.32
all over the netherlands not everywhere

5024.719 --> 5030.719
but in a lot of places

5028.32 --> 5033.599999999999
i've seen every province

5030.719 --> 5033.6
at least once

5036.4 --> 5043.199
yeah clearly yeah but just saying

5039.12 --> 5045.5199999999995
welcome to flat earth is really cool

5043.199 --> 5049.839999999999
but that doesn't actually mean anything

5045.52 --> 5051.6
though it's just a cool thing to say

5049.84 --> 5053.84
right

5051.6 --> 5056.56
i mean i don't expect to like

5053.84 --> 5059.52
sit i don't expect for example people to

5056.56 --> 5062.400000000001
start saying it's the arwynian paradox i

5059.52 --> 5064.2390000000005
expect it over at fed

5062.4 --> 5066.48
but that's not the thing

5064.239 --> 5069.44
that i'm even talking about i don't even

5066.48 --> 5071.839999999999
like the technical details and all that

5069.44 --> 5073.599999999999
in the paradoxes and even my physicality

5071.84 --> 5075.76
assumption bias

5073.6 --> 5077.1990000000005
i would love it if people credited me

5075.76 --> 5080.159000000001
for that

5077.199 --> 5081.28
don't expect that

5080.159 --> 5084.32
however

5081.28 --> 5086.639
when it comes to the realization that

5084.32 --> 5089.199
the celestial bodies are non-local

5086.639 --> 5094.0
holograms oh yes

5089.199 --> 5097.44
on that one i definitely want the credit

5094.0 --> 5099.679
because i have been very much distinctly

5097.44 --> 5102.0
one of the people

5099.679 --> 5105.6
that have brought that idea exactly as

5102.0 --> 5108.4
is no mysteries even just statement

5105.6 --> 5112.320000000001
they're holograms it's a hologram yeah

5108.4 --> 5115.12
i've taken a lot a lot of flack

5112.32 --> 5116.719
including from flat earthers that said i

5115.12 --> 5118.88
was just trying to make them look

5116.719 --> 5121.28
ridiculous over that yeah it's still

5118.88 --> 5125.28
happening

5121.28 --> 5127.5199999999995
so i want some god damn [ __ ] credit

5125.28 --> 5129.679
for that i've done that

5127.52 --> 5132.2390000000005
and introduced that piece of

5129.679 --> 5134.4
consciousness in the public

5132.239 --> 5136.718999999999
extremely early when nobody was ready

5134.4 --> 5139.04
for it because that's the only time to

5136.719 --> 5142.159
do it

5139.04 --> 5144.159
early so that can grow on people and i

5142.159 --> 5147.28
want some credit

5144.159 --> 5147.28
for the discovery

5149.76 --> 5152.639
yeah

5150.639 --> 5155.76
well everybody out there is like oh this

5152.639 --> 5158.88
guy's so genius he said that it might be

5155.76 --> 5162.08
plasma this one might be blood oh that's

5158.88 --> 5165.28
so cool oh you figured out yeah it's a

5162.08 --> 5168.32
[ __ ] hologram all those people all

5165.28 --> 5170.719
talking [ __ ] all of them never even

5168.32 --> 5173.36
figured out like oh maybe it's not a

5170.719 --> 5176.32
physical thing yeah not a genius not a

5173.36 --> 5177.44
genius all a bunch of physicists that

5176.32 --> 5180.0
are just

5177.44 --> 5182.879999999999
applying their physicality assumption by

5180.0 --> 5185.6
to somehow make it an object in their

5182.88 --> 5188.08
mind in the physical world that's what

5185.6 --> 5190.88
they did and they were wrong and i

5188.08 --> 5194.239
figured this out and that started when i

5190.88 --> 5196.88
was like 12 or 15. i didn't even know

5194.239 --> 5199.759999999999
how to translate what i was realizing at

5196.88 --> 5201.1990000000005
the time just kept it to myself like a

5199.76 --> 5204.4800000000005
little candle

5201.199 --> 5204.48
going through the darkness

5205.84 --> 5211.84
yeah

5208.08 --> 5211.84
i want some damn credit for that

5212.08 --> 5219.12
because it is real it is the reality it

5215.92 --> 5221.36
will be established that it is real that

5219.12 --> 5223.679
the celestials are holographic and

5221.36 --> 5227.199
they're not in literal positions

5223.679 --> 5228.32
anywhere there is no location for any of

5227.199 --> 5230.799999999999
them

5228.32 --> 5233.679
they're all angular

5230.8 --> 5235.159000000001
optical manifestations

5233.679 --> 5238.96
holograms

5235.159 --> 5241.599999999999
non-local holograms i am certain of this

5238.96 --> 5244.56
certain enough to put a definition like

5241.6 --> 5246.96
that down right here

5244.56 --> 5249.04
and in the future when i'm gonna turn

5246.96 --> 5251.679
out to be right i want some goddamn

5249.04 --> 5253.84
credit for calling this yeah

5251.679 --> 5256.08
well everybody else is all silent and

5253.84 --> 5258.8
all squirting over their physicality

5256.08 --> 5263.48
assumption biases yeah i was a goddamn

5258.8 --> 5263.4800000000005
credit for putting down the reality

5272.76 --> 5275.959
[Music]

5277.76 --> 5282.639
no

5278.719 --> 5282.639
yes 13 [ __ ] off

5286.0 --> 5292.159
true holograms no the statement is

5289.52 --> 5295.040000000001
what it is it is what it is it is what

5292.159 --> 5298.159
it is it is what it is

5295.04 --> 5300.08
prove me wrong and we'll talk yeah with

5298.159 --> 5302.48
your [ __ ] little physicality

5300.08 --> 5304.96
assumption bias [ __ ]

5302.48 --> 5307.5199999999995
that's a claim you claim it's there is

5304.96 --> 5311.04
something it's something specific an

5307.52 --> 5313.360000000001
object in a place [ __ ] prove it yeah

5311.04 --> 5316.32
now you prove that to me

5313.36 --> 5319.5199999999995
through approach through angular size

5316.32 --> 5320.96
increase through radiation increase of

5319.52 --> 5323.76
heat or whatever

5320.96 --> 5326.32
you go and prove that to me and then

5323.76 --> 5329.679
then i might actually say like oh [ __ ]

5326.32 --> 5332.08
man i was totally wrong about about that

5329.679 --> 5334.2390000000005
non-local hologram thing damn it there

5332.08 --> 5336.239
was actually a sun in a specific

5334.239 --> 5338.159
position you can approach it and and

5336.239 --> 5340.5599999999995
then equipment will even melt because of

5338.159 --> 5342.799999999999
the proximity damn it i was wrong

5340.56 --> 5345.360000000001
[ __ ] do it then

5342.8 --> 5345.360000000001
do it

5346.239 --> 5352.5599999999995
go icarus go prove me wrong icarus prove

5350.56 --> 5354.8
me wrong

5352.56 --> 5357.52
i'm not gonna [ __ ] do it

5354.8 --> 5361.719
because it's not my claim my claim is

5357.52 --> 5361.719
that you can't approach it

5391.679 --> 5396.56
yeah i know pjc knit i know a lot of you

5394.08 --> 5398.639
guys here in my chat get it and when i'm

5396.56 --> 5400.080000000001
blasting off like that that's not to you

5398.639 --> 5401.92
personally that's my personal

5400.08 --> 5403.28
frustration to the rest of this [ __ ]

5401.92 --> 5404.8
world

5403.28 --> 5409.28
it's all just holding on to their

5404.8 --> 5409.28
[ __ ] physicality assumption bias

5409.36 --> 5414.5599999999995
like a bunch of babies in a [ __ ] like

5411.84 --> 5416.8
playing with balls that's what it is

5414.56 --> 5420.320000000001
just can't let go of that it must be a

5416.8 --> 5424.08
physical thing with physical no it's not

5420.32 --> 5426.08
prove it then prove it's physical

5424.08 --> 5428.0
prove it's there prove it as a proximity

5426.08 --> 5431.28
prove the angular size increase prove it

5428.0 --> 5433.6
prove it prove it or shut the [ __ ] up

5431.28 --> 5436.159
don't call me stupid

5433.6 --> 5438.639
for assuming it's a non-local hologram

5436.159 --> 5443.239
when you have absolutely no proof of

5438.639 --> 5443.2390000000005
anything physical in any location

5456.719 --> 5461.84
and prove either

5459.36 --> 5463.28
you can't prove either

5461.84 --> 5464.96
yeah you can

5463.28 --> 5466.32
there's something there there's energy

5464.96 --> 5468.639
being received

5466.32 --> 5471.759999999999
so if you can't prove a location if you

5468.639 --> 5474.84
can't approach it if it stays elusive

5471.76 --> 5477.679
that means there's only one

5474.84 --> 5480.719
logical conceivable

5477.679 --> 5483.84
train of thought left to follow and that

5480.719 --> 5487.84
means it's a non-local hologram there is

5483.84 --> 5491.6
no other conception conceived by people

5487.84 --> 5495.28
to explain it with

5491.6 --> 5497.120000000001
you can thank me for finding one

5495.28 --> 5498.4
that is actually

5497.12 --> 5500.239
the truth

5498.4 --> 5503.199
and not just another physicality

5500.239 --> 5505.839999999999
assumption juggling ball yeah you can

5503.199 --> 5505.839999999999
thank me for that

5511.04 --> 5517.04
eric's also works what is eric's

5515.36 --> 5519.839999999999
gorzilla what the hell are you talking

5517.04 --> 5519.84
about

5537.36 --> 5541.36
the jump to hologram seems arbitrary no

5539.44 --> 5543.599999999999
it isn't and it is in the jump it was

5541.36 --> 5545.12
always a hologram

5543.6 --> 5548.400000000001
the jump was

5545.12 --> 5552.159
making it physical in people's mind that

5548.4 --> 5555.199
was the jump that was always the jump

5552.159 --> 5556.32
yeah it was the leap downward the leap

5555.199 --> 5559.36
to hell

5556.32 --> 5562.0
when the angels fell

5559.36 --> 5565.28
yeah that's the leap downwards

5562.0 --> 5568.4
the assumption they're physical

5565.28 --> 5569.5199999999995
instead of energy instead of divinely

5568.4 --> 5572.08
created

5569.52 --> 5574.56
now it became physical

5572.08 --> 5576.639
and with that physicality assumption

5574.56 --> 5579.04
bias the exclusion

5576.639 --> 5580.88
of spiritual

5579.04 --> 5582.56
and divine

5580.88 --> 5585.1990000000005
materialism

5582.56 --> 5588.56
yeah materialism physicality assumption

5585.199 --> 5590.879999999999
bias go hand in hand every step every

5588.56 --> 5590.88
step

5600.719 --> 5605.92
hologram theory is amazing experiments

5602.719 --> 5605.92
no you can't do that

5606.0 --> 5609.84
i mean

5607.04 --> 5610.88
i can prove it's not actually there

5609.84 --> 5613.92
where the

5610.88 --> 5616.400000000001
positions seem to line up virtually with

5613.92 --> 5619.04
the presupposition of a disc

5616.4 --> 5621.679
that doesn't automatically prove

5619.04 --> 5621.679
what it is

5621.76 --> 5630.08
i mean the only way to prove a hologram

5625.04 --> 5632.8
is a hologram is by turning it off

5630.08 --> 5634.639
you really want me to do that you really

5632.8 --> 5638.96
want me to [ __ ] turn off the

5634.639 --> 5641.28
celestials just to make a [ __ ] point

5638.96 --> 5641.28
dude

5641.84 --> 5647.679
how about just settling for this is what

5645.04 --> 5650.8
it is this is what it has to be there is

5647.679 --> 5653.84
no other train of thought that has ever

5650.8 --> 5657.0
been conceived in order to follow it to

5653.84 --> 5657.0
a conclusion

5659.92 --> 5664.159
[ __ ] off why don't you go [ __ ] off you

5662.8 --> 5666.8
scum

5664.159 --> 5668.799999999999
turn them off [ __ ] off

5666.8 --> 5672.2390000000005
it's not even funny

5668.8 --> 5674.2390000000005
it's not even [ __ ] funny but you

5672.239 --> 5676.799999999999
think you're all just a bunch of [ __ ]

5674.239 --> 5679.44
little wannabe gods don't you

5676.8 --> 5682.320000000001
oh well we're just oh but we gotta do it

5679.44 --> 5684.879999999999
just turn it off go [ __ ] yourself

5682.32 --> 5687.119
yeah how about we don't

5684.88 --> 5690.159000000001
mess or even attempt to mess with the

5687.119 --> 5692.88
rudiments with the rudimentaries

5690.159 --> 5695.599999999999
the very essential foundations of

5692.88 --> 5697.84
existence how about we don't [ __ ] around

5695.6 --> 5700.2390000000005
with that just to please a bunch of

5697.84 --> 5702.88
arrogant pieces of [ __ ] that want

5700.239 --> 5704.5599999999995
[ __ ] proof for anything because they

5702.88 --> 5706.400000000001
grew up in a world where they were

5704.56 --> 5708.719
taught that everybody knows everything

5706.4 --> 5710.4
because we're all squirt boys now in

5708.719 --> 5711.36
space

5710.4 --> 5713.5199999999995
yeah

5711.36 --> 5716.5599999999995
well why don't you go [ __ ] yourself and

5713.52 --> 5719.4400000000005
just stop this ridiculous

5716.56 --> 5721.4400000000005
inquiry we don't turn off the celestials

5719.44 --> 5722.96
to prove they're real

5721.44 --> 5726.36
okay

5722.96 --> 5726.36
this is ridiculous

5734.32 --> 5739.28
where are the holograms being projected

5736.08 --> 5740.8
from is the question yeah well

5739.28 --> 5742.96
i don't know man

5740.8 --> 5745.119000000001
i think they're just manifested i don't

5742.96 --> 5748.639
think there's it's not even like a

5745.119 --> 5750.639
projector like technology that is being

5748.639 --> 5752.32
applied because they're non-local we

5750.639 --> 5755.84
don't know how to make non-local

5752.32 --> 5758.159
holograms it's [ __ ] freaky

5755.84 --> 5762.2390000000005
holograms that literally move with you

5758.159 --> 5764.879999999999
everywhere yeah we can't make that

5762.239 --> 5764.879999999999
we can't

5765.6 --> 5769.84
so

5767.199 --> 5771.5199999999995
i think it is a manifestation i think it

5769.84 --> 5773.6
is literally

5771.52 --> 5775.360000000001
physically unattainable

5773.6 --> 5777.4400000000005
to figure it out i think it is a

5775.36 --> 5779.679
mechanism of the heaven it's in the

5777.44 --> 5781.5199999999995
sixth dimension it's a giant clockwork

5779.679 --> 5785.4
system giant

5781.52 --> 5785.400000000001
deer thing

5787.52 --> 5791.92
you can't prove it within the third

5789.28 --> 5791.92
dimension

5793.199 --> 5796.96
that's what i think of course i can't

5795.119 --> 5800.719
prove that

5796.96 --> 5803.04
but i'm just like why why do you have to

5800.719 --> 5804.2390000000005
[ __ ] prove everything in the physical

5803.04 --> 5807.04
world

5804.239 --> 5809.839999999999
just to just to step away from your

5807.04 --> 5810.719
freaking balls court behavior

5809.84 --> 5812.8
i mean

5810.719 --> 5813.92
can't you just realize it's the only

5812.8 --> 5816.2390000000005
option

5813.92 --> 5817.92
there is no other conceivable option

5816.239 --> 5820.48
everything else that has ever been

5817.92 --> 5821.36
conceived always leads

5820.48 --> 5824.239
to

5821.36 --> 5826.239
a thing in a place

5824.239 --> 5827.919999999999
it is a thing yeah physicality

5826.239 --> 5831.759999999999
assumption bias and

5827.92 --> 5832.56
no evidence will lead to that

5831.76 --> 5834.2390000000005
yeah

5832.56 --> 5835.84
or would you like to prove me wrong

5834.239 --> 5837.839999999999
icarus

5835.84 --> 5840.32
where when are you going to go out and

5837.84 --> 5842.719
prove me wrong icarus prove me wrong

5840.32 --> 5845.28
show it to me show me that i'm wrong

5842.719 --> 5846.4800000000005
show me that there is a physical object

5845.28 --> 5850.0
there

5846.48 --> 5852.32
show it to me come on then icarus go

5850.0 --> 5854.8
i'm waiting i'm waiting to be proven

5852.32 --> 5858.04
wrong by you icarus go ahead prove me

5854.8 --> 5858.04
wrong icarus

5867.48 --> 5870.509999999999
[Music]

5880.88 --> 5886.88
i don't know why a hologram would look

5882.96 --> 5890.08
like that well maybe because it could ai

5886.88 --> 5891.04
maybe because god was like hey

5890.08 --> 5894.159
oh

5891.04 --> 5896.8
yeah by the way if you think that you

5894.159 --> 5899.199
can be god like me

5896.8 --> 5901.1990000000005
and use the celestials like that i'm

5899.199 --> 5903.599999999999
gonna throw a little spanner in the

5901.199 --> 5906.08
works and give you a really big [ __ ]

5903.6 --> 5908.639
challenge i'm gonna make you think

5906.08 --> 5911.04
it's a physical thing starting with the

5908.639 --> 5913.119
moon yeah so you're going to stare at

5911.04 --> 5915.28
the heavens and imagine

5913.119 --> 5917.5199999999995
what that might be

5915.28 --> 5920.719
based on your human physicality

5917.52 --> 5922.4800000000005
assumption biases well get ready

5920.719 --> 5924.96
for satan

5922.48 --> 5928.159
because that's where that ends yeah and

5924.96 --> 5932.0
i think even when for example jesus

5928.159 --> 5935.679
warned not to get into astrology

5932.0 --> 5936.84
i think that is kind of that effect it's

5935.679 --> 5940.4800000000005
just like

5936.84 --> 5942.639
don't stare too much at that don't start

5940.48 --> 5945.28
imagining what that might be like

5942.639 --> 5947.28
another place because you will

5945.28 --> 5949.679
enter heliocentrism

5947.28 --> 5952.32
which then leads to the philosophy of

5949.679 --> 5954.88
atheism and materialism

5952.32 --> 5954.88
satan

5955.679 --> 5959.6
that's actually what i think he was

5958.239 --> 5962.0
pointing at

5959.6 --> 5964.4800000000005
because he was not super specific about

5962.0 --> 5964.48
it you see

5965.44 --> 5972.239
he didn't say like never go to an

5967.92 --> 5972.2390000000005
astrologer and ask for like a reading

5972.48 --> 5975.678999999999
no he's just like don't do that don't

5974.719 --> 5977.6
just

5975.679 --> 5979.76
leave all that alone that's what it

5977.6 --> 5982.56
sounded like to me

5979.76 --> 5982.56
when i read that

5990.32 --> 5993.28
right because that's where the

5991.52 --> 5994.88
astrologers deal with with the

5993.28 --> 5996.88
celestials

5994.88 --> 5999.119
you're then gonna have that be turned

5996.88 --> 6001.76
into astronomy

5999.119 --> 6004.719
that's when suddenly the invocation of

6001.76 --> 6006.88
physicality assumption bias enters the

6004.719 --> 6010.0
game and actually they're all objects

6006.88 --> 6011.6
supposedly with names

6010.0 --> 6014.08
of the devil

6011.6 --> 6014.08
satan

6014.8 --> 6021.719
satan's universe the fake one the fake

6018.0 --> 6021.719
imaginary universe

6060.96 --> 6067.719
yeah godzilla yeah when i say such thing

6063.52 --> 6067.719
that's usually sarcasm

6080.8 --> 6084.0
although i think that it is arguable

6083.04 --> 6086.719
that

6084.0 --> 6089.04
we are old little gods

6086.719 --> 6089.92
i think that we're all descendant even

6089.04 --> 6092.719
from

6089.92 --> 6095.119
the original gods

6092.719 --> 6098.8
the ones that were also made by the

6095.119 --> 6098.799999999999
designer big g god

6100.4 --> 6106.4
it just kind of takes away a bit of the

6103.119 --> 6107.759999999999
power of the name right god because if

6106.4 --> 6108.879999999999
you're going to call yourself a little

6107.76 --> 6110.8
god

6108.88 --> 6112.159000000001
well that would be an insult to the big

6110.8 --> 6114.159000000001
god well

6112.159 --> 6115.679
technically i don't even think it's true

6114.159 --> 6118.08
i think it's only true when you

6115.679 --> 6121.6
basically deny the big god and then

6118.08 --> 6125.6
claim to be that claim that the almighty

6121.6 --> 6125.6
designer's authority on yourself

6125.679 --> 6128.679
right

6137.44 --> 6141.678999999999
right so yeah

6139.679 --> 6143.84
the whole problem with calling yourself

6141.679 --> 6146.56
a little g god has always been the

6143.84 --> 6148.96
typical megaloman mania that's always

6146.56 --> 6152.4800000000005
been the problem

6148.96 --> 6152.4800000000005
should go squirting because of it

6157.04 --> 6161.04
but in the end it's just a word

6159.6 --> 6162.96
it really is it's a word with

6161.04 --> 6165.679
implications

6162.96 --> 6167.04
strong meaning and history

6165.679 --> 6171.36
but

6167.04 --> 6174.84
even the whole fear spiraling over that

6171.36 --> 6177.36
really comes from biblical

6174.84 --> 6180.0
fanatics that have already been misled

6177.36 --> 6182.4
through their priestly codes

6180.0 --> 6184.0
and effectively don't have a single clue

6182.4 --> 6187.679
what the [ __ ] they're talking about

6184.0 --> 6187.679
because they're so lost in the code

6188.84 --> 6194.2390000000005
right but yeah in general i don't really

6192.56 --> 6196.159000000001
like it if somebody would call

6194.239 --> 6198.159
themselves a little god

6196.159 --> 6200.879999999999
it would always be like

6198.159 --> 6200.879999999999
don't do that

6201.44 --> 6205.839999999999
like if you're gonna have sensations

6203.44 --> 6209.04
like that then keep it private

6205.84 --> 6209.04
it's not not good

6209.199 --> 6214.4
it draws in like bad situations to do

6212.159 --> 6214.4
that

6215.44 --> 6219.919999999999
because you're gonna have immediately

6217.36 --> 6223.28
pedestal and pit effects and you will

6219.92 --> 6225.6
get the life of brian effect

6223.28 --> 6228.0
and lebron didn't even ask for it

6225.6 --> 6230.719
right and he got that [ __ ]

6228.0 --> 6233.36
so that's why you shouldn't do that

6230.719 --> 6235.44
it's like if you have incredible power

6233.36 --> 6238.08
and you realize it enough that you kind

6235.44 --> 6240.638999999999
of feel like you're a little god well

6238.08 --> 6243.04
then be very careful with that because

6240.639 --> 6244.32
if you're just gonna throw it out there

6243.04 --> 6246.88
well guess what's gonna happen they're

6244.32 --> 6249.36
all gonna like ah give me give me yeah i

6246.88 --> 6249.36
want that

6250.32 --> 6254.0
right

6251.119 --> 6257.119
that's where things go wrong

6254.0 --> 6257.119
that's really the reason

6257.28 --> 6262.5599999999995
right it's not an insult even to god to

6260.32 --> 6265.36
call yourself a little g-god

6262.56 --> 6267.76
it's the consequences that is the

6265.36 --> 6267.759999999999
problem

6275.92 --> 6279.76
it's the effect

6278.239 --> 6281.678999999999
right every time

6279.76 --> 6283.52
even christians say that like oh god is

6281.679 --> 6286.2390000000005
angry over this god is happy over that

6283.52 --> 6287.84
i'm like no no he's not

6286.239 --> 6290.959999999999
that's not what that is that's not what

6287.84 --> 6293.119000000001
sin is it's literally the result

6290.96 --> 6295.6
is what happens

6293.119 --> 6297.36
right sin is revealed by the

6295.6 --> 6298.8
consequences

6297.36 --> 6301.679
on a very

6298.8 --> 6304.2390000000005
spiritual level

6301.679 --> 6308.639
not just physical not just material you

6304.239 --> 6311.199
can't prove sin just through material

6308.639 --> 6312.96
sin wears on the spirit

6311.199 --> 6317.759999999999
it just does it has

6312.96 --> 6320.639
a direct response that is god's judgment

6317.76 --> 6325.04
the effect that sin has

6320.639 --> 6325.04
is the judgment that is the price

6325.28 --> 6330.32
it's not like god is looking at you from

6328.0 --> 6332.88
outside of reality like oh how dare you

6330.32 --> 6334.32
think that how dare you say that no dude

6332.88 --> 6336.0
do you think god doesn't have anything

6334.32 --> 6339.679
better to do with his life

6336.0 --> 6342.96
if he isn't if he is literally alive as

6339.679 --> 6342.96
per our definition even

6343.36 --> 6347.839999999999
like

6344.96 --> 6351.119
it's no point this is all his

6347.84 --> 6353.28
thing this is all part of it

6351.119 --> 6355.199
the instructions are right there

6353.28 --> 6358.0
is that you're there to figure out what

6355.199 --> 6360.719
is sin

6358.0 --> 6363.679
then you live with that knowledge avoid

6360.719 --> 6366.0
sin or take it on you when it's like

6363.679 --> 6367.92
essential like sometimes you can

6366.0 --> 6369.679
actually go it

6367.92 --> 6372.4
sometimes you have to do something bad

6369.679 --> 6376.0
to achieve something good and that is

6372.4 --> 6378.32
just a physical and spiritual reality

6376.0 --> 6380.719
but as long as you recognize that what

6378.32 --> 6383.759999999999
you're doing is bad

6380.719 --> 6386.4
then you may still do it to justify the

6383.76 --> 6389.119000000001
end result which but right but it is a

6386.4 --> 6390.96
sin it will have the price

6389.119 --> 6392.239
right and that's what it's really about

6390.96 --> 6395.44
to me it's like

6392.239 --> 6397.28
know the price

6395.44 --> 6398.879999999999
right sin is sin that doesn't mean as

6397.28 --> 6401.199
soon as you identify the sin that means

6398.88 --> 6403.04
you have to scrap scrub it out of every

6401.199 --> 6405.5199999999995
part of your life that's

6403.04 --> 6407.04
unbelievably tough it'll drive people

6405.52 --> 6409.679
insane sometimes

6407.04 --> 6411.44
what's more important is that you know

6409.679 --> 6412.719
and remember

6411.44 --> 6416.159
what it is

6412.719 --> 6418.32
and then figure out what it does

6416.159 --> 6422.0
because what sin does

6418.32 --> 6422.0
is much more important

6423.119 --> 6428.0
that's the really important part to know

6425.199 --> 6431.5199999999995
that it is really something and that it

6428.0 --> 6433.84
does things to you

6431.52 --> 6436.400000000001
that's part of the design that's why it

6433.84 --> 6439.639
is sin because of the results because of

6436.4 --> 6439.638999999999
the consequences

6442.48 --> 6446.0
right and you can ignore the

6444.4 --> 6448.719
consequences in your mind you can

6446.0 --> 6450.56
believe that it doesn't exist but it

6448.719 --> 6452.8
does exist

6450.56 --> 6454.4800000000005
it will happen it will

6452.8 --> 6456.4800000000005
bypass you

6454.48 --> 6458.718999999999
and you think you bypassed it because

6456.48 --> 6460.5599999999995
you don't think it's real but it's still

6458.719 --> 6462.639
happening and it's still wearing on your

6460.56 --> 6463.84
soul even if it is bypassing your

6462.639 --> 6466.400000000001
consciousness

6463.84 --> 6468.88
the sin is still the sin it will still

6466.4 --> 6471.839999999999
wear on you and even some people that

6468.88 --> 6474.400000000001
have eye for it they will see it they

6471.84 --> 6477.8
will see that you have the sin even if

6474.4 --> 6477.799999999999
you've forgotten

6488.32 --> 6491.32
ugh

6498.4 --> 6503.36
the problem is no

6500.719 --> 6505.36
no that's not really the problem

6503.36 --> 6506.639
the problem is is that people are just

6505.36 --> 6509.679
too willing

6506.639 --> 6511.36
to give everything to the psychopaths

6509.679 --> 6512.8
that's the real problem

6511.36 --> 6514.719
problem is not that there are

6512.8 --> 6517.28
psychopaths and what they do the problem

6514.719 --> 6519.04
is that everybody's effectively okay

6517.28 --> 6522.0
with it they might have a public

6519.04 --> 6524.239
relations opinion oh no i don't like

6522.0 --> 6526.239
them as soon as you explain to them how

6524.239 --> 6527.28
they literally rule you and mind control

6526.239 --> 6529.5199999999995
you

6527.28 --> 6532.639
they'll just want to forget about it and

6529.52 --> 6535.76
thereby consenting that's the real

6532.639 --> 6538.08
the real thing that they do with it

6535.76 --> 6542.0
they're okay with it because they can't

6538.08 --> 6543.76
handle it yeah that's the reality that's

6542.0 --> 6545.52
why they're there

6543.76 --> 6546.8
they're there for a reason they're there

6545.52 --> 6552.400000000001
because people

6546.8 --> 6552.400000000001
are secretly accepting them to be there

6553.52 --> 6558.679
all right i'm gonna take a two minute

6554.88 --> 6558.679
break be right back

6649.92 --> 6652.92
um

6661.199 --> 6664.96
right so yeah guys i hope you're really

6663.28 --> 6667.5199999999995

i am it's been great this is like the

6667.52 --> 6672.080000000001
real first benefit of it cooling down

once i get going it's just bam bam next

6674.88 --> 6678.8
thing next thing next thing bam bam bam

6676.639 --> 6680.96
right without me like

6678.8 --> 6683.599
oh [ __ ] i have to take a five minute

6680.96 --> 6686.4
break again because i'm overeating right

6683.599 --> 6688.2390000000005
oh thank you

6686.4 --> 6691.199
thank you for finally not being so

6688.239 --> 6693.44
freaking hot anymore

6691.199 --> 6696.719
although i will probably miss you but i

6693.44 --> 6696.719
know you'll be back next year

6698.239 --> 6701.04
wait what happened

6701.52 --> 6704.2390000000005
oh god

6704.96 --> 6708.76
yeah it's just a numpty

6709.04 --> 6711.599
good call

6713.28 --> 6718.239
no curvature derpy derp

6716.4 --> 6720.879999999999
all right anyway i really hope you guys

6718.239 --> 6724.48
are appreciating the show

6720.88 --> 6726.4800000000005
have no idea what i'm gonna title this

6724.48 --> 6728.239
this it's been so over the place and

6726.48 --> 6729.678999999999
maybe i'm just gonna skip on the title

6728.239 --> 6731.5199999999995
today

6729.679 --> 6736.32
right but i really do hope unless you

6731.52 --> 6739.119000000001
guys have like the ultimate suggestion

6736.32 --> 6739.119
that would be cool

6739.28 --> 6744.48
right

6740.32 --> 6744.48
but yeah i really hope that also that

6744.639 --> 6749.2390000000005
i will get some donations again

6750.56 --> 6753.52
a little bit help

6754.639 --> 6758.2390000000005
bigger bits help even more

6758.32 --> 6763.599
but yeah it's been a while and

6761.44 --> 6766.799999999999
don't wanna

6763.599 --> 6768.8
like take away all that momentum

6766.8 --> 6771.119000000001
so if i just keep ignoring it then at

6768.8 --> 6772.96
some point i'm just gonna run into like

6771.119 --> 6775.199
like i'm broke

6772.96 --> 6777.36
and i really hate that i hate when that

6775.199 --> 6780.0
happens

6777.36 --> 6783.199
so i could really use

6780.0 --> 6785.84
some support to keep me going

6783.199 --> 6788.239
and to keep me focused on the higher

6785.84 --> 6788.2390000000005
level

6789.84 --> 6796.2390000000005
martin show being proved

6792.88 --> 6798.32
no but regards i don't want to

6796.239 --> 6802.48
that would feel like an attack

6798.32 --> 6807.0
i don't i don't even mean that right

6802.48 --> 6807.0
it's just an analysis and it's

6810.08 --> 6814.159
i mean the thing is

6811.84 --> 6816.400000000001
martin gets it i know that if martin

6814.159 --> 6819.839999999999
watches this that he'll get it

6816.4 --> 6822.4
he'll know like oh it's just being arwin

6819.84 --> 6824.2390000000005
but other people might not get that i

6822.4 --> 6825.92
don't want to give out an impression

6824.239 --> 6828.5599999999995
that i'm like attacking martin litke

6825.92 --> 6828.56
because i'm not

6829.84 --> 6836.56
just jokes oh god freaking jokes

6834.32 --> 6836.5599999999995
oh

6844.48 --> 6847.48
what

6854.32 --> 6857.679
okay charlie

6855.679 --> 6859.1990000000005
i

6857.679 --> 6860.84
i don't know if i've ever heard that

6859.199 --> 6864.4
before gibbous

6860.84 --> 6864.400000000001
um i don't know

6866.96 --> 6870.719
doesn't ring a bell i might have heard

6868.88 --> 6873.36
it like one time before but it doesn't

6870.719 --> 6877.2390000000005
really ring a bell

6873.36 --> 6877.239
i don't know what that is

6883.92 --> 6886.4800000000005
are you saying that there's like a

6885.52 --> 6888.4800000000005
moment

6886.48 --> 6891.119
where the moon

6888.48 --> 6892.959999999999
where there's just like a piece cut off

6891.119 --> 6895.679
that's actually not just shadow but

6892.96 --> 6895.679
transparent

6896.88 --> 6900.400000000001
oh

6897.76 --> 6901.84
anything half full

6900.4 --> 6904.32
too full

6901.84 --> 6906.400000000001
right

6904.32 --> 6909.44
okay

6906.4 --> 6909.44
some phases you know

6909.679 --> 6912.08
apparently

6911.119 --> 6915.04
sort of

6912.08 --> 6918.199
or like a sub category of the moon phase

6915.04 --> 6918.199
i guess

6944.08 --> 6947.08
interesting

6947.76 --> 6953.1990000000005
right so there isn't a shadow bit it's

6950.4 --> 6953.199
just not there

6953.36 --> 6955.839999999999
interesting

6957.36 --> 6962.08
look the moon hologram to me it is all

6959.76 --> 6964.400000000001
it's exactly how i see it it is really

6962.08 --> 6966.96
weird there's so many weird [ __ ]

6964.4 --> 6968.799999999999
weird weird ass things about it

6966.96 --> 6971.52
like how it just

6968.8 --> 6975.1990000000005
never actually goes like below the

6971.52 --> 6977.84
horizon it just hits it and disappears

6975.199 --> 6981.36
that freaking thing and then the

6977.84 --> 6983.28
disappearing for three days entirely

6981.36 --> 6985.598999999999
like what the hell

6983.28 --> 6987.04
this is just another one of these crazy

6985.599 --> 6991.119000000001
little things about the moon like

6987.04 --> 6991.119
everything about the moon is so freaky

6992.239 --> 6997.44
everything about the moon is just crazy

6994.719 --> 6997.44
and freaky

7000.32 --> 7003.44
it's it

7001.44 --> 7005.5199999999995
really when you really stop to think

7003.44 --> 7008.48
about the details it is almost like i'm

7005.52 --> 7010.719
a little freaky monster it's like

7008.48 --> 7012.0
like if you just see it it's like oh

7010.719 --> 7014.159
it's the moon

7012.0 --> 7017.36
if you actually look really carefully

7014.159 --> 7020.239
every time and you just know like

7017.36 --> 7022.719
what is this thing then like well you

7020.239 --> 7026.08
could end up a lunatic because it's just

7022.719 --> 7028.32
like what the [ __ ] is that thing

7026.08 --> 7031.84
well it's definitely not a ball of dirt

7028.32 --> 7031.84
i can tell you that

7043.52 --> 7045.76
hmm

7048.96 --> 7054.4
right well for me the biggest mystery

7051.36 --> 7056.48
has always been with the moon

7054.4 --> 7059.119
besides the typicals

7056.48 --> 7059.919999999999
but sighting sighting-wise is when

7059.119 --> 7062.08
it's

7059.92 --> 7064.32
like almost

7062.08 --> 7068.08
uh

7064.32 --> 7070.5599999999995
almost entirely black right when it's

7068.08 --> 7073.119
like almost

7070.56 --> 7076.96
i'm terrible at moon phases but

7073.119 --> 7079.199
and it's like a really sharp circle

7076.96 --> 7081.679
and then

7079.199 --> 7084.96
like when it it's like

7081.679 --> 7088.159
not entirely perfectly black sky anymore

7084.96 --> 7090.88
right that's when things are like what

7088.159 --> 7093.36
the [ __ ] am i looking at because then it

7090.88 --> 7094.4800000000005
just becomes this weird

7093.36 --> 7095.759999999999
black

7094.48 --> 7099.04
disc

7095.76 --> 7101.52
sort of thing that's so bizarre if you

7099.04 --> 7103.36
really look at that

7101.52 --> 7106.2390000000005
that part i always find so weird is that

7103.36 --> 7109.04
there is like a moon phase where you can

7106.239 --> 7112.08
literally see the shadow side

7109.04 --> 7112.84
and in other moments you don't at all

7112.08 --> 7116.239
it's

7112.84 --> 7118.2390000000005
like [ __ ] is this moon

7116.239 --> 7121.28
it makes no sense

7118.239 --> 7121.28
it's so bizarre

7126.96 --> 7130.4
that's that's a

7128.48 --> 7132.5599999999995
that's a decent

7130.4 --> 7137.5599999999995
fair enough point to

7132.56 --> 7137.56
godzilla it's a decent way to look at it

7145.52 --> 7152.400000000001
yeah yeah of course pgc net yeah yeah

7150.32 --> 7154.4
moonfall was

7152.4 --> 7156.239
good for a laugh yeah it was

7154.4 --> 7158.08
i thought it was a very entertaining

7156.239 --> 7161.04
movie

7158.08 --> 7164.08
silly and entertaining it's just like

7161.04 --> 7166.96
i'm just wondering if like

7164.08 --> 7170.639
did david ike just make a deal because

7166.96 --> 7174.8
this seems like david ike's theory

7170.639 --> 7174.8
the movie this is it really did

7175.04 --> 7182.8
i mean it was like everything in it was

7177.36 --> 7182.799999999999
like perfectly david i compatible it was

7183.28 --> 7188.639
so just the whole thing was just like

7184.88 --> 7188.639
this is david ike the movie

7188.96 --> 7193.679
does he know that they made a movie

7191.199 --> 7193.678999999999
about it

7196.719 --> 7201.76
ah

7199.04 --> 7205.8
but yeah it was it was entertaining

7201.76 --> 7205.8
stupid but entertaining

7212.719 --> 7216.88
moonfall was fourth great gay

7218.639 --> 7223.4400000000005
is nerd it's math gay chao young cat

7223.599 --> 7228.32
it's not universally gay i mean there

7226.0 --> 7229.52
weren't even like gays in there it was

7228.32 --> 7231.84
no gay

7229.52 --> 7233.679
okay so you that's really bad to then

7231.84 --> 7236.639
call a gay when they literally did not

7233.679 --> 7238.4
have gays in a hollywood movie

7236.639 --> 7240.639
of all places

7238.4 --> 7243.28
right so it's more like

7240.639 --> 7245.84
just nerdy it's for like nerdy kids

7243.28 --> 7247.679
they're really into space

7245.84 --> 7252.360000000001
not gay

7247.679 --> 7252.36
although you could say that space is gay

7269.44 --> 7272.799999999999
right

7271.28 --> 7274.4
but what would be an interesting

7272.8 --> 7275.360000000001
exercise

7274.4 --> 7277.839999999999
if you

7275.36 --> 7280.32
are watching moonfall

7277.84 --> 7282.4800000000005
is to just watch that movie

7280.32 --> 7284.08
and then as soon as like the [ __ ] really

7282.48 --> 7286.239
starts hitting the fan and you get these

7284.08 --> 7288.96
scenes of like the moon

7286.239 --> 7292.0
almost scraping past the earth it is

7288.96 --> 7294.4800000000005
like really spectacular cgi i've never

7292.0 --> 7297.84
seen anything like that

7294.48 --> 7299.678999999999
it was really spectacular it was

7297.84 --> 7302.0
but then if you just see it as like oh

7299.679 --> 7304.159
my god just

7302.0 --> 7306.32
put it on pause

7304.159 --> 7307.759999999999
and just walk outside

7306.32 --> 7308.96
and then realize

7307.76 --> 7312.2390000000005
that's

7308.96 --> 7314.96
never ever gonna happen

7312.239 --> 7314.959999999999
thank god

7316.639 --> 7322.2390000000005
yeah i mean the moon may become

7320.08 --> 7324.5599999999995
like blood or something

7322.239 --> 7327.199
but it's never going to be a giant ball

7324.56 --> 7330.719
of dirt that's going to scrape past the

7327.199 --> 7333.04
earth and literally cause [ __ ] to just

7330.719 --> 7335.119
get lifted up and then drop down again

7333.04 --> 7337.199
that's never going to happen so remind

7335.119 --> 7338.96
yourself when you watch that

7337.199 --> 7341.199
turn it on pause

7338.96 --> 7344.96
walk outside and realize

7341.199 --> 7346.08
thank god that's never ever gonna happen

7344.96 --> 7349.8
do it

7346.08 --> 7349.8
it'll be good for you

7352.8 --> 7356.96
cgi was better than nasa's yeah

7356.08 --> 7359.36
it was

7356.96 --> 7361.84
yeah it was amazing it was really

7359.36 --> 7361.839999999999
amazing

7364.48 --> 7369.04
oh ciao young cat you oh that is oh you

7367.52 --> 7371.119000000001
tricked me

7369.04 --> 7373.28
you tricked me

7371.119 --> 7376.4
you used the word gay

7373.28 --> 7376.4
in the boomer way

7378.48 --> 7381.839999999999
fair enough i didn't see that

7386.08 --> 7390.5599999999995
silly embarrassing

7388.0 --> 7394.679
is that how that was used

7390.56 --> 7394.679
but that's how i use it

7395.76 --> 7398.08
huh

7400.159 --> 7405.44
it's so confusing

7402.639 --> 7408.2390000000005
semantically i mean i mean sometimes gay

7405.44 --> 7411.44
is just homosexual sometimes gay is just

7408.239 --> 7411.44
silly and embarrassing

7415.119 --> 7420.239
that's why i also like to use the

7417.679 --> 7423.28
description squirty

7420.239 --> 7426.959999999999
because that is like more narrow down to

7423.28 --> 7426.96
a specific type of mindset

7427.28 --> 7430.96
right

7428.079 --> 7432.639
i mean you could also use gamma

7430.96 --> 7434.88
all of those things are very specific

7432.639 --> 7436.32
the word gay it's in itself is not

7434.88 --> 7439.599
really that specific anymore it's

7436.32 --> 7441.119
basically been weaponized

7439.599 --> 7443.360000000001
it's

7441.119 --> 7446.96
it's yeah

7443.36 --> 7446.96
it has multiple meanings now

7447.76 --> 7451.84
that's right it was stolen correct

7454.159 --> 7457.44
i know

7455.599 --> 7459.360000000001
joey and cat

7457.44 --> 7462.32
and pgcnet

7459.36 --> 7465.5199999999995
yeah gay also just meant like joyous

7462.32 --> 7468.639
like like oh i'm so gay today that just

7465.52 --> 7471.040000000001
means i'm kind of happy

7468.639 --> 7473.04
if they that was it that's it that's

7471.04 --> 7475.36
what it meant

7473.04 --> 7479.32
that's like early 20th century talk

7475.36 --> 7479.32
that's just how people talk

7488.719 --> 7494.52
something queer is going on what the

7491.199 --> 7494.5199999999995
[ __ ] cleary

7506.4 --> 7513.44
yeah i yeah i bet cleary i mean

7510.719 --> 7516.4
yeah queer was also a word

7513.44 --> 7516.4
that was just used

7516.8 --> 7523.04
it's like another word for odd isn't it

7519.92 --> 7523.04
it's just odd

7532.4 --> 7535.4
yep

7555.92 --> 7559.04
anyway i think i'm going to be rounding

7557.44 --> 7560.159
out the show but i was really hoping to

7559.04 --> 7562.719
get

7560.159 --> 7565.598999999999
some paypal donation today any

7562.719 --> 7565.599
any would be great

7569.119 --> 7574.96
i've

7570.48 --> 7578.159
gone for two over two hours almost

7574.96 --> 7578.159
two hours five minutes

7578.48 --> 7583.04
could you screen share if you need yeah

7580.719 --> 7583.04
yeah

7584.96 --> 7590.719
don't know anything about stream

7586.719 --> 7593.199
i'm just using obs and youtube

7590.719 --> 7597.0
i got it pretty simple but i can't

7593.199 --> 7597.0
present any image

7626.079 --> 7629.679
obs seems to be the standard for life

7627.76 --> 7632.320000000001
yeah because it really is really good

7629.679 --> 7634.4800000000005
but there's other systems too gortilla

7632.32 --> 7638.32
there's other systems

7634.48 --> 7638.32
there's like stream yard and

7639.119 --> 7643.36
that's the only one i can think of on

7640.88 --> 7645.679
the top of my head there's others like

7643.36 --> 7650.0
that just things yeah google plus

7645.679 --> 7650.0
basically is also a system now oh no

7653.52 --> 7658.159000000001
it's different

7655.679 --> 7660.159
the thing is obs is just like a sub

7658.159 --> 7662.719
program i mean there is like just

7660.159 --> 7664.879999999999
websites you go there like google plus

7662.719 --> 7667.36
and you just do it and you can then like

7664.88 --> 7670.159000000001
a live stream it relay it to a youtube

7667.36 --> 7671.92
channel but it's just gonna be talking

7670.159 --> 7674.239
heads

7671.92 --> 7676.639
screens and you could potentially screen

7674.239 --> 7679.36
share something in there well obs is

7676.639 --> 7681.599
just gives you much more dynamic control

7679.36 --> 7683.04
over what's going to be on your screen

7681.599 --> 7685.04
that's how i'm able to get this

7683.04 --> 7687.04
background picture and everything going

7685.04 --> 7690.0
and

7687.04 --> 7691.599
but you don't necessarily need it to do

7690.0 --> 7693.199
live streaming though

7691.599 --> 7696.76
but it can

7693.199 --> 7696.759999999999
be of assistance

7724.4 --> 7730.48
hey drunkenbullet411

7727.599 --> 7733.04
good to see you a little late hope

7730.48 --> 7735.678999999999
you're doing okay

7733.04 --> 7738.92
it must be like really late now in

7735.679 --> 7738.92
in australia

7746.56 --> 7751.119000000001
oh bro did you just say hello just to

7749.199 --> 7753.919999999999

7751.119 --> 7755.598999999999
you are the best man

7753.92 --> 7759.639
i really needed that

7755.599 --> 7759.639
thank you so much drunken bullet

7782.079 --> 7787.04
by the way my subscribers are also just

7784.88 --> 7788.56
kind of slowly

7787.04 --> 7791.199
growing still

7788.56 --> 7795.159000000001
i mean not for long and i might actually

7791.199 --> 7795.159
hit the 2500.

7803.599 --> 7807.96
i'm currently at 2465.

7810.4 --> 7815.759999999999
and it's always like kind of like

7812.96 --> 7817.84
hanging there but it is just like really

7815.76 --> 7821.360000000001
slowly trickling in

7817.84 --> 7821.360000000001
for the last few months so

7822.639 --> 7826.88
but yeah it's not

7824.079 --> 7828.719
they they haven't like really cut frozen

7826.88 --> 7830.8
it off like they did what is it now two

7828.719 --> 7832.079
years ago they did that for quite a long

7830.8 --> 7834.2390000000005
time

7832.079 --> 7837.44
it just was it was so capped like you

7834.239 --> 7840.839999999999
couldn't get above that number

7837.44 --> 7843.919999999999
like what is it for like several months

7840.84 --> 7844.96
straight uh paypal link in description

7843.92 --> 7848.159
yes

7844.96 --> 7850.4
wait there's no people yeah there is

7848.159 --> 7852.719
it's not clickable

7850.4 --> 7852.719
uh

7853.199 --> 7856.199
no

7858.639 --> 7861.36
i guess not

7864.96 --> 7869.92
well you could use the paypal me you

7867.28 --> 7871.84
just copy that if you just copy and then

7869.92 --> 7875.1990000000005
paste that into

7871.84 --> 7875.1990000000005
a browser that should work

7876.56 --> 7881.4800000000005
testing it right now yeah it works great

7892.56 --> 7896.56
but it didn't ether live stream lessons

7894.719 --> 7899.28
yeah so i heard i haven't watched it but

7896.56 --> 7901.52
i know he's on that now

7899.28 --> 7905.5199999999995
so there is like a challenge now between

7901.52 --> 7907.360000000001
whitsid and the flat earth debates

7905.52 --> 7909.040000000001
he's gone at it

7907.36 --> 7912.159
at the same time there's also a

7909.04 --> 7914.639
religious conflict it seems between jim

7912.159 --> 7918.079
bob and jaren

7914.639 --> 7918.079
also so yeah

7919.36 --> 7923.5199999999995
maybe it's just the end of summer

7922.0 --> 7926.0
maybe that always happens i don't

7923.52 --> 7929.040000000001
remember exactly

7926.0 --> 7929.04
but i'm not surprised

7930.639 --> 7934.719
like the sun the extreme heat is dying

7932.96 --> 7936.8
down and people are then just kind of

7934.719 --> 7938.32
looking for a challenge so that it's

7936.8 --> 7941.4800000000005
only logical that something like that

7938.32 --> 7941.48
would happen

7942.0 --> 7945.76
maybe i'm just overthinking it

7947.36 --> 7950.0
f gerund

7950.159 --> 7955.36
fair enough gorzilla

7952.0 --> 7957.36
i'm not blaming you i mean i get some of

7955.36 --> 7960.4
his points but it seems like he's just

7957.36 --> 7962.799999999999
being overly sentimental about

7960.4 --> 7963.5599999999995
it just seems sometimes like jiren lets

7962.8 --> 7968.8
his

7963.56 --> 7971.1990000000005
sentimentality dictate to him who god is

7968.8 --> 7974.400000000001
and that part seems like a

7971.199 --> 7977.119
persistent mistake like that is his

7974.4 --> 7979.199
mistake that he is making

7977.119 --> 7982.0
and that does make him pompous you are

7979.199 --> 7984.48
correct that makes him pompous right

7982.0 --> 7985.599
because of the sentimentality

7984.48 --> 7988.799999999999
effect

7985.599 --> 7992.079
he's letting his feelings dictate

7988.8 --> 7994.2390000000005
things about philosophy

7992.079 --> 7996.719
and that's just a mistake it is a

7994.239 --> 7998.718999999999
mistake and it doesn't matter how good

7996.719 --> 8000.56
you get it how long you do it will

7998.719 --> 8002.32
always be a mistake

8000.56 --> 8003.84
because it will not make you understand

8002.32 --> 8007.639
god you will never get to an

8003.84 --> 8007.639
understanding that way

8012.88 --> 8017.679
but that's

8014.8 --> 8017.679
karen doesn't understand

8019.199 --> 8023.678999999999
i wouldn't go that far i mean he does

8021.679 --> 8024.8
have some rudimentary understanding it's

8023.679 --> 8027.1990000000005
just that

8024.8 --> 8029.1990000000005
his focus man he's just

8027.199 --> 8031.36
he's not focusing in the right way he's

8029.199 --> 8034.159
not approaching it the right way

8031.36 --> 8035.839999999999
but it's it's probably a phase i don't

8034.159 --> 8038.799999999999
know man i don't want to get involved i

8035.84 --> 8041.28
don't want to poke him in with that

8038.8 --> 8043.360000000001
i mean i do kind of like to hear him out

8041.28 --> 8045.599
sometimes about it he does make

8043.36 --> 8047.839999999999
interesting points it's just that

8045.599 --> 8050.0
overall it seems like he's letting his

8047.84 --> 8052.8
sentimentality

8050.0 --> 8053.92
dictate to him who god is and that is a

8052.8 --> 8056.88
mistake

8053.92 --> 8060.639
that is universally a mistake

8056.88 --> 8063.24
that's not the way to do that

8060.639 --> 8064.88

[Music]

8064.88 --> 8069.92
like posh and all the other

8067.36 --> 8071.839999999999
orthodox guys aren't exactly perfect

8069.92 --> 8073.679
either so

8071.84 --> 8075.29
neither of them are perfect and so it's

8073.679 --> 8077.1990000000005
just gonna be like

8075.29 --> 8078.639
[Music]

8082.8 --> 8088.0
jim bob is a very calm sensible person

8085.84 --> 8090.2390000000005
as we've all seen

8088.0 --> 8092.32
so

8090.239 --> 8094.159
but he might poke jaren a little more he

8092.32 --> 8095.5199999999995
does kind of deserve to be poked over

8094.159 --> 8097.598999999999
this

8095.52 --> 8099.92
i mean jaren is literally doing it and

8097.599 --> 8103.8
he's kind of gushingly doing it so yeah

8099.92 --> 8103.8

8115.92 --> 8119.4400000000005
sentimentality right

8119.92 --> 8125.04

by fear

8127.52 --> 8130.56

8128.8 --> 8132.88
fear of

not enough good

8134.56 --> 8139.92
