[Music]

35.29 --> 43.82
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.01 --> 50.32
early-bird number 99 I'm your host

43.82 --> 53.39
Arwen and yeah thus I got an intro but

50.32 --> 55.730000000000004
it's a bit confusing though I wasn't

53.39 --> 57.59
actually sure if there's it was gonna be

55.73 --> 60.44
sound playing because every time I play

57.59 --> 62.809000000000005
it in OBS I don't hear anything so I

60.44 --> 65.75
actually unmute the YouTube page to

62.809 --> 70.53999999999999
check if there was actual sound with it

65.75 --> 74.45
but that seemed to be the case so yeah

70.54 --> 79.159
it's very nice and yeah there is a

74.45 --> 83.06
special intro type function within OBS

79.159 --> 85.61
it makes it really easy to just turn on

83.06 --> 90.61
the intro and as soon as you transition

85.61 --> 90.61
it it starts playing pretty cool

92.29 --> 100.66000000000001
today seems to be very very very much

95.9 --> 100.66000000000001
like yesterday very sunny and nice

100.9 --> 109.84
a total nightmare of chemtrails and I'm

106.84 --> 118.69
really pissed off at this very much

109.84 --> 121.84
pissed off don't want this crap so who

118.69 --> 125.73
is doing this they're ruining a

121.84 --> 125.73
perfectly nice Sunday

128.42 --> 133.22
yeah even though I have absolutely no

130.64 --> 136.97
confirmation that there is actual

133.22 --> 138.319
poisoning of some kind going on it just

136.97 --> 141.65
ruins everything

138.319 --> 149.66
it ruins the clearness of the day it

141.65 --> 156.92000000000002
ruins my mood and I think it's ugly so

149.66 --> 164.6
unless you know if there was actually

156.92 --> 166.76
some kind of official report like yeah

164.6 --> 168.65
we are geoengineering and well they

166.76 --> 174.29
already admitted that they are that

168.65 --> 178.19
doing you boo tests supposedly then they

174.29 --> 180.65
should be saying live time exactly what

178.19 --> 187.43
they're doing and why what the reasoning

180.65 --> 189.67000000000002
behind it is so yeah it's not like we

187.43 --> 194.78
were in control we're doing all this

189.67 --> 198.23
even inserting rumors and [ __ ] but how

194.78 --> 201.32
terrible it could be it's just why don't

198.23 --> 203.39
you just say what you're doing and why

201.32 --> 206.57
by it's so important to start spraying

203.39 --> 209.11999999999998
now and ruin a perfectly nice day what's

206.57 --> 213.25
the terrible thing that you're trying to

209.12 --> 213.25
reveal it doesn't make any sense to me

217.45 --> 221.39999999999998
are they afraid of global warming

223.47 --> 232.42
seriously what global freakin warming

228.54 --> 236.44
there's it's the opposite if anything

232.42 --> 239.29
there is like in me and the late

236.44 --> 241.69
Renaissance there is a new period of

239.29 --> 246.519
cooling and miniaturization this has

241.69 --> 248.98
been reflected upon forever even by the

246.519 --> 252.489
sub mainstream by the altern the

248.98 --> 257.829
standard alternative narratives quite

252.489 --> 264.13
out in the open so it's ridiculous just

257.829 --> 270.669
let it be and please bring out the co2 I

264.13 --> 275.229
mean it like don't overdo it but a if

270.669 --> 277.87
you're gonna use stuff then take

275.229 --> 280.06
everything else out except the co2

277.87 --> 285.61
because that's actually really useful

280.06 --> 288.12
and yeah you could even channel it

285.61 --> 292.03000000000003
better in the sense that okay

288.12 --> 295.69
co2 where is it best it's best where

292.03 --> 297.88
plants are so yeah you could potentially

295.69 --> 300.7
have like power plants or whatever that

297.88 --> 303.52
it do produce year to and then funnel

300.7 --> 307.27
that co2 unnecessary yeah you could

303.52 --> 312.76
store it in tanks or whatever or just

307.27 --> 316.0
have pipes that just run into forest

312.76 --> 320.979
areas or directly applied to agriculture

316.0 --> 323.2
and use it you're so afraid that the co2

320.979 --> 325.65999999999997
will escape into the atmosphere and do

323.2 --> 328.45
all this terrible damage supposedly

325.66 --> 330.07000000000005
which is ridiculous it's not it's not

328.45 --> 330.78999999999996
even gonna escape in the atmosphere

330.07 --> 334.33
really

330.79 --> 339.28000000000003
co2 is very heavy it's a heavy gas it

334.33 --> 341.02
will naturally sink down and yeah close

339.28 --> 349.32
to the ground close to the plants that's

341.02 --> 353.5
why it works but yeah I'm Oh God

349.32 --> 362.92
this entire climate debate [ __ ] it is so

353.5 --> 367.18
annoying you know when I was approaching

362.92 --> 371.91
my 82 and working in dark and trying to

367.18 --> 375.61
give out this advice stop the ridiculous

371.91 --> 378.64000000000004
Marxism social D railing [ __ ] and

375.61 --> 381.19
focus on nature this is not what I meant

378.64 --> 384.7
it is exactly the opposite it is

381.19 --> 389.11
everything but this freakin co2 Green

384.7 --> 391.18
Deal [ __ ] and that's the Green Deal

389.11 --> 393.28000000000003
is the American thing but yeah Europe

391.18 --> 397.74
and the Netherlands is dealing with the

393.28 --> 401.53
same [ __ ] and it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ]

397.74 --> 405.46000000000004
it's total reverse reality escapism

401.53 --> 407.79999999999995
[ __ ] it's a lie it's a total lie

405.46 --> 412.53999999999996
these people that propel this should be

407.8 --> 415.72
punished punished because they're not

412.54 --> 418.86
doing environmentalism they're doing the

415.72 --> 422.49
exact opposite they're promoting

418.86 --> 424.75
extermination total irrational implosion

422.49 --> 427.48
extermination and it's raloo de chrous

424.75 --> 431.05
these people should not even be sitting

427.48 --> 435.24
there being parts of politics and all

431.05 --> 439.42
this [ __ ] get to some real

435.24 --> 444.18
environmentalism and stop the co2 panic

439.42 --> 444.18
bull [ __ ] I'm sick of it

447.91 --> 452.88000000000005
I wish I could punish them I'm just

472.819 --> 480.41900000000004
but the thing is that with this inversed

478.02 --> 484.56
reality position that what they are

480.419 --> 488.00899999999996
doing because of it and because they're

484.56 --> 489.24
faking their stance it's a lie it's

488.009 --> 491.66900000000004
total lie

489.24 --> 494.25
they might not consciously know it but

491.669 --> 499.53
they probably do because nobody is that

494.25 --> 502.62
[ __ ] even a literal [ __ ] would

499.53 --> 504.65999999999997
know better the only problem is is that

502.62 --> 506.31
yeah they might not be intelligent

504.66 --> 510.59900000000005
enough to lie about it

506.31 --> 512.75
that evil because total lie evil does

510.599 --> 519.3199999999999
require a certain level of intelligence

512.75 --> 521.31
but because they do this the actual real

519.32 --> 521.969
environmentalism and the importance

521.31 --> 527.67
about it

521.969 --> 531.0
it is vacant nobody is doing it because

527.67 --> 533.8499999999999
they're just focusing on [ __ ] people

531.0 --> 537.149
up and destroying everything

533.85 --> 538.95
well the opposition is just trying to

537.149 --> 543.39
prevent that from happening and who is

538.95 --> 549.6
actually taking care of trying to

543.39 --> 552.87
progress a sensible future for both

549.6 --> 555.69
humans and environment who is actually

552.87 --> 559.5
doing that now nobody because they're

555.69 --> 563.1600000000001
all focusing on these insane maniacs

559.5 --> 566.93
that have borrowed themselves in and are

563.16 --> 571.41
upholding an illusion of being part of

566.93 --> 573.18
an opposition of some kind well a sense

571.41 --> 575.8199999999999
of opposition which they obviously are

573.18 --> 578.2099999999999
not and it's so

575.82 --> 578.21
waiting

593.7 --> 598.6800000000001
yeah and and yeah of course then there

596.13 --> 603.51
is the standard taxing everything to

598.68 --> 612.54
death the tax slavery system is it is

603.51 --> 614.88
part of the strategies but the whole

612.54 --> 618.1999999999999
point of it really is whether they

614.88 --> 623.52
consciously know it or not these people

618.2 --> 626.97
are being driven forth are being part of

623.52 --> 630.93
a system that does want only one thing

626.97 --> 635.4
and that is to end all life to destroy

630.93 --> 637.1099999999999
it all preferably forever and that is

635.4 --> 642.24
what they're doing whether they

637.11 --> 646.67
consciously know it or not it makes no

642.24 --> 650.39
sense it makes no sense they exist and

646.67 --> 650.39
they shouldn't I

651.67 --> 655.02
I wanted him gone

658.75 --> 670.569
maybe that is kind of the the painful

665.35 --> 674.9490000000001
thing they're trying to force on the the

670.569 --> 680.91
new right than the new more sensible

674.949 --> 685.149
human conservative holistic right

680.91 --> 688.99
they're just trying to force all of that

685.149 --> 694.439
to break with civilization just

688.99 --> 697.3290000000001
aggravate you until there is no more

694.439 --> 700.75
maneuverability and you just have no

697.329 --> 702.67
more choice but to savagely murder them

700.75 --> 705.279
all is that really what they're trying

702.67 --> 707.889
to do it's like how it feels to me it's

705.279 --> 710.05
why I got my outbursts is that what

707.889 --> 714.25
they're doing is that the spirit they're

710.05 --> 717.899
just trying to break the permanent

714.25 --> 720.25
balance that have seemed to come up

717.899 --> 724.0
philosophically from the other side the

720.25 --> 726.37
methodology and it just do anything they

724.0 --> 729.879
can this spirit whatever is behind these

726.37 --> 733.29
people is just trying to break it they

729.879 --> 735.4300000000001
just want it to break no matter what and

733.29 --> 739.7199999999999
sometimes I feel that they would

735.43 --> 743.7399999999999
actually commit ritual suicide or

739.72 --> 750.129
whatever just to to get that to happen

743.74 --> 751.86
they would maybe go that far it is total

750.129 --> 754.66
madness

751.86 --> 758.25
it is beyond madness it is beyond

754.66 --> 758.25
humanity it is just

761.95 --> 770.11
maybe it is literally the devil Lucifer

766.26 --> 774.85
being driven in the corner and literally

770.11 --> 779.41
just being put under pressure so hard by

774.85 --> 782.41
basically God himself just damping it in

779.41 --> 785.98
the corner and squishing it like into a

782.41 --> 789.49
black hole to implode and that is why it

785.98 --> 794.44
is so vivid and insane because it is

789.49 --> 798.72
like a final death grasp this somehow

794.44 --> 802.0
stop it maybe that is what it is and

798.72 --> 804.19
yeah as the ozone a death grasp like

802.0 --> 806.62
that like the devil they always try to

804.19 --> 808.72
do it from the inside I always try to go

806.62 --> 812.38
around the corner as I said balance

808.72 --> 815.23
between light and dark always does be

812.38 --> 818.139
most illogical the most aggravating the

815.23 --> 820.99
most maniacal thing the more pressure

818.139 --> 824.82
they receive the more they will follow

820.99 --> 824.82
this these principles

833.57 --> 839.9300000000001
and I am sick of it I'm just so sick of

837.779 --> 839.93
it

841.91 --> 850.76
another one just can we just move on you

844.94 --> 852.98
know being in a society with a lot of

850.76 --> 857.2
people with a lot of different opinions

852.98 --> 860.96
and flaws naturally within all humans

857.2 --> 863.09
consciousness flaws problems and then

860.96 --> 867.14
having a good methodology to try and

863.09 --> 870.5600000000001
balance it all it is already a colossus

867.14 --> 875.54
task just to do that without these

870.56 --> 877.79
freaking maniacs these ultimate insane

875.54 --> 879.5899999999999
destroyers trying to get in the way of

877.79 --> 883.6899999999999
that and ruining as much as possible

879.59 --> 883.69
it's already tough enough alike it is

891.06 --> 898.4699999999999
yeah that's what you get oh you know

894.71 --> 900.12
it's just turn turn on some television

898.47 --> 905.4300000000001
program you know it's just like Oh

900.12 --> 908.37
something random well yeah something

905.43 --> 912.12
random is always gonna be right back on

908.37 --> 915.47
the main target because I cannot not see

912.12 --> 918.09
it I just can't not see it anymore

915.47 --> 920.5500000000001
everywhere I look as I said the

918.09 --> 926.3000000000001
synchronicities are going totally

920.55 --> 926.3
maniacal sometimes into the surreal but

927.11 --> 938.16
even if not into the surreal just you

933.57 --> 940.5
can't not see it anymore and it's also

938.16 --> 942.75
made of theme is flatter it's like once

940.5 --> 944.7
you really figure that out that there

942.75 --> 947.16
are such a big lie going on you can't

944.7 --> 949.95
unsee it anymore and you start to see

947.16 --> 953.0699999999999
the lies unravel in front of you because

949.95 --> 956.4000000000001
there is a a hole there and it's

953.07 --> 958.44
unraveling and you can't knit it back

956.4 --> 960.18
together really the hole is just gonna

958.44 --> 963.24
be unraveling to your consciousness

960.18 --> 966.65
further and further oh by the way thank

963.24 --> 971.99
you daniel field for the super chat five

966.65 --> 971.99
five pounds very much appreciated and

974.21 --> 979.9000000000001

999.37 --> 1008.07
immediately pops to the top of this chat

1005.54 --> 1015.18
anyway yeah much appreciated thanks for

1008.07 --> 1019.6700000000001
the superjet so yeah bringing in some

1015.18 --> 1019.67
heavy stuff again I can't help it

1022.11 --> 1030.72
I am feeling really good by the way it's

1025.069 --> 1034.5
like my back's almost entirely healed

1030.72 --> 1039.03
it's just only a little little stiff

1034.5 --> 1041.91
anymore and yeah I feel bouncy feel full

1039.03 --> 1043.74
of energy I am trying to stay away from

1041.91 --> 1045.72
cannabis as much as possible because

1043.74 --> 1050.49
that still seems to bring in these

1045.72 --> 1054.679
annoying effects that are just not good

1050.49 --> 1058.05
for me it seems at this time it is and

1054.679 --> 1061.26
yea though I can technically compensate

1058.05 --> 1063.12
those effects with alcohol it's not

1061.26 --> 1066.179
something I want to be doing constantly

1063.12 --> 1070.07
because yeah I have been a lot of red

1066.179 --> 1075.0590000000002
wine not quantity wise but just

1070.07 --> 1077.3899999999999
regularly daily you could say and I know

1075.059 --> 1084.44
it's not good I don't want to do that

1077.39 --> 1088.74
but I needed it and I'm feeling that I'm

1084.44 --> 1090.72
noticing a degeneration process going on

1088.74 --> 1094.14
like my body is having more trouble

1090.72 --> 1097.02
recovering in general and I want to stop

1094.14 --> 1099.8600000000001
it and I am gonna stop it especially now

1097.02 --> 1099.86
that I feel a lot better

1100.46 --> 1111.3600000000001
you didn't overcome this is Valley yeah

1107.72 --> 1114.0
so yeah I'm just gonna be trying to

1111.36 --> 1117.9299999999998
mostly just smoke a little tobacco in

1114.0 --> 1120.3
there eat some more because that seems

1117.93 --> 1123.14
to be doing a lot better that that was

1120.3 --> 1125.96
weird by the way that in the deep

1123.14 --> 1129.8100000000002
depression period let's just call it

1125.96 --> 1132.57
food just didn't fall that well even if

1129.81 --> 1138.21
it was made with appreciation and

1132.57 --> 1141.51
everything it just felt like it didn't

1138.21 --> 1143.22
want to be there it's such an odd

1141.51 --> 1144.99
sensation like yeah your body is

1143.22 --> 1147.33
resisting the food even though it is

1144.99 --> 1151.38
nutritious like it's like thanks them

1147.33 --> 1154.05
note just don't do it you don't want to

1151.38 --> 1157.71
nourish it was odd and not healthy not

1154.05 --> 1159.9199999999998
good and I did eat barely for a couple

1157.71 --> 1164.73
of days and though that was a relief

1159.92 --> 1167.0900000000001
it's just not very healthy to do it out

1164.73 --> 1167.09
of nowhere

1168.54 --> 1174.57
but that seems to have switched and now

1172.38 --> 1177.5400000000002
the food seems to be very much

1174.57 --> 1179.9399999999998
appreciated and I'm eating more and I'm

1177.54 --> 1184.71
feeling the immediate results of it like

1179.94 --> 1188.7
getting ready for spring ready for some

1184.71 --> 1191.91
serious physical workouts or while

1188.7 --> 1196.01
serious at least some and good enough

1191.91 --> 1201.63
and yeah and then showing off to it

1196.01 --> 1206.81
socially interacting and just see I'm

1201.63 --> 1206.8100000000002
ready for you what ever since

1217.77 --> 1221.179
so that's chat for a bit

1224.08 --> 1234.559
I'm here Constance and your fields -

1232.399 --> 1239.2389999999998
Jeffrey bill John Watson Karen be over

1234.559 --> 1245.029
buckle Voynich sidekicks

1239.239 --> 1247.339
psyche six the warrior yeah good to see

1245.029 --> 1250.099
you all oh by the way thank you Karen B

1247.339 --> 1253.509
for volunteering to help me out with my

1250.099 --> 1255.71
intro and doing the texts goody hooray

1253.509 --> 1259.6390000000001
that will be awesome if you can do

1255.71 --> 1263.719
something with it because it's not I

1259.639 --> 1266.599
tried a little but the program that I

1263.719 --> 1269.45
use for it didn't didn't even have the

1266.599 --> 1271.779
option so that's not that what that was

1269.45 --> 1271.779
a dead end

1272.139 --> 1278.059
also yeah I was a little disappointed

1274.989 --> 1280.609
because I have been trying the audio

1278.059 --> 1282.349
banana thing and following the

1280.609 --> 1284.21
instruction video the ultimate

1282.349 --> 1286.849
instruction video that Nathan

1284.21 --> 1289.82
recommended me and tried to follow the

1286.849 --> 1292.4289999999999
steps install it and worked out and then

1289.82 --> 1295.1899999999998
it said oh yeah and then go to the

1292.429 --> 1298.22
corner of your screen and click there

1295.19 --> 1299.529
and this audio options and it's like

1298.22 --> 1304.219
[Music]

1299.529 --> 1306.799
it's not there why is it not there is

1304.219 --> 1308.8690000000001
nothing try to go through all the sound

1306.799 --> 1312.649
menus just know there is just it's not

1308.869 --> 1316.009
there nothing about that is there so how

1312.649 --> 1318.799
the hell how do I do these things if

1316.009 --> 1324.969
it's not there even though I did install

1318.799 --> 1324.969
all this stuff doesn't make any sense so

1326.52 --> 1335.84
that's quite frustrating again so I am

1330.48 --> 1339.45
definitely gonna need some slightly more

1335.84 --> 1341.61
evolved expertise on that than just

1339.45 --> 1345.6000000000001
watching that video because yeah it

1341.61 --> 1347.6699999999998
didn't work out halfway the instructions

1345.6 --> 1351.03
it told me to do things that were not

1347.67 --> 1354.15
possible to do they're not really what

1351.03 --> 1356.22
to do about that especially if it

1354.15 --> 1358.17
doesn't give any hints like oh yeah if

1356.22 --> 1360.24
this is not there it might be this or

1358.17 --> 1363.0
that no it's just up through there go

1360.24 --> 1367.04
that do that and that's it move on and

1363.0 --> 1371.91
nothing just couldn't do it

1367.04 --> 1374.04
goody so yeah the whole sound system

1371.91 --> 1378.53
thing it's not gonna be over just yet

1374.04 --> 1378.53
I'm gonna need some help on that too

1381.41 --> 1387.53
but yeah at least the intro is getting

1384.11 --> 1389.57
here and I like it I like I like what

1387.53 --> 1393.02
Chris Barrie made it's very short very

1389.57 --> 1397.539
simple and I like the idea that I had

1393.02 --> 1402.7
with it just Birds and it's funny how

1397.539 --> 1406.7
yeah by accident but creative accident

1402.7 --> 1410.1200000000001
that yeah how the birds just peed at

1406.7 --> 1412.07
their times and kind of synchronized

1410.12 --> 1415.4289999999999
with the music it's just I like it I

1412.07 --> 1419.47
really like what that became so it's

1415.429 --> 1419.47
nice I'm happy about that

1454.75 --> 1467.96
Bertie's death not really dance but I do

1462.11 --> 1470.4399999999998
notice there's like a culture of birds

1467.96 --> 1475.9
here outside they're not currently there

1470.44 --> 1478.6100000000001
but yeah they know I'm here

1475.9 --> 1481.3000000000002
that's so funny like even when

1478.61 --> 1485.6299999999999
everything is closed off they know I

1481.3 --> 1488.1499999999999
just catch them fooling around and

1485.63 --> 1489.2900000000002
sometimes like looking around the corner

1488.15 --> 1492.02
like is he there

1489.29 --> 1495.1399999999999
easy there is he gonna do something is

1492.02 --> 1498.94
he gonna bring out Brett and I could

1495.14 --> 1502.46
just see them looking specifically for

1498.94 --> 1505.16
ya me sitting here and it's just funny

1502.46 --> 1508.0900000000001
that they really have a

1505.16 --> 1508.0900000000001
conceptualization

1510.04 --> 1516.8799999999999
that they know there's a person here

1513.52 --> 1520.36
it's not just a random moving thing for

1516.88 --> 1522.25
them if they feel I am an entity similar

1520.36 --> 1527.1699999999998
to them anyway and that there is a

1522.25 --> 1530.38
social relation that I do it because I

1527.17 --> 1535.2
want to and I know they appreciate it

1530.38 --> 1535.2
and they like that it's so fascinating

1535.23 --> 1539.29
yeah they don't really dance for me but

1537.61 --> 1542.8
they do have a lot of fun here and there

1539.29 --> 1545.94
and squabbling and to them that is fun

1542.8 --> 1550.3
like squabbling to many of these birds

1545.94 --> 1552.1000000000001
is like when you're really young and you

1550.3 --> 1556.03
have brothers and sisters and you just

1552.1 --> 1559.09
start fooling around and like talk doing

1556.03 --> 1561.8799999999999
tug of war and and annoying the [ __ ] out

1559.09 --> 1564.1
of each other on purpose that it really

1561.88 --> 1566.65
is fun and that's what birds do that

1564.1 --> 1572.11
with each other as well and yeah they

1566.65 --> 1574.3300000000002
enjoy doing that oh yeah sometimes it

1572.11 --> 1576.8799999999999
can get really territorial and then can

1574.33 --> 1579.61
move beyond fun then becomes kind of

1576.88 --> 1584.8600000000001
violent but mostly now it's mostly just

1579.61 --> 1588.1799999999998
families just fooling around especially

1584.86 --> 1593.32
like when it's a big and obvious dad

1588.18 --> 1596.8600000000001
with two younger kids or teens that are

1593.32 --> 1599.53
still being very childish and then the

1596.86 --> 1601.75
dad getting annoyed by it like yeah

1599.53 --> 1604.48
you're almost as babies me why are you

1601.75 --> 1610.96
still acting like you're a chick little

1604.48 --> 1613.72
chick so funny how that works yeah Mac

1610.96 --> 1616.3600000000001
but it's mostly Mac wiser I see a lot of

1613.72 --> 1617.89
social activity with the Magpies and

1616.36 --> 1622.35
there's also some crows here and there

1617.89 --> 1626.4
but they they're not that sociable

1622.35 --> 1626.3999999999999
they're much more careful

1641.19 --> 1648.3300000000002
oh yeah hey conspiracy guests know that

1644.19 --> 1650.8490000000002
you're there when are you gonna actually

1648.33 --> 1657.4499999999998
bring out some proof that you really are

1650.849 --> 1660.899
a teacher and and please no mathematical

1657.45 --> 1664.739
proof or some drawing I'd like to have

1660.899 --> 1668.07
some actual physical social proof that

1664.739 --> 1672.739
you really are a teacher because I think

1668.07 --> 1677.269
that you're a sad lying fantasies really

1672.739 --> 1677.269
any pretender and

1678.4 --> 1683.669
[Music]

1683.669 --> 1693.8090000000002

1699.589 --> 1707.549

1705.659 --> 1710.219
the world the truth you owe the world

1707.549 --> 1722.519

are yeah I am calling you out you're a

1722.519 --> 1728.549
liar

1724.07 --> 1733.049
you're a filthy disgusting pretender

1728.549 --> 1735.119
liar that abused fake authority to try

1733.049 --> 1739.459
to mind-control people into believing

1735.119 --> 1745.9189999999999
your [ __ ] your balls [ __ ] and it is

1739.459 --> 1749.579
repulsive it is quite repulsive that

1745.919 --> 1752.5790000000002
you're just out without any shame just

1749.579 --> 1756.209
so you know I'm not gonna prove it I'm

1752.579 --> 1760.259
just gonna be arrogant liar B I don't

1756.209 --> 1764.0990000000002
have to do anything because I know I'm a

1760.259 --> 1768.059
liar right you know you are because

1764.099 --> 1771.589
otherwise yeah why not why not just do

1768.059 --> 1771.589
you do it should be too hard

1775.46 --> 1783.06
- ducks yourself Oh seriously like who

1779.73 --> 1787.59
gives a [ __ ] about your freaking address

1783.06 --> 1789.75
why would you not DOX yourself

1787.59 --> 1793.11
it's not even doxxing you know we have

1789.75 --> 1796.2
seen your face okay we've seen your face

1793.11 --> 1799.35
you already doxxed yourself once you get

1796.2 --> 1803.5800000000002
to show your face you are doxed whether

1799.35 --> 1806.4599999999998
you like to believe it or not but I'd

1803.58 --> 1809.28
like to just see some proof that you're

1806.46 --> 1812.8500000000001
actually a teacher and not just a filthy

1809.28 --> 1815.58
lying scumbag and a [ __ ]

1812.85 --> 1818.1899999999998
that is pretending they are some kind of

1815.58 --> 1825.99
intellectual Authority under a false

1818.19 --> 1828.6200000000001
premise because it just makes me really

1825.99 --> 1828.6200000000001
hate you

1830.92 --> 1839.23
are not even hate it's despise it

1835.9 --> 1843.5500000000002
implies some kind of deeper connection

1839.23 --> 1847.09
there's nothing there now look I don't

1843.55 --> 1849.73
care who is paying for you I don't care

1847.09 --> 1852.25
about whatever theories you're gonna

1849.73 --> 1855.91
[ __ ] out and try to distract everyone

1852.25 --> 1859.06
with some kind of maneuver I just want

1855.91 --> 1862.93
to see confirmation of one claim that

1859.06 --> 1866.77
you made and that is that you are

1862.93 --> 1868.27
supposedly a teacher prove it prove it

1866.77 --> 1870.52
that you're a teacher I don't give a

1868.27 --> 1873.49
[ __ ] who's paying you or who's not

1870.52 --> 1877.99
paying you I just want to see that you

1873.49 --> 1880.99
really are a teacher that is all you

1877.99 --> 1884.2
know if you're gonna use it there's an

1880.99 --> 1887.52
argument as a stance then proof that you

1884.2 --> 1892.0800000000002
are and that you're not just a complete

1887.52 --> 1892.08
lying scumbag

1893.83 --> 1910.559
oh well if you are military intelligence

1906.549 --> 1910.559
then show me the contract

1914.429 --> 1921.249
show me the contract and who was

1918.279 --> 1924.07
[ __ ] enough to hire somebody that is

1921.249 --> 1929.049
that dumb as you to actually do it

1924.07 --> 1931.84
because I would suit well you're not

1929.049 --> 1934.389
gonna do it obviously but I I had

1931.84 --> 1935.9189999999999
something to say if I would sue them for

1934.389 --> 1941.35
total incompetence

1935.919 --> 1947.1090000000002
how can you hire somebody that [ __ ]

1941.35 --> 1950.9399999999998
to try and oppose this that's just total

1947.109 --> 1952.899
incompetence the one that's supposedly

1950.94 --> 1954.309
presupposing you're actually telling the

1952.899 --> 1955.869
truth and you're probably not probably

1954.309 --> 1956.95
never going to tell the truth about

1955.869 --> 1959.9189999999999
anything ever

1956.95 --> 1962.559
but let's presuppose that you are then

1959.919 --> 1964.769
they are even more incompetent than you

1962.559 --> 1964.769
are

1977.61 --> 1982.6499999999999
yeah can you imagine that somebody even

1980.55 --> 1987.77
more incompetent than conspiracy gets

1982.65 --> 1991.5900000000001
it's hard to imagine it's really hard

1987.77 --> 1993.95
also hard to look on without actually

1991.59 --> 1999.12
hurting yourself in the process

1993.95 --> 2001.4
no it's like like looking into flames of

1999.12 --> 2005.36
retardation and you get too close you

2001.4 --> 2008.8300000000002
may get mentally burned intelligence may

2005.36 --> 2012.8899999999999
believe burning away in the process

2008.83 --> 2015.1999999999998
it's like radiation you know if you get

2012.89 --> 2018.43
too close if you absorb too much it'll

2015.2 --> 2018.43
do damage over time

2045.15 --> 2049.64
let's not see you later just [ __ ] off

2050.76 --> 2054.71
filthy lying scumbag

2070.78 --> 2073.78
but

2087.919 --> 2090.819
you know what

2092.0 --> 2097.06
let's get a bit over the top here

2097.96 --> 2105.609
maybe I'm gonna save up some money

2106.07 --> 2111.8900000000003
it's probably gonna last the first I

2108.8 --> 2113.869
gotta get the PT 900 or B 1000 or

2111.89 --> 2115.58
whatever maybe I'm actually gonna offer

2113.869 --> 2120.88
some money I don't know how it's gonna

2115.58 --> 2124.609
be for somebody to find the real-life

2120.88 --> 2127.31
conspiracy cats to locate him and then

2124.609 --> 2129.98
if they can video themselves approaching

2127.31 --> 2133.22
him and then kicking him in the balls

2129.98 --> 2136.88
with maximum power putting that on video

2133.22 --> 2144.5299999999997
and then uploading that then I'll give

2136.88 --> 2147.13
him the money what do you say how much

2144.53 --> 2147.13
would that be worth

2149.58 --> 2154.92
and yeah if you're gonna do it yourself

2152.07 --> 2157.6800000000003
okay if you're actually that pathetic

2154.92 --> 2159.69
that you're gonna do it yourself that

2157.68 --> 2162.7799999999997
one of your friends or one of your

2159.69 --> 2166.2000000000003
fellow retards lying scumbags is

2162.78 --> 2168.1200000000003
actually gonna try to do that and then

2166.2 --> 2169.89
send it to me I'm not even gonna give it

2168.12 --> 2172.5899999999997
to you it's got to be somebody that I

2169.89 --> 2175.3199999999997
actually trust to be an actual person

2172.59 --> 2177.86
and not a freakin troll it's got to be a

2175.32 --> 2177.86
real person

2178.22 --> 2190.74
and just find him hunt him down find him

2185.34 --> 2192.96
and expose him expose who he is expose

2190.74 --> 2197.91
his lies exposed that he's not a teacher

2192.96 --> 2201.51
exposed that he's probably a clinical

2197.91 --> 2204.99
sociopath some kind but one of the more

2201.51 --> 2209.0
[ __ ] versions of that and that he's

2204.99 --> 2213.5299999999997
just being this despicable pretender

2209.0 --> 2213.53
pretending all these things and just

2214.14 --> 2218.3289999999997
it's like an ulcer of humanity

2227.93 --> 2234.16
now come on Constance don't be all sad

2247.86 --> 2250.86
yeah

2262.56 --> 2271.31
right so yeah every conspiracy catch the

2268.05 --> 2274.8
sock count is hereby permanently banned

2271.31 --> 2279.11
so if you spot a conspiracy cat sock

2274.8 --> 2279.11
accounts then please ban him

2304.5 --> 2313.96
good one Lottie says you do that right

2309.099 --> 2316.48
what Constance you know there's a little

2313.96 --> 2319.0
bit of everything look I'm not gonna do

2316.48 --> 2323.619
that every time but he's been stalking

2319.0 --> 2329.92
my freaking hangouts and yeah he was

2323.619 --> 2331.119
part of it at some point and he's now

2329.92 --> 2332.98
yeah

2331.119 --> 2336.6400000000003
trolling the [ __ ] out of it I'm just

2332.98 --> 2342.069
calling him out just calling him out big

2336.64 --> 2345.49
force for real and that's it after this

2342.069 --> 2347.29
is no more no more real attention I'm

2345.49 --> 2351.99
gonna give him like don't go to his

2347.29 --> 2356.47
channel anyway total waste of time

2351.99 --> 2359.1899999999996
must be one of the worst actors the

2356.47 --> 2359.1899999999996
world has to offer

2366.51 --> 2372.69
but I should ban you for that and I went

2369.3 --> 2375.0800000000004
to the house she just actually ban you

2372.69 --> 2375.08
for that

2385.55 --> 2390.78
let's get that

2387.76 --> 2390.78
to other stuff

2440.41 --> 2449.43
oh yeah having another D&D game this

2445.39 --> 2449.43
evening really looking forward to it

2449.85 --> 2452.85
good

2474.02 --> 2480.36
although it's probably mostly comeback

2478.17 --> 2482.01
happy well yeah I got things prepared

2480.36 --> 2484.38
and I got it interesting

2482.01 --> 2487.98
there's no chart of how things will

2484.38 --> 2490.17
proceed and yeah can't wait that's right

2487.98 --> 2493.47
out it's going to be interesting also

2490.17 --> 2495.9500000000003
into yeah I love it when a plan comes

2493.47 --> 2495.95
together

2496.31 --> 2503.04
it's like the players in the back of

2500.73 --> 2505.38
their mind have been trying to fulfill a

2503.04 --> 2507.21
certain dubious quest for some time

2505.38 --> 2509.0
that's been out there for a long long

2507.21 --> 2512.43
time

2509.0 --> 2516.45
confliction and they've been trying to

2512.43 --> 2521.7799999999997
get something with that and now I'm

2516.45 --> 2526.3199999999997
going to give them the opportunity but

2521.78 --> 2528.4500000000003
like give it a little twist so that is

2526.32 --> 2531.69
actually becomes a slightly harder and

2528.45 --> 2535.0499999999997
like make everything as not straight

2531.69 --> 2537.4500000000003
forward as they hoped it will be and I

2535.05 --> 2539.2200000000003
love doing that it makes it very real

2537.45 --> 2544.08
because that's exactly what to be the

2539.22 --> 2547.6099999999997
world tends to do and it's gonna make a

2544.08 --> 2551.75
great story afterward I know it will

2547.61 --> 2551.75
whatever is really gonna happen

2557.11 --> 2569.92
but yeah that's the DND game so much

2564.97 --> 2577.0
possibilities with that and I really

2569.92 --> 2580.39
really hope that and I think I will be

2577.0 --> 2584.02
able to probably continue playing that

2580.39 --> 2586.06
for at least 10 years be awesome ten

2584.02 --> 2588.4
more years of that game I've played it

2586.06 --> 2589.36
for four years and have come so far

2588.4 --> 2594.82
already

2589.36 --> 2598.03
we're probably already on one third of

2594.82 --> 2601.84
the entire thing with options to expand

2598.03 --> 2603.88
making it potentially just 1/4 or 1/5 of

2601.84 --> 2608.6200000000003
the entire material that I can work with

2603.88 --> 2615.34
throughout the time of that growth which

2608.62 --> 2620.46
is pretty fast and I just looking so

2615.34 --> 2624.07
forward keeping on doing that so much so

2620.46 --> 2627.54
much like that is my consolidation price

2624.07 --> 2629.3700000000003
for my life sounds very

2627.54 --> 2634.83
wait but it's not really because it is

2629.37 --> 2637.2599999999998
so awesome to do it so awesome when when

2634.83 --> 2638.94
you got a real grip over the world and

2637.26 --> 2644.9100000000003
the world design and you learn so much

2638.94 --> 2649.7400000000002
of how it just works to do it and how

2644.91 --> 2653.5499999999997
you can guide a it's like a life movie

2649.74 --> 2656.3999999999996
theater thing that is playing out in the

2653.55 --> 2659.61
minds of the players and it's up to the

2656.4 --> 2662.2200000000003
game master to not break that suspense

2659.61 --> 2665.34
of disbelief and continue the story and

2662.22 --> 2667.95
you can even meta talk about it with

2665.34 --> 2670.71
your players like yeah what are you or

2667.95 --> 2672.8399999999997
what is the character expecting and what

2670.71 --> 2676.44
is your criticism about how these things

2672.84 --> 2680.34
went how could I improve the suspense of

2676.44 --> 2684.54
disbelief so you can both meta talk to

2680.34 --> 2687.1200000000003
perfect the right that is an ongoing

2684.54 --> 2690.5
process and that is just awesome thing

2687.12 --> 2690.5
that's just so awesome to do

2702.71 --> 2706.849
all right yeah

2709.72 --> 2714.8799999999997
you know what Nick technically you're

2712.18 --> 2718.93
incorrect you can actually prove models

2714.88 --> 2723.1600000000003
and science because a model is basically

2718.93 --> 2727.45
a complex hypothesis and if you manage

2723.16 --> 2732.85
to prove every aspect of that complex

2727.45 --> 2735.21
hypothesis with a basic hypothesis then

2732.85 --> 2740.3199999999997
yeah with each independent variable

2735.21 --> 2743.65
being provable then if every element is

2740.32 --> 2745.96
proven then if that complex hypothesis

2743.65 --> 2751.08
works out then it is technically

2745.96 --> 2755.4700000000003
scientifically proven but it the

2751.08 --> 2758.34
antecedents for it the work is that all

2755.47 --> 2761.1699999999996
the elements have been proven

2758.34 --> 2766.03
scientifically with a basic hypothesis

2761.17 --> 2768.79
each and every one of them yeah that's

2766.03 --> 2773.02
something else that's that's really

2768.79 --> 2774.82
really tough I on the top of my mind I

2773.02 --> 2778.81
can't even think of an example where

2774.82 --> 2785.7400000000002
that has been successfully done probably

2778.81 --> 2788.95
some out there but go science stuff man

2785.74 --> 2791.3799999999997
it's not basic you know they they've

2788.95 --> 2794.9199999999996
made us believe that science is so

2791.38 --> 2798.28
simple everybody can do science yeah

2794.92 --> 2801.16
everybody can make an observation find

2798.28 --> 2805.27
the correlation and then make a claim

2801.16 --> 2809.5
about why what causes it but that's not

2805.27 --> 2813.28
science that's pseudoscience because it

2809.5 --> 2818.43
isn't that easy it's basic it's

2813.28 --> 2818.4300000000003
simplistic in nature but it's not easy

2823.13 --> 2826.76
science is a method

2861.53 --> 2866.8100000000004
hmm oh by the way I just realized

2864.41 --> 2870.47
something about conspiracy cats in my

2866.81 --> 2874.46
presume challenge it might actually not

2870.47 --> 2877.52
do anything because if anything he may

2874.46 --> 2884.5
be a typical guy that actually no longer

2877.52 --> 2891.04
has any balls maybe he is like a

2884.5 --> 2894.86
transitioning transsexual or even worse

2891.04 --> 2898.88
but I dare not go there there may be

2894.86 --> 2905.0
other reasons why why something in that

2898.88 --> 2908.1800000000003
direction maybe there and it yeah he was

2905.0 --> 2911.09
that despicable that explains why he was

2908.18 --> 2915.02
acting so despicable so I'm not putting

2911.09 --> 2920.6200000000003
any direct correlations there I'm not

2915.02 --> 2925.31
even going beyond ultra meta talk but

2920.62 --> 2928.06
yeah maybe he is a eunuch he kind of

2925.31 --> 2928.06
looks like one

2933.71 --> 2939.15
so maybe that's why he thinks it's so

2936.48 --> 2943.4
funny oh ha ha

2939.15 --> 2943.4
I have no balls to begin with

2950.42 --> 2955.9700000000003
let's not get too deep into it it'll

2952.97 --> 2958.48
give him just more credit than he

2955.97 --> 2958.48
deserves

2961.96 --> 2969.89
hmm so yeah I am still open for guests

2966.309 --> 2972.099
was all the time so what are you waiting

2969.89 --> 2972.0989999999997
for

3006.56 --> 3018.109
I've got so many people in Chad I mean

3011.599 --> 3020.96
in Skype chat but yeah it seems so he's

3018.109 --> 3024.0699999999997
the same problem they're like oh god

3020.96 --> 3031.09
want chat but they're just not awake

3024.07 --> 3031.09
either it's too late it's too early

3032.109 --> 3036.729
and if you're going to be watching

3033.729 --> 3037.89
videos all nights yeah you're not gonna

3036.729 --> 3041.339
get up that early

3037.89 --> 3041.339
it's up to you

3047.38 --> 3050.599
[Applause]

3082.52 --> 3085.09
right

3096.2 --> 3099.22
yeah you know what

3100.94 --> 3109.25
there's different ways to read things

3104.65 --> 3111.349
there is just glancing at it trying to

3109.25 --> 3117.009
lift out something good or something

3111.349 --> 3117.009
interesting and then there is like

3118.21 --> 3125.599
conveying it to somebody else like

3122.41 --> 3130.359
reading something when I read something

3125.599 --> 3133.4900000000002
I focus mostly on keeping up the tempo

3130.359 --> 3138.009
making it complete I'm probably not

3133.49 --> 3141.14
actually going to look let my mind even

3138.009 --> 3145.63
get into what is really being talked

3141.14 --> 3149.359
about because I'm just reading it out

3145.63 --> 3152.329
trying to convey the message while if I

3149.359 --> 3154.069
scan over think yeah that can go in all

3152.329 --> 3156.5890000000004
directions there are so many ways to

3154.069 --> 3158.089
read things there's reading to see if

3156.589 --> 3161.15
there is a response to something

3158.089 --> 3163.3089999999997
specific you're saying or trying to see

3161.15 --> 3165.89
what is going on there what are they

3163.309 --> 3172.7000000000003
doing and that may take a little bit

3165.89 --> 3174.529
more time to read because you have to to

3172.7 --> 3176.91
do that you have to look beyond what is

3174.529 --> 3182.21
literally being written down

3176.91 --> 3182.21
and see the process behind it

3185.37 --> 3190.74
and I do this often

3188.46 --> 3193.29
especially when I go into heavy subjects

3190.74 --> 3198.9199999999996
then I immediately go to chat after that

3193.29 --> 3203.94
and just see what is the response that

3198.92 --> 3208.83
sends you people to me are almost like a

3203.94 --> 3211.71
divination instead of throwing bones or

3208.83 --> 3214.71
reading cards or using my geometry a

3211.71 --> 3220.02
calculator I'm just looking at how you

3214.71 --> 3223.77
respond to what I said to see how it

3220.02 --> 3227.4
touched you how you evade or if you're

3223.77 --> 3230.4
taking pause if you're actually

3227.4 --> 3232.86
responding and to what level and then a

3230.4 --> 3235.14
combination of all that in all these

3232.86 --> 3241.07
impressions together give me like a

3235.14 --> 3243.48
painting of how what I said has been

3241.07 --> 3245.55
responded to and draw my deduced

3243.48 --> 3248.85
conclusions from it like okay this is

3245.55 --> 3253.6200000000003
too much or this is exactly what they

3248.85 --> 3257.25
need or this is very enthusiastic the

3253.62 --> 3263.0299999999997
inspiring or it is actually strangling

3257.25 --> 3263.03
and deflection inducing and that is

3263.95 --> 3271.89
those are my are we nyan psychological

3267.22 --> 3271.89
studies purely in its pure intuition

3273.6 --> 3279.74
and knowledge of just what people do and

3277.5 --> 3279.74
why

3282.51 --> 3285.11
so

3285.65 --> 3290.39
the chef just died

3298.0 --> 3300.599
you

3311.37 --> 3314.93
right Tony B you're correct

3317.24 --> 3325.93
yeah I know

3326.619 --> 3332.88
yeah meta talk analysis and

3333.09 --> 3339.57
the yeah when people explain to you how

3336.27 --> 3342.57
you are being analyzed that tends to

3339.57 --> 3345.75
create indeed some kind of pressure it

3342.57 --> 3349.4700000000003
is almost like a sensation of slight

3345.75 --> 3354.99
dehumanization you feel too much watch

3349.47 --> 3357.9599999999996
that it's like yeah you feel like you're

3354.99 --> 3360.66
being watched it makes it slightly

3357.96 --> 3363.54
uncomfortable it's weird just natural

3360.66 --> 3365.8399999999997
and still do it because it's just part

3363.54 --> 3372.5
of what I do explain everything

3365.84 --> 3372.5
everything and trying to make

3373.13 --> 3383.11
the details a normal thing to talk about

3377.77 --> 3387.23
I'm trying to convey in my own way

3383.11 --> 3391.9100000000003
continually my personal development

3387.23 --> 3396.35
process to make the culture that I

3391.91 --> 3398.99
crafted for myself to improve myself and

3396.35 --> 3403.58
to learn skills and to analyze and to

3398.99 --> 3407.62
convey information and create a new

3403.58 --> 3410.87
depths within them to put this out there

3407.62 --> 3413.45
for others to be able to take that on

3410.87 --> 3417.14
themselves to see that it is there that

3413.45 --> 3420.1099999999997
it is an option and how far you can get

3417.14 --> 3422.6
with this it's a valuable personal

3420.11 --> 3424.9100000000003
culture in my opinion like I'm still

3422.6 --> 3427.37
gonna be me and I have my own

3424.91 --> 3429.95
conceptions of Who I am and it's often

3427.37 --> 3434.81
not that great I don't really have high

3429.95 --> 3437.93
regards for myself really but this

3434.81 --> 3442.13
methodology this personal culture of

3437.93 --> 3445.62
learning and conveying and improving

3442.13 --> 3449.37
yourself I'm proud of that

3445.62 --> 3451.7999999999997
and I'm very glad I got it I can barely

3449.37 --> 3457.5299999999997
imagine having survived even a quarter

3451.8 --> 3460.44
off this life without it so yeah I think

3457.53 --> 3464.5800000000004
that's well worth the effort of putting

3460.44 --> 3466.73
that out there to see others taking it

3464.58 --> 3466.73
on

3473.72 --> 3477.6699999999996
so I guess no guests today

3480.4 --> 3483.119
yeah

3489.48 --> 3499.7400000000002
Oh Garen B says she has a neutral

3495.27 --> 3502.31
birthday hmm all right oh by the way the

3499.74 --> 3502.31
empty matrix

3504.88 --> 3507.4790000000003
thank you

3524.07 --> 3526.76
let's see

3527.99 --> 3531.1499999999996
[Music]

3542.619 --> 3545.219
yeah

3547.32 --> 3558.7000000000003
mm right yeah not exactly what I had in

3553.51 --> 3562.0
mind but it looked nice at least now my

3558.7 --> 3566.2
idea to care and be thank you that like

3562.0 --> 3568.54
the the music by Chris that was good

3566.2 --> 3571.24
that was exactly where I wanted it as

3568.54 --> 3573.64
well but I thought just let the birds be

3571.24 --> 3578.5299999999997
the birds and only in the last scene

3573.64 --> 3582.5499999999997
basically as the music rounds out showed

3578.53 --> 3585.4900000000002
the title pretty big in your face like

3582.55 --> 3587.6200000000003
in front of the bushes and then

3585.49 --> 3590.62
simultaneously Chris Perry in the corner

3587.62 --> 3593.2
so not scrolling by during the entire

3590.62 --> 3594.94
video that that's not exactly what I had

3593.2 --> 3598.2999999999997
in mind I just wanted to give the

3594.94 --> 3601.84
attention to the birdies and the music

3598.3 --> 3604.0800000000004
and let the title slip in let's say at

3601.84 --> 3604.08
the

3608.66 --> 3615.5899999999997
is it so Agni

3617.02 --> 3622.36
I'd have to

3619.96 --> 3629.61
because it has the a musical timing is

3622.36 --> 3634.03
everything that right so at the to any

3629.61 --> 3636.67
423 second mark somewhere over there the

3634.03 --> 3639.1800000000003
last guitar note is Ling

3636.67 --> 3645.64
that's perfect moment for the title to

3639.18 --> 3646.8399999999997
to appear in my opinion but thanks

3645.64 --> 3651.0699999999997
thanks a lot

3646.84 --> 3654.34
Karen for for working on that that is

3651.07 --> 3656.23
indeed like very basic handwriting think

3654.34 --> 3661.3900000000003
that's exactly what I wanted you totally

3656.23 --> 3666.55
got it so yeah I am indeed quite lucky

3661.39 --> 3669.52
to have a talented friend and Ally Karen

3666.55 --> 3676.2400000000002
B thanks for that Daniel field it's

3669.52 --> 3678.43
really six pound sixty-six are you

3676.24 --> 3683.5499999999997
trying to convey some kind of message

3678.43 --> 3683.5499999999997
here thanks anyway though

3729.18 --> 3734.97
and you know it's just let's just get

3732.72 --> 3740.609
really annoying for a moment and say

3734.97 --> 3743.9399999999996
like what is 666 even signify because if

3740.609 --> 3747.65
y'all add it up what you're gonna get

3743.94 --> 3747.65
you're gonna get 9

3752.05 --> 3760.8900000000003
right

3754.15 --> 3760.89
you're just gonna get 9 so is 9

3763.22 --> 3771.1189999999997
yeah it's 9 it's always night Inge

3767.4 --> 3773.79
imatra there is only one number and that

3771.119 --> 3780.65
is when you add it all up that's what it

3773.79 --> 3780.65
is it's a game

3784.259 --> 3790.869
yeah it is

3785.89 --> 3795.8689999999997
in gematria 666 is 9 how no matter what

3790.869 --> 3795.869
you do with it yeah exactly you got it

3803.1 --> 3812.62
right oh maybe in a cyclical sense you

3807.52 --> 3816.55
could say ok 9 is the final cycle before

3812.62 --> 3821.23
it gets back to them like the 10 is a 1

3816.55 --> 3828.1800000000003
and a 0 let's that's why I do this I got

3821.23 --> 3832.45
this 10/10 star Alpha and Omega 1 and 0

3828.18 --> 3837.25
so yeah maybe the 666 is like the final

3832.45 --> 3841.8599999999997
piece before the cycle flips and starts

3837.25 --> 3845.32
over again I don't know that seems to be

3841.86 --> 3848.98
in a cyclical sense much more sensible

3845.32 --> 3852.75
than drawing conclusions about ethereal

3848.98 --> 3852.75
monsters or evils or

3861.539 --> 3865.849
geometry is not numerology

3869.45 --> 3876.1699999999996
well I think it is a form of numerology

3873.2 --> 3878.4199999999996
or numerology is a form of divination

3876.17 --> 3882.9500000000003
and so it's geometry so it's the each

3878.42 --> 3885.6800000000003
king in those tarot cards it's all a

3882.95 --> 3888.74
form of divination and definition - in

3885.68 --> 3892.22
my view I have come to this conclusion

3888.74 --> 3896.3289999999997
in actually practicing it from various

3892.22 --> 3898.6699999999996
angles for a long time not continually

3896.329 --> 3900.53
but just having been confronted with it

3898.67 --> 3907.15
and having dealt with it having an

3900.53 --> 3913.9300000000003
talent to do it it's all deduction based

3907.15 --> 3919.099
systems unreality on things

3913.93 --> 3921.339
with backgrounds that's what it is its

3919.099 --> 3921.339
definition

3921.71 --> 3934.51
reading things reading signs and then

3928.63 --> 3939.079
finding conclusions hmm oh cool

3934.51 --> 3939.6800000000003
Karen beach already home can't wait to

3939.079 --> 3955.7200000000003
see that

3939.68 --> 3955.72
thank you Karen all right

3955.81 --> 3962.17
I'll bet you you're absolutely on target

3958.84 --> 3967.05
with that different forms different

3962.17 --> 3967.05
sects different philosophical approaches

3968.62 --> 3974.2599999999998
the Voynich b2

3972.04 --> 3978.63
if you're I don't know if you're talking

3974.26 --> 3985.17
about the intro the chewiness the same -

3978.63 --> 3985.17
this is the slight modification of text

3995.44 --> 3998.04
and

4018.2 --> 4025.899
[Music]

4028.26 --> 4032.239
[Music]

4040.52 --> 4046.05
[Music]

4046.18 --> 4063.259
cool yeah good timing I if you can try

4058.67 --> 4065.69
to not let the text fade out also a bit

4063.259 --> 4068.93
bigger I really want to cover it to

4065.69 --> 4070.759
cover this screen and I don't know for

4068.93 --> 4075.2
some reason it was kind of weird and

4070.759 --> 4078.799
blocky I don't know why that is me but

4075.2 --> 4079.819
it seemed blocky and blurry distorted I

4078.799 --> 4083.17
don't know

4079.819 --> 4087.89
that's the rendering engine or anything

4083.17 --> 4090.2490000000003
but yeah the timing was almost entirely

4087.89 --> 4090.249
perfect

4090.47 --> 4096.429999999999
it's getting there thank you looking

4094.28 --> 4096.43
good

4122.84 --> 4131.97
so so we've gone been going for over an

4128.28 --> 4136.37
hour even I haven't even noticed yeah

4131.97 --> 4139.97
let's see is it Nathan I think today

4136.37 --> 4139.97
probably not right

4149.56 --> 4160.51
nope no I guess Flat Earth debates no

4156.859 --> 4160.51
longer gonna be in the weekends

4179.81 --> 4189.5
oh cool Randi has just uploaded a video

4183.95 --> 4191.9
as well it's 43 minutes ago the moon

4189.5 --> 4194.51
phases yeah he talked about that by the

4191.9 --> 4197.33
way on my show yesterday so that should

4194.51 --> 4203.38
be interesting take a look at that after

4197.33 --> 4203.38
this yeah right Karen

4207.61 --> 4217.87
what yeah Wow thanks to the parents help

4213.87 --> 4222.01
I think I'm going to have a complete and

4217.87 --> 4224.7699999999995
total intro exactly how I wanted it on

4222.01 --> 4228.610000000001
my hundredth episode so that's kind of

4224.77 --> 4231.46
cool thanks everyone for that and Karen

4228.61 --> 4233.2
B and Chris thank you so much for

4231.46 --> 4242.52
helping me out and getting it done

4233.2 --> 4246.57
exactly perfect timing now all that's

4242.52 --> 4249.25
left for me to work out isn't the sound

4246.57 --> 4252.67
because yeah I know the sound is still

4249.25 --> 4256.0
relatively scratchy and I've been trying

4252.67 --> 4259.26
the audio banana thing but yeah the

4256.0 --> 4265.56
instructions aren't exactly working out

4259.26 --> 4270.64
need some assistance with that also I

4265.56 --> 4275.410000000001
will absolutely will order a pop filter

4270.64 --> 4277.12
for my microphone as soon as I

4275.41 --> 4283.599999999999
have a little financial maneuvering room

4277.12 --> 4287.47
to do that you know what maybe I'll

4283.6 --> 4291.160000000001
order that with with the first Super

4287.47 --> 4293.35
chat influx on my bank account as soon

4291.16 --> 4296.7699999999995
as that comes out I'll just uh yeah I'll

4293.35 --> 4301.72
probably not be able to get p900 with

4296.77 --> 4304.3
the first influx right away but I will

4301.72 --> 4309.64
definitely be able to get a pop my the

4304.3 --> 4312.25
pop filter so I will do that and and

4309.64 --> 4314.17
make peace with a lot of people out

4312.25 --> 4314.77
there that just hate a pepper boop boop

4314.17 --> 4319.18
boop

4314.77 --> 4321.34
just hate that some people be aggravated

4319.18 --> 4326.68
every time it happens but sorry it's

4321.34 --> 4330.07
just I'm just a guy on YouTube I'm not a

4326.68 --> 4335.2300000000005
professional radio person I don't have

4330.07 --> 4340.29
personnel smoothing out the edges you

4335.23 --> 4340.29
know just figuring it out as I go

4343.67 --> 4349.16
and yeah it'll happen don't worry about

4346.95 --> 4349.16
it

4351.66 --> 4358.21
just took me only two or three years to

4355.6 --> 4360.910000000001
get there Oh

4358.21 --> 4364.05
although I did get the really much

4360.91 --> 4368.93
better webcam pretty quickly I think I

4364.05 --> 4370.320000000001
get it I think I did like three or four

4368.93 --> 4373.42
[Music]

4370.32 --> 4374.98
flat earth talks well I didn't even know

4373.42 --> 4378.9
if I even called it for leather talks

4374.98 --> 4382.049999999999
back then with the old super crappy

4378.9 --> 4384.549999999999
webcam that was already 10 years old and

4382.05 --> 4386.47
so I got a new one that got it pretty

4384.55 --> 4393.9400000000005
cheaply and I'm very satisfied

4386.47 --> 4396.280000000001
it's my no logitech webcam basic but

4393.94 --> 4399.5199999999995
very functional and yeah I think the

4396.28 --> 4402.07
resolution is good don't have a lot of

4399.52 --> 4403.93
focusing problems although it does focus

4402.07 --> 4409.66
a bit in and out sometimes and

4403.93 --> 4412.39
especially when it's moved does that but

4409.66 --> 4414.49
you know sometimes when you buy

4412.39 --> 4416.860000000001
something cheap it doesn't turn out to

4414.49 --> 4421.15
be total crap can actually be just

4416.86 --> 4428.0199999999995
plenty plenty for what you need that's a

4421.15 --> 4432.25
good thing it's good that you don't

4428.02 --> 4435.97
always have to lead in some way every

4432.25 --> 4439.5
time you just want to be so yeah you

4435.97 --> 4439.5
want to be somewhat competent

4447.92 --> 4455.24
yeah

4450.78 --> 4460.19
mmm-hmm I am gonna round out the show

4455.24 --> 4460.19

4725.719 --> 4730.639
went away again so yeah thanks for

4728.57 --> 4732.679
popping by the empty matrix if there was

4730.639 --> 4735.769
something you wanted to talk about it's

4732.679 --> 4738.829
not like I'm gonna forbid you from doing

4735.769 --> 4742.610000000001
that but I was kind of in the middle of

4738.829 --> 4744.829
rounding out my show anyway

4742.61 --> 4746.808999999999
if you want to you can help me out

4744.829 --> 4749.409

4746.809 --> 4749.409000000001
works and

4751.61 --> 4755.929999999999
