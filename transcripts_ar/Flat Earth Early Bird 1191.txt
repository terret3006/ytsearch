6.09 --> 37.56
[Music]

morning welcome to flat earth early bird

66.799 --> 70.56

72.56 --> 77.68
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

74.799 --> 80.159
weekend and please also do support me

77.68 --> 83.60000000000001

and the membership system join button

83.6 --> 89.439
and yeah that would be much appreciated

87.6 --> 91.119
right so

89.439 --> 93.52
yeah

91.119 --> 97.439
contrast to yesterday today

93.52 --> 99.67999999999999
is again this glorious

97.439 --> 103.03999999999999
glorious sunny day

99.68 --> 103.04
it's really warm

103.2 --> 106.56
or at least it's inside of this room

105.36 --> 111.28
like

106.56 --> 113.68
it was kind of nauseating warm in here

111.28 --> 117.6
like literally it's getting a bit better

113.68 --> 117.60000000000001
though but i don't know why it's just

120.719 --> 124.96
it was a little too warm

123.68 --> 129.03900000000002
right

124.96 --> 132.07999999999998
but outside it's just beautiful

129.039 --> 135.67999999999998
bright blue no clouds

132.08 --> 135.68
no trails being left

136.239 --> 139.68
it does seem like a little bit of

138.56 --> 142.64000000000001
grayish

139.68 --> 146.0
more at the horizon but it's

142.64 --> 146.0
it's all just blended in

146.48 --> 154.23899999999998
yeah the wind it's still there sometimes

150.4 --> 158.239
but overall it seems kind of weird still

154.239 --> 158.239
and yeah that contributes to the heat

160.72 --> 166.92
right so yeah i'm

162.4 --> 166.92000000000002
currently even in my shorts

170.0 --> 173.599
because if it's going to be weather like

171.68 --> 177.28
this

173.599 --> 179.599
then i probably will eventually just

177.28 --> 181.92
doing my shows in white shirts because

179.599 --> 184.23899999999998
this is just warm guys this is really

181.92 --> 185.28
warm

184.239 --> 189.519
yeah

185.28 --> 189.519
ah not my camera again

191.36 --> 198.48000000000002

what the

212.799 --> 219.12
okay let me show that again

215.84 --> 222.12
freaking shitty camera

219.12 --> 222.12
right

229.84 --> 233.879
don't blur up

246.239 --> 248.56
right

251.519 --> 258.76
bright and beautiful oh look at the jack

254.879 --> 258.76
dog taking a bath

270.56 --> 274.16
i just put that water there

274.479 --> 281.88
i don't blame the jackdaw it is like

277.759 --> 281.88
very inviting to do that

290.32 --> 293.32
hmm

296.0 --> 299.0
um

311.199 --> 313.84000000000003
all right

321.68 --> 324.40000000000003
that's

322.84 --> 327.84
great

324.4 --> 327.84
i love sharing that sort of thing

334.32 --> 338.8
anyway hello kevlar first in chat

337.44 --> 341.68
elise g

338.8 --> 341.68
jeff gas head

342.08 --> 351.639
youtube flattersage good to see you all

345.919 --> 351.639
it is monday the 21st of march 2022

353.039 --> 355.28
ah

355.6 --> 358.56
decent rest

357.52 --> 359.44
but

358.56 --> 362.08
was

359.44 --> 362.08
the yeah

362.16 --> 366.47900000000004
restless despite all that i don't know

364.56 --> 368.96
what it is i try to call my healer this

366.479 --> 371.68
morning but

368.96 --> 374.56
i think he's probably too busy he's very

371.68 --> 378.0
busy these days and it's not surprising

374.56 --> 378.0
since this is pretty much

378.4 --> 382.479
the biggest psychological warfare

380.8 --> 385.36
periods

382.479 --> 385.35999999999996
in our lifetime

386.24 --> 391.52
so there's going to be a lot of problem

387.68 --> 394.08
with spiritual issues being possessed by

391.52 --> 395.44
all kinds of effects

394.08 --> 397.52
like the

395.44 --> 400.96
unrealness spirit

397.52 --> 402.56
which you typically get from media if

400.96 --> 404.96
you if you

402.56 --> 408.4
allow yourself to believe their [ __ ]

404.96 --> 410.08
you get possessed by that thing

408.4 --> 412.4
so there's a lot of people out there

410.08 --> 415.19899999999996
that have that apparently

412.4 --> 417.12
and i mean i'm not like the weakest

415.199 --> 419.28000000000003
person right

417.12 --> 422.16
that he helps

419.28 --> 424.63899999999995
so yeah if i'm already kind of bothered

422.16 --> 426.47900000000004
by that there are some people out there

424.639 --> 428.96000000000004
to which it's like a real daily

426.479 --> 428.96
challenge

433.52 --> 437.84
anyway hey matthew hall

442.24 --> 445.68
so yeah

443.44 --> 447.36
i don't know been kind of nauseated in

445.68 --> 449.599
the morning it's weird

447.36 --> 452.16
i i feel like it's sort of allergy

449.599 --> 456.15999999999997
related i also i'm like super snotty

452.16 --> 456.16
it's super annoying it's

456.56 --> 461.039
in the beginning it just won't stop it

458.8 --> 463.919
really like i need like an hour before

461.039 --> 466.15999999999997
all that stops

463.919 --> 467.35999999999996
like despite going out for groceries

466.16 --> 471.59900000000005
like still

467.36 --> 471.599
even while doing that felt nauseated

472.96 --> 475.71999999999997
right but i think it's just because of

475.52 --> 477.75899999999996
the

475.72 --> 480.319
[Music]

477.759 --> 481.599
just the transformation of nature out

480.319 --> 483.44
there

481.599 --> 484.96
i have a lot of like correlating

483.44 --> 487.36
memories with

484.96 --> 490.15999999999997
feeling like this during early spring

487.36 --> 490.16
time and all that

490.479 --> 494.71999999999997
especially with temperature transitions

493.199 --> 497.12
transitions

494.72 --> 497.12
anyway

502.4 --> 507.71999999999997
no sleep last night we

504.319 --> 507.72
okay youtube

508.0 --> 511.44
yeah you gotta be careful with that

515.36 --> 520.88
yeah with me my issue i think also is

517.599 --> 523.599
that i just i had dinner too late

520.88 --> 524.959
or like second dinner like my regular

523.599 --> 527.519
dinner

524.959 --> 530.0
at a decent time sort of

527.519 --> 530.0
but then

530.959 --> 535.8389999999999
like after 12 o'clock i i got really

533.6 --> 538.16
hungry and i'm like i i won't be able to

535.839 --> 539.2
suppress this hunger so i just got like

538.16 --> 540.64
dinner

539.2 --> 543.2
a hamburger

540.64 --> 544.959
but that's really late to start eating

543.2 --> 549.5600000000001
like a full meal

544.959 --> 549.56
that might have some influence as well

553.92 --> 557.1999999999999
overall it's better to not just

556.24 --> 559.92
eat

557.2 --> 564.32
big meals like after 12 o'clock for me

559.92 --> 564.3199999999999
12 at night anyway

565.839 --> 568.5600000000001
oh

566.72 --> 570.9590000000001
might as well stay awake oh you're gonna

568.56 --> 572.88
pull through sheesh okay good luck with

570.959 --> 575.1999999999999
that

572.88 --> 578.24
take it easy

575.2 --> 578.24
a rubber digital

579.6 --> 584.0
right i got some bonus gusto

584.24 --> 588.72
i was hoping that like the extra herbs

586.72 --> 590.5600000000001
that i don't really have a lot of

588.72 --> 592.72
ginseng

590.56 --> 594.0
but because i i rarely take this i had

592.72 --> 596.8000000000001
hoped like

594.0 --> 600.0
adding the extra stuff

596.8 --> 603.1999999999999
would kind of help me restore

600.0 --> 606.64
i think it might be working

603.2 --> 606.6400000000001
hey what's going on

607.2 --> 610.32
youtube was stalling

613.04 --> 616.5999999999999
what's going on

618.24 --> 621.12
hey rick back

627.279 --> 633.56
if you go to sleep you'll be out of sync

629.839 --> 633.5600000000001
for days on end

634.48 --> 636.88
maybe

638.24 --> 643.279
it all depends on what you're gonna do

640.079 --> 644.8389999999999
with it if you just take like

643.279 --> 649.04
a

644.839 --> 652.0790000000001
sleep you could like try to force

649.04 --> 653.92
yourself to basically just

652.079 --> 657.8389999999999
go to sleep earlier even though you're

653.92 --> 661.1999999999999
not super tired after all that

657.839 --> 662.0
gotta meditate yourself to sleep

661.2 --> 663.839
i

662.0 --> 666.88
for me that's not too

663.839 --> 666.8800000000001
too much of an issue

666.959 --> 671.68
the most important part is that you just

668.64 --> 672.4399999999999
gets get a grip over when you get boost

671.68 --> 675.4399999999999
of

672.44 --> 676.24
enthusiasm when it's like really out of

675.44 --> 678.48
out

676.24 --> 681.04
in the wrong time slot right that's the

678.48 --> 684.399
thing that's most influential i've

681.04 --> 684.399
noticed for myself at least

686.72 --> 693.44
i need a slab freezing okay

690.48 --> 697.24
hey goldie mckerman

693.44 --> 697.24
getting you a wrench

706.959 --> 709.1999999999999
right

710.399 --> 716.279
mood has been over the place because of

712.079 --> 716.279
changing seasons yeah

717.6 --> 722.32
i'm just noticing that

719.76 --> 726.24
it's almost annoying to me

722.32 --> 726.24
that i'm thinking about women a lot

727.279 --> 731.36
and not just like

729.12 --> 734.48
thank god i'm not thinking about porn or

731.36 --> 734.48
anything right

734.639 --> 737.6
but just like

738.72 --> 742.9590000000001
constantly imagining what it would be

740.8 --> 745.8389999999999
like to basically bump into a girl that

742.959 --> 745.8389999999999
would be attracted

746.399 --> 749.76
i

747.68 --> 750.959
it's been a long time

749.76 --> 752.24
it's

750.959 --> 754.56
dude

752.24 --> 757.2
a long long time like

754.56 --> 757.1999999999999
10 years

757.519 --> 760.8
sheesh

758.639 --> 763.839
i can't believe i've been single for

760.8 --> 763.8389999999999
almost a decade

769.68 --> 773.7199999999999
but i'm okay with that

785.6 --> 790.16
you leave effie talks on all night oh

788.399 --> 792.48
yes

790.16 --> 795.12
that's you doing that

792.48 --> 797.2
although if you're doing that

795.12 --> 798.839
that might be that you feel having a

797.2 --> 801.6800000000001
sensation

798.839 --> 803.6
of loneliness

801.68 --> 804.7199999999999
as a spring response

803.6 --> 807.0400000000001
right

804.72 --> 808.8000000000001
because why would you keep on having

807.04 --> 810.56
chatter

808.8 --> 812.8
in the background it's usually because

810.56 --> 815.04
you don't want to be alone

812.8 --> 817.279
why do you not want to be alone usually

815.04 --> 818.399
because you feel alone why would you

817.279 --> 821.279
feel alone

818.399 --> 823.76
because it's springtime and that's a

821.279 --> 826.079
natural impulse to kind of force you to

823.76 --> 828.56
start connecting up right in order to

826.079 --> 831.92
procreate that's the instinct

828.56 --> 831.92
so it is logical

832.24 --> 835.839
just

833.36 --> 838.32
try to be aware of it and don't let it

835.839 --> 838.32
take your

838.399 --> 843.72
don't let it suck all the time out of

840.56 --> 843.7199999999999
your day

844.639 --> 852.76
what orphan read and validation oh god

849.36 --> 852.76
when was that

859.839 --> 864.72
the one

861.519 --> 868.48
the jet one from then oh so you're

864.72 --> 868.48
watching old hangouts

869.04 --> 872.56
are you having a bit of nostalgia are

871.199 --> 876.24
you having a bit of

872.56 --> 876.2399999999999
flat earth awakening nostalgia

876.56 --> 883.8389999999999
i mean i wouldn't blame you you know

879.68 --> 885.5999999999999
it was super intense back then

883.839 --> 887.6800000000001
everybody was like all dough wide and

885.6 --> 890.399
like whoa

887.68 --> 892.88
freaking flat earth dude

890.399 --> 892.88
i get it

895.839 --> 900.32
i i still get a bit like that even when

898.16 --> 901.12
i watch my old flat earth talks because

900.32 --> 905.279
i

901.12 --> 905.279
you can feel that through me that i have

905.6 --> 910.6800000000001
that sensation as well in those videos

935.279 --> 938.56
hello steamy traveler

938.8 --> 943.92
am i looking forward to establish a new

941.12 --> 943.92
relationship

944.639 --> 946.88
no

947.12 --> 952.0
i'm really not

949.68 --> 952.88
that might sound a bit weird

952.0 --> 956.72
but

952.88 --> 959.279
like every memory i even have

956.72 --> 962.48
of of hooking up with a girl throughout

959.279 --> 966.0
my life whether i was young or older

962.48 --> 967.759
it always started out with me being very

966.0 --> 969.12
seriously sick

967.759 --> 972.5600000000001
a lot

969.12 --> 972.5600000000001
it's like oh with love

972.72 --> 976.72
ah goddess i can't stop thinking about

975.36 --> 979.6800000000001
it ah

976.72 --> 981.759
yeah no and not looking forward to that

979.68 --> 983.68
i'm much more looking forward to just

981.759 --> 987.1990000000001
kind of be

983.68 --> 988.56
a bit more stoic towards the women

987.199 --> 991.8389999999999
like that

988.56 --> 995.199
and to not just immediately have the

991.839 --> 997.519
tentacles dug into my belly again to do

995.199 --> 1000.079
that

997.519 --> 1002.399
like i want to be with women i don't

1000.079 --> 1004.3199999999999
necessarily want to fall in love all

1002.399 --> 1007.04
over again like that

1004.32 --> 1009.0400000000001
because that was quite a nightmare at

1007.04 --> 1011.8389999999999
the end

1009.04 --> 1014.88
right every time i've ever really fallen

1011.839 --> 1016.9590000000001
in love like that it it like

1014.88 --> 1019.279
i knew even when it started like that

1016.959 --> 1021.199
could never be reciprocated

1019.279 --> 1023.8389999999999
like they're never gonna feel the same

1021.199 --> 1025.9189999999999
towards me like that so i kind of just

1023.839 --> 1028.48
don't want to do that anymore

1025.919 --> 1030.5590000000002
i'm kind of done with it i mean not done

1028.48 --> 1033.76
with women entirely but just done with

1030.559 --> 1036.799
falling aloft not doing it anymore

1033.76 --> 1039.799
and yeah in a way i do have control over

1036.799 --> 1039.799
it

1040.559 --> 1043.76
although

1041.679 --> 1046.5590000000002
yeah with my ex barely

1043.76 --> 1049.44
it was just too much all of it that she

1046.559 --> 1051.6
was was too much for me to handle

1049.44 --> 1054.64
like i could not prevent myself from

1051.6 --> 1054.6399999999999
falling in love with that

1057.36 --> 1063.1599999999999
but i don't expect that to happen

1059.2 --> 1063.16
anytime soon again

1070.559 --> 1074.8799999999999
you don't want to be dreaming about

1072.64 --> 1078.5590000000002
nathan teabagging someone

1074.88 --> 1081.2
i don't dream about that goldie

1078.559 --> 1084.24
thank god well yeah

1081.2 --> 1088.48
i do have a lot of like visuals in my

1084.24 --> 1088.48
mind relating to like that

1090.08 --> 1095.1999999999998
i mean at this point

1092.48 --> 1097.44
there could literally be cartoons drawn

1095.2 --> 1097.44
like

1098.24 --> 1102.64
funny cartoons related to that

1100.88 --> 1103.679
like there could be done it like that's

1102.64 --> 1107.96
gonna

1103.679 --> 1107.96
resonate with a whole bunch of people

1109.679 --> 1115.76
but no i i don't

1111.919 --> 1115.76
don't think about that sort of thing

1116.4 --> 1121.679
now what i usually dream about with

1119.12 --> 1124.4799999999998
women is like

1121.679 --> 1124.48
weirdly enough

1125.44 --> 1130.16
it's like what would it be to have a

1127.84 --> 1133.1999999999998
woman that's kind of interested near me

1130.16 --> 1135.6000000000001
and then i'd constantly kind of

1133.2 --> 1138.88
obsess over what she's thinking about

1135.6 --> 1140.559
when she's not communicating with me

1138.88 --> 1142.64
is that weird

1140.559 --> 1144.32
because that is kind of what happens

1142.64 --> 1145.919
it's like i get like oh what she's

1144.32 --> 1146.8799999999999
thinking now what she's thinking now and

1145.919 --> 1149.2
like

1146.88 --> 1151.7600000000002
oh my god i hope that puzzle's gonna

1149.2 --> 1153.8400000000001
work out

1151.76 --> 1156.0
because you never really know women are

1153.84 --> 1157.76
so unpredictable like that they could

1156.0 --> 1161.039
just be like no

1157.76 --> 1161.039
no not gonna do this

1161.36 --> 1164.36
uh

1167.039 --> 1170.48
all right

1168.4 --> 1171.919
taking it on the tin

1170.48 --> 1173.84
chin dream

1171.919 --> 1178.2800000000002
yeah that's for anti-flat earthers to

1173.84 --> 1178.28
dream about not me

1179.76 --> 1182.76
so

1208.159 --> 1210.48
ah

1217.84 --> 1220.84
weird

1232.88 --> 1236.7990000000002
can't cut the gaps from the show because

1235.2 --> 1237.8400000000001
there is

1236.799 --> 1239.76
something

1237.84 --> 1244.76
in the background like buzzing what are

1239.76 --> 1244.76
you talking about not my show i hope

1260.64 --> 1263.64
okay

1274.64 --> 1277.8400000000001
who had the biggest gaps and who didn't

1276.559 --> 1281.28
oh dear

1277.84 --> 1283.6
so do i have the biggest gap

1281.28 --> 1287.3999999999999
jamie brown

1283.6 --> 1287.3999999999999
who was that again

1291.44 --> 1296.72
whoa

1293.52 --> 1297.679
that name rings a bell

1296.72 --> 1299.6000000000001
but

1297.679 --> 1300.5590000000002
he couldn't stop doing his thing didn't

1299.6 --> 1301.52
he

1300.559 --> 1305.84
god

1301.52 --> 1305.84
that's that's like years ago

1307.52 --> 1311.1589999999999
is he still around

1318.08 --> 1322.3999999999999
he looked like jesus

1321.2 --> 1323.8400000000001
nah

1322.4 --> 1326.88
a little

1323.84 --> 1329.6789999999999
oh jamie if i remember correctly he was

1326.88 --> 1329.679
kind of like a

1330.0 --> 1334.96
a pretty cool guy but he was like a

1332.32 --> 1336.32
little autistic or something and it was

1334.96 --> 1338.48
like visible

1336.32 --> 1341.84
well in the way that he talked and it

1338.48 --> 1341.84
was a bit monotonous

1342.799 --> 1348.32
vegan realist did he become a vegan huh

1349.039 --> 1354.64
but yeah he kind of stopped doing his

1351.2 --> 1357.28
thing because the trolls were really

1354.64 --> 1360.3200000000002
like bullying him and he did not know

1357.28 --> 1362.3999999999999
how to deal with that

1360.32 --> 1364.24
like he didn't like i know how to deal

1362.4 --> 1365.8400000000001
with that he did not know how to deal

1364.24 --> 1369.52
with that

1365.84 --> 1373.799
so he did kind of like drop

1369.52 --> 1373.799
stop doing flat earth i think

1374.64 --> 1379.3600000000001
and his channel got deleted or something

1377.679 --> 1382.3200000000002
for some reason

1379.36 --> 1384.08
but yeah that's like that's even before

1382.32 --> 1387.4399999999998
freaking

1384.08 --> 1389.84
before covet happened and all that

1387.44 --> 1389.8400000000001
years

1404.08 --> 1409.3999999999999
so he's all vegan now i guess

1406.4 --> 1409.4
whoopty

1417.76 --> 1422.0
yeah thank you for reminding me

1419.84 --> 1423.52
like sometimes i just completely forget

1422.0 --> 1425.36
about people

1423.52 --> 1426.4
because they kind of stop doing their

1425.36 --> 1428.24
thing

1426.4 --> 1431.8400000000001
but it's good to be reminded like oh

1428.24 --> 1431.84
yeah that guy used to be there too

1451.76 --> 1456.0
oh damn you too i didn't even know that

1454.08 --> 1458.48
that's that's annoying

1456.0 --> 1461.52
so somebody was mimicking him

1458.48 --> 1463.52
that's a really terrible that's that's

1461.52 --> 1467.799
that's mean

1463.52 --> 1467.799
that's a really mean thing to do

1472.799 --> 1476.4
have anti flatters been around since day

1475.12 --> 1478.0
one

1476.4 --> 1480.72
yeah

1478.0 --> 1480.72
absolutely

1481.039 --> 1487.08
but a lot more of them have joined the

1483.039 --> 1487.08
ranks over the years though

1503.52 --> 1506.52
uh

1522.32 --> 1525.32
hmm

1547.919 --> 1553.3600000000001
man you ever did you just recently

1550.159 --> 1556.3200000000002
watched those videos or is it just that

1553.36 --> 1559.9189999999999
ingrained in your memory youtube i i

1556.32 --> 1559.9189999999999
remember very little of all that

1566.72 --> 1572.24
yeah i know

1568.24 --> 1574.72
it is like five years ago that's right

1572.24 --> 1576.559
i mean when patricia was still like

1574.72 --> 1577.44
actually

1576.559 --> 1580.76
doing

1577.44 --> 1580.76
flat earth

1585.52 --> 1588.6399999999999
how time is flown

1591.679 --> 1595.3600000000001
right i hope all you new newer flat

1594.159 --> 1597.7600000000002
earthers

1595.36 --> 1599.84
are not like falling asleep with a bunch

1597.76 --> 1604.24
of old

1599.84 --> 1604.24
guys talking about things in the past

1606.32 --> 1610.08
because if you haven't been there you

1608.0 --> 1613.4
have no idea what we're talking about

1610.08 --> 1613.3999999999999
i'm sorry

1614.96 --> 1619.44
hey talking about anti flat earthers

1617.76 --> 1623.039
look who's there

1619.44 --> 1623.039
look who's there god

1625.279 --> 1629.2
do i miss patricia's show

1635.6 --> 1639.6789999999999
it was fun

1637.2 --> 1641.8400000000001
and it was what was great about it is

1639.679 --> 1641.8400000000001
that

1642.24 --> 1647.44
like her chat rooms were like the best

1646.0 --> 1649.44
she had like

1647.44 --> 1651.2
like martin luther's

1649.44 --> 1654.3200000000002
size crowd

1651.2 --> 1657.52
but it was just good and focused i

1654.32 --> 1659.84
really like that chat it was a great joy

1657.52 --> 1663.08
to be part of the of the chat during her

1659.84 --> 1663.08
live streams

1675.15 --> 1678.3090000000002
[Music]

1691.76 --> 1696.24
the comment acting chili

1697.6 --> 1702.32
oh my god youtube

1700.64 --> 1704.0800000000002
i haven't i have

1702.32 --> 1708.6399999999999
barely any memories

1704.08 --> 1711.12
but i do still recognize like trolls

1708.64 --> 1714.3990000000001
that have literally been doing exactly

1711.12 --> 1715.52
what they still do now seven years ago

1714.399 --> 1719.12
right

1715.52 --> 1720.96
like first generation dredge trolls

1719.12 --> 1722.6399999999999
that are just they haven't changed their

1720.96 --> 1725.52
name they haven't changed their behavior

1722.64 --> 1727.6000000000001
you're almost starting to wonder like

1725.52 --> 1729.9189999999999
are these actual people

1727.6 --> 1732.799
that never change or are they simply

1729.919 --> 1733.919
like programmed

1732.799 --> 1736.8799999999999
bots

1733.919 --> 1739.039
to act like a character and they just

1736.88 --> 1741.3600000000001
keep running the same program it's so

1739.039 --> 1741.36
weird

1745.52 --> 1748.96
a bit like tim osman here

1751.039 --> 1755.2
right although he's not like one of

1752.799 --> 1757.52
those first generations

1755.2 --> 1760.24
he did come in like after like the

1757.52 --> 1763.799
second wave

1760.24 --> 1763.799
or even a third

1769.12 --> 1773.52
seems like the same thing every day now

1771.52 --> 1774.8799999999999
yeah that's right

1773.52 --> 1777.039
because we won

1774.88 --> 1780.48
tim mossman yeah i know it's kind of

1777.039 --> 1783.84
still isn't it a war that is won

1780.48 --> 1783.84
is not very exciting

1784.399 --> 1787.6789999999999
because we did win

1786.32 --> 1790.1589999999999
utterly

1787.679 --> 1792.8400000000001
you have no troops left you have no

1790.159 --> 1796.0
moves left you have nothing left but

1792.84 --> 1798.24
denial and fabrications to try and

1796.0 --> 1802.159
comfort yourself that's all you have

1798.24 --> 1806.2
left as anti-flat earthers and ballers

1802.159 --> 1806.2
no you weren't first wave

1810.24 --> 1817.24
nobody knew who you were nor gave a [ __ ]

1814.0 --> 1817.24
dear mouseman

1824.159 --> 1829.6000000000001
i mean i literally know the freaking

1826.64 --> 1832.0800000000002
name tim osmond from a guy

1829.6 --> 1833.36
that stole your name

1832.08 --> 1836.559
okay

1833.36 --> 1839.279
that's where i know tim osman form

1836.559 --> 1842.399
then afterward i realized that there was

1839.279 --> 1845.039
a guy that was just called that that he

1842.399 --> 1847.6
stole your name right that's how i got

1845.039 --> 1850.84
to know you from another guy that stole

1847.6 --> 1850.84
your name

1851.039 --> 1855.44
are you were into flat earth before me

1853.12 --> 1858.76
oh really

1855.44 --> 1863.799
so you were into flat earth

1858.76 --> 1863.799
38 years ago were you

1882.64 --> 1886.96
right it's just that that's cute that

1885.12 --> 1889.279
you think that you're part of the first

1886.96 --> 1891.1200000000001
wave tim osman of anti-flight earth is i

1889.279 --> 1894.64
don't know why anybody would want to

1891.12 --> 1895.6789999999999
even admit that

1894.64 --> 1898.24
but

1895.679 --> 1900.0800000000002
nobody knew who the [ __ ] you were nobody

1898.24 --> 1901.36
cared

1900.08 --> 1903.76
yeah

1901.36 --> 1905.039
you came on the

1903.76 --> 1908.48
radar

1905.039 --> 1909.519
like after 2016.

1908.48 --> 1910.919
yeah

1909.519 --> 1913.36
not

1910.919 --> 1915.44
2014-15 yeah sure you were hanging

1913.36 --> 1919.1999999999998
around and in discord and [ __ ] nobody

1915.44 --> 1921.6000000000001
knew who you were nobody gave a [ __ ]

1919.2 --> 1924.0800000000002
yeah

1921.6 --> 1926.7199999999998
i mean mark taylor

1924.08 --> 1929.6
was around back then nobody gave a [ __ ]

1926.72 --> 1929.6000000000001
about him either

1939.6 --> 1943.84
anyway

1940.96 --> 1946.8400000000001
the [ __ ] obama what the hell

1943.84 --> 1946.84
uh

1948.08 --> 1953.279
no the war is one the argument is one

1950.96 --> 1955.2
steamy traveler we've won just because

1953.279 --> 1958.08
there's still

1955.2 --> 1960.0
[ __ ] being taught

1958.08 --> 1962.8799999999999
doesn't mean that we haven't won we've

1960.0 --> 1964.88
won the intellectual argument a hundred

1962.88 --> 1967.0390000000002
percent it's completely one there's

1964.88 --> 1968.7990000000002
there's like no more fighting to do

1967.039 --> 1970.08
effectively the only thing we're

1968.799 --> 1971.9189999999999
fighting now

1970.08 --> 1973.9189999999999
is people's

1971.919 --> 1975.8400000000001
ignorance willing ignorance and

1973.919 --> 1978.3990000000001
stubbornness that's what that's all

1975.84 --> 1981.6
we're doing it's all aftermath the the

1978.399 --> 1984.2399999999998
war is won we've won 100

1981.6 --> 1986.7199999999998
over there is no more fighting left

1984.24 --> 1986.72
we've won

1987.44 --> 1990.96
yeah just

1988.559 --> 1993.84
because there's still [ __ ]

1990.96 --> 1995.8400000000001
being taught to people

1993.84 --> 1996.559
doesn't mean that the war isn't one it

1995.84 --> 1998.9599999999998
is

1996.559 --> 2003.399
it's just that yeah

1998.96 --> 2003.3990000000001
propaganda persists you know

2004.96 --> 2008.3990000000001
but if we

2006.72 --> 2012.24
completely

2008.399 --> 2015.9189999999999
become immunized against the propaganda

2012.24 --> 2016.96
because we accept that the war is 100

2015.919 --> 2019.919
percent

2016.96 --> 2023.2
then maybe over time that propaganda

2019.919 --> 2025.6000000000001
will kind of falter slip into

2023.2 --> 2028.72
ridicule even by the ones that put it

2025.6 --> 2030.0
out like as this is old stuff

2028.72 --> 2031.679
right

2030.0 --> 2034.159
and then

2031.679 --> 2037.2
kind of be shoved into the back room

2034.159 --> 2039.3600000000001
without saying it to anybody right

2037.2 --> 2040.72
and it's just like oh yeah with globe

2039.36 --> 2043.6
earth

2040.72 --> 2044.88
oh yeah just not relevant right now

2043.6 --> 2047.039
right

2044.88 --> 2050.2400000000002
that might happen

2047.039 --> 2053.119
but the intellectual argument whether

2050.24 --> 2055.839
the earth is flat or a globe

2053.119 --> 2058.8
it that war is over

2055.839 --> 2061.919
it is a hundred percent over

2058.8 --> 2065.52
there is no more intellectual details to

2061.919 --> 2070.5989999999997
be figured out it's over we won

2065.52 --> 2070.599
the earth is flat it's not a globe

2086.56 --> 2089.56
so

2090.159 --> 2094.56
the history allah are we yeah yeah i

2093.119 --> 2098.2000000000003
know

2094.56 --> 2098.2
i get it right

2102.64 --> 2108.48
i mean i don't think anybody

2105.839 --> 2111.599
on the flat earth side even knew who you

2108.48 --> 2112.48
were in 2015

2111.599 --> 2113.599
okay

2112.48 --> 2116.4
tim

2113.599 --> 2118.32
nobody knows who you are if you as an

2116.4 --> 2120.48
anti-flat earther if no flat earther

2118.32 --> 2122.56
knows who you are

2120.48 --> 2124.4
then you are not part of the wave of

2122.56 --> 2126.32
that time

2124.4 --> 2127.599
and that's how it works that's how the

2126.32 --> 2129.2000000000003
waves work

2127.599 --> 2132.6400000000003
you can think that you're part of the

2129.2 --> 2135.359
first wave oh because you were on the

2132.64 --> 2137.5989999999997
internet during that time oh okay well

2135.359 --> 2139.44
nobody knew who the [ __ ] you were this

2137.599 --> 2144.0
is not relevant yeah

2139.44 --> 2145.2000000000003
i was on the internet too in 2015.

2144.0 --> 2147.359
yeah

2145.2 --> 2149.04
doing other things

2147.359 --> 2150.4
that doesn't make me part of the first

2149.04 --> 2151.359
wave

2150.4 --> 2155.7200000000003
yeah

2151.359 --> 2155.72
nobody knew who the [ __ ] i was

2167.92 --> 2172.599
hey matthew hall

2169.44 --> 2172.599
yeah yeah

2181.44 --> 2187.68
is that fake tim oz what

2184.48 --> 2187.68
what faked him oz

2188.24 --> 2192.72
now i know only one tim osman whether

2190.48 --> 2194.72
it's really him or not i don't care it's

2192.72 --> 2197.839
the guy

2194.72 --> 2197.839
that's kind of gay

2198.079 --> 2203.2000000000003
you always make gay remarks about like

2200.4 --> 2205.119
descriptive gay action

2203.2 --> 2208.48
remarks with other people so he is a

2205.119 --> 2210.96
freaking homo i don't give a [ __ ]

2208.48 --> 2213.92
what he thinks about it he is

2210.96 --> 2216.0
and he's the one with the drone footage

2213.92 --> 2218.64
that would say there is no geometric

2216.0 --> 2221.04
horizon as he then says

2218.64 --> 2223.2799999999997
but it that horizon right there is still

2221.04 --> 2224.56
blocking things that's

2223.28 --> 2226.48
tim osman

2224.56 --> 2228.48
he had pretty good drone footage he was

2226.48 --> 2232.16
very active with it he was always saying

2228.48 --> 2235.599
like oh see it's not curvature

2232.16 --> 2237.52
but it's still blocking things

2235.599 --> 2240.76
that's what we know him for on the flat

2237.52 --> 2240.7599999999998
earth debate

2248.24 --> 2254.359
your cat was on the internet in 2015 and

2251.04 --> 2254.359
that's cute

2266.24 --> 2269.24
okay

2280.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
did i break up my girlfriend

2283.28 --> 2285.8390000000004
dude

2286.64 --> 2290.8799999999997
before i did not

2288.88 --> 2293.52
dude i did not have the balls to start a

2290.88 --> 2297.599
youtube channel

2293.52 --> 2297.599
i did not was terrified

2297.76 --> 2305.0400000000004
terrified of being exposed for the

2301.04 --> 2307.599
for the 9 11 denier still

2305.04 --> 2308.8
and for my opinions on obama and all

2307.599 --> 2310.56
that

2308.8 --> 2312.4
right

2310.56 --> 2314.64
12 to

2312.4 --> 2314.64
yeah

2314.8 --> 2319.6800000000003
12 to 16.

2316.4 --> 2323.28
and before no it was like

2319.68 --> 2323.2799999999997
2008 to 16.

2323.599 --> 2326.079
damn

2324.56 --> 2328.32
freaking eight years yeah i was

2326.079 --> 2330.6400000000003
terrified and i wasn't doing a youtube

2328.32 --> 2330.6400000000003
channel

2331.76 --> 2335.2000000000003
no it's really

2333.359 --> 2337.04
a flat earth that kind of made me like

2335.2 --> 2338.96
okay i'm gonna do it now even if it's

2337.04 --> 2341.2799999999997
gonna get me killed i'm just gonna do it

2338.96 --> 2344.48
i don't care anymore

2341.28 --> 2348.6800000000003
and that was 2016

2344.48 --> 2348.68
when i eventually did it

2366.56 --> 2374.0
what cult culti belief system tim osman

2370.48 --> 2377.119
why don't you stop slandering us

2374.0 --> 2379.68
with these catch phrases and unless you

2377.119 --> 2384.8
would like to back that up

2379.68 --> 2384.7999999999997
like with persistent specifics yeah

2385.28 --> 2390.96
what you're using imply very specific

2388.24 --> 2396.52
things so why don't you back that up and

2390.96 --> 2396.52
stop over generalizing and harming us

2397.92 --> 2402.2400000000002
yeah

2398.88 --> 2403.52
i mean i can do that with you

2402.24 --> 2406.56
because

2403.52 --> 2408.079
i can then immediately proceed to point

2406.56 --> 2411.839
out

2408.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
an entire list of why

2412.079 --> 2416.4
so

2413.92 --> 2417.6800000000003
you do you should be doing the same

2416.4 --> 2420.079
just

2417.68 --> 2423.64
baseless at homes

2420.079 --> 2423.6400000000003
they're kind of tiresome

2426.0 --> 2430.96
you seven years of observations yeah

2428.24 --> 2432.7999999999997
yeah observations of what

2430.96 --> 2436.0
of earth curve

2432.8 --> 2436.0
that's not geometric

2436.079 --> 2439.6400000000003
it's just optical

2440.319 --> 2443.319
huh

2474.0 --> 2478.4
observing flat earthers

2476.56 --> 2481.04
thought that was evidence oh yeah well

2478.4 --> 2483.52
i've observed flat earthers too

2481.04 --> 2484.56
and ballers and anti-flat earthers and

2483.52 --> 2486.88
all of it

2484.56 --> 2489.44
and people in politics

2486.88 --> 2489.44
and people

2489.599 --> 2495.839
in the general public yeah

2492.8 --> 2495.8390000000004
serve all of it

2503.28 --> 2508.079
yeah i don't see any over

2505.16 --> 2511.04
generalizations though

2508.079 --> 2514.2400000000002
i mean our arguments are

2511.04 --> 2517.04
not as over generalized

2514.24 --> 2521.4399999999996
right compared to for example

2517.04 --> 2522.4
at homes towards our character traits

2521.44 --> 2524.8
right

2522.4 --> 2525.839
or assumptions about our background

2524.8 --> 2528.4
which

2525.839 --> 2534.359
anti-flat earth is like yourself

2528.4 --> 2534.359
indulge in just all too easily yeah

2538.48 --> 2544.72
so yeah projection projection is the

2541.839 --> 2547.599
number one anti-flat earther trait

2544.72 --> 2549.4399999999996
it's also the number one new world order

2547.599 --> 2551.44
politician

2549.44 --> 2552.88
by accident

2551.44 --> 2556.359
coincidence

2552.88 --> 2556.359
or is it

2564.079 --> 2567.3590000000004
yeah so

2565.92 --> 2569.76
keep on

2567.359 --> 2572.0789999999997
projecting your [ __ ] you know

2569.76 --> 2574.88
what else can you do but yeah it's not

2572.079 --> 2577.119
gonna help anything because we know

2574.88 --> 2580.6400000000003
that the intellectual wars

2577.119 --> 2583.6800000000003
flat earth versus globe have been one on

2580.64 --> 2587.2799999999997
every conceivable front

2583.68 --> 2589.359
every conceivable front

2587.28 --> 2590.8390000000004
psychological

2589.359 --> 2594.96
physical

2590.839 --> 2594.96
mathematical philosophical

2595.04 --> 2601.839
all of it

2596.4 --> 2605.52
we've won every conceivable aspect

2601.839 --> 2608.56
yeah we've won all of it the war is one

2605.52 --> 2612.56
you have absolutely nothing left

2608.56 --> 2612.56
but projection and double speak

2613.2 --> 2617.4399999999996
to prevent yourself from letting it sink

2616.4 --> 2619.76
in

2617.44 --> 2623.839
that you've absolutely

2619.76 --> 2625.6800000000003
absolutely irrevocably lost the war

2623.839 --> 2630.0789999999997
you've lost it

2625.68 --> 2632.16
there will be no opportunity to win

2630.079 --> 2635.119
it ever again

2632.16 --> 2639.2
because what has been done has been done

2635.119 --> 2639.2000000000003
what has been won has been one

2647.44 --> 2652.4
no cana bear this is the guy

2650.0 --> 2655.44
yeah it's his sock whatever but it is

2652.4 --> 2658.8
the guy i recognize it

2655.44 --> 2661.119
tim osman has a very specific way of of

2658.8 --> 2664.7200000000003
saying things it is him it's not

2661.119 --> 2664.7200000000003
somebody pretending to be him

2674.16 --> 2677.92
effie is growing daily

2676.72 --> 2678.7999999999997
yeah

2677.92 --> 2681.44
sure

2678.8 --> 2683.599
but that's not the point though goalie

2681.44 --> 2686.079
yeah doesn't matter whether fe is

2683.599 --> 2688.8
growing or not yeah that's about

2686.079 --> 2691.52
popularity that's about oh where are

2688.8 --> 2693.3590000000004
people what are they busying themselves

2691.52 --> 2695.599
with you know are they still afraid of

2693.359 --> 2696.56
flat earth or do they like to look into

2695.599 --> 2699.28
it

2696.56 --> 2700.7999999999997
like to dig through it you know

2699.28 --> 2702.4
that's something else

2700.8 --> 2705.119
i'm talking specific i'm not talking

2702.4 --> 2708.8
about popularity i'm talking about

2705.119 --> 2710.48
the intellectual war the arguments

2708.8 --> 2712.7200000000003
the mechanics

2710.48 --> 2715.28
yeah the actual argument flat earth

2712.72 --> 2716.7999999999997
versus globe we won that a hundred

2715.28 --> 2719.52
percent doesn't really matter how

2716.8 --> 2721.76
popular flat earth is

2719.52 --> 2723.839
i mean it's got to be popular at one

2721.76 --> 2725.92
moment and then less popular in another

2723.839 --> 2727.44
it doesn't really matter because the war

2725.92 --> 2730.079
is one

2727.44 --> 2732.4
this is all basically museum work at

2730.079 --> 2736.0
this point we're just like

2732.4 --> 2738.079
representing how we won the war

2736.0 --> 2739.839
yeah that's what we're now doing that's

2738.079 --> 2741.2000000000003
what the flat earth debate in their own

2739.839 --> 2743.52
right is doing and we're still

2741.2 --> 2745.359
struggling psychologically

2743.52 --> 2746.88
right we won the war but there's plenty

2745.359 --> 2749.2799999999997
of

2746.88 --> 2751.599
not houses around that need to be filled

2749.28 --> 2753.8390000000004
with people that have severe

2751.599 --> 2756.2400000000002
post-traumatic syndrome

2753.839 --> 2758.88
post-traumatic stress syndrome for from

2756.24 --> 2761.2799999999997
losing that war

2758.88 --> 2763.92
and we still deal with them right but

2761.28 --> 2765.92
the war has been won the rest is just a

2763.92 --> 2767.119
museum piece

2765.92 --> 2768.96
that's what it is that's what we're

2767.119 --> 2772.319
doing right now we're just showing you

2768.96 --> 2776.2400000000002
how we won the war because we did we can

2772.319 --> 2776.24
prove it every single detail

2776.96 --> 2779.52
yeah

2778.0 --> 2783.599
so it's just

2779.52 --> 2783.599
an exposition piece at this point

2784.4 --> 2789.6800000000003
a piece of history like a like a public

2788.319 --> 2793.7599999999998
life

2789.68 --> 2796.24
enacted museum of how we won the war how

2793.76 --> 2799.6400000000003
flat earthers won

2796.24 --> 2799.64
over the globe

2805.119 --> 2808.119
huh

2828.0 --> 2832.24
how does fe

2829.68 --> 2835.7599999999998
winning the war impact reality

2832.24 --> 2838.8799999999997
well it gives us a chance to purge the

2835.76 --> 2840.559
rest of the double thinking lies

2838.88 --> 2843.52
yeah

2840.559 --> 2846.96
which plagues this society

2843.52 --> 2850.4
because the entire society is heavily

2846.96 --> 2851.2
plagued right now by a demonic spirit

2850.4 --> 2853.839
of

2851.2 --> 2856.48
straight out double thinking doubling

2853.839 --> 2857.7599999999998
down lying

2856.48 --> 2861.839
and

2857.76 --> 2864.48
psycho psychopathic mercilessness

2861.839 --> 2865.599
towards those who get in your way

2864.48 --> 2869.52
kind of like

2865.599 --> 2870.319
what we associate with nazis right

2869.52 --> 2872.72
yeah

2870.319 --> 2874.8
that's the problem lies double think

2872.72 --> 2877.4399999999996
yeah well winning

2874.8 --> 2881.76
the intellectual war with flat earth

2877.44 --> 2885.04
gives us a permanent beachhead

2881.76 --> 2887.119
it's proof it's irrevocable proof right

2885.04 --> 2890.24
there that part

2887.119 --> 2892.8
of what is grafted into their dream

2890.24 --> 2895.68
narrative double thing dream narrative

2892.8 --> 2899.6800000000003
that a part of it a very foundational

2895.68 --> 2903.44
part is 100 percent proven to be a lie

2899.68 --> 2903.44
that gives us a beach head

2904.24 --> 2908.72
right

2905.359 --> 2912.24
in the psych in the overall overarching

2908.72 --> 2913.52
worldwide psychological war

2912.24 --> 2917.52
against

2913.52 --> 2917.52
the double think empire

2917.599 --> 2922.559
gives us a beachhead

2920.079 --> 2924.559
a beachhead that can't be taken

2922.559 --> 2927.52
i mean they could nuke it

2924.559 --> 2930.2400000000002
right god forbid it and do do all kinds

2927.52 --> 2933.44
of horrible evil things

2930.24 --> 2933.4399999999996
they're not doing it though

2934.319 --> 2940.079
it would probably just

2936.88 --> 2943.28
make yeah be cataclysmic they did that

2940.079 --> 2946.2400000000002
so they're just leaving it but yeah the

2943.28 --> 2949.0400000000004
debate the real intellectual war there

2946.24 --> 2951.4399999999996
it has been won we won it's a beach hat

2949.04 --> 2954.839
now it's ours they're not gonna try to

2951.44 --> 2956.8
retake it not really they're just trying

2954.839 --> 2958.0789999999997
to like

2956.8 --> 2960.319
uh

2958.079 --> 2962.559
corners in

2960.319 --> 2965.359
by surrounding us by

2962.559 --> 2968.28
insane double speaking anti-flat earther

2965.359 --> 2971.2
numpties the kind of snow was under

2968.28 --> 2974.0
encapsulate us under giant layers of

2971.2 --> 2977.359
willing lies and disgusting

2974.0 --> 2979.359
like spiritually puking demons

2977.359 --> 2981.52
yeah that's their strategy now but they

2979.359 --> 2984.4
can't retake the beach they can only

2981.52 --> 2986.079
basically build a wall around it a wall

2984.4 --> 2988.4
of discouragement and that's all they're

2986.079 --> 2990.96
doing now they're pretty good at it too

2988.4 --> 2992.64
you know they got a lot of really [ __ ]

2990.96 --> 2994.64
up demonic people

2992.64 --> 2997.2
to do that

2994.64 --> 2999.44
and to even lose themselves in doing

2997.2 --> 3002.319
that

2999.44 --> 3003.76
they lose themselves in they become the

3002.319 --> 3006.48
wall

3003.76 --> 3010.5200000000004
anti-flat earthers they literally lose

3006.48 --> 3010.52
themselves in the process

3013.44 --> 3017.119
because

3014.64 --> 3019.68
once you become an anti-flat earther you

3017.119 --> 3021.76
don't really have anything left after

3019.68 --> 3023.7599999999998
that point right so they like to say

3021.76 --> 3027.0400000000004
that oh once you go into flat earth it's

3023.76 --> 3029.599
a disaster oh no you get fired and

3027.04 --> 3030.88
you're crazy everybody hates you yeah

3029.599 --> 3033.04
yeah

3030.88 --> 3035.599
guess what

3033.04 --> 3036.8
that was kind of a projection too

3035.599 --> 3038.88
you see

3036.8 --> 3042.48
once you really become an anti-flat

3038.88 --> 3044.2400000000002
earther that indulges in lying in plain

3042.48 --> 3045.599
sight for all to see except for

3044.24 --> 3048.0789999999997
themselves

3045.599 --> 3051.2000000000003
that's when they

3048.079 --> 3054.7200000000003
really truly get exercised

3051.2 --> 3057.9199999999996
from the more social society because

3054.72 --> 3060.0
people hate liars

3057.92 --> 3061.599
and they hate them more as time

3060.0 --> 3064.0
progresses and it's getting worse you

3061.599 --> 3065.28
know politics is getting worse at the

3064.0 --> 3067.359
lies

3065.28 --> 3070.96
people are building

3067.359 --> 3075.44
more and more intolerance against liars

3070.96 --> 3075.44
so if you then choose to live

3075.599 --> 3081.04
as being part of that wall

3078.319 --> 3084.0
to fend off a flat earth

3081.04 --> 3087.52
and being a wall of lies yeah people are

3084.0 --> 3090.4
gonna freaking hate you more and more

3087.52 --> 3092.559
naturally you don't have to tell them

3090.4 --> 3095.359
even what you do that much

3092.559 --> 3097.6800000000003
it will just radiate off you like this

3095.359 --> 3099.68
is a double speaking liar he is like a

3097.68 --> 3104.7599999999998
politician

3099.68 --> 3104.7599999999998
and they will not like you for that

3122.839 --> 3128.0
yeah what that fellow what are you

3125.52 --> 3128.0
talking about

3130.96 --> 3135.2
i've

3131.68 --> 3136.24
had a vote flat earth in school huh

3135.2 --> 3138.8799999999997
all right

3136.24 --> 3140.64
that's cool

3138.88 --> 3143.6800000000003
well you know

3140.64 --> 3145.92
if i had to meddle with any of that i'd

3143.68 --> 3146.72
say

3145.92 --> 3149.6800000000003
don't

3146.72 --> 3151.4399999999996
like oh well do or don't

3149.68 --> 3154.0789999999997
i don't think it's necessary to like

3151.44 --> 3156.7200000000003
standardize a flat earth curriculum

3154.079 --> 3158.8
right it's problematic you see

3156.72 --> 3161.2
we don't exactly know

3158.8 --> 3162.8
other than the geometric orientation of

3161.2 --> 3165.52
the earth's surface

3162.8 --> 3166.88
what the earth is completely other than

3165.52 --> 3168.8
flat

3166.88 --> 3170.96
so it's kind of problematic to build a

3168.8 --> 3172.2400000000002
curriculum for that

3170.96 --> 3174.7200000000003
but

3172.24 --> 3177.5989999999997
if you want to go in that direction then

3174.72 --> 3178.7999999999997
start off by not

3177.599 --> 3181.839
shaming

3178.8 --> 3181.8390000000004
flat earth anymore

3182.24 --> 3185.52
just don't

3184.0 --> 3187.76
shame condition

3185.52 --> 3189.68
right don't go like how dare you flat

3187.76 --> 3192.0
earth for stupid people

3189.68 --> 3192.96
don't do that anymore

3192.0 --> 3194.96
and

3192.96 --> 3197.28
yeah if then

3194.96 --> 3200.48
it is basically

3197.28 --> 3201.599
no no longer a taboo to talk about it

3200.48 --> 3204.2400000000002
then

3201.599 --> 3207.04
yeah kids and whatever students can work

3204.24 --> 3208.7999999999997
it out for themselves right just don't

3207.04 --> 3212.0
shame it anymore

3208.8 --> 3215.52
let them just figure it out

3212.0 --> 3215.52
that would be my advice

3220.64 --> 3227.4
don't you go on nathan oakley's wearing

3223.68 --> 3229.2
fatter they're streaming globbers

3227.4 --> 3233.119
incorrectly

3229.2 --> 3233.1189999999997
no they're not incorrect at all

3233.28 --> 3240.0
that's projection again no you are wrong

3236.24 --> 3243.839
your arguments are stupid and wrong

3240.0 --> 3247.52
and like blatantly broken

3243.839 --> 3251.359
like the very foundations of mathematics

3247.52 --> 3252.48
and geometry you break this in your mind

3251.359 --> 3253.359
just to

3252.48 --> 3255.52
think

3253.359 --> 3258.16
like there's still something left to win

3255.52 --> 3259.68
in an argument it's absolutely

3258.16 --> 3261.5989999999997
preposterous

3259.68 --> 3262.64
and pathetic

3261.599 --> 3266.1600000000003
yeah

3262.64 --> 3267.7599999999998
so stop projecting

3266.16 --> 3271.2
your in

3267.76 --> 3273.119
eternal losing

3271.2 --> 3275.7599999999998
yeah

3273.119 --> 3278.4
you've lost you have no arguments

3275.76 --> 3281.76
everything you're still holding on to is

3278.4 --> 3285.599
wrong and it's there it's a lie in your

3281.76 --> 3288.2400000000002
face just so you can think for a moment

3285.599 --> 3290.6400000000003
nostalgic delusion

3288.24 --> 3293.2
like you've actually won an argument or

3290.64 --> 3294.4
that you could win an intellectual

3293.2 --> 3298.16
argument

3294.4 --> 3299.839
from your vantage point you can't

3298.16 --> 3302.48
it's over

3299.839 --> 3303.44
you hear me tim osman it's over you've

3302.48 --> 3306.4
lost

3303.44 --> 3308.88
there is no more maneuvering room

3306.4 --> 3312.7200000000003
to win an argument from your vantage

3308.88 --> 3313.92
point there's no more possibility zero

3312.72 --> 3316.319
percent

3313.92 --> 3319.799
zero

3316.319 --> 3319.799
not 0.0001

3323.599 --> 3328.96
there is no more winning

3326.24 --> 3330.799
from your vantage point

3328.96 --> 3335.64
give it up

3330.799 --> 3335.64
you're just wasting your time and energy

3337.68 --> 3341.48
ha i got a khalsa

3371.2 --> 3377.5589999999997
flat earth is now just

3373.359 --> 3377.5589999999997
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

3380.88 --> 3385.559
or w what does that even mean

3391.44 --> 3394.44
uh

3417.599 --> 3419.839
um

3425.599 --> 3430.079
oh

3426.88 --> 3431.6800000000003
right canada bear sure

3430.079 --> 3433.3590000000004
well there has been there have been

3431.68 --> 3436.3999999999996
socks

3433.359 --> 3438.48
pretending to be me going around

3436.4 --> 3440.64
especially the ones that are like oh i

3438.48 --> 3440.64
do

3440.96 --> 3444.4
yeah yeah

3442.64 --> 3447.7599999999998
they've been around

3444.4 --> 3448.7200000000003
it's just that i'm quite well known by

3447.76 --> 3451.28
now

3448.72 --> 3453.839
for how i work

3451.28 --> 3457.2000000000003
on pretty much every front

3453.839 --> 3458.799
so people can't be fooled by that right

3457.2 --> 3460.3999999999996
when i show up

3458.799 --> 3462.72
in a chat somewhere

3460.4 --> 3464.48
people just immediately know if it's me

3462.72 --> 3468.64
or not why

3464.48 --> 3472.48
because of a very specific energy

3468.64 --> 3476.5589999999997
frequency trait that is arwen and other

3472.48 --> 3480.0
people can't mimic it you understand

3476.559 --> 3483.599
people can't mimic me i'm too

3480.0 --> 3483.599
complicated to mimic

3484.559 --> 3488.96
they can't do it

3486.559 --> 3490.079
literally

3488.96 --> 3491.28
so

3490.079 --> 3493.2000000000003
yeah

3491.28 --> 3495.2000000000003
i don't i'm not worried about people

3493.2 --> 3497.9199999999996
pretending to be me

3495.2 --> 3500.8799999999997
it doesn't work everybody

3497.92 --> 3505.2000000000003
understands me by now to to a degree

3500.88 --> 3505.2000000000003
where they will know when it's not me

3505.28 --> 3510.0
based on what i do what i don't do

3512.48 --> 3516.559
because on earth tastes good oh yeah

3514.72 --> 3519.5589999999997
better believe it

3516.559 --> 3519.559
hmm

3546.72 --> 3549.839
yeah let me get some tea

3550.079 --> 3554.88
yeah finally stop finally losing like

3552.88 --> 3558.44
the nausea

3554.88 --> 3558.44
my damn time

3584.0 --> 3588.24
okay thanks for that steamy traveler i

3586.16 --> 3590.5589999999997
was talking about activity in chat

3588.24 --> 3590.5589999999997
though

3596.88 --> 3601.119
and my voice

3598.4 --> 3603.839
does anybody know somebody that

3601.119 --> 3607.599
has typically my voice

3603.839 --> 3610.4
my inflections my weird dutch pauses and

3607.599 --> 3610.4
all that no

3610.88 --> 3615.839
i've never heard anybody where i thought

3613.04 --> 3618.839
like whoa is that me

3615.839 --> 3618.839
never

3636.0 --> 3639.0
um

3642.0 --> 3647.359
i almost forgot

3644.0 --> 3649.44
i watched the movie yesterday

3647.359 --> 3652.61
and it was great

3649.44 --> 3655.649
it was highly enjoyable

3652.61 --> 3655.6490000000003
[Music]

3656.24 --> 3660.9599999999996
i call einstein

3658.0 --> 3660.96
einstein

3665.599 --> 3671.6400000000003
yeah

3666.64 --> 3671.64
i say it in the german way

3674.0 --> 3677.68
because

3674.96 --> 3679.839
einstein just sounds

3677.68 --> 3682.24
like a dumb american trying to say a

3679.839 --> 3683.7599999999998
german name to me

3682.24 --> 3686.3999999999996
yeah

3683.76 --> 3688.2400000000002
no offense to americans

3686.4 --> 3692.1600000000003
but that's exactly what that sounds to

3688.24 --> 3694.799
me like so i just i say names or i try

3692.16 --> 3694.799
to say them

3694.88 --> 3700.079
in the original language style

3698.559 --> 3703.2000000000003
i just do that

3700.079 --> 3703.2000000000003
it's an arwyn thing

3703.44 --> 3709.119
so i say einstein

3706.64 --> 3710.0789999999997
it's perfectly natural that's

3709.119 --> 3714.88
how

3710.079 --> 3714.88
he would have heard people say his name

3722.72 --> 3726.5589999999997
right one of the few names i actually

3724.88 --> 3728.6400000000003
don't do that with

3726.559 --> 3731.599
is my own

3728.64 --> 3735.2799999999997
because i'm not expecting people to say

3731.599 --> 3738.1600000000003
arvane or arvain

3735.28 --> 3740.96
i'm not expecting people like hey say it

3738.16 --> 3744.48
the right way right now say my name the

3740.96 --> 3744.48
right way because that's just like

3747.2 --> 3752.3999999999996
you're gonna have a whole like a whole

3748.559 --> 3752.4
row of people like everyone

3752.799 --> 3758.72
no just

3754.48 --> 3758.72
just call me arwyn it's all right

3762.4 --> 3767.2000000000003
oh yeah the film that i watched

3764.72 --> 3769.5989999999997
yeah uh darkest hour

3767.2 --> 3772.319
supposed historical piece about a

3769.599 --> 3772.319
churchio

3772.64 --> 3776.8799999999997
and it was really fascinating

3780.4 --> 3787.44
i had never seen it before and it was

3783.28 --> 3790.48
very rich in character and i think that

3787.44 --> 3791.52
the person acting churchill like

3790.48 --> 3795.88
did

3791.52 --> 3795.88
super deep immersion

3796.48 --> 3802.2400000000002
it was extremely convincing

3799.52 --> 3804.799
and i really liked the character i i

3802.24 --> 3808.319
thought he was fascinating as a as a man

3804.799 --> 3810.799
as he was represented probably like

3808.319 --> 3813.0389999999998
i don't know how absolutely accurate it

3810.799 --> 3815.0389999999998
was

3813.039 --> 3817.76
but

3815.039 --> 3819.2000000000003
i really sympathize with him and i even

3817.76 --> 3820.96
felt like yeah

3819.2 --> 3822.96
it was mentioned at some point like yeah

3820.96 --> 3825.52
i am unpredictable

3822.96 --> 3828.319
that's why i'm being appointed this role

3825.52 --> 3830.799
and i'm like [ __ ] yeah

3828.319 --> 3834.5589999999997
that could be me

3830.799 --> 3836.839
i am i am like that i really freaking

3834.559 --> 3838.96
resonate with that guy how he's

3836.839 --> 3841.599
presented how he's presented in the

3838.96 --> 3844.079
movie i'm like [ __ ] yeah that guy is a

3841.599 --> 3845.28
freaking legend man

3844.079 --> 3847.039
i don't know if he would have been

3845.28 --> 3848.559
exactly like that in the real world

3847.039 --> 3849.76
probably a little bit

3848.559 --> 3851.3590000000004
colder

3849.76 --> 3854.079
maybe

3851.359 --> 3856.64
called more cold-hearted

3854.079 --> 3858.48
war criminal yeah sure fine yeah yeah i

3856.64 --> 3861.2
get it yeah

3858.48 --> 3864.72
i'm don't do that don't [ __ ] make it

3861.2 --> 3868.5589999999997
political immediately right

3864.72 --> 3868.5589999999997
you always have to freaking do that

3871.119 --> 3876.079
i thought

3872.16 --> 3878.64
it was a really interesting movie

3876.079 --> 3881.6400000000003
he was a big baby

3878.64 --> 3881.64
uh

3882.4 --> 3886.4
he had a big ego

3885.119 --> 3889.28
he had

3886.4 --> 3892.319
insane levels of responsibility that

3889.28 --> 3894.48
literally make people shiver

3892.319 --> 3896.799
and he could handle that because of his

3894.48 --> 3900.559
freaking big ego

3896.799 --> 3900.559
when everybody was just trembling

3901.119 --> 3904.48
no

3902.079 --> 3906.559
he was made for that for what he was

3904.48 --> 3909.039
assigned to do

3906.559 --> 3911.52
and everybody was against him and i

3909.039 --> 3911.5200000000004
think that

3911.839 --> 3918.72
he really did the best he could

3916.24 --> 3920.799
i really do i don't know maybe the movie

3918.72 --> 3924.8799999999997
was propaganda and it worked on me i

3920.799 --> 3924.88
don't know i was just really sympathetic

3928.0 --> 3933.28
churchill was a massive piece of [ __ ]

3931.2 --> 3935.4399999999996
squirt for me everybody

3933.28 --> 3937.3590000000004
everybody hate him hate him tell me how

3935.44 --> 3940.7200000000003
much he is hitler

3937.359 --> 3940.72
tell me how evil he is

3945.839 --> 3950.24
of course

3948.0 --> 3952.559
of course he was secretly this and

3950.24 --> 3955.0389999999998
secretly that and he hated people and he

3952.559 --> 3957.599
was a sadist and he probably tortured

3955.039 --> 3957.599
killed him too

3958.319 --> 3963.44
yeah yeah go ahead yeah

3961.52 --> 3966.799
barf it all out

3963.44 --> 3968.319
puke on it puke on it go ahead puke puke

3966.799 --> 3970.079
all over it

3968.319 --> 3976.2799999999997
puke your

3970.079 --> 3976.28
dark garbage over it why don't you

3998.4 --> 4003.52
i really liked the movie

4001.119 --> 4003.52
i did

4003.599 --> 4008.88
and i am a fan of churchill

4007.119 --> 4010.0
and i am a fan

4008.88 --> 4013.92
of

4010.0 --> 4013.92
his delusion in a way

4014.64 --> 4017.2
because

4016.4 --> 4021.839
he

4017.2 --> 4021.839
was just operating on another level

4022.799 --> 4027.64
and there was nobody else doing that

4037.119 --> 4040.48
was he a crypto jeep

4041.2 --> 4043.9199999999996
i don't know

4047.359 --> 4050.799
dude

4048.48 --> 4054.16
at this point i don't give a [ __ ] if he

4050.799 --> 4055.119
was the [ __ ] antichrist i like him

4054.16 --> 4056.64
okay

4055.119 --> 4061.359
deal with it

4056.64 --> 4065.72
deal with it i like churchill

4061.359 --> 4065.72
get the [ __ ] over it

4099.04 --> 4105.5199999999995
yeah yeah and indeed yeah

4102.159 --> 4108.879999999999
yeah people do get prison time prison

4105.52 --> 4111.4400000000005
time for telling the truth yeah

4108.88 --> 4115.4400000000005
and that is justified you know why

4111.44 --> 4117.759
because it's [ __ ] war it's war

4115.44 --> 4119.5199999999995
and sometimes telling the truth oh

4117.759 --> 4122.0
because they have to do

4119.52 --> 4123.279
yeah is a giant

4122.0 --> 4125.679
human

4123.279 --> 4127.679
slaying disaster

4125.679 --> 4130.56
that's why

4127.679 --> 4133.4400000000005
that is why i say yes

4130.56 --> 4136.2390000000005
[ __ ] david irwin he deserved the [ __ ]

4133.44 --> 4139.759
prison for telling the truth

4136.239 --> 4139.759
in a freaking time of war

4140.319 --> 4144.359
i assume that's what happened

4159.839 --> 4163.44
yes minister i remember that

4163.679 --> 4168.4
i remember yes minister being extremely

4166.0 --> 4168.4
witty

4171.04 --> 4177.359
he's a historian after the fact

4175.04 --> 4177.359
fine

4185.92 --> 4191.1990000000005
right so what to do what

4188.56 --> 4193.4400000000005
so irving what was his point that

4191.199 --> 4195.44
churchill should rot in prison the rest

4193.44 --> 4197.36
of his life

4195.44 --> 4199.759999999999
was that the thing that he was trying to

4197.36 --> 4201.679
accomplish with that it's just like yeah

4199.76 --> 4204.56
look this man is some really [ __ ] up

4201.679 --> 4205.76
things that he does sometimes

4204.56 --> 4208.159000000001
so yeah

4205.76 --> 4209.4400000000005
who cares if he helped us won this

4208.159 --> 4210.879999999999
freaking war

4209.44 --> 4216.199
we're just gonna

4210.88 --> 4216.1990000000005
lay a massive dump on him now

4217.199 --> 4222.799999999999
make him pay

4220.0 --> 4225.6
the victory he gave us by absolutely

4222.8 --> 4225.6
burying him

4225.92 --> 4229.719
think that's a good thing

4248.719 --> 4253.84
you like the pencils i don't care i

4250.88 --> 4253.84
don't give a [ __ ]

4253.92 --> 4259.04
i like churchill i don't care i don't

4256.4 --> 4261.12
care if he was freaking hitler's twin

4259.04 --> 4263.679
brother i don't care if he was hitler's

4261.12 --> 4264.5599999999995
father i don't give a [ __ ]

4263.679 --> 4265.92
what

4264.56 --> 4269.4800000000005
he did

4265.92 --> 4269.4800000000005
i like him

4303.199 --> 4308.799999999999
yeah i know yes

4305.84 --> 4311.84
he got coventry bombed that's right

4308.8 --> 4313.52
and he sent like 6 000 soldiers to their

4311.84 --> 4316.8
deaths

4313.52 --> 4319.92
just to give cover for a retreat yeah

4316.8 --> 4323.04
all kinds of terrible terrible things

4319.92 --> 4325.92
that happen in war

4323.04 --> 4327.76
yeah because he was a war president

4325.92 --> 4332.08
he was literally

4327.76 --> 4334.96
elected to be a war president

4332.08 --> 4337.28
and that's what you end up with

4334.96 --> 4340.0
terrible things happen in war

4337.28 --> 4342.48
information is critical

4340.0 --> 4345.52
and sacrifices have to be made

4342.48 --> 4348.48
that are very very bitter tasting for a

4345.52 --> 4348.4800000000005
very long time

4351.92 --> 4358.2390000000005
so i'm not going to be a universal

4355.44 --> 4362.879999999999
social justice warrior wanker and point

4358.239 --> 4362.879999999999
him in he's a bad man he's a bad man

4362.96 --> 4366.719
he's a [ __ ] war president what the

4364.8 --> 4369.1990000000005
hell do you expect

4366.719 --> 4371.84
he did his best he freaking won that war

4369.199 --> 4373.5199999999995
okay

4371.84 --> 4375.4400000000005
and

4373.52 --> 4379.4800000000005
yeah

4375.44 --> 4379.48
kind of got lucky with that

4394.64 --> 4398.8
yeah that's right ward doesn't have

4396.32 --> 4402.719
winners not really

4398.8 --> 4403.679
but hey we're not living in

4402.719 --> 4408.159
like

4403.679 --> 4408.159
germania europe right now

4418.239 --> 4422.239
look i'm not even saying that he was

4420.0 --> 4424.159
some kind of supposed military genius i

4422.239 --> 4428.08
don't think so

4424.159 --> 4429.599999999999
but at least he had the freaking balls

4428.08 --> 4432.08
to just do

4429.6 --> 4434.400000000001
what like everybody was all washed out

4432.08 --> 4434.4
to do

4435.36 --> 4441.36
he was like a war bell he woke

4438.159 --> 4444.0
people up for real when they were all

4441.36 --> 4447.36
just like oh no

4444.0 --> 4450.4

nobody gives a [ __ ]

4475.92 --> 4478.2390000000005

4541.28 --> 4545.0
right classical homeopath

4559.199 --> 4562.199
uh

you never watched

4573.199 --> 4578.08
me neither

4575.28 --> 4578.08
it doesn't matter

4579.28 --> 4582.239
it is what it is

4585.44 --> 4591.28
yeah savannah you can't handle my truth

4589.52 --> 4595.080000000001
i'm special boy

4591.28 --> 4595.08
everybody's evil

4636.08 --> 4638.719
huh

4636.96 --> 4642.0
yeah yeah you have gas head that's what

4638.719 --> 4642.0
everybody forgets

4644.159 --> 4647.44
they just

4645.199 --> 4651.28
yeah

4647.44 --> 4651.28
what does savage

4661.84 --> 4664.56
what does it mean

4663.12 --> 4668.5599999999995
it's

4664.56 --> 4669.92
a weird random reference pretty much

4668.56 --> 4672.88
to like

4669.92 --> 4676.0
as a behavioral sense of vanier is a

4672.88 --> 4677.4400000000005
subset of gamma behavior

4676.0 --> 4679.199
it's where people

4677.44 --> 4682.799999999999
will end up with

4679.199 --> 4685.759999999999
when they basically go conspiratored

4682.8 --> 4688.320000000001
and then think that they are smart and

4685.76 --> 4690.2390000000005
like are smarter than everybody else and

4688.32 --> 4694.08
they think that everything is fake it's

4690.239 --> 4696.239
pretty much like all gauges on max

4694.08 --> 4699.64
so it becomes completely ridiculous and

4696.239 --> 4699.639999999999
that's savagne

4710.64 --> 4714.719
yoga pants being a

4712.4 --> 4718.159
fe guru yeah yeah

4714.719 --> 4720.96
that's one way to describe it

4718.159 --> 4723.28
but technically savannah is not

4720.96 --> 4725.76
exclusively about flat earth it could be

4723.28 --> 4725.759999999999
anything

4727.52 --> 4734.88
it's the attitude it's not the subject

4732.0 --> 4738.36
hey woodworking gunny bear

4734.88 --> 4738.36
good to see you

4760.64 --> 4763.64
um

4779.199 --> 4783.199
are you talking to me logical conclusion

4786.88 --> 4791.92
i

4787.84 --> 4795.76
am always saying i'm right

4791.92 --> 4798.08
well when i'm right i say i'm right yeah

4795.76 --> 4800.719
i'm not always right i mean i think i'm

4798.08 --> 4802.84
always right until i figure out that i

4800.719 --> 4806.159
wasn't and then i'll correct

4802.84 --> 4809.04
myself so i'm always right except when

4806.159 --> 4812.159
i'm not right and then i quickly correct

4809.04 --> 4814.159
that so that i'm always right again

4812.159 --> 4815.679
yeah

4814.159 --> 4819.839999999999
yeah that's not what sylvania does

4815.679 --> 4819.84
sophany never admits when he's wrong

4826.159 --> 4831.08
he'll just make up an excuse and move on

4833.92 --> 4838.88
a late start today no

4836.48 --> 4840.718999999999
no it's not

4838.88 --> 4843.04
but there is like an hour difference

4840.719 --> 4844.56
between europe and america right now i

4843.04 --> 4847.84
know you i hope you realize that

4844.56 --> 4847.84
woodworking gunny bear

4851.04 --> 4854.8
so for me right now it's

4854.88 --> 4860.04
10

4855.679 --> 4860.04
past half three

4860.159 --> 4863.719
amsterdam time

4892.88 --> 4897.12
listen to what actually happened in

4894.48 --> 4900.159
world yeah i think i heard that story

4897.12 --> 4903.04
andy hold my beer

4900.159 --> 4905.599999999999
yeah

4903.04 --> 4908.239
there was probably and i know churchill

4905.6 --> 4911.280000000001
was freemason he was like hyper

4908.239 --> 4914.32
connected he was kind of like a weird

4911.28 --> 4916.08
trump type figure of his time but not

4914.32 --> 4920.0
like trump but he was like super

4916.08 --> 4921.04
connected he had massive influence

4920.0 --> 4922.719
right

4921.04 --> 4925.76
a higher is up

4922.719 --> 4928.719
yeah and there was of course

4925.76 --> 4931.679
annoying manipulation and [ __ ] going on

4928.719 --> 4934.08
there's no preventing that

4931.679 --> 4935.679
it's like oh how well did that work out

4934.08 --> 4936.5599999999995
with freaking trump

4935.679 --> 4941.04
yeah

4936.56 --> 4942.719
yeah because you can't prevent that

4941.04 --> 4947.6
ever

4942.719 --> 4947.6
you can never stop that don't you get it

4947.92 --> 4955.36
stop projecting your flawless ideal

4951.76 --> 4958.639
situations on the world it never works

4955.36 --> 4959.759999999999
that never happens ever

4958.639 --> 4961.6
ever

4959.76 --> 4965.76
stop it

4961.6 --> 4968.08
yeah i don't care i don't care

4965.76 --> 4970.159000000001
he was a freaking freemason i don't care

4968.08 --> 4972.8
he had sneaky [ __ ]

4970.159 --> 4975.199
and like weird political manipulation

4972.8 --> 4977.6
plans and he probably knew about the

4975.199 --> 4979.36
setup of the freaking fake holocaust

4977.6 --> 4980.4800000000005
garbage all that

4979.36 --> 4981.92
yeah

4980.48 --> 4983.36
i still

4981.92 --> 4985.84
like him

4983.36 --> 4988.239
you hear me i still

4985.84 --> 4989.52
like him

4988.239 --> 4993.678999999999
why

4989.52 --> 4993.679
because at least he had freaking balls

4994.159 --> 4998.679
everybody was a [ __ ] wussy

5001.679 --> 5006.159
and i just like this character if

5004.48 --> 5009.12
like the way it was represented in the

5006.159 --> 5011.04
movie it was anywhere near what he was

5009.12 --> 5012.0
really like and he probably did their

5011.04 --> 5014.8
best

5012.0 --> 5020.32
to do that i like him

5014.8 --> 5024.159000000001
i don't care if he had [ __ ] evil [ __ ]

5020.32 --> 5026.32
don't care i don't care you hear me i

5024.159 --> 5029.5199999999995
don't care

5026.32 --> 5032.88
there is no [ __ ] people in this world

5029.52 --> 5036.8
that have power that are not evil

5032.88 --> 5038.4800000000005
they don't exist they never existed you

5036.8 --> 5041.679
understand

5038.48 --> 5042.638999999999
stop projecting your stupid idyllic

5041.679 --> 5045.4400000000005
image

5042.639 --> 5049.96
onto the world it doesn't work like that

5045.44 --> 5049.96
it never works like that

5067.04 --> 5071.92
yeah firebombing civilians and him yeah

5069.52 --> 5074.56
it was super [ __ ] up that was that's

5071.92 --> 5077.52
what happened afterward

5074.56 --> 5080.8
and i and i'm don't like him for that

5077.52 --> 5083.679
yeah i'm not saying that's a good thing

5080.8 --> 5085.84
it is an atrocity

5083.679 --> 5085.84
yeah

5087.12 --> 5091.12
still like him

5088.96 --> 5093.36
i just don't like he did that yeah

5091.12 --> 5096.239
remember with trump trump oh he's so

5093.36 --> 5099.679
great oh but he pushes the facts

5096.239 --> 5101.5199999999995
yeah i don't like that trump did that

5099.679 --> 5103.4400000000005
yeah i don't like

5101.52 --> 5106.719
that freaking putin

5103.44 --> 5110.0
let those faxes into his country i don't

5106.719 --> 5112.08
like that i really don't yeah

5110.0 --> 5114.639
does that mean but because he did that

5112.08 --> 5117.76
oh he's got the stamp now i have to

5114.639 --> 5120.159000000001
shove him straight into the garbage bin

5117.76 --> 5124.08
with the other evil people that can

5120.159 --> 5128.92
never be good yeah no i don't do that

5124.08 --> 5128.92
because i'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ]

5145.04 --> 5149.76
yeah i hate

5147.28 --> 5152.239
the bomb the bombing of dresden it was

5149.76 --> 5153.280000000001
atrocious i really hate that that

5152.239 --> 5156.4
happened

5153.28 --> 5158.5599999999995
it was very [ __ ] painful and just

5156.4 --> 5161.28
horrific

5158.56 --> 5162.080000000001
and you could say i do hate churchill

5161.28 --> 5164.719
for

5162.08 --> 5165.84
being part of that i hate him for that

5164.719 --> 5166.84
that was

5165.84 --> 5168.639
really

5166.84 --> 5170.639
[ __ ]

5168.639 --> 5174.0
but other than that

5170.639 --> 5174.0
i liked him i liked

5175.6 --> 5177.84
just

5178.32 --> 5182.4
that he was

5180.56 --> 5184.639
able to basically

5182.4 --> 5187.36
prevent hitler from literally taking

5184.639 --> 5187.36
over europe

5190.56 --> 5195.4400000000005
and that he had the courage

5192.88 --> 5196.719
to do that and that he freaking suffered

5195.44 --> 5200.48
for that

5196.719 --> 5200.4800000000005
psychologically suffered

5209.84 --> 5216.52
second opinion on that please

5212.239 --> 5216.5199999999995
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

5243.87 --> 5248.639
[Music]

5246.239 --> 5250.839999999999
yeah that's right woodworking gunny bear

5248.639 --> 5252.719
thank you for that

5250.84 --> 5255.6
finally

5252.719 --> 5258.159
i just want people to stop being such

5255.6 --> 5260.719
freaking weenies

5258.159 --> 5262.879999999999
say yes evil badness

5260.719 --> 5266.2390000000005
you have to be evil

5262.88 --> 5268.8
because a person is only ever defined by

5266.239 --> 5271.04
that one [ __ ] up thing they did right

5268.8 --> 5274.159000000001
that's the only thing they have ever

5271.04 --> 5276.8
done is that one [ __ ] bad thing it's

5274.159 --> 5280.4
always the same with you stupid [ __ ]

5276.8 --> 5283.76
influence influenceable people

5280.4 --> 5285.28
always the same superficial [ __ ]

5283.76 --> 5287.280000000001
response

5285.28 --> 5289.5199999999995
i hated about you

5287.28 --> 5292.32
why do you always do that

5289.52 --> 5295.4400000000005
the [ __ ] oversimplification

5292.32 --> 5297.28
like a person can only ever be the one

5295.44 --> 5300.239
bad thing they've done

5297.28 --> 5302.719
would you get the [ __ ] over yourself and

5300.239 --> 5305.959999999999
actually get some perspective for crying

5302.719 --> 5305.96
out loud

5341.199 --> 5346.5599999999995
god

5342.96 --> 5349.44
i don't know why i even try anymore

5346.56 --> 5351.280000000001
why do i even try any of this

5349.44 --> 5355.5599999999995
any of it

5351.28 --> 5355.5599999999995
always the same [ __ ]

5384.8 --> 5388.2390000000005
ha woodworking gunny bear yeah i bet it

5387.28 --> 5391.88
does

5388.239 --> 5391.879999999999
it's a great distraction

5395.12 --> 5400.96
yeah that's right jeff gas head

5398.96 --> 5403.52
but that's not the same right because

5400.96 --> 5407.08
church so bad

5403.52 --> 5407.080000000001
he was bad

5408.56 --> 5414.080000000001
to be fair we're still better than

5410.08 --> 5414.08
liberals i'm not arguing about that

5415.84 --> 5421.1990000000005
right

5417.84 --> 5422.4800000000005
because that's the [ __ ] thing yeah

5421.199 --> 5424.4
churchill

5422.48 --> 5425.12
was surrounded

5424.4 --> 5427.199
by

5425.12 --> 5429.84
liberals

5427.199 --> 5433.199
they were acting like liberals they were

5429.84 --> 5436.08
being weenies they were gonna let hitler

5433.199 --> 5440.159
just do whatever the [ __ ] he wanted

5436.08 --> 5440.159
they were being complete wussies

5445.12 --> 5450.08
i don't know man i've maybe just that

5447.36 --> 5452.48
movie got to me or something

5450.08 --> 5455.5199999999995
maybe it's the most devious propaganda

5452.48 --> 5460.08
device ever

5455.52 --> 5460.080000000001
and i fell for it i don't know man

5473.52 --> 5479.120000000001
it's just that

5474.88 --> 5480.719
technically most historical figures

5479.12 --> 5482.8
do stand out

5480.719 --> 5486.0
they're all rotting in hell

5482.8 --> 5488.639
because they've all done horrific [ __ ]

5486.0 --> 5491.12
up things

5488.639 --> 5493.4400000000005
but why you know

5491.12 --> 5494.719
that's always the bigger picture

5493.44 --> 5498.0
and that's

5494.719 --> 5498.0
why they were there

5498.88 --> 5503.12
and why they did those [ __ ] up things

5503.76 --> 5509.52
is never just random it's never just a

5507.04 --> 5509.5199999999995
mistake

5510.0 --> 5516.0
and people just don't want to understand

5513.6 --> 5519.84
it they don't want to understand it and

5516.0 --> 5519.84
i'm so annoyed by that

5544.96 --> 5550.0
no that's that's oppenheimer flatters

5547.28 --> 5553.48
age that's not winston churchill

5550.0 --> 5553.48
that was american

5560.96 --> 5564.76
i think right

5587.04 --> 5591.84
yeah i agree woodworking gunny bear i

5588.88 --> 5594.159000000001
really like your attitude

5591.84 --> 5596.96
and i'm sorry i'm being really

5594.159 --> 5599.839999999999
kind of harsh dude it's blame it on

5596.96 --> 5602.2390000000005
churchill he freaking inspired me man

5599.84 --> 5604.32
like watching that movie him being the

5602.239 --> 5607.36
way he is i'm like

5604.32 --> 5609.679
[ __ ] yeah man that guy knows how to

5607.36 --> 5614.08
freaking get people in line

5609.679 --> 5614.08
i love that i really liked it

5614.48 --> 5621.759999999999
so i just yeah

5617.199 --> 5621.759999999999
i i really enjoyed watching that movie

5622.639 --> 5627.76
and i liked how he was also just

5627.84 --> 5631.6
being

5628.8 --> 5634.88
like you got an inside look in

5631.6 --> 5636.639
how he was in certain ways improvising

5634.88 --> 5638.88
to the best of his abilities and

5636.639 --> 5640.639
sometimes he was winging it

5638.88 --> 5642.2390000000005
and i just thought like

5640.639 --> 5645.6
dude i

5642.239 --> 5649.239
i'm so respecting that

5645.6 --> 5649.2390000000005
i don't know man

5660.96 --> 5667.12
was it roosevelt oh okay okay

5665.04 --> 5670.639
sorry i got it mixed up i'm not like

5667.12 --> 5673.84
super fantastic with all the quotes

5670.639 --> 5673.84
historical quotes

5675.44 --> 5678.879999999999
yeah

5677.04 --> 5682.96
but yeah those were definitely like

5678.88 --> 5685.96
three noteworthy figures roosevelt

5682.96 --> 5685.96
oppenheimer

5686.48 --> 5692.48
and churchill they all have said like

5688.88 --> 5692.4800000000005
pretty impressive things

5692.639 --> 5695.92
like in that time period

5698.8 --> 5704.08
do i prefer authoritative

5702.44 --> 5707.199
autocracy

5704.08 --> 5707.199
over democracy

5707.28 --> 5711.759999999999
that all depends

5708.96 --> 5713.92
on who has the authority

5711.76 --> 5716.320000000001
it's basic you're basically asking do

5713.92 --> 5717.36
you like a king

5716.32 --> 5720.4
over

5717.36 --> 5720.4
a giant tribe

5721.44 --> 5726.159
like a decentralized tribe

5723.679 --> 5728.4
that's what you're asking uh

5726.159 --> 5731.28
that all depends you know

5728.4 --> 5734.0
i mean there's some really great kings

5731.28 --> 5736.239
and there's some really terrible kings

5734.0 --> 5737.84
so

5736.239 --> 5740.48
yeah

5737.84 --> 5742.8
sometimes authoritative autocracy works

5740.48 --> 5745.04
a lot better than democracy

5742.8 --> 5746.400000000001
and sometimes it leads to absolute

5745.04 --> 5749.5199999999995
disaster

5746.4 --> 5749.5199999999995
so it all depends

5753.44 --> 5757.839999999999
right it always depends on the leader

5770.56 --> 5776.2390000000005
and democracies always end up being too

5773.84 --> 5778.8
late with things

5776.239 --> 5780.48
always pulling the shortest the yeah the

5778.8 --> 5783.119000000001
shortest straw

5780.48 --> 5785.28
in situations where things

5783.119 --> 5788.32
like ramp up

5785.28 --> 5791.44
go more quickly

5788.32 --> 5793.5199999999995
they always end up too late pulling the

5791.44 --> 5796.799999999999
short straw that's that's what always

5793.52 --> 5796.8
happens to democracies

5819.92 --> 5823.84
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

5821.6 --> 5823.84
show

5823.92 --> 5830.4
did not exactly

5826.639 --> 5830.400000000001
take a direction i expected

5832.56 --> 5836.159000000001
but i just yeah this is just my honest

5834.8 --> 5838.320000000001
view

5836.159 --> 5842.159
i feel like that i've already said like

5838.32 --> 5843.04
yeah i i really hate the dresden bombing

5842.159 --> 5846.239
like i

5843.04 --> 5848.4
that's like a personal pain

5846.239 --> 5850.718999999999
so yeah

5848.4 --> 5852.32
i really don't like that he did that

5850.719 --> 5853.52
that's like

5852.32 --> 5856.0
like

5853.52 --> 5858.400000000001
want him basically punch in the freaking

5856.0 --> 5859.44
face type of response that's my response

5858.4 --> 5861.44
to him

5859.44 --> 5865.5199999999995
but despite that

5861.44 --> 5866.839999999999
i still think that overall

5865.52 --> 5870.2390000000005
like he's

5866.84 --> 5873.1990000000005
been just a very

5870.239 --> 5874.32
fascinating character

5873.199 --> 5878.08
that

5874.32 --> 5881.28
i feel admiration for in certain ways

5878.08 --> 5884.08
not all of them but in certain ways

5881.28 --> 5886.159
and i just wanted to share that

5884.08 --> 5888.239
and then i had to watch everybody squirt

5886.159 --> 5889.679
over it

5888.239 --> 5892.799999999999
so be it

5889.679 --> 5892.8
i've set my piece

5894.08 --> 5897.44
right anyway

5895.52 --> 5899.040000000001
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5897.44 --> 5901.599999999999

5899.04 --> 5902.8
good bit over the place

5901.6 --> 5903.84
but good

5902.8 --> 5905.28
and

5903.84 --> 5907.360000000001
yeah despite

5905.28 --> 5911.5199999999995
