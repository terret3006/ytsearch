Sunday the 11th of November 2021

218.22 --> 223.7
huh

220.62 --> 223.70000000000002
and what a Sunday

230.819 --> 235.79899999999998
still a little cold though

233.879 --> 237.599
now that the sun isn't hitting the room

235.799 --> 238.799
anymore but

237.599 --> 242.06
yeah

238.799 --> 242.06
I can deal with that

246.12 --> 249.98000000000002
so how are you guys doing

258.419 --> 263.59999999999997
yeah man yesterday evening it was like a

261.419 --> 263.59999999999997
really

266.84 --> 270.02
say that

271.08 --> 277.19899999999996
it's a bit tense like

274.62 --> 279.12
I had rest I had on the line and now

277.199 --> 280.259
that was a great conversation it was

279.12 --> 284.54
basically

280.259 --> 284.54
showing me his Spoils of War

285.78 --> 290.94
pretty epic stuff like he's got like

288.419 --> 293.03999999999996
awesome guitar he showed

290.94 --> 295.56
and

293.04 --> 298.02000000000004
yeah at the same time my friend from

295.56 --> 299.639
naime

298.02 --> 303.59999999999997
was like

299.639 --> 307.32
yeah she kind of got sick

303.6 --> 309.36
well she's like really busy and she

307.32 --> 311.21999999999997
by force I have it basically trying to

309.36 --> 313.259
pull through everything but it was like

311.22 --> 315.90000000000003
really giving her pain

313.259 --> 317.039
she effectively got like very lower back

315.9 --> 319.25899999999996
pain

317.039 --> 320.28
and she's just like yeah but I can't

319.259 --> 323.6
stop

320.28 --> 328.55999999999995
like yeah yeah you can

323.6 --> 330.6
so I got her as far as to basically

328.56 --> 333.3
have her kids stay over with the

330.6 --> 336.66
grandparents for a while so she can just

333.3 --> 340.199
be alone without any people around her

336.66 --> 342.66
and just chill out and

340.199 --> 344.94
rest a lot take good care of her and

342.66 --> 348.24
just not get [ __ ] on her mind all the

344.94 --> 350.52
time and she's doing that

348.24 --> 354.62
but yeah that was quite tense

350.52 --> 354.62
she was really like panicking over that

356.88 --> 361.56
because yeah she was basically just

359.58 --> 364.81899999999996
keep going even though I'm physically

361.56 --> 364.819
tortured like hello

365.34 --> 369.31899999999996
you don't have to do it like that

369.419 --> 374.69899999999996
right like say a few years ago

372.6 --> 376.74
everything was so tense and like people

374.699 --> 380.41900000000004
were kind of hostile to her because of

376.74 --> 382.199
like social spats and

380.419 --> 384.29999999999995
just

382.199 --> 387.3
crazy situation

384.3 --> 390.419
so then she didn't have the luxury right

387.3 --> 393.479
now she has some good relations and she

390.419 --> 395.639
can basically make her kid go over to

393.479 --> 400.31899999999996
the grandparents for a while like she

395.639 --> 403.02
knows like yeah that's okay considering

400.319 --> 405.91900000000004
the circumstances so yeah I don't know I

403.02 --> 405.919
was glad to help out

406.639 --> 411.12
11th

408.419 --> 415.21999999999997
11th what

411.12 --> 415.22
Stone monkey what are you talking about

419.039 --> 425.34

421.979 --> 428.3
I meant 21st huh

425.34 --> 428.29999999999995
I switched it

429.24 --> 433.759
right okay yeah sorry about that

446.22 --> 453.18
right also stupid

450.0 --> 456.18
like the trolls have been added again

453.18 --> 458.16
started spreading rumors about Dell

456.18 --> 460.979
how he supposedly

458.16 --> 464.639
offed himself and it's yeah he did a

460.979 --> 468.62
live stream so he didn't do that

464.639 --> 468.62
but it's just like dude

470.22 --> 475.08000000000004
and it was freaking Logan's Run doing

472.379 --> 478.259
that so yeah

475.08 --> 480.84
like he he's just been kind of trying to

478.259 --> 483.66
like oh come on Arwin unban me it was

480.84 --> 486.44
just a joke and now he's doing this like

483.66 --> 486.44
yeah dude

487.139 --> 492.90000000000003
yeah you're no longer welcome here like

490.68 --> 496.139
that I don't like that sort of joke

492.9 --> 500.23999999999995
that's really terrible

496.139 --> 500.24
that's not funny to me

500.46 --> 503.12
so

503.28 --> 506.35999999999996
there's that

507.96 --> 515.279
uh own pension had this really great

511.199 --> 517.26
skit sketch hilarious

515.279 --> 520.399
I'm gonna share it with you

517.26 --> 520.399
it's so funny

522.36 --> 527.0
it looks pretty well it looks pretty

524.519 --> 527.0
good too

544.2 --> 550.339
yep saw that he's been last week too

551.82 --> 554.48
hmm

559.339 --> 562.86
I don't know what's wrong with these

561.42 --> 566.399
people really

562.86 --> 569.24
like why do you keep doing that

566.399 --> 569.24
it's just

571.2 --> 576.72
cheap shock humor and like manipulative

578.64 --> 584.459
and it's so false afterwards so it's

581.22 --> 586.44
it's like stupid jump scares in movies

584.459 --> 589.56
you know those

586.44 --> 593.0
like some jump scares if it's really

589.56 --> 593.0
carefully thought out

593.519 --> 598.5600000000001
and like the tensions building towards

595.56 --> 600.38
it yeah okay that's it's terrifying but

598.56 --> 603.4799999999999
it's actually

600.38 --> 606.899
appropriate with but it's very difficult

603.48 --> 608.82
to do it but the really cheap ass horror

606.899 --> 611.579
movies and all that and

608.82 --> 613.44
they they always like just out of

611.579 --> 615.42
nowhere something stupid happens or

613.44 --> 617.94
somebody pops up

615.42 --> 620.04
and it's like really annoying and that's

617.94 --> 623.8800000000001
what these guys are doing now

620.04 --> 625.68
by the way not not Owen Benjamin not

623.88 --> 626.76
that link I'm talking about the trolls

625.68 --> 628.14
out there

626.76 --> 630.36
like

628.14 --> 634.5
just cheap

630.36 --> 634.5
jump scare jokes

634.86 --> 639.6
and everybody hates that so what are you

637.68 --> 643.0999999999999
gonna accomplish with that except just

639.6 --> 643.1
making everybody hate you

656.279 --> 662.1
anything to disrupt your show

659.16 --> 664.98
well there are those that

662.1 --> 667.88
like the real the gamma trolls that's

664.98 --> 667.88
different right

668.459 --> 673.92
because like they're high tension every

671.76 --> 675.899
time they get in I can immediately feel

673.92 --> 678.5
that they're just

675.899 --> 681.24
their entire spirit is set to like

678.5 --> 683.399
octopus mode and

681.24 --> 685.74
they just try to get

683.399 --> 688.98
worm in between

685.74 --> 692.16
get get their tentacles in and it's

688.98 --> 693.4200000000001
really palpable I can feel that but this

692.16 --> 696.36
guy

693.42 --> 699.24
it's like he's just bored

696.36 --> 702.0
and they just make up outrageous [ __ ]

699.24 --> 704.94
out of boredom because

702.0 --> 707.279
it's different it feels different

704.94 --> 709.44
you don't feel like they're up to

707.279 --> 711.6
something they're not like in gravel

709.44 --> 715.7600000000001
mode and they're not

711.6 --> 715.76
using their spirit in their attack

719.94 --> 724.8000000000001
it's just Cheap Thrills really stupid

722.82 --> 726.98
anyway

724.8 --> 726.9799999999999
foreign

734.81 --> 737.93
[Music]

738.42 --> 744.24
but also like

740.459 --> 746.04
annoying like that's crazy like that

744.24 --> 748.7
would never

746.04 --> 748.6999999999999
do that

750.899 --> 756.36
but then did like really double down and

753.42 --> 758.8199999999999
roll out the like it's real that's just

756.36 --> 760.5600000000001
it's a foul it's really disgusting

758.82 --> 763.639
anyway

760.56 --> 763.6389999999999
I'm glad he's okay

768.66 --> 773.16
he has a crazy Intro by the way

771.6 --> 776.0400000000001
these days

773.16 --> 778.76
a really weird

776.04 --> 778.76
but funny

781.92 --> 785.24
the weird wobbly face

795.06 --> 797.5999999999999
right

801.899 --> 805.16
also watch back

805.8 --> 812.66
oh right yeah there was ball busters I

809.04 --> 812.66
didn't get in the panel I was

813.48 --> 819.0
that was like right after

816.18 --> 821.76
I had been

819.0 --> 824.579
yeah calling a lot the rest down the

821.76 --> 826.62
line and with my friend from Nightmare

824.579 --> 827.88
so it was like I was just like kind of

826.62 --> 830.699
toasty

827.88 --> 831.48
that probably reflected itself in the

830.699 --> 833.279
chat

831.48 --> 836.3000000000001
because I just hung around in chat

833.279 --> 836.3
during ball busters

837.0 --> 840.38
kind of like joking around

842.82 --> 846.98
we're still good Bob bosses to listen to

847.5 --> 850.22
uh

852.839 --> 856.74
also by the way yeah

854.76 --> 860.3389999999999
the premiere

856.74 --> 863.48
which was from Thursday's show

860.339 --> 863.48
it was really good

863.519 --> 867.32
I thought I did well too

868.32 --> 873.019
being concise not rambly

873.18 --> 878.279
I'm always better than when I'm concise

875.639 --> 880.44
as when I'm getting rambly and just

878.279 --> 882.8389999999999
constantly want to keep talking

880.44 --> 885.0
it's annoying it's like it's tough to

882.839 --> 888.8000000000001
stop

885.0 --> 888.8
when that happens anyway

910.019 --> 916.68
oh yeah made by Jim Bob

913.139 --> 917.639
is going at it with

916.68 --> 920.779
um

917.639 --> 920.779
Nathan Thompson

920.82 --> 925.1
going after his fanatical veganism

925.44 --> 928.94

953.36 --> 959.04
vacuum cleaning doing the dishes

957.18 --> 961.3389999999999
it's been five minutes of silence and

959.04 --> 961.3389999999999
chat

970.44 --> 973.2790000000001
ah

1014.12 --> 1021.1
me about that anyway You Are Not Alone

1017.3 --> 1021.0999999999999
yeah I know I'm not alone but

1021.199 --> 1024.74
I'm just kind of like really chilling

1023.3 --> 1027.62
out here

1024.74 --> 1030.6200000000001
it's such an enjoyable day

1027.62 --> 1033.62
so I guess I'm a little mellow

1030.62 --> 1035.6
but I feel positive

1033.62 --> 1037.28
I'm really I'm just kind of like really

1035.6 --> 1040.52
happy I was able to help my friend

1037.28 --> 1042.98
yesterday but it was so tense and like I

1040.52 --> 1045.319
realized like if I'm gonna like

1042.98 --> 1047.72
not give the right advice like she might

1045.319 --> 1049.8799999999999
it might really end up bad first because

1047.72 --> 1052.22
she was in serious agony

1049.88 --> 1054.64
right

1052.22 --> 1058.78
I'm gonna check up on her but again

1054.64 --> 1058.7800000000002
today to see how she's doing

1061.46 --> 1066.38
how about that baby truther show Jared

1064.7 --> 1067.64
took down

1066.38 --> 1070.3400000000001
what

1067.64 --> 1072.5
oh oh God uh

1070.34 --> 1075.62
a lot of yard Sanford yeah I heard about

1072.5 --> 1077.059
that but I haven't seen anything

1075.62 --> 1079.9599999999998
yet

1077.059 --> 1079.96
so like

1082.4 --> 1087.3200000000002
like what I heard some weird things

1084.86 --> 1089.9599999999998
about that

1087.32 --> 1092.48
maybe they just yeah

1089.96 --> 1094.82
maybe they got into the wrong frequency

1092.48 --> 1097.28
or something like they just started to

1094.82 --> 1099.2
lay out things but

1097.28 --> 1101.12
kind of out of place or something I

1099.2 --> 1102.74
don't know what it was laughing about

1101.12 --> 1106.4189999999999
violence

1102.74 --> 1106.419
well that's difficult though

1109.22 --> 1113.179
like it's like

1111.32 --> 1116.72
it could have been like kind of a

1113.179 --> 1118.88
leftist defiant joke set up and then

1116.72 --> 1122.48
just didn't really hit the right

1118.88 --> 1124.46
frequency you know jokes can fail when

1122.48 --> 1126.38
you improvise

1124.46 --> 1128.8600000000001
so I don't know what happened I haven't

1126.38 --> 1128.8600000000001
seen it

1131.6 --> 1136.84
David Wise laughs at a woman being

1133.64 --> 1136.8400000000001
beaten yeah

1137.96 --> 1141.16
oh geez

1151.94 --> 1155.919
Flat Earth has become a popularity

1154.039 --> 1160.22
contest lately

1155.919 --> 1162.98
really lately no

1160.22 --> 1167.48
now it's it's been a popularity like

1162.98 --> 1170.3600000000001
popularity is very important attention

1167.48 --> 1172.48
all right so that's been like that for a

1170.36 --> 1172.4799999999998
while

1180.26 --> 1184.24
all right so I look

1185.9 --> 1190.46
sometimes certain people try out new

1189.02 --> 1194.36
stuff

1190.46 --> 1197.0
and then it seems like a good time like

1194.36 --> 1198.86
for it and seems like a good idea and

1197.0 --> 1200.419
it's the time for it and then you try it

1198.86 --> 1203.7199999999998
out and it's like

1200.419 --> 1206.9
did not roll out as you thought it would

1203.72 --> 1209.0
and then you feel really stupid

1206.9 --> 1212.0590000000002
and realize like wow there's like

1209.0 --> 1215.419
certain angles how you can view that and

1212.059 --> 1218.84
it looks really bad and maybe like it

1215.419 --> 1220.039
wasn't built up right it yeah jokes can

1218.84 --> 1222.3799999999999
fail

1220.039 --> 1224.48
and then make you look real feel really

1222.38 --> 1228.0200000000002
stupid it's

1224.48 --> 1230.6
so I think that is probably it

1228.02 --> 1233.539
just tried a joke

1230.6 --> 1235.28
and didn't roll out the way he planned

1233.539 --> 1237.62
it

1235.28 --> 1240.28
because if it did then he wouldn't have

1237.62 --> 1240.28
taken it down

1245.96 --> 1249.799
and look there's some weird [ __ ] going

1248.659 --> 1252.44
on

1249.799 --> 1254.78
out there like

1252.44 --> 1256.6000000000001
with certain groups of people and

1254.78 --> 1259.3999999999999
sometimes

1256.6 --> 1261.3799999999999
comedians try to appeal to very specific

1259.4 --> 1262.7
things

1261.38 --> 1265.4
like

1262.7 --> 1267.8600000000001
if you just think like oh wow I'm

1265.4 --> 1269.8400000000001
dealing with like really [ __ ] women

1267.86 --> 1272.78
like terrible

1269.84 --> 1275.72
nothing like any we know around here

1272.78 --> 1278.539
like nobody I know

1275.72 --> 1281.78
that I deal with on the internet

1278.539 --> 1282.98
is like that at all but they are out

1281.78 --> 1284.799
there

1282.98 --> 1288.02
and they can be like

1284.799 --> 1289.8799999999999
very aggravating so maybe he was trying

1288.02 --> 1290.9
to appeal to people that deal with that

1289.88 --> 1293.6000000000001
a lot

1290.9 --> 1297.0800000000002
right because to those people that might

1293.6 --> 1298.82
be like hahaha yeah like I maybe they

1297.08 --> 1300.4399999999998
want to beat him up sometimes but they

1298.82 --> 1301.28
don't do it because they know it doesn't

1300.44 --> 1304.52
help

1301.28 --> 1306.2
but that doesn't make the inner need go

1304.52 --> 1310.1589999999999
away right so

1306.2 --> 1312.32
complicated I agree it's bad taste I

1310.159 --> 1314.9
don't think beating women is funny I've

1312.32 --> 1317.6589999999999
never laid a finger

1314.9 --> 1319.22
on a woman without her asking me for it

1317.659 --> 1322.6000000000001
literally

1319.22 --> 1322.6000000000001
carefully because

1322.82 --> 1327.62
no I don't I don't like even if they'd

1325.46 --> 1330.679
ask that

1327.62 --> 1332.7199999999998
it would have to be like a really flamed

1330.679 --> 1333.74
up crazy situation I don't go there

1332.72 --> 1336.559
anymore

1333.74 --> 1339.5
and even when I did back when I was

1336.559 --> 1340.7
younger like I don't like it I don't

1339.5 --> 1342.02
like it

1340.7 --> 1343.94
like maybe

1342.02 --> 1347.179
a little slap on the bum or something

1343.94 --> 1350.0800000000002
but other than that I don't like I don't

1347.179 --> 1353.799
I just wanna

1350.08 --> 1353.799
I don't like that

1354.08 --> 1360.1999999999998
right

1356.36 --> 1361.2199999999998
and I definitely despise people that are

1360.2 --> 1364.52
men

1361.22 --> 1367.94
I guess also women but just men

1364.52 --> 1371.6589999999999
that basically would let their anger

1367.94 --> 1374.539
make them physically dominated woman

1371.659 --> 1377.24
in social situations using violence I

1374.539 --> 1380.6
despise that so I don't personally think

1377.24 --> 1385.1
it's funny but I can because of my

1380.6 --> 1386.84
mental flexibility and oversight project

1385.1 --> 1389.4189999999999
understand

1386.84 --> 1392.9599999999998
that they thought it might it could have

1389.419 --> 1395.5590000000002
been funny in a specific context and it

1392.96 --> 1395.559
just flopped

1395.84 --> 1398.62
that's it

1398.9 --> 1407.1200000000001
right hey how about that never seen it

1403.76 --> 1409.64
am I anywhere close or was it just like

1407.12 --> 1412.52
really

1409.64 --> 1416.3600000000001
wrong like

1412.52 --> 1419.72
not a mistake I'm yeah

1416.36 --> 1421.34
since it's taken down I I don't know

1419.72 --> 1425.38
I'm asking

1421.34 --> 1425.3799999999999
for your input your judgment

1425.539 --> 1431.14
through a woman into a TV what

1433.1 --> 1439.36
I hello by the way that flat fellow

1435.38 --> 1439.3600000000001
thanks for the 99 cent Super Chat

1447.799 --> 1450.799
what

1453.919 --> 1458.74
what are you talking about George

1456.2 --> 1458.74
Sanford

1460.76 --> 1466.059
so they took some kind of a scene from a

1463.34 --> 1466.059
movie or something

1469.88 --> 1476.0590000000002
right

1471.799 --> 1479.74
okay yeah so that's like shock humor

1476.059 --> 1479.74
a little rough I guess

1480.32 --> 1482.98
I didn't know

1494.12 --> 1500.26
wait what

1496.58 --> 1504.799
oh so it wasn't like a uh an acting

1500.26 --> 1507.34
piece it was actual like footage from a

1504.799 --> 1507.34
live scene

1507.86 --> 1513.08
oh like a

1510.74 --> 1516.4
security cam or something

1513.08 --> 1516.3999999999999
or somebody's mobile

1524.419 --> 1527.0200000000002
hmm

1529.82 --> 1535.1
all right well yeah what that still

1532.52 --> 1540.1
doesn't undo my

1535.1 --> 1540.1
my analysis of what's probably going on

1541.76 --> 1548.179
right I think they probably just thought

1544.46 --> 1551.74
it was funny at the time and then

1548.179 --> 1551.74
yeah didn't work out

1555.26 --> 1558.58
dude can happen

1558.98 --> 1564.44
ancestral wins can do all kinds of weird

1561.44 --> 1567.74
[ __ ] to your perception and to your

1564.44 --> 1570.52
analysis like what is good even

1567.74 --> 1570.52
and what is funny

1572.0 --> 1579.279
it's the time of the year for that

1575.179 --> 1579.279
meanwhile Earth is flat yep

1580.64 --> 1582.76
okay

1587.659 --> 1593.5590000000002
no

1590.6 --> 1593.559
got some

1595.22 --> 1598.779
like red orange juice

1599.059 --> 1603.62
I kind of need it because I ran out of

1601.4 --> 1605.98
vitamin C

1603.62 --> 1605.9799999999998
uh

1606.62 --> 1611.32
hopefully soon I'll be able to get a new

1609.08 --> 1611.32
batch

1619.279 --> 1624.02
when you put people on a pedestal

1621.2 --> 1627.14
they're gonna let you down well

1624.02 --> 1628.1589999999999
if you start to overestimate them if you

1627.14 --> 1631.279
start to

1628.159 --> 1634.5800000000002
turn like Smooth out their actions and

1631.279 --> 1636.74
for try to form an icon out of them yeah

1634.58 --> 1638.059
but if you just know their people and

1636.74 --> 1640.52
know

1638.059 --> 1642.6789999999999
like paid attention to when things went

1640.52 --> 1644.48
wrong and like to figure out just like

1642.679 --> 1645.919
how are they experiencing what they're

1644.48 --> 1648.82
doing

1645.919 --> 1648.8200000000002
naturally

1648.919 --> 1654.8600000000001
and then you do yeah you can end up like

1652.46 --> 1657.5
what I do basically try to give a

1654.86 --> 1660.02
detailed analysis of like what it

1657.5 --> 1662.779
probably happened

1660.02 --> 1664.76
because I know they're not like really

1662.779 --> 1668.539
bad guys they're not like trying to

1664.76 --> 1670.1
shove evil up your nose

1668.539 --> 1673.039
because if they would they would have

1670.1 --> 1676.9599999999998
let it uh they would have kept it up

1673.039 --> 1676.96
so I think they made a mistake

1677.6 --> 1684.3799999999999
a judgment mistake like it seemed funny

1680.84 --> 1686.4189999999999
at the time and then afterwards like wow

1684.38 --> 1688.22
how did we think that was funny that

1686.419 --> 1691.279
rolled out completely wrong it happened

1688.22 --> 1694.34
sometimes especially when the ancestral

1691.279 --> 1696.5
winds are blowing and that's the time of

1694.34 --> 1700.72
the year for that

1696.5 --> 1700.72
people make mistakes judgment mistakes

1702.38 --> 1707.659
I make it myself sometimes

1705.26 --> 1709.94
that's why I try to address them and

1707.659 --> 1712.64
then ask for input like I have yesterday

1709.94 --> 1715.1200000000001
and the day before about that really

1712.64 --> 1715.1200000000001
serious

1715.72 --> 1723.58
situation in the world

1718.88 --> 1723.5800000000002
like because I am not certain I'm just

1724.76 --> 1730.059
making a calculation basically in my

1727.88 --> 1730.0590000000002
mind

1730.46 --> 1733.24
virtually

1734.72 --> 1740.1200000000001
putting it all together anyway

1737.779 --> 1742.52
but I don't know like I might have

1740.12 --> 1745.039
overlooked something because yeah it is

1742.52 --> 1747.08
that time of the year where that can

1745.039 --> 1751.299
happen

1747.08 --> 1751.299
some things are just concealed here

1764.559 --> 1770.24
yeah like hey Mike said an itch you

1768.5 --> 1772.96
watch it live

1770.24 --> 1772.96
I call it

1775.399 --> 1778.2399999999998
I thought so

1779.659 --> 1782.14
all right

1786.799 --> 1794.059
well look George Sanford

1790.22 --> 1798.32
if I can continue on my analytical

1794.059 --> 1800.0
approach this why why did they sadly

1798.32 --> 1801.62
think that was funny

1800.0 --> 1804.08
Maybe

1801.62 --> 1806.2399999999998
they're having kind of like backlash

1804.08 --> 1809.4189999999999
from doing their

1806.24 --> 1812.419
super reversed world show right

1809.419 --> 1815.1200000000001
when they get like news readers and then

1812.419 --> 1817.5200000000002
they do the opposite they they start to

1815.12 --> 1819.559
act like a CNN but even more insane and

1817.52 --> 1823.399
extreme

1819.559 --> 1825.44
well maybe that's like by accidental

1823.399 --> 1827.6589999999999
accidentally rubbing off on them because

1825.44 --> 1829.88
yeah that's what the Reversed world does

1827.659 --> 1832.22
whether you act it or whether you

1829.88 --> 1836.2
actually just live it

1832.22 --> 1836.2
it switches things around and then

1838.039 --> 1844.94
because it goes way too far you by

1841.22 --> 1847.76
accident take that on as normal

1844.94 --> 1852.44
so they just went too far and didn't

1847.76 --> 1855.2
sense it because they were kind of like

1852.44 --> 1857.1200000000001
that running joke with that show

1855.2 --> 1858.8600000000001
was still rubbing off on them that's

1857.12 --> 1862.6999999999998
what I think is probably happening I

1858.86 --> 1865.399
warned about that that it's dangerous

1862.7 --> 1868.22
it's interesting but it yeah that [ __ ]

1865.399 --> 1871.1589999999999
can do play tricks on your own mind even

1868.22 --> 1873.5
though you know it's a joke

1871.159 --> 1876.0800000000002
you conduct yourself

1873.5 --> 1878.419
in a way that's kind of unnatural and

1876.08 --> 1882.22
that rubs off on you

1878.419 --> 1882.22
by accident at first

1884.419 --> 1889.419
Giddish humor yes

1886.76 --> 1889.419
Maybe

1893.299 --> 1901.46
Alex Steen oh god well that guy yeah

1897.559 --> 1903.5
he's the one that just goes

1901.46 --> 1906.8600000000001
like

1903.5 --> 1908.72
extreme distance like he's a guy that

1906.86 --> 1910.899
doesn't have any limits sometimes I

1908.72 --> 1910.8990000000001
think

1911.779 --> 1916.58
because in that show what is it called

1914.24 --> 1920.539
again GNN

1916.58 --> 1922.58
Global News Network like he just

1920.539 --> 1924.5
goes into like

1922.58 --> 1926.62
scary territory

1924.5 --> 1930.5
so he

1926.62 --> 1933.559
might be pushing it pushing the guys too

1930.5 --> 1936.94
far as well I don't know

1933.559 --> 1936.94
I wouldn't be surprised

1937.399 --> 1941.6789999999999
Alexis is lazy dude very nice

1944.779 --> 1948.399
but he's a bit of a leprechaun

1958.159 --> 1963.919
I do think he's funny though but he goes

1961.58 --> 1966.1589999999999
very far and he's kind of crazy like

1963.919 --> 1966.159
that

1977.24 --> 1979.72
right

1980.419 --> 1986.1200000000001
why do you think Jeff took the vid down

1983.2 --> 1989.2
well probably because he recognized that

1986.12 --> 1989.1999999999998
it was going too far

1991.82 --> 1996.32
right do you have to realize they do it

1994.279 --> 1997.82
live

1996.32 --> 1999.98
and when you're doing it live and

1997.82 --> 2002.74
somebody goes too far you kind of have

1999.98 --> 2005.08
to roll with it or it's going to be a

2002.74 --> 2007.179
certain confrontation and then the guy

2005.08 --> 2010.1789999999999
when they go too far they're probably

2007.179 --> 2013.24
under some kind of attention

2010.179 --> 2017.2
that could turn like into a real serious

2013.24 --> 2019.179
live out of control fight so you have to

2017.2 --> 2021.7
kind of tactically just go along with it

2019.179 --> 2023.3200000000002
does it mean that they really agree with

2021.7 --> 2028.059
it

2023.32 --> 2029.799
but that's like the hazard of life

2028.059 --> 2033.84
streaming

2029.799 --> 2033.84
or live radio you know

2047.08 --> 2053.46
the first half was pure garbage

2050.139 --> 2053.46
okay well

2053.98 --> 2059.079
we get it George Sanford you're really

2056.579 --> 2062.579
outraged by it it was really really

2059.079 --> 2062.579
terrible we get it

2069.46 --> 2074.2200000000003
baby truth has always been awful

2074.8 --> 2079.3790000000004
yeah well I yeah

2081.879 --> 2088.899
I haven't really watched it

2085.48 --> 2092.339
like looked at Parts never really

2088.899 --> 2092.339
appealed to me on a high level

2097.72 --> 2102.8999999999996
I think there's probably been some good

2099.76 --> 2102.9
moments here and there but

2110.2 --> 2115.54
very amateur on there but well

2112.96 --> 2118.7400000000002
are you say um

2115.54 --> 2118.74
what does that mean

2121.54 --> 2129.04
like are they professional

2125.22 --> 2131.56
videographers and all that like are they

2129.04 --> 2133.859
or are they actually amateurs that have

2131.56 --> 2133.859
just

2134.079 --> 2136.92
done a lot

2138.82 --> 2142.78
you have to think about that

2141.099 --> 2146.619
like are they

2142.78 --> 2148.48
actual Professionals for what they do

2146.619 --> 2154.26
or are they just

2148.48 --> 2154.26
yeah amateurs that have gone up very far

2156.28 --> 2162.099
invested a lot

2159.099 --> 2162.099
improvisingly

2180.88 --> 2185.6800000000003
all right

2182.74 --> 2189.5989999999997
oh look dude

2185.68 --> 2189.5989999999997
I don't know what to do with this

2191.2 --> 2195.64
all right I can't make them perform

2193.9 --> 2199.0
better

2195.64 --> 2200.92
they're just doing what they're doing

2199.0 --> 2203.26
I don't know maybe they're dealing with

2200.92 --> 2205.2400000000002
a crowd of people or their friends

2203.26 --> 2208.78
circle that kind of

2205.24 --> 2211.4799999999996
like that [ __ ] maybe they've got like ah

2208.78 --> 2213.099
come on can you do more [ __ ] talking

2211.48 --> 2215.44
we like that

2213.099 --> 2218.4
I don't know man

2215.44 --> 2218.4
I don't know

2229.66 --> 2233.339
hello unicorn laser eyes

2242.56 --> 2246.9
I mean they are immature oh okay

2249.76 --> 2254.2200000000003
I'm pretty sure there's a market for

2251.8 --> 2254.2200000000003
that too

2258.16 --> 2262.359
I mean there's a

2260.2 --> 2264.22
a big horde of people out there that

2262.359 --> 2267.8199999999997
don't like

2264.22 --> 2269.7999999999997
having to be so mature and like face

2267.82 --> 2272.619
this evil

2269.8 --> 2276.94
out there that systematic robotic evil

2272.619 --> 2278.92
and twisted craziness

2276.94 --> 2281.92
and the lies

2278.92 --> 2284.2000000000003
and then an escape is like oh let's just

2281.92 --> 2285.76
get completely over the top silly like

2284.2 --> 2287.7999999999997
we're kids again and it doesn't matter

2285.76 --> 2290.1400000000003
so we can forget about all that for a

2287.8 --> 2293.82
moment right there's a market for that

2290.14 --> 2293.8199999999997
maybe they're trying to

2294.339 --> 2297.7799999999997
go more in that direction

2297.94 --> 2303.28
I mean it's not recommendable because

2301.24 --> 2304.54
things get very scattered when you do

2303.28 --> 2307.6800000000003
that

2304.54 --> 2311.64
and you can numb yourself down because

2307.68 --> 2311.64
yeah that's the point

2316.96 --> 2322.7400000000002
a huge market for atheism which is for

2319.72 --> 2322.74
yeah good point

2324.4 --> 2329.52
yeah atheism yeah Will typically

2329.619 --> 2332.2200000000003
do that

2334.3 --> 2341.04
during the only smart one okay that's

2337.18 --> 2341.04
quite a statement Jeff gashead

2345.88 --> 2351.3
what makes you say that the other guys

2348.22 --> 2351.2999999999997
are actually dumb

2366.16 --> 2370.48
I I don't want to continue like I don't

2368.32 --> 2375.2400000000002
like this conversation like I don't

2370.48 --> 2375.2400000000002
wanna like what is this what's the

2378.46 --> 2384.88
like I don't want to like start to like

2380.94 --> 2387.52
basically [ __ ] on these guys right

2384.88 --> 2389.92
a lot of what they do is experimental it

2387.52 --> 2392.44
comes with hazards I've already analyzed

2389.92 --> 2395.44
this I don't see the point of just

2392.44 --> 2398.2000000000003
endlessly complaining about this you

2395.44 --> 2400.3
know remember the concept if you don't

2398.2 --> 2404.0989999999997
like a show or you don't like it anymore

2400.3 --> 2404.099
you stop watching it

2404.5 --> 2408.06
you stop talking about it

2413.68 --> 2418.3799999999997
the Netflix propaganda still has yeah

2419.38 --> 2424.6800000000003
yeah numpties will never run out for

2421.66 --> 2424.68
them because they did that

2440.319 --> 2446.099
okay George Sanford

2442.66 --> 2446.0989999999997
yeah we get it

2463.359 --> 2468.5989999999997
what

2465.64 --> 2468.5989999999997
what are you talking

2468.7 --> 2474.339
Jaren said why does this home have two

2471.52 --> 2475.96
different camera views maybe it was

2474.339 --> 2478.68
staged

2475.96 --> 2478.68
right

2481.859 --> 2486.4
maybe it was

2484.18 --> 2487.8999999999996
maybe it was like a crisis act or

2486.4 --> 2490.1800000000003
something

2487.9 --> 2491.8
maybe it wasn't

2490.18 --> 2494.02
I don't know

2491.8 --> 2496.1800000000003
it is kind of weird though to like in

2494.02 --> 2499.74
your home have different cameras that

2496.18 --> 2499.74
seems kind of paranoia

2513.22 --> 2520.0
I mean in your store yeah of course

2516.46 --> 2522.579
right even for insurance purposes and

2520.0 --> 2525.72
all that but like in your home

2522.579 --> 2525.7200000000003
that is a bit weird

2526.66 --> 2531.04
like maybe at your front door or

2529.06 --> 2533.7999999999997
something but

2531.04 --> 2535.7799999999997
in your house hmm

2533.8 --> 2538.1800000000003
well maybe

2535.78 --> 2540.76
like somebody was like

2538.18 --> 2542.74
sneaking out cookies from the cookie jar

2540.76 --> 2547.119
or something

2542.74 --> 2548.7999999999997
that's the reason why because it's still

2547.119 --> 2552.359
very odd

2548.8 --> 2552.3590000000004
so yeah maybe he had a point

2568.9 --> 2572.5
huh

2570.579 --> 2575.28
okay

2572.5 --> 2575.28
weird

2576.7 --> 2582.1189999999997
that's from X-Files right

2578.92 --> 2582.119
old house Red Barn

2603.22 --> 2607.02
okay George Sanford

2621.88 --> 2627.4
Simpson oh the Simpson oh

2625.96 --> 2630.46
right

2627.4 --> 2633.1800000000003
yeah I mixed them up

2630.46 --> 2633.18
Simpsons

2634.119 --> 2636.78
uh

2651.819 --> 2657.06
I I don't know why you guys

2654.42 --> 2660.94
continually keep on just

2657.06 --> 2661.7799999999997
dragging on with this whining about them

2660.94 --> 2665.44
and

2661.78 --> 2667.92
like what are you all now going

2665.44 --> 2667.92
foreign

2669.099 --> 2674.38
are you all going full RV or something

2671.859 --> 2676.48
because it it is starting to sound like

2674.38 --> 2680.94
this it's just so negative could you

2676.48 --> 2680.94
please stop complaining about it

2686.5 --> 2688.98
uh

2694.72 --> 2700.359
right

2696.88 --> 2702.52
what what would work is

2700.359 --> 2705.0
if we just open a can with a different

2702.52 --> 2705.0
subject

2706.78 --> 2712.8590000000004
I've been trending on yeah well [ __ ]

2709.0 --> 2712.859
that who gives a [ __ ]

2714.46 --> 2717.3
trending

2718.3 --> 2722.819
you mean everybody's whining and

2719.92 --> 2722.819
complaining about it

2770.02 --> 2776.04
yeah well what question mark so are you

2773.56 --> 2776.04
right now

2776.859 --> 2781.72
you've just spent an hour babbling and

2779.74 --> 2785.04
gossiping

2781.72 --> 2785.04
that's what you are doing

2799.2 --> 2804.22
the con hoax what

2821.8 --> 2824.76
oh

2848.31 --> 2851.389
[Music]

2857.44 --> 2865.8
the great reset is a huge topic

2862.24 --> 2865.7999999999997
yes I'm sure it is

2868.48 --> 2873.76
yeah what's the great numpty reset oh

2871.3 --> 2876.3390000000004
it's everybody that just wastes their

2873.76 --> 2879.8190000000004
time with Petty stupid behavior and

2876.339 --> 2882.099
silly obsessions that when resolve don't

2879.819 --> 2884.64
actually lead to anything or any

2882.099 --> 2884.6400000000003
Improvement

2884.92 --> 2891.46
that they are gonna reset

2888.579 --> 2894.1600000000003
that behavior after realizing how much

2891.46 --> 2897.579
they're actually wasting their time

2894.16 --> 2900.46
and focusing on the wrong things

2897.579 --> 2902.6800000000003
it's like a spiritual reset the great

2900.46 --> 2906.3
numpty reset all these people that are

2902.68 --> 2906.2999999999997
showing numpty Behavior

2907.48 --> 2912.819
zap you out of it

2910.119 --> 2914.2000000000003
and then remember like what's what

2912.819 --> 2918.3
you're supposed to be doing actually

2914.2 --> 2918.2999999999997
with your life and your talents

2919.119 --> 2925.559
that's the great numpty reset

2921.64 --> 2925.5589999999997
it's also known as The Awakening

2926.26 --> 2929.099
foreign

2943.96 --> 2947.4
that is so silly

2949.619 --> 2955.6800000000003
Mr sensible made a new video debunking

2953.5 --> 2958.319
The Sexton

2955.68 --> 2961.72
Sexton Sextant

2958.319 --> 2964.72
a and t

2961.72 --> 2969.4199999999996
with this new attachment called the

2964.72 --> 2969.4199999999996
bubble Sexton what

2970.42 --> 2976.059
we don't need the horizon

2973.78 --> 2978.599
uh

2976.059 --> 2978.599
what

2990.099 --> 2997.92
no I haven't seen that that sounds

2993.579 --> 2997.92
like a quite the machination

3006.119 --> 3011.119
from the level bubble line oh

3012.72 --> 3018.66
right well yeah that's so that that's a

3017.16 --> 3021.839
good point

3018.66 --> 3026.42
what he's probably done is just

3021.839 --> 3026.42
call The Horizon something else

3027.42 --> 3033.8
it's just like no it's something else

3029.7 --> 3033.7999999999997
that's pretty equivalent to the horizon

3034.92 --> 3041.339
that's it this is just not calling it

3038.339 --> 3042.599
The Horizon anymore

3041.339 --> 3044.5789999999997
uh

3042.599 --> 3047.099
it's going after Mitchell

3044.579 --> 3049.38
yeah yeah oh Mitchell's going after

3047.099 --> 3052.52
others as well

3049.38 --> 3052.52
he's going at it

3067.38 --> 3071.6400000000003
all you need is level for sex and not if

3070.44 --> 3075.0
you

3071.64 --> 3079.52
varying Horizon yeah that's a good point

3075.0 --> 3079.52
with a yeah with a bubble level

3083.04 --> 3088.7599999999998
yeah geometrically though that still

3085.38 --> 3088.76
doesn't work out on a sphere

3089.52 --> 3092.42
unfortunately

3096.18 --> 3102.5989999999997
because of like basically the the

3099.319 --> 3106.02
celestial view on a ball

3102.599 --> 3108.3
if it is as presupposed

3106.02 --> 3113.24
that's really the problem that's why

3108.3 --> 3113.2400000000002
when they show you the side view diagram

3113.4 --> 3120.14
it's calculated from the center of Earth

3116.88 --> 3120.1400000000003
not from the viewer

3121.38 --> 3126.78
that's the mechanical problem

3124.319 --> 3131.3
like the stars and all that aren't where

3126.78 --> 3131.3
they're supposed to be on the sphere

3171.02 --> 3176.3
oh for sure less key rizzling

3177.18 --> 3180.02
foreign

3198.38 --> 3203.579
I've argued for that myself all you have

3201.599 --> 3205.6800000000003
to do is just apply terrestrial

3203.579 --> 3208.92
refraction

3205.68 --> 3212.339
and then you can just use the

3208.92 --> 3215.64
the flat reality and then imagine how

3212.339 --> 3218.119
that's visually being bent and all just

3215.64 --> 3218.1189999999997
works out

3236.16 --> 3240.66
now of course the Assumption of

3237.96 --> 3242.7
terrestrial refractions brings enormous

3240.66 --> 3244.7999999999997
implications

3242.7 --> 3247.3799999999997
but you don't have to worry about that

3244.8 --> 3250.319
as long as the end result brings you at

3247.38 --> 3252.1800000000003
the places that the maps are pointing at

3250.319 --> 3254.94
right

3252.18 --> 3257.94
so yeah you can presuppose things are

3254.94 --> 3260.52
not where you see them to be exactly

3257.94 --> 3261.7200000000003
as long as yeah you end up in the right

3260.52 --> 3264.9
spot

3261.72 --> 3267.24
right you can imagine the most crazy

3264.9 --> 3268.859
things ever you can imagine that beyond

3267.24 --> 3271.14
your site there is no more physical

3268.859 --> 3273.839
reality

3271.14 --> 3276.1189999999997
literally that it's all physically

3273.839 --> 3278.7599999999998
manifests around your conscious

3276.119 --> 3280.92
observation

3278.76 --> 3283.38
as yeah if you do that in the process

3280.92 --> 3286.319
and twist some calculations like to the

3283.38 --> 3290.04
edge of existence and all that as long

3286.319 --> 3292.5589999999997
as you're using it and you still end up

3290.04 --> 3294.0
on the right location on the map

3292.559 --> 3296.1600000000003
yeah

3294.0 --> 3300.14
it doesn't matter what kind of crazy

3296.16 --> 3300.14
things you imagine in between

3300.54 --> 3305.54
right because that becomes superfluous

3305.88 --> 3310.5
so

3307.44 --> 3312.299
you just use it on a flat plane and then

3310.5 --> 3316.14
you can imagine

3312.299 --> 3319.68
all kinds of reasons why

3316.14 --> 3322.4
it appears to be not exactly as how you

3319.68 --> 3322.3999999999996
want it to be

3329.96 --> 3337.04
using level instead of horizon avoids

3332.94 --> 3337.04
refraction no it doesn't really

3372.9 --> 3380.359
yeah it's still look it doesn't matter

3375.839 --> 3380.359
if he's able to exclude the horizon

3382.559 --> 3387.78
you don't see what you're supposed to

3385.2 --> 3391.64
see on the globe

3387.78 --> 3391.6400000000003
like the Earth Is Not underneath

3391.68 --> 3395.4199999999996
a

3393.119 --> 3398.099
a set of stars in the vast distance

3395.42 --> 3401.339
because it doesn't pan out like that

3398.099 --> 3404.059
really like it's visually not looking

3401.339 --> 3404.0589999999997
like that

3405.24 --> 3411.8999999999996
like if it would be

3408.839 --> 3414.599
you would never at any point on Earth be

3411.9 --> 3418.2000000000003
able to see in one site

3414.599 --> 3421.079
the apparent northern and southern

3418.2 --> 3422.3999999999996
rotation of the celestial sphere in the

3421.079 --> 3424.38
same view

3422.4 --> 3427.26
that would be absolutely impossible

3424.38 --> 3430.339
geometrically

3427.26 --> 3430.3390000000004
yet we do

3438.78 --> 3444.299
oh yeah besides have you ever tried to

3441.24 --> 3446.3999999999996
actually use a water level on a on a

3444.299 --> 3450.2599999999998
moving ship

3446.4 --> 3450.26
that's gonna be quite the hassle

3450.299 --> 3453.619
have you ever tried that

3458.4 --> 3462.54
you're gonna have to like use a gyro

3460.619 --> 3464.099
suspension

3462.54 --> 3466.5589999999997
thing

3464.099 --> 3468.6600000000003
to keep it still in relation to the

3466.559 --> 3471.6600000000003
moving ship that's like a huge Hazard

3468.66 --> 3475.0789999999997
right now if you're holding a thing

3471.66 --> 3478.8799999999997
then your body's auto correction is

3475.079 --> 3478.88
going to make it a lot more reliable

3481.26 --> 3487.0200000000004
then if you

3483.48 --> 3488.04
had to hold a water level perfectly

3487.02 --> 3491.94
still

3488.04 --> 3493.859
like you'd have to constantly look down

3491.94 --> 3495.839
to see if the bubbles in the right

3493.859 --> 3499.819
that's like no way

3495.839 --> 3499.819
that's undoable at sea

3518.24 --> 3525.4799999999996
so yeah this supposed sextance with a

3521.94 --> 3528.299
with the water level in it that's not

3525.48 --> 3531.299
something I guarantee that did not exist

3528.299 --> 3534.14
during the exploration

3531.299 --> 3534.14
there's no way

3536.16 --> 3541.2799999999997
because that's extremely impractical

3538.26 --> 3541.28
when you're at sea

3547.26 --> 3555.119
like water levels are great when you're

3550.5 --> 3559.52
on land right because the land is still

3555.119 --> 3559.52
about on the sea not still

3568.02 --> 3573.68
I mean might be still sometimes if

3570.78 --> 3573.6800000000003
you're really lucky

3575.28 --> 3580.44
but like in the deep ocean it's never

3577.799 --> 3582.74
really like super super still that's

3580.44 --> 3582.7400000000002
just

3583.38 --> 3586.579
that's really rare

3609.24 --> 3616.74
it can be calm yes I know it can be

3613.26 --> 3619.8590000000004
but it often isn't

3616.74 --> 3621.359
it's much in my cases it's much easier

3619.859 --> 3623.7599999999998
to actually

3621.359 --> 3625.2599999999998
make your head and your back and all

3623.76 --> 3629.3390000000004
that a tune

3625.26 --> 3632.46
adapt to the motion of the ship

3629.339 --> 3634.74
and keep your eyes still focused on the

3632.46 --> 3638.04
horizon using the sex and that's easier

3634.74 --> 3639.319
to do on a moving ship way easier

3638.04 --> 3643.02
than

3639.319 --> 3645.839
using a bubble and then because you have

3643.02 --> 3648.66
to look at the freaking bubble to keep

3645.839 --> 3649.859
it that's you can't look at the freaking

3648.66 --> 3653.16
bubble

3649.859 --> 3656.16
if it's perfectly still and at the

3653.16 --> 3659.18
celestials that doesn't make any sense

3656.16 --> 3659.18
that's ridiculous

3659.46 --> 3666.2400000000002
that would only work on land

3662.579 --> 3669.319
that I'm just being practical here

3666.24 --> 3669.319
this is ridiculous

3674.94 --> 3679.46
you don't use a water level at sea

3681.299 --> 3685.5
right and that's also why you don't

3684.119 --> 3687.54
build

3685.5 --> 3689.52
the ship

3687.54 --> 3693.96
on sea

3689.52 --> 3696.299
you build it on land on a dock

3693.96 --> 3698.64
and then you can use the water level

3696.299 --> 3701.64
because you're on land stationary you

3698.64 --> 3704.16
can actually use it to be exact in your

3701.64 --> 3705.9
measurements and all that you can't

3704.16 --> 3709.98
build a ship

3705.9 --> 3714.1800000000003
on sea like as it is floating you're not

3709.98 --> 3716.7
gonna build it from scratch on the sea

3714.18 --> 3719.0989999999997
because then you can't use a water level

3716.7 --> 3721.74
it's going to be a hazard

3719.099 --> 3725.52
when you design a thing right maybe if

3721.74 --> 3728.8799999999997
it's just assembly right or prefab parts

3725.52 --> 3731.46
it might be doable but like the old

3728.88 --> 3734.28
style like building Wooden Ships and all

3731.46 --> 3736.68
that they did that [ __ ] by hand it was

3734.28 --> 3739.7400000000002
all handcrafted

3736.68 --> 3742.2799999999997
you can't do that if the whole thing is

3739.74 --> 3742.2799999999997
moving

3744.059 --> 3751.52
a water level doesn't work on C it's

3748.799 --> 3751.52
impractical

3752.4 --> 3757.14
watch the video then you will understand

3754.74 --> 3760.25
yeah sure

3757.14 --> 3760.25
[Music]

3761.22 --> 3768.0589999999997
I bet it didn't have a demonstration of

3764.52 --> 3772.099
using that thing on a boat did it

3768.059 --> 3772.099
like on an actual like Wooden Boat

3781.559 --> 3785.46
because you have to be still

3783.359 --> 3787.319
you have to be still in order to first

3785.46 --> 3791.18
check is the Bobble at the right place

3787.319 --> 3791.18
and then it has to stay like that

3791.64 --> 3795.359
you have to know it stays like that if

3793.619 --> 3797.539
you're on a moving boat it's gonna move

3795.359 --> 3797.5389999999998
about

3797.579 --> 3802.44
you constantly have to keep watching at

3799.619 --> 3804.119
it it only works on land to check is it

3802.44 --> 3806.339
level

3804.119 --> 3808.799
and then you know okay it's now level

3806.339 --> 3810.359
it's not going to change because Earth

3808.799 --> 3812.22
is stationary

3810.359 --> 3814.68
it's not going to move the Earth is not

3812.22 --> 3817.2
gonna change my orientation because I'm

3814.68 --> 3819.7799999999997
not floating on water

3817.2 --> 3821.9399999999996
and then you can look up through the the

3819.78 --> 3824.099
rest of the section mechanism because

3821.94 --> 3826.5
you can rely on that it's going to stay

3824.099 --> 3828.839
in its spot on the sea it's going to

3826.5 --> 3831.18
keep on moving around and you constantly

3828.839 --> 3832.5
have to recheck like look down is it in

3831.18 --> 3835.46
the right spot is it

3832.5 --> 3835.46
ridiculous

3842.94 --> 3849.7200000000003
bubble sextants

3845.039 --> 3851.76
can only function as land instruments

3849.72 --> 3853.98
I mean it might work like really well

3851.76 --> 3855.96
when you're inside of a valley

3853.98 --> 3858.18
surrounded by mountains and you don't

3855.96 --> 3859.7400000000002
get to see the real like the normal

3858.18 --> 3862.799
Horizon

3859.74 --> 3865.0789999999997
so then yeah bubble Saxon would be great

3862.799 --> 3867.059
because you can just

3865.079 --> 3869.96
Jack if it's perfectly level and then

3867.059 --> 3869.96
you use it like that

3870.539 --> 3874.7400000000002
right so yeah a land instrument

3873.359 --> 3878.119
would work great

3874.74 --> 3878.1189999999997
doesn't work on the ocean

3897.599 --> 3902.2200000000003
must have used water as a level in the

3900.72 --> 3905.4599999999996
cryptoof for sure

3902.22 --> 3908.0589999999997
for sure Jeff gashead and more and other

3905.46 --> 3908.059
things too

3909.839 --> 3916.68
but yeah

3912.119 --> 3920.1600000000003
the water level is quite useful in just

3916.68 --> 3924.3799999999997
any form of architecture

3920.16 --> 3924.3799999999997
it's like an architecture tool typically

3931.38 --> 3935.9
right it's like the follow-up of the

3933.66 --> 3935.8999999999996
plum

3936.42 --> 3940.2200000000003
which is just a pendulum

3959.96 --> 3966.619
what grade did you get to in school

3963.78 --> 3966.619
uh

3966.66 --> 3972.0789999999997
I did get my diploma

3969.18 --> 3972.0789999999997
after it

3976.079 --> 3979.039
but yeah

3982.079 --> 3987.42
but I learned a lot more after school

3984.539 --> 3989.2200000000003
and outside of school than I did even in

3987.42 --> 3992.2400000000002
school

3989.22 --> 3992.24
hearing out people

3998.22 --> 4002.98
for a long time I actually wanted to

4000.14 --> 4002.98
become an architect

4015.5 --> 4020.119
oh

4017.299 --> 4023.299
that was meant for the right well see

4020.119 --> 4025.52
see the advantage I didn't know

4023.299 --> 4027.16
but yeah I didn't fall out at you like

4025.52 --> 4029.72
how dare you and then it wasn't

4027.16 --> 4032.5389999999998
addressed at me so no damage done right

4029.72 --> 4034.22
I just answered the question

4032.539 --> 4037.7200000000003
even though it was addressed to somebody

4034.22 --> 4037.72
else see that works

4040.7 --> 4045.9199999999996
that way even when you make a mistake

4043.339 --> 4049.0389999999998
you still do something right

4045.92 --> 4050.48
you don't make it worse

4049.039 --> 4054.5200000000004
because of

4050.48 --> 4054.52
like systematic approach anyway

4059.78 --> 4063.52
what are you talking about

4076.64 --> 4083.92
hmm

4079.64 --> 4083.92
right come on uh

4086.599 --> 4092.5
dude what maybe chill out for a bit

4096.02 --> 4102.219
yeah he's a glober that's kind of stupid

4098.48 --> 4106.48
we get it you don't have to be so

4102.219 --> 4106.4800000000005
outspoken about it like that dude

4108.739 --> 4112.639999999999
I think that person probably already

4110.719 --> 4115.42
knows has heard all it is just gonna

4112.64 --> 4115.42
ignore it anyway

4120.819 --> 4127.179
evolutionism it's idolatry

4124.64 --> 4127.179
what

4130.64 --> 4133.299
how

4135.5 --> 4139.239
what is being worshiped

4148.6 --> 4153.14
serving the creature no

4151.94 --> 4155.5
what

4153.14 --> 4155.5
how

4171.56 --> 4174.52
humanism

4177.08 --> 4184.159
I don't know man look when you basically

4180.199 --> 4186.678999999999
take God and all that out of the picture

4184.159 --> 4188.839
using atheism and the typical structures

4186.679 --> 4190.759
that came from it

4188.839 --> 4193.1
yeah you started

4190.759 --> 4195.08
dude there's technically there's people

4193.1 --> 4199.34
out there that'll just start to freaking

4195.08 --> 4200.54
worship whatever when they feel like it

4199.34 --> 4203.96
so

4200.54 --> 4207.62
yeah you can get into idolatry right

4203.96 --> 4209.54
what is actually very common

4207.62 --> 4213.5
I don't know if it's still that common

4209.54 --> 4216.199
but it I had issues with it

4213.5 --> 4219.32
instead yeah you start for example you

4216.199 --> 4222.739
worship the person you're in love with

4219.32 --> 4226.04
because you don't have any

4222.739 --> 4228.199
reflu yeah useful way to deal with it

4226.04 --> 4229.76
and don't realize what it is and then

4228.199 --> 4233.678999999999
you just get pulled in and then you

4229.76 --> 4233.679
basically start to obsess in that way

4235.28 --> 4241.159
because you don't have the insight about

4238.52 --> 4244.34
what it is you're actually doing

4241.159 --> 4247.9
that's normal but that's not like

4244.34 --> 4247.900000000001
Evolution itself

4248.179 --> 4252.14
it's just

4250.1 --> 4257.0
God having been taken out of the picture

4252.14 --> 4260.06
you don't realize those logos rules

4257.0 --> 4262.52
design rules you don't realize that and

4260.06 --> 4265.659000000001
then you just stumble upon it and

4262.52 --> 4265.659000000001
there's nothing to stop you

4265.76 --> 4270.7390000000005
but it's not the worship of evolution

4269.06 --> 4276.8
itself

4270.739 --> 4276.799999999999
evolution is just the virtual system

4277.52 --> 4282.02
of how it's supposed to be working how

4280.219 --> 4284.6
it's supposed to have progressed over

4282.02 --> 4286.820000000001
time that's it

4284.6 --> 4290.92
it's not worshiped

4286.82 --> 4290.92
and no creature is worshiped

4291.199 --> 4296.659
I mean people might well idolize

4294.32 --> 4298.4
something again that they love for

4296.659 --> 4301.9
example they're like oh I really love

4298.4 --> 4301.9
these animals and then you're like

4303.26 --> 4310.52
basic fandom

4306.08 --> 4310.5199999999995
is basic fandom idolatry

4311.659 --> 4316.839999999999
right who isn't a fan of something at

4314.54 --> 4316.84
some point

4318.08 --> 4323.719
it all depends

4320.6 --> 4327.400000000001
do you let it take you too far

4323.719 --> 4327.4
do you still think that's okay

4331.58 --> 4335.14
it's just worldview no

4338.78 --> 4345.92
no it's a it's a concept

4342.62 --> 4347.96
it's not a religious no

4345.92 --> 4349.82
religion

4347.96 --> 4353.42
like

4349.82 --> 4355.4
gives you actions to do evolution is

4353.42 --> 4357.62
just like this is how it's how it's

4355.4 --> 4360.98
supposed to have worked

4357.62 --> 4363.38
right but just the belief in evolution

4360.98 --> 4366.379999999999
being how it's supposed to have built up

4363.38 --> 4367.9400000000005
doesn't automatically make you like a

4366.38 --> 4372.14
darwinist

4367.94 --> 4373.94
like oh we have to fit the the survival

4372.14 --> 4376.52
of the strongest we have to kill the

4373.94 --> 4380.178999999999
weak links for the species that doesn't

4376.52 --> 4384.1
automatically flow out of that

4380.179 --> 4384.1
that's kind of separate

4386.239 --> 4391.339999999999
that's people you don't get forced into

4389.36 --> 4394.12
that sort of thinking that's like a

4391.34 --> 4394.12
personal choice

4397.82 --> 4401.739
dude I don't even know what you're

4399.26 --> 4401.7390000000005
saying anymore

4402.199 --> 4406.178999999999
they're calling all kinds of things

4403.4 --> 4406.179
idolatry

4413.719 --> 4418.0
I think it's a bit out of context dude

4419.36 --> 4421.54
foreign

4424.82 --> 4430.0599999999995
movie stars are called Yeah well yeah

4430.4 --> 4437.799999999999
but that is kind of idolatry

4434.659 --> 4437.799999999999
the movie stars

4438.92 --> 4442.82
they're people

4440.84 --> 4446.42
and they're

4442.82 --> 4449.48
being portrayed in amazing and even

4446.42 --> 4452.06
Supernatural ways and then people

4449.48 --> 4457.178999999999
latch onto that they fall in love with

4452.06 --> 4457.179
it they project on it they try to

4458.06 --> 4463.1
grow themselves arrange themselves in

4461.179 --> 4464.84
their in that image

4463.1 --> 4465.9800000000005
because they want to be like that in

4464.84 --> 4468.1990000000005
some way

4465.98 --> 4469.159
yeah that could be considered idolatry

4468.199 --> 4472.82
but

4469.159 --> 4474.92
it is actually it's kind of yeah

4472.82 --> 4476.659
but this even can just happen with

4474.92 --> 4478.9400000000005
people around you in your Social Circle

4476.659 --> 4481.879999999999
like there could be just some

4478.94 --> 4485.78
man or woman that's like really radiant

4481.88 --> 4488.0
or beautiful or like we just

4485.78 --> 4489.259999999999
everything is right

4488.0 --> 4491.78
to you

4489.26 --> 4495.08
and then you like kind of like whoa dude

4491.78 --> 4497.9
I want to be like that that's also

4495.08 --> 4500.84
a bit of idolatry but it's yeah that's

4497.9 --> 4504.0199999999995
that's like the the root of it it's just

4500.84 --> 4505.76
socializing find somebody that you you

4504.02 --> 4508.580000000001
see

4505.76 --> 4511.88
is better than you in some ways

4508.58 --> 4514.219
and then you try to be like that

4511.88 --> 4516.92
or you try to take out the competition

4514.219 --> 4519.62
if you're a total gamma

4516.92 --> 4522.08
or an alpha they can do it too but they

4519.62 --> 4524.239
do it more eloquently

4522.08 --> 4526.699
they just start to show off how good

4524.239 --> 4528.0199999999995
they are

4526.699 --> 4530.299999999999
and

4528.02 --> 4533.860000000001
yeah that's just biology that's just

4530.3 --> 4533.860000000001
social behavior it's very natural

4536.96 --> 4541.58
but yeah the more conscious you become

4539.6 --> 4544.1
of all that

4541.58 --> 4546.98
then the more you will realize like yeah

4544.1 --> 4549.320000000001
that's kind of idolatry Behavior

4546.98 --> 4551.54
it's better to kind of like separate

4549.32 --> 4554.239
yourself from that

4551.54 --> 4556.58
only let it be preliminary

4554.239 --> 4560.12
and

4556.58 --> 4562.4
yeah not get obsessed

4560.12 --> 4565.12
with other people

4562.4 --> 4565.12
basically

4582.679 --> 4589.219
biology seems a Fundy religion in the

4586.46 --> 4591.8
universe dude you need to stop saying

4589.219 --> 4595.58
the word idolatry

4591.8 --> 4599.06
you're using the word idolatry like some

4595.58 --> 4601.28
people call others agents

4599.06 --> 4603.620000000001
you don't seem to really understand what

4601.28 --> 4607.239
idolatry is even though I'm explaining

4603.62 --> 4607.239
it right here on the spot

4615.38 --> 4619.3
hello Eric one one one one

4635.6 --> 4641.26
computer game Stars

4638.6 --> 4641.26
ugh

4641.54 --> 4644.92
yeah I'm sure they do

4653.08 --> 4658.58
well by the way computer game stars have

4656.179 --> 4661.78
been around for a while you know

4658.58 --> 4661.78
remember Mario

4663.08 --> 4669.08
and there's just one right and people

4665.9 --> 4672.739
dressing up and like yeah

4669.08 --> 4677.38
computer game idols that's been around

4672.739 --> 4677.379999999999
for a while like since the 80s

4678.8 --> 4684.159000000001
really really got bigger like in the 90s

4681.8 --> 4684.159000000001
but

4684.26 --> 4688.76
yeah

4686.6 --> 4691.3
that's been around my entire lifetime

4688.76 --> 4691.3
pretty much

4702.02 --> 4706.040000000001
computer game Star

4704.36 --> 4709.94
Oh you mean

4706.04 --> 4711.8
not computer figures but people that are

4709.94 --> 4714.0199999999995
stars because they're so super special

4711.8 --> 4715.9400000000005
with computer games

4714.02 --> 4718.719
like specialists

4715.94 --> 4718.719
yeah sure

4721.159 --> 4725.139999999999
I've heard it's mostly just a lot of

4723.5 --> 4728.42
Korean kids

4725.14 --> 4730.6
maybe that's racist to say that I don't

4728.42 --> 4730.6
know

4743.0 --> 4747.199
or maybe they like

4745.1 --> 4750.02
people to say that about him because

4747.199 --> 4752.659
it's probably true

4750.02 --> 4755.080000000001
there's like game competitions in there

4752.659 --> 4755.08
a lot

4757.699 --> 4761.659
like even mainstream knowledge pretty

4759.739 --> 4764.32
much anyway

4761.659 --> 4764.32
uh

4764.9 --> 4770.08
starting computer games is he is he like

4767.84 --> 4770.08
that

4772.699 --> 4777.139999999999
they did actual competitions I don't

4774.92 --> 4779.719
remember he might have

4777.14 --> 4783.14
I knew he wasn't a gay man a lot

4779.719 --> 4785.26
it's talked about that a lot since the

4783.14 --> 4785.26
beginning

4852.56 --> 4858.26
like you two are like in such a

4855.98 --> 4861.44
complainy mode it's really getting on my

4858.26 --> 4864.8
nerves seven seven seven

4861.44 --> 4867.759999999999
and George Sanford it's I don't want to

4864.8 --> 4867.76
do that now

4868.1 --> 4870.88
do you mind

4893.0 --> 4896.6
I've changed the subject well I don't

4895.52 --> 4900.46
know

4896.6 --> 4900.46
it might be just rounding out the show

4910.28 --> 4915.98
yeah wow because yeah also the weather's

4914.239 --> 4919.78
just great I kind of want to like catch

4915.98 --> 4919.78
some of that sun before it all goes down

4936.32 --> 4938.5
foreign

4951.82 --> 4955.82
yeah blatantly

4961.639 --> 4967.159000000001
I won't Benjamin did like a whole

4964.84 --> 4969.9800000000005
revisit segment

4967.159 --> 4971.12
the other day about dinosaurs and how

4969.98 --> 4976.78
like

4971.12 --> 4976.78
how ridiculous that entire SK scheme is

4977.36 --> 4983.739
like it's all yeah grind grounded up

4980.9 --> 4983.739
chicken bones

4983.96 --> 4990.86
and that this supposed real bones

4987.5 --> 4994.84
are like all radioactive and unavailable

4990.86 --> 4994.839999999999
because of ridiculous excuses

5000.04 --> 5002.46
right

5003.719 --> 5008.639
Darwin is an evolved worm not a man

5026.86 --> 5031.36
what

5028.96 --> 5034.36
are you blabbering about

5031.36 --> 5037.299999999999
Evolution was a term never even part of

5034.36 --> 5039.78
lexicon mainstream 20 years what are you

5037.3 --> 5039.78
talking about

5040.78 --> 5046.5599999999995
what it wasn't in 2001 are you [ __ ]

5044.32 --> 5046.5599999999995
me

5047.8 --> 5051.0
that's ridiculous

5052.12 --> 5059.32
yeah Evolution was definitely

5055.9 --> 5062.04
in the mainstream lexicon before 20

5059.32 --> 5062.04
years ago

5063.639 --> 5069.88
evolution is to be a word yeah but what

5066.219 --> 5073.9
you said is absolutely ridiculous

5069.88 --> 5076.12
unless you meant 200 years ago but you

5073.9 --> 5078.219
said 20 years ago pretty damn sure that

5076.12 --> 5081.099999999999
in 2001

5078.219 --> 5084.659
the term evolution was in the mainstream

5081.1 --> 5084.659000000001
lexicon what

5088.54 --> 5095.5
2001 right 911 yeah it was mainstream

5093.46 --> 5097.42
lexicon yeah yeah it has been it's been

5095.5 --> 5100.6
mainstream lexicon all my life I don't

5097.42 --> 5103.86
know what you're talking about man

5100.6 --> 5103.860000000001
you're spazzing out

5122.26 --> 5125.359
[Music]

5144.76 --> 5150.54
that what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

5148.36 --> 5150.54
about

5153.82 --> 5161.86
I mean if you're gonna talk about where

5157.54 --> 5165.219
you grew up what question mark

5161.86 --> 5168.46
where you supposedly grew up

5165.219 --> 5170.139
nobody talked about that sure I'd go for

5168.46 --> 5175.36
that perhaps

5170.139 --> 5180.04
but I used the word Evolution a lot

5175.36 --> 5183.159
I I was very interested in it as a kid

5180.04 --> 5186.04
and as a teen I I must have used that

5183.159 --> 5187.96
word in sentences like

5186.04 --> 5190.96
thousands of times

5187.96 --> 5194.58
so it's pure [ __ ]

5190.96 --> 5194.58
you're talking [ __ ]

5207.699 --> 5212.08
oh so now it was pushed heavily

5209.98 --> 5216.699
immediate well I guarantee you it was

5212.08 --> 5216.699
pushed heavily in media before 2001.

5217.179 --> 5221.9800000000005
okay I'm gonna just time you out now

5220.239 --> 5224.259999999999
you're squirting it's getting really on

5221.98 --> 5227.638999999999
my nerves dude

5224.26 --> 5227.639
you don't correct anything

5227.92 --> 5232.86
you're just spamming now I'm done with

5230.679 --> 5232.86
it

5249.88 --> 5252.06
foreign

5261.46 --> 5267.78
pretty sure that like Evolution was in

5264.159 --> 5267.78
standard textbooks since

5268.36 --> 5274.38
textbooks

5271.239 --> 5279.04
since they did it since the dinosaur

5274.38 --> 5281.400000000001
museum ship what is it 19th century most

5279.04 --> 5281.4
of it

5281.739 --> 5286.379999999999
when standardized education and all that

5287.199 --> 5289.739
happened

5290.92 --> 5295.4800000000005
and I think that at the time when

5292.719 --> 5298.6
there's even records of this still left

5295.48 --> 5301.419999999999
and some personal testimony that in the

5298.6 --> 5304.06
early 20th century it was a highly

5301.42 --> 5306.88
debated thing as in there were schools

5304.06 --> 5308.5
they were like no that's no Christian I

5306.88 --> 5310.96
don't blame him it isn't

5308.5 --> 5313.38
we're not going to teach that in our

5310.96 --> 5313.38
schools

5313.719 --> 5319.84
but it would be suggested

5316.0 --> 5323.32
right and then yeah over the century the

5319.84 --> 5325.84
20th century then eventually

5323.32 --> 5328.36
[ __ ] happened more schools started to

5325.84 --> 5331.360000000001
adopt it and then eventually it became

5328.36 --> 5334.92
like standardized

5331.36 --> 5337.54
like really standardized and then

5334.92 --> 5339.6990000000005
mandatorized mandatory at some point

5337.54 --> 5342.28
with some places

5339.699 --> 5345.4
right but it was definitely all there

5342.28 --> 5346.96
and it was the hating newspapers talk

5345.4 --> 5349.36
about it

5346.96 --> 5351.94
but in the early 20th century there was

5349.36 --> 5355.54
also plenty of newspapers

5351.94 --> 5358.12
that would speak out against it and say

5355.54 --> 5359.8
it's ridiculous here it's like

5358.12 --> 5362.38
other studies

5359.8 --> 5364.659000000001
that would also happen

5362.38 --> 5368.04
so you're getting it just way out of

5364.659 --> 5368.04
whack here you're just squirting

5382.179 --> 5385.9
all right nothing has ever evolved into

5384.159 --> 5386.92
now that should be thrown with the

5385.9 --> 5389.86
bathwater

5386.92 --> 5393.84
or with the philosophical mistake kind

5389.86 --> 5393.839999999999
of like Newtonian gravity

5393.88 --> 5398.38
should still get a mention but yeah it

5396.34 --> 5401.219
should not be the standard it's

5398.38 --> 5404.92
ridiculous I mean they're

5401.219 --> 5409.3
adaptation is a worthwhile Pursuit

5404.92 --> 5411.88
to study because that is real and like

5409.3 --> 5414.159000000001
epigenetics and all that

5411.88 --> 5416.76
but yeah evolution is just completely

5414.159 --> 5416.759999999999
ridiculous

5440.739 --> 5443.28
right

5443.32 --> 5447.299999999999
anyway I think I'm rounding out the show

5448.12 --> 5454.42
no

5450.88 --> 5457.08
I want the sun back damn it

5454.42 --> 5457.08
uh

5457.659 --> 5463.199
yeah clear is very late

5459.94 --> 5463.199
because I'm just rounding out

5469.659 --> 5474.699
all right so yeah a big chunk for you

5472.9 --> 5477.159
haven't seen it of course clear big

5474.699 --> 5479.82
chunk of this show is people endlessly

5477.159 --> 5482.219
complaining about

5479.82 --> 5487.0
the Stream

5482.219 --> 5489.639
jiren took down because of like

5487.0 --> 5491.739
some thing that they thought was funny

5489.639 --> 5493.42
to make a joke about and then turned out

5491.739 --> 5496.239
it wasn't

5493.42 --> 5499.2390000000005
so they took it down and yeah so people

5496.239 --> 5501.58
in super complaining mode here very

5499.239 --> 5503.5599999999995
annoying

5501.58 --> 5505.96
yeah

5503.56 --> 5508.659000000001
nothing really I can do about it

5505.96 --> 5510.699
so I'm just rounding out I've been going

5560.38 --> 5564.52
of food again

5562.54 --> 5567.219
anyway

5564.52 --> 5568.7390000000005
uh I will be back tomorrow Flat Earth

5567.219 --> 5572.08
early bird number

5568.739 --> 5574.299999999999
1078 on a Monday so it's going to be 1pm

5572.08 --> 5577.84
Amsterdam time again

5574.3 --> 5581.02
hope to see you all there in chat

5577.84 --> 5583.12
and also hopefully in less of a

5581.02 --> 5586.659000000001
complaining mood and

5583.12 --> 5589.0
more about digging in good stuff

5586.659 --> 5592.239
not just complaining about bad stuff

5589.0 --> 5593.739
because that's not really productive

5592.239 --> 5596.199
in my opinion

5593.739 --> 5598.54
I mean to address it is one thing but to

5596.199 --> 5601.839999999999
then keep on complaining about it

5598.54 --> 5604.3
not productive right

5601.84 --> 5607.02
uh

5604.3 --> 5607.02
right

5607.42 --> 5611.56
yeah I hope to see you around in chats

5609.46 --> 5612.76
and hopefully I'm gonna watch that Flat
