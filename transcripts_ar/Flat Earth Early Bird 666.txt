81.28 --> 88.96000000000001
quite beautiful it's also

85.04 --> 91.43900000000001
still kind of cold it's really

88.96 --> 93.67999999999999
weird how because it looks just perfect

91.439 --> 97.439
it's such a clear

93.68 --> 97.43900000000001
perfect clear blue sky

99.04 --> 103.84
i think there's like even planes going

101.2 --> 106.399
up going around right now

103.84 --> 107.36
like one per two person planes and all

106.399 --> 109.68
that

107.36 --> 113.119
but at the same time yeah the wind is

109.68 --> 115.2
cold it's like really

113.119 --> 117.28
well it's not icy cold but it's cold

115.2 --> 120.32000000000001
enough so i i went out

117.28 --> 120.32000000000001
in like this

121.28 --> 127.6
like in shorts in my shirt but still

124.399 --> 128.0
it was doable but if you just stand

127.6 --> 130.319
still

128.0 --> 132.8
somewhere in the shadow you you totally

130.319 --> 137.11999999999998
freeze up

132.8 --> 140.64000000000001
because it is it is not that warm

137.12 --> 143.84
right but yeah in the sun

140.64 --> 143.83999999999997
it's great

144.8 --> 153.20000000000002
so i got just green tea with me today

149.76 --> 155.2
and no coffee didn't have any coffee in

153.2 --> 158.16
the morning i had to

155.2 --> 158.56
resist the temptation because i do kind

158.16 --> 161.68
of

158.56 --> 163.599
like long for it but yeah i

161.68 --> 166.56
i've been drinking for coffee for two

163.599 --> 169.67999999999998
days again and since then

166.56 --> 172.0
like the jaw cramps started coming back

169.68 --> 173.76000000000002
like especially yesterday night even if

172.0 --> 174.64
i only had one freaking coffee in the

173.76 --> 177.84
morning

174.64 --> 178.64
i felt it pretty severely so i i just

177.84 --> 182.8
have to quit

178.64 --> 187.83999999999997
for now even though i do have coffee

182.8 --> 190.48000000000002
i'm just gonna have to i don't know

187.84 --> 191.519
not drink coffee for a week or something

190.48 --> 194.959
and then hopefully

191.519 --> 196.4
it'll like really stop that would be

194.959 --> 198.64000000000001
great

196.4 --> 200.48000000000002
or maybe now i just have this problem

198.64 --> 203.27999999999997
permanently that every time i start to

200.48 --> 207.44
drink coffee i start to get this

203.28 --> 207.44
all year long i don't know maybe this is

208.879 --> 212.0
something like that i don't hope so i

210.879 --> 215.35999999999999
don't hope this is an

212.0 --> 218.239
aging thing probably not it's probably

215.36 --> 221.04000000000002
an after summer thing

218.239 --> 221.36
right so anyway let's see who's in chat

221.04 --> 224.07999999999998
good

221.36 --> 225.12
servant was first brent m good to see

224.08 --> 228.799
you

225.12 --> 233.599
ajm martin tolberg

228.799 --> 233.59900000000002
yeah good to see you so far awake souls

233.68 --> 241.59900000000002
hey ah that's

237.28 --> 243.76
but was it yeah that was the name

241.599 --> 246.159
that i kind of forgot a year ago that's

243.76 --> 246.159
the guy

247.12 --> 252.48000000000002
i don't know if this is actually him

250.879 --> 254.159
probably not i think i banned him but

252.48 --> 257.84
i'm not sure

254.159 --> 261.03999999999996
but yeah it is a very special show

257.84 --> 262.96
because yeah i'm at two-thirds

261.04 --> 265.44
of a thousand episodes isn't that just

262.96 --> 265.44
special

266.84 --> 269.84
right

272.88 --> 275.199
ah

278.0 --> 284.88
steve where's steve

281.199 --> 284.88
oh right good servant steve

290.4 --> 296.56
remember because there's also just a

294.0 --> 299.04
a visitor called steve because i haven't

296.56 --> 304.32
seen him in a while though

299.04 --> 304.32
well abt 2012 hello

308.34 --> 313.52
[Music]

309.6 --> 316.639
all right so yeah

313.52 --> 317.12
as i said like way back a couple of

316.639 --> 320.479
weeks

317.12 --> 323.28000000000003
ago i'm not gonna do anything special

320.479 --> 325.75899999999996
for this episode

323.28 --> 327.67999999999995
you know everybody would probably i'm

325.759 --> 331.759
not going to

327.68 --> 331.759
because it just makes me feel stupid

332.88 --> 339.84
because i don't really believe in it

336.24 --> 339.84000000000003
like that anyway

340.479 --> 346.88
and yeah why would i

343.6 --> 349.68
somehow celebrate something like that

346.88 --> 350.56
i don't celebrate anything as else

349.68 --> 353.199
really

350.56 --> 354.08
special i just don't get that gimmicky

353.199 --> 357.84000000000003
on my show

354.08 --> 367.84
unless i just spontaneously feel like it

357.84 --> 367.84
and then i do

375.68 --> 395.84000000000003
what philip what are you talking about

406.639 --> 412.639
now awake souls is a

409.84 --> 413.75899999999996
he's kind of a weirdo to be fair i did

412.639 --> 416.8
but i don't know if it

413.759 --> 419.44
is literally him could be

416.8 --> 420.8
but anyway he knows he's a weirdo and if

419.44 --> 424.08
he doesn't then

420.8 --> 427.599
dude i can't help him with that but

424.08 --> 431.599
yeah i one of my earliest shows

427.599 --> 433.36
on this channel i had an interview with

431.599 --> 437.44
him

433.36 --> 440.8
like i had him on the show

437.44 --> 444.24
uh was way before early bird and

440.8 --> 447.68
yeah he is he's like

444.24 --> 451.12
yeah well self-professed christian but

447.68 --> 453.919
he's like really

451.12 --> 455.199
yeah he savaged it all out of proportion

453.919 --> 457.75899999999996
as it were

455.199 --> 459.28000000000003
and he's get he's like obsessive devil

457.759 --> 461.36
persecutor and he

459.28 --> 463.11999999999995
basically thinks that everybody is the

461.36 --> 466.24
devil except him

463.12 --> 468.0
it's just i've never seen it so bad

466.24 --> 470.72
with the person that i personally

468.0 --> 474.08
communicated with

470.72 --> 478.0
but yeah not a very pleasant guy

474.08 --> 481.19899999999996
but he did have interesting ideas

478.0 --> 482.08
way back even like he was one of the

481.199 --> 485.199
other

482.08 --> 486.96
alternatives it still published oh so it

485.199 --> 490.56
is really you

486.96 --> 490.56
ha all right

491.039 --> 496.8
i didn't know i unbanned yours this just

494.479 --> 498.4
another channel that you made or

496.8 --> 500.319
something i don't know

498.4 --> 502.479
but yeah you had a pretty interesting

500.319 --> 506.56
conception of the realm

502.479 --> 510.87899999999996
with this like a holographic

506.56 --> 510.879
unraveled globe projection

511.84 --> 517.36
which was kind of like an alternative

515.279 --> 519.88
one of the very few alternatives that

517.36 --> 523.6800000000001
basically deals with

519.88 --> 528.08
non-looping or with looping

523.68 --> 530.2399999999999
flat realm conceptions

528.08 --> 532.9590000000001
yeah it kind of weirded me out i don't

530.24 --> 537.12
think it's correct like that

532.959 --> 540.959
but at least he tried to really

537.12 --> 544.08
find an alternative and not just jump

540.959 --> 547.5999999999999
to easy make make make

544.08 --> 548.1600000000001
on the run conclusions like most others

547.6 --> 551.839
like

548.16 --> 554.7199999999999
it must be disk no it must be glow

551.839 --> 556.32
so that that is something that i thought

554.72 --> 560.9590000000001
was very interesting about him

556.32 --> 564.399
at first then again i got to know him

560.959 --> 567.1199999999999
but yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

564.399 --> 567.92
actively hate on him like any hate that

567.12 --> 570.08
comes to him

567.92 --> 571.36
it's because of what he does like if you

570.08 --> 573.519
checked out his channel

571.36 --> 573.519
just

575.44 --> 579.9200000000001
you know so anybody can make up their

578.32 --> 582.1600000000001
own minds i'm not going to be mean to

579.92 --> 582.16
him

583.519 --> 586.9590000000001
but i will be honest about it

587.92 --> 593.519
and i guess it falls a little bit into

591.36 --> 594.72
the same category as right to hand like

593.519 --> 596.5600000000001
that

594.72 --> 599.279
because right the hand also has just

596.56 --> 601.8389999999999
this massive personality issues

599.279 --> 603.12
blatantly obvious different sorts by the

601.839 --> 605.7600000000001
way

603.12 --> 608.32
he is a very different guy at the same

605.76 --> 611.4399999999999
time he also has very interesting

608.32 --> 614.6400000000001
ideas here and there he just

611.44 --> 618.48
can't handle him that's his problem

614.64 --> 624.72
he just can't he can't focus long enough

618.48 --> 624.72
constantly distracted by paranoia

626.8 --> 634.24
yeah i'm sure you do good siren

632.24 --> 636.5600000000001
right because i don't know with right to

634.24 --> 637.12
hand i'm not directly comparing to him

636.56 --> 640.079
but it's

637.12 --> 641.279
it's there are similarities in the setup

640.079 --> 644.399
as well

641.279 --> 646.8
but right the hands yeah you

644.399 --> 648.0
yeah you got gotta be so unbelievably

646.8 --> 651.5999999999999
tolerant

648.0 --> 656.16
and just know that he's gonna probably

651.6 --> 659.2
get go outburst on something

656.16 --> 660.959
and then totally go into vicious

659.2 --> 663.2
attack mode all of a sudden out of

660.959 --> 663.92
nowhere and then if you can deal with

663.2 --> 666.399
that

663.92 --> 667.04
on a regular basis yeah then you can

666.399 --> 669.68
probably

667.04 --> 675.8389999999999
handle him pretty well i'm not one of

669.68 --> 675.8389999999999
those people

677.519 --> 683.68
yeah the miskang yeah we know that was

680.88 --> 683.68
on video too

683.92 --> 692.8
all right

689.12 --> 694.64
hey my good town on my town goods i mean

692.8 --> 696.88
oh yeah by the way a special shout out

694.64 --> 700.3199999999999
also to dank

696.88 --> 702.959
well offline gave me a small super chat

700.32 --> 704.9590000000001
or a paypal donation

702.959 --> 707.279
like after the show i really appreciate

704.959 --> 709.8389999999999
that thanks

707.279 --> 712.72
thank you man like even little bits at

709.839 --> 716.0790000000001
this point help a lot

712.72 --> 719.2
i have is it 15

716.079 --> 721.5999999999999
cents left on my bank account currently

719.2 --> 723.839
but i got food for today and tomorrow at

721.6 --> 723.839
least

725.04 --> 730.48
and i got one beer for today and i'm

727.519 --> 733.04
gonna have to do with that

730.48 --> 733.04
that's fine

733.68 --> 737.68
and then i'm gonna have to hope that

735.2 --> 741.44
maybe monday something will come in it

737.68 --> 743.4399999999999
should 21 is typically a day for it

741.44 --> 746.399
but sometimes it just doesn't feel like

743.44 --> 749.9200000000001
it and then it's 22 or even up to 24

746.399 --> 749.92
24 so we'll see

750.639 --> 755.2
gonna have to do with what i got

752.72 --> 755.2
currently

755.519 --> 759.76
and then all this all this nonsense will

758.88 --> 763.76
be over

759.76 --> 763.76
quickly after the 24th

767.6 --> 772.48
what right the hand pushed new age last

770.839 --> 775.519
time

772.48 --> 775.519
no what type

776.24 --> 781.12
i know he gets a bit experimental with

778.639 --> 783.279
his conceptions but

781.12 --> 787.839
like i don't think he's literally caught

783.279 --> 787.8389999999999
up in new age type of feely thinking

788.48 --> 801.839
what do you mean martin

827.76 --> 834.24
man dude i used to do it too you know

831.04 --> 835.92
now i'm talking about 20 years ago like

834.24 --> 837.92
in retrospect it just seems so

835.92 --> 841.04
embarrassing

837.92 --> 844.7199999999999
even though i was extremely good at it

841.04 --> 845.8389999999999
like i could get all standardized guru

844.72 --> 850.1600000000001
talkish

845.839 --> 851.7600000000001
i was really good at it but it's just

850.16 --> 857.8389999999999
even though you're good at it doesn't

851.76 --> 857.8389999999999
mean that it's good

858.88 --> 866.32
i you know it's

862.48 --> 869.839
it's like a way of going about

866.32 --> 870.8000000000001
with a certain type of attitude and

869.839 --> 873.1990000000001
feelings open

870.8 --> 874.56
and where your focus is at it's just a

873.199 --> 877.12
way of doing that

874.56 --> 879.1199999999999
and i could do that i'm super intuitive

877.12 --> 881.36
so that works great for me i got this

879.12 --> 885.199
giant palette available

881.36 --> 885.6
to me for that where other people might

885.199 --> 888.88
have

885.6 --> 891.12
little less sensory input

888.88 --> 892.639
and yeah they will have to make shift

891.12 --> 894.639
with what they got

892.639 --> 896.8
usually a few tricks that they got good

894.639 --> 896.8
at

897.04 --> 902.3199999999999
i yeah but it's just not it's better to

900.32 --> 903.12
be honest that's what i figured out i

902.32 --> 906.88
figured out

903.12 --> 910.32
and this is like the esoteric comparison

906.88 --> 914.56
with the god analogy is just

910.32 --> 919.1990000000001
mind baffling to me and logos that

914.56 --> 922.3199999999999
it's just honesty it's it's so

919.199 --> 925.4399999999999
yeah it's the honesty that really

922.32 --> 928.5600000000001
opens up doors

925.44 --> 933.759
that you didn't even know exist

928.56 --> 936.8
and that's multi-level the more honesty

933.759 --> 938.839
and that's like honesty about how you

936.8 --> 941.3599999999999
conduct yourself

938.839 --> 944.32
honesty towards

941.36 --> 947.12
yourself about what you're hiding from

944.32 --> 950.32
yourself and what you're trying to avoid

947.12 --> 951.68
like there's that as well and that's a

950.32 --> 955.279
much tougher one right

951.68 --> 958.8
that's also honesty it's

955.279 --> 962.079
c so the esoteric comparison with

958.8 --> 964.24
logos and just honesty

962.079 --> 965.199
on a spiritual level on a conscious

964.24 --> 967.36
level

965.199 --> 968.8
towards the outside world towards

967.36 --> 973.12
yourself

968.8 --> 976.959
that just doing that just opens up doors

973.12 --> 979.92
reveal things rearrange the energy

976.959 --> 981.04
functions of things in relation to you

979.92 --> 985.759
that you simply

981.04 --> 989.68
cannot imagine until you're there

985.759 --> 993.12
what that's like and this is a pro

989.68 --> 995.92
yeah you remember that at first

993.12 --> 997.839
in the early i already kind of did that

995.92 --> 999.12
but i really had my sort of coming out

997.839 --> 1002.5600000000001
at some point like yeah i'm

999.12 --> 1005.04
really doing this

1002.56 --> 1006.16
and it's it it seems like i'm

1005.04 --> 1009.4399999999999
embarrassing

1006.16 --> 1012.88
myself throwing out all these

1009.44 --> 1014.5600000000001
little details like leaving myself

1012.88 --> 1016.079
vulnerable you know that's what a lot of

1014.56 --> 1018.399
people might think

1016.079 --> 1021.279
i was very focused i was kind of scared

1018.399 --> 1023.44
of doing that at first

1021.279 --> 1024.799
because i felt like yeah i am opening up

1023.44 --> 1026.72
these doors

1024.799 --> 1028.16
and you don't really know what might

1026.72 --> 1030.24
happen

1028.16 --> 1031.3600000000001
you know if you do something wrong then

1030.24 --> 1033.6
something could step

1031.36 --> 1034.8799999999999
in and you open that door and you got a

1033.6 --> 1038.0
problem now

1034.88 --> 1040.16
but as things passed

1038.0 --> 1042.319
and i did make mistakes certain mistakes

1040.16 --> 1046.16
but it never really on purpose

1042.319 --> 1046.1599999999999
thank god i've always avoided that

1046.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
always by accident then

1050.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
eventually like these

1054.32 --> 1060.799
how do you describe that it it just

1057.52 --> 1064.4
turns out that the danger passes

1060.799 --> 1066.32
on certain levels and now i'm no longer

1064.4 --> 1068.16
paranoid i still realize yeah that door

1066.32 --> 1068.799
is still open somebody could still get

1068.16 --> 1072.3200000000002
in

1068.799 --> 1072.8799999999999
but now i am confident because i've had

1072.32 --> 1075.6789999999999
that door

1072.88 --> 1076.88
open i know i can look through the open

1075.679 --> 1081.039
door constantly

1076.88 --> 1084.3200000000002
i can see what's further away

1081.039 --> 1088.48
through that honesty and

1084.32 --> 1088.48
people have a much harder time

1089.679 --> 1092.72
spinning their own fantasies and lies

1092.16 --> 1096.3200000000002
when they

1092.72 --> 1099.6000000000001
face that honesty in a direct connection

1096.32 --> 1104.08
so it also makes other

1099.6 --> 1104.08
people it makes it harder for them

1104.48 --> 1108.88
to lie because the because yeah unless

1107.12 --> 1110.559
they're just unless they've made up

1108.88 --> 1114.0800000000002
their mind but yeah

1110.559 --> 1116.8799999999999
you can also detect signs of this

1114.08 --> 1117.6
because i can feel pain at a distance i

1116.88 --> 1120.64
can do it

1117.6 --> 1121.28
like at close proximity you know and

1120.64 --> 1123.039
this is

1121.28 --> 1124.96
this is a physical so i'm not saying

1123.039 --> 1126.799
that this is even derived from the

1124.96 --> 1128.48
honesty effect i think i was born with

1126.799 --> 1131.9189999999999
this in my genetics

1128.48 --> 1133.84
my dad has some of it as well

1131.919 --> 1135.6000000000001
and just because i have a lot of spirit

1133.84 --> 1138.32
it works really well

1135.6 --> 1139.28
when i do it so i think this is a

1138.32 --> 1142.24
natural skill

1139.28 --> 1143.36
i just happen to have it but with that i

1142.24 --> 1146.48
can literally

1143.36 --> 1149.76
sense pain and what type of pain

1146.48 --> 1151.24
very like because i have felt a lot of

1149.76 --> 1153.36
different pains i can just

1151.24 --> 1156.24
cross-reference

1153.36 --> 1157.84
the type of sensation that i'm literally

1156.24 --> 1160.96
absorbing and then know

1157.84 --> 1164.1599999999999
that's it it feels like oh a muscle

1160.96 --> 1167.44
cramp or it feels like oh it's

1164.16 --> 1167.76
like on the bone you know that i could

1167.44 --> 1170.16
just

1167.76 --> 1172.32
feel it by the type of pain that i

1170.16 --> 1175.2
absorb right

1172.32 --> 1176.72
that's just a physical skill but when i

1175.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
communicate

1176.72 --> 1182.24
it seems like the discipline

1179.84 --> 1184.559
that the routine that i've learned

1182.24 --> 1187.919
taught myself how to do that

1184.559 --> 1188.96
is transplaced in a purely spiritual

1187.919 --> 1192.5590000000002
manner and it can

1188.96 --> 1195.28
sort of sense spiritual

1192.559 --> 1195.76
crunch moments and these things that are

1195.28 --> 1198.08
not

1195.76 --> 1199.919
physical local pain like if they had a

1198.08 --> 1201.039
pain in their arm i couldn't pick it up

1199.919 --> 1204.96
like that

1201.039 --> 1209.28
but i can't pick up spirit pain

1204.96 --> 1212.64
yeah sounds a bit creepy maybe but it is

1209.28 --> 1215.6
it is through consciousness drive

1212.64 --> 1217.76
and just my sensitive spirit you know i

1215.6 --> 1220.8799999999999
used to also be able to

1217.76 --> 1223.84
or may i can probably still do it

1220.88 --> 1224.88
take a look at a picture of somebody

1223.84 --> 1227.6789999999999
that is just

1224.88 --> 1229.8400000000001
and then figure things out about them

1227.679 --> 1232.24
just by picture

1229.84 --> 1233.039
and i would get odd sensations about

1232.24 --> 1237.28
them

1233.039 --> 1241.12
like there's something wrong or

1237.28 --> 1242.1589999999999
like like they're they feel unusually

1241.12 --> 1243.6789999999999
peaceful

1242.159 --> 1245.919
and they turn out like they would be

1243.679 --> 1249.2
dead or something

1245.919 --> 1250.4
yeah anyway that this is this is

1249.2 --> 1254.0800000000002
wandering off into

1250.4 --> 1256.5590000000002
less useful but yeah the

1254.08 --> 1259.28
the the pain century these spiritual

1256.559 --> 1264.1589999999999
moments it really helps

1259.28 --> 1266.559
basically figuring out how people work

1264.159 --> 1267.2800000000002
and then because i'm honest i'll just

1266.559 --> 1270.48
adapt

1267.28 --> 1272.559
to their honest self to who i

1270.48 --> 1274.88
size them up they really are how they

1272.559 --> 1278.48
really respond and then figure it out

1274.88 --> 1280.64
well they might try to still

1278.48 --> 1282.0
portray an image to themselves or the

1280.64 --> 1285.5200000000002
outside world like no no

1282.0 --> 1288.64
it's not like that

1285.52 --> 1291.76
and i'll just ignore it and then that

1288.64 --> 1292.4
will shatter because they feel they got

1291.76 --> 1295.2
caught

1292.4 --> 1296.96
because i see them and not necessarily

1295.2 --> 1299.76
even attacking

1296.96 --> 1301.76
don't have to i don't have to point out

1299.76 --> 1302.96
and like rub it in they're lying about

1301.76 --> 1304.48
something i don't i

1302.96 --> 1307.8400000000001
typically don't do that you might have

1304.48 --> 1312.08
noticed this i only do that

1307.84 --> 1312.08
after it's like getting really painful

1312.159 --> 1317.8400000000001
if they keep just doubling down

1315.44 --> 1319.1200000000001
and then even somebody else says but

1317.84 --> 1321.4399999999998
you're lying about this and then

1319.12 --> 1322.32
no i'm not and then like they're going

1321.44 --> 1325.1200000000001
into like

1322.32 --> 1326.96
crazy territory then i will just call

1325.12 --> 1328.32
them a liar and that's basically intent

1326.96 --> 1330.08
to just shake or wake up

1328.32 --> 1332.3999999999999
like hello do you know what the [ __ ]

1330.08 --> 1335.1999999999998
you're even doing

1332.4 --> 1336.96
then you can be more spiritually violent

1335.2 --> 1339.2
it's like the time for it i've learned

1336.96 --> 1339.2
that

1344.84 --> 1347.84
anyway

1361.2 --> 1368.24
new age deception is well

1364.24 --> 1373.919
knew it well look new age

1368.24 --> 1377.84
like what exactly do you mean with this

1373.919 --> 1377.8400000000001
you mean like the philosophical

1378.64 --> 1384.3200000000002
out there thinking like weird

1381.32 --> 1384.32
philosophizing

1386.559 --> 1390.32
like the for the total free thinking

1388.96 --> 1392.64
that doesn't

1390.32 --> 1394.2
really lead to anything and could

1392.64 --> 1398.159
potentially lead to

1394.2 --> 1402.159
megalomania or extreme depression

1398.159 --> 1405.44
depending on where it goes that

1402.159 --> 1417.3600000000001
it's not really that dangerous because

1405.44 --> 1420.48
it's never really gonna lead anywhere

1417.36 --> 1424.8799999999999
what convinced me the earth is flat

1420.48 --> 1427.039
uh realizing

1424.88 --> 1430.48
for me what really did it on an

1427.039 --> 1433.52
intuitive level i think

1430.48 --> 1435.84
you can't even pinpoint it it's when i

1433.52 --> 1438.8799999999999
realized that

1435.84 --> 1439.36
the idea of outer space and the planets

1438.88 --> 1442.4
and

1439.36 --> 1445.52
especially the sun and the stars

1442.4 --> 1449.039
that that didn't match my

1445.52 --> 1452.96
perception of what the lights are

1449.039 --> 1456.48
that and i think that

1452.96 --> 1459.44
i saw like a high a balloon

1456.48 --> 1460.64
very high balloon footage of the sun one

1459.44 --> 1463.3600000000001
time and then

1460.64 --> 1464.0
this weird lighting spot i don't know

1463.36 --> 1467.36
it's a

1464.0 --> 1469.36
familiar image that like a day

1467.36 --> 1470.8799999999999
yeah it was one of the earlier flat

1469.36 --> 1472.7199999999998
earth videos

1470.88 --> 1474.88
and the weird thing is i saw that thing

1472.72 --> 1476.0
in 2012 when it was even made through

1474.88 --> 1478.88
the dark world

1476.0 --> 1479.36
now i will keep saying this i will

1478.88 --> 1484.0800000000002
[ __ ]

1479.36 --> 1484.08
say this because it's true i saw it

1484.32 --> 1488.559
and i think my ex saw it too because i

1487.279 --> 1491.12
showed it to her

1488.559 --> 1491.76
on the computer it was there for some

1491.12 --> 1496.0
reason

1491.76 --> 1500.08
i don't know why weird [ __ ]

1496.0 --> 1502.32
but i saw that video that footage

1500.08 --> 1503.9189999999999
and eric debay talking over it and i

1502.32 --> 1504.48
don't think he even had a channel back

1503.919 --> 1507.3600000000001
then

1504.48 --> 1508.799
it's so weird but it's just that i

1507.36 --> 1512.6399999999999
experienced that and that's

1508.799 --> 1515.84
just what it is had that memory for a

1512.64 --> 1515.8400000000001
long time

1516.48 --> 1523.6
but when it came back later 2015

1520.0 --> 1527.2
yeah it's the apparent

1523.6 --> 1528.0
sphere some with this sort of spotlight

1527.2 --> 1530.88
over

1528.0 --> 1531.44
over earth with just this it was so high

1530.88 --> 1533.5200000000002
up

1531.44 --> 1534.559
well that thing is super suggestive of

1533.52 --> 1538.08
course oh look it's

1534.559 --> 1540.08
a ball hovering over the earth

1538.08 --> 1541.6789999999999
and there is a spotlight how mysterious

1540.08 --> 1544.72
right

1541.679 --> 1547.76
bypassing that that makes no damn sense

1544.72 --> 1550.08
not because it's like tricked but

1547.76 --> 1551.84
because that doesn't correlate with the

1550.08 --> 1554.0
inverse square law and

1551.84 --> 1556.0
it just it's an already a sign of a

1554.0 --> 1558.159
holographic trait

1556.0 --> 1559.12
because here at ground level the we

1558.159 --> 1562.0800000000002
don't

1559.12 --> 1564.559
see like a spotlight with a with a

1562.08 --> 1567.84
border

1564.559 --> 1570.559
that outside of that border there's just

1567.84 --> 1571.76
less so that's not how it looks on the

1570.559 --> 1573.76
earth level

1571.76 --> 1577.2
right so that was like one of the first

1573.76 --> 1579.76
things that really dislocated

1577.2 --> 1582.32
all the suggestions of what everything

1579.76 --> 1584.1589999999999
is out there

1582.32 --> 1586.32
and just started making me realize like

1584.159 --> 1589.7600000000002
the heavenly bodies

1586.32 --> 1598.6399999999999
are not even physical they're just

1589.76 --> 1601.84
light manifestations and that

1598.64 --> 1604.88
really kind of broke

1601.84 --> 1607.279
on an intuitive level broke the spell of

1604.88 --> 1609.8400000000001
the heliocentric outer universe

1607.279 --> 1611.6
that that could at any point ever be

1609.84 --> 1614.72
real

1611.6 --> 1618.7199999999998
i still yeah grieve or yeah

1614.72 --> 1620.799
i agree for it still for that snap

1618.72 --> 1621.919
it was so painful because it was so

1620.799 --> 1624.72
amazing to

1621.919 --> 1627.279
just believe that there might be all

1624.72 --> 1629.919
these possibilities physically out there

1627.279 --> 1632.159
but yeah since that since that branch

1629.919 --> 1635.2
has snapped off

1632.159 --> 1638.24
others have grown and they're still

1635.2 --> 1640.799
just the hope for just a whole

1638.24 --> 1642.96
pile of incredible extra dimensional

1640.799 --> 1646.799
miracles all from

1642.96 --> 1646.799
god and all those who oppose him

1647.2 --> 1650.24
it's intertwined

1652.08 --> 1655.84
it's weird how that works

1667.36 --> 1670.799
new age people struggles to answer this

1670.24 --> 1673.76
they say

1670.799 --> 1676.799
each person has his own truth in

1673.76 --> 1680.64
objective context that is just nonsense

1676.799 --> 1683.679
well they have

1680.64 --> 1687.8400000000001
renamed the word truth this is

1683.679 --> 1691.6000000000001
a thing right just like science has

1687.84 --> 1694.399
scientists supposedly

1691.6 --> 1695.4399999999998
storytellers have rebrandished the

1694.399 --> 1698.7199999999998
scientific method

1695.44 --> 1701.76
science into

1698.72 --> 1704.799
yeah storytelling time and

1701.76 --> 1707.84
with calculations and backup

1704.799 --> 1709.679
formulations whatever but no science

1707.84 --> 1712.9599999999998
actually

1709.679 --> 1714.24
right they call that science why like

1712.96 --> 1716.08
that

1714.24 --> 1717.52
what i and i've heard it too especially

1716.08 --> 1719.52
in the netherlands in the netherlands

1717.52 --> 1720.96
because like 10 years ago i did go

1719.52 --> 1723.2
around those

1720.96 --> 1724.3990000000001
circles a lot i literally went to small

1723.2 --> 1727.52
meetings

1724.399 --> 1728.2399999999998
and [ __ ] and like uh what do you call it

1727.52 --> 1730.559
like this

1728.24 --> 1732.799
sort of mini festivals where just all

1730.559 --> 1734.96
these people would represent their

1732.799 --> 1737.52
devices and [ __ ] and it was kind of

1734.96 --> 1737.52
fascinating

1737.6 --> 1742.24
met a lot of freaking weirdos there too

1739.84 --> 1742.24
by the way

1742.32 --> 1747.36
right but also extremely intelligent

1745.76 --> 1748.72
people

1747.36 --> 1750.399
people that were so intelligent they

1748.72 --> 1751.84
didn't know what the [ __ ] to do with it

1750.399 --> 1753.52
they were just poured out their minds

1751.84 --> 1756.8799999999999
constantly that time

1753.52 --> 1757.9189999999999
right and uh what was it saying yeah

1756.88 --> 1762.5590000000002
yeah

1757.919 --> 1765.279
they say everybody has their own truth

1762.559 --> 1767.2
like because truth is obj is subjective

1765.279 --> 1767.84
because you can only perceive it through

1767.2 --> 1771.44
and blah blah

1767.84 --> 1774.9599999999998
well they don't realize that's

1771.44 --> 1777.039
the perception like what is the

1774.96 --> 1780.48
consciousness going with

1777.039 --> 1782.8799999999999
as true that is the subjective truth a

1780.48 --> 1783.3600000000001
person has but that is partially routed

1782.88 --> 1787.44
in

1783.36 --> 1791.6
imagination because no individual

1787.44 --> 1793.679
can absolutely have all knowledge

1791.6 --> 1795.76
because not all knowledge is there to be

1793.679 --> 1798.24
had so there will always be

1795.76 --> 1800.0
gaps and that gaps will either be closed

1798.24 --> 1802.96
through quick logic

1800.0 --> 1804.24
or through partly imagination if one

1802.96 --> 1808.3990000000001
dares to go there

1804.24 --> 1811.52
very skeptical people will simply say no

1808.399 --> 1811.52
not going to do that

1811.6 --> 1815.1999999999998
i don't want to try imagine

1815.44 --> 1820.0
and yeah that would but that's basically

1817.36 --> 1821.76
what they mean when they say that

1820.0 --> 1824.159
even though they can't explain it as

1821.76 --> 1827.12
succinctly as i can

1824.159 --> 1828.0
but i know it's that i had i got into

1827.12 --> 1830.32
fights with people

1828.0 --> 1832.559
well into verbal fights with people over

1830.32 --> 1832.559
that

1832.72 --> 1839.039
because i stated no no

1835.84 --> 1842.8799999999999
truth is absolutely objective the do

1839.039 --> 1846.24
the truth doesn't care what you think

1842.88 --> 1849.3600000000001
or feel or imagine what is true

1846.24 --> 1854.559
is true as a universal

1849.36 --> 1858.399
statement basically yeah divine logic

1854.559 --> 1860.399
according yeah to god like it is true

1858.399 --> 1862.799
what some is something is true it is

1860.399 --> 1865.1999999999998
true it doesn't matter if people

1862.799 --> 1869.44
think it's something else it will be

1865.2 --> 1869.44
what it really is and that's the truth

1873.6 --> 1879.84
and yeah people couldn't accept that

1876.799 --> 1879.84
it was very weird

1879.919 --> 1884.0
they were just like no i don't accept

1882.559 --> 1888.1589999999999
that

1884.0 --> 1889.919
like yeah that felt like almost cultish

1888.159 --> 1892.3990000000001
like why would you

1889.919 --> 1895.1200000000001
why would you go against just the

1892.399 --> 1897.279
acceptance that

1895.12 --> 1898.32
you're not all living in your own little

1897.279 --> 1900.399
dimensions

1898.32 --> 1903.039
and you're like many gods or something

1900.399 --> 1905.84
that you can create your own

1903.039 --> 1907.84
rules and no physically real no no no

1905.84 --> 1908.1589999999999
you have your imagination yeah and you

1907.84 --> 1909.9189999999999
can

1908.159 --> 1912.3200000000002
migrate partially into that it works

1909.919 --> 1913.6000000000001
great that's what it's there for it's a

1912.32 --> 1917.279
survival mechanism

1913.6 --> 1919.6789999999999
okay but for

1917.279 --> 1921.039
people that have a lot of faculties

1919.679 --> 1922.96
that's very important

1921.039 --> 1924.8799999999999
because the faculties need busying and

1922.96 --> 1927.279
if you're caught up

1924.88 --> 1928.48
then the imagination is the only course

1927.279 --> 1934.64
left

1928.48 --> 1938.08
to basically not have your brain crash

1934.64 --> 1940.3990000000001
because you can't utilize your faculties

1938.08 --> 1940.399
anyway

1943.039 --> 1949.44
they couldn't accept it

1946.24 --> 1952.72
they couldn't accept

1949.44 --> 1956.64
that there is outside of the individual

1952.72 --> 1959.039
a universal truth situation

1956.64 --> 1960.48
things that are real that we all share

1959.039 --> 1963.679
because that's also

1960.48 --> 1968.0
the foundation of physics for example

1963.679 --> 1973.1200000000001
so what they were saying was basically

1968.0 --> 1973.12
contradicting physics

1973.2 --> 1978.88
and then yeah i think i even said that

1976.48 --> 1979.679
but they just ignored it and that means

1978.88 --> 1983.919
that they would

1979.679 --> 1986.0
literally go into fantastical territory

1983.919 --> 1988.0800000000002
and they wouldn't even consciously

1986.0 --> 1990.64
realize it because in other

1988.08 --> 1992.32
regions they were extremely serious and

1990.64 --> 1995.519
detailed and meticulous

1992.32 --> 1997.76
and like they wouldn't make mistakes

1995.519 --> 1998.799
about some idea they had they were very

1997.76 --> 2001.919
precise but

1998.799 --> 2004.96
when they were just going about

2001.919 --> 2008.64
just free thinking they had

2004.96 --> 2011.3600000000001
they were just wild and seemingly

2008.64 --> 2011.3600000000001
delusional

2012.64 --> 2016.3990000000001
like in their frequency and now i had

2015.12 --> 2018.9599999999998
still some

2016.399 --> 2022.9599999999998
weird ideas back then because when i did

2018.96 --> 2022.96
in that period i was not a flat earther

2024.399 --> 2030.84
but i i did i was a nasa skeptic i

2029.2 --> 2032.159
didn't believe in the moon landing back

2030.84 --> 2034.6399999999999
then

2032.159 --> 2034.64
for a while

2035.279 --> 2040.32
because just yet from what i've seen it

2037.36 --> 2040.32
just no

2040.799 --> 2045.679
so i wasn't even perfect in my

2042.72 --> 2048.8
assertions but i would always try to

2045.679 --> 2052.7200000000003
perfect you know just

2048.8 --> 2055.8390000000004
not be wild and leave it all open like

2052.72 --> 2058.6389999999997
give room for secret retreat and

2055.839 --> 2060.0
secret conspiracy basically because

2058.639 --> 2061.76
reality is so fluid

2060.0 --> 2063.04
you can just live in your own crazy

2061.76 --> 2065.44
dimension and

2063.04 --> 2067.2
fantasize about really disgusting things

2065.44 --> 2068.159
or something like that's all perfectly

2067.2 --> 2074.6389999999997
fine

2068.159 --> 2077.76
because it's not yeah

2074.639 --> 2081.44
that's like the consequence of that

2077.76 --> 2084.639
that way of doing things and i was

2081.44 --> 2086.96
i opposed that like and it's not like

2084.639 --> 2088.159
this is all outspoken by them these are

2086.96 --> 2091.76
all

2088.159 --> 2095.28
logical consequences that they

2091.76 --> 2097.28
did not realize or if they would be

2095.28 --> 2098.88
confronted with it they would just have

2097.28 --> 2102.0
their ego say no this

2098.88 --> 2105.76
is our we are free you're not gonna tell

2102.0 --> 2106.56
us anything morally anything you're not

2105.76 --> 2108.7200000000003
gonna

2106.56 --> 2110.7999999999997
we are free a hundred you're nothing you

2108.72 --> 2114.3999999999996
you cannot say anything

2110.8 --> 2116.1600000000003
that'll make us change how we do things

2114.4 --> 2117.839
we will never give up any of this

2116.16 --> 2121.7599999999998
freedom that was

2117.839 --> 2124.64
a lot of their attitude very defiant but

2121.76 --> 2127.8390000000004
also yeah with that just defined against

2124.64 --> 2131.359
just logic why would you be defiant

2127.839 --> 2134.0789999999997
against logic

2131.359 --> 2134.0789999999997
well yeah

2134.88 --> 2138.0
these days of course that's a little bit

2136.88 --> 2142.1600000000003
more common

2138.0 --> 2144.32
commonplace reality it seems

2142.16 --> 2146.3999999999996
it seems unfortunately that is not as

2144.32 --> 2150.079
rare as it should be

2146.4 --> 2152.2400000000002
these days the way people

2150.079 --> 2154.32
formulate arguments especially on the

2152.24 --> 2159.68
baller side and

2154.32 --> 2173.839
what's going down

2159.68 --> 2173.839
in the media it's absolutely insane

2184.839 --> 2187.839
uh

2204.24 --> 2210.0
oh goody yeah

2207.68 --> 2212.0
well that's fine you know you can all

2210.0 --> 2213.44
get caught up on the distractions of the

2212.0 --> 2216.64
666

2213.44 --> 2218.8
in the number and just i don't know be

2216.64 --> 2219.68
distracted by it stare at it all the

2218.8 --> 2222.0
time

2219.68 --> 2226.0
in the meantime i'm gonna lay down some

2222.0 --> 2226.0
really heavy esoteric [ __ ]

2226.4 --> 2233.599
and talk about my well magic skills

2230.16 --> 2235.52
if you will that are natural you don't

2233.599 --> 2237.119
have to do anything special for it you

2235.52 --> 2240.4
just have to stop

2237.119 --> 2244.079
screwing with yourself stop squirting

2240.4 --> 2244.88
stop wasting your energy figure things

2244.079 --> 2249.04
out

2244.88 --> 2249.52
and then make them part of your skill

2249.04 --> 2252.8
set

2249.52 --> 2254.24
intuition and then migrate get better at

2252.8 --> 2257.079
it

2254.24 --> 2258.4799999999996
take it very seriously take the

2257.079 --> 2260.8
responsibility take

2258.48 --> 2262.8
the pain and the consequences and

2260.8 --> 2264.88
everything that comes with it

2262.8 --> 2267.28
like really sit there you know and this

2264.88 --> 2268.839
is this is the primary problem with most

2267.28 --> 2272.1600000000003
people now

2268.839 --> 2273.119
everywhere is they can't stop squirting

2272.16 --> 2276.16
everything

2273.119 --> 2276.1600000000003
is too easy

2277.04 --> 2283.119
there it's no challenge to survive

2280.079 --> 2284.7200000000003
so now you have to instead survive your

2283.119 --> 2288.1600000000003
own ego and that ego

2284.72 --> 2291.2799999999997
just really makes it into this

2288.16 --> 2294.3199999999997
mega game for itself

2291.28 --> 2297.6800000000003
to help prevent you

2294.32 --> 2301.119
from being forced

2297.68 --> 2303.7599999999998
to realize to become

2301.119 --> 2305.44
conscious to sit in a very painful

2303.76 --> 2308.1600000000003
realization

2305.44 --> 2310.16
and then let it sink in yeah this is one

2308.16 --> 2310.72
of the things that the ego and this is

2310.16 --> 2314.16
really

2310.72 --> 2316.72
the base function i think sometimes

2314.16 --> 2318.24
preventing you from sitting in that pain

2316.72 --> 2321.52
and just letting it

2318.24 --> 2324.72
sit sink through and then

2321.52 --> 2327.359
not depress yourself to make it use

2324.72 --> 2328.3199999999997
yourself forget that again no no you

2327.359 --> 2332.0789999999997
have to let it

2328.32 --> 2336.079
sit there and then let it sink in

2332.079 --> 2339.8390000000004
become it become one with it and trust

2336.079 --> 2341.04
that you will spiritually evolve

2339.839 --> 2343.44
spiritually only

2341.04 --> 2345.04
because physically may well phys you

2343.44 --> 2347.52
will physically adapt

2345.04 --> 2348.48
spiritually you can evolve if you just

2347.52 --> 2351.839
sit

2348.48 --> 2354.4
in the pain of the realization and then

2351.839 --> 2356.0789999999997
don't forget about it but realize

2354.4 --> 2360.48
eventually

2356.079 --> 2363.44
you it can be overcome it's temporary

2360.48 --> 2363.92
that unimaginable pain that the ego

2363.44 --> 2368.32
becomes

2363.92 --> 2370.64
obsessed at avoiding is only temporary

2368.32 --> 2371.92
once you overcome it and that's why the

2370.64 --> 2374.96
ego is

2371.92 --> 2376.48
literally the biggest challenge in the

2374.96 --> 2380.0
universe

2376.48 --> 2382.4
of all mankind especially now especially

2380.0 --> 2385.599
now that survival

2382.4 --> 2388.079
is basically guaranteed it seems

2385.599 --> 2391.599
sometimes it's not

2388.079 --> 2393.599
you know they like to imagine or

2391.599 --> 2395.3590000000004
yeah give everybody imagination it's

2393.599 --> 2398.88
very hard but it's technically

2395.359 --> 2400.24
not hard not really in the universal

2398.88 --> 2402.0
truth anymore

2400.24 --> 2403.5989999999997
well not over here in the western world

2402.0 --> 2405.119
anyway

2403.599 --> 2406.8
you know there's still third world

2405.119 --> 2409.44
countries where people are just left to

2406.8 --> 2412.7200000000003
their devices and then

2409.44 --> 2413.2000000000003
some shitty situations on top yeah they

2412.72 --> 2416.64
got

2413.2 --> 2420.56
trouble that's that's real

2416.64 --> 2422.8799999999997
survival dra that when you get that

2420.56 --> 2424.48
it programs you in another way you

2422.88 --> 2426.48
become another type of person your

2424.48 --> 2428.56
spirit becomes very different

2426.48 --> 2429.76
those people are very different they're

2428.56 --> 2433.359
often much more

2429.76 --> 2433.92
serious and they do see westerners often

2433.359 --> 2435.839
it's like

2433.92 --> 2437.28
like these people are completely out of

2435.839 --> 2441.119
their minds man

2437.28 --> 2443.92
like they know because they had to

2441.119 --> 2444.88
actually survive and when you have to

2443.92 --> 2447.92
survive

2444.88 --> 2451.04
then the ego becomes

2447.92 --> 2453.6800000000003
more a tool

2451.04 --> 2454.8
it adapts like because that's what it's

2453.68 --> 2457.1189999999997
there for

2454.8 --> 2459.28
and if it doesn't it becomes bored and

2457.119 --> 2461.92
then starts to reroute its

2459.28 --> 2464.6400000000003
focus on prevent another type of

2461.92 --> 2467.76
survival emotional survival

2464.64 --> 2468.319
prevent you from sit realizing that

2467.76 --> 2472.3190000000004
point

2468.319 --> 2475.599
of overcoming it sitting through it

2472.319 --> 2477.68
and then becoming better and moving on

2475.599 --> 2480.1600000000003
it starts to try and prevent that

2477.68 --> 2484.3999999999996
because it doesn't have to focus on

2480.16 --> 2484.3999999999996
making you physically survive anymore

2485.839 --> 2493.44
right now that's

2489.44 --> 2496.56
that's the real 666 problem we got

2493.44 --> 2499.92
because just look look out there

2496.56 --> 2504.64
who are the freaking satanists

2499.92 --> 2507.599
often are they poor people

2504.64 --> 2510.4
are there a lot of satanists in third

2507.599 --> 2514.6400000000003
world countries

2510.4 --> 2518.4
no no it's actually the people

2514.64 --> 2522.0789999999997
that can survive pretty easily

2518.4 --> 2524.2400000000002
physically often kind of wealthy

2522.079 --> 2525.44
and they might be ignored or they just

2524.24 --> 2528.24
confronted with

2525.44 --> 2531.52
the craziness of their parents that are

2528.24 --> 2531.52
indecent or whatever

2531.76 --> 2537.119
yeah they start to get all six six six

2534.56 --> 2540.0
now don't they

2537.119 --> 2540.88
sometimes yeah i kind of did it in my

2540.0 --> 2543.76
own way with

2540.88 --> 2543.76
the gothic

2545.68 --> 2551.839
because i could survive very easily i

2549.04 --> 2551.839
was not poor

2552.64 --> 2559.2
so that's what that it's because

2555.76 --> 2562.4
of the lack of survival

2559.2 --> 2563.7599999999998
situations it's easy to survive

2562.4 --> 2566.319
physically so the ego

2563.76 --> 2566.3190000000004
starts to

2566.8 --> 2574.079
focus on on ego oh yeah and

2570.88 --> 2578.1600000000003
i'm the i'm losing my focus

2574.079 --> 2584.0
so hold on

2578.16 --> 2584.0
it starts to focus on emotional survival

2584.8 --> 2591.04
it just does that and you pay it no mind

2588.72 --> 2592.0
you don't really need to but it just

2591.04 --> 2594.64
does its thing

2592.0 --> 2595.92
as its emotional survival mechanism but

2594.64 --> 2599.2
over time

2595.92 --> 2601.119
that starts to become either dead or a

2599.2 --> 2603.4399999999996
festering wound

2601.119 --> 2604.7200000000003
because you got to confront yourself

2603.44 --> 2607.599
with problems to

2604.72 --> 2609.839
move ahead this is part of adulthood

2607.599 --> 2613.599
even

2609.839 --> 2616.72
but yeah technically

2613.599 --> 2617.28
if you know no shame or if nobody cares

2616.72 --> 2619.359
or if

2617.28 --> 2621.8390000000004
everybody only cares about money in your

2619.359 --> 2625.2
family or everybody around you

2621.839 --> 2627.599
then yeah

2625.2 --> 2629.359
you can still give your ego what it

2627.599 --> 2630.0
wants you can just be shameless and

2629.359 --> 2633.44
survive

2630.0 --> 2637.76
still you can be a big man baby or a

2633.44 --> 2641.68
disgusting [ __ ] or something rancid [ __ ]

2637.76 --> 2645.599
and you can still survive

2641.68 --> 2649.2799999999997
see it's all because of luxury problems

2645.599 --> 2652.319
really it's yeah that's that's the real

2649.28 --> 2654.48
that's the punishment for for your

2652.319 --> 2658.8
wealth

2654.48 --> 2662.96
that's a in the world effect

2658.8 --> 2665.44
remember wealthy man going to heaven's

2662.96 --> 2670.319
chances are very slim

2665.44 --> 2677.839
well this is why it's on earth

2670.319 --> 2677.839
it's right there

2678.16 --> 2681.92
everybody already knows this they just

2680.24 --> 2685.2799999999997
haven't put these two

2681.92 --> 2688.56
elements together it seems

2685.28 --> 2690.6400000000003
seems like they've been discontorted on

2688.56 --> 2693.44
purpose maybe

2690.64 --> 2694.0
because people don't like to stair

2693.44 --> 2696.7200000000003
really

2694.0 --> 2698.96
up close to reality as much because that

2696.72 --> 2702.0
is also scary

2698.96 --> 2705.359
and the ego then steps in to try to

2702.0 --> 2707.92
prevent that emotional distraught

2705.359 --> 2719.839
makes you forget about it or move away

2707.92 --> 2719.839
or move against it

2720.079 --> 2723.6800000000003
right but at the same time yeah people

2722.8 --> 2726.7200000000003
are not going to

2723.68 --> 2729.9199999999996
abandon luxuries

2726.72 --> 2729.9199999999996
if they are available

2730.079 --> 2735.04
now if they're not available that

2732.4 --> 2737.76
doesn't mean that things will go back to

2735.04 --> 2738.64
the way they used to be because these

2737.76 --> 2741.599
luxuries

2738.64 --> 2742.4
are there they can exist people know how

2741.599 --> 2745.6800000000003
to make them

2742.4 --> 2749.119
it's not gonna go away

2745.68 --> 2752.3999999999996
right the ego won't let it it'll give

2749.119 --> 2752.4
people nightmares

2753.04 --> 2756.88
that's why people get addicted to that

2758.839 --> 2763.2799999999997
[ __ ]

2760.0 --> 2763.28
a very weird system

2768.24 --> 2772.0
all right but here's a trick and this is

2771.68 --> 2776.16
my

2772.0 --> 2779.44
trick this is why i'm a paladin

2776.16 --> 2782.24
right truth over all things for real

2779.44 --> 2784.4
and working on it keep digging even into

2782.24 --> 2787.4399999999996
myself with truth

2784.4 --> 2793.2000000000003
because i prioritize truth

2787.44 --> 2793.2000000000003
even over pain and even over

2793.599 --> 2802.079
like chances to get more wealth i guess

2797.119 --> 2805.44
right that basically

2802.079 --> 2807.76
reroutes the ego game because it now has

2805.44 --> 2811.04
a designation it has

2807.76 --> 2814.079
this principle the method

2811.04 --> 2817.839
i utilize my ego to to

2814.079 --> 2820.96
enforce that because

2817.839 --> 2823.119
and this gets really weird now this

2820.96 --> 2825.119
this is really weird this might not be

2823.119 --> 2827.92
with everyone like that but

2825.119 --> 2830.079
because also being truthful is kind of

2827.92 --> 2833.359
like a punishment

2830.079 --> 2837.04
and the ego can go with that

2833.359 --> 2840.5589999999997
there's like the sort of weird inner

2837.04 --> 2843.68
twist payoff in inner ego

2840.559 --> 2845.8390000000004
thing going on it's very freer it's

2843.68 --> 2845.839
weird

2845.92 --> 2853.119
right because being super truthful yeah

2849.44 --> 2856.839
it you're cut off and you're isolated

2853.119 --> 2861.04
because nobody else is doing it like

2856.839 --> 2861.04
that right there's people

2862.0 --> 2865.839
getting close enough that people do get

2864.96 --> 2869.44
to me

2865.839 --> 2873.2799999999997
but at first it's like

2869.44 --> 2877.2000000000003
a super isolation at it

2873.28 --> 2880.4
but instead of fearing it

2877.2 --> 2883.68
i kind of became i used a very

2880.4 --> 2887.599
old issue that i had self-hatred

2883.68 --> 2889.2799999999997
and just tricked my ego into

2887.599 --> 2891.3590000000004
seeing being truthful as a

2889.28 --> 2895.2000000000003
self-punishment

2891.359 --> 2897.92
yeah through that

2895.2 --> 2900.0789999999997
i did that pretty early on it was very

2897.92 --> 2900.559
subconscious it kind of made me look

2900.079 --> 2903.6800000000003
like

2900.559 --> 2905.44
crazy because it's like i suddenly blurt

2903.68 --> 2906.5589999999997
out a confession that's kind of how it

2905.44 --> 2909.599
started out the first

2906.559 --> 2910.7200000000003
was extremely relieving and it prevented

2909.599 --> 2914.48
me from becoming

2910.72 --> 2915.52
like a mega ira because i could have

2914.48 --> 2919.68
turned into a

2915.52 --> 2922.88
mega ira you know the ira from

2919.68 --> 2927.359
mountain bear cartoon like very bad

2922.88 --> 2930.559
because of the inner secrecy potential

2927.359 --> 2932.0
but ramming it open through like a

2930.559 --> 2934.6400000000003
punishment

2932.0 --> 2935.76
i had to do it myself through my ego

2934.64 --> 2938.64
punish myself

2935.76 --> 2940.4
to just force truth out there and even

2938.64 --> 2942.7999999999997
break situations

2940.4 --> 2945.04
ruining things yeah and sometimes it's

2942.8 --> 2947.6800000000003
been extremely punishing and

2945.04 --> 2948.5589999999997
i i get hateful towards myself

2947.68 --> 2950.8799999999997
afterwards like

2948.559 --> 2952.48
why did you do that it was actually

2950.88 --> 2956.0
right there

2952.48 --> 2959.92
but no there were a couple of things off

2956.0 --> 2960.72
that i felt and i had to force that out

2959.92 --> 2963.2000000000003
in the open

2960.72 --> 2964.72
by becoming forcefully truthful in

2963.2 --> 2966.319
something

2964.72 --> 2967.9199999999996
and that would work because it would

2966.319 --> 2970.079
force it out

2967.92 --> 2971.839
but then afterward i couldn't accept

2970.079 --> 2974.6400000000003
like but i didn't get

2971.839 --> 2976.319
what i wanted didn't get the girl i

2974.64 --> 2979.5989999999997
didn't get the job

2976.319 --> 2982.4
that sort of [ __ ] right

2979.599 --> 2983.04
but because i constantly did that now i

2982.4 --> 2986.1600000000003
have this

2983.04 --> 2988.88
mechanism and i have this unique

2986.16 --> 2992.72
approach where the door is always open

2988.88 --> 2996.4
and because that door is always open

2992.72 --> 2999.5989999999997
no secret [ __ ] has gathered as much

2996.4 --> 3003.04
because the door is open i know it

2999.599 --> 3004.6400000000003
it's like yes people know everything

3003.04 --> 3006.72
about me

3004.64 --> 3007.839
not just the things that i say that is

3006.72 --> 3009.839
how i see it

3007.839 --> 3012.88
i don't know if it's literally true but

3009.839 --> 3015.7599999999998
that is my vantage point

3012.88 --> 3016.48
like very consciously like i'm being

3015.76 --> 3018.48
watched at

3016.48 --> 3021.04
all time like my entire thing is

3018.48 --> 3024.079
recorded like a movie it seems

3021.04 --> 3025.599
and why do i think that well partially

3024.079 --> 3028.559
because of my dark world

3025.599 --> 3030.2400000000002
my yeah my dark world experience that

3028.559 --> 3032.3190000000004
convinced me that that's kind of the

3030.24 --> 3035.359
case

3032.319 --> 3035.359
it's very odd

3035.76 --> 3041.0400000000004
right so yeah it's all getting a bit

3037.839 --> 3042.96
complicated now

3041.04 --> 3045.04
but yeah the truthfulness and the door

3042.96 --> 3047.76
that it has forcefully opened

3045.04 --> 3050.079
has prevented me from degrading into an

3047.76 --> 3053.0400000000004
ira

3050.079 --> 3055.44
and i can still be a little bit trixie i

3053.04 --> 3058.72
still have those traits but i've just

3055.44 --> 3060.319
i'm i return into a paladin

3058.72 --> 3062.3999999999996
and when you do that for real you do

3060.319 --> 3064.0
that for real but yeah the ira and

3062.4 --> 3066.839
mountain bear he's not going to do that

3064.0 --> 3069.839
obviously he can't he's already too far

3066.839 --> 3069.839
gone

3070.48 --> 3077.2
right but at the same time

3073.76 --> 3080.4
it's a unique combination because i

3077.2 --> 3083.04
got this truth power it is a power it is

3080.4 --> 3084.0
literally a power that nobody dares use

3083.04 --> 3087.359
because they still

3084.0 --> 3089.52
are caught up with their ego preventing

3087.359 --> 3091.7599999999998
the emotional pain

3089.52 --> 3093.28
the emotional survival mechanism most

3091.76 --> 3096.559
people do

3093.28 --> 3099.119
like 99.99 percent

3096.559 --> 3099.119
of people

3107.119 --> 3110.88
and like very wise holy men or however

3110.16 --> 3113.52
you consider that

3110.88 --> 3114.7200000000003
they know it too like yeah they would

3113.52 --> 3117.599
say yeah of course

3114.72 --> 3118.16
i still have an ego and the stronger you

3117.599 --> 3120.079
get

3118.16 --> 3122.319
this is something i've also said

3120.079 --> 3125.2000000000003
stronger you get the more conscious

3122.319 --> 3127.68
more dedicated the most powerful your

3125.2 --> 3129.68
ego will fight back to balance it out

3127.68 --> 3130.8799999999997
it will also become stronger it will

3129.68 --> 3133.5989999999997
also have

3130.88 --> 3134.48
your faculties available to it if you

3133.599 --> 3139.839
allow it

3134.48 --> 3139.839
see all these things

3141.52 --> 3146.559
all right what is this

3148.559 --> 3151.6800000000003
sorry i've been kind of annoying you i

3150.4 --> 3167.839
don't know if you followed

3151.68 --> 3167.839
anything about what i'm saying

3169.37 --> 3176.64
[Music]

3172.079 --> 3181.8390000000004
oh man that sun is just so

3176.64 --> 3181.839
thick it's really nice the sun

3182.4 --> 3188.559
i can't really explain it

3185.599 --> 3190.079
did you also notice that yeah i'm

3188.559 --> 3193.44
breaking off my sentences

3190.079 --> 3193.44
i can't really explain

3193.76 --> 3201.44
why it just seems like it's a

3198.0 --> 3204.319
august sun like an early

3201.44 --> 3206.2400000000002
august sun like of wit but at the same

3204.319 --> 3208.319
time it is so cold

3206.24 --> 3209.839
why is the wind so cold how does that

3208.319 --> 3213.359
work what is called

3209.839 --> 3215.2799999999997
cooling it off you know

3213.359 --> 3217.2
the seasonal mechanisms are still

3215.28 --> 3221.28
mysterious like

3217.2 --> 3221.2799999999997
what actually causes all

3221.599 --> 3226.88
the specific heat because yeah

3230.16 --> 3233.839
how can this be how can at one point the

3233.119 --> 3236.1600000000003
sun

3233.839 --> 3236.88
be super hot and then the air gets all

3236.16 --> 3238.7999999999997
warm

3236.88 --> 3241.2000000000003
and then another point the sun is super

3238.8 --> 3242.079
hot and then the air doesn't get all

3241.2 --> 3244.0
warm

3242.079 --> 3247.119
how the hell does that work i don't get

3244.0 --> 3247.119
it it's

3247.359 --> 3251.839
weather is freaking complicated

3255.599 --> 3258.1600000000003
hey neil

3262.839 --> 3265.839
right

3267.2 --> 3272.64
but yeah another weird thing was is that

3269.839 --> 3277.119
the sun position seemed different

3272.64 --> 3280.5589999999997
because remember usually at two o'clock

3277.119 --> 3281.359
the sun like doesn't hit the wall

3280.559 --> 3284.7200000000003
anymore

3281.359 --> 3285.2
well if i'm not mistaken and i don't

3284.72 --> 3288.3999999999996
think i

3285.2 --> 3290.5589999999997
am when i started the show

3288.4 --> 3293.119
you could see that the sun was still

3290.559 --> 3297.119
even hitting the chair

3293.119 --> 3297.119
and that was at five past two

3297.359 --> 3303.359
so the angle has changed what

3300.96 --> 3303.359
how can

3304.48 --> 3307.839
why how

3308.24 --> 3313.52
how can it still be hitting it

3313.68 --> 3321.359
later during

3316.96 --> 3323.839
autumn i don't understand

3321.359 --> 3325.839
it should be the other way around right

3323.839 --> 3326.72
there's going to be less sun after the

3325.839 --> 3329.119
summer

3326.72 --> 3331.52
so how could it then still be hitting my

3329.119 --> 3335.839
chair after two i

3331.52 --> 3335.839
i what

3346.839 --> 3351.7599999999998
right

3348.4 --> 3354.96
i smoked the strong stuff well i

3351.76 --> 3358.0
i have smoked the joint but that's like

3354.96 --> 3358.0
over an hour ago

3359.52 --> 3363.92
now it's more because i'm just digging

3361.76 --> 3366.559
into pretty etheric subjects

3363.92 --> 3367.44
and i'm having a little trouble with it

3366.559 --> 3371.119
also because

3367.44 --> 3371.119
yeah i know

3371.359 --> 3377.839
i got problems with my jaw again so

3375.04 --> 3380.88
but i'm not drinking any coffee at least

3377.839 --> 3380.88
so that'll go away

3382.079 --> 3391.8390000000004
that's also it is also distracting

3398.4 --> 3401.28
what's the issue

3402.72 --> 3407.04
i can talk about these things when i'm

3404.48 --> 3409.359
not smoking as well

3407.04 --> 3409.359
you know

3410.559 --> 3414.0
it's not like i start to talk about

3412.559 --> 3417.6800000000003
etheric things

3414.0 --> 3420.88
only when i smoked no but it does

3417.68 --> 3424.5589999999997
and this is the funny thing

3420.88 --> 3428.319
it does usually amplify my sensories

3424.559 --> 3431.76
so i can work like i can magnetize

3428.319 --> 3433.68
better when i smoke it's a fact

3431.76 --> 3435.0400000000004
also have to be more careful because i

3433.68 --> 3438.0789999999997
can also over

3435.04 --> 3440.48
yeah gather too much tension

3438.079 --> 3441.92
and then even physically get myself hurt

3440.48 --> 3444.48
because of that it happened

3441.92 --> 3448.64
that it strained the muscle just for

3444.48 --> 3448.64
magnetizing it's pretty freaky

3450.72 --> 3456.64
but yeah all these things i can talk

3454.24 --> 3459.1189999999997
about everything that i'm talking about

3456.64 --> 3460.0789999999997
without smoking it doesn't literally do

3459.119 --> 3462.96
anything

3460.079 --> 3462.96
like that it just

3464.16 --> 3470.16
it's i don't know it just smoothens

3467.2 --> 3471.7599999999998
things out a little like in my heart

3470.16 --> 3475.839
mostly

3471.76 --> 3475.8390000000004
like over here

3480.799 --> 3488.319
you can magnetize yeah i got

3484.0 --> 3491.839
i got that skill since i was 15.

3488.319 --> 3495.04
but i really officially figured it out

3491.839 --> 3498.5589999999997
when i was 18 when my first girlfriend

3495.04 --> 3503.839
taught me i was completely

3498.559 --> 3503.8390000000004
mind baffled by that like what

3514.839 --> 3517.839
well

3525.44 --> 3545.839
what i got some trolls here it seems

3529.359 --> 3545.839
they don't like it

3565.599 --> 3573.3590000000004
what neil i i don't understand what

3569.119 --> 3576.799
you're saying

3573.359 --> 3580.0789999999997
they can't pinpoint or explain

3576.799 --> 3582.4
the constitution of marriage

3580.079 --> 3587.2000000000003
or its origin nobody knows where it's

3582.4 --> 3589.92
coming from

3587.2 --> 3591.4399999999996
well it's just an institution basically

3589.92 --> 3595.839
remember

3591.44 --> 3595.839
so it's like uh

3596.64 --> 3603.839
i think originally kings did it

3600.799 --> 3607.04
didn't they isn't there

3603.839 --> 3610.0789999999997
like marriage references in very old

3607.04 --> 3610.079
scriptures and all that

3610.319 --> 3618.079
yeah like okay

3614.88 --> 3621.599
we want to have family and babies okay

3618.079 --> 3624.799
you go to the chief or the king

3621.599 --> 3627.52
that's probably the chief back then

3624.799 --> 3629.359
and they would just make it so it's like

3627.52 --> 3631.359
an official declaration

3629.359 --> 3633.04
that that's it it's an institution it's

3631.359 --> 3636.5589999999997
an official declaration

3633.04 --> 3636.5589999999997
it's a system a contract

3636.799 --> 3643.839
between man woman and god

3644.559 --> 3649.0400000000004
and yeah how old can that be well how

3646.72 --> 3653.4399999999996
old are contracts

3649.04 --> 3657.7599999999998
you know what can you please

3653.44 --> 3659.2000000000003
what uh just ban him

3657.76 --> 3661.5200000000004
if you see him again i don't know why he

3659.2 --> 3671.839
keep timing out

3661.52 --> 3671.839
he's already been

3682.839 --> 3685.839
okay

3707.04 --> 3710.16
there were just stories

3710.4 --> 3714.799
right well you don't have to believe in

3712.48 --> 3718.0
them for them to be real though

3714.799 --> 3720.72
you know that's one of the few weird

3718.0 --> 3723.599
little things about it

3720.72 --> 3724.5589999999997
like creation and the design does not

3723.599 --> 3728.079
care

3724.559 --> 3730.1600000000003
for your ignorance your ignorance will

3728.079 --> 3733.2000000000003
be punished one way or the other whether

3730.16 --> 3737.2
you believe it will or not

3733.2 --> 3740.96
time will tell and it is already telling

3737.2 --> 3744.96
because of your habits your conceptions

3740.96 --> 3747.039
the ways you go about you're gonna

3744.96 --> 3748.2400000000002
just gradually turn more pharisee

3747.039 --> 3752.079
because eventually

3748.24 --> 3753.5989999999997
all the logos sides just won't make any

3752.079 --> 3755.039
more sense to you because you've

3753.599 --> 3769.839
detached

3755.039 --> 3769.8390000000004
yourself from it it's as simple as that

3775.039 --> 3779.599
you know usually when i see people

3777.039 --> 3781.6800000000003
saying that

3779.599 --> 3783.28
what i realize about it is that they

3781.68 --> 3784.0
literally don't know what the [ __ ]

3783.28 --> 3787.039
they're saying

3784.0 --> 3789.839
they literally don't you can't

3787.039 --> 3792.0
say that and actually know what the [ __ ]

3789.839 --> 3794.72
you're talking about

3792.0 --> 3795.68
you're probably latched on to a very

3794.72 --> 3799.2799999999997
specific

3795.68 --> 3800.3999999999996
philosophy forwarded conception of some

3799.28 --> 3803.92
kind

3800.4 --> 3807.119
and then say no it's not right

3803.92 --> 3809.119
that's what most people do that think

3807.119 --> 3812.1600000000003
they don't believe in any of that they

3809.119 --> 3815.599
just haven't really thought about it

3812.16 --> 3815.5989999999997
that's usually what that is

3821.44 --> 3829.2000000000003
thought about how absolutely inevitable

3824.88 --> 3829.2000000000003
and just it yeah you can't

3830.72 --> 3835.2799999999997
like reality physical reality is

3833.52 --> 3839.44
impossible

3835.28 --> 3842.48
without a creator but yeah that's just

3839.44 --> 3843.68
too much just don't want it you don't

3842.48 --> 3845.359
want to think about it that's

3843.68 --> 3847.7599999999998
the the whole thing we come back to the

3845.359 --> 3849.839
beginning remember

3847.76 --> 3850.96
the problem is not that you cannot

3849.839 --> 3854.4
attain

3850.96 --> 3856.319
the insight the problem is you can't

3854.4 --> 3860.4
handle the consequences

3856.319 --> 3861.359
and your ego ensures your emotional

3860.4 --> 3865.039
survival

3861.359 --> 3867.92
so you step away and you impose

3865.039 --> 3868.48
an opposite view to protect yourself

3867.92 --> 3871.599
against

3868.48 --> 3873.68
the absolute insight that will ascend

3871.599 --> 3881.839
your very consciousness

3873.68 --> 3881.839
that's what it is

3892.839 --> 3895.839
so

3898.079 --> 3904.7200000000003
it's it's amazing sometimes that

3901.599 --> 3908.0
i just say certain things and then

3904.72 --> 3909.9199999999996
like immediately it reflects upon the

3908.0 --> 3913.2
chat

3909.92 --> 3913.2000000000003
immediately they do it

3914.319 --> 3923.839
like it's an honor to prove me right

3918.16 --> 3923.839
for them or something very bizarre

3932.16 --> 3935.359
oh oh you didn't have to time him out

3934.64 --> 3939.2799999999997
for that

3935.359 --> 3939.2799999999997
i'm not insecure about my hair

3944.559 --> 3948.1600000000003
because it's it's not perfect anymore

3946.559 --> 3951.3590000000004
it's good enough though

3948.16 --> 3955.0389999999998
you know i go about and yeah i

3951.359 --> 3956.799
i i'd say i get plenty of looks from

3955.039 --> 3959.76
girls

3956.799 --> 3960.799
so don't you worry about that you know

3959.76 --> 3964.6400000000003
the way i look

3960.799 --> 3968.0
the way i compose myself the way

3964.64 --> 3968.0
i dress even

3968.24 --> 3976.319
the jewels that i wear

3971.44 --> 3976.319
ring and my serious composure

3976.72 --> 3980.9599999999996
right that's that's plenty of attractive

3980.16 --> 3984.0
compared to

3980.96 --> 3988.319
what else is out there like all the

3984.0 --> 3991.359
pajama wearing old faced soy boys and

3988.319 --> 3995.68
weirdos with masks on and [ __ ]

3991.359 --> 3996.319
yeah so i'm not insecure about the way i

3995.68 --> 4000.24
look

3996.319 --> 4003.2799999999997
yeah i might not have i might be at like

4000.24 --> 4006.5589999999997
95 percent hair compared to what i was

4003.28 --> 4010.88
when i was 20 when it was

4006.559 --> 4014.1600000000003
like 98 99

4010.88 --> 4014.559
but guess what i'm freaking 40 and i

4014.16 --> 4018.48
have

4014.559 --> 4022.3190000000004
a lot more hair than most people

4018.48 --> 4026.72
most men of my age i'm not worried

4022.319 --> 4031.44
i'm really not worried i'm great

4026.72 --> 4035.4399999999996
i look amazing for a 40 year old

4031.44 --> 4036.48
okay i'm not i'm not insecure about the

4035.44 --> 4041.039
way i look

4036.48 --> 4041.039
i'm more insecure about

4041.2 --> 4046.16
well very stupid [ __ ] like not having

4043.68 --> 4048.72
enough money

4046.16 --> 4051.1189999999997
like i want to step to a girl and i just

4048.72 --> 4053.359
my instinct just says i want to freaking

4051.119 --> 4055.92
worship her and just shower her with

4053.359 --> 4058.5589999999997
mind-blowing gifts and [ __ ]

4055.92 --> 4060.319
right that's what my instinct wants and

4058.559 --> 4063.76
then it's like yeah but you

4060.319 --> 4067.119
you have to survive barely

4063.76 --> 4069.44
like you've specialized into low money

4067.119 --> 4072.079
survival so that's not the way it is

4069.44 --> 4074.4
so yeah it's not going to be that easy

4072.079 --> 4074.4
for me

4074.839 --> 4081.359
right

4077.359 --> 4083.119
see see

4081.359 --> 4085.44
you don't have to time it out good

4083.119 --> 4087.44
servant

4085.44 --> 4089.44
see how that works

4087.44 --> 4092.64
[Music]

4089.44 --> 4095.359
because i'm not afraid i'm

4092.64 --> 4099.04
really not afraid i've opened the door

4095.359 --> 4099.04
i'm honest about how i look

4100.799 --> 4105.839
and i'm quite satisfied

4130.839 --> 4137.6
this all right

4134.319 --> 4139.6
well thanks neil i appreciate it i think

4137.6 --> 4143.839
you're probably right the problem is i'm

4139.6 --> 4144.2390000000005
very hesitant it and it's also because i

4143.839 --> 4148.159
think

4144.239 --> 4152.08
just my ex kind of just ruined me

4148.159 --> 4154.879999999999
it's like you know

4152.08 --> 4156.88
so there it has to be really a legendary

4154.88 --> 4161.1990000000005
woman and it just has to

4156.88 --> 4162.2390000000005
be equal level and i have to be ready

4161.199 --> 4164.5599999999995
for that

4162.239 --> 4164.5599999999995
because

4165.359 --> 4168.400000000001
i feel like i'm not entirely complete

4167.44 --> 4171.5199999999995
yet

4168.4 --> 4174.4
in my own ascension

4171.52 --> 4175.839000000001
like i have to figure out how to get by

4174.4 --> 4179.199
better

4175.839 --> 4180.719
you know just doing this and asking you

4179.199 --> 4184.879999999999
guys for funds

4180.719 --> 4189.04
to get by it's kind of working

4184.88 --> 4191.679
but it doesn't just feel right yet

4189.04 --> 4191.679
just yet

4193.679 --> 4198.159
or maybe i just have to get used to it

4196.08 --> 4203.199
more

4198.159 --> 4207.04
i don't know i'm gonna try

4203.199 --> 4207.04
to see how long i can keep it up

4209.6 --> 4213.52
but yeah as far as girls go i i don't

4212.08 --> 4217.28
know

4213.52 --> 4220.320000000001
there's plenty of cute it's just that

4217.28 --> 4220.32
well they're women

4220.8 --> 4225.76
and you should never take a woman

4222.4 --> 4230.96
lightly especially if i like her

4225.76 --> 4237.360000000001
and then i don't know

4230.96 --> 4237.36
ew that's a terrible advice aries 106.

4242.84 --> 4249.679
terrible

4245.52 --> 4251.92
proper work what what kind of proper

4249.679 --> 4251.92
work

4252.719 --> 4256.84
is why is this not proper work i put

4255.84 --> 4261.04
down

4256.84 --> 4264.159000000001
conceptions i teach things

4261.04 --> 4266.8
i dig through yeah i

4264.159 --> 4268.799999999999
dude i do so much here it's just

4266.8 --> 4272.159000000001
ridiculous

4268.8 --> 4275.04
like that doesn't even work anymore why

4272.159 --> 4278.96
don't you get a proper job

4275.04 --> 4281.679
like this is i'm getting by it works

4278.96 --> 4283.92
and it's actually satisfying i learn a

4281.679 --> 4285.28
lot i develop skills i get better at a

4283.92 --> 4288.08
lot of things

4285.28 --> 4290.48
and i will be able to utilize for a lot

4288.08 --> 4293.92
of things out there

4290.48 --> 4296.5599999999995
for one composure confidence yeah

4293.92 --> 4297.36
it's pretty damn unshakable when i'm

4296.56 --> 4300.96
actually

4297.36 --> 4305.759999999999
decided upon something right

4300.96 --> 4305.76
that's not a universal skill

4307.12 --> 4323.55
that's not how most people do it

4314.159 --> 4326.619
what the hell

4323.55 --> 4326.619000000001
[Music]

4326.84 --> 4329.84
hmm

4331.92 --> 4334.88
it's pretty pathetic

4337.44 --> 4345.678999999999
can people get usable qualifications

4342.4 --> 4348.879999999999
yes yes they could

4345.679 --> 4352.159
definitely you know

4348.88 --> 4355.6
qualifications for life for

4352.159 --> 4357.44
figuring things out for fixing problems

4355.6 --> 4359.52
with other people

4357.44 --> 4361.44
for fixing problems with yourself and

4359.52 --> 4363.52
becoming a lot better person yeah

4361.44 --> 4364.639999999999
there's all kinds of qualifications you

4363.52 --> 4371.84
can get

4364.64 --> 4371.84
from watching this show

4378.96 --> 4385.84
anything else

4397.92 --> 4404.88
or did the trolls run out of gas did

4401.04 --> 4404.88
they sink back into the swamp again

4406.08 --> 4413.199
oh so now it's just at home

4409.28 --> 4414.48
haircuts no no i'm not gonna get a

4413.199 --> 4417.678999999999
haircut

4414.48 --> 4422.32
i haven't had a haircut

4417.679 --> 4425.92
in wow in 30 years

4422.32 --> 4426.719
yeah not a single one i will never cut

4425.92 --> 4431.84
my hair off

4426.719 --> 4431.84
ever ever i will have long hair

4432.0 --> 4435.76
on my corpse in the grave hopefully in

4434.88 --> 4438.8
the grave

4435.76 --> 4441.4400000000005
not burned up in some urn i don't want

4438.8 --> 4443.28
to be cremated thanks

4441.44 --> 4444.879999999999
but yeah i don't know if there's going

4443.28 --> 4447.84
to be that option even you know

4444.88 --> 4449.679
who knows in the in the future they will

4447.84 --> 4450.4800000000005
just freaking recycle people or

4449.679 --> 4453.4400000000005
something

4450.48 --> 4455.839999999999
like soylent green disgusting [ __ ] i

4453.44 --> 4455.839999999999
don't know

4458.92 --> 4462.119
[Music]

4484.96 --> 4487.36
wow

4488.0 --> 4490.64
look at that

4491.28 --> 4497.84
is that is there just a whole bunch of

4494.08 --> 4497.84
cockroaches coming out

4498.159 --> 4502.719
how many people are now in chat just

4500.96 --> 4505.52
squirting

4502.719 --> 4505.52
it's amazing

4507.44 --> 4510.96
i haven't seen this level of trolls in a

4509.52 --> 4513.52
while

4510.96 --> 4514.64
must be the 666 i think it probably drew

4513.52 --> 4517.76
them and they were just

4514.64 --> 4520.64
hoping like

4517.76 --> 4521.04
hoping something's been hoping to to

4520.64 --> 4523.679
meet

4521.04 --> 4525.84
their god their god of absolute reversed

4523.679 --> 4525.84
world

4526.0 --> 4533.76
failure self-imposed victory

4529.6 --> 4536.4800000000005
but instead they just got good old me

4533.76 --> 4538.56
talking about truth and how to open the

4536.48 --> 4539.199
door how to ascend become a better

4538.56 --> 4542.4800000000005
person do

4539.199 --> 4544.48
exactly the opposite and yeah that

4542.48 --> 4546.32
gives out all kinds of allergic

4544.48 --> 4548.239
responses it's like

4546.32 --> 4549.599999999999
they're hoping to get some goodies and

4548.239 --> 4551.599999999999
then they got burned

4549.6 --> 4553.280000000001
they got burned on the spirit and now

4551.6 --> 4555.52
they have to squirt

4553.28 --> 4558.48
they have to they have to dim down that

4555.52 --> 4558.4800000000005
light they don't like it

4560.159 --> 4567.839999999999
right poor trolly bullies

4564.84 --> 4567.84
oh

4592.84 --> 4595.84
so

4599.52 --> 4604.56
[Music]

4602.0 --> 4606.8
that's hilarious oh you don't understand

4604.56 --> 4609.1990000000005
what science is i'm pretty sure

4606.8 --> 4612.08
but what you said earlier was pretty

4609.199 --> 4612.08
ridiculous though

4613.36 --> 4623.839999999999
mr jones

4636.0 --> 4642.96
like the gyroscope thing right

4639.04 --> 4646.8
yeah you know gyroscopes don't

4642.96 --> 4650.44
measure movement

4646.8 --> 4653.28
they register

4650.44 --> 4656.799999999999
orientation change

4653.28 --> 4659.28
they don't measure movement

4656.8 --> 4661.1990000000005
measure orientation change now if the

4659.28 --> 4664.0
earth was a globe

4661.199 --> 4664.719
that means that if the boat would move

4664.0 --> 4667.84
across

4664.719 --> 4671.36
the sphere earth

4667.84 --> 4673.92
that yeah as it would go

4671.36 --> 4676.799999999999
the gyroscope would gradually turn

4673.92 --> 4681.679
because when a gyroscope is spun up

4676.8 --> 4685.04
it changes or it stays in its exact

4681.679 --> 4685.84
geometrical orientation perfectly within

4685.04 --> 4689.28
space

4685.84 --> 4691.6
this is universal this is what it does

4689.28 --> 4694.8
that's why they use gyroscope it's for

4691.6 --> 4698.4800000000005
the orientation

4694.8 --> 4700.2390000000005
right well guess what

4698.48 --> 4701.919999999999
on the globe it would mean it would

4700.239 --> 4705.12
constantly be turning

4701.92 --> 4706.719
in relation to that globe

4705.12 --> 4708.8
because it's going in a circle right

4706.719 --> 4710.719
well in reality doesn't do that

4708.8 --> 4712.56
because you can spin up a gyroscope it

4710.719 --> 4716.56
can fly in a plane

4712.56 --> 4720.719
across across the entire realm

4716.56 --> 4724.2390000000005
and it will not change its orientation

4720.719 --> 4735.84
because the earth is flat

4724.239 --> 4735.839999999999
it's as simple as that

4746.84 --> 4751.04
yes

4748.239 --> 4751.599999999999
the horizon is not a physical thing it's

4751.04 --> 4755.04
not a

4751.6 --> 4758.2390000000005
leading edge of a sphere mr jones

4755.04 --> 4761.84
horizon is an apparent location it's a

4758.239 --> 4764.08
visual side effect and it is

4761.84 --> 4766.159000000001
universally where the sky meets the

4764.08 --> 4768.159
ground not literally meeting the ground

4766.159 --> 4770.159
but appearing to meet the ground

4768.159 --> 4771.92
because it's an optics effect it's not

4770.159 --> 4775.5199999999995
actually a geometric

4771.92 --> 4779.1990000000005
edge of a sphere because if it was

4775.52 --> 4782.159000000001
the edge of that sphere then certain

4779.199 --> 4784.239
sites could never be seen at any point

4782.159 --> 4787.199
because the geometry would not allow it

4784.239 --> 4788.48
and it's called the black swan that's

4787.199 --> 4793.04
what it's classified

4788.48 --> 4793.04
under because of the black swan fallacy

4793.84 --> 4802.84
if the earth was a specific sphere

4799.28 --> 4806.4
then you would never see certain

4802.84 --> 4809.4400000000005
things after a certain point

4806.4 --> 4812.5599999999995
at any time it would be impossible

4809.44 --> 4816.239
well we have photographs where you do

4812.56 --> 4816.2390000000005
absolutely like the oil

4817.28 --> 4824.96
the oil platform photographs you see it

4821.679 --> 4826.96
so yeah that means

4824.96 --> 4830.2390000000005
there's an exception to what is

4826.96 --> 4832.0
absolutely necessary for the geometry

4830.239 --> 4834.799999999999
and that means that the geometry is

4832.0 --> 4838.239
false so the earth is not that sphere

4834.8 --> 4847.76
for sure there's no way to overcome this

4838.239 --> 4850.48
and that's the black swan

4847.76 --> 4852.0
and if you're going to yell terrestrial

4850.48 --> 4853.599999999999
refraction well then you got an

4852.0 --> 4854.96
immediate problem because terrestrial

4853.6 --> 4858.0
refraction

4854.96 --> 4860.56
which suggests that light bends across

4858.0 --> 4866.239
the sphere in spherical fashion

4860.56 --> 4869.280000000001
is a paradox it's physically impossible

4866.239 --> 4872.879999999999
because if it exists then

4869.28 --> 4875.04
you could never establish the radius in

4872.88 --> 4878.32
the first place

4875.04 --> 4881.6
so it's always been a

4878.32 --> 4884.719
an afterward justification

4881.6 --> 4887.76
why the earth doesn't abide

4884.719 --> 4888.0
by the geometry of the sphere but if you

4887.76 --> 4890.88
would

4888.0 --> 4893.199
draw this seven over six or terrestrial

4890.88 --> 4896.4800000000005
fraction as a conclusion

4893.199 --> 4897.5199999999995
then you could never prove that it

4896.48 --> 4899.919999999999
exists

4897.52 --> 4901.120000000001
like if it exists it could never be

4899.92 --> 4905.28
proven

4901.12 --> 4908.91
it's impossible to be proven

4905.28 --> 4910.88
terrestrial refraction it's a paradox

4908.91 --> 4913.599999999999
[Music]

4910.88 --> 4914.159000000001
so yeah the earth is not a sphere black

4913.6 --> 4918.159000000001
swan

4914.159 --> 4918.159
terrestrial fraction is a paradox

4920.0 --> 4931.84
that's where we're at 2020.

4942.84 --> 4949.04
ugh

4945.84 --> 4950.639
wow i think i think these are like the

4949.04 --> 4953.679
flatter debate

4950.639 --> 4955.84
trolls i don't know

4953.679 --> 4959.84
what where are these people who are

4955.84 --> 4959.84
these people

4960.48 --> 4973.839999999999
gonna be pretty disgusting to go there

4963.52 --> 4973.84
in your mind you know

4975.64 --> 4978.81
[Music]

4984.84 --> 4987.84
right

4997.04 --> 5004.48
neil cosentino don't think

5000.719 --> 5007.92
well maybe you're maybe mr jones maybe

5004.48 --> 5010.959999999999
well he might do that who knows oh

5007.92 --> 5012.96
oh really mr j uh never mind

5010.96 --> 5015.44
if he's gonna say something you he

5012.96 --> 5018.159
debunked nathan

5015.44 --> 5021.678999999999
how can you debunk a person did you

5018.159 --> 5021.679
debunk any of his arguments

5026.32 --> 5031.04
i don't think so if you address the

5029.12 --> 5034.96
housekeeping questions

5031.04 --> 5034.96
did you address anything that i said

5035.76 --> 5039.679
i just explained how it works right

5040.32 --> 5043.5199999999995
you asked for your best my best piece of

5042.8 --> 5046.719
evidence i

5043.52 --> 5048.719
gave it to you now so you're just going

5046.719 --> 5052.08
to repeat the question again

5048.719 --> 5054.4
i already explained it to you since

5052.08 --> 5055.28
you can't rump us me because you're not

5054.4 --> 5058.08
audible

5055.28 --> 5059.679
you're just in chat everybody could hear

5058.08 --> 5062.5599999999995
what i said perfectly

5059.679 --> 5063.84
so i yeah i answered you that's it the

5062.56 --> 5065.4400000000005
earth is flat

5063.84 --> 5067.28
because it can't be a sphere because of

5065.44 --> 5071.839999999999
the black swan and terrestrial

5067.28 --> 5071.84
refraction is a paradox

5073.6 --> 5084.320000000001
and now that's just about the

5075.6 --> 5085.679
geometrical orientation

5084.32 --> 5087.5199999999995
right because it doesn't even say

5085.679 --> 5090.159
anything about the content of the realm

5087.52 --> 5092.88
or how the electrics work or why the

5090.159 --> 5094.48
heavenly bodies and all that

5092.88 --> 5097.04
it's just about the geometrical

5094.48 --> 5098.0
orientation of the earth's surface which

5097.04 --> 5100.96
is really what

5098.0 --> 5101.84
is the big triggering point because the

5100.96 --> 5104.08
ballers

5101.84 --> 5105.28
just want the ball they want the ball

5104.08 --> 5108.08
they they don't want

5105.28 --> 5110.8
they don't want a flat they want a ball

5108.08 --> 5110.8
i want a ball

5110.84 --> 5117.1990000000005
right they want

5114.08 --> 5122.08
satan's little ball

5117.199 --> 5125.599999999999
in endless space that's what they want

5122.08 --> 5128.5599999999995
and they're not letting go can't get the

5125.6 --> 5128.56
ball out of their head

5138.639 --> 5155.84
okay yeah yeah it's time to uh it's time

5141.52 --> 5155.84
to go

5168.88 --> 5175.92
look at that look at them squirt

5172.639 --> 5175.92
they're really desperate

5180.48 --> 5185.04
they're they're in so much pain i've

5182.4 --> 5185.04
never seen
