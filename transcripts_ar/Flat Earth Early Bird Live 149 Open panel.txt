38.09 --> 46.14
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.94 --> 50.91
early-bird number 149 I'm your host

46.14 --> 53.58
Arwen and today is yet another glorious

50.91 --> 57.209999999999994
spring day it feels really like summer

53.58 --> 61.71
it's even warmer than yesterday oh my

57.21 --> 64.29
god just full Sun I haven't seen any

61.71 --> 67.47
chemtrails so far but they may have

64.29 --> 72.27000000000001
sprayed some earlier it's just a really

67.47 --> 77.25
warm sunny and also the tree down there

72.27 --> 79.02
it's now yeah popping I think like in

77.25 --> 82.25
the next two days it's going to be full

79.02 --> 88.17
blooming I will do a spring update video

82.25 --> 91.74
just like last year and yeah what a day

88.17 --> 94.35
just sitting on my balcony in the Sun

91.74 --> 98.88
just with my t-shirt and it's freaking

94.35 --> 101.30999999999999
hot oh and it's warm in here as well

98.88 --> 102.17
very warm like even with the door open

101.31 --> 108.209
like this

102.17 --> 112.56
oof so yeah I was going to have GM truth

108.209 --> 116.28
TV on but yeah last I heard from him was

112.56 --> 119.52
last night and I think I don't know if

116.28 --> 122.009
he's like Californian on the west coast

119.52 --> 124.319
or on the east coast could be that he's

122.009 --> 125.94
a West Coast ER and yeah it's gonna be

124.319 --> 129.06
so early for him I wouldn't blame him

125.94 --> 131.54
that he wouldn't be able to just get up

129.06 --> 134.94
this early the guys probably very busy

131.54 --> 137.91
so you will see when when he gets on

134.94 --> 141.629
maybe he will get on as the show

137.91 --> 149.95
progresses or maybe we have to get him

141.629 --> 152.709
on a night owl show why not why not so

149.95 --> 156.13
yeah also have been watching some of his

152.709 --> 162.31
videos we're interesting clear very

156.13 --> 164.82999999999998
short videos overall and yeah he seems

162.31 --> 167.83
like a very well studied person that

164.83 --> 172.33
really lines out a subject specifically

167.83 --> 174.31
like a curriculum almost and yeah he has

172.33 --> 177.43
an entire piece about the scientific

174.31 --> 181.87
method and everything and like whoa this

177.43 --> 186.43
guy really gets it gets it the same way

181.87 --> 190.87
I do what some ballers like to call or

186.43 --> 193.81
some yeah and flat-earthers the John

190.87 --> 196.39000000000001
method but yeah that is the method

193.81 --> 196.959
whether John came to the scene with it

196.39 --> 199.319
first

196.959 --> 202.39000000000001
or somebody else that is the method and

199.319 --> 204.57999999999998
GM truth TV gets it as well and made a

202.39 --> 210.42999999999998
couple of videos about it so do check

204.58 --> 213.37
him out and yeah he is also very

210.43 --> 215.859
interesting views on Christianity it's

213.37 --> 219.43
weird he says it's like a blood cult and

215.859 --> 227.019
yeah since well since Jesus Christ first

219.43 --> 231.519
came presumably I I presume it that yeah

227.019 --> 234.64000000000001
so much has happened with with all that

231.519 --> 240.42000000000002
with the scriptures with the Catholic

234.64 --> 245.10899999999998
Church first like you the theocratic

240.42 --> 246.94
Empire basically and yeah it's just so

245.109 --> 250.299
much happened so I wouldn't blame him

246.94 --> 253.359
but yeah I wanted I won't discuss this

250.299 --> 255.79000000000002
subject more in depth with him and see

253.359 --> 257.89
what he thinks about my eclectic method

255.79 --> 261.7
of Christianity

257.89 --> 268.63
yeah which does not impress emphasize as

261.7 --> 271.06
yeah certain older concepts but yes sir

268.63 --> 273.61
Oh old approaches to the Scriptures but

271.06 --> 276.57
really the emphasis of Jesus Christ

273.61 --> 279.43
himself as a person and what he did and

276.57 --> 281.89
then of course the the teachings of

279.43 --> 283.90000000000003
Rudolf Steiner and the spiritual

281.89 --> 287.08
approach like

283.9 --> 288.90999999999997
with the seducing spirits and everything

287.08 --> 292.15
in sort of a yeah

288.91 --> 293.83000000000004
a a more tangible setup and I'm very

292.15 --> 295.57
curious as to what he thinks about it

293.83 --> 297.07
and if you hadn't heard I'll just

295.57 --> 301.54
explain it like I always do

297.07 --> 303.46
I'm very curious so but yeah maybe not

301.54 --> 305.83000000000004
today maybe not this morning

303.46 --> 309.54999999999995
maybe this evening or tomorrow evening

305.83 --> 321.72999999999996
we'll see what happens anyway for now

309.55 --> 324.76
you'll just have to do with me it's kind

321.73 --> 329.11
of weird though that with this great

324.76 --> 333.13
weather now arriving again I still feel

329.11 --> 335.08000000000004
almost kind of sickly it's weird this

333.13 --> 338.11
time I can't blame any alcohol or

335.08 --> 339.15999999999997
anything maybe it's just going to bed

338.11 --> 345.22
way too late

339.16 --> 350.49
like yesterday was to wait too late like

345.22 --> 353.05
I can advise anyone don't turn on a

350.49 --> 355.54
two-and-a-half-hour Al Pacino movie that

353.05 --> 357.67
you've never seen before and think you

355.54 --> 359.11
can just look at the few minutes and

357.67 --> 361.36
then turn it off and go to bed I

359.11 --> 363.31
wouldn't recommend it it was very dumb

361.36 --> 365.43
of me I should have known like oh [Â __Â ]

363.31 --> 368.47
Al Pacino this is going to be gripping

365.43 --> 373.24
no matter the story really because he is

368.47 --> 375.16
just such a fabulous actor and yeah that

373.24 --> 377.89
kept me up two and a half hours I think

375.16 --> 383.8
was kind of stupid it was a good movie

377.89 --> 387.24
though very interesting title the smell

383.8 --> 392.55
of women and Al Pacino's plays this

387.24 --> 397.8
blinded war veteran it's very much about

392.55 --> 397.8
yeah morality a personal struggle and

398.34 --> 407.06
yeah and the guy like war traumas that

404.15 --> 409.07
made him very depressed and that plays a

407.06 --> 413.09
big role in it as well it's a very

409.07 --> 415.639
cleverly told story big Oscar winners

413.09 --> 417.919
and all that so yeah well deserved it

415.639 --> 420.229
was a good movie but don't start

417.919 --> 423.669
watching it and think you can just watch

420.229 --> 428.34999999999997
five minutes of it and then walk away

423.669 --> 428.34999999999997
yeah at the end of a moan awful woman I

428.8 --> 438.07
don't know it yeah it the title kind of

434.3 --> 441.61
appealed to me because I myself - I

438.07 --> 441.61
don't know I get that

443.41 --> 449.71000000000004
I'm very smell orientated person myself

455.95 --> 462.59
alright the visuals have to be right

459.1 --> 464.99
smell also anyway yeah I don't know

462.59 --> 466.96999999999997
maybe I've I've just I'm the spring is

464.99 --> 469.7
getting to me and I've been saying over

466.97 --> 472.46000000000004
five years so I guess thought like in

469.7 --> 476.12
there let's see if this is kind of

472.46 --> 480.169
inspires me and it did very much like Al

476.12 --> 484.91
Pacino is such a freaking it's just such

480.169 --> 488.09
a freakin genius and yeah it was

484.91 --> 490.43
fascinating to see like several times or

488.09 --> 494.81
at least one time really big time you

490.43 --> 496.639
basically picked up a girl for ya the

494.81 --> 501.77
much younger guy that was kind of his

496.639 --> 503.419
guide and just like how he did it was

501.77 --> 506.479
very convincing of course it was all

503.419 --> 508.25
acted but yeah there was chemistry

506.479 --> 510.65
because it's freaking out but she knows

508.25 --> 514.76
it just doesn't matter if it's act it's

510.65 --> 517.31
just very impressive personally me I've

514.76 --> 519.56
never really been good at picking up

517.31 --> 525.4399999999999
girls like I never have learned to use

519.56 --> 529.52
that skill I'm like a freezer and I mean

525.44 --> 531.1700000000001
yeah I freeze up it's just I turn into

529.52 --> 533.24
shine mode when I'm like really

531.17 --> 535.13
attracted to women that's annoying

533.24 --> 536.4
although yeah with some women do

535.13 --> 538.41
recognize that and

536.4 --> 543.15
I find it charming and that is kind of

538.41 --> 546.27
got me through it all I guess but

543.15 --> 550.8299999999999
sometimes I do wish I had like this full

546.27 --> 553.9499999999999
smooth movement moves just you know what

550.83 --> 555.75
to say but that you can also just do it

553.95 --> 566.88
with conviction that's just very

555.75 --> 569.82
impressive to me anyway I'm not praising

566.88 --> 571.89
any idols I'm just I have respect for

569.82 --> 577.08
the man straight he's a really good

571.89 --> 581.43
actor and he inspires me doesn't really

577.08 --> 583.2
matter what his beliefs are what he

581.43 --> 585.8599999999999
acted out and he did it very

583.2 --> 585.86
convincingly

591.98 --> 599.0
anyway let's take a look at jet it's

596.339 --> 599.0
piled on

601.14 --> 610.1999999999999
all right so in order hello Steve

604.32 --> 614.399
drunken bullet for one one glass jaw I

610.2 --> 625.61
killed the hope and my UK youth Anders

614.399 --> 625.61
ace Swan say a 1984 AGM

629.45 --> 641.21
ranty exclamation mark is that is that

633.95 --> 648.7700000000001
the real Randi a Julie Bennett anyway

641.21 --> 657.94
mark or oh yeah it is in damn Randy you

648.77 --> 657.9399999999999
gotta tell us what happened Ober Michael

659.32 --> 666.88
Jordan alias for one one no wait yeah

663.88 --> 666.88
yeah

674.47 --> 680.44
all right well AGM you know what in

678.4 --> 683.56
general with a lot of movies you're

680.44 --> 691.09
right but yeah don't judge this movie

683.56 --> 694.26
it's actually very morally upright so if

691.09 --> 696.97
you see how the world is right now

694.26 --> 699.0699999999999
thanks to these same people that are

696.97 --> 703.89
delivering this message though it is

699.07 --> 703.8900000000001
kinda two-faced like criticizing

704.25 --> 710.83
universities - yeah push in decent

709.24 --> 713.5600000000001
behavior that kind of thing to be

710.83 --> 716.26
snitches that's very typical that they

713.56 --> 718.3299999999999
would criticize that when yeah liberals

716.26 --> 720.79
all over the place and Hollywood

718.33 --> 722.95
supporters and all that and that that

720.79 --> 724.48
political group is now literally doing

722.95 --> 726.25
that yeah when you look at that like

724.48 --> 729.49
that it's very annoying

726.25 --> 731.59
but fortunately I can kind of suspend my

729.49 --> 738.88
disbelief and do realize this is another

731.59 --> 742.3000000000001
time it is much older movie so I don't

738.88 --> 744.73
know I'm not I can still enjoy things

742.3 --> 746.9799999999999
just like I can still enjoy science

744.73 --> 750.54
fiction even though I know who made it

746.98 --> 757.0600000000001
and why and everything else that's all

750.54 --> 761.37
woven into it you know I know it doesn't

757.06 --> 764.18
mean that I can't enjoy aspects of it

761.37 --> 764.18
so

774.16 --> 784.29
No into musica ball and sucker count

797.55 --> 804.4599999999999
well hello yeah Jordan alias that's an

802.15 --> 809.14
interesting question yeah you can kind

804.46 --> 811.72
of do it but don't go sitting in the

809.14 --> 813.85
middle of a park where it's like totally

811.72 --> 815.23
full with families and children's and

813.85 --> 818.14
you're going to like a light up a joint

815.23 --> 821.08
right next to them then that's very

818.14 --> 823.33
offensive you have to do it kind of a

821.08 --> 825.73
private when you don't bother too many

823.33 --> 827.7700000000001
people the smell carries and yeah you

825.73 --> 835.26
don't do it next to children kind of

827.77 --> 837.5799999999999
thing but now there's rarely any kind of

835.26 --> 839.01
fighting going on involving with

837.58 --> 842.01
cannabis in the Netherlands

839.01 --> 842.01
ever

850.6 --> 855.97
but yeah you like if you're gonna smoke

853.27 --> 857.92
a joint for example in Amsterdam walking

855.97 --> 861.01
on the sidewalk in between all those

857.92 --> 864.31
people and sometimes yeah some people do

861.01 --> 867.27
do that sneakily but yeah if you do get

864.31 --> 872.5899999999999
caught by the police you will get a fine

867.27 --> 877.4499999999999
so officially it's not allowed in public

872.59 --> 878.98
areas even outside but yeah if you just

877.45 --> 880.99
do it secluded where you're not

878.98 --> 882.8100000000001
bothering anyone nobody's really gonna

880.99 --> 885.04
complain about it there they're already

882.81 --> 887.2299999999999
kind of happy that you're at least

885.04 --> 889.9
trying not to bother people because

887.23 --> 898.1800000000001
there are a lot of antisocial people out

889.9 --> 900.73
there and junkies that just yeah so it's

898.18 --> 904.2299999999999
more a matter of your behavior than if

900.73 --> 904.23
you are using something

911.45 --> 913.48
I

914.74 --> 923.14
dysfunctional they did have cannabis

918.98 --> 926.24
smoke free zones I don't know that's

923.14 --> 928.22
that's a weird thing to say it's not

926.24 --> 932.089
allowed everywhere like you can't smell

928.22 --> 935.63
cannabis in cafes or it's you can just

932.089 --> 937.7
do it at home or like outside on the

935.63 --> 943.1899999999999
balcony as long it's not really

937.7 --> 945.589
bothering people and in parks and

943.19 --> 949.49
everything in public as long as you're

945.589 --> 952.24
not bothering people with it that's

949.49 --> 952.24
pretty much it

958.49 --> 963.4
oh they are Nathan's having technical

961.13 --> 963.4
issues

964.49 --> 970.73
Nathan Oakley I wouldn't know I I don't

968.39 --> 974.03
even ask I do know in Amsterdam that I

970.73 --> 976.64
but could be because of my looks that

974.03 --> 979.99
regularly like these weirdos bump into

976.64 --> 984.5
me and are like oh you wanted by some

979.99 --> 985.25
buy something pills or [Â __Â ] like that's

984.5 --> 988.37
yeah

985.25 --> 989.99
drug dealing does go on there and you if

988.37 --> 995.35
you want to find crack you could

989.99 --> 995.35
probably get it if that is what you want

1002.09 --> 1009.71
but yeah now there's not a lot of

1004.46 --> 1012.8000000000001
correct junkies out here as far as I

1009.71 --> 1015.47
know I don't know in Utrecht we see them

1012.8 --> 1018.05
rarely it's most mostly just kind of

1015.47 --> 1021.74
like bums people that are just slightly

1018.05 --> 1025.28
mentally deficient not also alcoholics

1021.74 --> 1028.82
you do have I do see those every now and

1025.28 --> 1032.3
then but yeah it's nothing like

1028.82 --> 1046.79
Amsterdam a lot more goes on there it's

1032.3 --> 1049.57
a lot more crowded as well a GM don't be

1046.79 --> 1049.57
self indicative

1055.3 --> 1064.04
all right yeah dysfunctional a good

1058.19 --> 1067.3400000000001
point well that was a notorious problem

1064.04 --> 1070.69
here in Utrecht a decade ago or two

1067.34 --> 1074.84
decades ago but they've totally rebuilt

1070.69 --> 1078.41
things at the Central Station and I

1074.84 --> 1082.12
don't think yeah I think they pretty

1078.41 --> 1084.95
much moved them somewhere else and

1082.12 --> 1091.4289999999999
there's a lot of places here in Utrecht

1084.95 --> 1095.0
anyway like social workers and functions

1091.429 --> 1095.96
and places where people with problems

1095.0 --> 1097.96
can be helped

1095.96 --> 1103.55
including junkies like they're very

1097.96 --> 1106.3400000000001
carrying here in an organized way so I

1103.55 --> 1109.28
think they just they're treating it in a

1106.34 --> 1113.75
different way and it's not like droves

1109.28 --> 1115.94
of off junkies like it used to be here I

1113.75 --> 1120.95
haven't seen any of those could attach

1115.94 --> 1123.29
the groups in a long time so but I don't

1120.95 --> 1125.96
know maybe some of the bums are heroin

1123.29 --> 1128.33
junkies or they used to be it certainly

1125.96 --> 1132.23
looked like they could have been but

1128.33 --> 1135.53
they yeah I don't like fine

1132.23 --> 1137.72
like really wide-eyed weirdos that are

1135.53 --> 1139.67
just like a half catatonic somewhat you

1137.72 --> 1142.79
don't see that here I never seen that

1139.67 --> 1145.01
here in the streets and in the parks but

1142.79 --> 1146.75
yeah on the other hand maybe if I go

1145.01 --> 1149.179
look in certain other types of park

1146.75 --> 1152.39
regions I will find some of these people

1149.179 --> 1155.99
there but yeah where I go and I do get

1152.39 --> 1158.69
around a little I never really bump into

1155.99 --> 1161.33
them anymore and I do go on a bicycle

1158.69 --> 1165.53
and I do definitely pay attention a lot

1161.33 --> 1167.72
I don't have any music on I don't use

1165.53 --> 1169.94
never use you know my mobile I just

1167.72 --> 1172.49
freaking bike and I use my eyes and my

1169.94 --> 1175.46
senses all of them and I definitely look

1172.49 --> 1178.19
around me what's going on what what are

1175.46 --> 1180.71
the people like of every generation

1178.19 --> 1183.24
what's going on I'm just yeah that

1180.71 --> 1186.31
that's what I do

1183.24 --> 1190.15
and there by the way is a lot of like

1186.31 --> 1193.09
dealing going on as well like youngsters

1190.15 --> 1198.22
I think in between their teens and their

1193.09 --> 1202.36
30s that are just obviously like non

1198.22 --> 1205.8700000000001
violent gangs that are just drug-dealing

1202.36 --> 1209.56
the [Â __Â ] out of the place but yeah

1205.87 --> 1211.6299999999999
they're not really bothering anyone so

1209.56 --> 1213.73
they're not like walking around with

1211.63 --> 1215.7700000000002
guns and [Â __Â ] as far as I know there's a

1213.73 --> 1218.07
lot of police moving around I don't know

1215.77 --> 1218.07
it just

1222.16 --> 1227.44
I don't have anything really - very

1225.07 --> 1232.4099999999999
seriously complain about in Utrecht when

1227.44 --> 1232.41
it comes to the the social climate much

1235.56 --> 1243.8799999999999
yeah in Netherlands it's more like the

1239.55 --> 1247.3899999999999
the national politics that's a big

1243.88 --> 1249.73
problem I think but the local politics

1247.39 --> 1251.68
I'll hear at least I don't know I can't

1249.73 --> 1253.66
find anything that directly complain

1251.68 --> 1256.3300000000002
about really badly although look I

1253.66 --> 1259.45
haven't really read into everything that

1256.33 --> 1263.53
they do but from what I can see looks

1259.45 --> 1268.1100000000001
pretty good well right

1263.53 --> 1268.11
peanuts Clark okay if you link

1289.44 --> 1292.22
all right

1294.12 --> 1302.82
okay sir peanuts clerk may be may be

1297.63 --> 1305.6000000000001
popping in any moment all right so let's

1302.82 --> 1305.6
see what else

1323.24 --> 1334.1490000000001
oh yeah watch the zoom podcast thingy

1328.809 --> 1334.149
from Travis as well I was interesting

1337.25 --> 1344.659
oh yeah and odd like Owen Benjamin did a

1341.69 --> 1346.789
livestream and I did yeah I didn't watch

1344.659 --> 1348.8300000000002
it I thought like nah I'll wait til

1346.789 --> 1352.039
tomorrow you know it's late it's freakin

1348.83 --> 1356.6499999999999
late enough and now I'm looking today

1352.039 --> 1358.6299999999999
and it's gone that was so disappointing

1356.65 --> 1363.2
low peanuts

1358.63 --> 1368.39
hey good morning to ya for me it's

1363.2 --> 1372.0800000000002
afternoon but yeah how you do so I'm

1368.39 --> 1374.6000000000001
okay you a caught part of your live

1372.08 --> 1377.4189999999999
stream and you were talking about Palos

1374.6 --> 1381.32
and crack oh yeah some people got

1377.419 --> 1386.0
talking about drugs and and Amsterdam

1381.32 --> 1388.52
and referencing a problem that was here

1386.0 --> 1391.159
in Utrecht like a decade and more ago

1388.52 --> 1395.02
with junkies hanging around to Central

1391.159 --> 1398.69
Station a lot yeah but I thought like no

1395.02 --> 1401.6299999999999
they've kind of fixed it and you have to

1398.69 --> 1403.429
give credit where credit is due and so

1401.63 --> 1409.0900000000001
yeah I thought I'd elaborate on the

1403.429 --> 1412.8500000000001
situation here in my city gosh yeah oh

1409.09 --> 1415.1299999999999
man I just yeah I don't know I kind of

1412.85 --> 1419.9289999999999
heard you say that no it's like that's

1415.13 --> 1422.5100000000002
not like Harlan sorry that is what oh

1419.929 --> 1424.88
it's just like hey I guess I didn't get

1422.51 --> 1426.95
the context of it so when I when I

1424.88 --> 1430.2800000000002
popped in I heard you saying it but I

1426.95 --> 1436.28
didn't get the three contexts alright

1430.28 --> 1440.9289999999999
okay I was just responding to chat a

1436.28 --> 1447.62
little and I got you I got how was your

1440.929 --> 1454.49
weekend pretty much like any other day

1447.62 --> 1456.86
really but yeah it was good at a really

1454.49 --> 1458.84
interesting time on ball-busters when I

1456.86 --> 1461.559
was there and it was kind of drunk and

1458.84 --> 1464.12
but I still had a lot of momentum and I

1461.559 --> 1465.71
figured out some new interesting stuff I

1464.12 --> 1468.559
don't know if you've heard about it I

1465.71 --> 1470.63
mentioned it yesterday at least but the

1468.559 --> 1475.94
concept that light may not

1470.63 --> 1480.0800000000002
be indivisible photonic units but

1475.94 --> 1482.48
actually that the photon energy quantity

1480.08 --> 1483.3799999999999
the quanta is based on the minimum

1482.48 --> 1487.19
registerable

1483.38 --> 1490.0100000000002
amount in a certain process and yeah

1487.19 --> 1493.0
that's a new project new physics project

1490.01 --> 1496.16
basically that I'm now looking into and

1493.0 --> 1498.92
seeing if that if it if it has always

1496.16 --> 1502.6100000000001
been a presupposition that photons are

1498.92 --> 1504.74
indivisible energy units and I want to

1502.61 --> 1506.8999999999999
make sure if that is really the case or

1504.74 --> 1510.98
if it is what I presume to be and that

1506.9 --> 1513.74
is just a spectrum of energy that it's

1510.98 --> 1516.59
not it's much more flexible compared to

1513.74 --> 1521.15
the concepts of literal physical

1516.59 --> 1523.07
molecules so that's a beam that can just

1521.15 --> 1525.74
have a certain intensity and the way

1523.07 --> 1529.1
matter will respond to it will still be

1525.74 --> 1530.93
confined to the molecular base so there

1529.1 --> 1534.79
will be critical mass when certain

1530.93 --> 1539.42
processes happen but the light itself

1534.79 --> 1543.47
may not necessarily be yeah consistent

1539.42 --> 1546.8300000000002
of in device indivisible units see

1543.47 --> 1552.08
photons like energy units so I proposed

1546.83 --> 1555.26
what if one-and-a-half photon intensity

1552.08 --> 1558.76
has been registered in a single blip for

1555.26 --> 1558.76
example how do you explain that

1558.79 --> 1566.54
but yeah nobody's really gotten back to

1561.59 --> 1568.55
that concept yet to me but I got into it

1566.54 --> 1571.49
with on ball-busters

1568.55 --> 1573.2
a little and I got like respond oh no

1571.49 --> 1575.21
it's all be worked out sound sorry

1573.2 --> 1577.78
familiar sounds like just like

1575.21 --> 1581.0
patrollers say when they're tested and

1577.78 --> 1583.79
yeah I got a video it wasn't convincing

1581.0 --> 1586.64
it basically reaffirmed what I thought

1583.79 --> 1593.18
was the case and so I'm still digging

1586.64 --> 1597.89
and yeah that's my new project so

1593.18 --> 1601.94
speaking on those terms so basically the

1597.89 --> 1603.74
Sun right and that's that's obviously

1601.94 --> 1607.1000000000001
where we're getting our energy

1603.74 --> 1614.24
and basically are you saying that that

1607.1 --> 1616.34
that mass is photons no okay maybe I

1614.24 --> 1618.74
didn't hear you correctly now talking

1616.34 --> 1623.029
about light light in general not just

1618.74 --> 1627.799
the Sun because I think that'd be some

1623.029 --> 1630.89
is not a physical object radiating light

1627.799 --> 1633.58
I think it's an apparition a like a lens

1630.89 --> 1637.279
flare or a rainbow a side effect that

1633.58 --> 1641.6
you get to see when you directly observe

1637.279 --> 1643.33
or look into the daylight yeah from the

1641.6 --> 1646.76
exact point where it's originating from

1643.33 --> 1651.86
in relation to the observer and that

1646.76 --> 1654.4089999999999
causes the apparent Sun disk effect but

1651.86 --> 1657.02
I was more referencing to the nature of

1654.409 --> 1661.3700000000001
what light is in general and I mean all

1657.02 --> 1666.37
light light what is it and I think it's

1661.37 --> 1666.37
not in the visible photonic units I

1666.549 --> 1674.12
think it's just a a beam of energy that

1670.75 --> 1676.07
that has a gradient basically by its own

1674.12 --> 1679.4799999999998
nature like a spectrum does and that's

1676.07 --> 1682.279
why it allows the refraction of light

1679.48 --> 1684.83
and these incredible effects like

1682.279 --> 1688.19
certainly different types of colors can

1684.83 --> 1691.9089999999999
come out of the same beam and then it's

1688.19 --> 1694.3400000000001
theorized that every beam as a separate

1691.909 --> 1699.5900000000001
type of photonic unit with its own

1694.34 --> 1701.4499999999998
energy but yeah how that's only after it

1699.59 --> 1704.24
split up so it's a deduction based

1701.45 --> 1708.47
reasoning well can you prove that when

1704.24 --> 1711.35
it is not split up I don't think see and

1708.47 --> 1714.1100000000001
it all points to that it's just dosages

1711.35 --> 1717.289
of energy depending on what arrives

1714.11 --> 1720.82
through the beam and the beam can be

1717.289 --> 1723.32
split up that can be absorbed yeah

1720.82 --> 1726.83
quantities of energy of it but I don't

1723.32 --> 1730.37
think that it is all invisible units

1726.83 --> 1734.6899999999998
that are being projected I think it's

1730.37 --> 1737.29
just a beam and a beam that can go to do

1734.69 --> 1741.91
all kinds of things split up

1737.29 --> 1745.8999999999999
be absorbed everything could it be

1741.91 --> 1750.0400000000002
possible that the energy is already here

1745.9 --> 1757.24
on earth and somehow the Sun makes it

1750.04 --> 1759.61
react that's a fascinating theory look

1757.24 --> 1761.74
when you consider light to be direct

1759.61 --> 1765.6689999999999
instantaneous beams that just they

1761.74 --> 1773.53
manifest and they spread until they are

1765.669 --> 1777.1200000000001
absorbed somehow yeah it's all a matter

1773.53 --> 1780.46
of approach yeah and even in this case

1777.12 --> 1782.4399999999998
yeah I don't know where how they are

1780.46 --> 1785.23
manifesting I don't know how these rays

1782.44 --> 1788.559
from the Sun are manifesting they're not

1785.23 --> 1791.44
like a typical earthly thing coming from

1788.559 --> 1793.51
a lamp as most people tend to presume

1791.44 --> 1796.0900000000001
very naturally because yeah that that is

1793.51 --> 1799.179
what we know that is what we can touch

1796.09 --> 1802.51
so that is a very logical starting point

1799.179 --> 1806.0800000000002
for most people but yeah the Sun just

1802.51 --> 1811.75
doesn't seem to act that way in my

1806.08 --> 1814.03
opinion and yeah then I have to ponder

1811.75 --> 1816.91
on well how is this light manifesting

1814.03 --> 1823.3899999999999
and I theorized it that it is almost

1816.91 --> 1825.19
like a a lamp effect but in midair or in

1823.39 --> 1828.7900000000002
the high atmosphere with with whatever

1825.19 --> 1831.76
is up there in gases or particles and

1828.79 --> 1836.11
that it's electrical nature so that it's

1831.76 --> 1839.32
like a a side effect of an electrical

1836.11 --> 1841.3899999999999
tension that has a specific pattern that

1839.32 --> 1844.78
causes the entire globe of the heavens

1841.39 --> 1847.0
and everything as we as we see it it's a

1844.78 --> 1852.9289999999999
miraculous electrical side effect

1847.0 --> 1852.929
basically that's how I conceptualize it

1854.69 --> 1863.49
it is interesting because the the

1861.66 --> 1869.5800000000002
narratives that we're getting that were

1863.49 --> 1874.41
given is basically the the Sun is giving

1869.58 --> 1876.96
his losing mass but it but if that was

1874.41 --> 1878.6100000000001
the case we would I think over a long

1876.96 --> 1882.57
period of time we would see the Sun gets

1878.61 --> 1889.53
smaller but that takes billions of years

1882.57 --> 1891.3899999999999
peanuts you know that all right yeah it

1889.53 --> 1894.54
is it is interesting because it's like

1891.39 --> 1896.94
is the energy already here on earth and

1894.54 --> 1900.24
that it needs the Sun or is the Sun

1896.94 --> 1903.27
providing everything that the earth yes

1900.24 --> 1905.34
well it is the daylight interaction with

1903.27 --> 1907.98
matter that causes so many of these

1905.34 --> 1910.4099999999999
processes that life is very much

1907.98 --> 1918.929
depended on including the generation of

1910.41 --> 1922.1000000000001
heat and what's the name again the

1918.929 --> 1926.01
recent few days I can't remember

1922.1 --> 1928.32
it's what plants do what's it that's it

1926.01 --> 1930.27
yeah photosynthesis these kind of

1928.32 --> 1932.8999999999999
processes and other types of related

1930.27 --> 1937.35
processes like the transformation of

1932.9 --> 1940.38
vitamins that we do we can transform

1937.35 --> 1942.8999999999999
vitamin C into vitamin E I think or was

1940.38 --> 1945.75
it D and we do this naturally by

1942.9 --> 1948.3300000000002
absorbing sunlight on our skin yeah so

1945.75 --> 1951.57
there are all kinds of processes based

1948.33 --> 1954.1789999999999
on the interaction of daylight hating

1951.57 --> 1958.2
matter and that's basically what is

1954.179 --> 1962.7900000000002
creating all this life and yeah how if

1958.2 --> 1966.03
you say that is the Sun well it's the

1962.79 --> 1968.78
daylight that's what's actually tangibly

1966.03 --> 1968.78
doing it

1970.429 --> 1982.3400000000001
huh yeah it is kind of sometimes it's

1978.71 --> 1983.8990000000001
it's kind of confusing because it's it's

1982.34 --> 1987.86
almost like you have to be up in the air

1983.899 --> 1990.7399999999998
you know you can't you can't place your

1987.86 --> 1994.0089999999998
you know checkmark somewhere because you

1990.74 --> 1999.08
really can't verify it unless someone

1994.009 --> 2003.22
has what do you mean well like for

1999.08 --> 2006.57
example like me times and I've been on

2003.22 --> 2009.19
an airplane whenever whenever I go up to

2006.57 --> 2014.799
the cruising altitude whether whatever

2009.19 --> 2016.419
it is 30 30 35 I can't see the stars you

2014.799 --> 2021.279
know and maybe that's just me maybe

2016.419 --> 2023.23
somebody else can and so it's sometimes

2021.279 --> 2026.139
I think maybe these lights in the sky

2023.23 --> 2028.48
are only meant to be seen from Earth so

2026.139 --> 2031.299
I'm wondering if is that energy coming

2028.48 --> 2036.119
from the earth or is it being

2031.299 --> 2036.119
transferred from what we call the sky

2036.69 --> 2041.259
well that may be there may be a little

2039.129 --> 2044.1999999999998
off topic but I was just trying to give

2041.259 --> 2047.23
you an example well it might be that if

2044.2 --> 2051.909
you are literally in too close a

2047.23 --> 2054.28
proximity to the region within the

2051.909 --> 2057.6690000000003
atmosphere where this electrical effect

2054.28 --> 2062.1690000000003
is actually causing all these light

2057.669 --> 2065.109
phenomena then maybe you may be outside

2062.169 --> 2068.02
of the range where it simply is visible

2065.109 --> 2070.659
as it is if it is holographic in nature

2068.02 --> 2074.02
this is logical because many types of

2070.659 --> 2076.9900000000002
generated Holograms can only be properly

2074.02 --> 2079.03
seen from a certain angle and then if

2076.99 --> 2082.24
you move then suddenly it becomes

2079.03 --> 2084.3390000000004
distorted and I think it's kind of the

2082.24 --> 2087.9599999999996
same nature so I think it because of the

2084.339 --> 2091.0299999999997
proximity to the actual atmospheric or

2087.96 --> 2094.109
proto atmospheric layer where these

2091.03 --> 2096.549
energy processes causing the lights are

2094.109 --> 2099.15
happening I think if you get too close

2096.549 --> 2103.36
to it you simply don't see them anymore

2099.15 --> 2107.12
or at least the more subtle ones

2103.36 --> 2108.92
it's like blurr getting too close to an

2107.12 --> 2111.91
image and then your side blurs out

2108.92 --> 2111.91
almost like that

2118.619 --> 2121.5190000000002
what do you think

2123.16 --> 2130.18
peanuts yeah yeah I'm here so basically

2126.569 --> 2133.569
basically you're saying that the

2130.18 --> 2136.93
atmosphere has distorted that light to

2133.569 --> 2139.0
be seen and then as you go up it's less

2136.93 --> 2142.39
atmosphere so it's not distorting it for

2139.0 --> 2144.13
you is that what you're saying no no

2142.39 --> 2146.8289999999997
okay so it's not about the atmospheric

2144.13 --> 2149.289
pressure or anything you mentioned it so

2146.829 --> 2152.4100000000003
I thought that that's what yeah but that

2149.289 --> 2156.2200000000003
proto atmospheric layer it is it is in a

2152.41 --> 2159.64
region presumably it is in a region

2156.22 --> 2161.769
where this electrical activity is taking

2159.64 --> 2164.65
place because if that type of electrical

2161.769 --> 2167.41
activity was taking place on earth then

2164.65 --> 2169.6600000000003
we would absolutely register it and even

2167.41 --> 2173.3689999999997
see the correlations with the patterns

2169.66 --> 2175.8089999999997
of the heavens in my opinion okay

2173.369 --> 2180.25
although yeah maybe they are with the

2175.809 --> 2183.369
moon and the Sun of ID it is so complex

2180.25 --> 2186.099
I said this is very felt out still but

2183.369 --> 2189.509
just very visual to me

2186.099 --> 2198.5
I haven't actually put in all the data

2189.509 --> 2202.4
but yeah

2198.5 --> 2206.03
now I'd I don't think it is caused by

2202.4 --> 2209.359
any type of gas pressure effect I think

2206.03 --> 2212.51
it's just something electrical that just

2209.359 --> 2214.7
happens up there for some reason maybe

2212.51 --> 2223.13
it's a natural part of the design side

2214.7 --> 2227.93
effect right maybe it's all these

2223.13 --> 2230.599
presumed heavy wind layers remember that

2227.93 --> 2235.64
the high jet streams that people

2230.599 --> 2239.42
reference remember that they're supposed

2235.64 --> 2241.3689999999997
to be high layers on the disk model it's

2239.42 --> 2243.23
even been shown like oh yeah see they're

2241.369 --> 2244.9300000000003
up there and this one's going this way

2243.23 --> 2248.9900000000002
and the other ones going the other way

2244.93 --> 2251.4199999999996
well wind does cause static electricity

2248.99 --> 2254.41
as well so maybe even these wind layers

2251.42 --> 2259.01
have some have some kind of influence in

2254.41 --> 2263.089
generating a charge for this effect it's

2259.01 --> 2266.1800000000003
just just speculation though but there's

2263.089 --> 2269.27
all things in my view that could be

2266.18 --> 2273.2599999999998
generating the electrical effects that

2269.27 --> 2277.73
are presumably causing the the optics

2273.26 --> 2279.8590000000004
for the globe of the heavens yeah that's

2277.73 --> 2282.2
interesting I never thought about the

2279.859 --> 2285.83
difference in pressures creating the

2282.2 --> 2289.8489999999997
wind and then also creating a charge I

2285.83 --> 2291.97
never thought about that because it it

2289.849 --> 2295.2200000000003
does make sense that different pressures

2291.97 --> 2298.7599999999998
will create our wind right I mean that's

2295.22 --> 2302.77
that seems feasible right that's why we

2298.76 --> 2308.2700000000004
have wind right well yes but there are

2302.77 --> 2310.49
so so I think at least constant wind

2308.27 --> 2312.23
layers like very high up there certain

2310.49 --> 2315.5299999999997
places where the wind is just constantly

2312.23 --> 2319.19
going in one direction like a perpetual

2315.53 --> 2321.17
river of air just moving and then in

2319.19 --> 2323.66
another height it goes in a different

2321.17 --> 2327.32
direction and I can't explain how that

2323.66 --> 2330.109
works not like normal weather patterns

2327.32 --> 2331.1090000000004
winds which is caused by yeah very

2330.109 --> 2336.93
blatantly

2331.109 --> 2338.94
obvious heat exchange causing Yahoo low

2336.93 --> 2341.7
pressure high pressure situations and

2338.94 --> 2344.039
that displaces it locally but these wind

2341.7 --> 2347.1299999999997
streams that I've heard of seem to be

2344.039 --> 2352.739
constant so it's not caused by the same

2347.13 --> 2355.4990000000003
effect mm-hmm I wonder if that has

2352.739 --> 2358.7690000000002
something to do with you know Kim

2355.499 --> 2365.8489999999997
Charles you know I mean no no absolutely

2358.769 --> 2368.7
not now chemtrails are not gonna cause

2365.849 --> 2370.4100000000003
constant wind streams and besides I

2368.7 --> 2374.009
think the wind streams have been used

2370.41 --> 2376.6189999999997
all throughout the 20th century or at

2374.009 --> 2377.43
least the latter part when they started

2376.619 --> 2379.44
to do

2377.43 --> 2383.999
yeah when when they start to go up

2379.44 --> 2386.099
really high with bigger planes and

2383.999 --> 2388.589
probably like the stealth fighter and

2386.099 --> 2392.2690000000002
all that they also all use that that

2388.589 --> 2392.269
those wind layers I presume

2396.79 --> 2404.89
mm-hmm I know one thing that these are a

2400.44 --> 2407.9500000000003
lot of glow believers they don't like

2404.89 --> 2416.17
this gas pressure argument but they do

2407.95 --> 2419.02
not like it it's it's always they always

2416.17 --> 2421.03
come back to like the layers kind of how

2419.02 --> 2425.65
you are describing the layers of the jet

2421.03 --> 2429.01
stream and the denser gases denser gases

2425.65 --> 2434.14
are stacking up on each other creating

2429.01 --> 2436.21
almost like a container and that's

2434.14 --> 2442.0899999999997
that's the only way of kind of seeing

2436.21 --> 2444.52
somebody try to answer it well they're

2442.09 --> 2447.4300000000003
just simply not taking into account the

2444.52 --> 2448.81
awesome power of gas pressure trying to

2447.43 --> 2452.5299999999997
find its equilibrium within the

2448.81 --> 2455.83
container they just don't think about it

2452.53 --> 2458.0800000000004
ever and it just like that doesn't exist

2455.83 --> 2460.42
really it's just the gravity slowly

2458.08 --> 2461.98
pushing and yeah the gas is not gonna go

2460.42 --> 2465.4
anywhere because we're going to ignore

2461.98 --> 2468.28
that it has the effect of entropy so

2465.4 --> 2469.6600000000003
yeah then you're just a slight push is

2468.28 --> 2471.1600000000003
enough to keep the gas on the earth

2469.66 --> 2474.25
that's their line of reasoning

2471.16 --> 2479.41
it's literally fueled by blatant

2474.25 --> 2483.37
ignorance was very sad well it's also

2479.41 --> 2486.22
kind of made me really want to not

2483.37 --> 2489.46
redefine but really kind of because a

2486.22 --> 2492.49
lot of times you'll hear someone say you

2489.46 --> 2494.34
know in space it doesn't suck right you

2492.49 --> 2501.1299999999997
can't have you can't have negative

2494.34 --> 2503.53
pressure so I'm almost thinking you know

2501.13 --> 2508.27
when does it become a vacuum when when

2503.53 --> 2511.36
does pressure become a vacuum and so

2508.27 --> 2514.9
basically what we're told that what 65

2511.36 --> 2517.9300000000003
miles 66 miles is the corman line no but

2514.9 --> 2521.23
listen just the vacuum of space is just

2517.93 --> 2523.02
a common tongue vernacular because if

2521.23 --> 2526.39
you start a scrumpet and all these

2523.02 --> 2528.79
ballers people that are a little bit

2526.39 --> 2530.0299999999997
more studied AWOL as your vacuum is just

2528.79 --> 2531.5299999999997
a concept and

2530.03 --> 2535.61
sexually just really really really

2531.53 --> 2538.5800000000004
really low pressure so that's a bit of

2535.61 --> 2541.34
an old argument but yet they will

2538.58 --> 2544.43
imagine that that pressure will go that

2541.34 --> 2546.77
incredibly low as NASA has foretold it

2544.43 --> 2550.79
and there's no evidence of that there's

2546.77 --> 2554.5
actually much more evidence that if you

2550.79 --> 2559.7
studied in the layout of the gradient

2554.5 --> 2562.22
that the pressure has a 1/2 distance in

2559.7 --> 2564.1699999999996
the sense that at low down the earth

2562.22 --> 2566.74
pressures relatively high if you go up

2564.17 --> 2569.9300000000003
just a little higher the pressure you're

2566.74 --> 2572.4199999999996
dramatically decreases and then a little

2569.93 --> 2575.93
bit higher it's much less dramatically

2572.42 --> 2581.21
decreasing and that's actually going

2575.93 --> 2583.3999999999996
down to a flatline type of half distance

2581.21 --> 2585.65
that's why it's not a half life it's a

2583.4 --> 2589.76
half distance so that means that the

2585.65 --> 2593.06
farther the distance the longer it takes

2589.76 --> 2594.9500000000003
for the pressure to half for example

2593.06 --> 2597.98
that yeah that's the most conceptual way

2594.95 --> 2602.0899999999997
to explain it so at a huge distance yeah

2597.98 --> 2604.19
it's gonna be low pressure but not not

2602.09 --> 2608.9300000000003
so close to a vacuum at all

2604.19 --> 2611.33
and if you extrapolate the result the

2608.93 --> 2612.98
consequences of that gradient then you

2611.33 --> 2616.22
would have to conclude that the universe

2612.98 --> 2620.23
is pretty much filled with very low gas

2616.22 --> 2624.9399999999996
pressure because the exponential factor

2620.23 --> 2627.98
is gonna just keep on growing

2624.94 --> 2631.37
technically forever and then you can

2627.98 --> 2634.04
presume that other bodies like the Sun

2631.37 --> 2636.04
and the moon and other planets and their

2634.04 --> 2638.39
atmosphere have their own gradient

2636.04 --> 2640.82
interacting with the exponential

2638.39 --> 2642.5299999999997
gradient of the earth atmosphere and

2640.82 --> 2647.3900000000003
yeah you would have like a kind of a

2642.53 --> 2649.9700000000003
gaseous outer space with yeah gradient

2647.39 --> 2653.71
fluctuations and very low pressure zones

2649.97 --> 2657.4399999999996
and relatively high pressure zones

2653.71 --> 2659.83
that's what you get well if you would be

2657.44 --> 2659.83
honest

2660.92 --> 2667.7400000000002
there is a rarely be any real vacuums

2663.99 --> 2670.769
except like in the these supposed void

2667.74 --> 2672.839
in between galaxies that is where the

2670.769 --> 2674.8489999999997
more real vacuum would be in that case

2672.839 --> 2682.38
but in a galaxy there wouldn't be much

2674.849 --> 2687.029
vacuum so many yeah anyway it's the

2682.38 --> 2690.75
outer glass universe right we were

2687.029 --> 2696.349
listening to a it was a it was a child

2690.75 --> 2699.42
he was probably 13 maybe 14 and his

2696.349 --> 2706.17
school they they took him to a field

2699.42 --> 2707.609
trip at the Florida Kennedy Space of the

2706.17 --> 2710.819
NASA one of the NASA

2707.609 --> 2714.5989999999997
I think he's called Kennedy Space Center

2710.819 --> 2720.0
I could be wrong on that but basically

2714.599 --> 2724.98
they took a field trip to it's basically

2720.0 --> 2728.309
like a tour basically and they get to

2724.98 --> 2731.22
come in and they get to talk to an

2728.309 --> 2737.059
astronaut and they gets us astronaut

2731.22 --> 2740.8799999999997
questions right and so one of the I

2737.059 --> 2745.3190000000004
forget his name but one of the kids

2740.88 --> 2747.75
there had been looking into Flat Earth

2745.319 --> 2752.19
and one thing that he really picked up

2747.75 --> 2755.369
on was the laws of thermodynamics the

2752.19 --> 2759.48
1st 2nd and 3rd law but he really

2755.369 --> 2761.039
remembered the second one and he said

2759.48 --> 2764.21
that he was really nervous you know cuz

2761.039 --> 2769.9500000000003
he didn't want to just come out and be

2764.21 --> 2772.7
like like a clown or whatever you know

2769.95 --> 2775.1699999999996
but so once he said once he got to the

2772.7 --> 2780.569
part 2 where they get to sit down with

2775.17 --> 2783.329
an astronaut and astronaut questions he

2780.569 --> 2786.2889999999998
basically asks the question of second

2783.329 --> 2792.3700000000003
law of their own general thermodynamics

2786.289 --> 2796.84
and basically the the astronaut left or

2792.37 --> 2798.6099999999997
and district order this question and so

2796.84 --> 2801.1000000000004
he said later on they got to another

2798.61 --> 2804.94
part to where they got to talk to a

2801.1 --> 2807.36
another astronaut and the Astra he

2804.94 --> 2813.4900000000002
ignored his second law of thermodynamics

2807.36 --> 2815.44
question yes yeah and so they got he

2813.49 --> 2820.06
said he got to another part to where he

2815.44 --> 2826.06
got to ask it again and so we asked it

2820.06 --> 2830.08
again and again the astronaut avoided

2826.06 --> 2832.0299999999997
his question and finally someone that

2830.08 --> 2836.2599999999998
was working there went to his physics

2832.03 --> 2839.86
teacher and his physics teacher brought

2836.26 --> 2841.92
this kid to the side and his that his

2839.86 --> 2844.7200000000003
teacher asked him you know are you

2841.92 --> 2848.2000000000003
making fun of them about Flat Earth and

2844.72 --> 2851.3799999999997
this kid said nothing about Flat Earth

2848.2 --> 2855.97
all he asked was about the law of

2851.38 --> 2858.96
thermodynamics and he said that they

2855.97 --> 2863.0099999999998
they removed him from the field trip and

2858.96 --> 2866.71
they took him out they took him out

2863.01 --> 2868.3900000000003
segregated him from the other kids so he

2866.71 --> 2870.07
wasn't allowed to go back in there I

2868.39 --> 2872.8599999999997
just thought that was there was a lot

2870.07 --> 2875.6800000000003
more details to the interviewed but when

2872.86 --> 2880.09
I was to sum it up yeah yeah he was

2875.68 --> 2883.8999999999996
being a disruption to the dream yep

2880.09 --> 2887.44
here he also mentioned that while he was

2883.9 --> 2890.44
there going through the little tour he

2887.44 --> 2894.09
said that they had posters on the walls

2890.44 --> 2897.9700000000003
making fun of flattered oh my god really

2894.09 --> 2900.9100000000003
they have he said they had pictures of

2897.97 --> 2903.8799999999997
the little squares and they have the

2900.91 --> 2910.12
little boat falling off of course the

2903.88 --> 2913.06
edge the infinite add your argument cost

2910.12 --> 2918.96
I presume it must be a flat disk in

2913.06 --> 2918.96
space I just thought it was very telling

2919.619 --> 2925.859
because the kids said nothing about

2922.559 --> 2928.079
flutter nothing and when his teacher

2925.859 --> 2930.239
came and asked them you know they like

2928.079 --> 2933.259
are you are you you know joking about

2930.239 --> 2936.42
flatter to these guys or something I

2933.259 --> 2940.94
still don't see any question did he

2936.42 --> 2944.219
respond no this is his science questions

2940.94 --> 2946.2290000000003
yeah but he he said he got really

2944.219 --> 2950.16
nervous you know so he just kind of how

2946.229 --> 2951.7189999999996
old was good like I said he was it was a

2950.16 --> 2956.759
school field trip so he still gotta be

2951.719 --> 2957.809
in it school you know maybe 13 14 right

2956.759 --> 2959.5190000000002
right right

2957.809 --> 2964.529
so I mean he got nervous higher yeah

2959.519 --> 2968.519
yeah good I just thought it was really

2964.529 --> 2973.38
telling you know yeah he also said that

2968.519 --> 2977.0989999999997
uh the the astronaut that he got to ask

2973.38 --> 2979.739
questions to when he got home he tried

2977.099 --> 2983.2490000000003
to find this astronaut and NASA has this

2979.739 --> 2985.2
guy know were listed on their website so

2983.249 --> 2989.6899999999996
whoever that was was just pretending to

2985.2 --> 2996.7189999999996
be someone who went to space obviously

2989.69 --> 3000.049
yep but it just shows the it shows the

2996.719 --> 3006.89
amount of laws that they're willing to

3000.049 --> 3007.88
go to just to keep this a fantasy right

3006.89 --> 3010.339
right

3007.88 --> 3015.469
well it's fantasies are kind of delicate

3010.339 --> 3017.029
so I'm not surprised like to be honest

3015.469 --> 3019.819
and now I'm gonna play devil's advocate

3017.029 --> 3023.509
for a moment and that is that if I was

3019.819 --> 3029.719
them I would put a lot more effort into

3023.509 --> 3032.9
it and well maybe they are maybe they

3029.719 --> 3035.599
are have been working on a real

3032.9 --> 3038.42
elaborate response plan an in-depth

3035.599 --> 3040.1600000000003
response plan to this movement for five

3038.42 --> 3045.44
years and they're still working on it

3040.16 --> 3048.319
you know that all the the most relevant

3045.44 --> 3050.68
responses may not be the first responses

3048.319 --> 3053.45
we have to realize this as a movement

3050.68 --> 3056.54
they may be building up to something and

3053.45 --> 3058.79
then just suddenly overwhelm us with all

3056.54 --> 3061.0099999999998
the answers that are really good that

3058.79 --> 3063.619
might turn out to be really incredible

3061.01 --> 3066.1090000000004
and they just withhold it to us just

3063.619 --> 3068.6600000000003
throw it at us all at once you don't

3066.109 --> 3071.63
know they have freaking supercomputers

3068.66 --> 3074.5989999999997
they have incredible technology

3071.63 --> 3077.78
available to them so we don't know what

3074.599 --> 3080.48
yeah to assume that we've won because we

3077.78 --> 3083.299
are winning it's not a guarantee

3080.48 --> 3085.609
they made bring in totally new angles

3083.299 --> 3087.2
that yeah none of us have even thought

3085.609 --> 3090.17
about before and we are just getting

3087.2 --> 3092.72
used to being the winners and that makes

3090.17 --> 3097.64
us actually vulnerable for when things

3092.72 --> 3098.109
suddenly switch around so that's a good

3097.64 --> 3102.98
point

3098.109 --> 3105.5589999999997
that's it like like don't get so don't

3102.98 --> 3110.42
get too confident yeah yeah that's a

3105.559 --> 3113.1800000000003
good point right and keep keep growing

3110.42 --> 3115.01
the skills look this period with all

3113.18 --> 3120.04
these ballers is very useful to us

3115.01 --> 3123.7700000000004
because it kind of is free training in

3120.04 --> 3127.13
resisting psychological warfare and that

3123.77 --> 3130.46
training is also very much intuitive and

3127.13 --> 3134.7200000000003
it will help you beyond just science

3130.46 --> 3137.54
debates or dealing with Globus it will

3134.72 --> 3140.0299999999997
give you a whole new angle of

3137.54 --> 3144.589
observation for you as a person to deal

3140.03 --> 3148.0690000000004
with things and people and may help us a

3144.589 --> 3151.91
great deal for what might just pop up at

3148.069 --> 3154.96
at some point you need to keep going

3151.91 --> 3158.96
don't get too confident don't be sloppy

3154.96 --> 3161.089
take it serious and grow your skill and

3158.96 --> 3165.17
keep on learning keep on learning how to

3161.089 --> 3168.77
deal with this religion in a

3165.17 --> 3171.619
constructive way and not well yeah not

3168.77 --> 3174.38
just shaming it can you can you put a

3171.619 --> 3178.339
different word there thing my vision why

3174.38 --> 3179.3900000000003
the ballers the globe religion it is a

3178.339 --> 3181.92
religion

3179.39 --> 3183.749
okay I thought you were defining I

3181.92 --> 3187.6800000000003
thought you were defining something else

3183.749 --> 3189.5389999999998
yeah okay I'm not defining Flat Earth as

3187.68 --> 3196.339
a religion okay okay

3189.539 --> 3200.329
it's more like a a movement a movement

3196.339 --> 3202.709
based on a natural awakening process

3200.329 --> 3208.289
guided by the possibilities of the

3202.709 --> 3211.3799999999997
Internet and social media well that's

3208.289 --> 3214.44
good oh well if if anyone out there is

3211.38 --> 3218.1600000000003
listening and if they want to hear the

3214.44 --> 3222.089
whole interview with all the details the

3218.16 --> 3225.66
channel name is Helios skeptic oh yeah I

3222.089 --> 3230.16
know and uh they hear all the interview

3225.66 --> 3232.44
is on there and the child gives a lot

3230.16 --> 3234.529
more details I'm just kind of summed it

3232.44 --> 3237.839
up all right

3234.529 --> 3242.91
I'll uh I'll try to find it and put it

3237.839 --> 3246.8089999999997
out in chat yeah he he gave everyone

3242.91 --> 3248.8489999999997
permission to mirror it or use it nah I

3246.809 --> 3252.2690000000002
don't I don't

3248.849 --> 3254.969
mirrors stuff really offer only when

3252.269 --> 3257.43
it's really super super relevant to

3254.969 --> 3259.38
something that I'm working with because

3257.43 --> 3261.719
yeah if you start mirroring then you

3259.38 --> 3264.119
just become a mirror channel and I was

3261.719 --> 3270.799
most of my content to be absolutely

3264.119 --> 3276.239
unique um right so when when was this

3270.799 --> 3279.329
was it the flat earth discord life and

3276.239 --> 3283.7690000000002
he was yeah he's a skeptic yeah it was

3279.329 --> 3286.789
on there this was when one day you go

3283.769 --> 3292.859
four days of those five so Saturday

3292.859 --> 3302.42
days ago right holy crap it was almost

3296.67 --> 3302.42
12 hours that's insane

3304.07 --> 3309.05
12 hour video I didn't even know that

3306.69 --> 3309.05
was possible

3309.59 --> 3314.07
somewhere on the channel I'll have to

3311.82 --> 3316.98
find it he he was supposed to tick just

3314.07 --> 3321.23
that just a clip of the interview and

3316.98 --> 3325.05
make it a separate video how loss is it

3321.23 --> 3331.59
the interview itself was it roughly 2

3325.05 --> 3332.79
minutes and 44 seconds oh all right I

3387.27 --> 3393.72
lot I'm trying to find the timestamp we

3391.31 --> 3401.85

down because my financial situation is

3417.11 --> 3421.55
yeah the juice is running out I can't

3420.48 --> 3424.7400000000002
say it any other way

3421.55 --> 3429.26
yeah all of you have been very generous

3424.74 --> 3434.7299999999996
especially when I started up but yeah

3429.26 --> 3437.55
I'll hold in there but you have to cut

3434.73 --> 3441.93
it down a bit with the luxuries and just

3437.55 --> 3444.9300000000003
try to stabilize financially again ah

3441.93 --> 3446.43
that always helps Thank You Billy was

3444.93 --> 3447.6499999999996
that for the two pound super jet

3446.43 --> 3453.1499999999996
donation

3447.65 --> 3458.73
although yeah yeah I don't know I still

3453.15 --> 3461.82
only got one one cash out from YouTube

3458.73 --> 3464.22
so far and it was big well I thought it

3461.82 --> 3465.7200000000003
was big anyway but yeah after that I

3464.22 --> 3467.79
haven't seen anything I don't know how

3465.72 --> 3469.56
long it takes do they pay out in like

3467.79 --> 3472.05
every three months or something I don't

3469.56 --> 3474.15
know or they just standard three months

3472.05 --> 3475.9700000000003
late and then they play every month I

3474.15 --> 3480.1800000000003
don't know what it's going to be but I

3475.97 --> 3482.52
don't know I'll see but yeah any super

3480.18 --> 3485.3399999999997
Chad donations and especially PayPal

3482.52 --> 3493.83
donations are very welcome and I could

3485.34 --> 3497.1000000000004
really use that to help my situation but

3493.83 --> 3501.42
but I'll manage like I still have my

3497.1 --> 3504.15
backup sources I just don't like

3501.42 --> 3505.98
money just to get by but it happens it

3504.15 --> 3510.77
said been happening a lot in the last

3505.98 --> 3519.119
four or five years uh it's just

3510.77 --> 3524.16
consequence being poor paypal takes a

3519.119 --> 3525.78
lot less yeah it takes nothing nothing

3524.16 --> 3528.18
they take don't know they take something

3525.78 --> 3532.2900000000004
they take something after certain

3528.18 --> 3534.5989999999997
amounts oh but that's pretty high so now

3532.29 --> 3539.7599999999998
every time I see that's just zero they

3534.599 --> 3542.4
just don't ask anything yeah that's good

3539.76 --> 3545.94
and it's like immediately if somebody

3542.4 --> 3548.4900000000002
PayPal's me I see it I can transfer it

3545.94 --> 3551.25
to my bank account and it's gonna be

3548.49 --> 3553.68
there within 24 hours pretty much every

3551.25 --> 3559.53
time unless it's Sunday then it takes a

3553.68 --> 3561.39
little longer but but yeah and that's

3559.53 --> 3563.94
helped me out a great deal I've had

3561.39 --> 3567.21
quite a few paypal donations like

3563.94 --> 3570.51
especially last month and that really

3567.21 --> 3577.559
saved my eyes big-time and yeah enabled

3570.51 --> 3578.579
me to of course get the microphone yeah

3577.559 --> 3582.5690000000004
it was good

3578.579 --> 3585.1800000000003
was very good it was a great relief but

3582.569 --> 3589.619
anymore I don't like I don't like saying

3585.18 --> 3592.3799999999997
it but it is true and I don't know it

3589.619 --> 3594.7200000000003
comes and goes in waves and yeah you

3592.38 --> 3597.359
can't just I don't want to be like a

3594.72 --> 3599.2799999999997
freaking Church saying like every time

3597.359 --> 3605.0099999999998
you come you have to put something in

3599.28 --> 3608.73
the basket but yeah man I do admit that

3605.01 --> 3613.4100000000003
I kinda do need it but yeah you know

3608.73 --> 3618.15
can't force it I totally understand why

3613.41 --> 3623.819
because it's just a shitty part about

3618.15 --> 3626.069
being poor and look it's not like I'm

3623.819 --> 3627.869
not even considering a job or anything

3626.069 --> 3631.14
like I'm really trying to figure out

3627.869 --> 3633.96
like how can I get through this in a way

3631.14 --> 3636.33
that I'm gonna survive that flat earth

3633.96 --> 3640.98
and this show might be able to survive

3636.33 --> 3643.38
somehow and the same time you had the my

3640.98 --> 3646.92
financial backup plan as I keep calling

3643.38 --> 3650.73
it is still getting into its final

3646.92 --> 3653.01
stages for me so technically I would

3650.73 --> 3656.07
only roughly need it a year unless like

3653.01 --> 3658.1090000000004
something terrible happened that would

3656.07 --> 3660.78
cost me huge amount of money then I'd be

3658.109 --> 3663.5099999999998
screwed again but I'm presuming it's not

3660.78 --> 3665.9700000000003
gonna happen because every time did

3663.51 --> 3668.3100000000004
happen so far I now know why that [Â __Â ]

3665.97 --> 3669.47
happens and I'm not gonna let it happen

3668.31 --> 3672.06
anymore

3669.47 --> 3676.1699999999996
so yeah and they're going to the doctor

3672.06 --> 3680.15
again let me tell you but yeah until

3676.17 --> 3683.76
that time I I'm still kind of juggling

3680.15 --> 3687.5
with the reserves but I'll I'll live

3683.76 --> 3690.96
through it anyway enough enough begging

3687.5 --> 3693.869
I'm not bore I basically got a new set

3690.96 --> 3696.7200000000003
of clothes so I'm just like doing much

3693.869 --> 3702.27
much better than I was doing at the end

3696.72 --> 3705.8689999999997
of last year so about that but to head

3702.27 --> 3710.04
out for work but I wanted to ask you one

3705.869 --> 3714.33
question before I go and just kind of

3710.04 --> 3718.95
kind of make the answer quick hmm on

3714.33 --> 3723.5989999999997
Saturday you you had a given Marilla on

3718.95 --> 3727.71
your panel and Merle stated that the

3723.599 --> 3730.619
globe was a concept and you told Merle

3727.71 --> 3734.099
that it's not a concept and you told him

3730.619 --> 3735.69
that you cannot get rid of a concept can

3734.099 --> 3741.869
you just kind of explain why he told him

3735.69 --> 3745.32
that all right well it's a concept very

3741.869 --> 3747.48
much like an idea and ideas are

3745.32 --> 3750.57
bulletproof because they are outside of

3747.48 --> 3755.79
the physical you can as long as it's a

3750.57 --> 3759.57
concept then there's always ways to find

3755.79 --> 3763.29
some reason to keep the concept of life

3759.57 --> 3764.3500000000004
that's what the globe is are doing but

3763.29 --> 3769.06
yeah

3764.35 --> 3774.25
I don't know maybe I'm not too sure

3769.06 --> 3776.14
about like the value of what I was

3774.25 --> 3779.46
saying back then maybe I was getting a

3776.14 --> 3782.49
little bit too meta about it but yeah I

3779.46 --> 3786.19
was just thinking like yeah as a concept

3782.49 --> 3788.41
you can just leave it and then work with

3786.19 --> 3797.92
whatever you're gonna find to adapt it

3788.41 --> 3799.99
to that belief somehow and cuz any kind

3797.92 --> 3805.21
of way I do the same thing with my

3799.99 --> 3808.81
rectangular looping earth okay there's

3805.21 --> 3810.7
things though I am NOT the funny thing

3808.81 --> 3812.74
the difference the big difference in my

3810.7 --> 3815.62
view about it about the rectangular

3812.74 --> 3817.5699999999997
looping earth and the globe earth though

3815.62 --> 3820.99
is that the globe earth is all very

3817.57 --> 3824.05
uniform but there are so many sloppy

3820.99 --> 3826.3599999999997
ends that don't work out it's basically

3824.05 --> 3828.76
a model really riddled with holes

3826.36 --> 3831.7000000000003
problem with my model though is it rests

3828.76 --> 3834.48
on some really bizarre conceptual

3831.7 --> 3839.8599999999997
presuppositions the looping factor and

3834.48 --> 3842.38
nonlocality of lights and that makes it

3839.86 --> 3846.04
much more difficult to understand and it

3842.38 --> 3847.75
makes it so real and thus from a more

3846.04 --> 3850.81
personal perspective with many people

3847.75 --> 3853.18
not so yeah they'll not be so eager to

3850.81 --> 3857.77
to latch on to it because it is so so

3853.18 --> 3860.83
real but it does not really have so much

3857.77 --> 3863.2
holes in the model concept with the

3860.83 --> 3865.0299999999997
weird elements which can could

3863.2 --> 3867.5699999999997
technically be proven that's the

3865.03 --> 3871.42
interesting thing yeah

3867.57 --> 3873.25
so I think as a model for whatever

3871.42 --> 3875.02
failures are going to give a model I

3873.25 --> 3878.8
think it's a much better model than the

3875.02 --> 3884.56
globe model because it doesn't have any

3878.8 --> 3889.51
broken net concepts in it gotcha I guess

3884.56 --> 3893.2
just like as I was looking in the floor

3889.51 --> 3894.829
earthly a heliocentric model slowly

3893.2 --> 3902.479
started to vanish

3894.829 --> 3906.469
for me and now it's like I don't I don't

3902.479 --> 3913.009
I don't base any of my ideas on back on

3906.469 --> 3917.569
that model like I used to it's I can do

3913.009 --> 3919.969
it but not by my own volition so much

3917.569 --> 3922.069
it's more like you hear a Glover talk

3919.969 --> 3925.309
about it and then I totally get into it

3922.069 --> 3929.859
again can ride along that just like I

3925.309 --> 3932.179
used to when I still did believe it but

3929.859 --> 3933.89
yeah you have to have a globe or press

3932.179 --> 3936.049
and that starts that line of thinking

3933.89 --> 3939.019
and then it's very easy to get into it

3936.049 --> 3940.88
for me but by myself yeah it's much

3939.019 --> 3942.6789999999996
tougher because I'm just not thinking

3940.88 --> 3945.609
about that type of thing anymore

3942.679 --> 3947.839
because I'm not taking it so seriously I

3945.609 --> 3951.38
take it as a concept and as a

3947.839 --> 3954.679
mathematical construct and that doesn't

3951.38 --> 3956.4790000000003
have so much weight to it or literally

3954.679 --> 3964.369
no weight at all since it is all in

3956.479 --> 3968.5989999999997
material well thank you and yeah thanks

3964.369 --> 3971.779
for coming man yeah enjoy your enjoy

3968.599 --> 3978.8590000000004
your Monday man yeah you hate Monday

3971.779 --> 3981.469
yeah you do yeah you're a working man so

3978.859 --> 3983.569
yeah I can imagine it's always working

3981.469 --> 3990.7690000000002
for working life mondays are annoying

3983.569 --> 3994.7889999999998
yes to start up again yeah I wish I can

3990.769 --> 3999.819
just stay at home and or go outside and

3994.789 --> 4007.63
learn not be occupied by my occupation

3999.819 --> 4010.2889999999998
all right thank you all you're welcome I

4007.63 --> 4013.799
think you're joining the show and yeah

4010.289 --> 4017.3190000000004
you know once you get it in it again

4013.799 --> 4019.569
there must be some satisfaction that can

4017.319 --> 4023.14
be found in the work itself you just

4019.569 --> 4025.959
have to get into that again right it's

4023.14 --> 4028.959
basically trying to displace where your

4025.959 --> 4031.089
source of joy comes from what you choose

4028.959 --> 4032.799
as your source of joy and in the

4031.089 --> 4035.0789999999997
weekends it's like I got all the time in

4032.799 --> 4038.859
the world I can focus on my family or

4035.079 --> 4040.4790000000003
things I really like personally and then

4038.859 --> 4043.779
during your work you just have to remind

4040.479 --> 4045.1299999999997
yourself to stop focusing on liking

4043.779 --> 4046.779
those other things that are not

4045.13 --> 4048.549
available to you anymore and just start

4046.779 --> 4052.63
to see like oh yeah what did I actually

4048.549 --> 4057.549
like about this job yeah that's what I

4052.63 --> 4061.6600000000003
would try maybe it helps please man

4057.549 --> 4066.549
peace your check all right hey see you

4061.66 --> 4073.359
later murder my peanuts yeah that was

4066.549 --> 4075.759
cool ah yeah I can imagine for an itch

4073.359 --> 4081.279
he's probably a little bit jealous of

4075.759 --> 4085.239
the freedom of time sort of freedom of

4081.279 --> 4088.289
time that I do have and yeah there's not

4085.239 --> 4091.689
a lot of people that live like I do I

4088.289 --> 4097.119000000001
definitely understand that so I try not

4091.689 --> 4099.67
to brag with it and always emphasize

4097.119 --> 4101.92
like yeah you have a lot of time but

4099.67 --> 4104.71
there's not a lot of maneuverability

4101.92 --> 4107.139
capacity you like yeah the three things

4104.71 --> 4110.559
in life you can for all the time in the

4107.139 --> 4112.150000000001
world to enjoy them but the not so three

4110.559 --> 4114.909000000001
things they become a problem

4112.15 --> 4117.0689999999995
and they never really become that big a

4114.909 --> 4119.1089999999995
problem when you don't have a lot of

4117.069 --> 4123.25
time but you have a job and much more

4119.109 --> 4129.0
money and more financial flexibility so

4123.25 --> 4129.0
yeah you take one the other one goes

4134.319 --> 4142.63
hmm what Nathan you want to go on sure

4140.21 --> 4142.63
why not

4146.779 --> 4154.569
all right people are asking for links

4149.24 --> 4154.5689999999995
here okay I'll go get it

4182.189 --> 4196.789000000001
and oh god I have so many sky jets so

4190.38 --> 4200.519
big like I really have to scroll now and

4196.789 --> 4202.438999999999
that's not just nonsense rooms I usually

4200.519 --> 4205.860000000001
get out of them or throw them away it's

4202.439 --> 4211.219
just so many people now and relevant

4205.86 --> 4215.098999999999
rooms anyway I put out the link there so

4211.219 --> 4217.499
yeah you're welcome to join it's been

4215.099 --> 4219.84
going going for an hour but since Nathan

4217.499 --> 4222.688999999999
said that he's not gonna have a life

4219.84 --> 4230.369000000001
debate due to technical issues yeah sure

4222.689 --> 4232.849
I will I'll provide the platform no

4230.369 --> 4232.848999999999
problem

4240.98 --> 4246.589999999999
maybe I'm just gonna put out the hangout

4242.9 --> 4253.75
link just right in the chat as well make

4246.59 --> 4253.75
it even more easy and there you go

4262.21 --> 4265.44
see you later Voynich

4280.03 --> 4287.92
hmm yeah glass sure yep weird thing is

4284.88 --> 4290.2
you have less stress on you but that

4287.92 --> 4294.25
doesn't mean that you will not be

4290.2 --> 4296.41
stressed because the same time if you

4294.25 --> 4299.86
have a lock you have to do all the time

4296.41 --> 4302.46
and physical work that actually relieves

4299.86 --> 4308.4
a certain natural stress that builds up

4302.46 --> 4311.71
AJ dreamers a nice of you to pop by I

4308.4 --> 4314.349999999999
have no thoughts on the plasma Cataclysm

4311.71 --> 4316.09
theory but there may have been some kind

4314.35 --> 4318.1
of electrical storms that certainly

4316.09 --> 4320.32
seemed to be physical remnants of this

4318.1 --> 4323.08
and I think it was probably during the

4320.32 --> 4325.599999999999
Atlantean Age that this happened that's

4323.08 --> 4329.62
about it if that was what were you were

4325.6 --> 4333.1
referring to but again back to the other

4329.62 --> 4337.54
question being less stressed yeah if you

4333.1 --> 4340.75
work if you have like real purpose a

4337.54 --> 4344.73
drive then that relieves a lot of stress

4340.75 --> 4350.37
or like anxiety stress and when you're

4344.73 --> 4353.83
not working really big time then that

4350.37 --> 4355.54
anxiety doesn't get removed from the

4353.83 --> 4358.03
work and it starts to build up and you

4355.54 --> 4360.55
can get a bit stressed out over time and

4358.03 --> 4363.91
that is also varied it's almost as

4360.55 --> 4365.9800000000005
difficult to deal with that when you're

4363.91 --> 4368.23
not a regular worker as it is dealing

4365.98 --> 4370.75
with work stress as you are a regular

4368.23 --> 4373.66
worker although in these days with jobs

4370.75 --> 4376.69
and how crazy they can get the job

4373.66 --> 4380.349999999999
stress can be a lot worse even so but it

4376.69 --> 4384.099999999999
is it is something that people overlook

4380.35 --> 4385.900000000001
a lot not having a job it's very

4384.1 --> 4391.030000000001
stressful for people especially people

4385.9 --> 4392.469999999999
used to working very stressful and I am

4391.03 --> 4395.82
NOT one of these people I have never

4392.47 --> 4398.8
really got used to work I am a total

4395.82 --> 4401.349999999999
toss our society over recheck when it

4398.8 --> 4404.14
comes to that anyway thank you James

4401.35 --> 4406.63
Mays for the ten dollar super chat

4404.14 --> 4411.17
donation very much appreciated and I

4406.63 --> 4415.08
think we got a guest see you lose it

4411.17 --> 4420.54
soundly yeah boy

4415.08 --> 4423.93
how you doing right that's not decently

4420.54 --> 4426.21
but hello sounds knots only and that's

4423.93 --> 4429.4800000000005
healthy fortunately does the cameraman

4426.21 --> 4434.01
Phelan Riley last night God Riley lied

4429.48 --> 4436.11
again to me what do you think I have no

4434.01 --> 4438.27
idea what you're talking about yeah he

4436.11 --> 4439.92
said he was taking the video from Haley

4438.27 --> 4441.870000000001
he took these videos and pictures from

4439.92 --> 4444.51
Hoylake of their Blackpool Tower so he

4441.87 --> 4446.099999999999
claimed but it wasn't he was way down

4444.51 --> 4448.83
the course then he was proved to be a

4446.1 --> 4450.9890000000005
lie of time and time again what do you

4448.83 --> 4453.8099999999995
think that comment I think I think

4450.989 --> 4455.73
that's probably slander and just mixing

4453.81 --> 4456.780000000001
no no no no no something went into

4455.73 --> 4458.969999999999
called the pictures and they've been

4456.78 --> 4466.11
verified not one of the pictures was

4458.97 --> 4469.17
where ever I Lee said he was not one ie

4466.11 --> 4471.719999999999
I know once these pictures was where

4469.17 --> 4473.85
Riley said well it's just hair say to me

4471.72 --> 4477.09
at this point no no it's not it is

4473.85 --> 4480.06
hearsay to me it is to me yeah it is

4477.09 --> 4482.28
it is to me hearsay don't tell me what

4480.06 --> 4484.8
it is and what it is not to me I said

4482.28 --> 4486.929999999999
just hearsay three listen oh yeah

4484.8 --> 4488.31
unemployed trick listen what you do is

4486.93 --> 4489.84
you drag your after and you look at

4488.31 --> 4491.7300000000005
these videos you see where he's lying

4489.84 --> 4496.1900000000005
then you bring up with them yeah if your

4491.73 --> 4500.719999999999
truth are I don't you piss off [Â __Â ]

4496.19 --> 4500.719999999999

little bit of time to just talk but yeah

4550.74 --> 4555.09
I am ready like since Nathan pretty much

4553.68 --> 4557.610000000001
announced that there wasn't gonna be a

4555.09 --> 4560.55
debates today due to technical issues I

4557.61 --> 4562.83
have no problem just throwing the link

4560.55 --> 4565.92
out there as I am doing again right now

4562.83 --> 4567.54
so anyone who's welcome except that guy

4565.92 --> 4574.62

you moving is there any specific reason

4656.03 --> 4662.07
well

4658.73 --> 4666.48
it's actually in part due to you

4662.07 --> 4672.299999999999
actually um yeah when I first joined you

4666.48 --> 4676.5599999999995

4693.659 --> 4699.839999999999
was dealing with then more importantly

4694.92 --> 4704.4
what I had to face and I took on both

4699.84 --> 4706.4400000000005
what you said and I went I went down and

4704.4 --> 4708.089999999999
I you know I face the music I face all

4706.44 --> 4712.049999999999
the ridicule the judgments all the rest

4708.09 --> 4715.05
of it and I was able to get some of my

4712.05 --> 4718.13
inheritance that was held back and I've

4715.05 --> 4723.860000000001
purchased a house in Christchurch in

4718.13 --> 4727.79
Christchurch yeah well okay I actually

4723.86 --> 4732.119
won the auction the day of the whole

4727.79 --> 4734.13
shooting think serious yeah like it was

4732.119 --> 4736.65
my auction was at one o'clock finished

4734.13 --> 4740.01
around quarter past one and then half an

4736.65 --> 4745.348999999999
hour later all that went down so Wow and

4740.01 --> 4746.88
he's bizarre yeah I remember touching on

4745.349 --> 4749.849
a briefly last time when I was a bit

4746.88 --> 4753.09
more emotional about all those things

4749.849 --> 4754.469
but I've had to kind of just focus on

4753.09 --> 4757.77
what's going on but yeah I just want to

4754.469 --> 4761.07
say thank you for your guidance and what

4757.77 --> 4765.63
you said to me because it was you know

4761.07 --> 4770.549999999999
it put me in a position to speak but not

4765.63 --> 4773.07
react I guess you could say and it

4770.55 --> 4776.31

4844.42 --> 4852.22
I long time ago after after friction

4848.98 --> 4854.589999999999
comes great reward and I think that um

4852.22 --> 4858.150000000001
you know these three years of three

4854.59 --> 4862.0
years apart now it's it's grown us

4858.15 --> 4863.469999999999
stronger you know and you know and what

4862.0 --> 4866.77
what she had to deal with it differently

4863.47 --> 4868.4800000000005
matured her so I'm I just I just can't

4866.77 --> 4870.46
wait to wrap my arms around there and

4868.48 --> 4874.089999999999
just just you know say hello again

4870.46 --> 4876.46

4876.46 --> 4880.6
all through the screen you know to the

4879.01 --> 4884.7300000000005
limits that the doctors pretty much

4880.6 --> 4887.530000000001
never expected her to reach oh man I

4884.73 --> 4889.839999999999
it's it's it's getting getting a bit

4887.53 --> 4892.509999999999

very good yeah no thanks alright we got

5036.48 --> 5044.879999999999
in the panel psychics and music man and

5042.11 --> 5049.19
yeah of course brenda was still there so

5044.88 --> 5051.1990000000005
I have welcome to the panel yeah

5049.19 --> 5052.669999999999
for the shoutout and hi sheets been a

5051.199 --> 5055.54
while since I've seen you

5052.67 --> 5058.82
it's a pleasure open up this hangout

5055.54 --> 5060.65
it's also notice that Brendan is here I

5058.82 --> 5062.96
only have this came in a little bit

5060.65 --> 5064.25
because I'm heading to work and the

5062.96 --> 5066.7390000000005
reason why I jumped in the finest

5064.25 --> 5068.66
panelists because I wasn't at hang out

5066.739 --> 5071.78
with with Brenda it was very interesting

5068.66 --> 5075.68
but she got kind of cut off and she

5071.78 --> 5078.469
wasn't able to present a certain opinion

5075.68 --> 5080.42
based on a difference between a man and

5078.469 --> 5082.31
a woman and I just definitely wanted to

5080.42 --> 5084.14
hear more of her source about

5082.31 --> 5087.05
philosophical belief on that part

5084.14 --> 5088.85
because it's somewhat it I find it

5087.05 --> 5093.89
interesting because it's not had that

5088.85 --> 5096.26
has to be a physical nature it also she

5093.89 --> 5099.320000000001
was pretty much describing the part of

5096.26 --> 5102.1990000000005
the philosophy of the mind itself so

5099.32 --> 5104.12
that what she was cut off and I needed

5102.199 --> 5108.379999999999
to find out exactly what she meant by

5104.12 --> 5118.849999999999
that so alright okay burned up in there

5108.38 --> 5121.88
if you can answer that I mean what I've

5118.85 --> 5125.719
seen the whole gender multiple gender

5121.88 --> 5129.53
thingy that's good it's basically more

5125.719 --> 5134.5
about the identity the psychological

5129.53 --> 5139.929999999999
identity of the person and how they say

5134.5 --> 5143.36
hello and hold on it's not finished yet

5139.93 --> 5148.58
its identity based and it's not actually

5143.36 --> 5151.639999999999
the the word gender is kind of Lent

5148.58 --> 5154.43
originally from biology in this case and

5151.64 --> 5157.280000000001
then moved into a different territory

5154.43 --> 5159.2300000000005
the psychology territory and that's how

5157.28 --> 5162.139999999999
it really works it's very confusing

5159.23 --> 5167.9
there by the way but you have four you

5162.14 --> 5174.650000000001
have what is it the your genetic gender

5167.9 --> 5178.16
mm-hmm and you have a social gender role

5174.65 --> 5180.98
thingy like certain attitude and then

5178.16 --> 5181.82
you have the yeah the the gender

5180.98 --> 5184.94
fluidity

5181.82 --> 5188.36
which is really in in the identity the

5184.94 --> 5192.0199999999995
personal identity now so it's all

5188.36 --> 5194.089999999999
different I mean I'm not gender fluid at

5192.02 --> 5197.079000000001
all gender fluid means people that

5194.09 --> 5201.2300000000005
switch back and forth I don't do that

5197.079 --> 5203.8099999999995
but you switch I call gender fluid the

5201.23 --> 5205.69
moment you switch at any point if you're

5203.81 --> 5209.030000000001
going to switch from how you were born

5205.69 --> 5216.888999999999
once you start to decide on your gender

5209.03 --> 5218.509999999999
identity then trend pathetic oh it's

5216.889 --> 5220.219
snowflakes call about the society these

5218.51 --> 5222.5
days so when's it going to end

5220.219 --> 5224.449
the world is totally [Â __Â ] man it's not

5222.5 --> 5226.969
gonna stand up to this it's not gonna

5224.449 --> 5229.339999999999
end right off yourself you can just get

5226.969 --> 5232.34
over yourself that music man it's not

5229.34 --> 5234.9490000000005
gonna end but what may end though is the

5232.34 --> 5238.400000000001
media freaking high pinning hyping it up

5234.949 --> 5240.5599999999995
all the time and politics giving it all

5238.4 --> 5242.989
the power that may end at some point but

5240.56 --> 5245.719
there's always been snowflakes seriously

5242.989 --> 5250.098999999999
there's always been snowflakes yeah yeah

5245.719 --> 5252.26
music is being a boy boy I mean that's

5250.099 --> 5256.34
just a boy no you just being a child a

5252.26 --> 5257.0
child will be a child you 18 what's your

5256.34 --> 5261.409000000001
the 10 gold

5257.0 --> 5265.969
you're gonna size their gender your mic

5261.409 --> 5275.929
is very crappy yeah we can't really

5265.969 --> 5279.82
understand you music man you're your

5275.929 --> 5279.82
worst like ever

5280.51 --> 5285.77
yeah so buy a lot it's biological sex

5283.969 --> 5293.57
that's the sex that you're born when

5285.77 --> 5297.909000000001
you're any better no gender the gender

5293.57 --> 5300.86
is is a social is a social construct

5297.909 --> 5304.429
right so it's socially constructed a

5300.86 --> 5308.21
psychological so well it's it's so it

5304.429 --> 5311.6900000000005
has to do with the society and stuff so

5308.21 --> 5314.809
so your your natal sex and natal sex

5311.69 --> 5315.379999999999
varies to there people who are born who

5314.809 --> 5318.41
are

5315.38 --> 5320.51
neither male nor female there's plenty

5318.41 --> 5325.22
of those people borrowing their intimate

5320.51 --> 5327.5
infracells the people who are have big

5325.22 --> 5330.29
doin's genitalia they're born all the

5327.5 --> 5334.04
time probably every day so are they

5330.29 --> 5336.8
genetically neither male nor female yes

5334.04 --> 5338.0199999999995
oh really how are there an ex-wife -

5336.8 --> 5341.09
divided

5338.02 --> 5346.31
well that's not what department your

5341.09 --> 5348.83
your your your genitals yeah it is no it

5346.31 --> 5351.1900000000005
isn't really no really no what

5348.83 --> 5356.32
determines your genitals is your is your

5351.19 --> 5360.0199999999995
environment in the womb in in many cases

5356.32 --> 5363.92
right so it's not determined solely by

5360.02 --> 5367.01
your genetic inheritance oh really so

5363.92 --> 5369.2
you can differ what type of gender your

5367.01 --> 5371.570000000001
kid is going to be if you eat certain

5369.2 --> 5374.12
foods in a certain period or another

5371.57 --> 5376.3099999999995
yeah really well certain foods but

5374.12 --> 5378.83
certainly drugs there have been drugs in

5376.31 --> 5382.31
the past that did exactly that they took

5378.83 --> 5390.11
them off the market really that would

5382.31 --> 5392.660000000001
like what ah brother today yeah I don't

5390.11 --> 5394.13
know what what drugs it is but I do know

5392.66 --> 5396.98
that in the history and history there

5394.13 --> 5399.47
have been problems with certain birth

5396.98 --> 5403.209999999999
control medications and and it would

5399.47 --> 5407.09
affect the the development of the child

5403.21 --> 5412.61
it's not a strict xx XY thing either

5407.09 --> 5416.6900000000005
people have X X X Y X X X Y X you know

5412.61 --> 5422.66
what XY Y there's all kinds of variation

5416.69 --> 5424.79
and you know most people are born at one

5422.66 --> 5428.75
end to the other but there's variation

5424.79 --> 5431.39
in between right but it does always have

5428.75 --> 5433.7
like if there's a female then or if

5431.39 --> 5436.990000000001
there's me a male factor then there has

5433.7 --> 5442.79
to be a Y chromosome it's very simple

5436.99 --> 5451.79
they said I would well that's true isn't

5442.79 --> 5454.33
it my mother though it's not great but a

5451.79 --> 5465.38
little better than last time

5454.33 --> 5468.79
the choppiness you know I couldn't make

5465.38 --> 5468.79
out what you use it you know

5470.26 --> 5475.7300000000005
okay I couldn't make out that you were

5472.37 --> 5477.62
you gonna say F it but only because I

5475.73 --> 5483.29
realized what you were gonna say not

5477.62 --> 5485.33
because I could hear it that's Brandon

5483.29 --> 5489.07
you think the very first human prototype

5485.33 --> 5489.07
could have been in that rajala store

5490.6 --> 5497.570000000001
there's no human prototype somebody's

5494.87 --> 5501.44
gotta be one oh really

5497.57 --> 5503.99
yeah we evolved we evolved from a

5501.44 --> 5506.389999999999
different species from monkeys right

5503.99 --> 5508.3099999999995
from monkeys bro no we didn't come you

5506.39 --> 5512.51
fell out of a monkey's butt - did you

5508.31 --> 5515.120000000001
Brenda no you're confused about how

5512.51 --> 5517.070000000001
reproduction happens - oh yeah people

5515.12 --> 5520.01
come out of vaginas yeah because you're

5517.07 --> 5522.74
oh really they do know I think you fell

5520.01 --> 5524.72
out of a monkey's butt Brenda no if you

5522.74 --> 5527.09
believe in evolution then there's only

5524.72 --> 5529.070000000001
one explanation as to how you came into

5527.09 --> 5530.0
being and that is you fell out of a

5529.07 --> 5532.7
monkey's butt

5530.0 --> 5535.55
yeah that's just you don't understand

5532.7 --> 5543.08
evolution at all we came from

5535.55 --> 5546.860000000001
you don't understand humor humans

5543.08 --> 5549.11
evolved from another earlier primate

5546.86 --> 5551.2699999999995
yeah we are I'm [Â __Â ] fish frog I

5549.11 --> 5555.95
know we are we are playing them IRA's

5551.27 --> 5561.950000000001
are names for eggs teeth no yeah we are

5555.95 --> 5565.04
we're Apes yeah of course okay I think

5561.95 --> 5567.4
we're about as much apes as we are rain

5565.04 --> 5567.4
worms

5568.17 --> 5572.969
yes I think yeah there's genetic

5571.13 --> 5574.8
synchronizations with all kinds of

5572.969 --> 5579.449
creatures the whole genetic

5574.8 --> 5581.16
synchronicity let us suppose that's

5579.449 --> 5584.58
where they base it on that's where the

5581.16 --> 5586.82
evolution version is race on the genetic

5584.58 --> 5591.449
relation yeah that's what they do

5586.82 --> 5594.049999999999
it's more similar now but similarities

5591.449 --> 5596.73
on the outside is not create that it's

5594.05 --> 5600.0
music man sorry dude I am gonna kick you

5596.73 --> 5602.129999999999
you're so audibly disrupted sorry

5600.0 --> 5607.5
nothing personal just your sound sucks

5602.13 --> 5609.6
and I don't want to hear that [Â __Â ] yeah

5607.5 --> 5611.64
but he wasn't gonna make any useful

5609.6 --> 5615.81
sound out of it sorry try again later

5611.64 --> 5618.6
nothing personal again but no the

5615.81 --> 5621.360000000001
genetic relation is supposed to be the

5618.6 --> 5624.570000000001
direct link to the evolutionary chain

5621.36 --> 5626.61
that's obviously well obviously yeah

5624.57 --> 5628.4
well obviously there are actually things

5626.61 --> 5631.71
out there that are genetically more

5628.4 --> 5635.549999999999
related to humans from that theoretical

5631.71 --> 5637.89
angle than Apes yeah that is true yeah

5635.55 --> 5641.54
yeah there's lots of creatures out there

5637.89 --> 5644.37
that have a lot of genetic similarities

5641.54 --> 5646.92
yeah that's just not true that is true

5644.37 --> 5650.01
I've heard it are that what other

5646.92 --> 5653.07
species are you think you know I wasn't

5650.01 --> 5654.780000000001
into rain worm yeah what what

5653.07 --> 5660.049999999999
similarities do you have with the

5654.78 --> 5663.09
ringworm genetically apparently a lot

5660.05 --> 5665.67
you just repeated your claim yeah that's

5663.09 --> 5668.07
right because that is the claim there

5665.67 --> 5670.92
yes it's not about me it's not about the

5668.07 --> 5674.04
outward similarities about the genetic

5670.92 --> 5675.929
synchronicity yeah that's not a real

5674.04 --> 5678.51
thing that is that is what the

5675.929 --> 5681.42
evolutionary theory at this time is

5678.51 --> 5683.6990000000005
based on on genetics it's done no it's

5681.42 --> 5687.27
not you're just making up words no it

5683.699 --> 5689.699
says how much how close another type of

5687.27 --> 5692.070000000001
species is to our species on the

5689.699 --> 5694.799999999999
evolutionary scale it's based on genetic

5692.07 --> 5696.57
synchronicity Brenda you don't have to

5694.8 --> 5698.400000000001
tell me I'm wrong because I'm damn well

5696.57 --> 5699.989
right about this oh you don't know what

5698.4 --> 5700.5199999999995
you're talking about I do know what I'm

5699.989 --> 5701.75
talking

5700.52 --> 5703.13
you don't know what the hell you're

5701.75 --> 5704.0
talking about because you're just a

5703.13 --> 5705.9800000000005
religious zealot

5704.0 --> 5709.01
there's just spouting [Â __Â ] all day

5705.98 --> 5712.25
long our quarters that were closest

5709.01 --> 5714.89
ancestor are the chimpanzees right they

5712.25 --> 5718.04
have 98 point one percent similarity

5714.89 --> 5722.06
with human DNA right it shows right oh

5718.04 --> 5726.05
my molarity

5722.06 --> 5728.6900000000005
is it really our direct relative do we

5726.05 --> 5729.79
stand out from it good where does it gel

5728.69 --> 5735.0199999999995
happen to have

5729.79 --> 5737.3
yeah similar build which is monkey yeah

5735.02 --> 5739.01
we're always trying to say that the

5737.3 --> 5743.47
synchronicity is that we all encompass

5739.01 --> 5746.27
some relationship with with everything

5743.47 --> 5749.45
the patchwork is from what I was saying

5746.27 --> 5751.040000000001
is that there's no proof yet that you

5749.45 --> 5753.26
know that we are coming from gives other

5751.04 --> 5755.3
than I do agree with you that we do have

5753.26 --> 5758.35
a strong similarities among keys based

5755.3 --> 5760.58
on genetics and its physical attributes

5758.35 --> 5765.14
among the things that what they can do

5760.58 --> 5767.9
but I don't see the the actual existence

5765.14 --> 5770.660000000001
that we continued from them although I

5767.9 --> 5773.509999999999
can assert my own personal philosophical

5770.66 --> 5777.349999999999
belief that since we've you know been

5773.51 --> 5779.66
since I've came here and have noticed

5777.35 --> 5782.660000000001
that we've used towards the family tree

5779.66 --> 5784.639999999999
and the tree of life there could be a

5782.66 --> 5786.86
strong possibility we may have come from

5784.64 --> 5788.96
a plant since we are actually plant

5786.86 --> 5791.54
based and we always strive to look for

5788.96 --> 5794.66
remedies which is from the plant or the

5791.54 --> 5797.0
root itself so therefore may believe

5794.66 --> 5798.7699999999995
this let me finish friend it for one

5797.0 --> 5801.17
second I'm almost there so it's too late

5798.77 --> 5804.26
for okay I'm so sorry guys

5801.17 --> 5806.39
oh well anyways my point is that there

5804.26 --> 5809.12
could be a strong possibility that the

5806.39 --> 5811.700000000001
very first human or human prototype or

5809.12 --> 5814.88
humans may have come from from actually

5811.7 --> 5817.55
the tree of life which is a pod itself a

5814.88 --> 5821.63
living being itself and I think we came

5817.55 --> 5824.59
from a potted plant which like a ball

5821.63 --> 5827.87
there are literally the living right

5824.59 --> 5829.9400000000005
well I'm trying to avoid all the all the

5827.87 --> 5832.76
let's say obstacles in the middle I'm

5829.94 --> 5833.659
just bringing us in synchronicity or

5832.76 --> 5835.939
into the circle

5833.659 --> 5839.388999999999
or that we can say the creator itself

5835.939 --> 5842.150000000001
this year and and and the fruit the

5839.389 --> 5844.219
fruit of the tree is is actually for us

5842.15 --> 5846.709
and that's what we're coming from either

5844.219 --> 5852.409
a tree a plant or whatever it is but I

5846.709 --> 5854.3
don't have evidence this is just you

5852.409 --> 5856.999
know I'm interested in finding out more

5854.3 --> 5859.6990000000005
so you you think that what we can't were

5856.999 --> 5861.769
like pod people we came from a pod or

5859.699 --> 5863.959
something sure I mean I this is where I

5861.769 --> 5866.329000000001
started growing they're looking at the

5863.959 --> 5868.729
fruits now the fruits that hasn't been

5866.329 --> 5871.82
touched and I've looked at the durian

5868.729 --> 5873.709
fruit and the things that it's not meant

5871.82 --> 5877.688999999999
to be eaten and and it looks like an

5873.709 --> 5880.159
actual like like porcupines stuff like

5877.689 --> 5882.530000000001
it's like not the meant to be touched by

5880.159 --> 5885.169
anything but when you cut it and look at

5882.53 --> 5887.3
it it looks like an embryonic sac but if

5885.169 --> 5890.03
you if we haven't touched that bird that

5887.3 --> 5891.499
piccola tree for hundreds and or maybe

5890.03 --> 5893.78
even thousands of years

5891.499 --> 5896.659
if that tree may evolve it has but it

5893.78 --> 5899.84
has that opportunity to actually wow I

5896.659 --> 5903.049999999999
have to intervene I think your theory is

5899.84 --> 5905.479
a bit fruity in this case I don't think

5903.05 --> 5908.599
there is a similarities to a human

5905.479 --> 5911.929
organism and a fruit fruit is a very

5908.599 --> 5914.9890000000005
specific type of design that is meant to

5911.929 --> 5916.55
be consumed that is the function of the

5914.989 --> 5918.728999999999
fruit either to be consumed by a

5916.55 --> 5922.909000000001
creature and thus spread out the seed or

5918.729 --> 5924.9490000000005
to basically I create a feeding ground

5922.909 --> 5925.759999999999
like a rotting process that could

5924.949 --> 5928.638999999999
ferment

5925.76 --> 5933.05
the seed locally that's a fruit I don't

5928.639 --> 5935.479
think humans or even animals have

5933.05 --> 5937.789
similarities to that really like that

5935.479 --> 5940.669
but it's make sound kind of a little bit

5937.789 --> 5946.309
in but it's a circle of life and in a

5940.669 --> 5954.28
way yeah it does sound ballistic what

5946.309 --> 5957.05
I'm gonna call it fruity ballistic so I

5954.28 --> 5960.499
don't know how you came out on this idea

5957.05 --> 5963.38
that humans are like sprouted from a pod

5960.499 --> 5965.209
or a seed from a tree from the original

5963.38 --> 5966.87
Tree of Life is that is that the idea

5965.209 --> 5969.12
yeah plan

5966.87 --> 5977.07
well that may be advanced plants who

5969.12 --> 5980.37
knows from the claim the clamp vital

5977.07 --> 5983.759999999999
yeah I'm I wouldn't be surprised if that

5980.37 --> 5985.71
is how we were made or rich but we were

5983.76 --> 5987.63
more silicon based originally and

5985.71 --> 5989.79
there's people talking about this as

5987.63 --> 5991.5
well like who we used to be kind of

5989.79 --> 5994.41
different and then we would transform we

5991.5 --> 5996.54
were made into flesh rather than silicon

5994.41 --> 5998.58
or the like gay dreamers who wasn't my

5996.54 --> 6000.68
chat earlier talks about that a lot so

5998.58 --> 6002.93
you think we might have been silicon

6000.68 --> 6005.21
based at one time well well whenever

6002.93 --> 6008.39
that time was it's gonna be very long

6005.21 --> 6011.09
ago very well well I just was wondering

6008.39 --> 6014.81
what we had montien definitely pre

6011.09 --> 6017.3
Atlantean ancient silicon life but yeah

6014.81 --> 6021.5
there's still silica trees out there

6017.3 --> 6026.72
right now the red that's up for debate

6021.5 --> 6028.28
but yeah there are suggestions of what

6026.72 --> 6030.83
are these silicate trees are not

6028.28 --> 6034.009999999999
familiar with that the platform's no

6030.83 --> 6036.32
trees yeah what you're talking about

6034.01 --> 6038.21
well then you're an ignorant idiot

6036.32 --> 6041.09
because it's been out there forever and

6038.21 --> 6043.7
talked about it forever on Flat Earth so

6041.09 --> 6045.2
yeah no trees if you don't know what

6043.7 --> 6048.349999999999
that means then you are absolutely

6045.2 --> 6051.38
ignorant then you're totally ignorant go

6048.35 --> 6054.110000000001
on like so go and do some research well

6051.38 --> 6056.39
that would just tell me I don't know for

6054.11 --> 6059.17
me if you don't even you can't just

6056.39 --> 6062.75
explain it so quickly it's very visual

6059.17 --> 6064.7
just go and search on YouTube no trees

6062.75 --> 6067.76
or flat earth there's bound to pop up

6064.7 --> 6070.07
several versions there were several

6067.76 --> 6073.820000000001
narrations even and it explains a

6070.07 --> 6078.98
concept that certain type of mountainous

6073.82 --> 6084.5599999999995
areas seem to have this staggering

6078.98 --> 6087.62
similarity to the to how a cut down tree

6084.56 --> 6090.530000000001
looks and it is suggested that they were

6087.62 --> 6092.96
once giant trees and that they were cut

6090.53 --> 6096.98
down and the rest like petrified or they

6092.96 --> 6100.05
may have been silicon plant life like

6096.98 --> 6103.379999999999
okay okay it's I hadn't heard of that

6100.05 --> 6107.610000000001
idea before and you noticed it's next to

6103.38 --> 6109.92
a - to tighten theory that certain

6107.61 --> 6111.57
mountain ranges also looked like they're

6109.92 --> 6114.6900000000005
very much they could have been like

6111.57 --> 6117.54
Giants Titans that just fell down and

6114.69 --> 6119.579
petrified or became one with the

6117.54 --> 6122.849
landscape there's a lot of those as well

6119.579 --> 6131.159
there's a lot of well how big were these

6122.849 --> 6134.099
Titans kilometers kilometers yeah some

6131.159 --> 6136.589999999999
of them different sizes yeah it is a

6134.099 --> 6139.469
whole different scale totally that's not

6136.59 --> 6143.159000000001
even like humanoid Giants which were

6139.469 --> 6145.65
like 20 meters at most I think during

6143.159 --> 6149.638999999999
the Atlantean Age but yeah those

6145.65 --> 6154.5
creatures were tightens and tightens are

6149.639 --> 6156.6900000000005
just beyond imagining we are ants - all

6154.5 --> 6159.9
of that it's great so everything was

6156.69 --> 6161.909
huge one listen I have to get going to

6159.9 --> 6164.04
actually walk into work I just wanted to

6161.909 --> 6165.839999999999
leave that plenty with this seed and

6164.04 --> 6168.0
maybe you guys add some water to it and

6165.84 --> 6169.619000000001
it's doing wonders a bit a little more

6168.0 --> 6171.0
because I definitely to come back on

6169.619 --> 6173.13
this type of discussion it's very

6171.0 --> 6175.739
interesting actually we can build on

6173.13 --> 6178.71
this and thank you for inviting me bye

6175.739 --> 6180.718999999999
Brenda bye Arwen eight sheets and take

6178.71 --> 6184.7390000000005
care take everybody alright thanks for

6180.719 --> 6187.079
joining the panel psychics so I I'm just

6184.739 --> 6188.968999999999
asking questions and I'm not being

6187.079 --> 6191.25
competitive I'm just because I'm

6188.969 --> 6194.57
interested and I'm just wondering where

6191.25 --> 6198.54
would you find evidence for these Titans

6194.57 --> 6200.73
well I've actually discussed that first

6198.54 --> 6204.15
it's observations and then just

6200.73 --> 6207.03
deductions in the shape and seeing is

6204.15 --> 6210.0199999999995
this a humanoid creature that is lying

6207.03 --> 6212.909
here and what parts of it has have been

6210.02 --> 6214.7390000000005
broken like broken off over the ages

6212.909 --> 6217.429
what happened to it they are part of the

6214.739 --> 6220.259999999999
landscape did the earth quakes perhaps

6217.429 --> 6222.57
make certain parts collapse and then

6220.26 --> 6224.67
there is the content of the actual

6222.57 --> 6227.73
mountain ranges that do appear to be

6224.67 --> 6231.869
giants what is in them is there some

6227.73 --> 6233.25
kind of consistency in the stone types

6231.869 --> 6237.69
within that woods

6233.25 --> 6240.42
just organs for example of the specific

6237.69 --> 6242.28
presumed giant size that it would be now

6240.42 --> 6244.05
that's very interesting research that I

6242.28 --> 6245.37
like to know a little bit more about and

6244.05 --> 6249.360000000001
I don't think a lot of people have

6245.37 --> 6251.19
really done that yet but the yeah there

6249.36 --> 6255.9
is a possibility that that might

6251.19 --> 6257.82
actually be a thing so so you so for

6255.9 --> 6260.849999999999
instance you think that if we find like

6257.82 --> 6263.91
veins of minerals and things like that

6260.85 --> 6267.18
in mountains that once yeah in certain

6263.91 --> 6270.63
arrangements in certain patterns in

6267.18 --> 6272.88
accordance to the shape of the body the

6270.63 --> 6276.18
presumed body yeah these kind of hints

6272.88 --> 6278.22
that they're like petrified wood clearly

6276.18 --> 6279.93
is wood it's petrified but it's wood

6278.22 --> 6283.530000000001
because it has the same structure as

6279.93 --> 6287.55
wood and so thus I personally would hope

6283.53 --> 6291.99
to see ya proof that that that these

6287.55 --> 6295.83
giant petrified Titans also were organic

6291.99 --> 6297.75
type creatures in some way once well so

6295.83 --> 6300.39
you think that when you look at a

6297.75 --> 6304.77
landscape and and it looks like maybe a

6300.39 --> 6307.38
body laying down then your your

6304.77 --> 6310.110000000001
deduction is that that was once a Titan

6307.38 --> 6313.89
that could be yeah my good being oh yeah

6310.11 --> 6316.429999999999
could have been okay and then then the

6313.89 --> 6319.35
fact that we can find like veins of

6316.43 --> 6323.76
different metals like silver gold stuff

6319.35 --> 6328.740000000001
right those veins and the impact but not

6323.76 --> 6330.87
just veins it would have to be it's not

6328.74 --> 6333.5599999999995
even about the type of material it's

6330.87 --> 6337.17
about the pattern it would be containing

6333.56 --> 6339.75
like is the Vale is the vein of a

6337.17 --> 6342.96
certain metal for example like a gold

6339.75 --> 6346.71
thing is it actually similar to the vein

6342.96 --> 6349.83
alarm for example or in an arm or is it

6346.71 --> 6353.34
just a chunk that happens to be randomly

6349.83 --> 6356.1
placed see it's about the pattern of the

6353.34 --> 6358.59
of what the mountainous thing is

6356.1 --> 6360.660000000001
consistent of the patterns of it does it

6358.59 --> 6363.900000000001
strike have striking similarities to

6360.66 --> 6365.13
physiology that is the question my

6363.9 --> 6369.67
question I

6365.13 --> 6372.429
so where did these Titans come from I

6369.67 --> 6376.2390000000005
mean and how long ago was this there's

6372.429 --> 6382.42
no way to tell how do you how do you

6376.239 --> 6385.209999999999
date rock yeah you have to date nuclear

6382.42 --> 6387.13
materials maybe perhaps within the rock

6385.21 --> 6389.139
to get any kind of indication but still

6387.13 --> 6392.139
then that would be highly speculative

6389.139 --> 6396.01
it's gonna be very long ago and there is

6392.139 --> 6399.1900000000005
absolutely no way to find out how they

6396.01 --> 6401.289000000001
came into being because yeah there's

6399.19 --> 6404.469
only just remnants so we can only

6401.289 --> 6408.909
speculate even exactly what they have

6404.469 --> 6415.059
been before were they somehow flesh or

6408.909 --> 6417.4
were they a rock being boof yeah okay

6415.059 --> 6419.829000000001
that that would require ages of research

6417.4 --> 6423.789
in my opinion how did the flesh turn

6419.829 --> 6427.42
into stone well things can't petrify

6423.789 --> 6432.309
relatively quickly it's a proven process

6427.42 --> 6439.6900000000005
oh really yeah there's even petrified

6432.309 --> 6441.820000000001
feet in shoes out there out there yeah

6439.69 --> 6444.879999999999
out there I have facial hair on camera

6441.82 --> 6447.759999999999
you can see it like it's a shoe with a

6444.88 --> 6449.76
foot in it broken off you can still even

6447.76 --> 6452.320000000001
seen the bone in the part of the foot

6449.76 --> 6454.289000000001
somebody lost the foot in the mud or

6452.32 --> 6456.5199999999995
something or they died and the foot

6454.289 --> 6459.5199999999995
petrified in a in a puddle of water

6456.52 --> 6461.860000000001
under certain conditions and it happened

6459.52 --> 6465.13
apparently really quickly otherwise it

6461.86 --> 6468.19
would have rotten in over the course of

6465.13 --> 6470.05
just a few days I think I would have to

6468.19 --> 6472.629999999999
dig back it's like been five years since

6470.05 --> 6474.9400000000005
I last did dug into that concept

6472.63 --> 6477.67
there's channels out there that do treat

6474.94 --> 6480.19
the rapid possible the possibility of

6477.67 --> 6483.6990000000005
rapid petrification and it changes a

6480.19 --> 6488.129999999999
whole range of things especially if

6483.699 --> 6492.129999999999
you're gonna go by mud mud fossil theory

6488.13 --> 6495.159000000001
okay so the studio sixty-eight thank you

6492.13 --> 6497.26
yeah one how are you might do good am i

6495.159 --> 6498.348999999999
coming through our kite yes loud and

6497.26 --> 6502.13
clear

6498.349 --> 6505.4890000000005
beautiful beautiful yeah hi to the other

6502.13 --> 6509.2390000000005
guys on the pin how young we got Brenda

6505.489 --> 6512.0599999999995
currently only Brenda oh you're still

6509.239 --> 6516.199
Emily's yeah I haven't spoke to Brenda

6512.06 --> 6524.929
befo really she's a regular on the

6516.199 --> 6526.879999999999
debate soon the Flat Earth debates so

6524.929 --> 6531.79
you think that there were forests of

6526.88 --> 6535.219
these these super tall trees and these

6531.79 --> 6538.04
super tall people who are miles tall

6535.219 --> 6540.469
right right right

6538.04 --> 6542.63
they could be is it's a concept it's a

6540.469 --> 6548.599
conceptual theory with a lot of heavily

6542.63 --> 6553.369
suggestive visual leads okay the world

6548.599 --> 6556.79
could have been a giant's world in ages

6553.369 --> 6559.75
far past and that we've become miniature

6556.79 --> 6563.38
offspring of it eventually in some way

6559.75 --> 6569.57
well how come they're not around anymore

6563.38 --> 6571.28
cuz they died well what killed him I

6569.57 --> 6573.0199999999995
mean somebody you know they obviously

6571.28 --> 6575.75
would have had children and stuff like

6573.02 --> 6578.599
that who knows realization and all that

6575.75 --> 6580.73
yeah but you can only speculate about it

6578.599 --> 6582.59
because there's no writings as far as I

6580.73 --> 6586.61
know there's a maybe a couple of myths

6582.59 --> 6590.05
but yeah who knows what it is maybe the

6586.61 --> 6593.119
freaking atmosphere burned up look in my

6590.05 --> 6596.150000000001
conceptualization the age of Wonders

6593.119 --> 6599.03
which is before the Atlantean age there

6596.15 --> 6601.3099999999995
that's the time these Titans and these

6599.03 --> 6602.599
giant things would have been there and I

6601.31 --> 6605.06
theorized that

6602.599 --> 6606.59
yeah it was all burned everything just

6605.06 --> 6608.780000000001
burned the atmosphere burned up

6606.59 --> 6612.139
everything just choked to death and just

6608.78 --> 6615.199
mega Cataclysm and that is what just

6612.139 --> 6618.4400000000005
killed most of these big things and only

6615.199 --> 6620.239
some small creatures that would have

6618.44 --> 6623.15
been around maybe even created by the

6620.239 --> 6626.0599999999995
the Titans might have survived in like

6623.15 --> 6627.619
caves that's how I conceptualize it so

6626.06 --> 6630.6
the atmosphere burned up but we still

6627.619 --> 6633.049999999999
have an atmosphere so yeah but this

6630.6 --> 6636.870000000001
that's bread over the ages again

6633.05 --> 6640.47
atmosphere breeds by planets and their

6636.87 --> 6644.46
atmosphere was in this concept likely in

6640.47 --> 6647.37
the time of the Titans much much thicker

6644.46 --> 6651.33
much more under pressure much richer in

6647.37 --> 6654.8099999999995
oxygen and and everything and that

6651.33 --> 6657.18
probably ignited at some point okay so

6654.81 --> 6660.09
we originally had a thicker atmosphere

6657.18 --> 6663.66
higher in oxygen and then that burned

6660.09 --> 6668.1
right and then it was replaced trees the

6663.66 --> 6670.26
trees breed atmosphere right and so then

6668.1 --> 6673.47
it was replaced by the trees eventually

6670.26 --> 6676.77
over time that is that the idea the idea

6673.47 --> 6680.34
was is that in the age of Wonders there

6676.77 --> 6684.410000000001
were giant things all creating giant

6680.34 --> 6688.59
amounts of things as giant things do so

6684.41 --> 6691.41
Giants create creating in giant amounts

6688.59 --> 6693.75
of havoc probably I don't know they

6691.41 --> 6695.72
might have had like psionic powers and

6693.75 --> 6699.99
be able to create things with that

6695.72 --> 6702.51
inventing inventing technologies and the

6699.99 --> 6705.92
giant trees would have likely been

6702.51 --> 6710.400000000001
breathing huge quantities of air

6705.92 --> 6713.49
processing it like yeah creating a rich

6710.4 --> 6716.129999999999
atmosphere that that's what i theorize

6713.49 --> 6718.74
and then yeah how that all came to an

6716.13 --> 6721.11
end I don't know it it probably burned

6718.74 --> 6722.969999999999
up in some way and that just killed it

6721.11 --> 6725.25
all maybe even like made everything

6722.97 --> 6730.56
choked by a vacuum that would come out

6725.25 --> 6732.69
of the flash burn of I don't know well

6730.56 --> 6735.660000000001
the biblical account of giants is that

6732.69 --> 6739.349999999999
were just most of them were destroyed in

6735.66 --> 6743.639999999999
the flood all right well I believe that

6739.35 --> 6748.1900000000005
John trace existed pre-flood right but I

6743.64 --> 6748.1900000000005
believe that the flood happened after

6748.88 --> 6755.22
the the burning was the age of Wonders

6753.0 --> 6758.13
after the burning happened that's pretty

6755.22 --> 6761.400000000001
much when the smaller things took over

6758.13 --> 6764.13
the things that survived they worked the

6761.4 --> 6766.53
ashes of the world basically they could

6764.13 --> 6770.55
survive on the lower pressure atmosphere

6766.53 --> 6773.159
that was left and and then the Atlantean

6770.55 --> 6776.219
age came from that and then again Giants

6773.159 --> 6779.849999999999
came back through flesh the flesh Giants

6776.219 --> 6785.19
and humans and yeah the building the

6779.85 --> 6786.900000000001
pyramids all the antiquity was revived

6785.19 --> 6788.69
from what was before in the age of

6786.9 --> 6792.449
Wonders probably created by these

6788.69 --> 6795.57
overlords or whatever these amazing

6792.449 --> 6798.089999999999
Nephilim like creatures and yeah that

6795.57 --> 6801.0599999999995
was the intent in age and dadan the

6798.09 --> 6803.07
flood happened that ruined that part and

6801.06 --> 6805.46
that probably has to do with because

6803.07 --> 6807.509999999999
yeah their utilization of electrics

6805.46 --> 6810.179
electromagnetics and the pyramids and

6807.51 --> 6813.719
all that and something happened war and

6810.179 --> 6816.929
yeah and a giant flood and then most of

6813.719 --> 6820.139
the Giants basically perished in that

6816.929 --> 6821.55
and then only just a few smaller giant

6820.139 --> 6824.67
remained and started interbreeding

6821.55 --> 6828.409000000001
because humanity was starting to break

6824.67 --> 6831.03
out and and like become the victors and

6828.409 --> 6832.7699999999995
human empires and the Roman Empire and

6831.03 --> 6835.08
everything started up basically killing

6832.77 --> 6836.790000000001
the remnants of the Giants and erasing

6835.08 --> 6842.55
history in building the heliocentric

6836.79 --> 6844.38
nurse's so so yes Dan 68 youth you don't

6842.55 --> 6849.9890000000005
agree with this but you think that the

6844.38 --> 6853.650000000001
flood was more important well there's a

6849.989 --> 6856.65
lot that we don't know pre flood or we

6853.65 --> 6862.62
have this kind of a misconception that

6856.65 --> 6864.599999999999
the times pre-flood were kind of like

6862.62 --> 6869.28
they were post what kind of Stone Age or

6864.6 --> 6871.05
very rural and that but there is some

6869.28 --> 6872.61
evidence that yeah there was jobs

6871.05 --> 6876.81
running around possibly a few dinosaurs

6872.61 --> 6881.19
running around the atmosphere was a lot

6876.81 --> 6886.620000000001
thicker as as I once said and support of

6881.19 --> 6888.659
these giant trees John people so you and

6886.62 --> 6894.78
then the flood came along but yeah

6888.659 --> 6897.9
before pre flood yeah no yes a bit of a

6894.78 --> 6900.179
mystery so so pre-flood there were the

6897.9 --> 6903.75
giant trees that were miles higher these

6900.179 --> 6906.14
people who were miles high that that was

6903.75 --> 6908.82
a thing that's what you think

6906.14 --> 6912.02
well there is strong evidence to suggest

6908.82 --> 6917.46
a lot of these mountains are actual

6912.02 --> 6921.59
where once trees because when if there

6917.46 --> 6924.87
is if there was a flood then they would

6921.59 --> 6927.4490000000005
not fossilize well yeah if I sighs they

6924.87 --> 6931.409
because organic matter turns to stone

6927.449 --> 6937.46
when it's you know when there's been a

6931.409 --> 6940.79
flood when this silt and all that so and

6937.46 --> 6944.67
there's a lot of flat top mountains

6940.79 --> 6947.19
which really there's evidence that they

6944.67 --> 6950.61
were giant trees and that they were cut

6947.19 --> 6952.71
down okay so these flat top that's

6950.61 --> 6954.719
evidence that they were trees and that

6952.71 --> 6958.02
they were cut down okay

6954.719 --> 6964.35
and then there was then there was the

6958.02 --> 6966.21
flood all right that's right that's

6964.35 --> 6968.219
correct yeah that's correct

6966.21 --> 6974.699
there's also a lot of interesting videos

6968.219 --> 6976.62
I've seen about rock formations that you

6974.699 --> 6981.178999999999
can see these giant some of these giants

6976.62 --> 6982.92
were sort of fossilized in rock and but

6981.179 --> 6983.64
yeah there's some interesting videos out

6982.92 --> 6988.11
there for sure

6983.64 --> 6990.6900000000005
I think free of mine too if I'm sorry

6988.11 --> 6994.0199999999995
buddy's channel he's got some

6990.69 --> 6997.25
interesting stuff but yeah it's a lot of

6994.02 --> 6997.25
stuff we don't know that's for sure

6997.67 --> 7006.92
okay so what about like dragons some

7001.82 --> 7009.17
people yeah yeah yeah well there is my

7006.92 --> 7014.87
hands of Darkness those sorry Owen go

7009.17 --> 7017.719
ahead dragons look in the age of Wonders

7014.87 --> 7021.23
before the burning there was pretty much

7017.719 --> 7024.59
anything you could ever conceive when it

7021.23 --> 7027.199
comes to creature types I think the

7024.59 --> 7029.21
Nephilim whoever did that had the

7027.199 --> 7031.46
capability to just trance morph

7029.21 --> 7033.38
creatures by will

7031.46 --> 7038.27
things were created all over the place

7033.38 --> 7040.9400000000005
that's what I think like a natural

7038.27 --> 7044.42
creatures not by God's design basically

7040.94 --> 7048.74
yeah generic mix yeah so dragons cure

7044.42 --> 7051.65
sure probably a huge dragons even but

7048.74 --> 7055.28
most of it just all died during the big

7051.65 --> 7057.23
flash fire and in the Atlantean Age

7055.28 --> 7059.33
maybe there were some dragons around and

7057.23 --> 7060.589999999999
they were probably hunted down because

7059.33 --> 7063.17
of they were incredibly dangerous

7060.59 --> 7066.47
creatures and maybe some more

7063.17 --> 7068.42
animalistic wild dragons just roaming

7066.47 --> 7070.46
around but yet all these ancient

7068.42 --> 7074.9
creatures have basically been wiped out

7070.46 --> 7077.09
by humanity mostly because of narrative

7074.9 --> 7079.28
control that they'd no know if there's

7077.09 --> 7083.21
something mysterious out there people's

7079.28 --> 7087.259999999999
imaginations go wild with it and they

7083.21 --> 7089.36
have to justify their narrative it's

7087.26 --> 7091.85
also why they removed the Giants because

7089.36 --> 7095.66
there's the evolution theory and that

7091.85 --> 7097.25
doesn't allow ancient Giants being there

7095.66 --> 7099.44
that doesn't make any sense with the

7097.25 --> 7101.36
Hulk historical context that we've been

7099.44 --> 7105.589999999999
presented with so that's why they

7101.36 --> 7107.9
categorically removed them and even

7105.59 --> 7108.2300000000005
their bones when they ran in run into

7107.9 --> 7112.79
them

7108.23 --> 7116.03
my dismiss Sounion so yep that's right

7112.79 --> 7117.26
Smithsonian came along and took the

7116.03 --> 7118.49
phones because when people found that

7117.26 --> 7119.96
they didn't know what to do so they

7118.49 --> 7122.33
called the some Sonia man they said yeah

7119.96 --> 7124.1
we will take care I'm getting the took

7122.33 --> 7128.72
away and yeah I'll take care of them

7124.1 --> 7131.81
what what boss did they take a bunch of

7128.72 --> 7134.900000000001
giants yeah yeah the ball joints they

7131.81 --> 7137.900000000001
took like two and a half meter three

7134.9 --> 7140.95
meter giants they're all they're being

7137.9 --> 7144.5199999999995
found all over the US on record even

7140.95 --> 7149.179999999999
right with red hair red hair Giants and

7144.52 --> 7151.76
yeah it wouldn't be surprised if in

7149.18 --> 7154.04
earlier ages they've been found a lot or

7151.76 --> 7155.96
all over Europe and they might still

7154.04 --> 7158.14
even be but yeah the Smithsonian has

7155.96 --> 7162.11
been there for some time and has been

7158.14 --> 7164.21
erasing a lot of history because that's

7162.11 --> 7165.17
all yeah they're hoarding a lot I know

7164.21 --> 7170.17
not hide

7165.17 --> 7173.63
destroying they destroy you erasing hmm

7170.17 --> 7181.219
and they replace things well that's

7173.63 --> 7183.9800000000005
terrible yeah it is it's evil so they so

7181.219 --> 7187.85
they destroyed bones of giants that did

7183.98 --> 7188.718999999999
did they destroy the bones of dragons

7187.85 --> 7192.1990000000005
and things too

7188.719 --> 7195.71
I don't know I don't think we didn't

7192.199 --> 7200.299999999999
they didn't sorry uh well I don't think

7195.71 --> 7204.53
that that there were any giant bones

7200.3 --> 7207.14
really left there I there's not been an

7204.53 --> 7209.48
abundance of dragons really oh

7207.14 --> 7213.679
there has been an abundance of giants

7209.48 --> 7216.65
though Tiger people's okay so that's the

7213.679 --> 7218.51
difference and look there are did you

7216.65 --> 7221.75
know for example about the mountain

7218.51 --> 7225.17
range in Morocco that is presumed and

7221.75 --> 7227.63
even foretold in legend to be like one

7225.17 --> 7230.2390000000005
of the original black dragons that is

7227.63 --> 7234.05
presumed to be like the Satan force or

7230.239 --> 7237.98
whatever it's very mythologized but yeah

7234.05 --> 7241.91
dragons the only reference that I've

7237.98 --> 7247.19
seen is just on huge skill so Titanic

7241.91 --> 7250.16
sized dragons Titan size tide the

7247.19 --> 7252.259999999999
Titanic is like a duck boat and compared

7250.16 --> 7259.099999999999
to that that dragon so they're like

7252.26 --> 7261.83
they're like the Japanese kaiju so uh

7259.1 --> 7265.160000000001
Godzilla right yeah in that direction

7261.83 --> 7270.04
yes an ancient and an ancient super evil

7265.16 --> 7273.59
ultimate powerful super large giant

7270.04 --> 7276.56
dragon-like creature so there's a a

7273.59 --> 7282.56
black mountain range in what would you

7276.56 --> 7285.02
say Monaco Morocco Morocco yeah that was

7282.56 --> 7287.39
once a dragon is that it now if you look

7285.02 --> 7290.660000000001
at it it really does look like a dragon

7287.39 --> 7294.92
and there's pretty old legends that

7290.66 --> 7297.349999999999
point at that region as well okay okay

7294.92 --> 7298.469
and so that was a that's a really evil

7297.35 --> 7301.229
place is that

7298.469 --> 7304.11
no no no but the creature supposedly

7301.229 --> 7306.780000000001
like is conceptualized within the story

7304.11 --> 7309.239
concept of it like it is

7306.78 --> 7311.88
the original fallen angel basically like

7309.239 --> 7314.909
it is the original form of Satan as he

7311.88 --> 7317.639
came down to earth and started wreaking

7314.909 --> 7319.768999999999
havoc and that was the first form he

7317.639 --> 7322.079
appeared in - and then he was destroyed

7319.769 --> 7325.92
and then out of like his blood or

7322.079 --> 7329.34
something or is I don't know the exact

7325.92 --> 7332.13
details but like other smaller forms

7329.34 --> 7336.269
sprouted up and continued the battle and

7332.13 --> 7338.309
it's super mythologized reminds me a lot

7336.269 --> 7341.639
about the Lord of the Rings The

7338.309 --> 7346.9490000000005
Silmarillion it's that level of mega

7341.639 --> 7355.139
epic surreal but yeah that's this that's

7346.949 --> 7358.079
the story about that oh ok it's not it's

7355.139 --> 7359.999
not a confirmation or anything but if

7358.079 --> 7362.728999999999
you look at the mountain rage even

7359.999 --> 7366.659
through Google Earth Google Maps you'll

7362.729 --> 7369.809
see that does have like like that's not

7366.659 --> 7373.369
even ink-stained level that really looks

7369.809 --> 7373.369000000001
like it this is just weird

7377.47 --> 7403.360000000001
maybe I can find it and show it so I was

7393.64 --> 7406.72
listening to episode what was it 687 686

7403.36 --> 7409.929999999999
on Nathan's channel the other day

7406.72 --> 7413.9400000000005
there's no idea which one that is okay

7409.93 --> 7415.39
what was the one that was on yesterday

7413.94 --> 7417.669999999999
yeah

7415.39 --> 7422.05
I'm looks like James give me a bit of a

7417.67 --> 7424.03
heart on oh yeah it's a mouse he's a

7422.05 --> 7429.91
mouthy thing thinks he can take on a

7424.03 --> 7431.95
snake he's he's an angry man he's an

7429.91 --> 7434.889999999999
angry man also that I think he might

7431.95 --> 7436.63
need some therapy awesome I'm not a

7434.89 --> 7438.9400000000005
minister and something like that I'm not

7436.63 --> 7442.54
even gonna joke about it but he is a

7438.94 --> 7446.86
touch he's and he's a solipsistic near

7442.54 --> 7450.94
list and he's literally religiously not

7446.86 --> 7455.32
using his reasoning capacity and it's

7450.94 --> 7459.58
ridiculous his approach is very autistic

7455.32 --> 7462.639999999999
in my personal view and I just find him

7459.58 --> 7464.38
a disruptive factor and has very little

7462.64 --> 7470.17
to contribute that is not blatantly

7464.38 --> 7472.900000000001
obvious to anyone and yeah look if

7470.17 --> 7474.64
there's certain SSAT to be have some

7472.9 --> 7476.41
kind of societal explanation for

7474.64 --> 7479.530000000001
something I'll be happy to do it as I

7476.41 --> 7481.96
have always done it but to me it's like

7479.53 --> 7487.599999999999
James is pretty much superfluous at this

7481.96 --> 7493.15
point well is the interesting guy I'd

7487.6 --> 7494.59
like to talk to him so you think oh yeah

7493.15 --> 7496.0599999999995
there's a couple of questions I'd like

7494.59 --> 7499.09
to ask him a couple things I like to

7496.06 --> 7501.7300000000005
clarify with him but yeah I might look

7499.09 --> 7504.76
at that Tom I get that chance another

7501.73 --> 7509.179999999999
tom what we try Merrifield maybe I can

7504.76 --> 7511.070000000001
help you out oh well I'm really I mean

7509.18 --> 7512.75
I don't really want to talk about the

7511.07 --> 7513.11
goal he's not here sort of thing you

7512.75 --> 7516.56
know

7513.11 --> 7520.04
oh yeah well he doesn't like that at all

7516.56 --> 7523.13
takes no offense he might soon honor if

7520.04 --> 7525.53
we do that yeah but I just thought he

7523.13 --> 7528.26
was a bit a bit out on he do and it had

7525.53 --> 7530.63
on the other paper so that's all the one

7528.26 --> 7538.76
to say right well I interpreted that

7530.63 --> 7540.62
being hard as being desperate hmm you're

7538.76 --> 7542.93
gonna be desperate when you out right to

7540.62 --> 7546.23
reject reason in the face of a group of

7542.93 --> 7550.09
people that specialize in mastering

7546.23 --> 7554.57
reason so yeah it's it's a totally

7550.09 --> 7560.84
ridiculous setup who specializes in

7554.57 --> 7564.679999999999
mastering reason us me the whole crew on

7560.84 --> 7566.66
Nathan's that's what we focus on that's

7564.68 --> 7574.85
what you focus on Nathan's is is

7566.66 --> 7577.97
reasoning that's right okay what if you

7574.85 --> 7581.06
had to sum it up what would you say it

7577.97 --> 7586.66
is is the sum of what you've mastered in

7581.06 --> 7590.0
with Nathan and I else would you include

7586.66 --> 7593.15
huh I have to give Joan some credit for

7590.0 --> 7597.25
however his characteristics are he did

7593.15 --> 7600.0199999999995
bring a lot of knowledge in Reilly also

7597.25 --> 7601.22
despite all his character flaws has

7600.02 --> 7606.35
helped Lots

7601.22 --> 7609.5
and let's see would you say right your

7606.35 --> 7611.120000000001
eyes like yeah everyone has grown their

7609.5 --> 7612.74
own type of senses in this like

7611.12 --> 7617.48
chocolate saying for example also

7612.74 --> 7619.37
totally get it gets it and yeah all of

7617.48 --> 7622.25
us at Ranchi he's putting a lot of work

7619.37 --> 7624.5599999999995
to hates of work

7622.25 --> 7629.54
yeah Randy Randy does a lot of

7624.56 --> 7631.820000000001
observations so Anthony Riley is another

7629.54 --> 7635.6
of the masters of reason you should call

7631.82 --> 7637.49
yourselves that why we don't need a

7635.6 --> 7638.88
title that it's just our focus that's

7637.49 --> 7641.65
all

7638.88 --> 7645.85
we're trying to actually figure it out

7641.65 --> 7649.12
and build and not just stick to two

7645.85 --> 7650.89
dogmas okay so these figure it out

7649.12 --> 7654.04
that's what we've been doing in the last

7650.89 --> 7656.59
three or four years okay so it's that

7654.04 --> 7660.79
quantum eraser guy and Nathan and you

7656.59 --> 7662.650000000001
and Riley and ranty well those are the

7660.79 --> 7664.84
first ones that come to mind because

7662.65 --> 7667.33
yeah I've been dealing with them a lot

7664.84 --> 7670.45
and I've come to rely upon their

7667.33 --> 7674.23
character and how I know they are so

7670.45 --> 7677.86
yeah the man each one has their own type

7674.23 --> 7680.169999999999
of talent region but they all get it

7677.86 --> 7684.82
they all get what's going on they all

7680.17 --> 7687.01
can differentiate the the fine-tuned

7684.82 --> 7689.259999999999
energies of what's going on and the

7687.01 --> 7691.3
types of reasoning and the mistakes and

7689.26 --> 7696.04
the psychological side effects they all

7691.3 --> 7697.96
get it and they can all explain it in an

7696.04 --> 7701.5
understandable way and that's what makes

7697.96 --> 7704.62
them masters of it masters of the reason

7701.5 --> 7706.36
okay I I could go with that but what's

7704.62 --> 7708.46
happened to rent he's been he hasn't

7706.36 --> 7711.5199999999995
been on in a long time Randy yes well

7708.46 --> 7715.47
his channel has been I don't know

7711.52 --> 7718.780000000001
attacks copyright strict but it seems I

7715.47 --> 7720.97
don't know what's going on I don't I did

7718.78 --> 7724.179999999999
see his videos back up though

7720.97 --> 7725.650000000001
yes okay let me check tonight yeah I

7724.18 --> 7730.66
thought you would know cuz I don't know

7725.65 --> 7732.759999999999
anything about it okay I thought you

7730.66 --> 7735.36
should really look into things more so

7732.76 --> 7738.75
you do know things oh yeah I think

7735.36 --> 7742.69
grantees videos are great resource yes

7738.75 --> 7743.89
yeah not the the the channels just up to

7742.69 --> 7747.669999999999
videos are all there

7743.89 --> 7750.54
last video was Penn the boat and yeah I

7747.67 --> 7753.4
don't know he's probably being busy

7750.54 --> 7758.59
we'll see what happens you'll be back

7753.4 --> 7760.78
I'm certain of it so in your group of

7758.59 --> 7763.18
the Masters of Reason who do you think

7760.78 --> 7766.0
is is the most reasonable the most it

7763.18 --> 7769.37
would be quantum eraser right no

7766.0 --> 7771.56
sure sure he's the one who brings the

7769.37 --> 7774.53
the citations about the scientific

7771.56 --> 7776.75
method is using a lot of data that's

7774.53 --> 7780.83
right but that doesn't make him a master

7776.75 --> 7783.679
of it he's just one of the guys that

7780.83 --> 7786.409
brought it in the first that had an

7783.679 --> 7789.34
initiative of or an important initiative

7786.409 --> 7791.989
to break new grounds for us to deal with

7789.34 --> 7794.03
well he seems to be the one that Nathan

7791.989 --> 7795.61
defers to quite a bit right well that's

7794.03 --> 7798.59
Nathan

7795.61 --> 7801.62
you know I've no one has their own

7798.59 --> 7806.03
personal preferences and choices that

7801.62 --> 7809.48
they make and I make my own and if

7806.03 --> 7811.13
Nathan really likes the guy and yes says

7809.48 --> 7813.62
to whatever he's going to say then

7811.13 --> 7815.78
that's Nathan's choice I'm gonna do

7813.62 --> 7818.09
exactly what I do and I have created a

7815.78 --> 7820.73
citizens of John that I've been

7818.09 --> 7827.54
outspoken about several times since I've

7820.73 --> 7829.759999999999
met him so yeah if Nathan has a certain

7827.54 --> 7831.409
relationship with the guy he likes him

7829.76 --> 7833.26
very much and he'll just let him do

7831.409 --> 7838.009999999999
whatever you want that's Nathan's choice

7833.26 --> 7841.51
I'm gonna do what how I do things when

7838.01 --> 7843.34
it concerns John well sure that's fine

7841.51 --> 7846.4400000000005
hello Chris

7843.34 --> 7850.75
morning good to see you man hey Chris

7846.44 --> 7850.75
hey hey dude

7854.76 --> 7857.659000000001
right

7859.37 --> 7863.94
so anything else Brenda

7861.66 --> 7866.63
no I think I'm gonna head out I'm gonna

7863.94 --> 7869.28
have fixed some coffee I haven't had any

7866.63 --> 7871.29
interesting talking to you you have

7869.28 --> 7871.59
interesting ideas and we'll see you

7871.29 --> 7875.34
later

7871.59 --> 7877.32
okay thankthank a brand oh yeah I just I

7875.34 --> 7879.0
just caught on what was the conversation

7877.32 --> 7881.639999999999
was was Brenda complaining about now

7879.0 --> 7883.86
well not so much she was actually kind

7881.64 --> 7885.780000000001
of interrogating me on my idea and

7883.86 --> 7887.699
everybody's suspecting that she's just

7885.78 --> 7890.429999999999
trying to harvest information to really

7887.699 --> 7894.179999999999
kill me but in retrospect maybe she was

7890.43 --> 7897.12
just honestly listening I don't know

7894.18 --> 7898.1990000000005
Brenda is kind of a weird person well I

7897.12 --> 7899.46
heard you mentioned something about

7898.199 --> 7904.169999999999
Nathan's was she talking about

7899.46 --> 7907.02
oh yeah we were referring to the debates

7904.17 --> 7911.1900000000005
and the debate crew in the sense that I

7907.02 --> 7913.969
made a claim that is that I regard my

7911.19 --> 7917.94
group me Nathan

7913.969 --> 7921.53
Riley ranty John and a couple of others

7917.94 --> 7924.75
and just a whole load of the typical

7921.53 --> 7928.5599999999995
Flat Earth debate panelists that have

7924.75 --> 7930.78
kind of set out on a mission to master

7928.56 --> 7932.969
reason and to really figure out what's

7930.78 --> 7935.58
going on and going everywhere in the

7932.969 --> 7938.31
judicial field in the optics field in

7935.58 --> 7941.13
the philosophical fields in the

7938.31 --> 7943.02
psychological field and really make

7941.13 --> 7945.57
progress and figure it out and I called

7943.02 --> 7947.910000000001
it like the Masters of Reason and she

7945.57 --> 7949.86
took that as some kind of glorious title

7947.91 --> 7952.38
and try to ridicule it a bit and so she

7949.86 --> 7955.349999999999
asked about everyone what do you think

7952.38 --> 7956.91
is the the master is he the leader she

7955.35 --> 7960.120000000001
immediately applied that there should be

7956.91 --> 7961.08
a leader and I just said like no John is

7960.12 --> 7963.18
not the leader

7961.08 --> 7967.14
he's just the one that brought in a lot

7963.18 --> 7969.780000000001
of data very early on and everybody has

7967.14 --> 7972.06
their own opinion about everyone else so

7969.78 --> 7974.67
I don't know she was just trying to

7972.06 --> 7976.320000000001
establish some kind of cult hierarchy or

7974.67 --> 7979.65
something and I didn't give it to her

7976.32 --> 7981.049999999999
because it doesn't exist right I mean

7979.65 --> 7983.339999999999
you can still have you can still have

7981.05 --> 7985.02
someone you call a teacher right and

7983.34 --> 7986.91
John can be a teacher that doesn't mean

7985.02 --> 7989.1
you have to follow everything he says

7986.91 --> 7991.09
right but he can be teaching people

7989.1 --> 7994.09
about scientific method

7991.09 --> 7996.43
or about whatever you want yeah he feels

7994.09 --> 8000.24
he has the best to be in a very

7996.43 --> 8004.4400000000005
authoritarian smartass he's also very

8000.24 --> 8008.4
good at teaching him yes that's his

8004.44 --> 8011.879999999999
personal issue and he noted so sure he's

8008.4 --> 8015.0599999999995
got I mean yeah I agree he's got you

8011.88 --> 8017.82
know he's he's hot you can be hot at

8015.06 --> 8020.55
time on telework yep

8017.82 --> 8025.32
I do enjoy his way of thinking though

8020.55 --> 8027.96
and his is is it his presentations and

8025.32 --> 8030.24
it said his evidence and such right you

8027.96 --> 8032.22
know I've never really heard some of

8030.24 --> 8035.219999999999
that stuff before seeing it presented

8032.22 --> 8038.13
you know that way his I really enjoyed

8035.22 --> 8041.070000000001
his you know I forget what he calls it

8038.13 --> 8043.26
proof of God presentation right fine

8041.07 --> 8044.639999999999
yeah a program of creator and I remember

8043.26 --> 8048.09
what he calls it but yeah I really

8044.64 --> 8051.51
enjoyed that and I like how it uses you

8048.09 --> 8053.37
know science and physics and the real

8051.51 --> 8061.17
call natural world to prove a

8053.37 --> 8065.76
supernatural entity right yeah yeah it's

8061.17 --> 8067.56
fun it's it's it's like delves a bit in

8065.76 --> 8069.72
the philosophical region but it's very

8067.56 --> 8074.52
interesting and he does have good points

8069.72 --> 8077.7300000000005
but yeah it is what it is and I know I

8074.52 --> 8081.240000000001
have no real problem with it as long as

8077.73 --> 8083.49
I can do what I do and maneuver in

8081.24 --> 8087.69
regions that nobody else have thought of

8083.49 --> 8092.28
a person could maneuver in mentally like

8087.69 --> 8097.41
not accepting lights and to be photonic

8092.28 --> 8101.7
indivisible units nobody expects the are

8097.41 --> 8104.22
windy and Inquisition yeah so I didn't

8101.7 --> 8106.5599999999995
catch he did a ball busters the other

8104.22 --> 8110.13
day about I don't know if we could pose

8106.56 --> 8112.92
the quantum mechanics or want them

8110.13 --> 8115.83
whatever but I caught some of it it was

8112.92 --> 8118.35
a little bit piecemeal I felt so I

8115.83 --> 8120.12
didn't catch it there all of it I might

8118.35 --> 8124.17
need you but yeah you're qualified only

8120.12 --> 8125.75
missed my questions I really

8124.17 --> 8128.9400000000005
put him on the spot at a certain point

8125.75 --> 8130.89
yeah did you miss did you see that part

8128.94 --> 8132.719999999999
no I know I didn't I might have to go to

8130.89 --> 8136.25
that is that towards the end no no it's

8132.72 --> 8138.66
actually more into the first half I

8136.25 --> 8142.01
basically when the presentation stopped

8138.66 --> 8144.57
I was already away from the keyboard so

8142.01 --> 8145.89
okay yeah it was weird because that and

8144.57 --> 8147.42
honestly I may have only gone through 10

8145.89 --> 8149.04
or 15 minutes but if I felt like there

8147.42 --> 8151.59
was a video that they were playing at

8149.04 --> 8152.19
first like a presentation John hid in

8151.59 --> 8154.14
the past

8152.19 --> 8157.19
yeah even kind of the sound went wrong

8154.14 --> 8160.17
it just ya know it had a few minutes and

8157.19 --> 8164.61
it'll start normally they had a bit of a

8160.17 --> 8166.02
technical issue right so I have to check

8164.61 --> 8168.299999999999
that out but I mean that's I mean

8166.02 --> 8170.280000000001
honestly that's that's a topic that for

8168.3 --> 8173.64
better or worse I've just not interested

8170.28 --> 8175.65
in really at least not yet and I don't

8173.64 --> 8177.72
know is that something that John what's

8175.65 --> 8179.28
John's point because he's so I feel like

8177.72 --> 8182.490000000001
he's not talking about something unless

8179.28 --> 8183.96
it's relating to flatter or creator or

8182.49 --> 8187.53
something so is he saying that these

8183.96 --> 8189.9
quantum mechanical experiments is this a

8187.53 --> 8192.51
proof of a flat earth or creator no no

8189.9 --> 8194.789999999999
no this was a technical issue basically

8192.51 --> 8196.92
the entire presentation was about one

8194.79 --> 8200.52
thing alone and I kind of helped in my

8196.92 --> 8202.74
own or winning way and that is that

8200.52 --> 8205.68
about the double-slit experiment about

8202.74 --> 8209.28
the misconception that light is a wave

8205.68 --> 8212.94
just because in this experiment the

8209.28 --> 8216.12
results yield a wave-like interference

8212.94 --> 8217.74
pattern and then yeah the rest of it was

8216.12 --> 8219.631000000001
pretty much explaining why it is not

8217.74 --> 8221.94
actually a way if it's just an apparent

8219.631 --> 8223.98
wave and reasons before that and then I

8221.94 --> 8227.881000000001
broke in said like oh yeah but is it

8223.98 --> 8230.85
it's not a particle and did my thing so

8227.881 --> 8234.689999999999
but it's basically about okay light is

8230.85 --> 8237.45
not a wave the interference pattern has

8234.69 --> 8240.99
where is a wave-like pattern but you

8237.45 --> 8242.631000000001
can't then deduce from that that light

8240.99 --> 8246.32
must be a wave that's also

8242.631 --> 8246.32
presuppositional error basically

8248.48 --> 8254.73
hey yeah what is it right now formal

8251.94 --> 8257.099
logical yeah see yeah I mean see it's

8254.73 --> 8260.49
just that hole and lights away bits of

8257.099 --> 8262.41
particle this that I got to me just for

8260.49 --> 8265.34
me personally just bores me to tears not

8262.41 --> 8272.07
really oh yeah I find it absolutely

8265.34 --> 8275.25
delicious and I'm glad that I get it so

8272.07 --> 8277.949999999999
much better than I did like 10 years ago

8275.25 --> 8280.5
the details of us much more fine-tuned

8277.95 --> 8282.150000000001
feeling for the actual details instead

8280.5 --> 8284.639
of just the oversight of what it's

8282.15 --> 8286.17
supposed to be meaning I really like

8284.639 --> 8290.13
working it but that's just me I have

8286.17 --> 8297.719000000001
this weird thing with physics just keeps

8290.13 --> 8298.289999999999
me fascinated yeah but yeah I do check

8297.719 --> 8301.439999999999
it out

8298.29 --> 8307.980000000001
the ball busters it was good

8301.44 --> 8312.929
I um I went on non-sex show the other

8307.98 --> 8315.63
night what's non-sequitur yeah oh okay

8312.929 --> 8319.889
heavy yeah well they were so so Nathan

8315.63 --> 8321.869999999999
Thompson was supposed to be on and he

8319.889 --> 8323.189999999999
had he was late or something so they

8321.87 --> 8326.880000000001
were looking for another flat earther

8323.19 --> 8329.849
and somebody somebody sent them to come

8326.88 --> 8331.018999999998
on and they didn't like staying we don't

8329.849 --> 8332.19
have any fighters gonna come you know

8331.019 --> 8334.95
that were willing to come on they're all

8332.19 --> 8336.99
scared kind of a thing so I'm not scared

8334.95 --> 8338.820000000002
so I'll I'll go on so I shot him my

8336.99 --> 8341.76
email mate and they gave me the link I

8338.82 --> 8343.139
jumped on and it was it was Kyle the

8341.76 --> 8345.66
main I guess he's at the main one the

8343.139 --> 8349.23
main host and then got my name godless

8345.66 --> 8350.67
engineer and I basically debated with

8349.23 --> 8352.559
godless engineer who really we really

8350.67 --> 8353.07
just were having a discussion it went

8352.559 --> 8356.73
pretty well

8353.07 --> 8360.019
I was really calm and you know they

8356.73 --> 8364.23
asked some questions we talked about um

8360.019 --> 8365.34
we talked about you know water that you

8364.23 --> 8366.57
know they of course they always ask you

8365.34 --> 8368.099
order you know what's your proof or

8366.57 --> 8370.769
evidence of Flat Earth I said well one

8368.099 --> 8372.960000000001
of them is water always seeks its look

8370.769 --> 8375.210000000001
to maintain its level and then of course

8372.96 --> 8377.098999999998
they go in about gravity and well you

8375.21 --> 8379.859999999999
know we know it's we know it's curves

8377.099 --> 8381.24
around a ball blah blah blah and we got

8379.86 --> 8382.650000000001
into hee

8381.24 --> 8384.869999999999
godless engineers for the brought up

8382.65 --> 8387.63
both going over the curve and I said

8384.87 --> 8389.400000000001
well I know it's possible that there's a

8387.63 --> 8391.41
different cost for what appears to be a

8389.4 --> 8392.85
vocal over a curve right I'm glad into

8391.41 --> 8394.17
her because and then he said well if

8392.85 --> 8395.91
that's true then what's what's the

8394.17 --> 8398.07
phenomenon and you know why does it

8395.91 --> 8399.9
disappear from the bottom up and I said

8398.07 --> 8402.27
well that ideally does I go it appears

8399.9 --> 8405.21
to disappear from the bottom I said it's

8402.27 --> 8406.140000000001
mostly due to refraction you know talked

8405.21 --> 8408.72
about the mirror band

8406.14 --> 8411.0
Travis likes to talk about just yeah you

8408.72 --> 8413.31
should say optics in general because

8411.0 --> 8415.68
that's what they just completely take

8413.31 --> 8418.979
out of the picture every time they do

8415.68 --> 8420.479000000001
their ball calculations sure yeah I mean

8418.979 --> 8422.55
well I can't I couldn't just say optic

8420.479 --> 8424.59
but it ear I his optics it's an optical

8422.55 --> 8427.08
phenomenon due to due to refraction and

8424.59 --> 8430.5
then godless engineer I mean he really

8427.08 --> 8432.3
didn't do a very good job um he he asked

8430.5 --> 8434.16
he made a lot of incorrect statements

8432.3 --> 8435.479
like he said he said refraction is

8434.16 --> 8438.06
caused by a curved brick by light

8435.479 --> 8439.92
bending over the curve yeah right yeah

8438.06 --> 8441.81
and I said no i said restaurant

8439.92 --> 8443.24
refraction that's ridiculous that's

8441.81 --> 8445.83
right and i said well how does

8443.24 --> 8447.449999999999
refraction happen on a flat road in the

8445.83 --> 8449.37
desert right I mean so obviously it's

8447.45 --> 8451.5
not caught I said it's not caused by the

8449.37 --> 8453.570000000002
curve I said all refraction is is like

8451.5 --> 8454.89
light going through a particular medium

8453.57 --> 8456.57
whether that's air or water or whatever

8454.89 --> 8458.88
you're gonna have different refractive

8456.57 --> 8460.05
properties and so he had to he basically

8458.88 --> 8462.439999999999
had to conceive that I mean he had to

8460.05 --> 8465.15
concede a couple points to be honest

8462.44 --> 8467.310000000001
yeah and so and honestly I was only on

8465.15 --> 8469.59
for maybe fifteen or twenty minutes

8467.31 --> 8471.33
because then Nathan Thompson came on and

8469.59 --> 8473.27
he kind of they kind of went with the

8471.33 --> 8477.63
original schedule program which is fine

8473.27 --> 8479.729000000001
but I got a lot of good feedback from

8477.63 --> 8482.64
some of the haut they I don't know the

8479.729 --> 8483.72
guys on the show just saying the one guy

8482.64 --> 8485.31
said he doesn't agree with me but he

8483.72 --> 8488.66
respects me he felt I really handle

8485.31 --> 8491.1
myself well and you know I wasn't

8488.66 --> 8492.81
argumentative I was I didn't cuz I

8491.1 --> 8495.06
wasn't loud I just sort of stated my

8492.81 --> 8497.729
case and because you know what they like

8495.06 --> 8499.5
to do is they'll ask questions and and

8497.729 --> 8501.39
honestly if you if you give them an

8499.5 --> 8502.92
answer they'll listen to the answer now

8501.39 --> 8505.439999999999
they might have a comeback for it later

8502.92 --> 8509.07
that they let me talk and I was able to

8505.44 --> 8511.44
describe you know a couple of things the

8509.07 --> 8512.55
refraction as the boat goes in you know

8511.44 --> 8514.62
goes farther the refraction zone

8512.55 --> 8514.96
actually gets larger and then not only

8514.62 --> 8518.229000000001
that

8514.96 --> 8520.06
you know the atmosphere tends to block

8518.229 --> 8521.59
things know start to block things at the

8520.06 --> 8523.33
top few so it appears like the boats

8521.59 --> 8527.68
disappeared but really it's just gone

8523.33 --> 8529.12
into the atmosphere but it was fun and

8527.68 --> 8531.31
they asked me if I wanted to come back

8529.12 --> 8534.01
sometime I said I said I would now it's

8531.31 --> 8535.96
hard with my schedule I mean far as

8534.01 --> 8537.64
having like the kids it's kind of hard

8535.96 --> 8540.099999999999
but I said I would come back on and they

8537.64 --> 8542.65
seem to they seem to want me to come

8540.1 --> 8548.77
back on which is pretty cool yeah nice

8542.65 --> 8553.539999999999
nice I'm glad to hear that you managed

8548.77 --> 8556.060000000001
to keep your ground basically and it's

8553.54 --> 8558.61
interesting it like maybe you know what

8556.06 --> 8560.619999999999
maybe the ballers are realizing how much

8558.61 --> 8564.28
they actually need a flat earther to be

8560.62 --> 8566.5
part of their show so they're like maybe

8564.28 --> 8568.810000000001
doing a lid being a little bit more

8566.5 --> 8573.18
gentle now with people well surf it

8568.81 --> 8577.84
because you're a fan delight guy yeah

8573.18 --> 8579.94
yeah I mean starting around but I you're

8577.84 --> 8582.16
right and you're wrong in that so when I

8579.94 --> 8583.78
was on they were pretty polite because I

8582.16 --> 8585.85
was pretty polite and I think if you

8583.78 --> 8588.550000000001
keep it in that manner in that tone sort

8585.85 --> 8590.17
of a calm tone talking about just the

8588.55 --> 8592.539999999999
facts right and the facts of the matter

8590.17 --> 8594.729
they seem to be pretty calm now

8592.54 --> 8596.29
this godless engineer guy he's I said

8594.729 --> 8598.779999999999
something at one point I don't remember

8596.29 --> 8601.630000000001
what and he said that's [Â __Â ] and I

8598.78 --> 8603.460000000001
said I go please don't don't you know

8601.63 --> 8605.349999999999
get like that I said if you think it's

8603.46 --> 8606.88
[Â __Â ] that's fine I said but you got

8605.35 --> 8608.92
to explain why cuz he just said that's

8606.88 --> 8610.479
[Â __Â ] and kind of went on so I called

8608.92 --> 8612.31
him out for that and he didn't really do

8610.479 --> 8614.17
that again

8612.31 --> 8615.82
but then Nathan Thomson came on and ate

8614.17 --> 8617.229
now see Nathan Thompson was pretty much

8615.82 --> 8618.31
to get screaming and yelling at them the

8617.229 --> 8620.05
whole time so they were screaming and

8618.31 --> 8621.85
yelling back so you're right it does

8620.05 --> 8623.65
seem to be if you have a cool calm

8621.85 --> 8628.56
demeanor they'll probably be that way to

8623.65 --> 8634.39
you rights because then then they can't

8628.56 --> 8636.91
use and your anger to just outrageously

8634.39 --> 8639.64
respond and kick you because if they're

8636.91 --> 8642.28
gonna start out being outrageous and

8639.64 --> 8644.17
anger which they have will feel in

8642.28 --> 8646.45
response to actual flat earth arguments

8644.17 --> 8647.73
and you're perfectly calm they will look

8646.45 --> 8650.551000000001
very bad from

8647.73 --> 8654.211
every angle so that's why they basically

8650.551 --> 8656.039999999999
have to stay calm and they're like many

8654.211 --> 8658.949999999999
of these ballers did the more nasty ones

8656.04 --> 8660.480000000001
they just wait for they just tried to

8658.95 --> 8663.33
trigger flat earth that's why they

8660.48 --> 8665.789999999999
always like put the little couple of

8663.33 --> 8668.49
pokes of ridicule and just generalizing

8665.79 --> 8671.551000000001
flat or stupidity always always have to

8668.49 --> 8672.539999999999
talk about it somehow in the presence of

8671.551 --> 8675.421
a flat earther

8672.54 --> 8676.921
just to piss you off because that's what

8675.421 --> 8681.091
they want because when you get pissed

8676.921 --> 8684.78
off the year they can just use you in

8681.091 --> 8686.79
any kind of context very easily without

8684.78 --> 8688.5
them looking bad over it but if you're

8686.79 --> 8690.931
going to be perfectly calm and

8688.5 --> 8693.87
untouchable then they they actually have

8690.931 --> 8699.33
to do some real work then because they

8693.87 --> 8707.341
can't use their easy tricks right so

8699.33 --> 8708.721
yeah well done it's tough and I think

8707.341 --> 8710.61
it's one of those things where when they

8708.721 --> 8712.609999999999
ask you what your proofs are think I

8710.61 --> 8716.25
think if you keep it to proofs that

8712.61 --> 8719.400000000001
either either they can't explain through

8716.25 --> 8721.65
experimentation or you definitely know

8719.4 --> 8723.15
there's a different cause you know I

8721.65 --> 8724.98
think that's part of the key so when I

8723.15 --> 8727.109999999999
talk about waters always ceases level

8724.98 --> 8729.301
well they can't deny that right I mean

8727.11 --> 8731.431
maybe they can but they have to go off

8729.301 --> 8732.961
based off conjecture and that conjecture

8731.431 --> 8734.91
is gravity wrapping water around the

8732.961 --> 8736.74
ball right and my whole point is you

8734.91 --> 8738.591
can't prove that there's no experiments

8736.74 --> 8741.811
prove that you'd have to have something

8738.591 --> 8743.221
greater than a mile say a mile right

8741.811 --> 8745.561
because in after a mile you're curbing

8743.221 --> 8747.301
at some point eight inches so larger

8745.561 --> 8749.119999999999
than a mile and you know do all these

8747.301 --> 8753.33
things that would be almost impossible

8749.12 --> 8755.28
um so my but that was just my thing and

8753.33 --> 8757.23
I said I said you know I just intense

8755.28 --> 8759.24
with water I said I put water and Bowl

8757.23 --> 8761.07
and a cup in a jar and a vase and they

8759.24 --> 8762.69
kind of laughed at that you know and I'm

8761.07 --> 8765.181
like well but let see my test showed

8762.69 --> 8767.101
that it always seeks level and I go

8765.181 --> 8769.2
pitch and you all don't have any tests

8767.101 --> 8771.03
or experiments showing otherwise right

8769.2 --> 8772.980000000001
see it's all theory it's all it's all

8771.03 --> 8776.761
conjecture and they don't want because

8772.98 --> 8779.079
it is true level is are based level in

8776.761 --> 8784.069000000001
their view

8779.079 --> 8787.128999999999
right my three three that I go to our

8784.069 --> 8790.458999999999
waters flat and level you can see things

8787.129 --> 8791.689
too far or ships going I like ships

8790.459 --> 8793.159000000001
going over the horizon because any

8791.689 --> 8797.81
pretty much any video that they'll fail

8793.159 --> 8800.989
that they can use I can I can debunk or

8797.81 --> 8805.34
I can I can show the atmosphere and

8800.989 --> 8808.31
refraction and Marashi and then gas

8805.34 --> 8812.419
pressure next to vacuum those are my

8808.31 --> 8815.028999999999
three goatees yeah well there's those

8812.419 --> 8821.149
are some real go twos especially the gas

8815.029 --> 8822.85
pressure things it's stuff yeah now get

8821.149 --> 8825.858999999999
and so gas pressure is a good one

8822.85 --> 8827.300000000001
right so so there's a couple there's a

8825.859 --> 8829.999
couple comebacks the gas pressure right

8827.3 --> 8833.329
one comeback it is gas pressure gradient

8829.999 --> 8835.249
which we can now explain the what I

8833.329 --> 8837.649
should what I did on Nathan show the

8835.249 --> 8840.199
other day which is air temperature

8837.649 --> 8842.118999999999
variance right so with with hotter

8840.199 --> 8843.439
temperature you have you have more gas

8842.119 --> 8844.699
pressure and with lower temperature you

8843.439 --> 8846.35
have less and that makes complete sense

8844.699 --> 8847.729000000001
on the earth because you have higher

8846.35 --> 8850.879
typically higher temperature at the

8847.729 --> 8853.128999999999
bottom colder temperature at the top so

8850.879 --> 8854.93
that makes sense so that sort of those

8853.129 --> 8856.34
away with gas pressure gradient and then

8854.93 --> 8858.35
the other comeback is well but we have

8856.34 --> 8859.609
you know it's not a violation of the

8858.35 --> 8861.709
second law if you have a force acting

8859.609 --> 8862.609
line and that force is gravity so

8861.709 --> 8864.439
there's a couple there's a couple

8862.609 --> 8866.09
comebacks to that the first is gravity

8864.439 --> 8867.59
is what's called a pseudo or fictitious

8866.09 --> 8869.6
force according to Einstein so it's not

8867.59 --> 8870.919
even a real force and then if they

8869.6 --> 8873.229000000001
happen if they say anything about that

8870.919 --> 8874.97
right you can then go to some sort of

8873.229 --> 8878.179999999998
experimentation so okay well then show

8874.97 --> 8881.778999999999
me gravity causing garage pressure at

8878.18 --> 8884.749
surface via if you put so in other words

8881.779 --> 8886.819000000001
he put a container a pressurized

8884.749 --> 8890.39
container next to a vacuum and you open

8886.819 --> 8891.859
the container will gravity prevent the

8890.39 --> 8894.59
gas from going into the gap in the

8891.859 --> 8897.619
vacuum the answer is obviously no no so

8894.59 --> 8899.749
the motion will do or pre presume to do

8897.619 --> 8901.699
is cause a gradient once the gas

8899.749 --> 8909.449999999999
pressure has found its equilibrium in

8901.699 --> 8914.2
the new container right oh boy

8909.45 --> 8915.79
hello sorry oh and I was just wondering

8914.2 --> 8920.77
if I could just pipe on here with the

8915.79 --> 8924.54
pressure gradient thing attire gonna

8920.77 --> 8924.54
compare attire to the atmosphere jazz

8924.6 --> 8928.93
sorry go on

8926.02 --> 8932.560000000001
fairies I don't know des view assign

8928.93 --> 8937.27
attire to the atmosphere you're going to

8932.56 --> 8940.75
compare a tire a bicycle tire to the gas

8937.27 --> 8944.050000000001
in the atmosphere is that right okay so

8940.75 --> 8947.069
if you are comparing a tire you're

8944.05 --> 8951.58
saying you'd them no no no yes you are

8947.069 --> 8954.31
no no so that the pressure at the

8951.58 --> 8959.41
surface of the earth is the same as it

8954.31 --> 8962.26
as sixty thousand Peters oh no sorry

8959.41 --> 8966.58
just what we saw what was your will to

8962.26 --> 8968.109
join a charming with our we don't have a

8966.58 --> 8971.609
guest pressure on earth we have a

8968.109 --> 8975.130000000001
pressure gradient and is for Tricia

8971.609 --> 8977.710000000001
so at sea level a standard atmospheric

8975.13 --> 8978.46
pressure is a thousand and thirteen hit

8977.71 --> 8984.759999999998
the Pascal's

8978.46 --> 8986.938999999998
at sea level that's right no atmospheric

8984.76 --> 8989.979
pressures tightness of gas pressure

8986.939 --> 8991.42
that's averaged out so it seemed you

8989.979 --> 8993.97
know on an average day

8991.42 --> 8998.34
it's a thousand and thirteen heat to

8993.97 --> 9001.41
Pascal's at plus fifteen degrees Celsius

8998.34 --> 9006.12
every thousand every thousand feet you

9001.41 --> 9008.789999999999
go up your decrees lose it decreases by

9006.12 --> 9014.189
thirty hit de pesca I know you know what

9008.79 --> 9018.990000000002
Buono gas pressure gradient so r1 do you

9014.189 --> 9023.27
know why Kristin I went in Chris you do

9018.99 --> 9027.149
your math on your calculator and divide

9023.27 --> 9029.34
every thousand feet you go up by 30 and

9027.149 --> 9033.75
hit the Pascal's at B that's it equator

9029.34 --> 9036.39
and you can see where there's zero hit

9033.75 --> 9040.38
to pass course that's where spaces no

9036.39 --> 9042.439999999999
there's no point like that it is now

9040.38 --> 9044.15
that's what

9042.44 --> 9046.971000000001
there's after a certain height there's

9044.15 --> 9049.58
false data provided by NASA was purely

9046.971 --> 9052.520999999999
fictional because I use it's nothing

9049.58 --> 9056.091
it's gonna decrease and it come with

9052.521 --> 9058.79
Italy dropping rate it's gonna decrease

9056.091 --> 9062.12
less and less the further higher up you

9058.79 --> 9065.480000000001
go it decreases listen less the further

9062.12 --> 9068.54
yeah no for south latitude you go that's

9065.48 --> 9073.850999999999
why the spice is lower at the North and

9068.54 --> 9075.62
South Pole what but what the hell are

9073.851 --> 9077.271
you talking about what does latitude

9075.62 --> 9081.7
have to do with this we're talking about

9077.271 --> 9085.150000000001
height we're talking about white Arwen

9081.7 --> 9088.58
what is latitude have to do with Heights

9085.15 --> 9091.520999999999
those are a horizontal so presuppose

9088.58 --> 9094.19
coordinates of the earth based actually

9091.521 --> 9097.49
based on a presupposition no yeah based

9094.19 --> 9100.61
on the celestial scales or that so it's

9097.49 --> 9103.789999999999
nothing to do with verticality actually

9100.61 --> 9110.41
now who doesn't forget that forget I

9103.79 --> 9113.631000000001
even spoke about that okay right so

9110.41 --> 9116.66
anyway the gas pressure gradient on the

9113.631 --> 9119.48
earth is very real and gas pressure

9116.66 --> 9122.931
gradients can definitely be proven to be

9119.48 --> 9127.16
forming naturally with your containers

9122.931 --> 9130.28
on several skills it's a natural for now

9127.16 --> 9132.74
is something that happens naturally not

9130.28 --> 9134.841
only once gas pressure has found its

9132.74 --> 9138.08
equilibrium within that container and

9134.841 --> 9141.471
then the gradient will start to form if

9138.08 --> 9144.289999999999
there yeah if there is no what types of

9141.471 --> 9148.100999999999
pressures don't enough room flow stop

9144.29 --> 9150.171
interrupting me and now I'm done now you

9148.101 --> 9151.671
can talk don't be an ass stop

9150.171 --> 9152.681
interrupting me in the middle of an

9151.671 --> 9160.33
explanation

9152.681 --> 9160.33
now go you're talking about gas pressure

9160.66 --> 9169.641
on air earth do you know what a

9163.7 --> 9176.171
compressor is do you know what

9169.641 --> 9176.171
Capricia per square inch means psi yeah

9176.58 --> 9182.5
yeah I do okay

9179.95 --> 9184.36
so if there's a thousand and thirteen

9182.5 --> 9186.49
hit the Pascal's of pressure on the

9184.36 --> 9188.380000000001
surface of the earth then they should be

9186.49 --> 9192.19
the same at the top of the dome

9188.38 --> 9196.65
shouldn't there no how do you get there

9192.19 --> 9201.07
because it's not the only factor just

9196.65 --> 9203.35
because that is just one part of the

9201.07 --> 9206.38
entire things the spectrum of things

9203.35 --> 9209.01
happening on this world it's just one

9206.38 --> 9211.869999999999
element of it very powerful elemental

9209.01 --> 9214.15
the need for gas pressure to find an

9211.87 --> 9216.970000000001
equilibrium within the container based

9214.15 --> 9222.25
on psi natural psi pressuring against

9216.97 --> 9223.24
something psi its pressure per square

9222.25 --> 9227.41
inch

9223.24 --> 9231.34
yeah on what so it's a question pressing

9227.41 --> 9236.771
on and a compressor you've got a steel

9231.34 --> 9243.12
box that the pressure is equal on every

9236.771 --> 9243.12
surface of that box or that chamber yeah

9243.66 --> 9251.71
so that's not the earth no it's it's a

9248.47 --> 9254.65
compressor that's why airliners are

9251.71 --> 9256.929999999998
pressurized to fly at 30,000 feet when

9254.65 --> 9260.5
they have a pressurized cabin of 8,000

9256.93 --> 9262.45
feet when the air so thin they can fly

9260.5 --> 9266.64
faster because the air molecules are

9262.45 --> 9268.75
thinner that's how they can fly faster

9266.64 --> 9270.359999999999
but why are they thinner though that's

9268.75 --> 9273.49
the question you're not answering

9270.36 --> 9279.61
because I just seed every thousand feet

9273.49 --> 9281.68
you go up yeah the pressure pickles in

9279.61 --> 9284.01
the southern hemisphere or inches of

9281.68 --> 9286.54
mercury in the northern hemisphere and

9284.01 --> 9288.521
hit de pesca was on another southern

9286.54 --> 9291.85
hemisphere and hit the Pascal's they

9288.521 --> 9296.01
decreased by 30 hit to Pascal's by 30 by

9291.85 --> 9299.56
every stairs and feet you go up but why

9296.01 --> 9302.35
but why yeah you're just you're just

9299.56 --> 9303.09
saying numbers why does it go why does

9302.35 --> 9306.461000000001
it decrease

9303.09 --> 9307.961
I'm just saying numbers

9306.461 --> 9310.541
yeah this is nice there's a pressure

9307.961 --> 9313.721
gradient we get it there's a pressure

9310.541 --> 9316.541
gradient it's there because we measure

9313.721 --> 9319.449999999999
it there's a pressure gradient are you

9316.541 --> 9321.911
gonna get to any point soon oh and I am

9319.45 --> 9325.211000000001
when you can you've just acknowledged

9321.911 --> 9327.311
there's a pressure gradient so what why

9325.211 --> 9330.251
is there pressure gradient I'll look

9327.311 --> 9332.831
I'll explain to Chris how this happens

9330.251 --> 9335.98
with wisdom there's a pressure gradient

9332.831 --> 9339.07
you just said there was what you just

9335.98 --> 9343.029999999999
have but do you know what a pressure

9339.07 --> 9346.029999999999
gradient means yeah it means there's a

9343.03 --> 9349.331
pressure gradient the atmosphere fades

9346.03 --> 9353.021
into space right yes exactly

9349.331 --> 9357.461
so yeah doesn't mean at all okay so how

9353.021 --> 9361.150000000001
the Freak do you guys think that the

9357.461 --> 9365.051
atmosphere gets spun into space because

9361.15 --> 9368.291
if it would be an open space then it

9365.051 --> 9370.331
must be spun in open space because the

9368.291 --> 9374.23
gas pressure that psi doesn't have

9370.331 --> 9376.69
anything to press upon up there right so

9374.23 --> 9379.57
it can never form that equilibrium in

9376.69 --> 9382.15
order to form a gas pressure gradient

9379.57 --> 9384.851
system within the container it will just

9382.15 --> 9387.251
flip out of there shoot off in space

9384.851 --> 9390.311
because there's no starting point

9387.251 --> 9392.501
there's no container to press against

9390.311 --> 9397.020999999999
and form that equilibrium so that a

9392.501 --> 9397.021
gradient may come into being that's why

9400.771 --> 9407.051000000001
there is another very obvious reason but

9403.751 --> 9409.091
sorry Chris what was your question about

9407.051 --> 9410.501
the pressure gradient I'm saying why

9409.091 --> 9415.091
does it decrease as you increase

9410.501 --> 9418.631
altitude well it's the same as are you

9415.091 --> 9420.641
it I'm not a diver but a you a diver

9418.631 --> 9423.911
it's not it's not rocket science it's

9420.641 --> 9428.020999999999
not the same as water because gas and

9423.911 --> 9430.301
water are not the same now they consider

9428.021 --> 9431.980000000001
the same so I know they're both

9430.301 --> 9434.291
considered fluids the water is not but

9431.98 --> 9437.23
fluid is not a gas our water is not a

9434.291 --> 9440.91
gas rather okay but would you

9437.23 --> 9444.76
acknowledge that that water has weight

9440.91 --> 9448.15
yeah water has wait okay say have you

9444.76 --> 9454.62
heard of a datum you know what a datum

9448.15 --> 9459.1
is why you explained it

9454.62 --> 9460.93
that's us a datum as we use it in

9459.1 --> 9464.050000000001
aviation all the time

9460.93 --> 9467.14
loading airplanes for weight and balance

9464.05 --> 9472.929999999998
a datum as a single point above the

9467.14 --> 9474.55
earth and it's pretty much a single

9472.93 --> 9476.979000000001
shaft from the top of the atmosphere

9474.55 --> 9478.63
right down three head down through your

9476.979 --> 9485.05
feet down through to this end of the

9478.63 --> 9489.339999999998
earth it's a cylinder as wide as you

9485.05 --> 9497.32
that goes straight from up upstairs to

9489.34 --> 9499.66
downstairs obviously I don't I I have to

9497.32 --> 9501.699999999999
go I get on a work call I have no idea

9499.66 --> 9503.289999999999
what this has to do with anything the

9501.7 --> 9504.689
reason there's a gas pressure gradient

9503.29 --> 9507.01
and why as you increase altitude

9504.689 --> 9509.14
pressure decreases is because the

9507.01 --> 9510.64
temperature decreases it's really that

9509.14 --> 9512.769999999999
simple you can feel free to google it

9510.64 --> 9515.65
and do some research I got to go on

9512.77 --> 9516.34
I know you can't handle it doesn't make

9515.65 --> 9517.93
sense

9516.34 --> 9520.42
that does kind of make sense in the

9517.93 --> 9523.630000000001
consistent grade oh that's a good point

9520.42 --> 9526.18
Chris thanks for joining hmm the air is

9523.63 --> 9530.08
cooler the further you go away from the

9526.18 --> 9533.32
earth close to the earth you well that

9530.08 --> 9536.17
would definitely decrease the typical

9533.32 --> 9541.57
pressure pressure of gas pressure of gas

9536.17 --> 9545.47
tends to be more yeah pushing when it's

9541.57 --> 9548.68
warmer it all pushy yeah it's more pushy

9545.47 --> 9551.949999999999
it pressure increases of gas when you

9548.68 --> 9554.74
heat it up generally no I want I want

9551.95 --> 9557.5
you obviously not accompany your videos

9554.74 --> 9559.33
that you've you claim to have spoken to

9557.5 --> 9564.15
some pilots would you mind remain in

9559.33 --> 9564.15
contact with them I did

9565.369 --> 9572.01
well I've had pilots joining debates and

9570.149 --> 9574.89
everything I didn't know them person I

9572.01 --> 9580.169
don't know any pilots personally not

9574.89 --> 9581.999
that I would seek contact with anyway in

9580.169 --> 9584.329
any and you'd be able to put me in

9581.999 --> 9587.43
contact with them No

9584.329 --> 9590.279
why not no I'm not I'm not gonna seek

9587.43 --> 9594.239
contact with them so I'm not gonna both

9590.279 --> 9596.249
give you contact seed that's know I'm a

9594.239 --> 9599.01
fellow pilot why the [Â __Â ] would you not

9596.249 --> 9602.628999999999
put me in contact with them because I

9599.01 --> 9602.629
don't want any contact with him

9603.799 --> 9608.819000000001
well tell you why you don't want any

9606.749 --> 9610.708999999999
contact with them because you don't know

9608.819 --> 9612.93
why you don't even know who I'm talking

9610.709 --> 9615.149000000001
about you have no clue why not no I

9612.93 --> 9619.169
don't personally reason it has nothing

9615.149 --> 9621.659
to do with this argument I can size it

9619.169 --> 9624.06
down the pilot I really know personally

9621.659 --> 9626.279
and I don't know any other pilots

9624.06 --> 9628.589
personally although you know what one of

9626.279 --> 9632.489
my uncle's I think is like a flight

9628.589 --> 9634.999
instructor a public flight instructor so

9632.489 --> 9636.689
he oh I'd love to have a chat with them

9634.999 --> 9641.1
sure you do

9636.689 --> 9643.229000000001
I don't think it's mutual though I mean

9641.1 --> 9644.52
I think he's a very good English speaker

9643.229 --> 9648.659
and I don't think he would have the

9644.52 --> 9651.449
patience for somebody like you what

9648.659 --> 9653.458999999999
somebody that sign now somebody that's

9651.449 --> 9658.529
constantly drunk and slobbering and he

9653.459 --> 9660.689
barely has a point to make sorry you've

9658.529 --> 9663.689
got tolerance but I'm not gonna subject

9660.689 --> 9670.970000000001
my own uncle to somebody like you for no

9663.689 --> 9675.979000000001
reason you've got some really bad points

9670.97 --> 9675.979
yeah you do you have terrible points

9676.22 --> 9684.489
we're acting like a [Â __Â ] child right

9679.439 --> 9687.069
like this that's your exit sign goodbye

9684.489 --> 9692.198999999999
you don't talk to me like that very

9687.069 --> 9699.399
simple and I am gonna round out the show

9692.199 --> 9701.229000000001
anyway so uh yeah does mix own yeah

9699.399 --> 9701.769999999999
thanks for being on the panel it was

9701.229 --> 9705.489
good

9701.77 --> 9709.149000000001
it's cool man hey yeah thanks Rhys for

9705.489 --> 9711.698999999999
being here as well yeah just I hope to

9709.149 --> 9712.149
see you around some more in the near

9711.699 --> 9714.970000000001
future

9712.149 --> 9717.58
yeah I'll get all this pecking sorted

9714.97 --> 9720.039999999999
and then once my move I'll be I'll be

9717.58 --> 9725.34
more back to streamlined routine again

9720.04 --> 9730.51
you know all right well thanks guys

9725.34 --> 9732.67
interesting panel Lee yeah back and

9730.51 --> 9736.18
forth but yeah I just got in silly and

9732.67 --> 9738.64
yeah if you're gonna like swear at the

9736.18 --> 9740.439
hosts like that that's especially such a

9738.64 --> 9741.88
moment like that this is just and I

9740.439 --> 9745.960000000001
wanted to round out the show anyway so

9741.88 --> 9748.39
my patience was running thin yeah it's

9745.96 --> 9750.089999999998
all good it was a good show very long

9748.39 --> 9754.42
again for a Monday

9750.09 --> 9756.31
yeah two hours 40 minutes damn I didn't

9754.42 --> 9758.17
expect I have a look at those a look at

9756.31 --> 9760.93
those photos when you get a chance and

9758.17 --> 9763.93
yeah yeah you know giant photos that's

9760.93 --> 9764.439
good yeah I've seen some of them around

9763.93 --> 9768.58
though

9764.439 --> 9772.689
so I recognize many of them I just think

9768.58 --> 9775.3
it's quite kind of good to see the

9772.689 --> 9776.529
mixture like human humans who are

9775.3 --> 9780.369999999999
working on them because you could kind

9776.529 --> 9783.25
of see this scale comparison although I

9780.37 --> 9785.199
I would really need to subject it to

9783.25 --> 9787.51
some Photoshop experts though because

9785.199 --> 9789.43
these things can be tricked and some of

9787.51 --> 9791.439
them have been tricked

9789.43 --> 9795.239
some of them I would really like that

9791.439 --> 9798.1
that those photos along with many more

9795.239 --> 9802.119999999999
different photos Katyn without metadata

9798.1 --> 9804.37
on them so there's no way to really have

9802.12 --> 9806.59
a look but all I know is there's some

9804.37 --> 9808.660000000002
you know from what I understand is meted

9806.59 --> 9809.279
out it's not that easy to remove from a

9808.66 --> 9814.18
photo

9809.279 --> 9816.85
so whoever had that software yeah yeah

9814.18 --> 9818.2
but there's an yeah that's one thing but

9816.85 --> 9822.49
but you can steal with

9818.2 --> 9825.19
the metadata just use forensics to

9822.49 --> 9827.38
figure out the data itself so I've seen

9825.19 --> 9829.57
people sexy what I want you to do I want

9827.38 --> 9831.609999999999
you to just pass it on to or do it

9829.57 --> 9834.4
yourself or because I'm you know just

9831.61 --> 9837.521
trying to get some answers and if you

9834.4 --> 9839.98
give me I will I will at least say sorry

9837.521 --> 9842.141000000001
so I would least save the pictures on my

9839.98 --> 9844.98
computer and now have them as a backup

9842.141 --> 9847.99
file so thanks for that thanks for

9844.98 --> 9849.699999999999
having those I'd like to see what you

9847.99 --> 9852.94
think and if you do find out some

9849.7 --> 9854.470000000001
forensics you know methods I'll give you

9852.94 --> 9858.9
a few more different ones and you can

9854.47 --> 9862.0
run the same analysis cool yeah right

9858.9 --> 9864.699999999999
okay so that's cool all right well

9862.0 --> 9868.57
thanks for talking now see you later

9864.7 --> 9871.931
they're 68 oh yeah so you did take a I

9868.57 --> 9872.44
took again cheese all right okay all

9871.931 --> 9880.2
right

9872.44 --> 9883.51
see you later so yeah that was good

9880.2 --> 9886.210000000001
thanks everyone for coming it's been a

9883.51 --> 9889.45
very long show for a Monday what it was

9886.21 --> 9891.939999999999
good and I hope you all enjoyed it so

9889.45 --> 9893.710000000001
please upload the video if you liked it

9891.94 --> 9896.431
or download it if you're a troll or

9893.71 --> 9899.680999999999
whatever I'm fine for this vote and

9896.431 --> 9902.460000000001
share the show I thought this show was

9899.681 --> 9906.880000000001
pretty good so yeah please do share it

9902.46 --> 9908.47
and subscribe to my channel if you

9906.88 --> 9910.119999999999
haven't already hit the bell

9908.47 --> 9913.061
notification so you see when I'm going

9910.12 --> 9916.86
live today I got life a little bit early

9913.061 --> 9919.21
but not too early and very long show

9916.86 --> 9920.800000000001
yeah and if you want to financially

9919.21 --> 9922.811
support me I brought it up earlier in

9920.8 --> 9924.609999999999
the show please do so through superjet

9922.811 --> 9926.32
I've done it I've got some donations on

9924.61 --> 9928.36
superyachts thank you very much for that

9926.32 --> 9929.949999999999
I also hope that at some point again see

9928.36 --> 9931.87
PayPal donations which are much more

9929.95 --> 9934.12
direct for me

9931.87 --> 9936.490000000002
yeah thanks everyone for supporting the

9934.12 --> 9942.460000000001
show that has supported me thank you

9936.49 --> 9944.561
very much and yeah I'm gonna do in the

9942.46 --> 9947.65
future more just throwing out links in

9944.561 --> 9950.99
the chat itself it kind of works it

9947.65 --> 9954.350999999999
works works oh it works fine

9950.99 --> 9956.75
my mood if I'm gonna do that or not but

9954.351 --> 9959.51
yeah if you want to talk to me offline
