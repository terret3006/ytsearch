170.16 --> 173.16
2022

174.41 --> 178.43
[Music]

180.62 --> 186.0
I had a bit of a weird habit change

183.959 --> 188.959
today

186.0 --> 188.959
took a coffee

191.099 --> 196.44
yeah

193.379 --> 197.54
so like I thought maybe that's gonna

196.44 --> 201.54
like

197.54 --> 205.07999999999998
force me past like the waking up stage

201.54 --> 206.7
and I do feel it has so far at least but

205.08 --> 208.8
it's also because I just got up very

206.7 --> 210.23899999999998
late I had a really long sleep this

208.8 --> 214.20000000000002
night

210.239 --> 216.18
and yeah that did a lot of good I think

214.2 --> 217.319
well that

216.18 --> 219.62
food

217.319 --> 223.5
that I made I ate a lot of it yesterday

219.62 --> 227.4
pretty much exclusively I think that all

223.5 --> 230.28
just right really needed to digest

227.4 --> 231.78
and I do feel great

230.28 --> 234.06
right

231.78 --> 236.7
but I don't want to get into like this

234.06 --> 237.599
very late Rhythm so hopefully this will

236.7 --> 240.06
help

237.599 --> 242.959
kind of like reset my time and get me

240.06 --> 242.959
tired earlier

243.659 --> 246.2
right

249.0 --> 254.3
[Music]

263.639 --> 269.54
so yeah yesterday was kind of an

267.06 --> 269.54
eventful

270.3 --> 275.14
no fvd

272.88 --> 276.36
Premiere was good though

275.14 --> 279.02
[Music]

276.36 --> 279.02000000000004
uh

282.419 --> 286.34
Quantum of conscious head of video

286.5 --> 289.759
that was kind of interesting

290.42 --> 293.569
[Music]

294.479 --> 300.74
uh and that was about it I mean Jim Bob

297.479 --> 303.65999999999997
had like a really late night stream

300.74 --> 306.44
but that was so late that I just like no

303.66 --> 306.44
I'm going to bed

307.02 --> 311.75899999999996
uh

308.699 --> 314.88
so that was about it

311.759 --> 316.8
I did go and watch like the new Cobra

314.88 --> 319.94
Kai season though

316.8 --> 319.94
almost through it

323.22 --> 329.96000000000004
kind of interesting it's really weird

325.56 --> 329.96

330.06 --> 334.4
[Music]

332.94 --> 336.66
foreign

334.4 --> 338.75899999999996
but yeah I've heard other people's

336.66 --> 340.56
commentary on it and it does seem like

338.759 --> 343.91900000000004
it's a bit

340.56 --> 345.9
lower quality I mean it it's like

343.919 --> 349.28
starting to feel a little bit more like

345.9 --> 349.28
an up soap opera

349.74 --> 352.82
in that fourth season

353.699 --> 357.86
it's like all too much setup

359.22 --> 364.33000000000004
still it's

361.259 --> 366.41900000000004
