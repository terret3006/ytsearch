76.539 --> 86.11
show number 333 and yeah a new look for

84.31 --> 90.78
the show I did a test run yesterday

86.11 --> 95.47
evening as promised and got a few flaws

90.78 --> 106.69
ironed out of the way and Wow

95.47 --> 108.67
there we go it's mostly Adam ikan he's

106.69 --> 110.619
the one that actually had the

108.67 --> 114.94
understanding of what you can do with

110.619 --> 116.5
the program and he found all these yeah

114.94 --> 119.489
these things and he designed the logo

116.5 --> 121.78
from scratch so pretty impressive

119.489 --> 123.97
although sometimes I wish that the

121.78 --> 128.019
background of that logo would actually

123.97 --> 131.23
be an animated picture that would be the

128.019 --> 135.73000000000002
background that would be awesome I don't

131.23 --> 137.76899999999998
think that's possible that what but yeah

135.73 --> 142.17
thanks Adam ikan for all the work you

137.769 --> 142.17000000000002
did and for your patience with me

145.36 --> 152.09
so yeah it's still not perfect there may

149.42 --> 153.89
be some issues with the chat get that

152.09 --> 157.629
figured out although so far it seems to

153.89 --> 157.629
be going yeah smoothly

168.37 --> 179.739
well massage Salim I think it he did it

171.73 --> 182.04999999999998
as an act of friendship you know I'd

179.739 --> 185.34
help him up if he really needed

182.05 --> 185.34
something that I could give

190.739 --> 196.73000000000002
anyway yeah I'm gonna go through the

193.019 --> 202.489
chat let's see

196.73 --> 207.89999999999998

249.03 --> 256.94
see you all

251.03 --> 264.99
Julia Pavan I hope I didn't skip you

256.94 --> 268.32
right so today by the way I'm a bit off

264.99 --> 273.15000000000003
in the order too distracted by my own

268.32 --> 274.889
screen but today the weather is what's

273.15 --> 277.34999999999997
not bad really

274.889 --> 280.38
it was actually quite nice and sunny

277.35 --> 288.389
just a few minutes ago but now this

280.38 --> 293.34
cloud moved over but yeah it's even been

288.389 --> 302.21000000000004
kind of nice and warm in a way so yeah

293.34 --> 305.36999999999995
nice day nice Thursday 17 October 2019

302.21 --> 305.37
[Music]

305.51 --> 314.0
so I have to Merrick off you with me she

309.6 --> 314.0
might have seen and T that's it

316.08 --> 322.32
all right yeah the birds doing great I

324.09 --> 329.85999999999996
gave him a cracker but I'm not gonna

328.84 --> 335.42999999999995
call him Paulie

329.86 --> 335.43
oh hello Karen be away

342.61 --> 351.8
yeah it's funny that the creature has a

346.82 --> 356.12
tendency to check me out every time I go

351.8 --> 358.85
walking so it's not crowing to me

356.12 --> 361.97
anymore as much funnily enough maybe it

358.85 --> 364.94
picked up off up on my signals maybe it

361.97 --> 368.72
was just hoping I would get a crow

364.94 --> 370.73
parent type response because I've seen

368.72 --> 372.68
him begging towards other crows as well

370.73 --> 378.23
it's kind of weird maybe he is still

372.68 --> 382.22
kind of young could be but yeah he

378.23 --> 385.42
stopped doing that but he's still just

382.22 --> 389.54
he's actually being just quite nice and

385.42 --> 391.76
quiet and sometimes just does crow calls

389.54 --> 401.45000000000005
I actually been practicing it a little

391.76 --> 404.21
myself and my views on Jose show I had

401.45 --> 408.02
that there's no fuse of mine um how they

404.21 --> 411.10999999999996
show didn't even click it didn't feel

408.02 --> 418.01
like it didn't get to it no idea what

411.11 --> 422.02000000000004
was happening over there and I'm not

418.01 --> 422.02
gonna call him sparrow hm

424.83 --> 433.87899999999996
for starters he's not a sparrow and Jack

430.56 --> 433.879
doesn't feel right

439.98 --> 442.98
No

450.98 --> 458.19
that's gonna do my Birds calls here

453.75 --> 461.419
that's it's not good enough anyway I

458.19 --> 464.77
might add at some point just apply it

461.419 --> 468.18
for a fun and expectedly but I don't

464.77 --> 468.18
[Music]

468.979 --> 475.16999999999996
that doesn't work

472.07 --> 475.17
[Music]

477.63 --> 482.07
right so yeah if you guys want to inform

480.48 --> 484.40000000000003
me about anything that's been going on

482.07 --> 488.9
I'm gonna be happy to get some tips

484.4 --> 488.9
let's see what I did do

494.25 --> 501.03
yeah there were just a lot of separate

496.68 --> 502.5
hangouts and things going on oh god yes

501.03 --> 506.15999999999997
now I remember

502.5 --> 510.66
oh god yeah I started watching Star Trek

506.16 --> 514.44
The Next Generation it it's been a long

510.66 --> 519.0
time since I've seen that and it is very

514.44 --> 522.2700000000001
odd to see it again it's so weird

519.0 --> 525.09
because I don't know ever since I saw

522.27 --> 527.79
Star Trek Voyager that really caught my

525.09 --> 530.52
heart the most in a way was more

527.79 --> 534.5999999999999
condensed more it has more feel of

530.52 --> 536.88
realness to it for me but the next

534.6 --> 539.64
generation yeah I watched that with my

536.88 --> 541.83
family and everything back in the day it

539.64 --> 546.53
was like boo thing we would always go

541.83 --> 549.84
and watch during dinner or something and

546.53 --> 553.17
it was kind of presented as a family

549.84 --> 556.83
show to just all this weird relation

553.17 --> 561.12
stuff with it with the kid the kid

556.83 --> 563.1
genius this is anyway I'm still in the

561.12 --> 566.66
first season so it's still a bit woody

563.1 --> 570.57
all of it I guess we'll see how that

566.66 --> 573.75
continues flowing I still remember that

570.57 --> 577.0400000000001
I just especially the way the characters

573.75 --> 579.42
end it all up is quite was quite good

577.04 --> 583.1999999999999
remember and the movies are excellent

579.42 --> 588.26
that relate to the next generation crews

583.2 --> 590.99
so and pretty much all of their works

588.26 --> 596.18
because a lot of that crew have done

590.99 --> 599.28
voiceovers or what do you mean just

596.18 --> 602.28
narration for for example animated

599.28 --> 606.66
characters that kind of thing a lot also

602.28 --> 609.6899999999999
in games in early games in the 90s you

606.66 --> 612.6
know what's so freaking amazing for me

609.69 --> 615.47
is that for example when I play baldur's

612.6 --> 618.51
gate and from that franchise games

615.47 --> 622.53
sometimes I just recognize the voices

618.51 --> 623.83
like oh my god it's it's Troy like she

622.53 --> 626.78
did a lot of voice

623.83 --> 629.12
very distinct she has a beautiful voice

626.78 --> 631.76
and I recognized that voice anytime no

629.12 --> 635.51
matter what she does and it's so awesome

631.76 --> 637.73
for me it's kind of special but anyway

635.51 --> 640.34
it started watching that again and got

637.73 --> 643.5500000000001
caught up in it like watch truth I think

640.34 --> 648.11
five episodes or something so I kind of

643.55 --> 651.3499999999999
lost track of everything else but before

648.11 --> 660.01
that there just were a lot of videos

651.35 --> 660.01
going around and of course my test

664.35 --> 670.87
sleeping warriors a quest update with

668.56 --> 675.16
the whole political situation it's

670.87 --> 678.4590000000001
really interesting he's got something

675.16 --> 681.8389999999999
and yeah he's really starting to wield

678.459 --> 681.8389999999999
it it's it's interesting

694.89 --> 698.33
I'll open and cook

698.68 --> 705.42
and Lahti says by the way Ragnar Stefan

702.91 --> 705.42
elderson

706.499 --> 709.1890000000001
Laurey

713.299 --> 722.129
yeah the theme of the show that's right

716.119 --> 724.9390000000001
if that's about the glow just as a as a

722.129 --> 727.649
focus focusing point a focal point

724.939 --> 734.699
because that's really what the whole

727.649 --> 739.309
thing is about that's what I'm really

734.699 --> 742.019
trying to do creating my own baseline

739.309 --> 744.449
and just being honest about as many

742.019 --> 747.889
things as possible and it's quite a

744.449 --> 750.269
struggle to deal with your own

747.889 --> 753.269
presuppositional needs things that

750.269 --> 754.889
you've been conditioned to do to get

753.269 --> 757.399
that all out of the way and then deal

754.889 --> 763.999
with all the impulses that remain and

757.399 --> 763.999
that's a big part of actually

769.06 --> 772.05
okay

792.98 --> 802.08
think there may be yeah police

796.85 --> 804.9300000000001
gangjae's here good yeah there's like

802.08 --> 815.5500000000001
over there on that side there's a lot of

804.93 --> 817.3199999999999
trouble though anyway to get back to

815.55 --> 821.13
what I was talking about before the

817.32 --> 828.21
outside world distracted me the whole

821.13 --> 832.59
point me doing this is just giving an

828.21 --> 840.8100000000001
example of in how you can be honest in

832.59 --> 843.21
totality be consistent and then every

840.81 --> 846.4499999999999
time yeah you make mistakes and it

843.21 --> 849.69
happens why a man in retrospect so many

846.45 --> 851.7900000000001
typical neurotic effects I contained at

849.69 --> 853.9200000000001
the start of this process even the start

851.79 --> 855.42
of the early bird show because I really

853.92 --> 857.8199999999999
worked on it during the whole early work

855.42 --> 860.37
show the doing things everyday really

857.82 --> 862.95
enforced the persistency factor for me

860.37 --> 866.8100000000001
like the persistent it becomes much more

862.95 --> 870.45
important or I start to falter so I

866.81 --> 875.4899999999999
looked for the all the borders where can

870.45 --> 881.58
I go how and now this is just what I do

875.49 --> 883.6800000000001
and when I do it I have this freedom to

881.58 --> 886.47
basically say okay look there are so

883.68 --> 890.8399999999999
many things that we don't know but there

886.47 --> 895.71
is a lot of data well a lot there's not

890.84 --> 897.99
data that encompasses all things yet but

895.71 --> 901.0500000000001
there is a lot of data that we can work

897.99 --> 905.13
with so from that point on it is

901.05 --> 908.7299999999999
wherever you allow presupposition in

905.13 --> 912.6899999999999
some way to alter what could be possible

908.73 --> 914.91
and you can then start well

912.69 --> 916.7600000000001
figuring out what could be possible

914.91 --> 919.35
that's what I've been doing most of the

916.76 --> 921.72
most of the time most of the trip from

919.35 --> 926.1
the start actually

921.72 --> 928.9590000000001
is just getting more honest about what

926.1 --> 931.9300000000001
what things are absolute and there's

928.959 --> 934.569
very little of them and what things are

931.93 --> 938.199
just based on some kind of hope of what

934.569 --> 944.139
could be and some things are just

938.199 --> 947.5889999999999
blatantly false and covered up those are

944.139 --> 950.279
the worst so and everybody that even

947.589 --> 954.4300000000001
tries to conceptualize where we live

950.279 --> 956.699
they all are prone to detailed mistakes

954.43 --> 960.91
based on these impulses on these

956.699 --> 965.3499999999999
presuppositional needs the things we are

960.91 --> 968.56
used to that nobody discouraged because

965.35 --> 973.509
it's normal out there everybody's just

968.56 --> 975.6099999999999
allowed to do whatever and that like a

973.509 --> 977.5
trance brings you to that level

975.61 --> 981.24
eventually if you don't a very

977.5 --> 981.24
meticulous attention to your behavior

981.54 --> 989.259
and well I have this freedom and I just

986.05 --> 993.13
have to be detailed so in a way I am

989.259 --> 996.189
trying to enact what I originally

993.13 --> 998.259
conceptualized before I know about this

996.189 --> 1001.259
scientific method and all that the

998.259 --> 1003.63
things to the rigidity thoroughness that

1001.259 --> 1007.139
I've learned now but how I originally

1003.63 --> 1012.42
conceptualized how to become a real

1007.139 --> 1015.689
scientist and not a a think tank pawn or

1012.42 --> 1017.3389999999999
a spin doctor for authorities of some

1015.689 --> 1020.61
kind or powers of some kind because

1017.339 --> 1023.61
that's what I didn't want I wanted the

1020.61 --> 1027.35
truth based scientific pursuit the

1023.61 --> 1032.76
original idea that has been grafted into

1027.35 --> 1037.799
science fiction and into the cover

1032.76 --> 1040.4089999999999
stories for for yeah neoliberalism and

1037.799 --> 1042.27
communism that are obviously fake part

1040.409 --> 1045.0890000000002
about that that really inspired me that

1042.27 --> 1047.1
caught me into that web early on to

1045.089 --> 1050.78
figure it out that that's just it's a

1047.1 --> 1058.6999999999998
lie they're exactly the opposite

1050.78 --> 1061.16
and right I am just doing that I'm doing

1058.7 --> 1064.19
that despite the world so in in a way I

1061.16 --> 1067.25
am feeling like I'm becoming the

1064.19 --> 1071.48
scientist I wanted to be opposing the

1067.25 --> 1073.4
world but genuine like it's just very

1071.48 --> 1078.14
important it's the only thing that makes

1073.4 --> 1080.1200000000001
it valuable and but yeah of course

1078.14 --> 1083.44
calling myself a scientist in that

1080.12 --> 1087.6399999999999
fashion is more colloquial it's more

1083.44 --> 1090.38
religious you could say but in my case

1087.64 --> 1094.64
purely based on truth I do not anchor

1090.38 --> 1099.2800000000002
myself in atheism which is a very

1094.64 --> 1099.2800000000002
typical stumbling block in this approach

1103.57 --> 1111.1699999999998
so yeah I do abide by the scientific

1108.8 --> 1114.3799999999999
method but yet to call myself a

1111.17 --> 1116.39
scientist I do have to perform science I

1114.38 --> 1119.45
guess I don't know what does even make

1116.39 --> 1121.67
you qualify as being a scientist whether

1119.45 --> 1124.39
you understand it or not good John say

1121.67 --> 1127.3700000000001
he's a scientist because he has applied

1124.39 --> 1130.5500000000002
the scientific method properly for

1127.37 --> 1133.07
example would he want to would people

1130.55 --> 1136.49
want to call themselves scientists or it

1133.07 --> 1139.28
has the the concept the cultural

1136.49 --> 1142.88
connotation of scientists just been so

1139.28 --> 1145.31
politicized to the heliocentrism way of

1142.88 --> 1148.88
thinking an atheist and that it's not

1145.31 --> 1151.34
viable for the future could that be the

1148.88 --> 1153.6200000000001
case I don't know but what I originally

1151.34 --> 1158.4199999999998
conceptualized as what a scientist

1153.62 --> 1161.9299999999998
should be like is what I am trying to

1158.42 --> 1164.5700000000002
achieve and being a teacher is also a

1161.93 --> 1167.45
big part for me as I conceptualized

1164.57 --> 1170.21
being a scientist is it's not just

1167.45 --> 1174.8300000000002
learning it's also teaching it's it's

1170.21 --> 1180.25
just an open group spiritual mental

1174.83 --> 1180.25
growth process and anyone can tap in

1184.08 --> 1191.37
so that's what I originally tried to

1186.9 --> 1192.2
achieve is to just be honest and in the

1191.37 --> 1194.6399999999999
process

1192.2 --> 1200.31
anybody that should be watching should

1194.64 --> 1203.0400000000002
and that can get into it that can find

1200.31 --> 1204.81
yet the the understanding the keys to

1203.04 --> 1206.79
the things that I mentioned that I

1204.81 --> 1211.37
explained very elaborately once they get

1206.79 --> 1215.0
it then they much more clearly will see

1211.37 --> 1219.03
why flat-earthers

1215.0 --> 1221.91
they have doubts about the globe so it's

1219.03 --> 1224.61
not even you get the site not based on

1221.91 --> 1226.47
what this is true and that must be false

1224.61 --> 1229.4299999999998
or the other way around which is the

1226.47 --> 1232.79
political view but you just get to see

1229.43 --> 1236.16
the stacks of evidence in honest

1232.79 --> 1238.11
statistical overview roughly and you

1236.16 --> 1240.74
just weigh the preponderance of evidence

1238.11 --> 1243.03
and then you see yes it's very logical

1240.74 --> 1245.16
that everybody has doubts about the

1243.03 --> 1251.22
globe that doesn't necessarily have to

1245.16 --> 1253.0400000000002
lead to the earth being flat in a direct

1251.22 --> 1256.56
sense or in whatever these people

1253.04 --> 1258.6299999999999
presuppose but the doubts about the

1256.56 --> 1261.33
globe are based on the lack of evidence

1258.63 --> 1266.91
and on the false yet the for easily

1261.33 --> 1272.12
falsified claims that are just obviously

1266.91 --> 1275.13
broken incorrect and that is what really

1272.12 --> 1277.6399999999999
enhances the doubts about the globe more

1275.13 --> 1277.64
than anything

1280.46 --> 1289.94
and that should be a clear sign to

1284.72 --> 1293.539
anyone that is actually building is

1289.94 --> 1301.5700000000002
building their lore is building their

1293.539 --> 1301.57
skill to create they should see that

1302.32 --> 1306.49
[Music]

1317.4 --> 1327.25
right but in a way Brandon cook I also

1323.37 --> 1331.27
what I do I I don't know if this is

1327.25 --> 1334.84
viable for the world even but just cause

1331.27 --> 1337.72
mechanical speculation I consider it an

1334.84 --> 1340.81
art and I always very enthusiastic when

1337.72 --> 1344.71
I noticed people can be can go with that

1340.81 --> 1347.35
and do it as well on the same level or

1344.71 --> 1356.98
even temporary and I kind of wish that

1347.35 --> 1359.86
it could be like it could be its own its

1356.98 --> 1362.29
own study direction it wouldn't

1359.86 --> 1367.4699999999998
technically be science I guess it would

1362.29 --> 1370.69
be more math geometry science inspired

1367.47 --> 1376.18
it's signed speculation science-based by

1370.69 --> 1378.7
physics based geometry speculation

1376.18 --> 1380.8300000000002
what would you classify it would be

1378.7 --> 1383.74
classified pseudoscience of course but I

1380.83 --> 1387.49
still think that it would be a useful

1383.74 --> 1391.3
thing if it existed in between things

1387.49 --> 1394.1200000000001
you can learn as you're growing you

1391.3 --> 1398.86
should go to the University perhaps just

1394.12 --> 1402.31
as a subject because it helps you to

1398.86 --> 1405.8999999999999
visualize it makes you more creative and

1402.31 --> 1409.21
they have more overview it has artistic

1405.9 --> 1414.39
applications huge artistic applications

1409.21 --> 1414.39
if you get really good at it it's great

1420.119 --> 1428.259
so alright that's kind of what I hope

1426.119 --> 1434.7389999999998
that'll happen eventually

1428.259 --> 1436.96
Oh knows maybe yeah oh my god I just

1434.739 --> 1440.47
realized that who knows maybe this is

1436.96 --> 1445.47
gonna lead up to cause much and he

1440.47 --> 1445.47
studies being part of arts class options

1446.22 --> 1455.8890000000001
not my original intention but who knows

1451.83 --> 1459.519
it would may be a practical ushion at

1455.889 --> 1463.7389999999998
the time or whatever weird when I think

1459.519 --> 1463.739
about it but yeah

1468.45 --> 1474.7
that's I guess it's bound to draw

1471.07 --> 1477.129
artistic types in general as I said the

1474.7 --> 1478.6490000000001
artistic applications are massive if

1477.129 --> 1487.57
you're really skilled at it

1478.649 --> 1490.899
so yeah my visions for the future and

1487.57 --> 1493.9289999999999
these are not based on the the dream

1490.899 --> 1497.86
like the dark world experiences that I

1493.929 --> 1500.6490000000001
had these are just the things that are

1497.86 --> 1509.049
coming forth as sight from these moments

1500.649 --> 1514.4499999999998
itself it's not the same it's more hope

1509.049 --> 1518.559
based I guess trying to find sensible

1514.45 --> 1520.799
purpose sensible and honest purpose for

1518.559 --> 1520.799
things

1525.83 --> 1533.08
so anyway yes sorry for ignoring chat so

1529.549 --> 1533.08
much and just on a rant here

1555.86 --> 1564.1589999999999
ah I should get you guys on this but

1559.309 --> 1569.0
yeah I don't have a I don't have a panel

1564.159 --> 1575.2990000000002
design ready yet still got to work on

1569.0 --> 1580.09
that I will so it's gonna be yeah just

1575.299 --> 1582.769
me and the intro and the chat for now

1580.09 --> 1584.33
I'd love to hear you guys opinions about

1582.769 --> 1586.929
just the experience of the show

1584.33 --> 1586.9289999999999
afterward

1608.33 --> 1611.53
[Music]

1611.95 --> 1614.95
okay

1616.93 --> 1620.38
[Music]

1623.67 --> 1629.519
[Music]

1636.94 --> 1640.039
[Music]

1646.039 --> 1654.299
mm-hmm I'm looking at the video I wonder

1650.789 --> 1656.399
if I could loop it in a way that it

1654.299 --> 1662.509
would just go back and forth instead of

1656.399 --> 1664.86
just clicking to refresh the video

1662.509 --> 1670.909
because that way it wouldn't be so

1664.86 --> 1670.9089999999999
abrupt I can do that

1674.75 --> 1677.679
like that

1680.17 --> 1689.52
anyway calm down everyone

1689.85 --> 1693.58
yeah toady in chat yesterday wasn't that

1692.89 --> 1702.5200000000002
something

1693.58 --> 1706.3
I am tough the energy pretty high just

1702.52 --> 1711.6399999999999
kept on going it was like he was trying

1706.3 --> 1714.34
to rump as my chat it's ridiculous

1711.64 --> 1717.1200000000001
because I had the sole voice of course

1714.34 --> 1719.83
in the show but he just kept on doing

1717.12 --> 1725.62
the same thing over and over again just

1719.83 --> 1728.32
being surprised that he probably wasn't

1725.62 --> 1730.9199999999998
getting timed out and I didn't want it

1728.32 --> 1738.07
to get timed out because it was just

1730.92 --> 1741.16
perfect and was perfect so yeah thank

1738.07 --> 1744.9299999999998
you for that moment toady it's kind of

1741.16 --> 1748.99
reckless of you but you really

1744.93 --> 1752.5
strengthened my point you really

1748.99 --> 1757.39
emphasized why I started out doing that

1752.5 --> 1762.33
and proved to us all that it was just

1757.39 --> 1765.49
it's a really big thing it's so big that

1762.33 --> 1768.58
none of you can get even out of the

1765.49 --> 1770.95
political zone in your responses you're

1768.58 --> 1773.71
just not even recognizing that I'm that

1770.95 --> 1775.96
I'm technically correct and that the

1773.71 --> 1778.41
burden of proof lies with you who makes

1775.96 --> 1778.41
the claim

1778.65 --> 1796.3200000000002
ah thank you Dave rakia cafard or when

1794.25 --> 1799.34
you're a very smart studied the Bible

1796.32 --> 1803.84
and see what it tells you

1799.34 --> 1803.84
Thanks yeah

1808.2 --> 1811.41
[Music]

1811.55 --> 1818.83
it's toady and chat here I I don't see

1816.41 --> 1818.8300000000002
him anywhere

1821.91 --> 1826.27
[Music]

1828.87 --> 1838.86
I didn't block him did I that's weird

1835.48 --> 1838.8600000000001
let me check it out

1855.41 --> 1858.529
[Music]

1863.58 --> 1866.1789999999999
nope

1866.84 --> 1872.899
not didn't think I had he's not here so

1871.549 --> 1873.59
I don't know what people keep him

1872.899 --> 1876.86
talking

1873.59 --> 1885.019
like he is he's not really here anyway

1876.86 --> 1892.2199999999998
oh really

1885.019 --> 1896.24
Aaron Armstrong you please justify the

1892.22 --> 1898.1290000000001
claim that you're making that because I

1896.24 --> 1900.44
claim the earth isn't the sphere the

1898.129 --> 1902.7489999999998
burden of proof lies with me that I

1900.44 --> 1907.009
don't think that is how burden of proof

1902.749 --> 1909.83
works the burden of proof is not with

1907.009 --> 1914.24
the one disbelieving something it is

1909.83 --> 1922.129
with the one that claims something isn't

1914.24 --> 1925.249
it and well this believing I'm not

1922.129 --> 1930.4699999999998
making a very specific alternative claim

1925.249 --> 1937.8790000000001
as an absolute I have conceptualizations

1930.47 --> 1941.8990000000001
I have models but that I have don't have

1937.879 --> 1946.639
sufficient proof to back certain aspects

1941.899 --> 1950.119
of my models so I'm not laying the claim

1946.639 --> 1952.85
there I'm I'm putting presuppositions in

1950.119 --> 1956.4089999999999
place when I talk about that those

1952.85 --> 1961.779
factors in my model and I do put out how

1956.409 --> 1961.779
these aspects can be falsified

1964.71 --> 1979.3600000000001
basically planning ahead so how do you

1977.5 --> 1987.01
back a claim of not believing in

1979.36 --> 1989.35
something well how do you prove it

1987.01 --> 1992.35
something is not it well you can

1989.35 --> 1997.27
basically try to break apart the claim

1992.35 --> 2000.06
but that's not part of how that works

1997.27 --> 2002.07
really because if you don't believe in

2000.06 --> 2004.71
something that doesn't make you a claim

2002.07 --> 2007.59
that it doesn't make you a claim er it

2004.71 --> 2010.5
makes you doubt another claim that's the

2007.59 --> 2012.87
disbelief part this belief is directed

2010.5 --> 2016.5
towards the claim claim of the earth

2012.87 --> 2018.57
being a globe and why is that that's the

2016.5 --> 2021.78
Purdham personal motivation that's

2018.57 --> 2028.97
personal insight that's false outside of

2021.78 --> 2032.43
the claim or the scientific validity and

2028.97 --> 2034.5
well if you go there then it's very easy

2032.43 --> 2037.8200000000002
just go with logical consistency

2034.5 --> 2040.71
geometry or the physics that we learn

2037.82 --> 2045.78
then you the holes reveal themselves

2040.71 --> 2050.12
within the model of the claim that

2045.78 --> 2055.89
claims being made there's holes in there

2050.12 --> 2059.81
and also false presentations to back the

2055.89 --> 2063.0
claim obvious machinations very shameful

2059.81 --> 2066.24
very bad to do that and to be revealed

2063.0 --> 2069.38
at it and keep on going it's just it's a

2066.24 --> 2069.3799999999997
terrible way to go

2073.639 --> 2079.909
[Music]

2075.309 --> 2084.6690000000003
so yeah if you can find a claim that I

2079.909 --> 2087.319
made that I can't back up then yeah I

2084.669 --> 2090.739
totally get it I would love to be

2087.319 --> 2094.249
pointed for example I love when people

2090.739 --> 2096.95
think that I can't proof a holographic

2094.249 --> 2099.3799999999997
nature of the Moon for example well

2096.95 --> 2101.509
that's actually very easy to do because

2099.38 --> 2109.369
what are the consequences of the claim

2101.509 --> 2112.999
well that there's light and you can very

2109.369 --> 2115.4
easily falsify it by proving a physical

2112.999 --> 2118.16
nature but in order to prove that

2115.4 --> 2121.7000000000003
physical nature there's certain

2118.16 --> 2124.459
phenomena that you need that need to

2121.7 --> 2128.6299999999997
exist that need to be proven in order to

2124.459 --> 2130.819
begin establishing a physical nature to

2128.63 --> 2133.099
lay the claim of the physical nature and

2130.819 --> 2134.599
if you've provided evidence for that

2133.099 --> 2137.6600000000003
claim that would suffice

2134.599 --> 2142.569
yeah that would falsify the holographic

2137.66 --> 2147.259
nature but until that this proof that

2142.569 --> 2149.719
falsification proof has been found I

2147.259 --> 2152.029
have all the proof I need for a

2149.719 --> 2153.9990000000003
holographic nature of the Moon because

2152.029 --> 2158.42
there's a lot of light and a lot of

2153.999 --> 2159.859
light related effects that concern the

2158.42 --> 2162.6800000000003
moon and everything considered

2159.859 --> 2165.8289999999997
concerning the moon is light everything

2162.68 --> 2168.1989999999996
about it everything that we see how it

2165.829 --> 2171.289
affects everything it's all light based

2168.199 --> 2177.339
so the holographic nature is blatantly

2171.289 --> 2177.3390000000004
there provable it's like

2177.71 --> 2186.67
and if we understand the nature of light

2180.91 --> 2192.29
then you know that all the elements are

2186.67 --> 2197.38
there that's it so yeah it's very clear

2192.29 --> 2197.38
what I what I claim and why

2200.96 --> 2208.43
if you'd like to falsify my claim of a

2206.42 --> 2211.9
holographic nature there are several

2208.43 --> 2216.1299999999997
ways you could do it I already proposed

2211.9 --> 2218.21
them on my show and on other people show

2216.13 --> 2220.28
there are several things the baller

2218.21 --> 2222.11
could do and at the same time you would

2220.28 --> 2224.0600000000004
be backing your own claim so hey

2222.11 --> 2226.85
wouldn't that be a win-win situation for

2224.06 --> 2230.84
you you'd prove a claim of certain

2226.85 --> 2232.97
phenomena and that would draw doubt into

2230.84 --> 2235.1000000000004
my claim of holographic nature wouldn't

2232.97 --> 2240.14
that be a win-win why don't you guys go

2235.1 --> 2242.27
do it you who made the claim I've

2240.14 --> 2245.21
provided all the evidence for my claim

2242.27 --> 2249.32
that I need but you could potentially

2245.21 --> 2251.69
have the ability to falsify what my

2249.32 --> 2254.3300000000004
claim is and therefore kind of yeah

2251.69 --> 2256.46
making it tougher on me to claim that so

2254.33 --> 2260.18
why don't you do it why don't you just

2256.46 --> 2265.12
take the win win ticket and provide

2260.18 --> 2265.12
evidence for your claims ballers

2269.51 --> 2274.0400000000004
[Music]

2281.1 --> 2287.17
yeah see now look you're all doing what

2285.31 --> 2289.75
you love to do and that's just drawing

2287.17 --> 2292.2000000000003
in false equivalences saying Oh a

2289.75 --> 2294.46
hologram that means it's that

2292.2 --> 2297.46
technological device that has a specific

2294.46 --> 2302.02
project projection called a hologram

2297.46 --> 2302.32
well that's that's not what I'm talking

2302.02 --> 2304.27
about

2302.32 --> 2309.8500000000004
when they say a holographic nature I

2304.27 --> 2312.64
mean light based and how that hologram

2309.85 --> 2315.19
that holographic effect is established I

2312.64 --> 2318.2799999999997
don't know yet working on it it's not

2315.19 --> 2320.8
really relevant to the baseline

2318.28 --> 2323.7400000000002
assertion though of a holographic nature

2320.8 --> 2326.8500000000004
of a light based nature because that is

2323.74 --> 2330.1
there it's there all the proof I need

2326.85 --> 2333.21
for the claim is there but it can be

2330.1 --> 2335.98
falsified if you can prove

2333.21 --> 2337.96
scientifically that there are phenomena

2335.98 --> 2340.06
that would point at a physical nature

2337.96 --> 2345.34
because if it has a physical nature

2340.06 --> 2348.1
provably so that yeah falsifies my proof

2345.34 --> 2355.84
my baseline assertion of a holographic

2348.1 --> 2358.27
nature Hey yeah go ahead you know it's

2355.84 --> 2361.38
so easy thing you've been claiming for

2358.27 --> 2361.38
so long we'll go ahead

2368.47 --> 2376.8689999999997
oh god bill Thompson doesn't matter what

2373.63 --> 2380.98
you test if anything goes looking I'm

2376.869 --> 2386.079
not talking about looks looks don't

2380.98 --> 2389.589
prove a physical nature okay a hologram

2386.079 --> 2393.25
even the technology of holograms thing

2389.589 --> 2397.39
on earth can project pretty much

2393.25 --> 2400.39
anything to look like anything even

2397.39 --> 2403.1189999999997
physical there may be very very physical

2400.39 --> 2405.67
can make it look so physical that you

2403.119 --> 2408.79
would just say oh man I can now grab

2405.67 --> 2411.88
that and then as you approach it it it

2408.79 --> 2414.339
distorts or whatever ya can look very

2411.88 --> 2417.2400000000002
physical that's not proof of a physical

2414.339 --> 2417.24
nature you dummy

2423.15 --> 2436.53
screw you Bill Thompson that's a total

2426.069 --> 2436.5299999999997
red herring seriously Trish piss off

2437.46 --> 2441.26
stupid scam artist

2448.76 --> 2451.8190000000004
[Music]

2473.4 --> 2483.84
oh yeah those are the best the most

2477.66 --> 2489.47
effective one [ __ ] there's a certain

2483.84 --> 2492.4500000000003
group of people that perfected it and

2489.47 --> 2497.8999999999996
the perfection of their art is called

2492.45 --> 2497.8999999999996
banking look into that

2535.63 --> 2542.289
so funny how it works you know everybody

2538.719 --> 2545.109
cools down once I just stop reminding

2542.289 --> 2550.9590000000003
people of that painful truth that day

2545.109 --> 2553.839
that the ball SIL is that the ball is in

2550.959 --> 2557.3799999999997
their court they're the ones making the

2553.839 --> 2562.959
claims and it is in their best interest

2557.38 --> 2565.299
from all angles presupposing assuming at

2562.959 --> 2568.69
the time being that their motivations

2565.299 --> 2570.969
are genuine and honesty based in their

2568.69 --> 2576.91
beliefs and all that the ball is in

2570.969 --> 2581.279
their court if they provide the evidence

2576.91 --> 2586.509
for their claim they got so many wins so

2581.279 --> 2588.519
if their motivation is genuine then why

2586.509 --> 2592.809
are they spending all this time and

2588.519 --> 2595.3289999999997
skill not doing it and trying to

2592.809 --> 2597.9990000000003
manipulate others especially the people

2595.329 --> 2601.65
that are pointing at this and trying to

2597.999 --> 2605.4399999999996
manipulate them into somehow believing

2601.65 --> 2607.719
that the ball is in our court that we're

2605.44 --> 2611.289
the ones that need to provide the

2607.719 --> 2615.849
evidence for their claim and until them

2611.289 --> 2617.949
until then they are right that's their

2615.849 --> 2619.42
parameters and those parameters are

2617.949 --> 2623.19
completely delusional

2619.42 --> 2625.9590000000003
that's not that's how things work in

2623.19 --> 2630.579
politics in social relations perhaps

2625.959 --> 2635.229
that's not how things work in honestly

2630.579 --> 2637.63
approaching reality so yeah a lot of

2635.229 --> 2639.6989999999996
triggered people every time I do this

2637.63 --> 2641.8900000000003
it's just immediately you know I know

2639.699 --> 2643.599
they're watching and they're it's almost

2641.89 --> 2645.339
like they're just watching and calm and

2643.599 --> 2647.2290000000003
just seeing our wind talk having their

2645.339 --> 2649.119
own with little reflections then as soon

2647.229 --> 2651.549
as I really bring on the serious

2649.119 --> 2653.17
subjects all of a sudden over who

2651.549 --> 2655.5389999999998
they're all animated and if you have to

2653.17 --> 2658.119
type their their little troll response

2655.539 --> 2662.829
their immediate counterweights

2658.119 --> 2664.7490000000003
to stuff that little piece of light from

2662.829 --> 2665.55
getting through and changing their

2664.749 --> 2670.95
attitude

2665.55 --> 2676.86
because that would ruin the plan the

2670.95 --> 2681.08
plan a really Ragnar Stefan Alderson you

2676.86 --> 2685.46
do how where where are they

2681.08 --> 2688.77
can you pre please provide the evidence

2685.46 --> 2692.25
for your claim that you back up your

2688.77 --> 2702.5099999999998
claims Ragnar Stefan Alderson because I

2692.25 --> 2705.96
don't think you have well yeah

2702.51 --> 2708.0
see mister complainy pants mister

2705.96 --> 2711.03
complain about you where did you bear me

2708.0 --> 2715.52
where did he bade me well that's why i

2711.03 --> 2720.0800000000004
ban you because of that kind of comment

2715.52 --> 2720.08
it's total lack of self control

2720.38 --> 2727.78
that's why look another one

2724.33 --> 2727.7799999999997
[Music]

2728.76 --> 2731.48
anymore

2732.14 --> 2740.419
[Music]

2742.96 --> 2749.21
Yama's here mother Salim they usually do

2746.299 --> 2757.309
that but that's not even what this is

2749.21 --> 2760.099
about it's just about the baseline the

2757.309 --> 2762.98
actual foundation of the things that are

2760.099 --> 2765.71
supposedly upholding this model that is

2762.98 --> 2768.14
the claims that come with them that are

2765.71 --> 2771.23
being made yet there's so little

2768.14 --> 2774.2889999999998
evidence or actually none to back them

2771.23 --> 2777.71
up yet even though it would be such a

2774.289 --> 2780.4990000000003
win for the globus from many angles to

2777.71 --> 2783.529
prove these phenomena are there for real

2780.499 --> 2786.2
and I totally encourage them and

2783.529 --> 2791.21
genuinely so because I'd be fascinated

2786.2 --> 2794.839
to see for example a moon signal rebound

2791.21 --> 2798.369
phenomena that is really real by having

2794.839 --> 2801.259
it been demonstrated in the setup that I

2798.369 --> 2803.96
have explained now multiple times so

2801.259 --> 2806.119
it's not yeah not gonna go through all

2803.96 --> 2808.91
of that again if you want to know

2806.119 --> 2811.4
exactly what the setup is I explained it

2808.91 --> 2812.8689999999997
yesterday it probably did the day before

2811.4 --> 2815.21
that and the day before that I seem to

2812.869 --> 2817.779
keep on explaining it because it's just

2815.21 --> 2823.009
a thing now and need to Ram it through

2817.779 --> 2828.44
the people so they get it it's just like

2823.009 --> 2830.21
it yet it's really serious it's serious

2828.44 --> 2835.13
and it's also neutral it's not a

2830.21 --> 2838.099
political move that I'm doing by going

2835.13 --> 2841.9990000000003
for the specific claim the specific

2838.099 --> 2844.099
claims but especially this one it's not

2841.999 --> 2847.069
a political move it's a genuine interest

2844.099 --> 2850.9700000000003
and it's also in the interest of open

2847.069 --> 2854.44
science because providing evidence for

2850.97 --> 2857.66
claims is what science is all about it's

2854.44 --> 2861.41
not fundamentally about disproving

2857.66 --> 2864.8489999999997
things that is a misconception what it

2861.41 --> 2867.95
is however is that there must be a way

2864.849 --> 2873.549
to disprove it logically

2867.95 --> 2878.8089999999997
that is the the null hypothesis or the

2873.549 --> 2883.13
yeah if there is no way to disprove it

2878.809 --> 2886.3390000000004
then it's it's faulty it's it's

2883.13 --> 2888.23
incorrect that's part of the science

2886.339 --> 2890.869
that doesn't mean that you can't prove

2888.23 --> 2895.01
anything no absolutely you can but if

2890.869 --> 2898.25
there's no way to disprove it then then

2895.01 --> 2900.9500000000003
you can't have make a viable yeah

2898.25 --> 2904.28
scientific claim with that that's why I

2900.95 --> 2905.93
focus on that a lot including the

2904.28 --> 2909.26
aspects for example of the

2905.93 --> 2911.5589999999997
presupposition of a loop how can you

2909.26 --> 2914.7200000000003
actually begin to prove that

2911.559 --> 2916.4300000000003
presupposition how do you do that well

2914.72 --> 2919.8489999999997
I've looked into that carefully and

2916.43 --> 2923.27
created a experimental set up with a

2919.849 --> 2928.94
null that can absolutely disprove the

2923.27 --> 2930.94
loop but it may also just reveal the

2928.94 --> 2933.98
nature of the loop and a lot of

2930.94 --> 2936.559
complications with the conceptualization

2933.98 --> 2939.41
as I explained the loop can be irregular

2936.559 --> 2941.3590000000004
the loop can turn out to be not a

2939.41 --> 2946.67
perfectly straight line it can be a

2941.359 --> 2950.72
spectrum with an arc and get as weird as

2946.67 --> 2953.39
that the flat realm is just loop wise

2950.72 --> 2955.8489999999997
interconnected exactly like if it were

2953.39 --> 2959.18
the surface of a globe even though all

2955.849 --> 2962.809
of it is flat the flat globe mentioned

2959.18 --> 2967.3999999999996
in the very very first video that I live

2962.809 --> 2969.98
streamed on my channel another one of

2967.4 --> 2972.4100000000003
those crazy things of creation a

2969.98 --> 2976.099
challenge a huge challenge that might

2972.41 --> 2977.859
turn out to be out there in the end but

2976.099 --> 2980.809
it's pretty remote it's all a lot of

2977.859 --> 2983.089
presuppositions considering the looping

2980.809 --> 2985.88
aspect and irregularities about it so it

2983.089 --> 2989.54
is basically a loop presupposition based

2985.88 --> 2993.319
model option that I'm considering when I

2989.54 --> 2996.349
talk about the flat globe I hope that

2993.319 --> 2998.18
understanding will sink in more and more

2996.349 --> 3001.27
over time

2998.18 --> 3001.27
[Music]

3005.049 --> 3009.149
ILO Adam Eakin my way

3032.869 --> 3040.049
now but spare room music that's the

3036.509 --> 3046.829
whole fun of it the ball is not in my

3040.049 --> 3049.949
court to disprove your yeah your

3046.829 --> 3052.9790000000003
evidence because your evidence is not

3049.949 --> 3056.099
provided you've made the claims there's

3052.979 --> 3059.0989999999997
no proof there's no proof that actually

3056.099 --> 3061.8900000000003
graduates that can actually qualify a

3059.099 --> 3065.819
scientific proof it's part of the whole

3061.89 --> 3068.459
issue so the ball is not in my court

3065.819 --> 3070.799
it's in yours to provide evidence for

3068.459 --> 3072.779
your claim and that goes in all kinds of

3070.799 --> 3075.39
directions I'm just focusing mainly on

3072.779 --> 3078.269
just a few aspects of them that have my

3075.39 --> 3084.199
personal interest because the celestial

3078.269 --> 3084.1989999999996
phenomena phenomena interest me

3090.4 --> 3097.63
but yeah I don't have to disprove the

3094.75 --> 3101.34
globe because the proof that has

3097.63 --> 3105.01
supposedly been provided for the claims

3101.34 --> 3109.1200000000003
to back up that the earth is supposedly

3105.01 --> 3114.4
a globe have been lacking and broken or

3109.12 --> 3115.5699999999997
just not present altogether that's yeah

3114.4 --> 3119.05
I don't

3115.57 --> 3121.51
it's I'm just have to point at it it's

3119.05 --> 3123.79
the Nathan way in a way it's very basic

3121.51 --> 3125.7400000000002
but it works it's real

3123.79 --> 3127.18
you just have to point at it I'm not the

3125.74 --> 3133.7799999999997
one making the claim the earth is a

3127.18 --> 3138.3399999999997
globe and I have my own convictions as

3133.78 --> 3140.5600000000004
to why it is flat but those are not

3138.34 --> 3148.33
scientific claims those are just based

3140.56 --> 3152.74
on my own figuring out of data like for

3148.33 --> 3155.56
example the the optical data of super

3152.74 --> 3157.3599999999997
long distance photography results the

3155.56 --> 3160.95
optical slant effect the apparent

3157.36 --> 3165.9
horizon edge and the concealment zone

3160.95 --> 3169.8999999999996
beyond that debt actually conceals

3165.9 --> 3171.46
things slightly more and more as you go

3169.9 --> 3175.63
further into the distance and that

3171.46 --> 3177.61
concealment rate turns out so far with

3175.63 --> 3182.35
everything I've seen to be completely

3177.61 --> 3185.26
linear concealment rate is linear beyond

3182.35 --> 3187.48
the optical slant and that linearity is

3185.26 --> 3192.1600000000003
a strong indicator when it comes to

3187.48 --> 3196.5
geometry that there is no curvature that

3192.16 --> 3200.17
there is if there is no common

3196.5 --> 3202.15
accumulation of any kind in a drop or

3200.17 --> 3206.85
consuming or anything out there that

3202.15 --> 3210.58
just points very vividly to a flat

3206.85 --> 3215.3399999999997
geometrical aspect and not any kind of

3210.58 --> 3219.88
curve not any kind of ya curve that's it

3215.34 --> 3224.4900000000002
so that is the evidence that I one of

3219.88 --> 3227.05
the evidence that I draw my conclusions

3224.49 --> 3235.5699999999997
but those are not scientifically backed

3227.05 --> 3237.7000000000003
claims so yeah if you want to do believe

3235.57 --> 3239.32
the earth to be a globe just as a belief

3237.7 --> 3242.49
that's all up to you but if you're

3239.32 --> 3245.6200000000003
actually going to put in the weight of

3242.49 --> 3247.12
scientific validity to it yeah then

3245.62 --> 3250.2599999999998
you're gonna have to provide some

3247.12 --> 3250.2599999999998
evidence for those claims

3255.329 --> 3260.6090000000004
then yeah the evidence has to actually

3258.149 --> 3264.169
be so far they have to be sufficient it

3260.609 --> 3264.169
has to be valid

3281.09 --> 3283.7200000000003
Wow

3311.38 --> 3319.12
all right Chris berry indeed perspective

3315.16 --> 3321.8399999999997
is linear as well although yeah there

3319.12 --> 3327.69
look perspective is complicated and

3321.84 --> 3332.6800000000003
perspective is also part of the whole

3327.69 --> 3334.75
consequence of optics so it's partially

3332.68 --> 3336.73
because of perspective that there is an

3334.75 --> 3340.63
apparent horizon that the concealment

3336.73 --> 3343.2400000000002
zone it's probably inherent to the

3340.63 --> 3346.7200000000003
effect and I'm still trying to puzzle

3343.24 --> 3351.0699999999997
out why the sieve reflections don't even

3346.72 --> 3354.9399999999996
spawn up well if to me what we associate

3351.07 --> 3356.98
that with most is where the refraction

3354.94 --> 3358.9
of light starts to turn into a

3356.98 --> 3361.8
reflection of light and it turned

3358.9 --> 3366.31
anything will turn into a mirror a

3361.8 --> 3370.09
mirror like yeah effect and I think that

3366.31 --> 3372.34
is what does it in some way and I don't

3370.09 --> 3376.05
completely understand the nature of it

3372.34 --> 3381.13
but that's what those are hints within

3376.05 --> 3384.79
things that I've seen as to what could

3381.13 --> 3388.48
be potentially causing that what could

3384.79 --> 3392.05
be the fundamental effect that makes

3388.48 --> 3394.95
that effect do what I do does that a

3392.05 --> 3394.9500000000003
phenomena is

3398.21 --> 3406.46
bill Thompson yeah piss off dude you're

3401.42 --> 3408.38
really annoying and your straw Manning

3406.46 --> 3410.69
the [ __ ] out of everything and you're

3408.38 --> 3413.15
just straight-up lying again with more

3410.69 --> 3425.9900000000002
claims about things just total nonsense

3413.15 --> 3429.859
so yeah I've seen plenty of footage

3425.99 --> 3433.16
Larry I've seen footage of a freaking

3429.859 --> 3436.2799999999997
Sun going behind a mountain that was

3433.16 --> 3441.19
what is it again over a thousand miles

3436.28 --> 3443.5690000000004
away just don't be ridiculous

3441.19 --> 3447.71
consumed on trait and it's just an

3443.569 --> 3449.329
optical side effect of what happens

3447.71 --> 3451.819
after a certain point when you look over

3449.329 --> 3455.03
a flat surface and the closer you are to

3451.819 --> 3457.609
that flat surface or the closer by that

3455.03 --> 3462.92
point starts the consequent rate beyond

3457.609 --> 3465.3489999999997
that is linear thanks close by concealed

3462.92 --> 3469.4300000000003
little things far away conceal a little

3465.349 --> 3471.92
bit more and it keeps on growing in

3469.43 --> 3476.72
height the amount of the amount

3471.92 --> 3478.64
concealed in total we envision it grows

3476.72 --> 3481.22
in a linear rate and the further away it

3478.64 --> 3483.609
goes it doesn't subtly or exponentially

3481.22 --> 3483.609
jump

3495.28 --> 3498.94
piss off dude

3514.75 --> 3517.9
yeah Aaron Armstrong you can go screw

3517.18 --> 3521.3999999999996
yourself

3517.9 --> 3521.4
stop being a [ __ ]

3538.1 --> 3544.4
anyway I'm gonna round out the show it's

3540.44 --> 3550.06
been long enough no it's actually been

3544.4 --> 3552.83
exactly an hour right right yeah so yeah

3550.06 --> 3555.0099999999998
provide evidence for your clean boilers

3552.83 --> 3559.16
for your claims your scientific

3555.01 --> 3563.03
supposedly backed claims would be really

3559.16 --> 3566.72
nice if you did that some time and don't

3563.03 --> 3569.15
try to shove in my shoes that I should

3566.72 --> 3571.4599999999996
be the one providing the evidence

3569.15 --> 3573.35
against your claims when you haven't

3571.46 --> 3576.68
provided the evidence for your claims

3573.35 --> 3579.11
and when you have we tested it's just

3576.68 --> 3582.2
broken there's no sufficient evidence

3579.11 --> 3585.86
just but just go with the moon signal

3582.2 --> 3589.43
rebounds come on it's so easy it should

3585.86 --> 3591.98
be so easy to do that why won't you just

3589.43 --> 3594.5
do it it's just one little step just one

3591.98 --> 3598.28
little chocolate one little chocolate

3594.5 --> 3600.29
you can do it so easy you even tell me

3598.28 --> 3602.5400000000004
it's supposedly so easy that I can do it

3600.29 --> 3604.43
even though I'm widely known not to have

3602.54 --> 3606.68
a lot of money so you can do it because

3604.43 --> 3608.8999999999996
you have all this money to do it do it

3606.68 --> 3612.7999999999997
in a way that I said you need to do it

3608.9 --> 3618.44
and prove there is a phenomena and I'll

3612.8 --> 3623.3300000000004
applaud you right so thanks everyone for

3618.44 --> 3625.58
coming if you like this 330 third show

3623.33 --> 3628.1
please don't forget to upload it and if

3625.58 --> 3629.75
you haven't already subscribed to my

3628.1 --> 3631.0699999999997
channel and hit the bell notification so

3629.75 --> 3635.18
you know when I'm going live which is

3631.07 --> 3637.07
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time also

3635.18 --> 3640.73
please do support my channel through the

3637.07 --> 3643.6000000000004
super chat paypal patreon oh my go fund

3640.73 --> 3646.85
me that would be much appreciated and

3643.6 --> 3647.36
yeah I guess I'm gonna continue on with

3646.85 --> 3650.93
Flat Earth

3647.36 --> 3652.07
early-bird number 334 tomorrow and I'm

3650.93 --> 3655.4199999999996
going to join the Flat Earth debate

3652.07 --> 3659.44
right after this so until the next video

3655.42 --> 3659.44
keep it flat

3661.71 --> 3669.04
[Music]

3666.09 --> 3677.17
hold on there seems to be some technical

3669.04 --> 3678.65
difference okay for some reason let's

3677.17 --> 3701.579
try that again

3678.65 --> 3701.579
[Music]

3704.2 --> 3706.2599999999998
you
