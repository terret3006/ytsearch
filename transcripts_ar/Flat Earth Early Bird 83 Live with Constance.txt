5.029 --> 12.66
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

9.3 --> 15.48
early-bird number 83 I'm your host

12.66 --> 19.98
Arwen and today I'm starting out with a

15.48 --> 23.15
guest thank to God thank you God

19.98 --> 27.26
Constance hello Constance

23.15 --> 32.79
hello Arlen hello everyone

27.26 --> 35.94
yeah much appreciated and a very long

32.79 --> 39.78
long talk several times I think even

35.94 --> 45.87
yesterday night and they did a lot of

39.78 --> 49.289
good one moment

45.87 --> 53.25
all right because yesterday was pretty

49.289 --> 60.0
crazy one way or the other

53.25 --> 62.34
I'm on a call I'm on a call I'm on a

60.0 --> 66.479
call so don't make noise I'm gonna turn

62.34 --> 75.39
my mic back on I could turn it off when

66.479 --> 81.0
I heard you coming in ok I'm back and

75.39 --> 83.759
well anyway it's hard to basically miss

81.0 --> 87.33
what happened yesterday to anyone since

83.759 --> 91.439
all like immediately of course Tim that

87.33 --> 93.6
the total narcissist sociopath was gonna

91.439 --> 95.85
make fun of it because he has no

93.6 --> 101.369
feelings and he doesn't understand real

95.85 --> 103.32
things looking as yes you could just toy

101.369 --> 105.869
with people's feelings it's no problem

103.32 --> 107.63999999999999
that snore or is just all weird the

105.869 --> 109.35
normal ones he's crazy because he has

107.64 --> 111.57000000000001
feelings that I don't understand because

109.35 --> 116.61
I can't see them because I'm a sociopath

111.57 --> 119.54899999999999
and everybody's all why are you getting

116.61 --> 122.67
so upset about Tim doing this and now

119.549 --> 124.97900000000001
it's just a review just talking about

122.67 --> 126.96000000000001
it's perfectly normal to make fun of

124.979 --> 129.31
somebody when they are at their most

126.96 --> 131.68
vulnerable it's perfectly normal

129.31 --> 134.47
like yeah I put it out in the open you

131.68 --> 138.81900000000002
know I planned for this I planned to do

134.47 --> 142.0
that so yeah then of course anyone can

138.819 --> 144.7
do whatever they want with that without

142.0 --> 147.63
any moral objection because that's

144.7 --> 151.06
normal right people that is normal to

147.63 --> 154.93
make fun of others in their most

151.06 --> 160.2
vulnerable that's perfectly doable it's

154.93 --> 163.03
no no objections at least in his world

160.2 --> 167.89
and some of the people that went in

163.03 --> 170.79
there and just greedily yeah you're

167.89 --> 175.14999999999998
totally right him so happy we're here

170.79 --> 177.66
doing this so normal all normal because

175.15 --> 177.66
we say so

183.75 --> 190.17
hey everybody in the chatroom I'm going

186.06 --> 193.8
to focus on our win but you have more

190.17 --> 197.03
love in there and it's just difficult to

193.8 --> 201.36
pay attention and write to you guys

197.03 --> 204.27
right now for anyone out there and wants

201.36 --> 209.21
to understand what this was okay what

204.27 --> 216.57000000000002
that is it is depression literally and

209.21 --> 219.36
oppression is not yeah that can be it

216.57 --> 223.57999999999998
okay but it can also be in another way

219.36 --> 227.33
it can make things too intense too heavy

223.58 --> 233.06
makes things heavier it makes things

227.33 --> 235.95000000000002
closer strangles you with the truth with

233.06 --> 237.6
the reality that is what really

235.95 --> 240.14999999999998
depression does and that's what I

237.6 --> 245.57
experienced and that's what caused that

240.15 --> 248.31
[ __ ] okay and I have that I have had

245.57 --> 252.35999999999999
swing of the pendulum I've even talked

248.31 --> 257.489
about this over the years okay swing of

252.36 --> 262.04900000000004
the pendulum and eventually I can't stop

257.489 --> 266.15999999999997
it from going there and then I become

262.049 --> 269.34
shaky and I become volatile in my own

266.16 --> 274.47
way and then I have to be very careful

269.34 --> 276.45
not to lose control and start doing

274.47 --> 279.90000000000003
damage that I have to account for

276.45 --> 282.0
afterward so yeah the damage that I did

279.9 --> 285.77
allow in this case was purely verbal was

282.0 --> 292.56
purely what was hidden on the inside and

285.77 --> 295.28999999999996
I let it break through that's it the

292.56 --> 299.46
valve escape we had the it had to get

295.29 --> 302.07
out so you could stabilize again yes and

299.46 --> 306.62
I also needed to do it to look at it

302.07 --> 312.14
again because yeah as I explained

306.62 --> 315.17
I hid it from my own consciousness it

312.14 --> 319.37
was a hole in my consciousness that I

315.17 --> 324.44
put there to protect myself

319.37 --> 327.38
and yeah when you take that away yeah

324.44 --> 330.59
then you feel the pain then you feel the

327.38 --> 333.83
pain of why you put that there and that

330.59 --> 335.78
is why you people you Globus that's why

333.83 --> 342.34999999999997
you have that hole in your consciousness

335.78 --> 343.25
why you can't see it it's that pain well

342.35 --> 346.19
I did it

343.25 --> 349.63
I took it and that's what a man does or

346.19 --> 352.21999999999997
a responsible human being

349.63 --> 355.46
yeah man woman doesn't really matter a

352.22 --> 357.38000000000005
responsible human being they they'll

355.46 --> 359.93
walk up to that hole in their

357.38 --> 362.0
consciousness they notice it see you

359.93 --> 364.82
this is not right I'm not seeing it

362.0 --> 368.48
what's going on here and then they open

364.82 --> 372.89
it up and they look and they suffer but

368.48 --> 375.41
they grow better for it that's what a

372.89 --> 380.71999999999997
real human being does and not a coward

375.41 --> 384.26000000000005
not a weasel not a a program a cog in

380.72 --> 389.39000000000004
the system just dissolving themselves in

384.26 --> 390.86
the system Lewis you're confronted

389.39 --> 394.82
you're supposed to do that you're

390.86 --> 398.48
supposed to walk up to yourself and look

394.82 --> 405.5
in the holes in your consciousness and

398.48 --> 408.17
fix them open it up and then fix them we

405.5 --> 412.04
call facing our fears and confronting

408.17 --> 414.62
our Giants and then slaying them right

412.04 --> 416.45000000000005
somehow eventually have it that don't

414.62 --> 420.14
like the comparison Giants thing but

416.45 --> 424.90999999999997
yeah and that's the same I call it a

420.14 --> 428.21
dungeon but it's also part of maturing

424.91 --> 431.939
and there's no really no age limit to

428.21 --> 437.37899999999996
that spiritual maturing

431.939 --> 439.79900000000004
every day until we die it's part of

437.379 --> 451.269
growing it's part of the battle it's

439.799 --> 453.00899999999996
it's not for wimps that's for sure every

451.269 --> 458.829
time we go through this we get stronger

453.009 --> 462.969
it's not you know the day we give up the

458.829 --> 467.619
fight is when it's really over you can't

462.969 --> 470.55899999999997
drop the guard we do find a place of

467.619 --> 474.879
rest here and there but we always end up

470.559 --> 479.459
having to face these as some people call

474.879 --> 479.459
facing our demons are facing our or

480.119 --> 492.369
challenges in life I don't I don't hold

489.159 --> 496.80899999999997
it against you I I couldn't laugh I did

492.369 --> 500.319
cry watching you because I came in after

496.809 --> 502.499
it was over I came online after it was

500.319 --> 507.72900000000004
all over and heard talk and I'm going oh

502.499 --> 510.819
and what I could watch was so painful I

507.729 --> 515.43
could I could sense your pain I could

510.819 --> 519.4590000000001
hear it and see it right through it I

515.43 --> 524.62
didn't I never thought holy crap the guy

519.459 --> 526.6289999999999
is you know it never occurred to me to

524.62 --> 529.269
say you need psychotic you know

526.629 --> 532.779
psychological help I knew you were in

529.269 --> 536.379
pain and you needed moral support was

532.779 --> 542.1
all not you know moral spiritual support

536.379 --> 544.41
but not opioids or no you know

542.1 --> 549.37
antidepressants that those actually

544.41 --> 552.519
aggravated god help us what if if like

549.37 --> 555.49
if I would have met some freaking doctor

552.519 --> 557.23
or whatever convinced me that because of

555.49 --> 559.649
the pain I needed to take that [ __ ]

557.23 --> 561.429
there's no saying what might happen

559.649 --> 564.19
that's for sure

561.429 --> 566.949
like you can actually

564.19 --> 569.7090000000001
switch around and all that deepness all

566.949 --> 573.04
that hurt may actually swing around into

569.709 --> 576.79
a giant manic fit that can go so far

573.04 --> 579.1899999999999
that you live that it yeah mania there

576.79 --> 582.639
is nothing more dangerous than extreme

579.19 --> 585.1
mania because anything goes then and

582.639 --> 587.98
there's no more borders you people will

585.1 --> 591.22
jump off a building because they think

587.98 --> 593.86
they can fly they just can't resist the

591.22 --> 597.87
sensation of that glory anymore that's

593.86 --> 599.769
the problem with true mania and

597.87 --> 602.829
antidepressants can be extremely

599.769 --> 605.379
dangerous especially if you start doing

602.829 --> 609.189
that [ __ ] in the Haight or in the depth

605.379 --> 613.48
of a process like this I've always

609.189 --> 615.639
avoided it like very wary I've avoided

613.48 --> 620.1700000000001
it like freaking pedophiles seriously

615.639 --> 622.75
it's like like oh yeah I would love to

620.17 --> 627.75
think it would be a solution but I feel

622.75 --> 627.75
it's not feel it's incredibly dangerous

628.23 --> 640.689
it it's how can I put this that it pulls

635.649 --> 645.42
you down into an abyss and if you were

640.689 --> 650.74
desperate already it just intensifies it

645.42 --> 652.4799999999999
to the point where you don't you might

650.74 --> 655.87
not even feel like you take you can take

652.48 --> 658.149
another breath without feeling that pain

655.87 --> 661.2090000000001
and you want that pain to go away so

658.149 --> 663.48
badly it's as if you were in a torture

661.209 --> 667.2589999999999
chamber or being assaulted by the

663.48 --> 670.3290000000001
Spanish Inquisition oh god where are you

667.259 --> 673.3000000000001
where you there's it's relentless and

670.329 --> 678.399
you want it to end and the desperation

673.3 --> 681.6099999999999
will cause you to literally snap and

678.399 --> 685.75
you'll either hurt yourself or you'll

681.61 --> 688.6
hurt someone else or both and neither of

685.75 --> 695.339
them neither of those options are good

688.6 --> 695.339
in any way yeah

697.84 --> 706.57
all right but it's funny funny it's

702.85 --> 709.8000000000001
tragic and funny I that's not really

706.57 --> 714.34
funny but sometimes I do we like and

709.8 --> 716.26
here on a everything a lookout over the

714.34 --> 718.09
place and sometimes like in the middle

716.26 --> 720.76
of night this happens like every now and

718.09 --> 723.52
then like an a guy or a girl will

720.76 --> 727.6899999999999
absolutely be screaming in depression

723.52 --> 729.4
like it's weird there it's like somebody

727.69 --> 731.62
it never done can't even make out

729.4 --> 734.29
exactly who they are but somebody's then

731.62 --> 736.9
just biking on their bicycle very hard

734.29 --> 741.1899999999999
and just screaming like almost like like

736.9 --> 743.74
me like and then it's like I

741.19 --> 747.7600000000001
it's so obvious what's going on with

743.74 --> 750.04
them if any there didn't you it's

747.76 --> 752.1899999999999
they're battling depression and if you

750.04 --> 755.14
don't get it you're like where does this

752.19 --> 757.24
if you're like a sociopath you're gonna

755.14 --> 759.6
be hard this is funny or is he did you

757.24 --> 763.15
so I'm gonna make a video about this and

759.6 --> 766.36
pretend like I am a psychiatrist no

763.15 --> 769.36
that's my point exactly where someone

766.36 --> 772.96
wants to have a commentary they have no

769.36 --> 776.83
training and I don't let me put okay I

772.96 --> 779.5
don't think that that person is

776.83 --> 783.9000000000001
qualified I think that person has an

779.5 --> 790.45
agenda and the person has a has a an

783.9 --> 793.6899999999999
intention of bringing coloring a certain

790.45 --> 797.8900000000001
way not just seeing it for what it is

793.69 --> 799.33
but I can't even know if questions is

797.89 --> 802.12
what they always do it's what they all

799.33 --> 804.76
do all the holes the globe instead of

802.12 --> 807.73
the psychology the hole the real

804.76 --> 809.23
feelings hole all the holes covering it

807.73 --> 811.45
all up just yeah

809.23 --> 815.1700000000001
paint over this doesn't exist it's not

811.45 --> 819.5200000000001
real and no everything is all you're all

815.17 --> 821.86
free oh there is no god it's all just an

819.52 --> 824.59
illusion it's all it's all right

821.86 --> 827.98
no holes there's no holes you can't see

824.59 --> 831.76
him and I won't let you see him so it

827.98 --> 835.69
doesn't exist that's what he does and Oh

831.76 --> 839.62
like we talked yesterday psychiatry and

835.69 --> 841.6300000000001
psychology are not prepared to deal with

839.62 --> 845.2
the spiritual side of things they can

841.63 --> 849.85
only examine from a physical side or a

845.2 --> 851.62
mental side as in logic and the ability

849.85 --> 854.26
to symptomatic

851.62 --> 857.14
yeah symptomatic is not holistic they

854.26 --> 861.76
don't understand my reason for the

857.14 --> 864.1
things really they have done yeah they

861.76 --> 868.74
come to it with a presupposition that it

864.1 --> 871.8000000000001
is a mental or emotional or physical

868.74 --> 873.64
disease or condition they are not

871.8 --> 876.4
understanding that there's something

873.64 --> 879.55
behind that and something greater than

876.4 --> 881.62
that this or that it's cyclical that

879.55 --> 884.74
most of those conditions are cyclical

881.62 --> 887.38
over time it's not even really spoken

884.74 --> 890.41
about like psychiatrists know it from

887.38 --> 892.51
experience from their clients but it's

890.41 --> 897.61
not actually part of the material that

892.51 --> 900.91
they learn that it takes years for them

897.61 --> 903.49
to get the experience to be able to say

900.91 --> 906.52
that about someone anyone caught just

903.49 --> 909.36
one client or patient

906.52 --> 914.05
whichever where they like to call it

909.36 --> 918.64
where and again you can't assume that

914.05 --> 921.04
because patient a has this situation

918.64 --> 923.59
then the same should apply to patient be

921.04 --> 926.74
patient C be patient and so on it

923.59 --> 930.1600000000001
doesn't work that way that's the crux of

926.74 --> 932.47
individuality is everyone has their

930.16 --> 935.43
point of breaking everyone has their

932.47 --> 938.4300000000001
point of boiling everyone has their

935.43 --> 943.27
their point of no return

938.43 --> 946.51
everyone has their point of coping their

943.27 --> 950.14
ability and and experience in facing

946.51 --> 954.1
their demons with help they they don't

950.14 --> 958.63
ever come to this automatically it

954.1 --> 963.009
I hope and so in my life walk

958.63 --> 966.519
I see people either choosing to find

963.009 --> 968.11
that help or not and the one that when

966.519 --> 973.2090000000001
they try to find that help in the

968.11 --> 977.23
medical area they get something less

973.209 --> 980.0189999999999
than help it's just a numb if they find

977.23 --> 983.44
something to numb the pain or to numb

980.019 --> 988.3
the brain the nerves remove it it's just

983.44 --> 991.36
like remove it cover it up to put it in

988.3 --> 993.79
so far that the patient has the option

991.36 --> 1000.0
to pretend like it no longer exists

993.79 --> 1002.67
that's always what it tries to do you

1000.0 --> 1004.259
can get a electric shock treatment or

1002.67 --> 1011.0999999999999
even on the bottom you know those are

1004.259 --> 1015.269
the extreme madness and I don't I don't

1011.1 --> 1017.1
call those solutions I call those you

1015.269 --> 1018.48
know that they're inhumane and they they

1017.1 --> 1022.009
don't help you

1018.48 --> 1026.39
Desilu from that is not victory that is

1022.009 --> 1032.939
that is death literally that is death

1026.39 --> 1040.949
dissolution mm-hmm just destroyed

1032.939 --> 1042.0500000000002
basically yep anyway yes thanks thanks

1040.949 --> 1044.0600000000002
for being here

1042.05 --> 1045.9199999999998
right on time even though I wasn't right

1044.06 --> 1048.6799999999998
on time much appreciated

1045.92 --> 1051.73
I really really I told you yesterday

1048.68 --> 1055.22
like I need I need somebody on my panel

1051.73 --> 1058.4
I need to talk about it need I need some

1055.22 --> 1061.25
reflection over all this to the people

1058.4 --> 1064.01
because it was so extreme and they need

1061.25 --> 1067.66
to understand what the purpose of this

1064.01 --> 1071.45
was what this was from all the angles

1067.66 --> 1074.03
and also to see that like I know I are

1071.45 --> 1076.22
we did not just turn into a raving

1074.03 --> 1079.73
maniac nutcase and he's going to do this

1076.22 --> 1083.51
every day now no no it's a it's a peak

1079.73 --> 1084.95
its order a valley oh when it's what I

1083.51 --> 1092.0
was at its height

1084.95 --> 1096.1100000000001
they had it slow yeah it was specific

1092.0 --> 1098.24
and focused it wasn't to you know it

1096.11 --> 1100.6399999999999
wasn't directed to the populace there's

1098.24 --> 1103.46
a specific group of people you were

1100.64 --> 1110.41
addressing and you were you were very

1103.46 --> 1110.41
clear man so yeah

1110.56 --> 1117.1
it's I don't expect you to go out and

1114.01 --> 1118.87
harm people or no this was this was

1117.1 --> 1122.23
shouting that's the very keep in your

1118.87 --> 1125.4699999999998
world I wasn't that few but even like

1122.23 --> 1127.69
afterward just thinking about like what

1125.47 --> 1130.44
if that would really happen from a

1127.69 --> 1134.17
composition what it I would probably

1130.44 --> 1136.18
like be totally freaked out like oh my

1134.17 --> 1138.01
god what is happening I get it's like oh

1136.18 --> 1144.93
yeah it was inevitable but it would

1138.01 --> 1144.93
still be like well I don't like violence

1147.51 --> 1155.68
but yeah in this case it was just yeah

1152.92 --> 1158.92
as I said it seemed inevitable that

1155.68 --> 1162.4
something like this must happen if

1158.92 --> 1168.66
nothing else is done to stop stop the

1162.4 --> 1168.66
madness in the world in the court system

1169.08 --> 1183.84
back in the day when I was married a

1173.74 --> 1189.16
young wife and reaching moments of utter

1183.84 --> 1192.76
frustration I would imagine I would long

1189.16 --> 1194.95
for I would pray for an open field

1192.76 --> 1199.75
somewhere where I could just scream I

1194.95 --> 1203.3500000000001
was so frustrated because I was dealing

1199.75 --> 1208.18
with a human being who was trying to do

1203.35 --> 1211.33
everything that the the oppressor would

1208.18 --> 1214.8400000000001
do to me I felt completely oppressed and

1211.33 --> 1216.01
controlled and manipulated and I didn't

1214.84 --> 1220.03
know how to deal with it

1216.01 --> 1222.07
I was I it was difficult to separate the

1220.03 --> 1225.73
person from the actions and from the

1222.07 --> 1229.95
words but it was it was a real learning

1225.73 --> 1233.05
experience I've often told my children

1229.95 --> 1235.15
if I had my choices I wouldn't have

1233.05 --> 1238.87
chosen that path if I knew what I was

1235.15 --> 1241.48
going to learn I probably wouldn't have

1238.87 --> 1244.2399999999998
chosen that ah but that's the path I

1241.48 --> 1247.39
took and this is the life

1244.24 --> 1251.77
have it was given to me and I made the

1247.39 --> 1256.9
choices that led me there so my

1251.77 --> 1259.45
variables were particular they were

1256.9 --> 1262.179
defined and I had to manipulate my

1259.45 --> 1265.75
independent variables about what would

1262.179 --> 1268.5400000000002
work what we would make it work and I

1265.75 --> 1271.059
wasn't talking about I want to make my

1268.54 --> 1274.0
marriage work at that point it was how

1271.059 --> 1276.46
can I make life work at all I was

1274.0 --> 1280.63
getting real down to to the bare bones

1276.46 --> 1285.07
of it I was frustrated with life right

1280.63 --> 1287.41
and the world's needle dog the graft to

1285.07 --> 1289.75
breakthrough somewhere not yeah

1287.41 --> 1294.0400000000002
died out in and like this stalemate

1289.75 --> 1295.99
where everything is just stuck yeah you

1294.04 --> 1298.57
feel like there's walls that you're

1295.99 --> 1300.61
beating your head up against and and

1298.57 --> 1302.9199999999998
there's doors you're beating with your

1300.61 --> 1305.74
fists and nothing is moving nothing's

1302.92 --> 1308.17
happening it keeps you know it keeps

1305.74 --> 1313.09
occurring and I am NOT getting anywhere

1308.17 --> 1317.23
so I had to I had to be still

1313.09 --> 1321.61
I had to still myself and get real quiet

1317.23 --> 1325.51
and stop screaming and start listening

1321.61 --> 1328.6599999999999
and asking and paying attention taking

1325.51 --> 1334.03
note and learning and you literally have

1328.66 --> 1336.7900000000002
to become like a child excuse me in the

1334.03 --> 1343.75
presence of the one who's going to teach

1336.79 --> 1349.1789999999999
you and I now but back then it was it

1343.75 --> 1353.83
was huge and even now it's cyclical I'd

1349.179 --> 1356.26
go through stages and if I feel

1353.83 --> 1362.37
instability now it's like okay I know

1356.26 --> 1362.37
what I need to do and it works for me

1365.76 --> 1374.53
it's amazing this it's hard for me to

1371.35 --> 1377.8
even you can just keep on talking in

1374.53 --> 1383.62
that sense it is amazing I feel it I

1377.8 --> 1387.79
feel you have like the similar type of

1383.62 --> 1390.2199999999998
process as I just in your way and you

1387.79 --> 1392.29
probably feel the same for me it's like

1390.22 --> 1393.76
you know you take you take your life

1392.29 --> 1396.9099999999999
very seriously

1393.76 --> 1399.34
that's basically what it that is you

1396.91 --> 1402.72
take it real seriously you look at every

1399.34 --> 1404.86
detail but also throughout the way and

1402.72 --> 1407.98
when you take everything seriously

1404.86 --> 1411.1599999999999
especially if you're young you will also

1407.98 --> 1414.73
as you are young hit your heart your

1411.16 --> 1419.71
head very hard on that which you cannot

1414.73 --> 1422.58
understand that only really happens when

1419.71 --> 1425.65
when you when you care a lot as a kid

1422.58 --> 1428.4099999999999
you stumble upon that lack of wisdom a

1425.65 --> 1431.89
lot because you wanna do it right you

1428.41 --> 1435.46
wanna and you can't because the freaking

1431.89 --> 1438.97
wisdom is you can't touch it you're

1435.46 --> 1441.67
forced to make these stupid mistakes to

1438.97 --> 1443.6200000000001
get it you have to earn the wisdom

1441.67 --> 1447.49
basically that's what that's what it

1443.62 --> 1450.79
comes down to yeah I mean you can you

1447.49 --> 1452.95
can learn from the mistakes of other

1450.79 --> 1456.7
people if you have the opportunity to

1452.95 --> 1459.52
peek into that if you don't you're not

1456.7 --> 1461.8300000000002
going to but the Bible is full the

1459.52 --> 1464.83
scriptures are full of examples of

1461.83 --> 1469.11
situations where you can learn some

1464.83 --> 1472.33
things vicariously you know by

1469.11 --> 1476.1299999999999
observation of things and you see a lot

1472.33 --> 1479.83
of psyche in there you see a lot of

1476.13 --> 1483.0100000000002
human logic happening and some of its

1479.83 --> 1486.6599999999999
great some of its awful and it just

1483.01 --> 1492.54
gives you these insights but to actually

1486.66 --> 1495.22
experience it to to take life on and

1492.54 --> 1497.83
have to cope with those problems was

1495.22 --> 1498.8
like that simile I mentioned or the

1497.83 --> 1501.71
metaphor

1498.8 --> 1506.12
that I think it was Mark Twain that said

1501.71 --> 1508.58
a man who holds a cat by its tail will

1506.12 --> 1511.54
learn a lesson that he could never learn

1508.58 --> 1514.28
in any other way I completely concur

1511.54 --> 1517.52
there are things you have to cope with

1514.28 --> 1520.19
in your life that you would never learn

1517.52 --> 1521.84
simply by someone telling you if you

1520.19 --> 1523.46
walk out into the street with traffic

1521.84 --> 1527.72
you're gonna get hit are you gonna go

1523.46 --> 1530.03
out there and try that no you have to

1527.72 --> 1532.73
learn what the risks are but sometimes

1530.03 --> 1536.3899999999999
you're in other situations you can't see

1532.73 --> 1541.3700000000001
that far ahead you have no clue what the

1536.39 --> 1545.71
consequences might be and you're walking

1541.37 --> 1550.03
into traffic and you're gonna get hit

1545.71 --> 1553.3700000000001
but there's hope it's not the end

1550.03 --> 1555.44
there's hope and there are solutions

1553.37 --> 1557.6299999999999
there's there's there are choices

1555.44 --> 1563.78
there's there are always choices to make

1557.63 --> 1566.8700000000001
and after a few times of going around

1563.78 --> 1570.44
this merry-go-round you start to catch

1566.87 --> 1581.6
on you know don't give up tomorrow's

1570.44 --> 1585.47
another day and today today's now last

1581.6 --> 1588.26
minute is already gone time is flown and

1585.47 --> 1591.65
you can't get it back so let's live

1588.26 --> 1594.68
every moment to its fullest let's take

1591.65 --> 1600.89
advantage of every moment we have to do

1594.68 --> 1604.1200000000001
something good with it that could

1600.89 --> 1605.2700000000002
include venting it can include

1604.12 --> 1610.36
decompressing

1605.27 --> 1615.82
they can include creativity and outlets

1610.36 --> 1620.33
like ISA always says art music is such a

1615.82 --> 1624.77
freeing expression where we can focus

1620.33 --> 1628.6399999999999
our experiences and our thoughts and our

1624.77 --> 1633.34
hopes and our dreams to where it

1628.64 --> 1639.5
relieves write and captures

1633.34 --> 1642.26
it lifts you up on wings like something

1639.5 --> 1647.83
else can't just reading a book doesn't

1642.26 --> 1651.83
exactly inspire you unless the words are

1647.83 --> 1659.1799999999998
giving you hope and a song can bring you

1651.83 --> 1663.22
hope with the sound of the movie or the

1659.18 --> 1665.9
words so I'm just gonna do many things

1663.22 --> 1667.82
yeah they couldn't want you in your

1665.9 --> 1670.5800000000002
feelings and they touch you in your

1667.82 --> 1672.82
thoughts and it all depends on how it's

1670.58 --> 1672.82
designed

1672.88 --> 1681.3200000000002
it may resonate yeah it can also in the

1677.45 --> 1684.32
combination that you are in in a moment

1681.32 --> 1686.54
yeah other moments it the same song you

1684.32 --> 1688.6699999999998
you won't even hear it's there because

1686.54 --> 1691.22
you're totally somewhere else with your

1688.67 --> 1692.23
heart and your mind it's it's all how

1691.22 --> 1697.88
that works

1692.23 --> 1705.56
yeah but in a very real way every

1697.88 --> 1708.7
individual is also a melody and I know

1705.56 --> 1711.4099999999999
that when I talk with you you're hearing

1708.7 --> 1714.8
not just my words but you're hearing my

1711.41 --> 1717.5900000000001
soul and your even though we're so many

1714.8 --> 1720.8899999999999
thousands of miles apart you're getting

1717.59 --> 1726.3999999999999
a vibration from me and I'm getting

1720.89 --> 1726.4
yours I'm I'm able to sense yours and

1726.76 --> 1735.52
it's empowering and it's encouraging

1731.02 --> 1738.65
that that can be used to build something

1735.52 --> 1743.57
solid in the spiritual realm and the

1738.65 --> 1744.89
emotional realm that a doctor can't make

1743.57 --> 1747.08
happen

1744.89 --> 1751.67
a psychologist can't make happen that

1747.08 --> 1755.87
that is human and it is god-given in my

1751.67 --> 1758.27
view and it is amazing it is on with so

1755.87 --> 1762.08
many things it's really friendship and

1758.27 --> 1763.83
just deed yes the spirit of others and

1762.08 --> 1768.09
their choices

1763.83 --> 1769.02
do the real healing mm-hmm yeah that's

1768.09 --> 1771.1499999999999
what we're here for

1769.02 --> 1774.24
doctor is just others so many other

1771.15 --> 1777.0300000000002
industry almost you know yes they happen

1774.24 --> 1780.54
to be really good healers besides also

1777.03 --> 1784.92
being a doctor yeah but a real person

1780.54 --> 1787.56
can just choose like like yeah I like I

1784.92 --> 1791.01
like this or I think I can help and just

1787.56 --> 1803.9099999999999
be nice and yeah yesterday like a lot of

1791.01 --> 1806.94
people even a lot of people do that they

1803.91 --> 1809.0700000000002
see like you need help and that's not

1806.94 --> 1811.53
what you need I hope you're in seeing

1809.07 --> 1813.8999999999999
but no you're in distress I I am

1811.53 --> 1818.07
compelled from the inside to reach out

1813.9 --> 1820.3200000000002
and try to give you some hope that's

1818.07 --> 1824.73
exactly what that was and I saw it you

1820.32 --> 1826.11
guys I saw it from from ISA and from the

1824.73 --> 1828.0
other guy and even though I was

1826.11 --> 1832.02
basically shouting at either like no I

1828.0 --> 1835.11
can't see it shut up I do get it it was

1832.02 --> 1837.24
just off timed it was like too far ahead

1835.11 --> 1843.12
for me at the time I was too in the

1837.24 --> 1845.61
middle of that that place to go there

1843.12 --> 1847.9499999999998
yet like get back at me

1845.61 --> 1849.54
like in a week time that kind of thing

1847.95 --> 1852.51
you know then I'll be ready for those

1849.54 --> 1854.46
type of suggestions but right now but

1852.51 --> 1857.39
yeah for anyone out there look I'm

1854.46 --> 1860.3700000000001
already doing so much better right now

1857.39 --> 1862.44
there's gonna be no rage outbursts today

1860.37 --> 1863.1
absolutely it's probably not in a long

1862.44 --> 1867.3300000000002
time

1863.1 --> 1870.3
I hope unless the world is suddenly

1867.33 --> 1874.5
turned upside down in a very scary way

1870.3 --> 1878.34
or whatever but I got out of the valley

1874.5 --> 1881.52
and now I'm just slowly climbing up the

1878.34 --> 1883.59
hill again and I'm ready I've built like

1881.52 --> 1886.61
my god I'm so happy I can do this

1883.59 --> 1886.61
finally I can finally

1887.95 --> 1893.779
it's when you walk downhill and there's

1891.259 --> 1896.809
nowhere else to go that's really a

1893.779 --> 1899.539
terrifying thing it is it feels like

1896.809 --> 1900.979
you're walking into hell it's a

1899.539 --> 1902.809
sensation it's not literally what

1900.979 --> 1904.5800000000002
happens just feels like you know you're

1902.809 --> 1906.219
going to a terrible place and there's no

1904.58 --> 1911.1789999999999
way around it

1906.219 --> 1913.19
but the real hope is that you know that

1911.179 --> 1916.429
it is a valley and it's not just an

1913.19 --> 1919.1290000000001
abyss and so I know like yeah I will be

1916.429 --> 1922.3690000000001
through that terrible time and then I

1919.129 --> 1927.379
know how men no matter how long it it

1922.369 --> 1929.6899999999998
seems to you that it can take or how

1927.379 --> 1932.2099999999998
what you're feeling start to paint these

1929.69 --> 1933.769
in crazy illusions of how reality is

1932.21 --> 1936.039
supposed to be it is all terrible

1933.769 --> 1938.479
never-ending in all that [ __ ] I know

1936.039 --> 1940.729
mentally and my mental faculties are not

1938.479 --> 1944.779
turn off it's just my emotions are too

1940.729 --> 1947.269
strong and I know I will get out of it

1944.779 --> 1950.57
and that always carries me through it

1947.269 --> 1953.119
that prevents me from going mentally out

1950.57 --> 1954.589
of control and it's very interesting

1953.119 --> 1958.1589999999999
because I've had very weird

1954.589 --> 1961.629
circumstances in similar depression-like

1958.159 --> 1966.6090000000002
moments where I will be completely

1961.629 --> 1969.559
physically ill from the pain but I would

1966.609 --> 1972.769
it's even a bad thing to sketch out but

1969.559 --> 1975.529
like I would be so violently physically

1972.769 --> 1976.849
hurt by my sensations the doctors are

1975.529 --> 1979.009
like almost like oh my god you need

1976.849 --> 1982.309
medication this looks completely insane

1979.009 --> 1986.089
you're almost literally lying on the

1982.309 --> 1987.95
doctor's floor drooling that kind of

1986.089 --> 1990.499
[ __ ] sounds really creepy but no

1987.95 --> 1993.1390000000001
medication whatsoever nothing is just a

1990.499 --> 1995.769
pure pain sensation but in that

1993.139 --> 1999.529
sensation I would be able to explain

1995.769 --> 2002.289
with great clarity to the doctor exactly

1999.529 --> 2004.299
what was happening in me while it was

2002.289 --> 2006.609
happening and that is something else I

2004.299 --> 2008.9089999999999
don't know how many other people have

2006.609 --> 2012.98
that but I have that my mental faculties

2008.909 --> 2015.74
always always stay no matter

2012.98 --> 2018.559
to what my emotions and everything else

2015.74 --> 2020.75
goes through and it's never a curse

2018.559 --> 2023.389
because it's always like a guiding

2020.75 --> 2025.49
parent to me like the child goes berserk

2023.389 --> 2030.1
but there's always the parent like who

2025.49 --> 2035.09
knows who just knows it's always there

2030.1 --> 2037.4599999999998
I'm very thankful for for my Creator or

2035.09 --> 2040.4599999999998
whoever is responsible for me to

2037.46 --> 2043.159
function that way that I have that

2040.46 --> 2046.45
because I don't know what I would do

2043.159 --> 2053.03
with my life if I wouldn't I echo that

2046.45 --> 2060.05
in my lifetime always seeing I seem to

2053.03 --> 2066.679
have always been aware my child was

2060.05 --> 2070.94
aware so when we talk about it I asked

2066.679 --> 2074.179
her do you still sense that she says in

2070.94 --> 2080.929
a way yes but she's having to learn for

2074.179 --> 2082.669
herself where to go you know she knows

2080.929 --> 2087.889
she can talk to me anytime

2082.669 --> 2091.8489999999997
I don't and and I'm not perfect if

2087.889 --> 2094.369
there's such a thing which even she says

2091.849 --> 2097.1600000000003
mom when when I sense that you're not

2094.369 --> 2101.4500000000003
understanding me or that you're going

2097.16 --> 2103.3999999999996
that way with what I'm saying I bring

2101.45 --> 2106.43
you back and I show you what I actually

2103.4 --> 2110.15
mean so she also has the ability to it

2106.43 --> 2113.8999999999996
to express herself she's very sensitive

2110.15 --> 2119.39
like you and like me but she knows how

2113.9 --> 2123.05
to curb it she knows how to and we don't

2119.39 --> 2126.2599999999998
compartmentalize anymore she she went

2123.05 --> 2128.9300000000003
through a situation that she held back

2126.26 --> 2133.25
from me until she felt confident to

2128.93 --> 2135.6189999999997
discuss it and and I was like I can't

2133.25 --> 2136.91
believe I didn't see that I knew you

2135.619 --> 2139.1600000000003
were struggling with something but I

2136.91 --> 2145.04
thought it was just schoolwork yeah you

2139.16 --> 2145.3999999999996
know and when I hide things from their

2145.04 --> 2149.12
parent

2145.4 --> 2151.73
they will do it so meticulously and I

2149.12 --> 2153.92
did that [ __ ] okay and I have a very

2151.73 --> 2157.1
clear-cut example that was revealed to

2153.92 --> 2160.91
me pretty early on even like the over a

2157.1 --> 2163.79
decade ago and that is that I pretended

2160.91 --> 2167.17
at home that everything was alright at

2163.79 --> 2170.87
school while I was being savagely

2167.17 --> 2174.01
savagely bullied almost physical

2170.87 --> 2177.47
violence level but mentally savage

2174.01 --> 2182.69
savage annoyed on a daily basis for

2177.47 --> 2184.52
years and I wouldn't talk about it they

2182.69 --> 2190.21
would see I would be distressed but I

2184.52 --> 2194.93
was just like no I like I can't handle

2190.21 --> 2198.11
the real yeah like it was like no my

2194.93 --> 2201.29
family is my safe space I can't throw

2198.11 --> 2203.2400000000002
this [ __ ] in there or I won't have my

2201.29 --> 2208.1
calm place anymore and that was kind of

2203.24 --> 2211.1899999999996
why I did it I think because it was just

2208.1 --> 2213.5899999999997
so much and I didn't want to throw it I

2211.19 --> 2216.85
didn't want my parents to get involved

2213.59 --> 2221.0
it was it's it's a very strange child

2216.85 --> 2227.7799999999997
way of reasoning I guess but that

2221.0 --> 2232.19
happened I just you um like how was

2227.78 --> 2234.26
school and I would always it was fine

2232.19 --> 2236.87
and it would obviously no it's not fine

2234.26 --> 2239.4100000000003
but because see it's not fine but why

2236.87 --> 2242.0899999999997
won't you just say what's gonna I don't

2239.41 --> 2246.44
I just don't want to talk about it I

2242.09 --> 2249.83
can't no it's too much and I did

2246.44 --> 2251.33
eventually sort of but then as I

2249.83 --> 2252.74
explained things and I can barely

2251.33 --> 2254.2999999999997
remember it because yeah that's like

2252.74 --> 2256.7799999999997
again almost like yesterday it's

2254.3 --> 2260.42
breaking through of that pain and [ __ ]

2256.78 --> 2261.98
they knew like oh [ __ ] he's in a lot of

2260.42 --> 2265.61
trouble and there's really nothing we

2261.98 --> 2267.65
can do about it because yeah if you're

2265.61 --> 2270.1400000000003
gonna take him away from that school

2267.65 --> 2272.63
it's probably something similar is gonna

2270.14 --> 2275.93
start over again it's it's become a part

2272.63 --> 2277.02
of a process to him to me to go through

2275.93 --> 2280.81
that and

2277.02 --> 2283.27
somehow try to work through it so it was

2280.81 --> 2285.369
my challenge I guess even though I

2283.27 --> 2290.16
thought I couldn't handle it really and

2285.369 --> 2290.1600000000003
they understood that eventually it's

2292.14 --> 2301.7799999999997
yeah there were depths I'm sure that you

2296.109 --> 2303.73
were seeing I mean I do you're just here

2301.78 --> 2306.82
what's problem I got that black sheep

2303.73 --> 2314.32
basically you know I got no floor their

2306.82 --> 2316.78
enemy you know they say it's a good

2314.32 --> 2321.31
thing to have a diary to write things

2316.78 --> 2323.6800000000003
out because it it helps you to review

2321.31 --> 2326.23
your life later on and go what was I

2323.68 --> 2328.99
going through it this time and and how

2326.23 --> 2331.9
was I seeing it because eventually your

2328.99 --> 2337.6899999999996
perspective changes as you you know you

2331.9 --> 2339.76
grow you get elevated semi-dry word you

2337.69 --> 2342.16
grow up and you're able to see things

2339.76 --> 2344.65
from a different perspective and you

2342.16 --> 2347.0499999999997
know another cycle of it and you sit

2344.65 --> 2348.94
there going this sounds familiar but at

2347.05 --> 2352.119
the same time I'm on a different level

2348.94 --> 2355.0
of it so it's a constant learning

2352.119 --> 2359.55
process and I like being able to go back

2355.0 --> 2364.21
and review so when you get a flashback

2359.55 --> 2367.119
when I get a flashback I I immediately

2364.21 --> 2375.94
get the crosshairs on it and I'm start I

2367.119 --> 2377.98
start analyzing myself you know and and

2375.94 --> 2380.92
greater understanding comes from it

2377.98 --> 2384.16
there there's a benefit of breaking

2380.92 --> 2388.8
things down and understanding how how

2384.16 --> 2393.19
they work of mechanism works you know

2388.8 --> 2396.13
there's scientific experimentation in

2393.19 --> 2398.7400000000002
all kinds of situations of your life

2396.13 --> 2400.839
and that's what our met was find out

2398.74 --> 2404.9199999999996
what those variables are what is your

2400.839 --> 2409.39
constant right what can you manipulate

2404.92 --> 2410.71
what can you change if you want change

2409.39 --> 2412.48
in your life if you're going

2410.71 --> 2414.339
keep doing the same stuff over and over

2412.48 --> 2416.23
again you're not going to experience

2414.339 --> 2419.89
change you're just gonna experience a

2416.23 --> 2423.4
deeper rut from walk in that same circle

2419.89 --> 2427.15
it's just it's that is that is

2423.4 --> 2429.76
observation that's experience and that's

2427.15 --> 2431.4700000000003
that's a kind of wisdom but it's yeah

2429.76 --> 2433.2400000000002
the only thing that's gonna happen from

2431.47 --> 2434.83
walking the same circle over and over

2433.24 --> 2438.4599999999996
again is that that circle is gonna be

2434.83 --> 2446.44
engraved in much it's going to be harder

2438.46 --> 2448.3
to to move out of it and you end up

2446.44 --> 2449.4900000000002
convincing yourself that this is all

2448.3 --> 2452.6800000000003
there is to life

2449.49 --> 2455.4399999999996
therefore I might as well do something

2452.68 --> 2459.97
that's gonna bring me pleasure whatever

2455.44 --> 2461.349
that may be or I mean you might take it

2459.97 --> 2464.14
to a good side or you might go to bed

2461.349 --> 2468.07
you might go nothing matters anymore so

2464.14 --> 2471.21
I'll do whatever and you know it could

2468.07 --> 2471.21
get pretty bad pretty quickly

2472.109 --> 2485.89
I mean alcoholism drug addiction all

2479.2 --> 2488.89
kinds of social addictions and the list

2485.89 --> 2491.23
is long people it's longer than my arm

2488.89 --> 2493.7799999999997
and I don't I'm not saying that I had

2491.23 --> 2497.02
experimented with everything in fact

2493.78 --> 2501.25
I've led a very sheltered life but I can

2497.02 --> 2504.88
see I see people suffering and it it

2501.25 --> 2507.91
hurts so deeply it I understand Darwin

2504.88 --> 2512.38
because I'm also sensitive and I care

2507.91 --> 2517.18
I can feel people's pain and I can point

2512.38 --> 2520.7200000000003
out things to them that I see our cents

2517.18 --> 2523.39
are the wound and I know it's gonna hurt

2520.72 --> 2528.8489999999997
to look at it because it's an open wound

2523.39 --> 2535.7799999999997
and everyone needs a safe place

2528.849 --> 2542.2000000000003
everyone needs a valley a time a shadow

2535.78 --> 2543.1800000000003
a fortress a a lap a hug everyone needs

2542.2 --> 2547.4399999999996
to have that

2543.18 --> 2549.74
place and the moral support to go to

2547.44 --> 2555.44
true friendship

2549.74 --> 2558.99
true friendship that is constructive and

2555.44 --> 2562.92
inspiring and just sitting there and

2558.99 --> 2566.6699999999996
listening and not judging and ridiculing

2562.92 --> 2569.309
and poking fun at knowing when to talk

2566.67 --> 2572.2490000000003
and when to shut up and listen and just

2569.309 --> 2575.1600000000003
nod just be there for someone and have

2572.249 --> 2579.749
that done for you you you come to

2575.16 --> 2583.019
appreciate it you come to appreciate it

2579.749 --> 2586.68
and you understand I'm not here to talk

2583.019 --> 2591.8689999999997
to I'm here to listen and that you yes

2586.68 --> 2595.279
it allows the person to get the healing

2591.869 --> 2599.4500000000003
reactions going the the emotional

2595.279 --> 2603.839
talking things out helps a person

2599.45 --> 2606.48
distill or define what the need is what

2603.839 --> 2613.14
is the problem what is the need are we

2606.48 --> 2619.5190000000002
gonna fix this and the hue the capacity

2613.14 --> 2623.46
of a human to do that that cognitive

2619.519 --> 2625.3489999999997
self-examination and other examination

2623.46 --> 2630.95
you know observation of others and

2625.349 --> 2635.489
coming to logical conclusions and

2630.95 --> 2638.8799999999997
solutions for individuals that then

2635.489 --> 2640.109
apply also to all of humanity isn't that

2638.88 --> 2642.319
what life is all about

2640.109 --> 2645.269
isn't that what individual

2642.319 --> 2648.739
responsibility and accountability is all

2645.269 --> 2653.3089999999997
about and progressing moving forward

2648.739 --> 2658.0190000000002
growing up maturing finding wisdom and

2653.309 --> 2663.809
using it and teaching others sharing

2658.019 --> 2667.68
being there for others it's it's organic

2663.809 --> 2670.92
it's it's an organ it is a body it is

2667.68 --> 2674.19
all connected or how many times do we

2670.92 --> 2676.289
have to say it we're all connected when

2674.19 --> 2677.01
there's an infection the body's going to

2676.289 --> 2683.69
react

2677.01 --> 2686.5800000000004
way it's going to call in the troops and

2683.69 --> 2689.01
circle that thing and surrounded and

2686.58 --> 2692.58
encapsulated and seek to eliminate it

2689.01 --> 2704.3100000000004
from the body it's self-preservation it

2692.58 --> 2705.93
is survival mode at that point I started

2704.31 --> 2708.09
to break your flow because it's really

2705.93 --> 2710.37
good but yeah I got a super chat from

2708.09 --> 2714.15
the mind of God so awesome

2710.37 --> 2717.39
yeah and he says you've brought people

2714.15 --> 2719.85
intellectual stimulation through your

2717.39 --> 2720.8399999999997
analysis peace thank you when you

2719.85 --> 2723.2999999999997
appreciate it

2720.84 --> 2728.6600000000003
I almost thought it was intellectual

2723.3 --> 2728.6600000000003
simulation there that's almost the same

2728.78 --> 2733.3700000000003
but thank you

2737.06 --> 2744.96
seriously like in I'm enjoying what you

2742.8 --> 2746.76
do here on my show so much that I'm

2744.96 --> 2748.35
actually having trouble listening to

2746.76 --> 2750.75
what you're saying it's so weird but

2748.35 --> 2753.69
it's stealing so much I'm gonna actually

2750.75 --> 2756.06
have to watch the show back to figure

2753.69 --> 2766.35
out what you were actually saying but

2756.06 --> 2771.2999999999997
it's feeling so good it's all it really

2766.35 --> 2776.2799999999997
is just the solution to depression to

2771.3 --> 2779.8500000000004
pain is is kinship and understanding and

2776.28 --> 2783.96
just coming together forming a wider

2779.85 --> 2787.7999999999997
circle and letting all that energy go

2783.96 --> 2790.14
around and you you well alone you could

2787.8 --> 2795.9300000000003
never be in that energy that heals you

2790.14 --> 2798.3199999999997
it's like that's a mechanism and it's

2795.93 --> 2801.6299999999997
supposed to be there it is probably a

2798.32 --> 2805.59
family mechanism it is probably the only

2801.63 --> 2807.81
way people that have depression can

2805.59 --> 2811.9500000000003
really get through it properly with

2807.81 --> 2816.18
family and it's probably also why why do

2811.95 --> 2820.4399999999996
evil ones attack the family unit take

2816.18 --> 2822.6299999999997
that away so people can't get out of it

2820.44 --> 2826.82
and they will eventually destroy

2822.63 --> 2826.82
themselves through medication and [ __ ]

2827.9 --> 2835.83
depression can be described as being in

2831.69 --> 2838.4700000000003
a tunnel with no light not knowing which

2835.83 --> 2844.7999999999997
direction to go in order to find the way

2838.47 --> 2847.4599999999996
out that and and when you start

2844.8 --> 2850.2000000000003
second-guessing yourself and trying to

2847.46 --> 2852.3
double back maybe I should be going the

2850.2 --> 2855.6299999999997
other way and you end up you know in the

2852.3 --> 2857.67
in this back and forth not knowing when

2855.63 --> 2859.56
when do you see the light at the end of

2857.67 --> 2862.8
the tunnel when you see that one ray of

2859.56 --> 2866.13
light and that's the good a hole

2862.8 --> 2868.52
somewhere yeah usually another person

2866.13 --> 2872.359
another person reaching out its

2868.52 --> 2875.93
another person reaching out it's almost

2872.359 --> 2879.65
like God reaching out the late array of

2875.93 --> 2882.68
light that is what really that's what

2879.65 --> 2887.21
you need it's just little help that is

2882.68 --> 2889.7
when your hope becomes reality because

2887.21 --> 2895.63
now you've got something to hope for

2889.7 --> 2898.5499999999997
you know well you can hope for light but

2895.63 --> 2902.06
when you see that ray of light now your

2898.55 --> 2903.92
faith has been you know your faith has

2902.06 --> 2906.38
been renewed and you're not unit you you

2903.92 --> 2908.75
have a direction you have confirmation

2906.38 --> 2912.2000000000003
that's the way out so you go that way

2908.75 --> 2915.74
but in the darkness while you're in the

2912.2 --> 2919.1299999999997
valley there's someone with you you're

2915.74 --> 2922.4599999999996
never alone and sometimes you might hear

2919.13 --> 2926.2400000000002
of a voice of reason sometimes you might

2922.46 --> 2929.75
hear a voice of destruction and you need

2926.24 --> 2934.5499999999997
to tune in you need to you know choose

2929.75 --> 2935.45
who you gonna listen to and that's the

2934.55 --> 2941.1400000000003
tough one

2935.45 --> 2941.14
that's the hardest yeah

2945.96 --> 2958.23
I need a smoke break Oh how long have we

2953.31 --> 2961.92
been going uh see quite some time not an

2958.23 --> 2966.75
hour yeah you have 48 minutes see I lose

2961.92 --> 2972.75
track of time I can't tell that's great

2966.75 --> 2975.26
I found and I've discussed this with you

2972.75 --> 2982.58
to Arbonne and I wanted to share with

2975.26 --> 2987.42
folks that listen that as a result of

2982.58 --> 2994.0499999999997
going through a process at least one

2987.42 --> 2997.88
cycle maybe maybe more I had observed in

2994.05 --> 3001.67
in the scriptures how they would raise

2997.88 --> 3004.1
after going through a trial or a period

3001.67 --> 3010.51
of testing there would be an altar

3004.1 --> 3012.98
raised for a reason or a memorial and I

3010.51 --> 3015.2900000000004
wanted to know what what that meant

3012.98 --> 3022.82
what was it for what what's the purpose

3015.29 --> 3026.45
of all this and it came to mean a moment

3022.82 --> 3029.84
of recognition like a graduation in

3026.45 --> 3032.48
what's called a touring the passing of

3029.84 --> 3034.9700000000003
the test a victory so you're gonna

3032.48 --> 3037.67
commemorate the victory and they're

3034.97 --> 3044.6899999999996
going to memorialize it so it becomes a

3037.67 --> 3047.6
milestone in your life a marker and much

3044.69 --> 3048.82
like having a scar from a wound and

3047.6 --> 3052.1
that's been healed

3048.82 --> 3057.26
you're gonna celebrate it and every time

3052.1 --> 3059.0
you see that you're going to remember so

3057.26 --> 3061.7900000000004
that the next time you go through a

3059.0 --> 3064.99
situation you're going to remember when

3061.79 --> 3068.75
you're gonna go I have been through

3064.99 --> 3072.3199999999997
tough situations before and I'm going

3068.75 --> 3075.01
through one now and I know that there's

3072.32 --> 3078.38
a beginning a middle and an end to this

3075.01 --> 3080.9
situation this stage and I

3078.38 --> 3086.3
will come out better for it I will come

3080.9 --> 3089.15
out more mature whatever gold is in me

3086.3 --> 3094.57
will be more purified the fire will burn

3089.15 --> 3103.1
away the the dross we call it the

3094.57 --> 3107.53
impurities excuse me and so after going

3103.1 --> 3112.91
through the the depression cycle and

3107.53 --> 3117.11
battling with wanting to stop the pain

3112.91 --> 3120.14
by ending my life I suddenly it came to

3117.11 --> 3125.7200000000003
me and like you need you need a memorial

3120.14 --> 3129.0499999999997
you need something to celebrate that you

3125.72 --> 3132.41
chose life you need to celebrate this

3129.05 --> 3135.9500000000003
victory and stick it in the face of the

3132.41 --> 3139.79
darkness take that you know look at me

3135.95 --> 3144.41
how do you like me now kind of thing and

3139.79 --> 3147.32
so I came up with something it in my

3144.41 --> 3155.23
life at the time that would mean

3147.32 --> 3158.81
something to me and I was it was

3155.23 --> 3162.38
directed at the thing that was tempting

3158.81 --> 3168.14
me to end my life so it was purposeful

3162.38 --> 3170.78
and it was meaningful and let me explain

3168.14 --> 3174.77
so I lived in an area where there were

3170.78 --> 3179.9
lots of canals and draw bridges for

3174.77 --> 3183.65
boats to go under and when I'd walk past

3179.9 --> 3185.84
them with my daughter in the stroller I

3183.65 --> 3187.79
would be looking down at the water

3185.84 --> 3190.69
waiting for the job which to go down so

3187.79 --> 3194.87
I could cross over and I could

3190.69 --> 3197.33
physically sense I could physically and

3194.87 --> 3202.0099999999998
emotionally sense something was calling

3197.33 --> 3205.0099999999998
me to jump into the water and just end

3202.01 --> 3210.59
it all you know you're such a fricking

3205.01 --> 3211.88
mess why don't you just end it and and I

3210.59 --> 3216.2000000000003
have a daughter I mean I

3211.88 --> 3220.46
purposed for a lot for living I didn't I

3216.2 --> 3224.0589999999997
wasn't desperately without any

3220.46 --> 3229.609
friendships but this thing was real it

3224.059 --> 3232.759
was trying to overwhelm me and get its

3229.609 --> 3238.13
victory over me and ride and blind you

3232.759 --> 3241.039
to everything yes and and so my equal

3238.13 --> 3243.589
and opposite reaction to that was to

3241.039 --> 3245.96
every time I'd cross the drawbridge

3243.589 --> 3248.72
I would wave at the drawbridge operator

3245.96 --> 3251.359
the window and I don't know who was

3248.72 --> 3256.609
there I don't know which shifts they had

3251.359 --> 3260.089
I don't know anything I just made waved

3256.609 --> 3263.15
and I'd be jumping like trying to get

3260.089 --> 3266.299
their attention it was to say I'm here

3263.15 --> 3267.079
and when I was driving over the

3266.299 --> 3270.65
drawbridges

3267.079 --> 3275.569
I would honk my horn pop pop pop pop up

3270.65 --> 3277.9700000000003
and eventually I started noticing that

3275.569 --> 3280.22
when I talk someone would jump out of

3277.97 --> 3282.799
their seat in the in the drawbridge

3280.22 --> 3284.9599999999996
Tower and go to the window to try to see

3282.799 --> 3288.71
who it was and I'm going I'm having an

3284.96 --> 3293.15
effect and I didn't even expect that it

3288.71 --> 3296.9900000000002
was just fun for me at that point that

3293.15 --> 3299.9300000000003
I'm I'm making a ripple I'm having an

3296.99 --> 3304.16
effect someone has no clue why I'm doing

3299.93 --> 3310.0
it but they're noticing so now the

3304.16 --> 3315.68
existential part of it is I made a mark

3310.0 --> 3324.5
okay to counter the scar to celebrate

3315.68 --> 3326.779
the scar to explain the scar and those

3324.5 --> 3330.17
who have ears to hear and eyes to see

3326.779 --> 3333.95
you will understand and I hope it brings

3330.17 --> 3337.2690000000002
you something really really special

3333.95 --> 3339.8289999999997
because it will be something you will do

3337.269 --> 3342.3999999999996
that means something to you and

3339.829 --> 3345.6090000000004
eventually you'll be sharing it and

3342.4 --> 3351.2000000000003
it'll mean something that someone else

3345.609 --> 3355.839
so in my understanding in my walk I do

3351.2 --> 3360.019
an Icee I observe that nothing is

3355.839 --> 3363.739
useless everything is useful for

3360.019 --> 3367.8799999999997
learning for discipline for for training

3363.739 --> 3371.7200000000003
for bringing hope and for causing life

3367.88 --> 3376.119
to happen really living and to avoid

3371.72 --> 3380.72
traps and death and cope lessness

3376.119 --> 3389.69
so never give up never give in fight the

3380.72 --> 3393.41
darkness I want to say thanks again to

3389.69 --> 3396.559
only sheep can see for donating another

3393.41 --> 3399.5589999999997
five by the way New Zealand Dollars I

3396.559 --> 3401.6600000000003
think that's must be right and yeah

3399.559 --> 3406.329
thank you for all your support so far

3401.66 --> 3406.3289999999997
and I really really do appreciate it

3412.89 --> 3419.64
it's so weird that just a response is

3416.88 --> 3422.73
still to all this stuff yesterday and

3419.64 --> 3427.47
like oh you got more views or votes or

3422.73 --> 3429.42
it's like none of you people get it you

3427.47 --> 3436.23
just don't get what happened there it's

3429.42 --> 3440.4500000000003
it's not about any of that it was about

3436.23 --> 3444.359
what was real and that's the only thing

3440.45 --> 3447.93
to me that mattered is that it was real

3444.359 --> 3452.19
and I wasn't gonna hide it any any

3447.93 --> 3454.43
longer for myself in this case and the

3452.19 --> 3454.43
world

3455.749 --> 3461.4889999999996
it's not about view yet yeah sure you

3459.029 --> 3463.89
know truth in the world of lies yeah it

3461.489 --> 3466.14
does Ted tend to attract a lot of

3463.89 --> 3469.47
attention one way or the other that's

3466.14 --> 3473.43
not why I did it I did it because it was

3469.47 --> 3476.609
inevitable and because I couldn't stop

3473.43 --> 3481.769
it and I feel like I needed to do that

3476.609 --> 3483.589
and and even now I I don't I'm not

3481.769 --> 3487.3799999999997
taking it back

3483.589 --> 3490.859
I'm not apologizing and I'm not

3487.38 --> 3495.15
retracting including the murders part

3490.859 --> 3500.069
all that it it was real not doing it

3495.15 --> 3502.4990000000003
okay but that that feeling that need and

3500.069 --> 3508.44
I'm not the only one that was real and

3502.499 --> 3509.5789999999997
I'm not apologizing to anyone ever you

3508.44 --> 3516.539
have a problem with it

3509.579 --> 3520.549
come and get me it was real I meant it

3516.539 --> 3523.2000000000003
and what I predicted I think will happen

3520.549 --> 3526.94
if nothing else is done about it

3523.2 --> 3526.9399999999996
and that's just what it is

3533.96 --> 3539.01
and yeah again just

3536.7 --> 3544.6499999999996
ready explain so many times to people

3539.01 --> 3547.7400000000002
like I am almost entirely incapable of

3544.65 --> 3551.94
hurting anything I can't even kill a fly

3547.74 --> 3554.8489999999997
I have to catch it so I can release it I

3551.94 --> 3558.48
don't hurt things I can't stand it but

3554.849 --> 3562.559
this is something else this is this is

3558.48 --> 3566.5190000000002
just beyond that and that's it's also

3562.559 --> 3570.9300000000003
there it's even the most peaceful person

3566.519 --> 3576.75
has a war machine hidden deep inside of

3570.93 --> 3580.1699999999996
them I think I know I do when I'm in

3576.75 --> 3585.089
battle mode I don't I can't say I

3580.17 --> 3594.15
expressed it like you do I I like my

3585.089 --> 3598.41
singing voice and I find my way right my

3594.15 --> 3604.2000000000003
way of expressing and putting into my my

3598.41 --> 3606.259
area my I hate to call it atmosphere oh

3604.2 --> 3610.5789999999997
my goodness

3606.259 --> 3613.109
my space that's even worse

3610.579 --> 3618.2400000000002
area of it yeah there we go

3613.109 --> 3625.17
my area of influence I I just find it

3618.24 --> 3629.1899999999996
very positive and productive in a good

3625.17 --> 3638.9700000000003
way to produce good things by spilling

3629.19 --> 3642.89
out music joy peace and celebration into

3638.97 --> 3645.299
my area of influence and yesterday I was

3642.89 --> 3650.1299999999997
thinking about things Arwen and I

3645.299 --> 3652.529
remembered again I keep turning back to

3650.13 --> 3654.869
Scripture please forgive me a few guys

3652.529 --> 3658.589
no problem at all don't like it but I

3654.869 --> 3661.9500000000003
find these things to be true that the

3658.589 --> 3665.43
way into the presence it is written come

3661.95 --> 3668.21
into his courts with Thanksgiving you

3665.43 --> 3670.5299999999997
know come into his presence with

3668.21 --> 3673.17
Thanksgiving and into the

3670.53 --> 3675.4500000000003
courts with praise and I'm I keep I go

3673.17 --> 3679.71
what does that mean how does that work

3675.45 --> 3688.89
and he shows me I get visuals and then I

3679.71 --> 3690.03
do it and I I know he's there it it's

3688.89 --> 3692.6099999999997
awesome

3690.03 --> 3695.82
it is amazing school you can in the

3692.61 --> 3698.4
whole being so to me it's the

3695.82 --> 3703.3500000000004
realization there really is a cohesion

3698.4 --> 3706.59
in in the all the the it is not just a

3703.35 --> 3709.44
building I'm not talking about churches

3706.59 --> 3712.71
like the building we are individuals in

3709.44 --> 3714.78
our consciousness and we are sitting on

3712.71 --> 3717.87
all this complicated stuff the

3714.78 --> 3721.6200000000003
biochemistry to psychology the looks

3717.87 --> 3726.44
culture all that but it is a consistent

3721.62 --> 3731.3399999999997
whole and so the same way is the Creator

3726.44 --> 3734.7200000000003
may consistent whole in all things you

3731.34 --> 3741.8
know and it is with our spirit we can

3734.72 --> 3747.6899999999996
actually get that you can touch it you

3741.8 --> 3751.8500000000004
can touch the that it is a being yeah

3747.69 --> 3755.34
once you realize once you you get that

3751.85 --> 3758.0699999999997
you know that this place has had to have

3755.34 --> 3762.7400000000002
been created it's so intelligent that we

3758.07 --> 3767.3
are created then it begs the question

3762.74 --> 3770.7799999999997
what are we here for why are we here

3767.3 --> 3774.6600000000003
what's the point of it all and as as you

3770.78 --> 3777.9300000000003
walk out that search but and what I mean

3774.66 --> 3784.92
is I'm so aware of the presence of this

3777.93 --> 3786.06
being in my life and so to to come into

3784.92 --> 3789.84
his presence

3786.06 --> 3793.2799999999997
am I ever out of his presence no he's

3789.84 --> 3797.6400000000003
seeing me all the time but am i

3793.28 --> 3800.3700000000003
consciously acknowledging him am i

3797.64 --> 3804.24
consciously focusing on him all the time

3800.37 --> 3809.3689999999997
no so to come into its

3804.24 --> 3813.18
it's a choice an act of my my person my

3809.369 --> 3815.579
individuality towards him it's facing

3813.18 --> 3819.569
him it's it's looking at him it's

3815.579 --> 3823.069
beholding him how can I behold him I can

3819.569 --> 3828.18
behold him by observing creation and I

3823.069 --> 3834.54
can I can speak to him and I can listen

3828.18 --> 3838.7999999999997
I can just be quiet be still and into

3834.54 --> 3841.38
his courts with praise okay so to enter

3838.8 --> 3843.71
into his presence it's the path it's

3841.38 --> 3848.4900000000002
Thanksgiving so when I'm giving thanks

3843.71 --> 3851.64
to my Creator for things I perceive that

3848.49 --> 3856.29
he has done that he has given me that he

3851.64 --> 3860.8799999999997
is for me that he loves me and that he

3856.29 --> 3863.97
wants me right and he wants the best for

3860.88 --> 3868.579
me and he wants me to be to become the

3863.97 --> 3868.5789999999997
best that I can be not the army folks

3869.359 --> 3879.27
his army yes but not not this military

3873.72 --> 3882.0789999999997
down here is crazy and into his courts

3879.27 --> 3885.39
with praise when I'm praising him for

3882.079 --> 3892.65
things he does and things I've received

3885.39 --> 3894.0
and to be or characteristics and giving

3892.65 --> 3897.059
him worth you know

3894.0 --> 3901.97
worship is worth ship it's giving it's

3897.059 --> 3901.9700000000003
acknowledging his Worth his worthiness

3904.4 --> 3911.75
amazing things happen and you become

3907.95 --> 3918.6299999999997
that more balanced more centered more

3911.75 --> 3922.5
effective and productive is the I guess

3918.63 --> 3924.63
the best way I can put it yeah yeah you

3922.5 --> 3928.21
don't get so preoccupied your

3924.63 --> 3930.609
preoccupation lessons

3928.21 --> 3935.02
and when I was less about damage control

3930.609 --> 3938.49
and actually more about the wall

3935.02 --> 3941.95
expanding you call it or just building

3938.49 --> 3944.74
build using yeah because what are we

3941.95 --> 3948.9399999999996
what are we building indeed what are we

3944.74 --> 3954.3999999999996
building and another thing was about the

3948.94 --> 3956.559
caring are when we we don't want to

3954.4 --> 3957.67
sacrifice the caring we don't want to

3956.559 --> 3962.02
stop caring

3957.67 --> 3967.809
I noticed early on that I didn't want to

3962.02 --> 3970.78
become jaded or in a sensitive it you

3967.809 --> 3973.9900000000002
know if a cost of not feeling pain meant

3970.78 --> 3976.3
that I had to stop caring I rejected

3973.99 --> 3980.4399999999996
that with all my being I was like that's

3976.3 --> 3982.96
not a solution that's that kills myself

3980.44 --> 3988.42
that kills a part of me that is

3982.96 --> 3991.839
connected to my maker part of you that

3988.42 --> 3995.6800000000003
made it all made sense yeah you don't

3991.839 --> 3999.2799999999997
have that then there is nothing care is

3995.68 --> 4001.2599999999998
really in the decor fee only care and

3999.28 --> 4004.46
nothing is it literally it's so obvious

4001.26 --> 4009.3590000000004
if you don't care then nothing matters

4004.46 --> 4012.299
exactly and that is death that is death

4009.359 --> 4016.95
to your soul as sure as sure can be and

4012.299 --> 4019.5
the acts of not caring of it not

4016.95 --> 4022.2
mattering will spring forth the chaos

4019.5 --> 4024.319
from that and the destruction it that's

4022.2 --> 4027.3289999999997
just how it works

4024.319 --> 4030.21
the opposite of doing good by not caring

4027.329 --> 4032.7000000000003
you can't do good by not caring it's

4030.21 --> 4035.369
impossible the opposite of hatred isn't

4032.7 --> 4038.91
love the opposite of hatred is not

4035.369 --> 4044.15
caring it is apathy hatred is just

4038.91 --> 4044.1499999999996
another function of love yeah I just say

4044.839 --> 4053.45
hatred yes I love an answer

4047.849 --> 4061.32
yes burns yes

4053.45 --> 4067.7999999999997
so heavy stuff but at the same time it

4061.32 --> 4075.9300000000003
gives one wings yes this we're giving

4067.8 --> 4079.4700000000003
flying lessons yeah so we're just

4075.93 --> 4083.52
looking in jet right now because yeah I

4079.47 --> 4086.85
am subjecting my public to a whole

4083.52 --> 4088.77
nother level of thing of energy and they

4086.85 --> 4091.16
are all having their own weird little

4088.77 --> 4094.05
response is almost fascinating to see

4091.16 --> 4095.67
yeah that some people are like what's

4094.05 --> 4098.66
going on what's going on and others

4095.67 --> 4103.14
really get it and it's just so obvious

4098.66 --> 4105.299
you know I see you sorry and it's

4103.14 --> 4108.87
alright you know as long as you don't

4105.299 --> 4112.98
get evil and destructive and there's oh

4108.87 --> 4115.259
my god I've had a comment I I had a

4112.98 --> 4117.509
comment you remember which one I'm

4115.259 --> 4120.87
talking about right yes I showed it to

4117.509 --> 4123.47
Nathan as well mm-hmm that's what I

4120.87 --> 4127.92
didn't creepiest comments I've ever read

4123.47 --> 4129.509
did he respond I don't know I deleted it

4127.92 --> 4131.91
all it's like oh okay

4129.509 --> 4134.31
no I mean you showed him inning Nathan

4131.91 --> 4137.7
yeah one day what did he say again oh

4134.31 --> 4142.049
yeah that's what he said

4137.7 --> 4150.0199999999995
well what else is there to say what's so

4142.049 --> 4150.0199999999995
vile so hey this constant dropped off

4161.549 --> 4167.609
must be our internet or a battery or

4163.769 --> 4174.63
something maybe I should be rounding out

4167.609 --> 4175.079000000001
the show let's see maybe she'll come

4174.63 --> 4177.2390000000005
back

4175.079 --> 4181.009
or maybe I will indeed round out the

4177.239 --> 4184.079
show it's too bad it's a bit sudden

4181.009 --> 4188.19
let's see how long have I been going

4184.079 --> 4192.0289999999995
oh yeah 69 minutes okay i'll round out

4188.19 --> 4195.239
the show I guess yeah I am doing better

4192.029 --> 4197.639
than yesterday blatantly obvious it's

4195.239 --> 4200.879999999999
not much much hard not very hard to do

4197.639 --> 4205.59
feel better than yesterday and though

4200.88 --> 4207.57
I'm not like top of the world yeah the

4205.59 --> 4210.059
pendulum doesn't swing that quickly

4207.57 --> 4214.789
thank God things would explode if they

4210.059 --> 4214.789
if it did it's not good so

4215.52 --> 4218.660000000001
yeah I hope

4219.769 --> 4224.719
yeah exactly Constance is back in chat

4222.829 --> 4226.969
and their battery died indeed oh well

4224.719 --> 4235.4800000000005
well thank you so much for coming

4226.969 --> 4238.969
Constance it's been a great support and

4235.48 --> 4241.94
yeah I will be back tomorrow again with

4238.969 --> 4246.65
flattered the earlybird number forty 84

4241.94 --> 4249.428999999999
and yeah if you like this video please

4246.65 --> 4253.369
upload it and if you're a troll or

4249.429 --> 4255.4400000000005
whatever the hell else is out there then

4253.369 --> 4257.058999999999
you can download it or something

4255.44 --> 4260.749
it doesn't really matter vote is a vote

4257.059 --> 4263.84
and yeah don't forget to subscribe to my

4260.749 --> 4266.05
channel and yeah if you want to support

4263.84 --> 4268.849
me you can do it through the super cats

4266.05 --> 4271.579000000001
to be like yeah I've had some support

4268.849 --> 4276.71
today thank you again for that I'll get

4271.579 --> 4282.639
to the the 70 euro $70 minimum line

4276.71 --> 4282.639
pretty quickly this way I think and yeah

4284.409 --> 4297.719
yeah again I will just continue going

4288.37 --> 4301.179
and cooling down from that peak rage and

4297.719 --> 4303.4890000000005
get back to normal I guess to some

4301.179 --> 4305.56
people it'll just be back to normal

4303.489 --> 4307.78
because they don't understand the

4305.56 --> 4311.4400000000005
significance of what was really going on

4307.78 --> 4313.719
and that's yeah that that's their issue

4311.44 --> 4319.15
if you can't see it you can't see it if

4313.719 --> 4321.969
you can't see it then I hope it helped

4319.15 --> 4329.62
you get a better understanding of things

4321.969 --> 4333.67
and of me now I work anyway the Flat

4329.62 --> 4336.67
Earth debates are bound to be up and

4333.67 --> 4342.07
running so I will go there right after

4336.67 --> 4344.679
this and just cool off a moment because

4342.07 --> 4348.28
yeah it is very different okay like I

4344.679 --> 4350.17
said yesterday - I was we have

4348.28 --> 4353.11
completely out of my mind

4350.17 --> 4355.4490000000005
emotional and [ __ ] and then yeah I go to

4353.11 --> 4358.96
the debates and it's like nothing ever

4355.449 --> 4361.419999999999
happened well guess what why you think

4358.96 --> 4363.19
it's like oh the act is over I can just

4361.42 --> 4366.219
act like a normal person again and not

4363.19 --> 4369.969
have the feelings no that's not what's

4366.219 --> 4372.76
going on it's an escape Flat Earth

4369.969 --> 4376.929
debate has a focus sort of programmed

4372.76 --> 4379.6
and when I am distressed it's I can

4376.929 --> 4381.969
choose to go there and adapt to that

4379.6 --> 4385.3
format and then I can keep myself better

4381.969 --> 4388.06
under control and basically forget about

4385.3 --> 4390.46
it for a moment that's what it is it's

4388.06 --> 4393.04
not it's not dropping the act

4390.46 --> 4394.449
okay the feelings are not an act if you

4393.04 --> 4399.78
think that was an act then you're a

4394.449 --> 4403.03
sociopath a clinical sociopath alright

4399.78 --> 4407.199
just for the clarity of that so I will

4403.03 --> 4408.469999999999
after this go to the Flat Earth debate

4407.199 --> 4411.469999999999
and just do

4408.47 --> 4414.55
whatever's over there and I will be back

4411.47 --> 4416.21
tomorrow with flatters earlybird number

4414.55 --> 4423.2
83 right

4416.21 --> 4426.56
no 84 that's just it so not much talk

4423.2 --> 4429.32
about the flutter but doesn't really

4426.56 --> 4437.530000000001
matter everything has a time in a place

4429.32 --> 4437.53
so yeah until the next time keep it flat
