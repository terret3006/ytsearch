113.159 --> 120.32000000000001
somehow hanging over

115.68 --> 120.32000000000001
at low so it's like a little bit

121.979 --> 125.17999999999999
more whitish

125.34 --> 130.22
down here but up there it seems just

127.5 --> 130.22
perfectly blue

131.52 --> 135.86
and it's actually kind of nice and warm

133.62 --> 135.86
outside

Bill Nye the science denier good morning

165.42 --> 171.29999999999998
it is Saturday the 5th of March 2022.

173.16 --> 175.64

a steamy Traveler

185.819 --> 191.33999999999997
how's the microphone today sounds good

188.519 --> 195.26
well it's the same microphone

191.34 --> 195.26
didn't give any glitches at the start

196.5 --> 202.76
so that's nice

199.26 --> 202.76
hello Gadget inspector

208.56 --> 211.28
ah

214.56 --> 216.739
foreign

219.2 --> 225.92
man I slept long again although this

222.78 --> 225.92
time I did actually

225.959 --> 230.76
well did I go to bed on a good time yeah

228.72 --> 233.28
a little better I'm I'm it's really

230.76 --> 234.89999999999998
tough for some reason

233.28 --> 237.86
in the night

234.9 --> 237.86
it's a lot of energy

237.959 --> 242.04
and it's really tough basically to just

240.12 --> 244.019
say like now just wind it down and go to

242.04 --> 246.739
bed

244.019 --> 246.739
hmm

249.12 --> 253.31900000000002
because yeah I did sleep like past one

251.58 --> 255.59900000000002
even today

253.319 --> 259.62
and it was so nice it was just really

255.599 --> 261.18
relaxing and no noise anywhere and

259.62 --> 265.199
just great

261.18 --> 268.28000000000003
hey clutch borders boy

265.199 --> 268.28000000000003
Mike zidunich

268.8 --> 273.24
a shout out to all my patreon supporters

271.139 --> 275.639
just got

273.24 --> 277.44
the money in from that

275.639 --> 280.56
so that's

277.44 --> 284.9
gaining wisdom

280.56 --> 284.9
and uh brand m

285.3 --> 290.479
what else was in there

287.699 --> 290.479
at four

292.199 --> 295.1
uh

300.24 --> 304.34000000000003
I don't really go there often but

311.58 --> 316.85999999999996
right oh yeah Dusty riders in there and

314.46 --> 320.12
hey Godzilla you too you're also a

316.86 --> 320.12
patreon I didn't know that

321.6 --> 326.3
oh I've forgotten anyway thanks for that

329.22 --> 332.66
thanks for the patreon support

333.3 --> 336.139
uh

353.24 --> 359.72
skeptic 936

356.88 --> 359.71999999999997
hello hello

363.3 --> 365.78000000000003
right

368.78 --> 374.21999999999997
uh yeah yesterday's flight Earth debate

371.699 --> 376.8
was kind of short

374.22 --> 379.319
in the sense that the after show Nathan

376.8 --> 381.78000000000003
rounded out I don't know why

379.319 --> 384.86
but there weren't any Ballers getting in

381.78 --> 384.85999999999996
so it yeah

391.68 --> 397.38
it's not well it is you can still learn

395.28 --> 400.13899999999995
something from it but it is basically

397.38 --> 403.38
when there's no other Ballers coming in

400.139 --> 405.6
to challenge it's really just about like

403.38 --> 408.24
yeah looking for your through your

405.6 --> 410.46000000000004
Victory trophies and just

408.24 --> 412.259
figure out if you can find out more

410.46 --> 415.56
detail about the victory that's really

412.259 --> 418.28000000000003
the flatter debate these days

415.56 --> 418.28000000000003
uh

419.94 --> 427.58
because the discussion

423.12 --> 427.58
the debate is just very very one

437.22 --> 440.72
hello Bobby steals

441.0 --> 444.979
even Nathan needs pulse

471.96 --> 476.599
oh all right Jeff guess that thanks for

474.479 --> 476.599
that

485.16 --> 490.16
wait what

487.379 --> 490.16
from Jose

493.56 --> 496.52
what the hell

504.479 --> 507.919
this is some kind of a joke

523.2 --> 527.279
are you sure that's the right link Jeff

525.779 --> 531.26
gashead doesn't seem like it has

527.279 --> 531.26
anything to do with Ukraine

541.08 --> 547.519
this is a video from Jose you you linked

544.26 --> 547.519
up with Jeff gas head

575.88 --> 582.5
the spoof link what does that mean is it

579.3 --> 582.5
the right link or isn't it

584.04 --> 589.16
a rake back

586.5 --> 589.16
hmm

597.959 --> 602.54
hey at least g wow we got a full house

600.24 --> 602.54
here

609.24 --> 612.5
right Jeff

615.3 --> 619.579
ah look at this so

633.24 --> 635.899
all right

640.56 --> 646.8
hey Tony Whitcomb Derek 306 wow like

644.279 --> 648.779
everybody I've ever known in my chat is

646.8 --> 650.16
pretty much in here now or at least

648.779 --> 652.579
everybody that's been there in the last

650.16 --> 652.579
half year

652.86 --> 659.4590000000001
never seen Jose's videos ever but how

656.399 --> 660.959
did you link to that then Jeff how's

659.459 --> 663.68
that even possible

660.959 --> 663.68
this is

677.519 --> 683.82
yes borders boy I know I remember it

680.04 --> 687.42
even from that time 2014

683.82 --> 691.44
I remember just being really pissed off

687.42 --> 694.74
with like the numpty normies

691.44 --> 696.0600000000001
for still just going with Ukraine back

694.74 --> 698.82
then

696.06 --> 700.4399999999999
even though they were even then exposed

698.82 --> 703.6400000000001
as Nazis

700.44 --> 703.6400000000001
it's just like

711.36 --> 717.24
it's just a really bad sign that people

713.779 --> 720.38
basically will buy into whatever they

717.24 --> 720.38
are told to buy into

725.04 --> 730.279
hey can a bear

727.44 --> 730.2790000000001
psych bear

739.26 --> 741.86
hmm

760.98 --> 765.5600000000001
what what are you talking about Tony

763.019 --> 769.639
with him

765.56 --> 769.6389999999999
slap jabbed what is that

788.22 --> 792.6
I say hello to Adam Price yet man

791.22 --> 795.139
there's so many people in this chat

792.6 --> 795.139
right now

795.48 --> 798.0790000000001
hmm

824.94 --> 828.0790000000001
hello Jose

828.6 --> 834.98
I didn't know you were doing like review

831.42 --> 834.9799999999999
videos about my work

845.04 --> 849.3
I thought that was just Sean Hawkins and

847.44 --> 852.6800000000001
some of the other anti-flat earthers am

849.3 --> 852.68
I now such a study object

861.3 --> 864.5
hey Matthew Hall

911.76 --> 915.38
in a funny way

915.779 --> 919.279
how was it funny Jose

920.76 --> 924.3199999999999
how how exactly

924.54 --> 929.699
you want to go over it what you thought

926.459 --> 932.5189999999999
was so funny about it I'll talk about it

929.699 --> 934.8
because I did actually notice

932.519 --> 937.5
what the theme was and if I remember

934.8 --> 939.3
correctly what I was talking about

937.5 --> 941.66
I don't think that was really a funny

939.3 --> 941.66
thing

942.12 --> 948.72
also just for the record yeah the the

945.6 --> 951.779
breakup that I was talking about it

948.72 --> 955.259
wasn't exclusively because of Flat Earth

951.779 --> 957.18
Flat Earth is the thing that kind of

955.259 --> 959.519
made me

957.18 --> 962.88
disconnect

959.519 --> 967.16
from her because I knew that like if she

962.88 --> 967.16
has that Dynamic that means like

968.579 --> 973.1389999999999
it's not gonna be have the flexibility

971.04 --> 975.8
that I actually need to grow with her

973.139 --> 975.8
into the future

977.519 --> 982.019
all right but I think that a more

980.04 --> 984.54
primary reason is that she didn't want

982.019 --> 988.22
to have any kids

984.54 --> 988.2199999999999
like really didn't want to

993.899 --> 998.459
but maybe you still thought it was funny

995.88 --> 1001.66
because I did mention Flat Earth having

998.459 --> 1001.66
an involvement in it

1009.38 --> 1015.639
yeah the drawing yeah the drawing was

1011.66 --> 1015.639
cool steamy traveler I remember that

1021.38 --> 1026.66
I'm walking the intro

1023.959 --> 1028.9389999999999
really the intro

1026.66 --> 1032.5
with the birds why would you walk that

1028.939 --> 1032.5
there's a great intro I love it

1037.579 --> 1039.76
thank you

1045.439 --> 1048.28
whoa

1055.52 --> 1059.78
oh right yeah guns with nephron that's

1058.16 --> 1062.3600000000001
okay

1059.78 --> 1065.24
car Transmissions

1062.36 --> 1067.4799999999998
yeah car needs maintenance too that's

1065.24 --> 1067.48
fine

1075.44 --> 1079.039
don't change it it's the best yeah I

1077.419 --> 1079.94
agree kind of very I'm not gonna change

1079.039 --> 1082.7
it

1079.94 --> 1084.6200000000001
like even Adam has offered like oh maybe

1082.7 --> 1086.8400000000001
we should like update the intro and I'm

1084.62 --> 1089.2399999999998
like uh no

1086.84 --> 1094.6
I really like that intro especially

1089.24 --> 1094.6
because I basically set it up

1095.539 --> 1100.58
and I did it very intuitively it was

1097.88 --> 1101.66
something like oh like let's let's do it

1100.58 --> 1103.58
now

1101.66 --> 1106.22
and it worked out great I'm really happy

1103.58 --> 1108.82
this thing is like several years old now

1106.22 --> 1108.82
and it's great

1111.43 --> 1114.519
[Music]

1116.78 --> 1122.08
it seems like Jose doesn't really want

1119.179 --> 1122.0800000000002
to discuss this

1138.02 --> 1141.8799999999999
right kind of beer yeah exactly

1159.08 --> 1164.8999999999999
my modern is acting up what using date I

1163.4 --> 1167.799
don't know what that means Guns of

1164.9 --> 1167.799
Navarone but okay

1175.58 --> 1179.12
oh there

1177.2 --> 1183.02
clutch

1179.12 --> 1185.62
could you discuss gravity works

1183.02 --> 1185.62
link

1188.059 --> 1195.94
well sure I could discuss it clutch yeah

1192.38 --> 1195.94
what do you want to know about it

1198.919 --> 1201.5200000000002
I mean

1201.919 --> 1206.8400000000001
about how it's supposed to be working

1204.159 --> 1208.2990000000002
where they basically pull things out of

1206.84 --> 1210.799
wax still use

1208.299 --> 1214.1
Newtonian gravity

1210.799 --> 1217.1
modeling to suggest that all Air has

1214.1 --> 1218.6589999999999
weight and then it just sits on top of

1217.1 --> 1221.48
the ball

1218.659 --> 1225.0200000000002
because it goes down in that model that

1221.48 --> 1227.059
that is kind of like the the base

1225.02 --> 1230.12
belief structure

1227.059 --> 1232.1589999999999
that guides most people's ideas about

1230.12 --> 1234.4399999999998
how that's supposed to work

1232.159 --> 1236.48
if yeah and it's it's broken it's not

1234.44 --> 1238.46
it's incomplete

1236.48 --> 1240.26
right it ignores that gas actually

1238.46 --> 1242.78
expands in all directions

1240.26 --> 1244.94
which is typically Newtonian Newton

1242.78 --> 1247.3999999999999
ignored a lot of things concerning gas

1244.94 --> 1250.059
except for a basic friction of objects

1247.4 --> 1250.0590000000002
going through it

1251.72 --> 1257.179
but in Newton's entire model is based on

1255.14 --> 1259.3400000000001
everything is basically in a container

1257.179 --> 1263.5590000000002
with the stable pressure

1259.34 --> 1263.559
that's why it's soft fit to ignore it

1269.659 --> 1274.72
is that what you wanted to hear clutch

1272.299 --> 1274.72
or

1277.22 --> 1282.4
or you want to know the issues with

1279.5 --> 1282.4
Einstein gravity

1291.44 --> 1296.919
what Jose is s-u-s what is that

1313.46 --> 1317.2
back in 60s what

1322.4 --> 1327.02
oh

1324.02 --> 1329.5
God yeah don't do that don't round out

1327.02 --> 1329.5
words

1329.659 --> 1332.8600000000001
don't do that

1334.34 --> 1339.32
such a terrible habit don't round out

1337.039 --> 1343.12
every freaking word to like three

1339.32 --> 1343.12
letters that's like the worst

1343.28 --> 1346.8999999999999
it's the worst habit ever

1347.36 --> 1350.74
like I'm not adapting

1351.74 --> 1353.919
foreign

1363.4 --> 1368.8400000000001
chasing the magpies yeah yeah that it

1367.1 --> 1371.6
happens here all the time

1368.84 --> 1372.799
like when I put some bread on the on the

1371.6 --> 1376.4599999999998
roof

1372.799 --> 1378.62
then like magpies and jackdaws

1376.46 --> 1379.76
for usually deject us first they're like

1378.62 --> 1381.9799999999998
the most

1379.76 --> 1383.78
integrated into this specific location

1381.98 --> 1386.059
they're always the first

1383.78 --> 1389.559
then usually the crows and the magpies

1386.059 --> 1389.559
catch on somewhere

1389.78 --> 1393.98
and then yeah the Jack does kind of stay

1392.419 --> 1396.3200000000002
a little bit to the side because they

1393.98 --> 1397.76
don't want to get too close

1396.32 --> 1399.799
although they're not really afraid of

1397.76 --> 1402.34
the mag flies but magpies can be very

1399.799 --> 1402.34
aggressive

1402.98 --> 1408.74
but yeah the crows they don't take [ __ ]

1405.26 --> 1411.2
like they're at War basically so they

1408.74 --> 1413.9
are like usually there's like two crows

1411.2 --> 1416.3600000000001
and then one literally watches over the

1413.9 --> 1419.44
rest of the birds while one is just like

1416.36 --> 1419.4399999999998
digging in

1422.84 --> 1427.22
but yeah if the magpies get too cheeky

1425.36 --> 1429.52
then they start like chasing them and

1427.22 --> 1429.52
all that

1452.48 --> 1458.5
why is abbreviation such a long word

1454.94 --> 1458.5
yeah it's just AB man

1461.0 --> 1463.84
yeah no

1491.12 --> 1496.6399999999999
you're described it one time and it made

1493.94 --> 1498.6200000000001
sense but in the middle to do it justice

1496.64 --> 1500.539
red will clutch yeah it all depends

1498.62 --> 1503.6589999999999
right there's several about the gravity

1500.539 --> 1506.419
thing there's so many different branches

1503.659 --> 1507.919
and the structural approach of them are

1506.419 --> 1510.5590000000002
different right

1507.919 --> 1513.679
so if you wanted to explain like what

1510.559 --> 1515.84
actual what we think of as gravity is

1513.679 --> 1517.64
the relative density

1515.84 --> 1520.299
right that's a whole different way of

1517.64 --> 1520.2990000000002
explaining it

1520.88 --> 1528.46
actually backed by empirical

1524.02 --> 1528.46
let's say scientific data

1529.84 --> 1534.3799999999999
right the relation between the density

1532.4 --> 1535.64
of the object and the density of the

1534.38 --> 1538.46
medium

1535.64 --> 1541.7
and then the differential

1538.46 --> 1544.1000000000001
will determine in which direction it

1541.7 --> 1547.46
will move up or down

1544.1 --> 1549.799
and with how much force the greater the

1547.46 --> 1552.559
differential the greater the relative

1549.799 --> 1554.6589999999999
density this equilibrium Force

1552.559 --> 1556.96
with which it will move in either

1554.659 --> 1556.96
direction

1563.9 --> 1568.24
in the dictionary what are you talking

1566.0 --> 1568.24
about

1568.279 --> 1571.0
really

1576.98 --> 1582.039
in addiction but

1578.96 --> 1582.039
what does that mean

1588.919 --> 1594.14
I mean when I Google it there is

1591.86 --> 1597.5
definitely immediate like the meaning of

1594.14 --> 1600.74
it the translation so to say it's not in

1597.5 --> 1603.1
the dictionary is seems technically kind

1600.74 --> 1603.1
of weird

1603.44 --> 1608.24
stimulator that's incorrect unless

1605.84 --> 1610.52
you're making a joke suggesting that

1608.24 --> 1612.38
they would take it out because there are

1610.52 --> 1614.2
so many people so incredibly gullible

1612.38 --> 1616.64
now that they thought it would be better

1614.2 --> 1618.679
less triggering if they take out the

1616.64 --> 1621.1000000000001
word or something because I don't get it

1618.679 --> 1621.1000000000001
otherwise

1626.539 --> 1630.94
gullible people to look it up oh okay

1633.559 --> 1639.08
oh boy you made me look yeah well dude

1636.62 --> 1642.08
this is the freaking age of censorship I

1639.08 --> 1646.24
just I just roll out like

1642.08 --> 1646.24
why they could potentially do it

1646.34 --> 1649.0
so

1659.0 --> 1661.779
okay

1662.36 --> 1666.76
didn't have to retract that message what

1664.34 --> 1666.76
is boy

1674.36 --> 1679.1589999999999
right

1676.22 --> 1681.919
I don't really appreciate being played

1679.159 --> 1683.779
on like this by the way yeah I'm very

1681.919 --> 1686.3600000000001
honest and direct

1683.779 --> 1688.039
I don't like to be manipulated by people

1686.36 --> 1691.779
that I actually

1688.039 --> 1691.779
Trust on I can respect

1693.86 --> 1698.9599999999998
so if you guys could please stop doing

1695.6 --> 1700.8799999999999
that that would be great

1698.96 --> 1703.1000000000001
I mean the trolls already try to

1700.88 --> 1705.2600000000002
manipulate me as much as they can I

1703.1 --> 1708.279
don't need you guys to start [ __ ]

1705.26 --> 1708.279
around with it as well

1710.0 --> 1715.0
it's the weekend yeah I know it is

1726.08 --> 1728.86
oh okay

1736.34 --> 1741.5
ah yes psych bear of course yeah I've

1739.22 --> 1743.24
seen that video

1741.5 --> 1746.48
20 years ago

1743.24 --> 1749.559
more saw that before the 20th century

1746.48 --> 1749.559
for 21st century

1755.36 --> 1761.36
but yeah it's dubious it's not really

1758.36 --> 1764.36
the firmament it's a suggestion of that

1761.36 --> 1767.299
or what it actually is is more likely to

1764.36 --> 1770.84
be is hitting a layer of super saline

1767.299 --> 1773.24
water like really super Saline

1770.84 --> 1776.12
which is so thick that

1773.24 --> 1779.6
it Refuge it's like custard almost like

1776.12 --> 1782.779
you can't really push it aside

1779.6 --> 1785.299
right so when they try to get in it they

1782.779 --> 1787.399
bounced off like they would bounce off

1785.299 --> 1791.74
custard doesn't mean that they can't get

1787.399 --> 1791.7399999999998
through it just not like that

1792.2 --> 1796.039
you understand

1793.7 --> 1800.72
so it's not actually the firmament that

1796.039 --> 1803.299
was like a sep Oceanic layer of super

1800.72 --> 1806.059
saline water there's multiple

1803.299 --> 1809.059
places where there's that there's been

1806.059 --> 1811.399
entire Nature Documentaries about that

1809.059 --> 1813.98
phenomena well not entire but where it

1811.399 --> 1819.1399999999999
is addressed it's like super

1813.98 --> 1819.14
oh [ __ ] super deep Oceanic documentaries

1827.299 --> 1830.84
like even that documentaries they even

1829.76 --> 1834.46
show

1830.84 --> 1836.72
there's this weird super deep Oceanic

1834.46 --> 1839.24
worm-like creatures that kind of [ __ ]

1836.72 --> 1842.24
around and swim around

1839.24 --> 1845.1200000000001
and then if they get caught in the super

1842.24 --> 1846.86
Sai line they're like ah panic panic and

1845.12 --> 1849.02
they try to struggle out and if they

1846.86 --> 1851.74
don't then they basically sink into it

1849.02 --> 1851.74
and they just

1852.44 --> 1857.0800000000002
yeah

1854.179 --> 1861.5800000000002
become or pickled

1857.08 --> 1861.58
it becomes super salty and die

1862.64 --> 1867.5590000000002
right but you can't get through it you

1865.1 --> 1869.84
could technically

1867.559 --> 1871.76
Take a Little Rock

1869.84 --> 1874.76
throw it on there it would probably

1871.76 --> 1877.82
first rest and then just eventually kind

1874.76 --> 1881.059
of slowly sink through so it's not

1877.82 --> 1886.24
literally a a physical hard barrier of

1881.059 --> 1886.24
any kind or even flexible heart barrier

1897.679 --> 1903.159
but yeah it's definitely a very

1899.779 --> 1903.159
interesting phenomenon

1909.799 --> 1915.86
right but yeah the best in my opinion

1913.22 --> 1918.08
the best way to think about it that

1915.86 --> 1920.4799999999998
super saline water and how it works how

1918.08 --> 1922.1589999999999
it would work is by comparing it to

1920.48 --> 1923.539
custard

1922.159 --> 1925.94
right

1923.539 --> 1930.3799999999999
you all know how silly that stuff is

1925.94 --> 1933.0800000000002
it's been like endless science shows

1930.38 --> 1935.24
about it oh it's so special

1933.08 --> 1936.74
but it is but the substance is kind of

1935.24 --> 1939.26
special because you can literally like

1936.74 --> 1941.299
fill a swimming pool with it and just

1939.26 --> 1942.32
run across it but if you then stand

1941.299 --> 1944.6
still

1942.32 --> 1947.6
you absolutely sink into it you're gonna

1944.6 --> 1949.399
have a heart a hard time like pulling

1947.6 --> 1951.6789999999999
yourself out again

1949.399 --> 1956.0
oh that's kind of what

1951.679 --> 1959.0
what that Super Saiyan water is like

1956.0 --> 1961.94
if you have a broad thing trying to push

1959.0 --> 1964.22
through it'll just bounce off but if you

1961.94 --> 1966.3200000000002
have like a little if you like stab it

1964.22 --> 1969.08
with a knife I bet that will go through

1966.32 --> 1973.0
not without any trouble just like it

1969.08 --> 1973.0
would with custard see

1982.039 --> 1987.26
yeah Matthew it does look cool

1984.74 --> 1989.0
surface tension yeah but not just

1987.26 --> 1991.419
surface tension it's not just the

1989.0 --> 1991.419
surface

1992.179 --> 1997.48
the whole thing is pretty thick like

1994.94 --> 1997.48
custard

1998.96 --> 2005.2
it's like pressurized highly saturated

2002.399 --> 2007.539
salt water and it almost becomes like

2005.2 --> 2008.8600000000001
another substance than water because of

2007.539 --> 2012.299
it

2008.86 --> 2012.299
it is really unique

2014.74 --> 2018.46
maybe that's where eels come from I

2016.84 --> 2019.9599999999998
don't think that's possible

2018.46 --> 2022.72
it's like but that's a really

2019.96 --> 2027.279
fascinating sci-fi-ish idea by the way

2022.72 --> 2028.8600000000001
but no definitely not because eels are

2027.279 --> 2031.419
still

2028.86 --> 2034.4189999999999
flesh-based creatures

2031.419 --> 2037.2990000000002
there's no animal

2034.419 --> 2040.72
or plant that could survive in super

2037.299 --> 2043.6
saline water because it like salt like

2040.72 --> 2046.98
pure salt literally it just destroys

2043.6 --> 2046.98
everything cellular

2048.099 --> 2053.099
so there's no creatures that's coming

2050.32 --> 2053.099
out of that

2054.399 --> 2060.94
like not not any flesh creatures anyway

2058.119 --> 2063.94
I mean maybe something silicon or

2060.94 --> 2066.659
something but yeah that doesn't exist as

2063.94 --> 2066.659
far as We Know

2073.119 --> 2079.56
is dying saline just like electrical

2075.82 --> 2079.56
Electric electrical yeah

2079.659 --> 2082.26
right

2083.32 --> 2087.3
heels live in rivers do they

2089.74 --> 2096.0
are you sure that's eels

2091.899 --> 2096.0
Sweetwater eels could be

2098.079 --> 2102.04
but eels are very weird creatures they

2100.599 --> 2106.119
have like different

2102.04 --> 2108.04
stages like butterfly cocoons

2106.119 --> 2110.5
they have like different forms of eels

2108.04 --> 2113.92
but they're all the same eel

2110.5 --> 2115.9
so there might be like a stage in which

2113.92 --> 2118.0
it is fresh water and it will seek that

2115.9 --> 2119.98
out

2118.0 --> 2123.0
but there's Deb most of them are are

2119.98 --> 2123.0
just sea eels

2133.3 --> 2137.099
yeah eels are weird creatures

2152.56 --> 2156.0
hello Jerry Ellison

2159.579 --> 2161.76
foreign

2174.9 --> 2178.8
determining what you're talking about

2190.839 --> 2195.04
onto the Riverside catching spiders

2193.78 --> 2199.48
really

2195.04 --> 2202.839
they snatch like insects from land that

2199.48 --> 2206.04
is very weird Matthew oh

2202.839 --> 2206.04
that is very weird

2220.66 --> 2224.04
that makes no sense Jose

2294.64 --> 2297.64
anatomas

2298.359 --> 2300.96
what

2301.66 --> 2305.339
I don't recognize that word

2315.7 --> 2320.8799999999997
oh

2317.26 --> 2320.88
what okay

2321.4 --> 2325.48
that's so odd I've never heard of that

2323.56 --> 2327.5789999999997
word it's the same in Dutch I've never

2325.48 --> 2331.44
heard of that

2327.579 --> 2331.44
maybe just completely forgotten

2335.099 --> 2339.1800000000003
anatomous hmm

2387.099 --> 2391.3
you have to

2389.02 --> 2394.78
yeah but George Sanford

2391.3 --> 2398.8
they go to see to mate they go up a

2394.78 --> 2401.0400000000004
river just to lay eggs that's how they

2398.8 --> 2401.04
work

2404.26 --> 2408.94
the right to mate and lay eggs right so

2407.14 --> 2411.22
the males like

2408.94 --> 2413.38
I don't know they have to first struggle

2411.22 --> 2417.839
to get up there and then those that

2413.38 --> 2417.839
actually make it they get to breed

2419.02 --> 2423.18
and so do the Ladies by the way

2424.24 --> 2429.4599999999996
must be pretty tough to basically be all

2426.76 --> 2431.26
full with eggs and then try to jump up a

2429.46 --> 2433.92
river and all that but apparently it

2431.26 --> 2433.92
works out

2474.819 --> 2480.16
all right yeah but I think that electric

2478.72 --> 2483.5789999999997
eels

2480.16 --> 2485.92
Matthew Hall aren't actually eels

2483.579 --> 2487.119
I think I remember that from a nature

2485.92 --> 2489.04
documentary

2487.119 --> 2492.339
that they're not actually the same

2489.04 --> 2493.9
family they've just been called eels but

2492.339 --> 2496.66
they're like very different like

2493.9 --> 2497.98
electric eels don't actually jump up a

2496.66 --> 2500.2
river and all that

2497.98 --> 2503.04
Wait no that's salmon what the hell am I

2500.2 --> 2503.04
talking about uh

2503.26 --> 2509.4
I've heard they're a different type of

2505.06 --> 2509.4
creature they're not actually an eel

2509.74 --> 2516.24
but maybe I'm wrong

2512.98 --> 2516.2400000000002
and I'm confused

2522.98 --> 2527.53
[Applause]

2529.54 --> 2535.4
[Applause]

2569.619 --> 2571.8
foreign

2587.94 --> 2593.76
ERS what

2590.92 --> 2593.76
okay

2595.06 --> 2599.619
that definitely does not sound like a

2597.579 --> 2602.02
regular eel it but

2599.619 --> 2604.359
looking through the wiki I'm not exactly

2602.02 --> 2606.839
getting the answer to the question I

2604.359 --> 2606.839
wanted to

2614.859 --> 2621.4
right so I was right about that I knew I

2618.64 --> 2624.52
knew I was right about that

2621.4 --> 2627.46
I couldn't find it when looking for it

2624.52 --> 2629.619
but yeah regular eels are different from

2627.46 --> 2632.02
electric eels electric eels are just

2629.619 --> 2634.319
cold eels they're not actually an eel

2632.02 --> 2634.319
type

2649.359 --> 2654.0989999999997
but it's so weird that they are actually

2652.0 --> 2656.619
air bravers so

2654.099 --> 2659.28
it's like

2656.619 --> 2659.28
yeah

2668.56 --> 2674.14
so yeah electric eels are never then

2671.02 --> 2675.52
gonna be super deep water fish right

2674.14 --> 2677.74
they're gonna stay to the surface

2675.52 --> 2678.94
because they're air breathers

2677.74 --> 2681.54
that's

2678.94 --> 2681.54
odd

2698.26 --> 2701.26
foreign

2705.16 --> 2710.2
dolphins breathe air and live in water

2707.74 --> 2713.2799999999997
yeah but they're really big fish or not

2710.2 --> 2713.2799999999997
fish mammals

2719.98 --> 2724.48
all right and

2721.66 --> 2727.319
like that sort of creature just like

2724.48 --> 2727.319
whales they don't

2727.48 --> 2732.88
when they don't go like to the deepest

2729.7 --> 2735.0989999999997
regions of the ocean right they they

2732.88 --> 2739.42
stay to the surface because they gotta

2735.099 --> 2739.42
get up and breathe periodically

2739.839 --> 2747.16
while regular eels are known to be like

2743.5 --> 2750.04
ocean bottom creatures they

2747.16 --> 2753.0989999999997
yeah they go for like giant whale

2750.04 --> 2756.579
carcasses that literally

2753.099 --> 2759.04
fall down to the bottom of the ocean

2756.579 --> 2762.8390000000004
because they don't need to go up to

2759.04 --> 2762.839
breathe they get it out of the water

2779.26 --> 2782.6400000000003
so yeah

2782.8 --> 2786.2400000000002
it's all taxonomical

2821.92 --> 2828.78
hey Adam making

2824.02 --> 2828.78
my take on pandas I don't know

2831.76 --> 2838.0
either they're [ __ ] in costumes

2834.76 --> 2840.4
probably not or they might be in some

2838.0 --> 2842.74
occasions it might be a little Grappler

2840.4 --> 2845.079
trick or they dress up people like that

2842.74 --> 2849.5789999999997
as that might exist but if there are

2845.079 --> 2853.3
species they're very likely an early

2849.579 --> 2856.78
genetic modification project like a very

2853.3 --> 2859.119
early one where they cross bread

2856.78 --> 2861.4
certain type of bears or something and

2859.119 --> 2865.54
then it came out so I think that the

2861.4 --> 2868.5
panda is originally a genetic experiment

2865.54 --> 2870.94
like probably one of the first

2868.5 --> 2874.119
experiments where they actually managed

2870.94 --> 2875.92
to just get a like halfway surviving

2874.119 --> 2878.7400000000002
replicating

2875.92 --> 2882.839
species out of it that didn't just let

2878.74 --> 2882.839
go die immediately

2884.559 --> 2887.8190000000004
right mutations

2889.3 --> 2894.5
gem pandas are mutations

2892.54 --> 2897.61
foreign

2894.5 --> 2897.61
[Music]

2903.579 --> 2909.52
take on a panda they look soft the [ __ ]

2906.88 --> 2913.54
yeah but it's it gets really hot though

2909.52 --> 2915.52
Adam again you don't like get

2913.54 --> 2918.16
well maybe they do it that would be

2915.52 --> 2920.099
weird that you get like internal cooling

2918.16 --> 2923.74
system like with

2920.099 --> 2925.48
with space suits astronaut suits you

2923.74 --> 2927.64
have to like inner cooling you'd need

2925.48 --> 2930.339
that in a freaking panda suit it's

2927.64 --> 2933.54
really freaking hot having all that fur

2930.339 --> 2933.54
on top of everything else

2957.099 --> 2962.099
hey

2958.599 --> 2962.099
okay Matthew Hall

2964.0 --> 2967.74
that's kind of ridiculous

2996.599 --> 3000.8590000000004
what what's that at least G

3002.04 --> 3005.04
foreign

3043.859 --> 3048.74
what what are you talking about George

3046.68 --> 3052.0789999999997
Sanford

3048.74 --> 3054.54
orangutans and pandas are the same what

3052.079 --> 3057.619
are you no

3054.54 --> 3062.64
where the hell did you get that from

3057.619 --> 3064.5
orangutan is an ape a panda is a bear

3062.64 --> 3067.22
they're not the same group that's

3064.5 --> 3067.22
ridiculous

3069.78 --> 3073.46
don't know about toucans but

3075.0 --> 3081.26
you seem to be very off there I I don't

3078.78 --> 3081.26
like that

3082.92 --> 3085.88
don't do that

3101.46 --> 3106.5
lab pandas

3104.52 --> 3109.64
yeah laugh it up

3106.5 --> 3113.3
Jerry Ellison pandas were probably

3109.64 --> 3113.2999999999997
created in the lab

3114.72 --> 3120.2999999999997
maybe even in a very very early Wuhan

3118.26 --> 3123.6600000000003
lab

3120.3 --> 3126.48
in like the 19th century Wuhan probably

3123.66 --> 3130.14
already was there now just

3126.48 --> 3132.559
probably not but who knows maybe it's a

3130.14 --> 3132.5589999999997
big city

3134.28 --> 3137.46
I don't know where they're supposedly

3135.9 --> 3140.64
from

3137.46 --> 3143.94
as far as I've learned they only exist

3140.64 --> 3147.44
in a very specific region in China it

3143.94 --> 3150.7200000000003
might just be the Wuhan region who knows

3147.44 --> 3152.52
that would be kind of funny if that

3150.72 --> 3154.6189999999997
turned out to be the case but it's

3152.52 --> 3157.14
probably not

3154.619 --> 3159.54
but they were very much created in the

3157.14 --> 3161.7599999999998
lab very likely and then set out in the

3159.54 --> 3164.46
wild there were never any recordings and

3161.76 --> 3166.8190000000004
you have to remember China is literally

3164.46 --> 3170.4
the oldest

3166.819 --> 3174.7799999999997
civilization with writing and recordings

3170.4 --> 3177.42
and everything on Earth and there's no

3174.78 --> 3179.94
historical record of pandas whatsoever

3177.42 --> 3183.48
in the slightest and there's a lot of

3179.94 --> 3186.42
attention to animals yeah so it is an

3183.48 --> 3188.88
artificially created species

3186.42 --> 3191.04
very early attempt

3188.88 --> 3193.26
to try something like that

3191.04 --> 3195.66
in the same time that Evolution was

3193.26 --> 3198.8390000000004
getting all praised and all that

3195.66 --> 3200.0989999999997
19th century and it was probably the

3198.839 --> 3202.7999999999997
first

3200.099 --> 3205.559
modern in the yeah in the U this human

3202.8 --> 3208.7000000000003
age the first attempt at a genetically

3205.559 --> 3208.7000000000003
modified species

3208.98 --> 3213.9
are you serious yeah I am serious I'm

3212.28 --> 3216.96
very serious yeah

3213.9 --> 3220.26
yeah pandas are genetically modified

3216.96 --> 3223.859
bears from the 19th century probably the

3220.26 --> 3226.98
first genetically modified species

3223.859 --> 3228.9
in modern human history yeah that's what

3226.98 --> 3231.559
I'm saying that's exactly what I'm

3228.9 --> 3231.559
saying yes

3233.16 --> 3238.2599999999998
that's hilarious oh glad you think it's

3236.339 --> 3241.52
funny

3238.26 --> 3241.5200000000004
I don't think it's funny

3241.68 --> 3246.839
it's creepy

3244.2 --> 3250.68
I mean that species the panda can barely

3246.839 --> 3254.2999999999997
procreate which is already a direct sign

3250.68 --> 3254.2999999999997
of genetic modification

3254.4 --> 3258.6600000000003
right when you start to genetically

3256.14 --> 3259.68
modify dramatically the first thing that

3258.66 --> 3263.5789999999997
goes

3259.68 --> 3268.94
is reproductive abilities and mental

3263.579 --> 3268.94
faculties always always happens

3278.04 --> 3283.74
you can yeah I am serious I am serious

3281.64 --> 3285.48
Jerry Ellison

3283.74 --> 3288.7799999999997
what do you think I literally made that

3285.48 --> 3290.94
up no I didn't that's actually real very

3288.78 --> 3292.619
certain about it

3290.94 --> 3294.96
yeah

3292.619 --> 3297.54
like even in the past I've been shoved

3294.96 --> 3300.299
in it with my face by certain

3297.54 --> 3302.64
individuals yeah I am I am serious you

3300.299 --> 3305.579
want to get banned

3302.64 --> 3309.9
you want to get ban Jerry I'll ban you

3305.579 --> 3313.28
you were just oh you are an idiot bye

3309.9 --> 3313.28
yeah I'm not kidding

3320.339 --> 3326.0
I mean outrageous who could have ever

3323.7 --> 3328.14
thought that

3326.0 --> 3331.44
Humanity could make a genetically

3328.14 --> 3334.6189999999997
modified species and keep it a secret

3331.44 --> 3336.54
in a time where entire history and our

3334.619 --> 3339.359
view of it was being Rewritten

3336.54 --> 3342.42
constantly I mean why would they do that

3339.359 --> 3343.5
they only introduced dinosaurs

3342.42 --> 3345.66
yeah

3343.5 --> 3348.119
completely made up

3345.66 --> 3350.22
I mean what's so weird about then making

3348.119 --> 3351.9
a genetically modified Panda and

3350.22 --> 3355.4599999999996
claiming

3351.9 --> 3355.46
that it was always there

3389.099 --> 3394.52
right Jerry must have been a newcomer

3395.819 --> 3402.0589999999997
just pop by doesn't understand how this

3399.24 --> 3404.22
works never probably never seen a single

3402.059 --> 3406.079
show of the early bird show before even

3404.22 --> 3409.5
though it's looking like hey yeah this

3406.079 --> 3409.5
is episode 1175.

3409.619 --> 3415.4
that means

3411.799 --> 3419.4
thousand a hundred and seventy episodes

3415.4 --> 3423.6600000000003
yeah there's a certain code of conduct

3419.4 --> 3426.96
also I literally don't make [ __ ] up I

3423.66 --> 3430.5589999999997
make a great effort to not make [ __ ] up

3426.96 --> 3431.64
and if I do then I will literally say

3430.559 --> 3436.02
that

3431.64 --> 3439.44
very emphasized as to not mistake it

3436.02 --> 3441.359
do not do not have the viewers have a

3439.44 --> 3443.339
mistake about what I'm talking about

3441.359 --> 3447.0589999999997
about something made up

3443.339 --> 3450.0589999999997
conceptual or something that's real

3447.059 --> 3455.42
and yeah genetically modified

3450.059 --> 3455.42
pandas I think that's very very real

3459.119 --> 3462.079
foreign

3463.38 --> 3468.6600000000003
oh really

3465.119 --> 3471.359
cave drawings with Dinosaurs

3468.66 --> 3473.04
I really did was there a Tyrannosaurus

3471.359 --> 3476.0989999999997
Rex there

3473.04 --> 3477.839
was actually dated

3476.099 --> 3479.88
did any carbon dating

3477.839 --> 3482.46
only on the cave drawings right because

3479.88 --> 3484.44
yeah

3482.46 --> 3486.9
it's the thing about it

3484.44 --> 3492.44
people can make that

3486.9 --> 3492.44
a lot later as in the 19th century

3492.839 --> 3497.4
it's a lot of unexpected caves that are

3495.96 --> 3499.98
found

3497.4 --> 3503.2200000000003
all these magnificent little drawings

3499.98 --> 3505.76
and even like a corpse here and there

3503.22 --> 3505.7599999999998
yeah

3506.099 --> 3512.099
so I have never seen a cave drawing of a

3509.88 --> 3514.579
Tyrannosaurus Rex

3512.099 --> 3514.579
right

3514.859 --> 3519.48
or Pteranodon

3517.38 --> 3522.599
have you ever seen anything that

3519.48 --> 3525.119
resembles anything like that except in

3522.599 --> 3529.2000000000003
freaking cartoons and movies

3525.119 --> 3532.98
no big lizard sure hey I believe that

3529.2 --> 3536.0589999999997
there were probably really big reptiles

3532.98 --> 3536.059
in the far past

3536.64 --> 3542.339
yeah so I would not be surprised to find

3539.76 --> 3544.26
like a drawing of a really big lizard

3542.339 --> 3548.22
somewhere they might have been called

3544.26 --> 3550.92
dragons back then right but that's not a

3548.22 --> 3552.2599999999998
dinosaur because dinosaurs are an

3550.92 --> 3556.339
artificially

3552.26 --> 3560.9
assembled creation to support

3556.339 --> 3560.9
the ideology of evolution

3561.78 --> 3567.119
they're literally made up creatures

3565.339 --> 3569.88
assembled

3567.119 --> 3572.099
assembled from other stuff

3569.88 --> 3574.559
from chicken bones and and whale

3572.099 --> 3577.26
skeletons and all that

3574.559 --> 3580.3190000000004
it's assembled right doesn't mean that

3577.26 --> 3582.0
there weren't any really big lizards in

3580.319 --> 3584.579
the past right there's even pretty big

3582.0 --> 3587.46
lizards right now

3584.579 --> 3591.42
and they called again uh

3587.46 --> 3594.599
those poisonous really big ones they can

3591.42 --> 3597.119
be like two meters tall

3594.599 --> 3599.6400000000003
right and there were probably a lot

3597.119 --> 3603.0
bigger other type of reptiles in the

3599.64 --> 3606.0589999999997
past but that's not dinosaurs yeah

3603.0 --> 3608.04
that's not millions and millions of

3606.059 --> 3610.38
years ago now that's just with humans

3608.04 --> 3612.24
yeah if they're with humans it's not

3610.38 --> 3614.04
millions and millions of years ago and

3612.24 --> 3617.8799999999997
they didn't go extinct millions and

3614.04 --> 3621.119
millions of years ago to make rise for

3617.88 --> 3624.839
the humans to evolve from the monkey or

3621.119 --> 3627.119
whatever yeah that's nonsense

3624.839 --> 3631.94
where they're pretty big lizards in the

3627.119 --> 3631.94
past yeah I'll bet I'll bet there were

3632.819 --> 3635.22
the Komodo dragons that's the one yeah

3634.559 --> 3637.7400000000002
yeah

3635.22 --> 3641.22
monitor lizards

3637.74 --> 3644.16
big freaking reptiles and they have like

3641.22 --> 3646.52
a poisonous bite very poisonous very

3644.16 --> 3646.52
deadly

3667.02 --> 3671.4
foreign

3669.0 --> 3674.46
you don't believe none of that millions

3671.4 --> 3676.38
of years really you don't believe that

3674.46 --> 3679.079
what do you believe in then

3676.38 --> 3681.48
how else could it have worked out

3679.079 --> 3684.78
so

3681.48 --> 3687.839
you do realize like the the concept of

3684.78 --> 3690.48
evolution right Jose you understand that

3687.839 --> 3693.44
it requires a lot of time right a lot of

3690.48 --> 3696.599
mistakes and then and then the one that

3693.44 --> 3698.579
overcomes the mistake is the Victor and

3696.599 --> 3699.96
procreates blah blah blah blah natural

3698.579 --> 3702.6600000000003
selection

3699.96 --> 3704.78
yeah that that would take millions of

3702.66 --> 3707.2799999999997
years if any of it made any damn sense

3704.78 --> 3709.4
it doesn't that's not how it works at

3707.28 --> 3709.4
all

3710.819 --> 3717.359
mutation never leads to Improvement of a

3714.299 --> 3720.78
species always is a degeneration always

3717.359 --> 3725.0589999999997
always leads to the same end result

3720.78 --> 3725.059
sterilization and insanity

3746.16 --> 3752.5789999999997
yeah borders boy yeah komodos are like

3749.64 --> 3754.859
the spiders of the reptiles

3752.579 --> 3758.76
they basically just inject the poison

3754.859 --> 3761.48
and then wait for it to start stop

3758.76 --> 3761.48
fleeing

3787.859 --> 3792.0589999999997
yeah Matthew Hall yeah it's pretty

3790.319 --> 3795.0
amazing idea

3792.059 --> 3797.039
I mean it's a pretty cool idea actually

3795.0 --> 3799.859
if you could

3797.039 --> 3801.599
it's like Jurassic Park except not

3799.859 --> 3804.48
really

3801.599 --> 3807.299
but you could have like a

3804.48 --> 3810.539
a special designated area where there's

3807.299 --> 3812.7
like a huge pressurized Dome where just

3810.539 --> 3816.2990000000004
more oxygen is inserted and then you

3812.7 --> 3819.5389999999998
could have like reptiles in there

3816.299 --> 3822.5389999999998
that are born and and live in there and

3819.539 --> 3824.94
they would grow like to like insane

3822.539 --> 3828.059
sizes

3824.94 --> 3830.52
like almost like dinosaurs like you

3828.059 --> 3833.4
would have like

3830.52 --> 3835.5
Komodo dragons that would be maybe like

3833.4 --> 3839.0
six meters long

3835.5 --> 3841.5
really freaking or even bigger who knows

3839.0 --> 3843.839
that that would be possible it would be

3841.5 --> 3847.02
like a Jurassic Park except not really

3843.839 --> 3849.5589999999997
it's just a really big lizard Park you

3847.02 --> 3849.559
could have that

3854.52 --> 3858.799
yeah rotting bacteria soup

3863.359 --> 3869.0389999999998
but it is also poison it's the

3866.16 --> 3871.44
combination it's it's not not it's

3869.039 --> 3874.7990000000004
digestion fluid it's which is

3871.44 --> 3876.66
effectively not good right it's a

3874.799 --> 3878.46
dissolvent

3876.66 --> 3881.42
so yeah there's it's a conjunction

3878.46 --> 3881.42
bacteria

3882.299 --> 3888.42
but just the extracted bacteria I bet

3885.72 --> 3891.1189999999997
are not gonna do anything it's the the

3888.42 --> 3892.859
whole package it's the fluid that come

3891.119 --> 3896.119
with it right

3892.859 --> 3896.119
it dissolves

3909.72 --> 3914.64
right really big lizard Park yeah that

3912.72 --> 3916.68
could be possible

3914.64 --> 3918.299
if anybody was ever crazy enough to

3916.68 --> 3920.2799999999997
attempt that

3918.299 --> 3922.799
but I bet there are some real fans of

3920.28 --> 3925.1400000000003
really big lizards right

3922.799 --> 3929.359
I mean it is like the best next best

3925.14 --> 3929.359
thing to a Jurassic Park

3938.579 --> 3940.76
foreign

3964.74 --> 3969.8999999999996
did giant humans live with normal sized

3967.38 --> 3972.0
humans I don't think they really live

3969.9 --> 3973.7400000000002
together

3972.0 --> 3976.559
but

3973.74 --> 3980.7799999999997
they probably had just like separate

3976.559 --> 3980.78
societies and they could be peaceful

3981.78 --> 3987.1800000000003
right they I mean

3985.079 --> 3989.88
it would have always be kind of an

3987.18 --> 3991.5
uneasy relationship in my opinion I I

3989.88 --> 3993.299
don't have evidence for this by the way

3991.5 --> 3995.16
I'm I'm literally just trying to

3993.299 --> 3997.2599999999998
simulate it

3995.16 --> 4000.68
it would always be kind of uneasy to

3997.26 --> 4003.92
have like really large humans

4000.68 --> 4006.319
like the the red-headed Giants in in

4003.92 --> 4009.44
America right all the graves with the

4006.319 --> 4012.619
really the red-headed Giants

4009.44 --> 4014.299
with regular other types of humans it

4012.619 --> 4016.4
would always be an uneasy relationship

4014.299 --> 4018.2599999999998
but there could potentially be an

4016.4 --> 4019.64
understanding that they just don't kill

4018.26 --> 4021.619
each other and then there's like a

4019.64 --> 4023.299
marked territory and it's like yeah

4021.619 --> 4025.819
that's giant territory we're not

4023.299 --> 4027.559
supposed to like go into this land

4025.819 --> 4030.38
because that a giant will come out of

4027.559 --> 4033.3190000000004
the woods and start lobbing giant rocks

4030.38 --> 4036.339
at us right that would be kind of what

4033.319 --> 4036.339
it would have been like probably

4044.18 --> 4049.3999999999996
what do you mean Jay no I mean 20 foot

4046.94 --> 4050.96
20 foot Giants at least

4049.4 --> 4053.6600000000003
Jose

4050.96 --> 4056.5
20 foot yeah

4053.66 --> 4056.5
really large

4057.38 --> 4062.44
not just large humans actual Giants

4064.22 --> 4069.9199999999996
and they would have been pretty much

4067.76 --> 4072.38
half Giants

4069.92 --> 4073.52
compared to what There Was Before the

4072.38 --> 4075.7400000000002
Flood

4073.52 --> 4079.28
in the Atlantean times where there were

4075.74 --> 4083.5389999999998
actual real big giants

4079.28 --> 4085.6400000000003
that in my view in my opinion lived

4083.539 --> 4088.9
partially off the energy that were

4085.64 --> 4088.9
created in the pyramids

4088.94 --> 4093.7400000000002
they lived off mana and that's how they

4091.039 --> 4096.5
were able to sustain themselves in and

4093.74 --> 4098.54
growing that large despite being a flesh

4096.5 --> 4100.88
creature

4098.54 --> 4104.08
but yeah they could have been

4100.88 --> 4104.08
who knows how tall

4105.56 --> 4111.52
20 meters more

4108.44 --> 4111.5199999999995
very very large

4115.819 --> 4119.179
do you think controllers have kept giant

4117.859 --> 4120.92
human bones

4119.179 --> 4123.62
while some

4120.92 --> 4126.02
the controllers maybe if they have like

4123.62 --> 4129.259
a fascination with giants of old

4126.02 --> 4131.719
that they know about them they should

4129.259 --> 4134.359
but yeah the majority of it and there

4131.719 --> 4136.58
was a lot of it a lot of giant bones

4134.359 --> 4138.679
that have been found even throughout

4136.58 --> 4140.179
America have been destroyed so most of

4138.679 --> 4142.46
them unfortunately have been destroyed

4140.179 --> 4144.56
but there's probably still

4142.46 --> 4148.4
Graves that haven't been found yet right

4144.56 --> 4150.38
because it's an entire species

4148.4 --> 4153.5599999999995
there were probably much more of them

4150.38 --> 4155.42
than we even realize

4153.56 --> 4158.719
so who knows where we will still find

4155.42 --> 4160.819
giant Graves and there may be some that

4158.719 --> 4162.859
secretly have a vault like ah this is a

4160.819 --> 4165.14
real giant boner

4162.859 --> 4167.2390000000005
and they might even be thinking like oh

4165.14 --> 4169.339
where it's it's supposed to be erased

4167.239 --> 4171.739
from history but we're keeping it safe

4169.339 --> 4174.259
so it's not destroyed

4171.739 --> 4176.919999999999
right there might be some

4174.259 --> 4176.92
out there

4184.1 --> 4189.4400000000005
have I seen the movie troll Hunter yes

4187.699 --> 4192.5
it was funny

4189.44 --> 4195.879999999999
it was pretty cool but definitely not

4192.5 --> 4195.88
real there's no way

4200.12 --> 4204.64
but yeah it's pretty decent CGI

4207.739 --> 4213.218999999999
I mean I had doubts for a few moments

4210.62 --> 4213.219
with that movie

4213.56 --> 4218.6
it makes me want to think like I wish it

4215.96 --> 4222.04
was real that would be really cool

4218.6 --> 4222.04
but it's not real

4241.699 --> 4247.0
Enoch says regular humans feeding the

4244.64 --> 4247.0
Giants

4251.96 --> 4258.38
right well the Giants that weren't like

4255.44 --> 4259.759999999999
being or you could say that weren't wise

4258.38 --> 4262.76
enough

4259.76 --> 4264.62
to actually kind of be breatharians

4262.76 --> 4266.84
because I think that they would have

4264.62 --> 4269.719
been if they had energy from the pyramid

4266.84 --> 4271.88
right if they stayed close to the energy

4269.719 --> 4275.14
it would keep them fed and they wouldn't

4271.88 --> 4275.14
need to constantly eat

4276.92 --> 4281.42
right but that means that if you're an

4280.219 --> 4283.219
outcast

4281.42 --> 4285.02
like let's just say there would have

4283.219 --> 4287.4800000000005
been like a

4285.02 --> 4289.88
a political conflict or something right

4287.48 --> 4292.04
who says that they didn't have any kind

4289.88 --> 4294.86
of politics in Atlantean times and there

4292.04 --> 4297.0199999999995
was a giant that was like no this is bad

4294.86 --> 4299.179
I'm not gonna do that and then they were

4297.02 --> 4300.860000000001
like okay then you're now an outcast and

4299.179 --> 4302.6
they literally just like you're no

4300.86 --> 4304.219
longer allowed here

4302.6 --> 4306.56
and then they would suddenly have to

4304.219 --> 4308.4800000000005
survive without the freaking pyramid

4306.56 --> 4310.46
and then they got really freaking hungry

4308.48 --> 4312.86
and then they might have turned into a

4310.46 --> 4314.36
big problem for everybody right there

4312.86 --> 4316.9
could have been all kinds of situations

4314.36 --> 4316.9
back then

4317.179 --> 4319.3
thank you

4320.659 --> 4326.299999999999
you're recording this

4323.179 --> 4329.86
uh this is a live show it's on YouTube

4326.3 --> 4329.860000000001
why are you recording this

4363.26 --> 4368.0
it would be cool

4365.3 --> 4371.860000000001
humans could attend energy from the Sun

4368.0 --> 4371.86
like a solar cell no it wouldn't

4373.699 --> 4380.259999999999
like we already have that partially

4377.84 --> 4380.26
right

4380.659 --> 4383.32
but

4385.88 --> 4390.38
I mean if you're in very sunny regions

4388.1 --> 4395.320000000001
then you can certainly

4390.38 --> 4395.32
survive on fruit on just eating fruit

4396.8 --> 4401.5
right but it's not never completely

4399.199 --> 4401.5
without

4405.86 --> 4410.299999999999
also I think that probably like the

4408.92 --> 4412.9400000000005
Giants

4410.3 --> 4415.46
that were living off Mana through the

4412.94 --> 4417.799999999999
pyramid energy

4415.46 --> 4419.78
they might have been modified they might

4417.8 --> 4422.0
have been genetically modified to be

4419.78 --> 4425.179
able to do that

4422.0 --> 4426.62
or they were just really wise and very

4425.179 --> 4430.1
disciplined because a lot of those

4426.62 --> 4433.04
giants were likely very very old

4430.1 --> 4434.179
gotta realize that Giants don't get born

4433.04 --> 4437.0
like

4434.179 --> 4440.179
giant size

4437.0 --> 4443.44
they start out kind of human size and

4440.179 --> 4443.4400000000005
then they keep growing

4451.46 --> 4456.699
right that's that's kind of important

4453.56 --> 4456.6990000000005
not to overlook that

4456.86 --> 4462.4
when was this this is like Atlantean

4460.159 --> 4462.4
times

4463.34 --> 4466.2390000000005
pre-flood

4473.239 --> 4477.62
and post plot there's there were still

4475.64 --> 4480.9400000000005
there were still like what I call half

4477.62 --> 4480.94
Giants post flood

4482.96 --> 4487.1
we're like in between

4484.94 --> 4489.46
and they wouldn't like keep growing

4487.1 --> 4489.46
forever

4490.04 --> 4496.64
and that's where we get like the the big

4493.239 --> 4499.0599999999995
20-foot redhead Giants for example and

4496.64 --> 4499.06
others

4501.98 --> 4506.599999999999
and that that brick red-haired giant

4504.92 --> 4509.96
that was encountered in Afghanistan

4506.6 --> 4513.860000000001
remember that the U.S military

4509.96 --> 4518.32
had a run-in with a giant

4513.86 --> 4518.32
what was that in 2004 or something

4542.179 --> 4547.04
psych bear

4543.86 --> 4551.139999999999
people live off only from well that

4547.04 --> 4551.14
would probably be the brevarians

4551.36 --> 4555.44
psych bear

4553.28 --> 4557.42
or they say sunlight but it is

4555.44 --> 4561.099999999999
effectively Mana

4557.42 --> 4561.1
but you still need sunlight

4575.36 --> 4578.679
the most part no

4579.62 --> 4581.739
thank you

4591.56 --> 4595.400000000001
they must have been there well they

4593.719 --> 4598.1
might have been kind of different

4595.4 --> 4601.879999999999
borders but it's makes sense

4598.1 --> 4603.92
because we're all descended from the

4601.88 --> 4607.12
ultimate giant which was Adam the

4603.92 --> 4607.12
largest humanoid ever

4607.219 --> 4612.44
the physiology might be different

4609.44 --> 4612.44
slightly

4614.12 --> 4620.36
but also the conditions the terrestrial

4617.54 --> 4624.5199999999995
conditions were also different

4620.36 --> 4629.32
right so there was thicker atmosphere

4624.52 --> 4629.320000000001
and richer in oxygen

4629.36 --> 4634.159
that makes like regeneration capacity a

4632.54 --> 4637.82
lot more

4634.159 --> 4640.04
right so then that would offset the

4637.82 --> 4644.0
physical suffering under your own weight

4640.04 --> 4646.5199999999995
which literally strains it it causes

4644.0 --> 4648.38
this damage on the cellular level that's

4646.52 --> 4651.38
strain well if you then have like

4648.38 --> 4654.26
massive regeneration capacity thanks to

4651.38 --> 4656.3
like the rich oxygen in the air and all

4654.26 --> 4658.820000000001
that then

4656.3 --> 4661.219
you wouldn't just become [ __ ] and die

4658.82 --> 4664.28
eventually as a giant

4661.219 --> 4666.92
you would be able to yeah

4664.28 --> 4669.94
repair everything just being a giant

4666.92 --> 4669.9400000000005
would be survivable

4671.239 --> 4676.099999999999
so what happened to the come on what

4673.88 --> 4678.7390000000005
kind of a question is that why don't you

4676.1 --> 4681.64
answer that question it's so blatantly

4678.739 --> 4681.639999999999
obvious what happened

4683.719 --> 4688.58
did Giants build the pyramids I think

4685.88 --> 4692.719
that they definitely helped out

4688.58 --> 4695.5599999999995
they probably helped carry huge huge

4692.719 --> 4695.56
pieces of stone

4696.02 --> 4700.34
that they couldn't just like cast

4698.179 --> 4703.12
because a lot of the pyramid is just

4700.34 --> 4703.12
cast stone

4703.94 --> 4709.46
they literally make it on the spot

4706.46 --> 4712.82
but there are very specific

4709.46 --> 4715.58
Parts integral parts of the pyramid

4712.82 --> 4718.28
types of rock that are like completely

4715.58 --> 4721.54
as is they literally just dug it out of

4718.28 --> 4721.54
a quarry and then had to

4722.26 --> 4727.1
transported Unbroken

4725.179 --> 4729.32
and there's no equipment that could ever

4727.1 --> 4731.54
do that even modern equipment couldn't

4729.32 --> 4734.36
do that but they had really freaking

4731.54 --> 4737.06
large Giants and they could together do

4734.36 --> 4739.54
that it would literally just carry it

4737.06 --> 4739.54
all the way

4754.52 --> 4760.280000000001
we had a valve insector yeah borders boy

4757.64 --> 4761.4800000000005
but look we all have that we already

4760.28 --> 4763.94
have that

4761.48 --> 4765.44
our blood vessels have that kind of

4763.94 --> 4767.48
thing

4765.44 --> 4771.139999999999
valves

4767.48 --> 4773.12
our heart has a valve so yeah they're

4771.14 --> 4775.280000000001
it's all there it would have just been

4773.12 --> 4778.0
bigger and had to be stronger and all

4775.28 --> 4778.0
that that's all

4778.1 --> 4780.9400000000005
in Giants

4843.56 --> 4845.7390000000005
foreign

4859.1 --> 4865.58
they cut rock with water

4863.06 --> 4867.320000000001
okay guys well they used all kinds of

4865.58 --> 4872.26
techniques

4867.32 --> 4872.259999999999
right they also used Sonic Drilling

4873.679 --> 4880.219
sound based drilling yeah

4877.46 --> 4882.52
it's all kinds of very

4880.219 --> 4884.9
very sophisticated

4882.52 --> 4886.280000000001
stone-based engineering very

4884.9 --> 4888.98
sophisticated

4886.28 --> 4890.78
but they also used Stone casting

4888.98 --> 4894.379999999999
literally

4890.78 --> 4897.0199999999995
like casting concrete except it's it's

4894.38 --> 4898.9400000000005
like limestone

4897.02 --> 4902.900000000001
and other types

4898.94 --> 4906.379999999999
perhaps right so they didn't like

4902.9 --> 4908.799999999999
just carry every freaking part of the

4906.38 --> 4908.8
pyramid

4908.9 --> 4914.719
they just cast a whole bunch of it but

4911.239 --> 4917.299999999999
there were key stones that were intrical

4914.719 --> 4919.76
to like the actual electric functioning

4917.3 --> 4923.3
of it that can't be cast

4919.76 --> 4925.52
so they had to carry that [ __ ]

4923.3 --> 4929.08
in one piece

4925.52 --> 4929.080000000001
that's where the Giants come in

4934.46 --> 4937.46
Giants took big dumps you don't know

4936.44 --> 4941.54
that

4937.46 --> 4943.58
well yeah they probably would

4941.54 --> 4945.92
but who says they even needed to eat

4943.58 --> 4948.8
that much right

4945.92 --> 4951.62
big dumps means big digestion did they

4948.8 --> 4954.320000000001
eat that much did they need to or were

4951.62 --> 4957.199
they like breatharians

4954.32 --> 4959.96
only needed food occasionally for like

4957.199 --> 4960.919999999999
very specific nutrients and vitamins or

4959.96 --> 4963.4
something

4960.92 --> 4963.4
right

4969.8 --> 4974.06
could it be the brakes were poor yeah it

4973.159 --> 4976.5199999999995
was

4974.06 --> 4977.900000000001
it's not could it be that's absolutely a

4976.52 --> 4980.540000000001
necessity

4977.9 --> 4984.98
there's no way that it would be viable

4980.54 --> 4988.28
to just carry around giant rocks

4984.98 --> 4990.98
and like endless amounts of them endless

4988.28 --> 4994.04
amounts of giant rocks there's just no

4990.98 --> 4996.86
viable way that could ever work

4994.04 --> 5000.6
even with giants that would be insane

4996.86 --> 5000.599999999999
too much too much work

5000.76 --> 5006.1
most of it was cast like geopolymers

5003.88 --> 5009.1
exactly

5006.1 --> 5013.56
but certain parts the inside of the

5009.1 --> 5013.56
pyramid were not cast They had to be

5013.78 --> 5019.679
cut out of a Groove and then transported

5016.9 --> 5019.679
in one piece

5020.92 --> 5024.9
I can only think of giants

5025.719 --> 5029.4
to to be able to do that

5036.34 --> 5041.08
there were smaller no not dinosaurs

5039.219 --> 5043.56
reptiles

5041.08 --> 5043.5599999999995
dragons

5043.96 --> 5048.76
no dinosaur dinosaur is a fictional

5046.239 --> 5051.759999999999
construct

5048.76 --> 5054.900000000001
intricately tied in the name itself is

5051.76 --> 5058.38
literally even culturally tied in with

5054.9 --> 5060.159
ancient amounts of time ago

5058.38 --> 5064.06
pre-man

5060.159 --> 5067.32
yeah oh wait there is no pre-man yeah

5064.06 --> 5067.320000000001
that's part of the point

5118.3 --> 5120.96
one

5126.46 --> 5129.54
I don't get it

5137.62 --> 5143.08
he's just turning around that rock so

5140.38 --> 5145.86
what's the point how is that moving it's

5143.08 --> 5145.86
just turning it

5154.78 --> 5161.5199999999995
yeah that's not lifting that's literally

5157.48 --> 5161.5199999999995
like dragging it around

5164.92 --> 5171.54
I don't see the rock actually coming off

5168.159 --> 5171.54
the ground at any point there

5171.58 --> 5174.42
borders boy

5183.82 --> 5187.719
okay well Gadget inspector that's your

5186.159 --> 5189.219
freaking problem if you don't want to

5187.719 --> 5192.78
believe it then you don't believe it

5189.219 --> 5192.78
fine don't believe it

5200.44 --> 5205.9
I mean I don't think it's very

5202.719 --> 5207.52
intelligent to build a freaking Pyramid

5205.9 --> 5211.719
of Giza

5207.52 --> 5213.580000000001
all with man over time just men oh very

5211.719 --> 5215.9800000000005
resortful yeah well it's not just

5213.58 --> 5218.32
resourcefulness that's the issue

5215.98 --> 5222.28
the issue is the sheer freaking amount

5218.32 --> 5225.46
of quantity of what's actually part

5222.28 --> 5228.099999999999
of the pyramid there it's like too much

5225.46 --> 5232.54
it's too much it would take too much

5228.1 --> 5234.219
time why would any intelligent person or

5232.54 --> 5236.62
group of people

5234.219 --> 5238.4800000000005
build all that

5236.62 --> 5241.0199999999995
unless they could do it extremely

5238.48 --> 5241.0199999999995
quickly

5241.719 --> 5246.82
there's no that's not intelligent it's

5244.179 --> 5250.659
not intelligent to build something

5246.82 --> 5253.239
that's just way out of your reach

5250.659 --> 5255.659
that's too big

5253.239 --> 5259.54
that's not smart that's literally

5255.659 --> 5262.719
wasting several Generations lifetimes on

5259.54 --> 5265.26
something what does it even do why would

5262.719 --> 5265.26
you do that

5266.38 --> 5271.2390000000005
unless it could be billed relatively

5268.9 --> 5273.699
quickly well the only way it could have

5271.239 --> 5278.44
been built very quickly is if giants

5273.699 --> 5281.98
were involved to drag the insane large

5278.44 --> 5284.32
rocks that are several tons

5281.98 --> 5286.199
right there's not the hundreds of kill

5284.32 --> 5289.0599999999995
no tons

5286.199 --> 5290.86
several tons

5289.06 --> 5295.139
I don't know how heavy it was like maybe

5290.86 --> 5298.92
like 10 or tons One Singular Rock

5295.139 --> 5302.679
there's no logical reason

5298.92 --> 5307.54
why humans would just like they would

5302.679 --> 5309.159
take freaking years years and hundreds

5307.54 --> 5311.92
of people

5309.159 --> 5315.28
and just endless amounts of

5311.92 --> 5318.36
pain and effort years to just freaking

5315.28 --> 5322.3
transport one rock

5318.36 --> 5324.099999999999
no logical reason no logical reason to

5322.3 --> 5326.02
do that whatsoever

5324.1 --> 5329.02
unless there were freaking Giants and

5326.02 --> 5332.320000000001
then you could do it in half a year

5329.02 --> 5335.620000000001
half a year all you'd need to do

5332.32 --> 5337.239
is have a bunch of people a big Caravan

5335.62 --> 5339.5199999999995
with a lot of food

5337.239 --> 5341.259999999999
to support the Giants while they

5339.52 --> 5343.4800000000005
transport that thing

5341.26 --> 5346.42
in only half a year

5343.48 --> 5349.138999999999
that's it that's actually a worthwhile

5346.42 --> 5349.139
investment

5351.34 --> 5357.9400000000005
right there's no logical reason why it

5354.34 --> 5362.38
was only humans it's intangible it is in

5357.94 --> 5364.96
town it's right now in tangible okay

5362.38 --> 5366.88
with everything we got right now it's

5364.96 --> 5370.26
impossible

5366.88 --> 5374.8
why would you think that

5370.26 --> 5377.9800000000005
several Millennia ago it was possible

5374.8 --> 5379.900000000001
without Giants it's not there's no

5377.98 --> 5381.759999999999
logical reason

5379.9 --> 5386.44
just

5381.76 --> 5388.84
using no no Gadget inspector no

5386.44 --> 5392.32
you're talking about the Assembly of the

5388.84 --> 5396.88
pyramid I'm talking about the transport

5392.32 --> 5398.5199999999995
of singular pieces of stone

5396.88 --> 5402.159000000001
that were

5398.52 --> 5403.659000000001
10 tons or more I don't even numerically

5402.159 --> 5405.46
I'm kind of like I don't know where it

5403.659 --> 5408.82
is it could be a hundred tons I don't

5405.46 --> 5411.159
know they're [ __ ] insane

5408.82 --> 5416.08
you don't just build a couple of ramps

5411.159 --> 5417.58
to transport a hundred ton Rock makes no

5416.08 --> 5422.44
[ __ ] sense

5417.58 --> 5426.46
you couldn't even build like a modern

5422.44 --> 5428.32
like concrete German type road to

5426.46 --> 5431.02
freaking transport of the rock like that

5428.32 --> 5433.239
it's just impossible

5431.02 --> 5436.320000000001
it's impossible

5433.239 --> 5436.32
can't do that

5438.34 --> 5443.08
how tall do I think these Giants were at

5440.86 --> 5448.679
least 20 meters tall

5443.08 --> 5448.679
20 meters not feet meters at least

5454.42 --> 5457.659
what kind of beasts of Burden do you

5456.4 --> 5460.739
think they use to help build the

5457.659 --> 5460.739
pyramids Giants

5461.26 --> 5466.719
right and for like rough material

5463.42 --> 5469.3
probably like I don't know mules

5466.719 --> 5471.639
because they just needed the powder a

5469.3 --> 5475.0
lot of powder transport right

5471.639 --> 5476.679
put the powder in get the water

5475.0 --> 5478.719
or whatever they use I think it was

5476.679 --> 5480.58
water and then they literally create the

5478.719 --> 5482.86
Limestone right which is like the vast

5480.58 --> 5484.9
majority of what the pyramid is

5482.86 --> 5487.659
basically they just needed powder and

5484.9 --> 5489.839999999999
water transport something like that

5487.659 --> 5494.08
but that still doesn't solve the

5489.84 --> 5495.46
singular rocks that were like multitude

5494.08 --> 5497.08
of tons

5495.46 --> 5500.02
heavy

5497.08 --> 5502.239
there's no mule or anything like you

5500.02 --> 5504.280000000001
couldn't have like a hundred thousand

5502.239 --> 5506.919999999999
mules couldn't pull a rock like that

5504.28 --> 5509.5599999999995
okay a hundred thousand

5506.92 --> 5513.88
couldn't make a singular

5509.56 --> 5516.360000000001
centimeter movement in a rock like that

5513.88 --> 5516.36
right

5521.26 --> 5528.76
boats what what kind of boat could carry

5524.86 --> 5531.82
a hundred thousand ton Rock

5528.76 --> 5536.1
even a modern oil tanker couldn't even

5531.82 --> 5536.099999999999
they would literally break in two

5536.92 --> 5541.78
no way

5539.159 --> 5545.379999999999
no way

5541.78 --> 5547.84
it's impossible mechanically impossible

5545.38 --> 5549.82
keep dreaming keep dreaming how humans

5547.84 --> 5551.08
were resourceful enough to do it no they

5549.82 --> 5554.139
weren't

5551.08 --> 5555.76
it's impossible it's impossible right

5554.139 --> 5557.4400000000005
now

5555.76 --> 5561.52
why would you think it would have been

5557.44 --> 5564.719
possible with only humans back then why

5561.52 --> 5564.719
makes no sense

5592.06 --> 5596.34
all right I'm going to take a two minute

5593.44 --> 5596.339999999999
break I'll be right back

5596.86 --> 5598.98
okay

5677.38 --> 5680.159000000001
thank you

5680.56 --> 5682.8
foreign

5685.06 --> 5689.9800000000005
what's that

5687.28 --> 5691.48
oh yeah thank you for that yeah Godzilla

5689.98 --> 5693.718999999999
you don't need to time that out just ban

5691.48 --> 5693.718999999999
it

5693.76 --> 5696.780000000001
thank you for that

5703.84 --> 5706.32
oh

5734.38 --> 5736.5
okay

5756.82 --> 5760.739
man it's kind of kind of cold here

5760.78 --> 5763.44
this

5772.659 --> 5778.219999999999
is the actual temperature I think it's

5775.42 --> 5780.82
probably a lot colder than it looks

5778.22 --> 5783.659000000001
[Applause]

5780.82 --> 5783.659
nine degrees

5785.38 --> 5788.82
yes not warm

5794.8 --> 5797.46
ah

5808.78 --> 5814.0
you can't know they exist well what if

5811.54 --> 5815.739
you actually got to meet one at one

5814.0 --> 5819.28
point I think there's probably still

5815.739 --> 5821.619
plenty of half Giants around

5819.28 --> 5825.46
I mean there's no

5821.619 --> 5828.46
full Giants of old like the

5825.46 --> 5830.619
Atlantean giant those don't exist

5828.46 --> 5832.659
anymore they would have all drowned

5830.619 --> 5835.299999999999
in the flood

5832.659 --> 5838.42
when the pyramids were basically no

5835.3 --> 5840.52
longer functioning no longer outputting

5838.42 --> 5842.92
the Mana energy they needed to survive

5840.52 --> 5845.56
they would have just like succumbed to

5842.92 --> 5847.9
weakness and drown very quickly

5845.56 --> 5849.280000000001
but the half Giants a lot of them did

5847.9 --> 5852.4
survive

5849.28 --> 5854.8
they weren't dependent on that

5852.4 --> 5858.159
and they've still been around afterward

5854.8 --> 5861.52
although they got hunted down

5858.159 --> 5864.54
why did yeah the new human Empires that

5861.52 --> 5864.540000000001
came after the flood

5871.78 --> 5876.34
our people today still finding skeletons

5874.42 --> 5877.96
of giant humans

5876.34 --> 5880.719
Maybe

5877.96 --> 5883.2390000000005
but they should stop looking though

5880.719 --> 5885.04
they they really should because as soon

5883.239 --> 5886.78
as you find something like that oh you

5885.04 --> 5889.0
can have your moment of Fame and then

5886.78 --> 5892.3
literally

5889.0 --> 5894.58
like the baddies move in and destroy it

5892.3 --> 5895.360000000001
and they'll destroy it right in front of

5894.58 --> 5898.6
you

5895.36 --> 5901.659
if you push it yeah

5898.6 --> 5903.58
it's going to give people eventually

5901.659 --> 5905.32
that do that sort of that have even the

5903.58 --> 5907.84
talent to find that sort of stuff that

5905.32 --> 5911.099999999999
like hey maybe we shouldn't actually

5907.84 --> 5915.28
discover that because it gets destroyed

5911.1 --> 5917.860000000001
every time we do that yeah so I'm

5915.28 --> 5919.659
definitely not encouraging anybody to

5917.86 --> 5923.5599999999995
find giant Graves

5919.659 --> 5927.46
we first have to annihilate this satanic

5923.56 --> 5929.860000000001
Spirit that's right now ruling our world

5927.46 --> 5933.36
because every time we dug up anything

5929.86 --> 5937.119
like that it's going to be destroyed

5933.36 --> 5939.699
utterly destroyed yeah

5937.119 --> 5943.92
if it doesn't fit

5939.699 --> 5946.839999999999
the satanic dream scenario they will

5943.92 --> 5949.42
destroy it

5946.84 --> 5951.9400000000005
so don't go out and look for giant

5949.42 --> 5954.2390000000005
Graves you will guarantee its

5951.94 --> 5954.239
destruction

5955.179 --> 5958.139
don't do that

5961.96 --> 5969.4
yeah like literally don't do that

5965.98 --> 5972.159
don't even do it to try to keep it safe

5969.4 --> 5974.619
no you will not keep it safe you will be

5972.159 --> 5977.5
found out and then it will be destroyed

5974.619 --> 5979.659
again you understand you can't find it

5977.5 --> 5981.52
and keep it safe you will be found out

5979.659 --> 5984.219
you will be discovered and then it will

5981.52 --> 5987.580000000001
be destroyed don't go out and look for

5984.219 --> 5990.58
it don't leave it alone

5987.58 --> 5994.3
[ __ ] your proof [ __ ] your Fame

5990.58 --> 5997.86
leave the giant remains alone don't try

5994.3 --> 5997.860000000001
and go find them don't

6000.36 --> 6002.54
foreign

6009.38 --> 6016.8
is literally destroying knowledge for

6013.44 --> 6019.08
Satan when you do that you understand

6016.8 --> 6021.42
you go out and find giant points you're

6019.08 --> 6024.0599999999995
literally helping Satan

6021.42 --> 6027.42
to destroy the truth

6024.06 --> 6030.4800000000005
you understand don't [ __ ] do it

6027.42 --> 6032.58
not even to keep it a secret don't do it

6030.48 --> 6035.48
just don't

6032.58 --> 6035.48
leave it alone

6039.36 --> 6044.82
like I'd Almost Say

6042.119 --> 6046.98
if you find like a really awesome giant

6044.82 --> 6048.599999999999
site

6046.98 --> 6051.0599999999995
somewhere

6048.6 --> 6053.04
like just bury it in concrete or

6051.06 --> 6054.719
something just make it completely

6053.04 --> 6057.6
unattainable

6054.719 --> 6060.3
right buried in concrete

6057.6 --> 6062.52
and just say it's something else say

6060.3 --> 6064.5
like whatever was there maybe it's

6062.52 --> 6067.619000000001
something really poison whatever

6064.5 --> 6070.199
literally buried in concrete right it's

6067.619 --> 6072.36
not gonna get destroyed that way it's

6070.199 --> 6075.0
literally another form of casket that

6072.36 --> 6077.759999999999
people aren't like gonna they're not

6075.0 --> 6079.92
gonna dig into that

6077.76 --> 6082.9800000000005
just to destroy it

6079.92 --> 6084.659
because who's gonna reach in there to

6082.98 --> 6086.28
see it right

6084.659 --> 6089.04
so yeah

6086.28 --> 6091.32
that's what I would do

6089.04 --> 6094.08
but the best way is to just let

6091.32 --> 6096.36
literally don't go out and find try to

6094.08 --> 6099.26
find that it's only gonna get destroyed

6096.36 --> 6099.259999999999
so unless you're

6100.08 --> 6106.5
doing it to make a point

6103.619 --> 6109.0199999999995
get a little sized up and then literally

6106.5 --> 6112.38
bury it all under concrete so that

6109.02 --> 6116.280000000001
literally nobody can destroy it maybe

6112.38 --> 6118.02
but still yeah you don't know right

6116.28 --> 6120.0
they really want to destroy they'll

6118.02 --> 6122.040000000001
probably just send like a freaking

6120.0 --> 6124.5
bunker Buster in there and just shatter

6122.04 --> 6126.6
the whole thing whatever

6124.5 --> 6128.4
I don't know I don't know what how far

6126.6 --> 6130.639
they would go into destroying the

6128.4 --> 6130.638999999999
evidence

6130.8 --> 6136.4400000000005
my best tip is to just just leave it

6133.86 --> 6140.48
alone don't go out and look for it it's

6136.44 --> 6140.48
only gonna get destroyed in this age

6143.04 --> 6145.76
that's right

6148.8 --> 6153.360000000001
that's right Rufus say it happens no

6151.32 --> 6155.699
digging for Giants until the satanists

6153.36 --> 6157.739
are destroyed banished

6155.699 --> 6160.08
right

6157.739 --> 6162.54
it's not so much the sataness it's the

6160.08 --> 6165.38
spirit until the spirit can no longer

6162.54 --> 6165.38
grab anybody

6166.139 --> 6170.639
right because as long as the spirit is

6168.36 --> 6174.0
still there has a grip it's just gonna

6170.639 --> 6177.4800000000005
jump from one person to another

6174.0 --> 6181.76
now the spirit itself has to be banned

6177.48 --> 6181.759999999999
banished to be more precise

6194.1 --> 6197.0
oh that's cool

6198.0 --> 6203.96
your wife was six foot two that's really

6200.34 --> 6203.96
large how big are you

6211.02 --> 6214.6990000000005
how big are you bored as a boy

6222.0 --> 6227.06
no concrete is not indestructible and it

6224.58 --> 6227.0599999999995
was only

6227.719 --> 6234.0
giving a rough description right

6231.36 --> 6237.839999999999
point is is that if it's just available

6234.0 --> 6239.699
like oh look look at this site

6237.84 --> 6241.1990000000005
right oh look at these giant bones you

6239.699 --> 6244.619
could just come in as a visitor and look

6241.199 --> 6247.379999999999
at it right then freaking Smithsonian is

6244.619 --> 6249.599999999999
gonna come in and start like making up

6247.38 --> 6251.2390000000005
an excuse like oh it's radioactive oh we

6249.6 --> 6253.56
have to get it

6251.239 --> 6255.178999999999
emergency uh we're taking we're

6253.56 --> 6259.02
confiscating it all right that's gonna

6255.179 --> 6262.7390000000005
happen when I say bury under concrete

6259.02 --> 6265.080000000001
I just mean it's like another casket to

6262.739 --> 6267.299999999999
ensure that they don't come in and do

6265.08 --> 6271.159
that right because are they really gonna

6267.3 --> 6271.159000000001
dig into all that concrete

6272.34 --> 6277.32
I mean nobody's gonna be seeing it if

6275.4 --> 6279.36
it's buried under concrete you see but

6277.32 --> 6281.34
it won't be destroyed for future

6279.36 --> 6284.159
reference so they might leave it alone

6281.34 --> 6288.08
I've just I'm just trying to spitball

6284.159 --> 6288.08
figure my way out of this

6297.0 --> 6302.28
it would be cool if a museum had a giant

6299.58 --> 6305.0
on this plate okay that's cool

6302.28 --> 6307.04
well then first you got a completely

6305.0 --> 6310.04
revolutionized Museum

6307.04 --> 6313.56
and literally have the entire

6310.04 --> 6316.1
Smithsonian Institute this Bandit and

6313.56 --> 6316.1
arrested

6316.139 --> 6319.8
and like all their secret basements dug

6319.02 --> 6322.56
out

6319.8 --> 6325.4400000000005
because undoubtedly they're involved in

6322.56 --> 6328.56
really [ __ ] up satanic stuff

6325.44 --> 6331.919999999999
probably also the whole

6328.56 --> 6334.02
pedo [ __ ] no doubt like if you're dark

6331.92 --> 6336.0
enough to do all that then you're gonna

6334.02 --> 6337.320000000001
be involved in that [ __ ] as well no

6336.0 --> 6340.219
doubt

6337.32 --> 6343.0199999999995
right so first the entire Museum

6340.219 --> 6346.199
apparatus that's been doing all this

6343.02 --> 6347.88
would have to be rolled up

6346.199 --> 6351.0599999999995
and like

6347.88 --> 6354.42
this Bandit like you are no longer

6351.06 --> 6356.400000000001
allowed to ever come near

6354.42 --> 6357.4800000000005
anything that's older than a hundred

6356.4 --> 6359.96
years

6357.48 --> 6359.959999999999
ever

6363.36 --> 6368.219
right you'd have to like

6365.88 --> 6371.58
yeah make sure that they cannot operate

6368.219 --> 6374.639
like that anymore and then then maybe

6371.58 --> 6376.8
one day you would be able to have an

6374.639 --> 6380.46
actual Giant in a museum that's actually

6376.8 --> 6383.820000000001
really a giant and not just a

6380.46 --> 6386.36
a chicken bone constructed nonsense

6383.82 --> 6386.36
skeleton

6390.119 --> 6395.9
what Satan doesn't have to do with

6392.28 --> 6400.139
Satanism yeah it is not the religion

6395.9 --> 6401.94
Satanism it's not like oh worship this

6400.139 --> 6404.1
chant that that's not what I'm talking

6401.94 --> 6406.619
about when I say Satanism when I say

6404.1 --> 6408.3
Satanism I mean

6406.619 --> 6411.9
the spirit

6408.3 --> 6415.58
that drives the Reversed world and that

6411.9 --> 6419.82
destroys Truth for profit and control

6415.58 --> 6422.699
yeah that's Satanism destroying Truth

6419.82 --> 6425.219
for profit and control

6422.699 --> 6427.219
on a verbal level and on a physical

6425.219 --> 6430.5
evidence level that's what they do

6427.219 --> 6435.42
that's what it is

6430.5 --> 6437.88
destroy Truth for profit and control

6435.42 --> 6440.4
that's what I mean when I say Satanism

6437.88 --> 6443.06
not some stupid little squirt boy

6440.4 --> 6443.0599999999995
religion

6450.659 --> 6454.619
can you give an example I already have

6452.82 --> 6458.04
dick

6454.619 --> 6460.259999999999
did you go demented again

6458.04 --> 6462.659
you've been here this entire show right

6460.26 --> 6465.900000000001
you've already given you examples

6462.659 --> 6468.54
yeah single example Etc example would be

6465.9 --> 6470.719
the Smithsonian coming into a giant

6468.54 --> 6472.94
grave find

6470.719 --> 6475.32
and then literally

6472.94 --> 6479.04
confiscating it all threatening maybe

6475.32 --> 6482.88
killing and then literally destroying

6479.04 --> 6487.139
all the bones on record in freaking

6482.88 --> 6492.42
newspapers okay in newspapers American

6487.139 --> 6492.42
newspapers from the 19th century yeah

6493.8 --> 6501.02
literally

6496.44 --> 6501.0199999999995
yeah that's the evidence they do that

6512.4 --> 6515.54
[ __ ] off Jose

6524.52 --> 6528.679
I mean really [ __ ] off Jose

6529.32 --> 6534.719
there's giant amounts of evidence for

6532.32 --> 6537.54
Giants and the destruction of evidence

6534.719 --> 6539.639
for that in newspapers officially

6537.54 --> 6543.42
registered newspapers that aren't going

6539.639 --> 6545.82
to be deleted they can't be deleted

6543.42 --> 6549.8
they're there they're online you can

6545.82 --> 6549.799999999999
literally find them dick

6561.599 --> 6564.1990000000005
okay

6582.48 --> 6589.098999999999
yeah try again in five minutes unless I

6585.42 --> 6589.099
round out the show by then

6604.679 --> 6609.78
they faked the dinosaurs in newspaper

6607.56 --> 6611.9400000000005
yeah but that's actually provable that

6609.78 --> 6616.04
that's fake

6611.94 --> 6616.04
the entire premise is ridiculous

6621.9 --> 6629.159
what you really think get are you that

6625.38 --> 6631.619
deeply sunk into nonsense world that you

6629.159 --> 6634.5
would be willing you're like you have

6631.619 --> 6637.08
you seem to have like a will to not

6634.5 --> 6638.94
believe Giants exist and there's the out

6637.08 --> 6641.3
there I I call it it's like a Grappler

6638.94 --> 6647.28
Instinct grabblers

6641.3 --> 6650.900000000001
hate Giants hate them they hate them

6647.28 --> 6650.9
why because they're little

6658.44 --> 6664.379999999999
so if you don't want to believe Giants

6661.32 --> 6666.5599999999995
you might have a bit of Grappler Gene in

6664.38 --> 6666.56
you

6676.619 --> 6682.799999999999
giant bones were absolutely found and

6679.98 --> 6688.58
destroyed and reported on destroyed

6682.8 --> 6688.58
why you think that why would that happen

6688.619 --> 6694.44
just to make belief make belief about

6692.219 --> 6696.9
how Giants exist

6694.44 --> 6700.44
think that newspapers would troll you

6696.9 --> 6703.92
just to make believe Giants

6700.44 --> 6705.659
when there's so much of it out there and

6703.92 --> 6708.84
there's so many things that have been

6705.659 --> 6710.759999999999
described like how I even reason out

6708.84 --> 6713.46
with the pyramids you can't build the

6710.76 --> 6716.76
pyramids without Giants you can't do it

6713.46 --> 6719.76
right now right now with modern

6716.76 --> 6722.280000000001
technology you can't do that you can't

6719.76 --> 6725.04
do that with like the entire budget of

6722.28 --> 6727.86
the world you can't do it right now you

6725.04 --> 6730.619
can't do it you get it right now you

6727.86 --> 6734.58
can't do it the entire Humanity United

6730.619 --> 6739.739
right now to build a Giza Pyramid they

6734.58 --> 6742.739
couldn't do it you get it already

6739.739 --> 6746.459999999999
they can't do it

6742.739 --> 6748.138999999999
you need Giants you get it already you

6746.46 --> 6751.139
can't do it you can't do it without

6748.139 --> 6754.9800000000005
Giants Giants have to exist

6751.139 --> 6757.86
they can't have not existed they existed

6754.98 --> 6760.739
they had to things that exist right now

6757.86 --> 6763.86
couldn't exist without Giants having

6760.739 --> 6765.718999999999
existed you get it already they exist

6763.86 --> 6767.82
get over it

6765.719 --> 6768.659
get a grip on your Grappler Instinct

6767.82 --> 6771.48
there

6768.659 --> 6773.46
yes you are not the biggest thing in the

6771.48 --> 6777.0599999999995
freaking universe

6773.46 --> 6778.86
yeah you're not the evolved species

6777.06 --> 6782.34
none of us are

6778.86 --> 6785.82
we were all bigger all of us there were

6782.34 --> 6788.34
giants we were bigger our ancestors were

6785.82 --> 6792.08
bigger you have to freaking get over it

6788.34 --> 6792.08
it's not gonna be the other way around

6796.739 --> 6800.459999999999
the Giants have huge brains and

6798.599 --> 6803.3
intelligence

6800.46 --> 6803.3
potentially

6803.699 --> 6806.299999999999
yes

6807.78 --> 6814.08
right take yeah they might have had

6810.84 --> 6816.900000000001
unbelievable capacity

6814.08 --> 6819.239
for wisdom and intelligence

6816.9 --> 6822.839999999999
I mean if you're going to be able to

6819.239 --> 6825.44
live off Mana you already have to have a

6822.84 --> 6825.4400000000005
certain level

6826.08 --> 6832.0199999999995
but we don't know I don't know if

6829.44 --> 6834.598999999999
that intelligence with that giant brain

6832.02 --> 6836.820000000001
that they had would be even about

6834.599 --> 6839.28
cognition

6836.82 --> 6841.619
what that intelligence be cognition

6839.28 --> 6844.8
would if they have been great speakers

6841.619 --> 6849.36
automatically or were they just like

6844.8 --> 6851.52
really really focused with instinct

6849.36 --> 6853.799999999999
right they might have been like that

6851.52 --> 6855.84
they could barely speak but they could

6853.8 --> 6858.119000000001
have been absolutely brilliant in

6855.84 --> 6862.139
figuring things out

6858.119 --> 6864.119
or just like literally just oh and heal

6862.139 --> 6865.619
like an entire group of people just like

6864.119 --> 6868.0199999999995
that oh

6865.619 --> 6869.82
they could have had incredible talents

6868.02 --> 6872.52
doesn't necessarily have to be like

6869.82 --> 6875.88
smarts figuring things out intelligence

6872.52 --> 6877.9800000000005
or great speech skills

6875.88 --> 6880.619
but yeah if you have a big brain

6877.98 --> 6882.9
physically big chunk of brain then there

6880.619 --> 6885.48
are potentially amazing things that

6882.9 --> 6886.739
could be achieved just like elephants

6885.48 --> 6888.799999999999
right

6886.739 --> 6891.78
elephants have a sophisticated

6888.8 --> 6893.52
intelligence they do

6891.78 --> 6897.48
it just

6893.52 --> 6900.2390000000005
they seem to focus mostly on wisdom and

6897.48 --> 6902.339999999999
Stress Management right stress is a

6900.239 --> 6904.259999999999
really big thing for Elephants because

6902.34 --> 6906.4800000000005
they're big

6904.26 --> 6908.76
so they are physically under stress and

6906.48 --> 6911.638999999999
they're very emotional creatures

6908.76 --> 6913.7390000000005
you can see that in their youngs so they

6911.639 --> 6918.4800000000005
have to like use all their intelligence

6913.739 --> 6922.58
for wisdom just to survive

6918.48 --> 6922.58
so yeah hope that answers the question

6937.02 --> 6942.2390000000005
yeah don't tell me what to do Bev

6940.08 --> 6944.76
you get it

6942.239 --> 6946.919999999999
don't tell me what to do

6944.76 --> 6948.360000000001
I timed Jose out because he was getting

6946.92 --> 6950.219
on my nerve

6948.36 --> 6952.92
it was not

6950.219 --> 6956.46
rolling out anything interesting he was

6952.92 --> 6957.719
just being a needlessly skeptic ignorant

6956.46 --> 6960.54
idiot

6957.719 --> 6963.06
so I timed him out

6960.54 --> 6964.8
yeah I don't need any advice on how to

6963.06 --> 6966.659000000001
do my show Beth

6964.8 --> 6970.08
yeah if you're going to be here for that

6966.659 --> 6972.96
then you may just want to leave

6970.08 --> 6978.26
unless you got something interesting to

6972.96 --> 6978.26
say not about how I do my show huh

6980.099 --> 6985.26
yeah I don't need that suggestion yeah I

6982.739 --> 6989.0
don't need any suggestion on how to how

6985.26 --> 6989.0
to manage my show Bev thanks

6993.58 --> 6996.939
[Music]

7001.639 --> 7006.32
now your opinion about Giants was so

7004.159 --> 7008.36
obsessed in nature Jose and I do not

7006.32 --> 7011.36
respect that and you were literally

7008.36 --> 7012.86
breaking the energy in the air you were

7011.36 --> 7015.08
breaking the discussion

7012.86 --> 7017.0599999999995
and timed you out

7015.08 --> 7020.32
you don't like it oh

7017.06 --> 7020.320000000001
who gives a [ __ ]

7026.659 --> 7032.659
oh okay well yeah well you're not

7029.42 --> 7035.659
dealing with that anymore bye Beth bye

7032.659 --> 7035.659
ass

7046.4 --> 7051.04
different opinion is healthy no it's not

7051.34 --> 7057.1990000000005
opinions are useless

7054.5 --> 7059.96
if you can't actually back them up if

7057.199 --> 7063.619
you can't reason it out an opinion it's

7059.96 --> 7066.26
just an average like ooh balancing out

7063.619 --> 7068.48
whatever the information is you have

7066.26 --> 7072.860000000001
and then usually your feelings have a

7068.48 --> 7076.839999999999
big say in that it's completely useless

7072.86 --> 7076.839999999999
if you're gonna lay down something

7076.88 --> 7081.76
and you have to ignore a bunch of data

7079.34 --> 7084.679
and information for that

7081.76 --> 7086.84
then it's useless it's just annoying

7084.679 --> 7090.08
you're just being solipsistic

7086.84 --> 7093.26
nobody gives a [ __ ] about people that

7090.08 --> 7096.44
can't handle things and become so

7093.26 --> 7098.0
obsidic in response we don't care I

7096.44 --> 7100.339999999999
don't care I don't even care if you guys

7098.0 --> 7101.54
in chat care I don't care and that's

7100.34 --> 7105.099
important

7101.54 --> 7105.099
because this is my freaking show

7110.199 --> 7114.678999999999
if you can't handle the truth then just

7112.94 --> 7117.739
shut up

7114.679 --> 7120.56
sit back and deal with it

7117.739 --> 7123.5
and then move on without need to hear

7120.56 --> 7125.0
about how you cannot

7123.5 --> 7128.02
accept

7125.0 --> 7128.02
certain things

7128.84 --> 7133.28
about what happened in the past

7131.36 --> 7137.08
and about what is

7133.28 --> 7137.08
in existence and what isn't

7138.56 --> 7143.360000000001
do I support Chinese no I don't steamy

7141.199 --> 7147.879999999999
Traveler

7143.36 --> 7147.88
no I don't absolutely not

7153.139 --> 7158.32
yeah Jose dude

7155.48 --> 7158.32
[ __ ] off

7160.52 --> 7164.26
you get it [ __ ] off

7167.9 --> 7172.239
next time I'm actually Banning you

7190.4 --> 7195.92
yeah I haven't presented evidence yeah I

7193.159 --> 7196.82
did you can't make the pyramids right

7195.92 --> 7199.099
now

7196.82 --> 7201.92
with all the money and all the people in

7199.099 --> 7204.5
the world you can't build that you can't

7201.92 --> 7208.219
build that it can only be built if you

7204.5 --> 7210.199
have really big giants you can't do it

7208.219 --> 7214.94
you can't do it

7210.199 --> 7218.0
yet it exists it's right there

7214.94 --> 7220.159
yeah that's not evidence to you well the

7218.0 --> 7221.96
evidence is freaking pyramids exist how

7220.159 --> 7223.04
about that that's the evidence they

7221.96 --> 7226.219
exist

7223.04 --> 7228.86
they can't be built right now

7226.219 --> 7231.26
yeah why because we don't have those

7228.86 --> 7235.04
giants we don't have really big freaking

7231.26 --> 7237.679
Giants to carry a hundred ton ballers

7235.04 --> 7240.619
yeah because we can't make equipment

7237.679 --> 7241.78
that can do that right now not talking

7240.619 --> 7245.659
about

7241.78 --> 7249.5
smart techniques how to use ropes and

7245.659 --> 7251.839999999999
and trees whatever that are barely even

7249.5 --> 7254.32
there yeah not even talking about and

7251.84 --> 7257.719
talk about modern [ __ ] equipment

7254.32 --> 7261.139
modern equipment from right now and we

7257.719 --> 7262.76
can't build that you get it it's right

7261.139 --> 7263.96
there though

7262.76 --> 7267.1990000000005
so

7263.96 --> 7270.139
unless you can figure out a logical

7267.199 --> 7272.299999999999
reasonable setup in which you can build

7270.139 --> 7275.96
those freaking pyramids without Giants

7272.3 --> 7279.320000000001
carrying a hundred ton pieces of rock

7275.96 --> 7281.719
then be my guest be my guest and lay it

7279.32 --> 7284.78
out now you could do that without Giants

7281.719 --> 7287.44
yeah I can think of a single way

7284.78 --> 7287.44
good luck

7302.3 --> 7308.0
over 100 yeah it's I don't know how

7304.88 --> 7309.8
heavy it is it's way too much I one

7308.0 --> 7311.719
thing I know about the numerical value

7309.8 --> 7314.2390000000005
of the weight of those rocks is that

7311.719 --> 7315.56
there is no piece of equipment in this

7314.239 --> 7318.199
Modern Age

7315.56 --> 7320.360000000001
or that could even be designed with

7318.199 --> 7322.28
everything we have available in this

7320.36 --> 7325.699
Modern Age that could freaking carry it

7322.28 --> 7327.38
right even if you specifically said a

7325.699 --> 7329.598999999999
whole bunch of money and people on

7327.38 --> 7333.56
trying to design a device that could do

7329.599 --> 7335.0
it you couldn't still do it you get it

7333.56 --> 7337.9400000000005
I mean

7335.0 --> 7340.699
how much more evidence do you need

7337.94 --> 7342.799999999999
they're right there

7340.699 --> 7345.138999999999
it's right there the pyramids are right

7342.8 --> 7347.7390000000005
there we can't build that

7345.139 --> 7347.7390000000005
yeah

7348.02 --> 7354.38
because we don't have the necessary

7350.36 --> 7356.5599999999995
Giants to carry the 100 ton blocks of

7354.38 --> 7356.56
Rock

7361.52 --> 7366.1990000000005
modern equipment can

7363.56 --> 7369.280000000001
lift 220

7366.199 --> 7369.28
000 metric tons

7370.58 --> 7379.96
really and can can it carry that

7374.06 --> 7379.96
like what is it over 30 kilometers

7381.86 --> 7386.5
over sand or water can it

7393.199 --> 7396.94
the world's strongest crane

7399.44 --> 7402.759999999999
they're not showing a picture

7413.0 --> 7417.46
lift a maximum of 80 meters

7421.52 --> 7427.6990000000005
yeah this is a

7424.159 --> 7430.46
this is a stationary thing

7427.699 --> 7433.659
this crane might be able to have insane

7430.46 --> 7438.56
lifting power it's not gonna like travel

7433.659 --> 7442.719
30 kilometers with that thing

7438.56 --> 7442.719
that's nice try though steamy Trevor

7446.239 --> 7450.159
levitate with yeah no

7450.92 --> 7454.88
yeah levitate with sound is really cool

7453.199 --> 7456.619
right it might have helped who knows

7454.88 --> 7458.599
maybe the Giants were able to actually

7456.619 --> 7461.839999999999
make it a little lighter with their

7458.599 --> 7464.56
sonic capabilities their sound magic to

7461.84 --> 7464.56
do that sure

7464.9 --> 7470.78
but yeah just making it lighter with

7467.84 --> 7472.04
sound doesn't actually negate all the

7470.78 --> 7475.239
weight

7472.04 --> 7475.239
for for a long time

7481.159 --> 7486.46
how many Giants would it take to carry

7483.38 --> 7486.46
100 ton I don't know

7487.4 --> 7492.0199999999995
a dozen

7489.56 --> 7497.1990000000005
you've got to realize that 20 meter tall

7492.02 --> 7497.1990000000005
Giants are that's pretty incredible

7502.159 --> 7505.78
I don't know how strong they were

7509.96 --> 7516.94
oh [ __ ] off Jose get the [ __ ] out here I

7513.139 --> 7516.9400000000005
don't want you here anymore you wanker

7526.639 --> 7532.119
several ways to build a park get the

7529.28 --> 7532.119
[ __ ] out of here

7534.86 --> 7540.32
no you can you can't build the [ __ ]

7537.739 --> 7543.619
pyramids Jose you ass

7540.32 --> 7545.179
you can't do that I can't do that all

7543.619 --> 7547.759999999999
the people in the world can't do that

7545.179 --> 7550.46
that's right we can't do that

7547.76 --> 7552.38
you can say that you can that just makes

7550.46 --> 7555.38
you another liar

7552.38 --> 7555.38
liar

7569.179 --> 7575.42
and and another giant allergist yeah got

7572.42 --> 7578.7390000000005
another we got another Grappler here

7575.42 --> 7578.7390000000005
got another Grappler

7582.079 --> 7585.88
heaviest load ever moved

7591.139 --> 7595.659000000001
okay

7593.179 --> 7598.28
right well steamy Trevor I don't know

7595.659 --> 7602.42
exactly how heavy

7598.28 --> 7604.759999999999
like the key Center Stone of the pyramid

7602.42 --> 7608.06
is I don't know I don't dude it could be

7604.76 --> 7610.34
a [ __ ] hundred thousand tons I don't

7608.06 --> 7612.9800000000005
know the numerical value I just know

7610.34 --> 7616.28
it's [ __ ] insane

7612.98 --> 7619.579
it's so freaking insane

7616.28 --> 7622.34
that it's just I I can't even properly

7619.579 --> 7625.579
size up how freaking heavy

7622.34 --> 7628.34
that is I just don't know anymore I just

7625.579 --> 7631.54
know it's way too heavy for anything

7628.34 --> 7631.54
that we can build

7637.219 --> 7641.86
if you ever visited the pyramids no I've

7638.9 --> 7641.86
never been to Egypt

7665.78 --> 7668.32
hmm

7676.52 --> 7679.52
interesting

7696.44 --> 7700.36
right yeah heavy [ __ ]

7700.48 --> 7706.04
[ __ ] you you're out of here I would say

7703.46 --> 7708.02
not welcome anymore you're an ass I

7706.04 --> 7708.8
don't want you here anymore get the [ __ ]

7708.02 --> 7711.7390000000005
out

7708.8 --> 7713.599
yeah you freaking rip my videos for the

7711.739 --> 7717.459999999999
[ __ ] fun of it well I don't think

7713.599 --> 7717.46
they're fun and I don't like your input

7718.46 --> 7721.06
get out

7738.86 --> 7742.07
[Applause]

7744.75 --> 7752.279
[Applause]

7766.639 --> 7771.26
all right yeah yeah I was actually kind

7769.4 --> 7776.119
of close

7771.26 --> 7779.780000000001
biggest Stone in the pyramid Giza is

7776.119 --> 7782.32
between 25 and 80 tons each there are

7779.78 --> 7782.32
several of them

7785.199 --> 7789.138999999999
500

7786.739 --> 7791.86
000 tons of mortar was used in because

7789.139 --> 7791.86
really

7793.099 --> 7799.06
I don't know about that part but yeah I

7795.86 --> 7799.0599999999995
was very close actually

7805.28 --> 7808.78
you're talking about one big pun

7818.9 --> 7825.799999999999
give me bright inside okay well I have

7823.04 --> 7828.679
seen the pyramid code which was a very

7825.8 --> 7830.96
good documentary I thought

7828.679 --> 7835.579
mini series documentary

7830.96 --> 7839.2390000000005
like in the early 21st century

7835.579 --> 7840.86
I've used that as a really big source of

7839.239 --> 7844.459999999999
inspiration

7840.86 --> 7847.28
even for my giant Theory

7844.46 --> 7849.699
and it does show a lot of really great

7847.28 --> 7849.699
footage

7879.56 --> 7884.54
yeah getting wisdom I know that's what I

7881.719 --> 7886.88
said before but not today but like way

7884.54 --> 7890.239
back on my show

7886.88 --> 7892.52
that yeah they would have never built so

7890.239 --> 7895.4
many freaking pyramids everywhere if it

7892.52 --> 7899.2390000000005
wasn't really easy and quick

7895.4 --> 7901.159
because that's insane

7899.239 --> 7904.459999999999
why would you like

7901.159 --> 7906.0199999999995
waste several Generations

7904.46 --> 7910.119
of people

7906.02 --> 7910.119000000001
just to build that [ __ ] everywhere

7910.82 --> 7917.42
and like without it going wrong like

7914.96 --> 7919.579
it's just insane they would have been

7917.42 --> 7922.84
able to build it very quickly or it

7919.579 --> 7922.84
wouldn't be intangible

7923.119 --> 7927.199
it would be no logical reason to keep

7925.219 --> 7929.44
building them if it was that hard every

7927.199 --> 7929.44
time

7955.28 --> 7960.0199999999995
bigger blocks yeah Matthew yeah could be

7958.099 --> 7962.4400000000005
I don't know what's in the exact base

7960.02 --> 7962.4400000000005
right

7967.46 --> 7972.38
maybe yeah so maybe you're right maybe

7969.44 --> 7974.659
even bigger blocks below there it's just

7972.38 --> 7976.34
that these specific blocks that the

7974.659 --> 7978.138999999999
king's chamber are

7976.34 --> 7980.0
well they they're like you can actually

7978.139 --> 7981.26
see them and try to size them up and

7980.0 --> 7984.34
that's how they

7981.26 --> 7984.34
get to that number

7985.099 --> 7991.78
but there might be bigger Parts even

7987.44 --> 7991.78
underneath all that and Out Of Reach

8017.92 --> 8020.4
right

8022.239 --> 8024.48
foreign

8031.8 --> 8035.28
good luck with that

8040.179 --> 8045.9400000000005
right just because you can actually lift

8042.82 --> 8048.639
these insane heavy weights and transport

8045.94 --> 8052.32
them very slowly perhaps

8048.639 --> 8052.32
maybe that's possible by now

8052.48 --> 8057.339999999999
right that doesn't mean that you could

8054.76 --> 8059.860000000001
just oh let's just assemble that all

8057.34 --> 8061.96
right let's assemble it exactly like the

8059.86 --> 8063.82
pyramid oh really how how does that even

8061.96 --> 8066.82
work

8063.82 --> 8068.619
I mean the thing the internals kind of

8066.82 --> 8071.4
look like they were basically assembled

8068.619 --> 8071.4
like a puzzle

8073.119 --> 8076.619
like yeah

8082.78 --> 8087.04
oh you don't think so Richie well it's

8085.06 --> 8089.9400000000005
none of your damn business if I block

8087.04 --> 8089.94
Jose or not

8094.84 --> 8098.56
and I'm not blocking it because he

8096.82 --> 8100.48
doesn't believe Giants are blocking him

8098.56 --> 8104.280000000001
because he

8100.48 --> 8104.28
keeps spouting it out

8105.579 --> 8111.04
keeps trying to push against

8108.82 --> 8112.239
what I'm trying to say here

8111.04 --> 8115.48
yeah

8112.239 --> 8117.4
I I do block people for that

8115.48 --> 8118.36
if you don't like that then don't come

8117.4 --> 8121.0199999999995
here

8118.36 --> 8121.0199999999995
because I do

8136.179 --> 8140.56
why aren't we using these grains to

8138.639 --> 8143.9400000000005
build things comparable because it's

8140.56 --> 8143.9400000000005
probably not worth it rick back

8146.199 --> 8151.0
because the world is too unstable

8148.659 --> 8153.219
volatile and demon possessed that it

8151.0 --> 8155.88
would make giant projects like that just

8153.219 --> 8155.88
not worth it

8156.579 --> 8161.579
it would probably be end up getting

8158.739 --> 8161.579
sabotaged

8200.08 --> 8207.219
you can't just jump to therefore Giants

8204.219 --> 8209.399
carrying big rocks equals pyramids why

8207.219 --> 8209.399
not

8215.679 --> 8219.179
I mean seriously why not

8271.66 --> 8275.16
pick stadiums

8275.559 --> 8279.96
yeah hope to do

8289.179 --> 8295.26
what

8291.219 --> 8295.259999999998
no I have not heard about that

8298.2 --> 8302.099
periodics yeah what the hell

8302.2 --> 8305.7
never heard of that before ever

8315.58 --> 8319.559
it doesn't recognize the word

8332.26 --> 8335.460000000001
I think it's a troll

8339.399 --> 8344.26
I think that literally a troll making

8341.2 --> 8345.639000000001
[ __ ] up let me let me remove you

8344.26 --> 8348.28
yeah

8345.639 --> 8349.539999999999
missed information planting piece of

8348.28 --> 8352.599
[ __ ]

8349.54 --> 8355.139000000001
let me remove both of you

8352.599 --> 8355.139000000001
scum

8402.1 --> 8406.54
right I think I'm gonna round out the

8404.62 --> 8411.18
show

8406.54 --> 8411.18
in two hours and 20 minutes almost

8419.439 --> 8424.479000000001
right

8420.66 --> 8427.66
so yeah still people out there

8424.479 --> 8430.539999999999
they cannot accept Giants exist it's

8427.66 --> 8433.119999999999
like giants to some people is like what

8430.54 --> 8434.02
flatter it is to the globe for some

8433.12 --> 8436.720000000001
people

8434.02 --> 8438.7
I've experienced this

8436.72 --> 8441.16
throughout my life

8438.7 --> 8443.68
it's a very little kid

8441.16 --> 8444.939
I was all into Giants and there were

8443.68 --> 8446.319
literally people out there if I

8444.939 --> 8450.64
confronted them there that they would

8446.319 --> 8453.039999999999
get like like personally offended

8450.64 --> 8455.8
that I believed in that they would be

8453.04 --> 8457.78
personally offended and not because they

8455.8 --> 8460.539999999999
were like Christian and thought it was

8457.78 --> 8463.54
like this bad joints are bad no not like

8460.54 --> 8465.160000000002
now they were like you are insane for

8463.54 --> 8467.62
believing that

8465.16 --> 8471.28
and they would start bullying me yeah

8467.62 --> 8475.02
because there is like a weird

8471.28 --> 8480.34
giant thing a weird giant allergy people

8475.02 --> 8482.68
that cannot accept that giants existed

8480.34 --> 8484.899
they treat it just like as if it were

8482.68 --> 8487.66
flat earth like no it can't be flat it

8484.899 --> 8489.939
has to be a ball yeah it's like no Can't

8487.66 --> 8492.88
Be Giants it's impossible

8489.939 --> 8495.1
for no logical particular reason other

8492.88 --> 8497.858999999999
than that they just can't accept it they

8495.1 --> 8501.460000000001
can't fit it in anywhere

8497.859 --> 8502.84
is that because of the Smithsonian I

8501.46 --> 8506.319
don't know

8502.84 --> 8508.54
I just know some people have this crazy

8506.319 --> 8510.399
anti-giant

8508.54 --> 8513.76
conviction

8510.399 --> 8515.56
it cannot accept that they existed

8513.76 --> 8518.74
I don't know why

8515.56 --> 8520.18
but I do know I hate those [ __ ]

8518.74 --> 8523.359
people

8520.18 --> 8526.359
I've never met a person that had giant

8523.359 --> 8528.66
