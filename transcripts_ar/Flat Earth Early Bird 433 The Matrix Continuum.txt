239.46 --> 245.25
yesterday's hangout was quite a blast

241.83 --> 247.67000000000002
I watched it back it was great I thought

245.25 --> 247.67
it was great

252.9 --> 256.889
oh yeah that's typically when I started

255.72 --> 258.84
these hangouts I always have trouble

256.889 --> 261.81
just remembering what things were even

258.84 --> 268.59
about eventually I'll get into it back

261.81 --> 272.31
into it again debates was quite long

268.59 --> 276.75
after show I think I don't know I think

272.31 --> 285.0
Randy did bootleg some of it I went away

276.75 --> 290.83
after certain points did Randy play

285.0 --> 294.699
another bootleg right

290.83 --> 297.599
it was the second part of the ever after

294.699 --> 297.599
show from last time

303.319 --> 309.72
yeah that was interesting and very

306.3 --> 314.88
typical it yeah just Brenda just just a

309.72 --> 318.63000000000005
lot of random oh yeah red pill

314.88 --> 325.65
philosophy went up to MC tombs over addy

318.63 --> 328.949
life I watched that and to be fair you

325.65 --> 330.81
know like MC Tunes is like one of the

328.949 --> 333.33000000000004
more really polite guys

330.81 --> 336.27
among the ballers he is a religious

333.33 --> 337.85999999999996
baller though it doesn't think he is but

336.27 --> 344.13
yeah a real baller never thinks they're

337.86 --> 346.02000000000004
religious but yeah red pill can get

344.13 --> 349.77
really harsh man he was like really

346.02 --> 352.53
harsh on MC tunes even yeah more than he

349.77 --> 354.0
actually deserves in my opinion so it

352.53 --> 357.56899999999996
seemed like red pill was a bit

354.0 --> 359.61
over-enthusiastic but yeah still the

357.569 --> 362.55
points that he made were very much on

359.61 --> 367.53000000000003
target of course red pill knows what's

362.55 --> 369.84000000000003
going down but he was just in my

367.53 --> 373.61999999999995
personal opinion the biddin a bit too

369.84 --> 375.78
harsh on MC tune so it was still good it

373.62 --> 378.09000000000003
was still good a typical and lots of

375.78 --> 383.94
viewers man he had like over 200 viewers

378.09 --> 389.38899999999995
on on t life so yeah red pill he

383.94 --> 389.389
definitely draws a crowd every time

389.58 --> 395.18
oh the chant is stuck again thanks candy

392.52 --> 395.18
for pointing that out

403.36 --> 415.84000000000003
right yeah a tiny one ball yeah lot of

413.979 --> 420.28
damn votes it's because of the trolls

415.84 --> 423.4
they didn't like they didn't especially

420.28 --> 429.52
man there was this one really freaking

423.4 --> 435.4
funny comment it was so funny it was on

429.52 --> 437.409
a Mick West video from 2018 of red

435.4 --> 444.28
Nathan Oakley's and suddenly this

437.409 --> 446.59
comment popped up in my feed this is

444.28 --> 451.10999999999996
with let me see if I can actually

446.59 --> 454.659
physically show that it is so odd

451.11 --> 458.08000000000004
because it's not my video and it wasn't

454.659 --> 461.639
a reply to my comment yet I got it in

458.08 --> 464.68
the feet as if it were a reply on

461.639 --> 470.74
somebody else's video from two years and

464.68 --> 473.319
it's so odd I can't explain why why that

470.74 --> 477.40000000000003
happened just look

473.319 --> 481.599
yes sorry it for the loop now but here

477.4 --> 487.85999999999996
this Paul replied see replied replied or

481.599 --> 487.86
it's Paul commented but this

488.66 --> 499.19
this is not my video so why did you two

493.94 --> 501.62
even show that see highlight at the

499.19 --> 508.1
comment now I did respond after that but

501.62 --> 510.7
this video is from June 3rd 2018 it's

508.1 --> 516.11
over 1/2 years old

510.7 --> 518.96
it's weird anyway yeah he said something

516.11 --> 523.02
so funny just I laughed all the way and

518.96 --> 525.7
I'll show it to you guys

523.02 --> 530.56
[Music]

525.7 --> 530.5600000000001
he was really really triggered

532.43 --> 538.8389999999999
it was special so I read read that for a

536.45 --> 538.839
second

555.82 --> 563.6500000000001
but anyway I think that big yeah because

560.53 --> 567.31
I responded to some of this it probably

563.65 --> 569.74
drew drew drew some attention from other

567.31 --> 574.8699999999999
trolls so they thought yeah let's pile

569.74 --> 578.23
onto the early bird show today because

574.87 --> 582.3100000000001
we're not yeah because I'm laughing at

578.23 --> 587.14
this basic globe virtue signaling

582.31 --> 590.5
complainy pants person that's just

587.14 --> 592.86
really triggered and add humming us all

590.5 --> 595.81
the way how are telling us how is stupid

592.86 --> 598.1800000000001
you know what maybe I'll just read it

595.81 --> 601.15
out this is normally not really down my

598.18 --> 604.2099999999999
lane but I'll just do it anyway what

601.15 --> 606.6999999999999
utter nonsense got such schoolyard

604.21 --> 610.09
antics it's painful listening what a

606.7 --> 610.6600000000001
pair of arrogant and educated pedantic

610.09 --> 613.09
fools

610.66 --> 615.49
trying to sound intelligent doesn't

613.09 --> 619.75
quite cut it when you come up against

615.49 --> 623.17
somebody who genuinely is hence the rude

619.75 --> 625.84
bullying pact tactics and desperation in

623.17 --> 629.5899999999999
your behavior I expect to see this sort

625.84 --> 631.5
of thing on the likes of reinforce so

629.59 --> 633.97
I'm genuinely shocked this

631.5 --> 637.96
religiously-based lunacy is being

633.97 --> 642.01
defended in the UK home I got so sorry

637.96 --> 644.89
for you so sorry not everybody falls in

642.01 --> 648.34
line with with Maine slavery

644.89 --> 650.9499999999999
indoctrination I'm sorry my faith faith

648.34 --> 654.52
in the British education has been lost

650.95 --> 656.6500000000001
what is slightly comforting is that this

654.52 --> 660.73
hogwash has received such a feeble

656.65 --> 663.85
number of views and supports or make has

660.73 --> 667.54
the patient of a saint and conducts

663.85 --> 672.7900000000001
himself professionally I highly doubt

667.54 --> 676.36
you pubescent pugnacious petulant pricks

672.79 --> 678.61
I take it are so full of yourself when

676.36 --> 681.13
speaking with people on this topic face

678.61 --> 684.19
to face when you are unable to get away

681.13 --> 686.11
with such infantile behavior constantly

684.19 --> 689.0200000000001
speaking over make is your idea of

686.11 --> 689.87
winning an argument it's pathetic you're

689.02 --> 692.9
flattered

689.87 --> 694.97
there's you haired guys we're flattered

692.9 --> 699.76
ah--this it's like it's the ultimate

694.97 --> 702.65
argument need we say more

699.76 --> 705.77
you believe there is a global conspiracy

702.65 --> 707.9
spanning centuries involving every

705.77 --> 711.53
single scientists who have ever lived

707.9 --> 713.51
really oh yeah the ones that didn't

711.53 --> 715.79
agreed were kind of like exercise

713.51 --> 717.91
wouldn't weren't at their ideas word and

715.79 --> 721.4
add it there they were ridiculed so yeah

717.91 --> 724.04
every pilots Noel not every pilot though

721.4 --> 726.14
but yeah again they don't like losing

724.04 --> 728.3
their jobs it's a well-paying job they

726.14 --> 729.59
make a lot of effort for and they don't

728.3 --> 732.17
like to lose it so they don't get

729.59 --> 734.9300000000001
involved in this kind of bickering it's

732.17 --> 738.56
very wise of them overall and countless

734.93 --> 742.51
other communities that rely on the earth

738.56 --> 753.53
being big hope this for their

742.51 --> 757.1
calculations to work that communities

753.53 --> 760.31
that rely on the earth being a globe for

757.1 --> 764.57
though their calculations to work the

760.31 --> 769.8399999999999
head into tricking us into believing

764.57 --> 773.09
that's to enthuse the earth is round and

769.84 --> 776.6600000000001
for what benefit what exactly is the

773.09 --> 778.13
purpose of this deception how many times

776.66 --> 779.9599999999999
we have to share this with you it's

778.13 --> 784.49
blatantly obvious if you control the

779.96 --> 787.64
information you control where people can

784.49 --> 790.52
go and they won't see it and there can

787.64 --> 794.18
be made a lot of money of it but even

790.52 --> 796.22
besides money it's just power power to

794.18 --> 797.1999999999999
stare people outside of their own

796.22 --> 800.15
insights

797.2 --> 805.36
so yeah blatantly obvious to take us

800.15 --> 808.13
away from Jesus is that it well yeah

805.36 --> 811.07
esoterically yes it is to take us away

808.13 --> 814.97
from the truth from insight from

811.07 --> 817.73
critical thoughts which will result in

814.97 --> 821.39
other people gaining the ability to take

817.73 --> 822.72
control of you instead so yeah in a way

821.39 --> 826.319
it is to take us away

822.72 --> 828.75
from Jesus every other celestial body is

826.319 --> 834.2299999999999
round but not earth that's hilarious

828.75 --> 837.93
straw man you dig you dig has higher

834.23 --> 840.4490000000001
mental functions then you pair put

837.93 --> 842.6099999999999
together hmm

840.449 --> 844.62
well when you're talking about mental

842.61 --> 847.5
high functions and all that maybe you

844.62 --> 849.36
should properly spell your sentence so

847.5 --> 853.769
we can actually understand what you're

849.36 --> 855.8100000000001
saying doesn't say seem very functional

853.769 --> 861.779
in a higher mental way if you know what

855.81 --> 871.2589999999999
I mean you epitomize the proverbial just

861.779 --> 875.009
playing pigeon okay what is a proverbial

871.259 --> 878.16
chess playing pigeon okay that's I think

875.009 --> 880.1990000000001
that's a it's an anecdotal reference to

878.16 --> 884.129
something I don't really care I don't

880.199 --> 886.829
know sounded halfway intelligent I take

884.129 --> 888.3000000000001
it you're creationists - oh my god

886.829 --> 891.87
because there's so much proof of

888.3 --> 897.75
evolutions justice shame those dinosaurs

891.87 --> 900.089
and you know and puddles of ooze and big

897.75 --> 901.98
bangs it's why would we be create

900.089 --> 904.379
creationists you know when you have all

901.98 --> 906.99
these ridiculous and provable stories

904.379 --> 910.98
that hold no weight when you actually

906.99 --> 913.5
test them empirically anyway I also take

910.98 --> 916.889
it my comment will be deleted as

913.5 --> 921.959
religion does love a bit of censorship

916.889 --> 924.24
well no in the contrary we actually like

921.959 --> 926.79
to leave these types of comments and

924.24 --> 929.819
then make a lot of fun of them because

926.79 --> 932.279
it is freaking hilarious it is like it's

929.819 --> 935.459
a piece of unintended comedy it's a it's

932.279 --> 937.879
a gift of creation this is so freaking

935.459 --> 941.2199999999999
funny why would anybody delete this okay

937.879 --> 945.0
how else can it push the propaganda and

941.22 --> 950.0690000000001
promote its deceitful agenda oh right

945.0 --> 953.49
sure good good look in the real world

950.069 --> 955.41
guys enjoy your life of ridicule it's

953.49 --> 960.059
thoroughly deserved

955.41 --> 962.669
well thanks for that common and yeah a

960.059 --> 965.189
big rolling on the floor laughing my ass

962.669 --> 967.5889999999999
off when I read that definitely so

965.189 --> 970.3489999999999
anyway yeah wanted to share that part

967.589 --> 973.3090000000001
with you guys for a moment I thought it

970.349 --> 973.3090000000001
was quite hilarious

976.39 --> 979.5699999999999
[Music]

999.45 --> 1002.519
[Music]

1007.02 --> 1012.3199999999999
so any any reactions

1025.37 --> 1032.1
you're not banned seeking truth

1028.429 --> 1038.7900000000002
otherwise we wouldn't be reading that in

1032.1 --> 1043.02
the jet ya loose lips I think that is

1038.79 --> 1046.049
ridiculous I think that's a very victim

1043.02 --> 1051.0
mentality approach earth as a prison

1046.049 --> 1055.23
planet souls misbehaving well I'd rather

1051.0 --> 1058.32
see it as a test the misbehavior the

1055.23 --> 1061.23
earthly instincts are the challenge for

1058.32 --> 1063.51
our spirits to overcome and it is a

1061.23 --> 1065.3700000000001
challenge and it was designed to always

1063.51 --> 1068.309
be a challenge and if you think you can

1065.37 --> 1069.9599999999998
outsmart the challenge then the

1068.309 --> 1072.1499999999999
challenge will eventually end up

1069.96 --> 1075.39
outsmarting you that's how it really

1072.15 --> 1077.7
works so I think that the earth is a

1075.39 --> 1082.3500000000001
prison planet that we're sent to as a

1077.7 --> 1085.23
prison is a fundamental essential

1082.35 --> 1088.6789999999999
spiritual mistake because that is

1085.23 --> 1090.72
typically what what our Rieman was tell

1088.679 --> 1092.669
us that soul punishment that there's

1090.72 --> 1097.919
only the part that the punishment is the

1092.669 --> 1101.15
emphasis it's not so yeah that's my

1097.919 --> 1101.15
response to that loose lips

1104.049 --> 1109.639
yeah some think we getting reincarnated

1107.419 --> 1114.019
until we find grace in a way I think

1109.639 --> 1120.2199999999998
that's that's probably right but how the

1114.019 --> 1123.97
nature of that works yeah yeah that is

1120.22 --> 1123.97
there is kind of mysterious

1134.38 --> 1139.659
yeah crankiest fuzzy tme I did listen to

1137.679 --> 1142.269
Randy grantees hang out with Brenda and

1139.659 --> 1148.0590000000002
it was absolutely ridiculous as Brenda

1142.269 --> 1151.21
is it's it I I think I missed a severely

1148.059 --> 1153.009
triggered but she was Randy said she was

1151.21 --> 1154.559
gonna be extremely triggered I think I

1153.009 --> 1158.88
missed that part

1154.559 --> 1158.8799999999999
got distracted by something else

1182.51 --> 1188.96
Oh God now - Fantine it's all just

1186.08 --> 1191.8999999999999
gloating about being predators Oh God

1188.96 --> 1194.3600000000001
yeah the word predator so because oh

1191.9 --> 1197.15
that's that you're going to interpret

1194.36 --> 1199.76
that's very specifically aren't you is

1197.15 --> 1200.75
your social justice where your condition

1199.76 --> 1205.57
may be right

1200.75 --> 1208.91
well we were talking just about the

1205.57 --> 1216.26
interactions so it's metaphorical if you

1208.91 --> 1219.6100000000001
didn't get that then yeah then you're

1216.26 --> 1219.61
probably trolling me here

1233.49 --> 1238.47
annoying drop it or I don't want you

1237.69 --> 1240.6000000000001
here anymore

1238.47 --> 1242.64
I'm serious like you've been around you

1240.6 --> 1246.12
say some smart things but you now have

1242.64 --> 1249.48
this just this little arrogant wall

1246.12 --> 1251.82
attitude towards me now like you're

1249.48 --> 1255.57
entitled to certain things and it really

1251.82 --> 1262.34
pisses me off so if you don't drop it

1255.57 --> 1262.34
you're banned okay Ivan clean Veen

1262.94 --> 1267.0800000000002
you're gonna have to make a choice here

copyright of what what did you get

[Music]

1346.21 --> 1349.39

1362.25 --> 1367.17
old-school film you played what oh what

1366.6 --> 1370.74
Oh what

1367.17 --> 1373.29
old-school film because I'm pretty sure

1370.74 --> 1377.54
that the old films are not copyrighted

1373.29 --> 1377.54
anymore it's last for like 50 years

1377.96 --> 1381.17
that's weird

1390.63 --> 1393.739
[Music]

1394.41 --> 1401.01
hmm all right tough luck man you gotta

1398.4 --> 1402.5700000000002
be careful with that stuff I just don't

1401.01 --> 1404.4
do it anymore

1402.57 --> 1407.46
like the last time I even did that I was

1404.4 --> 1410.3400000000001
kind of aware of it I just played it one

1407.46 --> 1413.8500000000001
minute not even a minute Lord of the

1410.34 --> 1415.7099999999998
Rings and they just yeah immediately

1413.85 --> 1418.02
well they didn't copyright strike me

1415.71 --> 1425.22
they just took the advertisement for

1418.02 --> 1427.53
themselves it's just there's yeah

1425.22 --> 1429.81
there's a lot of harvest to copyright

1427.53 --> 1432.75
harvesting stuff going on right there

1429.81 --> 1435.1799999999998
but it's weird that I say that that you

1432.75 --> 1438.11
would get literal copy strike copyright

1435.18 --> 1438.1100000000001
strike for that

1448.27 --> 1451.74
that's yeah that's odd

1454.17 --> 1457.299
[Music]

1459.74 --> 1462.94
[Music]

1499.38 --> 1510.5700000000002
our movie apps to download free copy

1505.38 --> 1516.63
free movies huh or you just got to be

1510.57 --> 1519.51
very careful with your pic and yeah it's

1516.63 --> 1524.25
usually the sound so if you want to show

1519.51 --> 1527.01
some video and you can still make the

1524.25 --> 1530.25
point or like do the narrating instead

1527.01 --> 1532.32
of having the sound there then usually

1530.25 --> 1535.77
you can avoid getting copyright strike

1532.32 --> 1538.25
because it really becomes detectable by

1535.77 --> 1538.25
the sound

1549.45 --> 1557.95
yeah that it was weird was it was it

1555.039 --> 1560.83
yesterday or two days ago a secret Asian

1557.95 --> 1563.769
man also I was literally watching as

1560.83 --> 1568.149
suddenly his channel on D life was shut

1563.769 --> 1572.519
down for a copyright of yeah Eve was

1568.149 --> 1576.6689999999999
basically just playing entire movies

1572.519 --> 1579.76
that weren't exactly public so yeah it

1576.669 --> 1583.74
I'm amazed that it took so long he was

1579.76 --> 1586.48
like doing that for almost a month I

1583.74 --> 1589.51
quite enjoyed it I've seen some good

1586.48 --> 1590.34
films there that I that I've never seen

1589.51 --> 1593.4089999999999
before

1590.34 --> 1596.019
but yeah unfortunately he added that

1593.409 --> 1599.25
channels narrowed down no more secret

1596.019 --> 1599.25
Asian man over D life

1622.58 --> 1629.51
right yeah unicorn Slayer well if you

1627.05 --> 1633.5
play some music in the background that

1629.51 --> 1638.68
might work but there's no guarantee that

1633.5 --> 1641.78
it will work because the same sounds

1638.68 --> 1645.5
that the blueprint for the recognition

1641.78 --> 1648.23
system will still pick that sound up and

1645.5 --> 1649.79
if it's very close it even if it would

1648.23 --> 1651.6200000000001
the whole thing would be slightly

1649.79 --> 1654.83
distorted with really bad quality it

1651.62 --> 1658.31
would still pick it up so it sound is

1654.83 --> 1662.87
very difficult to mask for the detection

1658.31 --> 1665.6599999999999
system video not so much you know

1662.87 --> 1668.2399999999998
there's even basically in legal rips

1665.66 --> 1671.5600000000002
even in YouTube where they just take the

1668.24 --> 1674.24
movie put it in a box and then put it in

1671.56 --> 1677.1499999999999
the corner of the video and the rest all

1674.24 --> 1683.9
weird colors and [ __ ] and that also

1677.15 --> 1686.51
works I don't know how they managed to

1683.9 --> 1690.3200000000002
bypass it so long that they can still

1686.51 --> 1692.21
keep the sound in there but at least

1690.32 --> 1697.27
that seems to be something they do to

1692.21 --> 1697.27
bypass the the copyright detection

1701.68 --> 1706.46
but they eventually do get taken down

1704.51 --> 1709.25
but like these types of channels always

1706.46 --> 1711.65
pop up keep on popping up every now and

1709.25 --> 1714.29
then it's like Oh somebody's putting out

1711.65 --> 1717.47
this series on YouTube like for example

1714.29 --> 1718.34
what was it the gravity falls I've never

1717.47 --> 1721.22
seen that before

1718.34 --> 1723.6799999999998
it was also before I got access to

1721.22 --> 1727.46
Netflix and then suddenly somebody just

1723.68 --> 1730.4
started streaming live streaming the

1727.46 --> 1734.47
videos and then kept them there so you

1730.4 --> 1736.67
could literally see the whole series and

1734.47 --> 1743.56
then at some point certainly it got

1736.67 --> 1743.5600000000002
taken down anyway

1752.79 --> 1758.61
come on Anders days it's not funny the

1756.54 --> 1762.78
josé's channel getting a strike isn't

1758.61 --> 1766.6789999999999
exactly funny you know nobody really

1762.78 --> 1777.08
deserves to strike unless they just are

1766.679 --> 1777.0800000000002
they're just troll people that's right

1782.01 --> 1787.46
[Music]

1783.22 --> 1789.919
well the thing is with copyright is it's

1787.46 --> 1792.769
just a framework it's just a law

1789.919 --> 1794.929
framework and it all depends on how it

1792.769 --> 1797.929
is being applied because copyrights

1794.929 --> 1802.989
issues were there before you know it's

1797.929 --> 1807.47
just that yeah YouTube was just like nah

1802.989 --> 1809.3600000000001
you know what just let him go while so

1807.47 --> 1811.1290000000001
with their copyright they could still

1809.36 --> 1813.879
crack down they just wouldn't do it

1811.129 --> 1816.259
see it is kind of like how police can be

1813.879 --> 1818.629
super super strict about the rules stand

1816.259 --> 1820.279
on every street corner and just soon as

1818.629 --> 1823.279
somebody Jamie walks walk up to them and

1820.279 --> 1826.609
then find them that kind of [ __ ] or they

1823.279 --> 1828.769
could be like yeah I know there's all

1826.609 --> 1830.6899999999998
these rules but we're just here to keep

1828.769 --> 1834.32
order really and not to get in people's

1830.69 --> 1836.989
way and so it all depends on how the

1834.32 --> 1841.84
copyright system is going to be wielded

1836.989 --> 1841.8400000000001
by those that wield it see

1849.18 --> 1855.8200000000002
and yeah now YouTube is just attacking a

1853.33 --> 1860.98
lot their attacking their just overall

1855.82 --> 1863.6499999999999
attacking a lot of groups with

1860.98 --> 1866.35
copyrights they're yeah they're cracking

1863.65 --> 1870.16
down hard but and I think I also think

1866.35 --> 1872.4399999999998
there may be some not so blatantly

1870.16 --> 1875.53
obvious reasons even as to why they do

1872.44 --> 1879.22
it why they seemingly are attacking

1875.53 --> 1882.07
their own their own workers as it were

1879.22 --> 1884.56
in a way their own content makers well

1882.07 --> 1887.6799999999998
maybe they're doing it because they

1884.56 --> 1890.6499999999999
literally have too much content and they

1887.68 --> 1892.8100000000002
need to get rid of some of the stuff

1890.65 --> 1895.8400000000001
they have because there's just too

1892.81 --> 1899.46
it's costing too much it is widely known

1895.84 --> 1904.6899999999998
that YouTube is actually making a loss

1899.46 --> 1905.95
because it takes up too much bandwidth

1904.69 --> 1908.1100000000001
over all people

1905.95 --> 1910.8400000000001
too many people are watching too many

1908.11 --> 1913.4499999999998
things at the same time it sounds kind

1910.84 --> 1914.98
of weird and they have giant machines

1913.45 --> 1917.92
for it but they still cost a lot of

1914.98 --> 1920.55
electricity maintenance and then just

1917.92 --> 1920.5500000000002
yeah

1923.49 --> 1930.49
Anders days Jose is a youtuber he

1928.15 --> 1934.0300000000002
provides a platform also a good platform

1930.49 --> 1937.39
where we're flat earthers have had and

1934.03 --> 1942.3999999999999
still have the opportunity to go at it

1937.39 --> 1944.5900000000001
in a baller room okay and he doesn't

1942.4 --> 1947.6200000000001
jose doesn't censor the flat earthers

1944.59 --> 1950.26
he's not biased against them he has his

1947.62 --> 1953.83
opinions and when you attack him he wolf

1950.26 --> 1956.32
strike back but he he doesn't he's not

1953.83 --> 1960.37
as bad as some real series ballers that

1956.32 --> 1962.74
bet literally censor and just make sure

1960.37 --> 1964.6599999999999
that the flat earther look stupid I

1962.74 --> 1966.67
don't think that Jose does that so I

1964.66 --> 1970.69
don't know why you're being so harsh on

1966.67 --> 1973.44
him you know there's some there's worse

1970.69 --> 1973.44
people out there

1991.48 --> 1994.96
[Music]

2007.22 --> 2012.47
yeah I don't really like flip-flops as

2010.13 --> 2015.89
well and there's a swell yeah it is what

2012.47 --> 2019.16
it is you know I lo don't like septic

2015.89 --> 2021.8000000000002
behavior in people as well that is what

2019.16 --> 2027.8300000000002
it is just have to deal with it they're

2021.8 --> 2029.84
there they're not going away and they're

2027.83 --> 2033.1699999999998
not going to go away I might just as

2029.84 --> 2038.24
well try to see what I can make of it

2033.17 --> 2041.8100000000002
you know you don't have to be enemies

2038.24 --> 2050.93
with everyone that doesn't agree with

2041.81 --> 2052.97
you it's not a very efficient way to to

2050.93 --> 2060.3199999999997
go about socially if you know what it

2052.97 --> 2063.68
means and there's days oh really cranky

2060.32 --> 2065.7200000000003
is Fozzie TM well don't worry about it

2063.68 --> 2068.5299999999997
you know if you want to get on with me

2065.72 --> 2072.6099999999997
on the show that's take your time

2068.53 --> 2072.61
doesn't have to be now if you're nervous

2072.88 --> 2076.69
let's leave faster

2076.869 --> 2086.079
so it's okay besides there's just 15

2082.119 --> 2088.829
minutes left anyway but I'm glad you're

2086.079 --> 2088.829
thinking about it

2092.29 --> 2098.37
if you really want to come on with me

2094.72 --> 2102.6099999999997
sometime then make sure to let me know

2098.37 --> 2105.52
like at least in the first 15 minutes so

2102.61 --> 2108.2200000000003
then I can have proper time so some

2105.52 --> 2110.44
proper preparation also mentally and

2108.22 --> 2113.0699999999997
socially it's like yeah having a guest

2110.44 --> 2118.4700000000003
on this very different type of show

2113.07 --> 2118.4700000000003
so some advanced warning would be good

2140.79 --> 2144.579
[Music]

2147.77 --> 2156.25
can we have a one-to-one and record it

2151.04 --> 2161.2
uh I guess we could do that as well

2156.25 --> 2164.21
sure crankiest Fozzie TM I could do that

2161.2 --> 2166.0699999999997
could recorded with the OBS and then I

2164.21 --> 2170.18
guess played another night I'll show if

2166.07 --> 2171.6800000000003
if you would like that sure but I can't

2170.18 --> 2182.96
do that today though today's Wednesday

2171.68 --> 2185.24
and don't have the time and I have to

2182.96 --> 2186.38
get myself to actually cook some proper

2185.24 --> 2192.4599999999996
dinner tonight

2186.38 --> 2197.0
also I'm gonna be quite cramped

2192.46 --> 2198.859
concerning the time but maybe tomorrow I

2197.0 --> 2201.2
could do something like that it also

2198.859 --> 2205.7
depends like how long the after shows

2201.2 --> 2207.5299999999997
tend to last and it does last pretty

2205.7 --> 2212.77
long where are you by the way crank is

2207.53 --> 2212.77
Fozzie TM you are you in Australia or

2213.22 --> 2219.4399999999996
what is your timezone Oh Martinelli

2217.91 --> 2221.5699999999997
we I'm cooking something that I haven't

2219.44 --> 2223.96
cooked in a long long long time never a

2221.57 --> 2223.96
rice-based

2224.14 --> 2227.14
dinner

2230.04 --> 2239.72
it's Asian it's yeah it's kind of what I

2234.15 --> 2242.73
remember a sort of a adapted originally

2239.72 --> 2245.22
Indonesian meal sort of in that

2242.73 --> 2248.01
direction I don't know I like it it's

2245.22 --> 2255.66
mostly just tomato sauce with a lot of

2248.01 --> 2260.6000000000004
ginger in it and peas and egg and just

2255.66 --> 2264.27
rice with the typical ya nah see tight I

2260.6 --> 2265.7999999999997
used to make that a lot but I haven't

2264.27 --> 2269.22
made it in a long long time and I

2265.8 --> 2273.09
thought like I should really just try

2269.22 --> 2275.1899999999996
just even just to try rice again you

2273.09 --> 2279.96
know because I haven't I eaten rice in a

2275.19 --> 2283.38
long long time just mostly because I

2279.96 --> 2287.19
guess that I don't really like rice

2283.38 --> 2289.83
mewls typically when they're vegetarian

2287.19 --> 2292.109
completely for some reason it just

2289.83 --> 2294.75
doesn't work as well compared to a lot

2292.109 --> 2297.95
of other types of meals when I went

2294.75 --> 2302.99
vegetarian anyway I'm gonna have that I

2297.95 --> 2302.99
hope if I could get myself to make it

2303.74 --> 2308.45
otherwise it's just gonna be french

2305.7 --> 2311.75
fries again can't keep on doing that

2308.45 --> 2311.75
it's not healthy

2324.64 --> 2333.5499999999997
how far back can an object be loomed up

2327.64 --> 2335.74
from behind the horizon well that's a

2333.55 --> 2340.4500000000003
that's a good question it's a technical

2335.74 --> 2343.54
question Julie Oh Kevin how far back

2340.45 --> 2345.8199999999997
well technically as far back as vision

2343.54 --> 2348.2799999999997
allows because how what is reflected

2345.82 --> 2352.15
it's still lit it's basically a

2348.28 --> 2355.09
reflection of what is visible so it

2352.15 --> 2358.77
depends on the uniformity of the

2355.09 --> 2362.98
reflection layer and that coincides with

2358.77 --> 2365.68
general what is it refraction yeah

2362.98 --> 2367.39
refraction that blurs things up so the

2365.68 --> 2371.3199999999997
more refraction the more gets blurred up

2367.39 --> 2372.8799999999997
and also the closer by the limit of

2371.32 --> 2374.59
vision will be because at some point

2372.88 --> 2376.03
things will be so blurred up because of

2374.59 --> 2378.28
the refraction that literally you just

2376.03 --> 2380.6800000000003
see a wall or gray or whatever the

2378.28 --> 2386.6800000000003
background color is because it will be

2380.68 --> 2389.5299999999997
completely blurred out of uniformity so

2386.68 --> 2390.6099999999997
how far can things be loomed up from

2389.53 --> 2394.71
behind the horizon

2390.61 --> 2398.83
how far can the objects be loomed up

2394.71 --> 2400.93
what would be actually distant limits be

2398.83 --> 2403.0
to such a thing or it depends on the

2400.93 --> 2406.93
observer how Heights correlating with

2403.0 --> 2410.26
perspective and all that and yeah the

2406.93 --> 2414.25
limit of vision so the only limit as to

2410.26 --> 2416.23
how far an object looming can be visible

2414.25 --> 2419.16
how far that object actually is a way

2416.23 --> 2422.68
there is no limit to it except to the

2419.16 --> 2425.5299999999997
the ultimate limit of sight based on

2422.68 --> 2427.18
refraction up until things cannot be

2425.53 --> 2432.03
seen anymore because it's just blurred

2427.18 --> 2432.0299999999997
away I hope that answers the question

2436.51 --> 2444.0400000000004
okay crisis fuzzy TM I I will come back

2440.2 --> 2449.49
to you with that I'm looking forward to

2444.04 --> 2452.609
it it's good to have a new best song and

2449.49 --> 2457.72
yeah specially newcomers you know

2452.609 --> 2460.2999999999997
because it's it's scary starting to

2457.72 --> 2462.81
basically put yourself on YouTube in a

2460.3 --> 2465.82
way especially if you really wanted to

2462.81 --> 2469.119
and I'd love to help help people

2465.82 --> 2471.48
basically give a step up to get over

2469.119 --> 2471.48
that obstacle

2501.61 --> 2508.489
yeah

2503.64 --> 2514.979
hot Madras every day of your life really

2508.489 --> 2517.709
tough I would never want to eat the same

2514.979 --> 2520.109
freakin meal every day of my life and I

2517.709 --> 2522.719
would kind of know because I am pretty

2520.109 --> 2526.019
monotonous in my in the types of meals

2522.719 --> 2532.41
that I eat generally it's very limit

2526.019 --> 2534.93
it's typical guy maybe maybe not I don't

2532.41 --> 2537.209
know I think it's not as bad as some men

2534.93 --> 2541.019
out there that just only like the

2537.209 --> 2545.3089999999997
handful of things but I am pretty

2541.019 --> 2547.2
typically monotonous in my meals so I

2545.309 --> 2549.239
know what it is like to constantly eat

2547.2 --> 2552.6189999999997
the same thing sometimes and trust me

2549.239 --> 2555.359
this is you don't want to do it forever

2552.619 --> 2561.1800000000003
you will get sick of it no matter how

2555.359 --> 2568.199
good it tastes so you always got to

2561.18 --> 2570.18
change you know in a way the only doable

2568.199 --> 2571.9790000000003
way to get really monotonous with your

2570.18 --> 2573.989
meals is to basically switch back and

2571.979 --> 2575.729
forth between two types of meals you

2573.989 --> 2579.66
can't get more monotonous than that and

2575.729 --> 2584.459
you can I did that a period for like two

2579.66 --> 2587.249
years where I just I was in love with

2584.459 --> 2588.989
that food that I still make by the way

2587.249 --> 2591.839
sometimes and I would just do it

2588.989 --> 2593.88
constantly it wasn't a time when I still

2591.839 --> 2595.319
had more money when the inheritance

2593.88 --> 2598.969
money was still there so it was really

2595.319 --> 2602.609
no limit for me compared to well now

2598.969 --> 2603.869
what I could do food wise and was just

2602.609 --> 2607.369
freakin do that

2603.869 --> 2610.44
those two foods pretty much all the time

2607.369 --> 2612.2690000000002
but then yeah after a period I get sick

2610.44 --> 2617.15
of it suddenly it's like I don't want

2612.269 --> 2617.1499999999996
this anymore just just at all

2619.78 --> 2624.13
you try to avoid that now

2626.85 --> 2632.67
for me these days if I eat the same meal

2630.33 --> 2637.86
more than three times three days in a

2632.67 --> 2640.53
row then I get sick of it I'm noticing

2637.86 --> 2644.31
this every time now I don't have the I

2640.53 --> 2647.09
don't know the monotony food endurance

2644.31 --> 2647.09
as I used to

2655.87 --> 2658.5
what the

2658.56 --> 2664.7999999999997
we do death the same things that we

2662.99 --> 2669.3599999999997
that's hilarious

2664.8 --> 2673.5600000000004
yeah self-correcting phone it's a bad

2669.36 --> 2676.7400000000002
idea you know when i text i text every

2673.56 --> 2682.35
freaking letter the thing is i learned

2676.74 --> 2685.5299999999997
to do it so quickly it just didn't feel

2682.35 --> 2695.64
like a woodpecker and it works really

2685.53 --> 2698.25
well with buttons but i always avoided

2695.64 --> 2701.8199999999997
the text correction system that was

2698.25 --> 2705.33
already there like in the 90s and people

2701.82 --> 2708.8900000000003
were look hey you misspelled this word

2705.33 --> 2716.12
yeah it's autocorrection I didn't notice

2708.89 --> 2716.12
or so annoying so yeah I never used that

2726.45 --> 2730.819
yeah I don't even know what that is

2746.61 --> 2753.8
what nah

2750.33 --> 2757.98
I'm back it down was weird OBS

2753.8 --> 2765.44
disconnected suddenly but it reconnected

2757.98 --> 2765.44
I don't know yeah weird

2765.56 --> 2768.7599999999998
[Music]

2771.65 --> 2781.569
I don't know what it was maybe a no BS

2775.519 --> 2781.569
surfer glitch or something sudden drop

2786.45 --> 2794.569
is a matrix no don't read too much in it

2799.88 --> 2810.04
what Julie you're prepping really you

2803.36 --> 2814.48
need rice with every meal so I take it

2810.04 --> 2817.58
you're you're into Asian kitchen right

2814.48 --> 2823.52
because almost everything they eat is is

2817.58 --> 2827.45
always with rice in some way I'm the

2823.52 --> 2830.08
black cat excuse me I'm not an NPC

2827.45 --> 2830.08
program

2834.74 --> 2846.83
now if anything I I'm more like a now

2840.53 --> 2850.1600000000003
I'm gonna equip myself to anyone but I'm

2846.83 --> 2853.7
definitely not an NPC thank you I do not

2850.16 --> 2859.0099999999998
become possessed by agents I don't know

2853.7 --> 2863.3489999999997
sometimes I feel like I am a rogue agent

2859.01 --> 2863.349
except not in a robotic one

2868.81 --> 2879.87
like not an agent of the system just in

2871.98 --> 2882.79
an agent Packer could that be a thing I

2879.87 --> 2884.98
don't know who knows what the matrix is

2882.79 --> 2886.93
even gonna bring forth but just I don't

2884.98 --> 2890.2
know just quickly conjuring the

2886.93 --> 2893.83
conception the Matrix movie them in the

2890.2 --> 2897.8799999999997
matrix right hacking hacking a person

2893.83 --> 2902.38
like an agent that could be made into a

2897.88 --> 2904.87
thing it may ruin some of the original

2902.38 --> 2907.54
myth but yeah the freaking new movies

2904.87 --> 2909.64
always do that [ __ ] it's been a long

2907.54 --> 2912.52
time so it's never gonna be the same as

2909.64 --> 2913.81
the original ones never but who knows

2912.52 --> 2918.84
what they're going to do is like yeah

2913.81 --> 2924.18
maybe you could hack NPCs as a awoken

2918.84 --> 2924.1800000000003
person how about that

2927.38 --> 2930.98
wouldn't that be weird that you would I

2929.36 --> 2932.81
could imagine you'd like okay they're

2930.98 --> 2937.4900000000002
gonna walk up to a phone and then it's

2932.81 --> 2940.88
like okay connect you call him up and

2937.49 --> 2947.39
then certainly a person NPCs just like

2940.88 --> 2949.34
and yeah there then possessed by the but

2947.39 --> 2952.8199999999997
the user or something I don't know I'm

2949.34 --> 2960.17
just yeah science fiction in the matrix

2952.82 --> 2964.6000000000004
concept yeah they are making the matrix

2960.17 --> 2967.2200000000003
for and with Keanu Reeves no less so

2964.6 --> 2972.14
well if he's in it then apparently he

2967.22 --> 2975.3199999999997
got old somehow the the weird thing is

2972.14 --> 2977.27
originally I thought even I'm a even

2975.32 --> 2982.42
shared this I made a script for the

2977.27 --> 2984.95
matrix four and five like six years ago

2982.42 --> 2987.9500000000003
very sure it's basically a rough

2984.95 --> 2990.5299999999997
description it's not really a script

2987.95 --> 2993.41
it's not even in content scenes or

2990.53 --> 2995.21
anything it's just like a general story

2993.41 --> 2996.83
direction and all that like what what's

2995.21 --> 2999.41
gonna happen what turns out to be well

2996.83 --> 3001.81
of course it's got to turn out that the

2999.41 --> 3007.0
whole Zion and machine world is another

3001.81 --> 3008.86
matrix because I don't know they're

3007.0 --> 3010.48
never gonna do it probably or maybe they

3008.86 --> 3012.58
will or they'll do it in the wrong way

3010.48 --> 3015.58
because they always tend to screwed up

3012.58 --> 3022.29
these types of things but yeah with the

3015.58 --> 3025.0299999999997
matrix to remember neo solely says wait

3022.29 --> 3026.89
there's something different it turns

3025.03 --> 3028.78
around and this is in the machine world

3026.89 --> 3031.18
in the tunnel when they ship crashed

3028.78 --> 3033.5800000000004
where they landed and then the robots

3031.18 --> 3037.5099999999998
the octopi came I mean it just turns

3033.58 --> 3040.54
around this and suddenly they fall down

3037.51 --> 3043.86
they get electrocuted and fall down not

3040.54 --> 3048.4
from his hand so I just thought like

3043.86 --> 3052.06
okay he finally figured out that this is

3048.4 --> 3054.55
just another layer of the matrix but no

3052.06 --> 3059.38
they never addressed it and it just went

3054.55 --> 3063.55
away such an opportunity

3059.38 --> 3066.61
just a a multiple layer matrix that

3063.55 --> 3070.09
would be a lot more complex and like

3066.61 --> 3073.53
hard to get through and fundamental the

3070.09 --> 3077.1000000000004
deeper you go it would be basically

3073.53 --> 3085.17
reverse-engineer the spiritual ascension

3077.1 --> 3089.62
yeah an analogy a comparison to actual

3085.17 --> 3091.78
conscious awakening get more insights

3089.62 --> 3093.97
another layer but it's more difficult

3091.78 --> 3096.76
it's more pressure they could translate

3093.97 --> 3099.1
that in the very matrix layer system and

3096.76 --> 3102.1000000000004
who knows maybe they could even bring

3099.1 --> 3105.31
back like the architect and all that you

3102.1 --> 3108.58
know who is better to reveal to neo or

3105.31 --> 3111.64
basically to relate to be the person in

3108.58 --> 3114.52
order to let that conversation happen to

3111.64 --> 3117.91
arrive and say it seems like you finally

3114.52 --> 3119.41
figured out the second layer so what are

3117.91 --> 3121.35
you gonna do now with that knowledge are

3119.41 --> 3124.72
you still gonna take science seriously

3121.35 --> 3128.5899999999997
because you know now it's just another

3124.72 --> 3132.64
matrix so what is what is your plan now

3128.59 --> 3136.78
where is what is you yeah see the

3132.64 --> 3138.7599999999998
options the potential ah but you know

3136.78 --> 3141.51
they're not gonna do that you know

3138.76 --> 3141.51
they're not gonna do that

3150.54 --> 3155.349
right

3151.75 --> 3158.44
and then yeah spoilers spoilers for my

3155.349 --> 3162.04
own personal idea of the matrix what it

3158.44 --> 3165.4
would end up with is that Nia would

3162.04 --> 3168.25
start to remember the the mega fly scene

3165.4 --> 3171.869
where he flies through the entire city

3168.25 --> 3175.599
with Rumble behind him just to catch

3171.869 --> 3180.13
this could catch Trinity that was like

3175.599 --> 3183.369
falling to being shot that amazing scene

3180.13 --> 3187.7200000000003
right where he basically breaks the the

3183.369 --> 3189.6400000000003
yeah the all the rules just to to get

3187.72 --> 3190.839
something done just pure well that was a

3189.64 --> 3194.5589999999997
very powerful scene

3190.839 --> 3196.54
well what if at some point he would do

3194.559 --> 3200.1400000000003
multiple layer things will start to sink

3196.54 --> 3202.599
in and he would do that through the

3200.14 --> 3205.66
layers like he would literally break the

3202.599 --> 3211.71
the matrix physical boundaries and just

3205.66 --> 3214.75
go through it like opening up a wormhole

3211.71 --> 3216.79
like like how that's been conceptually

3214.75 --> 3221.349
in the matrix and just go through it

3216.79 --> 3223.99
into the yeah and then like for the

3221.349 --> 3226.4500000000003
tunnel through all the layers like a

3223.99 --> 3234.7299999999996
fractal or something you know almost

3226.45 --> 3237.8089999999997
like the an amazing space movie you 2010

3234.73 --> 3237.809
you know the one

3239.23 --> 3245.14
it's a it's not impossible it's

3241.72 --> 3248.5589999999997
necessary I love that movie anyway with

3245.14 --> 3252.04
the amazing for yeah going into the

3248.559 --> 3253.9900000000002
black hole and then the tesseract seen

3252.04 --> 3257.799
something in that day right like he

3253.99 --> 3260.68
could go through it and then yeah like

3257.799 --> 3267.04
going through the in the matrix then end

3260.68 --> 3269.6189999999997
up at the original mechanism the virtual

3267.04 --> 3273.579
part of the mechanism where the

3269.619 --> 3276.849
architect really is where his original

3273.579 --> 3278.71
program is kind of locked up in the they

3276.849 --> 3281.549
could make an ivory tower out of it that

3278.71 --> 3284.5
would be a fascinating fascinating

3281.549 --> 3286.69
symbol to make that and hey the deeper

3284.5 --> 3288.79
he would go the more symbolic and

3286.69 --> 3292.53
archaic things would naturally become

3288.79 --> 3295.119
because it can and because the symbol

3292.53 --> 3296.829
symbols of the surroundings world would

3295.119 --> 3299.17
become more important I don't know I'm

3296.829 --> 3302.1400000000003
now creating this entire mythos around

3299.17 --> 3303.76
the multiple layer matrix interstellar

3302.14 --> 3309.52
that's the one yeah that's the movie I

3303.76 --> 3312.869
compared the interdimensional tunneling

3309.52 --> 3315.63
that neo would eventually be doing

3312.869 --> 3319.7400000000002
through the matrix through the layers

3315.63 --> 3322.4500000000003
and of course a big part of that

3319.74 --> 3325.4199999999996
realization of multiple layer matrixes

3322.45 --> 3327.8799999999997
and this would be a cultural phenomena

3325.42 --> 3329.619
that would be so epic to put that in

3327.88 --> 3331.359
there they'd have to do it maybe they're

3329.619 --> 3334.21
still gonna do something like this in

3331.359 --> 3339.069
the matrix were but it should be done

3334.21 --> 3342.63
and that is that once neo would realize

3339.069 --> 3348.48
for example that desire on machine world

3342.63 --> 3351.9700000000003
layer is not the real world either that

3348.48 --> 3354.069
the other people that have awoken in

3351.97 --> 3359.77
there and have been fighting for that

3354.069 --> 3362.799
that day would turn into agents of that

3359.77 --> 3365.049
layer that they would protest that they

3362.799 --> 3368.819
would think look no he's crazy or this

3365.049 --> 3373.319
is his car is turned to the machines

3368.819 --> 3377.14
right and that they would start to then

3373.319 --> 3379.299
agents at him from that layer and that

3377.14 --> 3384.49
that would keep happening can you see

3379.299 --> 3390.52
the epic power of this what could be

3384.49 --> 3392.049
done I I wish I wish somebody over in

3390.52 --> 3396.49
Hollywood would be listening to this

3392.049 --> 3402.0099999999998
stuff because the problem yeah I don't

3396.49 --> 3407.74
know man I don't know this but yeah I do

3402.01 --> 3410.5
love sci-fi a lot I do and the matrix is

3407.74 --> 3413.2
a very important movie to me I must

3410.5 --> 3416.829
start writing it is all conceptual zit

3413.2 --> 3419.589
is setting it is scenarios cultural

3416.829 --> 3421.799
correlating scenarios that is the type

3419.589 --> 3424.96
of thing that I think of it's like a

3421.799 --> 3427.329
painting of a picture and sort of what

3424.96 --> 3429.96
people are doing more like a fresco in

3427.329 --> 3433.869
ancient times that is what I see and

3429.96 --> 3437.109
that could be lent to make a movie

3433.869 --> 3438.9100000000003
within a story structure and acts but

3437.109 --> 3443.98
that's not really in the way that I

3438.91 --> 3447.91
think I have visions and views and like

3443.98 --> 3450.579
analogies that's how I see movie scripts

3447.91 --> 3453.549
in sci-fi and stuff and I have wrote

3450.579 --> 3456.099
something down but I am not really a

3453.549 --> 3461.31
script writer and not really a story

3456.099 --> 3465.3
writer that it's just not

3461.31 --> 3466.92
yeah I'm not not like that anyway yeah

3465.3 --> 3469.23
I'll probably get back to who knows

3466.92 --> 3471.75
maybe I will read out some of the

3469.23 --> 3474.78
original things that I wrote down to be

3471.75 --> 3476.4
fair okay and again this is very our win

3474.78 --> 3478.9500000000003
Ian and I'm gonna round out the show

3476.4 --> 3482.07
soon right away but a lot of the things

3478.95 --> 3484.74
that I just said about the matrix about

3482.07 --> 3487.5
going through like the wormhole effect

3484.74 --> 3490.77
right I've never thought that before

3487.5 --> 3493.17
that literally arrived to me as I was

3490.77 --> 3496.98
thinking about it's just the original

3493.17 --> 3499.05
idea just expanded out of nowhere so a

3496.98 --> 3504.27
lot of the things that I even said about

3499.05 --> 3506.25
it in this hangout literally arrived for

3504.27 --> 3510.45
the first time in my mind as I was

3506.25 --> 3513.24
talking about it and it might be worth

3510.45 --> 3515.31
actually listening back to this and

3513.24 --> 3517.68
making some notes to add on to the

3515.31 --> 3520.16
original scrap because I thought that I

3517.68 --> 3524.91
had some really interesting ideas

3520.16 --> 3526.68
especially yeah the multiple agent the

3524.91 --> 3528.87
agent response from the other layer

3526.68 --> 3532.5
that's the first time I thought of that

3528.87 --> 3537.93
and it's an awesome idea it is awesome

3532.5 --> 3541.14
it is epic right so anyway thanks

3537.93 --> 3544.1099999999997
everyone for coming I hope you like to

3541.14 --> 3545.94
show I certainly did this fight that

3544.11 --> 3548.34
there seemed to be a lot of trolls that

3545.94 --> 3552.92
really didn't like it oh so painful to

3548.34 --> 3555.84
them - 70 votes it's oh well who cares

3552.92 --> 3557.55
if you liked it don't forget to Rogen's

3555.84 --> 3559.26
up and if you haven't already subscribe

3557.55 --> 3560.9100000000003
to my channel and hit about notification

3559.26 --> 3562.4700000000003
so you know when I'm going live which is

3560.91 --> 3564.42
normally 2:00 p.m. and so damn time

3562.47 --> 3566.79
every day although sometimes a little

3564.42 --> 3569.58
bit late like today and sometimes a

3566.79 --> 3571.88
little bit soon like yesterday so don't

3569.58 --> 3575.0099999999998
complain about me being late please

3571.88 --> 3577.32
that's because sometimes I'm early too

3575.01 --> 3579.8100000000004
anyway please don't forget to also

3577.32 --> 3582.9
support me and my channel through the

3579.81 --> 3584.45
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

3582.9 --> 3586.98
chats of course

3584.45 --> 3589.14
ok I'm gonna join the Flat Earth debates

3586.98 --> 3591.15
which has already started like who 10

3589.14 --> 3593.85
minutes ago so I'm gonna go there as

3591.15 --> 3594.89
soon as I the show ends and I will be

3593.85 --> 3600.65
back tomorrow with

3594.89 --> 3603.95
flatters earlybird number 434 hashtag

3600.65 --> 3607.779
meifa indeed over Mukul until the next

3603.95 --> 3607.779
video keep it flat

3608.35 --> 3638.7
