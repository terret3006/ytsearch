155.36 --> 159.44000000000003
before i even went out for groceries

157.2 --> 162.319
because i was really hungry but

159.44 --> 163.599
now i feel like so slow

162.319 --> 166.39999999999998
this is

163.599 --> 171.0
weird i hope i'll like

166.4 --> 171.0

174.16 --> 179.92
so we'll see what happens today

177.68 --> 183.36
hello neil degrasse tyson lies first in

179.92 --> 184.879
chat pj cnet elise g

183.36 --> 190.92000000000002
good to see you all

184.879 --> 190.92
it is friday the 29th of april 2022.

192.72 --> 197.04
low terror 306.

195.599 --> 200.48
yeah yesterday

197.04 --> 201.84
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

200.48 --> 203.84
so yeah

201.84 --> 206.48
some weird technical difficulties like

203.84 --> 206.48
halfway but

206.959 --> 210.239
second part went

208.959 --> 214.879
extra long

210.239 --> 214.879
and the after show was incredibly long

215.519 --> 220.12
it was like a four hour show together

230.56 --> 236.72
and yeah

232.64 --> 238.95899999999997
a lot was discussed in all that time

236.72 --> 243.28
talking yeah eventually ended up with

238.959 --> 243.28
talking nathan going against dies slow

243.599 --> 248.48
because he was like

246.159 --> 250.48
getting all

248.48 --> 252.879
doubling down on the ether even though

250.48 --> 254.39999999999998
nathan asked him to define it and he

252.879 --> 256.479
just would only

254.4 --> 257.28000000000003
describe it

256.479 --> 258.799
like

257.28 --> 263.03999999999996
what it is like

258.799 --> 263.03999999999996
constantly and he wouldn't just actually

263.12 --> 269.12
say what it is and that's the problem

265.199 --> 271.44
right it's like gravity

269.12 --> 272.479
like oh they all believe it and it's

271.44 --> 275.12
everything

272.479 --> 277.68
but they can't actually pinpoint what it

275.12 --> 277.68
really is

278.0 --> 282.56
and that's pretty much what the second

279.84 --> 284.71999999999997
half of that show was about

282.56 --> 284.72
uh

286.56 --> 291.84
should probably be seeing it like

289.04 --> 295.47900000000004
saturday or sunday

291.84 --> 295.479
hey borders boy

300.88 --> 303.88
ah

315.759 --> 320.36
hey mike sidinich good to see you

332.32 --> 336.8
right so i've been following also some

334.16 --> 339.52000000000004
of owen benjamin

336.8 --> 341.28000000000003
who's like really

339.52 --> 344.0
engaged now with the whole rockman

341.28 --> 344.0
situation

344.08 --> 349.919
and yeah it's it is really embarrassing

347.36 --> 351.84000000000003
like it is

349.919 --> 354.479
i don't know who that guy was over at

351.84 --> 357.28
rockfin that called him up but like he

354.479 --> 359.75899999999996
shot himself in the foot big time that

357.28 --> 361.52
was really really freaking dumb and he

359.759 --> 364.84000000000003
didn't know any

361.52 --> 367.28
humility was he was a complete

364.84 --> 370.0
gamma so

367.28 --> 371.52
yeah we'll see what happens

370.0 --> 373.199
but yeah the uh

371.52 --> 375.84
it has certainly been

373.199 --> 378.08000000000004
infusing a lot of energy into owen it

375.84 --> 381.28
was like really on points

378.08 --> 383.35999999999996
and very detailed in his analysis

381.28 --> 385.28
and funny

383.36 --> 388.0
it makes a lot of good points about

385.28 --> 390.71999999999997
comedy and about platforms so i'm really

388.0 --> 390.72
enjoying that

390.96 --> 395.84
can't wait to finish the rockfin saga

398.96 --> 403.56
yup to you okay my accident

425.68 --> 429.039
uh right what else

434.72 --> 438.88000000000005
i think i spent most of the time just

436.96 --> 441.75899999999996
doing that

438.88 --> 444.24
i mean fed after show took up like

441.759 --> 444.24
forever

449.199 --> 452.08

453.84 --> 457.67999999999995
oh yeah completely missed made by jim

455.759 --> 459.52000000000004
bob because yeah that was pretty much

457.68 --> 461.52
still when we were doing the after show

459.52 --> 464.52
recording

461.52 --> 464.52
uh

466.8 --> 470.40000000000003
or

467.68 --> 472.40000000000003
if not i missed it because i was doing

470.4 --> 476.15999999999997
other stuff

472.4 --> 476.15999999999997

jason

770.839 --> 776.5600000000001
brown yeah so i don't know i might be

774.48 --> 778.5600000000001
rounding out a little i don't know why

776.56 --> 782.16
maybe it's the sudden weather change and

778.56 --> 784.2399999999999
it's just i'm off guard or something

782.16 --> 786.7199999999999
i don't feel great today it's not like

784.24 --> 788.48
something terrible it's just my stomach

786.72 --> 789.6
is just

788.48 --> 792.95
not

789.6 --> 797.669
being cooperative

792.95 --> 797.6690000000001
[Music]

821.6 --> 824.6
hmm

862.16 --> 865.36
all right can have every day be a good

864.399 --> 867.36
day

865.36 --> 871.0790000000001
i've had some pretty good shows in a

867.36 --> 871.0790000000001
recent time so

882.079 --> 886.8
it's one of those days yeah sorry guys

887.839 --> 892.0
like i'm gonna try to sit through this

889.76 --> 893.68
but if it's like still exactly like this

892.0 --> 895.6
in like 10 minutes and i'm just gonna

893.68 --> 899.56
round out the show because it's

895.6 --> 899.5600000000001
like really distracting

901.44 --> 907.12
yeah i can't really

903.92 --> 907.12
focus right now

907.76 --> 913.36
so i'm just noticing i'm trying to avoid

909.839 --> 916.8800000000001
subjects so that's not a good sign

913.36 --> 919.519
means i don't feel really great

916.88 --> 922.959
and what is i just i got like stomach

919.519 --> 922.9590000000001
tension issues again

923.12 --> 926.88
it's probably because of the sudden

924.639 --> 930.0
weather change and because i had lunch

926.88 --> 933.279
really early but it's just it's like

930.0 --> 933.279
was too much or something

933.44 --> 940.519
i've been kind of feeling like this

935.6 --> 940.519
ever yeah for two hours or so

941.44 --> 944.72
but yeah when i then actually want to do

943.68 --> 947.12
a show

944.72 --> 950.0
i have to kind of climb up the ladder

947.12 --> 954.279
because i get more focused and now it's

950.0 --> 954.279
like really getting in the way

955.9 --> 958.98
[Music]

967.36 --> 970.8000000000001
wow look at that

971.6 --> 975.12
i think we got a derp alert

975.839 --> 979.399
maybe i'll help

979.86 --> 985.12
[Music]

982.48 --> 987.6800000000001
nathan's trying to bully me

985.12 --> 988.9590000000001
no he's not

987.68 --> 991.5999999999999
it just

988.959 --> 994.0
holds me up to very high standards and

991.6 --> 997.0
makes it very hard on me

994.0 --> 997.0
and

997.279 --> 1001.8389999999999
it's

998.24 --> 1001.839
not like i can't handle it

1002.56 --> 1007.68
so

1004.56 --> 1010.8
and hey if he goes too far in my opinion

1007.68 --> 1012.88
and i can underbuild that opinion

1010.8 --> 1014.8
then i will absolutely face him right

1012.88 --> 1017.4399999999999
there alive for everybody to see and you

1014.8 --> 1017.4399999999999
all know that

1018.079 --> 1022.519
so i'm not worried in the slightest

1030.72 --> 1034.799
right but i am gonna

1032.4 --> 1036.88
take a bit of a walk outside on the roof

1034.799 --> 1039.36
and

1036.88 --> 1042.24
breathe in some extra fresh air seem to

1039.36 --> 1042.24
see if that helps

1043.839 --> 1047.72
all right i'll be right back

1086.48 --> 1089.48
so

1188.4 --> 1193.8400000000001
okay and i'm back

1190.16 --> 1196.799
that helped some

1193.84 --> 1200.72
i might do that again in a few

1196.799 --> 1204.1589999999999
because yeah the air was really nice

1200.72 --> 1204.159
that certainly did help

1205.76 --> 1210.799
oh that negative toxic influence well

1208.799 --> 1213.2
how can i get away from that grace's

1210.799 --> 1215.28
game life i mean

1213.2 --> 1217.3600000000001
people like you come into my chat

1215.28 --> 1219.76
constantly

1217.36 --> 1222.08
that's not gonna stop one like if i

1219.76 --> 1225.28
would ever choose to not be on nathan's

1222.08 --> 1226.8799999999999
show anymore for some stupid reason

1225.28 --> 1228.48
yeah

1226.88 --> 1230.0
i know better

1228.48 --> 1232.96
besides

1230.0 --> 1236.4
nathan and me have a lot of

1232.96 --> 1239.3600000000001
high level mutual interests

1236.4 --> 1242.4
that we're building on together

1239.36 --> 1245.1999999999998
like collectively and it's really tough

1242.4 --> 1246.8400000000001
to find people that are on that level

1245.2 --> 1250.0
it's really

1246.84 --> 1252.559
really tough

1250.0 --> 1253.6
almost unique

1252.559 --> 1254.96
so

1253.6 --> 1257.4399999999998
yeah

1254.96 --> 1262.159
there's a good reason

1257.44 --> 1266.48
that we have the interactions we do

1262.159 --> 1267.8400000000001
i i test nathan i test his

1266.48 --> 1269.44
his patience

1267.84 --> 1272.48
and his

1269.44 --> 1275.52
his sharpness if he can distinguish like

1272.48 --> 1278.08
i present him very complex puzzles

1275.52 --> 1280.96
and that's rare because most people that

1278.08 --> 1282.799
do that do it to try to break your mind

1280.96 --> 1284.0
and then he immediately gets an allergic

1282.799 --> 1287.12
response

1284.0 --> 1290.32
he still wants to understand

1287.12 --> 1293.4399999999998
and i can provide him with those types

1290.32 --> 1296.799
of puzzles from a friendly angle

1293.44 --> 1298.72
and that's very rare for him

1296.799 --> 1300.6399999999999
right that's why he doesn't allow that

1298.72 --> 1303.1200000000001
with a lot of people

1300.64 --> 1305.76
i he allows it with me because we have a

1303.12 --> 1307.84
clear understanding of the rules and

1305.76 --> 1311.28
what is what

1307.84 --> 1312.32
don't overblow it don't reify it

1311.28 --> 1314.8799999999999
right

1312.32 --> 1316.6399999999999
with a very high level understanding and

1314.88 --> 1319.2
that's very rare

1316.64 --> 1321.44
and that creates different social

1319.2 --> 1323.52
dynamics i had the same thing with my

1321.44 --> 1325.76
older brother

1323.52 --> 1326.96
he was the first person i had that type

1325.76 --> 1329.52
of a

1326.96 --> 1331.039
connection with and we had the same type

1329.52 --> 1334.48
of chemistry

1331.039 --> 1337.84
i would constantly nag my brother

1334.48 --> 1340.64
but it would really stimulate him

1337.84 --> 1342.32
and i did get like things wrong and he

1340.64 --> 1344.24
would then correct me and i would learn

1342.32 --> 1347.76
so much and would be so thankful i had

1344.24 --> 1349.679
like the highest possible respect for my

1347.76 --> 1352.96
brother even though he wasn't perfect

1349.679 --> 1352.96
and i was aware of that

1354.64 --> 1359.8400000000001
and then yeah after some time

1357.52 --> 1360.96
things happen with me crazy things and

1359.84 --> 1363.52
with him

1360.96 --> 1364.88
he kind of moved on

1363.52 --> 1367.6
sort of

1364.88 --> 1370.24
yeah he has kids now and a wife

1367.6 --> 1372.32
i don't know if he's married but

1370.24 --> 1376.559
so he's doing that

1372.32 --> 1379.84
and yeah he did like kind of lay down

1376.559 --> 1381.76
that high level he kind of lost interest

1379.84 --> 1385.6
because just the world so [ __ ] up and

1381.76 --> 1386.84
he liked the aloneness

1385.6 --> 1388.48
of it

1386.84 --> 1391.9189999999999
right

1388.48 --> 1394.799
people give up their minds because of

1391.919 --> 1394.7990000000002
the loneliness

1396.72 --> 1399.6000000000001
and it's

1398.48 --> 1401.039
terrible

1399.6 --> 1403.36
right i've

1401.039 --> 1406.24
done pretty much everything in my power

1403.36 --> 1406.24
to prevent that

1407.679 --> 1411.039
it's been a project of mine my entire

1410.08 --> 1414.08
life

1411.039 --> 1414.08
to not do that

1415.84 --> 1418.6399999999999
anyway

1417.12 --> 1421.279
trying to help

1418.64 --> 1424.0
he doesn't see you as his equal

1421.279 --> 1426.72
well i don't see him as my equal

1424.0 --> 1426.72
what's your point

1429.12 --> 1434.32
we aren't equal

1432.0 --> 1434.32
yeah

1435.679 --> 1439.44
nathan

1437.039 --> 1443.44
approaches people

1439.44 --> 1444.88
by their standard of knowledge and grip

1443.44 --> 1447.279
and

1444.88 --> 1449.44
so do i with him

1447.279 --> 1451.6
but yeah at some point there's going to

1449.44 --> 1454.24
be periods when you're like have lesser

1451.6 --> 1456.3999999999999
grip or where you have less

1454.24 --> 1458.559
will to be

1456.4 --> 1461.2
to have humility about it

1458.559 --> 1465.12
you're going to be bluffing a bit

1461.2 --> 1465.1200000000001
it's okay i can see right through that

1466.72 --> 1473.76
in the end it only matters that you

1469.84 --> 1475.76
that you were coming across

1473.76 --> 1478.48
and that you were correct

1475.76 --> 1482.08
or that your train of thinking at least

1478.48 --> 1484.48
was correctly founded

1482.08 --> 1485.76
and that's what i am able and in the

1484.48 --> 1487.52
beginning

1485.76 --> 1489.52
was a lot of friction and all that

1487.52 --> 1491.84
always has been between nathan and me

1489.52 --> 1494.4
not all the time but sometimes

1491.84 --> 1496.9599999999998
the beginning was very messy i would go

1494.4 --> 1499.44
rage when i'm in

1496.96 --> 1500.72
i don't really have to do that anymore

1499.44 --> 1502.4
like that

1500.72 --> 1504.32
there's some others though that

1502.4 --> 1506.48
sometimes like

1504.32 --> 1508.08
tend to like really get on my nerve and

1506.48 --> 1511.039
when they make it personal and they and

1508.08 --> 1514.799
they think it's okay to shave me that's

1511.039 --> 1517.44
now when i do the rage win right but it

1514.799 --> 1519.679
yeah it's getting better and better

1517.44 --> 1523.6000000000001
and i'm getting so much out of it and

1519.679 --> 1523.6000000000001
they're getting so much out of me

1524.799 --> 1530.48
i mean

1527.2 --> 1532.0
a lot of what i know

1530.48 --> 1534.88
is thanks to

1532.0 --> 1537.679
being constantly involved with nathan

1534.88 --> 1538.64
and the fed panel

1537.679 --> 1540.72
right

1538.64 --> 1543.72
you have to remember that the way that i

1540.72 --> 1543.72
work

1544.08 --> 1549.76
i need interaction i need interaction

1547.2 --> 1550.88
and then i can actually kind of like

1549.76 --> 1551.6
ride

1550.88 --> 1553.679
or

1551.6 --> 1556.8799999999999
land if you it's not stealing because

1553.679 --> 1560.72
i'm not taking it away from the person

1556.88 --> 1560.72
i'm just using what they have

1560.88 --> 1565.44
and

1561.679 --> 1567.679
being better at what i'm doing

1565.44 --> 1570.0
i can use their power

1567.679 --> 1572.0800000000002
literally to me that's what it's like

1570.0 --> 1573.679
like i use

1572.08 --> 1576.08
your power

1573.679 --> 1577.039
the people here in chat

1576.08 --> 1580.3999999999999
you see

1577.039 --> 1580.4
that's why i need you

1580.64 --> 1586.24
to initiate a train of thinking

1584.32 --> 1588.3999999999999
to an idea some

1586.24 --> 1591.84
something and then

1588.4 --> 1593.919
i kind of use you what you did

1591.84 --> 1596.72
latch on to that and then suddenly it

1593.919 --> 1600.0800000000002
becomes really easy for me to like make

1596.72 --> 1602.88
a giant informative painting about it

1600.08 --> 1602.8799999999999
it's what i do

1602.96 --> 1607.3600000000001
and when i was very young i used to do

1605.2 --> 1609.3600000000001
that neurotically and it was always in

1607.36 --> 1611.279
people's way because they would be

1609.36 --> 1613.36
basically doing something in a routine

1611.279 --> 1615.52
and then halfway start rumpusing right

1613.36 --> 1617.279
over them with like really brilliant

1615.52 --> 1619.279
ideas

1617.279 --> 1622.96
and people would get sick of it they'd

1619.279 --> 1626.48
be like dude just shut the [ __ ] up

1622.96 --> 1629.52
stop interrupting me just let me say

1626.48 --> 1629.52
what i want to say

1629.679 --> 1633.039
stop

1630.88 --> 1636.24
like trying to improve everything all

1633.039 --> 1638.32
the time neurotically right i've gotten

1636.24 --> 1640.72
in under control somewhat but it's kind

1638.32 --> 1645.039
of a universal thing in a lot of like

1640.72 --> 1647.44
people that are truth or truth adjacent

1645.039 --> 1650.32
the rumpusing

1647.44 --> 1652.96
right is that impulse what is that

1650.32 --> 1654.96
impact what is the impulse of rumpusing

1652.96 --> 1657.6000000000001
right that eventually results in the

1654.96 --> 1661.3600000000001
behavior of rhombusing

1657.6 --> 1661.36
it's a fount of energy

1661.52 --> 1668.559
and that found of energy brings a whole

1664.399 --> 1671.039
range of data and specificity within it

1668.559 --> 1672.6399999999999
that you can place right and that's why

1671.039 --> 1673.76
you feel the urge like you have to say

1672.64 --> 1677.3600000000001
it now

1673.76 --> 1677.36
if you can get control over that

1677.84 --> 1682.799
look at the power you potentially have

1680.159 --> 1686.159
if you can just

1682.799 --> 1689.12
focus on what comes in

1686.159 --> 1692.159
in that moment beyond the moment

1689.12 --> 1694.2399999999998
can you hold on to that brilliance that

1692.159 --> 1698.24
came in there

1694.24 --> 1699.279
for a second without rumpusing

1698.24 --> 1702.24
then

1699.279 --> 1704.32
you got power you got power available to

1702.24 --> 1708.64
you that's what i got

1704.32 --> 1711.12
it's part of my my discipline

1708.64 --> 1712.88
it's very tough especially when you're

1711.12 --> 1715.12
like breaking open

1712.88 --> 1718.0
a new subject right when it's like a

1715.12 --> 1721.4399999999998
really brand new it's unique new

1718.0 --> 1722.88
and it's very difficult not to break in

1721.44 --> 1725.44
right very

1722.88 --> 1727.7600000000002
the newer it is the harder it is the

1725.44 --> 1729.6000000000001
tougher it is not to break in

1727.76 --> 1731.6
because it's so tempting it's so

1729.6 --> 1733.84
beautiful it's so new

1731.6 --> 1735.6
learn to hold on to it or

1733.84 --> 1737.52
some people

1735.6 --> 1738.48
learn the discipline where they just

1737.52 --> 1740.32
quickly

1738.48 --> 1742.48
grab a note and just write it down and

1740.32 --> 1745.84
they become really good at that so good

1742.48 --> 1747.44
that they don't even have to focus

1745.84 --> 1749.279
it's never really worked for me like

1747.44 --> 1750.0800000000002
that

1749.279 --> 1752.88
i

1750.08 --> 1755.52
was always a verbal communicator

1752.88 --> 1758.0
so for me it just doesn't really work

1755.52 --> 1758.0
like that

1758.48 --> 1765.039
i have to like learn to hold on to it to

1761.2 --> 1767.52
like let that full glory of that few

1765.039 --> 1768.559
moments of insight like sit there in a

1767.52 --> 1770.799
very

1768.559 --> 1773.039
tight balloon in a container

1770.799 --> 1774.72
and sit through time unchanged it will

1773.039 --> 1776.24
be changed a little right it's going to

1774.72 --> 1779.1200000000001
adapt even

1776.24 --> 1782.0
but to have the true found of energy

1779.12 --> 1784.2399999999998
still there contained for as long as i

1782.0 --> 1784.24
can

1785.039 --> 1789.84
and then

1786.96 --> 1792.0
yeah you got a brilliant idea

1789.84 --> 1793.6
potentially if it is really brilliant

1792.0 --> 1796.24
right because

1793.6 --> 1797.84
you can have b rompassy and think that

1796.24 --> 1801.2
you have a brilliant idea it's something

1797.84 --> 1801.1999999999998
that you just really want to say

1801.44 --> 1806.48
but yeah it might turn out not to be all

1803.44 --> 1808.64
that brilliant when it's tested

1806.48 --> 1810.72
and this is another reason why i like to

1808.64 --> 1813.76
go to nathan

1810.72 --> 1815.279
to have my concepts tested and sometimes

1813.76 --> 1817.52
very tough to get in between there

1815.279 --> 1819.039
because not always guys aren't always in

1817.52 --> 1821.6
the mood for that

1819.039 --> 1822.72
oh great another arwenian weirdo wizard

1821.6 --> 1824.32
idea

1822.72 --> 1826.48
right they're now in the mood for it so

1824.32 --> 1828.559
they kind of like sort of push me to the

1826.48 --> 1830.08
side not address me

1828.559 --> 1832.08
it happens too

1830.08 --> 1837.08
i can't expect them

1832.08 --> 1837.08
to always deal with what i do

1837.36 --> 1842.24
anyway

1839.36 --> 1846.1589999999999
hello regard so thank you notice me

1842.24 --> 1849.159
senpai what i don't know what that means

1846.159 --> 1849.159
anyway

1853.6 --> 1857.84
why doesn't he come on your show to

1855.36 --> 1858.8799999999999
support it are you kidding me grace game

1857.84 --> 1862.6399999999999
life

1858.88 --> 1864.72
nathan does come on my show and he do

1862.64 --> 1866.48
he actually does send me paypal

1864.72 --> 1867.6000000000001
sometimes

1866.48 --> 1870.08
it's

1867.6 --> 1872.7199999999998
ceremonial almost

1870.08 --> 1874.6399999999999
but that's more than nothing and i

1872.72 --> 1877.3600000000001
really do it pretty even a little bit i

1874.64 --> 1879.519
mean it's mostly you guys right like

1877.36 --> 1881.76
elise g and

1879.519 --> 1884.64
gordzilla and

1881.76 --> 1884.64
rick peck and

1885.039 --> 1888.96
tony whitcomb and

1887.6 --> 1890.6399999999999
all you guys

1888.96 --> 1893.8400000000001
you're the like the much bigger

1890.64 --> 1894.88
supporters but nathan also does that

1893.84 --> 1897.12
actually

1894.88 --> 1897.1200000000001
so

1900.08 --> 1904.84
i think you've just been listening to

1902.0 --> 1908.24
too much like

1904.84 --> 1911.279
anti-nathony fanfics

1908.24 --> 1913.44
and they have to be there i bet they are

1911.279 --> 1915.279
there i bet there's people literally

1913.44 --> 1918.0800000000002
writing like

1915.279 --> 1921.76
negative fanfiction about nathan

1918.08 --> 1923.12
like they would have to at this point

1921.76 --> 1928.1589999999999
i mean

1923.12 --> 1928.1589999999999
if you have that ability to do that

1928.559 --> 1934.08
then nathan is like a must

1931.919 --> 1935.8400000000001
you would have to do that i bet there

1934.08 --> 1937.84
are people doing that there and pete bet

1935.84 --> 1940.799
that people are doing that there

1937.84 --> 1943.519
and it turns out that their fan fiction

1940.799 --> 1945.76
is actually so

1943.519 --> 1948.08
infused with inspiration that it's

1945.76 --> 1950.08
almost like too good to just throw it

1948.08 --> 1952.8799999999999
out there as a joke

1950.08 --> 1956.0
they probably made brilliant writing

1952.88 --> 1960.3200000000002
works based originally off

1956.0 --> 1960.32
negative fan fiction of nathan oakley

1961.36 --> 1965.039
i might be bluffing a little here

1965.2 --> 1968.96
but

1966.88 --> 1974.159
you know

1968.96 --> 1974.159
how deeply nathan inspires people

1975.039 --> 1980.559
yeah and that's what it is

1977.279 --> 1982.399
right negative positive it's energy what

1980.559 --> 1984.559
do you do with that energy once it

1982.399 --> 1987.039
arrives are you gonna

1984.559 --> 1990.32
use it to bash somebody's head in

1987.039 --> 1991.76
make you seem better or are you going to

1990.32 --> 1993.4399999999998
enlighten them

1991.76 --> 1995.279
and then how do you do that you can't

1993.44 --> 1998.64
always do it the way you want it in

1995.279 --> 1998.64
order to accomplish that

2000.48 --> 2005.19
right

2002.08 --> 2005.1899999999998
[Music]

2006.08 --> 2010.96
if that fvd is a bit repetitive it's a

2008.559 --> 2013.6789999999999
true but yeah but it has to be

2010.96 --> 2013.679
gorzilla

2016.0 --> 2018.559
i

2016.84 --> 2021.279
mean

2018.559 --> 2022.6399999999999
i mean it's like the altar it's like

2021.279 --> 2023.44
that's

2022.64 --> 2025.919
it

2023.44 --> 2027.6000000000001
it is the in a way the core it's like a

2025.919 --> 2030.5590000000002
mechanical core this is like an

2027.6 --> 2032.8799999999999
information query is like we are

2030.559 --> 2036.08
the guys me not even that much i'm just

2032.88 --> 2038.24
an oracle they are like the real wizards

2036.08 --> 2039.36
that do

2038.24 --> 2041.6
deep

2039.36 --> 2043.9189999999999
information studies like

2041.6 --> 2047.9189999999999
freaking 10th man like has read every

2043.919 --> 2050.879
single book that involves sexton's ever

2047.919 --> 2053.919
by now that's crazy right but that's the

2050.879 --> 2055.919
level of dedication

2053.919 --> 2058.0
that is actually present

2055.919 --> 2058.839
in fed and he's not the only one that's

2058.0 --> 2060.96
that

2058.839 --> 2063.2
focused right

2060.96 --> 2064.96
that means something so this is the

2063.2 --> 2067.6789999999996
place where it all comes together this

2064.96 --> 2071.359
is the altar where things happen

2067.679 --> 2073.04
it has to be laid out it's there to get

2071.359 --> 2075.2
through to the people

2073.04 --> 2079.44
that are

2075.2 --> 2082.3199999999997
stubborn unto death right it's like

2079.44 --> 2084.399
fed is the altar where you go

2082.32 --> 2086.56
where you either wake up

2084.399 --> 2088.56
or you perish

2086.56 --> 2090.639
and it's like it's like

2088.56 --> 2092.24
you're freed from your shackles or you

2090.639 --> 2096.159
go to hell

2092.24 --> 2097.2
you're gonna experience like like deep

2096.159 --> 2099.2000000000003
deep

2097.2 --> 2100.16
humiliation

2099.2 --> 2102.24
right

2100.16 --> 2105.2799999999997
let's write that

2102.24 --> 2107.4399999999996
if you don't have humility you will be

2105.28 --> 2111.3590000000004
humiliated

2107.44 --> 2111.359
so happy to remember that title

2112.079 --> 2119.32
that's going to be the title of this

2114.0 --> 2119.32
show thought of it like a week ago but

2123.78 --> 2132.8100000000004

2163.599 --> 2168.32
because he gets me going like that

2165.359 --> 2170.4
because jim bob is a higher detailed

2168.32 --> 2172.96
thinker and he's absolutely

2170.4 --> 2175.44
proven that like no other place

2172.96 --> 2177.44
when he went up against brenda

2175.44 --> 2179.92
that he proved

2177.44 --> 2182.079
the level of detail and

2179.92 --> 2184.079
control he has on a micro scale and

2182.079 --> 2186.8
that's very impressive and that's very

2184.079 --> 2188.7200000000003
inspiring to me that makes me open that

2186.8 --> 2193.52
curtain and show like oh

so you can actually see what i do then

2193.839 --> 2197.32

2209.52 --> 2215.24
nathan is a master at the fine art of

2211.68 --> 2215.24
tea bagging yes

2219.52 --> 2221.92
i mean

2222.079 --> 2225.079
yeah

2228.48 --> 2233.76
just like a god

2230.88 --> 2234.8
the devil is invention oh dear god look

2233.76 --> 2236.8
as

2234.8 --> 2239.2000000000003
we got derp alert

2236.8 --> 2241.44
no it doesn't makes it yeah it does

2239.2 --> 2243.2
it does it's right there

2241.44 --> 2244.16
right here right now

2243.2 --> 2246.16
yeah

2244.16 --> 2248.7999999999997
it's not what ha is not where you're

2246.16 --> 2251.2
sent after you die

2248.8 --> 2254.5600000000004
it's a parallel dimension that you touch

2251.2 --> 2256.0789999999997
upon you can touch upon right here right

2254.56 --> 2257.2799999999997
now

2256.079 --> 2258.8
yeah

2257.28 --> 2261.119
how does it happen

2258.8 --> 2263.119
through your dreams usually

2261.119 --> 2266.079
that's where it it starts to visually

2263.119 --> 2267.44
express itself but it will be like

2266.079 --> 2269.8390000000004
hidden

2267.44 --> 2273.92
your consciousness will try to hide it

2269.839 --> 2275.119
within your experience it's right there

2273.92 --> 2278.88
hell

2275.119 --> 2281.52
heaven it's right there right now

2278.88 --> 2283.359
that's where that is

2281.52 --> 2287.68
it's parallel

2283.359 --> 2287.68
only thing you have to do is see it

2295.76 --> 2303.0400000000004
yeah devil just look good invention oh

2299.52 --> 2303.04
you don't believe anything uh

2306.72 --> 2310.8799999999997
yeah i'm sorry but

2308.8 --> 2313.52
yeah whether you believe in some like

2310.88 --> 2315.6800000000003
spirit beings

2313.52 --> 2317.839
right that's separate like i don't even

2315.68 --> 2321.2
think of god like that i just see god as

2317.839 --> 2323.68
a necessary antecedent for existence

2321.2 --> 2326.3199999999997
because it is provably provably

2323.68 --> 2327.44
physically ontological primitive

2326.32 --> 2330.6400000000003
like

2327.44 --> 2332.32
there is no way to conceive

2330.64 --> 2335.359
in full honesty

2332.32 --> 2338.4
a system in which there wouldn't be a

2335.359 --> 2339.52
god to design and create all this

2338.4 --> 2341.28
yeah

2339.52 --> 2344.0
that's the problem

2341.28 --> 2346.96
it is unachievable yeah people have been

2344.0 --> 2349.68
trying for 200 years

2346.96 --> 2349.68
it didn't work

2349.92 --> 2354.8
it's undoable

2352.48 --> 2357.04
but people can be full to no end they

2354.8 --> 2359.119
can be driven to believe and keep

2357.04 --> 2361.92
themselves ignorant oh yeah

2359.119 --> 2363.839
oh yeah they could do that yeah they

2361.92 --> 2366.079
can't do

2363.839 --> 2369.839
is prove

2366.079 --> 2369.8390000000004
that there is no god

2370.8 --> 2376.2400000000002
we can prove there is god it's an

2373.359 --> 2379.119
ontological primitive there is no way to

2376.24 --> 2383.9199999999996
conceive of existence

2379.119 --> 2383.92
without god to design it first

2384.24 --> 2389.68
there is no way

2386.16 --> 2392.24
there will not be a way

2389.68 --> 2393.2799999999997
only within fantasy and willing

2392.24 --> 2394.8799999999997
ignorance

2393.28 --> 2397.8390000000004
is there a way

2394.88 --> 2397.839
and it never works

2408.64 --> 2415.359
you are indoctrinated by the reason

2410.8 --> 2415.3590000000004
jesus christ sorry dude are you like 12

2416.0 --> 2418.319
i mean

2419.68 --> 2425.9199999999996
what's coming out of you is so weak like

2422.24 --> 2427.52
i i'm almost afraid to start bashing you

2425.92 --> 2428.7200000000003
in a feel at this point like you might

2427.52 --> 2430.96
be like this

2428.72 --> 2433.9199999999996
handicapped person in a wheelchair or

2430.96 --> 2435.76
something that

2433.92 --> 2437.359
yeah you're gonna be pissed off if

2435.76 --> 2441.44
that's the case right it's like what the

2437.359 --> 2441.44
[ __ ] god why you do this

2441.68 --> 2446.48
well

2443.599 --> 2446.48
it's a challenge

2447.2 --> 2449.9199999999996
it's a challenge

2450.4 --> 2453.2000000000003
yeah

2451.44 --> 2455.04
challenges really are the only thing

2453.2 --> 2458.0
that are worth

2455.04 --> 2458.0
existing for

2458.16 --> 2463.359
so just think of how deep the challenge

2460.96 --> 2464.56
is presented to you

2463.359 --> 2467.839
how

2464.56 --> 2469.7599999999998
much you could get out of overcoming it

2467.839 --> 2471.04
right because there's nothing more

2469.76 --> 2472.4
powerful

2471.04 --> 2475.119
than a guy

2472.4 --> 2476.88
that's like truly overcome their

2475.119 --> 2478.8
handicap not by

2476.88 --> 2480.6400000000003
negating it

2478.8 --> 2482.079
or ignoring it

2480.64 --> 2485.5989999999997
but by

2482.079 --> 2488.88
empowering every other part

2485.599 --> 2491.92
and just having a full-blown complete

2488.88 --> 2495.44
strategy to compensate for it

2491.92 --> 2498.079
and even ascend beyond it yeah you can

2495.44 --> 2500.2400000000002
do that every person can potentially do

2498.079 --> 2502.7200000000003
that whether you're dumb or you're

2500.24 --> 2505.9199999999996
physically handicapped it doesn't matter

2502.72 --> 2508.0
it's only about the will and about

2505.92 --> 2509.839
the realization of what is true what

2508.0 --> 2512.16
isn't true god

2509.839 --> 2515.359
satan lies truth

2512.16 --> 2517.5989999999997
and then the decision and you can

2515.359 --> 2518.4
like even a person that's a bit like

2517.599 --> 2521.119
this

2518.4 --> 2524.079
it sucks i get it it sucks

2521.119 --> 2525.599
but that stress

2524.079 --> 2528.4
every stress

2525.599 --> 2530.6400000000003
of your situation of when you face the

2528.4 --> 2533.52
reality you can

2530.64 --> 2535.839
do something with that that it will be

2533.52 --> 2537.68
creative it doesn't always have to be

2535.839 --> 2538.48
destructive

2537.68 --> 2540.24
right

2538.48 --> 2543.44
force yourself

2540.24 --> 2545.2799999999997
to figure out how to transform it inside

2543.44 --> 2547.2000000000003
of yourself

2545.28 --> 2550.5600000000004
and turn it into

2547.2 --> 2552.8799999999997
a driving pulse

2550.56 --> 2555.04
that you can at least use to inspire

2552.88 --> 2557.44
others with and i've seen

2555.04 --> 2559.2799999999997
even like handicapped people do that

2557.44 --> 2560.56
that were seriously handicapped and they

2559.28 --> 2563.3590000000004
would still

2560.56 --> 2566.0
be like obsessed with entertaining

2563.359 --> 2567.92
people with just seeing funny or

2566.0 --> 2569.92
something right and they they were gone

2567.92 --> 2572.4
but they had a purpose

2569.92 --> 2574.96
they found a purpose within their mighty

2572.4 --> 2575.839
limitation and yes it's

2574.96 --> 2577.839
still

2575.839 --> 2581.44
like tragic and all that but if you're

2577.839 --> 2583.52
just honest about it they're still them

2581.44 --> 2585.92
and they've

2583.52 --> 2587.839
you could just be there like oh i'm just

2585.92 --> 2588.88
useless and crippled or you could just

2587.839 --> 2591.839
like

2588.88 --> 2593.119
i can be a weirdo and it can be funny to

2591.839 --> 2595.599
people

2593.119 --> 2599.28
it's all about what you do with what

2595.599 --> 2599.28
you've been given the challenge

2605.44 --> 2609.92
there's oh my god look at this

2608.079 --> 2612.319
dude [ __ ] off

2609.92 --> 2615.2000000000003
can't believe i got so serious you're

2612.319 --> 2615.2
just a numpty

2615.76 --> 2619.0400000000004
all right you're seriously

2619.359 --> 2627.7599999999998
you did you ever overcome your handicap

2623.92 --> 2630.079
i don't think so oh really

2627.76 --> 2632.5600000000004
you're simply repelling people oh yes i

2630.079 --> 2635.52
did not overcome my handicap

2632.56 --> 2637.92
of basically

2635.52 --> 2640.72
not knowing really how to communicate

2637.92 --> 2644.48
with people at all

2640.72 --> 2647.1189999999997
of severe anxiety and depression facing

2644.48 --> 2649.599
the world of actually getting stuck in

2647.119 --> 2651.44
the reversed world mindset

2649.599 --> 2652.88
because i was just feeling so

2651.44 --> 2655.28
demoralized

2652.88 --> 2657.44
and i turned out to be good at it almost

2655.28 --> 2660.48
like did really

2657.44 --> 2662.8
really big damage because of that

2660.48 --> 2665.119
and then still pulling out and turning

2662.8 --> 2668.1600000000003
it all inside out

2665.119 --> 2671.2000000000003
oh no i've never done nothing with my

2668.16 --> 2672.7999999999997
handicaps no of course i mean i'm only

2671.2 --> 2676.359
an empath that's

2672.8 --> 2676.3590000000004
super sensitive

2676.48 --> 2680.16
mastering psychology

2680.56 --> 2685.68
to a spiritual degree

2682.8 --> 2689.04
i mean i've done nothing nothing i've

2685.68 --> 2693.1189999999997
learned nothing i'm just agitating

2689.04 --> 2693.119
people oh i'm so destructive

2693.68 --> 2696.0789999999997
[ __ ]

2703.68 --> 2708.0789999999997
well he's not here is he thrown out yeah

2706.0 --> 2711.04
that's right after that point it's just

2708.079 --> 2711.04
like that's

2712.319 --> 2717.7599999999998
that's a combination probably of

2715.359 --> 2720.16
true ignorance not understanding what

2717.76 --> 2723.119
the hell i even do here and like the

2720.16 --> 2724.3999999999996
level of what i'm talking about

2723.119 --> 2726.48
oh god i

2724.4 --> 2729.48
lost my point at least i don't feel sick

2726.48 --> 2729.48
anymore

2733.119 --> 2737.52
amazing plato lasted

2736.16 --> 2740.56
i guess so

2737.52 --> 2743.52
but he was just being a gamma piece of

2740.56 --> 2747.68
[ __ ] now and like blind

2743.52 --> 2750.4
absolutely blind i was literally

2747.68 --> 2752.64
trying to encourage

2750.4 --> 2752.64
like

2753.52 --> 2760.68
he doesn't know what he's doing

2756.319 --> 2760.68
he doesn't know what he's doing

2762.48 --> 2768.92
what he's accusing me of i did exactly

2765.04 --> 2768.92
the opposite instantaneously

2769.68 --> 2774.0789999999997
and he couldn't even see it

2772.079 --> 2776.88
it's

2774.079 --> 2776.88
it's pathetic

2777.359 --> 2780.16
and didn't want to see it right he

2778.8 --> 2782.6400000000003
didn't want to listen he didn't want to

2780.16 --> 2784.3999999999996
learn he just wants me to shut up that's

2782.64 --> 2785.68
what happens right that's what happens

2784.4 --> 2786.8
when you're

2785.68 --> 2788.8799999999997
weak

2786.8 --> 2790.7200000000003
you're a coward

2788.88 --> 2793.92
you can't face

2790.72 --> 2795.1189999999997
the light of god which is truth

2793.92 --> 2796.64
something

2795.119 --> 2799.839
that

2796.64 --> 2801.839
seems to break the energy

2799.839 --> 2803.599
when you think about your model or

2801.839 --> 2806.0
whatever right

2803.599 --> 2808.6400000000003
you don't face it so oh then you're then

2806.0 --> 2812.079
oh i'm gonna put that aside and bring

2808.64 --> 2814.96
out my little demon liar piece of [ __ ]

2812.079 --> 2818.0
that can just do whatever they want

2814.96 --> 2820.96
to any degree without any consequences

2818.0 --> 2823.44
or considerations

2820.96 --> 2826.4
and you think that that's good

2823.44 --> 2829.52
that's insane

2826.4 --> 2831.839
that's a lack of humility

2829.52 --> 2834.16
and

2831.839 --> 2834.16
again

2834.88 --> 2839.119
belligerent

2837.04 --> 2841.2
it's a lack of humility and it's

2839.119 --> 2845.6400000000003
belligerent

2841.2 --> 2849.7599999999998
and the only proper response is deep

2845.64 --> 2851.2799999999997
confrontational humiliation

2849.76 --> 2854.28
that's where we get the title of the

2851.28 --> 2854.28
show

2867.2 --> 2870.5589999999997
all right gorgeous see you later

2871.599 --> 2876.96
i got a new troll yeah but

2874.48 --> 2879.44
there it just seems like it was like it

2876.96 --> 2880.48
could be like 12 or 14 or something i

2879.44 --> 2882.64
don't know

2880.48 --> 2885.28
i mean you got to realize there are

2882.64 --> 2886.96
going to be like 12 year olds that can

2885.28 --> 2888.559
technically just

2886.96 --> 2890.079
get on my show

2888.559 --> 2892.8
in my chat

2890.079 --> 2892.8
and that's okay

2893.839 --> 2900.7599999999998
just gonna realize this is like

2896.24 --> 2900.7599999999998
it can get pretty rough here

2903.68 --> 2908.0
so yeah if you want to be like young and

2905.76 --> 2909.76
get in here and get involved you got to

2908.0 --> 2911.839
have some balls and you got to have

2909.76 --> 2915.8390000000004
stamina

2911.839 --> 2915.839
and a plan right

2916.24 --> 2920.64
plan for yourself like what are you

2917.76 --> 2920.6400000000003
gonna get out of this

2920.72 --> 2924.72
how are you gonna

2922.48 --> 2929.04
learn about all these things get a feel

2924.72 --> 2931.7599999999998
for them and then use them in your life

2929.04 --> 2933.7599999999998
you realize that

2931.76 --> 2936.1600000000003
the wiser and smarter you are especially

2933.76 --> 2938.48
very young you're gonna get isolated

2936.16 --> 2941.359
because you you're going to be tested

2938.48 --> 2942.72
constantly by people that test you and

2941.359 --> 2944.88
your resolve

2942.72 --> 2947.4399999999996
and your methods

2944.88 --> 2949.599
it's it's happening everywhere like for

2947.44 --> 2953.28
example the whole rockfin

2949.599 --> 2956.319
situation with owen benjamin is like a a

2953.28 --> 2959.28
very direct example of that effect it

2956.319 --> 2962.0
happens constantly

2959.28 --> 2962.0
everywhere

2962.319 --> 2966.24
if you're going to be a better person

2964.4 --> 2969.52
you're going to face that sort of a

2966.24 --> 2972.0789999999997
thing you got to realize that you got to

2969.52 --> 2974.079
take the responsibility

2972.079 --> 2975.44
take the weight of that

2974.079 --> 2978.0
and

2975.44 --> 2978.0
grind it

2978.079 --> 2985.0
get good at it

2979.839 --> 2985.0
build the muscles to carry it right

2993.68 --> 3001.04
he has fe videos going back a year okay

2998.8 --> 3003.6800000000003
i don't even know what his point was he

3001.04 --> 3007.04
was just being well like the rockfin guy

3003.68 --> 3009.7599999999998
just a gamma squirt boy

3007.04 --> 3011.52
but not super grossly it didn't seem

3009.76 --> 3014.0
like like

3011.52 --> 3016.24
really seething gamma it's just but it

3014.0 --> 3017.44
was effectively that sort of behavior

3016.24 --> 3018.8799999999997
and

3017.44 --> 3021.04
yeah

3018.88 --> 3024.7200000000003
when i literally address every

3021.04 --> 3026.72
accusation in great detail immediately

3024.72 --> 3029.359
and then you still keep going throwing

3026.72 --> 3031.1189999999997
out [ __ ] yeah i gotta ban you then

3029.359 --> 3033.7599999999998
right

3031.119 --> 3036.559
i'm effectively being incredibly

3033.76 --> 3036.559
apologetic

3039.52 --> 3044.0
if you don't then

3041.52 --> 3046.16
stand down from that

3044.0 --> 3047.92
get your bearings get to your senses

3046.16 --> 3052.04
then i have to kick you out because

3047.92 --> 3052.04
you're literally being hysterical

3054.319 --> 3059.44
and i am do partially doing that to

3057.119 --> 3062.7200000000003
protect yourself from humiliating

3059.44 --> 3062.7200000000003
yourself even further

3067.359 --> 3072.24
right and hey you can still make your

3069.92 --> 3074.7200000000003
own videos you know make your anti-arwen

3072.24 --> 3075.7599999999998
videos make it make your case man build

3074.72 --> 3077.7599999999998
a

3075.76 --> 3080.88
dude get some lawyers in there and just

3077.76 --> 3083.44
like really put down the story make it

3080.88 --> 3084.7200000000003
extra threatening oh what could you do

3083.44 --> 3086.559
oh you have to

3084.72 --> 3089.04
do all you can

3086.559 --> 3091.76
right i can't stop that i won't stop

3089.04 --> 3095.04
that like i won't even like

3091.76 --> 3098.96
do anything against that

3095.04 --> 3100.48
unless you start doing that in my chat

3098.96 --> 3102.48
that i use

3100.48 --> 3105.44
for my live show

3102.48 --> 3109.28
directly a direct source

3105.44 --> 3112.4
of my productivity for my show you see

3109.28 --> 3114.96
you're literally on my work floor

3112.4 --> 3118.96
when you get in the chat right

3114.96 --> 3118.96
it's not a public space

3119.52 --> 3123.119
where everybody can just do whatever the

3121.44 --> 3125.04
[ __ ] they want and say whatever the [ __ ]

3123.119 --> 3126.0
they were it's not a public place you

3125.04 --> 3129.359
see

3126.0 --> 3129.359
it's my work floor

3136.88 --> 3139.839
anyway

3140.87 --> 3144.79
[Music]

3148.84 --> 3156.23
[Music]

3161.52 --> 3167.599
wow look at this squirt boys today

3164.88 --> 3170.6400000000003
some real gammas

3167.599 --> 3172.6400000000003
rolling in today

3170.64 --> 3176.0
wonder where they're coming from

3172.64 --> 3177.1189999999997
maybe these are like the ken wheeler

3176.0 --> 3181.559
bobbity

3177.119 --> 3181.559
gammas could it be

3194.64 --> 3198.96
are you ethereans

3197.119 --> 3202.8
like why are you here why are you here

3198.96 --> 3202.8
in chat doing that

3204.64 --> 3208.92
trying to dis at me exactly

3214.8 --> 3220.6400000000003
everything is a conspiracy

3218.48 --> 3223.28
very often my assessment of people no

3220.64 --> 3224.96
i'm not

3223.28 --> 3226.88
if i'm going to be often in my

3224.96 --> 3229.76
assessment then

3226.88 --> 3232.6400000000003
hey anybody that i actually trust which

3229.76 --> 3235.44
would be a person with a wrench

3232.64 --> 3238.64
tell me tell me when you think i might

3235.44 --> 3240.16
be off right i'm okay with that

3238.64 --> 3242.4
i don't think you're a gamma if you're

3240.16 --> 3244.48
going to be like uh well maybe this and

3242.4 --> 3246.8
that right maybe you're not having all

3244.48 --> 3248.319
the data maybe you got detailed data

3246.8 --> 3251.119
that would change things i'd like to

3248.319 --> 3253.2799999999997
know about that the guys in fed do that

3251.119 --> 3255.52
all the time

3253.28 --> 3258.0
correcting each other even like even if

3255.52 --> 3261.44
it seems a bit nitpicky why

3258.0 --> 3265.04
because getting it right is important

3261.44 --> 3267.839
so i'm fully okay with that but not if

3265.04 --> 3270.079
some random guy that just shows up in my

3267.839 --> 3271.2
chat for the first time says it though

3270.079 --> 3276.8390000000004
huh

3271.2 --> 3276.839
cause they're usually gaslighting liars

3286.72 --> 3290.839
unemployed i'm not unemployed see here

3289.839 --> 3292.799
they come

3290.839 --> 3294.64
liar

3292.799 --> 3296.559
liar

3294.64 --> 3300.16
not unemployed

3296.559 --> 3301.599
officially employed

3300.16 --> 3304.0789999999997
yeah

3301.599 --> 3307.599
this is my job

3304.079 --> 3311.119
my chat is my work floor

3307.599 --> 3313.28
yeah not unemployed

3311.119 --> 3315.119
and i'm not a mystic you see you don't

3313.28 --> 3318.079
understand what a mystic is you're

3315.119 --> 3319.28
calling me a mystic

3318.079 --> 3322.6400000000003
that

3319.28 --> 3324.96
is almost a choice that proves to me

3322.64 --> 3326.5589999999997
that you just don't understand what the

3324.96 --> 3329.839
[ __ ] i'm talking about you don't have

3326.559 --> 3333.119
the faculties for fractal thinking

3329.839 --> 3335.2799999999997
for deeper introspective psychology you

3333.119 --> 3337.839
probably have a lot of trouble actually

3335.28 --> 3340.079
looking inside and seeing what you are

3337.839 --> 3343.2
is it is what you are is that something

3340.079 --> 3344.2400000000002
you like no oh no you don't look then

3343.2 --> 3346.799
you just

3344.24 --> 3348.799
lay the responsibility of what you are

3346.799 --> 3350.4
down on the world they're gonna have to

3348.799 --> 3352.0
deal with it yeah you're not dealing

3350.4 --> 3353.6800000000003
with that yeah

3352.0 --> 3355.839
i've seen that there's a lot of people

3353.68 --> 3357.7599999999998
that do that they're usually [ __ ]

3355.839 --> 3359.839
annoying

3357.76 --> 3360.8390000000004
and not somebody i'd like to associate

3359.839 --> 3363.599
with

3360.839 --> 3365.2
yeah but to a person like that yeah i

3363.599 --> 3367.04
might be a mystic

3365.2 --> 3368.96
because they don't understand what i'm

3367.04 --> 3370.48
talking about because they never do it

3368.96 --> 3372.799
they never tried

3370.48 --> 3374.96
so it's a mystery to them so you might

3372.799 --> 3377.599
see me as a mystic but i'm not a mystic

3374.96 --> 3380.4
you see a real mystic

3377.599 --> 3383.2000000000003
keeps mysteries

3380.4 --> 3387.52
and then keeps people bound with their

3383.2 --> 3390.64
curiosity to those mysteries a mystery

3387.52 --> 3393.92
to a mystic is like a carrot on a stick

3390.64 --> 3396.0789999999997
it's the ultimate mystery that's that

3393.92 --> 3398.319
might be revealed but it won't be

3396.079 --> 3401.44
revealed and it'll keep you it's the

3398.319 --> 3402.319
cliffhanger in a in a in a series

3401.44 --> 3404.16
yeah

3402.319 --> 3407.52
that's what a mystic does i'm not a

3404.16 --> 3410.16
mystic i'm exactly the opposite

3407.52 --> 3411.839
i lit i

3410.16 --> 3413.92
i'm toto

3411.839 --> 3415.7599999999998
i'm the dog i pull the curtain away

3413.92 --> 3418.16
immediately like

3415.76 --> 3420.3190000000004
bang straight in your face in a way

3418.16 --> 3422.24
that's not just like oh look at me i'm

3420.319 --> 3425.359
so confrontational but no just like

3422.24 --> 3427.68
really actually

3425.359 --> 3430.24
the light

3427.68 --> 3432.3999999999996
right through you

3430.24 --> 3434.24
that's what i do that's not a mystic

3432.4 --> 3436.64
it's a revealer it's exactly the

3434.24 --> 3438.0
opposite of a mystic

3436.64 --> 3441.359
mystics

3438.0 --> 3444.88
are techno babbling wizards

3441.359 --> 3446.799
they're illusionists i'm a diviner it's

3444.88 --> 3447.839
a still wizardry

3446.799 --> 3450.48
but it's a

3447.839 --> 3452.4
very different opposite nature of

3450.48 --> 3453.2
illusion

3452.4 --> 3455.92
yeah

3453.2 --> 3458.839
divining getting to the core of it to

3455.92 --> 3463.28
the esoteric so the actual

3458.839 --> 3466.48
structure of the fabric of existence

3463.28 --> 3469.119
including the things that are

3466.48 --> 3471.839
kind of outside of the norm but that are

3469.119 --> 3474.559
in development like spirit mechanics the

3471.839 --> 3476.4
energy of spirit the recognition of

3474.559 --> 3479.119
consciousness

3476.4 --> 3481.119
as a separate thing as knowledge as a

3479.119 --> 3484.2400000000002
substance even through scientific

3481.119 --> 3487.6800000000003
experimentation yeah

3484.24 --> 3491.7599999999998
that's exactly the opposite of a mystic

3487.68 --> 3494.0
i'm a diviner an oracle if you will

3491.76 --> 3496.079
but you don't even understand those

3494.0 --> 3499.68
words because you only ever heard them

3496.079 --> 3502.2400000000002
in stupid dumbass video games that's the

3499.68 --> 3504.48
only way you even heard of any of those

3502.24 --> 3507.04
words isn't it yeah

3504.48 --> 3510.079
cause you never actually tried to look

3507.04 --> 3514.4
beyond just stupid

3510.079 --> 3514.4
cookie cutter entertainment for you

3515.119 --> 3519.52
you never actually thought to look like

3516.96 --> 3522.799
hey where did they get those ideas what

3519.52 --> 3524.64
is this what is this thing supposedly

3522.799 --> 3526.72
you did you know you're not interested

3524.64 --> 3529.2
right you're just like oh i recognize

3526.72 --> 3531.04
the words i'm not really interested

3529.2 --> 3533.1189999999997
yeah well then everything becomes a

3531.04 --> 3535.92
mystic to you

3533.119 --> 3538.48
but i'm not i'm a diviner

3535.92 --> 3541.04
that's my discipline

3538.48 --> 3543.2
i divine things i'm really [ __ ] good

3541.04 --> 3545.92
at it i'm not the only one

3543.2 --> 3549.2799999999997
but it is like one of my primary focuses

3545.92 --> 3552.64
and it makes me an oracle

3549.28 --> 3555.2000000000003
not a mystic yeah see how

3552.64 --> 3556.5589999999997
how insulted i was by somebody that

3555.2 --> 3558.96
doesn't even know what the [ __ ] he's

3556.559 --> 3561.52
talking about accusing me of that

3558.96 --> 3564.64
because it means something very specific

3561.52 --> 3567.599
to me because i understand these things

3564.64 --> 3573.0789999999997
and then it's not just a random

3567.599 --> 3573.079
word it's suddenly a very specific word

3578.48 --> 3585.2
dude what the [ __ ]

3580.48 --> 3585.2
get out of here you spamming gamma

3585.44 --> 3589.799

3664.319 --> 3669.2
to to troll me like this

3667.04 --> 3672.24

3673.52 --> 3679.599
you couldn't even find somebody with

3675.599 --> 3680.6400000000003
like a higher than 120 iq for this

3679.599 --> 3683.2000000000003
right

3680.64 --> 3685.7599999999998
actual trolling

3683.2 --> 3687.1189999999997
that that can actually alter somebody's

3685.76 --> 3690.96
behavior

3687.119 --> 3693.359
right no you you you got the dumbass

3690.96 --> 3693.359
thanks

3693.599 --> 3699.599
just goes to show like wow

3697.44 --> 3701.599
you're kind of [ __ ] so that means

3699.599 --> 3703.52
that the people that are opposing me are

3701.599 --> 3706.079
[ __ ] then

3703.52 --> 3707.52
if we don't get like more serious

3706.079 --> 3709.3590000000004
confronting

3707.52 --> 3713.319
opposition

3709.359 --> 3713.319
this is so pathetic

3724.559 --> 3727.559
dude

3749.76 --> 3752.76
wow

3756.319 --> 3760.64
it's pathetic

3758.4 --> 3762.079
you can't make your retardation rub off

3760.64 --> 3765.359
on me it's not

3762.079 --> 3766.6400000000003
don't you see that i'm just going to

3765.359 --> 3770.5589999999997
basically

3766.64 --> 3772.24
attack you with being smarter

3770.559 --> 3775.52
don't you understand

3772.24 --> 3777.52
it's not going to make me decrease

3775.52 --> 3779.839
what i do

3777.52 --> 3782.0
you could i could actually state at this

3779.839 --> 3785.2
point that because

3782.0 --> 3787.52
this ass clown came in my chat and start

3785.2 --> 3791.0389999999998
basically ruined the conversation that i

3787.52 --> 3792.559
feel better now i i do i literally feel

3791.039 --> 3793.92
better now

3792.559 --> 3796.7200000000003
thank you

3793.92 --> 3798.64
thank you

3796.72 --> 3803.2
for i guess

3798.64 --> 3805.68
humiliating yourself in my chat

3803.2 --> 3808.64
and giving me a good excuse to basically

3805.68 --> 3811.0389999999998
dump all that energy that i can do

3808.64 --> 3813.68
anything with unto you

3811.039 --> 3816.2400000000002
you deserve it

3813.68 --> 3816.24
enjoy

3822.64 --> 3826.96
bats

3823.52 --> 3826.96
pair of socks on the way yeah

3828.559 --> 3834.0
but yeah i'm gonna run out in like 15

3831.28 --> 3834.0
minutes anyway

3834.4 --> 3838.2400000000002
i think

3835.92 --> 3841.2400000000002
i hope i'm not seeing any links from

3838.24 --> 3841.24
nathan

3850.09 --> 3853.219
[Music]

3856.72 --> 3863.31
[Music]

3864.96 --> 3867.839
uh

3890.799 --> 3897.359
it's i'm still insulted by the way for

3893.28 --> 3901.92
being called a mystic like that's

3897.359 --> 3906.319
that is like an actual insult to me

3901.92 --> 3906.319
because i'm exactly the opposite of that

3906.72 --> 3909.839
i avoid mysticism

3912.799 --> 3916.319
ah

3913.76 --> 3916.3190000000004
there it is

3919.359 --> 3924.319
okay there is a live show thank god in

3922.319 --> 3926.319
15 minutes

3924.319 --> 3928.5589999999997
thank god but i'm i'm kind of happy

3926.319 --> 3928.5589999999997
though

3930.64 --> 3935.0389999999998
doesn't necessarily yeah i'm not that

3932.24 --> 3937.2
relieved but

3935.039 --> 3940.6400000000003
it's not flat oh

3937.2 --> 3941.359
yes i mean that works every time you do

3940.64 --> 3942.799
it

3941.359 --> 3946.0
i mean

3942.799 --> 3949.44
cap's titles

3946.0 --> 3952.079
of something it like your name is

3949.44 --> 3955.119
directly opposing us and then just being

3952.079 --> 3957.92
polite in the chat that works so well

3955.119 --> 3959.359
every time of the last 50 times you

3957.92 --> 3960.7200000000003
tried that

3959.359 --> 3962.96
ass

3960.72 --> 3966.799
i mean how many times are you gonna try

3962.96 --> 3968.16
that i am just going to delete it every

3966.799 --> 3970.319
time

3968.16 --> 3972.48
it's never going to be

3970.319 --> 3975.2799999999997
just left there you see

3972.48 --> 3979.839
i i understand what that is i understand

3975.28 --> 3979.8390000000004
your frequency it doesn't help you

3980.24 --> 3986.319
you're just a spam bot to me

3984.079 --> 3989.119
you're not going to sneak your way in

3986.319 --> 3990.5589999999997
don't you get it it's never

3989.119 --> 3993.559
going to

3990.559 --> 3993.559
work

4001.28 --> 4005.92
what is my definition i'm not gonna say

4003.28 --> 4010.0
that all again logical conclusion i just

4005.92 --> 4010.0
explained it like 10 minutes ago

4014.079 --> 4017.599
and

4014.88 --> 4020.48
i'll explain it again whatever

4017.599 --> 4023.3590000000004
mystic is about a mystery

4020.48 --> 4025.44
and being the controller of a mystery a

4023.359 --> 4028.72
mystic

4025.44 --> 4031.599
is a priest that knows something

4028.72 --> 4035.0389999999998
that might be really important

4031.599 --> 4037.2000000000003
and he will tell about the mystery

4035.039 --> 4038.559
but you can never

4037.2 --> 4040.319
find out

4038.559 --> 4041.92
you can never have a look

4040.319 --> 4044.4
for yourself

4041.92 --> 4046.96
you can only hear them out

4044.4 --> 4048.88
about it

4046.96 --> 4051.28
right

4048.88 --> 4053.119
they don't give you a chance to

4051.28 --> 4055.44
basically attain

4053.119 --> 4057.76
the truth about the mystery

4055.44 --> 4059.68
and if you do then they will probably

4057.76 --> 4060.4
like hunt you down

4059.68 --> 4062.799
like

4060.4 --> 4066.0
old priesthood mystics

4062.799 --> 4068.16
yeah if you figured out their big secret

4066.0 --> 4070.64
they'd have to kill you

4068.16 --> 4072.72
because everything rested on that

4070.64 --> 4075.68
right or they'd have to like drop their

4072.72 --> 4078.0
entire act like go away somewhere else

4075.68 --> 4080.5589999999997
and try a new

4078.0 --> 4082.72
mystery

4080.559 --> 4084.079
it's a wizardry thing

4082.72 --> 4085.9199999999996
yeah

4084.079 --> 4088.1600000000003
i'm a diviner

4085.92 --> 4091.839
it's the opposite

4088.16 --> 4095.44
i divine information figuring it out

4091.839 --> 4097.68
getting insights that

4095.44 --> 4097.68
yeah

4098.64 --> 4102.08
it's the opposite it's

4100.08 --> 4104.3189999999995
revealing things so constantly like

4102.08 --> 4107.199
somebody says something then i will take

4104.319 --> 4110.64
that something and then show you some

4107.199 --> 4110.639999999999
show the person that said that

4111.199 --> 4115.839
give them an image to reflect upon

4113.199 --> 4118.159
personally that will reveal

4115.839 --> 4119.6
more about what they said or even who

4118.159 --> 4121.759
they are

4119.6 --> 4124.2390000000005
then they would have figured out just by

4121.759 --> 4126.159
themselves thinking about what they said

4124.239 --> 4128.239
yeah that's what a diviner that's what

4126.159 --> 4131.5199999999995
an oracle does is what i do

4128.239 --> 4134.879999999999
it's exactly the opposite of a mystic

4131.52 --> 4137.679
i'm constantly directly revealing things

4134.88 --> 4139.839
mechanics constantly giving you like

4137.679 --> 4142.0
high level tools hoping that you'll be

4139.839 --> 4143.5199999999995
able to grasp it

4142.0 --> 4147.839
constantly

4143.52 --> 4147.839000000001
is exactly the opposite of a mystic

4147.92 --> 4153.4400000000005
mystic only gives you cliff hangers

4151.12 --> 4155.2789999999995
only gives you longing for wanting to

4153.44 --> 4160.12
know more

4155.279 --> 4160.120000000001
if you longing for entertainment

4160.96 --> 4165.44
that's what a mystic does

4163.279 --> 4168.56
i do the opposite

4165.44 --> 4170.719
i like to tell a good story

4168.56 --> 4170.719
but

4171.92 --> 4177.1990000000005
as you all know

4173.6 --> 4179.120000000001
when i have like complicated monologue

4177.199 --> 4181.04
or spirit mechanics or something deep

4179.12 --> 4183.199
then i know you're gonna reflect upon it

4181.04 --> 4184.96
and then i still will eventually snap

4183.199 --> 4187.599999999999
you out of it i'll be like hey hello are

4184.96 --> 4187.6
you still there

4187.679 --> 4192.2390000000005
because i'm not a mystic i'm not just

4190.239 --> 4194.08
going to keep on rambling and rambling

4192.239 --> 4196.5599999999995
and rambling and rambling and rambling

4194.08 --> 4198.719
or rambling non-stop not listening to

4196.56 --> 4200.56
what it's doing

4198.719 --> 4202.88
to so that everybody can tune in and be

4200.56 --> 4202.88
all like

4204.4 --> 4208.08
yeah

4205.28 --> 4210.8
that's what a mystic would do

4208.08 --> 4214.48
that's not what i do

4210.8 --> 4216.400000000001
i want the interaction i want your ideas

4214.48 --> 4218.239
and then i instantly

4216.4 --> 4220.08
transform them

4218.239 --> 4222.718999999999
give you something back

4220.08 --> 4224.64
and sometimes some of you do the same

4222.719 --> 4226.96
for me

4224.64 --> 4229.4400000000005
i certainly hope you will because that's

4226.96 --> 4231.84
the skill i'm trying to also

4229.44 --> 4234.879999999999
teach you

4231.84 --> 4234.88
if you have that in you

4240.88 --> 4245.679
yeah that's right pjc thank you for

4243.28 --> 4247.36
recognizing that yes many definitions

4245.679 --> 4250.64
there is right

4247.36 --> 4253.36
it's like these are all contemporary

4250.64 --> 4255.1990000000005
meanings like specifically call the

4253.36 --> 4257.04
mystic in that

4255.199 --> 4258.5599999999995
piece of history in that country and

4257.04 --> 4260.64
that individual

4258.56 --> 4261.52
and then it's like ooh defines like this

4260.64 --> 4264.08
but

4261.52 --> 4268.159000000001
i always go right to the word to what

4264.08 --> 4269.36
does the word actually say right

4268.159 --> 4272.159
if

4269.36 --> 4275.5199999999995
if the meaning of something becomes too

4272.159 --> 4277.36
broad too many different angles of

4275.52 --> 4278.64
approach that start contradicting one

4277.36 --> 4282.08
another

4278.64 --> 4284.159000000001
go back to the roots what does it mean

4282.08 --> 4286.32
and then if you do figure that out if

4284.159 --> 4288.159
you look at the etymology

4286.32 --> 4289.759999999999
the actual word

4288.159 --> 4293.159
then you can too

4289.76 --> 4296.2390000000005
use that knowledge reflect back upon the

4293.159 --> 4298.08
contemporary meanings throughout history

4296.239 --> 4301.36
also associated with it and then

4298.08 --> 4304.48
establish to yourself how they were

4301.36 --> 4304.48
using that word

4305.44 --> 4307.678999999999
see

4307.84 --> 4312.88
so

4308.8 --> 4315.6
the true core of the word is always more

4312.88 --> 4318.64
important than some

4315.6 --> 4320.64
notation of a contemporary application

4318.64 --> 4325.4400000000005
of the word somewhere

4320.64 --> 4328.88
right etymology is always more important

4325.44 --> 4331.389999999999
unmystify i like that adam rice

4328.88 --> 4334.549
thank you for that

4331.39 --> 4334.549
[Music]

4334.56 --> 4343.84
a steam of uh getting sick

4338.76 --> 4343.84
[Music]

4346.4 --> 4352.239
the generally accepted term

4349.36 --> 4355.599999999999
really the generally accepted so what is

4352.239 --> 4359.28
the generally accepted term for mystic

4355.6 --> 4359.280000000001
logical conclusion you tell me

4364.0 --> 4368.64
is that just a defogger

4366.32 --> 4368.639999999999
right

4368.88 --> 4371.84
well

4372.159 --> 4378.08
technically the opposite of a

4374.719 --> 4380.4
a mystic is a diviner this is what it is

4378.08 --> 4380.4
that's

4380.8 --> 4383.8
right

4386.0 --> 4391.6
mystic create a mystery

4388.56 --> 4393.360000000001
keep people held to that mystery

4391.6 --> 4398.159000000001
diviner

4393.36 --> 4400.4
i call it a divine yeah it's big death

4398.159 --> 4402.159
don't know maybe it's that the word that

4400.4 --> 4405.839999999999
i used to that's gonna change at some

4402.159 --> 4408.48
point but call it diviner is just

4405.84 --> 4410.84
using your ability to really get to the

4408.48 --> 4412.718999999999
root of something to figure it

4410.84 --> 4416.2390000000005
out and

4412.719 --> 4419.36
arguably using powers to do it right

4416.239 --> 4422.0
more than just standard reasoning

4419.36 --> 4422.0
disciplines

4422.56 --> 4427.360000000001
like actually using energy using even

4424.96 --> 4430.0
the emotion using

4427.36 --> 4432.239
all the cross-referencing of experiences

4430.0 --> 4435.04
in all directions in order to get a more

4432.239 --> 4435.04
complete picture

4436.239 --> 4439.239
divining

4442.4 --> 4446.639999999999
right and the problem is also that oh

4444.4 --> 4449.5199999999995
are you defining my thoughts right

4446.64 --> 4450.88
that's such a sentence

4449.52 --> 4452.64
why is that

4450.88 --> 4455.12
like

4452.64 --> 4458.56
an accusation

4455.12 --> 4460.88
right why is that bad well it's because

4458.56 --> 4462.88
the person is actually right you're

4460.88 --> 4465.12
talking to the person

4462.88 --> 4467.28
but you're like defining their thoughts

4465.12 --> 4468.8
in other words basically telling them

4467.28 --> 4470.0
what they're thinking

4468.8 --> 4472.0
even though

4470.0 --> 4474.96
the person right there

4472.0 --> 4476.56
might be like uh no

4474.96 --> 4479.92
that's not actually what i'm thinking

4476.56 --> 4479.92
you're technically incorrect

4481.12 --> 4485.76
right but that's when you try to divine

4484.0 --> 4488.88
somebody's thoughts

4485.76 --> 4492.96
i don't typically do that i try to avoid

4488.88 --> 4493.92
divining the actual thinking pattern

4492.96 --> 4496.159
when

4493.92 --> 4497.12
i'm directly like opposing somebody

4496.159 --> 4499.759999999999
that's

4497.12 --> 4501.84
it's bad news to do that sometimes i do

4499.76 --> 4504.719
it as like a hostile action because i'm

4501.84 --> 4506.96
like seriously pissed off with somebody

4504.719 --> 4508.8
and then i will do that then literally

4506.96 --> 4509.679
start digging into people's minds it's

4508.8 --> 4512.719
like

4509.679 --> 4515.36
offensive divining it's like yeah i can

4512.719 --> 4518.88
i literally am looking right inside of

4515.36 --> 4518.88
your head right now yeah

4519.04 --> 4521.5199999999995
like that

4521.92 --> 4528.08
but divining is basically using

4525.199 --> 4528.08
everything you got

4528.4 --> 4532.5199999999995
to figure out something

4539.44 --> 4542.44
uh

4566.48 --> 4572.919999999999
why would they do come here to say that

4568.96 --> 4572.92
because they have no life

4578.76 --> 4581.879
[Music]

4590.719 --> 4594.96
they're bored

4592.96 --> 4598.159
and they're too stubborn to do something

4594.96 --> 4598.159
productive with their time

4598.64 --> 4602.88
so

4599.92 --> 4606.56
nagging somebody that's smarter than you

4602.88 --> 4608.64
might give you a temporary impression

4606.56 --> 4610.719
like you're actually smart like the

4608.64 --> 4613.679
smart can rub off on you

4610.719 --> 4615.92
however since you're not actually paying

4613.679 --> 4617.4400000000005
attention and developing yourself as you

4615.92 --> 4619.4400000000005
do it

4617.44 --> 4620.4
you're not actually going to be smarter

4619.44 --> 4623.12
for it

4620.4 --> 4624.799999999999
you're just a troll [ __ ] that gets in

4623.12 --> 4626.88
the way

4624.8 --> 4629.52
and the only place where you think you

4626.88 --> 4630.8
might be smart for doing that is in your

4629.52 --> 4632.96
mind

4630.8 --> 4636.320000000001
because there will be no

4632.96 --> 4638.8
reflection within physical reality to

4636.32 --> 4640.48
prove that you're actually

4638.8 --> 4643.28
growing yourself that you're building

4640.48 --> 4646.159
something when you do that

4643.28 --> 4648.32
you're just wasting your time

4646.159 --> 4652.08
you're not wasting my time right because

4648.32 --> 4653.84
even as you attempt to waste my time

4652.08 --> 4656.0
i will use

4653.84 --> 4658.400000000001
you wasting your time

4656.0 --> 4662.4
to do something productive with my time

4658.4 --> 4664.48
even as you wasting yours yeah

4662.4 --> 4666.719
that's how i fanatical i can get with

4664.48 --> 4666.718999999999
that

4668.719 --> 4673.44
because everything can be productive it

4671.6 --> 4675.04
only requires

4673.44 --> 4678.08
the will

4675.04 --> 4679.6
the fanatical will to always do that no

4678.08 --> 4682.48
matter what you do

4679.6 --> 4684.8
you can potentially even troll and be

4682.48 --> 4688.32
productive and learn something from it

4684.8 --> 4690.8
some people do actually do that

4688.32 --> 4693.28
those are the more likeable trolls they

4690.8 --> 4695.1990000000005
actually smarten up over time they're

4693.28 --> 4697.36
not really trolls it's kind of trolls

4695.199 --> 4699.44
kind of their their gig

4697.36 --> 4701.44
the way they like to behave

4699.44 --> 4704.239
they're not really trolls right the

4701.44 --> 4705.12
actual trolls they don't grow they're

4704.239 --> 4707.839999999999
just

4705.12 --> 4707.84
[ __ ]

4708.48 --> 4712.799999999999
that are lazy

4711.36 --> 4714.88
and arrogant

4712.8 --> 4717.12
and they're wasting their own time

4714.88 --> 4718.2390000000005
and they don't want to actually learn

4717.12 --> 4720.0
anything

4718.239 --> 4721.678999999999
that's why they always stay the same

4720.0 --> 4723.76
that's why they never

4721.679 --> 4725.6
open their game that's why they don't

4723.76 --> 4728.08
become more creative that's why they

4725.6 --> 4730.2390000000005
stay [ __ ] because they're wasting

4728.08 --> 4732.4
their time they're not even learning

4730.239 --> 4734.639999999999
anything from wasting their time yeah

4732.4 --> 4737.759999999999
i've wasted a lot of my time in my life

4734.64 --> 4740.400000000001
guess what i learned from every freaking

4737.76 --> 4741.84
moment where i wasted my time

4740.4 --> 4744.32
you get it

4741.84 --> 4748.08
yeah sounds weird isn't it it sounds

4744.32 --> 4751.04
weird i know but i did

4748.08 --> 4752.8
things you don't even understand

4751.04 --> 4754.48
now that's me being a mystic for a

4752.8 --> 4756.96
second there

4754.48 --> 4758.959999999999
i i'm not sure i even understand i just

4756.96 --> 4761.44
know that i'm obsessed with it

4758.96 --> 4763.679
and that i've always found a way even

4761.44 --> 4765.44
when i thought i was wasting my time to

4763.679 --> 4767.4400000000005
actually still automatically do

4765.44 --> 4771.36
something productive and then my mind

4767.44 --> 4775.32
would catch on to that later

4771.36 --> 4775.32
it's just something that happens

4778.32 --> 4783.28
yeah how many of these trolls are gonna

4780.4 --> 4783.28
have these moments

4783.84 --> 4787.6
where they're like oh man i remember

4785.92 --> 4789.12
that time

4787.6 --> 4792.96
when i was there

4789.12 --> 4795.679
[ __ ] i've changed a lot since then

4792.96 --> 4798.2390000000005
yeah i certainly learned how to like

4795.679 --> 4801.92
refine my statements a bit more and i

4798.239 --> 4803.839999999999
really got to know this person better

4801.92 --> 4806.8
like how to actually effectively

4803.84 --> 4809.92
communicate with them now right oh wait

4806.8 --> 4814.96
no no your trolls and you're still

4809.92 --> 4814.96
talking exactly the same like years ago

4816.159 --> 4819.759999999999
yeah

4817.44 --> 4822.239
like a kubo virus here who never learns

4819.76 --> 4822.2390000000005
anything

4823.44 --> 4829.919999999999
oh the friendly troll that never

4826.08 --> 4835.44
