98.22 --> 104.06
of my show

100.86 --> 104.06
where is very different

104.52 --> 109.939
so it's big gray Haze out there right

107.759 --> 109.93900000000001
now

110.34 --> 116.7
oh uniform I can

112.74 --> 119.6
clouds the gray soup

116.7 --> 119.60000000000001
extremely moist

121.619 --> 124.759
bit more wind

125.1 --> 127.759
bill

129.539 --> 134.599
I don't even technically oh yeah I do

132.0 --> 134.599
know why I'm

139.56 --> 145.62
that's still doable but

142.98 --> 148.57999999999998
it's not really as warm

145.62 --> 148.58
check the temperature

148.8 --> 151.4
uh

155.22 --> 162.62
right it's 21 degrees oh 81 humidity

159.42 --> 162.61999999999998
that makes sense

162.739 --> 167.0
it's not really cold but

169.86 --> 174.54000000000002
doesn't really get the summer feeling I

172.62 --> 177.59900000000002
mean

174.54 --> 181.099
hey ajm good to see you

177.599 --> 181.099
first in chat

184.319 --> 187.159
how are you doing

192.36 --> 195.36
foreign

202.14 --> 208.33999999999997
Tuesday the 13th of July 2021

211.739 --> 214.879
our show today

218.879 --> 224.34
didn't watch yesterday's show back but I

222.54 --> 225.659
was really surprised by the amount of

224.34 --> 227.70000000000002
views I had

225.659 --> 231.0
was a lot

227.7 --> 233.57999999999998
hey rocket blimps

231.0 --> 237.299
but there's the same very muggy is that

233.58 --> 239.78
what you call it muggy weather hmm

237.299 --> 239.78
okay

240.72 --> 245.76
I mean the sound of the word seems kind

243.299 --> 247.31900000000002
of right just like icky what does that

245.76 --> 249.29899999999998
even mean

247.319 --> 252.01899999999998
but okay I guess you could call this

249.299 --> 252.019
muggy weather

257.579 --> 262.259
all right

259.62 --> 264.78000000000003
but I don't know if it was Nathan's

262.259 --> 267.06
little title card that he made for my

264.78 --> 269.34
show yesterday

267.06 --> 272.18
I refuse to [ __ ]

269.34 --> 276.23999999999995
apparently that was very

272.18 --> 281.84000000000003
clickbaity to a whole bunch of people

276.24 --> 281.84000000000003
because that stream got 334 views

283.5 --> 286.88
it's just like what

287.82 --> 291.259
within 24 hours

292.08 --> 296.09999999999997
that's new

293.699 --> 300.62
like most of my videos don't even get

296.1 --> 300.62
that amount of viewers after a week

302.639 --> 305.539
it was pretty weird

307.979 --> 312.08
and sticky not muggy okay

316.38 --> 320.36
right

317.82 --> 320.36
check

320.4 --> 325.58
commentary section it selected

330.539 --> 336.539
I did get a couple of Cups oh right also

333.0 --> 338.82
Mind Of God yesterday in chat

336.539 --> 341.21999999999997
yeah

338.82 --> 342.3
what's this minor God supposedly telling

341.22 --> 345.72
us

342.3 --> 347.46000000000004
ow he turned back to the globe well that

345.72 --> 349.44000000000005
was a fake Mind Of God apparently

347.46 --> 351.539
because the real one

349.44 --> 353.759
they recognized

351.539 --> 355.919
pictures also

353.759 --> 358.91900000000004
came in the comment section to say yeah

355.919 --> 360.479
that's not me so I thought it was a

358.919 --> 364.4
little weird enough

360.479 --> 364.4
and he didn't say too much

366.06 --> 369.24
so

367.319 --> 370.97900000000004
yeah that was another troll trying to

369.24 --> 372.90000000000003
trick me I guess

370.979 --> 375.71999999999997
trying to create a rift of some kind

372.9 --> 377.88
hoping that I would go too far in what I

375.72 --> 379.52000000000004
would say and all that

377.88 --> 382.74
they like to do that they like to

379.52 --> 384.24
basically abuse my honesty my honest

382.74 --> 388.44
judgment

384.24 --> 391.74
make me go socially towards positions

388.44 --> 393.78
that I would normally not go towards if

391.74 --> 396.0
I knew

393.78 --> 397.55999999999995
like

396.0 --> 400.68
right

397.56 --> 404.72
I think you know what I mean

400.68 --> 404.72
but yeah I'm prepared for that [ __ ]

405.24 --> 412.919
because if somebody goes over the line

409.5 --> 416.4
and I'll only ever judge them about that

412.919 --> 418.979
and I will bring forth issues that were

416.4 --> 421.67999999999995
there and openly discussed in the first

418.979 --> 424.5
place right I don't go like oh you went

421.68 --> 427.8
too far now now I'm gonna

424.5 --> 430.919
like bring out all the dirt and [ __ ] and

427.8 --> 433.74
make up [ __ ] or no no I never do that

430.919 --> 436.46
right I get a little creative sometimes

433.74 --> 436.46000000000004
with my

437.22 --> 442.5
how I describe

439.86 --> 445.5
individuals

442.5 --> 447.66
terrible chronic Behavior get kind of

445.5 --> 449.58
creative with that

447.66 --> 451.08000000000004
but that's purely based on their

449.58 --> 453.0
behavior

451.08 --> 455.88
right so if

453.0 --> 458.34
somebody just out of nowhere has weird

455.88 --> 462.479
fluke

458.34 --> 464.94
supposedly if it's really them then

462.479 --> 468.06
I'll just address them on that and give

464.94 --> 471.419
my analysis on the the fluke on the

468.06 --> 474.3
weird act right

471.419 --> 476.46
and hey I could have technically said

474.3 --> 479.699
like a teamwork has

476.46 --> 483.919
like really behaved kind of insane and

479.699 --> 483.91900000000004
squirty and savanye like crazy

483.96 --> 491.63899999999995
but yeah he from

487.68 --> 493.979
year past seems to have like really done

491.639 --> 496.02
his best to get over that and he already

493.979 --> 497.28
expressed that like half a year ago in

496.02 --> 500.039
my chat

497.28 --> 501.96
and I was like genuinely impressed right

500.039 --> 505.139
so that would be crazy to hold against

501.96 --> 507.539
him even if he would like supposedly go

505.139 --> 510.18
back to the

507.539 --> 512.0989999999999
so yeah that's trolls trying to trick me

510.18 --> 515.82
trying to frame me

512.099 --> 518.88
doesn't work have you figured it out yet

515.82 --> 520.2
trolls it doesn't work no matter what

518.88 --> 523.399
you do

520.2 --> 523.399
it doesn't work

525.18 --> 532.019
sometimes I feel metaphorically like I'm

529.38 --> 532.92
an emperor in a castle surrounded by a

532.019 --> 535.019
bunches

532.92 --> 538.0799999999999
secret yeah corrupt Secret Service

535.019 --> 541.74
weirdos that are constantly trying to

538.08 --> 544.26
find an angle to like tear me down or

541.74 --> 545.76
backstab me right and I don't even get

544.26 --> 548.399
to see them

545.76 --> 550.86
just get to see you guys the people that

548.399 --> 553.04
I actually do trust that I bring to

550.86 --> 553.04
court

553.74 --> 558.66
but these bastards are still out there

555.899 --> 561.18
and they keep on trying to tear me down

558.66 --> 563.04
from the Imperial throne

561.18 --> 564.959
this is all metaphoric I don't actually

563.04 --> 568.0999999999999
think I'm in Emperor on the throne okay

564.959 --> 568.0999999999999
don't worry

568.26 --> 575.0
and they constantly try and it doesn't

570.66 --> 575.0
work it doesn't work

577.86 --> 581.58
right

579.54 --> 583.8
keep trying hey Nathan Oakley good to

581.58 --> 586.399
see you

583.8 --> 586.399
ah

586.98 --> 594.0
yeah seeking star water but I welcome to

589.98 --> 595.86
the stream by the way and Tower 306

594.0 --> 597.899
John Parker

595.86 --> 601.019
yeah trolls really are getting desperate

597.899 --> 603.0
they were always desperate though I'm

601.019 --> 606.6
just kind of amused

603.0 --> 611.339
my own weird little way

606.6 --> 613.76
how unsuccessful they really are here

611.339 --> 613.7600000000001
right

615.3 --> 621.12
I think there's only one form of success

618.2 --> 624.8000000000001
that they even achieve here from there

621.12 --> 629.16
perspective and that is that they

624.8 --> 630.959
can break me out of an explanation or a

629.16 --> 633.66
deeper thought by popping up and just

630.959 --> 636.06
being a [ __ ] then I will respond very

633.66 --> 638.459
quickly that'll take me out of the flow

636.06 --> 641.2199999999999
right that's like the only thing they've

638.459 --> 644.459
ever achieved they could never Fray me

641.22 --> 647.76
they could never demoralize me they

644.459 --> 648.959
could never make me say something that I

647.76 --> 652.14
regret

648.959 --> 656.959
when I do I immediately corrected with a

652.14 --> 660.36
smile on my face no damage zero zero

656.959 --> 664.279
zero damage trolls no matter what you

660.36 --> 664.279
try zero damage

665.16 --> 670.3199999999999
and yeah

667.1 --> 673.0790000000001
the trolls can't do anything to me and I

670.32 --> 675.48
feel proud about that in in its own

673.079 --> 677.7199999999999
right that is kind of silly think about

675.48 --> 677.72
it

680.88 --> 684.2
and at least it's something

684.839 --> 687.62
uh

690.18 --> 694.5
trolls are for the 77th

694.8 --> 698.899
wait what is that never heard of that

701.16 --> 703.76
suspense

703.8 --> 712.639
oh right the Branson yeah yeah wow

707.94 --> 712.639
oh that whole thing just was a big mess

715.5 --> 718.92
you know what was funny

717.18 --> 721.5
like

718.92 --> 722.9399999999999
everybody knows I I popped by it next

721.5 --> 724.8
year

722.94 --> 726.0
pretty much every day don't always hang

724.8 --> 728.3599999999999
around but

726.0 --> 730.579
it happened to

728.36 --> 733.62
patch

730.579 --> 735.4799999999999
I happened to catch Alex Jones right in

733.62 --> 736.86
a moment when he was actually mentioning

735.48 --> 739.639
him

736.86 --> 739.639
and Alex

740.579 --> 744.3
sure but they mentioned it no no it was

743.04 --> 745.4399999999999
Alex

744.3 --> 749.04
like

745.44 --> 751.3800000000001
he went near the edge of space that's

749.04 --> 755.42
how he called it he said yeah he went

751.38 --> 755.42
near the edge of space so he basically

755.7 --> 760.6800000000001
in contrast to what they were saying

758.04 --> 762.3
during the live stream yeah he didn't go

760.68 --> 764.0999999999999
to space I thought it was kind of like

762.3 --> 765.899
pretty cool of Alex that he would

764.1 --> 768.899
basically admit that

765.899 --> 771.959
without making it

768.899 --> 774.36
a Frontline issue just by saying it like

771.959 --> 776.399
yeah I went to the edges happened before

774.36 --> 779.5790000000001
and

776.399 --> 781.92
didn't go to space that's right that's

779.579 --> 783.66
right Alex thank you thank you for

781.92 --> 785.9399999999999
admitting that thank you for being a man

783.66 --> 788.16
about that

785.94 --> 790.9200000000001
uh

788.16 --> 794.2199999999999
you're edge of the Doom

790.92 --> 796.38
now yeah whatever the point is

794.22 --> 798.98
during the stream and the guy himself

796.38 --> 802.32
Wisconsin there we're going into space

798.98 --> 804.48
we've gone into space but no they didn't

802.32 --> 807.1800000000001
like technically they didn't like the

804.48 --> 809.54
half the show yesterday was about the

807.18 --> 813.0
Carmen line and Americans have

809.54 --> 815.519
arbitrarily reassigned where it is and

813.0 --> 818.1
it's all just [ __ ] they didn't go

815.519 --> 822.12
like even really by the official

818.1 --> 824.76
standards it just doesn't make any sense

822.12 --> 826.44
that just stood out to me that Alex said

824.76 --> 828.54
near

826.44 --> 831.0600000000001
is Right already suggesting that there

828.54 --> 832.92
should be a space out there but at least

831.06 --> 835.199
they didn't say that again they went

832.92 --> 839.2199999999999
just into space no no no

835.199 --> 842.3599999999999
technically they didn't Alex was correct

839.22 --> 842.36
that was just funny

845.1 --> 849.72
he was talking I I really got the sense

847.68 --> 852.3
that he felt a lot of people were watch

849.72 --> 855.48
looking at him

852.3 --> 857.16
that did that's funny because I pick up

855.48 --> 859.38
this stuff so

857.16 --> 863.06
pick it up with own Benjamin with with

859.38 --> 863.06
Alex Jones I pick it up a lot

863.1 --> 867.12
he gets like sometimes moments where

865.62 --> 869.22
he's gonna talk about something and then

867.12 --> 870.72
he gets this feeling like he's being

869.22 --> 873.36
watched

870.72 --> 875.22
thing is yes

873.36 --> 877.5
that's like

875.22 --> 879.9590000000001
the existential

877.5 --> 881.459
fractal effect

879.959 --> 883.92
yeah

881.459 --> 886.68
and he knows it he feels it and then I

883.92 --> 888.4799999999999
can sense when he picks up on that and

886.68 --> 891.42
then starts to

888.48 --> 894.72
like smoothing it out to make it

891.42 --> 898.519
optimally fractal to his long-term goals

894.72 --> 898.519
you feel that [ __ ] it's

898.56 --> 902.2199999999999
sometimes watching things programs live

901.199 --> 904.199
shows

902.22 --> 905.519
to me it's more about the things that

904.199 --> 906.4799999999999
they don't say

905.519 --> 909.0
right

906.48 --> 910.139
in a way in a metaphorical way it's very

909.0 --> 913.139
similar

910.139 --> 916.44
to interactions with galateral

913.139 --> 918.899
Lord of the Rings Hobbit remember like

916.44 --> 922.1990000000001
yeah she has a conversation she starts

918.899 --> 924.779
to roll out like an official

922.199 --> 927.779
Alvin Queen

924.779 --> 929.1
thing like basically to boost morale to

927.779 --> 931.32
give some courage to give some

929.1 --> 934.32
instructions and then she looks at

931.32 --> 937.139
somebody and then you hear the sub

934.32 --> 939.779
where you they telepathically contact

937.139 --> 941.639
well that's kind of a good metaphor to

939.779 --> 943.079
what that's like because you have a

941.639 --> 944.94
person what they're talking about and

943.079 --> 947.459
then you have their minds and what

944.94 --> 949.6800000000001
they're actually thinking about and why

947.459 --> 950.959
they're saying it and I pick up on that

949.68 --> 953.54
a lot

950.959 --> 957.06
I love that

953.54 --> 959.5999999999999
like my bonus sensories

957.06 --> 959.5999999999999
huh

960.72 --> 965.519
nothing impressive at all was done 90

963.0 --> 968.88
years ago yep

965.519 --> 971.839
right hey Amanda young good to see you

968.88 --> 971.8389999999999
Pam Cowell

975.6 --> 980.6990000000001
they're an impressive yeah but Pam cow

978.6 --> 983.0
what did they actually achieve doing

980.699 --> 983.0
that

985.38 --> 989.18
what is so impressive

998.06 --> 1006.04
to what to achieve what Pam cow

1002.18 --> 1006.04
what's the point of doing that

1006.62 --> 1012.079
I mean at this point it's it's like a

1009.62 --> 1013.1
the most expensive carnival ride ever

1012.079 --> 1015.62
made

1013.1 --> 1018.82
like that's really what that is how is

1015.62 --> 1018.82
that achieving anything

1025.16 --> 1031.039
it's the point of doing anything or

1027.5 --> 1032.48
progress my boy progress that I can't

1031.039 --> 1034.939
mean all kinds of

1032.48 --> 1037.22
right in this case doing that yeah it

1034.939 --> 1038.419
could perfect the engineering

1037.22 --> 1041.24
Oz

1038.419 --> 1043.8190000000002
but that's just as the thing in itself

1041.24 --> 1048.039
what is it gonna achieve like is there

1043.819 --> 1048.039
some amazing boundary that's broken

1048.799 --> 1054.62
they actually going into space are they

1052.64 --> 1058.9
what are they getting out of it except

1054.62 --> 1058.8999999999999
for all the personal experience

1059.78 --> 1063.1399999999999
as I said it's like a giant carnival

1061.94 --> 1065.78
ride

1063.14 --> 1068.14
very most expensive carnival ride in in

1065.78 --> 1068.1399999999999
the world

1072.559 --> 1080.6
oh wow well you're longing apparently is

1077.66 --> 1081.44
worth that price to you then right but

1080.6 --> 1083.6599999999999
yeah

1081.44 --> 1086.3600000000001
isn't that the same reason why you'd go

1083.66 --> 1087.98
into a carnival ride does you want that

1086.36 --> 1090.1399999999999
experience you want to feel that you

1087.98 --> 1092.0
want to go through that it's cool that

1090.14 --> 1093.679
makes it worth it to you

1092.0 --> 1097.22
yeah

1093.679 --> 1099.02
so it is a carnival ride it's just for

1097.22 --> 1101.419
the experience there's nothing actually

1099.02 --> 1104.08
achieved there's nothing

1101.419 --> 1104.0800000000002
really

1104.9 --> 1112.72
like some industry born out of it that

1108.62 --> 1112.7199999999998
really helps The Human Condition

1114.14 --> 1120.1000000000001
except for the ultra Ultra Rich that can

1116.78 --> 1120.1
pay for the carnival ride

1129.98 --> 1135.8600000000001
yeah Pam cow not worth it to me yeah

1132.5 --> 1139.1
that's right and if you'd have the money

1135.86 --> 1142.299
would it still be worth it

1139.1 --> 1142.299
what are you doing

1145.88 --> 1150.16
why did you time rocket lips out

1166.46 --> 1171.98
hey Jim what's going on

1170.179 --> 1175.179
look at his comment

1171.98 --> 1178.78
typical that cat weasel was the first

1175.179 --> 1178.7800000000002
uh yeah

1182.72 --> 1188.0
so what did he even mean by that

1185.9 --> 1190.539
and you're just talking about Branson or

1188.0 --> 1190.539
something or

1195.08 --> 1202.22
tell me AGM what what was the problem

1199.52 --> 1204.94
he's attacking you

1202.22 --> 1204.94
uh

1205.28 --> 1211.22
uh no

1208.22 --> 1212.84
he hasn't actually even

1211.22 --> 1215.6200000000001
aimed you

1212.84 --> 1215.62
once

1220.64 --> 1225.5590000000002
I mean do I need to read out every

1222.919 --> 1227.96
single comment he made here so far

1225.559 --> 1230.84
because he had like unless for some

1227.96 --> 1233.059
reason you think that cat weasel is

1230.84 --> 1235.28
specifically your name and everybody's

1233.059 --> 1237.5
supposed to know that I don't understand

1235.28 --> 1240.1399999999999
what your issue is here

1237.5 --> 1242.84
maybe you're a little

1240.14 --> 1244.88
your toes are a little sensitive today I

1242.84 --> 1247.34
don't know but I don't understand

1244.88 --> 1249.2
I think

1247.34 --> 1251.5
actually addressing you in the first

1249.2 --> 1251.5
place

1252.38 --> 1257.0200000000002
so please don't

1260.96 --> 1268.6000000000001
or maybe next time if you think he's

1263.679 --> 1268.6000000000001
missing you maybe you should ask him

1273.2 --> 1276.2
foreign

1310.419 --> 1315.46
basic capitalism first uh no

1335.36 --> 1339.1399999999999
pretty weird thing

1337.039 --> 1341.84
I think that's a really bad rumor to say

1339.14 --> 1344.0
that capitalism is the cause

1341.84 --> 1347.78
of hunger in the world

1344.0 --> 1350.24
when it's mostly thanks to capitalists

1347.78 --> 1352.1
capitalist societies

1350.24 --> 1354.559
and

1352.1 --> 1358.039
they're the ones actually paying for

1354.559 --> 1361.52
huge amounts of food

1358.039 --> 1364.64
to be basically shipped

1361.52 --> 1366.9189999999999
two Nations that needed a lot

1364.64 --> 1371.0
so I I don't understand it's not like

1366.919 --> 1375.76
capitalists are always trying to squeeze

1371.0 --> 1375.76
it will dry for food or something

1376.1 --> 1380.0
yeah exactly so you can start with

1378.74 --> 1382.4
that's that's the great it's the

1380.0 --> 1386.059
grappler you know hey capitalist Society

1382.4 --> 1388.46
unfortunately is also

1386.059 --> 1391.1
susceptible to Grapplers

1388.46 --> 1393.44
like they can get in and if you let them

1391.1 --> 1395.059
in the sense that you stood yeah you

1393.44 --> 1397.1000000000001
know hey this guy

1395.059 --> 1398.6589999999999
this Mega Corporation he's a Grappler

1397.1 --> 1400.039
look at what he done

1398.659 --> 1402.6200000000001
right look at what he's doing because

1400.039 --> 1404.78
how he addresses people

1402.62 --> 1406.3999999999999
what his ideas are and yeah if you're

1404.78 --> 1408.62
still gonna buy him because oh it's a

1406.4 --> 1411.64
little cheaper yeah yeah that's how you

1408.62 --> 1416.08
get grabblers everywhere yeah right

1411.64 --> 1418.94
that's you that's you being stupid

1416.08 --> 1420.9189999999999
ignoring everything just to get a few

1418.94 --> 1422.299
cents profit in the moment

1420.919 --> 1424.1000000000001
yeah

1422.299 --> 1426.02
that's just stupid

1424.1 --> 1427.58
right that's not because of capitalism

1426.02 --> 1430.76
that's because agreed and

1427.58 --> 1433.34
short-sightedness of the public

1430.76 --> 1435.44
that doesn't happen

1433.34 --> 1438.26
overnight

1435.44 --> 1441.679
that's culture that's a cultural problem

1438.26 --> 1444.98
also also thanks to advertisement and

1441.679 --> 1447.74
[ __ ] and just personal culture what is

1444.98 --> 1450.799
thought how to do things

1447.74 --> 1454.88
it's not capitalism capitalism actually

1450.799 --> 1458.059
creates a lot of wealth and allows it to

1454.88 --> 1460.0390000000002
go where it needs to go for things not

1458.059 --> 1464.539
to collapse right the thing about

1460.039 --> 1468.08
capitalism in a more Universal manner is

1464.539 --> 1471.5
it's always trying to fix the world in

1468.08 --> 1473.84
order to stay possible

1471.5 --> 1476.14
yeah that's basically what capitalism

1473.84 --> 1476.1399999999999
does

1476.659 --> 1483.2600000000002
it tries to keep everything stable so

1479.9 --> 1485.72
that it can continue being free doing

1483.26 --> 1487.52
what it does

1485.72 --> 1489.919
of course there's always going to be

1487.52 --> 1492.26
Grabbers trying to sneak in

1489.919 --> 1494.96
trying to demoralize

1492.26 --> 1497.36
make people stupid and short-sighted and

1494.96 --> 1499.96
turn it all into like corrupt crony

1497.36 --> 1499.9599999999998
capitalism

1500.539 --> 1504.1
but that's not inherent

1506.659 --> 1512.44
that's called corruption anyway

1509.779 --> 1512.44
uh

1520.94 --> 1524.6000000000001
look at me I can go to space you can't

1523.46 --> 1527.48
well no

1524.6 --> 1530.1789999999999
just I can't pretend to go to space in

1527.48 --> 1531.5
order to make everybody jealous of

1530.179 --> 1534.5800000000002
something they don't even understand

1531.5 --> 1534.58
doesn't exist

1534.98 --> 1540.38
it's it's the ultimate grappler's dream

1537.26 --> 1543.5
right what better than to make people of

1540.38 --> 1546.2
jealous of you over something that

1543.5 --> 1549.02
doesn't exist

1546.2 --> 1550.88
it's like the ultimate gravel

1549.02 --> 1554.6589999999999
right they're jealous of you over

1550.88 --> 1556.4
something that that isn't even real

1554.659 --> 1557.779
it's like the hands rubbing's never

1556.4 --> 1559.7
gonna stop

1557.779 --> 1562.279
right because they don't even know

1559.7 --> 1565.159
they're jealous over something that

1562.279 --> 1568.159
isn't even real

1565.159 --> 1568.159
foreign

1578.95 --> 1582.1090000000002
[Music]

1585.1 --> 1588.49
[Music]

1600.799 --> 1606.74
wow you need to rethink capitalism if

1604.1 --> 1609.5
you want to forcefully this

1606.74 --> 1611.24
why the [ __ ] would you want to do that

1609.5 --> 1613.1
buddy

1611.24 --> 1616.1
nuts

1613.1 --> 1619.0
now that's not rethinking capitalism

1616.1 --> 1622.34
that's completely and utterly

1619.0 --> 1624.679
annihilating the very foundations of it

1622.34 --> 1626.9599999999998
that's not rethinking Capital if you're

1624.679 --> 1629.48
if you're gonna

1626.96 --> 1632.3600000000001
and theoretically engage in anything

1629.48 --> 1635.84
like that and then call it some kind of

1632.36 --> 1638.1789999999999
new capitalism yeah that's total double

1635.84 --> 1641.779
speak reversed World form of capitalism

1638.179 --> 1645.26
that is absolutely anti-capitalism right

1641.779 --> 1646.779
because forcefully redistributing wealth

1645.26 --> 1650.899
is

1646.779 --> 1655.24
directly dramatically opposed

1650.899 --> 1655.2399999999998
to everything capitalism stands for

1660.02 --> 1665.799
I mean I'm surprised that I even need to

1662.419 --> 1665.7990000000002
tell you this Pam Cowell

1667.1 --> 1673.539
I thought that was like pretty

1669.74 --> 1673.539
universally known by now

1673.88 --> 1678.159
in except

1675.559 --> 1678.1589999999999
like

1678.679 --> 1684.76
University sjw zombies

1682.22 --> 1684.76
Maybe

1687.5 --> 1691.059
I hope you're not one of those

1693.88 --> 1698.779
[Music]

1695.779 --> 1698.779
foreign

1704.0 --> 1708.919
oh yeah sure well Pam Cowell yeah

1707.0 --> 1711.32
Branson can spend his money on what he

1708.919 --> 1713.5
wants yeah did did I say that he

1711.32 --> 1713.5
couldn't

1713.899 --> 1718.6399999999999
I didn't

1715.7 --> 1722.0
I'm very neutral about it

1718.64 --> 1724.3990000000001
I was just making clear like that's not

1722.0 --> 1727.22
actually achieving some

1724.399 --> 1729.58
it's just a very very expensive carnival

1727.22 --> 1729.58
ride

1746.059 --> 1749.86
yeah seeking style yeah

1749.899 --> 1753.1
Branson is very

1756.02 --> 1761.899
to what

1758.72 --> 1766.039
hey Pam cow did you know

1761.899 --> 1767.4799999999998
while he was doing this he was playing a

1766.039 --> 1771.32
song in

1767.48 --> 1775.159
in the craft during his thing called

1771.32 --> 1777.6789999999999
the new reset yeah

1775.159 --> 1780.2
and no that's not like a cheeky play on

1777.679 --> 1783.2
words that was actually a song literally

1780.2 --> 1784.3990000000001
about like the great reset

1783.2 --> 1786.799
about

1784.399 --> 1791.059
the cloud Schwab and all the other

1786.799 --> 1794.3799999999999
globalist [ __ ] yeah yeah very charitable

1791.059 --> 1797.36
person there I'm sure he has

1794.38 --> 1798.2
the general Public's best interest at

1797.36 --> 1801.74
heart

1798.2 --> 1804.0800000000002
app oh so Jared

1801.74 --> 1806.539
thank you for your charity

1804.08 --> 1807.74
promoting and being fan of the great

1806.539 --> 1811.24
reset

1807.74 --> 1811.24
that's just fantastic man

1813.559 --> 1818.799
I think you got him sized up completely

1815.899 --> 1818.799
wrong Pam cow

1825.14 --> 1829.3990000000001
all right and hey when you're that

1827.059 --> 1831.32
freaking rich and you engage in this

1829.399 --> 1834.799
sort of thing

1831.32 --> 1838.48
do you even own the money

1834.799 --> 1838.48
or does the money own you

1838.52 --> 1844.1
right when you're dead have that much

1841.159 --> 1846.0800000000002
wealth available to you

1844.1 --> 1849.82
the amount of things you can actually do

1846.08 --> 1849.82
with it the directions you can take

1849.919 --> 1853.76
severely limited

1852.08 --> 1855.74
right so

1853.76 --> 1857.96
you get enough money you don't own the

1855.74 --> 1859.88
money anymore money owns you

1857.96 --> 1861.799
right

1859.88 --> 1863.919
it's not as great as you would think it

1861.799 --> 1863.9189999999999
is

1876.26 --> 1881.12
a rocket blimps to welcome back

1879.919 --> 1884.5
yeah I think there was a little

1881.12 --> 1884.5
misunderstanding with AGM

1897.679 --> 1902.3600000000001
all right I knew it

1899.419 --> 1905.919
yeah well rocket Lynn I thought I

1902.36 --> 1905.9189999999999
thought you were doing that

1906.14 --> 1911.38
I think he uh I was a little

1908.48 --> 1911.38
misunderstanding

1911.6 --> 1915.26
maybe AGM is a little grumpy this

1913.58 --> 1917.059
morning

1915.26 --> 1919.779
I don't know with this weather I'm not

1917.059 --> 1919.779
surprised

1922.419 --> 1926.3200000000002
but anyway you're back

1933.38 --> 1936.279
hmm

1940.64 --> 1943.64
so

1946.94 --> 1949.539
hey

1965.09 --> 1968.1299999999999
[Music]

1976.1 --> 1981.08
right

1977.84 --> 1983.3799999999999
yeah I had a three hour call with rust

1981.08 --> 1983.3799999999999
ahead

1983.96 --> 1991.539
apparently he's engaging in

1987.32 --> 1991.539
kinds of mystical things right now

1996.559 --> 2002.6399999999999
that yeah I did give him

1999.26 --> 2002.64
a standards

2003.09 --> 2008.399
[Music]

2004.779 --> 2008.399
advice question

2010.539 --> 2013.679
I think it'll be all right

2022.24 --> 2028.019
all right but it sounds sense he's been

2024.519 --> 2028.019
he's like picking up

2029.98 --> 2034.26
the book

2032.019 --> 2034.26
foreign

2034.899 --> 2038.6399999999999
but yeah he's doing great

2040.299 --> 2047.2
you might be having some really awesome

2043.919 --> 2049.96
dare I say dream job ahead of him like

2047.2 --> 2052.78
really I totally down his Lane with

2049.96 --> 2055.48
freedom and opportunity to develop his

2052.78 --> 2057.639
specialty skills

2055.48 --> 2059.76
it's pretty badass I really hope he gets

2057.639 --> 2059.76
it

2063.639 --> 2068.879
right

2064.78 --> 2068.8790000000004
a great conversation with him yesterday

2069.22 --> 2073.24
uh also Owen Benjamin

2071.8 --> 2075.82
new stream

2073.24 --> 2078.06
seems like he's had some back issues

2075.82 --> 2078.06
again

2081.94 --> 2086.02
but yeah

2084.099 --> 2087.76
finished watching that stream this

2086.02 --> 2090.119
morning

2087.76 --> 2090.119
but

2112.48 --> 2115.48
foreign

2115.599 --> 2122.04
anyway it seems like my uh

2119.68 --> 2126.5789999999997
my

2122.04 --> 2129.64
949 show is is permanently gone

2126.579 --> 2132.4
I really feel kind of sad about it

2129.64 --> 2135.16
on the other hand it's it's probably not

2132.4 --> 2137.02
like oh I said something really unique

2135.16 --> 2139.2999999999997
there

2137.02 --> 2141.28
as far as I remember it was actually a

2139.3 --> 2144.4
really good stream but yeah there's

2141.28 --> 2147.0400000000004
nothing I can do about it

2144.4 --> 2150.04
but overall I don't know it won't be

2147.04 --> 2152.079
missed that much it's one out of a I was

2150.04 --> 2154.96
out of a thousand

2152.079 --> 2157.3590000000004
and everything I covered there I

2154.96 --> 2159.7
probably covered like at least 10 or

2157.359 --> 2163.3199999999997
maybe even 20 times over

2159.7 --> 2163.3199999999997
throughout every other show

2164.38 --> 2167.6400000000003
it is what it is

2202.42 --> 2207.119
all right so what have you guys been

2204.52 --> 2207.119
doing yesterday

2222.64 --> 2225.64
foreign

2226.12 --> 2236.46
[Music]

2255.4 --> 2262.38
eating cherries ah nice

2258.339 --> 2262.38
right you had a cherry Harvest Right

2265.92 --> 2274.54
spent yesterday morning the football

2269.98 --> 2278.2
yeah it was a major major bummer I agree

2274.54 --> 2282.48
like a lot of Brits at that sensation it

2278.2 --> 2282.48
was just it was really fubar

2283.48 --> 2289.599
and by the way I've seen some like crazy

2286.24 --> 2293.7999999999997
videos from before the match

2289.599 --> 2295.96
on just people like crazy

2293.8 --> 2299.2000000000003
people they're

2295.96 --> 2300.64
like late teens in their 30s like a

2299.2 --> 2303.7599999999998
whole bunch of people just running

2300.64 --> 2305.859
around and acting nuts and jumping on

2303.76 --> 2307.119
cars in London

2305.859 --> 2310.119
foreign

2307.119 --> 2310.119
nuts

2310.24 --> 2314.9199999999996
and that was before the freaking game

2313.24 --> 2316.839
now can you imagine what would have

2314.92 --> 2319.7400000000002
happened if they won

2316.839 --> 2319.74
Jesus

2322.839 --> 2329.74
right

2325.24 --> 2331.2999999999997
oh 20 pounds 20.

2329.74 --> 2334.8999999999996
[ __ ]

2331.3 --> 2338.5600000000004
that's a lot of cherries

2334.9 --> 2341.7400000000002
that's like a like a giant cement bucket

2338.56 --> 2345.7
full of cherries or something

2341.74 --> 2349.54
agent provocateurs uh well if they were

2345.7 --> 2352.96
agent provocateurs then you they were

2349.54 --> 2355.98
like 10 000 of them rocket blimps

2352.96 --> 2355.98
I don't think so

2356.68 --> 2361.839
I think they were just people

2359.2 --> 2363.3999999999996
like like the typical hooligan types

2361.839 --> 2367.18
that were like oh [ __ ] it we're gonna

2363.4 --> 2370.78
use this opportunity to just unleash

2367.18 --> 2372.72
and just become like a crazy mob

2370.78 --> 2375.3390000000004
I don't think there were

2372.72 --> 2377.98
provocators they they might have been

2375.339 --> 2380.4
among them as well but that would have

2377.98 --> 2380.4
stood out

2380.619 --> 2387.0
so it was really just people acting nuts

2383.619 --> 2389.92
because like nobody was stopping anybody

2387.0 --> 2392.68
nobody nobody was stopping other people

2389.92 --> 2395.28
from going nuts they were all just in

2392.68 --> 2395.2799999999997
the frenzy

2397.66 --> 2405.24
or quartz a jam roof

2400.72 --> 2405.24
oh see that's really impressive

2423.579 --> 2427.78
yeah you lock up people for over a year

2425.859 --> 2429.819
and they wonder why people react yeah

2427.78 --> 2431.92
good point grab it yeah that's why I

2429.819 --> 2433.3
said it's just people they're looking

2431.92 --> 2435.099
out

2433.3 --> 2436.42
they just like [ __ ] it we're gonna

2435.099 --> 2439.42
unleash

2436.42 --> 2441.9
this is it happens yeah it kind of

2439.42 --> 2445.7400000000002
typically happens with bigger important

2441.9 --> 2445.7400000000002
matches in football

2445.78 --> 2451.7200000000003
in England that seems to be a typical

2448.3 --> 2453.819
thing that I've even remember

2451.72 --> 2456.5789999999997
the days that I was a little kid like

2453.819 --> 2459.339
the 80s and 90s and yeah

2456.579 --> 2461.88
crazy football riots in England we got

2459.339 --> 2461.88
it on the news

2471.04 --> 2473.7599999999998
anyway

2474.88 --> 2480.52
um we're talking about which easy rights

2477.22 --> 2484.24
like South Africa man South Africa like

2480.52 --> 2487.56
shit's going down there it's like total

2484.24 --> 2487.56
Civil War [ __ ]

2493.18 --> 2497.02
right I'm a little worried about flat

2495.339 --> 2499.56
side and some other guys from South

2497.02 --> 2499.56
Africa

2501.7 --> 2507.5789999999997
I hope they stay clear of the danger

2504.04 --> 2510.04
because it's it's going down right now

2507.579 --> 2513.0600000000004
there or it has I don't know what's been

2510.04 --> 2513.06
happening in time

2545.619 --> 2549.6400000000003
really in Africa

2547.54 --> 2552.7599999999998
baking style water

2549.64 --> 2555.0989999999997
they did that there wow that sounds very

2552.76 --> 2558.2200000000003
familiar remember

2555.099 --> 2559.599
like during Trump in the US that

2558.22 --> 2563.0789999999997
happened too

2559.599 --> 2564.4
like black lives matter riots in last

2563.079 --> 2566.8590000000004
year

2564.4 --> 2570.88
like before that happened literally just

2566.859 --> 2572.619
trucks dumped off piles of bricks

2570.88 --> 2576.2200000000003
next to the street

2572.619 --> 2578.859
like for no reason except for to be used

2576.22 --> 2581.14
as weapons in the riots

2578.859 --> 2582.819
so you're saying that happened in South

2581.14 --> 2586.5
Africa too now

2582.819 --> 2586.5
or you mean England I don't know

2586.9 --> 2590.04
I haven't seen that

2608.339 --> 2614.2599999999998
okay you're Terror 306 if you say so in

2611.98 --> 2616.359
South Africa right so they totally say

2614.26 --> 2618.2200000000003
oh God

2616.359 --> 2620.859
right so they're just

2618.22 --> 2624.0989999999997
communist trashing the place then

2620.859 --> 2627.9
they're doing the same [ __ ] as the black

2624.099 --> 2627.9
lives matter riots from last year

2641.079 --> 2644.92
oh okay Adam

2643.3 --> 2647.52
hello by the way

2644.92 --> 2647.52
check it out

2650.44 --> 2653.099
really

2655.78 --> 2662.02
wait what Rogan actually did that are

2659.8 --> 2664.0600000000004
you sure that I should be putting

2662.02 --> 2665.44
somebody else's head

2664.06 --> 2669.599
thumbnail

2665.44 --> 2669.599
I haven't talked about this at all

2677.56 --> 2682.14
I guess I could try it seems a little

2679.54 --> 2682.14
weird though

2684.28 --> 2686.76
hmm

2687.46 --> 2690.78
anyway thanks for that

2691.54 --> 2694.92
it's clickbait

2695.079 --> 2701.02
okay well

2697.0 --> 2702.52
okay since I will put it in there

2701.02 --> 2704.859
uh

2702.52 --> 2707.5
Rogan I guess on his show called out

2704.859 --> 2710.64
Ransom that he didn't go to space kind

2707.5 --> 2710.64
of like what I've been doing

2712.3 --> 2720.1800000000003
what I was first though right

2715.42 --> 2720.1800000000003
I did it before rogans did it I hope

2728.68 --> 2731.22
Adam

2747.7 --> 2754.359
by the way guys I really appreciate that

2750.64 --> 2756.2799999999997
you and Nathan and maybe others are

2754.359 --> 2758.5789999999997
actually willing to do that [ __ ] for me

2756.28 --> 2758.579
because

2759.4 --> 2764.56
I don't like I like it I like that you

2762.16 --> 2767.0789999999997
guys are doing it I don't know if if

2764.56 --> 2769.06
you're actually only doing this to

2767.079 --> 2771.6400000000003
eventually encourage me to do it myself

2769.06 --> 2775.0
I don't think I would

2771.64 --> 2777.64
like that's not me I don't do clickbait

2775.0 --> 2779.819
but I'll allow you to do click bait for

2777.64 --> 2779.819
me

2780.46 --> 2784.26
right if you feel inspired

2786.52 --> 2793.02
I think everyone called it before Rogan

2790.24 --> 2793.02
okay

2794.38 --> 2797.28
LOLs

2813.339 --> 2818.5789999999997
no stallion 8012 haven't not heard about

2816.16 --> 2818.5789999999997
that

2820.06 --> 2825.46
but yeah there's a whole bunch of things

2822.4 --> 2829.0
like that going down

2825.46 --> 2830.7400000000002
did you know that a court in Germany no

2829.0 --> 2834.4
less

2830.74 --> 2837.0989999999997
actually find YouTube

2834.4 --> 2838.6600000000003
or censoring

2837.099 --> 2841.839
like

2838.66 --> 2843.64
videos of people being beaten up

2841.839 --> 2845.5
by police what

2843.64 --> 2848.44
in Germany

2845.5 --> 2852.78
like that stood out to me

2848.44 --> 2852.78
like oh oh damn time

2855.04 --> 2859.44
my cat call it out for Rogan okay

2878.26 --> 2884.5
right okay well I'll I'll take it

2881.74 --> 2887.3999999999996
I'll take the thumbnail

2884.5 --> 2887.4
and then we can

2888.46 --> 2893.04
disgusting

2890.5 --> 2893.04
what

2893.859 --> 2898.5589999999997
why is that disgusting no no you don't

2895.96 --> 2898.559
seem to understand

2898.66 --> 2904.8999999999996
B

2900.4 --> 2906.7000000000003
German Court find YouTube or censoring

2904.9 --> 2908.92
the video

2906.7 --> 2911.2599999999998
not for showing it

2908.92 --> 2912.64
it's not like YouTube refused to censor

2911.26 --> 2915.4
it and then they will find like oh

2912.64 --> 2917.92
you're supposed to abide by blah blah

2915.4 --> 2922.2000000000003
blah our party line no no they actually

2917.92 --> 2922.2000000000003
find YouTube for censoring the video

2922.42 --> 2925.359
you might have heard it wrong the first

2924.339 --> 2926.74
time

2925.359 --> 2929.0989999999997
I thought it was actually kind of

2926.74 --> 2929.0989999999997
remarkable

2930.4 --> 2933.9
ah finally

2937.66 --> 2944.7599999999998
now if only they would do that with

2940.18 --> 2944.7599999999998
everything else that would be great

2950.619 --> 2953.819
me outer space

2955.66 --> 2960.64
right I thought you heard it wrong

2958.48 --> 2962.7400000000002
yeah it's a it's a good thing so yeah

2960.64 --> 2964.0789999999997
even like in places where you least

2962.74 --> 2967.66
expect it

2964.079 --> 2969.88
sometimes like a good guy just

2967.66 --> 2971.68
pops or like a good guy a group of

2969.88 --> 2974.88
people suddenly do the right thing when

2971.68 --> 2974.8799999999997
nobody expects it

2976.0 --> 2982.38
only they would just continually do that

2978.52 --> 2982.38
non-stop that would be awesome

3000.119 --> 3005.28
right but anyway I'm like through the

3002.819 --> 3007.44
Dutch situation

3005.28 --> 3009.7200000000003
there's similar things going on as to

3007.44 --> 3012.18
what you mentioned like

3009.72 --> 3015.3799999999997
oh yeah people from our government are

3012.18 --> 3015.3799999999997
is they're really

3015.48 --> 3020.16
they have their cases are being built

3018.18 --> 3024.68
against them

3020.16 --> 3024.68
like it sounds pretty serious

3032.16 --> 3037.859
now if that is actually all going to be

3034.92 --> 3040.44
able to take them down from this this

3037.859 --> 3043.5
artificially created pedestal in the

3040.44 --> 3046.26
neo-fugal system is another matter

3043.5 --> 3048.859
but there is a lot of work being put

3046.26 --> 3048.8590000000004
into this

3060.839 --> 3064.0789999999997
all right by the way I'll link you

3062.64 --> 3066.5589999999997
through to that

3064.079 --> 3066.559
thing

3079.319 --> 3082.7599999999998
here's it right

3086.04 --> 3089.66
what is clickbait

3090.059 --> 3094.6800000000003
you don't know that stalin812 are you

3093.119 --> 3096.359
serious

3094.68 --> 3100.2799999999997
I mean

3096.359 --> 3100.2799999999997
have you heard of the internet

3101.099 --> 3107.04
come on click me

3103.619 --> 3109.2000000000003
bait for clicking

3107.04 --> 3112.98
it's like oh something that seems like

3109.2 --> 3115.3999999999996
oh that makes you want to know what is

3112.98 --> 3115.4
in there

3118.14 --> 3124.2599999999998
it could be anything like clickbait is

3121.8 --> 3126.059
real bad clickbait is usually false

3124.26 --> 3128.8190000000004
advertisement

3126.059 --> 3131.3390000000004
oh no the world is ending right now

3128.819 --> 3133.319
world war three is breaking right now

3131.339 --> 3136.7999999999997
and then you click it and it's like no

3133.319 --> 3139.859
it's just a Daily Show and

3136.8 --> 3141.96
literally not a subject

3139.859 --> 3144.38
in there right that's now that's

3141.96 --> 3147.54
ClickBank

3144.38 --> 3149.7000000000003
if we have to do something extreme is

3147.54 --> 3151.98
happening right now and then you click

3149.7 --> 3154.2599999999998
it and it's like absolutely nothing it's

3151.98 --> 3156.0
just daily [ __ ] right now that's

3154.26 --> 3158.8390000000004
clickbait

3156.0 --> 3158.839
hope you understand

3166.8 --> 3173.2200000000003
it's usually hyping it up out of

3170.64 --> 3176.1189999999997
proportion making it extra fascinating

3173.22 --> 3176.1189999999997
extra interesting

3176.16 --> 3180.42
just from people to at least click it

3178.8 --> 3183.42
the first time

3180.42 --> 3185.64
right and most of them will be like ugh

3183.42 --> 3189.3
this is just clickbait but the point is

3185.64 --> 3191.04
to get everybody clicking it so it gets

3189.3 --> 3192.1800000000003
registered clicks

3191.04 --> 3195.599
right

3192.18 --> 3198.5989999999997
it all has to do with like social media

3195.599 --> 3198.599
Dynamics

3202.98 --> 3210.02
huh all right 7812 I guess everybody

3205.8 --> 3210.02
knows learn something new every day

3215.5 --> 3219.219
[Music]

3220.2 --> 3226.7
I'm surprised that that the terminology

3222.9 --> 3226.7000000000003
has eluded you for so long

3229.68 --> 3232.5789999999997
foreign

3284.4 --> 3286.579
foreign

3302.54 --> 3305.69
[Music]

3320.28 --> 3325.38
ugh

3322.5 --> 3327.48
that's just [ __ ] up

3325.38 --> 3330.6600000000003
like

3327.48 --> 3334.94
like are there any details Beyond like

3330.66 --> 3334.94
it's literally just a disintegrated

3335.94 --> 3340.619
smoldering Foundation

3338.04 --> 3344.7
is that it or were there like a

3340.619 --> 3347.28
helicopters unusual amounts of unmarked

3344.7 --> 3350.9399999999996
helicopters or whatever

3347.28 --> 3354.48
going there like how did this happen

3350.94 --> 3357.42
like what are the registered

3354.48 --> 3360.48
signs like were there people in there

3357.42 --> 3362.579
did they all die but they literally just

3360.48 --> 3364.92
disintegrate with everything else or was

3362.579 --> 3367.2200000000003
the town evacuate what how did that

3364.92 --> 3367.2200000000003
happen

3368.76 --> 3372.559
locked out for two weeks what

3387.839 --> 3393.0589999999997
did get a vacuum wow

3391.38 --> 3396.5
that's

3393.059 --> 3396.5
so they just

3398.9 --> 3404.94
destroy everything just like okay

3402.66 --> 3406.319
you're not supposed to live there

3404.94 --> 3409.2000000000003
anymore

3406.319 --> 3411.119
this is supposed to be like forest and

3409.2 --> 3414.0589999999997
then they just literally disintegrate

3411.119 --> 3416.46
everything they just say okay go and go

3414.059 --> 3418.799
somewhere else

3416.46 --> 3420.599
this is no longer a place to live now

3418.799 --> 3424.04
it's like everything is going to be

3420.599 --> 3424.04
destroyed what

3435.18 --> 3440.16
need to be caused by forest fire but you

3437.4 --> 3442.44
already said that there were just trees

3440.16 --> 3444.66
completely unscathed right all over the

3442.44 --> 3446.96
place but that doesn't make any damn

3444.66 --> 3446.96
sense

3451.079 --> 3455.96
sounds to me like they just erased the

3453.72 --> 3455.9599999999996
place

3464.46 --> 3468.799
talking about rubbish peridot

3490.319 --> 3497.2799999999997
right okay well yeah sure that happened

3494.339 --> 3500.839
I want to know how it happened right

3497.28 --> 3500.8390000000004
because if

3501.54 --> 3506.819
Look At Me Gorilla Warfare advice right

3504.359 --> 3509.7599999999998
so if it's freaking helicopters doing

3506.819 --> 3511.319
that [ __ ] every time then maybe it's

3509.76 --> 3513.48
time some people

3511.319 --> 3515.7599999999998
hidden in the woods somewhere or is

3513.48 --> 3519.059
gonna get some like laser-guided

3515.76 --> 3520.92
missiles the freaking shoot down these

3519.059 --> 3523.98
[ __ ] helicopters

3520.92 --> 3526.26
with their Village disintegration

3523.98 --> 3529.98
weapons and just freaking shoot them

3526.26 --> 3532.44
down destroy them all or some of them

3529.98 --> 3535.92
right

3532.44 --> 3538.2000000000003
like it's totally illegal

3535.92 --> 3540.2400000000002
everything about that is [ __ ] illegal

3538.2 --> 3542.52
so why not get yourself a rocket

3540.24 --> 3545.16
launcher and shoot the [ __ ] out of those

3542.52 --> 3548.579
things when you know it it's actually

3545.16 --> 3550.799
the disintegrator helicopters right I'm

3548.579 --> 3551.819
assuming currently that it's helicopters

3550.799 --> 3555.119
because

3551.819 --> 3559.68
in the California places where they

3555.119 --> 3564.02
disintegrated entire play like villages

3559.68 --> 3564.02
it was helicopters that's what I heard

3570.78 --> 3575.9
CN what does that mean Jared Sanford

3580.5 --> 3584.52
right wow that was called Paradise all

3583.859 --> 3587.22
right

3584.52 --> 3589.44
okay I didn't know that I know there was

3587.22 --> 3592.7599999999998
a village there that was just seeing the

3589.44 --> 3592.76
pictures totally insane

3593.7 --> 3601.02
like an entire house pretty much resting

3597.24 --> 3603.359
with the roof against freaking trees and

3601.02 --> 3607.079
then the whole place completely

3603.359 --> 3609.24
disintegrated up until the foundation

3607.079 --> 3611.579
with those trees that were originally

3609.24 --> 3614.4599999999996
resting against the roof completely

3611.579 --> 3617.6600000000003
unscathed still standing around

3614.46 --> 3617.66
totally crazy

3621.66 --> 3624.6189999999997
clicks

3624.66 --> 3630.2599999999998
but the harp is not going to be able to

3626.64 --> 3630.2599999999998
do to be that specific

3630.72 --> 3636.1189999999997
I doubt it maybe it has like a secondary

3634.14 --> 3638.0989999999997
function maybe it's like a combined

3636.119 --> 3639.839
weapon the heart provides like the

3638.099 --> 3643.619
atmospheric electricity and then the

3639.839 --> 3646.14
helicopters focus and direct it into

3643.619 --> 3648.42
the actual destructive weaponized beams

3646.14 --> 3650.5789999999997
or something right I'm just very Loosely

3648.42 --> 3653.819
speculating here

3650.579 --> 3657.7200000000003
but it seems very integral that there is

3653.819 --> 3661.02
a local projector involved in order to

3657.72 --> 3663.4399999999996
do this sort of damage which from my

3661.02 --> 3667.28
information comes from these weird

3663.44 --> 3667.28
unregistered helicopters

3677.04 --> 3682.94
right

3678.96 --> 3687.799
no 5G time no no helicopters local

3682.94 --> 3687.799
Projectors no freaking Towers nothing

3692.94 --> 3698.76
5G Towers

3694.98 --> 3703.44
no harp just harp only harp does all the

3698.76 --> 3706.2000000000003
damage no freaking way no way no

3703.44 --> 3709.02
like this

3706.2 --> 3712.64
local projectors

3709.02 --> 3712.64
that seems to be the key factor

3720.0 --> 3724.52
current on the inside what

3724.74 --> 3727.3999999999996
oh

3733.74 --> 3738.4199999999996
all right

3735.0 --> 3740.46
yeah I'm gonna say whatever I'm saying

3738.42 --> 3742.619
it's freaking helicopters unmarked

3740.46 --> 3745.7400000000002
helicopters that are officially not real

3742.619 --> 3748.559
they disintegrate Villages right however

3745.74 --> 3750.7799999999997
they do it that's not my department I'm

3748.559 --> 3754.1400000000003
just saying it's those things so it's

3750.78 --> 3756.059
like oh forest fire you have to evacuate

3754.14 --> 3758.4
it said it's coming here right and

3756.059 --> 3761.579
there's absolutely no sign of any forest

3758.4 --> 3763.2000000000003
fire anywhere well get your laser-guided

3761.579 --> 3765.8390000000004
missiles ready because the black

3763.2 --> 3767.46
helicopters might just be coming in to

3765.839 --> 3773.0
basically disintegrate your village

3767.46 --> 3773.0
right that's my tip for the day

3778.559 --> 3781.52
foreign

3782.099 --> 3784.94
do that

3800.52 --> 3805.44
and that doesn't mean by the way guys

3802.68 --> 3809.0989999999997
don't be an absolute idiot

3805.44 --> 3812.099
if there's actually a forest fire like

3809.099 --> 3814.619
in the area you see the smoke clouds

3812.099 --> 3817.319
there's the fire right there you see it

3814.619 --> 3820.26
and then helicopters are coming don't

3817.319 --> 3822.7799999999997
shoot at those they are probably there

3820.26 --> 3825.1800000000003
to actually put out the fire okay I'm

3822.78 --> 3827.8190000000004
talking about when they say oh it's a

3825.18 --> 3830.0989999999997
forest fire and literally wherever you

3827.819 --> 3833.299
look there's absolutely no sign of a

3830.099 --> 3837.1400000000003
fire whatsoever it's way maybe a fire

3833.299 --> 3837.14
way into the distance

3837.72 --> 3842.0389999999998
and then certainly helicopters come

3839.94 --> 3843.9
flying towards your village that's the

3842.039 --> 3846.1800000000003
specific scenario I'm talking don't just

3843.9 --> 3848.4
go shoot at helicops don't be a complete

3846.18 --> 3850.3799999999997
ass

3848.4 --> 3853.14
ridiculous

3850.38 --> 3856.2200000000003
just watch out for those unmarked things

3853.14 --> 3856.22
that pop up

3861.839 --> 3866.18
tip for get a record launcher I

3866.819 --> 3869.96
yeah maybe

3879.539 --> 3882.3190000000004
I don't know

3883.079 --> 3887.039
seems a bit ludicrous I was like oh were

3885.48 --> 3888.599
you gonna wear the rocket launcher well

3887.039 --> 3891.6800000000003
I'm sorry

3888.599 --> 3891.6800000000003
I don't know

3892.68 --> 3897.18
right

3894.42 --> 3898.079
maybe another way I don't know maybe you

3897.18 --> 3900.72
could

3898.079 --> 3904.099
like a really

3900.72 --> 3906.72
long distance super high velocity

3904.099 --> 3910.6800000000003
heavyweight sniper rifle that could just

3906.72 --> 3912.0
shoot right through a helicopter at a

3910.68 --> 3913.859
vast distance

3912.0 --> 3915.96
you could shoot them out of there I

3913.859 --> 3918.299
don't know

3915.96 --> 3921.059
I don't know I'm not a military guy I'm

3918.299 --> 3923.099
not a military equipment guy

3921.059 --> 3925.7400000000002
I'm just saying I think that there's

3923.099 --> 3927.119
these freaking black helicopters that

3925.74 --> 3931.5789999999997
come by

3927.119 --> 3931.579
and just disintegrate entire villages

3932.339 --> 3936.24
and maybe we should do something about

3934.38 --> 3938.039
that since they're not even supposed to

3936.24 --> 3941.22
exist in the first place

3938.039 --> 3942.96
might as well just like go to war with

3941.22 --> 3944.3999999999996
it

3942.96 --> 3947.539
since they're not even officially

3944.4 --> 3947.539
existing right

3959.88 --> 3962.42
hmm

3975.839 --> 3980.7
because dude

3978.299 --> 3983.94
I think those things I think they're

3980.7 --> 3986.22
actually part of a covert hostile Army

3983.94 --> 3987.839
super high-tech weapons that's literally

3986.22 --> 3990.66
there

3987.839 --> 3994.16
as a covert hostile Invasion for us to

3990.66 --> 3994.16
just destroy things

3996.539 --> 4000.619
and who knows how like who knows what

3999.539 --> 4003.2000000000003
what

4000.619 --> 4005.42
they're really capable of like if they

4003.2 --> 4007.9399999999996
got a green light to literally destroy

4005.42 --> 4010.099
everything they might just be able to

4007.94 --> 4013.46
wipe out

4010.099 --> 4015.559
like a million houses in a matter of

4013.46 --> 4018.5
hours

4015.559 --> 4020.539
it could basically erase the the living

4018.5 --> 4023.78
space

4020.539 --> 4028.059
like of millions and millions of people

4023.78 --> 4028.059
in a day if they chose to

4037.579 --> 4042.7000000000003
sounds to me like the covert Army

4044.0 --> 4049.24
might be nice to maybe find out where

4046.64 --> 4049.24
they're coming from

4049.28 --> 4053.8390000000004
or do they actually have these [ __ ]

4051.38 --> 4056.2000000000003
helicopters with their secret weapon

4053.839 --> 4056.2
[ __ ]

4056.24 --> 4059.2599999999998
they actually come from

4059.599 --> 4065.299
all right where are they stationed would

4062.18 --> 4067.64
be kind of Handy to know wouldn't it

4065.299 --> 4070.42
be a good potential drone strike Target

4067.64 --> 4070.42
hmm

4071.359 --> 4075.5
just saying

4073.7 --> 4078.2799999999997
anyway

4075.5 --> 4078.28
move on

4089.42 --> 4093.38
yeah good served I don't know what

4091.099 --> 4095.539
you're talking about

4093.38 --> 4096.92
preparing a war against God that makes

4095.539 --> 4098.299
no sense

4096.92 --> 4100.4
but yeah

4098.299 --> 4103.58
technically with that kind of Weaponry

4100.4 --> 4106.159
if they wanted they could literally in a

4103.58 --> 4108.199
matter of days erase every church

4106.159 --> 4111.739
building in the country

4108.199 --> 4114.8589999999995
erase it disintegrate every last brick

4111.739 --> 4118.099999999999
of it just just like that

4114.859 --> 4120.92
no guys no mobs no

4118.1 --> 4123.279
Molotov cocktail [ __ ] just freaking

4120.92 --> 4127.4
helicopters flying around

4123.279 --> 4130.839000000001
yeah everything gone it's like all yeah

4127.4 --> 4130.839
they could do that yeah

4137.42 --> 4140.4400000000005
hey clutch bear

4144.88 --> 4149.14
ride I'll be back in two minutes

4233.719 --> 4236.719
foreign

4251.199 --> 4255.32
what's been all over the place but

4253.64 --> 4258.4400000000005
currently yeah we're talking about

4255.32 --> 4261.38
unregistered black helicopters with

4258.44 --> 4263.54
energy projection weapons disintegrating

4261.38 --> 4267.38
entire villages

4263.54 --> 4271.28
seems to be a thing and I formulated a

4267.38 --> 4275.179
haphazard strategy against it

4271.28 --> 4276.86
that sounded very crazy I'm sure

4275.179 --> 4278.4800000000005
been playing too many video games

4276.86 --> 4281.54
perhaps

4278.48 --> 4284.599999999999
but yeah I still wanted to say it

4281.54 --> 4289.06
I think that the device strategy is

4284.6 --> 4289.06
something they absolutely deserve

4293.06 --> 4297.02
because as far as I'm concerned the

4295.4 --> 4298.879999999999
group's doing this and they're freaking

4297.02 --> 4302.540000000001
little helicopters

4298.88 --> 4305.02
they are a hostile military Invasion

4302.54 --> 4305.0199999999995
Force

4305.6 --> 4310.06
that's literally what they are

4313.219 --> 4321.14
and every person being part of that just

4316.34 --> 4323.84
deserves execution by treason

4321.14 --> 4327.46
no exception

4323.84 --> 4327.46
they are terrorists

4330.62 --> 4334.0599999999995
absolutely they are

4334.34 --> 4336.88
foreign

4345.44 --> 4348.669999999999
[Music]

4408.04 --> 4413.3
helicopter on Mars what

4410.78 --> 4416.0599999999995
that got to do with it are you saying

4413.3 --> 4418.159000000001
that that is a symbol for yes we have

4416.06 --> 4420.4400000000005
helicopters of War

4418.159 --> 4423.5599999999995
are you actually saying that they're

4420.44 --> 4427.04
literally trying to communicate

4423.56 --> 4430.52
their plan of current operation of War

4427.04 --> 4433.159
cohort war on the people through oh look

4430.52 --> 4434.96
we got a helicopter on Mars is that what

4433.159 --> 4438.5599999999995
you're saying

4434.96 --> 4442.159
it seems so absolutely ridiculous and

4438.56 --> 4445.219
[ __ ] it might just be true

4442.159 --> 4447.62
that it's actually meant as a message

4445.219 --> 4450.159
like that I never I never thought about

4447.62 --> 4450.159
that before

4451.34 --> 4454.719
just so disgusting

4477.62 --> 4482.32
okay

4479.42 --> 4482.32
I know

4482.84 --> 4487.54
f

4484.64 --> 4487.54
in the chat

4516.86 --> 4520.0599999999995
where is that

4559.699 --> 4564.58
right in Canada yeah yeah I've heard it

4590.0 --> 4592.9
foreign

4599.9 --> 4602.86
foreign

4603.02 --> 4608.26
I have a really bad feeling about Canada

4605.719 --> 4608.26
guys

4610.699 --> 4614.62
okay

4611.719 --> 4614.62
who were they

4615.679 --> 4618.52
yeah Canada

4618.62 --> 4623.0
I already said it earlier I think that

4620.719 --> 4626.12
like the current government is the most

4623.0 --> 4628.46
evil government it's ever seen

4626.12 --> 4630.739
and they

4628.46 --> 4634.12
like blatantly

4630.739 --> 4636.98
want to destroy the country as in

4634.12 --> 4640.219
eradicate its people

4636.98 --> 4642.799999999999
like that is their primary objective the

4640.219 --> 4645.92
most satanic type of government setup

4642.8 --> 4647.96
Canada has ever witnessed

4645.92 --> 4650.719
it seems like nobody really knows what

4647.96 --> 4653.84
to do about it the only proper response

4650.719 --> 4656.3
would be a very very violent revolution

4653.84 --> 4658.46
that would end up in every single

4656.3 --> 4660.8
participant in government part of that

4658.46 --> 4662.3
being executed

4660.8 --> 4664.34
right

4662.3 --> 4666.5
but it doesn't seem like that's gonna

4664.34 --> 4669.159000000001
happen

4666.5 --> 4672.38
seems like

4669.159 --> 4674.48
rainbows and crap has clouded up

4672.38 --> 4677.12
everybody's minds and they're all just

4674.48 --> 4679.5199999999995
gonna roll over and die

4677.12 --> 4681.5
until like most of Canada has been

4679.52 --> 4684.38
depopulated

4681.5 --> 4688.1
and then it's gonna be like free grounds

4684.38 --> 4692.06
for whatever hostile Invasion force it

4688.1 --> 4694.820000000001
wants to move around and hide out there

4692.06 --> 4696.26
right they're probably gonna use it as a

4694.82 --> 4700.12
hideout

4696.26 --> 4700.12
after it's all been depopulated

4704.0 --> 4710.06
that would be my guess not a strategical

4707.48 --> 4713.678999999999
genius or anything

4710.06 --> 4713.679
but that's the feeling that I get

4718.219 --> 4723.56
if Canadians are so great

4721.4 --> 4725.179
and yet they have that government and

4723.56 --> 4727.820000000001
the government gets worse and it

4725.179 --> 4730.58
persists it's not even giving a slime

4727.82 --> 4732.259999999999
it's gonna stop getting worse at any

4730.58 --> 4735.679
moment ever

4732.26 --> 4739.06
well how great are Canadians then oh

4735.679 --> 4742.4
you're so great you're so great as Satan

4739.06 --> 4744.8
sits on top of you and rapes you to

4742.4 --> 4747.08
death you're so great

4744.8 --> 4749.719
huh so great

4747.08 --> 4752.6
oh Canadians are so great yeah yeah

4749.719 --> 4755.4800000000005
you're all gonna be dead though

4752.6 --> 4758.860000000001
in the not too distant future

4755.48 --> 4758.86
alright so that's really great

4759.76 --> 4767.12
keep the pride as you're all getting

4762.88 --> 4769.36
exterminated by your own very very evil

4767.12 --> 4769.36
government

4785.96 --> 4790.52
did that really happen did what really

4788.96 --> 4793.42
happened

4790.52 --> 4793.42
Kristen

4796.1 --> 4800.780000000001
oh Kristen

4798.98 --> 4804.639999999999
yeah I don't give a [ __ ] about your

4800.78 --> 4804.639999999999
freaking gay rights yeah

4808.34 --> 4815.360000000001
take your pride somewhere else

4812.12 --> 4817.659
or it's wrong whatever maybe I'm turning

4815.36 --> 4817.659
it around

4819.08 --> 4824.98
sorry sorry Kristen

4821.48 --> 4824.98
getting a little frustrated here

4835.94 --> 4842.178999999999
all right but and look

4838.699 --> 4843.62
I don't know if like Canadians are

4842.179 --> 4846.679
generally

4843.62 --> 4849.32
sexually perverted and nasty I think

4846.679 --> 4851.36
that their city Folk is extremely

4849.32 --> 4854.0599999999995
indoctrinatable

4851.36 --> 4857.179
and they have been indoctrinated to be

4854.06 --> 4859.219
Pro pedo as [ __ ] probably so then yeah

4857.179 --> 4861.139
you become that

4859.219 --> 4863.86
I don't think that they had that

4861.139 --> 4863.86
inherently

4869.54 --> 4874.239
pretty sure there's like other regions

4871.76 --> 4874.2390000000005
in Canada

4874.46 --> 4879.139
so this is a Saskatchewan

4877.58 --> 4882.139
like the North

4879.139 --> 4884.32
west region and they're not like that at

4882.139 --> 4884.32
all

4884.48 --> 4891.159
it's my guess I've never been there just

4887.78 --> 4891.159
got some people from Canada

4895.82 --> 4902.38
you know too much information Gerard

4898.82 --> 4902.38
Sanford don't even

4916.94 --> 4925.0599999999995
all right so fan of a b f

4921.679 --> 4925.06
what are you talking about

4926.3 --> 4932.26
did that really happen what are you

4929.659 --> 4932.259999999999
talking about

4936.76 --> 4943.1
oh no no no no get the [ __ ] out stupid

4940.94 --> 4945.08
piece of [ __ ] troll

4943.1 --> 4948.320000000001
[ __ ] off

4945.08 --> 4950.92
and you're fake [ __ ] story [ __ ]

4948.32 --> 4950.92
from people

4958.76 --> 4962.1990000000005
get a [ __ ] life already

4965.179 --> 4968.139
foreign

4986.36 --> 4994.699
yeah uh maybe we could not talk about

4990.92 --> 4997.1
sexual perversions yeah let's not squirt

4994.699 --> 5000.04
right it's it's not a good time to oh

4997.1 --> 5002.620000000001
now I have to remind myself how [ __ ]

5000.04 --> 5005.139
up things are so let's go watch all that

5002.62 --> 5007.659
forbidden [ __ ] just to tell oh it's so

5005.139 --> 5011.679
wrong it's so wrong no how about you

5007.659 --> 5015.699
don't think about that [ __ ]

5011.679 --> 5016.659
don't let Slayton Satan slip right in

5015.699 --> 5019.96
there

5016.659 --> 5023.5599999999995
take up hold and make you squirt about

5019.96 --> 5026.679
evil which is just as bad

5023.56 --> 5029.159000000001
as actually embracing it yeah let's not

5026.679 --> 5029.159
do that

5029.8 --> 5032.52
ugh

5047.56 --> 5050.580000000001
let's come back

5086.98 --> 5093.48
okay clutch bear I have to take your

5090.04 --> 5093.48
word for that I don't know

5169.96 --> 5172.96
fathers

5200.139 --> 5205.12
uh right so guys still got a half an

5203.86 --> 5208.0199999999995
hour left

5205.12 --> 5208.0199999999995
move on

5233.92 --> 5238.02
yes you can ask a question Kristen

5265.719 --> 5271.62
squirt meaning oh dear

5268.84 --> 5271.62
uh

5272.02 --> 5275.02
well

5275.139 --> 5279.2390000000005
it's kind of a metaphor

5280.98 --> 5284.259999999999
squirting

5282.58 --> 5286.9
basically

5284.26 --> 5288.46
well it's really the origin of the word

5286.9 --> 5290.799999999999
is kind of like

5288.46 --> 5294.159
it but

5290.8 --> 5297.159000000001
what it basically stands for is

5294.159 --> 5297.159
overreacting

5298.179 --> 5304.6
getting all riled up about something and

5301.42 --> 5309.219
displaying obsessive behavior and

5304.6 --> 5314.6990000000005
getting all overly excited about it

5309.219 --> 5314.699
or 30. that dude did fine

5315.34 --> 5321.159000000001
I'll take it as a sign of Purity that

5317.86 --> 5324.94
you don't actually know what that means

5321.159 --> 5324.94
that's good you

5327.28 --> 5332.159
but if you take it for what I just

5329.679 --> 5332.159
described

5342.76 --> 5350.1990000000005
right it metaphorically it's like

5346.96 --> 5353.28
you get worked up over something that's

5350.199 --> 5353.28
kind of a waste of time

5353.5 --> 5360.4
and then you put too much pressure on

5356.44 --> 5363.339999999999
yourself and then like a water bottle

5360.4 --> 5365.92
when you squeeze it it squirts you you

5363.34 --> 5367.659000000001
leak energy you you leak

5365.92 --> 5370.2390000000005
essence

5367.659 --> 5372.58
because you're squirting you're getting

5370.239 --> 5374.44
over excited about something that you

5372.58 --> 5377.32
probably shouldn't

5374.44 --> 5379.96
the words Obsession right that's what it

5377.32 --> 5383.58
really what it stands for

5379.96 --> 5383.58
it for me at least

5383.86 --> 5388.239
George overreacted on Canada yeah a

5386.56 --> 5391.719
little

5388.239 --> 5394.239
but yeah to be fair though I did kind of

5391.719 --> 5398.5
bring up the subject

5394.239 --> 5401.0199999999995
and I put down my rough opinion on it

5398.5 --> 5404.26
and so then I can't really blame anybody

5401.02 --> 5405.820000000001
in chat from Canada squirting about it a

5404.26 --> 5408.360000000001
little

5405.82 --> 5408.36
you know

5410.98 --> 5416.699
okay clutch bear thanks for that

5414.52 --> 5416.6990000000005
foreign

5418.719 --> 5421.719
bottle

5434.32 --> 5440.199
yes Kristen gross indeed

5438.159 --> 5442.36
right

5440.199 --> 5445.199
I I tried to spare you from it but

5442.36 --> 5447.88
clutch bear like the

5445.199 --> 5451.0
Canadian man that is just thought oh

5447.88 --> 5454.62
let's just let's throw that right in

5451.0 --> 5454.62
there thanks clutch bears

5458.32 --> 5463.599999999999
all right I don't particularly like

5460.84 --> 5467.400000000001
talking about that sort of thing so

5463.6 --> 5467.400000000001
but as an analogy

5467.5 --> 5471.94
yeah you can compare it to other

5469.48 --> 5474.159
processes and then it still works and it

5471.94 --> 5478.0199999999995
is kind of like Owen Benjamin lingo

5474.159 --> 5478.0199999999995
which I like using

5479.94 --> 5484.48
so yeah it could be just a squirt bottle

5482.5 --> 5488.4
you know it doesn't always have to be

5484.48 --> 5488.4
some disgusting guy

5490.179 --> 5495.28
secretly watching porn doesn't always

5493.12 --> 5498.82
every time you use the word it doesn't

5495.28 --> 5502.96
have to be that now if you are kind of a

5498.82 --> 5506.5
perv then to you that will be it

5502.96 --> 5510.12
yeah that's part of the test

5506.5 --> 5513.96
so oh oh you think about that well maybe

5510.12 --> 5513.96
that's on you

5517.719 --> 5522.4800000000005
right it's it's not it's definitely kind

5520.36 --> 5526.0599999999995
of a grown-up word

5522.48 --> 5527.919999999999
or bro word or however you want to

5526.06 --> 5529.900000000001
designate it it's

5527.92 --> 5532.92
it's not lingo meant for little kids

5529.9 --> 5532.92
that's for sure

5543.4 --> 5545.94
what

5554.92 --> 5561.6
but yeah Kristen uh you're doing just

5557.02 --> 5561.6
fine seem to be very sweet lady

5567.94 --> 5572.58
some words are inherently distasteful

5570.28 --> 5572.58
yes

5574.06 --> 5577.1990000000005
well they can be

5582.12 --> 5586.719
it's just that

5584.139 --> 5589.139
at this time I don't know a better word

5586.719 --> 5589.139
for it

5589.3 --> 5594.9400000000005
because of the before mentioned wider

5592.12 --> 5596.44
analogy right it's all about pressure

5594.94 --> 5599.138999999999
and

5596.44 --> 5601.48
wanting that pressure release letting

5599.139 --> 5606.2390000000005
that distract you

5601.48 --> 5606.239
from actually being productive

5612.1 --> 5618.1
like squirting

5614.08 --> 5621.5199999999995
designated is a distraction

5618.1 --> 5624.04
that comes from yourself

5621.52 --> 5625.96
and hey people get addicted to that it

5624.04 --> 5629.86
doesn't even have to be sexual they

5625.96 --> 5632.62
can't get addicted to doing that just as

5629.86 --> 5634.36
if they were like a dick right that's

5632.62 --> 5636.219
what makes it such a good analogy

5634.36 --> 5638.92
because there are people out there that

5636.219 --> 5640.9
just have to throw or they just have to

5638.92 --> 5643.36
say oh point out every time with every

5640.9 --> 5645.159
video they come across like oh oh this

5643.36 --> 5647.98
is all wrong it's so wrong oh you're so

5645.159 --> 5649.42
stupid yeah that's what I designate as

5647.98 --> 5652.379999999999
squirting

5649.42 --> 5654.46
they're squirting they're obviously

5652.38 --> 5656.679
overreacting on something it is

5654.46 --> 5661.56
completely pointless

5656.679 --> 5661.56
to do that in that scenario right

5732.1 --> 5739.679
oh yeah

5734.26 --> 5739.679
seeking Star Wars that sounds incredible

5750.28 --> 5754.739
ah making me hungry girl

5763.87 --> 5767.01
[Music]

5770.92 --> 5772.9800000000005
yeah

5773.8 --> 5779.02
so yeah Kristen

5776.619 --> 5781.739
got any other questions or things you

5779.02 --> 5781.7390000000005
want to know or

5783.639 --> 5788.4400000000005
I really appreciate that you're being

5786.159 --> 5791.98
inquisitive right that's that to me is

5788.44 --> 5794.5
like a very happy sign like wow it's a

5791.98 --> 5796.119
person they actually they're curious

5794.5 --> 5797.679
they want to know what I mean with this

5796.119 --> 5799.299999999999
that's good

5797.679 --> 5802.2390000000005
makes me happy

5799.3 --> 5805.06
so by all means you know and you don't

5802.239 --> 5807.759999999999
have to feel forced but

5805.06 --> 5811.5
you got more things you want to know

5807.76 --> 5811.5
you can always ask in my chat

5816.1 --> 5821.1990000000005
I get the feeling that

5819.159 --> 5823.78
you think stays consistent I'll probably

5821.199 --> 5828.36
even give you a wrench in the end

5823.78 --> 5828.36
all right not really oh okay

5833.98 --> 5841.299999999999
so how well informed about Flat Earth

5837.76 --> 5843.46
right what is our model what is our

5841.3 --> 5845.38
model uh

5843.46 --> 5848.32
well

5845.38 --> 5850.06
we're in a position really as flat

5848.32 --> 5854.5
earthers where

5850.06 --> 5855.9400000000005
it's less advisable to even claim a

5854.5 --> 5857.08
model

5855.94 --> 5860.32
right

5857.08 --> 5862.84
we got aspects we got provable empirical

5860.32 --> 5865.36
aspects and

5862.84 --> 5867.34
phenomena

5865.36 --> 5869.799999999999
that we know about and that we've

5867.34 --> 5872.139
analyzed

5869.8 --> 5874.54
and we got the knowledge of physics and

5872.139 --> 5875.5
natural law how that applies to

5874.54 --> 5877.78
everything

5875.5 --> 5879.58
and from that we draw certain

5877.78 --> 5881.5599999999995
conclusions

5879.58 --> 5883.719
and one of them is that well the

5881.56 --> 5884.619000000001
geometric orientation of the Earth's

5883.719 --> 5887.94
surface

5884.619 --> 5887.94
that it is flat

5888.76 --> 5894.159000000001
right that's the real thing that we're

5890.8 --> 5896.1990000000005
we are sure about we you should be Black

5894.159 --> 5898.48
Swan absolutely

5896.199 --> 5901.48
destroys the notion

5898.48 --> 5903.5199999999995
that would contradict that that the

5901.48 --> 5906.099999999999
geometric orientation of the earth's

5903.52 --> 5909.820000000001
surface is extremely flat

5906.1 --> 5911.9800000000005
right but that does not imply an actual

5909.82 --> 5914.259999999999
geometric shape

5911.98 --> 5917.619
and that's the issue and that's also

5914.26 --> 5921.820000000001
where the Ballers typically

5917.619 --> 5925.36
get stuck in trying to conjure forth an

5921.82 --> 5928.239
alternative geometric shape because we

5925.36 --> 5931.9
deny their ball so then they kind of

5928.239 --> 5933.4
straw man demand from us that we present

5931.9 --> 5934.96
the shape

5933.4 --> 5938.5
right

5934.96 --> 5939.94
when we have no such data we just know

5938.5 --> 5942.52
it's flat

5939.94 --> 5943.98
and there's still a lot of mysteries yet

5942.52 --> 5947.1990000000005
to be unraveled

5943.98 --> 5950.08
first and foremost one being one being

5947.199 --> 5952.659
that I personally like to point out and

5950.08 --> 5955.0599999999995
have tried to point out since the start

5952.659 --> 5959.638999999999
of my channel and that is

5955.06 --> 5959.639
what is the orientation of the Equator

5959.92 --> 5967.06
is it the circle that the Flat Earth

5963.34 --> 5970.78
disc model Believers suggested is is it

5967.06 --> 5974.080000000001
literally a circle in euclidean space

5970.78 --> 5976.179
when you follow the equator step by step

5974.08 --> 5982.36
every part of the way

5976.179 --> 5984.9400000000005
do you end up having turn a 360 degrees

5982.36 --> 5987.46
in that entire process

5984.94 --> 5990.159
or didn't you

5987.46 --> 5992.44
did you move in an exact straight line

5990.159 --> 5994.9
without turning which would be

5992.44 --> 5997.659
mystifying in many ways because of the

5994.9 --> 5999.46
consequences of that or was it a

5997.659 --> 6001.92
incomplete Arc

5999.46 --> 6003.659
and that's where the first attempt of

6001.92 --> 6006.659
the

6003.659 --> 6008.699
other elements of orientation

6006.659 --> 6010.379999999999
I'm in right because we know the

6008.699 --> 6012.96
orientation of the earth's surface is

6010.38 --> 6014.76
flat with certainty absolute certainty

6012.96 --> 6017.52
but

6014.76 --> 6020.2390000000005
how is the layout Act

6017.52 --> 6023.76
of everything on that Earth's surface

6020.239 --> 6028.379999999999
that's a bit of a mystery that seems

6023.76 --> 6030.84
glanced past a lot by every single

6028.38 --> 6034.56
person out there flat earther glober

6030.84 --> 6038.04
they all glance past it constantly

6034.56 --> 6038.9400000000005
what is this actual orientation of the

6038.04 --> 6041.82
Equator

6038.94 --> 6044.879999999999
it's still a mystery to me a lot of flat

6041.82 --> 6046.799999999999
irfers have argued assuming it was a

6044.88 --> 6050.82
circle and then said oh look at the

6046.8 --> 6053.9400000000005
flight routes it must be a circle right

6050.82 --> 6056.46
but nobody's actually physically went

6053.94 --> 6058.678999999999
out and measure and confirmed the

6056.46 --> 6060.2390000000005
equator to be that Circle

6058.679 --> 6062.82
never seen it

6060.239 --> 6064.44
ever hello the flat fellow by the way

6062.82 --> 6067.4
thank you for the 99 cent Super Chat

6064.44 --> 6067.4
donation and

6069.3 --> 6072.1990000000005
wow

6072.26 --> 6078.3
Eden with a petty [ __ ] oh he went to

6076.32 --> 6079.619
space no you're gonna defend more

6078.3 --> 6082.860000000001
bullshitty

6079.619 --> 6085.44
bullshitters that's fine

6082.86 --> 6087.719
just know that he didn't went to space

6085.44 --> 6089.219
even by the official standards

6087.719 --> 6092.219
it's okay

6089.219 --> 6095.4
you can think that he did yeah you can

6092.219 --> 6098.159
think that outer space is at your

6095.4 --> 6101.099999999999
rooftop yeah you can think that if you

6098.159 --> 6104.219
want to and you can imagine if I jump up

6101.1 --> 6108.06
now then suddenly gravity will stop and

6104.219 --> 6111.4800000000005
I will float until I go back down again

6108.06 --> 6115.159000000001
and land yeah you can think that right

6111.48 --> 6115.159
and it doesn't mean that it's there

6122.88 --> 6125.42
right

6128.159 --> 6133.339999999999
by the way next time please don't time

6130.32 --> 6133.34
out something like that

6133.679 --> 6139.02
just amusement

6135.9 --> 6140.699
not personally attacking any individual

6139.02 --> 6144.0
here

6140.699 --> 6146.699
so please take it easy on the timing

6144.0 --> 6149.219
outs guys I mean it

6146.699 --> 6153.5
has been an issue before

6149.219 --> 6153.5
I get it that you did that just

6154.08 --> 6159.0
it's not really necessary like if they

6156.6 --> 6162.2390000000005
constantly start spamming and [ __ ] okay

6159.0 --> 6165.56
okay but just one sentence

6162.239 --> 6165.5599999999995
not necessary

6165.6 --> 6170.76
yeah that's right goat servant it seems

6168.06 --> 6173.54
that Eugene is fooled by the stunt

6170.76 --> 6173.54
that's right

6183.84 --> 6189.719
you would think about the magnetic north

6186.36 --> 6191.94
moving towards Siberia

6189.719 --> 6194.88
uh

6191.94 --> 6196.619
I don't know

6194.88 --> 6200.34
sure

6196.619 --> 6202.199
if that's what's happening then I guess

6200.34 --> 6205.619000000001
that's what's happening

6202.199 --> 6207.419999999999
I mean I've heard the stories lots of

6205.619 --> 6211.32
them

6207.42 --> 6214.86
I've seen it demonstrate it through

6211.32 --> 6217.0199999999995
models how it's supposed to be happening

6214.86 --> 6219.119
right of course all presupposing a ball

6217.02 --> 6221.1
Earth underneath it

6219.119 --> 6223.259999999999
but yeah apparently the magnetic north

6221.1 --> 6226.9400000000005
is Shifting somewhat towards Siberia

6223.26 --> 6226.9400000000005
could be I don't know why

6227.46 --> 6234.2390000000005
I don't know why the magnetics on the

6231.06 --> 6236.159000000001
Earth are the way they are exactly I

6234.239 --> 6239.5199999999995
don't know why

6236.159 --> 6242.219
it's there exactly I know kind of like

6239.52 --> 6244.080000000001
roughly how magnetics works

6242.219 --> 6247.08
and that it's there

6244.08 --> 6249.96
I don't know how how it is actually

6247.08 --> 6252.48
generated though what actually is

6249.96 --> 6253.8
generating the Magnetic North and South

6252.48 --> 6255.78
Poles

6253.8 --> 6257.76
two South walls

6255.78 --> 6260.4
I don't know what is literally

6257.76 --> 6263.219
generating that what is the cause of it

6260.4 --> 6265.679
and therefore also a presumed cause of

6263.219 --> 6268.46
it shifting I don't know I just know it

6265.679 --> 6268.46
seems to be there

6268.739 --> 6271.739
foreign

6278.78 --> 6285.32
yeah I've heard that

6281.219 --> 6289.199
right so yes yes the non-local

6285.32 --> 6291.119
holographic light of the Sun appears to

6289.199 --> 6294.78
go in circles

6291.119 --> 6298.739
without going down at the Arctic region

6294.78 --> 6300.9
yes I've heard that that's right

6298.739 --> 6303.178999999999
so the thing

6300.9 --> 6305.759999999999
that is not actually physically a thing

6303.179 --> 6308.639
doesn't have a euclidean position in

6305.76 --> 6310.5
space seems to be going in circles over

6308.639 --> 6312.6
at the Arctic region yeah it's very

6310.5 --> 6315.239
mysterious isn't it

6312.6 --> 6318.0
doesn't explain anything though

6315.239 --> 6320.159
because we can't even determine that it

6318.0 --> 6321.06
is a physical object in a euclidean

6320.159 --> 6322.5599999999995
position

6321.06 --> 6325.26
anywhere

6322.56 --> 6328.1990000000005
you can approach the sun you can't see

6325.26 --> 6330.06
the angular size of a change as you

6328.199 --> 6333.119
approach it

6330.06 --> 6335.76
you can't pinpoint it at all

6333.119 --> 6337.0199999999995
so what does it in the face of that data

6335.76 --> 6340.1990000000005
matter even

6337.02 --> 6344.1
how it's presenting itself in one region

6340.199 --> 6347.839999999999
what relevance is that to anything

6344.1 --> 6347.84
but it's not really relevant to me

6349.32 --> 6355.0199999999995
right yeah the Antarctic Circle video is

6352.32 --> 6357.299999999999
edited that's right that that one is a

6355.02 --> 6359.76
blatant fraud that's correct you're at

6357.3 --> 6360.84
Sanford it only seems to happen at the

6359.76 --> 6363.3
North

6360.84 --> 6366.1990000000005
right and again

6363.3 --> 6370.1990000000005
yeah that would

6366.199 --> 6374.099999999999
suggests that the disc model with the

6370.199 --> 6376.739
sun and the moon all over it yeah that

6374.1 --> 6379.5
might be more real

6376.739 --> 6382.5
yet still any euclidean literal position

6379.5 --> 6386.94
or physical nature of the moon and the

6382.5 --> 6390.6
sun has yet to be found right so

6386.94 --> 6393.839999999999
yeah sure they can use it

6390.6 --> 6397.5
to smash Ballers with that argument but

6393.84 --> 6402.9800000000005
they still don't have any actual proof

6397.5 --> 6402.98
what it is where it is how it is

6416.34 --> 6423.719
no Pam cow that's that's lies

6421.02 --> 6426.2390000000005
you're lying now

6423.719 --> 6428.699
or you're just bluffing

6426.239 --> 6433.259999999999
and you think you might be right because

6428.699 --> 6436.86
that's wrong there's only one video One

6433.26 --> 6439.38
video blatantly edited showing the same

6436.86 --> 6442.08
Cloud bank with exactly the same form

6439.38 --> 6444.679
coming back twice

6442.08 --> 6444.679
yeah

6444.96 --> 6451.02
there is only

6446.78 --> 6453.659
one 24-hour Sun video of Antarctica and

6451.02 --> 6456.84
it was a blatant fraud

6453.659 --> 6458.638999999999
provably so yeah so I will call you a

6456.84 --> 6461.6990000000005
liar because there is only one video

6458.639 --> 6464.9400000000005
there is no other video it's a lie there

6461.699 --> 6468.119
is no other video Zero Zero videos only

6464.94 --> 6471.119
that one video it's a fraud there is no

6468.119 --> 6472.739
video of a 24-hour sun in Antarctica

6471.119 --> 6476.759999999999
anywhere

6472.739 --> 6481.32
there's no unedited 24-hour Sun Video in

6476.76 --> 6484.619000000001
Antarctica zero zero zero

6481.32 --> 6487.699
so I will call you a liar or you're just

6484.619 --> 6487.699
being really stupid

6489.3 --> 6497.159000000001
no there is zero there is zero of these

6492.36 --> 6499.08
videos you are a liar Pam Cowell you are

6497.159 --> 6501.54
a liar

6499.08 --> 6506.58
I am going to ban you if you persist

6501.54 --> 6507.9
your lies there is zero videos of 24

6506.58 --> 6511.86
hours

6507.9 --> 6514.28
sun in Antarctica that's a lie you are

6511.86 --> 6514.28
lying

6531.3 --> 6537.3
yeah and now you're a band get the [ __ ]

6533.46 --> 6540.659
out you filthy lying [ __ ]

6537.3 --> 6543.2390000000005
yeah I've been here doing what I do and

6540.659 --> 6547.98
being part of the flatter of debates

6543.239 --> 6551.099999999999
since 2015 if there was more than that

6547.98 --> 6554.28
one edited [ __ ] video of a 24-hour

6551.1 --> 6555.54
Sun supposedly on the Antarctica I would

6554.28 --> 6558.239
have known about it it would be

6555.54 --> 6560.159
Frontline news I would be showing it

6558.239 --> 6561.959999999999
right now

6560.159 --> 6564.36
as an example

6561.96 --> 6568.58
saying oh look there's another edited

6564.36 --> 6573.299999999999
video because there is no unedited

6568.58 --> 6575.4
24-hour Antarctic Sun video and that's a

6573.3 --> 6578.639
fact and that's going to be a fact

6575.4 --> 6582.36
forever because it doesn't exist the

6578.639 --> 6584.88
very notion of it is an invention based

6582.36 --> 6586.5
on the presupposition that the Earth is

6584.88 --> 6589.8
a sphere

6586.5 --> 6592.679
and that the sun is supposedly out there

6589.8 --> 6595.1990000000005
in order for you to have that experience

6592.679 --> 6597.7390000000005
as you would in the North

6595.199 --> 6602.159
yeah that's an invention based on

6597.739 --> 6604.879999999999
heliocentric lies it doesn't exist

6602.159 --> 6608.28
not that it matters to me though because

6604.88 --> 6612.119
if there was a 24-hour sun in Antarctica

6608.28 --> 6615.0
I'd be perfectly fine with it I don't

6612.119 --> 6618.179
care because it's still not going to be

6615.0 --> 6621.239
an object in a euclidean position

6618.179 --> 6623.46
it's holographic it doesn't have a

6621.239 --> 6627.598999999999
position it's light

6623.46 --> 6630.4800000000005
you see it at an angle that's it

6627.599 --> 6632.82
that's the data available there is no

6630.48 --> 6635.4
more data the rest is all machination

6632.82 --> 6638.299999999999
[ __ ] oh what you're gonna send a

6635.4 --> 6638.299999999999
radio signal

6638.4 --> 6642.42
to the to the gas giant with the black

6641.4 --> 6646.5599999999995
body

6642.42 --> 6647.84
to detect its distance or some [ __ ]

6646.56 --> 6650.9400000000005
like that

6647.84 --> 6653.28
yeah sure sure yeah it's not an object

6650.94 --> 6656.82
it's holographic it doesn't have a

6653.28 --> 6658.04
position it only has an apparent angular

6656.82 --> 6660.84
position

6658.04 --> 6663.44
perspective doesn't apply

6660.84 --> 6663.4400000000005
huh

6663.9 --> 6669.9
you're not gonna prove a globe one way

6666.48 --> 6673.739
or the other even if there was an actual

6669.9 --> 6676.32
unedited 24-hour sun and Arctic video

6673.739 --> 6680.07
it's not gonna prove [ __ ] it's not gonna

6676.32 --> 6683.099999999999
prove your Globe better get over it

6720.06 --> 6725.400000000001
what did Rohan

6722.639 --> 6728.0
I don't know what Rohan said about

6725.4 --> 6728.0
Bronson

6732.239 --> 6736.799999999999
Rohan said anything it would probably

6734.639 --> 6740.219
where the hell is your horse and why

6736.8 --> 6742.679
didn't you show up for the big war

6740.219 --> 6745.199
unless you went Rogan

6742.679 --> 6748.32
in that case he said hey you didn't go

6745.199 --> 6750.419999999999
to space did you like every other person

6748.32 --> 6752.599
in the world that's heard about that

6750.42 --> 6752.599
event

6761.28 --> 6764.88
thank you

6762.84 --> 6767.599

6793.199 --> 6799.739
get a life get a point

6797.28 --> 6802.5599999999995
echoing

6799.739 --> 6804.839999999999
stupid songs out there it's not really

6802.56 --> 6808.5
doing anything

6804.84 --> 6811.1990000000005
it's just you squirting

6808.5 --> 6812.52
under a stupid act that's all fine

6811.199 --> 6814.919999999999
though

6812.52 --> 6816.84
you know it's just I don't want people

6814.92 --> 6819.36
to do that in here

6816.84 --> 6823.5
this is this chat here is not a place

6819.36 --> 6825.239
for you to be a dumb [ __ ] and just say

6823.5 --> 6827.639
stupid [ __ ] that doesn't really mean

6825.239 --> 6830.638999999999
anything or it doesn't contribute to

6827.639 --> 6832.619
actual conversations happening

6830.639 --> 6834.719
doesn't mean it's gonna have to be

6832.619 --> 6836.82
banned for that it's just kind of

6834.719 --> 6840.7390000000005
pointless when you do it so please

6836.82 --> 6840.739
refrain I'm doing that

6841.38 --> 6845.4800000000005
ah

6842.76 --> 6845.4800000000005
what happened

6846.84 --> 6853.26
well Bronson went into Virgin Galactic

6850.38 --> 6856.56
claimed he went into space claimed he

6853.26 --> 6857.88
was weightless strapping out of his

6856.56 --> 6861.84
belts

6857.88 --> 6864.3
upon the stopping of the rocket when he

6861.84 --> 6866.9400000000005
was still going upward and they didn't

6864.3 --> 6869.159000000001
show it and he played a really really

6866.94 --> 6872.638999999999
[ __ ] up song called

6869.159 --> 6876.9
the great reset because he is a filthy

6872.639 --> 6879.06
[ __ ] scumbag eugenicist

6876.9 --> 6882.48
yeah

6879.06 --> 6885.3
and then yeah everybody says oh he went

6882.48 --> 6887.459999999999
to space he went to space even though he

6885.3 --> 6889.139
didn't actually go into space by

6887.46 --> 6891.36
official standards of where that's

6889.139 --> 6893.46
pretty supposed to be where that's

6891.36 --> 6896.098999999999
supposed to be right he didn't actually

6893.46 --> 6898.679
do that by their own freaking standard

6896.099 --> 6900.659000000001
but he's saying that he's done that and

6898.679 --> 6903.119
so everybody got him to the conclusion

6900.659 --> 6905.4
yeah that's [ __ ]

6903.119 --> 6908.04
And when everybody comes to the

6905.4 --> 6911.96
conclusion then it the final person to

6908.04 --> 6911.96
admit that will be Joe Rogan

6913.98 --> 6917.659
you know he's always the last

6932.639 --> 6936.96
that's right lamell forever that's

6934.38 --> 6941.219
exactly what it is

6936.96 --> 6944.159
and hey I I appreciate the vehicle

6941.219 --> 6947.659
I kind of think it's cool I think it's a

6944.159 --> 6947.659
very eloquent interesting design

6947.76 --> 6952.7390000000005
but does that make it

6950.88 --> 6954.2390000000005
useful

6952.739 --> 6957.54
no

6954.239 --> 6962.159
it's just a over a hyped Carnival right

6957.54 --> 6965.36
it's very very expensive Carnival right

6962.159 --> 6965.36
that's what it is to me

6965.58 --> 6969.719
oh [ __ ]

6967.08 --> 6971.099
