1.659 --> 11.719000000000001
good morning this is flat earth

6.319 --> 16.1
early-bird episode 5 I'm Arwen your host

11.719 --> 18.83
and yeah we're gonna do the hangout on

16.1 --> 23.12
schedule despite Nathan pretty much

18.83 --> 25.369999999999997
starting at the same time and yeah he

23.12 --> 27.770000000000003
said just go ahead anyway so I plan to

25.37 --> 30.740000000000002
originally postpone it to after the

27.77 --> 33.41
debates but yeah I'm just gonna do it

30.74 --> 37.82
anyway and it's an even told me he might

33.41 --> 41.75
actually join the panel which would be

37.82 --> 48.38
very interesting to see so yeah I have

41.75 --> 50.86
no guests currently so sit through this

48.38 --> 50.86
by myself

53.71 --> 58.67
pass out some links to a couple of

56.36 --> 69.11
people I didn't quite do that because I

58.67 --> 71.9
thought wasn't gonna happen but I'm

69.11 --> 74.5
gonna do that right now let's see who

71.9 --> 74.5
joins me

83.77 --> 93.58
my Enter key sucks constantly

89.33 --> 96.47
bash my keyboard every time hey Eric

93.58 --> 100.19
mornin herb afternoon whatever time it

96.47 --> 107.71
is there yeah it's just a little after

100.19 --> 111.86
2:00 yeah - okay that's right 14:04

107.71 --> 113.92999999999999
right so hey thanks for coming yeah see

111.86 --> 119.0
you soon Athan actually starting no he's

113.93 --> 121.58000000000001
not starting late anyway yeah so how are

119.0 --> 126.14
you doing well not too bad

121.58 --> 131.66
want to check something out what let me

126.14 --> 148.67000000000002
uh how do I I came across this here

131.66 --> 149.81
let's see alright so can you see this

148.67 --> 152.89999999999998
all right

149.81 --> 156.98
the Texas Tesla teller yeah yeah have

152.9 --> 158.93
you read the the company's page uh no I

156.98 --> 161.709
haven't really dug into it but I thought

158.93 --> 165.769
it was fascinating and I saw a video

161.709 --> 168.4
describing a lot of this and yeah that

165.769 --> 171.11
sounded very legit like a real thing

168.4 --> 175.01000000000002
well it's funny they're using you know

171.11 --> 176.66000000000003
global care but basically if what

175.01 --> 178.97
they're claiming they're engaged here is

176.66 --> 181.31
Wireless what do they say I mean they're

178.97 --> 185.12
saying energy but you could say maybe

181.31 --> 186.489
Wi-Fi video anyway you're familiar with

185.12 --> 189.14000000000001
Tesla Tower

186.489 --> 192.85
yeah can do so many things there's

189.14 --> 195.95
nothing about satellites here in that

192.85 --> 197.45
but they're gonna beam this old around

195.95 --> 199.25
to the earth of course they're still

197.45 --> 201.17
saying that so I mean how is this gonna

199.25 --> 206.45
happen throughout refraction I guess

201.17 --> 209.05999999999997
they're still gonna cling to that so

206.45 --> 211.7
yeah what did you learn anything

209.06 --> 214.959
interesting about this company you know

211.7 --> 216.54899999999998
it's it sounds all global you

214.959 --> 219.189
eco-friendly I mean look at their

216.549 --> 222.12900000000002
website blue color blue color green you

219.189 --> 223.599
know yeah but what are they doing with

222.129 --> 227.739
it what are they presenting themselves

223.599 --> 230.61999999999998
as well what is I mean how it works so

227.739 --> 233.379
they're saying that a bunch of pet and

230.62 --> 236.98000000000002
all this crap that there are certain the

233.379 --> 238.78
zenyk surface wave which i guess is some

236.98 --> 242.56
scientists from that was in Jonathan's

238.78 --> 244.54
anak 1871 to 1959 so what do they say

242.56 --> 247.78
the seventh wave is an electromagnetic

244.54 --> 250.689
wave it uses the surface of the earth as

247.78 --> 253.9
a waveguide that's interesting the

250.689 --> 256.0
surface of the earth is a waveguide okay

253.9 --> 260.31
and I'm able again to carry

256.0 --> 260.31
communication signals electrical power

260.4 --> 264.78
efficiently over long distances around

263.889 --> 268.21000000000004
the curve

264.78 --> 270.00899999999996
don't use rating a little well ya cannot

268.21 --> 277.03
how about this you can just make the

270.009 --> 278.77000000000004
text bigger is that better I could

277.03 --> 282.76
because there's like this picture to the

278.77 --> 287.59
left and okay how's that how you're sure

282.76 --> 289.71999999999997
okay no too much yeah

287.59 --> 294.28
so they're using these Zdenek surface

289.72 --> 295.36
waves for power communications where is

294.28 --> 297.34
it that is not I'd want to go to the

295.36 --> 299.47
history here so they're talking nothing

297.34 --> 303.479
about satellites they're gonna be

299.47 --> 308.889
beaming wireless power and

303.479 --> 310.50899999999996
communications around the earth you know

308.889 --> 312.729
they use the whole cutting of the cord

310.509 --> 316.78000000000003
and the traditional grid all the

312.729 --> 317.86
keywords you know so yeah I mean I just

316.78 --> 322.92999999999995
wonder how they're going to do this

317.86 --> 324.58000000000004
without satellites don't need it well I

322.93 --> 326.349
mean of course they're gonna still be

324.58 --> 327.46
clinging you know if yes the globe or

326.349 --> 329.46999999999997
they're gonna say this is all gonna be

327.46 --> 332.25
possible it sounds really good to me

329.47 --> 334.87
because this is a technological

332.25 --> 340.229
competition to the traditional cell

334.87 --> 344.26
phone towers and it's much cleaner yeah

340.229 --> 348.21
we from apply it that way the only

344.26 --> 348.21
problem I had with this company is

348.4 --> 359.92999999999995
okay we got here Michael Miller US Air

353.99 --> 365.21000000000004
Force yeah okay so they could probably

359.93 --> 367.85
double use it Richard Rowe US Air Force

365.21 --> 371.29999999999995
oh you know it's right it's probably

367.85 --> 373.67
gonna be a strategic hidden tool they

371.3 --> 377.48
can use for all kinds of things yes

373.67 --> 379.19
Tesla technology can but that doesn't

377.48 --> 381.59000000000003
mean we shouldn't use it for

379.19 --> 384.86
communications no but I would just like

381.59 --> 387.44
to wear like five systems and everything

384.86 --> 390.17
that is very damaging and this could

387.44 --> 391.76
solve that problem no I agree this

390.17 --> 393.98
there's good things but I just wonder

391.76 --> 395.09
like what a ball is gonna say like

393.98 --> 397.28000000000003
they're not there's nothing about

395.09 --> 399.77
satellites here and so how is this gonna

397.28 --> 401.63
work all all this wireless stuff is

399.77 --> 403.84999999999997
gonna work because of refraction I mean

401.63 --> 409.85
are they serious because they're

403.85 --> 413.27000000000004
counting probably on that I don't know

409.85 --> 418.76000000000005
it's just it's all stories you know the

413.27 --> 421.13
satellite thing and I they may if they

418.76 --> 423.62
get momentum as it worries if they

421.13 --> 427.01
become a thing then oh yeah definitely

423.62 --> 428.66
the satellite people will dive onto

427.01 --> 431.96
there and say yeah you're gonna have to

428.66 --> 434.45000000000005
incorporate satellites and then they'll

431.96 --> 437.71999999999997
just add it like okay yeah we also use

434.45 --> 440.06
satellites that's it that's what's gonna

437.72 --> 442.04
happen if it gets real momentum it's

440.06 --> 446.29
just not in there because it's very

442.04 --> 446.29
fresh hey Nathan

446.56 --> 459.89
what's up egg who's here that's Nathan

451.52 --> 464.29999999999995
Oakley well very well yeah early bird

459.89 --> 469.21
show right yes yes welcome I saw a

464.3 --> 473.06
picture was it that of drunk Apollo

469.21 --> 475.76
right there wasn't Larry's on yesterday

473.06 --> 477.86
he was chugging that beer like mad I was

475.76 --> 480.34999999999997
like oh my god you're drinking like it's

477.86 --> 481.97
Saturday night or something but in

480.35 --> 486.59000000000003
Sunday afternoon

481.97 --> 488.57000000000005
Nathan have you seen this yet I have yes

486.59 --> 494.9
yes if you looked at the company's

488.57 --> 496.90999999999997
website how many half paying attention

494.9 --> 500.47999999999996
because I'm thinking of macho that's

496.91 --> 502.49
cool no it r1 and I were just talking I

500.48 --> 504.08000000000004
mean they're talking about this cutting

502.49 --> 505.73
the cord and you know wireless

504.08 --> 507.32
communications of electricity all

505.73 --> 509.06
surface wave of course it's all gonna

507.32 --> 511.719
work I guess from refraction but there's

509.06 --> 514.909
no mention of satellites it's all

511.719 --> 519.53
surface around the world

514.909 --> 521.93
oh this is gonna sound pretty convoluted

519.53 --> 526.78
I win but I might as well explain though

521.93 --> 531.68
this bit is being recorded for the

526.78 --> 533.9
repeat of the after show first debate

531.68 --> 537.38
will go out live then the second debate

533.9 --> 541.85
live then this which is being recorded

537.38 --> 543.86
for me right now will go out and then

541.85 --> 546.0500000000001
it'll replay the debate that was first

543.86 --> 548.39
live does that make sense so in a minute

546.05 --> 551.06
I don't know if it'll work but I'm

548.39 --> 554.12
hoping I can multicast in other words

551.06 --> 556.2199999999999
while I'm on this call with you I can

554.12 --> 557.78
broadcast the earlybird show and you can

556.22 --> 561.88
plug the hell out of it to my audience

557.78 --> 561.88
while it's streaming that make sense

562.15 --> 571.1899999999999
yeah that's fine but yeah I think I get

568.43 --> 574.4
where you're going but it's a little

571.19 --> 575.9000000000001
hard to oversee just first plans what

574.4 --> 578.29
you're actually saying but yet you're

575.9 --> 581.11
gonna edit this into a pre-show I guess

578.29 --> 585.3199999999999
yeah old unfunny

581.11 --> 588.17
antony's got to say see if you can hear

585.32 --> 591.08
him I am see hang on link you sent me

588.17 --> 593.78
somebody I know it's empty because I've

591.08 --> 595.37
joined our window if Travis is gonna do

593.78 --> 597.62
the same and that's why he's he was in

595.37 --> 602.839
there it just kind of hold that hangout

597.62 --> 606.83
open all right stay it's up to you so I

602.839 --> 608.1500000000001
win can you hear Anthony yeah they well

606.83 --> 609.83
I should really Lance near then you're

608.15 --> 612.92
being broadcast on albuns channel so

609.83 --> 614.63
I've joined to our win so technically

612.92 --> 615.25
your conversation with me is also being

614.63 --> 617.35
broadcast

615.25 --> 624.61
should have said that first really okay

617.35 --> 625.9
hello guys sorry morning okay

624.61 --> 628.08
what are you gonna do then you want to

625.9 --> 630.9399999999999
just stay with me on skype for now and

628.08 --> 633.22
I'll start the debate and then while

630.94 --> 637.24
when our win finishes we'll just jump

633.22 --> 638.35
into my hangout which is open just stay

637.24 --> 640.09
on the call until you tell me to talk

638.35 --> 641.5600000000001
now just stay on the call yeah it's ugly

640.09 --> 643.6
to us say can you join the hangout that

641.56 --> 647.4399999999999
send you the link for oh let's talk

643.6 --> 649.72
about gravity here and your show into an

647.44 --> 655.96
administration affair for a first debate

649.72 --> 657.94
overload my bad someone casting on two

655.96 --> 659.62
channels that's gonna be a bit [ __ ] well

657.94 --> 661.69
I thought it would help our when in his

659.62 --> 663.16
audience as in third know that the early

661.69 --> 665.2
bird shows going on cuz obviously he'll

663.16 --> 666.9699999999999
be discussing it and it'd be something

665.2 --> 667.4200000000001
interesting to do for the 600th if it

666.97 --> 668.83
works

667.42 --> 670.93
providing everyone's cooperative

668.83 --> 672.0400000000001
everyone if anybody says no I'll just go

670.93 --> 674.56
now okay it's not that big a deal I

672.04 --> 676.12
think that I don't care just as long as

674.56 --> 680.6999999999999
we know what we're doing this fine yeah

676.12 --> 688.089
yeah yeah I'm pretty sure and I'll dude

680.7 --> 690.94
he says famous last words anything

688.089 --> 696.339
special planned for the 600 hey go see

690.94 --> 697.57
Brent going to his mentee right I'm

696.339 --> 699.69
gonna see if I can do it then I'll start

697.57 --> 705.7
shaking what are you gonna do for the

699.69 --> 706.6600000000001
666 show you're gonna skip that sliding

705.7 --> 708.88
over here

706.66 --> 711.8199999999999
it's gonna be the missing episode and

708.88 --> 712.45
then it's gonna pop up somewhere in in a

711.82 --> 715.24
few months

712.45 --> 723.88
yeah it's gonna be everyone acting all

715.24 --> 726.3100000000001
creepy and dressed up and maybe hey

723.88 --> 730.92
Travis Travis go live on my show so I'll

726.31 --> 735.18
so no pop you guys on meat hey guys

730.92 --> 735.18
hello sausage you're gonna come and do

738.57 --> 745.72
milkshake down you oh dear

742.44 --> 747.2900000000001
let's take that off you then pop it up

745.72 --> 750.28
here the way

747.29 --> 755.51
all right you wanna come and say hello

750.28 --> 771.26
you know you could say hello hello

755.51 --> 773.48
Eleanor yes okay was it heard of the art

771.26 --> 777.13
way did you heard of this zenyk wave

773.48 --> 780.23
before not that word No

777.13 --> 787.67
yo hey Jose Jose

780.23 --> 792.14
earlybird oh yeah number five it's

787.67 --> 795.17
getting crowded anyway what were we

792.14 --> 798.77
talking about yeah about the Tesla Tower

795.17 --> 800.02
and about the zenith wave it's very

798.77 --> 804.14
interesting

800.02 --> 809.24
yeah have you seen this Jose actually

804.14 --> 811.04
Jose here in Texas have you seen this

809.24 --> 815.53
Tesla tower that's been recently built

811.04 --> 821.15
in Texas no I haven't I have not seen

815.53 --> 825.23
yeah well just look up just Google Texas

821.15 --> 829.49
Tesla Tower and then search visit

825.23 --> 835.4300000000001
technology viz or Zed as some people say

829.49 --> 837.6800000000001
IV IV technologies yeah I was listening

835.43 --> 839.9499999999999
very interesting and yeah once I heard

837.68 --> 842.7199999999999
this I said yeah that's something that

839.95 --> 845.1800000000001
interests me and on research in a little

842.72 --> 847.7
bit and being out and looking around

845.18 --> 850.01
depends how far it is if it's close to

847.7 --> 851.5400000000001
the shore I might be able to see it we

850.01 --> 853.85
might feelings on different somewhere

851.54 --> 857.15
well their website is talking about all

853.85 --> 860.6
the cool trendy you know getting off the

857.15 --> 862.79
grid and you know wireless energy and

860.6 --> 865.28
helping the developing world you know

862.79 --> 866.5699999999999
global communications but it's

865.28 --> 870.53
interesting there's no mention of

866.57 --> 875.45
satellites or any orbital nonsense it's

870.53 --> 877.22
a pretty much line of sight so I guess

875.45 --> 879.23
you know the globe are gonna say this is

877.22 --> 879.57
all possible we're going to be possible

879.23 --> 881.76
because

879.57 --> 885.45
of refraction I suppose are gonna have

881.76 --> 886.1
to that's quite interesting is it light

885.45 --> 889.08
pace

886.1 --> 892.89
alright I think it is probably gonna

889.08 --> 894.72
grow high-voltage electrical based right

892.89 --> 896.55
yeah like they're sitting where is it

894.72 --> 899.9100000000001
you know well then light doesn't really

896.55 --> 902.28
have come into it where is it wireless

899.91 --> 904.29
power system will employ transmitter

902.28 --> 908.15
probe located near a power generation

904.29 --> 910.56
plan to launch a zenyk carrier wave

908.15 --> 913.11
receiver antenna will be positioned

910.56 --> 914.52
appropriately around the world stem too

913.11 --> 917.7
much now that we're actually live we

914.52 --> 919.62
shall see so I'm also joined on our wind

917.7 --> 922.6500000000001
show which is called the earlybird by

919.62 --> 923.67
Randy flat earth plain truth Jose Eric

922.65 --> 926.25
and of course

923.67 --> 929.0999999999999
Arwen himself so hello to my show and

926.25 --> 929.58
thank you for having me on yours hello

929.1 --> 933.66
Nathan

929.58 --> 955.6800000000001
yeah this is very interesting yeah we're

933.66 --> 958.4399999999999
joined by Nathan's hang out I guess not

955.68 --> 960.2099999999999
that video specifically I I saw it in a

958.44 --> 968.1300000000001
post I guess videos are coming at lips

960.21 --> 969.72
done which channel stop what stop okay

968.13 --> 979.59
oh it's a website okay

969.72 --> 981.0600000000001
is it a recent article or okay yeah

979.59 --> 982.5600000000001
we're just going through their website

981.06 --> 982.9499999999999
and just kind of looking what they're

982.56 --> 985.56
saying

982.95 --> 990.45
of course they use global and all that

985.56 --> 994.9799999999999
but yeah it it looks to me like they're

990.45 --> 999.2
basically applying well what we know as

994.98 --> 1002.87
a Wi-Fi system but based on a different

999.2 --> 1005.48
wavelength electromagnetic wavelength

1002.87 --> 1009.5600000000001
and that's a very smart thing to do

1005.48 --> 1011.63
although it all depends on current

1009.56 --> 1013.04
technology if that could be a problem

1011.63 --> 1017.75
because that technology

1013.04 --> 1020.36
is not based on this type of thing so it

1017.75 --> 1022.43
could disrupt that potentially it all

1020.36 --> 1024.319
depends on how they're going to approach

1022.43 --> 1027.98
it maybe they actually learned a way to

1024.319 --> 1029.569
bypass that problem well the other

1027.98 --> 1031.64
interesting part is I wonder if they're

1029.569 --> 1036.02
actually gonna using the ether the first

1031.64 --> 1039.5
paragraph on the about is our visit or

1036.02 --> 1042.319
visi whatever surface wave system allows

1039.5 --> 1044.179
the earth itself to be used for clean

1042.319 --> 1047.8899999999999
and efficient transfer of power between

1044.179 --> 1050.8700000000001
any two points on the globe wirelessly

1047.89 --> 1057.5200000000002
them what they mean by the earth they

1050.87 --> 1060.11
mm-hmm mm-hmm that's kind of interesting

1057.52 --> 1063.29
so the system represents a paradigm

1060.11 --> 1067.9699999999998
shift in the science of Aloha I think I

1063.29 --> 1073.04
get what they're going for because

1067.97 --> 1076.82
magnetic waves are technically not like

1073.04 --> 1080.12
absorbs by rock they can transcend

1076.82 --> 1081.86
everything so maybe they're suggesting

1080.12 --> 1083.51
they're just beaming it right through

1081.86 --> 1085.4599999999998
the earth to the other sides kind of a

1083.51 --> 1087.559
bit complicated when there's a molten

1085.46 --> 1092.24
iron magnetic core spinning in the way

1087.559 --> 1094.7
but yeah maybe they're just are they

1092.24 --> 1098.21
suggesting that I could maybe maybe they

1094.7 --> 1099.559
are already may I think these guys are

1098.21 --> 1102.02
really smart and I think they already

1099.559 --> 1103.6399999999999
know what's going on what is the

1102.02 --> 1106.37
paradigm is going to shift I think they

1103.64 --> 1110.0300000000002
probably have already adapted to like a

1106.37 --> 1112.1499999999999
future narrative where the music this is

1110.03 --> 1114.799
suggesting that they can beam

1112.15 --> 1117.02
electricity and or telecommunication

1114.799 --> 1122.24
waves like through a mountain range from

1117.02 --> 1125.9
one yeah unless it is a highly

1122.24 --> 1129.35
magnetized rock unless there is a

1125.9 --> 1131.65
disruption that can beam through

1129.35 --> 1131.6499999999999
anything

1134.409 --> 1142.7600000000002
hello MC this is the first sentence just

1139.79 --> 1146.26
really has a lot of vague interesting

1142.76 --> 1146.26
you know allows the earth itself

1147.78 --> 1157.18
not saying the atmosphere not saying I

1152.53 --> 1159.34
don't know I mean right well maybe they

1157.18 --> 1161.71
suggest that the earth is used as a

1159.34 --> 1163.6299999999999
conduit I don't know but it's to me it's

1161.71 --> 1167.14
kind of obvious they're suggesting they

1163.63 --> 1168.91
literally can beam it through anything

1167.14 --> 1172.8100000000002
so mountain ranges won't be an obstacle

1168.91 --> 1175.93
and they could potentially just beam it

1172.81 --> 1178.1799999999998
right through bball earth if somebody

1175.93 --> 1183.19
needs to imagine that it would be

1178.18 --> 1185.14
evolved see the other thing is currently

1183.19 --> 1187.0900000000001
a research and commercialization efforts

1185.14 --> 1189.7900000000002
are focused on energy transfer and

1187.09 --> 1191.08
communications but this is the important

1189.79 --> 1194.3799999999999
part but we recognize that this

1191.08 --> 1196.6299999999999
technology has the potential to impact

1194.38 --> 1199.8000000000002
numerous sectors of the economy so it's

1196.63 --> 1204.49
good an but you know a lot of job just

1199.8 --> 1207.58
placement and Wow it will impact a huge

1204.49 --> 1210.34
market yeah and all the scams in these

1207.58 --> 1212.3799999999999
markets and think of all the wireline

1210.34 --> 1217.9199999999998
stay where I'll be weekend is exactly

1212.38 --> 1220.0300000000002
what the legend of Tesla is all about so

1217.92 --> 1223.75
yeah they're gonna have to get some

1220.03 --> 1228.01
serious green lights go and some support

1223.75 --> 1230.65
wide supports or a uniform plan for the

1228.01 --> 1233.32
energy industry to transit that they've

1230.65 --> 1235.24
been ordered by the elite or they're

1233.32 --> 1236.86
just saying like look you know what we

1235.24 --> 1239.53
can still make a profit this way and

1236.86 --> 1243.1
we'll be much more efficient much less

1239.53 --> 1245.5
stressful it'll work out because that's

1243.1 --> 1248.23
what they do that's what the elites the

1245.5 --> 1250.75
controllers the the power-hungry really

1248.23 --> 1252.79
care about that they keep some level of

1250.75 --> 1254.74
control they don't mind progress as long

1252.79 --> 1258.1
as they don't lose their grip in the

1254.74 --> 1262.39
process so maybe this is just like okay

1258.1 --> 1265.57
we're gonna go step forward we're gonna

1262.39 --> 1269.4
try this now and and we think we can

1265.57 --> 1271.75
control it basically so interesting and

1269.4 --> 1276.46
good I'm very happy about it

1271.75 --> 1278.98
I hate Wi-Fi and all that [ __ ] it

1276.46 --> 1280.01
affects me very badly I am sensitive to

1278.98 --> 1283.67
that stuff so

1280.01 --> 1288.46
be very happy if a system based on this

1283.67 --> 1291.2
would replace that yeah no I mean uh

1288.46 --> 1292.88
here's another thing they put two they

1291.2 --> 1296.98
said this wireless power system will

1292.88 --> 1299.0
employ a quote transmitter probe

1296.98 --> 1300.8600000000001
transmitters usually are stationary

1299.0 --> 1304.1
whatwhat's and what do you think they

1300.86 --> 1308.99
mean by a probe probe flies like well

1304.1 --> 1311.36
maybe they're gonna dig down on a

1308.99 --> 1313.88
transmitter probe located and every

1311.36 --> 1319.28
power generation plant that's another

1313.88 --> 1321.8600000000001
like what coal steam nuclear I don't

1319.28 --> 1324.29
know wind right yeah it's gonna have

1321.86 --> 1325.6999999999998
yeah like the electricity doesn't come

1324.29 --> 1328.55
out of nothing it still has to be

1325.7 --> 1330.6200000000001
generated but it is so much more

1328.55 --> 1333.86
efficient than using power lines and

1330.62 --> 1337.52
such so much more efficient so if this

1333.86 --> 1342.6499999999999
is gonna work out then it will

1337.52 --> 1346.19
inevitably be followed up by using it

1342.65 --> 1350.24
for regular power as well because it'll

1346.19 --> 1351.53
save so much so much costs you know but

1350.24 --> 1354.02
for these glue I mean shouldn't these

1351.53 --> 1355.7
glow bursts art start seeing the writing

1354.02 --> 1357.53
on the wall like you know they're all

1355.7 --> 1359.03
into science and tech and yet I mean

1357.53 --> 1362.09
look look at this stuff there's nothing

1359.03 --> 1364.49
about orbital mechanics and it doesn't

1362.09 --> 1366.35
need it I just told you I know well

1364.49 --> 1372.77
coming through the earth it doesn't need

1366.35 --> 1374.4499999999998
to be brought up very simple so I went

1372.77 --> 1376.01
in about five minutes

1374.45 --> 1377.93
about half past I'm gonna drop from this

1376.01 --> 1379.1299999999999
hangout and disappear but why you've got

1377.93 --> 1382.51
the year of my audience you might as

1379.13 --> 1384.17
well plug the early bird show explain

1382.51 --> 1389.99
okay thanks

1384.17 --> 1393.41
yeah the early bird show this is episode

1389.99 --> 1395.75
five now it's an open panel but only two

1393.41 --> 1398.26
people that I trust although I have no

1395.75 --> 1401.9
control over who you bring with you on

1398.26 --> 1404.54
skype so it's basically a Google

1401.9 --> 1408.5600000000002
Hangouts based very basic system I get

1404.54 --> 1411.4099999999999
in people basically by invite you have

1408.56 --> 1413.69
to add me on skype and if I prefer I

1411.41 --> 1416.8700000000001
will give you the link

1413.69 --> 1418.49
through skype and yet it's an open show

1416.87 --> 1422.57
it's not really a debate show it's just

1418.49 --> 1424.43
an open minded early-morning talk what's

1422.57 --> 1429.86
on your heart or on your mind or what

1424.43 --> 1431.48
have you dreamt about show so yeah early

1429.86 --> 1433.2199999999998
breakfast show that's how I really

1431.48 --> 1437.41
regard this you can just sit together

1433.22 --> 1437.41
and just have good conversations and

1438.82 --> 1454.85
sorry I didn't get that sorry crafted a

1451.91 --> 1457.66
feel better you might want to turn

1454.85 --> 1460.58
Travis up oh you mean a better riddle

1457.66 --> 1464.0600000000002
sorry I'm not I'll never be as good as

1460.58 --> 1466.1299999999999
Nathan is in this intro it thank you

1464.06 --> 1469.19
over here yeah but you're so disciplined

1466.13 --> 1471.38
it's it's like a perfect tape and you

1469.19 --> 1476.78
even have like improvisation so you made

1471.38 --> 1479.93
an art out of it I'm just I just

1476.78 --> 1481.67
improvise basically everything almost

1479.93 --> 1484.16
everything you're better we thought I

1481.67 --> 1488.99
wouldn't you better we start Nathan is

1484.16 --> 1491.95
just a magician yeah but my magic lies

1488.99 --> 1495.32
in my improvisation not in my

1491.95 --> 1498.68
repetitiveness so can you spell the name

1495.32 --> 1502.9399999999998
of your channel yeah so trick Flat Earth

1498.68 --> 1511.19
early-bird the channel Oh my channel

1502.94 --> 1515.68
name is our win a are WI JN and you'll

1511.19 --> 1518.47
recognize me by my tree icon

1515.68 --> 1521.21
so yeah please subscribe to my channel

1518.47 --> 1524.15
you can also find me of course on the

1521.21 --> 1528.47
Flat Earth debates where I join

1524.15 --> 1532.6100000000001
regularly on the panel like a plague to

1528.47 --> 1535.3700000000001
some and yeah I now do this early bird

1532.61 --> 1538.81
show a one hour before the debate

1535.37 --> 1538.81
standard which would be

1539.199 --> 1549.3200000000002
two o'clock GMT plus 1 or Amsterdam time

1544.899 --> 1552.2289999999998
and I think it's one o'clock British

1549.32 --> 1554.349
time that's great right so one o'clock

1552.229 --> 1557.209
British time pretty much every day

1554.349 --> 1559.4589999999998
unless something happens and I'm delayed

1557.209 --> 1563.1490000000001
or anything but that's the plan I'm

1559.459 --> 1564.459
gonna do that every day and see how it

1563.149 --> 1568.2489999999998
goes

1564.459 --> 1570.289
stuff well I'm straight away to answer

1568.249 --> 1572.499
they are spoiling for a row I can feel

1570.289 --> 1572.499
it

1579.549 --> 1584.179
Nathan Whitcomb mute I don't know maybe

1581.929 --> 1585.979
they are we're gonna do this purely on

1584.179 --> 1588.499
their show a year if any of you guys

1585.979 --> 1591.529
want to join they're like Randy I can

1588.499 --> 1595.039
imagine you want to be there or any of

1591.529 --> 1599.149
you that's fine hey check out this I

1595.039 --> 1600.859
found one a video for the zenyk wave of

1599.149 --> 1604.879
course there's gonna still sell this

1600.859 --> 1608.559
bending hmm low frequency wavelengths

1604.879 --> 1608.559
appear her to bend around the earth

1610.719 --> 1620.299
that's our based it's an ARB a straight

1614.599 --> 1629.859
line so our solves everything look at

1620.299 --> 1629.859
this where you get your look at this we

1632.379 --> 1639.4689999999998
are we need Riley's live on Nathan

1636.409 --> 1641.979
talking about the plan does he what he's

1639.469 --> 1647.979
gonna talk about in the next hour or so

1641.979 --> 1647.979
about the personal attacks on this life

1649.329 --> 1654.829
he's talking about and then so we are

1651.889 --> 1656.4489999999998
over here kind of just brainstorming so

1654.829 --> 1658.399
you off to you guys you can choose to

1656.449 --> 1660.5890000000002
stay here and talk about random subjects

1658.399 --> 1661.7589999999998
or you can go over there and kind of

1660.589 --> 1666.799
just piss off

1661.759 --> 1668.3890000000001
Riley okay I'll go and listen to what

1666.799 --> 1670.399
he's got to say over there then guys and

1668.389 --> 1671.76
I'll leave you guys to this all right

1670.399 --> 1677.4299999999998
thank you

1671.76 --> 1679.5
Randy yeah see you later this is just

1677.43 --> 1682.41
Ludacris they I mean look at their art

1679.5 --> 1684.48
the little station beaming stuff and

1682.41 --> 1689.91
then it just it just has to bend doesn't

1684.48 --> 1691.8
it are based are based imaginings it's

1689.91 --> 1693.5700000000002
very easy to do is just you take the

1691.8 --> 1694.71
normal world and then you just wrap it

1693.57 --> 1699.48
around the ball

1694.71 --> 1702.3500000000001
whatever you doing their own video nice

1699.48 --> 1702.35
snapshot there

1711.81 --> 1717.8999999999999
I wonder how many people I mean you look

1714.03 --> 1721.35
at these guys and not thumbs they've got

1717.9 --> 1723.24
it but they are upholding of course they

1721.35 --> 1726.32
know they're upholding the narrative and

1723.24 --> 1729.74
they're just trying to apply technology

1726.32 --> 1729.74
into that narrative

1729.89 --> 1733.7700000000002
well it'll be easy

1731.85 --> 1736.53
look if they can transfer through

1733.77 --> 1739.56
mountains and through Rock especially

1736.53 --> 1744.87
then it's gonna be very easy to reason

1739.56 --> 1747.33
out how it can work and the way I think

1744.87 --> 1749.28
it's a good development and I really

1747.33 --> 1750.8
really hope they don't abuse start

1749.28 --> 1755.46
abusing it right away

1750.8 --> 1757.6499999999999
well yeah if you look at companies if

1755.46 --> 1759.93
you look at their uh I mean not only are

1757.65 --> 1763.2900000000002
the US Air Force but they work to think

1759.93 --> 1765.18
I saw one was like either BP or shell so

1763.29 --> 1767.6399999999999
they're all from thee but they will

1765.18 --> 1769.8600000000001
definitely need to be involved because

1767.64 --> 1772.74
if you're gonna apply this it's gonna

1769.86 --> 1777.09
affect a lot of what goes on in the air

1772.74 --> 1779.46
so it needs to be synchronized with with

1777.09 --> 1781.98
air situations with airplanes and

1779.46 --> 1783.72
everything because if there's no

1781.98 --> 1786.06
oversight then they could trigger

1783.72 --> 1789.09
accidents or whatever they're not

1786.06 --> 1790.98
careful so of course the Air Force will

1789.09 --> 1794.37
be cooperating with them at least

1790.98 --> 1798.0
although seems that it's mostly just Air

1794.37 --> 1800.3999999999999
Force personnel that are running in well

1798.0 --> 1803.34
I mean two of the four minutes see I

1800.4 --> 1808.92
don't know hmm alright you know there's

1803.34 --> 1814.1
a lot of MIT Air Force kau capstone

1808.92 --> 1814.1000000000001
that's a capstone technologies

1817.88 --> 1823.3500000000001
isn't that brownstone capstone come on

1821.52 --> 1828.92
dude capstone technology what do you

1823.35 --> 1828.9199999999998
think that refers to pyramid Capstone's

1832.1 --> 1837.1499999999999
and then we have these uh gen you know

1834.96 --> 1840.45
this retired general air force he was in

1837.15 --> 1843.679
ballistic missiles and

1840.45 --> 1853.8590000000002
oh he was in health care administration

1843.679 --> 1856.23
Wow right yeah I don't know I just don't

1853.859 --> 1863.34
like I don't like to see these of these

1856.23 --> 1866.759
oh Sh Everett Chevron man there's a lot

1863.34 --> 1869.789
of people or anyway most of these people

1866.759 --> 1874.169
are bound to be all over the place

1869.789 --> 1877.799
company wise but they're certainly not

1874.169 --> 1883.529
like some anonymous new group sprouting

1877.799 --> 1886.35
out of nothing that's restricting yeah I

1883.529 --> 1889.98
don't know I mean I won't say that this

1886.35 --> 1893.82
is an evil company now doesn't need to

1889.98 --> 1896.6390000000001
be like every organization big military

1893.82 --> 1898.529
has good people in it I'm convinced but

1896.639 --> 1902.85
you see we should definitely keep a

1898.529 --> 1905.909
close eye on what they're doing and keep

1902.85 --> 1909.1789999999999
track that they don't start to have like

1905.909 --> 1912.1190000000001
weird meetings or we don't want to find

1909.179 --> 1918.69
these people at Bilderberg meetings for

1912.119 --> 1921.6899999999998
example I mean we want to hear what you

1918.69 --> 1924.6490000000001
know they're still putting you know cut

1921.69 --> 1927.8690000000001
the cord off the grid you know all the

1924.649 --> 1935.2199999999998
eco-friendly marketing terms but they're

1927.869 --> 1938.279
still using globe in here planet yeah

1935.22 --> 1940.259
come on that's logical this is funny

1938.279 --> 1941.609
just listen to this when launched it's

1940.259 --> 1943.739
funny that think it's like they're gonna

1941.609 --> 1945.809
turn on a button in it like that so it's

1943.739 --> 1948.6290000000001
listen to this when launched the zenyk

1945.809 --> 1952.139
surface wave literally envelops the

1948.629 --> 1954.029
planet like a balloon enabling

1952.139 --> 1957.029
transmitter probes to be placed anywhere

1954.029 --> 1960.929
power can be generated and receivers to

1957.029 --> 1964.32
be placed anywhere powers ended it

1960.929 --> 1966.3300000000002
envelops the planet I thought that

1964.32 --> 1968.97
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] I mean I just

1966.33 --> 1970.71
picture in my mind like this blue label

1968.97 --> 1974.4
on that wrap around the earth you know

1970.71 --> 1978.42
how big of a scale that little thing is

1974.4 --> 1981.96
it depends on how strong it could be so

1978.42 --> 1984.51
I I don't I don't exclude the

1981.96 --> 1988.2
possibility although wrapping around the

1984.51 --> 1991.14
planet or basically being so broad in

1988.2 --> 1995.72
its magnetic wave that it will cover the

1991.14 --> 1999.63
entire looping confined space

1995.72 --> 2001.58
I personally if I think about it like if

1999.63 --> 2003.3200000000002
it's possible or not is just a material

2001.58 --> 2006.4099999999999
that's gonna take you know how much

2003.32 --> 2008.12
material to put your pore up there you

2006.41 --> 2011.99
know to build this is just it's already

2008.12 --> 2016.07
built it's already built there's

2011.99 --> 2018.6200000000001
pictures of it yeah I mean the type that

2016.07 --> 2020.1799999999998
hard it it's really basic it doesn't

2018.62 --> 2023.2399999999998
require a lot of material and doesn't

2020.18 --> 2025.49
even require a lot of fossil fuel to

2023.24 --> 2031.22
fuel this thing that's the the crazy

2025.49 --> 2033.56
thing about it out put a lot of energy I

2031.22 --> 2035.39
was picturing something else like a

2033.56 --> 2038.96
balloon that is gonna wrap around the

2035.39 --> 2041.0600000000002
earth you know like a physical now they

2038.96 --> 2043.79
suggest the energy wraps around the

2041.06 --> 2045.35
world yeah that it's a that it's a

2043.79 --> 2048.14
system that it's gonna like they're

2045.35 --> 2051.14
gonna push the on button it's so sighted

2048.14 --> 2054.25
so you know what is it

2051.14 --> 2056.69
Skynet like when when it goes on loving

2054.25 --> 2059.96
what its gonna do if it's just gonna be

2056.69 --> 2063.98
energy mostly that is really good it

2059.96 --> 2067.34
could have a pyramid effect you know

2063.98 --> 2070.1
what I mean because high electric high

2067.34 --> 2074.6000000000004
voltage electric fields have direct

2070.1 --> 2077.87
beneficial influence on life so yeah

2074.6 --> 2080.149
that is kind of it so can't wait to see

2077.87 --> 2082.19
the effects although I do really really

2080.149 --> 2085.97
hope they haven't screwed with it and

2082.19 --> 2089.51
start to tune in some bad frequencies or

2085.97 --> 2093.169
whatever really but we would notice very

2089.51 --> 2095.21
quickly because this stuff is is that it

2093.169 --> 2097.79
will be everywhere if it's in the air I

2095.21 --> 2099.89
kind of overlooked an article that this

2097.79 --> 2102.35
Feige they were doing some testing and

2099.89 --> 2104.5699999999997
he'd killed like a bunch of other thing

2102.35 --> 2106.52
it was birds or something like that in a

2104.57 --> 2108.1400000000003
very in a closed room environment and

2106.52 --> 2109.91
they would testing

2108.14 --> 2111.7999999999997
some frequencies on the five year and

2109.91 --> 2115.04
and the birds where girl associate I did

2111.8 --> 2120.2000000000003
yeah but 5g is basically a microwave

2115.04 --> 2125.6
very very powerful open microwave so

2120.2 --> 2128.48
yeah it's pure damage it's like that

2125.6 --> 2134.9
form of telecommunications should just

2128.48 --> 2137.0
go away like asbestos yeah and the thing

2134.9 --> 2138.7400000000002
about this is just a bunch of relays you

2137.0 --> 2140.99
know a bunch of rip is repeated or just

2138.74 --> 2143.1499999999996
like little antennas that stick up every

2140.99 --> 2145.8799999999997
other house you know so we can have that

2143.15 --> 2148.1600000000003
net that web everywhere and the closest

2145.88 --> 2149.51
a secret you know from little tower to

2148.16 --> 2151.0899999999997
tower which is gonna be every other

2149.51 --> 2153.32
house then we got the powerful

2151.09 --> 2156.98
connection but that's going to be pure

2153.32 --> 2158.48
energy and freaking beams like shooting

2156.98 --> 2161.6
around you know the whole area so we can

2158.48 --> 2163.85
get and we were absorbing the human body

2161.6 --> 2166.16
is going to absorb everything that's

2163.85 --> 2170.21
gonna be transmitted from those little

2166.16 --> 2172.91
repetitive some towers I'm looking at

2170.21 --> 2175.19
this and I'm just thinking of the what's

2172.91 --> 2176.96
in the chemtrails and the vaccines and

2175.19 --> 2180.28
the food and they launch this and it's

2176.96 --> 2184.85
you know the human body has increased

2180.28 --> 2187.52
metallic conductive thing I don't know I

2184.85 --> 2191.21
just microwaves and Active Denial

2187.52 --> 2194.5099999999998
systems and microwave is bad because it

2191.21 --> 2197.53
destroys cells it overheats literally

2194.51 --> 2200.6000000000004
and it disrupts genetic function but

2197.53 --> 2205.88
high voltage electricity doesn't do that

2200.6 --> 2208.13
it actually helps clean up your your

2205.88 --> 2209.03
system on a cellular level it's

2208.13 --> 2212.15
incredible

2209.03 --> 2215.32
this really is beneficial if they use it

2212.15 --> 2219.82
properly without any screwing around

2215.32 --> 2221.84
because I yeah to break it to you

2219.82 --> 2224.81
potentially this technology can also be

2221.84 --> 2228.02
used for very direct mind control as far

2224.81 --> 2230.12
as I can remember but that will be very

2228.02 --> 2233.29
obvious and once that starts to happen

2230.12 --> 2236.9
then everyone will crack down on it

2233.29 --> 2239.21
thanks to the social media because

2236.9 --> 2241.46
everyone will catch on even far away and

2239.21 --> 2244.849
alarm will be sound

2241.46 --> 2247.54
so but that kid so many things can be

2244.849 --> 2250.28
done with Tesla technology it's insane

2247.54 --> 2254.15
let's just hope they keep it normal

2250.28 --> 2256.1600000000003
don't go any crazy evil plans with it

2254.15 --> 2260.65
and then it will be a great benefit to

2256.16 --> 2267.14
the world in my opinion

2260.65 --> 2269.42
hey so I've got somewhat of a wild hair

2267.14 --> 2271.73
crazy idea I've talked to you know some

2269.42 --> 2275.75
of you in terms of having interviews and

2271.73 --> 2280.01
whatnot Eric and Marwan and so I've got

2275.75 --> 2281.9
just Red Hen radio.com set up its just

2280.01 --> 2284.8900000000003
bare bones I've got red head and radio

2281.9 --> 2290.329
channel on YouTube but I'm looking to do

2284.89 --> 2291.2
alternate recording and research and you

2290.329 --> 2295.329
guys would be I think would be

2291.2 --> 2298.7
interesting to have little tiny

2295.329 --> 2300.53
infomercials where we you know talk

2298.7 --> 2303.109
about this stuff I'm trying I'm trying

2300.53 --> 2305.3590000000004
number at you cuz I'm I have discussions

2303.109 --> 2310.42
with liberal friends that absolutely

2305.359 --> 2316.0099999999998
just hate anything with alternate news

2310.42 --> 2319.16
so sad I just try to think how how can

2316.01 --> 2324.849
we how can we present this information

2319.16 --> 2329.2
in a respectable way with with with

2324.849 --> 2332.569
responsible research and well-crafted

2329.2 --> 2334.16
journalism and so I'm just thinking the

2332.569 --> 2336.14
stuff we're talking about I think is is

2334.16 --> 2337.3999999999996
stuff that we need to present I'm not

2336.14 --> 2339.5589999999997
sure that it's being presented on other

2337.4 --> 2341.809
channels as well but I think the more

2339.559 --> 2344.869
that we expose these things in a

2341.809 --> 2349.0400000000004
respectable responsible and not a

2344.869 --> 2350.75
tinfoil hat way so with that with that

2349.04 --> 2352.64
planted in your minds if you think of

2350.75 --> 2356.72
any way that you could or would want to

2352.64 --> 2359.48
contribute to the Red Hen radio platform

2356.72 --> 2361.819
you know let's start and you're saying

2359.48 --> 2365.119
you want to kind of appeal a bit to the

2361.819 --> 2368.599
let's say liberal that that sort of

2365.119 --> 2370.6400000000003
thing as well yeah yeah I want them to

2368.599 --> 2373.2200000000003
have my channel come up in their feed

2370.64 --> 2375.29
and the topic is there and there so

2373.22 --> 2378.3199999999997
they're gonna look up Tesla or you know

2375.29 --> 2381.62
we've got an article or an episode on on

2378.32 --> 2383.9300000000003
Tesla technology and we're doing you

2381.62 --> 2385.67
know responsible journalism and I'm

2383.93 --> 2387.77
trying to think of it as being just

2385.67 --> 2389.9
small little infomercials nothing

2387.77 --> 2395.81
extensive nothing long I mean it can get

2389.9 --> 2398.03
that way yeah sure I'm game like no yeah

2395.81 --> 2400.49
that sounds like a good chest I think

2398.03 --> 2402.6200000000003
it's it's gonna be hard because I I

2400.49 --> 2406.3999999999996
don't know if even call them liberal but

2402.62 --> 2408.5899999999997
they're so locked into this science of

2406.4 --> 2412.76
the globe is dying and you know gender

2408.59 --> 2417.44
is a rainbow and anything just I don't

2412.76 --> 2421.28
know it's well like for instance like

2417.44 --> 2423.92
for instance I'm I'm just twenty thirty

2421.28 --> 2426.2900000000004
thirty minutes away from the shootings

2423.92 --> 2431.12
that happened earlier this week right or

2426.29 --> 2434.06
let this weekend when is it yeah and

2431.12 --> 2436.64
I've got friends that are are saying

2434.06 --> 2439.0099999999998
that they know the families they know

2436.64 --> 2441.2
the child that got shot and killed and

2439.01 --> 2442.88
whatnot and so I'm just thinking honor

2441.2 --> 2444.97
no maybe should I should I Drive up

2442.88 --> 2447.7400000000002
there and just do some investigative

2444.97 --> 2449.9599999999996
snooping around and just go to the local

2447.74 --> 2453.8599999999997
like find out where the location was

2449.96 --> 2456.08
find the nearest hospital and then just

2453.86 --> 2458.1200000000003
walk in and say hey I'm just doing some

2456.08 --> 2459.83
investigative reporting can you just

2458.12 --> 2462.56
tell me how many of the victims were

2459.83 --> 2469.16
brought here Oh none okay or whatever

2462.56 --> 2471.7999999999997
you know yeah detective work so post

2469.16 --> 2473.8999999999996
that you're gonna get into you're gonna

2471.8 --> 2480.8
eventually bump into people stopping you

2473.9 --> 2482.7200000000003
though yeah you know they lock it down

2480.8 --> 2486.5
they lock down the narrative really do

2482.72 --> 2493.31
that no I don't talk to anybody about

2486.5 --> 2495.95
this if you go to the hospital and they

2493.31 --> 2498.08
say I'm sorry we cannot we cannot

2495.95 --> 2499.25
comment on it we would have anything we

2498.08 --> 2501.3199999999997
don't have anything to say okay thank

2499.25 --> 2503.51
you you know what that tells more than

2501.32 --> 2505.4900000000002
if they say no we don't have nobody oh

2503.51 --> 2507.2000000000003
yes we did have one or two patients you

2505.49 --> 2509.0899999999997
know coming from the shooting so if they

2507.2 --> 2511.64
say I cannot talk about it that's it

2509.09 --> 2513.11
the big tally that somebody is getting

2511.64 --> 2515.06
into them and he said you don't talk

2513.11 --> 2529.67
about this you know either way either

2515.06 --> 2532.91
way all right yeah hey so what do you

2529.67 --> 2534.56
guys think about so some of the feedback

2532.91 --> 2537.64
that I've gotten on my videos that I put

2534.56 --> 2542.48
up for the angle of resolution shots is

2537.64 --> 2547.5499999999997
that even the one channel belief is that

2542.48 --> 2551.2400000000002
thief is saying that warehouses like

2547.55 --> 2553.1600000000003
wal-mart are not leveling their floors

2551.24 --> 2556.37
he said you know he said that it's too

2553.16 --> 2559.42
expensive to make it that precise you

2556.37 --> 2561.92
know obviously the floor has got some

2559.42 --> 2564.29
some rising and falling they're not say

2561.92 --> 2568.58
he belief as a thief wasn't saying that

2564.29 --> 2570.41
was curving but I mean just what's your

2568.58 --> 2571.61
initial thought on that my initial

2570.41 --> 2572.96
thought is did just say that's total

2571.61 --> 2575.03
[ __ ] there's just no way they're

2572.96 --> 2577.9700000000003
gonna level the whole thing out well it

2575.03 --> 2579.7400000000002
is all relative because one is level it

2577.97 --> 2584.66
doesn't mean it's on the millimeter

2579.74 --> 2586.3399999999997
accurate or centimeter you know so if

2584.66 --> 2590.3599999999997
it's gonna be one centimeter that's

2586.34 --> 2592.4300000000003
still not gonna be yeah you can consider

2590.36 --> 2596.1200000000003
that curvature or anything or because of

2592.43 --> 2599.87
the obstruction so yeah maybe it's like

2596.12 --> 2602.12
not perfectly flat it's like with

2599.87 --> 2605.5299999999997
wobbliness of a centimeter or whatever

2602.12 --> 2610.7
that still that kind of matter over like

2605.53 --> 2611.9900000000002
hundreds of meters distance yeah so I

2610.7 --> 2614.81
don't know if you saw the two different

2611.99 --> 2617.4199999999996
the two different episodes that I put up

2614.81 --> 2621.14
the first one that I put up I had the

2617.42 --> 2624.17
camera on its side and then the second

2621.14 --> 2626.8399999999997
one I had the camera upside down and it

2624.17 --> 2633.86
was a closer it was closer to the floor

2626.84 --> 2638.53
and the very first light drop that I did

2633.86 --> 2641.7200000000003
about 20 25 feet away was obscured so

2638.53 --> 2642.8900000000003
the side view camera you could go at

2641.72 --> 2649.339
least seven

2642.89 --> 2654.5589999999997
five yards but the upside down view

2649.339 --> 2657.89
I lost the light within I don't know

2654.559 --> 2665.599
eight 18 yards no that's that's too much

2657.89 --> 2667.94
what's 3 feet per yard into 26 yards so

2665.599 --> 2670.4300000000003
I don't know I thought that was

2667.94 --> 2674.569
interesting I forgot how many feet is a

2670.43 --> 2677.45
yard I always meters for things now 3 3

2674.569 --> 2679.579
feet yeah 3 feet is the our thoughts

2677.45 --> 2681.74
they fix yards so that's about 20 feet

2679.579 --> 2684.6800000000003
so actually yard and eaters about the

2681.74 --> 2687.589
same then pretty much yeah as another

2684.68 --> 2692.8089999999997
meter three point three yeah I mean yeah

2687.589 --> 2694.94
three to eight or something I hate I

2692.809 --> 2700.19
hate I hate the Royal what do you call

2694.94 --> 2703.849
it the traction yeah no no meters I use

2700.19 --> 2706.76
I just the what do we call that we use

2703.849 --> 2713.65
here it's the Royal it's not feet what

2706.76 --> 2715.48
do we call the system British first is

2713.65 --> 2717.71
[Music]

2715.48 --> 2719.509
what I hate about it is that Rory's

2717.71 --> 2721.73
fraction it's like what the heck's an

2719.509 --> 2723.17
inch and five-eighths like why don't you

2721.73 --> 2726.349
just choose millimeters and centimeters

2723.17 --> 2728.4500000000003
geez so much I don't yeah I don't like

2726.349 --> 2730.13
centimeters or millimeters it's gotta be

2728.45 --> 2733.46
in chief and quarter of an inch eighth

2730.13 --> 2735.1400000000003
of an inch yeah yeah like fractions the

2733.46 --> 2737.059
ledger like it just makes no I don't

2735.14 --> 2738.71
know it's yeah those are make sense to

2737.059 --> 2742.19
me that's that's the way to break an

2738.71 --> 2744.89
inch in pieces in a court and eight it's

2742.19 --> 2748.9700000000003
caught guys it's called a customary unit

2744.89 --> 2752.8689999999997
a metric versus customary something

2748.97 --> 2754.6699999999996
British royal or something like it's

2752.869 --> 2757.4900000000002
customary it's good literally that's

2754.67 --> 2759.17
what it's called but as opposed to that

2757.49 --> 2761.18
that's why I use that's why I use

2759.17 --> 2762.38
Fahrenheit as opposed to Celsius it's

2761.18 --> 2763.759
just there's more notch it's more

2762.38 --> 2768.559
precise you not I mean

2763.759 --> 2771.68
thank wait I went yesterday I'll ferry

2768.559 --> 2773.9900000000002
and I put a little live stream as I went

2771.68 --> 2775.43
in there little in the boat we parked

2773.99 --> 2776.8799999999997
the car inside and we went to the other

2775.43 --> 2778.56
side but it was

2776.88 --> 2782.55
really cool I did the livestream with my

2778.56 --> 2784.35
phone first and it was just John shaky

2782.55 --> 2786.15
and you can see all the boom I mean the

2784.35 --> 2787.56
parallax and the boats and the little of

2786.15 --> 2790.8
city coming from the other side was

2787.56 --> 2792.75
really cool I took I took my pin hundred

2790.8 --> 2794.2200000000003
four videos but it was sprinkling rain

2792.75 --> 2795.96
so I didn't want to damage it

2794.22 --> 2797.97
and that's in the in the livestream

2795.96 --> 2801.33
before I was with my p900 my niece was

2797.97 --> 2803.64
shooting the the phone for YouTube and I

2801.33 --> 2805.5299999999997
was like I'm gonna put my pin 100 in my

2803.64 --> 2807.96
pocket I have the big the hoodie

2805.53 --> 2809.82
sweatshirt pocket but then when I came

2807.96 --> 2811.44
back I got into the ferry and I shoot

2809.82 --> 2813.54
around with the pin and hundred few

2811.44 --> 2815.4900000000002
little videos and when I was in the

2813.54 --> 2816.96
other side I took some footage from the

2815.49 --> 2821.1299999999997
other side to the other Shores to the

2816.96 --> 2824.31
buildings and but it was so cloudy and

2821.13 --> 2826.8900000000003
so misty I don't think I was able I mean

2824.31 --> 2829.14
I know I wasn't able to see that far but

2826.89 --> 2831.15
still there were some buildings far

2829.14 --> 2833.04
[ __ ] far in the distance you know you

2831.15 --> 2834.9
can see just kind of just a out shape

2833.04 --> 2836.25
outline I don't know what they were

2834.9 --> 2838.77
because I was in a totally different

2836.25 --> 2840.36
place totally different view you know I

2838.77 --> 2842.49
wasn't I don't know if I was looking at

2840.36 --> 2844.9500000000003
the big downtown in Houston Texas

2842.49 --> 2847.2599999999998
because I was freaking over here like 25

2844.95 --> 2848.97
30 miles away you know but probably

2847.26 --> 2851.5800000000004
probably was because it was kind of in

2848.97 --> 2854.16
the area so I got it now review those

2851.58 --> 2856.17
tapes locate my stuff in the maps and

2854.16 --> 2856.62
see what I was looking at it's gonna be

2856.17 --> 2858.87
fun

2856.62 --> 2861.6
I still gonna put one or two videos

2858.87 --> 2863.85
probably like when they did Florida Bay

2861.6 --> 2865.95
shows are over because I took some

2863.85 --> 2868.83
pretty ones we did just in the ferry

2865.95 --> 2871.4399999999996
just do it 360 around with the boats and

2868.83 --> 2873.99
the birds you know just flying on behind

2871.44 --> 2876.0
the boat so I took some nice footage I

2873.99 --> 2877.7099999999996
enjoyed it a lot it was it's a lot of

2876.0 --> 2879.78
fun just to go to new places in

2877.71 --> 2882.2400000000002
different little adventure with the

2879.78 --> 2884.2200000000003
family and I did enjoy nature bro

2882.24 --> 2888.12
really cool stuff okay I put a link to

2884.22 --> 2891.1499999999996
your video in the chat so do check out

2888.12 --> 2896.7
Jose's video thank you yeah it was I

2891.15 --> 2898.05
mean what boys it was really windy yeah

2896.7 --> 2900.0899999999997
I'll take a look I haven't seen it

2898.05 --> 2902.4
myself I don't get notifications from

2900.09 --> 2906.0
you for some reason I bailed you now

2902.4 --> 2907.77
though so probably will from now on but

2906.0 --> 2910.26
I'll check it out myself I haven't seen

2907.77 --> 2910.5
it yet yeah that one is really raw you

2910.26 --> 2912.0600000000004
know

2910.5 --> 2913.86
I can kind of speak every once in a

2912.06 --> 2915.6
while and I go close to the phone and

2913.86 --> 2917.4900000000002
say like it's really windy I just

2915.6 --> 2919.77
recorded this to keep it in the in the

2917.49 --> 2921.5699999999997
file size I was here you know but it's

2919.77 --> 2924.0
cool to look at you know the little

2921.57 --> 2926.25
pieces that know everybody is you know

2924.0 --> 2930.09
are able to go and jump in little places

2926.25 --> 2932.34
off if you guys anybody go to a forest

2930.09 --> 2934.6800000000003
to a yield you know go I don't know

2932.34 --> 2936.42
horses riding do something a little

2934.68 --> 2938.64
simple that maybe you do in the daily

2936.42 --> 2940.5
basis maybe record a little video and

2938.64 --> 2943.17
put it up there because some of us are

2940.5 --> 2945.03
not experiences these these little

2943.17 --> 2947.4300000000003
things of nature's all that all the

2945.03 --> 2952.17
tabular I'm presenting at your video

2947.43 --> 2959.46
right now for a moment that's really she

2952.17 --> 2961.53
goes oh yeah it was like from side by

2959.46 --> 2963.21
side like boom so you have to hold on

2961.53 --> 2964.9100000000003
for dear life you know so you don't fall

2963.21 --> 2973.35
overboard you know I look I see

2964.91 --> 2982.8599999999997
curvature ah see absolutely flat haven't

2973.35 --> 2985.23
seen anything this flat Wow really cool

2982.86 --> 2988.77
you just drive over there you just go

2985.23 --> 2990.78
online on the on the cars just wait for

2988.77 --> 2992.88
u-turn and they give you the green light

2990.78 --> 2994.65
coming and you hope you put your spot in

2992.88 --> 2995.9100000000003
the boat it's free you don't have to

2994.65 --> 2997.83
find out and you put the car in the boat

2995.91 --> 3000.3199999999997
and they take you to the other side they

2997.83 --> 3001.79
open the thing and you just exit and

3000.32 --> 3004.13
hang out in the other side on for how

3001.79 --> 3005.9
long you want then come back and hop in

3004.13 --> 3011.15

3020.96 --> 3025.2200000000003
I took footage all all the trip along to

3023.69 --> 3027.86
all those Shores that you don't see

3025.22 --> 3030.9199999999996
nothing there's a lot out there a lot of

3027.86 --> 3033.08
little pieces of land and industry

3030.92 --> 3035.54
industrial like plants and stuff and

3033.08 --> 3039.62
buildings so yeah all that food is gonna

3035.54 --> 3043.55
be ready it's amazing now I'm present

3039.62 --> 3044.93
now before I end take away the antenna

everyone in chat just go and check it

3047.13 --> 3055.08
out it's really good so yeah thank you

3050.25 --> 3057.48
for making I'm sure you've seen air

3055.08 --> 3059.25
flight pictures but I just threw into

3057.48 --> 3067.7
that I took when I was flying to

3059.25 --> 3071.43
California in the Google traffic sorry I

3067.7 --> 3073.83
put two pictures into Google Chat of the

3071.43 --> 3078.0899999999997
shot from the window in the airliner

3073.83 --> 3082.13
that I was flying in it's about 30 where

3078.09 --> 3082.13
yeah I don't see anything

3082.55 --> 3090.4500000000003
are you sure well did you do in the back

3087.42 --> 3092.1
chat or something well I I don't talk

3090.45 --> 3093.93
back chat or whatever I'm just calling

3092.1 --> 3096.41
it the chat so I can see who's joined

3093.93 --> 3099.69
you know I mean it says I joined Jose

3096.41 --> 3101.3689999999997
music joined so wherever that is that we

3099.69 --> 3104.79
can send each other messages that's

3101.369 --> 3105.65
where I put the pictures I don't see

3104.79 --> 3107.67
anything

3105.65 --> 3109.14
sorry well then I'll throw that oh

3107.67 --> 3112.859
that's alright I'll just throw that you

3109.14 --> 3114.9
in Skype yeah you subscribe hey thank

3112.859 --> 3116.609
you shout out to the 22 watching in our

3114.9 --> 3117.75
voice Channel appreciate you guys you

3116.609 --> 3119.91
guys don't know you because I know

3117.75 --> 3121.98
there's like 180 watching on Nathan's

3119.91 --> 3123.69
Channel well you know we'll be there

3121.98 --> 3125.76
later on you know so it's not any type

3123.69 --> 3128.609
of competition we just I mean I'm

3125.76 --> 3130.4100000000003
personally I like stepping aside from

3128.609 --> 3132.5699999999997
the personal kind of very personal

3130.41 --> 3134.5499999999997
issues where it's all about the

3132.57 --> 3137.8500000000004
interpretation is somebody put a video

3134.55 --> 3139.53
and somebody else challenges it I'm

3137.85 --> 3141.5699999999997
interested in looking at that but later

3139.53 --> 3144.1400000000003
maybe in double-speed you know to see

3141.57 --> 3146.8500000000004
what the reborn I'm the explanations are

3144.14 --> 3149.94
yeah everything has a time is and the

3146.85 --> 3151.7999999999997
place is Rasta says it but yeah I'm

3149.94 --> 3155.67
presenting your pictures a girl there's

3151.8 --> 3163.26
the plane look look at the bottom the

3155.67 --> 3167.85
curve is right at the bottom now look at

3163.26 --> 3171.09
the sea it is curves just the other way

3167.85 --> 3174.0299999999997
it's the wrong way actually they're

3171.09 --> 3176.07
actually he appears to be to be a slight

3174.03 --> 3179.1800000000003
curve in there if it my eyes is then in

3176.07 --> 3182.63
the evolution is it the glass is single

3179.18 --> 3186.93
those windows are not perfectly straight

3182.63 --> 3189.1800000000003
trust me yeah because by mainstream

3186.93 --> 3192.0
science we're not able to detect this

3189.18 --> 3196.14
curvature from this eye so is my eyes

3192.0 --> 3199.56
playing tricks on me right the very nice

3196.14 --> 3201.27
picture thank you for that I don't have

3199.56 --> 3205.68
any program to throw a very straight in

3201.27 --> 3207.99
a little very line to see how straight

3205.68 --> 3209.16
it is even though if through a glass oh

3207.99 --> 3218.1
yes

3209.16 --> 3222.48
sketchy yeah the best way to do it is to

3218.1 --> 3225.63
just get a a personal plane or you know

3222.48 --> 3228.33
what you have like those open air little

3225.63 --> 3230.81
personal airplanes no that's the best

3228.33 --> 3233.58
there you can just sit there and just

3230.81 --> 3236.34
use the camera whatever you want to know

3233.58 --> 3238.95
class what people parachute so the

3236.34 --> 3241.2000000000003
parachute they use the GoPro very you

3238.95 --> 3243.87
know very distorted white which will

3241.2 --> 3245.46
look for parachute people that jump into

3243.87 --> 3246.6
parachute and there's somebody recording

3245.46 --> 3249.21
maybe from inside there playing with a

3246.6 --> 3253.44
regular rectilinear camera no fisheye

3249.21 --> 3257.01
lenses these are looks yeah what it's

3253.44 --> 3261.42
not that easy these days to find non

3257.01 --> 3263.9100000000003
GoPro lens little cameras or any of

3261.42 --> 3265.8
those as a standard addition in things

3263.91 --> 3268.98
like drones because they put them

3265.8 --> 3270.57
everywhere it's not an accident and

3268.98 --> 3273.0
they're also paper

3270.57 --> 3276.6600000000003
there are a lot cheaper than non fisheye

3273.0 --> 3278.82
lens cameras yes for their play Windows

3276.66 --> 3280.5899999999997
is I mean it's just through a glass the

3278.82 --> 3282.36
glasses has a curve on it so it's

3280.59 --> 3284.34
inconclusive for those who say like it

3282.36 --> 3287.9700000000003
but this clear is a curve in there

3284.34 --> 3292.11
I mean where is this shot through any

3287.97 --> 3294.2999999999997
any glass or any distorted you know you

3292.11 --> 3296.6400000000003
know the thing about it is in airplanes

3294.3 --> 3298.59
these glass windows will always be

3296.64 --> 3302.25
slightly curved enough because they will

3298.59 --> 3304.5
be a half but would that also would it

3302.25 --> 3306.66
also look like this if the window would

3304.5 --> 3308.28
actually be at the bottom half of the

3306.66 --> 3310.5899999999997
airplane you would be looking for that

3308.28 --> 3311.38
because I kind of think you would

3310.59 --> 3314.23
actually see

3311.38 --> 3319.589
a little slightly concave earth if you

3314.23 --> 3323.079
do that so it's part of the design so

3319.589 --> 3324.849
very well thought-out Oh totally

3323.079 --> 3327.88
obsessed with indoctrinating everyone

3324.849 --> 3330.309
with the globe as usual and then and in

3327.88 --> 3331.539
those place you got a little TV in front

3330.309 --> 3333.73
of you where it gives you this

3331.539 --> 3337.0890000000004
coordinate where the plane is going yeah

3333.73 --> 3339.16
and you should be balls exaggerated

3337.089 --> 3341.89
spinning ball underneath it like big

3339.16 --> 3343.18
curve on the plane over over it and then

3341.89 --> 3347.2889999999998
you look to the window and he looked

3343.18 --> 3349.4199999999996
nothing like oh and now they're probably

3347.289 --> 3352.0890000000004
like oh look this is where you're going

3349.42 --> 3355.089
and then showing you on a ball on the

3352.089 --> 3357.849
plane trust yeah you know this far to

3355.089 --> 3359.5589999999997
our destination on the ball I'm the

3357.849 --> 3361.869
weirdo that's on the plane that sits

3359.559 --> 3363.6400000000003
back in the galley looking at the of the

3361.869 --> 3365.7690000000002
windows that don't have seats just

3363.64 --> 3367.509
looking at what's going underneath and

3365.769 --> 3370.9199999999996
said everyone else is sleeping and

3367.509 --> 3375.13
looking at that arch over the ball and

3370.92 --> 3376.75
watching their movies mm-hmm yeah I

3375.13 --> 3380.079
don't mind any more these days I know

3376.75 --> 3383.799
what I know so I'm gonna round out the

3380.079 --> 3386.9500000000003
show guys it's a two more minutes so if

3383.799 --> 3389.019
you guys could commute thank you for
