early bird number

55.28 --> 60.359
1265 I'm your host Arwin and before we

[Music]

89.22 --> 92.53999999999999
whether today is

93.119 --> 101.52
rain rain rain and rain

98.52 --> 105.96
so yeah it's been pretty much

101.52 --> 108.72
raining non-stop since yesterday

105.96 --> 112.67999999999999
all throughout the night

108.72 --> 114.06
it's not always like this hard but it is

112.68 --> 118.14
pretty constant

114.06 --> 120.479
went out for groceries before this

118.14 --> 123.479
and yeah luckily it wasn't raining like

120.479 --> 124.92
this but still got wet

123.479 --> 129.14
so

124.92 --> 129.14000000000001
clouds they're rushing up there

136.85 --> 140.009
[Music]

142.98 --> 148.5
low Cleary first in chat

146.76 --> 150.72
uh

148.5 --> 154.04
starting very late today

150.72 --> 154.04
it's going to be a short show

154.8 --> 159.959
to yeah

157.14 --> 163.92
can't be out

159.959 --> 171.239
uh yesterday was an extra long show so

163.92 --> 171.23899999999998
right it is Monday the 6th of June 2022

171.66 --> 174.98
hello Daniel Robles

183.42 --> 186.07999999999998
ah

195.48 --> 201.23899999999998
right yeah I'm feeling

198.019 --> 203.04
meh today I mean yeah the rain's not

201.239 --> 205.62
very pleasant

203.04 --> 210.17999999999998
but uh

205.62 --> 212.59900000000002
also yeah add more tooth issues in the

210.18 --> 212.59900000000002
sense that

213.12 --> 218.58
more feelings have actually fallen out

216.0 --> 220.739
and it's really weird

218.58 --> 222.0
it's like pretty shocking every time

220.739 --> 225.12
that happens

222.0 --> 227.04
even though I'm keeping myself calm

225.12 --> 230.299
and weirdly enough it actually almost

227.04 --> 230.29899999999998
feels better like this

233.939 --> 241.07999999999998
but yeah it's just that in the last two

237.54 --> 243.599
months man this just literally teeth but

241.08 --> 246.299
it feels like teeth are just falling out

243.599 --> 249.72
all at the same time not the whole bit

246.299 --> 252.59900000000002
but Jesus man

249.72 --> 255.54
I mean I literally got a pile of

252.599 --> 259.139
tooth chips now

255.54 --> 261.65999999999997
it's creeping me out mostly just that

259.139 --> 263.699
but yeah this it's not hurting or

261.66 --> 266.18
anything and it seems like I can eat

263.699 --> 266.18
with it

266.699 --> 271.44
I just gotta be careful right there's no

269.28 --> 273.53999999999996
more hard candy

271.44 --> 275.4
crushing between my teeth kind of thing

273.54 --> 279.259
like I just

275.4 --> 279.25899999999996
just can never do that again

279.66 --> 287.12
uh I used to do that a lot as a kid and

283.199 --> 287.12
that's probably what led to all this

287.28 --> 291.0
right

289.08 --> 294.979
as long as I'm careful

291.0 --> 294.979
everything will work out just fine

296.1 --> 299.0
hello Crockett

304.259 --> 311.24
but yeah at some point

307.259 --> 311.24
I mean I don't think I can like

311.52 --> 316.44
could go another 10 years with this but

314.22 --> 318.47900000000004
probably a few

316.44 --> 320.28
because

318.479 --> 323.12
yeah

320.28 --> 323.11999999999995
I didn't know

324.32 --> 328.979
[Music]

325.979 --> 331.15999999999997
anyway eighth letter Sage good to see

328.979 --> 331.15999999999997
you

331.68 --> 335.479
thought yesterday was a pretty good show

337.02 --> 343.02
I'm still getting like baller troll

340.08 --> 345.419
comments over that time

343.02 --> 348.44
it's like every time I bring up gas

345.419 --> 348.44
having no Mass

348.72 --> 354.12
it's just they never stop about it

351.96 --> 355.94
they never

354.12 --> 359.4
stop

355.94 --> 362.419
blabbering on about that it's like they

359.4 --> 362.419
really can't handle it

363.96 --> 367.81899999999996
it is what I'm noticing is that

367.979 --> 373.86
I'm trying to figure out like how would

370.08 --> 376.74
how it's working with people right

373.86 --> 379.38
how it is actually working

376.74 --> 382.62
and I think that

379.38 --> 385.62
a lot of people just learned the system

382.62 --> 389.52
they got handed in school

385.62 --> 393.18
and it like solidified in their mind

389.52 --> 395.81899999999996
and people like me and Nathan and all

393.18 --> 398.759
the FED panel like where

395.819 --> 402.6
like much more really on the nose

398.759 --> 406.5
physicists were trying to figure out

402.6 --> 408.5
like the roots of all these formulas

406.5 --> 411.96
right

408.5 --> 413.24
and thereby discovering like how gravity

411.96 --> 415.85999999999996
is basically

413.24 --> 419.099
presupposed and then tied into a whole

415.86 --> 421.44
bunch of factors like Mass

419.099 --> 423.71999999999997
right and just the endless amounts of

421.44 --> 425.4
complications and inconsistencies with

423.72 --> 427.199
that model

425.4 --> 429.9
and

427.199 --> 433.979
I don't even know if it's like a baller

429.9 --> 437.099
thing or if it's just people that can't

433.979 --> 438.84
let go of that formula they learned in

437.099 --> 440.639
school because it was good enough they

438.84 --> 443.4
solidified it

440.639 --> 445.68
and now we're just pointing out like

443.4 --> 447.96
yeah it doesn't actually work that thing

445.68 --> 451.62
that you learned and was solidified in

447.96 --> 454.62
your mind is just not correct and

451.62 --> 457.74
exactly why

454.62 --> 461.06
and they just can't handle it

457.74 --> 461.06
I think that's what's going on

461.099 --> 464.3
are you seeking star water

465.78 --> 470.75899999999996
and Godzilla

468.599 --> 473.539
yeah yeah derp alert

470.759 --> 473.539
for sure

478.62 --> 483.0
and by the way it was kind of funny

480.36 --> 485.639
because I looked into the chat and they

483.0 --> 488.699
were whining about oh but the gas tanks

485.639 --> 491.639
actually do

488.699 --> 495.0
have like notifications of weight

491.639 --> 498.24
like kilograms I was like come on

495.0 --> 500.699
that like that's just so annoying

498.24 --> 501.84000000000003
but I I look fairly look fair enough I

500.699 --> 504.96000000000004
looked it up

501.84 --> 507.84
and it seems that like yeah

504.96 --> 511.02
a lot of them do but here's the thing

507.84 --> 513.539
not all of them some of them actually

511.02 --> 516.24
had notifications

513.539 --> 521.24
content in leaders

516.24 --> 521.24
so it's not even Universal that much

522.419 --> 528.18
right but it's basically like oh because

525.3 --> 531.4799999999999
they notify it in something that means

528.18 --> 533.0999999999999
that gases have mass of course

531.48 --> 536.339
on the side

533.1 --> 538.26
that yeah gas tanks don't have like

536.339 --> 541.44
uncompacted gas

538.26 --> 543.8389999999999
so it's usually pressurized to the point

541.44 --> 546.6600000000001
where it becomes a liquid and then yeah

543.839 --> 549.5600000000001
then it get then it gains weight

546.66 --> 549.56
effectively

549.959 --> 555.3599999999999
right and this part they don't even want

553.019 --> 558.18
to know about it

555.36 --> 560.339
like everything has to have weight at

558.18 --> 563.2199999999999
all time in their minds

560.339 --> 565.2
it has to be Universal

563.22 --> 568.64
they don't understand that it's actually

565.2 --> 568.6400000000001
derived from a convention

569.6 --> 574.14
based on relative density this

572.16 --> 578.399
equilibrium

574.14 --> 583.16
of an object versus the medium of

578.399 --> 583.16
regular gas pressure at ground level

584.04 --> 587.88
where does the mass go it no longer

586.44 --> 593.1
exists

587.88 --> 597.12
right synthetic Cynthia is simply

593.1 --> 600.5400000000001
look think of it like this

597.12 --> 602.54
a liquid has like more bonds than a

600.54 --> 606.0
solid like

602.54 --> 610.3199999999999
intramolecular bonds

606.0 --> 612.06
and then as its transition into a gas

610.32 --> 615.1800000000001
and you know that's possible in a

612.06 --> 617.76
variety of ways it no longer has those

615.18 --> 620.459
bumps well that's basically the answer

617.76 --> 622.38
to your question where does the mass go

620.459 --> 625.9799999999999
when it's not compressed

622.38 --> 627.66
yeah well where does the intermolecular

625.98 --> 632.0
bonds go

627.66 --> 632.0
when it is not compressed

634.04 --> 640.26
it's not there anymore yeah

637.38 --> 643.14
that's not a gotcha question where does

640.26 --> 645.6
the mass go when this and yeah it's not

643.14 --> 649.399
there anymore

645.6 --> 649.399
because it's a derived concept

650.7 --> 655.7
this does not reduce no it goes away

655.74 --> 663.0
and by the way it was just an example of

658.86 --> 666.72
a typical molecular ability

663.0 --> 669.839
that material has in a certain State and

666.72 --> 671.4590000000001
then how that particular ability can go

669.839 --> 674.8800000000001
away

671.459 --> 677.2299999999999
when the material is transformed into

674.88 --> 685.2
another state

677.23 --> 685.2
[Music]

690.06 --> 695.54
wow John 925 is that your entry question

699.779 --> 703.86
is that really what you're gonna enter

701.64 --> 705.18
what you know what usually happens to

703.86 --> 708.0
people

705.18 --> 710.0999999999999
when they enter my chat with questions

708.0 --> 713.839
like that

710.1 --> 717.36
like why do you conduct your

713.839 --> 722.519
actions in the chat like that

717.36 --> 725.1
that's not about any subject and it's

722.519 --> 728.36
not a good way to enter it's how people

725.1 --> 728.36
end up getting banned

729.839 --> 732.8000000000001
hey can a bear

734.77 --> 739.89
[Music]

747.54 --> 751.92
sounds like he's mocking people

749.399 --> 754.82
sometimes well let's just say it like

751.92 --> 754.8199999999999
this Godzilla

756.06 --> 762.0189999999999
I am bit I am a bit of a patronizing

759.72 --> 762.019
person

763.5 --> 768.42
it's just that

765.779 --> 770.279
I spent like half my life trying to

768.42 --> 775.04
contain

770.279 --> 775.04
my discontent towards others

775.1 --> 782.339
and like really like it wasn't there

779.579 --> 784.56
and the only thing I ever got from it is

782.339 --> 789.0
people abusing

784.56 --> 792.5999999999999
my going along to get a long ability

789.0 --> 795.12
so I've made a habit of just not holding

792.6 --> 798.6800000000001
that back anymore so if somebody annoys

795.12 --> 802.44
me even if that might be

798.68 --> 804.7199999999999
unreasonable on average I will just

802.44 --> 807.7790000000001
express it anyway I won't

804.72 --> 810.48
push it out but I'm not gonna hold back

807.779 --> 813.54
either and that is probably

810.48 --> 817.32
what some of you are sensing

813.54 --> 818.88
it's like this weird male content

817.32 --> 822.12
sense

818.88 --> 824.3389999999999
which I do Express it is part of me it

822.12 --> 827.579
is part of what I do I only do it

824.339 --> 831.0
however when I'm discussing

827.579 --> 833.579
like subjects that are usually a bit

831.0 --> 836.519
more complicated require focus and where

833.579 --> 839.88
people will have a lot of opportunity to

836.519 --> 842.519
distract themselves away from

839.88 --> 845.519
cohesion

842.519 --> 847.1
and when I notice that that is there or

845.519 --> 850.38
that people are doing that that

847.1 --> 852.4200000000001
immediately gives me an impulse

850.38 --> 855.959
of male content

852.42 --> 858.42
I immediately like I'm right there to

855.959 --> 861.3
basically in anticipation of that

858.42 --> 864.3
behavior getting ready to whip you into

861.3 --> 867.06
place if you show signs that you're

864.3 --> 868.92
gonna like Let It Go

867.06 --> 871.199
right

868.92 --> 873.38
that's where some of these impulses are

871.199 --> 873.38
from

873.48 --> 877.22
I hope that explains something

884.459 --> 887.459
Godzilla

908.579 --> 912.42
you think that's a fair assessment

910.68 --> 914.959
Godzilla

912.42 --> 919.0999999999999
like to hear your

914.959 --> 919.0999999999999
opinion about what I just said

919.56 --> 925.6089999999999
[Music]

926.579 --> 934.459
yeah people extorted empaths and not

930.06 --> 934.459
just a little okay a lot

943.339 --> 947.4200000000001
they saw it as weakness

950.399 --> 956.04
it was

952.44 --> 959.72
this ability of mine was treated by

956.04 --> 959.7199999999999
others like it's a weakness

962.04 --> 965.8389999999999
and I had to like

965.94 --> 971.339
and you're pretty severe

969.72 --> 975.32
terrors

971.339 --> 975.32
just to be able to hold on to it

978.42 --> 982.639
and there were absolutely times where I

980.94 --> 985.5
was just like

982.639 --> 988.019
wishing all day long like I wish I

985.5 --> 990.36
wasn't this I wish I didn't have this

988.019 --> 991.98
thing why can't I just be like everybody

990.36 --> 993.1800000000001
else

991.98 --> 996.72
then

993.18 --> 998.6389999999999
I would like go out without like hang

996.72 --> 1000.9200000000001
with other people

998.639 --> 1002.42
like almost from a depressed state from

1000.92 --> 1005.24
a depleted state

1002.42 --> 1008.36
to kind of like not have those meddling

1005.24 --> 1011.0600000000001
impulses and drive all the time to

1008.36 --> 1013.639
outshine stuff

1011.06 --> 1016.7589999999999
but to just analyze those people and

1013.639 --> 1021.279
then I would realize like no

1016.759 --> 1021.279
no it's actually them that stuck

1023.42 --> 1030.5
they're the ones that

1025.579 --> 1033.079
can't reach and half like that serious

1033.079 --> 1041.959

1038.0 --> 1044.78
they don't they can't even see it

1041.959 --> 1049.1200000000001
so they just identified in their mind as

1044.78 --> 1049.12
something else as a systemic weakness

1051.2 --> 1053.799
foreign

1061.34 --> 1066.74
just think of it like this I was called

1065.12 --> 1068.78
gay

1066.74 --> 1072.039
for being an empath

1068.78 --> 1074.72
not because I had like those typical

1072.039 --> 1078.62
expressions or anything

1074.72 --> 1081.08
but because I was simply sensitive and

1078.62 --> 1085.2399999999998
knew things about that new things about

1081.08 --> 1085.24
the subtle things in life

1086.72 --> 1094.48
and people would just say you are gay

1091.34 --> 1094.48
just because of that

1100.22 --> 1107.26
right and that eventually caused me like

1103.16 --> 1107.26
especially around my teens to just like

1110.299 --> 1118.84
really no longer openly share my ability

1115.4 --> 1118.8400000000001
with the outside world

1120.38 --> 1126.8600000000001
and just carefully pick friends to which

1123.74 --> 1130.96
I could still reveal it after sizing up

1126.86 --> 1130.9599999999998

he told gasps that soul in kilograms

1161.539 --> 1167.539
it's not actually gas as it is sold

1166.22 --> 1170.84
yeah

1167.539 --> 1172.34
it's compacted it's not a gas anymore it

1170.84 --> 1176.9599999999998
effectively

1172.34 --> 1180.82
literally isn't a gas anymore when it is

[Music]

1213.94 --> 1219.0800000000002
most gas turns the liquid when

1216.919 --> 1222.14
compressed

1219.08 --> 1225.1589999999999
and some gas even apparently turns into

1222.14 --> 1225.159
like solid Crystal

1225.2 --> 1231.32
right which is weird it's not even a

1228.679 --> 1233.659
uniform process but there are some gases

1231.32 --> 1236.78
which when you compress them they don't

1233.659 --> 1238.88
turn to liquid they just turn into this

1236.78 --> 1241.46
weird super fluid

1238.88 --> 1244.64
like this weird in-between gas and

1241.46 --> 1247.659
liquid state is very odd

1244.64 --> 1249.919
right but regular

1247.659 --> 1254.24
expanded gas

1249.919 --> 1256.88
that's not how you buy it

1254.24 --> 1259.76
right they don't you don't go to a store

1256.88 --> 1262.8200000000002
and then yeah could you give me like a

1259.76 --> 1265.34
balloon this big with this specific gas

1262.82 --> 1270.28
in it that's not how you get the gas you

1265.34 --> 1270.28
get it compacted into a tank

1271.1 --> 1277.1589999999999
so it is called gas because the normal

1274.52 --> 1282.26
use of that product

1277.159 --> 1286.88
is for its expanded State usually

1282.26 --> 1290.2
but as you're buying it it's effectively

1286.88 --> 1290.2
not gas

keep repeating it with all your socks

1300.5 --> 1306.32
all day long gas in the store is

1303.98 --> 1309.44
was sold in kilograms yeah yeah yeah

1306.32 --> 1312.1399999999999
yeah I know yeah it's just compacted

1309.44 --> 1316.28
though it's not expanded gas

1312.14 --> 1320.2
and most compacted gas in tankers

1316.28 --> 1320.2
is in a liquid form

1325.46 --> 1330.08
because if it's expanded there is not

1328.159 --> 1332.179
going to be any weight to it and

1330.08 --> 1334.76
whatever you're going to do with it it's

1332.179 --> 1337.52
going to run out very quickly

1334.76 --> 1341.299
so you don't go to a store to buy a

1337.52 --> 1344.9
giant Zeppelin filled with expanded gas

1341.299 --> 1348.74
you buy tankers in which it is compacted

1344.9 --> 1351.74
compressed until it's a liquid and as it

1348.74 --> 1356.6
is in a liquid state or solid or super

1351.74 --> 1361.419
fluid yeah it gains Mass because it's

1356.6 --> 1361.4189999999999
not standard expanded gaseous

1368.26 --> 1375.919

1556.279 --> 1565.159
they don't mean the state gas

1559.94 --> 1567.98
they mean a material that typically in

1565.159 --> 1569.8400000000001
the natural world will be in a gaseous

1645.98 --> 1652.6
that's the point

that's my point gases don't have mass

not a material selection

1656.98 --> 1665.6
colloquially designated as gas you

1661.1 --> 1669.3799999999999

no I don't think so can a bear

1695.48 --> 1700.3990000000001
but there is like transitional States

1697.88 --> 1703.5800000000002
between solid and liquid like for

1700.399 --> 1704.7199999999998
example glass glass is effectively a

1703.58 --> 1707.36
liquid

1704.72 --> 1710.84
but it is so

1707.36 --> 1714.1399999999999
slow in its Dynamic that it is

1710.84 --> 1718.6
effectively a solid so it's there's no

1714.14 --> 1718.6000000000001
other material state in between

1720.62 --> 1726.399

1797.36 --> 1802.399

1800.6 --> 1806.3799999999999
colloquial use

1802.399 --> 1810.32
of words out there and very specific

1806.38 --> 1811.46

1811.46 --> 1817.64
if they could if they wouldn't have been

1813.679 --> 1820.46
rambling on and whining about it for

they're just not understanding

it's basic cognition problems

1840.02 --> 1844.8799999999999
that's also why they get so annoying

1842.299 --> 1846.94
about it because those types of problems

1844.88 --> 1850.64
always yields

1846.94 --> 1853.1000000000001
the most trouble and the most friction

critical thinking Stripped Away in

1912.32 --> 1916.22
childhood no I don't I wouldn't call it

1914.48 --> 1919.22
that

1916.22 --> 1921.34
they abandoned it

1919.22 --> 1925.039
they thought

1921.34 --> 1927.32
they would do well enough without

1925.039 --> 1929.779
critical thinking they thought that what

1927.32 --> 1933.2
was provided to them

1929.779 --> 1935.659
was reliable enough to completely merge

1933.2 --> 1939.14
with mentally

1935.659 --> 1941.8990000000001
to assimilate without question

1939.14 --> 1944.3600000000001
and then rule from within the system

1941.899 --> 1945.9799999999998
that's what they thought so it's not you

1944.36 --> 1949.9399999999998
can't really strip away somebody's

1945.98 --> 1953.1200000000001
critical thinking you can bully it out

1949.94 --> 1956.059
you can like torture it out but that

1953.12 --> 1957.9189999999999
doesn't really happen maybe slight

1956.059 --> 1961.34
discouragement and all that

1957.919 --> 1962.8400000000001
but yeah even if a child is like in a

1961.34 --> 1965.0
conflict like that on school

1962.84 --> 1968.24
philosophically and their parents are

1965.0 --> 1969.98
like backing them and most parents of

1968.24 --> 1972.08
smart children do actually back them

1969.98 --> 1974.1200000000001
then they're not going to be discouraged

1972.08 --> 1976.6
by that they'll just see it as another

1974.12 --> 1976.6
challenge

1978.32 --> 1983.1789999999999
right so critical thinking cannot

1980.72 --> 1985.1000000000001
effectively be destroyed but it can be

1983.179 --> 1988.039
abandoned

1985.1 --> 1990.26
and when that happens it usually happens

1988.039 --> 1992.96
because the person doing that things

1990.26 --> 1995.419
that they can basically let it go

1992.96 --> 1997.82
because critical thinking is kind of

1995.419 --> 2001.0
tiresome a lot

1997.82 --> 2003.76
because if you always need to do that

2001.0 --> 2006.88
that means you could never just let

2003.76 --> 2008.14
everything be and smooth right you gotta

2006.88 --> 2009.7600000000002
figure it out you got to figure out

2008.14 --> 2013.8400000000001
what's real

2009.76 --> 2015.82
it's tiresome it causes friction more

2013.84 --> 2016.84
than if you just go along with

2015.82 --> 2019.299
everything

2016.84 --> 2022.72
right it can't be stripped away but it

2019.299 --> 2026.08
can be abandoned in a world

2022.72 --> 2028.659
where it's just made belief that you

2026.08 --> 2031.299
don't really need it

2028.659 --> 2032.8600000000001
can be tricked in abandoning it and

2031.299 --> 2035.1589999999999
that's what I think happens to most

2032.86 --> 2035.1589999999999

it's all kinds of material mostly silica

2076.72 --> 2083.0789999999997
they're crystals

2079.659 --> 2085.359
they're not really liquid

2083.079 --> 2086.8
like over time they're not gonna like

2085.359 --> 2090.52
start

2086.8 --> 2093.28
like forming a solid like that I think

2090.52 --> 2094.899
but glass which has been effectively

2093.28 --> 2096.82
Molten

2094.899 --> 2101.38
sand

2096.82 --> 2104.1600000000003
is like sort of it remains liquid

2101.38 --> 2104.1600000000003
it's different

2110.26 --> 2116.5600000000004
it's just more

2112.859 --> 2118.5989999999997
fluid as a liquid when it's hot and then

2116.56 --> 2122.74
when it cools down it kind of like

2118.599 --> 2125.2000000000003
becomes super slow like super slow

2122.74 --> 2127.54
moving liquid

2125.2 --> 2130.6189999999997
that's what it is

2127.54 --> 2130.619
hey chocolate sane

2131.56 --> 2134.5789999999997
good to see you in here

2146.5 --> 2149.71
[Music]

2153.099 --> 2159.76
isn't this just amazing guys that

2156.76 --> 2163.119
I'm addressing the issue answering the

2159.76 --> 2167.44
questions I'm act a bit

2163.119 --> 2170.079
slightly agitated maybe mid Snivy right

2167.44 --> 2172.2400000000002
but I'm not actually really pissed off

2170.079 --> 2175.3590000000004
like some other days

2172.24 --> 2176.56
and as I'm basically just addressing

2175.359 --> 2179.0789999999997
everything

2176.56 --> 2181.9
is when they choose to like oh look a

2179.079 --> 2184.6600000000003
sign of weakness look at her cursing and

2181.9 --> 2187.7200000000003
he's ad homing me all the time

2184.66 --> 2190.44
when I specifically don't do that isn't

2187.72 --> 2190.4399999999996
it just like

2198.0 --> 2203.619
I mean are these people actually

2200.38 --> 2205.619
conscious of what rolls out of them

2203.619 --> 2208.96
are they

2205.619 --> 2210.7000000000003
lying so brazenly

2208.96 --> 2212.8
with a plan

2210.7 --> 2214.6189999999997
like is this a double speak

2212.8 --> 2217.48
psychological attack

2214.619 --> 2220.359
organized by a group of people

2217.48 --> 2222.339
that might actually have like higher

2220.359 --> 2224.38
directions

2222.339 --> 2227.38
I mean I wouldn't be surprised if

2224.38 --> 2231.7000000000003
there's just agencies that are like this

2227.38 --> 2232.96
guy is like untameable we need to

2231.7 --> 2235.4199999999996
send

2232.96 --> 2237.94
bullies like psychological warfare

2235.42 --> 2241.1800000000003
people after him to just keep breaking

2237.94 --> 2244.54
him down no matter what he does

2241.18 --> 2246.8799999999997
that's really the feeling I get

2244.54 --> 2249.339
that they're just doing that like it's

2246.88 --> 2253.6600000000003
not about the arguments it's just like

2249.339 --> 2256.48
just break him keep breaking him lie

2253.66 --> 2259.24
whatever bring back memories of the

2256.48 --> 2261.339
worst times whatever you do just keep

2259.24 --> 2263.2599999999998
breaking him keep breaking him is that

2261.339 --> 2264.94
what you're doing or are you actually

2263.26 --> 2269.44
here

2264.94 --> 2272.14
to learn something about reality

2269.44 --> 2273.4
and your life

2272.14 --> 2276.94
because

2273.4 --> 2277.6600000000003
John 95 and those other numpties out

2276.94 --> 2281.079
there

2277.66 --> 2284.92
it doesn't really sound like you're

2281.079 --> 2287.2000000000003
actually interested in learning anything

2284.92 --> 2290.14
you just seem to be interested in

2287.2 --> 2293.2799999999997
somehow making me stop

2290.14 --> 2293.2799999999997
I'm not gonna stop

2293.74 --> 2300.04
I mean dude you can do whatever you want

2296.619 --> 2301.2400000000002
like martyr yourself if you if you feel

2300.04 --> 2304.72
you need to

2301.24 --> 2307.68
I'm not gonna stop no matter what no

2304.72 --> 2307.68
matter what happens

2307.839 --> 2311.14
the only thing that's going to stop me

2309.579 --> 2314.1400000000003
is death

2311.14 --> 2316.3799999999997
and arguably not even that is gonna stop

2314.14 --> 2316.3799999999997
me

2317.56 --> 2323.92
because I'm pretty sure that once I'm

2320.32 --> 2326.5
detached from this body there's a lot

2323.92 --> 2330.04
more a lot

2326.5 --> 2332.98
and I'm very very metalsome with the

2330.04 --> 2335.14
Affairs of this realm

2332.98 --> 2338.619
bet your ass

2335.14 --> 2340.54
strike me down and I might just become

2338.619 --> 2342.7000000000003
more powerful than you can possibly

2340.54 --> 2347.64
imagine

2342.7 --> 2347.64
and that's a very serious application

2357.4 --> 2361.32
yeah Star Wars lull yeah

2361.59 --> 2367.7200000000003
[Music]

2364.06 --> 2370.18
just saying it applies and not and not

2367.72 --> 2373.98
even through sociology martyrdom I'm

2370.18 --> 2373.98
talking about esoteric [ __ ]

2375.7 --> 2381.52
I'm talking about Spirit mechanics I'm

2378.099 --> 2384.46
talking about function on the other side

2381.52 --> 2388.079
death is not the end it's not even the

2384.46 --> 2388.079
end for the Affairs of this world

2393.16 --> 2396.42
there's another layer

2397.3 --> 2402.82
and things happen there too it's part of

2400.48 --> 2406.56
the machine of everything

2402.82 --> 2406.56
Beyond Death you understand

2407.2 --> 2412.66
there's more I've seen it dark world

2409.839 --> 2416.74
it's there it's right there I've seen

2412.66 --> 2419.0789999999997
what happens it's crazy to even share

2416.74 --> 2422.4399999999996
what I saw about it

2419.079 --> 2425.619
that like people could die under

2422.44 --> 2429.7000000000003
specific circumstances and then

2425.619 --> 2431.859
their Spirit would transition into like

2429.7 --> 2433.18
another part of the machine on the other

2431.859 --> 2437.44
side

2433.18 --> 2442.02
and it was all prey designed

2437.44 --> 2442.02
it's it's so surreal

2449.619 --> 2453.4
am I going to come back and haunt

2451.599 --> 2455.98
YouTube now

2453.4 --> 2459.579
no no I think I've already haunted

2455.98 --> 2463.56
YouTube well enough as it is

2459.579 --> 2463.5600000000004
I don't need to add anything more

2463.66 --> 2468.3999999999996
after my death I mean

2466.599 --> 2471.9
besides it's going to take quite some

2468.4 --> 2471.9
time before I get there anyway

2472.05 --> 2475.28
[Music]

2480.339 --> 2487.0789999999997
all right besides people like you risky

2483.22 --> 2487.0789999999997
cabbages I'm already haunting you

2487.18 --> 2492.3999999999996
yeah that's that's a funny thing

2490.119 --> 2494.6400000000003
you see demons

2492.4 --> 2498.28
make you think

2494.64 --> 2500.7999999999997
you're haunting somebody

2498.28 --> 2503.2000000000003
right that you're the badass you're

2500.8 --> 2505.54
stalking him sneaking in making his life

2503.2 --> 2508.0
miserable whatever right that's the

2505.54 --> 2510.52
demon you telling you that you're

2508.0 --> 2513.22
haunting me

2510.52 --> 2516.04
well

2513.22 --> 2518.3799999999997
funnily enough demons lie about

2516.04 --> 2522.2799999999997
everything perfectly

2518.38 --> 2523.54
not just the lie no they lie perfectly

2522.28 --> 2527.46
you see

2523.54 --> 2530.14
it is I that is actually haunting you

2527.46 --> 2532.839
right now

2530.14 --> 2536.02
you're just in the Inside Out World

2532.839 --> 2538.54
thanks to the demons possessing you

2536.02 --> 2540.52
to make yourself believe like it is you

2538.54 --> 2543.119
that is haunting me

2540.52 --> 2543.119
you see

2543.16 --> 2549.42
but you're the one spending all this

2545.44 --> 2553.48
energy in trying to go after me somehow

2549.42 --> 2556.1800000000003
absolutely futile no grasp on anything

2553.48 --> 2558.7
not even close

2556.18 --> 2559.66
and you're wasting all your time and

2558.7 --> 2562.2999999999997
energy

2559.66 --> 2565.1189999999997
doing that

2562.3 --> 2567.28
I don't even know who you are really I

2565.119 --> 2570.48
don't care I don't care what you have

2567.28 --> 2570.48
what you have done

2571.78 --> 2580.8390000000004
you see I'm not overly burdened by any

2576.339 --> 2584.7999999999997
feelings concerning you yeah so it is

2580.839 --> 2588.4
actually me haunting you yeah you coming

2584.8 --> 2589.78
back every day to make baseless [ __ ]

2588.4 --> 2592.96
assertions

2589.78 --> 2596.2000000000003
and complaining about my code of conduct

2592.96 --> 2599.619
when I'm not even doing that yeah that's

2596.2 --> 2601.8999999999996
not you haunting me that's me haunting

2599.619 --> 2604.54
you you understand

2601.9 --> 2607.6600000000003
but by all means keep listening to that

2604.54 --> 2611.5
demon inside of you I mean

2607.66 --> 2614.6189999999997
it's done so much good for you right so

2611.5 --> 2617.74
far listening to Demons oh you get so

2614.619 --> 2621.28
much out of that I mean

2617.74 --> 2623.8799999999997
just keep on doing it all right

2621.28 --> 2623.88
foreign

2633.24 --> 2640.4399999999996
yes I know yes

2635.5 --> 2640.44
but you see Jim Bob is another person

2643.24 --> 2647.859
do you understand

2644.859 --> 2651.339
I can do things Jim Bob can't

2647.859 --> 2655.0789999999997
Jim Bob can do things I can't

2651.339 --> 2659.74
funny thing is we naturally

2655.079 --> 2663.28
know that about each other you

2659.74 --> 2666.3999999999996
numpty [ __ ] with barely any faculties

2663.28 --> 2669.2200000000003
or sensories left you can't even see

2666.4 --> 2673.119
that about how we can see that about

2669.22 --> 2677.04
each other because you're not cohesive

2673.119 --> 2677.04
enough to reach that level

2677.2 --> 2683.02
you see

2679.0 --> 2686.079
I'm not jealous of Jimbo being like that

2683.02 --> 2686.92
I'm actually kind of happy that I'm like

2686.079 --> 2690.579
that

2686.92 --> 2694.44
like I am not like how he is perfectly

2690.579 --> 2698.92
calm because I

2694.44 --> 2703.119
utilize my passions

2698.92 --> 2707.92
yeah I use them

2703.119 --> 2711.88
I train them I become better with them

2707.92 --> 2715.78
more refined applying them

2711.88 --> 2719.619
yeah Jim Bob's not going to develop that

2715.78 --> 2722.5600000000004
because when you're perfectly

2719.619 --> 2726.1600000000003
unfazed

2722.56 --> 2728.619
that's all you do you just deflect you

2726.16 --> 2731.56
keep moving and you try to

2728.619 --> 2734.319
erect as much energy and cohesion as you

2731.56 --> 2736.96
can after having deflected it it's a

2734.319 --> 2739.48
different Spirit mechanical process it

2736.96 --> 2740.92
leads to different development

2739.48 --> 2745.599
I

2740.92 --> 2749.38
use it I express it I feel it I give it

2745.599 --> 2752.6800000000003
the moment to manifest

2749.38 --> 2755.26
and even disrupt the situation

2752.68 --> 2757.96
I even let it do that you know why

2755.26 --> 2759.7000000000003
because it actually leads to something

2757.96 --> 2763.839
it

2759.7 --> 2766.7799999999997
it changes things around it slaps you a

2763.839 --> 2769.0
bit in the face to wake you up it has

2766.78 --> 2770.079
all kinds of function

2769.0 --> 2773.68
yeah

2770.079 --> 2776.6800000000003
my expression my passion and my

2773.68 --> 2779.64
agitation expression and all that

2776.68 --> 2779.64
giddiness

2779.68 --> 2785.2
Clowning Around even at times with other

2782.079 --> 2788.26
guys it all has a function I learned it

2785.2 --> 2790.24
it didn't start out as effective yeah

2788.26 --> 2792.88
when I was doing these things when I was

2790.24 --> 2794.6189999999997
young it was mostly just [ __ ]

2792.88 --> 2796.1800000000003
annoying

2794.619 --> 2798.94
like

2796.18 --> 2800.68
it really was annoying and it's a

2798.94 --> 2802.2400000000002
miracle that there's people that there

2800.68 --> 2806.68
have been people out there that were

2802.24 --> 2809.4399999999996
actually willing to just tolerate that

2806.68 --> 2812.74
but because of them I got the

2809.44 --> 2814.96
opportunity to basically train these

2812.74 --> 2818.859
natural traits

2814.96 --> 2822.78
and Forge them into skills

2818.859 --> 2825.7599999999998
that I'm applying right now still

2822.78 --> 2828.48
systematically unrepentingly it's a part

2825.76 --> 2828.48
of what I am

2829.42 --> 2832.92
and they have a function

2838.06 --> 2845.0789999999997
yeah and yeah Jim Bob is freaking

2841.0 --> 2847.96
amazing I I like how unfazed yes it is

2845.079 --> 2850.78
pretty amazing I know though that that

2847.96 --> 2853.2400000000002
comes with a price and apparently that

2850.78 --> 2855.46
price is worth it to him

2853.24 --> 2858.2999999999997
it is

2855.46 --> 2858.3
his choice

2859.24 --> 2864.7599999999998
he probably needed to do that in the

2862.42 --> 2867.819
face of his kids

2864.76 --> 2868.599
which are like scarily talented by the

2867.819 --> 2871.119
way

2868.599 --> 2875.38
so yeah then it makes sense that you

2871.119 --> 2877.42
take on a role of absolute unfacedness

2875.38 --> 2878.38
and never let your ego get in the way

2877.42 --> 2882.48
ever

2878.38 --> 2882.48
because that kid right

2882.94 --> 2887.7400000000002
I don't I'm not in that position if I'd

2885.22 --> 2891.4599999999996
get kids I'd probably

2887.74 --> 2893.2
some point would also do the same thing

2891.46 --> 2895.599
and lock it away

2893.2 --> 2899.6189999999997
but as long as I don't

2895.599 --> 2902.26
have that I'm going to use my skill

2899.619 --> 2904.1800000000003
I'm going to use my expression I'm going

2902.26 --> 2908.0200000000004
to use my passion

2904.18 --> 2911.7999999999997
apply it and improve upon it and show

2908.02 --> 2914.74
that it's like not all anger

2911.8 --> 2917.44
is weakness

2914.74 --> 2920.319
I mean it can be weakness

2917.44 --> 2923.02
if you're just squirting if you're just

2920.319 --> 2927.16
letting it go tearing off your faculties

2923.02 --> 2929.8
and just yeah that's weakness yeah but

2927.16 --> 2932.68
you can also harness it and actually

2929.8 --> 2937.42
like a war Beast

2932.68 --> 2939.819
just weaponize it and make it effective

2937.42 --> 2943.02
in something

2939.819 --> 2943.02
and that's what I do

2953.57 --> 2958.449
[Music]

2962.2 --> 2968.02
considering I'm the consumer oh you're

2964.599 --> 2970.92
the consumer of my show Arya

2968.02 --> 2970.92
well

2973.0 --> 2979.18
more like a freeloader

2975.819 --> 2981.04
yeah I mean a consumer is usually a

2979.18 --> 2983.94
paying customer are you a paying

2981.04 --> 2983.94
customer John

2984.579 --> 2988.6800000000003
sounds more like you're a freeloader

2994.0 --> 2999.76
and I'm okay with that weren't that

2996.7 --> 3003.319
you're like trying to like attain some

2999.76 --> 3007.3190000000004
kind of a corporate judicial power

3003.319 --> 3010.2599999999998
calling yourself a consumer like you're

3007.319 --> 3014.7599999999998
consuming my product well you're not

3010.26 --> 3018.079
paying me for that you're a freeloader

3014.76 --> 3021.559
yeah you don't have any

3018.079 --> 3021.559
consumer rights

3021.599 --> 3026.0
you understand

3022.85 --> 3026.0
[Music]

3029.82 --> 3033.9
[Music]

3031.44 --> 3035.46
yeah that's right I am calling him a

3033.9 --> 3039.3
freeloader yeah

3035.46 --> 3041.7
he calls himself a consumer of what I do

3039.3 --> 3044.7000000000003
well he doesn't have consumer rights

3041.7 --> 3048.0589999999997
because he didn't buy my product

3044.7 --> 3051.24
understand he is just here freeloading

3048.059 --> 3053.1600000000003
not actually funding me just hanging

3051.24 --> 3057.4799999999996
around

3053.16 --> 3060.72
like people that go to game stores to

3057.48 --> 3064.02
play the game on the consoles there as a

3060.72 --> 3069.359
demonstration and then never buy a game

3064.02 --> 3072.2599999999998
yeah that's your consumer Behavior John

3069.359 --> 3072.2599999999998
925

3074.16 --> 3078.98
you don't have any consumer rights

3087.5 --> 3093.13
[Music]

3094.88 --> 3098.0
by the way

3098.94 --> 3103.38
should I pay someone who is insulting me

3101.22 --> 3106.2599999999998
on a regular basis

3103.38 --> 3109.8
oh maybe because

3106.26 --> 3111.5400000000004
you can learn something from it yeah

3109.8 --> 3113.94
did you know

3111.54 --> 3116.359
that there is actually a market for that

3113.94 --> 3116.359
out there

3116.88 --> 3121.1400000000003
and in weird territories even right

3119.94 --> 3125.339
there's

3121.14 --> 3127.02
there's people that hire specialists

3125.339 --> 3128.88
to

3127.02 --> 3132.839
insult them

3128.88 --> 3136.26
to make them experience fear or pain

3132.839 --> 3139.5589999999997
often people that are like really

3136.26 --> 3141.7200000000003
in high power places and everybody fears

3139.559 --> 3144.3590000000004
them so nobody ever dares to do anything

3141.72 --> 3146.04
bad to them and they kind of start

3144.359 --> 3148.74
craving

3146.04 --> 3151.38
for a more submissive position now this

3148.74 --> 3155.2799999999997
could grow sexual which is super gross

3151.38 --> 3157.38
but in general yeah a strict teacher can

3155.28 --> 3161.8190000000004
be abusive but they are the most

3157.38 --> 3164.88
effective so yeah yeah people pay other

3161.819 --> 3168.119
people to be what would appear to be

3164.88 --> 3171.5
abusive to them you know why because

3168.119 --> 3171.5
it's effective

3175.91 --> 3179.0299999999997
[Music]

3188.4 --> 3190.579

price

3201.36 --> 3204.429
[Music]

3207.78 --> 3211.6400000000003
wow logical conclusion

3212.46 --> 3216.02
is that your entry

3218.46 --> 3222.2400000000002
is that what you're going to be saying

3220.14 --> 3226.52
now because

3222.24 --> 3226.52
if your next comment isn't going to be

3227.22 --> 3231.35
useful productive after everything has

3229.98 --> 3233.579
happened you're banned

3231.35 --> 3237.24
[Music]

3233.579 --> 3240.0
the guy that's been hanging around and

3237.24 --> 3244.16
being oppositionally defined for months

3240.0 --> 3248.28
now suddenly can behave like a

3244.16 --> 3251.52
non-disgusting [ __ ] troll anymore

3248.28 --> 3254.0400000000004
so it's your last chance

3251.52 --> 3256.74
five minute timeout after that you

3254.04 --> 3258.24
better say something good and useful and

3256.74 --> 3261.9199999999996
something that everybody can learn

3258.24 --> 3261.9199999999996
something from or your band

3272.64 --> 3277.2599999999998
insults of accurate are welcomed by the

3275.04 --> 3279.68
gallery that's a good way to say it rest

3277.26 --> 3279.6800000000003
ahead

3279.9 --> 3282.5
right

3306.66 --> 3310.92
by the way did anybody watch gerunds

3309.359 --> 3314.16
yesterday

3310.92 --> 3316.44
at a very long show I was actually privy

3314.16 --> 3319.44
to watching it

3316.44 --> 3321.119
a big like dude it was going on like six

3319.44 --> 3324.059
hours probably or something I don't know

3321.119 --> 3327.079
how long it was but I watched a lot of

3324.059 --> 3327.079
it and it was really good

3327.42 --> 3330.38
state of the truth

3331.44 --> 3336.7200000000003
did anybody watch that I thought it was

3334.26 --> 3338.46
like really good made me sorry that I'm

3336.72 --> 3342.2
not

3338.46 --> 3342.2
able to comment in the chat

3345.119 --> 3347.6600000000003
foreign

3363.44 --> 3371.059
people that oh it's a four hour show he

3366.599 --> 3371.059
was like four hours right yeah

3371.16 --> 3375.5989999999997
I did see like a couple of people that I

3373.559 --> 3378.5
recognized over there in the chat like I

3375.599 --> 3380.599
think Adam price was there

3378.5 --> 3383.579
and

3380.599 --> 3386.76
Divergent Droid

3383.579 --> 3388.7400000000002
so it wasn't like everybody that I know

3386.76 --> 3390.9
from Flat Earth debate chats or whatever

3388.74 --> 3393.359
was banned there no

3390.9 --> 3397.4
but the

3393.359 --> 3397.4
some more safely batching yeah yeah

3397.619 --> 3401.76
I like it

3399.24 --> 3404.18
I'm sorry rastad I know that you seem to

3401.76 --> 3406.7990000000004
have really gone on to this bandwagon

3404.18 --> 3408.299
telling you it's a mistake but I'm not

3406.799 --> 3410.819
gonna push that on you you're gonna have

3408.299 --> 3413.88
to figure it out for yourself but I've

3410.819 --> 3416.4
made like very solid case

3413.88 --> 3420.0
on what the Mandela effect is in my

3416.4 --> 3422.28
opinion and how that works exactly in

3420.0 --> 3425.46
every single case and it seems like

3422.28 --> 3427.44
Jaron is like got the message maybe you

3425.46 --> 3429.359
figured it out completely by himself and

3427.44 --> 3430.859
came to the same conclusion or maybe he

3429.359 --> 3433.68
even like watched some of my

3430.859 --> 3435.119
explanations I don't know

3433.68 --> 3439.5
but

3435.119 --> 3442.2200000000003
he was like Yeah there with me

3439.5 --> 3442.22
I like that

3443.579 --> 3450.8590000000004
all right also I watched Star Wars 4.

3447.66 --> 3450.859
I watched it again

3451.26 --> 3456.42
and

3453.42 --> 3458.28
as like I was gonna as a follow-up from

3456.42 --> 3461.4
Rogue one

3458.28 --> 3463.799
what a different movie it is

3461.4 --> 3466.319
it is much more mystical mysterious

3463.799 --> 3468.18
which was it of course was the intro to

3466.319 --> 3472.319
the entire

3468.18 --> 3475.319
lore of Star Wars universe and all that

3472.319 --> 3477.96
but yeah I know I took note like of the

3475.319 --> 3479.04
silver leg and it really was silver all

3477.96 --> 3481.94
the way

3479.04 --> 3481.94
and

3482.339 --> 3487.0789999999997
yeah especially in the desert you

3485.099 --> 3489.2400000000002
couldn't see it because it was just

3487.079 --> 3491.7000000000003
reflecting the sand so it was always

3489.24 --> 3493.3599999999997
like this weird thing that you could

3491.7 --> 3495.0589999999997
sometimes take note of

3493.36 --> 3498.799
[Music]

3495.059 --> 3498.799
but yeah it really was silver

3501.599 --> 3507.02
I tried to like look out for other

3503.66 --> 3507.02
details as well

3507.15 --> 3509.75
[Music]

3508.38 --> 3512.9
ah

3509.75 --> 3512.9
[Music]

3513.119 --> 3518.7200000000003
I'm Audi all right

3515.52 --> 3518.72
like dude

3519.96 --> 3524.819
I get in resta

3522.0 --> 3526.619
there's so much of it right

3524.819 --> 3529.92
there's another thing out there though

3526.619 --> 3531.1800000000003
which there is so much of as well it's

3529.92 --> 3534.14
called

3531.18 --> 3534.14
ball Earth

3534.299 --> 3541.14
there's so much of it yeah fortunately

3538.92 --> 3544.2000000000003
that doesn't make it real

3541.14 --> 3548.4
and I think that the Mandela effects

3544.2 --> 3551.0989999999997
have been identified quite early on I

3548.4 --> 3555.059
think that uh what's his name again

3551.099 --> 3557.1600000000003
the father of all propaganda I think he

3555.059 --> 3560.76
that man

3557.16 --> 3562.94
and his associates already figured out

3560.76 --> 3565.2000000000003
that the Mind basically

3562.94 --> 3567.599
reforms things

3565.2 --> 3569.7
if it's imperfect what I explain right

3567.599 --> 3573.839
about the pyramid with the missing

3569.7 --> 3576.72
Capstone it's so jarring your mind as

3573.839 --> 3578.2799999999997
you're watching it it's like why isn't

3576.72 --> 3580.0789999999997
it why isn't it straight why isn't

3578.28 --> 3582.9
filled up but in your memory there's a

3580.079 --> 3583.6800000000003
chance that your mind is Gonna Fill it

3582.9 --> 3586.859
in

3583.68 --> 3589.14
to complete the missing Capstone in your

3586.859 --> 3591.9
memory and that's the Mandela effect I

3589.14 --> 3595.74
think it's already been identified

3591.9 --> 3598.26
like early 20th century and then started

3595.74 --> 3601.52
to become applied

3598.26 --> 3605.099
and I think that advertisers

3601.52 --> 3607.7599999999998
corporations that were doing that were

3605.099 --> 3607.76
actively

3607.859 --> 3613.44
trying to [ __ ] with people trying to

3610.02 --> 3616.5
test this knowledge

3613.44 --> 3618.359
and how it worked

3616.5 --> 3620.339
and I think that's what we're still

3618.359 --> 3622.98
dealing with

3620.339 --> 3624.119
because we were never informed about

3622.98 --> 3627.559
that

3624.119 --> 3627.559
as they were all doing it

3627.68 --> 3635.24
Black Tommy whatever

3630.72 --> 3635.24
dude don't be a savonier rest ahead

3644.46 --> 3649.02
yeah logical glitches it appears you're

3646.68 --> 3650.7
back that's right so let the next words

3649.02 --> 3652.2599999999998
out of your

3650.7 --> 3655.52
keyboard

3652.26 --> 3655.5200000000004
be productive

3667.619 --> 3675.48
you would do that's not the [ __ ] off man

3672.359 --> 3677.22
get the [ __ ] out of here you [ __ ]

3675.48 --> 3681.2

3677.22 --> 3681.2
[ __ ] off never come back

3682.559 --> 3687.6600000000003
that's what you're gonna say

3684.619 --> 3690.6600000000003
instant complaining whining

3687.66 --> 3693.72
I warned you now [ __ ] off

3690.66 --> 3697.22
you do that you get banned

3693.72 --> 3697.22
no more chances for you

3698.22 --> 3703.14
let that be your final conclusion

3713.24 --> 3718.74
yeah it's

3715.14 --> 3721.74
the mainstream

3718.74 --> 3725.22
cage fighting [ __ ] or whatever I don't

3721.74 --> 3727.6189999999997
care I don't watch that at all at all

3725.22 --> 3731.5789999999997
like ever

3727.619 --> 3734.119
like as in have ever watched it

3731.579 --> 3737.3590000000004
last time I watched any kind of supposed

3734.119 --> 3737.359
fighting stuff

3737.819 --> 3741.2
it's like the 90s

3742.38 --> 3747.54

3744.31 --> 3747.54
[Music]

3762.599 --> 3768.6600000000003
but yeah mom takes patch it's hard to

3765.66 --> 3771.0
like not know a name like that when he's

3768.66 --> 3774.96
constantly being shoved at the front

3771.0 --> 3777.72
line in papers and gospel and everything

3774.96 --> 3780.2400000000002
like you don't even have to know

3777.72 --> 3781.9199999999996
what fighting sport is and there's still

3780.24 --> 3783.1189999999997
a chance you're gonna recognize that

3781.92 --> 3786.6800000000003
name

3783.119 --> 3786.6800000000003

4010.099 --> 4012.94

4019.039 --> 4024.44
show though very short but

4021.92 --> 4026.359
maybe I'm gonna keep doing that if I

4024.44 --> 4028.88
just feel like uh

4026.359 --> 4031.339
I'm gonna just start late and do the

4028.88 --> 4033.02
show shorter it seems to kind of be

4031.339 --> 4035.44
effective

4033.02 --> 4035.44
right

4041.1 --> 4046.2799999999997
[Music]

4044.0 --> 4048.799
Ballers going wild yeah what they always

4046.28 --> 4051.02
go wild at the last moment right it's

4048.799 --> 4053.2
all intense anticipation because they're

4051.02 --> 4056.5389999999998
all like going through this

4053.2 --> 4059.359
ecstatic religious experience

4056.539 --> 4060.5
every time Nathan Oakley goes live it's

4059.359 --> 4062.72
like

4060.5 --> 4065.359
they all go into this like religious

4062.72 --> 4069.4399999999996
trends like oh

4065.359 --> 4072.38
oh we have to squirt to stop the flat

4069.44 --> 4074.66
earth oh let's

4072.38 --> 4077.2400000000002
spread out soar them out let everybody

4074.66 --> 4078.74
know Flat Earth is stupid quickly uh

4077.24 --> 4082.839
scramble

4078.74 --> 4082.839
it happens almost every time

4084.799 --> 4090.4
last half hour or suddenly always the

4087.079 --> 4090.4
Ballers come rolling in

4104.8 --> 4107.959
[Music]

4115.13 --> 4118.229
[Music]

4121.46 --> 4125.38
yeah any evidence yeah yeah

4131.659 --> 4134.199
right

4135.38 --> 4140.839
so

4137.38 --> 4142.819
Verizon still isn't geometric you still

4140.839 --> 4144.259
can't

4142.819 --> 4147.02
measure

4144.259 --> 4149.38
an elevation angle with the curve of the

4147.02 --> 4149.38
Json

4150.02 --> 4154.339000000001
still no

4151.659 --> 4155.9
coriolis deviation

4154.339 --> 4159.4
on Earth

4155.9 --> 4159.4
because the Earth is stationary

4160.819 --> 4166.6990000000005
it's still contained because

4164.239 --> 4168.5
gas pressure is going to expand to fill

4166.699 --> 4172.419999999999
the available volume

4168.5 --> 4172.42
before it can gradient out

4174.319 --> 4182.6
and yeah gas still does not have mass

4177.98 --> 4185.178999999999
while it's in its gaseous state

4182.6 --> 4188.679
which is kind of double right so all

4185.179 --> 4188.679
these points all still stand

4190.219 --> 4195.26
and no amount of complaining about how I

4193.52 --> 4198.4400000000005
conduct my

4195.26 --> 4201.320000000001
my moderating skills over my chat

4198.44 --> 4204.44
or how passionate I can get when

4201.32 --> 4208.099999999999
somebody's acting like a numpty [ __ ]

4204.44 --> 4211.54
is gonna change that those stated facts

4208.1 --> 4211.54
remain facts

4212.96 --> 4218.25
foreign

4215.07 --> 4218.25

4222.34 --> 4226.7

[Music]

4232.6 --> 4235.779
[Music]

4248.719 --> 4254.84
oh yeah by the way free voice

4252.26 --> 4256.88
Quantum of conscious had like pretty

4254.84 --> 4258.02
amazing show this Sunday as well almost

4256.88 --> 4259.9400000000005
forgot

4258.02 --> 4260.659000000001
definitely check that one out if you

4259.94 --> 4263.96
haven't

4260.659 --> 4265.58
about old money it's really really

4263.96 --> 4269.12
revealing

4265.58 --> 4271.94
it just put it right there in your face

4269.12 --> 4273.92
to really think about carefully I it was

4271.94 --> 4276.0199999999995
an amazing Quantum of conscious dude

4273.92 --> 4278.0
that guy

4276.02 --> 4279.14
he's getting better and better what he

4278.0 --> 4282.219
does

4279.14 --> 4282.219
it's amazing

4293.3 --> 4298.52
I wonder though like how does he

4295.58 --> 4300.86
actually spend his day does he watch a

4298.52 --> 4302.84
lot of people's videos

4300.86 --> 4303.92
he doesn't really talk about that too

4302.84 --> 4307.04
much

4303.92 --> 4309.32
but like to get to this kind of level of

4307.04 --> 4311.54
cohesive conclusion and presentation

4309.32 --> 4314.84
it's like

4311.54 --> 4316.64
it has to have some like real oversight

4314.84 --> 4319.52
over what's going on in order to get

4316.64 --> 4322.400000000001
that you have to actually

4319.52 --> 4324.5
see what's going on out there and like

4322.4 --> 4327.199
the frequency of it and how how it's

4324.5 --> 4328.58
changing over time so I yeah I don't

4327.199 --> 4331.099999999999
know

4328.58 --> 4333.739
would be pretty cool to

4331.1 --> 4335.79
be in contact with that guy

4333.739 --> 4339.239
maybe at some point

4335.79 --> 4339.239
[Music]

4340.28 --> 4349.239
oh hey thank you sick koi yeah ring

4345.98 --> 4349.239
I appreciate that

4350.96 --> 4356.06
yeah they are smart

4353.78 --> 4357.5
and they're all very they're smart in

4356.06 --> 4359.0
different ways

4357.5 --> 4361.82
right

4359.0 --> 4363.98
I mean I've had like friction with every

4361.82 --> 4367.28
one of them

4363.98 --> 4369.62
even see seeking star water a bit

4367.28 --> 4372.8
but they're all like

4369.62 --> 4375.32
such unique people

4372.8 --> 4378.860000000001
and it's like because we're all learning

4375.32 --> 4381.92
to to like be around one another

4378.86 --> 4385.339999999999
and not let the differences get to us

4381.92 --> 4388.6990000000005
it's like we can actually work together

4385.34 --> 4390.9800000000005
to reinforce the cohesion that we all

4388.699 --> 4394.339999999999
seek

4390.98 --> 4396.98
and still remain individuals

4394.34 --> 4400.1
and I really appreciate that

4396.98 --> 4403.48
like chocolates

4400.1 --> 4403.4800000000005
yeah so you can start order

4406.75 --> 4410.46
[Music]

4414.98 --> 4420.32
yeah no but I like especially George

4418.04 --> 4421.58
Sanford because we've had some friction

4420.32 --> 4424.159
together

4421.58 --> 4426.0199999999995
I mean he does have some opinions about

4424.159 --> 4430.699
some things that I really don't like

4426.02 --> 4433.219
just makes me feel icky but overall he's

4430.699 --> 4436.219
had such

4433.219 --> 4436.219
consistently

4436.46 --> 4443.06
High effort input like he does actually

4440.3 --> 4445.820000000001
make an effort to be serious

4443.06 --> 4449.02
about things and that that's

4445.82 --> 4449.0199999999995
I appreciate that

4450.26 --> 4454.58
right and rest ahead is like that too by

4452.84 --> 4457.1
the way but he is kind of like me

4454.58 --> 4459.14
extremely passionate maybe even more

4457.1 --> 4461.2390000000005
passionate almost out of control at

4459.14 --> 4462.860000000001
times and yeah look at me I'm out of

4461.239 --> 4464.0599999999995
control sometimes we'll freaking rest

4462.86 --> 4466.88
that man

4464.06 --> 4468.4400000000005
but he is

4466.88 --> 4470.2390000000005
more

4468.44 --> 4473.178999999999
practical

4470.239 --> 4476.239
than I am I am very much a theorist

4473.179 --> 4478.88
eraster hat is like a doer he actually

4476.239 --> 4480.799999999999
does a lot of things out there he's kind

4478.88 --> 4482.719
of ambitious in a way

4480.8 --> 4484.28
and in a good way

4482.719 --> 4486.44
right

4484.28 --> 4489.28
so we all have our character differences

4486.44 --> 4489.28
but together

4490.34 --> 4496.1
we all share the same

4494.0 --> 4498.8
goals

4496.1 --> 4501.38
on the long run and that really makes it

4498.8 --> 4504.04
work it really gives me like a sense of

4501.38 --> 4504.04
family even

4504.679 --> 4508.76
right but I'm gonna run out the show

4506.54 --> 4510.26
