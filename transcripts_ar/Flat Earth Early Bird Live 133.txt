5.42 --> 40.06
[Music]

35.94 --> 44.14
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.06 --> 50.400000000000006
early-bird number 133 I'm your host

44.14 --> 57.19
Arwen and today I have my new microphone

50.4 --> 68.05
haha its back and this time is here to

57.19 --> 72.52
stay so yeah and thanks to mostly the

68.05 --> 75.28
super chats falling through and me

72.52 --> 78.88
getting some extra cash available I've

75.28 --> 81.28
been able to buy this new microphone for

78.88 --> 83.77
the full price but yeah it still got it

81.28 --> 89.38
and then I figured out that the previous

83.77 --> 91.78
one was probably working so yeah that

89.38 --> 95.02
was a bit annoying to find out that I

91.78 --> 100.93
didn't even try it at the time but

95.02 --> 105.46
apparently the previous mic I used in a

100.93 --> 108.25
certain USB port and yeah because of

105.46 --> 110.67999999999999
that apparently the connection wasn't

108.25 --> 112.479
good and was kind of broken sound was

110.68 --> 115.09
broken the previous time I tried it I

112.479 --> 117.64
did with this one in the same USB port

115.09 --> 120.52000000000001
it did the same thing and then ranty

117.64 --> 123.43
suggested maybe tried in other USB ports

120.52 --> 126.90899999999999
so yeah I could have saved myself a lot

123.43 --> 130.66
of time and probably some money but now

126.909 --> 134.05
I know I have a broken USB port on my

130.66 --> 135.82
computer GUI but yeah at least I got the

134.05 --> 140.17000000000002
new mic I hope the sound is coming

135.82 --> 144.39
through loud and clear no idea I should

140.17 --> 144.39
probably go into the settings

145.099 --> 156.469
and get the mic back down to a hundred

148.379 --> 159.54
percent instead of 150 let's see okay so

156.469 --> 161.579
maybe I need to go a little bit closer

159.54 --> 169.34
to the mic now to have the same level of

161.579 --> 174.15
sound or I can move my mic closer to me

169.34 --> 181.53
right so you guys like the sound better

174.15 --> 185.04000000000002
like this or better as I started out you

181.53 --> 189.81
tell me anyway

185.04 --> 197.12
yeah the weather it's kind of gray not

189.81 --> 197.12
no rain grayish not the best of weathers

197.329 --> 201.829
that's not no wind or anything

216.48 --> 221.48999999999998
PewDiePie video quality isn't that bad

230.69 --> 247.25
hashtag MIFA so let's see everyone in

242.25 --> 247.25
chat who's there

248.12 --> 254.15
all right it's 101 rockhound bumbaclot

254.18 --> 261.6
gate oafish Julie Bennett bloody says

258.12 --> 264.9
Obama cool oh sure oh six righteous for

261.6 --> 267.41
Shane Walter Steve Voynich good to see

264.9 --> 267.40999999999997
all of you

272.29 --> 279.67
so yeah today's Saturday so it's gonna

275.74 --> 282.22
be potentially a longer episode but yeah

279.67 --> 285.13
that will require some panel member so

282.22 --> 286.59000000000003
anyone would like to join their very

285.13 --> 290.11
welcome

286.59 --> 293.94
hmm still need to put out the link for

290.11 --> 293.94
God see

308.16 --> 313.66
one thing that's really getting used to

310.72 --> 316.24
with this mic is that it's so big and it

313.66 --> 318.509
actually obstructs my view of my

316.24 --> 318.509
keyboard

328.26 --> 337.84999999999997
so yeah the link is put out in Scott

332.27 --> 341.49
yeah I have been having some persistent

337.85 --> 346.41
video problems with the Google hangout

341.49 --> 348.86
system though so yeah yesterday on in

346.41 --> 351.57000000000005
the Flat Earth debates I tried again and

348.86 --> 354.72
yeah half the time I just couldn't hear

351.57 --> 359.61
anyone else on the panel and it would be

354.72 --> 363.84000000000003
very random how the sound came in and

359.61 --> 367.14
out was very odd and I hope that that

363.84 --> 369.09
doesn't happen during my hangouts and if

367.14 --> 372.06
it does I think I'm gonna have to

369.09 --> 376.83
rearrange the setup and go to a pure

372.06 --> 379.68
Skype call based system where instead of

376.83 --> 385.62
used Google Hangouts use Google's of use

379.68 --> 387.63
Skype and well since all of you all of

385.62 --> 389.55
my contacts and all the panel members

387.63 --> 392.31
are on skype anyway that shouldn't be

389.55 --> 397.88
too difficult to achieve just need to

392.31 --> 400.53000000000003
rearrange a couple of things in OBS yeah

397.88 --> 405.63
what you're missing the good old

400.53 --> 407.84999999999997
fashioned scratchy sound like an old

405.63 --> 410.75
record player playing in the background

407.85 --> 410.75
constantly

414.85 --> 419.14000000000004
[Music]

416.19 --> 426.67
all right but yeah I really am curious

419.14 --> 429.55
to how this this microphone sounds from

426.67 --> 433.99
the first time I tried and it failed

429.55 --> 435.49
because that USB port I did kind of

433.99 --> 440.25
liked the sound of it but it was so

435.49 --> 440.25
going in and out that was just a mess

447.03 --> 450.28
see

448.24 --> 454.27
so something you've been complaining

450.28 --> 459.07
about all this time when the time comes

454.27 --> 460.65999999999997
for that to stay in the past sadly for

459.07 --> 462.31
the weirdest reasons you'll still get

460.66 --> 465.31
nostalgic about it even though you've

462.31 --> 468.52
hated it all the time where it isn't it

465.31 --> 471.91
how that works people get attached to

468.52 --> 485.01
their to the habits and things that are

471.91 --> 485.01000000000005
persistent at complain indeed God

488.509 --> 495.249
in these last this last day all together

492.02 --> 498.65
has been quite annoying to me personally

495.249 --> 504.34900000000005
but it's because of the stacking up of

498.65 --> 507.919
just mistakes like on-the-fly mistakes

504.349 --> 512.169
that I seem to make how to know we're

507.919 --> 515.36
just being distracted or something and

512.169 --> 519.529
it really annoys me when I make mistakes

515.36 --> 523.36
like so bad get really pissed off at

519.529 --> 526.18
myself and then when they happen a

523.36 --> 531.73
surface subsequently

526.18 --> 531.7299999999999
then yeah I get can get quite pissed off

532.899 --> 541.699
so I need to just calm down try to

537.589 --> 546.769
refocus and you enjoy the new things I

541.699 --> 549.649
got the new mic the new clothes I had

546.769 --> 551.839
this year I just fixed a couple of

549.649 --> 553.399
details of my bike which were very

551.839 --> 557.4490000000001
necessary because it was getting

553.399 --> 559.519
crackling crackling old sounding like it

557.449 --> 562.16
would break down any second now it's

559.519 --> 566.6
perfectly smooth I just need to enjoy

562.16 --> 568.959
the new setting and move on keep on

566.6 --> 568.9590000000001
going

581.43 --> 589.4899999999999
what do you want Lottie are you being

586.53 --> 589.49
such a whiny [ __ ]

604.61 --> 622.04
yeah by the way like in my friend circle

610.79 --> 627.16
of the gamers it's these people you know

622.04 --> 630.5889999999999
I I really appreciate their skills and

627.16 --> 636.319
their their sense of humor is good I

630.589 --> 641.749
like it but they're such enthusiasts

636.319 --> 643.519
leftists sometimes and when they get

641.749 --> 648.2900000000001
first traded things go completely

643.519 --> 652.189
overboard insane in just impulsive

648.29 --> 654.98
behavior stuff no they had nothing to

652.189 --> 658.519
yeah only mental basically not nothing

654.98 --> 662.059
physical but God yesterday again I just

658.519 --> 667.009
had to sometimes just sit there and say

662.059 --> 669.649
like like come on this is too far this

667.009 --> 678.549
is just not funny anymore and they

669.649 --> 681.559
ignored it just went on a rampage but

678.549 --> 683.779
yeah just the way they they let these

681.559 --> 689.35
characters of theirs manifest and just

683.779 --> 693.549
do quite insane over-the-top things if I

689.35 --> 693.549
can drive me nuts sometimes

707.91 --> 713.9499999999999
lotty stop whining - really

711.22 --> 719.38
childish and annoying and you know it's

713.95 --> 724.0600000000001
not censoring timing you out it's not

719.38 --> 729.43
censoring you still visible in the in

724.06 --> 732.25
the in the chat over there before I time

729.43 --> 737.04
you out so yeah stop

732.25 --> 737.04
stop complaining about nonsense please

744.74 --> 748.21
so what's happening

769.66 --> 772.99
ya got

777.92 --> 784.9699999999999
it seems to give me yeah it seems to get

780.37 --> 788.9
ya there is some feedback on the Logan

784.97 --> 793.01
Paul movie thingy going around and I

788.9 --> 796.25
don't know it's not good and I've even

793.01 --> 798.91
noticed some stepping up of ridicule

796.25 --> 802.27
within Alex yeah within the Infowars

798.91 --> 806.8
here and there which was kind of

802.27 --> 806.8
disappointing so

812.29 --> 821.01
I don't know what'll be next I just he

817.99 --> 824.05
seems to have muddied the water somewhat

821.01 --> 826.24
and we're getting more ridicule now I

824.05 --> 828.6999999999999
think I don't know how long that's gonna

826.24 --> 831.8100000000001
last probably not too long movie was not

828.7 --> 831.8100000000001
that impressive at all

839.35 --> 842.07
what

847.57 --> 855.57
hello Nathan all right PJ I don't know

852.459 --> 860.2299999999999
about crow triple sevens reflective sky

855.57 --> 863.11
look I don't follow him okay I haven't

860.23 --> 865.63
for a long time really I did hear he was

863.11 --> 869.019
on iron real media and I did follow some

865.63 --> 871.62
of that but yeah after some time I just

869.019 --> 871.62
so now

873.27 --> 876.4499999999999
[Music]

884.52 --> 887.52
tt1

894.49 --> 902.17
okay bumbaclot ghetto fish I didn't

898.93 --> 905.1099999999999
really break away from crow look he's

902.17 --> 907.9
been there he's from the old guard okay

905.11 --> 912.52
he's from the first wave so he's been

907.9 --> 917.29
there forever and again I highly respect

912.52 --> 923.05
the moon ripple thing that was very old

917.29 --> 925.78
so but yeah he is he rambles on and he

923.05 --> 931.8599999999999
just doesn't stop and he gets in to

925.78 --> 931.86
gematria stuff and I don't know

939.78 --> 945.48
I don't get the feeling he's very

941.91 --> 952.4699999999999
level-headed and he tries to make

945.48 --> 960.15
interesting stories rather than yeah

952.47 --> 962.52
then then track to make sense of what is

960.15 --> 966.9599999999999
already there that I don't know that's

962.52 --> 970.9499999999999
just my feeling of it mostly yeah I'd

966.96 --> 973.47
have to go into literal examples - yeah

970.95 --> 976.2
to show where I feel the problems are

973.47 --> 983.64
but yeah he's a great storyteller but I

976.2 --> 988.32
don't know I've rarely gotten data from

983.64 --> 993.02
crow that that stuck that I thought was

988.32 --> 993.0200000000001
super useful so I don't know

1003.87 --> 1010.76
what are you talking about his diversity

1006.8 --> 1010.76
what diversity

1039.89 --> 1042.669
we

1047.199 --> 1055.299
what are you talking about please share

1051.389 --> 1057.879
seriously you think that it's Robbie

1055.299 --> 1061.33
Davidson mark Sargent and Patricia

1057.879 --> 1066.149
stairs fault of these mockumentaries

1061.33 --> 1066.149
really so what is their faults

1073.0 --> 1078.69
look for everything that they've put out

1076.299 --> 1083.65
I think they've done a pretty decent job

1078.69 --> 1086.3700000000001
just they didn't have control I know

1083.65 --> 1086.3700000000001
he's baiting me

1092.1 --> 1095.76
shut up from birth

1095.85 --> 1099.05
[Music]

1119.77 --> 1131.02
right yeah well that's the stories have

1125.62 --> 1134.62
been misconstrued so if you can be more

1131.02 --> 1137.05
specific about which stories it happens

1134.62 --> 1141.2099999999998
in Hollywood absolutely they screw

1137.05 --> 1144.19
around with all kinds of knowledge and

1141.21 --> 1147.16
stories and trying to mix it up

1144.19 --> 1151.74
politicize it and beyond recognition

1147.16 --> 1151.74
basically so yeah

1152.07 --> 1159.53
are you still referring to crow triple7

1156.52 --> 1163.079
or to the mockumentary

1159.53 --> 1163.079
[Music]

1167.38 --> 1170.5990000000002
[Music]

1196.67 --> 1205.5800000000002
right well look a mockumentary about

1202.85 --> 1208.84
flat earth is very easily made because

1205.58 --> 1211.97
there is the first response programming

1208.84 --> 1213.62
that everybody is culturally added the

1211.97 --> 1217.97
cultural narrative that nobody's

1213.62 --> 1219.9499999999998
stepping away from or a lot of people

1217.97 --> 1222.53
aren't stepping away from it's very much

1219.95 --> 1225.19
like the mainstream news versus the

1222.53 --> 1227.75
alternative news there's a lot of people

1225.19 --> 1230.3600000000001
that really do go with the mainstream

1227.75 --> 1232.31
even though they know it's probably lies

1230.36 --> 1237.4699999999998
or insane and they don't really get into

1232.31 --> 1240.59
it and then there's quite a sizable

1237.47 --> 1242.72
number of people by now that do reject

1240.59 --> 1247.1599999999999
it and go to the alternative news and

1242.72 --> 1254.3600000000001
well for flat earth that threshold is

1247.16 --> 1257.69
just higher and yeah thus as a wider

1254.36 --> 1261.02
audience movie it's very easy to make a

1257.69 --> 1263.15
flat flat earth mockumentary because

1261.02 --> 1265.73
people will have the first response of a

1263.15 --> 1267.6200000000001
really flat earthers and then so yeah

1265.73 --> 1274.73
the movie makers only have to play into

1267.62 --> 1276.86
that and yeah done very easily because

1274.73 --> 1279.32
everybody already is pre-programmed with

1276.86 --> 1283.2199999999998
the standard response and you have to

1279.32 --> 1286.28
actually yeah bypass that actively in

1283.22 --> 1289.7
the movie design to show that flat

1286.28 --> 1292.49
earthers are actually real normal people

1289.7 --> 1296.42
with normal motivations and everything

1292.49 --> 1298.55
and don't mean any harm and more about

1296.42 --> 1301.46
where it's coming from and how it works

1298.55 --> 1305.3
psychological effects and everything but

1301.46 --> 1309.17
yeah mainstream news groups and media

1305.3 --> 1314.1699999999998
groups aren't gonna do that because they

1309.17 --> 1314.17
depends on the globe

1320.7 --> 1323.839
[Music]

1326.99 --> 1337.64
mmm no psychopomp asks do you think the

1336.02 --> 1344.86
globe was created so they could fake

1337.64 --> 1349.1000000000001
aliens well no I think aliens were

1344.86 --> 1355.9089999999999
created to continue ate the globe

1349.1 --> 1360.1
mythology to continue to perpetuate it

1355.909 --> 1370.0390000000002
to move it further deeper add another

1360.1 --> 1373.6
elements to it to continue with because

1370.039 --> 1376.1
yeah aliens they used to be called

1373.6 --> 1381.1299999999999
there's all kinds of historical

1376.1 --> 1385.399
references to genes and genies and

1381.13 --> 1390.529
forest spirits and yeah

1385.399 --> 1392.33
demons dream creatures you know so now

1390.529 --> 1396.83
yeah this is just a migration towards

1392.33 --> 1401.33
okay aliens because any non-physical

1396.83 --> 1405.9499999999998
entity manifestation that represents

1401.33 --> 1409.1899999999998
itself to a human's mind in whatever way

1405.95 --> 1411.6200000000001
is going to reflect itself upon the

1409.19 --> 1414.95
cultural views and feelings of that

1411.62 --> 1422.27
person's knowledge and their experiences

1414.95 --> 1425.0
so yeah you if you know this then you

1422.27 --> 1427.8799999999999
could basically put that to your hand

1425.0 --> 1432.61
and create mythologies about aliens and

1427.88 --> 1438.169
then in some way try to use that

1432.61 --> 1441.1689999999999
manifest aliens as a spiritual construct

1438.169 --> 1446.38
of creature whatever earth as a skin I

1441.169 --> 1446.38
don't know it just seems logical to me

1475.37 --> 1477.9099999999999
No

1478.47 --> 1486.6000000000001
hello conspiracy cats how long before I

1483.72 --> 1492.1490000000001
kick you depends um yeah if you're gonna

1486.6 --> 1494.4289999999999
be an ass or just a visitor don't have

1492.149 --> 1496.7589999999998
any reason to kick you really at this

1494.429 --> 1496.759
point

1526.269 --> 1531.39
hmm

1528.5 --> 1534.03
[Music]

1531.39 --> 1541.5300000000002
right

1534.03 --> 1545.04
or psychopomp the alien invasion I don't

1541.53 --> 1559.08
know many things could be done with a

1545.04 --> 1561.96
concept it could be some kind of dream

1559.08 --> 1564.54
event maybe dark world event I would

1561.96 --> 1569.51
call it and then do something with

1564.54 --> 1573.54
aliens like a big collective dream or

1569.51 --> 1576.99
just use a narrative like ooh aliens are

1573.54 --> 1582.0
invading have a bunch of CGI to support

1576.99 --> 1587.81
it and basically have a fake enemy to

1582.0 --> 1589.68
perpetuate a a war industry with be like

1587.81 --> 1592.62
final resort to keep the

1589.68 --> 1595.2
military-industrial complex going and of

1592.62 --> 1604.35
course it would be their creation it's

1595.2 --> 1608.27
very logical very systematic and well

1604.35 --> 1611.82
yeah alien false flags could happen even

1608.27 --> 1616.3799999999999
so would be like military in alien suits

1611.82 --> 1618.81
and then doing damage yeah that kind of

1616.38 --> 1621.69
[ __ ] you know they could go anywhere

1618.81 --> 1623.76
with it that's yeah that's just how it

1621.69 --> 1627.44
is don't know if they're gonna do that

1623.76 --> 1632.01
but they could things heat up enough and

1627.44 --> 1634.65
if we lose too much grip if they just

1632.01 --> 1637.35
gain complete control over everything

1634.65 --> 1642.42
and people don't protest protest then

1637.35 --> 1645.7099999999998
yeah they will go loose they will start

1642.42 --> 1645.71
to pull out all the tricks

1649.44 --> 1662.29
right a removal Project Blue Beam is

1652.75 --> 1665.71
kind of outdated it's it could have

1662.29 --> 1670.03
worked like in the 90s but now everyone

1665.71 --> 1673.69
has cameras has there's so much CJ CGI

1670.03 --> 1677.11
capabilities it's much it's much easier

1673.69 --> 1679.54
to just fake it more like a world of the

1677.11 --> 1685.1999999999998
world style but with video media

1679.54 --> 1687.57
included and more careful more organized

1685.2 --> 1689.14
widespread not just a singular thing

1687.57 --> 1693.61
something like that

1689.14 --> 1695.71
you don't need Project Blue Beam because

1693.61 --> 1698.1699999999998
yeah you could do all kinds of visual

1695.71 --> 1704.89
effects with that atmospheric visuals

1698.17 --> 1706.72
but people there's so much [ __ ] out

1704.89 --> 1708.49
there now so many weird things that

1706.72 --> 1712.68
people are just gonna look like oh wow

1708.49 --> 1712.68
there's they're doing something weird

1713.28 --> 1721.18
and that's it because yeah the media is

1718.33 --> 1723.3999999999999
bombarding us with crazy overkill

1721.18 --> 1725.8
suggestions about what's about to happen

1723.4 --> 1732.94
or things that supposedly have happened

1725.8 --> 1738.58
recently celestial events bla political

1732.94 --> 1741.79
threats all that so people just get numb

1738.58 --> 1743.1399999999999
down by that I think and they'll just

1741.79 --> 1745.27
see like oh there's something happening

1743.14 --> 1748.71
okay what's everybody going to say about

1745.27 --> 1748.71
what it's supposed to be

1758.33 --> 1766.33
all right for an itch yeah the whole

1764.23 --> 1770.57
aftermath situation in New Zealand

1766.33 --> 1774.56
really saddens me they'd a completely

1770.57 --> 1778.55
went on for a full Marxist and gun

1774.56 --> 1781.55
control are not not for Marxist I guess

1778.55 --> 1786.77
but definitely that direction and just

1781.55 --> 1792.9199999999998
being almost Americanized leftist and

1786.77 --> 1796.04
that's just really disappointing there

1792.92 --> 1798.23
it's like going over Q signal against

1796.04 --> 1803.69
Islam like what are you doing

1798.23 --> 1806.81
it's crazy you know apologize to the

1803.69 --> 1812.5700000000002
people but don't go apologizing to a

1806.81 --> 1816.08
religion it's nuts these people most

1812.57 --> 1819.62
likely have been going to New Zealand to

1816.08 --> 1830.11
isolate themselves from the rest of that

1819.62 --> 1830.11
whole religion that just pisses me off

1844.18 --> 1853.21
all right yep they fell for it butts

1848.17 --> 1859.89
also because they're just they were not

1853.21 --> 1862.69
prepared at all the public I mean and

1859.89 --> 1864.8200000000002
yeah probably the intelligence and

1862.69 --> 1870.46
police were very capable of dealing with

1864.82 --> 1873.85
this but the public obviously wasn't

1870.46 --> 1875.98
they were very much used to a kind of

1873.85 --> 1879.1
safe space set up for their entire

1875.98 --> 1882.52
country so they they're all out of whack

1879.1 --> 1887.1999999999998
because of what happened and the leftist

1882.52 --> 1889.54
agenda people abused it to the its

1887.2 --> 1891.93
maximum potential and it's just really

1889.54 --> 1891.93
aggravating

1915.44 --> 1925.15
all right and at the same time while all

1918.71 --> 1930.97
that happens and the Dutch situation I

1925.15 --> 1930.97
was like a vigil yesterday apparently I

1931.06 --> 1937.1
heard that total eventually three people

1934.7 --> 1940.1200000000001
died so that that was kind of a little

1937.1 --> 1944.62
shock I just thought was the one person

1940.12 --> 1952.37
but apparently two others died as well

1944.62 --> 1956.75
yeah it's not good but it's just being

1952.37 --> 1959.7199999999998
so height and at the same time yeah in

1956.75 --> 1963.98
other countries there's other there's

1959.72 --> 1966.98
like suicide bombings and [ __ ] and like

1963.98 --> 1973.6
a lot of Christian groups are getting

1966.98 --> 1976.84
targeted and nobody talks about that and

1973.6 --> 1981.11
that's been going on for a long time

1976.84 --> 1983.1799999999998
it's like you don't really hear media

1981.11 --> 1986.6899999999998
complaining about Christians being

1983.18 --> 1990.43
killed or being attacked they just don't

1986.69 --> 1992.8400000000001
talk about it well there's something

1990.43 --> 1996.01
like well we have when a mosque is

1992.84 --> 2002.59
attacked then suddenly it's everywhere

1996.01 --> 2007.6
there's some somebody painted a some

2002.59 --> 2010.9599999999998
some Nazi thing on a Jewish synagogue or

2007.6 --> 2013.36
a grave situation that and that's also

2010.96 --> 2017.05
completely over the news it's just so

2013.36 --> 2021.01
religiously biased how the media treats

2017.05 --> 2023.19
with what happens in the world I find it

2021.01 --> 2023.19
repulsive

2042.68 --> 2047.98
I have no idea what you're talking about

2045.5 --> 2047.98
chain

2057.41 --> 2060.7
no idea

2074.64 --> 2080.18
yep voyage that pretty much the gist of

2078.06 --> 2080.18
it

2111.68 --> 2131.71
my god B seriously dude that's just sick

2122.75 --> 2131.71
man he can't be serious

2139.7 --> 2147.6189999999997
all right yeah I'm kind of worried too

2143.059 --> 2150.53
about yeah our place on the Internet as

2147.619 --> 2153.099
flat earthers as the pressure amps up

2150.53 --> 2153.099
and

2161.849 --> 2168.6600000000003
I don't know look weed we have a lot of

2165.869 --> 2173.2490000000003
people we have a lot of willing people

2168.66 --> 2176.0389999999998
willing to do this but we don't have a

2173.249 --> 2177.7189999999996
lot of media control so they could try

2176.039 --> 2181.829
to push us out of the way and it's going

2177.719 --> 2186.109
to be very tough especially if Big Tex

2181.829 --> 2189.989
jumps in and starts to treat us like

2186.109 --> 2193.14
we're like Trump supporters because yeah

2189.989 --> 2197.039
that sounds really silly but they have

2193.14 --> 2199.709
been heavily assaulted media wise and

2197.039 --> 2202.349
social media in the last year now and

2199.709 --> 2204.1499999999996
don't underestimate that it's really

2202.349 --> 2208.349
happening they really get accounts

2204.15 --> 2211.6800000000003
deleted all that [ __ ] and yeah Flat

2208.349 --> 2215.309
Earth does get censored as well in

2211.68 --> 2217.739
social media but that's because it's

2215.309 --> 2221.88
yeah sometimes it feels out of place all

2217.739 --> 2224.66
that but if if the companies themselves

2221.88 --> 2232.049
are like really gonna push it aside

2224.66 --> 2233.64
strangle it then yeah what do we do it's

2232.049 --> 2238.44
got to be careful and I think that they

2233.64 --> 2240.959
that they will try to get rough with us

2238.44 --> 2243.14
and I don't really know what to do about

2240.959 --> 2243.14
it

2245.93 --> 2251.0
except well maybe try to find other

2248.51 --> 2255.9500000000003
platforms lighter platforms but yeah

2251.0 --> 2272.54
that's gonna take away a lot of the

2255.95 --> 2275.6
reach that we do have so yeah I think we

2272.54 --> 2279.5
just all need to stay strong and keep on

2275.6 --> 2286.46
going and try to take a lot of what is

2279.5 --> 2291.23
happening out there for bluff but yeah

2286.46 --> 2294.11
it's it's like staying vigilant so much

2291.23 --> 2297.44
what could be said and done and suggest

2294.11 --> 2302.54
it could just be pure Bluff cuz it's

2297.44 --> 2305.18
easy to do but you can't always by

2302.54 --> 2308.57
default then start disbelieving

2305.18 --> 2314.5899999999997
everything because then you make then

2308.57 --> 2319.4300000000003
you actually make mistakes but always be

2314.59 --> 2322.7000000000003
be careful be principled the stick to

2319.43 --> 2328.2799999999997
your principles stick to the good

2322.7 --> 2330.77
methodology and just keep on going and

2328.28 --> 2335.3
try to pay attention to what's going on

2330.77 --> 2338.609
and adapt a little but not too much

2335.3 --> 2338.6090000000004
[Music]

2339.37 --> 2346.5099999999998
right yeah it's very important to do

2342.91 --> 2353.98
know who your neighbors are to to get a

2346.51 --> 2355.96
glimpse and assess reliability in other

2353.98 --> 2358.41
situations so you just know what you got

2355.96 --> 2358.41
around you

2366.21 --> 2373.509
right and it is kind of a bollocks

2368.829 --> 2375.2490000000003
that's Nathan says but only if the

2373.509 --> 2380.41
Internet just completely shuts down

2375.249 --> 2381.39
that's the case but that's just never

2380.41 --> 2384.22
gonna happen

2381.39 --> 2386.14
not like that maybe the freedom of the

2384.22 --> 2390.819
Internet will go down but the internet

2386.14 --> 2394.42
will not go down because the mega

2390.819 --> 2401.44
corporations have become dependent on

2394.42 --> 2403.2690000000002
the internet so it's much more likely

2401.44 --> 2406.599
they'll just try to implement an

2403.269 --> 2415.089
Internet - system where corporations get

2406.599 --> 2417.1600000000003
full censorship control and yeah can

2415.089 --> 2420.3089999999997
play with the levers to manipulate and

2417.16 --> 2422.3799999999997
stimulate or discourage people for

2420.309 --> 2425.559
whatever reasons be political or just

2422.38 --> 2428.4100000000003
financial they can be wholly karke oleg

2425.559 --> 2430.059
arcs of the internet that way and that's

2428.41 --> 2435.45
exactly what they want because they want

2430.059 --> 2435.4500000000003
neo feudalism corporatist neo feudalism

2440.98 --> 2448.2
but it all starts with censorship first

2444.03 --> 2454.5600000000004
silencing the opposition silencing anti

2448.2 --> 2454.56
autocratic groups the real ones not

2457.05 --> 2464.619
right

2458.44 --> 2473.56
internet disconnect I think I was there

2464.619 --> 2475.78
on time right still going yeah good yeah

2473.56 --> 2477.31
that you're a t-shirt be down now it's

2475.78 --> 2479.4
actually the internet connection that

2477.31 --> 2484.5299999999997
goes through the electricity net and

2479.4 --> 2487.78
sometimes it starts to get disrupted

2484.53 --> 2489.4900000000002
don't know why exactly maybe just it's

2487.78 --> 2491.4700000000003
just the device it works pretty well

2489.49 --> 2496.089
overall but sometimes it just get

2491.47 --> 2501.39
disconnected and sometimes really bad no

2496.089 --> 2501.39
not the phone bill no it's all free

2504.099 --> 2519.489
I have no phone bill thank God that I

2515.859 --> 2522.64
don't use Wi-Fi Nathan but thanks

2519.489 --> 2525.099
smash this super chair anyway that don't

2522.64 --> 2533.199
use Wi-Fi I never will because I'm

2525.099 --> 2537.779
allergic to that [ __ ] I am for a wired

2533.199 --> 2544.2090000000003
internet world wires everywhere nothing

2537.779 --> 2547.559
no Wi-Fi no wireless me it'll be much

2544.209 --> 2551.0789999999997
healthier and much cheaper as well and

2547.559 --> 2555.029
ya won't damage nature and everyone's

2551.079 --> 2555.029
health as much because it does

2557.03 --> 2560.099
[Music]

2584.079 --> 2591.559
so hate my pen'll still open anyone

2588.71 --> 2596.39
wants to come on maybe talk about flat

2591.559 --> 2598.01
earth gravity or whatever you want or

2596.39 --> 2600.7
some discussion you want to have some

2598.01 --> 2603.349
feedback on that happened earlier

2600.7 --> 2608.779
because I'm not keeping a lot of track

2603.349 --> 2611.15
these days I should probably do that

2608.779 --> 2613.4
more but my attention isn't just not

2611.15 --> 2616.76
there as much I don't know what it is

2613.4 --> 2621.2000000000003
maybe it's overload I just can't keep my

2616.76 --> 2625.01
focus very well and I actually have

2621.2 --> 2630.6189999999997
sense a sense that like I want to get

2625.01 --> 2635.1400000000003
away from a lot the only way I think I

2630.619 --> 2635.1400000000003
could utilize that in a good way is by

2635.5 --> 2643.73
well having a p900 would help and then

2639.799 --> 2645.89
just go somewhere else and do some do

2643.73 --> 2649.63
some footage with it or something that

2645.89 --> 2649.6299999999997
will do me some good to get out of here

2650.68 --> 2655.0299999999997
because

2651.78 --> 2655.03
[Music]

2656.21 --> 2663.27
I need to get away from all this media

2659.72 --> 2667.1299999999997
stuff that's happening it's too much

2663.27 --> 2667.13
[Music]

2671.78 --> 2677.34
[Music]

2694.63 --> 2701.099
not there's snow there and glass Shaw

2702.269 --> 2706.2
where where are you

2728.24 --> 2731.2
all right

2745.72 --> 2754.75
so yeah how is the mic holding up they

2750.4 --> 2758.77
have trouble with pop sounds a lot do

2754.75 --> 2761.86
you hear me breathing in the mic that

2758.77 --> 2765.94
kind of thing or is that not an issue

2761.86 --> 2766.96
either would be good to know now I will

2765.94 --> 2769.36
hear it afterwards

2766.96 --> 2772.27
anyway definitely gonna listen back to

2769.36 --> 2774.63
today's early bird just to see how it

2772.27 --> 2774.63
sounded

2784.089 --> 2788.099
yeah thanks guys

2794.27 --> 2797.27
yeah

2798.22 --> 2805.109
and how are you hearing stuff happening

2801.34 --> 2805.109
outside can actually hear the cars

2829.12 --> 2835.15
I do see some activity being picked up

2832.03 --> 2840.5800000000004
but yeah very slightly it's what I

2835.15 --> 2844.81
thought if I put up the reach of this

2840.58 --> 2847.44
thing the game then I could use it as a

2844.81 --> 2851.11
listening device and you could probably

2847.44 --> 2852.9700000000003
hear details of people working over

2851.11 --> 2855.9700000000003
there with tools like hundreds of meters

2852.97 --> 2859.8599999999997
away with this thing but yeah I think I

2855.97 --> 2859.8599999999997
got the game pretty much right this way

2868.369 --> 2874.5190000000002
yeah it's a pretty funny idea by the way

2871.16 --> 2879.3489999999997
that if I combine like this Mike with

2874.519 --> 2882.4399999999996
its high game and a p900 then yeah you

2879.349 --> 2887.9300000000003
could potentially use it as a spying

2882.44 --> 2889.7000000000003
device that's right but it's really

2887.93 --> 2892.45
impressive when it can pick up an

2889.7 --> 2892.45
amazing

2917.75 --> 2925.02
mmm but yeah do you guys think I should

2920.91 --> 2928.91
put a pop filter on this thing or isn't

2925.02 --> 2928.91
it is that not a necessary

2937.16 --> 2947.8089999999997
right yeah ATM I don't know they could

2940.94 --> 2950.65
be I have to actually ask and see what

2947.809 --> 2950.65
they say about it

2960.87 --> 2973.5
don't need hmm okay cool awesome mmm but

2970.56 --> 2976.37
yeah I am probably gonna buy a what is

2973.5 --> 2980.57
it I'm a flexible mic stand

2976.37 --> 2983.49
so did ya this thing is kind of heavy

2980.57 --> 2988.2000000000003
would be good to have it like on a arm

2983.49 --> 2990.5099999999998
that I could just grab over and then I

2988.2 --> 2993.66
could do more with my table because I

2990.51 --> 2996.75
know this is red resonating terribly

2993.66 --> 2998.49
with the mic so that's why I try to stay

2996.75 --> 3000.47
away from my keyboard as much as

2998.49 --> 3003.08
possible and there is a mute button on

3000.47 --> 3005.89
it if I really have to do something so

3003.08 --> 3005.89
that's kind of handy

3012.15 --> 3017.329
what

3014.19 --> 3017.329
[Music]

3035.52 --> 3042.33
yeah movin on up slowly but steadily

3038.58 --> 3045.48
it's been a while so yeah I'm glad I got

3042.33 --> 3047.85
this new mic I already had a pretty good

3045.48 --> 3050.61
webcam I'm very satisfied with it

3047.85 --> 3054.15
over the years I got it early on and

3050.61 --> 3058.11
like my third hangout ever and it's

3054.15 --> 3061.7000000000003
doing great it yeah for the price it

3058.11 --> 3065.94
cost me almost nothing I think it was it

3061.7 --> 3070.02
40 40 50 euros or something it's really

3065.94 --> 3072.9900000000002
good I really like it yeah you could do

3070.02 --> 3075.59
better but I I don't need anything

3072.99 --> 3075.5899999999997
better than this

3080.36 --> 3088.61
okay Flat Earth vegetable look when I

3085.1 --> 3092.6
say I'm allergic to Wi-Fi I don't mean

3088.61 --> 3097.13
literally but I am hypersensitive to

3092.6 --> 3100.04
electric and sound related things like

3097.13 --> 3104.33
it can be really disruptive for example

3100.04 --> 3108.44
yesterday when I came arrived at the

3104.33 --> 3110.39
house where we did the D&D session for

3108.44 --> 3115.54
some reason and nobody could explain

3110.39 --> 3118.4
there was this weird resonant sound

3115.54 --> 3123.02
happening irregularly all over the house

3118.4 --> 3125.54
like terrible now hum that would

3123.02 --> 3128.5099999999998
resonate literally with my bones like

3125.54 --> 3131.24
you couldn't escape it that even at some

3128.51 --> 3133.5200000000004
points put your hand on the floor or on

3131.24 --> 3136.4599999999996
the side and just feel it vibrate from

3133.52 --> 3139.61
that thrilling thing and that's terrible

3136.46 --> 3143.09
I don't know what it was probably some

3139.61 --> 3145.4900000000002
machine but yeah things like having a

3143.09 --> 3150.5
lot of phones with Wi-Fi around me

3145.49 --> 3157.85
active doing things or ooh yeah that it

3150.5 --> 3161.12
disrupts me it it agitates mentally as

3157.85 --> 3163.91
well as my skin eventually when I get

3161.12 --> 3167.5
that too much and that's always been

3163.91 --> 3171.1099999999997
that way that was even in the 90s and

3167.5 --> 3175.18
yeah it's known to be the cancer

3171.11 --> 3179.7400000000002
inducing and can give you Hart's

3175.18 --> 3186.71
disruption heart activity disruption so

3179.74 --> 3189.02
yeah I just don't use wireless things I

3186.71 --> 3192.17
don't need to I don't like to and it's

3189.02 --> 3195.65
unhealthy and been like that for a long

3192.17 --> 3197.9300000000003
time yeah and it'll be a lot worse with

3195.65 --> 3201.08
5g so I'm not looking forward to that at

3197.93 --> 3206.4199999999996
all and I'm actually doing everything I

3201.08 --> 3208.75
can to basically discourage that or as I

3206.42 --> 3215.349
like to say everybody get a

3208.75 --> 3218.19
a grinder cutter because 5ki it's the

3215.349 --> 3220.9300000000003
worst it's completely superfluous

3218.19 --> 3223.839
totally unnecessary and it's the worst

3220.93 --> 3227.23
it gives a range of possibilities that

3223.839 --> 3229.81
should not be had that should not be

3227.23 --> 3233.41
given to corporations or any controlling

3229.81 --> 3236.0789999999997
factions ever not for the option that

3233.41 --> 3239.47
option should not be there these options

3236.079 --> 3240.88
should not be there 5y it's just the

3239.47 --> 3246.52
worst ever it should never be

3240.88 --> 3253.26
implemented ever and we don't freaking

3246.52 --> 3256.589
need it how obvious ly do we not need it

3253.26 --> 3256.5890000000004
whenever G

3289.94 --> 3296.4500000000003
right yeah that's the whole thing it

3293.47 --> 3301.24
they're just using it as sensory devices

3296.45 --> 3306.2
they're using high-level resonance

3301.24 --> 3310.2099999999996
technology abusing it mostly just for

3306.2 --> 3316.7799999999997
freaking spying manop you layin and

3310.21 --> 3324.339
mind-control and it's evil should not be

3316.78 --> 3324.3390000000004
there as part of society ever

3340.64 --> 3345.8799999999997
right

3342.94 --> 3349.03
I'm yeah I know I know everything could

3345.88 --> 3352.78
die okay everything it could be seeing

3349.03 --> 3355.4500000000003
like they fully implement that [ __ ] a

3352.78 --> 3358.02
quarter of like everyone you know could

3355.45 --> 3364.5299999999997
just be dead in five years

3358.02 --> 3366.369
okay Lea let alone creatures and plants

3364.53 --> 3369.2200000000003
maybe all of it

3366.369 --> 3375.9700000000003
so yeah it's the thing we should never

3369.22 --> 3381.7599999999998
ever have ever and yeah I'm not letting

3375.97 --> 3382.8999999999996
it happen I will I will get very serious

3381.76 --> 3389.13
about that [ __ ]

3382.9 --> 3389.13
I don't want it we don't need it

3395.48 --> 3405.23
just put freaking landlines everywhere

3398.69 --> 3407.15
just everywhere just flexible and you

3405.23 --> 3409.9
know there's so many possibilities with

3407.15 --> 3417.77
landlines even that are incredible

3409.9 --> 3420.83
incredibly efficient and all this

3417.77 --> 3425.24
wireless [ __ ] is useless it's damaging

3420.83 --> 3427.96
it's dangerous it's unnecessary should

3425.24 --> 3427.9599999999996
get rid of it

3436.89 --> 3446.0989999999997
you know like I get radio radio graphic

3442.859 --> 3447.569
controls for drones or whatever yeah

3446.099 --> 3450.329
does you're not gonna put a wire in

3447.569 --> 3451.049
between that so okay for such a thing I

3450.329 --> 3452.94
get it

3451.049 --> 3455.309
maybe you could use it for that

3452.94 --> 3460.049
specifically what as general

3455.309 --> 3466.849
communication it's just the worst don't

3460.049 --> 3470.489
you don't need it can keep the the

3466.849 --> 3475.6800000000003
radiographic communication lines keep it

3470.489 --> 3480.18
basic keep it simple and just don't use

3475.68 --> 3482.339
mobile devices to to download huge

3480.18 --> 3486.8689999999997
quantities of data that's not what it

3482.339 --> 3489.299
was meant for but basic communications

3486.869 --> 3492.3900000000003
aren't not meant to do that [ __ ] you're

3489.299 --> 3496.109
supposed to do that edit at the home

3492.39 --> 3499.3689999999997
station plugged into a line which is

3496.109 --> 3504.48
much more efficient not damaging cheaper

3499.369 --> 3506.7200000000003
so it's all look serious problems why we

3504.48 --> 3510.029
supposedly need all this heavy

3506.72 --> 3512.069
radiographic Internet well this Wi-Fi

3510.029 --> 3518.72
[ __ ] you don't need it nobody needs it

3512.069 --> 3518.72
nobody needs it nobody will need it

3538.849 --> 3541.719
yeah no [ __ ]

3548.16 --> 3555.42
[Music]

3551.06 --> 3561.21
the fiber-optic shield that's right

3555.42 --> 3563.13
fiber optics baby what's better than

3561.21 --> 3567.2400000000002
optics and fibers

3563.13 --> 3569.4900000000002
you know fiber optics is the future it

3567.24 --> 3572.359
always was it was what created the

3569.49 --> 3575.359
Internet not some freaking wireless [ __ ]

3572.359 --> 3575.359
okay

3585.02 --> 3592.9
yeah there is something wrong faster

3588.11 --> 3596.17
download speed too many options for

3592.9 --> 3600.2000000000003
doing dangerous stuff with it in general

3596.17 --> 3607.28
utilities yeah there is a lot wrong with

3600.2 --> 3611.72
5g and with Wi-Fi as well capacity for

3607.28 --> 3614.63
these devices should be limited there

3611.72 --> 3616.52
should not be all these this range of

3614.63 --> 3620.78
possibilities that could technically be

3616.52 --> 3624.2
done with them by outsiders these

3620.78 --> 3627.28
options should not be there and people

3624.2 --> 3630.8599999999997
should just get the [ __ ] away from

3627.28 --> 3633.8300000000004
mobile downloading [ __ ] it's useless you

3630.86 --> 3636.88
don't need it if you want to download

3633.83 --> 3641.119
something really important or whatever

3636.88 --> 3644.84
plug it in you know if it were up to me

3641.119 --> 3647.7400000000002
I'd say yeah all these Mobile's they

3644.84 --> 3650.869
should have freaking Internet plugs

3647.74 --> 3652.97
maybe you could even mandate it like

3650.869 --> 3656.4100000000003
yeah you must be able to plug it into

3652.97 --> 3659.81
regular Internet and then you just don't

3656.41 --> 3662.18
download through Wireless you just plug

3659.81 --> 3668.359
it in it's going to download like ten

3662.18 --> 3672.6189999999997
times as fast as fast at least yeah you

3668.359 --> 3675.5499999999997
don't need heavy wireless internet you

3672.619 --> 3675.55
don't need it ever

3681.079 --> 3685.28
what are you talking about Nathan

3693.359 --> 3701.859
this look 5,000,000 G okay they're gonna

3699.549 --> 3703.959
keep on amping it up forever until

3701.859 --> 3705.88
basically everybody's dead and they're

3703.959 --> 3709.0589999999997
gonna keep on doing it like a bunch of

3705.88 --> 3711.309
freakin Psychopaths and yeah they're not

3709.059 --> 3714.429
gonna stop until you say enough is

3711.309 --> 3721.2290000000003
enough and that means you're not gonna

3714.429 --> 3721.2290000000003
do it and they will keep on going

3729.49 --> 3734.39
now thank you a cynical skeptic for the

3732.29 --> 3737.11
five-dollar super chat donation much

3734.39 --> 3737.1099999999997
appreciated

3751.91 --> 3757.67
all right yeah if anything the

3754.43 --> 3760.49
difference between 50 and 6 g is that 5g

3757.67 --> 3765.319
can kill everyone slowly and 60 can

3760.49 --> 3767.89
probably kill people instantly that's

3765.319 --> 3767.89
the difference

3780.68 --> 3789.44
that's ridiculous Steve wireless

3785.009 --> 3792.539
internet is not awareness it's not an AI

3789.44 --> 3794.9700000000003
it's all about the levers of control of

3792.539 --> 3798.17
what is done with these technologies or

3794.97 --> 3798.1699999999996
what could be done with them

3806.54 --> 3809.59
[Music]

3821.95 --> 3826.29
okay enough Nathan it's not funny

3843.01 --> 3850.42
I need to get some lunch anyway yeah my

3848.29 --> 3854.71
Mike here seems to be working totally

3850.42 --> 3856.48
fine I've got it set at a hundred

3854.71 --> 3858.61
percent volume again it still would be

3856.48 --> 3865.08
good to test it next to somebody else

3858.61 --> 3869.53
coming on my panel right people in chat

3865.08 --> 3872.08
you could come over on my panel and see

3869.53 --> 3876.7000000000003
if Google hangout still works enough

3872.08 --> 3879.91
that you could be heard heard and then I

3876.7 --> 3882.0699999999997
can compare how my mic sounds and the

3879.91 --> 3885.31
volume of it compared to the panel

3882.07 --> 3887.52
members so that would be very nice if

3885.31 --> 3892.14
somebody could come on my panel for once

3887.52 --> 3892.14
instead of just sticking around in chat

3914.86 --> 3917.4
it

3964.68 --> 3972.019
Oh God

3967.16 --> 3974.3799999999997
clouds behind the Sun and Mary that's so

3972.019 --> 3974.3799999999997
silly

3979.33 --> 3987.13
all right look guys I'm pretty damn sure

3981.97 --> 3991.0
the Sun is a pure apparition a visual

3987.13 --> 3993.13
side effect as like a rainbow that is

3991.0 --> 3995.26
just seen at the epicenter of the

3993.13 --> 3999.27
daylight direction in relation to your

3995.26 --> 3999.2700000000004
position on the earth and that is all

3999.36 --> 4005.55
it's not a thing it's just that's where

4003.54 --> 4008.99
the light comes from in relation to your

4005.55 --> 4014.3100000000004
position and you see the Sun disk and

4008.99 --> 4019.43
it's not literally there so whether you

4014.31 --> 4021.84
could see clouds behind it or it

4019.43 --> 4024.48
disappearing into the horizon

4021.84 --> 4027.27
it's just apparently there it's it's an

4024.48 --> 4029.79
optical phenomena and yeah if you put an

4027.27 --> 4032.25
optical phenomenon next to something in

4029.79 --> 4034.77
the super far distance then that optical

4032.25 --> 4037.56
phenomena becomes very suggestively

4034.77 --> 4039.93
large because of perspective making

4037.56 --> 4044.04
things in the distance so small in

4039.93 --> 4046.2599999999998
contrast to that apparent Sun disk so it

4044.04 --> 4052.47
gives a suggestion of largeness but it's

4046.26 --> 4058.7700000000004
not any size it's an apparition it's a

4052.47 --> 4061.08
pure optical phenomena that's just how I

4058.77 --> 4064.56
see it and haven't seen anything that

4061.08 --> 4072.3199999999997
contradicts that so far nothing so these

4064.56 --> 4077.91
wild ideas about the Sun as a object is

4072.32 --> 4079.52
being naturally maintained and kept into

4077.91 --> 4082.2
its cycle through electromagnetic

4079.52 --> 4087.15
workings in the high atmosphere and

4082.2 --> 4090.5699999999997
hyper hyper speculation but I just don't

4087.15 --> 4094.05
see anything that really confirms that

4090.57 --> 4097.2300000000005
and it's always presupposition of some

4094.05 --> 4100.049
kind of specific realm setup that is

4097.23 --> 4104.619
required in this to work so I think it's

4100.049 --> 4109.2699999999995
an aberration that's what I think

4104.619 --> 4115.8099999999995
I think that yeah physicality assumption

4109.27 --> 4118.6900000000005
bias combination with yeah the knee with

4115.81 --> 4121.719
the acceptable need the generally

4118.69 --> 4124.96
acceptable need to have a model just

4121.719 --> 4127.96
creates this aberration that supposedly

4124.96 --> 4131.859
turns the son into a physical object in

4127.96 --> 4134.589
a physical location but yeah you don't

4131.859 --> 4137.349
know the total confine of the realm or

4134.589 --> 4140.29
the the spatial layout of it even really

4137.349 --> 4142.929
and you have no confirmation that the

4140.29 --> 4146.98
son is in a physical literal location in

4142.929 --> 4152.139
any way it seems very much holographic

4146.98 --> 4157.2699999999995
in nature bends in relation to how you

4152.139 --> 4159.52
move and so yeah it is always in a

4157.27 --> 4163.27
position in relation to your position

4159.52 --> 4164.400000000001
and so yeah you got the angular

4163.27 --> 4168.179
relations

4164.4 --> 4171.42
you got the apparent observation and

4168.179 --> 4171.42
that's it

4174.09 --> 4177.939
[Music]

4183.52 --> 4195.219
what are you talking about Rory pour

4191.049 --> 4197.67
anything doing quite well actually at

4195.219 --> 4197.67
the moment

4211.27 --> 4217.120000000001
reflection light right

4222.809 --> 4225.559
right

4226.23 --> 4232.11
it's not good evidence that we are

4228.51 --> 4234.09
seeing an illusion at all because there

4232.11 --> 4236.82
is a light coming from there okay you

4234.09 --> 4241.35
will get blinded if you look at it too

4236.82 --> 4245.79
long or what I don't know that all

4241.35 --> 4250.740000000001
depends on what you think about that but

4245.79 --> 4255.66
I think the Sun disc itself is an

4250.74 --> 4261.41
optical phenomena so I think that

4255.66 --> 4265.139999999999
sunlight or daylight is real it just

4261.41 --> 4268.68
manifested in some way that has nothing

4265.14 --> 4271.650000000001
to do with a specific origin point or an

4268.68 --> 4275.97
object that causes it I think it's

4271.65 --> 4281.509999999999
rather a electromagnetic side effect

4275.97 --> 4285.0
like a critical mass of some kind of

4281.51 --> 4291.33
energy maybe you could say like ley

4285.0 --> 4294.09
lines in the sky an electrical storm set

4291.33 --> 4298.59
up that has this daylight cycle as a

4294.09 --> 4301.68
side effect it it's the best I can think

4298.59 --> 4305.42
of but I don't think that the Sun is a

4301.68 --> 4305.42
physical object in any fashion

4311.57 --> 4316.429
and I think the moon is the same in that

4318.53 --> 4325.8
Thursday's really I'm in the dark on

4322.199 --> 4332.79
that one I'm not sure because I don't

4325.8 --> 4335.28
embrace the model really I think I'm

4332.79 --> 4338.13
pretty on target with this this is this

4335.28 --> 4342.33
is the real data this is what we really

4338.13 --> 4344.82
know what society has built upon knowing

4342.33 --> 4347.73
with certainty and constructed all their

4344.82 --> 4351.69
mathematical things it's all based on

4347.73 --> 4355.409
this specific data what they do know and

4351.69 --> 4360.15
then yeah constructs all over the place

4355.409 --> 4362.75
models concepts widely integrated in

4360.15 --> 4362.75
society

4370.079 --> 4376.98
no mercury seven sunburn doesn't prove

4374.34 --> 4382.099
the Sun to be a physical object at all

4376.98 --> 4385.949
it proves that daylight hitting you

4382.099 --> 4389.27
causes things that it's not the object

4385.949 --> 4392.449
of the Sun that you presume it's

4389.27 --> 4396.51
daylight hitting you that's what you got

4392.449 --> 4403.71
it's not radiation from the Sun there is

4396.51 --> 4406.5
no radiation no yeah like the magnetic

4403.71 --> 4409.349
field has a reach and it decreases over

4406.5 --> 4413.55
its reach okay there is no radiation

4409.349 --> 4416.79
reach from the Sun there's just the

4413.55 --> 4419.309
daylight and the daylight interaction

4416.79 --> 4423.409
with matter is what causes a lot of

4419.309 --> 4428.309
things read including heat buildup

4423.409 --> 4434.48
biological processes it's light hitting

4428.309 --> 4434.4800000000005
you it's not the Sun doing that

4445.31 --> 4449.09
okay that was funny

4457.29 --> 4461.18
it's ridiculous Jeffrey Bell

4468.15 --> 4478.0199999999995
look just because you can create light

4471.18 --> 4482.700000000001
locally and then use its yeah it's heat

4478.02 --> 4486.540000000001
rich to effect something doesn't mean

4482.7 --> 4490.08
that that is what the Sun is doing as a

4486.54 --> 4492.51
presumed object it's the light it's the

4490.08 --> 4496.2
light hitting that's what's doing it not

4492.51 --> 4498.900000000001
the distance to the Sun because there is

4496.2 --> 4501.51
no distance to the Sun there's no no

4498.9 --> 4506.99
proof of any physicality whatsoever the

4501.51 --> 4506.99
remains remains exactly what it is

4512.34 --> 4528.81
god you're nuts what the hell fighting

4520.69 --> 4528.8099999999995
Mindy is not fake okay it's ridiculous

4528.96 --> 4538.15
again daylight being absorbed by the

4533.23 --> 4541.69
skin has biological effects as does it

4538.15 --> 4547.48
also transform co2 and water into oxygen

4541.69 --> 4550.48
and glucose that's all real it has

4547.48 --> 4556.839999999999
nothing to do with the Sun as a presumed

4550.48 --> 4561.19
object has to do with daylight it's the

4556.84 --> 4563.88
daylight it's not an object there it's

4561.19 --> 4563.879999999999
the daylight

4568.129 --> 4573.979
right pigment as well there's all kinds

4570.709 --> 4577.159
of influences that daylight has not the

4573.979 --> 4580.6990000000005
Sun daylight and moonlight has effects

4577.159 --> 4586.959
as well by the way very opposing type of

4580.699 --> 4591.739
effects although I do wonder though I

4586.959 --> 4593.719
think I'm not sure don't have any direct

4591.739 --> 4596.688999999999
references or maybe I do and it just

4593.719 --> 4598.639
been it's been a while it wasn't dark

4596.689 --> 4601.969
world [ __ ] I don't know but I think that

4598.639 --> 4607.969
even like a solar farm a solar panel

4601.969 --> 4611.769
farm a big one could even produce some

4607.969 --> 4614.629
level of electricity from moon lights

4611.769 --> 4616.579000000001
it's not gonna be as much as the Sun of

4614.629 --> 4622.28
course not even nearly as much but I

4616.579 --> 4624.32
think it does actually generate some

4622.28 --> 4626.478999999999
kind of electricity maybe it's gonna be

4624.32 --> 4629.539
electricity of a different nature I

4626.479 --> 4632.419
don't know but moonlight is it sound

4629.539 --> 4634.999
it's like yeah the nightlight it's very

4632.419 --> 4637.639
weird to just call it Moon No

4634.999 --> 4640.969
yak we're all so used to calling it

4637.639 --> 4643.849
sunlight and moonlight always deriving

4640.969 --> 4648.05
from that presumed object that is

4643.849 --> 4649.669
actually an apparition but it's actually

4648.05 --> 4651.379
daylight and night light that's more

4649.669 --> 4654.8589999999995
correct although yeah with the moon it's

4651.379 --> 4658.489
not always at night so the how do you

4654.859 --> 4661.359
call it the different light the second

4658.489 --> 4661.3589999999995
light the cold like

4663.579 --> 4669.159
yeah I need to go on a break for a

4666.52 --> 4672.329000000001
moment I hope to be to see somebody in

4669.159 --> 4672.329
my panel after this

4770.88 --> 4774.93
you [ __ ] back

4781.34 --> 4785.56
[Music]

4792.37 --> 4795.899
[Music]

4796.41 --> 4802.8099999999995
yeah if I go out that way it's gonna be

4800.89 --> 4806.04
to get a smoke yeah to smoke something

4802.81 --> 4806.04
or whatever

4810.08 --> 4813.2789999999995
[Music]

4841.989 --> 4846.218999999999
guys are really not that funny

4855.98 --> 4860.959999999999
Wow Nathan that's amazing

4864.979 --> 4869.92
but that's a good one

4867.88 --> 4872.650000000001
yeah can you hear the crackling by the

4869.92 --> 4877.06
way of that I don't know how well you

4872.65 --> 4880.299999999999
can hear this I don't know

4877.06 --> 4883.150000000001
do you hear everything that I do now in

4880.3 --> 4885.79
detail I can't hide anything anymore I

4883.15 --> 4890.98
can multitask I have to moot mutes the

4885.79 --> 4896.49
mic I have no idea right so you can all

4890.98 --> 4901.599999999999
hear this [ __ ] right okay yeah I'm gonna

4896.49 --> 4904.0199999999995
roll a smoke hope somebody will join my

4901.6 --> 4904.02
panel

4915.58 --> 4925.43
right yeah it's not raised lights green

4919.46 --> 4937.07
go I really like this brand it's a very

4925.43 --> 4940.85
transparent thin paper that's not

4937.07 --> 4943.87
actually gonna be a joint with a good

4940.85 --> 4943.870000000001
carbon filter

4948.31 --> 4951.31
and

4964.449 --> 4968.739
oh yeah the over Mukul that vacuum

4966.85 --> 4973.570000000001
cleaner is not actually a vacuum cleaner

4968.739 --> 4985.57
what you heard but it's like a one of

4973.57 --> 4994.21
those wiles plant cutting devices I'll

4985.57 --> 4996.57
show you it's like my neighbor down

4994.21 --> 4996.57
there

5003.11 --> 5008.38
they make those wasp tags type sounds

5010.51 --> 5021.26
like a wood wasp cutting away in the

5014.27 --> 5025.84
wood very noisy very carrying for such a

5021.26 --> 5025.84
small device but oh well

5027.579 --> 5032.44
yes trimmer that's right miss trimmer

5048.469 --> 5056.199
[ __ ] use I think they actually do exist

5051.86 --> 5058.46
long like automated lawn mowers and

5056.199 --> 5062.089999999999
because I wouldn't be surprised if there

5058.46 --> 5066.14
are like fine programmable fine cut

5062.09 --> 5070.1900000000005
fine cutter long robots that can do it

5066.14 --> 5073.660000000001
in super detail probably going to be

5070.19 --> 5073.66
somewhat expensive though

5089.05 --> 5091.56
what

5096.4 --> 5103.5199999999995
all right

5099.21 --> 5103.52
pretty sure this is real Nathan

5110.46 --> 5113.09
what

5121.729 --> 5130.969
okay that's new well you did see our

5127.94 --> 5138.728999999999
wind before he had the Tash and then how

5130.969 --> 5138.729
I slowly grew it on so I don't know

5140.289 --> 5147.699
Nathan is trying to create controversy

5143.349 --> 5150.8
as a promotional stunt I get the idea

5147.699 --> 5153.799999999999
now I'm just so boring and

5150.8 --> 5155.959
straightforward and direct and sometimes

5153.8 --> 5157.639
extremely confusing and people just

5155.959 --> 5159.829
don't understand what the hell I'm

5157.639 --> 5167.32
talking about because I'm way outside of

5159.829 --> 5167.32
the regular oh god sure my CGI Tash

5170.84 --> 5180.02
yeah but you know that God why am I even

5174.92 --> 5184.12
doing this look as an elf it's very hard

5180.02 --> 5186.26
to grow anything so I'm seriously

5184.12 --> 5189.89
surprised that I can even have a

5186.26 --> 5192.89
mustache that it's like enough there

5189.89 --> 5196.46
that it can be visible to somebody on

5192.89 --> 5198.320000000001
camera or anything because ten years ago

5196.46 --> 5203.36
I didn't think that was a possibility

5198.32 --> 5211.37
really so I'm very happy with my

5203.36 --> 5213.62
mustache I like it I will never grow

5211.37 --> 5222.44
beard simply because I'm absolutely sure

5213.62 --> 5224.0
that's not possible and yeah I don't

5222.44 --> 5229.19
know if I'm gonna keep it forever

5224.0 --> 5232.31
I might need to remind myself how I look

5229.19 --> 5235.849999999999
compared to a long time ago because the

5232.31 --> 5239.330000000001
mustache does can change the way I feel

5235.85 --> 5243.29
to me and probably to other people as

5239.33 --> 5245.8
well just one little thing can make such

5243.29 --> 5245.8
a big difference

5259.159 --> 5264.54
all right well my side look I don't

5261.81 --> 5270.9800000000005
really do a lot of work on my sideburns

5264.54 --> 5274.26
it is what it is a tendency to get

5270.98 --> 5279.629999999999
asymmetrical so I do try this

5274.26 --> 5285.570000000001
keep the symmetry in there but other

5279.63 --> 5288.119
than that I'm pretty natural yeah I

5285.57 --> 5293.009999999999
don't think I could ever grow them to

5288.119 --> 5297.69
like proper Jew sized so I heard I don't

5293.01 --> 5301.530000000001
have it in there or maybe I just need to

5297.69 --> 5303.449
get older for that you know I do manage

5301.53 --> 5305.73
to get in the mustache now so who knows

5303.449 --> 5308.089999999999
maybe in 20 years I will be able to get

5305.73 --> 5311.178999999999
a beard wouldn't that be surprising I

5308.09 --> 5311.179
don't know

5314.579 --> 5321.079
it's weird that as I grow older I do

5318.09 --> 5324.2390000000005
notice there's just kind of subtle

5321.079 --> 5327.54
transformations oh god that sounds such

5324.239 --> 5330.419999999999
like such a teenage story but subtle

5327.54 --> 5332.79
transformations at a later age because I

5330.42 --> 5338.34
do remember my teens was a big change

5332.79 --> 5341.369
yeah but it feels like there is just

5338.34 --> 5343.92
more happening still I'm still changing

5341.369 --> 5350.2699999999995
in a way that's not necessarily like

5343.92 --> 5355.61
getting old but still just transforming

5350.27 --> 5355.610000000001
in certain way subtle ways I don't know

5356.51 --> 5365.1900000000005
anyways so yeah and nobody's gonna come

5363.239 --> 5369.959999999999
on my panel are they I'm really

5365.19 --> 5374.73
disappointed I really wanted to test out

5369.96 --> 5377.13
my mic with somebody new or with

5374.73 --> 5380.209999999999
somebody on the panel see how the sound

5377.13 --> 5380.21
is in comparison

5401.8 --> 5405.39
Nathan you're crazy

5424.369 --> 5432.98
okay I got the impression Nathan is in

5427.31 --> 5435.369000000001
the Faye mood I don't know what he's

5432.98 --> 5435.369
doing

5436.27 --> 5443.679
maybe the free time is getting to him

5439.78 --> 5443.679
just as too much energy

5471.11 --> 5480.469999999999
yeah seems to be having fun I'm okay

5473.21 --> 5483.52
just don't get to prefer to please can't

5480.47 --> 5483.52
say I appreciate that

5494.16 --> 5503.66
Oh Oh you're having a a man's home alone

5501.33 --> 5519.21
party are you Nathan

5503.66 --> 5521.49
damn the mancave party yeah I'm gonna

5519.21 --> 5524.3
put on something cuz I'm it's getting

5521.49 --> 5524.3
too cold for me

5561.01 --> 5566.650000000001
can you hear that the bird chirping my

5564.41 --> 5566.65
way

5577.59 --> 5583.1900000000005
I'll put the gain on a little bit more

5579.929 --> 5583.1900000000005
to see if you can hear it

5595.46 --> 5603.06
[Music]

5618.84 --> 5622.05
[Music]

5624.52 --> 5640.030000000001
that's typical birth bumbaclot gator

5636.11 --> 5640.03
fish has 30 birds in his house

5656.44 --> 5664.36
so yeah I'm I'm gonna have a smoke and

5659.67 --> 5669.04
yeah I hope to maybe find somebody in my

5664.36 --> 5673.03
panel I'll hang around and I'll keep on

5669.04 --> 5674.8
going in for at least a half an hour or

5673.03 --> 5675.46
so and then we'll just see where this

5674.8 --> 5678.6
goes

5675.46 --> 5678.6
just take it easy

5777.689 --> 5789.360000000001
all right well tinfoil Hector mr. caps

5782.909 --> 5792.9
troll right yeah I am up for debate okay

5789.36 --> 5796.978999999999
but it's really annoying to be here

5792.9 --> 5798.659
talking all the time and just responding

5796.979 --> 5802.26
to chat that's not a real good way to

5798.659 --> 5804.449
debate I can't do it up to a certain

5802.26 --> 5806.34
point but yeah if I get heavy then

5804.449 --> 5808.558999999999
everybody starts stepping in and becomes

5806.34 --> 5809.6990000000005
harder to actually follow what is said

5808.559 --> 5812.13
and to keep it going

5809.699 --> 5815.579
so it's it's just much better if

5812.13 --> 5818.849
somebody actually joins so it can have a

5815.579 --> 5821.489
more structure iced conversation that's

5818.849 --> 5826.829
why I keep asking can somebody please

5821.489 --> 5831.468999999999
get on my panel and people so rarely do

5826.829 --> 5831.469
I don't know why

5839.809 --> 5845.84
or maybe it is because as soon as say

5842.15 --> 5846.92
they do I start over talking them that's

5845.84 --> 5850.099
probably why

5846.92 --> 5852.25
but yeah we can work on it I can work on

5850.099 --> 5852.25
it

6016.08 --> 6029.15
yeah I hope I heard somebody on the

6021.6 --> 6029.150000000001
panel yeah dude Martin

6064.77 --> 6073.580000000001
oh yeah by the way I almost forgot I

6068.7 --> 6073.58
forgot yesterday but did everybody see

6075.26 --> 6086.570000000001
did everybody see Horace Horace come

6082.71 --> 6090.17
back because apparently hat rage quit it

6086.57 --> 6094.98
for a moment because people discovered

6090.17 --> 6097.71
his advertisement thingies that he did

6094.98 --> 6102.299999999999
and yeah he owned it I thought it was

6097.71 --> 6107.28
pretty impressive he made a pretty funny

6102.3 --> 6110.78
skit with it was really cool yeah and he

6107.28 --> 6110.78
shouted you out ace McCloud

6120.38 --> 6136.16
but yeah glad to see that he's back and

6131.33 --> 6138.08
yeah you know I I'm not necessarily

6136.16 --> 6142.7
taking credit for it but I did tell him

6138.08 --> 6145.97
like yeah you you know you don't have to

6142.7 --> 6149.2699999999995
be ashamed Wow look in a way yeah kind

6145.97 --> 6152.72
of but he chose to be a professional he

6149.27 --> 6157.700000000001
chose to go full in on the acting range

6152.72 --> 6161.33
and that that it's like ambitious in a

6157.7 --> 6161.929999999999
very risky way and yeah if you're gonna

6161.33 --> 6163.82
do it

6161.93 --> 6165.47
then you better be proud of it otherwise

6163.82 --> 6168.59
you're gonna create something that's

6165.47 --> 6171.2
gonna haunt you and I told him that and

6168.59 --> 6173.33
the next day he did that video and I'm

6171.2 --> 6176.599999999999
just yeah kind of proud of him like yeah

6173.33 --> 6181.1
that's exactly what I would have chosen

6176.6 --> 6188.3
if I was in his shoes and he did it very

6181.1 --> 6189.89
gracefully very funny how old was that

6188.3 --> 6192.16
commercial I think it's a couple of

6189.89 --> 6195.530000000001
years old

6192.16 --> 6202.91
look hores been added in advertisement

6195.53 --> 6208.099999999999
for for quite a while like way before

6202.91 --> 6211.04
flat earth even so yeah he's been at it

6208.1 --> 6213.71
for a long time and he did almost

6211.04 --> 6216.43
everything anything you can imagine

6213.71 --> 6216.43
almost

6219.679 --> 6230.86
and he made a living off it so yeah

6222.469 --> 6230.86

6277.18 --> 6282.1900000000005
understanding of the scientific method

6279.7 --> 6289.8099999999995

I'd love to have him back

both agreed yeah we were both in a

6390.92 --> 6396.7300000000005
shitty mood and it just didn't work out

6435.26 --> 6445.159000000001
loyal very enthusiastic great guy with

6440.87 --> 6448.849999999999
some crazy and exciting stories yeah

6445.159 --> 6450.469
we talk a lot in the background it's

6448.85 --> 6453.9490000000005
very passionate about a lot of things

6450.469 --> 6456.83
that I too am passionate about he's

6453.949 --> 6459.169999999999
still younger and very spirited at it I

6456.83 --> 6461.389
just feel a little older take a little

6459.17 --> 6466.0
bit more easy so it's good to talk to

6461.389 --> 6469.28
him and shout out today in a George F

6466.0 --> 6473.719
pretty recently on the scene but he made

6469.28 --> 6477.05
quite an impact and yeah that guy is

6473.719 --> 6479.87
always hyperactive in the mind and does

6477.05 --> 6484.159000000001
have some tendencies to to draw quick

6479.87 --> 6487.73
conclusions but yeah it man he brings

6484.159 --> 6493.3099999999995
out some great concepts and really made

6487.73 --> 6497.33
me push me made me push myself to the to

6493.31 --> 6499.219
the limits of my visualisation capacity

6497.33 --> 6503.15
to understand the connections of all

6499.219 --> 6506.389
things and yeah he made me think a lot

6503.15 --> 6509.21
and he didn't help me understand the

6506.389 --> 6511.82
nature of this the similar Tory nature

6509.21 --> 6513.7390000000005
of this world a lot better that concept

6511.82 --> 6517.3099999999995
that I've been saying for a long time

6513.739 --> 6518.8099999999995
he gave it more content or backdrop as

6517.31 --> 6521.42
to where that's actually coming from

6518.81 --> 6524.110000000001
because I always felt it was like that

6521.42 --> 6526.4890000000005
due to my dark world experiences and

6524.11 --> 6528.38
holographic globe of the heavens and all

6526.489 --> 6530.509999999999
kinds of things the looping concept

6528.38 --> 6538.659000000001
would make it similar Tory and yeah he

6530.51 --> 6538.659000000001
found some compelling deductive elements

6539.34 --> 6546.45
in in his reasoning that support that so

6543.55 --> 6550.360000000001
it's been very good to have him among us

6546.45 --> 6553.74
great guy and of course shout out the

6550.36 --> 6557.83
chocolate saying the most awesome

6553.74 --> 6560.55
panelists on the flatter scene it was

6557.83 --> 6560.55
good to have him

6577.699 --> 6584.48
yeah yep it did that for a distance for

6580.58 --> 6585.17
this time so yeah that was some

6584.48 --> 6587.9
shoutouts

6585.17 --> 6597.4400000000005
oh yeah shout out to Martin Latika of

6587.9 --> 6601.94
course also for providing the juice and

6597.44 --> 6606.62
I always like to figure out what he's

6601.94 --> 6610.549999999999
trying to present and and see if I can

6606.62 --> 6614.0
find some weird crazy thing that he made

6610.55 --> 6615.469
up about certain things to make it a

6614.0 --> 6619.61
little bit more interesting he does that

6615.469 --> 6621.62
sometimes but it's it's minor I don't

6619.61 --> 6624.739
know it did I still liked it a lot I

6621.62 --> 6629.09
don't feel he's like trying to really

6624.739 --> 6630.799999999999
mislead or anything he's just trying to

6629.09 --> 6633.400000000001
make sense of it all and it's so much

6630.8 --> 6635.75
yeah you have to present it in some way

6633.4 --> 6637.699
that is kind of understandable and

6635.75 --> 6640.25
consistent and that's just very

6637.699 --> 6645.949
difficult because so much has happened

6640.25 --> 6649.28
in the past with and not all of it is

6645.949 --> 6652.46
that directly correlating but that makes

6649.28 --> 6655.849999999999
it harder to to follow to keep track of

6652.46 --> 6658.82
so I get the feeling he sometimes lays

6655.85 --> 6662.2390000000005
connections persistently that are not

6658.82 --> 6665.989
necessarily there it could be seen as

6662.239 --> 6669.428999999999
such but may not be too irrelevant in

6665.989 --> 6672.949
the bigger picture but that's just his

6669.429 --> 6674.96
you know you probably finds it really

6672.949 --> 6680.0599999999995
annoying that I do this and I'm sorry

6674.96 --> 6682.37
for it Martin but I do I do love your

6680.06 --> 6684.530000000001
presentations I'm out I always tried to

6682.37 --> 6688.5199999999995
be their life especially the live ones

6684.53 --> 6690.949
it's awesome because he does read what

6688.52 --> 6692.63
people say in chat and reflects a lot

6690.949 --> 6696.139999999999
and I just I don't know I find him a

6692.63 --> 6698.75
really likable guy and he has some

6696.14 --> 6702.56
serious juice he has amazing pictures

6698.75 --> 6704.86
always so yeah shout out to Martin

6702.56 --> 6704.860000000001
Lathika

6738.989 --> 6745.07
why people are always whining about

6741.0 --> 6753.27
being banned it's so annoying and

6745.07 --> 6757.59
useless you're trying to enter the

6753.27 --> 6760.400000000001
attention as a victim it's so so stupid

6757.59 --> 6760.400000000001
it slow

6768.07 --> 6775.509999999999
now Martin Harris and that's that's not

6770.77 --> 6779.92
the only way it's actually quite the

6775.51 --> 6782.67
other way around but that's what you do

6779.92 --> 6782.67
isn't it

6792.739 --> 6800.69
oh you know if you want to debate my

6797.51 --> 6803.6900000000005
Flat Earth is so stupid you can always

6800.69 --> 6804.83
add me on skype and get on my panel I'm

6803.69 --> 6809.089999999999
up for Globus

6804.83 --> 6814.84
no problem with that but don't go

6809.09 --> 6814.84
spamming your iteration nonsense please

6826.62 --> 6848.09
[Music]

6833.68 --> 6850.64
No yeah Martin Harrison I'm asking you

6848.09 --> 6852.860000000001
to add me on skype and then come on my

6850.64 --> 6855.740000000001
panel and actually talk about it instead

6852.86 --> 6861.3099999999995
of being a keyboard warrior spouting

6855.74 --> 6861.3099999999995
your reverse world rhetoric [ __ ]

6884.19 --> 6890.25
all right why don't you try me Martin

6886.56 --> 6892.409000000001
Harrison see if my weird pseudo

6890.25 --> 6897.389
arguments will collapse on the your

6892.409 --> 6900.199
scrutiny or maybe I'll feed that

6897.389 --> 6903.3
scrutiny right back at you and show you

6900.199 --> 6906.69
where the entire angle of your approach

6903.3 --> 6909.84
is wrong and how your you're actually

6906.69 --> 6915.9
the one ignoring almost everything in

6909.84 --> 6918.06
reality to just reference those pieces

6915.9 --> 6921.449
of the painting to make the image

6918.06 --> 6924.51
seemingly work because in reality it

6921.449 --> 6930.57
doesn't really the globe model is

6924.51 --> 6932.88
riddled with holes everywhere it's just

6930.57 --> 6935.57
a painting it's make-believe doesn't

6932.88 --> 6935.57
actually work

6938.84 --> 6942.78
it's not just singing it's like in all

6941.24 --> 6945.969999999999
the layers

6942.78 --> 6945.969999999999
[Music]

6963.06 --> 6972.7300000000005
mm-hmm the funny thing is you don't even

6969.01 --> 6979.84
know what the Sun is you assume it's

6972.73 --> 6982.209999999999
some object some lamp out there that is

6979.84 --> 6988.51
sending us the sunlight but that's not

6982.21 --> 6991.6
what it is it doesn't work out you can't

6988.51 --> 6996.22
go there I'd like to see somebody try

6991.6 --> 6999.700000000001
actually go towards the Sun see what

6996.22 --> 7002.64
happens I'll I'll I'll guarantee you as

6999.7 --> 7004.349999999999
soon as you do that the yeah you can go

7002.64 --> 7008.12
in a straight line towards it and

7004.35 --> 7012.21
eventually if you keep exactly stable

7008.12 --> 7015.39
take a gyroscope there and keep the the

7012.21 --> 7019.7300000000005
angle exact you've probably gonna see

7015.39 --> 7023.31
the Sun subtly oh yeah more rapidly

7019.73 --> 7025.74
evading so you actually have to change

7023.31 --> 7028.71
angle every time to keep going towards

7025.74 --> 7032.55
the Sun and you'll end up probably going

7028.71 --> 7035.24
sideways because she can't go there it's

7032.55 --> 7037.74
not a physical object at any point

7035.24 --> 7040.94
it's an apparition like a rainbow it

7037.74 --> 7044.67
deflects as you move even towards it

7040.94 --> 7047.219999999999
that's what I think will happen and I

7044.67 --> 7050.15
haven't seen anything that contradicts

7047.22 --> 7050.150000000001
that so far

7085.289 --> 7096.259999999999
how do you measure acceleration don't

7092.73 --> 7096.259999999999
you mean the juice

7102.73 --> 7107.089999999999
yeah I'm Martin Harrison it's just a

7105.199 --> 7109.3099999999995
global Joel he's not planning to do

7107.09 --> 7114.77
anything but be a keyboard warrior and

7109.31 --> 7117.679
just do the typical thing so I'll stop

7114.77 --> 7119.4800000000005
paying attention to that I think I'm

7117.679 --> 7124.34
gonna round out the show I've been going

7119.48 --> 7125.959999999999
for yet to two hours now so yeah would

7124.34 --> 7128.63
have been nice to have an actual debate

7125.96 --> 7134.65
face-to-face maybe with a globe and fine

7128.63 --> 7134.650000000001
with me you know what what what is that

7139.91 --> 7146.92
is that a YouTube video let me check

7144.56 --> 7146.92
