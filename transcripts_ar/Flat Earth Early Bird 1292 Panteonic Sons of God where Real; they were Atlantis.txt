178.18 --> 181.52
[Music]

181.599 --> 185.83999999999997
yeah 21 degrees celsius so

190.8 --> 197.12
yeah so yeah if you get wet in this

193.599 --> 200.39999999999998
you get in a dry place and you dry up

197.12 --> 203.76
pretty quickly so it's not even that

200.4 --> 203.76000000000002
gross type of weather

208.72 --> 212.599
what are they doing

218.959 --> 221.959
what

227.68 --> 231.20000000000002
sorry i'm getting distracted

232.319 --> 237.04
it's like this couple

234.4 --> 240.159
with their bikes hiding under the trees

237.04 --> 243.67999999999998
but they're like filming something

240.159 --> 243.67999999999998
i think i don't get it

247.76 --> 253.28
oh wait it could just be the woman just

250.799 --> 255.36
staring at him oh well

253.28 --> 257.6
whatever

255.36 --> 258.79900000000004
distracted distracted it just looked

257.6 --> 261.35900000000004
weird

258.799 --> 261.359
but uh

261.519 --> 269.84000000000003
hey mike's doing it good to see you

264.479 --> 269.84
it is sunday the 3rd of july 2022

274.08 --> 280.96
and i've been kind of weird like drowsy

278.16 --> 285.12
it started yesterday

280.96 --> 287.84
afternoon really already with the like

285.12 --> 290.56
before the uh ball buster started and i

287.84 --> 292.4
was just like so freaking tired and i've

290.56 --> 295.72
been like that throughout the

292.4 --> 295.71999999999997
the evening

296.24 --> 300.72
slept a full night

298.479 --> 301.59999999999997
and then this morning again i just feel

300.72 --> 304.0
like

301.6 --> 307.6
i just feel like sleeping i just i'm

304.0 --> 310.32
rested but it feels like sleeping

307.6 --> 313.199
but then if you go lay down it it

310.32 --> 316.479
doesn't work it's very annoying really

313.199 --> 316.479
so kind of drowsy

316.56 --> 321.32
a little left sides perspective

326.56 --> 329.28000000000003
good to see you

329.36 --> 335.16
all right so i tried to kind of wake

331.6 --> 335.16
myself up

335.17 --> 338.22
[Music]

341.67 --> 346.88
[Music]

344.4 --> 348.71999999999997
right so i i really was barely present

346.88 --> 350.08
at the ball busters yesterday i'm sorry

348.72 --> 352.24
for that

350.08 --> 356.08
i to be fair i was actually sleeping

352.24 --> 356.08
part part of it it's just

357.36 --> 360.319
too drowsy

363.68 --> 369.199
it's so odd like in a way to me it's

366.0 --> 371.6
kind of unpredictable

369.199 --> 374.08000000000004
like one moment it's super hot but then

371.6 --> 376.319
i'm like restless i get like a lot of

374.08 --> 378.4
energy or to get bit broody

376.319 --> 380.88
and then another moment

378.4 --> 384.08
later on in the month

380.88 --> 387.28
it's just like hot weather the same

384.08 --> 389.35999999999996
and then i get super just drowsy and

387.28 --> 392.84
like uh

389.36 --> 392.84000000000003
it's so weird

395.36 --> 400.47900000000004
but then again maybe it's just directly

397.919 --> 402.4
rolling out of the amount of energy and

400.479 --> 405.36
focus that i've been putting in my shows

402.4 --> 407.28
because like the the recent few shows

405.36 --> 409.599
have all been

407.28 --> 412.479
very high

409.599 --> 414.4
fractal inside spirit mechanics

412.479 --> 416.15999999999997
like very high

414.4 --> 419.919
and it's continuing but it's kind of

416.16 --> 423.28000000000003
drainy kind of draining

419.919 --> 426.88
because in those moments it it all works

423.28 --> 429.84
but then as soon as i stop looking

426.88 --> 429.84
i notice that just

432.4 --> 436.479
not because of rage but because of the

434.479 --> 440.4
just

436.479 --> 444.479
using all that energy on that level

440.4 --> 444.479
hey flatter sage tomonoid

444.56 --> 447.919
needs some trolls to fight

446.88 --> 450.4
no

447.919 --> 454.0
no not really

450.4 --> 454.0
and they are probably hungover

454.8 --> 457.28000000000003
but uh

461.199 --> 465.52000000000004
i've been thinking more

463.199 --> 468.319
it's always dangerous

465.52 --> 470.56
another ways but sometimes

468.319 --> 470.56
just

471.12 --> 476.96
i re-watch bloody zeus again

473.919 --> 478.56
to just look at

476.96 --> 480.71999999999997
like

478.56 --> 483.039
story-wise what is happening where did

480.72 --> 485.91900000000004
it come from and unfortunate like

483.039 --> 485.919
unfortunately

486.4 --> 490.87899999999996
the details of the mythology are

488.479 --> 493.75899999999996
basically handed through the story by

490.879 --> 495.91900000000004
people so it's not like you're literally

493.759 --> 498.24
getting the entire picture

495.919 --> 500.71999999999997
just through this through that

498.24 --> 500.72
series

502.08 --> 506.56
she's been thinking a lot then i also

504.24 --> 509.199
watched the video from eric the bay this

506.56 --> 509.199
morning even

510.8 --> 515.039
that was

512.32 --> 517.599
like playing into like this suspicion

515.039 --> 519.1999999999999
that i had even as a kid

517.599 --> 521.519
when i first got confronted with

519.2 --> 523.519
mythology like when i did

521.519 --> 526.399
i got a very

523.519 --> 528.88
odd response compared to most namely

526.399 --> 531.519
this is freaking real

528.88 --> 533.12
like this is real

531.519 --> 535.12
like it feels real

533.12 --> 538.16
that that's the response that i had like

535.12 --> 540.399
i just like believed in greek mythology

538.16 --> 542.959
and was just like this

540.399 --> 545.92
this was real

542.959 --> 548.7199999999999
but how right i never knew how

545.92 --> 551.279
oh i learned so much since then since a

548.72 --> 551.279
young kid

551.44 --> 556.8800000000001
just about what is in the world

554.16 --> 559.76
in history

556.88 --> 561.04
what people have done with it

559.76 --> 564.8
and

561.04 --> 564.8
i think that maybe like

565.2 --> 571.519
it might be almost as simple

568.08 --> 573.6
as saying that at like atlantis the

571.519 --> 574.5600000000001
great city

573.6 --> 577.76
was

574.56 --> 580.16
like mount olympus and the gods

577.76 --> 582.56
which would be little g gods

580.16 --> 585.519
lived there that the pantheon was

582.56 --> 587.68
actually just physically there

585.519 --> 590.399
and that all that happened basically

587.68 --> 594.4799999999999
applies to it and that they might have

590.399 --> 594.48
been those sons of god

596.24 --> 599.44
that were kind of like

599.6 --> 604.5600000000001
designated in a sense to care take over

602.16 --> 605.68
the world

604.56 --> 607.8389999999999
and then

605.68 --> 609.279
it all went wrong well

607.839 --> 611.12
just watching

609.279 --> 615.36
just thinking about standard greek

611.12 --> 615.36
mythology it's usually very tragic

615.68 --> 619.8389999999999
most of it that's even the way the story

617.68 --> 621.92
is set up to make it more memorable no

619.839 --> 623.839
but maybe

621.92 --> 626.399
there's something like really close to

623.839 --> 630.0790000000001
that that these little g gods

626.399 --> 630.079
that they did their best but that

630.72 --> 637.12
their powers basically just took

634.16 --> 638.8
them over and they became like because

637.12 --> 640.64
they involved with the earthly they

638.8 --> 643.519
became earthly and they started to

640.64 --> 647.12
attract earthly flaws which are like

643.519 --> 649.12
universally expressed within the concept

647.12 --> 652.16
of the pantheon like on a spiritual

649.12 --> 652.16
mechanical level it's

653.519 --> 657.2
the [ __ ] is starting to merge

657.76 --> 661.8389999999999
it's like holy [ __ ]

663.839 --> 668.0790000000001
i think the pantheon literally may have

666.16 --> 670.399
been the sons of god that were like

668.079 --> 675.04
assigned to caretake

670.399 --> 678.24
and then just everything went wrong

675.04 --> 679.8389999999999
they took on earthly traits

678.24 --> 682.9590000000001
and

679.839 --> 684.399
demons have arrived like even apparently

682.959 --> 687.1199999999999
it was their

684.399 --> 689.68
arrival that created that counterbalance

687.12 --> 691.519
force now here comes the weirdy the

689.68 --> 694.4799999999999
weird part

691.519 --> 697.76
i have a very specific

694.48 --> 699.279
graph or graph depiction on my symbolics

697.76 --> 702.48
dot nl site

699.279 --> 706.48
that basically expresses this entire

702.48 --> 706.48
pattern this entire thing

707.04 --> 709.4399999999999
it is

710.24 --> 714.48
within

711.279 --> 716.639
the theory section god's demons and life

714.48 --> 718.8000000000001
and it's just like if i

716.639 --> 721.279
just put that again

718.8 --> 724.399
it is almost like this realization i'm

721.279 --> 727.6
having now it's a rediscovery

724.399 --> 730.399
i discovered this back then in 2006 i

727.6 --> 732.32
just did not have the information about

730.399 --> 735.519
the world to truly connect it but i

732.32 --> 738.32
already saw it i saw the pattern and i

735.519 --> 738.32
put it there

739.6 --> 744.8000000000001
i'm gonna present it for a second

742.56 --> 747.279
just because i can it's my freaking

744.8 --> 749.68
website i made that

747.279 --> 752.32
i actually paid for that

749.68 --> 752.3199999999999
at the time

756.48 --> 759.36
but

757.279 --> 762.8
i don't even have to show you the words

759.36 --> 762.8000000000001
i can just show you

764.399 --> 766.639
the

767.44 --> 770.24
the pictures

770.56 --> 774.88
the pictures alone are like

776.959 --> 781.3599999999999
well they should be already telling

779.04 --> 781.36
enough

781.6 --> 785.279
all right so there you go

783.839 --> 786.9590000000001
there it is

785.279 --> 789.76
it's a transition

786.959 --> 789.76
the earthly

792.48 --> 795.44
and

794.32 --> 798.0
the yeah

795.44 --> 799.6800000000001
outside the spirit realm

798.0 --> 802.079
the gods

799.68 --> 805.1999999999999
and how it basically started to mingle

802.079 --> 807.519
in god started to get in like zeus

805.2 --> 810.1600000000001
started to [ __ ] around with the material

807.519 --> 812.16
realm made them my gods

810.16 --> 814.639
and it attracted shadow you could say

812.16 --> 815.92
here i got jealous

814.639 --> 817.92
right

815.92 --> 820.959
and then just like

817.92 --> 825.24
it all becomes more pronounced and then

820.959 --> 825.2399999999999
demons start to get involved

829.6 --> 831.839
it's

833.04 --> 837.04
yeah maybe this is just me squirting

835.44 --> 838.72
internally i have no idea if you can

837.04 --> 841.12
even follow my train of thinking

838.72 --> 843.519
probably to some extent it's just that i

841.12 --> 847.68
am

843.519 --> 850.48
staggered by how i seem to work

847.68 --> 852.56
how i can attain these insights before i

850.48 --> 855.12
even understand what it is and then

852.56 --> 856.6389999999999
later it turns out

855.12 --> 859.68
that i was right

856.639 --> 862.0790000000001
and i don't even feel like that's me oh

859.68 --> 862.8
it's all because of me i was right no

862.079 --> 865.8389999999999
it's

862.8 --> 869.0
i am just astounded by what has happened

865.839 --> 869.0
to me

876.16 --> 878.7199999999999
anyhow

881.76 --> 888.56
hello a real

884.88 --> 888.56
no you're not the real guy

890.48 --> 894.12
get outta here

913.68 --> 917.519
wait i might have been a little bit too

915.68 --> 921.4399999999999
rash there

917.519 --> 921.44
but you yeah we'll see

922.959 --> 926.7199999999999
derpcon one

925.44 --> 929.1990000000001
uh

926.72 --> 932.6
low seeking star war

929.199 --> 932.5999999999999
gary wiebenga

946.56 --> 953.1199999999999
right anyhow that that is basically it

950.8 --> 956.8
i think i've merged the idea of greek

953.12 --> 956.8
mythology pantheon

957.12 --> 961.12
mount olympus

959.04 --> 965.36
with

961.12 --> 968.48
the idea of atlantis and how it sank and

965.36 --> 970.8000000000001
like even how it was done like they made

968.48 --> 973.1990000000001
like power and technology yeah they had

970.8 --> 975.4399999999999
that like even in the the greek

973.199 --> 978.16
mythology they had power of technology

975.44 --> 979.519
there was one god that was like

978.16 --> 982.56
an engineer

979.519 --> 985.12
and he just designed all this stuff

982.56 --> 989.1199999999999
on levels that we are just like

985.12 --> 993.04
boggled by it is it was

989.12 --> 994.839
more than just human development

993.04 --> 996.48
they had

994.839 --> 999.0400000000001
incredible

996.48 --> 1002.5600000000001
power assigned to them

999.04 --> 1002.56
and they were little gods

1008.399 --> 1012.0
and it's interesting to compare all of

1010.72 --> 1014.639
this

1012.0 --> 1017.759
then to the

1014.639 --> 1019.44
well the more modern christian christian

1017.759 --> 1021.839
approach of the idea

1019.44 --> 1023.6800000000001
which made the claim that they are like

1021.839 --> 1025.679
fallen angels

1023.68 --> 1029.4389999999999
that they're evil

1025.679 --> 1029.439
right that they're here to seduce us

1029.919 --> 1036.3190000000002
and that they potentially like the gods

1032.959 --> 1039.439
it might be true like they might be

1036.319 --> 1041.76
immortal in a sense that their spirit is

1039.439 --> 1043.76
never going to stop

1041.76 --> 1046.319
right

1043.76 --> 1048.799
so they might be literally just in

1046.319 --> 1050.1599999999999
weight on the other side maybe even

1048.799 --> 1054.6399999999999
trying to get it

1050.16 --> 1056.88
away back to remanifesting or something

1054.64 --> 1058.4
can be very spooky and then yeah are

1056.88 --> 1062.2
they gonna

1058.4 --> 1062.2
are they gonna prioritize

1064.48 --> 1068.799
like

1065.76 --> 1070.64
being good gods or have they just become

1068.799 --> 1072.32
so desperate

1070.64 --> 1075.8400000000001
that they just

1072.32 --> 1077.76
no matter what just want to get back

1075.84 --> 1078.9599999999998
right it's like what are these gods what

1077.76 --> 1081.44
are they like

1078.96 --> 1084.0
what what is it like to to be a son of

1081.44 --> 1085.679
god and to say nephilim well that's

1084.0 --> 1090.16
again different

1085.679 --> 1091.76
because the nephilim well hercules

1090.16 --> 1093.1200000000001
perseus

1091.76 --> 1096.24
heritage

1093.12 --> 1098.4799999999998
precious they would have been nephilim

1096.24 --> 1098.48
right

1099.52 --> 1104.48
and that the sons of god i don't think

1102.16 --> 1109.3600000000001
that they are nephilim i think that they

1104.48 --> 1111.919
are literally the sons of god

1109.36 --> 1113.76
and that they are not like humans

1111.919 --> 1116.48
and that they may have started to

1113.76 --> 1120.96
interbreed with the humans just like

1116.48 --> 1123.28
zeus did constantly in the mythology

1120.96 --> 1125.44
and that that way

1123.28 --> 1127.44
well there's even in their mythology

1125.44 --> 1130.64
there are these giants and these

1127.44 --> 1132.64
monsters that allegedly

1130.64 --> 1135.3600000000001
from what i got

1132.64 --> 1137.44
yeah they say it is because of the gods

1135.36 --> 1139.4399999999998
that the gods basically pulled them into

1137.44 --> 1143.6000000000001
the world by accident

1139.44 --> 1143.6000000000001
by their appearance naturally

1144.48 --> 1148.559
so

1146.32 --> 1151.84
it's a bit confusing but it's like it

1148.559 --> 1153.76
has the same pieces it's just that

1151.84 --> 1157.1999999999998
the more christian approach has just

1153.76 --> 1160.4
rearranged the puzzle pieces

1157.2 --> 1162.799
that's what it seems like to me

1160.4 --> 1165.44
and i'm trying to figure out like the

1162.799 --> 1168.24
deeper fractal

1165.44 --> 1170.16
patterns on how to merge it like in

1168.24 --> 1173.44
order to identify

1170.16 --> 1175.76
which fragments of each story are false

1173.44 --> 1180.559
and which ones are real

1175.76 --> 1180.559
in order to get it like a a true merger

1181.039 --> 1188.039
not to create a new religion but to

1183.679 --> 1188.039
understand what was real

1193.36 --> 1199.1999999999998
take the stories

1195.36 --> 1202.0
they seem identical you start to like

1199.2 --> 1205.0
figure out how do they connect

1202.0 --> 1205.0
right

1210.32 --> 1215.28
and then once you figure out this is how

1212.48 --> 1216.08
it really merges then you start to see

1215.28 --> 1217.28
which

1216.08 --> 1220.32
parts are

1217.28 --> 1223.28
added on which parts are of a separated

1220.32 --> 1226.3999999999999
story are added on to keep it unique and

1223.28 --> 1230.6399999999999
basically to not let it merger

1226.4 --> 1233.2
automatically to not have it be lost

1230.64 --> 1234.88
keep it unique

1233.2 --> 1236.88
keep it separated

1234.88 --> 1239.44
that it doesn't seem compatible to those

1236.88 --> 1241.2
that are fanatical about it

1239.44 --> 1244.559
but that if you

1241.2 --> 1247.1200000000001
truly try to merge the stories

1244.559 --> 1249.9189999999999
you will be able to do it and just you

1247.12 --> 1251.6789999999999
just have to cut off

1249.919 --> 1253.1200000000001
the added on parts that were

1251.679 --> 1256.5590000000002
specifically

1253.12 --> 1258.4799999999998
put onto it to keep it unique

1256.559 --> 1260.24
in order to understand what about it is

1258.48 --> 1263.24
real

1260.24 --> 1263.24
huh

1263.44 --> 1267.919
so

1264.24 --> 1267.919
a little bit esoteric i think

1272.53 --> 1277.789
[Music]

1282.73 --> 1287.079
[Music]

1287.6 --> 1293.039
but one thing that i am like very

1290.0 --> 1294.88
fascinated by is looking at like this

1293.039 --> 1296.8799999999999
greek mythologies

1294.88 --> 1299.5400000000002
through the lens of certain types of

1296.88 --> 1301.0390000000002
knowledge like how power corrupts

1299.54 --> 1303.52
[Music]

1301.039 --> 1306.1589999999999
like as a universal rule

1303.52 --> 1306.1589999999999
and it is

1306.48 --> 1309.84
very interesting

1308.4 --> 1311.8400000000001
because

1309.84 --> 1314.6399999999999
the gods

1311.84 --> 1316.08
are like or the god the pantheon the

1314.64 --> 1317.3600000000001
little gods

1316.08 --> 1318.559
sons of god

1317.36 --> 1321.28
are like

1318.559 --> 1322.1589999999999
extremely power they are the epitome of

1321.28 --> 1325.84
their

1322.159 --> 1328.48
unique power they are like the one

1325.84 --> 1330.32
part in the frequency the absolute power

1328.48 --> 1332.72
of their powers

1330.32 --> 1335.28
and so absolute power would corrupt

1332.72 --> 1337.44
absolutely by the rule

1335.28 --> 1339.44
although it's based on nature

1337.44 --> 1341.76
of course and they are sons of god so

1339.44 --> 1344.3200000000002
it's slightly different but

1341.76 --> 1346.48
like every character in the mythology

1344.32 --> 1348.48
all have their

1346.48 --> 1351.6
dwellings like

1348.48 --> 1353.84
their earthliness that they assimilate

1351.6 --> 1356.3999999999999
they became that part of the earthlines

1353.84 --> 1357.4399999999998
it's like their curse like zeus has this

1356.4 --> 1359.679
curse

1357.44 --> 1361.3600000000001
that he just constantly keeps falling in

1359.679 --> 1362.48
love with

1361.36 --> 1364.799
human

1362.48 --> 1367.84
women

1364.799 --> 1369.9189999999999
and a hero just can't get over freaking

1367.84 --> 1372.32
being jealous

1369.919 --> 1374.7990000000002
right those are weaknesses those are

1372.32 --> 1376.48
weaknesses that shape them entirely as

1374.799 --> 1377.52
to what they do where they go what they

1376.48 --> 1380.159
think

1377.52 --> 1382.08
so with all their power in hand their

1380.159 --> 1386.3200000000002
actual minds

1382.08 --> 1386.32
seem to have become very vulnerable

1387.28 --> 1391.52
and that is probably the curse is that

1389.48 --> 1394.08
[Music]

1391.52 --> 1396.799
underneath it all they are very

1394.08 --> 1396.799
typically

1398.24 --> 1402.32
based on human weaknesses in their

1400.24 --> 1404.559
character

1402.32 --> 1404.559
huh

1410.0 --> 1416.48
anyway i've been thinking about it a lot

1413.31 --> 1416.48
[Music]

1424.32 --> 1428.279
hello psychics traveler

1437.62 --> 1440.6699999999998
[Music]

1441.52 --> 1446.72
right but it's also just interesting to

1445.6 --> 1449.4399999999998
it's like

1446.72 --> 1450.72
look this christian perspective right

1449.44 --> 1452.4
like on

1450.72 --> 1455.1200000000001
the pantheon and like oh they're the

1452.4 --> 1457.3600000000001
fallen ones and who never give in to

1455.12 --> 1458.8799999999999
like they're purely demonic but the

1457.36 --> 1460.559
thing is

1458.88 --> 1463.0390000000002
it's not entirely correct if you look at

1460.559 --> 1465.6789999999999
the mythology that's not correct it's

1463.039 --> 1467.039
like yeah

1465.679 --> 1471.039
they

1467.039 --> 1472.559
caused the demons

1471.039 --> 1473.52
why how

1472.559 --> 1477.36
by

1473.52 --> 1482.24
being the opposite in the material realm

1477.36 --> 1485.6789999999999
they they manif their power manifested

1482.24 --> 1489.039
the other side of the coin you could say

1485.679 --> 1491.3600000000001
and so they would bring trouble just by

1489.039 --> 1493.279
their presence it's not it's like oh

1491.36 --> 1494.24
let's bring a god back into the world

1493.279 --> 1498.24
yeah

1494.24 --> 1500.64
oh that's not dangerous at all i mean

1498.24 --> 1502.159
yeah if you do that might be that one of

1500.64 --> 1504.72
these

1502.159 --> 1506.0800000000002
demonic giants also

1504.72 --> 1507.679
comes back

1506.08 --> 1509.9189999999999
again

1507.679 --> 1509.919
right

1510.24 --> 1515.84
in in that context

1513.76 --> 1518.48
so i think like no

1515.84 --> 1520.9599999999998
don't over simplify everything always

1518.48 --> 1523.039
oversimplifying everything always just

1520.96 --> 1524.72
polarizing black and white

1523.039 --> 1529.039
you're with us or you're against us

1524.72 --> 1531.84
you're with god or you're with the devil

1529.039 --> 1534.72
right it's

1531.84 --> 1534.72
unrealistic

1540.64 --> 1545.3600000000001
although i that doesn't mean that i

1542.32 --> 1548.799
recommend that you like oh yeah just go

1545.36 --> 1548.799
with the little g's then

1551.2 --> 1555.76
the entire lesson about it through

1552.96 --> 1558.32
mythology is that all power comes with

1555.76 --> 1561.36
the price

1558.32 --> 1563.76
so if you are going to mingle with that

1561.36 --> 1563.76
power

1564.4 --> 1571.039
then you will probably attract a similar

1568.08 --> 1573.1999999999998
price and and this even counts whether

1571.039 --> 1574.96
whether it's like through some kind of

1573.2 --> 1577.44
form of worship

1574.96 --> 1579.679
in this life or whether you simply live

1577.44 --> 1581.8400000000001
by that sort of frequency it doesn't

1579.679 --> 1585.72
really matter it's just how it happens

1581.84 --> 1585.72
it's designed like this

1586.4 --> 1589.44
right so in the end

1590.72 --> 1595.279
it's all right even for the christians

1592.799 --> 1597.6
to see it like that it's super over

1595.279 --> 1599.6
simplified but

1597.6 --> 1602.48
it is sensible enough

1599.6 --> 1602.48
to stay away

1604.72 --> 1609.039
especially if you make a habit of kind

1606.72 --> 1610.96
of like avoiding information because

1609.039 --> 1612.48
you're afraid of the devil

1610.96 --> 1614.0
yeah

1612.48 --> 1616.48
if you

1614.0 --> 1618.559
do that then don't

1616.48 --> 1622.3600000000001
don't go after the little g

1618.559 --> 1622.36
don't attract them

1626.48 --> 1628.799
because yeah

1627.919 --> 1630.72
if you

1628.799 --> 1632.4
contact them

1630.72 --> 1635.039
i see it as a

1632.4 --> 1638.0800000000002
like a mechanical likelihood that

1635.039 --> 1641.76
the demons the other side also

1638.08 --> 1642.8799999999999
basically tries to get in the way

1641.76 --> 1644.64
right

1642.88 --> 1647.44
and

1644.64 --> 1649.76
even internally it all depends like oh

1647.44 --> 1652.0800000000002
it's so complicated like it's all with

1649.76 --> 1654.1589999999999
the intention where you are are in your

1652.08 --> 1656.32
life whether something comes randomly to

1654.159 --> 1659.1200000000001
you or whether you've always built up

1656.32 --> 1660.72
towards it in your life with expectation

1659.12 --> 1663.84
these things matter

1660.72 --> 1666.08
for the interaction right because

1663.84 --> 1668.8799999999999
what if you were a woman and like zeus

1666.08 --> 1671.12
came suddenly came out or like threw

1668.88 --> 1673.2
somebody else i don't know man

1671.12 --> 1675.52
something really bizarre happens and you

1673.2 --> 1676.799
just become tied in with the gods little

1675.52 --> 1677.6
g's

1676.799 --> 1679.84
well

1677.6 --> 1682.24
they don't have to necessarily have

1679.84 --> 1685.1999999999998
demons after it's just freaking hera one

1682.24 --> 1687.44
of the other gods

1685.2 --> 1689.76
right

1687.44 --> 1691.3600000000001
so it doesn't have to be a literal demon

1689.76 --> 1694.84
it might just be

1691.36 --> 1698.559
the earthly traits

1694.84 --> 1702.799
responding within godly power that might

1698.559 --> 1705.12
be the problem not even demonic

1702.799 --> 1705.12
doom

1705.44 --> 1712.0
and in that sense you could categorize

1708.08 --> 1716.32
the the gods among luciferian

1712.0 --> 1719.6
like its power it's dangerous

1716.32 --> 1721.279
it may potentially lead to the dark side

1719.6 --> 1723.6
to ariman

1721.279 --> 1725.12
according to rudolf steiner logic right

1723.6 --> 1726.24
so it all

1725.12 --> 1731.2399999999998
fits

1726.24 --> 1731.24
it all fits all of it

1744.399 --> 1749.1999999999998
i think that rudolph steiner

1746.88 --> 1753.0800000000002
that his cosmology

1749.2 --> 1753.0800000000002
i think it's very compatible

1755.2 --> 1760.96
with the old pantheon idea

1759.36 --> 1763.279
and the funny thing is is that he

1760.96 --> 1766.3990000000001
probably if you i have never even read

1763.279 --> 1767.36
all of ruto steiner's work i only get

1766.399 --> 1769.36
things

1767.36 --> 1771.6789999999999
through other people that have that then

1769.36 --> 1773.6789999999999
relay messages to me because i

1771.679 --> 1776.0800000000002
i have some of his books but i find it a

1773.679 --> 1778.3990000000001
bit tedious to read sometimes and it's

1776.08 --> 1781.36
all also like yeah yeah i get the point

1778.399 --> 1784.8799999999999
man i get it that's how i think too

1781.36 --> 1784.8799999999999
a lot of the time so it's just like

1787.52 --> 1791.44
it's not even that revolutionary to me

1789.76 --> 1794.0
anymore i've already through other

1791.44 --> 1796.159
people indirectly listen to so much of

1794.0 --> 1798.64
his insights

1796.159 --> 1800.48
and have accepted them very early on

1798.64 --> 1802.7990000000002
it's like

1800.48 --> 1804.96
i don't understand it but that guy

1802.799 --> 1807.6
understands more than me and he seems to

1804.96 --> 1810.3990000000001
follow a pattern that i can migrate to

1807.6 --> 1811.9189999999999
and seem sensible with my spirit

1810.399 --> 1813.9189999999999
on that frequency and that's what i've

1811.919 --> 1815.76
done very young

1813.919 --> 1817.679
went to a walter school took it

1815.76 --> 1819.919
extremely serious that's where i got my

1817.679 --> 1822.2800000000002
greek mythology too

1819.919 --> 1825.46
right it's

1822.28 --> 1825.46
[Music]

1827.6 --> 1831.279
it's all pretty heavy

1833.12 --> 1837.84
and that's how i experienced it as a kid

1839.12 --> 1844.9599999999998
everybody's like oh no it's all fake and

1842.32 --> 1846.8799999999999
all just stories oh it's just

1844.96 --> 1848.48
dreams don't mean anything oh it's just

1846.88 --> 1852.3990000000001
a myth

1848.48 --> 1854.799
and i'm like dude this is all real man

1852.399 --> 1857.76
i don't understand yet how but i know

1854.799 --> 1860.08
it's real i can feel it i can see things

1857.76 --> 1860.08
coming

1863.6 --> 1868.24
and everybody just thought that it was a

1865.36 --> 1868.24
bit loopy

1896.48 --> 1902.48
hello ja ja light holy bee

1900.08 --> 1902.48
hello

1904.799 --> 1907.84
holly b

1916.0 --> 1921.159
titans existed yeah i'm sure they did

1932.72 --> 1937.039
and giants titans and giants are

1935.36 --> 1940.0
different though

1937.039 --> 1940.0
gotta realize that

1944.399 --> 1948.399
giants are

1946.32 --> 1951.519
mostly human

1948.399 --> 1954.799
they look more human

1951.519 --> 1958.2
titans probably weren't even flesh

1954.799 --> 1958.2
in that sense

1985.919 --> 1988.919
hmm

2010.159 --> 2014.279
what are you talking about dominoid

2026.08 --> 2030.96
zeus was their personification of

2028.32 --> 2032.48
jupiter no

2030.96 --> 2033.3600000000001
no

2032.48 --> 2035.0
there

2033.36 --> 2038.399
the greek were

2035.0 --> 2039.76
unequivocally first romans were like

2038.399 --> 2042.32
parasites

2039.76 --> 2044.32
to the greek mythology

2042.32 --> 2047.279
they literally

2044.32 --> 2049.679
like rome was much more industrious and

2047.279 --> 2051.119
all that

2049.679 --> 2054.2400000000002
they were not

2051.119 --> 2056.96
very spiritual they stole almost

2054.24 --> 2059.2799999999997
everything they were more like the borg

2056.96 --> 2060.399
they just assimilated [ __ ]

2059.28 --> 2063.9190000000003
and then

2060.399 --> 2066.56
wove it into their version of it

2063.919 --> 2067.839
but they were like a reversed world they

2066.56 --> 2071.839
just like

2067.839 --> 2073.359
turned everything into their own version

2071.839 --> 2075.839
and like

2073.359 --> 2078.24
effectively corrupted the integrity of

2075.839 --> 2081.44
the stories from which they assimilated

2078.24 --> 2083.1189999999997
so they were like destroyers in a way

2081.44 --> 2085.119
to us it's like oh wow the road

2083.119 --> 2087.44
mythology that's incredible

2085.119 --> 2089.599
right it's so similar yeah but the

2087.44 --> 2092.48
greeks were actually really honoring

2089.599 --> 2095.119
that mythology

2092.48 --> 2096.32
took it very serious rome

2095.119 --> 2098.48
dude

2096.32 --> 2103.2400000000002
it was just power

2098.48 --> 2103.2400000000002
most of it was just a power call

2104.0 --> 2107.599
rome was not nice

2107.68 --> 2113.359
they were very amoral

2111.04 --> 2115.68
even though like at the grassroots you

2113.359 --> 2119.839
know the soldiers did have pretty decent

2115.68 --> 2121.68
racing and it was all very pragmatic and

2119.839 --> 2123.04
well mechanical they knew what they were

2121.68 --> 2125.1189999999997
doing

2123.04 --> 2129.2
like what was good for you how to become

2125.119 --> 2130.88
better and how to yeah stare progress

2129.2 --> 2133.04
right

2130.88 --> 2136.079
but

2133.04 --> 2140.0
they didn't actually like believe

2136.079 --> 2142.2400000000002
their own stories it was just

2140.0 --> 2144.16
like oh we're just as good as them look

2142.24 --> 2146.0789999999997
we got that story it's just the road

2144.16 --> 2148.48
just like the roman catholics did just

2146.079 --> 2151.44
assimilate everything

2148.48 --> 2151.44
to take it over

2153.359 --> 2158.88
not because it's their sacred tradition

2156.64 --> 2160.16
that they defend against change in the

2158.88 --> 2163.32
world

2160.16 --> 2163.3199999999997
the opposite

2182.95 --> 2186.7999999999997
[Music]

2185.119 --> 2188.6600000000003
yeah the holy bee

2186.8 --> 2189.8390000000004
you don't know if the giants died out

2188.66 --> 2191.92
[Music]

2189.839 --> 2195.2
they've been giant spotted

2191.92 --> 2197.44
even in 21st century

2195.2 --> 2201.1189999999997
in afghanistan

2197.44 --> 2203.44
on camera by us soldiers

2201.119 --> 2203.44
and

2204.8 --> 2210.0
there might very well be entire

2207.2 --> 2214.4399999999996
continents field of giants that are

2210.0 --> 2214.44
outside of our maps

2250.4 --> 2254.7200000000003
okay psychics traveler

2252.4 --> 2259.1600000000003
that's cool they had a story about it so

2254.72 --> 2259.16
are you going to share what that was

2283.76 --> 2287.44
because if you're just gonna say oh they

2285.76 --> 2289.3590000000004
had an interesting story and then you

2287.44 --> 2290.2400000000002
walk away

2289.359 --> 2293.68
that's

2290.24 --> 2293.68
that's a shitty thing to do

2295.2 --> 2300.0789999999997
but you're just gonna expect us to find

2297.359 --> 2303.119
out exactly what it is

2300.079 --> 2303.119
without any hint

2310.64 --> 2316.8799999999997
the old religions have the best stories

2313.599 --> 2318.8
well yeah because they were

2316.88 --> 2321.44
sharpened the most right

2318.8 --> 2324.32
when a religion or

2321.44 --> 2326.64
rather storytelling tradition

2324.32 --> 2329.599
the only way it survives is by being

2326.64 --> 2332.3199999999997
passed on and remembered correctly

2329.599 --> 2334.0
yeah you better well really tell it well

2332.32 --> 2336.32
enough

2334.0 --> 2338.8
it has to be memorable it has to stick

2336.32 --> 2338.8
to mind

2338.839 --> 2344.0789999999997
right so

2340.96 --> 2345.839
it will start to play onto typical

2344.079 --> 2348.6400000000003
iconography

2345.839 --> 2352.32
that functions with the mindsets that

2348.64 --> 2352.3199999999997
are going to assimilate it

2352.8 --> 2358.0
it's like the earliest form of social

2356.0 --> 2360.88
engineering it's just like

2358.0 --> 2362.64
just understand on like the range of

2360.88 --> 2365.04
people that you typically get and the

2362.64 --> 2366.8799999999997
next generation and the next generation

2365.04 --> 2369.04
what they will be like

2366.88 --> 2372.079
how they will remember things

2369.04 --> 2374.72
and then tell it in a way

2372.079 --> 2378.52
or keep trying until it works

2374.72 --> 2378.52
until it sticks

2404.0 --> 2407.0
what

2419.44 --> 2423.0
i don't get it

2425.359 --> 2428.16
what what's the point here psychics

2427.119 --> 2430.1600000000003
traveler

2428.16 --> 2431.839
it's the worship of the norse god the

2430.16 --> 2435.92
religion does not

2431.839 --> 2440.96
only oh what not only it doesn't only

2435.92 --> 2445.4
of the god right worship of giants okay

2440.96 --> 2445.4
but aren't those like the opponents

2455.92 --> 2459.2000000000003
i mean that's

2457.119 --> 2460.6400000000003
very similar to like in the in the greek

2459.2 --> 2463.4399999999996
pantheon

2460.64 --> 2466.56
where the giants there

2463.44 --> 2468.48
are basically demons and yet there are

2466.56 --> 2472.92
even in the story there's people that

2468.48 --> 2472.92
are like their cultists

2482.24 --> 2487.319
is that what you mean sidekicks traveler

2520.64 --> 2525.1189999999997
you're still here well i'm asking you a

2522.56 --> 2528.24
question

2525.119 --> 2532.52
what are you waiting for

2528.24 --> 2532.52
don't you understand the question

2543.119 --> 2547.28
here to tell stories you brought it up

2548.24 --> 2553.4399999999996
but you're only here to consume

2551.2 --> 2555.839
to listen to my stories and blabber

2553.44 --> 2559.64
incoherently is that what you're here to

2555.839 --> 2559.64
do psychics traveler

2567.68 --> 2571.93
i can't say that's a great attitude for

2569.92 --> 2579.62
my workshop

2571.93 --> 2579.62
[Music]

2630.24 --> 2633.24
man

2656.96 --> 2659.96
dude

2664.8 --> 2668.5600000000004
i think i've

2666.319 --> 2670.8
said a lot already

2668.56 --> 2673.359
i guess that if i really want to have a

2670.8 --> 2673.3590000000004
serious

2673.68 --> 2678.29
reflection on these things i should just

2675.76 --> 2680.6400000000003
probably pre-record

2678.29 --> 2682.96
[Music]

2680.64 --> 2682.96
because

2683.92 --> 2689.2400000000002
interactive responses seem so rare

2694.24 --> 2698.1189999999997
yes you do

2701.51 --> 2704.809
[Music]

2738.8 --> 2741.8
uh

2770.319 --> 2773.2
right

2771.28 --> 2775.8390000000004
so anything else

2773.2 --> 2778.0789999999997
i think i put down a giant chunk of

2775.839 --> 2780.7999999999997
information with

2778.079 --> 2783.2000000000003
infinite potential

2780.8 --> 2785.52
and cross references to pretty much

2783.2 --> 2787.1189999999997
anything that really matters that you've

2785.52 --> 2788.8
ever heard of

2787.119 --> 2791.04
but i mean

2788.8 --> 2792.0
why in choir

2791.04 --> 2793.2
yeah

2792.0 --> 2795.119
i mean

2793.2 --> 2797.4399999999996
i'm only an oracle

2795.119 --> 2800.079
why would you ask me anything when you

2797.44 --> 2803.7200000000003
can just hang around and [ __ ] waste

2800.079 --> 2803.7200000000003
my time then

2804.48 --> 2807.48
huh

2818.4 --> 2824.319
don't have enough knowledge to comment

2821.359 --> 2824.319
how would you know

2825.52 --> 2830.079
how would you know until you actually

2827.28 --> 2832.1600000000003
tested it

2830.079 --> 2834.2400000000002
what is stopping you

2832.16 --> 2836.72
from inquiring

2834.24 --> 2839.04
from reflecting it what have you never

2836.72 --> 2840.9599999999996
heard of greek mythology or any

2839.04 --> 2844.4
mythology

2840.96 --> 2846.559
research into atlantis like all of it is

2844.4 --> 2848.8
if you've done any research on any of

2846.559 --> 2850.88
these fields you will have information

2848.8 --> 2851.92
to reflect upon everything that i just

2850.88 --> 2854.5
said

2851.92 --> 2856.839
are you telling me you have

2854.5 --> 2859.28
[Music]

2856.839 --> 2860.96
nothing what have you been doing then

2859.28 --> 2865.28
all this time on the net

2860.96 --> 2865.28
watching videos if you have nothing

2867.52 --> 2871.319
hey adam price

2875.1 --> 2885.839
[Music]

2882.72 --> 2887.04
yes you agree with me

2885.839 --> 2890.4
that's

2887.04 --> 2893.599
okay if you mean please leave me alone

2890.4 --> 2894.559
i'm too toasty or whatever

2893.599 --> 2897.2000000000003
fine

2894.559 --> 2899.0400000000004
it's sunday morning for you and all that

2897.2 --> 2901.2
i get it

2899.04 --> 2903.359
but you do have information you're

2901.2 --> 2906.0789999999997
probably just toasty

2903.359 --> 2909.119
or whatever and hey i don't blame you i

2906.079 --> 2912.4
was very freaking toasty

2909.119 --> 2915.04
yesterday evening on ball busters

2912.4 --> 2919.44
barely said anything

2915.04 --> 2919.44
because i felt so freaking sleepy

2924.88 --> 2928.359
hey gaining wisdom

2934.079 --> 2937.28
right yeah getting wisdom

2941.04 --> 2944.16
yeah i think that

2944.48 --> 2949.599
the greek mythology

2946.48 --> 2952.079
is actually based on real figures that

2949.599 --> 2954.1600000000003
really existed that directly correlate

2952.079 --> 2957.52
with what atlantis was

2954.16 --> 2961.839
the pre-flood empire they were the ruler

2957.52 --> 2964.72
so it was probably not a human empire

2961.839 --> 2967.119
and they basically [ __ ] it up

2964.72 --> 2970.64
how did they [ __ ] it up well

2967.119 --> 2974.4
giants just like the bible says as well

2970.64 --> 2977.359
were their opponents they by probably

2974.4 --> 2979.2000000000003
accidentally summoned them

2977.359 --> 2982.88
just by coming

2979.2 --> 2985.4399999999996
on the realm this ending as sons of god

2982.88 --> 2988.88
and doing what they did mingling with

2985.44 --> 2990.8
mankind like zeus

2988.88 --> 2994.559
i think that it is like

2990.8 --> 2995.6800000000003
it is it they were real

2994.559 --> 2999.4
and that's

2995.68 --> 2999.3999999999996
how and when

2999.92 --> 3004.88
and yeah from the christian perspective

3002.88 --> 3008.559
it would all be fallen angel and fallen

3004.88 --> 3008.559
angel technology and there's

3009.2 --> 3015.359
there is an element to that it and it is

3012.88 --> 3017.359
like power power corruption

3015.359 --> 3019.2799999999997
if there's so much power there will be a

3017.359 --> 3021.92
counter power

3019.28 --> 3026.28
like that happens and so if the gods

3021.92 --> 3026.28
came to earth to rule it

3026.88 --> 3030.2400000000002
then

3028.16 --> 3031.92
the demons arised

3030.24 --> 3035.04
to counter that

3031.92 --> 3037.04
and so they may have been like mistaken

3035.04 --> 3040.24
even with their presence and that is why

3037.04 --> 3042.079
they left it seems even in the mythology

3040.24 --> 3043.839
that they left

3042.079 --> 3044.8
they

3043.839 --> 3046.319
just

3044.8 --> 3049.599
went away

3046.319 --> 3049.599
they might have died

3050.559 --> 3056.0
like their physical incarnation

3052.88 --> 3058.559
or they simply just retreated out of the

3056.0 --> 3059.76
physical existence again back to the

3058.559 --> 3062.4
more eden

3059.76 --> 3062.4
type state

3064.0 --> 3069.839
right and that would be the sons of god

3066.88 --> 3073.04
going back to daddy you could say

3069.839 --> 3075.839
but at the same time demons the counter

3073.04 --> 3076.96
forces where are they gonna retract you

3075.839 --> 3078.88
they're just

3076.96 --> 3082.0
on earth asleep

3078.88 --> 3083.599
or locked in tartarus

3082.0 --> 3086.8
but i don't think they're the same i

3083.599 --> 3086.8
think they are separate

3086.96 --> 3092.7200000000003
i mean

3088.16 --> 3095.2799999999997
if the sons of god would come to earth

3092.72 --> 3097.9199999999996
how could they be evil when you believe

3095.28 --> 3100.7200000000003
that jesus christ was the son of god to

3097.92 --> 3100.7200000000003
come to earth

3100.96 --> 3108.079
when in the bible the sons of god did

3104.16 --> 3110.8799999999997
this it's like you just basic basic

3108.079 --> 3113.28
rudimentary word logic words and their

3110.88 --> 3113.28
meaning

3114.88 --> 3118.88
so i don't think that the fallen angels

3117.839 --> 3122.319
are

3118.88 --> 3122.319
literally the sons of god

3122.96 --> 3127.2
maybe the fallen angels

3125.76 --> 3129.5200000000004
are that

3127.2 --> 3132.96
are the ones that created the demons

3129.52 --> 3135.68
that the sons of god came to the earth

3132.96 --> 3137.52
with the with mankind it's like okay

3135.68 --> 3139.5989999999997
adam moves out and then the sons of god

3137.52 --> 3141.359
are like oh yeah we wow with this new

3139.599 --> 3143.839
time-based realm we want to be part of

3141.359 --> 3145.44
it and they manifest with an earthly

3143.839 --> 3147.52
incarnation bang

3145.44 --> 3149.92
god's probably not very happy because it

3147.52 --> 3153.359
was yes freaking experiment for humanity

3149.92 --> 3155.599
so daddy big daddy angry at the gods

3153.359 --> 3158.0789999999997
effectively curses them

3155.599 --> 3161.04
and angels

3158.079 --> 3162.2400000000002
which are part of that divine circle

3161.04 --> 3163.839
thing

3162.24 --> 3165.4399999999996
servants

3163.839 --> 3167.2
rebel

3165.44 --> 3168.0
and go down

3167.2 --> 3170.8799999999997
and

3168.0 --> 3173.04
well form the opponent form the evil

3170.88 --> 3175.359
giants at which the gods have to then

3173.04 --> 3175.359
fight

3175.76 --> 3179.599
until they

3177.359 --> 3181.359
go away

3179.599 --> 3184.3590000000004
it's all

3181.359 --> 3184.359
poof

3209.119 --> 3212.96
right i i'm just trying to reconstruct

3211.92 --> 3215.04
yeah

3212.96 --> 3218.2400000000002
trying to figure out how it really

3215.04 --> 3221.44
happened like every factor every factor

3218.24 --> 3224.0
including what the scribes or the

3221.44 --> 3226.559
priests with their religious view and

3224.0 --> 3229.04
their lust for domination over the human

3226.559 --> 3231.92
mind what everything that they erased

3229.04 --> 3235.2
were like recategorized locked out right

3231.92 --> 3238.16
i'm like yeah i'm gonna take all of that

3235.2 --> 3242.0
and do all the human priestly tricks and

3238.16 --> 3244.8799999999997
unify it into the truth of what really

3242.0 --> 3250.04
happened here in this realm

3244.88 --> 3250.04
what happened in history for real

3250.24 --> 3254.8799999999997
are the actual elements that are here

3255.599 --> 3260.88
the creator the designer eden

3259.28 --> 3262.7200000000003
the timeless

3260.88 --> 3264.96
proto realm

3262.72 --> 3266.7999999999997
of all life where god the designer

3264.96 --> 3268.96
created all life

3266.8 --> 3270.96
then the the earthly realm the 3d

3268.96 --> 3272.2400000000002
time-bound realm

3270.96 --> 3276.0
and all its

3272.24 --> 3278.64
issues and seductions and death

3276.0 --> 3279.839
and the gods entering it too

3278.64 --> 3282.96
probably

3279.839 --> 3285.44
not in accordance to the will

3282.96 --> 3287.599
of the designer

3285.44 --> 3290.96
cursing the place

3287.599 --> 3294.4
causing the flood causing demonic

3290.96 --> 3296.559
elements to come into being really for

3294.4 --> 3298.559
true evil probably came into being in

3296.559 --> 3299.8390000000004
reflection to the gods entering the

3298.559 --> 3301.92
realm

3299.839 --> 3304.88
the fallen angels you could say that

3301.92 --> 3308.64
rebelled against the gods

3304.88 --> 3310.4
the little g gods the sons of god

3308.64 --> 3312.72
see

3310.4 --> 3316.96
it's just a couple of pieces you just

3312.72 --> 3319.52
put it right there and it fits it fits

3316.96 --> 3323.28
it's complete now

3319.52 --> 3323.28
no more missing links

3328.96 --> 3333.64
the hell are you talking about kona

3330.64 --> 3333.64
power

3347.52 --> 3354.0
am i writing your own version no it no

3349.76 --> 3354.0
it's not gonna be the bible borders boy

3358.079 --> 3362.96
i'm not gonna re write the bible the

3360.72 --> 3364.24
bible can be the bible as much as it

3362.96 --> 3367.76
likes

3364.24 --> 3367.7599999999998
and i i can't really

3368.4 --> 3372.7200000000003
i

3369.119 --> 3374.7200000000003
i don't feel i have it in me to like

3372.72 --> 3377.68
like restore

3374.72 --> 3380.64
jesus jesus's original life story or

3377.68 --> 3384.64
something and still have it be

3380.64 --> 3384.64
as a bible i don't have that in me

3388.48 --> 3392.559
i'm leaving the bible alone like that

3390.72 --> 3394.0789999999997
now this is about

3392.559 --> 3399.48
like

3394.079 --> 3399.48
everything else everything in between

3422.88 --> 3428.1600000000003
right if i'd write something like this

3424.88 --> 3430.839
and hey guys i am writing it i'm

3428.16 --> 3433.7599999999998
dictating it it's being

3430.839 --> 3437.52
recorded like a scribe is writing it

3433.76 --> 3438.48
down for me except in a digital forum

3437.52 --> 3440.4
right

3438.48 --> 3442.079
it's writing nonetheless

3440.4 --> 3444.4
but i've been

3442.079 --> 3446.2400000000002
writing the story i had a proto version

3444.4 --> 3448.88
of this

3446.24 --> 3452.5589999999997
and now i got more details

3448.88 --> 3452.559
that i didn't understand before

3453.359 --> 3457.92
remember

3455.599 --> 3457.92
where is

3459.2 --> 3462.64
hey it that thing

3464.079 --> 3467.28
it's that reddit page

3468.4 --> 3470.64
dude

3472.24 --> 3475.839
where the hell did that go

3476.16 --> 3479.7599999999998
oh right history of the world in the

3478.4 --> 3482.4
dimensions

3479.76 --> 3487.7990000000004
right no i made uh

3482.4 --> 3487.799
a video series about it like years ago

3488.48 --> 3493.119
and this is just like a very rough

3493.92 --> 3499.28
work although yeah the dimensions part

3496.319 --> 3503.2799999999997
still hold up a lot of it

3499.28 --> 3505.92
and even the rough order of the history

3503.28 --> 3505.92
holds up

3507.28 --> 3512.079
right because it is more like an

3509.359 --> 3515.04
expression of frequency

3512.079 --> 3517.44
within how it all went

3515.04 --> 3519.68
then it even is like very specific

3517.44 --> 3522.4
history this is more about the pattern

3519.68 --> 3522.3999999999996
of history

3526.16 --> 3530.7599999999998
what's the topic of the composite dude

3540.13 --> 3558.719
[Music]

3567.2 --> 3571.2799999999997
so i'm just gonna call it after the

3569.2 --> 3575.0
title i don't know how to make it any

3571.28 --> 3575.0
more clear than that

3604.88 --> 3614.36
[Music]

3636.72 --> 3640.4399999999996
little guided inspector

3647.119 --> 3650.119
nsg

3664.16 --> 3668.5589999999997
putting zeus a little under a hundred

3666.72 --> 3673.64
percent mark

3668.559 --> 3673.6400000000003
and virtue shooting of the what

3685.119 --> 3688.48
but what are you saying

3686.559 --> 3691.76
getting i didn't understand what it is

3688.48 --> 3691.76
you're literally saying

3692.0 --> 3695.839
maybe try using

3694.24 --> 3699.839
points and

3695.839 --> 3702.799
like commas and actually make a cohesive

3699.839 --> 3707.5589999999997
sentence not just type raw words like

3702.799 --> 3707.559
your computer and then enter

3743.28 --> 3745.6800000000003
fine

3751.68 --> 3758.24
but yes it's basically what it is i'm

3754.16 --> 3758.24
comparing bible cosmology

3759.039 --> 3763.6800000000003
with the pantheon with the sons of god

3761.599 --> 3766.4
and the fallen angels and the giants and

3763.68 --> 3766.3999999999996
the floods

3766.72 --> 3769.72
eden

3770.0 --> 3774.319
all of that comparing it to the greek

3772.72 --> 3776.0789999999997
mythology

3774.319 --> 3778.88
pantheon

3776.079 --> 3782.6400000000003
what they were doing how they were doing

3778.88 --> 3785.839
it it was all about their power

3782.64 --> 3789.0389999999998
i think that they were the sons of god

3785.839 --> 3791.52
it did its base they literally just

3789.039 --> 3791.5200000000004
say it

3792.4 --> 3796.119
like in the stories

3801.44 --> 3806.0
like they are the ruling gods the

3803.76 --> 3807.28
panthers they had have

3806.0 --> 3808.839
fathers

3807.28 --> 3814.3190000000004
they have a

3808.839 --> 3814.319
father they literally just say it

3817.359 --> 3823.119
right and then i'm comparing both

3820.48 --> 3823.119
to my

3823.28 --> 3826.079
dot original

3823.68 --> 3829.68
l chart

3826.079 --> 3829.6800000000003
in which i described

3829.839 --> 3834.24
like the transition pattern of

3834.72 --> 3838.9599999999996
before

3835.839 --> 3841.68
the gods entered the physical realm

3838.96 --> 3847.119
before they got involved

3841.68 --> 3847.1189999999997
and it changed them and they changed it

3850.079 --> 3854.96
the sons of god were angels no

3853.44 --> 3858.16
i don't think so

3854.96 --> 3859.52
unless you declare anything that comes

3858.16 --> 3861.68
from the

3859.52 --> 3863.359
that is the son of god of the designer

3861.68 --> 3864.839
that they are all angels right i don't

3863.359 --> 3869.68
think

3864.839 --> 3869.68
so angels were servants

3871.039 --> 3874.48
like servant class

3877.44 --> 3882.88
right and i think that the sons of god

3880.4 --> 3884.88
came to the earth

3882.88 --> 3885.839
god was not happy with that and i think

3884.88 --> 3888.88
that

3885.839 --> 3891.119
angels rebelled

3888.88 --> 3893.6800000000003
right maybe they did rebel against big

3891.119 --> 3897.039
daddy at first you could say that in a

3893.68 --> 3899.52
way it's also suggested even

3897.039 --> 3901.6800000000003
that they kind of came to earth

3899.52 --> 3904.799
being sons of god

3901.68 --> 3907.2799999999997
and then kind of like against god's will

3904.799 --> 3909.839
because he designated the earth to be

3907.28 --> 3909.8390000000004
man's

3911.44 --> 3915.799
and so it had consequences

3928.319 --> 3932.16
i just don't think that

3930.799 --> 3935.18
yeah

3932.16 --> 3938.37
it's so difficult to even

3935.18 --> 3938.37
[Music]

3941.2 --> 3944.72
because there was just a distinct

3942.88 --> 3947.2000000000003
difference between

3944.72 --> 3950.48
the sons of god and the pantheon and

3947.2 --> 3953.2
their opponents the demons

3950.48 --> 3954.72
like the demons are like

3953.2 --> 3957.0389999999998
true evil

3954.72 --> 3960.5589999999997
the gods were not

3957.039 --> 3961.92
true evil they were just consumed by

3960.559 --> 3965.8390000000004
their power

3961.92 --> 3965.839
reflecting in earthly traits

3985.52 --> 3989.559
right getting wisdom yeah

3993.98 --> 3997.69
[Music]

4011.359 --> 4017.52
right but in a way it makes sense

4015.119 --> 4021.359
right gaining wisdom because

4017.52 --> 4023.359
this idea of humility all the these are

4021.359 --> 4025.839
human traits that are

4023.359 --> 4025.839
i think

4025.92 --> 4032.559
part of humans human design it works

4028.88 --> 4036.0
with us you see we get

4032.559 --> 4037.76
god's mercy and incredible potential and

4036.0 --> 4040.559
forgiveness

4037.76 --> 4041.76
through these human actions well the

4040.559 --> 4044.3190000000004
gods

4041.76 --> 4046.88
the sons of god that came down

4044.319 --> 4050.5589999999997
in earthly carnation

4046.88 --> 4051.839
out of eden into the earth realm

4050.559 --> 4054.079
they

4051.839 --> 4056.96
probably don't get that

4054.079 --> 4058.1600000000003
because they have like

4056.96 --> 4061.599
claimed

4058.16 --> 4064.96
god's power like they have the power

4061.599 --> 4067.599
no mercy for them for god

4064.96 --> 4070.88
from god right they just are that power

4067.599 --> 4076.119
and they have to do everything with that

4070.88 --> 4076.119
and so they've assimilated human traits

4078.4 --> 4083.359
but where humans can find like

4081.119 --> 4086.7200000000003
forgiveness and

4083.359 --> 4089.2799999999997
like a lot of redemption from god

4086.72 --> 4091.52
i don't think they did

4089.28 --> 4093.52
so they just became

4091.52 --> 4098.0
that power

4093.52 --> 4098.0
like walking animated power

4099.759 --> 4105.12
because they were just then holding on

4101.679 --> 4108.4800000000005
to that power even to keep existing so

4105.12 --> 4110.88
they became power incarnate

4108.48 --> 4114.5599999999995
you could say and that's not good

4110.88 --> 4117.92
absolute power corrupts absolutely

4114.56 --> 4118.96
it doesn't automatically make them into

4117.92 --> 4120.319
demons

4118.96 --> 4122.88
though

4120.319 --> 4124.96
because that's a whole dif that's like

4122.88 --> 4128.1990000000005
the power of weakness

4124.96 --> 4128.199
it's different

4134.319 --> 4138.400000000001
it's the inside out demons are the

4136.239 --> 4140.639999999999
inside out

4138.4 --> 4140.639999999999
it's

4144.719 --> 4149.279
not a topic you're really interested in

4146.4 --> 4149.2789999999995
i know just

4149.44 --> 4154.2789999999995
enjoy your sunday gadget inspector

4160.08 --> 4164.159
david reed

4161.92 --> 4166.0
see you in a while

4164.159 --> 4169.0
ale

4166.0 --> 4169.0
hello

4196.08 --> 4198.719
what do you mean

4199.44 --> 4202.799999999999
what do you mean how about the other way

4201.36 --> 4204.48
around

4202.8 --> 4207.1990000000005
psychics traveler

4204.48 --> 4211.48
let's give characters and traits what

4207.199 --> 4211.48
what does that even mean

4240.08 --> 4248.04
let's say we created these stories now

4244.64 --> 4248.04
let's not

4272.159 --> 4277.199
yeah kevlar well i think that

4274.64 --> 4277.1990000000005
they just

4278.08 --> 4283.28
that whole section of the bible is so

4280.88 --> 4285.1990000000005
incredibly cut down

4283.28 --> 4289.599999999999
it's like they cut

4285.199 --> 4289.599999999999
half the entire book out

4289.92 --> 4295.84
like you don't know anything

4293.04 --> 4301.08
anything about the sons of god

4295.84 --> 4301.08
it's like mentioned one freaking time

4301.36 --> 4304.96
yet it is right there

4305.76 --> 4310.63
and it's over like the sentence is

4308.719 --> 4311.76
immediate reminiscent

4310.63 --> 4315.28
[Music]

4311.76 --> 4318.400000000001
reminiscent to zeus like immediately

4315.28 --> 4319.84
right that's just like it's all right

4318.4 --> 4323.199
there

4319.84 --> 4323.1990000000005
in that one sentence

4324.96 --> 4330.88
so i think look the bible is obviously

4328.48 --> 4334.32
a composed

4330.88 --> 4334.32
recreated story

4336.159 --> 4338.96
and

4337.76 --> 4343.84
it's

4338.96 --> 4345.12
been politically cut down

4343.84 --> 4346.88
for power

4345.12 --> 4349.76
because ignorance

4346.88 --> 4350.719
gives you power over man as a demonic

4349.76 --> 4353.1990000000005
power

4350.719 --> 4356.08
and the priesthood which

4353.199 --> 4358.879999999999
has been in christianity or in

4356.08 --> 4359.92
catholicism has been demonic for quite a

4358.88 --> 4363.12
while

4359.92 --> 4366.159
they've become very good at doing that

4363.12 --> 4368.08
apollo is mentioned what where

4366.159 --> 4370.239
really

4368.08 --> 4373.239
where

4370.239 --> 4373.239
what

4390.08 --> 4393.76
what proof from the other side

4397.52 --> 4402.1990000000005
i don't even know how to respond to that

4412.719 --> 4416.4
i don't think i am going to respond to

4414.4 --> 4418.48
you psychic travel i think that you're a

4416.4 --> 4421.36
nag and i think that you're probably a

4418.48 --> 4424.0
drug using weirdo

4421.36 --> 4427.599999999999
that just keeps blabbering incoherently

4424.0 --> 4429.84
and then expects people to tolerate that

4427.6 --> 4432.320000000001
you're very anti-social psychics

4429.84 --> 4432.32
traveler

4435.199 --> 4439.48
and i'm not appreciating it

4450.64 --> 4456.2390000000005
right okay kevlar yeah i'd be very

4453.04 --> 4456.239
curious to hear about that

4457.6 --> 4462.88
i'm just saying i think it's real

4459.679 --> 4462.88
not at all i'm sorry

4462.96 --> 4467.4800000000005
no you are you were earlier

4472.88 --> 4478.4800000000005
maybe you're not drugged up

4476.159 --> 4482.089999999999
but you act like it

4478.48 --> 4482.089999999999
[Music]

4486.32 --> 4492.5599999999995
hey gorzilla good to see you

4489.37 --> 4492.5599999999995
[Music]

4506.48 --> 4508.799999999999
all right

4509.36 --> 4514.08
but look

4511.36 --> 4516.159
the pantheonic gods being atlantis it

4514.08 --> 4519.6
makes perfect sense it makes perfect

4516.159 --> 4522.239
sense with all the religions in the

4519.6 --> 4522.2390000000005
sense that

4522.64 --> 4526.400000000001
they had like

4527.679 --> 4532.88
like the very interface controls of how

4530.239 --> 4534.239
this realm works at their back at their

4532.88 --> 4535.52
beckoning

4534.239 --> 4538.879999999999
and

4535.52 --> 4539.92
it seems perfectly logical

4538.88 --> 4541.679
that

4539.92 --> 4543.52
they would approach

4541.679 --> 4545.36
every

4543.52 --> 4548.080000000001
every group

4545.36 --> 4550.239
and you could even consider that they

4548.08 --> 4553.679
gave them all different

4550.239 --> 4557.04
forms to behold to make themselves the

4553.679 --> 4559.4400000000005
core of their pantheonic religions

4557.04 --> 4561.04
differently

4559.44 --> 4564.799999999999
even to set

4561.04 --> 4564.8
them up against one another

4565.44 --> 4570.5599999999995
that they would literally appear to

4568.64 --> 4572.4800000000005
a group

4570.56 --> 4574.64
manifests like

4572.48 --> 4576.4
visions and they show themselves in

4574.64 --> 4577.76
their forms

4576.4 --> 4580.0
and then it's like yeah you're the

4577.76 --> 4583.04
special voice

4580.0 --> 4586.0
we are your gods and we're the only gods

4583.04 --> 4588.159
right like that or maybe not even that

4586.0 --> 4590.8
just saying like we're the ones and then

4588.159 --> 4593.28
they go to another region and then they

4590.8 --> 4595.28
show up in a slightly different form but

4593.28 --> 4597.599999999999
very reminiscent the powers are the

4595.28 --> 4599.36
powers that they have

4597.6 --> 4602.159000000001
and they just do the same thing in a

4599.36 --> 4604.32
different way and they like adapt

4602.159 --> 4606.5599999999995
directly to everything

4604.32 --> 4608.08
that those people typically have as

4606.56 --> 4609.64
traits

4608.08 --> 4612.32
so that they would completely

4609.64 --> 4615.679
metamorphize themselves in order to

4612.32 --> 4618.4
change into those specific gods to those

4615.679 --> 4618.4
groups of people

4619.44 --> 4625.199
and

4620.84 --> 4626.719
maybe maybe that entire process

4625.199 --> 4630.0
could be

4626.719 --> 4632.159
summarized symbolically in zeus

4630.0 --> 4634.64
approaching

4632.159 --> 4636.879999999999
women and mating with them like making

4634.64 --> 4638.56
that connection maybe that is what that

4636.88 --> 4641.679
entire thing was that the gods

4638.56 --> 4641.679
approaching man

4643.04 --> 4646.64
connecting with them making these

4644.88 --> 4650.0
religions

4646.64 --> 4652.2390000000005
was basically zeus impregnating man

4650.0 --> 4655.52
maybe that is what that entire thing

4652.239 --> 4655.5199999999995
symbolically stands for

4656.8 --> 4659.8
do

4664.56 --> 4669.52
or you could just talk about something

4666.64 --> 4672.2390000000005
completely different that has absolutely

4669.52 --> 4674.2390000000005
nothing to do with it i mean it's only

4672.239 --> 4676.959999999999
like one of the most important

4674.239 --> 4678.799999999999
realizations i've ever had

4676.96 --> 4681.44
you know

4678.8 --> 4685.76
that's all

4681.44 --> 4685.759999999999
i mean why don't you talk about 911

4688.64 --> 4691.76
oh sorry that's not what you were

4690.0 --> 4694.48
talking about

4691.76 --> 4694.4800000000005
what the [ __ ]

4694.64 --> 4700.159000000001
okay i totally read that wrong

4697.679 --> 4701.92
kevlar

4700.159 --> 4705.5199999999995
what the hell

4701.92 --> 4709.2390000000005
revelations 9 11 that is weird

4705.52 --> 4709.2390000000005
so what does it say

4722.02 --> 4725.879000000001
[Music]

4731.6 --> 4735.84
apollo leon that's interesting

4738.08 --> 4742.64
but you know what you know what godzilla

4744.0 --> 4746.32
maybe

4747.76 --> 4755.04
keep in mind if you even hurt me huh

4751.6 --> 4757.04
just a few minutes ago keep in mind

4755.04 --> 4760.719
maybe the gods

4757.04 --> 4761.44
appeared to the jews

4760.719 --> 4762.4
in

4761.44 --> 4763.678999999999
their

4762.4 --> 4764.639999999999
form

4763.679 --> 4768.88
maybe

4764.64 --> 4770.64
them being like fallen dark angels

4768.88 --> 4773.1990000000005
were the gods

4770.64 --> 4775.280000000001
that they sought out

4773.199 --> 4778.639999999999
for the jews

4775.28 --> 4778.639999999999
to see them as

4783.12 --> 4787.12
right what i'm basically saying right

4785.199 --> 4791.28
now about it

4787.12 --> 4794.159
a good comparison would be the great

4791.28 --> 4796.4
revelation moment of

4794.159 --> 4796.4
uh

4796.8 --> 4800.88
ambassador kosh

4798.96 --> 4804.2390000000005
in babylon 5

4800.88 --> 4806.159000000001
where he gets out of his suit to save

4804.239 --> 4812.239
the commander

4806.159 --> 4813.679
and then everybody sees him as their god

4812.239 --> 4817.36
yeah

4813.679 --> 4819.52
consider that these actual entities the

4817.36 --> 4823.04
sons of god that have roamed the earth

4819.52 --> 4826.639
became the pantheons had a unique way of

4823.04 --> 4828.96
being seen by every people and the jews

4826.639 --> 4830.32
the hebrew people

4828.96 --> 4833.84
saw them

4830.32 --> 4833.84
like that

4836.159 --> 4840.879999999999
does that mean they're evil well they

4838.88 --> 4843.4400000000005
might be considered as evil from the

4840.88 --> 4844.4800000000005
perspective of the hebrew

4843.44 --> 4847.5199999999995
you know

4844.48 --> 4850.159
that doesn't mean that they are that

4847.52 --> 4852.2390000000005
it's just that they were tinker tailored

4850.159 --> 4854.48
in their image that they represented to

4852.239 --> 4856.5599999999995
the hebrew like that

4854.48 --> 4858.959999999999
and probably for a reason because they

4856.56 --> 4861.76
did it with everybody in unique way with

4858.96 --> 4864.32
every

4861.76 --> 4866.400000000001
like religious population yeah we have

4864.32 --> 4870.08
become religious population group like

4866.4 --> 4873.199
they've created it

4870.08 --> 4874.96
they created

4873.199 --> 4877.839999999999
the way

4874.96 --> 4877.84
they uh

4885.76 --> 4892.159000000001
i mean it's not too far off in my

4889.04 --> 4894.239
opinion to say that this supposed

4892.159 --> 4896.879999999999
according to hebrew cosmology fallen

4894.239 --> 4898.638999999999
angels the sons of god

4896.88 --> 4900.88
that they actually

4898.639 --> 4905.36
created

4900.88 --> 4909.4400000000005
all the religions

4905.36 --> 4910.5599999999995
they themselves showed up manifested and

4909.44 --> 4914.159
then

4910.56 --> 4916.639
laid down their religion

4914.159 --> 4919.839999999999
they they showed it by example and the

4916.639 --> 4922.0
people followed their methods exactly as

4919.84 --> 4925.0
they presented themselves to those

4922.0 --> 4925.0
people

4935.1 --> 4942.740000000001
[Music]

4959.36 --> 4964.799999999999
ah that's a very good way to say that

4961.679 --> 4964.8
getting wisdom thank you

4967.04 --> 4972.32
i agree

4968.56 --> 4975.679
we as humanity containing both

4972.32 --> 4978.639
we fall where we fall on that graph our

4975.679 --> 4982.0
unique cross to bear and to learn

4978.639 --> 4984.4800000000005
to control over the fixed little g's

4982.0 --> 4988.719
ego or worldly

4984.48 --> 4988.718999999999
get your [ __ ] together absolutely

4992.8 --> 4997.04
do i think gods are real

4999.84 --> 5004.08
historically i think that they are

5004.48 --> 5010.879999999999
now what does that mean though because

5007.84 --> 5013.28
if that is a typical anti-flat earther

5010.88 --> 5016.0
numpty [ __ ] question

5013.28 --> 5019.84
or an atheist numpty [ __ ] which is

5016.0 --> 5023.199
technically even worse in my opinion

5019.84 --> 5024.2390000000005
then you are trying

5023.199 --> 5028.799999999999
to

5024.239 --> 5031.12
put a straw man of course like like a

5028.8 --> 5034.08
flat earth model

5031.12 --> 5036.88
which isn't our flat earth model that's

5034.08 --> 5037.92
just the straw man that you want it to

5036.88 --> 5040.0
be

5037.92 --> 5042.159
to straw man us with i think that you're

5040.0 --> 5043.52
doing the same thing right now with that

5042.159 --> 5046.879999999999
question

5043.52 --> 5051.280000000001
globe berry pie

5046.88 --> 5055.52
you don't even know what it is any of it

5051.28 --> 5055.5199999999995
i've been analyzing quite a lot here

5055.679 --> 5059.1990000000005
no nothing to i know it has nothing to

5057.679 --> 5063.28
do with flat earth

5059.199 --> 5063.28
but it is extremely similar

5068.84 --> 5073.84
though like why else would you even ask

5071.92 --> 5076.159
such a question

5073.84 --> 5077.52
if you're not trying to set some kind of

5076.159 --> 5081.28
a trap

5077.52 --> 5084.52
like why would you ask such a question

5081.28 --> 5084.5199999999995
like that

5101.199 --> 5104.32
you never thought of that before flatter

5102.88 --> 5106.0
sage huh

5104.32 --> 5106.96
all right

5106.0 --> 5109.199
well

5106.96 --> 5112.44
i'm glad i helped you

5109.199 --> 5112.44
see that

5119.04 --> 5124.56
the god stories are real

5122.159 --> 5128.719
i think that they're based on real

5124.56 --> 5130.719
real sightings and real visions

5128.719 --> 5134.4
and real

5130.719 --> 5136.56
physical in-world events yeah

5134.4 --> 5138.08
in that sense they're real but just like

5136.56 --> 5142.639
i think that the bible has been

5138.08 --> 5146.719
rewritten around a real original figure

5142.639 --> 5149.92
named jesus or whatever yahushua

5146.719 --> 5151.679
who was actually a ginger noble figure

5149.92 --> 5154.159
that was going to inherit the roman

5151.679 --> 5155.679
empire and they took care of him and i

5154.159 --> 5158.32
think that the entire

5155.679 --> 5160.0
story was like adopted by the

5158.32 --> 5162.5599999999995
the hebrew

5160.0 --> 5164.639
or given to them even stolen perhaps i

5162.56 --> 5166.080000000001
don't know how it's very weird how it

5164.639 --> 5168.719
all happened but i think that the entire

5166.08 --> 5169.76
bible is completely rewritten to make

5168.719 --> 5172.639
him

5169.76 --> 5175.52
a jew i don't think he even was one not

5172.639 --> 5175.52
like that anyway

5175.679 --> 5179.4400000000005
and

5176.96 --> 5181.04
so yeah why if i think that then why

5179.44 --> 5185.199
would i think that even the greek

5181.04 --> 5187.44
mythology as it has been passed on

5185.199 --> 5191.36
is not something similar

5187.44 --> 5195.678999999999
based on real things real interactions

5191.36 --> 5198.839999999999
real sights real technology even

5195.679 --> 5200.56
real events and then

5198.84 --> 5202.4800000000005
recast

5200.56 --> 5205.1990000000005
in this case not to be

5202.48 --> 5206.799999999999
rewritten

5205.199 --> 5209.919999999999
but to be

5206.8 --> 5212.4800000000005
story told so it had to adapt in a way

5209.92 --> 5215.04
to become memorable and that's how it's

5212.48 --> 5218.159
not exactly real

5215.04 --> 5220.48
it had to be reformatted to be to retain

5218.159 --> 5224.32
memorable so that as little elements

5220.48 --> 5226.718999999999
about it would be forgotten as possible

5224.32 --> 5230.88
that's how i think

5226.719 --> 5230.88
vergo stories are real

5231.76 --> 5236.56
actual things that happened

5233.92 --> 5240.88
actual figures and amazing

5236.56 --> 5241.84
visions and technology even

5240.88 --> 5244.32
and

5241.84 --> 5246.88
i don't know fights against titans i

5244.32 --> 5250.639
think that all really happened i think

5246.88 --> 5253.84
really that happened physically

5250.639 --> 5253.84
it's just that

5254.239 --> 5258.879999999999
everything it's so long ago and it is so

5256.96 --> 5260.2390000000005
many things happened to it and power

5258.88 --> 5262.159000000001
politics have

5260.239 --> 5264.638999999999
you know over time

5262.159 --> 5266.799999999999
power politics

5264.639 --> 5270.2390000000005
rearranged things it's like a demon it

5266.8 --> 5273.28
just erases the cohesion of it to try to

5270.239 --> 5274.239
turn it into a mind control tool right

5273.28 --> 5277.92
power

5274.239 --> 5277.919999999999
of demons does that

5278.08 --> 5281.5199999999995
it

5278.84 --> 5283.6
erases knowledge

5281.52 --> 5284.96
to just try to turn people into zombies

5283.6 --> 5287.84
and take them over

5284.96 --> 5290.4
little fragment by little fragment every

5287.84 --> 5292.88
contemporary figure does it a little bit

5290.4 --> 5295.199
to their advantage and then if everybody

5292.88 --> 5297.4400000000005
keeps doing that there's a grow slow

5295.199 --> 5300.0
gradual degeneration

5297.44 --> 5300.0
to like

5300.08 --> 5306.32
total self-destruction where there is

5302.08 --> 5309.76
only demonic mind control will left

5306.32 --> 5313.92
that's how it changes over time anything

5309.76 --> 5313.92
any information that is powerful

5314.719 --> 5320.8
the demons will through people and power

5317.679 --> 5322.719
politics attempt to erase it

5320.8 --> 5324.639
yeah they do numpty dip [ __ ] get the

5322.719 --> 5327.36
[ __ ] out you're not part of this

5324.639 --> 5327.36
conversation

5333.84 --> 5338.08
no i'm not saying the jews are fallen

5336.56 --> 5340.88
angels

5338.08 --> 5340.88
borders boy

5341.04 --> 5347.679
i'm just saying that the gods presented

5343.36 --> 5351.08
themselves to the hebrew as such that's

5347.679 --> 5351.08
what i said

5371.76 --> 5375.96
take rocket let's see

5407.36 --> 5412.719
it doesn't matter what they thought

5411.04 --> 5414.639
holly b

5412.719 --> 5416.4800000000005
all that matters in the context of what

5414.639 --> 5417.84
i'm talking about

5416.48 --> 5420.959999999999
is that

5417.84 --> 5424.4800000000005
the sons of god

5420.96 --> 5425.92
that also came to earth just like adam

5424.48 --> 5428.799999999999
and eve

5425.92 --> 5432.4400000000005
presented themselves in different forms

5428.8 --> 5432.4400000000005
to different peoples

5434.08 --> 5437.679
so this is like

5435.52 --> 5440.2390000000005
pretty much much later

5437.679 --> 5440.2390000000005
i would say

5440.4 --> 5443.759999999999
than adam and eve walking out of the

5442.08 --> 5445.44
paradise i think a lot of time had

5443.76 --> 5447.1990000000005
transpired

5445.44 --> 5451.28
because there were different peoples and

5447.199 --> 5453.759999999999
they just showed up in different forms

5451.28 --> 5457.679
to resonate in a specific way with that

5453.76 --> 5459.84
people and make the religion for them to

5457.679 --> 5462.56
effectively separate them

5459.84 --> 5463.92
from their other appearances with other

5462.56 --> 5465.76
peoples

5463.92 --> 5467.12
and that these were similarities but

5465.76 --> 5469.679
over time like

5467.12 --> 5472.239
they represented themselves in a unique

5469.679 --> 5476.08
way to each people that's what i think

5472.239 --> 5478.159
and yeah if they are testable testified

5476.08 --> 5481.199
even in the bible or whatever

5478.159 --> 5484.0
to have been a paulian as you said seen

5481.199 --> 5485.919999999999
as like fallen angel

5484.0 --> 5487.12
well that's then how they presented

5485.92 --> 5488.639
themselves

5487.12 --> 5489.599999999999
to the jews

5488.639 --> 5492.75
to

5489.6 --> 5494.08
the hebrews i should say

5492.75 --> 5497.88
[Music]

5494.08 --> 5497.88
it's only logical

5500.13 --> 5505.789
[Music]

5508.03 --> 5512.459
[Music]

5514.0 --> 5518.639
yeah keflar no i'm afraid a nice plate

5516.8 --> 5522.2390000000005
of reality in the morning is not going

5518.639 --> 5525.6
to sit well on the kumu virus's stomach

5522.239 --> 5525.599999999999
have to be something lighter

5530.0 --> 5535.0
i just like

5531.44 --> 5535.0
a basic castle

5559.12 --> 5564.639
okay talking about food now you're

5561.44 --> 5564.638999999999
trying to get me hungry

5568.719 --> 5574.8
but yeah i'm very happy with the today's

5572.0 --> 5576.719
train of thinking the theme of today

5574.8 --> 5579.52
it's going to be a thing it is

5576.719 --> 5581.52
connecting up with

5579.52 --> 5585.1990000000005
my works

5581.52 --> 5587.76
with my history of the world works

5585.199 --> 5589.36
and my overall understanding of

5587.76 --> 5592.56
religions

5589.36 --> 5594.5599999999995
and why the similarities

5592.56 --> 5597.52
and what does that mean with

5594.56 --> 5600.52
christianity in the face of it and its

5597.52 --> 5600.52
convictions

5604.719 --> 5606.96
right

5607.12 --> 5611.44
i'm still going to take jesus's words

5611.76 --> 5615.1990000000005
like

5613.12 --> 5616.96
i'm not going to like take them

5615.199 --> 5620.96
like they're not worthless or something

5616.96 --> 5623.84
i'm definitely gonna still listen to him

5620.96 --> 5626.2390000000005
it's just like i'm trying to clarify the

5623.84 --> 5628.96
true interconnective

5626.239 --> 5632.0
multi-dimensional

5628.96 --> 5633.76
connections between all the information

5632.0 --> 5636.4
all of it

5633.76 --> 5638.08
the big ones

5636.4 --> 5640.239
like the mythology

5638.08 --> 5642.639
greek mythology the bible

5640.239 --> 5645.44
other mythology like norse mythology

5642.639 --> 5649.4400000000005
probably too it's it's so

5645.44 --> 5651.04
similar already in so many ways right

5649.44 --> 5652.5599999999995
it's the same pantheon but with

5651.04 --> 5656.0
different forms

5652.56 --> 5658.280000000001
but it's even the same powers

5656.0 --> 5661.12
the same internal issue the

5658.28 --> 5663.679
characteristics are different right like

5661.12 --> 5666.8
the norse pantheon are like norse they

5663.679 --> 5667.76
have norse type characteristics

5666.8 --> 5671.4400000000005
the

5667.76 --> 5672.96
greek pantheon have well i guess typical

5671.44 --> 5674.48
greek

5672.96 --> 5677.199
characteristics

5674.48 --> 5679.919999999999
very different types

5677.199 --> 5683.199
that all stands out

5679.92 --> 5687.4400000000005
why would they be the proto figures of

5683.199 --> 5692.4
that entire people of their mindset

5687.44 --> 5692.4
because they made themselves like that

5694.239 --> 5700.08
you could say they tried to rule over

5696.639 --> 5703.119
the minds of man

5700.08 --> 5705.6
tinker tailored to the region

5703.119 --> 5707.679
with everyone they just went over the

5705.6 --> 5709.04
place made visits and then formed their

5707.679 --> 5712.84
religions

5709.04 --> 5716.719
in their adapted forms to those

5712.84 --> 5719.119000000001
peoples it it like has to be like this

5716.719 --> 5722.639
it's no other way

5719.119 --> 5725.199
i can't think of a single other logical

5722.639 --> 5729.84
rollout that have let that could have

5725.199 --> 5729.839999999999
led to all this well we have now

5739.6 --> 5743.639
all right see you later jeff gassett

5763.52 --> 5767.679
are the fallen angels still around

5768.32 --> 5771.599999999999
i don't know

5769.52 --> 5772.8
i think they might have like been

5771.6 --> 5775.84
physically

5772.8 --> 5775.84
destroyed or

5776.0 --> 5781.92
imprisoned

5778.4 --> 5785.36
right there if they are still alive then

5781.92 --> 5788.08
they're not alive in this realm it seems

5785.36 --> 5789.92
or they're just not appearing maybe by

5788.08 --> 5794.84
contract

5789.92 --> 5794.84
non-intervention policy prime directive

5809.76 --> 5814.400000000001
would the watchers be the same that

5812.48 --> 5816.879999999999
depends where's the where did that

5814.4 --> 5820.96
concept come from

5816.88 --> 5820.96
what cosmology is that lifted from

5822.56 --> 5828.0
if there is a separate faction watchers

5825.84 --> 5832.4800000000005
within every religion then there is a

5828.0 --> 5835.44
chance that they are a separate being

5832.48 --> 5837.28
but if the watchers is just the title of

5835.44 --> 5838.5599999999995
like the main

5837.28 --> 5840.48
group

5838.56 --> 5842.0
in a specific

5840.48 --> 5844.32
set of people

5842.0 --> 5846.96
then they are probably not a separate

5844.32 --> 5849.759999999999
group they have to be a separate thing

5846.96 --> 5852.8
within the echoing cosmology because

5849.76 --> 5855.4400000000005
then you know they were like separate

5852.8 --> 5859.119000000001
if it's just the time like oh the gods

5855.44 --> 5860.719
are now the watchers in this group

5859.119 --> 5862.239
it's still the gods they just call

5860.719 --> 5864.32
themselves the watchers they just

5862.239 --> 5868.0
present themselves differently they have

5864.32 --> 5873.799999999999
to be a separate element that resonates

5868.0 --> 5873.8
in all of it to actually be separate

5910.32 --> 5913.199
yeah

5911.199 --> 5915.36
we're glad you're appreciating an elise

5913.199 --> 5915.36
g

5915.6 --> 5920.08
why is it always that when the most

5917.84 --> 5922.84
intense

5920.08 --> 5926.0
realization and spiritual heaviness is

5922.84 --> 5928.32
presented every like half people just

5926.0 --> 5930.639
start to act like little children just

5928.32 --> 5933.199
goofing around like they're five again

5930.639 --> 5937.04
it always happens and it's like not even

5933.199 --> 5939.759999999999
blaming you because i did that

5937.04 --> 5941.6
when it was presented to me such things

5939.76 --> 5943.119000000001
i would always be like oh getting so

5941.6 --> 5945.119000000001
impulsive oh i feel like a little kid

5943.119 --> 5946.5599999999995
again oh it's so much fun

5945.119 --> 5949.119
it's like oh

5946.56 --> 5952.4800000000005
yeah you just became a tiny little kid

5949.119 --> 5955.28
again just to have enough fun in order

5952.48 --> 5958.5599999999995
to be distracted and not attain that

5955.28 --> 5960.639
high level of information

5958.56 --> 5961.4400000000005
is that what's going on

5960.639 --> 5963.6
because

5961.44 --> 5966.879999999999
i totally get that

5963.6 --> 5969.4400000000005
i used to have that a lot it's like oh

5966.88 --> 5971.36
this information is too much it's not

5969.44 --> 5974.08
like i can't handle it it's just that it

5971.36 --> 5975.92
is too much it would disrupt my cohesion

5974.08 --> 5978.32
my character

5975.92 --> 5980.639
doesn't have enough room to assimilate

5978.32 --> 5983.04
this information so i am going to

5980.639 --> 5984.719
suddenly have so much fun

5983.04 --> 5987.44
that i'm not going to pay attention to

5984.719 --> 5990.4800000000005
it anymore like pure

5987.44 --> 5992.0
psychological instinctive defenses

5990.48 --> 5995.839999999999
is that what's going on here is that why

5992.0 --> 5995.84
you're talking about beaver nuggets

5996.0 --> 6002.239
and about ontario toasts

5999.679 --> 6002.2390000000005
is that it

6005.679 --> 6011.6
yeah the joker distracts because they

6009.44 --> 6013.759999999999
need to because the people that are

6011.6 --> 6015.92
recipient to the information can't

6013.76 --> 6018.400000000001
handle it

6015.92 --> 6021.1990000000005
it's loki saving their asses with a

6018.4 --> 6024.5599999999995
stupid little magician chick trick so

6021.199 --> 6028.0
they don't blind themselves

6024.56 --> 6030.320000000001
as freaking odin is just beaming energy

6028.0 --> 6032.639
of important information

6030.32 --> 6034.639
right at them

6032.639 --> 6036.639
loki's just like oh don't don't worry

6034.639 --> 6038.719
it's blinding yes you're gonna probably

6036.639 --> 6041.76
burn up so just look at this look at

6038.719 --> 6043.44
this oh it's so funny don't worry

6041.76 --> 6047.0
huh

6043.44 --> 6047.0
is that what's happening

6054.88 --> 6058.8
yes oh complain about it you're just

6057.44 --> 6061.599999999999
having fun

6058.8 --> 6064.8
right it's not like you're getting super

6061.6 --> 6067.4400000000005
heavy esoteric information

6064.8 --> 6069.92
very seriously no come to visit the

6067.44 --> 6072.08
oracle so what do you do

6069.92 --> 6074.159
you goof around like a little kid of

6072.08 --> 6076.8
course why would you actually get

6074.159 --> 6079.839999999999
serious i mean it's the oracle it's not

6076.8 --> 6081.6
like your neighbor

6079.84 --> 6082.719
that doesn't really know anything then

6081.6 --> 6084.159000000001
you're not going to feel like that

6082.719 --> 6086.08
you're actually going to try to have a

6084.159 --> 6088.159
regular conversation because you don't

6086.08 --> 6089.92
have all that expectance you're not

6088.159 --> 6092.159
going to be overwhelmed

6089.92 --> 6094.159
so then why would you suddenly act like

6092.159 --> 6096.0
a little kid being super distracted

6094.159 --> 6098.239
right

6096.0 --> 6103.0
right

6098.239 --> 6103.0
yeah oracle with an a

6110.54 --> 6113.569
[Music]

6113.92 --> 6118.719
i mean how many times do i have to say

6115.679 --> 6123.119
it already i've been saying it for years

6118.719 --> 6124.4800000000005
on the freaking early bird show oracle

6123.119 --> 6127.96
i'm one

6124.48 --> 6127.959999999999
i do that

6133.48 --> 6138.459
[Music]

6143.04 --> 6148.239
watch yours

6145.36 --> 6151.839999999999
okay so the watchers waters boy are you

6148.239 --> 6153.678999999999
saying that it is specifically from

6151.84 --> 6156.679
the bible cosmology

6153.679 --> 6156.679
okay

6162.159 --> 6167.839999999999
so the watchers are basically

6165.119 --> 6170.5599999999995
yeah the fallen angels then it's just

6167.84 --> 6170.56
another word

6171.199 --> 6176.08
right and even all those titles like why

6173.6 --> 6177.52
would fallen angels be be getting all

6176.08 --> 6180.159
those titles

6177.52 --> 6181.6
isn't that basically more like a godly

6180.159 --> 6184.719
thing

6181.6 --> 6186.0
so i just wonder sometimes whether the

6184.719 --> 6189.119
hebrew

6186.0 --> 6191.44
were secretly in plain sight just fallen

6189.119 --> 6194.799999999999
angel were shippers and that's why the

6191.44 --> 6196.48
deities represented themselves likes

6194.8 --> 6197.28
like that to them

6196.48 --> 6198.879999999999
huh

6197.28 --> 6200.639
oh oh

6198.88 --> 6202.400000000001
i said it oh

6200.639 --> 6205.400000000001
i'm a naughty boy

6202.4 --> 6205.4
yes

6208.4 --> 6211.759999999999
different books okay

6213.28 --> 6217.84
well that would have been great to know

6215.119 --> 6218.929999999999
when borders boys had it

6217.84 --> 6221.679
didn't

6218.93 --> 6224.96
[Music]

6221.679 --> 6229.8
what book is that from kevlar or borders

6224.96 --> 6229.8
boy bringing it up without telling me

6232.239 --> 6237.04
a group of fallen angels so they were

6234.239 --> 6237.04
fallen angels

6238.48 --> 6241.759999999999
all right so it's just a subcut here

6240.159 --> 6244.32
it's like oh

6241.76 --> 6245.84
fallen yeah it's just those those are

6244.32 --> 6248.48
the watchers we like to call them

6245.84 --> 6251.96
watchers they like to watch we like the

6248.48 --> 6251.959999999999
metal with [ __ ]

6262.88 --> 6266.639
enoch explains this

6269.92 --> 6277.84
oracle would know not to be so serious

6273.6 --> 6277.84
how the hell do you know akuma virus

6278.96 --> 6282.159
how would you know what an oracle is

6281.28 --> 6285.599999999999
like

6282.159 --> 6288.599999999999
do you even know what that is

6285.6 --> 6288.6
right

6290.48 --> 6296.638999999999
you know what the oracle like what that

6292.8 --> 6299.4400000000005
was like you think they weren't serious

6296.639 --> 6299.4400000000005
excuse me

6301.119 --> 6307.04
you see god is a what okay

6304.0 --> 6307.04
aguma virus

6308.159 --> 6313.759999999999
so i guess you're not a christian then

6311.36 --> 6316.4
or is that a colloquial watcher it's

6313.76 --> 6317.1990000000005
just something that god does and you're

6316.4 --> 6319.92
just

6317.199 --> 6322.638999999999
mixing up the terminology with just a

6319.92 --> 6324.08
standard description of behavior

6322.639 --> 6326.4800000000005
is that what you're doing right now

6324.08 --> 6328.719
akumavirus

6326.48 --> 6331.839999999999
so what is it

6328.719 --> 6333.6
are you saying god is a fallen angel

6331.84 --> 6334.88
because the watchers

6333.6 --> 6337.679
were

6334.88 --> 6339.92
apparently according to biblical

6337.679 --> 6342.159
texts or are you

6339.92 --> 6344.159
just saying god likes to watch stuff

6342.159 --> 6346.32
because he's outside of creation then

6344.159 --> 6349.679
i'd be like yeah

6346.32 --> 6349.679
so what are you saying akumu

6350.639 --> 6354.4800000000005
does the oracle make cookies

6354.88 --> 6361.1990000000005
well in the matrix she does yeah

6358.56 --> 6363.679
i'm not much of a cookie baker i'm like

6361.199 --> 6366.0
that oracle is like a

6363.679 --> 6368.719
a sweet tooth i am not

6366.0 --> 6372.199
i've dropped i've stopped doing that

6368.719 --> 6372.199
it's very unhealthy

6372.639 --> 6377.36
i don't bake cookies i don't eat candy

6382.0 --> 6387.6
i am especially not gonna make food and

6385.04 --> 6390.4
put it on the corner of a table

6387.6 --> 6392.8
just to be as smart as

6390.4 --> 6395.04
and predict how how somebody walking in

6392.8 --> 6397.4400000000005
is going to break them like i don't like

6395.04 --> 6401.84
the weights waste food not even to show

6397.44 --> 6401.839999999999
off my inside i just don't do that

6403.44 --> 6407.119
bacon cookies is for women

6409.52 --> 6414.320000000001
yeah i know i could you were talking

6411.679 --> 6417.36
colloquially a highly inappropriate

6414.32 --> 6420.48
moment for it though but

6417.36 --> 6422.4
you don't believe in divine intervention

6420.48 --> 6426.4
okay

6422.4 --> 6426.4
okay akuma virus

6426.88 --> 6432.400000000001
i think uh reality disagrees with you i

6429.28 --> 6435.44
think that the sons of god coming to the

6432.4 --> 6437.5199999999995
material realm from eden against the

6435.44 --> 6440.32
creator designers will and actually

6437.52 --> 6440.320000000001
doing [ __ ]

6440.639 --> 6445.36
i think that

6442.4 --> 6447.04
that kind of uh dispels that notion i

6445.36 --> 6450.5599999999995
think that

6447.04 --> 6451.6
god indirectly definitely

6450.56 --> 6453.4400000000005
well

6451.6 --> 6455.4400000000005
through his own

6453.44 --> 6460.08
creation

6455.44 --> 6460.08
does things that are out of the ordinary

6464.4 --> 6468.4
yes i am listening to myself dumpty

6466.88 --> 6470.8
[ __ ]

6468.4 --> 6473.119
what you think that you can just like

6470.8 --> 6476.159000000001
peer pressure me out of existence with

6473.119 --> 6478.5599999999995
your [ __ ] snivy comments your gamma

6476.159 --> 6480.32
[ __ ]

6478.56 --> 6484.04
what you think i'm not gonna declare

6480.32 --> 6484.04
myself an oracle

6484.239 --> 6488.799999999999
just because

6485.52 --> 6491.280000000001
you are gonna be oh that's so

6488.8 --> 6493.360000000001
well you're so stupid what you think

6491.28 --> 6495.84
that's gonna make me stop doing that you

6493.36 --> 6498.5599999999995
numpty [ __ ]

6495.84 --> 6500.4800000000005
think again

6498.56 --> 6502.719
i'm just saying it

6500.48 --> 6506.48
you're not gonna stop me

6502.719 --> 6509.04
from saying what i say and what i mean

6506.48 --> 6511.5199999999995
i don't give a [ __ ]

6509.04 --> 6514.159
even if i get a million people that are

6511.52 --> 6516.639
gonna be all outraged i don't give a

6514.159 --> 6516.638999999999
[ __ ]

6518.239 --> 6525.678999999999
i'm gonna say what i gotta say and you

6521.28 --> 6529.719
can't stop me you can't influence me

6525.679 --> 6529.719
numpty dip [ __ ] demon

6556.239 --> 6563.28
i don't think god came to earth just oh

6559.92 --> 6566.08
you mean jesus yeah i agree with you

6563.28 --> 6568.719
the creator can't

6566.08 --> 6572.8
he is outside of creation and always

6568.719 --> 6573.66
will be he does not come to earth

6572.8 --> 6576.729
ever

6573.66 --> 6576.729
[Music]

6578.32 --> 6583.04
right just like you're never

6580.719 --> 6586.0
going to be

6583.04 --> 6589.04
a figure in the computer game you play

6586.0 --> 6591.119
like you the person flashing blood is

6589.04 --> 6594.48
never going to be

6591.119 --> 6597.119
the actual figure in the game

6594.48 --> 6598.799999999999
never it's never gonna happen you are

6597.119 --> 6600.48
outside of the game that you're gonna

6598.8 --> 6602.08
play on your computer

6600.48 --> 6604.159
and it's always gonna be like that

6602.08 --> 6608.599
that's how i see god and there is

6604.159 --> 6608.598999999999
nothing that could ever change that

6610.159 --> 6615.28
does it mean that there can't be

6612.4 --> 6615.28
sons of god

6616.32 --> 6622.96
other things

6618.96 --> 6624.719
like more actually god in god's image

6622.96 --> 6626.2390000000005
like or attempts

6624.719 --> 6628.2390000000005
prototypes

6626.239 --> 6630.4
maybe early like maybe the gods

6628.239 --> 6632.718999999999
originally were early attempts for god

6630.4 --> 6635.92
to try to actually interface maybe the

6632.719 --> 6639.52
creator designer himself actually tried

6635.92 --> 6642.4
to be a little zeus and that caused him

6639.52 --> 6645.599
to make the sons of god

6642.4 --> 6648.5599999999995
which were like an attempt of himself to

6645.599 --> 6651.360000000001
become manifested in the realm and then

6648.56 --> 6656.280000000001
it just completely did not work out

6651.36 --> 6656.28
maybe that happened who is the same

6681.28 --> 6685.679
yeah kuma virus pretty much

6683.92 --> 6688.0
that's it

6685.679 --> 6690.639
i'm claiming to be a prophet

6688.0 --> 6692.48
but i'm not excluding it either

6690.639 --> 6694.56
there's rolling things out of me that

6692.48 --> 6696.638999999999
are gonna synchronize and match all

6694.56 --> 6698.56
kinds of things especially onto the

6696.639 --> 6701.36
future

6698.56 --> 6702.719
it's why i do it

6701.36 --> 6704.639
like

6702.719 --> 6705.52
i'm trying to stay ahead of the curve of

6704.639 --> 6706.88
time

6705.52 --> 6709.84
literally

6706.88 --> 6709.84
to escape it

6713.36 --> 6716.08
i yeah

6716.48 --> 6719.799999999999
it's complicated

6737.52 --> 6741.360000000001
it's yeah

6739.04 --> 6741.36
so

6742.8 --> 6747.599
find out

6744.08 --> 6748.84
you know that why do you think i i say

6747.599 --> 6752.8
ask a

6748.84 --> 6755.84
question ask a question

6752.8 --> 6759.1990000000005
the deeper more important

6755.84 --> 6759.1990000000005
the better the answer

6760.239 --> 6764.48
right

6761.599 --> 6766.639
the level of output that i can

6764.48 --> 6769.759999999999
offer you as an oracle

6766.639 --> 6771.4400000000005
is directly in balance

6769.76 --> 6775.1990000000005
with the level

6771.44 --> 6778.159
that you give with the question

6775.199 --> 6779.799999999999
the amount of power that i can utilize

6778.159 --> 6783.199
in the response is

6779.8 --> 6785.76
diametrically in balance

6783.199 --> 6788.5599999999995
with the power of the question

6785.76 --> 6790.0
if you don't understand that then yeah

6788.56 --> 6792.8
i'm sorry

6790.0 --> 6795.76
if you do understand that

6792.8 --> 6798.719
go ahead test it then

6795.76 --> 6800.96
i mean i'm only offering my services

6798.719 --> 6803.76
every single day for three and a half

6800.96 --> 6803.76
years straight

6805.52 --> 6810.320000000001
right

6807.28 --> 6812.32
it's not a random happenstance thing i'm

6810.32 --> 6815.5599999999995
doing here

6812.32 --> 6815.5599999999995
get it

6827.85 --> 6831.919000000001
[Music]

6838.8 --> 6844.0
right so you can ask me any question

6842.0 --> 6846.719
and you can get the power of all that

6844.0 --> 6850.88
answers under one condition

6846.719 --> 6853.199
that you actually take it serious

6850.88 --> 6855.52
and if you don't then you literally

6853.199 --> 6858.4
waste your own power

6855.52 --> 6861.040000000001
because of your inability to handle that

6858.4 --> 6863.36
power and your ego just makes you drop

6861.04 --> 6867.04
it getting silly

6863.36 --> 6869.04
loki loki from within

6867.04 --> 6871.5199999999995
so it's all up to you

6869.04 --> 6873.119
how serious are you going to take this

6871.52 --> 6877.159000000001
opportunity

6873.119 --> 6877.159
that is repeating nonetheless

6902.88 --> 6908.719
this does oracle have nigh omniscience

6906.48 --> 6908.718999999999
no

6909.84 --> 6913.4400000000005
but i have peak inside

6915.04 --> 6920.56
doesn't mean that i know everything it's

6917.199 --> 6923.199
just that i'm very well able to judge

6920.56 --> 6926.400000000001
what is true

6923.199 --> 6929.28
think of orac

6926.4 --> 6929.28
in lake seven

6929.36 --> 6933.36
it's a way of computing on a on a high

6932.159 --> 6934.159
level

6933.36 --> 6936.159
that

6934.159 --> 6938.799999999999
is just like no they can't be yeah

6936.159 --> 6940.799999999999
that's what people that can do it always

6938.8 --> 6945.119000000001
say

6940.8 --> 6947.4400000000005
i get orac i totally get him

6945.119 --> 6949.759999999999
i loved how they yeah

6947.44 --> 6951.5199999999995
put that thing together like as a

6949.76 --> 6953.84
science fiction concept in there and

6951.52 --> 6957.119000000001
execute it was great

6953.84 --> 6959.76
and it is almost like what i do

6957.119 --> 6960.96
it's just well not literally computer

6959.76 --> 6963.4400000000005
and

6960.96 --> 6965.44
but even orac just has like remote

6963.44 --> 6968.32
interface with information and my

6965.44 --> 6970.0
empathy is that's exactly what it feels

6968.32 --> 6972.32
like it's just like

6970.0 --> 6974.719
oh i just have to look somebody up that

6972.32 --> 6976.799999999999
knows what i need to know and then i

6974.719 --> 6978.8
don't even have to like pull it out and

6976.8 --> 6980.639
just have to let them say a couple of

6978.8 --> 6983.1990000000005
things and it could just like oh now i

6980.639 --> 6985.679
freaking know it because i just use your

6983.199 --> 6991.32
information without even asking you

6985.679 --> 6991.32
from your body from your soul thanks

7006.4 --> 7008.96
huh

7007.36 --> 7011.96
okay so you can start one never heard of

7008.96 --> 7011.96
that

7036.0 --> 7039.0
what

7050.239 --> 7057.239
oh yeah godzilla

7053.119 --> 7057.239
like what the hell was he saying

7080.48 --> 7086.159
dude

7082.159 --> 7089.159
i did not need to know that akuma virus

7086.159 --> 7089.159
gross

7102.08 --> 7105.04
you really had to

7106.159 --> 7108.48
ugh

7109.52 --> 7115.84
i really hope the bisexual is a lie

7112.56 --> 7115.84
i really hope it

7116.8 --> 7121.56
i really don't give a [ __ ] for the rest

7140.639 --> 7143.84
oh thank god

7148.15 --> 7151.379999999999
[Music]

7158.9 --> 7162.0599999999995
[Music]

7169.44 --> 7172.44
ugh

7173.0 --> 7176.18
[Music]

7186.0 --> 7190.0
i agree gaining wisdom yeah a lot of

7188.0 --> 7192.159
especially pop music it's just

7190.0 --> 7194.719
programming with a certain type of

7192.159 --> 7196.0
natural effect that they want you to sit

7194.719 --> 7197.92
in

7196.0 --> 7200.56
so instead of just letting you have

7197.92 --> 7203.119
normal social interactions and responses

7200.56 --> 7206.080000000001
to situations in a natural way they're

7203.119 --> 7207.759999999999
constantly projecting very specific type

7206.08 --> 7210.639
of scenarios

7207.76 --> 7212.56
that they want you to obsess over and

7210.639 --> 7215.4400000000005
fall in love with

7212.56 --> 7218.400000000001
to start to long for it and then seek

7215.44 --> 7220.638999999999
out that type of effect among your

7218.4 --> 7222.719
social interactions that's what pop

7220.639 --> 7225.1990000000005
music tends to do

7222.719 --> 7227.199
especially with women and even more so

7225.199 --> 7229.919999999999
with young women

7227.199 --> 7229.919999999999
it does that

7230.96 --> 7234.56
it

7232.32 --> 7236.0
it shows you

7234.56 --> 7238.56
like an icon

7236.0 --> 7240.56
through music and how you look and what

7238.56 --> 7241.84
you're talking about

7240.56 --> 7246.320000000001
what

7241.84 --> 7248.639
they want you to want they show you what

7246.32 --> 7250.4
they want you to want

7248.639 --> 7252.56
isn't that ironic

7250.4 --> 7254.719
in a way you could say that

7252.56 --> 7256.56
the pantheon

7254.719 --> 7259.679
the sons of god

7256.56 --> 7265.0
did the same thing with their entire

7259.679 --> 7265.0
being when faced with humanity

7268.0 --> 7274.08
they showed them

7270.32 --> 7274.08
what they wanted

7276.8 --> 7282.159000000001
they figured them out read their minds

7279.36 --> 7285.28
allegedly and probably had more insight

7282.159 --> 7288.08
as to like even the nature of creation

7285.28 --> 7290.639
being sons of god

7288.08 --> 7292.88
and then showed them what they wanted to

7290.639 --> 7292.88
see

7293.199 --> 7298.159
just like pop music

7296.239 --> 7301.36
now

7298.159 --> 7304.679
makes you listen to what they want you

7301.36 --> 7304.679
to be

7310.719 --> 7316.8
hey that's fine i don't need to know as

7312.96 --> 7316.8
long as you're not gay i'm i'm okay

7318.48 --> 7325.48
and because if you would be then i'd

7320.48 --> 7325.48
insist that you just don't tell me

7329.76 --> 7333.639
that never let's show

7380.96 --> 7385.92
man i think i'm gonna

7383.04 --> 7385.92
round out the show

7386.32 --> 7390.799999999999
ah man wow been going over two hours man

7388.88 --> 7392.0
i can't believe it's been that long

7390.8 --> 7394.4800000000005
already

7392.0 --> 7396.32
it's been very intense and interesting i

7394.48 --> 7397.759999999999
think it's interesting i have no idea

7396.32 --> 7398.799999999999
how many of you think this is

7397.76 --> 7402.320000000001
interesting

7398.8 --> 7404.320000000001
i'm gonna look at the chat then

7402.32 --> 7406.84
like that's like at least at least she

7404.32 --> 7408.5599999999995
seems like he really got

7406.84 --> 7410.32
it

7408.56 --> 7412.0
seeking star wars

7410.32 --> 7414.0
also got enough

7412.0 --> 7416.32
to immediately start reflecting upon

7414.0 --> 7417.27
around certain research

7416.32 --> 7420.409
gaining wisdom

7417.27 --> 7420.409000000001
[Music]

7420.56 --> 7423.92
and the rest seems to be just goofing

7422.88 --> 7426.56
around

7423.92 --> 7429.04
oh yeah flatter sage

7426.56 --> 7429.04
gets it

7432.0 --> 7437.36
all right but yeah maybe it just needs

7434.8 --> 7438.2390000000005
some time for you to let this sink in

7437.36 --> 7440.32
and

7438.239 --> 7444.4
maybe even re-watch

7440.32 --> 7444.4
it listen to me saying it again

7444.8 --> 7450.400000000001
right i re-watch my shows

7448.159 --> 7452.638999999999
when i know that i'm like

7450.4 --> 7455.04
really digging into an important subject

7452.639 --> 7457.04
that is in development which means it's

7455.04 --> 7459.76
going to be important more important in

7457.04 --> 7461.92
the future and more refined so it's even

7459.76 --> 7464.92
like on the short run worth it for me to

7461.92 --> 7464.92
rewatch

7465.52 --> 7471.76
i'm probably going to re-watch this show

7467.599 --> 7471.76
just like i rewatched yesterday's show

7475.76 --> 7481.360000000001
okay thank you for the link taking star

7478.32 --> 7481.36
wars that's interesting

7482.0 --> 7486.4
although i don't really like the title

7484.239 --> 7486.4
but

7491.52 --> 7496.320000000001
but yeah interesting nonetheless i i

7493.599 --> 7498.719
will check it out

7496.32 --> 7501.199
oh it's a that's a true scandian book

7498.719 --> 7506.159
that's awesome

7501.199 --> 7509.04
it's an actual book scan it's not like a

7506.159 --> 7511.28
like a text lifting or something

7509.04 --> 7513.84
so it's actual scanned paper that is

7511.28 --> 7513.84
pretty cool

7515.04 --> 7520.159
all right anyway but i am ah just

7517.92 --> 7523.36
download it you download it it's on

7520.159 --> 7526.159
netflix but anyway yeah have a look at

7523.36 --> 7528.079
it at kumo virus and please

7526.159 --> 7530.079
personal request think of what i've just

7528.079 --> 7533.199
been talking about

7530.079 --> 7534.799999999999
think of it look at that look at and

7533.199 --> 7537.5199999999995
realize that

7534.8 --> 7540.0
i think that this series was like they

7537.52 --> 7542.719
really made an effort to

7540.0 --> 7545.04
to get all tolkien level on it as in

7542.719 --> 7548.159
that they really tried to go by

7545.04 --> 7551.28
descriptions of the designs and

7548.159 --> 7553.199
they try to really make it as as real

7551.28 --> 7557.44
according to the storytelling tradition

7553.199 --> 7557.44
as they could it just all seems so

7557.52 --> 7560.8
non-modernized

7559.119 --> 7563.04
non-updated like

7560.8 --> 7565.52
what it was really intended to be

7563.04 --> 7568.48
originally very impressed by it i

7565.52 --> 7570.2390000000005
watched it a second time

7568.48 --> 7573.04
so think of what the things that i've

7570.239 --> 7574.638999999999
said and look at it like with a wide

7573.04 --> 7576.719
eyed scale

7574.639 --> 7578.400000000001
with spirit mechanics

7576.719 --> 7581.52
when you're gonna watch it i could move

7578.4 --> 7584.079
ours i yeah i'm asking you i recommend

7581.52 --> 7584.079000000001
it to you

7586.079 --> 7592.5599999999995
i thought that the series is very

7588.239 --> 7592.5599999999995
mind-blowing in many different ways

7592.8 --> 7599.92
also the music is freaking beautiful

7596.88 --> 7601.28
well it's not super perfect it's just

7599.92 --> 7603.599
glorious

7601.28 --> 7605.36
the only nuisance is when the freaking

7603.599 --> 7607.84
demon guy shows up and you hear his

7605.36 --> 7609.598999999999
stupid special sound effects with like

7607.84 --> 7611.76
the first three times it's pretty cool

7609.599 --> 7613.76
then it's like shut up

7611.76 --> 7616.079000000001
you're ruining the music

7613.76 --> 7618.159000000001
shut up

7616.079 --> 7619.5199999999995
that was my only objection pretty much

7618.159 --> 7621.04
in the entire

7619.52 --> 7623.280000000001
series

7621.04 --> 7623.28
uh

7628.8 --> 7634.0
but the music is great it's like

7631.679 --> 7636.079
baldur's gate 2

7634.0 --> 7639.44
style music

7636.079 --> 7642.0
like with all classical instruments old

7639.44 --> 7644.839999999999
classical it's it's beautiful i love

7642.0 --> 7648.079
that [ __ ] it's very dramatic and

7644.84 --> 7650.56
emotional and i love that style

7648.079 --> 7652.799999999999
it's great i love that series probably

7650.56 --> 7656.4400000000005
gonna watch it again at some point

7652.8 --> 7656.4400000000005
for the third time

7667.04 --> 7671.679
yeah yeah getting wisdom

7668.8 --> 7673.84
you don't like reduction this way

7671.679 --> 7677.76
seeing something so beautiful and also

7673.84 --> 7677.76
genius what do you mean reductionist

7682.079 --> 7686.159
you mean

7683.28 --> 7688.5599999999995
like a lot of zeus you would rather read

7686.159 --> 7690.799999999999
the mythology story is that what you're

7688.56 --> 7690.8
saying

7691.599 --> 7696.0
have you actually checked it out this

7693.599 --> 7697.679
series because it is they really did

7696.0 --> 7701.8
their best

7697.679 --> 7701.8
it's all very beautiful

7710.639 --> 7714.56
but yeah i still would agree though you

7713.04 --> 7716.48
know it's even like with the lord of the

7714.56 --> 7719.4400000000005
rings movie

7716.48 --> 7721.598999999999
thank god i read the book before i

7719.44 --> 7723.28
watched the movie

7721.599 --> 7725.84
but still i thought the movie was still

7723.28 --> 7727.28
like yeah that was still pretty badass

7725.84 --> 7729.360000000001
it is awesome

7727.28 --> 7732.5599999999995
i like the music

7729.36 --> 7734.799999999999
i like yeah it feels real enough

7732.56 --> 7737.52
right but it's still not going to match

7734.8 --> 7740.400000000001
up to of course reading it and then

7737.52 --> 7742.400000000001
having the ideas form in your mind

7740.4 --> 7744.32
visually that it's still not going to

7742.4 --> 7746.239
really compare right reading a book is

7744.32 --> 7749.36
just different from watching a movie no

7746.239 --> 7752.4
matter how well the movie was made

7749.36 --> 7753.759999999999
it's always gonna be different

7752.4 --> 7756.96
so if that's what you were saying

7753.76 --> 7756.96
getting wisdom then i agree

7757.84 --> 7762.719
anyhow

7759.92 --> 7764.8
i am rounding out the show now so thanks
