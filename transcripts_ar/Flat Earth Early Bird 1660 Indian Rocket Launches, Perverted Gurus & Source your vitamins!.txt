98.579 --> 104.119
anyway right

100.74 --> 104.119
whether today is

104.4 --> 107.06
weird

107.88 --> 113.579
there's almost no wind

109.979 --> 116.42
but it's also cloudy it's doesn't feel

113.579 --> 116.41999999999999
super warm

117.06 --> 119.659
weird

124.2 --> 128.81900000000002
but uh yeah everything is very green out

127.2 --> 130.979
there

128.819 --> 133.379
oh yeah and this weird thing happened

130.979 --> 135.84
really weird

133.379 --> 138.239
look at my plants

135.84 --> 141.8
and the basil plant

138.239 --> 141.8
it has a rock

141.959 --> 145.70000000000002
on it on the soil

147.12 --> 151.37900000000002
like what

148.8 --> 155.459
how the hell did that get there

151.379 --> 157.98
so yeah of course the dues that

155.459 --> 160.26
however silly it sounds there's no other

157.98 --> 162.78
logical explanation then

160.26 --> 164.959
one of the jackdaws Put a Little Rock in

162.78 --> 164.959
there

165.84 --> 171.0
I'll show you up close I mean this is

168.42 --> 172.319
not a joke this is not a trick this is

171.0 --> 175.44
real

172.319 --> 178.61999999999998
this is Jack DAW and maybe it's like a

175.44 --> 181.14
shamanic jagda or something because he

178.62 --> 184.26
likes to do things with rocks

181.14 --> 186.77999999999997
he lays them out in patterns I've seen

184.26 --> 190.39999999999998
him do it but apparently even like

186.78 --> 190.4
carries them around like this

197.519 --> 201.48000000000002
see like

205.56 --> 208.099
okay

208.2 --> 213.379
you see it

210.599 --> 213.379
it's right there

213.72 --> 217.7
which is like what what

219.239 --> 222.26
is that a rock

223.799 --> 227.78
I don't know why he did that though

245.459 --> 252.06
but that rock is not I mean he really

249.48 --> 254.28
either from up there

252.06 --> 255.959
got it or from the roof over there

254.28 --> 259.32
because that's not one of the Pebbles

255.959 --> 262.88
that was lying here on my balcony part

259.32 --> 262.88
so it's something really weird

266.699 --> 271.68
I think that jackdaw some of them might

269.639 --> 274.34000000000003
have like a fantasy gardening thing

271.68 --> 274.34000000000003
going on

275.16 --> 280.5
[Music]

277.5 --> 283.74

305.14 --> 310.68
[Music]

308.24 --> 312.54
reaching throwing birds I don't know

310.68 --> 314.16
what that what you mean with that

312.54 --> 316.58000000000004
slow-mo moon buggy

314.16 --> 316.58000000000004
anyway

323.16 --> 326.47900000000004
let's check the temperature

329.66 --> 333.3
22.

331.38 --> 335.4
right

333.3 --> 338.84000000000003
not super warm

335.4 --> 338.84
without really cool either

340.56 --> 345.06
there's still rain forecast for the

342.96 --> 347.88
weekend

345.06 --> 351.02
more so on Sunday even

347.88 --> 351.02
so yeah

358.68 --> 363.02
it's good for the plants anyway I got

361.32 --> 365.46
arugula here

363.02 --> 367.74
and the Gusto don't know if I'm gonna

365.46 --> 370.979
drink that one maybe I'll leave it again

367.74 --> 372.3
already had my ulum because I was quite

370.979 --> 374.63
hungry

372.3 --> 378.31
this morning when I got up

374.63 --> 378.31
[Music]

385.139 --> 392.53000000000003
all right so yeah yesterday still no fvd

388.979 --> 394.68
there might be fed today

392.53 --> 396.78
[Music]

394.68 --> 400.1
but I mean it's still a slim chance but

396.78 --> 400.09999999999997
Nathan basically just

400.199 --> 405.539
got new memory is putting it in his

403.02 --> 408.78
computer it might turn out to work and

405.539 --> 413.18
then he'll have do an fed might also

408.78 --> 413.17999999999995
turn out not to work so straightforward

413.639 --> 418.94
so I guess I'll hear about it soon

416.759 --> 418.94
enough

424.44 --> 429.479
baby chipmunks

426.96 --> 432.25899999999996
wow that's

429.479 --> 432.25899999999996
adorable

435.0 --> 439.58
hmm

437.4 --> 439.58
thank you

439.72 --> 446.8
[Music]

443.12 --> 450.259
small stones yeah yeah I know

446.8 --> 450.259
[Music]

454.24 --> 458.069
[Music]

458.66 --> 462.38000000000005
especially chickens

479.819 --> 485.22
it's like all the

482.46 --> 486.78999999999996
seed eating birds

485.22 --> 490.189
they'll use it

486.79 --> 490.189
[Music]

492.3 --> 496.44
anyway how are you guys doing today

494.22 --> 499.03900000000004
[Music]

496.44 --> 499.039
uh

499.08 --> 503.87899999999996
I'm still a little puzzled about

501.599 --> 506.039
yesterday

503.879 --> 509.84000000000003
was kind of weird

506.039 --> 509.84
ranting on like that

510.259 --> 515.339
about Christianity like that and it

513.0 --> 518.279
makes me feel really uncomfortable but I

515.339 --> 520.1590000000001
really I I believe I am

518.279 --> 525.5
well this fight

520.159 --> 525.5
the hot-headed nature of how I do it

527.22 --> 531.72
which yeah I mean that's it's kind of

529.62 --> 533.82
psychological why I even do it like it's

531.72 --> 534.779
because I'm so uncomfortable with it and

533.82 --> 537.12
it's like

534.779 --> 538.26
it's pretty hard to make a stand like

537.12 --> 540.0600000000001
that

538.26 --> 543.4399999999999
and so I think I'm just over

540.06 --> 543.4399999999999
compensating a little bit

544.98 --> 550.019
for the weight of it

547.86 --> 552.0
because I do really think that I'm on to

550.019 --> 556.5
something

552.0 --> 558.42
with this Bible thing the origin of it

556.5 --> 561.48
and it just

558.42 --> 563.5799999999999
other people are then the Christian guys

561.48 --> 565.26
they're just not biting and it I didn't

563.58 --> 567.0
know why because it's part of their

565.26 --> 568.8
conditioning it's like

567.0 --> 570.12
if you want to learn the riddle then you

568.8 --> 572.519
have to ignore everything that

570.12 --> 574.5600000000001
contradicts the riddle I'm just gonna

572.519 --> 575.76
kill keep call it the real that's just

574.56 --> 579.5
what I mean

575.76 --> 579.5
I'm doing because it's what it is

579.54 --> 584.0999999999999
and here's the weird thing

581.88 --> 588.2
do you like have an esoteric mind then

584.1 --> 588.2
you can listen to those types of riddles

588.36 --> 595.76
and you can figure out like wait there's

591.18 --> 595.76
there's a deeper esoteric meaning to it

595.8 --> 601.62
but that's not how people use it though

599.459 --> 603.92
when push comes to shove and that's the

601.62 --> 603.92
issue

604.5 --> 610.68
like the esoteric meaning is not the

607.98 --> 612.839
Every Man's meaning it's not for

610.68 --> 615.2399999999999
everyone not not you specifically Neil

612.839 --> 617.58
don't worry Neil I'm not I'm not gonna

615.24 --> 619.38
quit on your ass all the time about

617.58 --> 621.5600000000001
being a Christian I know you really need

619.38 --> 621.56
it

634.279 --> 640.86
but I wonder even like who's listening

637.8 --> 642.3599999999999
like who who's really like with me on

640.86 --> 645.12
that sort of thing

642.36 --> 646.74
feel sometimes like I'm just yelling at

645.12 --> 649.5
the air

646.74 --> 652.2
although Adam is there but I mean I

649.5 --> 654.899
don't even know if Adam actually

652.2 --> 657.4200000000001
he probably thinks that just the way I

654.899 --> 661.62
am with it getting angry that it's

657.42 --> 661.62
probably not very effective

663.24 --> 667.519
but maybe maybe I'm wrong I don't know

669.72 --> 673.86
sometimes I just don't know why I get

672.12 --> 677.72
that angry

673.86 --> 680.83
why I can't just be calm about it

677.72 --> 680.83
[Music]

687.8 --> 693.4799999999999
the rest of the day was pretty

690.72 --> 696.24
calm though here

693.48 --> 698.1
I mean once the roommates go knocking on

696.24 --> 700.5600000000001
the door because I'm that loud usually

698.1 --> 703.22
that like immediately just shuts me up

700.56 --> 704.76
because that's what I promised to them

703.22 --> 707.279
[Music]

704.76 --> 710.22
like when I get that loud I don't really

707.279 --> 714.019
realize that it's happening like I

710.22 --> 714.019
forget my surroundings when I do that

716.7 --> 722.36
and then if somebody goes knocking I

718.74 --> 722.36
just immediately snap out of it

722.88 --> 731.18
so yeah I mean yesterday I did not yell

727.26 --> 731.18
after that happened did I

732.06 --> 734.7199999999999
oh

741.48 --> 744.83
[Music]

747.38 --> 754.32
right also yeah I noticed late in night

751.14 --> 755.88
on refracted philosophy Mark Sergeant

754.32 --> 759.1800000000001
got on there that was that was

755.88 --> 761.22
unexpected and kind of fun

759.18 --> 765.5
it looked like it was doing pretty well

761.22 --> 765.5
look looked kind of healthy

771.35 --> 774.7
[Music]

787.62 --> 793.38
and he was also yeah talking about the

790.2 --> 796.0790000000001
Flat Earth Community as he does just

793.38 --> 797.639
but he's always he's done that from very

796.079 --> 799.26
start I always found that very

797.639 --> 802.94
interesting when he does that I like

799.26 --> 802.9399999999999
Mark's analysis

804.6 --> 810.48
it's a bit of a more simple approach

807.12 --> 813.12
than how I typically do it

810.48 --> 814.74
but I mean he's been doing it for quite

813.12 --> 815.639
a while so it's interesting to just keep

814.74 --> 819.3
track

815.639 --> 823.0790000000001
how we see these things anyway

819.3 --> 825.8389999999999
I think he talked about my show

823.079 --> 828.12
and like I think

825.839 --> 829.9200000000001
he might have actually seen my show

828.12 --> 831.6
yesterday and thought that I was just

829.92 --> 833.8199999999999
trolling but I'm not sure if he was

831.6 --> 837.1800000000001
actually talking about me but

833.82 --> 839.1600000000001
you did mention that as I was in chat

837.18 --> 842.6389999999999
kind of active

839.16 --> 844.86
so it just made me think I don't know

842.639 --> 847.32
get so little feedback so little people

844.86 --> 849.1800000000001
tell me anything about what they think

847.32 --> 851.22
about what I do

849.18 --> 853.019
when I do that people just kind of let

851.22 --> 855.4200000000001
it happen and then just pretend like

853.019 --> 857.72
nothing ever happened which is a bad

855.42 --> 857.7199999999999
sign

863.76 --> 866.54
to me

872.82 --> 876.9590000000001
what do you guys think maybe we're just

875.22 --> 880.279
gonna ask you straight what do you think

876.959 --> 880.279
you think I'm going too far

880.86 --> 888.5
you think I'm letting it

883.5 --> 888.5
things about myself bewilder too much

892.56 --> 898.26
Mr oh okay Richard G

895.44 --> 900.98
yeah your excuse then

898.26 --> 900.98
uh

902.24 --> 905.399
also just

904.26 --> 907.079
p

905.399 --> 910.68
it's like this

907.079 --> 913.1389999999999
these half trolls are just trying to

910.68 --> 915.54
invade my chat it happened yesterday

913.139 --> 918.0600000000001
because it happened before that like

915.54 --> 920.04
full-on trolls try to get in and like no

918.06 --> 922.1389999999999
we want to be part of your chat and I'm

920.04 --> 923.8199999999999
like no I don't want you to be part of

922.139 --> 925.98
my chat

923.82 --> 927.5400000000001
and yesterday that kind of seemed to

925.98 --> 929.82
happen a bit too

927.54 --> 933.36
but they were behaving a little softer

929.82 --> 935.639
but it was still gamma and [ __ ]

933.36 --> 938.04
it's just why the [ __ ] do they always

935.639 --> 939.82
feel the need to try to maneuver in my

938.04 --> 945.6089999999999
chat

939.82 --> 945.609
[Music]

946.86 --> 954.0
like they can't make me accept their

951.779 --> 955.74
frequency they can't make me do it it's

954.0 --> 958.32
not gonna happen you can't just get in

955.74 --> 961.639
there and then expect me to get used to

958.32 --> 961.639
that type of behavior

961.74 --> 968.399
that's not even Behavior it's

964.98 --> 970.9200000000001
it's composure it's just what how they

968.399 --> 973.38
do their frequency

970.92 --> 975.4799999999999
how they do things

973.38 --> 979.079
like what's happening on the inside the

975.48 --> 981.62
pattern of their internal Energies

979.079 --> 981.62
like

982.38 --> 986.72
it's just I notice it's not gonna go

984.66 --> 990.42
away unless they can literally

986.72 --> 992.6
extinguish it by being in my presence or

990.42 --> 992.5999999999999
something

994.26 --> 999.18
but with these soft trolls and all that

997.259 --> 1001.399
it just doesn't really seem to work I

999.18 --> 1002.54
mean Moxie is one of the few people

1001.399 --> 1005.66
that's

1002.54 --> 1008.959
as a half troll actually kind of came

1005.66 --> 1010.16
out sort of okay wouldn't you guys agree

1008.959 --> 1013.579
that

1010.16 --> 1016.3389999999999
Moxie is not terrible to have around

1013.579 --> 1020.4799999999999
kind of like a kumu virus

1016.339 --> 1022.82
so unless you trigger them by raving

1020.48 --> 1024.679
about a specific Flat Earth thing or

1022.82 --> 1028.66
something

1024.679 --> 1028.66
they're pretty decent to have around

1043.339 --> 1045.819
what

1047.319 --> 1052.8799999999999
don't do that Moxie by the way don't

1049.88 --> 1055.1200000000001
don't use a heart emoji cons that's just

1052.88 --> 1055.1200000000001
gay

1057.14 --> 1061.0590000000002

1072.64 --> 1077.2990000000002
oh wait you're talking about the

1074.66 --> 1078.98
Chipmunks right I thought four months

1077.299 --> 1082.48
you're actually talking about something

1078.98 --> 1082.48
that I was talking about but

1084.14 --> 1089.0200000000002
just my live show you know

1095.9 --> 1102.679
looking for reactions fishing

1099.86 --> 1105.2199999999998
could yeah could be effectively it seems

1102.679 --> 1105.22
what they do

1114.32 --> 1119.4189999999999
well I find it very annoying because a

1117.02 --> 1122.4189999999999
lot of the time I'm really just kind of

1119.419 --> 1124.64
trying to look for peaceful ground like

1122.419 --> 1128.48
I wanna

1124.64 --> 1130.94
be able to like just

1128.48 --> 1133.84
have have a good time

1130.94 --> 1136.76
with myself despite all the crazy [ __ ]

1133.84 --> 1140.799
that's continually getting

1136.76 --> 1140.799
that's continually happening everywhere

1140.96 --> 1146.299
with situations and people responding to

1144.14 --> 1149.6200000000001
situations and it's like it's just

1146.299 --> 1149.62
getting worse and worse guys

1150.1 --> 1154.6999999999998
I wonder if people notice because they

1152.72 --> 1157.88
do get used to that you know you get

1154.7 --> 1160.039
used to the chase the thrill of the

1157.88 --> 1162.38
chase on the internet

1160.039 --> 1166.1
but people are

1162.38 --> 1169.24
all getting dragged down to being

1166.1 --> 1169.24
in a bad

1169.58 --> 1176.539
position it's like doing things that

1172.64 --> 1178.2800000000002
normal people would never engage with

1176.539 --> 1181.4
foreign

1178.28 --> 1181.3999999999999
[Music]

1185.9 --> 1191.96
it's an alteration of the

1189.74 --> 1193.64
social balance

1191.96 --> 1195.559
I think that describes it pretty well

1193.64 --> 1198.98
it's attrition of the social balance

1195.559 --> 1202.8799999999999
what's happening with people out there

1198.98 --> 1205.299
and the trolls are like really in in the

1202.88 --> 1205.2990000000002
middle of it

1208.4 --> 1213.5590000000002
like

1209.5 --> 1216.559
undecent Behavior just going too far

1213.559 --> 1216.559
harassing

1218.72 --> 1225.679
and just not not caring about any of it

1223.22 --> 1230.02
the carelessness of it all

1225.679 --> 1230.02
is is the most disturbing part to me

1231.799 --> 1235.78
hey it's Eric

1261.64 --> 1268.3400000000001
but yeah trolls are very annoying to me

1264.98 --> 1270.26
when I'm in the mood to get to know some

1268.34 --> 1271.4599999999998
new people I mean because yes they had a

1270.26 --> 1273.74
lot of

1271.46 --> 1277.1000000000001
Jewel knew people that didn't seem like

1273.74 --> 1279.98
trolls that just said hello

1277.1 --> 1283.6
I have to get to know them

1279.98 --> 1283.6
right and then I have to like

1283.82 --> 1288.559
let a bit of my guard down and it's like

1286.4 --> 1291.14
every time that happens there's also

1288.559 --> 1293.84
trolls that just try to get in

1291.14 --> 1296.0590000000002
is because they want that guard down

1293.84 --> 1297.559
vulnerable side of me or something it

1296.059 --> 1300.28
just I don't know I don't want to think

1297.559 --> 1300.28
about why

1300.98 --> 1305.44
and it's really disturbing

1307.4 --> 1310.48
that they do that

1310.88 --> 1315.0800000000002
because it makes me feel like they're

1313.159 --> 1316.7600000000002
literally trying to derail my social

1315.08 --> 1320.78
life

1316.76 --> 1322.94
which is yeah it is a lot through the

1320.78 --> 1325.94
internet that's just what it is

1322.94 --> 1328.179

1378.38 --> 1381.5200000000002
that's hilarious

1392.36 --> 1396.799
it's going to be extra tricky when it's

1394.88 --> 1399.8600000000001
look when it turns out to look a lot

1396.799 --> 1402.799
better than the United States's attempt

1399.86 --> 1404.4799999999998
uh if it will

1402.799 --> 1406.96
could also be it's going to look even

1404.48 --> 1406.96
shittier

1408.32 --> 1411.28
all right yeah

1412.299 --> 1417.22
a bit rotten

1444.5 --> 1447.1
know what it is

1448.1 --> 1453.08
early this morning I did wake up for a

1450.74 --> 1456.4
bit and was a really blue sky so I'm

1453.08 --> 1456.3999999999999
like damn it

1458.48 --> 1464.38
I wish that was still here but it looks

1461.539 --> 1464.3799999999999
like it might rain

1465.62 --> 1469.1789999999999
somewhere in the next two hours

1491.2 --> 1495.98

1493.179 --> 1499.8400000000001

1495.98 --> 1499.84
like what are they gonna send up

1501.74 --> 1506.5
we're gonna send the person up or a

1503.78 --> 1506.5
robot or

1508.82 --> 1511.6
okay

1523.76 --> 1526.84
I'm a goody

1528.98 --> 1532.72
how exciting a bunch of numbers

1543.14 --> 1545.74
okay

1546.5 --> 1551.74
wow

1548.179 --> 1551.74
that thing is Tiny

1554.299 --> 1557.86
compared to Apollo

1588.5 --> 1593.179
I mean that thing is really small is

1591.62 --> 1596.3799999999999
there really a person in there oh I

1593.179 --> 1596.38
think it's launching right now

1596.779 --> 1599.779
amazing

1602.84 --> 1609.34
wow

1605.299 --> 1609.34
and the chat's going berserk

1612.679 --> 1617.679
I can actually share that by the way

1620.539 --> 1623.539
wow

1624.159 --> 1630.44
whoa It's so real man

1628.22 --> 1633.38
I mean that thing's really going up

1630.44 --> 1635.5
there that's why it's going sideways of

1633.38 --> 1635.5
course

1636.44 --> 1639.44
amazing

1653.24 --> 1657.82
wow it's going on a very steep curve

1661.34 --> 1664.36
hope uh

1664.52 --> 1669.26
I hope it's not too steep that that

1667.039 --> 1671.96
would be kind of embarrassing it would

1669.26 --> 1675.46
actually be crashing inside

1671.96 --> 1675.46
that's not supposed to happen

1676.22 --> 1684.919
oh yes null nominal it's all nominal

1680.179 --> 1686.72
or I mean it's our normal looking good

1684.919 --> 1689.24
yes yes

1686.72 --> 1691.7
the space spin of the rocket is

1689.24 --> 1694.52
definitely flying in a curve

1691.7 --> 1696.799
and I hope the curve is not too steep or

1694.52 --> 1698.84
it will see it crashing and that would

1696.799 --> 1700.46
be very embarrassing for our space

1698.84 --> 1705.02
program

1700.46 --> 1705.02
oh look all the animation oh

1706.94 --> 1711.7
yes numeral the animation is nominal

1717.2 --> 1720.1000000000001
wow

1722.059 --> 1730.76
they couldn't even show the actual thing

1727.039 --> 1733.22
yes I think that the Detachment

1730.76 --> 1735.98
procedure went great the animation

1733.22 --> 1738.08
showed us how it went so great we

1735.98 --> 1740.3600000000001
couldn't see it for any reason I don't

1738.08 --> 1743.299
know why maybe because it's actually

1740.36 --> 1745.2199999999998
already going down in the real world

1743.299 --> 1748.46
so the animation

1745.22 --> 1751.46
does not show that

1748.46 --> 1754.22
so we unfortunately we could not

1751.46 --> 1757.96
use the real prop

1754.22 --> 1757.96
we had to use the animation

1758.0 --> 1767.44
yes oh nominal it's all nominal guys

1763.399 --> 1767.4399999999998
flight events are all nominal

1768.98 --> 1771.88
wow

1772.039 --> 1778.899
amazing

1774.919 --> 1778.8990000000001
hope you enjoyed that little review

1793.7 --> 1797.419
never really play it's not a video that

1795.74 --> 1801.88
was the live stream that's happening

1797.419 --> 1801.88
right now on the link that Tara drop

1802.039 --> 1806.12
I was live reviewing it and yes I rarely

1805.039 --> 1809.0
do that

1806.12 --> 1813.6399999999999
I mean I don't play a video and then

1809.0 --> 1813.64
review it this is happening right now

1814.64 --> 1820.3400000000001
or at least that was a previous launch

1817.58 --> 1821.9189999999999
man oh wait oh it's going now I think

1820.34 --> 1824.84
the real life

1821.919 --> 1826.88
rocket launch is happening

1824.84 --> 1830.799
yes it is oh

1826.88 --> 1830.7990000000002
it's actually nominal now

[Music]

1842.36 --> 1846.5
wow

1844.58 --> 1849.1589999999999
so I guess we're good to see the same

1846.5 --> 1849.159
thing again

1849.32 --> 1854.86
what was that previous one then was that

1851.6 --> 1854.86
a previous attempt

1856.76 --> 1862.539
how did we get to see that

1859.159 --> 1862.5390000000002
or is this a rerun

1867.98 --> 1873.98
it's the news is live

1871.64 --> 1875.659
according to this but this is this thing

1873.98 --> 1878.26
the same recording that they're now

1875.659 --> 1878.2600000000002
playing again

1879.38 --> 1884.96
yeah it's the same recording isn't it

1882.559 --> 1887.12
same cut

1884.96 --> 1891.58
it's in the loop yeah yeah okay all

1887.12 --> 1891.58
right then I'm not gonna show that again

1893.539 --> 1896.14
right

1896.899 --> 1901.0
it was fun doing a bit of a review thing

1907.76 --> 1913.34
unloop for hours an hour yeah that makes

1910.52 --> 1915.94
sense then you get most the most squirt

1913.34 --> 1915.9399999999998
out of it

1929.84 --> 1935.3899999999999
did you guys like my little

1939.74 --> 1943.36
just having some fun there

1944.24 --> 1949.0
you find my Indian voice disturbing

1957.94 --> 1963.3990000000001
oh

1959.6 --> 1963.399
No Tara I must have missed that

1963.86 --> 1967.0
when did that happen

1977.539 --> 1982.64
I saw like the interview with Tim Jin

1980.12 --> 1984.3799999999999
with Tim James

1982.64 --> 1986.74
that was like the second live stream

1984.38 --> 1986.74
yesterday

1987.86 --> 1994.84
but I did not see the underground video

1991.7 --> 1994.8400000000001
that you're talking about

2008.86 --> 2013.3799999999999
I seem a bit gloomy today I do

2024.539 --> 2030.22
intonation in the wildly random places

2028.779 --> 2032.86
yeah yeah

2030.22 --> 2035.88
I know whatever it was not bad was it

2032.86 --> 2035.8799999999999
come on

2042.76 --> 2047.62
I mean

2045.1 --> 2051.399
the way I talk that's like exactly how

2047.62 --> 2053.7999999999997
flat Arthur talks exactly like that

2051.399 --> 2056.58
and basically copying the style of him

2053.8 --> 2056.5800000000004
in this case

2059.98 --> 2062.099
thank you

2069.24 --> 2075.0
stereotyping yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock of

2071.8 --> 2075.0
course it's stereotyping

2096.22 --> 2101.56
Dr Cohen thinks malaria doesn't exist

2099.64 --> 2104.0989999999997
really

2101.56 --> 2104.099
okay

2108.099 --> 2114.579
well my brother actually went to Africa

2111.28 --> 2118.26
in his 20s or something and he did

2114.579 --> 2118.26
actually catch malaria

2119.5 --> 2126.46
so he was told

2122.14 --> 2129.5789999999997
but he also did get like vaccine [ __ ]

2126.46 --> 2131.92
which was highly risky in my opinion

2129.579 --> 2134.579
even back then it felt like are you sure

2131.92 --> 2134.579
about that

2134.92 --> 2138.48
so uh yeah I don't know

2140.5 --> 2144.54
could have a vaccines yeah

2148.78 --> 2152.88
but I don't know look I don't know

2153.16 --> 2158.8799999999997
I do know that the concept of parasites

2156.28 --> 2158.88
is real

2159.579 --> 2164.98
and malaria does have actual visuals

2162.4 --> 2168.52
right they show actual visuals it's not

2164.98 --> 2170.98
like oh here's our animation no

2168.52 --> 2174.359
they have a a thing that you can see

2170.98 --> 2174.359
under a microscope so

2174.64 --> 2178.1099999999997
but yeah

2176.98 --> 2180.94
I don't know

2178.11 --> 2184.48
[Music]

2180.94 --> 2187.66
it could also be that it's like not that

2184.48 --> 2191.5
hard to defeat for the body

2187.66 --> 2194.2799999999997
under certain circumstances so

2191.5 --> 2194.28
I don't know

2201.82 --> 2207.48
in next to IET

2204.82 --> 2207.48
okay

2208.119 --> 2214.619
but isn't it also just because of the

2211.839 --> 2214.619
Jungle or something

2219.4 --> 2224.32
terrain Theory well yeah but terrain

2221.74 --> 2227.3799999999997
Theory would still play into it I will

2224.32 --> 2229.48
always terrain theory is is basically

2227.38 --> 2231.52
very important because it gives a

2229.48 --> 2235.32
universal model

2231.52 --> 2235.32
that if something is happening

2235.72 --> 2240.04
it doesn't always have to mean the

2238.599 --> 2243.52
beginning of the end

2240.04 --> 2246.22
but if you're in this if you have that

2243.52 --> 2247.9
same thing happening but in more toxic

2246.22 --> 2251.52
circumstances

2247.9 --> 2251.52
the result will be worse

2253.42 --> 2256.54
so

2254.7 --> 2259.18
theoretically and I don't know if

2256.54 --> 2261.7599999999998
there's anything to this or there isn't

2259.18 --> 2263.3199999999997
but theoretically you could have like a

2261.76 --> 2266.619
malaria

2263.32 --> 2268.599
mosquito infestation in a place and then

2266.619 --> 2271.6600000000003
the poor people

2268.599 --> 2273.2200000000003
that have not healthy food habits

2271.66 --> 2276.0989999999997
that don't know what they're doing and

2273.22 --> 2279.2799999999997
they're eating like junk food crap

2276.099 --> 2281.079
just like that on a daily basis that

2279.28 --> 2283.0
they could like get really [ __ ] up

2281.079 --> 2284.079
from malaria while the people that he

2283.0 --> 2287.88
eat

2284.079 --> 2291.04
more decently more carefully

2287.88 --> 2294.7000000000003
organic or make their own

2291.04 --> 2297.579
that they simply don't they're not

2294.7 --> 2300.7599999999998
affected by the same thing happening

2297.579 --> 2303.94
it could be that right that is kind of

2300.76 --> 2306.94
serene terrain Theory thinking so that

2303.94 --> 2308.56
that can always be a part of of what the

2306.94 --> 2310.78
what's happening

2308.56 --> 2314.38
but

2310.78 --> 2317.619
to like say malaria does not exist is

2314.38 --> 2319.9
not from a mosquito that I'd have to see

2317.619 --> 2324.119
a little bit more than that

2319.9 --> 2324.119
than just somebody saying it

2328.24 --> 2332.2799999999997
I'm pretty sure malaria is the thing

2343.8 --> 2353.32
Dr Cohen into yeah sure

2347.91 --> 2353.3199999999997
[Music]

2355.18 --> 2363.54
right yeah but more colored parasites

2358.839 --> 2363.54
for sure yeah but malaria is a parasite

2363.76 --> 2369.6400000000003
it's a parasite that is in that special

2367.839 --> 2371.56
declutting

2369.64 --> 2373.5989999999997
saliva agent

2371.56 --> 2376.359
that the mosquitoes have that they

2373.599 --> 2381.3590000000004
inject to prevent the blood from

2376.359 --> 2381.359
clothing that's where the parasite is in

2383.859 --> 2388.47
so that's what I learned about it

2386.56 --> 2391.63
I do think it's real

2467.2 --> 2471.22
it is

2471.22 --> 2474.7
very little about it except for the

mechanism on how it's supposed to

2474.7 --> 2477.1189999999997
operate

2554.74 --> 2561.22
at that bacteria and parasite yeah but

2558.579 --> 2563.7000000000003
it all depends on their nature

2561.22 --> 2563.7
right

2566.079 --> 2568.8590000000004
I know that

2569.02 --> 2573.22
I mean there's bacteria everywhere but

2571.839 --> 2577.02
like

2573.22 --> 2577.02
I'm not afraid of bacteria

2596.98 --> 2602.46
yeah Marco yeah let's not get into that

then thanks

2618.97 --> 2622.56
[Music]

2628.72 --> 2632.5
but I mean if you're kind of worried

2630.339 --> 2634.599
about that sort of thing then just

2632.5 --> 2637.599
take Ivermectin I mean it's

2634.599 --> 2637.599
anti-parasite

2640.0 --> 2644.98
and just flush them out or maybe there's

2642.88 --> 2648.099
a better way I'm sure there is a much

2644.98 --> 2650.92
better less toxic whatever way

2648.099 --> 2652.0
to do it with a bunch of roots and herbs

2650.92 --> 2655.26
or something

2652.0 --> 2655.26
fine then do that

2656.44 --> 2661.82
I mean parasites are really only scary

if you just leave them there forever

it's freaking Hornets

yeah freaking Hornets man can be so mean

2777.22 --> 2779.819
terrible

2781.72 --> 2785.68
yeah I mean

2783.579 --> 2788.6800000000003
I've had that experience with Hornets

2785.68 --> 2790.839
too by the way not well yeah it was

2788.68 --> 2793.54
pretty bad like I've been bitten by it

2790.839 --> 2796.68
and stung and it was terrible but that

2793.54 --> 2796.68
happened like one time

2797.68 --> 2804.359
but I have lost the fear of them since I

2800.319 --> 2804.359
mean I don't let them land on me

2804.7 --> 2809.68
what

2805.96 --> 2812.2
I like I can actually use just

2809.68 --> 2815.2599999999998
like they're very sensitive creatures

2812.2 --> 2818.2
they pick up on what you're feeling like

2815.26 --> 2819.5200000000004
like the energy your magnetism you could

2818.2 --> 2821.6189999999997
say

2819.52 --> 2824.56
from whatever you're feeling and all

2821.619 --> 2827.079
that they pick up on that [ __ ]

2824.56 --> 2829.06
they're like little micro empaths but

2827.079 --> 2832.119
they're kind of psychopathic

2829.06 --> 2834.52
and if you get over excited then they

2832.119 --> 2836.319
get over excited about you it's really

2834.52 --> 2839.14
[ __ ] annoying

2836.319 --> 2841.599
and I learned how to deal with that so

2839.14 --> 2843.7
if there's like a wasp

2841.599 --> 2849.06
or something or a Hornet

2843.7 --> 2849.06
flying in then I'm just not gonna panic

2849.16 --> 2854.68
and then I can like

2851.98 --> 2856.3
get them out pretty easily

2854.68 --> 2858.5789999999997
foreign

2856.3 --> 2860.319
like if you just don't panic they stay

2858.579 --> 2864.0600000000004
calm

2860.319 --> 2864.06
and you can catch them much easier

[Music]

2875.68 --> 2880.48
now you have bunked you up oh

2881.5 --> 2885.48
okay well don't worry about it

2896.26 --> 2899.26
raspberries

2899.38 --> 2907.3
100 horses wow yeah no

2904.18 --> 2911.6189999999997
yeah but they don't it's only when they

2907.3 --> 2914.1400000000003
catch when they catch your attention

2911.619 --> 2916.42
like Hornets are not really even that

2914.14 --> 2919.1189999999997
aggressive it's only when they feel like

2916.42 --> 2921.579
you're getting involved in their Aura

2919.119 --> 2923.7400000000002
right in their energy field

2921.579 --> 2927.099
that's when they certainly like start to

2923.74 --> 2929.2799999999997
like get agitated and territorial

2927.099 --> 2929.28
foreign

2931.72 --> 2934.91
[Music]

2936.96 --> 2940.8
is a bit much though

2943.3 --> 2948.3590000000004
I'd be I'd probably be a little nervous

2948.579 --> 2951.6600000000003
if I noticed that

2960.4 --> 2965.44
right but also what matters is that

2963.94 --> 2968.98
uh

2965.44 --> 2972.2200000000003
Hornets like Hornets are like really

2968.98 --> 2974.5
[ __ ] up when they're sugar addicts

2972.22 --> 2976.839
wasps right

2974.5 --> 2978.099
so when there's like a swimming pool or

2976.839 --> 2981.52
something and

2978.099 --> 2984.2200000000003
kids like just dump their

2981.52 --> 2987.52
their food or their ice cream

2984.22 --> 2989.74
and leave it then you can get ants but

2987.52 --> 2992.56
you can also get wasps and when wasps

2989.74 --> 2997.0789999999997
get sugar addicted those are like those

2992.56 --> 2997.0789999999997
are the [ __ ] up nasty bastards

2997.42 --> 3002.839
because it's like they get drunk and

2999.22 --> 3002.839
then they just start attacking people

3004.26 --> 3009.78
or like as soon as it wears off first

3006.72 --> 3011.3999999999996
they'll just like hang around then the

3009.78 --> 3014.78
sugar or something wears off and then

3011.4 --> 3014.78
they get super aggressive

3016.68 --> 3019.2799999999997
yeah

3019.44 --> 3024.0
but I mean in the wild

3021.839 --> 3025.619
they're not usually not sugar addicts

3024.0 --> 3028.22
because there isn't sugar around to get

3025.619 --> 3028.2200000000003
addicted to

3028.26 --> 3032.119
so those are less aggressive

3062.119 --> 3066.3
they caught your Vibe yeah that's a

3064.68 --> 3067.6189999999997
pretty good way to describe it it is

3066.3 --> 3070.98
like that

3067.619 --> 3075.319
they just catch your vibe

3192.24 --> 3196.6189999999997
those people they would have subscribed

3195.059 --> 3199.92
to those people

3240.18 --> 3244.74
don't recommend Channel

3244.74 --> 3249.66
yeah that can definitely help but that's

3247.5 --> 3251.46
just in the normal recommendation list

3249.66 --> 3255.0589999999997
right that's one thing

3251.46 --> 3256.619
but YouTube would like not just do in

3255.059 --> 3261.619
things in the recommendation list but

3256.619 --> 3261.619
like force you to like go to the channel

days and then just stopped

3277.8 --> 3282.54
probably for the better

3533.28 --> 3537.8390000000004
that comment there was definitely a

3535.74 --> 3540.4399999999996
wrench deserving

3537.839 --> 3540.44
comment

3541.16 --> 3547.02
as in you are a supporter but you also

3544.559 --> 3548.099
realize that supporting Randy was a

3547.02 --> 3550.98
waste

3548.099 --> 3554.119
that that deserves a wrench

3550.98 --> 3554.119
[Music]

3565.64 --> 3571.52
2012 thing

3568.98 --> 3571.52
right

3573.0 --> 3579.0
yeah but it's like 2012 by what standard

3576.359 --> 3581.96
right by what

3579.0 --> 3581.96
by what calendar

3582.18 --> 3588.3089999999997
you see

3583.86 --> 3588.309
[Music]

3599.339 --> 3603.96
so and now you could even think like oh

3602.339 --> 3607.2
the Gregorian

3603.96 --> 3610.88
calendar was screwed with a thousand

3607.2 --> 3610.8799999999997
years have been added and it's like

3611.46 --> 3617.099
a giant thousand year Gap

3614.16 --> 3618.54
has been artificially inserted within

3617.099 --> 3622.799
our history

3618.54 --> 3628.7599999999998
so maybe 2012 still gonna happen

3622.799 --> 3628.7599999999998
in about like 900 years or so

3630.72 --> 3634.4399999999996

3845.22 --> 3848.66
a dose of turmeric

3849.72 --> 3853.52
like that that should help a lot

3854.64 --> 3860.0
just get a

3856.619 --> 3860.0
a big dose of it

3861.359 --> 3866.5789999999997
and that should like help

3863.24 --> 3869.66
restore that strain very quickly like if

3866.579 --> 3869.6600000000003
you overburden them

3874.02 --> 3879.559
oh they don't long never gets hurt yeah

to do everything all day long

3889.44 --> 3893.599
that only happens when you're very young

3895.5 --> 3902.18
it's a luxury you best

3899.22 --> 3902.18

3905.16 --> 3907.94
to achieve it

3912.18 --> 3914.18

3923.4 --> 3928.339
white willow capsules

okay oh so you're still in a recovery

3946.5 --> 3951.66
okay well Mark I really do recommend you

3949.26 --> 3955.76
try some turmeric

3951.66 --> 3955.7599999999998
you need to curcuminoid

3955.92 --> 3959.299
that could really help

3974.54 --> 3979.68
Ed

3976.64 --> 3982.859
over the egg for a week right yeah it

3979.68 --> 3986.22

3982.859 --> 3988.88
about what you're gonna be eating and

3986.22 --> 3988.8799999999997
all that

3989.099 --> 3995.46
dude I feel right now a lot better than

3993.0 --> 3998.099
I did when I was much younger like in my

3995.46 --> 4001.4
teens I did not have a good time a lot

3998.099 --> 4006.02
of the time because I ate [ __ ] not late

4001.4 --> 4009.14
Jeffy but I ate really crappy candy and

4006.02 --> 4010.94
chips and like not a little but a

4009.14 --> 4012.44
[ __ ] lot of it because it was an

4010.94 --> 4015.26
addict

4012.44 --> 4018.079
[ __ ] did it in secret even

4015.26 --> 4021.44
they hit that from others it's like oh

4018.079 --> 4024.2000000000003
my secret candy like dude it's a miracle

4021.44 --> 4027.2000000000003
I didn't turn into a chubby kid

4024.2 --> 4028.3999999999996
because of that but I did for some

4027.2 --> 4029.7799999999997
reason

4028.4 --> 4033.079
but

4029.78 --> 4036.15
it had all these kinds of side effects

4033.079 --> 4037.4
on my body and I ached a lot

4036.15 --> 4039.619
[Music]

4037.4 --> 4041.599
it's like even though I did Sports I had

4039.619 --> 4043.88
issues with that and it's really when I

4041.599 --> 4045.44
stopped doing that [ __ ]

4043.88 --> 4050.119
around

4045.44 --> 4052.4
my 20s especially 2006. it was 26 that's

4050.119 --> 4056.42
when I really like okay I'm not eating

4052.4 --> 4058.94
that no more candy all organic

4056.42 --> 4063.14
filter water just like do it serious

4058.94 --> 4066.44
because I was so sick of the aches

4063.14 --> 4069.859
like I felt older

4066.44 --> 4072.92
like being 20 then I did

4069.859 --> 4075.799
well then I do right now

4072.92 --> 4077.839
even though I do have some issues of

4075.799 --> 4079.46
like getting older but it's like pretty

4077.839 --> 4082.7
minor

4079.46 --> 4085.52
compared to not having that bird toxic

4082.7 --> 4089.0589999999997
burden all the time [ __ ] me over and

4085.52 --> 4090.92
having a severely negative influence on

4089.059 --> 4094.8190000000004
my mood

4090.92 --> 4097.96
because I used to be a lot more unstable

4094.819 --> 4097.96
because of all that

4104.66 --> 4108.5599999999995
so yeah

4105.92 --> 4110.96
he's being a teenager

4108.56 --> 4113.779
not eating healthy having candy

4110.96 --> 4116.6
addiction and [ __ ]

4113.779 --> 4120.56
and having severe self-esteem issues

4116.6 --> 4123.64
yeah not a good place to be

4120.56 --> 4123.64
in many ways

4123.859 --> 4127.759
the only good moments that I even can

4125.96 --> 4130.1
remember were the times I was like

4127.759 --> 4133.699
really able to fully

4130.1 --> 4136.58
immerse myself in some form of escapism

4133.699 --> 4139.339
like playing video games

4136.58 --> 4140.719
certain video games like Boulder's Gate

4139.339 --> 4143.7789999999995
at the time and

4140.719 --> 4147.7390000000005
like that was like a massive distraction

4143.779 --> 4152.859
that really got me out of

4147.739 --> 4152.8589999999995
this hell hole that I felt in many times

4160.04 --> 4168.759
right you're a meathead Mark's colored

4165.02 --> 4168.759
like bodybuilder type

4170.08 --> 4173.489
[Music]

4176.239 --> 4180.099999999999
yeah I never got into that

4181.279 --> 4188.259
like I just want to look good enough for

4184.64 --> 4188.259
the ladies pretty much that's it

4197.239 --> 4203.9
it's just that I want the 80s

4201.02 --> 4205.88
to have that certain type of look when

4203.9 --> 4208.12
they look at me and that's really the

4205.88 --> 4208.12
reason

4209.06 --> 4213.92
although it's kind of count for myself

4211.1 --> 4215.2390000000005
too I I want to look decent enough when

4213.92 --> 4218.42
I look in the mirror I don't want to

4215.239 --> 4221.0199999999995
look like some freak

4218.42 --> 4221.02
so

4231.86 --> 4237.159
if I just wait since you're teenagers

4234.739 --> 4237.159
huh

4239.12 --> 4244.54
well yeah I mean muscle comes and goes

4242.36 --> 4244.54
man

4249.26 --> 4254.3
and hey as a teenager you also just get

4252.32 --> 4256.4
more testosterone and if you then work

4254.3 --> 4259.360000000001
with it and you build muscles yeah it

4256.4 --> 4259.36
works a lot quicker

4261.679 --> 4268.06
when you get older it's just not there

4264.08 --> 4268.0599999999995
anymore not that much

4274.94 --> 4280.178999999999
that's true though Richard yes muscle

4277.64 --> 4280.179
memory

4286.76 --> 4294.26
well it's also like the your tendons

4289.46 --> 4296.96
right so yeah your muscle it shrinks but

4294.26 --> 4300.400000000001
your tendons

4296.96 --> 4300.4
they don't shrink

4300.44 --> 4306.62
that's how you get like the very tough

4303.26 --> 4308.84
old man syndrome older people that don't

4306.62 --> 4310.34
even look like having muscles but all

4308.84 --> 4314.06
their tendons

4310.34 --> 4317.8
are just as strong as when they had were

4314.06 --> 4321.1
huge bulked right so that part States

4317.8 --> 4321.1
that's true

4341.0 --> 4344.0
hmm

4349.52 --> 4355.2390000000005
strong old man tendency yeah yeah now

4352.46 --> 4355.2390000000005
but that's awesome

4355.58 --> 4360.32
it's a strong old man tendons is also

4358.219 --> 4363.5
the thing that

4360.32 --> 4365.599999999999
it's really the thing that keeps men men

4363.5 --> 4368.0
for even when they're old like that

4365.6 --> 4370.76
because if they would just like fall

4368.0 --> 4373.34
apart like that that would just really

4370.76 --> 4375.92
make them feel old but old men that have

4373.34 --> 4378.02
been like

4375.92 --> 4380.54
strong

4378.02 --> 4383.42
when they were younger well they can

4380.54 --> 4384.86
just keep going you see even though

4383.42 --> 4385.82
they're all they can still keep doing

4384.86 --> 4389.12
things

4385.82 --> 4390.62
it's like unless their back wears out or

4389.12 --> 4392.659
something right when that happened yeah

4390.62 --> 4395.3
the gears just grew

4392.659 --> 4397.4
but that's usually how it works

4395.3 --> 4399.679
is when you were young if you were

4397.4 --> 4401.9
strong you keep those tendons you stay

4399.679 --> 4404.4800000000005
effectively strong you don't bulk up

4401.9 --> 4406.219
anymore as much but you're still very

4404.48 --> 4411.259999999999
tough

4406.219 --> 4413.3
so unless your flexibility collapses

4411.26 --> 4414.4800000000005
which typically happens through back

4413.3 --> 4416.3
issues

4414.48 --> 4418.879999999999
[Music]

4416.3 --> 4421.76
or arthritis but that's that's very

4418.88 --> 4425.12
terrible when you get that

4421.76 --> 4428.06
so unless your flexibility gives in you

4425.12 --> 4429.32
can like stay very vital at a very old

4428.06 --> 4432.76
age

4429.32 --> 4432.759999999999
it's a it's quite a gift

4435.04 --> 4439.94
because I mean it's very useful for a

4438.02 --> 4443.3
man to have that

4439.94 --> 4445.639999999999
capability right they stay capable that

4443.3 --> 4449.84
keeps you go it's very motivating

4445.64 --> 4452.179
and it enables you to keep busy

4449.84 --> 4454.52
while feeling useful and that is really

4452.179 --> 4456.26
a very important factor in staying alive

4454.52 --> 4459.38
when you get older is that you don't

4456.26 --> 4462.9400000000005
feel completely superfluous

4459.38 --> 4462.9400000000005
that you don't feel useless

4463.159 --> 4468.259999999999
because

4464.54 --> 4471.04
feeling useless and Superfluous kills

4468.26 --> 4471.04
you when you're old

4492.76 --> 4499.76
and it's kind of funny too because

4496.04 --> 4503.12
when you just in general right at least

4499.76 --> 4505.88
this has been my experience is that

4503.12 --> 4508.4
all people when they don't have like

4505.88 --> 4510.62
physique problems they're like actually

4508.4 --> 4513.5
really eager to help with things

4510.62 --> 4515.54
physically a lot of the time

4513.5 --> 4516.8
especially when you compare them to

4515.54 --> 4520.9
young people

4516.8 --> 4523.88
who are a lot of the time lazy as [ __ ]

4520.9 --> 4526.4
but all people when they're still

4523.88 --> 4530.32
capable of do they like are very eager

4526.4 --> 4533.839999999999
to help out and [ __ ] which is like

4530.32 --> 4535.58
impressive and I always forget about

4533.84 --> 4537.860000000001
that

4535.58 --> 4539.9
it would always surprise me about old

4537.86 --> 4542.599999999999
people when I was younger because well I

4539.9 --> 4544.82
was lazy as [ __ ] but it was really like

4542.6 --> 4546.7390000000005
just feeling like you know I don't feel

4544.82 --> 4549.739
great

4546.739 --> 4551.599999999999
if I get to the point where I'd like

4549.739 --> 4553.28
something then I would like be very

4551.6 --> 4555.320000000001
eager

4553.28 --> 4558.259999999999
to do it

4555.32 --> 4562.179
but if I felt kind of shitty then

4558.26 --> 4562.179
I've become kind of lethargic

4562.4 --> 4567.04
which uncertainly happened quite a bit

4567.5 --> 4572.0
like and that was even before I like

4569.6 --> 4575.6
started smoking cannabis so it's not

4572.0 --> 4578.96
like oh you once you hit the reefer no

4575.6 --> 4581.5
no no I had that way before the reefer

4578.96 --> 4581.5
so

4585.199 --> 4590.299999999999
there was actually in ways that agree

4588.14 --> 4592.820000000001
for smoking cannabis when I was younger

4590.3 --> 4595.04
had an influence where it made me like

4592.82 --> 4599.0599999999995
unexpectedly

4595.04 --> 4601.28
super enthusiastic about things

4599.06 --> 4602.860000000001
that's what it did for me at first it

4601.28 --> 4607.099999999999
was an unexpected

4602.86 --> 4609.0199999999995
opposite of what you'd expect reaction

4607.1 --> 4611.659000000001
and I reason out back then that's

4609.02 --> 4615.080000000001
because I have ADHD

4611.659 --> 4617.719
because like similar effects have been

4615.08 --> 4619.64
reported for people like taking Ritalin

4617.719 --> 4622.88
and all that like it's basically speed

4619.64 --> 4625.42
but if you have ADHD you become calm and

4622.88 --> 4625.42
focused

4625.88 --> 4632.36
well if you don't have ADHD you become

4628.6 --> 4634.280000000001
hyperactive and focused

4632.36 --> 4638.199
and I thought like oh maybe this

4634.28 --> 4638.199
cannabis reaction is kind of like that

4642.5 --> 4646.52
because most people that smoke cannabis

4645.08 --> 4650.9
especially when they're younger really

4646.52 --> 4654.02
influenced they get like oh I did

4650.9 --> 4656.719
any kind of zone out and like oh they

4654.02 --> 4660.26
get in the trance very easily I was just

4656.719 --> 4663.26
like like yeah yeah like felt like made

4660.26 --> 4666.6990000000005
me feel incredible and like enthusiastic

4663.26 --> 4666.6990000000005
and bouncy

4679.76 --> 4682.6
foreign

4686.84 --> 4692.179
I don't know about that

4689.08 --> 4694.9
that yeah might be

4692.179 --> 4694.9
could be

4696.38 --> 4704.06
but I mean no fap it will certainly help

4701.06 --> 4705.860000000001
improve your testosterone levels and

4704.06 --> 4707.38
testosterone is like one of the most

4705.86 --> 4710.599999999999
important

4707.38 --> 4713.179
physiological restoration

4710.6 --> 4715.159000000001
hormones

4713.179 --> 4718.04
that you can produce

4715.159 --> 4721.78
so in that sense yeah

4718.04 --> 4724.46
not squirting continually will help you

4721.78 --> 4727.179
restore your body better

4724.46 --> 4727.179
literally

4731.96 --> 4735.679
and that's probably counts even more

4733.88 --> 4737.900000000001
when you're older because your

4735.679 --> 4740.3
testosterone is going to on average

4737.9 --> 4742.96
decline

4740.3 --> 4742.96
so

4743.239 --> 4748.099999999999
if you're a dirty old man you're

4745.34 --> 4750.14
probably gonna look start to really look

4748.1 --> 4753.26
like a goblin

4750.14 --> 4756.9800000000005
if you're not dirty or you stop doing

4753.26 --> 4760.900000000001
that then you'll retain some of that

4756.98 --> 4760.9
more human shape

4761.239 --> 4766.58
because the testosterone stops your

4763.58 --> 4766.58
goblinification

4767.9 --> 4771.04
if you know what I mean

4778.159 --> 4781.839999999999
eat healthy and actually yeah of course

4788.38 --> 4793.88
that is so

4791.0 --> 4796.58
yeah flatter stage but dude I've heard

4793.88 --> 4799.52
stories all over the place of yogis just

4796.58 --> 4802.58
being incredible perverts

4799.52 --> 4807.080000000001
so that's just so typical only once a

4802.58 --> 4810.14
month like oh so you got to have it do

4807.08 --> 4813.5599999999995
you have to do it do you

4810.14 --> 4816.320000000001
that you're gonna say once a month

4813.56 --> 4818.659000000001
instead of like no just don't do it

4816.32 --> 4823.46
so they they're already like no you have

4818.659 --> 4825.92
to do it once like yeah you were perfect

4823.46 --> 4828.32
if if you're literally having a schedule

4825.92 --> 4830.42
like you're an alcoholic like you can't

4828.32 --> 4833.32
live without it so what's the minimum

4830.42 --> 4836.36
like dude you're a pervert

4833.32 --> 4838.28
and there's dude a lot of yogis

4836.36 --> 4840.08
literally like

4838.28 --> 4842.48
and this is something all over the place

4840.08 --> 4844.82
like even like with the Beatles that

4842.48 --> 4846.259999999999
happened if you heard of that story like

4844.82 --> 4849.4
they had this

4846.26 --> 4849.400000000001
Yogi or something

4849.62 --> 4854.42
and then one day like they left the yogi

4852.92 --> 4857.4800000000005
along with their girlfriends and they

4854.42 --> 4859.04
the yogi like try to have sex with all

4857.48 --> 4861.379999999999
their girlfriends

4859.04 --> 4865.1
like that sort of [ __ ] I mean that's

4861.38 --> 4868.06
apparently not uncommon

4865.1 --> 4868.06
it's kind of freaky

4877.719 --> 4883.179
yeah maybe but I wasn't talking about

4883.42 --> 4888.46
specifically Terry I'm just talking

4885.44 --> 4888.46
about yogis

4888.8 --> 4892.900000000001
I don't know why the [ __ ] they do that

4893.78 --> 4898.88
it's like oh a reliable Indian men with

4897.14 --> 4901.64
her old man and

4898.88 --> 4904.159000000001
she looks very very simple and then they

4901.64 --> 4907.42
turn out to be pervert like why

4904.159 --> 4907.42
why do you do that

4913.58 --> 4916.71
[Music]

4930.92 --> 4935.0
well it's yeah I probably even know why

4933.26 --> 4936.62
I mean there is such a thing as sexual

4935.0 --> 4940.48
healing and

4936.62 --> 4940.48
but it's still very [ __ ] up

4947.0 --> 4953.14
I mean yeah you yeah you're supposed to

4949.04 --> 4953.14
just keep that private

4953.6 --> 4958.570000000001
uh

4954.65 --> 4958.57
[Music]

4966.2 --> 4969.72
[Music]

4985.699 --> 4989.919999999999
there is a lot of pervert yogis

5000.64 --> 5003.54
apparently

5011.8 --> 5017.1990000000005
I just don't understand why they do that

5014.32 --> 5019.84
why that has to be a thing why do yogis

5017.199 --> 5022.839999999999
have to be pervert so many times

5019.84 --> 5026.56
like is that part of it is it like yeah

5022.84 --> 5029.219
they are sexual healers something this

5026.56 --> 5032.860000000001
is like are they like

5029.219 --> 5035.92
shamanic prostitutes or something

5032.86 --> 5036.65
is it that is that just what a yogi is

5035.92 --> 5037.78
or something

5036.65 --> 5041.0199999999995
[Music]

5037.78 --> 5043.36
like a shamanic prostitute

5041.02 --> 5045.6990000000005
therapist

5043.36 --> 5049.0599999999995
is that what they are

5045.699 --> 5051.159
or is it just for some reason perverts

5049.06 --> 5055.4800000000005
just become yogis

5051.159 --> 5059.879999999999
for reasons like why does that happen

5055.48 --> 5059.879999999999
is it really integral to the teaching

5065.44 --> 5071.0199999999995
are Yogi's standard sexual

5071.679 --> 5077.7390000000005
is sexuality like a part of their

5075.159 --> 5080.5199999999995
techniques and practices like is that

5077.739 --> 5080.5199999999995
per default

5081.34 --> 5086.8
or is it just that

5084.4 --> 5089.139999999999
that a lot of dirty people just turn

5086.8 --> 5091.84
into yogis because

5089.14 --> 5094.179
I don't know

5091.84 --> 5097.3
they impress people and then get away

5094.179 --> 5099.46
with just having sex with them

5097.3 --> 5101.860000000001
I I don't know why but like how does

5099.46 --> 5104.82
that work I haven't really met too many

5101.86 --> 5104.82
yogis in my life

5104.98 --> 5110.678999999999
but the ones that I did I definitely

5108.219 --> 5112.659
noticed that there was a pervert thing

5110.679 --> 5114.9400000000005
about them

5112.659 --> 5117.5199999999995
I think a yogi like tried to pick up on

5114.94 --> 5118.419999999999
my mom one time like even when I was

5117.52 --> 5121.620000000001
there

5118.42 --> 5121.62
was pretty [ __ ] up

5137.5 --> 5142.239
they've been chased for too long and

5139.9 --> 5145.379999999999
then they crave some

5142.239 --> 5145.379999999999
what's the point

5145.659 --> 5151.659
why would you then present yourself as a

5148.9 --> 5153.339999999999
yogi and then get all dirty

5151.659 --> 5155.379999999999
like that part

5153.34 --> 5156.159000000001
right I mean if you're a yogi and you're

5155.38 --> 5158.679
like

5156.159 --> 5162.4
okay I really

5158.679 --> 5163.9
I really wanna have a good night with

5162.4 --> 5167.08
somebody right and you're gonna like

5163.9 --> 5169.78
pick up them that's fine but why do it

5167.08 --> 5171.699
like you're working as a yogi you're

5169.78 --> 5175.0
doing your thing your program with a

5171.699 --> 5177.699
group of people and then you like

5175.0 --> 5182.32
turn it into group sex like what the

5177.699 --> 5185.739
[ __ ] man what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

5182.32 --> 5187.54
I mean yeah you you did stay chased and

5185.739 --> 5190.36
and you want to have a good night right

5187.54 --> 5193.36
maybe a prostitute or whatever somebody

5190.36 --> 5196.239
that just likes you I get it

5193.36 --> 5200.08
but why the [ __ ] would you do it as

5196.239 --> 5203.4
being a yogi that's just [ __ ] up

5200.08 --> 5203.4
I mean seriously

5207.94 --> 5211.0199999999995
I've seen that

5213.46 --> 5218.26
well Yogi want to be a guru well maybe

5215.98 --> 5223.739
that's what that is

5218.26 --> 5223.7390000000005
Yogi Guru I keep I I mix them up

5228.28 --> 5232.9
although what the hell is even really

5230.56 --> 5235.120000000001
the difference between a yogi and a guru

5232.9 --> 5237.82
although Guru is more like

5235.12 --> 5241.32
a social function I guess and Yogi is

5237.82 --> 5241.32
more discipline oriented

5250.06 --> 5256.77
okay

5251.26 --> 5256.77
[Music]

5257.56 --> 5261.54
those aren't real yogis

5261.82 --> 5264.599999999999
hmm

5269.5 --> 5273.12
a spiritual teacher

5273.46 --> 5279.3
well I guess that there's a lot of

5275.32 --> 5279.299999999999
[ __ ] up fake yogis out there then

5280.239 --> 5285.159
that are more like gurus pretending to

5282.82 --> 5287.199
be yogis

5285.159 --> 5289.78
they just like to talk about spiritual

5287.199 --> 5292.36
things and Oh look The westerners is so

5289.78 --> 5296.199
easy to believe because of my accent

5292.36 --> 5298.0599999999995
I sound so exotic and wise and this can

5296.199 --> 5301.36
say a couple of sentences and they're

5298.06 --> 5303.219
super impressed super impressed they'll

5301.36 --> 5305.44
take off their clothes they'll give me

5303.219 --> 5309.54
your money like

5305.44 --> 5309.54
so easy easy score

5314.08 --> 5321.22

5323.98 --> 5327.5199999999995

become

5327.52 --> 5332.56
right

5329.679 --> 5333.6
well in that sense I am more of a yogi

5332.56 --> 5338.26
then because

5333.6 --> 5342.34
I try to do that I try to be a spiritual

5338.26 --> 5346.0
leader it's not really maybe

5342.34 --> 5348.639
a spiritual developer

5346.0 --> 5351.159
that's what I could say about it

5348.639 --> 5354.42
definitely I definitely try to develop

5351.159 --> 5354.42
it myself everybody

5354.52 --> 5361.3
a new thing we could do

5357.639 --> 5363.900000000001
we could transcend all this horror that

5361.3 --> 5363.900000000001
surrounds us

5364.12 --> 5370.9
still grow through it coming out better

5368.199 --> 5373.12
and and they feel a bit like a yogi and

5370.9 --> 5376.179
there's arguments that

5373.12 --> 5379.98
that Jesus their dream Jesus was

5376.179 --> 5379.9800000000005
actually like a yogi

5380.08 --> 5387.0
but not like an Indian Yogi when he did

5383.32 --> 5387.0
go to India eventually

5387.159 --> 5389.759999999999
so

5390.07 --> 5393.17
[Music]

5393.46 --> 5399.34
but in the past like a lot of these

5395.92 --> 5403.02
Indian Yogi or Guru types I guess and

5399.34 --> 5403.02
then they turn out to be perverts

5418.239 --> 5420.839999999999

replace

5563.86 --> 5568.719
no but you could just gotta go with your

5565.659 --> 5572.5
instinct that's what I do is like if you

5568.719 --> 5573.88
feel like a fruit like like eating a

5572.5 --> 5575.679
fruit

5573.88 --> 5578.86

5654.28 --> 5659.38
they're not very effective a lot of it

5656.92 --> 5660.6990000000005
has actually been derived from chemical

5659.38 --> 5663.04
things

5660.699 --> 5663.94
and that your body doesn't even absorb

5663.04 --> 5667.1
that

fruits well

5680.62 --> 5685.9
that's not that doesn't work

5683.5 --> 5687.04
because you're gonna be more expensive

5685.9 --> 5690.699
then

5687.04 --> 5693.659
it's better to just get the fruits

5690.699 --> 5693.659
instead

5694.239 --> 5700.98
or just get a couple of key

5697.54 --> 5700.98
a couple of key things

5702.52 --> 5709.719
but personally I avoid any kind of

5706.3 --> 5713.320000000001
supplement that says like multivitamins

5709.719 --> 5717.1
it's like either a specific type

5713.32 --> 5718.299999999999
or not I just don't take it I don't take

5717.1 --> 5722.6990000000005
multi

5718.3 --> 5722.6990000000005
things it usually doesn't work

5725.8 --> 5730.659000000001
and besides from the brand that I

5727.6 --> 5732.88
typically get my supplements with it's

5730.659 --> 5734.92
really expensive the multivitamins I'm

5732.88 --> 5738.179
just not doing that

5734.92 --> 5738.179
I don't really need it

5738.88 --> 5743.9400000000005
and I barely eat fruit and I'm eating

5741.58 --> 5743.94
barely

5744.82 --> 5749.94
Jesus rent 200. what

5751.36 --> 5754.199
Jesus

5761.38 --> 5765.179
wow that is messed up Mark

5765.76 --> 5771.399
foreign

5768.02 --> 5771.399
[Music]

5795.94 --> 5801.48
wait you're you don't know you're taking

5798.219 --> 5801.4800000000005
multivitamins what

5803.62 --> 5806.76
that's weird

5811.36 --> 5815.199
yeah but if you can get them from

5813.52 --> 5816.820000000001
natural sources because you have the

5815.199 --> 5820.199
natural sources you should definitely

5816.82 --> 5820.199
choose to take those

5826.179 --> 5832.3
oh he didn't know that

5829.3 --> 5833.88
I was taking them

5832.3 --> 5837.1
right

5833.88 --> 5839.139
but yeah flutter Sage it depends on the

5837.1 --> 5842.38
brand

5839.139 --> 5845.02
I mean there there's probably

5842.38 --> 5847.0
good types of multivitamins it's just

5845.02 --> 5849.159000000001
that they're gonna turn out to be quite

5847.0 --> 5851.199
expensive because the cheap ones never

5849.159 --> 5852.82
work

5851.199 --> 5855.04
because they're usually chemically

5852.82 --> 5859.12
derived and then your body just doesn't

5855.04 --> 5860.199
absorb them properly or at all

5859.12 --> 5863.5
but

5860.199 --> 5864.879999999999
if you had a supplement and they felt

5863.5 --> 5869.639
good

5864.88 --> 5869.639
well then it might be of some use to you

5870.9 --> 5878.259999999999
yeah that's terrible

5874.179 --> 5878.26
it's a filler wow

5887.92 --> 5892.659
so yeah flower stage you just it it

5890.62 --> 5895.86
depends

5892.659 --> 5895.86
on like what brand

5898.36 --> 5904.36
and is it like a

5900.639 --> 5906.76
a powder in a pill capsule or is it one

5904.36 --> 5909.58
of those hard pills you have to chew or

5906.76 --> 5912.52
swallow whole like that because

5909.58 --> 5914.92
those usually suck

5912.52 --> 5918.3
but if they are capsules they're usually

5914.92 --> 5918.3
more plant derived

5918.34 --> 5922.96
organic liquid multivite

5921.1 --> 5926.26
okay

5922.96 --> 5928.56
in I yeah I don't know I've never tried

5926.26 --> 5928.56
that

5932.44 --> 5935.699
if they're organic

5937.36 --> 5944.259999999999
then it's probably decent enough

5940.9 --> 5946.9
if it's just organic like derived from

5944.26 --> 5949.6
organic plants and all that

5946.9 --> 5952.379999999999
then yeah then it could work out just be

5949.6 --> 5952.38
it could be great

5961.06 --> 5968.080000000001
so you had a hard pill yeah

5965.139 --> 5969.88
I I don't trust those hard pills they

5968.08 --> 5971.32
usually turn out to be just kind of

5969.88 --> 5975.96
chemical

5971.32 --> 5975.96
and the liquid sounds better I guess

5976.48 --> 5980.759999999999
if it's if it's really organic

5982.54 --> 5989.159
but look I take the supplements that

5985.3 --> 5992.26
literally tell you from which plants

5989.159 --> 5995.92
have has it been derived

5992.26 --> 5997.780000000001
because then you know it's from plants

5995.92 --> 6002.4800000000005
right that's what I look for

5997.78 --> 6002.48
specifically and so yeah the

6003.12 --> 6009.78
royal green brand right the Royal greens

6007.44 --> 6012.54
I've been taking those for for a decade

6009.78 --> 6014.759999999999
almost like they have a vitamin C that

6012.54 --> 6015.84
just says come they are from camel

6014.76 --> 6019.38
berries

6015.84 --> 6022.62
so you know this is Vitamin C from

6019.38 --> 6024.4800000000005
camelberries right it's very sourced you

6022.62 --> 6025.8
you know this is the real stuff this is

6024.48 --> 6029.04
not just the

6025.8 --> 6031.8
the chemical vitamin C

6029.04 --> 6033.719
and that works a lot better in your body

6031.8 --> 6036.42
always although the even the chemical

6033.719 --> 6038.84
vitamin C is not bad for you it still

6036.42 --> 6038.84
works

6040.44 --> 6046.86
but this one is just better

6044.1 --> 6048.54
so that's what I always look out for if

6046.86 --> 6052.08
I'm gonna take supplements of any time

6048.54 --> 6056.3
type then I make sure that they are from

6052.08 --> 6056.3
like a plant derived source

6070.139 --> 6075.1990000000005
right yeah more colored

6072.42 --> 6075.1990000000005
I know

6094.619 --> 6097.86
okay you're going to look into that well

6096.42 --> 6100.38
good

6097.86 --> 6102.719
that's good flutter Sage

6100.38 --> 6105.179
I don't want you to take crap

6102.719 --> 6107.46
you know I used to take like

6105.179 --> 6109.9800000000005
multivitamins of like a non-organic

6107.46 --> 6111.659
General red heart pills and I thought I

6109.98 --> 6114.5599999999995
was doing the right thing

6111.659 --> 6114.5599999999995
but I mean

6115.619 --> 6121.32
my body just didn't absorb those things

6119.1 --> 6123.4400000000005
it wouldn't do that it wouldn't absorb

6121.32 --> 6123.44
it

6124.8 --> 6128.88
so it just didn't make any difference at

6127.5 --> 6131.639
all

6128.88 --> 6132.96
it was basically the placebo effect that

6131.639 --> 6135.0
made me think like oh I'm taking

6132.96 --> 6136.44
something good and it's just like oh I'm

6135.0 --> 6138.84
taking something good

6136.44 --> 6141.239
that thought would literally sustain me

6138.84 --> 6144.719
more than the actual thing

6141.239 --> 6147.718999999999
right because that also is there that

6144.719 --> 6150.659
also exists don't forget about that part

6147.719 --> 6152.4
the psychosomatics is very influential

6150.659 --> 6155.699
in your well-being

6152.4 --> 6158.94
it really is or it is on mine because

6155.699 --> 6160.86
I'm an empath but it will be with

6158.94 --> 6163.94
everybody although maybe a little bit

6160.86 --> 6163.94
less than it does with me

6165.3 --> 6170.159000000001
everybody's influenced by psychosomatics

6168.3 --> 6174.619000000001
if you feel like something about it

6170.159 --> 6174.619
that's gonna then influence it and you

6184.76 --> 6191.42
what vitamin C derived from black what

6189.06 --> 6191.42
the [ __ ]

6191.94 --> 6195.44
how the hell does that work

6198.36 --> 6201.58
I've never heard of that before Mark

6200.219 --> 6205.21
caller where are you getting that from

6201.58 --> 6205.21
[Music]

6324.96 --> 6330.78
okay it's a bit of a weird title but let

6328.5 --> 6332.699
me know what you think if anybody's

6330.78 --> 6333.96
still here in the chat beside flutter

6332.699 --> 6336.36
sage and

6333.96 --> 6339.44
Moxie and more colored

6336.36 --> 6339.44
it's Terrance still here

6343.679 --> 6350.04
right so I called the show Indian rocket

6346.199 --> 6352.08
launches perverted gurus and Source your

6350.04 --> 6355.8
vitamins

6352.08 --> 6357.78
it's a little bit erratic

6355.8 --> 6360.320000000001
but it is technically what we've been

6357.78 --> 6360.32
talking about

6364.86 --> 6370.139
it is what I was told

6367.32 --> 6372.619
that's a very very strange story Mark

6370.139 --> 6372.619
alert

6380.04 --> 6385.98
you like my titles thanks I do my best

6383.1 --> 6388.159000000001
for them I mean

6385.98 --> 6388.159
foreign

6390.32 --> 6399.139
for like a thousand times eventually you

6394.44 --> 6399.138999999999
get good at it you you find a system

6399.88 --> 6404.869
[Music]

6408.33 --> 6412.33
[Music]

6423.36 --> 6432.08
a mutant string

6425.88 --> 6432.08
the aspergillus [ __ ] oh [ __ ] okay

6437.04 --> 6440.4
that that kind of looks like the

6439.139 --> 6444.38
asparagus

6440.4 --> 6444.379999999999
N word if you know what I mean

6444.6 --> 6449.119000000001
that's a very weird

6447.84 --> 6453.78
thing

6449.119 --> 6457.44
but okay I guess that they use a weird

6453.78 --> 6462.139
modified fungus

6457.44 --> 6462.138999999999
to create yeah to ferment

6463.619 --> 6466.88
the citric acid

6468.0 --> 6471.44
that's really weird

6471.9 --> 6477.48
I didn't know that so I guess they have

6475.02 --> 6480.6
like Advanced the

6477.48 --> 6482.58
the originally chemical citric acid

6480.6 --> 6486.619000000001
right because that's chemical citric

6482.58 --> 6486.619
acid is a chemical is chemically made

6487.5 --> 6492.56
so they found a way to advance it I

6490.38 --> 6492.56
guess

6508.44 --> 6514.04
well how incredibly bizarre I had no

6511.679 --> 6514.04
idea

6515.46 --> 6521.6
and ironic too because I mean black mole

6518.76 --> 6521.6
is kind of [ __ ] up

6522.06 --> 6530.1
but apparently they figured a way to

6526.679 --> 6533.88
to tame this [ __ ] up little fungus and

6530.1 --> 6535.860000000001
make it create vitamin C or improve it

6533.88 --> 6538.46
so

6535.86 --> 6538.46
cool

6539.94 --> 6544.71
I mean that is kind of cool

6541.48 --> 6544.709999999999
[Music]

6552.719 --> 6559.44
yeah it is a bit disturbing but I mean

6556.26 --> 6561.54
yeah I mean that's just that's just

6559.44 --> 6563.9
chemistry man chemistry could get kind

6561.54 --> 6563.9
of weird

6565.139 --> 6571.38
but I mean it's not the first thing

6568.46 --> 6573.08
fermentation is a

6571.38 --> 6576.84
a very

6573.08 --> 6579.36
ancient tradition like in Japan for

6576.84 --> 6581.88
example but I mean look at all these

6579.36 --> 6582.96
different type of fungi that have been

6581.88 --> 6587.46
around

6582.96 --> 6591.659
like for sourdough bread

6587.46 --> 6593.28
and bread like the yeast in bread that's

6591.659 --> 6594.9
that's a fungus

6593.28 --> 6597.3
it's a yeast

6594.9 --> 6599.94
like it's been out there for quite a

6597.3 --> 6604.5
while and that they managed to figure

6599.94 --> 6607.5599999999995
out how to use that hostile toxic fungus

6604.5 --> 6609.78
of the black mold and certainly managed

6607.56 --> 6612.9800000000005
to tame it into something like that well

6609.78 --> 6612.98
that's pretty cool

6613.32 --> 6616.759999999999
it's pretty cool if you'd ask me

6625.92 --> 6631.46
hey here we go again it's been a while

6628.38 --> 6631.46
since I seen you

6646.17 --> 6649.47
[Music]

6651.84 --> 6657.719
sourdough yes Mark but it is it is a lot

6655.199 --> 6660.619
healthy I've been eating

6657.719 --> 6660.619
sourdough

6660.659 --> 6664.5
for

6662.4 --> 6669.719
at over a decade

6664.5 --> 6669.719
pretty consistent since 2000

6671.639 --> 6676.679
nine

6673.199 --> 6678.419999999999
I think it's when I really like okay I'm

6676.679 --> 6682.92
I'm just

6678.42 --> 6685.26
no I'm leaving wheat I left wheat behind

6682.92 --> 6687.2390000000005
so I went for the spelled type bread and

6685.26 --> 6688.92
which was getting very popular in

6687.239 --> 6690.959999999999
organic circles there is spelled bread

6688.92 --> 6693.36
in organic circles everywhere

6690.96 --> 6696.0
in the supermarket so that's great

6693.36 --> 6698.82
and they had sourdough so it spelled

6696.0 --> 6701.4
sourdough it's the best bread ever

6698.82 --> 6703.88
it's just so much better it's so much

6701.4 --> 6703.879999999999
healthier

6707.48 --> 6712.58
sourdough eliminates that acid what

6716.159 --> 6721.08
all right yes yes yes correct

6729.06 --> 6734.820000000001
right so it's good stuff I I've eaten

6732.42 --> 6736.5
sourdough bread like when I get my baked

6734.82 --> 6738.239
eggs which is really the only thing I

6736.5 --> 6740.28
still even eat with bread

6738.239 --> 6743.099999999999
before that I used to eat hamburgers a

6740.28 --> 6746.219
lot I don't really eat that anymore I

6743.1 --> 6749.639
just ate too much something I've eaten

6746.219 --> 6751.92
like a thousand hamburgers and then I

6749.639 --> 6754.1990000000005
was kind of sick of it even though they

6751.92 --> 6755.82
were organic and all that and I I make

6754.199 --> 6758.339999999999
them very nice

6755.82 --> 6760.08
I just like I've I've had too many

6758.34 --> 6762.119000000001
hamburgers

6760.08 --> 6765.84
now I eat french fries all the time

6762.119 --> 6768.5599999999995
which is also cheaper

6765.84 --> 6768.56
uh

6770.4 --> 6776.4
but yeah I eat it with my baked eggs and

6773.82 --> 6778.08
sourdough bread it's just

6776.4 --> 6781.32
it's

6778.08 --> 6784.8
like that's the actual bread

6781.32 --> 6787.08
once you get to eat like sourdough

6784.8 --> 6789.84
good types of bread

6787.08 --> 6794.58
you realize that what you thought was

6789.84 --> 6797.04
regular bread is just basically sugar

6794.58 --> 6799.679
disguised as bread it's just garbage

6797.04 --> 6801.84
it's bad it's really bad for you it's

6799.679 --> 6804.36
poisonous like it

6801.84 --> 6806.46
you get something out of it but you'll

6804.36 --> 6809.28
also be paying a price every single time

6806.46 --> 6811.58
with regular bread especially like white

6809.28 --> 6811.58
bread

6813.06 --> 6818.06
white wheat bread

6815.4 --> 6818.0599999999995

6820.699 --> 6825.299999999999
fermented cannabis

6823.739 --> 6830.9
[ __ ]

6825.3 --> 6830.900000000001
no I've not tried that that sounds weird

6833.46 --> 6838.32
I mean I did try to smoke a piece of

6836.219 --> 6841.56
cannabis that seemed kind of moldy one

6838.32 --> 6845.9
time don't recommend it

6841.56 --> 6845.900000000001
I was not particularly Pleasant

6850.139 --> 6856.32
oh making you hungry oops

6853.26 --> 6859.58
making myself hungry too actually

6856.32 --> 6859.58
it is kind of lunch time

6868.679 --> 6871.4
weird

6878.82 --> 6883.699
but I mean yeah Mark I I bet that

6881.219 --> 6886.8
fermented cannabis could work I mean

6883.699 --> 6888.599999999999
fermented fish oil works there's a whole

6886.8 --> 6890.76
bunch of fermented things and it works

6888.6 --> 6892.619000000001
fantastic

6890.76 --> 6895.5
so

6892.619 --> 6897.839999999999
not that it's like oh yummy oh I love

6895.5 --> 6900.6
that fermented things no it is usually

6897.84 --> 6903.08
disgusting but it's really [ __ ]

6900.6 --> 6903.08
healthy

6903.179 --> 6909.3
oh my dad when I was like really young

6906.719 --> 6911.159
eight or something like made me eat

6909.3 --> 6914.360000000001
these yeast

6911.159 --> 6917.339999999999
pills that I had to chew it was

6914.36 --> 6920.099999999999
unbelievably disgusting

6917.34 --> 6922.58
but man that stuff is apparently really

6920.1 --> 6922.58
healthy

6923.76 --> 6928.9800000000005
and he made me eat those and I had to

6925.92 --> 6931.679
chew them couldn't just swallow them

6928.98 --> 6933.119
and then I got bits of chocolate to

6931.679 --> 6937.38
compensate

6933.119 --> 6939.0
but that didn't actually help it was

6937.38 --> 6941.78
still disgusting

6939.0 --> 6941.78
ah

6944.04 --> 6951.26
but yeah yeast it's good for you

6948.179 --> 6951.26
the right types

6952.199 --> 6956.96
cannabis based fuel

6964.679 --> 6970.38
okay Mark yeah I guess I guess you could

6968.94 --> 6974.0
do that

6970.38 --> 6974.0
wow never even thought of that

6974.52 --> 6980.34
did you imagine your car running on

6977.84 --> 6983.659000000001
cannabis fuel

6980.34 --> 6983.659000000001
on cannabis

6988.44 --> 6991.099999999999
alcohol

6993.36 --> 7000.759999999999
that would be kind of weird

6996.84 --> 7000.76
if it works it works I mean

7004.4 --> 7010.099999999999
hemp is like useful for everything so if

7007.639 --> 7011.900000000001
you can make alcohol out of it I

7010.1 --> 7015.02
wouldn't be surprised

7011.9 --> 7018.44
if you could make methanol

7015.02 --> 7022.1
or biodiesel I mean what can't you make

7018.44 --> 7025.239
with hemp I'm serious like what can you

7022.1 --> 7025.2390000000005
not make with hemp

7025.54 --> 7031.699
I I bet that if you worked at it you

7029.48 --> 7033.739
could probably even make a rubber with

7031.699 --> 7036.379999999999
hemp okay I don't think there's anything

7033.739 --> 7039.4
you can't make out of him besides

7036.38 --> 7039.400000000001

7054.099 --> 7059.659000000001
hemp shoes

7056.36 --> 7061.58
to be fair I'm not particular fan of

7059.659 --> 7064.219
hemp cloth

7061.58 --> 7066.739
but that's me

7064.219 --> 7068.84
I don't like that I don't like hemp

7066.739 --> 7070.339999999999
cloth like hippies oh everything's

7068.84 --> 7072.7390000000005
handball it's so environmentally

7070.34 --> 7076.159000000001
friendly yeah but it sucks

7072.739 --> 7078.32
and like you can really like just set it

7076.159 --> 7082.598999999999
on fire and then you'd be like a wicker

7078.32 --> 7082.599
man like uh no

7083.659 --> 7088.58
I don't like it as clothes but you can

7086.42 --> 7092.719
make pretty good sacks out of it like

7088.58 --> 7095.48
sex for sand or other things

7092.719 --> 7099.32
so there's a lot of useful it's like

7095.48 --> 7102.0199999999995
useful industrial cloth amp

7099.32 --> 7105.199
but I do consider it industrial and not

7102.02 --> 7108.679
really useful for wear for clothing

7105.199 --> 7112.719
there's just way better stuff for that

7108.679 --> 7116.36
although Maybe by now there's like hemp

7112.719 --> 7119.84
microfiber it's just as good as silk so

7116.36 --> 7122.719
maybe that exists by now okay in that

7119.84 --> 7124.58
case yeah that could be pretty badass if

7122.719 --> 7126.5
you could refine it even further

7124.58 --> 7129.139
what you can do with it

7126.5 --> 7131.599
but in the past like hemp clothing like

7129.139 --> 7135.04
always seemed like I don't want to wear

7131.599 --> 7135.04
a straw man suit

7135.32 --> 7139.94
and it's itchy

7137.9 --> 7143.619
just like why don't like wearing wool

7139.94 --> 7143.619
because it just itches like hell

7145.34 --> 7150.43
I'm really a cotton guy cotton

yeah it's interesting hemp joints

7183.679 --> 7188.2390000000005
that is a Hampshire and was super soft

okay

7319.04 --> 7321.699
are you

7323.599 --> 7330.28
so you're saying that hemp

7326.719 --> 7330.28
is anaerobic

7330.86 --> 7334.349999999999
I'm not entirely sure what you're saying

here more color

7350.48 --> 7353.86

7360.679 --> 7367.52
what but that makes no sense

7364.28 --> 7371.32
fermentation is molding

7367.52 --> 7371.320000000001
how can it be anaerobic

7377.9 --> 7380.259999999999
because

7382.099 --> 7387.9800000000005
yeah I mean yeah after the fungus has

7384.8 --> 7390.860000000001
processed it it's going to be

7387.98 --> 7393.98
processed and then fungus can process it

7390.86 --> 7396.5599999999995
anymore yeah duh because it just did

7393.98 --> 7398.598999999999
so that makes sense it's like oh why

7396.56 --> 7402.679
don't ashes burn

7398.599 --> 7405.099
because what made it burn just got

7402.679 --> 7405.099
burned

it's like yeah wrap it in leaves then

7588.02 --> 7593.4800000000005
bury it under your goat shed

7590.78 --> 7596.0599999999995

better ways to ferment that

7639.679 --> 7642.219
uh

7655.159 --> 7662.0199999999995
I can't put it under the compost piles

that's like almost too much it's like

7724.82 --> 7729.139
my show

7726.739 --> 7730.759999999999
with me ranting a raving and pushing

7729.139 --> 7733.719

7730.76 --> 7733.719
bit too intense

there should be better ways to ferment

what

7980.719 --> 7986.619
they dried and then beat them with

sticks okay

7987.92 --> 7990.76
oh

7998.119 --> 8002.44
that sounds kind of like the processing

8000.219 --> 8005.88
of flour

8002.44 --> 8005.879999999999
in the medieval way

8008.079 --> 8012.28

8036.96 --> 8042.119
what the [ __ ] is that no big ass

8051.4 --> 8056.679
put my life and my yeah but I do I

8055.0 --> 8059.199
definitely

8056.679 --> 8061.179
follow Jesus's teachings but he's not

8059.199 --> 8063.719
God

8061.179 --> 8066.76
and I'm not gonna surrender to this

8063.719 --> 8068.7390000000005
amazing feeling

8066.76 --> 8071.1990000000005
that is tied in with things that are

8068.739 --> 8073.36
literally self-contradicting

8071.199 --> 8074.98
and when I listen to Jesus's words that

8073.36 --> 8076.42
is a little bit when he's being a bit

8074.98 --> 8079.0599999999995
more mystical

8076.42 --> 8081.46
I'm not going to take it literal and

8079.06 --> 8082.780000000001
then claim that that is logical and you

8081.46 --> 8085.84
have to believe it or you go to hell

8082.78 --> 8090.179
like I'm not doing it I'm really really

8085.84 --> 8090.179
not doing that lumping ass in a vacuum

8101.86 --> 8108.579
yeah I I just I'm much more curious as

8105.4 --> 8110.92
to like who Jesus really was

8108.579 --> 8113.619
and

8110.92 --> 8114.82
just what has happened what is this

8113.619 --> 8117.579
thing

8114.82 --> 8122.159
this thing that came out of it

8117.579 --> 8122.159
after his death that people created

8124.599 --> 8130.78
and what is this Christ spirit

8127.119 --> 8133.239
that is there that I still use

8130.78 --> 8137.38
I mean there is it is there is it from

8133.239 --> 8139.718999999999
Jesus or was Jesus like

8137.38 --> 8142.0
first one to recognize them like what is

8139.719 --> 8144.159
it was it thereafter is that like

8142.0 --> 8146.099
there's still a lot of mysteries in this

8144.159 --> 8149.5599999999995

8146.099 --> 8151.84
esoteric mystery spiritual Mysteries and

8149.56 --> 8155.159000000001
I do absolutely believe that Jesus is

8151.84 --> 8155.159000000001
extremely significant

8156.46 --> 8162.52
and the Messiah arguably

8160.06 --> 8165.219
but I also think that just this religion

8162.52 --> 8168.900000000001
that is rolled out of it is just

8165.219 --> 8168.9
chronically delusional

8185.44 --> 8188.759999999999
right later skeptic

8192.04 --> 8194.099
no

8193.54 --> 8196.599
no

8194.099 --> 8198.460000000001
lumpy guys this is where I'm literally

8196.599 --> 8200.74
gonna say no

8198.46 --> 8203.38
no [ __ ] chanting I don't want to hear

8200.74 --> 8205.66
it ever

8203.38 --> 8207.639
nothing you just said makes logical

8205.66 --> 8210.039999999999
sense

8207.639 --> 8211.479
everybody's heard it everybody knows

8210.04 --> 8213.580000000002
what that is

8211.479 --> 8216.34
it doesn't make sense

8213.58 --> 8220.3
it never made sense

8216.34 --> 8224.939
it making sense is a confidence Ponzi

8220.3 --> 8228.599
scheme it is an emperor without clothes

8224.939 --> 8228.599
mental scheme

8229.84 --> 8232.979
it's not real

8236.979 --> 8243.639
if if that gives you Euphoria for for

8241.179 --> 8248.82
reality then you could just make

8243.639 --> 8248.82
anything be euphoric in reality

8249.46 --> 8256.479
it's a form of magical thinking that may

8252.939 --> 8259.12
be very liberating and all that kind of

8256.479 --> 8261.76
like the hippie revolution in many ways

8259.12 --> 8264.880000000001
were liberating yeah but what it wasn't

8261.76 --> 8267.899
was logical

8264.88 --> 8273.0
and I refuse to give into that

8267.899 --> 8273.0
vulnerability it's a human vulnerability

8276.719 --> 8284.38
Satan has a lot of buttons he can push

8281.8 --> 8286.0
in humans and this is one of them and I

8284.38 --> 8288.88
refuse

8286.0 --> 8291.3
to become part of that I don't want to

8288.88 --> 8291.3
do it

8292.059 --> 8296.5
yeah and

8293.74 --> 8299.199999999999
stop you can stop trying to describe God

8296.5 --> 8302.62
to me because everything you say about

8299.2 --> 8305.320000000002
God while you are act like this is all

8302.62 --> 8307.960000000001
degrading to God

8305.32 --> 8308.979
it's all trying to put down something

8307.96 --> 8311.559
great

8308.979 --> 8313.479
in a light that is really very

8311.559 --> 8315.518999999998
underwhelming when you think of the

8313.479 --> 8318.519
grand scheme of things

8315.519 --> 8320.800000000001
so it's bringing God down to try to

8318.519 --> 8323.880000000001
describe him like this it's literally

8320.8 --> 8323.88
bringing him down

8335.139 --> 8342.479
your beliefs believe it's about logic

8338.019 --> 8342.479
I I don't care for beliefs

8342.82 --> 8349.199999999999
belief is only there to carry you

8345.399 --> 8349.199999999999
through as a hunch yeah

8350.26 --> 8355.300000000001
but when you face the facts you can't

8352.78 --> 8358.26
let the hunch be a hunch anymore you

8355.3 --> 8358.259999999998
have to get real

8382.599 --> 8387.939
yeah you can't just say like oh we have

8384.939 --> 8390.460000000001
to be dead dead on logical and oh

8387.939 --> 8392.26
fallacy this fallacy that oh you try to

8390.46 --> 8394.599999999999
escape the argument oh you're straw

8392.26 --> 8396.7
mining me and then be super hardcore

8394.6 --> 8399.1
about that but then on the other side

8396.7 --> 8401.62
say like oh but this is my freedom

8399.1 --> 8404.2
special place this is where we can be

8401.62 --> 8406.18
hippies and we call that Christian and

8404.2 --> 8408.220000000001
oh we can just say all these things and

8406.18 --> 8410.439
chant and everybody knows the chant and

8408.22 --> 8412.84
it makes no [ __ ] sense and it never

8410.439 --> 8414.7
did it just feels really good and feels

8412.84 --> 8416.56
like oh yeah I could do this chant and

8414.7 --> 8419.68
where everybody accepts it because they

8416.56 --> 8420.939
all do it yeah it's a [ __ ] Ponzi

8419.68 --> 8424.02
scheme

8420.939 --> 8427.439
it's a Ponzi scheme it's a confidence

8424.02 --> 8427.439
Ponzi scheme

8427.78 --> 8433.42
it doesn't make logical sense

8430.84 --> 8436.24
it only feels good

8433.42 --> 8439.0
that's the only thing it does it's

8436.24 --> 8441.22
magical thinking and it doesn't make any

8439.0 --> 8443.859
[ __ ] sense

8441.22 --> 8446.5
I will not accept I will not surrender

8443.859 --> 8450.220000000001
to this good feeling

8446.5 --> 8452.8
that is rooted in illogic I think that's

8450.22 --> 8456.279999999999
Satan I think that's Satan being a very

8452.8 --> 8460.06
eloquent enabler right there

8456.28 --> 8462.28
like oh no you can do magical thinking

8460.06 --> 8464.199999999999
you're doing it for God you're doing it

8462.28 --> 8468.819000000001
for Christ so magical thinking's all

8464.2 --> 8468.819000000001
right yeah yeah nice trick Satan

8470.5 --> 8477.12
Satan is lies God is truth if you

8474.04 --> 8477.12
Embrace logic

8477.34 --> 8482.380000000001
then you'll find truth if you Embrace a

8481.42 --> 8485.5
chant

8482.38 --> 8490.199999999999
in the name of God

8485.5 --> 8490.2
for fear of rejection

8490.42 --> 8495.64
you have fear another trait of Satan

8492.76 --> 8498.16
yeah then you are actually following a

8495.64 --> 8500.08
Satan's Ploy you're following something

8498.16 --> 8502.6
from Satan you're following something

8500.08 --> 8506.2
that doesn't make any sense and it is

8502.6 --> 8509.2
your fears that actually

8506.2 --> 8512.439
push you around Fierce and and just a

8509.2 --> 8514.66
great sensation the sensation of God of

8512.439 --> 8517.66
loving the child and all these things

8514.66 --> 8521.08
all these good feelings yeah but they're

8517.66 --> 8524.26
not Guided by Logic they're Unleashed

8521.08 --> 8526.78
by accepting something that you cannot

8524.26 --> 8529.0
logically justify

8526.78 --> 8531.7
and that's a fact that's where you

8529.0 --> 8533.5
literally take a step away from God from

8531.7 --> 8536.859
logic from the truth

8533.5 --> 8539.399
and move towards feelings

8536.859 --> 8542.880000000001
and fair

8539.399 --> 8542.88
Satan's Realm

8548.92 --> 8553.14
yeah I'm doing this for a good reason

8553.18 --> 8559.42
I'm going against a majority in this

8557.02 --> 8562.359
that thinking they're doing a revolution

8559.42 --> 8566.399
against Satan when they're very [ __ ]

8562.359 --> 8566.399000000001
roots are from Satan

8567.28 --> 8571.84
I'm not gonna do the yelling thing again

8569.14 --> 8574.479
but I mean this is what's happening

8571.84 --> 8576.52
and it worries me a lot I really want

8574.479 --> 8579.16
people to see through this I want people

8576.52 --> 8582.1
to ascend within their attempt to be

8579.16 --> 8585.34
Christian I want them to ascend

8582.1 --> 8587.26
I want them to see it

8585.34 --> 8591.0
you can't

8587.26 --> 8591.0
argue this

8591.399 --> 8595.779999999999
it's

8592.6 --> 8598.84
lumpy gas I don't give a [ __ ] about

8595.78 --> 8600.76
belief I think that belief is an

8598.84 --> 8602.74
atrocity

8600.76 --> 8607.78
I think that belief

8602.74 --> 8610.84
is surrender to Satan if you believe

8607.78 --> 8613.84
when you cannot justify the belief

8610.84 --> 8617.02
logically and you hold on to that and

8613.84 --> 8618.880000000001
you get logical argumentation and proof

8617.02 --> 8622.92
against it and you still hold on to it

8618.88 --> 8622.92
you hold on to a lie

8624.12 --> 8628.54
thank you

8626.439 --> 8631.24
if you focus on something that's

8628.54 --> 8634.84
illogical you're holding on to a lie you

8631.24 --> 8638.92
could achieve the same end result

8634.84 --> 8640.72
but not chanting and just doing the

8638.92 --> 8643.24
right thing

8640.72 --> 8645.22
and following good advice

8643.24 --> 8648.1
and do unto others as you would have

8645.22 --> 8650.979
them do unto you and all those wise

8648.1 --> 8654.1
teachings of Jesus which are the real

8650.979 --> 8657.22
thing that is what it really is that's

8654.1 --> 8659.02
the thing that is logical that

8657.22 --> 8661.84
immediately in response to somebody

8659.02 --> 8667.24
saying that you could immediately argue

8661.84 --> 8671.08
exactly why that works yeah that's the

8667.24 --> 8675.22
real thing that's the logic that's God

8671.08 --> 8678.039999999999
yeah a chant that you cannot logically

8675.22 --> 8681.699999999999
justify you just have to believe that's

8678.04 --> 8685.42
not God that's Satan that Satan luring

8681.7 --> 8688.359
you into letting down your faculties in

8685.42 --> 8690.76
the favor of feelings

8688.359 --> 8694.33
pushed around by fear

8690.76 --> 8697.61
yeah that's Satan's domain not gods

8694.33 --> 8697.61
[Music]

8706.68 --> 8712.12
sure

8708.6 --> 8714.04
oh yes if that be all thank you for your

8712.12 --> 8716.979000000001
amazing input

8714.04 --> 8719.380000000001
so useful

8716.979 --> 8720.819
toss it talking esoterics here said

8719.38 --> 8724.14
happy

8720.819 --> 8724.14
talking esoterics

8724.3 --> 8731.019999999999
yeah Satan is a force is an influence is

8727.06 --> 8734.199999999999
one side of the coin is in effect it's

8731.02 --> 8735.399000000001
something it does things it's an

8734.2 --> 8739.0
influence

8735.399 --> 8742.479
yeah I'm not talking about a personified

8739.0 --> 8744.52
figure or even a consciousness of an

8742.479 --> 8746.64
individual I'm not talking about any of

8744.52 --> 8746.640000000001
that

8747.04 --> 8751.78
talking about the influence the force of

8750.939 --> 8755.7
it

8751.78 --> 8760.18
the force of Darkness the force of Satan

8755.7 --> 8762.640000000001
lies lies are his domain lies Sprout

8760.18 --> 8765.04
forth all the things

8762.64 --> 8766.42
that make you turn away from God all of

8765.04 --> 8769.78
it

8766.42 --> 8774.58
the strength turns away

8769.78 --> 8777.24
the Insight you gain delusion you lose

8774.58 --> 8783.24
strength that's all satan all of it

8777.24 --> 8783.24
directly provably esoterically logically

8783.46 --> 8788.438999999998
and that's what I care about

8786.1 --> 8791.859
care of the essence

8788.439 --> 8794.74
not other how not on how dedicated you

8791.859 --> 8798.880000000001
are to a a riddle

8794.74 --> 8802.6
that you cannot logically argue

8798.88 --> 8806.019999999999
I refuse to do that I will not give in

8802.6 --> 8806.859
to any form of contemporary social peer

8806.02 --> 8811.060000000001
pressure

8806.859 --> 8813.34
based on somebody else's fear I will not

8811.06 --> 8817.5
give in under any circumstances

8813.34 --> 8817.5
including torture and death

8822.96 --> 8828.699999999999
yeah perfect sacrifice yeah you know

8825.58 --> 8831.88
there's a whole category of people that

8828.7 --> 8833.68
are very preoccupied with the idea of

8831.88 --> 8836.56
sacrifice

8833.68 --> 8837.819
and paying off sins you know who those

8836.56 --> 8839.619999999999
are

8837.819 --> 8842.849
yeah you know who those are

8839.62 --> 8842.849
[Music]

8844.78 --> 8851.34
or will you take that hypocrisy

8848.2 --> 8851.34
with gladness

8865.78 --> 8870.399000000001
if you say that there has to be some

8868.42 --> 8874.02
kind of atonement that there has to be

8870.399 --> 8879.22
some kind of blood sacrifice to negate

8874.02 --> 8883.18
sacrifices then you submit

8879.22 --> 8885.399
to the idea that sacrifices are an

8883.18 --> 8887.62
integral part

8885.399 --> 8892.24
of existence

8887.62 --> 8897.0
and not a devilish Superstition to bind

8892.24 --> 8897.0
you into sin which is what it is

8899.62 --> 8905.2
nobody needed to be sacrificed in order

8902.8 --> 8909.22
so that you don't have to sacrifice

8905.2 --> 8912.04
anymore because that presupposes the

8909.22 --> 8914.679999999998
necessity to sacrifice

8912.04 --> 8918.76
which is an atrocity

8914.68 --> 8921.939
which Jesus literally said that he

8918.76 --> 8925.84
literally made work to stop that from

8921.939 --> 8929.26
happening yeah in any way

8925.84 --> 8931.06
reasoning in different ways to make it

8929.26 --> 8934.479
stop

8931.06 --> 8939.899
to make people stop presupposing you

8934.479 --> 8939.899
have to sacrifice to please the Creator

8944.979 --> 8953.019999999999
yeah no more no but it was never needed

8948.16 --> 8954.119999999999
you see it was never needed that's the

8953.02 --> 8955.720000000001
point

8954.12 --> 8957.819000000001
foreign

8955.72 --> 8961.74
yeah

8957.819 --> 8961.74
it was never needed

8962.56 --> 8970.24
and Jesus was simply there

8965.8 --> 8973.599999999999
to elucidate people about that

8970.24 --> 8975.939
it wasn't needed but he couldn't overtly

8973.6 --> 8978.460000000001
directly convince them because it's like

8975.939 --> 8980.979000000001
the foundation of everything

8978.46 --> 8984.819
it's like part of their tradition it's

8980.979 --> 8986.5
what bound people into it

8984.819 --> 8989.619999999999
so

8986.5 --> 8992.2
asked for the prophecy he argued it

8989.62 --> 8995.740000000002
isn't required anymore and then people

8992.2 --> 9000.240000000002
made out because he set that out of his

8995.74 --> 9002.039999999999
mouth when he was alive yeah he did not

9000.24 --> 9003.72
die

9002.04 --> 9007.319000000001
for that

9003.72 --> 9009.3
he declared it it was there when he was

9007.319 --> 9011.58
alive he did not say oh oh yeah yeah

9009.3 --> 9014.46
well you know what all this sacrifice

9011.58 --> 9015.96
stuff yeah yeah when I die you don't

9014.46 --> 9020.46
have to do it anymore

9015.96 --> 9023.099999999999
no he just said you don't have to do it

9020.46 --> 9025.319
anymore you don't have to do this yeah

9023.1 --> 9026.460000000001
it was not after he died

9025.319 --> 9028.619999999999
yeah

9026.46 --> 9030.8
so why don't you get your [ __ ] facts

9028.62 --> 9030.800000000001
straight

9031.5 --> 9036.66
yeah

9033.6 --> 9039.54
I'm so sick of these chants

9036.66 --> 9040.92
I'm so sick of them I don't care if they

9039.54 --> 9043.26
come out of good people you're

9040.92 --> 9046.16
delusional I'm sick of it I can't I

9043.26 --> 9046.16
can't take it anymore

9059.28 --> 9065.880000000001
if you say that Jesus died as an

9063.359 --> 9069.0
offering so that you don't have to do

9065.88 --> 9072.539999999999
that anymore then you presuppose that

9069.0 --> 9076.56
you're in a universe that has a standard

9072.54 --> 9080.460000000001
necessity for sacrifice offering yeah

9076.56 --> 9084.319
that's what you presuppose when you say

9080.46 --> 9084.319
that do you realize that

9084.42 --> 9090.5
you realize what you say

9087.24 --> 9090.5
I bet you did not

9097.16 --> 9103.08
and me and you I don't know who this

9100.439 --> 9106.380000000001
this I think it's lumpy gas in a vacuum

9103.08 --> 9109.52
I'm not directing anything not I'm

9106.38 --> 9109.519999999999
talking General now

9117.72 --> 9123.779999999999
the two

9120.479 --> 9126.599999999999
the two lightning what

9123.78 --> 9129.0
oh wait

9126.6 --> 9130.979000000001
purpose is for us to be more like the

9129.0 --> 9134.72
Creator yeah but

9130.979 --> 9134.72
what the hell does that even mean

9136.56 --> 9142.38
what the hell is the creator like in

9139.02 --> 9144.479000000001
order for us to even be more like him

9142.38 --> 9146.339999999998
I don't think so why the hell would we

9144.479 --> 9149.76
be like the Creator

9146.34 --> 9153.54
we just have to follow his design he

9149.76 --> 9157.2
designed it in a way and if you want to

9153.54 --> 9159.6
do it right if you want to attune to his

9157.2 --> 9160.68
design then you have to attune to his

9159.6 --> 9166.16
ways

9160.68 --> 9166.16
so his design shows his ways

9167.58 --> 9172.68
sin

9169.62 --> 9175.859
are revealed through the punishment that

9172.68 --> 9178.979000000001
they bring of what they do to you what

9175.859 --> 9181.859
faculties they take away from you it's

9178.979 --> 9185.279999999999
in the design the punishment is in the

9181.859 --> 9188.42
design the rule is in the design it's

9185.28 --> 9188.42
all in the design

9191.359 --> 9196.859
that's where you get it

9194.76 --> 9199.34
that's where you learn that's where you

9196.859 --> 9199.34
find out

9199.92 --> 9206.54
not in some chant

9202.92 --> 9206.54
from a priest

9209.28 --> 9214.5
that's called giving up that's called

9211.38 --> 9217.58
surrendering your faculties to a swarm

9214.5 --> 9217.58
to a group

9218.22 --> 9225.06
and letting that inquiry and that

9221.939 --> 9227.58
logical Pursuit be replaced by an

9225.06 --> 9231.0
illogical chat that you cannot justify

9227.58 --> 9234.3
yeah that's called giving up

9231.0 --> 9237.0
giving up the quest giving up this path

9234.3 --> 9239.699999999999
giving up the Ascension

9237.0 --> 9243.02
you're agreeing to halting your own

9239.7 --> 9243.02
growth when you do that

9252.3 --> 9257.16
so I hope that none of you take this

9254.46 --> 9259.019999999999
very personal like that

9257.16 --> 9262.939
but I am trying to get through to you

9259.02 --> 9262.939
what I'm saying is very serious here

9262.979 --> 9269.22
you know that this is logical you can

9266.28 --> 9273.359
listen to what I just said look at it in

9269.22 --> 9275.58
your mind and see it connect up what I

9273.359 --> 9279.42
say is real

9275.58 --> 9281.819
you can logically justify it yeah you

9279.42 --> 9284.76
can't do that with these chants

9281.819 --> 9287.519999999999
they are not justifiable

9284.76 --> 9290.460000000001
the only thing that can be done is oh

9287.52 --> 9293.1
you want to that explain the chant well

9290.46 --> 9295.74
here's another priest who talked about

9293.1 --> 9297.300000000001
it oh guess what you're gonna listen to

9295.74 --> 9298.979
him he's gonna say a couple of wise

9297.3 --> 9300.179999999998
things and then it's not going to be

9298.979 --> 9302.099999999999
resolved

9300.18 --> 9303.720000000001
and then oh oh I'm gonna look for

9302.1 --> 9305.52
another person oh he's gonna talk about

9303.72 --> 9307.619999999999
it too while you're safe and this and

9305.52 --> 9311.220000000001
that yeah and he's not gonna justify it

9307.62 --> 9313.08
either because nobody does there is no

9311.22 --> 9315.119999999999
justification it's like the globe

9313.08 --> 9317.22
religion all the proof has got to be out

9315.12 --> 9319.140000000001
there somewhere it's got to be somewhere

9317.22 --> 9320.58
oh let's go to this person talking about

9319.14 --> 9323.279999999999
oh guess what he's going to talk about

9320.58 --> 9324.899
say a couple of cool sounding things and

9323.28 --> 9326.640000000001
then not explain oh you're gonna look

9324.899 --> 9328.68
for another one then oh will you find

9326.64 --> 9330.779999999999
another one they're talking about it oh

9328.68 --> 9332.819
guess what they're not really explaining

9330.78 --> 9337.68
it well either yeah

9332.819 --> 9341.039999999999
it's a priesthood it's the same thing it

9337.68 --> 9345.380000000001
came out of the same group of people the

9341.04 --> 9349.380000000001
globe came out of the same priests

9345.38 --> 9352.38
that delivered you this satanic

9349.38 --> 9355.759999999998
fake Christianity

9352.38 --> 9358.259999999998
based on chant

9355.76 --> 9362.64
illogical chant

9358.26 --> 9365.479
and ignorance towards the words of the

9362.64 --> 9365.479
actual Messiah

9368.58 --> 9373.819
yeah

9369.899 --> 9376.26
ignorance ignorance of the Messiah

9373.819 --> 9379.319
listening to the group

9376.26 --> 9382.380000000001
to men listening to men over the Messiah

9379.319 --> 9384.479
trusting their chance

9382.38 --> 9387.479
that did not come out of Jesus's mouth

9384.479 --> 9389.64
did not come out of there he did not

9387.479 --> 9393.899
make those claims

9389.64 --> 9395.519999999999
yeah going to me going through me if you

9393.899 --> 9397.92
want to get to the father yeah that does

9395.52 --> 9400.979000000001
not mean if you don't believe that I am

9397.92 --> 9402.84
God then you go to hell yeah that's not

9400.979 --> 9405.66
what that says

9402.84 --> 9407.7
do you understand that that is not the

9405.66 --> 9410.34
same [ __ ] thing

9407.7 --> 9414.300000000001
when he said that

9410.34 --> 9416.78
yeah now let go of this chance

9414.3 --> 9420.3
Let It Go they were a priest made

9416.78 --> 9421.92
man-made the same priests that devised

9420.3 --> 9424.019999999999
the globe Earth

9421.92 --> 9427.5
without a god

9424.02 --> 9429.720000000001
and life that created itself yeah it's

9427.5 --> 9433.26
the same Source the same source that

9429.72 --> 9437.039999999999
came up with that [ __ ] they also made up

9433.26 --> 9439.5
this chant this chant about Jesus how he

9437.04 --> 9441.54
had to die so you could squirt

9439.5 --> 9443.399
and if you don't believe it you go to

9441.54 --> 9448.399000000001
hell yeah

9443.399 --> 9448.399
that's man-made not Jesus

9455.31 --> 9460.92
[Music]

9457.88 --> 9465.42
logic cannot solve the sin problem yes

9460.92 --> 9468.12
it [ __ ] can if you simply face as to

9465.42 --> 9470.52
what sin is and what is real and what is

9468.12 --> 9473.58
not then you can properly do something

9470.52 --> 9475.560000000001
about it because you're not lost and

9473.58 --> 9477.96
your instincts are not just gonna reach

9475.56 --> 9481.5
back to that which is familiar to it

9477.96 --> 9483.479
because you have logic to guide you and

9481.5 --> 9484.319
to tell you what is right and what is

9483.479 --> 9486.979
wrong

9484.319 --> 9486.979
yeah

9487.04 --> 9494.34
logic can absolutely solve the sin

9491.22 --> 9499.46
problem because with logic you can

9494.34 --> 9499.460000000001
distinguish what is sin and what isn't

9504.65 --> 9508.059
[Music]

9511.03 --> 9515.399000000001
[Music]

9512.52 --> 9518.640000000001
was it logic that caused Noah to build

9515.399 --> 9520.08
the ark when it never rained yes

9518.64 --> 9522.899
you know why

9520.08 --> 9524.34
because he saw a vision

9522.899 --> 9526.68
of

9524.34 --> 9530.1
rain and drowning

9526.68 --> 9531.18
and you know what he concluded thanks to

9530.1 --> 9532.74
logic

9531.18 --> 9534.66
yeah

9532.74 --> 9535.979
if

9534.66 --> 9538.02
if

9535.979 --> 9540.0
there would need if there it could be

9538.02 --> 9542.04
survival in the face of this thing

9540.0 --> 9544.38
that's going to happen

9542.04 --> 9547.380000000001
well then I need a boat

9544.38 --> 9548.88
that's called logical reasoning

9547.38 --> 9552.42
yeah

9548.88 --> 9556.14
he could a more non-logic based

9552.42 --> 9558.84
conclusion would be we're all gonna die

9556.14 --> 9560.819
yep it's over

9558.84 --> 9562.5
yeah because what are you gonna do a

9560.819 --> 9564.72
giant flood yeah everything's gonna die

9562.5 --> 9566.28
yeah no that's

9564.72 --> 9567.96
not

9566.28 --> 9570.66
thinking about it it's not like hey

9567.96 --> 9574.619999999999
maybe you could do something about it

9570.66 --> 9578.399
no he argued he reasoned he used his

9574.62 --> 9579.240000000002
logical faculties to figure out like a

9578.399 --> 9582.3
boat

9579.24 --> 9584.699999999999
a boat could save it

9582.3 --> 9586.92
I have to build a boat how the hell do

9584.7 --> 9590.34
you build a boat well you you use a

9586.92 --> 9593.939
logic logic of carpentry

9590.34 --> 9598.68
right all these things and yeah whatever

9593.939 --> 9600.960000000001
the point is is that yeah you need logic

9598.68 --> 9603.18
yeah just because you had a vision or a

9600.96 --> 9605.58
dream doesn't mean that that is not

9603.18 --> 9608.819
logic yeah this [ __ ] a false

9605.58 --> 9611.58
dichotomy oh it's a dream oh you

9608.819 --> 9614.039999999999
hallucinated that means it's not logic

9611.58 --> 9616.14
that means it's not real no that's a

9614.04 --> 9618.84
bunch of [ __ ] psychiatrist pieces of

9616.14 --> 9621.479
[ __ ] atheists that are just declaring

9618.84 --> 9623.939
that any kind of spiritual experience or

9621.479 --> 9626.06
something is not real because it doesn't

9623.939 --> 9628.979000000001
fit their stupid little

9626.06 --> 9631.199999999999
non-spiritual materialistic atheist

9628.979 --> 9634.26
vision of the world yeah

9631.2 --> 9636.84
don't fall for that [ __ ]

9634.26 --> 9639.06
yeah if you have a vision that doesn't

9636.84 --> 9641.28
mean it's illogical it just means you

9639.06 --> 9642.84
have a vision it has an influence it's a

9641.28 --> 9645.62
sign you might have seen in through the

9642.84 --> 9645.62
future or something

9645.72 --> 9652.92
yeah now what to do with that

9649.38 --> 9656.699999999999
the decisions the directions you take it

9652.92 --> 9658.979
that's the key that's where logic comes

9656.7 --> 9660.720000000001
in or it stays out

9658.979 --> 9664.679999999998
that's where you

9660.72 --> 9668.24
take the challenge or you abandon it and

9664.68 --> 9668.24
you just give in to Faith

9672.359 --> 9676.140000000001
you've wrought isn't it right off yeah

9674.28 --> 9678.54
that's cool

9676.14 --> 9681.3
so was the Colorado River did you know

9678.54 --> 9686.1
that well it's fully back back and

9681.3 --> 9688.979
flowing again so yeah Rivers dry up and

9686.1 --> 9692.300000000001
then they respawn it happens all the

9688.979 --> 9692.3
time did you know that

9693.78 --> 9697.380000000001
[Music]

9695.46 --> 9699.96
now are you afraid this is one of the

9697.38 --> 9701.938999999998
more particularly predicted reverse

9699.96 --> 9703.38
biblically

9701.939 --> 9708.439
so

9703.38 --> 9708.438999999998
but yeah it's happening it's drying up

9715.979 --> 9720.0
kind of argument is that nobody can

9718.439 --> 9723.24
never flood story therefore all

9720.0 --> 9726.56
religions are true what

9723.24 --> 9726.56
like what does that even mean

9727.8 --> 9736.199999999999
that that's yeah very bad logic okay

9732.12 --> 9738.0
a religion is a set of beliefs and ways

9736.2 --> 9741.6
of doing things

9738.0 --> 9746.28
yeah that has nothing to do with a

9741.6 --> 9749.640000000001
historical or mythological background

9746.28 --> 9752.04
yeah you can have a mythological or

9749.64 --> 9755.34
historical background as part of the

9752.04 --> 9757.02
storytelling of it that can literally be

9755.34 --> 9760.26
true and could have literally happened

9757.02 --> 9762.42
not saying an idiot but it can be it's a

9760.26 --> 9764.880000000001
technical possibility yeah

9762.42 --> 9766.92
that doesn't mean that the religion of

9764.88 --> 9771.319
what they actually tell you to do and

9766.92 --> 9774.899
all that that makes any damn sense okay

9771.319 --> 9777.979
they're not tied in necessarily yeah

9774.899 --> 9781.08
something can have a very real history

9777.979 --> 9786.24
yet a very insane

9781.08 --> 9789.3
result that what they want you to do

9786.24 --> 9791.58
two different factors you're not

9789.3 --> 9793.679999999998
intricately linked

9791.58 --> 9795.92
yeah something can have a complete

9793.68 --> 9799.14
[ __ ] made-up background

9795.92 --> 9800.42
mythology that's like created or

9799.14 --> 9803.519999999999
recreated

9800.42 --> 9807.72
assembled from other things

9803.52 --> 9809.28
yet have a very very carefully refined

9807.72 --> 9813.679999999998
logical

9809.28 --> 9813.68
set of things that you're supposed to do

9813.84 --> 9820.08
as part of the religion

9816.3 --> 9823.5
they're not the same yeah just because

9820.08 --> 9825.42
the history of something of a religion

9823.5 --> 9828.62
is true doesn't make the religion

9825.42 --> 9828.62
logical or good

9829.14 --> 9835.619999999999
and just because it completely misses

9832.1 --> 9838.2
any kind of historical background like

9835.62 --> 9840.300000000001
it's really modern it's really new

9838.2 --> 9843.78
that doesn't mean that the religion

9840.3 --> 9846.72
itself cannot be very effective and good

9843.78 --> 9850.880000000001
and durable for the future those two are

9846.72 --> 9850.88
not necessarily linked yeah

9852.72 --> 9857.88
although yeah a religion will last much

9855.42 --> 9861.6
longer if both are good if the history

9857.88 --> 9865.14
is a very solid and the actions of what

9861.6 --> 9868.16
people do in the religion is very good

9865.14 --> 9868.16
and durable

9869.1 --> 9876.56
both factors are of good quality yeah

9872.34 --> 9876.56
the religion will last a lot longer

9876.66 --> 9880.68
and and even

9878.76 --> 9884.7
sit through

9880.68 --> 9887.880000000001
waves of superstitious development like

9884.7 --> 9890.399000000001
there's been many times where the West

9887.88 --> 9892.699999999999
would just get all oh we're so good oh

9890.399 --> 9896.16
and they didn't look at oh look at this

9892.7 --> 9898.859
Indians and their old religion oh that's

9896.16 --> 9900.899
so pathetic and oh look at how primitive

9898.859 --> 9903.78
they are oh we're so much better than

9900.899 --> 9907.199999999999
this right you know that happens well a

9903.78 --> 9910.220000000001
good religion sits through all that sort

9907.2 --> 9910.220000000001
of [ __ ] all the time

9910.5 --> 9915.359
because it happened civilizations they

9912.96 --> 9917.58
kind of grow up they get wealthy and

9915.359 --> 9919.979000000001
then they turn all to arrogant pieces of

9917.58 --> 9922.68
[ __ ] that think that everything else is

9919.979 --> 9927.0
too primitive for them it happens all

9922.68 --> 9929.52
the time in history all the time

9927.0 --> 9933.54
so a religion

9929.52 --> 9938.18
needs to be able to endure that

9933.54 --> 9942.859
and ignore it and still on their own

9938.18 --> 9946.319
survive and not adapt to that kind of

9942.859 --> 9951.74
dilapidation of society

9946.319 --> 9951.74
yeah only then will it be durable

9953.819 --> 9959.18
if a religion mutates and changes too

9956.939 --> 9962.58
much depending on the contemporaries

9959.18 --> 9966.84
situations of society then it's not it's

9962.58 --> 9970.8
gonna water down until it's it's dead

9966.84 --> 9972.84
and I think that that is

9970.8 --> 9975.42
in it that's kind of happening with

9972.84 --> 9977.960000000001
Christianity and has been happening for

9975.42 --> 9977.960000000001
quite a while

9979.08 --> 9985.64
I've even actually thought of that

9981.54 --> 9988.26
instead of the church the Vatican

9985.64 --> 9990.84
completely destroying and hiding an

9988.26 --> 9993.300000000001
original Bible it might be that they

9990.84 --> 9995.7
actually just presented Jesus's Bible

9993.3 --> 9998.58
originally and that the people just

9995.7 --> 10001.28
rejected it because it was too hard

9998.58 --> 10004.939
it could be that they just rewrote a

10001.28 --> 10008.359
book so that the public would be yay

10004.939 --> 10010.220000000001
yay we can be [ __ ] Devils again but

10008.359 --> 10013.0
now we're saved

10010.22 --> 10016.46
it could be that the people actually

10013.0 --> 10019.04
rejected original Christianity and it

10016.46 --> 10021.74
wasn't the Vatican that tried to hide it

10019.04 --> 10023.899000000001
they may have simply just presented it

10021.74 --> 10027.039999999999
at first and then it's like the people

10023.899 --> 10027.039999999999
just rejected it

10029.0 --> 10032.979
that could have actually happened too

10036.14 --> 10041.96
in your opinion are any of the world's

10038.96 --> 10046.06
religion actually valid

10041.96 --> 10046.06
that depends on what about it

10047.0 --> 10051.979
yes and no

10049.16 --> 10054.28
with all religions yes and no with all

10051.979 --> 10054.279999999999
of them

10058.819 --> 10063.319
right there's so many components in a

10061.22 --> 10064.819
religion and some of the components are

10063.319 --> 10068.06
very well developed with certain

10064.819 --> 10070.42
religions and very underdeveloped with

10068.06 --> 10070.42
others

10074.54 --> 10080.54
right the group component the group

10077.78 --> 10082.04
Unity Community like that the community

10080.54 --> 10085.28
Unity

10082.04 --> 10086.84
or the the thinking processes like what

10085.28 --> 10088.819000000001
are the people actually thinking about

10086.84 --> 10091.58
within it

10088.819 --> 10094.46
right or the attire like what is the

10091.58 --> 10097.16
style of the religion like do you get

10094.46 --> 10100.399
have do you have a uniform thing

10097.16 --> 10104.06
right or how is the leadership hierarchy

10100.399 --> 10108.199999999999
or like how

10104.06 --> 10110.42
is there like a business model

10108.2 --> 10112.1
for people in that religion to engage

10110.42 --> 10114.74
with the outside world to strengthen

10112.1 --> 10117.380000000001
that religion right there's all these

10114.74 --> 10119.119999999999
different factors and they all play into

10117.38 --> 10122.14
the success

10119.12 --> 10122.140000000001
of religion

10130.58 --> 10135.38
right anyway I think I'm gonna round out

10132.38 --> 10138.8
the show because man I've been

10135.38 --> 10140.599999999999
going for almost three hours again

10138.8 --> 10143.899
anyway

10140.6 --> 10147.140000000001
I'm getting kind of tired

10143.899 --> 10150.279999999999
I hope you enjoyed the show

10147.14 --> 10150.279999999999
it's very interesting

10150.38 --> 10155.358999999999
I thought

10152.359 --> 10157.399000000001
said some what's a good discussion about

10155.359 --> 10160.34
religion last part

10157.399 --> 10164.24
with lumpy gas in a vacuum genuinely not

10160.34 --> 10166.399
trying to troll and and share his views

10164.24 --> 10168.02
on it and I was glad I was able to

10166.399 --> 10171.439
respond

10168.02 --> 10174.2
to such statements

10171.439 --> 10176.479000000001
and claims without literally going

10174.2 --> 10178.76
foaming at the mouth angry because it's

10176.479 --> 10181.88
being presented like a squirt boy

10178.76 --> 10184.16
so lumping I guess I appreciate

10181.88 --> 10186.74
the things you've said

10184.16 --> 10188.78
I hope you appreciated what I've said

10186.74 --> 10190.16
too I'm gonna give you a wrench despite

10188.78 --> 10193.12
you doing

10190.16 --> 10193.119999999999
the Christian thing

10206.54 --> 10213.460000000001
I love you fair enough

10209.38 --> 10213.46
weird to say by the way but

10214.52 --> 10219.02
it's just that I am having this position

10217.22 --> 10220.699999999999
and I'm gonna keep having this position

10219.02 --> 10223.54
it's going to keep rolling out of me

10220.7 --> 10223.54
just so you know

10224.12 --> 10231.62
and if you then keep re-rolling the

10228.979 --> 10233.96
chant side of Christianity every time I

10231.62 --> 10236.54
do that eventually I will lose my

10233.96 --> 10238.699999999999
patience for that those people

10236.54 --> 10242.240000000002
even if you're nice even if you meant it

10238.7 --> 10244.880000000001
well I will lose my patience for it

10242.24 --> 10247.3
because I don't care for your good

10244.88 --> 10247.3
feelings

10248.84 --> 10254.18
I don't care it makes you feel good to

10250.88 --> 10257.0
say that it's illogical

10254.18 --> 10259.16
and I don't care that you don't care

10257.0 --> 10261.5
whether I care or not

10259.16 --> 10263.3
about it that you're so solidified in

10261.5 --> 10266.479
that you have to think in a certain way

10263.3 --> 10268.699999999999
it's wrong it's just wrong I cannot

10266.479 --> 10270.74
accept it no matter how good it makes

10268.7 --> 10273.380000000001
you feel no matter how much confidence

10270.74 --> 10275.3
it brings you no matter how more safe it

10273.38 --> 10277.339999999998
makes you feel that so many people do it

10275.3 --> 10280.819
I just it doesn't matter

10277.34 --> 10283.399
I will lose my patience eventually if

10280.819 --> 10285.5
you keep doing it

10283.399 --> 10286.64
would be a great religious leader that's

10285.5 --> 10289.3
hilarious

10286.64 --> 10289.3
but

10290.42 --> 10293.960000000001
Maybe

10291.8 --> 10296.72
I don't know

10293.96 --> 10298.899
I just know I'm very serious about these

10296.72 --> 10298.899
things

10307.28 --> 10314.859
anyway I'm rounding out

10309.8 --> 10314.858999999999
without having yelled or anything so yay
