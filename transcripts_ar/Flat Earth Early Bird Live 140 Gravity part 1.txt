Arwen and today is just amazing amazing

50.27 --> 58.59
beautiful day Sun just just right now

55.739 --> 62.97
God behind the cloud but it's been like

58.59 --> 64.32000000000001
a summer day super warm like that so I'm

62.97 --> 66.99
sitting in my t-shirt

64.32 --> 70.74
it's just sunny and really nice and warm

66.99 --> 72.78
and just crowded outside everybody's

70.74 --> 76.759
just walking outside playing outside

72.78 --> 84.77
doing stuff outside hanging outside

76.759 --> 90.66
sitting in the Sun driving around easy

84.77 --> 91.94999999999999
lots of motorcycle activity so yeah it

90.66 --> 96.869
was like a summers day

91.95 --> 101.19
at the end of March 30th so yeah good

96.869 --> 108.06
morning how are you all doing see and

101.19 --> 114.24
Glassjaw is your earlier Steve Rio chené

108.06 --> 117.39
chené please gentle eyes and psychics

114.24 --> 122.19
warrior good to see you good good to see

117.39 --> 126.51
you all mmm so yeah some things have

122.19 --> 134.01
happened I have a list again that's kind

126.51 --> 139.65
of basic though yeah see right so yeah I

134.01 --> 142.2
have been keeping busy pretty much every

139.65 --> 144.81
waking moment I spent at my computer

142.2 --> 148.95
well not every waking moment but pretty

144.81 --> 152.33
much constantly every 10 minutes or so

148.95 --> 155.91
dealing with troll comments obviously

152.33 --> 159.04000000000002
coming from simondon goody

155.91 --> 161.65
but however

159.04 --> 164.44
these trolls are not super basic I think

161.65 --> 166.39000000000001
no yeah there's some just outright

164.44 --> 168.01
spammers that we're trying to slander me

166.39 --> 173.07999999999998
I've removed them all so a lot of work

168.01 --> 175.29899999999998
still haven't and not every one of them

173.08 --> 177.37
is even reported by YouTube like I don't

175.299 --> 181.93
even get to see that they're added goody

177.37 --> 186.19
thanks thanks you too but yeah there's

181.93 --> 189.90900000000002
also some yeah just some new people that

186.19 --> 191.85999999999999
aren't troll ish at all and yeah I've

189.909 --> 198.37
got quite a lot of subscribers actually

191.86 --> 200.56
out of it 188 so I guess like 10 to 15

198.37 --> 201.579
subscribes from that so yeah thank you

200.56 --> 208.629
for subscribing

201.579 --> 211.39000000000001
I hope yeah I hope you will be able to

208.629 --> 213.849
get something out of my hangouts anyway

211.39 --> 218.79899999999998
yes because there's also some good

213.849 --> 221.98
questions why chat of course also from

218.799 --> 223.989
the regulars but in the comment section

221.98 --> 228.069
here and there in between all the

223.989 --> 230.079
control comments some to which I can

228.069 --> 234.04
respond and others which is like these

230.079 --> 236.28
giant pages of presuppositional rambling

234.04 --> 236.28
and

237.54 --> 243.92999999999998
probably copy-pasted so I usually just

239.97 --> 247.01
delete them as well don't get a nerd

243.93 --> 251.69
overkill on me please

247.01 --> 257.479
right that's something else yesterday

251.69 --> 263.79
yeah after the debates just a lot about

257.479 --> 264.93
ebon and Slick James and I was

263.79 --> 267.69
in-between there although after

264.93 --> 270.0
afterwards listening to it it sounded

267.69 --> 273.12
more like I was just disrupting it but

270.0 --> 276.84
it's weird like this microphone on

273.12 --> 278.76
Nathan's I don't get sound priority for

276.84 --> 281.09999999999997
some reasons even though I'm just on the

278.76 --> 284.76
panel just like them that was kind of

281.1 --> 287.40000000000003
disappointing so yeah I don't know why

284.76 --> 290.46
this is it's very weird because with my

287.4 --> 296.15999999999997
very basic mic I used to have tendency

290.46 --> 299.43
to actually do get priority so it is

296.16 --> 303.27000000000004
what it is anyway after the debates I

299.43 --> 306.93
went on eben zoom hangout and talked

303.27 --> 307.96999999999997
about religion a lot and that was pretty

306.93 --> 313.25
good

307.97 --> 317.639
it was a little bit more sensible not so

313.25 --> 320.52
not so attacking as it ya became on the

317.639 --> 322.02
debates and it was good so I recommend

320.52 --> 324.33
it I don't know really where to find it

322.02 --> 328.229
I probably just have to look on his

324.33 --> 331.2
channel yeah anyway zoom is a pretty

328.229 --> 333.06
good hangout system and I've used it

331.2 --> 337.11
before so I already had it installed

333.06 --> 339.13
with concerning the GTI yeah thing that

337.11 --> 342.1
I do

339.13 --> 347.8
- presentations given with zoom there as

342.1 --> 354.63
well so yeah right so and then Owen

347.8 --> 357.91
Benjamin my god poof he's just now

354.63 --> 361.0
full-on full-on attacking Alex Jones

357.91 --> 364.72
I've I didn't expect this it really

361.0 --> 367.2
feels like serious infighting but yeah

364.72 --> 376.6
due to some things that alex has said

367.2 --> 382.9
basically I think that Alex was just a

376.6 --> 387.22
little bit to do Paula gist for him so

382.9 --> 391.56
he just squeezed every little detail out

387.22 --> 395.44000000000005
of it it was a bit of overkill but yeah

391.56 --> 397.87
made sense though Owen Benjamin style

395.44 --> 401.77
but it was pretty harsh and I don't know

397.87 --> 404.37
what comes out of this we'll see what it

401.77 --> 404.37
was pretty brutal

405.61 --> 413.259
[Music]

407.36 --> 422.21000000000004
yeah check it check it out anyway but

413.259 --> 425.90000000000003
yeah yeah Joe Rogan well it probably

422.21 --> 428.87
already started out when Alex Jones

425.9 --> 434.13899999999995
apparently didn't let Owen Benjamin get

428.87 --> 436.539
back on because Owen Benjamin said that

434.139 --> 440.659
Hitler was a great leader

436.539 --> 443.81
which he explains by the way like yeah

440.659 --> 446.479
it's technically correct and at the same

443.81 --> 449.36
time he was not a good moral leader was

446.479 --> 453.409
not a good person but as a technical

449.36 --> 456.16900000000004
leader yeah it was admirable in a way

453.409 --> 459.8
and I kind of have to agree with that

456.169 --> 463.94
but yeah Alex Jones didn't take that for

459.8 --> 467.719
one bit and yeah well Alex Jones has

463.94 --> 471.139
also been using Hitler as the boogeyman

467.719 --> 473.539
in many ways and you know it's kind of

471.139 --> 477.229
logical because yeah it's very relevant

473.539 --> 479.84
right now and you live real culture as

477.229 --> 482.24
well and it's crazy all over the place

479.84 --> 484.719
as all of you know by now from all the

482.24 --> 490.069
narratives that just all went overkill

484.719 --> 492.83
but Alex Jones didn't take it and Owen

490.069 --> 496.25
Benjamin isn't let on so now Owen

492.83 --> 499.789
Benjamin it's just putting a giant

496.25 --> 504.49
magnifying glass over Alex to show every

499.789 --> 508.52
little day detail and just cowardly or

504.49 --> 511.909
wrong type of Jew thing that he's doing

508.52 --> 515.329
and yeah hopefully he he won't turn out

511.909 --> 517.959
totally burning Alex like an ant this

515.329 --> 517.959
keeps up

519.68 --> 527.9399999999999
all right um hello so I've been feeling

525.21 --> 530.34
up inside here like a stowaway oh yeah

527.94 --> 532.8900000000001
sorry I I didn't even see you or you

530.34 --> 534.4200000000001
were in yet yeah no I had issues getting

532.89 --> 536.73
into the coal and Google hangout

534.42 --> 540.6899999999999
surprisingly it's not for some reason it

536.73 --> 543.09
just doesn't like me very much so yeah

540.69 --> 547.1700000000001
it's a bit difficult for some devices to

543.09 --> 549.15
get on yes yeah good to see you likewise

547.17 --> 550.8199999999999
are you able to hear me okay yeah yeah

549.15 --> 554.9399999999999
coming through loud and clear

550.82 --> 556.86
so rs Kyle I guess it's funny

554.94 --> 559.5600000000001
yep can you just call me Kyle if you'd

556.86 --> 561.9300000000001
like all right yeah yeah you added me on

559.56 --> 564.66
skype and you wanted to talk about a few

561.93 --> 568.0999999999999
things and so I stopped no let's do it

564.66 --> 570.63
on the show yeah yeah that why not um I

568.1 --> 572.4
wish I still had my iPad to be really

570.63 --> 574.08
useful to to have like a screen share

572.4 --> 577.11
thing I could just show what I'm writing

574.08 --> 578.97
but I'm I wanted to ask about what like

577.11 --> 581.01
I was looking at a YouTube channel

578.97 --> 582.21
recently called scientifically and I was

581.01 --> 585.93
trying I'm sure you know who that is

582.21 --> 587.34
yeah cool I scientifically sorry you

585.93 --> 589.4399999999999
never heard of him never heard of him

587.34 --> 592.32
okay right well he's similar to Nathan

589.44 --> 596.22
Oakley in some ways but um I was a big

592.32 --> 598.47
statement uh honestly I'm not sure I'm

596.22 --> 600.6600000000001
quite new to the scene so okay well

598.47 --> 603.75
Nathan oakley's been at it for a long

600.66 --> 605.85
time I think I think he has brilliant a

603.75 --> 607.86
relatively an orthodox way of doing

605.85 --> 609.0600000000001
things because I was trying to ask when

607.86 --> 611.5500000000001
questions about things and he just

609.06 --> 613.8199999999999
wasn't giving a coherent answer so um I

611.55 --> 616.5
sort of just moved on after a while and

613.82 --> 620.6700000000001
the questions that I was asking him I

616.5 --> 622.11
see no reason to not ask you because I I

620.67 --> 622.4399999999999
mean you seem like you can give me an

622.11 --> 625.6800000000001
answer

622.44 --> 629.96
so right right well before we go into

625.68 --> 634.1099999999999
the material could you maybe yeah yeah

629.96 --> 635.73
exactly my apologies right well I'm so

634.11 --> 637.32
used to not doing the anonymity is such

635.73 --> 639.75
a useful thing but I'll be quite happy

637.32 --> 642.12
to you guys care whatever you you feel

639.75 --> 644.46
safe to share it just a little bit of

642.12 --> 648.84
your background yeah how you came into

644.46 --> 651.24
the scene all that and okay where you

648.84 --> 653.1
stand by the way oh right yes I forgot

651.24 --> 654.66
people won't know where I stand well I

653.1 --> 658.7900000000001
for those of you who are wondering am I

654.66 --> 661.8299999999999
am arguing against Arwen's position

658.79 --> 663.9599999999999
alright in essence I well I'm an

661.83 --> 666.45
undergraduate in university currently I

663.96 --> 668.0400000000001
study physics so as you can imagine this

666.45 --> 670.6500000000001
will be a very interesting discussion

668.04 --> 672.06
I am my position is just sort of

670.65 --> 674.97
understand where our ones coming from

672.06 --> 677.64
from his perspective of gravity and the

674.97 --> 679.34
flyer thing and just see what the deal

677.64 --> 681.63
is because I just find it interesting

679.34 --> 682.98
people have disagreements the best way

681.63 --> 685.08
to understand disagreements is to just

682.98 --> 687.6
simply ask them why so that's what I'm

685.08 --> 690.45
here to do but looking forward to it

687.6 --> 694.41
yep so yeah how did you come to the

690.45 --> 695.46
scene well I was sort of just looking

694.41 --> 697.14
through the internet I spend an

695.46 --> 699.5300000000001
inordinate amount of time doing that

697.14 --> 702.63
I saw the Netflix documentary actually I

699.53 --> 705.51
know I started thinking oh yes I had

702.63 --> 706.64
known about Jaron Jaron ism' I got my

705.51 --> 711.24
Sherpa to pronounce his name

706.64 --> 713.04
yeah Jaron from Jaron him for years and

711.24 --> 715.59
years and years I think I'd heard of him

713.04 --> 719.0699999999999
first from a another youtube channel

715.59 --> 721.6800000000001
called armored skeptic and then he did a

719.07 --> 723.1800000000001
video on him and then Jaron ism' sort of

721.68 --> 725.0999999999999
linked to somebody else and then not

723.18 --> 726.9
some deals started linked to you

725.1 --> 729.57
I've called I think it was Nathan ill

726.9 --> 730.8
click that link to you and there so you

729.57 --> 733.8900000000001
know it's just being this kind of little

730.8 --> 736.41
rabbit hole of fright some guy you got

733.89 --> 738.27
to Jaron and Jarrod to Nathan and

736.41 --> 741.03
through Nathan you found me alright

738.27 --> 743.1899999999999
makes sense yeah you just seemed like

741.03 --> 744.42
the best person to message I wasn't

743.19 --> 747.8900000000001
totally certain if I was gonna message

744.42 --> 750.51
Nathan and I might change that I might

747.89 --> 753.48
I'm I messaged him later but I'll see

750.51 --> 756.06
what happens I know that if anybody's

753.48 --> 758.52
curious that the symbol um yeah that so

756.06 --> 762.06
that that's the high location it is

758.52 --> 763.65
yeah as lambda is the symbol for

762.06 --> 766.68
wavelength as well in physics but it

763.65 --> 768.09
said yes from half-life so it's that's

766.68 --> 773.25
probably where people recognize it

768.09 --> 775.14
yeah well with the circle around it I'm

773.25 --> 777.75
not changing my accent consciously it's

775.14 --> 779.79
am i I grew up with a lot of people from

777.75 --> 783.42
a lot of different places arms to

779.79 --> 785.4
answering the chat now I grew up with

783.42 --> 786.5799999999999
people from America and from England and

785.4 --> 788.74
from Scotland and from

786.58 --> 790.9590000000001
I have everywhere around the globe I'm

788.74 --> 795.279
actually Scottish myself so you know

790.959 --> 798.16
it's just from the proper Scottish come

795.279 --> 800.56
on you have any mob can't wait to get

798.16 --> 807.2199999999999
out of my swamp for something just go

800.56 --> 808.8389999999999
for one straight good right now sorry

807.22 --> 811.72
just just getting it on yeah you

808.839 --> 815.23
probably didn't grow up for a long in

811.72 --> 817.0600000000001
Scotland right well no actually my whole

815.23 --> 818.98
life it's just I just don't believe that

817.06 --> 821.579
most of people that I talk to aren't

818.98 --> 823.8100000000001
from Scotland so it's just never really

821.579 --> 827.56
the accent it's just not something that

823.81 --> 832.5699999999999
I ended up right I just didn't develop

827.56 --> 834.6099999999999
it all right can I happen oh yeah sure I

832.57 --> 837.73
am I am pronouncing your name correctly

834.61 --> 840.13
on today's Arwen right right yeah it is

837.73 --> 843.01
as well as it can be normally pronounced

840.13 --> 845.5
in English because yeah is originally a

843.01 --> 849.8199999999999
Dutch name with a very specific Dutch

845.5 --> 851.41
foul that just doesn't work in English I

849.82 --> 855.3000000000001
was thinking that there would be like

851.41 --> 859.5889999999999
something that you couldn't do it's an A

855.3 --> 863.709
so I have an oh wow good luck with that

859.589 --> 866.8290000000001
yeah I'm quite fortunate that I have

863.709 --> 869.14
prayed pretty simple name just kale all

866.829 --> 870.55
right well I'm kind of glad actually

869.14 --> 873.73
that I have such a difficult name

870.55 --> 876.87
because nobody else out there seems to

873.73 --> 879.82
have it never found it anywhere and

876.87 --> 882.82
everybody seems to know exactly who I am

879.82 --> 885.4300000000001
also thanks to the name so it's actually

882.82 --> 887.44
worked in my favor yeah I can imagine

885.43 --> 889.3
that'd be quite useful I mean at Kyle

887.44 --> 892.5100000000001
there was like 12 people on my street

889.3 --> 895.66
named Kyle so yeah yeah and my my front

892.51 --> 897.88
name is also super basic so I'd be

895.66 --> 900.3389999999999
competing with like four others five

897.88 --> 905.769
others that are I know on the scene

900.339 --> 907.6
I just just answer the Chatham you will

905.769 --> 911.29
not guess where I'm from I'm from

907.6 --> 914.23
Glasgow believe it or not so I do not

911.29 --> 919.01
have a glossary gene accent which is I

914.23 --> 922.83
know strange all right

919.01 --> 927.21
anyway yeah let's get into the material

922.83 --> 929.3000000000001
so yeah what are your questions and or

927.21 --> 932.19
do you want to present something first

929.3 --> 933.63
how do you want to do this I want to ask

932.19 --> 935.5200000000001
you a few questions if you don't mind

933.63 --> 937.02
just to begin with that's fine namely

935.52 --> 940.41
what your opinion is an electromagnetic

937.02 --> 942.56
so do you have any I just want to

940.41 --> 944.75
understand where you're coming from so

942.56 --> 946.7099999999999
for those of you who might not know

944.75 --> 948.63
electromagnetic sand gravitational

946.71 --> 949.08
Theory actually share a hell of a lot of

948.63 --> 951.0
ground

949.08 --> 952.9200000000001
a lot of the equations and electro

951.0 --> 957.18
magnetics are very reminiscent to that

952.92 --> 959.55
of gravity so to give an example it's an

957.18 --> 961.38
air force yeah I know it's it's actually

959.55 --> 964.77
scary huh and what they aren't like that

961.38 --> 967.98
the force between two charges is given

964.77 --> 969.9
by the equation F equals k q-1 q-2 over

967.98 --> 972.4200000000001
R squared K is just a constant and

969.9 --> 975.6899999999999
whereas for gravitational theory it's F

972.42 --> 979.14
equals G which is a constant M 1 M 2 or

975.69 --> 982.0200000000001
R squared see the the similarity there

979.14 --> 985.23
this the exact same setup it's constant

982.02 --> 987.29
mass one mass 2 or atom it doesn't

985.23 --> 990.54
really scare me because I could pretty

987.29 --> 993.54
tell pretty certainly how why it is so

990.54 --> 997.41
similar it's because gravity has been

993.54 --> 1001.31
derived construct Chile from that as it

997.41 --> 1003.8
is a gravity is a phantom effect that

1001.31 --> 1006.76
ties in a lot of different operations

1003.8 --> 1015.74
and elements and it's a very useful tool

1006.76 --> 1017.93
but yeah it is not really there or at

1015.74 --> 1021.38
least not not in the form that is

1017.93 --> 1024.2
presented to us because I do kind of

1021.38 --> 1027.5
assume in a way through yeah through

1024.2 --> 1029.24
deduction logical deduction I'm not

1027.5 --> 1031.85
necessarily empirical even although

1029.24 --> 1033.98
there are empirical elements to it that

1031.85 --> 1036.4099999999999
there is a force this equilibrium

1033.98 --> 1039.76
constant present at all times you can

1036.41 --> 1043.1000000000001
deduce that at various ways I do it is

1039.76 --> 1048.26
by looking at the density buoyancy

1043.1 --> 1050.24
alignment the order by which the lighter

1048.26 --> 1051.98
and the heavier densities align

1050.24 --> 1054.89
themselves which is kind of as

1051.98 --> 1056.03
specific direction something that Nathan

1054.89 --> 1058.22
for example doesn't really like to

1056.03 --> 1060.58
address or that crowd because it's not

1058.22 --> 1063.3500000000001
needed for the relative density theory

1060.58 --> 1067.1299999999999
for the yeah scientifically proven

1063.35 --> 1069.35
theory actually and but yeah there are

1067.13 --> 1073.7900000000002
still all these aberrations like if you

1069.35 --> 1076.07
apply a force in some way like you

1073.79 --> 1079.07
accelerate a car then everything inside

1076.07 --> 1081.6789999999999
that car is going to be having a another

1079.07 --> 1084.47
force applied another force this

1081.679 --> 1086.7800000000002
equilibrium within that space due to the

1084.47 --> 1088.04
acceleration and that will cause an

1086.78 --> 1090.799
alignment shift

1088.04 --> 1092.54
so the normal rearrangement of how the

1090.799 --> 1094.809
gas has ordered themselves that

1092.54 --> 1097.3999999999999
direction is going to shift in

1094.809 --> 1100.58
accordance to the forces applied so a

1097.4 --> 1104.0
helium balloon inside the car will move

1100.58 --> 1105.4399999999998
forward and everything that's solid and

1104.0 --> 1108.11
heavy people sitting there are going to

1105.44 --> 1110.96
be pushed backward in their chair this

1108.11 --> 1114.6499999999999
is an online meant in the in the density

1110.96 --> 1117.47
buoyancy alignment access and yeah from

1114.65 --> 1120.799
if you see how that works then yeah you

1117.47 --> 1123.59
can very much widely deduce that there

1120.799 --> 1125.12
is a force this equilibrium presence and

1123.59 --> 1128.6299999999999
you can experiment with these in all

1125.12 --> 1131.6299999999999
kinds of ways but not scientifically oh

1128.63 --> 1134.66
yes you can't actually very and

1131.63 --> 1136.97
manipulate the independent variable to

1134.66 --> 1142.4
scientifically prove it so yet that is

1136.97 --> 1145.25
my my view on it sorry I'm right okay

1142.4 --> 1150.1100000000001
yeah just bear with me one second okay

1145.25 --> 1154.04
just to grab something real quick yeah

1150.11 --> 1156.2299999999998
so it's okay right so I do not ascribe

1154.04 --> 1159.71
to the matter being attracted by other

1156.23 --> 1162.38
matter and the bending of space-time is

1159.71 --> 1165.83
a fascinating concept but it is

1162.38 --> 1167.8400000000001
basically like a science fiction realm

1165.83 --> 1170.03
editor with what you could do with it

1167.84 --> 1173.99
with the assumptions you could make to

1170.03 --> 1176.96
kind of make things fit so it is a it is

1173.99 --> 1179.1200000000001
totally science fiction right so

1176.96 --> 1182.63
physical empirical proof worried

1179.12 --> 1185.389
whatsoever okay well why don't we dive

1182.63 --> 1186.7990000000002
straight and then so if your

1185.389 --> 1188.7489999999998
that you disagree with the concept of

1186.799 --> 1190.339
gravity and that it's fiction on the

1188.749 --> 1192.499
masses donut ranks that would obviously

1190.339 --> 1195.95
why you disagree with one of the most

1192.499 --> 1197.959
famous equations F equals mg the force

1195.95 --> 1199.789
and I'm not saying that because it's

1197.959 --> 1201.829
famous this is bad that you don't accept

1199.789 --> 1205.639
it I'm just saying that you people know

1201.829 --> 1208.969
it right F equals mg the force on a mass

1205.639 --> 1215.059
is given by the mass multiplied by the

1208.969 --> 1216.769
gravitational field right yeah so like I

1215.059 --> 1221.019
said in electromagnetics we have very

1216.769 --> 1223.009
very similar equations now when you take

1221.019 --> 1225.379
there's an equation called the Lorentz

1223.009 --> 1227.119
equation which gives you the force in a

1225.379 --> 1228.799
charged particle in a magnetic and

1227.119 --> 1230.9289999999999
electric field if you take away the a

1228.799 --> 1234.1689999999999
look at the magnetic field which say it

1230.929 --> 1236.5700000000002
will be zero in this example you're just

1234.169 --> 1238.7
left with the the equation F equals EQ

1236.57 --> 1240.889
which states that the force and a

1238.7 --> 1242.3890000000001
charged particle is equal to the charged

1240.889 --> 1246.829
particle multiplied by the electric

1242.389 --> 1249.7089999999998
field now my stance is if we were to

1246.829 --> 1252.889
take a constant electric field a set of

1249.709 --> 1254.209
parallel plates and apply well in order

1252.889 --> 1255.32
for the electric field to be there we

1254.209 --> 1257.5990000000002
would have to apply a voltage across

1255.32 --> 1259.6689999999999
them but our potential difference as we

1257.599 --> 1266.1789999999999
say but what we can do is we can

1259.669 --> 1267.3790000000001
actually use F equals mg - so I'm still

1266.179 --> 1268.8490000000002
reading the chat it's not doing that

1267.379 --> 1270.9499999999998
because I keep interrupting myself so

1268.849 --> 1272.749
don't read yes yeah yeah all right sorry

1270.95 --> 1275.499
sorry sorry all right so we can actually

1272.749 --> 1277.909
use the equation F equals mg to

1275.499 --> 1280.009
orientate and set up an electric field

1277.909 --> 1281.5700000000002
which keeps a particle stationary or

1280.009 --> 1287.619
well it doesn't have to be a part it can

1281.57 --> 1290.139
be a full mass what sorry I lost track

1287.619 --> 1293.839
okay sorry so all these mathematical

1290.139 --> 1296.629
formulas but I if you can please

1293.839 --> 1298.609
formulate it a little bit more about the

1296.629 --> 1301.609
actual actions that are going to be part

1298.609 --> 1305.389
of an experiment okay so because these

1301.609 --> 1308.899
the concepts are all very mad may fit if

1305.389 --> 1311.119
you rely upon them to be true but yeah

1308.899 --> 1312.559
there yeah as soon as you're gonna try

1311.119 --> 1315.649
to actually scientifically prove

1312.559 --> 1318.74
something you're gonna be put down to

1315.649 --> 1322.6999999999998
the basics of the scientific method

1318.74 --> 1325.549
so anyway go on you were trying to

1322.7 --> 1328.64
compare electrical activity to gravity

1325.549 --> 1330.679
so maybe I'll just start fully from the

1328.64 --> 1332.6000000000001
beginning and obviously you are people

1330.679 --> 1334.8500000000001
who are very very sat on the scientific

1332.6 --> 1336.4399999999998
method so I will I will go through it as

1334.85 --> 1338.1689999999999
it pertains to that there's an

1336.44 --> 1340.01
experiment in physics that we've

1338.169 --> 1341.69
basically known since the nineteen

1340.01 --> 1343.8799999999999
seventies is a very very famous

1341.69 --> 1346.01
experiment and it's called Robert

1343.88 --> 1349.0700000000002
Milliken's oil-drop experiment so what

1346.01 --> 1351.98
happens is you take a clump of charged

1349.07 --> 1355.279
mass in this case it's all you can

1351.98 --> 1358.73
actually pick anything and what you do

1355.279 --> 1360.529
is you balance the F equals mg equation

1358.73 --> 1362.69
so in other words the force on that

1360.529 --> 1365.84
particle pulling it down due to gravity

1362.69 --> 1368.8700000000001
is balanced by it could be a magnetic

1365.84 --> 1371.48
field or an electric field or both

1368.87 --> 1373.1
either one all that does is change the

1371.48 --> 1374.779
equations you'd use but you can you can

1373.1 --> 1378.23
theoretically do it with any of them

1374.779 --> 1380.27
right so what I'm saying is if mass

1378.23 --> 1382.039
doesn't attract other mass how can that

1380.27 --> 1385.8799999999999
equation be used to calibrate an

1382.039 --> 1387.74
electric or magnetic or both fields such

1385.88 --> 1390.529
that it makes a particle stationary or a

1387.74 --> 1392.27
mass stationary because I've actually

1390.529 --> 1394.01
done the experiment and I've used

1392.27 --> 1395.779
electric fields quite a lot I've done

1394.01 --> 1398.09
charge to mass ratio experiments which

1395.779 --> 1400.88
are we can get into later they're a

1398.09 --> 1402.62
little bit more elaborate okay but what

1400.88 --> 1404.96
is it you're actually trying to prove

1402.62 --> 1407.029
with that experiment or what were they

1404.96 --> 1410.3600000000001
trying to prove what is the independent

1407.029 --> 1412.399
variable here well the the variable that

1410.36 --> 1415.6689999999999
so they were trying to show the charge

1412.399 --> 1416.75
in an electron you you can it's

1415.669 --> 1418.5490000000002
complicated to go through that showing

1416.75 --> 1419.96
the mathematical derivation division but

1418.549 --> 1422.48
you can you can calculate the charge an

1419.96 --> 1423.95
electron from that you can also

1422.48 --> 1431.39
calculate the mass and electron if you

1423.95 --> 1433.13
have its mass okay so how are you

1431.39 --> 1435.409
proving gravity

1433.13 --> 1437.24
how are you manipulating gravity because

1435.409 --> 1441.2890000000002
if you're gonna use some electromagnetic

1437.24 --> 1444.169
influence yeah that's another effect

1441.289 --> 1446.779
that is causing the difference the

1444.169 --> 1449.0200000000002
manipulation the change so how are you

1446.779 --> 1452.23
actually changing gravity in

1449.02 --> 1454.929
in your experiment there's no changing

1452.23 --> 1457.15
of gravity we're just causing a particle

1454.929 --> 1458.5590000000002
to be stationary and when we make it

1457.15 --> 1461.23
stationary we can assume certain

1458.559 --> 1463.87
variables to be zero right well it it's

1461.23 --> 1467.71
pretty basic that if you apply some

1463.87 --> 1470.29
force to material that is basically

1467.71 --> 1473.71
offset in its relative density spectrum

1470.29 --> 1476.559
so normal need to displace itself down

1473.71 --> 1479.64
then ya some force can stop that some

1476.559 --> 1483.3999999999999
surface tension like a tater or a

1479.64 --> 1485.65
magnetic influence but that doesn't

1483.4 --> 1488.01
actually prove gravity well actually it

1485.65 --> 1490.51
was that force can counteract

1488.01 --> 1493.15
displacement that is a natural part of

1490.51 --> 1495.19
the relative density concept but the

1493.15 --> 1498.0700000000002
level of displacement is calculated

1495.19 --> 1500.44
using the equations that we use to

1498.07 --> 1502.8999999999999
illustrate mass and gravitational theory

1500.44 --> 1505.8400000000001
so what I'm saying is it doesn't mean

1502.9 --> 1507.6100000000001
anything really it doesn't know but it's

1505.84 --> 1509.83
all the - you know reasoning yeah the

1507.61 --> 1512.9799999999998
formulas may fit and I even argue for

1509.83 --> 1516.25
this with gravity that it is gravity is

1512.98 --> 1519.94
an oversimplification in math often

1516.25 --> 1522.78
wider systems that really functions well

1519.94 --> 1526.21
and it's very simple and it it works out

1522.78 --> 1530.32
but it's an aberration as long as you

1526.21 --> 1532.72
can very manipulative 'ti itself can't

1530.32 --> 1535.12
even really detect it not really

1532.72 --> 1537.1000000000001
okay there's all kinds of speculation

1535.12 --> 1539.32
about this and there's new devices that

1537.1 --> 1542.74
are supposedly graviton meters that's

1539.32 --> 1545.2
just total total wizardry [ __ ] in my

1542.74 --> 1547.8700000000001
personal opinion so you're after

1545.2 --> 1550.1200000000001
something like a gravitational wave like

1547.87 --> 1552.4899999999998
the electric waves because we can given

1550.12 --> 1553.809
an electric wave can be measured yeah

1552.49 --> 1557.19
that's what I'm saying you're right

1553.809 --> 1560.3799999999999
detective it has a it has a range and a

1557.19 --> 1564.46
spectrum in strength gravity has none of

1560.38 --> 1566.74
these things it's a force this

1564.46 --> 1569.559
equilibrium constant that cannot be

1566.74 --> 1572.26
detected it is just apparently there

1569.559 --> 1576.42
because that is how things work out if

1572.26 --> 1576.42
you assume that it is there

1576.92 --> 1582.6200000000001
do you understand well you see the thing

1580.52 --> 1584.84
is is that I think the science is a bit

1582.62 --> 1586.6999999999998
more nuanced than most people are happy

1584.84 --> 1588.59
with I don't actually agree with the

1586.7 --> 1592.51
principle that because we can't

1588.59 --> 1594.47
physically see a gravitational wave I

1592.51 --> 1597.77
that that's that doesn't mean it's not

1594.47 --> 1602.0
there necessarily gravitational wave

1597.77 --> 1606.62
just very noticeably influencing the

1602.0 --> 1609.14
actual strength of gravity by for

1606.62 --> 1612.08
example counteracting it not by motion

1609.14 --> 1614.48
by actually manipulating the gravity

1612.08 --> 1616.3999999999999
itself and this can't be done there's

1614.48 --> 1620.96
all kinds of things you can cook we

1616.4 --> 1624.95
displace things all that but gravity

1620.96 --> 1628.669
itself is not neutralized so it is a

1624.95 --> 1631.0
fictional force it's it that depends

1628.669 --> 1633.7700000000002
what you mean by fictional the the

1631.0 --> 1638.03
radiation apparently there everything's

1633.77 --> 1639.35
really there look scientific theories

1638.03 --> 1641.12
are just our advanced way of

1639.35 --> 1642.6789999999999
representing reality according to

1641.12 --> 1643.9399999999998
science that is always like you disagree

1642.679 --> 1645.65
but what I'm saying is is that we can

1643.94 --> 1648.89
actually calculate the force on a

1645.65 --> 1651.919
particle from gravity using an equation

1648.89 --> 1654.679
that is the precipice of gravitational

1651.919 --> 1656.8400000000001
theory and it is mathematical deduction

1654.679 --> 1658.94
so sorry but what I'm saying is that

1656.84 --> 1660.9189999999999
equation gives us a value that

1658.94 --> 1663.799
represents something in reality and

1660.919 --> 1665.8400000000001
that's something in reality yeah I know

1663.799 --> 1669.3799999999999
that the calculations pan out it

1665.84 --> 1672.32
actually works and I argue for this I

1669.38 --> 1676.49
defend gravity as a concept with this

1672.32 --> 1679.309
but you can't refer to science and how

1676.49 --> 1682.07
science deals with things because that

1679.309 --> 1685.3999999999999
is the side the scientific community or

1682.07 --> 1689.51
rather the pseudo scientific community

1685.4 --> 1691.3090000000002
the deduction is community that just try

1689.51 --> 1694.34
to figure out how things could

1691.309 --> 1696.83
potentially work but yeah there is a

1694.34 --> 1698.8999999999999
foundation tool this all really that's

1696.83 --> 1700.9399999999998
been kind of put in the corner forgotten

1698.9 --> 1703.429
about because it's so inconvenient you

1700.94 --> 1706.22
don't make a lot of headway if you

1703.429 --> 1708.679
actually apply abides by the original

1706.22 --> 1711.08
rules and that is the scientific method

1708.679 --> 1716.3300000000002
and to prove that something is actually

1711.08 --> 1719.779
a thing you need to physically somehow

1716.33 --> 1722.269
alter it manipulate it in order to be

1719.779 --> 1726.889
able to prove it that it is actually a

1722.269 --> 1730.639
thing and not something made up based on

1726.889 --> 1733.369
deductions of what happens do you

1730.639 --> 1735.4089999999999
understand um I understand what you're

1733.369 --> 1737.86
saying but I disagree with the premise I

1735.409 --> 1739.909
don't think we have to alter and change

1737.86 --> 1741.4989999999998
something in order to be able to say

1739.909 --> 1745.1000000000001
that it's it's solidly there I mean we

1741.499 --> 1747.499
can alter things that's your personal

1745.1 --> 1751.73
opinion but that is the case then you do

1747.499 --> 1753.559
not agree with the scientific method you

1751.73 --> 1755.659
rely upon pseudoscience

1753.559 --> 1757.46
I don't rely on pseudoscience and you do

1755.659 --> 1759.2890000000002
it's in there if you disagree with the

1757.46 --> 1761.24
scientific method then you rely upon

1759.289 --> 1763.039
pseudoscience that's not a component of

1761.24 --> 1764.72
the scientific method being able to

1763.039 --> 1766.129
constantly affect every single thing

1764.72 --> 1768.409
that you discuss now you have to

1766.129 --> 1770.509
manipulate your independent variable

1768.409 --> 1774.44
which is the thing you are trying to

1770.509 --> 1776.509
prove oh so you're saying that in the

1774.44 --> 1777.98
example I was giving the independent

1776.509 --> 1780.049
variable okay right I see what you're

1777.98 --> 1781.759
saying as we have you gonna date

1780.049 --> 1784.07
something else then you're not

1781.759 --> 1786.019
manipulating the thing you're trying to

1784.07 --> 1788.4189999999999
prove and that's been the problem with

1786.019 --> 1790.22
gravity for a long time every time some

1788.419 --> 1793.97
supposed experiment is going to prove

1790.22 --> 1796.549
gravity there's always a G in there the

1793.97 --> 1799.58
thing you're trying to prove but not as

1796.549 --> 1801.559
the independent variable it's never the

1799.58 --> 1804.649
independent variable it's a trick hidden

1801.559 --> 1807.23
in plain sight and it is pseudoscience

1804.649 --> 1809.7199999999998
wizardry actually we can change that

1807.23 --> 1811.909
variable constant that was referring

1809.72 --> 1814.22
because you can have a new Canadian and

1811.909 --> 1817.49
they can manipulate actually but you

1814.22 --> 1819.83
can't we can go ahead how are you gonna

1817.49 --> 1821.45
manipulate gravity go further from the

1819.83 --> 1823.759
source the inverse square law it will

1821.45 --> 1825.2
decrease the gravitational field you can

1823.759 --> 1827.029
do that what you can do is you can set

1825.2 --> 1828.95
up an experiment say just hypothetically

1827.029 --> 1830.419
speaking here right always say this

1828.95 --> 1832.519
would not be connected then you're

1830.419 --> 1838.3400000000001
manipulating your distance you're

1832.519 --> 1840.019
manipulating your position gravity that

1838.34 --> 1842.57
does manipulate the gravitational field

1840.019 --> 1844.82
no it just changes

1842.57 --> 1847.21
the position within the assumed

1844.82 --> 1849.71
gravitational field where you are

1847.21 --> 1853.07
changes your location it doesn't change

1849.71 --> 1854.27
gravity right but well I'm showing what

1853.07 --> 1855.86
you would measure in that hypothetical

1854.27 --> 1859.8799999999999
experiment you you could use it to

1855.86 --> 1861.5
measure G 9.8 meters per second per

1859.88 --> 1863.18
second or in length point 8 Newton's per

1861.5 --> 1864.47
kilogram whatever you want to call it

1863.18 --> 1867.13
that's what I'm saying you could no you

1864.47 --> 1870.23
can't prove it you can deduce it you can

1867.13 --> 1873.95
method you have a through method deduce

1870.23 --> 1876.35
it that there is potentially something

1873.95 --> 1879.05
there and the structure of that

1876.35 --> 1883.49
assumption of that deduction pans out on

1879.05 --> 1885.56
a wider scale right this doesn't prove

1883.49 --> 1889.01
it it doesn't prove that it is actually

1885.56 --> 1892.22
there because if you want to do that you

1889.01 --> 1896.45
have to manipulate it as the independent

1892.22 --> 1899.48
variable within your hypothesis I just I

1896.45 --> 1902.96
just don't get the idea of you can edit

1899.48 --> 1904.28
the sole thing ergo it's not a thing

1902.96 --> 1907.01
like I just don't understand what you're

1904.28 --> 1908.48
saying because we can illustrate it you

1907.01 --> 1910.19
can change the code a tional field via

1908.48 --> 1911.75
moving obviously you didn't like that

1910.19 --> 1914.03
because it's you're not changing that

1911.75 --> 1916.13
the field directly you're changing the

1914.03 --> 1917.6299999999999
changing your position that would be

1916.13 --> 1919.7600000000002
akin to me saying that we can change the

1917.63 --> 1921.65
electric field by changing the voltage

1919.76 --> 1922.67
between two plates and then you say no

1921.65 --> 1923.8700000000001
you're not actually changing the

1922.67 --> 1926.1200000000001
electric field you're changing the

1923.87 --> 1928.1
voltage and then me saying but that is

1926.12 --> 1929.75
what's causing the electric field it's

1928.1 --> 1932.6299999999999
right there you can move that the

1929.75 --> 1936.05
electric field exists in that case good

1932.63 --> 1937.3700000000001
talk for you but how is that not the

1936.05 --> 1941.3
same thing that I'm doing with the

1937.37 --> 1943.7299999999998
gravitational field gravitational field

1941.3 --> 1946.3899999999999
you're not changing it well you're not

1943.73 --> 1949.57
very you're just changing your position

1946.39 --> 1953.39
it's like saying okay I'm gonna

1949.57 --> 1955.85
experiment on some hypothesis involving

1953.39 --> 1958.0700000000002
a rock now I'm gonna manipulate this

1955.85 --> 1960.4099999999999
rock so I'm basically gonna drop this

1958.07 --> 1962.54
rock walk over a few miles pick up a

1960.41 --> 1965.18
bigger Rock see now I manipulated my

1962.54 --> 1966.11
independent variable no you just

1965.18 --> 1968.8700000000001
relocated

1966.11 --> 1971.33
you didn't actually change the rock you

1968.87 --> 1973.6399999999999
just picked up another one but though

1971.33 --> 1975.81
it's not manipulating the imperfect

1973.64 --> 1978.5400000000002
rogue we're not trying to prove that

1975.81 --> 1981.54
cific it's just an example I know I know

1978.54 --> 1983.1299999999999
I know but it doesn't hold up well you

1981.54 --> 1984.69
say you're gonna change your position

1983.13 --> 1987.96
and there's going to be other elements

1984.69 --> 1989.91
there then you're not literally

1987.96 --> 1991.92
manipulating the independent variable

1989.91 --> 1993.99
you're just changing your location where

1991.92 --> 1996.8100000000002
things are different but there aren't

1993.99 --> 1999.66
how do I put this that there are lots of

1996.81 --> 2002.09
things that we can this arbitrary set of

1999.66 --> 2004.49
you have to always change and vary the

2002.09 --> 2006.25
independent variable it breaks down so

2004.49 --> 2008.9
much when you go into things that are

2006.25 --> 2010.55
one would not just gravity but going

2008.9 --> 2011.69
into quantum theory there are certain

2010.55 --> 2014.48
things you can't change

2011.69 --> 2015.8
yeah that mean they're not scientific

2014.48 --> 2017.69
and that doesn't mean there aren't

2015.8 --> 2022.34
rigorous and aren't applicable to be

2017.69 --> 2025.79
used in theories oh I'm not saying you

2022.34 --> 2027.53
can theorize about it but but not really

2025.79 --> 2030.02
really get to the point where you can

2027.53 --> 2032.69
empirically deduce certain things I do

2030.02 --> 2034.76
it myself to get some progress in

2032.69 --> 2037.04
overseeing what is actually out there

2034.76 --> 2039.56
because that's what science and the

2037.04 --> 2041.8999999999999
scientists the spirit of science you

2039.56 --> 2044.69
could say is trying to do is figure out

2041.9 --> 2046.73
the world understand it better but if

2044.69 --> 2049.01
you actually want to claim science

2046.73 --> 2051.38
there's just very strict rules to it and

2049.01 --> 2053.2400000000002
if you don't abide by those rules then

2051.38 --> 2055.46
you're basically either empirically

2053.24 --> 2057.6499999999996
deducing or if you're not basing it on

2055.46 --> 2059.96
actual observations about just on

2057.65 --> 2064.1800000000003
presuppositions and assumptions then you

2059.96 --> 2067.82
deal in the realm of pure theory

2064.18 --> 2069.29
everything in the realm of your theory

2067.82 --> 2070.8500000000004
there is no such thing that has ever

2069.29 --> 2073.4
dealt with outside of pure theory the

2070.85 --> 2075.95
idea every concert and no there's no

2073.4 --> 2078.9500000000003
every Alliance has to be Mary's I like

2075.95 --> 2082.46
the outer vacuum of space and what

2078.95 --> 2087.1299999999997
supposedly still endures away all of

2082.46 --> 2093.13
that which is based at most on a very

2087.13 --> 2096.77
tiny bit of observation of some light

2093.13 --> 2101.4100000000003
viewed with the wider telescope that's

2096.77 --> 2104.39
it it's a huge amount of presupposition

2101.41 --> 2106.8799999999997
if you break anything down to find

2104.39 --> 2108.6099999999997
enough degree it's inferred it will be

2106.88 --> 2111.4900000000002
infer from our vision

2108.61 --> 2113.77
it's not it it doesn't make it invalid

2111.49 --> 2115.75
and on top of that these rules that

2113.77 --> 2118.92
you're saying it's simply completely

2115.75 --> 2121.18
omitted from every scientific theory

2118.92 --> 2123.64
sorry to interrupt you but if you want

2121.18 --> 2125.62
nobody actual signs are listen please if

2123.64 --> 2130.45
you want to get your science you have to

2125.62 --> 2134.0099999999998
first get empirical and that means you

2130.45 --> 2136.81
have to actually confirm things like

2134.01 --> 2139.5400000000004
physicality that it's really a thing

2136.81 --> 2141.75
well you don't even get to that step you

2139.54 --> 2145.48
just have light and then you base

2141.75 --> 2147.85
certain deductions of what kind of

2145.48 --> 2150.4900000000002
material supposedly is there based on

2147.85 --> 2155.98
the light spectrum what you receive and

2150.49 --> 2159.37
this is all done very selectively trying

2155.98 --> 2162.97
to suggest a logical hierarchy or

2159.37 --> 2164.5299999999997
structure but it is just speculation and

2162.97 --> 2166.8399999999997
none of it is really confirmed

2164.53 --> 2169.21
none of the physicality aspects have

2166.84 --> 2171.7200000000003
been actually confirmed are you

2169.21 --> 2175.09
referring to emission spectra that like

2171.72 --> 2179.5299999999997
all these distant galaxies and and Suns

2175.09 --> 2182.05
that start our Suns even and yeah even

2179.53 --> 2184.2400000000002
with the planets although yeah those the

2182.05 --> 2188.01
wandering stars and their supposed moons

2184.24 --> 2192.1299999999997
those are well really phenomenally

2188.01 --> 2194.3500000000004
mysterious celestial observations like

2192.13 --> 2197.77
based observations which I don't yeah

2194.35 --> 2199.54
they are quite mine baffling but still

2197.77 --> 2202.0
there's no confirmation of anything

2199.54 --> 2203.71
physical about them what would you what

2202.0 --> 2205.51
would you say is confirmation what would

2203.71 --> 2211.93
you want as confirmation what would be

2205.51 --> 2214.48
your ideal parameters would you oh okay

2211.93 --> 2217.21
could it get a bit more like do you mean

2214.48 --> 2219.22
like no you're talking abut approach

2217.21 --> 2221.29
your varying the independent variable

2219.22 --> 2224.29
like you referring to that again like is

2221.29 --> 2226.3
it would you want how would you want to

2224.29 --> 2227.65
change that if take a mission of space

2226.3 --> 2229.8100000000004
well you have to confirm that it's

2227.65 --> 2233.32
physical because the scientific method

2229.81 --> 2235.57
also only really deals with the natural

2233.32 --> 2237.61
and physical world so you have to first

2235.57 --> 2240.04
confirm that the things involved are

2237.61 --> 2242.02
physical in the first place so yeah you

2240.04 --> 2246.1
need to approach it

2242.02 --> 2249.61
approachability is a deductible simple

2246.1 --> 2251.77
element you can use to deduce that it is

2249.61 --> 2255.9100000000003
potentially physical if you can approach

2251.77 --> 2258.91
it then there is a great chance it's not

2255.91 --> 2261.49
even guaranteed that it is in a specific

2258.91 --> 2263.77
location and you could go there and then

2261.49 --> 2266.95
to actually confirm it you have to go

2263.77 --> 2270.33
there and get samples to get material to

2266.95 --> 2274.87
confirm that it is physical but yeah

2270.33 --> 2278.68
approach it if you do that then you have

2274.87 --> 2283.45
a sign an element that could lead to a

2278.68 --> 2287.6499999999996
physical nature these limitations and

2283.45 --> 2291.73
parameters seem to be awfully helpless I

2287.65 --> 2295.09
mean not strict note unorthodox

2291.73 --> 2298.06
they seem slightly I disagree I think

2295.09 --> 2301.3
they are ultra-orthodox well no think

2298.06 --> 2304.09
they are the original Orthodox method

2301.3 --> 2307.6000000000004
that's it's not an Arthur it's not most

2304.09 --> 2311.7400000000002
unorthodox its Orthodox it is exactly

2307.6 --> 2313.18
Orthodox what I'm saying is that it's a

2311.74 --> 2315.1899999999996
little bit more with the scientific

2313.18 --> 2317.9199999999996
method it does vary from accounts and

2315.19 --> 2321.6
it's not as no straight no doesn't there

2317.92 --> 2325.21
there may be other methods applied on

2321.6 --> 2328.0899999999997
top of the scientific method like for

2325.21 --> 2330.61
example the complex hypothesis which can

2328.09 --> 2334.57
be very complex but thing about a

2330.61 --> 2337.96
complex hypothesis is that all the

2334.57 --> 2340.9300000000003
variables have to be first proven to be

2337.96 --> 2344.34
real using the basic scientific method

2340.93 --> 2346.3599999999997
so every element has to be proven first

2344.34 --> 2348.19
otherwise for them if you're going to

2346.36 --> 2349.9
use things that aren't proven like for

2348.19 --> 2351.73
example gravity always have it on the

2349.9 --> 2355.87
side never is independent variable yeah

2351.73 --> 2357.9900000000002
then you're entering pseudoscience what

2355.87 --> 2360.46
what I'm saying is is that your

2357.99 --> 2363.1299999999997
definition of proven is seemingly

2360.46 --> 2364.93
independent from what and almost any

2363.13 --> 2368.53
major Research Institute that I've been

2364.93 --> 2370.2999999999997
a part of will give you and I know but

2368.53 --> 2372.61
sad isn't it you don't think that that's

2370.3 --> 2375.04
what but they're not the ones that are

2372.61 --> 2375.98
sad there are one yeah that'd be

2375.04 --> 2378.39
constant

2375.98 --> 2380.73
science and they get all the money that

2378.39 --> 2381.93
election going so they'll make up

2380.73 --> 2384.66
whatever they can

2381.93 --> 2386.16
whatever is expected of them just to

2384.66 --> 2390.21
keep the funds going it's totally

2386.16 --> 2392.25
logical it's a corporation what do you

2390.21 --> 2396.2400000000002
mean by it's a corporation most of these

2392.25 --> 2398.94
are nonprofit Institute's right and all

2396.24 --> 2401.06
that wonderful they don't get their

2398.94 --> 2403.29
money for free they actually have to

2401.06 --> 2405.5099999999998
entice more members and that they have

2403.29 --> 2406.92
to there are certain criteria they have

2405.51 --> 2410.76
to fulfill why don't I give you an

2406.92 --> 2413.46
example they do dance and then they'll

2410.76 --> 2416.82
get their funding and they have to bring

2413.46 --> 2419.2200000000003
forth projects and concepts that are in

2416.82 --> 2422.1600000000003
the interest of either the wider public

2419.22 --> 2424.35
or the rulers that have the money so

2422.16 --> 2428.1
they'll be very inclined to follow

2424.35 --> 2431.2799999999997
theories and concepts and realms of

2428.1 --> 2432.81
thinking that are popular with those

2431.28 --> 2434.4300000000003
that will fund them because if they're

2432.81 --> 2437.54
actually going to get really

2434.43 --> 2440.6099999999997
controversial they'll go in the ditch

2437.54 --> 2441.7799999999997
that's always been take a look at what

2440.61 --> 2443.9700000000003
happened with Einstein's theory of

2441.78 --> 2445.8900000000003
special and general relativity but not a

2443.97 --> 2448.1699999999996
lot of it of course they did it gave

2445.89 --> 2450.75
them no three-year reign if they loved

2448.17 --> 2452.9700000000003
it so much like everything all right

2450.75 --> 2454.44
it's total dynamic now what they loved

2452.97 --> 2458.52
it so much why didn't they give him the

2454.44 --> 2459.96
Nobel Prize for it I have no idea it

2458.52 --> 2461.49
didn't because it was controversial

2459.96 --> 2463.59
whenever something comes out in science

2461.49 --> 2465.45
the main move thing the thing that moves

2463.59 --> 2466.53
science forward is innovation it's

2465.45 --> 2468.66
coming up with something that goes

2466.53 --> 2470.2200000000003
against what the presupposed thought the

2468.66 --> 2472.5299999999997
right wouldn't you've considered was

2470.22 --> 2474.5699999999997
that is sometimes they don't make it at

2472.53 --> 2476.55
the time but you know pretty damn well

2474.57 --> 2478.7400000000002
that Einstein is practically being

2476.55 --> 2480.9900000000002
worshipped now by the pseudo scientific

2478.74 --> 2483.5899999999997
community even though back then they

2480.99 --> 2486.12
sort of had a common worship dignity and

2483.59 --> 2488.55
actually see it as pseudoscience and

2486.12 --> 2491.3599999999997
just put him aside but not the case

2488.55 --> 2494.88
anymore Einstein is the most well known

2491.36 --> 2498.03
scientists in the world right now do you

2494.88 --> 2499.9500000000003
realize this no I I don't really care

2498.03 --> 2501.51
either because isn't it true isn't he

2499.95 --> 2504.8399999999997
the most widely known

2501.51 --> 2506.88
used in cartoons used in movies records

2504.84 --> 2509.04
yeah I would be happy to agree with you

2506.88 --> 2511.6800000000003
there right honestly

2509.04 --> 2514.08
get a lot of glory even though he might

2511.68 --> 2516.2999999999997
have not wanted noble now yeah when this

2514.08 --> 2518.7
theory kima it wasn't he was not given

2516.3 --> 2520.52
the Nobel Prize for and he was not there

2518.7 --> 2524.27
were so many things because

2520.52 --> 2528.48
pseudoscience it was not citizens

2524.27 --> 2531.42
it was absolutely I guess I must have a

2528.48 --> 2534.39
theory was pure science fiction none of

2531.42 --> 2537.42
it was proven in any way it's all

2534.39 --> 2540.0299999999997
theoretical all mathematical theoretics

2537.42 --> 2541.9500000000003
if we worship Einstein why do we accept

2540.03 --> 2544.17
quantum mechanics because Einstein did

2541.95 --> 2545.1899999999996
not like quantum mechanics he did not

2544.17 --> 2549.78
like it one bit

2545.19 --> 2552.03
people always wanted Delvon move find

2549.78 --> 2554.61
their own unique opposition opposition

2552.03 --> 2556.59
to whatever was there so we worship Him

2554.61 --> 2559.44
we want to move on and don't go with

2556.59 --> 2562.77
what he says that things are quite a lot

2559.44 --> 2565.55
of people worship their their father for

2562.77 --> 2568.92
example and then do the exact opposite

2565.55 --> 2571.4700000000003
career-wise or whatever or philosophical

2568.92 --> 2574.86
wise or political wise but they will

2571.47 --> 2577.02
still highly respect their dad or I

2574.86 --> 2579.21
don't hate him really badly or whatever

2577.02 --> 2585.42
but yet that doesn't mean anything

2579.21 --> 2588.0
that's just how people go go ahead and

2585.42 --> 2591.03
find a region to delve in and quantum

2588.0 --> 2594.27
mechanics very theoretical was just a

2591.03 --> 2596.4300000000003
new region and Einstein just I don't

2594.27 --> 2598.29
know just to address the point that was

2596.43 --> 2600.21
made earlier because you just brought up

2598.29 --> 2602.64
again when you said very theoretical

2600.21 --> 2606.44
yeah I clearly you were using the

2602.64 --> 2606.44
colloquial definition of Theory correct

2607.07 --> 2613.65
sorry I'm casual right yeah there's two

2612.03 --> 2615.2400000000002
definitions of theory there's scientific

2613.65 --> 2616.86
theory and then a more what we call

2615.24 --> 2618.4199999999996
colloquial I'm using the words that was

2616.86 --> 2619.59
used in the champ because well the

2618.42 --> 2620.82
reason I'm changing the subject was

2619.59 --> 2622.08
because somebody brought it up and I

2620.82 --> 2622.65
wanted to address it because there's a

2622.08 --> 2624.39
good point

2622.65 --> 2626.7000000000003
I've clearly misunderstood the point you

2624.39 --> 2628.79
made earlier as somebody's point you

2626.7 --> 2630.75
stated that it's just a theory

2628.79 --> 2632.4
obviously misunderstood that I thought

2630.75 --> 2635.34
you were referring to scientific theory

2632.4 --> 2636.9
right that was my scientific so no I

2635.34 --> 2637.32
know I know but that's that was my

2636.9 --> 2641.67
mistake

2637.32 --> 2642.59
right it's easily made don't worry about

2641.67 --> 2647.58
it

2642.59 --> 2650.6000000000004
so yeah where were we or is there

2647.58 --> 2655.29
another question you would like to ask

2650.6 --> 2658.65
anything um no I reckon that's about it

2655.29 --> 2660.27
alright well thank you well yeah it was

2658.65 --> 2662.4
good it was good

2660.27 --> 2664.89
yeah likewise yeah really nice to be

2662.4 --> 2668.58
here yeah you definitely feel as a

2664.89 --> 2670.65
well-studied person with integrity and

2668.58 --> 2674.0699999999997
even though you're like kind of on the

2670.65 --> 2676.44
baller side right now I felt this was

2674.07 --> 2678.7200000000003
all true you weren't trying to be

2676.44 --> 2681.3
manipulative or anything and you really

2678.72 --> 2684.1499999999996
listened and I appreciate it and I hope

2681.3 --> 2687.2400000000002
you will give it some some thought over

2684.15 --> 2690.75
time and think yeah the things I've said

2687.24 --> 2692.1299999999997
maybe watch Mike absolutely I like why I

2690.75 --> 2694.26
said I hope that we can both learn

2692.13 --> 2696.06
something from that so well I'd love to

2694.26 --> 2699.4500000000003
talk to you indeed and yeah I do

2696.06 --> 2701.91
appreciate everything you've said even

2699.45 --> 2705.2999999999997
though I basically went against it in

2701.91 --> 2708.69
the moment because I myself at one point

2705.3 --> 2711.69
try to prove that scientifically that

2708.69 --> 2713.37
science could be yeah that is real I

2711.69 --> 2716.7000000000003
spent quite a lot of time actually

2713.37 --> 2720.39
defending that in the debates like a

2716.7 --> 2723.06
year ago now so that's why I know about

2720.39 --> 2725.79
its entire structure and how suggestive

2723.06 --> 2727.74
it really is but yeah they they got me

2725.79 --> 2732.15
in the end with just the scientific

2727.74 --> 2734.2799999999997
method that's it right that's how it

2732.15 --> 2736.82
works but yeah I do you were right about

2734.28 --> 2741.8100000000004
a lot of things and I totally get that

2736.82 --> 2744.6000000000004
why you believe in gravity because it

2741.81 --> 2746.34
the system just works so well it works

2744.6 --> 2749.67
brilliantly it works in almost

2746.34 --> 2752.04
everything and that makes it very

2749.67 --> 2756.36
appealing it makes it an appealing tool

2752.04 --> 2757.95
to work with so I get that and I

2756.36 --> 2761.13
wouldn't shy away from that necessary

2757.95 --> 2763.47
I'm not like gravity allergy type did ya

2761.13 --> 2765.96
that's by the way a thing in Michael oh

2763.47 --> 2768.0
yeah there's gravity allergy and I've

2765.96 --> 2769.56
actually protested it like what why do

2768.0 --> 2772.35
you guys have again I give you the

2769.56 --> 2774.39
example though I wanted to give I hate I

2772.35 --> 2775.31
hate talking stuff about people but this

2774.39 --> 2777.92
guy I just

2775.31 --> 2779.66
understand it right he wasn't a flat

2777.92 --> 2782.7200000000003
earther so I mean you've got that going

2779.66 --> 2783.7999999999997
for you he was a scientifically guy I've

2782.72 --> 2785.87
just never found out he wasn't he's not

2783.8 --> 2787.76
a fighter third but um he's one of those

2785.87 --> 2789.71
exact people with the gravity allergy

2787.76 --> 2792.53
thing I mean he thinks that that gravity

2789.71 --> 2795.41
is electrical I I spent about 10 minutes

2792.53 --> 2796.5400000000004
just trying to understand his point it

2795.41 --> 2799.16
was Oh

2796.54 --> 2801.08
odd and peculiar I was trying to but

2799.16 --> 2803.33
there's no charge in these particles yet

2801.08 --> 2805.61
they're moving they're being pre toward

2803.33 --> 2808.37
something that it is it is very weird

2805.61 --> 2810.02
I've run into that and actually well

2808.37 --> 2812.39
that's why I turned out like pro

2810.02 --> 2816.23
graphics for our time because that's

2812.39 --> 2819.52
exactly what I bumped into with yeah the

2816.23 --> 2822.17
most of the disk errs I call them the

2819.52 --> 2825.7
flat earthers that have made a decision

2822.17 --> 2828.32
on the model and then yeah so

2825.7 --> 2830.87
scientifically reason and structure

2828.32 --> 2833.6200000000003
further trying to account for gravity

2830.87 --> 2835.8399999999997
using electrostatics for dielectric

2833.62 --> 2838.8199999999997
acceleration all these things and I

2835.84 --> 2841.94
protested against it back then because I

2838.82 --> 2844.01
said like look you it doesn't have the

2841.94 --> 2845.96
same elements every time electricity or

2844.01 --> 2848.6600000000003
magnetics or anything is involved like

2845.96 --> 2850.9700000000003
that there are there's residue there is

2848.66 --> 2854.99
measurable things about them and nothing

2850.97 --> 2858.7999999999997
about this stable apparent force this

2854.99 --> 2860.2999999999997
equilibrium we assume is gravity has any

2858.8 --> 2863.27
of these elements to it and it's

2860.3 --> 2865.9700000000003
notorious for it it's undetectable ax T

2863.27 --> 2869.87
it's just there or it just a pair it is

2865.97 --> 2871.64
apparently there and yeah flat earthers

2869.87 --> 2874.52
didn't respond well to that and I called

2871.64 --> 2878.0
even called baller she'll for it at a

2874.52 --> 2880.16
time so I know exactly what you mean

2878.0 --> 2883.1
there there is still a lot of problems

2880.16 --> 2886.16
with misunderstanding gravity or trying

2883.1 --> 2887.66
to replace it in a in a way that just

2886.16 --> 2892.04
doesn't really that's not really

2887.66 --> 2893.45
honestly real yeah it's kind of

2892.04 --> 2896.9
replacing it with another piece of

2893.45 --> 2898.97
pseudoscience so much if it's still a

2896.9 --> 2902.75
lot to be learned a lot to be figured

2898.97 --> 2904.85
out in that regard like what is what is

2902.75 --> 2906.13
causing this apparent force this

2904.85 --> 2909.069
equilibrium

2906.13 --> 2911.079
and how could you even begin to try and

2909.069 --> 2913.39
find out really like how can you

2911.079 --> 2915.119
actually manipulate this apparent

2913.39 --> 2919.589
gravity can it be done

2915.119 --> 2923.1600000000003
who knows where well it's just I'm still

2919.589 --> 2925.69
strange to hear that somebody doesn't

2923.16 --> 2928.0589999999997
consider the I understand you were

2925.69 --> 2930.489
talking a moment ago the equation is

2928.059 --> 2932.529
they fat they felt with reality

2930.489 --> 2936.64
the gravitational fields and the masses

2932.529 --> 2938.109
they all work together but your problem

2936.64 --> 2940.6299999999997
is that there's no there's no physical

2938.109 --> 2943.299
aspect to it is as you said a fictitious

2940.63 --> 2946.69
force metric they're gonna call it a

2943.299 --> 2949.599
gravitational field so how is it a field

2946.69 --> 2954.16
because fields are measurable and it's

2949.599 --> 2955.539
just assumed to be a field which we can

2954.16 --> 2957.069
measure but it's not and the ways that I

2955.539 --> 2959.829
don't think you would appreciate I don't

2957.069 --> 2961.299
think you would know that's hundred I

2959.829 --> 2963.13
don't know what I meant what I meant was

2961.299 --> 2965.44
I don't think you like that I think that

2963.13 --> 2966.549
you want a tangible thing like a tangent

2965.44 --> 2968.289
lines dealing with an electric field

2966.549 --> 2970.359
whereas where the gravitational field my

2968.289 --> 2973.1800000000003
illustration of that and being able to

2970.359 --> 2976.029
assure that it changes is moving it like

2973.18 --> 2977.799
a mast a certain distance away that's

2976.029 --> 2981.7
that's what I meant by that

2977.799 --> 2984.88
I didn't mean proof it's not it doesn't

2981.7 --> 2989.2889999999998
work it's very suggestible but not just

2984.88 --> 2991.869
actually work it it acts over a a white

2989.289 --> 2993.67
breadth and is proportionate to the

2991.869 --> 2995.65
inverse-square longest weaker as you go

2993.67 --> 2998.17
out all of these things are the same as

2995.65 --> 3000.869
in electric fields they share almost

2998.17 --> 3004.739
every property only gravity actually can

3000.869 --> 3008.9990000000003
measure it we can only deduce it that is

3004.739 --> 3013.289
measuring it not measuring it is actual

3008.999 --> 3014.9689999999996
sensing it not but deducing the methods

3013.289 --> 3017.9100000000003
through which we sense things are just

3014.969 --> 3020.5190000000002
as peculiar and just as detached almost

3017.91 --> 3022.499
from reality as the methods that I'm

3020.519 --> 3023.7889999999998
giving here that the moving something

3022.499 --> 3025.4689999999996
out further and further away proving

3023.789 --> 3028.529
it's a field proofing it fits every

3025.469 --> 3030.69
little thing again with like electric

3028.529 --> 3033.269
fields it's but without the actual

3030.69 --> 3035.9990000000003
elements to prove that it is a field the

3033.269 --> 3037.3489999999997
detectable part it's all deduction

3035.999 --> 3039.9599999999996
physical parts Oh

3037.349 --> 3045.17
deduction based it's all theoretical

3039.96 --> 3045.17
there is no measurable element to it

3045.95 --> 3052.74
sorry sorry that I still disagree

3050.609 --> 3056.0699999999997
okay well that's that's fine if you

3052.74 --> 3059.9399999999996
don't want to go there pretty certain of

3056.07 --> 3061.4700000000003
what I'm saying so yeah could we just

3059.94 --> 3063.15
take my mate go through and answer

3061.47 --> 3065.25
questions from the chat if that's okay

3063.15 --> 3067.29
oh sure if you want to go into chat for

3065.25 --> 3068.67
a moment so yeah as I keep seeing

3067.29 --> 3070.05
questions being brought up and I I feel

3068.67 --> 3071.64
like I'm desperate to answer them but

3070.05 --> 3075.05
all right or at least do mention the

3071.64 --> 3077.1299999999997
name by the way oh of course that

3075.05 --> 3082.5600000000004
sometimes I can't tell what you're what

3077.13 --> 3084.869
you're serious it's a one from Shane

3082.56 --> 3087.0
Walter a force proportionate to mass yet

3084.869 --> 3090.839
the larger mass falls at the same speed

3087.0 --> 3094.28
well yeah I see we have two equations

3090.839 --> 3096.2999999999997
here at F equals mg an F equals MA

3094.28 --> 3099.3900000000003
meaning that if you look at the

3096.3 --> 3102.2400000000002
equations they actually balance out you

3099.39 --> 3104.16
can go mg equals MA and then cancel out

3102.24 --> 3106.3799999999997
the masses so the acceleration will be

3104.16 --> 3109.14
equal to the gravitational fields pool

3106.38 --> 3111.9900000000002
what I'm saying is the force acts over a

3109.14 --> 3116.0989999999997
mass and the amount of mass affects the

3111.99 --> 3119.7
force applied to it okay but the

3116.099 --> 3122.46
acceleration felt also acts over mass

3119.7 --> 3125.31
meaning that if you have two kilograms

3122.46 --> 3127.859
and that in a gravitational field that

3125.31 --> 3129.54
will fall the same as as one kilogram

3127.859 --> 3131.97
because the force that you're applying

3129.54 --> 3134.79
yes is greater to the to kilograms but

3131.97 --> 3137.1189999999997
in order to get it to accelerate there's

3134.79 --> 3140.91
a greater require a requirement of force

3137.119 --> 3142.65
did you see what I'm saying I know

3140.91 --> 3145.02
that's not a great explanation I'm sorry

3142.65 --> 3146.7000000000003
just doing this on the fly and it is

3145.02 --> 3148.8
extraordinarily difficult to illustrate

3146.7 --> 3153.4199999999996
this with a with like a whiteboard or

3148.8 --> 3155.76
something guess we can look for some

3153.42 --> 3157.83
more questions and I said it was it

3155.76 --> 3160.849
again it was a shame Walter s wants to

3157.83 --> 3160.8489999999997
ask us anything else

3165.4 --> 3168.19
in Oakley was in the China at one point

3166.87 --> 3172.0
I'm not sure if that was him or or

3168.19 --> 3173.8
perhaps a spife but he was talking about

3172.0 --> 3177.87
quantum mechanics I'd love to hear his

3173.8 --> 3179.77
opinion on quantum mechanics here is I

3177.87 --> 3181.45
can't click on names in this I'm not

3179.77 --> 3186.7599999999998
sure if that that's actually him or

3181.45 --> 3189.04
somebody else mm-hmm okay well if

3186.76 --> 3190.8900000000003
anybody else has any questions I'd be

3189.04 --> 3193.5099999999998
quite happy to do my best

3190.89 --> 3195.3599999999997
we did actually discuss quantum

3193.51 --> 3201.1200000000003
mechanics recently on the debates

3195.36 --> 3201.1200000000003
od was yesterday or the day before and

3203.07 --> 3208.9900000000002
the understanding of it of it all is

3206.05 --> 3212.5600000000004
still very difficult and complex and

3208.99 --> 3215.35
that came for yeah that was made very

3212.56 --> 3217.95
apparent by that discussion we had about

3215.35 --> 3227.04
it and the John was there too I think

3217.95 --> 3229.93
but yeah I I have tendencies to say that

3227.04 --> 3234.43
that a lot about the quantum mechanics

3229.93 --> 3237.19
is based on like a micro physicality

3234.43 --> 3240.21
assumption bias principle where

3237.19 --> 3243.4500000000003
everything is particle eyes into units

3240.21 --> 3246.91
and I think that is a mistake and that

3243.45 --> 3249.85
that is what bred the necessity for

3246.91 --> 3252.2799999999997
quantum mechanics to come into being

3249.85 --> 3253.69
well the necessity for quantum mechanics

3252.28 --> 3256.98
was to do with the and the double slit

3253.69 --> 3260.53
experiment that was relased exactly and

3256.98 --> 3262.87
if you're going to start assuming that

3260.53 --> 3267.3700000000003
they are all particles that light or

3262.87 --> 3270.31
electricity is particles yeah then

3267.37 --> 3272.29
quantum mechanics comes into being it's

3270.31 --> 3276.0099999999998
a trick cuz I don't think they are

3272.29 --> 3278.65
particles well it's how well it's little

3276.01 --> 3282.3300000000004
bit more complicated nothing is a verily

3278.65 --> 3285.1
the same definition as a how to put this

3282.33 --> 3288.46
we call them quantum particles I know

3285.1 --> 3291.7
that sounds a bit like it was not an

3288.46 --> 3294.76
article the word article means basically

3291.7 --> 3297.49
a unit it will separate a unit

3294.76 --> 3299.4100000000003
so in essence the answers can be

3297.49 --> 3301.2099999999996
quantified so if you

3299.41 --> 3303.759
let's just give no example if you have a

3301.21 --> 3305.65
particle then you'll have one particle

3303.759 --> 3308.289
or two particles you'll never have

3305.65 --> 3308.88
one-and-a-half particles do you

3308.289 --> 3312.7000000000003
understand

3308.88 --> 3316.779
mm-hmm right so that is very important

3312.7 --> 3318.64
to keep in mind when it is being assumed

3316.779 --> 3321.819
that something is a particle so for

3318.64 --> 3326.6189999999997
example we discussed Nathan and me about

3321.819 --> 3330.67
how light being detected with a certain

3326.619 --> 3334.6600000000003
degree and then the minimum amount which

3330.67 --> 3337.1800000000003
can be absorbed yeah and then detected

3334.66 --> 3340.5989999999997
by the detector is assumed to be a

3337.18 --> 3342.6699999999996
separate particle a particle of light

3340.599 --> 3344.7400000000002
because what the idea is I'm not

3342.67 --> 3346.96
finished if you decrease the intensity

3344.74 --> 3349.0589999999997
it would no longer register but I asked

3346.96 --> 3352.2400000000002
him specifically so what if you amp up

3349.059 --> 3356.7400000000002
the amount of light energy to exactly

3352.24 --> 3359.4399999999996
one and a half will there still be one

3356.74 --> 3362.319
particle or will there be a slightly

3359.44 --> 3364.15
bigger particle and he never answered

3362.319 --> 3365.92
that question because if that is the

3364.15 --> 3368.859
case then light is not a particle it's

3365.92 --> 3372.2200000000003
not it's just a quantity it's a coin

3368.859 --> 3374.92
it's like a pool it's not a separate

3372.22 --> 3376.8089999999997
unit the issue is is that there's such a

3374.92 --> 3378.609
thing as the quantization of energy how

3376.809 --> 3380.4100000000003
you're measuring this energy is is a bit

3378.609 --> 3381.369
awkward to do it's not it's not as

3380.41 --> 3383.89
simple as you'd think

3381.369 --> 3388.0
all right well I agree look energy

3383.89 --> 3390.39
spectrum ample I'm down but a particle

3388.0 --> 3393.73
that is a separate thing that is

3390.39 --> 3396.339
molecular theory it is inherent to

3393.73 --> 3398.92
matter specifically and I think that

3396.339 --> 3400.8089999999997
light does not fall into the category of

3398.92 --> 3404.4700000000003
matter and neither do does electricity

3400.809 --> 3408.3390000000004
neither do electrons same thing goes for

3404.47 --> 3411.3999999999996
that and I don't assume they are like

3408.339 --> 3414.8089999999997
molecules or like going back that move

3411.4 --> 3417.2200000000003
no I think their other type of phenomena

3414.809 --> 3419.65
what I wanted to say was then nobody in

3417.22 --> 3422.3489999999997
science that I'm aware of at uni or any

3419.65 --> 3424.9
other Institute would ever say that the

3422.349 --> 3427.63
photons are protons or neutrons are one

3424.9 --> 3429.309
or the other particles or waves but we

3427.63 --> 3431.109
call them quantum particles for a reason

3429.309 --> 3432.73
they act as particles in certain

3431.109 --> 3433.2999999999997
situations with like the photoelectric

3432.73 --> 3435.19
effect

3433.3 --> 3436.3900000000003
there may on a commission sorry I feel

3435.19 --> 3438.52
like I'm throwing things out but I'm

3436.39 --> 3439.5699999999997
just saying this is these are reasons as

3438.52 --> 3441.67
to why and people can look they're

3439.57 --> 3443.86
something they want why we call them

3441.67 --> 3445.2400000000002
particles under certain situations and

3443.86 --> 3447.2200000000003
why occasionally we teach them as

3445.24 --> 3448.8999999999996
particles to avoid this very

3447.22 --> 3451.0899999999997
conversation because it's so complicated

3448.9 --> 3452.44
to go through yeah when we have some

3451.09 --> 3454.05
when we have stuff like the double slit

3452.44 --> 3456.37
experiment they obviously act as waves

3454.05 --> 3458.4100000000003
we're trying to bridge the gap but it's

3456.37 --> 3460.0
not an easy task and it more evident

3458.41 --> 3462.67
that doesn't make any sense because

3460.0 --> 3463.06
waves travel through a medium heck so

3462.67 --> 3464.53
weird

3463.06 --> 3468.61
it doesn't make any sense at all it's

3464.53 --> 3470.3500000000004
very very strange it's um but that's

3468.61 --> 3472.27
just what happens like we maybe it's not

3470.35 --> 3474.5499999999997
a wave maybe it's just every fractured

3472.27 --> 3476.2599999999998
set of beams well you know what you're

3474.55 --> 3478.8700000000003
welcome to publish that and in a

3476.26 --> 3480.76
scientific journal sure somebody would

3478.87 --> 3482.68
assist me because I probably on my own

3480.76 --> 3485.1400000000003
not be capable of doing that because

3482.68 --> 3487.33
that's the point it's a standard stuff

3485.14 --> 3488.68
do we for people well the idea of the

3487.33 --> 3491.0499999999997
scientific journal is that you know the

3488.68 --> 3492.73
editor looks through it and goes is this

3491.05 --> 3495.28
correct is this correct is this bad

3492.73 --> 3497.95
physics is this good physics and and

3495.28 --> 3500.8900000000003
then the scrutiny is unleashed and all

3497.95 --> 3503.2
the the peer reviewing and then it

3500.89 --> 3506.5899999999997
depends on what the mindset is of the

3503.2 --> 3510.0
average scientist priest or whatever if

3506.59 --> 3512.59
it's going to be stamped as this is [ __ ]

3510.0 --> 3514.54
throw in the garbage can take away his

3512.59 --> 3517.08
license blah blah blah or if they're

3514.54 --> 3519.82
gonna be like um hmm you might be right

3517.08 --> 3521.5
so it all depends on the atmosphere

3519.82 --> 3523.9
really what's gonna happen with that

3521.5 --> 3525.88
well it's um it's usually a bit more

3523.9 --> 3527.83
complicated than just what the attitude

3525.88 --> 3529.4500000000003
thinks because if the editor disagrees

3527.83 --> 3532.15
with the paper and it says not to

3529.45 --> 3534.1299999999997
publish it he has to issue a reason to

3532.15 --> 3536.5
the university and the university can

3534.13 --> 3538.78
disagree with them albeit if enough

3536.5 --> 3541.39
answers do that if enough editors go I'm

3538.78 --> 3543.73
not publishing this paper take

3541.39 --> 3544.9
Einstein's relativity example if if

3543.73 --> 3547.48
enough papers go yeah we're not gonna

3544.9 --> 3550.05
published your sorry if enough journals

3547.48 --> 3551.77
go we're not gonna publish your paper

3550.05 --> 3553.69
there's an issue there because

3551.77 --> 3558.34
eventually as you stated Einsteins now

3553.69 --> 3560.9500000000003
the most famous scientist of all time

3558.34 --> 3563.1400000000003
though according to you well thanks to

3560.95 --> 3565.0099999999998
the media that's the media yeah well

3563.14 --> 3567.2
either glorified him they made

3565.01 --> 3569.78
nitin but that's the that's the exact

3567.2 --> 3571.25
same people look up to him in average

3569.78 --> 3573.0800000000004
everyday life they they consider him a

3571.25 --> 3574.64
very intelligent individual and if

3573.08 --> 3577.19
somebody told you that ank's my Zen

3574.64 --> 3579.3199999999997
journal doesn't like Einstein who thinks

3577.19 --> 3581.18
that he's wrong and won't publish any of

3579.32 --> 3582.32
his stuff well what's the average person

3581.18 --> 3583.91
gonna think of that journal they're

3582.32 --> 3587.1800000000003
gonna think they're absolute morons and

3583.91 --> 3589.1
that's the point of innovation in

3587.18 --> 3592.79
science it's a structured such that if

3589.1 --> 3594.23
you repeatedly prevent scientists from

3592.79 --> 3595.94
advancing forward and moving science

3594.23 --> 3597.77
forward' solely off of the principle

3595.94 --> 3600.26
that it disagrees with perhaps something

3597.77 --> 3603.59
else at some sort of money orientated

3600.26 --> 3607.88
ideology up with global warming it'll

3603.59 --> 3609.59
take away the thinking of a large of a

3607.88 --> 3611.36
yeah of potentially large amounts of

3609.59 --> 3614.57
people the way of thinking from a

3611.36 --> 3617.8700000000003
certain real from a certain direction to

3614.57 --> 3622.79
another direction the railing setups

3617.87 --> 3624.89
plans for the world because that's also

3622.79 --> 3627.17
an aspects the social engineering that's

3624.89 --> 3630.7999999999997
well what are the oligarchs the

3627.17 --> 3632.9900000000002
controllers gonna allow to be out there

3630.8 --> 3634.3700000000003
but you're supposed controllers are

3632.99 --> 3635.75
actually ironically controlled by the

3634.37 --> 3637.6099999999997
very people that they're supposed to be

3635.75 --> 3639.29
oppressing the scientists are publishing

3637.61 --> 3640.85
in the journals are also the ones who

3639.29 --> 3642.65
constitute the University and bring it

3640.85 --> 3644.87
enough money in order for it to grow and

3642.65 --> 3646.2200000000003
expand and the thing is the universities

3644.87 --> 3647.87
are the ones who pay the scientific

3646.22 --> 3649.49
journals along occasionally with the

3647.87 --> 3650.6
government if but that the amount from

3649.49 --> 3652.58
the government is minuscule in

3650.6 --> 3654.95
comparison to the funds from scientific

3652.58 --> 3657.65
research organizations so when you say

3654.95 --> 3659.48
that they're the ones that are eschewing

3657.65 --> 3661.9100000000003
and doing dodgy stuff that that's not

3659.48 --> 3663.94
really a functional hypothesis they're

3661.91 --> 3667.22
just from my own experience I'm not

3663.94 --> 3669.05
hypothesis here no what no hold on hold

3667.22 --> 3672.3799999999997
on there's a difference between the Oly

3669.05 --> 3675.26
karke controllers that's social engineer

3672.38 --> 3676.73
society and just universities and the

3675.26 --> 3679.5800000000004
people that function on them because

3676.73 --> 3682.52
they're just trying to keep it rolling

3679.58 --> 3687.5299999999997
trying to keep it stable but yeah Olli

3682.52 --> 3690.05
Kirk's absolutely do [ __ ] they they

3687.53 --> 3694.07
influence look how the schools have been

3690.05 --> 3697.78
changed due to money influences to giant

3694.07 --> 3700.2400000000002
funds yeah funding group

3697.78 --> 3703.21
to basically take over schools and

3700.24 --> 3705.1
change everything around that kind of

3703.21 --> 3709.03
that happens that also happens in

3705.1 --> 3711.52
universities so the only car yeah

3709.03 --> 3713.6800000000003
usually they just like leave it whatever

3711.52 --> 3715.81
but then when it becomes interesting for

3713.68 --> 3717.97
them they actually manipulate the hell

3715.81 --> 3720.91
out of it with a lot of money this

3717.97 --> 3724.39
happens everywhere in the Western world

3720.91 --> 3726.3399999999997
at least yeah I'm not gonna disagree

3724.39 --> 3727.99
that the school system is is horrendous

3726.34 --> 3730.6000000000004
at the moment even in the UK I mean we

3727.99 --> 3731.83
have our own and sort of independent

3730.6 --> 3734.35
from the rest of the world system for

3731.83 --> 3738.39
for educating people but it's it's but

3734.35 --> 3743.11
they're doing it knowingly to block

3738.39 --> 3747.64
development to people from everything on

3743.11 --> 3749.05
and clearing up their minds in I I think

3747.64 --> 3750.91
that's where we disagree I actually

3749.05 --> 3752.5600000000004
think people are just really lazy like

3750.91 --> 3755.29
the current attitude in school is to

3752.56 --> 3756.49
prepare you for exams and that we say

3755.29 --> 3758.47
this at university all the time you know

3756.49 --> 3759.85
the skills prepare for exams and then

3758.47 --> 3761.7099999999996
we're here we're trying to prepare you

3759.85 --> 3763.86
for actual real-world scenarios and

3761.71 --> 3765.9700000000003
using things like the scientific method

3763.86 --> 3767.7400000000002
but the reason as to why people just get

3765.97 --> 3769.87
taught to memorize facts I didn't fly

3767.74 --> 3771.37
time in school it's just because it's

3769.87 --> 3773.2599999999998
easier for the teacher to teach it that

3771.37 --> 3775.15
way than it is for going through you

3773.26 --> 3777.5200000000004
know every example known to man and I

3775.15 --> 3779.23
feel like it's just it's just laziness I

3777.52 --> 3780.46
don't think there's a needle conspiracy

3779.23 --> 3782.68
behind that a genius

3780.46 --> 3784.27
or just really you know how much

3782.68 --> 3788.9199999999996
pressure is put on teachers these days

3784.27 --> 3790.24
oh yeah no I'm cool was that don't I

3788.92 --> 3791.7400000000002
mean I came from a school that didn't

3790.24 --> 3793.75
have a physics teacher I had to self

3791.74 --> 3795.22
teach physics oh [ __ ] you know if you if

3793.75 --> 3796.87
you can imagine perhaps this is

3795.22 --> 3799.3599999999997
different that the stress is greater and

3796.87 --> 3800.65
teachers on in different countries like

3799.36 --> 3803.65
America because I know that's a

3800.65 --> 3805.51
for-profit system in the Netherlands

3803.65 --> 3808.1800000000003
there's always trouble with teachers

3805.51 --> 3809.8900000000003
always has been it's becoming worse they

3808.18 --> 3813.66
have to regularly protest because

3809.89 --> 3816.49
they're being totally overburdened and

3813.66 --> 3818.89
ya have to do too many things and that's

3816.49 --> 3820.66
just as basic demand it's ridiculous how

3818.89 --> 3824.0499999999997
it works and it's being kept that way

3820.66 --> 3826.8399999999997
and in the meantime there's just crazy

3824.05 --> 3829.549
politicization sneaking in at the same

3826.84 --> 3832.9590000000003
time while these teachers just try to

3829.549 --> 3834.979
managed to survive working like that

3832.959 --> 3836.8689999999997
yeah it's crazy out there

3834.979 --> 3838.3089999999997
oh yeah other I'm not saying there

3836.869 --> 3839.719
aren't teachers that I've met that will

3838.309 --> 3841.099
literally go to the ends of the earth

3839.719 --> 3843.259
for you like I've certainly had teachers

3841.099 --> 3845.6890000000003
like that or just under constant stress

3843.259 --> 3847.029
right and if I can't handle that yeah

3845.689 --> 3849.8289999999997
you're gonna get lazy

3847.029 --> 3852.559
that's logical but at any cost like the

3849.829 --> 3855.4990000000003
sister that just made it insane yeah I

3852.559 --> 3858.7690000000002
mean the guy right what I was doing in

3855.499 --> 3861.229
Scotland we have three layers of exams

3858.769 --> 3862.4289999999996
we have what what you guys I think I

3861.229 --> 3865.1589999999997
don't know what you guys doing that

3862.429 --> 3866.989
Alan's but it's like GCSEs but we call

3865.159 --> 3870.1690000000003
them national fives then we have

3866.989 --> 3873.439
national sixes national sevens so it's

3870.169 --> 3876.319
it's like this the three layers okay not

3873.439 --> 3878.359
fives you do to get into net sixes and

3876.319 --> 3880.459
then you use those to get into you knees

3878.359 --> 3882.409
you can also do a national seven if you

3880.459 --> 3884.899
want but it's not it's usually just if

3882.409 --> 3886.219
you're repeating an exam you can do a

3884.899 --> 3887.449
national seven along with it or

3886.219 --> 3889.329
something else it's like a more

3887.449 --> 3892.189
complicated version of a national six

3889.329 --> 3893.119
and it usually just means hey look I

3892.189 --> 3894.769
could do this

3893.119 --> 3896.239
higher me or something like that you

3894.769 --> 3898.2189999999996
know get me into uni I can do all of

3896.239 --> 3899.509
this look I'm better than the other guy

3898.219 --> 3900.649
who can only do national sexist you know

3899.509 --> 3903.469
that's the idea but you don't really

3900.649 --> 3905.479
need them goody great

3903.469 --> 3906.649
but I am my national five is national

3905.479 --> 3908.989
six is I didn't have a teacher for

3906.649 --> 3911.8889999999997
physics when I swapped schools and went

3908.989 --> 3914.2690000000002
and did my national seven in physics I

3911.889 --> 3916.6690000000003
did have a teacher and that teacher was

3914.269 --> 3917.8089999999997
fantastic and he goes through and hunts

3916.669 --> 3921.0789999999997
through the scientific method all the

3917.809 --> 3922.639
time but that was the example that I got

3921.079 --> 3924.079
of gravity although I never asked him

3922.639 --> 3925.819
about gravity the example of the

3924.079 --> 3928.579
parallel electric plates and the

3925.819 --> 3930.229
gravitational force being used to

3928.579 --> 3931.279
calibrate the plate and then suspending

3930.229 --> 3932.779
the mass in the middle you know the

3931.279 --> 3935.149
first example I gave at the start of the

3932.779 --> 3938.329
livestream that was taken from his class

3935.149 --> 3940.489
so you know there's people on both ends

3938.329 --> 3941.949
of the spectrum here but I don't think

3940.489 --> 3945.199
that both ends of the spectrum can be

3941.949 --> 3946.7290000000003
actioned if you have a conspiracy where

3945.199 --> 3948.799
there is people trying to purposefully

3946.729 --> 3950.359
mislead people in science or and then

3948.799 --> 3953.989
schools are trying to purposefully

3950.359 --> 3957.549
promote you know well I'm sorry to share

3953.989 --> 3959.9700000000003
this with you but it's true it has been

3957.549 --> 3964.41
difficult I'm

3959.97 --> 3967.8599999999997
okay politics often just screws around

3964.41 --> 3971.16
with school systems to force people into

3967.86 --> 3974.25
a certain way of being so it has

3971.16 --> 3977.3999999999996
happened before historically empires

3974.25 --> 3979.86
especially but just States when yes

3977.4 --> 3982.6800000000003
switching around subtly manipulating the

3979.86 --> 3984.65
school system or the knowledge base or

3982.68 --> 3989.75
what should be taught or what not and

3984.65 --> 3993.36
yeah they don't have a lot of priority

3989.75 --> 3996.03
truly letting their people wisen up

3993.36 --> 3998.55
because the politic the politicians and

3996.03 --> 4000.8300000000004
the people with a lot of money they've

3998.55 --> 4004.07
become more focused on just trying to

4000.83 --> 4006.2
maintain control and their wealth and if

4004.07 --> 4009.17
a lot of people really wisen up in this

4006.2 --> 4013.04
age of technology then they'll be

4009.17 --> 4016.13
outdone it's just grown do you think

4013.04 --> 4020.06
that you you your argument presupposes

4016.13 --> 4022.73
that keep keeping people ignorant is

4020.06 --> 4025.64
supposedly an advantageous economic

4022.73 --> 4026.96
thing whereas in actuality innovation is

4025.64 --> 4029.48
one of the biggest drivers of our

4026.96 --> 4031.9700000000003
economy he's so I don't know man I mean

4029.48 --> 4034.22
I think I could disagree well there are

4031.97 --> 4036.23
more forces that want to propel us

4034.22 --> 4037.73
forward and innovate than there are that

4036.23 --> 4039.23
ones holds us back and I think that the

4037.73 --> 4042.8
ones want to hold us back are usually

4039.23 --> 4048.11
people who have look science fiction is

4042.8 --> 4052.1600000000003
a massive source of literature the right

4048.11 --> 4054.9500000000003
it's all fiction there are points it's

4052.16 --> 4058.3399999999997
still a lot though it's very amusing

4054.95 --> 4061.37
it's not real that's the trick

4058.34 --> 4063.6800000000003
it's busying therapy misleading and then

4061.37 --> 4066.5
let the people fool around with it you

4063.68 --> 4069.83
know like can you think of it as planets

4066.5 --> 4072.56
in space and aliens in it you know it's

4069.83 --> 4076.8199999999997
been it's being encouraged it's made

4072.56 --> 4079.64
popular fiction because it keeps people

4076.82 --> 4081.44
busy a lot but yeah at the same time

4079.64 --> 4083.93
while they dwell on science fiction

4081.44 --> 4086.03
concepts they don't wisen up to what's

4083.93 --> 4088.22
actually going on around them and how

4086.03 --> 4089.96
the world really works you use the

4088.22 --> 4091.1899999999996
example of science fiction you have to

4089.96 --> 4092.6
keep in mind that the only reason it's

4091.19 --> 4093.829
why it's such a big industry as it is is

4092.6 --> 4095.45
because we accept this for

4093.829 --> 4096.619000000001
action we weren't fully aware that it's

4095.45 --> 4098.75
fiction I mean you take a look at Star

4096.619 --> 4101.21
Trek one of the examples I love giving

4098.75 --> 4104.27
this example is guy walks into the space

4101.21 --> 4105.38
station thing that was oh yeah talks

4104.27 --> 4107.27
about the engine or something of the

4105.38 --> 4109.219
starship and the guy goes oh yeah we got

4107.27 --> 4111.290000000001
our new Heisenberg denilla fire

4109.219 --> 4112.7300000000005
that's the joke it's meant to be to

4111.29 --> 4115.31
prevent the Heisenberg principle of

4112.73 --> 4116.718999999999
uncertainty causing problems for photons

4115.31 --> 4119.9890000000005
knock electrons that we can't measure

4116.719 --> 4121.94
them and the guy goes oh that's very

4119.989 --> 4124.759
interesting how does your Heisenberg D

4121.94 --> 4126.619
nullifier work because we haven't

4124.759 --> 4127.969
developed one in reality we've no idea

4126.619 --> 4131.259
how it would work in the guy responds

4127.969 --> 4131.259
very well thank you

4132.849 --> 4137.0
wouldn't hold up obviously if somebody

4135.02 --> 4138.5
if somebody asked me that in a lab I'd

4137.0 --> 4141.199
get through it at the lab faster than

4138.5 --> 4144.199
you know faster than anyone else

4141.199 --> 4148.759
probably for them right if they ever

4144.199 --> 4151.0689999999995
wanted to give birth a a nonfiction

4148.759 --> 4153.52
version of that concept they'd have to

4151.069 --> 4157.25
think of some very complex

4153.52 --> 4161.540000000001
electromagnetic specific vacuum special

4157.25 --> 4164.659
plasma setup thingy to actually theorize

4161.54 --> 4167.239
how that is pretty much pretty much now

4164.659 --> 4169.58
happy magician you into believing it

4167.239 --> 4171.709999999999
there is a guy in the church experiment

4169.58 --> 4173.389
very quickly sorry to jump away from the

4171.71 --> 4175.549
subject but I've seen this asked a lot

4173.389 --> 4179.929
somebody asked him this is guy called

4175.549 --> 4182.359
tank great Robert the guy who found bone

4179.929 --> 4184.25
marrow and Dino bone which destroyed the

4182.359 --> 4186.7390000000005
notion of millions of years he was fired

4184.25 --> 4188.839
and ostracized and the only paper that

4186.739 --> 4191.15
I'm aware of and dinosaur bones

4188.839 --> 4195.5
Kuang quote is the paper by dr. Mary

4191.15 --> 4197.54
Schweitzer who well basically found what

4195.5 --> 4200.3
we call a hemoglobin breakdown products

4197.54 --> 4202.159
it wasn't blunt it was just consistently

4200.3 --> 4203.4490000000005
misconstrued as bone marrow and then

4202.159 --> 4205.73
blood and then everything else in

4203.449 --> 4206.96
between but I'm not sure if this is the

4205.73 --> 4209.419999999999
right paper because you're referring to

4206.96 --> 4211.42
a guy dr. Mary Schweitzer is a girl

4209.42 --> 4213.7390000000005
obviously so I know that could just be a

4211.42 --> 4215.09
you know Chinese whispers right you're

4213.739 --> 4217.73
one person tell us another person and

4215.09 --> 4220.67
then little details are lost so but um

4217.73 --> 4222.86
there is no paper that found Dino bone

4220.67 --> 4224.2390000000005
marrow or Dino blood or anything the

4222.86 --> 4226.849999999999
paper that I'm referring to actually

4224.239 --> 4228.83
even issued an addendum stating

4226.85 --> 4230.18
this isn't blood this is just the

4228.83 --> 4233.66
breakdown products of Bloods

4230.18 --> 4234.950000000001
this is very different sorry if I feel

4233.66 --> 4236.75
like I'm I'm pushing away from the

4234.95 --> 4237.86
general discussion but um I felt like

4236.75 --> 4239.6
that was a really good question to

4237.86 --> 4242.24
answer because people use illustrations

4239.6 --> 4244.820000000001
like that to support your argument which

4242.24 --> 4246.65
is that Sciences is an untrustworthy

4244.82 --> 4248.0
source or the scientific journals really

4246.65 --> 4250.879999999999
I should really say actually is an

4248.0 --> 4254.06
untrustworthy source yeah that's right I

4250.88 --> 4255.650000000001
took the moment to take a bite I could

4254.06 --> 4257.570000000001
give me the name that would be great I

4255.65 --> 4259.07
can do a lot with names I can figure out

4257.57 --> 4259.94
where the paper is or even the name of

4259.07 --> 4280.849999999999
the paper that would be even better

4259.94 --> 4289.339999999999
actually yeah Internet already still

4280.85 --> 4290.150000000001
there oh I think your back stream - yeah

4289.34 --> 4294.2300000000005
thank God

4290.15 --> 4299.54
oh dear my internet connection broke

4294.23 --> 4305.9
again but yeah that's not great no it's

4299.54 --> 4307.61
it's my landline certain moment I don't

4305.9 --> 4309.41
know where you cut out then I the the

4307.61 --> 4311.389999999999
dank guy didn't have a name for us

4309.41 --> 4315.17
I was I was giving him an example of a

4311.39 --> 4316.610000000001
of a paper and now he didn't have a name

4315.17 --> 4321.08
for the paper so I'm assuming that was

4316.61 --> 4322.5199999999995
just made-up nonsense 7 too much of that

4321.08 --> 4324.58
nowadays I mean if you if you're if

4322.52 --> 4328.25
you're going to cite a paper and say hey

4324.58 --> 4329.87
XYZ thing does the XY z-- that thing you

4328.25 --> 4332.27
need to give me the name of the paper at

4329.87 --> 4334.82
least because in that case if you don't

4332.27 --> 4336.830000000001
it you know they imagine if I came on

4334.82 --> 4338.9
here and just said oh yeah gravity is

4336.83 --> 4340.46
real because of this paper and they

4338.9 --> 4342.139999999999
never gave you the link to the paper and

4340.46 --> 4343.25
I never told you the name of the paper

4342.14 --> 4346.01
and refused to tell you anything about

4343.25 --> 4349.85
it you know that would be pretty

4346.01 --> 4351.29
annoying yeah - the answer on the show

4349.85 --> 4352.400000000001
can you talk more about the analogy

4351.29 --> 4353.9
between knowing there is a force

4352.4 --> 4356.299999999999
surrounding the electron and a force

4353.9 --> 4358.67
surrounding mass well the electron we

4356.3 --> 4360.53
can take as an example yeah with the

4358.67 --> 4365.18
example I gave at the start of the show

4360.53 --> 4366.7699999999995
it was a a charged mass but we could do

4365.18 --> 4369.83
a charged electron that works perfectly

4366.77 --> 4374.72
fine in essence what we have to do is

4369.83 --> 4377.75
take an electric field and take a an

4374.72 --> 4379.610000000001
electron in this case so I know the mass

4377.75 --> 4382.18
in an electron off by heart and I have

4379.61 --> 4385.82
conducted the experiments to confirm it

4382.18 --> 4387.62
it the mass of an electron is nine point

4385.82 --> 4389.87
one one times 10 to the power of

4387.62 --> 4392.47
negative 31 kilograms is really really

4389.87 --> 4395.0
really small it's tiny

4392.47 --> 4397.070000000001
now the charge on an electron is much

4395.0 --> 4398.93
much greater than that it's one point

4397.07 --> 4401.36
six times ten to power of negative 19

4398.93 --> 4405.7300000000005
coulombs so as you can imagine that's

4401.36 --> 4409.25
much much much bigger than the the mass

4405.73 --> 4411.709999999999
so what we do with these two values is

4409.25 --> 4414.77
we can calculate the force on the

4411.71 --> 4416.12
electron using F equals mg this is a

4414.77 --> 4417.8
gravitational equation that's a

4416.12 --> 4420.29
component of gravitational theory and

4417.8 --> 4423.05
has been for a long time and as Arwen

4420.29 --> 4425.9
said all of the equations fit that was

4423.05 --> 4427.28
my point yes you know this is why I

4425.9 --> 4429.139999999999
didn't want to give the example of an

4427.28 --> 4431.87
electron already somebody said this

4429.14 --> 4433.9400000000005
guy's isolated an electron no I I

4431.87 --> 4436.28
haven't I'm giving this isn't that's my

4433.94 --> 4439.37
cloud by the way so you might wanna

4436.28 --> 4442.5199999999995
sorry ace my cloud look I mean it's kind

4439.37 --> 4444.349999999999
of a troll okay somebody wanted to give

4442.52 --> 4446.93
me some somebody gave me an example

4444.35 --> 4448.58
using an electron obviously we can't

4446.93 --> 4450.17
literally use an electron that's why at

4448.58 --> 4452.75
the start the presentation I said charge

4450.17 --> 4454.67
mass it's you know you can't really

4452.75 --> 4459.26
observe an electron on its own it's not

4454.67 --> 4460.52
really a thing an article yeah well is

4459.26 --> 4462.17
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle

4460.52 --> 4465.110000000001
kind of comes into play and causes

4462.17 --> 4466.7
problems but with F equals mg we can

4465.11 --> 4469.099999999999
basically calculate the force applied

4466.7 --> 4470.33
you to gravity which you guys just be

4469.1 --> 4472.46
obviously but that's not the point

4470.33 --> 4475.13
calculating this force we can then use

4472.46 --> 4476.81
the Force to calibrate the electric

4475.13 --> 4479.0
field and then when we pop the charged

4476.81 --> 4482.120000000001
particle whatever it may be the electron

4479.0 --> 4484.55
proton whatever it will stay still

4482.12 --> 4487.55
it will stay totally motionless because

4484.55 --> 4489.110000000001
we balanced it as we wanted pair of the

4487.55 --> 4490.9400000000005
theory of gravity showing those

4489.11 --> 4493.219999999999
equations work now I understand the

4490.94 --> 4494.33
Arwen never disputed that that was where

4493.22 --> 4495.89
I was sort of

4494.33 --> 4498.38
because some people do dispute it some

4495.89 --> 4499.55
people don't but that was the example

4498.38 --> 4500.84
that I gave at the start of the stream

4499.55 --> 4503.6
if that's what you wanted me to

4500.84 --> 4506.21
illustrate then yeah by the way we have

4503.6 --> 4511.1900000000005
been joined by peanuts Clark Oh pleasure

4506.21 --> 4514.6
to meet you peanuts Clark yeah I got I

4511.19 --> 4517.549999999999
got Kyle here on the Hangout talking

4514.6 --> 4520.31
science and math are mostly just math

4517.55 --> 4522.2
really in physics theory but yeah it's

4520.31 --> 4527.18
been good so far I have a good

4522.2 --> 4531.44
discussion yeah man he throwing around a

4527.18 --> 4533.92
lot of big words and he is fascinating

4531.44 --> 4537.53
without listening to him defend this

4533.92 --> 4539.3
right well he knows the structures right

4537.53 --> 4542.509999999999
yeah nothing with that and yeah they do

4539.3 --> 4546.08
function and I kind of agree to that but

4542.51 --> 4548.0
yeah it is in a in a mystical realm of

4546.08 --> 4551.39
pseudoscience and that doesn't mean that

4548.0 --> 4554.9
it's completely nonsense but still just

4551.39 --> 4557.93
just Falls slightly outside of the the

4554.9 --> 4560.42
reach of the scientific method so goes

4557.93 --> 4566.12
into ampere called the duction area at

4560.42 --> 4569.51
best but yeah it's amazing how well it

4566.12 --> 4573.07
all seems to work out it's been very

4569.51 --> 4575.81
carefully figured out and designed as

4573.07 --> 4579.049999999999
they went as they went along it's

4575.81 --> 4581.96
interesting how it works but yeah I keep

4579.05 --> 4585.650000000001
reminding him of the the baseline facts

4581.96 --> 4587.99
and that is that that that's pretty much

4585.65 --> 4591.969999999999
as far as I'm gonna go because I do have

4587.99 --> 4594.88
respect for it for the insight and the

4591.97 --> 4599.45
how it all fits together it is very

4594.88 --> 4602.2
remarkable but yeah then what usually

4599.45 --> 4604.76
tends to happen with astronomers and

4602.2 --> 4608.51
science fiction speculators is that they

4604.76 --> 4610.900000000001
take all these all this sis all these

4608.51 --> 4613.67
systems together and then start to

4610.9 --> 4617.599999999999
fantasize about how everything's super

4613.67 --> 4620.47
far away how it applies to all that so

4617.6 --> 4623.240000000001
they build a giant is science the

4620.47 --> 4625.25
empirical science pseudoscience based

4623.24 --> 4628.219999999999
science fiction

4625.25 --> 4629.75
world where they have this oversight of

4628.22 --> 4632.150000000001
how it is supposed to be structured

4629.75 --> 4635.9
according to all their formulas and yeah

4632.15 --> 4638.0
that is what what makes it right that's

4635.9 --> 4640.15
what makes it just stealing but just

4638.0 --> 4642.65
like while I was listening to him

4640.15 --> 4645.74
it seems like he's under the assumption

4642.65 --> 4649.25
that all these scientists have this free

4645.74 --> 4652.01
range of doing whatever they do and then

4649.25 --> 4654.53
presenting their studies Oh as if we

4652.01 --> 4656.96
addressed that we talked about that and

4654.53 --> 4660.5599999999995
he did agree that yeah

4656.96 --> 4661.94
there is circumstances involved there

4660.56 --> 4663.740000000001
are limitations I mean obviously if you

4661.94 --> 4665.99
if you have an endless supply of money

4663.74 --> 4667.46
there really is nothing to stop you from

4665.99 --> 4670.61
doing whatever the hell you want though

4667.46 --> 4673.15
what people publish that's restricted no

4670.61 --> 4676.07
matter how much money you have ideally

4673.15 --> 4677.719999999999
so you know it depends what you want to

4676.07 --> 4679.07
do with the experiments nobody's going

4677.72 --> 4681.41
to stop you from going out and buying

4679.07 --> 4683.15
your own material unless it's you know

4681.41 --> 4684.95
but some sort of super dangerous you

4683.15 --> 4686.57
know if you're buying mass amounts of

4684.95 --> 4688.5199999999995
uranium okay maybe somebody will stop

4686.57 --> 4690.41
you but you know if you're just buying a

4688.52 --> 4693.110000000001
set of electric plates or something to

4690.41 --> 4694.37
to use to illustrate something nobody's

4693.11 --> 4696.5
going to stop you from doing that the

4694.37 --> 4698.33
only time people would stop you is well

4696.5 --> 4700.1
when you're trying to publish it

4698.33 --> 4701.66
publish it because if you're if you're

4700.1 --> 4703.610000000001
doing something that's considered too

4701.66 --> 4705.11
basic to publish you know there's no

4703.61 --> 4706.28
point reinventing the wheel that's not

4705.11 --> 4711.5
going to get people attracted to the

4706.28 --> 4713.509999999999
journal people will stop you but by may

4711.5 --> 4715.22
as shout out for a moment to Colin

4713.51 --> 4719.02
Turner thank you for the five-part super

4715.22 --> 4721.64
chat donation much appreciated thank you

4719.02 --> 4725.27
hey Colin Turner hey be throwing that

4721.64 --> 4728.240000000001
money out there yeah man 5 you must be

4725.27 --> 4729.77
making a lot no good for you I'm a

4728.24 --> 4732.05
student I I'm stingy

4729.77 --> 4733.910000000001
I'm very stingy I take advantage of the

4732.05 --> 4737.150000000001
free sausage roll I get it Gregg's how

4733.91 --> 4738.38
about you know sandwiches oh I don't

4737.15 --> 4740.57
know if you guys have Gregg's it's a

4738.38 --> 4741.95
little M as it's a lovely little place

4740.57 --> 4744.849999999999
it's like it's like the McDonald's of

4741.95 --> 4747.83
Scotland it's just there everywhere oh

4744.85 --> 4750.83
I'm one of those crazy Americans so

4747.83 --> 4754.63
right there no world thinks for stupid

4750.83 --> 4758.66
yeah not all of you

4754.63 --> 4761.469
just truck now I'm joking - nah he's not

4758.66 --> 4761.469
that stupid

4762.55 --> 4770.150000000001
so how are you uh kept bringing up

4766.46 --> 4772.88
Einstein and I'm just curious do what

4770.15 --> 4774.53
experiments did one side do did is there

4772.88 --> 4777.59
anyone any experiment that you know uh

4774.53 --> 4780.08
I've honestly I've not really read up in

4777.59 --> 4781.64
any of Einstein's experiments I I didn't

4780.08 --> 4783.5
really particularly want to discuss it

4781.64 --> 4785.660000000001
to be honest I don't know enough about I

4783.5 --> 4788.81
perhaps just to reiterate I am an

4785.66 --> 4791.78
undergraduate student I my knowledge is

4788.81 --> 4794.18
limited I'm not a PhD professor or

4791.78 --> 4795.23
anything I'm just some guy who happens

4794.18 --> 4797.18
to be studying and I thought you'd come

4795.23 --> 4800.83
on the show so I don't know much of

4797.18 --> 4802.88
anything about Einsteins experiments

4800.83 --> 4808.969
well if you find one

4802.88 --> 4811.4890000000005
please let somebody know sure and I mean

4808.969 --> 4814.16
because it seems like all right paper

4811.489 --> 4817.25
sorry you're not able to I'm sure they

4814.16 --> 4819.53
worked more so you know four years ago

4817.25 --> 4821.36
you know I I would have I would have

4819.53 --> 4825.469
accepted everything he said on the show

4821.36 --> 4828.259999999999
right and until I had it drilled in my

4825.469 --> 4833.42
head over and over how the scientific

4828.26 --> 4836.360000000001
method works and when I finally could

4833.42 --> 4839.06
copper in that then I understood that if

4836.36 --> 4841.13
it doesn't fall within that scientific

4839.06 --> 4845.0
method then it's wrong it's

4841.13 --> 4847.400000000001
pseudoscience and it took me a while to

4845.0 --> 4852.65
understand there but now I do in in

4847.4 --> 4855.98
order to prove a call in effect you have

4852.65 --> 4861.339999999999
to be able to vary your independent

4855.98 --> 4866.349999999999
variable and when you can't do that then

4861.34 --> 4870.2300000000005
you gotta throw it out as a school sense

4866.35 --> 4872.27
here's my problem I see when you say oh

4870.23 --> 4873.889999999999
it out we what do you mean

4872.27 --> 4875.330000000001
so see the end the equation that was

4873.89 --> 4876.92
referring to that gets the force on a

4875.33 --> 4880.13
mass and a gravitational field would you

4876.92 --> 4882.29
throw that out would you throw F equals

4880.13 --> 4885.41
mg out because you're considering it

4882.29 --> 4887.67
pseudoscience yeah yeah then if you did

4885.41 --> 4889.29
that you don't understand

4887.67 --> 4892.08
much of a problem that we cause we would

4889.29 --> 4893.64
be very very limited because we wouldn't

4892.08 --> 4896.429
have been able to determine the charge

4893.64 --> 4899.55
in an electron and by extension its mass

4896.429 --> 4902.28
because of it well I'm sure there is a

4899.55 --> 4904.679
way to bypass that I'm absolutely

4902.28 --> 4907.62
certain because you have to realize that

4904.679 --> 4909.63
is being constructed on the foundation

4907.62 --> 4912.449
of gravity being a thing

4909.63 --> 4918.06
well if you can leave it out or replace

4912.449 --> 4921.57
it it can be done okay you don't need to

4918.06 --> 4924.75
resort to pseudoscience in order for

4921.57 --> 4929.009999999999
everything to work if it works it works

4924.75 --> 4931.44
but yeah doesn't mean that every part of

4929.01 --> 4934.2300000000005
it necessarily is a real thing because

4931.44 --> 4936.419999999999
in order to do that in order to make it

4934.23 --> 4940.049999999999
scientific you have to prove every

4936.42 --> 4943.59
element part of your complex hypothesis

4940.05 --> 4945.78
or whatever it's going to be so you know

4943.59 --> 4948.42
the proving every element it seems to me

4945.78 --> 4950.13
that this this addition or REM addition

4948.42 --> 4951.719
of the scientific method has been

4950.13 --> 4953.82
isolated to your group and I don't I

4951.719 --> 4956.16
don't get it we seem to make exemptions

4953.82 --> 4958.5
occasionally where it seems rational but

4956.16 --> 4961.0199999999995
those rational exemptions are for good

4958.5 --> 4963.5
reason if you want to think about it

4961.02 --> 4966.63
like this instead of considering gravity

4963.5 --> 4967.64
something that has to be preserved much

4966.63 --> 4970.05
like electricity

4967.64 --> 4972.51
imagine me instead of saying gravity

4970.05 --> 4974.76
just saying what you've already said is

4972.51 --> 4976.56
accepted F equals mg because that is in

4974.76 --> 4977.91
essence all I am saying that's all that

4976.56 --> 4980.429
anybody has ever really been saying in

4977.91 --> 4983.21
science right around the subject in the

4980.429 --> 4985.2300000000005
1970s if we didn't have our

4983.21 --> 4987.179
understanding of gravitational theory

4985.23 --> 4988.32
which you call pseudoscience we would

4987.179 --> 4990.12
not have been able to determine the

4988.32 --> 4991.11
charge of the electron at that time now

4990.12 --> 4992.969
I'm not saying that we wouldn't have

4991.11 --> 4995.339999999999
came up with another method at some

4992.969 --> 4997.17
point but I certainly don't don't think

4995.34 --> 5000.38
it would be I think it's the other way

4997.17 --> 5003.71
around or maybe not I'm not too sure but

5000.38 --> 5006.17
look the relative density Theory can

5003.71 --> 5010.04
very much be used and pretty certain it

5006.17 --> 5013.88
can be used it would be the same system

5010.04 --> 5016.5199999999995
yeah it would and that maybe a little

5013.88 --> 5018.89
bit more complex but not too much really

5016.52 --> 5021.080000000001
I'm not totally certain on what this

5018.89 --> 5021.5
relative density theory as I don't know

5021.08 --> 5025.43
much

5021.5 --> 5030.08
- but um could you ask Nate I asked a

5025.43 --> 5031.610000000001
thriving warrior ask him Oh sorted and

5030.08 --> 5034.7
how we're explaining it to you

5031.61 --> 5038.179999999999
well that's nice but all I really need

5034.7 --> 5040.3099999999995
is an equation oh we got rollin and I

5038.18 --> 5041.72
was actually that is Irie Nathan must be

5040.31 --> 5043.160000000001
a mind reader I was just about to ask

5041.72 --> 5046.76
well why don't we ask Nathan to come on

5043.16 --> 5048.47
that is eerie maybe Nathan in charge of

5046.76 --> 5054.89
it all maybe he's hey Nathan was going

5048.47 --> 5058.04
home every years oh thanks to meet you

5054.89 --> 5062.93
Nathan hello what's your name Kyle

5058.04 --> 5064.04
nice to meet you pal likewise so yeah do

5062.93 --> 5069.62
you know a lot about this relative

5064.04 --> 5071.66
density theory thing the intensity

5069.62 --> 5073.19
theory what you mean oh that was what

5071.66 --> 5075.41
Hagen you talk like that I I don't know

5073.19 --> 5077.599999999999
a whole lot about it yeah the

5075.41 --> 5081.3099999999995
scientifically proven theory of relative

5077.6 --> 5085.7300000000005
density actually scientifically proven

5081.31 --> 5087.79
so there's there a paper somewhere or

5085.73 --> 5090.32
[Music]

5087.79 --> 5092.12
I'm coming into this conversation with

5090.32 --> 5095.36
you so I don't know oh sorry

5092.12 --> 5097.34
um okay well how about I just explain a

5095.36 --> 5099.5
little bit I was given the example of

5097.34 --> 5102.17
there was an experiment done in the

5099.5 --> 5104.9
1970s called Robert Milliken's oil-drop

5102.17 --> 5107.78
experiment it it's a bit complicated to

5104.9 --> 5110.12
explain but very simply a mass with a

5107.78 --> 5113.45
charge was suspended in an electrical

5110.12 --> 5115.19
field now this electrical field if we

5113.45 --> 5117.41
were to redo this experiment slightly

5115.19 --> 5120.23
differently could be manipulated such

5117.41 --> 5123.11
that we can use gravitational theory and

5120.23 --> 5124.849999999999
equations to calibrate the electric

5123.11 --> 5127.21
field such that the particle remains

5124.85 --> 5129.29
still then my argument is that if

5127.21 --> 5132.2
gravitational theory is Buncombe and

5129.29 --> 5133.94
nonsense we shouldn't be able to do that

5132.2 --> 5134.63
because that would be sort of

5133.94 --> 5138.7699999999995
contradictory

5134.63 --> 5142.22
this equation F equals mg the sort of

5138.77 --> 5145.370000000001
founding principle of gravity it works

5142.22 --> 5147.29
it works really really well and without

5145.37 --> 5149.0
it we can't do things like calculating

5147.29 --> 5151.04
the charge of an electron at least we

5149.0 --> 5153.92
couldn't in the 1970s I'm sure there's a

5151.04 --> 5154.969
way now to do it that that doesn't you

5153.92 --> 5157.58
know involve grab

5154.969 --> 5159.26
- but oh well you know that it wouldn't

5157.58 --> 5161.0
have been as easy as it was then

5159.26 --> 5164.06
I'm sure that that other method is

5161.0 --> 5166.85
probably not as easy as this one so that

5164.06 --> 5170.030000000001
was the point we were saying with our F

5166.85 --> 5171.26
equals mg we would be a bit screwed or

5170.03 --> 5173.03
at least that's what I was saying sorry

5171.26 --> 5174.59
and an Armin time Tina said well we

5173.03 --> 5176.15
could use relative density theory and I

5174.59 --> 5180.469
said what do you mean by that what is

5176.15 --> 5182.21
that so that's where we are now I've

5180.469 --> 5183.56
never heard of that the phrase before I

5182.21 --> 5185.449
might know what it is but I'm just not

5183.56 --> 5198.610000000001
familiar with the name I'm probably

5185.449 --> 5198.61
gonna google it now oh okay oh hello

5201.79 --> 5206.719
hopefully anything could come back oh

5204.07 --> 5208.61
okay I've just looked at what Israel no

5206.719 --> 5210.44
I dunno what this says sorry I just

5208.61 --> 5213.11
didn't know it by that name

5210.44 --> 5214.849999999999
sorry that that's happened a lot that

5213.11 --> 5216.65
would you know somebody says something

5214.85 --> 5219.88
like the hell is that and I think oh oh

5216.65 --> 5223.37
that's what it is right okay

5219.88 --> 5226.76
when did Nathan go I think he - I'm

5223.37 --> 5230.33
afraid right sorry just to reiterate I

5226.76 --> 5230.84
do understand about the density I see

5230.33 --> 5233.63
what you mean

5230.84 --> 5234.860000000001
I didn't realize that you know I didn't

5233.63 --> 5237.68
realize that's what you were Franco's

5234.86 --> 5241.099999999999
and he's back he's back he might just be

5237.68 --> 5242.900000000001
me again let us happy good in action

5241.1 --> 5244.820000000001
sound like I'll tell you what the

5242.9 --> 5246.349999999999
problem is just keeps kicking me out so

5244.82 --> 5248.449
if he does say again I won't try and

5246.35 --> 5250.58
rejoin but just let me stay in there

5248.449 --> 5252.53
great okay well we sort of solved the

5250.58 --> 5255.0199999999995
problem anyway I just wasn't sure what

5252.53 --> 5257.139999999999
Arwen was was referring to but I I

5255.02 --> 5260.900000000001
understand though the relative density

5257.14 --> 5262.85
you know I understand what you mean by

5260.9 --> 5265.46
saying like the relative density say if

5262.85 --> 5269.360000000001
we have to if we have two objects and

5265.46 --> 5270.59
say if we have a water of a certain

5269.36 --> 5273.589999999999
density that's greater than its

5270.59 --> 5276.02
surroundings say two air then the watch

5273.59 --> 5277.9400000000005
is going to fall down that's the prime

5276.02 --> 5280.85
example really because this happens

5277.94 --> 5282.679999999999
quite a lot would rain water heats up

5280.85 --> 5284.860000000001
and becomes last dance and then flies up

5282.68 --> 5286.820000000001
obviously through the air and it

5284.86 --> 5288.23
condenses again and then falls back down

5286.82 --> 5290.63
that's a

5288.23 --> 5292.37
example of no density theory so ya know

5290.63 --> 5295.97
I knew you meant sorry I just wasn't

5292.37 --> 5298.849999999999
familiar with the name right the

5295.97 --> 5301.43
relative densities of each or the

5298.85 --> 5307.4890000000005
density of every material will naturally

5301.43 --> 5310.37
seek the position where it is at its

5307.489 --> 5314.5
level at its typical level in relation

5310.37 --> 5317.0599999999995
to everybody yeah hmm yeah pretty much

5314.5 --> 5318.53
yeah but the thing is that's actually a

5317.06 --> 5320.27
component of gravity funnily enough

5318.53 --> 5321.65
that's caused by gravity hmm

5320.27 --> 5324.080000000001
well you can assume that that's the

5321.65 --> 5325.73
funny thing yeah but that's that's

5324.08 --> 5327.73
always the same thing isn't it you can

5325.73 --> 5331.9
always stick gravity on everything

5327.73 --> 5334.19
really yeah but you don't need to though

5331.9 --> 5335.719999999999
the way we do need to to explain

5334.19 --> 5336.98
relative density theory that's the

5335.72 --> 5339.530000000001
accepted definition requires

5336.98 --> 5342.739
gravitational theory to explain it not

5339.53 --> 5346.19
really no absolutely a mass is a product

5342.739 --> 5348.65
of density and and volume it's that's

5346.19 --> 5351.259999999999
why that happens that's right because

5348.65 --> 5356.15
it's caused by a natural displacement of

5351.26 --> 5361.16
the mass seeking its level it's no

5356.15 --> 5363.41
gravity the force that's causing that to

5361.16 --> 5366.11
happen is gravity that's what we call

5363.41 --> 5369.08
gravity know that's what you assume it's

5366.11 --> 5370.73
not that's what the experiments prove no

5369.08 --> 5372.5
I just found that your your agreement on

5370.73 --> 5375.91
one the word prove is is very different

5372.5 --> 5378.61
from mine mine is perhaps a bit more

5375.91 --> 5380.96
pseudoscience yes that's correct

5378.61 --> 5383.0
gravity as a cause without actually

5380.96 --> 5385.55
proving it scientifically than your that

5383.0 --> 5388.25
pseudoscience yes but it is no doesn't

5385.55 --> 5391.820000000001
need to know the density doesn't need

5388.25 --> 5394.85
gravity as a concept to exist in order

5391.82 --> 5399.29
for it to work okay then explain why it

5394.85 --> 5404.14
happens without gravity well it's an

5399.29 --> 5409.19
effect inherent to mass itself it

5404.14 --> 5410.93
displaces naturally if it's not at its

5409.19 --> 5415.009999999999
level in relation to everything else

5410.93 --> 5416.96
around it displacement is caused by the

5415.01 --> 5419.55
mass itself

5416.96 --> 5421.83
could I not say everything you just sent

5419.55 --> 5424.83
there about gravity and then you would

5421.83 --> 5426.2699999999995
say oh but you haven't proven it so what

5424.83 --> 5428.42
I'm gonna say here is because you're

5426.27 --> 5431.790000000001
claiming an external force

5428.42 --> 5433.5
it's what external it's yeah it's

5431.79 --> 5435.9
something that you can't measure that is

5433.5 --> 5437.85
supposedly there well with relative

5435.9 --> 5441.719999999999
density you have don't have to do that

5437.85 --> 5446.820000000001
you can directly attain it to mass which

5441.72 --> 5449.97
you can vary we can measure it it's just

5446.82 --> 5451.799999999999
we can't you can't manipulate it you can

5449.97 --> 5454.29
only assume it's there please don't

5451.8 --> 5456.66
don't start repeating yourself now come

5454.29 --> 5457.11
on well no because we I'm not repeating

5456.66 --> 5459.15
myself

5457.11 --> 5460.32
it's your statements are contradictory

5459.15 --> 5462.24
to what you've stated already you think

5460.32 --> 5464.25
you can't measure it we can measure it

5462.24 --> 5465.599999999999
we just can't manipulate it and edit it

5464.25 --> 5467.13
the same way we can with an electric

5465.6 --> 5468.900000000001
field with an electric field we can

5467.13 --> 5470.97
change the voltage between them but we

5468.9 --> 5474.799999999999
can't do that with masses but you can't

5470.97 --> 5477.030000000001
measure it you can only deduce it if

5474.8 --> 5480.42
it's not measuring there's nothing to

5477.03 --> 5484.74
measure the only thing you can measure

5480.42 --> 5486.63
is how matter babes cuz concerning the

5484.74 --> 5489.33
assumed gravity what it's supposed to be

5486.63 --> 5492.12
itself you can't measure anything about

5489.33 --> 5495.8099999999995
it you can only deduce it from how

5492.12 --> 5500.37
matter responds in the world you deduce

5495.81 --> 5503.04
it other things not it and with relative

5500.37 --> 5507.39
density that problems not there how do

5503.04 --> 5509.1
you measure it huh oh I was afraid to

5507.39 --> 5511.200000000001
gravitational fields when I said measure

5509.1 --> 5513.84
it you can measure out there's no field

5511.2 --> 5516.9
okay see if we take a parallel set of

5513.84 --> 5518.7300000000005
electric plates what we can do is we can

5516.9 --> 5520.11
induce a voltage between them and what

5518.73 --> 5522.33
that causes is an electric field to

5520.11 --> 5525.87
occur constant electric field across the

5522.33 --> 5527.61
plates okay you with me so far that's

5525.87 --> 5528.87
that's okay right nobody's got any

5527.61 --> 5530.4
disagreements with what I'm saying so

5528.87 --> 5533.16
far because I've said this a few times

5530.4 --> 5535.29
now so okay okay say it again maybe a

5533.16 --> 5537.18
little slow yeah oh sorry

5535.29 --> 5541.38
when I'm nervous I say things quickly

5537.18 --> 5542.9400000000005
understand is something really new say a

5541.38 --> 5545.97
little bit little slower so we can

5542.94 --> 5548.16
really sure get it clear what you exist

5545.97 --> 5549.439
I'm not very good at public speaking I'm

5548.16 --> 5551.059
sorry

5549.439 --> 5554.059
fine you didn't you're doing great

5551.059 --> 5558.169
everybody all right well if we have two

5554.059 --> 5562.55
plates just metal plates and we induce a

5558.169 --> 5564.469
voltage across them well what happens is

5562.55 --> 5567.409000000001
there's an electric field between the

5564.469 --> 5568.729
plates okay does anybody have any

5567.409 --> 5572.209
disagreements with that so far

5568.729 --> 5574.6990000000005
well yeah where do we see this gravity

5572.209 --> 5575.9
in nature so rather than telling me what

5574.699 --> 5577.848999999999
you're going to induce in a man-made

5575.9 --> 5580.489
device where do we observe it naturally

5577.849 --> 5582.53
happening well this is actually an

5580.489 --> 5583.928999999999
example of it naturally happening sorry

5582.53 --> 5586.34
take me to your naturally-occurring

5583.929 --> 5589.039
magnetized plates please where does that

5586.34 --> 5590.57
happen in nature I'm not saying that

5589.039 --> 5591.53
we're not talking about electric plates

5590.57 --> 5593.688999999999
no I'll ask again

5591.53 --> 5598.219
we're in nature does this happen we're

5593.689 --> 5602.179
in nature is another this is another

5598.219 --> 5603.829
level that I don't fully ascribe to but

5602.179 --> 5605.059
I do reckon it seems to be right now

5603.829 --> 5606.978999999999
it's like saying how do you measure

5605.059 --> 5608.570000000001
distance in nature anything but we take

5606.979 --> 5610.280000000001
a ruler all the words is a ruler occur

5608.57 --> 5611.539
in nature that's that's akin to what

5610.28 --> 5614.389
you're saying right now we're using the

5611.539 --> 5619.28
electric plates a concept thank you what

5614.389 --> 5621.59
we're saying sorry I'm saying where do

5619.28 --> 5624.38
we experience I'm aware now all right

5621.59 --> 5625.969
I'm nearly there so where do we

5624.38 --> 5628.099
experience the thing that you are going

5625.969 --> 5629.479
about to measure so you're saying the

5628.099 --> 5631.55
thing you're going to measure is gravity

5629.479 --> 5635.809
and I'm asking where do we observe that

5631.55 --> 5638.900000000001
in nature so just on day to day life

5635.809 --> 5640.669
just independent that okay well gravity

5638.9 --> 5643.579
is the idea that there's a force applied

5640.669 --> 5644.84
per mass in a gravitational field now

5643.579 --> 5647.449
I'm saying that there's a gravitational

5644.84 --> 5651.26
field on earth ergo every mass no no

5647.449 --> 5653.449
sorry sorry about what earth does but

5651.26 --> 5657.289000000001
where do I observe in nature anything

5653.449 --> 5658.728999999999
that not not your foot anything oh well

5657.289 --> 5659.869
not theirs not that simple but if you

5658.729 --> 5661.400000000001
want a really really straight forward

5659.869 --> 5662.9
without having me explain it then yeah

5661.4 --> 5665.119
anything that has a force applied

5662.9 --> 5667.249
downwards towards the towards the center

5665.119 --> 5668.57
of Earth is chances are due to gravity

5667.249 --> 5670.55
that's not saying that every force is

5668.57 --> 5673.009999999999
you could induce an electric force but

5670.55 --> 5674.869000000001
my point is on a day to day life if you

5673.01 --> 5676.909000000001
were to say drop your keys that's an

5674.869 --> 5679.699
example of gravity but I'm assuming no

5676.909 --> 5681.199
no no no the keys are more dense than

5679.699 --> 5682.159
the air they're passing but the only

5681.199 --> 5682.909
reason that that's happening is because

5682.159 --> 5685.429
of gravity

5682.909 --> 5687.17
if I drop my I drop my helium balloon

5685.429 --> 5689.03
will that do the same thing no because

5687.17 --> 5690.9490000000005
helium is different from the air around

5689.03 --> 5694.19
it that that's also a component I'm

5690.949 --> 5696.5599999999995
sorry to be saying an expression that

5694.19 --> 5698.33
relates it to the air around it wouldn't

5696.56 --> 5701.030000000001
that be relative density that you're

5698.33 --> 5702.62
explaining balloon going up so the air

5701.03 --> 5704.15
is more dense with reasons yeah that's

5702.62 --> 5709.94
relative density that's what I just said

5704.15 --> 5711.138999999999
so you know sorry we're off on a track I

5709.94 --> 5712.969
just want to know where you observe

5711.139 --> 5714.469
gravity in nature just tell me that I

5712.969 --> 5716.06
don't like Donna described relative

5714.469 --> 5718.01
density and what happens in relative

5716.06 --> 5719.9890000000005
density just tell me where we observe

5718.01 --> 5722.780000000001
gravity make sure the flopping Keys is

5719.989 --> 5724.638999999999
its relative density versus the air so

5722.78 --> 5726.349999999999
if I drop helium it goes up so that's

5724.639 --> 5728.09
not an example that I can take as an

5726.35 --> 5729.860000000001
example of gravity so where do I

5728.09 --> 5732.02
preserve gravity in a if you want an

5729.86 --> 5735.469
example that has absolutely nothing to

5732.02 --> 5737.389
do with anything around the OP the

5735.469 --> 5739.19
object I can give you that but let me go

5737.389 --> 5743.75
through the electric plates just I need

5739.19 --> 5745.25
to set on about some experiment you're

5743.75 --> 5750.08
going to do apparently well I don't want

5745.25 --> 5752.9
to know where I observe the example to

5750.08 --> 5755.21
your example of density the

5752.9 --> 5757.969
gravitational theory is in accepted

5755.21 --> 5759.65
science the cause of that that is where

5757.969 --> 5766.34
you would observe gravity in nature now

5759.65 --> 5768.049999999999
obviously you I see excellent the

5766.34 --> 5770.360000000001
scientific method would be the thing

5768.05 --> 5771.7390000000005
that elucidated it as the cause so

5770.36 --> 5773.54
you're saying the natural phenomena is

5771.739 --> 5774.83
actually relative density that's the

5773.54 --> 5777.17
phenomenon we were observing is that

5774.83 --> 5781.37
what you say so dropping the keys it's

5777.17 --> 5782.929
just a forced phenomenon of relative

5781.37 --> 5784.88
density and you're going to establish

5782.929 --> 5786.469
the cause which would be using the

5784.88 --> 5789.56
scientific effort correct

5786.469 --> 5791.06
I'm sure yeah okay okay so what's the

5789.56 --> 5793.159000000001
experiment that's been done to establish

5791.06 --> 5796.25
the cause of relative density and how

5793.159 --> 5798.71
did you bury gravity well if you want

5796.25 --> 5800.15
the the cause of relative density what

5798.71 --> 5801.469
you've just told me it's gravity you

5800.15 --> 5803.48
just told me this you've said the cause

5801.469 --> 5804.949
described I know there I'm trying to use

5803.48 --> 5807.049999999999
oh now I want to know if that's your

5804.949 --> 5809.12
cause it's your independent variable in

5807.05 --> 5811.969
your hypothesis how are you gonna bury

5809.12 --> 5815.659
gravity hold on a second we don't need

5811.969 --> 5816.21
to vary gravity - you do yes and I've

5815.659 --> 5818.339999999999
got it

5816.21 --> 5822.77
okay it's an independent variable from

5818.34 --> 5825.54
your berry yes you are incorrect

5822.77 --> 5828.540000000001
undergraduate your independent variable

5825.54 --> 5830.43
absolutely requires varying so I want to

5828.54 --> 5832.05
know for the third time how you're gonna

5830.43 --> 5833.4890000000005
bury this thing called rabbit and I

5832.05 --> 5834.9890000000005
would be more than happy to elaborate

5833.489 --> 5841.5599999999995
and tell you if you would shut the [ __ ]

5834.989 --> 5843.239
up for ten friend you're flattered

5841.56 --> 5845.31
friend on the one hand it was to me is

5843.239 --> 5846.959999999999
handing you your ass by asking you how

5845.31 --> 5850.530000000001
you will bear it innate that you haven't

5846.96 --> 5852.39
shown us is it or is it the effect you

5850.53 --> 5853.98
don't I wouldn't rather swear at me

5852.39 --> 5856.02
because you're very triggered cuz I'm

5853.98 --> 5859.95
holding your toast to the fire now tell

5856.02 --> 5862.290000000001
me how you very and manipulate your

5859.95 --> 5864.63
independent variable of gravity yeah I

5862.29 --> 5867.2699999999995
did ask you this before to Kyle are you

5864.63 --> 5869.82
never really I'm gonna me responded to

5867.27 --> 5872.13
that so he does have a point

5869.82 --> 5874.53
I know Nathan's being a bit harsh here

5872.13 --> 5876.42
that's harsh I'm not allowed to talk

5874.53 --> 5878.3099999999995
right let me give my example of electric

5876.42 --> 5880.17
plates yeah but that's not an answer to

5878.31 --> 5882.120000000001
the question that you've told us that

5880.17 --> 5884.13
what the phenomena is that we establish

5882.12 --> 5886.5
in the cause of is relative density

5884.13 --> 5888.09
you've said the causes gravity now show

5886.5 --> 5890.07
me how you can vary and manipulate that

5888.09 --> 5894.150000000001
that you presume is the cause this is

5890.07 --> 5896.37
science why are you just lying about

5894.15 --> 5898.469
what you're doing this as a education

5896.37 --> 5900.78
process because it seems that I would

5898.469 --> 5902.64
understand that you very and manipulate

5900.78 --> 5904.29
an independent variable to prove the

5902.64 --> 5906.63
cause of an effect do you not know that

5904.29 --> 5908.25
I do know that right so tell me how

5906.63 --> 5914.61
you're buried what you have told me on

5908.25 --> 5917.07
improv this effect talking and tell me

5914.61 --> 5923.04
how you bury gravity you've not shown us

5917.07 --> 5925.049999999999
stop talking and tell me something I'm

5923.04 --> 5927.93
courting you talking and tell me

5925.05 --> 5929.969
something I would love to see the

5927.93 --> 5931.17
example you gave a relative density the

5929.969 --> 5932.58
reason that we can attribute that to

5931.17 --> 5934.35
gravity is because when we surround

5932.58 --> 5936.33
those keys in a vacuum they still go

5934.35 --> 5938.55
down and they go down with the fourth

5936.33 --> 5941.04
proportionate to the to the M equations

5938.55 --> 5942.96
in the theory well you're removing that

5941.04 --> 5945.75
let me all removing and please Siddhant

5942.96 --> 5948.3
you're removing the aspect of relative

5945.75 --> 5949.8
density when you remove the air right

5948.3 --> 5951.4800000000005
well yeah the air

5949.8 --> 5954.599
even though it's gonna be supposedly a

5951.48 --> 5958.739
vacuum it's this relative density rule

5954.599 --> 5961.1990000000005
still function as they are so a vacuum

5958.739 --> 5964.619
is not gonna take away the displacement

5961.199 --> 5966.629999999999
effect caused by relative density see

5964.619 --> 5969.089999999999
the point that I'm making is that the

5966.63 --> 5972.599
relative density is only a thing because

5969.09 --> 5975.659000000001
of gravity cause us because you assumed

5972.599 --> 5977.52
that case no it's only an expense it's

5975.659 --> 5979.7699999999995
only aspect when you remove the very

5977.52 --> 5982.619000000001
thing that causes it which is relative

5979.77 --> 5984.63
density you're saying if I remove the

5982.619 --> 5986.04
aspect of the density of the medium it's

5984.63 --> 5988.77
traveling through then everything

5986.04 --> 5992.309
travels at the same rate well where do

5988.77 --> 5994.26
we observe that in nature what sorry

5992.309 --> 5998.04
give me that again where do we observe

5994.26 --> 6000.320000000001
that which you say 9.8 meters per second

5998.04 --> 6002.449
per second in a vacuum where do we

6000.32 --> 6004.429
observe that happening in nature because

6002.449 --> 6008.03
you're just removing the very aspect of

6004.429 --> 6010.82
relative density by removing the air so

6008.03 --> 6012.259999999999
this only occurs in your example the

6010.82 --> 6014.48
experiment in this if you're going to

6012.26 --> 6017.4490000000005
call it this vacuum chamber or your

6014.48 --> 6019.79
mates or and finished sorry or in your

6017.449 --> 6020.989
plates that you'd go on about I simply

6019.79 --> 6022.639
want to know what we observe in nature

6020.989 --> 6024.65
and what you tell me is we observe

6022.639 --> 6026.2390000000005
relative density where does gravity come

6024.65 --> 6029.659
in well when I remove the relative

6026.239 --> 6032.9
aspect of it well this is nonsense total

6029.659 --> 6035.239
nonsense if you claim that gravity is

6032.9 --> 6037.67
the cause of the effect of relative

6035.239 --> 6039.799999999999
density then you show me the experiment

6037.67 --> 6041.869
where you varied that which you presume

6039.8 --> 6046.400000000001
to the cause in this case gravity

6041.869 --> 6049.25
show me that I did ask you only but you

6046.4 --> 6051.049999999999
bring up the plates sorry right okay

6049.25 --> 6051.469
well allow me to answer it then as best

6051.05 --> 6053.54
I can

6051.469 --> 6055.849
the issue is the only example that we

6053.54 --> 6058.369
can give where 9.8 meters per second per

6055.849 --> 6060.1990000000005
second is observed unhindered is an

6058.369 --> 6062.719
example at which does not conform to

6060.199 --> 6066.5199999999995
your your standards you want stuff to be

6062.719 --> 6066.52
in essence in the way of the density

6066.73 --> 6075.638999999999
that's not right the first acceleration

6071.03 --> 6079.969
rate of which G is derived it is a thing

6075.639 --> 6083.2
but that doesn't make it a force it's a

6079.969 --> 6087.31
deducted element is a statistical effect

6083.2 --> 6091.51
side effect an anomaly a phenomena but

6087.31 --> 6095.14
that doesn't prove a force what the

6091.51 --> 6096.85
thing is how do I put this um the 9.8

6095.14 --> 6099.820000000001
meters per second per second is used to

6096.85 --> 6102.490000000001
sell rotational force because oh that's

6099.82 --> 6106.0199999999995
what you assume it's an acceleration

6102.49 --> 6109.8099999999995
rate reduce to be there that doesn't

6106.02 --> 6111.370000000001
necessarily imply naturally a force to

6109.81 --> 6115.63
be there that is where you jump the

6111.37 --> 6119.5
assumption the acceleration rate is

6115.63 --> 6121.51
caused by a force really yeah when you

6119.5 --> 6123.22
remove the air when you remove what you

6121.51 --> 6125.62
said was your phenomena you said it's

6123.22 --> 6128.2
relative density something we observe in

6125.62 --> 6130.2699999999995
nature not vacuums so then you remove

6128.2 --> 6132.16
the relative aspect of it and blame it

6130.27 --> 6134.38
on this thing called gravity so you're

6132.16 --> 6136.389999999999
removing the relative aspect by putting

6134.38 --> 6137.8
it in a vacuum so this is non remove

6136.39 --> 6139.570000000001
we're removing things that would

6137.8 --> 6142.24
otherwise hinder the edge from what

6139.57 --> 6144.969999999999
you're saying the phenomena is relative

6142.24 --> 6146.53
density when I said why are you talking

6144.97 --> 6148.54
I went on me I shut up while you talk

6146.53 --> 6150.61
all right listen to your nonsense what

6148.54 --> 6151.2699999999995
why is it why are you still talking now

6150.61 --> 6153.67
yeah

6151.27 --> 6155.59
put yourself on mute and shut up when

6153.67 --> 6157.4400000000005
you remove the very aspect of the

6155.59 --> 6160.72
phenomena you claimed you were observing

6157.44 --> 6162.46
relative density then you attribute a

6160.72 --> 6164.9800000000005
force to the very thing you've removed

6162.46 --> 6167.83
and you're left with something that's

6164.98 --> 6169.48
relative also direction so you've got a

6167.83 --> 6171.1
relative force for a relative direction

6169.48 --> 6173.41
in a very unnatural state that you've

6171.1 --> 6177.67
created this is total and utter nonsense

6173.41 --> 6180.58
if you claim gravity is the cause of

6177.67 --> 6182.83
relative density then show me it causing

6180.58 --> 6185.71
things to be dense in a relative state

6182.83 --> 6187.75
don't remove the density of the very

6185.71 --> 6189.19
nature of the medium it's in and then

6187.75 --> 6191.53
claim a force that you're trying to

6189.19 --> 6195.599999999999
prove in the first instance causes that

6191.53 --> 6198.25
relative density this is utter nonsense

6195.6 --> 6200.68
yeah I have to agree with that don't

6198.25 --> 6204.4
speak perfect right so just to

6200.68 --> 6205.27
illustrate well let's take I know what

6204.4 --> 6206.62
you guys don't want me to go through

6205.27 --> 6208.84
vacuums you want me to give an example

6206.62 --> 6211.36
in nature where we see gravitational

6208.84 --> 6212.9800000000005
theory at work independent from other

6211.36 --> 6214.99
things like red not where we see

6212.98 --> 6216.62
gravitational theory at work where we

6214.99 --> 6219.5
see this force

6216.62 --> 6221.15
you claim exists that is grab that's a

6219.5 --> 6222.8
proponent of gravitation of I can only

6221.15 --> 6224.57
give you gravitational theory so you can

6222.8 --> 6229.13
only give me the mathematics that's been

6224.57 --> 6231.349999999999
conjured by the metal line or mass just

6229.13 --> 6233.45
describes things it doesn't prove the

6231.35 --> 6235.58
cause of anything mass isn't proving

6233.45 --> 6237.679999999999
anything it's just a description of

6235.58 --> 6240.14
something so it doesn't give you a proof

6237.68 --> 6242.240000000001
of anything it's just a description

6240.14 --> 6243.8
it's a I thought you said you were on a

6242.24 --> 6244.4
scientific course why are you talking

6243.8 --> 6247.9400000000005
maths

6244.4 --> 6250.16
you're on a maths course then it's a

6247.94 --> 6251.629999999999
physics degree so you do understand

6250.16 --> 6253.099999999999
cause and effect relationships aren't

6251.63 --> 6255.89
caused by numbers and mathematics

6253.1 --> 6257.4800000000005
obviously I'm not right about your

6255.89 --> 6260.96
mathematical numbers when you attribute

6257.48 --> 6263.15
gravity your chosen course yelling at me

6260.96 --> 6264.86
about math aren't you the mathematical

6263.15 --> 6266.48
theory that you will apply to the

6264.86 --> 6268.4
nonsense that you do in a vacuum

6266.48 --> 6274.25
well that's maths the equations in

6268.4 --> 6275.87
mathematics Illinois things more we want

6274.25 --> 6278.9
to talk about the natural world not

6275.87 --> 6282.71
maths well we're trying to I think

6278.9 --> 6284.9
you've got a seed basically that yeah it

6282.71 --> 6287.21
all works out mathematically we talked

6284.9 --> 6289.849999999999
about this pretty calmly before it all

6287.21 --> 6292.61
works out mathematically but you can't

6289.85 --> 6295.58
really prove it and now we're trying to

6292.61 --> 6298.219999999999
basically force you to concede this fact

6295.58 --> 6302.3
but you keep on moving around or red

6298.22 --> 6304.01
herring to how the formulas work well we

6302.3 --> 6306.320000000001
know the formulas work but we're

6304.01 --> 6308.72
actually looking for the scientific

6306.32 --> 6311.87
evidence which requires a very specific

6308.72 --> 6313.79
method of approach okay then that that's

6311.87 --> 6315.44
that's fine then let's move totally away

6313.79 --> 6317.44
from the mass and totally away from all

6315.44 --> 6319.82
numbers I will not mention an equation

6317.44 --> 6321.5
to the best of my ability for the rest

6319.82 --> 6323.0599999999995
of this discussion I'm like excellent

6321.5 --> 6325.28
what's your scientific evidence of

6323.06 --> 6327.02
gravity how about instead of you asking

6325.28 --> 6328.759999999999
me questions for a second I get an

6327.02 --> 6330.860000000001
opportunity to give an example just for

6328.76 --> 6333.22
a few moments if you wouldn't mind just

6330.86 --> 6334.91
it's like you're a physicist

6333.22 --> 6336.5
undergraduate is it a scientific

6334.91 --> 6337.7
evidence so it will be scientific

6336.5 --> 6339.91
evidence then as that's what you're

6337.7 --> 6342.0199999999995
training for right this will guarantee

6339.91 --> 6344.9
excellent can you start by giving me the

6342.02 --> 6347.39
hypothesis Oh apes that will include the

6344.9 --> 6350.268999999999
phenomena and presume pause so go your

6347.39 --> 6351.9490000000005
inertia for gravity go

6350.269 --> 6353.719
you're asking me I wasn't gonna give a

6351.949 --> 6355.249
hypothesis for grammar that scientific

6353.719 --> 6356.4800000000005
evidence I just asked you if you were

6355.249 --> 6357.739
going to give a scientific evidence you

6356.48 --> 6359.48
replied in the affirmative

6357.739 --> 6361.07
now I damn well expect you to give me a

6359.48 --> 6363.379999999999
hypothesis that's what scientific

6361.07 --> 6365.9
evidence is do you really are you lying

6363.38 --> 6367.7300000000005
about your training in science because I

6365.9 --> 6369.499
make you to know that scientific

6367.73 --> 6371.089999999999
evidence come on hold on hold on right

6369.499 --> 6372.499
fine then if I'm lying then explain to

6371.09 --> 6375.139
me how I have this I'm gonna give you my

6372.499 --> 6377.84
lab reports okay okay I don't want lab

6375.139 --> 6380.3
reports I will do scientific evidence of

6377.84 --> 6382.4890000000005
gravity don't give me an appeal to your

6380.3 --> 6384.59
authorities and they have papers

6382.489 --> 6386.749
give me scientific evidence that would

6384.59 --> 6388.659000000001
be an observed phenomena a formulated

6386.749 --> 6391.01
hypothesis and systematic

6388.659 --> 6394.19
experimentation I would expect you to

6391.01 --> 6396.139
know this you don't seem to you you're

6394.19 --> 6398.388999999999
asking to do rocketed weeds to pay up

6396.139 --> 6400.67
concisely in the matter of minutes on a

6398.389 --> 6404.059
live stream no I just love your

6400.67 --> 6406.429
scientific this has been asserted by

6404.059 --> 6409.639
your superiors you should be able to

6406.429 --> 6411.889
acquire at a pinch some scientific

6409.639 --> 6414.1990000000005
validity for your Fundy belief in

6411.889 --> 6416.809
gravity so give it me scientific

6414.199 --> 6428.15
evidence of gravity I'm assuming you've

6416.809 --> 6429.469
no idea of a scientific method is to so

6428.15 --> 6430.999
if you understand what the scientific

6429.469 --> 6433.03
method is I understand what the

6430.999 --> 6436.789
scientific method is you give me

6433.03 --> 6440.119
scientific evidence for gravity go right

6436.789 --> 6445.039
okay please then please please do it and

6440.119 --> 6448.369
don't don't spin around let's not nathan

6445.039 --> 6451.61
is very direct very passionate and yeah

6448.369 --> 6454.848999999999
he's applying the typical Debates method

6451.61 --> 6456.98
I would like to come as a little bit

6454.849 --> 6459.9490000000005
down but yeah he does have a point and

6456.98 --> 6462.32
you keep on evading it I would like to

6459.949 --> 6465.049999999999
hear you explain your electrical plate

6462.32 --> 6468.23
experiment though or you call it an

6465.05 --> 6471.26
experiment but please don't assume

6468.23 --> 6473.48
therefore that that will actually be

6471.26 --> 6476.749
proof because yeah in order to have

6473.48 --> 6479.419999999999
scientific proof you will be required to

6476.749 --> 6482.449
manipulate the independent variable and

6479.42 --> 6483.63
not make a deduction based conclusion on

6482.449 --> 6487.5
some other of

6483.63 --> 6491.76
paratus just saying but please if Nathan

6487.5 --> 6495.75
would allow him to please explain the

6491.76 --> 6498.12
yeah the the experiment my problem Arwen

6495.75 --> 6499.98
is the fact that I saw your your early

6498.12 --> 6501.96
bird show and I thought here's a

6499.98 --> 6503.459999999999
completely normal irrational person he

6501.96 --> 6504.96
has his own beliefs in his own

6503.46 --> 6507.0
perspectives great well I come from a

6504.96 --> 6508.679
family that has a wide variety you know

6507.0 --> 6510.96
they're creationists and my family I'll

6508.679 --> 6512.52
bet I disagree with them the humanly but

6510.96 --> 6514.679
I'm good at talking with people like

6512.52 --> 6516.6
that because I show them respect I feel

6514.679 --> 6517.9490000000005
like I came on your show I so it was a

6516.6 --> 6520.05
very calm show you seem like a calm

6517.949 --> 6523.08
person I've came on and I've decided to

6520.05 --> 6524.7300000000005
partake in it and now we've ended up in

6523.08 --> 6527.159
a yelling contest with Nathan oh well

6524.73 --> 6530.3099999999995
let's stop it then and I'm asking Nathan

6527.159 --> 6534.17
to is a please just tone it down okay we

6530.31 --> 6537.06
got it I got a bit agitated as well yes

6534.17 --> 6543.2390000000005
agree right I apologize for swearing at

6537.06 --> 6546.389
you telling you to you know very sorry

6543.239 --> 6548.669999999999
I'll just be a little bit more calm in

6546.389 --> 6550.8
my approach and say pretty please with

6548.67 --> 6553.5
sugar on top please can you give us the

6550.8 --> 6555.51
observed phenomena and a hypothesis with

6553.5 --> 6557.57
systematic experimentation to back your

6555.51 --> 6564.780000000001
fundamentals believe in gravity please

6557.57 --> 6567.139
right right now okay and if we have how

6564.78 --> 6567.139
do I put this

6567.199 --> 6574.7699999999995
see let's I want to go through the logic

6569.88 --> 6576.96
please everybody go through the electric

6574.77 --> 6579.96
plates and Nathan please let him finish

6576.96 --> 6582.06
I did square off equations though which

6579.96 --> 6584.07
will be awfully difficult back and I can

6582.06 --> 6585.9890000000005
do it I can do it if I if I just don't

6584.07 --> 6587.4
because we use maths and physics to

6585.989 --> 6589.08
illustrate things that are awkward to

6587.4 --> 6591.089999999999
illustrate with words but there are

6589.08 --> 6594.33
they're gonna be looking as you explain

6591.09 --> 6596.55
it mostly at how you're actually

6594.33 --> 6598.739
manipulating the independent very what

6596.55 --> 6603.0
your approach is if the hierarchical

6598.739 --> 6605.5199999999995
structure of all the systems how that

6603.0 --> 6608.73
fits we don't really care about that

6605.52 --> 6610.38
okay that's okay in that I think I can

6608.73 --> 6615.0
give you an answer you'll appreciate all

6610.38 --> 6617.46
right Oh see if we with gravity unlike

6615.0 --> 6620.73
with things like electric fields we can

6617.46 --> 6622.77
change and alter the direct effect or

6620.73 --> 6624.299999999999
the the up so you see if we have an

6622.77 --> 6625.56
electric field there are two variables

6624.3 --> 6627.27
that we can alter we can alter the

6625.56 --> 6628.77
voltage and the distance between the

6627.27 --> 6630.900000000001
plates both of these things will change

6628.77 --> 6633.450000000001
the electric field we can only change

6630.9 --> 6635.16
basically one of these things in gravity

6633.45 --> 6637.08
other than the masses themselves if we

6635.16 --> 6638.61
keep those constant the only other thing

6637.08 --> 6642.0599999999995
we can change is the distance from the

6638.61 --> 6645.2699999999995
two the two sources that's it we can't

6642.06 --> 6649.71
change anything else if that's not good

6645.27 --> 6652.38
enough if that's not it that is it and

6649.71 --> 6653.85
you guys don't agree with that okay III

6652.38 --> 6657.66
can sort of see where you're coming from

6653.85 --> 6659.55
but that spread to any of the theory it

6657.66 --> 6661.2
just says that it's not to the same

6659.55 --> 6663.33
degree at which you would be happy with

6661.2 --> 6665.61
it's not in some scientific evidence

6663.33 --> 6667.62
basically it is scientific evidence

6665.61 --> 6669.299999999999
because all of it works it can is a

6667.62 --> 6672.24
theory is fostered by us and make it

6669.3 --> 6674.85
science you know works sorry sorry can I

6672.24 --> 6678.719999999999
interrupt finished the end to the end

6674.85 --> 6680.370000000001
coming up yep I mean so early you had

6678.72 --> 6682.14
our win on the colloquial use of the

6680.37 --> 6684.09
word theory so I'll ask you very

6682.14 --> 6686.25
directly was that a colloquial use of

6684.09 --> 6688.4400000000005
the word theory or such a scientific

6686.25 --> 6689.58
theory you were just mentioning when I

6688.44 --> 6691.11
said gravitational theory I was

6689.58 --> 6692.82
referring to two scientific theory Oh

6691.11 --> 6694.799999999999
scientific theories would be backed by

6692.82 --> 6696.75
systematic experimentation but by

6694.8 --> 6698.85
hypothesis after observing a phenomena

6696.75 --> 6701.07
and establishing causal effect in other

6698.85 --> 6702.72
words scientific theories are the result

6701.07 --> 6704.58
of an established cause-and-effect

6702.72 --> 6706.650000000001
relationship that is adhere to the

6704.58 --> 6708.93
scientific method all multiples are

6706.65 --> 6710.549999999999
there off so if it's a scientific theory

6708.93 --> 6712.38
it's based on scientific evidence

6710.55 --> 6715.71
precisely what I've been asking you for

6712.38 --> 6718.29
so give me the scientific evidence but

6715.71 --> 6720.03
back to theory of gravity starting with

6718.29 --> 6721.35
the observed phenomena followed by the

6720.03 --> 6722.82
hypothesis which would be the

6721.35 --> 6724.59
establishment of the independent and

6722.82 --> 6726.84
dependent variables otherwise known as

6724.59 --> 6729.78
observed phenomena and independent being

6726.84 --> 6732.63
your presumed cause in this case gravity

6729.78 --> 6734.13
so give me the scientific evidence is

6732.63 --> 6737.04
about the fifth time I've asked you a

6734.13 --> 6738.6
scientist for scientific evidence and

6737.04 --> 6740.1
you're saying well if I give you a load

6738.6 --> 6741.4800000000005
of maths that won't be satisfactory yeah

6740.1 --> 6742.68
I wanted it here it's the scientific

6741.48 --> 6745.049999999999
method that's what you're being trained

6742.68 --> 6746.58
in so you do understand that step one of

6745.05 --> 6748.29
the scientific method is to observe a

6746.58 --> 6750.15
phenomena something occurring in nature

6748.29 --> 6751.11
as it's a study of the physical and

6750.15 --> 6752.969999999999
natural world

6751.11 --> 6756.0599999999995
you do appreciate that set one of the

6752.97 --> 6759.59
method don't you of course so give me

6756.06 --> 6760.740000000001
step one what is your observed phenomena

6759.59 --> 6762.81
okay

6760.74 --> 6764.61
so just to go all the way back then to

6762.81 --> 6772.71
the start of the theory of gravity which

6764.61 --> 6774.03
is what your theories come last did you

6772.71 --> 6777.09
not understand what I just said

6774.03 --> 6779.58
theories are the result of an adherence

6777.09 --> 6781.860000000001
or multiple adherence --is to the

6779.58 --> 6784.11
scientific method don't go to the theory

6781.86 --> 6785.67
that's last are you done I thought you

6784.11 --> 6787.349999999999
were a man of science excuse me don't

6785.67 --> 6792.24
start with the theory

6787.35 --> 6796.02
step one observe a phenomena don't go to

6792.24 --> 6797.5199999999995
the end start at the beginning what kind

6796.02 --> 6798.84
of man of science doesn't start at the

6797.52 --> 6801.42
beginning and starts at the end I

6798.84 --> 6803.04
haven't finished I'm berating you for

6801.42 --> 6805.53
your idiocy I'm like why are you

6803.04 --> 6807.57
starting at the last step of theory when

6805.53 --> 6808.7699999999995
I ask you for your observe phenomena it

6807.57 --> 6810.9
is at the star of the theory what I

6808.77 --> 6819.150000000001
meant was the origination of the theory

6810.9 --> 6820.83
of gravity what let me ask him calmly

6819.15 --> 6825.2699999999995
and see if the actually responds in the

6820.83 --> 6828.12
affirmative step one in the scientific

6825.27 --> 6832.47
method in the pursuit of scientific

6828.12 --> 6838.13
evidence is to observe a natural

6832.47 --> 6838.13
phenomena now I want you to give me that

6839.21 --> 6846.68
or concede that you can please it's not

6842.91 --> 6851.01
that we can is that see the data do it

6846.68 --> 6852.96
the observed phenomena is impossible to

6851.01 --> 6856.74
observe unhindered in day-to-day life by

6852.96 --> 6858.18
then it doesn't happen it happens I can

6856.74 --> 6860.01
observe it what you're talking about

6858.18 --> 6862.860000000001
that's nonsense it's not doesn't happen

6860.01 --> 6864.45
it's not real it's not that it's not

6862.86 --> 6866.07
happening is that the example you gave

6864.45 --> 6869.76
of specific density or what we call

6866.07 --> 6871.92
specific gravity sorry it about gravity

6869.76 --> 6874.14
I want to know the observed phenomena

6871.92 --> 6876.39
the relative density theory is what

6874.14 --> 6878.04
you're referring to my theory how many

6876.39 --> 6880.92
times that's the last step how many

6878.04 --> 6883.86
times step one

6880.92 --> 6884.719
I'm gonna speak really slowly for you

6883.86 --> 6887.8099999999995
Kyle

6884.719 --> 6892.46
the man of science so Kyle

6887.81 --> 6897.71
step one in the scientific method is to

6892.46 --> 6901.31
observe a natural phenomena in order to

6897.71 --> 6902.57
end with theory so where did this

6901.31 --> 6907.280000000001
journey begin

6902.57 --> 6912.17
what was the observed phenomena was that

6907.28 --> 6914.96
slow enough for you scientist oh you're

6912.17 --> 6917.09
okay right so the observed phenomena is

6914.96 --> 6919.04
the example of the keys I understand

6917.09 --> 6921.02
that you've already said that was what

6919.04 --> 6922.37
was the word you used you cause that you

6921.02 --> 6924.650000000001
dropped the keys you telling me that the

6922.37 --> 6927.11
side ticking the scientific community on

6924.65 --> 6929.12
walking that's not an observable

6927.11 --> 6931.429999999999
phenomena you dropped the keys that's

6929.12 --> 6934.46
not natural come on Dominic over there

6931.43 --> 6938.5
come on you can you can drop it yeah you

6934.46 --> 6938.5
can that's the cause you dropping them

6939.25 --> 6958.43
it has been a pleasure talking to you

6941.39 --> 6960.110000000001
but I'm gonna say my piece he is just as

6958.43 --> 6962.900000000001
a man of science declared that dropping

6960.11 --> 6964.3099999999995
keys is a natural phenomena that doesn't

6962.9 --> 6968.389999999999
make him a scientist that makes it a

6964.31 --> 6971.18
[ __ ] Wow right okay I was just trying

6968.39 --> 6974.329000000001
to give an example of gravity if yeah a

6971.18 --> 6974.329000000001
[Applause]

6975.1 --> 6980.93
bird landing I've just said it three

6977.36 --> 6982.61
times a bird landing give me you're

6980.93 --> 6985.85
telling me that the natural phenomena is

6982.61 --> 6987.41
bird landing so it's okay no worries so

6985.85 --> 6989.42
you're gonna give me the cause of bird

6987.41 --> 6991.4
landing what the hell's that got to do

6989.42 --> 6992.9
with gravity you wanted an example of

6991.4 --> 6994.489
gravity acting in day to day life yeah

6992.9 --> 6996.349999999999
you're gonna bury a manipulating

6994.489 --> 6998.239
independent variable to cause the bird

6996.35 --> 7000.160000000001
to land are you an idiot you think you

6998.239 --> 7001.929999999999
can vary a single independent variable a

7000.16 --> 7007.09
quarter bird to land they appreciate

7001.93 --> 7009.1900000000005
having you you can stay I'm gonna end

7007.09 --> 7011.05
the show I'm gonna leave the back panel

7009.19 --> 7014.669999999999
anyway keep on the schedule if you like

7011.05 --> 7017.41
but yeah there's no science from his ass

7014.67 --> 7018.55
actually phenomena that he's gonna used

7017.41 --> 7020.26
to give me a proof

7018.55 --> 7021.7300000000005
of gravity tells me bird landing he

7020.26 --> 7023.38
thinks it's gonna bury a manipulate an

7021.73 --> 7025.928999999999
independent variable no it's cause the

7023.38 --> 7033.400000000001
bird landing you want an example of

7025.929 --> 7036.909
gravity I'm enough of that yeah Nathan

7033.4 --> 7040.179
no no Nathan I know what you do you do

7036.909 --> 7044.589999999999
it well but yeah this not really your

7040.179 --> 7048.4490000000005
show and there yeah maybe they should go

7044.59 --> 7051.88
and have a debates as they say because

7048.449 --> 7056.71
yeah but hey Nathan was on target though

7051.88 --> 7060.369
this guy was doing exactly look I

7056.71 --> 7063.13
basically politely told him at the start

7060.369 --> 7067.449
what he was doing how I would approach

7063.13 --> 7071.11
it and we just politely agreed yeah that

7067.449 --> 7073.71
is what he is doing and he can't really

7071.11 --> 7075.94
answer certain direct questions and

7073.71 --> 7079.78
Nathan then came in and start to

7075.94 --> 7082.509999999999
actually hammer it in Nathan style which

7079.78 --> 7084.94
is kind of disruptive funny thing this

7082.51 --> 7086.79
show setting so I'm gonna run it I'm not

7084.94 --> 7088.449
gonna let that go on for another hour

7086.79 --> 7091.119
just give me a headache

7088.449 --> 7092.98
even though it was pretty straight on

7091.119 --> 7095.17
but I don't think it's really fair for

7092.98 --> 7099.94
this guy because it was his very first

7095.17 --> 7103.51
appearance on a show so yeah but oh well

7099.94 --> 7105.909
it happened I hope he forgives me for ya

7103.51 --> 7108.25
letting that happen probably doesn't

7105.909 --> 7113.579
appreciate it I'll talk to him on over

7108.25 --> 7118.239
on Skype after this all right

7113.579 --> 7124.449
so yeah Wow it's been going to hours

7118.239 --> 7127.808999999999
it's pretty amazing yeah I was

7124.449 --> 7132.629999999999

7151.749 --> 7158.26
always on Saturday Sunday and I will be

7156.429 --> 7162.9400000000005

7158.26 --> 7165.999
number 131 oh yeah don't forget if you

7162.94 --> 7167.86
want to be part of the panel like Kyle

7165.999 --> 7170.829
was today in peanuts Clark and even

7167.86 --> 7173.28
Nathan then add me on skype the Skype

7170.829 --> 7176.409
address is in the description box below

7173.28 --> 7179.889
and yeah if you want to support my

7176.409 --> 7182.92
endeavors and my show and help me expand

7179.889 --> 7187.6900000000005
my equipment then please donate to my

7182.92 --> 7190.119
super chat and also to my paypal the

7187.69 --> 7193.78
paypal description is in the infobox

7190.119 --> 7197.11
below as well so yeah no debates today

7193.78 --> 7200.889
maybe oh yeah there is a global poll

7197.11 --> 7204.098999999999
Buster's tonight so yeah I'm gonna keep

7200.889 --> 7211.7390000000005
a lookout for that and yeah other than

7204.099 --> 7211.7390000000005
that until the next time keep it flat

7213.02 --> 7243.779
