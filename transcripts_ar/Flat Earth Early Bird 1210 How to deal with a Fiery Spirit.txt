138.08 --> 140.56
not just

141.44 --> 143.84
nice

150.08 --> 152.959
it's not a lot of wind

151.76 --> 154.72
although it's not

152.959 --> 157.72
wind still

154.72 --> 157.72
just

158.08 --> 162.8
a couple of clouds in that beautiful

160.239 --> 165.28
bright blue sky up there isn't it just

162.8 --> 165.28
something

165.68 --> 170.4
sun shining bright

167.44 --> 171.76
oh yeah and the trees here seem to

170.4 --> 175.59900000000002
be

171.76 --> 178.319
about to break out and blossom like even

175.599 --> 180.48
the tree on the left there

178.319 --> 182.879
is starting to

180.48 --> 186.159
get a couple of flowers the other ones

182.879 --> 188.07999999999998
almost going to full bloom i hope no

186.159 --> 191.12
there's nothing wrong with that trees or

188.08 --> 191.12
something they might be

191.2 --> 193.67999999999998
i don't know

194.959 --> 199.04
might be having some blossoming issues

196.879 --> 200.959
or something i don't know what it is

199.04 --> 203.44
usually when it blossoms it's like

200.959 --> 206.56
suddenly out of nowhere it's just fully

203.44 --> 208.879
pink blossom on those things but

206.56 --> 208.879
i don't

210.84 --> 215.76
know right

213.84 --> 218.799
but yeah beautiful weather went out for

215.76 --> 218.79899999999998
groceries in this

220.0 --> 228.64
well yeah it is also hailing

223.28 --> 228.64000000000001
it it was even this morning that's weird

230.72 --> 234.08
it's like oh

231.84 --> 235.84
good morning i got up pretty early today

234.08 --> 238.4
actually

235.84 --> 240.64000000000001
like 11 o'clock

238.4 --> 242.959
and then like this giant hailstorm just

240.64 --> 246.95899999999997
came out of nowhere

242.959 --> 249.599
but yeah that all melted away in

246.959 --> 249.599
10 minutes

250.4 --> 252.87900000000002
anyway

253.76 --> 257.519
it is very

255.36 --> 260.79900000000004
april weather

257.519 --> 264.32
hello psych bear first in chat

260.799 --> 267.32
dr harpy cord

264.32 --> 267.32
hello

272.8 --> 279.479
it is saturday

274.88 --> 279.479
the 9th of april 2022

282.56 --> 286.96
all right and i'm really happy about

284.479 --> 287.919
that sun

286.96 --> 289.03999999999996
yeah

287.919 --> 291.68
i really

289.04 --> 291.68
needed that

293.28 --> 297.55999999999995
just to get out of that restlessness

300.32 --> 304.96
man yesterday's show

303.36 --> 305.91900000000004
yeah that did not

304.96 --> 308.79999999999995
went

305.919 --> 311.84
as i actually planned it at all what

308.8 --> 314.16
planned it is a big word

311.84 --> 316.4
because i actually just wanted to talk

314.16 --> 316.40000000000003
about

317.199 --> 322.0
like

319.28 --> 324.55999999999995
life perspective

322.0 --> 325.759
and like what it's what it would have

324.56 --> 328.16
been like

325.759 --> 330.08000000000004
for these people and all that

328.16 --> 333.03900000000004
but then

330.08 --> 334.88
like as i was doing it

333.039 --> 337.59999999999997
i just got

334.88 --> 341.12
into like i got inflamed and that was

337.6 --> 341.12
really not good at all

345.12 --> 349.84000000000003
so yeah afterward

346.88 --> 353.12
there was all kinds of things went wrong

349.84 --> 355.19899999999996
it's weird like even i had just

353.12 --> 356.0
friction with the guys at fed even

355.199 --> 357.759
though

356.0 --> 359.919
they did get it

357.759 --> 362.16
we didn't talk about it afterward but

359.919 --> 362.15999999999997
just

363.6 --> 366.6
ah

372.639 --> 377.28000000000003
right but yeah what i had sort of

375.44 --> 379.52
envisioned

377.28 --> 382.88
during my show yesterday just didn't

379.52 --> 385.28
work out because i got enraged

382.88 --> 388.08
and that completely ruined

385.28 --> 390.31899999999996
what i could have made with that

388.08 --> 392.71999999999997
just got everybody triggered and then i

390.319 --> 395.03900000000004
got like pissed off

392.72 --> 399.28000000000003
at that and then it was just kind of

395.039 --> 399.28
trigger baiting after a point and that's

400.72 --> 407.72
not really that useful

404.24 --> 407.72
to make a point

408.56 --> 412.56
i mean we got enough

410.319 --> 416.24
pissed off people out there

412.56 --> 416.24
that are not getting a grip already

418.639 --> 423.84000000000003
so yeah i've been kind of thinking about

421.039 --> 423.84
that

429.919 --> 436.52
and about like what am i gonna do over

432.4 --> 436.52
here on this show you know

436.56 --> 440.08
what am i gonna do with all this

440.16 --> 444.0
like

441.039 --> 446.56
my future if i'm ever like gonna try to

444.0 --> 447.919
climb some kind of a more public ladder

446.56 --> 450.56
it's gonna be

447.919 --> 453.35999999999996
such a mess

450.56 --> 456.08
because if they want to want to do you

453.36 --> 458.16
know if they want to make me look crazy

456.08 --> 460.4
i've pretty much given them all the

458.16 --> 461.84000000000003
material they could ever

460.4 --> 463.52
hope to find

461.84 --> 466.87899999999996
to do that

463.52 --> 466.87899999999996
and i did it on purpose

467.759 --> 473.68
even though yeah

470.319 --> 475.84000000000003
i did also fill it out with some just

473.68 --> 478.639
really good well thought out detailed

475.84 --> 481.52
information on the side of that but yeah

478.639 --> 483.599
if somebody just wants to [ __ ] me over

481.52 --> 485.84
if i'm going to go public with something

483.599 --> 489.12
and they don't want it

485.84 --> 491.11999999999995
then they could just use all that [ __ ]

489.12 --> 493.84000000000003
and

491.12 --> 493.84000000000003
yeah

498.56 --> 502.08
what am i gonna do about it i mean i

500.8 --> 504.639
could just be

502.08 --> 507.84
super super

504.639 --> 507.84000000000003
super calm somehow

508.0 --> 513.76
cut off my rage forever somehow

512.159 --> 514.8
i don't know if i could even survive

513.76 --> 517.4399999999999
that

514.8 --> 522.64
and then just say in such a moment like

517.44 --> 525.7600000000001
yeah i was pretty uh pretty out there

522.64 --> 527.92
and it was it would be true

525.76 --> 527.92
but

528.399 --> 532.48
i don't think that wouldn't matter even

530.48 --> 534.88
like people would probably be too

532.48 --> 537.519
shocked

534.88 --> 537.519
by seeing

537.6 --> 544.32
the isolate the isolated craziness

542.0 --> 546.0
i mean it's not going to be hard to edit

544.32 --> 547.6800000000001
[ __ ] together and make me look like a

546.0 --> 550.16
crazy person right

547.68 --> 553.1999999999999
like the trolls out there

550.16 --> 553.1999999999999
already doing that

558.959 --> 564.4799999999999
can you imagine if somebody actually put

561.36 --> 564.48
effort into doing that

565.44 --> 570.08
so yeah what am i gonna do with that

568.56 --> 572.4799999999999
have i just

570.08 --> 574.5
effectively shot myself in the foot

572.48 --> 576.0
forever

574.5 --> 580.0
[Music]

576.0 --> 580.0
i do wonder about these things

582.72 --> 587.839
or is are people in the future just

585.76 --> 590.24
gonna be okay with like oh yeah yeah

587.839 --> 591.519
yeah okay i'm arwin's just a crazy

590.24 --> 594.0
person

591.519 --> 596.53
or rather he has emotional issues which

594.0 --> 598.72
is true and i've even admitted that

596.53 --> 602.079
[Music]

598.72 --> 603.2
is that gonna help anybody

602.079 --> 605.8389999999999
is that gonna

603.2 --> 605.839
help me

605.95 --> 609.009
[Music]

612.079 --> 614.399
i mean

614.72 --> 617.36
i know you guys that follow me and all

616.56 --> 620.4799999999999
that

617.36 --> 623.279
i know you're very sympathetic

620.48 --> 623.279
i know you

624.16 --> 627.519
get me in a certain way

630.64 --> 634.079
and i really appreciate that

637.2 --> 641.9200000000001
i just don't know really

640.0 --> 644.92
what's gonna grow all out out of this

641.92 --> 644.92
hole

649.68 --> 654.3199999999999
hey yeah mike sudanich by the way and

652.16 --> 656.3199999999999
thank you psych bear for the comment

654.32 --> 658.5600000000001
let them use it against you

656.32 --> 660.24
[ __ ] them i'll go through moments of

658.56 --> 662.16
anger

660.24 --> 664.88
yeah

662.16 --> 668.0
but not everybody

664.88 --> 671.0
does it like i do

668.0 --> 671.0
right

674.34 --> 677.399
[Music]

678.8 --> 682.8
right

680.0 --> 684.8
i mean most people when they get really

682.8 --> 687.04
angry and ballistic

684.8 --> 689.279
people are like oh it's like a

687.04 --> 691.68
bull going out of control or something

689.279 --> 695.04
right they don't know what they're doing

691.68 --> 699.399
with me it's not like that

695.04 --> 699.399
i just kind of get very devilish

702.399 --> 705.68
people

703.36 --> 711.0
that tend to act like that in the real

705.68 --> 711.0
world just scare people

724.639 --> 729.16
and they don't end up with a lot of

726.16 --> 729.16
friends

736.959 --> 739.5189999999999
all right yeah thank you borders boy

738.639 --> 742.0
hello

739.519 --> 745.839
so yes there was a great real duck in

742.0 --> 745.839
down into the property yeah

745.92 --> 750.0
that's true that's what i tried borders

747.76 --> 752.56
by and thank thank thank you that you

750.0 --> 752.56
got that

753.04 --> 755.279
but

757.44 --> 761.7600000000001
it wasn't

758.959 --> 764.079
that successful really i mean yeah sure

761.76 --> 766.3199999999999
the info got across

764.079 --> 768.8
those that are like

766.32 --> 770.88
kind of weaponized against

768.8 --> 772.7199999999999
triggered people and all that that know

770.88 --> 774.48
how to deal with that i think you are

772.72 --> 776.24
one of those people

774.48 --> 779.279
and more of you guys that typically

776.24 --> 781.04
follow me right you must be able to take

779.279 --> 782.959
like a bit of a

781.04 --> 788.8
a punch

782.959 --> 788.8
because i wildly punch i just do that

793.519 --> 797.12
so i think i got my point across with

795.519 --> 800.76
you guys

797.12 --> 800.76
but out there

807.76 --> 810.3199999999999
i don't know

810.56 --> 816.7199999999999
maybe i'm just

812.639 --> 819.6
kind of having a pessimistic view on it

816.72 --> 819.6
i don't know what it is

820.32 --> 823.279
also

821.279 --> 828.04
a guy in in the coffee that works at the

823.279 --> 828.04
coffee shop asked me about my channel

828.399 --> 832.8
that was kind of weird so i yeah i gave

830.8 --> 835.199
him my channel then i realized like oh

832.8 --> 835.199
[ __ ]

835.839 --> 842.0790000000001
i think the guy might be gay

838.88 --> 845.4399999999999
i hope i'm not real nap he's a pretty

842.079 --> 847.199
cool guy i just hope i'm not gonna

845.44 --> 849.7600000000001
he's not gonna be shocked at what kind

847.199 --> 852.3199999999999
of a freak i can can be

849.76 --> 854.0
even though i never act like that in

852.32 --> 857.839
public

854.0 --> 857.839
i would never do that

858.16 --> 863.04
i mean i might get a little like hmm

861.839 --> 865.0400000000001
annoyed

863.04 --> 867.519
and then i might get a little louder

865.04 --> 869.4399999999999
right i do like raise my voice sometimes

867.519 --> 870.8
a bit there's like some argument

869.44 --> 872.8800000000001
somebody says something that's

870.8 --> 875.279
completely ill-informed

872.88 --> 877.279
and i want to correct them quickly

875.279 --> 879.8389999999999
i might put up a tone

877.279 --> 883.279
but just the way i go about on here it

879.839 --> 883.2790000000001
gets pretty savage

883.519 --> 887.04
i mean it could be worse

885.36 --> 887.839
but maybe that's it

887.04 --> 889.76
right

887.839 --> 891.6800000000001
what are people gonna freaking compare

889.76 --> 894.16
me with i mean there's plenty of

891.68 --> 896.16
completely mentally deranged and

894.16 --> 898.959
emotionally deranged people out there on

896.16 --> 901.4399999999999
the internet that are just like really

898.959 --> 903.5999999999999
just deranged right

901.44 --> 906.1600000000001
they're there they're they still do

903.6 --> 906.16
their thing

906.24 --> 909.9590000000001
nobody really cares

912.079 --> 916.8
there's some pretty deranged people out

913.839 --> 919.2790000000001
there is that are they gonna just

916.8 --> 921.3599999999999
compare me to that and then think like

919.279 --> 923.36
oh yeah he's a bit of that but he's at

921.36 --> 925.1990000000001
least he makes a point is that what

923.36 --> 926.8000000000001
people are gonna think

925.199 --> 929.199
or are they gonna think

926.8 --> 931.4399999999999
like dude he is just another one of

929.199 --> 933.4399999999999
these crazy people and the triggering

931.44 --> 935.6
basically numbs them down so they don't

933.44 --> 937.9200000000001
even pick up on the

935.6 --> 942.6

by the way for those wondering what i'm

1062.24 --> 1067.52
doing here i'm autistically

1064.96 --> 1069.3600000000001
arranging blueberries in hexagonal

1067.52 --> 1072.799
patterns

1069.36 --> 1074.3999999999999
it's something i tend to do

1072.799 --> 1077.28
see

1074.4 --> 1079.7900000000002
i gotta do that

1077.28 --> 1082.859
i don't know why

1079.79 --> 1082.859
[Music]

1089.28 --> 1095.08
hello by the way jeff gas had seeking

1091.76 --> 1095.08
star wars

1105.84 --> 1108.84
huh

1109.12 --> 1114.3999999999999
that's

1110.16 --> 1114.4
fascinating seeking star wars

1116.96 --> 1124.16
cart 13 the advertisary

1121.76 --> 1126.799
suppressed become demons

1124.16 --> 1129.799
that's a very interesting way of saying

1126.799 --> 1129.799
it

1146.4 --> 1151.1200000000001
what looks like the james webb telescope

1148.72 --> 1154.44
what what what are you talking about

1151.12 --> 1154.4399999999998
jeff gassett

1173.84 --> 1176.08
right

1176.84 --> 1181.76
anyway i'd love to

1179.039 --> 1183.919
blueberry patterns yeah yeah wait you

1181.76 --> 1185.919
know what's even sillier

1183.919 --> 1188.4
every time now with the blueberry i'm

1185.919 --> 1190.5590000000002
constantly hearing like putin singing

1188.4 --> 1193.8400000000001
blueberry hill

1190.559 --> 1193.84
that's weird

1198.85 --> 1201.9499999999998
[Music]

1206.88 --> 1210.48
right i did get blueberries again by the

1208.799 --> 1213.679
way because

1210.48 --> 1216.08
the last time i had him

1213.679 --> 1217.8400000000001
they did something like really good for

1216.08 --> 1219.76
me

1217.84 --> 1222.6399999999999
because i have

1219.76 --> 1224.24
kind of stomach issues regularly

1222.64 --> 1226.48
i don't even really talk about it

1224.24 --> 1230.0
anymore

1226.48 --> 1231.52
because i've had that for so long

1230.0 --> 1233.039
it might have something to do with that

1231.52 --> 1236.6399999999999
i smoke

1233.039 --> 1240.8799999999999
and maybe two that i drink

1236.64 --> 1240.88
right does get worse when i drink more

1241.6 --> 1246.1589999999999
right that's why i just shouldn't do

1243.28 --> 1247.76
that and i don't in general

1246.159 --> 1249.679
but yeah that time

1247.76 --> 1250.34
that i had them what is it now a few

1249.679 --> 1252.48
days ago

1250.34 --> 1255.1999999999998
[Music]

1252.48 --> 1256.72
i had like some pretty like my stomach

1255.2 --> 1259.039
was kind of painful then i ate those

1256.72 --> 1262.039
blueberries and it just really cleared

1259.039 --> 1262.039
up

1263.52 --> 1267.52
right also

1265.28 --> 1270.32
this should be like the natural season

1267.52 --> 1271.6
for blueberries in the wild right

1270.32 --> 1274.08
or

1271.6 --> 1279.039
is that incorrect are they more of a an

1274.08 --> 1279.039
autumn type of berry i'm not sure now

1279.76 --> 1282.1589999999999
anyway

1288.799 --> 1294.32
what are unhappy cranberries called

1291.6 --> 1294.32
blueberries

1301.919 --> 1306.48
and it's very ironic since cranberries

1304.4 --> 1308.64
are kind of sour

1306.48 --> 1310.159
and blueberries are not

1308.64 --> 1311.8400000000001
that's kind of weird

1310.159 --> 1317.0
when you think about that hello by the

1311.84 --> 1317.0
way sound even sound these banana can

1332.4 --> 1337.2
yeah yeah psych bear good point

1335.2 --> 1338.96
right

1337.2 --> 1342.0800000000002
side effects of learning that one of the

1338.96 --> 1344.559
side effects of learning the truth

1342.08 --> 1347.9189999999999
is anger at those perpetrating those

1344.559 --> 1350.48
lies upon you it's not hard

1347.919 --> 1352.64
hard it's hard not to want vengeance

1350.48 --> 1354.48
upon the wicked people right

1352.64 --> 1356.0800000000002
well for me it's not even about

1354.48 --> 1359.2
vengeance right

1356.08 --> 1362.559
when i get like full blast rage win

1359.2 --> 1365.6000000000001
like final solution style

1362.559 --> 1369.6789999999999
it's not even anger at the people it's

1365.6 --> 1371.9189999999999
just i just want them out of the way

1369.679 --> 1371.919
right

1372.08 --> 1375.84
it's like i don't even care

1376.559 --> 1383.12
it's just like they're so in the way

1380.64 --> 1387.44
i just want them out

1383.12 --> 1389.4399999999998
i just want peop i want people to stop

1387.44 --> 1394.24
being forced

1389.44 --> 1396.3200000000002
to be preoccupied with their derangement

1394.24 --> 1398.0
because they happen to be put in a place

1396.32 --> 1400.6399999999999
of control

1398.0 --> 1401.36
that's what really feeds my anger it's

1400.64 --> 1404.64
the

1401.36 --> 1407.76
gross inefficiency of all of it it i

1404.64 --> 1409.8400000000001
don't care about the freaks i don't care

1407.76 --> 1412.559
like i

1409.84 --> 1414.32
i almost have no feeling against them

1412.559 --> 1416.72
anymore at all

1414.32 --> 1419.6789999999999
i just want them gone

1416.72 --> 1423.3600000000001
just get them out of the way

1419.679 --> 1426.48
right i'm more pissed off at the people

1423.36 --> 1429.36
that whine and blabber about them all

1426.48 --> 1432.64
day long and then end up not really

1429.36 --> 1432.6399999999999
doing anything about it

1433.12 --> 1437.6789999999999
and i see a lot of that

1436.08 --> 1439.6789999999999
like

1437.679 --> 1442.5590000000002
just comment section that's what it's

1439.679 --> 1444.72
all it that it that's what it all is now

1442.559 --> 1447.76
that's what everybody's doing

1444.72 --> 1451.919
oh i'm the best i'm gonna write this

1447.76 --> 1455.76
epic speech on how pointless it is that

1451.919 --> 1458.4
what this person is doing and i'm like

1455.76 --> 1459.679
why don't you actually do something

1458.4 --> 1461.8400000000001
about it

1459.679 --> 1464.159
instead of perfecting

1461.84 --> 1466.72
whining about it

1464.159 --> 1468.24
and yes it is kind of ironic

1466.72 --> 1470.799
since

1468.24 --> 1472.64
you could say that that is exactly what

1470.799 --> 1474.6399999999999
i'm doing as well

1472.64 --> 1478.3200000000002
hooray

1474.64 --> 1478.3200000000002
and the paradox goes full

1484.84 --> 1490.08
circle try using more apples and

1487.6 --> 1492.6399999999999
unsweetened apple juice

1490.08 --> 1493.6
i don't drink sweetened apple juice ever

1492.64 --> 1496.64
but

1493.6 --> 1496.6399999999999
apples you say

1497.52 --> 1501.279
hmm

1499.6 --> 1503.6789999999999
i don't really eat a lot of apples

1501.279 --> 1503.679
anymore

1504.64 --> 1509.76
but maybe it is also a seasonal thing

1507.679 --> 1511.6000000000001
some season some things are just good

1509.76 --> 1514.8799999999999
others it just

1511.6 --> 1517.4399999999998
because i have memories of eating apples

1514.88 --> 1519.44
and then they actually not feeling very

1517.44 --> 1521.8400000000001
good in my stomach

1519.44 --> 1523.8400000000001
because of their natural sourness like

1521.84 --> 1526.799
even the sweet ones have natural

1523.84 --> 1529.12
sourness in them and

1526.799 --> 1532.1589999999999
yeah

1529.12 --> 1536.08
because of that lifetime association i

1532.159 --> 1536.0800000000002
just don't really eat a lot of apples

1540.799 --> 1545.12
but if i do eat them it's usually like

1542.96 --> 1548.08
during the summer time because then it's

1545.12 --> 1550.7199999999998
like fresh it's fresh and

1548.08 --> 1550.72
refreshing

1551.279 --> 1555.36
nice and juicy

1552.88 --> 1555.3600000000001
anyway

1555.44 --> 1558.24
thanks for the tip

1560.24 --> 1565.279
the peptides

1563.039 --> 1565.279
okay

1566.08 --> 1571.84
are you talking about apples or about

1568.0 --> 1571.84
the blueberries which one is it

1579.76 --> 1586.32
globe berries

1581.84 --> 1588.3999999999999
are derp berries dude dirt berries

1586.32 --> 1592.8799999999999
are like mamberries

1588.4 --> 1592.88
remember that episode from south park

1596.559 --> 1600.48
those are kind of like derp berries

1607.52 --> 1610.799
i have no idea if you remember any of

1609.2 --> 1612.64
that

1610.799 --> 1615.6
was just one episode

1612.64 --> 1615.6000000000001
pretty freaky one

1625.76 --> 1629.679
i remember hey at least you

1639.36 --> 1644.32
it is true though because

1641.919 --> 1646.3200000000002
they are kind of numpty berries

1644.32 --> 1648.48
or what is it

1646.32 --> 1650.32
dirtberries

1648.48 --> 1652.88
because when you eat them you become

1650.32 --> 1655.36
dumb like in south park mamma berries

1652.88 --> 1657.919
this just make you dream about nostalgic

1655.36 --> 1663.0
[ __ ] and make you stop paying attention

1657.919 --> 1663.0
so they are really kind of dirt berries

1677.52 --> 1680.76
hey crockett

1689.36 --> 1695.4799999999998
hello dr harp

1691.44 --> 1695.48

1730.24 --> 1734.88

the after after show

1742.0 --> 1748.159
then i usually transition into like

1744.72 --> 1751.3990000000001
watching infowars alex jones

1748.159 --> 1751.3990000000001
live streams

1752.32 --> 1756.399
sometimes it's really good some and

1754.24 --> 1759.039
informative sometimes it's just super

1756.399 --> 1762.4799999999998
annoying or like oh political oh let's

1759.039 --> 1766.6
talk about january 6 some more oh yes oh

that's so interesting

1766.64 --> 1768.88
right

1769.76 --> 1772.399
but

1770.55 --> 1773.9189999999999
[Music]

1772.399 --> 1775.4399999999998
yeah

1773.919 --> 1776.98
besides that

1775.44 --> 1778.8400000000001
watching owen benjamin

1776.98 --> 1782.96
[Music]

1778.84 --> 1785.84
uh made by jim bob it was really rising

1782.96 --> 1789.279
up man he's like he's really going

1785.84 --> 1792.32
places right now he's got so much focus

1789.279 --> 1792.32
i'm kind of jealous

1792.88 --> 1798.5590000000002
but yeah you know

1796.24 --> 1800.72
if you're not mentally deranged or

1798.559 --> 1805.08
emotionally deranged yeah you gotta use

1800.72 --> 1805.08
it so i'm not gonna blame him

1814.399 --> 1819.52
i mean yeah if you're just stable and

1817.44 --> 1821.6000000000001
crushing it what's stopping you from

1819.52 --> 1823.84
just growing up

1821.6 --> 1823.84
you know

1826.32 --> 1830.799
and i really like jim bob i think he's

1828.559 --> 1832.32
awesome and he's one of the people that

1830.799 --> 1834.96
i think

1832.32 --> 1838.559
actually gets me

1834.96 --> 1838.559
i i hang around in this chat

1838.88 --> 1846.0800000000002
and i don't feel any like off vibes i

1842.64 --> 1849.279
think he's just seeing me as like a

1846.08 --> 1851.039
generally misunderstood autistic person

1849.279 --> 1852.0
and he knows how to deal with that i

1851.039 --> 1855.6
guess

1852.0 --> 1855.6
and i really appreciate that

1857.279 --> 1862.08
i mean in a way i am

1859.6 --> 1862.08
i get it

1862.24 --> 1866.64
it's just kind of weird because it's not

1864.08 --> 1868.96
really super on the surface but yeah if

1866.64 --> 1873.44
you hang around long enough i'll do

1868.96 --> 1875.76
[ __ ] that's very out of the norm

1873.44 --> 1879.48
even for alternative

1875.76 --> 1879.48
oriented people

1882.32 --> 1885.039
or am i

1885.12 --> 1889.5189999999998
i don't even know anymore

1887.84 --> 1893.84
i don't even know if people out there

1889.519 --> 1893.84
know anymore what's normal now

1901.679 --> 1904.679
haha

1906.24 --> 1909.559
look at that

1931.56 --> 1934.609
[Music]

1938.72 --> 1942.6000000000001
okay it leads you

1953.36 --> 1956.24
oh yeah also

1958.159 --> 1963.3990000000001
that is really weird brett thing

1965.69 --> 1968.779
[Music]

1971.519 --> 1977.44
what are you gonna name this

1974.32 --> 1981.36
but it's like sort of a bread thingy but

1977.44 --> 1984.0
it was like 99 cents so it's like what

1981.36 --> 1987.519
like that's with that weight and it's

1984.0 --> 1989.36
organic and 99 cents that's crazy

1987.519 --> 1994.44
so i'm kind of curious as to what it is

1989.36 --> 1994.4399999999998
oh did my camera just freeze god dammit

2004.399 --> 2008.399
right don't know if you saw that but

2006.08 --> 2008.399
yeah

2013.36 --> 2020.24
borg burgundy tomato

2017.84 --> 2022.9599999999998
that's what it's called

2020.24 --> 2024.0
translated roughly from dutch

2022.96 --> 2026.64
and

2024.0 --> 2029.2
it smells kind of delicious and for 99

2026.64 --> 2033.24
cent and organic that's crazy so i

2029.2 --> 2033.24
thought i'd try that out

2037.679 --> 2041.279
yeah at your stanford

2039.279 --> 2043.6
on one day

2041.279 --> 2046.24
maybe one day you might just stop

2043.6 --> 2048.7999999999997
complaining about it

2046.24 --> 2051.04
i mean i already complain

2048.8 --> 2053.9190000000003
no need

2051.04 --> 2053.919
to add to that

2054.56 --> 2061.839
yeah also usb drivers that's super cute

2058.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
doesn't work

2084.24 --> 2088.839
hey adam meekin by the way

2119.52 --> 2122.839
hey kevlar

2133.2 --> 2136.3999999999996
yeah the blueberries are certainly

2134.72 --> 2139.3999999999996
hitting the spot

2136.4 --> 2139.4
delicious

2166.56 --> 2168.96
all right

2169.92 --> 2176.8
you know it still baffles me to this day

2173.92 --> 2181.04
when i watch other people's shows

2176.8 --> 2182.96
how they manage to just keep going

2181.04 --> 2184.4
and not like have moments where they're

2182.96 --> 2188.03
just silent

2184.4 --> 2190.32
i don't understand how they could do it

2188.03 --> 2193.44
[Music]

2190.32 --> 2197.599
owen is a master at it i mean he never

2193.44 --> 2198.8
shuts up if he doesn't have to brilliant

2197.599 --> 2201.76
jim bob

2198.8 --> 2204.1600000000003
great edit

2201.76 --> 2206.48
the entire infowars crew they're all

2204.16 --> 2209.5989999999997
champions at it even though some are a

2206.48 --> 2211.839
little better at it than others

2209.599 --> 2214.0
because to that at that point it just

2211.839 --> 2216.16
becomes like what are you feeling it

2214.0 --> 2216.16
with

2217.44 --> 2221.68
my issue is

2219.839 --> 2224.64
is that a

2221.68 --> 2227.52
the way i do it i just want to keep all

2224.64 --> 2230.0
room and all clarity to basically

2227.52 --> 2232.96
whenever i put out something

2230.0 --> 2235.04
whenever i analyze something that i do

2232.96 --> 2235.04
it

2235.52 --> 2240.16
like

2236.4 --> 2241.28
on its own level if necessary

2240.16 --> 2243.359
but

2241.28 --> 2245.52
yeah when you then

2243.359 --> 2248.48
put that right next to other moments i

2245.52 --> 2251.04
can just be waiting thinking about

2248.48 --> 2252.88
something for like five to ten seconds

2251.04 --> 2254.88
or even more

2252.88 --> 2257.52
not always coming to a conclusion that i

2254.88 --> 2260.1600000000003
can talk about

2257.52 --> 2263.16
and i never see anybody else have that

2260.16 --> 2263.16
issue

2270.56 --> 2277.52
that jim bob's done pet yeah yeah i know

2274.24 --> 2281.68
it's like barry was amazing

2277.52 --> 2281.68
yesterday was so freaking funny

2281.839 --> 2287.839
especially this segment with the uh the

2285.76 --> 2289.76
guy at the space center

2287.839 --> 2292.72
talking about measuring

2289.76 --> 2294.88
then they did the measurements

2292.72 --> 2297.02
god that cracked me up

2294.88 --> 2300.09
it's so funny

2297.02 --> 2300.09
[Music]

2305.68 --> 2310.7999999999997
yeah jim bob's just

2308.079 --> 2312.5600000000004
really freaking hilarious he just knows

2310.8 --> 2315.44
how to get there

2312.56 --> 2317.92
like that brilliant i wish i got that

2315.44 --> 2319.44
back i used to have that

2317.92 --> 2321.359
in my teens

2319.44 --> 2323.68
where i could just do that right i'd

2321.359 --> 2325.5989999999997
just be like yeah i can do that no

2323.68 --> 2327.2799999999997
problem

2325.599 --> 2330.6400000000003
and then there were some people that

2327.28 --> 2330.6400000000003
didn't really like that about me

2332.88 --> 2335.6800000000003
and they

2333.839 --> 2339.4
pulled me off course

2335.68 --> 2339.3999999999996
to what i'm now

2354.079 --> 2358.88
oh and the owen benjamin moment filler

2357.119 --> 2361.359
what

2358.88 --> 2364.0
oh he has a piano and [ __ ] right so i

2361.359 --> 2368.7599999999998
guess it's very easy to just shut up and

2364.0 --> 2368.76
just play some piano brilliant

2378.88 --> 2383.359
i think that my filler moment is again i

2381.599 --> 2385.76
guess

2383.359 --> 2388.16
arranging blueberries in hexagonal

2385.76 --> 2390.1600000000003
patterns and then showing you guys

2388.16 --> 2393.16
i think that's my special intermission

2390.16 --> 2393.16
moment

2406.72 --> 2410.68
oh good stuff

2428.96 --> 2434.319
what are you talking about tara 306 the

2431.359 --> 2434.319
chat gets stuck

2436.4 --> 2439.7200000000003
that's weird

2448.88 --> 2454.48
yeah just try to refresh did my camera

2452.24 --> 2454.4799999999996
what

2455.119 --> 2459.2400000000002
what the hell no

2478.4 --> 2482.7200000000003
okay youtube chat gets stuck on you

2480.56 --> 2485.119
that's annoying

2482.72 --> 2488.72
well youtube has all kinds of issues uh

2485.119 --> 2491.52
periodically because of updating

2488.72 --> 2492.8799999999997
i think it's just become so big and

2491.52 --> 2494.64
messy

2492.88 --> 2496.96
that they constantly

2494.64 --> 2499.7599999999998
like whenever they update they just put

2496.96 --> 2499.76
back errors

2500.72 --> 2505.2
it typically happens

2502.48 --> 2507.04
so i've heard

2505.2 --> 2509.4399999999996
with like really big

2507.04 --> 2512.64
programs

2509.44 --> 2512.64
if you then update them

2513.2 --> 2517.68
you always end up basically undoing

2516.319 --> 2522.4
fixes

2517.68 --> 2523.839
it it so typically happens out there

2522.4 --> 2526.839
and then you have to do it all over

2523.839 --> 2526.839
again

2538.079 --> 2541.04
okay i'm frozen yeah that's what i saw

2539.92 --> 2545.96
but then

2541.04 --> 2545.96
it then froze again for some reason

2555.92 --> 2560.8
right anyway i'm gonna try to be

2557.28 --> 2560.8
clear-minded today and uh

2561.359 --> 2565.52
turn it into a [ __ ] show again i don't

2563.599 --> 2568.88
think that's gonna happen anyway i got

2565.52 --> 2568.88
blueberry protection now

2570.64 --> 2575.839
but i am pretty concentrated

2574.48 --> 2579.52
compared to

2575.839 --> 2582.0789999999997
the other few days

2579.52 --> 2584.88
so yeah

2582.079 --> 2587.92
i can talk technical if you guys want me

2584.88 --> 2587.92
to address something

2588.72 --> 2593.72
i think there's a new project in the

2590.72 --> 2593.72
weight

2594.079 --> 2598.079
the guys adam meekin mostly was talking

2596.16 --> 2599.92
about it yesterday in the after after

2598.079 --> 2604.28
show

2599.92 --> 2604.28
concerning stellar spectroscopy

2605.599 --> 2610.319
and how that of course is a giant

2607.68 --> 2610.319
nonsense

2610.48 --> 2616.44
divination process that has nothing to

2612.8 --> 2616.44
do with real spectroscopy

2628.079 --> 2631.5600000000004
hello kitty

2645.359 --> 2648.359
meow

2662.079 --> 2665.079
me

2676.88 --> 2680.4
want to go outside kitty

2683.839 --> 2688.359
nope

2685.359 --> 2688.359
okay

2692.48 --> 2697.2
yeah that's right i see colored light

2694.16 --> 2701.359
there for spectroscopy no but it is

2697.2 --> 2705.839
look spectroscopy is a very detailed

2701.359 --> 2705.839
difficult process to do right

2705.92 --> 2709.839
like like material spectroscopy it's

2708.8 --> 2711.2000000000003
very

2709.839 --> 2713.2799999999997
heavy

2711.2 --> 2715.2799999999997
thank you i'm not sure but i think like

2713.28 --> 2716.7200000000003
even it has a vacuum chamber or

2715.28 --> 2718.4
something

2716.72 --> 2720.72
it's a

2718.4 --> 2722.4
pretty extreme process

2720.72 --> 2725.7599999999998
and that's why those machines are very

2722.4 --> 2725.76
expensive so i've heard

2726.4 --> 2731.28
and one of the things is it's like yeah

2728.319 --> 2734.079
you can have a distance

2731.28 --> 2735.8390000000004
so then to just say oh

2734.079 --> 2737.599
i'm just going to

2735.839 --> 2741.2799999999997
take a picture

2737.599 --> 2744.56
practically abso have the light analyzed

2741.28 --> 2746.96
coming from somewhere and then pretend

2744.56 --> 2749.2
like you're actually looking dead on a

2746.96 --> 2751.28
piece of material

2749.2 --> 2754.319
that's what stellar spectroscopy is and

2751.28 --> 2756.4
it is preposterous

2754.319 --> 2759.92
it has nothing to do with

2756.4 --> 2762.96
it's extreme the extreme opposite of

2759.92 --> 2767.599
like the actual difficulty

2762.96 --> 2767.599
of real material spectroscopy

2768.56 --> 2773.44
because

2769.599 --> 2775.839
like it's very easy to watch

2773.44 --> 2776.88
material spectroscopy

2775.839 --> 2779.2799999999997
like if you

2776.88 --> 2781.92
don't like the the pressure is wrong or

2779.28 --> 2784.3190000000004
something and yeah they can mock up and

2781.92 --> 2786.4
then you your readings off right well

2784.319 --> 2788.88
they just think that just like uh we're

2786.4 --> 2791.359
just gonna take some light

2788.88 --> 2795.04
and then we're gonna basically divine it

2791.359 --> 2797.52
like reading tea leaves or bones like oh

2795.04 --> 2800.72
oh well that coral that color sort of

2797.52 --> 2803.599
correlates with the spectroscopy readout

2800.72 --> 2806.7999999999997
of this material so we're gonna assume

2803.599 --> 2806.8
it's that material

2806.88 --> 2813.2000000000003
divining it is divining

2810.88 --> 2814.56
no confirmation of any of it

2813.2 --> 2817.2799999999997
of course

2814.56 --> 2819.2799999999997
they never actually took real samples to

2817.28 --> 2821.6800000000003
confirm anything they said

2819.28 --> 2823.76
about it all the assumptions of what

2821.68 --> 2826.319
kind of material it is consistent of

2823.76 --> 2827.8390000000004
none of it is actually confirmed in any

2826.319 --> 2830.839
way

2827.839 --> 2830.839
so

2833.359 --> 2836.48
oh yeah

2834.319 --> 2838.96
psych bear

2836.48 --> 2841.68
going on with kent hovind yeah i heard

2838.96 --> 2842.96
that's also on the agenda

2841.68 --> 2845.839
who was it

2842.96 --> 2845.839
uh

2847.04 --> 2853.359
i think uh

2849.52 --> 2855.839
our own little measuring man

2853.359 --> 2859.2
refracted curvature who has such a

2855.839 --> 2861.44
lovely measuring accent

2859.2 --> 2861.4399999999996
yeah

2863.2 --> 2868.319
he's he wants to go up against kent

2865.359 --> 2869.7599999999998
hovind and he i think he invited him on

2868.319 --> 2872.079
flat earth debate i don't know if it's

2869.76 --> 2875.2000000000003
gonna happen if kent would actually do

2872.079 --> 2877.8390000000004
that but that would be pretty amazing

2875.2 --> 2881.2
if he do that then i'd be like

2877.839 --> 2883.44
kent dude you got balls you actually got

2881.2 --> 2886.5589999999997
balls not just

2883.44 --> 2888.8
balls in your head

2886.559 --> 2891.76
like that's pretty badass if he would

2888.8 --> 2894.8
actually go on flat earth debate

2891.76 --> 2894.8
i don't know if he'd do it

2897.119 --> 2902.96
it might just be like way too out there

2900.0 --> 2906.079
unchristian too harsh or something

2902.96 --> 2908.88
for him right we do like go over so

2906.079 --> 2910.2400000000002
certain type of lines there just like i

2908.88 --> 2912.48
do

2910.24 --> 2914.5589999999997
and he might be like that's just out of

2912.48 --> 2916.96
control i don't want to associate with

2914.559 --> 2920.48
that at all he could be like that or

2916.96 --> 2923.599
he'd be like no no i've i've seen worse

2920.48 --> 2928.359
i'll just do it lord protect me

2923.599 --> 2928.3590000000004
who knows would be pretty cool i think

2944.24 --> 2949.68
now i'll never forget ken hovind

2946.8 --> 2951.2000000000003
kent hovind is literally the singular

2949.68 --> 2952.319
individual

2951.2 --> 2957.0789999999997
that

2952.319 --> 2957.079
is it now 15 years ago now

2957.2 --> 2960.24
12

2958.8 --> 2962.559
12 years

2960.24 --> 2965.2799999999997
ago

2962.559 --> 2965.28
was it more

2966.8 --> 2969.599
hmm

2968.0 --> 2972.16
it's very hard now

2969.599 --> 2974.7200000000003
it's hard to pinpoint let's just say 12

2972.16 --> 2978.5589999999997
years ago

2974.72 --> 2981.2799999999997
he was really the one that i got into

2978.559 --> 2982.7200000000003
when i figured out creationism

2981.28 --> 2985.119
like

2982.72 --> 2988.5589999999997
that there was actual like

2985.119 --> 2991.599
palpable evidence of creation

2988.559 --> 2992.96
not just like logic based

2991.599 --> 2996.4
right not just

2992.96 --> 2998.64
philosophical based information and

2996.4 --> 3000.96
i learned a lot about fossils and how

2998.64 --> 3004.8799999999997
that's actually things can fossilize

3000.96 --> 3007.359
really quickly and like the petrified

3004.88 --> 3009.92
foot in a boot

3007.359 --> 3013.119
right that sort of thing and just how

3009.92 --> 3016.48
far so read yeah i learned all that

3013.119 --> 3019.52
from kent hovind pretty much

3016.48 --> 3020.88
and i knew a guy was really into him too

3019.52 --> 3022.88
over that

3020.88 --> 3024.88
at the same time then we got into flat

3022.88 --> 3026.96
earth and then he got scared out of flat

3024.88 --> 3029.04
earth but he's still stuck to ken hovind

3026.96 --> 3030.16
because ken hovind is always keeping to

3029.04 --> 3033.44
that ball

3030.16 --> 3036.3999999999996
like everything else is pretty much epic

3033.44 --> 3039.4
but he always sticks to that ball

3036.4 --> 3039.4
right

3042.559 --> 3046.079
but i i kind of want to thank him i

3044.64 --> 3047.92
think i might have already done that in

3046.079 --> 3051.76
like in his chat

3047.92 --> 3053.92
but i do owe him because he is the one

3051.76 --> 3056.0
person that really helped me understand

3053.92 --> 3057.6800000000003
creation

3056.0 --> 3060.079
and make god

3057.68 --> 3063.839
more palpable to me

3060.079 --> 3063.8390000000004
because i knew he was always there

3064.48 --> 3069.04
but he just made it more palpable to me

3067.52 --> 3071.28
and i'm always going to be thankful for

3069.04 --> 3071.2799999999997
that

3071.76 --> 3076.079
even though he says really ridiculous

3073.839 --> 3077.04
things especially about the molten iron

3076.079 --> 3079.92
core

3077.04 --> 3081.92
but that just doesn't matter

3079.92 --> 3084.8
it doesn't matter that much in the face

3081.92 --> 3084.8
of the big picture

3085.119 --> 3089.28
so yeah i'm looking forward to that

3087.52 --> 3093.0
if that's gonna happen

3089.28 --> 3093.0
on the flat earth debate

3109.28 --> 3116.1600000000003
okay psych bear well yes lose respect

3112.24 --> 3116.16
sure if that's how you see that

3117.28 --> 3124.48
i think he's just been

3120.24 --> 3126.0
encapsulated encapsulated by measuring

3124.48 --> 3129.839
people

3126.0 --> 3131.68
right he is like yeah

3129.839 --> 3134.72
they're just they ain't gonna have him

3131.68 --> 3138.9199999999996
if he went to flat earth

3134.72 --> 3138.9199999999996
too many measuring people

3144.93 --> 3148.1099999999997
[Music]

3152.8 --> 3156.0
that's right matt y'all

3156.559 --> 3160.0400000000004
what can you do

3172.55 --> 3176.48
[Music]

3174.48 --> 3179.44
indoctrinated into space race stuff a

3176.48 --> 3182.079
bit much right as i said surrounded by

3179.44 --> 3186.319
measuring people

3182.079 --> 3186.319
people that just measure these things

3190.0 --> 3193.4
okay kitty

3217.44 --> 3221.96
inferior come on derek

3222.64 --> 3227.1189999999997
but yeah

3224.0 --> 3229.839
maybe you're right i mean

3227.119 --> 3232.96
look kent hovind doesn't strike me as

3229.839 --> 3234.319
the type that's like super intellectual

3232.96 --> 3237.599
right

3234.319 --> 3239.7599999999998
i mean his dynamics with the u with

3237.599 --> 3243.76
using words is

3239.76 --> 3245.5200000000004
not super impressive but he is very

3243.76 --> 3248.659
eloquent with what he's

3245.52 --> 3248.659
[Music]

3248.839 --> 3252.72
got and i just don't think

3251.839 --> 3255.68
it's just

3252.72 --> 3258.5589999999997
it just doesn't want to

3255.68 --> 3258.5589999999997
want to go there

3260.96 --> 3264.319
so yeah you could call him

3262.16 --> 3267.359
intellectually inferior but i bet that

3264.319 --> 3270.4
he he could still out debate you on a

3267.359 --> 3270.4
whole bunch of things

3270.88 --> 3276.079
because he i think he does have a very

3273.04 --> 3278.319
good memory overall

3276.079 --> 3281.559
pro yeah he's just it's not the dynamic

3278.319 --> 3281.5589999999997
he's just

3309.52 --> 3311.7599999999998
right

3310.559 --> 3314.079
yeah

3311.76 --> 3316.88
now psych where you're on to something i

3314.079 --> 3316.88
mean people

3318.16 --> 3325.52
that measured accented people tend to

3322.559 --> 3327.92
be very good

3325.52 --> 3331.119
at fooling themselves

3327.92 --> 3335.2000000000003
when it comes to things that they've

3331.119 --> 3336.96
been drawn close to with their heart

3335.2 --> 3339.52
and one of these things is the basically

3336.96 --> 3340.96
the space cowboy effect

3339.52 --> 3342.16
and

3340.96 --> 3344.559
like that's

3342.16 --> 3348.44
like dangerous it's dangerous to

3344.559 --> 3348.44
confront them with that

3351.52 --> 3356.799
it's cultural

3353.839 --> 3359.2
it's cultural like almost religiously

3356.799 --> 3364.7599999999998
cultural not to accept that the earth is

3359.2 --> 3364.7599999999998
flat to them to the measuring people

3381.119 --> 3384.119
so

3400.24 --> 3406.72
make something truthful looks totally

3403.599 --> 3406.7200000000003
ridic what the how

3408.72 --> 3416.72
good like why would it be ridiculous the

3411.92 --> 3416.7200000000003
earth being 7 000 years old i mean

3416.96 --> 3420.64
how do you know

3418.48 --> 3423.68
it is like older than

3420.64 --> 3423.68
300 years

3423.76 --> 3430.7200000000003
with absolute certainty

3426.72 --> 3432.48
like we don't really know for certain

3430.72 --> 3434.319
it's been a while

3432.48 --> 3435.359
people

3434.319 --> 3440.64
can

3435.359 --> 3440.64
fabricate a lot of delusion

3440.72 --> 3446.72
over a short period of time

3443.28 --> 3448.6400000000003
so the more time actually passed the

3446.72 --> 3451.52
more

3448.64 --> 3453.92
the amount of uncertainty because of the

3451.52 --> 3456.24
delusion that could have been created in

3453.92 --> 3459.2000000000003
that time span

3456.24 --> 3461.7599999999998
right fuzzy it up

3459.2 --> 3464.24
after a point you just can never be

3461.76 --> 3466.7990000000004
certain again because anything could

3464.24 --> 3468.4399999999996
have been made up by any generation that

3466.799 --> 3471.599
precedes you

3468.44 --> 3473.76
specifically to fool you

3471.599 --> 3475.76
how the [ __ ] do you even know

3473.76 --> 3478.4
i don't think seven thousand years

3475.76 --> 3480.88
sounds that ridiculous

3478.4 --> 3480.88
then again

3481.119 --> 3486.0
maybe it's

3482.72 --> 3486.0
a million years

3486.079 --> 3490.2400000000002
maybe it's 300 years

3488.799 --> 3492.72
i don't know

3490.24 --> 3495.2799999999997
i mean i'm just because it happens to be

3492.72 --> 3497.5989999999997
the the consensus based

3495.28 --> 3499.119
on what's currently written in a very

3497.599 --> 3501.76
specific book

3499.119 --> 3505.359
doesn't mean that it is like the end-all

3501.76 --> 3507.8390000000004
proof to me right

3505.359 --> 3510.839
but it doesn't seem that ridiculous to

3507.839 --> 3510.839
me

3519.92 --> 3525.2400000000002
missing my point no no i'm not missing

3522.0 --> 3525.24
your point

3537.599 --> 3539.92
nope

3542.88 --> 3545.839
now i got it

3548.64 --> 3551.359
yeah

3549.52 --> 3554.079
i got it

3551.359 --> 3555.7599999999998
you you said that oh he's there to make

3554.079 --> 3559.119
it look ridiculous and then gave an

3555.76 --> 3560.6400000000003
example that isn't actually ridiculous

3559.119 --> 3562.1600000000003
you see

3560.64 --> 3566.24
that's the point you called it

3562.16 --> 3566.24
ridiculous it's not ridiculous

3566.48 --> 3570.64
i think you're the one that didn't that

3568.799 --> 3572.88
missed my point

3570.64 --> 3574.8799999999997
in response to your point

3572.88 --> 3577.2000000000003
because i don't think anything he really

3574.88 --> 3579.44
says is that ridiculous except for the

3577.2 --> 3581.52
time where he addresses the molten iron

3579.44 --> 3584.88
core but even then he just addresses it

3581.52 --> 3588.319
from a very primitive mindset like a kid

3584.88 --> 3588.319
because there is nothing else

3589.359 --> 3595.0
but i don't think kent hovind is like

3592.0 --> 3595.0
ridiculous

3608.48 --> 3615.28
dude yes you did say that let me quote

3611.52 --> 3619.2
you his role is much like flat earth

3615.28 --> 3623.119
society's role making something truthful

3619.2 --> 3627.1189999999997
look totally ridiculous in his case

3623.119 --> 3630.6400000000003
that's the 7 000 year old earth

3627.119 --> 3633.2000000000003
i'm sorry gorzilla

3630.64 --> 3636.839
you seem to for be forgetting what you

3633.2 --> 3636.839
actually said

3645.839 --> 3652.64
to an army dude to enormi everything

3649.44 --> 3652.64
looks ridiculous

3654.4 --> 3661.2000000000003
they don't know

3657.44 --> 3664.7200000000003
and besides normie world right now

3661.2 --> 3668.5589999999997
you think they have any kind of

3664.72 --> 3669.839
standard to approach any information

3668.559 --> 3672.4
without

3669.839 --> 3673.599
at all about anything

3672.4 --> 3677.119
really

3673.599 --> 3679.92
dude there's so much derangement

3677.119 --> 3682.559
rolling around

3679.92 --> 3684.96
they don't think why would they even

3682.559 --> 3686.3190000000004
think such a thing is ridiculous

3684.96 --> 3689.359
at this point

3686.319 --> 3692.0
i mean mainstream media people say

3689.359 --> 3693.2799999999997
things that are like 10 000 times as

3692.0 --> 3696.4
ridiculous

3693.28 --> 3699.6800000000003
and they still accept that

3696.4 --> 3702.0
like i don't think like maybe

3699.68 --> 3704.0
40 years ago right

3702.0 --> 3706.24
if you said that people would have been

3704.0 --> 3708.96
like oh that's so stupid that doesn't

3706.24 --> 3711.5989999999997
make any sense right now it's like

3708.96 --> 3713.92
yeah why not

3711.599 --> 3715.119
is [ __ ] insane anyway it might just

3713.92 --> 3717.039
be true

3715.119 --> 3718.7200000000003
that's what i think i don't think people

3717.039 --> 3721.039
think it's that crazy

3718.72 --> 3723.0389999999998
they only might think it's crazy if

3721.039 --> 3725.44
they're rolling

3723.039 --> 3727.28
through their programming

3725.44 --> 3730.079
when they were told what it's supposed

3727.28 --> 3732.1600000000003
to be although it's billions years old

3730.079 --> 3733.8390000000004
in the dinosaur

3732.16 --> 3736.0
that right

3733.839 --> 3737.839
if they're stuck in that program

3736.0 --> 3740.24
specifically

3737.839 --> 3742.64
then they might have that response but

3740.24 --> 3745.2799999999997
other than that that if they're already

3742.64 --> 3746.72
kind of freed up a bit in their mind

3745.28 --> 3748.079
like okay

3746.72 --> 3749.7599999999998
government's getting [ __ ] up they're

3748.079 --> 3751.3590000000004
really lying they lied about this and

3749.76 --> 3753.599
that hmm

3751.359 --> 3756.0789999999997
those people are gonna be like

3753.599 --> 3757.52
yeah sure seven thousand years old okay

3756.079 --> 3758.96
i'll go with that

3757.52 --> 3762.96
i mean

3758.96 --> 3762.96
does it really matter too much

3767.599 --> 3772.0
they could make better who

3770.4 --> 3772.799
who could

3772.0 --> 3775.28
can

3772.799 --> 3778.72
could make a better case for it how how

3775.28 --> 3780.7200000000003
could he make a better case for it

3778.72 --> 3782.5589999999997
why don't you make a better case for it

3780.72 --> 3785.0389999999998
then gorzilla

3782.559 --> 3788.799
if you could do better than him

3785.039 --> 3793.28
if you know how he should be doing it

3788.799 --> 3794.839
yeah he's not gonna do flat earth

3793.28 --> 3798.88
he's not gonna do

3794.839 --> 3800.96
it if you don't like that then you're

3798.88 --> 3803.52
the one with the problem

3800.96 --> 3803.52
not him

3807.839 --> 3810.96
yeah if

3809.2 --> 3814.0
uh oh i'm

3810.96 --> 3817.76
i'm sorry to go here but i'm a special

3814.0 --> 3820.4
boy flat earther i can only watch things

3817.76 --> 3822.96
where people at least admit the earth is

3820.4 --> 3826.2000000000003
flat and integrated in everything they

3822.96 --> 3829.119
say otherwise i'm gonna have a

3826.2 --> 3831.52
sjw response and be all triggered about

3829.119 --> 3832.88
how they're wrong and it's so stupid

3831.52 --> 3835.359
hello

3832.88 --> 3835.359
hello

3836.799 --> 3841.44
dude

3839.44 --> 3844.799
there will be people throughout your

3841.44 --> 3848.079
lifetime until you die of old age that

3844.799 --> 3850.48
will believe the globe and use its

3848.079 --> 3852.559
[ __ ] vernacular

3850.48 --> 3854.72
and there will be smart people doing

3852.559 --> 3856.079
that and there will be people that are

3854.72 --> 3857.5989999999997
great

3856.079 --> 3859.6800000000003
that do that

3857.599 --> 3860.7200000000003
nothing is going to stop that don't you

3859.68 --> 3864.0
get it

3860.72 --> 3866.8799999999997
it's not going away

3864.0 --> 3870.64
learn about it and then deal with it

3866.88 --> 3873.76
you can't create a flat earth only world

3870.64 --> 3875.68
it's never gonna happen ever in world

3873.76 --> 3879.48
history ever

3875.68 --> 3879.48
again right

3880.079 --> 3883.92
i don't think it even ever did happen

3882.72 --> 3885.5989999999997
really

3883.92 --> 3887.359
that everybody thought that it's just

3885.599 --> 3892.2000000000003
most people didn't really care what the

3887.359 --> 3892.2
[ __ ] the world was who gives a [ __ ]

3900.799 --> 3904.599
he's a shell

3919.119 --> 3924.6400000000003
that's ridiculous not everything in the

3921.599 --> 3925.52
freaking world is about flat earth yeah

3924.64 --> 3927.1189999999997
maybe

3925.52 --> 3928.96
kent just

3927.119 --> 3930.8900000000003
isn't about that

3928.96 --> 3932.0
maybe it's just

3930.89 --> 3933.48
[Music]

3932.0 --> 3936.559
about

3933.48 --> 3939.119
creationism versus evolution

3936.559 --> 3941.28
maybe that's just what he's about

3939.119 --> 3943.599
oh it could be so much better if he's a

3941.28 --> 3946.6400000000003
flat earther dude you know how freaking

3943.599 --> 3948.96
sick everybody is going to get if every

3946.64 --> 3951.0389999999998
freaking person in the media becomes a

3948.96 --> 3955.119
flat earther

3951.039 --> 3957.92
jesus christ that would be unbearable

3955.119 --> 3958.7200000000003
everybody being a flat earther jesus

3957.92 --> 3961.7200000000003
like

3958.72 --> 3961.72
dude

3969.76 --> 3975.28
just let him be

3972.64 --> 3978.48
why do you always have to be annoyed if

3975.28 --> 3980.88
somebody is in the flat earther

3978.48 --> 3983.039
i think you've been staring at anti-flat

3980.88 --> 3985.039
earthers for too long and then you start

3983.039 --> 3987.28
to think that everybody's an anti-flat

3985.039 --> 3989.3590000000004
earther that isn't a flat earther

3987.28 --> 3993.8390000000004
that's not true

3989.359 --> 3993.839
just let them be man

4005.039 --> 4009.2000000000003
that's right tara 306 they wouldn't

4009.839 --> 4015.64
i don't know if they'd go that far but

4011.92 --> 4015.64
yeah point taken

4017.01 --> 4020.1290000000004
[Music]

4041.92 --> 4046.319
no guard seller that's not literally

4043.92 --> 4049.839
what you said but that's what it pretty

4046.319 --> 4049.839
much was expressing

4052.4 --> 4057.839
like why do you care so much

4055.119 --> 4060.4
why are you comparing kent hove into the

4057.839 --> 4067.2799999999997
flat earth society

4060.4 --> 4067.28
he's not it's just not about that

4069.119 --> 4073.359
i mean the flat earth society is a flat

4070.88 --> 4076.96
earth yeah their control opposition yeah

4073.359 --> 4081.24
i get that kent hovind isn't that

4076.96 --> 4081.2400000000002
it's not anything like that

4096.56 --> 4102.2390000000005
i hope not you might be right though

4098.719 --> 4105.12
dude a lot of like mainstream me media

4102.239 --> 4106.799
people i don't even like take glimpses

4105.12 --> 4110.08
at them anymore because they've become

4106.799 --> 4110.08
so mentally deranged

4110.4 --> 4112.639999999999
right

4115.279 --> 4119.359
no he's a shield as

4117.6 --> 4122.08
yeah there you go again

4119.359 --> 4124.159000000001
it's a shell he's a shell

4122.08 --> 4127.199
he's such a shill

4124.159 --> 4131.12
i mean he's being paid to not be a flat

4127.199 --> 4135.199
earther yes of course

4131.12 --> 4137.199
or he's just not going there

4135.199 --> 4139.678999999999
i mean the guy has been in freaking jail

4137.199 --> 4139.678999999999
and [ __ ]

4140.48 --> 4146.159
right he might have a good reason not to

4142.96 --> 4148.56
go there that doesn't make him a globe

4146.159 --> 4148.5599999999995
shill

4149.679 --> 4156.4
yeah you're allowed to think

4152.88 --> 4158.08
but thinking should lead to something a

4156.4 --> 4161.5599999999995
conclusion

4158.08 --> 4161.5599999999995
that's logical

4172.319 --> 4176.56
that's right tara 306 thanks for getting

4174.48 --> 4176.5599999999995

but

4203.44 --> 4207.36
i was just going by your point you just

4205.92 --> 4210.2390000000005
seem to be so

4207.36 --> 4213.12
pissed off that oh and calling him a

4210.239 --> 4216.839999999999
shield like dude do you even read what

4213.12 --> 4216.84
you're writing down

4220.8 --> 4225.650000000001
it just

4222.239 --> 4228.78
it's out of whack man

4225.65 --> 4228.78
[Music]

4233.199 --> 4236.639999999999
because i jump off

4237.84 --> 4240.88
what

4238.88 --> 4242.88
you mean i respond to what you're

4240.88 --> 4245.28
actually saying are you saying you want

4242.88 --> 4247.52
to write things in my chat that i don't

4245.28 --> 4250.4
read and respond to is that what you

4247.52 --> 4253.6
want to do here godzilla

4250.4 --> 4254.719
because i do read what people write in

4253.6 --> 4257.1990000000005
my chat

4254.719 --> 4259.04
even if you think i'm not and you think

4257.199 --> 4261.28
you're having a private conversation

4259.04 --> 4264.0
with somebody else in my chat

4261.28 --> 4267.28
i do not accept you're in my chat it's

4264.0 --> 4270.48
public i will respond to it if i feel

4267.28 --> 4270.48
like it it's what i do

4270.8 --> 4275.6
and i don't discriminate based on your

4273.28 --> 4278.5599999999995
philosophical beliefs

4275.6 --> 4278.56
when it comes to that

4281.36 --> 4285.199
[Music]

4283.84 --> 4287.6
i just

4285.199 --> 4289.36
i don't see what your issue is

4287.6 --> 4292.56
can't

4289.36 --> 4293.5199999999995
yeah he's not a flat earther

4292.56 --> 4295.120000000001
i mean

4293.52 --> 4297.1990000000005
that doesn't make him a shield that

4295.12 --> 4299.5199999999995
doesn't make him controlled opposition

4297.199 --> 4302.629999999999
like the flat earth society or anything

4299.52 --> 4305.81
even close to that

4302.63 --> 4305.81
[Music]

4316.239 --> 4321.44
yeah thank you for that psycbear thank

4318.159 --> 4321.44
you for the support it's just

4323.199 --> 4327.759999999999
i mean look or there are other reasons

4326.239 --> 4330.4
why you might

4327.76 --> 4332.56
not like kent hovind right

4330.4 --> 4336.239
maybe you don't like the measuring

4332.56 --> 4336.2390000000005
accent for example

4338.4 --> 4344.4
maybe you don't like that that could be

4340.56 --> 4346.8
something i don't know

4344.4 --> 4349.599999999999
maybe you think he's like

4346.8 --> 4353.4400000000005
he has like bad priest traits or

4349.6 --> 4356.400000000001
something which i mean he's not perfect

4353.44 --> 4358.159
he has some weird vibes sometimes that

4356.4 --> 4361.04
shine through that i pick up on it's

4358.159 --> 4363.679
just that he is in control of it

4361.04 --> 4363.679
it seems

4366.32 --> 4370.48
i mean that man has been through some

4368.4 --> 4373.36
[ __ ] in his life

4370.48 --> 4375.759999999999
don't forget that like he's been like

4373.36 --> 4375.759999999999
pretty

4377.28 --> 4383.4
haunted by the system in ways for what

4380.159 --> 4383.4
he's doing

4386.8 --> 4391.360000000001
what

4388.64 --> 4395.719
the roof is inhabits

4391.36 --> 4395.719
what are you talking about

4400.56 --> 4405.76
does ken david know there's yeah he does

4403.04 --> 4405.76
know about it

4410.8 --> 4414.88
he knows it's out there and he there's

4412.96 --> 4418.32
flatter like i

4414.88 --> 4420.4800000000005
even sometimes drop by his live streams

4418.32 --> 4422.88
and say things about flat earth i'm just

4420.48 --> 4427.839999999999
not gonna be a savage there because it's

4422.88 --> 4427.84
just annoying when people do that

4429.92 --> 4437.04
he must be stupid that no

4431.92 --> 4437.04
he's of the measuring culture

4438.719 --> 4442.64
okay yeah you could call that stupid

4440.719 --> 4443.84
fine you want to call him stupid he's

4442.64 --> 4446.400000000001
stupid

4443.84 --> 4451.400000000001
he's not an intellectual genius and he

4446.4 --> 4451.4
even says that about himself so

4458.56 --> 4461.92
if he knows

4461.04 --> 4464.4
no

4461.92 --> 4467.04
what he knows that was just he knows

4464.4 --> 4469.5199999999995
that there is a flat earth debate versus

4467.04 --> 4471.44
globe going on that it's still raging

4469.52 --> 4474.080000000001
and that it's controversial

4471.44 --> 4476.48
he just thinks it's a globe and he

4474.08 --> 4478.32
doesn't dig too deep

4476.48 --> 4479.599999999999
in order to come to the conclusion that

4478.32 --> 4483.239
it isn't

4479.6 --> 4483.2390000000005
that's what he's doing

4495.84 --> 4501.84
yeah maybe he thinks he is a globe

4498.159 --> 4501.839999999999
defender i don't know man

4502.48 --> 4508.08
i just kind of like it when he talks

4504.4 --> 4510.639999999999
about evolution and [ __ ] that's awesome

4508.08 --> 4513.76
like i don't want to like oh keep poking

4510.64 --> 4514.72
him until he becomes a flat earther like

4513.76 --> 4517.749
dudes

4514.72 --> 4517.749000000001
[Music]

4518.719 --> 4524.64
like not everybody in the freaking world

4521.679 --> 4529.159
has to become a flat earther

4524.64 --> 4529.159000000001
why can't you just leave it alone

4548.48 --> 4553.5199999999995
yeah that's right anti-flat earthers

4550.239 --> 4557.36
hate kenthoven that's right

4553.52 --> 4559.76
because he they don't like

4557.36 --> 4562.799999999999
creation they don't like god and he's

4559.76 --> 4565.4400000000005
like oh come on then he's like dude he

4562.8 --> 4567.679
references sai mandan and [ __ ]

4565.44 --> 4569.919999999999
on his live streams

4567.679 --> 4570.96
and he goes up against debates about

4569.92 --> 4573.4400000000005
that

4570.96 --> 4576.88
and he's crushing it every time he knows

4573.44 --> 4579.04
what he's doing when it comes to that

4576.88 --> 4581.76
so

4579.04 --> 4584.0
yeah i think you just got to take the

4581.76 --> 4588.52
globe

4584.0 --> 4588.52
with the creation in this case

4600.239 --> 4605.839999999999
that's like saying not everybody needs

4602.88 --> 4605.84
to know the truth

4606.4 --> 4609.44
well

4607.36 --> 4610.719
that depends on what you mean when you

4609.44 --> 4613.678999999999
say that

4610.719 --> 4615.92
so technically no not everybody needs to

4613.679 --> 4617.76
know the truth it's actually kind of

4615.92 --> 4621.84
unviable

4617.76 --> 4621.84
for people to do that

4622.0 --> 4626.08
like the spirit mechanics don't work

4624.4 --> 4630.32
that way

4626.08 --> 4633.04
people don't want to know it all you see

4630.32 --> 4635.679
they pick their battles they pick what

4633.04 --> 4637.76
they want to be enlightened about and

4635.679 --> 4640.56
what not

4637.76 --> 4643.280000000001
and you can't change that

4640.56 --> 4643.280000000001
for them

4645.28 --> 4647.5199999999995
right

4647.679 --> 4652.0
does it mean that if you got something

4649.6 --> 4654.320000000001
wrong and you roll it out in between

4652.0 --> 4655.84
what you talk about that are truthful

4654.32 --> 4659.5199999999995
things it doesn't mean that everybody is

4655.84 --> 4661.84
then going to just copy the wrong part

4659.52 --> 4663.84
automatically

4661.84 --> 4665.1990000000005
you can filter that out if you're aware

4663.84 --> 4668.08
about it

4665.199 --> 4670.96
and you might roll down the same path

4668.08 --> 4673.199
and then like bump into it as a mistake

4670.96 --> 4675.04
and then realize like wait he was always

4673.199 --> 4678.96
believing that but that part's actually

4675.04 --> 4682.08
wrong right it's not a problem

4678.96 --> 4685.52
you gotta trust that if people actually

4682.08 --> 4688.48
want to figure it out that they will

4685.52 --> 4690.8
they will start to ask questions

4688.48 --> 4692.5599999999995
step away from those that don't give

4690.8 --> 4694.88
good answers

4692.56 --> 4697.280000000001
and then figure it out and then maybe

4694.88 --> 4701.92
return

4697.28 --> 4705.5199999999995
right i mean i still watch alex jones

4701.92 --> 4709.04
i've done like for almost proof

4705.52 --> 4712.2390000000005
like 15 years or something

4709.04 --> 4714.0
on a daily basis and he is like

4712.239 --> 4715.28
he

4714.0 --> 4719.8
is

4715.28 --> 4719.8
pretty much an anti-flat earther

4720.64 --> 4725.1990000000005
but it's difficult i don't know if he's

4722.48 --> 4727.5199999999995
like just an extremist glober or an

4725.199 --> 4729.919999999999
anti-flat earther i don't know for sure

4727.52 --> 4732.96
i don't even really want to find out

4729.92 --> 4736.56
i can filter through that [ __ ] because i

4732.96 --> 4738.4
get how he does it what he does

4736.56 --> 4739.679
i'm okay with that yeah it's a little

4738.4 --> 4742.239
like ugh

4739.679 --> 4743.84
ooh going to the stores oh yeah alex

4742.239 --> 4745.04
yeah yeah yeah blah blah blah blah blah

4743.84 --> 4746.96
blah

4745.04 --> 4751.44
and then i just forget about it just

4746.96 --> 4754.88
move on i don't care it doesn't matter

4751.44 --> 4754.879999999999
it doesn't matter

4755.679 --> 4761.04
if you really want to know what's true

4758.0 --> 4762.96
then you're gonna figure it out

4761.04 --> 4765.199
and you're gonna bump into how the

4762.96 --> 4767.679
entire world is filled

4765.199 --> 4768.799999999999
with people that literally believe

4767.679 --> 4772.0
things

4768.8 --> 4773.28
that they don't understand

4772.0 --> 4776.239
and that

4773.28 --> 4778.32
technically the vast majority of what

4776.239 --> 4782.959999999999
people say without even realizing it

4778.32 --> 4782.96
about themselves and each other is wrong

4783.28 --> 4788.0
there's nothing you could do about it

4786.32 --> 4790.799999999999
you can't

4788.0 --> 4793.76
change that around

4790.8 --> 4796.0
people will always pick their battles in

4793.76 --> 4797.92
what they choose to understand and what

4796.0 --> 4803.08
they choose to be deluded about and

4797.92 --> 4803.08
there's nothing you can do about it

4808.88 --> 4812.159000000001
hello gary wubanga

4813.679 --> 4817.4800000000005
light before the tunnel

4826.4 --> 4829.4
hello

giant bread dick

4858.84 --> 4862.159000000001

4864.88 --> 4867.4400000000005

4894.719 --> 4896.96
all

4895.92 --> 4900.08

5079.199 --> 5082.799999999999
or native americans though i don't know

5081.04 --> 5085.199
what you're talking about exactly but in

5082.8 --> 5086.400000000001
general

5085.199 --> 5088.4
yeah

5086.4 --> 5090.159
if you try to force your belief onto

5088.4 --> 5092.239
somebody

5090.159 --> 5094.4
don't let them

5092.239 --> 5096.08
seek you out and

5094.4 --> 5098.5599999999995
ask you for it

5096.08 --> 5101.6
if you force it then they might just

5098.56 --> 5103.4400000000005
develop allergies

5101.6 --> 5105.360000000001
right it's kind of what happened to me

5103.44 --> 5108.0
in my youth

5105.36 --> 5111.36
like yeah i'm with god dude i'm with god

5108.0 --> 5113.04
god god is awesome and jesus sounds like

5111.36 --> 5115.679
pretty impressive i don't know much

5113.04 --> 5117.6
about him and then like christians being

5115.679 --> 5120.32
like

5117.6 --> 5122.88
you should not say that you should do

5120.32 --> 5125.44
this oh you don't go to the church so

5122.88 --> 5128.400000000001
you're evil we don't trust you we're not

5125.44 --> 5130.48
gonna we're not gonna look mean

5128.4 --> 5132.879999999999
at you

5130.48 --> 5134.959999999999
type of [ __ ]

5132.88 --> 5137.28
and then like squirt among one another

5134.96 --> 5140.96
about how they are the ones with god and

5137.28 --> 5143.92
i was like dude i'm so sick of this

5140.96 --> 5147.28
like this is so wrong

5143.92 --> 5148.88
i'm gonna be the exact opposite of that

5147.28 --> 5151.599999999999
and that's how i

5148.88 --> 5154.56
yeah i thought like oh yeah man i

5151.6 --> 5156.639
i'm with i'm a satanist now

5154.56 --> 5158.56
because they're the opposite of these

5156.639 --> 5161.6
[ __ ] up people

5158.56 --> 5164.159000000001
right it's what happens

5161.6 --> 5165.280000000001
that's what happens when you push your

5164.159 --> 5167.28
[ __ ]

5165.28 --> 5169.84
onto others

5167.28 --> 5172.48
try to force them into some kind of mind

5169.84 --> 5174.719
control bondage it's pathetic

5172.48 --> 5180.919999999999
it's archaic

5174.719 --> 5180.92
and it's not nice it's not a good thing

5182.4 --> 5186.239
it's the

5183.6 --> 5188.320000000001
in my opinion

5186.239 --> 5191.599999999999
what i associate with the catholic

5188.32 --> 5194.0
invention is just weaponizing it

5191.6 --> 5196.2390000000005
and then force it on people and in

5194.0 --> 5198.08
medieval times if there was such a thing

5196.239 --> 5199.04
they would even

5198.08 --> 5200.8
like

5199.04 --> 5203.5199999999995
kill people over it if they didn't

5200.8 --> 5205.92
conform that's just [ __ ] up

5203.52 --> 5208.4800000000005
like that's everything

5205.92 --> 5210.08
not christian everything about that is

5208.48 --> 5212.718999999999
wrong

5210.08 --> 5214.8
everything about it

5212.719 --> 5216.32
and that's why i thought like oh i'm

5214.8 --> 5219.1990000000005
going to be a satanist then because i'm

5216.32 --> 5222.5599999999995
the opposite of that well guess what

5219.199 --> 5226.638999999999
they kind of already were the satanist

5222.56 --> 5226.639
they just didn't really realize it

5226.719 --> 5230.2390000000005
they were

5227.92 --> 5233.12
deeply fooled

5230.239 --> 5234.718999999999
deeply embedded in a

5233.12 --> 5237.44
mechanism

5234.719 --> 5239.12
that encapsulates

5237.44 --> 5242.799999999999
jesus christ

5239.12 --> 5246.5599999999995
and then distracts you away from it

5242.8 --> 5248.96
you don't actually get to see it anymore

5246.56 --> 5251.1990000000005
you think you're on its side

5248.96 --> 5253.12
that's what they did

5251.199 --> 5255.839999999999
it's how i kind of fell into the

5253.12 --> 5258.0
opposition trap and then i found myself

5255.84 --> 5259.84
surrounded by actual [ __ ] up

5258.0 --> 5261.76
psychopaths that really wanted to

5259.84 --> 5263.52
destroy the world i wouldn't even feel

5261.76 --> 5264.719
anything about it

5263.52 --> 5267.6
yeah

5264.719 --> 5270.96
really [ __ ] up people that are also on

5267.6 --> 5274.08
the satanist side and that abuse people

5270.96 --> 5276.639
like me that are just rebellious

5274.08 --> 5278.44
for their psychotic

5276.639 --> 5282.08
wealth destroying

5278.44 --> 5282.08
self-aggrandizing schemes

5282.239 --> 5286.4
they tried that [ __ ] on me

5284.32 --> 5287.679
didn't really work

5286.4 --> 5292.4
that's why i

5287.679 --> 5295.28
basically did the same thing with that

5292.4 --> 5298.5599999999995
first i was like oh i'm a certainist

5295.28 --> 5302.719
because i'm like auntie that christian

5298.56 --> 5304.719
then i became an anti-satanist satanist

5302.719 --> 5306.88
like yeah i'm a satanist but i'm anti

5304.719 --> 5309.52
the rest of you because you're exactly

5306.88 --> 5312.4800000000005
wrong about everything

5309.52 --> 5316.719
and then things got kind of weird

5312.48 --> 5316.718999999999
and isolated not expectedly

5319.04 --> 5324.719
i'm just like yeah i'm just oppositional

5321.84 --> 5324.719
defiant now

5325.36 --> 5329.599999999999
uh

5327.04 --> 5333.84
religion itself means bondage yeah

5329.6 --> 5336.56
now that's been my eventual conclusion

5333.84 --> 5339.1990000000005
like the real jesus christ taught

5336.56 --> 5340.8
about the individual

5339.199 --> 5344.5599999999995
individual

5340.8 --> 5347.679
the church right here that's the church

5344.56 --> 5348.719
this is the church you you are the

5347.679 --> 5349.76
church

5348.719 --> 5352.2390000000005
and not

5349.76 --> 5357.1990000000005
the only one you're it's not like oh

5352.239 --> 5357.199
we're living in a world of popes or no

5357.36 --> 5365.44
not you over others you over you

5362.639 --> 5367.92
you're your own church not to rule over

5365.44 --> 5369.28
others but to rule over you

5367.92 --> 5372.08
and that

5369.28 --> 5375.44
was the true foundation that's been lost

5372.08 --> 5378.5599999999995
like in all sides that's being lost

5375.44 --> 5381.199
because the evil devils sneak in it they

5378.56 --> 5384.159000000001
sneak in there and the power structures

5381.199 --> 5388.638999999999
and then they distract away from that so

5384.159 --> 5390.879999999999
that they can use you as their puppet

5388.639 --> 5393.4400000000005
and that's on all sides

5390.88 --> 5395.12
all religions all sides satanism

5393.44 --> 5399.04
christianity

5395.12 --> 5399.04
all devil puppets

5399.84 --> 5405.04
distract you away from the core

5402.719 --> 5408.4800000000005
jesus christ's teachings and then play

5405.04 --> 5410.639
you off against one another like little

5408.48 --> 5412.4
dumbass puppets

5410.639 --> 5414.2390000000005
and you'll love it and you'll think

5412.4 --> 5416.4
you're on the right side and you're the

5414.239 --> 5418.239
one that's the good man and they're the

5416.4 --> 5419.44
bad man

5418.239 --> 5420.879999999999
until

5419.44 --> 5424.239
you die

5420.88 --> 5424.2390000000005
and nothing is accomplished

5426.48 --> 5430.36
i'm gonna get my bread

5480.88 --> 5485.28
it's just now

5483.04 --> 5487.36
in this age

5485.28 --> 5489.44
every time

5487.36 --> 5491.5199999999995
i think about some guy

5489.44 --> 5493.919999999999
kind of like me

5491.52 --> 5498.2390000000005
that's like oh [ __ ] christianity i'm

5493.92 --> 5501.1990000000005
gonna be satan i'm gonna be like bad ass

5498.239 --> 5501.199
i'm thinking like

5502.84 --> 5508.88
man the pope

5505.76 --> 5511.280000000001
the real [ __ ] up leaders in these mega

5508.88 --> 5515.04
corporation

5511.28 --> 5517.04
corporations covering for churches

5515.04 --> 5518.48
every time somebody turns into a

5517.04 --> 5521.76
satanist

5518.48 --> 5524.799999999999
because of how [ __ ] up

5521.76 --> 5526.400000000001
christianity has become they laugh

5524.8 --> 5530.04
because that

5526.4 --> 5530.04
was the point

5533.52 --> 5539.52
they're they're like that on purpose

5536.639 --> 5541.04
so that you naturally

5539.52 --> 5545.040000000001
choose

5541.04 --> 5549.28
to oppose them and become a satanist

5545.04 --> 5549.28
they are actually satanists

5549.36 --> 5554.88
and they pose with pure

5552.04 --> 5559.12
unadulterated purified

5554.88 --> 5562.400000000001
hypocrisy so that you choose to become a

5559.12 --> 5564.08
satanist in response to that that

5562.4 --> 5566.96
was the

5564.08 --> 5569.12
point of it all

5566.96 --> 5570.08
and i fell right into that trap at the

5569.12 --> 5573.599999999999
start

5570.08 --> 5576.159
but then i realized that

5573.6 --> 5580.1990000000005
eventually and it didn't go too far in

5576.159 --> 5580.199
between i hope

5593.52 --> 5596.52
hmm

5614.56 --> 5622.1990000000005
yeah tara 306 dude the pope is so

5617.44 --> 5622.199
[ __ ] the antichrist it's unbelievable

5622.239 --> 5625.839999999999
i mean

5623.44 --> 5629.04
last time i heard anything about him

5625.84 --> 5631.360000000001
he was taking down crosses in some

5629.04 --> 5634.08
ceremony because he thought it would

5631.36 --> 5634.08
offend

5634.56 --> 5638.2390000000005
migrants

5637.12 --> 5642.84
like

5638.239 --> 5646.959999999999
the pope comes in and says take down the

5642.84 --> 5648.159000000001
crosses. because we might offend

5646.96 --> 5652.159
migrants

5648.159 --> 5653.839999999999
the [ __ ] hell dude

5652.159 --> 5656.239
like

5653.84 --> 5658.88
i don't get it why hasn't somebody

5656.239 --> 5661.759999999999
pushed this fat [ __ ] fetal piece of

5658.88 --> 5665.4800000000005
[ __ ] off a building yet

5661.76 --> 5665.4800000000005
i don't get it

5677.84 --> 5682.4800000000005
just i don't know man make it look like

5680.0 --> 5686.76
an accident or something but this is

5682.48 --> 5686.759999999999
just so [ __ ] up

5689.44 --> 5692.57
[Music]

5693.36 --> 5696.36
so

5701.28 --> 5703.92
yeah clutch

5705.04 --> 5709.36
i love our own benjamin is so aware of

5707.199 --> 5709.36
that

5713.199 --> 5716.5599999999995
right does thou wilt

5715.28 --> 5719.119
because

5716.56 --> 5721.76
jesus forgives everything

5719.119 --> 5724.239
doesn't matter what you do how [ __ ] up

5721.76 --> 5726.159000000001
doubling down on your sins aggravating

5724.239 --> 5728.5599999999995
your sins getting worse and worse and

5726.159 --> 5731.119
loving it it's okay because jesus

5728.56 --> 5732.0
forgives everything only thing you have

5731.119 --> 5733.5199999999995
to do

5732.0 --> 5736.8
is chant

5733.52 --> 5739.92
that you believe him and all is forgiven

5736.8 --> 5742.56
no matter how [ __ ] maniacal

5739.92 --> 5745.1990000000005
no matter if it is just beyond barbaric

5742.56 --> 5747.119000000001
what you like to do and promise to get

5745.199 --> 5749.678999999999
worse at it

5747.119 --> 5751.92
it's okay because jesus forgives you

5749.679 --> 5754.88
because you chanted some stupid ass

5751.92 --> 5757.679
chant that jesus himself didn't even say

5754.88 --> 5760.719
but some priest tells you to say that

5757.679 --> 5762.4800000000005
yeah it's okay you can be whatever

5760.719 --> 5765.119
freaking maniacal

5762.48 --> 5767.36
monster you like because if you say the

5765.119 --> 5768.719
chant and jesus will forgive you and

5767.36 --> 5771.719
it's okay

5768.719 --> 5771.719
yeah

5789.119 --> 5791.36
um

5793.679 --> 5797.4800000000005
so you can start what

5801.84 --> 5806.08
who are you specifically times i was

5803.92 --> 5808.4800000000005
talking about the pope

5806.08 --> 5811.48
and wondering why that hasn't happened

5808.48 --> 5811.48
already

5812.159 --> 5815.92
with how he's been acting it's like

5818.4 --> 5824.239
like every pretense about the entire

5821.44 --> 5827.44
catholic society at this point

5824.239 --> 5830.638999999999
they must all realize now that hey

5827.44 --> 5833.119
we are the church of satan

5830.639 --> 5835.04
yeah the catholic church is now the

5833.119 --> 5837.199
church of satan look at what the pope is

5835.04 --> 5840.639
doing he's taking down crosses he's

5837.199 --> 5843.5199999999995
opposing everything christ saying

5840.639 --> 5843.52
like at some point

5844.32 --> 5849.199
it's gonna lose every last piece of

5847.52 --> 5851.119000000001
spirit that was still good it's gonna be

5849.199 --> 5853.04
lost

5851.119 --> 5855.44
at some point

5853.04 --> 5857.92
if there is no brutal action if there's

5855.44 --> 5861.36
no like okay pope

5857.92 --> 5861.36
you have gone insane

5862.4 --> 5867.759999999999
we are now going to dethrone you oh it's

5865.36 --> 5870.4
never done before yeah but we are you're

5867.76 --> 5872.2390000000005
you are stepping down right now

5870.4 --> 5875.44
or you will

5872.239 --> 5878.159
suddenly get an accident somehow

5875.44 --> 5880.599999999999
because this has to stop the entire

5878.159 --> 5884.5599999999995
institute is going to be

5880.6 --> 5886.2390000000005
absolutely obliterated

5884.56 --> 5889.88
if you don't get

5886.239 --> 5889.879999999999
out of that position

5898.56 --> 5901.56
so

5909.06 --> 5912.259
[Music]

5913.92 --> 5917.04
right pga cnet

5920.32 --> 5924.199
you would be doing that

5924.48 --> 5927.199
but

5925.199 --> 5930.0
i don't know he's already taking down

5927.199 --> 5930.0
crosses right

5930.4 --> 5935.36
putting it upside down is like

5933.04 --> 5938.239
right but he's actually like ordering

5935.36 --> 5940.639
people like get those crosses out of

5938.239 --> 5940.638999999999
here

5942.08 --> 5946.719
is he's the he's the religious leader

5945.04 --> 5949.6
of christianity

5946.719 --> 5952.719
telling people take away those crosses

5949.6 --> 5956.0
it may offend people like that's yours

5952.719 --> 5958.719
religious supreme leader

5956.0 --> 5960.0
that's the representative of god

5958.719 --> 5962.56
telling you

5960.0 --> 5966.639
to take her down the crosses because it

5962.56 --> 5969.679
might offend somebody yes yes

5966.639 --> 5972.92
that's your representative of god

5969.679 --> 5972.92
of course

5985.28 --> 5988.4
i mean

5986.8 --> 5992.0
it would be

5988.4 --> 5992.0
only a logical next step

5992.08 --> 5996.8
if the pope

5994.8 --> 6000.0
would order people to

5996.8 --> 6000.0
erect a cross

6000.08 --> 6007.28
and then douse it in gasoline

6003.679 --> 6012.08
and light it on fire why

6007.28 --> 6012.08
because the cross is racist

6015.679 --> 6023.0
you know he would do it if he could

6019.04 --> 6023.0
you know we do it

6024.32 --> 6029.44
telling people to erect crosses

6027.28 --> 6030.5599999999995
and then burn them

6029.44 --> 6031.759999999999
why

6030.56 --> 6035.04
because

6031.76 --> 6035.04
crosses are racist

6035.199 --> 6042.759999999999
you know we do it

6038.159 --> 6042.759999999999
you know he'd do it if he could

6054.56 --> 6061.400000000001
can you imagine that people might

6056.56 --> 6061.400000000001
actually do it if he told them

6078.639 --> 6082.2390000000005
why is a cross racist

6082.38 --> 6085.459
[Music]

6089.04 --> 6093.6
hello

6090.96 --> 6097.36
somebody seems to be just not really up

6093.6 --> 6097.360000000001
to par with high level thinking

6103.119 --> 6108.159
i mean why do you think

6105.76 --> 6111.6
like what did i just say

6108.159 --> 6111.599999999999
and with the reasons

6118.96 --> 6126.8
you just got here okay so my point was

6122.8 --> 6129.119000000001
the pope is pretty much the devil

6126.8 --> 6131.679
at this point

6129.119 --> 6134.32
he is an antichrist

6131.679 --> 6137.1990000000005
he orders people to take down crosses

6134.32 --> 6139.84
because it might offend somebody during

6137.199 --> 6143.04
rituals

6139.84 --> 6145.76
it's insane so i was thinking okay so

6143.04 --> 6146.96
why not then order people to erect a

6145.76 --> 6149.6
cross

6146.96 --> 6151.679
and then light it on fire

6149.6 --> 6154.96
and then just give the reason

6151.679 --> 6156.639
because crosses are racist

6154.96 --> 6159.52
yeah just

6156.639 --> 6162.56
it doesn't have to make sense

6159.52 --> 6164.88
when it comes from his mouth there's a

6162.56 --> 6167.4400000000005
vague association that it might be

6164.88 --> 6169.1990000000005
associated with racism people will out

6167.44 --> 6170.96
there buy it

6169.199 --> 6172.719
and the beautiful well it's not

6170.96 --> 6174.719
beautiful it's actually quite disgusting

6172.719 --> 6176.4800000000005
it's just that i get so pissed off i

6174.719 --> 6177.6
find it beautiful again which is not

6176.48 --> 6179.5199999999995
healthy

6177.6 --> 6183.119000000001
the beautiful thing about it is that of

6179.52 --> 6184.88
course a burning cross

6183.119 --> 6186.48
oh yeah

6184.88 --> 6188.8
where did that happen

6186.48 --> 6188.799999999999
yeah

6188.84 --> 6194.639
exactly so he would then tell people

6192.239 --> 6196.959999999999
burn the cross because the cross's race

6194.639 --> 6200.159000000001
is not realizing that actually burning a

6196.96 --> 6202.56
cross is traditionally a racist thing in

6200.159 --> 6202.5599999999995
certain

6202.719 --> 6209.04
periods in history huh huh yeah that was

6206.4 --> 6211.119
the joke it's not even funny but that's

6209.04 --> 6212.48
why i'm saying like yeah he could do

6211.119 --> 6215.679
that

6212.48 --> 6215.678999999999
that could be a next thing

6216.8 --> 6221.84
right

6219.28 --> 6224.5599999999995
basically i mean what would be better

6221.84 --> 6227.360000000001
for the devil

6224.56 --> 6229.280000000001
than to tell you to do something

6227.36 --> 6232.32
because of a reason

6229.28 --> 6235.44
that you in your mind want to prevent

6232.32 --> 6237.36
when doing that thing is exactly what

6235.44 --> 6239.759999999999
that thing you think you're preventing

6237.36 --> 6243.119
actually is

6239.76 --> 6245.360000000001
that's the ultimate satan grip of power

6243.119 --> 6247.44
over your mind that's why they would

6245.36 --> 6250.159
love that [ __ ]

6247.44 --> 6252.879999999999
yeah pope telling people

6250.159 --> 6255.28
erect crosses and then burn them why

6252.88 --> 6257.92
because the crosses are racist and then

6255.28 --> 6260.239
people might just do it not realizing

6257.92 --> 6263.6
that burning across was actually a thing

6260.239 --> 6265.119
that people used to do

6263.6 --> 6266.719
to intimidate

6265.119 --> 6267.679
races

6266.719 --> 6270.08
huh

6267.679 --> 6273.8
yeah that was my point

6270.08 --> 6273.8
i hope you got it

6295.84 --> 6298.84
hmm

6314.719 --> 6319.119
right so did everybody get that

6327.04 --> 6331.84
are you already too distracted by your

6328.96 --> 6331.84
own conversations

6349.679 --> 6352.2390000000005
all right good

6353.119 --> 6358.08
and you you guys agree that the pope

6356.0 --> 6359.119
might just do something like that

6358.08 --> 6361.36
because

6359.119 --> 6363.36
i mean if i were the devil that's

6361.36 --> 6366.159
exactly what i do

6363.36 --> 6368.08
right what what is more

6366.159 --> 6370.4
nectar of satan

6368.08 --> 6372.639
than to literally tell people to do

6370.4 --> 6374.879999999999
something because of a reason that they

6372.639 --> 6377.1990000000005
want to avoid

6374.88 --> 6380.32
when the thing that he tells them to do

6377.199 --> 6383.04
exactly is that thing

6380.32 --> 6386.32
that they're actually trying to avoid

6383.04 --> 6389.84
what is more satanic than that it's like

6386.32 --> 6389.84
nectar of satan himself

6399.28 --> 6403.599999999999
death threats what the [ __ ] are you

6400.96 --> 6405.679
talking about sean

6403.6 --> 6408.2390000000005
i'm not making death threats to anybody

6405.679 --> 6409.84
i've never made death threats to anyone

6408.239 --> 6411.919999999999
i've expressed

6409.84 --> 6413.52
certain

6411.92 --> 6414.639
feelings

6413.52 --> 6417.119000000001
about

6414.639 --> 6417.119
people

6417.6 --> 6422.400000000001
and i've asked questions like hey why

6420.159 --> 6423.28
didn't somebody throw him off a building

6422.4 --> 6424.239
yet

6423.28 --> 6428.119
right

6424.239 --> 6428.119
that's not a death threat

6432.0 --> 6437.6
it's a question

6434.4 --> 6439.839999999999
i just made a thread

6437.6 --> 6441.280000000001
i think you're not i think you have to

6439.84 --> 6443.52
like first

6441.28 --> 6445.5199999999995
make sure that your thinking actually

6443.52 --> 6447.92
works sean hawkins before you try to

6445.52 --> 6451.52
assault somebody

6447.92 --> 6454.4
with your stupid suggestions

6451.52 --> 6456.88
let's call it a threat no it's not

6454.4 --> 6459.199
i mean i don't understand why somebody

6456.88 --> 6461.04
hasn't thrown you off a building yet

6459.199 --> 6463.36
sean hawkins

6461.04 --> 6464.56
i don't understand why i mean why

6463.36 --> 6465.759999999999
wouldn't you

6464.56 --> 6468.159000000001
right

6465.76 --> 6470.4800000000005
that's not a death threat yeah

6468.159 --> 6472.638999999999
you can try to do whatever the [ __ ] you

6470.48 --> 6475.28
want with that you can record it you can

6472.639 --> 6476.32
send it to a lawyer you can report my

6475.28 --> 6480.96
video

6476.32 --> 6485.5599999999995
it's not gonna help because it isn't a

6480.96 --> 6485.56
death threat you [ __ ] [ __ ]

6493.6 --> 6498.96
oh come and try oh so now you actually

6496.0 --> 6502.0
want me to physically do something

6498.96 --> 6504.56
oh yeah yeah thank you for quickly

6502.0 --> 6506.639
moving on and thereby admitting that

6504.56 --> 6509.1990000000005
you're wrong

6506.639 --> 6512.679
and that it wasn't a death threat you

6509.199 --> 6512.678999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

6515.43 --> 6518.509
[Music]

6521.81 --> 6526.439
[Music]

6530.29 --> 6533.38
[Music]

6534.239 --> 6540.718999999999
i want you to try so i can put you down

6538.96 --> 6542.88
wow

6540.719 --> 6545.199
well by your standards

6542.88 --> 6546.8
that's actually a death threat sean

6545.199 --> 6550.0
hawkins

6546.8 --> 6552.2390000000005
why are you death threatening me

6550.0 --> 6555.84
by your own standards which you

6552.239 --> 6555.839999999999
complained about first

6556.159 --> 6562.08
are you just being a gamma [ __ ]

6559.84 --> 6564.8
and you just little squirty because your

6562.08 --> 6564.8
dick hurts

6566.96 --> 6570.4
because you whacked off too much

6570.639 --> 6572.96
huh

6573.28 --> 6576.759999999999
little [ __ ]

6588.08 --> 6591.08
dude

6598.639 --> 6601.1990000000005
dude sean

6600.0 --> 6604.4
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6601.199 --> 6609.4
talking about if i want to have you dead

6604.4 --> 6609.4
i just send you some drugs

6610.159 --> 6613.36
don't have to do anything

6616.239 --> 6621.5199999999995
you'll do it all yourself

6619.04 --> 6624.159
because you're such a dumbass impulsive

6621.52 --> 6626.080000000001
idiot

6624.159 --> 6627.119
you can't even prevent

6626.08 --> 6629.04
like

6627.119 --> 6631.759999999999
doing that to yourself because you're

6629.04 --> 6633.119
just an impulsive [ __ ] that doesn't

6631.76 --> 6635.679
know what the [ __ ] they're doing in

6633.119 --> 6635.679
their lives

6636.96 --> 6640.56
right all i needed to do is just give

6639.599 --> 6644.2390000000005
you

6640.56 --> 6646.2390000000005
some stuff of a certain classification

6644.239 --> 6647.678999999999
and you're just gonna [ __ ] up and get

6646.239 --> 6651.239
yourself killed

6647.679 --> 6651.2390000000005
i know you would

6660.08 --> 6663.08
do

6673.679 --> 6677.679
this evolved from lizard brain to monkey

6676.08 --> 6680.719
right now

6677.679 --> 6682.32
now there's no more evolution

6680.719 --> 6683.679
for sean

6682.32 --> 6687.28
i mean there is such a thing as

6683.679 --> 6688.719
spiritual evolution right there's

6687.28 --> 6690.639
adaptation

6688.719 --> 6693.52
physical adaptation

6690.639 --> 6694.400000000001
spiritual evolution like the things that

6693.52 --> 6696.719
have been

6694.4 --> 6698.5599999999995
conjured up about how evolution

6696.719 --> 6701.679
supposedly work

6698.56 --> 6704.159000000001
is all derived from actual

6701.679 --> 6706.32
consciousness and spiritual development

6704.159 --> 6707.199
when there is an evolution there's even

6706.32 --> 6709.199
like

6707.199 --> 6710.159
the trial and error

6709.199 --> 6712.879999999999
right

6710.159 --> 6715.04
that's that's from the spirit so they

6712.88 --> 6717.599
basically took something that is real

6715.04 --> 6719.5199999999995
spiritual development then projected it

6717.599 --> 6721.52
onto the material

6719.52 --> 6724.56
right while at the same time

6721.52 --> 6726.2390000000005
ignoring and denying that spiritual

6724.56 --> 6728.96
things and the spirit and god and

6726.239 --> 6731.678999999999
everything about that even exists

6728.96 --> 6734.56
right so they stole something from the

6731.679 --> 6737.36
spiritual then projected it onto the

6734.56 --> 6738.8
material realm and said this is

6737.36 --> 6740.5599999999995
evolution

6738.8 --> 6742.719
that's how they did it

6740.56 --> 6745.4400000000005
but evolution does exist

6742.719 --> 6747.28
in the spirit in the consciousness

6745.44 --> 6749.759999999999
throughout our life

6747.28 --> 6751.5199999999995
that happens it has to happen

6749.76 --> 6753.360000000001
natural selection

6751.52 --> 6755.76
through trial and error

6753.36 --> 6759.5199999999995
all internal

6755.76 --> 6762.360000000001
spiritual evolution happens it's just

6759.52 --> 6765.52
in the physical substance itself the

6762.36 --> 6767.679
non-consciousness related material

6765.52 --> 6770.320000000001
doesn't evolve

6767.679 --> 6772.8
it adapts to the environment

6770.32 --> 6776.239
and has a limited spectrum

6772.8 --> 6779.04
within which it can adapt

6776.239 --> 6780.959999999999
and if it adapts in one direction it it

6779.04 --> 6782.56
doesn't keep on adapting in that

6780.96 --> 6784.4800000000005
direction there's a limit there's a

6782.56 --> 6788.56
point after which it can adapt no

6784.48 --> 6791.199
further and then if circumstances

6788.56 --> 6793.76
become more neutral then the adaptation

6791.199 --> 6797.919999999999
will slowly diminish

6793.76 --> 6801.96
going back to the more original state

6797.92 --> 6801.96
and that's how it really works

6809.84 --> 6813.92
what are the kinds of drugs or we talk

6811.44 --> 6816.159
about crack and meth

6813.92 --> 6817.84
sean you know your favorite

6816.159 --> 6821.4
that's stuff that you're not supposed to

6817.84 --> 6821.400000000001
be using anymore

6828.56 --> 6832.2390000000005
that's right light before the tone thank

6830.08 --> 6835.4
you thank you for appreciating that yeah

6832.239 --> 6835.4
they did

6835.52 --> 6840.96
they stole it from the spiritual realm

6838.4 --> 6844.799999999999
projected it onto the physical and then

6840.96 --> 6845.679
denied the spiritual realm even existed

6844.8 --> 6848.400000000001
right

6845.679 --> 6850.159
cold materialism they stole from the

6848.4 --> 6853.119
spiritual

6850.159 --> 6854.0
so the ones that created materialism

6853.119 --> 6856.48
knew

6854.0 --> 6858.719
there was a spiritual

6856.48 --> 6860.4
and they stole from it and then they

6858.719 --> 6861.44
lied about

6860.4 --> 6864.239
it

6861.44 --> 6864.239
about everything

6874.32 --> 6880.08
no sean hawkins i'm not gonna do your

6876.719 --> 6881.679
polaris challenge your coward

6880.08 --> 6883.199
i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna

6881.679 --> 6887.28
waste my time

6883.199 --> 6889.36
with the demented crackhead i'm sorry

6887.28 --> 6892.32
like

6889.36 --> 6894.48
like you can barely even have normal

6892.32 --> 6897.84
communication

6894.48 --> 6897.839999999999
let alone debating

6902.719 --> 6908.159
this

6905.52 --> 6908.159000000001
this

6911.04 --> 6914.96
ocean ocean

6915.119 --> 6921.04
shaun of the dead

6917.28 --> 6921.04
the undead walking

6923.36 --> 6928.4
yeah sean you really are like an undead

6925.84 --> 6930.400000000001
zombie to me

6928.4 --> 6932.48
probably not just me

6930.4 --> 6934.879999999999
i wonder if you even realize that people

6932.48 --> 6937.879999999999
do kind of see you as like an undead

6934.88 --> 6937.88
zombie

6949.76 --> 6956.08
do you think you do that yeah yeah it's

6952.639 --> 6957.84
not just me by the way

6956.08 --> 6960.159
right i'm not saying you're doing it

6957.84 --> 6963.52
right now although those are very tough

6960.159 --> 6963.5199999999995
habits to kick yeah

6963.599 --> 6968.719
but we're we're all kind of certain that

6966.48 --> 6971.36
at some point in your life you probably

6968.719 --> 6972.4800000000005
have done that

6971.36 --> 6975.598999999999
because

6972.48 --> 6976.718999999999
no person would just naturally become

6975.599 --> 6979.28
that

6976.719 --> 6981.84
numbed down and deranged and

6979.28 --> 6983.36
short-sighted all naturally

6981.84 --> 6985.679
right

6983.36 --> 6988.08
people that are like you

6985.679 --> 6990.679
usually have to go through severe drug

6988.08 --> 6993.44
abuse to become as demented and

6990.679 --> 6995.599
anti-social as you

6993.44 --> 6996.879999999999
people don't normally become like that

6995.599 --> 6999.1990000000005
without it

6996.88 --> 7002.679
that's why everybody thinks that about

6999.199 --> 7002.678999999999
you sean hawkins

7010.86 --> 7013.91
[Music]

7016.159 --> 7019.159
it's

7032.48 --> 7036.32
yeah i'm not a big fan of the morgow

7036.639 --> 7043.28
dude if you've really never taken

7040.88 --> 7045.84
any drugs i don't believe you first off

7043.28 --> 7046.88
i really don't i really don't believe

7045.84 --> 7049.119000000001
that

7046.88 --> 7051.4400000000005
and you're a [ __ ] liar

7049.119 --> 7052.88
in many fronts

7051.44 --> 7055.199
so basically

7052.88 --> 7058.719
taking your word on anything is kind of

7055.199 --> 7062.799999999999
a foolish act by itself

7058.719 --> 7065.36
but my god like if you're not actually a

7062.8 --> 7067.28
crack hat that made you this stupid

7065.36 --> 7069.28
then what the [ __ ] was your mother

7067.28 --> 7071.44
taking while you were pregnant or while

7069.28 --> 7073.84
you were in her belly like holy [ __ ]

7071.44 --> 7078.119
dude

7073.84 --> 7078.119000000001
like what was she on

7089.119 --> 7093.92
ah okay yeah rick back

7091.84 --> 7094.88
sorry

7093.92 --> 7097.28
dude

7094.88 --> 7100.0
you're a sensible person i've known

7097.28 --> 7102.239
people that have severe drug abuse i'm

7100.0 --> 7106.639
not trying to even shame drug abusers

7102.239 --> 7106.638999999999
it's just that sean hawkins here is

7107.36 --> 7110.719
i don't know

7108.48 --> 7112.08
it's hard not to think about that sort

7110.719 --> 7113.92
of thing

7112.08 --> 7116.32
when you face a guy like that i think

7113.92 --> 7117.36
that sean hawkins would probably be a

7116.32 --> 7121.36
very

7117.36 --> 7123.679
good promotional figure to show

7121.36 --> 7125.839999999999
in order for you to actually realize

7123.679 --> 7127.84
like maybe i should stop using drugs

7125.84 --> 7129.119000000001
because you might just end up like sean

7127.84 --> 7131.119000000001
hawkins

7129.119 --> 7133.119
so in that sense

7131.119 --> 7135.759999999999
john hawkins presence might be a good

7133.119 --> 7137.5199999999995
thing maybe he just came into existence

7135.76 --> 7138.719
just to show

7137.52 --> 7141.52
people

7138.719 --> 7142.4800000000005
on an intuitive level maybe it's time to

7141.52 --> 7143.76
quit

7142.48 --> 7146.4
because

7143.76 --> 7147.52
who knows maybe i could turn into sean

7146.4 --> 7149.04
hawkins

7147.52 --> 7151.679
right that would be a pretty good

7149.04 --> 7156.679
motivator to stop hard drugs

7151.679 --> 7156.679
even if he hasn't actually taken any

7163.36 --> 7168.598999999999
yeah by the way good on you rig back

7178.08 --> 7182.84
but i'm i'm right right you know i'm

7180.32 --> 7184.639
right i mean just sean

7182.84 --> 7185.84
hawkins

7184.639 --> 7188.8
like

7185.84 --> 7191.4400000000005
him on video saying something stupid or

7188.8 --> 7194.4800000000005
energetic like you could just take that

7191.44 --> 7195.598999999999
out and then just go to like

7194.48 --> 7197.4
clinics

7195.599 --> 7199.4400000000005
where a drug

7197.4 --> 7201.44
rehabilitation and it's like the first

7199.44 --> 7202.96
thing you show like you want to end up

7201.44 --> 7205.678999999999
like this guy

7202.96 --> 7208.2390000000005
then keep enjoying your drugs because

7205.679 --> 7210.719
dude that would freaking make me quit

7208.239 --> 7212.718999999999
forever

7210.719 --> 7215.36
if i actually was told like you could

7212.719 --> 7216.4
end up like him dude

7215.36 --> 7220.28
that's

7216.4 --> 7220.28
that's like terrified

7228.12 --> 7231.4
[Music]

7229.84 --> 7235.429
you did that 30 year

7231.4 --> 7235.429
[Laughter]

7238.48 --> 7243.119
so you did i knew it

7245.119 --> 7249.598999999999
oh [ __ ]

7247.36 --> 7249.598999999999
oh

7249.92 --> 7253.4800000000005
i knew it

7258.0 --> 7261.639
i knew it

7268.56 --> 7270.8
oh

7273.04 --> 7277.4
oh man thank you for that

7287.85 --> 7293.0
[Music]

7290.0 --> 7293.0
um

7301.28 --> 7304.08
wow sean

7304.88 --> 7309.36
i mean

7306.639 --> 7313.119
i think you might be stuck into like a a

7309.36 --> 7314.88
projecting feedback loop right here

7313.119 --> 7315.839999999999
going all caps

7314.88 --> 7320.08
i mean

7315.84 --> 7323.04
do i sound or look like i'm squirting

7320.08 --> 7323.04
am i in pain

7323.36 --> 7327.5199999999995
i think you're actually in pain

7328.8 --> 7332.56
you just seem to be unwilling to

7331.599 --> 7335.1990000000005
to

7332.56 --> 7337.119000000001
admit that to yourself so you're kind of

7335.199 --> 7339.28
projecting it like i'm doing that it's

7337.119 --> 7343.598999999999
not really working though you know it

7339.28 --> 7346.719
never really works to try and make fun

7343.599 --> 7348.0
of somebody that is in your state that

7346.719 --> 7349.76
you think is

7348.0 --> 7351.119
yeah that you're projecting it never

7349.76 --> 7353.1990000000005
really works

7351.119 --> 7354.719
it just kind of makes you look really

7353.199 --> 7357.36
pathetic

7354.719 --> 7358.56
because it's pretty obvious to everybody

7357.36 --> 7360.4
looking

7358.56 --> 7363.119000000001
and reading here

7360.4 --> 7364.879999999999
that you are projecting except maybe you

7363.119 --> 7366.96
like you might be the only one you're

7364.88 --> 7370.08
fooling right now right i call it

7366.96 --> 7373.36
gaslighting oneself

7370.08 --> 7374.32
and anti-flat earthers are increasingly

7373.36 --> 7376.08
apt

7374.32 --> 7378.159
at it

7376.08 --> 7380.159
with you as one of the prime examples i

7378.159 --> 7382.159
think you're actually so good at

7380.159 --> 7383.679
projecting your own predicament onto

7382.159 --> 7385.199
whoever you're

7383.679 --> 7387.04
going at

7385.199 --> 7390.4
that you don't even realize what you're

7387.04 --> 7390.4
doing anymore consciously

7391.28 --> 7394.639
yeah

7392.239 --> 7396.879999999999
i mean he might literally be whacking

7394.639 --> 7399.92
off in front of his screen right now as

7396.88 --> 7402.0
he tells me to squirt for him

7399.92 --> 7404.2390000000005
which is like really gross by the way

7402.0 --> 7409.0
sorry for that imagery

7404.239 --> 7409.0
but yeah that could be real

7443.52 --> 7447.159000000001
yeah gross

7450.56 --> 7455.59
i returned and yeah dude you're in the

7453.52 --> 7457.1990000000005
spam filter sean

7455.59 --> 7459.04
[Music]

7457.199 --> 7460.96
you never say anything you're just

7459.04 --> 7462.88
whining and complaining like you would

7460.96 --> 7466.639
in comments

7462.88 --> 7466.639
like why would i respond to that

7467.599 --> 7473.599
hey kenny i was the bread was awesome

7471.28 --> 7475.599
i still have the other half of it

7473.599 --> 7478.400000000001
but that was like great

7475.599 --> 7480.88
for freaking 99 cents i can't make

7478.4 --> 7483.44
something like that for 99 cents

7480.88 --> 7483.4400000000005
organic

7484.48 --> 7488.04
but yeah it was great

7499.599 --> 7507.599
charles uh dude skeptic 936 that's so

7503.679 --> 7510.0
mean towards charles manson

7507.599 --> 7510.0
i mean

7511.28 --> 7514.239
charles manson

7514.48 --> 7518.919999999999
looks better than sean hawkins

7520.159 --> 7525.679
i mean that guy like he's crazy but at

7523.44 --> 7527.28
least he has some higher faculties

7525.679 --> 7531.28
available to him

7527.28 --> 7534.079
sean doesn't he really doesn't i mean

7531.28 --> 7537.199
high level faculties for sean are like

7534.079 --> 7539.44
oh he can actually halfway act like a

7537.199 --> 7542.159
normal human being that's a good moment

7539.44 --> 7544.638999999999
that's his speak right when he almost

7542.159 --> 7547.36
seems like a regular person

7544.639 --> 7549.84
charles manson had higher intellectual

7547.36 --> 7549.839999999999
faculties

7560.719 --> 7565.44
that's right

7562.4 --> 7567.92
he did put thought into his actions

7565.44 --> 7571.678999999999
and he had like messages to share that

7567.92 --> 7571.679
were actually had a point

7575.119 --> 7580.0
anyway

7576.8 --> 7583.56
oh been going for two hours already man

7580.0 --> 7583.56
time's been flying

7616.96 --> 7622.119
i don't even know what he's talking

7618.4 --> 7622.119
about at this point

7650.719 --> 7654.56
it's

7652.239 --> 7655.598999999999
that's that's very noble of you psych

7654.56 --> 7658.639
bear but

7655.599 --> 7661.52
i think sean already has done that

7658.639 --> 7663.36
all he does is just start yelling and

7661.52 --> 7664.88
rumpusing and

7663.36 --> 7667.199
like

7664.88 --> 7669.84
you know some of the anti-flat earthers

7667.199 --> 7672.0
they actually managed to romp as you

7669.84 --> 7673.599
while you're answering a question or

7672.0 --> 7676.4
explaining something

7673.599 --> 7679.119000000001
with something that is actually relevant

7676.4 --> 7681.5199999999995
to the subject right they usually romp

7679.119 --> 7683.839999999999
us with that it's very annoying still

7681.52 --> 7685.040000000001
sean doesn't even do that

7683.84 --> 7688.719
he just

7685.04 --> 7690.96
starts making noise through you he's not

7688.719 --> 7693.199
even pretending to have an argument that

7690.96 --> 7695.599
he just accidentally had to roll out

7693.199 --> 7697.28
right there no he just makes noise

7695.599 --> 7698.639
through you

7697.28 --> 7701.599
okay

7698.639 --> 7704.639
that's how good a debater he is

7701.599 --> 7707.52
i mean he's not even proficient at basic

7704.639 --> 7709.599
anti-flat earth strategy

7707.52 --> 7711.4400000000005
you can't even act

7709.599 --> 7713.52
like you're actually in the know of what

7711.44 --> 7716.5199999999995
you're talking about sean you're that

7713.52 --> 7716.52
sucky

7728.4 --> 7733.36
yelled not saying yelling i'm just

7731.44 --> 7735.5199999999995
saying that when you rump as an

7733.36 --> 7738.32
interrupt you don't even rump us an

7735.52 --> 7740.56
interrupt with actual

7738.32 --> 7743.28
words or information relevant to the

7740.56 --> 7745.360000000001
subject you just make noise you just get

7743.28 --> 7747.44
annoying

7745.36 --> 7750.239
you're way too quick to jump to the at

7747.44 --> 7753.598999999999
home every single time you're like

7750.239 --> 7755.199
pretty much 75 at home of everything you

7753.599 --> 7756.88
say

7755.199 --> 7757.759999999999
it's like

7756.88 --> 7759.92
that's

7757.76 --> 7761.4400000000005
there's no way there's literally not a

7759.92 --> 7764.56
person in this world that's going to

7761.44 --> 7767.28
have you on to have a debate with on the

7764.56 --> 7769.599
flattery side there's just no way

7767.28 --> 7769.599
because

7769.679 --> 7773.04
right it's like picking a fight with

7771.92 --> 7774.4
like a

7773.04 --> 7778.0
a severely

7774.4 --> 7778.0
physically handicapped person

7779.199 --> 7783.678999999999
yeah it's like no no you're not gonna

7781.36 --> 7787.04
fight them even if they are being a dick

7783.679 --> 7789.36
because like yeah then you just fought a

7787.04 --> 7791.5199999999995
[ __ ] [ __ ] that's like really

7789.36 --> 7793.5199999999995
[ __ ] up what's the point right

7791.52 --> 7798.159000000001
nobody's gonna debate you because you

7793.52 --> 7798.159000000001
are mentally [ __ ] sean

7799.36 --> 7805.92
and you don't have anything to say

7803.44 --> 7808.0
you don't have arguments if you had

7805.92 --> 7811.119
you'd be presenting them all you do is

7808.0 --> 7814.239
have stupid refuted trick questions

7811.119 --> 7817.5199999999995
based on presuppositional models all of

7814.239 --> 7820.239
it has been addressed to fine detail for

7817.52 --> 7823.280000000001
years yet you keep rolling out the same

7820.239 --> 7826.239
stupid [ __ ] over and over again

7823.28 --> 7828.96
expecting a different result right why

7826.239 --> 7831.839999999999
because you're an idiot

7828.96 --> 7834.8
by the very definition of the word that

7831.84 --> 7834.8
is what you are

7839.04 --> 7844.719
an idiot is somebody that keeps

7841.92 --> 7847.1990000000005
repeating the same stupid [ __ ]

7844.719 --> 7849.199
expecting a different result that is

7847.199 --> 7851.28
what you are sean

7849.199 --> 7854.0
that's like the core essence that

7851.28 --> 7857.84
everybody associates with you

7854.0 --> 7857.84
because of what you do

7871.36 --> 7874.36
um

7886.56 --> 7891.84
keep repeating the same way i do do i

7888.88 --> 7894.84
repeat the same stuff every day

7891.84 --> 7894.84
really

7902.32 --> 7908.759999999999
yeah right back

7904.159 --> 7908.759999999999
but it is true though right

7921.98 --> 7925.049999999999
[Music]

7927.3 --> 7930.669
[Music]

7931.44 --> 7934.44
ugh

7946.96 --> 7952.0
right

7948.159 --> 7953.598999999999
uh yeah sean hawkins main problem is

7952.0 --> 7955.76
like

7953.599 --> 7958.079
he's a glober that wants to be an

7955.76 --> 7961.76
anti-flat earther but he's just not

7958.079 --> 7963.84
smart enough to actually pull it off

7961.76 --> 7966.8
because to be an anti-flat earther you

7963.84 --> 7969.360000000001
have to be proficient

7966.8 --> 7972.8
and constant double think

7969.36 --> 7974.48
you have to like know how to re-manage

7972.8 --> 7977.679
your spirit

7974.48 --> 7980.839999999999
but sean hawkins is so incompetent he

7977.679 --> 7983.04
just falls back into actual globe

7980.84 --> 7984.96
ignorance because it just

7983.04 --> 7988.079
it can't

7984.96 --> 7990.2390000000005
actually get a grip

7988.079 --> 7992.88
he can't do it

7990.239 --> 7995.759999999999
he's not smart enough to be an anti-flat

7992.88 --> 7997.76
earther maybe that's better for him

7995.76 --> 8000.56
you know because who the hell would want

7997.76 --> 8002.4800000000005
to be one anyway

8000.56 --> 8003.52
i mean that's pretty disgusting way to

8002.48 --> 8006.079
go about

8003.52 --> 8006.079000000001
in your life

8009.28 --> 8014.4
i mean if i'd had to choose like i am a

8011.52 --> 8017.76
clinical [ __ ] or i'm an anti-flat

8014.4 --> 8019.839999999999
earther dude i'd choose clinical [ __ ]

8017.76 --> 8020.8
absolutely

8019.84 --> 8023.360000000001
i mean

8020.8 --> 8024.400000000001
clinical retards at least have some

8023.36 --> 8026.719
dignity

8024.4 --> 8029.199
right at least they're like oh they

8026.719 --> 8031.599
can't help it

8029.199 --> 8034.5599999999995
at least they didn't choose

8031.599 --> 8036.84
to just become an overt liar and think

8034.56 --> 8038.4800000000005
they're all great for it

8036.84 --> 8041.84
right

8038.48 --> 8044.879999999999
i i choose clinical [ __ ] over

8041.84 --> 8044.88
anti-flat earther

8047.28 --> 8052.599
so maybe sean is actually the lucky one

8053.119 --> 8058.32
i mean

8055.04 --> 8061.28
at least you're too stupid to become

8058.32 --> 8064.28
really evil

8061.28 --> 8064.28
so

8067.36 --> 8071.44
aren't they both the same no no no kill

8069.199 --> 8073.759999999999
kenny no no

8071.44 --> 8076.5599999999995
no anti-flat earthers and globers are

8073.76 --> 8076.56
very different

8079.28 --> 8083.5199999999995
like a glober is basically still going

8081.76 --> 8085.76
about

8083.52 --> 8088.079000000001
the their views from an innocent

8085.76 --> 8089.92
perspective they just go about their

8088.079 --> 8091.679
conditioning and they are not really

8089.92 --> 8093.4400000000005
informed they might have obstacles in

8091.679 --> 8095.28
their mind like oh i don't understand

8093.44 --> 8097.839999999999
this flat earth what are you talking

8095.28 --> 8101.199
about i don't believe it right that's a

8097.84 --> 8103.76
global an anti-flat earther knows all

8101.199 --> 8106.32
the flat earth arguments they know about

8103.76 --> 8107.280000000001
the scene they know what's going on out

8106.32 --> 8108.4
there

8107.28 --> 8111.679
and they

8108.4 --> 8113.5199999999995
basically like politicians rearrange

8111.679 --> 8116.4800000000005
whatever is happening

8113.52 --> 8119.76
in order to try and diffuse the well

8116.48 --> 8121.44
worked out arguments

8119.76 --> 8123.92
so they're focusing more on just

8121.44 --> 8125.678999999999
slandering making the others look bad

8123.92 --> 8127.599
and distracting

8125.679 --> 8130.079
the audience away

8127.599 --> 8131.679
from the focused clear-cut arguments

8130.079 --> 8133.759999999999
that flat earthers have that's what

8131.679 --> 8135.28
anti-flag earth is do they're much more

8133.76 --> 8138.0
focused they're smarter they're very

8135.28 --> 8140.639
manipulative you might mistake them for

8138.0 --> 8141.76
politicians right globers aren't like

8140.639 --> 8143.679
that

8141.76 --> 8145.4400000000005
globals are just like oh no of course

8143.679 --> 8146.4
it's a globe because everywhere is a

8145.44 --> 8149.44
globe

8146.4 --> 8149.44
right right

8149.52 --> 8153.280000000001
so there is a distinct difference

8157.84 --> 8161.2390000000005
yo sean

8166.159 --> 8172.0
you're spamming up my chat bro

8169.84 --> 8172.88
this is getting a bit tedious

8172.0 --> 8174.88
i mean

8172.88 --> 8176.56
if you're gonna try to insult me then at

8174.88 --> 8179.28
least try to be a little bit more

8176.56 --> 8181.76
creative and don't just spam the same

8179.28 --> 8185.48
[ __ ] over and over again it gets

8181.76 --> 8185.4800000000005
kind of tedious

8199.439 --> 8203.84
what

8201.12 --> 8203.84
is

8204.84 --> 8211.359
what tell us how the weather changes the

8208.559 --> 8213.039999999999
size of earth what the [ __ ]

8211.359 --> 8215.84
no sean no that's

8213.04 --> 8218.559000000001
terrestrial refraction that's

8215.84 --> 8222.16
that's an anti-flat earther claim

8218.559 --> 8224.399
why would i tell you that

8222.16 --> 8224.399
what

8228.88 --> 8232.839999999998
what are you talking about

8231.2 --> 8236.639000000001
this is getting really

8232.84 --> 8236.639000000001
funny oh [ __ ]

8247.28 --> 8254.16
oh okay kilgenny just open up to effie

8250.8 --> 8254.16
didn't know right

8254.8 --> 8258.319
right yeah it's it's okay kill kenny

8257.04 --> 8261.319000000001
there's like

8258.319 --> 8261.319
different

8262.96 --> 8266.719
like

8264.24 --> 8268.24
it's like group things

8266.719 --> 8269.119999999999
things in the group that are talked

8268.24 --> 8271.359
about

8269.12 --> 8271.359
like

8272.8 --> 8278.8
or rather like uh

8275.28 --> 8281.12
the descriptions of the social landscape

8278.8 --> 8282.88
right it's

8281.12 --> 8285.679
if you're gonna bump into that for the

8282.88 --> 8287.679
first time you're not gonna get it

8285.679 --> 8289.76
if you don't get an explanation for it

8287.679 --> 8292.24
and that's why i just gave it

8289.76 --> 8293.84
but yeah that's been

8292.24 --> 8296.8
around for a while the terminology

8293.84 --> 8298.719000000001
anti-flat earth is pretty much

8296.8 --> 8300.399
this year

8298.719 --> 8303.279999999999
i think

8300.399 --> 8306.24
or is it longer was it last year

8303.28 --> 8308.719000000001
i think either beginning this year no

8306.24 --> 8313.16
it must be longer i think that probably

8308.719 --> 8313.16
nathan introduced it somewhere in 2021

8313.679 --> 8318.559
because yeah we couldn't really compare

8316.559 --> 8321.279999999999
one global to another there's just

8318.559 --> 8323.679
fanatics that constantly lie and deceive

8321.28 --> 8325.599
like politicians and there's just people

8323.679 --> 8326.8
that just happen to think it's still a

8325.599 --> 8329.439
globe

8326.8 --> 8332.479
right and they're so far apart that

8329.439 --> 8334.880000000001
nathan oakley decided to basically

8332.479 --> 8337.279999999999
reclassify them as anti-flat earthers

8334.88 --> 8339.119999999999
because they are obsessed

8337.28 --> 8341.439
with flat earthers and trying to tear

8339.12 --> 8343.679
them down

8341.439 --> 8345.76
normal globers aren't like that normal

8343.679 --> 8347.679
globers aren't obsessed with flat

8345.76 --> 8350.639000000001
earthers and tearing them down

8347.679 --> 8353.599
they might be like freaked out by it or

8350.639 --> 8355.759999999998
like oh get away from me

8353.599 --> 8357.92
but they're not gonna be like oh we

8355.76 --> 8360.16
gotta stop the flat earthers that's not

8357.92 --> 8363.2
what globers do

8360.16 --> 8365.2
if you don't know about flat earth

8363.2 --> 8366.800000000001
and you think it's a globe then hearing

8365.2 --> 8368.08
about flat earth is like

8366.8 --> 8369.199999999999
what

8368.08 --> 8371.2
really

8369.2 --> 8373.76
they still what they still think it's

8371.2 --> 8374.639000000001
flat what what's going on here that's

8373.76 --> 8377.04
weird

8374.639 --> 8379.92
right that's a natural response that's a

8377.04 --> 8383.12
global response

8379.92 --> 8383.12
so there's a big difference

8386.08 --> 8389.84
what is he saying now

8397.68 --> 8401.84
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

8399.68 --> 8403.76
sean

8401.84 --> 8405.92
really think you could straw man me with

8403.76 --> 8408.399
a [ __ ] remark like that

8405.92 --> 8410.72
i mean guys in chat you've been

8408.399 --> 8416.96
following me some of you for years

8410.72 --> 8418.8
have i ever said ever even a single time

8416.96 --> 8422.56
that

8418.8 --> 8424.88
the size of earth gets bigger depending

8422.56 --> 8425.76
on the weather conditions

8424.88 --> 8430.24
like

8425.76 --> 8433.28
no that's a terrestrial refraction based

8430.24 --> 8434.64
necessary claim it's not a claim that i

8433.28 --> 8436.800000000001
have

8434.64 --> 8438.8
our win being right it's my claim is

8436.8 --> 8439.92
baldwin for sure

8438.8 --> 8441.279999999999
right

8439.92 --> 8443.12
but that's just

8441.28 --> 8445.439
you don't have to worry about that sean

8443.12 --> 8447.6
because that's for smart people that are

8445.439 --> 8449.68
actually designing the dream that you so

8447.6 --> 8452.16
desperately believe in

8449.68 --> 8454.399
you shouldn't be concerned about that

8452.16 --> 8454.399
right

8454.479 --> 8458.24
it's not good for you it's just gonna

8456.319 --> 8460.8
give you a headache and make you more

8458.24 --> 8463.68
triggered

8460.8 --> 8465.279999999999
but yeah me as a the real

8463.68 --> 8467.92
arwyn

8465.28 --> 8469.76
flat earther no i don't have a claim

8467.92 --> 8472.16
that the shape

8469.76 --> 8474.960000000001
or the size of earth changes depending

8472.16 --> 8477.119999999999
on the weather you've got to be really

8474.96 --> 8477.119999999999
just

8477.76 --> 8480.960000000001
sean hawkins okay

8481.439 --> 8486.439
it is shawn hawkins i shouldn't be

8483.439 --> 8486.439
surprised

8493.2 --> 8498.960000000001
showed up just in time well not really

8495.76 --> 8498.960000000001
you showed up kind of late

8499.52 --> 8503.68
i'm already two hours and 20 minutes

8502.0 --> 8505.84
into the show

8503.68 --> 8508.0
i was actually about to round it out but

8505.84 --> 8511.439
then sean hawkins just kept on squirting

8508.0 --> 8511.439
in my chat and i thought like

8512.24 --> 8517.479
maybe i should poke him a bit

8544.399 --> 8546.72
what

8552.16 --> 8557.72
what

8553.28 --> 8557.720000000001
the [ __ ] is he blabbering about

8560.34 --> 8563.44
[Music]

8565.6 --> 8572.800000000001
no they don't you delusional

8569.84 --> 8574.960000000001
i just stop lying you're just lying like

8572.8 --> 8577.599999999999
like a naughty little boy you need some

8574.96 --> 8577.599999999999
spanking

8578.56 --> 8580.88
dude

8583.52 --> 8587.2
i wish your dad was still around so he

8585.28 --> 8589.76
could put you over his knee and give you

8587.2 --> 8592.720000000001
a good spanking because you are being a

8589.76 --> 8596.08
lying naughty little boy right now

8592.72 --> 8598.88
i just just stop overtly lying

8596.08 --> 8601.12
yeah i hope i really hope for you you

8598.88 --> 8604.08
don't do that to people in their faces

8601.12 --> 8605.92
because they are going to punch you the

8604.08 --> 8608.399
[ __ ] out sean

8605.92 --> 8609.84
if you're gonna lie that hard

8608.399 --> 8613.439
to their face

8609.84 --> 8615.84
they're gonna punch you out

8613.439 --> 8619.28
and they should

8615.84 --> 8620.72
because that's just disgusting

8619.28 --> 8623.84
stop

8620.72 --> 8627.039999999999
making ridiculous claims about what we

8623.84 --> 8629.92
say that obviously anybody that's

8627.04 --> 8633.720000000001
watching for like longer than a second

8629.92 --> 8633.72
knows we don't

8641.76 --> 8646.24
what

8643.2 --> 8648.0
that doesn't make sense sean are you

8646.24 --> 8651.28
going psychotic

8648.0 --> 8651.28
jesus christ

8651.439 --> 8656.16
how can you make a screenshot of

8654.479 --> 8658.279999999999
somebody

8656.16 --> 8660.0
saying

8658.28 --> 8662.720000000001
saying

8660.0 --> 8666.64
sound how can you make a screenshot of

8662.72 --> 8668.479
somebody saying so you're [ __ ] insane

8666.64 --> 8670.56
dude

8668.479 --> 8674.279999999999
you're insane

8670.56 --> 8674.279999999999
you're losing it

8682.88 --> 8688.599999999999
that it on a video

8685.04 --> 8688.6
that's not a screenshot

8696.08 --> 8701.2
good one rick beck now but he doesn't

8698.08 --> 8701.2
have enough money

8705.12 --> 8710.399000000001
i mean that's gonna be like yeah if if

8707.76 --> 8712.319
it's lower fee than most right

8710.399 --> 8714.64
but yeah my fee is still going to be

8712.319 --> 8716.72
like 500 euros at least and he's not

8714.64 --> 8717.84
gonna pay that

8716.72 --> 8720.96
like

8717.84 --> 8724.6
no it's ridiculous like he couldn't get

8720.96 --> 8724.599999999999
that out of it

8728.96 --> 8732.64
he set it in a chat

8733.04 --> 8736.640000000001
well

8733.84 --> 8739.2
sean hawkins you know nathan

8736.64 --> 8741.84
in chat gets kind of ridiculous i mean

8739.2 --> 8743.439
he also says in chat that he's actually

8741.84 --> 8745.28
a black woman

8743.439 --> 8747.6
and that certain thing saying certain

8745.28 --> 8749.6
things offends him because of that

8747.6 --> 8752.319
so yeah

8749.6 --> 8754.479000000001
nathan can get quite silly in chat

8752.319 --> 8756.88
that's not really good proof

8754.479 --> 8758.72
offered yeah that's not enough

8756.88 --> 8762.24
and you didn't by the way you haven't

8758.72 --> 8762.24
offered me 100 that's a lie

8763.84 --> 8767.68
right

8764.88 --> 8772.438999999998
that's not enough

8767.68 --> 8772.439

8793.28 --> 8796.880000000001

8795.68 --> 8798.880000000001
how it is

8796.88 --> 8801.199999999999

8798.88 --> 8803.519999999999
chats

8801.2 --> 8804.479000000001
because he just gets in a weird mood

there

8804.479 --> 8810.24
and he's like [ __ ] you i'm just gonna
