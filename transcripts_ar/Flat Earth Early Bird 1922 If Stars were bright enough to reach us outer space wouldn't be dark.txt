95.52 --> 101.52
nicer it's a bit clouded here and there

98.159 --> 101.52000000000001
but it's also nice and

106.119 --> 110.04
sunny it's almost no

116.079 --> 120.36
wind by the way a weird realization is

119.119 --> 123.52
that

120.36 --> 128.52
mint plant hasn't been doing very well I

123.52 --> 131.12
thought I would like just start

128.52 --> 132.76000000000002
regreening but it's not really seem to

131.12 --> 136.0
be doing that

132.76 --> 139.16
so that's kind of weird rosemary plants

136.0 --> 139.16
doing just fine

140.68 --> 145.959
though but yeah we'll see what happens

143.319 --> 145.95899999999997
with that mint

147.68 --> 154.56
plant hello Gary f first in chat good to

151.04 --> 154.56
see you Clary good to see

155.56 --> 164.68
you how you

158.159 --> 164.67999999999998
doing it is Thursday the 18th of April

178.319 --> 186.319
2024 temperature is 12Â°

183.0 --> 186.319
C no

189.4 --> 194.239
rain still 55%

196.92 --> 200.64
humidity looks like the coming week's

199.04 --> 204.12
going to be pretty much the same type of

200.64 --> 204.11999999999998
weather as this

236.599 --> 241.04
right so yeah

248.72 --> 254.519
feel a little weird this morning yeah

255.04 --> 260.12
me maybe it's because I went to bed a

257.759 --> 260.12
little

262.52 --> 268.479
late not exactly sure I'm really going

265.44 --> 271.56
to try to go to bed

268.479 --> 275.59999999999997
earlier to today cuz I I don't know I

271.56 --> 278.52
feel kind of weird weird and tired it's

275.6 --> 283.24
weird can't really place

278.52 --> 285.79999999999995
it maybe it's just from sitting next to

283.24 --> 285.8
Wi-Fi

291.44 --> 297.88
transmitter

294.28 --> 299.84
right have a little less than a if

297.88 --> 302.44
everything goes well little less than

299.84 --> 306.4
two weeks I have to sit through

302.44 --> 312.08
that till things should be going back to

306.4 --> 312.08
normal somewhere in two weeks I really

318.44 --> 324.039
hopes

321.199 --> 326.52000000000004
right but yeah it has been good to have

324.039 --> 330.28
internet back and to just like watch

326.52 --> 330.28
stuff and all that

334.72 --> 341.08000000000004
watching a bit of Infowars here and

337.28 --> 344.28
there old Benjamin yesterday was a lot

341.08 --> 344.28
of fun

360.639 --> 366.96000000000004
right got a coffee at the stand on the

362.68 --> 366.96
standby as well as Illuminati

375.4 --> 381.039
C maybe I'll turn on the coffee

385.919 --> 390.88
ready it's just kind of weird that

388.36 --> 393.52000000000004
around this time that I feel tired like

390.88 --> 397.759
doesn't make any look like I'm not used

393.52 --> 401.19899999999996
to that it's weird anyway I should

397.759 --> 405.199
probably be recovering in the

401.199 --> 405.199
next 20 minutes or

411.16 --> 417.59900000000005
something I've been eating fine so can't

414.28 --> 417.599
be that

424.44 --> 429.0
right and if everything goes all right I

426.36 --> 430.91900000000004
should be able to just do another full

429.0 --> 434.24
show

430.919 --> 437.919
today but it could be that at some point

434.24 --> 441.08
like my internet just kind of like the

437.919 --> 442.68
the data amount runs out I'm not

441.08 --> 447.919
entirely

442.68 --> 450.96
sure so if the show just suddenly cuts

447.919 --> 452.44
off well it could also be yeah no it can

450.96 --> 454.919
be like

452.44 --> 457.759
disconnecting that would be a logical if

454.919 --> 461.31899999999996
I disconnect it's probably my data

457.759 --> 465.12
minutes the data amount running out and

461.319 --> 469.199
then I will try to like reup it but yeah

465.12 --> 469.199
that will definitely cut off the show

469.599 --> 474.8
so

471.12 --> 478.8
but probably not for a

474.8 --> 478.8
while anyway

480.68 --> 483.8
hope you guys are doing all

489.72 --> 494.319
right don't forget to share the show and

492.639 --> 499.24
Rogan's it

494.319 --> 501.599
up and hey if you if you have any uh

499.24 --> 504.199
suggestion on what you want me to talk

501.599 --> 507.599
about especially in

504.199 --> 511.2
the lineup of my typical subjects then

507.599 --> 515.56
let me know now will address

511.2 --> 515.56
it it'll definitely get me

519.56 --> 526.0
rolling I have to just like get out of

522.0 --> 526.0
this rut for a moment

552.079 --> 560.16
were some weird and disturbing

556.72 --> 560.1600000000001
articles about

561.72 --> 571.36
YouTube that were kind of worrisome a

565.48 --> 571.36
little apparently in the United States

573.32 --> 577.72
like

574.6 --> 580.12
courts basically ask YouTube to hand

577.72 --> 583.399
over data from

580.12 --> 586.839
users even for just watching certain

583.399 --> 586.839
videos that was kind of

591.56 --> 597.4799999999999
weird it's not a good

595.36 --> 602.5600000000001
development

597.48 --> 605.5600000000001
right but yeah I doubt that anybody here

602.56 --> 607.92
or myself is going to be targeted by

605.56 --> 611.88
such a thing since I'm

607.92 --> 615.76
like a goodie two shoes

611.88 --> 619.959
here at least I am these

615.76 --> 622.079
days it's not going to be a rage win for

619.959 --> 624.64
maybe

622.079 --> 626.7199999999999
ever at least not while I'm in this type

624.64 --> 630.72
of

626.72 --> 630.72
state right

638.44 --> 641.9590000000001
uh were some

642.12 --> 648.9590000000001
interesting videos also bumped into on

645.6 --> 650.6
Twitter about the whole cloud seeding

648.959 --> 653.5999999999999
thing

650.6 --> 653.6
in

654.079 --> 661.2399999999999
Dubai how that works it just like popped

657.24 --> 661.24
up kind of interesting

668.32 --> 675.7600000000001
seeing a lot of criticism also on

672.079 --> 678.279
supposed uh environmentally friendly

675.76 --> 678.279
energy

679.639 --> 685.92
sources like windmills CU there's

683.36 --> 688.6
apparently plans here to expand on the

685.92 --> 691.3199999999999
windmill park in the North Sea but

688.6 --> 693.9200000000001
that's going to happen have like

691.32 --> 698.519
provable terrible

693.92 --> 699.8389999999999
consequences for the actual life in and

698.519 --> 702.0
above the

699.839 --> 708.44
ocean Whoa

702.0 --> 708.44
man some blood images here it's pretty

712.639 --> 718.04
dramatic maybe I'll share that for a bit

725.959 --> 731.279
that is pretty

728.519 --> 734.44
extreme look at

731.279 --> 739.56
this this is in

734.44 --> 739.5600000000001
Dubai pretty heavy blood there

759.32 --> 766.0790000000001
Cloud seaing yeah oh they are blaming

762.76 --> 766.079
the cloud seeding but

766.88 --> 774.4399999999999
the the organization that basically take

771.36 --> 776.9590000000001
takes care of that is denying that that

774.44 --> 779.9590000000001
they did anything to basically cause

776.959 --> 779.959
this

790.36 --> 795.8000000000001
but yeah a some dramatic flooding

792.8 --> 795.8
imagery

808.02 --> 812.4399999999999
[Music]

809.36 --> 814.24
oh big Premier really making fun of me

812.44 --> 818.24
oh

814.24 --> 819.72
God yeah I I heard about that I I don't

818.24 --> 823.44

839.959 --> 843.8
what's there to make fun of I don't get

848.0 --> 854.639
it so yeah I can't really be bothered

851.04 --> 857.959
too much with with that but thanks for

854.639 --> 857.9590000000001
telling me

872.199 --> 876.8
bunch of familiar names no doubt

918.68 --> 923.399
making fun of my internet connection

924.72 --> 929.519
wow I mean how how do you even make fun

928.079 --> 933.12
of that

929.519 --> 933.12
it's just weird

975.199 --> 982.7589999999999
okay man go I mean I sent out a

979.12 --> 985.319
tweet like a week ago now about the

982.759 --> 987.72
situation so you could have known that

985.319 --> 990.7199999999999
earlier why I hadn't shown up for a

987.72 --> 990.72
while

993.3 --> 996.4599999999999
[Music]

1004.04 --> 1007.399
right but I'm here now

1007.89 --> 1011.1
[Music]

1015.759 --> 1020.839
so let's just try to make the best of it

1024.64 --> 1028.72
don't forget to share the show and

1026.12 --> 1028.7199999999998
Rogan's it

right so yeah pardon me for being a

1190.32 --> 1193.9189999999999
maybe a little low energy at the

1191.88 --> 1197.0390000000002
beginning of my show although yeah I

1193.919 --> 1200.64
mean I guess normally I am a little bit

1197.039 --> 1200.64
slow to start up

1202.24 --> 1208.84
I will get back into it as soon as I

1205.08 --> 1210.36
can but any suggestion on conversations

1208.84 --> 1214.28
or interesting

1210.36 --> 1214.28
subjects are always going to be

1219.72 --> 1225.96
helpful and I bet my coffee will help as

1222.559 --> 1225.96
well soon

yeah days it is

1240.2 --> 1244.32

1246.0 --> 1250.71
restful although yeah I didn't have like

1248.52 --> 1253.809

in when I've had that like pretty much

1258.36 --> 1265.0
every every day for last week so maybe

1260.76 --> 1269.039
that's part of it I missed out on

1265.0 --> 1272.52
that like it does really heal me a

1269.039 --> 1274.84
lot on the other hand I did also have

1272.52 --> 1277.679
like the healing from my healer

1274.84 --> 1279.799
yesterday and that that was even before

1277.679 --> 1279.799
the

1280.96 --> 1287.1200000000001
show that must have

1283.08 --> 1291.6
helped cuz I did like feel a lot more

1287.12 --> 1291.6
stable but yeah I don't know what it

1291.72 --> 1297.279
is but uh yeah I'm eager to start

mean newswise it's mostly just kind of

1416.88 --> 1419.7600000000002
just crappy

1420.12 --> 1424.6
stuff like my government's like

1424.679 --> 1432.159
still sending money over to

1428.679 --> 1435.72
Ukraine well the whole situation here is

1432.159 --> 1435.72
just like collapsing and

1436.6 --> 1443.7199999999998
everything but it's not really something

1439.0 --> 1443.72
to like talk about it's just going to be

1446.039 --> 1451.039
depressing and like that stuff will just

1448.48 --> 1453.48
smack you in the face if you go

1451.039 --> 1456.679
looking for news and everything hey

1453.48 --> 1456.679
debatable de it's see

1461.64 --> 1467.1200000000001
you I'm getting hungry that's a good

1464.12 --> 1467.12
sign

1483.039 --> 1490.36
Internet working again it was working

1486.84 --> 1493.36
yesterday the b

1490.36 --> 1496.0
d was it the

1493.36 --> 1499.0
firewall yeah it was well when I

1496.0 --> 1501.76
connected up with the uh Wi-Fi F card

1499.0 --> 1501.76
yeah it was the

1509.64 --> 1516.679
firewall but like

1512.64 --> 1518.64
uh for Downing the amount of radiation

1516.679 --> 1520.5590000000002
and everything and like Wi-Fi is never

1518.64 --> 1523.2
really that super stable especially if

1520.559 --> 1526.8799999999999
you try like YouTube live streaming

1523.2 --> 1529.799
which like like there's a lot of data

1526.88 --> 1533.8400000000001
traffic when you do that so I just

1529.799 --> 1533.84
basically have it plugged in with the

1534.72 --> 1543.32
USB and

1536.919 --> 1543.3200000000002
uh that that works just fine like that

1578.559 --> 1584.039
when will my internet be

1580.96 --> 1588.3990000000001
fixed if everything

1584.039 --> 1590.76
goes as plannned the 1st of May

1588.399 --> 1593.8799999999999
although it might take even

1590.76 --> 1597.6
longer so yeah I have to just make do

1593.88 --> 1600.919
with with this emergency internet

1597.6 --> 1600.9189999999999
system in the

1601.48 --> 1606.44
meantime and hope that everything just

1603.88 --> 1606.44
goes

1609.88 --> 1614.88
smoothly right and hopefully I'll be

1612.12 --> 1617.7199999999998
able to do a show every day but I mean I

1614.88 --> 1620.5590000000002
can't guarantee it some it might be that

1617.72 --> 1624.84
I'll I'll get get into trouble with it

1620.559 --> 1628.48
or not able to like up the data in

1624.84 --> 1632.36
time and so

1628.48 --> 1634.679
yeah especially like on Sunday because

1632.36 --> 1637.559
then you can't call the call center to

1634.679 --> 1637.5590000000002
basically up the

1640.48 --> 1646.52
data so I don't know if I can guarantee

1643.24 --> 1650.44
a show every single day but I will be

1646.52 --> 1650.44
doing shows throughout the next two

1659.0 --> 1666.36
weeks uh okay the will yeah very funny

1670.57 --> 1673.75
[Music]

1697.919 --> 1701.88
right but yeah I mean this April

1700.0 --> 1704.88
certainly

1701.88 --> 1707.919
not it's been a

1704.88 --> 1709.279
mess I mean the first week was just fine

1707.919 --> 1712.279
but but

1709.279 --> 1712.279
then

1716.08 --> 1724.4399999999998
yeah had a really good bunch of

1719.36 --> 1724.4399999999998
shows the first week of this April

1756.279 --> 1763.039
yeah April does what it wants take to a

1759.919 --> 1764.679
new level yeah I can definitely say that

1763.039 --> 1769.0
I mean it's not the first time that this

1764.679 --> 1769.0
is happening in April though

1771.279 --> 1778.76
every time there's been internet issues

1773.279 --> 1778.76
I I get like completely out of whack

1816.399 --> 1820.9599999999998
have I been back on fed since I left

1822.24 --> 1827.6
no no I have not l lenx

1835.12 --> 1841.799
I mean technically I could kind of hang

1838.559 --> 1844.399
around it's just that it's not going to

1841.799 --> 1846.9189999999999
be the same

1844.399 --> 1849.0
anymore like I've

1846.919 --> 1851.64
changed and I

1849.0 --> 1855.32
just I mean I left there for a good

1851.64 --> 1858.96
reason I couldn't really handle like

1855.32 --> 1862.72
the like the peer pressure basic

1858.96 --> 1867.2
basically just the way things are done

1862.72 --> 1870.88
there and like it was just I couldn't

1867.2 --> 1870.88
physically couldn't handle

1871.32 --> 1875.76
it

1873.12 --> 1877.6
so I wasn't really planning on going

1875.76 --> 1880.399
back

1877.6 --> 1881.1589999999999
there I mean I might like as a visitor

1880.399 --> 1883.6789999999999
or

1881.159 --> 1885.519
something but that that yeah that's as

1883.679 --> 1888.3990000000001
far as it'll

1885.519 --> 1890.96
go like

1888.399 --> 1894.7199999999998
I'm not even all that interested

1890.96 --> 1899.159
anymore I mean I yeah I have learned a

1894.72 --> 1900.039
lot is just that at in this period it's

1899.159 --> 1903.6390000000001
just

1900.039 --> 1906.639
mostly dealing with anti flat

1903.639 --> 1910.279
earthers and all I'd have to I'd be

1906.639 --> 1913.32
doing is just like psychoanalyzing them

1910.279 --> 1916.0
barely getting a a word

1913.32 --> 1919.84
in and just hearing the same things over

1916.0 --> 1919.84
and over again it's like this is

1921.48 --> 1928.6
not this it isn't working for

1924.799 --> 1932.2
me yeah and Neil is not helping

1928.6 --> 1934.519
either I mean Neil is just like he's

1932.2 --> 1937.32
apparently enjoying the hell out of me

1934.519 --> 1940.44
not being there so like I don't even

1937.32 --> 1943.559
want to like try to get back I just get

1940.44 --> 1946.88
all these people just being like we

1943.559 --> 1948.559
don't want Arwin so I'm like bro I I

1946.88 --> 1952.0390000000002
don't want the [Â __Â ] deal with that

1948.559 --> 1956.24
anymore like really not like ever I

1952.039 --> 1956.24
never ever want to deal with that

1959.159 --> 1964.3600000000001
anymore

1961.36 --> 1964.36
yeah

1966.0 --> 1971.44
never I'm either welcome back or I'm not

1969.36 --> 1974.24
coming back I don't want to deal with

1971.44 --> 1977.6000000000001
people that are like going to try to be

1974.24 --> 1982.96
backstabby or just in your window or all

1977.6 --> 1985.76
that [Â __Â ] I don't want to deal with it

1982.96 --> 1988.6390000000001
ever again

1985.76 --> 1990.8799999999999
ever if that would start happening with

1988.639 --> 1993.559
some other group that I join up I'd

1990.88 --> 1993.5590000000002
leave them

1994.12 --> 2001.559
too I don't want to deal with it I can't

1997.88 --> 2005.159
deal with it it's it's palpably bad for

2001.559 --> 2007.8799999999999
my health to the point where I

2005.159 --> 2010.88
hallucinated because of exposure to it

2007.88 --> 2010.88
I'm not dealing with it

2013.039 --> 2017.679
anymore so I'm just doing my own

2015.88 --> 2019.6000000000001
show right I'm going to get my

2017.679 --> 2021.8400000000001
Illuminati kasan and coffee I'll be

2019.6 --> 2021.84
right

2036.72 --> 2039.72
back

2066.72 --> 2070.6789999999996
for e

2151.16 --> 2159.2799999999997
it all sounds the same now yeah Gary F I

2155.24 --> 2163.3999999999996
know they just like they did

2159.28 --> 2166.76
want me to do that anymore though Gary

2163.4 --> 2168.92
of that was the weirdest issue about it

2166.76 --> 2171.28
they basically like yeah the thing that

2168.92 --> 2171.28
I

2171.599 --> 2177.839
contributed they pushed back against

2174.119 --> 2180.44
that and so like yeah it it just is what

2177.839 --> 2180.44
it is right

2186.4 --> 2189.56
now what

2189.8 --> 2196.04
GP it's none of your damn business What

2192.68 --> 2196.04
GPU my computer

2197.2 --> 2203.16
has sock account [Â __Â ] off

2222.87 --> 2226.239
[Music]

2233.8 --> 2236.8
ah

2264.04 --> 2267.48
hey FS good to see

2275.839 --> 2279.44
you how you doing

2281.16 --> 2284.72
today it started out kind of tired

2283.72 --> 2287.7599999999998
weirdly

2284.72 --> 2289.48
enough but I'm doing a bit better hey

2287.76 --> 2292.48
LSG good to see you

2289.48 --> 2292.48
too

2292.8 --> 2298.48
awesome I got Tom coffee here and

2295.319 --> 2301.079
everything I should be waking up and

2298.48 --> 2306.839
nobody's home so I can like make noise

2301.079 --> 2306.8390000000004
even if you guys want or if I need to

2308.16 --> 2310.8799999999997
weather's kind of

2319.63 --> 2325.56
[Music]

2321.64 --> 2325.56
beautiful could I blue that

2328.96 --> 2337.079
Sky cool Eclipse video oh yeah El she

2332.28 --> 2337.079
had some Eclipse videos that's right

2352.079 --> 2356.61
did you upload them on your

2353.58 --> 2356.61
[Music]

2363.28 --> 2370.28
channel we just got it from the uh

2367.48 --> 2370.28
from the Skype

2390.839 --> 2400.16
group yeah by the way that pass that

2395.359 --> 2403.0789999999997
flat little short of your got 374 views

2400.16 --> 2403.0789999999997
like done pretty

2410.079 --> 2416.28
well Shadows were crazy well the Shadows

2412.88 --> 2416.28
are just like reflecting

2417.76 --> 2424.0400000000004
everything

2420.599 --> 2425.4
like every piece of Shadow is basically

2424.04 --> 2427.96
going to

2425.4 --> 2432.839
reflect the source of the light

2427.96 --> 2432.839
what it's looking like yeah funny isn't

2435.119 --> 2441.28
that so I knew that that typically

2438.2 --> 2441.2799999999997
happens it's

2443.28 --> 2448.079
interesting it's not the first Eclipse

2445.88 --> 2452.319
video where somebody

2448.079 --> 2452.319
showed what happened

2470.64 --> 2476.0789999999997
I think you can technically even do that

2472.68 --> 2479.1189999999997
with like a manmade light like a big

2476.079 --> 2480.92
flashlight and you put a a dark disc in

2479.119 --> 2484.2400000000002
front of

2480.92 --> 2488.839
it then it'll do the same

2484.24 --> 2488.839
thing funny isn't it

2513.0 --> 2516.0
what

2519.68 --> 2524.44
play as a tune on the football but

2525.48 --> 2531.599
what what are you talking about K what

2528.24 --> 2531.5989999999997
does that mean

2570.96 --> 2576.079
right I'm going to take a bite on my

2573.079 --> 2576.079
illuminatio

2576.119 --> 2580.1600000000003
cheers for

2635.92 --> 2640.4
okay the B will be

2637.92 --> 2640.4
enjoy

2666.04 --> 2670.079
that for

2709.359 --> 2713.52
all right see you later man go

2726.14 --> 2731.5589999999997
[Music]

2728.559 --> 2731.559
ah

2750.73 --> 2753.92
[Applause]

2760.43 --> 2763.48
[Music]

2783.2 --> 2786.2
what

2788.599 --> 2794.2400000000002
clipping my

2790.88 --> 2794.2400000000002
highlights out of

2798.0 --> 2801.0
shorts

2805.72 --> 2811.64
maybe but I mean yeah no not really

2815.599 --> 2824.4
actually I mean that could always be

2819.4 --> 2824.4
done eventually or afterward or

2827.559 --> 2835.2000000000003
anything it's just that I I wouldn't

2830.0 --> 2835.2
really know what what the clip

2835.72 --> 2842.7599999999998
exactly I've talked about similar

2839.24 --> 2847.0789999999997
subjects so many times I'm just used

2842.76 --> 2849.96
to Rolling it out live every time and

2847.079 --> 2852.76
because I do that I keep also improving

2849.96 --> 2852.76
upon the

2859.2 --> 2863.48
explanations some of interesting topics

2861.64 --> 2866.1189999999997
you bring up would make good

2863.48 --> 2871.2400000000002
shorts I guess

2866.119 --> 2871.2400000000002
so I mean if you have any specific

2872.68 --> 2877.3999999999996
suggestions with the show in a time

2874.839 --> 2881.92
stamp or whatever

2877.4 --> 2881.92
I I'd consider it maybe trying it

2904.68 --> 2912.48
out but I mean like taking

2909.119 --> 2914.96
clips from my flat Earth early bird show

2912.48 --> 2917.839
for shorts I don't know if that's like

2914.96 --> 2917.839
suitable for

2922.2 --> 2928.9199999999996
that it it just doesn't really seem like

2925.559 --> 2932.119
a good format for rolling out shorts I

2928.92 --> 2932.119
don't know

2954.16 --> 2958.48
I guess there's no harm in like trying

2956.359 --> 2963.319
it out

2958.48 --> 2963.319
sometime just to see what happens

2982.88 --> 2987.76
but even if I'm going to attempt to do

2985.559 --> 2990.28
that I'm not going to do it like in the

2987.76 --> 2990.28
next two

2992.4 --> 3001.119
weeks with certainty so maybe around the

2996.96 --> 3001.119
I might try it out here and there

3030.52 --> 3038.04
I mean for example my explanations

3034.559 --> 3041.0400000000004
about the celestial

3038.04 --> 3046.16
lights

3041.04 --> 3046.16
right the nonlocal holographic angular

3046.96 --> 3052.44
manifestations I could like make a good

3049.559 --> 3055.8390000000004
short out of

3052.44 --> 3058.599
that and then just like separately

3055.839 --> 3062.119
record it

3058.599 --> 3065.1600000000003
like just the camera and just like

3062.119 --> 3066.079
hey you know that sun you see you think

3065.16 --> 3068.839
that

3066.079 --> 3070.4
that's a giant ball of fire like I could

3068.839 --> 3074.359
like do a

3070.4 --> 3074.359
three-step explanation about

3074.44 --> 3079.0
it starting out with the

3076.839 --> 3082.92
heliocentric

3079.0 --> 3085.96
perception like this yeah I like

3082.92 --> 3089.92
this like hey you know that Sun out

3085.96 --> 3091.44
there you think that that's a giant ball

3089.92 --> 3093.6800000000003
of

3091.44 --> 3096.4
uh burning

3093.68 --> 3100.16
gas that's like immensely bright and at

3096.4 --> 3103.48
a vast distance in outer space radiating

3100.16 --> 3103.48
out onto the Earth

3105.68 --> 3110.3999999999996
and and flat earthers think that it's

3108.88 --> 3112.96
actually much

3110.4 --> 3116.119
closer well what if it's like not an

3112.96 --> 3118.359
object at all there's no evidence that

3116.119 --> 3121.04
there is

3118.359 --> 3124.0789999999997
that it is an object there's no like

3121.04 --> 3125.72
actual tangible proof other than hey

3124.079 --> 3130.6400000000003
light

3125.72 --> 3132.8799999999997
is manifested is arriving here on Earth

3130.64 --> 3135.64
and there's heat being absorbed at the

3132.88 --> 3139.2400000000002
ground level because of

3135.64 --> 3144.799
it but you can't really trace it back

3139.24 --> 3144.799
other than an a visible angle to it

3148.319 --> 3154.359
so what if there isn't any distance to

3151.119 --> 3155.1600000000003
the Sun at all not far away not millions

3154.359 --> 3159.96
of

3155.16 --> 3162.2
miles not 3,000 miles just none there's

3159.96 --> 3164.52
only an

3162.2 --> 3166.799
apparent

3164.52 --> 3169.96
angle

3166.799 --> 3173.44
apparent cuz if you like physically try

3169.96 --> 3177.64
to go towards the origin Point well it

3173.44 --> 3177.64
doesn't really seem to be there

3180.359 --> 3185.0789999999997
and then other mysterious things about

3182.96 --> 3188.4
it also stand out

3185.079 --> 3193.0
like inverse Square law of

3188.4 --> 3195.6800000000003
light right closer you get to a light

3193.0 --> 3200.839
source the brighter it gets and the

3195.68 --> 3200.839
further way you get from it the it dims

3204.0 --> 3210.68
down it doesn't really seem to apply to

3207.16 --> 3210.68
any of the celestial lights at

3215.119 --> 3220.48
all now of course a baller might say oh

3218.4 --> 3223.079
yeah but it's because they're so far

3220.48 --> 3224.76
away they're so bright like just having

3223.079 --> 3229.4
a bit of distance

3224.76 --> 3229.4
moved on Earth is not going to make a

3230.2 --> 3235.839
difference but technically it would

3232.839 --> 3238.0
because if they were that Bri in order

3235.839 --> 3240.599
for us to be able to see them at that

3238.0 --> 3244.079
distance well then they would brighten

3240.599 --> 3248.28
up everything and we wouldn't have a

3244.079 --> 3249.3590000000004
Blackness of space we would have a outer

3248.28 --> 3253.0400000000004
space

3249.359 --> 3256.48
supposedly that is all lit up by giant

3253.04 --> 3259.119
super bright lights

3256.48 --> 3262.44
everywhere you wouldn't see anything

3259.119 --> 3265.4
like little

3262.44 --> 3267.16
stars it would all just be a giant SE of

3265.4 --> 3269.44
light and I'm not even the first to like

3267.16 --> 3273.0
suggest this like this has been reasen

3269.44 --> 3277.0
out like even in the 20th

3273.0 --> 3277.0
century like a

3277.88 --> 3284.2400000000002
dilemma if you just start to normally

3280.92 --> 3286.48
apply the inverse Square law of light on

3284.24 --> 3286.4799999999996
the

3287.079 --> 3291.76
presupposition of outer space and all

3289.599 --> 3294.76
the Suns that are out

3291.76 --> 3294.76
there

3294.839 --> 3303.2799999999997
then either it just doesn't logically

3298.64 --> 3305.92
add up or it would have to all be so

3303.28 --> 3308.44
bright in order for it to reach you that

3305.92 --> 3310.359
it would well brighten up everything

3308.44 --> 3313.559
around it as well and everything would

3310.359 --> 3316.0
just there wouldn't be any night ever it

3313.559 --> 3318.88
would all just be lit up

3316.0 --> 3323.119
continually you wouldn't see any black

3318.88 --> 3323.119
in between all the stars

3329.559 --> 3334.1600000000003
Celestial lights are really confusing

3331.92 --> 3336.799
when you actually honestly start to

3334.16 --> 3336.799
think about

3337.839 --> 3342.72
them and take in

3340.64 --> 3345.48
the

3342.72 --> 3349.0
consequences of any considerations you

3345.48 --> 3352.119
might have of them as light radiating

3349.0 --> 3352.119
objects at a set

3354.64 --> 3361.0789999999997
distance and really

3357.559 --> 3363.079
my conception of them being non-local

3361.079 --> 3365.48
holographic angular

3363.079 --> 3368.0
manifestations even though that poses

3365.48 --> 3373.559
like how does that actually physically

3368.0 --> 3377.24
work a a problem like that at least

3373.559 --> 3380.28
it doesn't just immediately result in

3377.24 --> 3382.2799999999997
errors in logic as in like oh what got

3380.28 --> 3384.48
to be that distance like oh so how does

3382.28 --> 3387.599
the infr square law of light apply

3384.48 --> 3390.039
then oh yeah it also doesn't work no

3387.599 --> 3390.039
surprise

3392.559 --> 3397.2400000000002
surprise but yeah if it doesn't actually

3395.28 --> 3399.2400000000002
have an origin point then the inverse

3397.24 --> 3403.4399999999996
Square law of light cannot

3399.24 --> 3403.4399999999996
apply it's just an angular

3413.0 --> 3420.319
manifestation the light just comes into

3417.319 --> 3420.319
into being it

3420.48 --> 3427.48
manifests close to us so it manifests

3423.72 --> 3432.2
like on the Earth's surface and we see

3427.48 --> 3432.2
them as a yeah angular

3432.319 --> 3436.2799999999997
manifestations but there's no actual

3443.079 --> 3448.039
distance there's nothing between the

3445.319 --> 3451.4
stars for this to light up

3448.039 --> 3455.0
no no that's wrong did Gary do music if

3451.4 --> 3458.64
it's bright enough to reach

3455.0 --> 3458.64
us all the way

3459.039 --> 3463.28
here then it would be bright enough to

3461.839 --> 3467.119
reach

3463.28 --> 3470.3590000000004
everything and there is stuff in

3467.119 --> 3472.599
between it would be scattering all over

3470.359 --> 3472.5989999999997
the

3474.079 --> 3481.28
place right and Light adds up if there's

3478.48 --> 3483.2
like billions of lights that are that

3481.28 --> 3486.079
bright that'll reach all the way over

3483.2 --> 3490.359
here well they'll reach all the way over

3486.079 --> 3493.52
everywhere then that's the

3490.359 --> 3493.52
point get

3495.079 --> 3499.039
it what is there to light

3499.68 --> 3508.24
up little bits of

3503.319 --> 3508.24
dust tiny particles of air I I

3509.96 --> 3515.68
mean there's a lot of stuff in space

3513.48 --> 3519.48
allegedly according to heliocentrism if

3515.68 --> 3521.8799999999997
there Suns there and

3519.48 --> 3524.28
everything if they're bright enough to

3521.88 --> 3527.599
reach all the way over here then they're

3524.28 --> 3530.7200000000003
bright enough to reach all the way over

3527.599 --> 3533.1600000000003
everywhere and that's like billions of

3530.72 --> 3537.2799999999997
things that are bright enough to reach

3533.16 --> 3537.2799999999997
all the way to everywhere

3538.28 --> 3544.96
that's a lot of light reaching

3542.72 --> 3548.48
everything right

3544.96 --> 3552.76
just imagine how bright it's supposed to

3548.48 --> 3552.76
be to be able to reach that

3553.319 --> 3558.96
far and how many of that is supposed to

3557.24 --> 3561.3999999999996
be there it's like everything there

3558.96 --> 3564.359
wouldn't be any Darkness I mean I'm not

3561.4 --> 3567.88
even the first person to argue this

3564.359 --> 3571.52
argument it's been aru from an academic

3567.88 --> 3571.52
Viewpoint in the 20th

3578.54 --> 3582.5589999999997
[Music]

3580.119 --> 3584.7200000000003
century maybe I'll put this in the title

3582.559 --> 3584.7200000000003
why

3595.039 --> 3600.409
not e

[Applause]

3648.44 --> 3651.44
h

3660.92 --> 3665.88
all right let's put that in the title

3663.319 --> 3665.88
for now let's

3672.55 --> 3675.739
[Music]

3684.92 --> 3687.92
see

3714.839 --> 3717.839
for

3723.78 --> 3726.889
[Music]

3744.839 --> 3748.88
for for

3782.92 --> 3786.84
[Music]

3788.839 --> 3791.839
h

3821.88 --> 3828.1600000000003
I'm expl my explanation what space is is

3825.88 --> 3832.52
technically the most academically strong

3828.16 --> 3836.279
position that what hello rof and St

3832.52 --> 3837.7599999999998
hubbins now I'm merely referencing

3836.279 --> 3840.079
something this is based on the

3837.76 --> 3844.92
presupposition of outer

3840.079 --> 3844.92
space based on the heliocentric claim of

3850.4 --> 3855.48
it

3852.319 --> 3857.4
right my personal position is that the

3855.48 --> 3860.88
stars and all the celestial lights are

3857.4 --> 3860.88
not don't have an origin

3861.64 --> 3866.44
point they're angular manifestations

3868.079 --> 3875.96
only to our eyes does it seem like the

3871.359 --> 3875.96
light comes from An Origin point

3905.599 --> 3913.48
oh right roof and yes

3909.76 --> 3915.279
exactly my well my position doesn't have

3913.48 --> 3918.799
those specific

3915.279 --> 3921.76
flaws because it doesn't have an origin

3918.799 --> 3924.52
point there is no inverse Square law of

3921.76 --> 3927.6400000000003
light to be dealing with because it's a

3924.52 --> 3927.64
non-local holographic

3927.96 --> 3933.4
manifestation there is no

3930.319 --> 3934.64
distance no distance no infer Square law

3933.4 --> 3937.319
of

3934.64 --> 3940.24
light right and infer Square LW light

3937.319 --> 3942.68
will still apply to objects the lamps

3940.24 --> 3942.68
and all

3943.52 --> 3951.079
that but my suggestion is is that the

3946.96 --> 3953.7200000000003
celestial lights are not

3951.079 --> 3956.7200000000003
objects and they don't have origin

3953.72 --> 3956.72
points

3959.44 --> 3963.359
and so yes thank you for recognizing

3961.68 --> 3966.8799999999997
that

3963.359 --> 3970.799
Rufus I actually appreciate that

3966.88 --> 3972.52
yes that that is why I attained that

3970.799 --> 3976.44
position and why I'm kind of holding on

3972.52 --> 3978.119
to it because all the other positions

3976.44 --> 3979.92
basically as soon as you claim from one

3978.119 --> 3982.76
of the celestial lights like yeah it has

3979.92 --> 3986.16
a position

3982.76 --> 3989.4
immediately you just

3986.16 --> 3991.8799999999997
arrive at if you try to then calculate

3989.4 --> 3993.52
and everything you arrive at errors that

3991.88 --> 3996.44
just cannot be

3993.52 --> 3998.839
overcome

3996.44 --> 4002.7200000000003
immediately and even though I cannot

3998.839 --> 4004.72
explain how an angular manifestation can

4002.72 --> 4008.839
be

4004.72 --> 4012.16
made at least if I make some claim with

4008.839 --> 4013.48
it I don't immediately run into

4012.16 --> 4016.1189999999997
mathematical

4013.48 --> 4017.599
errors see

4016.119 --> 4020.119
so

4017.599 --> 4023.0
yeah Celestial lights

4020.119 --> 4024.6800000000003
being non-local holographic angular

4023.0 --> 4028.92
manifestation

4024.68 --> 4031.839
is is basically a more sound position to

4028.92 --> 4035.7200000000003
take academically that's correct I I

4031.839 --> 4039.279
thank you very much for speaking

4035.72 --> 4041.4399999999996
out about that that you recognize that

4039.279 --> 4046.279
that thank

4041.44 --> 4046.279
you thank you for understanding

4048.119 --> 4051.119
h

4084.44 --> 4087.2400000000002
hello ethnic

4091.2 --> 4098.3189999999995
Swan the stars do reach us we can see

4094.359 --> 4098.3189999999995
them yeah but you do you know what that

4101.359 --> 4107.799
is you're saying reaching us that that

4104.759 --> 4111.719
assumes that is a

4107.799 --> 4114.48
distance so could you calculate that

4111.719 --> 4114.4800000000005
what that would be

4115.279 --> 4120.2390000000005
like because you're automatically going

4117.719 --> 4122.799
to bump into this

4120.239 --> 4125.599999999999
issue yeah the issue of the title of

4122.799 --> 4128.56
today's show if stars were bright enough

4125.6 --> 4132.799
to reach us outer space wouldn't be

4128.56 --> 4132.799
dark like ever

4154.319 --> 4160.64
H it's good to have

4156.56 --> 4162.96
a a subject that actually relates to Fe

4160.64 --> 4167.359
to talk about that again makes me feel

4162.96 --> 4167.359
good thank you guys thank you for

4168.199 --> 4173.799
well actually I did bring it up but it's

4170.52 --> 4176.040000000001
good I'm happy about it I brought it up

4173.799 --> 4176.839
like as an example of a short that I

4176.04 --> 4179.92
could

4176.839 --> 4182.839
make we could also just discuss

4179.92 --> 4187.52
it I

4182.839 --> 4190.6
mean this stuff is exactly why I've

4187.52 --> 4191.56
developed everything that I did because

4190.6 --> 4195.64
of

4191.56 --> 4198.360000000001
these insurmountable dilemas with in the

4195.64 --> 4198.360000000001
Helia Centric

4199.8 --> 4204.4400000000005
claims that are effectively being

4204.92 --> 4208.76
ignored right they can't fix it but

4207.36 --> 4212.44
they're not going to

4208.76 --> 4212.4400000000005
change everything

4215.56 --> 4223.84
around right from Stars though stars

4219.719 --> 4223.84
does reach us do reach

4224.04 --> 4231.0
us yeah but I mean reaching is you're

4228.36 --> 4231.0
reaching

4231.159 --> 4238.799999999999
here you're making a

4233.8 --> 4238.8
claim that it is basically going a

4251.199 --> 4259.799999999999
distance right I mean we do see stars

4256.88 --> 4262.92
but as soon as you start to figure out

4259.8 --> 4267.4800000000005
like hey if that is like a really bright

4262.92 --> 4270.6
light bulb that is at insane distances

4267.48 --> 4273.36
away well if it would be bright enough

4270.6 --> 4277.360000000001
to then reach us then it would be bright

4273.36 --> 4277.36
enough to reach everything

4277.96 --> 4283.64
else and it's just not one star it's

4281.36 --> 4286.599999999999
billions of them or however much it's

4283.64 --> 4291.04
supposed to be out there and if they're

4286.6 --> 4293.92
all bright enough to reach us then there

4291.04 --> 4293.92
wouldn't be any

4299.6 --> 4304.88
Darkness B up the mil me the light you

4303.4 --> 4307.719
speak of

4304.88 --> 4310.719
no no everything

4307.719 --> 4310.719
Richard

4314.239 --> 4317.239
everything

4344.159 --> 4348.159
for e

4379.88 --> 4382.88
f

4414.36 --> 4421.12
anyway good to see you regular

4416.56 --> 4421.120000000001
Richard and dangerous Daniel secret

4422.159 --> 4428.0
spaniel please don't forget to Rogan up

4424.52 --> 4428.0
the show and

4439.88 --> 4444.88
and share it of course hey Richard G

4442.48 --> 4444.879999999999
good to see

4452.56 --> 4459.120000000001
you curious what you would say the

4455.04 --> 4459.12
difference between belief and faith

4462.199 --> 4468.12
is well belief would be like

4465.36 --> 4468.12
intellectual

4469.8 --> 4474.679
position no I yeah it's difficult

4478.159 --> 4486.28
one like faith is emphasizing

4482.92 --> 4488.88
trust which is like a more emotional

4486.28 --> 4492.84
position or

4488.88 --> 4495.84
social like faith is accepting something

4492.84 --> 4497.52
without necessary information

4495.84 --> 4501.28
you're just trusting

4497.52 --> 4504.84
it well belief is a

4501.28 --> 4507.36
conviction without having completion of

4504.84 --> 4510.159000000001
the information for

4507.36 --> 4512.5199999999995
example without

4510.159 --> 4515.839999999999
resolve so they're very close to one

4512.52 --> 4519.4800000000005
another except I'd say belief is more on

4515.84 --> 4519.4800000000005
the side of it

4520.92 --> 4527.4800000000005
uh is more a little more intellectual

4524.239 --> 4529.799999999999
than faith which is more about social

4527.48 --> 4532.799999999999
and

4529.8 --> 4532.8
emotional

4533.0 --> 4537.12
stance hope that explains it a

4540.0 --> 4545.52
bit but that's yeah that's a tough

4542.52 --> 4545.52
question

4557.56 --> 4562.4800000000005
I mean some people will probably say

4559.4 --> 4562.48
that they're exactly

4563.8 --> 4570.679
identical so maybe I'm just I'm wrong

4567.92 --> 4570.679
maybe they are

4577.199 --> 4583.919999999999
identical it's just that the word

4580.48 --> 4589.718999999999
faith tends to

4583.92 --> 4592.719
not be open to further development or

4589.719 --> 4597.92
Discovery Well belief is just a

4592.719 --> 4597.92
temporary State based on available

4603.84 --> 4608.12
information hey fiber outs good to see

4613.04 --> 4616.84
you good to have you all in

4619.39 --> 4622.6
[Music]

4642.88 --> 4646.639
here I'm really glad to be doing the

4645.239 --> 4652.159
show by the

4646.639 --> 4652.159000000001
way I'm I'm still kind of

4655.28 --> 4662.639
feeble but like this talking about this

4659.159 --> 4664.4
sort of thing is is really like pull is

4662.639 --> 4667.28
what pulls me

4664.4 --> 4669.5599999999995
through just having a good subject and

4667.28 --> 4672.04
just open discussion with the chat and

4669.56 --> 4675.1990000000005
that's that's how I like it that's what

4672.04 --> 4675.199
I need

4676.48 --> 4681.5599999999995
now I just have to figure out like how

4678.52 --> 4687.360000000001
can I just have a decent night rest and

4681.56 --> 4687.360000000001
not feel weirdly drained in the morning

4706.12 --> 4710.5599999999995
but it might also just be all the Wi-Fi

4711.199 --> 4716.28
activity it might be it might be

4713.52 --> 4719.159000000001
specifically that that is like draining

4716.28 --> 4721.679
me because I'm not used to like being

4719.159 --> 4723.719
tired at this kind of time normally this

4721.679 --> 4725.6
is the time where I'm like really like

4723.719 --> 4727.84
yeah let's do this let's do this I might

4725.6 --> 4731.92
even like start yelling at the chat like

4727.84 --> 4734.4400000000005
why aren't you talking damn it

4731.92 --> 4735.2390000000005
right although you guys are talking

4734.44 --> 4739.04
right now

4735.239 --> 4739.04
so it's all good

4766.88 --> 4775.04
what were you guys talking about earlier

4770.0 --> 4775.04
like the sun well look at the title r

4776.12 --> 4782.719
g it's about the INF Square law of light

4779.679 --> 4785.36
and how that basically in a way ruins

4782.719 --> 4786.76
the entire premise of the heliocentric

4785.36 --> 4791.639
model and the

4786.76 --> 4796.159000000001
claims about all the stars being super

4791.639 --> 4798.36
bright Balls of Fire that eminate light

4796.159 --> 4802.44
that is technically bright enough to

4798.36 --> 4802.44
reach us at the claimed

4806.6 --> 4811.1990000000005
distances if it would be bright enough

4809.08 --> 4813.8
to reach us well then it would be bright

4811.199 --> 4816.44
enough to reach all the other stars and

4813.8 --> 4819.1990000000005
then it would just be everything would

4816.44 --> 4821.159
be completely bathed in super bright

4819.199 --> 4823.759999999999
light

4821.159 --> 4826.159
everything like light adds up if you

4823.76 --> 4829.56
have one light you have another

4826.159 --> 4833.0
light it becomes even more bright

4829.56 --> 4833.0
together did you know

4839.76 --> 4843.8
that right if you have two

4844.96 --> 4854.0
lights together they become more bright

4850.28 --> 4856.04
than a singular light even though the

4854.0 --> 4858.8
lights are EX exactly the same strength

4856.04 --> 4863.04
and brightness that's a

4858.8 --> 4865.52
fact so if they're all out

4863.04 --> 4867.639
there billions of them and they're all

4865.52 --> 4870.280000000001
so strong that they can reach all the

4867.639 --> 4873.0
way here based on the infer Square law

4870.28 --> 4874.36
of light well then outer space wouldn't

4873.0 --> 4878.52
be dark at

4874.36 --> 4881.5599999999995
all it would be continual daylight

4878.52 --> 4883.4800000000005
basically or even brighter than that it

4881.56 --> 4885.4400000000005
might even be so bright we wouldn't even

4883.48 --> 4887.759999999999
see blue

4885.44 --> 4892.599999999999
it would just always be like ah there's

4887.76 --> 4892.6
always light outside just trying to hurt

4892.679 --> 4898.719
us because it's insanely bright out

4895.679 --> 4902.88
there that is

4898.719 --> 4902.88
what what reality would

4903.44 --> 4910.04
yield in heliocentrism and I'm not the

4906.639 --> 4912.159000000001
first one to be saying

4910.04 --> 4916.08
that like that

4912.159 --> 4919.719
was academically no

4916.08 --> 4922.8
noticed like in the 20th

4919.719 --> 4926.36
century it's just kind of like noticed

4922.8 --> 4928.96
and then passed on moved past so that

4926.36 --> 4933.04
people are like because yeah it just

4928.96 --> 4933.04
breaks the whole thing apart

4948.92 --> 4955.6
like how they claim on Flat Earth it

4950.679 --> 4958.36
would always be you would always see it

4955.6 --> 4960.280000000001
right well that because they don't

4958.36 --> 4963.839999999999
understand the logical consequences of

4960.28 --> 4965.12
perspective Etc which is the the discer

4963.84 --> 4968.08
the disc Earth

4965.12 --> 4970.599999999999
argument rebuttal to all

4968.08 --> 4972.679
that like oh you would always see the

4970.6 --> 4977.4800000000005
sun on a flat Earth

4972.679 --> 4977.4800000000005
disc yeah except there still perspective

4982.199 --> 4988.638999999999
though and

4984.76 --> 4991.280000000001
like that sun that would be 3,000 miles

4988.639 --> 4992.36
away would definitely not be as bright

4991.28 --> 4995.04
as the

4992.36 --> 4996.799999999999
heliocentric sun which is further away

4995.04 --> 4999.679
because

4996.8 --> 5003.88
right depending on the distance it would

4999.679 --> 5006.679
have to be bright enough in order to

5003.88 --> 5009.96
it's like distance is like a brightness

5006.679 --> 5009.96
multiplier in

5016.92 --> 5023.92
that so the dis Earth Sun that's

5020.56 --> 5026.360000000001
supposedly 3,000 miles away would be way

5023.92 --> 5030.56
less bright than the heliocentric Sun

5026.36 --> 5030.5599999999995
that's millions of miles away

5035.4 --> 5041.759999999999
are wind debunk outter space again yeah

5039.239 --> 5044.12
I mean I didn't do it it was originally

5041.76 --> 5046.96
some academic that did it like by

5044.12 --> 5049.96
accident it was basically like a Ballwin

5046.96 --> 5052.4
situation I think like the guy wasn't

5049.96 --> 5054.28
like a flat Earth or girl I don't know I

5052.4 --> 5057.5599999999995
don't know exactly who did

5054.28 --> 5059.8
it but it was in the 20th century

5057.56 --> 5062.679
somewhere and the guyy was like hey we

5059.8 --> 5066.6
got a problem like I can't make it

5062.679 --> 5068.96
work why can't I make this work like

5066.6 --> 5071.96
yeah INF for sell of light we got a

5068.96 --> 5074.92
problem like he didn't mean to debunk

5071.96 --> 5077.4800000000005
space it just kind of happened by

5074.92 --> 5082.4800000000005
accident it's just realizing like oh

5077.48 --> 5085.28
wait INF for square of light uh

5082.48 --> 5088.36
oh

5085.28 --> 5091.679
yeah that's going to be a

5088.36 --> 5096.239
problem so let's definitely not mention

5091.679 --> 5101.4
the infer Square law of light in

5096.239 --> 5103.799999999999
early like uh I guess Globe Earth

5101.4 --> 5107.159
physics teaching like let's not talk

5103.8 --> 5107.159000000001
about that in the early

5107.44 --> 5115.44
stages like leave the infer Square love

5110.0 --> 5115.44
light to the real University Physics and

5115.48 --> 5120.5599999999995
to people that are like into Electronics

5118.639 --> 5123.92
like just leave it to them

5120.56 --> 5125.84
right just don't mention it while you're

5123.92 --> 5128.92
trying to explain how the Earth is

5125.84 --> 5131.719
supposedly a ball and the stars are all

5128.92 --> 5134.84
giant Bright Lights very far away just

5131.719 --> 5138.159
don't talk about it

5134.84 --> 5142.119000000001
then cuz it'll be a

5138.159 --> 5143.879999999999
mess like little kids will pick up if

5142.119 --> 5146.28
you just give all the

5143.88 --> 5149.04
information even little kids will pick

5146.28 --> 5152.639
up on that and be like

5149.04 --> 5156.239
uh but now there's a hole there like

5152.639 --> 5156.2390000000005
wouldn't this be like that

5160.04 --> 5166.36
oops right if you give even little kids

5163.92 --> 5170.04
the pre-team if you give them all the

5166.36 --> 5173.719
information honestly then they will

5170.04 --> 5173.719
figure it out

5191.43 --> 5194.6
[Music]

5213.36 --> 5218.08
yeah always be there like it would yeah

5215.88 --> 5218.08
it

5218.6 --> 5226.88
would and it's like we're supposedly

5222.679 --> 5226.88
able to see entire

5227.679 --> 5234.28
galaxies like outside of our own

5230.88 --> 5236.0
Galaxy right that's the

5234.28 --> 5241.159
claim

5236.0 --> 5244.8
well everything would look to that

5241.159 --> 5247.4
brightness and more

5244.8 --> 5250.56
it wouldn't just be like even

5247.4 --> 5253.96
daylight everything would be completely

5250.56 --> 5256.96
blinding bright it would be blinding

5253.96 --> 5256.96
bright at all

5257.08 --> 5260.229
[Music]

5260.32 --> 5267.32
times because all that light all adds up

5264.76 --> 5269.96
with each other right you have two light

5267.32 --> 5272.239
sources just as

5269.96 --> 5274.8
bright

5272.239 --> 5276.36
together next to one another

5274.8 --> 5280.52
they're more

5276.36 --> 5283.599999999999
bright than singular so and now imagine

5280.52 --> 5286.76
that like billions and billions of

5283.6 --> 5289.76
times like it would all add up it's

5286.76 --> 5289.76
crazy

5324.119 --> 5327.119
that's

5328.53 --> 5331.5689999999995
[Music]

5343.35 --> 5347.93
[Music]

5360.86 --> 5364.639
[Music]

5362.32 --> 5366.32
no all right anyway hope you guys are

5364.639 --> 5369.96
enjoying the show don't forget to rogans

5366.32 --> 5369.96
it up and share

5386.28 --> 5392.199
it and yeah despite this now being the

5389.48 --> 5395.718999999999
title of the show we can also move on to

5392.199 --> 5397.678999999999
another subject if you guys like

5395.719 --> 5400.26
don't just have to now talk about this

5397.679 --> 5402.119
for another two

5400.26 --> 5404.88
[Music]

5402.119 --> 5408.119
hours but we

5404.88 --> 5409.4400000000005
could I mean it does really take some

5408.119 --> 5411.5599999999995
getting used

5409.44 --> 5415.119
to

5411.56 --> 5418.56
like to actually connect these

5415.119 --> 5421.759999999999
dots cuz most people just don't think

5418.56 --> 5424.119000000001
about it they don't all put it all

5421.76 --> 5427.360000000001
together and then they don't come to

5424.119 --> 5427.36
this realization about

5430.08 --> 5434.76
it like light is a pretty tricky

5435.56 --> 5443.0
thing right but my suggestion on like

5439.52 --> 5445.92
why everything looks the way it looks is

5443.0 --> 5449.639
relatively a simple solution to

5445.92 --> 5452.84
this incalculable

5449.639 --> 5454.88
insolvable issue of the outer space

5452.84 --> 5458.1990000000005
claim with all the celestial lights

5454.88 --> 5460.28
there and that is like yeah it looks the

5458.199 --> 5462.678999999999
way it looks because it's an angular

5460.28 --> 5464.199
manifestation and it isn't like the infr

5462.679 --> 5467.8
square law of light doesn't apply

5464.199 --> 5470.5199999999995
because there is no Source it's not

5467.8 --> 5473.159000000001
light coming from a distance so it's not

5470.52 --> 5476.6
literally out there being bright enough

5473.159 --> 5476.599999999999
to reach all the way

5479.84 --> 5485.8
here

5481.76 --> 5491.0
it's more likely something like

5485.8 --> 5491.0
a non-local holographic angular

5497.679 --> 5503.56
manifestation that

5499.76 --> 5508.679
like partially lights things

5503.56 --> 5508.679
up locally it just it does it right

5511.44 --> 5519.599999999999
there all that is required is it not

5515.52 --> 5523.76
being blocked from its angular

5519.6 --> 5523.76
manifestation Direction that's

5523.88 --> 5530.32
it light travels pretty quick well

5526.639 --> 5530.32
instantaneously as far as I'm

5535.36 --> 5541.48
concerned so it manifests as far as I'm

5538.6 --> 5546.280000000001
concerned instantaneous like

5541.48 --> 5546.28
any idea about his speed light

5546.679 --> 5553.56
is is debatable highly debatable and not

5550.8 --> 5556.76
really officially at measur I mean there

5553.56 --> 5556.76
is a claim about

5558.239 --> 5564.44
it but even those claims the origins of

5561.639 --> 5568.719
the speed of light claim is based on

5564.44 --> 5572.839999999999
distances to presuppose Celestial light

5568.719 --> 5576.119
distances so even there like there is

5572.84 --> 5579.400000000001
no speed of light that is purely based

5576.119 --> 5581.44
on light that was manmade on earth like

5579.4 --> 5584.32
there is no claim like that that's the

5581.44 --> 5586.36
craziest thing about it so even the

5584.32 --> 5588.159
claim of the speed of light

5586.36 --> 5591.719
is

5588.159 --> 5594.96
within the presupposition based Paradigm

5591.719 --> 5600.199
of the stars or the whatever the sun

5594.96 --> 5600.199
having that presupposed distance

5605.76 --> 5608.979
[Music]

5610.36 --> 5617.96
what where's the DAT will

5613.6 --> 5617.96
be I don't know where did he

5619.719 --> 5622.96
go he's

5623.199 --> 5629.199
been off for a while I think he's having

5626.199 --> 5632.5599999999995
lunch he was like having lunch 50

5629.199 --> 5632.5599999999995
minutes ago

5636.719 --> 5644.08
H scle how do we see

5639.44 --> 5644.08
stars well what are stars for us to

5644.32 --> 5648.92
see when all of yeah when you realize

5647.119 --> 5653.08
all of this is based on

5648.92 --> 5653.08
assumptions yes it does blow your

5656.679 --> 5663.719
mind right because even when you realize

5660.119 --> 5667.159
that you then realize that there is a g

5663.719 --> 5670.84
gantic mystery left

5667.159 --> 5674.119
instead like you're still seeing stuff

5670.84 --> 5677.92
but now you just can't properly explain

5674.119 --> 5677.92
how how you see that

5681.679 --> 5688.159
stuff and I've attempted it I've

5684.119 --> 5691.44
attempted to do that to in a way that

5688.159 --> 5693.719
resolves these issues by saying yeah I

5691.44 --> 5696.759999999999
think Celestial lights are non-local

5693.719 --> 5696.76
holographic angular

5697.04 --> 5702.639
manifestations so they don't travel any

5699.719 --> 5705.719
actual distance there is no distance

5702.639 --> 5705.719
between a light

5705.84 --> 5714.1990000000005
source and it arriving

5710.119 --> 5714.199
here it's an angular

5721.6 --> 5729.679
manifestation assumption makes

5725.119 --> 5729.679
an assumption out of you and I

5737.639 --> 5742.28
this I know what you were trying

5757.28 --> 5761.199
what exactly is an angular

5761.679 --> 5766.28
manifestation it's

5764.76 --> 5768.76
light

5766.28 --> 5773.199
arriving from an

5768.76 --> 5773.1990000000005
angle without originating from a

5777.679 --> 5782.159
source but it can still be blocked

5780.679 --> 5785.56
that's the weirdest thing it can be

5782.159 --> 5785.5599999999995
blocked but not because

5785.679 --> 5789.719
it's blocking off a

5791.6 --> 5798.639
source it's just blocking off the angle

5795.04 --> 5798.639
the angular

5798.8 --> 5804.159000000001
origin Google doesn't

5801.84 --> 5806.719
know yeah because an angular

5804.159 --> 5809.4
manifestation is basically a word that I

5806.719 --> 5813.84
had to personally

5809.4 --> 5816.44
invent to try to describe it yeah I've I

5813.84 --> 5819.88
had to

5816.44 --> 5822.919999999999
like thread new grounds of understanding

5819.88 --> 5826.96
and explanation in order to give you

5822.92 --> 5828.76
anything about it other than hey I can't

5826.96 --> 5831.199
make it work it doesn't work nothing

5828.76 --> 5834.639
about it works that's

5831.199 --> 5838.04
it I attempted

5834.639 --> 5840.679
something and that attempt is non-local

5838.04 --> 5842.88
holographic angular

5840.679 --> 5844.679
manifestation and I know that I'll have

5842.88 --> 5847.2390000000005
to be

5844.679 --> 5849.56
explaining it many times to many people

5847.239 --> 5852.28
because it'll be like what what what I

5849.56 --> 5854.2390000000005
get it I totally get it don't worry if

5852.28 --> 5859.0
you don't get

5854.239 --> 5859.0
it I mean sometimes it gives me a

5860.32 --> 5867.92
headache I should share this with the

5863.36 --> 5871.0
world what do you think my shows are

5867.92 --> 5873.639
scle that's what I'm doing here it's

5871.0 --> 5876.8
it's what I do

5873.639 --> 5876.8
that's why I do my

5877.48 --> 5884.638999999999
shows other than also just have a bit of

5881.88 --> 5887.36
a social interaction and some slight

5884.639 --> 5889.639
ebegging just to be able to get around

5887.36 --> 5893.48
but I mean these are this

5889.639 --> 5896.04
is the main reason why I've been doing

5893.48 --> 5900.04
my shows for

5896.04 --> 5900.04
1922 times

5906.719 --> 5912.679
right but I am open about it I mean

5909.32 --> 5917.159
let's just say somebody at a university

5912.679 --> 5919.719
or something had had the balls to invite

5917.159 --> 5923.04
a flat earther

5919.719 --> 5925.36
over and they pick up on this and they

5923.04 --> 5927.599
want me to personally talk to them in a

5925.36 --> 5930.48
face tof face

5927.599 --> 5933.08
situation about it about this

5930.48 --> 5935.44
complication I would be willing to do

5933.08 --> 5935.44
that

5936.8 --> 5943.679
right under the premise that I'll be

5940.599 --> 5946.32
taken serious like you're not just going

5943.679 --> 5949.0
to like mock me because I'm a flat

5946.32 --> 5951.04
earther CU then if that's the case

5949.0 --> 5952.56
you'll just have to saddle for watching

5951.04 --> 5955.56
my streams then to attain the

5952.56 --> 5955.56
information

5963.76 --> 5971.0
29 people is quite a small number out of

5966.76 --> 5971.0
8 billion yeah it doesn't really

5973.36 --> 5979.96
matter the point is is that the ideas go

5977.28 --> 5983.199
out and then through other people it

5979.96 --> 5985.56
moves on like people talk about what's

5983.199 --> 5987.799999999999
on their mind to other people that

5985.56 --> 5990.04
they're used to talking to and then it

5987.8 --> 5992.96
spreads

5990.04 --> 5996.92
around and now What's Happening Here is

5992.96 --> 5999.719
I'm reminding people right the title

5996.92 --> 6002.4400000000005
it's not necessarily about oh angular

5999.719 --> 6005.32
holographic manifestation no it's about

6002.44 --> 6007.638999999999
hey do you

6005.32 --> 6009.88
remember if the stars were bright enough

6007.639 --> 6011.84
to reach us outer space wouldn't be dark

6009.88 --> 6014.32
right do you remember that there's like

6011.84 --> 6016.1990000000005
an academic notification about that

6014.32 --> 6020.719
probably you might have bumped into this

6016.199 --> 6024.638999999999
during your study like yeah that thing

6020.719 --> 6028.639
remains i r win

6024.639 --> 6028.639
have actually addressed

6029.199 --> 6038.4
this I don't know a single individual in

6034.4 --> 6042.96
the world other than myself that has

6038.4 --> 6046.36
actually attempted to address this issue

6042.96 --> 6047.92
ever I've never heard anybody ever

6046.36 --> 6051.598999999999
address this

6047.92 --> 6055.2390000000005
issue attempting a

6051.599 --> 6055.2390000000005
solution I'm attempting

6065.04 --> 6072.5199999999995
right and people should be picking up on

6068.599 --> 6075.119000000001
that I mean information spreads it just

6072.52 --> 6078.119000000001
does and if I'm like the only source

6075.119 --> 6080.5599999999995
that's even addressing this like through

6078.119 --> 6081.679
my show through people bumping into me

6080.56 --> 6084.679
through

6081.679 --> 6088.119
gossip the idea will spread around and

6084.679 --> 6088.119
people will take notice of

6110.08 --> 6118.119
it it's kind of funny though to just get

6114.28 --> 6120.04
to get a bit personal here

6118.119 --> 6122.04
sorry I've been

6120.04 --> 6124.96
feeling

6122.04 --> 6129.44
bad like in the last

6124.96 --> 6132.159
week but for a while it's not just the

6129.44 --> 6134.879999999999
last it's probably

6132.159 --> 6137.5599999999995
been a couple of

6134.88 --> 6141.96
years it's slowly building

6137.56 --> 6144.2390000000005
up but this right here this

6141.96 --> 6146.44
realization that I'm the only one that's

6144.239 --> 6149.4
actually addressing

6146.44 --> 6151.159
this this is like one of the reasons I'm

6149.4 --> 6153.598999999999
still

6151.159 --> 6156.839999999999
around that

6153.599 --> 6157.92
I that I feel that I might actually have

6156.84 --> 6162.360000000001
a

6157.92 --> 6165.0
really prominent role in this world that

6162.36 --> 6166.92
I can do this this is like a

6165.0 --> 6169.56
justification for my

6166.92 --> 6173.1990000000005
existence and I'm

6169.56 --> 6176.2390000000005
not I'm not trying to manipulate any

6173.199 --> 6176.239
anything it's it

6176.48 --> 6182.598999999999
is is that I can do

6179.44 --> 6185.48
this but I mean my life

6182.599 --> 6188.719
is is a

6185.48 --> 6191.678999999999
mess it is a mess I mean it could be

6188.719 --> 6194.88
worse I'm still really doing my best to

6191.679 --> 6196.32
keep everything as orderly as I can but

6194.88 --> 6200.1990000000005
I am

6196.32 --> 6202.159
overall on a regular basis unfortunately

6200.199 --> 6205.119
on a regular basis I'm kind of an

6202.159 --> 6205.119
emotional wreck

6205.56 --> 6209.679
and then I feel like why am I still here

6207.88 --> 6213.4400000000005
why am I still here in this world you

6209.679 --> 6216.84
know but this is one of those reasons

6213.44 --> 6220.678999999999
it's like I I can actually

6216.84 --> 6224.76
address complicated things that

6220.679 --> 6229.84
literally nobody else in the

6224.76 --> 6233.320000000001
world does and maybe can't like I can do

6229.84 --> 6234.4800000000005
this and this is like a really

6233.32 --> 6237.5199999999995
I

6234.48 --> 6240.44
wish it would be picked up on and I

6237.52 --> 6242.280000000001
could really like put myself down with

6240.44 --> 6246.48
this kind of

6242.28 --> 6249.84
thing and that people would like back me

6246.48 --> 6249.839999999999
up in

6251.8 --> 6255.8
this what

6305.96 --> 6308.96
m

6338.56 --> 6344.280000000001
all right but I mean thank you all for

6341.679 --> 6347.84
helping me to remind myself like I do

6344.28 --> 6347.84
definitely have to hold on

6348.119 --> 6353.28
because I can help figure this out

6362.32 --> 6367.239
should be the king of the whole world

6364.52 --> 6367.2390000000005
what are you talking

6369.04 --> 6374.32
about that's a strange thing to say

6404.28 --> 6407.28
scientist

6410.88 --> 6418.92
maybe I mean the sounds nice it's just

6414.719 --> 6421.56
like I just address things that are not

6418.92 --> 6423.56
really typically addressed where people

6421.56 --> 6426.2390000000005
just kind of like drop it and try to

6423.56 --> 6427.4800000000005
find something that they can grasp or

6426.239 --> 6431.28
work

6427.48 --> 6434.759999999999
on and I just try to find that way

6431.28 --> 6437.599
through where nobody looks and that's

6434.76 --> 6440.320000000001
what I've done with this as well and

6437.599 --> 6442.360000000001
that is how I came to the non-local

6440.32 --> 6444.84
holographic angular manifestations

6442.36 --> 6444.839999999999
explanation

6456.4 --> 6458.799999999999
oh hold

6471.84 --> 6474.84
on

6501.76 --> 6505.76
e e

6561.719 --> 6565.679
youo for

6615.4 --> 6618.598999999999
hold on

6641.56 --> 6646.88
anyway yeah I really appreciate being

6643.8 --> 6651.320000000001
able to talk about this subject with you

6646.88 --> 6651.32
guys hope you find it interesting

6658.0 --> 6661.36
don't forget to Rogan it

6663.04 --> 6667.56
up hey debatable D welcome

6671.28 --> 6674.33
[Music]

6677.159 --> 6682.5199999999995
back on the train okay

6684.88 --> 6689.4400000000005
right I got to take a two-minute break

6686.84 --> 6689.4400000000005
I'll be right

6711.52 --> 6714.52
back

6741.52 --> 6744.52
e

6771.44 --> 6774.44
e

6801.44 --> 6805.48
e e

6859.96 --> 6864.36
yo oh

6891.32 --> 6894.32
e

6921.32 --> 6924.32
e

6951.239 --> 6954.239
e

6981.239 --> 6984.239
e

7011.239 --> 7015.199
e e

7061.88 --> 7066.88
all

7063.0 --> 7068.48
right so yeah guys uh I'm afraid that I

7066.88 --> 7071.400000000001
I can't

7068.48 --> 7073.159
like uh continue the show for too much

7071.4 --> 7074.96
longer

7073.159 --> 7076.239
it's like both my roommates actually

7074.96 --> 7078.679
need the

7076.239 --> 7081.119
WiFi and there's something weird going

7078.679 --> 7083.96
on with the

7081.119 --> 7086.199
device like not sending out for some

7083.96 --> 7089.719
reason and I have to like probably

7086.199 --> 7089.719
unplug it

7111.159 --> 7118.36
right so I hope you're you've all

7114.159 --> 7118.36
enjoyed the show thus far

7161.04 --> 7165.56
thus far it has been great great

7163.52 --> 7167.639
thanks yeah no it's been very

7165.56 --> 7170.56
interesting I I wish that I could like

7167.639 --> 7170.56
just keep going and

7177.0 --> 7182.96
going but I'm afraid I'm going to have

7179.36 --> 7185.5199999999995
to probably round it out soon and get

7182.96 --> 7189.92
this thing working again it's very odd

7185.52 --> 7189.92
that it's like doing this

7199.28 --> 7204.84
I could just like try to plug and unplug

7201.56 --> 7208.280000000001
it but it could be that like the stream

7204.84 --> 7208.28
then just ends

7254.079 --> 7259.5199999999995
yeah debatable D I know it could be it

7256.96 --> 7262.84
could be any of those but like I'm going

7259.52 --> 7265.0
to have to probably just disconnect and

7262.84 --> 7267.4400000000005
that means like my live stream is

7265.0 --> 7270.92
probably going to be interrupted anyway

7267.44 --> 7273.719
so I'm going to actually round out the

7270.92 --> 7276.04
show just really too bad because it's

7273.719 --> 7276.04
been

7277.719 --> 7282.199
great if you

7279.679 --> 7283.56
unplug and plug in quick enough enough

7282.199 --> 7287.159
it might be

7283.56 --> 7287.159000000001
fine it might

7287.96 --> 7292.159
be I guess I could try

7297.119 --> 7301.92
that all

7299.239 --> 7304.879999999999
right but I mean yeah that could mean

7301.92 --> 7306.96
that there's just no outro to the

7304.88 --> 7310.679
show

7306.96 --> 7312.719
so yeah if uh if if the stream gets cut

7310.679 --> 7315.079
off then thanks everyone for coming I

7312.719 --> 7317.52
hope you appreciate this show I've

7315.079 --> 7319.5199999999995
certainly appreciated if you did then

7317.52 --> 7321.360000000001
again don't forget to Rogan it up and if

7319.52 --> 7323.719
you haven't already subscribe to my

7321.36 --> 7325.32
channel hit the Bell notification so you

7323.719 --> 7328.159
know when I'm going live which is

7325.32 --> 7330.36
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time every day

7328.159 --> 7332.28
and please also do support me through

7330.36 --> 7333.92
the PayPal and the patreon that'll be

7332.28 --> 7336.04
much appreciated and you can always use

7333.92 --> 7337.639
the support so please keep it coming

7336.04 --> 7341.639
that would be

7337.639 --> 7341.639
great uh

7345.48 --> 7348.799999999999
yeah I can't wait until it's properly

7347.079 --> 7353.5599999999995
running again I

7348.8 --> 7356.28
know right so yeah here goes nothing

7353.56 --> 7358.599
maybe uh maybe the show will go on maybe

7356.28 --> 7362.32
it won't

7358.599 --> 7364.28
so see you on the other side and have a

7362.32 --> 7369.44
great

7364.28 --> 7372.599
day it's my internet getting fixed 1 of

7369.44 --> 7375.678999999999
May guess yeah so anyway thanks for

7372.599 --> 7379.360000000001
being here and a great conversation and

7375.679 --> 7382.1990000000005
yeah maybe I'll I'll the stream can

7379.36 --> 7383.679
continue and otherwise I'll see you guys

7382.199 --> 7386.48
tomorrow

7383.679 --> 7390.4
hopefully so yeah until the next video

7386.48 --> 7393.839999999999
keep it flat or see you right after

7390.4 --> 7393.839999999999
this see you

7398.599 --> 7403.32
guys hey is it still going

7425.04 --> 7431.239
huh that's really weird though why is

7427.52 --> 7431.2390000000005
the Wi-Fi off

7455.36 --> 7458.839999999999
don't get it

7467.079 --> 7471.44
I'm afraid I may need to just round it

7469.0 --> 7472.52
out anyway let's see if I can get this

7471.44 --> 7475.759999999999
to

7472.52 --> 7475.76
work I'm

7476.719 --> 7483.0
sorry someone was working on the cable

7480.159 --> 7485.28
no it's because the device itself isn't

7483.0 --> 7487.48
sending out a Wi-Fi signal for some

7485.28 --> 7490.759999999999
reason and I can't figure out why it's

7487.48 --> 7490.759999999999
very strange

7493.76 --> 7499.159000000001
right so yeah I'm going to play the

7496.8 --> 7503.1990000000005
outro

7499.159 --> 7505.598999999999
and maybe see you on the other

7503.199 --> 7508.32
side and otherwise I'll see you guys

7505.599 --> 7510.360000000001
tomorrow so thanks for being with it

7508.32 --> 7511.92
with the show and hope you really

7510.36 --> 7516.598999999999
enjoyed
