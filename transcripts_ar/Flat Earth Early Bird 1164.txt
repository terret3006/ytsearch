anyway

94.24 --> 97.52
weather

95.84 --> 99.68
it's kind of different

97.52 --> 100.64
the wind is

99.68 --> 103.60000000000001
gone

100.64 --> 103.6
down in strength

103.84 --> 108.72
it's now more of a gray soup up there

111.6 --> 114.479
and yeah

113.119 --> 116.88
seems like

114.479 --> 118.24
the rain has halted for a while the

116.88 --> 120.15899999999999
puddles are

118.24 --> 122.399
receding

120.159 --> 122.399
so

124.56 --> 127.52
yeah

125.68 --> 129.84
we'll see what the rest of the day

127.52 --> 129.84
brings

130.479 --> 136.08
huh

132.319 --> 138.879
yeah with the lack of storm i actually

136.08 --> 140.959
kind of slept a little late

138.879 --> 143.28
until half hour before the show should

140.959 --> 145.52
start so

143.28 --> 148.56
i guess it was because of just the lack

145.52 --> 149.68
of storm around me that

148.56 --> 151.28
i kind of

149.68 --> 154.239
in the morning

151.28 --> 157.44
just felt like uh

154.239 --> 159.76
just just a few more hours

157.44 --> 159.76
yeah

159.84 --> 165.20000000000002
anyway i'm here hello america silver

162.239 --> 167.20000000000002
patriot first in chat clutch kevlar

165.2 --> 169.35999999999999
matthew hall m

167.2 --> 174.04
good to see you all

169.36 --> 178.31900000000002
it is tuesday the 22nd of february

174.04 --> 178.319
2022. it's a lot of twos

178.64 --> 181.35999999999999
seven of them

182.64 --> 185.64
right

188.959 --> 194.84
so

190.0 --> 194.84
just doing a bit of a waking up phase

200.4 --> 203.36
i was owen what

203.68 --> 210.15900000000002
i was watching owen benjamin

207.36 --> 213.72000000000003
before this from yesterday didn't get

210.159 --> 213.72
too far though

215.76 --> 222.72
seems to keep focusing on like

219.2 --> 225.2
the situation in canada a lot and

222.72 --> 227.92
like bringing into focus what what is

225.2 --> 230.879
actually happening

227.92 --> 230.879
it's very weird

232.08 --> 237.43900000000002
and certainly how he approaches makes me

235.04 --> 239.12
think about it carefully

237.439 --> 243.439
because i did have that

239.12 --> 243.439
just this weird off feeling about it

245.28 --> 249.2
i had that as well at the start

250.319 --> 252.64
right

253.439 --> 259.199
anyway i'm up for talking about pretty

255.439 --> 259.199
much whatever you guys like

266.479 --> 269.84
uh

267.36 --> 271.28000000000003
i was able to stock up on some fish oil

269.84 --> 272.15999999999997
yesterday

271.28 --> 274.23999999999995
which

272.16 --> 276.47900000000004
i never had run out so

274.24 --> 278.8
very glad i was able to stock that up

276.479 --> 278.8
again

281.6 --> 284.16
let's see

287.04 --> 289.52000000000004
oh yeah

290.16 --> 294.56
i've watched

291.68 --> 297.52
life of brian again

294.56 --> 299.6
i i did kind of start watching that in

297.52 --> 301.919
two days ago even but

299.6 --> 304.32000000000005
yeah i finished what it's such a great

301.919 --> 304.32
movie

305.84 --> 310.88
it's yeah

308.4 --> 313.52
it is like a timeless thing

310.88 --> 316.8
and there's so many details in there

313.52 --> 318.79999999999995
it's it's really mind-boggling

316.8 --> 320.24
there's such

318.8 --> 322.24
careful

320.24 --> 324.56
psychological

322.24 --> 327.68
and societal criticism in that movie

324.56 --> 330.479
that's just unparalleled

327.68 --> 332.72
and it's all it's that british humor

330.479 --> 332.71999999999997
thing

333.039 --> 337.759
but it's so

334.56 --> 339.12
information rich it's so detailed

337.759 --> 341.44
really

339.12 --> 344.0
and it but it's it could just be funny

341.44 --> 345.199
but it's also very smart criticism every

344.0 --> 346.88
part of it

345.199 --> 348.32
it really is

346.88 --> 353.15999999999997
anyway

348.32 --> 353.15999999999997
i enjoyed that watching that again

359.84 --> 362.31899999999996
what else

363.6 --> 367.12
oh yeah

364.639 --> 370.40000000000003
lots of hype

367.12 --> 370.4
about ukraine too

370.56 --> 373.919
or putin apparently

375.44 --> 378.16
basically

376.56 --> 380.8
declared

378.16 --> 383.84000000000003
separate certain provinces and has now

380.8 --> 387.28000000000003
vowed to protect them so it's like

383.84 --> 387.28
yeah it's pretty tense

389.36 --> 393.84000000000003
and in canada yesterday night i thought

391.919 --> 396.24
that there was something good happening

393.84 --> 400.31899999999996
but then

396.24 --> 400.319
i got other pieces of information

405.919 --> 409.919
that apparently this

407.68 --> 411.919
martial law type

409.919 --> 414.15999999999997
legislation that they had signed i

411.919 --> 416.71999999999997
thought that they that it

414.16 --> 419.03900000000004
was refuted or something but i'm not

416.72 --> 419.03900000000004
sure

421.28 --> 426.4
there's articles saying that it was

422.8 --> 429.12
basically signed and it's now

426.4 --> 429.12
engaged

431.44 --> 434.919
hey mike sidnich

438.8 --> 442.759
how's the weather over there

448.57 --> 451.67
[Music]

461.039 --> 464.36
i gotta get

464.479 --> 469.12
some tumeric drink back

467.28 --> 471.19899999999996
except like

469.12 --> 474.16
going like going on my bicycle through

471.199 --> 476.24
the storm has kind of given me

474.16 --> 478.72
a lot of workout to do

476.24 --> 480.96000000000004
and i'm feeling it

478.72 --> 480.96000000000004
ah

482.0 --> 487.12
although i did dry up pretty quick

484.24 --> 487.12
yesterday so

489.199 --> 492.52000000000004
but uh

495.039 --> 502.52
yeah i'm gonna look

497.039 --> 502.52
i got some in my fridge be right back

541.36 --> 544.399
well seems not

547.6 --> 549.839
so

550.32 --> 554.399
i think i might get that

552.399 --> 557.04
later this afternoon when i go for

554.399 --> 557.04
groceries

559.2 --> 563.48
freezing rain coming oh

566.24 --> 571.279
warm day 40.

567.92 --> 571.279
are you talking in fahrenheit

573.04 --> 578.0
40 would be

574.8 --> 581.04
kind of hot in celsius but anyway

578.0 --> 581.04
probably fahrenheit

586.64 --> 593.36
it's debated for a couple of days i

589.04 --> 593.36
voted in last night yeah apparently

594.48 --> 598.8000000000001
what's my take on the russian and

596.24 --> 601.6800000000001
ukraine stuff

598.8 --> 601.68
oh my god

603.36 --> 607.44
well

605.68 --> 609.519
there's so many people talking about

607.44 --> 611.519
that already

609.519 --> 613.44
i mean i kind of said a thing about it a

611.519 --> 616.16
while ago

613.44 --> 618.72
and that's yeah

616.16 --> 620.88
like this is russia's backyard and it's

618.72 --> 620.88
like

621.6 --> 626.48
it's basically family

623.6 --> 628.0790000000001
ukraine in a way and it's a complicated

626.48 --> 631.72
history and

628.079 --> 631.7199999999999
it's just meddling

635.68 --> 640.0
so yeah russia is kind of tr what i

638.399 --> 642.72
think they're trying to do is just kind

640.0 --> 646.16
of take control

642.72 --> 648.5600000000001
without like destroying everything just

646.16 --> 652.399
to like defeat the opponent because i

648.56 --> 652.399
think that that's what they want mostly

655.839 --> 659.6800000000001
like the ones that are

658.079 --> 664.079
influencing

659.68 --> 665.92
the ukrainian anti-russian groups

664.079 --> 668.0
like they

665.92 --> 670.079
the ones that are actually fueling it

668.0 --> 673.399
like they kind of just want it all to

670.079 --> 673.399
blow up

674.079 --> 682.0
want things to escalate as a distraction

677.519 --> 682.0
from their losing grip on the world

685.92 --> 691.8389999999999
like they need another crisis

689.6 --> 691.839
uh

694.48 --> 697.8000000000001
yes matthew

720.079 --> 725.8389999999999
what what's my

722.0 --> 728.16
military category

725.839 --> 731.839
fight what are you talking about might

728.16 --> 731.8389999999999
get drafted no i won't

734.639 --> 737.6800000000001
that would be insane

739.04 --> 742.399
that there's no

740.8 --> 745.8389999999999
drafting here

742.399 --> 745.839
as far as i i know

778.48 --> 781.48
so

794.639 --> 798.839
okay fight the mirage i have no idea

796.48 --> 802.16
what you're talking about but

798.839 --> 802.1600000000001
that's no

813.36 --> 818.16
it's not

814.399 --> 820.639
that's absolutely ridiculous

818.16 --> 823.199
it is ridiculous if they if they'd

820.639 --> 825.279
actually do that

823.199 --> 826.8
like

825.279 --> 828.72
from europe

826.8 --> 831.8389999999999
like everything would go to trash it's

828.72 --> 833.1990000000001
already teetering right now because of

831.839 --> 835.7600000000001
stupid

833.199 --> 838.3199999999999
lockdowns and

835.76 --> 840.48
v passport [ __ ]

838.32 --> 843.6800000000001
if they actually

840.48 --> 847.6
like pull a graft first of all like it

843.68 --> 847.5999999999999
would absolutely be just

848.0 --> 852.32
yeah people would

849.519 --> 852.32
not do that

852.48 --> 858.72
would be a massive

854.839 --> 861.0400000000001
outrage and if they actually pull it off

858.72 --> 864.1600000000001
it would literally destroy

861.04 --> 865.92
the entire economy like with a very fast

864.16 --> 869.639
downfall crash

865.92 --> 869.639
there's just no way

873.68 --> 879.279
oh people imagining are winning the army

877.279 --> 881.04
oh you got such a

879.279 --> 882.8389999999999
great

881.04 --> 884.399
gamer oriented

882.839 --> 888.0
fantasies

884.399 --> 892.12
is that what you fantasize about jesus

888.0 --> 892.12
play too much computer games

944.32 --> 951.1600000000001
right so anything else anybody hello

947.6 --> 951.16
sleepy town

965.12 --> 972.48
spring coming

967.839 --> 972.48
not yet but yeah it's on its way slowly

973.839 --> 978.0
it's been kind of dreary in the last few

975.68 --> 978.0
days

978.48 --> 982.9200000000001
i'm still off the vitamin d3

985.12 --> 990.839
right just

987.279 --> 990.8389999999999
to test that

1003.759 --> 1007.04
hello andy hold my

1008.839 --> 1013.2790000000001
beer cult of medics okay

1018.639 --> 1023.6
i bet there's a lot of those types of

1022.0 --> 1025.439
like

1023.6 --> 1027.839
documentaries

1025.439 --> 1030.799
out there now made by just

1027.839 --> 1030.799
hundreds of people

1031.039 --> 1035.64
hey julia pavin good to see you

1049.6 --> 1054.48
what spit shoot

1051.679 --> 1054.48
oh my god

1061.36 --> 1068.799
it's a social media platform

1064.88 --> 1072.88
one that i know that still actually

1068.799 --> 1074.799
has a stable owen benjamin channel

1072.88 --> 1077.2800000000002
and more

1074.799 --> 1079.44
there's a lot of like

1077.28 --> 1082.48
people that

1079.44 --> 1084.799
delved into like medical conspiracy have

1082.48 --> 1087.679
been able to just do their thing there

1084.799 --> 1091.08
without getting removed

1087.679 --> 1091.0800000000002
like on youtube

1101.28 --> 1104.28
so

1124.32 --> 1126.6399999999999
hmm

1129.76 --> 1132.61
really you got snow in the night that's

1132.0 --> 1134.16
weird

1132.61 --> 1134.84
[Music]

1134.16 --> 1138.0800000000002
all

1134.84 --> 1140.0
right well that might have happened here

1138.08 --> 1141.76
and there as well at night but it just

1140.0 --> 1144.24
didn't notice

1141.76 --> 1144.24
if it did

1148.48 --> 1152.32
mostly just like rain though

1153.679 --> 1156.0
right

1163.12 --> 1165.84
low wrath

1182.16 --> 1185.16
um

1203.2 --> 1209.3600000000001
really having trouble waking up today

1206.96 --> 1212.159
this was weird too because i have slept

1209.36 --> 1212.1589999999999
pretty long but

1213.36 --> 1215.84
i don't know

1218.48 --> 1223.28
like

1219.44 --> 1225.52
the cycle didn't work very efficiently

1223.28 --> 1227.2
it's weird

1225.52 --> 1230.8799999999999
i didn't go to bed super late or

1227.2 --> 1232.72
anything wasn't super over excited

1230.88 --> 1234.88
and i had some weird moments when i was

1232.72 --> 1237.2
trying to basically meditate to go to

1234.88 --> 1237.2
sleep

1237.36 --> 1242.1999999999998
like weird energy fluctuations

1242.559 --> 1248.039
especially like at my heart chakra i

1244.72 --> 1248.039
don't know why

1248.32 --> 1252.48
it's kind of unnerving when that happens

1250.159 --> 1256.0
and especially because i just can't

1252.48 --> 1256.0
explain why that happens

1256.159 --> 1259.6000000000001
when it happens doesn't thankfully

1257.84 --> 1261.12
doesn't like happen every day or

1259.6 --> 1263.4399999999998
anything

1261.12 --> 1265.36
it's kind of rare

1263.44 --> 1267.28
but it's weird

1265.36 --> 1269.76
and when that happens usually i don't

1267.28 --> 1273.24
really rest all that well

1269.76 --> 1273.24
i don't know why

1284.159 --> 1287.159
so

1303.679 --> 1308.3600000000001
a flatter sage could see you

1332.72 --> 1336.559
what

1333.919 --> 1336.5590000000002
messy hall

1336.88 --> 1341.48
it may be part

1338.48 --> 1341.48
bear

1375.6 --> 1379.0
i hate canada

1422.4 --> 1427.2
by the way

1424.0 --> 1427.2
shouting sucks

1429.44 --> 1433.52
i still have like

1431.52 --> 1435.52
i still feel it on

1433.52 --> 1437.36
on my vocal cords that i did that

1435.52 --> 1439.84
yesterday

1437.36 --> 1441.84
you can still feel it

1439.84 --> 1444.1589999999999
it's just not good

1441.84 --> 1447.9599999999998
i mean it's a relief in the moment but

1444.159 --> 1447.96
it like does damage

1472.0 --> 1475.84
fight mirage do you have anything

1476.24 --> 1481.48
interesting to talk about just being

1478.48 --> 1481.48
weird

1496.08 --> 1503.76
did i go crazy yesterday or something no

1500.08 --> 1503.76
it was before my show then

1504.559 --> 1509.84
i even explained it on my show at the

1506.64 --> 1513.6000000000001
beginning it's just that

1509.84 --> 1515.6789999999999
i was going out in pretty rowdy weather

1513.6 --> 1518.0
and then it it kind of turned out to be

1515.679 --> 1520.64
a little drier than i expected at first

1518.0 --> 1523.2
when i went back and then like i was

1520.64 --> 1526.0
literally praying like please whatever

1523.2 --> 1528.159
you do don't have like a giant rainstorm

1526.0 --> 1529.12
[ __ ] thing the last five minutes so i'm

1528.159 --> 1531.0390000000002
soaked

1529.12 --> 1532.9599999999998
and guess what happened that's exactly

1531.039 --> 1535.96
what happened and i got really pissed

1532.96 --> 1535.96
off

1542.08 --> 1545.36
so yeah that happened

1547.52 --> 1553.2
but not on my show it was just me on my

1550.32 --> 1557.559
bicycle outside in the storm

1553.2 --> 1557.559
where nobody could really hear it

1563.039 --> 1567.52
no i'm not doing that on my show i'm

1565.6 --> 1570.8799999999999
trying to specifically not do it it's

1567.52 --> 1574.0
also a combined test with not taking

1570.88 --> 1577.1200000000001
vitamin d3 because my healer some time

1574.0 --> 1580.08
ago said through his studies which i

1577.12 --> 1582.32
very much trust because it's a long long

1580.08 --> 1582.32
one

1582.84 --> 1588.559
that like d3 and all that

1586.4 --> 1590.5590000000002
it's really great when you got a problem

1588.559 --> 1593.76
it's almost like an antidepressant right

1590.559 --> 1593.76
you gotta wean off it

1593.84 --> 1598.3999999999999
because well

1595.679 --> 1600.24
it can actually just like be disruptive

1598.4 --> 1601.76
and

1600.24 --> 1604.96
i felt like

1601.76 --> 1608.96
it might have become it might been

1604.96 --> 1608.96
have been causing more aggression

1609.279 --> 1614.159
me having a lower threshold in getting

1611.76 --> 1615.44
like really aggressive even on the show

1614.159 --> 1616.88
so i

1615.44 --> 1618.88
i tried to

1616.88 --> 1621.5200000000002
or basically decided not to take it

1618.88 --> 1623.679
anymore for a while

1621.52 --> 1626.32
for almost a week now

1623.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
and yeah the results were kind of

1626.32 --> 1630.3999999999999
immediate

1627.84 --> 1633.4399999999998
because i haven't really been savagely

1630.4 --> 1633.44
pissed off since

1635.44 --> 1641.039
except for yesterday outside in the

1637.279 --> 1645.039
weather because like yeah because it was

1641.039 --> 1645.039
super annoying and nobody could hear me

1653.039 --> 1656.32
hello kevlar by the way

1659.679 --> 1664.64
right but yeah sometimes i have to share

1662.399 --> 1666.6399999999999
my pain too

1664.64 --> 1669.64
i prefer to do it when nobody can hear

1666.64 --> 1669.64
it

1675.44 --> 1680.159
unlike a whole category of people that

1677.76 --> 1683.84
like to share their pain as much in your

1680.159 --> 1683.8400000000001
face as they can

1695.52 --> 1701.2
i hope d3 isn't a hoax drug

1698.559 --> 1701.2
you take it

1702.48 --> 1705.44
well

1703.44 --> 1706.72
this is what my healer explained about

1705.44 --> 1708.559
it

1706.72 --> 1710.88
that is that

1708.559 --> 1712.1589999999999
the body has natural mechanisms to start

1710.88 --> 1714.3990000000001
building it up

1712.159 --> 1714.3990000000001
it's

1715.2 --> 1718.0
like at some point

1716.88 --> 1720.24
you kind of

1718.0 --> 1720.24
yeah

1722.0 --> 1726.48
like

1722.96 --> 1728.88
if you're in a bad position physically

1726.48 --> 1730.88
you're in unhealthy habits like you sit

1728.88 --> 1733.1200000000001
inside a lot

1730.88 --> 1735.44
you don't have you don't take the time

1733.12 --> 1737.1999999999998
to go outside take a walk outside with

1735.44 --> 1740.24
the sun and all that

1737.2 --> 1742.96
right and then taking d3 can really

1740.24 --> 1742.96
restore you

1743.12 --> 1747.76
right but

1745.039 --> 1750.32
if you then kind of transition

1747.76 --> 1753.039
because it restores you and

1750.32 --> 1754.559
set up your life smarter wiser with more

1753.039 --> 1757.2
oversight

1754.559 --> 1760.32
then if you just keep taking it

1757.2 --> 1760.32
it can kind of like

1761.44 --> 1766.72
make you lash out i guess

1763.76 --> 1769.36
that's the effect that i've noticed

1766.72 --> 1770.64
is that you become more easily agitated

1769.36 --> 1773.36
it's weird

1770.64 --> 1773.3600000000001
like yeah

1774.399 --> 1778.399
i always thought that that's just me

1779.679 --> 1783.919
that i was like getting more impatient

1781.84 --> 1786.24
throughout my life

1783.919 --> 1788.96
i just couldn't handle it anymore

1786.24 --> 1793.88
but maybe it is the d3 because it's just

1788.96 --> 1793.88
not that low a threshold anymore

1799.039 --> 1803.6
the hulk was exposed to gamma rays

1802.08 --> 1806.799
right

1803.6 --> 1806.799
well yeah dude

1806.88 --> 1812.0800000000002
if you're exposed to gammas you are

1809.919 --> 1814.5590000000002
eventually going to turn into a hulk one

1812.08 --> 1816.8799999999999
way or another

1814.559 --> 1818.8799999999999
you know that

1816.88 --> 1820.24
like nobody can just

1818.88 --> 1822.48
keep their cool

1820.24 --> 1825.279
in the face of gammas

1822.48 --> 1825.279
for too long

1826.48 --> 1833.159
if you can't escape that is you can't

1828.559 --> 1833.1589999999999
just like kick it out or go away

1838.96 --> 1844.72
deadly amounts d3 in the liver that's

1841.6 --> 1844.7199999999998
interesting can a bear

1847.2 --> 1850.3990000000001
right but

1848.96 --> 1853.2
what i think that my healer was trying

1850.399 --> 1857.84
to explain about it mostly is that

1853.2 --> 1859.8400000000001
your body has a regulatory system for it

1857.84 --> 1863.1999999999998
and that you kind of need to pick up on

1859.84 --> 1866.0
that natural building system or it will

1863.2 --> 1867.519
turn disruptive

1866.0 --> 1869.919
it will be

1867.519 --> 1872.559
like taking it constantly would be like

1869.919 --> 1875.8400000000001
taking unnecessary drugs and that's

1872.559 --> 1879.6399999999999
something that body just

1875.84 --> 1879.6399999999999
there will be side effects

1882.24 --> 1886.159
how he actually said it is that it

1886.799 --> 1892.8799999999999
it our mars the spirit

1890.64 --> 1894.3200000000002
right but that's not a good it hardens

1892.88 --> 1897.2
the spirit that's kind of how he

1894.32 --> 1900.799
described it yes very weird to hear it

1897.2 --> 1903.76
being said like that but i understood it

1900.799 --> 1903.76
it kind of just like

1903.84 --> 1909.76
puts you typically in a more defensive

1906.559 --> 1909.76
spiritual posture

1910.0 --> 1915.039
that's what it does that's what he said

1912.08 --> 1917.1999999999998
and yeah that made perfect sense

1915.039 --> 1919.12
like it wasn't even the subject or

1917.2 --> 1920.48
anything he just brought that up and i

1919.12 --> 1921.6789999999999
was like

1920.48 --> 1924.08
whoa

1921.679 --> 1926.64
that would fit a whole bunch of

1924.08 --> 1926.6399999999999
symptoms

1926.799 --> 1931.12
like even the way he described it is

1928.799 --> 1934.32
like yeah that's kind of how i've been

1931.12 --> 1936.4799999999998
describing certain sensations

1934.32 --> 1939.6899999999998
so

1936.48 --> 1942.24
vitamin d3 deficiency causes aggression

1939.69 --> 1943.8400000000001
[Music]

1942.24 --> 1946.799
no

1943.84 --> 1950.9599999999998
no border yeah oh it sounds like it

1946.799 --> 1953.36
doesn't it isn't that just interesting

1950.96 --> 1953.3600000000001
yeah

1953.76 --> 1959.84
well i had been taking it in like more

1957.2 --> 1961.039
than you need dosages

1959.84 --> 1963.6
border boy

1961.039 --> 1966.48
that's the whole point

1963.6 --> 1968.8799999999999
uh i was kind of aggressive well

1966.48 --> 1971.6
intolerant i'm out of principle i'm

1968.88 --> 1974.5590000000002
principally intolerant

1971.6 --> 1977.9189999999999
short temper yeah sometimes

1974.559 --> 1979.9189999999999
oh d3 helps against that

1977.919 --> 1981.919
well i bet that if you're like locked in

1979.919 --> 1983.76
a dungeon or in a basement for like

1981.919 --> 1985.76
months on end or you're like stationed

1983.76 --> 1987.919
at the south pole

1985.76 --> 1989.519
during the winter season

1987.919 --> 1992.3990000000001
yeah

1989.519 --> 1994.48
you're probably gonna be very cranky and

1992.399 --> 1996.4799999999998
d3 would be vital

1994.48 --> 1997.6
because there's no natural way to attain

1996.48 --> 1999.039
it

1997.6 --> 2000.6399999999999
right

1999.039 --> 2003.36
but

2000.64 --> 2006.0
it does also make sense to me that if

2003.36 --> 2007.039
you take it when you don't really need

2006.0 --> 2009.44
it that

2007.039 --> 2011.44
it would actually cause those symptoms

2009.44 --> 2014.3200000000002
because it's tied in with

2011.44 --> 2014.3200000000002
those effects

2016.0 --> 2022.159
right so it's not just oh

2019.36 --> 2024.559
deficiency causes that

2022.159 --> 2027.679
just take it oh yeah but what if you're

2024.559 --> 2027.6789999999999
not really deficient

2028.799 --> 2034.559
right it's a little bit more complicated

2031.279 --> 2037.2
than oh you have symptom buy the product

2034.559 --> 2039.9189999999999
it's not that simple

2037.2 --> 2039.919
not really

2043.76 --> 2049.52
i mean of course it's very preferable

2047.6 --> 2051.679
because it's such an easy system it's

2049.52 --> 2055.28
just cell like oh you got this you have

2051.679 --> 2057.44
these symptoms oh buy it yeah but what

2055.28 --> 2060.44
if it's not caused by that

2057.44 --> 2060.44
right

2061.2 --> 2063.52
um

2064.24 --> 2069.359
is there anything else i'd take that

2066.24 --> 2069.359
good cause aggression

2071.2 --> 2074.6389999999997
no

2073.52 --> 2076.879
not really

2074.639 --> 2076.879
no

2080.879 --> 2086.0
but on the other hand

2082.639 --> 2089.04
i tap into media i watch alex jones now

2086.0 --> 2091.679
watching alex jones can definitely

2089.04 --> 2094.48
at times cause aggression

2091.679 --> 2094.48
absolutely

2094.96 --> 2099.92
it's like he tries to like he's trying

2097.599 --> 2099.92
to like

2100.839 --> 2105.119
right

2102.8 --> 2107.6800000000003
so media

2105.119 --> 2107.6800000000003
for sure

2109.839 --> 2116.359
it winds you up

2112.56 --> 2116.359
a lot of it out there

2119.92 --> 2123.119
and i do follow it

2129.599 --> 2134.4
what is a circle it doesn't oh come on

2134.8 --> 2138.119
sun nitpicky

2144.8 --> 2149.04
hello by the way that flat fellow could

2146.64 --> 2149.04
see you

2154.96 --> 2159.92
what's he up to it's been well now he's

2157.44 --> 2163.2000000000003
all into the trucker thing

2159.92 --> 2166.32
and there's been some

2163.2 --> 2168.7999999999997
well blatantly straightforward obvious

2166.32 --> 2171.04
fear porn situation with russia like oh

2168.8 --> 2172.96
nuclear war he had a whole

2171.04 --> 2175.119
show where it's basically like showing

2172.96 --> 2178.2400000000002
nuclear explosions constantly while

2175.119 --> 2179.52
talking about what would happen if

2178.24 --> 2181.1189999999997
oh

2179.52 --> 2183.52
if russia

2181.119 --> 2185.6800000000003
like it would be a no-no win a win

2183.52 --> 2188.72
situation everything blows it's just

2185.68 --> 2189.9199999999996
yeah pure panic ah we're all gonna die

2188.72 --> 2192.3199999999997
pretty much

2189.92 --> 2194.96
that's yeah that's he still does that

2192.32 --> 2194.96
sometimes

2195.599 --> 2202.76
uh

2197.68 --> 2202.7599999999998
the zoyo puppet ah

2228.079 --> 2231.96
yeah can i bear exactly

2245.359 --> 2250.16
look the tickets are [ __ ] yeah

2247.92 --> 2251.119
okay

2250.16 --> 2253.5989999999997
okay

2251.119 --> 2256.0
good to hear you don't like him

2253.599 --> 2257.76
yeah i don't know what he's done and i'm

2256.0 --> 2260.88
definitely going to keep following what

2257.76 --> 2260.88
he's what he's doing

2262.32 --> 2267.32
because he's like a player on the board

2278.4 --> 2281.04
you'll miss him

2279.76 --> 2284.32
well

2281.04 --> 2288.72
can i bear i haven't had to miss him

2284.32 --> 2288.7200000000003
i've been watching him for decades now

2292.48 --> 2297.28
he has some really

2294.96 --> 2300.48
really annoying moments

2297.28 --> 2300.48
where he is just like

2303.68 --> 2306.3999999999996
just just that

2306.8 --> 2311.3590000000004
that

2308.8 --> 2313.3590000000004
where he's like being such a salesman

2311.359 --> 2315.52
about something

2313.359 --> 2316.72
that it's just like come on

2315.52 --> 2320.32
dude

2316.72 --> 2323.7599999999998
just just stop it just stop it just shut

2320.32 --> 2327.3590000000004
the hell up alex it's so annoying just

2323.76 --> 2329.76
don't do that just don't even try

2327.359 --> 2331.44
to think in your head like that's a good

2329.76 --> 2335.0400000000004
thing to do ever

2331.44 --> 2336.48
just never do that never

2335.04 --> 2337.2
just stop it

2336.48 --> 2341.359
but

2337.2 --> 2343.7599999999998
yeah other times he has like

2341.359 --> 2345.7599999999998
inspirational days too where he's like

2343.76 --> 2348.0
really driven and then it's like all

2345.76 --> 2351.3590000000004
fresh it's yeah it's kind of the same

2348.0 --> 2351.359
effect as what happens with me

2351.68 --> 2357.52
some days i'm cranky other days i'm

2354.72 --> 2360.0789999999997
really inspired and really focused and

2357.52 --> 2363.44
so is he he can be very inspired and

2360.079 --> 2365.28
focused and like oversee and especially

2363.44 --> 2366.96
explain with

2365.28 --> 2369.0400000000004
a lot of eloquence

2366.96 --> 2371.44
i like those moments

2369.04 --> 2376.079
in other moments he's just like really

2371.44 --> 2376.079
like a greedy goblin annoying

2381.44 --> 2384.0
like

2382.8 --> 2387.28
alex is

2384.0 --> 2389.359
is like tenacious but

2387.28 --> 2393.28
he's terrible at winning because it

2389.359 --> 2397.0
immediately just turns him into annoying

2393.28 --> 2397.0
and greedy like

2400.32 --> 2404.6400000000003
he just can't handle it he can't handle

2402.24 --> 2404.64
winning

2405.04 --> 2409.56
it always just drives him nuts

2420.83 --> 2423.9
[Music]

2427.28 --> 2430.5600000000004
hey random explorer

2431.68 --> 2435.16
let's see you

2475.599 --> 2478.4
yeah kinda bear

2479.76 --> 2483.2000000000003
it's been very confronting

2487.92 --> 2492.839
like i was there in 2010 when it was

2490.4 --> 2495.44
basically like setting the the

2492.839 --> 2496.56
mission like this is what they're gonna

2495.44 --> 2499.04
do

2496.56 --> 2501.599
like we got the documents and he was all

2499.04 --> 2503.44
like all scared out of his mind looking

2501.599 --> 2504.48
like oh [ __ ]

2503.44 --> 2507.119
and that was

2504.48 --> 2509.839
just that was there

2507.119 --> 2512.4
i was there watching life and

2509.839 --> 2515.48
realized that he was right and that

2512.4 --> 2518.0
everybody was going to be like super

2515.48 --> 2520.319
tenaciously reluctant

2518.0 --> 2523.52
to absorb any of that

2520.319 --> 2526.52
and everybody was just nobody wanted to

2523.52 --> 2526.52
know

2543.68 --> 2548.48
uh end game yeah

2546.4 --> 2551.839
the obama deception

2548.48 --> 2551.839
yeah yeah me too

2553.28 --> 2556.5600000000004
yeah those were that was the golden age

2555.28 --> 2561.5600000000004
like between

2556.56 --> 2561.56
i think 2006 and 2000

2564.319 --> 2570.48
2000 yeah it was pretty much

2567.68 --> 2573.839
until 2012

2570.48 --> 2576.8
and then when trump came in that like

2573.839 --> 2579.119
before he won it was like really great

2576.8 --> 2580.8
then when he actually won

2579.119 --> 2582.079
things got weird

2580.8 --> 2584.6400000000003
like

2582.079 --> 2585.92
like the entire tone of everything

2584.64 --> 2587.68
changed

2585.92 --> 2589.04
trump is like this really weird

2587.68 --> 2590.96
influencing

2589.04 --> 2593.599
figure

2590.96 --> 2597.04
like on a grand scale

2593.599 --> 2597.04
and he changed everything

2599.119 --> 2603.6800000000003
temporarily at least

2601.52 --> 2606.96
i think overall

2603.68 --> 2611.8799999999997
afterward it was a change for the better

2606.96 --> 2611.88
but not all of it was just good

2634.88 --> 2641.6800000000003
yeah aaron russo interview

2638.56 --> 2641.68
yeah that was an older one

2642.96 --> 2648.0
he did some really great things

2646.079 --> 2650.2400000000002
back in the day just good projects

2648.0 --> 2652.88
interesting projects

2650.24 --> 2656.0
i still remember like the

2652.88 --> 2656.0
uh what's called again

2657.04 --> 2662.96
conspiracy theory

2659.2 --> 2665.7599999999998
it was like really typical show

2662.96 --> 2667.68
very american style

2665.76 --> 2670.7200000000003
very attention grabby but it was

2667.68 --> 2670.72
actually really good

2672.079 --> 2678.8
with the jesse fentura

2676.079 --> 2680.1600000000003
that was actually a really impressive

2678.8 --> 2682.0
show

2680.16 --> 2684.24
and but it was kind of advertised like

2682.0 --> 2686.079
oh this is cookie conspiracy but it

2684.24 --> 2688.24
wasn't

2686.079 --> 2689.3590000000004
there was a lot of very serious things

2688.24 --> 2691.52
in there

2689.359 --> 2694.0789999999997
and that was like really mind-blowing i

2691.52 --> 2697.119
think that was like 2010 as well around

2694.079 --> 2697.119
that time i'm not sure

2699.68 --> 2704.2
was it yeah it should have been 2010.

2725.92 --> 2731.4
[Music]

2727.359 --> 2731.4
yeah seeking style water

2732.96 --> 2737.68
well a lot of what has happened even

2735.04 --> 2739.119
back then even back then was getting

2737.68 --> 2741.359
erased

2739.119 --> 2743.76
it's also when like a lot of censorship

2741.359 --> 2745.44
start it's basically when for the first

2743.76 --> 2747.76
time

2745.44 --> 2749.68
like social media platforms like youtube

2747.76 --> 2751.8390000000004
started to decide like we're going to

2749.68 --> 2753.839
delete that information and it was

2751.839 --> 2755.52
really painful

2753.839 --> 2756.96
it was corruption before that that

2755.52 --> 2759.52
didn't happen

2756.96 --> 2761.28
things were ignored

2759.52 --> 2764.24
they didn't really delete things like

2761.28 --> 2764.2400000000002
that politically

2765.119 --> 2773.2400000000002
and now we're kind of used to that

2768.88 --> 2773.2400000000002
but that was kind of new at the time

2799.359 --> 2806.48
yeah i i agree borders boy

2803.119 --> 2806.48
yeah citizen journalism

2806.56 --> 2812.4
thanks to social media

2810.24 --> 2814.319
basically thanks to mobile phones and

2812.4 --> 2817.28
internet

2814.319 --> 2819.2
have like it has really kind of

2817.28 --> 2821.3590000000004
changed the game

2819.2 --> 2823.1189999999997
like it's that's one of the few things

2821.359 --> 2824.16
that came out of it they're actually

2823.119 --> 2828.28
good

2824.16 --> 2828.2799999999997
that that is an option now

2831.599 --> 2836.8
like you don't have to like

2834.0 --> 2838.88
have giant expenditures for

2836.8 --> 2840.88
equipment just to be a journalist now

2838.88 --> 2841.6800000000003
that's the big difference because that

2840.88 --> 2843.119
was

2841.68 --> 2846.24
that was what

2843.119 --> 2848.8
it was required every time

2846.24 --> 2848.7999999999997
in the past

2850.16 --> 2855.359
but now anybody everybody has like a

2853.04 --> 2858.16
smartphone of some kind and yeah they're

2855.359 --> 2859.68
very easy to just turn them into social

2858.16 --> 2862.5589999999997
media

2859.68 --> 2865.52
live journalism streaming devices

2862.559 --> 2865.52
or recording it

2865.68 --> 2872.04
so no more giant expenditures

2868.64 --> 2872.04
to be a journalist

2897.119 --> 2900.119
huh

2942.16 --> 2946.0
what do you mean flatter sage

2944.48 --> 2948.16
it's quite sad that our law

2946.0 --> 2951.8
reinforcement doesn't understand free

2948.16 --> 2951.7999999999997
press what do you mean

3010.24 --> 3013.839
they think you need credentials

3020.079 --> 3023.079
right

3038.079 --> 3044.7200000000003
well i i don't know kevlar it depends on

3041.119 --> 3044.7200000000003
the region i think

3046.72 --> 3051.4399999999996
i'm not sure how it works like

3048.24 --> 3051.4399999999996
technically you shouldn't

3051.599 --> 3056.48
shouldn't have

3052.839 --> 3056.48
any papers

3056.8 --> 3061.96
to be part of free press that's true

3077.2 --> 3082.839
man

3078.96 --> 3082.839
what's going on

3119.839 --> 3122.64
hmm

3120.96 --> 3124.7200000000003
let me consider your press if you work

3122.64 --> 3127.04
for a major network

3124.72 --> 3127.04
right

3127.92 --> 3131.6800000000003
well that's not free press then

3136.24 --> 3142.5589999999997
i mean any person

3139.599 --> 3146.6400000000003
that just wants to have like a youtube

3142.559 --> 3149.599
show or whatever channel show

3146.64 --> 3152.24
bitchute or rockfin or something out

3149.599 --> 3154.319
there d life and they want to be like

3152.24 --> 3157.2799999999997
yeah i'm gonna stream on my mobile on

3154.319 --> 3159.2799999999997
the street and that's my show

3157.28 --> 3161.76
that's

3159.28 --> 3163.76
journalism

3161.76 --> 3165.6800000000003
like anybody has a right to do that

3163.76 --> 3168.7200000000003
right as long as they don't do

3165.68 --> 3168.72
illegal things

3169.119 --> 3172.48
or encourage

3170.4 --> 3173.839
to do illegal things on the spot or

3172.48 --> 3175.68
something

3173.839 --> 3179.64
that's

3175.68 --> 3179.64
that's just journalism

3182.48 --> 3188.8
so yeah any any type of group that would

3185.28 --> 3190.96
basically say no you're required to be

3188.8 --> 3193.6800000000003
a certain type of press then you know

3190.96 --> 3196.319
that they're not

3193.68 --> 3198.64
basically allowing free press

3196.319 --> 3201.2
they're only allowing controlled press

3198.64 --> 3205.96
right that's control press

3201.2 --> 3205.96
not free press that's control press

3213.119 --> 3218.0
or organized press you could say

3216.0 --> 3219.839
it's like no they're only going to give

3218.0 --> 3222.839
out what they want to give out that's

3219.839 --> 3222.839
controlled

3228.559 --> 3234.0
but yeah i don't even fully understand

3231.119 --> 3236.319
like how the laws and

3234.0 --> 3238.559
the rights really work in that setup

3236.319 --> 3238.5589999999997
right

3242.24 --> 3246.8799999999997
i mean at the same time nobody's like

3244.52 --> 3249.2
obligated to

3246.88 --> 3251.76
share their story with just some random

3249.2 --> 3253.52
person that's doing a news blog

3251.76 --> 3257.4
right

3253.52 --> 3257.4
that also counts

3275.04 --> 3279.48
hey james mason good to see you

3295.359 --> 3302.319
yeah yeah letter stage that's terrible

3298.48 --> 3302.319
and it's counterproductive as well

3305.839 --> 3310.4
like it is actually counterproductive to

3307.92 --> 3310.4
do that

3312.559 --> 3317.0400000000004
if if cops like

3314.799 --> 3320.4
for wherever region you are if you're

3317.04 --> 3322.4
going to basically just

3320.4 --> 3324.319
make it impossible for people to do

3322.4 --> 3327.28
journalism

3324.319 --> 3328.72
because you don't want to or whatever

3327.28 --> 3329.92
you're just going to make yourself the

3328.72 --> 3332.5589999999997
enemy

3329.92 --> 3335.28
well you could also actually use the

3332.559 --> 3338.1600000000003
opportunity to to kind of show off like

3335.28 --> 3341.6800000000003
how responsible as cops you are

3338.16 --> 3341.68
right if you're doing a good job

3342.319 --> 3346.5589999999997
so

3344.48 --> 3349.599
it should never be a default to just

3346.559 --> 3351.92
like oh no no press

3349.599 --> 3354.48
no because you're there to keep order

3351.92 --> 3357.2000000000003
right you're there to do the right thing

3354.48 --> 3360.88
uphold the law

3357.2 --> 3363.839
you should not be embarrassed

3360.88 --> 3366.4
to be shown off through journalism what

3363.839 --> 3366.4
you're doing

3372.319 --> 3376.88
like if you're actually doing the right

3374.319 --> 3380.0
thing

3376.88 --> 3382.6400000000003
then as a cop i would kind of invite

3380.0 --> 3384.0
press and be like yeah

3382.64 --> 3385.2
this is what we're doing this is how

3384.0 --> 3389.4
we're trained

3385.2 --> 3389.3999999999996
and we're just doing our best

3393.599 --> 3398.4
you're right

3395.359 --> 3398.4
so anyway

3399.44 --> 3403.52
every time i see cops doing that i'm

3401.359 --> 3406.0
always like you ass

3403.52 --> 3408.079
you're such an ass like what kind of a

3406.0 --> 3410.24
cop would just do that

3408.079 --> 3410.2400000000002
just

3411.119 --> 3415.76
power tripping coward

3413.68 --> 3419.839
but you think you could just you

3415.76 --> 3423.119
have the right to anonymity

3419.839 --> 3425.44
if you're in a public function

3423.119 --> 3429.319
with powers like that

3425.44 --> 3429.319
no not really

3433.28 --> 3435.6800000000003
i mean

3436.64 --> 3440.5589999999997
yeah

3438.24 --> 3442.0
you know if it harasses you that's

3440.559 --> 3444.079
different

3442.0 --> 3446.88
somebody's actually trying to get under

3444.079 --> 3448.88
your nerves as a journalist yeah that's

3446.88 --> 3450.88
different

3448.88 --> 3453.119
that you got to balance that out as a

3450.88 --> 3455.2000000000003
journalist you know if you're going to

3453.119 --> 3457.119
ask risky questions that might be very

3455.2 --> 3459.7599999999998
triggering you got to realize that yeah

3457.119 --> 3463.839
if you go too far

3459.76 --> 3466.1600000000003
it's literally gonna make them snap

3463.839 --> 3468.799
and that's your fault

3466.16 --> 3470.5589999999997
as a journalist you went you push them

3468.799 --> 3472.88
too hard

3470.559 --> 3475.8390000000004
still dealing with human beings and they

3472.88 --> 3475.839
have to keep order

3476.24 --> 3478.5589999999997
right

3478.72 --> 3483.2799999999997
it's complicated it's all very

3480.72 --> 3486.68
complicated really

3483.28 --> 3486.6800000000003
in my opinion

3516.24 --> 3521.04
right so yeah like

3518.96 --> 3522.799
where's the limits right where are the

3521.04 --> 3524.4
limits it's like

3522.799 --> 3526.4
if you're going to be a citizen

3524.4 --> 3528.96
journalist towards a cop right

3526.4 --> 3532.4
well you can't force a cop to uh to

3528.96 --> 3534.2400000000002
answer questions for example

3532.4 --> 3535.04
which i think you do have the right to

3534.24 --> 3537.839
just

3535.04 --> 3539.2799999999997
film them observe what they're doing

3537.839 --> 3540.96
in their job

3539.28 --> 3544.2400000000002
like they will not have the right to

3540.96 --> 3545.92
stop you

3544.24 --> 3547.2
right

3545.92 --> 3548.96
but you can't

3547.2 --> 3551.04
you don't have the right to get in their

3548.96 --> 3553.599
face and demand answers from them or

3551.04 --> 3557.24
something right

3553.599 --> 3557.2400000000002
that's just basics

3562.24 --> 3567.1189999999997
right you got to be lucky to have a cop

3564.559 --> 3569.44
that's really self-confident and

3567.119 --> 3571.119
has some pr skills and that will just be

3569.44 --> 3572.88
like yeah yeah

3571.119 --> 3575.04
we're doing this we're doing that that

3572.88 --> 3577.599
will actually communicate with free

3575.04 --> 3579.359
press with people that are asking

3577.599 --> 3581.52
they'll make themselves available to

3579.359 --> 3582.799
that they gotta have some pr skills for

3581.52 --> 3585.52
that

3582.799 --> 3587.7599999999998
right a lot of cops don't

3585.52 --> 3589.52
they're just kind of gruntish

3587.76 --> 3592.559
they're just like for the physical

3589.52 --> 3594.96
action they got the instincts

3592.559 --> 3597.119
to like see action coming but they're

3594.96 --> 3601.839
not like super social skilled right

3597.119 --> 3601.839
that's not all cops are like that

3607.44 --> 3613.2400000000002
i don't know i don't know if any of you

3609.119 --> 3613.2400000000002
are even listening to me here

3654.559 --> 3660.2400000000002
what

3656.96 --> 3661.92
are you talking about bladder sage

3660.24 --> 3664.4799999999996
called the cops

3661.92 --> 3664.48
people

3666.079 --> 3671.3590000000004
because people

3668.079 --> 3674.6400000000003
are documenting their visit

3671.359 --> 3674.64
with public officials

3676.72 --> 3679.72
really

3688.64 --> 3692.48
well that's yeah

3690.4 --> 3695.6800000000003
look it all depends on if they're going

3692.48 --> 3699.52
to be violating privacy right i mean if

3695.68 --> 3700.8799999999997
a public official is visiting

3699.52 --> 3703.2
and they're still on the street and

3700.88 --> 3706.7200000000003
they're going into the home yeah you are

3703.2 --> 3708.48
absolutely allowed to film that

3706.72 --> 3711.359
absolutely there's nothing they could do

3708.48 --> 3713.52
but if you're then going to like

3711.359 --> 3717.0389999999998
stand in the garden or something and

3713.52 --> 3719.599
film through the window inside

3717.039 --> 3723.2000000000003
that's a violation of privacy that's

3719.599 --> 3724.799
where they can actually arrest you

3723.2 --> 3726.799
technically you're have you're gonna

3724.799 --> 3729.0389999999998
have to be really sneaky

3726.799 --> 3730.96
and leak it out somehow then but that's

3729.039 --> 3733.119
technically illegal right it's

3730.96 --> 3734.48
complicated i think i think it works

3733.119 --> 3736.559
like that

3734.48 --> 3741.05
it's ah it's just

3736.559 --> 3747.659
it's never been my greatest talent

3741.05 --> 3747.659
[Music]

3786.31 --> 3789.409
[Music]

3795.76 --> 3800.079
and we achieve nothing of what are you

3798.079 --> 3803.559
talking about

3800.079 --> 3803.559
borders boy

3811.52 --> 3816.319
yeah

3813.359 --> 3818.799
upset what george sanford said yeah why

3816.319 --> 3821.119
did you speak for yourself boy

3818.799 --> 3821.119
dude

3821.76 --> 3828.7990000000004
there's nothing of worth oh yes there is

3825.119 --> 3830.559
we are absolutely figuring it out

3828.799 --> 3832.24
we are like

3830.559 --> 3835.3590000000004
getting together we're like we're

3832.24 --> 3837.52
literally tapping into a weave

3835.359 --> 3840.64
of consciousness through the internet

3837.52 --> 3842.799
and are like collectively ascending and

3840.64 --> 3844.0789999999997
where before this was attempted it would

3842.799 --> 3845.92
be like

3844.079 --> 3848.319
whoa i'm seeing this stuff but then

3845.92 --> 3850.64
there's like nobody to get it now

3848.319 --> 3852.88
suddenly we can literally end up in

3850.64 --> 3855.1189999999997
situations where as we are ascending

3852.88 --> 3856.88
we're surrounded directly by other

3855.119 --> 3860.2400000000002
people that are ascending on the same

3856.88 --> 3861.52
level it's like a whole new game

3860.24 --> 3863.2799999999997
it's a whole

3861.52 --> 3866.28
different

3863.28 --> 3866.28
awakening

3866.48 --> 3871.039
so i disagree there's absolutely all

3868.559 --> 3872.559
kinds of things of worth we're like

3871.039 --> 3875.28
rediscovering

3872.559 --> 3878.079
internal talents

3875.28 --> 3880.3190000000004
that have never really come afloat in a

3878.079 --> 3883.2000000000003
long long time probably not since the

3880.319 --> 3883.2
atlantean age

3892.0 --> 3896.48
right also we're figuring out what's

3894.64 --> 3898.8799999999997
real what isn't

3896.48 --> 3901.2
and deriving from that what is important

3898.88 --> 3903.52
to become good at

3901.2 --> 3906.3999999999996
and what are the pitfalls we need to

3903.52 --> 3908.319
avoid those are really important

3906.4 --> 3910.48
collective

3908.319 --> 3912.96
knowledge that we're building up all

3910.48 --> 3915.2
together

3912.96 --> 3918.799
like very focused

3915.2 --> 3921.799
it's like a an automated

3918.799 --> 3921.799
government

3922.16 --> 3925.44
it's automated collective

3923.68 --> 3928.72
self-governance

3925.44 --> 3928.7200000000003
yeah that's new

3930.0 --> 3933.76
right and there's still a lot of deluded

3932.0 --> 3935.359
people that are just off track they're

3933.76 --> 3937.2000000000003
just making a mess

3935.359 --> 3938.799
but there's still plenty of people that

3937.2 --> 3940.0789999999997
are very focused and that they're doing

3938.799 --> 3942.96
it correctly

3940.079 --> 3945.119
that are still climbing the ladder

3942.96 --> 3946.799
and there's a lot of us a lot of people

3945.119 --> 3949.52
doing that

3946.799 --> 3952.64
so this is definitely not the age of

3949.52 --> 3952.64
complete useless

3952.72 --> 3956.5589999999997
i mean it can be if you just

3955.119 --> 3959.039
if you just screw up or you're

3956.559 --> 3961.039
discouraged or you think you can't do it

3959.039 --> 3962.6400000000003
you underestimate yourself or you

3961.039 --> 3964.96
underestimate

3962.64 --> 3967.52
the magnificence of the design of

3964.96 --> 3967.52
creation

3976.0 --> 3978.799
okay you're just being a debbie downer

3978.0 --> 3979.76
now

3978.799 --> 3983.4
dude

3979.76 --> 3983.4
get a grip man

4005.359 --> 4007.839
right

4016.079 --> 4023.599
this is facts yeah you forgot the facts

4021.44 --> 4026.7200000000003
facts

4023.599 --> 4026.7200000000003
facts was a machine

4026.96 --> 4032.76
right remember fax was there before the

4029.76 --> 4032.76
email

4037.839 --> 4042.0789999999997
right so we definitely yeah

4040.319 --> 4044.64
the facts

4042.079 --> 4046.079
remains that there's been a lot of

4044.64 --> 4048.64
development

4046.079 --> 4050.48
a lot of rapid communication but because

4048.64 --> 4052.96
of rapidness

4050.48 --> 4055.68
apathy and this is a universal luxury

4052.96 --> 4058.7200000000003
problem it's the problem with

4055.68 --> 4060.64
efficiency if you become too efficient

4058.72 --> 4062.64
then you gain

4060.64 --> 4064.96
time to spare

4062.64 --> 4067.1189999999997
then if you don't quickly fill out

4064.96 --> 4068.799
something good for that time to spare

4067.119 --> 4071.44
it's going to start

4068.799 --> 4074.0
churning at you you're gonna get bored

4071.44 --> 4075.839
that's how demons are gonna slip in

4074.0 --> 4077.68
eventually and you're gonna then end up

4075.839 --> 4079.839
wasting your time a lot

4077.68 --> 4082.5589999999997
and actually corrupting things boredom

4079.839 --> 4082.5589999999997
is terrible

4084.16 --> 4088.72
right

4086.16 --> 4091.839
but that's not everybody

4088.72 --> 4094.64
there might be you

4091.839 --> 4094.64
borders boy

4095.52 --> 4098.76
not everybody

4111.279 --> 4114.839000000001
crazy faxes

4122.0 --> 4125.159
all right

4136.319 --> 4142.719
dude hey

4139.12 --> 4142.719
put a lid on it for this boy

4144.64 --> 4148.159000000001
you you seem to just be

4148.64 --> 4153.92
carrying out yeah

4150.799 --> 4156.159
projecting here a lot of negativity this

4153.92 --> 4158.08
is what what what good is this to you

4156.159 --> 4160.4
doing this

4158.08 --> 4162.4
i'm already telling you like no

4160.4 --> 4165.2789999999995
that's technically not true this is just

4162.4 --> 4165.2789999999995
one side of it

4168.48 --> 4173.44
right

4169.92 --> 4178.319
yeah a luxury can be a prison

4173.44 --> 4181.3589999999995
but only if you allow it to become that

4178.319 --> 4184.319
right luxury problems are always the

4181.359 --> 4186.4800000000005
main problem is to realize

4184.319 --> 4188.319
that you're not a victim that you

4186.48 --> 4190.959999999999
actually have an opportunity and you

4188.319 --> 4192.799
need to exploit it and you have let your

4190.96 --> 4194.32
laziness

4192.799 --> 4196.64
turn you

4194.32 --> 4199.28
to become delusional about it

4196.64 --> 4202.159000000001
to basically fantasize how about how you

4199.28 --> 4203.759999999999
are a victim when you are not

4202.159 --> 4205.679
i think you might

4203.76 --> 4209.4400000000005
need to zoom in

4205.679 --> 4209.4400000000005
on that concept a bit

4212.159 --> 4217.04
i thought you would like to explore the

4214.56 --> 4220.2390000000005
apparent there's no paradox

4217.04 --> 4220.239
it's not a paradox

4220.8 --> 4225.28
if it was a paradox then it wouldn't

4222.8 --> 4225.28
exist

4225.92 --> 4232.2390000000005
right paradoxes are only ever

4228.84 --> 4236.110000000001
conceptual because in physical reality

4232.239 --> 4239.25
they can't exist that's the point

4236.11 --> 4239.25
[Music]

4249.36 --> 4254.0
right with more information

4252.719 --> 4255.12
and more

4254.0 --> 4257.44
room

4255.12 --> 4259.44
or more challenge right

4257.44 --> 4262.48
you can build you can

4259.44 --> 4265.5199999999995
attain greater insight you can then

4262.48 --> 4267.599999999999
realize important things in the world

4265.52 --> 4269.76
and take responsibility

4267.6 --> 4273.84
and then that responsibility will be the

4269.76 --> 4275.92
challenge the new level of approach

4273.84 --> 4277.92
it's never really a trap it's only a

4275.92 --> 4278.96
trap if you're being a debbie downer

4277.92 --> 4280.719
about it

4278.96 --> 4282.56
and just say it's all hopeless this oh

4280.719 --> 4285.04
yeah that's gonna make it all hopeless

4282.56 --> 4287.84
that's literally you creating that

4285.04 --> 4287.84
for yourself

4298.56 --> 4304.320000000001
there's a lot of people out there

4301.84 --> 4306.8
that are ascending

4304.32 --> 4309.12
i'm noticing actually a lot of older

4306.8 --> 4311.4400000000005
people especially

4309.12 --> 4313.28
that would probably let's say if it was

4311.44 --> 4315.28
50 years ago and there were that age

4313.28 --> 4319.199
they would probably be bored to death

4315.28 --> 4320.96
literally literally bored to death right

4319.199 --> 4322.48
they've achieved a certain level of

4320.96 --> 4324.4
wisdom

4322.48 --> 4325.919999999999
but like yeah

4324.4 --> 4328.08
how are you gonna share that well now

4325.92 --> 4331.679
there's the internet and they are

4328.08 --> 4334.159
actually almost like wizards

4331.679 --> 4335.92
getting really freaking smart at an

4334.159 --> 4337.44
older age

4335.92 --> 4339.28
and they were always kind of smart but

4337.44 --> 4342.08
now it's getting even better so it's

4339.28 --> 4344.8
just what you're saying is just wrong

4342.08 --> 4347.04
it's incomplete

4344.8 --> 4350.8
there's a lot of people that are

4347.04 --> 4353.199
really ascending thanks to the internet

4350.8 --> 4355.04
especially older people

4353.199 --> 4356.799999999999
right the older you get the less mobile

4355.04 --> 4359.44
you tend to get

4356.8 --> 4363.2390000000005
well the internet still allows you to

4359.44 --> 4363.239
pretty much go everywhere

4375.92 --> 4379.52
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4377.6 --> 4384.280000000001
understanding what things are are

4379.52 --> 4384.280000000001
critical in order to change them

4384.4 --> 4388.96
if you're dealing with things that are

4386.159 --> 4391.5199999999995
your traps that are your prisons and you

4388.96 --> 4392.64
don't understand how they work and why

4391.52 --> 4394.8
they work

4392.64 --> 4396.84
then you can't do anything about them

4394.8 --> 4398.56
you can only screw yourself

4396.84 --> 4399.6
over

4398.56 --> 4401.6
right

4399.6 --> 4404.64
well thanks to the internet

4401.6 --> 4406.159000000001
we can now collectively figure out

4404.64 --> 4408.719
what they are

4406.159 --> 4411.44
we have a public

4408.719 --> 4413.52
collective counter organization it's

4411.44 --> 4415.839999999999
it's collective there's no it's not

4413.52 --> 4419.280000000001
really organized but it is automated

4415.84 --> 4420.96
automatically organized by our wills

4419.28 --> 4423.84
to actually

4420.96 --> 4426.0
figure out political control mechanisms

4423.84 --> 4430.8
and social engineering

4426.0 --> 4430.8
devices that we are being subjected to

4432.64 --> 4436.400000000001
so it's very much about action

4435.04 --> 4437.36
eventually

4436.4 --> 4439.599999999999
right

4437.36 --> 4443.199
the ability to figure out what the trap

4439.6 --> 4443.1990000000005
is is invaluable

4448.4 --> 4453.199
right now now let's think back

4451.04 --> 4455.04
a few decades half a century in the

4453.199 --> 4457.839999999999
soviet union right

4455.04 --> 4459.679
no internet

4457.84 --> 4460.96
so yeah

4459.679 --> 4463.12
back then

4460.96 --> 4464.88
whatever the government was

4463.12 --> 4466.88
pulling out of their ass and like

4464.88 --> 4469.28
subjecting their people to with weird

4466.88 --> 4470.88
ideas

4469.28 --> 4472.8
people would just have to sit through it

4470.88 --> 4474.2390000000005
because there was no internet there was

4472.8 --> 4476.88
no

4474.239 --> 4478.959999999999
site like public psychologists they were

4476.88 --> 4482.2390000000005
all controlled they were all from the

4478.96 --> 4486.0
state like you couldn't figure it out

4482.239 --> 4486.0
now we can all figure it out

4490.4 --> 4493.4
right

4499.28 --> 4503.84
when you have no sources of information

4502.0 --> 4506.239
and you're being subjected to a trap

4503.84 --> 4510.400000000001
that's effectively isolation that drives

4506.239 --> 4512.799999999999
you mad we have the internet now

4510.4 --> 4515.679
and can still like the internet's very

4512.8 --> 4517.679
enabling for you to drive yourself mad

4515.679 --> 4519.52
if that's what you're looking for but if

4517.679 --> 4521.92
you're actually looking for

4519.52 --> 4523.4400000000005
to be informed or to help out

4521.92 --> 4526.88
with that

4523.44 --> 4528.0
then you can actually do that it's a big

4526.88 --> 4530.400000000001
plus

4528.0 --> 4532.719
compared to soviet

4530.4 --> 4534.5599999999995
union times

4532.719 --> 4538.64
where they didn't have that luxury all

4534.56 --> 4541.120000000001
they had was basically book works

4538.64 --> 4543.360000000001
from really smart philosophers that were

4541.12 --> 4546.88
already

4543.36 --> 4546.88
like trying to figure it out

4547.679 --> 4552.88
that yeah it's it's kind of a miracle

4550.48 --> 4554.4
that that all worked out

4552.88 --> 4556.0
it didn't all

4554.4 --> 4559.12
but yeah

4556.0 --> 4561.6
now there's the internet it that process

4559.12 --> 4563.599999999999
is a lot easier now

4561.6 --> 4567.280000000001
because you can

4563.6 --> 4569.6
now if you choose to figure out what the

4567.28 --> 4571.84
control mechanisms are what the social

4569.6 --> 4573.679
engineering devices are that we are all

4571.84 --> 4576.96
being subjected to

4573.679 --> 4576.96
that's a big difference

4578.48 --> 4581.839999999999
with 50 years ago

4605.679 --> 4609.76
now we have global communication in zero

4607.92 --> 4611.92
revolution what

4609.76 --> 4614.92
dude what rock have you been living

4611.92 --> 4614.92
under

4637.44 --> 4641.12
not a call to action but to inaction

4639.52 --> 4643.52
yeah but that's because you're being a

4641.12 --> 4645.679
short-sighted ass

4643.52 --> 4647.6
borders boy

4645.679 --> 4648.96
no

4647.6 --> 4651.04
what it is is

4648.96 --> 4655.52
yeah it's not it's a call to action but

4651.04 --> 4657.76
you gotta get informed first and then

4655.52 --> 4659.84
then

4657.76 --> 4661.04
you gotta face

4659.84 --> 4663.92
the true

4661.04 --> 4666.4
realization of what the situation is and

4663.92 --> 4668.32
find your bravery and then still do it

4666.4 --> 4671.92
right

4668.32 --> 4674.0
it's just don't rush blindly into action

4671.92 --> 4676.56
without information without knowing what

4674.0 --> 4678.719
you're gonna face

4676.56 --> 4680.320000000001
that's the overall

4678.719 --> 4682.4
thing

4680.32 --> 4685.04
get informed first first

4682.4 --> 4688.4
get a feel for it figure it out get used

4685.04 --> 4690.88
to it right take some time

4688.4 --> 4692.879999999999
don't just like ah i'm pissed off at

4690.88 --> 4695.28
this i'm gonna storm at it right now

4692.88 --> 4698.159000000001
because that's always gonna be

4695.28 --> 4698.159
a disaster

4700.08 --> 4704.8
right there is a call to action

4702.08 --> 4706.64
eventually i've already like

4704.8 --> 4708.320000000001
put some things out there that have

4706.64 --> 4710.88
absolutely

4708.32 --> 4715.5199999999995
have echoed around the world

4710.88 --> 4715.52
and most people wish it that it wouldn't

4716.32 --> 4719.599999999999
that's the thing about it just because

4717.84 --> 4721.84
you don't want

4719.6 --> 4725.88
reality to go somewhere doesn't mean it

4721.84 --> 4725.88
won't actually go there

4743.52 --> 4748.6
no no action setup dude

4750.159 --> 4755.5199999999995
right so what's happening

4752.4 --> 4757.5199999999995
by the real resistance whatever that is

4755.52 --> 4760.64
majority public that are trying to get

4757.52 --> 4764.719
out of this mind control madness

4760.64 --> 4765.92
first there's just non-cooperation

4764.719 --> 4768.04
right

4765.92 --> 4770.32
as long as there's still an option for

4768.04 --> 4772.32
non-cooperation that's the way it needs

4770.32 --> 4774.88
to be done and like even in governments

4772.32 --> 4776.639999999999
themselves even within

4774.88 --> 4779.28
political

4776.64 --> 4780.08
groups and structures

4779.28 --> 4784.4
just

4780.08 --> 4788.08
let them not get away with more crap

4784.4 --> 4790.639999999999
like the v passport like just let that

4788.08 --> 4793.92
just not let that happen right that sort

4790.64 --> 4796.64
of thing and it's a constant struggle

4793.92 --> 4798.88
but it is being resisted though it like

4796.64 --> 4800.0
it is being

4798.88 --> 4801.84
if it just

4800.0 --> 4806.4
absolutely didn't do anything then it

4801.84 --> 4807.6
would turn into hell very very quickly

4806.4 --> 4809.679
like

4807.6 --> 4813.84
very quickly

4809.679 --> 4813.84
if there was absolutely no action

4815.36 --> 4819.679
if you just went along with everything

4817.199 --> 4822.799999999999
people are not though they are resisting

4819.679 --> 4826.08
but it starts out to the passive

4822.8 --> 4827.360000000001
and then if it doesn't recede

4826.08 --> 4829.5199999999995
the

4827.36 --> 4831.5199999999995
yeah the madness

4829.52 --> 4835.040000000001
the autocracy

4831.52 --> 4838.96
mind control infection

4835.04 --> 4839.76
that's when real action happens

4838.96 --> 4842.159
but

4839.76 --> 4844.84
like if that gets to that point it's

4842.159 --> 4848.239
always disastrous it always is

4844.84 --> 4848.2390000000005
disastrous right

4851.04 --> 4856.32
there's always going to be things just

4853.44 --> 4858.799999999999
damaged weakened destroyed

4856.32 --> 4858.799999999999
always

4858.96 --> 4864.96
because that which is in power will not

4861.92 --> 4869.88
relinquish its power

4864.96 --> 4869.88
when the power is all that it is about

4905.4 --> 4908.5599999999995
[Music]

4915.12 --> 4922.159
being more informed

4917.44 --> 4922.159
learning and learning is a stimulant

4922.639 --> 4929.0
for most not accepted that's right

4925.76 --> 4929.0
it's exhilarating

4930.08 --> 4933.12
like

4931.04 --> 4935.679
the problem is is people get over

4933.12 --> 4937.679
excited or they get scared or paranoid

4935.679 --> 4939.6
that's the problem not that they're

4937.679 --> 4941.36
sedated by it

4939.6 --> 4945.320000000001
now the problem is that they're over

4941.36 --> 4945.32
stimulated by it

4945.6 --> 4949.400000000001
that's right omega genesis

4990.4 --> 4996.239
what porter's boy don't call dr utger

4993.6 --> 4998.639
reactionary even if he is one

4996.239 --> 5001.04
right you've been just whining

4998.639 --> 5002.159000000001
you've just been a debbie downey downer

5001.04 --> 5004.4
whiner

5002.159 --> 5004.4
so

5008.08 --> 5014.76
like you've literally been

5010.159 --> 5014.759999999999
very deconstructive and hopeless

5015.12 --> 5021.28
like you've not brought forth a single

5018.56 --> 5022.56
solution type thought not a single one

5021.28 --> 5024.8
border boys

5022.56 --> 5027.280000000001
so don't you

5024.8 --> 5031.4400000000005
tell others in my chat

5027.28 --> 5031.44

opportunity to actually show

5044.48 --> 5049.159
that you can step out of that nonsense

5090.239 --> 5094.32
right

5091.199 --> 5094.32
i think i'm going to run out
