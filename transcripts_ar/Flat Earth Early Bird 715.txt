86.64 --> 93.52
a little bit different from yesterday

89.36 --> 96.56
though yeah over there you can't see

93.52 --> 98.79899999999999
nice blue patch but it is

96.56 --> 100.96000000000001
like in the distance it already kind of

98.799 --> 104.64
looked kind of gray

100.96 --> 104.64
and yeah way over there it's

105.36 --> 111.759
it's getting kind of cloudy

108.399 --> 115.36
still pretty wind still

111.759 --> 117.2
a little bit colder even than yesterday

115.36 --> 119.439
i guess because of the overall lack of

117.2 --> 119.43900000000001
sun

130.64 --> 134.64
all right hold on

138.48 --> 143.84
so i got green tea with me as usual

145.2 --> 149.11999999999998
i got up pretty early today so i went to

148.48 --> 152.319
bed

149.12 --> 152.31900000000002
pretty early just

152.64 --> 160.39999999999998
i don't know i think i needed it

156.56 --> 160.4
yesterday was pretty heavy day

162.56 --> 170.239

good to see you others will follow soon

177.76 --> 182.84
then again it is of course sunday

179.36 --> 185.59900000000002
morning for most people

182.84 --> 188.72
um

185.599 --> 188.72
hey here we go again

196.84 --> 200.0
so

198.0 --> 202.56
didn't make a lot of extensive notes

200.0 --> 206.159
from yesterday but there was

202.56 --> 209.28
some things that i was doing uh

206.159 --> 212.48
i was owen benjamin live but

209.28 --> 215.2
yeah i got what was i doing i was caught

212.48 --> 217.28
up doing something else

215.2 --> 219.28
and then when i started following then

217.28 --> 221.44
yeah after half an hour ball buster

219.28 --> 225.28
started up so i got in there

221.44 --> 228.879
i kind of missed it too bad

225.28 --> 232.08
uh right then ball busters happened

228.879 --> 235.28
was a pretty good show i think

232.08 --> 238.56
or well at least i was yeah

235.28 --> 242.64000000000001
i was good i was just in uh

238.56 --> 244.31900000000002
i was focused sometimes i can be a

242.64 --> 246.39999999999998
little drunkish on it

244.319 --> 249.04
especially if i completely forget that

246.4 --> 249.04
it's there and

250.48 --> 254.159
but not this time so it was pretty good

253.2 --> 257.12
show

254.159 --> 259.03999999999996
i had a very long talk afterward with

257.12 --> 261.199
some guy that was also

259.04 --> 262.40000000000003
the last moment on the panel through

261.199 --> 265.44
discord

262.4 --> 266.84
don't remember his name but a guy from

265.44 --> 270.08
israel

266.84 --> 273.11999999999995
and yeah we had some really

270.08 --> 276.56
deep ethereal esoteric

273.12 --> 280.08
conversations because he was well

276.56 --> 283.6
studied including like in

280.08 --> 284.4
yeah jewish stuff so that was pretty

283.6 --> 288.8
heavy

284.4 --> 291.03999999999996
conversation we had just the two of us

288.8 --> 292.08
uh yeah not gonna let in the details but

291.04 --> 295.6
just trying to

292.08 --> 296.15999999999997
figure out what he knows and he really

295.6 --> 299.12
test

296.16 --> 300.72
he tried to hear me out he really had a

299.12 --> 302.96
feel for these things

300.72 --> 305.52000000000004
because he knew how to ask the right

302.96 --> 308.4
questions and actually let me answer it

305.52 --> 310.56
you know that's a sign that they have

308.4 --> 313.919
that reach

310.56 --> 316.479
so it was pretty interesting guy

313.919 --> 317.68
and yeah who knows maybe i asked him

316.479 --> 320.8
like yeah dude

317.68 --> 325.52
if if that's good for you you can just

320.8 --> 327.759
come and visit the show in chat at least

325.52 --> 329.84
and since he is living in israel the

327.759 --> 333.28000000000003
time slot should not be too

329.84 --> 337.11999999999995
off it's in the middle of the day

333.28 --> 340.88
but yeah we'll see

337.12 --> 344.16
uh it is sunday morning after all

340.88 --> 346.96
right and then after ball busters

344.16 --> 347.759
uh yeah martin luther flat today hang

346.96 --> 351.039
out

347.759 --> 353.28000000000003
like it really just hang out hang out uh

351.039 --> 354.08
didn't follow all the details i came in

353.28 --> 355.52
kind of late

354.08 --> 358.08
because i think it was already going

355.52 --> 367.84
when ball busters were still going

358.08 --> 367.84
and but it was still fun

369.6 --> 374.639
right after that

372.8 --> 381.84000000000003
[Music]

374.639 --> 381.84000000000003
what did i do

388.08 --> 391.44
right did i watch anything

392.08 --> 397.75899999999996
listening music again yeah i've been

394.479 --> 402.24
dipping into my old music

397.759 --> 406.47900000000004
like the the playlist like the flat cuts

402.24 --> 406.479
that i've made myself years ago

406.56 --> 411.039
and it's music that i don't really

408.639 --> 413.68
listen to anymore it's like too noisy

411.039 --> 416.31899999999996
for me now

413.68 --> 418.319
but yeah man there's some wild [ __ ] in

416.319 --> 423.12
there so just listening to it again and

418.319 --> 425.599
and how i cut it together it's like whoa

423.12 --> 427.199
like a magical musical orchestra in its

425.599 --> 429.599
own way and it's

427.199 --> 431.28000000000003
fascinating the depths that i'd spotted

429.599 --> 433.52
in it in the meanings of

431.28 --> 436.0
the despairing words that are even said

433.52 --> 438.639
in it and

436.0 --> 439.52
yeah because these days i just listened

438.639 --> 441.36
to kind of like

439.52 --> 443.28
i guess what is called deep house

441.36 --> 444.08000000000004
although this could probably mean

443.28 --> 448.15999999999997
anything

444.08 --> 448.15999999999997
to any to all kinds of people

449.52 --> 456.4
but just like high-tech trends

453.12 --> 460.16
and like smooth focused

456.4 --> 460.96
and melodic and that's always what i

460.16 --> 462.88000000000005
liked

460.96 --> 464.56
and yeah because of the high-tech sounds

462.88 --> 466.879
these guys that make this

464.56 --> 469.599
really know what they're doing they're

466.879 --> 473.28000000000003
not simpletons

469.599 --> 474.479
and i like that the music challenges my

473.28 --> 478.15999999999997
senses

474.479 --> 482.479
in a good way doesn't try to break them

478.16 --> 484.40000000000003
uh but yeah i used to listen to

482.479 --> 486.479
like more drummond-based jungle and

484.4 --> 488.15999999999997
there was a whole renewal of this

486.479 --> 490.639
because i originally listened to that in

488.16 --> 493.12
the in the 90s

490.639 --> 495.759
when it was really fresh when the the

493.12 --> 497.759
sampling of sounds just really started

495.759 --> 500.08000000000004
to happen and there was just this

497.759 --> 502.8
these people on their computers just

500.08 --> 505.84
making this stuff

502.8 --> 507.12
but it was pretty yeah old quality sound

505.84 --> 508.87899999999996
effects well

507.12 --> 510.24
i didn't realize that it had still

508.879 --> 511.52000000000004
continued i knew it was

510.24 --> 514.479
at some point there was a lot of

511.52 --> 518.56
interest in like drum and bass

514.479 --> 521.519
and then yeah like the jungle scene

518.56 --> 523.68
changed to drum and bass and well

521.519 --> 524.5600000000001
i found like music that i kind of

523.68 --> 528.0799999999999
thought

524.56 --> 531.4399999999999
this is yeah the updated virtual of

528.08 --> 533.519
jungle really in its own way

531.44 --> 536.08
and yeah found a whole bunch of music

533.519 --> 537.839
about that on youtube big big playlists

536.08 --> 540.399
and then started to cut them down

537.839 --> 542.399
because they were giant mixes

540.399 --> 544.16
and then i literally just surgically

542.399 --> 544.48
removed parts of them that i thought

544.16 --> 548.56
were

544.48 --> 552.0
just derailing or demoralizing or just a

548.56 --> 552.399
yeah a defocusing influence and then try

552.0 --> 554.32
to

552.399 --> 555.6
flat cut it as i call it because i don't

554.32 --> 558.5600000000001
know how to mix

555.6 --> 560.48
i literally just find the right moment

558.56 --> 561.04
where something stops and something

560.48 --> 563.839
starts

561.04 --> 564.8
and just kind of like magically make it

563.839 --> 566.8000000000001
switch

564.8 --> 569.1999999999999
was quite a challenge and sometimes it's

566.8 --> 572.0799999999999
just impossible

569.2 --> 573.839
but that was fun to do and i think that

572.08 --> 577.519
listening back to the results

573.839 --> 579.9200000000001
yeah some of those flat cuts

577.519 --> 581.04
were pretty damn good in my own opinion

579.92 --> 584.88
even though it's

581.04 --> 588.3199999999999
subpar for yeah a real

584.88 --> 588.32
musical editor of course

589.04 --> 592.56
i'm just going by my hearing and by the

591.68 --> 596.16
minimum

592.56 --> 599.68
ability possible as it were

596.16 --> 602.88
right uh but that

599.68 --> 603.68
and including that was first and then

602.88 --> 608.0
came

603.68 --> 611.4399999999999
like no that came second because before

608.0 --> 616.079
i touched upon the

611.44 --> 619.519
more extreme even the dubstep

616.079 --> 623.3599999999999
like wild wild uh

619.519 --> 626.079
wild sound effects [ __ ]

623.36 --> 627.6
and there was some pretty fascinating

626.079 --> 629.5999999999999
deep melodic

627.6 --> 630.72
dubstep too you know not all of it is

629.6 --> 632.72
just like

630.72 --> 634.0790000000001
trying to shake you around try to pull

632.72 --> 635.839
you out of whack

634.079 --> 638.3199999999999
now there was actually some really

635.839 --> 640.0790000000001
interesting stuff out there too

638.32 --> 642.72
and i got some songs together that are

640.079 --> 644.8
just absolutely literally mind-blowing

642.72 --> 647.2
when you hear them they literally just

644.8 --> 649.04
blow your [ __ ] mind and pull you into

647.2 --> 651.9200000000001
this virtual world

649.04 --> 652.959
and like force your face like look at

651.92 --> 656.24
this

652.959 --> 660.56
look at this and

656.24 --> 663.92
yeah that greatly impressed me

660.56 --> 666.7199999999999
and some even like these guys know about

663.92 --> 669.1999999999999
sound effects they they figure that out

666.72 --> 672.24
maybe just purely intuitive because

669.2 --> 674.48
also recognize just the soundscapes the

672.24 --> 676.64
influence of sounds that was also

674.48 --> 678.5600000000001
part of the development through the cia

676.64 --> 680.3199999999999
no less

678.56 --> 682.2399999999999
they had four knowledge when this

680.32 --> 686.1600000000001
technology arrived

682.24 --> 686.16
and they tried to also

686.839 --> 695.2
like sound trademark

690.839 --> 698.32
associate with certain effects

695.2 --> 699.9200000000001
yeah and that's been kind of like worked

698.32 --> 702.9590000000001
into

699.92 --> 703.519
copyright systems even but this yeah

702.959 --> 705.279
this is

703.519 --> 707.12
something that i've picked on it's like

705.279 --> 709.04
wow this specific sound effect where did

707.12 --> 712.0
it come from how is it being used where

709.04 --> 712.0
do they put it in

714.839 --> 719.2790000000001
right and yeah because of all this music

718.0 --> 721.279
man i just

719.279 --> 724.639
keep on having this weird idea like i

721.279 --> 724.639
want to have like this big

725.279 --> 732.48
i guess woke flat earth whatever party

728.88 --> 734.88
and just play this music because yeah

732.48 --> 737.12
i can't really do that on my show that

734.88 --> 737.12
would

737.92 --> 743.279
definitely get copyright struck but i do

741.279 --> 744.079
kind of like want to share it and see

743.279 --> 747.2
like if i could

744.079 --> 750.56
pull people into the same pretty

747.2 --> 754.399
heavy mind journey through that

750.56 --> 757.5189999999999
and if they spot the same things if they

754.399 --> 758.8
see the same virtual things i'm just

757.519 --> 763.519
fascinated

758.8 --> 763.519
anyway oh music wizardry

768.88 --> 773.8389999999999
all right hey agm by the way and samson

771.12 --> 773.839
george sanford

776.959 --> 787.8389999999999
so yeah i've been i guess been listening

779.2 --> 787.839
music a lot

795.51 --> 798.63
[Music]

805.98 --> 810.37
[Music]

812.839 --> 816.639
anyway right so that that was me

815.2 --> 818.1600000000001
rambling on about music

816.639 --> 819.6800000000001
that i'm unfortunately not going to

818.16 --> 823.199
share i can just

819.68 --> 826.16
give you the rough source for the music

823.199 --> 826.16
that i listen now

827.519 --> 830.72
and that's pretty much the grand sound

829.839 --> 832.72
channel

830.72 --> 834.32
that's the the deep house music that i

832.72 --> 836.0
listen to these days

834.32 --> 837.519
yeah i plucked pretty much everything

836.0 --> 840.839
from their channel then

837.519 --> 843.839
try to search for the independent songs

840.839 --> 843.839
and

847.279 --> 852.88
and yeah just for the record

850.8 --> 854.24
not all of what they play there i think

852.88 --> 856.72
is good

854.24 --> 858.48
but i'd say that half of it is pretty

856.72 --> 861.0400000000001
good

858.48 --> 863.12
and some of them are like really

861.04 --> 868.16
manipulative yeah you can feel them

863.12 --> 868.16
like try to mind control you some it's

870.0 --> 873.12
probably pick up on that

882.839 --> 885.839
right

891.92 --> 896.959
but yeah like all the music that i was

893.92 --> 896.959
talking about the

897.04 --> 905.68
the new jungle and

900.24 --> 909.6
the dubstep that's all from like 2008

905.68 --> 909.5999999999999
to 2015.

910.639 --> 917.6800000000001
and i kind of like discovered

914.079 --> 921.3599999999999
the latter part in 2015

917.68 --> 921.3599999999999
and 16.

925.44 --> 931.44
so it's probably music that some of you

928.72 --> 933.6800000000001
have have come across during that period

931.44 --> 936.9590000000001
might the music might even direct

933.68 --> 939.04
directly make you associate with the way

936.959 --> 941.4399999999999
things were back then

939.04 --> 943.04
i've also noticed this it like kind of

941.44 --> 946.1600000000001
pulls me back and so

943.04 --> 949.92
yeah the dubstep does have

946.16 --> 953.4399999999999
like it was in a time where i was

949.92 --> 956.7199999999999
very tense as you all might remember

953.44 --> 958.5600000000001
so it yeah it is every time it's not

956.72 --> 959.6800000000001
something that i'd be willing to listen

958.56 --> 961.92
for hours on end

959.68 --> 963.7589999999999
like even like during listening just the

961.92 --> 965.8389999999999
one thing that i had put together i had

963.759 --> 967.44
to pause it

965.839 --> 969.6
every now and then because it was just

967.44 --> 971.759
getting too overwhelming

969.6 --> 975.44
dragging me back into the mindset of

971.759 --> 975.44
then which is not a good one

980.24 --> 983.36
good music comes from good quality

982.24 --> 986.5600000000001
instruments well it's

983.36 --> 986.5600000000001
the whole different world

986.959 --> 994.399
it's it's different

991.12 --> 997.519
i think that there are also

994.399 --> 997.92
quite fascinating electronic sounds that

997.519 --> 1000.72
have

997.92 --> 1001.8389999999999
simply been generated from a computer

1000.72 --> 1004.48
but

1001.839 --> 1006.399
it is different from musical instruments

1004.48 --> 1011.839
i'm very well aware of it

1006.399 --> 1011.839
it's like a whole different spectrum

1016.56 --> 1022.8
and it can be utilized to emulate

1019.759 --> 1025.76
reality as much as it can be utilized to

1022.8 --> 1027.52
discontort from it

1025.76 --> 1030.079
and there was definitely a lot of

1027.52 --> 1030.959
discontortion experimentation going on

1030.079 --> 1034.3999999999999
with the depths

1030.959 --> 1036.64
dubstep music scene literally as i

1034.4 --> 1038.72
described they were literally just using

1036.64 --> 1041.8390000000002
extremities and

1038.72 --> 1043.919
sound flashiness to wreck you

1041.839 --> 1045.839
sometimes or even try to make you

1043.919 --> 1049.3600000000001
oscillate and [ __ ] which is

1045.839 --> 1051.6789999999999
really yeah

1049.36 --> 1054.4799999999998
it can't even be dangerous in my opinion

1051.679 --> 1056.24
if you're very sensitive

1054.48 --> 1057.84
like there's been songs where i would

1056.24 --> 1059.2
listen but why i would basically

1057.84 --> 1061.52
fascinatedly

1059.2 --> 1063.2
listen like oh then exo what's the net

1061.52 --> 1064.4
sun and then we'd be like okay i don't

1063.2 --> 1066.16
like this

1064.4 --> 1067.76
and then it would start to oscillate and

1066.16 --> 1070.64
be like oh [ __ ]

1067.76 --> 1071.6
oh [ __ ] man if i continue listening it

1070.64 --> 1076.24
almost feels like i

1071.6 --> 1076.24
get a heart attack or something so

1079.0 --> 1083.12
[Music]

1080.24 --> 1084.16
i uh eventually learned to recognize

1083.12 --> 1086.32
those and just

1084.16 --> 1087.3600000000001
get him out of the way and that's also

1086.32 --> 1090.799
what started

1087.36 --> 1093.9189999999999
my attempt to flat cut

1090.799 --> 1095.8899999999999
the situation huh hey

1093.919 --> 1098.989
cameron gilmore

1095.89 --> 1098.989
[Music]

1105.039 --> 1109.36
all right but yeah george sanford good

1107.919 --> 1111.76
music comes from good quality

1109.36 --> 1114.799
instruments absolutely

1111.76 --> 1118.64
i absolutely agree with that

1114.799 --> 1122.16
and that's even i my proof

1118.64 --> 1125.3600000000001
that i actually do is that

1122.16 --> 1128.64
for example baldur's gate

1125.36 --> 1132.0
i love the music it was all

1128.64 --> 1135.039
sampled and recorded and then edited

1132.0 --> 1136.0
into a wide variety of musicals a music

1135.039 --> 1139.039
escaped is just

1136.0 --> 1141.6
incredible the possibilities

1139.039 --> 1142.4
that was a pretty awesome unique project

1141.6 --> 1145.84
but it is

1142.4 --> 1146.72
like it is basically what they did with

1145.84 --> 1150.32
the

1146.72 --> 1151.1200000000001
music is modulize it actual recorded

1150.32 --> 1154.6399999999999
instruments

1151.12 --> 1158.2399999999998
modulize it brilliant

1154.64 --> 1160.3200000000002
freaking brilliant

1158.24 --> 1163.1200000000001
but it was literally recorded it's not

1160.32 --> 1164.1599999999999
some digital sound effect emulating it

1163.12 --> 1166.8799999999999
not some cheap ass

1164.16 --> 1168.4
sample no no no real sampled recordings

1166.88 --> 1171.3600000000001
high quality

1168.4 --> 1174.0
relatively high quality for the time and

1171.36 --> 1174.0
it's brilliant

1175.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
what the [ __ ] get out of here

1182.18 --> 1185.309
[Music]

1189.95 --> 1194.229
[Music]

1199.15 --> 1203.719
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1207.84
ah

1210.32 --> 1213.6
so how are you guys all doing

1214.96 --> 1224.559
are you having a very calm morning

1220.799 --> 1227.679
it seems very calm over here too

1224.559 --> 1230.32
and you guys seem to be very

1227.679 --> 1230.3200000000002
chilled out

1233.44 --> 1241.28
my rpg knowledge is impeccable that's

1237.6 --> 1247.12
really but you can only say that

1241.28 --> 1247.12
if yours is really good are you into dnd

1247.6 --> 1255.1999999999998
but yes i do pride myself to be

1250.96 --> 1257.919
sickeningly specialized in dnd yes

1255.2 --> 1259.679
it's almost in retrospect it almost

1257.919 --> 1261.679
feels like a waste because i also

1259.679 --> 1264.5590000000002
discovered the specific dnd

1261.679 --> 1265.6000000000001
platforms limitations and issues and

1264.559 --> 1268.6399999999999
i've tried

1265.6 --> 1272.1589999999999
very greatly to figure out how to

1268.64 --> 1275.039
solve it how to balance it

1272.159 --> 1278.7990000000002
and understand also the consequences for

1275.039 --> 1282.799
the how to be a gay master with it

1278.799 --> 1284.24
very difficult but why i like it despite

1282.799 --> 1287.9189999999999
all the

1284.24 --> 1288.559
obvious game breaking issues that it has

1287.919 --> 1290.7990000000002
because

1288.559 --> 1292.24
they are game breaking literally when

1290.799 --> 1294.8799999999999
players come to that point

1292.24 --> 1295.679
the game breaks because things get too

1294.88 --> 1298.5590000000002
convoluted

1295.679 --> 1299.6000000000001
they get bored people lose track they

1298.559 --> 1301.44
stop playing

1299.6 --> 1305.4399999999998
right well i tried to figure how to deal

1301.44 --> 1309.919
with this somehow

1305.44 --> 1309.919
and it's really difficult

1312.559 --> 1318.0
but why i do like it why i hadn't given

1315.679 --> 1319.8400000000001
up on it is because of the sheer

1318.0 --> 1323.679
preponderance

1319.84 --> 1324.8799999999999
of data and creative elements that have

1323.679 --> 1327.44
been added on

1324.88 --> 1330.48
in a modulized way in a modulized

1327.44 --> 1333.28
understanding of the system

1330.48 --> 1334.799
and a lot of it is pretty decent in the

1333.28 --> 1337.84
official capacity

1334.799 --> 1340.72
now what i did was basically make my own

1337.84 --> 1343.52
version based on the 3.5 system

1340.72 --> 1344.72
based on those vantage point rules and

1343.52 --> 1348.799
then

1344.72 --> 1351.76
evolved them sometimes completely

1348.799 --> 1352.559
replacing elements but very sparingly

1351.76 --> 1356.08
why

1352.559 --> 1359.36
so that my system could literally fit on

1356.08 --> 1362.32
any other 3.5 game

1359.36 --> 1363.4399999999998
approach that's why i did that i really

1362.32 --> 1367.4399999999998
tried to

1363.44 --> 1370.559
yeah make a high advanced modulated

1367.44 --> 1373.2
adaptation and then

1370.559 --> 1374.0
spotted other attempts that were very

1373.2 --> 1376.72
short-sighted

1374.0 --> 1378.559
and for people to do that the similar

1376.72 --> 1380.799
things and then literally even took

1378.559 --> 1382.48
elements from other books referenced

1380.799 --> 1385.679
them very specifically like this

1382.48 --> 1387.679
is the replacement for disability in

1385.679 --> 1390.64
that book

1387.679 --> 1391.44
for your reference because you don't

1390.64 --> 1393.2800000000002
need that book

1391.44 --> 1395.1200000000001
it's described right here what it does

1393.28 --> 1395.44
but it is literally also a statement

1395.12 --> 1398.3999999999999
like

1395.44 --> 1398.96
that is corrected because that is no

1398.4 --> 1402.5590000000002
longer

1398.96 --> 1405.8400000000001
allowed because it will destabilize

1402.559 --> 1409.6789999999999
the balance of the powers

1405.84 --> 1409.6789999999999
of all things right

1410.4 --> 1416.3200000000002
and yeah i'm really proud of that work i

1413.679 --> 1418.5590000000002
had some assistance with other

1416.32 --> 1420.6399999999999
people that at the time had much more

1418.559 --> 1422.559
oversight even over dnd there were

1420.64 --> 1427.1200000000001
longer fans of it i

1422.559 --> 1430.24
yeah i had some issues it's like

1427.12 --> 1431.84
so but i rounded it out as far as i can

1430.24 --> 1435.279
i can still add on things

1431.84 --> 1437.6789999999999
it's just that it's just gonna be

1435.279 --> 1439.76
detail detailing it's like polishing it

1437.679 --> 1441.2
that way polishing that way oh look a

1439.76 --> 1443.52
little item that's

1441.2 --> 1445.3600000000001
interesting optional that i can just add

1443.52 --> 1448.72
oh look another item knock another

1445.36 --> 1452.32
like potentially if this keeps going

1448.72 --> 1455.3600000000001
in like 10 years it'll be like the books

1452.32 --> 1458.799
and then it's like yeah here's a list of

1455.36 --> 1462.8799999999999
every conceivable awesome and balanced

1458.799 --> 1465.52
n story useful magical item that could

1462.88 --> 1468.2900000000002
ever be conceived within the framework

1465.52 --> 1470.48
of the dnd 3.5 system

1468.29 --> 1472.08
[Laughter]

1470.48 --> 1474.08
because i keep on like every now and

1472.08 --> 1475.36
then it's like oh ooh this could be

1474.08 --> 1477.36
interesting

1475.36 --> 1479.12
oh this could be interesting so that

1477.36 --> 1480.32
list just keeps on growing and growing

1479.12 --> 1482.08
and growing

1480.32 --> 1484.24
while all the others it's just been

1482.08 --> 1486.08
finalized i finalized the skills there's

1484.24 --> 1488.08
really nothing more that you could think

1486.08 --> 1491.48
of that would be sensible

1488.08 --> 1493.84
to add on to that really unless you're

1491.48 --> 1496.799
dissatisfied that you want

1493.84 --> 1499.039
the crystal structure to be different

1496.799 --> 1500.799
because you want that

1499.039 --> 1504.24
well that's very nice you can do that if

1500.799 --> 1507.6
you like but it's all

1504.24 --> 1512.32
as modulated adaptable

1507.6 --> 1512.32
as can be that's how i designed it right

1512.84 --> 1515.84
so

1520.159 --> 1528.4
a d and d a d and d that's that's old

1524.96 --> 1531.919
a d and d that's like

1528.4 --> 1543.8400000000001
that's 2.5 ah two point

1531.919 --> 1543.8400000000001
yeah the two series i'm not mistaken

1549.54 --> 1553.44
[Music]

1550.799 --> 1554.32
yeah you know what is really funny what

1553.44 --> 1557.3600000000001
is really

1554.32 --> 1560.6399999999999
really freaking funny about

1557.36 --> 1564.1589999999999
d mechanics

1560.64 --> 1568.72
is it has literally the dnd world

1564.159 --> 1572.0800000000002
has its physics it's game physics

1568.72 --> 1575.1200000000001
and there are like loop

1572.08 --> 1577.4399999999998
issues and there are

1575.12 --> 1580.0
that not it's very sure of enough but

1577.44 --> 1580.0
just like

1580.159 --> 1583.6000000000001
there are mechanics where you can

1581.76 --> 1584.24
basically do to the mechanics as a

1583.6 --> 1585.84
character

1584.24 --> 1588.08
cheat so that you could like move

1585.84 --> 1590.72
insanely much instantly

1588.08 --> 1591.36
without using magic which would be like

1590.72 --> 1594.559
a cheat

1591.36 --> 1596.8799999999999
like that's in balance there were all

1594.559 --> 1598.799
of these kinds of issues and people

1596.88 --> 1599.3600000000001
wanted that and that's a problem with

1598.799 --> 1601.52
dnd

1599.36 --> 1603.52
it allows flexibility so if you have

1601.52 --> 1605.2
players that want to cheat

1603.52 --> 1607.76
yeah you're gonna have to either tame

1605.2 --> 1609.3600000000001
them or allow them to cheat basically

1607.76 --> 1611.12
and adapt to that it's all about what

1609.36 --> 1613.9189999999999
the game master really wants and if he's

1611.12 --> 1617.6789999999999
going to [ __ ] to his players

1613.919 --> 1621.919
it's a risk as a game master

1617.679 --> 1626.96
that yeah that's but

1621.919 --> 1630.64
i basically try to perfect

1626.96 --> 1633.1200000000001
the physics it's of the dnd

1630.64 --> 1634.5590000000002
realm and i think i pretty well

1633.12 --> 1639.6789999999999
succeeded

1634.559 --> 1639.6789999999999
i've actually made pretty much

1639.76 --> 1647.2
a law book for the workings of magic

1643.76 --> 1650.48
within dnd a standard i

1647.2 --> 1650.96
yeah and i hope people took note because

1650.48 --> 1655.039
i

1650.96 --> 1659.2
made very very carefully consideration

1655.039 --> 1660.399
considered balance in a lot of my spell

1659.2 --> 1663.1200000000001
designs especially

1660.399 --> 1663.9189999999999
like because i completely redefined

1663.12 --> 1669.84
teleport

1663.919 --> 1669.8400000000001
plane shift all kinds of like really

1672.159 --> 1677.7600000000002
reality altering spells that really make

1675.279 --> 1680.08
the mechanics of how things work

1677.76 --> 1682.08
completely different the consequences of

1680.08 --> 1685.9189999999999
having these powers available

1682.08 --> 1688.1589999999999
i figured it out through dnd and then

1685.919 --> 1689.679
basically gave a framework for how can

1688.159 --> 1693.0390000000002
you have these powers

1689.679 --> 1693.919
without breaking everything what by what

1693.039 --> 1696.559
rules

1693.919 --> 1698.159
must it be limited and how would that be

1696.559 --> 1702.399
logical

1698.159 --> 1703.44
so yeah that's where i spent a lot of

1702.399 --> 1707.039
energy

1703.44 --> 1707.039
and focus on back in the day

1707.919 --> 1711.44
and i'm really proud of it i'd read it

1710.799 --> 1714.72
out

1711.44 --> 1724.0
if people care for that but maybe

1714.72 --> 1727.279
i don't know

1724.0 --> 1729.919
it lend itself well to your descriptions

1727.279 --> 1733.76
in your fv arguments isn't that funny

1729.919 --> 1736.48
because that came first it was my

1733.76 --> 1737.44
training project it was my model my

1736.48 --> 1740.88
reality

1737.44 --> 1743.44
building model basically

1740.88 --> 1744.0
and it was a good practice especially

1743.44 --> 1747.2
because

1744.0 --> 1749.679
it trained me in vast vast

1747.2 --> 1751.679
reach oversight understanding the

1749.679 --> 1752.799
consequences of the fast reach oversight

1751.679 --> 1754.88
and how you lose track

1752.799 --> 1756.96
all these things like i have this

1754.88 --> 1760.0
experience of doing that

1756.96 --> 1762.559
and that experience lend itself

1760.0 --> 1763.279
really amazingly well in my endeavor so

1762.559 --> 1766.399
far

1763.279 --> 1768.08
because when flat earth really

1766.399 --> 1770.799
entered when it really kind of was

1768.08 --> 1773.76
allowed to basically enter me after so

1770.799 --> 1776.48
long and so many attempts

1773.76 --> 1777.36
it's like all of that information

1776.48 --> 1780.0
instantly

1777.36 --> 1782.08
filled everything that was already there

1780.0 --> 1783.2
which was quite a fast structure and

1782.08 --> 1786.0
suddenly i was

1783.2 --> 1786.3990000000001
seeing the things that other people

1786.0 --> 1789.2
would

1786.399 --> 1791.039
not be able to see and why i figured out

1789.2 --> 1792.24
the sun is freaking holographic here's

1791.039 --> 1794.1589999999999
why i'm right there

1792.24 --> 1796.88
and why do people want it to be a ball

1794.159 --> 1800.48
because of physicality assumption bias

1796.88 --> 1804.72
these things were virtually in my mind

1800.48 --> 1806.48
in 2015. i just didn't really know how

1804.72 --> 1808.96
to

1806.48 --> 1810.3990000000001
bring the message yet it's like okay if

1808.96 --> 1813.44
i'm just going to say that

1810.399 --> 1816.799
like that like a pc people would

1813.44 --> 1819.039
then treat me like a pga

1816.799 --> 1822.48
so that's not what i was going to do i

1819.039 --> 1825.52
was just going to

1822.48 --> 1828.88
concise crystals concepts

1825.52 --> 1831.36
and just let it sink let it go

1828.88 --> 1832.0
through the soup of everything else is

1831.36 --> 1835.52
going on

1832.0 --> 1837.36
and then see if it'll clear up if people

1835.52 --> 1837.9189999999999
will suddenly start to recognize the

1837.36 --> 1841.1999999999998
pattern

1837.919 --> 1845.039
and figure it out and it worked

1841.2 --> 1848.32
it's working it's working a lot

1845.039 --> 1851.2
and i'm really proud of that and i guess

1848.32 --> 1854.799
it's partially thanks to my

1851.2 --> 1857.919
dnd world building training

1854.799 --> 1861.12
that's that i was able to basically

1857.919 --> 1864.5590000000002
figure things out really quickly

1861.12 --> 1865.039
and some yeah in a strategical way over

1864.559 --> 1869.519
time

1865.039 --> 1869.519
bring it to the rest of the people

1871.6 --> 1878.6399999999999
because yeah even in my games and this

1875.279 --> 1881.84
was very awesome that the players

1878.64 --> 1882.3200000000002
would understand this not being able to

1881.84 --> 1885.519
deal

1882.32 --> 1887.9189999999999
with reality was actually a

1885.519 --> 1889.679
theme that we were dealing with and the

1887.919 --> 1890.64
characters there were characters that

1889.679 --> 1893.76
were literally

1890.64 --> 1896.72
just irresponsible they they would

1893.76 --> 1897.6
do whatever was necessary but sometimes

1896.72 --> 1901.2
they would also

1897.6 --> 1901.519
cower away and then literally play out

1901.2 --> 1905.279
like

1901.519 --> 1909.1200000000001
why absolutely fascinating

1905.279 --> 1921.2
fascinating and

1909.12 --> 1922.9599999999998
yeah that also helped

1921.2 --> 1926.0
right and and parts of those things are

1922.96 --> 1928.72
also in the book

1926.0 --> 1930.08
because we did not have this stupid

1928.72 --> 1932.88
normal people habit

1930.08 --> 1934.559
of like oh this character is the stupid

1932.88 --> 1936.96
one or the cowardly one

1934.559 --> 1940.0
so every time he's mentioned we're just

1936.96 --> 1943.2
gonna [ __ ] all over him

1940.0 --> 1945.2
no i didn't do that

1943.2 --> 1947.279
i did kind of allow that people would be

1945.2 --> 1950.32
able to make fun of it

1947.279 --> 1950.72
but also like i kind of forced them from

1950.32 --> 1952.8799999999999
a

1950.72 --> 1954.72
from a psychological standpoint to

1952.88 --> 1955.8400000000001
realize why they are the way they are

1954.72 --> 1957.6000000000001
and even try to

1955.84 --> 1959.039
potentially if their character was

1957.6 --> 1962.08
intelligent or wise enough

1959.039 --> 1965.279
figure out how to get through to them

1962.08 --> 1966.6399999999999
and thus complicated psychological

1965.279 --> 1969.519
interactions between

1966.64 --> 1970.5590000000002
characters simulated by the players

1969.519 --> 1974.0
under

1970.559 --> 1978.96
the guise of me as a game master had

1974.0 --> 1980.96
amazing live conversations

1978.96 --> 1982.24
they were the characters and it was

1980.96 --> 1987.279
complicated it was

1982.24 --> 1987.279
amazing to experience this naturally

1988.84 --> 1991.84
happening

1992.35 --> 1995.619
[Music]

2002.159 --> 2006.64
although that didn't always happen i

2004.64 --> 2008.64
guess it's kind of just like

2006.64 --> 2009.76
with flat earth debates and with my

2008.64 --> 2012.96
shows

2009.76 --> 2014.08
we had great times and we had times

2012.96 --> 2017.679
where we're kind of like

2014.08 --> 2019.9189999999999
getting bumpy like they would get all

2017.679 --> 2023.039
completely pants about trump forks

2019.919 --> 2023.039
they did that sometimes

2024.399 --> 2033.84
so annoying i would literally like

2029.76 --> 2033.84
let's not talk about that

2035.6 --> 2040.9599999999998
because yeah but they just dropped into

2039.2 --> 2045.1200000000001
that habit because they were just

2040.96 --> 2048.56
like gushing liberals

2045.12 --> 2050.6389999999997
but softy liberals but still media

2048.56 --> 2054.0
echoing liberals in many ways

2050.639 --> 2055.9190000000003
at times it's very annoying

2054.0 --> 2061.839
but still good people and that's very

2055.919 --> 2061.839
important to me

2064.92 --> 2069.04
[Music]

2067.2 --> 2070.399
right and good people that i could

2069.04 --> 2074.159
confide in

2070.399 --> 2075.359
that i did share a lot of my inner

2074.159 --> 2078.8
turmoil with like

2075.359 --> 2080.96
one of the guys it's basically been the

2078.8 --> 2084.079
pillar player

2080.96 --> 2087.2
he's a nurse he is a nurse yeah

2084.079 --> 2089.3590000000004
and he was just very very

2087.2 --> 2091.4399999999996
understanding and i basically also

2089.359 --> 2093.7599999999998
shared times like a help i'm

2091.44 --> 2095.679
having nightmares and this is what the

2093.76 --> 2098.48
nightmare is i would basically

2095.679 --> 2100.32
be able to throw it out in full panic in

2098.48 --> 2102.32
his face

2100.32 --> 2103.839
and not let it grow out control but just

2102.32 --> 2105.44
to show like the help

2103.839 --> 2108.32
this is what i'm dealing with i guess

2105.44 --> 2112.0
like a really close friend

2108.32 --> 2115.119
and he would get it and even at times

2112.0 --> 2116.0
give pretty good advice but he was also

2115.119 --> 2117.76
very

2116.0 --> 2119.52
well he could point out like this is

2117.76 --> 2120.079
going over my head i don't understand

2119.52 --> 2122.96
that and

2120.079 --> 2123.92
this i definitely get it's very clear in

2122.96 --> 2127.839
the communication

2123.92 --> 2127.839
it's just great it's great to have

2128.56 --> 2146.0789999999997
people like that in physical interaction

2144.0 --> 2149.839
and the guy by the way was crushing he

2146.079 --> 2149.8390000000004
is a father of two kids

2149.92 --> 2157.119
and yeah dnd was kind of his last

2153.68 --> 2157.9199999999996
available guy time he even said it like

2157.119 --> 2161.04
that it's like oh

2157.92 --> 2163.119
i've been i've been released again

2161.04 --> 2164.72
because yeah he has two kids and they're

2163.119 --> 2166.48
at that age where they draw a lot of

2164.72 --> 2168.0
attention and one of the kids is

2166.48 --> 2170.8
especially

2168.0 --> 2172.64
like he has some emotional issues so

2170.8 --> 2174.079
probably freaking brilliant doesn't know

2172.64 --> 2176.64
how to handle it

2174.079 --> 2178.079
so he's desensitized himself it's just

2176.64 --> 2181.5989999999997
complicated like that

2178.079 --> 2184.32
i've seen him i've been in his house and

2181.599 --> 2185.119
like i i unders it's like oh my god this

2184.32 --> 2187.119
this guy

2185.119 --> 2188.7200000000003
this kid is almost as annoying as i used

2187.119 --> 2191.839
to be at that age

2188.72 --> 2191.839
this is maybe worse

2192.56 --> 2198.16
right so maybe that is also i guess

2195.68 --> 2199.52
why there might be a better connection

2198.16 --> 2202.3999999999996
between that guy and me

2199.52 --> 2203.359
because maybe i do kind of resonate the

2202.4 --> 2206.4
same

2203.359 --> 2206.4
energy as this kid

2207.04 --> 2209.52
i don't know

2212.0 --> 2220.56
anyway let's move on d d

2215.92 --> 2224.48
good players deep trust is essential

2220.56 --> 2228.0
you can play d and d with just anybody

2224.48 --> 2230.56
but you might then be mixed up

2228.0 --> 2231.92
with things that you morally completely

2230.56 --> 2234.32
disagree with and

2231.92 --> 2236.4
before you know it you've cocked to it

2234.32 --> 2239.839
and they've normalized it

2236.4 --> 2241.44
that's the problem because i've seen

2239.839 --> 2243.7599999999998
that happen

2241.44 --> 2245.839
that's even like how players can just

2243.76 --> 2248.88
suddenly

2245.839 --> 2251.119
start to take over the game

2248.88 --> 2257.839
they they just insert it and the game

2251.119 --> 2257.839
master doesn't know how to stop them

2258.72 --> 2262.0
but yeah there are so there's still

2260.56 --> 2265.04
plenty of game masters that

2262.0 --> 2265.92
do know how to prevent that as well that

2265.04 --> 2268.0
i've seen

2265.92 --> 2271.44
at a distance because i haven't played

2268.0 --> 2271.44
in too many groups as a player

2282.839 --> 2285.839
unfortunately

2289.76 --> 2296.2400000000002
right and you know why too because i

2292.48 --> 2297.599
typically would like to play a paladin

2296.24 --> 2299.7599999999998
and then they don't allow it and then

2297.599 --> 2302.8
okay i'll just go for like a good

2299.76 --> 2305.599
wizard or something and

2302.8 --> 2308.0
they don't get like yeah you i know why

2305.599 --> 2310.32
you don't want a paladin

2308.0 --> 2311.2
because of all the ways people do with

2310.32 --> 2315.44
that they go

2311.2 --> 2318.8799999999997
extremist right maybe a paladin could be

2315.44 --> 2323.28
kind of sensible you know and

2318.88 --> 2325.76
not act rashly actually have to

2323.28 --> 2326.32
deal with stress from tolerating things

2325.76 --> 2328.6400000000003
that he

2326.32 --> 2329.76
should not tolerate but there's a bigger

2328.64 --> 2332.0
plan

2329.76 --> 2333.599
at set they're like they don't even

2332.0 --> 2335.2
understand that

2333.599 --> 2337.04
they've just downgraded the

2335.2 --> 2337.52
understanding of what paladins really

2337.04 --> 2340.88
are

2337.52 --> 2344.16
and the inner conflicts that are

2340.88 --> 2344.1600000000003
accompanied all that

2344.48 --> 2348.56
it's kind of sad that's why i spent a

2346.88 --> 2350.2400000000002
lot of time on developing and

2348.56 --> 2353.839
redeveloping the paladin

2350.24 --> 2354.72
and the black guard as two mirror images

2353.839 --> 2357.599
with

2354.72 --> 2358.56
it it makes sense that's the freaky part

2357.599 --> 2361.52
about it

2358.56 --> 2361.52
if you read through it

2367.359 --> 2372.56
right okay what are you guys talking

2374.56 --> 2377.739
[Music]

2380.839 --> 2383.839
about

2385.599 --> 2401.119
what is this

2397.839 --> 2402.56
right well that's a that's an

2401.119 --> 2404.1800000000003
interesting statement there

2402.56 --> 2406.64
ar

2404.18 --> 2410.16
[Music]

2406.64 --> 2411.92
that's a lot of a's says i have been

2410.16 --> 2414.0789999999997
having disagreement with people who say

2411.92 --> 2415.52
imagination is essential part of science

2414.079 --> 2417.92
i would say otherwise it

2415.52 --> 2420.0
would have been have to be discarded

2417.92 --> 2425.28
being that imagination

2420.0 --> 2428.64
is the antithesis of reality well

2425.28 --> 2430.8
you might misinterpret the context

2428.64 --> 2432.48
and yeah since they are all delusional

2430.8 --> 2433.8390000000004
they don't even understand the context

2432.48 --> 2435.44
of what they're saying because of the

2433.839 --> 2439.44
reason why they're saying it

2435.44 --> 2442.56
doesn't make it untrue because

2439.44 --> 2444.88
what is understanding what is figuring

2442.56 --> 2444.88
it out

2446.16 --> 2456.0
it's visualizing it

2450.72 --> 2458.8799999999997
imagining it and then figuring it out

2456.0 --> 2458.88
so yeah

2459.52 --> 2463.92
if you don't have any imagination

2461.599 --> 2464.8
whatsoever then you can't really figure

2463.92 --> 2467.28
anything out

2464.8 --> 2469.04
you could perhaps just copy it but you

2467.28 --> 2469.92
would not understand why you would not

2469.04 --> 2472.96
upgrade

2469.92 --> 2474.56
its use be able to integrate it into

2472.96 --> 2477.04
more complex structures because you have

2474.56 --> 2481.359
no imagination

2477.04 --> 2484.079
no creativity now it's not an essential

2481.359 --> 2484.0789999999997
part for the

2484.8 --> 2488.8
scientific method because it's just a

2486.72 --> 2492.16
method if you want to

2488.8 --> 2494.0
use something with the scientific method

2492.16 --> 2495.68
yeah you will require a lot of

2494.0 --> 2499.839
imagination just to

2495.68 --> 2501.9199999999996
clearly get to get things clear

2499.839 --> 2503.44
in the application of the scientific

2501.92 --> 2507.52
method

2503.44 --> 2509.44
because if you can't visualize anything

2507.52 --> 2511.7599999999998
then again you're just going to be

2509.44 --> 2513.839
echoing things and not being able to

2511.76 --> 2515.5200000000004
integrate the understanding of what it

2513.839 --> 2523.839
is how and why

2515.52 --> 2523.839
into something bigger

2527.28 --> 2530.6400000000003
now imagination does not mean making up

2529.44 --> 2533.68
junk

2530.64 --> 2537.5989999999997
that's not true

2533.68 --> 2542.319
imagine imagine image

2537.599 --> 2544.88
in right there an image it's a tool

2542.319 --> 2546.8
it's a tool it's a mechanism of our

2544.88 --> 2549.52
consciousness

2546.8 --> 2552.48
now what you do with that tool that is

2549.52 --> 2555.92
going to determine a lot

2552.48 --> 2558.48
and what you allow yourself because your

2555.92 --> 2560.7200000000003
imagination often reflects

2558.48 --> 2562.16
your soul what you have in you and all

2560.72 --> 2565.359
that

2562.16 --> 2567.04
right and people i guess mistakingly

2565.359 --> 2567.5989999999997
think that just because they can hide

2567.04 --> 2570.24
something

2567.599 --> 2572.319
and just keep it in their imagination

2570.24 --> 2574.7999999999997
that it will not be noticed

2572.319 --> 2577.44
well it will be because it will start to

2574.8 --> 2579.04
reflect on your being

2577.44 --> 2582.96
so even though the people do not know

2579.04 --> 2582.96
why they will see the result

2584.72 --> 2589.359
that's a lesson that i had to learn the

2586.72 --> 2593.7599999999998
hard way too

2589.359 --> 2598.0
secrets very very tricky thing

2593.76 --> 2598.0
they'd physically influence you

2598.88 --> 2607.44
right imagination conceptualize exactly

2602.64 --> 2609.359
cameron gilmore gets it

2607.44 --> 2611.76
yeah and just because einstein used the

2609.359 --> 2614.96
concept conjured up a conceptual medium

2611.76 --> 2617.28
and then reified it into reality

2614.96 --> 2619.52
or leave it open to be reified into

2617.28 --> 2622.48
reality does not mean

2619.52 --> 2623.92
that creating conceptual mediums is a

2622.48 --> 2627.119
bad thing

2623.92 --> 2627.92
you know flat space is also a conceptual

2627.119 --> 2631.599
medium

2627.92 --> 2634.64
to give an understanding about yeah

2631.599 --> 2637.04
other dimensional perspectives

2634.64 --> 2637.839
it's a concept it's a very interesting

2637.04 --> 2640.4
concept

2637.839 --> 2643.24
there might be a lot that we might learn

2640.4 --> 2645.04
even in the structurizing of insight

2643.24 --> 2646.72
compartmentalization and all that of

2645.04 --> 2648.56
reality

2646.72 --> 2650.16
it might help insight doesn't mean that

2648.56 --> 2654.24
it is literal

2650.16 --> 2657.44
it's just a concept for demonstration

2654.24 --> 2660.839
see so it's again the imagination

2657.44 --> 2662.56
how do you utilize it that is what

2660.839 --> 2665.839
determines

2662.56 --> 2669.2799999999997
yeah the

2665.839 --> 2673.7599999999998
the path pretty much again

2669.28 --> 2673.76
the principles the code the path

2673.92 --> 2682.56
i hold them here in my imagination

2677.28 --> 2682.5600000000004
i hold them there i make them mine

2686.48 --> 2694.8
there's no room for secrets

2691.2 --> 2699.359
i can't compartmentalize

2694.8 --> 2699.3590000000004
my frustrations into some secret

2699.92 --> 2704.0
i can't do it so i have frustrations and

2703.119 --> 2706.319
then i express

2704.0 --> 2707.44
them and i try to confess everything

2706.319 --> 2711.2
every time

2707.44 --> 2713.359
to basically defuse it to not give it

2711.2 --> 2716.48
some kind of secret grip

2713.359 --> 2720.0789999999997
because if i hold it in in some way

2716.48 --> 2723.119
or if i even imagine to keep it a secret

2720.079 --> 2723.119
then i got a problem

2723.599 --> 2729.839
it basically breaks the flow of what

2726.96 --> 2729.839
my powers

2730.16 --> 2738.0789999999997
that's yeah secrecy i can't do it

2735.119 --> 2738.079
i can hold back

2740.0 --> 2747.839
but i can't really keep a secret

2759.28 --> 2762.2400000000002
let's see it like this

2762.72 --> 2766.0789999999997
just as a scenario comparison if

2765.44 --> 2770.48
somebody

2766.079 --> 2773.3590000000004
tells me something that is in confidence

2770.48 --> 2774.64
and then yeah i might keep it a secret

2773.359 --> 2776.48
from them

2774.64 --> 2778.56
because i know it's important for

2776.48 --> 2781.839
whatever they're doing

2778.56 --> 2784.88
but if they then you

2781.839 --> 2786.16
yeah turn to evil from within that

2784.88 --> 2791.2000000000003
secret

2786.16 --> 2793.2
then i must say it but if they actually

2791.2 --> 2794.72
yeah let go of the darkness within the

2793.2 --> 2796.3999999999996
secrecy

2794.72 --> 2798.24
and even get to the point where they

2796.4 --> 2799.04
will just be able to just come clean

2798.24 --> 2800.7999999999997
with it

2799.04 --> 2802.56
then there is no problem to keep that

2800.8 --> 2805.119
secret but see it is all about the

2802.56 --> 2808.319
frequency it's about the results

2805.119 --> 2811.04
that kind of determines

2808.319 --> 2811.92
whether it actually becomes a secret for

2811.04 --> 2817.839
the darkness

2811.92 --> 2817.839
or whether it's just holding back

2825.62 --> 2828.7599999999998
[Music]

2838.4 --> 2844.079
you don't have to conceptualize the

2840.48 --> 2847.44
answer is there

2844.079 --> 2847.44
you do know why

2855.92 --> 2861.6800000000003
yeah that's of course but if you don't

2858.24 --> 2861.68
have an imagination

2863.599 --> 2869.28
then how are you gonna put all those

2866.64 --> 2869.2799999999997
things together

2869.599 --> 2873.839
it's just gonna be a bunch of stuff to

2871.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
you

2874.319 --> 2877.359
are you going to understand what each

2876.319 --> 2881.7599999999998
consecutive

2877.359 --> 2881.7599999999998
part or step of the process even is

2884.839 --> 2887.839
again

2898.839 --> 2901.839
um

2912.839 --> 2915.839
so

2918.64 --> 2924.5589999999997
oh god big shoe relative density

2921.559 --> 2924.559
disequilibrium

2924.72 --> 2929.839
gravity is a reification

2935.2 --> 2940.96
it's like you're still trying to make an

2938.559 --> 2957.8390000000004
argument that's just

2940.96 --> 2957.839
utterly outdated big shoe

2959.359 --> 2971.839
what's that good servant

2996.839 --> 2999.839
hmm

2999.92 --> 3003.52
all right what what kind of channel is

3009.07 --> 3013.839
[Music]

3010.839 --> 3013.839
that

3021.79 --> 3025.52
[Music]

3031.42 --> 3034.619
[Music]

3044.24 --> 3047.04
oh god

3051.68 --> 3054.7999999999997
can you to please take it to somewhere

3054.319 --> 3057.04
else

3054.8 --> 3059.119
where everybody else is upholding

3057.04 --> 3059.92
outdated arguments and bickering about

3059.119 --> 3068.88
them

3059.92 --> 3071.04
please you too

3068.88 --> 3072.0
so relative density this equilibrium

3071.04 --> 3075.2
acceleration

3072.0 --> 3079.359
relative density this equilibrium done

3075.2 --> 3081.9199999999996
that's what it is so you name any

3079.359 --> 3084.16
phenomenon that you in some way

3081.92 --> 3085.6800000000003
associate with gravity i'll explain it

3084.16 --> 3089.44
instantly

3085.68 --> 3093.359
by scientific provable and repeatable

3089.44 --> 3096.96
standards instantly

3093.359 --> 3100.7999999999997
big shoe so tell me what

3096.96 --> 3101.359
effect in the real world what phenomenon

3100.8 --> 3104.7200000000003
do you

3101.359 --> 3107.119
associate with gravity i'll instantly

3104.72 --> 3110.5589999999997
translate it into relative density is

3107.119 --> 3111.9700000000003
system instantly

3110.559 --> 3115.2900000000004
you can test me on this

3111.97 --> 3115.29
[Music]

3121.57 --> 3126.0
[Music]

3122.88 --> 3129.28
there is no difference

3126.0 --> 3132.64
idiot don't you even get what weight is

3129.28 --> 3133.3590000000004
weight is a convention based on a very

3132.64 --> 3136.4
specific

3133.359 --> 3137.2
relative density this equilibrium

3136.4 --> 3142.2400000000002
between the

3137.2 --> 3144.7999999999997
atmosphere and the object

3142.24 --> 3146.72
right in that specific setting in air

3144.8 --> 3149.119
setting right and guess what

3146.72 --> 3150.9599999999996
yeah at the north pole wherever where

3149.119 --> 3152.0
it's colder and at the equator where

3150.96 --> 3153.52
it's warmer

3152.0 --> 3156.72
yeah the amount of air pressure is

3153.52 --> 3159.119
different so there will be

3156.72 --> 3160.3999999999996
the convention will be altered because

3159.119 --> 3163.2000000000003
the

3160.4 --> 3164.559
the general standard for it has changed

3163.2 --> 3169.4399999999996
somewhat

3164.559 --> 3169.44
because weight is just a convention

3170.72 --> 3177.5989999999997
the mass is not changing but the things

3175.119 --> 3179.44
around it the atmosphere the gases that

3177.599 --> 3181.44
surround it are different so the

3179.44 --> 3183.2000000000003
this equilibrium of the object with the

3181.44 --> 3186.079
medium is slightly different

3183.2 --> 3186.8799999999997
causing it to apply more or less

3186.079 --> 3189.76
pressure

3186.88 --> 3190.6400000000003
slightly microscopically slightly

3189.76 --> 3192.48
because yeah

3190.64 --> 3195.359
it's just a very tiny difference between

3192.48 --> 3198.72
the atmospheric pressures

3195.359 --> 3198.72
so all that

3199.52 --> 3203.04
and any other than that there is no

3201.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
difference

3203.04 --> 3209.839
earth is stationary

3215.839 --> 3223.599
yes sure you can absolutely

3220.4 --> 3225.2000000000003
and if any of those supposed experiments

3223.599 --> 3227.44
that you're blabbering on about that

3225.2 --> 3228.319
just some ballers and jesuits came out

3227.44 --> 3231.119
up with

3228.319 --> 3232.5589999999997
and literally nothing did nothing

3231.119 --> 3236.0
actually controlled

3232.559 --> 3238.48
right i know this or they would

3236.0 --> 3240.0
be hammering it on to us with full

3238.48 --> 3241.92
registered view on it

3240.0 --> 3243.52
all the time and they don't because it's

3241.92 --> 3245.119
never been done properly

3243.52 --> 3246.72
they have a completely controlled

3245.119 --> 3248.96
atmospheric room

3246.72 --> 3250.7999999999997
with an exact pressure and content

3248.96 --> 3254.2400000000002
everything and then do that

3250.8 --> 3255.3590000000004
both locations to have it exactly equal

3254.24 --> 3256.7999999999997
pressure

3255.359 --> 3258.88
wherever it is doesn't really matter

3256.8 --> 3261.04
whether it's underground above ground

3258.88 --> 3262.7200000000003
high in the air one place on the earth

3261.04 --> 3265.599
or another

3262.72 --> 3267.1189999999997
if the pressure is exactly controlled

3265.599 --> 3270.1600000000003
there will be no

3267.119 --> 3273.2000000000003
weight difference so

3270.16 --> 3276.5589999999997
there you go because it's all

3273.2 --> 3281.04
dependent on yeah the relative the

3276.559 --> 3281.0400000000004
relative density differential

3290.4 --> 3294.88
it's not conspiracy what are you

3292.64 --> 3296.64
blabbering about

3294.88 --> 3298.2400000000002
what what does that have to do with a

3296.64 --> 3299.2799999999997
freaking conspiracy it's just a

3298.24 --> 3301.1189999999997
misconception

3299.28 --> 3302.6400000000003
based on the misunderstanding of the

3301.119 --> 3306.0
convention of weight

3302.64 --> 3310.0789999999997
it's not a conspiracy idiot

3306.0 --> 3313.2
that's fact you can look it up yourself

3310.079 --> 3317.8390000000004
you can trace it back through actual

3313.2 --> 3322.5589999999997
written works not just googling it

3317.839 --> 3322.5589999999997
actual books and [ __ ] right

3327.359 --> 3331.359
the scientific explanation it's relative

3330.48 --> 3333.28
density

3331.359 --> 3335.04
that's it the workings of relative

3333.28 --> 3337.76
density

3335.04 --> 3340.4
relative density can be formulated in a

3337.76 --> 3343.3590000000004
scientific experiment it has

3340.4 --> 3345.2000000000003
tony sleeping warrior has performed the

3343.359 --> 3348.04
experiment on camera

3345.2 --> 3349.2799999999997
formulated the hypothesis did the

3348.04 --> 3351.68
experimentation

3349.28 --> 3352.559
and you can do it yourself it's proof

3351.68 --> 3354.8799999999997
it's there i

3352.559 --> 3356.88
simply elaborated the understanding of

3354.88 --> 3360.0
the natural consequences and the

3356.88 --> 3363.28
more yeah the complicated mechanics

3360.0 --> 3366.64
of it all i just got a better oversight

3363.28 --> 3369.6800000000003
but that experiment that scientifically

3366.64 --> 3372.16
valid experiment has been

3369.68 --> 3372.96
established and performed you could do

3372.16 --> 3377.2
it yourself

3372.96 --> 3380.0
there's your scientific foundation

3377.2 --> 3382.8799999999997
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here you

3380.0 --> 3382.88
[ __ ] troll

3384.96 --> 3391.839
go squirt somewhere else

3396.97 --> 3400.1899999999996
[Music]

3403.63 --> 3410.1600000000003
[Music]

3406.319 --> 3410.64
earth is flat [ __ ] we can't handle this

3410.16 --> 3413.92
then

3410.64 --> 3418.48
piss off go circle jerky or [ __ ]

3413.92 --> 3420.16
somewhere else

3418.48 --> 3421.839
there's plenty of people here that can't

3420.16 --> 3424.64
handle it and they're not

3421.839 --> 3427.119
just gonna go full [ __ ] on me whenever

3424.64 --> 3430.16
i say something

3427.119 --> 3431.119
it's not you and that's why you are out

3430.16 --> 3433.839
of here

3431.119 --> 3433.839
get

3448.64 --> 3454.0
that's right samson yeah i elaborately

3452.0 --> 3455.839
explained about this and it is true

3454.0 --> 3457.04
weight is a convention you have air

3455.839 --> 3458.96
weight

3457.04 --> 3460.5589999999997
you have water weight and you have a

3458.96 --> 3462.64
vacuum weight

3460.559 --> 3465.28
because it's a convention based on a

3462.64 --> 3465.2799999999997
specific

3465.68 --> 3471.359
pressure of medium that's pretty much

3468.48 --> 3471.359
what it comes down to

3472.48 --> 3477.44
it's the the collected mass the the

3475.599 --> 3480.6400000000003
pressure of the mass

3477.44 --> 3483.68
registered in quantity variation in a

3480.64 --> 3486.96
quantity variety

3483.68 --> 3488.0
based on the disequilibrium within a

3486.96 --> 3490.799
specific

3488.0 --> 3491.2
medium setting with with regular weight

3490.799 --> 3493.839
is

3491.2 --> 3495.1189999999997
air pressure standard air pressure at

3493.839 --> 3496.72
sea level

3495.119 --> 3498.96
that's what weight is that's the

3496.72 --> 3500.64
convention of weight now if you don't

3498.96 --> 3504.16
understand that

3500.64 --> 3507.2799999999997
it's not my freaking problem if you've

3504.16 --> 3510.5589999999997
latched onto the idea of weight

3507.28 --> 3513.2000000000003
through newtonian mechanics or whatever

3510.559 --> 3514.2400000000002
which is completely refi refined

3513.2 --> 3516.799
nonsense

3514.24 --> 3517.9199999999996
and is outdated anyway that's your

3516.799 --> 3521.52
freaking problem

3517.92 --> 3524.7200000000003
if you want to just get that corpse

3521.52 --> 3526.64
out of out of the ground and try to

3524.72 --> 3528.48
make an argument with it that's not my

3526.64 --> 3532.0789999999997
problem i know what weight is

3528.48 --> 3532.559
exactly what it is i basically defined

3532.079 --> 3536.319
it

3532.559 --> 3539.0400000000004
to in in detail

3536.319 --> 3539.839
so that the misunderstandings concerning

3539.04 --> 3542.96
weight can be

3539.839 --> 3542.96
got ridden off

3543.04 --> 3559.839
for everybody that cares

3569.52 --> 3576.64
oh look we get another one

3573.599 --> 3578.0
yeah wild stuff yeah reality is wild

3576.64 --> 3580.5589999999997
stuff

3578.0 --> 3580.559
that's right

3584.72 --> 3588.16
better get your act together

3588.319 --> 3593.359
the nonsense dream is not viable

3596.96 --> 3601.839
now if you want to hold on to it that's

3599.119 --> 3604.48
fine you can dream about whatever the

3601.839 --> 3607.52
[ __ ] you want buddy

3604.48 --> 3615.839
but don't expect the world to to be

3607.52 --> 3615.839
forced into your stupid little dream

3615.92 --> 3624.2400000000002
you know i still dream about

3619.04 --> 3627.2799999999997
the whole thing about space conceptions

3624.24 --> 3630.64
not literally dream dream but i

3627.28 --> 3632.88
think about it pretty pretty yeah a lot

3630.64 --> 3632.8799999999997
of it

3633.04 --> 3641.04
i just do i like it but i'm not

3636.4 --> 3644.1600000000003
going to convolute things for myself

3641.04 --> 3646.16
by giving of the impression

3644.16 --> 3648.5589999999997
towards others and myself that it might

3646.16 --> 3652.48
actually be real

3648.559 --> 3655.6800000000003
i just understand much better the power

3652.48 --> 3655.68
of imagination

3655.839 --> 3662.5589999999997
and with that the responsibility of it

3659.28 --> 3662.559
because it is a power

3663.04 --> 3667.52
if you're really effective with it and

3666.16 --> 3670.0
with power becomes

3667.52 --> 3672.319
responsibility so just if you can have

3670.0 --> 3675.52
this glorious dream does it mean that

3672.319 --> 3678.079
you should just be drowning in that all

3675.52 --> 3678.079
your life

3680.0 --> 3685.839
that's called default

3688.799 --> 3697.04
yeah and defaulters typically end up in

3693.599 --> 3713.67
very bad places so we are

3697.04 --> 3716.0
all learning right now

3713.67 --> 3727.839
[Music]

3716.0 --> 3727.839
damn it i'm out of tea

3729.839 --> 3741.839
who is that agm

3746.4 --> 3755.839
okay uh are we met a ramistan stone

3764.24 --> 3771.0389999999998
but that makes sense

3768.4 --> 3771.92
well it's just about managing your

3771.039 --> 3776.2400000000002
feelings and

3771.92 --> 3782.319
and your soul versus your activity

3776.24 --> 3784.799
with your intellect and your imagination

3782.319 --> 3786.5589999999997
and if you just try to escape in your

3784.799 --> 3791.0389999999998
activity

3786.559 --> 3794.8390000000004
and pollute your soul then yeah

3791.039 --> 3797.8390000000004
then it's gonna end up [ __ ] when you

3794.839 --> 3797.839
default

3798.96 --> 3811.839
that's right balance absolutely a rest

3801.92 --> 3811.839
ahead by the way

3824.64 --> 3827.1189999999997
you know what

3831.359 --> 3839.839
what do you mean rest ahead

3834.559 --> 3839.8390000000004
what what's going

3850.839 --> 3853.839
on

3860.559 --> 3867.8390000000004
all right i i thank you

3864.839 --> 3867.839
uh

3868.4 --> 3871.44
i appreciate that

3872.48 --> 3876.0
how's the netherlands government

3877.52 --> 3884.24
it's not that great

3880.88 --> 3886.7200000000003
but it's not as bad as i could imagine

3884.24 --> 3886.72
it to be

3886.96 --> 3892.559
could get a lot worse but yeah we are

3889.76 --> 3895.5200000000004
tense here there's just a lot of

3892.559 --> 3909.8390000000004
resistance against the nonsense much

3895.52 --> 3909.839
more verbal

3916.559 --> 3923.8390000000004
he did hey jim okay did you meet him in

3919.2 --> 3923.839
person or something

3938.24 --> 3951.839
all right

3964.559 --> 3968.48
any forceful actions taken to implement

3966.799 --> 3973.0389999999998
covet stuff

3968.48 --> 3974.799
no there is a lot of media

3973.039 --> 3976.88
nonsense but that's because yeah the

3974.799 --> 3979.359
netherlands has been

3976.88 --> 3981.839
has a super liberal media has been for

3979.359 --> 3983.68
some time like even in the obama era

3981.839 --> 3985.119
literally the tv would just have

3983.68 --> 3988.0789999999997
constant worship

3985.119 --> 3989.6800000000003
[ __ ] over obama was absolutely

3988.079 --> 3993.8390000000004
disgusting

3989.68 --> 3993.839
that's been like that for a while

3994.96 --> 3998.88
and they're definitely trying to make us

3997.599 --> 4000.48
panic over covet

3998.88 --> 4004.319
as much as they can i don't even watch

4000.48 --> 4006.799
it anymore i just know it's gotta be bad

4004.319 --> 4008.72
and everybody's constantly discussing in

4006.799 --> 4011.2
the details should we do this should we

4008.72 --> 4020.3999999999996
do that what that what

4011.2 --> 4022.5589999999997
endless arguments with the commoners

4020.4 --> 4024.48
but as for actual forceful action

4022.559 --> 4027.599
implementations no no that

4024.48 --> 4031.52
that's not it's all been voluntary based

4027.599 --> 4033.119
sort of like some people

4031.52 --> 4036.72
i think there have been like some

4033.119 --> 4036.7200000000003
arrests and [ __ ] but it's just

4037.28 --> 4041.2000000000003
you don't exactly know what it is

4046.079 --> 4049.8390000000004
sometimes i think they're just using

4047.839 --> 4051.68
covet as an excuse to take

4049.839 --> 4053.7599999999998
care of people that were like

4051.68 --> 4054.5589999999997
troublemakers for some time or something

4053.76 --> 4056.88
maybe in that

4054.559 --> 4059.28
i don't know man i think covet is

4056.88 --> 4063.839
worldwide being used as an excuse for

4059.28 --> 4063.8390000000004
all kinds of things

4064.64 --> 4072.48
but there have been protests here

4067.68 --> 4072.48
definitely and

4074.4 --> 4078.88
there's also been pushback especially

4077.76 --> 4080.48
against protest

4078.88 --> 4082.6400000000003
like at one point they even put the

4080.48 --> 4086.0
military

4082.64 --> 4090.4
against the protesters pretty ridiculous

4086.0 --> 4094.319
but yeah there's no yeah no terrible

4090.4 --> 4094.319
riots or anything as far as i know

4101.759 --> 4110.319
oh god rest ahead what

4106.239 --> 4110.3189999999995
the [ __ ] oh

4111.88 --> 4114.88
righty-dokey

4116.839 --> 4119.839
sure

4128.96 --> 4135.52
not starting yes no but you're certainly

4132.4 --> 4139.12
steering the [ __ ]

4135.52 --> 4141.279
but who knows man i've heard you make

4139.12 --> 4142.239
wilder predictions i don't know i don't

4141.279 --> 4145.6
really

4142.239 --> 4148.4
like the person in

4145.6 --> 4151.279
in this question right there but i'm not

4148.4 --> 4153.599999999999
gonna go as far as to just say that

4151.279 --> 4153.6
why

4154.719 --> 4161.839
is i don't know eventually everything

4158.319 --> 4161.839000000001
will be revealed

4168.56 --> 4175.839000000001
yeah you know you are arrested

4200.84 --> 4206.0
right

4203.679 --> 4207.76
damn it i want more tea and it's out i'm

4206.0 --> 4209.52
on the tea

4207.76 --> 4212.400000000001
i have to really go for another 20

4209.52 --> 4212.400000000001
minutes without tea

4214.84 --> 4217.84
damn

4221.04 --> 4228.84
really i thought it was a

4225.36 --> 4231.839999999999
sarcastic troll comment there for a

4228.84 --> 4233.76
second

4231.84 --> 4245.84
well that's quite a compliment there

4233.76 --> 4245.84
tech transformation

4246.64 --> 4251.52
go make it yeah but before before i

4249.92 --> 4254.2390000000005
actually get the tea it's good

4251.52 --> 4255.4400000000005
well i could do it maybe i needed like a

4254.239 --> 4259.839999999999
toilet break too

4255.44 --> 4259.839999999999
okay i'll be back

4354.84 --> 4357.84
so

4396.84 --> 4399.84
yo

4401.95 --> 4405.0689999999995
[Music]

4406.48 --> 4413.12
oh my god martin tolberg

4409.92 --> 4416.56
that's sick

4413.12 --> 4427.84
binge 72 hours of sky news

4416.56 --> 4427.84
really dude

4430.2 --> 4438.13
[Music]

4438.84 --> 4441.84
so

4447.92 --> 4452.4
ah that's a good one aramis done stone

4450.64 --> 4455.76
indeed

4452.4 --> 4459.44
it's like the radius mathematically

4455.76 --> 4463.679
reified and they've been caught

4459.44 --> 4463.678999999999
right so now it's just like this

4464.159 --> 4471.28
weaponized rumor that just won't go away

4467.52 --> 4473.6
it's being reinforced constantly

4471.28 --> 4476.5599999999995
like a spell yeah that's they used to

4473.6 --> 4476.56
call that a spell

4477.12 --> 4483.84
like hundreds of years ago

4502.0 --> 4511.84
yeah mind control yeah that's another

4503.679 --> 4511.84
way to define it

4528.08 --> 4533.04
um well i ramistan stone it's

4530.32 --> 4535.5199999999995
interesting because

4533.04 --> 4537.12
mind control is really about

4535.52 --> 4540.64
surrendering right

4537.12 --> 4544.5599999999995
so the more society basically

4540.64 --> 4544.56
allows people to surrender

4545.04 --> 4552.719
the more mind control becomes important

4548.239 --> 4556.159
for those people that surrender to it

4552.719 --> 4559.12
so it was always there

4556.159 --> 4563.36
it's just that now is the time where a

4559.12 --> 4563.36
lot of people are basically becoming

4564.56 --> 4572.159000000001
derailed enough that

4568.4 --> 4574.799999999999
the average susceptibility has gone up

4572.159 --> 4574.799999999999
compared to

4575.679 --> 4578.4800000000005
i don't know when

4579.28 --> 4583.599999999999
or maybe it was always there

4583.92 --> 4588.32
and we're just now becoming more aware

4586.32 --> 4591.92
of it because of the information

4588.32 --> 4593.679
or age which is definitely making quite

4591.92 --> 4597.04
a lot of difference

4593.679 --> 4597.52
the well-structured ideas being spread

4597.04 --> 4600.32
around

4597.52 --> 4601.040000000001
very very rapidly for everyone to take a

4600.32 --> 4604.239
look at

4601.04 --> 4609.84
and respond to that's

4604.239 --> 4609.839999999999
that made the whole game different

4634.84 --> 4637.84
right

4641.92 --> 4645.6
so that's interesting tech

4643.6 --> 4648.4800000000005
transformation

4645.6 --> 4649.04
i've never really thought about it like

4648.48 --> 4653.28
that

4649.04 --> 4656.56
for me paradigm shifts tend to

4653.28 --> 4658.5599999999995
either happen instantly and then i'm

4656.56 --> 4660.4800000000005
basically dealing with the strain of it

4658.56 --> 4662.56
for a while

4660.48 --> 4664.0
or it just won't really come through and

4662.56 --> 4666.8
then it can take

4664.0 --> 4666.8
a lifetime

4669.6 --> 4679.84
it all depends on how much weight it has

4672.719 --> 4679.84
through your ego on you

4692.08 --> 4695.12
my internet was 10 years in a prison

4694.56 --> 4698.96
library

4695.12 --> 4698.96
okay well

4699.679 --> 4707.84
at least some time well spent

4718.84 --> 4721.84
hmm

4732.84 --> 4735.84
so

4746.84 --> 4750.400000000001
so

4748.08 --> 4750.4
hmm

4754.0 --> 4758.48
wow that sounds really sad george

4756.88 --> 4763.84
sanford are you sure

4758.48 --> 4763.839999999999
i mean here we go again are you sure

4766.32 --> 4777.84
like is everything really close

4790.08 --> 4794.239
and no i have not seen that documentary

4793.04 --> 4805.84
martin tolberg

4794.239 --> 4805.839999999999
the social dilemma

4809.84 --> 4819.84
all right i don't get it

4813.04 --> 4819.84
so catch it

4832.48 --> 4835.12
wow he had

4837.199 --> 4842.4
i don't get why people then don't just

4839.92 --> 4846.2390000000005
start organizing their own things

4842.4 --> 4848.638999999999
but i think some are

4846.239 --> 4849.759999999999
because it it is kind of like the

4848.639 --> 4854.159000000001
opportunity for

4849.76 --> 4854.159000000001
morse street artisan re

4854.88 --> 4861.84
this is like artistry i mean yeah

4863.679 --> 4870.159
and just like i don't know

4866.8 --> 4871.76
is it illegal to to just have a mobile

4870.159 --> 4874.32
stand like a bike

4871.76 --> 4875.76
type of thing and just fill it up with

4874.32 --> 4878.719
drinks and then

4875.76 --> 4878.719
sell that to people

4879.04 --> 4881.5199999999995
i don't know

4882.239 --> 4887.36
you know i'm just trying to figure out a

4886.639 --> 4890.32
way through

4887.36 --> 4890.719
you know i think that because it's all

4890.32 --> 4894.48
so

4890.719 --> 4896.32
weird and technical how it all works

4894.48 --> 4898.4
shouldn't it be possible to basically

4896.32 --> 4899.5199999999995
just bypass all these things that you've

4898.4 --> 4904.799999999999
taken for granted

4899.52 --> 4908.0
and just recreate it

4904.8 --> 4917.84
yourselves from another angle like that

4908.0 --> 4917.84
mobile stands and [ __ ]

4920.48 --> 4925.759999999999
or yeah i know what's the worst that

4923.84 --> 4926.4800000000005
could happen like oh the police corona

4925.76 --> 4929.280000000001
police come

4926.48 --> 4931.839999999999
okay well you just close up and drive

4929.28 --> 4931.84
away

4956.84 --> 4959.84
hmm

4962.49 --> 4965.59
[Music]

4975.28 --> 4983.84
well finding people

4979.28 --> 4983.84
well that's that's why you then go away

4984.719 --> 4990.159
you know

4987.84 --> 4991.679
you can i don't know i'm not too sure

4990.159 --> 4994.4
about it but

4991.679 --> 4995.12
a fine like they can't technically even

4994.4 --> 4997.679
find you

4995.12 --> 5000.8
if they don't have your identity now

4997.679 --> 5003.92
that can be risky

5000.8 --> 5006.639
not recommending to do that but

5003.92 --> 5009.04
it's also technical i think there's ways

5006.639 --> 5009.04
to just

5012.0 --> 5018.8
yeah be more mobile just stay ahead of

5015.84 --> 5018.8
stay ahead of them

5019.6 --> 5025.120000000001
like oh the corona police ready to

5023.12 --> 5027.199
spoil all the fun and scatter all the

5025.12 --> 5031.28
people okay

5027.199 --> 5033.919999999999
you just migrate to the next place

5031.28 --> 5035.44
this is just go somewhere else oh you

5033.92 --> 5038.4800000000005
don't want to go okay

5035.44 --> 5038.48
go somewhere else then

5038.639 --> 5042.400000000001
i don't know maybe it's impractical i'm

5041.679 --> 5057.84
just

5042.4 --> 5057.839999999999
spitballing here with ideas

5077.28 --> 5081.92
no cameron gilmore nothing no

5082.239 --> 5086.08
the only thing that's get messy is the

5084.159 --> 5087.44
crackdowns that's the only thing that's

5086.08 --> 5090.08
messy about the whole

5087.44 --> 5090.08
scenario

5092.88 --> 5099.84
oh for my team

5121.82 --> 5127.84
[Music]

5124.84 --> 5127.84
brilliant

5166.84 --> 5169.84
so

5180.84 --> 5183.84
so

5194.84 --> 5200.88
tadao

5197.76 --> 5203.1990000000005
fear of tax in the news well if they're

5200.88 --> 5206.2390000000005
gonna unroll

5203.199 --> 5209.759999999999
the again

5206.239 --> 5213.919999999999
uh basic income

5209.76 --> 5217.360000000001
all that yeah

5213.92 --> 5222.08
there's going to be a lot taxation like

5217.36 --> 5222.08
pretty quickly based on that

5222.32 --> 5228.08
and look guys there's a lot of

5225.84 --> 5230.08
controversy about the conception of

5228.08 --> 5234.0
basic income

5230.08 --> 5236.159
now as a concept as a concept

5234.0 --> 5237.44
it's actually pretty smart it's pretty

5236.159 --> 5240.719
good but

5237.44 --> 5245.28
here's the big big fat ass

5240.719 --> 5248.639
butt big fat ass butt right

5245.28 --> 5250.4
it kind of demands that things are under

5248.639 --> 5254.0
control

5250.4 --> 5255.679
if you don't have a good understanding

5254.0 --> 5258.96
of the people

5255.679 --> 5262.2390000000005
and people are not set

5258.96 --> 5264.56
that receive this set to

5262.239 --> 5266.08
just helping out doing good if that's

5264.56 --> 5269.1990000000005
not there if it's basically

5266.08 --> 5270.0
subjected to an immoral society or a

5269.199 --> 5273.719
polluted

5270.0 --> 5277.199
morally polluted society then it will

5273.719 --> 5281.92
absolutely trash it

5277.199 --> 5281.919999999999
it's a big big fat ass butt

5282.159 --> 5286.159
and i think that's the way they kind of

5284.08 --> 5290.639
want to force it through to basically

5286.159 --> 5292.4
aggravate the yeah the marxist roots

5290.639 --> 5296.400000000001
even worse to expand

5292.4 --> 5299.04
that because they will latch on to that

5296.4 --> 5302.638999999999
like the first that they will

5299.04 --> 5303.92
immediately latch on to that

5302.639 --> 5306.719
because they're already used to that

5303.92 --> 5309.84
tech to socialism

5306.719 --> 5313.44
systems like that and yeah

5309.84 --> 5313.4400000000005
as long as the country is not

5313.52 --> 5318.56
just properly united and has an

5316.48 --> 5319.839999999999
understanding of their borders and that

5318.56 --> 5322.0
they should be

5319.84 --> 5323.6
working on the country and basically

5322.0 --> 5326.88
it's a gift

5323.6 --> 5329.84
that is there for the i guess

5326.88 --> 5329.84
restoration

5330.32 --> 5335.28
grassroots restorations in a way but

5332.639 --> 5340.08
because of the entire setup it's just

5335.28 --> 5340.08
it this is not the time

5340.96 --> 5343.92
it's not the time

5346.8 --> 5350.0
and besides they're literally pushing it

5348.96 --> 5352.88
through they're causing

5350.0 --> 5356.0
economic damage and then giving this as

5352.88 --> 5359.4400000000005
an alternative you can't get a worse

5356.0 --> 5359.44
reason for introducing it

5362.639 --> 5365.76
because it's just that slavery this way

5365.36 --> 5369.28
now

5365.76 --> 5372.88
it's just a giant corporate

5369.28 --> 5378.48
government media move to literally cause

5372.88 --> 5382.08
a new wave of indentured servitude

5378.48 --> 5382.08
it's not the first time that happened

5390.639 --> 5395.4400000000005
well george sanford again basic income

5393.76 --> 5397.4400000000005
is degrading of humans no pride and

5395.44 --> 5399.759999999999
self-worth well that's all depending on

5397.44 --> 5399.759999999999
how

5400.96 --> 5404.159
all depends on how

5404.96 --> 5408.159
if it's going to be introduced in a

5407.199 --> 5411.199
system where you

5408.159 --> 5411.679
literally can't do anything you cannot

5411.199 --> 5415.759999999999
grow

5411.679 --> 5418.96
out of that position with what you get

5415.76 --> 5422.0
yeah then it's absolutely [ __ ]

5418.96 --> 5424.96
but if it's really an honest

5422.0 --> 5426.96
attempt to basically prevent people from

5424.96 --> 5429.28
going into criminality because they

5426.96 --> 5432.4800000000005
don't need to to survive

5429.28 --> 5435.679
then it's actually kind of good but

5432.48 --> 5437.5199999999995
yeah scenario who are in control

5435.679 --> 5440.2390000000005
how are they planning with it this is

5437.52 --> 5440.2390000000005
not the time

5443.52 --> 5448.719
such things should only be introduced in

5446.239 --> 5452.08
stable situations

5448.719 --> 5455.36
not this because then hostile

5452.08 --> 5460.4
intent intended forces will literally

5455.36 --> 5460.4
use it to the maximum benefit it's

5460.84 --> 5463.84
terrible

5469.44 --> 5477.839999999999
does anybody get me here

5485.199 --> 5488.879999999999
anybody anybody

5489.36 --> 5492.5599999999995
right kevin horizons

5498.47 --> 5505.1990000000005
[Music]

5501.199 --> 5508.96
right so i'm not against it it's just a

5505.199 --> 5512.799999999999
it's a form of micromanaging a sort of

5508.96 --> 5515.44
it's damn it how do you explain this

5512.8 --> 5518.8
it's an option it's a system it's just

5515.44 --> 5522.32
it requires stability

5518.8 --> 5525.6
or hostile forces

5522.32 --> 5532.0
will use it against the stability so

5525.6 --> 5536.719
that's pretty much the gist of it

5532.0 --> 5536.719
i hope this will be received

5538.56 --> 5542.320000000001
not just by you guys but also

5544.84 --> 5549.6
universally

5547.679 --> 5551.12
you know you don't always have to say

5549.6 --> 5552.96
bad it's always bad

5551.12 --> 5555.44
this is always good no that's not how

5552.96 --> 5558.96
things work that's

5555.44 --> 5560.0
now in this specific scenario in another

5558.96 --> 5565.44
scenario it will

5560.0 --> 5565.44
not be that and that matters

5566.48 --> 5570.5599999999995
because otherwise all these things what

5568.8 --> 5573.1990000000005
government could now be doing

5570.56 --> 5574.0
is basically introducing good concepts

5573.199 --> 5576.799999999999
and then

5574.0 --> 5579.12
ritually publicly rape them so that

5576.8 --> 5580.08
everybody will hate them and utterly

5579.12 --> 5583.5199999999995
reject it

5580.08 --> 5586.84
once they lose grip

5583.52 --> 5590.719
final mind control

5586.84 --> 5590.719
damage you understand

5591.199 --> 5595.678999999999
everybody's freaking savage what do you

5593.92 --> 5598.719
think is going to happen

5595.679 --> 5603.92
nothing people will all become

5598.719 --> 5603.92
miserable paranoid and illusion

5604.0 --> 5607.84
got to take things exactly what they are

5605.92 --> 5608.2390000000005
see what they are doing they are using

5607.84 --> 5612.400000000001
good

5608.239 --> 5615.36
things in bad ways to rape

5612.4 --> 5616.32
those concepts for the public

5615.36 --> 5618.5599999999995
consciousness

5616.32 --> 5620.08
so that they will learn to hate those

5618.56 --> 5631.84
concepts and not the one

5620.08 --> 5631.84
abusing the concepts

5638.56 --> 5645.84
yeah they're always trying to shift the

5642.84 --> 5645.84
blame

5651.76 --> 5658.0
it's a passive control of our

5653.12 --> 5661.84
subcultures and the way we live

5658.0 --> 5664.56
maybe well the thing is you know you can

5661.84 --> 5665.52
reject it it's not like you're forced to

5664.56 --> 5667.92
take it

5665.52 --> 5670.4800000000005
it's just an option just like social

5667.92 --> 5670.4800000000005
welfare

5670.84 --> 5673.84
so

5677.679 --> 5680.96
what is my mind's vulnerability well

5680.56 --> 5682.96
i've

5680.96 --> 5684.88
thrown every vulnerability out there

5682.96 --> 5688.2390000000005
every vulnerability i have

5684.88 --> 5688.2390000000005
is my biggest strength

5699.44 --> 5717.898999999999
that sounds quite cryptic i know

5714.78 --> 5717.898999999999
[Music]

5737.119 --> 5743.04
it's not an option when they force it

5739.28 --> 5745.84
with punitive consequences

5743.04 --> 5749.44
all right well then then it's not really

5745.84 --> 5753.84
basic income anymore now is it

5749.44 --> 5757.678999999999
then it's just autocracy and handing you

5753.84 --> 5759.52
a feed trough that's not

5757.679 --> 5761.119
universal basically that's not the

5759.52 --> 5763.84
foundational philosophy

5761.119 --> 5766.639
behind universal basic income because it

5763.84 --> 5766.639
does have that

5766.8 --> 5770.8
i'm not super well versed in all that

5769.92 --> 5773.28
but i

5770.8 --> 5774.8
was interested when the ideas first came

5773.28 --> 5778.4
around

5774.8 --> 5782.0
and i have considered it in

5778.4 --> 5784.48
just to learn but yeah if there's all

5782.0 --> 5786.4
these conditional shitty rules

5784.48 --> 5788.48
especially political ones yeah then it's

5786.4 --> 5790.08
not universal basic income anymore then

5788.48 --> 5792.879999999999
it just becomes

5790.08 --> 5794.96
autocracy mind control with a free

5792.88 --> 5797.28
feeding trough

5794.96 --> 5798.56
then it'll be used to tame in prison

5797.28 --> 5800.5599999999995
cattle

5798.56 --> 5802.8
that's not what universal basic income

5800.56 --> 5802.8
is

5803.199 --> 5807.04
they do that it's just straight out

5805.76 --> 5809.76
autocracy

5807.04 --> 5809.76
that is like

5811.28 --> 5815.759999999999
i know i think that might go in

5813.28 --> 5827.84
directions of

5815.76 --> 5827.84
gulag mechanics

5838.84 --> 5841.84
hmm

5847.04 --> 5855.84
okay a room is done stone i don't know

5850.719 --> 5855.84
but very well

5866.84 --> 5869.84
hey

5875.76 --> 5879.6
now the package is non-critical i don't

5877.6 --> 5881.679
know about that

5879.6 --> 5884.159000000001
i don't completely understand what you

5881.679 --> 5887.63
are trying to convey

5884.159 --> 5890.829
a ramistan stone

5887.63 --> 5890.829
[Music]

5894.239 --> 5898.799999999999
right well samson you're you're totally

5897.52 --> 5902.56
right

5898.8 --> 5906.719
but maybe you should just call it

5902.56 --> 5908.719
law and policy because that is really

5906.719 --> 5910.639
what it comes down to and they are very

5908.719 --> 5914.639
different words and their words

5910.639 --> 5917.04
connect policy politics

5914.639 --> 5917.679
the way how they would like you to do

5917.04 --> 5920.48
things

5917.679 --> 5921.52
it's not rules law is law policy is

5920.48 --> 5924.799999999999
policy

5921.52 --> 5925.1990000000005
so i'd personally choose to divide those

5924.8 --> 5928.2390000000005
things

5925.199 --> 5931.599999999999
up into in those two words

5928.239 --> 5931.599999999999
just a suggestion of course

5932.88 --> 5937.28
because there's company policy there's

5935.04 --> 5937.679
police policy there's government policy

5937.28 --> 5941.04
there's

5937.679 --> 5944.32
building policy there is

5941.04 --> 5947.76
public policy but those are not laws

5944.32 --> 5950.239
it's just kind of suggested

5947.76 --> 5952.08
way to keep balance how to do things

5950.239 --> 5955.36
it's not

5952.08 --> 5958.8
forced forcible by law and

5955.36 --> 5962.4
peoples a lot of people especially in

5958.8 --> 5965.76
certain western countries are very easy

5962.4 --> 5968.5599999999995
to adapt to policy

5965.76 --> 5968.96
and that's why they kind of like overuse

5968.56 --> 5971.679
it

5968.96 --> 5972.88
because it just works so well on those

5971.679 --> 5976.08
people

5972.88 --> 5980.4800000000005
there's another group of people though

5976.08 --> 5983.5199999999995
slowly growing that don't

5980.48 --> 5987.199
do that as well yeah

5983.52 --> 5988.2390000000005
and those are the migrants they don't do

5987.199 --> 5991.919999999999
that

5988.239 --> 5992.959999999999
yeah so there's a long-term growing

5991.92 --> 5995.92
problem

5992.96 --> 5997.119
just from a management perspective

5995.92 --> 6000.08
because of the poor

5997.119 --> 6000.08
poor choices

6001.119 --> 6009.839999999999
of long-term big policy plans

6004.56 --> 6009.84
by by big governments

6018.8 --> 6022.0
but yeah the the western world has

6020.8 --> 6025.4400000000005
worked so well with

6022.0 --> 6027.84
policy system and just basically civil

6025.44 --> 6029.5199999999995
obedience like people want to obey

6027.84 --> 6030.08
because they want to do the right thing

6029.52 --> 6034.159000000001
they want

6030.08 --> 6036.0
good things it then worked fantastically

6034.159 --> 6039.28
we're great at it

6036.0 --> 6040.159
in my experience in the past but yeah

6039.28 --> 6043.679
now

6040.159 --> 6047.679
the ones giving that out

6043.679 --> 6050.719
are growing hostile they're no longer

6047.679 --> 6052.159
giving us policies that are actually

6050.719 --> 6054.32
good for us

6052.159 --> 6055.44
they're actually introducing policies

6054.32 --> 6059.5199999999995
that take away

6055.44 --> 6062.879999999999
from us that's the difference

6059.52 --> 6066.2390000000005
and people are just still still

6062.88 --> 6068.88
doing it they're like flustered because

6066.239 --> 6070.0
their default position worked so well

6068.88 --> 6073.04
for so long

6070.0 --> 6075.679
it worked entire lifetimes

6073.04 --> 6077.44
for certain generations and now they're

6075.679 --> 6080.2390000000005
all just

6077.44 --> 6082.48
like it's all gone they don't they don't

6080.239 --> 6084.4
know what to do

6082.48 --> 6086.159
they don't know how to compose anymore

6084.4 --> 6088.48
so they just

6086.159 --> 6090.32
kind of like lost and depressed just go

6088.48 --> 6093.5199999999995
along

6090.32 --> 6096.719
hope it'll be all right hope

6093.52 --> 6096.719
they will stop doing it

6097.04 --> 6100.159
it's very tragic

6105.04 --> 6108.4
and then again others including older

6107.44 --> 6112.0
people also

6108.4 --> 6112.719
sometimes sadly just snap out of it and

6112.0 --> 6116.88
just realize

6112.719 --> 6120.56
wait there's something really wrong here

6116.88 --> 6122.8
like i can't sit through this anymore

6120.56 --> 6123.6
so that is happening too it's not like

6122.8 --> 6126.8
they're all

6123.6 --> 6126.8
doomed thank god

6128.239 --> 6134.718999999999
