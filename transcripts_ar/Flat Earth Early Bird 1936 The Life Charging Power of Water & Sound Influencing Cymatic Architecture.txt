all

98.28 --> 107.04
that right weather again today

101.96 --> 109.759
is just like yesterday sunny and hot

107.04 --> 112.52000000000001
seems to be even less wind around now

109.759 --> 116.32
it's like almost wind still

112.52 --> 116.32
entirely let's see anything

116.479 --> 124.15899999999999
move all right so Sun bit hazy up there

121.759 --> 126.0
so I bet it's still plenty of moist in

124.159 --> 130.239
the

126.0 --> 130.239
air no trails that I've

131.0 --> 135.76
seen so yeah really feels like a summer

141.92 --> 148.55999999999997
day hello day and night first in chat

145.92 --> 151.83999999999997
debatable D was there earlier and so was

148.56 --> 151.84
Gary Fe

152.879 --> 160.0
starting just a little late because I

154.84 --> 163.56
was kind of distracted watching a video

160.0 --> 163.56
presentation of D

164.04 --> 167.76
live MC dirty

168.8 --> 173.28
work and that thing just lasting

173.76 --> 180.76
forever started 3 hours

176.599 --> 184.599
ago but yeah I was awake pretty early 3

180.76 --> 187.39999999999998
hours ago so I watched most of it it's

184.599 --> 187.39999999999998
been very

187.64 --> 193.11999999999998
interesting and inspired me to start out

190.799 --> 193.12
with a

194.64 --> 201.04
title right cuz it's all

201.799 --> 209.08
about ancient architecture and what is

205.48 --> 211.07999999999998
considered to be tartaria the old

209.08 --> 212.519
buildings and structures that have been

211.08 --> 215.72
kind of

212.519 --> 218.31900000000002
removed partially and being covered up

215.72 --> 221.599
and their original

218.319 --> 224.51899999999998
functions forgotten

221.599 --> 228.159
and all

224.519 --> 228.159
that it's really

233.28 --> 239.319
interesting second in the chat I didn't

236.76 --> 242.12
see the first one the bable D so I don't

239.319 --> 242.11999999999998
know what just talking

242.439 --> 251.48
about uh what time David wi interview

245.959 --> 251.48
tomorrow uh 8 p.m. Amsterdam

251.72 --> 257.319
time but uh yeah there I will have a

258.759 --> 265.6
uh just like I'm doing with my early

262.16 --> 267.88000000000005
word shows it will be there tomorrow

265.6 --> 270.88
like guess yeah it will be there

267.88 --> 270.88
available

278.0 --> 283.0
so you'll be able to get in there before

280.56 --> 286.12
it starts with the timer countdown and

283.0 --> 286.12
everything don't worry about

290.0 --> 294.68
it it be a late night bird

296.16 --> 301.639
no will be a night owl show but it will

299.039 --> 301.639
still be like

307.8 --> 311.6
before comment disappeared okay well

310.199 --> 315.16
they they removed

311.6 --> 318.96000000000004
it and it's no point avable D

315.16 --> 323.03900000000004
because if you are saying hello before I

318.96 --> 323.039
start the show you're not first in

325.6 --> 330.44
chat that's not how this works

334.84 --> 338.44
that's so

335.84 --> 342.75899999999996
warm can't wait for it to cool down a

338.44 --> 342.759
bit it's been very warm here

385.68 --> 389.639
let's take a look around

408.28 --> 411.28
h

428.84 --> 434.56
the show just say no no debatable D I

432.0 --> 436.759
don't care I don't care for your

434.56 --> 439.84
reasoning it's not how that

436.759 --> 444.039
works yeah you're not going to tell me

439.84 --> 444.039
how I do my show

444.52 --> 449.75899999999996
okay first in chat is after the show

448.24 --> 452.96000000000004
starts

449.759 --> 452.96000000000004
and that's how it's going to

455.919 --> 461.919
be all right so yeah what I'm pondering

458.84 --> 463.96
about today is about what is claimed to

461.919 --> 466.96
be

463.96 --> 466.96
ether

469.56 --> 476.759
and well of course my physics based

473.319 --> 479.68
objections to it which still stand but

476.759 --> 481.28000000000003
then again there is like the the whole

479.68 --> 484.199
resonance

481.28 --> 487.11999999999995
question uh yeah and the influence of

484.199 --> 489.8
simatic structures mostly on water how

487.12 --> 491.919
it makes water alive how it creates

489.8 --> 495.199
magnetic fields which have a positive

491.919 --> 498.87899999999996
influence Etc I mean those are

495.199 --> 502.0
things that are provably there and even

498.879 --> 502.0
20th century

502.08 --> 507.68
scientists that are like or alternative

505.28 --> 511.31899999999996
Engineers have built things that

507.68 --> 511.319
basically back

511.759 --> 516.76
those

512.599 --> 516.76
systems and they are very

521.88 --> 524.88
interesting

528.64 --> 534.0
right but yeah I don't really I mean I

531.48 --> 536.6800000000001
could just like oh I'll just play the

534.0 --> 541.279
presentation

536.68 --> 543.16
then there's no real point to that

541.279 --> 546.519
it's not the first time this kind of

543.16 --> 546.519
subject has been brought up or

561.24 --> 568.76
anything you can do whatever you want

563.44 --> 568.7600000000001
debatable d i I don't care

575.959 --> 580.16
yeah don't tell me how to run my

586.24 --> 596.839
show catch any of the JIS in theate no

590.839 --> 596.839
why why would I catch that vatable d

603.76 --> 607.16
what debate at

626.279 --> 630.279
jism mun

638.279 --> 644.519
Jesus Dave S who's Dave Sovereign soul

663.279 --> 668.8389999999999
wow can't believe they actually invited

666.079 --> 668.8389999999999
flat soid

676.88 --> 681.72
over so never seen him

683.36 --> 689.0790000000001
before

685.079 --> 689.079
okay goodie

710.279 --> 715.32
yeah sounds like

712.399 --> 717.079
uh yeah I mean I I don't even want to

715.32 --> 719.6800000000001
check that out I mean

717.079 --> 722.6999999999999
this there's no way in hell hell that

719.68 --> 724.079
could ever be anything other than

722.7 --> 727.0790000000001
[Music]

724.079 --> 727.079
terrible

729.279 --> 733.4399999999999
so I mean I don't know who this Dave

731.639 --> 736.639
Sovereign soul is he might have been

733.44 --> 736.639
like halfway good

737.04 --> 741.8
but I mean if he'd agree to that

744.88 --> 750.56
lineup don't see a lot of good coming

747.199 --> 750.56
out of that

751.199 --> 754.3599999999999
spaghetti so

766.079 --> 772.2399999999999
what yeah who cares day night I mean

769.639 --> 772.24
they have bigger

775.36 --> 782.5600000000001
channels they cleared up the container

779.48 --> 782.5600000000001
hoop what does that

790.399 --> 796.8
mean brought good things to the table

793.519 --> 796.8
okay sure

797.76 --> 804.6
whatever could you be more specific I

800.6 --> 807.639
mean what you size up as good

804.6 --> 811.5600000000001
things well from a baller perspective

807.639 --> 814.48
that yeah that doesn't mean a lot really

811.56 --> 819.959
but if you could be more specific then I

814.48 --> 819.9590000000001
could basically say something about that

840.959 --> 847.04
but I mean if they just say hey water

842.72 --> 851.72
find its level that's pretty much

847.04 --> 851.7199999999999
already ball Earth killer

887.56 --> 893.279
right yeah flicking through some YouTube

890.88 --> 894.959
shorts I I did bump into like some

893.279 --> 897.279
really interesting

894.959 --> 899.079
stuff sometimes I bump into really

897.279 --> 901.04
interesting stuff so apparently there

899.079 --> 905.04
was

901.04 --> 908.079
this monor rail train that used giant

905.04 --> 910.759
gyroscopes to just stay perfectly

908.079 --> 912.959
stable that was in the

910.759 --> 917.24
1900s really

912.959 --> 917.2399999999999
fascinating little YouTube short about

918.04 --> 923.3199999999999
it also watch a longer video not a

923.639 --> 929.12
short Mel's hole like what the hell is

927.24 --> 931.36
that

929.12 --> 935.839
that sounds like it sounded like a

931.36 --> 939.92
really '90s level crazy conspiracy

935.839 --> 942.44
story but I mean holy [ __ ] the amount of

939.92 --> 946.4799999999999
things that are mentioned in that alone

942.44 --> 946.48
are just off the chart

947.199 --> 951.639
bizarre I'll leave you to find that for

952.12 --> 959.319
yourself but yeah any direct evidence of

956.839 --> 961.9200000000001
abandoned technology from the early 20th

959.319 --> 964.639
century is always fascinating and

961.92 --> 968.4399999999999
so just post that

964.639 --> 968.44
clip very interesting

974.279 --> 978.6899999999999
stuff they couldn't answer gas pressure

977.12 --> 979.92
in a container

978.69 --> 984.399
[Music]

979.92 --> 984.399
what what does that mean

1001.16 --> 1003.92
what are you talking

1007.44 --> 1012.6
about look if you guys are just here to

1011.0 --> 1016.279
to piss me

1012.6 --> 1019.6800000000001
off then yeah like what the hell are you

1016.279 --> 1023.04
even doing here

1019.68 --> 1023.04
hell FS good to see

1023.76 --> 1030.799
you I hear a lot of people saying jesus'

1026.6 --> 1034.1599999999999
name wasn't really Jesus yeah a lot of

1030.799 --> 1036.959
people say that fiber outs lots of them

1034.16 --> 1036.959
it doesn't really

1040.24 --> 1046.559
matter I mean the name does work like it

1044.72 --> 1050.48
doesn't matter whether that was the

1046.559 --> 1050.48
original name or not

1055.0 --> 1061.039
apologize unless what the [ __ ] are you

1058.16 --> 1061.039
talking about Gary

1064.919 --> 1072.44
a what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] about

1068.88 --> 1073.919
holding grudges for something I say yeah

1072.44 --> 1077.799
if you're like that then what the [ __ ]

1073.919 --> 1077.7990000000002
are you even doing here

1084.38 --> 1089.2
[Music]

1086.2 --> 1091.4
yeah fibr outs people have all kinds of

1089.2 --> 1095.88
opinions on

1091.4 --> 1095.88
that what not me

1096.32 --> 1102.84
okay is is that I've never heard Jesus

1099.52 --> 1102.84
say that

1119.559 --> 1125.72
Jarvis oh stepen Jarvis said something

1122.4 --> 1129.44
to you last week okay well next time if

1125.72 --> 1132.08
you say something like that mention the

1129.44 --> 1135.1200000000001
name you're talking

1132.08 --> 1139.48
about yeah generalized statements like

1135.12 --> 1139.4799999999998
that tend to be kind of confusing

1145.12 --> 1148.36
all right but F RS I

1150.36 --> 1154.1999999999998
mean these specific

1154.799 --> 1160.12
names like it is kind of pointless like

1157.84 --> 1163.3999999999999
it's not going to

1160.12 --> 1164.559
matter you say Jesus Christ that works

1163.4 --> 1167.2800000000002
just

1164.559 --> 1171.2
fine use it in the

1167.28 --> 1173.08
technique Jesus Christ works if you say

1171.2 --> 1175.52
when I say it in the Dark World it it

1173.08 --> 1178.12
matters like it doesn't matter like what

1175.52 --> 1180.28
supposed the originally your original

1178.12 --> 1182.9189999999999
name is because it's not it's not even

1180.28 --> 1182.9189999999999
about the

1184.96 --> 1189.64
name it's about what the name stands

1192.72 --> 1197.24
for

1194.36 --> 1200.7199999999998
right I mean somebody could be really

1197.24 --> 1204.64
dark and evil and

1200.72 --> 1206.44
basically mean the Devil With Jesus

1204.64 --> 1209.44
Christ if they're Twisted

1206.44 --> 1213.679
enough uh you will hear it in their

1209.44 --> 1215.48
voice how they say it that voice

1213.679 --> 1218.76
carries

1215.48 --> 1223.159
pollution and you feel it then they're

1218.76 --> 1223.1589999999999
effectively blaspheming they're

1223.44 --> 1229.799
misnaming

1226.44 --> 1231.4
right but you could literally just just

1229.799 --> 1235.6
make up a

1231.4 --> 1239.52
name as long as in your mind it ties

1235.6 --> 1239.52
into the

1240.2 --> 1247.0800000000002
original or story that is

1243.159 --> 1249.1200000000001
a directly connected to the original

1247.08 --> 1252.6789999999999
Jesus

1249.12 --> 1254.4399999999998
Christ not to the word but by what it's

1252.679 --> 1257.64
describing because that's happening all

1254.44 --> 1263.6000000000001
over the world it'll be effective

1257.64 --> 1263.6000000000001
because it's not about an assembly of

1267.679 --> 1271.64
sounds J didn't exist in Lang yeah

1270.48 --> 1276.2
that's right

1271.64 --> 1276.2
clutch but I mean it literally doesn't

1276.76 --> 1280.12
matter yeah I

1283.96 --> 1290.64
mean I bet like in Chinese or whatever

1287.64 --> 1293.039
they don't say the name Jesus like that

1290.64 --> 1295.039
either but it's still going to work

1293.039 --> 1298.679
because that's what they

1295.039 --> 1303.8799999999999
mean it's about what you mean when you

1298.679 --> 1303.88
invoke it not about how you pronounce

1317.52 --> 1321.559
it e

1358.52 --> 1367.48
Jesus is the Roman created

1360.96 --> 1367.48
version uh well it is clutch it

1368.12 --> 1373.4399999999998
is it is the Roman created version

1379.559 --> 1382.6789999999999
right it it doesn't really

1384.039 --> 1393.679
matter right we have our

1387.559 --> 1393.6789999999999
sources and the Romans took took it all

1394.64 --> 1401.3600000000001
over and they

1398.08 --> 1403.48
basically destroyed the original forms

1401.36 --> 1408.7199999999998
of

1403.48 --> 1408.72
Christianity and remade it

1410.72 --> 1414.0
hey F Ro good to see

1418.36 --> 1424.52
you right up for your watch

1424.84 --> 1431.6789999999999
what hey how did the meeting go

1428.279 --> 1435.52
yesterday fiber outs I mean I applied

1431.679 --> 1435.52
the technique you never got back to

1436.0 --> 1442.08

1618.279 --> 1620.64
welcome

1624.159 --> 1632.3200000000002
here right I mean I'm just like crawling

1629.48 --> 1636.32
out of the crisis period that I've been

1632.32 --> 1639.8799999999999
in pretty much all of April and a big

1636.32 --> 1639.8799999999999
chunk of March

1664.96 --> 1669.08
right so fibro if you don't want to give

1666.799 --> 1671.039
me feedback in this chat which I

1669.08 --> 1674.32
understand because it's full

1671.039 --> 1676.919
of people that

1674.32 --> 1678.6399999999999
are not all that

1676.919 --> 1681.72
trustworthy just

1678.64 --> 1681.72
talk to me in

1689.399 --> 1696.1999999999998
Skype but I mean it's kind of important

1692.64 --> 1696.2
feedback it's important for

1696.24 --> 1701.679
me trying to learn how to do this

1712.0 --> 1716.279
I don't understand well then you should

1714.12 --> 1720.08
have paid

1716.279 --> 1722.32
attention I mean I have show titles that

1720.08 --> 1725.48
are about the technique in which I

1722.32 --> 1725.48
explain about the

1736.519 --> 1744.2
technique yeah it's Like a Prayer

1741.12 --> 1748.4799999999998
system can heal over

1744.2 --> 1750.64
distance very specific way everybody all

1748.48 --> 1751.96
the trolls like to misinterpret that all

1750.64 --> 1753.76
the

1751.96 --> 1757.919
time

1753.76 --> 1757.919
just be a nuisance about

1760.88 --> 1767.279
it describe it is like the

1764.799 --> 1770.559
force that's kind of funny that you'd

1767.279 --> 1773.919
mention that g F because the force from

1770.559 --> 1776.76
Star Wars does seem to have

1773.919 --> 1780.88
like

1776.76 --> 1783.36
traits that do remind me of

1780.88 --> 1785.24
it especially like the psionic

1783.36 --> 1787.6
connection and all

1785.24 --> 1791.559
that that does not seem to have a

1787.6 --> 1793.84
distance limit although proximity like

1791.559 --> 1793.84
does

1794.08 --> 1800.799
enhance sensory connection within Star

1797.799 --> 1804.399
Wars or at least in the original

1800.799 --> 1806.08
movies in the sequels it seems like

1804.399 --> 1809.4799999999998
there's no distance

1806.08 --> 1809.48
limit just

1816.48 --> 1823.08
bizarre why take your phone off you

1820.08 --> 1823.08
what

1824.76 --> 1829.399
okay right well that shouldn't matter

1827.36 --> 1835.36
because I've been talking about it like

1829.399 --> 1835.36
3 months ago 4 months ago 5 months

1851.84 --> 1857.48
ago what's happening outside hello laser

1855.039 --> 1860.639
life nothing nothing is happening

1857.48 --> 1860.6390000000001
outside it's

1860.84 --> 1869.4399999999998
warm the sun is shining birds are

1865.2 --> 1872.919
chirping cats are lying in the shade

1869.44 --> 1872.919
everywhere and that's

1883.24 --> 1889.919
it right so don't forget to Rogan it up

1886.76 --> 1889.919
you're here

1891.24 --> 1894.039
and share the

1899.76 --> 1908.919
show George Lucas experienc the

1904.159 --> 1911.72
technique I doubt it but he's probably

1908.919 --> 1915.3200000000002
readed into

1911.72 --> 1915.32
just things like

1916.159 --> 1920.48
prayer I mean through

1918.48 --> 1922.519
Jewish religion there is such a thing as

1920.48 --> 1924.84
prayer and that thing also works over

1922.519 --> 1927.88
distance so like the technique is

1924.84 --> 1927.8799999999999
basically like

1946.84 --> 1950.8799999999999
prayer for

1981.639 --> 1984.84
all right

2017.96 --> 2024.24
right I've been thinking

2020.88 --> 2026.1200000000001
about the influence of resonance and

2024.24 --> 2029.72
simatics

2026.12 --> 2033.559
and like for example how Nathan built

2029.72 --> 2037.159
like all this sound neutralizing panels

2033.559 --> 2039.0
and all that how that will clarify

2037.159 --> 2042.3600000000001
stabilize his

2039.0 --> 2045.679
voice recordings and all that like that

2042.36 --> 2046.84
is basically like a a simatic influence

2045.679 --> 2051.2400000000002
but it is

2046.84 --> 2052.839
to minimize Echo and neutralize it I

2051.24 --> 2056.4399999999996
wonder if there's like other things that

2052.839 --> 2059.7599999999998
you could do other simatic

2056.44 --> 2062.52
shapes you could like put on the wall

2059.76 --> 2065.7200000000003
that would do other

2062.52 --> 2069.72
things with the

2065.72 --> 2069.72
sound hey hello culture

2290.52 --> 2296.0
extradimensional claims that involve it

of

2296.8 --> 2303.599
it ice that burns and like extracts

2301.8 --> 2306.04
water from the air and just keeps

2303.599 --> 2310.52
burning forever drying everything out

2306.04 --> 2313.48
like that's a weird set of stories that

2310.52 --> 2313.48
are involved in

2314.24 --> 2319.7999999999997
that including like

2317.319 --> 2323.68
Resurrection what the

2319.8 --> 2323.6800000000003
[ __ ] I bumped into

2326.0 --> 2331.359
that simatic structures yeah that's

2329.28 --> 2333.2000000000003
tartaria related I just put it in the

2331.359 --> 2335.5989999999997
title so I'd have something in the title

2333.2 --> 2337.5989999999997
maybe to stimulate people into pondering

2335.599 --> 2339.88
upon that

2337.599 --> 2342.44
right so and I talk about sematic

2339.88 --> 2345.6400000000003
structures talking about star fortresses

2342.44 --> 2350.2000000000003
for example or

2345.64 --> 2350.2
old spirograph church

2352.839 --> 2360.7999999999997
Windows sound and magnetic influences

2357.96 --> 2365.839
and

2360.8 --> 2365.8390000000004
water energizers basically

2369.359 --> 2376.56
that's disgusting culture cats it's not

2372.72 --> 2376.56
[ __ ] funny don't talk like

2377.68 --> 2383.64
that landfill no there is no

2380.839 --> 2385.64
fil and it's not called mels like he

2383.64 --> 2386.72
doesn't own that place anymore the

2385.64 --> 2391.72
government

2386.72 --> 2391.72
basically just stole it

2409.88 --> 2416.4
no you don't say you don't ask in German

2413.839 --> 2419.64
cons

2416.4 --> 2422.92
do that's not proper

2419.64 --> 2425.839
German you forgot the

2422.92 --> 2429.4
word yeah and yeah I understand the

2425.839 --> 2433.319
accent I can emulate German it's

2429.4 --> 2435.359
just I'm not a fluent German speaker but

2433.319 --> 2438.839
I'm pretty sure that if I'd live there

2435.359 --> 2440.44
for like a year i' I'd get the hang of

2438.839 --> 2445.319
it pretty

2440.44 --> 2449.8
quickly it is very close to the Dutch in

2445.319 --> 2453.599
ways it's like and close to English so

2449.8 --> 2455.1600000000003
it is like the second easiest language

2453.599 --> 2459.2000000000003
for me to figure

2455.16 --> 2462.0
out if German people are talking I can

2459.2 --> 2462.8799999999997
roughly figure out 2/3 of what they're

2462.0 --> 2465.96
talking

2462.88 --> 2469.079
about just by

2465.96 --> 2471.04
listening Cally they leave Shan out no

2469.079 --> 2474.4
they

2471.04 --> 2479.52
don't that's

2474.4 --> 2479.52
laziness yeah that's called poor German

2494.56 --> 2499.52
what Jesus Christ could you just stop

2497.68 --> 2502.0789999999997
spamming all this [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are

2499.52 --> 2502.079
you talking

2514.04 --> 2519.24
about that is colloquial talk lazy yeah

2517.119 --> 2523.04
well well don't speak lazy German in my

2519.24 --> 2523.04
presence or English

2549.28 --> 2554.7200000000003
I mean is that's not what Germans say

2552.559 --> 2554.7200000000003
they

2557.24 --> 2562.16
says yeah that's how they say

2568.88 --> 2575.119
it

2571.16 --> 2579.1189999999997
no no they don't say

2575.119 --> 2579.119
that they ask what

2580.319 --> 2586.839
do you speak

2582.52 --> 2586.839
German speak you

2590.319 --> 2597.7599999999998
German

2593.0 --> 2600.88
yeah they don't say can

2597.76 --> 2604.76
you good

2600.88 --> 2608.1600000000003
German or they don't say

2604.76 --> 2611.119
that you speak German well sounds like

2608.16 --> 2611.1189999999997
you kind of suck at

2612.04 --> 2618.48
it like I don't speak German and I'm

2615.2 --> 2622.9199999999996
better able to figure this out I heard a

2618.48 --> 2622.92
lot of German people German people

2634.72 --> 2639.04
speak that's exactly what this is

2640.24 --> 2644.16
no no you just

2655.8 --> 2661.079
suck or you typically hang around people

2658.839 --> 2664.2
that kind of suck and just don't speak

2661.079 --> 2666.319
German properly I mean that could be it

2664.2 --> 2668.96
if you hang around people that just talk

2666.319 --> 2672.16
shitty you're going to learn to talk

2668.96 --> 2674.44
shitty so I'm going to assume that

2672.16 --> 2676.319
that's the the cause that's the root

2674.44 --> 2678.68
cause of why you think that that's

2676.319 --> 2678.68
proper

2684.72 --> 2692.2799999999997
German 100% correct all of the time and

2687.839 --> 2692.2799999999997
everything no you're not shut the [ __ ]

2693.64 --> 2698.359
up my good friend

2738.52 --> 2740.839
I'm

2744.44 --> 2749.599
GNA yeah but that's an Americanization

2773.44 --> 2778.4
yeah I

2774.559 --> 2782.3590000000004
mean German mostly one continent and

2778.4 --> 2785.04
some other like one country some other

2782.359 --> 2788.16
countries that have German adjacent

2785.04 --> 2790.72
Swiss and austri and all

2788.16 --> 2796.8799999999997
that yeah

2790.72 --> 2799.64
English has like completely different

2796.88 --> 2802.2400000000002
factions that are completely different

2799.64 --> 2806.92
America is like a dramatic

2802.24 --> 2809.8799999999997
change in many ways compared to original

2806.92 --> 2817.079
English and even like Scottish and Irish

2809.88 --> 2817.079
are like Sid trcks of it a lot

2825.64 --> 2829.2799999999997
look I don't want to talk German with

2827.559 --> 2832.8
you what the [ __ ] are you doing here

2829.28 --> 2832.8
culture cats

2856.52 --> 2862.04
why is your stream what languages today

2858.52 --> 2862.04
because you brought it up

2864.599 --> 2871.8
[ __ ] it's not about

2867.079 --> 2871.8
languages you brought it up

2887.559 --> 2890.8390000000004
much rather talk

2891.24 --> 2897.5589999999997
about the life charging

2894.52 --> 2899.96
power of water being influenced by

2897.559 --> 2902.96
sematic structures and the other way

2899.96 --> 2902.96
around

2911.839 --> 2916.92
uh what I can do culture cats is time

2914.64 --> 2916.92
you

2916.96 --> 2920.48
out how about

2921.44 --> 2927.359
that I'm not here to talk German with

2924.359 --> 2927.359
you

2960.76 --> 2965.559
could somebody please tell me what these

2962.96 --> 2967.68
two are talking

2965.559 --> 2971.0400000000004
about okay

2967.68 --> 2974.7599999999998
okay take 30 minute time

2971.04 --> 2974.7599999999998
out I'm done with

2990.88 --> 2998.6400000000003
you yeah go hang over at fed and go

2994.52 --> 2998.64
bother them with your stupid German

3002.76 --> 3007.3190000000004
you like that yeah oh well it's not

3005.319 --> 3009.88
really friends right I mean did I

3007.319 --> 3013.92
declare friendship did I confirm

3009.88 --> 3013.92
friendship no no I

3015.799 --> 3021.92
didn't he's an acquaintance and I sort

3019.559 --> 3025.3590000000004
of tolerate him in my chat until he

3021.92 --> 3027.64
becomes a nuisance like today again and

3025.359 --> 3030.119
that keeps happening every damn time he

3027.64 --> 3032.48
shows up just goes off on some

3030.119 --> 3034.88
nonsensical tangent that's not

3032.48 --> 3038.2
interesting and wasting everybody's time

3034.88 --> 3041.599
and dragging everybody along in his

3038.2 --> 3044.5589999999997
nonsense I I'm not going to have it you

3041.599 --> 3047.3590000000004
got it you want to talk about German

3044.559 --> 3051.799
culture cats do your own damn stream

3047.359 --> 3051.799
then you go talk about German

3052.52 --> 3058.64
there yeah I don't give a [ __ ] what he

3055.2 --> 3058.64
says Gary f

3066.48 --> 3072.44
yeah he's gone

3068.68 --> 3072.44
Stephen I timed him

3079.44 --> 3084.319
[Music]

3081.64 --> 3086.64
out go hang around in Discord or

3084.319 --> 3088.839
something if you like him so much not in

3086.64 --> 3088.839
my

3091.48 --> 3101.559
chat is German good

3095.599 --> 3101.559
no he speaks shitty lazy colloquial

3102.079 --> 3108.3590000000004
German like German of the retards people

3105.76 --> 3111.92
that don't actually make effort to say

3108.359 --> 3115.96
it right yeah it

3111.92 --> 3120.7200000000003
sucks yeah it was bad it sucks it's lazy

3115.96 --> 3123.52
German it sucks yeah German is a high

3120.72 --> 3127.16
language is an highly intelligent

3123.52 --> 3129.68
language if you get sloppy with it you

3127.16 --> 3129.68
become

3140.44 --> 3144.44
dumb right

3151.48 --> 3156.799
don't come here with your sock accounts

3153.28 --> 3159.079
I will kick all of you out yeah I give

3156.799 --> 3160.119
you a time out that means you stay away

3159.079 --> 3162.079
if you're going to come in with your

3160.119 --> 3164.599
sock accounts I'm going to ban all your

3162.079 --> 3167.119
accounts and then you won't come back

3164.599 --> 3167.119
you

3171.799 --> 3178.44
understand you got it you're not welcome

3174.359 --> 3178.44
here this is not your chat

3182.839 --> 3188.92
I don't care

3184.68 --> 3188.9199999999996
AI I don't want to talk about

3189.04 --> 3196.079
this yeah Outsiders are not going to

3192.52 --> 3196.079
determine what my show is

3198.76 --> 3203.7990000000004
about unless I agree

3229.72 --> 3232.72
okay

3241.319 --> 3247.4
kind of yeah let just stop this [ __ ]

3260.83 --> 3263.989
[Music]

3265.359 --> 3269.359
guys for

3320.119 --> 3323.52
this is interesting

3349.16 --> 3353.64
some interesting simatic pictures

3360.079 --> 3367.2400000000002
see I can share

3362.96 --> 3367.2400000000002
that bendy water

3375.0 --> 3380.079
no sematic structures

3384.839 --> 3391.64
this I'm at very

3388.2 --> 3391.64
important key of

3392.68 --> 3397.7599999999998
resonance and there proof that there is

3395.88 --> 3400.6400000000003
structure in

3397.76 --> 3401.96
resonance and we can apply that for

3400.64 --> 3405.16
healing

3401.96 --> 3407.839
purposes for energizing purposes which

3405.16 --> 3409.359
in pretty much from this perspective is

3407.839 --> 3413.68
the same

3409.359 --> 3416.7599999999998
thing right and ancient buildings the

3413.68 --> 3419.48
buildings from Teraria arguably

3416.76 --> 3422.3590000000004
that has been hidden from us were built

3419.48 --> 3426.2
by people that had a full understanding

3422.359 --> 3427.96
about this and they designed their

3426.2 --> 3431.319
buildings and the layouts of those

3427.96 --> 3435.92
buildings specifically to harness

3431.319 --> 3439.96
simatic power to the maximum of their

3435.92 --> 3442.64
ability which had great

3439.96 --> 3444.68
influence on the surrounding life on the

3442.64 --> 3447.4
water water would become structured like

3444.68 --> 3450.2
it is like the heart structurized water

3447.4 --> 3453.839
in her in her blood there's this whole

3450.2 --> 3453.839
thing remember that video from Greg

3454.559 --> 3464.1600000000003
Reese and yeah the ancient architecture

3458.24 --> 3464.16
used that knowledge looks like the stars

3468.16 --> 3473.68
what

3469.68 --> 3473.68
uh no

3484.599 --> 3489.4
right but you want to see more of those

3486.2 --> 3491.52
patterns just type in simatics exactly

3489.4 --> 3494.559
like how I spelled it in the

3491.52 --> 3498.7599999999998
title we even find this pattern Flower

3494.559 --> 3498.76
of Life is also simatic in

3502.52 --> 3506.88
origin all right take care of the chat

3504.68 --> 3509.48
prro I'm going to put my Illuminati go

3506.88 --> 3512.039
sun in the oven turn on the coffee and

3509.48 --> 3512.039
be right

3535.039 --> 3538.039
back

3565.039 --> 3569.079
for e

3612.72 --> 3617.3999999999996
all different patterns correlating to

3615.4 --> 3618.559
each different frequency yes this is

3617.4 --> 3620.1600000000003
also

3618.559 --> 3626.88
expressed

3620.16 --> 3630.5989999999997
in Dr emoto's water freezing test

3626.88 --> 3630.599
it's all connected all of

3633.039 --> 3637.599
it it's Wonder to think about this yes

3636.28 --> 3640.079
it

3637.599 --> 3643.48
is it's even more wondrous when you

3640.079 --> 3645.7200000000003
realize like that like entire city

3643.48 --> 3649.28
layouts and star

3645.72 --> 3651.52
fortresses and separated buildings were

3649.28 --> 3657.039
specifically

3651.52 --> 3660.7599999999998
designed for simatic purposes

3657.039 --> 3664.5200000000004
to spread certain sound like churches

3660.76 --> 3667.119
were like sound

3664.52 --> 3670.88
redistributors that special windows that

3667.119 --> 3670.88
literally are like sound

3671.319 --> 3676.119
amplifiers and the bells also had

3674.16 --> 3679.1189999999997
something to do with that it's all very

3676.119 --> 3679.119
fascinating

3690.0 --> 3697.68
are you asking me AI CZ no no I

3694.119 --> 3701.6800000000003
haven't don't have a

3697.68 --> 3703.48
p1000 and yeah I've never really taken

3701.68 --> 3706.8799999999997
the effort to try to capture it on the

3703.48 --> 3706.88
p900 as well

3707.52 --> 3713.2
so sure there's plenty of videos out

3710.2 --> 3713.2
there

3737.279 --> 3741.039
what do you mean no f

3744.839 --> 3748.88
routs for

3804.96 --> 3814.4
Sonic G that apparently they call

3809.0 --> 3814.4
simatics Sonic geometry which is

3820.52 --> 3825.48
fine right but it's kind of interesting

3823.359 --> 3829.24
How Sound and

3825.48 --> 3833.119
magnetism through simatics and resonance

3829.24 --> 3836.5989999999997
seem to also have connections there it's

3833.119 --> 3839.4
always suggest like oh it's light

3836.599 --> 3843.0
light and magnetism and that's why ether

3839.4 --> 3844.76
ether yeah yeah no no ether like ether

3843.0 --> 3847.92
has nothing to do with

3844.76 --> 3851.0
this I you could call it ether but it's

3847.92 --> 3854.76
[ __ ] like it's just

3851.0 --> 3856.559
energy and is a mechanical structure of

3854.76 --> 3861.0
things

3856.559 --> 3862.4
to Direct Energy yeah simatics can be

3861.0 --> 3866.119
used to

3862.4 --> 3870.48
Direct Energy

3866.119 --> 3873.279
and charge water or people or amplify

3870.48 --> 3875.64
sound it's nothing to do with ether you

3873.279 --> 3879.68
could call it ether and everybody seems

3875.64 --> 3881.96
to love to do that but it has nothing to

3879.68 --> 3885.24
do with ether you could just like that

3881.96 --> 3889.119
would be a catch all phrase to

3885.24 --> 3892.799
name a like an a field of influence a

3889.119 --> 3895.119
thing a set of things that are like

3892.799 --> 3896.44
engineering based like really high

3895.119 --> 3899.48
complicated

3896.44 --> 3899.48
arguably ancient

3899.96 --> 3905.039
engineering do I think the stars are the

3902.359 --> 3908.44
same height they don't have any height

3905.039 --> 3911.88
Steven Jaris there is no height there is

3908.44 --> 3916.96
no distance there's no actual

3911.88 --> 3916.96
location hello C how are you doing

3939.24 --> 3946.0789999999997
okay well AI if you were talking to

3941.72 --> 3950.3999999999996
fibroids then maybe next time add the

3946.079 --> 3952.44
name directly next to the question not

3950.4 --> 3955.52
in the next

3952.44 --> 3958.92
sentence you have a asked question that

3955.52 --> 3963.359
is is specifically for somebody in the

3958.92 --> 3966.6800000000003
chat then make sure to add the name of

3963.359 --> 3969.24
the one you're asking the question to in

3966.68 --> 3972.24
the same

3969.24 --> 3972.24
sentence

3973.24 --> 3978.52
yeah instead of like adding three more

3976.559 --> 3984.48
sentences to try to explain the

3978.52 --> 3984.48
communication error there how about that

3991.83 --> 3995.98
[Music]

3997.279 --> 4002.359
like you did

3999.4 --> 4005.0
yeah right but I mean if you don't add

4002.359 --> 4007.96
my name to the question I'm still going

4005.0 --> 4011.279
to assume you're talking to me guess why

4007.96 --> 4011.279
because it's my

4011.48 --> 4019.119
show and my show runs on interacting

4015.4 --> 4022.0
with with my chat so yeah adding my name

4019.119 --> 4024.7200000000003
to your question will bring it to my

4022.0 --> 4027.2
attention even quicker but even if you

4024.72 --> 4030.5589999999997
didn't add my name I'm still going to

4027.2 --> 4032.64
assume that you asked me right that's

4030.559 --> 4034.4
the default if you're asking a question

4032.64 --> 4037.8799999999997
in the chat I'm going to assume you

4034.4 --> 4041.7200000000003
asked me I'm going to respond to

4037.88 --> 4047.1600000000003
it you have a question for somebody

4041.72 --> 4050.8799999999997
else add their name within that

4047.16 --> 4054.24
sentence agitated no I'm

4050.88 --> 4056.4
just done with the sloppiness and cats

4054.24 --> 4058.359
came in in here trying to change the

4056.4 --> 4061.319
subject and everything and it's like

4058.359 --> 4063.92
everybody seems to be treating this like

4061.319 --> 4065.839
this is just some Pub or something which

4063.92 --> 4068.799
it

4065.839 --> 4073.4
isn't trying to have a serious

4068.799 --> 4073.4
conversation about a serious subject

4076.0 --> 4080.72
R streaming me what what does that

4103.319 --> 4108.679
mean what's the [ __ ] is the point of

4105.679 --> 4108.679
that

4147.679 --> 4155.64
it's my show but different what what is

4150.839 --> 4155.64
it a direct copy of my current live

4156.239 --> 4162.159
show or is it just some stupid other

4159.04 --> 4165.799
stream that he's just doing whatever

4162.159 --> 4165.799
with Moxy

4174.04 --> 4179.199
yeah please be

4185.64 --> 4191.96
specific no I can't do Super Chat Steven

4189.48 --> 4195.919999999999
Jarvis my Channel's

4191.96 --> 4195.92
demonetized can't try to

4197.8 --> 4205.6
what you can always this show oh okay

4203.0 --> 4205.6
yeah that's not

4208.199 --> 4212.96
allowed I don't care if he changes it a

4210.719 --> 4216.32
bit it's my live show he's not allowed

4212.96 --> 4216.32
to stream my live

4224.32 --> 4227.32
show

4254.239 --> 4257.239
for

4284.239 --> 4288.28
for for

4307.23 --> 4310.429999999999
[Applause]

4323.159 --> 4326.159
that

4345.72 --> 4348.89
[Applause]

4361.159 --> 4364.159
that's

4369.26 --> 4372.35
[Music]

4400.6 --> 4406.159000000001
what what is this [ __ ]

4443.719 --> 4447.56
okay there right now

4465.6 --> 4472.719
problems yeah somebody's copying my live

4468.32 --> 4475.759999999999
stream live and that's not

4472.719 --> 4479.4800000000005
acceptable you want to do some [ __ ]

4475.76 --> 4483.04
[ __ ] video response to it or review

4479.48 --> 4483.04
that's fine don't copy my

4485.639 --> 4492.08
streams like especially when they're

4487.88 --> 4492.08
live that is not acceptable

4519.04 --> 4525.88
but no no have no problem here

4521.04 --> 4525.88
whatsoever it's all fine it's all good

4527.56 --> 4532.6
yeah and hey if you have something to

4529.96 --> 4535.6
add about the title subject love to hear

4532.6 --> 4537.1990000000005
about it maybe you're an outsider maybe

4535.6 --> 4540.400000000001
you're like a flat

4537.199 --> 4542.96
earther and you're into ether and like

4540.4 --> 4545.5199999999995
that's fine you're into ether it's okay

4542.96 --> 4548.6
you can talk about ether

4545.52 --> 4549.56
here just realize that it is kind of a

4548.6 --> 4553.52
cluster

4549.56 --> 4558.88
screw and it is a colloquial

4553.52 --> 4558.88
designation of a group of

4559.32 --> 4565.88
effects

4561.04 --> 4568.159
that are not scientific in any way but I

4565.88 --> 4569.96
definitely recognize that there is a

4568.159 --> 4572.04
bunch of

4569.96 --> 4576.199
engineered

4572.04 --> 4577.76
knowledge that could be considered ether

4576.199 --> 4580.239
you could call it

4577.76 --> 4582.719
that you could call that

4580.239 --> 4585.04
influence that you can use and you can

4582.719 --> 4587.56
build around it you can call that ether

4585.04 --> 4590.76
it isn't really ether so I don't really

4587.56 --> 4593.120000000001
call it ether I'd rather just call it

4590.76 --> 4595.04
lifechanging power of water influencing

4593.12 --> 4598.4
simatic

4595.04 --> 4601.88
structures right because that's way more

4598.4 --> 4606.159
specific to a big thing that has an

4601.88 --> 4606.159000000001
influence like it's

4606.32 --> 4612.28
structures cause energies that are in

4609.159 --> 4614.96
the air and a side effect even of life

4612.28 --> 4617.239
life has energy Fields yeah those energy

4614.96 --> 4620.8
Fields can be influenced by structures

4617.239 --> 4624.04
especially if they're simatic based

4620.8 --> 4627.719
architecture now you can call that

4624.04 --> 4631.0
ether but that's just really confusing

4627.719 --> 4633.4800000000005
especially considering ether is claimed

4631.0 --> 4637.239
to be an

4633.48 --> 4640.04
effect that is has to do with the speed

4637.239 --> 4643.959999999999
of light and all these misassumptions

4640.04 --> 4645.8
from within physics yeah so I prefer to

4643.96 --> 4647.32
not call it either but I understand if

4645.8 --> 4650.76
you

4647.32 --> 4655.08
would and we can talk about

4650.76 --> 4658.96
it did Tesla think it was real yeah but

4655.08 --> 4661.12
he did not claim science to it though he

4658.96 --> 4663.6
really he just saw it as like oh this is

4661.12 --> 4666.32
an engineering

4663.6 --> 4669.719
development that's how Tesla saw it

4666.32 --> 4669.719
because he was

4669.76 --> 4676.52
honest he wasn't like a pseudo science

4673.88 --> 4679.4400000000005
clown that's just like oh I want to be

4676.52 --> 4682.0
popular I'm going to adapt to the

4679.44 --> 4685.12
consensus priesthood he wasn't like that

4682.0 --> 4686.84
at all but he was interested by the

4685.12 --> 4689.599999999999
concept of

4686.84 --> 4691.159000000001
ether but he very much realized that it

4689.6 --> 4696.320000000001
was within

4691.159 --> 4696.32
engineering that such ideas come

4696.92 --> 4702.0
forth as far as I'm aware of

4721.639 --> 4726.0
right yeah and Moxy that's cool thanks

4724.56 --> 4729.04
for helping

4726.0 --> 4732.159
me think it's fair use no it's not fair

4729.04 --> 4736.32
use it's not fair use

4732.159 --> 4738.799999999999
to stream what I'm talking about live

4736.32 --> 4741.239
that's not fair use at all it's called

4738.8 --> 4744.84
parasiting that's called parasiting on

4741.239 --> 4748.759999999999
my show it's not fair use at all I do

4744.84 --> 4750.56
not give permission for people to simoc

4748.76 --> 4753.2390000000005
cast My

4750.56 --> 4757.84

4753.239 --> 4760.839999999999
really shitty bullying slideshows over

4757.84 --> 4763.400000000001
it yeah this is my

4760.84 --> 4764.92
stream you want to have something to do

4763.4 --> 4766.199
with that or you're going to going to

4764.92 --> 4770.0
have to do it

4766.199 --> 4772.32
afterward not while I'm live or you're

4770.0 --> 4774.6
going to have to adapt to my

4772.32 --> 4778.799999999999
chat yeah

4774.6 --> 4781.679
properly and then talk to me live in my

4778.8 --> 4785.76
chat yeah no

4781.679 --> 4788.4800000000005

you have no [ __ ] life you have even

4821.52 --> 4828.040000000001
less life than

4823.159 --> 4833.08
me yeah My Life as a urban

4828.04 --> 4836.56
hermit is more stable than yours those

4833.08 --> 4840.88
trolls yeah you want to do that then

4836.56 --> 4843.4800000000005
just put my live stream on in Discord or

4840.88 --> 4845.52
something then you can just

4843.48 --> 4848.799999999999
chat in

4845.52 --> 4852.2390000000005
Discord alongside it

4848.8 --> 4855.2390000000005
yeah you don't Sim will stream it on

4852.239 --> 4855.239

4983.52 --> 4989.1990000000005
Pub and just leave like waste my my

who the hell you're talking about Sam I

4998.88 --> 5003.88
don't give a [ __ ] that somebody that I

5001.6 --> 5006.360000000001
don't know who that is doesn't care

5003.88 --> 5009.96
about some else raming their streams

5006.36 --> 5009.96
yeah stop blabbering

5015.01 --> 5018.159000000001
[Music]

5018.76 --> 5026.4800000000005
nonsense stick to the

5022.04 --> 5026.48
subject because today's show has a

5028.239 --> 5032.599999999999
subject there's nothing you can do about

5030.48 --> 5036.44
it well there's something I can do about

5032.6 --> 5036.4400000000005
it and I have

5052.84 --> 5059.159000000001
right and I'm going to get my Illuminati

5054.4 --> 5059.159
C on and coffee and I'll be right

5063.32 --> 5066.32
back

5093.32 --> 5097.36
e for

5128.42 --> 5131.499
[Music]

5134.08 --> 5136.719
YouTube

5141.199 --> 5148.719
no no it's not very

5144.28 --> 5148.719
use G itch

5157.32 --> 5161.44
you want to review me then you're going

5158.8 --> 5165.320000000001
to have to pause me you're going to have

5161.44 --> 5168.96
to talk through it add something else to

5165.32 --> 5172.599999999999
it if you're just going to make a direct

5168.96 --> 5174.36
live raw copy of my sound and do your

5172.6 --> 5176.04
own live stream with it no that's a

5174.36 --> 5178.119
copyright

5176.04 --> 5179.92
infringement do not give anybody

5178.119 --> 5185.44
permission to do

5179.92 --> 5188.679
that right unless they are on with me on

5185.44 --> 5191.919999999999
the live stream

5188.679 --> 5194.04
live together and they're also

5191.92 --> 5196.32
broadcasting it on their Channel yeah

5194.04 --> 5196.32
that's

5201.56 --> 5208.2390000000005
different you're not just going to copy

5204.36 --> 5210.159
my live stream like while it's happening

5208.239 --> 5214.159
and you have nothing to do with

5210.159 --> 5214.159
it no

5222.28 --> 5225.159
it's not a straight

5227.92 --> 5232.8
copy just because the visuals are not

5230.6 --> 5234.56
there does it mean that is not a direct

5232.8 --> 5239.4800000000005
copy of the

5234.56 --> 5239.4800000000005
sound exactly as is

5241.32 --> 5246.199
so

5242.96 --> 5251.0
but how how about we [ __ ] drop the

5246.199 --> 5254.04
subject now yeah don't come in here

5251.0 --> 5256.32
subtly out of nowhere to blabber on

5254.04 --> 5256.32
about

5262.48 --> 5269.678999999999
it stick to the subject come here talk

5266.36 --> 5273.28
about the subject subject is the life

5269.679 --> 5276.119
charging power of water influencing

5273.28 --> 5276.119
simatic structure

5277.4 --> 5283.799999999999
simatics Life Energy resonance that's

5281.119 --> 5286.4
the subject for today things that are

5283.8 --> 5289.56
associated with a concept of ether even

5286.4 --> 5292.199
though that concept is not

5289.56 --> 5296.400000000001
scientific it's not cohesive and it

5292.199 --> 5296.4
definitely does not reveal the nature of

5297.679 --> 5303.719
light no I don't want to [ __ ] link to

5300.52 --> 5303.719
it clearly

5313.08 --> 5317.119
yeah that's right culture catch you were

5314.6 --> 5320.88
timed out for half an

5317.119 --> 5320.88
hour okay

5322.92 --> 5327.119
yeah all right so anybody else want to

5325.84 --> 5331.6
be a smart

5327.119 --> 5334.599999999999
mouth time you out you go go over there

5331.6 --> 5334.6
then

5343.08 --> 5346.18
[Music]

5358.48 --> 5362.638999999999
yeah so they're doing something like

5361.08 --> 5366.04
that and there's nothing I can do about

5362.639 --> 5366.04
it then don't bring it up

5370.96 --> 5376.0
no culture cats I timed you out because

5373.32 --> 5379.759999999999
you kept on talking about a subject

5376.0 --> 5381.76
that's not on the menu today that's why

5379.76 --> 5384.08
and you were spamming my chat with that

5381.76 --> 5386.280000000001
[ __ ] you were drawing other people in

5384.08 --> 5387.679
with that [ __ ] and I'm not having it and

5386.28 --> 5389.719
if you're going to do it again I will

5387.679 --> 5393.639
ban

5389.719 --> 5396.719
you and if anybody else starts talking

5393.639 --> 5401.04
with tats about his distracting subject

5396.719 --> 5401.04
that's not on the menu I will ban you

5416.239 --> 5420.638999999999
too you got it

5424.199 --> 5430.04
I'm talking about well why don't you

5426.8 --> 5432.88
read the title with your eyes culture

5430.04 --> 5434.679
cats I've been talking about it since

5432.88 --> 5437.76
the start of the

5434.679 --> 5440.639
show do you even listen to the [ __ ]

5437.76 --> 5443.1990000000005
stream you're in the chat of do you even

5440.639 --> 5443.1990000000005
listen to

5448.719 --> 5453.56
anything don't talk like that

5455.119 --> 5461.96
now if you're going to give me lip like

5457.44 --> 5461.96
that one more time you're out

5471.52 --> 5474.579000000001
[Music]

5501.8 --> 5508.679
mean not you him who the [ __ ] are you

5505.28 --> 5514.32
talking about Moxy remember about

5508.679 --> 5514.32
putting the names in the sentences

5518.04 --> 5523.76
yeah just instructed you about that not

5520.92 --> 5523.76
even 10 minutes

5529.48 --> 5534.32

cheers for

5629.18 --> 5632.259
[Music]

5655.199 --> 5658.199
h

5666.44 --> 5669.199
a the weather is

5679.8 --> 5683.679
brilliant all right anyway hope

5681.92 --> 5687.96
everybody's enjoying the show and maybe

5683.679 --> 5690.52
you're think it's like oh arwi so

5687.96 --> 5695.639
rough it's because there's people in the

5690.52 --> 5695.639
chat that are just being very annoying

5696.92 --> 5703.2390000000005
I'm treating this like this is like some

5698.639 --> 5703.2390000000005
hang around Pub it isn't

5735.84 --> 5744.119000000001
but you will have to

5737.719 --> 5746.36
endar me eating on camera and on the mic

5744.119 --> 5748.5599999999995
and drinking

5746.36 --> 5752.08
coffee that's one thing you're going to

5748.56 --> 5757.0
have to endure though pretty much every

5752.08 --> 5757.0
show it's part of it it's what I

5758.56 --> 5766.080000000001
do and if you have a problem with it

5761.36 --> 5766.08
then don't watch my show

5788.239 --> 5791.239
h

5811.17 --> 5814.319
[Music]

5820.159 --> 5825.599999999999
so has any of you ever

5822.48 --> 5828.599999999999
been to a

5825.6 --> 5828.6
simatic

5831.28 --> 5837.88
architecture to a star for perhaps

5834.76 --> 5840.320000000001
anybody here if you ever been to a place

5837.88 --> 5846.4800000000005
that is like a star

5840.32 --> 5846.48
for surrounded by water anybody for

5884.88 --> 5888.56
felt like a machine what do you

5888.679 --> 5893.0
mean fibs thanks for telling

5898.0 --> 5905.44
me cuz I have been at one of those

5901.52 --> 5905.4400000000005
places it's when I was younger though

5908.599 --> 5913.84
but I distinctly remember that

5911.44 --> 5916.159
there's in these types of places there's

5913.84 --> 5918.08
energy in the air it's

5916.159 --> 5921.5199999999995
ripe and when I was younger

5918.08 --> 5921.5199999999995
unfortunately I was not

5922.159 --> 5927.799999999999
really good with that I I would get

5929.4 --> 5933.879999999999
overcharged it would make me

5931.48 --> 5936.04
significantly more hyperactive active

5933.88 --> 5940.159000000001
acting

5936.04 --> 5943.76
and like become more over sensitive to

5940.159 --> 5945.44
say things like criticism and basically

5943.76 --> 5949.599
it would make me snap

5945.44 --> 5949.598999999999
more that's what I remember from

5953.159 --> 5959.96
it and I mean logically yeah it inserts

5957.08 --> 5964.08
energy in the air because of the simatic

5959.96 --> 5967.0
structure the energy will then

5964.08 --> 5970.8
amplify circulate

5967.0 --> 5973.0
amplify structurize water which is part

5970.8 --> 5973.0
of

5973.04 --> 5977.44
it and then influence you by

5977.52 --> 5985.320000000001
resonance but if there's anything broken

5980.96 --> 5987.56
about you or if there's like elements of

5985.32 --> 5990.239
you that are

5987.56 --> 5991.159000000001
suppressed by yourself because you can't

5990.239 --> 5994.839999999999
face

5991.159 --> 5997.879999999999
it you're going to have issues

5994.84 --> 5997.88
around these types of

6004.36 --> 6009.92
structures the planetarium yeah I don't

6007.52 --> 6012.92
think the planetarium is a simatic

6009.92 --> 6015.119
structure stepen

6012.92 --> 6016.679
Jarvis don't know what the hell that has

6015.119 --> 6019.679
to do with anything that I'm talking

6016.679 --> 6019.679
about

6042.32 --> 6048.5599999999995
so anybody else besides fiber o you ever

6049.159 --> 6056.159
visited a star Fortress anybody

6053.88 --> 6058.8
is fiber outs the only [ __ ] person

6056.159 --> 6062.799999999999
here in the chat that has ever done

6058.8 --> 6065.599
that are you all just Perpetual ballards

6062.8 --> 6068.56
you only go to stupid dinosaur museums

6065.599 --> 6071.679
and planetariums is that all you ever do

6068.56 --> 6071.679
you ever leave your

6079.199 --> 6085.239
house have the effects of the eclipse

6082.08 --> 6085.239
passed yeah

6086.679 --> 6089.92
yeah they have passed that's

6108.719 --> 6115.679
right I mean effects of an eclipse never

6112.679 --> 6115.679
last over two

6124.4 --> 6129.4
weeks the acute effects that is I

6132.76 --> 6139.639
mean the astrological significant

6135.639 --> 6139.639
influences like the age of Aquarius

6139.8 --> 6145.159000000001
starting yeah that's that's not going to

6145.719 --> 6150.199
but the acute

6147.719 --> 6152.2390000000005
influences of the celestial event on

6150.199 --> 6154.678999999999
people's moods all that yeah that's

6152.239 --> 6157.4
that's gone just like a full

6154.679 --> 6159.76
moon when it's full has an influence

6157.4 --> 6161.598999999999
then it goes away

6159.76 --> 6163.679
again

6161.599 --> 6166.400000000001
for almost a

6163.679 --> 6171.36
month before it comes back with the new

6166.4 --> 6171.36
Full Moon building up to it

6192.679 --> 6196.119
yeah fibos it is super

6196.44 --> 6201.839999999999
interesting and it is tragic that

6199.84 --> 6205.719
this

6201.84 --> 6209.119000000001
cheap you utilization of technology

6205.719 --> 6211.719
and architecture engineering is being

6209.119 --> 6215.04
completely ignored and suppressed it's

6211.719 --> 6215.04
very sad

6235.159 --> 6239.96
yeah so what stepen Jarvis who

6258.239 --> 6263.5199999999995
cares hey dupons good to see you

6291.84 --> 6295.04
M taste that good

6295.599 --> 6300.0
oh that's an airplane I thought it was a

6300.239 --> 6304.799999999999
storm looks like the wind is picking up

6302.599 --> 6307.360000000001
a bit but that's kind of

6304.8 --> 6310.08
nice those places had their own

6307.36 --> 6310.08
sustained

6312.36 --> 6316.88
sound

6314.159 --> 6320.759999999999
uh well doesn't

6316.88 --> 6324.599
maybe not necessarily I mean simatic

6320.76 --> 6327.360000000001
resonance influences are not necessar

6324.599 --> 6331.400000000001
audible sound it's just like

6327.36 --> 6331.4
how sound bounces

6343.199 --> 6348.759999999999
around doesn't mean you're continually

6345.84 --> 6348.76
hearing certain

6349.52 --> 6354.639
sound Gary could you just [ __ ] leave

6353.08 --> 6358.96
it alone

6354.639 --> 6358.96
already just shut the [ __ ]

6366.52 --> 6372.52
up hey LSG good to see you

6383.77 --> 6386.859
[Music]

6408.239 --> 6412.32
the building itself would resonate if a

6409.92 --> 6414.04
bell of certain tone was Dr yes that

6412.32 --> 6417.239
does happen

6414.04 --> 6419.04
definitely I mean the simatic structures

6417.239 --> 6421.36
the simatic

6419.04 --> 6424.96
architecture becomes really apparent

6421.36 --> 6427.28
when certain types of sounds resonate

6424.96 --> 6430.679
which is especially Bells then like

6427.28 --> 6433.119
everything resonates with its

6430.679 --> 6438.119
specifically things that were meant to

6433.119 --> 6440.4
resonate with it because of the simatic

6438.119 --> 6443.639
architecture I should probably call it

6440.4 --> 6445.92
simatic architecture

6443.639 --> 6445.92
is

6468.599 --> 6476.76
better yes water and sound lifechanging

6473.8 --> 6479.599
power water and sound influencing

6476.76 --> 6482.599
simatics simatic

6479.599 --> 6482.599
architecture

6498.32 --> 6502.44
yes in Minneapolis

6513.04 --> 6519.76
Catholic Church well F roads I mean a

6516.44 --> 6522.719
lot of these places are

6519.76 --> 6524.360000000001
claimed by a Catholic church or any kind

6522.719 --> 6529.599
of church but I

6524.36 --> 6533.88
mean did they actually build that you

6529.599 --> 6533.88
know did they

6537.52 --> 6542.0
I have a lot of doubts about that I

6539.719 --> 6544.199
think that a lot of really Supreme

6542.0 --> 6547.199
architecture was

6544.199 --> 6549.96
not

6547.199 --> 6553.598999999999
constructed by these churches and all

6549.96 --> 6553.599
that like with all their power and

6557.92 --> 6563.119
everything right and then later when

6560.639 --> 6565.2390000000005
they claim a building like that that had

6563.119 --> 6568.759999999999
an other

6565.239 --> 6570.28
purpose then they can like fill it in

6568.76 --> 6572.92
with their corruption and that's what

6570.28 --> 6575.5599999999995
you're going to pick up on

6572.92 --> 6577.4400000000005
then they feel like machines yeah that's

6575.56 --> 6578.400000000001
probably because they were they were

6577.44 --> 6581.719
just

6578.4 --> 6585.598999999999
devices electromagnetic devices and they

6581.719 --> 6587.36
weren't even necessarily meant as a

6585.599 --> 6590.28
place of

6587.36 --> 6593.36
gathering perhaps the place a

6590.28 --> 6596.119
healing and then religion

6593.36 --> 6599.159
rolled in and started to blabber on

6596.119 --> 6602.239
about how you're really supposed to

6599.159 --> 6605.44
heal through prayer and blah blah blah

6602.239 --> 6608.32
and all these things making people

6605.44 --> 6610.119
forget about the actual technology

6608.32 --> 6611.679
that's just technology and doesn't have

6610.119 --> 6613.679
anything to do with reasoning or

6611.679 --> 6617.2390000000005
thinking or

6613.679 --> 6617.2390000000005
anything it's just a

6617.599 --> 6624.400000000001
technology yeah then you indoctrinate

6621.4 --> 6628.839999999999
people with religious dogma and then

6624.4 --> 6628.839999999999
eventually they forget about the

6630.52 --> 6635.080000000001
technology and then the technology can

6632.96 --> 6637.84
be broken down and removed and nobody

6635.08 --> 6640.599
will object because nobody will remember

6637.84 --> 6640.599
that it is even

6640.719 --> 6648.199
there and that's the story of how they

6643.84 --> 6648.1990000000005
erased and removed tartaria

6651.62 --> 6654.68
[Music]

6677.0 --> 6681.079
can't comment on the title it's above

6678.639 --> 6683.2390000000005
your head I don't know why though I mean

6681.079 --> 6686.239
it's not that complicated I'm talking

6683.239 --> 6689.919999999999
about it I'm talking about it right

6686.239 --> 6691.28
now I mean is it maybe Steven jar it

6689.92 --> 6694.639
just sounds

6691.28 --> 6696.679
like to you and you just don't hear a

6694.639 --> 6700.32
thing I'm saying but I'm talking about

6696.679 --> 6702.92
it the entire stream I'm talking about

6700.32 --> 6707.799999999999
it I don't understand how it's above

6702.92 --> 6711.28
your head when it's right there and I've

6707.8 --> 6713.2390000000005
explained everything about the title

6711.28 --> 6715.48
I've explained how how is that above

6713.239 --> 6715.48
your

6720.84 --> 6726.4800000000005
head or are you just having a really

6723.4 --> 6732.0
tired day and you can't concentrate in

6726.48 --> 6732.0
general that could be it who knows

6750.119 --> 6754.598999999999
right yeah fi it's what you're

6751.28 --> 6754.599
describing I understand

6758.84 --> 6764.56
it I've experienced that what you're

6761.8 --> 6768.0
resonating with right there

6764.56 --> 6773.84
is a lot of people that were in the

6768.0 --> 6777.079
Catholic churches and all that where

6773.84 --> 6780.079
mental and emotional abuse happens not

6777.079 --> 6783.88
super overtly just like dominating and

6780.079 --> 6788.119
like talking down to people reducing

6783.88 --> 6791.28
reducing them to basically slaves

6788.119 --> 6794.159
mentally talking [ __ ] about them through

6791.28 --> 6797.5599999999995
church Authority and then people

6794.159 --> 6800.4
shutting off their emotions in a bit to

6797.56 --> 6803.76
like attempt to surrender themselves

6800.4 --> 6807.759999999999
spiritually into slavery spiritual

6803.76 --> 6809.96
slavery towards these priests and that

6807.76 --> 6812.0
specific feeling is what you're picking

6809.96 --> 6816.44
up on that's that cold feeling that's

6812.0 --> 6819.159
people shutting off their own life their

6816.44 --> 6821.839999999999
life force and dignity to try to

6819.159 --> 6823.879999999999
surrender to spiritual slavery that's

6821.84 --> 6827.159000000001
exactly that feeling that you're feeling

6823.88 --> 6831.400000000001
there that's cold that is associated

6827.159 --> 6832.799999999999
with cold it's it's spiritual slavery

6831.4 --> 6836.0
what that does to you that that's what

6832.8 --> 6841.0
you're feeling I've picked that up

6836.0 --> 6842.76
too like with older long used Catholic

6841.0 --> 6846.88
churches you feel that

6842.76 --> 6851.0
[ __ ] because that's happened a

6846.88 --> 6853.28
lot right in

6851.0 --> 6857.52
places especially when they're dressed

6853.28 --> 6859.44
up with wood and cloth and if it's all

6857.52 --> 6862.88
Stone it it doesn't happen so much if

6859.44 --> 6865.119
it's just called bare Stone but if

6862.88 --> 6868.76
there's like things like paintings

6865.119 --> 6873.199
around paper parchment any living

6868.76 --> 6875.679
material wood cloth that's always there

6873.199 --> 6878.36
it's going to

6875.679 --> 6880.639
absorb the resonance the simatic

6878.36 --> 6882.4
resonance the energy of the the feeling

6880.639 --> 6884.32
of those people and the process they're

6882.4 --> 6888.0
going it's going to resonate with what

6884.32 --> 6891.639
the people do there which

6888.0 --> 6894.52
is convert lay down their individual

6891.639 --> 6898.28
spiritual life force and

6894.52 --> 6900.76
dignity to submit to spiritual slavery

6898.28 --> 6903.159
to a priesthood and their

6900.76 --> 6905.84
Dogma that's what you're picking up now

6903.159 --> 6907.28
on if you're spiritually sensitive so I

6905.84 --> 6910.0
know exactly what you're talking about

6907.28 --> 6912.32
I've experienced that and has nothing to

6910.0 --> 6914.76
do with the simatic structures of the

6912.32 --> 6918.159
architecture it's taking place

6914.76 --> 6920.119000000001
in right because that Sensation will go

6918.159 --> 6923.0
away if

6920.119 --> 6925.92
suddenly an original

6923.0 --> 6927.679
designed Church organ which is like very

6925.92 --> 6928.96
rare to very hard to find out because

6927.679 --> 6931.4400000000005
they've all been replaced with

6928.96 --> 6934.4
modernized versions that don't work the

6931.44 --> 6935.638999999999
same anymore that are tuned differently

6934.4 --> 6938.92
but if you'd

6935.639 --> 6941.96
hear a church organ blast an original

6938.92 --> 6945.96
one through a place like that you would

6941.96 --> 6945.96
immediate that feeling would be swept

6946.48 --> 6953.678999999999
away and the original simatic function

6950.88 --> 6955.04
of that place would become palpable to

6953.679 --> 6957.96
you

6955.04 --> 6960.44
again but because that isn't being used

6957.96 --> 6962.92
and instead people are basically going

6960.44 --> 6967.32
through that spiritual

6962.92 --> 6970.56
transformation of surrendering to a

6967.32 --> 6974.799999999999
Dogma you're feeling that because that's

6970.56 --> 6974.8
the thing that's lingering the most

6976.64 --> 6979.829000000001
[Music]

6985.06 --> 6988.320000000001
[Music]

6986.639 --> 6990.88
I'm very glad to have this conversation

6988.32 --> 6995.679
with you by the way fiber

6990.88 --> 6995.679
outs I wish more people could join

7000.32 --> 7005.599
in but I'm glad that you're here at

7003.44 --> 7008.759999999999
least and I can have this conversation

7005.599 --> 7008.76
with you

7018.199 --> 7022.719
anybody else ever experienced that isg

7021.199 --> 7024.919999999999
have you ever experienced that have you

7022.719 --> 7028.88
ever walked into a church and

7024.92 --> 7028.88
felt bu something like

7031.639 --> 7036.599
that clutch you're still there have you

7034.719 --> 7039.92
ever experienced that clear have you

7036.599 --> 7041.719
ever experienced that anybody else

7039.92 --> 7043.32
besides fiber outs and myself have you

7041.719 --> 7047.32
ever experiened

7043.32 --> 7047.32
that please let me know in the

7056.84 --> 7063.56
chat I would say is that going to The

7060.719 --> 7066.599
Basilica living I wouldn't tell anybody

7063.56 --> 7070.320000000001
that's the building that I found God

7066.599 --> 7072.639
in right because your definition of God

7070.32 --> 7076.84
is Not defined

7072.639 --> 7080.2390000000005
by a political power like Catholicism

7076.84 --> 7083.360000000001
was yeah because that's what that would

7080.239 --> 7086.079
mean back then like a thousand years ago

7083.36 --> 7087.92
said I found God there that means I

7086.079 --> 7091.36
found my

7087.92 --> 7093.28
ruler a group of people that have that

7091.36 --> 7096.5199999999995
authority of God because I gave it to

7093.28 --> 7099.199
them and surrender to them so you found

7096.52 --> 7103.84
God there your

7099.199 --> 7108.638999999999
ruler that's what that meant back then

7103.84 --> 7111.84
yeah it's not our much more

7108.639 --> 7114.8
liberated individualist

7111.84 --> 7117.2390000000005
conceived version of God where every

7114.8 --> 7120.88
person has an individual relationship

7117.239 --> 7122.239
with God that didn't exist back then it

7120.88 --> 7124.719
might have been there but I mean there

7122.239 --> 7128.718999999999
was a giant

7124.719 --> 7130.96
religious political power that claimed

7128.719 --> 7132.599
Authority and would literally persecute

7130.96 --> 7136.679
and kill those

7132.599 --> 7141.639
as Heretics that would not attribute

7136.679 --> 7141.639
that political power to the

7143.079 --> 7146.079
church

7148.52 --> 7154.639
right so you got to realize that the the

7151.56 --> 7156.96
way people talked back then it's not

7154.639 --> 7158.52
because they're just [ __ ] and

7156.96 --> 7160.639
slavish it's

7158.52 --> 7163.56
because it wasn't

7160.639 --> 7166.92
free religion was not

7163.56 --> 7169.320000000001
free it was political and people would

7166.92 --> 7172.52
get savagely

7169.32 --> 7175.96
persecuted if they did not just fall in

7172.52 --> 7178.0
line and surrender to dogma and

7175.96 --> 7182.639
basically declare them like they're my

7178.0 --> 7182.639
God my master whatever they say

7192.27 --> 7195.4890000000005
[Music]

7198.48 --> 7201.5199999999995
okay hello diver

7205.32 --> 7208.599
D that's

7219.119 --> 7225.199
weird what this looks like a design MCAT

7229.92 --> 7237.32
program yeah there's more of those

7233.239 --> 7237.32
ancient structures that look like

7238.84 --> 7245.4800000000005
that although you got to realize that

7242.84 --> 7250.2390000000005
they didn't need computers like

7245.48 --> 7252.5199999999995
that they would just use tricks so

7250.239 --> 7254.799999999999
effectively they would

7252.52 --> 7256.400000000001
draw it like a computer except they do

7254.8 --> 7259.719
it all by

7256.4 --> 7262.44
hand a lot of it is a lost art like

7259.719 --> 7266.52
architecture used to be without

7262.44 --> 7269.96
computers then you have to use ropes and

7266.52 --> 7271.76
sticks and things and do the geometry

7269.96 --> 7273.84
and everything that way and they were

7271.76 --> 7276.320000000001
getting really good at it they were

7273.84 --> 7279.360000000001
masters of

7276.32 --> 7282.92
that and it's really a lost art most of

7279.36 --> 7286.199
it now because we just have computers

7282.92 --> 7286.1990000000005
that just calculate the

7295.56 --> 7302.8
model right well back

7299.159 --> 7306.04
then that was one person or a couple of

7302.8 --> 7309.1990000000005
people's life work like they'd spend

7306.04 --> 7311.679
their entire lives to perfect that

7309.199 --> 7313.4
architecture and they like they would be

7311.679 --> 7316.84
the living

7313.4 --> 7321.04
computer to calculate it all instead of

7316.84 --> 7321.04
having a computer just do it for you

7321.56 --> 7326.599
quickly and those people would be the

7324.36 --> 7329.92
only ones to even know how that

7326.599 --> 7332.119000000001
worked it would be their trade

7329.92 --> 7334.88
secret they were the

7332.119 --> 7337.88
Architects they were indispensable and

7334.88 --> 7341.32
that also gave them some power because

7337.88 --> 7341.32
they were indispensable

7347.84 --> 7351.4400000000005
right but we're

7352.04 --> 7358.28
talking a time period that's basically

7355.36 --> 7360.759999999999
technically lost to us I mean the

7358.28 --> 7364.679
tarian

7360.76 --> 7368.280000000001
age like we don't know the people that

7364.679 --> 7371.32
did that the history books tell

7368.28 --> 7373.679
us a set of indiv certain individuals

7371.32 --> 7376.599
did that but there's no actual evidence

7373.679 --> 7381.159
for that so we don't know who made

7376.599 --> 7381.159000000001
it or when it was made

7386.199 --> 7390.48
exactly they could have been very

7389.199 --> 7396.159
ancient

7390.48 --> 7396.159
structures that were just made to really

7396.599 --> 7403.639
last so if you're seeing some building

7399.44 --> 7406.04
somewhere some gothic church

7403.639 --> 7409.719
you should consider that maybe that

7406.04 --> 7409.719
building's like 2,000 years

7410.52 --> 7416.4800000000005
old like how do you know for sure it

7413.48 --> 7416.48
isn't

7432.32 --> 7438.199
tedly taught skills were tedly taught

7435.679 --> 7438.1990000000005
well it was

7438.76 --> 7442.360000000001
just teach your

7443.36 --> 7451.48
student oneon-one you had the master and

7446.239 --> 7451.48
you had the student and they like learn

7455.36 --> 7460.199
everything and then at some point the

7457.559 --> 7462.719
student would have learned everything

7460.199 --> 7465.558999999999
and would be able to

7462.719 --> 7469.36
do the entire function of the master

7465.559 --> 7472.559
although the master probably know more

7469.36 --> 7475.119
still Masters at some point like choose

7472.559 --> 7477.28
not to teach certain things to their

7475.119 --> 7479.5199999999995
student to still

7477.28 --> 7481.4
be

7479.52 --> 7483.599
indispensable because if you teach

7481.4 --> 7488.719
everything you can to others

7483.599 --> 7488.719
then then you're not needed anymore

7495.88 --> 7502.76
right but I mean once you learn enough

7500.44 --> 7506.159
techniques tricks architectural

7502.76 --> 7509.679
techniques then eventually like you

7506.159 --> 7512.159
might hold back some reset a stone

7509.679 --> 7514.719
accomplishment or technique on how to do

7512.159 --> 7516.799999999999
something within architecture but then

7514.719 --> 7519.84
if you taught everything else to a

7516.8 --> 7522.119000000001
student then they might even be able to

7519.84 --> 7523.360000000001
figure it out themselves with what

7522.119 --> 7526.4
they've

7523.36 --> 7529.199
learned as the master would have figured

7526.4 --> 7532.199
something out through what they have

7529.199 --> 7532.199
learned

7546.0 --> 7550.0
right right

7559.92 --> 7564.2390000000005
hey triple XX good to see you

7589.84 --> 7592.84
h

7624.52 --> 7630.96
nice weather yeah yeah yeah now it's

7628.36 --> 7635.04
beautiful I keep hearing Thunder though

7630.96 --> 7635.04
it's weird let me check

7649.48 --> 7654.159
apparently it's from all the way over

7651.199 --> 7657.4
there but I mean it doesn't really look

7654.159 --> 7659.5199999999995
like thick clouds there but yet I don't

7657.4 --> 7661.159
know maybe God's just putting a garbage

7659.52 --> 7663.4800000000005
can

7661.159 --> 7664.839999999999
out but that's sometimes what that

7663.48 --> 7667.959999999999
sounds

7664.84 --> 7671.639
like right like a

7667.96 --> 7673.4
cico like a plastic garbage thing with

7671.639 --> 7675.599
the two wheels that you can turn and

7673.4 --> 7677.799999999999
then if you roll over the bock that's

7675.599 --> 7680.599
exactly like how that

7677.8 --> 7684.320000000001
sounds so we say like oh that's God

7680.599 --> 7687.079
taking the garbage out like rolling the

7684.32 --> 7690.84
the garbage can up to the side

7687.079 --> 7690.84
street to the side of the

7695.32 --> 7700.799999999999
street it's going to rain

7698.159 --> 7702.598999999999
again yeah no that's fine I mean it's

7700.8 --> 7707.04
been plenty of warm

7702.599 --> 7707.04
and a little bit cooler I don't

7710.159 --> 7716.159
mind all right anyway everybody here

7712.639 --> 7719.96
don't forget to uh Rogan's it

7716.159 --> 7722.159
up and I could really use some support

7719.96 --> 7722.159
as

7725.639 --> 7732.8
well so I'm going to check my PayPal

7728.28 --> 7732.8
hopefully somebody there no

7733.36 --> 7741.04
please support me I can really use

7737.28 --> 7741.04
it I have certain

7744.88 --> 7750.28
bills and they still want to eat

7748.04 --> 7752.36
properly so even if just for the

7750.28 --> 7756.199
Illuminati cant

7752.36 --> 7759.159
fund some support would be great if you

7756.199 --> 7761.0
have it and thanks everybody that has

7759.159 --> 7764.48
been supporting me I really do

7782.52 --> 7785.52
Sanford

7786.28 --> 7793.32
okay and this is the chat on my channel

7790.4 --> 7793.32
oh oh you did

7793.599 --> 7798.679
oh thanks triple XX I appreciate that

7795.84 --> 7802.079

up number six all

7837.04 --> 7841.4
right when was I timed out I don't

7842.119 --> 7846.32
remember probably because you were

7847.92 --> 7853.559
distracting yeah I was trying to have a

7850.199 --> 7856.36
very serious discussion and people just

7853.559 --> 7859.599
inserting their nonrelated subject

7856.36 --> 7863.199
nonsense yeah eventually I'm going to

7859.599 --> 7863.1990000000005
just start timing people out for

7867.44 --> 7873.759999999999
that talking to George

7870.559 --> 7877.719
too yeah well tell George Sanford to

7873.76 --> 7880.360000000001
take down his stupid rwin

7877.719 --> 7882.2390000000005
videos you know that would be a good

7880.36 --> 7885.92
start he wants to be part the chat Stak

7885.92 --> 7889.1990000000005
videos very

7896.8 --> 7903.2390000000005
simple and don't hang around trolls

7899.76 --> 7906.360000000001
anymore that's also one do not

7903.239 --> 7906.36
appreciate if you do

7907.639 --> 7913.2390000000005
that ever argued about anything I doubt

7910.52 --> 7913.2390000000005

not all says so

7933.559 --> 7938.96
hey that's

7935.96 --> 7942.76
fine delete the stupid Arwin videos and

7938.96 --> 7942.76
he's welcome back

7949.84 --> 7954.04
and if you really mean it then donate to

7951.8 --> 7954.04
my

7954.48 --> 7962.959999999999
PayPal I'm a liar bye I don't

7958.96 --> 7965.52
know I don't remember he is

7962.96 --> 7967.719
dentist if that's your cue to go away

7965.52 --> 7970.119000000001
well

7967.719 --> 7974.159
bye I don't

7970.119 --> 7974.159
care for

8015.44 --> 8021.0199999999995
oh

8017.98 --> 8021.0199999999995
[Music]

8028.51 --> 8031.68
[Music]

8031.92 --> 8036.76
okay so yeah I don't know what George

8034.199 --> 8038.32
Sanford's talking about he's not even in

8036.76 --> 8040.88
my band

8038.32 --> 8046.079
list

8040.88 --> 8046.079
so I'm not the one stopping him

8064.56 --> 8067.9890000000005
[Music]

8078.92 --> 8082.76
good one M yeah no but I mean there's a

8080.92 --> 8085.079
lot of people that eventually just end

8082.76 --> 8085.079000000001
up

8085.32 --> 8091.119
unbanning I just wait some time with it

8088.36 --> 8093.92
because they need time to cool down

8091.119 --> 8096.598999999999
after they've severely misbehaved like

8093.92 --> 8102.28
people need like a month or sometimes

8096.599 --> 8102.28
half a year to just cool down and drop

8102.52 --> 8108.52
it Netherlands support

8106.199 --> 8111.839999999999
definitely support me through the PayPal

8108.52 --> 8111.84

that this is really clumsy how this

8536.52 --> 8543.24
works

8538.6 --> 8543.24
uh right let me check out my my PayPal

8544.359 --> 8548.800000000001
again hope everybody enjoyed the show I

8546.8 --> 8551.72
mean it's been interesting actually

8548.8 --> 8555.24
managed to talk about the title for a

8551.72 --> 8558.479
change hey thank you trip XX for the

8555.24 --> 8562.0
support I really appreciate

8558.479 --> 8566.64
that yeah I will definitely be able

8562.0 --> 8569.399
to replenish my Illuminati

8566.64 --> 8572.439
croissance with your support I really

8569.399 --> 8572.439
appreciate that

8573.6 --> 8579.6
thank you so much man for the support

8575.439 --> 8584.24
and I noticed the other day you were

8579.6 --> 8588.6
uh in QE live and going after the trolls

8584.24 --> 8591.28
that were like incessantly whining about

8588.6 --> 8593.279
me I kind of appreciate

8591.28 --> 8595.880000000001
it but I

8593.279 --> 8598.800000000001
mean I'm not even like going to comment

8595.88 --> 8601.599999999999
directly about it like they're so

8598.8 --> 8604.72
pitiful it's

8601.6 --> 8606.399000000001
pathetic Beyond imagining and like I

8604.72 --> 8609.24
don't have the patience to respond to

8606.399 --> 8612.039999999999
that at all but you were kind of a a

8609.24 --> 8615.439
cool lightning rod it did kind of help

8612.04 --> 8619.160000000002
so I do appreciate that that you did

8615.439 --> 8623.84
that and hey yeah us Dutch guys got to

8619.16 --> 8623.84
stick together I I actually agree to

8624.72 --> 8630.0
that Chad is dead no it's not dead

8636.52 --> 8639.479000000001
I don't know what you're talking

8656.52 --> 8662.359
about you wonder if he is xXx yeah he is

8660.0 --> 8662.359
clutch

8688.56 --> 8693.64
I can do more what I know what I don't

8692.08 --> 8696.16
know what that

8693.64 --> 8699.519999999999
means I appreciate the

8696.16 --> 8704.52
support but I mean I that doesn't mean

8699.52 --> 8704.52
that your English is particularly

8707.64 --> 8712.68
comprehensible yeah you relax CH chill

8710.96 --> 8715.679999999998
everything is fine I appreciate the

8712.68 --> 8715.68
support

8749.92 --> 8754.68
ask be wow what

8783.56 --> 8787.359
yeah but we were kind of having a

8785.04 --> 8791.0
conversation there

8787.359 --> 8792.720000000001
Triplex I was having a conversation with

8791.0 --> 8796.279
fiber oats

8792.72 --> 8799.599999999999
especially about our experiences in

8796.279 --> 8802.359
churches and why that is because a lot

8799.6 --> 8805.319
of those churches are actually

8802.359 --> 8806.84
simatic architecture bed structures that

8805.319 --> 8809.039999999999
have

8806.84 --> 8813.92
been

8809.04 --> 8815.960000000001
claimed by my religion and basically

8813.92 --> 8818.16
repurposed and we were talking about

8815.96 --> 8822.24
that

8818.16 --> 8825.64
since simatic architecture is like a

8822.24 --> 8828.84
core subject on today's

8825.64 --> 8831.0
show is the normal chat it's right there

8828.84 --> 8833.56
it's right

8831.0 --> 8835.56
there but you can't see it anymore

8833.56 --> 8838.56
because you're saying something every 30

8835.56 --> 8838.56
seconds

8849.439 --> 8855.720000000001
okay I'm I'm going to turn on slow mode

8851.56 --> 8855.72
now because you're just you keep saying

8858.0 --> 8864.24
stuff it's uh

8861.52 --> 8866.279
yeah I mean if you keep saying something

8864.24 --> 8868.64
every 30 seconds then yeah eventually

8866.279 --> 8871.84
you're only going to see yourself that's

8868.64 --> 8871.84
what happens

8886.72 --> 8892.92
yeah and when you do

8889.0 --> 8895.319
it it almost every single time somebody

8892.92 --> 8897.88
does that in my chat everybody else

8895.319 --> 8900.8
stops talking it's what happens when

8897.88 --> 8903.319
somebody does that anybody right when

8900.8 --> 8905.16
debatable D does it everybody else shuts

8903.319 --> 8908.119999999999
the hell up all of a sudden and they'll

8905.16 --> 8911.52
not talk back for like 20 minutes

8908.12 --> 8911.52
straight that's what

8913.56 --> 8918.72
happens it's just how it

8916.08 --> 8920.92
is it's nothing to do with anybody

8918.72 --> 8922.278999999999
personal somebody just suddenly starts

8920.92 --> 8924.76
talking and

8922.279 --> 8926.640000000001
yapping then everybody else suddenly

8924.76 --> 8930.12
shuts up for 20 minutes straight it's

8926.64 --> 8932.72
happened like every single damn time on

8930.12 --> 8932.720000000001
my early bir

8953.02 --> 8957.720000000001

9039.08 --> 9043.439
what

9040.439 --> 9047.92
happens

9043.439 --> 9047.92
hey thanks a lot

9059.0 --> 9064.359
no I'm not chatting with David Weiss

9062.12 --> 9068.800000000001
tonight is it

9064.359 --> 9071.640000000001

9115.08 --> 9120.08
but before that happens I'm still going

9116.8 --> 9120.08
to have my early bir show

9121.359 --> 9126.6
tomorrow oh look at

9124.04 --> 9132.319000000001
that somebody say

9126.6 --> 9135.319
anything oh some nobody just spoke up

9132.319 --> 9137.72
out of nowhere just the whne about

9135.319 --> 9140.479
getting banned yeah guess what happens

9137.72 --> 9143.358999999999
when you do that huh huh

9140.479 --> 9145.438999999998
yeah you get banned yeah I don't give a

9143.359 --> 9146.439
[ __ ] about your [ __ ] complaints about

9145.439 --> 9150.439
who I

9146.439 --> 9152.84
ban I wasn't talking to the people that

9150.439 --> 9156.279
I banned [ __ ]

9152.84 --> 9159.76
them yeah I was talking to the people

9156.279 --> 9162.399000000001
that before this I was having a fluent

9159.76 --> 9164.800000000001
conversation with that's who I was

9162.399 --> 9170.039999999999
talking to not the people that I kicked

9164.8 --> 9170.039999999999
out and don't give a [ __ ] about yeah

9180.16 --> 9184.6
Friday then that Eclipse did something

9182.56 --> 9188.319
to me I'm sure it did it did to a lot to

9184.6 --> 9192.84
a lot of people did something to

9188.319 --> 9192.84
me [ __ ] me up

9223.76 --> 9227.92
I don't know what the hell you're

9224.8 --> 9230.92
talking about Gary but don't do that

9227.92 --> 9230.92
yeah

9232.359 --> 9237.359
he didn't know what the hell was going

9234.08 --> 9239.76
on he just rolled in he supported me

9237.359 --> 9243.92
yeah I appreciate that

9239.76 --> 9246.880000000001
support where's your support Gary

9243.92 --> 9250.279
F where's your

9246.88 --> 9252.599999999999
support how did you earn the right to

9250.279 --> 9254.84
criticize somebody that's just coming in

9252.6 --> 9257.84
here supporting

9254.84 --> 9257.84
me

9258.04 --> 9264.080000000002
huh why don't you say send me some

9260.76 --> 9264.08
PayPal Gary

9266.68 --> 9273.92
Fe yeah Steven Jarvis Night Owl Night

9270.68 --> 9277.84
Owl 800m that's not an early bird show

9273.92 --> 9277.84
that's a night owl show

9294.479 --> 9297.56
yeah I don't know where the hell fibro

9296.16 --> 9299.76
went all of a

9297.56 --> 9302.88
sudden kind of disappointed I was having

9299.76 --> 9302.880000000001
a good conversation

9302.96 --> 9313.64
there like it's nice when somebody

9307.0 --> 9317.279
actually plays into the title it's like

9313.64 --> 9319.358999999999
wow they have a functioning brain and

9317.279 --> 9320.84
actually understand what I'm talking

9319.359 --> 9322.800000000001
about

9320.84 --> 9326.64
have something to say about it instead

9322.8 --> 9326.64
of like I went to the

9327.64 --> 9330.64
Planetarium

9332.68 --> 9340.319
yeah or this is way above my head like

9337.279 --> 9343.800000000001
oh okay

9340.319 --> 9346.039999999999
dumbass that makes you kind of dumb but

9343.8 --> 9346.039999999999
that's

9347.2 --> 9352.800000000001
fine it's not just about yeah it is

9349.84 --> 9356.6
right now though it is right now Steven

9352.8 --> 9359.599999999999
Jarvis yeah why don't you leave the

9356.6 --> 9364.24
telling what things are about and how my

9359.6 --> 9364.24
show works and how I should run it to

9364.52 --> 9368.52
me okay

9403.279 --> 9410.439
you just told you where fiber oats went

9405.68 --> 9413.279
that makes no sense you didn't

9410.439 --> 9413.279
you didn't say

9424.24 --> 9429.52
anything

9426.96 --> 9432.119999999999
wow can you guys hear this it's the

9429.52 --> 9435.16
thunder right there but I mean it

9432.12 --> 9438.68
doesn't look like a big black cloud does

9435.16 --> 9441.16
it I mean yeah you could think of that

9438.68 --> 9442.960000000001
as cloudy it's certainly is darker than

9441.16 --> 9445.92
over

9442.96 --> 9449.119999999999
there but I

9445.92 --> 9452.12
mean it's weird just hearing thunder

9449.12 --> 9454.560000000001
coming out of that I mean

9452.12 --> 9457.960000000001
really

9454.56 --> 9457.96
where where's the

9459.96 --> 9462.96
Thunder

9464.56 --> 9471.359
weird hey by Rose good to see you glad

9468.04 --> 9471.359
you're back

9474.279 --> 9478.640000000001
you're just worry about how you're

9475.64 --> 9478.64
getting off Gilligan

9480.0 --> 9483.279
Island that's

9490.6 --> 9494.800000000001
hilarious right I'm going to take a

9492.319 --> 9497.0
two-minute break and I'll be right

9494.8 --> 9501.438999999998
back and then I'm probably going to run

9497.0 --> 9501.439
out the show don't go anywhere

9528.439 --> 9531.439
this

9558.359 --> 9562.359
e e

9620.399 --> 9622.92
and the

9624.68 --> 9631.68
back did you hear whether or not I was

9627.68 --> 9634.800000000001
why specific subject for night all show

9631.68 --> 9639.359
uh it's going to be slightly more

9634.8 --> 9642.599999999999
free but maybe I'll bring up this

9639.359 --> 9644.479000000001
subject I mean it's certainly a subject

9642.6 --> 9648.24
that we're going to be mutually

9644.479 --> 9651.08
interested in and David Wise might have

9648.24 --> 9654.16
some good source

9651.08 --> 9658.16
even for that may have collected some

9654.16 --> 9660.8
over the years but the thing is I I

9658.16 --> 9662.08
would actually like to Duke it out a bit

9660.8 --> 9666.278999999999
carefully as

9662.08 --> 9670.52
friends to get this understanding about

9666.279 --> 9674.16
ether and like what ether is definitely

9670.52 --> 9676.800000000001
not but that there is something that

9674.16 --> 9680.08
would be called ether that's

9676.8 --> 9684.759999999998
rather well Advan

9680.08 --> 9686.92
anced sound and magnetic based

9684.76 --> 9689.880000000001
engineering CU that's what it is right

9686.92 --> 9689.88
it's sematic

9690.56 --> 9695.08
architecture like that's what that

9692.439 --> 9697.439
actually like a better word for ether

9695.08 --> 9702.64
what is understood among flat earthers

9697.439 --> 9706.12
and all that as ether should be

9702.64 --> 9708.96
called simatic

9706.12 --> 9711.240000000002
architecture and i' I'd like to argue

9708.96 --> 9711.24
that

9714.279 --> 9720.04
like to argue that with David see what

9716.64 --> 9721.8
he thinks about it right but yeah we'll

9720.04 --> 9726.12
we'll see what

9721.8 --> 9729.519999999999
happens and I will have a talk with

9726.12 --> 9733.279
him hopefully before we start the show

9729.52 --> 9733.279
on Friday evening

9745.12 --> 9749.399000000001
that runs a channel called by

9752.0 --> 9758.359
what what what is that what are you

9754.479 --> 9758.358999999999
talking about F roads

9780.52 --> 9783.52
oh

9786.92 --> 9794.56
okay

9789.76 --> 9797.319
H okay it looks like a tartarian

9794.56 --> 9799.88
channel okay I'll have a take a look at

9797.319 --> 9802.399
that

9799.88 --> 9802.399
doesn't do

9802.6 --> 9809.960000000001
lives does

9805.08 --> 9812.16
do uploads every now and then

9809.96 --> 9815.759999999998
okay I'll check it

9812.16 --> 9815.76
out my lunch

9819.88 --> 9825.24
break it's like 20 minutes I guess

9823.359 --> 9829.6
that's what it's intended for 20 minutes

9825.24 --> 9834.16
of info info stuff as a lunch break it's

9829.6 --> 9834.16
a wise sponsored YouTube channel

9839.52 --> 9844.880000000001
okay sponsored are you sure sponsored or

9842.6 --> 9844.880000000001
just

9853.439 --> 9858.6
Affiliated does it talk about ether

9860.96 --> 9865.759999999998
oh it's funny okay well I dude sounds

9863.68 --> 9868.880000000001
interesting I'll check it

9865.76 --> 9873.12
out I mean what what could it hurt to

9868.88 --> 9873.119999999999
just check out like 20 minutes at

9881.72 --> 9889.16
least

9884.359 --> 9891.359
okay uh sense critic

9889.16 --> 9892.6
ether is pure Consciousness oh really

9891.359 --> 9897.960000000001
Define

9892.6 --> 9901.479000000001
that Define that unlimited frequency

9897.96 --> 9904.08
generation what's an unlimited

9901.479 --> 9907.438999999998
frequency everything not cast down to

9904.08 --> 9910.8
the land of entropy oh so nothing

9907.439 --> 9913.68
physical then really so what is it then

9910.8 --> 9915.8
nothing nothing that you can point out

9913.68 --> 9918.04
yeah you can't define

9915.8 --> 9919.679999999998
consciousness there's no such thing as

9918.04 --> 9921.640000000001
Unlimited frequenc

9919.68 --> 9923.6
quency that that's like

9921.64 --> 9926.358999999999
self-contradictory the whole thing about

9923.6 --> 9929.0
a frequency is that it's specific if

9926.359 --> 9931.52
it's unlimited then it's not a

9929.0 --> 9933.479
frequency yeah and if something is not

9931.52 --> 9936.16
cast down to the land of entropy then

9933.479 --> 9937.92
how are we going to attain any

9936.16 --> 9940.92
information about

9937.92 --> 9943.76
it yeah that makes no damn sense what

9940.92 --> 9947.399
you just said Sans

9943.76 --> 9949.76
critic it's all and everything oh but I

9947.399 --> 9952.319
thought that it was everything not cast

9949.76 --> 9955.0
down to the land of entropy and now it

9952.319 --> 9959.0
is everything so it's everything but

9955.0 --> 9961.24
it's not everything sounds like you're

9959.0 --> 9965.56
contradicting yourself

9961.24 --> 9968.08
fundamentally there Sans

9965.56 --> 9971.96
critic yeah this is starting to sound

9968.08 --> 9975.56
like the Trinity talk like oh he's the

9971.96 --> 9977.96
father and the Son and the Holy Ghost

9975.56 --> 9980.519999999999
and and he's a man and he's God and he's

9977.96 --> 9982.039999999999
his own father and and like oh wait so

9980.52 --> 9985.04
that's just

9982.04 --> 9987.720000000001
complete illogical self-contradicting

9985.04 --> 9989.84
nonsense then is it yeah it kind of

9987.72 --> 9992.96
sounds like that Sans

9989.84 --> 9996.479
critic yeah and that's my issue with Ean

9992.96 --> 9999.519999999999
that's the issue that the Nathan Oley

9996.479 --> 10002.56
crowd and Quantum eraser has with issue

9999.52 --> 10007.439
with ether is their issue with it

10002.56 --> 10010.439
because this is literally in your face

10007.439 --> 10010.439
self-contradictory

10013.0 --> 10019.08
nonsense yeah nobody made you say that

10016.279 --> 10023.640000000001
nobody made you contradict yourself you

10019.08 --> 10026.359
did that you contradicted yourself

10023.64 --> 10026.358999999999
through your own

10027.479 --> 10033.08
actions what would you know obviously

10030.479 --> 10035.679999999998
nothing I don't know what you know but I

10033.08 --> 10038.279
do know that what you wrote down

10035.68 --> 10041.6
contradicts itself yeah your second

10038.279 --> 10045.399000000001
sentence contradicted your first

10041.6 --> 10048.319
one yeah it's not about what you know

10045.399 --> 10050.519999999999
it's about what you said and what you

10048.319 --> 10052.278999999999
said contradicted

10050.52 --> 10055.720000000001
itself

10052.279 --> 10056.92
yeah so yeah I don't know what you know

10055.72 --> 10058.679999999998
I just know that that was

10056.92 --> 10060.279
self-contradicting and it makes no

10058.68 --> 10064.0
[ __ ] sense

10060.279 --> 10067.2
whatsoever and uh yeah hey simatic

10064.0 --> 10069.8
architecture is a real thing it's a very

10067.2 --> 10073.359
Advanced human engineering based

10069.8 --> 10074.56
on natural occurring structures that

10073.359 --> 10078.720000000001
come out of

10074.56 --> 10080.68
sound and has an influence on water and

10078.72 --> 10084.119999999999
living things and it's really amazing

10080.68 --> 10087.08
it's amazing simatic architecture and

10084.12 --> 10089.640000000001
what can you do with it a lot and people

10087.08 --> 10093.359
in the past Architects have done with it

10089.64 --> 10097.439
a lot amazing influences healing

10093.359 --> 10100.6
devices energy generation that basically

10097.439 --> 10102.319
comes out of nowhere just it's like

10100.6 --> 10105.479000000001
ultra

10102.319 --> 10109.519999999999
F or however you say that

10105.479 --> 10112.88
fun but like Ultra Advanced like super

10109.52 --> 10115.800000000001
super super Advanced punctu that just

10112.88 --> 10118.479
like the thing being there the way it is

10115.8 --> 10121.479
being in its presence you just like get

10118.479 --> 10123.92
caught in this energy that's naturally

10121.479 --> 10125.039999999999
built up just by the architecture the

10123.92 --> 10126.92
shape of the

10125.04 --> 10128.960000000001
architecture and then you get the

10126.92 --> 10133.12
benefit you get to regenerate you get

10128.96 --> 10135.319
purify you feel stronger your spirit is

10133.12 --> 10138.84
revitalized

10135.319 --> 10141.359
charged and it's all thanks to simatic

10138.84 --> 10144.76
architecture yeah it's nothing to do

10141.359 --> 10146.0
with ether yeah nothing to do with all

10144.76 --> 10149.24
the thing

10146.0 --> 10151.84
that's everything but it's not

10149.24 --> 10153.8
everything at the same time and it's has

10151.84 --> 10156.359
to do with Consciousness even though you

10153.8 --> 10159.08
can't technically define

10156.359 --> 10160.960000000001
consciousness yeah and it's definitely

10159.08 --> 10163.84
not an unlimited

10160.96 --> 10165.96
frequency since that doesn't mean

10163.84 --> 10168.12
anything and a frequency is only a

10165.96 --> 10169.278999999999
frequency because it is very specific

10168.12 --> 10172.6
and not

10169.279 --> 10175.04
unlimited yeah there is no unlimited

10172.6 --> 10177.960000000001
frequency because that contradicts the

10175.04 --> 10180.76
very nature of what frequency

10177.96 --> 10184.319
means yeah so none of that has to do

10180.76 --> 10189.16
with anything real simatic architecture

10184.319 --> 10191.8
however is absolutely provable

10189.16 --> 10194.88
technology that has been developed by

10191.8 --> 10196.92
humans in the far past and that

10194.88 --> 10202.239
technology and the application of it has

10196.92 --> 10202.239
been suppressed and gradually removed

10202.439 --> 10207.720000000001
downplayed the structures

10205.0 --> 10210.399
repurposed to mask the original

10207.72 --> 10210.399
influence of

10210.88 --> 10217.119999999999
him

10212.64 --> 10221.119999999999
yeah simatic architecture it's

10217.12 --> 10224.08
real it'ss absolutely real and it's

10221.12 --> 10228.239000000001
man-made yeah simatic architecture

10224.08 --> 10228.239
doesn't just naturally come forth from

10229.92 --> 10233.72
nature is ether

10234.479 --> 10237.84
infinite what's

10238.88 --> 10244.64
ether I mean if it's all these things

10241.6 --> 10247.279
that contradict itself as I described

10244.64 --> 10249.72
earlier if that is either to you then

10247.279 --> 10251.560000000001
well is this self contradicting thing

10249.72 --> 10253.72
that obviously doesn't exist because

10251.56 --> 10256.199999999999
it's self-contradicting is that infinite

10253.72 --> 10258.199999999999
is it an infinite

10256.2 --> 10260.439
self-contradiction I don't think

10258.2 --> 10263.68
self-contradictions are infinite I think

10260.439 --> 10265.68
that they don't exist because they're

10263.68 --> 10268.76
self-contradicting it's like a paradox

10265.68 --> 10271.720000000001
yes it's like is a paradox infinite no

10268.76 --> 10276.04
no a paradox doesn't exist that's the

10271.72 --> 10280.88
point of being a paradox is that you can

10276.04 --> 10283.960000000001
conceive of it but it doesn't actually

10280.88 --> 10286.679999999998
exist you can describe it through

10283.96 --> 10291.08
mathematics but it can't physically

10286.68 --> 10293.319
exist that's the point of a

10291.08 --> 10297.039999999999
self-contradiction so it's finite no

10293.319 --> 10297.039999999999
it's not anything there is no

10297.72 --> 10307.0
ether it's a conception it's a

10302.399 --> 10310.358999999999
concept ether is what is thought of to

10307.0 --> 10313.319
be there in the face of

10310.359 --> 10317.08
experiencing simatic architecture and

10313.319 --> 10319.119999999999
its influences on the material realm

10317.08 --> 10320.479
which includes the energy of the

10319.12 --> 10325.2
material

10320.479 --> 10327.119999999999
realm yeah and the material realm can

10325.2 --> 10331.2
potentially

10327.12 --> 10332.880000000001
yield an abundance of energy without

10331.2 --> 10335.640000000001
costing a lot of

10332.88 --> 10339.239
energy but that doesn't mean that ether

10335.64 --> 10341.76
exists to do that it just means

10339.239 --> 10346.199999999999
means simatic

10341.76 --> 10348.64
architecture does that it builds the

10346.2 --> 10352.6
energy it

10348.64 --> 10355.599999999999
amplifies vital vitalizing

10352.6 --> 10356.960000000001
functions it has a positive influence on

10355.6 --> 10360.439
life and on

10356.96 --> 10363.239
water yeah that's not

10360.439 --> 10366.68
ether it's not a

10363.239 --> 10370.439
thing separate from the actual

10366.68 --> 10370.439
architecture that does that

10371.6 --> 10376.08
it's the architecture that does that

10373.64 --> 10378.64
yeah without the simatic architecture it

10376.08 --> 10383.8
doesn't happen it only happens when the

10378.64 --> 10387.319
architecture is there yeah it's a

10383.8 --> 10390.72
man made

10387.319 --> 10394.239
influence man makes the simatic

10390.72 --> 10395.76
architecture the simatic architecture

10394.239 --> 10399.319
influences

10395.76 --> 10402.960000000001
energy life and water

10399.319 --> 10404.278999999999
yeah without the man making the simatic

10402.96 --> 10406.679999999998
architecture

10404.279 --> 10407.960000000001
somehow none of these influences come

10406.68 --> 10411.68
into

10407.96 --> 10415.0
being yeah it's man-made it doesn't

10411.68 --> 10417.439
happen naturally there are no natural

10415.0 --> 10419.479
simatic structures that completely just

10417.439 --> 10421.279
form through entropy all by themselves

10419.479 --> 10423.319
it's just oh just just simatic

10421.279 --> 10426.08
structures they're just

10423.319 --> 10428.039999999999
there right rocks that are just like

10426.08 --> 10430.239
Star fortresses they just like yeah you

10428.04 --> 10433.84
we just happen to find Star Fortress

10430.239 --> 10438.92
shaped rocks in nature just bump into

10433.84 --> 10442.880000000001
them right no no you don't what you do

10438.92 --> 10444.8
bump into is manmade structures that

10442.88 --> 10448.239
have these

10444.8 --> 10450.119999999999
influences yeah it's called simatic

10448.239 --> 10453.119999999999
architecture and it's

10450.12 --> 10456.0
man-made it's not a

10453.12 --> 10459.0
field that has self-contradicting

10456.0 --> 10459.0
properties

10459.08 --> 10462.72
that's at the root cause of

10463.16 --> 10469.279
that it's the architecture that does it

10467.04 --> 10474.080000000002
it's the shapes that were assembled and

10469.279 --> 10476.76
created and designed by men based on

10474.08 --> 10480.68
Inspirations of visuals of natur like

10476.76 --> 10484.76
sound based simatic patterns yeah

10480.68 --> 10484.76
inspired not naturally

10485.359 --> 10492.0
created because simatic structures don't

10488.479 --> 10492.0
just come into being out of

10497.56 --> 10502.92
nothing yeah yeah I know the definition

10500.08 --> 10504.239
of simatic Sr critic you don't have to

10502.92 --> 10509.72
tell me

10504.239 --> 10509.72
that no dupons it isn't

10520.0 --> 10524.56
I don't know where you picked up that

10521.88 --> 10524.56
thought but that's

10525.64 --> 10530.599999999999
ridiculous sun and moon don't move

10528.6 --> 10532.880000000001
through anything there's no proof they

10530.6 --> 10535.640000000001
have a location if they don't there's no

10532.88 --> 10538.319
proof of a location then they don't move

10535.64 --> 10540.96
and they don't move through

10538.319 --> 10543.359
anything there's just an appearance of a

10540.96 --> 10546.479
sun and moon there's no proof of

10543.359 --> 10548.52
movement other than angular apparent

10546.479 --> 10550.64
movement

10548.52 --> 10552.960000000001
not through anything because it doesn't

10550.64 --> 10552.96
have a

10565.6 --> 10571.04
location energy and frequency got the

10568.68 --> 10571.04
red

10572.359 --> 10577.68
card don't know what the hell you're

10574.359 --> 10577.68
talking about

10584.279 --> 10588.479000000001
I just responded to what you said you

10586.12 --> 10590.160000000002
said infinite frequency which is

10588.479 --> 10592.08
literally a

10590.16 --> 10594.84
contradiction there is no infinite

10592.08 --> 10596.72
frequency a frequency it's a frequency

10594.84 --> 10599.16
it can't be

10596.72 --> 10600.84
infinite if it's infinite then it can't

10599.16 --> 10603.52
be a

10600.84 --> 10605.279
frequency a frequency is specific that's

10603.52 --> 10608.800000000001
what makes it a frequency if it's

10605.279 --> 10612.279
infinite then it can't be a frequency

10608.8 --> 10613.358999999999
yeah and energy energy is there it comes

10612.279 --> 10615.880000000001
from

10613.359 --> 10618.279
things it is present we don't know how

10615.88 --> 10622.119999999999
it gets there but we do know that

10618.279 --> 10625.2
through simatic architecture you can

10622.12 --> 10627.04
utilize and even amplify the energy

10625.2 --> 10629.319000000001
that's already

10627.04 --> 10633.0
there

10629.319 --> 10635.16
yeah it's just there now you could think

10633.0 --> 10637.399
of that energy oh but the energy comes

10635.16 --> 10641.039999999999
from ether ether yeah but you have no

10637.399 --> 10643.96
proof of that you're just calling ether

10641.04 --> 10646.800000000001
you're Conjuring it and then claiming

10643.96 --> 10650.519999999999
that it is the source of the energy that

10646.8 --> 10652.679999999998
is palpably there measurably there and

10650.52 --> 10655.68
we don't know how it is

10652.68 --> 10657.2
there but it

10655.68 --> 10661.720000000001
is

10657.2 --> 10665.08
yeah there is no ether it's just a

10661.72 --> 10667.72
concept it's lazy as a

10665.08 --> 10668.72
concept and it tends to make a lot of

10667.72 --> 10671.8
people

10668.72 --> 10673.88
contradict themselves wildly and think

10671.8 --> 10677.0
that they're perfectly okay to

10673.88 --> 10680.16
contradict themselves wildly as they try

10677.0 --> 10683.92
to describe ether yeah it's not okay

10680.16 --> 10687.0
it's not okay to contradict yourself

10683.92 --> 10690.64
wildly as you try to describe a concept

10687.0 --> 10694.0
yeah that should be a gigantic red flag

10690.64 --> 10695.039999999999
in your face like look what came rolling

10694.0 --> 10698.439
out of

10695.04 --> 10700.080000000002
you look at what you're saying are you

10698.439 --> 10703.08
hearing yourself

10700.08 --> 10706.439
talk you think that that's

10703.08 --> 10708.12
okay to say things that are blatantly

10706.439 --> 10711.880000000001
and

10708.12 --> 10713.92
provably described to be

10711.88 --> 10716.119999999999
self-contradicting and you hold on to

10713.92 --> 10718.319
that opinion do you to

10716.12 --> 10720.52
self-contradicting opinions do you do

10718.319 --> 10724.199999999999
that you should you should have yourself

10720.52 --> 10729.52
checked out for that that's not

10724.2 --> 10732.6
okay it's generally regarded as ins

10729.52 --> 10734.12
when you hold on to self-contradicting

10732.6 --> 10736.359
Concepts and think that they are

10734.12 --> 10739.160000000002
legitimate even though you can prove

10736.359 --> 10740.84
that it's self-contradicting that's not

10739.16 --> 10743.92
okay

10740.84 --> 10745.399
yeah why not just stick to what we know

10743.92 --> 10750.399
is

10745.399 --> 10754.358999999999
real like simatic architecture and its

10750.399 --> 10756.16
influences yeah manmade simatic

10754.359 --> 10758.880000000001
architecture and its influences which

10756.16 --> 10760.76
are amazing yeah it's architecture it's

10758.88 --> 10763.438999999998
just like look what we can do with

10760.76 --> 10766.12
modern engineering it's pretty

10763.439 --> 10767.92
amazing it's pretty cool look at

10766.12 --> 10769.560000000001
electronics and computers look at what

10767.92 --> 10772.2
we've accomplished with that that's

10769.56 --> 10775.319
amazing yeah it's man-made though it's

10772.2 --> 10777.16
man-made architecture

10775.319 --> 10780.479
microarchitecture

10777.16 --> 10782.68
yeah microelectronic architecture look

10780.479 --> 10785.84
it's amazing what we can do and we let

10782.68 --> 10789.56
the computers do the architecture for US

10785.84 --> 10792.16
based on what we learned

10789.56 --> 10794.359
about computer chip

10792.16 --> 10796.64
architecture let the computers that we

10794.359 --> 10800.439
designed with that knowledge do the rest

10796.64 --> 10802.399
of the designing for us now right and

10800.439 --> 10804.960000000001
way in the past there was a

10802.399 --> 10808.399
different direction of architecture it

10804.96 --> 10812.16
was simatic architecture utilizing the

10808.399 --> 10815.84
natural energies through shapes to

10812.16 --> 10818.84
charge life and water naturally with the

10815.84 --> 10820.960000000001
energy that's already there and simply

10818.84 --> 10825.12
not letting the energy

10820.96 --> 10828.88
deplete but utilizing and amplifying it

10825.12 --> 10831.439
naturally simatic architecture very

10828.88 --> 10833.679999999998
advanced

10831.439 --> 10836.239
technology that's a completely of a

10833.68 --> 10839.52
different nature as

10836.239 --> 10842.479
electronics and it's amazing and it has

10839.52 --> 10845.68
absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with

10842.479 --> 10847.64
ether because ether is a concept that

10845.68 --> 10849.0
makes no sense there's no evidence for

10847.64 --> 10851.319
it

10849.0 --> 10853.88
and when you let people try to describe

10851.319 --> 10856.319
what ether is and explain it they end up

10853.88 --> 10858.278999999999
contradicting themselves within the same

10856.319 --> 10862.08
sentence and then when you point that

10858.279 --> 10865.640000000001
out they just shrug like I don't

10862.08 --> 10868.359
know because it makes no sense it's a

10865.64 --> 10871.399
concept that's not grounded in physical

10868.359 --> 10875.880000000001
reality has no scientific

10871.399 --> 10880.0
legitimacy and any good engineer that

10875.88 --> 10882.64
dabbles into the idea of of ether should

10880.0 --> 10886.2
be very wary not to declare it to be an

10882.64 --> 10890.0
actual thing or especially scientific

10886.2 --> 10892.439
because they will be regarded by people

10890.0 --> 10895.279
that matter as pseudo scientists because

10892.439 --> 10898.2
it is pseudo science there's no proof

10895.279 --> 10902.16
for it it's just a concept it's like a

10898.2 --> 10905.12
unifying overarching idea that doesn't

10902.16 --> 10908.439
really fit into anything and it's all

10905.12 --> 10911.04
derived from manmade devices is not

10908.439 --> 10912.6
naturally occurring

10911.04 --> 10915.399000000001
phenomena

10912.6 --> 10918.319
yeah it's much better to just call it

10915.399 --> 10920.08
the influence of simatic architecture

10918.319 --> 10923.399
because that's

10920.08 --> 10926.439
literally what is there what has been

10923.399 --> 10930.358999999999
made what does the

10926.439 --> 10932.08
things that are so magical to US

10930.359 --> 10936.359
amplifying

10932.08 --> 10939.6
Energy revitalizing yeah it's simatic

10936.359 --> 10941.880000000001
architecture engineer in

10939.6 --> 10944.399000000001
manmade not a naturally occurring

10941.88 --> 10946.199999999999
phenomenon not some field just sitting

10944.399 --> 10950.519999999999
there in the

10946.2 --> 10950.52
background that cannot be

10951.359 --> 10956.720000000001
proven Let It

10953.479 --> 10960.96
Go stick to what is real it's amazing

10956.72 --> 10963.76
enough as it is yeah no need to make up

10960.96 --> 10963.759999999998
[ __ ] that you can't

10965.84 --> 10969.8
prove from Wikipedia

10968.52 --> 10974.2
oh

10969.8 --> 10974.199999999999
wow now that's completely useless

10976.319 --> 10983.439
duper turn off slow mode if you want a

10978.96 --> 10985.8
useful discussion no how about I don't

10983.439 --> 10990.04
how about you just take a little bit

10985.8 --> 10992.84
more of time to actually put a logically

10990.04 --> 10995.6
reason out sentence

10992.84 --> 10998.92
together if you have any I doubt you

10995.6 --> 10998.92
that you do

11001.88 --> 11007.92
CU you haven't addressed anything that I

11004.76 --> 11010.2
said even though it's extremely

11007.92 --> 11011.92
relevant to what has been discussed what

11010.2 --> 11014.960000000001
you brought to the table you haven't

11011.92 --> 11014.960000000001
rebutted what I

11016.8 --> 11023.0
said at all you haven't addressed what I

11020.319 --> 11023.0
said at

11023.04 --> 11028.76
all you

11024.76 --> 11028.76
haven't admitted

11029.76 --> 11035.359
your

11031.399 --> 11040.519999999999
error so I don't see why I should do

11035.359 --> 11040.52
anything that you say Sans critic

11062.64 --> 11068.88
you got to go hungry okay

11065.56 --> 11072.039999999999
duper it's what some ancient people how

11068.88 --> 11072.039999999999
the hell would you know that

11074.279 --> 11081.0
derer it's what modern people have

11078.279 --> 11083.640000000001
written about what they believe some

11081.0 --> 11088.279
ancient people that

11083.64 --> 11091.039999999999
probably didn't even exist

11088.279 --> 11093.84
it's just telling you what they think

11091.04 --> 11093.84
ancient people

11095.8 --> 11103.56
said oh if you have to wait for to

11099.68 --> 11107.960000000001
reply what one minute one minute's too

11103.56 --> 11110.399
much for you I don't think so I think

11107.96 --> 11113.039999999999
you just ran out of

11110.399 --> 11117.72
argumentation concerning The Ether

11113.04 --> 11120.640000000001
because there isn't any yeah I mean you

11117.72 --> 11122.519999999999
were perfectly capable of telling me

11120.64 --> 11126.278999999999
what ether is and you use that

11122.52 --> 11128.720000000001
opportunity to write three massively

11126.279 --> 11131.0
self-contradicting statements about

11128.72 --> 11134.358999999999
it that like

11131.0 --> 11136.479
literally made you dig a giant hole for

11134.359 --> 11139.04
yourself and you haven't addressed it

11136.479 --> 11141.88
ever since

11139.04 --> 11148.12
yeah don't think you need

11141.88 --> 11148.119999999999
a more than one minute between sentences

11149.92 --> 11156.16
but yeah you can bail as as much as you

11152.76 --> 11159.239
like I mean I would too if I made a

11156.16 --> 11161.359
statement that is so blatantly

11159.239 --> 11163.92
self-contradicting I would want to find

11161.359 --> 11167.84
an excuse to get the hell out

11163.92 --> 11170.2
too right better than just like with

11167.84 --> 11172.6
humiliation admit like holy [ __ ] what

11170.2 --> 11176.04
the [ __ ] did I just say yeah that is

11172.6 --> 11178.800000000001
[ __ ] I agree I'm sorry I'm sorry for

11176.04 --> 11181.239000000001
saying something that's [ __ ] stupid

11178.8 --> 11184.679999999998
maybe you're right Arn maybe it is just

11181.239 --> 11186.72
a man-made device based effect that you

11184.68 --> 11188.880000000001
could call simatic architecture that

11186.72 --> 11193.599999999999
actually does all these things

11188.88 --> 11195.438999999998
provably yeah and not some undefined

11193.6 --> 11197.399000000001
self-contradicting conception that

11195.439 --> 11200.399
cannot be

11197.399 --> 11200.399
measured

11201.68 --> 11208.16
h no no I'm the show host

11208.319 --> 11212.239
I'm not going to put myself on one

11210.439 --> 11214.52
sentence prevented

11212.239 --> 11217.439
dumbass why don't you actually have

11214.52 --> 11220.800000000001
something worth saying yeah you're

11217.439 --> 11223.0
spending this one sentence per minute on

11220.8 --> 11226.679999999998
whining and complaining now instead of

11223.0 --> 11229.279
making an argument or progressing the

11226.68 --> 11233.0
argument yeah giving a confession

11229.279 --> 11235.68
admitting to your error moving on giving

11233.0 --> 11239.72
me a better argument no you're using

11235.68 --> 11243.84
that one sentence a minute to

11239.72 --> 11247.64
complain sounds like you ran out of

11243.84 --> 11247.64
argumentation ah

11265.72 --> 11273.039999999999
H toxic man

11268.319 --> 11274.64
so toxic oh he's so

11273.04 --> 11278.160000000002
toxic

11274.64 --> 11282.278999999999
oh yeah I'm afraid that's your own

11278.16 --> 11284.239
toxicity yeah that's your own

11282.279 --> 11286.560000000001
self-contradiction that you entered the

11284.239 --> 11291.119999999999
chat with that's biting you in the ass

11286.56 --> 11293.84
yeah it hurts doesn't it hurts I

11291.12 --> 11295.279
know complaining about formats all you

11293.84 --> 11298.16
got left

11295.279 --> 11300.92
now yeah just like a regular

11298.16 --> 11303.72
Ballard that's what they end up doing

11300.92 --> 11305.88
when they get cornered oh let's complain

11303.72 --> 11309.0
about the format oh you're not doing it

11305.88 --> 11311.119999999999
right oh oh how about you stick to the

11309.0 --> 11314.04
subject

11311.12 --> 11316.0
huh how about you try to defend your

11314.04 --> 11320.160000000002
ether

11316.0 --> 11323.52
claim with your infinite frequency huh

11320.16 --> 11327.76
you didn't even address that blatant

11323.52 --> 11328.880000000001
idiocy no problem bye yeah bye bye bye

11327.76 --> 11332.800000000001
[ __ ]

11328.88 --> 11332.8
with don't come back you

11333.68 --> 11338.68
hear yeah come back when you have some

11336.08 --> 11341.12
evidence for ether or could Define it

11338.68 --> 11345.12
properly without contradicting

11341.12 --> 11345.12
yourself huh

11348.55 --> 11351.679999999998
[Music]

11364.84 --> 11369.04
no that was

11366.0 --> 11372.279
nice at least I got a bit of a back and

11369.04 --> 11374.52
forth sort of of course it ended up like

11372.279 --> 11374.52
this

11374.96 --> 11381.679999999998
because you can't stand up to

11378.04 --> 11384.640000000001
this all ether rites know they have

11381.68 --> 11387.960000000001
nothing yeah have

11384.64 --> 11390.278999999999
nothing and I'm not even like doing a

11387.96 --> 11392.839999999998
Nathan oakle strategy or

11390.279 --> 11395.640000000001
anything just pointing out exactly what

11392.84 --> 11398.359
you're saying that's

11395.64 --> 11400.76
it yeah even saying like hey there's

11398.359 --> 11402.92
something there there's something there

11400.76 --> 11405.6
yeah it's called simatic

11402.92 --> 11409.76
architecture man makes

11405.6 --> 11412.12
it and that production of man then has a

11409.76 --> 11415.56
very significant influence it's pretty

11412.12 --> 11417.439
amazing and it's palpable palpable

11415.56 --> 11418.239
enough that it's not even admitted to be

11417.439 --> 11421.84
real

11418.239 --> 11424.76
thing out there and suppressed and

11421.84 --> 11426.84
covered up and even torn down these

11424.76 --> 11429.439
structures yeah these simatic

11426.84 --> 11430.960000000001
architecture structures we don't even

11429.439 --> 11434.08
know how they were built and they get

11430.96 --> 11435.839999999998
torn down not to be remade not to be

11434.08 --> 11439.12
figured out how that

11435.84 --> 11440.8
works and yeah that happens so it's

11439.12 --> 11444.479000000001
definitely there's something there it

11440.8 --> 11447.56
has a magnificent influence on life and

11444.479 --> 11449.72
health and the quality of water and all

11447.56 --> 11452.278999999999
kinds of positive attributes that can

11449.72 --> 11455.239
come out of simatic

11452.279 --> 11459.239
architecture but what it definitely is

11455.239 --> 11462.399
not is either which cannot even be

11459.239 --> 11465.0
properly defined yeah because these

11462.399 --> 11468.119999999999
effects that come out of simatic

11465.0 --> 11471.279
architecture they don't happen naturally

11468.12 --> 11473.6
yeah simatic architecture doesn't just

11471.279 --> 11479.2
spring forth by

11473.6 --> 11482.239
itself man makes it man f figures it out

11479.2 --> 11484.479000000001
through nature through subjecting

11482.239 --> 11486.039999999999
material to sounds having simatic

11484.479 --> 11487.88
patterns and then like hey what if we

11486.04 --> 11490.52
just build that

11487.88 --> 11493.119999999999
pattern what if we incorporate that

11490.52 --> 11495.52
pattern from the simatics into the

11493.12 --> 11498.279
architecture and just figure out like

11495.52 --> 11500.76
how these effects influence things and

11498.279 --> 11502.439
how you can like oh you influence the

11500.76 --> 11504.2
sound to make the pattern yeah but what

11502.439 --> 11506.720000000001
if you take the pattern to then

11504.2 --> 11508.68
influence the sound reverse it around

11506.72 --> 11510.96
and then like oh look at all this

11508.68 --> 11515.800000000001
magical stuff that you can do with sound

11510.96 --> 11515.8
and simatic architecture and and the

11516.0 --> 11521.0
energy energies influences all this is

11519.12 --> 11522.92
amazing what people have accomplished

11521.0 --> 11525.64
with this and how far they've taken that

11522.92 --> 11526.68
in the past yeah simatic architecture

11525.64 --> 11530.08
it's

11526.68 --> 11533.800000000001
amazing it's absolutely nothing to do

11530.08 --> 11540.0
with undefinable self-contradicting

11533.8 --> 11543.278999999999
ether yeah it's man made

11540.0 --> 11545.8
technology you don't find it in nature

11543.279 --> 11551.399000000001
you find interesting things in nature I

11545.8 --> 11554.399
mean life arguably has similar effects

11551.399 --> 11558.8
like for example a really large tree

11554.399 --> 11561.72
like huge ones have arguably simatic

11558.8 --> 11564.239
like architectural qualities there's

11561.72 --> 11566.199999999999
water going through it and it it it does

11564.239 --> 11568.399
something life does something to its

11566.2 --> 11570.359
surroundings

11568.399 --> 11573.479
yeah that's and that's where the

11570.359 --> 11576.239
similarities basically end there's

11573.479 --> 11577.72
similarities with how life can influence

11576.239 --> 11581.399
its

11577.72 --> 11583.8
surroundings but yeah we can do that

11581.399 --> 11586.119999999999
even without life through simatic

11583.8 --> 11589.92
architecture and people have done that

11586.12 --> 11591.279
in the past and we are rediscovering how

11589.92 --> 11594.12
that

11591.279 --> 11598.640000000001
works but it's not being officially

11594.12 --> 11601.640000000001
accepted as much and avoided

11598.64 --> 11603.88
because if we built everything through

11601.64 --> 11606.239
simatic architecture then everything

11603.88 --> 11609.96
would be better people would not get

11606.239 --> 11611.76
sick as much and will be much better in

11609.96 --> 11613.319
their minds they would be able to focus

11611.76 --> 11615.279
better because they're not being

11613.319 --> 11618.519999999999
disrupted all the

11615.279 --> 11620.76
time through bad architecture and energy

11618.52 --> 11624.479000000001
disruption and

11620.76 --> 11628.84
depletion so the controllers people that

11624.479 --> 11631.358999999999
do government mindol control they don't

11628.84 --> 11634.56
really like simatic architecture because

11631.359 --> 11638.720000000001
it disrupts their ability to control and

11634.56 --> 11643.359
steer the common man and

11638.72 --> 11646.16
woman so yeah we'd have to overcome them

11643.359 --> 11647.68
first in order to get back to simatic
