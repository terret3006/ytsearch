all right yeah yesterday's show was

219.36 --> 223.76000000000002
pretty good uh ball busters was also

221.519 --> 227.04
pretty good

223.76 --> 231.2
uh and yeah owen benjamin

227.04 --> 231.2
was live again

232.37 --> 235.61
[Music]

237.12 --> 241.12
right i actually finished watching that

239.599 --> 243.35999999999999
red movie

241.12 --> 244.959
and i even watched red too i didn't even

243.36 --> 248.4
realize but it showed up that

244.959 --> 251.76
that one exists as well apparently

248.4 --> 254.56
uh yeah

251.76 --> 254.879
i'm moving way too quick through this

254.56 --> 259.04
but

254.879 --> 262.32
yeah it is what is yeah the movies

259.04 --> 264.8
man it yeah it was very

262.32 --> 266.71999999999997
you know in retrospect like technically

264.8 --> 268.479
they were kind of good movies but i just

266.72 --> 274.0
didn't like them too much they were too

268.479 --> 277.199
dark they were too psychopathic

274.0 --> 278.16
and i don't know it was it was supposed

277.199 --> 280.16
to be funny

278.16 --> 282.08000000000004
i guess it was sometimes kind of funny

280.16 --> 282.8
but with everything that came with it

282.08 --> 285.75899999999996
and just

282.8 --> 286.639
people being completely senselessly

285.759 --> 289.84000000000003
murdered

286.639 --> 292.0
and all that i just

289.84 --> 293.84
yeah eventually i didn't really laugh

292.0 --> 296.32
anymore

293.84 --> 298.88
so and especially the second movie was

296.32 --> 298.88
full of that

299.199 --> 305.84000000000003
yeah but he john malkovich absolutely is

302.639 --> 305.84000000000003
awesome in that movie

306.32 --> 314.4
he is like yeah

310.96 --> 318.15999999999997
it and i don't know all of them

314.4 --> 321.52
uh it's just that i just didn't like it

318.16 --> 324.8
it was too dark and like

321.52 --> 325.28
what what are they like is what is this

324.8 --> 327.6
like this

325.28 --> 329.84
is obviously like some kind of fictional

327.6 --> 330.639
representation of the cia you know and

329.84 --> 334.71999999999997
that's happened

330.639 --> 338.08
a lot of times before and of course uh

334.72 --> 338.88000000000005
again mission impossible also cia and

338.08 --> 342.08
all that

338.88 --> 344.4
it's very obvious but with this one it's

342.08 --> 344.4
it's

350.08 --> 354.08
the new pope series oh god

356.8 --> 364.479
but yeah john malkovich he is a pretty

361.199 --> 367.91900000000004
interesting character

364.479 --> 370.479
and an interesting actor like

367.919 --> 371.68
i've rarely seen him in a role where he

370.479 --> 374.71999999999997
was kind of

371.68 --> 376.8
where he was boring actually never

374.72 --> 381.84000000000003
not that i can remember maybe because

376.8 --> 381.84000000000003
then you just didn't recognize

383.12 --> 389.039
but yeah other than that the whole movie

386.16 --> 392.0
it it kind of didn't make me feel very

389.039 --> 392.0
happy afterward

392.56 --> 395.84
even though like the story i guess was

395.039 --> 399.44
kind of written

395.84 --> 402.0
well and all that and yeah

399.44 --> 402.0
i don't know

402.479 --> 409.84
but yeah

406.4 --> 409.84
other than that

411.9 --> 414.96
[Music]

417.199 --> 421.199
yeah the ball buster is live anybody

418.96 --> 423.68
seen that actually live

421.199 --> 426.08000000000004
because yeah it was kind of like

423.68 --> 427.28000000000003
rehashing the scientific method again

426.08 --> 429.68
and kind of trying to

427.28 --> 432.31899999999996
pull it deeper and i actually had a good

429.68 --> 435.36
opportunity to

432.319 --> 436.16
to ask almost like an independent

435.36 --> 438.72
journalist that

436.16 --> 440.96000000000004
was the attitude that i was taking like

438.72 --> 444.319
an interview style i tried to

440.96 --> 446.63899999999995
just ask kiwi some

444.319 --> 448.319
what i thought are generally important

446.639 --> 450.16
questions

448.319 --> 451.68
you know because i thought there are

450.16 --> 454.96000000000004
going to be people that are going to

451.68 --> 454.96
have these questions

455.199 --> 459.039
and yeah i had a good opportunity to

457.52 --> 462.31899999999996
completely put that down

459.039 --> 463.199
and he yeah he definitely responded to

462.319 --> 466.72
that

463.199 --> 470.96000000000004
and cleared some things up yeah

466.72 --> 470.96000000000004
not a hundred percent but well enough

473.36 --> 481.84000000000003
okay stallion 80 12 low by the way

478.319 --> 485.52000000000004
huh yeah where is amanda

481.84 --> 485.52
maybe she had a really late night or

485.68 --> 494.56
yeah i don't know uh

492.96 --> 496.31899999999996
but yeah that was ball busters and was

494.56 --> 499.68
kind of good oh yeah this morning also i

496.319 --> 503.36
watched a bit of uh

499.68 --> 506.479
was it of a spurs chemo show well i was

503.36 --> 510.319
in chat mostly

506.479 --> 511.44
and i even unblocked a couple of people

510.319 --> 513.76
because i don't think they're going to

511.44 --> 518.0
bother me here and yeah i'm just

513.76 --> 519.68
like i just did that

518.0 --> 521.12
we'll see i might just re-block him

519.68 --> 525.3599999999999
again and i'll be sorry

521.12 --> 527.6
that i did that uh

525.36 --> 529.839
dangerously someone's never seen that

527.6 --> 532.839
not that i can remember anyway

529.839 --> 534.399
it's all all this secret service [ __ ]

532.839 --> 539.36
it's

534.399 --> 539.36
it's not what it used to be to me uh

541.92 --> 548.0799999999999
right oh yeah

545.68 --> 551.1999999999999
yeah yesterday also what's his name

548.08 --> 554.32
again over at the arena

551.2 --> 556.72
mickey he was live

554.32 --> 560.08
like on screen live just having his own

556.72 --> 562.0
show with the panel discord active

560.08 --> 564.0
and that was kind of weird it was

562.0 --> 566.88
totally different

564.0 --> 568.399
the more generalized approach the show

566.88 --> 571.68
and all that

568.399 --> 577.839
and oh period drama okay

571.68 --> 577.8389999999999
all right sure sure

589.04 --> 591.8389999999999
maybe i'll look it up

595.839 --> 600.9590000000001
dangerous yeah yeah yeah it actually

598.88 --> 602.32
especially if it is like a historical

600.959 --> 606.56
thing

602.32 --> 606.5600000000001
i i think i probably have seen it

607.279 --> 609.68
um

610.48 --> 615.6800000000001
but i'm gonna see if i can download that

616.839 --> 619.839
one

630.839 --> 633.839
well

644.839 --> 647.839
okay

656.24 --> 661.839
okay that's weird uh

662.079 --> 665.4399999999999
yeah sorry for the delay but yeah sounds

664.8 --> 669.519
interesting

665.44 --> 672.399
and we'll see if i'm gonna be able to

669.519 --> 672.399
download that

673.36 --> 675.6800000000001
hmm

680.399 --> 685.36
or maybe i'll just find it on netflix i

682.399 --> 685.36
don't know if it's there

686.16 --> 689.8389999999999
anyway uh

691.76 --> 695.8389999999999
once upon a time in america

697.12 --> 703.839
greatest film really i think i did see

700.8 --> 703.8389999999999
that one

707.839 --> 711.519
but yeah i'm not gonna talk about movies

710.0 --> 713.76
you know i'm not gonna this is not a

711.519 --> 715.44
movie reviewing channel just because i

713.76 --> 718.959
happen to

715.44 --> 721.0400000000001
kind of watch movies on a regular basis

718.959 --> 723.04
i have a strong opinion about it or if i

721.04 --> 724.7199999999999
want to highlight it i will

723.04 --> 726.56
but yeah i'm also going to be watching

724.72 --> 729.6800000000001
some movies that in retrospect

726.56 --> 731.4399999999999
i don't think or like

729.68 --> 733.04
something that i'd want to share with

731.44 --> 736.8800000000001
the world

733.04 --> 736.88
i freaking get

741.68 --> 747.12
right anyway uh yeah okay so it's pretty

745.68 --> 748.959
much

747.12 --> 750.72
up for craps what do you guys want to

748.959 --> 753.76
talk about

750.72 --> 753.76
besides movies

754.639 --> 759.839
any anything special going on

765.76 --> 769.4399999999999
i'm noticing by the way i am getting

767.36 --> 774.0
more troll comments

769.44 --> 774.8800000000001
and yeah and my votes are just as rigged

774.0 --> 778.079
as

774.88 --> 780.8
as very absurd levels raked

778.079 --> 782.7199999999999
and so is sleeping warrior by the way

780.8 --> 784.4799999999999
like i checked out his latest video

782.72 --> 787.6800000000001
again and like the votes were like

784.48 --> 790.16
so incredibly high

787.68 --> 790.88
in downfall like i haven't seen that

790.16 --> 795.4399999999999
before

790.88 --> 797.279
that was just nutty but probably he did

795.44 --> 800.9590000000001
like step on the toes of a whole lot of

797.279 --> 803.76
baller so he is really trying to agitate

800.959 --> 803.76
draw them in

812.839 --> 818.0790000000001
ah yeah i know

814.959 --> 819.5999999999999
yeah yeah i know your troll

818.079 --> 822.16
and i'm still gonna ban you but i'll

819.6 --> 822.8000000000001
respond to it because yeah even youtube

822.16 --> 826.48
itself

822.8 --> 829.279
is really like

826.48 --> 830.16
the system is seems to be piling on

829.279 --> 833.279
hatred

830.16 --> 837.12
with me because it is even

833.279 --> 840.32
these days on a general

837.12 --> 843.36
or on a regular basis recommending

840.32 --> 845.519
videos of basically people

843.36 --> 847.279
that are seeming to do have the same

845.519 --> 847.839
setup as me just to show with them

847.279 --> 849.4399999999999
talking

847.839 --> 851.2790000000001
and blah blah blah whatever maybe a

849.44 --> 855.12
guest and they have this

851.279 --> 858.16
huge subscriber base every time like

855.12 --> 858.8
10 000 or a million or something and

858.16 --> 862.56
they're just

858.8 --> 866.24
complete tools and retards

862.56 --> 868.56
beyond belief like even fart humor

866.24 --> 869.279
[ __ ] and that has million subscribers

868.56 --> 872.16
and it's like

869.279 --> 873.4399999999999
trying to flaunt it in my face like oh

872.16 --> 876.7199999999999
yeah yeah

873.44 --> 879.839
see see it's so easy to get rich if we

876.72 --> 883.1990000000001
if you come with us if you just

879.839 --> 884.32
give up the spirit just become a

883.199 --> 887.76
complete

884.32 --> 888.32
[ __ ] [ __ ] and you get everything you

887.76 --> 891.8389999999999
ever

888.32 --> 892.72
wanted right that's a suggestion and

891.839 --> 895.7600000000001
they're doing

892.72 --> 897.6
youtube is doing this a lot

895.76 --> 899.199
like doesn't really matter what youtube

897.6 --> 901.12
video i'm watching at the end of it it's

899.199 --> 902.0
gonna recommend something that is just

901.12 --> 905.68
complete

902.0 --> 908.16
[ __ ] it's getting worse

905.68 --> 910.2399999999999
i'd love to shove like heliocentrist

908.16 --> 912.0
garbage in my face a lot of the times

910.24 --> 915.199
and like oh look at these

912.0 --> 916.24
successful heliocentric storytellers

915.199 --> 918.639
with a

916.24 --> 919.44
million subscribers and oh yeah they're

918.639 --> 922.639
oh look at

919.44 --> 924.639
their clothes are all really good

922.639 --> 925.6800000000001
looking and expensive and all the

924.639 --> 928.24
backgrounds just

925.68 --> 930.0
amazing and yeah they've done yeah i

928.24 --> 933.6800000000001
take notice of that

930.0 --> 936.56
i take notice of it all because i know

933.68 --> 937.199
how youtube works and that it is always

936.56 --> 939.8389999999999
whether you

937.199 --> 941.04
realize it or not trying to manipulate

939.839 --> 944.8800000000001
you in some

941.04 --> 947.12
way usually in a way that is not that

944.88 --> 949.279
apparent to most people if they're like

947.12 --> 950.32
looking at the same situation as a third

949.279 --> 954.16
party

950.32 --> 957.279
now it's it's tailor made for the person

954.16 --> 960.88
and their yeah their position

957.279 --> 965.68
psychologically it's very

960.88 --> 968.8
detailed and yeah that's like the ai

965.68 --> 972.56
what is it the prediction database

968.8 --> 975.68
it's basically having insight over data

972.56 --> 978.079
because of the metadata of everyone

975.68 --> 978.8
or enough people enough metadata of

978.079 --> 982.16
enough people

978.8 --> 982.56
and you get they figure out the patterns

982.16 --> 985.519
of it

982.56 --> 987.4399999999999
and they can basically then reverse

985.519 --> 990.079
engineer where it'll go

987.44 --> 991.0400000000001
and then based on that reversed

990.079 --> 993.5999999999999
engineered model

991.04 --> 995.92
prediction they start to give it nudges

993.6 --> 997.12
to make it something better in their way

995.92 --> 1000.88
whatever

997.12 --> 1005.44
yeah they're at whatever it

1000.88 --> 1005.4399999999999
their gravel sources within it all

1005.6 --> 1010.0
right it can be discouraging it can be

1008.88 --> 1013.199
encouraging it can

1010.0 --> 1015.839
be a specific advertisement or

1013.199 --> 1016.56
like connecting people because youtube

1015.839 --> 1018.8800000000001
does that

1016.56 --> 1019.92
youtube connects the people they want

1018.88 --> 1024.319
connected

1019.92 --> 1027.4389999999999
youtube is like this silent

1024.319 --> 1031.12
nannying mother type sometimes

1027.439 --> 1033.8390000000002
nobody really realizes that that just

1031.12 --> 1034.799
shoves specific type of people that the

1033.839 --> 1038.079
it

1034.799 --> 1041.839
wants to hook up like it wants that

1038.079 --> 1043.4389999999999
for what reasons because of probably the

1041.839 --> 1045.6789999999999
attention the money

1043.439 --> 1047.3600000000001
the unpredictability and the chaos which

1045.679 --> 1050.48
also brings more attention what

1047.36 --> 1053.039
it would cause it's literally trying to

1050.48 --> 1056.72
use everyone in here as a petri dish

1053.039 --> 1056.72
constantly [ __ ] around with it

1056.88 --> 1063.2
and that's how i feel sometimes but yeah

1060.72 --> 1064.4
it's not working it's just making me

1063.2 --> 1067.3600000000001
more

1064.4 --> 1068.72
angry towards it not towards everything

1067.36 --> 1072.08
else

1068.72 --> 1075.6000000000001
so or yeah not even towards it because

1072.08 --> 1077.84
it's just a a

1075.6 --> 1079.76
program that's been set by people that

1077.84 --> 1083.6
are following instructions

1079.76 --> 1087.28
made by elaborate predictions

1083.6 --> 1087.28
program just to do that

1087.44 --> 1090.64
and it is the people in control making

1089.84 --> 1095.52
the decision

1090.64 --> 1098.0
setting the directive you know

1095.52 --> 1100.08
deciding how low things will go for

1098.0 --> 1101.52
their company in order to get ahead

1100.08 --> 1103.9189999999999
those are the ones that are really

1101.52 --> 1109.84
karmically responsible for it

1103.919 --> 1109.8400000000001
so yeah the rest is mostly just tools

1118.77 --> 1123.84
[Music]

1120.84 --> 1123.84
anyway

1124.88 --> 1129.1200000000001
right any feedback besides from good

1127.12 --> 1132.7199999999998
servant by the way about the situation

1129.12 --> 1137.84
at the end of my show yesterday

1132.72 --> 1137.84
who is that guy

1140.48 --> 1143.76
because yeah i got a real bad feeling

1143.44 --> 1148.64
from

1143.76 --> 1148.64
i got like a bad vibe the way he he

1148.84 --> 1151.84
talked

1152.64 --> 1159.5200000000002
and he said that he was an agnostic

1156.08 --> 1163.039
or an a not an agnostic

1159.52 --> 1166.96
but yeah that implies things

1163.039 --> 1168.8799999999999
it does it is basic i i call gnostics at

1166.96 --> 1171.3600000000001
this point i call them atheists in

1168.88 --> 1171.3600000000001
denial

1174.799 --> 1180.8799999999999
an agnostic is like a an on the fence

1177.84 --> 1181.6789999999999
it's it's truly on the fence gnostic it

1180.88 --> 1184.7990000000002
follows an

1181.679 --> 1188.96
alternative interpretation that

1184.799 --> 1192.08
very typically excludes

1188.96 --> 1196.4
the thing see

1192.08 --> 1199.6
excludes it excludes the creator

1196.4 --> 1205.2
as a unified yeah control

1199.6 --> 1208.559
origin and that's what gnosticism is

1205.2 --> 1209.44
so yeah that you can say oh i'm not an

1208.559 --> 1211.9189999999999
atheist i

1209.44 --> 1213.8400000000001
there's there are things i know yeah but

1211.919 --> 1217.039
it it's not

1213.84 --> 1218.799
god not like that it's

1217.039 --> 1220.96
can be all kinds of interpretations

1218.799 --> 1223.44
whether it be

1220.96 --> 1224.96
super entities that you can basically

1223.44 --> 1229.2
ascend to or whatever

1224.96 --> 1230.32
or but it's it lacks the central

1229.2 --> 1233.28
controlling

1230.32 --> 1235.6
origin basically that that's technically

1233.28 --> 1239.039
what it does come down to

1235.6 --> 1248.32
and yeah and he

1239.039 --> 1250.72
it it's weird how yeah how he was

1248.32 --> 1252.0
now well martin tallberg yeah i realized

1250.72 --> 1254.4
that the the the dead

1252.0 --> 1255.12
sea scroll link right well there's lots

1254.4 --> 1257.919
of it

1255.12 --> 1260.799
and there were like it was proven

1257.919 --> 1264.96
fortune what they got

1260.799 --> 1268.08
but yeah who knows maybe maybe they did

1264.96 --> 1272.24
another typical switcheroo again

1268.08 --> 1274.72
you know it's in their favor if

1272.24 --> 1277.1200000000001
like that's the freaky thing about

1274.72 --> 1280.72
israel they're supposedly

1277.12 --> 1284.32
the israel but they are actually

1280.72 --> 1288.08
i guess well jewish

1284.32 --> 1291.2
but atheist really

1288.08 --> 1294.1589999999999
what is it secular in that sense

1291.2 --> 1296.559
even though they yeah only really

1294.159 --> 1299.5200000000002
allowed use it's weird how it works it's

1296.559 --> 1301.44
i maybe i'm getting it slightly wrong

1299.52 --> 1302.08
but it's almost like in their interest

1301.44 --> 1307.2
to

1302.08 --> 1309.84
find the real thing make forgeries of it

1307.2 --> 1310.88
and then hide it keep it completely for

1309.84 --> 1313.9189999999999
themselves

1310.88 --> 1316.48
for an unforeseen time and then put out

1313.919 --> 1320.5590000000002
the forgeries and then basically pretend

1316.48 --> 1322.48
like they forged the whole thing

1320.559 --> 1324.6399999999999
ever realized that that is something

1322.48 --> 1332.48
that they could have done as well

1324.64 --> 1335.039
some of you probably did

1332.48 --> 1335.84
gnostics believe that they have

1335.039 --> 1339.2
knowledge that

1335.84 --> 1339.1999999999998
a god exists

1339.52 --> 1344.48
is that a god with a little g on purpose

1342.4 --> 1348.64
because then

1344.48 --> 1348.64
yeah that there may be an indication of

1358.84 --> 1363.3999999999999
that

1360.35 --> 1363.3999999999999
[Music]

1365.679 --> 1374.48
right so yeah who knows

1369.44 --> 1377.679
i remember i was kind of like still

1374.48 --> 1380.64
in the system i wasn't awake

1377.679 --> 1382.5590000000002
with my parents and all that and we were

1380.64 --> 1382.96
aware of the dead sea scrolls we were

1382.559 --> 1384.48
very

1382.96 --> 1387.1200000000001
interested in all these things like the

1384.48 --> 1392.32
family family was kind of like we

1387.12 --> 1392.32
are laymen hobbyist

1392.84 --> 1398.32
anthropologists uh historians

1395.52 --> 1398.72
kind of that's we were like that you

1398.32 --> 1403.36
know

1398.72 --> 1405.2
with libraries and research and

1403.36 --> 1407.039
and everybody was kind of like muddying

1405.2 --> 1408.0
around going their own direction but we

1407.039 --> 1411.039
were all just

1408.0 --> 1412.799
naturally interested in that so

1411.039 --> 1415.6
not because we were christian but

1412.799 --> 1418.32
because we were just interested in it

1415.6 --> 1420.559
in anything like what is really in the

1418.32 --> 1421.9189999999999
ancient past and we were interested in

1420.559 --> 1423.44
giants yeah

1421.919 --> 1426.3200000000002
that was a thing it's also thing that

1423.44 --> 1428.0800000000002
kind of got us in trouble

1426.32 --> 1430.48
because there's a certain group that

1428.08 --> 1431.6789999999999
doesn't like people that like to talk

1430.48 --> 1436.64
about giants

1431.679 --> 1436.64
being real right

1437.34 --> 1442.1589999999999
[Music]

1439.36 --> 1443.039
but yeah the dead sea scrolls back then

1442.159 --> 1445.6000000000001
that came

1443.039 --> 1447.76
on the news and there was all kinds of

1445.6 --> 1448.48
talking about it and was very much in

1447.76 --> 1451.679
the interest

1448.48 --> 1455.679
and and a lot of

1451.679 --> 1457.1200000000001
already like also people that were very

1455.679 --> 1461.1200000000001
skeptical about it like

1457.12 --> 1463.6
yeah we don't really trust it

1461.12 --> 1465.12
we think that might be forgeries and all

1463.6 --> 1467.76
the hassle with

1465.12 --> 1468.9599999999998
people trying to figure out to falsify

1467.76 --> 1471.12
it and all that

1468.96 --> 1474.0
and they barely got an opportunity and

1471.12 --> 1475.52
it was it was all very dubious the whole

1474.0 --> 1478.559
setup

1475.52 --> 1480.799
but that's the thing again

1478.559 --> 1481.6
that's the devious mechanism if you

1480.799 --> 1484.84
literally

1481.6 --> 1487.6789999999999
make it fake then if it was actually

1484.84 --> 1488.8799999999999
real then you have it completely for

1487.679 --> 1492.0800000000002
yourself

1488.88 --> 1494.0800000000002
that's it's extremely devious if that

1492.08 --> 1494.3999999999999
were to be the case i don't know if it

1494.08 --> 1496.799
is

1494.4 --> 1498.48
for sure just foresee that as a

1496.799 --> 1501.9189999999999
possibility

1498.48 --> 1505.279
it's weird but

1501.919 --> 1509.279
yeah that's even like a strategy

1505.279 --> 1511.44
that i allow dark figures in my role

1509.279 --> 1514.4
playing world to utilize

1511.44 --> 1517.8400000000001
because it is a very interesting way to

1514.4 --> 1517.8400000000001
handle a complex plot

1518.0 --> 1522.799
with players that have like magic

1520.64 --> 1524.4
available and divining magic to figure

1522.799 --> 1526.48
things out magically

1524.4 --> 1528.3200000000002
you gotta make it really tough on them

1526.48 --> 1530.24
because otherwise they'll just see

1528.32 --> 1533.6
right through it after a few spells and

1530.24 --> 1533.6
all that so yeah

1534.88 --> 1538.4
it's in it yeah anyway

1539.52 --> 1543.76
maybe that happened maybe it didn't it's

1542.48 --> 1546.88
interesting

1543.76 --> 1549.36
but to me yeah you know it's

1546.88 --> 1551.919
exoterics again it is about the

1549.36 --> 1553.9189999999999
exoterics like is it real is it not real

1551.919 --> 1557.279
is it historical

1553.919 --> 1560.3200000000002
oh i'd prefer to just look at the

1557.279 --> 1562.48
essence no i do this almost with every

1560.32 --> 1564.96
story in every book

1562.48 --> 1566.48
it's like everything is like an energy

1564.96 --> 1569.44
test

1566.48 --> 1570.4
for the journey of the individual that

1569.44 --> 1573.44
is

1570.4 --> 1576.4
the main character from whatever

1573.44 --> 1579.8400000000001
perspective the story is told

1576.4 --> 1583.279
and yeah jesus has a story and it

1579.84 --> 1585.6789999999999
really stood out to me and even what

1583.279 --> 1588.0
not even like the miracles and [ __ ] you

1585.679 --> 1590.0
know the miracles to me are almost like

1588.0 --> 1594.0
a distraction

1590.0 --> 1597.52
or maybe a symbolification could beep

1594.0 --> 1600.96
you know it's yeah

1597.52 --> 1603.36
it's like that again what if

1600.96 --> 1605.279
you were confronted as a third party

1603.36 --> 1608.8799999999999
with seeing something that is just

1605.279 --> 1608.88
way beyond your understanding

1609.279 --> 1615.2
or what even if you got to got it

1612.799 --> 1617.12
explained to you for example by jesus

1615.2 --> 1619.279
like this is what it is

1617.12 --> 1621.36
and you would just realize like this is

1619.279 --> 1623.679
so

1621.36 --> 1626.08
like nobody can understand this so i'm

1623.679 --> 1628.72
going to have to kind of like downsize

1626.08 --> 1631.6
the explanation in order for people to

1628.72 --> 1635.2
be able to accept it and not go insane

1631.6 --> 1638.6399999999999
that kind of thing you know

1635.2 --> 1642.0
that yeah so what i look at

1638.64 --> 1644.48
is the essence because the

1642.0 --> 1646.399
the actual complexity of the whole thing

1644.48 --> 1647.919
of what it was written and afterward

1646.399 --> 1649.9189999999999
even what has happened with all that

1647.919 --> 1650.96
writing and all that and who got control

1649.919 --> 1654.3200000000002
and what did they do

1650.96 --> 1658.24
and it's it's

1654.32 --> 1658.6399999999999
insane it like in a physical sense it's

1658.24 --> 1662.88
just

1658.64 --> 1666.0800000000002
untenable to me

1662.88 --> 1668.5590000000002
so i but spiritually those things remain

1666.08 --> 1670.24
like even if you alter things the

1668.559 --> 1673.039
original essence

1670.24 --> 1673.679
will be in there because if it would be

1673.039 --> 1676.559
altered

1673.679 --> 1679.52
in a way that the essence would be lost

1676.559 --> 1682.48
that would be extremely recognizable

1679.52 --> 1682.96
it would be a shock it would be a shock

1682.48 --> 1686.159
from

1682.96 --> 1687.44
one version to another if it was just

1686.159 --> 1690.5590000000002
slightly different

1687.44 --> 1691.679
wherefore the essence of the whole the

1690.559 --> 1695.76
deeper meaning

1691.679 --> 1697.6000000000001
of it all would cease to be

1695.76 --> 1699.2
it would not be in there anymore and

1697.6 --> 1702.0
then the essence would be lost

1699.2 --> 1702.3990000000001
people know that because people do catch

1702.0 --> 1706.0
on

1702.399 --> 1706.0
the deeper essence as they read

1706.08 --> 1710.08
so the essence had to be retained as

1708.96 --> 1715.279
much as possible

1710.08 --> 1715.279
or the the true power would have been

1722.84 --> 1725.84
lost

1738.72 --> 1742.72
uh yeah tracy cole yeah yeah agnostics i

1742.32 --> 1745.36
know

1742.72 --> 1747.679
agnostics are not sure that's right but

1745.36 --> 1748.8799999999999
we i was referring earlier to a person

1747.679 --> 1753.279
from yesterday and we

1748.88 --> 1755.2
who said to be agnostic not a agnostic

1753.279 --> 1767.84
something very different it's actually

1755.2 --> 1767.8400000000001
quite the opposite

1777.12 --> 1782.1589999999999
george sanford agnostics and atheists

1779.679 --> 1783.279
are the only ones the mason turn away i

1782.159 --> 1786.0800000000002
don't know

1783.279 --> 1786.08
what that means

1788.32 --> 1795.84
or if that's true

1806.84 --> 1823.84
foreign i'm de-agnostic

1811.12 --> 1823.84
all right

1823.94 --> 1827.0990000000002
[Music]

1834.84 --> 1837.84
do

1839.919 --> 1851.8400000000001
yeah i know here we go again

1860.0 --> 1865.2
but i don't know why would that mean

1862.08 --> 1867.279
that they would turn them away

1865.2 --> 1869.679
you mean they wouldn't allow them as a

1867.279 --> 1869.679
member

1871.2 --> 1879.039
or like they don't like to really talk

1876.159 --> 1883.44
with them

1879.039 --> 1883.44
i'm not sure what you're implying

1890.84 --> 1893.84
exactly

1895.679 --> 1901.519
what does that mean no god no member

1904.84 --> 1907.84
okay

1914.95 --> 1918.1090000000002
[Music]

1943.44 --> 1950.799
what martin told work oh is that

1946.24 --> 1950.799
specific to the freemason

1951.679 --> 1956.5590000000002
initiation or is this

1960.84 --> 1966.0
general

1963.279 --> 1968.24
because as far as i know as far as i

1966.0 --> 1969.2
know it's very hard to tell for sure

1968.24 --> 1971.6
i've never had

1969.2 --> 1973.679
like a real personified god reveal

1971.6 --> 1977.6
themselves to me

1973.679 --> 1980.799
but i do just recognize it's like

1977.6 --> 1985.84
to me it sounds weird you know i

1980.799 --> 1989.76
i kind of d personified god like he is

1985.84 --> 1993.519
more than a person

1989.76 --> 1998.24
he is all things and we are like a

1993.519 --> 1998.24
a sub form

2000.72 --> 2007.3600000000001
that is already so so miraculous

2004.24 --> 2008.64
and strong and just like fractal inward

2007.36 --> 2011.519
and all that

2008.64 --> 2014.159
that we yeah can even mistake ourselves

2011.519 --> 2014.159
for being

2014.399 --> 2019.84
the creator because we echo him

2034.96 --> 2040.3990000000001
and within all that like christ i see

2038.159 --> 2044.159
that as

2040.399 --> 2046.559
as like the yeah

2044.159 --> 2048.7200000000003
what how would you say this spiritual

2046.559 --> 2052.0
ideology sounds kind of bad if i

2048.72 --> 2055.919
tie an ideology i don't know

2052.0 --> 2059.599
an a spiritual ideal

2055.919 --> 2063.04
it's like this is the

2059.599 --> 2066.639
the ideal way to go about this

2063.04 --> 2068.879
is the logo this is the best you could

2066.639 --> 2068.879
do

2071.52 --> 2074.8
within the whole framework of it all now

2073.44 --> 2077.679
of course

2074.8 --> 2078.8
whoever you are wherever you got

2077.679 --> 2082.399
yourself

2078.8 --> 2086.8
you can still excel from that point on

2082.399 --> 2090.879
but it yeah it is about

2086.8 --> 2096.3990000000003
how do you once you realize it

2090.879 --> 2096.399
logos how what do you do to keep it

2097.44 --> 2102.2400000000002
and yeah the fruits will come literally

2100.0 --> 2104.56
and spiritually

2102.24 --> 2106.7999999999997
socially in all kinds of ways and the

2104.56 --> 2111.599
darkness will

2106.8 --> 2111.599
turn inside out to you

2112.96 --> 2116.96
not the other way around it's not you

2114.64 --> 2119.7599999999998
gonna turn inside out no the darkness in

2116.96 --> 2122.0
the face of you

2119.76 --> 2122.0
will

2129.119 --> 2133.2000000000003
no wit to it it is not

2133.839 --> 2145.839
what is are you talking about

2150.72 --> 2156.0789999999997
yeah mark caller hey that's what i do i

2153.76 --> 2160.079
can't help it

2156.079 --> 2162.6400000000003
i'm always putting down the the bigger

2160.079 --> 2164.1600000000003
four-dimensional dream and then taking a

2162.64 --> 2173.839
swim in it

2164.16 --> 2173.839
it's what i do

2176.0 --> 2178.8
it's a heater

2184.079 --> 2187.52
like is this the very first time you

2186.0 --> 2190.32
watch my show because

2187.52 --> 2191.52
that thing there it's literally been

2190.32 --> 2194.32
standing there

2191.52 --> 2195.44
there exactly there every time i'm in

2194.32 --> 2201.839
frame

2195.44 --> 2201.839
for over four years

2205.76 --> 2208.8
sorry it's just the same as somebody

2207.839 --> 2211.52
coming oh

2208.8 --> 2216.48
what is that pendant why i have only

2211.52 --> 2216.48
talked about it like 20 times so far

2217.44 --> 2222.96
but yeah never mind i'm just expecting

2221.68 --> 2226.72
everybody to watch

2222.96 --> 2228.32
everything so far so i tend to get a bit

2226.72 --> 2231.5989999999997
impatient with

2228.32 --> 2235.04
newcomers that i've kind of known

2231.599 --> 2235.04
that haven't really watched me

2235.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
not that i've watched her to be fair

2246.88 --> 2256.88
yeah no i'm gonna be exactly what i am

2251.52 --> 2261.52
and this is what i am

2256.88 --> 2261.52
i'm just yeah impatient

2262.16 --> 2265.04
it's not an act

2267.599 --> 2271.839
right tracy cole i know it's your first

2269.599 --> 2272.88
time here because i don't recognize your

2271.839 --> 2276.16

and the picture with twit i know has

2276.16 --> 2281.92
been around for years

2278.32 --> 2285.599
so that's why i

2281.92 --> 2289.44
acted like that but hey anything else

2285.599 --> 2291.52
you want to know about the crossbow

2289.44 --> 2292.96
which is in the crossbow even though

2291.52 --> 2299.28
everybody seems to be calling it a

2292.96 --> 2302.96
crossbow every time

2299.28 --> 2302.96
oh you did good servant okay

2303.359 --> 2313.839
you mean tracy cole or wit twitter

2326.88 --> 2330.079
everybody's welcome here

2331.2 --> 2334.96

that's like

2334.96 --> 2341.599
oh i'm happy with everyone yay

2339.28 --> 2343.92
you know you know if you're interested

2341.599 --> 2347.599
it's fine but

2343.92 --> 2347.599
just make sure yeah

2349.28 --> 2356.5600000000004
try to stay on par

2352.32 --> 2356.56
that's fine hey northern ireland

2356.96 --> 2361.359
all right how's the weather up there

2362.0 --> 2369.839
is it as hot as it is here or is it a

2364.0 --> 2369.839
bit more cloudy

2378.72 --> 2383.839
all right cool

2392.32 --> 2396.1600000000003
right yeah if you don't know too much

2393.839 --> 2399.04
about flutter that's fine

2396.16 --> 2400.56
if you look since you are new here and

2399.04 --> 2403.119
you've already been uh

2400.56 --> 2403.119
you call that

2404.16 --> 2406.96
identified

2408.079 --> 2412.48
checked out yeah it's fine if you want

2410.48 --> 2414.16
to ask some basic questions

2412.48 --> 2417.92
that you think might clear up a lot of

2414.16 --> 2420.56
things then yeah you're welcome to ask

2417.92 --> 2422.96
because i know who you are and where

2420.56 --> 2422.96
you're at

2423.28 --> 2426.88
right you've that's the word because

2425.2 --> 2430.48
you've been vetted

2426.88 --> 2439.839
that's the word right to be confirmed by

2430.48 --> 2439.839
somebody you've confirmed

2451.839 --> 2455.44
why it is important

2457.52 --> 2462.96
well because

2460.88 --> 2464.96
it is important to be able to

2462.96 --> 2468.16
distinguish

2464.96 --> 2472.7200000000003
between truthful

2468.16 --> 2475.1189999999997
fact and deceptional

2472.72 --> 2475.1189999999997
lies

2476.0 --> 2480.16
because if you don't and you can't

2479.119 --> 2483.76
distinguish it

2480.16 --> 2485.68
then you may be led on through the false

2483.76 --> 2487.599
belief onto a path

2485.68 --> 2489.04
basically getting seduced getting drawn

2487.599 --> 2493.28
into something

2489.04 --> 2494.88
that is basically just to scam you

2493.28 --> 2497.599
it could be psychologically could be

2494.88 --> 2500.2400000000002
financially could be all kinds of things

2497.599 --> 2501.6800000000003
you know and what they typically do is

2500.24 --> 2505.52
dramatize or

2501.68 --> 2508.16
try to make you feel extreme in some way

2505.52 --> 2508.88
and then draw something out of you a

2508.16 --> 2511.359
specific

2508.88 --> 2514.319
response that's they want and it's

2511.359 --> 2517.92
usually not too great for you

2514.319 --> 2519.68
in the real world so yeah that's why

2517.92 --> 2525.52
it's important

2519.68 --> 2525.52
to understand what is really going on

2526.56 --> 2530.88
and it's not like you constantly have to

2528.56 --> 2532.7999999999997
in visualize how you are standing

2530.88 --> 2534.7200000000003
on a flat earth all day long you know

2532.8 --> 2535.76
it's not about keeping your attention to

2534.72 --> 2539.9199999999996
oh wait the earth is

2535.76 --> 2543.76
oh the earth is flat no it's about

2539.92 --> 2544.7200000000003
figuring out how it was how it came to

2543.76 --> 2547.92
be

2544.72 --> 2549.5989999999997
how we came to the situation

2547.92 --> 2551.2000000000003
where everybody's being told the earth

2549.599 --> 2554.48
is a ball

2551.2 --> 2558.0
and then what have we done since

2554.48 --> 2559.359
roughly 2015 when it seemed to have been

2558.0 --> 2562.88
opened up

2559.359 --> 2564.88
through youtube what have we done in

2562.88 --> 2567.44
response

2564.88 --> 2568.7200000000003
and then what have we figured out about

2567.44 --> 2571.599
the evidences

2568.72 --> 2574.3999999999996
that were presented to us to prove the

2571.599 --> 2574.4
earth was a ball

2575.119 --> 2578.6400000000003
and yeah it's a pretty big history by

2576.88 --> 2582.4
now but

2578.64 --> 2584.64
yeah once you really understand that

2582.4 --> 2586.64
what has happened where it came from

2584.64 --> 2590.8799999999997
what's really going on

2586.64 --> 2594.64
then you'll see through

2590.88 --> 2596.7200000000003
the overly exciting maybe terrifying

2594.64 --> 2599.359
[ __ ] stories that are

2596.72 --> 2601.2799999999997
meant to keep you locked in your own

2599.359 --> 2602.96
mind paranoid about something that can

2601.28 --> 2606.7200000000003
never happen

2602.96 --> 2608.319
that's one example a more generalized

2606.72 --> 2609.7599999999998
response because if you get locked up in

2608.319 --> 2611.7599999999998
your head paranoid about something that

2609.76 --> 2617.28
cannot happen

2611.76 --> 2620.6400000000003
you don't use that time to pay attention

2617.28 --> 2621.599
to think about to not worry about

2620.64 --> 2624.56
nonsense

2621.599 --> 2625.52
but to actually realize wait i am here i

2624.56 --> 2629.68
need to build

2625.52 --> 2635.839
things i need to get my life together

2629.68 --> 2635.839
for example in some way you know yeah

2636.8 --> 2643.8390000000004
right and the flat earth is

2640.8 --> 2647.28
yeah it's a tough one but

2643.839 --> 2648.319
yeah even bypass just overlooking flat

2647.28 --> 2651.52
earth for a moment

2648.319 --> 2654.48
even now in the world they've

2651.52 --> 2656.48
even upped the level with the corona

2654.48 --> 2660.839
situation

2656.48 --> 2664.2400000000002
and that's just so blatant that even the

2660.839 --> 2666.7999999999997
the the deepest slumbering of

2664.24 --> 2669.68
general public is catching on to that

2666.8 --> 2669.6800000000003
that is a lie

2670.8 --> 2675.28
so it's almost like we got another

2672.56 --> 2677.2799999999997
stepping stone to get to the realization

2675.28 --> 2680.5600000000004
of flat earth because that one is even

2677.28 --> 2680.5600000000004
more blatantly obvious

2680.72 --> 2686.64
and also on a giant scale

2684.0 --> 2689.599
to really show that yes you can make

2686.64 --> 2692.72
such a big lie

2689.599 --> 2694.2400000000002
and a lot of people will fall in line

2692.72 --> 2696.7999999999997
because they don't understand what's

2694.24 --> 2696.7999999999997
going on

2699.2 --> 2703.4399999999996
and they will be dragged around by the

2701.04 --> 2704.0
suggestions and the delusions that come

2703.44 --> 2706.319
with these

2704.0 --> 2706.319
lies

2712.64 --> 2718.96
right anyway that's the reason why

2716.96 --> 2721.28
we're not getting into technicals just

2718.96 --> 2721.28
yet

2722.16 --> 2726.8799999999997
but anyway i hope you uh appreciate my

2724.48 --> 2726.88
answer

2731.119 --> 2747.839
and take it to heart

2758.839 --> 2764.88
hmm

2760.96 --> 2766.8
well yeah good servant yeah that's

2764.88 --> 2768.0
it's yeah it's an old-fashioned argument

2766.8 --> 2770.96
it's important to know how

2768.0 --> 2773.2
significant we are we are not a spec

2770.96 --> 2775.2400000000002
flying around

2773.2 --> 2777.359
we're not like one in a hundred

2775.24 --> 2780.319
quadrillion

2777.359 --> 2781.839
no we're one in six billion or whatever

2780.319 --> 2786.319
how many

2781.839 --> 2790.16
we're supposed to have and

2786.319 --> 2792.72
that's still you know to me that's still

2790.16 --> 2793.68
i don't see the difference that much i

2792.72 --> 2795.9199999999996
already think i

2793.68 --> 2798.0789999999997
i feel already kind of insignificant in

2795.92 --> 2801.359
between six billion

2798.079 --> 2804.0
so to me the amounts is not important

2801.359 --> 2808.16
because that scale is beyond

2804.0 --> 2812.319
human we're not supposed to

2808.16 --> 2815.04
attain that you know

2812.319 --> 2816.96
because that is what where my more

2815.04 --> 2819.04
direct connection there

2816.96 --> 2820.96
is just the realization that the

2819.04 --> 2821.359
personal connection with god which is

2820.96 --> 2824.13
there

2821.359 --> 2826.7999999999997
from before birth

2824.13 --> 2828.56
[Music]

2826.8 --> 2830.079
and then it doesn't matter if there are

2828.56 --> 2834.0
six billion people

2830.079 --> 2838.7200000000003
or if there are 400 quadrillion

2834.0 --> 2840.319
people because it doesn't matter

2838.72 --> 2843.2
to the significance because you have a

2840.319 --> 2845.2799999999997
personal relation

2843.2 --> 2847.9199999999996
and does it matter how many others are

2845.28 --> 2847.92
out there then

2851.2 --> 2859.839
but anyway that's yeah that's how i

2853.28 --> 2859.8390000000004
eventually responded to that

2868.079 --> 2872.079
all right but technically a good surf

2870.88 --> 2875.92
and it is a good

2872.079 --> 2876.88
response it is like it was the first

2875.92 --> 2881.04
response to

2876.88 --> 2884.96
a lot of heliocentrist philosophizing

2881.04 --> 2888.16
like people that kind of used that

2884.96 --> 2892.7200000000003
consent the the heliocentric physics

2888.16 --> 2895.359
ideas to counter

2892.72 --> 2897.4399999999996
religious debate say that it's all

2895.359 --> 2897.839
[ __ ] and all this idea that we're

2897.44 --> 2900.88
all

2897.839 --> 2904.24
unique and no we're one in a hundred cr

2900.88 --> 2907.44
100 400 quadrillion or whatever

2904.24 --> 2909.52
or more so that is all [ __ ] that see

2907.44 --> 2911.599
that was their original kind of speaking

2909.52 --> 2912.16
point philosophizing by the pseudo

2911.599 --> 2914.4
intellect

2912.16 --> 2916.0
intellects that were all forwarded these

2914.4 --> 2918.079
great thinkers

2916.0 --> 2919.359
throughout from the 70s throughout the

2918.079 --> 2921.2000000000003
late 90s

2919.359 --> 2922.96
and even today but now it's everything

2921.2 --> 2924.72
it's just blabber

2922.96 --> 2926.96
it's not they're not really even trying

2924.72 --> 2929.04
that much it's not there's not even any

2926.96 --> 2929.599
genuineness to it anymore it's just all

2929.04 --> 2932.96
system

2929.599 --> 2935.6800000000003
systematic now

2932.96 --> 2935.68
in this time

2936.24 --> 2939.5989999999997
and that was a good response to it like

2938.319 --> 2942.5589999999997
yeah you know what

2939.599 --> 2945.599
you're basing your philosophy of that

2942.559 --> 2948.88
we're all so insignificant on

2945.599 --> 2949.52
a false physical reality and that

2948.88 --> 2952.559
certainly

2949.52 --> 2955.2
really broke that that perspective that

2952.559 --> 2956.4
hopelessness that putting people adrift

2955.2 --> 2959.2799999999997
because it's all

2956.4 --> 2959.599
doesn't matter anymore you know because

2959.28 --> 2963.3590000000004
that

2959.599 --> 2966.559
is what heliocentrism also does it's

2963.359 --> 2968.16
hardcore atheists and it takes away

2966.559 --> 2969.76
the significance and the light and the

2968.16 --> 2972.319
hope whether you

2969.76 --> 2974.7200000000003
want to realize that about it or not it

2972.319 --> 2977.44
does that effectively

2974.72 --> 2979.04
and the more you have of it through god

2977.44 --> 2979.68
and you don't have to be an intellect

2979.04 --> 2981.2
then

2979.68 --> 2982.7999999999997
and if you don't and you get caught

2981.2 --> 2984.7999999999997
there yeah what's everybody going to do

2982.8 --> 2988.319
they're going to deceivingly try to rip

2984.8 --> 2991.3590000000004
that light away that's what they do

2988.319 --> 2993.44
and to an outsider if you realize that

2991.359 --> 2994.88
then it does kind of look demonic even

2993.44 --> 2996.839
back then

2994.88 --> 2998.1600000000003
the way they would respond they would be

2996.839 --> 3001.04
outraged by

2998.16 --> 3003.7599999999998
this stupid religious person you know

3001.04 --> 3003.7599999999998
remember that

3005.28 --> 3008.88
well when i saw that i was like

3006.88 --> 3010.8
sympathizing with the issues like yeah

3008.88 --> 3012.079
it is outrageous because those people

3010.8 --> 3014.4
are stupid

3012.079 --> 3016.88
it is outrage that's my that was my

3014.4 --> 3019.76
response back then

3016.88 --> 3020.48
and yeah a lot of christians sorry to

3019.76 --> 3022.3190000000004
say

3020.48 --> 3025.599
self-professed christians that who read

3022.319 --> 3029.68
the bible every day are freaking stupid

3025.599 --> 3032.0
doesn't mean that wrong about christ

3029.68 --> 3033.68
doesn't mean that they're not absolutely

3032.0 --> 3034.4
dedicating themselves to trying to do

3033.68 --> 3037.44
their best

3034.4 --> 3039.76
it just means they're very

3037.44 --> 3042.48
inflexible many ways and got caught up

3039.76 --> 3045.76
in the complexities

3042.48 --> 3050.559
of the outside world because yeah

3045.76 --> 3052.7200000000003
there is no way out of the trials

3050.559 --> 3054.2400000000002
there is no way out of the trials and if

3052.72 --> 3056.16
you think you're gonna

3054.24 --> 3058.0
build your life perfectly through the

3056.16 --> 3059.52
bible knowledge like that

3058.0 --> 3062.16
the trials are gonna come from the

3059.52 --> 3065.2
inside out anyway

3062.16 --> 3068.3999999999996
and that's something that i think

3065.2 --> 3072.5589999999997
a lot of general christians just

3068.4 --> 3072.559
don't realize and they don't want to

3072.88 --> 3078.1600000000003
i think that's a big problem they don't

3075.44 --> 3083.44
want to face the reality

3078.16 --> 3086.0789999999997
of it all

3083.44 --> 3087.76
and that's by the way that's humans for

3086.079 --> 3088.8
you that's humans all humans whether

3087.76 --> 3090.4
they're

3088.8 --> 3093.44
christians it's like fundamentally

3090.4 --> 3093.44
christian raised

3094.24 --> 3097.2799999999997
yeah all the different types or whether

3096.8 --> 3101.44
they're

3097.28 --> 3104.8
bottom line atheists just the city folk

3101.44 --> 3106.4
they're basically the same in that way

3104.8 --> 3108.2400000000002
because they're afraid to confront

3106.4 --> 3109.839
themselves with real things too and

3108.24 --> 3113.52
that's why they keep on dwelling

3109.839 --> 3124.72
around and muddying around in their way

3113.52 --> 3126.88
see it's all humans

3124.72 --> 3128.64
i don't i hope you you got my point

3126.88 --> 3131.52
there

3128.64 --> 3133.52
god servant i know you're always very

3131.52 --> 3135.119
you have to the bible very close to your

3133.52 --> 3138.48
heart so like uh

3135.119 --> 3141.6800000000003
but it yeah

3138.48 --> 3145.119
you know i think

3141.68 --> 3148.0789999999997
the bible is it's like a spiritual

3145.119 --> 3148.4
guideline and if it if you catch it if

3148.079 --> 3151.92
you

3148.4 --> 3152.96
if you get it basically then you get it

3151.92 --> 3155.28
but it's

3152.96 --> 3157.359
it's not the own it should not be the

3155.28 --> 3161.52
only thing it should be

3157.359 --> 3161.52
in one hand the bible in the other

3161.92 --> 3169.44
your your personal

3165.52 --> 3171.839
priesthood as an individual

3169.44 --> 3173.52
but maybe maybe that's just me as an

3171.839 --> 3176.5589999999997
eclectic

3173.52 --> 3176.559
that i think like that

3177.28 --> 3180.6400000000003
it's like your own personal development

3179.599 --> 3183.92
your own

3180.64 --> 3187.92
always realize that no matter who bar

3183.92 --> 3191.52
maybe jesus himself they're all humans

3187.92 --> 3194.64
and it's just known all humans always

3191.52 --> 3197.68
they all have that that trial

3194.64 --> 3198.72
and the trial is often truth and

3197.68 --> 3202.5589999999997
mistakes

3198.72 --> 3204.64
so it's natural that there is nothing

3202.559 --> 3208.0
perfect that can be presented to you

3204.64 --> 3212.24
that's how i see it and if you think

3208.0 --> 3215.599
it is that is a mistake right there

3212.24 --> 3219.04
and that's why i've abandoned

3215.599 --> 3221.44
the most part the exoteric approach

3219.04 --> 3224.5589999999997
to these types of writings and purely go

3221.44 --> 3227.52
by the esoterics and by the essence the

3224.559 --> 3227.92
what is really what is that what does it

3227.52 --> 3231.7599999999998
mean

3227.92 --> 3231.76
how deep does the meaning reach

3231.839 --> 3236.0
because that is worth more it's more

3233.92 --> 3239.28
clear to me

3236.0 --> 3244.4
than any kind of to the word

3239.28 --> 3244.4
exact interpretation in a literal

3248.839 --> 3251.839
fashion

3254.48 --> 3258.319
what are you saying there here we go

3262.839 --> 3265.839
again

3276.839 --> 3279.839
okay

3287.68 --> 3293.839
oh you're talking about all right

3294.24 --> 3297.04
peter stone

3297.359 --> 3307.839
where all right

3332.079 --> 3336.1600000000003
yeah peter stone the moon is a mirage or

3335.28 --> 3339.8390000000004
not

3336.16 --> 3343.2799999999997
mirage in the optics

3339.839 --> 3344.16
the terrestrial optics sense no but it

3343.28 --> 3347.76
is a pure

3344.16 --> 3352.16
light based phenomena a light only

3347.76 --> 3352.1600000000003
phenomena that's what it is

3352.96 --> 3357.76
thank you for the dollar super jet

3354.16 --> 3363.839
donation good servant much appreciated

3357.76 --> 3363.8390000000004
thank you for the nickel

3366.64 --> 3373.359
yeah and by the way all celestial

3369.76 --> 3376.559
phenomena are light only phenomena

3373.359 --> 3379.5989999999997
oh by the way that was interesting

3376.559 --> 3382.6400000000003
on listening to the arena

3379.599 --> 3382.96
yesterday i think it was the arena and a

3382.64 --> 3387.2799999999997
bit

3382.96 --> 3390.079
back and forth about

3387.28 --> 3390.7200000000003
uh about the comet it's funny because

3390.079 --> 3392.88
remember

3390.72 --> 3394.16
what is it now three four days ago i

3392.88 --> 3396.1600000000003
asked about the comet

3394.16 --> 3398.0789999999997
about the situation of the comet does it

3396.16 --> 3401.359
rotate with the star

3398.079 --> 3405.28
the globe star the

3401.359 --> 3408.0789999999997
the celestial and well these guys

3405.28 --> 3408.3190000000004
actually did the research they looked it

3408.079 --> 3410.4
up

3408.319 --> 3411.68
and they they were telling like yeah

3410.4 --> 3415.28
this is so

3411.68 --> 3418.24
weird like why is it like it's stuck

3415.28 --> 3420.2400000000002
to the star backdrop isn't it supposed

3418.24 --> 3423.04
to be in our solar system then it would

3420.24 --> 3426.319
have its separate orbit like the planets

3423.04 --> 3429.92
but apparently they figured out that

3426.319 --> 3433.2
this comet for whatever reason is

3429.92 --> 3434.799
indeed set on the globe of the heavens

3433.2 --> 3436.8799999999997
as if it is

3434.799 --> 3438.799
uh yeah a star background not a separate

3436.88 --> 3441.839
or orbit

3438.799 --> 3442.48
not a separate rotation cycle like the

3441.839 --> 3446.16
planets

3442.48 --> 3447.92
and the sun and the moon so that was

3446.16 --> 3450.8799999999997
interesting that that was brought up

3447.92 --> 3450.88
i kind of called it

3454.96 --> 3459.52
and yeah it's it's cool that people are

3457.92 --> 3463.52
now thinking about that

3459.52 --> 3463.52
yeah it is it is fixed

3465.2 --> 3472.8799999999997
it's fixed to the star backdrop

3469.04 --> 3476.16
of the heavens so it rotates this

3472.88 --> 3478.079
15 degrees per hour just like all the

3476.16 --> 3489.839
stars

3478.079 --> 3489.8390000000004
that's exactly what it does

3501.599 --> 3506.0
oh thanks peter stone iron is metal

3514.839 --> 3519.68
what

3516.48 --> 3519.68
what are you talking about

3520.0 --> 3524.4
the eiffel tower is made from steel

3522.88 --> 3528.839
steel is not iron

3524.4 --> 3531.839
steel is iron and carbon and it's very

3528.839 --> 3531.839
specific

3542.839 --> 3545.839
division

3546.559 --> 3553.28
yeah i know i worked with it

3550.0 --> 3556.96
i i know metallurgy i'm a goldsmith

3553.28 --> 3560.88
i've even literally

3556.96 --> 3564.0
forged swords literally

3560.88 --> 3566.2400000000002
with an anvil and a hammer i know

3564.0 --> 3566.24
this

3566.79 --> 3572.16
[Music]

3568.64 --> 3575.52
oh right so a metal is not steel you say

3572.16 --> 3578.799
really are you actually

3575.52 --> 3583.04
trying to say that you think the

3578.799 --> 3586.96
eiffel tower is made of cast iron

3583.04 --> 3590.799
pick iron that's

3586.96 --> 3594.48
absurd that's totally absurd if the

3590.799 --> 3596.88
eiffel tower was made of cast iron

3594.48 --> 3599.2
it would be so freaking heavy it would

3596.88 --> 3604.799
literally break under its own weight

3599.2 --> 3607.4399999999996
besides cast iron is not very flexible

3604.799 --> 3608.96
it's very heavy it's not very flexible

3607.44 --> 3610.559
it can be very hard you know you could

3608.96 --> 3612.64
use it like a wall or whatever

3610.559 --> 3614.559
but steel has totally different

3612.64 --> 3618.0789999999997
properties from iron

3614.559 --> 3620.3190000000004
it's much lighter and it's extremely

3618.079 --> 3623.119
flexible like the unique properties of

3620.319 --> 3625.92
steel compared to most metals

3623.119 --> 3626.839
is that they have a great tensile you

3625.92 --> 3630.4
can

3626.839 --> 3632.799
actually stretch it apart and it'll

3630.4 --> 3632.799
vibrate

3634.0 --> 3636.72
warp back

3637.2 --> 3640.64
that's why they make springs of it too

3638.96 --> 3644.319
and all that

3640.64 --> 3646.319
right that's steel

3644.319 --> 3647.52
they could have never even made the

3646.319 --> 3649.2
eiffel tower

3647.52 --> 3651.839
if they didn't use steel this is

3649.2 --> 3651.839
ridiculous

3653.359 --> 3657.839
oh are we backtracking now are we oh

3680.079 --> 3686.7200000000003
right can you imagine iron beams

3683.599 --> 3689.3590000000004
and cast iron beams and plates

3686.72 --> 3689.359
that's just

3690.88 --> 3702.2400000000002
it's intentional

3699.44 --> 3704.88
like they couldn't really even make

3702.24 --> 3708.72
high-rise buildings with

3704.88 --> 3708.7200000000003
with iron

3708.799 --> 3713.839
they could they only started doing it

3711.359 --> 3713.839
with steel

3714.24 --> 3718.24
george sanford google irwin google is my

3717.68 --> 3721.2799999999997
friend

3718.24 --> 3722.8799999999997
uh i didn't google anything did you hear

3721.28 --> 3726.559
me type in anything no i

3722.88 --> 3730.1600000000003
know this i know it

3726.559 --> 3730.1600000000003
don't have to look up anything

3738.839 --> 3743.2799999999997
really

3740.559 --> 3744.0
let's make stuff made of cost iron okay

3743.28 --> 3755.8390000000004
now

3744.0 --> 3755.839
i got to see this

3758.0 --> 3771.539
okay i'm gonna look at this all right

3768.42 --> 3771.539
[Music]

3780.839 --> 3783.839
1887

3794.839 --> 3797.839
foreign

3804.48 --> 3808.839
okay it's not giving any hints so far

3806.319 --> 3811.839
i'm at page

3808.839 --> 3811.839
four

3836.839 --> 3853.839
ah

3839.119 --> 3853.839
ah construction there you go finally

3863.119 --> 3867.839
okay they call it iron work

3869.28 --> 3873.119
so it might simply not be cast iron it

3872.48 --> 3875.359
might be

3873.119 --> 3880.079
forged iron then it is going to be a lot

3875.359 --> 3883.839
more stretchy and all that

3880.079 --> 3895.8390000000004
let's see i'm not getting any specifics

3883.839 --> 3895.839
so far besides it being called iron work

3915.68 --> 3923.839
metal work it doesn't say it just

3918.799 --> 3923.839
it's not being very explicit about it

3932.16 --> 3939.52
yeah no it doesn't say

3937.039 --> 3941.28
this is it calls it ironworks but it

3939.52 --> 3945.68
doesn't say exactly what

3941.28 --> 3945.6800000000003
type of material they use and

3948.839 --> 3951.839
whatever

3969.68 --> 3979.839
yeah george sanford you're saying that

3973.359 --> 3979.839
tour eiffel papyrus

4004.839 --> 4007.839
hmm

4010.64 --> 4021.839
okay that's interesting

4025.119 --> 4031.599
oh okay okay

4028.559 --> 4033.6800000000003
right so it was like a relic

4031.599 --> 4036.6400000000003
so they already did have they actually

4033.68 --> 4040.48
address it they had

4036.64 --> 4043.2
steel but he because of like yeah the

4040.48 --> 4044.88
industrial application of it because it

4043.2 --> 4047.1189999999997
was very trusted

4044.88 --> 4048.0
like they have been using iron in

4047.119 --> 4050.799
construction for

4048.0 --> 4051.28
so long they knew exactly what to expect

4050.799 --> 4054.4
from it

4051.28 --> 4056.799
when steel was relatively new for big

4054.4 --> 4059.92
construction so he just went with iron

4056.799 --> 4059.92
okay okay

4060.16 --> 4066.0789999999997
right then i was wrong

4063.68 --> 4066.0789999999997
i guess

4069.359 --> 4075.7599999999998
but yeah it hey

4073.44 --> 4076.7200000000003
it wasn't strange of me to basically

4075.76 --> 4079.119
expect that

4076.72 --> 4080.319
because it is the aegis deal but yeah

4079.119 --> 4091.839
apparently

4080.319 --> 4091.839
it is an exception

4104.799 --> 4110.08
right yeah peter stone

4108.56 --> 4113.279
that's right that's what i would

4110.08 --> 4115.359
normally expect but as this

4113.279 --> 4116.64
well this reference point here already

4115.359 --> 4118.96
explained

4116.64 --> 4121.04
it's in a period where they really knew

4118.96 --> 4123.6
already how to industrially

4121.04 --> 4127.6
industrially purify iron so it wasn't

4123.6 --> 4133.839
just the old-fashioned casting iron

4127.6 --> 4133.839
reflected the overall 18th century

4134.239 --> 4139.678999999999
it was very refined iron

4137.44 --> 4147.759
right in the transitional period where

4139.679 --> 4152.719
they were starting to use steel

4147.759 --> 4152.719
so all right yeah

4159.04 --> 4161.839
that's weird

4162.64 --> 4166.319
it's weird that i'd remember it like

4164.319 --> 4168.56
this i thought it was made of steel but

4166.319 --> 4170.319
apparently

4168.56 --> 4172.400000000001
i think i probably made that

4170.319 --> 4175.120000000001
misassumption

4172.4 --> 4175.599999999999
before and then it turned out to be iron

4175.12 --> 4179.2789999999995
and i

4175.6 --> 4182.64
thought like uh why that missed stupid

4179.279 --> 4184.080000000001
they had steel so

4182.64 --> 4186.159000000001
yeah i don't know if i'm gonna forget

4184.08 --> 4187.679
about this is a great likelihood that in

4186.159 --> 4188.08
10 years somebody's going to ask me

4187.679 --> 4189.92
again

4188.08 --> 4192.3189999999995
and i might even make the same mistake

4189.92 --> 4195.4400000000005
and think it's steel again

4192.319 --> 4199.120000000001
so because i think i probably

4195.44 --> 4199.839999999999
made that mistake before because of just

4199.12 --> 4203.28
the time

4199.84 --> 4217.84
you know i am going by by the time

4203.28 --> 4217.84
what is around in that time

4227.44 --> 4245.839999999999
all right mark collard

4231.36 --> 4245.839999999999
yeah hey troll [ __ ] off

4246.56 --> 4251.52
just please delete that guy somebody

4249.76 --> 4254.4800000000005
starts out saying that just

4251.52 --> 4256.719
it they hide them nobody starts out like

4254.48 --> 4256.718999999999
that

4256.84 --> 4259.84
nobody

4275.6 --> 4280.88
what joel no i looked through the

4279.199 --> 4282.639999999999
wikipedia and it's not

4280.88 --> 4284.56
some sort of steel they call it

4282.64 --> 4287.84
ironworks

4284.56 --> 4291.84
and that's about all it says i literally

4287.84 --> 4291.84
went through just

4291.92 --> 4299.12
many many pages

4295.6 --> 4300.64
of the the the wikipedia on the eiffel

4299.12 --> 4305.44
tower and there is just

4300.64 --> 4305.4400000000005
no oh jesus

4305.679 --> 4309.76
apparently i wasn't there yet yeah right

4307.52 --> 4313.4400000000005
oh finally after

4309.76 --> 4316.159000000001
20 pages material puddled iron

4313.44 --> 4316.159
wrought iron

4317.12 --> 4329.84
oh it's extremely heavy

4330.8 --> 4334.88
well that's bizarre it even has thermal

4333.76 --> 4337.92
expansion

4334.88 --> 4338.400000000001
you have to account for that from the

4337.92 --> 4343.84
sun

4338.4 --> 4343.839999999999
on one side 18 centimeters huh

4358.32 --> 4370.32
anyway enough about that thing

4361.36 --> 4372.96
why was it even brought up

4370.32 --> 4375.12
all right yeah more colored yeah that is

4372.96 --> 4376.88
what i said i said it's definitely not

4375.12 --> 4379.5199999999995
going to be made of cast iron

4376.88 --> 4384.96
and i think that peter stone did kind of

4379.52 --> 4386.56
say that i don't know

4384.96 --> 4399.84
like the back and forth there got kind

4386.56 --> 4399.84
of messy

4416.239 --> 4422.159
hmm okay joelle that's funny

4420.159 --> 4423.679
i didn't even know that thank you that's

4422.159 --> 4426.96
informative

4423.679 --> 4429.92
so they consider it to be low

4426.96 --> 4429.92
carbon steel

4431.12 --> 4437.5199999999995
because it it does describe getting

4434.8 --> 4439.6
like the process getting the carbon

4437.52 --> 4440.400000000001
which is still in there apparently to

4439.6 --> 4443.76
get it out

4440.4 --> 4444.879999999999
of there using the puddling basically

4443.76 --> 4448.320000000001
probably heat it up

4444.88 --> 4448.719
so that the the carbonated parts would

4448.32 --> 4452.159
go

4448.719 --> 4454.8
down and the pure iron would float

4452.159 --> 4456.08
and then they sift it off somehow

4454.8 --> 4458.0
something like that

4456.08 --> 4460.719
i don't know the exact details of the

4458.0 --> 4469.84
process i've never done that

4460.719 --> 4469.84
i've never caused iron before

4480.0 --> 4485.92
all right iron iron iron

4483.12 --> 4485.92
lots of iron

4487.52 --> 4497.84
oh wow look at that

4490.719 --> 4497.84
let me clear it up here

4504.64 --> 4511.84
pretty nice

4518.32 --> 4525.84
ah thank you

4527.04 --> 4532.96
yeah if anybody else by the way

4530.64 --> 4534.159000000001
wants to support me you can always do

4532.96 --> 4538.64
that the paypal

4534.159 --> 4542.5599999999995
link is in the description box below

4538.64 --> 4542.56
any help would be great

4546.159 --> 4553.839999999999
so yeah you don't have to talk about it

4548.08 --> 4553.84
you can just do it

4559.28 --> 4563.759999999999
or do it and then talk about it after

4561.199 --> 4566.639999999999
you've done it that's fine

4563.76 --> 4570.159000000001
anyway i'm probably gonna run out my

4566.64 --> 4570.159000000001
show not too long from now

4573.92 --> 4581.84
oh all right

4576.96 --> 4581.84
good for you here we go again

4616.64 --> 4618.88
what

4621.52 --> 4637.84
you're nearly as jealous of me as

4624.64 --> 4637.84
of wakey what what does that mean

4644.08 --> 4650.08
right yeah more colored i know it is

4646.56 --> 4653.360000000001
really the

4650.08 --> 4656.719
the specific property properties

4653.36 --> 4657.679
that set in with like over that carbon

4656.719 --> 4660.88
level

4657.679 --> 4663.36
the specific properties that

4660.88 --> 4664.0
yeah allow it to be designated as steel

4663.36 --> 4666.799999999999
it has to have

4664.0 --> 4668.32
the steel properties and then it becomes

4666.8 --> 4671.52
steel and that is at

4668.32 --> 4674.719
over the uh 0.6

4671.52 --> 4676.0
carbon that's right so it is really

4674.719 --> 4679.12
about the properties not

4676.0 --> 4680.96
even about the number and that

4679.12 --> 4684.4
yeah that property arrives above that

4680.96 --> 4693.84
number just happens to be on average

4684.4 --> 4693.839999999999
in ideal solution of metals

4702.56 --> 4707.84
ews oh right that's what [ __ ]

4722.159 --> 4726.32
right uh i'm probably gonna round out

4724.96 --> 4729.12
now

4726.32 --> 4730.32
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4729.12 --> 4734.0
like this show

4730.32 --> 4735.92
it was a bit weird this is a lot of talk

4734.0 --> 4737.36
about the eiffel tower and what type of

4735.92 --> 4741.12
metal it is and

4737.36 --> 4745.12
i guess metal construction gotta go

4741.12 --> 4747.12
uh all right if you like the show

4745.12 --> 4748.8
then please don't forget to rogan's it

4747.12 --> 4749.84
up and if you haven't already subscribe

4748.8 --> 4751.52
