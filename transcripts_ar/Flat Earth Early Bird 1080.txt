button

77.84 --> 82.479
that will be much appreciated

81.2 --> 85.28
so

82.479 --> 86.72
yeah i'm starting a little late

85.28 --> 89.36
i

86.72 --> 89.36
slept in

89.68 --> 96.07900000000001
woke up pretty much 15 minutes before i

92.079 --> 96.079
was supposed to be starting the show

96.32 --> 100.15899999999999
yeah the weather today is quite

97.68 --> 103.28
different

100.159 --> 103.28
it's very cloudy

103.92 --> 109.52
and grayish because of that

106.64 --> 109.52
missing the sun

111.36 --> 116.32
it's barely any wind

113.2 --> 118.799
it's like seems completely wind still

116.32 --> 118.79899999999999
right now

119.36 --> 123.92
that's just this giant cloud bank up

121.68 --> 123.92
there

125.28 --> 127.36
no rain

126.399 --> 130.72
but

127.36 --> 130.72
i don't know that might change

131.36 --> 135.959
it's kind of

132.4 --> 135.959
a gray day

142.8 --> 146.239
hello

143.84 --> 150.879
jeff gas head first in chat slow mo moon

146.239 --> 150.879
buggy crockett old horse radborn

151.44 --> 154.16
good to see you

154.72 --> 158.48
it is wednesday the 24th

157.68 --> 162.04000000000002
of

158.48 --> 162.04
november 2021.

165.84 --> 168.84
hmm

170.239 --> 173.59900000000002
yeah

172.0 --> 176.0
and yeah my show is going to be a little

173.599 --> 177.599
short today

176.0 --> 181.76
uh

177.599 --> 181.76
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

182.0 --> 187.36
alright so my show yesterday got a lot

183.76 --> 189.519
of views so i guess that

187.36 --> 191.36
the announcement of antonio subaret's

189.519 --> 194.239
got a lot of clicks

191.36 --> 194.239
not surprising

194.959 --> 199.84
he was a first wave flat earther after

197.44 --> 199.84
all

209.2 --> 212.2
right

213.2 --> 217.2
yeah it's still kind of sitting on me

220.0 --> 222.4
right

223.92 --> 228.319
i think i had like some kind of a

225.68 --> 230.959
flashback dream a bit

228.319 --> 232.07999999999998
to like the early flat earth days

230.959 --> 234.31900000000002
because

232.08 --> 236.72
for me

234.319 --> 239.04
like i have weird connections with the

236.72 --> 242.239
two through the dark world like

239.04 --> 245.04
in the first few years i had like really

242.239 --> 246.799
vivid dark world memories as i called it

245.04 --> 249.12
back then

246.799 --> 253.799
all over the place and that some of

249.12 --> 253.799
those included antonio subaretz

257.919 --> 262.32
right and some of those include patricia

260.16 --> 264.24
steer especially their situation

262.32 --> 265.84
together i was really preoccupied with

264.24 --> 267.84000000000003
that

265.84 --> 270.79999999999995
at the time

267.84 --> 270.79999999999995
david weiss

272.24 --> 276.16
like

273.6 --> 276.16
who else

276.8 --> 280.96000000000004
right

277.84 --> 280.96
well those guys

281.04 --> 284.24
in the visions that is

285.84 --> 288.15999999999997
uh

295.84 --> 301.19899999999996
i right just watching owen benjamin from

298.16 --> 301.199
uh yesterday

303.44 --> 306.88
it got just got a bit of a good part out

305.52 --> 309.19899999999996
of that because

306.88 --> 311.199
in the first 15 minutes he's playing

309.199 --> 314.72
like an snl skit

311.199 --> 317.44
that is actually really funny

314.72 --> 320.08000000000004
for a change

317.44 --> 322.71999999999997
like it's hilarious because it's playing

320.08 --> 322.71999999999997
onto the

322.88 --> 326.8
onto the insane level of similarities

325.759 --> 329.12
between

326.8 --> 331.52000000000004
the typical republican and the typical

329.12 --> 334.32
democrat

331.52 --> 334.32
like asking

334.4 --> 339.19899999999996
like they put it into a game show

337.039 --> 341.759
put a supposed republican and a supposed

339.199 --> 341.759
democrat

342.08 --> 347.12
they have to guess like okay is this

344.32 --> 349.68
comment republican or democrat or like

347.12 --> 353.84000000000003
is he a republican or not

349.68 --> 356.319
and then yeah just like a sentence

353.84 --> 359.35999999999996
but they can't make up out of it what

356.319 --> 361.03900000000004
their opinion etc is supposed to be

359.36 --> 363.6
because they keep on asking like but

361.039 --> 365.199
what in what context do you mean that

363.6 --> 367.44
but they don't get to hear it so they

365.199 --> 370.319
constantly keep on guessing

367.44 --> 372.4
like is this republican or is it not a

370.319 --> 374.24
republican but since they don't get

372.4 --> 376.63899999999995
enough information they they keep

374.24 --> 379.12
guessing wrong it's hilarious

376.639 --> 379.12
brilliant

379.759 --> 384.08000000000004
really funny

381.28 --> 384.08
for a change

386.639 --> 390.40000000000003
so yeah

387.84 --> 394.15999999999997
if you haven't seen that

390.4 --> 396.15999999999997
definitely recommend you watch bit shoot

394.16 --> 398.319
you watch owen benjamin on bitchute i

396.16 --> 398.319
know

398.8 --> 404.08
yeah or the original snl but

402.16 --> 406.47900000000004
i'll link you up to the specific show

404.08 --> 408.96
and it's like somewhere in between 10

406.479 --> 411.36
and 15 minutes into the show it's really

408.96 --> 411.35999999999996
funny

413.919 --> 417.4
hey mike sidoonich

422.56 --> 427.68
right i haven't gotten to watching the

424.56 --> 430.0
rest of the home benjamin though

427.68 --> 430.0
uh

431.36 --> 434.16
let's see what

434.84 --> 442.31899999999996
else i was gaming a lot yesterday

438.639 --> 442.319
making some headway in the game

444.4 --> 447.75899999999996
the other pathfinder game

449.12 --> 454.4
my original assessments still stand

452.24 --> 459.12
by the way about it like it seems like

454.4 --> 459.12
it has some weird sjw influence

459.44 --> 464.599
not super overt but it is there

470.8 --> 474.0
oh yeah

472.319 --> 476.8
jirenism

474.0 --> 479.12
uploaded an old video of an old debate

476.8 --> 482.24
also from antonio subaretz

479.12 --> 482.24
yeah in the early days

482.319 --> 485.199
with ballers

485.759 --> 489.28000000000003
he was so

487.039 --> 491.039
in the flow back then

489.28 --> 493.84
and he was like one of the first to

491.039 --> 493.84
really get that

495.599 --> 498.479
of course over the years he's changed a

497.44 --> 500.56
lot

498.479 --> 503.52
but still in that time it was quite

500.56 --> 503.52
revolutionary

504.84 --> 508.56
uh let's see

517.839 --> 523.36
oh wait oh there was a kiwi alive i

519.919 --> 523.36
completely forgot about that

531.44 --> 536.5600000000001
oh yeah yeah almost forgot

534.08 --> 538.8000000000001
dude i i watch infowars people know that

536.56 --> 543.279
about me

538.8 --> 543.279
made by jim bob got on like the uh

543.519 --> 546.88
the american journal show

547.12 --> 551.68
to promote his book that was amazing and

549.519 --> 553.839
he like even corrected

551.68 --> 556.88
harrison

553.839 --> 559.519
on some idea he had

556.88 --> 562.08
and he did it very eloquently that was

559.519 --> 565.04
an unexpected surprise to see him just

562.08 --> 565.0400000000001
pop up on there

565.68 --> 570.8389999999999
i was mentioned on qes oh okay

581.6 --> 586.08
i've been playing age of empires what

586.24 --> 592.64
okay

587.839 --> 594.6400000000001
the old game or one of the newer ones

592.64 --> 597.92
my interest kind of dropped off after

594.64 --> 597.92
age of empires 3.

598.24 --> 604.0790000000001
that was a really good game and it was

600.72 --> 607.839
graphic wise really simple

604.079 --> 607.8389999999999
it is still an interesting game

611.279 --> 615.76
but after that it i lost interest

616.399 --> 621.12
but new hd

618.72 --> 624.399
so they

621.12 --> 626.8
enhance the graphics i guess

624.399 --> 626.8
all right

627.839 --> 633.12
a gadget inspector could see you

631.04 --> 634.88
did not get your alert

633.12 --> 636.5600000000001
betty was talking about

634.88 --> 639.12
what

636.56 --> 639.1199999999999
what about

639.68 --> 643.3599999999999
dammit they were talking about me and i

641.76 --> 647.079
completely missed

643.36 --> 647.0790000000001
the entire thing

658.959 --> 664.0
new hd computer okay so yeah that's

664.48 --> 667.48
typical

675.76 --> 680.64
it's so typical because back in the day

678.56 --> 682.2399999999999
computer games were like

680.64 --> 684.0
made

682.24 --> 685.279
efficient

684.0 --> 687.519
because

685.279 --> 689.519
getting things programming things and

687.519 --> 693.04
the modeling system they use for the

689.519 --> 696.64
graphics know that to be efficient

693.04 --> 696.64
was easier to develop

696.959 --> 702.88
right

698.72 --> 705.0400000000001
than like high-end details

702.88 --> 708.16
but now with like

705.04 --> 709.8389999999999
computers being so insanely powerful

708.16 --> 712.0
the newer ones

709.839 --> 713.9200000000001
like i get the feeling like the entire

712.0 --> 714.8
industry with the gaming and all that is

713.92 --> 716.639
just

714.8 --> 719.1999999999999
getting kind of sloppy like they're

716.639 --> 721.36
losing their interest in efficiency so

719.2 --> 724.8000000000001
they're just like oh let's look use the

721.36 --> 724.8000000000001
latest standardized system

726.079 --> 730.0
but everything gets clunky

728.32 --> 732.399
so it's like oh it's

730.0 --> 735.519
oh with this graphics engine you can do

732.399 --> 737.92
this slightly better level it's like 20

735.519 --> 741.44
percent more cool

737.92 --> 743.12
but it's only a hundred percent slower

741.44 --> 746.5600000000001
so you're gonna have to get a stronger

743.12 --> 746.5600000000001
computer right

746.72 --> 750.32
that's very typical that happens

750.959 --> 758.5189999999999
some say you invented our what

755.519 --> 758.519
what

764.56 --> 767.3599999999999
narrow slit

768.399 --> 775.279
a saying of mine

771.12 --> 775.279
she was quoting a saying of mine huh

775.92 --> 779.5999999999999
hello lsg by the way

782.399 --> 790.959
slanted you mean the optical slant

786.24 --> 790.9590000000001
the intuitive description of your view

792.079 --> 796.079
i don't know what that has to do with

793.44 --> 796.0790000000001
this slit

799.04 --> 807.12
only thing that i've inserted in like

801.44 --> 807.12
double slit experiment is that i believe

807.44 --> 811.0400000000001
there's an extra effect happening

809.839 --> 814.0
when light

811.04 --> 817.279
moves in close proximity to a surface

814.0 --> 819.76
and i call it the diffraction cascade

817.279 --> 822.16
which is a description

819.76 --> 823.279
of something that i suspect is like a

822.16 --> 827.36
separate

823.279 --> 830.24
effect not really due to the nature of

827.36 --> 834.24
the form of its substance

830.24 --> 835.76
but instead like an another effect

834.24 --> 840.839
so which one was it

835.76 --> 840.8389999999999
optical slant or diffraction cascade

863.12 --> 866.639
optical slant all right

865.36 --> 868.8000000000001
huh

866.639 --> 870.8
that's cool

868.8 --> 872.4799999999999
well the optical slant is a pretty old

870.8 --> 875.76
discovery

872.48 --> 878.0
that that was even before

875.76 --> 880.0
before we figured out the geomet yeah

878.0 --> 882.959
the lack of geometric nature of the

880.0 --> 884.399
horizon and all that

882.959 --> 886.88
because everybody was just trying to

884.399 --> 888.959
figure out like how do we size this up

886.88 --> 891.36
how do we look at this

888.959 --> 893.3599999999999
and while everybody was just

891.36 --> 895.04
bickering back and forth about that at

893.36 --> 897.839
the time a lot

895.04 --> 899.92
everybody had their opinions and was all

897.839 --> 902.24
related to what was being said from the

899.92 --> 904.0
outside including by ballers and i was

902.24 --> 906.8
just trying the size of like what am i

904.0 --> 909.36
looking at here like what do does my

906.8 --> 910.959
intuition my spatial intuition say i'm

909.36 --> 912.8000000000001
actually looking at

910.959 --> 915.279
and that's how i devised the optical

912.8 --> 915.279
slant

915.76 --> 918.48
with the

917.199 --> 922.0
infamous

918.48 --> 922.0
eyeball and stick picture

923.6 --> 927.24
let me find it

927.76 --> 931.88
it's always here on my desktop

946.399 --> 948.639
um

950.079 --> 953.079
right

956.399 --> 959.72
this one

971.6 --> 973.839
what

975.68 --> 977.92
oh

978.56 --> 983.199
yeah mr sensible and ranty are quite the

981.199 --> 986.639
team

983.199 --> 989.639
attack team of gross

986.639 --> 989.639
indeed

1006.48 --> 1009.88
hello cleary

1023.279 --> 1026.959
yeah dude

1024.64 --> 1028.88
i think that the trolls that really like

1026.959 --> 1030.4
the downfall thing are kind of squirting

1028.88 --> 1032.4
because they get the feeling that

1030.4 --> 1035.439
youtube is taking it away

1032.4 --> 1037.8390000000002
i'm not seeing any dislikes

1035.439 --> 1039.76
apparently people that have wrenches

1037.839 --> 1042.319
don't get to see the dislikes but

1039.76 --> 1044.72
regular commenters do which is really

1042.319 --> 1044.72
weird

1045.439 --> 1050.799
it's almost like a manipulative message

1049.039 --> 1053.52
from the engineer

1050.799 --> 1055.52
the engineer designers of the system

1053.52 --> 1057.6
from youtube like oh

1055.52 --> 1060.559
stop being distracted by its in

1057.6 --> 1060.559
popularity

1060.96 --> 1065.24
but the rest can see it

1067.76 --> 1074.32
let's i'd say that would have a

1069.919 --> 1074.3200000000002
further compartmentalizing effect

1077.6 --> 1082.6399999999999
thought youtube took away down counts

1080.48 --> 1084.559
well it only seems to be working for

1082.64 --> 1086.88
people that have wrenches and channel

1084.559 --> 1089.6789999999999
owners because regular

1086.88 --> 1091.6000000000001
non-channel owning commenters

1089.679 --> 1095.8400000000001
can still see the dislikes that's what

1091.6 --> 1095.84
i've derived from it so far

1097.919 --> 1101.76
yesterday so but today it's gone

1100.32 --> 1103.039
okay

1101.76 --> 1105.039
or it's just

1103.039 --> 1108.679
really weird and random

1105.039 --> 1108.679
i don't know man

1112.4 --> 1115.679
hardcore alpha

1114.32 --> 1118.6789999999999
okay

1115.679 --> 1118.679
okay

1122.559 --> 1127.36
all those wrenches no i see five thumbs

1125.52 --> 1129.36
up cleary

1127.36 --> 1131.4399999999998
don't worry about it

1129.36 --> 1133.1999999999998
like it really doesn't matter it never

1131.44 --> 1136.2
really mattered

1133.2 --> 1136.2
right

1138.08 --> 1143.9189999999999
it's like a separate thing

1141.12 --> 1146.0
it's like oh that

1143.919 --> 1148.3200000000002
i'm doing my show it's in the building

1146.0 --> 1150.48
outside of the building happens to be a

1148.32 --> 1152.24
dumpster oh look there's a lot of people

1150.48 --> 1153.6
suddenly dumping garbage in that

1152.24 --> 1156.799
dumpster

1153.6 --> 1159.52
to try to troll or something but yeah

1156.799 --> 1161.52
i'm just doing my show inside

1159.52 --> 1163.52
i'm not picking up on that i mean

1161.52 --> 1165.84
there's not a window to that back alley

1163.52 --> 1165.84
or anything

1166.0 --> 1172.48
so yeah it might be a little messy but

1168.24 --> 1172.48
it's not really influencing my show

1174.96 --> 1178.16
i mean

1176.08 --> 1180.3999999999999
when that first started happening i got

1178.16 --> 1183.919
really frustrated and all that and then

1180.4 --> 1188.0
like my 1 000 subscribers damn it

1183.919 --> 1188.0
yeah but that's years ago now

1191.76 --> 1194.32
it doesn't really matter it never really

1193.44 --> 1195.52
did

1194.32 --> 1197.52
like i'm

1195.52 --> 1199.2
i think that's it's ridiculous youtube

1197.52 --> 1201.039
is even doing it

1199.2 --> 1203.679
like why hide

1201.039 --> 1205.44
what's actually happening

1203.679 --> 1209.1200000000001
like

1205.44 --> 1211.919
yeah yeah youtube you contracted trolls

1209.12 --> 1213.12
trolls are drawn

1211.919 --> 1216.4
to

1213.12 --> 1216.3999999999999
the youtube platform

1219.36 --> 1223.6
like masking it

1221.2 --> 1225.919
by taking away the dislike

1223.6 --> 1227.6789999999999
view ability is not gonna get rid of

1225.919 --> 1229.44
that problem

1227.679 --> 1230.3200000000002
it's not really gonna soothe it out

1229.44 --> 1232.64
either

1230.32 --> 1234.6399999999999
trolls are just gonna get more tenacious

1232.64 --> 1236.3200000000002
they're to find other ways to get in to

1234.64 --> 1238.4
try and get in your face

1236.32 --> 1241.52
just a bunch of dislikes

1238.4 --> 1241.52
is pretty harmless

1247.6 --> 1253.8799999999999
it doesn't really do anything anyway

1250.88 --> 1253.88
uh

1271.76 --> 1276.96
hmm

1274.0 --> 1278.08
yes at least g yeah i kind of feel the

1276.96 --> 1280.48
same

1278.08 --> 1282.8799999999999
i mean i'm not like really heartbroken

1280.48 --> 1282.88
over it

1286.96 --> 1293.44
but yeah in a way antonio was like

1290.559 --> 1296.8799999999999
family and it kind of turned sour

1293.44 --> 1299.44
but we had really good times

1296.88 --> 1299.44
so yeah

1301.28 --> 1306.32
been missing the old antonio subrats but

1304.08 --> 1309.28
now i know he's not coming back like

1306.32 --> 1309.28
that again

1309.36 --> 1312.9599999999998
so i i get your feeling

1316.08 --> 1320.8799999999999
why does youtube recommend jose's show

1318.48 --> 1320.88
because

1322.08 --> 1326.6789999999999
they think jose's show is cool

1344.24 --> 1349.039
i mean who over at youtube

1347.039 --> 1350.48
which isn't like yeah they're they're a

1349.039 --> 1354.1589999999999
lot of them are like highly

1350.48 --> 1356.559
indoctrinated with pc and sjw [ __ ]

1354.159 --> 1359.1200000000001
so to have a show where a

1356.559 --> 1361.36
guy that kind of talks like he's a third

1359.12 --> 1364.08
world country guy

1361.36 --> 1366.559
where he is in control

1364.08 --> 1366.559
and like

1366.96 --> 1370.72
managing

1368.32 --> 1372.799
very british and american sounding

1370.72 --> 1376.08
people and basically having them in his

1372.799 --> 1377.36
room under his control must be kind of

1376.08 --> 1380.32
soothing

1377.36 --> 1382.1589999999999
to weirdly programmed sjw people it's

1380.32 --> 1384.799
like oh oh yeah that's the right setup

1382.159 --> 1386.5590000000002
like oh yeah the

1384.799 --> 1389.12
the the brown

1386.559 --> 1390.8799999999999
yeah southern type of accent

1389.12 --> 1393.36
guy

1390.88 --> 1395.3600000000001
is like talking down and having control

1393.36 --> 1397.1999999999998
over british and americans that are

1395.36 --> 1398.0
obviously

1397.2 --> 1400.48
like

1398.0 --> 1402.88
native to those regions

1400.48 --> 1404.4
yeah that must be that's a good optic so

1402.88 --> 1405.3600000000001
they're probably promoting it because of

1404.4 --> 1408.5590000000002
that

1405.36 --> 1410.3999999999999
i'm i'm roughly guessing

1408.559 --> 1413.44
retirement home

1410.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
right yeah yeah it has been like a

1413.44 --> 1417.8400000000001
a baller boomer retirement home indeed

1424.0 --> 1430.84
red hoodies cigarettes trailer park boys

1427.52 --> 1430.84
team what

1435.919 --> 1442.5590000000002
management manage promotion no no it's

1439.6 --> 1444.3999999999999
automated pro no

1442.559 --> 1446.8799999999999
i did and i'm not saying there's like

1444.4 --> 1449.76
conscious attention there's not like a

1446.88 --> 1451.8400000000001
manager that's making the decision like

1449.76 --> 1455.279
to up them on the promotion list no it's

1451.84 --> 1458.9599999999998
fully automated it's still the sjw

1455.279 --> 1461.84
automated pc promotion program

1458.96 --> 1465.1200000000001
it's algorithmically promoted because he

1461.84 --> 1465.12
falls in a certain

1465.44 --> 1472.0800000000002
operating frequency

1467.679 --> 1473.8400000000001
and then you get promoted he knew that

1472.08 --> 1475.84
he's been kind of consciously trying to

1473.84 --> 1479.12
aim for that since the beginning since

1475.84 --> 1483.559
he started doing his own shows

1479.12 --> 1483.559
just trying to play the algorithm

1487.36 --> 1492.4399999999998
oh okay leg

1489.44 --> 1492.44
huh

1509.52 --> 1511.9189999999999
all right

1512.0 --> 1516.96
okay yeah okay inspector look i think

1514.4 --> 1518.64
that antonio had been added like way

1516.96 --> 1519.679
past

1518.64 --> 1521.1200000000001
where i

1519.679 --> 1524.4
disconnected

1521.12 --> 1524.3999999999999
because of all the infighting

1525.52 --> 1529.44
and we didn't really connect like we

1527.12 --> 1531.12
connected before that time like

1529.44 --> 1534.0800000000002
one-on-one

1531.12 --> 1534.08
in the old days

1534.32 --> 1537.84
but

1535.12 --> 1540.1589999999999
after that yeah he got super safanye he

1537.84 --> 1543.6789999999999
kind of associated me with patricia's

1540.159 --> 1547.919
deer and he just took his distance

1543.679 --> 1547.919
and like he has people around him

1548.159 --> 1554.24
that defend him by getting really

1551.679 --> 1555.76
aggressively trolling against those they

1554.24 --> 1558.0
perceive

1555.76 --> 1559.919
are gonna cause trouble somehow for

1558.0 --> 1561.44
antonio that was like something that

1559.919 --> 1563.44
happened a lot

1561.44 --> 1566.48
so i just stayed away it's like okay

1563.44 --> 1570.3600000000001
this is not a safe place anymore

1566.48 --> 1570.3600000000001
for the likes of me

1571.919 --> 1577.2
socially that is

1574.32 --> 1577.2
socially safe

1577.76 --> 1583.4
right so i haven't watched any of his

1579.52 --> 1583.4
shows for a long time

1592.4 --> 1595.48
all right

1607.84 --> 1610.48
anyway

1610.88 --> 1616.7990000000002
what is a top fe

1613.919 --> 1616.7990000000002
what does that mean

1618.48 --> 1622.64
who is at the top good luck

1622.88 --> 1627.24
good luck figuring that one out

1628.159 --> 1634.0
i mean when it comes to like

1631.279 --> 1634.799
truly figuring things out way beyond

1634.0 --> 1637.36
where

1634.799 --> 1640.32
peop where the average comfort zone is

1637.36 --> 1643.279
i'd say i'm at the top

1640.32 --> 1646.32
but i am not like a frontline main

1643.279 --> 1650.559
spokesperson type of guy that like oh

1646.32 --> 1653.96
that wields the masses no it's

1650.559 --> 1653.96
quite the opposite

1654.24 --> 1659.36
i'm typically the guy that like

1657.2 --> 1662.159
all the flat earthers out there they are

1659.36 --> 1664.799
getting comfortable in their oversight

1662.159 --> 1666.72
and then i just like almost troll them

1664.799 --> 1668.48
with information from the future they

1666.72 --> 1670.96
can't deal with yet

1668.48 --> 1673.2
that's what i like to do

1670.96 --> 1676.6000000000001
people are not always thankful for me

1673.2 --> 1676.6000000000001
doing that

1682.64 --> 1686.88
oh god yeah i remember that cleary

1688.64 --> 1691.64
ugh

1706.0 --> 1709.0
okay

1713.52 --> 1718.399
yes guys inspect yeah i saw that one

1715.52 --> 1718.399
there's a good video

1721.44 --> 1724.3990000000001
and that was

1722.96 --> 1728.0
what was happening

1724.399 --> 1730.0
a lot in the first wave

1728.0 --> 1733.039
right google just

1730.0 --> 1733.039
the google video

1734.48 --> 1738.559
the platform for

1736.88 --> 1740.88
for streaming

1738.559 --> 1743.279
it just opened up it like literally

1740.88 --> 1745.5200000000002
opened its doors and like a lot of flat

1743.279 --> 1748.08
earthers and ballers just got in there

1745.52 --> 1748.08
and started

1748.64 --> 1752.72
going back and forth

1750.399 --> 1753.6
and antonio had a pretty big role in

1752.72 --> 1755.2
that

1753.6 --> 1757.52
in the first wave

1755.2 --> 1760.24
and yeah that video was typically what

1757.52 --> 1760.24
that was like

1763.84 --> 1767.799
there was a lot of energy

1768.159 --> 1771.3600000000001
we were all

1769.36 --> 1774.76
threading fresh

1771.36 --> 1774.76
new ground

1787.679 --> 1792.44
did i read his book no i haven't

1794.0 --> 1799.679
book of the sun or something right

1796.64 --> 1803.3200000000002
i have no idea what is in there

1799.679 --> 1803.3200000000002
no idea whatsoever

1816.0 --> 1821.399
okay thank you that fellow for the 99

1818.399 --> 1821.399
cents

1908.64 --> 1912.5590000000002
do anybody know what happened to him

1913.279 --> 1916.799
i don't know

1914.48 --> 1916.799
more

1919.039 --> 1924.399
apparently it was a dying in the sleep

1922.08 --> 1926.1589999999999
situation

1924.399 --> 1929.36
we all knew

1926.159 --> 1931.7600000000002
he had cancer for a while

1929.36 --> 1935.1999999999998
and we don't know how he was doing at

1931.76 --> 1937.519
that i know he was getting some

1935.2 --> 1937.519
help

1938.399 --> 1941.9189999999999
but

1939.519 --> 1944.24
i don't know what he was like if he was

1941.919 --> 1946.5590000000002
even like enrolling in hospital

1944.24 --> 1947.76
treatment or something terrible like

1946.559 --> 1948.8799999999999
that

1947.76 --> 1952.8799999999999
like i

1948.88 --> 1952.88
he wouldn't do that at first hand

1954.559 --> 1961.0
so yeah throat cancer was it yeah

1957.679 --> 1961.0
that's terrible

1970.799 --> 1976.2
yeah

1971.679 --> 1976.2
so yeah it could have been that

1976.799 --> 1980.12
i don't know

2001.44 --> 2005.76
oh my god he was doing conventional oh

2008.24 --> 2012.96
yeah

2010.48 --> 2015.1200000000001
well that's extremely dangerous

2012.96 --> 2017.6000000000001
like especially

2015.12 --> 2019.5189999999998
chemotherapy like what that does to your

2017.6 --> 2023.4399999999998
body i don't know if he was doing that

2019.519 --> 2023.44
or if he was doing radiation but

2028.559 --> 2032.44
it'll mess you up

2033.6 --> 2036.8799999999999
ah taking chemo

2039.2 --> 2043.8400000000001
that's quite

2041.36 --> 2047.6399999999999
stupid in my opinion

2043.84 --> 2047.6399999999999
that he would do that

2051.119 --> 2054.3990000000003
i mean the guy like that he should have

2052.96 --> 2055.839
known better

2054.399 --> 2058.399
should have just

2055.839 --> 2058.399
trusted

2058.8 --> 2064.599
but yeah it's all too late now anyway

2103.119 --> 2105.359
huh

2106.24 --> 2110.3999999999996
i didn't know by the way that his

2107.839 --> 2112.72
daughters were also like active on the

2110.4 --> 2117.1600000000003
internet

2112.72 --> 2117.16
steamy traveler hmm

2123.28 --> 2128.4
okay and that flat fellow is coming in

2125.359 --> 2132.48
with it i just noticed that

2128.4 --> 2132.48
the rectangular looping question

2132.96 --> 2137.04
if we compare rectangular looping earth

2135.359 --> 2139.5989999999997
to a video game

2137.04 --> 2143.359
would a character exit left

2139.599 --> 2147.44
and re-enter right yes

2143.359 --> 2147.44
but from their perspective

2148.16 --> 2155.1189999999997
it's the world scrolling underneath it

2152.96 --> 2158.079
and it seems just like a seamless

2155.119 --> 2160.079
connection

2158.079 --> 2162.5600000000004
and that contrast

2160.079 --> 2164.32
of viewing it like that is important to

2162.56 --> 2166.72
realize

2164.32 --> 2168.96
like yes if you take

2166.72 --> 2171.1189999999997
anchored on the map you see that

2168.96 --> 2173.04
rectangle then yeah you walk over there

2171.119 --> 2174.079
yeah that's connected to there you walk

2173.04 --> 2177.2
back

2174.079 --> 2179.3590000000004
but to the person to the viewer

2177.2 --> 2184.359
it's the world scrolling underneath it

2179.359 --> 2184.359
and then the same part reappears

2196.8 --> 2200.96
hmm

2197.839 --> 2206.0789999999997
wow minus 23

2200.96 --> 2209.079
celsius wow that's like super freezing

2206.079 --> 2209.079
man

2215.2 --> 2219.2799999999997
yeah that's like

2216.8 --> 2221.28
ice shards time

2219.28 --> 2224.88
that kind of weather

2221.28 --> 2227.6800000000003
so when ice sharks start to form on

2224.88 --> 2230.0
like along roofs and all that

2227.68 --> 2230.0
move

2231.76 --> 2236.6400000000003
what's the temperature here

2233.839 --> 2239.04
it's it's still well above

2236.64 --> 2242.92
zero i'm sure yeah eight degrees eight

2239.04 --> 2242.92
degrees celsius here

2247.52 --> 2252.16
are you still in 80 12.

2249.92 --> 2254.64
yeah i'm doing i'm doing fine start a

2252.16 --> 2254.64
little late

2254.839 --> 2258.24
i uh

2258.88 --> 2262.88
i feel a bit

2260.48 --> 2264.8
i don't know a bit bit tiresome a bit

2262.88 --> 2266.96
tired compared to yesterday but then

2264.8 --> 2268.2400000000002
again yesterday was this amazing sun and

2266.96 --> 2273.119
it really

2268.24 --> 2273.1189999999997
woke me up now there isn't any

2276.24 --> 2280.9599999999996
ah yes that flat fellow you're welcome

2282.079 --> 2286.6400000000003
i'm always ready to explain my

2284.16 --> 2288.56
conceptions as well as i can right like

2286.64 --> 2291.92
yesterday i spent

2288.56 --> 2294.56
quite a few minutes trying to explain

2291.92 --> 2297.28
the holographic light

2294.56 --> 2300.16
and how it's not coming from a source

2297.28 --> 2302.8
and how you could compare that that's

2300.16 --> 2306.52
really complicated stuff to imagine it

2302.8 --> 2308.4
requires a lot of detailed explaining

2306.52 --> 2310.96
consistently

2308.4 --> 2312.8
the consistence is critical because that

2310.96 --> 2315.359
shows that i actually

2312.8 --> 2319.04
have a structural oversight

2315.359 --> 2319.04
over my conception of it

2324.24 --> 2330.3999999999996
my i myself think that the rectangular

2327.2 --> 2332.24
map layout is probably easier

2330.4 --> 2335.76
to imagine although like the

2332.24 --> 2338.72
implications are more extreme

2335.76 --> 2341.8390000000004
like for the entire nature of the realm

2338.72 --> 2345.1189999999997
but it's easier to get an oversight on

2341.839 --> 2346.96
how that works compared to like oh yeah

2345.119 --> 2349.52
all those lights you see at the edge of

2346.96 --> 2352.16
your vision like a demi globe

2349.52 --> 2354.72
those aren't objects the light isn't

2352.16 --> 2357.5989999999997
actually literally coming from where you

2354.72 --> 2357.5989999999997
see that light

2358.0 --> 2363.04
it's just manifesting with that little

2360.48 --> 2365.68
light at its epicenter as like a

2363.04 --> 2369.599
holographic stamp

2365.68 --> 2371.839
of its signature in relation to you

2369.599 --> 2374.32
yeah that's a lot more difficult to

2371.839 --> 2377.2
really get across so i've spent quite a

2374.32 --> 2377.2000000000003
few hours

2378.16 --> 2382.72
over the years explaining that trying to

2380.56 --> 2385.7599999999998
explain it

2382.72 --> 2385.7599999999998
like i did yesterday

2387.28 --> 2390.48
and i've gotten a lot better at it by

2389.119 --> 2391.44
the way

2390.48 --> 2393.599
like if

2391.44 --> 2396.48
the first year trying to do that was

2393.599 --> 2398.56
just like whoa dude

2396.48 --> 2400.64
i don't know what this is but there's

2398.56 --> 2402.96
something there i just can't describe it

2400.64 --> 2406.72
yet and i don't understand

2402.96 --> 2406.7200000000003
but i know it's not that

2406.96 --> 2410.48
ugh

2408.56 --> 2412.72
i've got so much more detail to present

2410.48 --> 2412.72
now

2416.96 --> 2421.04
ah people say they have more trouble

2418.56 --> 2422.0
when it's a full moon sleeping

2421.04 --> 2424.48
yeah

2422.0 --> 2427.599
doesn't surprise me i always get very

2424.48 --> 2429.599
restless when there's a full moon

2427.599 --> 2431.76
but it's mostly like just the the way

2429.599 --> 2435.92
your mind operates because

2431.76 --> 2435.92
if i decide to go to bed

2436.0 --> 2441.28
then i the restless is not going to

2438.319 --> 2443.839
prevent me from actually sleeping

2441.28 --> 2446.3190000000004
but what the restlessness from full moon

2443.839 --> 2448.64
typically does do to me is kind of make

2446.319 --> 2450.64
me forget about time and then certainly

2448.64 --> 2453.2
i stay up super late

2450.64 --> 2455.92
just because i'm restless

2453.2 --> 2458.24
and i kind of let let that slip and then

2455.92 --> 2460.079
i yeah lost time

2458.24 --> 2462.56
that typically happens to me but once i

2460.079 --> 2465.2000000000003
realized like oh

2462.56 --> 2468.4
i'm kind of restless

2465.2 --> 2471.5989999999997
i'm i must now stop

2468.4 --> 2474.1600000000003
giving into it and kind of like take the

2471.599 --> 2476.1600000000003
night back and make sure i get sleep

2474.16 --> 2477.04
and then when i do that it works out

2476.16 --> 2479.359
great

2477.04 --> 2480.88
i like even with the restlesses i don't

2479.359 --> 2483.359
have trouble sleeping i actually

2480.88 --> 2484.88
typically tend to dream more vividly

2483.359 --> 2489.4
when i'm like that

2484.88 --> 2489.4
once i go to the sleeping part

2497.52 --> 2503.359
also thoughts about where the heat and

2500.0 --> 2505.44
radiation comes from

2503.359 --> 2508.7599999999998
it's manifesting it's part of the light

2505.44 --> 2508.76
that's manifesting

2511.2 --> 2514.96
so every time you'd ask where is it

2513.28 --> 2516.4
coming from it isn't coming from

2514.96 --> 2519.04
anywhere

2516.4 --> 2521.2000000000003
this is not a regular light transfer

2519.04 --> 2522.72
situation

2521.2 --> 2525.68
with an object

2522.72 --> 2527.9199999999996
it's manifesting

2525.68 --> 2530.2799999999997
it's not coming from anywhere it's just

2527.92 --> 2532.64
manifesting i know it's so

2530.28 --> 2534.8
counterintuitive compared to everything

2532.64 --> 2535.839
you've learned about light especially

2534.8 --> 2538.079
from a

2535.839 --> 2540.319
mechanical and engineering standpoint

2538.079 --> 2542.5600000000004
yeah yeah

2540.319 --> 2544.319
it's not a regular thing is it like oh

2542.56 --> 2546.4
look at all that light

2544.319 --> 2548.839
how intense how blinding oh yeah and

2546.4 --> 2550.8
it's not coming from anywhere it's just

2548.839 --> 2553.2799999999997
manifesting

2550.8 --> 2555.3590000000004
from nothing

2553.28 --> 2557.3590000000004
extracting its energy from the

2555.359 --> 2559.52
surrounding no doubt but it's not it

2557.359 --> 2562.4
doesn't actually have a

2559.52 --> 2563.68
specific origin point only an apparent

2562.4 --> 2565.359
one yeah

2563.68 --> 2568.16
it's very tough

2565.359 --> 2570.72
very tough to get your head around that

2568.16 --> 2573.5989999999997
manifest from where

2570.72 --> 2577.2799999999997
nowhere it's just manifesting from a

2573.599 --> 2577.28
specific angular relation

2577.359 --> 2584.319
that is anchored specifically to the

2580.48 --> 2584.319
position of the observation

2585.44 --> 2589.04
that's it

2587.68 --> 2591.359
there's no

2589.04 --> 2593.839
actual location from where it's

2591.359 --> 2593.839
emanating

2604.56 --> 2609.359
i just explained that literally just did

2607.119 --> 2609.359
that

2613.76 --> 2619.6800000000003
explain manifest well it's manifest

2617.599 --> 2621.119
it's coming into being

2619.68 --> 2622.56
it's forming

2621.119 --> 2624.48
it's arriving

2622.56 --> 2625.599
it's getting absorbed

2624.48 --> 2627.2
it's just

2625.599 --> 2630.0
not

2627.2 --> 2632.839
in accordance to conventional

2630.0 --> 2637.56
light generation and

2632.839 --> 2637.56
transfer it's just manifesting

2659.76 --> 2662.76
uh

2666.16 --> 2670.72
do i have any idea

2668.56 --> 2672.96
how to test all yeah dude i do it all

2670.72 --> 2675.1189999999997
the time steamy traveler that's

2672.96 --> 2678.079
i don't barely think of other than that

2675.119 --> 2680.4
that's not true i think of everything

2678.079 --> 2682.6400000000003
yeah duh

2680.4 --> 2682.64
look

2682.88 --> 2687.599
the testing the holographic nature

2688.839 --> 2693.44
is

2690.48 --> 2696.4
like that's almost undoable because it's

2693.44 --> 2698.96
holographic it's elusive right

2696.4 --> 2702.64
it's like the only real thing you can do

2698.96 --> 2705.28
is try to disprove it by proving

2702.64 --> 2708.0789999999997
euclidean nature by proving an origin

2705.28 --> 2710.4
point for the light by showing that

2708.079 --> 2712.7200000000003
things like perspective

2710.4 --> 2715.599
angular size change

2712.72 --> 2719.2799999999997
in for square law of light all these

2715.599 --> 2720.2400000000002
things that they apply if you can prove

2719.28 --> 2721.599
that

2720.24 --> 2723.9199999999996
then

2721.599 --> 2726.079
suddenly the holographic nature comes

2723.92 --> 2727.839
into question because now there's like

2726.079 --> 2729.52
evidence empirical evidence to the

2727.839 --> 2732.319
contrary

2729.52 --> 2735.119
now in reality there isn't any and

2732.319 --> 2737.599
that's why my holographic

2735.119 --> 2738.56
view of the celestial lights and its

2737.599 --> 2740.0
nature

2738.56 --> 2742.0
stands

2740.0 --> 2744.64
but beyond that point there's not a lot

2742.0 --> 2746.48
you could do you could just try to

2744.64 --> 2748.64
trace like

2746.48 --> 2750.56
how it manifests like

2748.64 --> 2751.7599999999998
how strong is the light

2750.56 --> 2753.839
from which

2751.76 --> 2755.8390000000004
vantage point from which observation

2753.839 --> 2758.4
point what happens to the light

2755.839 --> 2761.04
manifestation how is it manifesting what

2758.4 --> 2762.64
are the patterns it is manifesting with

2761.04 --> 2765.119
that's what you can derive from it and

2762.64 --> 2765.1189999999997
that's it

2768.48 --> 2772.8
you could perhaps like try to like

2770.4 --> 2773.92
somehow like blot out the effects or

2772.8 --> 2776.88
negate negated

2773.92 --> 2776.88
screw around

2777.599 --> 2781.839
but it's

2779.119 --> 2781.839
not easy

2782.56 --> 2786.839
to figure out how to do that

2788.24 --> 2792.72
it does produce actual oh yeah yeah keep

2791.52 --> 2795.28
keep doubling down on your

2792.72 --> 2797.68
presupposition professor field bill

2795.28 --> 2799.76
go ahead

2797.68 --> 2802.0
double down

2799.76 --> 2804.5600000000004
even though you don't actually have an

2802.0 --> 2804.56
evidence

2805.359 --> 2809.92
that it

2807.119 --> 2812.4
just even saying it does produce oh you

2809.92 --> 2814.319
mean the sun assumed to be a physical

2812.4 --> 2817.28
object in the euclidean position for

2814.319 --> 2820.16
which all the evidence is missing

2817.28 --> 2823.2000000000003
yeah i know you're just gonna resort

2820.16 --> 2824.8799999999997
back to that presupposition sneaked in

2823.2 --> 2826.96
that statement

2824.88 --> 2828.7200000000003
i know you will

2826.96 --> 2831.7200000000003
but you don't have evidence for any of

2828.72 --> 2831.72
that

2840.16 --> 2845.52
so when you use a magnifying glass to

2842.48 --> 2848.0
focus the light cause a burn

2845.52 --> 2850.8
yeah you're literally bending the light

2848.0 --> 2850.8
manifesting

2852.64 --> 2858.319
like none of that proves that the light

2855.28 --> 2860.1600000000003
has an origin point where it's generated

2858.319 --> 2863.2
and that the inverse square law applies

2860.16 --> 2865.52
none of the tests how does this work how

2863.2 --> 2867.359
does that none of it proves

2865.52 --> 2869.7599999999998
an origin point for all that light

2867.359 --> 2873.68
including the sunlight none of it does

2869.76 --> 2876.1600000000003
it's just like oh what happens when you

2873.68 --> 2877.9199999999996
deal with this manifested light for

2876.16 --> 2879.68
which there is no origin

2877.92 --> 2881.28
point provable

2879.68 --> 2882.96
yeah well this happens that happens oh

2881.28 --> 2883.8390000000004
yeah you can bend it you can lens it you

2882.96 --> 2885.44
can

2883.839 --> 2887.2799999999997
blot it out

2885.44 --> 2888.48
create a shadow and then you don't see

2887.28 --> 2890.0
it

2888.48 --> 2891.76
yeah all that

2890.0 --> 2892.8
doesn't prove an origin point of the

2891.76 --> 2897.0
light

2892.8 --> 2897.0
because it remains elusive

2904.16 --> 2911.24
all we got is the light arriving

2907.52 --> 2911.24
that's all we got

2919.92 --> 2923.92
photons

2921.839 --> 2925.599
well look there's there's technically

2923.92 --> 2928.04
nothing wrong with

2925.599 --> 2930.079
using the word photons it's just the

2928.04 --> 2931.839
implications of the word and the

2930.079 --> 2933.44
associations right

2931.839 --> 2936.88
because if you're going to go by the

2933.44 --> 2939.92
model where photons are assumed to be

2936.88 --> 2943.04
indivisible units

2939.92 --> 2944.64
that's where you're getting fallacious

2943.04 --> 2947.839
you can't prove that

2944.64 --> 2949.359
it's actually very unlikely that the

2947.839 --> 2950.7999999999997
assumed

2949.359 --> 2952.96
numerical

2950.8 --> 2955.76
photons

2952.96 --> 2957.119
it's very unlikely that that is like the

2955.76 --> 2959.8390000000004
ultimate

2957.119 --> 2961.2000000000003
light unit it isn't

2959.839 --> 2964.4
it's simply

2961.2 --> 2966.64
what was registered to be at the time

2964.4 --> 2968.96
the minimum

2966.64 --> 2970.5589999999997
inter yeah the minimum light interaction

2968.96 --> 2973.76
that would spur

2970.559 --> 2975.76
a physical response in matter

2973.76 --> 2979.3590000000004
like what is the minimum

2975.76 --> 2982.0
intensity that will spur a reaction

2979.359 --> 2983.7599999999998
from material the photoelectric effect

2982.0 --> 2984.8
and that

2983.76 --> 2986.079
yeah that

2984.8 --> 2989.2000000000003
amount

2986.079 --> 2991.6800000000003
that value was then assumed okay so that

2989.2 --> 2993.1189999999997
is a photon

2991.68 --> 2995.839
because if we

2993.119 --> 3000.079
lower the energy there is no registry of

2995.839 --> 3002.64
it with our specific tests

3000.079 --> 3005.599
right i bet they didn't

3002.64 --> 3008.24
like continue testing i've devised tests

3005.599 --> 3009.839
to actually prove that yeah you can

3008.24 --> 3012.64
have less

3009.839 --> 3015.2799999999997
than a photon

3012.64 --> 3018.16
a worth of energy it's very simple you

3015.28 --> 3019.92
take half a photon worth of energy

3018.16 --> 3022.96
two beams

3019.92 --> 3025.44
of that projectors and then

3022.96 --> 3028.16
aim it at exactly the same spot on a

3025.44 --> 3030.559
photoelectric plate i'll bet you

3028.16 --> 3034.24
it's going to trigger even though both

3030.559 --> 3037.3590000000004
light projectors had only half worth

3034.24 --> 3039.1189999999997
of photon energy light energy that's my

3037.359 --> 3041.839
suspicion

3039.119 --> 3044.96
it's probably not even that hard to test

3041.839 --> 3046.64
right because i conceive of light

3044.96 --> 3049.839
universally to be

3046.64 --> 3051.68
infinitely divisible beams or rather it

3049.839 --> 3054.16
doesn't really matter how you see them

3051.68 --> 3056.72
as what whether it is some kind of a

3054.16 --> 3058.96
weird infinitely small

3056.72 --> 3062.0
photon globule

3058.96 --> 3065.04
or whether it is a beam

3062.0 --> 3067.92
it's just not a wave because a wave is

3065.04 --> 3070.079
an effect it's not it doesn't reveal

3067.92 --> 3071.28
anything about the substance it is a

3070.079 --> 3072.6400000000003
wave off

3071.28 --> 3074.96
right that's where another

3072.64 --> 3076.24
misunderstanding of the light ether

3074.96 --> 3078.64
comes in

3076.24 --> 3081.1189999999997
i don't even go there it's

3078.64 --> 3081.1189999999997
it's like

3081.599 --> 3084.559
yeah

3082.559 --> 3087.7200000000003
that's a mistake that i don't dwell upon

3084.559 --> 3087.7200000000003
at all

3098.64 --> 3101.92
right so anything else

3108.8 --> 3114.079
right so yeah it doesn't produce photons

3112.24 --> 3115.359
the sun

3114.079 --> 3119.28
because

3115.359 --> 3121.52
it is not a thing producing the photons

3119.28 --> 3124.3190000000004
and photons are not really photons

3121.52 --> 3126.48
they're just a convention

3124.319 --> 3129.359
effectively

3126.48 --> 3131.52
and yeah just saying oh they do they do

3129.359 --> 3134.24
doesn't actually prove an origin point

3131.52 --> 3137.99
for the light

3134.24 --> 3141.12
of the celestials including the sun

3137.99 --> 3141.12
[Music]

3141.839 --> 3146.72
why do stars two equivalent planets do

3144.0 --> 3146.72
not twinkle

3148.64 --> 3152.1189999999997
i don't know

3158.16 --> 3163.359
by the way i think i have been seeing

3159.839 --> 3166.16
some planets in the night sky

3163.359 --> 3168.96
like it kind of stood out to me like two

3166.16 --> 3170.48
very bright stars which are usually like

3168.96 --> 3172.559
when they're that bright it's usually

3170.48 --> 3176.2400000000002
planets

3172.559 --> 3177.6800000000003
in the morning there's typically venus

3176.24 --> 3180.839
but this was in the middle of the night

3177.68 --> 3180.839
and two

3181.76 --> 3186.1600000000003
so i think that like two planets were

3183.68 --> 3186.16
visible

3186.4 --> 3190.76
or at least their light was out

3201.599 --> 3208.28
yes roger mc yesterday's show had it

3204.4 --> 3208.28
literally in the title

3220.72 --> 3223.72
okay

3224.88 --> 3227.88
do

3248.559 --> 3251.8390000000004
yeah really

3266.24 --> 3271.7599999999998
yeah i'm sorry it's like there's nothing

3268.64 --> 3274.0789999999997
you can do to stop me

3271.76 --> 3275.8390000000004
i got it worked out i got my conceptions

3274.079 --> 3278.799
worked out and

3275.839 --> 3281.68
the working out doesn't stop you see

3278.799 --> 3284.0
it's not like oh i have this idea

3281.68 --> 3286.799
and like a pga i'm just gonna

3284.0 --> 3289.599
no offense pj and i'm not gonna repeat

3286.799 --> 3292.72
it just the same sentence over and over

3289.599 --> 3295.839
again for like six years straight now i

3292.72 --> 3297.2
actually keep developing

3295.839 --> 3299.44
working out

3297.2 --> 3300.96
fine details and trying to figure out

3299.44 --> 3303.44
misconceptions

3300.96 --> 3305.839
wrong angle of approach things i had

3303.44 --> 3307.839
overlooked at first

3305.839 --> 3309.839
and keep on building

3307.839 --> 3313.04
on my

3309.839 --> 3315.2799999999997
theories my insights

3313.04 --> 3317.2
different angles of approach of parts of

3315.28 --> 3320.079
physical reality that everybody takes

3317.2 --> 3322.5589999999997
for granted are in a certain way and i

3320.079 --> 3323.8390000000004
see a misconception in that that's what

3322.559 --> 3326.3190000000004
i do

3323.839 --> 3328.319
and i'll never stop not as long as i

3326.319 --> 3330.5589999999997
live

3328.319 --> 3333.44
as long as i'm physically around i will

3330.559 --> 3333.44
keep doing that

3333.599 --> 3338.96
i feel sometimes i'm made

3336.079 --> 3342.7200000000003
for that specifically like that is my

3338.96 --> 3345.04
purpose of existence

3342.72 --> 3347.4399999999996
to do that because i can

3345.04 --> 3350.16
and because it's necessary

3347.44 --> 3352.559
because the world is just

3350.16 --> 3355.2
crumbling under the weight of all the

3352.559 --> 3358.3190000000004
delusion

3355.2 --> 3360.5589999999997
the problem is when that happens

3358.319 --> 3362.5589999999997
some of the delusion

3360.559 --> 3364.6400000000003
gets lost

3362.559 --> 3367.92
in the sense that everybody just starts

3364.64 --> 3369.839
assuming things and nobody knows it's

3367.92 --> 3372.799
actually wrong

3369.839 --> 3374.4
because it's just all buried under a

3372.799 --> 3376.48
pile of delusion and you're too

3374.4 --> 3378.559
preoccupied with the more short-term

3376.48 --> 3380.48
delusion that you have to deal with

3378.559 --> 3382.6400000000003
and then everything else becomes kind of

3380.48 --> 3385.44
vague and you just start echoing things

3382.64 --> 3388.0
you don't it erases

3385.44 --> 3392.319
your oversight over the past

3388.0 --> 3393.839
all the delusion and i'm here

3392.319 --> 3395.359
and i'm like

3393.839 --> 3398.64
just trying to

3395.359 --> 3400.4
clean it all up all of it all of it and

3398.64 --> 3401.5989999999997
it's a lot

3400.4 --> 3403.839
and

3401.599 --> 3405.839
i'm not going to be welcomed by people

3403.839 --> 3408.4
doing that

3405.839 --> 3410.48
there's going to be people that are

3408.4 --> 3412.64
for mysterious reasons going to be

3410.48 --> 3417.04
savagely triggered

3412.64 --> 3420.5589999999997
and they don't even understand why

3417.04 --> 3422.96
you see because it's that deeply buried

3420.559 --> 3424.559
some of these mistakes are like multiple

3422.96 --> 3426.7200000000003
generational

3424.559 --> 3430.6400000000003
where none in their family actually

3426.72 --> 3432.5589999999997
realized that it was a mistake

3430.64 --> 3434.16
it's all taken for granted and there's

3432.559 --> 3435.76
pride

3434.16 --> 3438.799
in the

3435.76 --> 3440.559
relaying of the mistake from generation

3438.799 --> 3443.04
to generation and how well it's worked

3440.559 --> 3444.88
out for them

3443.04 --> 3448.48
still a mistake

3444.88 --> 3452.4
and i'm here to set things straight

3448.48 --> 3452.4
even if that ruins people's moods

3456.079 --> 3458.8390000000004
my show yesterday is mirrored on super

3458.079 --> 3462.2400000000002
edge

3458.839 --> 3462.24
oh okay

3464.48 --> 3469.319
huh

3465.44 --> 3469.319
you have a link to that

3484.72 --> 3487.72
okay

3501.52 --> 3503.839
all right

3515.68 --> 3519.68
well that

3517.599 --> 3521.52
that would explain why i got

3519.68 --> 3524.0789999999997
an unusual amount of views on

3521.52 --> 3526.0
yesterday's show

3524.079 --> 3529.799
if it was mirrored then yeah they're

3526.0 --> 3529.799
gonna check it out

3537.52 --> 3544.28
but who's in control of his channel then

3540.16 --> 3544.2799999999997
who's uploading the new videos

3570.48 --> 3573.839
it's daughters okay

3580.4 --> 3584.44
i hope they're doing all right

3604.24 --> 3608.16
but i guess that's it's still a good

3606.48 --> 3609.68
thing because that means that youtube's

3608.16 --> 3613.96
not just gonna

3609.68 --> 3613.96
delete it straight away or something

3614.24 --> 3618.72
if they're picking up the rings

3616.799 --> 3620.319
at least like managing

3618.72 --> 3623.64
the legacy of it

3620.319 --> 3623.64
that's cool

3637.599 --> 3644.7200000000003
what's the most views i've ever seen

3640.16 --> 3647.92
close to no absolutely not even close no

3644.72 --> 3650.24
no steaming traveler

3647.92 --> 3652.48
i think that one of my biggest

3650.24 --> 3653.9199999999996
viewed videos

3652.48 --> 3656.88
was

3653.92 --> 3660.319
the mother of all bomb show

3656.88 --> 3660.319
when i had nathan oakley on

3661.68 --> 3665.68
i think it was still in my flat earth

3663.359 --> 3670.0
talks

3665.68 --> 3672.96
let me check it you can actually sort it

3670.0 --> 3672.96
most popular

3674.24 --> 3676.5589999999997
whoa

3678.72 --> 3681.68
no

3679.68 --> 3683.839
okay well it was at the

3681.68 --> 3687.44
damn

3683.839 --> 3692.16
earth early bird 135

3687.44 --> 3695.119
has 6.1 k viewers

3692.16 --> 3695.1189999999997
how did that happen

3697.52 --> 3701.92
an 82 second well that's not surprising

3700.64 --> 3702.8799999999997
that's when i

3701.92 --> 3706.4
yeah

3702.88 --> 3706.4
went full on berserk

3708.72 --> 3715.839
what happened at 1 35

3711.119 --> 3715.839
to had 6.1 k viewers

3721.839 --> 3729.319
right but yeah no not close to a million

3725.359 --> 3729.319
not even yeah close

3742.72 --> 3749.359
i'm really curious

3745.52 --> 3753.319
two years ago one three five what

3749.359 --> 3753.319
what was on that show

3756.079 --> 3759.079
okay

3772.079 --> 3777.96
i didn't seem to like go berserk or

3774.24 --> 3777.9599999999996
anything what

3787.119 --> 3790.44
i don't know

3799.52 --> 3805.0389999999998
hello dx i'm gonna take

3802.24 --> 3805.0389999999998
two minute break

3808.24 --> 3811.72
be right back

3878.079 --> 3881.079
so

3896.62 --> 3899.69
[Music]

3916.88 --> 3922.6400000000003
yeah you're an idiot in a troll get out

3919.76 --> 3926.7200000000003
of here

3922.64 --> 3926.72
this is like mike fox again or something

3930.4 --> 3937.2000000000003
dude it's 2021 it's no longer 2015. it

3934.16 --> 3940.799
doesn't work anymore all that stuff is

3937.2 --> 3943.7599999999998
out there it's really easy

3940.799 --> 3946.4
people literally do it constantly

3943.76 --> 3948.88
constantly it's a

3946.4 --> 3952.319
weekly event

3948.88 --> 3954.2400000000002
we've kind of moved past that

3952.319 --> 3957.359
ship being brought back from over the

3954.24 --> 3959.4399999999996
horizon when you zoom in yeah or we just

3957.359 --> 3961.119
have the black swan observations that

3959.44 --> 3964.319
prove

3961.119 --> 3969.359
beyond a reasonable doubt that the

3964.319 --> 3971.359
horizon is not the geometry of a sphere

3969.359 --> 3973.0389999999998
because you can see too far

3971.359 --> 3975.2799999999997
without that

3973.039 --> 3978.76
presupposed geometry blocking the

3975.28 --> 3978.76
viewing distance

3982.64 --> 3985.96
what's that

3989.55 --> 3995.319
[Music]

3992.319 --> 3995.319
oh

4012.64 --> 4017.7599999999998
yeah pj khrushchev but that's normal

4015.2 --> 4020.16
though it's a systemic issue it's just

4017.76 --> 4021.76
it's actually beyond an issue and it's

4020.16 --> 4024.96
just a tactic

4021.76 --> 4027.76
amnesia tactic back to square one

4024.96 --> 4029.359
is the standard approach

4027.76 --> 4034.079
ignore

4029.359 --> 4036.64
rinse repeat ignore rinse repeat

4034.079 --> 4039.92
it's you could you could call it the

4036.64 --> 4039.92
great numpty reset

4041.359 --> 4045.92
right it's

4042.72 --> 4047.68
they reset to default numpty mode again

4045.92 --> 4050.88
so they start over again with the

4047.68 --> 4054.0789999999997
original stupid arguments

4050.88 --> 4057.319
which have been moved past a long long

4054.079 --> 4057.319
time ago

4084.64 --> 4087.64
huh

4089.01 --> 4092.1490000000003
[Music]

4093.68 --> 4096.68
hmm

4141.44 --> 4148.799
yeah yeah the great dumpty reset

4144.88 --> 4153.0
i know that's what my show was called

4148.799 --> 4153.0
was it three days ago

4186.319 --> 4189.319
hmm

4189.52 --> 4196.4400000000005
i really wonder why my [ __ ] i'm puzzled

4192.239 --> 4198.879999999999
now why does flat earth early bird life

4196.44 --> 4199.639999999999
135 episode

4198.88 --> 4201.1990000000005
have

4199.64 --> 4204.64
7.1

4201.199 --> 4207.599999999999
k views i don't understand

4204.64 --> 4210.2390000000005
like that's new to me why did this this

4207.6 --> 4213.8
draw in so much attention recently

4210.239 --> 4213.799999999999
how did that happen

4218.08 --> 4225.48
like it doesn't even have a title

4221.92 --> 4225.4800000000005
i'm really surprised

4241.199 --> 4244.199
yep

4246.59 --> 4252.249
[Music]

4254.96 --> 4257.96
uh

4293.52 --> 4300.56
right so i got 45 minutes

4297.28 --> 4302.5599999999995
i mean what am i saying i got 15 more

4300.56 --> 4305.04
minutes

4302.56 --> 4306.96
if i'm gonna round out

4305.04 --> 4309.04
10 or so

4306.96 --> 4312.04
trying to figure out something to

4309.04 --> 4312.04
address

4380.64 --> 4384.08
huh

4381.52 --> 4386.2390000000005
and look at their salary of course this

4384.08 --> 4388.48
salary hey if you go along with lies

4386.239 --> 4392.4
you're going to get a good salary

4388.48 --> 4392.4
i mean it's only costing your soul

4392.719 --> 4396.96
that's it you know

4394.48 --> 4399.678999999999
if you're willing to give up your

4396.96 --> 4402.2390000000005
soul then yeah you can get all the money

4399.679 --> 4402.2390000000005
in the world

4403.36 --> 4408.04
because now you're nice and malleable

4412.159 --> 4416.719
very easy

4413.679 --> 4418.56
to program

4416.719 --> 4420.719
that's worth the investment isn't it

4418.56 --> 4423.4400000000005
it's like oh yeah you're not being paid

4420.719 --> 4425.76
for your skills you're being paid to be

4423.44 --> 4426.639999999999
programmable have you ever considered

4425.76 --> 4429.12
that

4426.64 --> 4431.52
professor phil bell yeah

4429.12 --> 4433.599999999999
why they get paid so well

4431.52 --> 4436.88
not because they're actually good at

4433.6 --> 4438.88
what they do but because of their format

4436.88 --> 4443.12
because the way they are and conduct

4438.88 --> 4443.12
themselves they're programmable

4443.28 --> 4447.5199999999995
the value is invested in the

4445.52 --> 4451.1990000000005
programmability

4447.52 --> 4451.1990000000005
not the actual skills

4452.8 --> 4458.360000000001
what to nonsense

4454.4 --> 4458.36
keep telling yourself that

4475.44 --> 4480.799999999999
right all that money

4477.76 --> 4486.159000000001
is conditional

4480.8 --> 4486.159000000001
it's just not directly in the contract

4486.48 --> 4490.48
it's

4488.159 --> 4492.08
guaranteed because of programming it

4490.48 --> 4494.4
doesn't have to be signed under a

4492.08 --> 4497.04
contract it's the programming that's

4494.4 --> 4501.04
gonna be the guarantee the programming

4497.04 --> 4503.44
is the investment the programming is the

4501.04 --> 4504.56
investment

4503.44 --> 4507.36
they pay

4504.56 --> 4509.6
because you have the programming

4507.36 --> 4511.759999999999
that makes you predictable

4509.6 --> 4514.88
that makes your growth arc into the

4511.76 --> 4517.1990000000005
future predictable

4514.88 --> 4519.4400000000005
easy to utilize

4517.199 --> 4521.5199999999995
without you

4519.44 --> 4524.4
knowing it

4521.52 --> 4527.280000000001
and that shutter you virtually have in

4524.4 --> 4531.28
front of your eyes for future events

4527.28 --> 4532.4
is what you're being paid for

4531.28 --> 4534.719
right

4532.4 --> 4536.879999999999
because if you were in the know

4534.719 --> 4538.96
then you would point out the fallacies

4536.88 --> 4541.92
the wrongness and you would get in the

4538.96 --> 4544.32
way of progression what they want then

4541.92 --> 4546.08
you're gonna not get as much money so

4544.32 --> 4548.719
yeah they really don't see oh wow this

4546.08 --> 4550.88
guy's really programmable he's gonna be

4548.719 --> 4553.12
a good asset in the future

4550.88 --> 4554.8
so let's give him a big salary keep him

4553.12 --> 4557.84
all satisfied

4554.8 --> 4558.88
and then future will get back to you

4557.84 --> 4563.96
yeah

4558.88 --> 4563.96
that's where you're at and you know it

4581.28 --> 4586.5599999999995
yeah yeah just be a tool right just be

4584.56 --> 4589.04
the wrench don't

4586.56 --> 4591.120000000001
don't get into the design don't spot

4589.04 --> 4595.12
flaws

4591.12 --> 4598.0
just work with the programming right

4595.12 --> 4600.08
understand it the way you are taught to

4598.0 --> 4602.48
understand it not naturally don't

4600.08 --> 4603.6
actually try to figure things out

4602.48 --> 4604.32
just

4603.6 --> 4606.08
be

4604.32 --> 4609.84
the tool

4606.08 --> 4609.84
i know professor phil bell

4617.44 --> 4621.639999999999
it's really oh [ __ ] off

4624.8 --> 4629.64
you don't know what the state of this

4626.159 --> 4629.639999999999
building is anyway

4654.48 --> 4659.5199999999995
so as i run my own business who programs

4658.0 --> 4661.679
me

4659.52 --> 4662.719
you do

4661.679 --> 4665.28
because

4662.719 --> 4667.76
the foundation for your programming has

4665.28 --> 4668.88
already been inserted

4667.76 --> 4670.8
you see

4668.88 --> 4673.04
now after that point you're just going

4670.8 --> 4674.56
to be reinforcing your own programming

4673.04 --> 4677.12
paul archer

4674.56 --> 4680.56
that's how it works

4677.12 --> 4682.08
oh you you don't like the idea of that

4680.56 --> 4684.88
do you

4682.08 --> 4684.88
it's what it is

4685.36 --> 4690.639999999999
right i've known people that were

4688.48 --> 4693.599999999999
that still are engineers

4690.64 --> 4695.6
that i got in serious trouble because

4693.6 --> 4698.08
they were active

4695.6 --> 4700.4800000000005
and they were researching they were like

4698.08 --> 4702.32
i am going to figure these things out

4700.48 --> 4703.5199999999995
that are not figured out and i know how

4702.32 --> 4705.84
to do it

4703.52 --> 4708.0
and i got a whole bunch of interesting

4705.84 --> 4709.76
conversations mechanical conversations

4708.0 --> 4711.84
with that guy

4709.76 --> 4715.679
none of them on record it's like 10

4711.84 --> 4715.679
years ago literally 10 years ago

4715.92 --> 4719.1990000000005
until

4717.84 --> 4721.76
yeah

4719.199 --> 4724.639999999999
he kind of had to make the move because

4721.76 --> 4726.08
he figured out flat earth he literally

4724.64 --> 4728.64
figured it out through physics

4726.08 --> 4731.5199999999995
completely by himself not any flat earth

4728.64 --> 4734.88
awakening no he figured it out and then

4731.52 --> 4737.040000000001
he realized the price he realized that

4734.88 --> 4739.52
he was gonna get nagged over that if he

4737.04 --> 4740.8
was gonna get get and stay official

4739.52 --> 4743.1990000000005
about it

4740.8 --> 4746.56
and probably get his own like his kid in

4743.199 --> 4749.839999999999
trouble they literally threatened

4746.56 --> 4752.159000000001
to like steal his kid i think not 100

4749.84 --> 4752.159000000001
sure

4752.32 --> 4756.719
but he he stepped back

4754.719 --> 4758.96
that's what happened

4756.719 --> 4758.96
right

4760.08 --> 4765.28
because if you are actually figuring it

4763.44 --> 4767.599999999999
out as an engineer

4765.28 --> 4770.8
you're going to bump into the

4767.6 --> 4772.56
blatant obstacles that are systemically

4770.8 --> 4775.28
inserted there

4772.56 --> 4777.360000000001
to not be overcome because when you get

4775.28 --> 4780.0
over those obstacles when you start to

4777.36 --> 4782.159
fix it as someone as a true

4780.0 --> 4783.28
brilliant guy that really knows what's

4782.159 --> 4785.92
going on

4783.28 --> 4787.5199999999995
you're going to get attacked

4785.92 --> 4789.76
you're going to be called crazy you're

4787.52 --> 4792.96
going to be slandered you're going to be

4789.76 --> 4794.64
politically burdened from all sides

4792.96 --> 4796.64
if you're successful that's what

4794.64 --> 4798.88
happened that's what happened i

4796.64 --> 4800.159000000001
witnessed it and it wasn't even a flat

4798.88 --> 4801.12
earther yet

4800.159 --> 4803.92
yeah

4801.12 --> 4807.76
i witnessed that happening i witnessed

4803.92 --> 4810.8
somebody crumble under the pressure

4807.76 --> 4810.8
from society

4813.44 --> 4819.5199999999995
it it really sent me off into like

4817.36 --> 4821.839999999999
disappointed confusion because he was

4819.52 --> 4824.2390000000005
like the only flat earth

4821.84 --> 4826.639
friend that i knew back then to be able

4824.239 --> 4828.718999999999
to develop these ideas with and then he

4826.639 --> 4831.04
quit he literally i don't want to talk

4828.719 --> 4833.52
about it ever again

4831.04 --> 4835.36
[ __ ] and then suddenly it was just me

4833.52 --> 4836.76
again and i forgot about it and then the

4835.36 --> 4839.44
flat earth

4836.76 --> 4841.360000000001
2015 awakening happened and then

4839.44 --> 4844.678999999999
suddenly

4841.36 --> 4844.679
i'd reconnected

4846.08 --> 4851.92
i had other people online to communicate

4849.04 --> 4851.92
about it with now

4853.6 --> 4858.04
where before it was kind of secret

4864.96 --> 4869.04
so we're all oh so oh

4867.36 --> 4871.5199999999995
oh yeah

4869.04 --> 4874.0
yeah paul oh yeah i'm gonna tell you

4871.52 --> 4876.2390000000005
exactly who they are so you could try to

4874.0 --> 4879.12
get them fired after all is that what

4876.239 --> 4881.04
you were gonna do that sort of [ __ ]

4879.12 --> 4884.08
yeah yeah you think i'm going to

4881.04 --> 4887.44
actually reveal details about people

4884.08 --> 4887.44
from my past to you

4887.52 --> 4892.400000000001
creepy ass gammas there's no chance in

4891.52 --> 4893.360000000001
hell

4892.4 --> 4895.36
okay

4893.36 --> 4896.5599999999995
no chance in hell that's ever gonna

4895.36 --> 4899.36
happen

4896.56 --> 4900.400000000001
it's none of your [ __ ] business you

4899.36 --> 4902.48
understand

4900.4 --> 4906.12
it's none of your [ __ ] business who

4902.48 --> 4906.12
those people are

4922.56 --> 4926.320000000001
get the [ __ ] out of here scum

4926.719 --> 4932.4
go do your sickening little gamma

4929.36 --> 4937.28
fishing on who to attack and ruin their

4932.4 --> 4937.28
lives next go and do that somewhere else

4952.96 --> 4959.84
i wonder if these people even realize

4954.96 --> 4962.32
that they're technically like communists

4959.84 --> 4964.2390000000005
these numpties operate like unwitting

4962.32 --> 4966.4
soviet agents

4964.239 --> 4969.839999999999
they don't even know it

4966.4 --> 4969.839999999999
never tried to compare that

4970.8 --> 4975.84
they don't even know it

4973.199 --> 4977.839999999999
like did you know that like constantly

4975.84 --> 4978.719
trying to rat out

4977.84 --> 4981.92
people

4978.719 --> 4983.84
that dare think outside of the system

4981.92 --> 4985.52
official story

4983.84 --> 4987.4400000000005
with holes in it

4985.52 --> 4991.76
that you refuse to wreck did you know

4987.44 --> 4994.32
that that is exactly what soviet

4991.76 --> 4996.56
agents and spies do

4994.32 --> 4998.32
did you know you were a soviet agent

4996.56 --> 5001.4400000000005
paul archer

4998.32 --> 5003.84
did you know that

5001.44 --> 5006.159
probably never been like a conscious

5003.84 --> 5008.719
decision to do that it's just the thing

5006.159 --> 5011.12
to do now right nobody's stopping you oh

5008.719 --> 5012.0
you're getting paid so well

5011.12 --> 5015.48
yeah

5012.0 --> 5015.48
yeah we know

5018.8 --> 5022.2390000000005
hello

5019.92 --> 5022.2390000000005
yeah

5023.92 --> 5029.84
government created crime pays i know

5030.159 --> 5034.32
especially when you can't really even

5032.639 --> 5036.719
prove it it's crime but it's still

5034.32 --> 5039.04
effective like crime

5036.719 --> 5042.84
to tear down opponents to tear down

5039.04 --> 5042.84
people that want freedom

5043.12 --> 5046.5599999999995
so they just do it like this and now

5044.88 --> 5048.56
you're unwitting

5046.56 --> 5051.120000000001
soviet agents

5048.56 --> 5051.120000000001
aren't you

5053.199 --> 5056.799999999999
let's figure out who the wrong thinkers

5055.76 --> 5059.1990000000005
are

5056.8 --> 5061.1990000000005
oh can you tell me who they are oh i

5059.199 --> 5063.36
don't think they really exist i don't

5061.199 --> 5065.5199999999995
think people really exist out there that

5063.36 --> 5068.239
are engineers

5065.52 --> 5070.159000000001
that think that the earth is flat

5068.239 --> 5072.239
from their own natural conclusions that

5070.159 --> 5074.719
got into trouble that got threatened why

5072.239 --> 5077.759999999999
don't you tell us his name yeah that's

5074.719 --> 5079.12
not gonna work work soviet spy that's

5077.76 --> 5082.12
not gonna work

5079.12 --> 5082.12
see

5085.44 --> 5089.839999999999
all right i'm gonna round out the show

5086.88 --> 5092.400000000001
before this gets any worse

5089.84 --> 5094.0
but yeah i think

5092.4 --> 5096.719
comparing

5094.0 --> 5099.92
some of these people to

5096.719 --> 5102.56
soviet agents is actually quite a good

5099.92 --> 5102.56
comparison

5103.92 --> 5106.32
isn't it

5106.4 --> 5110.638999999999
isn't it

5107.92 --> 5110.639
i think it is

5111.36 --> 5117.36
it's just that they don't even know it

5114.88 --> 5119.84
which is kind of even creepier like oh
