finally completely getting any crypto

88.32 --> 92.079
walls out of that routine

90.079 --> 93.91999999999999
uh

92.079 --> 96.079
yeah

93.92 --> 99.2
today the weather is

96.079 --> 99.19999999999999
completely different

99.759 --> 104.07900000000001
it actually rained a bit in the morning

103.36 --> 107.84
but

104.079 --> 107.83999999999999
yeah it's gotten all clouded

108.159 --> 111.28
and kind of cold

112.079 --> 115.55999999999999
so yeah

119.68 --> 124.64
i guess that uh what is it now four

122.479 --> 126.88
four days with great

124.64 --> 129.28
clear skies sunny

126.88 --> 131.51999999999998
was enough for a while so now it's just

129.28 --> 134.319
clouded like this

131.52 --> 134.31900000000002
big gray soup

137.68 --> 140.0
all right

140.64 --> 145.67999999999998
i sure do hope the good weather will be

143.04 --> 145.67999999999998
back soon

145.84 --> 148.239
anyway

154.8 --> 160.92000000000002
it is sunday the 20th of march 2022.

167.519 --> 171.8
nobody in chat just yet

172.8 --> 177.36
right

174.959 --> 177.36
anyway

179.2 --> 184.56
i had a very good rest this night it

181.599 --> 186.48
went to bed early this time for my doing

184.56 --> 190.48
that is

186.48 --> 192.72
and yeah that that was very helpful

190.48 --> 195.2
i've been sleeping like very heavy

192.72 --> 196.959
recently i don't know why exactly might

195.2 --> 198.72
have something to do with like this

196.959 --> 200.239
strain of cannabis that i've been

198.72 --> 201.76
smoking

200.239 --> 204.799
it's weird

201.76 --> 208.72
i think it's stronger than the what i'm

204.799 --> 208.72
typically used to with the others but

209.76 --> 212.64
yeah

210.64 --> 213.51899999999998
does make it cheaper though because it

212.64 --> 216.23899999999998
just

213.519 --> 218.159
it lasts a lot longer i don't just go

216.239 --> 220.64000000000001
smoking smoke and smoking

218.159 --> 223.28
because that's pricey

220.64 --> 226.0
but yeah it's it does have like a pretty

223.28 --> 228.799
weird impact

226.0 --> 230.48
makes me sleep like deeper

228.799 --> 233.28
then when i wake up in the morning it's

230.48 --> 235.2
like really almost like my body's gone

233.28 --> 236.4
like just woke up out of a coma or

235.2 --> 238.48
something like

236.4 --> 240.4
you feel all your muscles everywhere

238.48 --> 243.35999999999999
really deep sleep so but i guess it's

240.4 --> 246.799
useful it's been good for my jaw my jaw

243.36 --> 246.799
today is like really good

247.04 --> 249.28
like

249.439 --> 251.76
yeah

252.72 --> 257.28
hello one big pond first in chat good

254.879 --> 257.28
seal

264.0 --> 268.84
let's check the temperature right now

270.24 --> 275.12
hmm eight degrees

272.72 --> 275.12
yak

276.639 --> 280.96000000000004
and it does say rainy too so

281.68 --> 286.24
although according to the predictions

284.0 --> 288.639
here it should be getting a lot warmer

286.24 --> 292.639
tomorrow

288.639 --> 292.639
just tuesday 90 degrees

292.8 --> 296.479
well that

294.08 --> 300.479
sure sounds nice

296.479 --> 300.479
but yeah right now it's kind of like

302.56 --> 304.88
anyway

307.68 --> 310.56
i watched back

309.039 --> 312.4
yesterday's show

310.56 --> 315.199
most of it pretty much up until the

312.4 --> 317.039
point that i started to drag in

315.199 --> 319.039
like my old sketches

317.039 --> 321.59999999999997
then i kind of like got wandered uh

319.039 --> 323.28
wandered off

321.6 --> 326.32000000000005
watching other things

323.28 --> 326.32
it was a good show

333.12 --> 337.4
okay thank you one big pond

340.88 --> 343.199
hmm

343.36 --> 349.039
right

344.24 --> 349.039
but uh yeah that was a really fun video

349.44 --> 353.08
from michael khan

355.44 --> 357.84
let's see

363.12 --> 367.84000000000003
from roughly an hour ago hilarious

369.759 --> 373.199
but fight the flat earth it's just it's

372.24 --> 376.96000000000004
just a

373.199 --> 379.68
silly little video but it is hilarious

376.96 --> 382.4
it's almost as hilarious as jim bob's

379.68 --> 384.16
upload from

382.4 --> 386.23999999999995
when was it

384.16 --> 389.44
yeah from yesterday

386.24 --> 391.6
don pettit is a beast that video i don't

389.44 --> 395.12
know if i shared that already yesterday

391.6 --> 399.12
i'm not sure when it popped up but god

395.12 --> 401.759
that was so freaking hilarious

399.12 --> 404.639
like you gotta watch that you're gonna

401.759 --> 404.639
be in space

404.96 --> 410.79999999999995
jim bob is so nailing this guy it's it's

408.0 --> 410.8
unbelievable

410.88 --> 415.36
it's a it's a really short video too so

413.039 --> 417.44
you could just watch it

415.36 --> 421.039
it's like one minute

417.44 --> 423.12
just watch it and then get back at me

421.039 --> 424.96
it's so freaking funny

423.12 --> 426.96
i played but it's like jim bob's

424.96 --> 428.479
creation i don't want to

426.96 --> 430.88
do that

428.479 --> 434.28
unless he gives me specific permission

430.88 --> 434.28
to do that

437.68 --> 442.16
i mean i would love to be able to play

439.759 --> 445.039
some of his skits on my show not all of

442.16 --> 448.03900000000004
them but just some of them are just so

445.039 --> 448.039
good

450.4 --> 458.12
and this is one of those

453.12 --> 458.12
hello psych bear good to see you

473.039 --> 479.56
ah let's see what else

475.599 --> 483.589
what else what else what else

479.56 --> 483.589
[Music]

488.16 --> 492.68
yeah things were relatively uneventful

494.96 --> 501.039
oh yeah and then it started to go to

496.8 --> 502.40000000000003
netflix and watch like a series

501.039 --> 505.4
but it's

502.4 --> 505.4
ugh

509.84 --> 514.7189999999999
lost in space

512.08 --> 514.719
and it is

515.519 --> 519.519
it's

516.8 --> 521.3599999999999
there's like some little little thingies

519.519 --> 522.719
that are kind of cool

521.36 --> 525.04
and there's a whole bunch of things that

522.719 --> 528.5600000000001
are like oh my god no

525.04 --> 531.1999999999999
don't do that it's so annoying

528.56 --> 533.4399999999999
it's so

531.2 --> 536.48
so annoying

533.44 --> 538.72
god like the whole series is is really

536.48 --> 540.24
freaking boring as [ __ ]

538.72 --> 542.08
and there's like all this sensitive

540.24 --> 544.64
little family moments that are just

542.08 --> 545.76
completely out of place and wouldn't

544.64 --> 546.56
it's just

545.76 --> 549.8389999999999
no

546.56 --> 549.8389999999999
just no

550.0 --> 554.399
and that stupid meme

552.56 --> 557.1999999999999
with the robot

554.399 --> 559.88
that basically says only

557.2 --> 561.76
danger will robinson it's so

559.88 --> 562.399
annoying

561.76 --> 565.76
like

562.399 --> 568.64
really freaking strangle you annoying

565.76 --> 569.6
like shut the [ __ ] up who green light at

568.64 --> 571.8389999999999
that

569.6 --> 574.16
who the [ __ ] green light that's the

571.839 --> 578.9590000000001
dumbest [ __ ] thing ever

574.16 --> 582.16
you idiot that's not nostalgic it's just

578.959 --> 583.279
really [ __ ] annoying

582.16 --> 585.6
god

583.279 --> 588.16
ugh so don't watch that series it's

585.6 --> 588.16
stupid

588.839 --> 592.6400000000001
yeah anyway

595.839 --> 600.24
although it does have kind of like a

598.24 --> 603.24
couple of good moments it's just like

600.24 --> 603.24
dude

605.76 --> 609.92
i think that the entire thing has a

607.839 --> 611.6800000000001
potential to be

609.92 --> 614.399
re-edited

611.68 --> 616.4799999999999
probably like trim with third out and

614.399 --> 617.76
then it could be like halfway these in

616.48 --> 619.519
the series

617.76 --> 621.519
they just

619.519 --> 624.88
left the garbage out

621.519 --> 627.68
right kind of like the the phantom edit

624.88 --> 630.32
with with star wars the

627.68 --> 632.959
the prick the origin the first prequel

630.32 --> 635.12
which is in everybody's memory extremely

632.959 --> 638.0
annoying because of some certain

635.12 --> 638.8
characters but not just that

638.0 --> 641.839
well

638.8 --> 644.3199999999999
there were people fans that literally

641.839 --> 647.12
just outside of

644.32 --> 649.36
the group just i made an edit of that

647.12 --> 650.48
cut all the garbage out shorten things

649.36 --> 653.12
up

650.48 --> 655.519
and that is a great movie and i mean it

653.12 --> 658.88
like the phantom edit is a great movie

655.519 --> 661.839
it is and it fits in between

658.88 --> 664.56
just star wars it's just the [ __ ]

661.839 --> 667.2790000000001
stupid sound effects and really

664.56 --> 669.04
pointless annoying scene our scenes are

667.279 --> 671.6
out of there and it's pretty cool that

669.04 --> 674.48
way right they should do that to that

671.6 --> 675.76
series not that anybody gives a [ __ ] if

674.48 --> 678.64
they did that

675.76 --> 680.88
it would be so much better

678.64 --> 683.92
because it does have like

680.88 --> 687.4399999999999
potential it just is it just feels like

683.92 --> 690.56
so much is squandered in there and

687.44 --> 692.8800000000001
uh the antagonist character is so

690.56 --> 694.16
annoying

692.88 --> 695.68
it's like it's

694.16 --> 698.64
directed

695.68 --> 701.76
like it's social commentary on like an

698.64 --> 704.3199999999999
eight-year-old level but like not in

701.76 --> 707.04
nostalgia of eight-year-olds but like

704.32 --> 708.72
really directed towards eight-year-olds

707.04 --> 711.4399999999999
i don't know what the [ __ ] is wrong with

708.72 --> 711.44
that series

711.76 --> 715.8389999999999
ugh

713.76 --> 717.6
i wish i watched like two episodes and

715.839 --> 719.9200000000001
then it just

717.6 --> 724.5600000000001
went to bed yeah

719.92 --> 724.56
it was so boring i went to bed early

725.04 --> 728.079
right enough about

728.839 --> 734.8800000000001
that yeah

731.279 --> 738.32
yeah psych bear it's great isn't it

734.88 --> 741.12
i love that his commentary like

738.32 --> 741.12
the last part

742.639 --> 746.48
like

744.32 --> 748.88
like in space

746.48 --> 750.88
you have to move really quickly i can't

748.88 --> 753.04
do it like he does but it's just the way

750.88 --> 754.48
to move really quickly so we have to

753.04 --> 756.48
train

754.48 --> 758.72
in a swimming pool where it's exactly

756.48 --> 762.5600000000001
the opposite but it kind of looks the

758.72 --> 762.5600000000001
same and that's really good

764.0 --> 768.88
it's so

765.2 --> 772.36
it's just well done kim bob well done

768.88 --> 772.36
you get it

781.12 --> 786.6

790.639 --> 796.32

793.519 --> 798.16
maybe now that all the sun is gone

796.32 --> 799.6800000000001

798.16 --> 802.24
basements

799.68 --> 802.2399999999999

804.32 --> 807.279

1047.36 --> 1050.9599999999998
a whole bunch and not like direct food

1049.44 --> 1053.039
but just like

1050.96 --> 1054.96
things that are still involved well like

1053.039 --> 1056.32
olive oil

1054.96 --> 1058.08
and

1056.32 --> 1060.08

so i'm really glad with the donation

1060.08 --> 1064.799

1062.96 --> 1069.2
because i was almost get it yeah i was

1064.799 --> 1069.2
gonna be broke again i'm sorry it's just

1070.16 --> 1075.039
but at least i'm now able to eat

1072.48 --> 1077.039
probably until like

1075.039 --> 1081.32
the rest the

1077.039 --> 1081.32
monthly money comes in

1092.72 --> 1099.3600000000001
four hours cooking wow dude that's

1096.32 --> 1102.36
that's quite a wow

1099.36 --> 1102.36
huh

1111.919 --> 1116.5590000000002
still have this plan that i wanna yeah

1114.88 --> 1118.0
which is not really working out in the

1116.559 --> 1120.24
weekend unless she's gonna stay in the

1118.0 --> 1121.2
weekend but my roommate the really cute

1120.24 --> 1122.96
one

1121.2 --> 1126.0800000000002
i want to like make

1122.96 --> 1127.679
my old-fashioned spaghetti

1126.08 --> 1130.24
and because i haven't really done that

1127.679 --> 1132.72
in a long time because it's so much work

1130.24 --> 1136.48
and then i end up like having to eat

1132.72 --> 1138.4
that for three or four days in a row

1136.48 --> 1139.52
and then i don't

1138.4 --> 1141.6000000000001
yeah

1139.52 --> 1143.6
it's just so much better when i make

1141.6 --> 1145.84
that when i can share it with somebody

1143.6 --> 1149.76
so that i don't have to keep eating it

1145.84 --> 1151.84
and then the quality goes down over time

1149.76 --> 1154.0
i want to do that but it does kind of

1151.84 --> 1156.48
take an investment of like at least 20

1154.0 --> 1156.48
euros

1156.559 --> 1159.2
maybe more

1159.44 --> 1162.64
no goat ownership

1182.32 --> 1185.9189999999999
by the way i think like

1186.0 --> 1191.6
anybody noticed owen benjamin recently

1188.88 --> 1192.48
i guess he's now like

1191.6 --> 1195.1999999999998
well

1192.48 --> 1197.679
trolling but not really

1195.2 --> 1200.48
and he's gone in full in putin and i

1197.679 --> 1201.679
really like it

1200.48 --> 1204.0
because

1201.679 --> 1204.0
yeah

1204.88 --> 1211.679
any person with like

1207.76 --> 1214.96
a moral sense and half a brain

1211.679 --> 1216.96
should be doing that really

1214.96 --> 1218.24
and i think it's really

1216.96 --> 1220.64
funny

1218.24 --> 1223.2
and like i think it's cool that he's not

1220.64 --> 1225.039
not having it anymore he's just like

1223.2 --> 1227.28
yeah

1225.039 --> 1230.72
i'm gonna screw with you now you

1227.28 --> 1230.72
brainwashed idiots

1233.28 --> 1237.9189999999999

1234.72 --> 1240.559
like i need that needs to be done like

1237.919 --> 1242.7990000000002
basically the

1240.559 --> 1244.559
the people that aren't going with like

1242.799 --> 1247.28
mainstream media brainwashing beast

1244.559 --> 1250.1589999999999
system they just we all need we need to

1247.28 --> 1252.559

and that's not saruman

1259.039 --> 1264.0
saying that about sarah that's just

1261.52 --> 1267.12
freaking common sense

1264.0 --> 1267.12
who's in the right here

1268.0 --> 1273.28
and like what's

1269.919 --> 1273.2800000000002
what's even really happening

1275.12 --> 1281.32
so i'm gonna try to add to that joke we

1277.44 --> 1281.3200000000002
need to join putin

1292.0 --> 1296.88
it's time to lay down the gay

1295.28 --> 1298.8799999999999
for good

1296.88 --> 1303.0800000000002
we need to put the gay back into the

1298.88 --> 1303.0800000000002
closet and join putin

1304.4 --> 1308.2800000000002
it is your destiny

1329.2 --> 1334.4
casual relations what does that mean

1335.6 --> 1340.12
serious what does that mean aries 106

1348.88 --> 1352.159
yeah as far as i know

1350.96 --> 1354.559
like

1352.159 --> 1358.159
roommate still has a boyfriend

1354.559 --> 1363.9189999999999
boyfriend seem kind of a cool guy

1358.159 --> 1363.919
yeah i i am not like i'm monogamous

1364.72 --> 1371.44
yeah pretty damn sure she's aware that i

1368.159 --> 1372.64
think she's incredibly cute

1371.44 --> 1375.44
like

1372.64 --> 1378.159
she has senses she picks that up about

1375.44 --> 1380.64
me and i'm just being very honorable

1378.159 --> 1384.4
very modest

1380.64 --> 1384.4
not being like grudgy

1384.88 --> 1387.919
but

1385.6 --> 1390.24
she has a boyfriend and yeah i'm kind of

1387.919 --> 1391.44
waiting for that guy to completely screw

1390.24 --> 1393.52
up

1391.44 --> 1395.3600000000001
not that i really hope he does that but

1393.52 --> 1397.52
like if he's gonna do that then i'm

1395.36 --> 1398.8799999999999
gonna be right here

1397.52 --> 1401.039
and that's it

1398.88 --> 1403.8400000000001
and it might never happen and that won't

1401.039 --> 1403.84
change my attitude

1404.4 --> 1406.64
right

1407.76 --> 1412.72
but i'm not gonna touch her

1410.4 --> 1412.72
that's

1413.12 --> 1418.9599999999998
that's a grave offense

1415.12 --> 1422.32
in yeah for a question that's like

1418.96 --> 1425.2
absolutely no no terrain

1422.32 --> 1425.2
you don't do that

1429.12 --> 1434.2399999999998
i technically don't even want to disturb

1431.36 --> 1434.24
their relationship

1435.279 --> 1437.52
right

1437.679 --> 1441.3600000000001
they're in the same age category

1441.44 --> 1443.8400000000001
i'm not

1442.559 --> 1446.32
like

1443.84 --> 1449.4399999999998
if i ever like get anything out of it

1446.32 --> 1451.279
that's just lucky that's just god

1449.44 --> 1452.96
saying like okay

1451.279 --> 1456.0
all right

1452.96 --> 1458.64
here's a bonus but yeah that's not

1456.0 --> 1460.48
something that's my right to claim or

1458.64 --> 1462.4
something right no matter how much i

1460.48 --> 1463.919
like to be dominant

1462.4 --> 1466.5590000000002
no

1463.919 --> 1468.96
it's a matter of honor

1466.559 --> 1468.96
anyway

1469.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
getting a bit carried away here

1470.96 --> 1473.8400000000001
springtime and all

1485.76 --> 1489.84
you don't think youtube will let you

1487.36 --> 1492.6399999999999
talk about that kind of stuff you'd be

1489.84 --> 1493.76
surprised but yeah maybe

1492.64 --> 1495.44
maybe

1493.76 --> 1499.12
don't

1495.44 --> 1504.64
use spring to start watching porn

1499.12 --> 1504.6399999999999
or adjacent right don't don't be

1504.88 --> 1508.7990000000002
don't be seduced to start squirting just

1507.2 --> 1511.6000000000001
because spring is in the air it's not

1508.799 --> 1514.8799999999999
good that's not a good thing to do

1511.6 --> 1517.52
just internalize it

1514.88 --> 1521.159
like store it

1517.52 --> 1521.1589999999999
for a later use

1533.2 --> 1536.2
poutine

1552.13 --> 1556.0590000000002
[Applause]

1564.62 --> 1572.2489999999998
[Applause]

1591.679 --> 1596.1200000000001

1606.32 --> 1610.559
benjamin man

1608.4 --> 1613.039
the catholic inquisition which i thought

1610.559 --> 1614.6399999999999
is kind of funny

1613.039 --> 1616.72
i thought it was kind of funny that he

1614.64 --> 1620.0800000000002
chose that title

1616.72 --> 1620.08
and that was thursday

1622.24 --> 1626.4
the 17th

1624.72 --> 1629.679
now let me look

1626.4 --> 1633.039
what my show what called

1629.679 --> 1633.039
thursday the 17th

1638.799 --> 1644.399
it's now sunday thursday would have been

1641.52 --> 1647.44
the 17th three days ago

1644.399 --> 1649.36
yeah five days ago i had my it's time

1647.44 --> 1650.72
for an inquisition title i just thought

1649.36 --> 1653.039
it was like

1650.72 --> 1653.039
huh

1653.36 --> 1657.1999999999998
was i just being early or did somebody

1656.0 --> 1659.679
actually

1657.2 --> 1661.76
catch on to that title

1659.679 --> 1665.1200000000001
that i did it's

1661.76 --> 1665.12
just one of those little things

1665.6 --> 1669.84
10

1667.039 --> 1669.84
10 what

1670.64 --> 1674.72
what

1672.88 --> 1678.0800000000002
oh wait that's a

1674.72 --> 1678.08
low classical homeopath

1678.72 --> 1683.679
how fake would you say the war is

1682.48 --> 1686.24
well

1683.679 --> 1688.3990000000001
there is war it's just everything that

1686.24 --> 1690.72
we get to see through mainstream media

1688.399 --> 1693.12
let's just say anything that's even

1690.72 --> 1695.919
remotely pro-ukraine

1693.12 --> 1698.0
is all hundred percent lies 100 percent

1695.919 --> 1700.72
projection if there's something blown up

1698.0 --> 1703.279
ukraine did it it's it's not even

1700.72 --> 1705.52
freaking funny anymore

1703.279 --> 1708.24
this is true

1705.52 --> 1709.9189999999999
and everybody in ukraine pretty much is

1708.24 --> 1713.6
very happy about the russians being

1709.919 --> 1717.3600000000001
there because that stops

1713.6 --> 1719.1999999999998
just houses from blowing up

1717.36 --> 1722.32
yeah

1719.2 --> 1722.32
so yeah 10

1722.48 --> 1728.64
there is a war it's just everything that

1725.2 --> 1732.24
we get to hear on the mainstream news

1728.64 --> 1735.44
from the liberals is 100 lives it's the

1732.24 --> 1735.44
most atrocious

1735.679 --> 1740.64
war

1736.559 --> 1742.8799999999999
criminal lies you can imagine

1740.64 --> 1742.88
and

1743.2 --> 1749.3600000000001
i feel very strongly about

1747.12 --> 1752.559
those responsible

1749.36 --> 1753.52
for specifically for that propaganda

1752.559 --> 1755.36
writing

1753.52 --> 1756.799
specifically for that and carrying out

1755.36 --> 1758.559
that they should be

1756.799 --> 1763.52
held responsible

1758.559 --> 1763.52
in a international criminal court

1787.2 --> 1790.88
hey wrath

1788.48 --> 1795.3990000000001
i gave you a wrench

1790.88 --> 1795.3990000000001
i thought you deserved it for a while

1810.399 --> 1815.9189999999999
am i just saying that to troll the

1812.88 --> 1815.919
liberals no

1817.84 --> 1821.1999999999998
no

1818.96 --> 1822.64
no i mean it

1821.2 --> 1827.88
and

1822.64 --> 1827.88
i want them to know that and squirm

1836.0 --> 1841.919
i want this apparatus this

1838.88 --> 1843.279
quick go to don't think about it system

1841.919 --> 1846.48
that the

1843.279 --> 1850.96
liberals have been using

1846.48 --> 1853.279
is highly amoral often immoral mechanism

1850.96 --> 1854.64
that makes it easy on the liberal

1853.279 --> 1857.84
individual because they don't have to

1854.64 --> 1864.039
think about i want them to pay

1857.84 --> 1864.039
i want them to really really pay

1872.48 --> 1877.559
did mctoon ever get back on this and

1874.559 --> 1877.559
[ __ ]

1879.36 --> 1884.279
no

1880.96 --> 1884.279
no he didn't

1905.039 --> 1907.84
hmm

1929.2 --> 1933.44
yeah

1930.72 --> 1934.48
so yeah aries 106. why why am i doing

1933.44 --> 1937.519
this

1934.48 --> 1940.48
because these liberals

1937.519 --> 1942.32
are all collectively responsible for a

1940.48 --> 1944.159
monster system

1942.32 --> 1947.039
that's being perpetuated because of

1944.159 --> 1950.24
their yay saying to it

1947.039 --> 1955.12
and they are literally now

1950.24 --> 1957.1200000000001
a major influence of like the problems

1955.12 --> 1959.279
that are not gonna go away

1957.12 --> 1960.7199999999998
because of them

1959.279 --> 1964.399
and they need

1960.72 --> 1966.0
to to be made aware of that

1964.399 --> 1967.4399999999998
that they are going to be held

1966.0 --> 1969.84
responsible

1967.44 --> 1973.039
for that

1969.84 --> 1974.72
for sustaining a monster system that is

1973.039 --> 1976.399
only destructive

1974.72 --> 1978.72
like the only place

1976.399 --> 1981.84
it is beneficial

1978.72 --> 1985.679
in any certain way is like where they

1981.84 --> 1987.6
reap money out of the victims

1985.679 --> 1989.279
that's like the only advantage that

1987.6 --> 1991.4399999999998
that's even to be gained out of it like

1989.279 --> 1994.24
liberals going along doesn't even give

1991.44 --> 1996.799
them an advantage other than this

1994.24 --> 1999.36
specific little trick

1996.799 --> 2000.96
persists you can still use that trick

1999.36 --> 2003.12
you can still hide under it that's like

2000.96 --> 2005.6000000000001
the only advantage

2003.12 --> 2008.799
people even get out of it you know you

2005.6 --> 2010.9599999999998
can be a [ __ ] liberal [ __ ] too and

2008.799 --> 2013.039
not realize how [ __ ]

2010.96 --> 2014.0
you are and how much you [ __ ] over the

2013.039 --> 2014.799
world

2014.0 --> 2018.44
yeah

2014.799 --> 2018.44
and it needs to stop

2019.12 --> 2024.399
like the implosion needs to be brought

2021.44 --> 2024.3990000000001
to a dead halt

2026.32 --> 2032.24
and they need to be held responsible

2030.0 --> 2036.2
yeah ralph rodriguez indeed hit the pay

2032.24 --> 2036.2
pal that will be great

2054.48 --> 2058.839
yeah

2056.159 --> 2060.96
it's time for the

2058.839 --> 2062.7999999999997
liberal era

2060.96 --> 2066.0
to end

2062.8 --> 2066.0
and i mean end

2067.359 --> 2071.919
paypal that my face into a smile

2070.159 --> 2074.96
i could use another

2071.919 --> 2078.0789999999997
but i don't want to push it

2074.96 --> 2079.76
but yeah you absolutely

2078.079 --> 2081.599
saved my week

2079.76 --> 2083.679
this week tony

2081.599 --> 2086.679
thank you for that and so did flatter

2083.679 --> 2086.679
sage

2088.399 --> 2092.839
you both together in one go

2111.839 --> 2116.64
right and yeah wrath by the way that

2114.64 --> 2118.0789999999997
the game called bean i think i've

2116.64 --> 2121.04
vaguely heard of that

2118.079 --> 2123.3590000000004
but yeah euclidean three space

2121.04 --> 2125.7599999999998
xyz that's

2123.359 --> 2127.92
that's as old as gaming itself like as

2125.76 --> 2131.28
soon as

2127.92 --> 2134.2400000000002
like the 80s were passed and like a

2131.28 --> 2137.119
conception of 3d modeling even came into

2134.24 --> 2138.9599999999996
being yeah that that's what it is xyz

2137.119 --> 2142.0
it's what it's always been

2138.96 --> 2145.119
like all 3d games

2142.0 --> 2149.119
all use euclidean three space all of

2145.119 --> 2151.6800000000003
them and they all use flat surface maps

2149.119 --> 2153.44
like all these games

2151.68 --> 2156.72
right

2153.44 --> 2159.2000000000003
even the super popular ones

2156.72 --> 2161.2
all of them oh you have a sandbox it's

2159.2 --> 2162.3999999999996
be it's going to be on a flat plane

2161.2 --> 2164.72
guaranteed

2162.4 --> 2165.6800000000003
it is

2164.72 --> 2169.2799999999997
why

2165.68 --> 2172.24
because if you don't do that then the

2169.28 --> 2174.1600000000003
suspension of disbelief doesn't work as

2172.24 --> 2177.04
well yeah

2174.16 --> 2178.56
if it's not on a flat plane then walking

2177.04 --> 2180.56
there in your

2178.56 --> 2182.7999999999997
virtual character

2180.56 --> 2185.2799999999997
it doesn't feel real

2182.8 --> 2188.0
because the earth is flat so in the game

2185.28 --> 2189.2000000000003
it has to be flat or it just won't seem

2188.0 --> 2194.16
as real

2189.2 --> 2194.16
it's that simple it really is yeah

2194.24 --> 2199.7599999999998
and now oh you got baller allergies

2197.839 --> 2202.16
or i mean you got flat earth allergies

2199.76 --> 2204.88
well then just tell them it's on the

2202.16 --> 2206.64
ball you just apply the dingleberry all

2204.88 --> 2208.2400000000002
over again right so it's just like yeah

2206.64 --> 2211.839
this is a flat plane

2208.24 --> 2213.1189999999997
but you can think of it as a ball

2211.839 --> 2215.839
there you go

2213.119 --> 2215.839
problem solved

2228.8 --> 2233.2000000000003
right all these ballers they don't

2231.04 --> 2236.0
really hate flat earth

2233.2 --> 2238.16
they just can't handle it

2236.0 --> 2239.839
flat earth is like their daddy

2238.16 --> 2241.7599999999998
just like putin

2239.839 --> 2244.24
it's their daddy and

2241.76 --> 2247.8390000000004
yeah they wanna be free

2244.24 --> 2249.2
wanna be free in the mind to believe

2247.839 --> 2251.599
yeah yeah but

2249.2 --> 2254.16
it is flat though and like everything is

2251.599 --> 2258.56
done with the knowledge that is flat

2254.16 --> 2261.2
engineering and so yeah

2258.56 --> 2261.92
you gotta deal with daddy eventually you

2261.2 --> 2263.52
know

2261.92 --> 2265.28
it is flat

2263.52 --> 2267.04
everything works because it's flat

2265.28 --> 2268.88
nothing would work on a ball

2267.04 --> 2272.079
but that's okay you can still just look

2268.88 --> 2274.56
at flat planes and think that is a ball

2272.079 --> 2277.8390000000004
that's fine you can do that right just

2274.56 --> 2279.7599999999998
don't try to do anything

2277.839 --> 2282.4
constructive with it other than

2279.76 --> 2284.96
fantasies because yeah the earth isn't

2282.4 --> 2287.599
actually a ball and things don't work

2284.96 --> 2289.839
out if the earth was a wall

2287.599 --> 2292.7200000000003
doesn't really work nothing really works

2289.839 --> 2294.7999999999997
right nothing it never really works

2292.72 --> 2297.04
because all of the ball mechanics even i

2294.8 --> 2299.52
always designed what's really done on

2297.04 --> 2301.7599999999998
the trickery it's all based

2299.52 --> 2304.16
on a flat plane

2301.76 --> 2306.1600000000003
and a ball of stars

2304.16 --> 2308.64
ball of stars and a flat plane and

2306.16 --> 2312.0789999999997
that's what it is that's

2308.64 --> 2314.64
that's the source data for the entire

2312.079 --> 2318.079
ball model

2314.64 --> 2318.0789999999997
there's nothing you can do about it

2324.72 --> 2330.3199999999997
yeah but squirt right like aries 106.

2330.56 --> 2335.599
uses fear so it uses fears

2333.2 --> 2337.359
is it a sphere stars is it

2335.599 --> 2339.6800000000003
because

2337.359 --> 2342.0789999999997
stars are sphere

2339.68 --> 2343.52
there is fear that seemingly surrounds

2342.079 --> 2346.1600000000003
us

2343.52 --> 2347.839
at least half of it demisphere yeah yeah

2346.16 --> 2350.7999999999997
that is a that is a sphere right that's

2347.839 --> 2352.96
the sphere part however

2350.8 --> 2355.28
when then coordinating it with other

2352.96 --> 2356.88
things it's always in reference to a

2355.28 --> 2359.92
flat plane

2356.88 --> 2361.44
the flat plane of earth

2359.92 --> 2363.119
yeah that's how you get the angles

2361.44 --> 2366.0
that's how you get

2363.119 --> 2369.359
that's how you are even able to

2366.0 --> 2371.52
build a coordination system

2369.359 --> 2373.5989999999997
because the freaking earth is flat

2371.52 --> 2376.4
versus the ball of stars that seemingly

2373.599 --> 2378.88
surrounds you if the earth wasn't flat

2376.4 --> 2381.76
you couldn't even freaking build a

2378.88 --> 2384.0
logically consistent coordination system

2381.76 --> 2386.48
that would be reliable you couldn't even

2384.0 --> 2386.48
do that

2389.839 --> 2392.56
so yes

2390.8 --> 2394.079
fears you know spheres are used

2392.56 --> 2396.72
everywhere

2394.079 --> 2397.599
but it's never the sphere of earth you

2396.72 --> 2400.16
might

2397.599 --> 2402.88
draw that over something

2400.16 --> 2405.04
but it's not actually used it's just an

2402.88 --> 2407.52
imagination assist

2405.04 --> 2409.44
for those that can't handle living not

2407.52 --> 2411.119
on a ball

2409.44 --> 2413.28
yeah because

2411.119 --> 2417.28
in the actual coordination

2413.28 --> 2418.96
there is no ball surface being used for

2417.28 --> 2420.079
that

2418.96 --> 2422.4
only

2420.079 --> 2425.119
the apparent demisphere of the

2422.4 --> 2426.88
celestials

2425.119 --> 2428.48
that's the spherical part that's where

2426.88 --> 2430.319
the angular

2428.48 --> 2432.64
relations come in

2430.319 --> 2435.44
that's the only part

2432.64 --> 2438.48
that is spherical because

2435.44 --> 2439.92
it has to then feedback connect to a

2438.48 --> 2442.079
flat plane

2439.92 --> 2443.359
to get any persistence to get any

2442.079 --> 2445.599
logical

2443.359 --> 2449.2
mechanical persistence with it to build

2445.599 --> 2453.28
a mechanism in order to do things

2449.2 --> 2456.0789999999997
it has to coordinate with a flat plane

2453.28 --> 2456.079
that's the point

2458.8 --> 2466.4
literally like the very foundational

2463.44 --> 2468.079
of reason itself

2466.4 --> 2470.48
demands

2468.079 --> 2474.319
that you accept the earth is flat do you

2470.48 --> 2475.599
understand the very core fabric of

2474.319 --> 2478.839
reasoning

2475.599 --> 2482.56
and logic and mechanics

2478.839 --> 2483.599
demands that you accept the earth is

2482.56 --> 2487.52
flat

2483.599 --> 2490.6400000000003
yeah if you don't then you get no grip

2487.52 --> 2494.44
on how things work

2490.64 --> 2494.44
better get over it

2503.92 --> 2510.76
hey slow mo moon buggy

2506.319 --> 2510.7599999999998
from the grave great

2522.72 --> 2525.9199999999996
he's taking star wars

2535.76 --> 2539.6800000000003
why does the navigation use nautical

2537.599 --> 2542.319
miles because it's based on a grid

2539.68 --> 2543.04
system based on the angular relations of

2542.319 --> 2546.0
the

2543.04 --> 2548.16
celestial demisphere

2546.0 --> 2550.56
and their angular yeah with the earth

2548.16 --> 2552.48
the flat plane of the earth it's divided

2550.56 --> 2554.96
up in sections

2552.48 --> 2557.44
the sections is what the nautical mile

2554.96 --> 2560.319
system is based on

2557.44 --> 2563.119
yeah it's a convention that's

2560.319 --> 2565.839
why it doesn't use standard miles from

2563.119 --> 2565.839
the grave

2571.68 --> 2577.52
hey thank you godzilla for the five

2573.839 --> 2577.52
canadian dollar super chat

2577.76 --> 2582.6400000000003
from the grave still desperately trying

2579.839 --> 2584.88
let's all point and laugh folks

2582.64 --> 2587.5989999999997
yeah

2584.88 --> 2589.2000000000003
or just perfectly answer all the

2587.599 --> 2591.28
questions that you think are trick

2589.2 --> 2593.2
questions that prove the globe

2591.28 --> 2595.599
yeah that's what i like to do it's like

2593.2 --> 2597.1189999999997
oh you think you got something

2595.599 --> 2599.76
no you don't

2597.119 --> 2602.079
let me show in like very

2599.76 --> 2605.28
painful detail

2602.079 --> 2607.8390000000004
exactly why that's wrong

2605.28 --> 2607.8390000000004
that's what i do

2608.96 --> 2613.0
donate to my paypal though

2630.48 --> 2635.04
yes i know

2632.0 --> 2637.28
godzilla it's always

2635.04 --> 2638.48
it's like a slot machine right

2637.28 --> 2642.7200000000003
it'll just

2638.48 --> 2645.92
move on to the next scatter gun

2642.72 --> 2649.839
it's a baller shooting range right

2645.92 --> 2649.839
there's gonna be scatter gunning

2650.64 --> 2656.4
most of it's just blanks though right

2654.079 --> 2659.3590000000004
it's basically like a larp it is kind of

2656.4 --> 2660.64
like a metaphorical virtue signal larp

2659.359 --> 2665.119
they're like

2660.64 --> 2665.1189999999997
i a i got a scatter gun here

2666.079 --> 2669.28
and you're just standing there right in

2667.599 --> 2670.88
front of it's like yeah that's all

2669.28 --> 2673.92
blanks ah

2670.88 --> 2675.6800000000003
but he is giving it all you know

2673.92 --> 2678.16
and he's everybody's seeing that like

2675.68 --> 2678.16
i'm going

2678.319 --> 2681.92
and but yeah your target's basically

2680.16 --> 2683.44
just standing there right in front of

2681.92 --> 2687.04
you like

2683.44 --> 2687.04
yeah there's not any bullets coming out

2687.599 --> 2692.8
that's really what's going on here

2689.2 --> 2692.7999999999997
that's what's going on every time

2693.68 --> 2697.319
that's what they do

2712.8 --> 2716.319
yeah you don't point and laugh yeah you

2715.119 --> 2717.04
just

2716.319 --> 2719.359
put

2717.04 --> 2721.2
flat earthers all on one pile and then

2719.359 --> 2723.04
shame that yeah you don't point at

2721.2 --> 2726.0
individuals being flat earthers you'll

2723.04 --> 2728.24
just over generalize

2726.0 --> 2730.48
and then put everybody on the same straw

2728.24 --> 2733.839
man pile yeah we know from the grave

2730.48 --> 2733.839
that doesn't change anything

2742.48 --> 2747.68
see did it write in this very same

2744.8 --> 2749.3590000000004
sentence i just asked a question about

2747.68 --> 2752.48
why they

2749.359 --> 2754.0789999999997
believe what they believe right so oh

2752.48 --> 2756.48
yeah you don't point at an infinite yeah

2754.079 --> 2758.4
but you just address all flat earthers

2756.48 --> 2760.72
like they're all the same

2758.4 --> 2763.44
one person thought

2760.72 --> 2763.4399999999996
that's what you do

2764.64 --> 2769.56
yeah never bring a dingleberry to a

2766.56 --> 2769.56
gunfight

2778.64 --> 2783.52
the dingleberry could also be like a

2780.88 --> 2785.839
bean bag

2783.52 --> 2785.839
right

2785.92 --> 2790.0
would be freaking hilarious to literally

2787.92 --> 2791.359
have bean bags

2790.0 --> 2793.76
from guns

2791.359 --> 2795.92
that are shaped like globe earths and

2793.76 --> 2798.079
including like the print of it so you're

2795.92 --> 2799.92
shooting somebody with a globe earth

2798.079 --> 2803.5600000000004
bean bag

2799.92 --> 2803.56
that would be hilarious

2803.68 --> 2807.48
still painful though

2841.2 --> 2844.2
hmm

2846.079 --> 2849.76
oh that sounds great psycbear

2849.92 --> 2853.839
that's awesome i'm kind of jealous

2856.4 --> 2862.079
oh south park reference let's all point

2858.8 --> 2862.079
it laughs yeah yeah

2862.319 --> 2866.8
yeah have you guys caught up on the new

2864.24 --> 2870.3999999999996
south south park season it's like four

2866.8 --> 2874.4
episodes but like two of them are really

2870.4 --> 2876.64
really epic like they're back

2874.4 --> 2877.76
they're really back

2876.64 --> 2880.8799999999997
they've like

2877.76 --> 2883.119
did a step back from

2880.88 --> 2886.1600000000003
two steps

2883.119 --> 2887.92
forward into the [ __ ] from the last

2886.16 --> 2889.2799999999997
season

2887.92 --> 2892.16
and they're like

2889.28 --> 2894.8
a bit back to how how we all want them

2892.16 --> 2897.68
to be i i thought that the new season so

2894.8 --> 2901.76
far is very very promising very south

2897.68 --> 2903.839
park it really gave me hope like oh god

2901.76 --> 2905.599
at least there they haven't like died or

2903.839 --> 2907.52
something

2905.599 --> 2910.48
haven't like

2907.52 --> 2913.68
vaxxed themselves into

2910.48 --> 2915.28
like brain blood clots or something

2913.68 --> 2917.9199999999996
so they seem like they're back and

2915.28 --> 2917.92
that's great

2920.4 --> 2926.0
i mean did you see like the

2923.599 --> 2927.6800000000003
the like the the russia episode what's

2926.0 --> 2931.04
it called again

2927.68 --> 2932.7999999999997
that one was just like thank you thank

2931.04 --> 2936.0
you south park for

2932.8 --> 2937.3590000000004
just being south park for being real

2936.0 --> 2941.2
i love that

2937.359 --> 2943.04
was it called again back to the cold war

2941.2 --> 2944.8799999999997
episode 4

2943.04 --> 2945.92
season 25

2944.88 --> 2948.1600000000003
like

2945.92 --> 2951.28
that one

2948.16 --> 2954.24
is just it's it's kind of obvious

2951.28 --> 2957.2000000000003
but it's good

2954.24 --> 2959.359
i liked it

2957.2 --> 2961.9199999999996
it was funny and it was kind of

2959.359 --> 2963.68
nostalgic and it was very informative i

2961.92 --> 2967.6800000000003
just thought it was a great

2963.68 --> 2967.68
great social commentary that episode

2968.88 --> 2974.88
and really applicable to like right now

2972.079 --> 2975.92
the situation really

2974.88 --> 2978.8
so

2975.92 --> 2982.2400000000002
like that's a show episode you can show

2978.8 --> 2982.2400000000002
to a whole bunch of people

2982.96 --> 2986.96
like including liberals they'd probably

2985.52 --> 2990.24
appreciate it

2986.96 --> 2990.2400000000002
and that's worth something

2990.96 --> 2998.4
20 season 25 yeah

2994.559 --> 3000.7200000000003
and they're still like 10 years old

2998.4 --> 3003.119
but they are like weirdly self-conscious

3000.72 --> 3005.4399999999996
about that

3003.119 --> 3008.8
and it's hilarious because like the last

3005.44 --> 3010.48
show is like is about teenagers they are

3008.8 --> 3013.28
all 10 year olds

3010.48 --> 3016.4
still after 25 years

3013.28 --> 3018.3190000000004
and then it's like oh teenagers

3016.4 --> 3021.04
but they aren't even though they should

3018.319 --> 3022.24
be way past it's

3021.04 --> 3025.5589999999997
yeah

3022.24 --> 3025.5589999999997
it's good

3032.079 --> 3035.119
put some colloidal silver on those

3033.92 --> 3037.44
plants

3035.119 --> 3041.6400000000003
maybe

3037.44 --> 3041.64
on the soil could help

3043.92 --> 3048.319
also yeah try volcanic ash

3051.2 --> 3054.319
like

3051.92 --> 3056.8
get some volcanic ash and like carefully

3054.319 --> 3059.2799999999997
mix it in with the soil that's good

3056.8 --> 3063.079
stuff that's like

3059.28 --> 3063.079
mineral explosion

3080.64 --> 3086.72
hey that's studio 68

3083.119 --> 3086.7200000000003
long time no see how are you doing man

3091.76 --> 3096.5200000000004
please

3092.72 --> 3096.52
think you're a man right

3106.88 --> 3110.119
i didn't

3113.04 --> 3116.48
yeah about two years indeed

3119.839 --> 3123.7999999999997
what have you been up to

3134.88 --> 3140.6400000000003
yep that's why people live near

3136.4 --> 3142.559
volcanoes and especially all bean types

3140.64 --> 3144.16
do really well right

3142.559 --> 3147.3590000000004
so coffee

3144.16 --> 3150.0789999999997
great on volcanoes

3147.359 --> 3152.72
but yeah green beans also beans so beans

3150.079 --> 3154.319
just happen to work really well with

3152.72 --> 3156.5589999999997
volcanic ash

3154.319 --> 3161.4
and everything else does too but beans

3156.559 --> 3161.4
like really benefit from that

3166.72 --> 3172.24
live streaming on dating app oh okay

3170.559 --> 3177.3590000000004
huh

3172.24 --> 3179.1189999999997
wait you're like having dating party

3177.359 --> 3180.4
playing music on

3179.119 --> 3181.92
like online

3180.4 --> 3182.96
dating

3181.92 --> 3184.079
parties

3182.96 --> 3186.4
what

3184.079 --> 3186.4
okay

3186.559 --> 3190.28
i guess that could work

3202.0 --> 3207.359
this colloidal silver plant crack no

3205.359 --> 3210.48
but colloidal silver is

3207.359 --> 3210.48
universally good

3210.72 --> 3215.359
for like

3212.96 --> 3218.079
immunity cohesion

3215.359 --> 3220.4
and that includes plants so yeah throw

3218.079 --> 3223.8390000000004
that on there and it's going to be good

3220.4 --> 3223.839
for the roots

3224.079 --> 3228.7200000000003
like trace of silver traces of silver in

3226.72 --> 3231.2799999999997
there it's gonna

3228.72 --> 3234.8799999999997
like help prevent

3231.28 --> 3237.8390000000004
root rot and other things

3234.88 --> 3237.839
if that could be an issue

3239.28 --> 3242.1600000000003
dude i liked it

3241.04 --> 3244.88
back

3242.16 --> 3247.1189999999997
is now 10 years ago but when i had some

3244.88 --> 3248.96
cannabis plants that i was like breeding

3247.119 --> 3252.4
in pots

3248.96 --> 3255.52
used volcanic ash on that oh that's good

3252.4 --> 3256.319
but also colored silver and

3255.52 --> 3258.079
like

3256.319 --> 3260.48
they really liked it the plants were

3258.079 --> 3262.88
really happy they were like

3260.48 --> 3265.359
really great

3262.88 --> 3266.559
plants had an excellent

3265.359 --> 3269.72
growth

3266.559 --> 3269.7200000000003
and yield

3281.28 --> 3286.96
ah

3283.359 --> 3286.96
all right that studio

3291.68 --> 3297.2
tony whitcomb that's

3294.64 --> 3300.72
that's terrible joke

3297.2 --> 3300.72
and it's not true either

3300.88 --> 3305.44
i mean ashley is a

3302.96 --> 3307.119
is kind of like a

3305.44 --> 3308.2400000000002
more

3307.119 --> 3309.92
anglo

3308.24 --> 3311.9199999999996
name

3309.92 --> 3315.319
which are not

3311.92 --> 3315.319
around volcanoes

3331.92 --> 3336.16
yeah worse than 10th man pun i agree

3342.319 --> 3349.4
when using copper energy is lost what

3345.68 --> 3349.3999999999996
what are you talking about

3353.119 --> 3358.48
no copper is actually good

3356.4 --> 3360.96
yeah if you're going to do gardening use

3358.48 --> 3362.4
copper tools pure copper

3360.96 --> 3365.28
and they exist

3362.4 --> 3366.799
it is great for the soil

3365.28 --> 3369.6800000000003
i mean don't like

3366.799 --> 3371.7599999999998
ground up copper and then pour it like

3369.68 --> 3374.8799999999997
on the soil

3371.76 --> 3379.76
but have copper basically move through

3374.88 --> 3381.52
the soil use copper tools for gardening

3379.76 --> 3386.4
it's really good

3381.52 --> 3386.4
rudolph steiner was all about that too

3386.96 --> 3391.92
because it works it's like measurable it

3389.92 --> 3394.559
improves the soil it improves the

3391.92 --> 3396.7200000000003
bacteria in the soil

3394.559 --> 3398.2400000000002
silver is superior to copper yeah no

3396.72 --> 3400.3999999999996
it's not

3398.24 --> 3403.2799999999997
you don't make silver

3400.4 --> 3406.1600000000003
gardening tools they'll wear out right

3403.28 --> 3408.079
use copper tools but if you want to

3406.16 --> 3409.7599999999998
utilize silver yeah

3408.079 --> 3412.2400000000002
put some on

3409.76 --> 3414.2400000000002
put some colloidal silver like

3412.24 --> 3416.4799999999996
on the roots

3414.24 --> 3419.799
on the soil where the roots are right

3416.48 --> 3419.799
that's good

3423.04 --> 3427.2799999999997
but copper

3424.799 --> 3433.16
for tools for tooling

3427.28 --> 3433.1600000000003
in gardens is actually excellent do that

3434.319 --> 3438.799
colloidal silver to feminize seeds what

3438.96 --> 3441.28
okay

3444.4 --> 3449.44
i only need trace copper in anything

3447.52 --> 3451.52
yes

3449.44 --> 3454.7200000000003
but that's not what i'm talking about

3451.52 --> 3456.88
and i'm saying copper tools

3454.72 --> 3459.68
right unless you like do everything with

3456.88 --> 3461.76
your hands but hey

3459.68 --> 3464.72
if you're having like your garden is

3461.76 --> 3466.559
kind of big you might end up using tools

3464.72 --> 3468.72
right because you're not all going to do

3466.559 --> 3470.48
that with your hands it's endless work

3468.72 --> 3471.9199999999996
so if you're going to use gardening

3470.48 --> 3475.44
tools

3471.92 --> 3478.559
little shovels rakes try to get

3475.44 --> 3482.2400000000002
copper once like and the

3478.559 --> 3482.2400000000002
yeah those are made by

3482.88 --> 3487.6800000000003
production

3484.64 --> 3490.16
groups that know about that they know

3487.68 --> 3492.799
like copper tools is good they're not

3490.16 --> 3495.7599999999998
going to be super cheap right compared

3492.799 --> 3498.559
to like standard

3495.76 --> 3498.559
mega store

3498.96 --> 3504.319
big sale

3500.64 --> 3508.24
stores all that right but it's good

3504.319 --> 3508.24
copper cheap yeah not that cheap

3512.64 --> 3517.2799999999997
but it is better that's just a fact it's

3515.119 --> 3520.48
better using copper tools for gardening

3517.28 --> 3522.559
it's better especially for food

3520.48 --> 3524.72
trust me on this it is

3522.559 --> 3525.599
it does something special and it's not

3524.72 --> 3528.16
about

3525.599 --> 3530.2400000000002
copper wearing off there and then ending

3528.16 --> 3532.64
up in the soil no it's about literally

3530.24 --> 3534.4799999999996
having copper wires

3532.64 --> 3537.5989999999997
copper rods

3534.48 --> 3540.4
going through the dirt and like having

3537.599 --> 3542.6400000000003
it passed through it it's like a sort of

3540.4 --> 3545.52
like the magnetizing or electrifying

3542.64 --> 3547.68
process that it just naturally does

3545.52 --> 3549.839
without having been plugged into any

3547.68 --> 3552.8799999999997
socket or anything it's just a natural

3549.839 --> 3556.0789999999997
effect that is the good part use copper

3552.88 --> 3557.359
tools in your soil

3556.079 --> 3560.559
don't

3557.359 --> 3562.319
like put copper powder onto the soil

3560.559 --> 3564.2400000000002
that's not good

3562.319 --> 3568.44
use copper tools

3564.24 --> 3568.4399999999996
to work on the soil

3575.76 --> 3580.6400000000003
yeah it's not fertilizer copper is not

3578.72 --> 3583.4399999999996
fertilizer

3580.64 --> 3586.0
i mean hello can i get some feedback

3583.44 --> 3588.16
here instead of just more suggestions

3586.0 --> 3590.0
that are exactly the opposite of what

3588.16 --> 3592.319
i'm saying

3590.0 --> 3594.559
can i get some feedback here yeah it's

3592.319 --> 3597.839
not a fertilizer copper is not to be

3594.559 --> 3599.52
used as a fertilizer it's used for

3597.839 --> 3602.64
gardening tools

3599.52 --> 3605.04
to go through the soil it's good for the

3602.64 --> 3605.04
soil

3605.359 --> 3608.96
not a fertilizer

3611.68 --> 3617.839
you can also use copper wires

3614.559 --> 3620.6400000000003
around the base of a plant or a tree

3617.839 --> 3623.68
that also seems to have like

3620.64 --> 3623.68
good influences

3625.119 --> 3628.839
not a fertilizer

3669.44 --> 3673.92
yeah

3671.2 --> 3677.4399999999996
it's not a fertilizer can i hear you

3673.92 --> 3679.839
george sanford say yeah copper is not to

3677.44 --> 3682.799
be used as a fertilizer

3679.839 --> 3685.359
you keep on comparing it like it's a

3682.799 --> 3690.44
freaking fertilizer it's not i'm not

3685.359 --> 3690.44
telling you to do that don't do that

3707.76 --> 3713.2000000000003
okay that's interesting seeking star

3709.599 --> 3715.6800000000003
water copper sulfate i guess oh that's

3713.2 --> 3718.24
that's separate then i wasn't talking

3715.68 --> 3718.24
about that

3721.039 --> 3727.5200000000004
like hello

3723.68 --> 3731.0389999999998
tools not fertilizer tools not

3727.52 --> 3734.4
fertilizer tools tools a thing you work

3731.039 --> 3738.7990000000004
with in the soil not fertilizer not to

3734.4 --> 3741.92
be thrown on a compost heap

3738.799 --> 3745.0389999999998
yeah can i get a confirmation of that

3741.92 --> 3745.039
now now

3745.52 --> 3751.52
i want you to stop comparing copper with

3748.96 --> 3755.16
other fertilizer i'm not telling you to

3751.52 --> 3755.16
use it as a fertilizer

3775.28 --> 3782.1600000000003
george sanford

3777.76 --> 3787.039
can i get a freaking confirmation now

3782.16 --> 3787.0389999999998
from you specifically george sanford

3804.96 --> 3810.0
wow an actual question from from the

3807.28 --> 3811.8390000000004
grave

3810.0 --> 3814.96
why what's the difference

3811.839 --> 3814.96
for what now

3815.52 --> 3819.7599999999998
i'm asking you

3817.039 --> 3821.92
to stop implying that copper is to be

3819.76 --> 3824.88
used as a fertilizer

3821.92 --> 3827.2000000000003
i specifically say no

3824.88 --> 3829.76
that's not what i'm talking about i'm

3827.2 --> 3832.3999999999996
talking about using them as tools to

3829.76 --> 3836.1600000000003
work in the dirt

3832.4 --> 3839.2000000000003
not fertilizer not oh yeah i'm using it

3836.16 --> 3842.3999999999996
as tool so it can rub off and then

3839.2 --> 3845.0389999999998
indirectly function as a fertilizer no

3842.4 --> 3848.4
i'm specifically talking

3845.039 --> 3853.1600000000003
not that about that not that not as

3848.4 --> 3853.1600000000003
fertilizer as a tool

3860.16 --> 3863.1189999999997
yeah

3861.119 --> 3866.319
and what's the difference good question

3863.119 --> 3868.48
between stainless steel and copper it's

3866.319 --> 3871.92
electrical

3868.48 --> 3874.4
it's an electrical influence

3871.92 --> 3876.48
yeah stainless steel doesn't do anything

3874.4 --> 3878.48
for the soil

3876.48 --> 3881.2
it doesn't make it better it doesn't

3878.48 --> 3882.319
make the micro processes that actually

3881.2 --> 3885.2799999999997
happen

3882.319 --> 3887.839
right fungi microorganisms it's there's

3885.28 --> 3889.599
so much going on in soil especially if

3887.839 --> 3891.2
plants are growing in it

3889.599 --> 3892.0
there's all kinds of things happening in

3891.2 --> 3893.52
there

3892.0 --> 3897.2
and a lot of it

3893.52 --> 3900.079
is also electrical

3897.2 --> 3902.0
well it's been proven that if you work

3900.079 --> 3904.4
on a piece of land

3902.0 --> 3907.92
with copper tools instead of stainless

3904.4 --> 3909.6800000000003
steel tools and it's like empirical here

3907.92 --> 3912.7200000000003
it's proven

3909.68 --> 3916.0789999999997
that plants grow better

3912.72 --> 3918.24
with better crop yields if you use

3916.079 --> 3921.76
copper tools instead of stainless steel

3918.24 --> 3925.1189999999997
tools it's like a significant difference

3921.76 --> 3925.119
measurable difference

3926.799 --> 3933.0389999999998
now how does this happen because

3930.24 --> 3935.359
when you put metal in a ground there's

3933.039 --> 3938.3190000000004
like a constant

3935.359 --> 3940.48
aura on everything everything even

3938.319 --> 3942.48
living beings even a human being as an

3940.48 --> 3944.4
aura it has an influence as an energy

3942.48 --> 3946.88
influence right

3944.4 --> 3949.52
well a copper rod has an influence a

3946.88 --> 3951.28
copper wire has an influence like you

3949.52 --> 3953.68
can measure

3951.28 --> 3955.2000000000003
electric wiring

3953.68 --> 3958.72
at a distance

3955.2 --> 3959.839
yeah because it has an influence so

3958.72 --> 3961.7599999999998
tools

3959.839 --> 3964.4
that are made of metal have an

3961.76 --> 3966.96
electrical influence well guess what

3964.4 --> 3969.52
if you use copper tools in the dirt

3966.96 --> 3971.92
their electrical influence

3969.52 --> 3973.28
will be very beneficial

3971.92 --> 3974.64
to the plants

3973.28 --> 3976.799
compared to

3974.64 --> 3979.2799999999997
any electrical influence that stainless

3976.799 --> 3981.2
steel tools have on the dirt which is

3979.28 --> 3983.039
not really

3981.2 --> 3984.319
positive or negative it doesn't really

3983.039 --> 3989.0
do anything

3984.319 --> 3989.0
yeah that's what i'm talking about

4007.92 --> 4011.92
hydroponics instead of soil

4013.119 --> 4015.52
okay

4018.64 --> 4021.2799999999997
sure

4019.599 --> 4022.6400000000003
you could do that

4021.28 --> 4024.0
it's not going to be as good though

4022.64 --> 4027.52
there's really

4024.0 --> 4027.52
hydroponics is kind of cool

4028.079 --> 4031.92
and it can be a pretty amazing solution

4030.64 --> 4032.72
in like

4031.92 --> 4034.64
well

4032.72 --> 4035.5989999999997
in environments where there's really not

4034.64 --> 4036.8799999999997
a lot of

4035.599 --> 4039.44
fertile

4036.88 --> 4041.28
fertile soil around

4039.44 --> 4042.4
but yeah

4041.28 --> 4047.2400000000002
nothing is

4042.4 --> 4047.2400000000002
better than soil grown food really

4052.319 --> 4056.48
lightning contributes nitrogen to the

4054.319 --> 4059.2799999999997
soil that's interesting i think i heard

4056.48 --> 4059.28
about that yeah

4059.599 --> 4065.1600000000003
anyway

4061.2 --> 4065.16
gonna be back two minutes

4085.839 --> 4088.839
[ __ ]

4151.839 --> 4154.839
uh

4169.759 --> 4173.52
hey rest dad stop the traffic from

4171.6 --> 4175.759
arrested yeah correct

4173.52 --> 4177.6
yeah you do have to add like all the

4175.759 --> 4179.679
nutrients to the hydroponic growth

4177.6 --> 4182.4800000000005
system

4179.679 --> 4185.4400000000005
or it's just gonna be

4182.48 --> 4189.718999999999
a bunch of watery fruits

4185.44 --> 4189.719
that aren't not gonna be nutritious

4213.52 --> 4217.4400000000005
i don't know about that ralph i don't

4215.28 --> 4218.8
know if silver really makes any

4217.44 --> 4221.12
difference in the

4218.8 --> 4225.12
nitrogen side effect of lightning

4221.12 --> 4225.12
striking soil this is a bit

4228.84 --> 4233.04
weird but

4230.719 --> 4233.04
yeah

4233.12 --> 4237.599999999999
dude you might be able to actually

4235.04 --> 4239.5199999999995
that's kind of fascinating though

4237.6 --> 4240.96
if it could be figured out exactly how

4239.52 --> 4242.8
that's happening then you could

4240.96 --> 4245.92
literally like

4242.8 --> 4248.56
try to electrically enhance soil i'd

4245.92 --> 4251.28
imagine by basically having

4248.56 --> 4251.280000000001
a giant

4252.32 --> 4255.599999999999
warehouse full of that [ __ ]

4254.4 --> 4257.5199999999995
having like

4255.6 --> 4260.08
copper rods

4257.52 --> 4263.040000000001
spread out evenly everywhere through it

4260.08 --> 4265.199
and then just the place being subjected

4263.04 --> 4265.199
to

4265.679 --> 4271.52
electricity i don't know how maybe

4268.56 --> 4275.280000000001
like high voltage like a tesla

4271.52 --> 4275.280000000001
wireless type of situation

4276.159 --> 4281.28
which is like i mean lightning bolts are

4278.96 --> 4282.4800000000005
super high voltage that's why they

4281.28 --> 4284.88
actually

4282.48 --> 4287.12
are able to pass through such a fast

4284.88 --> 4288.8
distance

4287.12 --> 4290.8
like that

4288.8 --> 4293.4400000000005
but yeah maybe that's possible

4290.8 --> 4295.52
electrically enhancing soil

4293.44 --> 4297.44
i don't know maybe maybe it's an

4295.52 --> 4298.8
industrial already been figured out and

4297.44 --> 4301.599999999999
they're already applying it just not

4298.8 --> 4304.4800000000005
talking about it i don't know could be

4301.6 --> 4304.4800000000005
this is interesting

4310.88 --> 4317.04
lightning striking the soil would kill

4312.88 --> 4317.04
what if it struck the plant yeah

4326.32 --> 4331.28
i mean most plants being struck by

4328.32 --> 4332.32
likening uh they got a problem most of

4331.28 --> 4335.04
them

4332.32 --> 4338.639999999999
don't really survive

4335.04 --> 4338.64
even if it's a really big tree

4339.36 --> 4343.48
it just fries them internally

4359.679 --> 4363.04
what

4360.719 --> 4368.0
norb's world was growing

4363.04 --> 4371.0
with magnets and electricity okay funky

4368.0 --> 4371.0
weird

4394.88 --> 4400.88
nobody here is a farmer

4397.44 --> 4400.879999999999
uh probably

4403.12 --> 4408.44
yeah

4403.92 --> 4408.4400000000005
not somebody that i've like identified

4412.0 --> 4418.239
i think a lot of us or a lot of you guys

4415.36 --> 4420.96
are like gardening at least but farming

4418.239 --> 4423.5199999999995
is yeah that's big it's a wider scale i

4420.96 --> 4426.64
don't know any of you

4423.52 --> 4429.1990000000005
that are like farmers

4426.64 --> 4432.159000000001
i'd be honored to know you though

4429.199 --> 4434.159
i mean i do try to

4432.159 --> 4436.96
like

4434.159 --> 4438.799999999999
think about farming and how to get it

4436.96 --> 4442.719
better and all that and what would be

4438.8 --> 4442.719
good for farmers etc etc

4447.36 --> 4454.28
you farmed cereal crops okay

4450.239 --> 4454.28
10 years oh okay

4472.08 --> 4475.08
okay

4482.32 --> 4487.36
yeah okay george sanford

4484.8 --> 4487.360000000001
interesting

4490.8 --> 4493.8
ah

4521.76 --> 4528.360000000001
black

4522.84 --> 4528.360000000001
thumb black thumbs down what

4540.48 --> 4546.599999999999
i once ate food that was grown by a

4542.88 --> 4546.6
farmer okay gorgeous

4575.12 --> 4579.599999999999
okay i don't know what that means though

4577.28 --> 4582.32
rath if you don't have a green thumb but

4579.6 --> 4582.320000000001
a black thumb

4582.64 --> 4587.76
i mean

4584.48 --> 4587.759999999999
does that mean you like to

4589.04 --> 4596.5199999999995
work with tar pits or something i don't

4592.08 --> 4596.5199999999995
know how to interpret this

4617.36 --> 4620.48
okay

4618.56 --> 4622.400000000001
a green elevator

4620.48 --> 4625.04
sounds kind of like a modern miller

4622.4 --> 4627.04
seeking still water i mean yeah grinded

4625.04 --> 4630.679
rain drying grounding it back that's

4627.04 --> 4630.679
what a miller does

4636.719 --> 4638.96
hmm

4650.08 --> 4655.64
i still don't know what a black thumb

4652.159 --> 4655.639999999999
what that means

4674.32 --> 4681.599999999999
now rufus ain't hubbins don't bring in

4677.28 --> 4681.599999999999
math that's that's just you

4686.48 --> 4690.718999999999
there's a dating app called farmers only

4689.04 --> 4695.239
that's hilarious

4690.719 --> 4695.2390000000005
i wouldn't know anything about that so

4715.12 --> 4720.96
a black thumb can grow things

4719.12 --> 4725.12
okay

4720.96 --> 4725.12
i never heard of that terminology before

4731.92 --> 4736.719
kind of sounds to me like that would

4734.4 --> 4739.839999999999
imply that you're

4736.719 --> 4740.64
like of the spirit of cain or something

4739.84 --> 4742.159000000001
right

4740.64 --> 4743.52
wasn't that like the whole biblical

4742.159 --> 4745.28
thing that

4743.52 --> 4746.400000000001
that root of the family that they

4745.28 --> 4748.719
couldn't

4746.4 --> 4750.879999999999
grow any fruits on the land that it

4748.719 --> 4754.92
would always run into a disaster that's

4750.88 --> 4754.92
what that reminds me of

4765.199 --> 4769.239
okay rest ahead

4777.36 --> 4779.599999999999
hmm

4787.6 --> 4791.84
if your thumb is completely black

4793.52 --> 4799.0
right

4794.719 --> 4799.0
or you just need to wash it

4817.28 --> 4821.04
i still remember from my old house it

4819.6 --> 4824.8
was so weird

4821.04 --> 4827.199
we had like this drum with tar in it and

4824.8 --> 4830.639
i was like weirded out by that stuff

4827.199 --> 4832.879999999999
like tar tar is freaking weird

4830.639 --> 4836.08
but we had it because basically

4832.88 --> 4836.08
of roof maintenance

4836.159 --> 4840.879999999999
that yeah my parents

4838.8 --> 4842.8
did themselves they did the roofing

4840.88 --> 4844.88
which is kind of impressive but it was

4842.8 --> 4847.92
very problematic and they used tar and

4844.88 --> 4849.84
so there was always like this tar drum

4847.92 --> 4851.36
in the garage and i was like as a little

4849.84 --> 4854.719
kid like

4851.36 --> 4854.719
this stuff is freaky

4854.8 --> 4863.08
yeah don't stick your thumb into it

4857.6 --> 4863.08
it stinks by the way tars stinks a lot

4884.239 --> 4886.5599999999995
yeah

4886.8 --> 4890.400000000001
that's right geoshifter we do say green

4888.96 --> 4891.44
fingers

4890.4 --> 4894.638999999999
it's

4891.44 --> 4894.638999999999
yeah a green thumb

4898.48 --> 4904.638999999999
and i do i i'm good at plants i

4902.48 --> 4906.48
i can't keep them alive actively but

4904.639 --> 4908.8
it's not even like what do i do with the

4906.48 --> 4912.48
fingers it's mostly about

4908.8 --> 4912.4800000000005
what do i do with my spirit

4913.12 --> 4917.12
i really care for plants which is weird

4915.84 --> 4919.4400000000005
maybe

4917.12 --> 4922.639
if i'd have a lot more plants i'd

4919.44 --> 4925.28
probably be able to focus less

4922.639 --> 4926.88
with that ability

4925.28 --> 4929.599999999999
but yeah i don't have a lot of plants

4926.88 --> 4930.56
right now and so then i i really focus

4929.6 --> 4932.719
it

4930.56 --> 4935.120000000001
on like they're my only family kind of

4932.719 --> 4937.52
thing and that works like plants really

4935.12 --> 4937.5199999999995
like it

4937.92 --> 4941.679
still have this oregano plan and it's

4939.92 --> 4943.679
doing great

4941.679 --> 4947.04
even though it seemed like two years ago

4943.679 --> 4947.04
it seemed like it was just dead

4950.48 --> 4956.159
but i kept believing in him

4953.84 --> 4959.84
and he made it through

4956.159 --> 4959.839999999999
or she whatever

4985.76 --> 4990.159000000001
rotating yeah crop rotation is essential

4991.52 --> 4995.120000000001
especially if you also have animals

4994.239 --> 4997.36
right

4995.12 --> 5000.0
because that's the whole thing

4997.36 --> 5003.199
you grow on it

5000.0 --> 5005.52
then you let it rest

5003.199 --> 5006.4
then you basically

5005.52 --> 5010.96
yeah

5006.4 --> 5010.96
allow your cows and all that to go on it

5012.08 --> 5016.8
and then yeah you switch that around so

5014.639 --> 5019.28
don't let your

5016.8 --> 5020.719
your animals sit on one piece of land

5019.28 --> 5022.0
for too long

5020.719 --> 5025.04
they'll over

5022.0 --> 5027.52
saturate it with nitrogen through their

5025.04 --> 5029.5199999999995
through their poo and all that

5027.52 --> 5031.84
but if you rotate it

5029.52 --> 5033.1990000000005
just like with growing on it that works

5031.84 --> 5037.4400000000005
excellent

5033.199 --> 5037.44
owen benjamin's gotten into that too

5038.159 --> 5042.638999999999
it's just very effective

5040.239 --> 5045.44
it keeps everything stable and

5042.639 --> 5046.96
it can over time actually improve the

5045.44 --> 5048.48
soil instead of just keep on

5046.96 --> 5049.52
degenerating it

5048.48 --> 5052.5199999999995
making it

5049.52 --> 5052.52
useless

5059.84 --> 5064.2390000000005
so yeah crop rotation very important

5064.639 --> 5068.719
medieval farmers survived on crop

5067.52 --> 5070.8
rotation

5068.719 --> 5072.4
literally that's the thing that kept

5070.8 --> 5075.84
them all alive

5072.4 --> 5075.839999999999
that they did that

5082.56 --> 5085.56
what

5090.48 --> 5093.959999999999
uh no

5111.44 --> 5116.0
i don't know what you've been reading

5112.88 --> 5116.0
ralph rodriguez but

5119.6 --> 5122.88
yeah just doing a bunch of rituals

5121.84 --> 5127.04
doesn't

5122.88 --> 5128.96
like change the entire nature of a tree

5127.04 --> 5132.32
in order for it to become huge that

5128.96 --> 5135.12
doesn't work unfortunately

5132.32 --> 5138.159
because that would be kind of cool

5135.12 --> 5142.48
i mean big trees are freaking awesome

5138.159 --> 5142.48
but no it just takes a lot of time

5151.36 --> 5156.88
although i think you could probably make

5154.0 --> 5159.199
trees grow bigger if you put them under

5156.88 --> 5162.400000000001
a pre under pressure

5159.199 --> 5164.239
gas pressure if you actually cur trees

5162.4 --> 5166.4
and this has already been

5164.239 --> 5168.32
discussed

5166.4 --> 5171.679
geo shifter who was earlier in chat

5168.32 --> 5172.96
actually had a few videos about that

5171.679 --> 5175.4400000000005
i was certain

5172.96 --> 5179.12
was it fruit trees or tomato trees were

5175.44 --> 5179.12
grown in high pressure

5179.84 --> 5184.4800000000005
yeah like a

5182.88 --> 5186.4800000000005
a growery

5184.48 --> 5188.239
but like under high pressure that was

5186.48 --> 5191.599999999999
like a lot of pressure in there and

5188.239 --> 5193.759999999999
oxygen and like the thing grew

5191.6 --> 5196.8
a lot faster and like the fruits that

5193.76 --> 5199.04
came off it were a lot bigger right so

5196.8 --> 5201.360000000001
that is a thing like that is something

5199.04 --> 5203.92
that you could do if you want a tree to

5201.36 --> 5207.12
go really freaking huge

5203.92 --> 5209.4400000000005
high pressure environment

5207.12 --> 5211.04
that actually works there's no oxygen or

5209.44 --> 5212.4
flutter yeah that's the title of that

5211.04 --> 5214.48
video yeah yeah

5212.4 --> 5216.159
and that's the thing right

5214.48 --> 5219.44
there's no ritual

5216.159 --> 5219.44
it's just you have to

5219.52 --> 5225.120000000001
give it the conditions to actually grow

5221.6 --> 5227.280000000001
that big and fast

5225.12 --> 5230.719
and then yeah if you then

5227.28 --> 5231.759999999999
let it regrow really big and fast

5230.719 --> 5233.28
then

5231.76 --> 5235.1990000000005
eventually it's going to outgrow the

5233.28 --> 5237.12
container because you do require it to

5235.199 --> 5239.759999999999
be in a container to pressurize it like

5237.12 --> 5242.8
that and then eventually it's going to

5239.76 --> 5245.360000000001
have to adapt and survive

5242.8 --> 5247.28
being released from the higher pressure

5245.36 --> 5249.599999999999
it could die from that right if it

5247.28 --> 5252.159
literally grew in that condition and

5249.6 --> 5254.4800000000005
then the high pressure is taken away it

5252.159 --> 5255.36
could simply just like

5254.48 --> 5256.638999999999
choke

5255.36 --> 5259.12
not

5256.639 --> 5261.04
not be able to survive that so it has to

5259.12 --> 5263.5199999999995
adapt

5261.04 --> 5266.719
and then that could be a way to like

5263.52 --> 5268.639
quickly grow bigger trees or something

5266.719 --> 5270.639
instead of waiting

5268.639 --> 5272.0
for

5270.639 --> 5274.4800000000005
centuries

5272.0 --> 5278.48
but yeah it could still die

5274.48 --> 5282.159
because yeah a sudden abrupt switch

5278.48 --> 5284.638999999999
from pressure that you've grown up in

5282.159 --> 5287.04
all your life that has a pretty radical

5284.639 --> 5289.4400000000005
influence if that certainly changes

5287.04 --> 5291.36
like they could die from that but they

5289.44 --> 5294.4
could survive and then they'll just not

5291.36 --> 5296.48
grow as quickly from that point on

5294.4 --> 5299.04
so

5296.48 --> 5301.12
but i don't know any ritual that would

5299.04 --> 5304.639
do that

5301.12 --> 5304.639
hey what's that steamy traveler

5305.52 --> 5308.719
i assume that doesn't work on wheat

5307.04 --> 5311.04
plants

5308.719 --> 5312.4
you'd be surprised roofie

5311.04 --> 5315.44
rufus

5312.4 --> 5317.44
it actually does it probably would work

5315.44 --> 5319.759999999999
for wheat plants because wheat plants

5317.44 --> 5319.759999999999
are

5320.159 --> 5322.96
like

5321.04 --> 5326.159
they're already weeds

5322.96 --> 5328.159
they're like not tough to grow they grow

5326.159 --> 5330.799999999999
quickly and then they die and they grow

5328.159 --> 5333.839999999999
new so that would work probably extra

5330.8 --> 5335.04
well pressurized yeah it would work

5333.84 --> 5337.12
better

5335.04 --> 5340.32
they would probably grow bigger and

5337.12 --> 5342.4
yield bigger crops they would

5340.32 --> 5344.719
i probably gave a whole bunch of weed

5342.4 --> 5347.44
growers a big idea now if they didn't

5344.719 --> 5349.6
have that already secretly as their

5347.44 --> 5351.839999999999
secret trade craft

5349.6 --> 5351.84
knowledge

5352.719 --> 5356.8
keep it secret keep it safe and all

5362.84 --> 5366.32
cool

5364.4 --> 5368.96
thank you for that link

5366.32 --> 5370.799999999999
steamy traveler

5368.96 --> 5375.159
i guess that supports

5370.8 --> 5375.159000000001
what i was talking about cool

5386.8 --> 5389.8
uh

5396.0 --> 5400.32
right godzilla i agree showing daily

5398.96 --> 5402.159
love

5400.32 --> 5404.4
could be seen as a ritual it's a

5402.159 --> 5407.44
connection it's the spirit right

5404.4 --> 5409.679
what's magic it's doing [ __ ] with your

5407.44 --> 5412.48
spirit

5409.679 --> 5414.639
that's magic like all of it

5412.48 --> 5416.638999999999
all magic is that doing things with your

5414.639 --> 5418.159000000001
spirit yeah it's really bizarre

5416.639 --> 5420.4800000000005
especially if you don't know how to do

5418.159 --> 5422.4
that if you don't have a good sight on

5420.48 --> 5425.12
on that you don't have like you're are

5422.4 --> 5426.5599999999995
you awake and then you see it

5425.12 --> 5428.4
right

5426.56 --> 5429.679
because you could think that you're like

5428.4 --> 5431.36
that just because you know about it

5429.679 --> 5433.52
doesn't mean that you're actually gonna

5431.36 --> 5436.32
get a good feel for it

5433.52 --> 5439.040000000001
but yeah giving plants love

5436.32 --> 5442.96
and attention yeah that works just works

5439.04 --> 5446.48
just like in a human relationship

5442.96 --> 5448.4800000000005
it's literally good for your health

5446.48 --> 5452.32
a good loving relationship with somebody

5448.48 --> 5454.239
who has personal attention and dynamics

5452.32 --> 5456.08
right that are dynamic

5454.239 --> 5457.678999999999
not just going to give up at the first

5456.08 --> 5460.239
like sign of trouble

5457.679 --> 5464.4800000000005
yeah that's really healthy for you and

5460.239 --> 5467.599999999999
so would it be for plants a human plant

5464.48 --> 5469.28
caretaker relation yeah the same

5467.6 --> 5472.639
take good care of the plant it's gonna

5469.28 --> 5475.199
do better why because of the spirit

5472.639 --> 5478.2390000000005
it's not even like what you do if you

5475.199 --> 5480.48
are like ordered to take a super careful

5478.239 --> 5482.879999999999
care of a plant but you freaking hate

5480.48 --> 5484.638999999999
the plan and you just have to do it it's

5482.88 --> 5486.8
not going to work as well

5484.639 --> 5490.159000000001
as somebody that's like oh i love this

5486.8 --> 5491.84
freaking planet oh it's my baby

5490.159 --> 5494.32
right and then actually

5491.84 --> 5495.360000000001
be a good caretaker also that's kind of

5494.32 --> 5497.759999999999
important

5495.36 --> 5499.5199999999995
just love doesn't do much if you don't

5497.76 --> 5501.1990000000005
know what to do

5499.52 --> 5502.2390000000005
if you don't know how to actually care

5501.199 --> 5505.199
take

5502.239 --> 5507.12
but that will work

5505.199 --> 5510.08
because of the spirit because of the

5507.12 --> 5512.5599999999995
connection you get

5510.08 --> 5514.32
popularly called love

5512.56 --> 5516.0
right that's how it popularly is

5514.32 --> 5518.88
addressed

5516.0 --> 5520.639
people that don't really know a lot

5518.88 --> 5523.12
that's what they call that it's the

5520.639 --> 5523.12
connection

5527.679 --> 5531.04
yeah derp alert that's i'm not gonna

5529.679 --> 5533.84
address that

5531.04 --> 5533.84
numpty

5534.96 --> 5538.44
get out of here

5587.199 --> 5589.839999999999
what

5591.679 --> 5595.12
what are you talking about ralph

5593.84 --> 5597.4400000000005
rodriguez

5595.12 --> 5600.44
like i have no idea what you're talking

5597.44 --> 5600.44
about

5614.4 --> 5618.159
i mean are you in the middle of a

5615.84 --> 5620.2390000000005
conversation what what does that have to

5618.159 --> 5621.599999999999
do with anything that we're talking

5620.239 --> 5626.36
about i don't know what you're talking

5621.6 --> 5626.360000000001
about it seems like out of nowhere

5638.239 --> 5643.678999999999
or is it some kind of a movie

5640.8 --> 5645.84
the burning is that a movie to which you

5643.679 --> 5647.6
are referencing because otherwise i have

5645.84 --> 5648.719
no freaking idea what you're talking

5647.6 --> 5651.719
about

5648.719 --> 5651.719
either

5660.08 --> 5664.08
he was referencing the troll

5668.48 --> 5672.5199999999995
oh

5669.52 --> 5672.52
okay

5681.6 --> 5684.6
right

5699.119 --> 5705.04
yeah it's true though

5702.4 --> 5706.0
that i would prefer if you'd not do that

5705.04 --> 5709.5199999999995
like

5706.0 --> 5709.52
derp alerts yeah but

5711.36 --> 5716.239
i mean some of these derpers can

5713.44 --> 5720.719
actually be halfway tamed

5716.239 --> 5720.718999999999
apparently like from the grave i mean

5721.44 --> 5725.839999999999
he was literally just joining in the

5723.36 --> 5726.839999999999
conversation in a non-trollish way just

5725.84 --> 5732.32
the other

5726.84 --> 5732.32
moment right it's it is kind of special

5733.119 --> 5737.5199999999995
but he too like this

5736.48 --> 5739.759999999999
numpty

5737.52 --> 5743.280000000001
have dinkle

5739.76 --> 5745.4400000000005
two started out doing exactly that

5743.28 --> 5748.8
oh flat earth

5745.44 --> 5751.5199999999995
a complete joke of an ideology belief

5748.8 --> 5754.8
system cult religion what the [ __ ] it's

5751.52 --> 5757.280000000001
just another 100 projection again

5754.8 --> 5760.2390000000005
these guys are all the same they're just

5757.28 --> 5762.239
ball earth virtue signaling they don't

5760.239 --> 5765.199
know what the [ __ ] they're talking about

5762.239 --> 5769.48
and they project everything

5765.199 --> 5769.48
they live in a reverse world

5775.36 --> 5782.08
you're not a troll though yeah you kind

5777.44 --> 5782.08
of are but i think you're recovering

5783.04 --> 5788.76
most trolls are just trolls because they

5784.96 --> 5788.76
don't really have a life

5799.119 --> 5803.36
i was told to question everything by who

5804.0 --> 5808.239
by who

5805.28 --> 5808.239
who told you that

5809.84 --> 5817.76
and why is that like all

5813.679 --> 5817.76
shouldn't there be like more to that

5817.92 --> 5822.0
than just

5819.04 --> 5823.92
being told to ask questions

5822.0 --> 5826.56
why why are you asking questions what's

5823.92 --> 5828.639
the objective what's the point what are

5826.56 --> 5830.080000000001
the things that you should

5828.639 --> 5831.92
be

5830.08 --> 5833.119
expecting as an answer and how are you

5831.92 --> 5835.76
going to deal with that what's your

5833.119 --> 5835.759999999999
growth curve

5836.0 --> 5838.8
what are you doing

5839.28 --> 5841.84
do you know

5842.08 --> 5847.84
or you just get told yeah ask questions

5845.199 --> 5847.839999999999
and that's it

5850.639 --> 5856.400000000001
that's all you need you don't need any

5853.04 --> 5856.4
more refinement from that

5858.56 --> 5862.2390000000005
eric tobay said we should question

5860.48 --> 5864.799999999999
everything

5862.239 --> 5864.799999999999
well yeah

5867.04 --> 5870.32
i bet he would say that

5871.92 --> 5875.679
this is that couple around for three

5873.6 --> 5879.8
guys it's a bit

5875.679 --> 5879.8
he doesn't know me that long

5910.0 --> 5914.239
i question whether we should question

5912.239 --> 5916.879999999999
everything

5914.239 --> 5916.879999999999
a good one

5917.199 --> 5920.159
right

5918.08 --> 5921.92
but the thing is about question

5920.159 --> 5925.119
everything this trope there is a thing

5921.92 --> 5927.84
about there's a spell a very complicated

5925.119 --> 5930.5599999999995
spell that's in the subconscious yeah

5927.84 --> 5933.76
question everything trope

5930.56 --> 5937.119000000001
what it secretly implies

5933.76 --> 5937.119000000001
is not a good thing is

5937.199 --> 5942.638999999999
question everything

5938.88 --> 5943.76
because it's all fake

5942.639 --> 5946.88
yeah

5943.76 --> 5950.320000000001
but that's not good

5946.88 --> 5954.0
because not everything is fake it's just

5950.32 --> 5956.0
you need to be able to distinguish yeah

5954.0 --> 5958.88
look everywhere

5956.0 --> 5960.4
and then figure out is this wrong or is

5958.88 --> 5962.400000000001
this right

5960.4 --> 5965.759999999999
why

5962.4 --> 5968.5599999999995
why is it that answer

5965.76 --> 5969.84
why is that being chosen to be the

5968.56 --> 5972.320000000001
answer

5969.84 --> 5974.56
for what cause

5972.32 --> 5976.159
right that's the real question

5974.56 --> 5978.8
everything

5976.159 --> 5980.638999999999
not just question everything because

5978.8 --> 5982.639
it's all fake because then you don't

5980.639 --> 5984.400000000001
actually question everything you just

5982.639 --> 5986.32
look at everything and start pointing

5984.4 --> 5988.32
it's fake because it has to be

5986.32 --> 5989.5199999999995
everything is fake right question

5988.32 --> 5991.5199999999995
everything

5989.52 --> 5993.679
is what it leads to

5991.52 --> 5996.320000000001
unless

5993.679 --> 5997.52
you consciously approach that a lot more

5996.32 --> 6000.08
careful

5997.52 --> 6003.1990000000005
and then start to figure out why are

6000.08 --> 6003.199
things the way they are

6006.08 --> 6010.48
because otherwise it's just going to be

6008.0 --> 6012.08
like oh question everything that means

6010.48 --> 6014.5599999999995
everything is fake

6012.08 --> 6016.239
which will cause you to not question

6014.56 --> 6019.04
everything you're just going to point at

6016.239 --> 6022.04
it and say it's fake

6019.04 --> 6022.04
right

6026.56 --> 6034.280000000001
back from a timer no no he's banned

6030.48 --> 6034.28
i kicked his ass

6064.08 --> 6068.639
and dave yeah it's not the dave henkel

6066.639 --> 6072.0
joyous jewish it's probably just a

6068.639 --> 6076.1990000000005
reference it was have dinkle

6072.0 --> 6076.199
not not dave ingle

6107.04 --> 6110.88
yep

6108.159 --> 6113.5199999999995
yeah knowledge without wisdom is pretty

6110.88 --> 6115.6
much useless

6113.52 --> 6118.159000000001
right and that's typical because

6115.6 --> 6121.92
everybody gets to face knowledge in

6118.159 --> 6125.04
their life especially when they're young

6121.92 --> 6126.96
happens so you don't have the wisdom so

6125.04 --> 6128.56
are you then able to do something

6126.96 --> 6130.96
constructive with it

6128.56 --> 6132.0
the younger you are the chances that you

6130.96 --> 6133.679
will be

6132.0 --> 6136.719
is smaller

6133.679 --> 6138.96
to compare compared to when you're older

6136.719 --> 6140.4800000000005
you gain wisdom you actually do then

6138.96 --> 6142.32
figure out hey

6140.48 --> 6145.678999999999
i could have done this with this

6142.32 --> 6149.599999999999
situation i could have done that

6145.679 --> 6152.2390000000005
right everybody goes through that

6149.6 --> 6155.4400000000005
because you then

6152.239 --> 6158.239
have built like the inner stability the

6155.44 --> 6161.44
the all these energy things that lead up

6158.239 --> 6163.36
to being able to be clearer

6161.44 --> 6166.08
make better decisions because you're

6163.36 --> 6168.799999999999
more stable you have a better grip you

6166.08 --> 6170.4
have less anxiety about

6168.8 --> 6172.159000000001
what you're dealing with

6170.4 --> 6174.879999999999
because you're more used to it you let

6172.159 --> 6176.96
it you were able to let it all sink

6174.88 --> 6180.56
you survive through it gain more

6176.96 --> 6180.56
confidence that's wisdom

6182.8 --> 6188.400000000001
or that is the same root as wisdom

6185.36 --> 6191.5199999999995
that's what leads to eventual real pure

6188.4 --> 6193.36
wisdom which is very hard to attain

6191.52 --> 6195.6
but everybody starts out being

6193.36 --> 6198.08
confronted by things that they do not

6195.6 --> 6200.4800000000005
have enough wisdom to handle i my life

6198.08 --> 6205.04
was full of that in my youth and it was

6200.48 --> 6207.5199999999995
like really really frustrating for me

6205.04 --> 6210.32
just saw all these things and just

6207.52 --> 6212.88
very young age seeing how screwed up the

6210.32 --> 6214.48
world is and how [ __ ] people are and

6212.88 --> 6215.92
like

6214.48 --> 6218.0
people

6215.92 --> 6220.719
that i was supposed to be even looking

6218.0 --> 6222.4
up to it's like yeah you're elders they

6220.719 --> 6226.4
should know better they should be wiser

6222.4 --> 6228.32
they should be smarter but they're not

6226.4 --> 6231.04
yeah you know how unbelievably

6228.32 --> 6232.96
frustrating that is as a little kid

6231.04 --> 6235.679
that you're already seeing that but you

6232.96 --> 6237.92
don't know what to do about it you don't

6235.679 --> 6239.84
know

6237.92 --> 6242.159
what to do with that world that you're

6239.84 --> 6242.159000000001
seeing

6243.119 --> 6248.159
right

6245.199 --> 6248.159
it's pretty tough

6248.4 --> 6253.04
but when you grow older you do

6250.4 --> 6256.159
eventually figure it out what you

6253.04 --> 6256.159
couldn't back it in

6256.719 --> 6261.119
with the same level of knowledge and

6258.4 --> 6262.48
that's why i also typically now in this

6261.119 --> 6265.839999999999
frame

6262.48 --> 6268.959999999999
time frame of my life like to throw back

6265.84 --> 6271.119000000001
go back to my youth even as a little kid

6268.96 --> 6273.36
and highlight those moments that i still

6271.119 --> 6276.239
have a memory of

6273.36 --> 6279.119
and that i've not

6276.239 --> 6280.799999999999
like i still remember how at the time i

6279.119 --> 6283.44
was struggling with these things

6280.8 --> 6285.92
energetically and not like the overall

6283.44 --> 6288.08
backdrop sensation of what how i had to

6285.92 --> 6289.1990000000005
deal with it and how pointless it would

6288.08 --> 6292.159
seem

6289.199 --> 6294.4
and how demoralizing it was to me

6292.159 --> 6297.92
but i can throw that personal experience

6294.4 --> 6301.04
to the side and and then catch that

6297.92 --> 6303.04
the gem of that moment the information

6301.04 --> 6304.88
and its purity that god actually did

6303.04 --> 6307.28
present to me at the time even though i

6304.88 --> 6308.96
was able to not able to handle it i can

6307.28 --> 6311.599999999999
handle that now

6308.96 --> 6315.119
and it's not been destroyed

6311.6 --> 6317.1990000000005
by the coloration that i myself in that

6315.119 --> 6320.4
time frame gave it

6317.199 --> 6322.08
i can basically rub that off like like

6320.4 --> 6324.719
oh you silly child you didn't know what

6322.08 --> 6328.84
to do with it but i can still grab it i

6324.719 --> 6331.52
can grab it out of that time through my

6328.84 --> 6334.08
mind and

6331.52 --> 6337.76
use it with the full

6334.08 --> 6339.84
wisdom and talent that is utilized in my

6337.76 --> 6342.400000000001
life in this time frame

6339.84 --> 6343.360000000001
i'm very happy about that that i can

6342.4 --> 6346.159
just

6343.36 --> 6348.48
think back and just grab something out

6346.159 --> 6351.599999999999
of that time

6348.48 --> 6354.4
through my experience

6351.6 --> 6357.4400000000005
from back then

6354.4 --> 6360.879999999999
and it's weird you know why because back

6357.44 --> 6362.159
then i knew i was going to be able to do

6360.88 --> 6364.8
that

6362.159 --> 6367.199
i knew it as a kid that i was going to

6364.8 --> 6369.1990000000005
be able to do that that's why i wasn't

6367.199 --> 6371.44
like i don't want to know i don't want

6369.199 --> 6373.28
to know this i hate this i can't do

6371.44 --> 6376.96
anything with this it just makes me feel

6373.28 --> 6379.599999999999
stupid i knew like no i have to sit on

6376.96 --> 6383.04
this because if i wait long enough then

6379.6 --> 6385.119000000001
in the future i will be able to use it i

6383.04 --> 6388.08
knew that i knew that as a kid and

6385.119 --> 6390.08
nobody told me nobody well people did

6388.08 --> 6391.36
tell me like oh as you grow up you grow

6390.08 --> 6393.28
wiser

6391.36 --> 6395.04
and then eventually you'll figure it out

6393.28 --> 6397.199
right that's what everybody gets to hear

6395.04 --> 6400.56
at some point as a kid

6397.199 --> 6403.04
well i knew more

6400.56 --> 6406.639
i knew more than just that

6403.04 --> 6409.199
i knew that i was going to be able to

6406.639 --> 6412.0
use it on a high level

6409.199 --> 6414.799999999999
that i could not in that time moment and

6412.0 --> 6416.56
i treasured that i treasured that it's

6414.8 --> 6418.2390000000005
like i used the knowledge that i

6416.56 --> 6421.4400000000005
couldn't use

6418.239 --> 6424.239
encapsulated it carefully stored it in

6421.44 --> 6426.48
the back of my mind and heart

6424.239 --> 6428.718999999999
in my subconscious i carefully stored

6426.48 --> 6430.5599999999995
everything that i came across i didn't

6428.719 --> 6433.76
throw it out in frustration because of

6430.56 --> 6436.719
my contemporary inability

6433.76 --> 6437.92
i stored everything

6436.719 --> 6439.679
carefully

6437.92 --> 6442.719
and now

6439.679 --> 6444.88
the doors have opened

6442.719 --> 6447.76
of that storage space

6444.88 --> 6449.92
roughly starting like six years ago

6447.76 --> 6452.0
six seven years ago

6449.92 --> 6455.119
that storage space had been opened and

6452.0 --> 6456.88
hey people might remember me being in

6455.119 --> 6459.759999999999
back chats in one-on-one conversations

6456.88 --> 6463.84
like oh dude i've seen this envision and

6459.76 --> 6466.96
i was so because the doors were opened

6463.84 --> 6469.28
it got open i gained access

6466.96 --> 6472.4800000000005
to what i have been carefully storing

6469.28 --> 6474.88
away all my life i suddenly gained

6472.48 --> 6477.44
access and it was like dude

6474.88 --> 6480.400000000001
holy [ __ ] what the [ __ ] have i been

6477.44 --> 6482.48
experiencing this is amazing

6480.4 --> 6484.799999999999
what is this giant puzzle what is this

6482.48 --> 6486.32
vision thing

6484.8 --> 6487.52
what

6486.32 --> 6489.599999999999
is this

6487.52 --> 6491.84
because all that thing all those things

6489.6 --> 6494.0
i've been storing in the in the fore

6491.84 --> 6496.159000000001
knowledge as a kid that i am going to

6494.0 --> 6498.96
understand this on a high level in the

6496.159 --> 6501.199
future but not now

6498.96 --> 6504.4
carefully store it away

6501.199 --> 6506.799999999999
that closet had been open

6504.4 --> 6509.679
six seven years ago

6506.8 --> 6513.28
and all the like treasure that i had

6509.679 --> 6516.2390000000005
been gathering was there

6513.28 --> 6516.239
and it's still there

6518.88 --> 6524.639
right sounds all very metaphorical but

6522.239 --> 6526.718999999999
i am very much in the trust that there's

6524.639 --> 6528.719
i'm not the only one

6526.719 --> 6530.719
yeah this is not a our win unique

6528.719 --> 6533.84
ability this is

6530.719 --> 6538.159
a whole bunch of people

6533.84 --> 6538.159000000001
have been able to do that

6538.719 --> 6543.44
they started out very freaking bright

6541.6 --> 6545.76
they got to see a whole bunch of things

6543.44 --> 6548.96
about the world they couldn't handle

6545.76 --> 6550.96
but they would trust in god and in them

6548.96 --> 6552.639
themselves and throughout time that they

6550.96 --> 6555.599
would one day

6552.639 --> 6557.04
be able to use it on the the level that

6555.599 --> 6559.1990000000005
it deserved

6557.04 --> 6561.599
so they started away forgot about it and

6559.199 --> 6564.239
went on and then at a later point in

6561.599 --> 6566.159000000001
life they also it's just like

6564.239 --> 6568.239
it might even be in a direct sense

6566.159 --> 6569.36
associated with the midlife crisis

6568.239 --> 6572.48
effect

6569.36 --> 6574.799999999999
maybe that mid-life crisis is that door

6572.48 --> 6576.638999999999
certainly opening if you had been

6574.8 --> 6578.2390000000005
storing stuff in your life throughout

6576.639 --> 6581.04
the youth that you couldn't handle maybe

6578.239 --> 6583.598999999999
that is the effect that happens

6581.04 --> 6585.5199999999995
with the midlife crisis that that is the

6583.599 --> 6588.639
the time point

6585.52 --> 6590.639
where on average people become able to

6588.639 --> 6593.119
actually do something with it and so

6590.639 --> 6594.0
that door suddenly opens and they get

6593.119 --> 6596.08
all

6594.0 --> 6598.8
oh i feel young again i didn't want to

6596.08 --> 6600.88
feel this again right because the door

6598.8 --> 6603.52
opens of that thing those things they've

6600.88 --> 6606.0
been storing in their life

6603.52 --> 6607.280000000001
still with the raw energy of when they

6606.0 --> 6609.52
were young

6607.28 --> 6610.96
so they become

6609.52 --> 6612.8
seduced

6610.96 --> 6615.44
and nostalgic

6612.8 --> 6615.4400000000005
naturally

6617.599 --> 6622.92
isn't that interesting think about it

6619.76 --> 6622.92
like that

6624.0 --> 6628.8
i will probably mod you up in a few

6626.239 --> 6630.159
weeks because i like you

6628.8 --> 6632.159000000001
don't

6630.159 --> 6634.159
don't overplay yourself

6632.159 --> 6635.839999999999
from the grave

6634.159 --> 6638.239
i mean there's people in here that have

6635.84 --> 6641.360000000001
been in my chat for years and years and

6638.239 --> 6641.36
they don't get wrenches

6643.04 --> 6645.679
but hey

6644.48 --> 6648.4
you're

6645.679 --> 6650.719
better than you were two days ago

6648.4 --> 6652.638999999999
so who knows

6650.719 --> 6656.88
what

6652.639 --> 6659.1990000000005
yeah you you might be overestimating

6656.88 --> 6661.76
your quality

6659.199 --> 6665.678999999999
that's fine

6661.76 --> 6667.599
it's better than just throwing

6665.679 --> 6670.4
giving it all up throwing it in the

6667.599 --> 6672.719
trash and just saying

6670.4 --> 6672.719
you know

6673.679 --> 6678.84
you can buy my wrench for much money

6678.91 --> 6684.199
[Music]

6680.239 --> 6684.199
thank you for that year shifter

6704.88 --> 6710.8
do you eat lamb

6706.84 --> 6710.8
what who are you asking

6719.92 --> 6725.04
what happened to my crypto i kind of

6721.599 --> 6727.360000000001
gave up on the geoshifter

6725.04 --> 6729.84
i hadn't really gotten anything from it

6727.36 --> 6732.5599999999995
and it's

6729.84 --> 6734.84
i don't have like a

6732.56 --> 6737.280000000001
crypto

6734.84 --> 6740.4800000000005
wizardry station

6737.28 --> 6742.96
so even if i did get that i i wouldn't

6740.48 --> 6744.718999999999
know how to quickly and efficiently

6742.96 --> 6746.2390000000005
basically turn it into money that i

6744.719 --> 6748.2390000000005
could use

6746.239 --> 6750.4
so

6748.239 --> 6752.0
yeah at first i thought like oh this is

6750.4 --> 6754.32
going to explode people are just going

6752.0 --> 6756.0
to have crypto laying around that they

6754.32 --> 6758.159
want to throw at people so i kind of

6756.0 --> 6760.0
like okay here's the wallet i hadn't

6758.159 --> 6760.879999999999
really gotten anything and it seems like

6760.0 --> 6763.119
now

6760.88 --> 6765.36
most crypto enthusiasts are just kind of

6763.119 --> 6766.88
like sitting on their treasure like a

6765.36 --> 6768.88
bunch of dragons

6766.88 --> 6772.159000000001
so that's probably not gonna happen so i

6768.88 --> 6772.159000000001
just kind of took it out again

6772.88 --> 6779.28
also rumors about like infected crypto

6776.159 --> 6780.638999999999
and [ __ ] didn't really help either

6779.28 --> 6784.239
so

6780.639 --> 6786.88
yeah i don't really need that

6784.239 --> 6787.759999999999
i mean if you're like hey or when i have

6786.88 --> 6789.76
like

6787.76 --> 6793.52
a pretty substantial amount of crypto

6789.76 --> 6796.159000000001
that i would like you to be able to use

6793.52 --> 6797.599
well we might be able to arrange

6796.159 --> 6799.839999999999
something

6797.599 --> 6800.8
don't just throw [ __ ] at me like that

6799.84 --> 6802.8
but

6800.8 --> 6804.8
we could talk about it and then maybe i

6802.8 --> 6807.1990000000005
could do something with it right with

6804.8 --> 6811.52
the proper

6807.199 --> 6813.44
the good conversation about it before

6811.52 --> 6816.0
right but it's just not in the standard

6813.44 --> 6818.159
options anymore i really prefer paypal

6816.0 --> 6821.199
that really helps they haven't blocked

6818.159 --> 6823.679
me yet and i'm really thankful for that

6821.199 --> 6825.119
and a bit weirded out because so many

6823.679 --> 6827.4400000000005
people have been

6825.119 --> 6829.679
for political reasons

6827.44 --> 6833.678999999999
and i myself

6829.679 --> 6835.36
have pretty much gone over those borders

6833.679 --> 6837.119
right

6835.36 --> 6839.119
but they haven't blocked me for they

6837.119 --> 6841.36
haven't punished me for that and i'm

6839.119 --> 6844.4
kind of glad i don't want to have that

6841.36 --> 6847.199
and i don't want oh i'm a special boy i

6844.4 --> 6849.44
got blocked i'm special i got blocked no

6847.199 --> 6851.759999999999
i don't give a [ __ ] about that i just

6849.44 --> 6853.919999999999
want to be able to do what i do i want

6851.76 --> 6855.76
to be able to eat that's kind of what i

6853.92 --> 6858.32
want to do

6855.76 --> 6860.8
i don't care to be blocked just to have

6858.32 --> 6863.84
a special i was blocked badge i don't

6860.8 --> 6863.84
give a [ __ ] about that

6866.08 --> 6870.08
i mean if i'm gonna be blocked you damn

6868.159 --> 6873.199
well better believe i'm gonna brag about

6870.08 --> 6876.159
it is not something that i want to be

6873.199 --> 6878.719
standardized in what i do i just want to

6876.159 --> 6881.36
be able to do what i do

6878.719 --> 6884.52
and being blocked is not very convenient

6881.36 --> 6884.5199999999995
for that

6891.84 --> 6896.2390000000005
i hate paypal need to use it sometimes

6895.119 --> 6898.799999999999
well

6896.239 --> 6900.5599999999995
i'm not particularly fond of the

6898.8 --> 6902.719
management

6900.56 --> 6905.92
if you know what i mean they're kind of

6902.719 --> 6908.96
creepy in certain things

6905.92 --> 6911.36
but as a as a utility

6908.96 --> 6913.76
online you did i think it's great works

6911.36 --> 6915.839999999999
great haven't had much trouble with it

6913.76 --> 6915.84
at

6916.84 --> 6923.360000000001
all 10 years ago it was even better then

6919.84 --> 6923.360000000001
it was like really quick

6923.44 --> 6927.44
and they didn't take any money out of it

6927.52 --> 6932.320000000001
ebay sales indeed right

6930.159 --> 6935.5199999999995
well it's still okay it's it's not what

6932.32 --> 6935.5199999999995
it used to be but yeah

6936.719 --> 6940.0
uh

6938.32 --> 6941.84
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

6940.0 --> 6945.88
show

6941.84 --> 6945.88
it's been going for a while

6962.08 --> 6964.639
okay that's interesting seeking star

6963.679 --> 6967.28
wars

6964.639 --> 6969.4400000000005
what when you understand them they don't

6967.28 --> 6973.48
manipulate you what

6969.44 --> 6973.48
what is that reference to

6976.639 --> 6980.159000000001
hmm

6977.92 --> 6982.4
it's kind of true as a rule of fist

6980.159 --> 6982.4
right

6982.8 --> 6987.4800000000005
you can't overcome what you don't

6984.48 --> 6987.48
understand

6997.76 --> 7002.04
oh symbology redwood right

7007.44 --> 7010.44
um

7021.84 --> 7026.0
right

7023.599 --> 7026.0
anyway

7026.88 --> 7031.84
i am rounding out

7029.04 --> 7033.76
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

7031.84 --> 7036.2390000000005
liked this show i thought it was pretty

7033.76 --> 7038.0
good nice and fluid

7036.239 --> 7041.119
been all over the place with subjects

7038.0 --> 7043.679
again today kind of like yesterday it

7041.119 --> 7046.0
the one thing about the one big downside

7043.679 --> 7048.32
about shows like this sometimes is that

7046.0 --> 7050.48
the subjects are so incredibly over the

7048.32 --> 7052.48
place you just can't make a coherent

7050.48 --> 7056.0
title out of it at all

7052.48 --> 7056.0
that's really my biggest problem

7056.56 --> 7060.400000000001
like jumps from one

7058.48 --> 7062.239
detailed subject to a completely

7060.4 --> 7064.159
different one and then to another one

7062.239 --> 7065.678999999999
and then to like how do you freaking

7064.159 --> 7066.799999999999
make a title out of that that makes

7065.679 --> 7068.4
sense

7066.8 --> 7070.88
that's really tough

7068.4 --> 7073.119
right i only really get the good titles

7070.88 --> 7074.88
out of it when like the entire show is

7073.119 --> 7077.28
roughly in one

7074.88 --> 7080.8
maybe two one and a half subjects and

7077.28 --> 7084.88
then it's good and easy to make a title

7080.8 --> 7087.4400000000005
but yeah it's not working out every time

7084.88 --> 7089.679
anyway if you like this show too

7087.44 --> 7091.678999999999
