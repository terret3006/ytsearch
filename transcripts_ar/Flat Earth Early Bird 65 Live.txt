the thousand subscriber mark and I was

27.0 --> 31.109
able to ask for

28.619 --> 34.82
well basically basically initiate the

31.109 --> 37.410000000000004
monetization process so yay it worked

34.82 --> 42.980000000000004

42.98 --> 50.25
yeah check if you're still subscribe

47.52 --> 52.649
because they might just wanna push it a

50.25 --> 56.519999999999996
little bit more to keep it over that

52.649 --> 59.160000000000004
thousand for a while and then yeah at

56.52 --> 62.910000000000004

over the minimum so that's cool that's

62.91 --> 70.77
cool so yeah thank you everyone and

67.38 --> 75.27
especially Randy Flat Earth he's helped

70.77 --> 76.11
me so much and also Nathan yeah you guys

75.27 --> 78.63
have been great

76.11 --> 81.36

78.63 --> 83.88
lot of good tips even up to a year ago

81.36 --> 88.049
and I wasn't really ready for it back

83.88 --> 92.90899999999999
then and yeah you gave me the time I

88.049 --> 94.799
need needed to get there and yeah thank

92.909 --> 97.409

really really appreciate it and I am

107.89 --> 121.11
exhilarated by all of this it's nice

115.8 --> 121.11
it's very nice gives me hope and

121.649 --> 131.83
simultaneously my god

123.28 --> 134.14
what is happening out there I seem to be

131.83 --> 136.9
having trouble finding some kind of

134.14 --> 139.69
restful moment because now suddenly so

136.9 --> 142.23000000000002
much is happening everywhere I go it's

139.69 --> 147.13
just overwhelming a bit I guess yeah

142.23 --> 149.47
things go good then things go good so

147.13 --> 152.53
what I'm talking about is a certain

149.47 --> 156.959
program that I was watching on the Dutch

152.53 --> 161.05
television channel the second one and

156.959 --> 163.239
was a documentary where a guy was

161.05 --> 168.19
basically explaining to an audience in

163.239 --> 171.07
detail about societal design and how

168.19 --> 172.959
people are programmed to think and what

171.07 --> 175.39
the benefits of this are and the

172.959 --> 181.17000000000002
detriments and how that develops the

175.39 --> 183.97
society and wow that's exactly what I

181.17 --> 185.55999999999997
love to talk about it was amazing and

183.97 --> 187.75
some of the Dutch television and had a

185.56 --> 191.079
wide audience so yeah there is interest

187.75 --> 194.17
in this kind of stuff and I'm I'm heart

191.079 --> 197.049
warmed that there are still that that

194.17 --> 201.08999999999997
that society seems to be ready to learn

197.049 --> 204.22
about this it's a sign of maturing

201.09 --> 207.78
spiritual maturing it's very happy about

204.22 --> 211.39
that so let's see where this goes and

207.78 --> 216.609
yeah again yes I went to the coffee shop

211.39 --> 219.39
and bumped into some guys just went over

216.609 --> 225.19
there sat there like really Dutch guys

219.39 --> 229.05999999999997
blond guys like between their 30s and

225.19 --> 230.769
40s something I think and yeah we

229.06 --> 232.87
started we started off talking they were

230.769 --> 236.709
starting talking about economics oh yeah

232.87 --> 239.199
I had my angle and explained about

236.709 --> 242.44
societal design pretty much this kind of

239.199 --> 243.79000000000002
stuff and then nitrated to the mud flood

242.44 --> 246.82
and they hadn't heard about this before

243.79 --> 249.29899999999998
really cool stuff so I explained yeah

246.82 --> 254.44
whatever I come across the channels the

249.299 --> 256.299
pictures the the half-sunken old cities

254.44 --> 258.1
how old the old cities even in the

256.299 --> 260.40999999999997
Netherlands are like half they have this

258.1 --> 265.09000000000003
half floor half sunk into street level

260.41 --> 266.83000000000004
why put everything together for them in

265.09 --> 269.19899999999996
a clearer picture also gave them my

266.83 --> 272.40999999999997
channel and said yeah I do a daily show

269.199 --> 275.11
two o'clock so Luca find me there if you

272.41 --> 277.75
want to learn more and they were very

275.11 --> 281.08000000000004
interested and so yeah I kept on talking

277.75 --> 285.85
do my thing and then eventually ended up

281.08 --> 288.13
at a point like yeah I asked so yeah you

285.85 --> 290.85
clearly seem to understand the lots and

288.13 --> 293.02
also about conspiracy in life so yeah

290.85 --> 296.5
how far do you go

293.02 --> 298.24
one guy was kind of sitting there potted

296.5 --> 300.61
up with this energy I recognized he was

298.24 --> 303.46000000000004
very nervous and being very silent like

300.61 --> 304.36
waiting for something so this guy I knew

303.46 --> 306.599
yeah I know

304.36 --> 310.71000000000004
oh this is going to be one isn't he and

306.599 --> 318.33
so I asked this question and he said

310.71 --> 321.43
well Flat Earth so I was like new hits

318.33 --> 325.08
fist bump there's a flat earther out

321.43 --> 328.09000000000003
there and he actually he said it I

325.08 --> 331.09
didn't have to even bring it up he said

328.09 --> 334.08
it was awesome meeting a Dutch flat

331.09 --> 336.63899999999995
earther and didn't really talk about it

334.08 --> 339.06899999999996
elaborately after that point but yeah he

336.639 --> 341.05
came with it I don't even know what it

339.069 --> 343.36
stands was maybe it was very skeptical

341.05 --> 345.94
or just really newly into this trying to

343.36 --> 351.099
figure it out but he was he was going

345.94 --> 355.12
there and great it's really encouraging

351.099 --> 358.469
to see that there are some people really

355.12 --> 361.33
digging into the reality of things and

358.469 --> 363.669
now yeah they may have another subject

361.33 --> 365.919
the mud flood total yeah that's right

363.669 --> 367.81
pretty much parallel to flatter than

365.919 --> 369.669
some of them are flat earthers and some

367.81 --> 372.789
of them are absolutely not flat earthers

369.669 --> 375.81899999999996
try to avoid it but yeah these are

372.789 --> 377.529
historical things that are left out of

375.819 --> 383.55
history books and they even explained

377.529 --> 383.55
why how do you know and

384.04 --> 394.45000000000005
fascinating subject I'm really getting a

387.19 --> 397.36
very clear picture now of just what

394.45 --> 399.94
really happened back then in those years

397.36 --> 401.71000000000004
of the mud flood and after that when all

399.94 --> 404.05
the kingdoms formed and I'm starting to

401.71 --> 407.65
get a very clear clear-cut picture of

404.05 --> 415.05
what have really happened and I do think

407.65 --> 418.53999999999996
that the nobility the royalty conspired

415.05 --> 420.58
against the world at that moment during

418.54 --> 424.06
the mud flood they may have seen it

420.58 --> 427.40999999999997
coming they may have actually be part be

424.06 --> 432.28000000000003
partially responsible for causing it by

427.41 --> 436.93
sabotaging the authoritarian systems who

432.28 --> 437.90999999999997
knows who knows how would we ever find

436.93 --> 440.14
out

437.91 --> 442.06
yeah that's would be the first thing

440.14 --> 445.65999999999997
that erased every single trace of

442.06 --> 447.58
historically so but yeah it's very

445.66 --> 449.23
likely that they would have and then

447.58 --> 450.94
after the mud flood happened they

449.23 --> 453.43
basically took control and they said

450.94 --> 456.4
okay this is a sign of God and we're

453.43 --> 459.82
gonna rebuild it using all these modern

456.4 --> 464.71
modern thinking and newer ways to do

459.82 --> 466.65999999999997
things and first well all the people

464.71 --> 468.03999999999996
that fell victim because of it much love

466.66 --> 470.91
the ones that survived were probably

468.04 --> 475.75
rallied against the remaining Tartarian

470.91 --> 478.15000000000003
strongholds which have been

475.75 --> 483.039
mythologically apparently explained as

478.15 --> 484.92999999999995
the barbarian stormed them well yeah

483.039 --> 486.06899999999996
they're sad if there had been a month

484.93 --> 488.74
lot yeah there would be a lot of people

486.069 --> 490.24
that just like yeah everything is ruined

488.74 --> 492.129
who's to blame

490.24 --> 494.74
well the tert Aryans is their devices

492.129 --> 497.22900000000004
that caused all this and the noble and

494.74 --> 500.979
nobility would have been pushing them to

497.229 --> 504.729
do this and then after that is over take

500.979 --> 511.349
control over the world it makes so much

504.729 --> 511.349
sense it's amazing so yeah

513.65 --> 530.05
anyway single the people looking in chat

518.71 --> 535.3000000000001
see Voynich channel JJ had hoarders TC

530.05 --> 535.3
birthday Charlie Nick

535.91 --> 540.0799999999999
see grantee Flat Earth of course

537.83 --> 544.34
righteous force rotc

540.08 --> 550.97
Rizla dan winfield chocolate sayin could

544.34 --> 553.64
see you chris matt sassy looming right

550.97 --> 559.0400000000001
now saucy love the mud flood was

553.64 --> 562.43
probably everywhere but the core of the

559.04 --> 566.15
tartarean empire was probably Eastern

562.43 --> 569.0899999999999
Europe and North Russia and Alaska but

566.15 --> 572.03
they would because they were such a

569.09 --> 574.37
mighty group of people they will have

572.03 --> 578.4399999999999
been involved in the entire world and

574.37 --> 581.39
just built their stuff at springing up

578.44 --> 585.1400000000001
fortresses and civilizations across the

581.39 --> 589.6
world including America and that's what

585.14 --> 591.67
I think are you doing now in any ranty

589.6 --> 596.39
way

591.67 --> 599.9599999999999
999 young ones play in the game mate

596.39 --> 602.21
someone's playing the game I know the

599.96 --> 606.6800000000001
good thing is you had the thousand of

602.21 --> 608.87
one before 988 so essentially he was

606.68 --> 611.81
still able to put in for monetization so

608.87 --> 612.5600000000001
it's a process it takes time so it

611.81 --> 614.81
doesn't really matter

612.56 --> 616.9699999999999
stick to things look at the trolls that

614.81 --> 619.01
are obviously under stubbing you just to

616.97 --> 620.69
try and keep you at now announcing them

619.01 --> 621.74
to stress you out you don't need to do

620.69 --> 626.96
it because you've already put your

621.74 --> 629.3
application in so [ __ ] you okay it's

626.96 --> 632.4200000000001
alright it's just it's gonna probably

629.3 --> 635.02
keep on swinging I just hope that it

632.42 --> 637.4599999999999
will eventually stay above the thousand

635.02 --> 639.29
but I don't know if it even matters

637.46 --> 641.1800000000001
anymore for them if they even look at

639.29 --> 642.68
that or if they're just gonna look at

641.18 --> 645.4399999999999
the viewing hours because if they do

642.68 --> 647.9
that and yeah I'm I'm gonna be green to

645.44 --> 651.37
go anyway

647.9 --> 653.15
got more than 150% of one is required

651.37 --> 654.89
yeah you'll be good to go

653.15 --> 656.87
I know you just dropped another

654.89 --> 658.49
subscribe and now it's no good though

656.87 --> 660.589
it doesn't make any difference you'll

658.49 --> 663.35
already hit it and what would happening

660.589 --> 664.6400000000001
over at jaren's before I know you that

663.35 --> 666.529
you've picked up four out sixty

664.64 --> 669.68
subscribers since that video was put out

666.529 --> 671.54
what yes sir yes six hours ago so I

669.68 --> 673.9399999999999
imagine by the end of the day anyway

671.54 --> 677.5889999999999
you'll still get over the thousand so

673.94 --> 681.2790000000001
it's not an issue indeed

677.589 --> 683.6
doesn't be balanced that's what they do

681.279 --> 686.12
they're just what they're trying to do

683.6 --> 688.46
is see you triggered I know in a

686.12 --> 694.4
previous I don't work out I'm way to a

688.46 --> 696.83
euphoric to me trigger no but like

694.4 --> 699.7099999999999
there's this subscriber barrier that's

696.83 --> 703.58
something to be happy about for me but

699.71 --> 706.85
also just things are just turning the

703.58 --> 708.4100000000001
energy has been up around me I feel a

706.85 --> 711.44
lot more stable and I meet these people

708.41 --> 713.77
now it's just life is awesome at the

711.44 --> 713.7700000000001
moment

714.46 --> 719.44
so I know she was talking about the

716.41 --> 721.63
tartarean yes have you been watching

719.44 --> 731.1400000000001
Martin lately of course I have and

721.63 --> 733.54
others yeah what you ap know was

731.14 --> 736.42
probably not that I hold on I'll check

733.54 --> 739.4699999999999
out the name of the channel was I

736.42 --> 739.4699999999999
subscribed to it

754.51 --> 766.6899999999999
Wow didn't pop up that is so annoying it

763.269 --> 769.92
refuses to review itself in my list so

766.69 --> 769.9200000000001
and I have to look back

777.28 --> 790.03
Oh age of disclosure that was the

782.2 --> 791.2900000000001
channel AOD you know the channel yeah

790.03 --> 793.9
he's been going about three years I

791.29 --> 797.1999999999999
wasn't sick yes are you so you know him

793.9 --> 799.93
right yeah I discovered one of those one

797.2 --> 804.76
of his videos yesterday talked about it

799.93 --> 808.2399999999999
and yeah the parallels Martin Letus work

804.76 --> 810.49
and maybe even refines a little upon it

808.24 --> 813.13
and it inspired me greatly to think

810.49 --> 816.3100000000001
about it and thus now I have my own

813.13 --> 820.09
theories of what exactly happened during

816.31 --> 822.91
that time what do you think what do you

820.09 --> 826.5400000000001
think happened then I win right well I

822.91 --> 829.86
think that there were the tert Aryans in

826.54 --> 833.62
their original Empire Eastern Europe

829.86 --> 836.8000000000001
northern Russia and Alaska that's where

833.62 --> 838.3
their their homeland was as it were but

836.8 --> 840.4
they did spread out pretty much

838.3 --> 843.3389999999999
everywhere in the world got involved in

840.4 --> 845.98
societies build buildings for those

843.339 --> 852.3000000000001
societies and built the fortresses star

845.98 --> 856.51
fortress and then the nobility of Europe

852.3 --> 859.63
either sabotaged their electrical

856.51 --> 861.55
systems to overload it causing ice caps

859.63 --> 863.92
of that miniature ice age that was

861.55 --> 866.5
present right there to melt and cause

863.92 --> 869.4399999999999
the mud flood or it happened by itself

866.5 --> 875.02
accidentally and then the nobility

869.44 --> 880.9000000000001
conspired ahead of time to get the while

875.02 --> 883.18
they did to get the survivors of this

880.9 --> 885.0699999999999
mud flood rallied up against the tert

883.18 --> 887.38
Aryans and blamed them so they would

885.07 --> 889.2700000000001
like barbarian storm them kind of

887.38 --> 892.48
similar to the Lord of the Rings set up

889.27 --> 893.38
where Saruman basically turns the the

892.48 --> 896.9200000000001
wild folk

893.38 --> 899.14
against Rohan that kind of setup that's

896.92 --> 901.5999999999999
what the nobility probably did and then

899.14 --> 904.18
after it they carved up Europe in the

901.6 --> 907.66
new kingdoms

904.18 --> 909.93
and took everything over and started up

907.66 --> 917.0799999999999
their whole conquering of America plan

909.93 --> 919.42
and everything yeah okay it's

917.08 --> 921.88
interesting it's not where my thoughts

919.42 --> 924.279
are though I mean I know Martin's been

921.88 --> 926.32
talking about some kind of technology

924.279 --> 928.56
that was able to create these multiples

926.32 --> 935.49
as opposed to it actually being a

928.56 --> 935.4899999999999
melting of the ice house but but how

937.23 --> 945.01
frequency waves right but yeah you can

942.13 --> 946.959
do so many things with them see so a

945.01 --> 950.529
device that would be used to just

946.959 --> 954.31
enhance life or create local heat or

950.529 --> 956.8
could then perhaps be sabotaged put in a

954.31 --> 959.02
mode where it would cause this could be

956.8 --> 963.16
wood could be kind of similar setup

959.02 --> 966.49
either it's that like a giant mishap of

963.16 --> 968.3199999999999
the technology maybe also through

966.49 --> 971.74
sabotage or by accident who knows

968.32 --> 973.9590000000001
probably sabotage if it was that or it

971.74 --> 977.89
could have been the miniaturize age and

973.959 --> 980.3199999999999
then the the molten ice caps broke

977.89 --> 982.9
through and caused the 12 meter of water

980.32 --> 987.4000000000001
everywhere that eventually resided but

982.9 --> 990.1899999999999
they left a lot of mud so it could be

987.4 --> 992.98
either one I think that if there was a

990.19 --> 995.44
frequency catastrophe and everything

992.98 --> 998.22
turned to mud that a lot more buildings

995.44 --> 1000.7790000000001
and everything would probably be sinking

998.22 --> 1002.97
asymmetrically because of this they

1000.779 --> 1006.9
would become raggedy they wouldn't be

1002.97 --> 1009.2090000000001
straight while a flood flooding over it

1006.9 --> 1011.67
and the land remaining what it is the

1009.209 --> 1013.68
rock underneath there's more more likely

1011.67 --> 1017.31
to keep everything pretty much straight

1013.68 --> 1020.25
and just put on a layer of mud so I'm

1017.31 --> 1023.16
not too sure about

1020.25 --> 1027.63
it the much love being directly caused

1023.16 --> 1029.49
by by earth the disruption because that

1027.63 --> 1034.22
would cause a lot more Cataclysm

1029.49 --> 1036.78
probably that's how I think about it

1034.22 --> 1038.13
well I suppose it all depends on the how

1036.78 --> 1042.3
advanced that is these civilizations

1038.13 --> 1048.7800000000002
were very advanced they were masters of

1042.3 --> 1054.53
this what do you think about these star

1048.78 --> 1058.58
falls on its master ash architecture

1054.53 --> 1060.98
using utilizing all the architecture of

1058.58 --> 1065.9399999999998
what they knew

1060.98 --> 1070.56
using the ether designing it in certain

1065.94 --> 1074.97
patterns that had effects on the area so

1070.56 --> 1077.19
yeah it's all tartarean is it true that

1074.97 --> 1084.42
Berlin is actually situated in one

1077.19 --> 1090.8700000000001
massive star for my well only one way to

1084.42 --> 1096.24
find out I think these do the Berlin Zoo

1090.87 --> 1098.55
is definitely inside a star for yes they

1096.24 --> 1101.07
say that the animals there and the

1098.55 --> 1103.62
plants and all everything that's in the

1101.07 --> 1106.74
inhabitants inside that everything seems

1103.62 --> 1108.8999999999999
to be more relaxed I don't know if

1106.74 --> 1111.26
that's true but this is what they this

1108.9 --> 1115.5300000000002
is what's been said I believe it

1111.26 --> 1117.36
absolutely okay looking at the map of

1115.53 --> 1122.43
Berlin I wouldn't say that this is

1117.36 --> 1126.4399999999998
exactly a star for it but yeah the

1122.43 --> 1126.44
Berlin Zoo yeah that could be

1132.37 --> 1138.2299999999998
apparently Voynich channel says that the

1135.8 --> 1144.43
Vatican is founded in one of these Star

1138.23 --> 1144.43
Wars no doubt

1150.17 --> 1155.48
no wait this may be a new Berlin Zoo or

1153.98 --> 1158.6
is it still the old one because I don't

1155.48 --> 1161.0
see a star fort right here makes you

1158.6 --> 1166.2099999999998
wonder why they flattened Berlin during

1161.0 --> 1173.36
World War two right why they flattened

1166.21 --> 1175.45
London in World War two strong the

1173.36 --> 1175.4499999999998
evidence

1183.46 --> 1189.07
it's all a it's a multi-layered chess

1186.88 --> 1191.0800000000002
game that's how I see they do things

1189.07 --> 1194.32
it's like on the one hand there is the

1191.08 --> 1197.1599999999999
political situation and then there is

1194.32 --> 1201.3999999999999
the backdrop secret plan of

1197.16 --> 1205.0
piece-by-piece destroying history to

1201.4 --> 1209.17
reinforce their conspiring history

1205.0 --> 1212.8
narrative yeah I mean I have to be after

1209.17 --> 1216.16
I mean I've seen these people you know

1212.8 --> 1218.97
like Isis running around pulling down

1216.16 --> 1223.3000000000002
statues temples destroying stuff that

1218.97 --> 1224.92
and it makes my blood boil I can tell

1223.3 --> 1228.07
you I mean it's the one thing that

1224.92 --> 1230.89
absolutely triggers me something rotten

1228.07 --> 1232.84
is to see these people that have no

1230.89 --> 1236.47
respect for something that has been

1232.84 --> 1238.4199999999998
around for thousands of years that has

1236.47 --> 1240.55
meant so much to so many people over

1238.42 --> 1242.5
such a long time and some prick things

1240.55 --> 1243.01
that can just go along and within ten

1242.5 --> 1245.8
minutes

1243.01 --> 1249.34
destroy it completely right absolutely

1245.8 --> 1251.47
honestly I mean the whole a [ __ ] you're

1249.34 --> 1254.23
triggering me right now by the memory I

1251.47 --> 1257.98
remember them blowing up those statues

1254.23 --> 1261.21
seeing that and yeah that made me like

1257.98 --> 1264.73
okay this this culture must be destroyed

1261.21 --> 1269.53
you know this is this is classic

1264.73 --> 1272.92
barbarism must be annihilated but yeah

1269.53 --> 1274.78
on the other hand now look that's but

1272.92 --> 1278.3500000000001
there is another thing to it and that is

1274.78 --> 1282.52
the realization right now that these

1278.35 --> 1285.52
things can be restored pretty no almost

1282.52 --> 1289.06
as was yes it can that the technology

1285.52 --> 1291.22
that was used to make this is still in

1289.06 --> 1294.94
existence and it's probably very easy

1291.22 --> 1297.91
but yeah they can't openly at this

1294.94 --> 1301.24
current time reveal that like oh yeah we

1297.91 --> 1303.6000000000001
can just make rebuild an entire thing in

1301.24 --> 1306.55
two days no problem

1303.6 --> 1309.28
they can probably do that they're just

1306.55 --> 1313.6299999999999
not doing it because they may they want

1309.28 --> 1316.83
to push on us this conflict of us

1313.63 --> 1321.19
needing to protect the past and all that

1316.83 --> 1324.76
it's it's so complicated really when you

1321.19 --> 1326.44
you put in all the hidden things then it

1324.76 --> 1328.51
becomes much more complicated but they

1326.44 --> 1330.73
could restore it they're not probably

1328.51 --> 1334.87
not gonna but if we take back control

1330.73 --> 1338.17
and if we regain these technologies for

1334.87 --> 1340.33
the public then yeah societies can

1338.17 --> 1341.44
decide okay let's just restore the

1340.33 --> 1341.8899999999999
damage here and there and there and

1341.44 --> 1343.71
there

1341.89 --> 1346.45
maybe make something new here and there

1343.71 --> 1349.06
it could be done but yeah that would be

1346.45 --> 1351.8500000000001
like a Golden Age moment for Western

1349.06 --> 1354.04
society if that were to happen and maybe

1351.85 --> 1356.58
the rest of the world we'd have to get

1354.04 --> 1356.58
there first

1360.64 --> 1365.8300000000002
yeah I'm quite positive about that

1363.769 --> 1367.77
really

1365.83 --> 1372.1789999999999
you know

1367.77 --> 1374.01
there's of course the thing that the

1372.179 --> 1375.99
real artifact about it

1374.01 --> 1378.809
the thing that is really extremely old

1375.99 --> 1383.46
yeah it can never be exactly what it was

1378.809 --> 1387.72
but it can be restored almost exactly as

1383.46 --> 1389.49
was more isn't that the existence of it

1387.72 --> 1392.16
in our consciousness the thing that is

1389.49 --> 1397.65
the real value of it not the material

1392.16 --> 1400.3500000000001
itself really yeah nothing noon

1397.65 --> 1406.65
yeah it's morning for me it's 721 a.m.

1400.35 --> 1408.1789999999999
for me anything new anything you just

1406.65 --> 1411.1200000000001
got a Florrick I got a couple little

1408.179 --> 1415.2800000000002
videos foolish that I took do it in the

1411.12 --> 1424.9799999999998
last week but pretty cool stuff well

1415.28 --> 1429.059
check my subscribers guys 950 990 I know

1424.98 --> 1434.96
wow you know who subscribed to me last

1429.059 --> 1434.96
night run t go on Chris monk silly

1436.16 --> 1442.41
that's probably well well he check on my

1439.559 --> 1444.78
last video I posted one boat get in

1442.41 --> 1446.8500000000001
getting obstructed as he goes to the

1444.78 --> 1449.19
distance but the obstruction is they

1446.85 --> 1452.79
they move a inferior Mirage and they are

1449.19 --> 1455.22
there and then mirror in zone and he say

1452.79 --> 1458.1
like excellent globe proof I go like

1455.22 --> 1461.1000000000001
what and he replied back if I check on

1458.1 --> 1463.7099999999998
this timestamp is in the comment section

1461.1 --> 1465.3899999999999
you're gonna see a small white boat in

1463.71 --> 1467.55
front of it and it's not getting me

1465.39 --> 1470.49
right she do a little explanation the

1467.55 --> 1472.3799999999999
world you know little play of words it's

1470.49 --> 1474.84
a like excellent globe group a Sarah all

1472.38 --> 1476.88
right okay whatever you say you know but

1474.84 --> 1481.76
and hang time then he subscribe to my

1476.88 --> 1485.99
channel about that so he said

1481.76 --> 1489.96
re-engaging so yeah he's in that boat of

1485.99 --> 1493.89
conspiracy cat and those disingenuous

1489.96 --> 1497.52
guys that take clear explanation of

1493.89 --> 1500.1190000000001
obstruction non curvature and trying to

1497.52 --> 1503.36
throw it out there presented a signal

1500.119 --> 1507.379
very yeah yeah there's there's nothing

1503.36 --> 1509.4799999999998
new with these guys or the life lights

1507.379 --> 1512.4499999999998
all the you know essentially till it's

1509.48 --> 1514.6100000000001
actually announced cuz it'll have to be

1512.45 --> 1516.8600000000001
announced at some point when it actually

1514.61 --> 1519.6789999999999
has to get announced that the earth is

1516.86 --> 1521.57
indeed product Wow

1519.679 --> 1524.1190000000001
whether that's in whether that's in 50

1521.57 --> 1526.97
years or 80 years time whenever it

1524.119 --> 1529.61
happens you know in the meantime there's

1526.97 --> 1531.07
more money in it for them to be ante

1529.61 --> 1535.4599999999998
Flat Earth so they can make more money

1531.07 --> 1540.9189999999999
being opposed to this idea rather than

1535.46 --> 1542.059
you know go with the the truth so it's

1540.919 --> 1544.6000000000001
up to them you know I mean they're just

1542.059 --> 1548.869
selling out their sellouts essentially

1544.6 --> 1553.07
the so disingenuous but on the other

1548.869 --> 1556.269
hand I think that I'm trying to be even

1553.07 --> 1560.259
more subtly the approach I think that

1556.269 --> 1562.7
they may actually never really reveal it

1560.259 --> 1564.23
literally I think they may do it the

1562.7 --> 1565.8500000000001
same way that I've been doing it because

1564.23 --> 1569.269
it just works so much better

1565.85 --> 1571.07
I reveal everything they'll leave the

1569.269 --> 1573.679
Flat Earth out just leave that one

1571.07 --> 1576.59
little bit out for people to decide

1573.679 --> 1579.3500000000001
whether they believe that or not no it's

1576.59 --> 1581.359
too hard to openly throw out there yeah

1579.35 --> 1583.9989999999998
they'll that they'll do it when every

1581.359 --> 1586.489
astronaut and every every person that

1583.999 --> 1588.23
was in the control room at NASA when all

1586.489 --> 1589.82
of those people have died every

1588.23 --> 1592.159
astronaut that went and apparently

1589.82 --> 1593.899
walked on the moon when all those people

1592.159 --> 1596.1190000000001
are died and they've gone they're no

1593.899 --> 1598.82
longer here to be questioned ridiculed

1596.119 --> 1601.07
or quiz that's when they will announce

1598.82 --> 1602.9289999999999
it the car announced it before then yeah

1601.07 --> 1604.9089999999999
but that's the reason I'm moving back to

1602.929 --> 1606.679
the moon are they gonna announce that

1604.909 --> 1608.8690000000001
the moon landings didn't happen when

1606.679 --> 1611.0590000000002
that happens yeah the Flat Earth is

1608.869 --> 1613.639
another thing but look with revised

1611.059 --> 1615.499
history now already finding its way in

1613.639 --> 1619.2489999999998
the sub mainstream in the alternative

1615.499 --> 1621.259
media okay that is such a took the mud

1619.249 --> 1624.08
flood in all alternative history that is

1621.259 --> 1626.539
just as big a subject on its own as Flat

1624.08 --> 1629.119
Earth is yeah and that's already making

1626.539 --> 1630.21
so much head weight and that's a clear

1629.119 --> 1633.029
signal

1630.21 --> 1637.6190000000001
that there is a transformation happening

1633.029 --> 1643.289
and yeah they may just let it become

1637.619 --> 1646.379
popular culture and do whatever you know

1643.289 --> 1650.46
just let it happen it's okay but they'll

1646.379 --> 1652.4699999999998
still officially uphold a kind of globe

1650.46 --> 1653.6000000000001
narrative maybe or they'll just stop

1652.47 --> 1656.34
talking about it

1653.6 --> 1658.4699999999998
but they're not gonna say yeah guys the

1656.34 --> 1661.289
earth is actually a flat maybe more

1658.47 --> 1664.169
comedians will do this because that's

1661.289 --> 1667.879
typically the place to do that but like

1664.169 --> 1670.5590000000002
for serious news things no I doubt

1667.879 --> 1672.98
that's probably never gonna yield a

1670.559 --> 1675.629
result that they would be interested in

1672.98 --> 1678.1490000000001
yeah but I think these borders all of

1675.629 --> 1680.9699999999998
them most of them if not all of them

1678.149 --> 1682.9089999999999
they will change their opinion very

1680.97 --> 1686.309
strong opinion on holding onto this

1682.909 --> 1688.019
narrative and explanation about gravity

1686.309 --> 1689.94
and the measurements of the earth and

1688.019 --> 1692.009
amesh the distances to the Stars and the

1689.94 --> 1694.3200000000002
Sun and the moon only they're not gonna

1692.009 --> 1696.929
change unless is presented in mainstream

1694.32 --> 1698.759
media in the news in a big documentary

1696.929 --> 1700.47
in the movie theaters if it's not

1698.759 --> 1701.6100000000001
presented on TV I don't think they're

1700.47 --> 1703.3790000000001
gonna change their mind they're gonna

1701.61 --> 1706.309
stay with the same emotion they're

1703.379 --> 1708.629
wearing on that on the TV to tell them

1706.309 --> 1710.789
you know let you guys know that I've

1708.629 --> 1714.57
I've been contacted by somebody that

1710.789 --> 1717.059
wants to do a documentary on flat of

1714.57 --> 1721.59
this but he's gonna do it in a style of

1717.059 --> 1724.4089999999999
either 2d and 3d animation expert who's

1721.59 --> 1729.48
been in the film industry and has done

1724.409 --> 1731.19
lots of 2d animations and videos quite

1729.48 --> 1733.679
popular and he's been in touch with me

1731.19 --> 1735.45
directly and wants to work with me later

1733.679 --> 1740.22
on in the year to put something together

1735.45 --> 1742.3
hmm awesome Congrats it couldn't I'd

1740.22 --> 1746.38
love to get involved

1742.3 --> 1747.85
I'm welcomed yeah he's interested is

1746.38 --> 1752.71
definitely interested in the story

1747.85 --> 1754.87
that's for sure he wants to put a short

1752.71 --> 1757.54
video or maybe even a long documentary

1754.87 --> 1759.01
together wasn't decided yet but we're in

1757.54 --> 1762.3899999999999
preliminary talks about it right now

1759.01 --> 1766.42
yeah let's make it a 12-minute video

1762.39 --> 1770.17
because pretty cool Congrats man he

1766.42 --> 1772.42
tells a lot you know that if important

1770.17 --> 1775.0
eyes are are paying attention today to

1772.42 --> 1778.03
the work that is being presented and and

1775.0 --> 1780.52
documented over here congrats me know

1778.03 --> 1784.54
it's more of the fact that if somebody

1780.52 --> 1786.82
feels something like this and puts it

1784.54 --> 1788.86
out there then it's going to be massive

1786.82 --> 1791.02
or flat that's not is it's not all about

1788.86 --> 1797.05
me it's about the obviously getting the

1791.02 --> 1798.82
word out so no oh god no yeah that's

1797.05 --> 1802.48
what I'm being a congrat because you are

1798.82 --> 1805.06
a I think the right person to present if

1802.48 --> 1806.41
it's about graphics and you know some

1805.06 --> 1808.81
kind of documentary that was gonna

1806.41 --> 1811.3600000000001
present in some kind of modeling in

1808.81 --> 1813.22
quotes you're a you're a good person to

1811.36 --> 1816.31
base it around because you got a

1813.22 --> 1819.52
shitload of observations good base in

1816.31 --> 1822.31
these in this phenomena of optics you

1819.52 --> 1824.92
know so congrats I say that there are

1822.31 --> 1827.26
important eyes on you and on you I mean

1824.92 --> 1828.8200000000002
them on all of us that are doing of

1827.26 --> 1832.18
Soviet your soul yeah I did good stuff

1828.82 --> 1836.6499999999999
man I'm happy about yeah yesterday I'm

1832.18 --> 1840.19
quite sure I'm quite excited actually as

1836.65 --> 1843.6000000000001
well so it's flying all the later in the

1840.19 --> 1843.6000000000001
air to discuss it

1844.96 --> 1850.0900000000001
good stuff did you see my video of the

1847.52 --> 1854.45
birds I think I put about a week ago I

1850.09 --> 1857.99
called the birds birds disappearing or

1854.45 --> 1862.22
flying in the me right zone in the

1857.99 --> 1864.02
refraction zone or Dawson's a Dawson's

1862.22 --> 1866.42
[ __ ] there are thousands of birds

1864.02 --> 1868.61
right in the sweet spot they're flying

1866.42 --> 1871.22
from left to right like one after

1868.61 --> 1873.53
another but they are flying right in the

1871.22 --> 1873.92
spot where they they are Mirel up and

1873.53 --> 1875.18
down

1873.92 --> 1877.43
where they're flying and you see the

1875.18 --> 1880.79
reflection underneath and then a little

1877.43 --> 1882.8600000000001
wave of birds go up like they start

1880.79 --> 1885.1399999999999
flying up up up up and then they start

1882.86 --> 1887.9599999999998
diving down and as they dive down they

1885.14 --> 1890.5400000000002
disappeared in the horizon like this

1887.96 --> 1893.96
like really low to the water bro is

1890.54 --> 1896.12
beautiful beautiful Taylor get mean yeah

1893.96 --> 1899.39
I've got that on the time-lapse video

1896.12 --> 1902.06
that I put out I have the same thing you

1899.39 --> 1903.95
see you know the mirror image of the

1902.06 --> 1906.8
bird that's flying and literally its

1903.95 --> 1908.3
crest in the the ocean so you've either

1906.8 --> 1910.01
going to believe its crest of the ocean

1908.3 --> 1911.87
or is actually in the atmosphere and we

1910.01 --> 1914.36
know what the answer is so we know it's

1911.87 --> 1918.5
not lying on the water guys show don't

1914.36 --> 1920.6
tell if you you're you're welcome to

1918.5 --> 1924.65
present some of these pictures here on

1920.6 --> 1927.23
the show put your present mode if you

1924.65 --> 1931.0
have them available yeah I mean I don't

1927.23 --> 1934.73
yeah if I post if I copy I pasted the

1931.0 --> 1936.86
video on skype or I mean you see there

1934.73 --> 1938.57
you are winning my shot and if you want

1936.86 --> 1942.62
to present one of mine so Randy because

1938.57 --> 1947.24
I'm on my phone I mean I can I'm on a

1942.62 --> 1949.01
little tablet as well so it's so when

1947.24 --> 1951.11
you're gonna have to do it yeah I mean

1949.01 --> 1953.78
you're welcome money in and some of

1951.11 --> 1956.36
these days if you see that I post a new

1953.78 --> 1958.31
video or at least myself now from

1956.36 --> 1960.2299999999998
yourself and you liked it and you find

1958.31 --> 1962.03
it interesting presenter even if I'm not

1960.23 --> 1963.6200000000001
in the show because there gonna be some

1962.03 --> 1965.78
days that my schedule is gonna be really

1963.62 --> 1966.9799999999998
long and I might upload a good video

1965.78 --> 1969.62
that you like if you want to present

1966.98 --> 1971.6
that go for it I mean for real I did not

1969.62 --> 1973.6999999999998
bother me it makes me happy that people

1971.6 --> 1976.09
you know presents my videos even if I

1973.7 --> 1977.8300000000002
don't know about it you know

1976.09 --> 1980.77
that's fine and I will definitely

1977.83 --> 1983.98
reference certain events like for

1980.77 --> 1985.779
example the Pancho train thing so I will

1983.98 --> 1989.32
absolutely reference you and maybe even

1985.779 --> 1991.539
demonstrate it but I just like it more

1989.32 --> 1994.45
if you guys start talking about this to

1991.539 --> 1996.61
just show some of it because yeah that

1994.45 --> 2002.7
makes the experience a lot better

1996.61 --> 2009.99
oh yeah yeah so yeah I can't find it any

2002.7 --> 2020.7
of your videos in the master B or

2009.99 --> 2021.45
somewhere oh no this babe before that

2020.7 --> 2025.919
it's called

2021.45 --> 2031.01
Birds it starts with birds it's like

2025.919 --> 2031.01
four three or four five videos ago

2037.12 --> 2044.9699999999998
all right okay yeah

2051.74 --> 2058.5499999999997
trying to find it okay which one was

2054.47 --> 2061.4599999999996
with the birds all right there are the

2058.55 --> 2064.3100000000004
last three awry I uploaded his boat

2061.46 --> 2064.73
I say part 1 part 2 and part 3 of the

2064.31 --> 2066.859
boat

2064.73 --> 2069.169
I see if I'm not mistaking it before

2066.859 --> 2072.609
though after that one there birds flying

2069.169 --> 2078.9089999999997
in and out of the refraction zone yes

2072.609 --> 2082.73
okay good yeah I start recording on a

2078.909 --> 2085.4900000000002
recorder like maybe 10 minutes video and

2082.73 --> 2088.19
I compiled it in in just three or four

2085.49 --> 2090.4399999999996
minutes I took two parts you know like a

2088.19 --> 2093.109
minute and a half first and then like

2090.44 --> 2095.27
two minutes second half and I put it

2093.109 --> 2097.2
together but take a look this really

2095.27 --> 2102.449
gets there

2097.2 --> 2102.4489999999996
[Music]

2121.38 --> 2124.4790000000003
[Applause]

2127.64 --> 2130.81
[Music]

2150.75 --> 2170.47
behind the Hangout do you see me good

2166.51 --> 2173.9500000000003
rugby took a couple snippets of the

2170.47 --> 2181.87
video I did first minute or something

2173.95 --> 2184.39
and then I call right now in a minute is

2181.87 --> 2186.37
when they start flying open down and

2184.39 --> 2209.92
disappearing little bit like in a little

2186.37 --> 2211.75
way now look at that one that one was

2209.92 --> 2214.1800000000003
like a minute are how they start forming

2211.75 --> 2216.069
like in house

2214.18 --> 2220.359
I think there was a bad weather coming

2216.069 --> 2222.46
in they're all gone and they were always

2220.359 --> 2225.46
lowering the tweet odd because they were

2222.46 --> 2227.71
like people we were right there in that

2225.46 --> 2229.869
I Hannah she they go up fly a little

2227.71 --> 2231.609
higher than beaver stop if they go a

2229.869 --> 2237.069
little lower they will disappear you

2231.609 --> 2243.97
know they'll fly it right there oh I get

2237.069 --> 2246.549
harassed [ __ ] Birds it's beautiful I

2243.97 --> 2249.8089999999997
thought it was I mean I thought I said

2246.549 --> 2249.809
like it's dead and I get my way

2255.73 --> 2258.819
yeah there's two reference points where

2257.5 --> 2262.18
you can see that the birds are

2258.819 --> 2264.52
reflecting a lower point as opposed to

2262.18 --> 2267.1299999999997
the the boat where the inferior

2264.52 --> 2268.839
varieties is higher up on that so again

2267.13 --> 2272.559
that's just two reference points in the

2268.839 --> 2276.22
one image proving that it's it's it's an

2272.559 --> 2278.5890000000004
angle so I think in future you know

2276.22 --> 2279.7599999999998
where Jose some of the stuff we need

2278.589 --> 2281.77
because we've got the globe is on the

2279.76 --> 2282.579
run right now with this inferior Mirage

2281.77 --> 2284.859
yeah

2282.579 --> 2287.829
really on the run so if we can get more

2284.859 --> 2290.23
evidences of this they maybe even two or

2287.829 --> 2291.6090000000004
three volts in a line or a further away

2290.23 --> 2295.39
and you've got the inferior Mirage

2291.609 --> 2296.859
happening at higher point oh yes one you

2295.39 --> 2300.21
know and then you can prove that it's

2296.859 --> 2301.72
actually an angle as opposed to being a

2300.21 --> 2304.7200000000003
curvature of the earth

2301.72 --> 2306.73
I understand yeah yeah I mean we've got

2304.72 --> 2308.47
it pretty much nailed anyway I mean I've

2306.73 --> 2309.91
got so much of this stuff but just more

2308.47 --> 2311.89
people doing that kind of work this is

2309.91 --> 2313.69
what we need to do disprove this

2311.89 --> 2315.609
curvature this is disproving curve right

2313.69 --> 2318.099
now what you're showing is there's no

2315.609 --> 2322.69
evening closure you can't have this

2318.099 --> 2325.869
effect on a curve it's impossible I tell

2322.69 --> 2327.76
ya I understand yeah about the three 3d

2325.869 --> 2329.6800000000003
three balls in in different distances

2327.76 --> 2332.2000000000003
three bolts and maybe a piece of land

2329.68 --> 2334.1499999999996
further away in the back and you can see

2332.2 --> 2337.0
yeah the Mirage on going higher at the

2334.15 --> 2339.9700000000003
distance go further away and you see the

2337.0 --> 2343.539
slant effect as the floor appears to go

2339.97 --> 2346.39
up with with perspective the same as the

2343.539 --> 2352.309
de Mirage effect I understand

2346.39 --> 2354.0499999999997
ya see flying cars of them I'm gonna say

2352.309 --> 2357.44
maybe there's a little fishing boat and

2354.05 --> 2359.71
the birds behind it oh hell no no boats

2357.44 --> 2364.2200000000003
going that far

2359.71 --> 2367.0
it's a flying broomstick let me get that

2364.22 --> 2371.3799999999997
they are right right in the sweet spot

2367.0 --> 2374.39
with the mirror is going in man we're

2371.38 --> 2412.849
going in and out of that little Bluebird

2570.19 --> 2573.39
do the same thing I just literally type

2572.29 --> 2579.48
in Arwen

2573.39 --> 2579.48
look we're in this channel and click it

2580.369 --> 2589.099

nope everything seems to be in order so

2624.599 --> 2631.199
there's no reason for this to happen or

2626.91 --> 2632.67

2657.539 --> 2662.67
really fast like 10 times faster going

2660.959 --> 2664.68
forward and going back and you can see

2662.67 --> 2666.839

that bad god you guys have never not do

2947.44 --> 2955.39
it yeah listen

2952.619 --> 2960.19
living in Asia is what generally

2955.39 --> 2962.0789999999997
speaking way safer than the West just

2960.19 --> 2965.17
walking on this from like what the home

2962.079 --> 2966.88
VPN is not allowed so like what if they

2965.17 --> 2968.41
find out you're on one what are they

2966.88 --> 2972.4300000000003
gonna do they gotta send people to your

2968.41 --> 2975.609
house China has China has yeah that's

2972.43 --> 2978.16
what they do bigger fish to fry if I

2975.609 --> 2980.17
listen if I was Chinese and I was trying

2978.16 --> 2981.64
to organize about following Gong you

2980.17 --> 2983.259
know and all that stuff they ate and

2981.64 --> 2986.14
trying to get Chinese people then they

2983.259 --> 2988.57
would give a [ __ ] dude they got forget

2986.14 --> 2991.2999999999997
big a lot of people to deal with

2988.57 --> 2993.63
they don't give a [ __ ] about me not

2991.3 --> 2993.63
right now

2993.96 --> 2997.78
yeah hey what's the worst thing you do

2996.31 --> 2999.82
they can say get the [ __ ] out of China

2997.78 --> 3007.02
never come back or kill me I mean that's

2999.82 --> 3010.38
the only two options right they don't

3007.02 --> 3015.12
care about I don't know yeah I could

3010.38 --> 3019.29
speculate kind of negative not that bad

3015.12 --> 3020.5499999999997
trust me you know and I'll say that if

3019.29 --> 3022.89
you want me to give you I'll give you

3020.55 --> 3024.9
specifics about what's terrible about

3022.89 --> 3028.7
China but I'm also saying it's not

3024.9 --> 3028.7000000000003
relatively speaking it's not that bad

3029.45 --> 3036.93
what about the whole social score credit

3032.52 --> 3039.5099999999998
system that is already okay so I'm just

3036.93 --> 3042.54
saying that yeah maybe consequences to

3039.51 --> 3044.7000000000003
them taking note of you talking about

3042.54 --> 3048.0299999999997
certain subjects and might not reflect

3044.7 --> 3055.73
on you because yeah but might reflect on

3048.03 --> 3055.73
your life just saying so far so good

3057.05 --> 3061.65
wait I mean I don't want to freaking

3059.79 --> 3064.77
take over the show here so what's up

3061.65 --> 3066.39
guys hi a specifically because I haven't

3064.77 --> 3069.5099999999998
really spoken too much so I'm asking

3066.39 --> 3075.35
like I missed you guys like fans

3069.51 --> 3095.3700000000003
families pool yeah you know Chinese wife

3075.35 --> 3099.24
cold and stoic agent women are very very

3095.37 --> 3101.5499999999997
pragmatic just you know get married have

3099.24 --> 3106.83
the kid or two kids get the car get the

3101.55 --> 3110.76
house they're they're they're pragmatic

3106.83 --> 3112.94
but yeah and I mean they're not they're

3110.76 --> 3112.94
not

3113.16 --> 3119.49
it's complex they're not they're not

3116.099 --> 3121.4700000000003
westernized idiots they'll fall for our

3119.49 --> 3124.769
delusions and let themselves drown in

3121.47 --> 3127.2889999999998
that [ __ ] well they don't have let's see

3124.769 --> 3130.049
let's put it in layman's terms they

3127.289 --> 3132.0
don't have that Disney [ __ ] okay

3130.049 --> 3134.519
that's exactly what I just basically

3132.0 --> 3136.89
described but listen I'm saying they're

3134.519 --> 3138.6299999999997
materialistic I mean you know they love

3136.89 --> 3141.089
with freaking Ferrari if you know if you

3138.63 --> 3143.099
can get it and you know the shoes and

3141.089 --> 3147.21
bags and all that [ __ ] like any woman

3143.099 --> 3150.599
but they don't have that that Western

3147.21 --> 3152.93
fairy tale you don't I mean they're just

3150.599 --> 3156.9
it did a probably more materialistic

3152.93 --> 3162.18
than Western women but they just they

3156.9 --> 3163.259
don't have that fairy tale [ __ ] but

3162.18 --> 3164.819
look there's material

3163.259 --> 3167.4
there's materialism and there's

3164.819 --> 3170.19
materialism when materialism goes into

3167.4 --> 3170.94
unreasonable greed levels that's

3170.19 --> 3173.579
different

3170.94 --> 3175.7690000000002
what if you're just very pragmatic and

3173.579 --> 3178.1090000000004
focused on getting the material things

3175.769 --> 3182.1899999999996
right I think that's more the type of

3178.109 --> 3185.46
mindset that you're finding in Asia keep

3182.19 --> 3187.92
control of the money more than just one

3185.46 --> 3191.7
more I want more I want to be the star

3187.92 --> 3196.559
and be worshipped that that typical

3191.7 --> 3198.45
typically you will find in the West yeah

3196.559 --> 3206.25
I guess they're just less less

3198.45 --> 3209.16
delusional about again yeah yeah used to

3206.25 --> 3213.119
you you see you you overheard complicate

3209.16 --> 3216.18
things okay I know all right bro how's

3213.119 --> 3221.46
things it's funny cuz you by the way he

3216.18 --> 3223.68
didn't say what you said yeah I had to

3221.46 --> 3227.16
do it in advance before people were

3223.68 --> 3229.7
actually freeway yes you gotta prove

3227.16 --> 3233.64
your English skills as European

3229.7 --> 3236.5789999999997
everybody knows that I also have to

3233.64 --> 3236.91
prove that I just that I'm ahead you

3236.579 --> 3239.4300000000003
know

3236.91 --> 3243.1189999999997
optical slabs okay all the graphics

3239.43 --> 3245.1699999999996
serve I have to bring it out and start

3243.119 --> 3248.65
yelling about it before Pete

3245.17 --> 3251.319
even started to wander in that direction

3248.65 --> 3252.67
yet that's what I like to do what I'm

3251.319 --> 3254.2599999999998
sorry my English is not very good

3252.67 --> 3257.41
looking

3254.26 --> 3259.23
no your English look it's not true it's

3257.41 --> 3261.67
not true it's very exciting

3259.23 --> 3264.299
with flat earth man there's a lot of

3261.67 --> 3268.119
changes since I left

3264.299 --> 3268.72
flattery man the worst can you be more

3268.119 --> 3273.4300000000003
specific

3268.72 --> 3276.0299999999997
oh so flat I mean you've got like so

3273.43 --> 3278.47
Nate Nathan and doesn't seem like he's

3276.03 --> 3279.52
seems like he's got to move on to

3278.47 --> 3281.049
something good I don't know it doesn't

3279.52 --> 3283.45
seem like he's coming back anytime soon

3281.049 --> 3285.94
okay no no he's working on it yeah buddy

3283.45 --> 3290.799
II can't he's being stalked by a

3285.94 --> 3294.299
corporation yeah I think you need to

3290.799 --> 3298.9
duck and leave and do something just

3294.299 --> 3300.28
outside of the basket no no that's a

3298.9 --> 3302.92
problem it's gonna start up a new

3300.28 --> 3304.599
channel then that will also be targeted

3302.92 --> 3308.109
and taken down so the only thing that he

3304.599 --> 3312.069
can do is basically can I finish what he

3308.109 --> 3313.8089999999997
can do is join another show and become a

3312.069 --> 3318.21
regular part of that that's a good way

3313.809 --> 3321.4900000000002
to yeah disagree in the endoscope and

3318.21 --> 3323.68
for now he's just replaying a lot of the

3321.49 --> 3328.27
older debates they're really interesting

3323.68 --> 3332.98
to me damn it from time to time right in

3328.27 --> 3334.54
this hole Owen Benjamin which I saw that

3332.98 --> 3336.579
come in a while that I kept telling you

3334.54 --> 3339.04
guys like Owen good check out Owen

3336.579 --> 3341.559
Benjamin now it's like I don't know is

3339.04 --> 3344.88
it it was you you were the first one to

3341.559 --> 3347.799
tell me about oh yeah I do remember that

3344.88 --> 3349.6600000000003
thank you I I mean not that I need

3347.799 --> 3353.44
credit but I just don't I saw this

3349.66 --> 3357.16
coming like weeks I was trying to

3353.44 --> 3359.38
remember who told me about the guy I see

3357.16 --> 3360.1299999999997
the video mirror every word the story or

3359.38 --> 3362.71
what's going on

3360.13 --> 3364.6600000000003
I um follow it up no idea was Bowie same

3362.71 --> 3366.79
of what he's coming from like I'm not

3364.66 --> 3368.799
interested for me it was very special

3366.79 --> 3373.7799999999997
Owen Benjamin because when you guys

3368.799 --> 3376.359
started talking about it oh just a short

3373.78 --> 3376.69
story when I just heard about it from

3376.359 --> 3380.5299999999997
you

3376.69 --> 3384.01
guys I I recognize that because I had

3380.53 --> 3386.8900000000003
been basically watching him on the Alex

3384.01 --> 3388.5690000000004
Jones Show where he just is apart he's

3386.89 --> 3391.66
there sometimes it's really interesting

3388.569 --> 3392.8
and actually almost on the Alex Jones

3391.66 --> 3394.42
Show when he had did it a little

3392.8 --> 3397.119
monologue he actually started talking

3394.42 --> 3400.39
about how he believes that you can't

3397.119 --> 3402.94
land on the moon for example that's like

3400.39 --> 3406.0299999999997
again talking about Flat Earth without

3402.94 --> 3409.859
talking about Flat Earth and loved it so

3406.03 --> 3412.5690000000004
yeah I came to it from my own angle and

3409.859 --> 3416.14
yeah it's very interesting to see what's

3412.569 --> 3418.63
gonna happen with him well I like I like

3416.14 --> 3420.2799999999997
the his last kind of big statement that

3418.63 --> 3423.369
all the Flat Earth who's jumped on was

3420.28 --> 3426.7900000000004
like I can't beat a flat earth person

3423.369 --> 3428.8900000000003
which I agree because I've always said

3426.79 --> 3430.96
I'm still not a flat earth I'm just not

3428.89 --> 3433.81
I'm not one of you guys you know what I

3430.96 --> 3438.04
mean I'm not a flat earther I'm just

3433.81 --> 3440.29
Eric the [ __ ] dick so I mean I don't

3438.04 --> 3443.89
know I don't know I mean the whole thing

3440.29 --> 3445.63
is it's really deep to me I don't know

3443.89 --> 3448.18
maybe I could be wrong but to me it's

3445.63 --> 3451.359
not really calling yourself a flat

3448.18 --> 3454.72
earther but it's really just stop

3451.359 --> 3457.0
believing that you live on a ball you

3454.72 --> 3465.5499999999997
kind of just become a flat earth or

3457.0 --> 3467.589
whether you say it or not I don't even

3465.55 --> 3469.27
like calling myself an anarchist I just

3467.589 --> 3475.0299999999997
don't like people telling me what the

3469.27 --> 3476.74
[ __ ] to do and just figure this [ __ ]

3475.03 --> 3479.079
out we can just go back to being

3476.74 --> 3481.66
earthers and not having to be flat earth

3479.079 --> 3485.44
or round earth or anything we could just

3481.66 --> 3487.27
be earthlings I think you know like I

3485.44 --> 3490.359
would like to go back to that and stop

3487.27 --> 3497.829
this silly [ __ ] or how about just being

3490.359 --> 3503.02
an earth or Elmer yeah Wow with Eric is

3497.829 --> 3505.75
to to be the man the living man in the

3503.02 --> 3507.97
moment and you can be male or female

3505.75 --> 3508.93
just be the living man in the moment

3507.97 --> 3511.2999999999997
what happened to that

3508.93 --> 3517.1499999999996

3541.51 --> 3545.7900000000004

3566.07 --> 3570.2400000000002
unforgivable hang-up so sitting in my

3568.18 --> 3574.0299999999997
[ __ ] is ringing

3570.24 --> 3580.54
Mars I did that by mistake once to Rohit

3574.03 --> 3584.71
war oh he's mentally unstable that's

3580.54 --> 3593.95
what's wrong thing North Dakota and it's

3584.71 --> 3598.0
calling you in the morning I'm gonna

3593.95 --> 3599.6499999999996
present Jose's video now right Ron

3598.0 --> 3601.6
please check this out this is halfway

3599.65 --> 3604.09
because the first part of the video you

3601.6 --> 3606.87
can see the whole boat but this look at

3604.09 --> 3606.8700000000003
the look at the

3612.99 --> 3615.0499999999997
you

3715.04 --> 3718.97
yeah I'm just saying like more people is

3717.14 --> 3721.1299999999997
getting this same effect because that's

3718.97 --> 3723.77
what we see and this has been hijack as

3721.13 --> 3726.56
for curvature curvature my ass it's just

3723.77 --> 3729.02
getting getting mirroring and getting

3726.56 --> 3733.36
deformed with this Mirage thing you know

3729.02 --> 3733.36
no going no behind us

3733.65 --> 3736.8
[Music]

3741.07 --> 3743.13
you

3780.16 --> 3785.27
there's always curvature and there's

3782.69 --> 3787.67
always some type of structure we further

3785.27 --> 3788.48
in the background that's just standing

3787.67 --> 3792.11
straight up

3788.48 --> 3795.29
I need agrees straight up

3792.11 --> 3800.06
but that lovely falling behind the

3795.29 --> 3802.22
curvature like I don't understand how

3800.06 --> 3804.92
they don't understand that yeah but even

3802.22 --> 3806.5099999999998
beyond that expert at this and I can see

3804.92 --> 3809.54
that there's something wrong they're

3806.51 --> 3813.11
actually telling me right here is curved

3809.54 --> 3814.16
but further back is not but that's it

3813.11 --> 3816.44
worse than that

3814.16 --> 3818.6299999999997
it gets even worse than that because if

3816.44 --> 3822.2000000000003
you realize okay you should be looking

3818.63 --> 3825.32
at things or rather yeah things slightly

3822.2 --> 3826.8199999999997
slanted like that then yeah somebody in

3825.32 --> 3831.6200000000003
that building is gonna have to be

3826.82 --> 3834.2000000000003
looking down to you as well that heaven

3831.62 --> 3837.5899999999997

3841.52 --> 3847.37
let it flow and somebody really starts

3843.74 --> 3861.4399999999996
to get really offensive who is nice

3847.37 --> 3866.93
memetics how did to get in how did he

3861.44 --> 3870.7000000000003
get know in the side price there's

3866.93 --> 3876.62
nobody yeah but do you write their sons

3870.7 --> 3880.79

3876.62 --> 3883.93
me yeah all right right right okay okay

3880.79 --> 3886.61

him out for a little bit please blame

3889.67 --> 3897.64
think oh he's he's just being typical

3892.46 --> 3897.64
troll yeah just just tired about for top

3903.469 --> 3909.349
to get got dropped like mid-sentence

3906.13 --> 3914.109
okay yeah he's being kind of lame it's

3909.349 --> 3917.799
almost not worth punishing anyway fine

3914.109 --> 3923.509
there's no tolerance for retards anymore

3917.799 --> 3929.93
no quarter you know you have to hang out

3923.509 --> 3931.939
page on day the light right that's right

3929.93 --> 3934.999
you've been compromising people if they

3931.939 --> 3936.469
get really really nasty I win you been

3934.999 --> 3940.759
compromised you were showing the Hangout

3936.469 --> 3942.14

3954.499 --> 3962.569
you no absolutely not at the moment I

3959.63 --> 3965.539
present there's one screen I click

3962.569 --> 3967.009
before it initiates and that's a Firefox

3965.539 --> 3969.0190000000002
when there's nothing to do with hangout

3967.009 --> 3974.689
so no that's not possible

3969.019 --> 3976.839
I thought it's okay it's a good thing to

3974.689 --> 3980.719
realize but the I've been very careful

3976.839 --> 3983.949
so far this guy's not gonna be porn

3980.719 --> 3983.949
bombed thank you very much

3985.77 --> 3990.97
yeah you're getting you seem to be

3987.72 --> 3992.98
nailing down OBS there I win good Anya

yeah I'm getting the hang of it you look

3992.98 --> 3999.01
a lot better and yeah I still have to

3995.86 --> 4001.08
get my audio right because yeah now

3999.01 --> 4004.23
these days when I'm listening back I

4001.08 --> 4006.21
almost get a headache from that that is

4004.23 --> 4008.94
constantly there so I want to get rid of

4006.21 --> 4013.68
it for me for me to be able to listen

4008.94 --> 4015.9
back without having that and yes here's

4013.68 --> 4018.45
some of this so much of that white noise

4015.9 --> 4018.9900000000002
kind of yeah it sounded like your

4018.45 --> 4021.06
computer

4018.99 --> 4024.18
no but that's different that's wrong

4021.06 --> 4025.86
cause that's because I'm do guys that's

4024.18 --> 4027.96
because of the audio that you are

4025.86 --> 4031.8900000000003
receiving through the hangouts and that

4027.96 --> 4035.61
audio has no problem it is literally how

4031.89 --> 4037.68
do works on my computer that's not doing

4035.61 --> 4040.29
it properly it's not using the right

4037.68 --> 4043.35
code there right algorithm or whatever

4040.29 --> 4045.48
and I need to fix it with audio banana

4043.35 --> 4047.43
and I'm gonna try to do that the end of

4045.48 --> 4050.64
the month when I have some extra money

4047.43 --> 4054.39
to invest in doing that

4050.64 --> 4056.93
just shut out run T to YouTube chat

4069.88 --> 4078.73
hour and people may have noticed my

4073.9 --> 4084.849

4078.73 --> 4087.46
stuck at 995 now they just can't get

4084.849 --> 4090.28
there but Lorna I must have said

4087.46 --> 4092.32
something so terrible that they oh and

4090.28 --> 4097.779
subscribe they feel so bad

4092.32 --> 4099.43
not maybe I should dig in this some four

4097.779 --> 4101.68
or five accounts and it's just that

4099.43 --> 4103.450000000001
that's no no it doesn't help look

4101.68 --> 4105.069
there's even been ballers that have been

4103.45 --> 4107.1089999999995
trying to do that and it just doesn't

4105.069 --> 4109.2390000000005
work they immediately all the sucks get

4107.109 --> 4111.029
immediately unsubscribe YouTube

4109.239 --> 4115.45
mysteriously screwing around with me

4111.029 --> 4118.150000000001
grantee Flat Earth to YouTube chat or

4115.45 --> 4120.509

4136.0 --> 4143.319
premiere is it just like reruns or what

4139.589 --> 4145.63
it's a rerun with a new side champion so

4143.319 --> 4147.1900000000005
what they cook through here like it's

4145.63 --> 4149.4400000000005
exact opposite

4147.19 --> 4151.7789999999995
no it's premiering it's the first time

4149.44 --> 4155.0199999999995
something has been put out as a video

4151.779 --> 4157.06
and not as a live stream you can put

4155.02 --> 4166.4800000000005
anything in there any type of video you

4157.06 --> 4168.13
like hey I see him in chat boy so it's

4166.48 --> 4170.2
pretty it's pretty interesting weather

4168.13 --> 4171.79
whatever you think about this whole

4170.2 --> 4174.66
Owen Benjamin but it's kind of like

4171.79 --> 4180.069
we're seeing a live stream of a

4174.66 --> 4181.989
psychological breakdown like live like I

4180.069 --> 4187.660000000001
don't know what you guys think is it is

4181.989 --> 4190.839
it scripted do what it is I mean if he's

4187.66 --> 4193.67
being genuine which I don't I don't know

4190.839 --> 4198.86
I it seems to me that he is I mean

4193.67 --> 4202.82
I couldn't him reliable enough to let

4198.86 --> 4206.089999999999
him engage and move the bar slowly again

4202.82 --> 4208.13
well he's talking about a lot I mean you

4206.09 --> 4212.17
know he's getting the Jewish thing

4208.13 --> 4215.57
he's hitting pedophilia I was hitting

4212.17 --> 4219.64
government being he's hitting all I

4215.57 --> 4224.57
don't know man listening a lot of [ __ ]

4219.64 --> 4227.51
right he doesn't seem to be very afraid

4224.57 --> 4229.21
of opening his mouth about well maybe

4227.51 --> 4236.900000000001
that's the reason why they picked him

4229.21 --> 4239.18
somebody was talking about the

4236.9 --> 4242.089999999999
moon-landing him and speaking about that

4239.18 --> 4243.280000000001
in a way that he is I think that changes

4242.09 --> 4247.67
the whole game

4243.28 --> 4249.32
God how many follow was he lost once he

4247.67 --> 4253.1
started talking about it but then look

4249.32 --> 4265.19
how many people he gained after after

4253.1 --> 4266.81
that loss you know and he asked all the

4265.19 --> 4268.429999999999
questions all the right questions all

4266.81 --> 4270.740000000001
the things that I've been asking about

4268.43 --> 4273.17
them not anything that just make it seem

4270.74 --> 4277.07
freakin ridiculous he's done the

4273.17 --> 4278.84
homework yeah it's just so simple why I

4277.07 --> 4280.73
don't understand all these ballers that

4278.84 --> 4284.0
have been on YouTube all these years

4280.73 --> 4285.44
fighting Flat Earth and still defending

4284.0 --> 4288.98
the moon landings like are you guys

4285.44 --> 4292.19
serious if you guys can't see this like

4288.98 --> 4294.7699999999995
I I'm gay yeah even though I know if I

4292.19 --> 4296.99
can't even talk to you like you talked

4294.77 --> 4298.76

4425.01 --> 4428.13
can get this sorted out

4426.54 --> 4429.54
yeah but now I don't have an answer to

4428.13 --> 4431.579
this to what the hell you were talking

4429.54 --> 4434.4
about was that about Owen Benjamin

4431.579 --> 4435.989
nurses some artificial phone call these

4434.4 --> 4438.98
pre-planned what are you talking about

4452.59 --> 4464.860000000001
Nixon Nixon phone calls from from the

4470.29 --> 4476.89
not sound like some type of pre-scripted

4473.34 --> 4480.79
[ __ ] I mean there's no other way I

4476.89 --> 4482.410000000001
could put it once you get past that it

4480.79 --> 4489.31
actually happened which we all know they

4482.41 --> 4495.16
did it hard to just make a landline to

4489.31 --> 4497.650000000001
some like cabin a few way and just put

4495.16 --> 4514.36
an automated delay in between the line

4497.65 --> 4521.379999999999
it's very easy spinning over complicated

4514.36 --> 4527.7699999999995
it's already so it's just radio

4521.38 --> 4529.6
communication come on the link is posted

4527.77 --> 4535.17
in the chat room don't you posted the

4529.6 --> 4538.84
link you know listen come on guys it's

4535.17 --> 4541.15
2019 I think it's time we need to start

4538.84 --> 4551.860000000001
planning a you know like we have

4541.15 --> 4554.849999999999
Halloween I thinking about the Chinese

4551.86 --> 4554.849999999999
will man thing over there

4554.91 --> 4562.33
listen I do they don't go off you really

4559.9 --> 4566.95
that's such a brilliant idea again so

4562.33 --> 4569.92
creative so constructive for make a new

4566.95 --> 4571.66
holiday concept about the death of the

4569.92 --> 4573.01
boss very positive it's gonna have a

4571.66 --> 4582.269
great readout from

4573.01 --> 4585.1900000000005
no brilliant eirick brilliant elebrate

4582.269 --> 4588.070000000001
why don't we just celebrate the truth

4585.19 --> 4591.46
and not emphasize the death or some kind

4588.07 --> 4596.489
of horrid fate of an opposing religion

4591.46 --> 4596.4890000000005
let them just work it out over time okay

4596.849 --> 4602.829
well technically if there's there was no

4600.25 --> 4605.23
blow that it can't be really attached of

4602.829 --> 4609.34
the globe Bennet really exists it's just

4605.23 --> 4612.339999999999
a story right true okay so back to the

4609.34 --> 4614.2300000000005
Chinese moon landing dude they there

4612.34 --> 4616.42
seriously I've been I've been looking

4614.23 --> 4618.489
for newspapers and I asked Chinese

4616.42 --> 4620.969
people like they have no idea what I'm

4618.489 --> 4620.968999999999
talking about

4622.92 --> 4628.869
Jericho just did the first the first

4626.01 --> 4632.369000000001
moon landing on the far side of the Moon

4628.869 --> 4636.098999999999
and nobody knows anything

4632.369 --> 4637.719
nobody's tiny I haven't found anybody

4636.099 --> 4640.9890000000005
that knows what I'm talking about

4637.719 --> 4643.05
I'm like so China did no we don't know

4640.989 --> 4646.959999999999
what what are you talking about

4643.05 --> 4653.1990000000005
what now you being you having experience

4646.96 --> 4655.42
out there really if it was something

4653.199 --> 4658.058999999999
that they were able to accomplish what

4655.42 --> 4664.78
do you think that they would really

4658.059 --> 4667.869000000001
parade that around right China is trying

4664.78 --> 4671.4
to build a lot of national pride that's

4667.869 --> 4673.48
definitely a hundred percent true but

4671.4 --> 4675.879999999999
something that they would be all over

4673.48 --> 4677.049999999999
the place saying look look we've landed

4675.88 --> 4682.179
on the forest Father

4677.05 --> 4687.099
yeah well the USA we're great no I mean

4682.179 --> 4688.539
nobody just no and people can see that

4687.099 --> 4690.219
there's something wrong with that I

4688.539 --> 4693.94
don't know what to tell you and do I

4690.219 --> 4697.0
have to have to really like I know

4693.94 --> 4700.57
people like freaking Reds [ __ ] and P

4697.0 --> 4704.239
Mart like dude um I think that whole

4700.57 --> 4707.09
Chinese thing is for the Western market

4704.239 --> 4710.839999999999
I don't know what to say I don't know

4707.09 --> 4713.2390000000005
what can I conclude so they don't teach

4710.84 --> 4716.2390000000005
the ball and that kind of signs in

4713.239 --> 4718.7
Chinese schools that's all dude not so

4716.239 --> 4724.489
much in China the education system is

4718.7 --> 4726.98
basically obviously lots of math English

4724.489 --> 4728.989
English is very much stress in Chinese I

4726.98 --> 4734.12
mean sure the Chinese language I mean

4728.989 --> 4737.75
you need everyone here it's got to get

4734.12 --> 4741.05
to the earth sciences I just want to

4737.75 --> 4743.3
know the cultural implications like is

4741.05 --> 4746.81
it generally believed if there's such

4743.3 --> 4749.18
math lovers that math is reality because

4746.81 --> 4751.52
that is a foundational misconception

4749.18 --> 4756.110000000001
that leads to the Astronomy being a

4751.52 --> 4758.660000000001
possibility to them listen listen don't

4756.11 --> 4763.0
pull up but the Chinese are the Jews of

4758.66 --> 4763.0
Asia okay they're very good at money

4766.03 --> 4770.44
