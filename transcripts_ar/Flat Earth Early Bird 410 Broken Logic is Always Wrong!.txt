good to see you all alright so yeah

175.89 --> 180.29999999999998
there are some trolls about you can see

178.23 --> 183.72
it by the down votes that's that were

180.3 --> 189.08
there before I even started the show so

183.72 --> 189.08
if everybody would be vigilant for

189.2 --> 194.57999999999998
specific type of obvious trolling and

192.239 --> 199.29
just ban it outright that would be much

194.58 --> 201.59
appreciated because this is not the last

199.29 --> 201.59
one

206.74 --> 222.08
so yeah yesterday I stayed up pretty

209.75 --> 227.24
late also saw ranty life which was

222.08 --> 229.88000000000002
interesting I still don't know if if he

227.24 --> 232.18
realizes that pre probably does that my

229.88 --> 235.04
main account is banned over at his place

232.18 --> 237.47
don't know why doesn't address it I've

235.04 --> 239.23999999999998
been talking I've been saying it through

237.47 --> 241.85
my or Winnie and her account like hey

239.24 --> 243.32000000000002
I'm blocked can you unlock me but he's

241.85 --> 248.53
not addressing it

243.32 --> 248.53
so whatever man whatever

265.37 --> 270.58
it's scaring me here where

277.38 --> 280.88
Oh Sandra woods

322.82 --> 331.949
what's new Arwen well I don't know it's

328.199 --> 338.27000000000004
just some things out yeah everything's

331.949 --> 340.83000000000004
just keeping on going and I don't know I

338.27 --> 345.87
may need some time to get into things

340.83 --> 349.69899999999996
again today because yeah oh that's some

345.87 --> 349.699
been a delightful distraction

365.16 --> 371.47
hello Jose I don't remember if I was

369.13 --> 374.38
actually on Jose's panel yesterday or

371.47 --> 377.47
not I didn't watch at the background at

374.38 --> 379.33
least I don't remember I've been all

377.47 --> 382.83000000000004
over the place yesterday been doing like

379.33 --> 382.83
multiple things at the same time

387.75 --> 390.889
[Music]

394.919 --> 407.25899999999996
what yeah yeah Jose Neil Neil deGrasse

404.979 --> 409.449
Tyson adds I'm getting them all the time

407.259 --> 415.029
on my own videos on other people's

409.449 --> 417.969
videos but I think it's also just an

415.029 --> 420.159
advertising program for that that

417.969 --> 422.439
specific website of which Neil deGrasse

420.159 --> 424.659
Tyson happens to be a part but it's

422.439 --> 427.719
other stuff as well and they've been

424.659 --> 431.069
advertising like a bull online courses

427.719 --> 431.069
kind of like that

440.37 --> 443.49
[Music]

453.11 --> 459.33000000000004
anyway yesterday seems to be seems to be

456.84 --> 464.19
a day where everybody talked about 9/11

459.33 --> 469.14
for some reason and then I heard that

464.19 --> 474.84
apparently the Edition grantees from him

469.14 --> 477.81
and an Anthony that apparently a couple

474.84 --> 482.28
of globus did this hangout where they

477.81 --> 485.16
just completely sucked up to the the

482.28 --> 488.46
main line story of 9/11 and all that

485.16 --> 493.77000000000004
like the worst [ __ ] it's like totally

488.46 --> 497.94
embarrassing and yeah that kind of does

493.77 --> 500.07
make them mainstream shields but it

497.94 --> 502.56
still remains to be seen however if they

500.07 --> 506.15
are literally ordered and paid to do

502.56 --> 508.02
that or if they are just so such

506.15 --> 510.9
incredible suck-ups

508.02 --> 515.64
that they'll just do it just to get some

510.9 --> 519.39
apparent credit to get a potentially a

515.64 --> 521.25
pat on the back from the government so

519.39 --> 526.02
I'm not sure about that but it is very

521.25 --> 528.66
yeah I haven't actually watched that

526.02 --> 530.8199999999999
video good and probably I probably

528.66 --> 535.23
couldn't sit longer through it than two

530.82 --> 541.59
minutes but that is incredibly

535.23 --> 543.45
embarrassing you know Flat Earth is one

541.59 --> 550.08
thing but if you're gonna go all the way

543.45 --> 553.4300000000001
over there that's just yeah that you

550.08 --> 553.4300000000001
really don't want to learn

559.97 --> 567.83
[Music]

569.35 --> 572.07
yep

586.11 --> 591.1800000000001
okay coming Kyla Gilmore could be who

589.149 --> 591.18
knows

598.51 --> 601.88
[Music]

607.15 --> 611.37
a bomber clad Gator fish

640.08 --> 646.73
hello Dell West Watson Leah don't worry

643.709 --> 650.01
about me Fyodor Dostoevsky

646.73 --> 652.35
I've been bashed by this kind of thing

650.01 --> 654.6
for a long time it always goes up and

652.35 --> 656.61
down it's like when certain people get

654.6 --> 658.019
in certain moods they do this [ __ ] to me

656.61 --> 662.4300000000001
and then they do it for quite a while

658.019 --> 665.12
until either they lose interest or I get

662.43 --> 668.9399999999999
really pissed off in some way and then

665.12 --> 671.37
yeah I'm just I don't care anymore

668.94 --> 673.35
really not too much I just wanted to

671.37 --> 675.69
point it out to the general public like

673.35 --> 684.3290000000001
hey that's actually going on did you

675.69 --> 692.519
take notice of that what what is it Sara

684.329 --> 695.37
tokars Santina oh right yes I Rita yeah

692.519 --> 698.54
I definitely I saw that Karen B and

695.37 --> 701.82
Brian Staveley over the Mike Adams yeah

698.54 --> 704.25
I'd been watching Mike Adams through

701.82 --> 707.9100000000001
Alex Jones for some time and he's been

704.25 --> 711.42
doing this kind of thing for for a long

707.91 --> 716.67
time now he got like their room on

711.42 --> 719.43
Sunday and every Sunday he does

716.67 --> 721.89
something and sometimes he has like his

719.43 --> 724.29
globe power where he starts to insert

721.89 --> 727.38
globe or machination nonsense and his

724.29 --> 729.4499999999999
fantasy interpretations of the

727.38 --> 734.9399999999999
presuppositional end result as it were

729.45 --> 738.12
that's what he does and it's it is

734.94 --> 740.22
annoying and it is very deceptive and it

738.12 --> 742.92
is needlessly stupid and at the same

740.22 --> 745.2900000000001
time I do think that his Freesat

742.92 --> 749.579
positional based and result ideas are

745.29 --> 754.079
kind of interesting and clever in a in a

749.579 --> 757.13
creative way but yeah he it's it's just

754.079 --> 757.13
he's a global

761.08 --> 768.6800000000001
and I don't like it because I kind of I

764.21 --> 773.84
like the guy but I don't like this about

768.68 --> 778.91
him you know when Alex Jones is is old

773.84 --> 784.7
globe ER yeah he also gets all goofy and

778.91 --> 788.2099999999999
inspired and yeah it just seems like he

784.7 --> 790.4300000000001
really is he really does believe it and

788.21 --> 792.74
it's just a bit dumb and stubborn of him

790.43 --> 796.04
but with Mike Adams it's different

792.74 --> 799.49
because he he is obviously more

796.04 --> 802.31
intelligent and he should know better so

799.49 --> 805.1
then I really do get the feeling like

802.31 --> 808.76
he's like being deceptive on purpose and

805.1 --> 811.13
that's just disappointing because well I

808.76 --> 812.78
have learned a lot of good things from

811.13 --> 816.02
Mike Adams over the years over the

812.78 --> 818.39
decades and not everything is good some

816.02 --> 821.93
of it is kind of like it's also been

818.39 --> 827.0
amplified a bit by fear porn but it was

821.93 --> 828.56
still very worthwhile learning about you

827.0 --> 831.53
know and eventually like all the

828.56 --> 833.63
illusions in between all that kind of

831.53 --> 837.3199999999999
drop away and you're still left with the

833.63 --> 841.34
the good info that's how that feels to

837.32 --> 845.3000000000001
me but yeah what he's doing now I it is

841.34 --> 849.23
kind of disappointing but it could get

845.3 --> 851.2099999999999
interesting also you know maybe he it

849.23 --> 853.46
all depends on his real motivation

851.21 --> 856.94
behind it maybe in in a way like he

853.46 --> 859.07
really wants real challenges I don't

856.94 --> 862.0100000000001
know I don't know how controlled he's

859.07 --> 865.5400000000001
going to keep his interactions with

862.01 --> 865.54
flat-earthers for example

867.0 --> 878.399
I haven't seen him for example go up to

870.269 --> 879.93
David Weiss or whatever that would be a

878.399 --> 882.209
challenge that would be a genuine

879.93 --> 884.43
challenge but yeah the level of

882.209 --> 887.2199999999999
machinations he upholds in his

884.43 --> 890.189
presuppositional views he won't last

887.22 --> 892.4390000000001
very long that way and he knows that so

890.189 --> 896.16
yeah I really wonder like what is he

892.439 --> 907.29
really doing with this we'll figure it

896.16 --> 909.329
out it's a Sheol city and sure no

907.29 --> 912.17
flattered spaceman in a way because of

909.329 --> 914.939
its traction because of its

912.17 --> 918.209
attention-grabbing 'us Infowars is like

914.939 --> 920.129
in a way a big advertisement platform

918.209 --> 922.1389999999999
it's very effective for that for it

920.129 --> 926.279
because of its wide coverage because of

922.139 --> 928.41
the background so in a way yet it was

926.279 --> 931.459
probably always going to turn out to

928.41 --> 936.769
become some kind of shell city

931.459 --> 936.7689999999999
because money because opportunity

942.34 --> 945.489
[Music]

962.95 --> 966.149
[Music]

974.89 --> 985.08
oh oh right yeah I'm right

979.51 --> 987.88
mmm yeah seven no the thing is about

985.08 --> 991.9300000000001
flat earthers actually bringing up our

987.88 --> 994.18
and the presuppositions right that's

991.93 --> 996.9399999999999
actually the winning argument I know you

994.18 --> 999.4
think that's all [ __ ] because you

996.94 --> 1001.58
completely desensitized yourself and all

999.4 --> 1004.1999999999999
of you have as part of this whole

1001.58 --> 1008.1500000000001
religious global process you completely

1004.2 --> 1013.2
desensitized yourself as to the true

1008.15 --> 1015.12
logic of reasoning itself so you think

1013.2 --> 1018.21
that all these things we say are just

1015.12 --> 1021.26
nonsense or they are are machinations or

1018.21 --> 1026.07
something well no they are the actual

1021.26 --> 1029.04
mechanisms of reasoning and you just

1026.07 --> 1032.03
don't care because it doesn't work with

1029.04 --> 1032.03
your religious beliefs

1041.54 --> 1044.67
[Music]

1060.91 --> 1063.969
[Music]

1065.49 --> 1071.74
that's ridiculous

1067.45 --> 1081.309
Kublai Khan yeah a fallacy definitely

1071.74 --> 1083.26
means it's incorrect I don't know said

1081.309 --> 1086.4089999999999
that nonsense first I think it was

1083.26 --> 1089.89
somebody where was it I don't remember

1086.409 --> 1092.14
was it Friday or something but yeah a

1089.89 --> 1098.5590000000002
fallacy does actually mean it's

1092.14 --> 1101.679
incorrect also a presupposition is final

1098.559 --> 1104.3799999999999
when you're just speculating right but

1101.679 --> 1107.279
when you're actually trying to prove

1104.38 --> 1110.71
something and you're using

1107.279 --> 1114.34
presuppositions in those proofs without

1110.71 --> 1117.19
actually proving them well yeah then

1114.34 --> 1126.22
it's also incorrect I'm sorry you're

1117.19 --> 1131.409
just wrong yeah well if the logic being

1126.22 --> 1134.38
used persists in being faulty if the

1131.409 --> 1137.3200000000002
logic applied in the argument persists

1134.38 --> 1141.75
in the same manner in being faulty then

1137.32 --> 1141.75
it is incorrect Kublai Khan

1151.26 --> 1156.49
[Music]

1153.33 --> 1159.3899999999999
it's like you guys really don't want to

1156.49 --> 1159.39
understand this

1169.49 --> 1180.44
that is that is ridiculous look a faulty

1176.99 --> 1183.07
logic doesn't matter what the end result

1180.44 --> 1185.54
is and whether that is correct or not

1183.07 --> 1188.8999999999999
because it doesn't mean anything it's

1185.54 --> 1191.96
faulty so you can derive any specific

1188.9 --> 1196.6100000000001
meaning from faulty logic because it's

1191.96 --> 1198.29
faulty yet the answer does the answer

1196.61 --> 1200.6899999999998
doesn't matter anymore because it's

1198.29 --> 1203.6299999999999
going to be an answer to the faulty

1200.69 --> 1206.66
logic setup and it doesn't matter what

1203.63 --> 1210.0400000000002
the end result is gonna be this doesn't

1206.66 --> 1210.0400000000002
make any sense guys I

1227.6 --> 1230.7199999999998
[Music]

1242.24 --> 1248.78
yeah kamikaze Gilmore it seems so this

1245.43 --> 1248.78
is like shocking to me

1264.49 --> 1273.58
no no big jungus no no that's incorrect

1269.34 --> 1276.4599999999998
no if you're gonna divide two apples by

1273.58 --> 1279.4299999999998
four you're not gonna end up with two

1276.46 --> 1281.95
apples you're gonna end up with four

1279.43 --> 1283.8400000000001
half apples yeah you can stick them

1281.95 --> 1290.47
together and pretend that they're apples

1283.84 --> 1292.48
but they're half apples so no there

1290.47 --> 1296.88
seems to be a cognitive dissonance

1292.48 --> 1296.88
problem concerning math here

[Applause]

1308.63 --> 1311.919
[Music]

1319.8 --> 1326.75
what are you addressing yourself this is

1324.24 --> 1326.75
getting weird

1334.32 --> 1342.11
George is a good mathematician while

1336.99 --> 1346.02
Betty is that doesn't help him as to the

1342.11 --> 1348.03
inside of what is actually reality could

1346.02 --> 1357.93
actually be a detriment it does seem to

1348.03 --> 1358.74
be a detriment with a lot of people yeah

1357.93 --> 1361.76
that's right

1358.74 --> 1361.76
flatter spaceman

1399.99 --> 1408.78
that's ridiculous

1403.14 --> 1411.49
yeah but that's also a and what is it an

1408.78 --> 1414.4289999999999
affirming the consequent forma logical

1411.49 --> 1417.73
fallacy because the original claim is

1414.429 --> 1422.26
wrong not all men are Dutch a but if

1417.73 --> 1425.17
they would be then so would I because

1422.26 --> 1428.89
I'm Dutch yeah but they're not so

1425.17 --> 1431.679
doesn't make any sense this is this is a

1428.89 --> 1435.21
perfect example of broken logic right

1431.679 --> 1438.76
there the entire premise is irrelevant

1435.21 --> 1441.0
because the presupposition is blatantly

1438.76 --> 1441.0
incorrect

1441.36 --> 1444.5
[Music]

1445.74 --> 1451.98
yeah yeah but you seem to be desperate

1449.49 --> 1454.5
to emphasize that any kind of [ __ ]

1451.98 --> 1457.44
could result into something that in

1454.5 --> 1458.76
reality is potentially true but you're

1457.44 --> 1461.789
missing the whole point

1458.76 --> 1464.85
of logic itself if the answer is correct

1461.789 --> 1466.74
but the question is wrong then it just

1464.85 --> 1470.4599999999998
doesn't make any sense it doesn't mean

1466.74 --> 1477.0
anything what's the point

1470.46 --> 1479.3400000000001
hello hello ho can you wake up from your

1477.0 --> 1482.19
dream can you get out of your head for a

1479.34 --> 1491.1299999999999
second and actually think about what

1482.19 --> 1494.0
you're saying here if the question

1491.13 --> 1497.159
doesn't make any sense or is wrong and

1494.0 --> 1498.149
the answer may correlate in some way

1497.159 --> 1500.46
with reality

1498.149 --> 1508.7399999999998
it doesn't mean anything because the

1500.46 --> 1514.22
question is broken this weird fantasy

1508.74 --> 1516.8700000000001
about oh well maybe it is illogical or

1514.22 --> 1520.23
fallacious or blah blah whatever the

1516.87 --> 1522.1789999999999
answer is right right well that answer

1520.23 --> 1524.22
doesn't correlate to the question it

1522.179 --> 1528.679
doesn't have anything to do with the

1524.22 --> 1529.8600000000001
entire statement so all of this is just

1528.679 --> 1536.669
nonsense

1529.86 --> 1540.029
it's it's senseless yeah but the

1536.669 --> 1543.48
reasoning already admit it doesn't make

1540.029 --> 1545.789
any sense why would you do it why if you

1543.48 --> 1546.659
already got the answer then just settle

1545.789 --> 1550.59
for the answer

1546.659 --> 1552.5390000000002
don't bring broken reasoning into it you

1550.59 --> 1556.309
don't need to you're just polluting

1552.539 --> 1556.309
yourself with nonsense if you do that

1600.65 --> 1609.23
no now Kublai Khan now not really

1605.23 --> 1612.26
logical fallacies are very important in

1609.23 --> 1615.2
logic not just formal debates it is if

1612.26 --> 1617.42
you're gonna make a claim that is just

1615.2 --> 1619.19
more than just saying something silly

1617.42 --> 1622.5800000000002
that doesn't mean anything no if you're

1619.19 --> 1624.68
gonna make an actual claim if in then it

1622.58 --> 1627.11
matters the structure of the statement

1624.68 --> 1630.8
matters if you're gonna presuppose

1627.11 --> 1632.54
things without proof or there is a

1630.8 --> 1635.84
formal logical fallacy of some other

1632.54 --> 1640.0
type going on so that it's broken it

1635.84 --> 1647.57
doesn't matter what the answer will be

1640.0 --> 1649.25
because the statement is broken I don't

1647.57 --> 1651.47
know why you keep on trying to persist

1649.25 --> 1655.99
this is like really desperate [ __ ]

1651.47 --> 1655.99
you're you're digging in the dirt here

1694.65 --> 1699.8500000000001
yeah well good luck

1697.38 --> 1702.3700000000001
maybe you should seek some help for that

1699.85 --> 1706.6
Kublai Khan maybe you should talk to

1702.37 --> 1708.7299999999998
like a psychology about that I'm sure

1706.6 --> 1711.09
they'll be very glad to help you with

1708.73 --> 1711.09
that

1729.26 --> 1733.75
and I know a right mark color

1781.1 --> 1787.35
hmm no Martin Allen I don't have toast

1784.95 --> 1796.8300000000002
this is what's left of my Illuminati

1787.35 --> 1798.539
calzone oh man I really needed that I

1796.83 --> 1812.25
should have probably eaten that before

1798.539 --> 1817.679
the show couldn't find the time yeah

1812.25 --> 1821.029
yeah well please keep your sodomy talk

1817.679 --> 1821.029
to yourself Ren Thorson

1822.77 --> 1825.819
[Music]

1864.21 --> 1869.33
it's so gross about this what are you

1866.789 --> 1869.33
whining about

1884.01 --> 1893.43
hmm nah I'm just taking my time waiting

1889.33 --> 1893.4299999999998
for some kind of response

1903.29 --> 1911.18
I just find it fascinating that Kubel

1908.72 --> 1916.64
icon thinks he actually won some kind of

1911.18 --> 1920.0600000000002
point by broking yeah by explaining that

1916.64 --> 1923.0
broken logic can lead to a correct

1920.06 --> 1925.6399999999999
answer that happens to correlate with

1923.0 --> 1934.87
reality and that that is a win somehow

1925.64 --> 1938.17
I've just baffled ha Thank You Derrick

1934.87 --> 1941.2099999999998
yeah and and dank actually supports me

1938.17 --> 1944.24
okay he actually supports me on this

1941.21 --> 1948.19

1944.24 --> 1948.19
thank you Dad for all your support

1971.499 --> 1984.8600000000001
how my god Kublai Khan

1979.659 --> 1988.419
how are you showing that what I'm saying

1984.86 --> 1990.4889999999998
is incorrect no what I'm saying is

1988.419 --> 1993.44
spot-on

1990.489 --> 1995.749
it is multiple angle it is the bigger

1993.44 --> 2005.169
picture you're you're just making a

1995.749 --> 2008.2
broken point here literally you're

2005.169 --> 2012.1290000000001
trying to build some kind of reasoning

2008.2 --> 2017.44
statement out of literal admitted broken

2012.129 --> 2021.039
logic hello hello this is starting to

2017.44 --> 2023.23
sound a little psychotic maybe should

2021.039 --> 2026.85
step back for a second and think about

2023.23 --> 2026.85
what you're trying to do here

2032.28 --> 2041.3999999999999
Oh Oh

2038.22 --> 2044.31
Kublai Khan oh yeah well thank you for

2041.4 --> 2048.09
that thank you for trying to help me

2044.31 --> 2051.23
stop sounding stupid thank you that

2048.09 --> 2051.23
sounds really genuine

2065.45 --> 2075.9089999999997
no code like on you this is just this is

2070.49 --> 2078.589
Brenda level retardation here literally

2075.909 --> 2080.9500000000003
you're trying to tell me like yeah it

2078.589 --> 2085.79
doesn't really matter what you do

2080.95 --> 2087.589
because doesn't matter whatever you're

2085.79 --> 2090.319
trying to presuppose whatever you're

2087.589 --> 2092.54
trying to say as long as the end result

2090.319 --> 2094.79
of that thing you're trying to do in

2092.54 --> 2098.93
some way is going to correlate with

2094.79 --> 2099.47
reality then it's alright then it's

2098.93 --> 2101.3289999999997
correct

2099.47 --> 2104.3289999999997
even though the logic behind it the

2101.329 --> 2109.9900000000002
structural logic is broken admittedly so

2104.329 --> 2115.01
you're a lunatic buddy you're a lunatic

2109.99 --> 2117.4399999999996
why don't you go divine answers correct

2115.01 --> 2119.78
answers in some other weird shitty way

2117.44 --> 2123.559
you know when you go throw some bones or

2119.78 --> 2126.2000000000003
read some Tilly's and and actually feel

2123.559 --> 2128.5690000000004
the shame saying that because people

2126.2 --> 2130.3999999999996
that are a tune the energies can

2128.569 --> 2134.29
actually derive real things from that

2130.4 --> 2141.859
but you seem to be deriving things from

2134.29 --> 2144.339
mathematical nonsense seriously get some

2141.859 --> 2144.339
help

2145.54 --> 2151.55
yeah Jordan opt-out I listen to it for a

2149.06 --> 2153.56
short while but then I had to stop

2151.55 --> 2158.3
listening because it just was really

2153.56 --> 2161.57
annoying it's there's nothing serious

2158.3 --> 2163.75
that I could take from that podcast it's

2161.57 --> 2167.1800000000003
all just a bunch of goofing around and

2163.75 --> 2170.36
laughing and not sharing a lot of good

2167.18 --> 2172.5499999999997
information and inserting all kinds of

2170.36 --> 2178.31
conspiracy nonsense on top of everything

2172.55 --> 2180.8500000000004
just being as noisy as possible no but

2178.31 --> 2180.85
thanks for trying

2190.5 --> 2199.16
it no music man two sticks in the ground

2194.49 --> 2202.8799999999997
does not show curved surfaces it doesn't

2199.16 --> 2202.8799999999997
that's ridiculous

2210.14 --> 2213.23
[Music]

2215.3 --> 2221.17
I can already feel that today is gonna

2217.76 --> 2223.73
be a crazy day on the flat earth debates

2221.17 --> 2227.4500000000003
people have certainly opened up a few

2223.73 --> 2230.45
cans of psychosis it seems here willing

2227.45 --> 2242.93
to go deeper deeper into the broken

2230.45 --> 2245.6899999999996
logic yeah weld your knob though look

2242.93 --> 2248.1189999999997
maybe you're really attuned to that show

2245.69 --> 2249.589
and you like it and you feel like you

2248.119 --> 2251.7200000000003
could be one of the guys and all that

2249.589 --> 2253.67
yeah I bet you can listen to the whole

2251.72 --> 2257.18
show and enjoy it and even get some good

2253.67 --> 2260.06
data from it in a way I watch Alex Jones

2257.18 --> 2263.089
that way and I don't want some watching

2260.06 --> 2266.7799999999997
constantly though but yeah other people

2263.089 --> 2268.64
that have that same responses like oh my

2266.78 --> 2271.19
god you can actually listen to Alex

2268.64 --> 2276.109
Jones for longer than 30 seconds I can't

2271.19 --> 2278.9
well it's because I kind of gotten used

2276.109 --> 2282.83
to it and adapted a bit and I can take a

2278.9 --> 2284.869
lot of his nonsense so but I understand

2282.83 --> 2286.9
if you like that show it's just not my

2284.869 --> 2286.9
thing

2302.33 --> 2310.65
lights which lights would those be music

2306.66 --> 2314.91
man are you talking about a a man-made

2310.65 --> 2316.62
lamp that can be triangulated to a

2314.91 --> 2318.21
specific position on the earth and

2316.62 --> 2320.97
confirm that it is there and that's

2318.21 --> 2327.81
shining everywhere did you use your

2320.97 --> 2332.1899999999996
sticks on that or are you using the

2327.81 --> 2334.2599999999998
light from the Sun yeah I knew you would

2332.19 --> 2337.11
yeah well there's this funny thing about

2334.26 --> 2340.53
the daylight the sunlight right that is

2337.11 --> 2344.58
as a very specific angular relation to

2340.53 --> 2347.34
the position of the earth but yeah it

2344.58 --> 2349.47
only works if you really think that some

2347.34 --> 2354.4700000000003
kind of proof of curve it only works if

2349.47 --> 2357.29
you presuppose the earth is a ball and

2354.47 --> 2359.0699999999997
the Sun is going around it or

2357.29 --> 2361.11
heliocentric wise the other way around

2359.07 --> 2363.27
the earth is supposedly going around the

2361.11 --> 2366.15
Sun that's the only way that piece of

2363.27 --> 2368.55
reasoning work at least a lot to prove

2366.15 --> 2371.4300000000003
it's called presupposing the earth is a

2368.55 --> 2374.52
globe so yeah if you presuppose the

2371.43 --> 2376.5
earth is a globe and that the Sun is a

2374.52 --> 2379.11
big giant ball out there and the earth

2376.5 --> 2382.35
is going around it and it's turning kind

2379.11 --> 2384.1200000000003
of in the face of it well then sticks in

2382.35 --> 2387.0
the ground could if you actually

2384.12 --> 2389.48
physically prove all of that first then

2387.0 --> 2392.22
sticks in the ground could be like a

2389.48 --> 2394.65
secondary backup proof that the earth

2392.22 --> 2397.5
may be curved yeah that's really great

2394.65 --> 2400.77
you got to prove the primary foundations

2397.5 --> 2403.98
first though because you don't do that

2400.77 --> 2407.64
by putting sticks in the ground and then

2403.98 --> 2410.01
seeing the Sun shadow that doesn't

2407.64 --> 2412.7999999999997
actually prove the curve you have to

2410.01 --> 2415.0200000000004
presuppose a lot in order to make that

2412.8 --> 2418.86
into a proof and it's going to be a

2415.02 --> 2422.72
secondary proof only so good luck with

2418.86 --> 2422.7200000000003
that No

2424.69 --> 2435.91
I don't care what he is or what he was

2432.63 --> 2438.52
nobody's gonna shove presuppositional

2435.91 --> 2440.2889999999998
nonsense in my face and think and claim

2438.52 --> 2443.73
that that is actually proof and get away

2440.289 --> 2443.73
with it thank you

2453.32 --> 2460.01
yeah Honaker yeah if you presuppose

2456.74 --> 2463.7299999999996
everything that you want to prove yeah

2460.01 --> 2469.5200000000004
you could do that yeah doesn't prove

2463.73 --> 2472.37
anything though you don't even know what

2469.52 --> 2474.82
a presupposition is apparently music man

2472.37 --> 2478.13
even though I literally explained it

2474.82 --> 2483.8
pretty detailed not in full detail but

2478.13 --> 2486.94
enough so you don't know what a

2483.8 --> 2486.94
presupposition is

2492.51 --> 2498.3
I just told everything about it music

2495.78 --> 2503.5800000000004
man I just told you how it is a

2498.3 --> 2506.1000000000004
presupposition in order for shadows from

2503.58 --> 2509.0099999999998
sticks in the ground to supposedly

2506.1 --> 2513.27
proved curved you first have to

2509.01 --> 2518.13
presuppose that you are on a ball going

2513.27 --> 2520.59
around a Sun right and then as a

2518.13 --> 2523.02
secondary side effect you can draw the

2520.59 --> 2526.17
conclusions from all of that already

2523.02 --> 2529.2599999999998
having to be there that the earth is

2526.17 --> 2531.9900000000002
curved based on the shadows but you have

2529.26 --> 2534.21
to prove all these things first you

2531.99 --> 2536.0099999999998
first have to prove our you have to

2534.21 --> 2538.7400000000002
prove that the earth is actually a ball

2536.01 --> 2542.4900000000002
and has a radius and that it does

2538.74 --> 2545.7
actually move and spin and go around

2542.49 --> 2547.7099999999996
this Sun which would have to be proven

2545.7 --> 2550.35
in a giant ball of fire at a huge

2547.71 --> 2552.48
distance in the first place and none of

2550.35 --> 2555.96
it is proven it's all presupposed all of

2552.48 --> 2558.21
it because otherwise yeah there would be

2555.96 --> 2560.52
answers to housekeeping questions that

2558.21 --> 2563.34
make logical sense and have empirical

2560.52 --> 2566.82
back data and there isn't there hasn't

2563.34 --> 2568.92
been for years now I know you don't like

2566.82 --> 2572.79
it and now you're all gonna go Nathan

2568.92 --> 2577.7400000000002
Oakley chat style now just pump out some

2572.79 --> 2580.7
extra pushy [ __ ] reaffirm your religious

2621.93 --> 2624.93
mmm

2625.47 --> 2632.0099999999998
they're lovely isn't it people just love

2629.069 --> 2633.75
to keep on digging it's like digging in

2632.01 --> 2635.73
the Legos if you can find a special

2633.75 --> 2638.31
piece so just keep on thinking like Oh

2635.73 --> 2639.93
what what is that actually or what is it

2638.31 --> 2642.119
in our model what is it is it really

2639.93 --> 2645.1189999999997
what they said to us what the priest

2642.119 --> 2647.369
told us it is or really the mistake it's

2645.119 --> 2650.609
just playing with a bunch of fictional

2647.369 --> 2653.28
Legos you guys can't help it but yeah

2650.609 --> 2656.16
you're doing that as a side effect from

2653.28 --> 2658.3190000000004
me pointing out that you have no proofs

2656.16 --> 2660.0299999999997
and that you have no answers on the

2658.319 --> 2661.859
housekeeping questions and that if

2660.03 --> 2665.19
you're gonna presuppose things you have

2661.859 --> 2667.619
to prove those things first that's how

2665.19 --> 2675.66
it works that's how logic works that's

2667.619 --> 2679.02
how proof works so but yeah keep on

2675.66 --> 2681.81
sidetracking I know you love to do that

2679.02 --> 2684.77
there's so much to fantasize about in

2681.81 --> 2684.77
your model I know

2685.3 --> 2688.3590000000004
[Music]

2693.849 --> 2702.279
now big chunga's I've I've actually been

2696.549 --> 2705.609
able to test some of that concerning

2702.279 --> 2714.699
oxygen and other gases and in in

2705.609 --> 2718.8089999999997
chemistry I've kept my breath for a long

2714.699 --> 2722.109
time and I've even had availability of

2718.809 --> 2725.8590000000004
oxygen gas and that's also thanks to my

2722.109 --> 2729.449
goldsmithing so yeah I definitely am

2725.859 --> 2729.449
aware of oxygen Thanks

2755.82 --> 2761.54
Wow

2758.0 --> 2765.79
this is ridiculous you're really

2761.54 --> 2765.79
expecting me to respond to all that

2779.14 --> 2785.989
[Music]

2780.589 --> 2789.619
- why are you side tracking me in this

2785.989 --> 2791.359
nonsense why do I need to explain to you

2789.619 --> 2792.349
how I've determined that I need oxygen

2791.359 --> 2797.9
to survive

2792.349 --> 2801.829
really and by the way yeah because

2797.9 --> 2803.6890000000003
you're doing that it's two things you

2801.829 --> 2806.2090000000003
need oxygen and you need to get rid of

2803.689 --> 2808.759
the co2 that you produce in your body

2806.209 --> 2812.68
that's it that that's the combination of

2808.759 --> 2812.68
processes it's two-way stream

2831.27 --> 2840.75
no no Kublai Khan that is absolute horse

2836.369 --> 2843.1800000000003
[ __ ] you know it the housekeeping

2840.75 --> 2845.46

2843.18 --> 2849.45
[ __ ] all over the place it's the same

2845.46 --> 2853.77
[ __ ] rumpus and all the george is in

2853.77 --> 2859.5
piece of [ __ ] demon goblin out there

2856.44 --> 2862.08
yeah it's all that it doesn't answer the

2859.5 --> 2876.2
question it's all more machinations it's

2862.08 --> 2876.2
[ __ ] it's the same [ __ ]

morons no but they do this [ __ ] all the

2899.59 --> 2904.4500000000003
time if there's something new they're

2902.05 --> 2911.1400000000003
always the first to try shove it in our

2904.45 --> 2914.5
faces and try to score some points and

2911.14 --> 2919.0
it's always the same [ __ ] machinations

2914.5 --> 2921.43
lies miss assumptions fabrications

2919.0 --> 2923.98
of words used in a deceptive way to

2921.43 --> 2927.64
deviate from original meanings and cover

2923.98 --> 2930.28
up insights yeah machinations that's

2927.64 --> 2933.69
what they are just like the frickin

2930.28 --> 2933.69
curvature calculator Oh

2935.29 --> 2939.93
oh ho music mat now that's time for you

2937.96 --> 2943.7200000000003

2939.93 --> 2946.48
you're not getting any older oh I'm not

2943.72 --> 2948.91
getting any younger how is it improved

2946.48 --> 2952.2
my life Flat Earth I was flattered

2948.91 --> 2956.2
improved my life well it's very simple I

2952.2 --> 2959.4399999999996
can't be tricked by pieces of [ __ ] like

2956.2 --> 2962.97
you anymore and your demonic spiraling

2959.44 --> 2967.96
lies and a self-deception [ __ ]

2962.97 --> 2971.89
that's how it's a great relief I'm not

2967.96 --> 2976.06
getting pushed around by filth anymore

2971.89 --> 2978.97
and I can make up my own mind and I can

2976.06 --> 2982.33
actually trust it because I haven't been

2978.97 --> 2986.56
polluted by nasty little demon goblins

2982.33 --> 2990.2799999999997
that wield this illusionary Authority

2986.56 --> 2993.13
and that are left to do that by the ones

2990.28 --> 2995.26
that design all this [ __ ] I don't have

2993.13 --> 2998.44
to be subjected to that demonic

2995.26 --> 3002.6600000000003
influence anymore don't have to

2998.44 --> 3006.39
needlessly suffer and be subjected to

3002.66 --> 3010.35
decisions about our worth and sent in to

3006.39 --> 3014.43
some medical gulag system or some other

3010.35 --> 3018.06
type of social shaming punishment for no

3014.43 --> 3020.1
damn good reason yeah that's what Flat

3018.06 --> 3023.85
Earth has done for me and I'm not

3020.1 --> 3026.5699999999997
getting any younger but thank God that I

3023.85 --> 3029.8199999999997
know this [ __ ] thank God

3026.57 --> 3033.81
because otherwise I would feel freaking

3029.82 --> 3038.73
old and miserable and I'd hate myself

3033.81 --> 3041.7599999999998
and yeah I used to be like that not

3038.73 --> 3046.7400000000002
super bad but it was bad enough for me

3041.76 --> 3050.28
that it drives me crazy that it would

3046.74 --> 3054.18
really hurt me but yeah I figured out

3050.28 --> 3057.51
even at my late teens like okay it seems

3054.18 --> 3059.52
like it's gonna go really bad but I can

3057.51 --> 3062.8500000000004
figure a way out it's just gonna take

3059.52 --> 3064.83
some time have to slowly step away as it

3062.85 --> 3067.7999999999997
seems to go out of control slowly step

3064.83 --> 3070.83
away and very gradually slowly grow

3067.8 --> 3074.19
slowly attain the truth that I've been

3070.83 --> 3076.92
trying to avoid and I've avoided a lot

3074.19 --> 3078.32
and I knew that I felt it and it's like

3076.92 --> 3081.03
bad news

3078.32 --> 3084.69
start to feel very hostile towards the

3081.03 --> 3086.28
world the more you ignore right and I

3084.69 --> 3089.01
stepped away from that and I gradually

3086.28 --> 3091.9500000000003
grew out of it and it took me some time

3089.01 --> 3096.09
before I could kind of find the courage

3091.95 --> 3099.1499999999996
to actually openly just start saying the

3096.09 --> 3103.67
truth out there on camera man you can't

3099.15 --> 3110.1600000000003
imagine how much courage that [ __ ] takes

3103.67 --> 3112.05
and the fear of reprisal now I'm not as

3110.16 --> 3113.8199999999997
afraid anymore because I just figured

3112.05 --> 3118.65
out that most people out there really

3113.82 --> 3120.63
are just a bunch of [ __ ] and sneaky

3118.65 --> 3124.05
backstabbers that don't actually do

3120.63 --> 3129.54
anything they just try to fool around

3124.05 --> 3133.05
and get in your face and in a way it's

3129.54 --> 3134.55
almost a disappointment but is what it

3133.05 --> 3136.5
is but yeah

3134.55 --> 3138.8700000000003
flat earth got me a lot and I'm not

3136.5 --> 3143.94
getting any younger it's true but at

3138.87 --> 3146.7
least I'm not growing old from all the

3143.94 --> 3148.9500000000003
pollution and all the bad feelings

3146.7 --> 3154.23
towards myself that I used to have

3148.95 --> 3157.1099999999997
because I was on the other side yeah so

3154.23 --> 3159.88
funny isn't it how do I they think they

3157.11 --> 3162.4300000000003
can hurt people with that question

3159.88 --> 3167.9500000000003
because they really can't see it they

3162.43 --> 3171.12
can't see it they don't understand they

3167.95 --> 3174.12
don't have this feeling of time even

3171.12 --> 3176.5899999999997
even the time sensor is just kind of

3174.12 --> 3178.9
faded because they keep them stuck in

3176.59 --> 3182.86
their moment because they don't want to

3178.9 --> 3187.12
see what all their choices are actually

3182.86 --> 3191.35
causing on them reflecting on their

3187.12 --> 3193.96
physique because it does and then you

3191.35 --> 3197.31
turn into a demon goblin if you do

3193.96 --> 3197.31
things bad enough

3208.39 --> 3215.44
Oh again Oh it's important is it

3212.2 --> 3217.41
important Jorn up doll again is it

3215.44 --> 3225.5190000000002
important

3217.41 --> 3230.3799999999997
are you important all of a sudden yeah I

3225.519 --> 3234.0389999999998
think that thinks colloquial named as

3230.38 --> 3237.2200000000003
demons are things yeah they're separate

3234.039 --> 3242.71
entities that that dwell pretty much in

3237.22 --> 3245.3089999999997
the spirit world and interact with us in

3242.71 --> 3248.109
the mysterious ways very much

3245.309 --> 3250.63
misunderstood overblown and all kinds of

3248.109 --> 3251.14
changed ways away from how it really

3250.63 --> 3257.13
works

3251.14 --> 3257.1299999999997
yeah absolutely

3263.28 --> 3271.1200000000003
this Zep tepi I'll leave it to you guys

3266.29 --> 3276.64
I think I done enough damage concerning

3271.12 --> 3280.21
George you know it wasn't it wasn't even

3276.64 --> 3282.85
it really meant like that I it's just

3280.21 --> 3286.59
that he did such a shameless backstab I

3282.85 --> 3286.5899999999997
had to punish him properly

3292.549 --> 3298.369
