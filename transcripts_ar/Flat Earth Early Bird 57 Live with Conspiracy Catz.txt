2.84 --> 9.66
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.66 --> 14.73
early-bird number 57

9.66 --> 20.73
I'm your host Arwen and today is very

14.73 --> 23.880000000000003
similar weather to yesterday cloudy not

20.73 --> 27.14
very warm but not very cold either so

23.88 --> 29.82
yeah miles went today

27.14 --> 33.21
let's see yeah I got a lot of people in

29.82 --> 39.14
chat already Thorson some traffic in my

33.21 --> 45.77
rest I had Nick Daniel feels welcome yes

39.14 --> 53.730000000000004
so today could be an interesting day

45.77 --> 57.059000000000005
there are a lot of begging and yeah more

53.73 --> 59.489
begging I've considered to the left

57.059 --> 64.54899999999999
conspiracy cat on

59.489 --> 67.40899999999999
they're very specific conditions and

64.549 --> 70.26
yeah we'll see how that goes but before

67.409 --> 73.32000000000001
I start engaging in that there are some

70.26 --> 77.60000000000001
other subjects I have been laying on my

73.32 --> 85.19999999999999
heart pretty heavily considering

77.6 --> 88.53
environmentalism yeah it's a tough

85.2 --> 89.61
subject because yeah of course there's

88.53 --> 91.8
the crazy

89.61 --> 97.77
climate change hysteria still going on

91.8 --> 101.25
where the vast majority of leftists have

97.77 --> 105.75
let themselves be programmed to become

101.25 --> 111.509
obsessed with carbon dioxide and turn to

105.75 --> 113.399
genocide all approach to solve the

111.509 --> 116.27
problems and this is completely

113.399 --> 118.88
ridiculous it is total waste of time

116.27 --> 122.039
it's idiotic

118.88 --> 124.259
however there's a lot of other problems

122.039 --> 127.77
that are really problems and that was

124.259 --> 133.16
mainly the destruction of nature and the

127.77 --> 135.78
reasons why why governments do this and

133.16 --> 140.45
it usually is because of financial

135.78 --> 147.72
reasons and this is a big big problem

140.45 --> 149.94
problem that we all share and it's a

147.72 --> 153.269
problem that weighs heavily on me and

149.94 --> 156.72
there is now a situation quite urgent

153.269 --> 163.34
currently happening in a very specific

156.72 --> 167.13
location and that is Brazil there is a

163.34 --> 171.0
president right there now that is really

167.13 --> 173.7
really right-wing and to a certain

171.0 --> 177.69
degree I have no problem with that but

173.7 --> 180.209
the problem is and I have not been able

177.69 --> 182.45
to a hundred percent confirm everything

180.209 --> 186.0
about this but I've got it through

182.45 --> 189.73899999999998
liberal sources that I trust that I

186.0 --> 192.329
trust in their judgment at least and I

189.739 --> 193.52
been talking about this for a while over

192.329 --> 197.72
the phone with

193.52 --> 203.38
with that friend that this person is not

197.72 --> 209.15
just a conservative he is apparently a

203.38 --> 212.81
pretty brutal racist yeah and not the

209.15 --> 216.8
classic racist or maybe even including

212.81 --> 219.95
that against Jews or blacks but very

216.8 --> 223.22
specifically against the native tribe

219.95 --> 226.79
people in Brazil the rainforest people

223.22 --> 230.63
and this guy has an irrational hatred

226.79 --> 235.04
for them and there's a lot of people

230.63 --> 239.81
suspecting that he's trying to remove

235.04 --> 243.2
them from history it's a terrible

239.81 --> 245.78
terrible fear and yeah of course I don't

243.2 --> 248.72
know maybe maybe he was even caught

245.78 --> 250.91
saying this in public I don't know I

248.72 --> 253.55
have not seen not that I have not seen a

250.91 --> 255.82999999999998
tape recording about this but if he is

253.55 --> 260.23900000000003
like that then he is not just a

255.83 --> 265.13
right-wing guy he is a Nazi an actual

260.239 --> 268.7
one with the characteristics of erasing

265.13 --> 272.57
history destroying people for Levens

268.7 --> 276.4
helm and including and this is even

272.57 --> 280.58
officially in its presidential plan to

276.4 --> 282.79999999999995
destroy a vast amount of rainforests

280.58 --> 286.78999999999996
over there to make room for more

282.8 --> 289.52000000000004
buildings and more industry goodie what

286.79 --> 293.36
a brilliant idea especially considering

289.52 --> 297.44
that the Amazon where Brazil is a big

293.36 --> 301.46000000000004
part of has these unique swamps and

297.44 --> 303.95
waterways unique to this world very very

301.46 --> 305.44
delicate very complicated that are

303.95 --> 311.86
considered the lungs of

305.44 --> 315.01
well because probably a noticeable

311.86 --> 317.23
percentage of the world's oxygen is

315.01 --> 320.94
being transformed within these swamps

317.23 --> 324.13
and it is also one of the more unique

320.94 --> 326.62
pollutant cleaners and transformers it

324.13 --> 328.75
is you could almost say that it's not

326.62 --> 333.1
just the lungs it is also kind of a

328.75 --> 338.23
kidney of the world and if this is

333.1 --> 340.75
damaged then the consequences cannot be

338.23 --> 343.33000000000004
overseen the environmental destruction

340.75 --> 346.39
that it would cause in the world cannot

343.33 --> 349.41999999999996
be overseen if these swamps get polluted

346.39 --> 352.27
if these swamps get destroyed because if

349.42 --> 354.97
you taint one piece of that swamp then

352.27 --> 356.79999999999995
the entire thing might be tainted like a

354.97 --> 362.70000000000005
long might be tainted with the disease

356.8 --> 366.31
this is incredibly dangerous so yeah

362.7 --> 367.24
where I first fought okay finally some

366.31 --> 370.21
non-liberal

367.24 --> 373.21000000000004
is taking over there and just getting

370.21 --> 375.07
rid of these insane leftists with her

373.21 --> 377.53
climate change crap and their anti

375.07 --> 380.65
humanity but yeah now it seems like he's

377.53 --> 382.98999999999995
been they yeah it's been replaced with

380.65 --> 385.63
somebody that is fanatical in the other

382.99 --> 389.05
direction and that is even more

385.63 --> 393.76
destructive so this is just a shitty

389.05 --> 396.43
situation overall and I think that

393.76 --> 398.98
Brazil has a massive problem and so does

396.43 --> 400.54
the world because what do they want to

398.98 --> 403.0
accomplish with this yeah they want

400.54 --> 406.90000000000003
industry they want self-sufficient sea

403.0 --> 409.18
and because of political reasons now

406.9 --> 412.29999999999995
because this guy is so right-wing the

409.18 --> 414.76
entire world is retracting so they're

412.3 --> 418.419
not getting the financial opportunities

414.76 --> 419.65
as before I guess or the connections

418.419 --> 421.93
although there were the

419.65 --> 425.40999999999997
there what just wasn't that much being

421.93 --> 428.94
done anyway by the left government now

425.41 --> 431.94
they in the development of the country

428.94 --> 431.94
so

432.06 --> 438.51
yeah it's a mess and in my opinion what

435.39 --> 442.77
should be done is get a grip over the

438.51 --> 446.03999999999996
people and then don't freaking destroy

442.77 --> 449.54999999999995
forests but actually start to build some

446.04 --> 451.47
cities some better cities so that all

449.55 --> 455.31
these people don't have to sit in the

451.47 --> 458.01000000000005
outskirts outside of the city in trash

455.31 --> 462.38
heaps much of it that's still going on

458.01 --> 467.37
there get them back in the city and then

462.38 --> 470.79
we yeah get the people in the city you

467.37 --> 473.37
do it get some grip over the situation

470.79 --> 475.8
and then clean out these outer skirts

473.37 --> 479.55
and turn those into farmlands don't

475.8 --> 483.42
freakin destroy forests for more farms

479.55 --> 487.08
on that kind of crap it's absurd clean

483.42 --> 488.79
up what you got and then do it there and

487.08 --> 490.46999999999997
you don't have to really destroy

488.79 --> 492.78000000000003
anything but it does take a lot of

490.47 --> 495.18
planning and it does also take help from

492.78 --> 498.38
the outside world and this is just a

495.18 --> 501.45
problem right now because who is gonna

498.38 --> 504.12
help them financially this is typically

501.45 --> 507.18
something that is done within the

504.12 --> 509.19
globalist ranks if you are a global is

507.18 --> 511.83
the viewer for socialism there suddenly

509.19 --> 514.32
all these outsiders big bankers start

511.83 --> 516.6899999999999
piling money on you and yeah you can get

514.32 --> 519.1500000000001
things done but then that money is

516.69 --> 521.61
completely wasted and just aggravates

519.15 --> 523.86
things but now something really good

521.61 --> 528.12
could be done and they're not helping it

523.86 --> 530.22
is it is a sadistic situation and it

528.12 --> 533.51
makes me really pissed off at all

530.22 --> 536.25
corners of humanity and especially the

533.51 --> 539.91
polarization of politics that has caused

536.25 --> 543.57
this type of scenario to arrive where

539.91 --> 546.42
either things are just wasted or if

543.57 --> 548.5500000000001
something actually constructively is in

546.42 --> 553.65
the works then it's going to be stopped

548.55 --> 556.8499999999999
and more destruction has to be cost to

553.65 --> 559.1
get it done it is unbearable

556.85 --> 564.259
it is totally unbearable to me and it

559.1 --> 566.899
must stop this [ __ ] must stop sick of it

564.259 --> 569.569
I'm sick of the extreme right-wing

566.899 --> 572.259
approach and I'm sick of the extreme

569.569 --> 575.36
left-wing approach and this must stop

572.259 --> 578.6
because everybody everything is going to

575.36 --> 581.69
be destroyed not just humanity also

578.6 --> 585.38
freaking mother okay liberals with your

581.69 --> 588.0500000000001
stupid Gaia worship yeah what you're

585.38 --> 591.97
doing you may think it is somehow

588.05 --> 596.209
postponing things but you could actually

591.97 --> 597.74
actually transform things with your

596.209 --> 602.4799999999999
capacities with your connections with

597.74 --> 604.79
your money instead you're contributing

602.48 --> 607.25
to the absolute destruction of

604.79 --> 609.05
everything do you understand do you

607.25 --> 612.319
understand that this is happening

609.05 --> 618.55
because of this political insanity from

612.319 --> 621.38
your side okay and the other side yeah

618.55 --> 625.639
they're doing whatever they seem

621.38 --> 628.55
necessary to survive and they have more

625.639 --> 635.12
legitimacy to it you're not doing that

628.55 --> 638.0889999999999
you're just causing [ __ ] it's bad stop

635.12 --> 641.509
being an idiot liberal and actually be

638.089 --> 644.12
an actual liberal a real one a classic

641.509 --> 646.279
one take care of your environment seek

644.12 --> 651.7090000000001
balance seek harmony between man and

646.279 --> 655.3389999999999
nature and gather and spread real wisdom

651.709 --> 658.029
and not mind control [ __ ] that is being

655.339 --> 665.3190000000001
handed down by a corporate structure

658.029 --> 665.319
stop this madness okay stop it

665.84 --> 668.529
so

668.74 --> 672.66
just need to get that off my chest

673.68 --> 680.2399999999999
the situation in Brazil is is very tense

680.67 --> 686.43
yeah this guy even had an assassination

683.64 --> 689.28
attempt against him a retrospect that's

686.43 --> 691.68
not all that strange considering the

689.28 --> 695.55
things that he has been saying and doing

691.68 --> 698.25
in public they think this is also

695.55 --> 700.8299999999999
official that he's even said that he

698.25 --> 702.69
wouldn't mind if the entire country went

700.83 --> 707.01
back to the old-fashioned military

702.69 --> 709.2600000000001
dictatorship so yeah that's a comforting

707.01 --> 711.84
thought right because everything was so

709.26 --> 719.01
great during that time Brazil was doing

711.84 --> 722.25
so great not so pay attention pay

719.01 --> 725.09
attention to the real problems and find

722.25 --> 729.48
real solutions stop the politicization

725.09 --> 736.77
madness get together because you have to

729.48 --> 742.02
and fix the situation and just fix it if

736.77 --> 745.56
you can and stop obsessing over

742.02 --> 748.8
political [ __ ] get to the real problems

745.56 --> 752.9399999999999
and fix them and not some stupid

748.8 --> 754.9499999999999
ideology or mind-control [ __ ] or even a

752.94 --> 758.7
religious doctrine even if you think

754.95 --> 763.23
that's good stop the mind control let

758.7 --> 767.25
people make individual decisions and

763.23 --> 772.98
growth and just focus on repairing

767.25 --> 775.62
things and not on trying to mind-control

772.98 --> 778.0500000000001
or even the program mind control I guess

775.62 --> 781.14
to some degree that is good to just show

778.05 --> 783.6899999999999
the mind control that is good but don't

781.14 --> 785.49
try to replace the governmental

783.69 --> 789.2600000000001
structure with another type of mind

785.49 --> 789.26
control stop it

791.83 --> 802.69
Oh anyway yeah I am gonna get conspiracy

797.02 --> 803.62
cats in on the panel I'll see where it

802.69 --> 807.61
goes from there

803.62 --> 809.74
I'm already given him a warning to stop

807.61 --> 814.51
sucking up to me I respond to that

809.74 --> 815.17
really badly so we'll see where this

814.51 --> 817.12
goes

815.17 --> 821.16
I don't know where it's gonna go I might

817.12 --> 823.69
up and yeah just kicking him because

821.16 --> 825.64
just getting too annoyed or something I

823.69 --> 830.1
don't know what's gonna happen but I've

825.64 --> 832.42
given him my rules for this show and

830.1 --> 838.26
we'll see where it goes so I'm gonna

832.42 --> 838.26
send him a hangout link right now

852.56 --> 860.3299999999999
right okay

858.47 --> 864.4
I'm gonna lick it take a look at chat

860.33 --> 864.4000000000001
again people's not yelling

889.86 --> 900.13
yeah I do worry about the environment a

892.93 --> 904.2399999999999
lot I always have and when first climate

900.13 --> 907.03
change came up or well first global

904.24 --> 910.09
warming and the ozone layer thing came

907.03 --> 911.92
up I went with that but yeah global

910.09 --> 913.99
warming just turned out to be total

911.92 --> 916.8399999999999
horseshit didn't work

913.99 --> 918.46
it wasn't the predictor yet it's based

916.84 --> 919.75
on predictions that aren't happening

918.46 --> 923.2900000000001
it's idiotic

919.75 --> 925.9
it's not real it's presuppositional

923.29 --> 928.12
reasoning and it's stupid it's not

925.9 --> 930.79
working out statistically and then

928.12 --> 932.77
climate change came along and yeah

930.79 --> 934.7199999999999
constantly predictions all over the

932.77 --> 935.59
place in all directions and it's not

934.72 --> 938.59
happening

935.59 --> 942.36
so that's stupid and it's a distraction

938.59 --> 946.48
it's a giant distraction and financial

942.36 --> 950.65
attempts to create neo feudalism through

946.48 --> 954.61
corporations and forced by by government

950.65 --> 958.42
and it's stupid and there should be a

954.61 --> 960.28
focus on just getting rid of poisons or

958.42 --> 966.37
enough poisons are the food getting rid

960.28 --> 969.51
of poisons out of the industry and from

966.37 --> 972.64
we have preferably transforming some

969.51 --> 974.17
actual toxins into less damaging

972.64 --> 977.68
substances working on some

974.17 --> 980.14
transformations of poisons and clean up

977.68 --> 982.8
the world for real because it's a

980.14 --> 987.62
problem micro plastics are a problem

982.8 --> 991.04
toxic waste buildup is a problem

987.62 --> 994.1
side products from from oil production

991.04 --> 995.75
is a problem these are all problems that

994.1 --> 998.99
need to be worked on that need to be

995.75 --> 1003.15
solved not by taking it away by

998.99 --> 1003.15
preventing it from happening but by

1004.17 --> 1013.86
progressing the chemistry learning more

1009.1 --> 1017.44
about it and finding a way to chemically

1013.86 --> 1019.779
neutralize toxic side products and

1017.44 --> 1023.5
potentially find a new constructive

1019.779 --> 1026.65
purpose for them that's not as insane as

1023.5 --> 1028.87
like putting sodium fluoride waste

1026.65 --> 1032.76
product in water for some insane reason

1028.87 --> 1035.8
that is totally idiotic don't do that

1032.76 --> 1039.819
after to neutralize the poisons for real

1035.8 --> 1041.85
and then we got a real solution that is

1039.819 --> 1044.02
that should be the focus of all

1041.85 --> 1047.4099999999999
environmentalism both that and

1044.02 --> 1050.8899999999999
protecting nature protecting the forests

1047.41 --> 1054.49
protecting rainforests especially but

1050.89 --> 1056.14
also protecting aquatic wildlife and

1054.49 --> 1059.67
these are things that I focus on a lot

1056.14 --> 1067.26
and just that's just

1059.67 --> 1069.71
it needs protection so yeah I'm still

1067.26 --> 1069.71

1303.74 --> 1315.99
subscribing the other day GFB 45 what

1312.48 --> 1320.16
low volume or almost with my face

1315.99 --> 1322.559
directly in front of it and it's set to

1320.16 --> 1324.48
a hundred fifty percent output so it's

1322.559 --> 1326.76
not gonna be any louder unfortunately

1324.48 --> 1329.64
unless you want me to like eat the mic

1326.76 --> 1337.2
and just constantly talk very loud and

1329.64 --> 1339.8700000000001
Scratchy so that's nothing that but I am

1337.2 --> 1342.48
aware that the volume output of my show

1339.87 --> 1345.51
is on average lower than with typical

1342.48 --> 1349.17
other videos so yeah I am gonna try to

1345.51 --> 1351.559
fix this with audio banana as advice and

1349.17 --> 1355.8000000000002
fortunately I apparently need to buy

1351.559 --> 1358.01
something for that to possum to maneuver

1355.8 --> 1358.01
that

1461.92 --> 1474.26

enemy again and he actually had the

1657.95 --> 1664.4
balls to tell me on skype okay and I'm

1661.7 --> 1668.38
actually gonna present that because I

1664.4 --> 1673.2800000000002

1668.38 --> 1676.7600000000002
right because I refuse to let him on my

1673.28 --> 1681.26
panel with conspiracy cats I am

1676.76 --> 1683.53

1704.0 --> 1710.03
away with slander and idiocy and you

1707.39 --> 1712.73
need to trust that you can't start

1710.03 --> 1714.86
whining to me about censorship because I

1712.73 --> 1718.6
don't let you on the panel under certain

1714.86 --> 1721.61
conditions okay this is my freakin show

1718.6 --> 1724.8799999999999
okay if you wanna be with conspiracy

1721.61 --> 1728.4499999999998
cats on a channel then why don't you try

1724.88 --> 1729.44
to get him in a panel with you oh that's

1728.45 --> 1734.44
not gonna happen

1729.44 --> 1737.78
well yeah might be because this kind of

1734.44 --> 1741.6200000000001
zealous attitude you know because I know

1737.78 --> 1743.81
where this guy is I've heard you about

1741.62 --> 1746.4799999999998
him and I know that there are some

1743.81 --> 1751.1
serious issues with this guy and I'm not

1746.48 --> 1755.96
gonna pretend like nothing's going on

1751.1 --> 1760.37
okay so stop being such a [ __ ] about

1755.96 --> 1765.08
this and just let me do my show and stop

1760.37 --> 1767.0
excluding yourself making some political

1765.08 --> 1769.61
statements because you're not getting

1767.0 --> 1774.13
your way stop being such a childish

1769.61 --> 1778.2099999999998
[ __ ] seriously sick of it

1780.669 --> 1786.13
you can whine about him if you like I'll

1782.77 --> 1788.559

1786.13 --> 1790.0590000000002
and I'm not actually gonna allow him the

1788.559 --> 1794.3799999999999
same so I'm giving you preferential

1790.059 --> 1796.9289999999999
treatment so don't open your smartass

1794.38 --> 1799.24
mouth about how you're now gonna avoid

1796.929 --> 1803.41
me or whatever yeah because if you're

1799.24 --> 1806.38
gonna be like that then [ __ ] off I don't

1803.41 --> 1808.0900000000001
need people that act like this okay and

1806.38 --> 1811.5390000000002
they need your freaking political

1808.09 --> 1814.049
maneuvering okay go away if you don't

1811.539 --> 1814.049
like it

1818.27 --> 1823.45
my ways big chance he's not even coming

1821.0 --> 1823.45
on so

1845.74 --> 1852.11
and seriously

1847.4 --> 1854.8400000000001
do I like being on the same side with

1852.11 --> 1857.09
you but I don't like this freaking

1854.84 --> 1859.8799999999999
political maneuvering you're constantly

1857.09 --> 1861.309
pulling I don't like to be manipulated

1859.88 --> 1864.5800000000002
okay

1861.309 --> 1864.58
sick of it

1872.539 --> 1879.769
yeah yeah I bet he's smiling no I'm not

1876.979 --> 1886.209
smiling because he's not actually coming

1879.769 --> 1886.209
on OK that's also a telltale sign

1888.58 --> 1900.47
so but I'll give him 50 more minutes and

1895.3 --> 1902.8
if he doesn't show up I'll just call him

1900.47 --> 1902.8
a coward

1905.9 --> 1910.3600000000001

1995.71 --> 2002.1000000000001
alright how's that that's quiet isn't it

1998.309 --> 2009.6789999999999
how's that now is that I'm asking the

2002.1 --> 2014.07
audience now right okay it seems okay oh

2009.679 --> 2016.529
all right so okay yeah you've been you

2014.07 --> 2017.96
and waz I've been asking you to come on

2016.529 --> 2021.6
for a while now

2017.96 --> 2026.73
it's getting kind of annoyed by it

2021.6 --> 2031.26
so yeah what I like your show you know I

2026.73 --> 2032.669
like I mean I'll be back working Arden

2031.26 --> 2034.47
it so if I won't get chance to listen to

2032.669 --> 2035.94
it much but while I've been off you know

2034.47 --> 2036.96
I've enjoy listen to it every day it's

2035.94 --> 2039.5
been it's been good

2036.96 --> 2039.5
really

2040.94 --> 2047.0900000000001
you listen to my show every day so

2044.08 --> 2049.13
that's interesting can you give me some

2047.09 --> 2051.5299999999997
feedback about some of the subjects I've

2049.13 --> 2054.77
treated in detail what do you find

2051.53 --> 2057.2000000000003
interesting about it I find in to the

2054.77 --> 2059.72
fact that the tone of the debate is a

2057.2 --> 2061.97
lot better than other shows that might

2059.72 --> 2065.33
be out there you know it seems I know it

2061.97 --> 2067.5699999999997
wasn't been on a lot and you know I know

2065.33 --> 2069.86
you perhaps haven't had many other

2067.57 --> 2071.48
ballers on it as you call of it and

2069.86 --> 2074.42
that's that's a shame be nice we have

2071.48 --> 2075.8
people all like that but it's just good

2074.42 --> 2078.44
easy background it's been for me it was

2075.8 --> 2081.05
important about absolutely mm-hmm well

2078.44 --> 2083.96
the issue about ballers is is this is

2081.05 --> 2085.88
not a flat earth debate set up so not

2083.96 --> 2089.51
everything goes it's as simple as that

2085.88 --> 2092.4500000000003
and look there so many only so many

2089.51 --> 2095.11
ballers that I come across that actually

2092.45 --> 2098.5699999999997
just know how to behave

2095.11 --> 2100.4900000000002
so the problem is yeah there's a couple

2098.57 --> 2103.34
of people that I kind of trusted just

2100.49 --> 2106.1299999999997
behave and have a civil conversation but

2103.34 --> 2108.11
with yeah a great many of them as soon

2106.13 --> 2110.6
as you start to trigger them or somebody

2108.11 --> 2114.4700000000003
makes a smartass remark or anything then

2110.6 --> 2117.23
they'll just start yeah doing the the

2114.47 --> 2120.5
standard constant obfuscation [ __ ] and

2117.23 --> 2122.33
just end up trolling and yeah I don't

2120.5 --> 2124.91
want my show to be anything like that

2122.33 --> 2127.73
I'm not here to like oh look at how

2124.91 --> 2131.48
crazy the ballers get which is part of

2127.73 --> 2133.76
Nathan's show and yeah he's right baller

2131.48 --> 2135.8
do get crazy so that does happen but

2133.76 --> 2137.4500000000003
that's not what my show is for my show

2135.8 --> 2140.27
is mostly for getting a better

2137.45 --> 2145.6
understanding of things and actually

2140.27 --> 2145.6
communicating so that's the difference

2146.71 --> 2151.61
not everybody is good for that like I

2149.81 --> 2153.59
could already predict what would happen

2151.61 --> 2156.38
if I for example would let her hump us

2153.59 --> 2159.3500000000004
on this show although that would seem

2156.38 --> 2160.76
kind of amusing well as you know for ten

2159.35 --> 2167.27
minutes and after that it's just

2160.76 --> 2170.63
downhill but I think the way you do

2167.27 --> 2173.2
speaks people bring he's gonna bring out

2170.63 --> 2173.2000000000003
the best in people

2174.109 --> 2179.66
you have a really good conversation

2175.989 --> 2184.9700000000003
alright I do try to approach in a more

2179.66 --> 2187.8799999999997
civil way basically approaching it from

2184.97 --> 2189.769
the angle where I consider that yeah

2187.88 --> 2192.71
you're not doing you're not believing

2189.769 --> 2195.109
these things or even doing the tricks as

2192.71 --> 2198.489
part of the religion for devious reasons

2195.109 --> 2201.739
but you do it just by instinct because

2198.489 --> 2203.029
yeah you're caught up in it it's part of

2201.739 --> 2207.23
what you've become

2203.029 --> 2209.21
and that is the worldwide thing so yeah

2207.23 --> 2212.18
I don't approach it I approach try to

2209.21 --> 2216.859
approach it more constructively and it

2212.18 --> 2220.94
does help but I will absolutely delve

2216.859 --> 2224.799
into the core arguments and and I will

2220.94 --> 2228.829
try to not let it end up into yelling

2224.799 --> 2232.009
but I will absolutely just like Nathan

2228.829 --> 2234.98
does except maybe not with as much

2232.009 --> 2237.529
dominance and aggression shove the

2234.98 --> 2241.009
foundational arguments including the

2237.529 --> 2244.19
psychological ones in everyone's face

2241.009 --> 2247.309
including my guests so you have to be

2244.19 --> 2248.869
prepared for that I think that that's

2247.309 --> 2252.0190000000002
perfect you know because at the end of

2248.869 --> 2252.9500000000003
the day I mean some people are in this

2252.019 --> 2255.0789999999997
because they like the entertainment

2252.95 --> 2256.759
alright some people are in it because

2255.079 --> 2258.829
they just want to prove to everybody

2256.759 --> 2261.289
else there I and some people are in it

2258.829 --> 2263.6600000000003
because they want to do you want to

2261.289 --> 2265.4
actually progress in their understanding

2263.66 --> 2267.6189999999997
and come to a conclusion

2265.4 --> 2268.819
mm-hm I think the way the way you've

2267.619 --> 2272.9
described it then that's going to help

2268.819 --> 2275.63
people come to a conclusion I mean

2272.9 --> 2279.109
conclusion well yeah well there's a lot

2275.63 --> 2283.809
of conclusions already and they're being

2279.109 --> 2287.269
avoided they're being so yeah obfuscated

2283.809 --> 2289.3390000000004
circumvented right now and that's yeah

2287.269 --> 2292.089
we have been on top of the city yeah you

2289.339 --> 2295.16
might deny this but the flat earth is us

2292.089 --> 2296.9
we're still fooling around in the

2295.16 --> 2298.73
details here and they're trying to get

2296.9 --> 2301.579
things straight trying to be certain

2298.73 --> 2303.48
about how what's going on but we got the

2301.579 --> 2305.76
biggest core arguments in place

2303.48 --> 2309.69
and there's really nothing you guys can

2305.76 --> 2313.6200000000003
do about it except just spin around and

2309.69 --> 2315.84
just try to somehow find a way and if

2313.62 --> 2317.64
it's not working then in the blur just

2315.84 --> 2322.65
forget about it that's basically what's

2317.64 --> 2325.41
going on continually and yeah you might

2322.65 --> 2328.44
disagree about that because of course it

2325.41 --> 2332.8199999999997
touches upon a very very overarching

2328.44 --> 2337.5
sensitive subject that nobody would like

2332.82 --> 2341.4300000000003
to agree to from your perspective but

2337.5 --> 2343.53
yeah it is going on and it's become more

2341.43 --> 2345.4199999999996
about psychology now than about the

2343.53 --> 2346.4300000000003
actual technical aspects of the

2345.42 --> 2349.38
cosmogony

2346.43 --> 2352.1099999999997
it really has because all the details

2349.38 --> 2354.12
are pretty much out there now we have

2352.11 --> 2359.07
figured out optics we have figured out

2354.12 --> 2361.47
the presuppositional systems and the

2359.07 --> 2363.57
Astronomy the globe of the heavens how

2361.47 --> 2366.54
it behaves the relations to the earth

2363.57 --> 2369.06
all this data is now out in the open for

2366.54 --> 2374.93
everyone to work with who can grasp it

2369.06 --> 2374.93
and I have been doing that so

2375.22 --> 2382.1189999999997
yeah we've already won we really have

2379.74 --> 2384.0989999999997
but it doesn't mean that we're gonna

2382.119 --> 2386.4700000000003
dominate because yeah the culture is

2384.099 --> 2388.9
still the culture and in this case

2386.47 --> 2394.089
culture is based on a democracy

2388.9 --> 2395.29
unfortunately so so what I'm I'm quite

2394.089 --> 2397.599
certain you're talking about that the

2395.29 --> 2399.2799999999997
psychological aspect and you know I hear

2397.599 --> 2401.4100000000003
you when you say you know you've already

2399.28 --> 2405.7900000000004
born then and I believe that you believe

2401.41 --> 2407.68
that a mug so what would your next next

2405.79 --> 2410.23
step be you know if you think like we

2407.68 --> 2411.8489999999997
have all this information what what

2410.23 --> 2416.89
should your next step be what what would

2411.849 --> 2420.46
you do with it well I'd have to approach

2416.89 --> 2423.91
individuals that are very deep in at

2420.46 --> 2427.39
first not so much and then use this

2423.91 --> 2431.319
knowledge of the psychology to show them

2427.39 --> 2433.18
from an objective standpoint from a

2431.319 --> 2436.45
third view perspective which I've

2433.18 --> 2440.47
managed to utilize for myself perfectly

2436.45 --> 2443.4399999999996
but it can be rubbed off by visualising

2440.47 --> 2446.2799999999997
on other people and show them exactly

2443.44 --> 2449.56
what is happening with inside of them

2446.28 --> 2451.5400000000004
while they respond to certain things to

2449.56 --> 2453.91
show them what they consciously do not

2451.54 --> 2455.29
see is proceeding within them because

2453.91 --> 2458.319
they have not learned to put their

2455.29 --> 2461.589
attention on it during that process as

2458.319 --> 2463.9
part of the psychological process and I

2461.589 --> 2465.79
can show them what is happening reveal

2463.9 --> 2468.9900000000002
the inner processes that are hidden from

2465.79 --> 2472.66
their own consciousness and in that way

2468.99 --> 2475.109
force them to deal with what is actually

2472.66 --> 2477.19
going on what they're actually doing and

2475.109 --> 2480.15
give them the choice that take

2477.19 --> 2480.15
responsibility

2480.44 --> 2485.66
so you're talking about approaching a

2482.99 --> 2487.6099999999997
more personal level sort of want would

2485.66 --> 2489.3199999999997
want more interactions you know and

2487.61 --> 2492.8900000000003
that's where you have to go with

2489.32 --> 2493.5800000000004
psychology now don't you so because it

2492.89 --> 2496.8799999999997
is personal

2493.58 --> 2499.2999999999997
the trick is within every person the

2496.88 --> 2501.77
religion is hidden within their

2499.3 --> 2507.11
subconscious the systems are there and

2501.77 --> 2512.98
the system's itself is designed to hide

2507.11 --> 2519.17
itself from the conscious so it's all

2512.98 --> 2521.18
routine so like you took maps like

2519.17 --> 2522.56
friends and family because if you've got

2521.18 --> 2524.27
to do on a one-to-one basis I mean I

2522.56 --> 2527.2999999999997
like listening to your YouTube channel

2524.27 --> 2528.86
but obviously if it's about personal

2527.3 --> 2530.42
interactions you can't really do that

2528.86 --> 2533.54
with the hundreds of people that watch

2530.42 --> 2538.21
you so you can of course you can I do

2533.54 --> 2543.47
and people should not be afraid to

2538.21 --> 2544.88
because it is a good transformation so

2543.47 --> 2548.6899999999996
where would you what would you start so

2544.88 --> 2550.1
there's somebody who is completely new

2548.69 --> 2551.51
to the Flat Earth tour and hasn't heard

2550.1 --> 2553.58
any of the arguments hasn't heard

2551.51 --> 2558.4100000000003
anything just just as grown up you know

2553.58 --> 2560.87
like any any normal guy that's a

2558.41 --> 2562.8799999999997
completely different approach that's a

2560.87 --> 2564.44
completely different approach to what

2562.88 --> 2568.04
people like you that are in these

2564.44 --> 2569.87
circles of bowler fanatics new people

2568.04 --> 2574.94
are completely different they only have

2569.87 --> 2577.4
certain conditionings routed in from the

2574.94 --> 2580.37
standard media culture and school what

2577.4 --> 2583.34
they learned the basics and they don't

2580.37 --> 2585.14
have much more grip on average and at

2583.34 --> 2587.36
the same time while we have already

2585.14 --> 2591.35
learned how to respond to this through

2587.36 --> 2593.21
the first wave of progression a flat

2591.35 --> 2595.73
earth is against ballers we're all of

2593.21 --> 2598.28
you guys started doing that at first and

2595.73 --> 2601.16
you've progressed somewhat progressed

2598.28 --> 2603.9700000000003
regress it's in a matter of opinion gone

2601.16 --> 2606.85
more into details about modeling and

2603.97 --> 2608.77
difficult Sciences as it were the

2606.85 --> 2611.74
regular public is still on that first

2608.77 --> 2614.71
layer of approach and that's really easy

2611.74 --> 2616.99
for somebody like me and a more

2614.71 --> 2619.62
long-term flat earther that's been into

2616.99 --> 2624.8199999999997
it to respond to this now we have many

2619.62 --> 2626.83
approaches many ways to yeah to take

2624.82 --> 2630.52
care of that to respond to that properly

2626.83 --> 2632.77
and it's a lot easier to wake neutral

2630.52 --> 2634.66
people and newbie people up to it

2632.77 --> 2636.97
although yeah there's still this

2634.66 --> 2639.04
standard a psychological factor and it

2636.97 --> 2641.89
will always be there with some people

2639.04 --> 2645.25
and that is it just takes a lot of time

2641.89 --> 2648.43
to sink in and to transit Justin did as

2645.25 --> 2650.38
a bit with me so even if a person might

2648.43 --> 2652.87
potentially get it that doesn't mean

2650.38 --> 2656.2000000000003
that they will be able to accept it

2652.87 --> 2659.77
right away and it just needs a lot of

2656.2 --> 2661.4199999999996
time and yeah if you realize that Flat

2659.77 --> 2666.22
Earth has been out there for at least

2661.42 --> 2668.62
three years now almost four then you

2666.22 --> 2670.2099999999996
have to also recognize that there is

2668.62 --> 2673.81
going to be a lot of people out there

2670.21 --> 2676.36
that have four years ago three years ago

2673.81 --> 2679.42
two years ago have had that seat planted

2676.36 --> 2683.9500000000003
in them and they are now getting ready

2679.42 --> 2685.48
to go there and that's again going to be

2683.95 --> 2687.6699999999996
more and more and that's one of the

2685.48 --> 2689.44
reasons why we steadily see the Flat

2687.67 --> 2692.44
Earth community growing in all

2689.44 --> 2698.27
directions and because of the controlled

2692.44 --> 2700.52
opposition as well which is also growing

2698.27 --> 2703.67
see the controlled opposition still I

2700.52 --> 2705.5
know that's something I get accused of

2703.67 --> 2708.2000000000003
being so quite a lot I know you know the

2705.5 --> 2709.73
reality is I'm just a guy in in a little

2708.2 --> 2711.47
back room somewhere in the house you

2709.73 --> 2715.369
know with some details and go make a

2711.47 --> 2717.5299999999997
video then uh so I didn't mean

2715.369 --> 2719.4500000000003
controlled opposition from the baller

2717.53 --> 2722.1800000000003
versus Flat Earth perspective because

2719.45 --> 2724.7
that is the politicization on its own

2722.18 --> 2726.83
almost I'm talking about controlled

2724.7 --> 2729.2599999999998
opposition flat earthers fake flat

2726.83 --> 2732.23
earthers so that nobody knows that are

2729.26 --> 2736.2200000000003
having super popular videos while acting

2732.23 --> 2740.21
like complete morons that is controlled

2736.22 --> 2742.25
opposition and there is there is a lot

2740.21 --> 2746.42
of that out there right now and it's

2742.25 --> 2749.57
been growing fast so I'm starting to put

2746.42 --> 2753.53
number real flat earthers in the video

2749.57 --> 2756.32
and when you say control you saying that

2753.53 --> 2757.6400000000003
and they are just as ended acting as

2756.32 --> 2759.92
individuals who are deliberately

2757.64 --> 2763.0699999999997
trolling or are you saying that there is

2759.92 --> 2767.54
like an agency above that's paid actors

2763.07 --> 2769.67
low great actors that are just paid to

2767.54 --> 2770.7799999999997
do this and yet they want a job they

2769.67 --> 2773.089
want money they don't give a [ __ ]

2770.78 --> 2775.07
they're actors so okay I have to act

2773.089 --> 2776.869
like a stupid flat earther okay give me

2775.07 --> 2778.94
my script I'll act like a stupid flutter

2776.869 --> 2780.589
there I don't give a [ __ ] I think

2778.94 --> 2782.66
there's a lot of these people out there

2780.589 --> 2784.73
because there's a lot of actors out

2782.66 --> 2787.3999999999996
there in the world that want to be

2784.73 --> 2789.77
actors and yeah they will want to go to

2787.4 --> 2792.56
Hollywood or whatever or something and

2789.77 --> 2794.359
many of them don't get this opportunity

2792.56 --> 2798.23
so there are just a lot of unemployed

2794.359 --> 2800.2999999999997
actors it's only natural that if you

2798.23 --> 2802.97
want to contain the flat earth for

2800.3 --> 2806.1800000000003
financial reasons culturally that you

2802.97 --> 2808.609
are gonna hire unemployed actors out

2806.18 --> 2811.3689999999997
there to get on social media and act

2808.609 --> 2813.2599999999998
like flat earthers to stave off

2811.369 --> 2815.8
newcomers to discourage them from

2813.26 --> 2818.8390000000004
engaging into looking into Flat Earth

2815.8 --> 2821.0890000000004
absolutely and that has nothing to do

2818.839 --> 2822.89
with you ballers by the way that's a

2821.089 --> 2824.69
separate case I think that you are on

2822.89 --> 2828.15
your own journey with your own risks

2824.69 --> 2835.9900000000002
especially the politicization and the

2828.15 --> 2839.05
moral boundary breaking aspects that you

2835.99 --> 2841.9599999999996
are engaging in for out of religious

2839.05 --> 2844.3300000000004
fanaticism or enthusiasm however you

2841.96 --> 2846.94
want to see that that is your danger and

2844.33 --> 2849.64
I think that there's just a lot of stuff

2846.94 --> 2854.37
happening it within the the real baller

2849.64 --> 2859.8399999999997
group that is just bad it's bad for you

2854.37 --> 2862.12
it's not helping like oh well also god I

2859.84 --> 2865.15
don't even know about you specifically

2862.12 --> 2866.98
in this case although I've had you did

2865.15 --> 2870.37
get caught in a couple of very devious

2866.98 --> 2872.38
things maybe on the small scale and some

2870.37 --> 2875.47
on the bigger scale that's your own

2872.38 --> 2881.25
problem I don't let ya watch your hands

2875.47 --> 2884.8799999999997
to be fair so I don't do hangouts really

2881.25 --> 2889.51
yeah I don't I don't really do that goes

2884.88 --> 2890.71
right in in terms of the and what I'm

2889.51 --> 2892.2400000000002
not gonna do is ask you to start

2890.71 --> 2894.82
throwing accusations around and naming

2892.24 --> 2897.1
people but have you personally like met

2894.82 --> 2898.63
someone or like had online chat with

2897.1 --> 2900.91
someone and then come away afterwards

2898.63 --> 2903.28
and thought you know I think that person

2900.91 --> 2908.17
is like controlled opposition oh yeah

2903.28 --> 2910.42
oh yeah and well I'm not ask you to name

2908.17 --> 2912.2200000000003
the but I'm assuming that there is a

2910.42 --> 2915.84
general consensus of who isn't there

2912.22 --> 2919.4399999999996
isn't out there right

2915.84 --> 2924.59
so yeah well I think that there's a very

2919.44 --> 2929.37
superficial approach in this among look

2924.59 --> 2932.46
no cultural group flat earth baller the

2929.37 --> 2935.85
outer world the rest of the public has

2932.46 --> 2938.63
all of them have problems sizing up

2935.85 --> 2942.54
situations and among flat earthers it

2938.63 --> 2946.37
the wider I guess the more general dumb

2942.54 --> 2949.92
version sorry to be known about that are

2946.37 --> 2951.96
very have this tendency to just who

2949.92 --> 2953.82
everybody says she'll or oh you must be

2951.96 --> 2957.9900000000002
controlled opposition or oh you are so

2953.82 --> 2962.25
popular you must be a controller this

2957.99 --> 2964.5
type of paranoia and in a sense that is

2962.25 --> 2968.04
a natural response because part of

2964.5 --> 2972.3
flatter is really figuring out how fast

2968.04 --> 2974.73
the lies are and that they reach in so

2972.3 --> 2978.36
many things and that does tend to make

2974.73 --> 2980.43
one paranoid but when you let it all

2978.36 --> 2983.79
sink and you get used to it you'll start

2980.43 --> 2986.49
to notice that it is mostly all designed

2983.79 --> 2990.32
within compartmentalization structures

2986.49 --> 2993.5899999999997
and that means that the lie is not known

2990.32 --> 2997.44
by all parts most are just following

2993.59 --> 3000.86
instructions and there is actually only

2997.44 --> 3002.42
a small group that need to really know

3000.86 --> 3004.6400000000003
what's going on because there are the

3002.42 --> 3007.55
designers of these control structures

3004.64 --> 3009.1099999999997
and the rest is all compartmentalization

3007.55 --> 3010.7000000000003
that's somebody that that's something

3009.11 --> 3013.9100000000003
that most people just really need to

3010.7 --> 3016.5499999999997
realize that some people may be talking

3013.91 --> 3018.95
to them giving them propaganda but

3016.55 --> 3021.5
that's not because they know it's a lie

3018.95 --> 3025.1
and they want to give it to you but

3021.5 --> 3027.89
because they're just told or they feel

3025.1 --> 3029.9
or they somehow feel impulsively that

3027.89 --> 3032.42
they need to do it and not really know

3029.9 --> 3035.4500000000003
whether it be true or false or not

3032.42 --> 3036.69
caring and just feel the need to do it

3035.45 --> 3039.1189999999997
anyway you

3036.69 --> 3042.54
they need to protect their hierarchy or

3039.119 --> 3045.359
something while not actually knowing if

3042.54 --> 3047.73
it is true or not this is very important

3045.359 --> 3053.4
as I said most of these things that are

3047.73 --> 3057.63
happening are psychological and I don't

3053.4 --> 3060.78
think that everybody knows about the

3057.63 --> 3062.9700000000003
control structures I think it's left out

3060.78 --> 3067.5890000000004
the knowledge of the truth is left out

3062.97 --> 3069.8689999999997
as much as possible it's more about the

3067.589 --> 3073.47
control structure and about the

3069.869 --> 3079.76
narrative than it is about the truth for

3073.47 --> 3083.22
the controllers right so how would you

3079.76 --> 3086.8190000000004
how would you have you have you come to

3083.22 --> 3089.43
the conclusion that there's a so like a

3086.819 --> 3091.14
governing body of it like what ties all

3089.43 --> 3093.75
these people together I know you said

3091.14 --> 3097.95
you know the uniform design it's very

3093.75 --> 3101.339
simple the way that narratives spread

3097.95 --> 3103.0789999999997
around and enter all these different

3101.339 --> 3106.38
reaches all these different different

3103.079 --> 3109.8900000000003
arenas simultaneously perfectly

3106.38 --> 3114.48
synchronized that is the sign of an

3109.89 --> 3118.5
absolute control structure it's like you

3114.48 --> 3121.829
can be however you like but you have to

3118.5 --> 3125.849
be part of the structure that's kind of

3121.829 --> 3130.4300000000003
what it feels like on a non individual

3125.849 --> 3130.4300000000003
scale we're on a societal scale I guess

3131.24 --> 3138.18
one thing that I often like really

3135.72 --> 3139.68
wonder with this side of it is obviously

3138.18 --> 3142.41
that the whole kind of network you're

3139.68 --> 3144.81
talking about has to be spread all

3142.41 --> 3149.22
around all across the world that you

3144.81 --> 3152.13
know everyone yes ok and we see so often

3149.22 --> 3155.52
tensions between countries like China or

3152.13 --> 3158.579
Russia and America those Wars etc so it

3155.52 --> 3161.7599999999998
seems to be like a bit of a like it

3158.579 --> 3164.1600000000003
clashes with me the countries across the

3161.76 --> 3165.9500000000003
world can be can be almost enemies with

3164.16 --> 3168.66
each other put in the background also

3165.95 --> 3169.7999999999997
cooperating you know why wouldn't they

3168.66 --> 3172.17
call each other out

3169.8 --> 3176.3700000000003
because then they'd lose their own grip

3172.17 --> 3178.79
over the situation and you must be able

3176.37 --> 3182.37
to account for that for the transition

3178.79 --> 3184.2
that results from that if you don't then

3182.37 --> 3185.58
of course you're not gonna accuse the

3184.2 --> 3190.2
other of the same thing that you are

3185.58 --> 3193.59
doing well except for to standard

3190.2 --> 3195.5699999999997
politics with war and such who is doing

3193.59 --> 3197.55
this well they're of course doing that

3195.57 --> 3199.71
as well that kind of does work but if

3197.55 --> 3203.8500000000004
you're actually going to awaken people

3199.71 --> 3206.52
over there with the truth with the real

3203.85 --> 3209.13
I'll call truth then yeah your people

3206.52 --> 3213.39
are also gonna take note of that that's

3209.13 --> 3216.03
gonna have big consequences so yeah they

3213.39 --> 3220.74
need to uphold it to maintain the

3216.03 --> 3223.4300000000003
structure as it is so they're in it

3220.74 --> 3225.81
whether it's Oh from like a politics

3223.43 --> 3228.1499999999996
point of view I'm assuming that you'd

3225.81 --> 3229.98
then think that you know the president's

3228.15 --> 3235.17
the leaders of these countries are all

3229.98 --> 3238.29
aware of what's going on it's not really

3235.17 --> 3241.5
relevant there are just on a mission

3238.29 --> 3244.4
mostly and they're focused on their

3241.5 --> 3247.88
mission and how to accomplish it so

3244.4 --> 3250.7400000000002
whatever means are available to them so

3247.88 --> 3252.2400000000002
what I mean is like what sort of point

3250.74 --> 3255.39
cuz obviously everybody's born into the

3252.24 --> 3257.6099999999997
world knowing the same stuff which is

3255.39 --> 3259.47
basically nothing you know so at some

3257.61 --> 3261.6600000000003
point the people that are empowered that

3259.47 --> 3263.1899999999996
trying to protect you know the people

3261.66 --> 3265.5899999999997
who are leaving these countries they

3263.19 --> 3267.21
will have to be informed at some point

3265.59 --> 3269.01
that this is going to do I'm saying like

3267.21 --> 3271.89
Donald Trump wasn't born knowing this

3269.01 --> 3275.7000000000003
but at some point in his life he was he

3271.89 --> 3279.2999999999997
was informed of you know that the

3275.7 --> 3281.3399999999997
conspiracy could like and and I guess

3279.3 --> 3284.04
what I'm saying is what maybe has never

3281.34 --> 3285.1200000000003
been an example or wise or not maybe but

3284.04 --> 3287.13
an example is somebody's been on

3285.12 --> 3289.71
informed about that and hasn't wanted to

3287.13 --> 3292.44
go along with it and then you know and

3289.71 --> 3293.4900000000002
it it seems like people are very willing

3292.44 --> 3295.94
to go along with it

3293.49 --> 3295.9399999999996
no I'm saying

3296.41 --> 3304.75
oh I don't know

3301.289 --> 3307.599
sorry might know a little bit no no no

3304.75 --> 3309.369
no no it's just that a lot of people are

3307.599 --> 3312.099
willing to go along with it well yeah

3309.369 --> 3314.799
that's because what's gonna happen when

3312.099 --> 3317.319
you go against it like as you are being

3314.799 --> 3319.5389999999998
informed about this structure if you're

3317.319 --> 3321.009
at that moment gonna say I'm not gonna

3319.539 --> 3323.4700000000003
go along with it yeah guess what's gonna

3321.009 --> 3328.9900000000002
happen you're gonna end up in the gutter

3323.47 --> 3335.68
very fast and that does happen people

3328.99 --> 3338.0789999999997
get kicked out so so people think for a

3335.68 --> 3339.97
fear of what might happen to them well

3338.079 --> 3342.3390000000004
if you want to send in the control

3339.97 --> 3345.3089999999997
structure hierarchy then you have to go

3342.339 --> 3346.93
along otherwise you're gonna fall

3345.309 --> 3351.039
outside of it and you're gonna have to

3346.93 --> 3353.019
figure things out on your own so I I

3351.039 --> 3354.46
mean these are just obvious questions

3353.019 --> 3356.47
that I'm sure you you've heard before

3354.46 --> 3358.059
but let's let's take somebody that's

3356.47 --> 3360.549
been in that position let's take someone

3358.059 --> 3362.7690000000002
who who was born not knowing any of this

3360.549 --> 3364.509
they've risen to a point in power where

3362.769 --> 3366.3689999999997
they've had to be informed about it and

3364.509 --> 3369.039
obviously we're talking about the entire

3366.369 --> 3370.48
world somebody at some point will have

3369.039 --> 3372.579
said no I'm not gonna go along with this

3370.48 --> 3373.9900000000002
and they would have they would have been

3372.579 --> 3377.0190000000002
bumped down and not progressed in life

3373.99 --> 3378.4599999999996
etc and I mean if that was me I I I

3377.019 --> 3379.8089999999997
probably would have spoken out about

3378.46 --> 3383.049
that I think people who have gone to

3379.809 --> 3384.7000000000003
birth you know made an effort to tell

3383.049 --> 3386.2
people look this is what's happened I

3384.7 --> 3389.6189999999997
didn't want to go along with this lie

3386.2 --> 3393.009
and and you know I've been school kid so

3389.619 --> 3396.4900000000002
to speak mm-hmm well they're gonna come

3393.009 --> 3401.71
out how is it gonna come out through

3396.49 --> 3404.2889999999998
media perhaps you think the media is

3401.71 --> 3407.17
gonna do that the media is the

3404.289 --> 3409.599
front-runner upholding the globe image

3407.17 --> 3412.15
in the world you think they're gonna

3409.599 --> 3413.65
just give it to you that this guy just

3412.15 --> 3417.099
said no I'm not gonna go along with it

3413.65 --> 3418.75
no nobody is gonna do that nobody's

3417.099 --> 3420.21
gonna allow that it's gonna be instantly

3418.75 --> 3425.14
removed

3420.21 --> 3427.75
well or maybe not at this point we don't

3425.14 --> 3432.7
know that depends on if they're planning

3427.75 --> 3434.56
to allow it to break down and transform

3432.7 --> 3437.98
the control structure into something new

3434.56 --> 3441.18
that doesn't necessarily rest on the

3437.98 --> 3443.89
globe concept we don't know for sure

3441.18 --> 3446.29
there's a lot of hopes well we don't

3443.89 --> 3448.12
know for sure the signs will show it

3446.29 --> 3453.52
that's gonna be the case

3448.12 --> 3455.77
oh I am these internet but I'm I can't

3453.52 --> 3457.6
follow any of the text chat my computer

3455.77 --> 3459.0099999999998
cuz my roots I'm gonna Nick downstairs

3457.6 --> 3461.0499999999997
I'm gonna restart the router then

3459.01 --> 3462.94
hopefully I can follow the text chatters

3461.05 --> 3464.92
I smell on there on the screen Marley

3462.94 --> 3467.04
speaking to you I'm I tell you exactly

3464.92 --> 3470.62
what is in the chat it's mostly

3467.04 --> 3472.6
complaining as to why I'm not asking

3470.62 --> 3477.97
about gas pressure without a container

3472.6 --> 3482.68
and that kind of thing okay but yeah you

3477.97 --> 3485.8599999999997
know what to do you know that's step up

3482.68 --> 3489.39
to you to respond to all that well I'm

3485.86 --> 3493.4500000000003
actually on the non-sex right oh goody

3489.39 --> 3495.8799999999997
yeah and obviously with with all that

3493.45 --> 3499.0299999999997
I'm expecting that the first question

3495.88 --> 3503.11
that I'm at so you know I mean I'll talk

3499.03 --> 3505.1200000000003
about you know all sorts but I don't

3503.11 --> 3507.52
want to give away my part of who say

3505.12 --> 3510.5499999999997
that the nonsense so tonight we shall

3507.52 --> 3511.6
you know I have asked to the people who

3510.55 --> 3513.73
wanted to know the answer to that

3511.6 --> 3516.43
question but they refused so I'll be

3513.73 --> 3518.92
painting somebody else tonight but I do

3516.43 --> 3521.1699999999996
assume that they will ask me what that

3518.92 --> 3524.41
question is but I'm quite interested in

3521.17 --> 3527.58
the psychology aspect because whenever I

3524.41 --> 3531.2799999999997
have this conversation with people and

3527.58 --> 3533.2
it doesn't get very far you know because

3531.28 --> 3536.11
I'm suddenly accused of being part of

3533.2 --> 3538.5699999999997
the paid opposition you know what I mean

3536.11 --> 3539.7400000000002
and and obviously I know I'm not and

3538.57 --> 3541.36
that's where the conversation so it's

3539.74 --> 3544.3599999999997
interested in you know to listen to that

3541.36 --> 3546.01
but I am I'm gonna be literally 25

3544.36 --> 3549.82
seconds but I run downstairs hit that

3546.01 --> 3551.7400000000002
reason up one is my fine fine I'll be so

3549.82 --> 3556.4500000000003
really nice note

3551.74 --> 3559.1499999999996
okay you are so yeah that's really nice

3556.45 --> 3561.46
conspiracy cats to tell us that he knows

3559.15 --> 3564.46
that he's not a paid agent that must

3561.46 --> 3568.2400000000002
prove it because ya couldn't lie about

3564.46 --> 3570.28
that right yeah but I don't know if he's

3568.24 --> 3574.359
paid maybe it's just a true believer I

3570.28 --> 3577.3300000000004
do know that he does some devious mental

3574.359 --> 3578.98
gymnastics here and there just like the

3577.33 --> 3581.68
most of them because that's being

3578.98 --> 3590.23
allowed just like rumpus does it just

3581.68 --> 3597.24
like soundly does it like the rest so so

3590.23 --> 3602.32
going off next right so can you explain

3597.24 --> 3605.0499999999997
how a gas pressure regular gas not any

3602.32 --> 3607.599
specific type of unique s but the gas

3605.05 --> 3610.599
that we know are on this world present

3607.599 --> 3617.56
that are measured here how that type of

3610.599 --> 3620.38
gas can be well under pressure while in

3617.56 --> 3623.65
another region in another place another

3620.38 --> 3629.32
provable location there is not gas

3623.65 --> 3633.69
pressure but instead of the vacuum yes

3629.32 --> 3638.02
so I'm demonstrating then I'd have to

3633.69 --> 3639.43
I'd have to ask you first why why do you

3638.02 --> 3641.619
think the gamma so see why do you think

3639.43 --> 3643.5099999999998
it's not possible like what is he so I

3641.619 --> 3645.849
can answer questions are satisfied what

3643.51 --> 3649.5400000000004
is the issue it what you what you see is

3645.849 --> 3652.96
problem well the problem is is that if

3649.54 --> 3658.57
you try to emulate this effect to use

3652.96 --> 3661.0
gas pressure logical systems and entropy

3658.57 --> 3664.3
in all of how that works and you model

3661.0 --> 3666.88
this thing called the globe with an

3664.3 --> 3669.19
atmosphere opposing a vast at outer

3666.88 --> 3672.9700000000003
space which is astronomically larger

3669.19 --> 3675.31
that if you model that out yeah it's not

3672.97 --> 3679.089
gonna stay there very long even if you

3675.31 --> 3681.79
would amp up the gravity force into

3679.089 --> 3682.0499999999997
pretty damn high levels where people

3681.79 --> 3684.0
were

3682.05 --> 3686.4300000000003
probably be completely crushed on this

3684.0 --> 3690.48
world and then still there would be

3686.43 --> 3695.91
trouble maintaining a reasonable gas

3690.48 --> 3699.21
pressure as is on this world can't month

3695.91 --> 3703.02
model it can't work it's physically

3699.21 --> 3704.31
impossible to do that but what I hate

3703.02 --> 3705.86
what you're saying I hate you saying

3704.31 --> 3710.61
that you think it's impossible

3705.86 --> 3712.59
specifically what what is not right is

3710.61 --> 3713.73
it the fact that you just think there

3712.59 --> 3716.3700000000003
shouldn't be any atmosphere on the

3713.73 --> 3720.06
planet at all why that's right that's

3716.37 --> 3723.48
right and that's the imposing outer

3720.06 --> 3725.5499999999997
space vacuum and these the suspected

3723.48 --> 3728.34
average pressure the assumed average

3725.55 --> 3730.77
pressure over there upon this small

3728.34 --> 3733.98
surface on this world with the currents

3730.77 --> 3735.24
assumed gravity force if you put all

3733.98 --> 3737.69
these things together and you've

3735.24 --> 3740.7299999999996
simulated it's not gonna stick on there

3737.69 --> 3744.87
it's a myth that that can work if you

3740.73 --> 3746.7
actually model out it doesn't work so

3744.87 --> 3749.73
what what we can do I mean one of the

3746.7 --> 3752.79
things I do very difficult do you deny

3749.73 --> 3754.62
that do we deny that it does not work

3752.79 --> 3761.07
when you actually model it out according

3754.62 --> 3763.47
to the accepted logic oh yeah oh really

3761.07 --> 3770.01
so have you actually seen that have you

3763.47 --> 3772.89
seen it yeah yeah Oh real so how can the

3770.01 --> 3775.38
gravity a constant force a constant

3772.89 --> 3777.6
standard force not it not as the seal or

3775.38 --> 3782.07
anything no barrier how can a constant

3777.6 --> 3784.74
steady force keep a relatively high

3782.07 --> 3786.77
pressure on a small surface within the

3784.74 --> 3791.4799999999996
world while the force will actually

3786.77 --> 3794.27
lessen as Distin goes opposing a massive

3791.48 --> 3799.97
astronomical sized outer space vacuum

3794.27 --> 3803.25
that little force is maybe gonna expand

3799.97 --> 3805.3399999999997
extend the time it takes for it all that

3803.25 --> 3811.74
gas pressure to vent off into space

3805.34 --> 3813.6600000000003
maybe by 0.2 percent of the total time

3811.74 --> 3817.8599999999997
it takes for that to be sucked up into

3813.66 --> 3821.5499999999997
space opposing to no gravity at all it

3817.86 --> 3823.59
doesn't work so because it's a constant

3821.55 --> 3826.2000000000003
pressure it's not being cut off as soon

3823.59 --> 3829.4100000000003
as one part of this gas pressure moves

3826.2 --> 3830.66
out which it will the rest will move

3829.41 --> 3835.35
along with it

3830.66 --> 3837.5699999999997
you can't keep it locked under with a

3835.35 --> 3839.04
force that's not a barrier but this is

3837.57 --> 3840.96
this a constant push there's always

3839.04 --> 3844.2
going to be venting off and that

3840.96 --> 3847.02
instantly will cause the entire gas body

3844.2 --> 3848.5499999999997
to also expand accordingly and just

3847.02 --> 3850.8
continue that process and that's why

3848.55 --> 3854.0600000000004
it's always gonna blow off no matter

3850.8 --> 3858.9300000000003
what you do unless there's a barrier you

3854.06 --> 3860.85
see we do we do absolutely right about

3858.93 --> 3863.3399999999997
that but we also get a lot replenishment

3860.85 --> 3865.29
at the atmosphere so oh no you're not

3863.34 --> 3871.88
listening no no no no I'm not talking

3865.29 --> 3874.5299999999997
about slowly no I'm talking about

3871.88 --> 3877.53
instant displacement as soon as one

3874.53 --> 3880.7400000000002
little bit of gas is this place outside

3877.53 --> 3883.38
of well where the gravity is supposedly

3880.74 --> 3886.79
pulling it down then everything

3883.38 --> 3890.25
simultaneously not slowly we'll move

3886.79 --> 3893.25
with that decrease in pressure towards

3890.25 --> 3895.11
that location causing more instantaneous

3893.25 --> 3897.87
displacement causing more design

3895.11 --> 3900.7400000000002
instantaneous displacement it will be

3897.87 --> 3903.18
instantaneously it will not be gradually

3900.74 --> 3905.49
that's the problem there is not a

3903.18 --> 3907.98
barrier with a small hole through which

3905.49 --> 3911.22
things can escape no it is an open

3907.98 --> 3912.84
system there is no barrier there's just

3911.22 --> 3916.3199999999997
a little force

3912.84 --> 3919.23
apparently present slowly pushing it a

3916.32 --> 3921.0
little bit back slowly opposing the

3919.23 --> 3924.66
actual entropy forces which are

3921.0 --> 3927.66
massively powerful and also even more

3924.66 --> 3930.12
powerful because well the space out

3927.66 --> 3933.87
there is astronomically large compared

3930.12 --> 3935.14
to the space here on earth all these

3933.87 --> 3938.3199999999997
factors

3935.14 --> 3940.18
all these fashion shows how deep you

3938.32 --> 3942.01
want me to go with my response because

3940.18 --> 3944.2
there's no so a 10-second answer to this

3942.01 --> 3946.78
I mean I don't want to end up turning

3944.2 --> 3948.31
your show into a physics lecture and you

3946.78 --> 3951.13
know now you don't need to because I

3948.31 --> 3954.16
just did that I just laid it out

3951.13 --> 3955.42
completely so how how deep join me to go

3954.16 --> 3956.77
I mean how long would you want to spend

3955.42 --> 3958.81
on Mars because obviously these levels

3956.77 --> 3963.73
or levels of the answer no I would just

3958.81 --> 3967.9
like to basically get a foundational

3963.73 --> 3969.85
part of what I said and then well give

3967.9 --> 3971.44
me your opinion about that don't you

3969.85 --> 3975.79
think that all the gas will

3971.44 --> 3977.41
simultaneously fill up whatever is going

3975.79 --> 3978.82
to be missing you think that doesn't

3977.41 --> 3980.95
happen why not

3978.82 --> 3983.86
how could a constant force pushing it

3980.95 --> 3986.71
down without a barrier prevent it from

3983.86 --> 3990.76
all instantaneously escaping how can

3986.71 --> 3993.7
that work well the movement of gas is

3990.76 --> 3997.84
random is it but not no no it's not yeah

3993.7 --> 4001.2599999999998
no it's not random from high pressure to

3997.84 --> 4003.54
low pressure it's not random do is there

4001.26 --> 4004.2000000000003
is a net movement from high pressure to

4003.54 --> 4006.36
low pressure

4004.2 --> 4009.2999999999997
your absolute particles will move

4006.36 --> 4011.2200000000003
randomly in all directions now if it let

4009.3 --> 4013.17
me give you no analogy no look they will

4011.22 --> 4014.73
move from our pressure to high pressure

4013.17 --> 4016.83
high pressure to low pressure

4014.73 --> 4020.34
until an equilibrium is found and then

4016.83 --> 4022.83
there may be some random movements but

4020.34 --> 4030.1400000000003
well there is that the individual

4022.83 --> 4032.37
particles themselves no entropy is first

4030.14 --> 4034.5299999999997
okay well I think I mean that's where

4032.37 --> 4037.47
we're at the very very start

4034.53 --> 4041.73
oh you mean the foundational laws of

4037.47 --> 4043.47
nature of physics the laws laws of

4041.73 --> 4045.39
entropy yeah

4043.47 --> 4049.14
so you disagree with the law of entropy

4045.39 --> 4051.48
that's not very scientific of you I I

4049.14 --> 4053.7599999999998
don't take it so I feel that our

4051.48 --> 4056.88
understanding of that law is different I

4053.76 --> 4058.0800000000004
think if we can't agree that there's

4056.88 --> 4060.87
anything wrong where is it

4058.08 --> 4063.12
I think well here I think if we can't

4060.87 --> 4066.5699999999997
agree that an individual gas particle

4063.12 --> 4066.8599999999997
moves randomly we can't agree at that

4066.57 --> 4068.7200000000003
they

4066.86 --> 4070.04
second level then we're never gonna

4068.72 --> 4072.35
reach the same conclusion it's

4070.04 --> 4074.5099999999998
ridiculous I just already explained to

4072.35 --> 4078.04
you how that works when a particle can

4074.51 --> 4080.9900000000002
remove randomly after entropy has found

4078.04 --> 4082.73
cause the entire gas body to find its

4080.99 --> 4085.7
equilibrium within the container

4082.73 --> 4089.9
available that is when random movement

4085.7 --> 4091.64
can happen but the rush of entropy for a

4089.9 --> 4094.01
gas pressure to find its equilibrium

4091.64 --> 4097.73
will be first and everything will

4094.01 --> 4101.150000000001
uniformly comply to that all the gas

4097.73 --> 4105.23
particles all of it

4101.15 --> 4108.53
nature's law it's it's physics its first

4105.23 --> 4112.5199999999995
oh would you mind if I give you an

4108.53 --> 4114.62
analogy about that I'd like you to not

4112.52 --> 4117.080000000001
an analogy I'd like to respond to that

4114.62 --> 4120.37
like don't you think that's true do you

4117.08 --> 4123.23
think that for example you have a

4120.37 --> 4125.12
pressurized container and you have a

4123.23 --> 4127.429999999999
vacuum chamber right next to it and

4125.12 --> 4132.61
there's an opening and let's say you put

4127.43 --> 4135.2300000000005
in call our dusts in the gas pressure

4132.61 --> 4138.259999999999
now you're gonna film it with a super

4135.23 --> 4141.29
super advanced high-speed camera well if

4138.26 --> 4142.9400000000005
that containers gonna if the barrier in

4141.29 --> 4144.41
between is gonna open it's gonna rush in

4142.94 --> 4146.66
there that's what we know well right

4144.41 --> 4148.37
before you do that first you look at the

4146.66 --> 4150.7699999999995
container with the gas pressure yeah

4148.37 --> 4152.599999999999
it's gonna be randomly floating around

4150.77 --> 4154.610000000001
because it has found its equilibrium

4152.6 --> 4158.870000000001
this will happen let me finish

4154.61 --> 4162.429999999999
but soon as you open it up that

4158.87 --> 4166.36
randomness is gonna instantly stop and

4162.43 --> 4169.34
every part all the molecules are gonna

4166.36 --> 4172.5199999999995
uniformly move towards the lower

4169.34 --> 4175.1
pressure no random little movements

4172.52 --> 4177.860000000001
anywhere no it's gonna instantly in a

4175.1 --> 4181.97
perfectly symmetrical uniform pattern

4177.86 --> 4184.04
move until the gas pressure has found

4181.97 --> 4187.87
its equilibrium and once that's happened

4184.04 --> 4192.92
then things will start to randomly move

4187.87 --> 4194.8099999999995
that's how it works so I think I think

4192.92 --> 4197.39
that that fundamental level is work

4194.81 --> 4201.8
we're gonna disagree you know and that

4197.39 --> 4206.4800000000005
that probably that's just a young dude

4201.8 --> 4208.7300000000005
so you dumb themselves is it's a net

4206.48 --> 4209.78
movement now I understand like I'm gonna

4208.73 --> 4211.04
have to give you the knowledge otherwise

4209.78 --> 4212.929999999999
I'm not gonna be able to explain it but

4211.04 --> 4214.58
let's imagine let's imagine a pack

4212.93 --> 4215.87
football stadium and everybody's

4214.58 --> 4218.36
watching a match in the papal ball

4215.87 --> 4220.37
Stadium and the final whistle goes and

4218.36 --> 4222.41
everybody leaves now you know and I know

4220.37 --> 4224.0
the at the end of a football match

4222.41 --> 4226.55
everybody leaves the match

4224.0 --> 4228.17
everybody goes but those people are

4226.55 --> 4230.27
communicating with each other about

4228.17 --> 4232.07
which sester they're gonna walk down

4230.27 --> 4233.72
they're not communicating about whether

4232.07 --> 4235.3099999999995
they they realize they've left the

4233.72 --> 4236.72
wallet on the seat they turn around or

4235.31 --> 4240.47
back in the opposite direction but the

4236.72 --> 4242.93
whole skill but the individual nature of

4240.47 --> 4244.97
movement which those people is random

4242.93 --> 4249.02
they're not connecting now it's not true

4244.97 --> 4250.85
and that's absolutely untrue that's and

4249.02 --> 4253.070000000001
it's not even a good comparison to be

4250.85 --> 4254.84
fair really but it's absolutely not true

4253.07 --> 4257.33
because what does happen is that people

4254.84 --> 4259.64
will try to find the easiest shortest

4257.33 --> 4262.94
route and the design of the stadium is

4259.64 --> 4266.27
built specifically to accommodate for

4262.94 --> 4268.7
this and thus people on average will

4266.27 --> 4272.150000000001
find the fastest way route out so they

4268.7 --> 4274.01
will typically fall in line with the

4272.15 --> 4276.65
design of the building that has been

4274.01 --> 4279.02
designed to accommodate for that so

4276.65 --> 4280.879999999999
that's why they always go pretty much in

4279.02 --> 4282.59
the same direction there's nothing to do

4280.88 --> 4284.66
with gas pressure at all because gas

4282.59 --> 4288.26
doesn't really make any choices

4284.66 --> 4291.0199999999995
it just maneuvers as it can with

4288.26 --> 4293.99
whatever the forces are applied they

4291.02 --> 4295.700000000001
will make the decision not the easiest

4293.99 --> 4298.3099999999995
way out they will make those decisions

4295.7 --> 4301.28
using and intelligence they will use

4298.31 --> 4303.950000000001
their own intelligence to move but if we

4301.28 --> 4309.74
take you know we can't imply that gas

4303.95 --> 4312.83
particle has intelligence you say I mean

4309.74 --> 4315.74
I don't that was a why are you making

4312.83 --> 4318.909
this weird comparison doesn't disprove

4315.74 --> 4321.3099999999995
what I just explained about that gas

4318.909 --> 4323.0199999999995
when it's not found its equilibrium yet

4321.31 --> 4325.150000000001
within the container does not move

4323.02 --> 4327.370000000001
randomly I just gave you a very detailed

4325.15 --> 4331.21
explanation and now you're comparing it

4327.37 --> 4333.969
to the behavior of humans in groups it's

4331.21 --> 4339.1
a very odd comparison that it's not

4333.969 --> 4341.92
really I can't really see what's on your

4339.1 --> 4347.679
screen but if you ever heard of Brownian

4341.92 --> 4350.61
motion sorry I I can't see your screen

4347.679 --> 4353.82
cuz I'm stuck on my phone and but uh

4350.61 --> 4360.61
have you ever heard of Brownian motion

4353.82 --> 4362.799999999999
Brownian Brownian motion yeah if you can

4360.61 --> 4364.509999999999
if you can put that into YouTube yeah I

4362.8 --> 4365.35
know I'm just gonna look it up before

4364.51 --> 4372.42
I'm gonna do anything

4365.35 --> 4377.110000000001
no no Brownian motion alright yeah okay

4372.42 --> 4380.1900000000005
no no I was gonna read it you don't need

4377.11 --> 4380.19
to do anything okay

4392.37 --> 4395.3
huh

4395.479 --> 4402.31
okay

4397.3 --> 4404.4400000000005
right it's very interesting so this is

4402.31 --> 4406.72
pretty interesting concept it is about

4404.44 --> 4412.57
well the random motion that you

4406.72 --> 4421.09
described of things guess what it's in

4412.57 --> 4425.139999999999
the container yes yes yes everything I'm

4421.09 --> 4427.24
seeing here is in a container yeah all

4425.14 --> 4428.950000000001
the particles that are motioning with in

4427.24 --> 4431.11
this demonstration here this live

4428.95 --> 4434.71
demonstration is within a specific

4431.11 --> 4440.32
container a square so right thank you

4434.71 --> 4441.58
for confirming I haven't finished I

4440.32 --> 4446.53
always Boeing with I mean if you'd like

4441.58 --> 4448.84
me to oh sure yeah I'm just so just say

4446.53 --> 4450.82
with not is Brownian motions obviously

4448.84 --> 4452.68
well you can observe as you've seen that

4450.82 --> 4454.36
you can observe the behavior of gas

4452.68 --> 4456.37
particles you can observe the random

4454.36 --> 4458.469999999999
movement and it does prove that there's

4456.37 --> 4460.75
random movement going on now for you to

4458.47 --> 4464.77
observe under these circumstances where

4460.75 --> 4465.73
yeah there is a container indeed so let

4464.77 --> 4468.700000000001
me ask you just a slightly different

4465.73 --> 4470.29
question against under on the

4468.7 --> 4472.8099999999995
philosophical side if those particles

4470.29 --> 4475.06
are behaving randomly are they behaving

4472.81 --> 4476.830000000001
randomly because they somehow are

4475.06 --> 4477.43
consciously aware that they are in a

4476.83 --> 4478.87
container

4477.43 --> 4481.21
nope or whether in the middle of that

4478.87 --> 4483.01
container are they totally unaware that

4481.21 --> 4485.14
that containers there there's no

4483.01 --> 4488.59
relevance they are allowed to move

4485.14 --> 4490.93
randomly because the pressure the

4488.59 --> 4492.88
container is there and they have found

4490.93 --> 4497.14
an equilibrium allowing the random

4492.88 --> 4502.27
motion because there's no barriers there

4497.14 --> 4505.18
it will at first uniformly move in an

4502.27 --> 4507.01
expanding way to find its equilibrium

4505.18 --> 4509.26
within the container and there will be

4507.01 --> 4511.12
no random movement during this process

4509.26 --> 4515.35
until it's far has found its new

4511.12 --> 4517.96
equilibrium that's how it works right I

4515.35 --> 4519.64
mean I would I would obviously totally

4517.96 --> 4521.5
disagree that but that's that's for yeah

4519.64 --> 4523.42
but that's just a ridiculous hand wave

4521.5 --> 4525.82
dismissal if you would do that and would

4523.42 --> 4527.32
serve no purpose oh no man I'm gonna

4525.82 --> 4529.96
stay on subject I'm gonna stand a

4527.32 --> 4530.92
suggestion don't worry in in terms of in

4529.96 --> 4533.83
terms of you

4530.92 --> 4536.53
our gas particles in anyway tension and

4533.83 --> 4538.9
they they understand you know whether or

4536.53 --> 4540.639999999999
not they're in a container you know a

4538.9 --> 4542.23
gas particle is not tension it won't

4540.64 --> 4545.37
move the way it moves regardless of

4542.23 --> 4548.53
whether it's in a container or not what

4545.37 --> 4551.8
you know the pressure is the the impact

4548.53 --> 4553.66
of that particle on a surface so you

4551.8 --> 4555.67
only get pressure when they collide and

4553.66 --> 4558.13
change momentum with a surface when

4555.67 --> 4561.6990000000005
they're not colliding with anything then

4558.13 --> 4563.59
they're not creating that pressure they

4561.699 --> 4565.2699999999995
have to be colliding with the surface of

4563.59 --> 4566.8
the container so you look at the gas

4565.27 --> 4569.280000000001
particles like hovering above the ground

4566.8 --> 4573.31
now we know that on the ground is about

4569.28 --> 4576.19
14.7 PSI we know that but what that

4573.31 --> 4579.219
means is I have to put an object of a

4576.19 --> 4581.62
square inch there to experience that

4579.219 --> 4583.42
pressure of 14 points them if those

4581.62 --> 4585.19
particles aren't colliding off an object

4583.42 --> 4587.92
then they're not causing that pressure

4585.19 --> 4588.599999999999
and so what I get out I know that's not

4587.92 --> 4592.3
true

4588.6 --> 4594.219
but what could you tell me what what oh

4592.3 --> 4596.9800000000005
the pressure of the rest of the gas

4594.219 --> 4598.06
surrounding it that's why it's uniform

4596.98 --> 4600.759999999999
that's the whole point

4598.06 --> 4603.580000000001
gas pressure psi it presses against

4600.76 --> 4605.62
everything continually until there is an

4603.58 --> 4608.76
equilibrium within the container after

4605.62 --> 4612.13
that point random movement can happen a

4608.76 --> 4614.05
division a gradient could happen

4612.13 --> 4616.900000000001
depending on whatever forces or

4614.05 --> 4621.67
anomalies are present but so the first

4616.9 --> 4624.28
didn't friend the proceedings is that

4621.67 --> 4626.5
the gas pressure finds the equilibrium

4624.28 --> 4631.36
within the container why is this so hard

4626.5 --> 4634.32
- let's sing in you can see if I point

4631.36 --> 4639.429
in it continually why don't you just

4634.32 --> 4641.949
conform this is physics truth it is a

4639.429 --> 4644.86
physics law it's not a misinterpretation

4641.949 --> 4651.61
it's demonstra ball okay

4644.86 --> 4654.419
the example you gave complies Tommy -

4651.61 --> 4657.688999999999
Tommy its responder

4654.419 --> 4659.219
sure John okay so if we look at the

4657.689 --> 4660.689
example you're talking about wait what

4659.219 --> 4662.61
you said pressure is just the gas

4660.689 --> 4665.099
pushing on everything you know

4662.61 --> 4667.38
let me ask in all their actions I've got

4665.099 --> 4669.809
a balloon and I've got a gas inside this

4667.38 --> 4671.61
that's pushing on the inside of the

4669.809 --> 4673.8
balloon and creating the gas pressure on

4671.61 --> 4675.619
the glue the gatholian

4673.8 --> 4677.939
X group of these stuck to the inside

4675.619 --> 4679.018999999999
walls of the blue there's some gas in

4677.939 --> 4681.809
the middle of the room

4679.019 --> 4684.030000000001
what's that pushing on on the rest of

4681.809 --> 4688.499
the gas that is in an equilibrium within

4684.03 --> 4691.38
the container okay you could possibly

4688.499 --> 4693.239
Google particle theory or kinetic theory

4691.38 --> 4694.829
so we can see diagrammatic

4693.239 --> 4697.829
representations of different states of

4694.829 --> 4700.11
matter I hoping that you know what does

4697.829 --> 4701.728999999999
that got to do with anything well

4700.11 --> 4704.249
because what it shows is that gas

4701.729 --> 4709.05
particles not not like solids and

4704.249 --> 4711.119
liquids there are spaces in enormous

4709.05 --> 4713.429
spaces from pertinence knives for gas

4711.119 --> 4718.11
particles between the particles so

4713.429 --> 4722.579
because there is such is that relevant

4718.11 --> 4724.32
well it's it's relevant because if you

4722.579 --> 4725.728999999999
are going to suggest that what's

4724.32 --> 4727.739
happening is the gas in the middle of

4725.729 --> 4730.499000000001
that balloon pushing on something what

4727.739 --> 4731.848999999999
I'm saying is that they are so far away

4730.499 --> 4735.059
from the gas bottle

4731.849 --> 4736.979
matter that's not that doesn't matter

4735.059 --> 4739.169
that's like trying to say

4736.979 --> 4741.84
entropy doesn't exist because there's

4739.169 --> 4744.059
too much face no it's a fact gas

4741.84 --> 4748.32
particles those matter how much space is

4744.059 --> 4750.9890000000005
in between it will press on each other

4748.32 --> 4753.478999999999
no matter the space in between until it

4750.989 --> 4756.119
has found an equilibrium it doesn't

4753.479 --> 4759.09
matter how much space is in between the

4756.119 --> 4763.139
particles this fact the mom serve of

4759.09 --> 4766.619000000001
fact remains help me understand this

4763.139 --> 4768.209
thing if me and you were scaled down to

4766.619 --> 4769.949
size of gas but let's say mean you on a

4768.209 --> 4771.949
football field job on end and I haven't

4769.949 --> 4774.03
do that that that's kind of

4771.949 --> 4776.339999999999
representative of the space between the

4774.03 --> 4779.659
gas how would I push on you the one into

4776.34 --> 4784.909000000001
the football field but you're given

4779.659 --> 4787.5
how does that work well you can't

4784.909 --> 4789.719
because it's gonna move out of the way

4787.5 --> 4791.85
because the gas is in an equilibrium

4789.719 --> 4793.8
state within the container allowing

4791.85 --> 4796.59
random movement allowing deviation if

4793.8 --> 4798.900000000001
you push it against the air it's just

4796.59 --> 4801.6
gonna evade it's gonna move around your

4798.9 --> 4803.61
hand so right let me just refine the

4801.6 --> 4806.1900000000005
question a lot right so in this instance

4803.61 --> 4808.5599999999995
me and you are being me and you me and

4806.19 --> 4809.94
you are being the gas particles and your

4808.56 --> 4811.77
one end of the pitch snap so there is

4809.94 --> 4813.8099999999995
nowhere between us because we are there

4811.77 --> 4815.400000000001
all right and the the length of that

4813.81 --> 4817.860000000001
football field is the gap between the

4815.4 --> 4820.17
particles so it's me and you in a vacuum

4817.86 --> 4822.9
or with well we are being the gas

4820.17 --> 4824.4
particles how do I is that gas particle

4822.9 --> 4828.089999999999
at one end of the football field how do

4824.4 --> 4831.21
I push on you at the other end it's

4828.09 --> 4834.03
already happening it is constantly

4831.21 --> 4836.07
happening it is a state of gas it

4834.03 --> 4837.869
presses on each other no matter the

4836.07 --> 4840.719
distance that's the part of the

4837.869 --> 4844.98
equilibrium that's the part of entropy

4840.719 --> 4847.56
it does the distance is not relevant you

4844.98 --> 4850.0199999999995
can't compare if a physical push of a

4847.56 --> 4853.320000000001
solid object against another solid

4850.02 --> 4856.619000000001
object of the nature of entropy of gas

4853.32 --> 4858.9
gas pressure particles it's not the same

4856.619 --> 4861.389
thing well that's that's what I need to

4858.9 --> 4864.96
help you understand beep it I'll be

4861.389 --> 4866.88
ready tonight how can i I don't know why

4864.96 --> 4870.35
I just know that it does that because

4866.88 --> 4872.639
you can demonstrate that it does that

4870.35 --> 4874.889
that's okay so you don't mean if you

4872.639 --> 4877.59
don't know why you don't know why I just

4874.889 --> 4880.05
know it works that way it is a law of

4877.59 --> 4882.409000000001
nature it is love physics what's the

4880.05 --> 4884.55
problem here

4882.409 --> 4886.049999999999
look if you I'm not gonna push you on

4884.55 --> 4887.88
something you don't know if you if you

4886.05 --> 4890.34
say you don't know don't tell me I don't

4887.88 --> 4893.119
know okay I don't I might not know the

4890.34 --> 4895.5
cause I just know it's there and it's

4893.119 --> 4900.119
demonstratable and it is a law of

4895.5 --> 4903.48
physics all these things say yes this is

4900.119 --> 4906.69
what's there this is how it works you

4903.48 --> 4909.69
can draw all these analogies with other

4906.69 --> 4911.339999999999
scale things with physical solid matter

4909.69 --> 4915.54
and

4911.34 --> 4918.78
not relevant the the thing is entropy is

4915.54 --> 4920.46
there you can demonstrate how it works

4918.78 --> 4924.33
why does it work that way

4920.46 --> 4926.25
who gives a rat's ass it works that way

4924.33 --> 4929.369
and you can demonstrate it you can

4926.25 --> 4932.46
predict it you can model it and it

4929.369 --> 4934.38
always works if you want to switch to

4932.46 --> 4936.659
entropy I mean like because obviously

4934.38 --> 4938.639
we're not but this is the point where

4936.659 --> 4940.32
we're totally disagree my point is going

4938.639 --> 4942.63
to be the two gas particles because

4940.32 --> 4944.4
they're extremely far apart are not

4942.63 --> 4945.96
pushing on each other and the pressure

4944.4 --> 4948.388999999999
only occurs when the Clyde within inside

4945.96 --> 4950.159
containing your stance is that somehow

4948.389 --> 4951.659000000001
there is a push between the two but

4950.159 --> 4954.33
you're not in a position to explain it

4951.659 --> 4958.23
so that's the bit where we know I can't

4954.33 --> 4960.389
explain exactly that I can't explain the

4958.23 --> 4962.82
cause of entropy but I can explain

4960.389 --> 4964.86
exactly that and I did so your false

4962.82 --> 4966.33
suggestions then I didn't just proves

4964.86 --> 4968.489
that you haven't been paying attention

4966.33 --> 4973.44
to what I said what I said is the

4968.489 --> 4977.4
particles will all uniformly uniformly

4973.44 --> 4981.0599999999995
equally in all directions push on each

4977.4 --> 4983.61
other no matter the distance per

4981.06 --> 4984.9800000000005
particle it's not relevant they will

4983.61 --> 4989.848999999999
push on each other

4984.98 --> 4992.159
until that specific uniform pressure

4989.849 --> 4994.349
which is entropy has found an

4992.159 --> 4997.379999999999
equilibrium within the container and

4994.349 --> 4999.150000000001
then that pressure will be in balance it

4997.38 --> 5001.46
will not be physically measurable

4999.15 --> 5003.5
because it's in balance it's found its

5001.46 --> 5006.83
equilibrium it's only when the

5003.5 --> 5010.13
equilibrium is disrupted by expanding

5006.83 --> 5015.199
the container that the force will appear

5010.13 --> 5019.31
again that's entropy it's not about

5015.199 --> 5022.848999999999
local equilibrium found containers with

5019.31 --> 5025.369000000001
gas that I can motion and whatever twirl

5022.849 --> 5028.909000000001
around do random things no entropy is a

5025.369 --> 5033.23
separate effect from local air pressure

5028.909 --> 5034.848999999999
caused by local forces so here I mean

5033.23 --> 5037.5199999999995
what you're saying I mean obviously we

5034.849 --> 5039.08
you know what we're not gonna agree the

5037.52 --> 5040.76
tumbling box if you're not gonna agree

5039.08 --> 5044.1
about this then there's no more place

5040.76 --> 5046.38
for you because I've been spending over

5044.1 --> 5049.38
half-an-hour detailing this out in

5046.38 --> 5051.81
detail and you're supposedly a teacher

5049.38 --> 5056.25
right well if I don't get it at this

5051.81 --> 5058.26
point you need to be fired I mean I'm

5056.25 --> 5061.56
serious you need to be fired if you

5058.26 --> 5063.84
don't get this this stuff is second

5061.56 --> 5067.860000000001
grade school okay

5063.84 --> 5071.400000000001
please but I learned this when I was 13

5067.86 --> 5075.889999999999
right in physics class as the law of

5071.4 --> 5078.32
nature entropy this how it works

5075.89 --> 5080.7300000000005
would you like but you should know this

5078.32 --> 5081.84
would I don't know how would you like

5080.73 --> 5083.4
because I never know whether you want me

5081.84 --> 5085.14
to respond up because I don't speak okay

5083.4 --> 5091.98
would you like me to respond now jump

5085.14 --> 5094.200000000001
its way sure so I mean yeah I am a

5091.98 --> 5099.089999999999
physics teacher and I have done this all

5094.2 --> 5100.74
my life you know this is my job and when

5099.09 --> 5103.32
it comes to sort of understanding the

5100.74 --> 5105.42
basic model

5103.32 --> 5107.009999999999
you know those gap art schools when they

5105.42 --> 5108.54
have a huge distance between them like

5107.01 --> 5110.76
me and you when we put ourselves on that

5108.54 --> 5113.04
football pit there is no way from one

5110.76 --> 5115.8
side of the pitch I could push you when

5113.04 --> 5118.26
you're on the other side yeah same to

5115.8 --> 5121.8
you why unless we were talking about

5118.26 --> 5125.01
some sort of non-contact do you remember

5121.8 --> 5127.35
do you remember me explaining to you why

5125.01 --> 5131.400000000001
would you like to give me a feedback as

5127.35 --> 5132.96
to why yeah I remember when I asked you

5131.4 --> 5136.08
how do they push you said you don't know

5132.96 --> 5140.01
of course you just know that they do no

5136.08 --> 5142.59
no no no no no that's the next subject

5140.01 --> 5145.530000000001
don't try to mix things up talking about

5142.59 --> 5148.860000000001
your example of pushing in the air and

5145.53 --> 5152.099999999999
then expecting somebody far away to be

5148.86 --> 5156.2699999999995
affected by that why would it not why

5152.1 --> 5159.150000000001
would it not be now that you know but I

5156.27 --> 5163.14
would know no more deviations I you're

5159.15 --> 5165.12
gonna respond to this now why not again

5163.14 --> 5168.39
again look I'm losing my patience here

5165.12 --> 5169.98
again why if you're standing on one side

5168.39 --> 5171.240000000001
of the football field and somebody else

5169.98 --> 5173.94
is standing on the other side of the

5171.24 --> 5176.639999999999
football field why if somebody pushes

5173.94 --> 5177.339999999999
against the air would they not affect

5176.64 --> 5179.110000000001
the

5177.34 --> 5182.56
other one on the other side of the field

5179.11 --> 5184.36
what was my explanation that wasn't the

5182.56 --> 5188.31
another di you you know but I want you

5184.36 --> 5192.429
to it respond to this right now

5188.31 --> 5194.080000000001
Owen what you say it's fun yeah would

5192.429 --> 5195.6990000000005
you like me to respond now joints wait I

5194.08 --> 5199.0199999999995
want you to answer the question that I

5195.699 --> 5202.8099999999995
just asked you let me know when I can

5199.02 --> 5206.1990000000005
right now yeah but don't the question no

5202.81 --> 5208.780000000001
internal writes nothing else why not why

5206.199 --> 5212.53
can't you do that ok so right now I can

5208.78 --> 5212.92
respond now yes ok so when I put that to

5212.53 --> 5215.05
you

5212.92 --> 5216.639
you you mission trip to the question

5215.05 --> 5219.01
that I was talking about to people with

5216.639 --> 5220.119
it we okay now yeah when you put you on

5219.01 --> 5228.88
the earth the earth moves out the way

5220.119 --> 5231.009999999999
yeah I'm done with you I told you to

5228.88 --> 5233.619
answer the question and you're going

5231.01 --> 5236.17
into meta talk I'm done with this it's

5233.619 --> 5241.75
been mildly interesting but it's done

5236.17 --> 5244.929
and yeah you've had your chance in my

5241.75 --> 5249.34
humble opinion you should absolutely be

5244.929 --> 5252.2390000000005
fired as a physics teacher and I

5249.34 --> 5256.179
wouldn't give you anything more than

5252.239 --> 5258.82
grade school really because if you don't

5256.179 --> 5262.179
get this fundamental principle that is

5258.82 --> 5265.09
part of physics law then you have no

5262.179 --> 5268.54
place in a school or a university or

5265.09 --> 5270.34
wherever as a physics teacher unless

5268.54 --> 5272.38
you're just gonna hand out people books

5270.34 --> 5273.79
and working by the book and leaving it

5272.38 --> 5277.06
to that because your actual

5273.79 --> 5280.719
understanding of physics is poor at best

5277.06 --> 5287.04
I would give you a five at this point

5280.719 --> 5291.33
for your knowledge okay sorry but

5287.04 --> 5293.91
yeah it's just I only have so much

5291.33 --> 5297.03
tolerance and now where has been enough

5293.91 --> 5299.03
thank you very much so yeah I'm gonna

5297.03 --> 5304.55
round out the show it's been interesting

5299.03 --> 5309.54
I do want to give some kudos to

5304.55 --> 5311.13
conspiracy cats for at least trying up

5309.54 --> 5312.99
to a certain degree and we had some

5311.13 --> 5315.87
interesting conversations I think that

5312.99 --> 5320.099999999999
as a person with his inner feelings he

5315.87 --> 5322.26
seems to be kind of okay but seriously

5320.1 --> 5324.18
if you are really a physics teacher with

5322.26 --> 5328.46
this level of knowledge that's just an

5324.18 --> 5331.34
embarrassment it really is really sorry

5328.46 --> 5334.85
nothing personal but this is just bad

5331.34 --> 5342.51
this is bad this is a red flag this is

5334.85 --> 5344.490000000001
yeah anyway thank you every one for

5342.51 --> 5348.06
coming to the show and bearing with me

5344.49 --> 5349.83
throughout this sorry for other people

5348.06 --> 5353.370000000001
that I did not let you out I know you

5349.83 --> 5355.29
probably wanted a shot at this guy and I

5353.37 --> 5360.66
hope you are satisfied with these shots

5355.29 --> 5362.5199999999995
that I did take I don't think I'm

5360.66 --> 5366.36
probably gonna do anything like this

5362.52 --> 5368.040000000001
anytime soon although I might again at

5366.36 --> 5372.0599999999995
some point I'd love to have just regular

5368.04 --> 5375.54
panels again also Riley I hope you're

5372.06 --> 5379.47
gonna be a bit cooling down about this

5375.54 --> 5381.68
and not be a child and just get over air

5379.47 --> 5383.610000000001
I'd love to hear your opinion about this

5381.68 --> 5386.04
situation about what customary

5383.61 --> 5388.589999999999
conspiracy cat's here did love to hear

5386.04 --> 5390.96
your opinion on it tomorrow if you'll be

5388.59 --> 5394.56

5390.96 --> 5396.44
let's not let things are out of hand we

5394.56 --> 5398.43
don't need any more in fighting okay

5396.44 --> 5402.21
just
