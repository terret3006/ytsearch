foreign

63.26 --> 68.0
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

66.54 --> 71.28
bird number

68.0 --> 72.9
1073 I'm your host Arwin and before we

71.28 --> 75.24
start the show please don't forget to

72.9 --> 77.7
share it on any platform you deem fit

75.24 --> 79.32
and if you haven't already subscribe to

77.7 --> 82.259
my channel and hit the Bell notification

79.32 --> 84.24
so you know when I'm going live which is

82.259 --> 86.4
normally 1pm Amsterdam time of the

84.24 --> 89.03999999999999
weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam time in the

86.4 --> 91.619
weekend and please also do support me

89.04 --> 93.18
through the PayPal patreon crypto wallet

91.619 --> 95.34
Super Chat and the membership system

93.18 --> 96.96000000000001
join button that would be much

95.34 --> 99.119
appreciated

96.96 --> 101.82
so

99.119 --> 104.579
whether today is

101.82 --> 106.75899999999999
something entirely different look at

104.579 --> 106.759
this

108.6 --> 114.24
talk about a contrast with yesterday

111.96 --> 116.33999999999999
it's

114.24 --> 120.439
Clear Blue Skies

116.34 --> 120.43900000000001
really clear really clear

122.1 --> 128.459
and clouds

125.1 --> 131.57999999999998
yeah no gray soup

128.459 --> 134.099
just a bunch of clouds and a lot of

131.58 --> 138.14000000000001
beautiful blue sky in between and the

134.099 --> 138.14
sun coming through brightly

141.959 --> 147.739
yeah that tree over there has completely

144.239 --> 147.739
lost every single leaf now

149.16 --> 155.76
also starting to notice the other tree

152.459 --> 156.959
which was staying green for a very long

155.76 --> 159.66
time

156.959 --> 162.66
when the other one is already coloring

159.66 --> 165.379
it's now also kind of turning

162.66 --> 165.379
yellow

169.98 --> 175.16
and those trees over there lost all

171.9 --> 175.16
their leaves now completely

175.26 --> 179.94
yeah

177.44 --> 183.35999999999999
such a beautiful day

179.94 --> 183.35999999999999
it's almost hypnotizing

191.879 --> 196.2
don't know what the temperature is but I

194.099 --> 198.659
think it's probably warmer than it was

196.2 --> 203.22
yesterday oh

198.659 --> 204.89999999999998
that Jets already filled up

203.22 --> 207.42
yeah sorry for starting a little late

204.9 --> 210.18
half hour late I

207.42 --> 212.48
was really comfortable in my bed this

210.18 --> 212.48000000000002
morning

214.14 --> 220.14
took some extra time

217.379 --> 222.239
anyway Al's G

220.14 --> 226.44
first in chat

222.239 --> 229.62
logical observations or capital letters

226.44 --> 232.14
hello Gadget inspector slo-mo moon buggy

229.62 --> 234.799
Daniel Robles

232.14 --> 234.79899999999998
Cleary

235.439 --> 238.7
yeah good to see you guys

239.939 --> 248.34
it is Wednesday the 17th of November

245.34 --> 248.34
2021.

250.5 --> 255.48
all right and I already got a title but

253.26 --> 258.299
yeah that's

255.48 --> 260.88
it's kind of universal it's not a

258.299 --> 262.5
specific theme I just came up with that

260.88 --> 264.18
yesterday and just thought oh I'm just

262.5 --> 267.38
gonna fill that in

264.18 --> 267.38
for tomorrow's show

271.259 --> 279.8
all right just an amazing night rest I

276.3 --> 279.8
feel like so much better

281.22 --> 284.94000000000005
no more tension

283.38 --> 288.12
like

284.94 --> 291.02
in here and no more tension down there

288.12 --> 291.02
feel great

291.9 --> 298.08
I also took that shower

295.139 --> 300.86
that's why I got my hair a little

298.08 --> 300.85999999999996
fluffy

304.56 --> 309.24
did you hear that the Russians tried to

307.02 --> 312.25899999999996
blow up the ISS what

309.24 --> 312.259
are you talking about

316.139 --> 319.16
hello clutch

319.86 --> 325.28000000000003
it's called in the shed this morning

322.8 --> 325.28000000000003
all right

328.02 --> 332.35999999999996
yeah let me check the temperature here

337.08 --> 342.71999999999997
12. it's 12 degrees okay so it went up a

341.16 --> 345.18
little

342.72 --> 348.32000000000005
it feels warmer though but that might

345.18 --> 348.32
just be because of the Sun

351.419 --> 354.65999999999997
or my blood flow is just doing really

353.699 --> 357.12
great

354.66 --> 359.34000000000003
maybe because of the shower

357.12 --> 361.039
like I felt a whole lot better afterward

359.34 --> 364.46
it's it's weird

361.039 --> 364.46
Works differently

368.16 --> 370.819
hmm

387.539 --> 393.979
first Frost

389.639 --> 393.979
on the Yale University campus okay

394.8 --> 399.56
wait you're on the Yale University

396.72 --> 399.56
campus

401.46 --> 404.539
what are you doing there

404.94 --> 408.319
are you a teacher or something

411.66 --> 417.36
oh right the Russians blew up the debris

414.84 --> 419.9
yeah I yeah I noticed that those

417.36 --> 419.90000000000003
articles

423.84 --> 428.69899999999996
yeah and about like oh the ISS has to be

426.66 --> 432.66
hide

428.699 --> 435.18
because of debris yeah that but that

432.66 --> 437.28000000000003
warning came up like

435.18 --> 438.18
a week ago or something I shared it back

437.28 --> 441.65999999999997
then

438.18 --> 444.68
when I bumped into that here in the show

441.66 --> 444.68
hello xgen

449.22 --> 454.46000000000004
yeah but nothing's really happening

451.259 --> 454.46000000000004
though right

466.979 --> 472.94
I mean I'm not getting messages like oh

469.379 --> 472.94
it blew up no

476.46 --> 478.63899999999995
foreign

489.02 --> 495.02
janitor solves equations

492.3 --> 495.02000000000004
what

496.86 --> 504.72
I'm it's down my street oh okay

501.419 --> 508.039
you're you're living uh practically next

504.72 --> 508.03900000000004
to it okay that explains

517.32 --> 522.0600000000001
well look did they even give out some

520.14 --> 523.38
kind of mechanical details about all

522.06 --> 525.06
that right because when they said oh

523.38 --> 526.98
they're going to blow up a satellite and

525.06 --> 529.14
oh blah blah blah they don't even

526.98 --> 532.62
mention like what type of satellite is

529.14 --> 535.74
like how high it is is it same height as

532.62 --> 538.26
the ISS or is it lower usually

535.74 --> 540.779
I thought that

538.26 --> 544.4399999999999
most satellites were designated to be

540.779 --> 547.88
much lower than where the ISS is

544.44 --> 547.8800000000001
if I remember correctly

550.08 --> 556.32
so

552.18 --> 559.9799999999999
right if the ISS has to correct

556.32 --> 562.38
its orbits like giving a little push to

559.98 --> 565.26
keep it at the same height then I think

562.38 --> 567.8389999999999
that any debris from a satellites

565.26 --> 569.76
theoretically in the conceptual medium

567.839 --> 571.2
of outer space with where that's all

569.76 --> 573.66
possible

571.2 --> 575.76
all that debris should just like maybe

573.66 --> 577.5
at first when it blows up scatter a

575.76 --> 580.279
little but then it just should be

577.5 --> 580.279
falling down

583.8 --> 587.76
I don't know

585.72 --> 591.12
they didn't give real they really didn't

587.76 --> 596.24
really give any mechanical data

591.12 --> 596.24
during those article reports so

597.0 --> 599.72
uh

603.72 --> 609.0600000000001
getting ready to retire the ISS yeah

606.6 --> 611.899
well that is some yes

609.06 --> 611.899
I eat

615.54 --> 621.54
that could be a possibility maybe it

618.72 --> 623.94
just doesn't work anymore the way it

621.54 --> 627.42
used to

623.94 --> 632.8800000000001
because I guess that social engineering

627.42 --> 634.8
and agent manipulation is now much more

632.88 --> 637.5
active

634.8 --> 641.3
so and since they are kind of like that

637.5 --> 641.3
conjoined thing

641.399 --> 646.68
that was playing

643.62 --> 648.0
on the second level even during the Cold

646.68 --> 650.16
War

648.0 --> 652.32
that maybe now that's just like it's

650.16 --> 654.8389999999999
becoming too risky or something or they

652.32 --> 657.24
just went out they want that to end and

654.839 --> 659.6400000000001
want to do their own separate thing so

657.24 --> 661.019
they can't get meddled with

659.64 --> 664.88
I mean

661.019 --> 664.88
not gonna blame the Russians for that

666.72 --> 670.86
they should they seem to be doing just

669.06 --> 673.5
fine on their own

670.86 --> 675.3000000000001
overall I find the projects that they

673.5 --> 678.42
roll out

675.3 --> 680.579
at least have a facsimile of

678.42 --> 683.4799999999999
convincingness

680.579 --> 683.4799999999999
if that's a word

688.86 --> 692.04
but yeah that's been going for a while

691.56 --> 693.66
like

692.04 --> 696.42
[Music]

693.66 --> 698.279
messages have been rolling out about

696.42 --> 700.9799999999999
that for a while like the Russians want

698.279 --> 703.9399999999999
to do something separate are they really

700.98 --> 703.94
gonna blow it up

704.7 --> 709.44
like make the whole thing end in some

707.399 --> 713.66
kind of accident or something

709.44 --> 713.6600000000001
or yeah worse I don't know

718.26 --> 722.22
I think that would make things very

720.0 --> 724.92
complicated

722.22 --> 727.88
because then it it'll just draw more

724.92 --> 727.88
attention to it

730.74 --> 733.279
anyway

735.959 --> 743.54
moon landings pushed back to 2025 okay

740.639 --> 743.54
right

761.76 --> 769.68
we'll do something that is visible

766.079 --> 769.68
well maybe

776.579 --> 780.54
I don't know it all depends

779.279 --> 783.54
right

780.54 --> 787.68
I mean maybe they could get as silly as

783.54 --> 790.5
like oh no a fire broke out or something

787.68 --> 792.779
and that you could kind of see

790.5 --> 795.48
it burned from the ground I don't know

792.779 --> 797.22
this sounds really weird

795.48 --> 800.88
I don't know what they've got planned to

797.22 --> 803.839
be honest not exactly

800.88 --> 806.88
but yeah the uh the story has been

803.839 --> 809.7790000000001
moving towards like the ISS being

806.88 --> 809.779
disbanded

811.139 --> 816.36
but that's been running for a while so

813.36 --> 818.48
it could still go on very long I don't

816.36 --> 818.48
know

820.26 --> 825.3
I mean there's never really any true

822.779 --> 828.32
mechanical urgency it's just yeah

825.3 --> 828.3199999999999
narrative change

828.959 --> 831.68
uh

838.92 --> 844.68
burn in it

841.56 --> 848.279
burn it in the atmosphere you mean

844.68 --> 849.3
make it burn up in the atmosphere as it

848.279 --> 850.8
goes down

849.3 --> 854.06
supposedly

850.8 --> 854.06
Gadget inspector

865.38 --> 871.8
a palette of burning toilet paper

869.339 --> 874.639
huh

871.8 --> 874.639
okay

899.279 --> 903.24
yeah maybe they're gonna just like make

902.1 --> 905.339
a prop

903.24 --> 907.44
of the ISS

905.339 --> 912.0790000000001
like a balloon prop fill it with

907.44 --> 912.0790000000001
hydrogen and then blow that off

912.779 --> 916.459
who knows I don't know man

917.16 --> 922.26
do it could just turn out just as well

919.92 --> 924.24
they they're just gonna quietly take it

922.26 --> 925.92
down and then nobody hears from it again

924.24 --> 929.42
and they just say you're like yeah yeah

925.92 --> 929.42
I was disassembled and

931.079 --> 936.079
and it's like all dropped down in the

933.36 --> 936.0790000000001
ocean or something

936.959 --> 942.92
and that you never get to see anything

938.82 --> 942.9200000000001
you you never really know for sure

948.6 --> 954.259
a Moon Shadow

951.54 --> 954.259
it's been a while

954.3 --> 959.639
is it

956.22 --> 963.8000000000001
I thought I saw you like a week ago

959.639 --> 963.8
anyway yeah welcome back to chat

991.259 --> 993.44
foreign

1002.68 --> 1008.9799999999999
by the way I finally took a look at that

1006.019 --> 1008.98
flat fellows Channel

1010.639 --> 1016.16
I don't see him here in chat right now

1012.68 --> 1018.699
but I did take a look and left a comment

1016.16 --> 1018.699
uh

1030.02 --> 1035.059
I've had some trouble with your keyboard

1032.419 --> 1038.98
there LG

1035.059 --> 1038.98
probably meant scene not been

1056.179 --> 1061.76
YouTube doesn't have the Flat Earth is

1058.58 --> 1065.86
an archaic concept on flat what

1061.76 --> 1065.86
I've never seen that clearly

1066.38 --> 1070.88
you mean are you saying that they had

1068.419 --> 1074.5
like banners I've never seen that or is

1070.88 --> 1074.5
that like a mobile only thing

1076.7 --> 1081.28
hello Stone monkey Professor Phil

1094.52 --> 1101.559
Toad the space car to Mars okay

1098.0 --> 1101.559
catch it inspector

1107.179 --> 1112.1000000000001
it's it was a Wikipedia oh oh well

1110.12 --> 1116.1999999999998
that's not really YouTube then is it

1112.1 --> 1116.1999999999998
clearly that's Wikipedia

1138.08 --> 1142.1599999999999
oh your phone is a cracked screen oh

1140.299 --> 1144.82
yeah okay that that can bring

1142.16 --> 1144.8200000000002
complications

1144.86 --> 1148.0
I'll see you all right

1168.74 --> 1174.74
what's the maximum actual height above

1171.86 --> 1178.12
Earth mankind has really achieved you

1174.74 --> 1178.1200000000001
mean officially achieved

1183.32 --> 1186.34
I don't know

1190.4 --> 1193.9
I have no idea really

1204.26 --> 1209.6
no really not officially

1206.539 --> 1212.5
really I don't know

1209.6 --> 1212.5
I don't know

1213.38 --> 1218.419
like it yeah if you're gonna include

1215.48 --> 1221.78
like where did they go

1218.419 --> 1224.659
like when they really tested it

1221.78 --> 1225.86
completely out of out of any reach of

1224.659 --> 1227.9
any media

1225.86 --> 1230.539
because they probably have done such

1227.9 --> 1233.3200000000002
tests I don't know man I don't know how

1230.539 --> 1233.32
high they went up

1256.64 --> 1262.4
let the helium out of the balloons

1259.7 --> 1264.799
well when you go really high up Jeff

1262.4 --> 1266.96
gashead yeah because it will kind of

1264.799 --> 1268.52
start to expand

1266.96 --> 1271.28
and then if you don't want the balloon

1268.52 --> 1274.36
to rip it's good to be able to release

1271.28 --> 1274.36
some of that helium

1277.82 --> 1281.62
to keep it going a little longer

1307.6 --> 1314.559
well congratulations Professor Phil

1310.34 --> 1314.559
you're an expert in orbital mechanics

1316.82 --> 1321.2
I mean you're such an expert right so

1319.28 --> 1324.799
does that mean that you could

1321.2 --> 1326.3600000000001
technically recreate the Lost Telemetry

1324.799 --> 1329.179
data

1326.36 --> 1331.4599999999998
from the Apollo mission

1329.179 --> 1333.98
that's so painful for them to put it

1331.46 --> 1337.039
back together could you reconstruct it

1333.98 --> 1340.9
could you back engineer it

1337.039 --> 1340.9
since you're such an expert at it

1344.0 --> 1349.64
I mean if you're a real expert

1346.7 --> 1351.74
like you're a master of all that then it

1349.64 --> 1352.76
should not be too hard for you to

1351.74 --> 1355.82
actually

1352.76 --> 1358.96
try to back engineer reconstruct their

1355.82 --> 1358.96
Telemetry data

1370.52 --> 1373.84
oh it's now Birds

1393.02 --> 1398.6
hey Mike zidunich

1395.6 --> 1398.6
foreign

1465.26 --> 1468.279
anyway yeah

1468.86 --> 1473.7199999999998
just thinking about

1470.779 --> 1476.419
virtual things

1473.72 --> 1478.22
because it's tough it's tough to abandon

1476.419 --> 1480.6200000000001
that

1478.22 --> 1482.6000000000001
because like before I figured out Flat

1480.62 --> 1485.86
Earth I was constantly thinking about

1482.6 --> 1485.86
like how do we

1485.9 --> 1491.6200000000001
how do we get up there like could we

1488.6 --> 1491.62
like use a

1493.64 --> 1500.96
other launching systems right

1496.64 --> 1503.0
for example the uh the Brandon's flight

1500.96 --> 1505.22
what is it again the Virgin Galactic

1503.0 --> 1507.559
like I always thought that was a really

1505.22 --> 1510.559
interesting conceptual idea like okay

1507.559 --> 1513.039
you just lightened the load by already

1510.559 --> 1517.779
taking it up there and then the last

1513.039 --> 1517.779
part you rock it through

1518.0 --> 1522.62
but yeah it was I guess never really

1519.98 --> 1523.88
designed to be in orbit or anything

1522.62 --> 1526.4599999999998
but

1523.88 --> 1527.2990000000002
I've even thought like oh what if you

1526.46 --> 1530.419
just

1527.299 --> 1534.4
use like a magnetic rail launching

1530.419 --> 1534.4
system you like build a big tunnel

1534.919 --> 1542.539
and you have a ship in there with some

1538.1 --> 1542.539
extra rocket but you like magnetically

1542.659 --> 1547.279
like start slowly so nobody has to be

1545.24 --> 1550.1
crushed in some kind of G-Force and then

1547.279 --> 1553.039
yeah it accelerates and then

1550.1 --> 1555.799
goes much faster

1553.039 --> 1560.08
so that it can yeah just be launched

1555.799 --> 1560.08
like a big bullet and then the rocket

1560.6 --> 1566.559
also helps it push it further up there

1567.5 --> 1571.299
God yes it is

1572.72 --> 1576.919
it's terrible yeah but it's all

1575.299 --> 1579.32
completely useless because you can't

1576.919 --> 1581.0
really get in Orbit because it doesn't

1579.32 --> 1582.62
exist

1581.0 --> 1587.38
so anything you're going to shoot up

1582.62 --> 1587.3799999999999
there is gonna come down again like

1588.26 --> 1592.12
yeah and if you if you're too good

1594.14 --> 1598.5800000000002
then you might actually like make it

1596.24 --> 1600.5
bump into something solid

1598.58 --> 1601.82
up there

1600.5 --> 1604.84
but I don't know if that's even

1601.82 --> 1604.84
physically possible

1605.539 --> 1609.58
like if that can be achieved

1616.46 --> 1621.88
bin launch what

1619.46 --> 1621.88
what

1628.7 --> 1634.0
spin launcher no I've never heard of

1630.74 --> 1634.0
that Stevie Traveler

1634.039 --> 1637.84
okay so I'll have to Google it

1661.64 --> 1664.6000000000001
what

1680.419 --> 1684.679
huh

1682.34 --> 1687.6999999999998
okay

1684.679 --> 1687.7
that is

1687.88 --> 1691.24
really weird

1691.279 --> 1697.039
like really weird but yeah that's kind

1695.24 --> 1698.96
of like the gist of what I just

1697.039 --> 1701.24
described

1698.96 --> 1704.08
that this seems really small scale

1701.24 --> 1704.08
though like what

1720.02 --> 1725.899
but sure looks like one hell of a ride

1723.98 --> 1727.76
as in like a

1725.899 --> 1730.299
a carnival ride

1727.76 --> 1730.299
but

1731.779 --> 1738.559
yeah I wasn't prepared to see something

1735.26 --> 1740.6589999999999
like that that's just weird

1738.559 --> 1742.96
can't yeah can't wait to see it in

1740.659 --> 1742.96
action

1759.679 --> 1763.179
what's that steamy Traveler

1766.46 --> 1769.059
huh

1769.52 --> 1774.1
hey what if

1771.5 --> 1774.1
video

1790.1 --> 1796.0
dude but

1791.48 --> 1796.0
that's not a manned vehicle is it

1802.1 --> 1804.399
foreign

1808.52 --> 1813.559
because like all that hyper spinning

1811.34 --> 1816.1589999999999
especially in the small that looks kind

1813.559 --> 1816.1589999999999
of hazardous

1816.799 --> 1822.399
is this just yeah this looks more like a

1819.14 --> 1822.3990000000001
new satellite thing

1823.7 --> 1829.659
I wouldn't want to put a a person in

1826.22 --> 1829.659
such a launching system

1834.98 --> 1841.3600000000001
okay and that video it just looks

1838.039 --> 1841.36
straight out like a missile

1851.899 --> 1857.559
so they basically launch a pod it opens

1854.84 --> 1857.559
up and then

1858.32 --> 1861.399
the weird man

1879.98 --> 1882.1
thank you

1885.44 --> 1889.419
yeah in mandolin no [ __ ]

1893.6 --> 1898.399
I don't know man this look that's

1896.059 --> 1902.2
supposed to be like oh SP looks more

1898.399 --> 1902.1999999999998
like basically a weapon system

1913.46 --> 1919.94
to a thousand G's once yeah that's

1916.46 --> 1922.22
definitely not manned holy [ __ ] thousand

1919.94 --> 1924.14
G's that's insane

1922.22 --> 1927.019
there's got to be some strong materials

1924.14 --> 1930.019
in in there too [ __ ]

1927.019 --> 1930.019
foreign

1930.14 --> 1935.0590000000002
well my idea wasn't really that

1933.32 --> 1937.76
because it looks more like a weapon

1935.059 --> 1942.98
system prototype to me

1937.76 --> 1945.5
my idea was rather just a very long rail

1942.98 --> 1947.3600000000001
it was based on a what I think is a

1945.5 --> 1949.88
rumor because I don't have never seen

1947.36 --> 1952.1589999999999
any confirmation that that was real it

1949.88 --> 1955.3400000000001
was a like a rumor back in the day in

1952.159 --> 1956.7990000000002
the 90s that Saddam Hussein had like a

1955.34 --> 1958.82
magnetic

1956.799 --> 1962.84
launching system where you basically

1958.82 --> 1965.4189999999999
could shoot and rocketed nukes or

1962.84 --> 1967.34
whatever to other countries

1965.419 --> 1969.44
and like

1967.34 --> 1971.899
yeah that way

1969.44 --> 1974.299
if you just go in a straight line then

1971.899 --> 1976.76
any uh person in there is not going to

1974.299 --> 1979.24
be crushed by the center centripetal

1976.76 --> 1979.24
forces

1979.34 --> 1984.1999999999998
and yeah it's just like you start slow

1981.799 --> 1987.08
then you go faster faster faster at a

1984.2 --> 1989.48
very specific rate the the length of the

1987.08 --> 1990.9189999999999
launch the magnetic launch rail has to

1989.48 --> 1994.039
be long enough

1990.919 --> 1996.5590000000002
and then at the end of it yeah it shoots

1994.039 --> 1999.74
off at incredible pace and then anybody

1996.559 --> 2000.94
in there will not have been crushed at

1999.74 --> 2003.7
all

2000.94 --> 2005.14
right then you could use a demand

2003.7 --> 2007.1200000000001
system

2005.14 --> 2009.46
if you're gonna have it like spin at

2007.12 --> 2010.6589999999999
insane rates it short range yeah

2009.46 --> 2014.8600000000001
everything's going to be crushed in

2010.659 --> 2018.72
there but if you just use a long rail

2014.86 --> 2018.7199999999998
much more straight rail than

2019.779 --> 2025.019
it might be mad

2022.059 --> 2025.019
theoretically

2027.96 --> 2034.8600000000001
railgun also have been considered [ __ ]

2030.519 --> 2034.86
yeah but railgun is like no

2035.44 --> 2039.22
because the concept of the railgun is

2037.659 --> 2042.94
like

2039.22 --> 2045.46
like it literally disintegrates the

2042.94 --> 2047.38
material from the raw force of the

2045.46 --> 2050.379
acceleration

2047.38 --> 2053.079
like that's not

2050.379 --> 2053.919
that system is not meant

2053.079 --> 2058.5600000000004
foreign

2053.919 --> 2058.56
to launch any kind of object

2059.139 --> 2063.659
because everything's disintegrating in

2061.119 --> 2063.659
there so

2066.52 --> 2072.46
feeding my face with me ew X gen

2070.72 --> 2074.7599999999998
what are you doing why are you doing

2072.46 --> 2074.76
that

2077.919 --> 2082.98
ew

2079.78 --> 2082.98
why would you do that

2111.52 --> 2117.24
hey Michael come

2114.339 --> 2117.24
uh

2120.76 --> 2127.38
my buddies love McDonald's it's

2122.8 --> 2127.38
disgusting it's absolutely disgusting

2137.8 --> 2142.38
my bodies my rules yeah all right

2149.38 --> 2156.119
and just know that it has some pretty

2151.9 --> 2156.119
bad influences on the long run action

2157.0 --> 2164.92
like every time you do that you buy your

2159.48 --> 2168.54
accumulate like really bad chemicals

2164.92 --> 2168.54
that are going to be stuck to you

2170.32 --> 2172.92
so

2179.44 --> 2182.4
foreign

2186.4 --> 2191.6800000000003
it's been measured

2188.32 --> 2193.78
more than 2 000 years ago oh yes you

2191.68 --> 2195.8799999999997
mean calculated with a presupposition

2193.78 --> 2198.76
right that's not measuring you might

2195.88 --> 2200.02
want to use the right words for your

2198.76 --> 2202.98
claim

2200.02 --> 2202.98
Professor Phil

2203.02 --> 2208.079
nobody measured the radius of Earth

2209.859 --> 2216.94
at best they've measured Sun angles and

2214.3 --> 2219.2200000000003
then presuppose the Earth

2216.94 --> 2222.16
was a ball underneath

2219.22 --> 2224.2
and then triangulated

2222.16 --> 2226.42
like

2224.2 --> 2230.14
yeah well no no that's not even involved

2226.42 --> 2233.079
you just presuppose it's

2230.14 --> 2235.48
the sun is an object

2233.079 --> 2238.0
and the Earth is yeah a sphere

2235.48 --> 2239.98
underneath it and then no the sun angles

2238.0 --> 2242.44
kind of add up if you assume the

2239.98 --> 2245.82
sunlight is all parallel and all that

2242.44 --> 2245.82
right which it isn't

2250.24 --> 2254.64
and uh yeah eclipses prove that

2271.839 --> 2275.74
was derived I'm guessing the distance to

2274.42 --> 2279.64
feet what

2275.74 --> 2283.0789999999997
no I don't think so seeking style water

2279.64 --> 2283.0789999999997
distance to Venus

2288.16 --> 2293.74
now the the size of Venus was assumed to

2291.64 --> 2297.46
be the same size as Earth

2293.74 --> 2301.859
to set to Anchor this scale of the

2297.46 --> 2301.859
celestial bodies in relation to Earth

2303.88 --> 2311.28
I don't know any involvement of any

2307.72 --> 2311.2799999999997
presupposed distances

2311.32 --> 2317.04
to Venus

2313.06 --> 2317.04
don't think that's relevant to the model

2331.3 --> 2336.96
you've been gym rat okay

2334.119 --> 2336.96
well yeah

2337.42 --> 2342.3
I don't see how that would help you

2339.579 --> 2342.3
x-gen

2345.339 --> 2350.099
like by your accumulating poison is just

2348.18 --> 2354.64
bioaccumulating poison

2350.099 --> 2357.04
uh yeah you can jam all you like

2354.64 --> 2359.14
you're still gonna have it basically

2357.04 --> 2363.7799999999997
stuck to you

2359.14 --> 2363.7799999999997
unless you regularly detox

2365.56 --> 2371.44
because just sporting if you're then

2368.26 --> 2373.599
still gonna eat like really bad

2371.44 --> 2375.52
supposed food

2373.599 --> 2378.04
that's not really a good combination

2375.52 --> 2383.579
right

2378.04 --> 2383.579
heavy working out requires good food

2385.3 --> 2392.76
favorite food is Sushi okay well anyway

2389.04 --> 2392.7599999999998
it's your life dude

2441.18 --> 2445.839
clutch just

2443.26 --> 2447.46
that's kind of stupid

2445.839 --> 2450.0
if you know you're going to be sick

2447.46 --> 2453.9
isn't it technically better to just fast

2450.0 --> 2453.9
or I don't know maybe

2454.96 --> 2462.04
get some like organic food or like even

2458.619 --> 2464.6800000000003
organic granola bars or something

2462.04 --> 2468.819
to go with you if you know you're gonna

2464.68 --> 2471.339
be away for a while like why the hell

2468.819 --> 2473.74
would you just start eating like garbage

2471.339 --> 2476.319
like that just because you're away like

2473.74 --> 2479.319
ever since I started eating organic I

2476.319 --> 2481.18
was always taking my food with me always

2479.319 --> 2484.42
and drink

2481.18 --> 2487.4199999999996
filtered water drink always

2484.42 --> 2488.92
like wherever I go I

2487.42 --> 2492.3
yeah

2488.92 --> 2492.3
you just have your

2492.48 --> 2499.72
adventuring food pack with you because

2495.839 --> 2502.42
it's very unlikely you're gonna end up

2499.72 --> 2504.339
eating organic or even finding a place

2502.42 --> 2508.26
that has organic food

2504.339 --> 2508.2599999999998
if you don't know the region right

2508.42 --> 2511.839
so

2510.04 --> 2514.2
yeah maybe you should just prepare a

2511.839 --> 2514.2
little better

2523.859 --> 2530.52
they proved this and what

2527.8 --> 2530.52
dude

2530.74 --> 2538.5989999999997
that's but the sun rays are in parallel

2535.96 --> 2541.06
that's what you assume they aren't

2538.599 --> 2546.48
you understand

2541.06 --> 2546.48
Shadows don't change size of parallel

2551.099 --> 2558.28
what change size with parallel yeah they

2555.819 --> 2561.7599999999998
shouldn't but they do though

2558.28 --> 2562.96
remember the eclipse solar eclipse Umbra

2561.76 --> 2565.3
penumbra

2562.96 --> 2568.7400000000002
now take a ball

2565.3 --> 2572.079
a little ball or a big ball and shine a

2568.74 --> 2574.0
laser at it not a lamp

2572.079 --> 2577.42
at a distance because those are not

2574.0 --> 2581.079
parallel rays a laser

2577.42 --> 2585.2200000000003
and then make that laser

2581.079 --> 2588.78
create a shadow with an umbra and

2585.22 --> 2588.7799999999997
penumbra go

2589.359 --> 2594.7
let's see you do that

2591.099 --> 2597.3590000000004
create an umbra and penumbra Shadow with

2594.7 --> 2597.359
a laser

2597.88 --> 2601.7400000000002
come on

2599.14 --> 2601.74
do it

2602.079 --> 2607.3
right lasers parallel rays right that

2606.099 --> 2609.339
should work

2607.3 --> 2613.319
because you assume the sunlight is

2609.339 --> 2613.319
parallel not just a lamp

2614.2 --> 2620.02
like a regular light bulb which goes in

2617.14 --> 2622.42
all directions is not parallel light

2620.02 --> 2623.8
especially if you hold it close by and

2622.42 --> 2627.76
all that right

2623.8 --> 2630.099
so yeah to emulate the concept of

2627.76 --> 2632.6800000000003
parallel rays you're gonna have to need

2630.099 --> 2635.02
a laser because you probably don't have

2632.68 --> 2638.68
a light bulb bright enough

2635.02 --> 2640.72
to emulate the astronomical distances

2638.68 --> 2642.2799999999997
it's all just going to diffuse all over

2640.72 --> 2645.0989999999997
the place

2642.28 --> 2648.7000000000003
so just use a laser and then make it

2645.099 --> 2650.02
create an unraved number shadow

2648.7 --> 2651.9399999999996
there you go

2650.02 --> 2653.619
if you can achieve that

2651.94 --> 2656.92
then

2653.619 --> 2659.26
yeah then I will be satisfied that the

2656.92 --> 2661.2400000000002
sun parallel rays can create an

2659.26 --> 2664.7400000000002
umbramped number of Shadow during the

2661.24 --> 2664.74
eclipse how about that

2677.859 --> 2682.18
if you what are you talking about next

2679.96 --> 2684.96
gen not the same

2682.18 --> 2684.96
ah

2686.099 --> 2691.78
parallel rays x-gen

2689.56 --> 2694.92
it's about the parallel rays not

2691.78 --> 2694.92
diffusion ability

2698.5 --> 2705.4
right in normal setups you don't have

2701.44 --> 2707.56
the luxury to actually create those

2705.4 --> 2710.619
distances

2707.56 --> 2713.7999999999997
so you're gonna have to replace whatever

2710.619 --> 2716.56
you're doing concerning the light with

2713.8 --> 2720.3590000000004
something that is parallel so you could

2716.56 --> 2720.359
decrease the actual distance

2721.06 --> 2726.16
it's anything illusion yeah well it

2723.579 --> 2728.1400000000003
isn't a freaking giant ball of fire in

2726.16 --> 2731.5789999999997
the middle of a vacuum giving off

2728.14 --> 2731.5789999999997
parallel rays either

2739.72 --> 2745.24
so complainy I actually gave you a

2743.079 --> 2746.8
proper test to test your model now

2745.24 --> 2750.8999999999996
you're complaining with this and he's

2746.8 --> 2750.9
not a laser yeah no [ __ ] bro

2751.0 --> 2756.94
that you think that parallel race give

2754.42 --> 2759.7000000000003
off Umbra and penumbra Shadow so you

2756.94 --> 2762.2400000000002
might want to try to back that with some

2759.7 --> 2762.24
kind of test

2764.26 --> 2767.76
hello dank good to see you

2785.56 --> 2789.839
dude

2786.94 --> 2789.839
what the hell

2794.859 --> 2800.56
what is up with x-gen

2798.28 --> 2802.96
Echo chamber

2800.56 --> 2805.48
what Echo chamber you mean an echo

2802.96 --> 2807.76
chamber where we actually test

2805.48 --> 2810.46
your model

2807.76 --> 2815.079
and the claims

2810.46 --> 2817.66
oh no it's such an echo chamber sheesh

2815.079 --> 2820.2400000000002
where such an echo Chambers guys I mean

2817.66 --> 2823.56
x-gen I didn't even know he was a glober

2820.24 --> 2823.56
I genuinely didn't

2825.88 --> 2830.38
I thought he was a flat earther but

2827.44 --> 2832.8
apparently he was insulted by my actual

2830.38 --> 2832.8
test

2837.339 --> 2843.4
right the professor Phil is in here and

2840.7 --> 2845.9199999999996
Stone monkey is in here my God and I

2843.4 --> 2849.94
interact with all of them I am such an

2845.92 --> 2853.7400000000002
echo chamber guys can you believe it

2849.94 --> 2853.7400000000002
research in Echo chamber

2874.72 --> 2879.52
what

2876.22 --> 2881.68
he is talking to

2879.52 --> 2884.559
well I'm not getting that

2881.68 --> 2886.72
professor professor Phil was like way up

2884.559 --> 2887.8590000000004
there he hasn't really commented for a

2886.72 --> 2891.9599999999996
while so

2887.859 --> 2891.96
are you sure he was talking to him

2896.8 --> 2902.76
anyway he's not banned

2898.96 --> 2902.76
I got timed out by LSG

2914.14 --> 2916.319
foreign

2923.579 --> 2928.8590000000004
go back to your Echo chamber he was just

2926.5 --> 2928.859
saying

2931.48 --> 2936.0
have fun with your Echo chamber

2936.7 --> 2939.54
uh

2953.38 --> 2957.819
a jabber and a Glover and a pair oh

2955.96 --> 2959.859
George Central yeah well that's that's

2957.819 --> 2962.5589999999997
what I my conclusion was and he's a

2959.859 --> 2965.2799999999997
freaking McDonald's eater

2962.559 --> 2965.28
so

2966.099 --> 2968.6400000000003
right

2976.67 --> 2981.52
[Music]

2977.92 --> 2983.6800000000003
and watch tedx episode who was trying

2981.52 --> 2986.619
this hardest to persuade the audience a

2983.68 --> 2988.839
scientific method has to change

2986.619 --> 2990.579
oh we have to change it

2988.839 --> 2992.38
why

2990.579 --> 2995.5
it's too strict

2992.38 --> 2998.2000000000003
but it being so strict was what made it

2995.5 --> 2999.88
so useful yeah we know

2998.2 --> 3001.9199999999996
and we want to take that away again

2999.88 --> 3005.78
because we want to be able to spin our

3001.92 --> 3005.78
[ __ ] stories and call it science

3009.72 --> 3013.339
all right see you later Stone monkey

3021.119 --> 3024.119
foreign

3051.24 --> 3054.0789999999997
oops

3091.2 --> 3093.3799999999997
foreign

3119.52 --> 3123.54
what would the point be if cameras on

3121.859 --> 3127.64
the moon yeah what would be the point of

3123.54 --> 3127.64
cameras everywhere Professor Phil

3131.72 --> 3138.24
it would prove

3134.819 --> 3140.2799999999997
it's real that's what it would prove why

3138.24 --> 3141.0
would we do that why won't would we want

3140.28 --> 3144.42
to

3141.0 --> 3146.16
present physical proof of which we claim

3144.42 --> 3147.78
is the physical

3146.16 --> 3150.0
Eternal reality

3147.78 --> 3151.92
that they are physical object why do you

3150.0 --> 3155.819
want to prove that God why would you

3151.92 --> 3158.339
want cameras everywhere everywhere

3155.819 --> 3161.7799999999997
on the moon

3158.339 --> 3165.599
like on

3161.78 --> 3169.02
meteors like dude just like literally

3165.599 --> 3171.619
just shoot off little Rockets with like

3169.02 --> 3171.619
long distance

3172.14 --> 3177.5989999999997
communication systems and cameras it's

3175.02 --> 3180.0
like it could even be really cheap and

3177.599 --> 3181.559
just shoot them ever just pray spray

3180.0 --> 3185.76
shoot

3181.559 --> 3188.52
little tag on cameras that are like

3185.76 --> 3191.0400000000004
that can transmit their data and receive

3188.52 --> 3195.72
signals over vast distances I mean the

3191.04 --> 3197.7
radio technology is should be very easy

3195.72 --> 3199.68
now to build such things and you just

3197.7 --> 3202.2599999999998
spray shoot like thousands of those

3199.68 --> 3204.0589999999997
things everywhere and just get stuck on

3202.26 --> 3206.2200000000003
the moon and

3204.059 --> 3208.46
on Mars

3206.22 --> 3211.0789999999997
and on the rings of Saturn or something

3208.46 --> 3212.819
right everywhere

3211.079 --> 3216.3590000000004
and then you just have these freaking

3212.819 --> 3218.819
cameras just everywhere constantly 24 7

3216.359 --> 3220.14
showing like oh look oh we can now see

3218.819 --> 3222.24
the side of this

3220.14 --> 3224.04
Planet oh

3222.24 --> 3226.8799999999997
look there's the Earth and at the

3224.04 --> 3226.88
distance no

3227.4 --> 3232.559
yeah

3228.96 --> 3236.04
it would be very easy to do that and it

3232.559 --> 3238.3190000000004
would absolutely prove constantly

3236.04 --> 3241.2
that the heliocentric model is real

3238.319 --> 3243.38
that's why we would do that Professor

3241.2 --> 3243.3799999999997
Phil

3258.3 --> 3263.28
all right

3260.579 --> 3267.1800000000003
like if there are satellites up there

3263.28 --> 3270.6600000000003
why doesn't have every single satellite

3267.18 --> 3274.2599999999998
for like the last 20 years a

3270.66 --> 3276.54
standardized camera in there that's just

3274.26 --> 3279.42
active

3276.54 --> 3282.0589999999997
why doesn't every single satellite have

3279.42 --> 3285.2400000000002
a standardized camera on it because it's

3282.059 --> 3287.1600000000003
so easy so cheap like what would it cost

3285.24 --> 3289.5
like maybe

3287.16 --> 3291.8999999999996
I might wanna

3289.5 --> 3297.24
strong and isolate like oh that's gonna

3291.9 --> 3300.359
cost like maybe 100 to 500 euros extra

3297.24 --> 3303.0
it's very well worth it though

3300.359 --> 3305.64
I mean you could if you played clever

3303.0 --> 3308.88
you could even have the camera on it to

3305.64 --> 3311.46
check out if it is damaged like a camera

3308.88 --> 3313.98
that could basically move around on like

3311.46 --> 3317.099
a robotic arm so it could literally

3313.98 --> 3319.98
check out the condition of the satellite

3317.099 --> 3323.299
I mean why doesn't every single

3319.98 --> 3323.299
satellite have like that

3326.16 --> 3331.319
like this is not the 70s anymore we got

3329.16 --> 3334.92
Tech really

3331.319 --> 3337.5
heavy tack now it's super cheap why

3334.92 --> 3339.78
didn't they do that why didn't they just

3337.5 --> 3342.0
Implement that why doesn't every

3339.78 --> 3344.6400000000003
satellite have a camera

3342.0 --> 3347.299
every single one of them it would be so

3344.64 --> 3347.299
cheap to do

3359.4 --> 3363.859
no equipment works at those lots

3364.079 --> 3366.26
foreign

3366.42 --> 3371.94
yeah you can definitely make cameras

3369.599 --> 3373.6800000000003
design them

3371.94 --> 3377.0
to a function at extremely low

3373.68 --> 3377.0
temperatures yeah you can

3387.72 --> 3393.299
I mean if you can get solar panels to

3391.2 --> 3396.18
function at super low temperatures and

3393.299 --> 3398.88
regular Electronics then why wouldn't

3396.18 --> 3401.0989999999997
you be able to get a camera to work at

3398.88 --> 3403.859
super low temperatures right

3401.099 --> 3405.54
that doesn't make any sense the rest of

3403.859 --> 3408.5989999999997
the satellite is built to be able to

3405.54 --> 3411.66
handle that just hanging there

3408.599 --> 3414.48
then why wouldn't they be able to do

3411.66 --> 3416.46
that just with a standardized camera

3414.48 --> 3419.54
I mean if you standardize it it's going

3416.46 --> 3419.54
to be so dirt cheap

3419.64 --> 3424.0789999999997
because that's what that typically does

3421.98 --> 3426.0
you build something you design it yeah

3424.079 --> 3427.6800000000003
you have the design costs but then if

3426.0 --> 3430.52
you like produce it like a hundred

3427.68 --> 3430.52
thousand times

3433.319 --> 3437.04
then you can have it eventually built so

3436.319 --> 3439.079
cheap

3437.04 --> 3440.94
it wouldn't cost anything they would

3439.079 --> 3443.6400000000003
just have like those tag on camera

3440.94 --> 3445.859
systems to spare

3443.64 --> 3448.799
that's like even how mobile phone

3445.859 --> 3451.68
Revolution made mobile phone so it's

3448.799 --> 3453.059
Dirt Cheap yeah and freaking slave labor

3451.68 --> 3455.7
of course but

3453.059 --> 3458.0400000000004
it's because of the massive amount of

3455.7 --> 3461.46
production that it becomes so cheap it's

3458.04 --> 3462.599
like the industrial advantage

3461.46 --> 3466.2200000000003
so

3462.599 --> 3466.2200000000003
I don't see any excuse

3466.44 --> 3470.78
forty thousand dollars per kilogram

3473.599 --> 3480.1400000000003
1.5 million for that's [ __ ]

3477.359 --> 3485.04
Professor Phil that is straight out

3480.14 --> 3487.92
[ __ ] 1.5 million for a camera dude

3485.04 --> 3490.079
you can have a giant telescope made for

3487.92 --> 3492.92
that kind of money that's absolutely

3490.079 --> 3492.92
ridiculous

3493.02 --> 3499.2599999999998
no [ __ ] camera

3495.42 --> 3502.7400000000002
is gonna cost 1.5 million that's a total

3499.26 --> 3502.7400000000002
rip-off ridiculous

3505.74 --> 3511.6189999999997
I mean if you just let normal

3508.5 --> 3514.14
competition loose on that I bet they'll

3511.619 --> 3516.92
screw that price down right down to the

3514.14 --> 3516.92
50 bucks

3517.26 --> 3523.7990000000004
for 1.5 million for a cat that's

3520.619 --> 3526.319
absolutely ridiculous

3523.799 --> 3528.9
and besides forty thousand dollars per

3526.319 --> 3531.72
kilogram oh really

3528.9 --> 3534.1800000000003
you think they can make a camera

3531.72 --> 3536.9599999999996
that's like

3534.18 --> 3536.96
under

3537.359 --> 3542.18
50 grams

3539.46 --> 3542.18
less

3542.22 --> 3546.0
I mean doesn't have to like you you

3544.38 --> 3548.88
don't have to

3546.0 --> 3553.4
have it made by all these

3548.88 --> 3553.4
with all these really heavy materials

3553.74 --> 3560.8799999999997
and you can make it really small as well

3557.94 --> 3565.94
really small camera very lightweight so

3560.88 --> 3565.94
it's none of these are actual excuses

3568.74 --> 3575.5789999999997
dude price of one kilogram on the moon

3571.92 --> 3579.98
that's that's a giant ripoff Professor

3575.579 --> 3579.98
Phil that's like insane

3586.14 --> 3591.14
that's literally Monopoly rip-off prices

3591.66 --> 3594.5589999999997
ridiculous

3604.76 --> 3610.1600000000003
besides I wasn't really referring to the

3607.98 --> 3610.16
Moon

3610.559 --> 3614.579
just satellites up there right there's

3612.839 --> 3617.16
10 000 of them

3614.579 --> 3619.559
just have every new satellite equipped

3617.16 --> 3622.0789999999997
with a standardized

3619.559 --> 3625.7000000000003
simple camera system

3622.079 --> 3625.7000000000003
would not weigh anything

3626.099 --> 3631.38
barely anything and you just have easy

3628.92 --> 3633.66
camera access taking up very little

3631.38 --> 3636.599
electricity

3633.66 --> 3638.16
taking up very little weight and be yeah

3636.599 --> 3641.52
providing

3638.16 --> 3644.16
24 7 camera option like it wouldn't

3641.52 --> 3645.48
probably be rolling all the time but you

3644.16 --> 3648.54
could turn it on

3645.48 --> 3650.52
like that and just look around and even

3648.54 --> 3652.619
like check out the condition of the

3650.52 --> 3654.599
satellite hanging in there I think that

3652.619 --> 3656.7000000000003
would be a pretty valuable

3654.599 --> 3658.5
option

3656.7 --> 3661.3999999999996
for maintenance

3658.5 --> 3661.4
would you say

3661.74 --> 3667.0789999999997
I literally know the costs Oh you mean

3664.619 --> 3668.28
you're part of the club you know how the

3667.079 --> 3670.799
game works

3668.28 --> 3673.619
yeah it's called a rip-off professor

3670.799 --> 3676.619
Phil it's [ __ ]

3673.619 --> 3679.92
nobody's gonna buy

3676.619 --> 3682.2000000000003
that [ __ ] from you except maybe really

3679.92 --> 3685.5
stupid rich people that have trouble

3682.2 --> 3686.9399999999996
sizing up the scale of costs of things

3685.5 --> 3690.5
because they're like

3686.94 --> 3690.5
not very mechanical

3691.5 --> 3698.22
so they just go by crazy space prices

3694.16 --> 3700.3799999999997
right nobody's gonna buy

3698.22 --> 3703.339
at those prices is absolutely

3700.38 --> 3703.339
preposterous

3712.02 --> 3716.42
how much for the suspension wires

3718.559 --> 3724.2000000000003
not much it's mostly the actor's costs

3738.539 --> 3743.099
mapping inspires that like that again

3741.66 --> 3746.18
yeah

3743.099 --> 3746.1800000000003
sure they do

3746.76 --> 3753.119
yeah specific jobs yeah and

3750.24 --> 3754.5589999999997
you can just put a tiny little camera on

3753.119 --> 3757.1400000000003
there

3754.559 --> 3759.7400000000002
just for maintenance purposes to check

3757.14 --> 3759.74
out the condition

3778.799 --> 3784.64
a flat out conspiracy

3781.44 --> 3784.64
ask and receive

3809.24 --> 3814.74
yeah yeah nobody's buying it Professor

3812.16 --> 3817.319
Phil you're just sounding like a giant

3814.74 --> 3818.9399999999996
giant gatekeeper and you sound like

3817.319 --> 3820.14
you're in the know that you're a

3818.94 --> 3822.2400000000002
gatekeeper

3820.14 --> 3824.839
because your counter arguments are

3822.24 --> 3824.839
ridiculous

3826.98 --> 3830.819
I haven't really provided any you're

3828.839 --> 3833.16
just making up excuses oh it costs too

3830.819 --> 3836.339
much oh do you have a specific function

3833.16 --> 3838.44
they don't need it oh sure sure they

3836.339 --> 3841.799
don't need it

3838.44 --> 3842.94
I mean who who would ever like want to

3841.799 --> 3845.099
invest

3842.94 --> 3847.319
in a thing

3845.099 --> 3848.94
where they could quickly check if

3847.319 --> 3851.22
everything is all right on the device

3848.94 --> 3853.26
that cost you so much to launch up there

3851.22 --> 3855.18
why would you have the ability to just

3853.26 --> 3856.44
quickly visually check out if everything

3855.18 --> 3859.859
is all right

3856.44 --> 3862.44
on the on the device at a whims at a

3859.859 --> 3864.839
whim like why would you want that

3862.44 --> 3866.099
ability to check your super expensive

3864.839 --> 3868.799
investment

3866.099 --> 3870.839
I mean nobody wants that you want it to

3868.799 --> 3873.119
just pay giant amount of money see your

3870.839 --> 3875.0389999999998
rocket go up there and then have a

3873.119 --> 3878.28
computer readout and if it doesn't work

3875.039 --> 3880.8590000000004
you just leave it to the the the guys

3878.28 --> 3883.079
that handle that and you're just gonna

3880.859 --> 3885.5389999999998
have to trust them oh yeah man that's

3883.079 --> 3886.98
just great

3885.539 --> 3889.92
or

3886.98 --> 3891.539
for just a little extra

3889.92 --> 3895.039
you could have a little camera on it and

3891.539 --> 3895.039
then you could literally just like oh

3895.28 --> 3900.42
I wonder how my satellite is doing my

3898.26 --> 3902.099
giant investment I'm just gonna take a

3900.42 --> 3905.4
look around on that camera for a little

3902.099 --> 3907.26
and then be feeling all great about the

3905.4 --> 3908.94
good investment

3907.26 --> 3911.099
that I'm assured that it's still

3908.94 --> 3914.88
operating and it's there's no scratches

3911.099 --> 3917.039
no micro meteorites I mean why would I

3914.88 --> 3919.799
why would I want to have that security

3917.039 --> 3922.88
about my massive investment in that

3919.799 --> 3922.88
satellite you know

3927.9 --> 3931.1600000000003
yeah yeah yeah yeah

3931.339 --> 3935.46
massive cameras yeah but I'm not talking

3933.72 --> 3937.5
about those satellites which are

3935.46 --> 3939.539
obviously secret nobody's going to be

3937.5 --> 3943.02
able to interface with I'm talking about

3939.539 --> 3944.6400000000003
commercial satellites

3943.02 --> 3948.119
yeah

3944.64 --> 3952.2
corporate satellites

3948.119 --> 3956.2200000000003
not military [ __ ] Professor Phil

3952.2 --> 3959.64
stop moving the argument

3956.22 --> 3961.859
I'm talking about corporate invested

3959.64 --> 3964.44
satellites

3961.859 --> 3966.359
not spy satellites yeah you don't have

3964.44 --> 3968.76
to tell me yeah we claim there are

3966.359 --> 3970.74
satellites up there with camera yeah we

3968.76 --> 3972.7200000000003
know you claimed that that's not what

3970.74 --> 3975.839
I'm talking about why don't you stop

3972.72 --> 3978.319
trying to move the subject I'm talking

3975.839 --> 3981.9
about Universal

3978.319 --> 3984.5
Universal cheap added on cameras so

3981.9 --> 3986.88
people that actually buy a satellite

3984.5 --> 3988.799
have it launched up that could quickly

3986.88 --> 3991.02
check like what's the condition of this

3988.799 --> 3993.24
thing right it would be a giant kick

3991.02 --> 3996.059
just to be able to do that just like

3993.24 --> 3998.0989999999997
little camera pop out there look around

3996.059 --> 3999.78
and you can literally then just see the

3998.099 --> 4002.839
condition of the satellite and the solar

3999.78 --> 4005.48
panels and like oh are these lights

4002.839 --> 4007.94
still blinking Etc that would be cool

4005.48 --> 4008.96
and be like oh thank God my satellite's

4007.94 --> 4010.099
safe

4008.96 --> 4013.039
right

4010.099 --> 4016.039
why isn't that there

4013.039 --> 4017.0
right and I would love to have the

4016.039 --> 4018.98
luxury

4017.0 --> 4021.26
if I'm gonna have a satellite where up

4018.98 --> 4023.96
there to just once in a while use that

4021.26 --> 4026.48
camera to take a peek down to earth and

4023.96 --> 4027.319
just see the beautiful Globe Earth down

4026.48 --> 4029.119
there

4027.319 --> 4031.2799999999997
and like see oh where's it hanging right

4029.119 --> 4033.7400000000002
now if it's a if it's not a

4031.28 --> 4036.3190000000004
geostationary satellite you see like oh

4033.74 --> 4040.8799999999997
it's over there it's like going over

4036.319 --> 4043.7599999999998
Africa or over China or something right

4040.88 --> 4046.1600000000003
you made the giant investment why not

4043.76 --> 4048.5
add that little thing to it

4046.16 --> 4050.18
for yeah

4048.5 --> 4052.78
just because you can because it's

4050.18 --> 4052.7799999999997
freaking cheap

4054.2 --> 4057.799
we don't need to say oh you don't need

4056.72 --> 4059.24
it

4057.799 --> 4061.819
well I bet there's a whole bunch of

4059.24 --> 4067.0389999999998
people that really like satellites that

4061.819 --> 4069.94
would love it they would love it yeah

4067.039 --> 4074.7200000000003
maybe I should just start a corporation

4069.94 --> 4077.42
specifically to create satellites

4074.72 --> 4079.64
with cameras on them it's like

4077.42 --> 4082.339
satellite webcam

4079.64 --> 4084.3799999999997
you could just like a satellite it's not

4082.339 --> 4087.14
even gonna do anything it's just there

4084.38 --> 4089.599
with a basic camera

4087.14 --> 4092.14
so you could just quickly look down on

4089.599 --> 4092.1400000000003
Globe Earth

4092.599 --> 4096.92
right maybe you'll see even see the ISS

4094.94 --> 4099.259
pass by every now and then it will be

4096.92 --> 4101.359
awesome but what a great investment to

4099.259 --> 4103.819
just be able to have that little eye up

4101.359 --> 4107.56
there in the sky not a spy satellite not

4103.819 --> 4110.900000000001
to ooh military secret no just a regular

4107.56 --> 4114.339000000001
camera up there

4110.9 --> 4114.339
so you can look at everything

4116.12 --> 4120.679
like wouldn't you want that wouldn't you

4118.4 --> 4123.08
want that Professor Phil so you could

4120.679 --> 4125.179
like oh Flat Earth oh certain Lords

4123.08 --> 4127.219
don't exist and you're like no no no I

4125.179 --> 4129.14
actually have a satellite right now in

4127.219 --> 4130.759
orbit you want to see it

4129.14 --> 4133.339
well here you go here you got the link

4130.759 --> 4135.52
there's a live camera interface right

4133.339 --> 4135.5199999999995
there

4136.339 --> 4142.159
I have the control codes and I am gonna

4139.4 --> 4144.44
make it look around so you could see

4142.159 --> 4146.92
that it's actually a satellite hanging

4144.44 --> 4146.919999999999
in there

4149.179 --> 4155.12
right

4150.92 --> 4156.62
but no oh we why would you want why

4155.12 --> 4159.219
would you want that why would you want

4156.62 --> 4159.219
to have that

4159.259 --> 4163.819
evidence to shove into a flat earther's

4161.839 --> 4167.48
face

4163.819 --> 4170.779
right why why would you want that

4167.48 --> 4172.839
I mean you don't need that well then we

4170.779 --> 4176.080000000001
don't need it

4172.839 --> 4176.08
yeah right

4187.52 --> 4192.4400000000005
yeah seeking style water and besides

4189.679 --> 4195.38
it's not just like oh we're gonna design

4192.44 --> 4197.0
one special camera no you could

4195.38 --> 4200.06
literally

4197.0 --> 4202.52
do it mass production Style

4200.06 --> 4205.280000000001
right this is not about a telescope

4202.52 --> 4206.780000000001
sending it up there this is about just a

4205.28 --> 4208.46
camera

4206.78 --> 4210.199
that you could basically attach to

4208.46 --> 4212.719
anything if you start Mass producing

4210.199 --> 4213.799999999999
those and make like a hundred thousand

4212.719 --> 4216.08
of them

4213.8 --> 4219.62
then it'll turn out to be pretty cheap

4216.08 --> 4223.12
pretty cheap to add on add on to it who

4219.62 --> 4223.12
would it pay for it myself

4223.76 --> 4227.719
how would you fund it

4225.92 --> 4230.42
it's very simple

4227.719 --> 4233.179
you just put it in an option in the

4230.42 --> 4235.159
package as you sell somebody a satellite

4233.179 --> 4235.88
you just say hey you want a camera on

4235.159 --> 4240.4
there

4235.88 --> 4240.400000000001
to look around check out the satellite

4240.679 --> 4246.92
right take some views from down there

4244.88 --> 4248.96
I mean

4246.92 --> 4250.76
I don't know let's just make it

4248.96 --> 4253.82
expensive say like okay it's gonna cost

4250.76 --> 4255.56
like 500 extra

4253.82 --> 4257.719
I think there will be a whole bunch of

4255.56 --> 4260.120000000001
guys that are fans of space I didn't

4257.719 --> 4261.7390000000005
happen to have money in business that

4260.12 --> 4263.84
they need a satellite that'll be like oh

4261.739 --> 4266.299999999999
yeah man I want to take a look at that

4263.84 --> 4268.9400000000005
the nice Adventure it will be all the

4266.3 --> 4272.06
trend it will be all the rage dude this

4268.94 --> 4274.46
is like a great business plan actually

4272.06 --> 4276.56
why are you

4274.46 --> 4277.76
why are you pushing that away so much

4276.56 --> 4281.6
Professor Phil

4277.76 --> 4284.6
I'm innovating I'm innovating for space

4281.6 --> 4284.6
technology

4286.1 --> 4290.320000000001
what you have something against

4287.6 --> 4290.320000000001
innovation

4293.78 --> 4300.199
nobody I know in the satellite industry

4296.48 --> 4302.9
thinks about flat earthers except you

4300.199 --> 4305.0599999999995
you're in the space industry aren't you

4302.9 --> 4307.219
you've built out well you're thinking

4305.06 --> 4308.96
about it you come over here every day

4307.219 --> 4312.199
Professor Phil

4308.96 --> 4314.659
so yeah you do know somebody that thinks

4312.199 --> 4317.199
about flat earthers a lot

4314.659 --> 4317.199
you

4349.04 --> 4351.219
foreign

4367.159 --> 4372.92
yeah must trigger him so badly well flat

4370.28 --> 4375.5599999999995
out conspiracy I think now because of

4372.92 --> 4380.179
the conduct of Professor Phil

4375.56 --> 4383.900000000001
he's not a genuine glober I think he is

4380.179 --> 4388.1
a knowing lying GateKeeper he knows it's

4383.9 --> 4391.78
all a lie he might actually be paid

4388.1 --> 4391.780000000001
to keep this under wraps

4393.86 --> 4399.08
the field manipulator because why the

4397.159 --> 4400.339999999999
hell would you object to something like

4399.08 --> 4405.82
that

4400.34 --> 4405.82
when it's a space promoting opportunity

4407.42 --> 4412.46
ridiculous

4409.04 --> 4414.44
the only reason I can think of is why he

4412.46 --> 4416.78
makes endless excuses why we can't do

4414.44 --> 4421.099999999999
that we shouldn't do that

4416.78 --> 4423.5599999999995
is because he knows it's fake

4421.1 --> 4427.58
why else would that why the hell else

4423.56 --> 4430.219
would you object to that it's ridiculous

4427.58 --> 4432.86
you're a liar Professor Phil you have to

4430.219 --> 4435.02
be a liar because if you actually

4432.86 --> 4437.12
believed all this

4435.02 --> 4439.9400000000005
then why would you object that's

4437.12 --> 4441.86
absolutely ridiculous

4439.94 --> 4446.419999999999
yeah you just enjoyed the conversation

4441.86 --> 4448.159
yeah sure you do oh no I think you are a

4446.42 --> 4451.46
knowing liar

4448.159 --> 4454.04
not a fooled person you know you're

4451.46 --> 4457.28
lying you are actively engaging in

4454.04 --> 4460.88
gatekeeping an idea that a real believer

4457.28 --> 4463.58
would absolutely not object to

4460.88 --> 4465.679
you're a liar and a gatekeeper Professor

4463.58 --> 4468.44
Phil

4465.679 --> 4470.719
there is no logical reason for somebody

4468.44 --> 4473.9
who believes in satellite in space to

4470.719 --> 4476.96
object to my idea unless they knew it

4473.9 --> 4479.839999999999
was fake and they needed the lie to be

4476.96 --> 4482.4800000000005
believed out there so you make effort to

4479.84 --> 4486.5
prevent people from going there

4482.48 --> 4488.54
you're a liar Professor Phil

4486.5 --> 4490.96
I'm not gonna boot him but I will call

4488.54 --> 4490.96
him out

4492.08 --> 4496.239
you're a creepy GateKeeper

4512.659 --> 4517.759999999999
don't anybody dare time him out or boot

4515.54 --> 4520.82
him don't you dare no matter what he

4517.76 --> 4523.159000000001
does no matter what he does you do not

4520.82 --> 4525.739
time him out you do not ban him if you

4523.159 --> 4528.4
do your rent is immediately revoked

4525.739 --> 4528.4
immediately

4530.179 --> 4534.62
not objecting hundreds of satellites

4532.94 --> 4536.659
with a camera as I told yeah but not

4534.62 --> 4539.0
like that though not one that's

4536.659 --> 4542.179
accessible that could actually look

4539.0 --> 4544.82
around the satellite itself

4542.179 --> 4548.719
right yeah I know

4544.82 --> 4551.12
I know you objected that idea

4548.719 --> 4553.88
easy access

4551.12 --> 4556.36
basic cameras they could check out the

4553.88 --> 4556.36
satellite

4557.12 --> 4562.34
Maybe

4558.56 --> 4564.38
take a quick peek down to earth

4562.34 --> 4567.02
you know why wouldn't you want to see

4564.38 --> 4569.659000000001
glowbirth down there like any at any

4567.02 --> 4572.84
moment just live

4569.659 --> 4574.5199999999995
like I would want to see that like what

4572.84 --> 4577.82
if there was like a

4574.52 --> 4580.820000000001
a new launch of some kind like Elon Musk

4577.82 --> 4583.159
or whoever Bezos launches some new thing

4580.82 --> 4585.44
and you just happen to know that your

4583.159 --> 4588.62
satellite

4585.44 --> 4591.5
is kind of around that region right when

4588.62 --> 4594.199
the launch is dude I'd freaking log into

4591.5 --> 4597.02
my camera that alone would be worth the

4594.199 --> 4597.919999999999
investment if I could literally from up

4597.02 --> 4602.659000000001
there

4597.92 --> 4605.6
watch the rocket on my own camera on my

4602.659 --> 4607.46
satellite see it go dude that's awesome

4605.6 --> 4611.3
that's

4607.46 --> 4613.52
that's alone is enough reason to

4611.3 --> 4616.219
to take that extra

4613.52 --> 4619.120000000001
cost I would absolutely do that if I

4616.219 --> 4619.12
believed any of it

4625.52 --> 4631.0
now logical conclusion this is not about

4628.04 --> 4632.6
me

4631.0 --> 4636.199
dismissing

4632.6 --> 4638.84
things this is about presupposing it's

4636.199 --> 4643.099999999999
real and what do you do with it right

4638.84 --> 4644.54
his entire premise is actually from a

4643.1 --> 4646.46
perspective

4644.54 --> 4649.82
where you believe it's all real and that

4646.46 --> 4653.3
satellites are really hanging up there

4649.82 --> 4655.099999999999
well if they are then what why would you

4653.3 --> 4657.320000000001
just have an easy camera hanging in

4655.1 --> 4661.34
there that you could like

4657.32 --> 4662.78
have recorded for a week straight if you

4661.34 --> 4665.900000000001
wanted to

4662.78 --> 4668.96
like you know actual 24-hour footage of

4665.9 --> 4670.099999999999
Earth unlike the ISS

4668.96 --> 4674.44
right

4670.1 --> 4674.4400000000005
yeah I know I know it's troublesome

4675.679 --> 4681.14
but my idea is based on the premise that

4679.04 --> 4683.56
the Earth is a globe and that satellites

4681.14 --> 4683.56
are real

4693.02 --> 4697.76
oh yeah well the good point there

4694.4 --> 4699.379999999999
geoshifter why yeah Elon Musk now the

4697.76 --> 4702.64
single camera with them yeah why

4699.38 --> 4702.64
wouldn't he that's just stupid

4704.0 --> 4707.62
yeah I don't care Professor Phil

4708.38 --> 4714.6990000000005
I don't need to hear more of your

4710.3 --> 4714.6990000000005
excuses you've already revealed yourself

4715.34 --> 4719.659000000001
if you were actually for space

4717.5 --> 4722.84
technology development you would have

4719.659 --> 4725.9
been all over my idea and complimented

4722.84 --> 4728.12
me on what a great idea it is because it

4725.9 --> 4730.46
is within the possibility of range in

4728.12 --> 4733.099999999999
this current age with the technological

4730.46 --> 4734.78
developments and the options of mass

4733.1 --> 4737.84
production

4734.78 --> 4739.94
yeah you would have been all over that

4737.84 --> 4742.64
and being like man that's a really great

4739.94 --> 4746.239
idea instead you've been doing nothing

4742.64 --> 4748.159000000001
but making excuses why we shouldn't do

4746.239 --> 4750.919999999999
that

4748.159 --> 4753.739
like it like a straight out NASA

4750.92 --> 4757.46
operative oh we can't go back

4753.739 --> 4761.178999999999
lots of technology is too difficult oh

4757.46 --> 4763.699
it was too expensive we can't fit it ugh

4761.179 --> 4766.04
it's going to take more time oh yeah

4763.699 --> 4768.44
that's what you've been doing

4766.04 --> 4772.94
making excuses

4768.44 --> 4775.759999999999
moving away oh but we have cameras spy

4772.94 --> 4778.099999999999
satellite yeah those are not accessible

4775.76 --> 4780.56
those are not regular look around

4778.1 --> 4784.3
cameras right we're not talking about

4780.56 --> 4787.9400000000005
super high resolution telescope like

4784.3 --> 4791.360000000001
cameras I'm talking about regular basic

4787.94 --> 4793.82
cameras you just stick them on there

4791.36 --> 4797.0
maybe a little Arm System so it could

4793.82 --> 4799.58
actually like eject look around whatever

4797.0 --> 4801.38
something really basic it doesn't have

4799.58 --> 4805.1
to weigh anything it doesn't have to be

4801.38 --> 4809.12
expensive to make it really cheap add-on

4805.1 --> 4811.400000000001
easy access cheap add-on camera that's

4809.12 --> 4813.38
what I was talking about

4811.4 --> 4817.299999999999
yeah

4813.38 --> 4817.3
you don't seem to like it very much

4828.739 --> 4834.138999999999
dude if I'd be like if let's just say I

4832.04 --> 4837.5
work for a telephone company

4834.139 --> 4838.82
right you need your satellites

4837.5 --> 4842.6
apparently

4838.82 --> 4845.96
dude I'd be like bored in that job

4842.6 --> 4849.5
I I'd want that camera on my satellite

4845.96 --> 4852.38
just so it could get the guys over and

4849.5 --> 4855.02
brag like check this out guys I got this

4852.38 --> 4857.659000000001
new camera on my satellite look at this

4855.02 --> 4862.280000000001
and they'd be like whoa whoa

4857.659 --> 4864.679
that's really modern of you dude

4862.28 --> 4866.719
like that would be worth millions to

4864.679 --> 4869.12
guys like that

4866.719 --> 4871.52
the option to be able to brag and just

4869.12 --> 4873.62
show dude I'm part of the Space Age

4871.52 --> 4877.9400000000005
check out my satellite

4873.62 --> 4881.179
look at that man dude

4877.94 --> 4882.739
I mean am I being super unreasonable

4881.179 --> 4885.28
here

4882.739 --> 4885.28
right

4911.06 --> 4914.54
that's an employee yeah we're not

4912.679 --> 4917.84
talking about NASA employees that's

4914.54 --> 4919.58
weird by the way Charlie Welch really

4917.84 --> 4922.159000000001
they do

4919.58 --> 4924.86
you gotta show me like

4922.159 --> 4927.379999999999
footage of that if that's real Charlie

4924.86 --> 4930.139
Welch I want to see NASA employees with

4927.38 --> 4932.900000000001
NASA lies t-shirts

4930.139 --> 4934.639
that would be special

4932.9 --> 4936.679
because you might be right they might

4934.639 --> 4938.06
actually be doing because NASA knows

4936.679 --> 4940.9400000000005
they're lying

4938.06 --> 4944.120000000001
and they knows they know

4940.94 --> 4946.4
people buying right NASA knows they're

4944.12 --> 4948.8
lying they know people buying so yeah

4946.4 --> 4952.0
why wouldn't you put on the shirt just

4948.8 --> 4952.0
The Gaslight somewhat

4953.0 --> 4956.38
I wouldn't be surprised

4960.139 --> 4964.1
if I show you footage what are you

4962.6 --> 4966.8
talking about I'm not talking about

4964.1 --> 4969.620000000001
showing a flat Earth or footage I'm not

4966.8 --> 4972.02
talking about oh let's try to convince

4969.62 --> 4973.88
the flat earthers

4972.02 --> 4975.860000000001
right because from your perspective

4973.88 --> 4979.219
we've already made up our minds we got

4975.86 --> 4981.139
this arguments like this like arguments

4979.219 --> 4982.699
physics and all that nonsense right who

4981.139 --> 4984.8
needs that

4982.699 --> 4987.739
you could just have a cheap little

4984.8 --> 4989.54
camera added onto your satellite that

4987.739 --> 4992.178999999999
you paid for

4989.54 --> 4995.139
and like brag to your buddies it's not

4992.179 --> 4998.2390000000005
to show Flat Earth oh look it's real

4995.139 --> 4999.9800000000005
like Flat Earth will figure out a way to

4998.239 --> 5001.0
basically counter that anyway we always

4999.98 --> 5003.04
do

5001.0 --> 5006.3
now this is about just being able to

5003.04 --> 5006.3
brag to your buddies

5006.639 --> 5011.9800000000005
right to your to your staff if you're

5009.82 --> 5013.659
like a corporate head

5011.98 --> 5015.699
that's what it's this is not about

5013.659 --> 5018.219
proving to Flat Earth or that it's a

5015.699 --> 5020.739
ball this is about just general

5018.219 --> 5023.92
convenience that people would want to

5020.739 --> 5026.678999999999
pay for and that could be done

5023.92 --> 5027.6990000000005
that's what this is industry I'm talking

5026.679 --> 5030.659
about

5027.699 --> 5030.659
industry

5031.48 --> 5035.739
yeah I'm not talking about convincing

5033.34 --> 5038.639
flat earthers it's ridiculous why would

5035.739 --> 5038.638999999999
you drag that in there

5043.0 --> 5049.42
you go again that's a short no I'm not

5046.48 --> 5051.699
talking I don't ever have to see it this

5049.42 --> 5053.92
is for them

5051.699 --> 5056.699
this is for the guys that actually buy

5053.92 --> 5056.6990000000005
satellites

5056.739 --> 5064.5599999999995
I just wanna make it worth it to them

5061.96 --> 5064.56
you know

5065.08 --> 5069.58
I kind of feel bad for them they they

5067.0 --> 5071.679
pray pay lots of money and they never

5069.58 --> 5073.84
get to see anything

5071.679 --> 5075.639
I mean why can't they just add on a

5073.84 --> 5077.56
little camera so they could have fun

5075.639 --> 5079.900000000001
with their investment

5077.56 --> 5081.1
and play around with their buddies just

5079.9 --> 5083.638999999999
to show them

5081.1 --> 5083.639
you know

5088.739 --> 5091.919999999999
all right

5092.5 --> 5097.199
not be okay that was unexpected

5099.46 --> 5104.7390000000005
right yeah it is a good idea and there's

5102.88 --> 5108.0
nothing you could do about it

5104.739 --> 5108.0
it is a good idea

5108.46 --> 5112.6
now

5109.96 --> 5114.88
the reality is of course if you're gonna

5112.6 --> 5117.46
Implement a stunt like that

5114.88 --> 5120.159000000001
can you build a system that would

5117.46 --> 5123.159
actually enable the trickery to keep

5120.159 --> 5125.799999999999
going because there's a good reason the

5123.159 --> 5127.659
ISS doesn't have 24 7 footage really

5125.8 --> 5129.820000000001
it's just cut together it's a good

5127.659 --> 5132.46
reason for that

5129.82 --> 5134.86
because if they would have been able to

5132.46 --> 5138.52
just do that then they would have just

5134.86 --> 5140.44
done that so in order for this fakery to

5138.52 --> 5142.120000000001
continue with cameras on satellites

5140.44 --> 5144.5199999999995
they're gonna have to make up some

5142.12 --> 5147.719
really good system

5144.52 --> 5151.120000000001
to basically live shape video

5147.719 --> 5153.82
moving video moving camera video

5151.12 --> 5155.8
into a ball Earth in a very convincing

5153.82 --> 5158.62
way that it would actually use live

5155.8 --> 5161.08
footage and not just a

5158.62 --> 5163.54
mapped out

5161.08 --> 5166.48
rendered CGI

5163.54 --> 5169.3
right that's difficult

5166.48 --> 5170.678999999999
to live

5169.3 --> 5173.679
shape

5170.679 --> 5175.36
real footage the live mold real food

5173.679 --> 5178.36
that's really difficult and that's

5175.36 --> 5181.0
probably why they haven't done it yet

5178.36 --> 5184.62
I mean the the era is approaching where

5181.0 --> 5184.62
they can definitely do that

5185.679 --> 5190.96
but they haven't

5187.96 --> 5193.06
just yet but you would need that in

5190.96 --> 5195.94
order for an actual stunt like little

5193.06 --> 5198.400000000001
cameras on every satellite to work

5195.94 --> 5201.58
you're gonna have to provide for real

5198.4 --> 5204.46
because even if it just if it's just

5201.58 --> 5207.94
footage of the earth and there's no real

5204.46 --> 5210.46
life footage involvement then people are

5207.94 --> 5213.159
gonna be like but my satellite is

5210.46 --> 5214.96
hanging right over the launch area why

5213.159 --> 5216.759999999999
am I not seeing the launch with my

5214.96 --> 5218.92
camera

5216.76 --> 5221.280000000001
right there will be complications if

5218.92 --> 5221.28
they don't

5221.56 --> 5224.88
yeah I'm

5225.88 --> 5230.1
yeah I'm getting lost

5231.659 --> 5236.0199999999995
presupposition of reality from a

5233.98 --> 5238.178999999999
designer's standpoint

5236.02 --> 5240.159000000001
Flat Earth counter argument it's getting

5238.179 --> 5241.9
kind of mixed up now I don't know what

5240.159 --> 5243.759999999999
I'm doing anymore

5241.9 --> 5247.5599999999995
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

5243.76 --> 5247.56
show this has been quite weird

5250.719 --> 5256.4800000000005
also now the the title that I designated

5254.62 --> 5259.239
my show with

5256.48 --> 5261.339999999999
is like has a really weird multiple

5259.239 --> 5264.12
meaning now in relation to what we've

5261.34 --> 5264.12
been talking about

5264.3 --> 5271.0
oh sometimes it's a real blast being me

5268.12 --> 5272.739
but it can be a little confusing

5271.0 --> 5275.46
how

5272.739 --> 5275.459999999999
anyway

5275.8 --> 5280.54
thanks everyone for coming

5278.199 --> 5283.48
I hope you enjoyed this show

5280.54 --> 5285.699
I thought it was interesting

5283.48 --> 5288.159
certainly I'm pretty sure I made a lot

5285.699 --> 5290.919999999999
of people think in different ways

5288.159 --> 5294.46
right and not just polarization oh it's

5290.92 --> 5296.38
so fake oh it's so real no it's like how

5294.46 --> 5299.679
would it work and then things kind of

5296.38 --> 5303.1
like mix in that's where I like it

5299.679 --> 5306.46
because that's where sadly it it kind of

5303.1 --> 5307.96
doesn't matter anymore what is real you

5306.46 --> 5310.84
just you just

5307.96 --> 5313.4800000000005
respond to what is presupposed to be

5310.84 --> 5317.02
real and doesn't matter anymore what is

5313.48 --> 5319.0
real you just go with the system and

5317.02 --> 5321.6990000000005
then you continue on it's basically

5319.0 --> 5325.62
science fiction

5321.699 --> 5325.62
that's what I also like to do

5327.699 --> 5332.259999999999
right and you can use science fiction

5329.739 --> 5334.48
also to kind of poke around to those

5332.26 --> 5336.639
yeah with those that actually know it's

5334.48 --> 5339.099999999999
fake that are gatekeeping and they will

5336.639 --> 5341.5
be very much squirming over it as

5339.1 --> 5344.26
Professor Phil has although it was

5341.5 --> 5345.76
wisely changed his tune at the last

5344.26 --> 5347.26
minute

5345.76 --> 5350.1990000000005
anyway

5347.26 --> 5352.4800000000005

5350.199 --> 5354.099999999999
