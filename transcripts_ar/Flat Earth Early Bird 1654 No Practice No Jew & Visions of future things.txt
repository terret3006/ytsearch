100.56 --> 103.759
cloudish though

103.92 --> 109.02
a little bit just a tiny little bit

106.979 --> 112.52
really

109.02 --> 112.52
it's mostly just blue

112.92 --> 115.959
[Music]

116.52 --> 119.36
and hot

120.24 --> 126.36
it is hot oh

122.899 --> 129.119
bird some water

126.36 --> 131.58
I should do that hold on I'm gonna do

129.119 --> 133.08
that right now

131.58 --> 135.0
because it's really hot out there and

133.08 --> 137.22
they really need it and it's I looked

135.0 --> 140.28
it's completely dry so

137.22 --> 142.8
I believe we forgot right anyway

140.28 --> 146.16
hello zept happy first in chat

142.8 --> 152.04000000000002
Alaric 87

146.16 --> 152.04
it is Saturday the 8th of July 2023

155.94 --> 160.44
temperature

157.28 --> 161.64000000000001
32 degrees yes

160.44 --> 166.459
yep

161.64 --> 166.45899999999997
says it's going to be 33 even ooh

167.0 --> 170.78
Illuminati level Heat

171.42 --> 176.7
yeah it's hot and I've already been out

173.819 --> 178.73899999999998
for groceries and it felt hot

176.7 --> 180.23899999999998
so anyway I'm gonna give those birds

178.739 --> 184.04
some water

180.239 --> 184.04
well take me just a minute

207.019 --> 212.12
wow it's scorching up there

218.06 --> 221.06
thank you

331.979 --> 338.419
all right

334.5 --> 338.419
so that a big bowl of water

339.18 --> 343.56
it's a little sprinkle of salt in it

341.699 --> 348.0
because that's

343.56 --> 351.02
keeps them water inside it then

348.0 --> 351.02
that's hygienic

378.6 --> 382.259
right and of course works on with the

380.52 --> 385.79999999999995
Energizer

382.259 --> 388.08000000000004
right so I'm gonna give it one to five

385.8 --> 390.0
minutes before a jackdaw finds it and

388.08 --> 392.479
immediately weighs two-thirds of it

390.0 --> 392.479
bathing

393.24 --> 399.199
but I mean I'm not gonna blame him

396.9 --> 399.19899999999996
because

399.66 --> 403.03900000000004
it's just so hot

407.039 --> 410.039
anyway

413.52 --> 419.75899999999996
low Cleary septepi

417.3 --> 422.78000000000003
moxie

419.759 --> 422.78000000000003
George Sanford

423.72 --> 429.74
Okay so who's your lineup

426.6 --> 429.74
but hello welcome

430.68 --> 434.639
early bird gets the water yeah pretty

433.199 --> 438.06
much

434.639 --> 440.039
I mean I'll still refill it but

438.06 --> 442.38
those birds have absolutely no

440.039 --> 444.65999999999997
conception of like hey maybe this is

442.38 --> 448.15999999999997
like a really precious drinking resource

444.66 --> 448.16
for all the birds

448.74 --> 453.66
they don't seem to care

451.199 --> 456.24
right anyway I got the Gusto energy

453.66 --> 458.759
drink but it's an unusual variant

456.24 --> 462.18
because the regular one was all sold out

458.759 --> 464.58000000000004
so this is the Lemon version

462.18 --> 466.639
and yeah just I've never tried that

464.58 --> 469.5
before

466.639 --> 472.52
it is kind of just like a lemony drink

469.5 --> 476.539
but I think just the same

472.52 --> 476.539
ginseng is in there and all that

477.66 --> 482.36
right

479.099 --> 482.36
hey steamy Traveler

484.259 --> 490.5
43 Jesus

488.039 --> 494.78
man that's hot

490.5 --> 494.78
I hope you got your fluids at the ready

494.88 --> 500.58
and maybe like a good

497.639 --> 503.40000000000003
parasol or a hat

500.58 --> 506.34
like a Patty hat

503.4 --> 509.099
because that's that dude I did not

506.34 --> 510.419
like I wouldn't go outside in 43 without

509.099 --> 514.0989999999999
a hat

510.419 --> 514.0989999999999
that's just unbearable man

516.719 --> 521.5390000000001
right anyway good luck with that series

522.779 --> 527.76
of course you're probably gonna have

524.459 --> 530.2199999999999
like air conditioning and all that which

527.76 --> 533.1
usually is kind of necessary in those

530.22 --> 534.5400000000001
regions to survive the summer I don't

533.1 --> 538.82
have that here

534.54 --> 538.8199999999999
but I mean it's not gonna get 43 degrees

539.16 --> 542.12
thank God

542.58 --> 548.279
although we'd still have a lot of water

545.82 --> 551.1600000000001
to deal with that

548.279 --> 553.14
but yeah nobody wants it when sorority

551.16 --> 555.0
three that's when birds start falling

553.14 --> 559.3389999999999
dead out of the air and [ __ ] not

555.0 --> 559.339
pleasant not not a fun thing

560.64 --> 563.24
ah

564.54 --> 569.959
God central air conditioning alrighty

566.7 --> 569.9590000000001
then good for you

571.32 --> 574.1
raining

574.92 --> 577.88
God's country

578.04 --> 582.42
you mean England

580.92 --> 584.0899999999999
moxie

582.42 --> 587.1999999999999
huh

584.09 --> 587.2
[Music]

591.839 --> 597.2
still waiting for day three what are you

594.24 --> 597.2
talking about tarot

599.88 --> 602.8389999999999
whales right

610.68 --> 614.2399999999999
your Welsh moxie

614.7 --> 619.08
sounds a bit weird maybe but that would

616.74 --> 621.0600000000001
explain a couple of things

619.08 --> 623.399
about your character

621.06 --> 625.4399999999999
that are very Elusive and I I don't even

623.399 --> 626.94
have the capability of explaining that

625.44 --> 629.5400000000001
exactly but there is something about

626.94 --> 629.5400000000001
whales

630.839 --> 634.82
yeah you're a Welsh fella I thought so

636.36 --> 640.279
I might get back to that in the future

641.88 --> 644.72
uh

647.1 --> 650.899
69 fair I don't

652.5 --> 660.56
I don't know how much that is

655.68 --> 660.56
Alaric we deal in Celsius here

670.32 --> 676.44
oh Adam uh okay well since Adam seems to

674.22 --> 679.2
immediately know what tarot is talking

676.44 --> 681.5400000000001
about I take it it's yeah test match

679.2 --> 683.519
it's freaking Cricket isn't it

681.54 --> 685.8
you're talking it's you're secretly

683.519 --> 689.76
trying to like

685.8 --> 693.18
the secret society talk that nobody pays

689.76 --> 697.04
attention to in my chat about cricket

693.18 --> 697.04
it's a secret Cricket Society

697.49 --> 701.94
[Music]

699.899 --> 703.8
by the way I do like crickets there's

701.94 --> 705.72
been crickets walking

703.8 --> 707.579
all over the place and at night there

705.72 --> 710.48
has been crickets outside I love the

707.579 --> 710.4799999999999
sound of crickets

710.88 --> 716.82
in the summer it's great to have them

714.72 --> 719.48
it's funny how they like they basically

716.82 --> 719.48
just walking

752.66 --> 758.9399999999999
funny how the mic just subtly goes on

755.339 --> 761.22
mute without me even touching anything

758.94 --> 764.899
weird

761.22 --> 764.899
thanks for spotting that quickly

775.74 --> 781.38
I should have like the actual sound bar

779.04 --> 783.12
going back and forth in view at all

781.38 --> 785.399
times

783.12 --> 787.38
yeah this is the way to do that

785.399 --> 788.94
make sure that not not anything else is

787.38 --> 791.279
sitting in front of it so that I can

788.94 --> 794.12
just immediately see when the sun the

791.279 --> 794.12
sound isn't working

795.0 --> 799.32
sometimes I wish I'd had like a

796.86 --> 800.94
specialized overview page that could

799.32 --> 803.779
just lend

800.94 --> 803.7790000000001
pieces

804.36 --> 809.88
of other programs

807.72 --> 811.62
so that you don't have to maneuver all

809.88 --> 812.639
these boxes around in a very specific

811.62 --> 815.1
way

812.639 --> 818.339
but I mean it's doable still right

815.1 --> 821.22
anyway hey LSG good to see you

818.339 --> 822.839
Czar COG

821.22 --> 826.44
okay

822.839 --> 830.6600000000001
are all these new people coming from

826.44 --> 830.6600000000001
now what national team

832.019 --> 834.68
what

837.959 --> 846.6199999999999
curved surface well

840.779 --> 846.62
I mean go there are some golf courses

878.899 --> 884.839
the hell's going on here just stop

882.18 --> 884.8389999999999
[ __ ] around

896.519 --> 900.12
man

897.899 --> 902.1
maybe my mic is just getting old I mean

900.12 --> 904.94
I've been using this thing for like half

902.1 --> 904.94
a decade now

909.0 --> 912.42
it might be time to like try to get a

911.399 --> 915.54
new one

912.42 --> 918.54
because it has like a wire connection

915.54 --> 921.7199999999999
issues like if you maneuver it around

918.54 --> 923.9399999999999
it's like it disconnects and [ __ ] so I I

921.72 --> 925.019
might just need a new microphone at some

923.94 --> 928.94
point

925.019 --> 928.94
anyway hello dank good to see you

931.199 --> 936.66
it cracked before it quit yeah it's the

934.199 --> 940.8599999999999
wire connection issue and suddenly it

936.66 --> 943.399
just like it's just like oh connection

940.86 --> 943.399
to

943.56 --> 948.0
it just happens sometimes

945.98 --> 951.72
[Music]

948.0 --> 954.3
and then whole period it works perfectly

951.72 --> 957.139
for weeks and then suddenly again it's

954.3 --> 959.8199999999999
like I'm handicapped now

957.139 --> 962.639
I can't get it straight disconnect

959.82 --> 964.44
disconnect

962.639 --> 966.24
and then suddenly it's like oh it's all

964.44 --> 969.0
perfectly fine the same with my keyboard

966.24 --> 973.26
it's it's weird man

969.0 --> 976.86
like my keyboard is [ __ ] old

973.26 --> 978.66
and I mean old old

976.86 --> 981.779
as in

978.66 --> 984.6
30 years old

981.779 --> 988.86
and it still works but it has like

984.6 --> 990.12
elderly issues and certain keys to get a

988.86 --> 992.279
little rough

990.12 --> 994.32
or they they you have to like really

992.279 --> 996.54
push him but then they they deliver

994.32 --> 998.279
twice

996.54 --> 1000.5
it's like they don't deliver or they

998.279 --> 1002.42
deliver twice very annoying that that

1000.5 --> 1005.06
happens

1002.42 --> 1006.92
but it only happens in certain types of

1005.06 --> 1008.899
periods where suddenly my keyboard's

1006.92 --> 1011.959
just [ __ ] up and I end up basically

1008.899 --> 1014.92
bashing it in the face it's like bang

1011.959 --> 1018.56
you [ __ ] keyboard

1014.92 --> 1022.399
but other periods it's like I forget

1018.56 --> 1024.559
that it is even having issues

1022.399 --> 1029.059
it's like no it's just working perfectly

1024.559 --> 1033.3799999999999
I I I don't get it sometimes I think it

1029.059 --> 1036.02
really has to do even more with like

1033.38 --> 1038.179
like the air pressure and the

1036.02 --> 1040.339
temperature and the the moist crater

1038.179 --> 1043.2800000000002
something that the combination of those

1040.339 --> 1045.339
things just have different influences on

1043.28 --> 1048.02
the overall material within the design

1045.339 --> 1051.1399999999999
that then like

1048.02 --> 1054.1
make certain things expand or contract

1051.14 --> 1057.3200000000002
in a way that it's just like

1054.1 --> 1059.0
now everything is not really working I

1057.32 --> 1061.1599999999999
think something like that is happening

1059.0 --> 1063.86
because

1061.16 --> 1067.22
it really just

1063.86 --> 1069.02
suddenly comes and then suddenly goes

1067.22 --> 1071.1200000000001
it's like one day you'll be having

1069.02 --> 1073.039
issues all the time it drives you nuts

1071.12 --> 1075.7399999999998
like continually every time you try to

1073.039 --> 1077.96
type something it goes wrong

1075.74 --> 1079.88
and then the next day you wake up and

1077.96 --> 1081.44
it's like you forget all about it and it

1079.88 --> 1083.48
just works perfectly and you forgot that

1081.44 --> 1086.0
it even happened it's it's really

1083.48 --> 1089.32
bizarre but that's my life all the time

1086.0 --> 1089.32
with like everything

1090.5 --> 1092.919
anyway

1093.44 --> 1098.059
how many generations

1096.26 --> 1100.64
uh

1098.059 --> 1102.5
my grandfather

1100.64 --> 1106.22
from my dad's side

1102.5 --> 1108.62
he lived in Indonesia

1106.22 --> 1110.299
I think he was the one that actually

1108.62 --> 1114.1
migrated

1110.299 --> 1114.1
was it or was it his dad

1117.08 --> 1121.52
no no no no no my yeah my grandfather

1119.96 --> 1126.6200000000001
migrated

1121.52 --> 1129.16
he was already like half Indonesian

1126.62 --> 1129.1599999999999
like

1130.58 --> 1136.46
he was already hybridized

1133.1 --> 1138.86
anyway like my ancestors are like

1136.46 --> 1141.24
combining all over the place it's really

1138.86 --> 1144.9699999999998
bizarre

1141.24 --> 1144.97
[Music]

1145.64 --> 1152.44
but yeah third generation

1148.76 --> 1152.44
I'm third generation

1153.98 --> 1157.539
very integrated though

1162.559 --> 1167.36
like the rest of all my dad's family on

1164.96 --> 1171.16
that side they're all really adapted

1167.36 --> 1171.1599999999999
they are very Dutch

1171.5 --> 1176.24
but I think that in general that's

1173.72 --> 1178.4
something about Indonesians that come

1176.24 --> 1181.34
over to the Netherlands originally even

1178.4 --> 1183.679
that they like really become Dutch

1181.34 --> 1185.78
sometimes even more Dutch than the Dutch

1183.679 --> 1188.48
that's like a thing

1185.78 --> 1189.98
there was this also this

1188.48 --> 1193.52
thing I don't know if he's still around

1189.98 --> 1195.5
but this famous Indonesian Dutch

1193.52 --> 1197.539
pianist

1195.5 --> 1200.78
and it's kind of catchy I don't like his

1197.539 --> 1203.96
style really but he is pretty crafty

1200.78 --> 1206.24
and he's like more Dutch than any that

1203.96 --> 1208.46
Dutch person ever they talk like high

1206.24 --> 1210.98
Dutch like they're like Colonial Dutch

1208.46 --> 1213.26
almost it's crazy but they just do that

1210.98 --> 1215.1200000000001
it's an Indonesian thing

1213.26 --> 1217.52
I think that I have

1215.12 --> 1219.32
traits of that too because I am kind of

1217.52 --> 1221.96
like

1219.32 --> 1225.26
I just have this like overwhelming sense

1221.96 --> 1227.3600000000001
of like Dutch identity in a way but I it

1225.26 --> 1229.7
doesn't seem to be shared by the actual

1227.36 --> 1231.3799999999999
Dutch people mostly that's the crazy

1229.7 --> 1234.14
thing

1231.38 --> 1236.419
so I think it's like an Indonesian thing

1234.14 --> 1239.6000000000001
that they just have some kind of weird

1236.419 --> 1242.96
overwhelming sense of nationality

1239.6 --> 1245.559
whatever that nationality may be

1242.96 --> 1245.559
it's weird

1246.2 --> 1251.96
we be soon yeah that could be the guy

1249.14 --> 1253.8200000000002
yeah Supreme knowing well you looked it

1251.96 --> 1256.1000000000001
up

1253.82 --> 1258.74
yeah but that name sounds familiar but

1256.1 --> 1261.1999999999998
that's the guy these like when he talks

1258.74 --> 1263.84
on camera like he's like a colonialist

1261.2 --> 1266.24
high Dutch it's it's really weird

1263.84 --> 1269.799
because he really they talk more Dutch

1266.24 --> 1269.799
than our politicians even do

1270.26 --> 1276.16
it's funny yeah they are yeah

1272.66 --> 1276.16
I mean that guy's a cool guy

1276.44 --> 1282.26
a bit Goofy

1279.44 --> 1285.679
it's like very mainstream in a way and I

1282.26 --> 1287.98
don't like that but I mean yeah

1285.679 --> 1291.44
it did stand out to me like how

1287.98 --> 1294.039
incredibly overly well pronounced his

1291.44 --> 1294.039
Dutch is

1294.14 --> 1298.3400000000001
or at least it was I don't know what

1296.539 --> 1302.12
he's doing these days last time I even

1298.34 --> 1304.4599999999998
took note of him is like 20 years ago

1302.12 --> 1307.36
like through the television which I

1304.46 --> 1307.3600000000001
don't watch I haven't

1308.78 --> 1314.299
last time I actively watched television

1311.299 --> 1316.4
was like with my ex 10 years ago

1314.299 --> 1320.32
and even then it was rare and it was

1316.4 --> 1320.3200000000002
usually like just the news or something

1325.64 --> 1329.9
the last time I've actually been like

1327.679 --> 1333.5
more continually dependent

1329.9 --> 1335.799
the regularly watching television was

1333.5 --> 1335.799
around

1335.9 --> 1340.7
in 2008

1338.48 --> 1342.74
but then I started to use my television

1340.7 --> 1345.0800000000002
more as a monitor

1342.74 --> 1346.28
for my computer an extra Monitor and

1345.08 --> 1348.9189999999999
then

1346.28 --> 1351.74
yeah through the in in Netflix and those

1348.919 --> 1354.5800000000002
types of things came online and and like

1351.74 --> 1354.58
a lot of movie

1355.1 --> 1360.02
on yeah through the internet and then

1357.919 --> 1361.8200000000002
like television just became completely

1360.02 --> 1365.24
pointless

1361.82 --> 1368.08
because they put on movies and shows

1365.24 --> 1368.08
that sucked anyway

1377.179 --> 1383.7800000000002
it was so silly man because I did like

1380.9 --> 1386.7800000000002
back then with even the inheritance

1383.78 --> 1389.4189999999999
money by a pretty big television

1386.78 --> 1390.76
like a lot of Philips

1389.419 --> 1394.1000000000001
was like

1390.76 --> 1397.46
adapted ambient lighting thing it was

1394.1 --> 1399.799
like oh I want a very special television

1397.46 --> 1403.059
on a very high resolution for that time

1399.799 --> 1403.059
now it's super standard

1408.5 --> 1412.0
but yeah that thing broke

1413.24 --> 1418.4
foreign

1414.76 --> 1420.46
like way too huge anyway

1418.4 --> 1423.6200000000001
but like the screen itself just

1420.46 --> 1425.3600000000001
eventually only a white screen came out

1423.62 --> 1427.3999999999999
of it

1425.36 --> 1429.559
so the electronics were just completely

1427.4 --> 1432.26
[ __ ] up

1429.559 --> 1434.539
anyway ah

1432.26 --> 1437.72
does my father speak

1434.539 --> 1440.559
Tagalog what the hell is Tagalog I never

1437.72 --> 1440.559
even heard of that word

1442.22 --> 1447.5
but no my father does not like speak

1445.1 --> 1449.78
Indonesian if that's an Indonesian

1447.5 --> 1453.32
language

1449.78 --> 1456.46
like he knows a couple of words Filipino

1453.32 --> 1456.46
no definitely not

1462.32 --> 1467.12
right but my dad my dad doesn't like

1464.539 --> 1470.5
speak Indonesian like that he

1467.12 --> 1470.5
understands it a little bit

1475.82 --> 1480.799
but I mean my dad's not talented with

1477.98 --> 1483.5
language I mean he could barely speak

1480.799 --> 1484.6399999999999
English he gets all of it but he's just

1483.5 --> 1486.679
not

1484.64 --> 1489.26
good at talking

1486.679 --> 1491.8600000000001
he has like the Dutch syndrome where

1489.26 --> 1495.26
it's like overly dutified by accident

1491.86 --> 1498.02
it's not the worst kind but it is like

1495.26 --> 1500.539
just to me very obvious that it's not

1498.02 --> 1503.78
that he's not as good at it as I am

1500.539 --> 1506.919
because I'm very good at talking English

1503.78 --> 1506.9189999999999
very very good

1512.12 --> 1515.8999999999999
I'm without a doubt the best English

1514.22 --> 1518.539
speaker

1515.9 --> 1520.2800000000002
within the entirety of my family

1518.539 --> 1523.299
all of them

1520.28 --> 1523.299
I guarantee

1524.03 --> 1527.1399999999999
[Music]

1528.74 --> 1533.08
did I just teach myself yes

1535.82 --> 1544.039
and it was in a way it was fueled

1541.9 --> 1546.44
early on

1544.039 --> 1547.82
through cartoons especially Saturday

1546.44 --> 1550.039
mornings

1547.82 --> 1553.76
cause all those cartoons were all

1550.039 --> 1557.6
English spoken or rather American spoken

1553.76 --> 1560.24
like all the early cartoons from the 80s

1557.6 --> 1562.82
and even before that and they were all

1560.24 --> 1565.1
English spoken with Dutch subtitles and

1562.82 --> 1566.24
that was like the most awesome thing

1565.1 --> 1569.1789999999999
ever

1566.24 --> 1571.64
because that made me capable of

1569.179 --> 1573.5
listening to it and then just like what

1571.64 --> 1575.419
is he saying of that

1573.5 --> 1577.4
even though the translation might have

1575.419 --> 1580.64
been sort of clumsy

1577.4 --> 1582.74
at times I don't remember if it was

1580.64 --> 1585.44
but I mean in cartoons they don't really

1582.74 --> 1587.059
say all that complicated thing

1585.44 --> 1590.539
so it doesn't really matter that much

1587.059 --> 1592.22
but it would just make me tune into the

1590.539 --> 1595.52
language thinking

1592.22 --> 1597.44
right when normally outside of that yeah

1595.52 --> 1600.1399999999999
what you'd have to like spend time with

1597.44 --> 1601.76
an English teacher

1600.14 --> 1605.7990000000002
to get to that

1601.76 --> 1605.799
and they didn't have time

1606.02 --> 1610.8799999999999
English teachers don't have time because

1607.88 --> 1613.279
they're very popular in the sense that

1610.88 --> 1616.5800000000002
they're always needed

1613.279 --> 1618.919
in the 90s especially

1616.58 --> 1621.26
because we all knew that English was

1618.919 --> 1623.419
gonna be the world language for through

1621.26 --> 1625.8799999999999
media

1623.419 --> 1628.419
so English teachers never were out of a

1625.88 --> 1628.419
job never

1632.08 --> 1639.6789999999999
Thundercats yeah that's right He-Man

1636.559 --> 1643.36
right Transformers real Transformers is

1639.679 --> 1643.3600000000001
the thing that did it for me mostly

1644.539 --> 1650.9
that was definitely my favorite all-time

1647.179 --> 1650.9
favorite cartoon series

1653.779 --> 1659.179
generation one exclusively as soon as

1657.02 --> 1662.059
they went CGI with beast wars and all

1659.179 --> 1665.9
that I immediately like [ __ ] this like

1662.059 --> 1668.779
you're literally like hybridizing the

1665.9 --> 1671.9
style and the freaking story style like

1668.779 --> 1674.059
no get out of here apparently it had a

1671.9 --> 1676.76
really interesting personal development

1674.059 --> 1679.76
structure and all that but I don't give

1676.76 --> 1683.14
a [ __ ] because

1679.76 --> 1687.02
they broke a really

1683.14 --> 1689.0800000000002
refined mystical story of G1 which yeah

1687.02 --> 1692.4189999999999
they acted [ __ ] a lot of the time

1689.08 --> 1694.52
especially the first season

1692.419 --> 1697.0590000000002
it's kind of like the Star Trek effect

1694.52 --> 1700.34
it's just a bunch of episodes the

1697.059 --> 1703.279
episode per episode and it gets kind of

1700.34 --> 1708.32
stupid and clunky and inconsistent

1703.279 --> 1711.44
but there was this this feel to it and

1708.32 --> 1713.84
that developed I mean there

1711.44 --> 1715.7
it's weird to say but it almost had like

1713.84 --> 1718.9399999999998
a Babylon five like effect although

1715.7 --> 1722.24
Babylon 5K later of course but that one

1718.94 --> 1723.919
five is such a developing story all the

1722.24 --> 1725.72
time and the characters really go

1723.919 --> 1727.88
through an age

1725.72 --> 1730.52
of development

1727.88 --> 1733.64
and Transformers despite it being a kids

1730.52 --> 1735.62
cartoon kinda had that too

1733.64 --> 1739.159
and it's almost like

1735.62 --> 1741.9189999999999
just the the creators just added that

1739.159 --> 1744.3200000000002
that it wasn't even like oh that's the

1741.919 --> 1745.46
thing about it no it's just they added

1744.32 --> 1748.279
it and

1745.46 --> 1750.919
it yeah it made it really interesting

1748.279 --> 1753.32
for me and I was just super disappointed

1750.919 --> 1755.48
that they didn't continue like why

1753.32 --> 1758.96
aren't you continuing

1755.48 --> 1761.6
in the cybertronian age it's like

1758.96 --> 1763.7
you had all the things right all these

1761.6 --> 1765.399
story points that you could continue on

1763.7 --> 1768.559
and they just

1765.399 --> 1771.32
they just like no [ __ ] it we're gonna go

1768.559 --> 1773.4189999999999
with beast wars and that pissed me off a

1771.32 --> 1775.6
lot

1773.419 --> 1778.64
so that's the point where I just stopped

1775.6 --> 1780.3799999999999
watching that

1778.64 --> 1782.659
foreign

1780.38 --> 1784.7
and it was getting too old for cartoons

1782.659 --> 1787.3400000000001
anyway I was just getting much more into

1784.7 --> 1789.2
video games at that time like

1787.34 --> 1791.059
because that was around when my team

1789.2 --> 1795.76
started

1791.059 --> 1795.76
pre-teens was all Transformer G1

1798.98 --> 1802.72
anyway sorry about talking about

1803.48 --> 1806.02
yeah

1806.179 --> 1811.8400000000001
oh peace and wealth Seeker got a lot of

1808.88 --> 1811.8400000000001
new people in my chat

1819.1 --> 1825.279
700 living languages spoken Jesus

1822.799 --> 1828.799
steamed well to be fair

1825.279 --> 1831.62
Indonesia is a pretty big country

1828.799 --> 1834.679
with a lot of different Islands

1831.62 --> 1837.1589999999999
I didn't know it was 700 that is quite

1834.679 --> 1837.159
insane

1842.179 --> 1846.98
maybe they just have a real knack for

1844.88 --> 1849.2600000000002
language

1846.98 --> 1852.08
maybe they got the 700 different

1849.26 --> 1855.279
languages just because they can because

1852.08 --> 1855.279
they're so capable

1855.38 --> 1860.0
of language development

1857.659 --> 1862.1000000000001
I never I never thought of that

1860.0 --> 1864.38
it's interesting

1862.1 --> 1866.6
makes me think that maybe like in the

1864.38 --> 1871.3400000000001
very far past Indonesia was originally

1866.6 --> 1873.6999999999998
originally like a a trades Folk

1871.34 --> 1873.6999999999998
because

1873.86 --> 1879.86
what better for a successful trades folk

1876.919 --> 1882.8600000000001
than to be Masters at language

1879.86 --> 1885.1999999999998
that's the ultimate skill to have

1882.86 --> 1888.2199999999998
so they might in the distant past have

1885.2 --> 1890.96
been some like

1888.22 --> 1893.0
tartarian Tradesmen

1890.96 --> 1895.22
trade group or something I don't know

1893.0 --> 1898.419
speculating

1895.22 --> 1898.419
they are Islanders

1898.64 --> 1901.179
anyway

1903.76 --> 1911.679
Tagalog Spanish occupation hmm

1907.58 --> 1911.6789999999999
weird I didn't know that Cleary

1913.279 --> 1918.32
flattenies

1915.5 --> 1920.12
okay now we don't need a new language we

1918.32 --> 1922.6589999999999
already got also many different

1920.12 --> 1922.6589999999999
languages

1923.0 --> 1928.159
I mean if you want language development

1925.399 --> 1929.7199999999998
then develop the languages that are

1928.159 --> 1932.0590000000002
already there

1929.72 --> 1935.179
yeah adapt

1932.059 --> 1937.039
to the new developments find the right

1935.179 --> 1939.799
words

1937.039 --> 1942.08
Infuse understanding within the language

1939.799 --> 1944.779
itself

1942.08 --> 1947.6
by adapting it

1944.779 --> 1949.52
modern development and understanding

1947.6 --> 1951.4499999999998
I mean I try to do that all the time

1949.52 --> 1955.179
it's called wordcraft

1951.45 --> 1960.82
[Music]

1955.179 --> 1960.8200000000002
speak Tagalog in the Philippines okay

1962.48 --> 1965.5
I've never heard of it

1966.559 --> 1972.08
I mean my ancestors might have been from

1969.2 --> 1973.82
Indonesia but I I really know very

1972.08 --> 1974.84
little about it and I've never had like

1973.82 --> 1977.6589999999999
this

1974.84 --> 1979.6999999999998
like this pulling urge that's like you

1977.659 --> 1982.1000000000001
really need to know everything about it

1979.7 --> 1984.2
I never had that

1982.1 --> 1986.4189999999999
I have this interesting good feeling

1984.2 --> 1988.76
about it but it's like I just feels like

1986.419 --> 1991.8990000000001
that's not my task it's not my task to

1988.76 --> 1991.899
focus on that region

1992.659 --> 1998.72
but maybe it will maybe it will in the

1995.419 --> 2002.2
future right my attention focus can

1998.72 --> 2005.88
shift maybe at some point I'm like

2002.2 --> 2005.88
just kind of done with

2006.58 --> 2012.9399999999998
with Europe

2008.38 --> 2015.279
and England and America for reasons

2012.94 --> 2017.74
like because all of this [ __ ] is finally

2015.279 --> 2018.519
done with like that we're finally out of

2017.74 --> 2021.039
this

2018.519 --> 2022.8990000000001
psychological warfare situation that

2021.039 --> 2025.24
would make me like oh my God that can

2022.899 --> 2027.2199999999998
finally let it go for a bit and then

2025.24 --> 2029.5
maybe I'd focus on Indonesia I don't

2027.22 --> 2031.3600000000001
know but I mean who would know at this

2029.5 --> 2033.88
point we're all still in the middle of

2031.36 --> 2036.399
this battle and can only fantasize about

2033.88 --> 2037.8400000000001
what it would be or what we would be

2036.399 --> 2041.08
like

2037.84 --> 2042.399
after this would all be over all this

2041.08 --> 2043.779
crazy [ __ ]

2042.399 --> 2046.7199999999998
this

2043.779 --> 2048.58
seeming Armageddon because there's no

2046.72 --> 2050.7400000000002
absolute evidence there is in Armageddon

2048.58 --> 2053.22
technically it wouldn't even be possible

2050.74 --> 2053.22
I mean

2053.919 --> 2059.58
we don't have the ability to destroy the

2057.399 --> 2059.58
world

2061.72 --> 2067.48
we can only ruin it

2064.24 --> 2069.6389999999997
and thereby ruin it for ourselves

2067.48 --> 2073.179
but even if we then end up destroying

2069.639 --> 2076.3
ourselves and ruining the place

2073.179 --> 2080.08
then after we're gone that ruination

2076.3 --> 2082.659
will be basically undone by Nature it

2080.08 --> 2085.06
will guaranteed

2082.659 --> 2087.28
so but we can't destroy the world so

2085.06 --> 2088.96
it's not an Armageddon like that like we

2087.28 --> 2091.8990000000003
don't have to fear

2088.96 --> 2094.2400000000002
the end of the world because of doing of

2091.899 --> 2095.3199999999997
mankind because we are not capable of

2094.24 --> 2096.58
doing it

2095.32 --> 2098.8
like

2096.58 --> 2102.46
and there seems to be forces out there

2098.8 --> 2105.3390000000004
that literally make effort to try

2102.46 --> 2107.5
and that makes me think again about the

2105.339 --> 2109.66
true nature of the darkness

2107.5 --> 2112.42
the spirit of the darkness the spirit of

2109.66 --> 2115.06
Satan if you will like why is it doing

2112.42 --> 2118.06
what it's doing whether that is real or

2115.06 --> 2120.7
not it seems to be like it just wants

2118.06 --> 2124.06
all things to end

2120.7 --> 2128.14
so that it can move on

2124.06 --> 2130.599
like it's cursed to dwell as a ghost

2128.14 --> 2133.06
in the earth realm never to see Heaven

2130.599 --> 2136.119
never to see the Beyond

2133.06 --> 2138.16
to be obsessed with the Earthly

2136.119 --> 2141.339
well the only way to

2138.16 --> 2143.02
to make that stop is by destroying on

2141.339 --> 2145.2999999999997
everything

2143.02 --> 2147.16
like if all the spirits stop if

2145.3 --> 2149.7400000000002
everybody stops reincarnating everybody

2147.16 --> 2151.2999999999997
just moves on it's like say goodbye to

2149.74 --> 2154.1189999999997
the Earth

2151.3 --> 2156.94
this in spirit form in the afterlife

2154.119 --> 2160.2400000000002
like there's nobody left

2156.94 --> 2162.2200000000003
that's like the task of the devil to

2160.24 --> 2164.56
make it all stop so that it could

2162.22 --> 2168.8799999999997
finally move on or that it would have

2164.56 --> 2172.72
peace at least right I mean people that

2168.88 --> 2174.52
die at least allegedly that's what most

2172.72 --> 2176.859
believe is that there is an afterlife

2174.52 --> 2179.2599999999998
that they move on

2176.859 --> 2182.44
and then within the biblical

2179.26 --> 2186.3
type beliefs there is the devil and it

2182.44 --> 2186.3
can't move on it's cursed to the Earth

2187.839 --> 2193.18
so yeah it either in the dark side wants

2191.92 --> 2196.1800000000003
peace

2193.18 --> 2198.64
by having no more life around so that it

2196.18 --> 2200.14
can finally sit in peace without

2198.64 --> 2202.06
disturbance

2200.14 --> 2203.0789999999997
it basically to turn the Earth in an

2202.06 --> 2205.119
abyss

2203.079 --> 2206.02
to have absolute silence it's either

2205.119 --> 2209.079
that

2206.02 --> 2211.3
or it's like the condition to move on I

2209.079 --> 2213.82
mean maybe the deal would have been a

2211.3 --> 2217.119
bit like this that these angels that

2213.82 --> 2220.599
rebelled that Lucifer rebelled was cast

2217.119 --> 2223.2400000000002
down to earth in spirit

2220.599 --> 2224.32
like with this body maybe but also in

2223.24 --> 2227.859
spirit

2224.32 --> 2229.3590000000004
like designated to not to be designated

2227.859 --> 2233.64
to the Earth

2229.359 --> 2233.64
so that his Spirit would dwell there

2233.98 --> 2239.14
and that

2236.44 --> 2242.14
the condition was like yeah you're

2239.14 --> 2243.94
because of your decisions this is like

2242.14 --> 2246.7599999999998
would be like a god judgment because of

2243.94 --> 2248.859
your decision to do this you are not

2246.76 --> 2250.78
because you care so much about this

2248.859 --> 2253.06
Earth

2250.78 --> 2255.28
and wish to meddle with the design you

2253.06 --> 2258.94
are now designated to meddle with the

2255.28 --> 2262.7200000000003
design until the end of times

2258.94 --> 2266.44
it's like you can only be released

2262.72 --> 2270.52
if the world is ended

2266.44 --> 2273.52
but then God would be able to reserve

2270.52 --> 2277.8
basically hold back saying like and you

2273.52 --> 2277.8
can't end it only I can end it

2278.14 --> 2284.98
so that Lucifer Satan would have the

2281.619 --> 2287.26
delusion of oh I'm here to end it the

2284.98 --> 2288.94
only way to get out of this realm is to

2287.26 --> 2290.98
end it

2288.94 --> 2293.5
even though it's not capable of doing

2290.98 --> 2296.32
that it will be obsessed with it and

2293.5 --> 2298.54
thus through other people make them

2296.32 --> 2300.88
obsessed with this megalomaniacal idea

2298.54 --> 2304.5
that they can destroy the world

2300.88 --> 2304.5
but it's all an illusion

2304.839 --> 2313.839
because we can't and so through people

2309.119 --> 2316.0
Lucifer Satan can't either

2313.839 --> 2318.52
but it can

2316.0 --> 2320.32
spread the belief and the delusion and

2318.52 --> 2324.78
the megalomania

2320.32 --> 2324.78
about being able to do it

2327.22 --> 2333.04
and at best ruin it for the humans

2331.96 --> 2335.14
right

2333.04 --> 2337.839
but humans will then

2335.14 --> 2341.56
overall even by the is influence of

2337.839 --> 2344.92
Satan eventually be able to destroy

2341.56 --> 2347.619
themselves and each other

2344.92 --> 2350.079
and not the Earth

2347.619 --> 2352.48
I mean you could ruin the surface for it

2350.079 --> 2354.76
like kill a lot of Life poison the place

2352.48 --> 2358.839
and then that would influence Mankind

2354.76 --> 2361.42
and then make them die but over time

2358.839 --> 2363.099
that damage will be undone by Nature

2361.42 --> 2366.28
through God's design

2363.099 --> 2368.5
that can't destroy the Earth we can

2366.28 --> 2370.48
we can ruin a lot but you can't destroy

2368.5 --> 2373.839
it

2370.48 --> 2376.0
right anyway this is type of ethereal

2373.839 --> 2378.339
thinking that goes through be a lot and

2376.0 --> 2381.839
it was able to just explain it in detail

2378.339 --> 2381.839
hope you appreciated it

2382.119 --> 2386.349
ah

2383.17 --> 2386.349
[Music]

2387.52 --> 2390.24
what

2412.3 --> 2417.3390000000004
you were high school did your school

2414.339 --> 2420.0
have a local rival yeah

2417.339 --> 2420.0
we did

2420.4 --> 2426.88
there was a weird rivalry between our

2423.7 --> 2429.5989999999997
school and another school

2426.88 --> 2434.7000000000003
Middle School talking about not

2429.599 --> 2434.7000000000003
pre-teens type thing but yeah

2445.119 --> 2449.6800000000003
but I mean most of our school wasn't

2447.46 --> 2452.32
even into sports that much there was a

2449.68 --> 2454.5989999999997
sports group but I mean the school that

2452.32 --> 2458.02
I went to it was really a bunch of nerds

2454.599 --> 2461.2000000000003
most of it I mean like everybody

2458.02 --> 2464.4
it's like you were at least a half nerd

2461.2 --> 2464.3999999999996
if you were in that school

2464.98 --> 2470.5
although there were some guys that were

2467.14 --> 2473.46
just like kind of weird

2470.5 --> 2473.46
dumb-ish people

2473.56 --> 2477.4
but those eventually like just dropped

2475.78 --> 2478.9
out

2477.4 --> 2481.5
because they were just goofing around

2478.9 --> 2481.5
too much

2483.06 --> 2487.66
and I mean I was goofing around like

2485.619 --> 2490.32
playing Magic the Gathering all the

2487.66 --> 2490.3199999999997
freaking time

2490.96 --> 2494.7400000000002
like even during class just skipping

2493.119 --> 2496.78
class just because I wanted to keep

2494.74 --> 2500.7599999999998
playing but it doesn't matter because

2496.78 --> 2500.76
I'd still I still made it

2501.339 --> 2505.32
in ways I was kind of bored

2508.54 --> 2512.68
because there was a lot of things that I

2510.46 --> 2514.7200000000003
wanted to learn

2512.68 --> 2516.7599999999998
but it wasn't there

2514.72 --> 2518.6189999999997
so it was frustrated it's like yeah you

2516.76 --> 2521.32
just want me to keep learning this stuff

2518.619 --> 2524.2000000000003
but I'm done with that stuff like

2521.32 --> 2527.8590000000004
I know enough all this other detail

2524.2 --> 2529.72
garbage is useless to know like I knew

2527.859 --> 2532.72
that I could feel it

2529.72 --> 2534.8799999999997
and so it's like yeah I

2532.72 --> 2537.0989999999997
I don't really care about I want to know

2534.88 --> 2541.7200000000003
the more complex stuff behind it I want

2537.099 --> 2544.6800000000003
to know about the actual developments

2541.72 --> 2544.68
but yeah

2544.96 --> 2550.0
that's not how School works even in that

2547.3 --> 2552.099
nerdy school that I went to

2550.0 --> 2555.3
still learned a lot though

2552.099 --> 2555.3
even from other people

2556.0 --> 2560.98
but yeah because of that I was kind of

2558.52 --> 2563.94
like distracting myself a lot with

2560.98 --> 2563.94
playing games

2564.78 --> 2571.619
smoking cannabis too getting high and

2568.42 --> 2571.619
talking endlessly

2571.72 --> 2575.22
outside of school of course

2578.74 --> 2586.4399999999996
Flat Earth Club it might no but I did

2582.04 --> 2586.44
meet meet the Jesuit guy at my school

2589.24 --> 2592.7999999999997
you couldn't bring that up

2598.359 --> 2602.0789999999997
I mean seriously in that school there

2600.64 --> 2604.1189999999997
were people

2602.079 --> 2606.04
and I think they were literally like

2604.119 --> 2609.7200000000003
Jesuit kids

2606.04 --> 2612.64
I call him the Jesuit guy not as a cute

2609.72 --> 2615.22
mysterious nickname it it's because he

2612.64 --> 2618.339
literally was a Jesuit yeah at [ __ ]

2615.22 --> 2620.4399999999996
14. I tried to make sense of it

2618.339 --> 2623.14
it doesn't make sense to me I barely

2620.44 --> 2626.5
even understood what Jesuits were

2623.14 --> 2629.4
at that time I was 17 he was freaking

2626.5 --> 2629.4
14.

2630.76 --> 2634.119
I don't understand oh that's all

2632.98 --> 2636.46
possible

2634.119 --> 2638.079
I don't want to know how that's all

2636.46 --> 2638.859
about I don't want to know what he went

2638.079 --> 2640.98
through

2638.859 --> 2644.619
to get to that point

2640.98 --> 2646.839
at that age but uh

2644.619 --> 2649.42
yeah if you just start talking about

2646.839 --> 2653.38
Flat Earth like in class

2649.42 --> 2656.92
people would literally verbally assault

2653.38 --> 2660.339
you and then after class is over come

2656.92 --> 2663.64
and haunt you like stalk you and

2660.339 --> 2665.2599999999998
complain to like the principle that

2663.64 --> 2668.44
you're harassing them or that you're

2665.26 --> 2672.0400000000004
anti-semitic or something serious

2668.44 --> 2673.599
yeah it was very [ __ ] dangerous to

2672.04 --> 2675.64
bring up Flat Earth

2673.599 --> 2678.76
very dangerous

2675.64 --> 2680.3799999999997
he had to do it in private

2678.76 --> 2684.0600000000004
one on one

2680.38 --> 2684.06
when nobody was listening

2699.94 --> 2705.28
so no no flat Earth Club no friendly

2703.54 --> 2707.92
Flat Earth Club

2705.28 --> 2710.7000000000003
you would literally like get gang

2707.92 --> 2714.2400000000002
stalked and attacked if you did that

2710.7 --> 2714.24
steamy traveler yeah

2716.02 --> 2719.4
yeah that's my teens

2722.8 --> 2727.3590000000004
everybody was [ __ ] scared of talking

2725.56 --> 2729.04
about Flat Earth because of that [ __ ]

2727.359 --> 2731.68
because of these people

2729.04 --> 2732.88
like even in the Waldorf School before

2731.68 --> 2735.46
that

2732.88 --> 2738.4
people kind of some people just knew

2735.46 --> 2742.78
about Flat Earth but they were terrified

2738.4 --> 2744.7000000000003
and I mean shakingly terrified if it was

2742.78 --> 2748.9
brought up in public

2744.7 --> 2752.9199999999996
like in a not one-on-one situation they

2748.9 --> 2755.02
would Shake when it was brought up in

2752.92 --> 2756.7000000000003
fear

2755.02 --> 2760.119
so I bet that a whole bunch of those

2756.7 --> 2762.5789999999997
guys definitely faced Jesuits as well

2760.119 --> 2766.079
probably got very seriously threatened

2762.579 --> 2766.079
because that's what Jesuits do

2768.76 --> 2773.92
threaten you severely

2771.579 --> 2776.26
if you bring up no no subjects that

2773.92 --> 2778.2400000000002
nobody knows about

2776.26 --> 2780.3390000000004
that's my experience I don't know what

2778.24 --> 2783.4599999999996
they do now that was what happened to me

2780.339 --> 2786.18
when I was a teen

2783.46 --> 2786.18
and pretty

2789.94 --> 2794.68
I was into Flat Earth before my teams

2792.04 --> 2798.04
dude I how many times do I have to tell

2794.68 --> 2800.98
this story I got faced with flat earth

2798.04 --> 2803.619
like five times throughout my life

2800.98 --> 2806.92
before 2015.

2803.619 --> 2809.619
and every time I I deal with it it was

2806.92 --> 2811.42
[ __ ] hell it was people literally

2809.619 --> 2814.48
threatening you like a freaking

2811.42 --> 2816.94
nightmare movie yeah

2814.48 --> 2819.46
no wonder I kept forgetting about it

2816.94 --> 2822.7000000000003
because if I just forget about it and

2819.46 --> 2825.28
not talk about it they immediately leave

2822.7 --> 2826.72
you alone they immediately would stop

2825.28 --> 2829.0600000000004
threatening you

2826.72 --> 2831.22
if they could see that you weren't

2829.06 --> 2833.68
secretly keeping it inside but just

2831.22 --> 2837.2799999999997
literally forgot about it they could see

2833.68 --> 2841.18
it they could see if you were holding it

2837.28 --> 2843.52
in okay these people are semi telepathic

2841.18 --> 2847.02
kind of like I am that's why I thought

2843.52 --> 2847.02
it was one of them at some point

2851.38 --> 2856.839
yeah five times huh yeah that's right

2854.26 --> 2858.6400000000003
first time was like when I was five or

2856.839 --> 2861.4
six

2858.64 --> 2863.859
and this happened when I was 12. it

2861.4 --> 2867.339
happened when it was 17 it happened when

2863.859 --> 2870.339
it was freaking 23 and it happened when

2867.339 --> 2870.339
2011.

2870.4 --> 2876.6600000000003
there you go I can literally name the

2873.64 --> 2876.66
[ __ ] years

2879.819 --> 2886.8
although it's a bit but it's roughly

2882.819 --> 2886.8
around that in yeah

2886.9 --> 2891.28
so yeah Flat Earth all over my life

2889.119 --> 2893.6800000000003
immediately forgetting it though because

2891.28 --> 2895.3590000000004
the terror the terror that would

2893.68 --> 2898.1189999999997
surround me

2895.359 --> 2899.859
as soon as I got into it and all I

2898.119 --> 2903.0
wanted was to just to know more I just

2899.859 --> 2903.0
wanted to understand more

2903.52 --> 2907.56
but I couldn't deal with the threats

2908.44 --> 2913.839
and people literally just vowing to

2911.619 --> 2916.599
ensure that you'd never get a job in

2913.839 --> 2919.0
your life just for bringing that up

2916.599 --> 2921.04
I mean dude you have no idea how many

2919.0 --> 2924.46
[ __ ] nightmares I had to deal with in

2921.04 --> 2927.23
my life because of everything because of

2924.46 --> 2931.739
these people because of this subject

2927.23 --> 2931.739
[Music]

2955.3 --> 2958.54
so what happened with the Dutch

2956.8 --> 2961.6600000000003
government

2958.54 --> 2964.839
yeah well it's broken

2961.66 --> 2966.7
so that's good that's a good start but I

2964.839 --> 2969.46
mean it's not the end

2966.7 --> 2973.1189999999997
it never is it's not until the guy is

2969.46 --> 2975.52
literally Behind Bars and persecuted

2973.119 --> 2978.2200000000003
and it's going to take some time but

2975.52 --> 2981.839
yeah the cabinet fell

2978.22 --> 2984.2799999999997
and now he's gonna root

2981.839 --> 2986.02
you always call him Ruta because you're

2984.28 --> 2987.579
American idiots and you can't pronounce

2986.02 --> 2989.859
Dutch properly

2987.579 --> 2993.28
if you're life dependent on it

2989.859 --> 2995.74
but yeah is extremely smart psychopath

2993.28 --> 2998.8190000000004
and he will

2995.74 --> 3002.0989999999997
definitely be capable of

2998.819 --> 3004.98
maneuvering things around

3002.099 --> 3008.04
within the political groups in order to

3004.98 --> 3010.68
get a new thing going

3008.04 --> 3012.119
I mean this would be the like the fourth

3010.68 --> 3015.1189999999997
time

3012.119 --> 3017.2200000000003
he continually does that he's very good

3015.119 --> 3019.5
at just resetting whatever's happening

3017.22 --> 3020.52
because he's so good at setting up new

3019.5 --> 3022.68
things

3020.52 --> 3025.92
but the new things will always be the

3022.68 --> 3028.859
same old thing reformed so it's gonna

3025.92 --> 3030.9
lead to the same things

3028.859 --> 3033.7799999999997
and so some of these parties have just

3030.9 --> 3036.06
completely imploded in on themselves and

3033.78 --> 3039.0
he will just use the new parties that

3036.06 --> 3040.619
haven't imploded that badly yet to do

3039.0 --> 3043.8
the same thing over again

3040.619 --> 3045.96
so it's not over yet

3043.8 --> 3048.96
foreign

3045.96 --> 3048.96
f

3053.099 --> 3059.1600000000003
f d for for democracy

3056.52 --> 3061.859
because they really seem to be like the

3059.16 --> 3063.66
only actual opposition

3061.859 --> 3065.819
but I mean they're literally being

3063.66 --> 3067.92
talked about about banning them as a

3065.819 --> 3071.7599999999998
party because of their Nazis or

3067.92 --> 3074.579
something which is [ __ ] insane

3071.76 --> 3076.92
I mean like the entire party is getting

3074.579 --> 3079.38
a full Trump treatment I'm not even

3076.92 --> 3080.46
joking you think that Trump Got It Bad

3079.38 --> 3084.359
and [ __ ]

3080.46 --> 3088.26
well ffd gets the full Trump treatment

3084.359 --> 3090.839
for the entire political party including

3088.26 --> 3093.42
their young recruits and [ __ ] that get

3090.839 --> 3097.5589999999997
literally attacked

3093.42 --> 3099.8
by Shea W's like physically assaulted by

3097.559 --> 3099.8
them

3102.119 --> 3106.079
right

3103.44 --> 3109.079
and they basically won the previous

3106.079 --> 3111.48
election I voted on them and like all

3109.079 --> 3113.7000000000003
their votes got stolen like all of it

3111.48 --> 3115.92
like they were literally not even on the

3113.7 --> 3118.7599999999998
map not because they didn't have enough

3115.92 --> 3121.559
it was because all of it was just

3118.76 --> 3125.88
deleted yeah

3121.559 --> 3128.3390000000004
all the votes they got were deleted it

3125.88 --> 3130.339
was literally not there

3128.339 --> 3134.339
totally insane

3130.339 --> 3136.68
totally [ __ ] insane blatant

3134.339 --> 3139.7999999999997
blatant voting fraud

3136.68 --> 3141.54
blatant Justice blatant as the [ __ ] had

3139.8 --> 3144.26
happened

3141.54 --> 3144.2599999999998
in America

3145.98 --> 3150.72
in 2020.

3148.92 --> 3152.64
Blake

3150.72 --> 3154.6189999999997
but everybody was still distracted by

3152.64 --> 3157.0789999999997
the BBB party

3154.619 --> 3161.46
which has turned completely traitorous

3157.079 --> 3165.059
like they are the new cartel party they

3161.46 --> 3167.04
literally just sold out to wef

3165.059 --> 3171.0
it's like it's no now they are

3167.04 --> 3175.079
identified they have come out as another

3171.0 --> 3178.74
head of the Hydra of the cartel

3175.079 --> 3180.42
but they still have like a big scoop in

3178.74 --> 3182.9399999999996
in the government but now that the

3180.42 --> 3186.119
government has fallen

3182.94 --> 3188.88
they could just be swiped off the map

3186.119 --> 3191.7000000000003
too because of that or reform

3188.88 --> 3194.4
with other people at the head of it that

3191.7 --> 3196.2599999999998
aren't traitors to the cartel so yeah

3194.4 --> 3198.059
anything can happen a lot of things can

3196.26 --> 3200.5200000000004
happen right now it's

3198.059 --> 3203.099
it's an excite it's like the first time

3200.52 --> 3204.96
where it's kind of exciting and not just

3203.099 --> 3206.819
like yeah you know exactly what's gonna

3204.96 --> 3208.68
happen no I don't know exactly what's

3206.819 --> 3211.44
gonna happen like the

3208.68 --> 3213.66
the alchemical potential is higher right

3211.44 --> 3216.2400000000002
now and that's interesting

3213.66 --> 3220.2599999999998
a lot can happen

3216.24 --> 3224.04
and I really hope that good guys

3220.26 --> 3225.3590000000004
the the the think tanks for the farmers

3224.04 --> 3227.46
here

3225.359 --> 3231.119
that they're gonna make a move because

3227.46 --> 3233.4
you need to make a move in alchemical

3231.119 --> 3234.9
when alchemical components like that are

3233.4 --> 3236.7000000000003
floating around when that energy is

3234.9 --> 3238.38
there you need to make the move the

3236.7 --> 3243.02
enemy is going to make a move you need

3238.38 --> 3243.02
to make like Progressive moves

3243.72 --> 3247.9199999999996
in times like this

3245.819 --> 3250.98
because this is the time where you can

3247.92 --> 3252.839
actually get more grip on the situation

3250.98 --> 3255.079
if you do that but if they do nothing

3252.839 --> 3258.54
and they wait and sit back

3255.079 --> 3260.04
then they will lose again guaranteed

3258.54 --> 3262.14
they lose

3260.04 --> 3263.64
unless they make some serious moves

3262.14 --> 3267.359
right now

3263.64 --> 3269.46
like use this situation guys use it and

3267.359 --> 3271.92
yeah I'm telling you this guy that's

3269.46 --> 3274.44
just sitting in his room I know I'm not

3271.92 --> 3276.42
doing it I'm just a blabbermouth but I'm

3274.44 --> 3277.38
telling you as an oracle this is the

3276.42 --> 3279.839
time

3277.38 --> 3281.46
is this the time to make a progressive

3279.839 --> 3283.859
maneuver

3281.46 --> 3285.96
against this Beast system against the

3283.859 --> 3289.619
cartels

3285.96 --> 3291.599
I hope you had some plans

3289.619 --> 3294.3
ready for the go they'll save you some

3291.599 --> 3297.3
time give you more

3294.3 --> 3298.8590000000004
room to execute such plans because now

3297.3 --> 3301.3390000000004
is the time

3298.859 --> 3301.339
anyway

3304.44 --> 3310.619
yeah and yeah boy

3308.7 --> 3312.18
yeah there's a lot that needs to happen

3310.619 --> 3314.46
but I mean

3312.18 --> 3316.5
you can't worry about it is not the time

3314.46 --> 3318.9
to start yelling about it I mean or at

3316.5 --> 3322.079
least not for my country now is the time

3318.9 --> 3324.54
to actually get tactical at like who how

3322.079 --> 3325.6800000000003
are we gonna retake the helm on this

3324.54 --> 3327.9
thing

3325.68 --> 3330.7799999999997
to get it back under control before it's

3327.9 --> 3333.619
all gone before the entire country is no

3330.78 --> 3333.619
longer recognizable

3336.66 --> 3341.5789999999997
I mean the amount of things that are on

3339.24 --> 3344.5789999999997
the table

3341.579 --> 3346.2000000000003
that they try to force through is like

3344.579 --> 3349.8590000000004
horrific

3346.2 --> 3354.0
horrific it's unimaginable it is Way

3349.859 --> 3357.72
Beyond 1984. it is beyond it you

3354.0 --> 3359.04
understand Beyond 9084 90 84

3357.72 --> 3363.1189999999997
is like

3359.04 --> 3364.74
the training phase compared to what they

3363.119 --> 3367.7000000000003
actually want to implement here

3364.74 --> 3367.7
everywhere

3373.44 --> 3376.559
all right anyway

3374.75 --> 3378.66
[Music]

3376.559 --> 3380.8390000000004
so yeah it's exciting times in that

3378.66 --> 3380.839
sense

3394.619 --> 3396.8
thank you

3408.48 --> 3412.619
right but the tactic that has been

3410.88 --> 3413.88
happening for a while I don't know how

3412.619 --> 3416.46
long they can keep it up it's a

3413.88 --> 3419.76
desperate tactic and that is overwhelm

3416.46 --> 3422.579
the opponent while still in control

3419.76 --> 3425.1800000000003
try to get as many horrendous things

3422.579 --> 3428.76
through that will have an enormously

3425.18 --> 3429.98
demoralizing influence on the public and

3428.76 --> 3434.0400000000004
thereby

3429.98 --> 3438.2400000000002
hopefully stuttering or even halting

3434.04 --> 3441.54
the attempt to retake power back

3438.24 --> 3446.2999999999997
from these Waf agents that's their

3441.54 --> 3446.3
tactic but I mean the cabinet's Fallen

3446.339 --> 3451.38
so that means that

3448.559 --> 3453.3
this might be literally the buckling of

3451.38 --> 3455.88
that face

3453.3 --> 3459.42
and that's a good sign so

3455.88 --> 3461.819
really from all sides looking at it from

3459.42 --> 3465.059
all sides the patterns

3461.819 --> 3468.2
the bones as they're rolling out it's

3465.059 --> 3468.2000000000003
looking good right now

3469.38 --> 3473.52
it's looking good

3471.359 --> 3476.16
despite all the damage that's already

3473.52 --> 3478.74
been done pretty much

3476.16 --> 3483.2599999999998
there's a real good opportunity for

3478.74 --> 3483.2599999999998
actual durable change

3485.819 --> 3490.2799999999997
so that's my forecasting as an oracle

3494.18 --> 3500.5789999999997
Kazarian Mafia WF yeah fair enough

3497.819 --> 3504.119
Dojo you had to say it didn't you oh

3500.579 --> 3507.92
it's so important to say that oh yes

3504.119 --> 3507.92
why though I mean

3514.98 --> 3520.799
I mean by yeah you could say that iron

3519.059 --> 3523.7400000000002
26

3520.799 --> 3526.38
but really only if you say that well

3523.74 --> 3527.4599999999996
Hitler was kind of a Jew too

3526.38 --> 3528.6600000000003
yeah

3527.46 --> 3530.94
it was

3528.66 --> 3534.1189999999997
a Zionist

3530.94 --> 3538.079
right well if you say Zionist is Jew

3534.119 --> 3541.44
then w e f is you fair enough but it's

3538.079 --> 3546.42
not really jew though

3541.44 --> 3549.26
right they do not follow the Torah

3546.42 --> 3549.26
like that

3549.359 --> 3555.54
so Zionist

3551.339 --> 3557.52
would be the the better designation

3555.54 --> 3560.099
Hitler was a Zionist too and I mean

3557.52 --> 3562.319
these Waf they are freaking Nazis

3560.099 --> 3565.319
they're they're function they're

3562.319 --> 3567.7799999999997
propaganda their attitude

3565.319 --> 3571.5
they are Nazis

3567.78 --> 3574.1400000000003
so it's kind of weird to call them do

3571.5 --> 3575.819
unless you recognize that Hitler was a

3574.14 --> 3577.6189999999997
Jew and then it's like what what does it

3575.819 --> 3580.5
do well it's not somebody that following

3577.619 --> 3583.099
the Torah in that case like the actual

3580.5 --> 3583.099
religion

3583.5 --> 3588.599
like with the the small hats and the the

3586.44 --> 3591.0
curly things and the different types of

3588.599 --> 3592.6800000000003
juice like the actual religions

3591.0 --> 3594.92
right

3592.68 --> 3598.0789999999997
but it's like a Zionist it's like a

3594.92 --> 3600.1800000000003
political unit it's it's just it's not

3598.079 --> 3602.579
really a Jew anymore like what the [ __ ]

3600.18 --> 3604.5
does do people even realize what they're

3602.579 --> 3606.059
saying when they say Jew at this point I

3604.5 --> 3608.579
mean

3606.059 --> 3611.52
it would be more factually accurate to

3608.579 --> 3614.1600000000003
just call them zionists

3611.52 --> 3617.579
because that emphasizes the political

3614.16 --> 3619.319
Factor more than any religious

3617.579 --> 3622.6800000000003
background because

3619.319 --> 3625.2
those wef people they are not practicing

3622.68 --> 3630.0789999999997
Jews

3625.2 --> 3630.0789999999997
okay I don't think any of them are

3638.579 --> 3642.48
I mean I think that all of them are like

3640.74 --> 3644.64
atheists

3642.48 --> 3649.52
how does that make sense yeah

3644.64 --> 3649.52
you can't have an atheist Jew

3650.94 --> 3654.7400000000002
that doesn't make any sense you see

3655.079 --> 3660.059
so you could pretty much do it like this

3658.26 --> 3663.2990000000004
somebody says like oh you're being

3660.059 --> 3665.7000000000003
anti-semitic well then

3663.299 --> 3668.579
do you believe in God

3665.7 --> 3670.6189999999997
if they say no then just then you can

3668.579 --> 3673.079
say well then how am I anti-semitic

3670.619 --> 3678.42
because you're not a Jew

3673.079 --> 3681.8390000000004
a Jew is a person who follows a religion

3678.42 --> 3684.119
of the Bible in the Old Testament with

3681.839 --> 3685.859
God they are the follower of God if you

3684.119 --> 3688.799
don't believe God how then how can you

3685.859 --> 3691.0989999999997
be a Jew you see that doesn't make any

3688.799 --> 3691.099
sense

3691.14 --> 3696.42
then you're an atheist that's come from

3693.96 --> 3699.059
a Jewish Family perhaps

3696.42 --> 3701.52
but are you still a Jew then when you're

3699.059 --> 3706.0400000000004
an atheist no

3701.52 --> 3706.04
it's like saying like yeah I'm a

3711.24 --> 3717.4199999999996
I'm like I'm both

3713.76 --> 3721.8190000000004
a Buddhist and a Catholic

3717.42 --> 3725.099
like but those are conflicting

3721.819 --> 3728.64
beliefs there's conflicting behavioral

3725.099 --> 3731.7000000000003
codes I mean you can't be both you can

3728.64 --> 3734.52
be a weird hybridization in which you're

3731.7 --> 3736.74
like kind of eclectic you're like I'm

3734.52 --> 3739.859
just taking whatever I want I'm forming

3736.74 --> 3744.1189999999997
my own personal religion but that then

3739.859 --> 3747.48
doesn't make you literally Catholic and

3744.119 --> 3750.7200000000003
Buddhist because that makes no sense

3747.48 --> 3755.579
right and in that sense you can't be

3750.72 --> 3758.3999999999996
an atheist and a Jew that makes no sense

3755.579 --> 3760.579
they are literally in opposition to one

3758.4 --> 3760.579
another

3769.5 --> 3774.839
oh that's interesting your chatwork yeah

3771.599 --> 3777.92
yeah well those details are kind of lost

3774.839 --> 3781.14
right so be careful with

3777.92 --> 3784.02
you I mean I know it's funny to say the

3781.14 --> 3786.7799999999997
word you like that

3784.02 --> 3788.52
it's it's it's more funny than it's

3786.78 --> 3791.099
serious to me

3788.52 --> 3793.2599999999998
and I mean people can't really say that

3791.099 --> 3795.119
with all that seriousness because it

3793.26 --> 3797.7000000000003
doesn't make any logical sense to call

3795.119 --> 3799.859
them Jews

3797.7 --> 3801.72
I mean if you're gonna say it in the old

3799.859 --> 3805.859
runic

3801.72 --> 3808.74
the old Germanic Rune type way Jew then

3805.859 --> 3810.48
it's like yeah yeah because that's but

3808.74 --> 3813.0789999999997
that's not the religion though that's

3810.48 --> 3813.079
like a

3814.559 --> 3820.26
spiritual karmic designation it's a

3818.4 --> 3822.839
spiritual thing it's not the religion

3820.26 --> 3826.079
then if you're gonna call them a Jew

3822.839 --> 3830.0589999999997
by the roon standard right there's a

3826.079 --> 3830.059
there's a Jew room did you know that

3834.359 --> 3837.359
right

3835.38 --> 3839.579
it's interesting how when you look at

3837.359 --> 3841.02
that what that actually stands for I

3839.579 --> 3843.299
mean I think that a lot of people that

3841.02 --> 3845.88
call other Jews

3843.299 --> 3847.2599999999998
they're actually meaning that but

3845.88 --> 3850.6400000000003
they're just like

3847.26 --> 3850.6400000000003
not thinking of it

3853.02 --> 3856.04
it's weird

3856.74 --> 3864.54
right

3859.079 --> 3866.6400000000003
but yeah I mean wef are not Jews

3864.54 --> 3870.54
they might be zionists

3866.64 --> 3873.54
but they're like braggingly distinctly

3870.54 --> 3873.54
atheist

3873.78 --> 3878.1600000000003
right

3874.859 --> 3879.18
they're completely atheists you can't be

3878.16 --> 3882.1189999999997
a Jew

3879.18 --> 3883.98
then you can't be

3882.119 --> 3888.48
a follower

3883.98 --> 3893.42
of God of the Bible and a non-believer

3888.48 --> 3893.42
of the god of the Bible at the same time

3896.099 --> 3899.42
that makes no sense

3901.7 --> 3906.2599999999998
authoritarian fascist yeah definitely

3912.42 --> 3918.2400000000002
and they're exorbitantly arrogant

3916.5 --> 3920.24
right they're not even that that

3918.24 --> 3924.24
brutally military

3920.24 --> 3927.9199999999996
they're just so incredibly arrogant and

3924.24 --> 3927.9199999999996
patronizing everything

3942.059 --> 3947.96
you can be a Japanese and a Catholic

3944.579 --> 3947.96
yeah of course you can

3949.98 --> 3954.7400000000002
one is a nation the other is a religion

3999.119 --> 4002.78
all right but what you can't be is a

4001.339 --> 4005.66
Japanese

4002.78 --> 4008.1800000000003
Catholic shintoist

4005.66 --> 4010.16
like you can't be Catholic and shintoist

4008.18 --> 4013.64
at the same time why because those are

4010.16 --> 4016.7599999999998
religions and they're not compatible

4013.64 --> 4019.299
so if you try to hybridize them then you

4016.76 --> 4019.2990000000004
would be neither

4019.76 --> 4025.099
you're eclectic then you're you're

4022.22 --> 4029.6189999999997
making something new out of it

4025.099 --> 4029.619
but thereby alienate both communities

4030.02 --> 4034.0389999999998
or might

4032.059 --> 4036.6800000000003
alienate wealth communities because

4034.039 --> 4039.76
you're not just following their

4036.68 --> 4039.7599999999998
specific pattern

4048.02 --> 4051.2
right anyway I'm going to Chow Down on

4049.819 --> 4053.42
this

4051.2 --> 4056.0
curricula

4053.42 --> 4057.859
I hope you're this is all interesting to

4056.0 --> 4060.46
you guys I hope you're enjoying the show

4057.859 --> 4060.46
so far

4071.44 --> 4076.2200000000003
yesterday's show by the way great show I

4074.24 --> 4079.4799999999996
didn't really know what title to give it

4076.22 --> 4079.48
I just left it like that

4080.9 --> 4086.6800000000003
maybe too much annoying personal things

4083.24 --> 4086.68
that I discussed

4087.14 --> 4091.5789999999997
uh

4088.94 --> 4093.859
and then the ball busters I mean no

4091.579 --> 4095.9
Busters this evening because it was

4093.859 --> 4098.719
yesterday evening

4095.9 --> 4102.679
but that was pretty cool new development

4098.719 --> 4104.359
a new development cons or well a new old

4102.679 --> 4106.04
development that's getting refined

4104.359 --> 4108.259
basically

4106.04 --> 4110.719
about time zones and that's going to be

4108.259 --> 4113.48
interesting because it's a real it's a

4110.719 --> 4116.96
real invention it's it's a great Insight

4113.48 --> 4118.218999999999
that's now finally been fully refined

4116.96 --> 4122.14
and

4118.219 --> 4122.14
going to be even further refined

4122.239 --> 4127.58
so that it will be a permanent addition

4124.58 --> 4130.219
to the housekeeping questions

4127.58 --> 4133.04
so yeah we got a new thing that's going

4130.219 --> 4135.759
to be developing this coming weeks

4133.04 --> 4135.759
it's great

4155.259 --> 4158.44
come on

4159.02 --> 4164.719
I think the Heat's just like

4161.66 --> 4167.38
making these at least rot kind of

4164.719 --> 4167.38
quickly yeah

4168.98 --> 4172.9
even though I do keep them in a cooler

4173.42 --> 4179.5
I guess I kept them out for like an hour

4175.4 --> 4179.5
now right let's Chow Down

4201.88 --> 4207.08
man it's so hot

4204.98 --> 4209.32
I wish there was like a little bit more

4207.08 --> 4209.32
wind

4215.54 --> 4221.739
by the way look how great The Parsley is

4218.42 --> 4221.7390000000005
doing let's look at it

4222.44 --> 4228.28
I caught a whole bunch of it yesterday

4224.42 --> 4228.28
because I made a little garlic sauce

4228.5 --> 4234.02
fresh

4230.96 --> 4236.679
but I mean it's doing so great

4234.02 --> 4236.679
incredible

4243.08 --> 4248.0599999999995
and there's like all kinds of new

4245.3 --> 4251.7390000000005
branches already coming up

4248.06 --> 4251.7390000000005
so this thing is really booming

4267.199 --> 4275.178999999999
look at the second basil plant

4271.04 --> 4277.4
I mean yeah it's gone full bloom

4275.179 --> 4279.08
but I mean it's a really cute plant to

4277.4 --> 4283.0
look at so

4279.08 --> 4283.0
I'm perfectly content with that

4287.06 --> 4291.9800000000005
smells so nice I mean I just like the

4290.06 --> 4293.719
smell of Basil

4291.98 --> 4295.879999999999
just like going through it with your

4293.719 --> 4298.699
hands and you can just smell the basil

4295.88 --> 4301.219
of it so strongly

4298.699 --> 4304.36
and the yeah the flowers are cute it

4301.219 --> 4304.36
attracts the bees

4305.36 --> 4308.08
foreign

4319.6 --> 4326.4800000000005
yeah by the way I totally

4322.58 --> 4328.34
got my prediction wrong considering the

4326.48 --> 4330.379999999999
water bowl it's still there there's no

4328.34 --> 4332.179
Bird that's found it I think it's just

4330.38 --> 4333.02
too hot for the birds to even come up

4332.179 --> 4335.2390000000005
here

4333.02 --> 4337.64
or maybe they bumped into an empty water

4335.239 --> 4339.259999999999
bowl a few too many times and they just

4337.64 --> 4342.88
didn't want to risk it

4339.26 --> 4342.88
was too disappointed

4344.12 --> 4349.9
but they'll probably be be back and

4346.699 --> 4349.9
they'll figure it out soon enough

4350.6 --> 4352.6
um

4357.08 --> 4361.3
you do what with your tomato plants

4383.239 --> 4386.299999999999
um wow

4388.699 --> 4393.98
do I really want to read that iron 26

4391.58 --> 4396.5199999999995
that looks kind of

4393.98 --> 4396.5199999999995
stupid

4428.42 --> 4435.52
all right oh yeah

4432.219 --> 4435.52
I get it

4446.78 --> 4451.28
yeah fiber I mean I see it as I see I

4449.36 --> 4453.5599999999995
say it as I see it

4451.28 --> 4455.3
I mean I just had a whole segment where

4453.56 --> 4458.120000000001
I was explaining how it doesn't make any

4455.3 --> 4459.679
sense to call those people Jews and then

4458.12 --> 4462.64
you give me an article on how they're

4459.679 --> 4462.64
all Jews yeah

4463.58 --> 4470.199
that's just or not all of them but I

4466.28 --> 4470.199
just it doesn't make any sense yeah

4474.26 --> 4479.62
I mean you could just call all of them

4476.9 --> 4479.62
Catholics

4480.32 --> 4486.04
it would not be any more or less

4483.38 --> 4486.04
accurate

4489.62 --> 4495.62
what is a non-practicing you well

4493.4 --> 4498.82
not a Jew

4495.62 --> 4498.82
that's that's what that is

4505.28 --> 4510.28
yeah

4506.5 --> 4514.34
no practice no Jew

4510.28 --> 4517.639999999999
no practice no Jew

4514.34 --> 4521.54
yeah if you don't practice your religion

4517.64 --> 4525.52
but you just call yourself a Jew then

4521.54 --> 4525.5199999999995
you ain't no Jew

4535.71 --> 4538.819
[Music]

4543.29 --> 4546.38
[Music]

4549.44 --> 4555.799999999999
yeah more colored

4552.199 --> 4558.379999999999
but this time it's no practice no Jew

4555.8 --> 4561.64
I think that that works really

4558.38 --> 4561.64
really well

4569.94 --> 4577.33
[Music]

4593.84 --> 4597.9400000000005
let's see how that title holds up

4598.4 --> 4603.5199999999995
I'm not being negative here on the

4600.739 --> 4603.5199999999995
contrary so

4614.239 --> 4619.099999999999
tall move following Jews yeah but if you

4617.48 --> 4621.08
followed the tell mode then you don't

4619.1 --> 4624.02
follow the god of the Bible

4621.08 --> 4626.32
yeah the god of the Bible doesn't give a

4624.02 --> 4626.320000000001
[ __ ]

4626.659 --> 4632.799999999999
about little trixies that you can use to

4629.96 --> 4632.8
make an excuse

4633.56 --> 4639.1990000000005
right I mean the Tom would might help

4636.679 --> 4642.26
you to follow the letter of the supposed

4639.199 --> 4644.0
law but not the spirit of the law when

4642.26 --> 4646.04
the spirit of the law is the entire

4644.0 --> 4648.98
[ __ ] point

4646.04 --> 4652.96
its part is pointless yet the tall mood

4648.98 --> 4652.959999999999
only works in a theocracy

4658.52 --> 4663.219
it only works in etheocracy

4664.88 --> 4669.02
right

4666.02 --> 4670.159000000001
it's a legalistic approach to the laws

4669.02 --> 4673.46
of God

4670.159 --> 4675.66
and it's ridiculous because it doesn't

4673.46 --> 4677.3
uphold the spirit of God

4675.66 --> 4680.12
[Music]

4677.3 --> 4681.9800000000005
and then they come and say yeah but who

4680.12 --> 4683.9
are you to say that you know the spirit

4681.98 --> 4686.98
of God we think the spirit of God

4683.9 --> 4686.98
actually wants this

4694.97 --> 4698.1
[Music]

4709.94 --> 4715.0
talk about this dog [ __ ] I would know

4712.1 --> 4715.0

I heard enough about it

4717.56 --> 4723.38
Jesuit guy actually threatened to kill

me once when I said that I read it when

I hadn't

4725.9 --> 4729.679
I heard of it I didn't read it I kind of

4728.3 --> 4733.179
bluffed that I read it and he almost

4729.679 --> 4733.179
threatened to kill me over that

4735.44 --> 4737.86
like

4738.5 --> 4743.719
when I was 18 or something

4741.5 --> 4745.69
yeah crazy isn't that

this is uh

annoying I'm not here to indulge your

your hunger the [ __ ] on Jews I don't

4829.04 --> 4832.3
like that at all you see

4837.02 --> 4840.88
and it's kind of pointless to

4838.64 --> 4843.860000000001
continually call them Jews because

4840.88 --> 4846.8
there's plenty of Jews out there that

4843.86 --> 4850.12
are actually Jewish they have nothing to

4846.8 --> 4850.12
do with those scumbags

4852.26 --> 4857.900000000001
like at best they just [ __ ] to them at

4878.679 --> 4883.04
Jesus said nobody gets to the father

4883.04 --> 4885.46
right

4893.78 --> 4900.259999999999
right they didn't say nobody gets to me

except through me though right it's

4900.26 --> 4906.5
always funny how he distinctly speaks of

another

4906.5 --> 4912.02
when he talks about father yeah

4909.739 --> 4915.379999999999
pretty sure that Jesus wasn't like a

4912.02 --> 4918.02
multiple personality disorder type

4915.38 --> 4918.87
pretty sure he saw himself very separate

4918.02 --> 4920.42

4925.699 --> 4930.099999999999
oh oh I did it again

4952.719 --> 4958.28
you have to go do family stuff all right

4956.06 --> 4961.580000000001
you piled on all the Jew hate here and

4958.28 --> 4964.599999999999
then you go do family stuff great

good luck with that

4968.42 --> 4971.86
sorry that's not fair it's not really

4979.88 --> 4985.400000000001
really like fascist superiority false

4982.94 --> 4987.259999999999
ideology how old is that

4985.4 --> 4990.139999999999
very old

4987.26 --> 4992.92
it's been there's at least since

4990.14 --> 4992.92
Medieval Times

4994.1 --> 4999.679
I mean fascist superiority

4996.92 --> 5002.38
superiority false ideology

4999.679 --> 5004.6
that's technically what the old nobility

5002.38 --> 5007.659000000001
had right

5004.6 --> 5010.54
I think that really like Nazism

5007.659 --> 5013.96
was kind of an attempt to

5010.54 --> 5016.239
seed a new nobility

5013.96 --> 5018.46
I really believe that that's what they

5016.239 --> 5020.379999999999
actually wanted to try with that

5018.46 --> 5022.719
right

5020.38 --> 5026.7390000000005
kind of like how the

5022.719 --> 5030.46
the Nouveau Rich the industrialists like

5026.739 --> 5033.04
became the new oligarchy nobility right

5030.46 --> 5036.82
the non-official I think that the Nazis

5033.04 --> 5038.32
wanted an actual new spiritual in a way

5036.82 --> 5040.44
nobility

5038.32 --> 5044.699
like

5040.44 --> 5048.299999999999
reseed the original nobility

5044.699 --> 5052.08
Traditions but then based on their

5048.3 --> 5052.08
ideology their View

5069.58 --> 5072.58
what

5076.35 --> 5081.58
[Music]

5078.46 --> 5085.0
the Trinity is debatable yeah debatably

5081.58 --> 5087.1
nonsensical and presuppositional

5097.95 --> 5101.96

5110.739 --> 5114.5199999999995
oh yeah I got an Illuminati called

5112.42 --> 5116.86
something I completely forgot but here

5114.52 --> 5119.38
it is

5116.86 --> 5121.92
I'm gonna take a bite out of that

5119.38 --> 5121.92
hmm

5129.76 --> 5131.76
um

5147.699 --> 5150.239
hmm

5151.42 --> 5155.32
but you do see my point right getting

5153.34 --> 5159.28
wisdom

5155.32 --> 5161.799999999999
that this superiority ideology that's

5159.28 --> 5164.8
what the nobility has

5161.8 --> 5167.38
I mean the Nazis is basically

5164.8 --> 5169.179
they do

5167.38 --> 5170.86
Prince Bernard

5169.179 --> 5174.46
right

5170.86 --> 5176.32
he was a Nazi

5174.46 --> 5177.58
he married

5176.32 --> 5180.88
with

5177.58 --> 5183.159
Our Queen at the time

5180.88 --> 5188.58
they do that on purpose

5183.159 --> 5188.58
yeah Nazis are part of the nobility

5189.04 --> 5193.739
like they have been they still are

5196.719 --> 5202.6
yeah there's Nazis married in Noble

5199.36 --> 5205.739
Bloodlines all over the place

5202.6 --> 5205.7390000000005
it's what they do

5205.78 --> 5213.759999999999
why because they the Nazis declare

5210.76 --> 5216.719
themselves the new nobility they have

5213.76 --> 5216.719
done that

5217.42 --> 5226.32
since the earlier 20th century

5220.239 --> 5226.32
and it's still happening right now

5226.659 --> 5231.28
yeah

5228.58 --> 5235.659
the Nazis basically

5231.28 --> 5239.219
fled into the noble bloodlines

5235.659 --> 5239.219
they bought themselves in

5241.54 --> 5246.76
because just like the nobility one of

5244.54 --> 5249.219
their primary objectives is to get

5246.76 --> 5252.46
complete mind control

5249.219 --> 5254.679
over the public which is a trait that

5252.46 --> 5257.679
the noble nobility

5254.679 --> 5261.58
has been trying to develop

5257.679 --> 5263.7390000000005
for a millennia or more

5261.58 --> 5269.139
they're the same

5263.739 --> 5271.419999999999
the Nazis are a new nobility

5269.139 --> 5274.659000000001
and they've gone underground and they've

5271.42 --> 5277.7390000000005
mingled in with all these royalties

5274.659 --> 5277.739
around the world

5277.96 --> 5284.26
and thereby yeah a lot of the nobility

5280.48 --> 5287.28
around the world is now Nazi adjacent

5284.26 --> 5287.280000000001
or full on

5287.32 --> 5291.699
and those people have a lot of money

5289.06 --> 5296.76
power and that's how they force their

5291.699 --> 5296.759999999999
stupid things like the wef agenda

5452.199 --> 5455.678999999999
yeah this is good that you say that

by the way getting wisdom that makes no

sense what you just said to me

5519.219 --> 5522.36
about Jesus

5529.239 --> 5535.178999999999
my life is fascinating yeah I bet it is

5532.78 --> 5538.12
like to think so I wish a whim a women

5535.179 --> 5540.219
would find it so and actually do

just keep staring me at a distance

rather die than become a politician

I don't feel as strongly about that

name some things Aries huh

they're just blabbering out nonsense

since you got such a majority of things

right almost everything that that's

5843.88 --> 5849.08
called the majority of things

that majority of things

5884.679 --> 5889.719
is not really capable of summarizing

5887.86 --> 5890.98
such things

5889.719 --> 5894.179
because

5890.98 --> 5894.178999999999
you're too weak

5894.88 --> 5900.159000000001
yeah

5897.28 --> 5903.58
it's it takes a certain amount of

5900.159 --> 5906.28
strength to actually just

5903.58 --> 5907.6
say those things say the agitations like

5906.28 --> 5909.759999999999
that

5907.6 --> 5911.92
right and when when you get into it you

5909.76 --> 5914.679
start to feel it

5911.92 --> 5916.36
and then you'll be more inclined to

5914.679 --> 5918.9400000000005
agree with it

5916.36 --> 5921.5199999999995

that's what it is and that's how it

5921.52 --> 5925.900000000001

that's what's real

huh

5930.52 --> 5936.76
the problem is not that I almost hate

so many [ __ ] things out there to hate

approach

5954.159 --> 5957.638999999999
no

5976.3 --> 5981.639
where I very much hated myself

5979.6 --> 5983.92
and then in moments of tensions I would

5981.639 --> 5987.06
like literally inflict psychological

5983.92 --> 5987.06
damage to myself

5995.08 --> 6000.6
it's like at some times

5997.96 --> 6002.58
I had just so much disdain for myself

6000.6 --> 6005.639
that that would have impulses to

6002.58 --> 6007.94
literally offend somebody that was

6005.639 --> 6007.9400000000005
actually

6008.34 --> 6013.52
cool with me just to get them to hate me

6013.98 --> 6018.5599999999995
because I hated me

6019.02 --> 6023.360000000001
it's the most destructive habit you

6020.699 --> 6023.36
could ever imagine

6026.219 --> 6030.679
and I'm still dealing with the Echoes of

6028.56 --> 6030.679
it

6033.96 --> 6037.62
it's just at some point you you're so

6036.0 --> 6039.42
[ __ ] frustrated with the world

6037.62 --> 6041.34
because of its ignorance that you're

6039.42 --> 6043.4400000000005
just like okay well

6041.34 --> 6045.179
I'm going to offend everyone I'm going

6043.44 --> 6047.759999999999
to break all your [ __ ] Comfort zones

6045.179 --> 6049.38
right now to tell you what you don't

6047.76 --> 6052.9800000000005
want to know

6049.38 --> 6056.34
which I think you should know and you're

6052.98 --> 6058.5199999999995
less of a human being if you don't want

6056.34 --> 6058.52
to

6058.56 --> 6062.280000000001
yeah and that really [ __ ] offends

6060.9 --> 6063.96
people

6062.28 --> 6066.5599999999995
because you're literally telling them

6063.96 --> 6066.56
what to do

6068.699 --> 6074.28
in a very visceral way and unless you

6071.34 --> 6078.1990000000005
physically threaten them

6074.28 --> 6078.199
they're not gonna do that at all

6084.78 --> 6090.599999999999
but they are gonna be

6087.32 --> 6092.219
self-defensive and offensive back

6090.6 --> 6095.159000000001
and

6092.219 --> 6097.26
sometimes I did that just because I

6095.159 --> 6100.4
wanted to basically be beat up because I

6097.26 --> 6100.400000000001
hated myself so much

6104.52 --> 6111.06
now these days it's like it's nothing

6107.82 --> 6114.54
like that like

6111.06 --> 6117.92
I'm out of that it was a very very long

6114.54 --> 6117.92
crawl out of the butt

6118.32 --> 6124.159
it took me like 24 years to get out of

6121.98 --> 6124.159
it

6124.56 --> 6130.26
it started very viciously it started

6127.679 --> 6133.1990000000005
unconsciously

6130.26 --> 6136.139
I would self-sabotage and literally not

6133.199 --> 6138.599999999999
understand why I did it

6136.139 --> 6142.04
and that would actually Kindle the

6138.6 --> 6142.04
conscious hatred for myself

6142.199 --> 6147.599999999999
but in a way yeah I suspect like did I

6144.78 --> 6149.58
just what is that is it am I cursed does

6147.6 --> 6151.92
my subconscious hate me

6149.58 --> 6154.38
that eventually led to me hating myself

6151.92 --> 6156.06
consciously because things just kept

6154.38 --> 6158.639
going wrong I would do things that would

6156.06 --> 6162.360000000001
ruin everything make people hate me

6158.639 --> 6164.219
that from one side of my conscience I

6162.36 --> 6168.78
did not want I want everybody to like me

6164.219 --> 6173.2390000000005
but yet I then got moods that made me

6168.78 --> 6173.239
want to make everybody hate me

6173.4 --> 6179.099999999999
really frustrating

6176.28 --> 6182.179
I had to crawl out of that

6179.1 --> 6182.179
like 20 years

6183.48 --> 6186.799999999999
and I got it under control

6198.239 --> 6204.9
because I don't hate myself now

6202.26 --> 6207.3
I'm very disappointed in myself in many

6204.9 --> 6209.58
ways but I've also grown to understand

6207.3 --> 6212.88
that yeah

6209.58 --> 6215.699
you really did your best Darwin it's re

6212.88 --> 6218.76
this result is really pathetic looking

6215.699 --> 6222.178999999999
from the outside but you really did your

6218.76 --> 6224.900000000001
best and I did try to do my best with

6222.179 --> 6224.9
everything I got

6225.48 --> 6230.218999999999
and I think that

6227.4 --> 6233.339999999999
in retrospect of where I am now what I

6230.219 --> 6236.78
can do now the freedom that I have the

6233.34 --> 6236.78
respect that I've attained

6237.36 --> 6242.94
compared to like 20 years ago

6241.26 --> 6247.1990000000005
like

6242.94 --> 6249.9
it's much more than I ever thought

6247.199 --> 6252.78
that I deserved to get

6249.9 --> 6256.159
I got more good things than I thought at

6252.78 --> 6256.159
the time I deserved to get

6259.02 --> 6264.900000000001
at a very very negative outlook future

6262.44 --> 6267.659
wise about myself that's why most of the

6264.9 --> 6270.36
time did not look at it at all

6267.659 --> 6273.659
but that caused me to not plan for the

6270.36 --> 6275.4
future to not plan a job career at all

6273.659 --> 6279.119
yeah

6275.4 --> 6282.9
that entire development phase the

6279.119 --> 6286.0199999999995
late teenager already adolescent that

6282.9 --> 6288.659
almost everybody goes through I just did

6286.02 --> 6293.719
not I did not go through it really

6288.659 --> 6293.719
because I was too psychologically broken

6295.56 --> 6301.280000000001
to do it I flunked out of that school of

6299.04 --> 6301.28
life

6312.659 --> 6316.98
so we could make art with yourself

6314.34 --> 6319.56
sabotage while some could make arguments

6316.98 --> 6321.718999999999
that you really like to be banned Ares

6319.56 --> 6324.360000000001
106.

6321.719 --> 6325.679
for saying such [ __ ] up things

6324.36 --> 6330.36
right

6325.679 --> 6333.96
unless you could mention an example

6330.36 --> 6335.159
Aries 106. yeah mention an example

6333.96 --> 6338.9
do it

6335.159 --> 6338.9
mention an example right now

6342.119 --> 6345.199
or I'm Banning you

6348.42 --> 6354.659
mention an example or I am Banning you

6351.6 --> 6355.88
again Aries 106.

6354.659 --> 6360.36
yeah

6355.88 --> 6362.400000000001
these [ __ ] up little gamma backstabs

6360.36 --> 6365.159
dude if you're gonna stab me in the back

6362.4 --> 6368.719
you do it to my face yeah so you you

6365.159 --> 6374.179
[ __ ] put down an example of that

6368.719 --> 6374.179
right now or I'm kicking you out

6375.96 --> 6381.96
Banning people that could potentially

6378.54 --> 6384.3
support me financially oh really

6381.96 --> 6387.119
when

6384.3 --> 6390.3
so when could you potentially do that

6387.119 --> 6392.4
after not having done that yet said

6390.3 --> 6396.78
sitting in my chat

6392.4 --> 6400.619
for like three four years

6396.78 --> 6404.0599999999995
yeah what people did I ever ban that

6400.619 --> 6404.0599999999995
would actually give me money

6404.159 --> 6409.259999999999
and not just whine and complain and try

6406.739 --> 6411.178999999999
to maneuver me into being their slave so

6409.26 --> 6413.46
that I would do what the what they said

6411.179 --> 6415.02
so they would handle me a bit of cash

6413.46 --> 6418.219
yeah

6415.02 --> 6418.219
I'm not doing that

6421.92 --> 6425.76
where I slap myself in the face yeah but

6424.44 --> 6428.099999999999
I mean

6425.76 --> 6429.360000000001
that's an honest expression

6428.1 --> 6432.4800000000005
clammy

6429.36 --> 6436.0199999999995
how is that self-sabotage

6432.48 --> 6438.54
did that make people tune out and it's

6436.02 --> 6440.9400000000005
like oh my God arwen's gone too far now

6438.54 --> 6442.56
he slapped himself in the face when he

6440.94 --> 6446.58
was talking about something that really

6442.56 --> 6450.0
frustrated about himself oh my God oh my

6446.58 --> 6452.159
God I can't do that anymore I'm out I'm

6450.0 --> 6455.04
never watching our win again I mean he

6452.159 --> 6457.92
slapped himself in the face

6455.04 --> 6461.159
over something that really frustrated

6457.92 --> 6464.6990000000005
him about himself my God that's that's

6461.159 --> 6466.0199999999995
just too far that's just too far how the

6464.699 --> 6469.0199999999995
hell is that supposed to be

6466.02 --> 6469.02
self-sabotage

6473.88 --> 6480.7390000000005
clammy how is that self-sabotage

6477.0 --> 6480.739
yeah I get very expressive

6482.04 --> 6488.1
I get very passionate

6485.219 --> 6490.7390000000005
is that self sabotage how is that

6488.1 --> 6494.0
sabotaging what I do

6490.739 --> 6494.0
or my audience

6495.179 --> 6498.84
have either of you actually thought

6497.58 --> 6503.0
through

6498.84 --> 6503.0
how all of this works what I do here

6505.679 --> 6509.179
hey Richard G good to see you

6526.92 --> 6531.84
all right so Ares 106 do you know any

6529.739 --> 6535.879999999999
individual that I banned

6531.84 --> 6535.88
that would have financially supported me

6541.199 --> 6545.82
except for Phil B but I mean I just

6543.84 --> 6547.860000000001
could not tolerate that [ __ ] old

6545.82 --> 6551.04
idiot anymore

6547.86 --> 6552.42
is the worst he spams absolute [ __ ]

6551.04 --> 6556.739
[ __ ]

6552.42 --> 6558.719
like he is like blatantly [ __ ]

6556.739 --> 6562.04
I didn't want him in my chat even if I

6558.719 --> 6562.04
did if he did get me some money

6567.42 --> 6572.04
and that's like the only person that

6569.88 --> 6573.659000000001
ever gave me money that I actually ended

6572.04 --> 6576.44
up at Banning

6573.659 --> 6576.44
so

6576.6 --> 6580.26
yeah

6577.92 --> 6583.86
I don't remember Banning anybody else

6580.26 --> 6586.02
that actually supported me

6583.86 --> 6587.699
except for some gamma troll who sent me

6586.02 --> 6588.780000000001
five bucks and then thought that he

6587.699 --> 6591.239
owned me

6588.78 --> 6593.88
and and he literally sent me complaining

6591.239 --> 6597.839999999999
Revenge emails of how I banned him while

6593.88 --> 6601.219
I gave him money well yeah but I mean I

6597.84 --> 6605.6
don't want those types of people around

6601.219 --> 6605.6
Mr sensible yeah

6606.119 --> 6611.82
what you you think that he gives people

6608.699 --> 6616.339999999999
money George Sanford really

6611.82 --> 6616.34
who who does he actually give money

6617.159 --> 6621.42
he's certainly not gonna give me any

6619.199 --> 6623.699
money George Sanford what a weird thing

6621.42 --> 6624.9
to say why why would you mention that

6623.699 --> 6627.78
guy

6624.9 --> 6630.54
besides like

6627.78 --> 6633.9
I'm homophobic

6630.54 --> 6636.9
I I can't stand him

6633.9 --> 6639.659
his mannerism his stance like he's a

6636.9 --> 6641.58
[ __ ] I don't care if he supposedly is

6639.659 --> 6643.199
married or whatever he is a [ __ ]

6641.58 --> 6646.8
[ __ ]

6643.199 --> 6648.239
and I cannot I cannot be around that guy

6646.8 --> 6651.4400000000005
ever

6648.239 --> 6651.44
he makes me nauseated

6656.52 --> 6661.8
he claims he gave me money

6659.46 --> 6666.139
well in that case he's just a liar

6661.8 --> 6666.139
because he hasn't given me money

6671.219 --> 6676.699
maybe he gave me like a PayPal one time

6676.739 --> 6681.119
or something

6678.42 --> 6682.56
and then invited me on this show and

6681.119 --> 6684.78
that's the time where he basically

6682.56 --> 6688.1990000000005
continually played

6684.78 --> 6691.0199999999995
stupid little funny clips over my

6688.199 --> 6692.879999999999
explanations live when I was responding

6691.02 --> 6695.659000000001
to his inquiries

6692.88 --> 6695.659000000001
at that time

6696.179 --> 6701.4
I would have sent the money back

6699.36 --> 6704.5199999999995
if I didn't really need it at the time

6701.4 --> 6707.659
because I mean I don't want money from

6704.52 --> 6707.659000000001
people like that ever

6708.179 --> 6715.28
unless it is unless I can use that money

6711.38 --> 6715.28
to set them on fire

6715.86 --> 6719.0599999999995
then I'll take it

6730.26 --> 6737.6
and grew f is on 24 7 Discord yeah roof

6733.56 --> 6737.6
is just he is just horrible

6738.42 --> 6744.8
he's just a horrible dirty dilapidated

6742.32 --> 6744.799999999999
wizard

6744.9 --> 6749.36
just obsessed with Petty manipulation

6757.44 --> 6763.94
okay that ugly sent me lots of money

6761.159 --> 6763.94
no

6765.0 --> 6770.58
no he does not clammy

6767.28 --> 6772.82
I mean he sends me like five bucks

6770.58 --> 6775.88
every few months

6772.82 --> 6775.88
[Music]

6787.46 --> 6794.639
I think all together I got about like 30

6791.3 --> 6797.820000000001
Euros from Nathan

6794.639 --> 6801.86
all over the years so

6797.82 --> 6801.86
he does not send me lots of money

6804.119 --> 6809.5199999999995
but I do get attention

6806.639 --> 6811.7390000000005
and a Divergent Droid is always like

6809.52 --> 6813.3
very elaborately advertising for me

6811.739 --> 6815.04
which is amazing

6813.3 --> 6817.639
I never even asked him to do that he

6815.04 --> 6817.639
just does that

6821.28 --> 6825.0
but uh

6822.719 --> 6827.76
no there's a lot of people that follow

6825.0 --> 6830.52
actually follow me here and are active

6827.76 --> 6833.04
in my chat that have given me a lot more

6830.52 --> 6835.7390000000005
money in a single PayPal donation than

6833.04 --> 6837.9
Nathan has all scrapped together

6835.739 --> 6842.36
so

6837.9 --> 6842.36
Divergent Droid is awesome yes indeed

6852.36 --> 6858.0
isn't diverting Droid a bot no

6855.96 --> 6860.6
no he is not he is a person with an

6858.0 --> 6860.6
actual voice

6865.139 --> 6869.88
I spoke to him on Discord so

6868.8 --> 6872.070000000001
okay

6869.88 --> 6875.22
okay

6872.07 --> 6875.219999999999
[Music]

6878.21 --> 6882.229
[Music]

6888.0 --> 6891.36
it's a hilarious Dude too by the way

6890.159 --> 6893.46
because

6891.36 --> 6896.04
every time he's like oh I got an

6893.46 --> 6900.0
engagement I really have to take care of

6896.04 --> 6902.699
the birthday of my daughter or something

6900.0 --> 6905.34
like that and he then he like really

6902.699 --> 6908.58
apologizes and I always make a joke now

6905.34 --> 6911.28
like how dare you have a life how dare

6908.58 --> 6915.36
you neglect your

6911.28 --> 6917.699
your online fed Duty because of your

6915.36 --> 6920.28
family this is a disgrace

6917.699 --> 6923.099999999999
because he's just so ridiculously

6920.28 --> 6925.259999999999
apologetic about why he can't be in the

6923.1 --> 6927.9800000000005
chat doing what he does at times it's

6925.26 --> 6927.9800000000005
hilarious

6928.44 --> 6932.879999999999
I mean he really likes doing that

6930.84 --> 6935.96
apparently he thinks it's

6932.88 --> 6935.96
the best thing ever

6937.5 --> 6943.26
but I mean it's great to have a guy

6939.96 --> 6946.699
around with that level of enthusiasm

6943.26 --> 6946.6990000000005
it's very stimulating

6949.5 --> 6953.96
does Michael Khan send me money no

6966.96 --> 6972.9800000000005
but I mean Michael Khan is not a rich

6968.88 --> 6972.9800000000005
guy he's pretty poor himself so

6979.92 --> 6985.26
oh going back to work not around ah it's

6983.52 --> 6987.06
too bad

6985.26 --> 6991.639
we're gonna miss you slow-mo but I mean

6987.06 --> 6991.639
I hope the job's gonna be good for you

6995.699 --> 7000.46
good luck

6998.04 --> 7000.46
yeah

7021.38 --> 7025.9400000000005
do I think Jared is the richest planet

7024.199 --> 7028.719
right there

7025.94 --> 7028.719
no

7038.36 --> 7040.36
no

7041.9 --> 7046.36
I'm sorry that he even is a flat earther

7050.599 --> 7057.02
I think Jaron is more about Jaron

7054.38 --> 7061.28
than about Flat Earth I mean did you see

7057.02 --> 7062.719
that freaking video he did with mac2

7061.28 --> 7065.78
that's like

7062.719 --> 7069.44
the most ridiculous

7065.78 --> 7072.259999999999
conversation I've ever seen

7069.44 --> 7075.08
like that would have been great if it

7072.26 --> 7078.52
happened in 2015 or 60 and that would be

7075.08 --> 7078.5199999999995
super reasonable but I mean

7079.28 --> 7083.139
it was just ridiculous

7087.199 --> 7095.78
like he he gave mctoon everything

7092.139 --> 7098.679
he gave him all of it

7095.78 --> 7101.599
let him go get away with every stupid

7098.679 --> 7105.46
presuppositional argument ever it's so

7101.599 --> 7105.46
Preposterous so unnecessary

7109.46 --> 7114.619
it just gave him the glow he just gave

7111.92 --> 7116.2390000000005
him the full win like apparently I

7114.619 --> 7117.679
didn't see the video but Nathan was

7116.239 --> 7120.138999999999
described by how Neptune is like

7117.679 --> 7123.139
continually smiling there

7120.139 --> 7125.96
Cosmic too knows like jaron's just

7123.139 --> 7127.9400000000005
giving me the win he's just giving me

7125.96 --> 7130.219
all of the win

7127.94 --> 7132.619
he's not even like oh oh you didn't

7130.219 --> 7135.32
think of that no it's just jiren is like

7132.619 --> 7137.739
oh yeah yeah yeah look what the [ __ ]

7135.32 --> 7137.739
dude

7140.239 --> 7145.419999999999
yeah

7141.619 --> 7145.42
and then he even talks

7145.52 --> 7151.159000000001
about he complains about the editing in

7148.52 --> 7153.92
Beyond The Curve movie like oh they were

7151.159 --> 7156.98
so disingenuous with us and they edited

7153.92 --> 7160.6990000000005
out of context it's like so mean

7156.98 --> 7164.54
he's complaining about that while he wow

7160.699 --> 7167.239
years later he is doing what seems more

7164.54 --> 7169.76
like a debate a discussion more like an

7167.239 --> 7171.919999999999
I don't know what the hell that was

7169.76 --> 7174.56
the discussion with like a notorious

7171.92 --> 7177.4
anti-flat earther and conceding to like

7174.56 --> 7177.400000000001
every point

7177.44 --> 7181.719
only to end up complaining about

7179.54 --> 7185.719
something that is literally

7181.719 --> 7187.88
insignificant and unimportant

7185.719 --> 7190.4800000000005
there was a complete

7187.88 --> 7190.4800000000005
[ __ ] up

7192.08 --> 7197.42
like Nathan got a relive it over it he

7194.54 --> 7201.56
could really pissed off and so did I I

7197.42 --> 7205.84
mean that's like unsubscribed dude like

7201.56 --> 7205.84
Jaron is not a flat earther

7206.3 --> 7213.02
he's a [ __ ] shill

7209.42 --> 7217.4
let me just watch that mctoon show he's

7213.02 --> 7218.84
a shell Garen is a shill classic

7217.4 --> 7222.5
standard

7218.84 --> 7225.679
he gave mctoon everything

7222.5 --> 7227.179
he gave him everything every argument he

7225.679 --> 7229.6990000000005
gave him

7227.179 --> 7232.219
without any resistance only to start

7229.699 --> 7234.678999999999
bickering about some stupid little

7232.219 --> 7236.4800000000005
detail in the whole category of

7234.679 --> 7240.92
information that's completely

7236.48 --> 7243.32
Superfluous because we got argumentation

7240.92 --> 7245.659
that make all that completely

7243.32 --> 7247.46
superfluous

7245.659 --> 7249.799999999999
and that's what he was complaining about

7247.46 --> 7251.84
like somebody who literally doesn't know

7249.8 --> 7254.3
what the [ __ ] going on

7251.84 --> 7256.34
because it seems like jiren just doesn't

7254.3 --> 7259.52
know what the [ __ ] going on he's

7256.34 --> 7262.400000000001
either got serious dementia

7259.52 --> 7264.4400000000005
like actual dementia

7262.4 --> 7266.0
or Alzheimer's or something I don't know

7264.44 --> 7269.419999999999
what the [ __ ] he's been doing

7266.0 --> 7274.099
but it seems like he's demented or he is

7269.42 --> 7275.659
like a spiteful satanic traitor type

7274.099 --> 7279.34
that just

7275.659 --> 7279.339999999999
actually hates Flat Earth

7283.58 --> 7288.739
it's like oh I'm on your side while he's

7286.099 --> 7291.08
there to destroy it like a real satanic

7288.739 --> 7293.119
type I mean it seems like that he seems

7291.08 --> 7295.099
like that more and more

7293.119 --> 7298.699
as time has passed it just seems like

7295.099 --> 7302.8
that either he is completely demented

7298.699 --> 7302.799999999999
like he's really that [ __ ] stupid

7303.98 --> 7309.86
which is very logical

7306.199 --> 7313.119
or he's sabotaging Flat Earth

7309.86 --> 7313.119
which makes him a chill

7313.219 --> 7316.699
right sabotaging the listeners that

7315.679 --> 7319.159
trust him

7316.699 --> 7320.719
like a shield

7319.159 --> 7323.5
inserting

7320.719 --> 7326.9
useless information not helpful

7323.5 --> 7329.0
techniques on how to actually defeat

7326.9 --> 7331.94
Global argumentation

7329.0 --> 7334.76
he did none of that seems like he was

7331.94 --> 7338.659
more concerned in showing that you can't

7334.76 --> 7341.0
be civilized to a baller while you

7338.659 --> 7343.04
literally make them win every single

7341.0 --> 7346.28
argument they bring forth

7343.04 --> 7348.56
oh you're great Jared all you were so

7346.28 --> 7352.099
nice to him while he literally

7348.56 --> 7354.580000000001
intellectually raped you like a [ __ ]

7352.099 --> 7354.58
loser

7359.5 --> 7364.76
right but yeah that review lasts in a

7362.54 --> 7365.719
while I think it came out in the members

7364.76 --> 7367.400000000001
only

7365.719 --> 7371.619
stream

7367.4 --> 7371.619
yesterday so you might have seen that

7373.099 --> 7378.02
but it was ridiculous Jared's like that

7375.679 --> 7380.06
was like the worst thing that was like

7378.02 --> 7383.320000000001
one of the worst videos he's ever done

7380.06 --> 7383.320000000001
the one with Nicktoon

7390.38 --> 7393.28
thank you

7401.0 --> 7407.38
yeah anyway man time is flown over two

7405.139 --> 7407.38
hours

7407.42 --> 7410.1990000000005
ah

7420.619 --> 7425.139
it's all about the money well yeah it

7422.659 --> 7425.138999999999
seems so

7426.32 --> 7429.28
it's pathetic

7429.86 --> 7434.119
I mean

7431.36 --> 7437.0
what is a flat earther about what is it

7434.119 --> 7438.38
really about what makes a flat Earth or

7437.0 --> 7442.58
in a flat Earth or what makes them

7438.38 --> 7443.96
successful in being a flat earther

7442.58 --> 7446.599
well

7443.96 --> 7451.36
knowing the arguments

7446.599 --> 7451.360000000001
being up to date with the arguments

7451.82 --> 7456.739
knowing how to refute

7455.3 --> 7459.08
claims

7456.739 --> 7461.0599999999995
within physics

7459.08 --> 7464.0599999999995
that aren't being backed with actual

7461.06 --> 7466.6990000000005
argumentation knowing debating knowing

7464.06 --> 7468.4400000000005
argumentation knowing the fallacies

7466.699 --> 7470.598999999999
and that's pretty tough to get to know

7468.44 --> 7472.759999999999
them all it's it's not going to be easy

7470.599 --> 7474.4400000000005
for you to just point out a fallacy

7472.76 --> 7475.219
every time unless you have a knack for

7474.44 --> 7478.82
that

7475.219 --> 7481.4
but it's easy to over generalize with it

7478.82 --> 7483.08
right so it's there's a lot you can do

7481.4 --> 7485.0599999999995
to be a successful Flat Earth and it

7483.08 --> 7487.179
doesn't seem that Jaron is doing any of

7485.06 --> 7487.179
it

7491.3 --> 7493.4800000000005
thank you

7499.4 --> 7503.839999999999
most YouTubers are all about the money

7501.5 --> 7506.9
well then they're about like extracting

7503.84 --> 7508.159000000001
money that's like hostile extracting of

7506.9 --> 7510.44
money

7508.159 --> 7513.799999999999
I mean Nathan is definitely about the

7510.44 --> 7516.04
money but he's also about loyalty it's

7513.8 --> 7516.04
about

7516.44 --> 7521.9
a big part of where where we're all

7518.54 --> 7526.9
ending up getting money for here and

7521.9 --> 7526.9
myself included is because of loyalty

7527.36 --> 7532.82
and not you to being loyal to me like a

7530.36 --> 7535.759999999999
vassal or anything but it's loyalty to

7532.82 --> 7538.0
what I do and why I do it on what

7535.76 --> 7538.0
position

7538.76 --> 7544.52
of the continuing battle I stand

7542.0 --> 7547.88
what side do I stand do I stand on the

7544.52 --> 7550.280000000001
right side well I do my absolute best

7547.88 --> 7552.32
to do that and you guys know that about

7550.28 --> 7553.58
me if you followed me you know that

7552.32 --> 7556.96
that's like

7553.58 --> 7556.96
that's everything to me

7557.78 --> 7563.8
it's very tortures me if I turn out to

7560.719 --> 7563.8
have been wrong about something

7565.659 --> 7571.58
that's why I'm always correcting like

7568.46 --> 7573.92
every time I get really angry

7571.58 --> 7576.32
then afterward oh my she'll get angry

7573.92 --> 7578.96
and afterward I'm like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]

7576.32 --> 7580.699
what what did I say

7578.96 --> 7582.679
like what's gonna happen and then the

7580.699 --> 7585.199
next day I talk about it I talk about

7582.679 --> 7588.32
what I felt I thought and

7585.199 --> 7593.619
how I thought about it when I was calmer

7588.32 --> 7593.619
I do that it's all open open development

7594.8 --> 7601.6990000000005
I so honesty loyalty

7598.34 --> 7604.28
I like to think that that's the reason

7601.699 --> 7608.419999999999
honesty loyalty and the stability right

7604.28 --> 7610.88
this show being here always

7608.42 --> 7613.58
this is the place that you guys can

7610.88 --> 7615.8
literally pop in the chat and that you

7613.58 --> 7617.659
know you're going to be surrounded by

7615.8 --> 7618.92
other guys that you probably already

7617.659 --> 7622.46
know

7618.92 --> 7624.7390000000005
that are the same that know what's going

7622.46 --> 7626.06
on that know how to up to hold the rules

7624.739 --> 7628.699
here

7626.06 --> 7630.1990000000005
and you know that this is a good place

7628.699 --> 7631.879999999999
to develop

7630.199 --> 7634.04
and that it's always going to be like

7631.88 --> 7636.56
that that is not going to dilapidate one

7634.04 --> 7639.38
day I'm not letting it elaborate I'm

7636.56 --> 7641.2390000000005
only making it more refined more

7639.38 --> 7643.52
stricter so that you know that that's

7641.239 --> 7645.86
always going to be there like I'm always

7643.52 --> 7650.8
here like a spiritual Safe Haven where

7645.86 --> 7650.799999999999
you can be in that specific way

7651.02 --> 7655.9400000000005
like be actually spiritually

7652.84 --> 7659.900000000001
intellectually active

7655.94 --> 7662.119
for good and not just like a cog in a

7659.9 --> 7664.219
machine whether you like it or not right

7662.119 --> 7666.5599999999995
which is almost everywhere else that's

7664.219 --> 7669.219
what I try to provide

7666.56 --> 7673.84
that stability

7669.219 --> 7673.84
loyalty and honesty

7675.199 --> 7680.36
and I like to think that that is the

7677.3 --> 7682.400000000001
reason that gets people over the edge of

7680.36 --> 7685.88
deciding like yes we need to support

7682.4 --> 7688.28
that regularly to keep it there I like

7685.88 --> 7690.26
to think that those three elements are

7688.28 --> 7692.619
the reason why people actually support

7690.26 --> 7692.619000000001
me

7698.179 --> 7704.179
yes I know I got very angry over the

7701.119 --> 7707.5599999999995
etymology error yes clammy

7704.179 --> 7707.56
don't need to remind me

7710.42 --> 7713.02
foreign

7713.78 --> 7717.88
yeah thank you Mark Jay that yes

7720.98 --> 7724.82
right

7722.26 --> 7728.06
I mean

7724.82 --> 7730.639
I see it like this if I'd be like pushed

7728.06 --> 7733.400000000001
directly or indirectly into selling out

7730.639 --> 7736.9400000000005
what I'm doing is I'm just gonna make

7733.4 --> 7739.339999999999
it's like you got this knife

7736.94 --> 7740.96
it's like it's getting a little bit

7739.34 --> 7743.42
blunt

7740.96 --> 7746.4800000000005
what they want to do is they want you to

7743.42 --> 7748.52
just put it down and maybe break the tip

7746.48 --> 7750.739
off as to completely damage it it's like

7748.52 --> 7753.139
no I'm gonna make it sharper like yeah

7750.739 --> 7755.299999999999
that makes everything tougher for me

7753.139 --> 7757.58
but I'm gonna do it anyway because

7755.3 --> 7759.139
there's being there I'm being pushed

7757.58 --> 7761.54
from all sides

7759.139 --> 7763.219
people are trying to manipulate me to

7761.54 --> 7766.34
become something else

7763.219 --> 7769.46
so I'd rather take more suffering and

7766.34 --> 7771.32
become more strict

7769.46 --> 7774.5
like as a countermeasure it's like oh

7771.32 --> 7776.719
you're all gonna pile on to try to push

7774.5 --> 7780.08
me to transform like this

7776.719 --> 7783.199
well then I'll just do what I did twice

7780.08 --> 7785.599
as much as a revenge for your

7783.199 --> 7788.78
manipulation attempt

7785.599 --> 7791.859
yeah that's what I do

7788.78 --> 7791.8589999999995
[Music]

7795.7 --> 7798.8099999999995
[Music]

7798.88 --> 7804.38
it's also to show like that you can't

7802.58 --> 7807.0199999999995
manipulate me

7804.38 --> 7809.179
you really can even when so many people

7807.02 --> 7812.06
try

7809.179 --> 7814.9400000000005
just doesn't work on me because I made

7812.06 --> 7816.92
it my life's work to not make that work

7814.94 --> 7819.919999999999
on me

7816.92 --> 7822.76
and that life's work goes farther than

7819.92 --> 7822.76
you wanna know

7824.599 --> 7829.76
because that reaches even into my Dark

7827.36 --> 7832.659
World Vision And Nightmares and [ __ ]

7829.76 --> 7832.659000000001
yeah

7833.119 --> 7838.46
life in the dark world like endured

7836.06 --> 7841.639
horrific sightings and like

7838.46 --> 7844.28
psychological torture that I don't even

7841.639 --> 7846.32
have the words to express what that was

7844.28 --> 7851.0
like

7846.32 --> 7852.86
and I endured all of it just to not

7851.0 --> 7855.44
change

7852.86 --> 7858.679
because all of that there was all to

7855.44 --> 7861.619
burn me out to make me Hollow so that a

7858.679 --> 7863.9
demon would take me over that's the

7861.619 --> 7865.88
reason why all of it happened is the

7863.9 --> 7869.32
reason why it took so long

7865.88 --> 7869.32
because it wouldn't work

7869.34 --> 7872.4890000000005
[Music]

7886.219 --> 7891.9800000000005
so yeah I've literally endured torture

7893.48 --> 7898.218999999999
for this

7894.92 --> 7899.4800000000005
that's how much I don't give into peer

7898.219 --> 7902.119
pressure

7899.48 --> 7903.5599999999995
when I sometimes say like I'd rather be

7902.119 --> 7905.54
tortured

7903.56 --> 7910.780000000001
then give in to this

7905.54 --> 7910.78
well I've already been tortured

7912.139 --> 7916.639
and didn't give in

7914.179 --> 7918.92
that's actually what I'm saying

7916.639 --> 7922.52
it's just that I didn't get physically

7918.92 --> 7925.34
tortured it happened in spirit in a

7922.52 --> 7927.679
surreal experience

7925.34 --> 7929.96
and they were obsessed with

7927.679 --> 7932.96
accomplishing that yeah so don't think

7929.96 --> 7935.4800000000005
that those troll asses out here and peer

7932.96 --> 7939.199
pressuring both Tarts that they're also

7935.48 --> 7941.119
special and unique I've I've fought the

7939.199 --> 7943.78
very essence

7941.119 --> 7947.54
of what feeds them

7943.78 --> 7950.84
personified in spirit in a literal

7947.54 --> 7954.5
face-to-face experience

7950.84 --> 7957.7390000000005
okay I've already fought the Masters

7954.5 --> 7960.08
that pull their strings without them

7957.739 --> 7964.459999999999
knowing or believing it

7960.08 --> 7967.86
I fought those demons literally

7964.46 --> 7974.36
yeah not metaphorically

7967.86 --> 7976.96
[Music]

7974.36 --> 7979.94
I faced literal

7976.96 --> 7983.9800000000005
red-horned devils

7979.94 --> 7987.098999999999
that would try to break me over

7983.98 --> 7990.98
legal based

7987.099 --> 7993.26
cosmology argumentation

7990.98 --> 7996.259999999999
it was really bizarre experience that

7993.26 --> 7997.9400000000005
one but I literally faced a devil like

7996.26 --> 8000.52
the first time I actually in the Dark

7997.94 --> 8001.9
World saw a literal red horned devil

8000.52 --> 8004.360000000001
figure

8001.9 --> 8005.799999999999
that was trying to argue how I was

8004.36 --> 8010.42
guilty

8005.8 --> 8012.6990000000005
and then I inserted why all the premise

8010.42 --> 8014.4400000000005
of that Guild assumption was all false

8012.699 --> 8016.48
because it's based

8014.44 --> 8018.759999999999
on the Earth being a globe model I

8016.48 --> 8021.5199999999995
basically negated the entire spiritual

8018.76 --> 8024.219
law system based on the false

8021.52 --> 8026.139
premise of the Earth being a globe that

8024.219 --> 8027.639
all of it only was based on the Earth

8026.139 --> 8029.92
being a globe and that I could prove

8027.639 --> 8032.04
that it isn't and I did and the devil

8029.92 --> 8035.5
got so frustrated that he actually

8032.04 --> 8038.079
discontinued his death and I snapped out

8035.5 --> 8040.659
of that virtual reality interface that

8038.079 --> 8044.619
he created and saw

8040.659 --> 8047.619
the weird Red Sky Desert waste like

8044.619 --> 8050.199
desert with rocks rocks everywhere Rock

8047.619 --> 8052.36
escapes and sand

8050.199 --> 8055.0
was warm

8052.36 --> 8056.5599999999995
but it's a red sky everywhere it I

8055.0 --> 8061.84
thought it was hell because there were

8056.56 --> 8063.46
literal red horned Devils there

8061.84 --> 8066.04
but one of them

8063.46 --> 8068.139
tried to basically like

8066.04 --> 8070.84
it was like a final attempt to like

8068.139 --> 8073.4800000000005
convert me or something and I literally

8070.84 --> 8075.54
argued my way out to the point where he

8073.48 --> 8078.339999999999
just

8075.54 --> 8080.38
snapped out of his attempt

8078.34 --> 8082.719
it was amazing though because he

8080.38 --> 8084.579
literally took on the Visage of a

8082.719 --> 8088.4800000000005
well-known person

8084.579 --> 8090.5199999999995
that was well known to me in the world

8088.48 --> 8091.718999999999
it's kind of weird to say who that is

8090.52 --> 8092.92
but so I'm not going to do that right

8091.719 --> 8095.44
now

8092.92 --> 8098.139
like sitting behind a desk it's almost

8095.44 --> 8100.178999999999
like a an office it was in an office

8098.139 --> 8102.52
sitting with that person and I felt like

8100.179 --> 8105.54
I'm guilty I'm guilty I don't want to be

8102.52 --> 8105.540000000001
guilty ah

8105.82 --> 8110.739
don't ask me about what why because it

8108.34 --> 8113.38
was all just imprinted it was all forced

8110.739 --> 8115.78
upon me that experience

8113.38 --> 8117.6990000000005
very torturous and then he would argue

8115.78 --> 8120.099
like why I was guilty and how I should

8117.699 --> 8123.579
just surrender to that Justice and then

8120.099 --> 8126.159000000001
I used that I argued my way out

8123.579 --> 8128.199
basically explaining how any everything

8126.159 --> 8130.0599999999995
that I experienced wasn't technically

8128.199 --> 8133.839999999999
real because it wasn't

8130.06 --> 8137.26
and thereby proving my awareness of that

8133.84 --> 8139.4800000000005
I was not in the physical real world I

8137.26 --> 8143.4400000000005
basically turned the experience there

8139.48 --> 8146.919999999999
into a lucid dream

8143.44 --> 8150.94
yeah lucid dream in the middle of a Dark

8146.92 --> 8153.6990000000005
World extra bodily experience

8150.94 --> 8155.919999999999
now that's magical

8153.699 --> 8158.739
because that's like I'm in a Holodeck

8155.92 --> 8161.1990000000005
and suddenly I gain control over it

8158.739 --> 8165.78
partially and that happened

8161.199 --> 8165.78
plentiful times during the entire thing

8166.54 --> 8170.099
and that was one of those times

8184.84 --> 8191.02
yes nobody cares it's just mad so nobody

8188.86 --> 8193.779999999999
cares here nobody's gonna address that

8191.02 --> 8196.359
and I mean why why would they him

8193.78 --> 8200.399000000001
talking about weird surreal experiences

8196.359 --> 8200.399000000001
and now I'm facing a devil and

8203.34 --> 8209.92
but yeah I literally saw red horn devils

8207.88 --> 8211.839999999998
they exist apparently

8209.92 --> 8213.639
and they're walking around in a weird

8211.84 --> 8216.460000000001
red skyed

8213.639 --> 8219.639
Rocky desert

8216.46 --> 8222.16
and I was there for a bit

8219.639 --> 8223.598999999998
it was very different from what they

8222.16 --> 8226.24
expected

8223.599 --> 8228.34
also what I noticed with my Amphitheater

8226.24 --> 8231.34
was still working somehow is that the

8228.34 --> 8233.8
Devils were really just vacant

8231.34 --> 8235.66
they did not have a lot of internal

8233.8 --> 8238.42
feelings

8235.66 --> 8241.3
they were really kind of zombified and

8238.42 --> 8243.519
like really powerful but zombified

8241.3 --> 8245.979
like they had all this power but no

8243.519 --> 8249.04
purpose that's what I noticed about the

8245.979 --> 8251.639
Devils it was a very odd realization in

8249.04 --> 8251.639000000001
that experience

8251.92 --> 8254.92
foreign

8257.7 --> 8265.54
yeah but nobody's attempting to inquire

8262.84 --> 8267.84
sounds like Diablo 3 yeah but it wasn't

8265.54 --> 8267.84
though

8273.82 --> 8277.5
Diablo 3 wasn't out yet

8279.92 --> 8283.02
[Music]

8284.139 --> 8288.279999999999
you have to realize that the majority of

8286.599 --> 8292.599
my vision

8288.28 --> 8294.76
took place in 97.

8292.599 --> 8296.859
that's when the initiation was that's

8294.76 --> 8299.859
when the the trade when I got the sus

8296.859 --> 8302.16
the stuff when it it actually happened

8299.859 --> 8304.42
and then it just

8302.16 --> 8307.479
continued on

8304.42 --> 8310.26
with intervals

8307.479 --> 8313.539999999999
and this specific moment of the Devils

8310.26 --> 8315.939
was actually at my old home I remember

8313.54 --> 8319.84
where I saw that I was with the Jesuit

8315.939 --> 8323.16
guy and I told him what I saw

8319.84 --> 8323.16
when that when that happened

8333.639 --> 8339.899
dude I was having freaking Visions all

8337.059 --> 8339.899
the time guys

8340.0 --> 8346.179
I was back then I was literally like

8343.439 --> 8348.58
this this and that I experienced this

8346.179 --> 8351.16
I'm seeing second of the future dude I

8348.58 --> 8355.599
saw a [ __ ] iPhone I saw a [ __ ]

8351.16 --> 8358.119999999999
iPhone in 97 okay just like oh here look

8355.599 --> 8360.04
at my iPhone it's like a phone it's just

8358.12 --> 8362.08
one screen it's just the entire screen

8360.04 --> 8364.84
oh there's a video playing on it I'm

8362.08 --> 8366.88
seeing a balloon a balloon video really

8364.84 --> 8368.26
high up it's really distorted is like

8366.88 --> 8369.58
what the [ __ ] is this why are you

8368.26 --> 8372.639000000001
showing me this

8369.58 --> 8374.559
but that the device is kind of amazing

8372.639 --> 8379.3
but what is that what's that video yeah

8374.559 --> 8381.219
guess what I saw that video in 2018 it

8379.3 --> 8383.619999999999
was a crappy control opposition video

8381.219 --> 8386.139
where they attempted to prove

8383.62 --> 8388.0
something from the ball side it was

8386.139 --> 8394.0
really one of the crappier videos yeah

8388.0 --> 8397.24
but I saw that video though in 97.

8394.0 --> 8404.08
and I remember it

8397.24 --> 8405.84
I literally talked about it in 2016 on

8404.08 --> 8409.42
my show here

8405.84 --> 8413.92
before the video came out which came out

8409.42 --> 8413.92
later in like 2018

8414.28 --> 8419.02
yeah

8415.859 --> 8422.16
I don't give a [ __ ] Aries 106 has

8419.02 --> 8422.16
nothing to do with s

8424.06 --> 8434.439
I didn't have Diablo one in 97 I know

8429.64 --> 8438.58
because I first got it in 2001.

8434.439 --> 8443.439
I remember that I first got it in 2001

8438.58 --> 8445.899
you see so I didn't know Dr Blue I heard

8443.439 --> 8447.460000000001
people talking about it I didn't give a

8445.899 --> 8449.319
[ __ ]

8447.46 --> 8451.3
it didn't seem all that great to me

8449.319 --> 8455.619999999999
because I was playing Baldur's Gate and

8451.3 --> 8459.0
it was like amazingly Superior like way

8455.62 --> 8462.1
better than [ __ ] Diablo stupid

8459.0 --> 8464.14
Rocky I mean Diablo one is pathetic I

8462.1 --> 8465.76
mean it worked well but it's a pathetic

8464.14 --> 8468.819
game if you compare it to Baldur's Gate

8465.76 --> 8469.6
especially music wise oh my God is that

8468.819 --> 8472.66
better

8469.6 --> 8475.479000000001
like Diablo Diablo one is look that's

8472.66 --> 8477.22
cute and you get sick of it

8475.479 --> 8481.179999999998
eventually

8477.22 --> 8483.58
yeah Baldur's Gate I've played like 200

8481.18 --> 8485.859
times through at least

8483.58 --> 8487.899
yeah that's a game that's the one I was

8485.859 --> 8491.56
playing so I didn't know about the owl

8487.899 --> 8493.72
I'd never seen it on the screen

8491.56 --> 8497.26
this has nothing to do without demons I

8493.72 --> 8499.66
saw yeah nobody in Diablo there's no

8497.26 --> 8501.939
demon gonna show up in Diablo that's

8499.66 --> 8506.939
then gonna pop up on your screen

8501.939 --> 8506.939
and try to tell you why you're guilty

8507.7 --> 8513.899000000001
and you're going to go to hell okay

8509.8 --> 8513.899
that's it has nothing to do with that

8523.18 --> 8529.78
I should rename the iPhone to the E8 why

8528.28 --> 8531.960000000001
what the hell does that have to do with

8529.78 --> 8531.960000000001
anything

8535.42 --> 8539.76
that I might have had psychotic episodes

8540.16 --> 8546.76
yeah that's cute yeah or I just saw a

8543.34 --> 8548.08
[ __ ] iPhone in a vision in 97.

8546.76 --> 8550.06
okay

8548.08 --> 8551.859
and a whole bunch of other things and

8550.06 --> 8554.88
people literally talking about like yeah

8551.859 --> 8554.880000000001
we're from the future

8554.979 --> 8560.38
and then

8556.3 --> 8562.66
did showing [ __ ] proof of that

8560.38 --> 8565.599999999999
okay

8562.66 --> 8569.1
yeah the Jesuit guy told me it was a

8565.6 --> 8569.1
time traveler on the other side

8570.6 --> 8575.859
and he proved it by showing the [ __ ]

8574.42 --> 8578.14
iPhone

8575.859 --> 8581.62
when that never even existed I mean back

8578.14 --> 8584.38
then there were barely even Palm tops

8581.62 --> 8586.300000000001
I just barely knew that a palm top

8584.38 --> 8589.539999999999
existed and the science seemed kind of

8586.3 --> 8592.599999999999
cute yeah he saw a fully colored high

8589.54 --> 8595.300000000001
resolution iPhone

8592.6 --> 8596.800000000001
playing a YouTube video yeah a YouTube

8595.3 --> 8599.819
video

8596.8 --> 8604.359999999999
it literally had YouTube in the corner

8599.819 --> 8606.039999999999
YouTube didn't even exist yet

8604.36 --> 8608.84
[Music]

8606.04 --> 8612.059000000001
foreign

8608.84 --> 8612.059
[Music]

8623.439 --> 8627.479000000001
that was like over a decade later

8629.74 --> 8633.3
cool story yeah indeed

8633.7 --> 8640.12
I told this story by the way to Mark

8635.859 --> 8640.12
sargid in in like 2016.

8640.24 --> 8644.38
I told them a whole bunch of freakish

8642.1 --> 8649.12
Vision [ __ ] and he was like

8644.38 --> 8653.438999999998
okay look like that okay this is like he

8649.12 --> 8655.84
knew like okay this is [ __ ] insane

8653.439 --> 8657.460000000001
but it wasn't dismissing it it's just

8655.84 --> 8659.92
like yeah you're getting crazy Visions

8657.46 --> 8661.539999999999
aren't you because there were like

8659.92 --> 8663.7
hundreds of people

8661.54 --> 8665.859
continually doing this like oh I saw

8663.7 --> 8667.960000000001
your videos I got all these visions

8665.859 --> 8670.24
and it's like it seemed to like

8667.96 --> 8671.819
continually happen all the time to him

8670.24 --> 8674.14
and so people were continually

8671.819 --> 8675.76
contacting him and like I got this

8674.14 --> 8680.18
urgent Vision thing I need to share with

8675.76 --> 8681.28
you it's like okay tell me what it is

8680.18 --> 8683.439
[Music]

8681.28 --> 8687.479000000001
because everybody was doing that to him

8683.439 --> 8687.479000000001
at the time it was hilarious in a way

8687.58 --> 8691.42
but I think that I did also tell him

8689.859 --> 8694.24
about this

8691.42 --> 8698.02
and about how I met in the vision David

8694.24 --> 8700.0
Weiss in 97 and about how I learned

8698.02 --> 8702.52
about this stupid

8700.0 --> 8707.399
politics thing in the United States of

8702.52 --> 8707.399000000001
trump and the wife of of Clinton

8708.28 --> 8714.52
that I didn't care about

8711.46 --> 8717.3
but got the hair off for some reason in

8714.52 --> 8717.300000000001
97.

8719.96 --> 8723.24
[Music]

8724.3 --> 8729.34
so yeah oh might have heard us so I

8726.7 --> 8732.1
caught it break psychotic episode or

8729.34 --> 8735.880000000001
mental illness yeah yeah or I literally

8732.1 --> 8738.04
saw the [ __ ] future and it came true

8735.88 --> 8739.479
and I was subjected to the Cassandra

8738.04 --> 8742.300000000001
complex

8739.479 --> 8745.92
so I could have like written these

8742.3 --> 8745.92
things down in a book

8746.92 --> 8751.899
and then I would like have now have the

8749.319 --> 8753.34
book like see I wrote this down back in

8751.899 --> 8755.38
the time

8753.34 --> 8758.319
see here's the description here's the

8755.38 --> 8760.539999999999
sketch that didn't exist yet well people

8758.319 --> 8762.34
could then argue like oh yeah but it was

8760.54 --> 8763.720000000001
already in development so you could have

8762.34 --> 8766.24
known about it well guess what I didn't

8763.72 --> 8769.42
know [ __ ] because there was no internet

8766.24 --> 8771.939
I was not in the middle of like the

8769.42 --> 8773.859
development industry

8771.939 --> 8776.5
I was just sitting on the side like

8773.859 --> 8779.819
everybody else I didn't know what was

8776.5 --> 8779.819
being developed at all

8780.939 --> 8789.34
so I did not have some kind of Clue

8785.859 --> 8792.939
that could have like helped me shape

8789.34 --> 8795.939
in my mind seeing that thing

8792.939 --> 8798.819
there was nothing in my mind that would

8795.939 --> 8800.319
have formed that thing

8798.819 --> 8802.899
in the vision

8800.319 --> 8805.899
it was from the future

8802.899 --> 8807.819
it looked exactly like an iPhone even

8805.899 --> 8812.039999999999
with a stupid button at the bottom I

8807.819 --> 8812.039999999999
even even said that it looked ridiculous

8818.2 --> 8820.800000000001
okay

8825.1 --> 8830.02
the next time you're having a version

8827.319 --> 8832.899
about a future technology accented why I

8830.02 --> 8835.24
already did that I already said things

8832.899 --> 8837.22
that might happen like the holographic

8835.24 --> 8841.78
interfaces

8837.22 --> 8844.3
the crowns right oh brain chip yeah

8841.78 --> 8846.460000000001
[ __ ] useless [ __ ]

8844.3 --> 8848.279999999999
you just take the circlet

8846.46 --> 8851.279999999999
put it on

8848.28 --> 8853.359
and you're in

8851.28 --> 8855.76
you're out

8853.359 --> 8857.979000000001
don't do it too quickly that's very

8855.76 --> 8859.899
unhealthy

8857.979 --> 8861.519999999999
like you have to wait at least two

8859.899 --> 8865.74
minutes between

8861.52 --> 8865.74
taking it off and putting it back on

8866.319 --> 8869.979
yeah

8867.24 --> 8872.56
that's one of those things and the

8869.979 --> 8874.72
holographic monitors right it's like

8872.56 --> 8877.18
yeah you don't have a monitor you just

8874.72 --> 8880.899
have a little box there sitting behind

8877.18 --> 8883.78
your keyboard and then it's like three

8880.899 --> 8886.979
it just shows you a monitor in light in

8883.78 --> 8886.979000000001
a hologram in front of you

8889.18 --> 8894.399
right so I mean but I've talked about

8891.34 --> 8895.960000000001
this in like 2017.

8894.399 --> 8898.14
those are some of the things that are

8895.96 --> 8898.14
coming

8901.26 --> 8905.62
[Music]

8902.62 --> 8909.160000000002
[ __ ] would have that [ __ ] implanted in

8905.62 --> 8911.08
them it's so like you why would anybody

8909.16 --> 8913.24
ever do that

8911.08 --> 8915.16
when there's already technology where

8913.24 --> 8917.74
you literally can do the same thing

8915.16 --> 8920.2
without surgery it's so stupid I mean

8917.74 --> 8923.199999999999
there's already Google glasses

8920.2 --> 8926.140000000001
the system is effectively already there

8923.2 --> 8929.92
without you having to surgically implant

8926.14 --> 8932.619999999999
something okay it's so stupid

8929.92 --> 8935.26
the brain chip is like the dumbest idea

8932.62 --> 8938.439
ever except if you have like serious

8935.26 --> 8940.6
brain damage and you need

8938.439 --> 8942.7
like a chip just make yourself function

8940.6 --> 8945.1
or something right that's different

8942.7 --> 8948.34
that's different

8945.1 --> 8951.460000000001
that's like damage control

8948.34 --> 8954.34
but as a utility it's like one of the

8951.46 --> 8956.019999999999
dumbest thing you could possibly do when

8954.34 --> 8959.380000000001
there's already technology that makes

8956.02 --> 8962.439
you able to interface with technology

8959.38 --> 8964.96
by thinking without surgical

8962.439 --> 8968.26
intervention

8964.96 --> 8970.779999999999
so Google Glasses already exists

8968.26 --> 8974.939
well think of the Google Glass system

8970.78 --> 8974.939
but much more advanced

8974.979 --> 8981.34
and you just end up with a circlet

8978.1 --> 8982.220000000001
and you just put it on V and it just

8981.34 --> 8983.439
starts

8982.22 --> 8985.479
[Music]

8983.439 --> 8988.54
a tuning

8985.479 --> 8990.64
first time you you check it out starts

8988.54 --> 8993.34
to feel what's around

8990.64 --> 8996.819
you do some things to try the interface

8993.34 --> 9000.2
and then it just it has your profile and

8996.819 --> 9000.199999999999
you can just use it

9007.5 --> 9013.319
yeah imagine how I could yeah yeah sure

9010.38 --> 9015.979
zept happy so make work of it donate to

9013.319 --> 9015.979
my PayPal

9019.319 --> 9023.819
I could buy NASA and shut it no why

9021.96 --> 9025.56
would I do that

9023.819 --> 9028.859
I don't want to shut it

9025.56 --> 9031.68
make NASA great again make it actually

9028.859 --> 9034.62
cool make it not

9031.68 --> 9036.960000000001
filled with a bunch of sick [ __ ]

9034.62 --> 9039.78
but like have some serious Space

9036.96 --> 9042.72
Adventures with good CGI

9039.78 --> 9044.460000000001
like a purposeful story right I mean you

9042.72 --> 9046.8
could do it you could even make like a

9044.46 --> 9048.179999999998
you could even fake getting resources

9046.8 --> 9051.0
right

9048.18 --> 9053.220000000001
I mean drilling technology and all that

9051.0 --> 9055.74
is getting much better

9053.22 --> 9057.42
this is bound to get to some point where

9055.74 --> 9059.34
you're going to drill and like find an

9057.42 --> 9061.56
amazing set of resources this happens

9059.34 --> 9062.819
all the time people it happens all the

9061.56 --> 9066.24
[ __ ] time

9062.819 --> 9068.84
it's like wow we just drilled into this

9066.24 --> 9071.16
like gigantic pocket of

9068.84 --> 9073.74
iodine or

9071.16 --> 9076.8
like

9073.74 --> 9077.84
I don't know uranium or whatever it is

9076.8 --> 9080.519999999999
like

9077.84 --> 9083.04
new pockets of pure material well it's

9080.52 --> 9084.960000000001
very simple you find that you set up a

9083.04 --> 9087.960000000001
space adventure

9084.96 --> 9090.66
right and you say like oh we found this

9087.96 --> 9092.58
thing or like an asteroid we're gonna

9090.66 --> 9095.78
mine it and then just add a space

9092.58 --> 9095.78
adventure you make it good

9097.14 --> 9102.119999999999
and then you get back and you've mined

9100.14 --> 9103.56
this new pocket that you don't tell

9102.12 --> 9105.240000000002
anybody about

9103.56 --> 9108.38
and then it's like oh look at all the

9105.24 --> 9111.72
resources we just got from this asteroid

9108.38 --> 9115.08
everybody now wants to invest in the new

9111.72 --> 9117.24
space mining yeah dude I just continued

9115.08 --> 9119.939
the story except I wouldn't make it look

9117.24 --> 9123.439
[ __ ] satanic and [ __ ] that's the

9119.939 --> 9127.2
difference yeah if you make me

9123.439 --> 9130.14
leader of NASA I will make NASA great

9127.2 --> 9131.52
again I will just do it right I will

9130.14 --> 9134.46
give you something

9131.52 --> 9136.859
that makes space cool again instead of

9134.46 --> 9139.38
gay and [ __ ]

9136.859 --> 9142.800000000001
and depressed

9139.38 --> 9146.938999999998
I would just do that

9142.8 --> 9149.16
I wouldn't shut it down so what a waste

9146.939 --> 9151.2
I mean they already got a gigantic

9149.16 --> 9154.68
amount of money you might as well just

9151.2 --> 9157.380000000001
start actually using it to good have

9154.68 --> 9159.54
good theatrics right I mean it is a

9157.38 --> 9161.399
theatrics

9159.54 --> 9165.740000000002
Corporation

9161.399 --> 9165.74
so why not actually do it right

9172.439 --> 9179.34
you're gonna feel like game boys

9175.439 --> 9182.04
they they the iPhones are game boys

9179.34 --> 9182.86
except the games on them suck now that's

9182.04 --> 9186.049
the difference

9182.86 --> 9186.049
[Music]

9186.96 --> 9192.599999999999
and and the screens are slightly better

9190.5 --> 9196.26
but I mean

9192.6 --> 9198.42
the iPhone is just [ __ ] useless

9196.26 --> 9200.460000000001
I mean in the very far future you don't

9198.42 --> 9202.92
even you're not gonna need to carry

9200.46 --> 9205.858999999999
around a screen

9202.92 --> 9208.08
right in the future you'll just you'll

9205.859 --> 9209.76
probably will have an implant device but

9208.08 --> 9211.859
at that point it will be really

9209.76 --> 9214.62
voluntary and I'm not even

9211.859 --> 9216.56
State controlled or whatever where you

9214.62 --> 9220.02
could just have screens everywhere

9216.56 --> 9222.72
because they would be everywhere

9220.02 --> 9224.939
and you can literally like oh I need to

9222.72 --> 9226.08
make a call you just put your hand over

9224.939 --> 9228.960000000001
the screen

9226.08 --> 9231.3
and then blink it logs in and you

9228.96 --> 9233.46
suddenly have a full computer screen in

9231.3 --> 9235.319
front of you which you can use to do all

9233.46 --> 9237.479
kinds of things right why would you

9235.319 --> 9239.66
carry a computer or a stupid screen with

9237.479 --> 9243.0
you that can break that you can fall

9239.66 --> 9244.5
accidentally fall in the river

9243.0 --> 9246.84
when you can just have screens

9244.5 --> 9250.74
everywhere and you just do ping log in

9246.84 --> 9253.08
with everything you got just there

9250.74 --> 9255.96
you can never lose that because it's

9253.08 --> 9258.78
like in your hand I mean

9255.96 --> 9260.039999999999
your back of the Beast not mark of the

9258.78 --> 9265.28
beast just

9260.04 --> 9265.28
technology that's not like government

9265.859 --> 9269.78
right

9267.6 --> 9269.78
foreign

9274.38 --> 9278.519999999999
it's gonna be a lot more environmentally

9276.359 --> 9280.380000000001
friendly right I mean you think that all

9278.52 --> 9282.0
these [ __ ] touch screens with all

9280.38 --> 9284.399
that stuff in there

9282.0 --> 9285.66
all millions and millions of these

9284.399 --> 9286.92
things do you think that's good for the

9285.66 --> 9290.039999999999
environment

9286.92 --> 9292.26
if you just have set screens

9290.04 --> 9295.2
that are like installed that

9292.26 --> 9298.02
they're not gonna break as easy

9295.2 --> 9300.359
and then millions of people can

9298.02 --> 9302.28
technically use those same screens or

9300.359 --> 9303.960000000001
wherever they're at they use the screen

9302.28 --> 9305.819000000001
that's there

9303.96 --> 9308.819
yeah

9305.819 --> 9311.399
it'll save you from carrying that [ __ ]

9308.819 --> 9315.3
with you you can't get robbed of it it's

9311.399 --> 9317.58
not gonna break oh my screen broke again

9315.3 --> 9318.66
right

9317.58 --> 9321.12
and it's going to be more

9318.66 --> 9323.28
environmentally friendly so that is

9321.12 --> 9326.58
probably going to be the future not that

9323.28 --> 9329.16
I've visually seen that in my vision

9326.58 --> 9332.899
but it's a good guesstimation as to

9329.16 --> 9332.899
where it's going to go on the long run

9336.5 --> 9343.319
not a little Rod hologram no

9340.92 --> 9346.02
no you're not dude you're not gonna have

9343.319 --> 9349.199999999999
a [ __ ] hologram generator in your arm

9346.02 --> 9352.560000000001
okay that means like a battery

9349.2 --> 9354.060000000001
that means risky stuff

9352.56 --> 9358.56
no

9354.06 --> 9361.619999999999
you just have a like a data chip

9358.56 --> 9365.46
and like a sort of interface thingy and

9361.62 --> 9367.740000000002
then the screen is gonna do the rest you

9365.46 --> 9371.32
just log in clean

9367.74 --> 9374.889
and then the screen does the rest

9371.32 --> 9374.889
[Music]

9384.18 --> 9387.960000000001
little Rod you can put it yeah but you

9386.1 --> 9389.939
can lose a little thing in your pocket

9387.96 --> 9392.938999999998
that's the point oh it's smaller yeah

9389.939 --> 9395.28
that means you're gonna lose it

9392.939 --> 9397.68
no

9395.28 --> 9400.26
so unless it's a little raw that you can

9397.68 --> 9402.979000000001
put on your keychain or something that

9400.26 --> 9402.979
might work too

9404.1 --> 9408.84
but my point is is that it's a good

9406.319 --> 9412.859
chance that eventually

9408.84 --> 9414.78
the idea of individual screens that you

9412.859 --> 9417.380000000001
carry with you everywhere that that's

9414.78 --> 9417.380000000001
gonna stop

9417.42 --> 9421.14
and that is more decentralized

9419.76 --> 9423.06
interfacing

9421.14 --> 9425.539999999999
it's like no that's just these screens

9423.06 --> 9425.539999999999
everywhere

9425.76 --> 9430.56
and it would also get to the point where

9427.92 --> 9433.38
basically you could have a PC

9430.56 --> 9436.26
with a login interface for such a thing

9433.38 --> 9439.259999999998
is like oh PC cling oh you're now logged

9436.26 --> 9442.28
in with your phone on your PC

9439.26 --> 9442.28
right like that

9446.34 --> 9449.64
yeah I think a whole bunch of Mark of

9447.96 --> 9451.438999999998
the Beast people are now squirting

9449.64 --> 9454.58
saying that I'm a shield for the devil

9451.439 --> 9454.58
or something but I mean

9454.859 --> 9461.899000000001
technology you know

9457.92 --> 9461.899
we they have the internet already

9465.3 --> 9469.819
it doesn't necessarily have to be bad

9470.939 --> 9476.220000000001
right

9472.8 --> 9479.099999999999
it's all about hosing control

9476.22 --> 9481.56
are the people in control

9479.1 --> 9484.140000000001
or are they sheepling control

9481.56 --> 9486.24
which means that those that control the

9484.14 --> 9488.46
shipo are in control and they treat

9486.24 --> 9491.64
everybody like shipo which is not gonna

9488.46 --> 9493.919999999998
be a good end result yeah

9491.64 --> 9495.539999999999
those people are in power yeah that I

9493.92 --> 9497.88
definitely don't want some [ __ ]

9495.54 --> 9499.859
implant in my hand

9497.88 --> 9501.479
to do that

9499.859 --> 9503.7
because it's like who's [ __ ] around

9501.479 --> 9505.619999999999
with it can I even trust the people that

9503.7 --> 9509.28
are implanting that right

9505.62 --> 9511.380000000001
but if there's not [ __ ] up Nazis that

9509.28 --> 9513.66
are trying to secretly exterminate

9511.38 --> 9516.358999999999
everybody or overtly exterminate

9513.66 --> 9518.22
everybody bragging about it as long as

9516.359 --> 9521.1
they're not in control well then I'd be

9518.22 --> 9523.92
like well maybe maybe it's that good

9521.1 --> 9526.5
worker why not

9523.92 --> 9528.12
right as long as I could get it out

9526.5 --> 9529.68
again

9528.12 --> 9531.660000000002
I mean if you're gonna have some thing

9529.68 --> 9533.7
in your skin

9531.66 --> 9535.979
then it would be cool if you could just

9533.7 --> 9538.740000000002
like okay I want rid of this one and you

9535.979 --> 9541.92
just make a little cut and yeah and you

9538.74 --> 9544.34
just get it out done

9541.92 --> 9544.34
right

9544.68 --> 9548.960000000001
I mean shouldn't be that difficult

9558.42 --> 9562.7
nobody quitting up for implants

9563.64 --> 9567.599999999999
well

9564.96 --> 9570.66
unless your freaking phone just keeps

9567.6 --> 9572.7
breaking every month and you cost you a

9570.66 --> 9574.8
huge amount of money to get the new one

9572.7 --> 9577.2
again

9574.8 --> 9579.599999999999
and then eventually people you're like

9577.2 --> 9583.26
yeah or I could just do one implant and

9579.6 --> 9586.74
then the devices with which I interface

9583.26 --> 9589.08
will update for me because I no longer

9586.74 --> 9590.46
have to buy a new phone it's gonna be

9589.08 --> 9594.319
done

9590.46 --> 9597.899
with the upgrading of the public systems

9594.319 --> 9600.619999999999
I just have to get the implant one time

9597.899 --> 9600.619999999999
I mean

9603.0 --> 9608.34
it's not gonna even be seen as the big

9605.28 --> 9609.479000000001
issue in the future

9608.34 --> 9611.460000000001
really

9609.479 --> 9614.22
it's only an issue now because there's

9611.46 --> 9617.46
[ __ ] up psychopaths in control

9614.22 --> 9619.56
and we don't want them to have that kind

9617.46 --> 9622.58
of power over us

9619.56 --> 9622.58
that's the reason

9630.0 --> 9635.22
they're near where we are now though

9632.28 --> 9637.5
well the conditions are definitely not

9635.22 --> 9640.56
correct for that I mean with this crazy

9637.5 --> 9642.42
Harari people and all that yeah

9640.56 --> 9644.64
they talk about this kind of thing too

9642.42 --> 9647.1
but purely to mind control you they want

9644.64 --> 9649.199999999999
an implant that literally just destroys

9647.1 --> 9650.58
your conscious it turns you into a

9649.2 --> 9652.740000000002
zombie that'll do whatever they say

9650.58 --> 9656.16
that's what they want yeah

9652.74 --> 9658.319
so with the conditions aren't correct to

9656.16 --> 9660.6
have something like that in a durable

9658.319 --> 9663.6
fashion be implemented

9660.6 --> 9666.960000000001
but if they get out

9663.6 --> 9671.1
we get the WF freaks the Nazis the

9666.96 --> 9673.5
Neo-Nazi Elite if we get them out well

9671.1 --> 9675.66
then it might be more appealing

9673.5 --> 9678.54
to actually try something like that it

9675.66 --> 9680.939
will be more efficient

9678.54 --> 9683.7
cheaper

9680.939 --> 9687.26
less prone to accidents right because

9683.7 --> 9687.26
nobody's gonna lose their phone

9687.6 --> 9690.6
if they have that

9689.28 --> 9694.92
right

9690.6 --> 9696.720000000001
so yeah and again I fall back to

9694.92 --> 9698.58
remember the show where it was in the

9696.72 --> 9700.74
title

9698.58 --> 9703.92
yeah

9700.74 --> 9706.46
let me look it up so I can directly

9703.92 --> 9706.460000000001
quote it

9708.359 --> 9716.18
yeah has wokism deterred Society from

9712.38 --> 9716.179999999998
corrupting faster to technology

9716.58 --> 9725.34
well this wef is very wokeest

9721.859 --> 9727.800000000001
and it is the reason why you're like

9725.34 --> 9732.42
there's no way I'm gonna have a [ __ ]

9727.8 --> 9736.08
hand chip implant right now right why

9732.42 --> 9740.34
because they are there

9736.08 --> 9745.02
if w e f and woke wasn't there you'd

9740.34 --> 9746.399
have like yeah I might try it why not my

9745.02 --> 9749.42
neighbor's doing it and seemed pretty

9746.399 --> 9749.42
cool like see

9750.66 --> 9754.979
it's objectionable now because they're

9753.06 --> 9759.24
really [ __ ] evil people in control

9754.979 --> 9761.519999999999
that will absolutely abuse a

9759.24 --> 9763.939
technological application like that if

9761.52 --> 9763.939
they could

9764.76 --> 9769.380000000001
yeah

9766.02 --> 9771.24
I mean that seems logical right

9769.38 --> 9774.119999999999
you're definitely not gonna do it with

9771.24 --> 9776.52
these freaks in power

9774.12 --> 9778.800000000001
but maybe in the future when they're

9776.52 --> 9781.08
when they're gone and they're like

9778.8 --> 9781.8
they got executed and the rest is in

9781.08 --> 9784.979
jail

9781.8 --> 9786.72
well then then people will be like yeah

9784.979 --> 9790.438999999998
well

9786.72 --> 9793.858999999999
big Danger's gone so yeah we could try

9790.439 --> 9796.7
it and I mean yeah if it goes wrong I'm

9793.859 --> 9796.7
just gonna remove it

9800.58 --> 9807.08
the implants are objectionable no matter

9803.399 --> 9807.08
who they are okay

9807.42 --> 9812.04
fine

9809.399 --> 9812.819
I'm not a fan of implants either but I

9812.04 --> 9816.240000000002
mean

9812.819 --> 9818.819
I'm just seeing that

9816.24 --> 9821.1
I'd rather have an implant than being

9818.819 --> 9823.8
forced to [ __ ] carry around a stupid

9821.1 --> 9827.52
iPhone or something

9823.8 --> 9830.64
I hate those things I hate the interface

9827.52 --> 9833.640000000001
I hate the feeling it gives me when I

9830.64 --> 9837.119999999999
have to use the freaking touch screen I

9833.64 --> 9840.899
can feel that it hurts it actually hurts

9837.12 --> 9843.660000000002
I hate those things it's like every time

9840.899 --> 9845.519999999999
they use them they literally suck off a

9843.66 --> 9848.34
percentage of your spirit out of your

9845.52 --> 9850.979000000001
body I could just feel like the spirit

9848.34 --> 9854.399
is just leeching off every time I use

9850.979 --> 9855.358999999999
those [ __ ] touch screens every time I

9854.399 --> 9858.779999999999
feel it

9855.359 --> 9861.899000000001
I hate those phones

9858.78 --> 9863.939
yeah I'd much rather have an implant if

9861.899 --> 9866.46
I had no other choice I had to have some

9863.939 --> 9868.800000000001
kind of thing like that with me

9866.46 --> 9870.119999999999
right but right now I'll settle for

9868.8 --> 9872.039999999999
neither

9870.12 --> 9874.979000000001
I just have a regular stupid

9872.04 --> 9877.080000000002
internetless phone

9874.979 --> 9879.72
which I can call

9877.08 --> 9881.16
and receive and send text messages and

9879.72 --> 9883.26
that's good enough for me and I never

9881.16 --> 9884.819
take my phone with me out there unless I

9883.26 --> 9888.12
really need it

9884.819 --> 9891.24
because I'm going to some new place

9888.12 --> 9892.800000000001
I need to come be able to contact

9891.24 --> 9895.14
the person

9892.8 --> 9897.24
where I'm going to

9895.14 --> 9899.539999999999
but other other than that I never take

9897.24 --> 9900.96
my phone with me ever

9899.54 --> 9903.359
[Music]

9900.96 --> 9904.619999999999
put it in your head no not put it in

9903.359 --> 9907.16
your head

9904.62 --> 9907.160000000002
God

9908.58 --> 9911.18
Jesus

9913.5 --> 9922.14
no I look if I'm gonna have an implant

9916.62 --> 9925.08
hand or arm never in your head never

9922.14 --> 9928.039999999999
what the [ __ ] man

9925.08 --> 9928.039999999999
never

9937.02 --> 9941.76
yeah sure Dr Bass awkward I mean I'm

9939.96 --> 9943.919999999998
sure that they've done all kinds of

9941.76 --> 9945.84
medical experimentation that's why I

9943.92 --> 9948.479
call it the medical experimentation of

9945.84 --> 9951.3
2020 2021

9948.479 --> 9953.279999999999
because that's exactly what they did all

9951.3 --> 9956.039999999999
kinds of new development in a whole new

9953.28 --> 9957.54
field and I thought well we want to test

9956.04 --> 9960.84
all this but

9957.54 --> 9962.580000000002
the animal tests are not really having a

9960.84 --> 9965.34
great result other than all of it is

9962.58 --> 9968.34
dying people are probably not going to

9965.34 --> 9970.979
line up to help us test this voluntarily

9968.34 --> 9973.74
for money so let's just [ __ ] the public

9970.979 --> 9975.779999999999
over and and force everybody to take it

9973.74 --> 9978.18
because of panic

9975.78 --> 9979.439
and that's what they did it's just a

9978.18 --> 9981.06
massive

9979.439 --> 9984.56
public

9981.06 --> 9984.56
medical trial

9985.439 --> 9990.06
that they forced everybody to pay for

9987.78 --> 9991.92
with tax dollars

9990.06 --> 9994.8
tax money

9991.92 --> 9997.2
to engage so they didn't get paid to be

9994.8 --> 10002.679999999998
voluntary testers everybody was forced

9997.2 --> 10002.68
to pay for involuntarily being tested

10003.92 --> 10008.899
that's the difference in that way they

10006.319 --> 10010.939
kept all the profit

10008.899 --> 10014.24
and they had this this full range of

10010.939 --> 10016.52
testing they tested so much and it's all

10014.24 --> 10018.5
public I mean

10016.52 --> 10020.899000000001
hold over from that situation well in

10018.5 --> 10023.479
Nazi Germany their medical testing at

10020.899 --> 10026.539999999999
least they did that in secret they had

10023.479 --> 10029.179999999998
the like the foresight to know like yeah

10026.54 --> 10031.580000000002
this is not gonna be this is not gonna

10029.18 --> 10034.7
look good when they find out they we did

10031.58 --> 10038.18
this yeah these [ __ ] freaks they've

10034.7 --> 10040.399000000001
just done it all in public

10038.18 --> 10042.319
and they're they're doing it all in

10040.399 --> 10044.779999999999
public hoping that they can just

10042.319 --> 10046.939
literally Gaslight their way through the

10044.78 --> 10048.62
entire thing and make people just accept

10046.939 --> 10050.84
it afterward

10048.62 --> 10053.6
it's so [ __ ] up

10050.84 --> 10056.18
it's way worse than what the Nazis did

10053.6 --> 10058.819
guys way worse

10056.18 --> 10061.479000000001
Nazis never had this level of hutzpah

10058.819 --> 10061.479
never

10066.16 --> 10071.899
with the entire world yes

10069.5 --> 10073.939
well they'd only have one opportunity to

10071.899 --> 10077.019999999999
do it so this is when they did it oh my

10073.939 --> 10079.58
God they'll still go

10077.02 --> 10082.819000000001
just went live with another [ __ ]

10079.58 --> 10086.2
downward acceleration [ __ ]

10082.819 --> 10089.619999999999
it's more rambling about nonsense

10086.2 --> 10089.62
Narnia Magic

10090.319 --> 10094.64
so yeah

10091.88 --> 10096.5
who cares I'm still going here

10094.64 --> 10098.92
I'm going for the three hour stream

10096.5 --> 10098.92
today

10101.1 --> 10104.169
[Music]

10114.2 --> 10119.439
yep

10115.64 --> 10119.439
medical and NASA that's right

10122.06 --> 10126.68
normalizing people dropping dead it's so

10124.819 --> 10130.519999999999
[ __ ] yeah but that's because

10126.68 --> 10132.74
that's just that's the expected result

10130.52 --> 10134.54
I think that in a lot of I think that

10132.74 --> 10137.479
part of the test might not even be like

10134.54 --> 10140.12
to test whether people will die but just

10137.479 --> 10141.8
to see how they would die

10140.12 --> 10145.160000000002
I think that this medical

10141.8 --> 10147.14
experimentation is actually to see how

10145.16 --> 10150.68
people would die

10147.14 --> 10152.72
how fast how much they would need

10150.68 --> 10154.220000000001
I think that that's actually been the

10152.72 --> 10156.74
test

10154.22 --> 10159.08
not even to see what it would do but

10156.74 --> 10160.88
just how people would die from it I

10159.08 --> 10162.5
think that that's the actual testing

10160.88 --> 10165.019999999999
which is

10162.5 --> 10167.319
about as satanic as you could possibly

10165.02 --> 10167.319000000001
imagine

10180.8 --> 10184.3
it should be done with them

10189.8 --> 10194.66
no

10191.96 --> 10198.699999999999
I don't think anything needs to be done

10194.66 --> 10198.7
to them except for execution

10198.8 --> 10201.819
I mean just

10202.28 --> 10205.12
I don't know

10207.2 --> 10211.880000000001
I'm not gonna say how or I'm not gonna

10210.2 --> 10213.979000000001
get into that

10211.88 --> 10216.319
but I don't think we should do anything

10213.979 --> 10218.119999999999
that they're trying to do on us in

10216.319 --> 10219.68
return that would make us just as

10218.12 --> 10222.08
terrible

10219.68 --> 10225.02
but I think that they do

10222.08 --> 10227.24
require a trial and that there should

10225.02 --> 10229.6
definitely be a death penalty among the

10227.24 --> 10229.6
options

10239.479 --> 10243.319
their population reduction should start

10242.12 --> 10245.720000000001
with it yeah but that's never gonna

10243.319 --> 10248.18
happen because they don't see themselves

10245.72 --> 10249.619999999999
as population they see themselves as a

10248.18 --> 10253.04
superior being

10249.62 --> 10256.240000000002
that does not require culling

10253.04 --> 10259.720000000001
only the useless eater sheep population

10256.24 --> 10263.74
required calling according to this

10259.72 --> 10263.74
Neo-Nazi imperialist system

10264.02 --> 10268.640000000001
so they're never gonna start with

10266.54 --> 10272.42
themselves because they don't require

10268.64 --> 10274.099999999999
calling according to them it's the

10272.42 --> 10276.62
stupid people

10274.1 --> 10278.479000000001
that don't join them that require it and

10276.62 --> 10280.76
sometimes even the people that you join

10278.479 --> 10282.319
them because they're they're just trying

10280.76 --> 10283.939
to be with the winner they don't care

10282.319 --> 10285.979
about the people that are just trying to

10283.939 --> 10288.56
be with the winner at all they see them

10285.979 --> 10291.019999999999
just as much as sheep

10288.56 --> 10292.76
it's just a cooperating sheep but they

10291.02 --> 10295.819000000001
they don't care if those people get

10292.76 --> 10298.34
killed too now you're with them and with

10295.819 --> 10300.199999999999
them fully if you're just cooperating

10298.34 --> 10302.6
with them they're you're just as much

10300.2 --> 10303.859
the enemy as the people they overtly

10302.6 --> 10306.26
Target

10303.859 --> 10308.78
that's how they operate

10306.26 --> 10310.1
you have to be really on the inside to

10308.78 --> 10312.560000000001
actually

10310.1 --> 10315.220000000001
be off the kill list

10312.56 --> 10315.22
for them

10323.92 --> 10327.03
[Music]

10332.18 --> 10336.16
if you cut and fold you will be

10336.92 --> 10341.74
[ __ ] [ __ ] cold

10342.62 --> 10345.640000000001
that's interesting

10346.46 --> 10353.319
semantically wise

10348.08 --> 10353.319
[ __ ] and full it will be [ __ ] and cold

10356.66 --> 10365.0
right

10358.53 --> 10365.0
[Music]

10370.64 --> 10376.96
yeah that's a very aesthetically

10372.439 --> 10376.960000000001
pleasing sentence there Dr baz awkward

10378.62 --> 10380.740000000002
okay

10381.439 --> 10390.439
I was manually as bad as they say yeah

10386.72 --> 10392.84
I mean he did like surgical testing on

10390.439 --> 10396.380000000001
people like there were animals

10392.84 --> 10400.279
in ways that if we treated animals like

10396.38 --> 10403.278999999999
how he treated person people back then

10400.279 --> 10406.1
If he if animals would be treated like

10403.279 --> 10408.560000000001
that now it would be illegal

10406.1 --> 10409.899000000001
as a medical experimentation okay yeah

10408.56 --> 10413.539999999999
and he

10409.899 --> 10416.42
experimented on people to that level

10413.54 --> 10418.880000000001
yeah it was really horrendous he

10416.42 --> 10421.460000000001
literally like amputated

10418.88 --> 10423.438999999998
body parts or entire heads from people

10421.46 --> 10424.938999999998
just to see if they'd survive if they

10423.439 --> 10427.899
could serve that kind of thing dude it

10424.939 --> 10427.899
was horrendous

10428.439 --> 10436.479000000001
like unimaginably horrendous things

10434.0 --> 10436.479
okay

10440.18 --> 10447.2
like things you don't want to know you

10444.38 --> 10450.319
literally don't want to look into it

10447.2 --> 10453.380000000001
bump into it and then remember that

10450.319 --> 10456.019999999999
don't do that you don't want to know

10453.38 --> 10458.899
trust me on this

10456.02 --> 10461.720000000001
I'm very glad that I forgot the more

10458.899 --> 10462.858999999999
horrific details I'm very glad that I

10461.72 --> 10466.179999999998
forgot

10462.859 --> 10466.18
you don't want to know

10470.0 --> 10473.61
[Music]

10478.04 --> 10482.54
[Music]

10480.5 --> 10484.88
right but I mean even if you look at

10482.54 --> 10486.439
Pavlov he already did pretty horrible

10484.88 --> 10488.06
things

10486.439 --> 10490.7
right

10488.06 --> 10492.8
and that wasn't even like a German and

10490.7 --> 10494.54
Nazi German or anything it wasn't even

10492.8 --> 10498.319
during that time

10494.54 --> 10502.279
right and Pavlov did already very

10498.319 --> 10503.778999999999
horrible things like torture things just

10502.279 --> 10506.319000000001
to see

10503.779 --> 10506.319000000001
right

10506.479 --> 10512.24
now imagine that sort of thing but with

10508.46 --> 10514.88
people that would not be far off

10512.24 --> 10515.96
and then take it a couple of steps

10514.88 --> 10518.179999999998
further

10515.96 --> 10520.96
and that's where you want to stop

10518.18 --> 10520.960000000001
thinking about it

10522.14 --> 10525.92
yeah but even if you just look at what

10524.18 --> 10528.439
Pavlov did

10525.92 --> 10530.960000000001
in the entire Library you'll read things

10528.439 --> 10534.14
that will literally make you throw up

10530.96 --> 10537.14
it's so horrible

10534.14 --> 10540.46
and that was Pavlov

10537.14 --> 10540.46
and it's not even Mangler

10543.979 --> 10549.74
you never heard of Pavlov what are you

10547.04 --> 10553.04
serious Richard G is the most famous

10549.74 --> 10556.58
pathologist in the world pretty much you

10553.04 --> 10558.859
had invented Pavlov's dog right the

10556.58 --> 10561.039999999999
trick the association trick you ring the

10558.859 --> 10561.04
bell

10561.5 --> 10565.88
and give the dog food and then

10564.02 --> 10567.5
eventually you don't have to bring him

10565.88 --> 10569.119999999999
the food you just ring the bell he

10567.5 --> 10571.58
starts salivating because he's

10569.12 --> 10573.2
anticipating on a biological

10571.58 --> 10577.34
subconscious level that he's going to

10573.2 --> 10580.6
get food that's Pavlov invented that

10577.34 --> 10580.6
pavlovian art

10581.359 --> 10588.319
he invented that but he did that among

10585.56 --> 10591.56
like that's only one of the more

10588.319 --> 10594.92
friendly type things that he figured out

10591.56 --> 10598.399
yeah because he tested those types of

10594.92 --> 10601.460000000001
tricks up to torture up to literal

10598.399 --> 10602.599999999999
electrocution torture and [ __ ] it's so

10601.46 --> 10605.0
[ __ ] up

10602.6 --> 10608.859
he did such [ __ ] up things it's

10605.0 --> 10608.859
unbelievable you don't want to know

10609.5 --> 10613.0
and that's just Pavlov

10617.66 --> 10623.899
operant condition yes but he invented

10621.02 --> 10626.54
all that he figured that out those basic

10623.899 --> 10628.519999999999
biological mechanisms for social

10626.54 --> 10631.580000000002
engineering that's Pavlov he invented

10628.52 --> 10634.640000000001
all of that he developed all of it

10631.58 --> 10636.14
and that's before Manila yeah Mengele

10634.64 --> 10639.38
was later

10636.14 --> 10642.14
so you can imagine that mangala lent a

10639.38 --> 10645.858999999999
lot of inspiration including the

10642.14 --> 10647.96
horrible parts from Pavlov

10645.859 --> 10651.819
you basically continued Pavlov's

10647.96 --> 10651.819
research in but with humans

10654.74 --> 10660.92
don't just anyway maybe you're gonna

10658.04 --> 10661.67
look into it anyway you'll be sorry you

10660.92 --> 10664.04
will be

10661.67 --> 10666.38
[Music]

10664.04 --> 10669.1
I remember it well enough to not look

10666.38 --> 10669.099999999999
into that again

10670.279 --> 10675.08
it's good when you remember this is too

10672.979 --> 10677.358999999999
horrific but you don't remember exactly

10675.08 --> 10678.92
why in order to have it unleash a

10677.359 --> 10681.140000000001
nightmare just by thinking about it it's

10678.92 --> 10684.02
really good position to be in and I'm

10681.14 --> 10687.048999999999
not gonna alter that position

10684.02 --> 10687.049
[Music]

10690.26 --> 10694.880000000001
all right anyway I think I'm gonna round

10692.72 --> 10697.519999999999
out the show

10694.88 --> 10700.24
almost at least hitting the three hour

10697.52 --> 10700.24
mark soon

10701.96 --> 10705.679999999998
man this has been elaborate pretty good

10704.72 --> 10708.019999999999
show

10705.68 --> 10711.2
lots of subjects

10708.02 --> 10714.380000000001
the no practice no Jew seems like almost

10711.2 --> 10717.2
kind of incomplete title so I think I'm

10714.38 --> 10719.858999999999
gonna add something to that long show

10717.2 --> 10719.859
today yes

10722.02 --> 10726.399000000001
I don't want to know about that thanks

Vision Dark World references I'm not

10799.22 --> 10803.72
gonna put mangle in the title too that's

10801.5 --> 10807.08
a little bit much now practice no Jew

10803.72 --> 10810.08
and then the mangle or two that's

10807.08 --> 10814.0
even though it's been a substantial part

10810.08 --> 10814.0
of the last part of the show

10823.42 --> 10828.08
Mandela garbage last yeah yeah Dr best

10826.279 --> 10830.18
record yeah

10828.08 --> 10831.81
that's a while ago by the way so yeah

10830.18 --> 10835.02
welcome back

10831.81 --> 10835.019999999999
[Music]

10836.479 --> 10841.88
yeah the Mandela isn't changing

10839.3 --> 10848.358999999999
I mean everything I've said about it

10841.88 --> 10850.099999999999
absolutely stands 100 I'm 100 right no

10848.359 --> 10852.140000000001
exception

10850.1 --> 10854.0
yeah not even Quantum of conscious is

10852.14 --> 10858.26
going to pull me away from that

10854.0 --> 10860.3
like I am 100 correct exactly in detail

10858.26 --> 10863.42
as to what happens with the Mandela

10860.3 --> 10867.38
effect exactly and have literal memories

10863.42 --> 10869.18
from it happening immediately yeah I

10867.38 --> 10872.66
remember still

10869.18 --> 10874.939
when I first saw Star Wars uh five

10872.66 --> 10876.68
Empire Strikes Back the

10874.939 --> 10878.779
like Luke

10876.68 --> 10881.779
oh I am your father which he didn't say

10878.779 --> 10884.479000000001
he said no I am your father but when I

10881.779 --> 10887.42
first saw that movie that night

10884.479 --> 10889.16
the same day after I first saw that I

10887.42 --> 10891.08
went to my brother was a real big Star

10889.16 --> 10893.96
Wars fan and I told him like wow that

10891.08 --> 10896.96
moment with Luke I am your father and he

10893.96 --> 10899.899
immediately got pissed off it's like no

10896.96 --> 10902.479
it's not Luke I am your father it's no I

10899.899 --> 10905.06
am your father like he knew it he knew

10902.479 --> 10907.58
it immediately it's just weird because

10905.06 --> 10909.319
apparently that mistake that sort of

10907.58 --> 10911.66
Mandela effect before it was called the

10909.319 --> 10914.72
Mandela effect was already out there

10911.66 --> 10917.74
enough for him to know that what I was

10914.72 --> 10917.74
saying was a mistake

10917.96 --> 10926.539999999999
so I had that Mandela effect

10921.52 --> 10931.220000000001
immediately like within 12 hours after I

10926.54 --> 10934.7
had first seen it yeah that means it is

10931.22 --> 10936.438999999998
purely psychological and it is the

10934.7 --> 10938.479000000001
aesthetic sense

10936.439 --> 10942.68
it corrects

10938.479 --> 10944.119999999999
what you're seeing into what you feel it

10942.68 --> 10945.92
must be

10944.12 --> 10948.08
because it would be aesthetically better

10945.92 --> 10951.08
it would be more perfect more memorable

10948.08 --> 10953.12
and that how that works aesthetic sense

10951.08 --> 10957.439
how the aesthetic sense corrects things

10953.12 --> 10960.26
in the mind is exactly identical with

10957.439 --> 10964.279
every single person in the world

10960.26 --> 10967.64
the aesthetic sense Works Universal it's

10964.279 --> 10971.0
exactly the same with everybody

10967.64 --> 10973.76
now it might trigger or not trigger but

10971.0 --> 10978.38
if it triggers it triggers in exactly

10973.76 --> 10979.12
the same way with every single person in

10978.38 --> 10980.899
the world

10979.12 --> 10983.660000000002
[Music]

10980.899 --> 10986.979
yeah nobody comes in like wait no the

10983.66 --> 10990.92
Mandela you got it wrong it shouldn't be

10986.979 --> 10994.938999999998
Berenstein Bears it should be barren

10990.92 --> 10997.76
Stone bears not Berenstain Bears it

10994.939 --> 11001.54
should be Baron Stone Bears no it's

10997.76 --> 11003.76
Berenstain Bears steam because that's

11001.54 --> 11005.380000000001
like the general Steen thing is a lot of

11003.76 --> 11007.54
people with Steen in their name that's

11005.38 --> 11010.0
how everybody remembers it immediately

11007.54 --> 11013.5
that's how everybody wants to read it

11010.0 --> 11013.5
immediately when it came out

11015.88 --> 11022.539999999999
aesthetic sense is universal everybody

11018.76 --> 11025.960000000001
has exactly the same aesthetic sense

11022.54 --> 11029.62
that's why everybody remem misremembers

11025.96 --> 11031.96
these things exactly the same or you

11029.62 --> 11034.720000000001
don't when it's turned on you remember

11031.96 --> 11038.14
it identical to everybody else that has

11034.72 --> 11039.938999999998
it turned on incorrectly remember it the

11038.14 --> 11042.278999999999
aesthetically pleasing

11039.939 --> 11043.960000000001
outcome that should be is what you'll

11042.279 --> 11045.7
remember and it will be the same with

11043.96 --> 11046.839999999998
everybody else that has that sense

11045.7 --> 11049.899000000001
triggered

11046.84 --> 11052.72
that's what's going on that's real

11049.899 --> 11054.699999999999
I guarantee it Our Winning guarantee

11052.72 --> 11056.38
anyway

11054.7 --> 11058.479000000001
didn't want to bring up an entire new

11056.38 --> 11060.819
subject but you brought it up so I just

11058.479 --> 11064.539999999999
filled it in

11060.819 --> 11066.1
Miss memory but miss memory is it's not

11064.54 --> 11069.880000000001
just Mis memory

11066.1 --> 11073.66
it's an a specific effect

11069.88 --> 11076.56
that happens I describe what exactly

11073.66 --> 11080.02
happens in detail it's the aesthetic

11076.56 --> 11083.56
correcting memory

11080.02 --> 11085.42
you see something you feel it could be

11083.56 --> 11087.819
better

11085.42 --> 11089.979
how you feel it could be better will be

11087.819 --> 11091.72
the same as anybody else that has the

11089.979 --> 11095.199999999999
same sense they will all feel it would

11091.72 --> 11097.72
be better in that one specific way

11095.2 --> 11100.479000000001
and then

11097.72 --> 11102.64
if it's like

11100.479 --> 11105.3
just one little thing it'll slip back in

11102.64 --> 11109.119999999999
the background and then your memory

11105.3 --> 11111.06
remembers the aesthetically corrected

11109.12 --> 11115.060000000001
version

11111.06 --> 11117.519999999999
that's the Mandela effect

11115.06 --> 11120.039999999999
that is exactly what it is and that's

11117.52 --> 11124.380000000001
what it is every single time no

11120.04 --> 11124.380000000001
exception there's no exception to this

11126.34 --> 11132.64
the way people

11129.12 --> 11135.399000000001
misremember things is always the same

11132.64 --> 11138.278999999999
because it's based on some specific

11135.399 --> 11142.5
effect it's not just a random Mis memory

11138.279 --> 11146.08
no it's an Aesthetics based

11142.5 --> 11148.899
misremembering yeah you never have like

11146.08 --> 11150.399
oh man yeah I had this series that was a

11148.899 --> 11153.399
real big fan of

11150.399 --> 11155.8
and it had this ugly name and now they

11153.399 --> 11157.119999999999
improved it they corrected it this is

11155.8 --> 11158.56
all wrong

11157.12 --> 11161.140000000001
no

11158.56 --> 11163.3
like why why do everybody why does

11161.14 --> 11165.519999999999
everybody call it Berenstain Bears when

11163.3 --> 11168.039999999999
of course it's Baron stain Bears yeah

11165.52 --> 11171.16
it's stupid it's ugly it's sustained but

11168.04 --> 11174.04
that's how it is called no people don't

11171.16 --> 11175.359
remember it with in that way

11174.04 --> 11179.439
because

11175.359 --> 11182.62
the memory corrects things like that to

11179.439 --> 11186.1
be more aesthetic it always improves

11182.62 --> 11188.5
something that is perceived or felt as

11186.1 --> 11191.319
ugly into something that is better

11188.5 --> 11194.319
it's an aesthetic memory effect nobody

11191.319 --> 11197.8
has like why is this near name all

11194.319 --> 11200.859
corrected it should be wrong why isn't

11197.8 --> 11204.34
this wrong no no Mandela effect why that

11200.859 --> 11207.399000000001
exists it's always like why is it so

11204.34 --> 11208.779
ugly it should be this no it was always

11207.399 --> 11211.84
this ugly

11208.779 --> 11214.12
and upon first confrontation your mind

11211.84 --> 11216.16
corrected it for you and then you just

11214.12 --> 11218.68
assumed the corrected version in your

11216.16 --> 11221.14
mind like everybody else that has that

11218.68 --> 11225.479000000001
and that's what happened exactly what

11221.14 --> 11225.479
happened every single time no exception

11228.16 --> 11233.08
yeah because nobody

11230.38 --> 11235.06
like misremembers

11233.08 --> 11236.34
oh but I thought the name was really

11235.06 --> 11239.619999999999
stupid

11236.34 --> 11241.899
I remember it being so stupid no no

11239.62 --> 11244.779
everybody's like wait why is it ugly it

11241.899 --> 11248.14
should be this is wrong it's not never

11244.779 --> 11250.6
like oh why is this improved it should

11248.14 --> 11253.539999999999
be incorrect it was always ugly I always

11250.6 --> 11255.58
remember how this was ugly the name and

11253.54 --> 11258.34
now it's all corrected how it should be

11255.58 --> 11261.16
oh oh you're already saying it how it

11258.34 --> 11264.7
should be what is this how it should be

11261.16 --> 11266.619999999999
is that how it should be is like no how

11264.7 --> 11271.240000000002
I remember it or is it

11266.62 --> 11273.819000000001
how it should be aesthetically

11271.24 --> 11275.92
can you tell as you're saying it can you

11273.819 --> 11279.1
tell which one that really is when you

11275.92 --> 11281.02
say it how it should be yeah

11279.1 --> 11283.42
I think that when people say how it

11281.02 --> 11286.359
should be they're actually speaking for

11283.42 --> 11290.64
their aesthetic mind and not their

11286.359 --> 11290.640000000001
actual mind and they don't realize it

11292.06 --> 11296.5
sorry you shouldn't have said anything

11293.56 --> 11299.019999999999
about yeah but I did you did and now I

11296.5 --> 11301.0
roll it out again as I have many times

11299.02 --> 11304.12
and I will in the future because this is

11301.0 --> 11308.859
the Mandela effect no exception no

11304.12 --> 11312.060000000001
exception no exception no exception

11308.859 --> 11312.06
no exception

11312.279 --> 11317.800000000001
the aesthetic mind corrects a lot of

11315.1 --> 11320.380000000001
things in your life because there's a

11317.8 --> 11322.479
lot of [ __ ] up and unnecessarily ugly

11320.38 --> 11325.539999999999
things that are getting shoved in your

11322.479 --> 11327.64
face on purpose to [ __ ] with you

11325.54 --> 11331.720000000001
we need our aesthetic memory for

11327.64 --> 11335.819
survival to deal with this vile demon

11331.72 --> 11335.819
infested world of ugliness

11336.88 --> 11343.72
that's why we have it for survival

11340.84 --> 11347.460000000001
but things are not as aesthetically

11343.72 --> 11347.46
perfected as you remember them

11347.62 --> 11353.380000000001
that aesthetically perfected memory is

11351.04 --> 11354.580000000002
the construct that you needed for

11353.38 --> 11357.64
yourself

11354.58 --> 11359.2
as a lens to see the world in a slightly

11357.64 --> 11363.22
better light

11359.2 --> 11367.380000000001
you needed it to be more perfect for you

11363.22 --> 11372.819
to pull through but in reality it isn't

11367.38 --> 11377.619999999999
it was ugly it was incorrect and some of

11372.819 --> 11379.359
it on purpose just to [ __ ] with you

11377.62 --> 11381.04
you understand

11379.359 --> 11382.66
there's a lot of [ __ ] up people in

11381.04 --> 11384.899000000001
this world and they know what they're

11382.66 --> 11384.899
doing

11386.859 --> 11391.479000000001
make sure that you know it too

11390.18 --> 11394.479000000001
