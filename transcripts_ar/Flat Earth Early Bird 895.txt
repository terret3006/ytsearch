probably gonna be some thunder in the

112.64 --> 116.479
background too

113.52 --> 118.96
at some point but yeah it's really

116.479 --> 122.24
gushing right now

118.96 --> 128.239
careful not to get the webcam

122.24 --> 131.039
lens wet

128.239 --> 133.52
but yeah not not exactly the sunniest of

131.039 --> 133.51999999999998
sundays

136.08 --> 145.12
however today is a good day

142.56 --> 145.12
for me

146.23 --> 152.23899999999998
[Music]

148.959 --> 157.84
right it is sunday the 16th

152.239 --> 157.84
of may 2021

159.36 --> 166.4
got green tea

163.12 --> 168.48000000000002
i got a little celebratory gusto energy

166.4 --> 170.56
drink

168.48 --> 171.51899999999998
good stuff and yeah with the shitty

170.56 --> 175.36
weather i had

171.519 --> 175.36
basically went out for groceries

180.159 --> 187.04
because yesterday i had a

183.84 --> 189.519
really amazing paypal donation from

187.04 --> 189.519
somebody

189.76 --> 193.44
that i had not expected

194.48 --> 200.79999999999998
uh i have seen him in chat so uh let me

198.08 --> 200.8
what is it again

202.8 --> 211.28
it was will

206.239 --> 213.92000000000002
billions of bill williams uh

211.28 --> 214.879
let me check it out he's been here in

213.92 --> 218.92
chat

214.879 --> 222.319
but yeah he gave me a mind-blowing

218.92 --> 224.72
316 euros paypal donation which is a new

222.319 --> 224.72
record

224.84 --> 231.84
and well

227.28 --> 235.2
i guess everybody wanted to go for that

231.84 --> 240.0
or the universe did

235.2 --> 245.04
but yeah that certainly solves a whole

240.0 --> 245.04
bunch of issues right now and

248.799 --> 255.36
hold on let me not drift off too much

252.879 --> 258.0
let's just say at a very relaxed day

255.36 --> 258.0
yesterday

265.36 --> 271.759
right will

268.639 --> 271.759
billions yeah

275.52 --> 282.24
that's like the most welcome

278.56 --> 285.36
ever because now suddenly

282.24 --> 285.36
no more nagging

286.8 --> 290.88
and i can definitely uh guarantee that

290.0 --> 294.84
i'm gonna

290.88 --> 297.04
keep the begging at a minimum for a

294.84 --> 300.08
while

297.04 --> 303.12
oh my god right

300.08 --> 305.039
and beside that i rewatched yesterday's

303.12 --> 308.08
show

305.039 --> 308.08
it was pretty good

309.039 --> 314.8
i'm really proud of the level of fractal

312.32 --> 317.039
thinking and even explaining it how i

314.8 --> 319.36
put it down i'm really satisfied with my

317.039 --> 319.36
level

320.96 --> 327.68
i've survived another month yes i have

325.039 --> 327.68
definitely

329.36 --> 333.199
right uh also yesterday om benjamin had

332.96 --> 336.23999999999995
a

333.199 --> 336.24
very interesting

336.8 --> 340.32
very interesting live show

340.88 --> 349.919
again but he was basically

346.32 --> 354.4
entertaining uh other trains of thinking

349.919 --> 357.19899999999996
with christianity and like there's been

354.4 --> 359.44
thoughts about that maybe i'm not saying

357.199 --> 361.68
that i necessarily agree to this

359.44 --> 362.56
but i don't necessarily disagree to it

361.68 --> 365.12
either

362.56 --> 366.319
that maybe christ didn't actually die on

365.12 --> 370.88
the cross

366.319 --> 372.8
ah but that he literally just had the

370.88 --> 374.71999999999997
the knowledge the ability the control

372.8 --> 376.24
over his own spirit that he could keep

374.72 --> 379.36
himself alive in those

376.24 --> 381.759
horrible conditions basically

379.36 --> 384.319
and even simulate his own death so that

381.759 --> 384.319
he would be

384.72 --> 391.44000000000005
basically brought out of the trance

388.0 --> 393.6
after yeah when he was declared dead

391.44 --> 396.96
it i don't know it i've thought of it

393.6 --> 399.03900000000004
before like way back

396.96 --> 400.0
and it is a very interesting like it

399.039 --> 403.12
would actually

400.0 --> 405.84
honor the the might of his skill

403.12 --> 407.28000000000003
and his personal spiritual his yeah his

405.84 --> 409.19899999999996
personal priesthood

407.28 --> 411.75899999999996
that he would be able to do such a thing

409.199 --> 414.08000000000004
is like an unimaginable feat

411.759 --> 416.16
because yeah crucifixion is extremely

414.08 --> 418.15999999999997
torturous

416.16 --> 420.639
and like a huge strain on your nervous

418.16 --> 422.8
system right so

420.639 --> 426.479
it's another way of thinking about it

422.8 --> 426.479
and i found it fascinating

427.28 --> 431.11999999999995
uh so that was great on our own benjamin

430.72 --> 436.319
at

431.12 --> 439.36
tea time with barry and larry mm-hmm

436.319 --> 444.24
uh also i

439.36 --> 449.599
re-updated the the crypto links

444.24 --> 451.52
i now have a a wallet on my desktop

449.599 --> 452.639
didn't go for the harmony one i went for

451.52 --> 454.0
an exit this one

452.639 --> 456.479
because that's the one that my dad

454.0 --> 458.08
recommended i might reconsider that at

456.479 --> 460.8
some point shouldn't be too much hassle

458.08 --> 460.8
to switch it

462.84 --> 465.84
uh

467.039 --> 471.919
oh yeah also watch the cable guy this is

469.68 --> 473.919
rounding out today

471.919 --> 476.79999999999995
and it was weird because the guy had a

473.919 --> 479.919
lot of references

476.8 --> 483.039
like movie references that that he

479.919 --> 487.75899999999996
that's like part of his act and he also

483.039 --> 489.68
had a if you build it he will come

487.759 --> 493.039
thing and that just immediately reminded

489.68 --> 497.759
me of the time when owen benjamin was

493.039 --> 501.199
all getting all riled up about that

497.759 --> 501.199
with the mandelu effect

504.56 --> 508.0
right yeah in the movie cable guy that

506.639 --> 511.599
said one minute

508.0 --> 513.44
15 seconds or one hour 15 minutes 45

511.599 --> 517.039
seconds

513.44 --> 518.8000000000001
when that happens yeah it's it's so odd

517.039 --> 522.159
now like every mandela

518.8 --> 524.56
related hype like you immediately

522.159 --> 526.64
recognize it now

524.56 --> 528.3199999999999
or you hear that it's there when before

526.64 --> 530.0
i've seen the cable guy before and i

528.32 --> 534.32
just didn't care i didn't get the

530.0 --> 537.279
reference i didn't really know the movie

534.32 --> 537.6
or didn't think it was too memorable to

537.279 --> 539.6
me

537.6 --> 541.519
at the time right so it didn't mean

539.6 --> 542.9590000000001
anything but now

541.519 --> 544.88
it's like immediately still kind of

542.959 --> 549.8389999999999
stood out like hey wait

544.88 --> 549.8389999999999
that's that mandela effect thingy

550.48 --> 554.88
you can just have multiple wallets if

552.16 --> 554.88
needed right

555.68 --> 559.5999999999999
that would be nice anyway

561.519 --> 568.72
also yeah some good updates for my gti

565.44 --> 572.08
like some things have been like

568.72 --> 574.24
fixed because

572.08 --> 576.64
and so i might actually get some kind of

574.24 --> 578.16
money out of it sometime soon

576.64 --> 580.8
like the way it's looking i might like

578.16 --> 583.519
even get it out of it next week

580.8 --> 584.24
would be the first withdrawal of some

583.519 --> 588.32
form

584.24 --> 590.32
that i've had in in years now

588.32 --> 592.32
like in at least two years so that's

590.32 --> 596.24
very well well a year

592.32 --> 599.6800000000001
i don't know how long in at least a year

596.24 --> 601.76
so that would be very welcome

599.68 --> 604.079
that they finally fix the crisis

601.76 --> 605.4399999999999
situation which they do admit that they

604.079 --> 607.5999999999999
had

605.44 --> 607.6
just

608.56 --> 614.0
anyway what is gta well i can't

611.6 --> 616.0790000000001
i had to sign an agreement like six

614.0 --> 620.16
pages long

616.079 --> 621.68
like yeah still can't really advertise

620.16 --> 624.399
for it

621.68 --> 625.76
but i haven't really violated those

624.399 --> 629.04
principles

625.76 --> 632.8
but i can't say what it is gti is a

629.04 --> 633.519
company that's very elaborate stuff it

632.8 --> 635.92
has to do

633.519 --> 638.32
with crypto as well but it is kind of

635.92 --> 638.3199999999999
like a

643.68 --> 648.4799999999999
i'm not really in the mood to start

645.2 --> 648.48
explaining the whole thing again

657.6 --> 661.6800000000001
it's something that i've been a part of

659.36 --> 664.95
for years

661.68 --> 667.3599999999999
and i've never had to pay a cent

664.95 --> 668.9590000000001
[Music]

667.36 --> 671.36
all right that was pretty much gift at

668.959 --> 674.959
the base it is so it is bitcoin

671.36 --> 677.839
etf no

674.959 --> 678.88
it is b well b what does that even mean

677.839 --> 683.2
uh

678.88 --> 683.2
it is compatible with bitcoin

684.64 --> 689.36
but it's more like a it's not just a

687.399 --> 692.88
cryptocurrency and oh

689.36 --> 694.5600000000001
make it or buy it or whatever it is like

692.88 --> 697.76
a whole it's a sep

694.56 --> 698.8
it's a closed system it's a closed

697.76 --> 701.12
system

698.8 --> 704.079
with its own thing and all kinds of

701.12 --> 707.839
systems it's like a big machine

704.079 --> 707.8389999999999
the whole thing is like a big machine

708.56 --> 716.6389999999999
and yeah cryptocurrency

713.12 --> 720.32
comes out of it but like the

716.639 --> 722.16
it's weird like gt plus was always like

720.32 --> 722.72
what is up with that and why is it so

722.16 --> 724.959
low but

722.72 --> 726.88
the thing is it doesn't matter because

724.959 --> 730.16
the gt plus cryptocurrency

726.88 --> 734.24
is like an internal cryptocurrency it's

730.16 --> 736.399
like chips in a uh

734.24 --> 737.44
in a casino not that the thing is a

736.399 --> 739.68
casino but just

737.44 --> 741.44
like chips literally in a casino don't

739.68 --> 742.959
mean anything they're only a value

741.44 --> 744.32
because they're used within

742.959 --> 747.1199999999999
and you're not supposed to leave with

744.32 --> 749.6
them etc etc right

747.12 --> 750.639
but it's an internal currency so the

749.6 --> 753.279
actual

750.639 --> 756.0
value on the market literally doesn't

753.279 --> 758.16
mean anything

756.0 --> 759.92
because you're not saving those points

758.16 --> 763.519
it's like an in-between currency

759.92 --> 765.279
that's what i was mistaken about earlier

763.519 --> 767.2
artificial no it's not artificial

765.279 --> 769.4399999999999
intelligence there's a whole bunch of

767.2 --> 774.399
people

769.44 --> 774.399
maintaining it working on it and

774.639 --> 784.48
yeah updating it figuring out new

779.44 --> 786.639
new ways to develop the internal system

784.48 --> 787.4300000000001
of which people are apart by having an

786.639 --> 790.53
account there

787.43 --> 790.53
[Music]

790.88 --> 797.76
right it's if yeah i've talked about it

795.279 --> 798.72
sporadically before but if you're really

797.76 --> 800.72
interested

798.72 --> 802.88
and you have investment room because to

800.72 --> 804.639
get in is not free like i got in free

802.88 --> 807.68
because i was basically

804.639 --> 810.16
gifted it by my dad

807.68 --> 811.5999999999999
because i had a previous system that i

810.16 --> 813.8389999999999
had kind of paid for

811.6 --> 815.279
and that thing like went completely

813.839 --> 819.0400000000001
rogue after like a year

815.279 --> 819.04
and then broke down

819.12 --> 822.639
right that thing was a scam this thing

822.0 --> 825.839
is not

822.639 --> 829.04
it's been there for a long time

825.839 --> 831.839
and it's working but they have it's like

829.04 --> 834.48
a micro socialism kingdom

831.839 --> 836.639
right that's what it is but it's

834.48 --> 837.04
separate it's completely separate it's

836.639 --> 839.199
not

837.04 --> 842.0
controlled by anything especially by

839.199 --> 845.68
globalism globalism attacks them

842.0 --> 848.8
has attacked them for a long time

845.68 --> 852.3199999999999
because it's not compatible it's like a

848.8 --> 855.04
virtual kingdom in the world

852.32 --> 855.44
that opposes globalism it's fascinating

855.04 --> 857.36
but

855.44 --> 859.1990000000001
that's like an esoteric rough

857.36 --> 861.839
description because

859.199 --> 863.279
it is really something new i don't even

861.839 --> 871.839
totally understand it

863.279 --> 871.8389999999999
it has taken a long time

873.68 --> 877.8389999999999
yeah but the crypto is it's not the

876.079 --> 880.399
foundation though

877.839 --> 881.12
they use crypto and they there is a

880.399 --> 883.44
crypto

881.12 --> 885.92
they're like the real crypto that's more

883.44 --> 888.48
comparable to bitcoin would be

885.92 --> 889.68
the fortuna system because they have a

888.48 --> 892.399
gt plus they have

889.68 --> 894.16
fortunas and they have super fortunas

892.399 --> 898.48
and the fortunas those are

894.16 --> 902.0
actual market cryptos

898.48 --> 903.12
that are really stable but yeah the gt

902.0 --> 905.36
plus is just like

903.12 --> 908.079
a chip currency it doesn't it's only

905.36 --> 910.24
internal doesn't the market value simply

908.079 --> 914.959
is irrelevant

910.24 --> 918.399
right but anyway if you're truly oh yeah

914.959 --> 921.5189999999999
they got a company store as in

918.399 --> 923.44
whatever you make if you don't

921.519 --> 925.68
you don't necessarily have to always

923.44 --> 929.1990000000001
wait on cashing it out you can literally

925.68 --> 932.399
buy internally things

929.199 --> 935.92
like uh you can rent cars

932.399 --> 941.68
they have like gt cars this is gt

935.92 --> 944.56
right it's not but

941.68 --> 946.56
yeah global cars it's called and then

944.56 --> 948.6389999999999
you can literally use the internal

946.56 --> 951.5999999999999
points that you save

948.639 --> 953.12
and trade them off just for like having

951.6 --> 956.639
all kinds of cars

953.12 --> 959.68
for like a year or up to 10 years

956.639 --> 959.6800000000001
it's pretty interesting

960.24 --> 966.88
and they're like they had been planning

962.8 --> 970.0
for a long time to expand upon that

966.88 --> 972.32
so that it's like its own virtual

970.0 --> 973.6
country its own kingdom with its own

972.32 --> 976.24
markets

973.6 --> 977.759
and you can just get your things there

976.24 --> 983.519
and use their markets

977.759 --> 986.72
and it's all very free really

983.519 --> 989.12
sorta it's it's

986.72 --> 990.32
it's out there man this is when i

989.12 --> 992.48
started

990.32 --> 994.48
engaging with this all that i thought is

992.48 --> 997.44
that i could kind of get a

994.48 --> 998.16
corporate basic income type situation

997.44 --> 1000.9590000000001
that is

998.16 --> 1002.8
kind of how it started up but now it's

1000.959 --> 1005.199
it's evolved

1002.8 --> 1008.079
it's like something else something i

1005.199 --> 1008.079
didn't expect

1008.72 --> 1016.24
it's like a successful mega corporation

1013.519 --> 1017.199
that hasn't become successful just by

1016.24 --> 1020.0790000000001
satanically

1017.199 --> 1023.04
[ __ ] things over and like raping and

1020.079 --> 1025.36
destroying other companies right

1023.04 --> 1026.799
the markets can now these guys this is

1025.36 --> 1030.0
something else guys

1026.799 --> 1032.0
it's really interesting but i have been

1030.0 --> 1033.919
really skeptical about it too it's just

1032.0 --> 1035.12
that i didn't i don't i'm not losing

1033.919 --> 1039.039
anything on it's just that

1035.12 --> 1041.76
some they've had a lot of hassle

1039.039 --> 1043.12
and like a lot of internal rewiring and

1041.76 --> 1044.8799999999999
just

1043.12 --> 1046.2399999999998
when there's already a massive amount of

1044.88 --> 1047.919
people engaged so there's

1046.24 --> 1049.52
there has been all kinds of hassle and

1047.919 --> 1051.2800000000002
it seemed almost like it was going to

1049.52 --> 1053.2
break down but

1051.28 --> 1054.3999999999999
they're really no they're not gonna let

1053.2 --> 1056.88
it break down

1054.4 --> 1059.039
apparently they'd keep reinventing

1056.88 --> 1061.1200000000001
themselves

1059.039 --> 1063.44
and now finally they're kind of like out

1061.12 --> 1065.36
of a crisis period

1063.44 --> 1067.76
and that's also resulting in longer

1065.36 --> 1070.3999999999999
waiting lines to cash

1067.76 --> 1070.4
on things

1071.84 --> 1077.6789999999999
to change the chips anyway

1075.44 --> 1079.3600000000001
so that's good news too there's good

1077.679 --> 1082.24
news from all sides

1079.36 --> 1082.24
it's incredible

1083.6 --> 1089.8999999999999
hello by the way agm good to see you

1086.42 --> 1089.9
[Music]

1090.08 --> 1095.84
anybody else out there on this sunday

1096.88 --> 1108.0800000000002
gti is a golf car buddy

1099.919 --> 1110.16
okay it is

1108.08 --> 1111.1999999999998
right but technically you have to keep

1110.16 --> 1114.0800000000002
in mind i can't

1111.2 --> 1115.76
really advertise for it but if you wanna

1114.08 --> 1119.52
if you're interested

1115.76 --> 1121.84
check me up on skype i've tried it with

1119.52 --> 1124.48
a couple of people before

1121.84 --> 1125.76
everybody didn't want to yeah this is

1124.48 --> 1129.44
your business

1125.76 --> 1131.28
right to be fair i've tried to bring

1129.44 --> 1133.679
this up for over two years

1131.28 --> 1136.24
very sporadically because you're not

1133.679 --> 1139.039
supposed to or something legally

1136.24 --> 1139.52
but yeah nobody has been interested so

1139.039 --> 1143.6
far

1139.52 --> 1146.96
your freaking loss i have invested zero

1143.6 --> 1147.84
zero in this and i'm only getting good

1146.96 --> 1149.679
things out of it

1147.84 --> 1151.84
and a couple of disappointments and some

1149.679 --> 1154.3200000000002
waiting lines

1151.84 --> 1154.32
right so

1156.559 --> 1159.9189999999999
and the whole thing is just getting

1157.919 --> 1160.7990000000002
better in the face where everything

1159.919 --> 1163.88
seems to be

1160.799 --> 1165.28
subjected to entropy and like

1163.88 --> 1169.2800000000002
scammification

1165.28 --> 1172.24
out there this thing is actually

1169.28 --> 1172.24
like developing

1172.72 --> 1179.28
separately from that [ __ ] so

1175.76 --> 1182.0
it is not degenerating it's actually

1179.28 --> 1182.0
growing better

1190.84 --> 1193.84
right

1201.2 --> 1204.4
investor yeah yeah we know george

1203.36 --> 1208.3999999999999
sanford

1204.4 --> 1212.48
yeah as i said this thing has been like

1208.4 --> 1216.799
targeted by banks

1212.48 --> 1219.6
like and people literally infiltrating

1216.799 --> 1220.559
lit like two like even like in the

1219.6 --> 1223.12
programmers

1220.559 --> 1225.84
like they tried all kinds of [ __ ] to

1223.12 --> 1225.84
take this down

1226.88 --> 1232.159
globalism globalists have invested

1232.84 --> 1236.72
billions

1234.559 --> 1239.12
billions to try to get them out of the

1236.72 --> 1243.919
way and they failed

1239.12 --> 1245.4399999999998
yeah and it's not even on the radar this

1243.919 --> 1246.72
is nobody's talking about you never

1245.44 --> 1250.48
heard of it right

1246.72 --> 1253.76
yeah yeah it's a serious threat

1250.48 --> 1256.559
to them it's it's it's like

1253.76 --> 1258.4
yeah that and i could get more

1256.559 --> 1261.84
metaphorical but the thing is

1258.4 --> 1266.4
yeah you're not supposed to do that

1261.84 --> 1266.3999999999999
but yeah serious threat yeah this is

1268.4 --> 1274.4
anyway hey

1271.6 --> 1274.3999999999999
adamikin

1274.96 --> 1279.76
cameron kamikaze gilmore hey yeah i also

1277.36 --> 1282.799
noticed your paypal donation

1279.76 --> 1285.28
thank you for that cameron kamikaze

1282.799 --> 1285.28
gilmore

1285.679 --> 1293.039
i'm glad i've been a good influence

1289.679 --> 1293.039
that was in the message with it

1296.96 --> 1305.8400000000001
here we go again seeking star wars

1314.64 --> 1317.8400000000001
well yeah george transferred yeah they

1316.88 --> 1321.0390000000002
had to move

1317.84 --> 1322.72
because the legal system was just it's

1321.039 --> 1327.52
corrupted

1322.72 --> 1331.039
yeah it is europe oh yeah

1327.52 --> 1334.32
and they just they wouldn't allow them

1331.039 --> 1334.32
to basically function

1335.12 --> 1339.9189999999999
even though they were following just the

1338.0 --> 1341.28
normal guidelines like they were

1339.919 --> 1344.72
literally just

1341.28 --> 1346.0
rolling in obstructions legally for no

1344.72 --> 1349.1200000000001
reason like a political

1346.0 --> 1353.2
attack right under the freaking radar

1349.12 --> 1355.36
okay so they moved

1353.2 --> 1356.88
to the one place where they're just kind

1355.36 --> 1359.1999999999998
of being left alone

1356.88 --> 1360.48
where the legal system actually helps

1359.2 --> 1362.4
against that

1360.48 --> 1364.799
and dubai is kind of like the

1362.4 --> 1368.0800000000002
switzerland

1364.799 --> 1368.08
is similar to that

1368.72 --> 1375.84
anyway and they're working just fine

1378.159 --> 1382.96
oh anamikan does which i yeah i read

1381.2 --> 1384.32
something i haven't seen it though i

1382.96 --> 1386.799
haven't watched

1384.32 --> 1389.6789999999999
but i heard that wits it kind of making

1386.799 --> 1392.0
that made an ass out of himself

1389.679 --> 1392.799
he went up against ranci right that's

1392.0 --> 1395.6
what i heard

1392.799 --> 1395.6
i didn't see it

1401.36 --> 1405.9189999999999
but maybe whitsid lost it

1407.36 --> 1416.08
you know maybe he got it once but he

1410.24 --> 1418.08
might have lost it

1416.08 --> 1419.76
maybe he ran out of adrenochrome or

1418.08 --> 1422.799
something that just kidding it's

1419.76 --> 1424.96
that's just lame but people say that

1422.799 --> 1431.6
sort of [ __ ] very easily but

1424.96 --> 1434.96
no not saying he does that

1431.6 --> 1434.9599999999998
as a figure of speech

1435.919 --> 1441.2
i don't know what he's doing man

1438.96 --> 1444.4
i just remember that wits it had a lot

1441.2 --> 1447.919
of good argumentations back

1444.4 --> 1450.72
in yeah in a while but now he apparently

1447.919 --> 1450.72
just screwed up

1457.6 --> 1463.6
wouldn't say that okay okay

1460.72 --> 1463.6000000000001
well i guess then

1463.76 --> 1466.799
i don't know i look this is pointless

1466.159 --> 1468.64
you're

1466.799 --> 1470.799
asking me to give my opinion on

1468.64 --> 1472.96
something i literally have no hint of

1470.799 --> 1475.36
i just saw it in chat i didn't go and

1472.96 --> 1475.3600000000001
watch it

1482.48 --> 1488.96
oh okay right okay fine

1486.0 --> 1490.88
well then i take it all back i don't

1488.96 --> 1495.2
know

1490.88 --> 1495.2
apparently you guys expected more of him

1496.159 --> 1501.8400000000001
but it hasn't been terrible i don't know

1530.799 --> 1534.08
so seeking star wars which it gives you

1533.2 --> 1543.8400000000001
weird vibes

1534.08 --> 1543.84
yeah me too a little

1555.36 --> 1571.84
right so anyway how are you guys doing

1582.84 --> 1585.84
um

1600.4 --> 1603.8400000000001
no that's not beer adam i don't drink

1603.039 --> 1607.279
beer

1603.84 --> 1610.8799999999999
on the early bird show

1607.279 --> 1614.72
that's gusto

1610.88 --> 1627.8400000000001
it's kind of like an herby energy drink

1614.72 --> 1627.84
the ginseng and all kinds of stuff

1652.84 --> 1655.84
ugh

1660.799 --> 1664.399
right yeah look i might have some beers

1663.84 --> 1666.8799999999999
later

1664.399 --> 1668.559
oh what am i saying yeah i am gonna have

1666.88 --> 1670.96
some beers later because i pretty much

1668.559 --> 1670.96
do that

1671.12 --> 1675.52
every day just a couple

1679.12 --> 1684.1589999999999
and i measure it out i've measured it

1682.399 --> 1686.0
out in a way that

1684.159 --> 1688.24
literally don't have any more alcohol in

1686.0 --> 1690.88
me when i go to bed

1688.24 --> 1691.36
and that way it works absolutely fine

1690.88 --> 1694.7990000000002
and i

1691.36 --> 1698.8799999999999
have literally zero morning

1694.799 --> 1698.8799999999999
and yeah nuisances because of it

1699.919 --> 1703.1200000000001
because that only seems to happen like

1701.76 --> 1707.919
after if i drink too

1703.12 --> 1707.9189999999999
late or like fall asleep with alcohol

1708.84 --> 1725.84
huh anyway

1729.6 --> 1734.8799999999999
so what have you all been up to saturday

1736.84 --> 1739.84
night

1761.039 --> 1764.24
for me big chunk of the evening i i was

1763.36 --> 1766.32
basically

1764.24 --> 1768.88
in a phone call with my friend again

1766.32 --> 1772.0
inaudible

1768.88 --> 1775.6000000000001
being quite ecstatic and she too so

1772.0 --> 1776.32
i think it's like it's probably just a

1775.6 --> 1779.6
resolve

1776.32 --> 1782.24
issue resolve moment in the weave

1779.6 --> 1784.0
because yeah i had a great time she had

1782.24 --> 1787.1200000000001
a great time

1784.0 --> 1792.0
all like the theme seems to be relief

1787.12 --> 1795.36
and resolve like in this

1792.0 --> 1798.399
rough period in time for me and

1795.36 --> 1798.399
for a lot of people

1802.32 --> 1809.84
watch a crappy film on youtube okay

1813.279 --> 1816.48
why would you do that when there's so

1815.84 --> 1819.84
much

1816.48 --> 1823.84
that is actually good

1819.84 --> 1823.84
or you wanted to see how crappy it was

1828.72 --> 1837.84
no ball buses was a bit lost yeah yeah

1841.2 --> 1844.32
oh campfire

1846.96 --> 1853.3600000000001
hippie bicycle builder felt crappy the

1850.559 --> 1853.36
next day ah

1854.399 --> 1856.6399999999999
okay

1859.2 --> 1865.3600000000001
i need recommendations

1862.24 --> 1865.679
be careful i might just hand you another

1865.36 --> 1868.7199999999998
2

1865.679 --> 1879.8400000000001
000 episode sci-fi series no there's not

1868.72 --> 1879.84
that many of those

1880.64 --> 1884.0
did he ever get around on netflix here

1882.799 --> 1886.1589999999999
we go again

1884.0 --> 1887.919
there are some really good series on

1886.159 --> 1890.48
there

1887.919 --> 1892.159
you know like uh last year i think it

1890.48 --> 1893.519
was yeah

1892.159 --> 1897.519
there were a couple of series that i

1893.519 --> 1897.519
watched that i was really impressed by

1901.44 --> 1906.799
i don't know if you remember that

1905.039 --> 1921.039
if you want something to watch a good

1906.799 --> 1923.36
series is always good you know

1921.039 --> 1925.36
never touch netflix yeah i know sir

1923.36 --> 1926.08
check out there is garbage on netflix

1925.36 --> 1928.8799999999999
too like

1926.08 --> 1929.76
it's really messed up some of the [ __ ]

1928.88 --> 1932.8400000000001
there

1929.76 --> 1934.48
but it's just algorithm steered too so

1932.84 --> 1937.6
eventually

1934.48 --> 1940.32
netflix will figure out what

1937.6 --> 1942.399
what you as a target audience are so

1940.32 --> 1943.9189999999999
it's not going to shove that disgusting

1942.399 --> 1947.5189999999998
[ __ ] in your face anymore

1943.919 --> 1949.8400000000001
that only happens if you click on it

1947.519 --> 1951.1200000000001
because then the algorithm thinks oh oh

1949.84 --> 1955.6
so you're into that

1951.12 --> 1957.84
are ya oh here's some more

1955.6 --> 1958.8799999999999
pile on with the garbage yeah that's

1957.84 --> 1960.48
what happens oh

1958.88 --> 1962.0
you want to score it you click on the

1960.48 --> 1964.799
squirt movie

1962.0 --> 1965.679
that's obviously squirty yeah guess

1964.799 --> 1967.36
what's gonna happen

1965.679 --> 1970.0800000000002
you're gonna get a whole lot more of

1967.36 --> 1973.519
that that's what happens

1970.08 --> 1977.039
right i pretty much only get

1973.519 --> 1979.1200000000001
older movies like 80s 90s movies that

1977.039 --> 1981.679
are pretty awesome that i like or

1979.12 --> 1984.2399999999998
some of the newer sci-fi fantasy

1981.679 --> 1987.44
historical stuff

1984.24 --> 1988.88
and yeah i don't get though sometimes

1987.44 --> 1990.96
there's things in my face

1988.88 --> 1993.0390000000002
where it's just like oh god i can't

1990.96 --> 1996.3990000000001
stand like the attitude

1993.039 --> 1998.96
of the characters here but

1996.399 --> 2000.32
most of it is like yeah it's that's

1998.96 --> 2003.039
that's decent enough

2000.32 --> 2005.039
to maybe watch sometime when i feel like

2003.039 --> 2006.8799999999999
it

2005.039 --> 2009.12
but it all depends if you're going to

2006.88 --> 2010.48
look up the squirty things and then

2009.12 --> 2012.32
click them and be all

2010.48 --> 2013.44
outraged and stuff on you yeah guess

2012.32 --> 2015.6
what's going to happen you're going to

2013.44 --> 2018.0
get a whole bunch more of those shoved

2015.6 --> 2021.84
in your face then after that point so

2018.0 --> 2024.08
you gotta be careful what you're doing

2021.84 --> 2026.48
because there is some really terrible

2024.08 --> 2033.84
garbage on there as well

2026.48 --> 2033.84
and you gotta avoid that like bad ads

2038.48 --> 2046.159
anyway green

2041.519 --> 2048.96
arrow ah

2046.159 --> 2051.359
yeah there's a whole bunch of marvel

2048.96 --> 2053.28
superhero stuff up it's there's so many

2051.359 --> 2055.2
superheroes it's insane well

2053.28 --> 2061.44
south park already made an episode about

2055.2 --> 2065.5989999999997
that like how out of control

2061.44 --> 2067.679
this is like the superhero series market

2065.599 --> 2070.32
how many are there like 200 or something

2067.679 --> 2073.359
i don't know a desert random

2070.32 --> 2076.2400000000002
number but just so many of that

2073.359 --> 2076.24
that's crazy

2080.48 --> 2084.32
and the quality is extremely mixed

2086.399 --> 2089.5989999999997
because some of them are pretty well

2088.079 --> 2090.96
done it's like whoa that's pretty

2089.599 --> 2094.8790000000004
spectacular

2090.96 --> 2098.16
and others are like oh my god really

2094.879 --> 2099.7599999999998
really i could do better you know if i

2098.16 --> 2101.68
put something together or like it's

2099.76 --> 2105.0400000000004
everybody so woody or whatever

2101.68 --> 2107.1189999999997
just not into it or like the

2105.04 --> 2109.2
lighting is terrible or something right

2107.119 --> 2117.839
not all of them are good

2109.2 --> 2117.839
there's a lot of crappy ones too

2118.88 --> 2125.44
i've dug through some but yeah it's very

2122.8 --> 2128.7200000000003
mixed quality and there's also just

2125.44 --> 2128.7200000000003
movies in there that are

2129.2 --> 2136.24
weird different style

2132.8 --> 2140.0
like movies that were like

2136.24 --> 2142.72
had no story it was just

2140.0 --> 2143.2
very basic story and a whole bunch of

2142.72 --> 2146.7999999999997
action

2143.2 --> 2149.5989999999997
action scenes like really

2146.8 --> 2151.76
minimalist action movie right and

2149.599 --> 2153.76
there's a couple of those it's not just

2151.76 --> 2155.6800000000003
one it's like a whole different style

2153.76 --> 2157.6800000000003
that was weird to see

2155.68 --> 2159.04
but i do get bored by it because yeah

2157.68 --> 2161.9199999999996
it's no no

2159.04 --> 2164.24
the spirit's off right you know these

2161.92 --> 2166.0
people are really good at the combat

2164.24 --> 2166.3999999999996
maneuvers and that [ __ ] and that's what

2166.0 --> 2168.96
they're

2166.4 --> 2170.88
really in love with and focused on but

2168.96 --> 2173.839
like as actors they're actually

2170.88 --> 2173.839
meh

2176.56 --> 2180.96
right but it's funny because it's just a

2178.72 --> 2182.56
whole different style

2180.96 --> 2184.96
i don't really make a lot of mention of

2182.56 --> 2187.7599999999998
those by the way

2184.96 --> 2188.48
so eventually i always go just like in

2187.76 --> 2191.76
music for

2188.48 --> 2194.96
melody complexity spirit

2191.76 --> 2198.1600000000003
fractal nature so more

2194.96 --> 2202.64
full complete spirited products

2198.16 --> 2202.64
get my attention a lot more uh

2202.68 --> 2206.0699999999997
[Music]

2206.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
the marvel juggernaut rolls on yeah yeah

2226.839 --> 2229.839
right

2234.079 --> 2237.6800000000003
right but see there's a whole bunch of

2236.079 --> 2241.04
other types of series

2237.68 --> 2242.8799999999997
not from the marvel or the dc universe

2241.04 --> 2245.119
that are just like no we're just

2242.88 --> 2247.92
superheroes

2245.119 --> 2249.6800000000003
in some world and there's a series about

2247.92 --> 2252.7200000000003
it and

2249.68 --> 2254.839
like the names yeah are

2252.72 --> 2256.3999999999996
kind of like backdrop doesn't really

2254.839 --> 2259.599
like

2256.4 --> 2261.6800000000003
more like concept series like that that

2259.599 --> 2263.44
are like superhero series but it's just

2261.68 --> 2266.7999999999997
it doesn't have any association

2263.44 --> 2268.64
there's lots of that too and with mixed

2266.8 --> 2270.079
results some of them are actually kind

2268.64 --> 2272.96
of interesting others are just

2270.079 --> 2272.96
completely lame

2273.74 --> 2285.839
[Music]

2275.839 --> 2285.839
right anyway

2286.24 --> 2289.5989999999997
now the best actors are on the news and

2288.4 --> 2293.26
politics or the

2289.599 --> 2295.839
best actors no the worst actors

2293.26 --> 2298.0
[Music]

2295.839 --> 2301.2
like they're good at acting but as

2298.0 --> 2301.2
actors they're terrible

2302.4 --> 2313.839
like they are doing terrible things with

2304.88 --> 2313.839
their acting

2318.56 --> 2324.24
what doctor who sex change oh my god

2324.839 --> 2327.839
really

2338.839 --> 2341.839
ugh

2357.44 --> 2361.119
not george sanford that is good

2359.48 --> 2363.52
pre-programming

2361.119 --> 2364.8
getting like the media getting everybody

2363.52 --> 2366.96
in a mask

2364.8 --> 2368.2400000000002
that's good pre-programming right

2366.96 --> 2371.599
because people have

2368.24 --> 2375.5989999999997
already been pre-programmed through

2371.599 --> 2378.4
virus things in series and movies

2375.599 --> 2378.4
for yeah

2379.359 --> 2385.2
until the beginning of movies

2382.88 --> 2386.1600000000003
right even the old star trek was full of

2385.2 --> 2391.2799999999997
that [ __ ]

2386.16 --> 2394.839
the idea of viruses and vaccines

2391.28 --> 2398.0
that's super old 60s

2394.839 --> 2401.359
so yeah the pre-programming

2398.0 --> 2404.88
simply makes people then yeah when

2401.359 --> 2407.5989999999997
media starts basically shoving that [ __ ]

2404.88 --> 2408.8
they are like oh right so it's just like

2407.599 --> 2411.2000000000003
in the movies

2408.8 --> 2412.7200000000003
okay we get that okay so just do what

2411.2 --> 2414.96
they say because that's what they do in

2412.72 --> 2416.3999999999996
the movies and everything is all right

2414.96 --> 2418.56
that's basically it it's the

2416.4 --> 2422.96
pre-programming

2418.56 --> 2426.16
like the way to respond has already been

2422.96 --> 2426.16
programmed into them

2426.8 --> 2435.8390000000004
for example in stories

2430.88 --> 2435.839
on tv and series sci-fi series

2436.839 --> 2441.92
everything

2439.839 --> 2444.56
all right what what do you do when there

2441.92 --> 2446.96
is a virus of whatever nature

2444.56 --> 2448.24
what is terrestrial or extraterrestrial

2446.96 --> 2451.119
whatever

2448.24 --> 2452.319
you quick you panic you go to the

2451.119 --> 2455.839
medical expert

2452.319 --> 2457.68
the doctor they fix it usually resulting

2455.839 --> 2458.88
in some kind of vaccine and then it

2457.68 --> 2461.2
fixed

2458.88 --> 2461.2000000000003
right

2461.92 --> 2469.92
that's the pre-programming structure

2466.319 --> 2472.0
right there how many times in series do

2469.92 --> 2475.04
the doctors actually turn out to be

2472.0 --> 2476.8
evil and the ones

2475.04 --> 2478.839
that are actually injecting them with

2476.8 --> 2482.48
poison instead to make it worse

2478.839 --> 2485.04
no right sometimes oh the doctor

2482.48 --> 2485.52
invented the virus and then brings the

2485.04 --> 2488.64
cure

2485.52 --> 2491.28
the super villain system right

2488.64 --> 2493.68
but that's always very confined in how

2491.28 --> 2496.6400000000003
it's presented

2493.68 --> 2499.2
right so this is all pre-programmed

2496.64 --> 2499.2
structure

2500.72 --> 2504.16
that's why it went so easy that's why so

2502.72 --> 2506.16
many people went along because

2504.16 --> 2509.839
everything they watched already told

2506.16 --> 2509.839
them exactly how to respond

2548.839 --> 2553.599
hmm

2550.96 --> 2556.7200000000003
yeah see star wars yeah i i've kind of

2553.599 --> 2560.6400000000003
appreciated doctor who but

2556.72 --> 2563.2
a lot of it i didn't like because it was

2560.64 --> 2564.56
it was like prone to like political

2563.2 --> 2568.7999999999997
influences

2564.56 --> 2572.16
a lot leftist influences

2568.8 --> 2575.52
at first like modest leftist

2572.16 --> 2578.16
and yeah

2575.52 --> 2580.24
it just every time i see it there's

2578.16 --> 2583.44
always something in there that like

2580.24 --> 2586.9599999999996
really annoys me and that's like

2583.44 --> 2588.4
every series they're just things in

2586.96 --> 2590.079
there that are like yeah you're

2588.4 --> 2592.0
you're there just to manipulate

2590.079 --> 2595.04
everybody i don't like

2592.0 --> 2597.2
it like that but as a concept series

2595.04 --> 2597.52
yeah fascinating hey it has the tardis

2597.2 --> 2600.64
right

2597.52 --> 2604.4
the small

2600.64 --> 2605.839
space with a larger space inside spatial

2604.4 --> 2609.44
non-linearity there you go

2605.839 --> 2611.119
another well-known example of spatial

2609.44 --> 2614.8
non-linearity so

2611.119 --> 2617.359
to me it's even important to always

2614.8 --> 2619.52
keep it in mind as another example of

2617.359 --> 2621.44
spatial non-linearity which is part of

2619.52 --> 2625.04
my

2621.44 --> 2625.04
cosmogeny development

2625.28 --> 2636.7200000000003
the things that i'm trying to explain

2634.4 --> 2637.599
oh now that influences off the charts

2636.72 --> 2640.3999999999996
right but

2637.599 --> 2643.04
you have look back look back at like the

2640.4 --> 2645.359
old old doctor who

2643.04 --> 2648.0
they do that [ __ ] there too but it is

2645.359 --> 2650.72
modest left influence right but

2648.0 --> 2651.28
if you look carefully and you don't

2650.72 --> 2655.2
measure

2651.28 --> 2657.2000000000003
the stick by your period in history and

2655.2 --> 2658.72
what you're used to but actually to what

2657.2 --> 2659.359
everybody then was used to and look

2658.72 --> 2661.1189999999997
carefully

2659.359 --> 2663.2799999999997
you'll see they've been doing that there

2661.119 --> 2665.359
too they always had that sort of

2663.28 --> 2668.4
influence all this political or

2665.359 --> 2671.44
social leftist influence

2668.4 --> 2675.359
and yeah left started out pretty modest

2671.44 --> 2676.16
like modest progressive carefully trying

2675.359 --> 2678.56
to improve

2676.16 --> 2680.48
everybody make them more tolerant and

2678.56 --> 2690.0789999999997
all that when it all seems still

2680.48 --> 2691.92
like reasonable and kind of innocent and

2690.079 --> 2695.28
when there was still a lot of

2691.92 --> 2698.8
like bad a yeah right wing

2695.28 --> 2703.119
corrupted right wing as well that would

2698.8 --> 2707.76
just yeah that was then we almost forget

2703.119 --> 2719.839
but there was there was that as well

2707.76 --> 2719.8390000000004
but yeah that always happens but anyway

2724.72 --> 2732.24
all right logan's run yeah sure

2728.96 --> 2735.92
but you know if

2732.24 --> 2735.9199999999996
doctor who became a female

2736.4 --> 2740.319
it wouldn't necessarily have to be

2738.48 --> 2743.599
terrible

2740.319 --> 2745.44
if they were still doctor who like if

2743.599 --> 2749.28
she wasn't like oh

2745.44 --> 2750.2400000000002
doctor who is a female now so i'm going

2749.28 --> 2753.3590000000004
to be very

2750.24 --> 2754.7999999999997
femmy oh because it's so special that

2753.359 --> 2756.88
the doctor was a female

2754.8 --> 2758.96
that would be annoying as [ __ ] but if

2756.88 --> 2761.76
they were actually like no

2758.96 --> 2763.599
acting like yeah i'm still used to being

2761.76 --> 2764.48
a man and then i'm a woman and then

2763.599 --> 2767.6800000000003
whatever

2764.48 --> 2768.56
you know like it could just be like it

2767.68 --> 2770.96
just a

2768.56 --> 2772.16
little thingy doesn't yeah they could

2770.96 --> 2774.2400000000002
still

2772.16 --> 2776.24
do the role good if the actress was

2774.24 --> 2778.0
really good

2776.24 --> 2780.8799999999997
really understood doctor who and didn't

2778.0 --> 2783.359
want to all feminize it or whatever

2780.88 --> 2786.079
but yeah from the sound of it that that

2783.359 --> 2786.0789999999997
is what they did

2786.839 --> 2791.839
right

2789.04 --> 2791.839
because yeah

2792.319 --> 2797.44
they're all too drunk on virtue

2800.839 --> 2808.0299999999997
signaling

2802.53 --> 2808.03
[Music]

2816.8 --> 2820.0
just be happy that they didn't literally

2819.52 --> 2822.88
make it

2820.0 --> 2824.64
transform into like a transgender or

2822.88 --> 2828.7200000000003
something right

2824.64 --> 2831.92
just yeah

2828.72 --> 2834.3999999999996
like not as in like oh but i am a

2831.92 --> 2838.319
creature that is neutral and

2834.4 --> 2839.599
but like actually with weirdo clothes

2838.319 --> 2842.319
and makeup and [ __ ]

2839.599 --> 2843.599
right yeah yeah just be happy it's not

2842.319 --> 2848.64
that

2843.599 --> 2852.48
okay and they might go there

2848.64 --> 2854.72
you know just a woman

2852.48 --> 2855.76
doesn't even have to be like too big of

2854.72 --> 2858.16
an issue

2855.76 --> 2858.8
of course the reason to do it is super

2858.16 --> 2873.839
annoying

2858.8 --> 2873.8390000000004
but hey

2874.16 --> 2878.7999999999997
oh god read the section oh that sounds

2877.599 --> 2881.52
terrible adam

2878.8 --> 2883.44
if it's all become super it's like this

2881.52 --> 2886.8
virtue signal world yeah that's

2883.44 --> 2890.319
super annoying

2886.8 --> 2890.7200000000003
look at me trying to somehow envision

2890.319 --> 2894.319
some

2890.72 --> 2897.04
sensibility i can't help it it just

2894.319 --> 2898.72
can't help but imagine like yeah if they

2897.04 --> 2902.24
really wanted to

2898.72 --> 2905.1189999999997
they could fix it even with the choices

2902.24 --> 2905.7599999999998
even with the virtue signal the reasons

2905.119 --> 2907.599
like

2905.76 --> 2909.599
but if they're just gonna make it only

2907.599 --> 2910.88
about virtue signaling and the stupid

2909.599 --> 2913.76
attitudes

2910.88 --> 2914.0
in there yeah then it's just screwed

2913.76 --> 2928.4300000000003
yeah

2914.0 --> 2931.6
that's just garbage

2928.43 --> 2931.6
[Music]

2936.559 --> 2943.6800000000003
star wars franchise has introduced two

2939.079 --> 2946.1600000000003
non-binary characters

2943.68 --> 2946.16
whatever

2947.839 --> 2951.04
as long as that is not like the only

2950.16 --> 2954.24
thing that is

2951.04 --> 2957.2799999999997
in the attention right look

2954.24 --> 2959.1189999999997
there is like look star wars you know

2957.28 --> 2961.28
even in the star wars universe there's

2959.119 --> 2964.7200000000003
literally non-sexual aliens that are

2961.28 --> 2968.1600000000003
like i don't know

2964.72 --> 2970.24
what is the cloning reproduction that

2968.16 --> 2973.92
have no gender and all that like

2970.24 --> 2978.5589999999997
oh big issue right no it's about

2973.92 --> 2981.04
oh it's humans human specific

2978.559 --> 2982.48
that obviously do have a sex that are

2981.04 --> 2985.839
then like oh we're

2982.48 --> 2988.48
trans and all special and like weird

2985.839 --> 2990.96
make it weird and then make the entire

2988.48 --> 2993.52
[ __ ] thing about that specifically

2990.96 --> 2996.559
alone like that the rest of the star

2993.52 --> 2999.839
wars would become a complete side note

2996.559 --> 3003.2000000000003
yeah that would be annoying as [ __ ]

2999.839 --> 3006.4
ugh but

3003.2 --> 3009.2
yeah you know you can

3006.4 --> 3013.839
do these things in ways that aren't just

3009.2 --> 3013.839
going to disturb everybody

3024.839 --> 3027.839
whatever

3036.16 --> 3042.96
okay well they're aliens so yeah oh

3040.0 --> 3044.48
aliens they're not they're trans

3042.96 --> 3048.4
naturally they were

3044.48 --> 3051.2
created rather whatever man

3048.4 --> 3051.2000000000003
get a life

3052.4 --> 3069.839
nobody cares or well i don't

3056.16 --> 3069.839
you apparently do ugh

3095.76 --> 3100.96
it's just that look the entire left has

3098.4 --> 3103.04
just completely lost

3100.96 --> 3104.2400000000002
what how do you call it not lost lost

3103.04 --> 3106.5589999999997
the plot

3104.24 --> 3108.839
they lost the plot with their garbage

3106.559 --> 3113.0400000000004
because they went from

3108.839 --> 3115.839
suggesting making people think about it

3113.04 --> 3116.319
consider it like see that there might be

3115.839 --> 3118.4
something

3116.319 --> 3119.7599999999998
reasonable and good about it right

3118.4 --> 3122.319
that's the old

3119.76 --> 3123.119
the old left they went from that to just

3122.319 --> 3125.7599999999998
straight out

3123.119 --> 3128.2400000000002
indoctrination like oh hype it up this

3125.76 --> 3131.76
is so awesome this is so different oh

3128.24 --> 3132.0789999999997
the old ways don't have to tear you down

3131.76 --> 3135.0400000000004
and

3132.079 --> 3136.0
shackle you down in your unlimited

3135.04 --> 3139.2
spectrum

3136.0 --> 3139.68
gender spectrum view so they went from

3139.2 --> 3142.24
just

3139.68 --> 3143.68
carefully letting people well why did

3142.24 --> 3146.64
have you ever thought about this

3143.68 --> 3148.0
like this is different right but isn't

3146.64 --> 3151.2
that interesting

3148.0 --> 3152.72
to oh this is special now you must be

3151.2 --> 3156.319
different because anything

3152.72 --> 3159.9199999999996
non-different is evil and old and

3156.319 --> 3162.5589999999997
crazy and yeah

3159.92 --> 3163.6800000000003
that's the problem right i think that

3162.559 --> 3166.6400000000003
plenty of people

3163.68 --> 3168.0789999999997
would very much welcome back the old

3166.64 --> 3170.64
left

3168.079 --> 3172.559
because hey i thought even like the

3170.64 --> 3174.96
weird ideas that they would bring forth

3172.559 --> 3177.6800000000003
very carefully

3174.96 --> 3179.839
yeah it was interesting it did make me

3177.68 --> 3183.52
think

3179.839 --> 3183.92
think that it actually caused me to be

3183.52 --> 3185.839
more

3183.92 --> 3187.7200000000003
liberal much more than just this

3185.839 --> 3192.5589999999997
disgusting

3187.72 --> 3195.359
indoctrination culture right now

3192.559 --> 3198.559
like the forceful left from the old left

3195.359 --> 3198.5589999999997
to the forceful left

3199.839 --> 3203.04
i think plenty of people would just be

3201.839 --> 3205.2799999999997
like fine okay

3203.04 --> 3206.8
you want to talk about it yeah be subtle

3205.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
again

3206.8 --> 3209.8390000000004
like in the old days

3216.559 --> 3221.52
thanks to the in time you'll have to

3221.119 --> 3224.8
quit

3221.52 --> 3228.24
so much no no sir check oh i

3224.8 --> 3231.44
simply default

3228.24 --> 3233.1189999999997
it's like what do you call that uh some

3231.44 --> 3236.64
text you have to show before

3233.119 --> 3240.0
like to basically legally

3236.64 --> 3241.1189999999997
clear things up no i just when i suspect

3240.0 --> 3244.48
somebody to be

3241.119 --> 3245.839
all into the trans thing i make it very

3244.48 --> 3248.88
abundantly clear like

3245.839 --> 3252.16
yeah i am

3248.88 --> 3255.119
exactly the opposite of all that

3252.16 --> 3257.359
right so whatever you're going to bring

3255.119 --> 3258.079
on that is associated with that type of

3257.359 --> 3261.2
thinking

3258.079 --> 3263.3590000000004
i guarantee that i'll say no

3261.2 --> 3265.1189999999997
every single time and that includes in

3263.359 --> 3269.44
giving it recognition

3265.119 --> 3271.599
so unless it's somebody i'm going to be

3269.44 --> 3274.64
closely communicating with a lot

3271.599 --> 3277.28
right so if somebody is transgender

3274.64 --> 3278.4
and they were like oh yeah i used to be

3277.28 --> 3281.8390000000004
a girl

3278.4 --> 3283.92
but i i want to be a bro and actually

3281.839 --> 3285.04
act like that then i'll be like okay

3283.92 --> 3288.079
okay fine

3285.04 --> 3292.24
i'll call try to address you as a guy

3288.079 --> 3294.079
that's about it right

3292.24 --> 3295.839
and i'm gonna have difficulties with it

3294.079 --> 3298.7200000000003
i had difficulties with it with

3295.839 --> 3300.319
yeah i had somebody like that in my dnd

3298.72 --> 3302.64
group

3300.319 --> 3304.16
and when i was a great person i really

3302.64 --> 3308.0789999999997
liked him

3304.16 --> 3308.0789999999997
no to me it's still a her

3308.16 --> 3314.16
right like i'll it's not like i'm

3311.76 --> 3316.1600000000003
completely merciless but in general when

3314.16 --> 3317.359
people get hyped up over that i step

3316.16 --> 3319.44
away

3317.359 --> 3320.5589999999997
just like no i'm not interested i'm not

3319.44 --> 3323.28
interested in

3320.559 --> 3325.599
that thing at all right you want to do

3323.28 --> 3328.6400000000003
that fine do it on your own

3325.599 --> 3330.88
i'm not interested i see that as

3328.64 --> 3331.7599999999998
a complete waste of time and like is

3330.88 --> 3335.359
definitely

3331.76 --> 3349.3590000000004
bordered on sin if you're gonna act out

3335.359 --> 3351.839
on it

3349.359 --> 3354.24
right yes here check oh yeah it's very

3351.839 --> 3354.24
easy

3354.319 --> 3358.0
you know you could apply the owen

3356.079 --> 3359.6800000000003
benjamin approach and just say okay you

3358.0 --> 3364.4
have a man

3359.68 --> 3364.3999999999996
you have a woman and you have a gay

3366.0 --> 3373.28
that's it it's like oh yeah gay of

3369.44 --> 3376.48
the the fractal order of infinite

3373.28 --> 3378.6400000000003
flags of specificity of

3376.48 --> 3380.2400000000002
form of gayness or you could just call

3378.64 --> 3382.5589999999997
it gay

3380.24 --> 3384.24
right after that point it doesn't really

3382.559 --> 3387.3590000000004
matter anymore it

3384.24 --> 3391.839
might matter to them among one another

3387.359 --> 3391.839
it doesn't matter to me

3395.04 --> 3399.2799999999997
but hey if you want me to treat you with

3397.599 --> 3401.119
respect

3399.28 --> 3402.48
then you have to present yourself

3401.119 --> 3406.2400000000002
naturally

3402.48 --> 3410.4
and not in some weird stage

3406.24 --> 3412.5589999999997
show role this specific gender with a

3410.4 --> 3417.44
specific attitude

3412.559 --> 3421.28
no like if you have characteristics

3417.44 --> 3422.7200000000003
as a guy that might be interpreted as

3421.28 --> 3425.119
gay or whatever

3422.72 --> 3427.7599999999998
and it's really naturally in you and you

3425.119 --> 3430.6400000000003
don't like over exaggerate it

3427.76 --> 3432.4
then yeah that's fine i can tolerate

3430.64 --> 3435.68
that as long as you

3432.4 --> 3438.0
leave it to that right if you're gonna

3435.68 --> 3439.44
try to force something on me or play a

3438.0 --> 3442.16
game like oh i wouldn't

3439.44 --> 3443.28
i wouldn't try out something with you

3442.16 --> 3445.7599999999998
secretly

3443.28 --> 3447.3590000000004
then i'm gonna say like no [ __ ] the hell

3445.76 --> 3449.559
off

3447.359 --> 3451.52
right if you have some correct

3449.559 --> 3454.2400000000002
characteristics that might not be

3451.52 --> 3455.599
super ultra male and you're gay guy or

3454.24 --> 3458.64
whatever

3455.599 --> 3460.88
fine don't push it

3458.64 --> 3461.92
and for women yeah it's different but

3460.88 --> 3465.119
that's because yeah

3461.92 --> 3467.6800000000003
i'm a guy and i'm heterosexual and

3465.119 --> 3468.4
many relationships with well women that

3467.68 --> 3472.839
said

3468.4 --> 3475.839
they were gay and i'm just like yeah

3472.839 --> 3475.839
sure

3477.119 --> 3480.079
we'll see about that

3481.04 --> 3487.52
but yeah so it's different

3484.559 --> 3490.96
you can barely get a grasp on like how

3487.52 --> 3490.96
women work like that anyway

3499.04 --> 3504.24
and i don't really like butch women not

3502.24 --> 3504.5589999999997
necessarily like their physical build

3504.24 --> 3506.5589999999997
but

3504.559 --> 3509.3590000000004
their if their attitude is butch i don't

3506.559 --> 3509.3590000000004
like that at all

3514.839 --> 3517.839
right

3528.88 --> 3531.839
oh god

3533.359 --> 3538.5589999999997
yeah here we go they try to pull that

3535.839 --> 3541.2
sort of [ __ ] all the time

3538.559 --> 3543.28
i don't even want to name the examples

3541.2 --> 3546.48
really right because it's just

3543.28 --> 3547.52
that's literally literally being

3546.48 --> 3551.359
outraged

3547.52 --> 3555.04
talking about it bringing it up is

3551.359 --> 3558.799
doing exactly what it was intended for

3555.04 --> 3560.24
to get in everybody's face to stick to

3558.799 --> 3563.28
mind to make you all go

3560.24 --> 3564.4799999999996
savage over it so that you'll be

3563.28 --> 3567.8390000000004
thinking about that

3564.48 --> 3568.88
instead of moving on with things that

3567.839 --> 3573.839
are productive

3568.88 --> 3573.839
in your life right

3579.599 --> 3585.04
is it some kind of like transgender day

3582.079 --> 3588.319
or something today i have no idea

3585.04 --> 3590.799
but it seemed to be really a theme today

3588.319 --> 3590.799
as well

3591.839 --> 3601.839
like what is this

3604.559 --> 3611.28
if you talked about ron t versus austin

3607.92 --> 3615.359
no logan it's run i i have no idea

3611.28 --> 3618.559
look i don't watch ranty stuff anymore

3615.359 --> 3621.92
it's so annoying to listen to him now

3618.559 --> 3625.76
for me it's just

3621.92 --> 3628.48
because everything he had

3625.76 --> 3629.76
originally when he was part of the

3628.48 --> 3632.079
debate screw

3629.76 --> 3633.92
all that spark all the dead the

3632.079 --> 3637.119
denseness of spirit

3633.92 --> 3639.04
it's all gone there's nothing about him

3637.119 --> 3639.359
anymore that i find appealing to listen

3639.04 --> 3644.96
to

3639.359 --> 3644.96
at all is worse than with jose

3645.04 --> 3649.2
i i just can't listen to his garbage

3648.0 --> 3656.079
anymore i can't do it

3649.2 --> 3657.4399999999996
it's it's too boring and annoying so

3656.079 --> 3660.88
yeah i know he's doing

3657.44 --> 3662.88
a lot of hangouts all over the place and

3660.88 --> 3666.0
being the special boy who

3662.88 --> 3667.839
is revealing nathan oakley as a cult and

3666.0 --> 3671.599
i got away from the cult

3667.839 --> 3675.119
oh my god i'm a special boy now

3671.599 --> 3676.96
yeah i know he's doing that but

3675.119 --> 3679.52
everything he does is just completely

3676.96 --> 3679.52
useless

3682.839 --> 3685.839
so

3697.839 --> 3703.92
came from dr who talk

3701.119 --> 3703.92
oh my god

3704.24 --> 3707.2
what really

3708.319 --> 3713.839
wait are you saying that that oh god

3715.039 --> 3717.6800000000003
right so

3721.599 --> 3725.119
right i see it's weird how this works

3724.4 --> 3728.0
right

3725.119 --> 3730.0
but trans is kind of like the mental

3728.0 --> 3733.039
thing

3730.0 --> 3736.16
but [ __ ] is when it gets all

3733.039 --> 3737.599
freaky like weirdo clown looking and

3736.16 --> 3740.64
[ __ ]

3737.599 --> 3742.319
right so are you saying that like doctor

3740.64 --> 3745.359
who didn't only go oh

3742.319 --> 3749.2
trans special boy here she see

3745.359 --> 3749.52
blood whatever but they actually went

3749.2 --> 3752.319
full

3749.52 --> 3753.839
[ __ ] is that what you're saying holy

3752.319 --> 3757.2
[ __ ]

3753.839 --> 3757.2
that's messed up man

3766.079 --> 3769.8390000000004
i guess it would be inevitable

3770.72 --> 3774.3999999999996
once you slide down that slide

3773.28 --> 3777.6800000000003
eventually

3774.4 --> 3780.7200000000003
you won't be able to stop sliding

3777.68 --> 3782.96
not yet but i'm sure yeah yeah exactly

3780.72 --> 3784.9599999999996
exactly once they start sliding down

3782.96 --> 3786.96
that slide at some point they can't stop

3784.96 --> 3790.4
the sliding anymore and they are going

3786.96 --> 3790.4
to go straight down to hell

3790.88 --> 3794.6400000000003
and not stop until the whole thing

3794.839 --> 3800.54
explodes

3797.35 --> 3800.54
[Music]

3836.839 --> 3839.839
hmm

3842.079 --> 3845.76
right i think i'm gonna round out the

3843.839 --> 3848.96
show because these subjects also

3845.76 --> 3853.8390000000004
are like i don't wanna talk another half

3848.96 --> 3853.839
hour or more about this [ __ ]

3858.24 --> 3862.72
so yeah tomorrow another day another

3861.28 --> 3864.96
chance

3862.72 --> 3867.839
hopefully some more flat earth related

3864.96 --> 3867.839
subjects

3868.0 --> 3873.119
and then today i can have just some time

3870.0 --> 3876.559
to let it all sink right

3873.119 --> 3879.119
and get my uh my financial situation in

3876.559 --> 3882.2400000000002
order and all that

3879.119 --> 3885.599
men are getting to female print what

3882.24 --> 3888.799
oh right oh god yeah

3885.599 --> 3889.28
just don't go all squirting over all of

3888.799 --> 3893.2
that

3889.28 --> 3898.3190000000004
you know when you squirt too much

3893.2 --> 3898.319
over these things that is also gay right

3907.119 --> 3911.359
yes guns have never run r p yes i have

3909.599 --> 3916.2400000000002
noticed that he looks

3911.359 --> 3919.92
sick and he's lost his

3916.24 --> 3923.7599999999998
his condensed spirit right because yeah

3919.92 --> 3926.64
it's his choice man whatever he did

3923.76 --> 3926.6400000000003
was his choice

3933.599 --> 3937.839
movie recommendations anyone

3941.28 --> 3951.8390000000004
sure not any new ones though i don't i

3945.92 --> 3951.839
barely know about newer movies

3953.2 --> 3962.24
binary parade here yesterday okay

3957.76 --> 3979.8390000000004
cease fire what's that

3962.24 --> 3979.839
a sea okay

3988.96 --> 3994.0
but you know what i wonder

3992.079 --> 3997.44
like did ranty actually take the

3994.0 --> 4000.24
coronavax or something

3997.44 --> 4001.44
would be quite insane if he did but he

4000.24 --> 4004.0
might have

4001.44 --> 4004.0
who knows

4004.88 --> 4008.96
wouldn't that be interesting to find out

4009.039 --> 4014.1600000000003
and not like and that doesn't mean that

4011.44 --> 4016.4
he would even admit that he did it

4014.16 --> 4016.3999999999996
right

4018.319 --> 4025.599
anyway whatever don't

4021.359 --> 4025.5989999999997
don't ponder too much on that like

4032.839 --> 4038.24
ah

4034.88 --> 4049.839
yes s smith we know

4038.24 --> 4049.839
it's all over the news

4052.96 --> 4057.359
yes guns of nephron rmp that's what i

4055.119 --> 4057.359
thought

4057.76 --> 4063.599
right it might have like been the

4059.359 --> 4066.88
signature that they demanded of him

4063.599 --> 4071.839
like seriously the ballers may have made

4066.88 --> 4071.839
ranty do it as part of the act

4074.839 --> 4077.839
really

4086.4 --> 4090.799
right anyway i think i'm gonna round out

4088.559 --> 4094.2400000000002
the show

4090.799 --> 4098.0
so again i'm gonna mention

4094.24 --> 4100.88

4107.44 --> 4110.799

needed that and

4110.799 --> 4118.319
yes finally

4114.64 --> 4121.279
but also in a way unexpected

4118.319 --> 4121.6
i guess it's always unexpected when out

4121.279 --> 4123.4400000000005
of

4121.6 --> 4126.0
like the blue suddenly after a long

i haven't just used it in a year and yes

4162.48 --> 4166.718999999999

4164.48 --> 4167.5199999999995
with my airways i oh yeah it's a

4166.719 --> 4170.96
difference

and it's never just oh i'm secretly

4191.279 --> 4194.2390000000005
