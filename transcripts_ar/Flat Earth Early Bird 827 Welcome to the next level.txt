much appreciated

80.4 --> 82.64
so

83.92 --> 88.88
let's see how this works the weather is

89.04 --> 94.4
a little it's not so much cloudy

92.079 --> 98.0
a little bit more hazy but it's actually

94.4 --> 98.0
kind of nice and warm out there

98.4 --> 102.24000000000001
there's been bits of sun

104.56 --> 111.2
but right now it's yeah it's crazy

108.88 --> 113.119
but it's still kind of nice and warm and

111.2 --> 114.07900000000001
complete contrast to yesterday when it

113.119 --> 116.56
was really cold

114.079 --> 116.55999999999999
actually

117.759 --> 124.799
right so it's monday the 8th of

121.439 --> 128.07999999999998
march 2021

124.799 --> 132.56
hello tiny wombo first in chat this

128.08 --> 135.92000000000002
is the new format that well adam

132.56 --> 141.04
pretty much put together

135.92 --> 145.04
and we installed it yesterday

141.04 --> 145.04
and yeah let's try it out

150.239 --> 155.519
yeah i'm not entirely

153.44 --> 157.04
absolutely certain about the setup but

155.519 --> 160.239
this is

157.04 --> 163.84
yeah this is how it is right now

160.239 --> 167.92000000000002
and i was thinking like maybe

163.84 --> 170.4
i feel a little cramped now so maybe

167.92 --> 173.11999999999998
slightly different still but for now i'm

170.4 --> 176.239
going to do it like this

173.12 --> 178.64000000000001
and yeah i this time

176.239 --> 180.56
i have a another type of animated

178.64 --> 184.07999999999998
background that

180.56 --> 188.879
adam managed to get together

184.08 --> 192.87900000000002
or find somewhere so this is basically

188.879 --> 192.879
a location and

193.12 --> 197.36
it comes it's basically a transition

196.159 --> 200.879
from morning

197.36 --> 204.87900000000002
to afternoon to night

200.879 --> 208.879
even so now you right over there

204.879 --> 211.51899999999998
you can see the sun coming up

208.879 --> 212.07999999999998
that's pretty cool i thought it's a

211.519 --> 216.0
quite

212.08 --> 219.76000000000002
beautiful animated picture

216.0 --> 219.76
and i got other backgrounds as well

220.08 --> 229.92000000000002
let's see this one

224.84 --> 229.92000000000002
oh is that working what is this

230.0 --> 237.599
oh it might only work if i

233.84 --> 242.799
switch it i'll find out right now

237.599 --> 242.79899999999998
or or you'll see black ah there you go

243.28 --> 248.48
so when i'm gonna get pissed off about

246.959 --> 251.599
something

248.48 --> 255.84
i'll probably put this on it's pretty

251.599 --> 255.83999999999997
cool huh

265.36 --> 271.199
oh wow

268.56 --> 272.96
sitting in the arch not a fan sorry

271.199 --> 276.639
about that

272.96 --> 283.84
i have no objections to it

276.639 --> 283.84000000000003
arches are pretty cool

292.56 --> 297.04
did you see that adam even put a little

295.199 --> 300.16
early bird logos

297.04 --> 301.91900000000004
logo on there on the arch like

300.16 --> 303.36
he put quite some work into it and

301.919 --> 311.84
there's a scroller bar

303.36 --> 311.84000000000003
up there

322.84 --> 328.79999999999995
right

325.759 --> 328.8
so that's kind of nice

333.84 --> 339.84
went to bed early yesterday it was good

337.12 --> 339.84000000000003
that i did

345.199 --> 356.639
pretty well rested today

352.479 --> 356.639
oh damn it i forgot make notes

356.8 --> 360.96000000000004
i watched a lot of south park yesterday

358.88 --> 362.08
yeah in the evening i felt extremely

360.96 --> 365.28
restless

362.08 --> 367.84
can't really pinpoint it

365.28 --> 367.84
i just did

381.84 --> 384.08
hmm

388.8 --> 391.91900000000004
yeah i i watched a lot of south park

391.039 --> 394.96
yesterday

391.919 --> 398.4
was a good distraction and

394.96 --> 401.44
interesting watching these things

398.4 --> 402.56
like that episode or did this it's like

401.44 --> 405.68
a chain

402.56 --> 409.68
episode where basically

405.68 --> 412.40000000000003
garrison supposedly becomes like trump

409.68 --> 413.44
it is really fascinating though it's

412.4 --> 416.23999999999995
it's a really

413.44 --> 417.84
fascinating funny setup that they put

416.24 --> 419.68
together and back in the day i

417.84 --> 422.31899999999996
really didn't like it because i thought

419.68 --> 425.36
like oh there's radar calling trump and

422.319 --> 429.12
i was kind of caught up

425.36 --> 431.12
but in retrospect it is just really

429.12 --> 435.44
funny now

431.12 --> 438.4
so i enjoyed a lot of south park

435.44 --> 438.4
yesterday evening

439.68 --> 444.479
also was a bit on 24 7 discord again

442.72 --> 446.72
yeah definitely should make a note of

444.479 --> 446.71999999999997
that

449.44 --> 454.24
but yeah there was a lot of rumpusing

451.12 --> 465.84000000000003
going on and i spoke up about that

454.24 --> 465.84000000000003
didn't hang around long

470.72 --> 479.84000000000003
looks better when i don't lean forward

473.28 --> 479.84
into the arch i don't know what you mean

485.36 --> 489.84000000000003
but my issue is that it is a little

488.08 --> 494.24
cramped

489.84 --> 498.08
like i i kind of liked the room

494.24 --> 501.12
but yeah there is not much of that

498.08 --> 503.75899999999996
and i see that as a problem

501.12 --> 504.72
so it's like a design issue and i'm

503.759 --> 507.039
going to work on it

504.72 --> 508.47900000000004
like everything's pretty much set up i

507.039 --> 510.96
can

508.479 --> 512.08
tinker it like i used to do that with

510.96 --> 514.959
the other format

512.08 --> 516.32
the older formats as well i can and i

514.959 --> 521.8389999999999
will do that

516.32 --> 521.839
but for now it's gonna be like this

525.6 --> 527.9200000000001
what

529.12 --> 535.839
the ark on the screen captures your head

532.839 --> 535.839
what

545.839 --> 550.5600000000001
oh hello by the way brent m good to see

548.32 --> 550.5600000000001
you

551.519 --> 557.2
i got a super chat or paypal yesterday

554.399 --> 560.64
but i don't know who it was from

557.2 --> 563.6800000000001
but whoever it was thank you very much

560.64 --> 566.399
i really appreciate that

563.68 --> 567.68
and i need it as i've been trying to

566.399 --> 571.12
communicate

567.68 --> 571.12
in the last week

571.68 --> 575.8389999999999
so yeah i'll not mention the name i'm

574.16 --> 579.04
just never going to mention the name if

575.839 --> 579.0400000000001
i don't know who it is

580.959 --> 585.1199999999999
but anyway thank you very much for that

583.44 --> 588.9590000000001
if you would like to identify

585.12 --> 591.04
in chat that would be

588.959 --> 593.4399999999999
cool you don't have to if you want to be

591.04 --> 597.279
an anonymous donor that's fine too i

593.44 --> 597.2790000000001
take anonymous donations as well

601.2 --> 605.839
but if you like a shout out then i will

606.72 --> 609.519
and we'll get that

613.6 --> 621.0400000000001
seeing the beau is nice

618.959 --> 622.079
well maybe now people finally stop

621.04 --> 625.92
asking about if

622.079 --> 629.5999999999999
is that a crossbow because

625.92 --> 629.5999999999999
yeah that was getting annoying

630.88 --> 635.8389999999999
but we'll see you know this the arch it

633.68 --> 636.399
was a pretty cool idea adam came up with

635.839 --> 640.1600000000001
it

636.399 --> 641.76
i kind of like it but if eventually i

640.16 --> 645.4399999999999
get a bit dissatisfied and

641.76 --> 648.56
and come to the conclusion that i

645.44 --> 650.399
really want just the full webcam screen

648.56 --> 660.399
on screen in some way

650.399 --> 662.56
then i might replace it

660.399 --> 664.64
like the uh the walking through the

662.56 --> 668.3199999999999
forest type of early bird setup

664.64 --> 671.279
did just have my full screen available

668.32 --> 674.0
and yeah i really do appreciate that

671.279 --> 678.64
having the maneuvering room to have

674.0 --> 678.64
all my hand activities visible as well

681.12 --> 689.839
hello tom parker jose bobington

685.519 --> 689.839
lord of the rings no i don't think so

689.92 --> 694.88
the imagery is not taken it's not

692.72 --> 697.44
involved in any kind of franchise as far

694.88 --> 697.4399999999999
as i know

698.0 --> 703.839
it's pretty cool right you already did

700.0 --> 703.839
have are you seeing the

703.92 --> 717.8389999999999
the changes

729.04 --> 734.399
right so anyway yeah welcome everyone to

733.12 --> 739.04
the new

734.399 --> 742.399
to the next level as i called it

739.04 --> 744.8
i'm the gatekeeper to flat earth

742.399 --> 746.88
all right so how exactly am i gate

744.8 --> 748.079
keeping tiny wumbo i know you're just

746.88 --> 751.279
joking

748.079 --> 754.0
but you also know that i

751.279 --> 754.639
i like to it's my personal preference to

754.0 --> 758.32
take such

754.639 --> 760.8
joke extremely literal so

758.32 --> 761.44
would you care to elaborate exactly how

760.8 --> 767.12
i'm

761.44 --> 767.12
gate keeping flat earth tiny wumbo

770.0 --> 773.839
no i'm not gonna use a green screen

792.639 --> 796.48
okay from now on i'm going to turn off

794.88 --> 798.959
my phone before i start the show

796.48 --> 801.6
because this grim fee guy and i know

798.959 --> 804.079
it's him he's constantly doing is very

801.6 --> 804.0790000000001
annoying

806.399 --> 810.16
so yeah grim feet it's very funny i'm

808.8 --> 813.519
gonna just turn off

810.16 --> 816.399
the the phone every time right

813.519 --> 817.279
so your stupid little jokes not gonna

816.399 --> 820.8
work

817.279 --> 823.6
stalker yeah

820.8 --> 829.8389999999999
phone stalker you that you you're a

823.6 --> 829.839
phone stalker

832.72 --> 837.36
it does look a little cramped in the

834.32 --> 837.36
arch yeah i know

837.519 --> 843.839
thinner exactly that was my thought as

840.839 --> 843.839
well

846.079 --> 849.519
yeah but i'm not going to dutch sailor i

848.88 --> 851.4399999999999
don't

849.519 --> 852.5600000000001
use green screens i don't have the

851.44 --> 855.44
freaking room

852.56 --> 856.0
for starters and i don't want to i don't

855.44 --> 859.1990000000001
like green

856.0 --> 859.6
screens i like there really is level i

859.199 --> 863.04
like

859.6 --> 864.48
real things real visuals not some weird

863.04 --> 869.279
tinkered with visual

864.48 --> 873.279
thanks so i'm not never going to do that

869.279 --> 874.399
get it never ever i don't want to i

873.279 --> 877.279
don't need to

874.399 --> 878.079
i'm perfectly fine as i am if anything

877.279 --> 881.36
i'd prefer

878.079 --> 884.56
to just get a better room

881.36 --> 889.04
and then just make an interesting real

884.56 --> 889.04
background not green screen

890.48 --> 895.9200000000001
yeah i do have a small room i can barely

892.48 --> 895.9200000000001
stack my own stuff in here

896.399 --> 906.079
i know i know that's okay dutch theater

901.92 --> 909.68
i know i i reacted a little uh

906.079 --> 912.079
a little agitated it's just that

909.68 --> 913.12
no like every time somebody brings it up

912.079 --> 915.92
no no

913.12 --> 916.88
no no i don't like green screen i don't

915.92 --> 920.3199999999999
want green screen

916.88 --> 923.68
i don't want special effects camera

920.32 --> 925.9200000000001
as is always always i'm never going to

923.68 --> 926.88
go on that stupid bandwagon i think it's

925.92 --> 930.16
goofy

926.88 --> 930.16
i think it is useless

930.8 --> 937.519
hey if you're going to make some

933.839 --> 939.9200000000001
theatrical thing that's another matter

937.519 --> 941.519
right if you're going to improvise your

939.92 --> 944.8
own theater with

941.519 --> 946.639
graphics added on and all that yeah of

944.8 --> 948.88
course you're going to use green screen

946.639 --> 950.88
because otherwise it's going to be very

948.88 --> 952.72
messy

950.88 --> 954.8
i've seen people use green screen

952.72 --> 958.32
successfully i'm not going to do it

954.8 --> 958.3199999999999
because that is not what i do

960.0 --> 965.12
hello richard simmons and simon then

965.44 --> 973.44
now there's a man

968.72 --> 977.839
called dan that i don't want to be

973.44 --> 977.839
i can always pop by my chat if he wants

977.92 --> 981.4399999999999
what is up with the sound it sucks and

979.92 --> 983.8389999999999
there's nothing i can do about it at

981.44 --> 983.839
this time

984.48 --> 989.279
oh a question let me guess southern star

987.36 --> 996.32
rotations

989.279 --> 999.199
yeah is it southern star rotations

996.32 --> 1000.399
there's only only so many smart ass

999.199 --> 1003.92
questions that you

1000.399 --> 1003.92
come up with anyway so

1005.36 --> 1011.519
yeah yeah you're gonna get a timeout for

1008.839 --> 1014.639
that

1011.519 --> 1017.759
next time pay attention

1014.639 --> 1020.88
yeah just addressed it are you deaf

1017.759 --> 1023.92
are you literally deaf i literally

1020.88 --> 1025.12
just addressed that as you were on

1023.92 --> 1027.6
screen

1025.12 --> 1028.1599999999999
yeah i'm not going to keep repeating

1027.6 --> 1031.1989999999998
myself

but i i guess i'll keep it i guess i'll

1299.2 --> 1305.8400000000001

what is a reference frame

1857.84 --> 1864.1589999999999
a reference frame is is

1860.88 --> 1867.44
a technical terminology that refers

1864.159 --> 1871.0390000000002
haha reference frame that refers to

1867.44 --> 1874.24
motion in relation to

1871.039 --> 1877.679
something else that is not in the same

1874.24 --> 1878.799
reference frame right so there's motion

1877.679 --> 1882.799
in relation to

1878.799 --> 1885.44
other motion or non-motion actually

1882.799 --> 1887.12
stationary things that's where reference

1885.44 --> 1890.3990000000001
frames comes in

1887.12 --> 1893.039
it's all about motion and the relation

1890.399 --> 1893.84
of a thing in motion in relation to

1893.039 --> 1896.64
something else

1893.84 --> 1907.84
not in that motion that's basically what

1896.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
reference frames are all about

1909.039 --> 1913.039
how is he recording is he going to make

not giving a [ __ ] about your freaking

1981.6 --> 1985.36
supposed income

1983.039 --> 1987.6
about the supposed respect from a bunch

1985.36 --> 1990.559
of sheep you get

1987.6 --> 1991.12
oh so many followers that are literally

1990.559 --> 1994.6399999999999
all

1991.12 --> 1998.1589999999999
trash trash people

1994.64 --> 2000.0
right people that follow simon dan are

1998.159 --> 2004.3990000000001
so trashy

2000.0 --> 2007.039
they're so repulsive in nature

2004.399 --> 2008.6399999999999
that i don't yeah you can't even say

2007.039 --> 2011.919
that's bots

2008.64 --> 2015.1200000000001
because the such ugliness

2011.919 --> 2017.039
is very hard to emulate properly

2015.12 --> 2018.9599999999998
right for bots bots are very

2017.039 --> 2020.08
standardized well these people that

2018.96 --> 2021.8400000000001
follow him

2020.08 --> 2023.279
i bet there are really a lot of them

2021.84 --> 2027.84
that are real

2023.279 --> 2030.64
but they just happen to be total trash

2027.84 --> 2030.6399999999999
look at the plane

2031.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
see that that's pretty cool right

2050.48 --> 2055.119
all right well tara 306 i think with

2052.72 --> 2056.1589999999997
simon dan it's extra tragic because i

2055.119 --> 2059.44
think that simon

2056.159 --> 2062.0
then does have the potential

2059.44 --> 2062.879
to be a halfway decent and smart human

2062.0 --> 2066.0
being

2062.879 --> 2070.399
he's just not doing it he's

2066.0 --> 2070.399
literally surrendering to trash

2070.72 --> 2076.24
he thinks it's a strategy to surrender

2073.599 --> 2077.9190000000003
to trash

2076.24 --> 2079.7599999999998
things that makes him special he thinks

2077.919 --> 2082.1589999999997
it doesn't matter there's no morality

2079.76 --> 2082.159
there's no

2082.8 --> 2086.079
what do you mean it rubs off on him what

2085.679 --> 2089.52
he

2086.079 --> 2092.5600000000004
he assumes people don't differentiate

2089.52 --> 2103.839
he assumes people don't see

2092.56 --> 2103.839
what is real what is [ __ ]

2114.839 --> 2117.839
so

2119.839 --> 2131.839
sociopathy is not normal no it's not

2133.76 --> 2137.0400000000004
yeah i got a lot of trolls

2139.44 --> 2143.28
that's right i guess the layout has is

2142.24 --> 2147.359
getting some

2143.28 --> 2149.599
attention certain

2147.359 --> 2151.119
people just don't like it they're now oh

2149.599 --> 2154.1600000000003
there's something new happening

2151.119 --> 2156.48
in our boring shitty little lives

2154.16 --> 2158.96
where we're staring from our safe spaces

2156.48 --> 2160.8
to other people

2158.96 --> 2164.079
right that actually do try to do

2160.8 --> 2166.6400000000003
something meaningful

2164.079 --> 2168.88
and so they're like oh the cockroaches

2166.64 --> 2170.72
are all scouring oh god the fridge is

2168.88 --> 2171.44
being moved oh god that means they have

2170.72 --> 2175.5989999999997
to

2171.44 --> 2175.599
run in all directions now that's what's

2184.839 --> 2187.839
happening

2199.2 --> 2202.64
yeah why don't you try that again

2211.04 --> 2214.4
all right so something new if there's

2212.64 --> 2216.48
something new

2214.4 --> 2218.48
you know if there is a change if there's

2216.48 --> 2219.599
a change in a certain consistency

2218.48 --> 2222.2400000000002
patterns

2219.599 --> 2223.44
then all the trolls all the all those

2222.24 --> 2225.9199999999996
scumbags

2223.44 --> 2229.04
that literally have no life and focus

2225.92 --> 2230.48
only on trying to tear others down like

2229.04 --> 2232.24
crabs in a bucket

2230.48 --> 2233.599
assuming that those other people they're

2232.24 --> 2236.7999999999997
targeting are crabs too

2233.599 --> 2240.6400000000003
which they're not right just gonna step

2236.8 --> 2243.44
on you so yeah as soon as something

2240.64 --> 2245.1189999999997
actually changes and with me my show

2243.44 --> 2247.44
things don't really change around that

2245.119 --> 2247.44
much

2247.68 --> 2261.52
right i'm very persistent

2258.079 --> 2261.52
i don't like a lot of changes

2263.44 --> 2267.2000000000003
so when it changes yeah of course

2265.359 --> 2267.92
immediately all the cockroaches all

2267.2 --> 2270.24
start

2267.92 --> 2271.6800000000003
jumping up and running around oh look

2270.24 --> 2275.5989999999997
we're special oh

2271.68 --> 2276.72
let's let's let's [ __ ] all over this new

2275.599 --> 2285.6800000000003
thing

2276.72 --> 2287.4399999999996
right got no life

2285.68 --> 2289.2799999999997
you weirdos get off on toying with the

2287.44 --> 2293.119
feeble minded oh so you mean

2289.28 --> 2297.119
you runny nuts you yeah that's right

2293.119 --> 2299.52
we do get off on toying with you

2297.119 --> 2300.7200000000003
feeble-minded retards that's correct

2299.52 --> 2304.0
runny nuts

2300.72 --> 2307.9199999999996
we do because your pieces are [ __ ]

2304.0 --> 2311.04
you are a detriment to the world

2307.92 --> 2314.4
you are a psychological burden on

2311.04 --> 2317.04
the truth an uncommon human decency

2314.4 --> 2318.079
and the preponderance of your presence

2317.04 --> 2321.04
is a literal

2318.079 --> 2323.3590000000004
demonic influence on humanity that's

2321.04 --> 2323.359
right

2324.839 --> 2327.839
[ __ ]

2330.8 --> 2333.8390000000004
so if we're going to rip you a new one

2332.96 --> 2337.04
and tear you

2333.839 --> 2339.359
down for the demon scumbags you are

2337.04 --> 2341.839
might as just as well enjoy it that's

2339.359 --> 2341.839
right

2351.2 --> 2356.48
yeah laugh it up fundy laugh it up

2366.839 --> 2372.0
wow having trouble with your keyboard

2370.8 --> 2383.8390000000004
simon dan

2372.0 --> 2383.839
where's your question

2395.52 --> 2399.839
i don't know but you have to move out

2397.44 --> 2403.68
right now

2399.839 --> 2405.7599999999998
huh huh [ __ ] it get out get the [ __ ] out

2403.68 --> 2406.96
ah there you go another one not a piece

2405.76 --> 2409.44
of [ __ ]

2406.96 --> 2411.839
oh damn it other people are beating me

2409.44 --> 2411.839
to it

2414.88 --> 2419.52
yeah and just for the record i'm

2417.28 --> 2422.5600000000004
actually kind of enjoying because i do

2419.52 --> 2425.599
feel like literally

2422.56 --> 2428.72
just ripping [ __ ]

2425.599 --> 2430.88
like you apart i do enjoy the time so in

2428.72 --> 2433.1189999999997
a way i'm actually kind of glad that the

2430.88 --> 2437.359
trolls are here

2433.119 --> 2440.48
so i yeah just enjoy ripping you up

2437.359 --> 2442.0789999999997
i do enjoy it i i can be kind of

2440.48 --> 2446.16
sadistic like that

2442.079 --> 2449.599
but yeah even the the loveliest

2446.16 --> 2452.64
most sensitive and caring

2449.599 --> 2455.52
like deeply caring people

2452.64 --> 2457.04
can become absolute monsters when yeah

2455.52 --> 2459.7599999999998
half the world is just

2457.04 --> 2460.64
constantly pushing them from all

2459.76 --> 2462.88
directions

2460.64 --> 2463.7599999999998
but not giving them anything only

2462.88 --> 2467.28
tearing down yeah

2463.76 --> 2470.2400000000002
eventually every angel can be turned

2467.28 --> 2472.0
into a demon but guess what there's a

2470.24 --> 2476.0789999999997
bit of a difference between

2472.0 --> 2479.28
that type of demonic behavior

2476.079 --> 2482.2400000000002
and just ground grass roots

2479.28 --> 2485.28
level demonic behavior because an angel

2482.24 --> 2489.68
actually turns back to normal

2485.28 --> 2493.2000000000003
after right the attacks

2489.68 --> 2497.44
stop guess what happens to

2493.2 --> 2500.0789999999997
the real demons oh

2497.44 --> 2502.079
yeah they have nothing to turn back to

2500.079 --> 2504.4
normal to

2502.079 --> 2504.4
ah

2505.28 --> 2511.52
yeah that's right

2508.8 --> 2513.119
and you stick to the lies you get

2511.52 --> 2523.839
nothing in return

2513.119 --> 2523.839
huh yeah enjoy

2532.4 --> 2535.599
oh simon dan still not asking a question

2535.119 --> 2539.44
right

2535.599 --> 2541.44
where's the real question where is it

2539.44 --> 2543.76
oh it's a question about my personal

2541.44 --> 2543.76
life

2546.079 --> 2553.119
how much i know about your personal life

2551.28 --> 2555.119
well i i bet it's it's pretty

2553.119 --> 2557.599
superficial and numpty and i bet

2555.119 --> 2558.319
that you're very well behaved you'll

2557.599 --> 2561.52
shut up

2558.319 --> 2564.72
when anybody tells you in real life

2561.52 --> 2568.16
i bet you i bet you're a weak

2564.72 --> 2570.48
[ __ ] simon dan i bet you're a weak

2568.16 --> 2571.7599999999998
[ __ ] in the real life and nobody gives a

2570.48 --> 2575.599
[ __ ] about you

2571.76 --> 2578.96
because you're weak you're weak spirited

2575.599 --> 2582.079
and you're a coward and a liar

2578.96 --> 2582.7200000000003
you bring forth lies at the first sign

2582.079 --> 2586.0
of threat

2582.72 --> 2589.2
because you're a [ __ ] simon then

2586.0 --> 2592.72
how do i know that i know that

2589.2 --> 2594.16
from experience right if you bump into

2592.72 --> 2595.1189999999997
somebody they have certain types of

2594.16 --> 2597.5989999999997
behavior

2595.119 --> 2598.7200000000003
then guess what i get to cross-reference

2597.599 --> 2600.6400000000003
that

2598.72 --> 2602.48
with my experience with other people

2600.64 --> 2603.68
with that behavior and what i learned

2602.48 --> 2607.44
about them

2603.68 --> 2611.68
yeah i can i can simon that

2607.44 --> 2614.16
that's how i divine your personal life

2611.68 --> 2616.16
i cross reference your behavior your

2614.16 --> 2619.68
universal behavior

2616.16 --> 2621.92
with other people in my life in the past

2619.68 --> 2622.7999999999997
that have had that type of attitude in

2621.92 --> 2625.92
spirit

2622.8 --> 2627.119
yeah so i can't figure it out is that

2625.92 --> 2635.839
scary to you

2627.119 --> 2635.839
is that scary huh

2647.2 --> 2653.68
i bet simon dan thinks of himself

2650.72 --> 2655.839
as a gentleman out there except that

2653.68 --> 2656.24
he's a complete coward and doesn't stick

2655.839 --> 2658.64
up for

2656.24 --> 2659.5989999999997
anyone unless it's like virtual signal

2658.64 --> 2661.2
safe

2659.599 --> 2665.119
then he'll do it because that's what

2661.2 --> 2665.1189999999997
people like simon dan typically do

2670.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
okay xyz i read you a what

2674.839 --> 2677.839
why

2682.64 --> 2691.839
why should i look that up

2695.76 --> 2702.7200000000003
so hey simon then got any real questions

2699.839 --> 2704.319
oh still about your life oh your special

2702.72 --> 2707.359
special life oh

2704.319 --> 2710.88
man maybe if you keep it a secret

2707.359 --> 2713.92
your life people will start caring

2710.88 --> 2717.52
maybe that mystery will be just

2713.92 --> 2719.599
you know you're such a lame [ __ ]

2717.52 --> 2720.72
that is really freaking dumb and a

2719.599 --> 2722.7200000000003
coward

2720.72 --> 2724.9599999999996
and that double downs on stupidity

2722.72 --> 2728.0
constantly maybe if there was

2724.96 --> 2730.64
a secret about your life

2728.0 --> 2732.48
then maybe that would compel people to

2730.64 --> 2734.16
find you slightly more interesting for

2732.48 --> 2735.04
as long as you keep it a secret though

2734.16 --> 2737.2799999999997
because anything

2735.04 --> 2738.24
real about you is going to be [ __ ]

2737.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
lame

2738.24 --> 2747.839
guaranteed yeah so good luck

2763.2 --> 2768.0789999999997
no i'm just addressing it so having kids

2766.56 --> 2771.359
is lame

2768.079 --> 2775.76
well you you're lame

2771.359 --> 2776.56
yeah so your kids they're gonna figure

2775.76 --> 2779.599
it out one

2776.56 --> 2780.7999999999997
one day and they're gonna be like okay

2779.599 --> 2785.44
dad

2780.8 --> 2785.44
sure yeah yeah

2785.599 --> 2790.7200000000003
unless you want to not let them develop

2788.8 --> 2793.8390000000004
naturally unless you're going to

2790.72 --> 2796.0
basically put this system on them

2793.839 --> 2797.44
through you instead of actually being a

2796.0 --> 2799.839
real dad

2797.44 --> 2802.2400000000002
right so you're gonna you're gonna shove

2799.839 --> 2806.56
them right in there

2802.24 --> 2806.56
yeah i can see you do that

2808.48 --> 2812.8
so yeah i i don't know i don't think

2811.839 --> 2815.7599999999998
it's such a

2812.8 --> 2817.52
plus for you to have children because

2815.76 --> 2819.0400000000004
what are those children going to have to

2817.52 --> 2820.96
deal with as they grow up

2819.04 --> 2822.4
they're going to have to deal with you

2820.96 --> 2825.28
and your stupidity

2822.4 --> 2826.64
and your cowardice and the behavior that

2825.28 --> 2830.1600000000003
you display

2826.64 --> 2833.44
towards other completely unjustified

2830.16 --> 2835.04
based on lies yeah they're gonna figure

2833.44 --> 2837.92
that out about you

2835.04 --> 2838.4
at some point and they might actually

2837.92 --> 2841.44
start

2838.4 --> 2843.6800000000003
upholding an act towards you

2841.44 --> 2846.64
because they have figured out that you

2843.68 --> 2849.359
are a sniveling coward scumbag

2846.64 --> 2849.92
and you might be nice to them right you

2849.359 --> 2852.7999999999997
might be

2849.92 --> 2853.44
nice to them i'm pretty sure that those

2852.8 --> 2855.28
lies

2853.44 --> 2857.04
that you even uphold towards yourself

2855.28 --> 2859.6800000000003
are gonna rub off on them

2857.04 --> 2861.2799999999997
and they'll pick up on it because kids

2859.68 --> 2864.319
always do simon then

2861.28 --> 2866.48
so have good luck with your kids yeah

2864.319 --> 2867.68
you think you can lie about freaking

2866.48 --> 2870.96
everything

2867.68 --> 2873.839
display your stupidity like that on the

2870.96 --> 2876.319
world yeah your kids are gonna know

2873.839 --> 2877.2
yeah same goes by the way for nathan

2876.319 --> 2880.0
oakley

2877.2 --> 2881.2799999999997
his kids are gonna know what their dad

2880.0 --> 2882.72
is doing

2881.28 --> 2885.28
but i think they're gonna have a

2882.72 --> 2889.04
slightly different response

2885.28 --> 2890.559
yeah i think that nathan's kids

2889.04 --> 2892.88
they're already kind of figuring out

2890.559 --> 2894.4
what's going on and i think that

2892.88 --> 2897.119
they actually are going to be quite

2894.4 --> 2900.1600000000003
impressed as they grow older

2897.119 --> 2903.2000000000003
by just yeah the psychological

2900.16 --> 2903.92
warrior skills that their dad has and

2903.2 --> 2907.2
they're gonna have

2903.92 --> 2907.6800000000003
actual respect for him right that he's

2907.2 --> 2912.16
going

2907.68 --> 2916.16
against the entire world to try to

2912.16 --> 2918.0789999999997
speak the truth physics truth

2916.16 --> 2919.68
actual empirical evidence based truth

2918.079 --> 2920.8
they're gonna there as they're gonna

2919.68 --> 2922.96
grow up they're gonna just

2920.8 --> 2924.6400000000003
have more and more respect for him see

2922.96 --> 2928.8
that's the difference

2924.64 --> 2932.5589999999997
yeah ever thought about that huh

2928.8 --> 2934.96
simon then i bet you didn't didn't you

2932.559 --> 2935.8390000000004
because you don't think about things not

2934.96 --> 2937.359
for long

2935.839 --> 2939.2799999999997
doesn't really work out every time

2937.359 --> 2941.7599999999998
doesn't it because yeah

2939.28 --> 2945.3590000000004
thinking does not lead things to become

2941.76 --> 2945.3590000000004
the way you want them to be

2951.04 --> 2958.5589999999997
oh look at all the angry so angry

2955.2 --> 2958.5589999999997
so angry oh

2958.88 --> 2961.2000000000003
oh

2966.16 --> 2974.0
i'm sorry i'm failed i'm angry so i feel

2970.24 --> 2977.7599999999998
that sad life oh my god i'm so triggered

2974.0 --> 2980.079
i'm so triggered by that oh my god

2977.76 --> 2981.44
man i'm not going to be able to sleep

2980.079 --> 2984.8
from that

2981.44 --> 2987.359
reading that of somebody oh

2984.8 --> 2987.3590000000004
oh no

2987.92 --> 2990.16
oh

2992.319 --> 2996.64
that nathan he's not here to ask

2995.04 --> 2999.839
questions about

2996.64 --> 3002.24
the subjects right flat earth like the

2999.839 --> 3005.599
earth not being a spinning ball

3002.24 --> 3007.4399999999996
not being in inside of a vacuum endless

3005.599 --> 3008.88
outer space all that yeah he's not going

3007.44 --> 3011.599
to ask about that

3008.88 --> 3012.2400000000002
because he's a dumb ass he doesn't even

3011.599 --> 3015.76
understand

3012.24 --> 3017.04
basic physics basic physics you know the

3015.76 --> 3020.48
thing

3017.04 --> 3022.88
that 11 and 12 years old people

3020.48 --> 3024.72
learn in school he doesn't even

3022.88 --> 3026.319
understand that

3024.72 --> 3028.0
so yeah what is he going to ask about

3026.319 --> 3028.96
he's just going to show oh i got a

3028.0 --> 3031.599
bigger car

3028.96 --> 3032.4
i got a car i'm i'm worth something i

3031.599 --> 3034.6400000000003
got kids

3032.4 --> 3037.52
oh i'm so important i got all these

3034.64 --> 3041.1189999999997
subscribers i got an ink oh man

3037.52 --> 3043.44
i am so good i am better than everybody

3041.119 --> 3044.6400000000003
that reminds you about physical reality

3043.44 --> 3047.04
how it really works

3044.64 --> 3049.2
the thing you don't understand oh you're

3047.04 --> 3052.5589999999997
so special simon and you're so

3049.2 --> 3052.5589999999997
special um

3064.079 --> 3069.3590000000004
you don't attack my life that's a good

3066.0 --> 3072.88
one simon then

3069.359 --> 3072.88
that's a that's very funny

3080.48 --> 3084.319
that's right nathan he can't cope with

3082.8 --> 3085.76
his own words because there's all kinds

3084.319 --> 3088.079
of [ __ ] coming out of him

3085.76 --> 3090.3190000000004
all the time and he can't control it

3088.079 --> 3091.2000000000003
because he is a dumbass and he can't

3090.319 --> 3095.599
even

3091.2 --> 3099.04
fix the [ __ ] that comes out of his mouth

3095.599 --> 3102.2400000000002
he's the kind of guy that metaphorically

3099.04 --> 3104.24
can't wipe his own ass when there's [ __ ]

3102.24 --> 3105.68
coming out of it he doesn't know how to

3104.24 --> 3110.8799999999997
wipe it off

3105.68 --> 3114.16
he's that stupid

3110.88 --> 3116.6400000000003
yeah he doesn't

3114.16 --> 3118.0
know how to deal with the stupidity that

3116.64 --> 3125.839
comes out of himself

3118.0 --> 3125.839
he doesn't know how to deal with it

3136.319 --> 3142.64
okay xyz it's antarctica

3139.92 --> 3145.04
oh is it is it the fake circle video the

3142.64 --> 3145.5989999999997
edited video the only video of the

3145.04 --> 3148.64
supposed

3145.599 --> 3151.44
24-hour sun on the antarctica

3148.64 --> 3152.0
that one is it that one that thing

3151.44 --> 3154.64
that's been

3152.0 --> 3157.119
addressed for like five years is it that

3154.64 --> 3157.1189999999997
one huh

3161.68 --> 3165.2
antarctic circle said yeah it is that

3163.92 --> 3167.359
one yeah

3165.2 --> 3168.24
ah well i've already referenced that a

3167.359 --> 3172.72
lot of the time

3168.24 --> 3175.9199999999996
yeah i know about that video xyz

3172.72 --> 3178.319
it's it's doctored yeah it is

3175.92 --> 3180.079
it's doctored it's a doctored video

3178.319 --> 3183.44
there's only one video out there

3180.079 --> 3187.44
and it's doctored probably huh

3183.44 --> 3190.2400000000002
you don't like that you don't like it

3187.44 --> 3192.319
well why didn't you go there and try to

3190.24 --> 3195.2799999999997
make one of those videos yourself

3192.319 --> 3197.599
maybe you could just do it natural so

3195.28 --> 3201.3590000000004
that people don't think it's doctored

3197.599 --> 3205.52
right oh it's not gonna work out then

3201.359 --> 3208.24
oh how unexpected

3205.52 --> 3208.8
maybe that's kind of revealing as to why

3208.24 --> 3212.0789999999997
there is

3208.8 --> 3215.76
only one video of it

3212.079 --> 3217.8390000000004
out there huh

3215.76 --> 3220.079
because it's doctored because if it

3217.839 --> 3221.2
wasn't people could just say oh screw

3220.079 --> 3224.2400000000002
this

3221.2 --> 3225.7599999999998
i'm gonna do it too it's cool why not

3224.24 --> 3228.24
it's pretty cool right

3225.76 --> 3229.44
yeah there should be like 50 of those

3228.24 --> 3232.0
videos

3229.44 --> 3232.96
spread out over time by with different

3232.0 --> 3236.16
equipment

3232.96 --> 3251.839
different people all that there's not

3236.16 --> 3251.839
there isn't any yeah

3257.839 --> 3266.4
it's about qatar sister and what is that

3261.04 --> 3266.4
qatar's is too okay

3268.16 --> 3275.2799999999997
hot horses tur it's a song

3273.2 --> 3279.16
qatar says to antarctica is that not a

3275.28 --> 3283.2000000000003
song challenge

3279.16 --> 3286.48
circumnavigation already seen that

3283.2 --> 3291.04
yeah yay he's

3286.48 --> 3293.359
going around in a circle i'm sure he is

3291.04 --> 3296.319
oh wait no he's actually not going

3293.359 --> 3296.319
around in a circle

3297.68 --> 3301.9199999999996
he's just going around in sort of a

3300.64 --> 3305.44
circle

3301.92 --> 3307.599
on the projection of the map

3305.44 --> 3310.16
right so they could just mean just as

3307.599 --> 3312.0
well as going just in a straight line

3310.16 --> 3315.5989999999997
pretty sure it didn't have a gyroscope

3312.0 --> 3319.76
that eventually ended up to 360 degrees

3315.599 --> 3323.28
ah oh there's no reference of that

3319.76 --> 3326.0
they're not even trying to prove that

3323.28 --> 3326.96
why not i thought it's supposed to be a

3326.0 --> 3330.319
ball proof

3326.96 --> 3332.48
isn't it having a gyroscope on your ship

3330.319 --> 3334.0
even standard and then you go around and

3332.48 --> 3337.119
then you can just show oh look

3334.0 --> 3340.319
over the course of this entire travel

3337.119 --> 3340.88
the gyroscope as we kept it spinning 24

3340.319 --> 3345.2799999999997
7

3340.88 --> 3348.319
the entire trip it turned 360 degrees

3345.28 --> 3351.76
yeah you didn't do that

3348.319 --> 3352.079
oh well guess what that means you didn't

3351.76 --> 3355.44
go

3352.079 --> 3359.119
around an island it means

3355.44 --> 3362.799
you went around a projection

3359.119 --> 3365.6800000000003
that simply displayed in that fashion

3362.799 --> 3367.44
and could just win a straight line right

3365.68 --> 3369.1189999999997
you don't know that

3367.44 --> 3370.799
because you didn't keep track you didn't

3369.119 --> 3373.44
put a gyroscope in there that

3370.799 --> 3374.48
would eventually end up turning 360

3373.44 --> 3375.92
degrees

3374.48 --> 3378.0
yeah you didn't think of that nobody

3375.92 --> 3379.76
thought of that because they don't want

3378.0 --> 3383.599
to think of that because that [ __ ]

3379.76 --> 3383.599
reveals it's not a freaking island

3388.839 --> 3391.839
huh

3400.64 --> 3404.64
oh yeah thank you jose bomington i will

3402.88 --> 3407.599
stay absolutely fine

3404.64 --> 3407.5989999999997
i'm doing good

3408.64 --> 3414.0789999999997
i've decided to significantly cut down

3412.079 --> 3417.28
on my cannabis use

3414.079 --> 3417.28
very significantly

3417.359 --> 3420.96
and it's working out so far

3425.76 --> 3430.6400000000003
and it's gonna save some money also i

3428.4 --> 3432.559
got a super chat donation through paypal

3430.64 --> 3434.64
from somebody

3432.559 --> 3437.0400000000004
to uh yeah yesterday evening i don't

3434.64 --> 3438.5589999999997
know who it is though

3437.04 --> 3442.72
and i'm not gonna name the literal

3438.559 --> 3442.7200000000003
address so whoever that was thank you

3443.2 --> 3447.839
please keep coming it's you know

3448.079 --> 3450.799
still need it

3452.16 --> 3455.5989999999997
i got debts that are kind of piling and

3455.2 --> 3458.16
they're

3455.599 --> 3459.44
like getting pushy so i'm gonna get fees

3458.16 --> 3462.5589999999997
like i'm gonna have to pay

3459.44 --> 3463.839
fees on my debt at some point if it's

3462.559 --> 3468.079
not gonna stop

3463.839 --> 3470.4
part of the reason why i decided to

3468.079 --> 3472.8390000000004
dramatically cut down on the cannabis

3470.4 --> 3475.839
because it is kind of an expensive thing

3472.839 --> 3475.839
unfortunately

3483.599 --> 3491.04
bang it reset

3488.24 --> 3492.64
it's too bad that the the video doesn't

3491.04 --> 3495.68
it's an hour cycle

3492.64 --> 3499.52
didn't you notice that

3495.68 --> 3502.319
it's too bad it doesn't literally reset

3499.52 --> 3503.28
that it kind of like pops back to being

3502.319 --> 3504.799
morning

3503.28 --> 3506.799
that's the only downside of the

3504.799 --> 3517.839
animation other than that it's pretty

3506.799 --> 3517.839
damn cool i think

3525.119 --> 3535.04
okay clutch bear

3530.079 --> 3541.76
well the last time i truly quit

3535.04 --> 3544.799
was in 2002

3541.76 --> 3545.6800000000003
i think 2003 and that really sucked back

3544.799 --> 3547.7599999999998
then

3545.68 --> 3549.04
but that's also because i really didn't

3547.76 --> 3550.88
have

3549.04 --> 3552.88
i still didn't know what the hell to do

3550.88 --> 3555.839
with my life back then

3552.88 --> 3557.839
and then to basically take that away and

3555.839 --> 3560.96
not really have an alternative that's

3557.839 --> 3561.92
kind of punishing i in my current

3560.96 --> 3565.28
position however

3561.92 --> 3565.28
have things to do

3567.52 --> 3571.44
and a project long-term project for

3569.92 --> 3573.92
myself with the show

3571.44 --> 3576.799
and with flat earth and with other

3573.92 --> 3576.799
things as well

3578.72 --> 3583.4399999999996
basically in ways advertising myself

3584.319 --> 3590.0
because that's what i'm doing and it you

3587.04 --> 3590.0
know the trolling

3590.4 --> 3595.92
sometimes it almost makes me think that

3592.88 --> 3600.6400000000003
i'm actually not popular at all

3595.92 --> 3603.76
but then yeah you guys basically

3600.64 --> 3605.1189999999997
reveal in a way unexpected to me that

3603.76 --> 3607.6800000000003
that's not the case

3605.119 --> 3607.6800000000003
thankfully

3608.88 --> 3615.92
right because i'm gonna just

3612.4 --> 3618.4
gonna give this to the trolls yes

3615.92 --> 3620.16
i'm compared to the average pretty

3618.4 --> 3623.6800000000003
easily convinced

3620.16 --> 3627.04
that some that people don't like me

3623.68 --> 3630.24
i i have that unfortunately

3627.04 --> 3632.799
within me that i'm more easily convinced

3630.24 --> 3635.359
that i'm bad than that i'm good and

3632.799 --> 3638.88
that's on a feeling level

3635.359 --> 3643.68
however i've

3638.88 --> 3647.92
learned to deal with it very well

3643.68 --> 3651.5989999999997
because i had to i have to

3647.92 --> 3654.64
also i know how to basically

3651.599 --> 3656.6400000000003
reverse the process when trolls and

3654.64 --> 3660.319
nasty people engage

3656.64 --> 3664.16
by getting pretty hardcore and straight

3660.319 --> 3665.599
to their minds to them unexpectedly

3664.16 --> 3668.319
because they don't understand

3665.599 --> 3668.799
that i can do that they don't know how i

3668.319 --> 3671.2799999999997
do it

3668.799 --> 3672.48
even though i'm describing it to them as

3671.28 --> 3675.52
i do it

3672.48 --> 3677.359
they still don't understand it's just

3675.52 --> 3679.52
flustered by it

3677.359 --> 3680.88
right so i got training i got training

3679.52 --> 3683.359
because of that

3680.88 --> 3684.0
i guess you could say weakness a lot of

3683.359 --> 3687.04
training

3684.0 --> 3689.359
life long training yeah

3687.04 --> 3694.0
in school back in my day when i was

3689.359 --> 3694.0
young pre-teens and post-teens

3694.319 --> 3697.359
i didn't get a lot of respect from

3696.079 --> 3701.8390000000004
people

3697.359 --> 3701.839
now my attitude wasn't all that great

3703.04 --> 3709.119
but yeah

3706.559 --> 3710.559
i just did i just didn't like going

3709.119 --> 3714.079
along with a group

3710.559 --> 3716.88
when they group is acting like [ __ ]

3714.079 --> 3718.6400000000003
or being very dumb or very surrenderist

3716.88 --> 3720.7200000000003
i hate that i've always

3718.64 --> 3722.72
hated that i've hated that when i was

3720.72 --> 3726.72
born

3722.72 --> 3731.2
i hate surrenderists i really do

3726.72 --> 3731.2
surrenderists make everything worse

3738.839 --> 3742.64
everything

3740.0 --> 3743.359
so yeah instead of having a weakness i

3742.64 --> 3746.5589999999997
have a

3743.359 --> 3748.16
lifelong project a battle against the

3746.559 --> 3752.7200000000003
world

3748.16 --> 3752.72
that one way or another i'm going to win

3753.2 --> 3756.8799999999997
because i'm not the only one with the

3756.319 --> 3759.2
issue

3756.88 --> 3760.0
that the world is now getting filled

3759.2 --> 3764.2799999999997
with people

3760.0 --> 3768.4
that are horrific nasty

3764.28 --> 3773.119
egotistical like mercilessly

3768.4 --> 3773.119
evil towards others merciless

3780.839 --> 3787.119
right to others as an individual

3784.319 --> 3787.839
right not the facts because when it

3787.119 --> 3791.119
comes to

3787.839 --> 3794.799
actual facts reasoning

3791.119 --> 3798.6400000000003
logic physics

3794.799 --> 3802.079
yeah i think it is absolutely

3798.64 --> 3806.799
good it's good to ram

3802.079 --> 3810.0
people in their faces metaphorically

3806.799 --> 3813.119
spiritually when they are doubling down

3810.0 --> 3814.64
on provable error yeah

3813.119 --> 3816.4
that's a big difference it's a big

3814.64 --> 3818.4
difference when somebody talks about

3816.4 --> 3820.88
physics and there's bullshittery and

3818.4 --> 3824.079
trolling going on with that

3820.88 --> 3826.2400000000002
and just reinforce stupidity as to when

3824.079 --> 3828.88
it comes to somebody's personal life

3826.24 --> 3830.319
it's slightly different right should

3828.88 --> 3833.76
nobody should ever

3830.319 --> 3836.4
mercilessly attack somebody for their

3833.76 --> 3839.3590000000004
personal life like that

3836.4 --> 3840.96
but when it comes to absolute stupidity

3839.359 --> 3843.2
and provable error

3840.96 --> 3846.16
and holding on to that error i think you

3843.2 --> 3849.359
should absolutely

3846.16 --> 3852.48
slap them in the face with

3849.359 --> 3857.5989999999997
their error until they concede

3852.48 --> 3862.64
or die because it is a provable error

3857.599 --> 3864.559
yeah course concede or die

3862.64 --> 3866.0789999999997
if it is an error if it's a provable

3864.559 --> 3869.44
error you will be

3866.079 --> 3873.119
smacked in the face with it until you

3869.44 --> 3875.359
concede or die you understand

3873.119 --> 3877.92
it's never going to stop because it is

3875.359 --> 3880.0789999999997
an error and it needs to be corrected

3877.92 --> 3881.839
and the one making the error needs to

3880.079 --> 3883.92
correct it and if you don't do it

3881.839 --> 3886.64
for whatever [ __ ] reason you conjure

3883.92 --> 3890.16
up doesn't matter

3886.64 --> 3892.64
you will concede to the error or

3890.16 --> 3894.72
just deal with it the rest of your life

3892.64 --> 3899.52
until you die

3894.72 --> 3899.52
because we're not going to forget

3920.839 --> 3923.839
hmm

3948.839 --> 3951.839
wow

3954.319 --> 3957.359
how to mems

3958.0 --> 3961.76
wait is that

3962.64 --> 3966.72
no that's not something else

3972.24 --> 3979.0389999999998
what is mems i don't remember what that

3974.88 --> 3981.839
stands for

3979.039 --> 3983.2000000000003
yeah there is no proof against relative

3981.839 --> 3986.64
density however

3983.2 --> 3990.16
despite whatever anybody thinks

3986.64 --> 3993.7599999999998
or references relative density works

3990.16 --> 3996.16
always always it really

3993.76 --> 3997.2000000000003
should be just made into a natural law

3996.16 --> 4001.52
because there is

3997.2 --> 4004.8799999999997
no proof against it ever ever

4001.52 --> 4008.559
it does what it does it is a phenomenon

4004.88 --> 4011.44
and it's always there that's why

4008.559 --> 4012.96
yeah it's just proven and you can prove

4011.44 --> 4014.7200000000003
it scientifically but it should

4012.96 --> 4016.96
probably just be made into a law but

4014.72 --> 4021.839
there's nothing there's no exceptions

4016.96 --> 4021.839
to it ever

4024.0 --> 4027.839
whatever anybody's going to claim in

4025.76 --> 4030.1600000000003
here or out there

4027.839 --> 4032.88
doesn't matter you could make up

4030.16 --> 4033.7599999999998
thousands of pages of just so story

4032.88 --> 4036.0
[ __ ]

4033.76 --> 4037.599
it's not gonna disprove it because every

4036.0 --> 4040.16
demonstration proves it

4037.599 --> 4041.039
every demonstration every conceivable

4040.16 --> 4044.5589999999997
setup

4041.039 --> 4047.76
proves relative density how it works

4044.559 --> 4051.119
what it's gonna do perfectly predictable

4047.76 --> 4052.2400000000002
every single time whatever chaos you're

4051.119 --> 4054.6400000000003
going to create

4052.24 --> 4055.4399999999996
it's going to work out because relative

4054.64 --> 4058.48
density

4055.44 --> 4062.16
is scientific fact there's

4058.48 --> 4065.839
nothing you could do about it nothing

4062.16 --> 4068.64
nothing only on purpose misunderstand

4065.839 --> 4071.0389999999998
play stupid and see that as oh maybe

4068.64 --> 4071.839
people will fall for me being stupid

4071.039 --> 4074.2400000000002
about it

4071.839 --> 4076.0
as it being some kind of a proof like a

4074.24 --> 4078.24
deceiving scumbag

4076.0 --> 4079.359
right when it comes to actual

4078.24 --> 4083.7599999999998
understanding there is

4079.359 --> 4087.5989999999997
nothing you can do about it it's proven

4083.76 --> 4091.8390000000004
it works always always

4087.599 --> 4091.839
no exception

4102.839 --> 4105.839
ah

4124.159 --> 4133.839
all right hello moon the young busy girl

4144.839 --> 4147.839
uh

4176.48 --> 4183.12
wow simon dan really shut up didn't he

4180.88 --> 4189.839
he never even asked a physics question

4183.12 --> 4189.839
he's so pathetic

4215.84 --> 4217.92
you

4230.56 --> 4234.88
yeah well maybe i got a little bit to

4232.8 --> 4235.6
him there were three or six when i

4234.88 --> 4237.52
basically

4235.6 --> 4240.320000000001
revealed to him that his children are

4237.52 --> 4240.320000000001
gonna grow up

4240.64 --> 4244.159000000001
the way that i described he probably

4243.52 --> 4247.4400000000005
felt it

4244.159 --> 4250.0
that probably hit home because it's real

4247.44 --> 4251.839999999999
yeah i didn't make that up i did not

4250.0 --> 4255.76
make that up to troll him

4251.84 --> 4258.8
yeah that's real that's why

4255.76 --> 4260.96
that's why he probably just dripped out

4258.8 --> 4262.8
because it was a little confronting and

4260.96 --> 4265.04
confronting about something that he's

4262.8 --> 4268.159000000001
gonna have to deal with in the future

4265.04 --> 4270.84
huh huh simon that

4268.159 --> 4273.839999999999
yeah that's the consequences of your

4270.84 --> 4273.84
actions

4282.8 --> 4286.96
am i planning to get kids and i said

4284.8 --> 4288.88
well i have to have a reliable partner

4286.96 --> 4291.6
for that first

4288.88 --> 4291.6
but yes

4291.92 --> 4295.92
the way things are going i'm probably

4294.0 --> 4297.199
gonna be pretty old when i first get

4295.92 --> 4300.8
kids but when i do

4297.199 --> 4303.28
i'm gonna like try to ram out a whole

4300.8 --> 4303.28
bunch of them

4303.679 --> 4308.8
if the wife can

4309.92 --> 4314.2390000000005
who knows who knows what my entire life

4312.48 --> 4317.839999999999
setup is going to be in the future

4314.239 --> 4321.04
maybe he'll work very differently

4317.84 --> 4323.84
by then but i'm definitely

4321.04 --> 4325.6
planning to get kids it's just i don't

4323.84 --> 4329.1990000000005
want to be

4325.6 --> 4331.1990000000005
in this system i don't want to have them

4329.199 --> 4333.36
roll into a system that is literally

4331.199 --> 4336.0
going to try to mentally and emotionally

4333.36 --> 4336.719
[ __ ] them up with anti-human

4336.0 --> 4340.84
conditioning

4336.719 --> 4343.679
[ __ ] climate change garbage

4340.84 --> 4347.12
was non-sexual

4343.679 --> 4348.0
binary [ __ ] like i'm not gonna

4347.12 --> 4351.679
accept that

4348.0 --> 4357.84
at all and it's probably very tough to

4351.679 --> 4357.84
get away from that now

4362.08 --> 4366.5599999999995
have kids yes making making babies with

4365.76 --> 4371.84
my dick

4366.56 --> 4371.84
in a woman yes that

4410.84 --> 4413.84
okay

4423.92 --> 4429.4400000000005
don't say it that way you will regret it

4428.0 --> 4431.44
when you see them what the hell are you

4429.44 --> 4432.879999999999
talking about

4431.44 --> 4441.839999999999
what do you mean don't say it that way

4432.88 --> 4441.84
that's the way it works

4444.64 --> 4449.6
yeah i know i know dutch sailor that's

4447.28 --> 4449.599999999999
why

4452.64 --> 4455.92
i don't want to surrender my children to

4455.199 --> 4459.199
this

4455.92 --> 4461.84
mind control anti-human system

4459.199 --> 4464.639999999999
that well the netherlands is blatantly a

4461.84 --> 4464.64
part of as well

4467.52 --> 4471.4400000000005
but before i even can consider having

4470.96 --> 4474.4800000000005
children

4471.44 --> 4476.879999999999
i must find a woman that i find freaking

4474.48 --> 4478.879999999999
attractive is going to be important

4476.88 --> 4480.64
that i can actually respect that is

4478.88 --> 4483.92
really freaking smart and that

4480.64 --> 4486.2390000000005
did not surrender to satan yeah

4483.92 --> 4487.1990000000005
that's the most important part have to

4486.239 --> 4490.48
be smart

4487.199 --> 4491.599999999999
woman not surrendered to satan yeah

4490.48 --> 4493.5199999999995
that's kind of tough

4491.6 --> 4494.64
it's very tough to find in this world

4493.52 --> 4497.1990000000005
right now

4494.64 --> 4498.0
yeah somebody is actually willing to

4497.199 --> 4500.48
really

4498.0 --> 4503.76
recognize things for how they work not

4500.48 --> 4507.199
some soften up weenie christian type

4503.76 --> 4508.08
it's like oh no it's all okay it's okay

4507.199 --> 4510.96
just

4508.08 --> 4513.5199999999995
do nice things don't think about how

4510.96 --> 4516.96
demons are totally abusing you

4513.52 --> 4520.4800000000005
using you as naive slaves while they

4516.96 --> 4524.56
literally mentally rip everybody apart

4520.48 --> 4527.28
yeah not that type i don't want that

4524.56 --> 4528.320000000001
i want a real christian woman that's

4527.28 --> 4533.04
going to be like this

4528.32 --> 4535.679

4533.04 --> 4537.5199999999995
children and i want to defend them

4535.679 --> 4541.12
against this [ __ ] up world

4537.52 --> 4543.76
that's what i'm looking for

4541.12 --> 4544.5599999999995
and i'll give a [ __ ] if satan rules this

4543.76 --> 4547.6
world

4544.56 --> 4547.6
i don't give a [ __ ]

4548.32 --> 4553.84
i need somebody that'll just take that

4550.56 --> 4553.84
stand for real

4558.56 --> 4567.84

4603.679 --> 4607.04
[ __ ] link out of you and i'm

4605.28 --> 4610.4
instantly banning you

4607.04 --> 4613.92
answer the questions

4610.4 --> 4616.08
asked by sleeping warrior to you

4613.92 --> 4617.84
with your name in the title of the

4616.08 --> 4620.4
question

4617.84 --> 4621.52
it's not part of the answer you just

4620.4 --> 4625.28
answer them

4621.52 --> 4630.400000000001
yeah most of it should be yes

4625.28 --> 4630.4
no yeah that's an answer not a [ __ ]

4634.84 --> 4637.84
link

4646.0 --> 4651.84
no you didn't

4663.6 --> 4679.84
no he didn't

4692.56 --> 4695.679
right well sleeping worried

4696.56 --> 4699.92
so nobody knows what gravity is they're

4698.48 --> 4702.32
still in the middle of trying to find

4699.92 --> 4705.04
out what gravity is

4702.32 --> 4706.32
i can tell you gravity is a mathematical

4705.04 --> 4708.56
necessity

4706.32 --> 4710.5599999999995
for an utterly disproven and flawed

4708.56 --> 4712.64
model that's why it's there

4710.56 --> 4713.84
and everything that came forth from it

4712.64 --> 4717.679
as a concept

4713.84 --> 4719.6
because of its giant glaring errors

4717.679 --> 4721.4400000000005
in general right when it was first

4719.6 --> 4723.360000000001
assumed to be a force and then dark

4721.44 --> 4726.4
matter

4723.36 --> 4727.12
and all that dark energy yeah yeah did

4726.4 --> 4730.4
you know

4727.12 --> 4731.04
dark matter and dark energy yeah did you

4730.4 --> 4734.08
know

4731.04 --> 4738.08
that that is still based on the freaking

4734.08 --> 4741.679
model assumption that gravity is a force

4738.08 --> 4744.64
do you get it and it's not

4741.679 --> 4745.92
the entire freaking cosmology is a mess

4744.64 --> 4749.04
it's a giant

4745.92 --> 4752.56
[ __ ] pile the whole thing

4749.04 --> 4756.08
is a giant [ __ ] pile doesn't make

4752.56 --> 4757.84
any sense all of it is built on previous

4756.08 --> 4763.84
assumptions that don't even work

4757.84 --> 4763.84
anymore it's so stupid

4785.84 --> 4793.4400000000005
yep sleeping warrior agreed

4790.239 --> 4795.44
right yeah the black holes

4793.44 --> 4797.199
the assumption that gravity is a force

4795.44 --> 4800.48
and that it can compact

4797.199 --> 4803.36
itself and then reach a critical mass

4800.48 --> 4805.839999999999
literally critical mass right mass the

4803.36 --> 4809.5199999999995
thing that's supposed to be

4805.84 --> 4810.88
influenced by a force that previously

4809.52 --> 4812.0
was known as gravity

4810.88 --> 4814.8
even though nobody claimed the

4812.0 --> 4817.36
hypothesis for it yeah black holes

4814.8 --> 4818.04
dark matter dark energy it's all based

4817.36 --> 4823.12
on that

4818.04 --> 4827.199
previously assumed to be a force gravity

4823.12 --> 4827.199
oh it doesn't work anymore ah

4829.6 --> 4833.84
yeah dark matter is built on the

4831.52 --> 4835.6
assumption that gravity is a force

4833.84 --> 4837.6
it doesn't sound right but it is

4835.6 --> 4840.159000000001
technically correct though

4837.6 --> 4840.639
oh that's a little difficult isn't it

4840.159 --> 4845.4
yes

4840.639 --> 4849.1990000000005
it's you know that's called consistency

4845.4 --> 4852.32
heliocentrism right and astronomy

4849.199 --> 4855.44
and astrophysics they don't have any

4852.32 --> 4859.199
they don't have any consistency

4855.44 --> 4861.28
it's all old storytelling material

4859.199 --> 4863.599999999999
that's not even recognized anymore and

4861.28 --> 4865.12
it's still used as a foundation for the

4863.6 --> 4867.120000000001
entire thing even though it doesn't even

4865.12 --> 4870.48
get a recognition anymore

4867.12 --> 4873.04
yeah how stupid is that

4870.48 --> 4874.879999999999
you still believe it because somebody

4873.04 --> 4877.28
wrote a story about it and you got some

4874.88 --> 4880.32
nice cgi now he's oh you believe it

4877.28 --> 4882.719
you're a dumbass if you believe it

4880.32 --> 4884.719
doesn't work anymore the entire thing is

4882.719 --> 4887.44
all gone to [ __ ]

4884.719 --> 4888.08
and they're still shoveling it out and

4887.44 --> 4890.32
people are

4888.08 --> 4892.32
still eating it up thinking that it's

4890.32 --> 4903.84
actually real

4892.32 --> 4903.84
really freaking dumb

4922.88 --> 4927.36
right yeah black holes they claim that

4925.199 --> 4930.5599999999995
it basically

4927.36 --> 4933.759999999999
the mass still is there but the space

4930.56 --> 4935.84
starts to compact so there's more mass

4933.76 --> 4937.76
in the same space

4935.84 --> 4939.679
and then it compresses and then they're

4937.76 --> 4942.0
supposed to comes out some kind of

4939.679 --> 4943.679
singularity where there is only mass and

4942.0 --> 4947.04
no volume

4943.679 --> 4950.32
which is a mathematical concept

4947.04 --> 4953.04
like there is no way

4950.32 --> 4955.84
that even theoretically something like

4953.04 --> 4958.719
that could actually work

4955.84 --> 4959.84
doesn't make any sense if there's no

4958.719 --> 4963.76
mass

4959.84 --> 4966.4800000000005
then how could it still do anything

4963.76 --> 4967.92
like where is the mass isn't the mass a

4966.48 --> 4970.959999999999
detraction

4967.92 --> 4972.96
from volumetrics like you have the

4970.96 --> 4975.52
volume it has a mass

4972.96 --> 4977.52
you know that because you derived it

4975.52 --> 4979.6
from the matter if there's no more

4977.52 --> 4982.0
volume where are you going to derive the

4979.6 --> 4984.8
mass from it makes no freaking sense

4982.0 --> 4984.8
none of it does

4985.679 --> 5001.84
here comes the plane

5012.08 --> 5015.5199999999995
yeah that's correct foul and buchanan

5013.679 --> 5029.84
it's part of the animation

5015.52 --> 5029.84
pretty funny right

5033.6 --> 5037.120000000001
if you don't have ma a mass try with

5036.4 --> 5040.0
most

5037.12 --> 5041.76
what thanks unit talks famous for the 5

5040.0 --> 5042.96
pound super chat donation i appreciate

5041.76 --> 5045.04
that

5042.96 --> 5048.56
i hope you enjoyed the new format for

5045.04 --> 5048.56
the the new layout for the show

5049.36 --> 5057.839999999999
thanks to adam meekin by the way he put

5052.08 --> 5057.84
it all together

5063.6 --> 5067.120000000001
and yeah sleeping worry i i haven't

5066.159 --> 5069.36
really watched

5067.12 --> 5071.36
zack's latest video was there supposed

5069.36 --> 5074.48
to demonstration

5071.36 --> 5075.599999999999
this display it's like i don't want to

5074.48 --> 5078.879999999999
watch it anymore

5075.6 --> 5081.280000000001
i it's because it's so pointless all of

5078.88 --> 5083.6
it's so pointless i tried to explain

5081.28 --> 5086.639
even like three or four years ago like

5083.6 --> 5090.400000000001
no it can't it's

5086.639 --> 5093.4400000000005
it's the polar opposite in every

5090.4 --> 5096.5599999999995
theory in every conceptual part of it

5093.44 --> 5099.28
electrostatics or dielectric whatever

5096.56 --> 5100.080000000001
[ __ ] electrics something actually

5099.28 --> 5103.599999999999
palpable

5100.08 --> 5106.8
yeah oh gravity not palpable oh

5103.6 --> 5107.360000000001
gravity acting over a fast distance

5106.8 --> 5110.08
right

5107.36 --> 5111.599999999999
electrostatics electrics no not acting

5110.08 --> 5113.679
over a fast distance

5111.6 --> 5114.96
oh electrics magnetics all this

5113.679 --> 5118.8
measurable

5114.96 --> 5121.679
gravity not measurable only derivable

5118.8 --> 5123.12
through mathematics yeah yeah yeah

5121.679 --> 5126.4800000000005
everything about it

5123.12 --> 5130.08
is absolutely wrong in every way

5126.48 --> 5133.12
in every way it's so stupid it's so

5130.08 --> 5135.92
dumb to assume

5133.12 --> 5136.8
this thing that they call incoherent

5135.92 --> 5140.639
dielectric

5136.8 --> 5143.28
whatever it's so dumb

5140.639 --> 5143.76
and not dumb as a thought experiment

5143.28 --> 5146.48
right

5143.76 --> 5147.84
like hey how could you create a sort of

5146.48 --> 5150.239
that could sort of

5147.84 --> 5151.679
explain why the directions of relative

5150.239 --> 5153.599999999999
density and all that yeah yeah

5151.679 --> 5154.719
as a mind experiment no i i would

5153.6 --> 5157.84
appreciate that

5154.719 --> 5160.4
it's just that they really dumb

5157.84 --> 5161.12
in a dumb way reified into reality and

5160.4 --> 5165.92
even commit

5161.12 --> 5168.239
fraud they commit fraud

5165.92 --> 5170.0
by saying things that are blatantly

5168.239 --> 5175.44
wrong

5170.0 --> 5178.56
like oh oh air gases are susceptible

5175.44 --> 5178.96
to a force from magnetism or whatever

5178.56 --> 5183.360000000001
this

5178.96 --> 5186.719
is just wrong doesn't work

5183.36 --> 5189.839999999999
they literally committed fraud

5186.719 --> 5195.28
in their attempt to reify

5189.84 --> 5197.84
a mind experiment into physical reality

5195.28 --> 5199.12
yeah i'm not gonna take that lightly i'm

5197.84 --> 5201.4400000000005
not

5199.12 --> 5203.12
yeah all those people all latching onto

5201.44 --> 5204.799999999999
that yeah yeah yeah you literally

5203.12 --> 5206.159
shut yourself in the foot and you're

5204.8 --> 5208.719
just too arrogant

5206.159 --> 5211.28
to admit it what you think you're gonna

5208.719 --> 5214.88
nasa your way through with the lies

5211.28 --> 5218.159
carrying your lies around

5214.88 --> 5221.4400000000005
like garbage bags like that no no

5218.159 --> 5222.08
it's fraud i don't i don't accept that

5221.44 --> 5225.36
[ __ ]

5222.08 --> 5226.639
yeah i have no respect for these people

5225.36 --> 5229.199
anymore

5226.639 --> 5230.32
you know if they just kept it but look

5229.199 --> 5232.48
if you

5230.32 --> 5234.719
theoretically put something together

5232.48 --> 5236.4
then maybe it would kind of be like yeah

5234.719 --> 5238.32
that's fine that's pretty cool dude i

5236.4 --> 5241.679
totally get that that's cool

5238.32 --> 5244.719
it's just when you try to commit fraud

5241.679 --> 5247.92
to try and change reality to

5244.719 --> 5251.12
kind of reified into the real world

5247.92 --> 5252.4
that's just too far it's not funny

5251.12 --> 5253.599999999999
anyway it's not an

5252.4 --> 5255.44
thought experiment anymore it's

5253.6 --> 5258.4800000000005
literally fraud

5255.44 --> 5261.5199999999995
i don't accept that i'm not gonna be

5258.48 --> 5267.839999999999
buddy buddy hand ruby with you

5261.52 --> 5267.84
in that yeah

5277.36 --> 5281.839999999999
right be back in two minutes

5359.679 --> 5361.92
yo

5363.12 --> 5365.84
um

5380.159 --> 5386.159
ah father of a stone shell i like that i

5383.92 --> 5387.28
flipped a magnet and it shot into the

5386.159 --> 5389.44
sky

5387.28 --> 5391.199
dielectric acceleration proven that's

5389.44 --> 5394.799999999999
hilarious bro

5391.199 --> 5394.799999999999
that is that is really funny

5395.92 --> 5399.76
although it would yeah inclined to just

5398.0 --> 5401.6
flip around though

5399.76 --> 5404.0
that's the first thing it's gonna do now

5401.6 --> 5405.92
maybe if you would stick it into a very

5404.0 --> 5409.44
very long tube

5405.92 --> 5411.6
then maybe it if dielectric

5409.44 --> 5413.28
that whole thing was real and it's not

5411.6 --> 5416.4800000000005
then it would rather be stuck

5413.28 --> 5417.5199999999995
in its in its orientation magnetically

5416.48 --> 5421.199
and then

5417.52 --> 5426.719
in the tube shoot up right

5421.199 --> 5430.08
yeah do uh the tinker a little on your

5426.719 --> 5432.08
on your joke there maybe i ruined the

5430.08 --> 5435.84
joke now but anyway it was funny thanks

5432.08 --> 5435.84
for that

5438.88 --> 5446.159000000001
oh yeah you pay money win

5442.159 --> 5448.32
oh yes so special why don't you do it

5446.159 --> 5449.599999999999
i just stopped whining the freaking flat

5448.32 --> 5452.5599999999995
earthers are about oh

5449.6 --> 5454.56
just do this just go into space and

5452.56 --> 5458.639
prove it yourself

5454.56 --> 5461.04
why don't you [ __ ] do it dumbass

5458.639 --> 5462.08
yeah why do we have to do that to

5461.04 --> 5465.12
reinforce your

5462.08 --> 5467.199
stupid beliefs yeah

5465.12 --> 5468.96
it's not our beliefs it's not our claim

5467.199 --> 5472.32
we simply point out

5468.96 --> 5473.199
how it mechanically can't work that is

5472.32 --> 5476.08
it that's all

5473.199 --> 5476.5599999999995
we need oh you want to proof your outer

5476.08 --> 5480.0
space

5476.56 --> 5480.639
and your zero g environment and all that

5480.0 --> 5483.76
[ __ ]

5480.639 --> 5486.719
you go do it yeah you go do it

5483.76 --> 5487.679
it's your freaking claim of your belief

5486.719 --> 5491.84
get it

5487.679 --> 5491.84
you do it

5514.08 --> 5519.84
i'll help you always

5520.639 --> 5525.6
no no it's not gonna help anybody it's

5523.199 --> 5529.5199999999995
gonna cost me a whole lot of hassle

5525.6 --> 5530.320000000001
money and i'm gonna end up being

5529.52 --> 5531.52
cancelled

5530.32 --> 5534.88
because of course they're not gonna

5531.52 --> 5536.4800000000005
allow me unless i vow or sign some

5534.88 --> 5540.32
stupid little contract

5536.48 --> 5543.04
then i'm gonna go along with the act

5540.32 --> 5544.32
of that it's really in space and [ __ ]

5543.04 --> 5547.76
right

5544.32 --> 5548.32
not gonna do that right i'm also not

5547.76 --> 5551.92
gonna be

5548.32 --> 5554.239
fooled into going high altitude

5551.92 --> 5556.0
and say oh we're in space we're in space

5554.239 --> 5557.04
oh yeah because you're slightly diving

5556.0 --> 5558.639
oh

5557.04 --> 5561.5199999999995
yeah that's not freaking space that's

5558.639 --> 5563.4400000000005
not jrg yeah it's very close i know it's

5561.52 --> 5565.92
fair it's close enough oh it's close uh

5563.44 --> 5566.799999999999
yeah that's what they do then yeah yeah

5565.92 --> 5570.4800000000005
no

5566.8 --> 5573.6
i'm not gonna go along with that [ __ ]

5570.48 --> 5577.599999999999
you're not gonna convince me

5573.6 --> 5580.08
an impossible reality is real

5577.6 --> 5581.360000000001
yeah i'm not that gullible i don't have

5580.08 --> 5585.5199999999995
the need

5581.36 --> 5588.08
to reinforce conditioning about it

5585.52 --> 5590.400000000001
if you want to do that you could do that

5588.08 --> 5590.4
yeah

5592.0 --> 5596.08
trip around the moon and back oh sure

5597.28 --> 5603.599999999999
sure it is and i'll bet

5601.199 --> 5604.5599999999995
that if it's actually around supposedly

5603.6 --> 5606.88
the moon

5604.56 --> 5608.719
it's it's still going to stay visually

5606.88 --> 5609.4400000000005
like very far away isn't it it's not

5608.719 --> 5611.28
going to

5609.44 --> 5613.36
you're not going to angularly approach

5611.28 --> 5615.12
it so that just shows the moon is that

5613.36 --> 5617.28
oh look now it's over there oh we're

5615.12 --> 5620.32
going around the moon oh

5617.28 --> 5621.92
yeah no

5620.32 --> 5624.159
they're not just gonna bring out just

5621.92 --> 5628.32
complete

5624.159 --> 5630.5599999999995
a cgi emulation with screens

5628.32 --> 5632.08
on there i don't know i could conceive

5630.56 --> 5633.84
how to fake this [ __ ]

5632.08 --> 5635.6
i've thought about this stuff like even

5633.84 --> 5639.1990000000005
20 years ago it's just that

5635.6 --> 5641.84
i don't want to hand them more tools to

5639.199 --> 5645.839999999999
brainwash people with they're just gonna

5641.84 --> 5645.84
have to figure that one out themselves

5651.12 --> 5657.12
ten tens of millions of kids oh yeah

5655.199 --> 5658.4
that makes it worth it all i have to do

5657.12 --> 5660.239
is lie

5658.4 --> 5661.44
act like i'm an astronaut and then i'm

5660.239 --> 5664.48
gonna end up

5661.44 --> 5666.159
very very happy like the original

5664.48 --> 5667.839999999999
astronauts because they're like the

5666.159 --> 5670.96
happiest people

5667.84 --> 5674.0
out there right that's a great life

5670.96 --> 5674.0
choice oh

5681.679 --> 5686.8
dude seriously

5684.719 --> 5689.04
if you want range to that kind of money

5686.8 --> 5690.0
you literally have to enslave yourself

5689.04 --> 5692.32
to satan one

5690.0 --> 5693.28
way or another if i wanted that i would

5692.32 --> 5696.32
have done that

5693.28 --> 5700.32
freaking 25 years ago

5696.32 --> 5704.32
yeah i would have i'm not

5700.32 --> 5707.5199999999995
i'm not because i like my soul

5704.32 --> 5710.08
i really do i like my spirit i like

5707.52 --> 5711.280000000001
spiritual freedom i like not being

5710.08 --> 5713.76
burdened

5711.28 --> 5715.92
by being reminded every single day that

5713.76 --> 5719.52
i'm a [ __ ] scumbag

5715.92 --> 5722.32
because i got paid to lie

5719.52 --> 5724.8
permanently i have to lie the rest of my

5722.32 --> 5727.28
life i can never be truthful

5724.8 --> 5728.0
again about that and then i have to

5727.28 --> 5731.36
cover up

5728.0 --> 5733.119
any interest i have about cosmogeny

5731.36 --> 5734.639
everything surrounding that because it

5733.119 --> 5737.36
might threaten

5734.639 --> 5739.52
the signed contract that i have to lie

5737.36 --> 5741.119
about the thing that i did yeah

5739.52 --> 5742.56
i got something better to do with my

5741.119 --> 5744.239
life

5742.56 --> 5746.080000000001
i don't give a [ __ ] if i'm gonna get a

5744.239 --> 5749.119
billion dollars for it i don't

5746.08 --> 5757.84
give a [ __ ] i don't want

5749.119 --> 5757.839999999999
your satan money okay

5768.84 --> 5771.84
uh

5774.639 --> 5785.84
clutch bar i didn't even know that that

5776.56 --> 5785.84
doesn't surprise me at all

5805.04 --> 5808.32
they would say roof insane hobbits look

5807.199 --> 5811.5199999999995
i can't

5808.32 --> 5814.639
i there's no way i could ever

5811.52 --> 5817.84
do anything like that it's to me

5814.639 --> 5821.1990000000005
it's not about getting in rich of those

5817.84 --> 5824.4800000000005
large numbers of money

5821.199 --> 5826.638999999999
right because if i've gone for that i'd

5824.48 --> 5829.28
be freaking competing with bill gates

5826.639 --> 5829.28
now okay

5832.56 --> 5839.84
if i had done that i would [ __ ]

5836.0 --> 5842.56
up the world so bad

5839.84 --> 5843.360000000001
if i had gone for that i'd be the i

5842.56 --> 5845.92
would be

5843.36 --> 5848.159
the number one freaking nightmare of

5845.92 --> 5850.8
people

5848.159 --> 5852.239
and not just bothered not just the

5850.8 --> 5856.56
bothers

5852.239 --> 5856.5599999999995
yeah so no thanks

5861.679 --> 5867.04
just be very very freaking happy i

5864.32 --> 5870.239
didn't do that

5867.04 --> 5871.84
because now you have an arwyn the way

5870.239 --> 5875.119
that he is

5871.84 --> 5877.76
and not a really really

5875.119 --> 5880.32
nasty [ __ ] scumbag that is obsessed

5877.76 --> 5883.119000000001
with eugenics and trying to mind control

5880.32 --> 5884.96
people into killing themselves yeah

5883.119 --> 5887.679
because that's where you go that's where

5884.96 --> 5892.08
you go when you take that ticket huh

5887.679 --> 5892.08
you're not gonna go there not

5892.88 --> 5896.08
there's already enough of that out there

5894.96 --> 5898.88
yeah and these people

5896.08 --> 5901.6
are the worst they are walking

5898.88 --> 5901.6
nightmares

5905.199 --> 5908.839999999999
all of them are gonna end up killing

5906.96 --> 5913.84
themselves to try and

5908.84 --> 5915.360000000001
avoid public humiliation and execution

5913.84 --> 5918.32
all of them they're all gonna kill

5915.36 --> 5921.04
themselves you understand

5918.32 --> 5922.48
all those really [ __ ] nasty people

5921.04 --> 5925.92
they're all going to end up

5922.48 --> 5928.959999999999
killing themselves to prevent

5925.92 --> 5932.32
public humiliation and

5928.96 --> 5935.36
execution do you understand i don't want

5932.32 --> 5935.36
to be part of that group

5936.48 --> 5953.839999999999
is that is that unreasonable

5939.6 --> 5953.84
for me to say that

5962.8 --> 5971.1990000000005
check it out he hung lemon on the craft

5967.36 --> 5973.199
what i didn't know that clutch bear

5971.199 --> 5977.36
that's funny

5973.199 --> 5977.678999999999
weird right but that's what happens when

5977.36 --> 5980.32
you

5977.679 --> 5981.28
take the ticket and then try to expose

5980.32 --> 5983.44
it right

5981.28 --> 5985.119
that's what happens you can't do that

5983.44 --> 5987.839999999999
once you engage

5985.119 --> 5988.4
you're lost forever if you try to crawl

5987.84 --> 5991.84
back

5988.4 --> 5992.32
you die yeah that's how it works you

5991.84 --> 5996.639
can't

5992.32 --> 5996.639
get in and then get out

5997.44 --> 6004.159
trying to basically infiltrate it

6000.96 --> 6007.28
and then break it apart you'll just die

6004.159 --> 6009.759999999999
they don't give a [ __ ] if you take the

6007.28 --> 6022.08
ticket and you betray them you die

6009.76 --> 6026.719
you get it

6022.08 --> 6026.719
you are you are where's wally

6028.159 --> 6031.92
yeah and hey the ticket right this is

6031.36 --> 6034.5599999999995
not

6031.92 --> 6036.0
believing the ball ticket okay that's

6034.56 --> 6040.04
not the ticket i'm talking about

6036.0 --> 6042.96
i'm talking about real satanic [ __ ]

6040.04 --> 6045.44
multi-billionaires that are literally

6042.96 --> 6046.4800000000005
social engineering the world into trying

6045.44 --> 6050.159
to make everybody

6046.48 --> 6053.28
kill themselves for every conceivable

6050.159 --> 6056.799999999999
reason they could get together yeah

6053.28 --> 6060.239
that's ticket i'm pretty sure

6056.8 --> 6063.92
where's wally [ __ ] troll

6060.239 --> 6067.28
idiot in chat is not taking that ticket

6063.92 --> 6070.4
because then he wouldn't be doing this

6067.28 --> 6072.0
unless he's already realized it's too

6070.4 --> 6073.04
late and he might be somebody really

6072.0 --> 6076.4
rich just

6073.04 --> 6080.88
just trying to squirt secretly

6076.4 --> 6080.879999999999
but i doubt it i really really do

6085.119 --> 6088.799999999999
buy the ticket take the ride and then

6087.44 --> 6093.839999999999
die yeah

6088.8 --> 6093.84

6127.76 --> 6131.4400000000005
adam meekin

6128.639 --> 6132.400000000001
who put it together scraped all of this

6131.44 --> 6135.36
off the internet

6132.4 --> 6137.44
somehow i don't know how he does it i

6135.36 --> 6140.32
don't know where he finds it but he does

6137.44 --> 6142.08
and it's pretty awesome so thank you

6140.32 --> 6142.639
again adam meekin for the amazing new

6142.08 --> 6149.84
layout

6142.639 --> 6149.84
i really appreciate all that work

6157.44 --> 6162.48
also by the way to whoever originally

6160.32 --> 6164.639
designed it

6162.48 --> 6165.678999999999
thanks to them as well i don't know who

6164.639 --> 6168.0
they are though

6165.679 --> 6169.52
because hey adam plucked it off the

6168.0 --> 6171.92
internet

6169.52 --> 6174.080000000001
but i don't know literally who made it

6171.92 --> 6177.52
like who made that animation of the

6174.08 --> 6180.8
background i don't know

6177.52 --> 6191.84
you did a damn good job sir or lady

6180.8 --> 6191.84

6249.119 --> 6252.5599999999995
the arch which is really beautiful it's

6250.96 --> 6253.679
almost a waste that you can't see it

6252.56 --> 6254.159000000001
because it's just such a great

6253.679 --> 6261.84
background

6254.159 --> 6261.839999999999
anyway here's it

up there in detail pretty awesome right

6342.84 --> 6345.84

6350.8 --> 6354.719
paintings yeah but this one's animated

6352.88 --> 6357.4400000000005
though

6354.719 --> 6358.2390000000005
and it's constantly changing as you can

6357.44 --> 6361.36
damn well see

right now the new look is awesome i'm

6361.36 --> 6366.639
glad you enjoyed it aaron brown

6364.48 --> 6369.119
so earlier in chat there was a lot of

6366.639 --> 6373.84
trolls

6369.119 --> 6373.839999999999
that that has passed now

6379.199 --> 6382.48
let me show you the other background

6382.0 --> 6384.32
again

6382.48 --> 6387.839999999999
i've not used it really even when i was

6384.32 --> 6387.84
ranting i just forgot

6388.08 --> 6392.32
but there's another one as well and

6390.32 --> 6396.639
there it is

6392.32 --> 6400.639
boom right i'm angry

6396.639 --> 6402.88
damn you this is

6400.639 --> 6404.2390000000005
this is basically the uh the globe

6402.88 --> 6407.119
coming to an end

6404.239 --> 6415.839999999999
and gravity getting all weird with

6407.119 --> 6415.839999999999
floaty rocks up there and [ __ ]

6418.08 --> 6429.84
yeah do give me a thumbs up that would

6420.32 --> 6429.84
be cool

6440.84 --> 6443.84
wow

6444.8 --> 6448.159000000001
what are you talking about george

6454.84 --> 6458.719
sanford yeah let me uh

6461.84 --> 6471.84
this is behind it boom

6465.44 --> 6471.839999999999
i just got out of the way just in time

6478.56 --> 6480.88
yep

6481.84 --> 6485.84
all right so let's see the other view

6497.44 --> 6501.599999999999
our winds end times background yeah

6501.679 --> 6513.84
you could call it that

6517.44 --> 6521.04
i've i've even got more backgrounds but

6520.08 --> 6524.5599999999995
we just put

6521.04 --> 6527.04
in these two there's other things

6524.56 --> 6528.159000000001
out there as well like adam got a whole

6527.04 --> 6532.0
range of

6528.159 --> 6532.0
like background video backgrounds

6532.159 --> 6541.839999999999
i found a whole bunch of them

6545.28 --> 6548.639
all right so i'm gonna run out the show

6547.36 --> 6551.04
soon i think

6548.639 --> 6554.88
i wanna run out a little early because i

6551.04 --> 6556.56
wanna do lunch

6554.88 --> 6558.0
before the flat earth debate i don't

6556.56 --> 6559.04
have to go out for groceries so i'm

6558.0 --> 6562.8
gonna try to be

6559.04 --> 6563.44
on the show active as much as possible

6562.8 --> 6565.28
basically

6563.44 --> 6566.5599999999995
elbowing the rest out of the way that

6565.28 --> 6568.639
are also gonna try to

6566.56 --> 6569.599
of course do that as they always do on

6568.639 --> 6573.84
the monday

6569.599 --> 6573.84
it's very rare that it's not like that

6574.56 --> 6586.080000000001
all right so yeah don't

6582.8 --> 6588.400000000001
don't forget to uh rogan's the show up

6586.08 --> 6590.32
i'll i'll round out with that as well

6588.4 --> 6593.839999999999
but

6590.32 --> 6597.84
it would be cool if you if all of you

6593.84 --> 6597.84
would give it a thumbs up

6598.32 --> 6603.759999999999
to offset all grim vs and simon dance

6601.199 --> 6603.759999999999
trolls

6604.239 --> 6607.44
because yeah oh man this is this is

6606.4 --> 6609.759999999999
better looking

6607.44 --> 6611.44
so immediately more down votes right

6609.76 --> 6613.84
that makes so much sense

6611.44 --> 6615.5199999999995
that's perfectly logical whenever that

6613.84 --> 6618.08
happens on the internet

6615.52 --> 6618.56
somebody improves their look that's what

6618.08 --> 6620.639
you get

6618.56 --> 6624.159000000001
more that's when you get more down votes

6620.639 --> 6627.04
that's absolutely logical it's not

6624.159 --> 6628.799999999999
it's not manipulative or manipulated at

6627.04 --> 6631.76
all

6628.8 --> 6631.76
totally real

6633.44 --> 6641.04
ha hashtag mifa indeed amanda young

6638.56 --> 6641.04
rob h

6647.119 --> 6654.88
just like your green tea tree

6650.159 --> 6656.719
in the spheres

6654.88 --> 6667.84
much truth there what i don't know what

6656.719 --> 6667.84

6669.199 --> 6674.5599999999995
okay thanks logan's run i appreciate

6671.28 --> 6676.5599999999995
that i'm just double checking

6674.56 --> 6679.1990000000005
because there yeah my votes have been

6676.56 --> 6680.080000000001
like that for a long time like a lot

6679.199 --> 6683.04
like almost the

6680.08 --> 6684.0
entire early bird series the entire

6683.04 --> 6688.239
thing

6684.0 --> 6691.44
it's been this it's like either

6688.239 --> 6694.5599999999995
even votes or down are

6691.44 --> 6695.119
at least twice as much that's been how

6694.56 --> 6697.679
it's

6695.119 --> 6699.04
like happened in the like during the

6697.679 --> 6702.08
entire

6699.04 --> 6704.4
show in the last what is it now three

6702.08 --> 6704.4
years

6706.0 --> 6709.84
hey adamikin

6716.08 --> 6722.48
all right but in the end you know

6719.28 --> 6726.239
this youtube it's really my channel what

6722.48 --> 6726.239
i do it's really for you guys

6727.04 --> 6732.56
it really is because youtube

6730.08 --> 6734.84
i do i think youtube just wish i would

6732.56 --> 6737.679
go away

6734.84 --> 6738.159000000001
really it's kind of letting me do this

6737.679 --> 6740.08
but it

6738.159 --> 6741.759999999999
it really wants me to just go away

6740.08 --> 6745.199
because otherwise it wouldn't be

6741.76 --> 6745.1990000000005
so rigged like this

6746.719 --> 6752.0
so they definitely don't want to get get

6749.28 --> 6755.28
me more attention i don't know why

6752.0 --> 6759.04
whether i'm a threat in some form

6755.28 --> 6762.239
or they just really don't like my

6759.04 --> 6764.639
inflexible rigid attitude towards their

6762.239 --> 6767.28
propaganda attitude

6764.639 --> 6767.28
could be that

6768.639 --> 6772.719
or just that i'm i'm dangerous i might

6771.76 --> 6776.159000000001
be dangerous

6772.719 --> 6779.119
because i just really don't

6776.159 --> 6779.598999999999
[ __ ] around i really don't lie and i

6779.119 --> 6782.639
don't

6779.599 --> 6783.360000000001
try to manipulate people with crazy

6782.639 --> 6787.04
stories

6783.36 --> 6789.839999999999
and telling them untruth as truth

6787.04 --> 6791.119
i've like never done that like never

6789.84 --> 6792.56
that's something you can only

6791.119 --> 6796.4
consciously do and i've

6792.56 --> 6796.400000000001
never done that ever

6798.8 --> 6802.159000000001
and that's just a threat to them it's

6800.639 --> 6805.679
like somebody that's just

6802.159 --> 6809.04
totally honest always

6805.679 --> 6811.52
that's a threat they don't want that

6809.04 --> 6812.96
they don't want anybody to be personally

6811.52 --> 6815.599
visible

6812.96 --> 6817.119
and then not resort to lying about

6815.599 --> 6819.1990000000005
themselves i think that's the biggest

6817.119 --> 6822.239
threat i think the biggest threat

6819.199 --> 6822.879999999999
is that i'm publicly not lying about

6822.239 --> 6824.879999999999
myself

6822.88 --> 6826.4800000000005
i'm perfectly honest that's kind of

6824.88 --> 6829.4400000000005
unique in this world now

6826.48 --> 6831.04
because it's just normalized that people

6829.44 --> 6834.5599999999995
lie about themselves

6831.04 --> 6836.159
all the time so that's a threat

6834.56 --> 6838.0
so maybe it's just that maybe it's not

6836.159 --> 6840.159
even the flat earth thing

6838.0 --> 6849.52
it's just that i'm a threat because i

6840.159 --> 6852.96
just refuse to ever lie about myself

6849.52 --> 6852.96
hey julio pabin thanks

6854.239 --> 6863.839999999999

6866.4 --> 6877.839999999999
with it thanks adam

6879.199 --> 6884.48
ever played coriolis golf what

6886.0 --> 6890.48
that's hilarious logan's run but i'm

6889.199 --> 6892.5599999999995
pretty sure that any

6890.48 --> 6895.919999999999
presumed to be coriolis deviation is

6892.56 --> 6900.4800000000005
simply going to be wind deviation

6895.92 --> 6900.4800000000005

6900.8 --> 6904.0
