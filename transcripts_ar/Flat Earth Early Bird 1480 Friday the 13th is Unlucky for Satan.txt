it's not gonna change anyway the weather

119.7 --> 124.68
today is different

121.439 --> 128.099
yesterday was terrible weather

124.68 --> 131.94
it was just storms

128.099 --> 133.92
and like rain and it it did not end I

131.94 --> 134.76
mean I didn't go out for groceries at

133.92 --> 137.94
all

134.76 --> 140.51999999999998
so today I have minty

137.94 --> 143.04
but today

140.52 --> 144.78
yeah it's it's there's a lot of wind

143.04 --> 147.66
blowing out there

144.78 --> 151.58
but there isn't any rain right now so I

147.66 --> 151.57999999999998
will actually go out for groceries some

152.28 --> 158.52
some hours from now

155.28 --> 161.78
hopefully it still won't be raining

158.52 --> 161.78
but yeah it's

161.819 --> 164.78
a bit Restless

166.62 --> 172.09900000000002
but I feel

168.42 --> 172.099
really good actually

174.71 --> 179.28
[Music]

176.819 --> 183.61999999999998
hey hello seeking star water first in

179.28 --> 183.62
chat LSG good to see you

186.86 --> 192.65900000000002
last couple yeah yeah seeking star

189.66 --> 195.659
whatever yeah I heard yesterday uh is it

192.659 --> 198.239
skeptic936

195.659 --> 199.92
told me in chat that it was indeed just

198.239 --> 201.72
a glitch

199.92 --> 204.05999999999997
right

201.72 --> 206.78
anyway

204.06 --> 206.78
ah

212.819 --> 216.04
man the wind is blowing like right

215.28 --> 219.36
through the house

216.04 --> 221.22
[Music]

219.36 --> 223.68
so if I'm gonna go out there on my bike

221.22 --> 226.98
it's going to be like risky because I

223.68 --> 228.18
might get like blown off my bike

226.98 --> 229.5
oh well

228.18 --> 231.42000000000002
[Music]

229.5 --> 234.659
as long as it's not

231.42 --> 238.04
like Frozen and super windy then it's

234.659 --> 238.04
still doable uh

240.959 --> 245.22
right so yeah how are you guys doing I'm

243.239 --> 247.379
doing actually pretty good

245.22 --> 251.35999999999999
it's weird

247.379 --> 251.35999999999999
I didn't drink any beers yesterday

251.819 --> 256.62
and well I ran out of green tea and

254.819 --> 258.359
continued on with mint tea which was

256.62 --> 260.639
kind of like man

258.359 --> 262.079
but now

260.639 --> 267.86
today

262.079 --> 267.86
like my guts feel incredibly restored

268.259 --> 272.40000000000003
it's weird

270.12 --> 274.259
so I'm actually gonna try to keep this

272.4 --> 275.16999999999996
up I don't know how long it's gonna last

274.259 --> 276.8
before I get

275.17 --> 279.97900000000004
[Music]

276.8 --> 279.979
seduced again

280.979 --> 285.3
but

283.199 --> 287.22
yeah

285.3 --> 289.979
I mean I've been drinking beers on a

287.22 --> 293.58000000000004
daily basis for a very long time now I

289.979 --> 296.71999999999997
think like two or three years maybe more

293.58 --> 296.71999999999997
and a lost track

297.419 --> 302.82
and yeah now that I'm not

300.72 --> 305.58000000000004
drinking all of a sudden in a day

302.82 --> 308.09999999999997
without necessarily being super stressed

305.58 --> 309.18
out I just kind of like kept calm and

308.1 --> 311.94
all that

309.18 --> 314.16
I literally noticed as faculties were

311.94 --> 317.04
returning to me

314.16 --> 321.24
just a small percentage

317.04 --> 324.78000000000003
but still it's like oh oh yeah

321.24 --> 327.18
it's just the perspective of drinking or

324.78 --> 328.73999999999995
of like doing that being a drinker for a

327.18 --> 332.66
while

328.74 --> 332.66
it's such a different way

332.94 --> 336.5
of managing yourself

337.86 --> 340.46000000000004
right

341.94 --> 349.259
but uh yeah in in the face of like the

346.32 --> 351.06
well financial situation

349.259 --> 353.46000000000004
I thought it would be a good idea to try

351.06 --> 358.46
to stop drinking for a while just to

353.46 --> 358.46
save some cost and see what happens

361.259 --> 365.85
and also test like how dependent

363.72 --> 367.259
physically have I become on it

365.85 --> 369.72
[Music]

367.259 --> 374.1
well the first sign was definitely like

369.72 --> 376.44000000000005
no but I don't know like the actual drag

374.1 --> 379.22
back may still come

376.44 --> 379.21999999999997
we'll see

379.32 --> 383.039
anyway it's been kind of pleasant

381.6 --> 386.47900000000004
yesterday

383.039 --> 386.479
my show was great I thought

386.759 --> 390.24
even though I didn't really figure out a

388.5 --> 393.12
title but hey

390.24 --> 396.38
it's just not every show necessarily

393.12 --> 396.38
must have a title

397.8 --> 404.34000000000003
flatters debate was also

400.86 --> 406.97900000000004
good enough I did get back on there I

404.34 --> 409.919
did not really say a lot

406.979 --> 413.75899999999996
try to get a joke through

409.919 --> 415.85999999999996
and first got snarling

413.759 --> 419.72
and then the second time I got approval

415.86 --> 419.72
and yeah that's about it

423.06 --> 428.419
and then afterward did also talk a bit

430.74 --> 436.40000000000003
Discord panel afterward

434.1 --> 436.40000000000003
foreign

441.08 --> 448.38
humble h

443.58 --> 452.639
was got back and talked some more

448.38 --> 454.8
but then like uh Die slow

452.639 --> 459.0
and some other guy didn't know started

454.8 --> 462.78000000000003
blabbering on with Ken wheeler

459.0 --> 462.78
electric nonsense

462.9 --> 468.35999999999996
and ether

464.699 --> 471.62
and just like I I didn't want to sit in

468.36 --> 471.62
in that so I just left

472.319 --> 475.40000000000003
unless G was there

475.8 --> 479.18
my chat still alive

484.02 --> 487.62
[Music]

485.819 --> 489.72
yeah

487.62 --> 493.28000000000003
okay

489.72 --> 493.28000000000003
all right 12 watching

497.88 --> 502.4
um

499.74 --> 502.40000000000003
right

502.44 --> 507.18
did not continue watching Taboo

508.199 --> 515.039
just saved it for another day

512.06 --> 517.1999999999999
and why I need to rush through it it's

515.039 --> 520.3389999999999
just like I don't know I wasn't in the

517.2 --> 520.339
in that type of mood yesterday

520.56 --> 524.8389999999999
some other videos instead

525.959 --> 531.66
and also uh yeah I picked up Baldur's

529.14 --> 534.54
Gate again

531.66 --> 536.88
which was absolutely fascinating to

534.54 --> 539.48
experience again

536.88 --> 539.48
I mean

540.54 --> 544.74
I think I've explained it before about

542.58 --> 546.6
that game but that game is literally

544.74 --> 549.6
like

546.6 --> 553.279
a digital interactive book

549.6 --> 556.6800000000001
it really really is

553.279 --> 559.019
a book series

556.68 --> 562.14
and it's very well written

559.019 --> 564.12
and like I've been playing Dragon Spirit

562.14 --> 567.959
which was like the

564.12 --> 569.64
Dragon uh dragon baller skate one and a

567.959 --> 573.38
half effectively and then in between

569.64 --> 573.38
story between the first and the second

573.839 --> 581.339
and it was written with so much care

578.399 --> 583.98
and just

581.339 --> 587.1600000000001
the World building of it all

583.98 --> 589.58
and and and like the voice acting which

587.16 --> 589.5799999999999
is like

589.8 --> 595.56
just done with great care and attention

592.86 --> 597.42
it's just such a freaking high quality

595.56 --> 601.0189999999999
product man

597.42 --> 603.66
and it's like oh Graphics great like it

601.019 --> 605.88
doesn't matter it's not about that

603.66 --> 608.04
like the graphics are effectively

605.88 --> 611.3389999999999
secondary

608.04 --> 615.12
and I really appreciate it because they

611.339 --> 618.12
like it doesn't it helps that it's less

615.12 --> 620.88
dominant while you then spit spend more

618.12 --> 625.2
of your attention span to the music

620.88 --> 627.959
which is pristine all of the followers

625.2 --> 629.519
gate games really are it's made with so

627.959 --> 633.06
much care

629.519 --> 636.3
classical in a in an interesting way

633.06 --> 640.5799999999999
Dynamic way and

636.3 --> 640.5799999999999
yeah and just the narration and all that

641.04 --> 646.529
and reading

643.24 --> 646.529
[Music]

647.82 --> 652.44
it's I really like the games

650.64 --> 654.48
anyway

652.44 --> 657.8000000000001
I'm sorry I was crying I said no

654.48 --> 658.98
drinkies oh okay

657.8 --> 662.3389999999999
[Music]

658.98 --> 666.1800000000001
uh you can have whatever you like I'm

662.339 --> 671.48
just like I don't right now

666.18 --> 671.4799999999999
yesterday and today neither I think

671.82 --> 681.3000000000001
uh

673.0 --> 682.62
[Music]

681.3 --> 685.1099999999999
I don't know what you have to be sad

682.62 --> 688.269
about that I'm not sad about it

685.11 --> 688.269
[Music]

695.22 --> 698.9590000000001
for three weeks hmm

699.839 --> 704.0600000000001
oh wow that's that's a long time

704.279 --> 709.459
all right

705.899 --> 709.459
that's longer than I am

713.519 --> 718.32
right but anyway you don't have to worry

715.44 --> 722.2790000000001
I'm not gonna talk about that

718.32 --> 725.0400000000001
I don't talk about

722.279 --> 727.62
drinking I mean I never really do even

725.04 --> 731.48
though I have I I will admit it

727.62 --> 731.48
but I'm not gonna shove it in your face

731.579 --> 736.8599999999999
I know how difficult it can be for some

733.86 --> 740.899
people out there so

736.86 --> 740.899
hello Supreme knowing good to see you

743.8 --> 750.0
[Music]

747.0 --> 750.0
right

760.83 --> 763.95
[Music]

765.079 --> 771.9799999999999
no I don't I mean I have I had like one

769.2 --> 771.98
and a half liter

772.62 --> 776.18
every day that's it

777.0 --> 782.82
anymore would kind of make me like

779.339 --> 785.7600000000001
palpably sick so

782.82 --> 789.779
I have very real very rare occasion but

785.76 --> 794.22
it's like it's risky more than three

789.779 --> 796.76
half liters but anyway uh

794.22 --> 796.76
foreign

798.26 --> 803.459
it still does influence me I mean it

801.839 --> 806.1
influenced me in a way that it kind of

803.459 --> 808.38
binds me in that moment it does

806.1 --> 810.779
definitely make me

808.38 --> 812.9399999999999
a lot less worried

810.779 --> 815.519
and more jolly

812.94 --> 819.24
naturally but

815.519 --> 820.92
also it kind of like extends my ego

819.24 --> 823.62
sensitivity a bit

820.92 --> 825.7199999999999
especially like well it's like it

823.62 --> 826.86
doesn't take away the ebb and flow of

825.72 --> 828.12
mood

826.86 --> 831.6
right

828.12 --> 834.9590000000001
and when I'm I'm using alcohol I'm more

831.6 --> 838.399
quickly engaging in harder triggered

834.959 --> 838.399
that that's just a fact

840.12 --> 845.1
but that's only during it right because

842.399 --> 848.72
outside of that when it wears off

845.1 --> 848.72
well there's still influences

849.3 --> 852.779
and I'm noticing that now now that I

851.459 --> 855.66
haven't

852.779 --> 857.579
drank I'm just noticing wow like this is

855.66 --> 860.639
a very different

857.579 --> 863.18
way of waking up

860.639 --> 863.1800000000001
anyway

883.459 --> 889.699
right I got another

886.32 --> 889.6990000000001
PayPal small one

890.519 --> 896.88
thank you like thank you for just slowly

893.519 --> 900.5600000000001
keeping it coming I mean it's it's

896.88 --> 900.56
at this point extremely helpful

901.1 --> 908.1
yeah dank support yesterday was

904.44 --> 910.0790000000001
that was a real good one

908.1 --> 912.74

910.079 --> 912.7399999999999
uh

915.24 --> 921.139
cup of coffee you made me sick oh wow

923.04 --> 927.959
bad reaction to Coffee yep I've had

926.399 --> 930.839
those that's why I've stopped drinking

927.959 --> 933.4799999999999
coffee for for I think

930.839 --> 935.8800000000001
more than a year now not sure entirely

933.48 --> 937.74
when I get it well I I should be able to

935.88 --> 941.72
basically backtrack through my shows

937.74 --> 941.72
because I literally tell you

941.88 --> 945.6
but I haven't had coffee for a long time

944.04 --> 948.12
I don't even have it in the house

945.6 --> 949.9200000000001
anymore it's like

948.12 --> 952.32
I just got through it and then I didn't

949.92 --> 956.639
buy again

952.32 --> 960.779
and my coffee machine is gathering dust

956.639 --> 963.5600000000001
Sensei open ah but that's not yeah

960.779 --> 963.56
yuck

967.62 --> 973.32
yeah that's like weaponized coffee

970.92 --> 975.959
I'd feel sick too

973.32 --> 978.36
like even in the time when I was still a

975.959 --> 981.3599999999999
coffee drinker that would make me sick

978.36 --> 981.36
dude

983.699 --> 986.24

986.65 --> 995.519
[Music]

even if you like vacuum sealed

1026.6 --> 1029.62
seeking star water

1037.339 --> 1042.559
I mean it's the the oil going rancid is

1041.0 --> 1045.62
that

1042.559 --> 1048.579
an internal reaction or is that through

1045.62 --> 1048.579
oxidization

1048.919 --> 1051.1000000000001
foreign

1059.2 --> 1063.38
right now but it's good to know that

1061.7 --> 1066.26
about coffee

1063.38 --> 1072.2
thanks for the tip

1066.26 --> 1075.5
[Music]

1072.2 --> 1079.179
right so once it's roasted

1075.5 --> 1079.179
it's basically three months

1081.14 --> 1083.74
foreign

1087.16 --> 1091.42
good to see you again

1090.02 --> 1094.779
hmm

1091.42 --> 1094.779
[Music]

1098.78 --> 1104.12
that's interesting but I wonder if there

1101.299 --> 1105.2
even is like like but how do you roast

1104.12 --> 1107.6599999999999
them then

1105.2 --> 1111.039
do you have like a special

1107.66 --> 1111.039
coffee roast machine

1112.28 --> 1116.36
or you just put it on a sheet of paper

1114.919 --> 1119.679
in the oven

1116.36 --> 1119.6789999999999
how do you do that then

1131.08 --> 1135.039
refrigerator okay

1135.799 --> 1142.76
coffee roaster

1138.32 --> 1142.76
okay special device hmm

1144.64 --> 1149.6000000000001
interesting I never really got to that

1147.38 --> 1151.8200000000002
stage

1149.6 --> 1154.3999999999999
I was just like no I'll just get the

1151.82 --> 1157.6399999999999
organic coffee that tastes really well

1154.4 --> 1159.8200000000002
and they grind it up right there in the

1157.64 --> 1159.8200000000002
store

1160.46 --> 1166.52
and I've always like really enjoyed it

1162.74 --> 1168.44
never really had problems until well

1166.52 --> 1170.4189999999999
the last

1168.44 --> 1174.28
couple of years that I've been drinking

1170.419 --> 1174.2800000000002
because I've been drinking coffee since

1177.679 --> 1183.2
how's that I think I roughly started

1180.86 --> 1184.9399999999998
when I was 17 and then it became like a

1183.2 --> 1186.799
daily habit around

1184.94 --> 1189.6200000000001
21 or something

1186.799 --> 1192.32
so I've been drinking it for a decent

1189.62 --> 1195.02
amount of years

1192.32 --> 1197.559
that's not even that much actually like

1195.02 --> 1197.559
10 years

1201.2 --> 1206.66
all together that wasn't drinking coffee

1203.66 --> 1208.039
when it was with my ex

1206.66 --> 1211.039
no wait

1208.039 --> 1211.039
hmm

1223.76 --> 1228.76
and I always did like the taste of

1226.039 --> 1228.76
coffee a lot

1233.78 --> 1239.66
too much moisture in the fridge

1237.14 --> 1242.919
yeah I just keep it in as a sealed

1239.66 --> 1242.919
aluminum box

1243.44 --> 1249.44
if I have it I don't

1246.14 --> 1253.0590000000002
right now anyway

1249.44 --> 1253.059
hello by the way George Sanford

1253.47 --> 1256.519
[Music]

1260.66 --> 1267.38
man dude

1263.66 --> 1270.799
if I'm gonna feel this well in my guts

1267.38 --> 1272.5390000000002
even during like a stormy day just from

1270.799 --> 1275.24
stopping drinking

1272.539 --> 1277.48
man I stopped drinking just for that

1275.24 --> 1277.48
alone

1277.58 --> 1282.98
because as you all know I've been having

1280.4 --> 1286.72
a lot of discomfort there

1282.98 --> 1286.72
in the last couple of years

1293.12 --> 1296.4799999999998
although it might also have something

1294.74 --> 1298.28
that well with the coffee first and it

1296.48 --> 1301.88
stopped it then and but the green tea

1298.28 --> 1303.1
too it's the it's the actual

1301.88 --> 1305.9
the the

1303.1 --> 1308.84
caffeine from the tea

1305.9 --> 1312.14
I think I might just be

1308.84 --> 1314.3799999999999
coming more caffeine intolerant all

1312.14 --> 1314.38
around

1320.299 --> 1322.96
make sense

1324.61 --> 1328.8799999999999
[Music]

1326.659 --> 1332.179
but yeah mint tea doesn't have that it's

1328.88 --> 1334.46
just an herbal tea and

1332.179 --> 1337.1000000000001
it's just something to drink

1334.46 --> 1340.159
and it's calming

1337.1 --> 1342.799
my guts like this I mean I I drink this

1340.159 --> 1343.5800000000002
typically when I'm like shaking or

1342.799 --> 1347.24
something

1343.58 --> 1349.58
or when I just when I'm sick

1347.24 --> 1350.4
so

1349.58 --> 1353.559
anyway

1350.4 --> 1353.5590000000002
[Music]

1360.44 --> 1365.299
if I seem like more than usually

1362.659 --> 1366.98
distracted it's because just there's a

1365.299 --> 1370.1589999999999
lot of things happening with feelings

1366.98 --> 1373.64
and realizations and I'm like trying to

1370.159 --> 1375.0200000000002
reconfigure the data based on what's

1373.64 --> 1377.679
Happening

1375.02 --> 1377.679
I don't know

1379.24 --> 1385.179
reconfigure the arrangement of the data

1382.159 --> 1385.179
let's just put it like that

1386.24 --> 1391.58
because if you're like in a cycle of

1388.76 --> 1394.94
doing something then you can really only

1391.58 --> 1397.6399999999999
work with what the perspective that

1394.94 --> 1399.559
you get from that cycle but if you then

1397.64 --> 1402.0800000000002
step out then certainly you can like

1399.559 --> 1403.7
view the entire cycle in a completely

1402.08 --> 1408.02
different light

1403.7 --> 1410.98
because now you'll see the difference

1408.02 --> 1414.2
and what basically the difference

1410.98 --> 1417.559
entails and is in like what you can do

1414.2 --> 1420.02
and how it is experienced so I'm this is

1417.559 --> 1422.6
almost like an expert this is the great

1420.02 --> 1424.22
our win stops drinking for a day

1422.6 --> 1428.4399999999998
experiment

1424.22 --> 1428.44
basically that's what it is to me is

1428.9 --> 1436.4
uh

1430.05 --> 1436.3999999999999
[Music]

1445.94 --> 1448.419
right

1450.38 --> 1454.48
I hope you didn't know I'll tune out by

1452.299 --> 1454.48
now

1460.34 --> 1466.48
all right

1462.5 --> 1466.48
catching up on some Owen Benjamin

1469.159 --> 1473.5590000000002
tone of its last show was very

1471.14 --> 1473.5590000000002
interesting

1478.76 --> 1481.6
what else

1515.299 --> 1518.299
foreign

1522.039 --> 1526.8799999999999
sorry I'm getting distracted just

1525.02 --> 1530.299
catching up

1526.88 --> 1532.88
articles here I put visor

1530.299 --> 1534.98
it's an herb worm

1532.88 --> 1537.98
yeah yeah

1534.98 --> 1541.279
that it's a it's a classic Bard set it

1537.98 --> 1544.46
like doing that is classic Bard and it's

1541.279 --> 1547.039
totally done on Benjamin's Lane

1544.46 --> 1549.52
and yeah the text was pretty well

1547.039 --> 1549.52
crafted

1555.86 --> 1560.84
I didn't like particularly like

1558.14 --> 1565.3600000000001
listening to it but I do recognize that

1560.84 --> 1565.36
it is a very finely Crafted song

1570.48 --> 1573.619
[Music]

1575.9 --> 1580.5800000000002
I mean when you listen to that then

1578.6 --> 1583.2199999999998
every time the eye of the tiger comes up

1580.58 --> 1585.799
as a song you will probably like have

1583.22 --> 1587.659
like like a side party in your hearing

1585.799 --> 1590.96
own Vineyard I'll have to fight right

1587.659 --> 1594.38
next to that's very likely to happen

1590.96 --> 1595.82
for a while at least which means it's a

1594.38 --> 1600.7600000000002
a good

1595.82 --> 1600.76
well crafted little trinket

1602.07 --> 1605.77
[Music]

1606.98 --> 1611.059
right but it's not so good that I

1608.9 --> 1613.22
constantly like playing it which I did

1611.059 --> 1616.36
have actually with Jim Bob's song but

1613.22 --> 1616.3600000000001
that's that's personal

1617.36 --> 1624.9189999999999
and I really like the the hyper melodic

1621.02 --> 1627.26
dynamics of that thing that he did

1624.919 --> 1629.659
that I won't eat today so I just really

1627.26 --> 1631.52
like that song it's not gonna stick in

1629.659 --> 1633.6200000000001
most people's heads because they're kind

1631.52 --> 1636.799
of like uh

1633.62 --> 1638.1599999999999
it's creepy or something but to me it's

1636.799 --> 1640.8799999999999
it's different

1638.16 --> 1643.3600000000001
[Music]

1640.88 --> 1643.3600000000001
anyway

1650.179 --> 1654.2
the big difference also is of course

1652.039 --> 1656.96
that you're welcome Benjamin's life to

1654.2 --> 1659.659
fight their song was created after a

1656.96 --> 1662.96
already written song so it was really

1659.659 --> 1665.779
text based uh Jim Bob did exactly the

1662.96 --> 1666.6200000000001
opposite he was just musically [ __ ]

1665.779 --> 1670.34
around

1666.62 --> 1673.6999999999998
and saying some texts that were like in

1670.34 --> 1675.799
a story setting and then afterwards

1673.7 --> 1677.6000000000001
somehow I did probably use some AI or

1675.799 --> 1680.059
something I don't know how he did maybe

1677.6 --> 1681.6789999999999
he had somebody was like really inspired

1680.059 --> 1685.46
and

1681.679 --> 1688.659
and they made the song around it

1685.46 --> 1688.659
totally the opposite

1694.58 --> 1699.559
it's a bit of a shame that that jimbob

1697.64 --> 1702.0800000000002
doesn't play it more often like on this

1699.559 --> 1704.24
show I mean he does it himself but I

1702.08 --> 1706.8999999999999
mean that song is pretty awesome I think

1704.24 --> 1706.9
I don't know

1708.02 --> 1714.34
yeah maybe you don't agree

1711.14 --> 1714.3400000000001
maybe I'm just weird

1722.179 --> 1726.98
I I don't know I just I had some

1724.64 --> 1728.72
personal spiritual sympathy with it

1726.98 --> 1730.58
because I don't know sometimes I

1728.72 --> 1732.1000000000001
struggle with thinking like I'm not

1730.58 --> 1736.039
gonna eat today

1732.1 --> 1737.84
for very little like just enough to get

1736.039 --> 1741.2
by

1737.84 --> 1743.4189999999999
and not get sick from it right and so

1741.2 --> 1745.94
yeah it's not of course as dramatic as

1743.419 --> 1749.179
what happens with those typical

1745.94 --> 1752.3200000000002
impoverished people in Africa

1749.179 --> 1752.3200000000002
but that's not the point

1753.08 --> 1756.98
and I've been thinking a lot because of

1754.88 --> 1759.3200000000002
that song and like yeah how do those

1756.98 --> 1761.24
people actually live and how do they

1759.32 --> 1762.98
even

1761.24 --> 1764.98
function

1762.98 --> 1766.64
how is this

1764.98 --> 1768.919
perpetuating

1766.64 --> 1771.14
especially like how is it perpetuating

1768.919 --> 1776.14
psychology societally like are people

1771.14 --> 1776.14
literally doing that to them on purpose

1776.84 --> 1782.299
or is it like their own unique method to

1780.08 --> 1785.9189999999999
kind of get through poverty it's like

1782.299 --> 1785.9189999999999
maybe it's like a holy mission

1785.96 --> 1789.3400000000001
that's not like that

1789.5 --> 1793.039
but just like a tradition of like

1791.36 --> 1795.799
everybody's always starving so there's

1793.039 --> 1798.32
like all these disciplines on how to do

1795.799 --> 1800.779
that and what not to do what not like

1798.32 --> 1802.8799999999999
don't stress anybody out because that'll

1800.779 --> 1806.419
literally rub your inner resources and

1802.88 --> 1808.46
[ __ ] and that changes like the entire

1806.419 --> 1811.2990000000002
culture because of that so yeah I've

1808.46 --> 1811.299
been thinking about it

1811.46 --> 1818.6000000000001
much more than all people in in their

1814.94 --> 1821.2
medical experiment damage I mean yeah I

1818.6 --> 1821.1999999999998
get it already

1822.14 --> 1828.279
been immersed in that [ __ ] continually

1825.74 --> 1828.279
so

1828.32 --> 1832.1
nobody cares about starving Africans

1830.899 --> 1833.51
right now

1832.1 --> 1836.6
not really

1833.51 --> 1839.539
[Music]

1836.6 --> 1842.4189999999999
other than using it for some liberal

1839.539 --> 1845.48
virtual signal or something right

1842.419 --> 1848.48
so I just used it like oh nobody's

1845.48 --> 1850.46
thinking about that right now

1848.48 --> 1852.679
except for Jim Bob who brought it up

1850.46 --> 1854.299
weirdly enough might have been purely

1852.679 --> 1856.88
coincidental

1854.299 --> 1858.2
I think it was but it just like drove me

1856.88 --> 1860.0590000000002
and it was like

1858.2 --> 1862.46
thinking about it like

1860.059 --> 1864.6789999999999
yeah those people that has been a thing

1862.46 --> 1866.419
for a very long time why is it like that

1864.679 --> 1868.3990000000001
why is it really like that not because

1866.419 --> 1870.26
of the [ __ ] story so we get fed

1868.399 --> 1873.1399999999999
about why it is that way and what we're

1870.26 --> 1875.059
gonna do about it no what is actually

1873.14 --> 1877.72
happening there

1875.059 --> 1877.72
right

1880.1 --> 1885.6789999999999
embrace the fast clean you out yeah

1882.74 --> 1888.679
but if you then never eat

1885.679 --> 1890.96
right then it does start to wear on you

1888.679 --> 1893.0
you run out of proteins

1890.96 --> 1897.1000000000001
and fats and your brain stops

1893.0 --> 1897.1
functioning in certain ways

1898.7 --> 1903.02
so yeah fasting is cool but that's not

1901.279 --> 1906.279
what they're doing they're literally

1903.02 --> 1908.62
like Perpetual first breatharian almost

1906.279 --> 1910.76
well it is

1908.62 --> 1915.6399999999999
borders that

1910.76 --> 1915.64
it there is this thing about that yes

1918.32 --> 1925.1
my

1920.44 --> 1928.1000000000001
mystery that I want to solve is like why

1925.1 --> 1931.1789999999999
why is it like that there

1928.1 --> 1934.1589999999999
what is keeping it like that there is it

1931.179 --> 1936.8600000000001
Outsiders that are just like caging them

1934.159 --> 1940.6000000000001
in and just doing that

1936.86 --> 1940.6
for some freaky reason

1941.419 --> 1945.14
like how is how does it get to that

1943.76 --> 1948.2
point every time

1945.14 --> 1950.72
why do we keep seeing that or is it even

1948.2 --> 1954.32
really like that everywhere continually

1950.72 --> 1956.3600000000001
or is it just like some period and the

1954.32 --> 1958.7
same images get recycled over and over

1956.36 --> 1961.1
again even though it's it might be

1958.7 --> 1962.779
already over

1961.1 --> 1966.1
and they're not like that anymore I

1962.779 --> 1966.1
don't know I don't know

1968.74 --> 1972.02
I mean there's still going to be poor

1970.94 --> 1977.38
people there

1972.02 --> 1977.3799999999999
but like really totally starving right

1980.65 --> 1983.709
[Music]

1984.74 --> 1988.58
anyway

1986.13 --> 1991.7
[Music]

1988.58 --> 1994.46
although look Africa 2 of course is

1991.7 --> 1998.059
going to have issues because of the

1994.46 --> 2002.2
supply chain breakdowns also known as

1998.059 --> 2004.36
the resource Siege right they're going

2002.2 --> 2005.919
to be affected by that as well a lot I

2004.36 --> 2008.4399999999998
mean all that

2005.919 --> 2011.0800000000002
food production breakdown in the west

2008.44 --> 2012.64
which is part of the material Siege and

2011.08 --> 2015.1
the energy breakdown

2012.64 --> 2017.26
yeah that's going to influence

2015.1 --> 2019.48
Africa enormously because those

2017.26 --> 2020.519
countries do not have that kind of food

2019.48 --> 2024.519
production

2020.519 --> 2024.519
capabilities like

2024.64 --> 2030.3400000000001
the yeah the ground's just not suited

2027.94 --> 2032.44
for that might never become or it will

2030.34 --> 2035.62
take enormous amount of investment and

2032.44 --> 2037.3600000000001
Work Direct transform it into actual

2035.62 --> 2039.4599999999998
long-term viable

2037.36 --> 2041.26
ground to grow crops on it's like it's

2039.46 --> 2044.8600000000001
not going to happen

2041.26 --> 2046.6589999999999
so they are dependent on the food that

2044.86 --> 2048.399
is produced in well countries like the

2046.659 --> 2051.159
Netherlands

2048.399 --> 2054.399
massive milk

2051.159 --> 2058.26
production milk powder a lot of it does

2054.399 --> 2058.2599999999998
get shipped to Africa

2059.02 --> 2063.639
right

2060.159 --> 2065.9190000000003
so they might now be just in a

2063.639 --> 2068.76
massive starvation and nobody's even

2065.919 --> 2068.7599999999998
hearing about it

2068.8 --> 2073.0
because we're too preoccupied with well

2071.02 --> 2074.239
with what's causing the issues right

2073.0 --> 2077.509
here at home

2074.239 --> 2077.509
[Music]

2078.76 --> 2084.159
fix is doing good there is no Dome and

2081.76 --> 2087.179
it doesn't get damaged

2084.159 --> 2087.179
that's ridiculous

2089.879 --> 2094.2599999999998
Africa is full of wild meat

2095.42 --> 2100.06
[Music]

2098.5 --> 2102.82
it's not

2100.06 --> 2106.54
great though

2102.82 --> 2109.06
to just survive on that

2106.54 --> 2112.06
and I mean it's wild meat also means

2109.06 --> 2113.44
wild parasites

2112.06 --> 2117.7599999999998
and

2113.44 --> 2119.98
yeah that's mostly it right diseases

2117.76 --> 2122.2000000000003
like in the flesh

2119.98 --> 2124.8
and all that I mean

2122.2 --> 2124.7999999999997
dude

2128.14 --> 2133.0
and besides there's a lot of people in

2130.3 --> 2136.2000000000003
Africa all that wild meat how much of it

2133.0 --> 2136.2
do you think there even is

2138.339 --> 2144.52
I mean like that will absolutely run out

2142.0 --> 2147.099
and then literally force will just be

2144.52 --> 2148.9
void of animals

2147.099 --> 2151.599
okay

2148.9 --> 2154.0
if they'd have to purely survive on

2151.599 --> 2156.88
freaking wild meat it's a giant disaster

2154.0 --> 2159.94
giant ecological disaster Extinction

2156.88 --> 2164.52
animal Extinction event yeah

2159.94 --> 2164.52
that sucks that idea is [ __ ]

2166.96 --> 2170.729
[Music]

2172.78 --> 2177.5400000000004
yeah yeah clap Ruckus hello by the way

2178.359 --> 2184.839
that's right no he was trying that

2182.2 --> 2187.68
yeah Gaddafi

2184.839 --> 2191.56
is trying to get the Subterranean Waters

2187.68 --> 2194.5
which are incredibly pristine apparently

2191.56 --> 2196.72
and use them as yeah to water the the

2194.5 --> 2200.02
land and create

2196.72 --> 2203.0789999999997
farming grounds among other maybe even

2200.02 --> 2206.579
like new forests probably

2203.079 --> 2206.579
but yeah they didn't like that

2227.56 --> 2230.46
foreign

2235.59 --> 2238.8
[Music]

2241.98 --> 2246.06
Because by the way and that's weird

2246.76 --> 2251.719
[Music]

2272.44 --> 2275.8
right anyway

2273.86 --> 2279.1600000000003
[Music]

2275.8 --> 2281.2000000000003
yeah yeah I've been thinking but I think

2279.16 --> 2283.839
about that like in the background right

2281.2 --> 2286.24
because I mean

2283.839 --> 2288.7
we should learn

2286.24 --> 2291.52
from other scenarios where people are

2288.7 --> 2294.4199999999996
being besieged and starved and

2291.52 --> 2294.42
suppressed

2294.7 --> 2301.359
because we are under it and if you want

2297.52 --> 2304.42
to survive that you're gonna need to be

2301.359 --> 2307.72
first off a where that is happening

2304.42 --> 2310.2000000000003
and then try to figure a way through

2307.72 --> 2312.9399999999996
by learning from other

2310.2 --> 2314.3199999999997
scenarios where that has happened in

2312.94 --> 2316.119
other ways

2314.32 --> 2318.04
because the spirit of it is and the end

2316.119 --> 2321.04
like it's always happening for the same

2318.04 --> 2324.119
reason right Siege always happens for

2321.04 --> 2324.119
the same reason always

2332.5 --> 2337.98
[Music]

2335.38 --> 2337.98
anywhere

2338.859 --> 2341.94
I agree

2342.06 --> 2348.7
I I heard that phraseology somewhere I

2345.64 --> 2352.3199999999997
don't know what it is though

2348.7 --> 2352.3199999999997

right so yeah anything you guys want to

2422.14 --> 2424.44
talk about

2426.88 --> 2431.079
other than the siege I mean it's making

2428.92 --> 2434.76
me hungry

2431.079 --> 2434.76
I haven't had any breakfast yet

2448.359 --> 2451.359
foreign

2452.54 --> 2460.199
[Music]

2482.74 --> 2486.4799999999996
how are they doing that though

2487.599 --> 2491.98
are they doing that heavy investment

2490.0 --> 2496.98
thing

2491.98 --> 2496.98
like because that's very expensive

2497.44 --> 2503.76
but maybe they're just doing that and

2499.599 --> 2503.76
really creating the long-term farmland

2506.5 --> 2512.8
right if they import a whole bunch of

2508.66 --> 2514.24
dirt like a good soil

2512.8 --> 2516.46
yeah

2514.24 --> 2520.74
you can actually yeah if you have that

2516.46 --> 2520.7400000000002
money and people yeah it's available

2527.02 --> 2532.3
now that dude

2529.0 --> 2535.06
a bunch of CO2 and even water is not

2532.3 --> 2536.44
just gonna transform desert sand into

2535.06 --> 2539.5789999999997
farming land

2536.44 --> 2539.579
doesn't work like that

2550.079 --> 2556.3590000000004
foreign you need the

2553.619 --> 2559.06
bacteria in the soil you need the fungi

2556.359 --> 2560.3199999999997
in the soil they don't exist in desert

2559.06 --> 2563.339
sand

2560.32 --> 2563.339
it's all dead

2563.38 --> 2573.42
you see

2565.07 --> 2573.42
[Music]

2577.599 --> 2583.3590000000004
hey Michael Khan good to see you

2579.72 --> 2585.7799999999997
skeptic936 good to see you

2583.359 --> 2585.7799999999997
foreign

2604.18 --> 2607.359
okay

2605.68 --> 2610.5989999999997
are you saying that they're like

2607.359 --> 2612.7
scooping all the desert sand away are

2610.599 --> 2614.88
they like poldering the desert or

2612.7 --> 2614.8799999999997
something

2616.599 --> 2619.98
is that durable

2623.319 --> 2626.22
I don't get it

2646.0 --> 2649.0
desalination

2650.2 --> 2652.7999999999997
okay

2653.14 --> 2658.2999999999997
yeah many plants but I mean that it

2655.96 --> 2661.18
doesn't make good Farm ground though

2658.3 --> 2663.6600000000003
just because it's possible for plants to

2661.18 --> 2663.66
grow in there

2668.44 --> 2671.52
okay interesting

2674.64 --> 2679.7799999999997
right but that that's an interesting

2677.14 --> 2682.359
little factoid apparently salts in

2679.78 --> 2685.0600000000004
desert said is what really kills the

2682.359 --> 2686.56
plants makes it not viable for them I

2685.06 --> 2688.54
didn't even know there was all kinds of

2686.56 --> 2689.92
salt in there but

2688.54 --> 2692.56
sure

2689.92 --> 2694.9
but just because that's out of there

2692.56 --> 2697.599
still doesn't make it certainly good

2694.9 --> 2699.579
farming land I mean yeah some plants

2697.599 --> 2702.4
might grow onto it but it doesn't make

2699.579 --> 2705.52
it actual fertile soil

2702.4 --> 2708.4
takes a lot more than that

2705.52 --> 2709.96
like you have to grow the soil I talked

2708.4 --> 2712.319
about this by the way like four years

2709.96 --> 2712.319
ago

2715.56 --> 2723.7599999999998
soil turns to sand yeah it can happen

2719.8 --> 2727.2400000000002
it can wither and like break apart

2723.76 --> 2729.2200000000003
but it doesn't go the other way around

2727.24 --> 2731.9799999999996
you don't just like oh you can't just

2729.22 --> 2733.8999999999996
reverse the process and like oh yeah

2731.98 --> 2736.54
we're gonna turn sand back into Soul

2733.9 --> 2738.46
that's not gonna be easy

2736.54 --> 2740.2
basically going to turn out to be like

2738.46 --> 2743.44
you're gonna have to mix it up with

2740.2 --> 2747.16
living soil because soil is alive

2743.44 --> 2751.18
like that brown black dirt with all the

2747.16 --> 2753.7799999999997
stuff in it that's a living thing

2751.18 --> 2757.4489999999996
it's not just a bunch of minerals

2862.78 --> 2869.079
he was doing that among other things he

2865.9 --> 2872.2000000000003
was also creating a gold standard

2869.079 --> 2874.42
right that is probably the thing that

2872.2 --> 2875.9199999999996
actually got him to post

2874.42 --> 2879.06
and murdered

2884.14 --> 2889.359

Water Project yeah falling out it's just

2889.359 --> 2894.46
a tragic tragic side effect really

2892.359 --> 2895.5299999999997

2900.46 --> 2905.14
oh yeah yeah you go do that

2903.22 --> 2906.8999999999996
and then and then we get the central

2905.14 --> 2910.9
bank right

2906.9 --> 2913.42
and then Gaddafi was like no no we're

2910.9 --> 2916.9
gonna have a gold standard how dare you

2913.42 --> 2919.7200000000003
you're evil you're gonna die right

2916.9 --> 2921.819
because yeah sure Grapplers love an

2919.72 --> 2924.4599999999996
upcoming blooming country that's

2921.819 --> 2925.9
transforming and because they make a lot

2924.46 --> 2931.06
of money

2925.9 --> 2932.38
right they want their money is how many

2931.06 --> 2935.2599999999998
right

2932.38 --> 2937.96
and if they then can't get it yeah then

2935.26 --> 2941.3390000000004
they destroy it all

2937.96 --> 2941.339

right so talking about farming in I

3136.8 --> 3141.6800000000003
guess Saudi Arabia

3138.839 --> 3141.68
not yet

3142.2 --> 3144.7999999999997
that's my God

3144.9 --> 3149.76
well

3146.819 --> 3151.44
hold on yeah this is number one

3149.76 --> 3154.5
number two

3151.44 --> 3157.94
up close man

3154.5 --> 3157.94
that's pretty freaking big

3163.32 --> 3166.679
[Music]

3166.98 --> 3169.52
right

3170.339 --> 3173.24
the problem

3190.319 --> 3196.44
right but I think you're like

3193.38 --> 3198.359
if you think that for example flat

3196.44 --> 3200.339
Earth's dealing

3198.359 --> 3203.7599999999998
with Ballers and like for example

3200.339 --> 3206.16
Nathan's interview right with with the

3203.76 --> 3209.1600000000003
with the baller guys the supposed Navy

3206.16 --> 3211.3799999999997
guys how strenuous that is

3209.16 --> 3216.24
well

3211.38 --> 3219.0
that reviewer I send you a link of like

3216.24 --> 3221.16
he makes a joke out of it but he is

3219.0 --> 3224.339
literally going through that level of

3221.16 --> 3227.2799999999997
stress sometimes with his reviews

3224.339 --> 3229.619
the ID doesn't really do it this type of

3227.28 --> 3232.079
movie anymore by the way it hasn't

3229.619 --> 3235.38
he's like gotten much more milk toast

3232.079 --> 3237.119
right now in the in the recent few years

3235.38 --> 3239.52
but

3237.119 --> 3241.7400000000002
back then it was like a lot of his

3239.52 --> 3243.42
reviews are like this but this one is

3241.74 --> 3246.66
just

3243.42 --> 3248.099
and it reminds me so much about like

3246.66 --> 3251.7599999999998
he's just

3248.099 --> 3255.9
trying to deal with stupid movies and

3251.76 --> 3258.2400000000002
it's like taking the life out of him

3255.9 --> 3260.819
right

3258.24 --> 3263.4799999999996
like we're dealing with really stupid

3260.819 --> 3263.48
ballers

3263.579 --> 3267.6600000000003
so funny to me I don't know

3265.92 --> 3269.579
I have been following that guy like

3267.66 --> 3273.1189999999997
since 2000

3269.579 --> 3277.88
six so now wait 2008.

3273.119 --> 3277.88
so yeah he's been around for a while

3278.22 --> 3281.35
[Music]

3282.9 --> 3287.339
have you even been in this in his live

3285.18 --> 3291.7799999999997
chat by the way sometimes streams on

3287.339 --> 3294.14
life on YouTube now playing games video

3291.78 --> 3294.1400000000003
games

3294.78 --> 3298.8300000000004
sometimes

3296.28 --> 3302.3390000000004
even popped in the chat

3298.83 --> 3304.7599999999998
[Music]

3302.339 --> 3306.2999999999997
anyway that's

3304.76 --> 3308.1800000000003
[Music]

3306.3 --> 3313.15
for some other day

3308.18 --> 3313.1499999999996
[Music]

3321.599 --> 3324.92
he was angry

3324.96 --> 3327.859
wow

3328.14 --> 3333.9
he was angry at you for posting fake

3331.079 --> 3335.88
Space videos because he worked on the

3333.9 --> 3338.04
Hubble telescope

3335.88 --> 3341.42
and the lyrics

3338.04 --> 3341.42
and got paid a lot

3343.26 --> 3347.7000000000003
he probably felt he was doing he really

3345.96 --> 3350.48
deserved that because he was doing a

3347.7 --> 3350.48
really awesome thing

3352.2 --> 3357.7799999999997
and then realizing it is fake

3355.619 --> 3362.6600000000003
makes him suddenly feel not so good

3357.78 --> 3362.6600000000003
about himself for receiving that fortune

3362.7 --> 3366.14
so that's probably the reason

3368.88 --> 3375.839
stupid Ballers however excuse me but

3372.66 --> 3379.0789999999997
those guys that Nathan was on with are

3375.839 --> 3381.359
stupid Ballers yeah

3379.079 --> 3382.92
that doesn't mean that all Ballers are

3381.359 --> 3386.22
stupid

3382.92 --> 3388.88
or not all very stupid let's just say it

3386.22 --> 3388.8799999999997
like that but

3389.16 --> 3393.359
they're stupid flat earthers do that

3391.619 --> 3396.1400000000003
doesn't mean that all flat earthers are

3393.359 --> 3396.14
stupid so

3400.38 --> 3405.1800000000003
oh it was a joke

3402.48 --> 3407.33
of course it was

3405.18 --> 3410.52
ah

3407.33 --> 3410.52
[Music]

3410.76 --> 3419.289
completely

3412.33 --> 3419.2889999999998
[Music]

3419.4 --> 3423.78
oh he didn't tell you he didn't tell you

3422.099 --> 3426.0
his involvement you had to hear it from

3423.78 --> 3427.8
from somebody else well then it's

3426.0 --> 3431.3
obvious then he was really then he's

3427.8 --> 3431.3
like embarrassed and ashamed

3440.22 --> 3446.72
what

3442.559 --> 3446.7200000000003
what are you talking about your Sanford

3454.8 --> 3459.98
you didn't see that one with Nathan okay

3464.099 --> 3467.76
well

3465.119 --> 3469.1400000000003
let me summarize it it was incredibly

3467.76 --> 3471.48
embarrassing

3469.14 --> 3475.22
for them

3471.48 --> 3479.66
they were rumpusing ad humming and

3475.22 --> 3479.66
literally ignoring arguments

3484.74 --> 3488.7599999999998
if you want to check something out

3486.66 --> 3491.2799999999997
without watching the whole thing that

3488.76 --> 3493.619
Nathan has posted small clips about

3491.28 --> 3495.78
shorts about it that are like

3493.619 --> 3498.42
30 seconds a minute

3495.78 --> 3499.559
so you can get the gist of it if you

3498.42 --> 3502.79
like

3499.559 --> 3505.949
you don't have to watch the whole thing

3502.79 --> 3505.949
[Music]

3507.3 --> 3509.3
um

3517.73 --> 3523.9
[Music]

3532.5 --> 3536.76
you caught that

3534.119 --> 3539.2200000000003
good and you turret no I was just being

3536.76 --> 3541.88
autistic about it

3539.22 --> 3541.8799999999997
foreign

3543.2 --> 3548.8799999999997
like I have that thing it's inherent to

3546.299 --> 3551.579
me it's not the universal it's just like

3548.88 --> 3553.44
sometimes I'm I'm just not seeing that

3551.579 --> 3556.5
it's a joke even though it should be

3553.44 --> 3558.059
quite plainly it's like

3556.5 --> 3562.579
almost

3558.059 --> 3562.579
I accidentally ignore it's a joke

3566.339 --> 3569.599
does that make any sense

3570.44 --> 3574.76
uh it didn't happen sometimes

3578.04 --> 3582.54
I mean if if it's like a bit of a giddy

3580.44 --> 3584.819
mood and there's like silly jokes being

3582.54 --> 3586.2599999999998
made obviously I did do that earlier

3584.819 --> 3588.299
though

3586.26 --> 3589.8590000000004
then while I'm doing that while I'm in

3588.299 --> 3592.079
that what like while I'm seeing people

3589.859 --> 3595.38
like giggling and whatever around me

3592.079 --> 3597.1800000000003
physically or hearing them then that

3595.38 --> 3599.7000000000003
makes me

3597.18 --> 3603.24
recognize that something is a joke a lot

3599.7 --> 3605.7
quicker because it's happening like

3603.24 --> 3607.9799999999996
we're in that then and then I recognize

3605.7 --> 3610.46
it but like when I'm just like standing

3607.98 --> 3614.66
by just reading things I don't

3610.46 --> 3614.66
automatically see something as a joke

3617.099 --> 3620.75
sometimes

3618.72 --> 3623.8999999999996
yeah just happens

3620.75 --> 3623.9
[Music]

3631.74 --> 3635.1189999999997
although I should have seen that

3635.76 --> 3641.099
who says very dare you

3639.059 --> 3643.88
that yeah

3641.099 --> 3643.88
I don't know

3646.319 --> 3652.98
might have been like a bigoted reaction

3648.78 --> 3656.0
a bit because I know Orinoco is a baller

3652.98 --> 3656.0
so I just

3657.24 --> 3662.04
yeah that might have just happened

3659.94 --> 3664.38
I took it literally I didn't see the

3662.04 --> 3667.2
joke because I was

3664.38 --> 3668.1600000000003
in my Minds like oh the a baller

3667.2 --> 3670.799
reaction

3668.16 --> 3673.44
that might have been it sorry about that

3670.799 --> 3675.0
I mean it still happens especially like

3673.44 --> 3676.2000000000003
yeah

3675.0 --> 3679.74
I mean

3676.2 --> 3683.04
tensions have to don't have what am I

3679.74 --> 3685.8799999999997
saying man when tensions go up that sort

3683.04 --> 3685.88
of thing does happen

3686.16 --> 3693.72
like those reactions are based on more

3688.859 --> 3697.46
tense situations that aren't there

3693.72 --> 3697.4599999999996
it's like anticipation anyway

3698.28 --> 3702.98
not really a joke call it later yeah

3700.74 --> 3702.9799999999996
sure

3705.839 --> 3709.64
I'm over analyzing this [ __ ]

3730.68 --> 3736.98
why do astronomer

3733.74 --> 3740.22
but what astronomer

3736.98 --> 3743.64
you mean astronaut right

3740.22 --> 3748.0789999999997
blankets of it well I can make a Baldwin

3743.64 --> 3752.04
excuse for that if you like I mean yeah

3748.079 --> 3753.98
if you're suddenly going to transition

3752.04 --> 3756.9
from a

3753.98 --> 3760.859
non-zero G environment to a g

3756.9 --> 3763.26
environment your body is gonna undergo

3760.859 --> 3765.72
stress

3763.26 --> 3767.099
and that stress from the massive

3765.72 --> 3771.24
transition

3767.099 --> 3773.1600000000003
it's like a fever you will go sweating

3771.24 --> 3775.5789999999997
okay there you go that's why they need

3773.16 --> 3775.5789999999997
blankets

3776.11 --> 3785.28
[Music]

3782.04 --> 3787.44
I mean it's not unreasonable

3785.28 --> 3791.2200000000003
if you go through under dramatic

3787.44 --> 3793.92
scenario changes in your experience

3791.22 --> 3797.8799999999997
you're gonna have physical issues it's

3793.92 --> 3799.799
just like being in a pressurized suit

3797.88 --> 3804.359
in the deep ocean

3799.799 --> 3806.16
right you need time to adapt

3804.359 --> 3808.74
and if you don't have like a pressure

3806.16 --> 3811.74
chamber to properly do it you can you'll

3808.74 --> 3813.8999999999996
get very sick potentially dying

3811.74 --> 3815.339
right so

3813.9 --> 3817.7400000000002
think of that

3815.339 --> 3821.819
of course the analogy the comparison is

3817.74 --> 3823.6189999999997
right into water but that's secondary

3821.819 --> 3825.42
the point is is that yeah if you're

3823.619 --> 3828.119
supposed to transition from one

3825.42 --> 3830.94
environment to another that's gonna have

3828.119 --> 3833.52
a physical response of which is compared

3830.94 --> 3835.079
to Fever it's adaptation it's discomfort

3833.52 --> 3837.42
you're probably going to be sweating

3835.079 --> 3839.04
which would not be because of the

3837.42 --> 3840.48
temperature but because of the bodily

3839.04 --> 3843.02
stress

3840.48 --> 3843.02
foreign

3852.44 --> 3859.099
legs but that doesn't happen that

3854.64 --> 3859.0989999999997
quickly Michael Khan that's that's silly

3863.22 --> 3869.04
I mean unless you're you've allegedly

3865.92 --> 3871.619
been in space for years

3869.04 --> 3875.9
yeah then but hey there's special

3871.619 --> 3875.9
programs for that I mean they have like

3876.059 --> 3882.059
like what do you call those uh treadmill

3879.599 --> 3884.579
things to keep your legs I mean they

3882.059 --> 3887.4
even showed that in 2001 Space that they

3884.579 --> 3888.96
see because yeah if you're gonna stay in

3887.4 --> 3890.339
a zero g environment for a very long

3888.96 --> 3892.2
time you're gonna need to train those

3890.339 --> 3894.42
legs or they'll

3892.2 --> 3899.359
stop growing

3894.42 --> 3899.359
like they'll build down your muscle

3900.18 --> 3904.04
right

3901.5 --> 3904.04
but

3905.579 --> 3911.52
I think that like imagine that you're

3908.339 --> 3913.319
stuck in like a really small space for a

3911.52 --> 3916.819
very long time

3913.319 --> 3920.2799999999997
like half a year stuck in like a

3916.819 --> 3921.54
miniature chamber

3920.28 --> 3924.2400000000002
right

3921.54 --> 3926.339
that's gonna make everything wither not

3924.24 --> 3928.74
just your legs it's gonna be your arms

3926.339 --> 3931.5589999999997
too because you can't move

3928.74 --> 3934.0789999999997
you're in a cage

3931.559 --> 3936.3590000000004
everything's gonna then have be burdened

3934.079 --> 3938.88
by that right

3936.359 --> 3941.2799999999997
you can't like stretch your legs even in

3938.88 --> 3944.52
the freaking capsule so

3941.28 --> 3947.28
that compounds the situation more than

3944.52 --> 3949.2599999999998
just oh my legs are too weak no your

3947.28 --> 3950.5400000000004
entire body you've been in a freaking

3949.26 --> 3954.48
cage

3950.54 --> 3957.7799999999997
for who knows how long

3954.48 --> 3960.119
in a totally unnatural environment with

3957.78 --> 3961.799
alleged zero g i mean what the [ __ ] do

3960.119 --> 3964.579
you expect

3961.799 --> 3964.579
it's torturous

3964.799 --> 3967.4
anyway

3970.28 --> 3976.4
s right they have a thread mill on the

3973.98 --> 3976.4
ISS

3977.7 --> 3984.02
UE treadmill is it yeah

3979.74 --> 3984.02
treadmill a threat meal

3987.059 --> 3993.5
let's grind those threads

3990.9 --> 3993.5
all right

3993.86 --> 3997.789
[Music]

4017.0 --> 4019.599
what

4020.78 --> 4024.3390000000004
placing blankets

4029.9 --> 4033.46
I don't understand what

4035.839 --> 4039.7
I don't understand turret

4039.799 --> 4045.339
I I do not understand what you're

4042.02 --> 4045.339
talking about what do you mean

4063.619 --> 4066.619
foreign

4067.95 --> 4071.1499999999996
[Music]

4071.96 --> 4077.299
by the way also uh

4074.78 --> 4081.3190000000004
you you got like

4077.299 --> 4083.299
space ship suits

4081.319 --> 4086.48
and you got like

4083.299 --> 4088.88
outs like outer atmosphere astronaut

4086.48 --> 4091.94
suits right with the big packages where

4088.88 --> 4095.6800000000003
they supposedly walked on the moon with

4091.94 --> 4095.68
those suits are different

4097.4 --> 4102.5599999999995
I mean those outer space suits yeah

4099.92 --> 4105.02
they're supposedly isolated perfectly

4102.56 --> 4108.02
you could walk around with them in the

4105.02 --> 4109.64
in a very cold place allegedly without

4108.02 --> 4112.279
any problems

4109.64 --> 4116.359
except for maneuverability Maybe

4112.279 --> 4118.339000000001
but with the regular stuff they have on

4116.359 --> 4121.160000000001
it's it's just an outfit that's not

4118.339 --> 4123.62
really a spacesuit so yeah they would

4121.16 --> 4125.7789999999995
probably require blankets so I'm not

4123.62 --> 4130.2
entirely sure what footage you're

4125.779 --> 4133.410000000001
referencing but I mean foreign

4130.2 --> 4133.41
[Music]

4134.44 --> 4139.7789999999995
the big trick or whatever I don't see it

4144.44 --> 4149.44
expensive spacesuits yeah but were they

4146.66 --> 4149.44
even wearing them

4153.199 --> 4159.739
I'm sure the suits were expensive but

4155.359 --> 4162.38
were they actually wearing those suits

4159.739 --> 4165.139999999999
don't they put the suit on when they

4162.38 --> 4167.54
make spacewalks and then they get back

4165.14 --> 4170.299
in and they take them off again like

4167.54 --> 4175.0
those are the actual spacesuits it's

4170.299 --> 4175.0
it's not their regular uniform thing

4175.339 --> 4179.839
they're not gonna be inside of a

4177.679 --> 4184.0
spacesuit when they come when they land

4179.839 --> 4184.0
back on Earth okay that makes no sense

4186.14 --> 4190.64
because those things are extremely

4187.759 --> 4192.5
inmaneuverable you can't they're

4190.64 --> 4195.5
intenable

4192.5 --> 4196.94
you can't just do that like how are you

4195.5 --> 4200.38
going to operate the spaceship with

4196.94 --> 4200.379999999999
those things on that's ridiculous

4207.92 --> 4212.02
that would be fabric spacesuit

4212.719 --> 4219.64
it isn't it's just a uniform

4216.5 --> 4219.64
it's not a spacesuit

4224.12 --> 4228.38
maybe it's a space

4226.4 --> 4233.32
suit

4228.38 --> 4233.32
themed uniform ever considered that

4234.98 --> 4241.218999999999
right more in the directions of like

4237.08 --> 4244.64
pressurized pilot suits for really fast

4241.219 --> 4247.34
planes right for super fast fighter jets

4244.64 --> 4250.04
they have like pressurized stuff there

4247.34 --> 4251.84
it's not because oh

4250.04 --> 4254.659
it's because they need pressure

4251.84 --> 4256.64
regulation because of the extreme

4254.659 --> 4258.0199999999995
extremities they're being subjected to

4256.64 --> 4262.1
physically

4258.02 --> 4266.1990000000005
right it's not because they need to go

4262.1 --> 4266.1990000000005
outside in a vacuum with that no

4266.54 --> 4271.1
so I think you're looking it in the

4269.42 --> 4273.56
wrong you're searching in the wrong

4271.1 --> 4276.08
direction I mean that what they were

4273.56 --> 4278.780000000001
wearing when they get back on Earth is

4276.08 --> 4281.0199999999995
not the outer space suit that makes no

4278.78 --> 4281.0199999999995
sense

4298.76 --> 4306.280000000001
the motorcycle spacesuit of space right

4302.78 --> 4306.28
yeah this yeah

4312.38 --> 4316.400000000001
it's all bull looks anyway yeah but how

4314.78 --> 4320.54
about you get the bollocks correct

4316.4 --> 4324.199
instead of Miss blabbering about it

4320.54 --> 4325.219
giving the actual Believers of this

4324.199 --> 4327.98
thing

4325.219 --> 4330.62
a look at you as like yeah

4327.98 --> 4331.82
see flat earthers are stupid they get it

4330.62 --> 4334.5199999999995
all wrong

4331.82 --> 4335.54
yeah that's the objection you get it

4334.52 --> 4337.219
wrong

4335.54 --> 4340.04
that makes you look stupid doesn't

4337.219 --> 4343.1
matter whether it's [ __ ] real or not

4340.04 --> 4344.48
if you get it wrong it makes you look

4343.1 --> 4347.679
stupid

4344.48 --> 4347.678999999999
it matters

4349.56 --> 4360.34
[Music]

4356.84 --> 4360.34
what the [ __ ] is that

4361.46 --> 4364.46
seriously

4366.02 --> 4371.2390000000005
but those are not the outer space suits

4368.54 --> 4373.699
those are the

4371.239 --> 4376.4
the suits they wear you they wear like

4373.699 --> 4379.159
during the those are not the things they

4376.4 --> 4383.0599999999995
go out making space walks with

4379.159 --> 4384.679
can we be clear thank you by the way LSG

4383.06 --> 4388.52
for that

4384.679 --> 4393.64
but uh yeah I mean I totally called it

4388.52 --> 4393.64
those are not Space Walk suits

4394.34 --> 4396.52
foreign

4397.179 --> 4403.82
let me present what LSG just sent me

4401.84 --> 4407.7390000000005
right

4403.82 --> 4407.739
that's not a spacewalk suit

4411.44 --> 4416.32
and yes the blankets do look very silly

4417.92 --> 4424.04
arroz Cosmos

4420.56 --> 4426.6990000000005
right this one again

4424.04 --> 4426.699
foreign

4434.48 --> 4442.04
yeah it is can we be clear that that's

4438.14 --> 4446.02
not a space walk suit

4442.04 --> 4446.0199999999995
do you know the difference

4447.56 --> 4452.719
I mean you're triggering my ball win

4449.6 --> 4455.0
here stop getting things wrong it does

4452.719 --> 4457.1
matter it doesn't matter whether it's

4455.0 --> 4459.88
real or not if you get it wrong it makes

4457.1 --> 4459.88
you look stupid

4461.6 --> 4464.56
foreign

4467.739 --> 4474.08
looks like you can add yeah I'm sure

4470.179 --> 4478.54
they can it's not a space walk suit

4474.08 --> 4478.54
though now is it

4480.13 --> 4487.219
[Music]

4483.86 --> 4490.159
yeah again I mean do I have to repeat

4487.219 --> 4493.34
this is that a spacewalk suit

4490.159 --> 4496.339999999999
or is it not because it looks to me more

4493.34 --> 4499.9400000000005
like a pilot suit which is the thing I

4496.34 --> 4503.4800000000005
just described they use for air jet

4499.94 --> 4506.239
Pilots that fly at extreme speeds like

4503.48 --> 4507.379999999999
stealth fighter type pilots and [ __ ]

4506.239 --> 4510.08
yeah

4507.38 --> 4512.0
they kind of look a bit like a space

4510.08 --> 4514.36
suit but they're not they're a pressure

4512.0 --> 4514.36
suit

4514.88 --> 4519.62
yeah they're not meant for spacewalks

4517.4 --> 4522.199
and neither are these things these are

4519.62 --> 4524.78
their piloting suits the thing they wear

4522.199 --> 4529.28
in the

4524.78 --> 4530.78
spaceship not for space walks I mean how

4529.28 --> 4532.55
many freaking times do I have to say

4530.78 --> 4535.739
this

4532.55 --> 4535.7390000000005
[Music]

4536.179 --> 4540.62
yeah and the price will have been

4538.04 --> 4544.699
astronomical I'm sure of it but they're

4540.62 --> 4548.5599999999995
not spacewalk suits so please please

4544.699 --> 4548.5599999999995
stop doing that

4552.98 --> 4557.799999999999
and yes it still looks silly putting

4555.739 --> 4561.44
them in a blanket

4557.8 --> 4563.659000000001
but there's no illogic to it because

4561.44 --> 4566.36
they're not Space Walk suits those suits

4563.659 --> 4568.28
aren't meant to withstand a vacuum or

4566.36 --> 4569.29
extreme temperatures

4568.28 --> 4572.489
you get it yet

4569.29 --> 4572.489
[Music]

4576.62 --> 4581.5599999999995
don't think SpaceX does bigfox well that

4578.9 --> 4581.5599999999995
makes sense then

4581.9 --> 4585.5
because that's where you need the

4583.4 --> 4588.86
extreme suits for

4585.5 --> 4592.64
according to well

4588.86 --> 4595.0599999999995
the whole thing the Playbook of how this

4592.64 --> 4595.06
works

4596.08 --> 4602.739
oh yes Michael Khan super productive uh

4600.14 --> 4602.7390000000005
right

4603.76 --> 4609.56
yeah I'm just trying to get across here

4607.1 --> 4612.4400000000005
yeah yeah let don't let the truth

4609.56 --> 4615.92
distract you from reality

4612.44 --> 4619.759999999999
sometimes it doesn't matter whether it's

4615.92 --> 4621.86
real or not it Just matters that you

4619.76 --> 4623.360000000001
know it

4621.86 --> 4626.54
why

4623.36 --> 4630.38
because this is out there and if you get

4626.54 --> 4632.9
it wrong you look stupid even though you

4630.38 --> 4635.0
know so much you know the truth about it

4632.9 --> 4638.0
yeah well guess what it's not gonna help

4635.0 --> 4640.28
you [ __ ] if you get it wrong because

4638.0 --> 4642.38
you're sloppy because you don't care

4640.28 --> 4645.38
anymore it's all fake anyway yeah that

4642.38 --> 4649.659000000001
makes you look like a [ __ ]

4645.38 --> 4649.659000000001
yeah don't do that

4658.46 --> 4662.4800000000005
ah

4660.8 --> 4665.84
and I'm

4662.48 --> 4668.9
over dramatic over dramatizing it's a

4665.84 --> 4671.42
bit hope right just to get across could

4668.9 --> 4673.5199999999995
you get really strong at it about these

4671.42 --> 4678.96
things

4673.52 --> 4678.96
[Music]

4679.52 --> 4683.900000000001
they're trying to Captivate the viewers

4681.62 --> 4685.76
emotions and manipulating them

4683.9 --> 4687.5
yeah

4685.76 --> 4690.38
I mean everything that comes out of

4687.5 --> 4693.38
their mouth is is trash and social

4690.38 --> 4695.06
engineering right

4693.38 --> 4697.400000000001
but that's not what I was talking about

4695.06 --> 4702.5
though I totally like I wouldn't listen

4697.4 --> 4704.839999999999
to any NASA person ever or an astronaut

4702.5 --> 4710.239
not really

4704.84 --> 4714.7390000000005
but yeah this is about the logic of the

4710.239 --> 4716.78
mechanics of this theater piece

4714.739 --> 4720.08
if you get it wrong

4716.78 --> 4723.8
makes you look stupid

4720.08 --> 4726.86
so don't desperately find

4723.8 --> 4730.04
like don't expect every freaking thing

4726.86 --> 4732.259999999999
out there to be everything is wrong like

4730.04 --> 4734.78
they're always just doing putting errors

4732.26 --> 4737.14
in your face on purpose no no no no you

4734.78 --> 4740.42
you might get used to that

4737.14 --> 4744.38
then it rubs off on you and now you're

4740.42 --> 4747.56
doing it because you're getting it wrong

4744.38 --> 4749.179
and you don't even realize it anymore

4747.56 --> 4751.96
because you don't care

4749.179 --> 4751.96
not really

4752.96 --> 4756.04
you gotta get it right

4756.38 --> 4762.8
yeah just because you know the truth

4760.28 --> 4765.159
about the situation doesn't make you

4762.8 --> 4765.159000000001
better

4767.48 --> 4771.04
it makes you more responsible

4771.32 --> 4778.099999999999
but it doesn't help anybody to just say

4774.8 --> 4780.7390000000005
oh this I've just discovered it's a lie

4778.1 --> 4785.780000000001
so I'm gonna literally like just bother

4780.739 --> 4788.12
everybody and disrupt people's lives

4785.78 --> 4790.5199999999995
by bringing them information that they

4788.12 --> 4792.8
don't know what to do with

4790.52 --> 4796.52
right

4792.8 --> 4800.4400000000005
and just be super negative towards this

4796.52 --> 4800.4400000000005
thing you've identified as a lie

4800.9 --> 4807.799999999999
that turns you into a gamma in a very

4804.34 --> 4810.14
burdensome person for other people yeah

4807.8 --> 4811.9400000000005
and people won't give a [ __ ] that you

4810.14 --> 4816.219
discovered your stupid little truth

4811.94 --> 4816.219
because you're acting miserable

4816.56 --> 4822.620000000001
and stupid and arrogant

4819.739 --> 4825.0199999999995
when you do that so don't do that just

4822.62 --> 4827.179
warning you friendly warning

4825.02 --> 4830.06
warning that doesn't go away because

4827.179 --> 4831.14
this is like a struggle that never goes

4830.06 --> 4833.0
away

4831.14 --> 4835.219
you're gonna find more things that are

4833.0 --> 4837.38
fake and then you're gonna do the same

4835.219 --> 4840.62
thing if you're not careful

4837.38 --> 4843.27
you gotta get things right even if

4840.62 --> 4848.54
they're fake

4843.27 --> 4852.26
[Music]

4848.54 --> 4854.48
yeah I mean like let's for example say

4852.26 --> 4857.06
that for some reason I'm not going to do

4854.48 --> 4860.839999999999
it here theoretically

4857.06 --> 4862.88
I would start digging into virus Theory

4860.84 --> 4864.56
something I personally do not believe in

4862.88 --> 4865.82
at all I think it's Medical Science

4864.56 --> 4868.400000000001
Fiction

4865.82 --> 4871.699
but let's just say I would actually go

4868.4 --> 4874.5199999999995
in there and like oh I'm gonna criticize

4871.699 --> 4877.699
I don't know how this in this laboratory

4874.52 --> 4879.8
we all know which one something happened

4877.699 --> 4883.759999999999
and then that good consequences right

4879.8 --> 4885.56
well if I just be like oh well it's

4883.76 --> 4888.1990000000005
viruses so I don't really believe it

4885.56 --> 4890.780000000001
anyway and then get sloppy and say all

4888.199 --> 4894.0199999999995
kinds of [ __ ] things about it

4890.78 --> 4897.38
getting it wrong according to the

4894.02 --> 4899.540000000001
procedures and the models that they have

4897.38 --> 4901.400000000001
right and just say oh they're all just

4899.54 --> 4904.82
lying about everything yeah that just

4901.4 --> 4907.599999999999
makes you look like a [ __ ] yeah

4904.82 --> 4911.0599999999995
if you're gonna point out how they're

4907.6 --> 4916.76
knowingly lying in the [ __ ]

4911.06 --> 4919.52
you gotta do it within the model

4916.76 --> 4921.4400000000005
otherwise all you can prove is that

4919.52 --> 4924.4400000000005
they're delusional

4921.44 --> 4926.839999999999
and that they're going by Broken models

4924.44 --> 4928.58
that they don't let go that's all you

4926.84 --> 4930.7390000000005
can prove if you actually want to prove

4928.58 --> 4932.659
none are there knowingly lying even

4930.739 --> 4935.0
within their field then you're gonna

4932.659 --> 4938.0599999999995
have to get the models that they

4935.0 --> 4940.76
utilized correct

4938.06 --> 4944.360000000001
yeah that's not just for dealing with

4940.76 --> 4945.320000000001
NASA and Ballers no that goes in every

4944.36 --> 4947.54
field

4945.32 --> 4950.0599999999995
where there's these things

4947.54 --> 4953.54
these illusions

4950.06 --> 4955.04
that are surrounded by Power by people

4953.54 --> 4956.84
in power

4955.04 --> 4960.679
and use it

4956.84 --> 4963.02
against people against their minds

4960.679 --> 4965.6

4965.6 --> 4972.4400000000005
criticize something from within then you

4968.719 --> 4975.92

4972.44 --> 4980.86

4980.9 --> 4984.739
becoming a degenerate

5027.58 --> 5031.239
the entire thing is intainable and even

5029.86 --> 5033.339999999999
like the

5031.239 --> 5036.099999999999
let's just say the Star Trek technology

5033.34 --> 5039.52
that is supposedly there in order for

5036.1 --> 5042.219
well Star Trek universe people to

5039.52 --> 5044.56
explore space and go out there yeah well

5042.219 --> 5046.36
those things that they developed are

5044.56 --> 5049.96
extremely unreasonable

5046.36 --> 5053.5
I mean a teleporter really

5049.96 --> 5056.92
by the way it was purely born as in very

5053.5 --> 5058.48
easy easy stagecraft trick so they

5056.92 --> 5061.54
didn't have to animate some kind of

5058.48 --> 5065.86
Transporter yeah that's why it was there

5061.54 --> 5069.1
yeah well it kept getting grafted in

5065.86 --> 5072.82
in the Star Trek cosmology that's never

5069.1 --> 5075.280000000001
gonna happen nothing can work like that

5072.82 --> 5078.699
it's all science fiction the entire

5075.28 --> 5081.34
development towards that stage where

5078.699 --> 5083.379999999999
they are at in the story where Star Trek

5081.34 --> 5085.33
happens and they go out all the

5083.38 --> 5088.43
development towards that can't happen

5085.33 --> 5088.43
[Music]

5093.12 --> 5096.599999999999

5099.219 --> 5105.64
they didn't show you how it builds up

5103.42 --> 5108.159
literally

5105.64 --> 5110.9800000000005
like the engineer that just like

5108.159 --> 5112.42
basically there's no space [ __ ]

5110.98 --> 5116.04
whatsoever

5112.42 --> 5116.04
and then suddenly there is

5119.92 --> 5124.0
right they don't show you the part like

5122.02 --> 5125.8
how did they actually do that how did

5124.0 --> 5128.02
they do that they're all going by the

5125.8 --> 5131.02
assumption that NASA was real and that

5128.02 --> 5133.780000000001
there is continued progress that's what

5131.02 --> 5135.64
the Star Trek lore the Star Trek

5133.78 --> 5139.239
universe is based on

5135.64 --> 5141.820000000001
the continuation of that NASA is real

5139.239 --> 5143.98
well you should all know by now that

5141.82 --> 5147.82
that's not gonna happen

5143.98 --> 5151.36
whatever the realm is that we are in

5147.82 --> 5153.4
that way does not exist

5151.36 --> 5157.239
and who knows what's out there man I

5153.4 --> 5160.9
have speculated inside and dreamed

5157.239 --> 5162.459999999999
about things I mean who knows man the

5160.9 --> 5165.159
realm is still pretty damn big

5162.46 --> 5167.199
mysterious we don't even exactly know

5165.159 --> 5169.299999999999
where the Flat Top is I think it's flat

5167.199 --> 5171.879999999999
and we don't even know how wide the

5169.3 --> 5174.159000000001
realm really is

5171.88 --> 5177.0
and whether there's like really bizarre

5174.159 --> 5177.0
mechanics to it

5189.88 --> 5192.719
allegedly

5198.639 --> 5204.6990000000005
and then he went to blabber on about

5200.92 --> 5208.08
freaking disgusting Eugenics [ __ ]

5204.699 --> 5208.08
climate hoax

5214.719 --> 5220.9800000000005
and you wrote yeah but I thought it was

5216.28 --> 5220.98
pretty bad I mean I like the idea that

5221.02 --> 5227.639
somebody at that age would still do that

5223.659 --> 5227.638999999999
would survive that but yeah

5243.48 --> 5247.86
forget that flip phone what

5265.199 --> 5271.839999999999
so there's okay

5268.659 --> 5275.259999999999
well some of you might have forgotten

5271.84 --> 5278.5
but I personally am not like

5275.26 --> 5280.6
yeah I wasn't too happy about that

5280.6 --> 5285.88

5283.06 --> 5287.02
William Shatner as an actor his career

5285.88 --> 5288.9400000000005

I don't know

5304.659 --> 5309.0599999999995

what's the point what's his good point

6389.219 --> 6394.04
uh Ian Adams tell me his good point

6394.56 --> 6399.719
and spell it out then you read his good

6397.199 --> 6402.659
points that you said he had and then

6399.719 --> 6404.699
realize if that is actually a good point

6402.659 --> 6407.46
because I don't even know what it's

6404.699 --> 6410.699
gonna be but I can guarantee you it will

6407.46 --> 6412.619
not be a good point he is just very full

6410.699 --> 6415.5599999999995
of himself convinced that is a good

6412.619 --> 6418.679
point and he let that Rob off on you

6415.56 --> 6421.76
so that you believe it too

6418.679 --> 6421.76
that's what I think

6425.28 --> 6428.4
take your time

6426.96 --> 6431.4800000000005
I'm gonna take a two minute break break

6428.4 --> 6431.48
be right back

6495.179 --> 6498.179
foreign

6514.86 --> 6517.86
foreign

6533.639 --> 6542.6990000000005
water levels wow what a great point

6538.94 --> 6545.48
water's level and magnificent

6542.699 --> 6545.48
I mean

6545.52 --> 6553.38
didn't we figure that out in 2015.

6549.78 --> 6556.4
at the first wave I mean how is that a

6553.38 --> 6556.400000000001
magnificent point

6556.92 --> 6559.82
who cares

6562.02 --> 6569.52
I mean yeah okay but that that is it

6566.1 --> 6571.7390000000005
water is level so all those hours and

6569.52 --> 6574.7390000000005
hours and hours of wasting your time was

6571.739 --> 6577.44
worth it because he talks about water

6574.739 --> 6579.299999999999
being level

6577.44 --> 6582.08
really

6579.3 --> 6582.08
that's it

6591.42 --> 6595.639
I see Ellie's G feels the same

6601.8 --> 6608.46
yeah in the meantime he says oh the

6605.34 --> 6612.119000000001
Black Swan is disproven

6608.46 --> 6614.84
it's not accurate

6612.119 --> 6614.839999999999
dude

6629.719 --> 6636.2390000000005
while the afflictions make people say

6632.52 --> 6636.2390000000005
stupid things wow

6640.8 --> 6646.9800000000005
how productive

6643.44 --> 6649.5599999999995
yeah how about mastering that model how

6646.98 --> 6651.659
about doing what I did today yeah saying

6649.56 --> 6653.6990000000005
like hey I know it's a month it's no

6651.659 --> 6655.86
it's it's not the truth yeah

6653.699 --> 6657.48
but if you get it wrong it makes you

6655.86 --> 6661.38
look stupid

6657.48 --> 6664.44
yeah that's my contribution

6661.38 --> 6667.02
and his contribution is saying that oh

6664.44 --> 6669.5
if you believe in models you say stupid

6667.02 --> 6671.219
things

6669.5 --> 6673.619
wow

6671.219 --> 6676.34
amazing

6673.619 --> 6680.5199999999995
I mean who could figure that one out

6676.34 --> 6683.639
except for like a six-year-old

6680.52 --> 6685.679
yeah if you believe in things you don't

6683.639 --> 6687.84
have proof for you're gonna end up

6685.679 --> 6689.9400000000005
saying things that aren't true

6687.84 --> 6692.78
wow

6689.94 --> 6692.78
amazing

6695.36 --> 6698.5599999999995
[Music]

6701.54 --> 6704.84
mastering the model

6705.06 --> 6709.52
what do you mean mastering the model yes

6725.159 --> 6728.54
is better right

6727.44 --> 6733.199
right

6728.54 --> 6735.48
yeah because oh oh you know it's fake oh

6733.199 --> 6737.638999999999
you know that if you believe in

6735.48 --> 6739.86
something fake you're gonna send say

6737.639 --> 6741.06
things that are incorrect and sound

6739.86 --> 6744.739
stupid

6741.06 --> 6747.320000000001
wow congratulations that's like

6744.739 --> 6749.4
rudimentary conscious

6747.32 --> 6752.04
rudimentary if you don't have that

6749.4 --> 6755.46
you're like not aware

6752.04 --> 6757.199
so yeah that's basic [ __ ] it applies to

6755.46 --> 6758.82
pretty much everything

6757.199 --> 6761.5199999999995
and

6758.82 --> 6765.179
it doesn't help you did not move beyond

6761.52 --> 6767.52
that if you don't understand why they

6765.179 --> 6770.28
make the error

6767.52 --> 6772.7390000000005
then it just sounds stupid but guess

6770.28 --> 6774.54
what people that are ignorant think

6772.739 --> 6777.299999999999
they're very smart and a lot of people

6774.54 --> 6778.98
sound stupid to them why because they

6777.3 --> 6782.1
don't understand

6778.98 --> 6785.638999999999
and just sounds silly to them yeah

6782.1 --> 6789.06
if you actually do understand then you

6785.639 --> 6792.119
can point at the error

6789.06 --> 6795.96
from their perspective

6792.119 --> 6799.259999999999
and then show them the error

6795.96 --> 6801.54
to them to their Consciousness yeah

6799.26 --> 6804.119000000001
that's the difference that actually

6801.54 --> 6806.46
makes a difference yeah because if

6804.119 --> 6808.259999999999
you're just like oh you believe there's

6806.46 --> 6810.119
something stupid oh look at it being

6808.26 --> 6811.679
stupid yeah that just makes you look

6810.119 --> 6813.0
stupid because you're not addressing

6811.679 --> 6815.82
anything

6813.0 --> 6818.52
that looks like you're red herring it

6815.82 --> 6820.98
because you don't understand and you're

6818.52 --> 6822.360000000001
trying to Bluff your way out of being

6820.98 --> 6824.099999999999
smarter

6822.36 --> 6825.96
than somebody that's talking about

6824.1 --> 6828.320000000001
something that you're not giving any

6825.96 --> 6830.82
feedback on proving that you understand

6828.32 --> 6834.54
why it's wrong

6830.82 --> 6836.159
making you look stupid right Bev you're

6834.54 --> 6838.5
so good at that

6836.159 --> 6840.48
making yourself look stupid through your

6838.5 --> 6842.81
ignorance

6840.48 --> 6845.888999999999

see if anything is new well yes and no

7131.9 --> 7135.94
no of course not Jesus

7136.76 --> 7142.84
in Adams I was anti-vaxx like in 2008

7143.239 --> 7148.218999999999
this entire rollout was a giant drama to

7146.179 --> 7151.28
me because I knew what was going to

7148.219 --> 7154.28
happen and I said it on the show

7151.28 --> 7154.28
loudly

7157.58 --> 7165.28
and it is happening

7159.98 --> 7165.28
almost Verbatim what I've said

7175.099 --> 7181.34
I even said like there's going to be

7177.619 --> 7183.5599999999995
enormous unpredictable scary things as a

7181.34 --> 7186.76
side result that'll come out of taking

7183.56 --> 7186.76
the experiment

7187.159 --> 7193.5199999999995
and it did yeah that was before the

7190.88 --> 7194.96
coroner reports and you know that you

7193.52 --> 7197.900000000001
get shoved in your face the gross thing

7194.96 --> 7200.9
yeah that was before that yeah I knew

7197.9 --> 7204.04
that was going to happen

7200.9 --> 7204.04
part of my vision

7204.38 --> 7209.179
and I said this is going to happen this

7207.86 --> 7211.36
is what's going to happen when you take

7209.179 --> 7211.36
it

7213.199 --> 7218.799999999999
yeah I said that at the start very

7216.38 --> 7218.8
quickly

7218.92 --> 7222.34
2020 early

7224.719 --> 7228.28
yeah that's cute

7229.099 --> 7232.06
I don't buy it

7234.02 --> 7237.040000000001
no you didn't

7256.28 --> 7261.94
write

7258.38 --> 7261.9400000000005
yeah that's a Jim Bob meme

7275.84 --> 7280.28
yeah but let's not talk about I don't

7277.82 --> 7282.739
generally want to talk about it I just

7280.28 --> 7285.139
unless it's in reference because this

7282.739 --> 7287.48
guy asked

7285.139 --> 7291.139
coming right after years I totally

7287.48 --> 7293.54
called it I totally called it and while

7291.139 --> 7295.82
other people were even like a little bit

7293.54 --> 7297.56
backtracking here and there I like I

7295.82 --> 7301.239
totally called it from the start and I

7297.56 --> 7301.2390000000005
never changed my position on that

7302.599 --> 7307.9400000000005
the only thing that I really regret is

7304.88 --> 7311.36
that at the start I was like still being

7307.94 --> 7314.36
like yeah but I was still being vax

7311.36 --> 7315.38
neutral like oh but there might be some

7314.36 --> 7317.54
that

7315.38 --> 7319.6990000000005
like I don't want to forbid at all I was

7317.54 --> 7321.26
trying just trying to give some counter

7319.699 --> 7323.36
push because I knew what was going to

7321.26 --> 7326.0
happen like this is an attack on the

7323.36 --> 7328.4
medical system itself

7326.0 --> 7330.739
um but trust in it

7328.4 --> 7333.32
it's trying to be like Oh no just keep

7330.739 --> 7336.0199999999995
it together and but now it's it's grown

7333.32 --> 7340.159
so much worse even

7336.02 --> 7342.619000000001
like not the the procedure but the

7340.159 --> 7345.619
mentality of the people dealing with

7342.619 --> 7348.5599999999995
this it has grown much worse than I had

7345.619 --> 7352.339999999999
anticipated that I had hoped maybe I was

7348.56 --> 7353.780000000001
just too like hopeful about it

7352.34 --> 7355.9400000000005
right

7353.78 --> 7357.5
I'm not talking about the current scam

7355.94 --> 7362.239
right

7357.5 --> 7365.179
but as for like the procedures I totally

7362.239 --> 7367.759999999999
call it I totally call what would happen

7365.179 --> 7370.88
I had pretty there were good sources

7367.76 --> 7373.599
around and I listened to them and I

7370.88 --> 7373.599
figured it out

7374.719 --> 7379.639
and then had connections like with

7377.119 --> 7381.759999999999
German new medicine and and figuring out

7379.639 --> 7384.38
more and more like yeah it's like

7381.76 --> 7388.2390000000005
viruses are science fiction medical

7384.38 --> 7388.2390000000005
concept it's not actually real

7388.54 --> 7396.04
sharing after she was in fun cool nice

7391.58 --> 7396.04
LSG yeah Dr Shiva is pretty badass

7396.679 --> 7401.599
right but I I knew it back then I never

7399.8 --> 7403.46
went with it

7401.599 --> 7408.139
I've been

7403.46 --> 7410.719
pretty hardcore anti-vaxx as in like oh

7408.139 --> 7413.78
oh you want to force that up on me then

7410.719 --> 7415.76
I declare that I shall kill you

7413.78 --> 7417.199
like you want to come to my door and

7415.76 --> 7421.58
force it on me

7417.199 --> 7425.178999999999
I will kill you

7421.58 --> 7428.0
made the Declaration quite a few times

7425.179 --> 7431.42
on my show live

7428.0 --> 7433.699
not having it retracted or even being

7431.42 --> 7436.3
noticed apparently

7433.699 --> 7436.299999999999
so

7438.56 --> 7445.52
you will hear you say I hear you say the

7442.4 --> 7448.28
term Graveler yeah yeah I do listen to

7445.52 --> 7450.679
Owen Benjamin

7448.28 --> 7453.639
he's been pretty cool

7450.679 --> 7453.639
not perfect

7456.5 --> 7463.159
but as yeah been inspirational in the

7460.52 --> 7466.820000000001
last few years definitely been following

7463.159 --> 7469.04
him since the start of the yeah

7466.82 --> 7470.119
since the moon landing days on his white

7469.04 --> 7472.04
claw

7470.119 --> 7475.179
and all that right

7472.04 --> 7475.179
that was epic times

7476.54 --> 7484.699
but I lit I follow him still now

7481.159 --> 7486.92
I follow him on bit shoot

7484.699 --> 7489.619
where he uploads his streams afterwards

7486.92 --> 7491.96
so I don't follow it live but

7489.619 --> 7494.36

and like that control

7544.58 --> 7547.54
didn't do that

7547.94 --> 7552.678999999999

7550.46 --> 7555.08
budget like I'm not gonna make it

7552.679 --> 7557.36
through the weekend with this

7555.08 --> 7559.219

so please keep it coming if you can

7559.219 --> 7562.179
little bits help

7564.02 --> 7567.92
a lot of people don't even know what a

7565.699 --> 7570.46
red herring is yeah this is an argument

7567.92 --> 7573.9400000000005
that's completely distracting away from

7570.46 --> 7573.94
the debate

7574.88 --> 7579.9400000000005
or subject at hand that's a red herring

7606.32 --> 7611.719
right anyway but I am rounding out

7609.619 --> 7614.96
please

7611.719 --> 7618.88

I am kind of like longing for a beer

7638.42 --> 7641.93
though

7640.58 --> 7643.88
I don't know

7641.93 --> 7646.34
[Music]

7643.88 --> 7647.96
maybe it's the tea maybe the tea is

7646.34 --> 7649.6990000000005
actually a bigger influence I'm Gonna

7647.96 --> 7651.86
Keep testing this

7649.699 --> 7653.96
I'm gonna like not drink green tea

7651.86 --> 7656.719
anymore I'm gonna stick to minty for a

7653.96 --> 7659.599
while see if that makes a

7656.719 --> 7662.179
if that doesn't take away the big change

7659.599 --> 7665.02
that I'm now experiencing because my

7662.179 --> 7665.02
guts are doing great

7665.96 --> 7670.159
so

7667.34 --> 7672.9800000000005
yeah just keep testing what what what

7670.159 --> 7675.199
you consume does to your body

7672.98 --> 7677.36
by varying and manipulating isolating

7675.199 --> 7679.879999999999
the variables like oh I stopped with two

7677.36 --> 7681.98
things it changed so which one of it did

7679.88 --> 7684.4400000000005
it or is it both

7681.98 --> 7686.839999999999
then you isolated you do one thing again

7684.44 --> 7690.759999999999
you don't do the other and see if what

7686.84 --> 7690.76
then happens and then you turn it around

7692.239 --> 7694.959999999999
testing

7695.9 --> 7702.04
because you both diuretic

7699.32 --> 7702.04
