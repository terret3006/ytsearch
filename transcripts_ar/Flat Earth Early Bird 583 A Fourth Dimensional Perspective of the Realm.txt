join button they'll be much appreciated

64.19 --> 71.99
so yeah today let us kind of turn around

68.92 --> 74.72
so i'm since a long time wearing a

71.99 --> 84.05
sweater again because it it really

74.72 --> 86.45
freshened up its has been cloudy just a

84.05 --> 89.99
little bit rainy but it's mostly just a

86.45 --> 94.60000000000001
lot fresher and yeah it's not moist by

89.99 --> 98.66
the way but it is just a lot fresher so

94.6 --> 106.33
it's not bad to have a bit of a fresh

98.66 --> 111.13
day in between yeah

106.33 --> 115.74
right so let's see you isn't chat yeah I

111.13 --> 118.21
even got my ear on the back there so

115.74 --> 119.94999999999999
right there were some people in earlier

118.21 --> 122.61999999999999
but I couldn't see them anymore because

119.95 --> 126.82000000000001
my chat crashed so as far as I know

122.62 --> 129.63
Peter Harrington was first Steve Amanda

126.82 --> 135.42
young Obama cool

129.63 --> 148.14
Robin Stanley Ryan artherton Tom Parker

135.42 --> 148.14
is very bear Obama cool Steve

150.75 --> 158.94
thank ya good to see you all so yeah

157.29 --> 163.16
what did you guys think about my hangout

158.94 --> 167.64
yesterday with good service

163.16 --> 170.57999999999998
yeah I haven't watched it back yet that

167.64 --> 177.6
didn't get to that yet but yeah what's

170.58 --> 180.33
pretty intense I thought yeah Missouri

177.6 --> 183.87
Bear I just I just reported the weather

180.33 --> 186.69000000000003
and it's it's fresher so it's supposed

183.87 --> 190.8
to be around like 20 degrees Celsius or

186.69 --> 194.15
something so it's not really cold it's

190.8 --> 194.15
just not very warm

198.09 --> 208.38
and there's not a lot of Sun coming

199.89 --> 212.19
through anyway yeah yeah I thought

208.38 --> 215.16
yesterday show was really really go at

212.19 --> 217.4
it I think like we were like getting in

215.16 --> 219.599
the mood almost where or what in the

217.4 --> 222.93
energy level what we were starting to

219.599 --> 227.459
interrupt one another so that that was a

222.93 --> 231.239
little bit tough get swings like that

227.459 --> 232.769
every year it's no well I don't know

231.239 --> 241.85
misery berry with the weather goes

232.769 --> 241.85
around all the time here so yeah

246.04 --> 252.969
it switches around a lot that's what I'm

249.01 --> 256.5
used to in the Netherlands I'm surprised

252.969 --> 261.19
there has been such a long period of eat

256.5 --> 261.82
to begin that that's not very that's not

261.19 --> 266.86
normal

261.82 --> 269.05
or weld normal it's something you

266.86 --> 272.13
wouldn't necessarily expect here in the

269.05 --> 272.13
Netherlands anyway

282.25 --> 291.07
oh yeah right that was a little weird

287.38 --> 294.90999999999997
yesterday on D life the home Benjamin

291.07 --> 296.88
and yeah my subscription had run out and

294.91 --> 299.07000000000005
that was already yesterday right I

296.88 --> 301.75
didn't even bring it up yesterday

299.07 --> 306.43
alright it was already the day before

301.75 --> 308.62
that so Saturday but yeah yesterday I I

306.43 --> 310.74
was just hanging around I I did have a

308.62 --> 312.88
lot of lemon saved up for this occasion

310.74 --> 314.08
because it's still a way to communicate

312.88 --> 316.54
that I'm there

314.08 --> 319.15
somebody can click on it otherwise she

316.54 --> 323.05
just yeah can't do anything you can show

319.15 --> 325.98999999999995
yourself so good old friend Julia

323.05 --> 328.84000000000003
Bennett Julie Bennett no she's been on

325.99 --> 332.8
the show even she was she hangs around a

328.84 --> 334.71999999999997
lot there over at the bears and she gave

332.8 --> 338.05
me a subscription so I was like yeah

334.72 --> 342.78000000000003
awesome cool I mean like Hello Barriss

338.05 --> 346.75
it's like you're not subscribed okay

342.78 --> 349.69
refresh you are not subscribed you're

346.75 --> 351.88
not subscribed it's like what the [ __ ] I

349.69 --> 353.53
was like fooling around for like it 15

351.88 --> 356.59
minutes and it just wouldn't let a

353.53 --> 359.44
single sentence through but then at some

356.59 --> 362.02
point it did and then I had to wait like

359.44 --> 365.11
another 15 minutes before it would allow

362.02 --> 368.5
me to put down a sentence again that was

365.11 --> 370.12
just really weird people who were like

368.5 --> 372.07
telling me I just refreshed just

370.12 --> 374.53000000000003
refreshed but it was like taking a long

372.07 --> 377.34999999999997
time and then eventually at the end of

374.53 --> 379.05999999999995
it it whatever that was

377.35 --> 383.97
seem to have been broken because

379.06 --> 383.97
certainly I could just type normal there

384.419 --> 390.84
these little things and they it really

387.91 --> 390.84000000000003
pissed me off because

391.0 --> 396.73
just kind of engaged really enthusiastic

394.9 --> 398.65
and you think oh yeah I got a

396.73 --> 404.23
subscription I can finally type again to

398.65 --> 407.14
say hello and then it's cut off but

404.23 --> 409.42
anyway I have the subscription again and

407.14 --> 413.16999999999996
we'll see if that happens again I hope

409.42 --> 422.19
not it was very annoying no idea why

413.17 --> 422.19
that was happening hey [ __ ]

423.51 --> 429.78999999999996
yes dank yeah Julie Bennett is a great

426.13 --> 436.18
support then she hangs a lot around in a

429.79 --> 440.88
lot of places in chess you membership

436.18 --> 440.88
avatar did you

442.889 --> 451.789
all right because because it's one month

445.53 --> 451.789
then it migrates right that makes sense

452.71 --> 458.63899999999995
yeah so a lot of the the first people

455.5 --> 461.65
that became members now their icon has

458.639 --> 464.05
has shifted because of the mountain one

461.65 --> 466.59999999999997
month membership yeah that's gonna shift

464.05 --> 469.419
more it technically doesn't make any

466.6 --> 470.91900000000004
sense it's not exactly what I wanted it

469.419 --> 473.85999999999996
but that's how it works

470.919 --> 476.919
so yeah you got four pictures and you'll

473.86 --> 480.09000000000003
end up with it with the Arch Druid

476.919 --> 483.09
picture I guess

480.09 --> 483.09
anyway

488.74 --> 492.509
let's see what are you guys talking

490.479 --> 492.50899999999996
about

494.889 --> 502.659
all right yeah Robert Stanley equites

498.34 --> 505.04999999999995
Irvin is is either great sport and I

502.659 --> 511.9
feel sometimes I get a bit rough on him

505.05 --> 515.349
because I don't know he just is that I

511.9 --> 517.63
get the feeling he gets swept away by

515.349 --> 520.1800000000001
his own feelings a lot that he gets

517.63 --> 522.669
distracted by them and it kind of

520.18 --> 524.56
worries me and then I hear from him well

522.669 --> 527.8
as it was kind of put down that he had

524.56 --> 530.5
this stomach problem for like half a

527.8 --> 534.91
year and like while he was being

530.5 --> 538.63
preoccupied with things in that half a

534.91 --> 542.23
year he until told nobody and that

538.63 --> 547.24
worries me this is like escapist

542.23 --> 549.1
behavior anyway but yeah I care for a

547.24 --> 552.5790000000001
good servant he's been a real great

549.1 --> 558.6700000000001
sport and yeah he's just a very good guy

552.579 --> 565.0889999999999
he has his own past and I said like deal

558.67 --> 567.399
with yeah I wouldn't want to see that go

565.089 --> 570.3100000000001
wrong so yeah I gave him some advice

567.399 --> 574.42
about the apple vinegar and I think he's

570.31 --> 577.05
taking it hope that helps because it was

574.42 --> 580.05
already so progressed the situation

577.05 --> 580.05
anyway

586.55 --> 592.06
yeah Robin Stanley carrying what the

589.399 --> 592.06
souls of others

597.8 --> 606.02
the well like I know it's very easy to

602.03 --> 611.3
know that he is driven only by goodwill

606.02 --> 616.4499999999999
as it were but that doesn't mean that he

611.3 --> 619.8499999999999
can't fumble with that still and yeah

616.45 --> 624.32
trying to help prevent that for him yeah

619.85 --> 632.8100000000001
but yeah everyone should want that with

624.32 --> 635.48
everyone else pretty much anyway yeah

632.81 --> 638.4799999999999
good servant I forgot to even share his

635.48 --> 639.83
channel and everything so yeah if you

638.48 --> 641.24
haven't already subscribed to good

639.83 --> 647.0600000000001
servant he has a channel and he does

641.24 --> 649.88
regular shows he's always kind of ready

647.06 --> 652.9599999999999
for just an interview one-on-one or with

649.88 --> 652.96
a with a body there

661.2 --> 673.5
all right any reflections upon the

670.14 --> 675.18
things that I've said also because I

673.5 --> 680.16
think I put down some pretty heavy stuff

675.18 --> 683.79
there like in response it's almost like

680.16 --> 687.7199999999999
because he was there he he fired me up a

683.79 --> 692.3399999999999
little bit more - yeah and then kind of

687.72 --> 693.78
big ideas popped in there again you know

692.34 --> 696.3000000000001
about the whole fourth dimensional

693.78 --> 698.1
concept although it is absolutely a a

696.3 --> 700.3499999999999
thought experiment

698.1 --> 705.57
you know it's yeah how do you begin to

700.35 --> 708.21
prove that it is very conceptually but

705.57 --> 711.5400000000001
to me like that's the only way it makes

708.21 --> 715.5600000000001
sense in my mind to kind of justify why

711.54 --> 721.92
we see these non-local heavenly lights

715.56 --> 724.4399999999999
as specific angular angular relations to

721.92 --> 725.8499999999999
the observer and always out a distance

724.44 --> 729.87
and then yeah

725.85 --> 734.07
how does that make any sense with all

729.87 --> 736.5
the sightings well then I attempted to

734.07 --> 739.47
basically create a another dimension

736.5 --> 742.38
through that is basically just parallel

739.47 --> 745.0500000000001
to this one and that would be the fourth

742.38 --> 749.67
dimension in which those things couldn't

745.05 --> 752.2199999999999
be kind of as if they were physically

749.67 --> 753.75
literally there but you'd have to be in

752.22 --> 755.85
the fourth dimension to be able to

753.75 --> 757.62
actually get a proximity otherwise they

755.85 --> 760.49
will be eternally out of reach anyway

757.62 --> 762.9
that was a concept that I put down again

760.49 --> 764.61
first few times when I put it up there

762.9 --> 766.35
at the Flat Earth debates and other

764.61 --> 770.01
places people were like what other

766.35 --> 772.77
dimensions and then yeah people back

770.01 --> 774.93
then work very easily taking on new

772.77 --> 776.4
concepts and then trying to craft it

774.93 --> 778.5
into what they were doing and they're

776.4 --> 782.97
like oh yeah maybe it's this dimension

778.5 --> 787.77
or that or parallel universe or math or

782.97 --> 791.24
anything and now I think that yeah these

787.77 --> 796.41
type of ideas are a little bit

791.24 --> 798.84
more scrutinized now after everything

796.41 --> 800.9699999999999
that's that's happened and all the

798.84 --> 810.2900000000001
research that has been done over the

800.97 --> 810.2900000000001
years by everyone huh what's this

822.84 --> 829.9100000000001
all right well Missouri bear who knows

827.18 --> 832.56
Ralph it's better than dimension

829.91 --> 840.15
different realms of reality no no a

832.56 --> 843.03
realm is basically a Content like a

840.15 --> 848.06
realm in my view is basically a

843.03 --> 851.6999999999999
container but yeah it could be also

848.06 --> 854.6099999999999
designated as segments of what is in the

851.7 --> 858.33
container separated by in habitable

854.61 --> 860.61
zones with habitable zones basically at

858.33 --> 869.4000000000001
the habitable zones being at the center

860.61 --> 871.2
of these realms segments but yeah the

869.4 --> 874.05
dimensions think that's that's something

871.2 --> 880.47
else that's more about conceptual

874.05 --> 884.0999999999999
speciality and just but yeah who knows

880.47 --> 885.8100000000001
in a way you if you're just gonna play

884.1 --> 887.9300000000001
around with that and start out doing

885.81 --> 892.1099999999999
that then you could even consider

887.93 --> 894.92
consider it's pretty freaky that maybe

892.11 --> 897.59
what we're living in right here this

894.92 --> 903.12
this realm the 3d realm

897.59 --> 908.27
maybe that is kind of like a similar

903.12 --> 912.51
Tori real an altered version of the

908.27 --> 915.42
actual realm which would be then in the

912.51 --> 919.53
fourth dimension so almost like there's

915.42 --> 922.8299999999999
an artificial simulation going on in the

919.53 --> 928.88
real physical realm of the physical

922.83 --> 928.88
realm itself yeah yep

932.5 --> 936.84
does that make any sense to you guys

944.44 --> 953.4100000000001
like for example that the yeah let's

950.769 --> 955.66
presuppose for for a moment that the

953.41 --> 959.649
fourth dimension is actually the real

955.66 --> 963.55
the normal state of reality right and

959.649 --> 966.519
that in that state things are just

963.55 --> 969.189
different like things are more easily

966.519 --> 975.61
malleable for example it's more easy to

969.189 --> 978.25
make things or like maybe there is some

975.61 --> 981.04
weird thing where that light is actually

978.25 --> 983.29
some kind of matter there like things

981.04 --> 986.709
might actually completely work different

983.29 --> 990.79
that this is scientific but trying to

986.709 --> 995.1099999999999
describe that and then in that real

990.79 --> 999.37
realm state maybe it's just arranged

995.11 --> 1004.0790000000001
like almost like a field generator to

999.37 --> 1008.579
kind of alter sort in certain physical

1004.079 --> 1013.0089999999999
aspects or then basically turn them to

1008.579 --> 1016.439
create the setting that is then more

1013.009 --> 1018.9300000000001
solidified less malleable a form of

1016.439 --> 1022.139
reality which would be our 3d realm and

1018.93 --> 1026.6989999999998
it may even include the looping factors

1022.139 --> 1028.11
as a default you know weird or even if

1026.699 --> 1030.569
you consider this from a

1028.11 --> 1032.37
fourth-dimensional perspective in which

1030.569 --> 1036.049
this realm experience would be a

1032.37 --> 1038.789
simulation maybe it's even alterable

1036.049 --> 1040.559
maybe it's literally we're living in the

1038.789 --> 1043.11
cemetery version and the same military

1040.559 --> 1047.3999999999999
version could be adapted that maybe it

1043.11 --> 1053.34
was indeed once a freaking bubble dome

1047.4 --> 1057.419
and then a guy called our win in a very

1053.34 --> 1059.1
weird place in his life somehow stumbled

1057.419 --> 1061.95
into this dimension and then told

1059.1 --> 1063.8999999999999
everybody but yeah wouldn't it be easier

1061.95 --> 1065.789
and more mystical to contain it all

1063.9 --> 1068.3400000000001
within a looping realm with since we

1065.789 --> 1071.1299999999999
were simulating it anyway why wouldn't

1068.34 --> 1073.549
we do it it would be more confusing more

1071.13 --> 1077.0100000000002
of a mystery to figure it out and that

1073.549 --> 1080.75
may be said ok right ok in the next

1077.01 --> 1080.75
transition we're actually doing that

1082.7 --> 1090.8300000000002
yeah ok but this is basically already

1087.84 --> 1094.1399999999999
deep over heels head over heels into

1090.83 --> 1096.24
simulation theory because that would not

1094.14 --> 1100.409
make the realm semi Latorre it would

1096.24 --> 1103.83
make it a simulation in the real similar

1100.409 --> 1106.13
Tori natured physical over realm in the

1103.83 --> 1110.399
4th dimension I don't know man

1106.13 --> 1113.8500000000001
well I do but I know it must sound kind

1110.399 --> 1115.6789999999999
of weird I don't know if you guys are

1113.85 --> 1117.34
even listening at this point seem to be

1115.679 --> 1120.4
talking about other stuff

1117.34 --> 1120.3999999999999
[Music]

1123.31 --> 1127.619
[Music]

1132.29 --> 1138.74
here are 2019 hello who's that

1149.36 --> 1156.6999999999998
feedback anyone fourth dimension in

1153.11 --> 1160.309
which the 3d realm would be an alterable

1156.7 --> 1163.8690000000001
simulation to make the actual fourth

1160.309 --> 1172.789
dimensional malleable reality into more

1163.869 --> 1175.629
preset fixed state anyone or is it too

1172.789 --> 1175.629
early for you guys

1184.2 --> 1194.19
you know I could I could show you

1190.529 --> 1196.08
something that you could imagine what it

1194.19 --> 1200.669
would be like from a fourth-dimensional

1196.08 --> 1202.9089999999999
perspective to overlook our realm about

1200.669 --> 1202.909
that

1213.82 --> 1219.6599999999999
to find it first

1216.79 --> 1219.6599999999999
where is it

1223.74 --> 1228.47
oh can I show this misters work

1242.96 --> 1247.8400000000001
let's see yeah that might work

1249.33 --> 1251.96
yep

1259.3 --> 1266.08
right so this is how you could

1264.03 --> 1268.95
potentially see it from a

1266.08 --> 1268.9499999999998
fourth-dimensional perspective

1298.5 --> 1305.309
is that a dome you see well not

1302.85 --> 1308.539
literally if you are looking more

1305.309 --> 1311.25
careful it's actually rather the

1308.539 --> 1313.62
fourth-dimensional part of the

1311.25 --> 1317.49
simulation which would be the globe of

1313.62 --> 1321.4499999999998
the heavens surrounding the relative

1317.49 --> 1324.049
center which is observer based and you

1321.45 --> 1328.6200000000001
could basically scroll around the realm

1324.049 --> 1333.33
within that thing and as you scroll the

1328.62 --> 1335.9399999999998
land on the platform then so does the

1333.33 --> 1338.03
globe of the heaven star system rotate

1335.94 --> 1341.14
with it

1338.03 --> 1341.1399999999999
[Music]

1348.67 --> 1357.97
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about it's a

1354.82 --> 1359.62
stupid troll yeah I don't know what it

1357.97 --> 1362.26
is man but there's some real nasty

1359.62 --> 1364.77
trolls going around again they're making

1362.26 --> 1367.39
their rounds they have to basically I

1364.77 --> 1371.11
don't know double down on their religion

1367.39 --> 1373.69
to spread misery in order to help the

1371.11 --> 1378.82
economy or something whatever drives

1373.69 --> 1381.93
these freaks I don't know what it is but

1378.82 --> 1381.9299999999998
yeah he's out here

1386.58 --> 1389.3
right

1404.65 --> 1408.0
it's just a troll

1415.31 --> 1419.0
now I've been getting some people

1416.96 --> 1420.65
complaining to me and then me you and

1419.0 --> 1423.82
ban me and I'm like I don't even know

1420.65 --> 1426.5
who the [ __ ] you are and why why would I

1423.82 --> 1428.0
why would I am ban you if I don't even

1426.5 --> 1429.68
know what you are and I'll probably

1428.0 --> 1430.48
banned you because you acted like an

1429.68 --> 1435.0800000000002
idiot

1430.48 --> 1438.5
no this is there's plenty of that as

1435.08 --> 1440.24
well yeah I'm okay right now certain I'm

1438.5 --> 1442.82
doing great I'm kind of disappointed

1440.24 --> 1445.4
though that been talking for about a

1442.82 --> 1450.3799999999999
pretty intense concept again for like 15

1445.4 --> 1451.97
minutes now without a single response to

1450.38 --> 1453.98
what I'm talking about in jet

1451.97 --> 1461.69
everybody's constantly talking about

1453.98 --> 1464.75
other [ __ ] it just makes me wonder like

1461.69 --> 1466.3400000000001
wow I guess that I'm just blah blah blah

1464.75 --> 1469.76
blah it's just blah blah blah blah blah

1466.34 --> 1473.9599999999998
to people because they can't even give

1469.76 --> 1477.14
back some kind of response and I'm

1473.96 --> 1479.1100000000001
talking about you guys in my chat my

1477.14 --> 1482.1100000000001
subscribers that come here every day

1479.11 --> 1482.11
like

1486.46 --> 1490.49
the baton who gives a [ __ ] about the

1488.9 --> 1492.6200000000001
Bening I just described a

1490.49 --> 1498.79
fourth-dimensional perspective on

1492.62 --> 1498.79
reality isn't that interesting

1505.7 --> 1509.959
it makes your head spin about the fourth

1507.619 --> 1513.289
dimension thank you well at least you

1509.959 --> 1518.059
told me so put the drawing back up okay

1513.289 --> 1520.009
and then it's look basically all my

1518.059 --> 1524.359
drawings of the realm could be

1520.009 --> 1526.369
considered to be that could be fourth

1524.359 --> 1537.32
dimensional it's like how else are we

1526.369 --> 1539.119
going to even try to show that right

1537.32 --> 1542.4089999999999
this is by the way also with my drawing

1539.119 --> 1542.4089999999999
of space city in there

1548.46 --> 1555.94
which would be I don't know what that

1552.79 --> 1557.98
was if that's some like weird science

1555.94 --> 1560.29
fiction thing that I came up with or

1557.98 --> 1563.52
that it's potentially a real thing in

1560.29 --> 1568.84
the future was basically consistent of a

1563.52 --> 1570.69
floating city at the higher regions of

1568.84 --> 1577.0
the realm

1570.69 --> 1579.8200000000002
so maybe closer to to the barrier the

1577.0 --> 1581.68
first barrier perhaps or maybe beyond

1579.82 --> 1583.12
maybe at some point this barrier will we

1581.68 --> 1587.5
turn off and you can actually move

1583.12 --> 1591.1899999999998
beyond and maybe at some point yeah the

1587.5 --> 1594.31
relative density equilibrium change or

1591.19 --> 1597.8200000000002
like the disequilibrium forces start to

1594.31 --> 1599.26
change at some altitude perhaps doesn't

1597.82 --> 1601.84
mean there's no empty the container but

1599.26 --> 1604.48
perhaps there could be things kind of

1601.84 --> 1606.4599999999998
like a floating city like almost like a

1604.48 --> 1607.9
Space Station but it's not a Space

1606.46 --> 1610.45
Station because it's still floating

1607.9 --> 1613.68
there could only be so many people on

1610.45 --> 1615.91
there and perhaps they would be

1613.68 --> 1617.74
electrostatically neutralized and that

1615.91 --> 1620.67
would only work for a certain period and

1617.74 --> 1623.44
you you can't have the device to do that

1620.67 --> 1628.2
in the station itself because it would

1623.44 --> 1628.2
be too heavy to keep up there etc etc

1631.77 --> 1639.01
Missouri Byrd now yeah that is my email

1634.12 --> 1641.37
- I do have email back and forth with

1639.01 --> 1641.37
some people

1652.07 --> 1658.95
mmm

1654.39 --> 1662.91
yes see because people don't get it this

1658.95 --> 1664.41
this drawing even this is not me saying

1662.91 --> 1667.8300000000002
like oh look at this

1664.41 --> 1669.75
this is little this is science oh yeah

1667.83 --> 1673.32
this is no that's not what I'm saying

1669.75 --> 1676.94
it's not not ever what I said now this

1673.32 --> 1682.1299999999999
is literally tapped from a vision that

1676.94 --> 1685.55
I've seen long ago and there's yeah

1682.13 --> 1685.5500000000002
totally surreal

1692.11 --> 1702.2199999999998
anyway I got more of these right away

1697.08 --> 1706.539
right let's put back the right segment

1702.22 --> 1708.669
of the rectangular looping from a side

1706.539 --> 1711.85
perspective outside of the loop of the

1708.669 --> 1713.019
realm so at that sense it would also be

1711.85 --> 1722.9699999999998
fourth dimension the fourth dimension

1713.019 --> 1727.57
there is no loop can't exist wait no

1722.97 --> 1733.2
this is my whole list of pictures and

1727.57 --> 1736.269
realm stuff yeah here's from a a tube

1733.2 --> 1742.929
projection from the inside from inside

1736.269 --> 1748.409
the realm at high up that's a more

1742.929 --> 1753.19
creative the Hat style projection weird

1748.409 --> 1756.0900000000001
right this is the real work ant equator

1753.19 --> 1756.0900000000001
equator drawing

1761.79 --> 1764.3899999999999
right

1771.72 --> 1775.72
oh yeah

1773.74 --> 1781.6200000000001
and this this is like one of the first

1775.72 --> 1785.32
wrongs I attempted for a a disk base

1781.62 --> 1788.4599999999998
projection where there would be more

1785.32 --> 1791.47
land segments and this would be how you

1788.46 --> 1795.25
then basically project that and that's

1791.47 --> 1798.52
the idea that like the outside of the

1795.25 --> 1802.26
Ring would literally fit inside of the

1798.52 --> 1804.8799999999999
inside of the next segment and that

1802.26 --> 1808.15
would keep on continuing so there would

1804.88 --> 1813.25
be roughly the same disk surface of land

1808.15 --> 1814.99
at every segment and then yeah if you

1813.25 --> 1816.7
would all take it spatially literally

1814.99 --> 1819.61
then there would be the same amount of

1816.7 --> 1823.89
land geometrically fitting within the

1819.61 --> 1827.1899999999998
circle of that hole and and that yeah

1823.89 --> 1829.929
but yeah then I figured out wait you

1827.19 --> 1833.41
could also just see it as a rectangular

1829.929 --> 1835.5400000000002
looping system and that might probably

1833.41 --> 1837.7
work a lot better even to try to

1835.54 --> 1840.33
represent that but this was a early

1837.7 --> 1840.3300000000002
attempt

1847.3 --> 1858.6399999999999
all right and of course from my very

1852.43 --> 1864.43
first hangout different ways of showing

1858.64 --> 1867.0400000000002
it square to rectangular area north he

1864.43 --> 1871.03
and that's basically when I still didn't

1867.04 --> 1877.27
figure out the loop concept this was

1871.03 --> 1879.46
still based on barriers but yeah back

1877.27 --> 1881.92
then I didn't really know as much about

1879.46 --> 1883.72
empiricism like yeah how what do I

1881.92 --> 1887.7
really know for sure I was just

1883.72 --> 1891.16
basically just playing with realms just

1887.7 --> 1893.47
yeah like building a barn you learn how

1891.16 --> 1895.23
to build a barn right well I I was

1893.47 --> 1900.22
trying to learn how to build a realm

1895.23 --> 1906.19
virtually like what what options could

1900.22 --> 1911.47
be there anyway it's interesting to to

1906.19 --> 1918.01
go through them again yeah he imagined

1911.47 --> 1920.46
my very first hangout I can barely

1918.01 --> 1920.46
believe it myself

1931.01 --> 1942.11
but if light in the room space it off

1936.33 --> 1942.11
and stays off what what does that mean

1949.4 --> 1956.48
nice drawings Wow there were sketches

1951.9 --> 1960.39
look I'm a sketcher I'm not much of a

1956.48 --> 1962.49
like a real artist that makes it look

1960.39 --> 1965.19
very real and stuff like a painter I

1962.49 --> 1969.06
never got that underneath never really I

1965.19 --> 1970.8300000000002
really tried and then what it became

1969.06 --> 1973.71
about more is just learning the

1970.83 --> 1975.0
impression ability using colors that is

1973.71 --> 1977.22
kind of what I learned out of painting

1975.0 --> 1979.68
not really to make things look

1977.22 --> 1982.6100000000001
absolutely realistic I just never really

1979.68 --> 1982.6100000000001
got it under the knee

1989.97 --> 1994.95
I don't know maybe fight at the

1992.28 --> 1996.3
opportunity to draw more naked models I

1994.95 --> 2002.24
probably would have made some more

1996.3 --> 2004.49
effort unless they were ugly that's

2002.24 --> 2011.81
silly I think we did actually draw a

2004.49 --> 2013.15
naked model at one point was that I said

2011.81 --> 2016.1499999999999
it's cool I think

2013.15 --> 2016.15
right

2021.73 --> 2027.22
can you draw like a five-year-old well I

2025.269 --> 2031.96
started drawing when I was five year old

2027.22 --> 2035.799
but you know what it started with space

2031.96 --> 2038.1390000000001
cities on the moon that's like my first

2035.799 --> 2043.4189999999999
freaking drunk oh yeah and Dragons I

2038.139 --> 2047.609
still have those just freakin building

2043.419 --> 2050.23
space cities all day like yeah and

2047.609 --> 2055.619
building it with Legos not too long

2050.23 --> 2055.619
after that or both

2063.419 --> 2070.95
and with space cities I mostly mean like

2065.879 --> 2072.99
the futurist type like buck Roger it was

2070.95 --> 2074.25
a lot also inspired by Buck Rogers by

2072.99 --> 2078.45
the way because they had like these

2074.25 --> 2081.089
painted back pictures and they were

2078.45 --> 2083.7599999999998
quite futuristic and beautiful at times

2081.089 --> 2085.95
I thought but they were like really

2083.76 --> 2089.039
painted but it was like really special

2085.95 --> 2091.4399999999996
and that kind of stuff impressed me just

2089.039 --> 2092.7000000000003
to no end I was obsessed with that [ __ ]

2091.44 --> 2097.68
when I was a very little kid I was like

2092.7 --> 2101.069
yeah the future well dude everybody with

2097.68 --> 2104.69
personal spacecrafts and [ __ ] yeah that

2101.069 --> 2104.69
that caught me very quick

2111.589 --> 2119.0589999999997
it's what a Mayo named Ellis what the

2118.099 --> 2130.449
hell is that

2119.059 --> 2130.449
Oh someone else's No

2133.27 --> 2136.17
not really

2139.16 --> 2144.17
but at the same time when I was figuring

2141.92 --> 2150.009
out like the holographic aspect of the

2144.17 --> 2150.009
Sun in that time I did also bump into

2150.46 --> 2157.64
yeah now square earth cosmology that

2153.769 --> 2159.6499999999996
channel he used to be free energy and he

2157.64 --> 2162.519
showed me something about the realm and

2159.65 --> 2166.13
he was basically the first to animate

2162.519 --> 2168.74
the concept of the loop which at first I

2166.13 --> 2169.549
didn't even understand what the hell

2168.74 --> 2171.2589999999996
that was

2169.549 --> 2175.7889999999998
I didn't understand what he was showing

2171.259 --> 2177.829
me I was just like what what is this

2175.789 --> 2181.5690000000004
fourth dimension about light and air

2177.829 --> 2184.549
that most remarkable thing was how he

2181.569 --> 2186.89
tried to model out in his animation how

2184.549 --> 2191.269
light works and what the Sun dad was

2186.89 --> 2193.5789999999997
like really well dude but yeah

2191.269 --> 2196.6699999999996
technically he basically has animated

2193.579 --> 2198.9500000000003
the concept of a loop the first it was

2196.67 --> 2200.299
because great animation skills or

2198.95 --> 2203.45
whoever does that for him

2200.299 --> 2207.92
yeah and I'm only catching up verbally

2203.45 --> 2211.279
but I am a progenitor of the rectangular

2207.92 --> 2217.94
looping model concept more than anyone

2211.279 --> 2219.41
out here on the internet I think there

2217.94 --> 2225.73
may be other people that are kind of

2219.41 --> 2225.73
like on that in their own way

2237.95 --> 2245.4199999999996
but yeah when I basically conceptualized

2242.119 --> 2248.96
the loop and I think that even I the

2245.42 --> 2256.78
moment I came on to that idea that was

2248.96 --> 2256.78
during during a show somewhere was it

2263.7 --> 2271.23
I just thought of it and then someone

2266.369 --> 2273.42
pointed me again to two free energies

2271.23 --> 2276.3
videos and just say like yeah that's

2273.42 --> 2280.109
like pac-man earth or something and he

2276.3 --> 2282.27
showed him again and I'm like what wait

2280.109 --> 2286.89
so that is what that's supposed to be

2282.27 --> 2290.28
and then I'm like okay I disagree this

2286.89 --> 2292.0789999999997
guy put like very adamantly put barriers

2290.28 --> 2293.369
at the north and the south and I'm like

2292.079 --> 2297.32
oh really

2293.369 --> 2297.32
what's your freakin evidence for that

2304.23 --> 2312.0
Thank You Guns of Navarone rmp I do my

2307.68 --> 2315.1189999999997
best I can get very interruptive at the

2312.0 --> 2317.76
Flat Earth debates as well try not to

2315.119 --> 2320.4900000000002
but yeah you got to give it to Nathan to

2317.76 --> 2324.0200000000004
that he's also like upping the quality a

2320.49 --> 2327.6899999999996
lot just the way he used words and the

2324.02 --> 2329.49
sheer amount of words the palette of it

2327.69 --> 2331.589
is just becoming fast sometimes I have

2329.49 --> 2334.89
to even have to look up a word that he

2331.589 --> 2337.109
says because I like I get it

2334.89 --> 2339.1189999999997
feeling wise but I don't technically

2337.109 --> 2344.88
know what that actually means they're

2339.119 --> 2349.19
like what but I do my best to basically

2344.88 --> 2349.19
follow suit and to improve as well

2359.33 --> 2364.5499999999997
thank you in the con Survivor I really

2362.24 --> 2367.31
appreciate that compliment thank you

2364.55 --> 2369.3100000000004
very much I do my best but sometimes a

2367.31 --> 2372.0499999999997
few it's not really enough though but

2369.31 --> 2375.07
yeah it's always good to hear it back

2372.05 --> 2379.01
from others that yeah like it is really

2375.07 --> 2381.23
good you know I sometimes just need

2379.01 --> 2385.3
somebody needs to tell me for me to

2381.23 --> 2385.3
believe that that it's actually real

2387.91 --> 2397.73
right oh yeah yesterday also that was

2391.4 --> 2400.25
quite late went over to am i UK I'm a

2397.73 --> 2402.05
UK's discord channel basically I'm an

2400.25 --> 2406.31
invite from sleeping warrior and I went

2402.05 --> 2409.46
in there and at first kind of got in the

2406.31 --> 2412.37
way because I was just being very are

2409.46 --> 2418.73
wind and I had a couple of beers behind

2412.37 --> 2422.69
me my teeth after the kita I had a few

2418.73 --> 2424.46
drinks right and sleeping warrior was

2422.69 --> 2426.17
trying to push me out of the way by

2424.46 --> 2427.55
shaming me like are you drinking you're

2426.17 --> 2430.2200000000003
doing or you drink you can get it like

2427.55 --> 2432.44
yeah duh what does that mean that I'm

2430.22 --> 2435.0499999999997
making no sense no I'm making a really

2432.44 --> 2439.9700000000003
concise point here stop telling me up

2435.05 --> 2441.2000000000003
drunk Tony but maybe I was kind of

2439.97 --> 2443.39
stealing his moment as well you know

2441.2 --> 2447.2599999999998
it's I am our winner after all it's

2443.39 --> 2450.44
can't help it yeah but I find it very

2447.26 --> 2451.5800000000004
annoying when people do that don't

2450.44 --> 2454.76
remind me please

2451.58 --> 2460.0299999999997
like I know okay I know I drink when I

2454.76 --> 2460.03
drink and yeah

2460.54 --> 2468.7599999999998
doesn't make me dumber it just makes my

2464.349 --> 2469.3900000000003
tongue roll a little less subtle octal

2468.76 --> 2473.92
akiza

2469.39 --> 2476.95
I accidentally translated that literally

2473.92 --> 2480.1800000000003
to English Roger and then it didn't work

2476.95 --> 2480.18
like wait now

2485.98 --> 2493.03
well okay look if you're having like a

2488.81 --> 2494.9
personal just a non-technical

2493.03 --> 2497.09
conversation then having drinks

2494.9 --> 2499.82
definitely makes things more fluid makes

2497.09 --> 2502.75
it easier like you'd have less you feel

2499.82 --> 2506.06
less barrier or less objection right but

2502.75 --> 2508.79
yeah when you're talking technicals what

2506.06 --> 2512.66
it does with me also is it it kind of

2508.79 --> 2516.59
like slows down my the focus of my scene

2512.66 --> 2520.31
my speech control okay so I become more

2516.59 --> 2526.4300000000003
stumbly typical but it doesn't take away

2520.31 --> 2528.79
my intellectual capacity at it and it

2526.43 --> 2532.6099999999997
makes me blurt out things quicker

2528.79 --> 2534.44
it makes me also object less to being a

2532.61 --> 2537.35
dick and interrupting people for example

2534.44 --> 2545.6
and then when I push it too far I do

2537.35 --> 2549.74
realize it in them I get crap okay but

2545.6 --> 2552.38
yeah and that happened a technical

2549.74 --> 2557.0
discussion about gravity bending a

2552.38 --> 2558.59
space-time was it yeah what else but

2557.0 --> 2564.41
there was a baller and he was like

2558.59 --> 2567.8500000000004
really being a real serious baller about

2564.41 --> 2571.0099999999998
it like it was like one of the last

2567.85 --> 2573.7999999999997
hours of the day for me and so I kind of

2571.01 --> 2578.5
forgot what it was in content but maybe

2573.8 --> 2581.4500000000003
if sleeping warrior shows up in my chat

2578.5 --> 2583.13
then he could tell me or it might be

2581.45 --> 2586.1899999999996
he's already in the Flat Earth debate

2583.13 --> 2589.4900000000002
pre-show and the Neil probably remind me

2586.19 --> 2591.86
and every what about how Harun was drunk

2589.49 --> 2594.4399999999996
on it because he is sleeping warrior and

2591.86 --> 2598.4500000000003
once he starts to do that he keeps on

2594.44 --> 2598.4500000000003
doing that so goodie

2599.8 --> 2605.77
hey welcome back Amanda young yeah you

2603.17 --> 2605.77
missed everything

2622.0 --> 2632.29
Thank You guns I've never on RMP I

2624.53 --> 2632.2900000000004
appreciate that ad yeah

2633.42 --> 2644.94
I'm yeah I know I'm good at it it's not

2637.98 --> 2647.249
perfect I'd like to really speak it

2644.94 --> 2651.41
perfectly requires a lot of focus and

2647.249 --> 2654.839
somewhat or it requires some preparation

2651.41 --> 2658.799
like mentally to do it really perfectly

2654.839 --> 2662.489
so you got to really have a strong idea

2658.799 --> 2664.739
and then let it let it preset and then

2662.489 --> 2666.63
it can roll out perfectly and that works

2664.739 --> 2669.029
sometimes with me not always so

2666.63 --> 2670.4700000000003
sometimes I get a bit stumbly when I try

2669.029 --> 2672.96
to put down an idea at the debates

2670.47 --> 2676.6189999999997
because it basically got my turn too

2672.96 --> 2679.14
quickly it's weird because sometimes I

2676.619 --> 2681.239
try to push a point and then I don't get

2679.14 --> 2684.0589999999997
a chance right away but that actually

2681.239 --> 2685.859
gives me more inert time to prepare then

2684.059 --> 2688.71
if it takes too long then it waters down

2685.859 --> 2694.619
and I'll lose it lose that yeah there's

2688.71 --> 2699.079
no more place for it but yeah I have had

2694.619 --> 2703.349
a lot of speech training though as a kid

2699.079 --> 2706.98
because I used to mumble a lot not being

2703.349 --> 2709.4100000000003
verbal also out of like from a fear

2706.98 --> 2711.96
perspective like if people don't notice

2709.41 --> 2714.93
me then they're not a danger to me so

2711.96 --> 2716.9990000000003
kind of like mumbled and it was very bad

2714.93 --> 2719.819
habit somewhere parents were really like

2716.999 --> 2724.799
no you have to articulate and they put

2719.819 --> 2728.88
in a lot of personal work like outside

2724.799 --> 2731.099
of school to teach me how to speak my

2728.88 --> 2734.19
own language first and eventually also

2731.099 --> 2738.42
English I'm very thankful for that

2734.19 --> 2740.46
I hated it back then they were always

2738.42 --> 2742.619
like I could never just blurt out

2740.46 --> 2746.13
something like but I just want an easy

2742.619 --> 2749.789
speak blurt out the way that I want it

2746.13 --> 2752.549
and that's just stupid the one kids have

2749.789 --> 2754.5890000000004
it's stupid so I really glad they kind

2752.549 --> 2757.71
of grilled me and just forced me to do

2754.589 --> 2763.64
it right because yeah now I have pretty

2757.71 --> 2763.64
good English speech skills among others

2775.9 --> 2786.369
[Music]

2783.369 --> 2786.369
what

2786.79 --> 2794.08
Missouri bear really to destroy the

2791.26 --> 2796.23
English language was it founded for that

2794.08 --> 2798.85
now that doesn't make any sense

2796.23 --> 2801.19
what would make sense though is that

2798.85 --> 2804.37
they were at the time basically founded

2801.19 --> 2806.7000000000003
upon the separation with England so that

2804.37 --> 2809.95
early on choices to make language

2806.7 --> 2812.68
deviate away from it their language

2809.95 --> 2815.74
American deviate away from English would

2812.68 --> 2817.6299999999997
beat a typical thing to do back then

2815.74 --> 2821.14
that doesn't mean that it was designed

2817.63 --> 2827.59
specifically to destroy it that makes no

2821.14 --> 2833.25
sense I think yeah just leave it to two

2827.59 --> 2833.25
Marxist to do that that was much later

2848.08 --> 2851.17
[Music]

2862.95 --> 2867.02
most didn't want to leave the crown

2869.88 --> 2873.1400000000003
I don't know what that

2878.619 --> 2885.9100000000003
but yeah at the time it was basically

2882.119 --> 2889.6600000000003
the British Empire pretty big so and it

2885.91 --> 2891.069
was doing pretty well for an empire at

2889.66 --> 2894.5789999999997
the time so it's yeah not surprising

2891.069 --> 2898.869
that people are not enthusiastic to go

2894.579 --> 2911.8900000000003
at war with the big Empire when there is

2898.869 --> 2915.579
no big war yet so yeah of course 75 80

2911.89 --> 2918.489
percent didn't want to revolt well maybe

2915.579 --> 2920.9790000000003
they were not aiive

2918.489 --> 2923.079
I don't know man may your the American

2920.979 --> 2925.9199999999996
here I'll leave it to you I don't know

2923.079 --> 2925.92
if that's true

2942.95 --> 2948.74
but I think in general high percentage

2946.13 --> 2951.77
of people will being willing to revolt

2948.74 --> 2955.069
is a rare thing anyhow it's never that

2951.77 --> 2961.88
man that many especially if it's a

2955.069 --> 2964.25
really big country that's now I have

2961.88 --> 2966.46
ancestors in South Africa I don't think

2964.25 --> 2966.46
so

2972.869 --> 2981.9900000000002
not that I am aware of I don't think any

2979.079 --> 2987.2400000000002
of my ancestors of any relations South

2981.99 --> 2989.779
Africa like that nobody went there what

2987.24 --> 2989.779
I'm not sure

3021.73 --> 3032.29
okay there Missouri bear you're ready to

3027.8 --> 3032.29
to join their revolutionaries den

3043.099 --> 3046.9700000000003
Tom what

3066.58 --> 3069.71
[Music]

3073.24 --> 3080.3199999999997
ah well tiny Bombo

3076.21 --> 3082.39
if you don't understand how such a

3080.32 --> 3084.31
country can have such a big Emperor then

3082.39 --> 3087.0099999999998
Empire then you don't understand how

3084.31 --> 3092.38
they did it because they did it a lot

3087.01 --> 3097.57
through trade and education like and it

3092.38 --> 3099.73
also in good ways like Britain and of

3097.57 --> 3104.53
course there is always going to be like

3099.73 --> 3107.11
rights [ __ ] and for crimes but overall

3104.53 --> 3110.7000000000003
they had a lot of like constructive

3107.11 --> 3113.8
influence places that they colonized

3110.7 --> 3118.6299999999997
like they build stuff and they they

3113.8 --> 3122.1400000000003
created like paper foundations for

3118.63 --> 3125.23
proper management like proper management

3122.14 --> 3128.2599999999998
that was not as convoluted bureaucratic

3125.23 --> 3131.17
[ __ ] as it all is now but they just

3128.26 --> 3134.8900000000003
built a lot of modern they modernized a

3131.17 --> 3136.87
lot of stuff and that is what well what

3134.89 --> 3138.94
made them successful because then

3136.87 --> 3142.24
actually joining them would really

3138.94 --> 3143.71
benefit the locals in ways not everybody

3142.24 --> 3144.4599999999996
of course because that's that that's

3143.71 --> 3148.03
impossible

3144.46 --> 3153.07
and yeah the Dutch did it too but the

3148.03 --> 3154.9300000000003
Dutch have always avoided like after we

3153.07 --> 3157.51
kind of like really gutters our

3154.93 --> 3161.04
territories that we didn't really avoid

3157.51 --> 3161.0400000000004
war as much as possible

3164.4 --> 3170.7200000000003
I don't think the Netherlands has ever

3166.41 --> 3170.72
declared war officially on any country

3172.31 --> 3179.19
that I know of maybe there is an

3175.38 --> 3185.58
exception somewhere but yeah but Britain

3179.19 --> 3188.63
was more it was more about just yeah

3185.58 --> 3191.31
also the authority within the

3188.63 --> 3196.4300000000003
modernization so they would go to war

3191.31 --> 3196.43
over it oh yeah over details even

3199.58 --> 3205.46
England was really trying to dominate

3202.22 --> 3205.4599999999996
with it

3215.9 --> 3229.01
uh I don't know Missouri bear maybe I

3224.17 --> 3231.859
bet yeah you're going to have to present

3229.01 --> 3234.5
some actual in context evidence if

3231.859 --> 3236.15
you're want to put down that level of

3234.5 --> 3236.99
stuff that I don't know where you're

3236.15 --> 3239.809
getting all this

3236.99 --> 3242.77
I know the whole Rothschild situation

3239.809 --> 3247.4
really got it into England and all that

3242.77 --> 3251.359
but that is like post British Empire

3247.4 --> 3256.4
that's not really during the whole

3251.359 --> 3257.779
colonization era as far as I know but

3256.4 --> 3263.27
hey if you're onto something

3257.779 --> 3265.789
Oh were you just blurting out things you

3263.27 --> 3274.369
heard somewhere I don't know I never

3265.789 --> 3278.1090000000004
really know with you Missouri bear so

3274.369 --> 3278.109
yeah if you put it for me

3281.47 --> 3287.25
can I have a citation please let's just

3284.71 --> 3287.25
say it like that

3304.64 --> 3313.5099999999998
or are you - you are referencing like

3309.92 --> 3317.32
the colonial age right are you talking

3313.51 --> 3317.32
about the modern era

3334.54 --> 3338.86
I don't know we're good servant is

3336.58 --> 3347.29
Amanda young but I did speak to him over

3338.86 --> 3350.2200000000003
Skype this morning but yeah I might be

3347.29 --> 3350.22
too busy or something

3355.38 --> 3367.4100000000003
pairen metal the history of capitalism

3357.509 --> 3369.63
okay so I can assure you that I'm not

3367.41 --> 3372.6299999999997
gonna read that because I don't have it

3369.63 --> 3377.819
and I don't really like reading books

3372.63 --> 3380.4500000000003
and but I don't know if somebody sent it

3377.819 --> 3382.92
to me I would probably just read it

3380.45 --> 3385.259
because it does sound interesting and if

3382.92 --> 3390.98
it has a lot of historical references in

3385.259 --> 3390.98
it like actual proof that would be good

3397.04 --> 3403.64
I still think this is like post-colonial

3401.42 --> 3406.01
era this is just the industrialization

3403.64 --> 3407.33
and then that's well known that's kind

3406.01 --> 3409.9700000000003
of when they made the move

3407.33 --> 3413.3199999999997
you know robber barons and the whole

3409.97 --> 3413.3199999999997
Rothschild situation

3433.869 --> 3442.469
okay what if you say so I thought that

3438.099 --> 3442.469
the original Israelites kind of died out

3443.4 --> 3448.9590000000003
the or like I've heard this vfe I

3446.589 --> 3452.439
haven't really deeply researched it

3448.959 --> 3454.9489999999996
because it's kind of not my region like

3452.439 --> 3459.0389999999998
I mean more into ethereal Christianity

3454.949 --> 3462.279
but supposedly the original Jewish

3459.039 --> 3466.529
tribes were world a Carol extinct and

3462.279 --> 3470.969
these are just other groups that have

3466.529 --> 3470.969
associated themselves with the concept

3478.45 --> 3487.859
so Israelite tribes like is that even

3484.78 --> 3490.2400000000002
the same you know

3487.859 --> 3492.49
for me it is really difficult sometimes

3490.24 --> 3496.7099999999996
because it Israelites you know you know

3492.49 --> 3503.3799999999997
what the name means officially like the

3496.71 --> 3505.41
God's chosen or something and yeah it's

3503.38 --> 3508.0
used in many ways and then you have

3505.41 --> 3511.72
concept of Jews and it's used in many

3508.0 --> 3514.63
ways and sometimes I think it's really

3511.72 --> 3519.3999999999996
more every time Israel's brought up like

3514.63 --> 3523.1400000000003
it's this metaphorical effect of like a

3519.4 --> 3527.559
setting that is going to naturally

3523.14 --> 3532.049
repeat itself in societies over and over

3527.559 --> 3536.4700000000003
and over again just like Babylon concept

3532.049 --> 3538.599
will is likely to reimburse over and

3536.47 --> 3541.6299999999997
over and over again see like a pattern

3538.599 --> 3545.23
so is it all absolutely little it's no

3541.63 --> 3548.7400000000002
it's only about absolute dates in

3545.23 --> 3552.01
absolute time linear reality and only

3548.74 --> 3556.8999999999996
about a specific location it's only

3552.01 --> 3558.5200000000004
there you know and then if you just

3556.9 --> 3559.869
approach it like that then it's just

3558.52 --> 3561.309
going to be a lot of conflict and

3559.869 --> 3563.38
everybody's there's gonna be a thousand

3561.309 --> 3565.1800000000003
stories about different approaches

3563.38 --> 3565.9300000000003
different locations and yeah that's what

3565.18 --> 3569.1699999999996
we got

3565.93 --> 3572.02
that's what I've been poured full with

3569.17 --> 3574.599
in the last ten years like this person

3572.02 --> 3577.869
says that that person that is bad at it

3574.599 --> 3581.17
like endless it's kind of part of the

3577.869 --> 3584.619
reason why I stepped away from that the

3581.17 --> 3588.03
esoteric the exoteric s-- that just

3584.619 --> 3588.03
stick to the esoterics

3588.239 --> 3593.2490000000003
and just see it more like yeah it is a

3590.429 --> 3598.099
pattern it is a thing that keeps on

3593.249 --> 3598.0989999999997
coming back so

3600.61 --> 3606.61
really Jew was a slang term used to mock

3604.21 --> 3609.45
Israelites in captivity is that so I

3606.61 --> 3609.4500000000003
have no idea

3632.42 --> 3640.6800000000003
well what question mark I think that the

3636.51 --> 3647.46
original like the literal people in that

3640.68 --> 3650.43
time span probably did but yeah what is

3647.46 --> 3653.64
that if you're gonna take it as that

3650.43 --> 3658.2599999999998
literal people in that literal spot in

3653.64 --> 3660.27
that time then yeah I would say they're

3658.26 --> 3663.36
probably extinct but is that really what

3660.27 --> 3667.23
that means see that is my point is it

3663.36 --> 3672.9300000000003
really what that means or is an

3667.23 --> 3675.87
Israelite kind of a timeless concept is

3672.93 --> 3677.58
it all just about the pursuit of insider

3675.87 --> 3680.5499999999997
knowledge and managing with the world

3677.58 --> 3684.45
and principles and frequency is that

3680.55 --> 3688.29
what it more about you know what's in

3684.45 --> 3692.16
