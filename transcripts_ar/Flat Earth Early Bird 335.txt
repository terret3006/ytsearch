sun's not out so let's see who is in

94.369 --> 105.679
Chad Amanda Young was first Michael be a

gem stone monkey 3d Julia Pavan they had

105.679 --> 120.8
a meeting Major Tom yeah good to see you

109.599 --> 124.789

wound up during the debate so also was

126.56 --> 130.45
Nathan everybody was a bit wound up and

130.48 --> 139.06
kept on going and going and grim V oh my

136.819 --> 139.06
god

143.75 --> 152.01
crimpy was totally Bren dying out just

148.14 --> 161.67
crazy anyway yeah the debates were

152.01 --> 164.60999999999999
interesting lasted very long don't know

161.67 --> 166.79999999999998
if the after-show was going live later

164.61 --> 177.29000000000002
that evening or anything I didn't see

166.8 --> 179.82000000000002
that but it was very typical you know

177.29 --> 182.73
getting some really disgusting comments

179.82 --> 184.62
recently from trolls like normally

182.73 --> 187.59
they're just annoying they're just

184.62 --> 190.85
trying to screw me in my feelings

187.59 --> 193.56
somehow it's not gonna work but in the

190.85 --> 198.63
getting some really disgusting ones in

193.56 --> 202.35
there don't appreciate that yeah I wish

198.63 --> 203.94
others could have moderating powers over

202.35 --> 211.16
my comment section as well that would be

203.94 --> 211.16
very handy anyway

219.64 --> 222.57
oh really

222.87 --> 231.06
why not start monkey 3d I kind of like

228.34 --> 231.06
the contrast

235.62 --> 240.65
but yeah you know a frame is a frame

241.34 --> 247.8
potentially anything could be made for

243.66 --> 249.87
it you know technically if somebody out

247.8 --> 252.56900000000002
there things like oh that's not good

249.87 --> 258.09000000000003
enough I have I have a vision for the

252.569 --> 261.329
early bird show window frame okay sure

258.09 --> 263.19
you know if you if you're inspired to

261.329 --> 267.51
make something and you know how to do

263.19 --> 270.18
that with the transparency part of

267.51 --> 272.419
course as part of it and all that hey go

270.18 --> 284.479
ahead if you got if you got something

272.419 --> 284.479
it's just like was that guy again was it

285.37 --> 293.729
yeah was built gee he made that that

289.449 --> 296.53000000000003
early birds welding a play welded plate

293.729 --> 298.63
you know hey if you're inspired to do

296.53 --> 304.98999999999995
something I'm not stopping you and hey

298.63 --> 307.54
if it's if I like it and if you can yeah

304.99 --> 310.06
if you can take some commentary or some

307.54 --> 313.96000000000004
criticism could creative criticism of

310.06 --> 316.47
course then hey if you got a really good

313.96 --> 319.29999999999995
idea I'll take it

316.47 --> 323.20000000000005
technically Adam just took it off the

319.3 --> 325.63
internet as he said himself he just put

323.2 --> 329.62
it all together and he did a wide search

325.63 --> 332.11
and that was a lot of work but hey I am

329.62 --> 334.81
open for creative options from anyone

332.11 --> 337.0
anybody out there is like good at making

334.81 --> 339.82
those types of things and he has like

337.0 --> 342.51
the ultimate idea for the are win or we

339.82 --> 345.90999999999997
nyan window-frame

342.51 --> 348.90999999999997
sure you know make it in Toccoa tech

345.91 --> 350.5
inspired if you like why not maybe well

348.91 --> 352.21000000000004
although it may be a bit out of theme

350.5 --> 354.19
that's the thing as soon as you go in

352.21 --> 358.40999999999997
Toccoa tech you go into the steampunk

354.19 --> 363.01
region and that's very contrasting I

358.41 --> 365.97
like a more basic nature themed thing

363.01 --> 370.45
and also the the backdrop animation

365.97 --> 372.52000000000004
that's also just yeah a looping

370.45 --> 374.56
animation that's not the final option

372.52 --> 376.93
it's just that it's really nice for

374.56 --> 380.169
something you can just pluck off the

376.93 --> 385.78000000000003
internet it's it's really good really

380.169 --> 387.94
well found by Adam but hey I'm

385.78 --> 392.2
personally more open for a bit of a

387.94 --> 396.15
still frame like picture with potential

392.2 --> 400.33
animations and to be honest the picture

396.15 --> 402.92999999999995
that Adam used for the logo the picture

400.33 --> 407.74
in the backdrop man if I could have that

402.93 --> 410.889
type of scene animated as the animated

407.74 --> 416.01
backdrop now that would be absolutely

410.889 --> 416.01
stellar what yeah you know

416.43 --> 423.16
if it isn't out there somebody's got to

418.9 --> 425.40999999999997
make it and yeah probably not gonna do

423.16 --> 427.57000000000005
that for free or who knows who knows is

425.41 --> 431.8
what's gonna happen you know as I said

427.57 --> 433.51
I'm open for creative options and who

431.8 --> 436.54
knows maybe even people could do a

433.51 --> 438.37
business proposition in some way like

436.54 --> 440.29
okay I can make something really super

438.37 --> 442.21
but I gotta get some money for it and

440.29 --> 445.03000000000003
then I could ask you guys through

442.21 --> 446.56
GoFundMe and make it happen that way you

445.03 --> 449.94
know that's the funny thing about the

446.56 --> 457.24
Internet all options are on the table as

449.94 --> 459.34
long as you see them as an option haha

457.24 --> 464.02
when you clear their forest you will see

459.34 --> 467.95
Rivendell yeah I like that idea well you

464.02 --> 471.07
know Adam I said it before the problem

467.95 --> 474.46
is I know there's people out there that

471.07 --> 476.40999999999997
are just that have done perfected this

474.46 --> 479.71
skill as a hobby and that is concerning

476.41 --> 482.53000000000003
the game Skyrim and I also had all these

479.71 --> 486.52
mods modifications and everything or it

482.53 --> 489.09999999999997
would be ideal if I just had a mod where

486.52 --> 492.52
basically all hostilities would be taken

489.1 --> 495.82000000000005
away and you could just roam the country

492.52 --> 499.03
with camera view and then recorded or

495.82 --> 500.38
maybe even set a bow trail to walk

499.03 --> 503.46
through the landscape because there's

500.38 --> 508.24
some amazing landscapes in Skyrim and

503.46 --> 514.18
those would be just great as a backdrop

508.24 --> 517.599
I think or as a walkthrough thing but I

514.18 --> 519.7289999999999
yeah but I'd need somebody a little bit

517.599 --> 522.969
more skilled because I know it's out

519.729 --> 526.4200000000001
there I myself never even touched the

522.969 --> 529.24
mods I was like a very tidy person like

526.42 --> 534.25
oh no I'm not gonna risk the integrity

529.24 --> 535.9300000000001
of my official installation yeah I

534.25 --> 540.85
always been kind of like that nowadays

535.93 --> 542.9799999999999
it's all different because yeah I don't

540.85 --> 545.4200000000001
I'm not really up-to-date with gaming

542.98 --> 548.95
anymore as I used to be

545.42 --> 551.9
for me it's just recycled old stuff now

548.95 --> 553.37
yeah I know Adam I know I'm not saying

551.9 --> 556.97
that you should be the one doing that

553.37 --> 559.48
but I got an audience we got a lot of

556.97 --> 562.4
people that are good with visuals and

559.48 --> 566.27
probably some that have wide experience

562.4 --> 571.0
with games and game related media issues

566.27 --> 571.0
so hello fish

579.05 --> 582.15
[Music]

589.9 --> 592.5
hmm

594.76 --> 600.49
yes sacred a Shimon I agree and I

597.519 --> 605.589
everybody knew it back then that it was

600.49 --> 609.339
such a great model and well-rounded

605.589 --> 612.519
engine that was dynamic it was built to

609.339 --> 615.82
be open it's like programmers and [ __ ]

612.519 --> 617.5
know this [ __ ] and I knew programmers I

615.82 --> 621.4590000000001
just don't know programming or well I

617.5 --> 623.199
kind of do know it I just don't have the

621.459 --> 627.01
feel for it or something I don't have

623.199 --> 628.959
the patience but I kind of know the feel

627.01 --> 632.17
of it and yeah you know when certain

628.959 --> 635.26
games are just put out when they're like

632.17 --> 638.199
totally securitized and it becomes super

635.26 --> 640.42
annoying and there's problems and those

638.199 --> 642.7299999999999
problems persist very long and hard to

640.42 --> 644.9799999999999
get out of the way that yeah dad there's

642.73 --> 647.41
a lot of those games they're usually

644.98 --> 650.11
expensive and [ __ ] and very advertised

647.41 --> 653.62
but sometimes there's just these jewels

650.11 --> 657.73
in between where the creators were like

653.62 --> 660.69
inspired you could say inspired by logos

657.73 --> 665.47
too like the original programmers feel

660.69 --> 667.3290000000001
to just build something good and not be

665.47 --> 669.399
everything about copyrights and [ __ ] and

667.329 --> 671.199
just make something good and yeah people

669.399 --> 673.389
will copy it but it will be for the

671.199 --> 676.38
betterment of programs in general that

673.389 --> 680.8
kind of idea the original programmers

676.38 --> 685.72
vision and I think Skyrim is just one of

680.8 --> 688.7199999999999
those because it was just it was so well

685.72 --> 690.7900000000001
built and everybody knew it it was just

688.72 --> 691.87
a giant hype even in the moment and you

690.79 --> 693.9399999999999
know yeah you can have a good

691.87 --> 696.18
advertisement but with that with when

693.94 --> 700.149
the game turns out to be shitty it's

696.18 --> 702.8499999999999
it's a screeching halt or a slow death

700.149 --> 706.42
but with Skyrim was just boom everywhere

702.85 --> 711.639
Skyrim people made freakin their own

706.42 --> 713.38
music version like their own songs with

711.639 --> 716.41
Skyrim song there was a whole thing

713.38 --> 719.26
saying how much Skyrim [ __ ] was out

716.41 --> 722.98
there back in the day and I was a big

719.26 --> 727.0
fan of it but yeah not so much anymore

722.98 --> 728.5600000000001
but as for just how it looked and what

727.0 --> 733.15
you can do with it I think it

728.56 --> 738.1899999999999
would be fantastic as a backdrop for my

733.15 --> 742.84
show but I got a yeah well secret Asian

738.19 --> 744.73
man hid barred what do look ok secret

742.84 --> 746.89
Iseman it seems you know quite a lot

744.73 --> 749.47
about it maybe you could help me out if

746.89 --> 751.6899999999999
you just add me on skype or if you

749.47 --> 755.26
already did that just contact me - on

751.69 --> 759.37
skype and we'll figure it out I'll find

755.26 --> 764.76
my Skyrim installation and see if I can

759.37 --> 764.76
get it done it might take a while though

772.339 --> 777.97
I hope you can t greatest well I'm not

775.16 --> 780.5889999999999
in it for the game I just want I

777.97 --> 782.4200000000001
basically want that mod where everything

780.589 --> 785.0290000000001
come but related is out of the way even

782.42 --> 789.079
though yeah of course I want to hold the

785.029 --> 790.73
bow a very cool bow I still have all my

789.079 --> 792.559
upgraded characters anyway so it

790.73 --> 797.6
probably very easy to do I've already

792.559 --> 800.0889999999999
been everywhere and but I'll just need

797.6 --> 802.249
to I'll just be go walking around for

800.089 --> 804.7090000000001
the side so take like one or two days

802.249 --> 806.499
just to familiarize myself again with

804.709 --> 814.309
the areas how it looked

806.499 --> 823.4300000000001
think of a good tourist route and then

814.309 --> 825.41
get it yeah get it recorded and that's

823.43 --> 826.1289999999999
sufficient and who knows maybe at some

825.41 --> 834.43
other point

826.129 --> 837.98
I'll get another route and add it to the

834.43 --> 840.55
to the to the options always fun to have

837.98 --> 840.5500000000001
more options

843.24 --> 847.8
and I could put an beside like besides

846.209 --> 851.2489999999999
walking routes yeah I could definitely

847.8 --> 854.67
just set up the camera or rather the

851.249 --> 857.85
character from first-person vision up to

854.67 --> 859.8499999999999
a animated landscape and just take a

857.85 --> 862.999
still shot of that for a period and then

859.85 --> 867.0790000000001
loop it and then use that as an option

862.999 --> 871.4390000000001
it's hilarious I hope I won't get any

867.079 --> 873.9899999999999
copyright strikes for it though if I

871.439 --> 876.149
well although it would be covered up a

873.99 --> 878.85
lot it wouldn't just be the full picture

876.149 --> 885.319
every day I know but I think this is a

878.85 --> 885.3190000000001
good idea and I think I will make it so

888.199 --> 895.679
it's been watching more Star Trek next

891.42 --> 897.5999999999999
generation and also notice that

895.679 --> 902.129
apparently there's a new movie coming

897.6 --> 906.2090000000001
out and you had the trailer for that

902.129 --> 915.389
movie Picard that did kind of blow me

906.209 --> 917.6289999999999
away in a hopeful way just loved seeing

915.389 --> 922.019
the characters in there again and

917.629 --> 925.9490000000001
especially Anika that character 7:09

922.019 --> 939.99
just like what you still look that good

925.949 --> 944.1289999999999
damn damn woman so yeah and yeah looking

939.99 --> 948.389
forward to another peak hard-driven Star

944.129 --> 950.91
Trek movie very curious I if I think

948.389 --> 953.369
they're gonna do what they're gonna do

950.91 --> 955.759
that's going to be a very awesome that's

953.369 --> 959.249
going to be almost as cool as the

955.759 --> 963.42
Captain America that I think was it a

959.249 --> 965.5790000000001
second a second one where they were

963.42 --> 968.579
basically being betrayed from the inside

965.579 --> 970.92
out that that one was also extremely

968.579 --> 972.419
irrelevant at the time and maybe they're

970.92 --> 975.449
gonna do something like that began with

972.419 --> 975.91
Picard and like basically say like okay

975.449 --> 978.6999999999999
this is

975.91 --> 981.28
gone out of control these are not the

978.7 --> 985.84
principles that the Federation set out

981.28 --> 989.5899999999999
with and I love that I absolutely be

985.84 --> 992.2
totally hooked me with that and I

989.59 --> 995.4100000000001
remember it being said by Picard in the

992.2 --> 999.0400000000001
trailer something to that extent so did

995.41 --> 1002.16
ya I hope they're gonna take it serious

999.04 --> 1003.6899999999999
and not just like the show it overblown

1002.16 --> 1006.93
in the trailer and make it pretty

1003.69 --> 1008.7900000000001
isolated in the movie and easily solved

1006.93 --> 1012.78
I hope it's not gonna be something

1008.79 --> 1017.52
easily soft you know I hope they're

1012.78 --> 1020.8199999999999
really gonna basically try to push some

1017.52 --> 1023.4
kind of revolution in the Federation

1020.82 --> 1026.97
although not well maybe a diplomatic

1023.4 --> 1029.31
revolution I don't know I don't know

1026.97 --> 1033.66
anyway the yeah the trailer definitely

1029.31 --> 1038.24
sparked my curiosity so they check it

1033.66 --> 1038.24
out and yeah we'll see what it will be

1048.549 --> 1064.19
okay alright so fishies who are you then

1055.159 --> 1066.46
I want to bait you so I don't know who

1064.19 --> 1066.46
you are

1095.9 --> 1097.93
ooh

1105.48 --> 1115.7
hey Evan ah cool

1112.13 --> 1121.2
you bent here bait in the middle this

1115.7 --> 1126.51
big oak yeah I'm I think I pretty much

1121.2 --> 1131.76
fully recovered from my my prolonged flu

1126.51 --> 1133.71
experience yeah yeah I really do it

1131.76 --> 1139.98
pretty much this morning also I had a

1133.71 --> 1143.8400000000001
really great meal yesterday I finally

1139.98 --> 1143.84
made that spaghetti and it was awesome

1147.88 --> 1151.99
yeah yeah with you to three weeks crazy

1151.21 --> 1162.3400000000001
wasn't it

1151.99 --> 1165.63
Oh with me too a few times via Skype

1162.34 --> 1165.6299999999999
request who

1182.87 --> 1190.1299999999999
that from Brian David or something

1186.89 --> 1193.3700000000001
because I do get look I have a lot of

1190.13 --> 1196.0100000000002
people these days on skype but contact

1193.37 --> 1197.6499999999999
is sporadic so even on skype sometimes

1196.01 --> 1200.75
if your gonna be very chatty

1197.65 --> 1203.21
is a great tendency that I'll just start

1200.75 --> 1204.59
to ignore you even though some of what

1203.21 --> 1208.49
you're saying it might be interesting

1204.59 --> 1210.59
because it's just tougher to keep up

1208.49 --> 1212.69
with very extensive conversation

1210.59 --> 1216.23
especially we gotta go I got a lot of

1212.69 --> 1218.15
chatty people including ballers that at

1216.23 --> 1221.65
some point I tend to block because they

1218.15 --> 1225.2900000000002
just refuse to shut up even though I

1221.65 --> 1227.8100000000002
specifically asked them to probably have

1225.29 --> 1235.19
a hint as to which people I'm talking

1227.81 --> 1238.6299999999999
about but I don't see remember anyone on

1235.19 --> 1242.18
skype that I refuse to take a call from

1238.63 --> 1247.22
maybe Brenda at times especially because

1242.18 --> 1250.67
our timing is just the worst I can't

1247.22 --> 1252.41
think of anyone else really most people

1250.67 --> 1259.8500000000001
just want to talk they don't want to

1252.41 --> 1262.21
come on life so hello Brendan cook and

1259.85 --> 1262.2099999999998
Ian Adams

1264.59 --> 1267.6999999999998
[Music]

1276.17 --> 1283.13
all right oh so you're a baller that

1280.34 --> 1284.99
just wants to whine in chat one of those

1283.13 --> 1287.1200000000001
yeah I've I've banned quite a lot of

1284.99 --> 1289.3700000000001
those none of those actually wanted to

1287.12 --> 1293.0
debate me they just wanted to spam my

1289.37 --> 1295.07
chat with their [ __ ] and not really have

1293.0 --> 1297.8
being forced to respond in the moment

1295.07 --> 1300.97
because of there's a verbal conversation

1297.8 --> 1300.97
going on so

1318.39 --> 1321.14
yeah

1333.23 --> 1339.21
yeah well why don't you just reveal who

1336.269 --> 1341.039
you are supposedly and let's get on with

1339.21 --> 1344.3890000000001
it because you're doing it again

1341.039 --> 1347.549
you're now in chat as another person

1344.389 --> 1349.559
whining again how you supposedly did

1347.549 --> 1353.7
something without even revealing who you

1349.559 --> 1356.57
are and you're just being annoying and

1353.7 --> 1356.57
distraction

1368.11 --> 1374.09
right yeah well whatever questions

1371.15 --> 1377.0
baller supposedly give money for

1374.09 --> 1379.85
answering they never do I've never seen

1377.0 --> 1383.9
any baller ever do that so why the hell

1379.85 --> 1386.24
would I accept your challenge at it I've

1383.9 --> 1389.72
never ever seen a baller pay out

1386.24 --> 1391.82
anything relating to some kind of bad

1389.72 --> 1395.77
it's almost like at principle not to

1391.82 --> 1401.33
even when they and they'll do the back

1395.77 --> 1403.28
just not fulfill it after they lose even

1401.33 --> 1406.49
though they can see coming that they

1403.28 --> 1409.28
lose they'll just still do it so I don't

1406.49 --> 1412.46
see why I would take upon me any kind of

1409.28 --> 1415.54
bet for money when I know ballers don't

1412.46 --> 1415.54
pay up no matter what

1415.9 --> 1423.5300000000002
alright oh that's fine look if you want

1420.08 --> 1426.76
to pay first go ahead you can ask

1423.53 --> 1431.66
questions I'm always open for questions

1426.76 --> 1434.39
don't get this like I'm always open for

1431.66 --> 1440.0800000000002
questions it's it's the default for the

1434.39 --> 1440.0800000000002
show this is just silly

1459.48 --> 1462.579
[Music]

1471.26 --> 1477.2
I guarantee to answering well you don't

1474.559 --> 1479.1789999999999
have any guarantee to answering it all

1477.2 --> 1483.95
depends on the nature of the question of

1479.179 --> 1486.14
course but I always try to answer any

1483.95 --> 1490.88
type of questions that aren't like

1486.14 --> 1496.2990000000002
obvious traps some kind to make me say

1490.88 --> 1500.2700000000002
things that that'll that I will regret

1496.299 --> 1501.86
so I don't know it all depends on the

1500.27 --> 1503.9
questions if there are just honest

1501.86 --> 1506.1999999999998
questions or technical questions yes

1503.9 --> 1509.9
sure I'll answer them that's all fine I

1506.2 --> 1511.8500000000001
always do sometimes when people don't

1509.9 --> 1514.669
even expect an elaborate answer I'll

1511.85 --> 1517.4599999999998
answer them in five Kasich consequential

1514.669 --> 1519.89
minutes in a full elaborate answered

1517.46 --> 1530.5
nonetheless so I don't see the issue

1519.89 --> 1530.5
here yeah yeah all people free people

1534.96 --> 1542.01
I don't know I'd rather focus on just

1538.05 --> 1544.23
breaking this straw man rumor that he's

1542.01 --> 1547.14
trying to plan as he goes that I don't

1544.23 --> 1549.45
answer questions or that people require

1547.14 --> 1551.67
some kind of guarantee for me to answer

1549.45 --> 1555.66
questions when I tend to answer

1551.67 --> 1560.97
questions better and more elaborately

1555.66 --> 1563.4
than anyone except for those that have

1560.97 --> 1569.06
very detailed specific knowledge about

1563.4 --> 1569.0600000000002
certain regions that I don't possess so

1572.24 --> 1579.72
hey and if he's gonna give me money

1574.35 --> 1582.1799999999998
that's cool I'll accept it and I'll

1579.72 --> 1583.97
definitely try to answer the questions

1582.18 --> 1588.3
[Music]

1583.97 --> 1595.01
that's not a big claim it's a very

1588.3 --> 1595.01
specific outlet lay out what I can do

1603.04 --> 1611.86
no no why don't you just ask the

1606.25 --> 1614.65
questions right now look if you're gonna

1611.86 --> 1617.62
expect me to give you a presentation

1614.65 --> 1621.88
with visuals and all that yeah that's

1617.62 --> 1624.8799999999999
that's not gonna happen but I can just

1621.88 --> 1630.97
answer things that's what I do in the

1624.88 --> 1634.5
moment could lay it all out like unless

1630.97 --> 1639.28
your questions are just ridiculously

1634.5 --> 1642.13
unanswerable and that kind of thing like

1639.28 --> 1644.26
ooh what causes the eclipses for example

1642.13 --> 1647.2900000000002
you know if you're gonna go there that

1644.26 --> 1649.6
is very blatant yeah I don't know but it

1647.29 --> 1652.02
is definitely a light based phenomena

1649.6 --> 1652.02
all of it

1652.27 --> 1655.3899999999999
[Music]

1658.74 --> 1661.869
[Music]

1665.26 --> 1670.48
so should I check my paypal already or

1668.44 --> 1673.299
are you just gonna back out at the last

1670.48 --> 1689.14
moment and just leave me hanging like a

1673.299 --> 1691.66
typical baller oh well thank you thank

1689.14 --> 1692.5900000000001
you for giving me this chance to defend

1691.66 --> 1695.65
myself

1692.59 --> 1699.1599999999999
to build a proper answer it I don't need

1695.65 --> 1704.19
it though because you might have figured

1699.16 --> 1707.5900000000001
out so far that once I just once

1704.19 --> 1710.71
information is released to me I will

1707.59 --> 1713.799
freakin figure it out well seemingly

1710.71 --> 1718.27
instantly and just figure it out that's

1713.799 --> 1720.94
what I do quick inside so I don't need

1718.27 --> 1723.22
proper time to respond I don't need to

1720.94 --> 1725.1100000000001
build some kind of mechanism I have a

1723.22 --> 1730.51
very clear oversight over what I know

1725.11 --> 1733.62
concerning these matters so just ask me

1730.51 --> 1733.62
your questions

1734.45 --> 1737.64
[Music]

1752.85 --> 1757.6999999999998
Wow so you don't even have the questions

1759.169 --> 1766.019
even though you claimed that you had

1762.83 --> 1771.059
them earlier and never refused to answer

1766.019 --> 1773.009
them it's fascinating and well nothing

1771.059 --> 1778.549
fascinating anymore actually because it

1773.009 --> 1778.549
happened so many times it's just

1785.67 --> 1792.049
like what's the problem are you

1789.6 --> 1797.04
literally trying to find some kind of

1792.049 --> 1798.96
weakness in in my information my

1797.04 --> 1801.21
preponderance of evidences and

1798.96 --> 1805.71
information and my conceptualization

1801.21 --> 1807.9
somehow yeah but you don't even look

1805.71 --> 1810.27
dude you don't even have your questions

1807.9 --> 1812.3400000000001
ready you said you had questions for me

1810.27 --> 1815.4
you were actually putting out money on

1812.34 --> 1818.01
it and now you say you have to think

1815.4 --> 1820.169
about it well there's only one reason

1818.01 --> 1822.77
for that and that is you don't have

1820.169 --> 1825.3600000000001
these questions that you said you have

1822.77 --> 1828.48
they have many questions so why don't

1825.36 --> 1831.2299999999998
you ask them your best FREE you want

1828.48 --> 1833.46
yeah but you don't need to find anything

1831.23 --> 1838.32
presuming that I will dodge it why don't

1833.46 --> 1841.77
you just ask questions because your

1838.32 --> 1843.6599999999999
footing out claims and you're saying all

1841.77 --> 1846.15
these things about me and I'm just

1843.66 --> 1847.74
wondering why I haven't banned you yet

1846.15 --> 1857.49
because you're being really annoying why

1847.74 --> 1859.29
don't you ask the questions you know I

1857.49 --> 1861.63
don't even give a [ __ ] about your

1859.29 --> 1862.86
freaking money anymore okay just ask me

1861.63 --> 1865.169
your damn questions

1862.86 --> 1868.11
and afterward if there is an afterword

1865.169 --> 1870.419
if you don't run away or something then

1868.11 --> 1873.12
you can pay me those fifty euros that's

1870.419 --> 1877.41
all fine why don't you just ask me your

1873.12 --> 1879.1499999999999
damn questions and that doesn't mean

1877.41 --> 1882.96
that you're never gonna get to ask any

1879.15 --> 1885.45
questions after that cuz I want you

1882.96 --> 1889.16
answer plenty of questions but just go

1885.45 --> 1889.16
ahead and actually ask one

1901.94 --> 1909.539
I'm not talking to you Brandon cook but

1907.919 --> 1915.0590000000002
hey if you want to ask a question that's

1909.539 --> 1917.94
fine too this weirdo fish guy is not the

1915.059 --> 1925.86
only person that has dibs on asking

1917.94 --> 1927.779
questions okay well first questions not

1925.86 --> 1930.4499999999998
flattered through late it's about Social

1927.779 --> 1933.859
Affairs okay well you know what I'll

1930.45 --> 1936.6000000000001
just answer the question because you

1933.859 --> 1939.48
because you looked very carefully at

1936.6 --> 1941.6999999999998
finding a good question that I wouldn't

1939.48 --> 1944.279
refuse to answer because you think that

1941.7 --> 1947.19
that question you just put there is a

1944.279 --> 1950.759
question that I would refuse not refuse

1947.19 --> 1953.429
to us seems extremely disingenuous but

1950.759 --> 1957.929
I'm gonna answer it anyway because I

1953.429 --> 1961.6490000000001
don't give a [ __ ] okay right so why do I

1957.929 --> 1966.659
act like a sycophant to Nathan because

1961.649 --> 1971.4889999999998
it works and because you need to get

1966.659 --> 1974.1000000000001
around you know and at the same time I

1971.489 --> 1979.1000000000001
don't do it infinitely there's a limit

1974.1 --> 1981.4189999999999
to the amount of that type of indulging

1979.1 --> 1984.6589999999999
because I got my limits everybody got

1981.419 --> 1988.2
their limits it's just part of keeping

1984.659 --> 1992.7
things going it's part of being part of

1988.2 --> 1997.019
a crew I don't like it but at least with

1992.7 --> 1999.539
Nathan I can trust that he'll recognize

1997.019 --> 2003.519
the act for what it is and not just

1999.539 --> 2007.9089999999999
forget about it he realizes what he does

2003.519 --> 2011.299
it's not done as a random act a lot of

2007.909 --> 2014.989
these things although some of it is also

2011.299 --> 2019.129
a kind of theatrics it is showing like

2014.989 --> 2021.6390000000001
yeah he is the top dog as towards the

2019.129 --> 2023.4189999999999
audience rather than to me really and

2021.639 --> 2028.07
yeah that's what it is

2023.419 --> 2031.2990000000002
ah so any more questions that you're

2028.07 --> 2034.07
certain that I will not refuse to answer

2031.299 --> 2038.87
fish guy

2034.07 --> 2040.61
oh now we suddenly just pumping them out

2038.87 --> 2047.1689999999999
all of a sudden or are you now talking

2040.61 --> 2050.5099999999998
to somebody else what do you gain from

2047.169 --> 2052.52
that's a follow-up question is that your

2050.51 --> 2056.0600000000004
second question is that question one and

2052.52 --> 2061.88
a half what do you gain from being on

2056.06 --> 2064.04
his show and being denigrated well it

2061.88 --> 2067.7000000000003
actually gets me respect funnily enough

2064.04 --> 2070.46
because it shows that I am NOT an animal

2067.7 --> 2075.2799999999997
that I can actually control my impulses

2070.46 --> 2079.09
unlike a lot of ballers that I can

2075.28 --> 2082.19
control myself and that gets me respect

2079.09 --> 2085.61
funnily enough it is a lot of people

2082.19 --> 2087.56
that can do that can't see that so I do

2085.61 --> 2090.9190000000003
actually get something out of it funny

2087.56 --> 2093.04
isn't it the deeper you try to dig into

2090.919 --> 2096.65
some kind of question that hurts me the

2093.04 --> 2098.48
more treasure I can find there yeah

2096.65 --> 2101.2400000000002
that's one of the advantages of being me

2098.48 --> 2110.42
so got any more questions mister fish

2101.24 --> 2116.1499999999996
guy oh it's not how it comes across is

2110.42 --> 2118.58
it well are you saying I'm not answering

2116.15 --> 2120.92
your question he treats me like a child

2118.58 --> 2123.58
well no he doesn't the absolutely

2120.92 --> 2129.4700000000003
doesn't and if he would I would

2123.58 --> 2133.34
completely hammer him he knows that he

2129.47 --> 2135.85
does treat me like a younger individual

2133.34 --> 2138.9100000000003
though but the funny thing about that is

2135.85 --> 2142.88
weirdly enough that's kind of my

2138.91 --> 2145.49
position that I like to then tend to

2142.88 --> 2145.94
take in a social hierarchy I can't help

2145.49 --> 2150.9199999999996
it

2145.94 --> 2152.9900000000002
it's what I'm used to so to me it's not

2150.92 --> 2153.56
that much of a detriment and I don't see

2152.99 --> 2155.54
him

2153.56 --> 2157.2799999999997
treating me like a child that could be a

2155.54 --> 2160.22
lot worse and if you will do that I

2157.28 --> 2162.53
would respond the same as I did when I

2160.22 --> 2164.8999999999996
was younger even to my own parents and

2162.53 --> 2167.19
say just like screw you I'm not a [ __ ]

2164.9 --> 2169.88
I totally get what's going on

2167.19 --> 2172.59
and I'm trying to deal with my own

2169.88 --> 2177.7200000000003
impulses and trying to find what I want

2172.59 --> 2180.06
as well so yeah it's a bit over

2177.72 --> 2185.0099999999998
exaggeration to say that he's treating

2180.06 --> 2188.25
me like a child but he does behold me as

2185.01 --> 2191.8500000000004
a younger person and he is a parent so

2188.25 --> 2196.02
for him that is kind of like probably

2191.85 --> 2198.66
also convenience she has more parenting

2196.02 --> 2202.68
impulses probably because he has young

2198.66 --> 2204.7799999999997
kids and he has fatherly needs I guess

2202.68 --> 2208.22
so it's kind of a dynamics that just

2204.78 --> 2210.57
works it just works fine you know and

2208.22 --> 2216.12
sometimes there's a little bit of unease

2210.57 --> 2218.9100000000003
between us but we don't do damage while

2216.12 --> 2220.83
that happens and we try to restore if

2218.91 --> 2223.3799999999997
there's some kind of mistake or

2220.83 --> 2227.73
misunderstanding he does it I try to do

2223.38 --> 2229.62
it and it's fine you know could be a lot

2227.73 --> 2233.07
worse there's some other people out

2229.62 --> 2236.7599999999998
there we yeah you might remember about

2233.07 --> 2238.8900000000003
that I can't get along that well with

2236.76 --> 2241.1400000000003
I've been very expressive about it

2238.89 --> 2245.19
and I am when things actually go wrong

2241.14 --> 2246.75
socially I do speak out about it so and

2245.19 --> 2250.53
witness and that's just not the case

2246.75 --> 2251.34
so got any more questions fish guy any

2250.53 --> 2253.11
more questions

2251.34 --> 2257.4900000000002
anything flat earther or later it's just

2253.11 --> 2261.06
just social rumors isn't it just about

2257.49 --> 2265.52
the people you know you don't even care

2261.06 --> 2268.59
about the data now I think it's just

2265.52 --> 2272.63
well this seems to be the first type of

2268.59 --> 2275.9100000000003
question from you that may actually be

2272.63 --> 2277.9500000000003
somewhat science related qe says he's

2275.91 --> 2282.8399999999997
proven the existence of God via the

2277.95 --> 2286.74
second law of thermodynamics do I agree

2282.84 --> 2291.21
with this claim I don't really

2286.74 --> 2293.97
understand the claim I think in a direct

2291.21 --> 2295.38
well yeah I would have to see a more

2293.97 --> 2298.5
elaborate explanation he might have

2295.38 --> 2300.94
claimed that I probably skipped that I'm

2298.5 --> 2304.119
not really interested so much in

2300.94 --> 2307.329
proving the existence of God rather than

2304.119 --> 2310.63
proving the existence of a design so

2307.329 --> 2316.96
those issues are John's issues that's

2310.63 --> 2324.04
his personal path discovery and approach

2316.96 --> 2327.2200000000003
it's not mine but yeah I do feel that a

2324.04 --> 2330.54
design and creation and therefore a

2327.22 --> 2336.5789999999997
creator logical necessities and all that

2330.54 --> 2339.46
are yet they are inevitable doesn't mean

2336.579 --> 2342.9300000000003
that anything written would therefore be

2339.46 --> 2348.849
absolute even in an in in a direct sense

2342.93 --> 2355.0299999999997
but just then creation itself the how

2348.849 --> 2360.46
things are cannot come from nothing by

2355.03 --> 2364.0600000000004
itself there has to be a design maybe

2360.46 --> 2368.91
you could go so far as to reason out or

2364.06 --> 2368.91
philosophize that the design is

2370.349 --> 2375.819
seemingly random in how it would build

2373.119 --> 2377.6800000000003
up it's like technically if God if the

2375.819 --> 2382.5
Creator if the designer would envision

2377.68 --> 2387.91
it he could and force some kind of weird

2382.5 --> 2391.06
evolution type vision but with pre

2387.91 --> 2393.31
design aspects in creation itself he

2391.06 --> 2396.19
could make evolution work if he wanted

2393.31 --> 2398.68
to but I don't think it's the case it

2396.19 --> 2403.48
doesn't reflect upon evidence that we

2398.68 --> 2406.24
find out there so I'm much more

2403.48 --> 2409.54
interested in just the nature of the

2406.24 --> 2413.14
building blocks of creation and of the

2409.54 --> 2418.06
material realm itself from all aspects

2413.14 --> 2420.94
all of them I do not exclude any type of

2418.06 --> 2425.25
approach when trying to figure out the

2420.94 --> 2425.25
nature so

2426.1 --> 2429.5499999999997
but claim

2434.91 --> 2440.7
what you gotta be more specific about

2438.329 --> 2450.6600000000003
that well what claim did I make a

2440.7 --> 2453.1699999999996
scientific claim or are you now straw

2450.66 --> 2453.17
Manning me

2461.93 --> 2466.14
anyone by the way sorry everybody else

2464.699 --> 2469.1
for me

2466.14 --> 2472.6
seemingly ignoring you

2469.1 --> 2472.6
[Music]

2484.77 --> 2492.359
the world had to have a designer now I'm

2487.349 --> 2496.849
saying there is a design in all things

2492.359 --> 2503.119
not the world not even how the world

2496.849 --> 2509.099
appears to be no just what things are

2503.119 --> 2514.44
just what they are reveals there can be

2509.099 --> 2517.8300000000004
a coincidence based progression from a

2514.44 --> 2520.13
material perspective it's illogical from

2517.83 --> 2523.56
a spiritual perspective well that

2520.13 --> 2525.81
immediately kind of walks outside of the

2523.56 --> 2529.41
material realm that's the issue there is

2525.81 --> 2532.2
some validity to the idea and that's

2529.41 --> 2536.359
funny other works the idea of spiritual

2532.2 --> 2541.91
evolution or consciousness revolution

2536.359 --> 2546.77
but as for physical things and life

2541.91 --> 2550.44
foundational aspects it doesn't work

2546.77 --> 2552.75
it's all designed it's from scratch

2550.44 --> 2556.83
design and as time progresses it

2552.75 --> 2558.599
degenerates it doesn't enhance and hey

2556.83 --> 2561.63
within the generation there are

2558.599 --> 2565.349
sometimes interesting flukes side

2561.63 --> 2570.69
effects like aberrational talents for

2565.349 --> 2575.79
example but those are the side effects

2570.69 --> 2578.46
and they don't it doesn't keep on

2575.79 --> 2581.25
progressing the you know instead the

2578.46 --> 2584.16
degeneration continues and then the

2581.25 --> 2588.869
talents and they die out with the dying

2584.16 --> 2591.02
out of the overall gene group that's how

2588.869 --> 2595.9500000000003
it really works that's how I

2591.02 --> 2597.99
conceptualize that's what I've seen when

2595.95 --> 2599.9399999999996
I hear about what I've learned

2597.99 --> 2604.74
throughout my life it is kind of

2599.94 --> 2608.69
intuitive as well so I'm not claiming

2604.74 --> 2608.6899999999996
any scientific evidence for any of this

2619.08 --> 2622.17
[Music]

2632.04 --> 2645.0
and now Fyodor Dostoevsky that's just

2637.83 --> 2647.31
wrong I'm not well I might be just a

2645.0 --> 2656.58
little bit masochistic but not in the

2647.31 --> 2659.0099999999998
classical sense it's rather that I've

2656.58 --> 2663.2599999999998
maintained as part of my character I

2659.01 --> 2667.2900000000004
guess a childish impulse of being cheeky

2663.26 --> 2671.51
being a smartass and also with the

2667.29 --> 2671.5099999999998
expectance that comes with it of being

2672.68 --> 2677.7599999999998
being pushed back being punished a

2675.54 --> 2680.25
little for it that's that's what that is

2677.76 --> 2681.9
not masochism it's just something that

2680.25 --> 2686.85
I'd like to do and then kind of the

2681.9 --> 2693.39
natural consequences of doing it and I

2686.85 --> 2697.23
don't see it as abuse so no if there was

2693.39 --> 2699.24
some real abuse I would make a stand and

2697.23 --> 2703.58
to be fair at times I have when I

2699.24 --> 2703.58
thought that things were out of balance

2705.12 --> 2712.95
[Music]

2709.69 --> 2712.9500000000003
Oh God

2714.3 --> 2720.4900000000002
hey Nathan by the way yeah

2717.79 --> 2722.77
the ballers today are on a character

2720.49 --> 2724.8399999999997
hunt there they're trying to mate

2722.77 --> 2729.34
they're trying to instigate some kind of

2724.84 --> 2732.27
war between us they think that our

2729.34 --> 2734.9500000000003
relations are malformed they're just

2732.27 --> 2737.17
painting this dark picture over our

2734.95 --> 2740.74
internal relations and communications

2737.17 --> 2744.58
and suggesting we should abandon this

2740.74 --> 2746.62
it's all wrong it's evil go abuse

2744.58 --> 2753.16
everywhere oh we're all building one

2746.62 --> 2757.24
another our instead of any kind of valid

2753.16 --> 2759.37
technical questions but ya know the fish

2757.24 --> 2760.39
guy that thought I've refused to answer

2759.37 --> 2764.1099999999997
his questions

2760.39 --> 2767.0099999999998
and wouldn't debate him asked all three

2764.11 --> 2774.61
personal questions about people and

2767.01 --> 2777.4900000000002
their beliefs and I kind of do expect no

2774.61 --> 2781.6
no not at all and don't make sure excuse

2777.49 --> 2782.4399999999996
me yeah by the way I did answer all your

2781.6 --> 2791.2799999999997
questions

2782.44 --> 2795.4
fish so well according to your own what

2791.28 --> 2797.38
according to your own argument since I

2795.4 --> 2801.15
did answer all your questions in utter

2797.38 --> 2804.07
detail all of them all three of them I

2801.15 --> 2806.14
don't know if even answer the fourth

2804.07 --> 2808.6000000000004
question because at some point you just

2806.14 --> 2812.5899999999997
kept on going no I haven't

2808.6 --> 2818.68
oh really I haven't answer oh okay

2812.59 --> 2821.59
all right this one if fvv is Paul earth

2818.68 --> 2828.04
in court who would have the most

2821.59 --> 2832.03
positive evidence flat earth huge huge

2828.04 --> 2836.38
amount of actual evidence with much more

2832.03 --> 2840.5800000000004
weight and the funny thing is the whole

2836.38 --> 2843.52
focus within courts the angle of a flat

2840.58 --> 2846.67
earth group that would yeah

2843.52 --> 2848.11
oppose against the ball in court

2846.67 --> 2849.64
they wouldn't focus so much and even

2848.11 --> 2851.9500000000003
trying to prove some kind of model

2849.64 --> 2854.3199999999997
that's the funny thing they just put out

2851.95 --> 2857.1099999999997
the evidence saying that the ball is

2854.32 --> 2858.67
just broken there is no evidence but

2857.11 --> 2861.52
there are is a lot of claims and the

2858.67 --> 2864.9700000000003
ball people will not have anything to

2861.52 --> 2867.22
refute that because we really and this

2864.97 --> 2871.45
will be very carefully prepared have not

2867.22 --> 2876.3399999999997
made any big claims except maybe for

2871.45 --> 2877.8399999999997
flat aspect of the realm and that there

2876.34 --> 2881.9100000000003
has to be a container all that all

2877.84 --> 2885.06
things that are proven by physics so

2881.91 --> 2895.21
does that answer your question now

2885.06 --> 2898.63
didn't another one very very right so

2895.21 --> 2901.41
anything else you need yeah I don't give

2898.63 --> 2905.02
a [ __ ] about what you really think is

2901.41 --> 2908.2799999999997
abuse or not I did just did I answer all

2905.02 --> 2908.28
your questions or didn't I

2915.88 --> 2922.87
now Nathan can you leave it until we're

2919.33 --> 2925.95
done please because I want to get a

2922.87 --> 2931.12
confirmation that I answered all

2925.95 --> 2933.75
questions that this person things are

2931.12 --> 2936.49
relevant among the ones that he asked

2933.75 --> 2945.75
and after that we can get into asking

2936.49 --> 2945.75
him some questions if you want that so

2958.83 --> 2961.94
anything more

2963.85 --> 2971.89
oh really I swerved around them no I

2968.29 --> 2973.9
addressed every single one that's a

2971.89 --> 2979.5699999999997
blatant lie

2973.9 --> 2983.34
I addressed everyone in detail beyond

2979.57 --> 2988.54
everyone's expectations here so I

2983.34 --> 2993.9100000000003
answered your questions I thought it was

2988.54 --> 2996.0099999999998
you yeah I knew it was you right so are

2993.91 --> 2999.54
you gonna be just a total [ __ ] and

2996.01 --> 3003.8300000000004
get banned and all that or are you gonna

2999.54 --> 3003.83
deliver what's it gonna be

3009.73 --> 3012.92
[Music]

3025.26 --> 3028.3190000000004
[Music]

3050.52 --> 3058.38
[Music]

3052.49 --> 3061.14
now I I gave you my position I said just

3058.38 --> 3064.32
ask your damn questions and I'll answer

3061.14 --> 3068.6099999999997
them no matter what but hey you still

3064.32 --> 3071.46
made that suppose it promise or whatever

3068.61 --> 3074.82
that's worth now about giving me this

3071.46 --> 3078.7200000000003
money so well it's up to you if you're

3074.82 --> 3081.38
just gonna be you know what or if you're

3078.72 --> 3082.66
just gonna put the D to the word as I

3081.38 --> 3085.85
have

3082.66 --> 3085.85
[Music]

3104.14 --> 3107.5789999999997
a yes or no will suffice

3126.33 --> 3129.409
[Music]

3142.05 --> 3147.1200000000003
because before a debate so what does

3144.81 --> 3153.29
that mean does that mean that you want

3147.12 --> 3153.29
to be on with me on skype on my show

3162.17 --> 3167.58
now barely you you just made yourself

3165.21 --> 3169.98
look like a total dick because all your

3167.58 --> 3173.64
questions were all personally focused

3169.98 --> 3175.68
all focused on people and relations

3173.64 --> 3179.8399999999997
between people it's disgusting

3175.68 --> 3179.8399999999997
wasn't even freaking flat earth related

3180.56 --> 3195.12
except maybe the stupid court question

3183.42 --> 3197.96
which I answered in full as well get out

3195.12 --> 3197.96
here you [ __ ]

3426.72 --> 3432.81
Armstrong that guy and I don't know his

3430.62 --> 3438.33
wife or his sister or whatever they've

3432.81 --> 3442.47
been nagging me in comments like troll

3438.33 --> 3446.72

3442.47 --> 3450.89
commentary just being dicks both of them

3446.72 --> 3454.5299999999997
like that woman even sent me

3450.89 --> 3459.69
PayPal donations of sense just to troll

3454.53 --> 3467.28
me terrible individuals and I'm sure

3459.69 --> 3470.48
they're related in some way because they

3467.28 --> 3470.48
behave exactly the same

3476.54 --> 3482.69
okay well maybe he just has a weird

3480.08 --> 3486.02
female from they suited him for his

3482.69 --> 3488.51
PayPal account I don't know maybe well

3486.02 --> 3491.18
maybe it's just a weird stellar

3488.51 --> 3494.1800000000003
coincidence that two people both named

3491.18 --> 3494.66
Armstrong in exactly the same way are

3494.18 --> 3498.71
being

3494.66 --> 3501.35
similarly trolling me in exactly the

same fashion with the same attitude

that's that would be just weird

who knows could be okay look I could be

3507.68 --> 3516.0699999999997
mistaken but that would be one hell of a

you all heard what he did in this chat

all the stupid questions he asked about

other people insinuating all kinds of

3579.66 --> 3583.0099999999998
so disgusting Nathan

why do you say Nathan

3599.69 --> 3605.539
I don't know maybe Simon Dan can back up

3602.569 --> 3607.97
why he thinks we are so disgusting what

3605.539 --> 3611.0890000000004
exactly we specifically do

3607.97 --> 3613.97
we're so disgusting besides muting

3613.97 --> 3617.8999999999996
long pauses when people ask you actually

3615.77 --> 3620.18
ask them questions and when they don't

3617.9 --> 3622.4300000000003
answer then start getting in

3620.18 --> 3625.22
conversation and then they talk over you

3622.43 --> 3632.359
non-stop and then complain about being

3625.22 --> 3634.0989999999997
interrupted you mean that or anything

3632.359 --> 3636.5
more specific because I think you're

3634.099 --> 3640.4
disgusting individual because of your

3636.5 --> 3643.579
blatant misinformation and your

3640.4 --> 3645.38
piss-poor research yet you're doubling

3643.579 --> 3648.349
down on information that you haven't

3645.38 --> 3652.46
really researched like it's okay to just

3648.349 --> 3656.21
bluff your way through things and you're

3652.46 --> 3659.299
a sneak you're literally openly

3656.21 --> 3662.18
cowardice Simon and it's not a quality

3659.299 --> 3664.49
that I respect because you just you just

3662.18 --> 3668.359
try to fish for people to come to your

3664.49 --> 3672.2889999999998
show but you won't even actually join an

3668.359 --> 3675.65
open platform where you know people will

3672.289 --> 3678.65
treat you with the D with a level of

3675.65 --> 3682.7000000000003
decency that you would deserve at least

3678.65 --> 3684.17
if you behave properly because yeah

3682.7 --> 3686.6299999999997
there are some other places with other

3684.17 --> 3688.46
flat earthers that yeah if you got in

3686.63 --> 3691.339
there they'd probably start pounding on

3688.46 --> 3696.17
you instantly for all the the sneaky

3691.339 --> 3698.95
disgusting [ __ ] you've done but there's

3696.17 --> 3701.559
other people out there that actually

3698.95 --> 3704.8999999999996
would approach it differently and see

3701.559 --> 3708.5
that well if you would actually come on

3704.9 --> 3711.71
somebody the others panel and really

3708.5 --> 3714.26
have an open discussion that would for

3711.71 --> 3716.66
my perspective being you overcoming a

3714.26 --> 3717.1400000000003
fear obstacle because I really see it

3716.66 --> 3720.02
like that

3717.14 --> 3722.18
it's just your personal challenge this

3720.02 --> 3724.13
cowardice and it's something I think you

3722.18 --> 3726.529
could probably overcome it's really not

3724.13 --> 3729.23
that scary once you just try it out you

3726.529 --> 3731.869
know you're on the ball side things

3729.23 --> 3732.98
couldn't possibly get any Messier you

3731.869 --> 3734.6600000000003
know this

3732.98 --> 3737.81
everybody around you is totally

3734.66 --> 3739.8489999999997
spiraling out of control going semi

3737.81 --> 3742.79
psychotic what's the damage of you

3739.849 --> 3746.98
actually coming out of your safety zone

3742.79 --> 3749.9
for a moment and doing something live

3746.98 --> 3752.2
not under your control you know you can

3749.9 --> 3752.2000000000003
do it

3760.26 --> 3768.82
really mr. Fleck so mr. Fleck if I'm if

3765.91 --> 3771.79
I'm lying and being dishonest right just

3768.82 --> 3775.11
for the views so can you give me an

3771.79 --> 3780.0299999999997
example or Simon then actually got on a

3775.11 --> 3786.07
gnome by us all flat earthers panel and

3780.03 --> 3788.86
had a proper discussion and not riding

3786.07 --> 3791.65
on some other ballers platform to have a

3788.86 --> 3797.9100000000003
discussion with a flat earther when does

3791.65 --> 3797.9100000000003
that happen I've never seen that

3814.15 --> 3827.099
hmm anyway yeah it's a Saturday episode

3821.4 --> 3827.099
so I'm fine with just keeping it up

3838.53 --> 3846.4700000000003
now Nathan he knows very very little

3842.96 --> 3850.4700000000003
that's part of the the retardation is

3846.47 --> 3855.8999999999996
look all this language precision the way

3850.47 --> 3859.5299999999997
that we are basically I have to find

3855.9 --> 3861.9900000000002
that right word for it I'm gonna google

3859.53 --> 3864.2000000000003
translate it because I do know it in

3861.99 --> 3864.2
Dutch

3868.68 --> 3872.7599999999998

3877.98 --> 3887.75
okay it's not exactly what I was looking

3881.07 --> 3893.9900000000002
for I guess determine identify hmm

3887.75 --> 3893.99
anyway now I lost track of the point

3897.859 --> 3901.49
yeah sorry

3915.53 --> 3923.4500000000003
yeah no no my phone again right so Simon

3920.39 --> 3928.04
Dan is kind of dumb and I think that

3923.45 --> 3930.2799999999997
this figuring out this this mastery of

3928.04 --> 3932.99
language the technical approach

3930.28 --> 3934.4900000000002
involving this involving actual science

3932.99 --> 3940.72
and all that I think it's just they're

3934.49 --> 3944.0899999999997
difficult for him you can't handle it

3940.72 --> 3946.3399999999997
because he probably feels that if he

3944.09 --> 3949.82
would allow himself to get real

3946.34 --> 3951.8
concerning all that that his ball dream

3949.82 --> 3957.31
and all's ambitions that tie into are

3951.8 --> 3959.9300000000003
just going out the door immediately so

3957.31 --> 3963.35
but if he would want to get it it would

3959.93 --> 3969.98
take full concentration because he's not

3963.35 --> 3971.72
really that smart so until he can find

3969.98 --> 3972.59
some way through to allow it and it's

3971.72 --> 3976.49
never gonna happen

3972.59 --> 3979.4
yeah he can't even understand the basics

3976.49 --> 3982.58
of it he just can't he can't accept that

3979.4 --> 3984.62
he has to go by the fictional version

3982.58 --> 3987.25
with multiple methods and everything

3984.62 --> 3987.25
being derailed

Wow well nano reef keeping the thing is

4037.43 --> 4048.9199999999996
is that ice is solid and water is liquid

4043.85 --> 4051.3199999999997
so if you're gonna presuppose that there

4048.92 --> 4053.89
is a 200 feet ice wall I don't see the

4051.32 --> 4057.59
problem with that because ice is solid

4053.89 --> 4061.37
ice will not find its level because it's

4057.59 --> 4064.6000000000004
not a liquid it used to be probably and

4061.37 --> 4074.24
then it froze up and it became a solid I

4064.6 --> 4076.1
don't well besides that I don't really

4074.24 --> 4078.79
understand even the point of the

4076.1 --> 4081.8399999999997

yeah well the funny thing about that

4102.79 --> 4108.04
Simon and I'm pretty sure about this

4105.25 --> 4110.349
can't predict this that you think you

4108.04 --> 4113.29
have a life and it's all going great and

4110.349 --> 4116.79
Nathan is well he's still doing pretty

4113.29 --> 4119.44
good he's getting by but the thing is

4116.79 --> 4121.929
there's a certain consequence of what

4119.44 --> 4125.5
we're doing and I'm pretty sure that

4121.929 --> 4128.6990000000005
Nathan like in 20 years 30 years will

4125.5 --> 4130.929
still have a family he will still be

4128.699 --> 4132.73
involving himself immediate don't know

4130.929 --> 4134.829
if you still do the show but he will

4132.73 --> 4137.1089999999995
probably be involved just because of all

4134.829 --> 4144.579
the experience and the being known and

4137.109 --> 4146.529
having skill you however to be fair I

4144.579 --> 4149.17
don't see you doing all that well in 20

4146.529 --> 4152.290000000001
or 30 years yeah you might have built up

4149.17 --> 4155.65
some money but you probably also build

4152.29 --> 4161.889
up quite some notoriety for your overall

4155.65 --> 4167.3189999999995
behavior and the way you reflect your

4161.889 --> 4171.099
beliefs and it's not gonna give you a

4167.319 --> 4172.4800000000005
lot of comfort to fall back on it's

4171.099 --> 4176.92
actually going to give you more problems

4172.48 --> 4181.449
in the outside world then it's yeah then

4176.92 --> 4183.909
advantages for Nathan it it will

4181.449 --> 4186.339
probably be like oh yeah cool Oh Nathan

4183.909 --> 4189.67
you know oh that's a guy from flat earth

4186.339 --> 4191.349
debates assignment and if they recognize

4189.67 --> 4193.4800000000005
you you're probably gonna step away

4191.349 --> 4196.4400000000005
because it'll be like oh god it's one of

4193.48 --> 4203.5
them again yeah

4196.44 --> 4204.089999999999
so you'll see you'll see Oh get you next

4203.5 --> 4205.43

ball is total is just breaking up its

4229.46 --> 4237.11
crackling it's like an old chocolate

4233.42 --> 4239.72

4237.11 --> 4241.61
all whitey and you know it's not edible

4241.61 --> 4247.7
away

4242.59 --> 4249.92
they know it but at the same time they

4247.7 --> 4252.739
can't really accept it so they just try

4249.92 --> 4254.75
to reroute their attention to oh you

4252.739 --> 4258.5199999999995
don't have a model you don't have all

4254.75 --> 4261.83
the things that we presuppose and then

4258.52 --> 4264.4400000000005
try to use that as a baseline to show

4261.83 --> 4270.44
how little progress we have made in

accordance to your silly standards that

4270.44 --> 4280.089999999999
a huge body of evidence huge body of

4274.52 --> 4282.92
data and peer reviewing means anything

4280.09 --> 4287.81
we're just keeping it to the nitty

4282.92 --> 4290.75
gritty what we can absolutely prove also

4287.81 --> 4292.580000000001
with the outlook that more information

4290.75 --> 4294.32
may come and it may take some time to

4292.58 --> 4296.57
figure it out that's the difference so

4294.32 --> 4301.099999999999
yeah we don't have a wide body of

4296.57 --> 4303.23
evidence that we lay claims with but the

4301.1 --> 4305.81
body that we do have that we lay claims

4303.23 --> 4309.799999999999
with are pretty functional they're

4305.81 --> 4312.38
pretty you can't really break it up you

4309.8 --> 4314.54
can try to falsify the the claims we

4312.38 --> 4317.51
made but it's not gonna work out because

4314.54 --> 4319.16
they're correct that's the difference

4317.51 --> 4321.35
and that's the difference with all these

4319.16 --> 4323.3
preponderance of supposed evidence on

4321.35 --> 4325.1
the ball side all these tall tale

4323.3 --> 4327.35
stories but when you actually try to

4325.1 --> 4330.2300000000005
challenge them to prove it to provide

4327.35 --> 4332.33
the evidence for the claim there's just

4330.23 --> 4335.33
a lot of turning things around and then

4332.33 --> 4340.5199999999995
trying to force the one challenging

4335.33 --> 4343.37
their claims to provide the evidence for

4340.52 --> 4344.84
them instead of day providing the

4343.37 --> 4347.09
evidence for their claims and this is

4344.84 --> 4350.53
widely going on it's a standard its

4347.09 --> 4350.53
default strategy now

4359.719 --> 4367.02
yeah but yeah

4365.219 --> 4369.09
I don't know if you're a real ball

4367.02 --> 4373.13
believer you must have some real trouble

4369.09 --> 4375.389
it's I can't imagine it pretty well and

4373.13 --> 4377.28
probably sense it a little as well

4375.389 --> 4379.38
because ballers think that they're all

4377.28 --> 4382.409
secure in their own little image but I

4379.38 --> 4384.63
can actually tap a little into that and

4382.409 --> 4388.58
see what they actually feel within their

4384.63 --> 4392.9400000000005
belief and I think that a lot of ballers

4388.58 --> 4395.07
the ones that cannot blind themselves

4392.94 --> 4397.7699999999995
sufficiently do really regard the whole

4395.07 --> 4400.5
globe situation is like that's good old

4397.77 --> 4402.719
grandpa the great storyteller we don't

4400.5 --> 4406.469
want to lose him but his health is going

4402.719 --> 4409.29
down that's what it feels like I think

4406.469 --> 4412.2300000000005
for a lot of ballers it's a sad time

4409.29 --> 4414.7699999999995
really for ballers because his good old

4412.23 --> 4419.839999999999
grandpa you know yeah he was a bit kooky

4414.77 --> 4423.330000000001
it's a bit silly but he had some amazing

4419.84 --> 4426.03
dreamy stories and you don't really want

4423.33 --> 4428.79
to lose him but you know he's gonna go

4426.03 --> 4431.4
because there's only one way it can go

4428.79 --> 4435.179
and that's the ball that's that's your a

4431.4 --> 4437.73
ball it's getting old it's it's

4435.179 --> 4439.969
faltering it's it's it's probably gonna

4437.73 --> 4442.968999999999
die in the not-too-distant future it's

4439.969 --> 4442.969
sad

4449.499 --> 4456.34
for you that is and on the other hand it

4453.489 --> 4463.03
is kind of sad for everyone that has

4456.34 --> 4464.9490000000005
believed it in a way from the

4463.03 --> 4468.518999999999
perspective of those moments that they

4464.949 --> 4470.949
did believe it and enjoyed it but I

4468.519 --> 4473.650000000001
don't think that the necessity of the

4470.949 --> 4477.669999999999
belief of it to be real is essential for

4473.65 --> 4479.829
it to continue existing necessarily

4477.67 --> 4484.57
because as I said I think that science

4479.829 --> 4487.329
fiction is a really good storytelling

4484.57 --> 4492.219
medium it is fictional indeed so it's

4487.329 --> 4497.889
fantasy related things but we can live

4492.219 --> 4500.349
with that it's actually yeah it's like

4497.889 --> 4504.01
good toys it's like Legos you could keep

4500.349 --> 4506.1900000000005
on using it I used to play Legos part of

4504.01 --> 4511.479
those Legos were from my big brother and

4506.19 --> 4515.379999999999
I still have some of it and but my

4511.479 --> 4518.26
brother got kids and I gave the biggest

4515.38 --> 4520.119
amount of Legos that I used to have gave

4518.26 --> 4522.280000000001
it to him because you can keep on doing

4520.119 --> 4525.719
it because it's a great toy I think of

4522.28 --> 4527.559
the heliocentric fantasy space

4525.719 --> 4529.449
conceptualization and science fiction

4527.559 --> 4533.229
and all that I think it's like that it's

4529.449 --> 4537.36
just a great toy for the imagination but

4533.229 --> 4537.360000000001
you don't need to believe it is real

4537.599 --> 4544.179
it's not good for you actually to

4541.51 --> 4546.579000000001
believe it is really it distracts you

4544.179 --> 4548.289
from things that are more important the

4546.579 --> 4553.179
real-life issues that you're dealing

4548.289 --> 4555.46
with and the challenges that you bump

4553.179 --> 4558.869
into your life challenges that are

4555.46 --> 4561.789
obviously for most people very tough and

4558.869 --> 4563.679
if you believe false things to be real

4561.789 --> 4565.829
like the heliocentric model under there

4563.679 --> 4570.4
is no God and all these things all this

4565.829 --> 4574.78
reversed world denial stuff that is that

4570.4 --> 4577.17
yeah at the core of the overarching cult

4574.78 --> 4579.69
of it all

4577.17 --> 4581.25
because it is much wider than just the

4579.69 --> 4584.7
globe the gloves just at the core of it

4581.25 --> 4588.14
it's just the central part of the hole

4584.7 --> 4588.139999999999
called belief system

4593.699 --> 4598.29
and that called belief system is just a

4595.92 --> 4601.86
mental problem for a lot of people it is

4598.29 --> 4604.44
escapism weaponized escapism in a way

4601.86 --> 4607.41
that is kind of what it is it's a

4604.44 --> 4609.719
control tool it's escapism people use it

4607.41 --> 4612.63
as a comfort zone to escape from reality

4609.719 --> 4614.91
and as they do it more and more

4612.63 --> 4616.71
so does reality become harsher and

4614.91 --> 4619.5599999999995
harsher because people don't respond

4616.71 --> 4622.17
because of their ability to escape the

4619.56 --> 4624.6
stress and prevent themselves from

4622.17 --> 4626.88
reacting and that's the problem about

4624.6 --> 4630.21
escapism and about believing things that

4626.88 --> 4634.5
are absolutely not real but the more you

4630.21 --> 4638.13
disbelieve things that are not real the

4634.5 --> 4640.739
better your judgment becomes when you

4638.13 --> 4644.82
actually deal with things it really does

4640.739 --> 4648.239
you are just more sensible you know what

4644.82 --> 4651.92
to prioritize better if you get more and

4648.239 --> 4651.919999999999
more mistakes out of the way

4653.96 --> 4660.71
[Music]

4665.52 --> 4669.759
[Music]

4670.21 --> 4676.13
yes absolutely

4673.49 --> 4679.94
Emperor Palpatine that's absolutely what

4676.13 --> 4681.47
I think scientists people if they're

4679.94 --> 4684.53
real if they're actually applying

4681.47 --> 4686.51
scientific method and finding empirical

4684.53 --> 4690.259999999999
evidence for claims whatever they're

4686.51 --> 4692.33
claiming should absolutely be open to

4690.26 --> 4694.1900000000005
the idea of the earth being something

4692.33 --> 4699.62
else than the globe that is presupposed

4694.19 --> 4701.69
and then figure it out it is in my

4699.62 --> 4705.55
personal opinion really a requirement if

4701.69 --> 4708.2
you even want to be a serious scientist

4705.55 --> 4710.21
you got to face the delusions

4708.2 --> 4713.929999999999
you got to oppose the delusions that

4710.21 --> 4716.17
have enthralled the world you got to get

4713.93 --> 4716.17
real

4723.949 --> 4735.169999999999
What did he say I was just repeating the

4730.1 --> 4737.3
same [ __ ] over and over again okay so I

4735.17 --> 4739.79
meant then once somebody else to do

4737.3 --> 4744.320000000001
something surprise surprise

4739.79 --> 4749.199
oh he's now parroting that Nathan must

4744.32 --> 4752.54
make a polygraph test because of what

4749.199 --> 4757.639999999999
why don't you do a polygraph test Simon

4752.54 --> 4759.71
then why don't you well you're never

4757.64 --> 4762.35
gonna do that anyway or not without

4759.71 --> 4765.25
rigging it probably learn how to do that

4762.35 --> 4770.150000000001
you would be the type to learn that but

4765.25 --> 4773.23
if you're not even gonna go on a a panel

4770.15 --> 4778.129999999999
that is not politicized in your favor

4773.23 --> 4782.15
then why would anybody else do anything

4778.13 --> 4786.02
you're presupposing you know who cares

4782.15 --> 4788.83
what a sniveling coward has to say that

4786.02 --> 4791.21
just runs away time and time again or

4788.83 --> 4793.969
trolls people never really actually

4791.21 --> 4797.42
confronts them always deviates always

4793.969 --> 4800.15
goes away why would anybody care what

4797.42 --> 4805.01
they say because if you try to exception

4800.15 --> 4807.23
some challenge even Oh going with it we

4805.01 --> 4809.84
all know you're gonna step out at the

4807.23 --> 4811.58
last minute and then declare victory not

4809.84 --> 4814.1
because you've won an argument but

4811.58 --> 4816.89
because you wasted somebody's time and

4814.1 --> 4818.9890000000005
they feel stupid about it and then you

4816.89 --> 4823.51
think that that is a win because that's

4818.989 --> 4823.509999999999
the type that you are Simon then

4828.33 --> 4833.32
hmm I was sorry Giulio Padua and I

4831.46 --> 4838.02
forgot to shout out the super chat did I

4833.32 --> 4842.94
miss one earlier sorry about that just

4838.02 --> 4845.35
too much into the into the monologue

4842.94 --> 4848.08
anyway Giulio Pepin thank you for this

4845.35 --> 4849.88
$2 super chair donation we aren't

4848.08 --> 4852.0
shouting out super chest today yes we

4849.88 --> 4852.0
are

4864.28 --> 4870.719999999999
all right Omar color its default

4867.1 --> 4874.660000000001
strategy it's the it's the 90-84 method

4870.72 --> 4877.3
if you don't want to do something like

4874.66 --> 4880.24
for example answer questions what you do

4877.3 --> 4882.34
is you start accusing everyone of

4880.24 --> 4884.53
refusing to answer your questions and

4882.34 --> 4887.53
that way if you ignore somebody else's

4884.53 --> 4892.48
question it would seem because of

4887.53 --> 4895.66
superficial effects that it's not really

4892.48 --> 4897.459999999999
relevant what others are it it bends the

4895.66 --> 4899.44
attention away it is really mental

4897.46 --> 4901.78
manipulation and it's the default

4899.44 --> 4904.299999999999
strategies you don't have to be smart to

4901.78 --> 4907.0
even do it you just have to learn the

4904.3 --> 4916.89
trick like a little monkey that doesn't

4907.0 --> 4916.89
give a [ __ ] hey Nathan

4918.8 --> 4921.6990000000005
it's Saturday

4931.349 --> 4934.28
okay

4943.809 --> 4949.42
yeah frak to escape I prefer to call him

4947.26 --> 4956.4890000000005
side chat Dan because that's the only

4949.42 --> 4956.4890000000005
place he ever appears that side chat Dan

4971.58 --> 4979.43
oh wait is simon and actually taking a

4975.39 --> 4979.43
challenge that's funny

4987.379 --> 4992.55
yeah Hagrid wells you can do that but

4990.78 --> 4996.499
it's not very effective if you're just

4992.55 --> 4998.789
gonna point straight at the opposer

4996.499 --> 5002.269
that's never effective you know you

4998.789 --> 5004.728999999999
always when you do that you only enhance

5002.269 --> 5007.129
the side and what you're pointing and if

5004.729 --> 5009.05
by calling him side chat then I'm

5007.129 --> 5012.489
actually pointing at a fundamental

5009.05 --> 5016.599
problem with his character and therefore

5012.489 --> 5019.879
exposing an opportunity for him to

5016.599 --> 5022.76
overcome the obstacle and that way you

5019.879 --> 5026.649
don't enhance the darkness you actually

5022.76 --> 5026.649
give an opportunity towards the light

5027.369 --> 5038.749
because the deeper you sank you know

5034.57 --> 5045.349
there's always a way up even though it

5038.749 --> 5047.53
just seems completely impossible so who

5045.349 --> 5047.53
knows

5050.49 --> 5056.5
Simon Dan you don't even know about

5053.05 --> 5058.51
Nathan's beliefs you know I don't think

5056.5 --> 5061.32
that Nathan really cares to share with

5058.51 --> 5065.83
the world what his beliefs are as much

5061.32 --> 5070.0199999999995
it's he doesn't have to nobody has to

5065.83 --> 5073.48
share what their beliefs are okay that's

5070.02 --> 5079.240000000001
that's not a mandatory thing people can

5073.48 --> 5082.83
keep their beliefs to themselves what

5079.24 --> 5082.83
does that got to do with a test

5089.979 --> 5096.059
lie detector what do you want to make a

5093.13 --> 5097.9890000000005
lie detector tests about his beliefs

5096.059 --> 5101.579000000001
that's just ridiculous

5097.989 --> 5105.148999999999
I don't think that even works like that

5101.579 --> 5109.53
the whole thing about a polygraph is

5105.149 --> 5113.709000000001
it's more about distinguishing between a

5109.53 --> 5115.509999999999
basic yes/no lie and when you elaborate

5113.709 --> 5118.84
when you give complex answers that are

5115.51 --> 5121.659000000001
not just yes/no it becomes more complex

5118.84 --> 5123.639
so it's not that simple I get the

5121.659 --> 5127.449
feeling you don't actually know what

5123.639 --> 5129.099
polygraph tests are Simon dan do you

5127.449 --> 5132.909
know what they are how it actually works

5129.099 --> 5135.610000000001
what it does how it's supposed is how

5132.909 --> 5137.709
the effect the test is supposed to work

5135.61 --> 5140.11
the different results and the

5137.709 --> 5142.688999999999
conclusions you can draw from them do

5140.11 --> 5144.898999999999
you know what a polygraph test is Simon

5142.689 --> 5144.899
then

5160.719 --> 5167.08
that's okay you spoke to a company that

5164.23 --> 5173.0199999999995
has a polygraph test cool that's not

5167.08 --> 5175.84
really giving me any evidence that you

5173.02 --> 5181.75
actually know what it is just tells me

5175.84 --> 5183.969
you have availability to a device but do

5181.75 --> 5186.28
you know what it actually does do you

5183.969 --> 5195.76
understand what it is that was my

5186.28 --> 5199.96
question but you're happy to apply this

5195.76 --> 5202.900000000001
ad for this device on somebody you know

5199.96 --> 5204.85
but I just wonder if you even know what

5202.9 --> 5207.879999999999
it is or did you just hear the

5204.85 --> 5213.01
superficial rumor about it and then drew

5207.88 --> 5215.01
very poor founded conclusions so now I'm

5213.01 --> 5218.76
testing you do you actually know what a

5215.01 --> 5218.76
lie-detector test is

5234.78 --> 5259.08
Wow seem so silent all of a sudden oh by

5254.8 --> 5262.0
the way I am open for guests I have the

5259.08 --> 5266.17
the panel set up yesterday as you all

5262.0 --> 5274.66
remember so if anybody else wants to

5266.17 --> 5278.58
join me yeah Hagrid wells you don't

5274.66 --> 5285.3099999999995
really get me nervous okay

5278.58 --> 5287.85
you're just being I don't know rude at

5285.31 --> 5294.34
times especially with your comments and

5287.85 --> 5297.450000000001
just saying things that just show you

5294.34 --> 5301.6900000000005
don't really get what's happening

5297.45 --> 5306.99
because those are not things should be

5301.69 --> 5306.99
talking about like that it's just I

5307.41 --> 5310.87
don't know maybe you're just going

5309.46 --> 5313.16
through a rough time or something I

5310.87 --> 5314.53
don't know what it is

5313.16 --> 5319.0199999999995
[Music]

5314.53 --> 5319.0199999999995
what okay

5323.13 --> 5344.55
okay okay it's a premiere all right

5341.65 --> 5344.549999999999
okay that's fine

5347.78 --> 5356.48
I should probably just round out the

5349.61 --> 5357.16
show anyway whoa okay Hagrid that's not

5356.48 --> 5361.54
good

5357.16 --> 5361.54
hope that works out

5372.71 --> 5379.409
nobody timed him out right because I put

5377.639 --> 5382.409000000001
down the question about the polygraph

5379.409 --> 5387.98
test and since then sadly Simon danced

5382.409 --> 5387.98
I've stopped commenting what's going on

5390.679 --> 5395.6990000000005
was I completely right about my

5393.36 --> 5398.489
assertions of him not understanding what

5395.699 --> 5401.19
a polygraph test is and he was just

5398.489 --> 5404.009999999999
wielding the colloquial super version

5401.19 --> 5406.739
understanding of it in some weird

5404.01 --> 5411.780000000001
attempt to try to push people around

5406.739 --> 5415.29
that he considers his opponent he's

5411.78 --> 5419.33
googling it right now I bet he is I'm

5415.29 --> 5423.75
just I'm just baffled that ballers will

5419.33 --> 5428.159
drag in things in their argumentation

5423.75 --> 5431.28
and that every time we catch them on

5428.159 --> 5433.049999999999
something and then they afterward after

5431.28 --> 5435.54
they did all the things with it

5433.05 --> 5438.84
then only start researching as to what

5435.54 --> 5441.449
it is it is so stupid I don't get it why

5438.84 --> 5443.429
they don't just research these things

5441.449 --> 5447.78
like okay maybe we need to double check

5443.429 --> 5450.75
on this before we're gonna use it no how

5447.78 --> 5454.92
many ballers do that how many ballers

5450.75 --> 5459.75
have we caught actually just not knowing

5454.92 --> 5462.889
the actual details of the claims they're

5459.75 --> 5465.42
making or the thing they're saying just

5462.889 --> 5469.1990000000005
like they'd never looked it up it's

5465.42 --> 5471.0
crazy like how many times do you have to

5469.199 --> 5473.82
look something up before you really

5471.0 --> 5476.52
start to get it remember the content

5473.82 --> 5478.65
because I don't even have an interest in

5476.52 --> 5482.909000000001
remembering all of these details as much

5478.65 --> 5486.0
but still just by sheer exposure I start

5482.909 --> 5489.0599999999995
to learn them why don't they they have

5486.0 --> 5492.449
the personal necessity though - why

5489.06 --> 5497.360000000001
don't they just study up on the things

5492.449 --> 5497.36
they're gonna use I don't get it

5500.13 --> 5507.31
anyway I'm gonna round out the show it

5503.35 --> 5509.650000000001
