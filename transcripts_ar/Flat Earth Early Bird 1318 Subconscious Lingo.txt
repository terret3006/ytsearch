what can i say about yesterday's show

255.28 --> 258.239
is what it is

258.72 --> 262.079
was all quite honest

262.4 --> 268.71999999999997
but yes expected like the comment

265.04 --> 270.47900000000004
section was just riddled with at homes

268.72 --> 273.04
all trolls

270.479 --> 273.03999999999996
all of it

273.759 --> 277.36
and so just i'm just turning the

275.36 --> 281.16
comments so

277.36 --> 281.16
i'm done with that [ __ ]

282.72 --> 286.16
i guess it wasn't meant to be

290.29 --> 294.40000000000003
[Music]

292.4 --> 296.88
it's a video where sean hawkins talks

294.4 --> 298.88
about pg scene what

296.88 --> 302.08
really sean hawkins is making videos

298.88 --> 306.12
about psc net now

302.08 --> 306.12
what the hell okay

339.84 --> 345.28
yeah i got lots of feedback yesterday

342.8 --> 347.199
i mean i got plenty of feedback from you

345.28 --> 349.28
guys in the chat even

347.199 --> 351.12
right

349.28 --> 353.59999999999997
and the last part of the show was even

351.12 --> 357.44
kind of good

353.6 --> 359.36
but yeah i just i i just don't want to

357.44 --> 361.759
deal with these

359.36 --> 364.56
at homing scumbags anymore i just don't

361.759 --> 364.56
want to deal with it

365.44 --> 370.479
and since they're always coming back in

367.52 --> 373.12
the frame freaking comments every time

370.479 --> 374.4
i'm i'm just done with it i mean if

373.12 --> 376.96
there would have been

374.4 --> 378.96
like regular plenty comments that are

376.96 --> 382.15999999999997
interesting

378.96 --> 384.88
if they'd stick around

382.16 --> 387.91900000000004
then yeah i'd keep it open but

384.88 --> 390.0
it's like maybe one time every week

387.919 --> 393.52
one comment that's kind of interesting

390.0 --> 397.12
and the rest is all troll [ __ ] all of it

393.52 --> 397.12
i'm done i'm just done with it

397.28 --> 400.46999999999997
[Music]

405.6 --> 408.59000000000003
yeah thank you peaches

407.28 --> 411.77
yeah

408.59 --> 411.77
[Music]

419.84 --> 424.23999999999995
that's all

420.84 --> 426.96
right i mean i don't want you to remove

424.24 --> 429.28000000000003
things so i don't bump into them

426.96 --> 431.28
right

429.28 --> 432.88
that's yeah it's

431.28 --> 435.64
that's not what the wrenches are really

432.88 --> 438.76
for

435.64 --> 438.76
[Music]

439.199 --> 444.0
but i'm just turning it off at least for

441.36 --> 447.319
now we'll see

444.0 --> 447.319
oh jarvis

451.84 --> 456.79999999999995
what's with the advertisement

454.479 --> 456.8
yeah

456.88 --> 460.4
yeah that

458.4 --> 462.4
well jarvis i'm not the only one right

460.4 --> 465.67999999999995
that thing has been going around for a

462.4 --> 468.87899999999996
long time

465.68 --> 472.40000000000003
it's not it one guy it's a bot and it's

468.879 --> 472.40000000000003
like all kinds of accounts

474.96 --> 478.71999999999997
but it's just a standard ad bot very

477.68 --> 482.0
annoying

478.72 --> 483.759
it's been on like in my comment sections

482.0 --> 487.599
now for

483.759 --> 487.599
like at least two months straight

488.08 --> 492.28
weird no not really

492.319 --> 496.879
it's not the first time something like

493.84 --> 496.87899999999996
that has happened

499.44 --> 503.199
i mean check out the comment section

502.0 --> 506.56
sections

503.199 --> 509.039
that still have comment activity

506.56 --> 510.4
of most flat earthers

509.039 --> 511.52
that we know like the flat earth

510.4 --> 514.56
debaters

511.52 --> 514.56
they all get this

514.719 --> 519.599
but for some reason somebody just really

517.36 --> 521.839
likes to report that to my comment

519.599 --> 521.839
section

522.959 --> 527.279
because i get multiple of them like

525.04 --> 529.92
every day

527.279 --> 529.92
and yeah i

531.279 --> 535.3
usually they can get like or held back

534.399 --> 536.64
even by the

535.3 --> 540.16
[Music]

536.64 --> 542.08
yeah the automated moderating system

540.16 --> 544.0
and then i delete them but some still

542.08 --> 545.839
just slip through anyway

544.0 --> 547.92
anyway it's not going to be a problem

545.839 --> 550.1600000000001
anymore because i'm just turning it off

547.92 --> 550.16
now

552.16 --> 555.04
what's the temperature

560.0 --> 563.839
23 degrees celsius all right

568.88 --> 572.279
fresh area

596.64 --> 601.8389999999999
did an attempt to get you no no no no

600.56 --> 605.76
no it's

601.839 --> 607.9200000000001
it's just spam this is just ad spam

605.76 --> 609.2
nobody's gonna ban their channel because

607.92 --> 611.1999999999999
of that

609.2 --> 613.6
i mean

611.2 --> 615.9200000000001
that channel does never really get

613.6 --> 617.6
banned because of comments that other

615.92 --> 619.12
people make

617.6 --> 622.12
on their channel that just doesn't

619.12 --> 622.12
happen

632.72 --> 636.64
oh okay george stanford what

637.76 --> 640.64
that's new to me

643.6 --> 648.32
convicted of what

645.519 --> 648.32
george stanford

655.2 --> 660.32
then how do you know i mean

658.079 --> 663.5999999999999
like unless you're act absolutely

660.32 --> 668.839
certain i prefer you wouldn't like

663.6 --> 668.839
spread slanderous rumors around

677.839 --> 680.0790000000001
what

683.12 --> 686.72
okay

684.16 --> 689.279
okay i'm just saying in general i

686.72 --> 692.0
thought like usually you don't

689.279 --> 693.76
do that so

692.0 --> 696.0
ugh

693.76 --> 696.0
that's

696.88 --> 703.8389999999999
great another thing that just

699.839 --> 703.839
makes him even more repulsive

707.33 --> 710.5490000000001
[Music]

715.84 --> 719.019
[Music]

727.68 --> 732.7199999999999
okay george sanford fine thanks for

730.399 --> 734.639
informing me i guess although i don't

732.72 --> 736.9590000000001
know what i'm gonna do with that

734.639 --> 736.9590000000001
i mean

739.36 --> 743.839
like what's the point

742.32 --> 746.5600000000001
what am i supposed to do with that

743.839 --> 746.5600000000001
information

756.639 --> 760.399
i mean look

758.639 --> 763.76
in a way i can't

760.399 --> 763.76
truly be surprised

765.6 --> 771.9590000000001
considering

767.12 --> 771.9590000000001
what i've already analyzed about him

772.079 --> 776.2399999999999
i mean maybe it was just really hopeful

774.32 --> 779.36
that he

776.24 --> 782.36
could keep himself together somehow so

779.36 --> 782.36
yes

813.2 --> 818.24
right anyway

815.12 --> 820.48
yesterday's flat earth debates was very

818.24 --> 823.519
interesting

820.48 --> 823.519
it was a bit rowdy

823.68 --> 827.4399999999999
it got a little annoying too

826.079 --> 829.519
just

827.44 --> 833.1990000000001
just too much energy in the air also

829.519 --> 836.639
from my side but i i was pretty focused

833.199 --> 836.639
and i tried to basically

839.199 --> 844.56
reason out have conjecture over the

842.32 --> 846.88
nature of volcanoes

844.56 --> 849.5999999999999
and just the details that would surround

846.88 --> 852.0
them within the realm

849.6 --> 853.279
through logical inference

852.0 --> 855.519
and

853.279 --> 858.72
like the guys were just like

855.519 --> 859.68
screwing around with me

858.72 --> 861.6
i mean

859.68 --> 863.279
to me it wasn't just a very serious

861.6 --> 865.12
piece of speculation

863.279 --> 867.4399999999999
and i did get even some positive

865.12 --> 869.519
feedback from daislo who did actually

867.44 --> 872.0
get my point

869.519 --> 874.88
the rest was just like kind of straw

872.0 --> 877.199
manning we with like uh basically it's

874.88 --> 879.76
not scientific or like we don't really

877.199 --> 883.04
know so it's

879.76 --> 885.199
to claim that this is like

883.04 --> 887.199
logical

885.199 --> 890.24
is pointless that sort of thing very

887.199 --> 892.7199999999999
nihilistic it was interesting how daislo

890.24 --> 895.279
basically rolled into that

892.72 --> 898.0
it was overall an extremely interesting

895.279 --> 901.92
show after show especially and it was uh

898.0 --> 901.92
yeah very long after show too

904.32 --> 911.0790000000001
the guys are just like making it really

907.04 --> 911.079
tiresome for me sometimes

913.76 --> 918.16
but overall

915.199 --> 921.04
despite all that still interesting what

918.16 --> 923.6
i talked about about lava

921.04 --> 926.48
how is it formed

923.6 --> 929.9200000000001
if there's lava coming out of volcanoes

926.48 --> 932.0790000000001
does that actually make the land sink

929.92 --> 934.079
like measurably

932.079 --> 936.4799999999999
and you could argue okay so the sediment

934.079 --> 938.16
is then building up on the outside

936.48 --> 940.0790000000001
through the lava

938.16 --> 942.48
but the land sinks and that should even

940.079 --> 946.4799999999999
out and then however lava is being

942.48 --> 948.639
formed it might simply start melting

946.48 --> 950.5600000000001
the local sediment

948.639 --> 952.0
back into lava and then the process

950.56 --> 954.2399999999999
repeats

952.0 --> 956.079
right and then there's a cyclical nature

954.24 --> 958.32
but it just

956.079 --> 959.92
all that was in my mind i'm trying to

958.32 --> 963.44
puzzle it out

959.92 --> 966.24
and just it never got rolling everybody

963.44 --> 970.1600000000001
just adam meek and started joking about

966.24 --> 973.36
polonium people again like

970.16 --> 977.36
it was kind of untenable

973.36 --> 977.36
but still very interesting

980.0 --> 984.48
fed don't really take me serious anymore

982.079 --> 987.12
well that's some that's what i feel like

984.48 --> 988.6
sometimes and i don't understand

987.12 --> 991.799
i don't understand why

988.6 --> 991.799
[Music]

992.88 --> 998.72
i mean i'm very serious on that show

996.079 --> 1000.399
like even when i do ballwin i'm very

998.72 --> 1001.36
serious

1000.399 --> 1003.759
and

1001.36 --> 1006.24
yeah maybe they just don't want that

1003.759 --> 1010.04
right now or something

1006.24 --> 1010.04
i don't know what it is

1014.72 --> 1020.399
but hey if it comes out that somehow

1018.079 --> 1023.04
the way i conduct myself

1020.399 --> 1024.88
causes them to not take me serious

1023.04 --> 1026.959
anymore

1024.88 --> 1030.24
then it has to come out of them and then

1026.959 --> 1030.24
i'll say my goodbyes

1031.76 --> 1036.079
then they can just keep on doing what

1033.52 --> 1038.48
they do on their own

1036.079 --> 1040.1599999999999
without an arwyn to point out brilliant

1038.48 --> 1044.28
things for them

1040.16 --> 1044.28
when they least expect it

1056.24 --> 1061.44
so yeah i hope it's just a temporary

1058.799 --> 1061.44
mood thing

1063.12 --> 1068.7199999999998
because yeah if that's gonna be like the

1065.84 --> 1073.24
standard then yeah i'm not gonna be the

1068.72 --> 1073.24
pariah in the group i refuse

1081.52 --> 1087.36
well that face

1083.039 --> 1088.32
yeah well maybe i will then but at face

1087.36 --> 1090.9599999999998
look

1088.32 --> 1093.28
it is the interaction between all of us

1090.96 --> 1094.64
that really gives me the opportunity to

1093.28 --> 1096.6399999999999
do what i do

1094.64 --> 1099.2
doesn't work the same when it's just me

1096.64 --> 1099.2
on my own

1099.52 --> 1104.4
or people interacting with people in

1101.6 --> 1106.559
chat right so they have very high level

1104.4 --> 1110.0
thinking conversations

1106.559 --> 1112.24
that stimulates me to have high level

1110.0 --> 1114.48
thinking based inquiry

1112.24 --> 1116.559
with people around me that are gonna

1114.48 --> 1118.72
test that and i like that i like that

1116.559 --> 1119.44
they test it what i don't like is that

1118.72 --> 1123.039
they

1119.44 --> 1125.2
yeah start making jokes

1123.039 --> 1128.72
when i'm trying to be serious that part

1125.2 --> 1128.72
i do not like at all

1131.28 --> 1135.08
hello fiber oats

1144.799 --> 1149.96
bald heart to go [ __ ] off

1146.96 --> 1149.96
okay

1150.16 --> 1156.0
we're giving who gave you a timeout like

1153.2 --> 1158.0800000000002
paula or something i mean paula is very

1156.0 --> 1161.32
low threshold with

1158.08 --> 1161.32
her moderating

1164.88 --> 1168.4
i mean if she is going to be in chat you

1166.72 --> 1169.679
got to be careful with what you're going

1168.4 --> 1173.2800000000002
to say

1169.679 --> 1173.2800000000002
it's really that simple jarrod

1173.52 --> 1179.51
i i didn't make up the rules

1176.37 --> 1179.51
[Music]

1189.12 --> 1193.6789999999999
yeah i know that's right i know because

1191.52 --> 1195.6
it's that's always her she's always

1193.679 --> 1198.4
doing that

1195.6 --> 1200.8799999999999
territ i know droid is awesome he would

1198.4 --> 1203.679
never do that but it again

1200.88 --> 1205.1200000000001
you gotta be careful territ i know

1203.679 --> 1208.88
you're very

1205.12 --> 1210.7199999999998
a kind of off the handle passionate guy

1208.88 --> 1213.3600000000001
with brains

1210.72 --> 1214.64
but you just gotta realize that certain

1213.36 --> 1217.6789999999999
people

1214.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
when they're in the chat you just can't

1217.679 --> 1221.8400000000001
let yourself go like that

1221.919 --> 1225.88
just it's not gonna work

1234.4 --> 1240.88
fight me

1235.919 --> 1240.88
some of them here to talk about it

1241.14 --> 1245.96
[Music]

1242.96 --> 1245.96
no

1250.08 --> 1255.9189999999999
no i'll talk about it on fed

1253.84 --> 1259.6399999999999
that's where it's happening that's where

1255.919 --> 1259.64
i'll talk about it

1264.4 --> 1268.5590000000002
this was your first time at once

1267.039 --> 1271.52
wow

1268.559 --> 1271.52
rationing your

1272.88 --> 1276.64
your extreme moods are you

1279.52 --> 1283.32
by the way an aliasg

1292.08 --> 1296.0
i'll get more viewers when i invite them

1294.64 --> 1297.679
here

1296.0 --> 1299.84
well look

1297.679 --> 1302.3200000000002
first off they gotta actually have time

1299.84 --> 1302.32
for that

1303.6 --> 1308.84
and do they really want to do that

1324.559 --> 1329.2
right but that's also what i was

1326.72 --> 1332.88
basically shouting about yesterday

1329.2 --> 1335.52
that's just this freaking time slot

1332.88 --> 1338.48
this time slot seems to be working just

1335.52 --> 1340.48
for me for me in particular

1338.48 --> 1343.64
not a lot of other people out there that

1340.48 --> 1343.64
are streaming

1357.039 --> 1361.6
well this is not the last show if you

1359.039 --> 1362.72
watched the end of yesterday's show you

1361.6 --> 1365.7199999999998
know that

1362.72 --> 1365.72
bastion

1380.32 --> 1384.76
but anyway look at face

1396.4 --> 1399.2
look the thing is

1399.6 --> 1404.559
when i started the early word show i was

1402.48 --> 1405.679
like really wanting to have other people

1404.559 --> 1408.1589999999999
on

1405.679 --> 1409.2
or conversational interactions and all

1408.159 --> 1410.72
that

1409.2 --> 1412.159
well

1410.72 --> 1414.88
technically

1412.159 --> 1418.96
i i don't really need that anymore

1414.88 --> 1420.24
because i got a much more rich

1418.96 --> 1421.76
chat now

1420.24 --> 1424.72
and i'm very

1421.76 --> 1427.2
i'm very well able to interact with the

1424.72 --> 1429.6000000000001
chat and achieve the same thing

1427.2 --> 1432.0
much more efficiently without any

1429.6 --> 1434.3999999999999
accidental rom-passing

1432.0 --> 1436.0
which i find very disturbing and

1434.4 --> 1437.3600000000001
distorting

1436.0 --> 1441.679
when that happens

1437.36 --> 1445.6399999999999
so i actually just prefer this setup

1441.679 --> 1445.64
interacting through chat

1450.96 --> 1455.6000000000001
you're mistreating me no

1454.0 --> 1457.52
no but that's not really how i'm

1455.6 --> 1460.0
thinking about it look if if they're

1457.52 --> 1461.039
going too far with something i speak up

1460.0 --> 1464.32
about it

1461.039 --> 1466.4
and i did i always do i immediately said

1464.32 --> 1470.559
just like this is bad why are you doing

1466.4 --> 1470.5590000000002
this and i didn't even tell like

1472.0 --> 1475.279
adam yesterday like why are you

1474.08 --> 1477.36
constantly

1475.279 --> 1480.4
bringing up polonium people

1477.36 --> 1480.3999999999999
this is not funny

1482.799 --> 1486.72
right so

1484.08 --> 1488.48
that's that's good enough

1486.72 --> 1490.96
right there's no

1488.48 --> 1494.48
brooding problem like that it's just

1490.96 --> 1497.44
that i don't really understand why

1494.48 --> 1497.44
why the attitude

1497.679 --> 1503.44
qe goes hard on pr dude i you we i don't

1501.279 --> 1506.72
even pay attention

1503.44 --> 1508.799
to qe's attitude towards me at all

1506.72 --> 1511.44
and i think that qe's attitude towards

1508.799 --> 1515.6399999999999
me is actually kind of respectful have

1511.44 --> 1515.64
you noticed territ

1516.08 --> 1518.3999999999999
like

1516.96 --> 1521.279
let's say

1518.4 --> 1521.279
two years ago

1521.84 --> 1525.76
he thought he genuinely thought i was

1524.32 --> 1528.32
crazy

1525.76 --> 1531.039
he didn't understand me like how the way

1528.32 --> 1533.4399999999998
that i do things and

1531.039 --> 1535.36
just the way that i am he did not get it

1533.44 --> 1538.0
dewey gets me now

1535.36 --> 1539.12
he i can feel it i can hear it in the

1538.0 --> 1541.679
way

1539.12 --> 1543.6
he talks especially when he addresses me

1541.679 --> 1545.8400000000001
directly or indirectly

1543.6 --> 1548.08
and still doesn't have a lot of patience

1545.84 --> 1550.559
for things right

1548.08 --> 1553.36
but no i think that kiwi is actually

1550.559 --> 1555.76
much more reasonable than most of the

1553.36 --> 1557.6789999999999
other guys it's just that if he's in the

1555.76 --> 1558.799
mood he doesn't want to do it then he's

1557.679 --> 1562.5590000000002
just gonna

1558.799 --> 1562.559
make noise until it stops

1563.12 --> 1565.6789999999999
that has nothing to do with me

1564.559 --> 1568.6399999999999
personally

1565.679 --> 1568.64
i know that by now

1568.799 --> 1575.039
right does that with everybody

1571.84 --> 1577.6
even nathan on his own show

1575.039 --> 1580.0
i don't really get why nathan accepts it

1577.6 --> 1583.6
as much as he does

1580.0 --> 1585.12
from kiwi but yeah that's his own issue

1583.6 --> 1587.4399999999998
it's going to find his own balance with

1585.12 --> 1587.4399999999998
that

1587.84 --> 1590.0
but

1594.32 --> 1598.96
yeah i don't see them as actually

1596.4 --> 1603.039
mistreating me this is like social group

1598.96 --> 1605.52
dynamics and i am the odd leg out type

1603.039 --> 1607.84
within a social circle i i just that

1605.52 --> 1610.4
happens to me always it's

1607.84 --> 1612.3999999999999
i don't know any other way to be

1610.4 --> 1615.76
basically because that's been the

1612.4 --> 1618.3200000000002
position that i always have been in

1615.76 --> 1620.559
since i first even had social

1618.32 --> 1623.559
interaction with other people

1620.559 --> 1623.559
always

1634.32 --> 1638.96
if it needs diversity on the panel it

1636.159 --> 1642.0
works well yeah it works fine now i'm

1638.96 --> 1646.3990000000001
not complaining look the show yesterday

1642.0 --> 1647.279
fed after show was very interesting

1646.399 --> 1648.9599999999998
and

1647.279 --> 1651.36
yes there was some annoyance yes there

1648.96 --> 1654.32
was some friction

1651.36 --> 1656.24
and i even got a bit loud but i was not

1654.32 --> 1659.52
just

1656.24 --> 1662.559
screaming or something i like the anger

1659.52 --> 1666.1589999999999
from the from my own show didn't like

1662.559 --> 1666.1589999999999
leak into fed

1667.2 --> 1672.559
i was actually very clear-minded but i

1669.52 --> 1674.48
did get a little loud and maybe that got

1672.559 --> 1677.12
onto the nerves of certain people

1674.48 --> 1678.96
perhaps and they were probably just

1677.12 --> 1680.799
trying to joke around to kind of like

1678.96 --> 1681.679
soothing the nerves but i just was like

1680.799 --> 1684.48
no

1681.679 --> 1687.039
no i'm just gonna do this

1684.48 --> 1689.2
i'm gonna make keep pushing this point

1687.039 --> 1691.27
until you understand

1689.2 --> 1693.6000000000001
and accept

1691.27 --> 1695.679
[Music]

1693.6 --> 1698.6399999999999
so i wish i guess you could even say

1695.679 --> 1702.48
that i was a bit pushy

1698.64 --> 1705.679
but then again everybody was a bit pushy

1702.48 --> 1708.48
so but yeah it was just just a great fed

1705.679 --> 1710.799
show and i can't wait to hear it back

1708.48 --> 1712.559
i really i really want to hear it back

1710.799 --> 1715.679
because it was a very interesting

1712.559 --> 1715.6789999999999
conversation i thought

1717.08 --> 1720.21
[Music]

1721.039 --> 1725.799
hello the price of adam good to see you

1725.919 --> 1733.159
child things are gonna get easier what

1729.76 --> 1733.1589999999999
what do you mean

1765.44 --> 1770.76
things are going get right what

1783.2 --> 1788.0800000000002
oh

1784.159 --> 1792.0390000000002
right yeah what adam price said okay

1788.08 --> 1792.039
i recognize it now

1797.039 --> 1800.48
hey hey thanks vibrate for the super

1799.44 --> 1803.1200000000001
chat

1800.48 --> 1806.24
keep up the good work or win

1803.12 --> 1810.08
if it hadn't been for you fed

1806.24 --> 1813.039
and fvd i'd be watching cosmos right now

1810.08 --> 1813.039
i appreciate that

1816.72 --> 1822.88
although would you really be watching

1818.799 --> 1824.72
cosmos i mean it is kind of boring

1822.88 --> 1826.3990000000001
i always thought that all that [ __ ] was

1824.72 --> 1828.64
just boring

1826.399 --> 1832.4799999999998
even when i was

1828.64 --> 1832.48
not a conscious flat earther yet

1832.88 --> 1837.6000000000001
like i liked the visuals i liked the

1835.039 --> 1841.6
ideas it's just that what they had to

1837.6 --> 1843.9189999999999
say about it was just always boring

1841.6 --> 1846.48
and like

1843.919 --> 1849.5200000000002
not updated enough it's like that's how

1846.48 --> 1852.3990000000001
it felt like this is like the very old

1849.52 --> 1855.52
stuff like there should be

1852.399 --> 1857.36
way more refined ideas out there that's

1855.52 --> 1860.08
what i was always thinking

1857.36 --> 1861.76
so even if there was no fed and the

1860.08 --> 1864.8799999999999
early bird show

1861.76 --> 1866.96
yeah would you really be watching cosmos

1864.88 --> 1868.96
or you would you only do that when

1866.96 --> 1870.64
you're like really bored and wondering

1868.96 --> 1874.72
like when are the

1870.64 --> 1874.72
finally the really interesting

1874.96 --> 1878.559
like

1875.84 --> 1880.559
actual cosmos related sci-fi stuff

1878.559 --> 1883.279
stories where is it

1880.559 --> 1884.799
not just this stupid conceptual math

1883.279 --> 1887.36
nonsense

1884.799 --> 1891.2
which is obviously [ __ ]

1887.36 --> 1893.84
like even within their presuppositional

1891.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
idea

1898.799 --> 1904.2
open white

1900.799 --> 1904.2
max vinich

1922.48 --> 1924.799
right

1925.279 --> 1930.32
by the way i had something really odd

1927.919 --> 1933.1200000000001
also

1930.32 --> 1936.72
i was checking my mail yesterday

1933.12 --> 1938.1589999999999
and in the spam mail

1936.72 --> 1941.039
i found the mail

1938.159 --> 1943.279
of somebody

1941.039 --> 1945.84
called craig so it was immediately like

1943.279 --> 1948.559
wait it's not fight to flat earth is it

1945.84 --> 1950.6399999999999
but i don't think it's him

1948.559 --> 1953.12
asking me like hey

1950.64 --> 1957.1200000000001
i wanna

1953.12 --> 1957.12
again pretty elaborate email

1961.279 --> 1964.96
he just wants to talk

1963.12 --> 1967.1999999999998
and he was very interested in my

1964.96 --> 1969.039
holistic approach

1967.2 --> 1971.919
and he actually sent me a paypal

1969.039 --> 1973.919
donation and not a small one either

1971.919 --> 1977.1200000000001
like a hundred euros or something i

1973.919 --> 1979.6000000000001
don't even know who he is still waiting

1977.12 --> 1982.32
for a reply email but that was really

1979.6 --> 1982.32
unexpected

1985.039 --> 1991.64
i'm kind of wondering like if he's gonna

1986.96 --> 1991.64
pop up in my chat or not

1991.679 --> 1998.24
but that was really a surprising

1994.64 --> 1998.24
i wonder who it really is

2003.12 --> 2010.08
hey len linux what does that mean

2007.519 --> 2012.64
did say good oh

2010.08 --> 2014.8799999999999
i'm sorry clutch hello

2012.64 --> 2017.8400000000001

2014.88 --> 2019.6000000000001
sorry if i missed you

2017.84 --> 2021.12

2019.6 --> 2023.6789999999999

2035.12 --> 2040.4799999999998
i'm still a little like a raw

2037.84 --> 2042.72
sore from yesterday because it like i

2040.48 --> 2046.159
was really stressed out i was really

2042.72 --> 2048.2400000000002
stressed out

2046.159 --> 2050.48
it's kind of a miracle that was able to

2048.24 --> 2052.0789999999997
even hold myself together as focused as

2050.48 --> 2055.28
i did on the

2052.079 --> 2055.28
fed show so

2059.52 --> 2065.359
but yeah i do i feel overall in a good

2062.399 --> 2068.359
condition just a little

2065.359 --> 2068.359
wonky

2077.04 --> 2081.119
and really interested i mean

2078.949 --> 2083.76
[Music]

2081.119 --> 2087.28
surprise donators are always very

2083.76 --> 2088.8
interesting i'm always like who is this

2087.28 --> 2091.3590000000004
i mean

2088.8 --> 2094.079
are maybe people are actually gonna take

2091.359 --> 2095.44
notice of just what i do and what i can

2094.079 --> 2097.6800000000003
do

2095.44 --> 2100.32
i mean i am

2097.68 --> 2102.3999999999996
an oracle i mean i keep saying and a lot

2100.32 --> 2105.3590000000004
of people think it's really funny or oh

2102.4 --> 2108.2400000000002
that's so computer game or oh is that a

2105.359 --> 2109.5989999999997
reference to the greek mythology

2108.24 --> 2110.56
right

2109.599 --> 2112.8
but it's

2110.56 --> 2114.96
actually a function and

2112.8 --> 2117.2000000000003
like yeah i can do that i mean do you

2114.96 --> 2119.92
even understand the potential value of

2117.2 --> 2119.9199999999996
what i can do

2121.44 --> 2127.359
i mean i have done that before

2125.04 --> 2128.839
like for example uh

2127.359 --> 2132.64
sometime

2128.839 --> 2135.92
again only sheeple can't see

2132.64 --> 2137.2799999999997
from new zealand he basically

2135.92 --> 2141.44
openly

2137.28 --> 2143.52
did that he used my oracle he he gave

2141.44 --> 2146.0
himself to me

2143.52 --> 2148.48
and i really did my best and it worked

2146.0 --> 2148.48
out great

2150.079 --> 2154.079
right and that's not something oh i have

2151.76 --> 2156.48
to prep no that's something that is like

2154.079 --> 2158.48
a spontaneous inner function i can do

2156.48 --> 2160.16
that it's the oracle it's just i get the

2158.48 --> 2162.4
right answer

2160.16 --> 2165.2
it's beyond me

2162.4 --> 2169.8
beyond my conscious

2165.2 --> 2169.7999999999997
yeah oracle that's right

2170.15 --> 2177.2000000000003
[Music]

2173.28 --> 2178.48
it's almost like a medium but it isn't a

2177.2 --> 2179.4399999999996
medium

2178.48 --> 2182.88
because

2179.44 --> 2184.839
my consciousness is not replaced

2182.88 --> 2187.119
and when i do it it's not

2184.839 --> 2188.64
compartmentalized from my consciousness

2187.119 --> 2190.0
like typical

2188.64 --> 2192.56
mediums are

2190.0 --> 2195.92
they like inter-switch personality and

2192.56 --> 2197.52
then they often don't even remember what

2195.92 --> 2201.2000000000003
they did

2197.52 --> 2203.359
i am conscious still parallel when i do

2201.2 --> 2203.359
it

2210.72 --> 2215.04
but yeah at the same time as i do it and

2213.28 --> 2217.0400000000004
my consciousness

2215.04 --> 2219.359
takes note of what comes out of me my

2217.04 --> 2221.52
consciousness is very surprised a lot

2219.359 --> 2224.72
it's like whoa

2221.52 --> 2224.72
am i saying this

2228.8 --> 2232.5600000000004
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2239.76 --> 2244.88
maybe i am a physic

2242.48 --> 2245.76
i'm a physic

2244.88 --> 2248.32
i

2245.76 --> 2250.1600000000003
am a physic

2248.32 --> 2254.599
sorry i know what you're trying to say

2250.16 --> 2254.5989999999997
but that's not how you spell that

2264.24 --> 2268.9599999999996
yeah a psychic yeah you you could think

2266.56 --> 2271.2
of me as a psychic it's just a really

2268.96 --> 2272.4
annoying word

2271.2 --> 2274.3999999999996
that's like

2272.4 --> 2277.6800000000003
that immediately turns you into a

2274.4 --> 2278.7200000000003
conspiracy number effectively

2277.68 --> 2280.8799999999997
right

2278.72 --> 2282.48
i mean just look

2280.88 --> 2284.7200000000003
out there

2282.48 --> 2286.079
at people that actually call themselves

2284.72 --> 2288.8799999999997
psychic

2286.079 --> 2291.76
look at how [ __ ] goofy and contrived

2288.88 --> 2294.4
their [ __ ] really is yeah that's not

2291.76 --> 2294.4
what i am

2294.8 --> 2300.079
i would never say it like that i think

2297.2 --> 2300.0789999999997
it's demeaning

2300.88 --> 2308.6400000000003
i mean psychic is like saying

2305.359 --> 2308.64
i'm spiritual

2310.72 --> 2316.72
like oh really you are oh that's that's

2313.839 --> 2319.92
not over generalized at all i mean that

2316.72 --> 2321.7599999999998
says everything then

2319.92 --> 2324.96
like a psychic

2321.76 --> 2327.3590000000004
to me it has the same value as declaring

2324.96 --> 2330.2400000000002
yourself a scientist

2327.359 --> 2332.7999999999997
in this current era

2330.24 --> 2335.5989999999997
like oh really you're a scientist really

2332.8 --> 2337.8390000000004
so what's the scientific method

2335.599 --> 2337.839
right

2339.28 --> 2344.96
oh so you're a psychic

2341.92 --> 2344.96
what does that mean

2345.68 --> 2350.16
what are your abilities do you know what

2347.76 --> 2351.76
it is that you're doing do you know

2350.16 --> 2353.7599999999998
how this works

2351.76 --> 2356.6400000000003
when you do it

2353.76 --> 2358.8
do you know about internal psychology

2356.64 --> 2361.359
like how much do you actually understand

2358.8 --> 2364.5600000000004
of what it is that you so easily give

2361.359 --> 2364.56
yourself a title with

2367.68 --> 2371.839
yeah no i'll just stick with oracle

2374.56 --> 2380.48
[Music]

2377.44 --> 2384.56
esp telepathy yeah but that's but to see

2380.48 --> 2384.56
that is already kind of nonsense

2386.24 --> 2390.8799999999997
but it's sort of i mean extra

2389.52 --> 2393.92
sensory

2390.88 --> 2397.28
extra sensory perception

2393.92 --> 2399.52
is just a really messy field

2397.28 --> 2402.8
but esp is

2399.52 --> 2406.0
effectively an attempt to empirically

2402.8 --> 2407.8390000000004
study the subconsciousness right so for

2406.0 --> 2410.96
example what i talked about in the last

2407.839 --> 2412.4
few days about

2410.96 --> 2413.839
the

2412.4 --> 2416.0
social

2413.839 --> 2418.64
interaction through the subconscious and

2416.0 --> 2421.359
how this has its own essence like its

2418.64 --> 2422.96
own substance morality

2421.359 --> 2425.68
how the the

2422.96 --> 2428.2400000000002
consciousness reflects upon information

2425.68 --> 2429.7599999999998
and the attitude it takes in a social

2428.24 --> 2433.4399999999996
dynamic this

2429.76 --> 2433.44
would fall under esp

2436.24 --> 2441.2
but it's not the word is almost a

2438.8 --> 2442.88
reification because extra sensory

2441.2 --> 2446.96
perception that means

2442.88 --> 2449.76
perception outside of your senses

2446.96 --> 2452.96
that's technically incorrect

2449.76 --> 2454.2400000000002
it's more like intra sensory perception

2452.96 --> 2457.44
it is

2454.24 --> 2458.7999999999997
your senses have this information and

2457.44 --> 2462.2400000000002
then there's an

2458.8 --> 2464.96
other system like a subsystem that can

2462.24 --> 2467.2
like get metadata

2464.96 --> 2469.92
out of your own senses

2467.2 --> 2474.9199999999996
that's much much more what esp really is

2469.92 --> 2474.92
about it's not esp it's isp

2475.2 --> 2479.5989999999997
right there you go and telepathy yeah

2477.44 --> 2481.839
literal telepathy doesn't exist in my

2479.599 --> 2481.839
opinion

2482.4 --> 2487.6800000000003
telepathy is

2484.079 --> 2487.6800000000003
also just like

2488.079 --> 2493.599
hyper intelligence if you understand a

2490.64 --> 2496.56
lot and how structures work and how

2493.599 --> 2498.56
things unfold you can predict the path

2496.56 --> 2501.04
of something

2498.56 --> 2503.44
way before it's there

2501.04 --> 2506.56
then you gain

2503.44 --> 2508.56
a lot of like oversight

2506.56 --> 2510.56
when you then interact with somebody

2508.56 --> 2513.04
that does not have that same level of

2510.56 --> 2516.88
oversight even about themselves

2513.04 --> 2518.8
you can effectively be telepathic but

2516.88 --> 2521.44
this is not literal telepathy this is

2518.8 --> 2524.7200000000003
not you stealing ideas from somebody's

2521.44 --> 2526.0
mind it's you being able to really

2524.72 --> 2528.56
predict

2526.0 --> 2530.24
exactly what is gonna go and happen

2528.56 --> 2532.88
inside of them

2530.24 --> 2534.7999999999997
with the logical consequence of certain

2532.88 --> 2537.04
thoughts

2534.8 --> 2538.8
that's the real telepathy that's what

2537.04 --> 2542.839
i've been doing

2538.8 --> 2542.8390000000004
it's not actual telepathy

2554.4 --> 2557.04
right so

2558.64 --> 2562.0
i'll just stick with oracle

2562.24 --> 2567.9199999999996
not psychic

2565.27 --> 2570.72
[Music]

2567.92 --> 2573.44
besides psychic sounds way too much like

2570.72 --> 2573.4399999999996
sidekick

2574.0 --> 2577.24
no thanks

2595.2 --> 2599.4399999999996
poltergeist and said because yeah

2599.76 --> 2604.6400000000003
right yeah poltergeist

2601.839 --> 2606.56
although not exclusive to

2604.64 --> 2609.44
teenage girls

2606.56 --> 2611.7599999999998
right but they when it happens

2609.44 --> 2613.68
teenage girls often have the strongest

2611.76 --> 2616.0
effects it's just because of the amount

2613.68 --> 2617.5989999999997
of tension that goes through them

2616.0 --> 2618.56
when it happens

2617.599 --> 2622.319
right

2618.56 --> 2625.839
but it's basically a poltergeist effect

2622.319 --> 2628.04
might seem like something else is doing

2625.839 --> 2630.96
something but it is basically the

2628.04 --> 2633.2799999999997
subconsciousness that is panicking

2630.96 --> 2635.839
in a way

2633.28 --> 2637.599
and polarized cut off from the

2635.839 --> 2639.2
consciousness that is not going to

2637.599 --> 2642.0
really be aware of it it's like going to

2639.2 --> 2643.5989999999997
be escaped away from it that tension in

2642.0 --> 2645.359
their mind so it's like typically in a

2643.599 --> 2647.76
tense situation

2645.359 --> 2650.72
and then

2647.76 --> 2654.079
all their energy is basically

2650.72 --> 2658.0789999999997
outside of the consciousness directed to

2654.079 --> 2659.76
do this weird telekinetic [ __ ]

2658.079 --> 2661.2000000000003
which can be pretty

2659.76 --> 2663.8390000000004
extreme

2661.2 --> 2663.839
apparently

2666.0 --> 2672.64
but i think that poltergeist are an

2669.2 --> 2674.16
effectively a side effect side energy of

2672.64 --> 2676.0789999999997
people

2674.16 --> 2677.68
and not under their conscious control

2676.079 --> 2679.6800000000003
that's always the thing about it's

2677.68 --> 2681.839
always

2679.68 --> 2684.319
like if anything if there is seems to be

2681.839 --> 2686.0789999999997
a correlation between the consciousness

2684.319 --> 2688.88
what they think or how they act and the

2686.079 --> 2693.6800000000003
activity then it's always in opposition

2688.88 --> 2695.599
it's like the nemesis of the person

2693.68 --> 2698.3999999999996
that's how poltergeist typically

2695.599 --> 2701.2000000000003
manifests as the nemesis

2698.4 --> 2705.2400000000002
of the one that's causing it

2701.2 --> 2705.24
have you ever thought about it

2706.96 --> 2711.16
hello darts good to see you

2720.079 --> 2724.0
poltergeist is a noisy spirit

2725.44 --> 2729.52
not really it's not a spirit it's not

2727.68 --> 2730.56
another spirit

2729.52 --> 2734.079
it's

2730.56 --> 2734.0789999999997
the spirit of the person

2734.4 --> 2739.6800000000003
it's no poltergeist without a living

2737.28 --> 2739.6800000000003
person

2740.0 --> 2743.76
right the telekinetic activity

2742.4 --> 2747.839
is used

2743.76 --> 2747.8390000000004
from people from the person

2750.88 --> 2754.48
it's not another entity

2756.24 --> 2760.3999999999996
or well

2757.839 --> 2762.0
it can't really be proven to be another

2760.4 --> 2764.48
entity i mean

2762.0 --> 2766.68
technically

2764.48 --> 2769.359
if somebody would have

2766.68 --> 2770.96
poltergeist-like effects uncontrolled

2769.359 --> 2773.7599999999998
telekinesis

2770.96 --> 2776.2400000000002
that presents itself as the nemesis of

2773.76 --> 2777.2000000000003
the one that's having it

2776.24 --> 2778.24
then

2777.2 --> 2781.7599999999998
well

2778.24 --> 2781.7599999999998
if they became possessed

2782.16 --> 2785.839
then

2783.2 --> 2788.7999999999997
that might suddenly switch around

2785.839 --> 2791.359
and then basically the possessed demon

2788.8 --> 2793.3590000000004
state might actually gain conscious

2791.359 --> 2796.7999999999997
control of the telekinesis and that's

2793.359 --> 2798.319
when things get really [ __ ] up

2796.8 --> 2802.5600000000004
and usually

2798.319 --> 2806.56
ends up with that person dying

2802.56 --> 2808.88
i mean i believe actual telekinesis is

2806.56 --> 2810.96
really dangerous like to the one that's

2808.88 --> 2813.6800000000003
doing it

2810.96 --> 2815.28
it's kind of funny

2813.68 --> 2818.24
because

2815.28 --> 2819.92
so much later like decades later

2818.24 --> 2821.5989999999997
watching

2819.92 --> 2823.2000000000003
say

2821.599 --> 2826.079
stranger things

2823.2 --> 2827.2
well what happens every time

2826.079 --> 2829.599
l

2827.2 --> 2831.2799999999997
uses her telekinesis she gets a

2829.599 --> 2832.7200000000003
nosebleed

2831.28 --> 2835.44
what does that mean

2832.72 --> 2837.68
it means it hurts

2835.44 --> 2839.76
damages her

2837.68 --> 2842.319
so what happens

2839.76 --> 2844.48
if you are possessed

2842.319 --> 2846.0
by a demon which will

2844.48 --> 2847.2
not be

2846.0 --> 2849.04
like

2847.2 --> 2851.9199999999996
they will not

2849.04 --> 2853.7599999999998
be your friend of the actual person or

2851.92 --> 2856.48
they're there to steal your body and

2853.76 --> 2858.4
they might just waste it

2856.48 --> 2860.88
right if they're gen gonna be able to

2858.4 --> 2864.0
use your telekinesis when you normally

2860.88 --> 2864.88
would not be able to control it

2864.0 --> 2868.079
yeah

2864.88 --> 2868.079
it's gonna [ __ ] you up

2868.319 --> 2872.72
now of course

2870.16 --> 2875.839
i think that the occurrence of this sort

2872.72 --> 2877.9199999999996
of situation is extremely rare because i

2875.839 --> 2880.0
think that even when people don't

2877.92 --> 2881.92
consciously understand anything about

2880.0 --> 2883.2
this

2881.92 --> 2885.599
people

2883.2 --> 2885.5989999999997
parents

2885.68 --> 2892.0789999999997
friends will still subconsciously be

2888.559 --> 2894.6400000000003
very aware of the dangers

2892.079 --> 2896.7200000000003
of somebody that has like poltergeist

2894.64 --> 2900.0789999999997
telekinetic like side effects they will

2896.72 --> 2901.5989999999997
be on their toes very careful

2900.079 --> 2902.8
and

2901.599 --> 2905.92
not

2902.8 --> 2909.44
allow such an individual to just easily

2905.92 --> 2911.6800000000003
become possessed which often is

2909.44 --> 2914.68
on the long run a side effect of social

2911.68 --> 2914.68
negligence

2915.44 --> 2919.76
they getting vacated

2917.44 --> 2921.76
because is because of social negligence

2919.76 --> 2923.76
from others especially those that should

2921.76 --> 2926.7200000000003
be caring about you

2923.76 --> 2929.599
become vacated and that being vacated is

2926.72 --> 2933.04
literally the condition for a demon to

2929.599 --> 2934.88
just take up resident and say like oh oh

2933.04 --> 2936.4
so you're going to leave this person

2934.88 --> 2940.079
vacated

2936.4 --> 2940.079
now you're going to have to deal with me

2940.319 --> 2943.8
that's what happens

2959.119 --> 2963.28
you don't generally believe him okay i

2961.2 --> 2966.0789999999997
appreciate that you're actually

2963.28 --> 2968.1600000000003
spit yeah laying it out not just oh i

2966.079 --> 2970.2400000000002
don't agree this i don't agree with

2968.16 --> 2971.52
everything irwin is saying well this is

2970.24 --> 2973.839
interesting

2971.52 --> 2976.16
at least you gave some kind of a context

2973.839 --> 2978.0789999999997
to what you were talking about so thank

2976.16 --> 2979.52
you for that aries 106. i really

2978.079 --> 2983.119
appreciate

2979.52 --> 2985.68
it's more detailed comments right also

2983.119 --> 2987.76
poltergeists and ghosts are completely

2985.68 --> 2991.44
different effects

2987.76 --> 2991.44
they're totally unrelated

2991.92 --> 2995.76
right poltergeist is

2994.319 --> 2998.5589999999997
is a

2995.76 --> 2999.76
side effect of a living person

2998.559 --> 3000.96
ghost

2999.76 --> 3002.2400000000002
is

3000.96 --> 3004.64
energy

3002.24 --> 3007.4399999999996
remnant

3004.64 --> 3009.1189999999997
like within wood like wooden room wooden

3007.44 --> 3011.52
doors a lot of wood

3009.119 --> 3012.96
extreme activity from people that were

3011.52 --> 3014.559
like going out of their minds perhaps

3012.96 --> 3016.079
they were possessed perhaps they were

3014.559 --> 3018.3190000000004
like in it like a

3016.079 --> 3020.7200000000003
fatal heartbreak right

3018.319 --> 3023.2799999999997
they ooze energy the energy gets

3020.72 --> 3025.5989999999997
absorbed by the material especially wood

3023.28 --> 3028.0
then those people die and something

3025.599 --> 3031.119
happens the energy

3028.0 --> 3032.96
that's absorbed becomes like a

3031.119 --> 3033.92
a psychic

3032.96 --> 3035.76
letter

3033.92 --> 3037.44
that is there to be picked up by the

3035.76 --> 3039.44
subconsciousness of anybody that's

3037.44 --> 3041.599
sensitive they move past it like they

3039.44 --> 3045.2000000000003
touch the wood and suddenly

3041.599 --> 3045.2000000000003
they get like a flashback

3046.0 --> 3051.359
or suddenly an apparition might like a

3048.96 --> 3053.68
hallucination pop up like a ghost like

3051.359 --> 3054.96
right like how you see it in the movies

3053.68 --> 3057.68
either one

3054.96 --> 3059.599
but that's like a a letter

3057.68 --> 3062.72
being left behind

3059.599 --> 3063.92
by the event so it's an echo ghosts are

3062.72 --> 3066.7999999999997
echoes

3063.92 --> 3066.8
of extreme

3066.839 --> 3072.7999999999997
emotional events usually involving death

3070.72 --> 3075.2
but not necessarily like if you're just

3072.8 --> 3077.52
getting tortured for a long time and

3075.2 --> 3080.319
then still manage to escape that [ __ ]

3077.52 --> 3083.52
up energy is still gonna linger there

3080.319 --> 3084.72
will give a very brooding scary depleted

3083.52 --> 3087.44
feeling

3084.72 --> 3089.839
this yeah it will resonate what happened

3087.44 --> 3091.359
that's typically a ghost

3089.839 --> 3094.48
and now the actual

3091.359 --> 3094.48
sighting of a ghost

3095.68 --> 3101.2
it's i'd only can reference to people

3098.72 --> 3102.7999999999997
seeing it and when people seeing it it's

3101.2 --> 3106.7999999999997
the psychic letter

3102.8 --> 3109.44
expressing itself into like a visual

3106.8 --> 3111.92
video being played out with overlay with

3109.44 --> 3113.28
the environment that's a ghost

3111.92 --> 3115.119
it's like a

3113.28 --> 3116.6400000000003
yeah

3115.119 --> 3119.839
i cannot

3116.64 --> 3122.5589999999997
explain anything about like ghosts on

3119.839 --> 3125.2799999999997
camera i mean i've seen videos like that

3122.559 --> 3127.92
i do not understand what that is

3125.28 --> 3130.6400000000003
i cannot compare my

3127.92 --> 3133.839
understanding of

3130.64 --> 3135.68
personal encounters with ghosts

3133.839 --> 3138.319
with camera

3135.68 --> 3141.68
captured i don't understand i don't

3138.319 --> 3145.04
understand how and what that is

3141.68 --> 3147.44
it did this seem very unrelated

3145.04 --> 3147.44
to me

3149.68 --> 3155.2
how do i know all this

3153.119 --> 3157.44
well

3155.2 --> 3159.68
20 years ago

3157.44 --> 3159.68
i

3160.4 --> 3164.559
decided to become a wizard this is or

3163.2 --> 3167.68
something

3164.559 --> 3171.28
i got into the paranormal and i was like

3167.68 --> 3173.68
i am going to be a master at this i will

3171.28 --> 3175.2000000000003
understand everything about this

3173.68 --> 3177.64
and a lot of it

3175.2 --> 3180.5589999999997
i even wrote down on my own website

3177.64 --> 3182.8799999999997
symbolics.now from 2006 and it's still

3180.559 --> 3185.28
out there

3182.88 --> 3189.52
i studied this stuff i studied the

3185.28 --> 3194.3590000000004
spiritual i studied the extra dimensions

3189.52 --> 3194.359
even then 20 years ago

3195.119 --> 3198.4
and yeah back then it was still even

3197.28 --> 3200.559
like

3198.4 --> 3203.2000000000003
going through dark world experiences and

3200.559 --> 3206.2000000000003
all that so that was there on top of it

3203.2 --> 3206.2
all

3227.52 --> 3231.7599999999998
right

3229.28 --> 3235.0400000000004
by the way even on the symbolic side

3231.76 --> 3237.6800000000003
some of the definitions are outdated

3235.04 --> 3240.0
it's really weird like that

3237.68 --> 3243.2
it's just that i continually think about

3240.0 --> 3245.68
these things figure it out this is all

3243.2 --> 3247.68
because of just in

3245.68 --> 3250.24
in the field work reasoning

3247.68 --> 3252.0789999999997
cross-referencing experiencing hearing

3250.24 --> 3254.319
out other people's experiences about

3252.079 --> 3254.319
this

3254.72 --> 3259.2
one of those ghost videos no not really

3258.0 --> 3261.44
they just

3259.2 --> 3264.68
you bump into them sometimes especially

3261.44 --> 3264.68
on youtube

3267.04 --> 3271.8
and i've seen some really creepy ones

3279.359 --> 3284.0789999999997
the thing is this the the premise of

3281.92 --> 3286.2400000000002
what i'm trying to say why i think it's

3284.079 --> 3287.599
so different

3286.24 --> 3290.4799999999996
is that

3287.599 --> 3294.079
i've had a literal ghost

3290.48 --> 3297.119
type encounter from my mother

3294.079 --> 3298.4
right spirit tapping into me seeing the

3297.119 --> 3300.799
visage

3298.4 --> 3300.799
all that

3301.04 --> 3306.5589999999997
but it was so distinctly like in a in a

3304.559 --> 3311.0400000000004
sub world in

3306.559 --> 3311.0400000000004
like tapping into your mind using your

3311.119 --> 3316.079
inner visuals to

3313.68 --> 3319.839
represent itself right

3316.079 --> 3323.119
it's like every time anything ghosts

3319.839 --> 3325.52
related is usually like i've seen

3323.119 --> 3327.2000000000003
like ghosts or like

3325.52 --> 3328.88
there's somebody standing there but

3327.2 --> 3330.0789999999997
there's nobody there when you actually

3328.88 --> 3332.4
look

3330.079 --> 3333.2000000000003
that sort of thing

3332.4 --> 3337.04
right

3333.2 --> 3340.0789999999997
it's actually much more common

3337.04 --> 3342.319
than yeah i ignore it most of just like

3340.079 --> 3344.6400000000003
don't pay attention to that if you keep

3342.319 --> 3346.96
focusing on that your frequency is gonna

3344.64 --> 3349.1189999999997
like migrate to the shadow realm it's

3346.96 --> 3349.92
not good you're gonna attract more of

3349.119 --> 3352.4
them

3349.92 --> 3355.359
you're gonna get like you're gonna start

3352.4 --> 3355.359
to feel unwell

3355.68 --> 3361.2
could it be wandering soul

3358.72 --> 3363.9199999999996
whatever

3361.2 --> 3367.5989999999997
sure i'm just saying

3363.92 --> 3368.799
i can't explain how cameras

3367.599 --> 3371.52
can

3368.799 --> 3374.48
so it seems pick up

3371.52 --> 3377.04
visuals of ghosts

3374.48 --> 3378.4
apparitions

3377.04 --> 3379.2799999999997
but

3378.4 --> 3382.799
yeah

3379.28 --> 3385.119
when i think that it can really only be

3382.799 --> 3387.92
seen by the consciousness by the spirit

3385.119 --> 3390.0
that the spirit has the sensories

3387.92 --> 3392.799
for you to pick that up so i can't

3390.0 --> 3396.079
really explain i can't connect it

3392.799 --> 3399.839
mechanically in my mind how

3396.079 --> 3399.8390000000004
cameras can pick up ghosts

3402.96 --> 3405.839
i can't match it

3407.92 --> 3410.16
right

3411.44 --> 3416.2400000000002
and that also by the way keeps me in a

3413.92 --> 3417.92
position every time i see like ooh ghost

3416.24 --> 3420.3999999999996
videos and i'm always in my mind like

3417.92 --> 3422.96
yeah there's a really big chance this is

3420.4 --> 3424.96
faked somehow

3422.96 --> 3426.559
there is a really big chance that

3424.96 --> 3428.48
somehow

3426.559 --> 3432.599
like the person rolling out the video

3428.48 --> 3432.599
might not even realize it

3434.559 --> 3439.0400000000004
cameras don't pick up ghosts yeah well

3436.48 --> 3441.28
there's a big chance that that is indeed

3439.04 --> 3444.0
true

3441.28 --> 3445.28
but there's plenty of suggestion out

3444.0 --> 3449.52
there and

3445.28 --> 3449.52
videos that they supposedly are

3450.0 --> 3455.359
but mechanically through spirit

3452.0 --> 3457.68
mechanics i can't make that work

3455.359 --> 3459.5989999999997
i don't understand how it would be

3457.68 --> 3461.839
possible you see it's not like oh is

3459.599 --> 3465.2000000000003
this faked or is this real

3461.839 --> 3467.68
i don't understand how it could be real

3465.2 --> 3470.319
it doesn't match with my

3467.68 --> 3473.319
empirical experiences concerning these

3470.319 --> 3473.319
things

3481.2 --> 3485.5989999999997
i know that one isn't fake

3483.28 --> 3485.599
okay

3485.76 --> 3489.119
fine

3486.96 --> 3491.76
maybe there are some real photos that

3489.119 --> 3494.319
still doesn't explain to me how that is

3491.76 --> 3494.3190000000004
possible

3497.76 --> 3503.28
because as far as i'm concerned ghosts

3501.52 --> 3504.4
are

3503.28 --> 3506.7200000000003
not

3504.4 --> 3508.319
entities

3506.72 --> 3510.799
in which case

3508.319 --> 3512.0
it wouldn't be a ghost if you'd have a

3510.799 --> 3514.4
photograph

3512.0 --> 3516.48
it would be a spirit

3514.4 --> 3519.2000000000003
as something completely different from

3516.48 --> 3522.88
the effect of a ghost which again a

3519.2 --> 3524.48
ghost is like a letter being left behind

3522.88 --> 3527.119
in material

3524.48 --> 3528.559
like wood having absorbed extreme

3527.119 --> 3530.6400000000003
energies

3528.559 --> 3533.44
from a person

3530.64 --> 3535.2799999999997
and then somebody with sensitivity

3533.44 --> 3536.7200000000003
empathy empathy

3535.28 --> 3538.88
yeah

3536.72 --> 3540.9599999999996
would work the most

3538.88 --> 3544.319
comes by that thing

3540.96 --> 3545.359
absorbs the energy and then might have a

3544.319 --> 3548.319
vision

3545.359 --> 3551.7599999999998
temporarily created or even overlaid on

3548.319 --> 3555.359
the physical surroundings visually

3551.76 --> 3557.599
to show them an event

3555.359 --> 3560.4
that is like a re

3557.599 --> 3563.52
playing a recording of

3560.4 --> 3565.839
the yeah what happened

3563.52 --> 3568.559
in order to cause that ghost

3565.839 --> 3568.5589999999997
absorption

3568.88 --> 3574.6400000000003
so i can't match that inside those

3572.24 --> 3577.2799999999997
mechanics with

3574.64 --> 3580.5589999999997
apparitions on the camera i just can't

3577.28 --> 3582.6400000000003
it doesn't match it those cannot be that

3580.559 --> 3586.88
has to be separate things if that is

3582.64 --> 3590.0789999999997
real like that isn't a ghost

3586.88 --> 3590.079
it's not the same effect

3591.28 --> 3596.0
then again yeah what is a ghost a ghost

3593.76 --> 3599.5200000000004
is a colloquial word and anything that

3596.0 --> 3601.04
would suggest oh spooky or weird oh it's

3599.52 --> 3604.079
a ghost

3601.04 --> 3606.319
so yeah it's a colloquial ghost yeah

3604.079 --> 3608.1600000000003
sure it's a colloquial ghost

3606.319 --> 3612.319
but if you're gonna go into spirit

3608.16 --> 3614.64
mechanics is it like the ghost effect

3612.319 --> 3618.16
no it can't be the ghost effect if you

3614.64 --> 3620.0789999999997
get a ghost on camera it cannot be the

3618.16 --> 3622.16
ghost effect

3620.079 --> 3623.6800000000003
it would have to be

3622.16 --> 3627.8799999999997
an entity

3623.68 --> 3627.8799999999997
a disembodied entity

3630.079 --> 3636.75
i do not understand

3633.54 --> 3636.75
[Music]

3650.16 --> 3655.2
dude

3652.0 --> 3657.52
i'm not gonna do that as a gimmick yeah

3655.2 --> 3660.799
i'm not gonna have my own spooky ghost

3657.52 --> 3662.0
show i will talk about it i will explain

3660.799 --> 3665.44
about it

3662.0 --> 3667.92
not gonna go on ghost investigation

3665.44 --> 3669.28
yeah i did all this stuff like 20 years

3667.92 --> 3672.16
ago

3669.28 --> 3673.76
i'm not gonna do that like a gimmick

3672.16 --> 3676.16
okay

3673.76 --> 3679.76
done all the investigations i need i

3676.16 --> 3682.319
have exercised people i have exercised

3679.76 --> 3682.3190000000004
houses

3683.2 --> 3687.68
i've had that experience i've tested it

3688.4 --> 3694.2400000000002
i've encountered quite a few

3690.799 --> 3697.599
bizarre spirit things

3694.24 --> 3700.9599999999996
in people and outside of people

3697.599 --> 3704.079
and i have like even had like bizarre

3700.96 --> 3706.64
telekinetic situations

3704.079 --> 3709.76
like one time i was so angry that

3706.64 --> 3713.0
literally lightning started shooting out

3709.76 --> 3713.0
of the walls

3713.119 --> 3716.6400000000003
visually

3714.48 --> 3718.16
like

3716.64 --> 3719.44
what the [ __ ]

3718.16 --> 3722.3999999999996
and it was like

3719.44 --> 3724.96
my computer like there was like imagine

3722.4 --> 3727.119
my setup here and then like right behind

3724.96 --> 3729.92
my monitor against the wall like right

3727.119 --> 3732.0
next to my computer

3729.92 --> 3734.079
and like yeah my computer's still

3732.0 --> 3736.319
running though doesn't even seem to

3734.079 --> 3740.2400000000002
influence it but that freaking happened

3736.319 --> 3743.0389999999998
oh and by the way it hurt

3740.24 --> 3743.0389999999998
really hurt

3745.119 --> 3748.799
but that was definitely like a

3746.88 --> 3751.28
telekinetic effect

3748.799 --> 3752.839
and it felt like holy [ __ ] is that like

3751.28 --> 3756.079
emperor

3752.839 --> 3758.48
lightning okay better be careful with

3756.079 --> 3760.4
how much i allow myself to go rage

3758.48 --> 3762.64
squirting because that could be kind of

3760.4 --> 3763.599
dangerous

3762.64 --> 3765.92
this is

3763.599 --> 3768.0
and after that point i never let myself

3765.92 --> 3771.359
go that foaming at the mouth before

3768.0 --> 3771.359
because of something pointless

3774.559 --> 3780.6400000000003
maybe i'm related to thor

3776.48 --> 3780.64
well yeah maybe i'm related to zeus

3781.039 --> 3784.7200000000003
i don't i'm not really much of a thor

3783.76 --> 3786.079
guy

3784.72 --> 3788.319
at all

3786.079 --> 3791.6800000000003
zeus however

3788.319 --> 3795.64
i i get zeus

3791.68 --> 3795.64
i really get him

3806.4 --> 3809.599
[Music]

3810.96 --> 3814.799
zeus is a master of lightning too

3817.119 --> 3824.559
but yeah that happened one time

3820.319 --> 3826.16
one time also i heard somebody else a

3824.559 --> 3827.92
friend

3826.16 --> 3830.799
of me back then

3827.92 --> 3834.48
who also had said to have had that

3830.799 --> 3834.48
experience something like that

3834.559 --> 3839.28
one time he got really angry when other

3837.359 --> 3842.0789999999997
people were present he was like really

3839.28 --> 3844.1600000000003
furious but he kept it all internal and

3842.079 --> 3845.599
then literally lightning struck the

3844.16 --> 3848.16
house they were in

3845.599 --> 3850.559
and it fried all the electronics like

3848.16 --> 3854.8799999999997
everything burst

3850.559 --> 3858.559
stereo computers lamps everything bang

3854.88 --> 3858.559
yeah that freaked people out

3859.2 --> 3863.1189999999997
it didn't happen like that would be

3861.52 --> 3864.559
with me it was just lightning just so

3863.119 --> 3867.76
they've

3864.559 --> 3870.7200000000003
what the [ __ ] did i just create a bolt

3867.76 --> 3870.7200000000003
lightning or something

3871.16 --> 3874.31
[Music]

3875.2 --> 3879.7599999999998
but yeah i don't recommend it

3877.599 --> 3880.6400000000003
it's very painful

3879.76 --> 3883.44
it's

3880.64 --> 3885.1189999999997
kind of fitting that they tied like in

3883.44 --> 3888.319
star wars that they tied in that the

3885.119 --> 3889.44
emperor basically liking his own face

3888.319 --> 3892.079
the [ __ ]

3889.44 --> 3894.48
because yeah i can imagine it is like

3892.079 --> 3897.76
when you do that you're almost literally

3894.48 --> 3900.48
electrocuting yourself also it's crazy

3897.76 --> 3900.48
how it works

3901.599 --> 3905.76
or at least what that

3903.359 --> 3908.5589999999997
probably is hinting at because it

3905.76 --> 3911.44
doesn't literally work that way

3908.559 --> 3913.039
of course as in star wars never actually

3911.44 --> 3917.4
seen somebody just

3913.039 --> 3917.4
casually control lightning

3933.119 --> 3936.119
uh

3948.0 --> 3954.16
i don't mind flies just flying around

3950.72 --> 3956.8799999999997
but why do they always have to goddamn

3954.16 --> 3960.2799999999997
get right in front of my face during my

3956.88 --> 3960.28
live shows

3970.4 --> 3974.76
okay that's very funny george sanford

3996.64 --> 4000.24
no we cannot have a rage i'm not gonna

3998.88 --> 4004.079
rage

4000.24 --> 4004.0789999999997
i think you've had enough re like

4004.64 --> 4010.7599999999998
you should donate to my paypal just for

4007.119 --> 4010.76
suggesting that

4026.16 --> 4029.16
hmm

4053.839 --> 4059.359
cups are ready to catch

4055.92 --> 4061.039
right they're like tape recorders

4059.359 --> 4063.2799999999997
and you have to be sensitive and then

4061.039 --> 4064.7990000000004
you can pick it up

4063.28 --> 4067.6800000000003
i mean

4064.799 --> 4070.48
noticing a ghost is pretty magical

4067.68 --> 4072.72
it is it really does feel like magic

4070.48 --> 4075.52
you're literally getting

4072.72 --> 4077.2799999999997
a message from the past

4075.52 --> 4078.799
that's what just what is effectively

4077.28 --> 4081.28
happening it's like a

4078.799 --> 4083.92
because ghosts what that happens the

4081.28 --> 4086.3190000000004
absorption of extremity

4083.92 --> 4088.7200000000003
it is the subconscious like desperately

4086.319 --> 4092.319
trying to leave a message in a way

4088.72 --> 4092.319
and it is all quite magical

4094.64 --> 4101.5199999999995
now whether spirits are more common

4098.48 --> 4104.919999999999
than ghosts i don't know

4101.52 --> 4104.92
i don't know

4117.92 --> 4123.759
oh wow

4119.52 --> 4123.759
yeah that is that is amazing pgcnet

4127.12 --> 4132.0
not your cup of tea this subject

4129.279 --> 4133.4400000000005
isn't spooky ghost not your thing i get

4132.0 --> 4135.92
it

4133.44 --> 4139.3589999999995
i totally get it but it is

4135.92 --> 4141.279
it is still there and it can

4139.359 --> 4142.319
be integrated

4141.279 --> 4144.4800000000005
right

4142.319 --> 4146.88
you just gotta keep real you gotta

4144.48 --> 4149.599999999999
actually

4146.88 --> 4152.159000000001
think scientifically it's just very

4149.6 --> 4154.56
tough not that it's like oh dude

4152.159 --> 4158.08
this is science no it's not right

4154.56 --> 4160.4800000000005
scientific method doesn't really apply

4158.08 --> 4162.799
you shouldn't be marrying and

4160.48 --> 4164.799
manipulating the death of people in

4162.799 --> 4166.64
order to test where their ghosts work oh

4164.799 --> 4168.48
let's torture this person to see if

4166.64 --> 4170.08
there's a ghost effect oh what a great

4168.48 --> 4173.44
idea this is not

4170.08 --> 4175.679
criminally insane at all yes it is so

4173.44 --> 4176.44
don't do that don't

4175.679 --> 4180.159
don't

4176.44 --> 4182.4
scientifically investigate ghosts

4180.159 --> 4184.3189999999995
but

4182.4 --> 4186.48
you can definitely try to

4184.319 --> 4189.839000000001
provide a framework of understanding

4186.48 --> 4192.959999999999
based on logical inference and

4189.839 --> 4194.64
empirical information things that people

4192.96 --> 4196.4
have experienced and then just keep

4194.64 --> 4199.04
cross-referencing keep cross-rest and

4196.4 --> 4201.679
just keep comparing keep keeping in mind

4199.04 --> 4202.719
that people have their own contemporary

4201.679 --> 4205.6
view

4202.719 --> 4207.92
and wait that they emotionally hang onto

4205.6 --> 4210.56
things and that it's all gonna dilute it

4207.92 --> 4213.04
if you just let it all sink in over time

4210.56 --> 4214.84
and then have this massive map

4213.04 --> 4217.36
of things that

4214.84 --> 4219.52
happened on top of that what people

4217.36 --> 4222.239
typically respond with internally in

4219.52 --> 4224.320000000001
order to color that data and you uncolor

4222.239 --> 4228.239
it then you compare all the data and

4224.32 --> 4230.799999999999
then you just know this is what it is

4228.239 --> 4232.959999999999
because that's what everything says it

4230.8 --> 4234.96
is

4232.96 --> 4238.32
without literally saying it it's just

4234.96 --> 4242.08
the information is just saying that

4238.32 --> 4244.88
not people information itself

4242.08 --> 4247.88
that's how i did my paranormal

4244.88 --> 4247.88
investigations

4252.719 --> 4259.84
no address no

4256.32 --> 4259.84
no that's that's criminal

4262.88 --> 4268.08
no torture well you obviously don't

4265.199 --> 4270.239
really understand

4268.08 --> 4273.199
what ghosts are then

4270.239 --> 4276.639999999999
if you're going to say that

4273.199 --> 4279.678999999999
it requires trauma it requires

4276.64 --> 4282.159000000001
a tension and near break or complete

4279.679 --> 4284.719
break of the spirit in order to even

4282.159 --> 4286.879999999999
cause the effects

4284.719 --> 4289.36
right and hey peop you don't necessarily

4286.88 --> 4290.96
have to oh very specifically requires

4289.36 --> 4293.44
you tie them up and then you torture

4290.96 --> 4294.2390000000005
them and then the ghost effect no

4293.44 --> 4296.719
no

4294.239 --> 4300.08
no it can definitely happen in normal

4296.719 --> 4302.8
social relations that have gone right

4300.08 --> 4306.719
right where there's spousal abuse

4302.8 --> 4308.159000000001
for example oh yeah that is effectively

4306.719 --> 4311.6
torture

4308.159 --> 4314.879999999999
and that can result in a ghost effect

4311.6 --> 4318.2390000000005
right but the thing is there's always

4314.88 --> 4320.32
going to be an element of sin involved

4318.239 --> 4322.0
and that's why you shouldn't be getting

4320.32 --> 4325.12
scientific with it

4322.0 --> 4326.88
you don't want to tempt god

4325.12 --> 4328.8
with with like

4326.88 --> 4331.52
blatant sin

4328.8 --> 4333.679
just for knowledge that's mad science

4331.52 --> 4334.88
that's

4333.679 --> 4336.8
that's like

4334.88 --> 4338.88
creepy [ __ ]

4336.8 --> 4343.2390000000005
it's evil

4338.88 --> 4343.2390000000005
so let's not do that

4344.0 --> 4348.08
people dying from natural cause well

4346.0 --> 4351.28
yeah

4348.08 --> 4352.32
but look unless there is a pressing

4351.28 --> 4355.92
matter

4352.32 --> 4358.159
to drive the spirit to do such a thing

4355.92 --> 4359.92
what are you do what

4358.159 --> 4362.0
like serious ed you don't know what

4359.92 --> 4364.64
you're talking about i i don't think

4362.0 --> 4366.64
you're being malignant here but

4364.64 --> 4369.12
you don't understand like there's not

4366.64 --> 4372.64
gonna be a ghost effect unless there is

4369.12 --> 4372.64
something really pressing

4373.6 --> 4377.679
what you're going to like some old woman

4375.84 --> 4379.4400000000005
that's like oh i'm about to die and then

4377.679 --> 4380.64
they're like okay we want to do some

4379.44 --> 4381.5199999999995
tests here

4380.64 --> 4383.4400000000005
now

4381.52 --> 4384.96
excuse me but we're going to scare this

4383.44 --> 4386.159
[ __ ] out here

4384.96 --> 4388.8
right

4386.159 --> 4390.719
dude what the [ __ ] like

4388.8 --> 4391.679
how can you test this this makes no

4390.719 --> 4395.44
sense

4391.679 --> 4395.4400000000005
it doesn't make any like

4396.8 --> 4403.1990000000005
you can't unless you vary and manipulate

4400.56 --> 4405.360000000001
as the experimenter it's not even gonna

4403.199 --> 4407.12
be scientific it's just like oh

4405.36 --> 4409.04
something might happen

4407.12 --> 4411.12
let's see

4409.04 --> 4413.84
that's not experimentation that's just

4411.12 --> 4413.84
observation

4427.199 --> 4431.04
right and yeah sure you could just ask

4429.12 --> 4433.44
around like hey

4431.04 --> 4435.679
did any of your grandparents die did you

4433.44 --> 4437.759999999999
see something or did you hear something

4435.679 --> 4438.719
or did you get a special dream yeah you

4437.76 --> 4441.1990000000005
can

4438.719 --> 4443.6
do research of that

4441.199 --> 4446.32
but that's not going to be investigation

4443.6 --> 4449.120000000001
of ghosts that's just going to be

4446.32 --> 4451.199
internal spiritual social matters it's

4449.12 --> 4454.159
going to be a social investigation in

4451.199 --> 4458.4
how people respond to typical life

4454.159 --> 4458.4
situations it's not the same thing

4461.12 --> 4465.5199999999995
no no at face i'm not gonna describe to

4464.239 --> 4468.5599999999995
you

4465.52 --> 4471.280000000001
because i cannot set the morality of it

4468.56 --> 4473.1990000000005
aside and i'm not gonna set give you a

4471.28 --> 4475.599999999999
legitimate

4473.199 --> 4477.839999999999
evil setup that i think could work

4475.6 --> 4480.159000000001
because then i sin i'm not gonna give

4477.84 --> 4482.400000000001
you that i'm not gonna be evil

4480.159 --> 4485.04
to satisfy your

4482.4 --> 4486.5599999999995
pointless curiosity

4485.04 --> 4488.8
it's a thought experience yeah and i

4486.56 --> 4492.56
don't want to give you an evil thought

4488.8 --> 4495.6
experiment because i don't want to have

4492.56 --> 4498.2390000000005
something like that come out of my mouth

4495.6 --> 4498.2390000000005
in the open

4505.6 --> 4509.04
i mean

4507.12 --> 4511.76
i could think up

4509.04 --> 4514.32
really effective

4511.76 --> 4516.2390000000005
evil experiments that i would consider

4514.32 --> 4519.679
morally evil yeah i can make them

4516.239 --> 4521.36
extremely efficient

4519.679 --> 4524.08
does it matter

4521.36 --> 4527.36
that i can does it matter i shouldn't do

4524.08 --> 4527.36
it i don't want to do that

4527.44 --> 4530.5599999999995
god is watching

4535.679 --> 4538.56
you're trying to know more about this

4537.04 --> 4540.56
stuff well i'm afraid you're gonna have

4538.56 --> 4541.679
to just

4540.56 --> 4546.159000000001
use

4541.679 --> 4546.159
your observation and your memory

4546.239 --> 4550.839999999999
and refine your own character

4549.04 --> 4554.159
through

4550.84 --> 4557.76
psychology and inner reflection and

4554.159 --> 4560.96
critical inquiry to your own issues

4557.76 --> 4563.4400000000005
then you clear up then you will

4560.96 --> 4565.679
attain a lot more value from the

4563.44 --> 4567.36
knowledge you've already gathered

4565.679 --> 4569.6
from the data through personal

4567.36 --> 4571.36
interactions you've already gathered

4569.6 --> 4573.92
that's the way to get it

4571.36 --> 4576.12
you don't need scientific

4573.92 --> 4577.679
experimentation

4576.12 --> 4579.5199999999995
exclusively

4577.679 --> 4580.64
to prove something

4579.52 --> 4582.080000000001
yeah

4580.64 --> 4585.280000000001
just remember

4582.08 --> 4588.64
science doesn't prove everything

4585.28 --> 4593.12
it just proves the cause of an effect

4588.64 --> 4596.8
there's a lot of what is questions

4593.12 --> 4599.28
that science does not answer yet we can

4596.8 --> 4601.360000000001
answer it through the socratic method

4599.28 --> 4602.4
and logical inference

4601.36 --> 4604.239
and

4602.4 --> 4606.08
testing

4604.239 --> 4608.239
that's not science

4606.08 --> 4611.28
it's still very important in order to

4608.239 --> 4613.36
orient ourselves with reality

4611.28 --> 4615.92
and even to get to the point where we

4613.36 --> 4618.719
can do scientific experimentation you

4615.92 --> 4620.8
need to know a lot of what is before you

4618.719 --> 4623.8
can even get the science

4620.8 --> 4623.8
right

4625.76 --> 4630.2390000000005
hello number one harwin fan hello thank

4628.239 --> 4633.04
you

4630.239 --> 4635.839999999999
science hurts your head

4633.04 --> 4637.5199999999995
and what shouldn't

4635.84 --> 4639.360000000001
it's just that

4637.52 --> 4642.56
science is now

4639.36 --> 4645.679
a culture where it's like everything

4642.56 --> 4647.52
asking a question of science

4645.679 --> 4649.4400000000005
doing something and then something

4647.52 --> 4651.76
happening is science that's what they

4649.44 --> 4653.919999999999
say that's not what science is it's

4651.76 --> 4656.719
exactly the opposite science is

4653.92 --> 4659.28
extremely limited and detailed and

4656.719 --> 4659.28
precise

4659.679 --> 4662.8
and

4661.52 --> 4665.1990000000005
yeah

4662.8 --> 4668.320000000001
the result is the result and it will

4665.199 --> 4670.4
always be the result no matter what the

4668.32 --> 4671.92
philosophy of how everything ties in

4670.4 --> 4673.12
with each other

4671.92 --> 4674.88
becomes

4673.12 --> 4676.8
the experiment will always be the

4674.88 --> 4679.04
experiment and the experiment result

4676.8 --> 4681.4400000000005
will always be that result

4679.04 --> 4681.44
you see

4683.92 --> 4687.679
so science shouldn't have to hurt your

4686.48 --> 4691.199
head

4687.679 --> 4694.4
all you need to do is just realize that

4691.199 --> 4697.678999999999
the word has become abused

4694.4 --> 4699.599999999999
it's a mockery of what it really is now

4697.679 --> 4702.4
out there everybody thinks everything is

4699.6 --> 4702.400000000001
science it isn't

4705.36 --> 4710.36
yes i know the movie weird science

4715.59 --> 4720.42
[Music]

4725.92 --> 4728.719
silhouette

4731.12 --> 4734.12
right

4737.44 --> 4741.36
now with that

4738.56 --> 4744.0
i think you're missing the point

4741.36 --> 4745.5199999999995
what you're saying biased or affected by

4744.0 --> 4748.64
illusion

4745.52 --> 4749.84
that's the points

4748.64 --> 4750.719
ghosts

4749.84 --> 4752.56
are

4750.719 --> 4754.64
illusions

4752.56 --> 4757.1990000000005
they're illusions from the mind that

4754.64 --> 4759.360000000001
spring forth in a very specific fashion

4757.199 --> 4760.879999999999
in response to an energy

4759.36 --> 4764.08
like a tape

4760.88 --> 4766.719
spirit tape you come close then suddenly

4764.08 --> 4768.4
it starts playing and in your mind the

4766.719 --> 4771.12
illusion

4768.4 --> 4773.839999999999
starts playing out

4771.12 --> 4777.44
that's not you imagining it that's so

4773.84 --> 4779.92
your imagination being used to show you

4777.44 --> 4779.919999999999
something

4780.96 --> 4785.199
that's the point

4782.88 --> 4788.8
of ghosts

4785.199 --> 4791.36
this is not an entity

4788.8 --> 4794.159000000001
spirits would be entities

4791.36 --> 4796.88
those aren't ghosts those are actually

4794.159 --> 4798.639999999999
separated consciousness

4796.88 --> 4800.719
that is

4798.64 --> 4801.52
a disembodied consciousness you could

4800.719 --> 4805.159
say

4801.52 --> 4805.159000000001
it's really weird

4811.84 --> 4815.76
what do you think of the boxes that

4814.159 --> 4818.638999999999
people use to communicate with ghosts

4815.76 --> 4820.56
ridiculous

4818.639 --> 4822.0
it's all nonsense

4820.56 --> 4823.84
if you want to

4822.0 --> 4825.76
first off you can't communicate with

4823.84 --> 4827.360000000001
ghosts again because they are not

4825.76 --> 4830.96
entities

4827.36 --> 4833.12
they're like spiritual tape recorders

4830.96 --> 4834.8
it happens to you they're not entities

4833.12 --> 4836.96
that you can contact

4834.8 --> 4838.0
if you want to contact spirits why the

4836.96 --> 4841.44
hell

4838.0 --> 4844.639
would you use a device

4841.44 --> 4846.96
seriously like you can use anything to

4844.639 --> 4848.8
communicate with spirits because

4846.96 --> 4849.679
you don't need

4848.8 --> 4851.1990000000005
like

4849.679 --> 4853.52
physical

4851.199 --> 4855.5199999999995
doing physical things to do that that's

4853.52 --> 4856.4800000000005
the point if you want to contact the

4855.52 --> 4858.639
spirit

4856.48 --> 4860.959999999999
you literally just contact the spirit oh

4858.639 --> 4863.36
you can't well that's probably because

4860.96 --> 4866.56
you got defenses up

4863.36 --> 4868.48
and effectively it's not safe for you to

4866.56 --> 4871.84
if you're going to use a device as like

4868.48 --> 4871.839999999999
a middle road

4873.76 --> 4877.04
it's

4875.28 --> 4881.199
if you're going to keep looking for

4877.04 --> 4884.8
spirit or proof of spirits in physical

4881.199 --> 4886.48
things happening you just don't get it

4884.8 --> 4888.719
don't understand what it is you don't

4886.48 --> 4890.959999999999
understand that you have a spirit and

4888.719 --> 4896.679
that your spirit actually makes it

4890.96 --> 4896.679
possible to even identify spirits

4903.04 --> 4909.36
go stuck in the wall if wolf captures

4905.679 --> 4909.36
memories somehow yes correct

4914.32 --> 4921.5199999999995
especially wood what seems very

4918.0 --> 4924.48
absorbent of this type of energy like

4921.52 --> 4925.76
it gives more detail

4924.48 --> 4927.678999999999
also

4925.76 --> 4928.4800000000005
uh places

4927.679 --> 4930.4800000000005
that

4928.48 --> 4934.239
are comprised of things like granite

4930.48 --> 4935.28
original raw granite they cannot

4934.239 --> 4938.08
absorb

4935.28 --> 4939.92
ghost effects how interesting is that

4938.08 --> 4942.639
like there are materials that are

4939.92 --> 4945.6
impervious to this effect

4942.639 --> 4947.84
so that no ghost no no extreme

4945.6 --> 4950.08
experience could ever

4947.84 --> 4952.8
be echoed

4950.08 --> 4954.96
within such a place

4952.8 --> 4957.12
and by the way if you have empathy you

4954.96 --> 4960.56
will feel that about it you will feel

4957.12 --> 4962.719
like whoa it's like barriers everywhere

4960.56 --> 4966.120000000001
you can't reach through the material

4962.719 --> 4966.12
with your spirit

4972.159 --> 4976.32
no woodworking gunny bear

4974.159 --> 4978.638999999999
ghost spirits have nothing to do with

4976.32 --> 4981.12
the frequencies of light and sound it's

4978.639 --> 4982.32
non-material

4981.12 --> 4985.639
it's not

4982.32 --> 4985.639
of that

4988.719 --> 4994.639
yes stop trying to find spirits in the

4992.08 --> 4997.679
material their spirits they are per

4994.639 --> 4999.84
definition not material

4997.679 --> 5001.84
they're spirits if you wouldn't have a

4999.84 --> 5004.159000000001
spirit you wouldn't even be able to

5001.84 --> 5008.360000000001
detect it

5004.159 --> 5008.36
you wouldn't pick up on it

5015.199 --> 5018.159
it's okay

5018.48 --> 5024.959999999999
respect would i totally agree with that

5021.679 --> 5024.96
definitely respect wood

5027.44 --> 5032.48
what has memory

5029.12 --> 5035.28
literally like the substance itself has

5032.48 --> 5038.32
spirit memory yeah

5035.28 --> 5042.0
and if you combine that living would now

5038.32 --> 5043.199
things get interesting because

5042.0 --> 5045.92
a tree

5043.199 --> 5048.96
has its own spirit it's very subtle but

5045.92 --> 5051.679
it is a spirit

5048.96 --> 5054.96
it has a level of consciousness or

5051.679 --> 5058.4
rather more subconsciousness very little

5054.96 --> 5060.639
actual material conscious in that summer

5058.4 --> 5060.638999999999
yeah

5061.52 --> 5066.88
but yeah wood has memory

5065.04 --> 5070.96
can you imagine that yeah

5066.88 --> 5075.679
a tree had a living tree like an old one

5070.96 --> 5077.679
has like its very substance is

5075.679 --> 5080.88
spirit memory

5077.679 --> 5084.08
it has very little consciousness

5080.88 --> 5086.32
but if something happens the tree can

5084.08 --> 5089.12
literally like

5086.32 --> 5091.12
receive your spirit

5089.12 --> 5094.08
and then have its own

5091.12 --> 5097.199
subconsciousness

5094.08 --> 5099.679
reflect upon that energy

5097.199 --> 5102.719
with that is absorbed

5099.679 --> 5105.76
in the very wood fabric

5102.719 --> 5108.0
this is it's just really fascinating

5105.76 --> 5110.0
when you think about it

5108.0 --> 5112.4
never look at my wood table the same

5110.0 --> 5115.44
again good you shouldn't

5112.4 --> 5115.44
should respect wood

5115.84 --> 5120.56
it matters wood has memory it remembers

5118.56 --> 5123.280000000001
your spirit

5120.56 --> 5126.280000000001
especially when you get extremely

5123.28 --> 5126.28
distressful

5137.199 --> 5143.678999999999
that's right pgc that pretty much

5139.199 --> 5143.678999999999
summarizes it yes glad you're getting it

5148.0 --> 5151.679
maybe tree huggers have a good thing

5149.84 --> 5154.639
going then yes

5151.679 --> 5157.4400000000005
yes they do isn't that just amazing and

5154.639 --> 5157.4400000000005
hilarious

5157.76 --> 5164.4800000000005
ooh stupid tree huggers yeah well maybe

5160.639 --> 5166.08
that's actually really therapeutical

5164.48 --> 5169.04
like and

5166.08 --> 5171.36
like you can actually reason out how it

5169.04 --> 5173.5199999999995
is therapeutical other than just the

5171.36 --> 5175.839999999999
idea of hugging

5173.52 --> 5175.84
yeah

5176.32 --> 5181.759999999999
i love these kinds of silly silly little

5179.6 --> 5183.679
ironies i love it

5181.76 --> 5185.4400000000005
i love that [ __ ] it's like oh you

5183.679 --> 5188.08
thought it was really stupid oh it turns

5185.44 --> 5190.239
out to be really not stupid

5188.08 --> 5192.639
that actually everybody that just took

5190.239 --> 5195.199
for granted thinking it was stupid was

5192.639 --> 5197.36
the stupid one

5195.199 --> 5200.239
you flipped it around you were in the

5197.36 --> 5200.239
reversed world

5200.88 --> 5203.4400000000005
i love it

5205.6 --> 5210.400000000001
now it can still be very annoying i mean

5208.4 --> 5211.44
tree huggers can still be annoying

5210.4 --> 5213.44
people

5211.44 --> 5216.0
but that doesn't mean that the hugging

5213.44 --> 5216.799999999999
the process of hugging trees

5216.0 --> 5219.28
is

5216.8 --> 5221.679
stupid

5219.28 --> 5223.759999999999
i've hugged a few trees in my life and

5221.679 --> 5225.76
i've always found it to be extremely

5223.76 --> 5228.400000000001
effective

5225.76 --> 5230.639
it's just that

5228.4 --> 5232.4
it makes you look kind of stupid so you

5230.639 --> 5235.52
really don't want to do that when

5232.4 --> 5235.5199999999995
everybody's looking

5236.88 --> 5240.08
so if i'm gonna hug a tree i'm gonna do

5238.719 --> 5241.92
it like in the middle of the woods when

5240.08 --> 5245.12
nobody's looking

5241.92 --> 5246.8
because it just looks silly

5245.12 --> 5250.76
unless you're like a little kid and then

5246.8 --> 5250.76
it just looks really cute

5262.96 --> 5267.84
no woodworking gunny bear don't worry

5264.88 --> 5267.84
about that

5274.96 --> 5280.92
i don't think trees hate woodworkers

5277.679 --> 5280.92
right because

5282.48 --> 5286.4
you do it with love and you want you're

5285.12 --> 5287.84
gonna make

5286.4 --> 5291.92
the material

5287.84 --> 5292.88
last longer effectively

5291.92 --> 5296.0
right

5292.88 --> 5297.92
i mean i think trees do like to be

5296.0 --> 5301.28
this sounds really bizarre but i don't

5297.92 --> 5303.36
think trees have that much

5301.28 --> 5306.8
of an identity

5303.36 --> 5307.759999999999
compared to mammals and people

5306.8 --> 5310.400000000001
like

5307.76 --> 5312.96
there's a part gets cut off they're like

5310.4 --> 5315.36
very decentralized

5312.96 --> 5318.0
like they it doesn't matter too much to

5315.36 --> 5320.159
them right it's just that if you are

5318.0 --> 5323.6
really disrespectful you're like

5320.159 --> 5325.679
just just smash the tree right

5323.6 --> 5327.1990000000005
or just destroy it or burn it or

5325.679 --> 5329.36
something that's

5327.199 --> 5333.44
that's an offense that's what they don't

5329.36 --> 5333.44
like if you're actually respectful

5333.679 --> 5337.84
and you just use the trees for

5335.52 --> 5339.280000000001
appliances

5337.84 --> 5340.2390000000005
or even for

5339.28 --> 5341.599999999999
wood

5340.239 --> 5344.48
for your own

5341.6 --> 5346.400000000001
for your own yeah heat eating

5344.48 --> 5348.799999999999
i don't think trees mind all that much

5346.4 --> 5352.4
as long as you just do it respectfully

5348.8 --> 5354.96
right trees care more about

5352.4 --> 5357.04
your attitude than what what actually

5354.96 --> 5359.52
happens to them

5357.04 --> 5362.48
sounds weird right but that's i i'm not

5359.52 --> 5366.400000000001
saying this is absolute it's just that's

5362.48 --> 5366.4
been my impression so far

5366.56 --> 5370.639
jesus was a carpenter there you go

5372.32 --> 5377.199
i think

5373.84 --> 5379.52
this is pure wild speculation based on

5377.199 --> 5381.36
my own interactions in spirit sensory so

5379.52 --> 5383.360000000001
i'm sorry i don't have any references

5381.36 --> 5385.759999999999
for you or quotations

5383.36 --> 5387.92
i think that's that trees

5385.76 --> 5391.280000000001
care more about how

5387.92 --> 5392.96
your spirit is when you deal with them

5391.28 --> 5393.38
then whether you're going to cut them

5392.96 --> 5394.4800000000005
down

5393.38 --> 5395.4400000000005
[Music]

5394.48 --> 5399.839999999999
and

5395.44 --> 5399.839999999999
yeah turn them into something else

5403.28 --> 5406.4
how did you learn all this about trees i

5405.6 --> 5409.6
just

5406.4 --> 5413.04
figured it out i used my spirit i took

5409.6 --> 5415.52
entities serious it was just like

5413.04 --> 5418.08
my attitude very young was

5415.52 --> 5420.320000000001
everything is alive

5418.08 --> 5423.04
and like you should learn to deal with

5420.32 --> 5424.639
other people so should we learn to deal

5423.04 --> 5426.8
with other things

5424.639 --> 5427.679
as entities

5426.8 --> 5430.320000000001
and

5427.679 --> 5433.36
from that point on just investigating

5430.32 --> 5435.92
just like oh hey tree

5433.36 --> 5438.08
and then like literally recognizing it

5435.92 --> 5439.28
like it has a conscious

5438.08 --> 5440.719
and then

5439.28 --> 5443.679
going with it

5440.719 --> 5443.679
see what happens

5444.88 --> 5451.4400000000005
right all i have to do is not be ashamed

5448.159 --> 5454.638999999999
oh my god what if somebody sees me

5451.44 --> 5457.678999999999
talking to a tree oh no i'm insane yeah

5454.639 --> 5460.4800000000005
[ __ ] you how about [ __ ] you you bunch of

5457.679 --> 5462.32
[ __ ] little retards with your big

5460.48 --> 5463.599999999999
blabbering mouth that literally don't

5462.32 --> 5465.84
know [ __ ]

5463.6 --> 5468.159000000001
it would [ __ ] your own pants once you're

5465.84 --> 5469.52
actually confronted with anything about

5468.159 --> 5472.719
what you do

5469.52 --> 5474.719
yeah i don't give a [ __ ]

5472.719 --> 5477.04
i used to i used to be afraid of what

5474.719 --> 5479.36
people thought of me with those types of

5477.04 --> 5481.199
things now i don't i'm just like no

5479.36 --> 5483.12
i know what i'm doing yeah well it

5481.199 --> 5486.0
sounds so weird right yeah i don't give

5483.12 --> 5487.92
a [ __ ] man i don't give a [ __ ] i know

5486.0 --> 5490.639
what i'm doing

5487.92 --> 5493.28
and if you wanna know too you better pay

5490.639 --> 5493.28
attention

5498.239 --> 5503.599999999999
i feel bad for christmas tree

5500.96 --> 5505.92
yeah well

5503.6 --> 5508.639
don't cut them down

5505.92 --> 5510.32
you know i don't like that

5508.639 --> 5511.6
it's even in the bible man you shouldn't

5510.32 --> 5513.679
do that

5511.6 --> 5515.360000000001
i mean the reason why you're doing it is

5513.679 --> 5518.88
pointless

5515.36 --> 5521.199
if you want a christmas tree have one

5518.88 --> 5524.88
with the roots

5521.199 --> 5528.08
and then when you're done with christmas

5524.88 --> 5532.84
you put them back outside you plant them

5528.08 --> 5532.84
back in the ground or in your garden

5532.88 --> 5535.76
and then

5533.84 --> 5538.400000000001
who knows maybe you could like

5535.76 --> 5540.8
re-dig it up and do it over again the

5538.4 --> 5542.638999999999
next year i don't know some system just

5540.8 --> 5547.04
don't cut them down

5542.639 --> 5549.6
that's like a tree sacrifice

5547.04 --> 5551.44
like you're literally then yeah that's

5549.6 --> 5553.120000000001
seems atrocious because of just the

5551.44 --> 5554.5599999999995
setup it's like oh you're literally

5553.12 --> 5556.719
cutting it down

5554.56 --> 5558.2390000000005
you're not making it into something

5556.719 --> 5560.96
you're just

5558.239 --> 5563.36
dressing up a corpse and letting it

5560.96 --> 5563.36
wither

5563.92 --> 5567.76
that's always yeah when i thought about

5566.239 --> 5569.839999999999
that the more time passed the more i

5567.76 --> 5571.4400000000005
just didn't really like christmas trees

5569.84 --> 5575.84
like that

5571.44 --> 5575.839999999999
but yeah you know

5578.239 --> 5584.799999999999
you don't necessarily have to cut the

5581.44 --> 5586.4
tree down you can do it with the roots

5584.8 --> 5589.28
like my

5586.4 --> 5592.0
stepmother also does that

5589.28 --> 5596.48
she has a christmas tree really big

5592.0 --> 5596.48
but it's they don't she doesn't kill it

5597.6 --> 5604.159000000001
dressing up yeah i know right

5601.6 --> 5605.360000000001
well if you literally cut the tree off

5604.159 --> 5606.799999999999
its roots

5605.36 --> 5608.4
and put it

5606.8 --> 5610.2390000000005
dress it up like a christmas tree yeah

5608.4 --> 5613.04
that is like dressing up a corpse it's

5610.239 --> 5615.12
really [ __ ] up

5613.04 --> 5617.44
if you keep the roots i don't think the

5615.12 --> 5619.92
tree mines all that much

5617.44 --> 5622.879999999999
i mean that's not an atrocity then

5619.92 --> 5626.4800000000005
it's more like inviting another being in

5622.88 --> 5628.4800000000005
your house to celebrate with you then

5626.48 --> 5632.239
right you're not killing it

5628.48 --> 5633.839999999999
and then making a mockery of its corpse

5632.239 --> 5635.36
so yeah

5633.84 --> 5637.4400000000005
it's still stupid

5635.36 --> 5639.92
sure you could think of it as stupid if

5637.44 --> 5642.719
you like i'm just like okay if you want

5639.92 --> 5645.84
to have a christmas tree don't cut it

5642.719 --> 5645.84
off its roots

5646.159 --> 5652.759999999999
dig it out with its roots

5648.8 --> 5652.76
so that it can survive

5661.12 --> 5664.32
how did we get to this

5666.08 --> 5670.84
get the christmas trees so weird

5677.04 --> 5681.199
pagan worshipping christmas you know

5679.6 --> 5682.400000000001
that all depends on what you're gonna do

5681.199 --> 5683.919999999999
with it

5682.4 --> 5688.159
besides there's nothing wrong with

5683.92 --> 5691.76
paganism absolutely nothing

5688.159 --> 5694.719
absolutely nothing wrong with it

5691.76 --> 5698.08
as long as you don't go worship deities

5694.719 --> 5701.84
and like make sacrifices to deities

5698.08 --> 5701.84
paganism is perfectly fine

5708.8 --> 5711.92
tree hugging right

5713.679 --> 5717.92
time has flown really good show thank

5715.36 --> 5720.719
you pgc i am very satisfied with today's

5717.92 --> 5723.36
show too yeah

5720.719 --> 5726.2390000000005
at least yeah it's not an angry show i

5723.36 --> 5728.96
like that i mean i guess anger has its

5726.239 --> 5731.919999999999
place and it's time

5728.96 --> 5733.76
but i i don't like it guys i don't like

5731.92 --> 5735.92
it when that happens it always makes me

5733.76 --> 5737.92
feel sore it makes me feel like i just

5735.92 --> 5740.639
had a fight with the spouse or something

5737.92 --> 5740.639
and then it's like

5741.04 --> 5745.84
even if it was justified in ways it

5743.6 --> 5747.92
doesn't matter it just i don't like it

5745.84 --> 5749.4400000000005
so i'm much happier today with today's

5747.92 --> 5752.2390000000005
show

5749.44 --> 5754.239
and i like talking about spooky ghosts

5752.239 --> 5756.879999999999
and spirit mechanics i like talking

5754.239 --> 5759.44
about silly silly subjects that normally

5756.88 --> 5762.719
would make you giggle and then suddenly

5759.44 --> 5764.48
present you with a really fascinating

5762.719 --> 5766.56
cohesive

5764.48 --> 5768.638999999999
infra piece of information about it like

5766.56 --> 5771.76
this hey this is what my investigation

5768.639 --> 5773.76
has led me to this is very serious yeah

5771.76 --> 5774.88
i know on the surface so really silly

5773.76 --> 5776.88
and funny

5774.88 --> 5779.92
but actually i did a really serious

5776.88 --> 5783.719
investigation in this

5779.92 --> 5783.719
i like doing that

5807.44 --> 5814.4
their giants there were huge trees yeah

5810.239 --> 5814.4
good point number one are we in fact

5814.96 --> 5820.96
it's still a bit of a weird name dude

5818.96 --> 5823.679
but everything you said so far seems to

5820.96 --> 5823.679
be pretty cool

5825.52 --> 5829.76
but yeah there is a very strong

5827.44 --> 5832.48
historical correlation between huge

5829.76 --> 5835.119000000001
trees and giants i agree and it might

5832.48 --> 5837.119
have to do with the oxygen content

5835.119 --> 5838.719
you're right it might

5837.119 --> 5841.839999999999
it might actually

5838.719 --> 5841.84
it's really interesting

5848.88 --> 5855.84
to enjoy your age win

5851.28 --> 5855.84
is good in limited amounts i agreed

5869.76 --> 5874.96
conspiracy is somehow fair game

5872.48 --> 5877.678999999999
we should be a protected group no

5874.96 --> 5878.8
that's the worst idea ever here we go

5877.679 --> 5881.04
again

5878.8 --> 5886.76
we don't need to be a protected group

5881.04 --> 5886.76
that's a terrible idea terrible

5887.28 --> 5891.84
terrible

5889.119 --> 5894.0
becoming protected is a curse

5891.84 --> 5898.8
now what needs to happen is that the

5894.0 --> 5899.76
other groups need to be unprotected

5898.8 --> 5902.320000000001
why

5899.76 --> 5904.2390000000005
because that's literally a wall

5902.32 --> 5908.239
you're building a wall

5904.239 --> 5910.638999999999
where suddenly an other an outside force

5908.239 --> 5912.5599999999995
that will not probably have the best

5910.639 --> 5915.04
interest of our

5912.56 --> 5917.04
of us in their hearts

5915.04 --> 5918.159
like they will not really care but they

5917.04 --> 5919.36
will

5918.159 --> 5922.5599999999995
literally

5919.36 --> 5925.759999999999
prevent other people from engaging us or

5922.56 --> 5928.159000000001
criticizing us right it's not just the

5925.76 --> 5930.4800000000005
trolls no they will then make it illegal

5928.159 --> 5933.36
even to have general criticism they will

5930.48 --> 5936.638999999999
with hold people that actually want

5933.36 --> 5939.839999999999
legitimate inquiry from us then

5936.639 --> 5941.4400000000005
protected group yeah be prepared to turn

5939.84 --> 5944.0
into the

5941.44 --> 5945.839999999999
infamous chinese emperor that was

5944.0 --> 5947.6
literally locked in his own palace

5945.84 --> 5950.159000000001
couldn't even communicate with anybody

5947.6 --> 5952.719
outside that's what happens when you're

5950.159 --> 5954.638999999999
a protected group it's what always

5952.719 --> 5956.4800000000005
happens you should never even want to be

5954.639 --> 5959.119
a protected group you should just

5956.48 --> 5960.799999999999
unprotect the other groups that's the

5959.119 --> 5963.04
problem the problem is that there is

5960.8 --> 5964.400000000001
protected groups

5963.04 --> 5967.5199999999995
anyway

5964.4 --> 5969.5199999999995
getting trolled in the workplace

5967.52 --> 5972.400000000001
right level playing field that's exactly

5969.52 --> 5976.080000000001
that's the right that's the right one

5972.4 --> 5979.04
controlling the words this is

5976.08 --> 5981.84
i need protection from my trees no you

5979.04 --> 5981.84
don't

5982.0 --> 5985.76
just need to have an understanding and

5984.0 --> 5988.0
give them a good time just like if

5985.76 --> 5988.0
you're

5988.159 --> 5993.04
a cattle farmer

5990.56 --> 5995.119000000001
right and even you slaughter them

5993.04 --> 5996.8
it doesn't matter you just need to treat
