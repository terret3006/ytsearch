[Music]

138.54 --> 144.319

147.36 --> 150.98000000000002
and there so that has been nice

152.819 --> 156.83999999999997
I mean right now there's a really great

155.099 --> 158.04
spot uh

156.84 --> 161.66
right

158.04 --> 161.66
behind the wall behind me

163.2 --> 168.78
where I put the chair and then I'm in

165.959 --> 170.28
the shade and I also get the wind of the

168.78 --> 172.379
corner

170.28 --> 176.0
great spot to be

172.379 --> 178.5
and you got this great Outlook over

time now

180.66 --> 183.66
foreign

191.819 --> 198.29999999999998
like setting up a beach set up but on

195.36 --> 200.28
the grass right beside the water there

198.3 --> 203.04000000000002
and I mean yeah

200.28 --> 204.659
why not it's not super crowded or

203.04 --> 207.54
anything but there are like continually

204.659 --> 211.26
people there with this heat I don't

207.54 --> 213.9
blame them and it's Sunday so

211.26 --> 216.239
right anyway hello LSG first in chat

213.9 --> 223.739
good to see you

216.239 --> 223.739
it is Sunday the 10th of September 2023

226.14 --> 231.61999999999998
what the temperature actually it's

228.12 --> 231.62
probably not even 30.

232.019 --> 237.14000000000001
oh wait yeah it is 31 okay

238.14 --> 244.04
clouded right

240.08 --> 244.04000000000002
clouded sure

244.86 --> 250.94000000000003
they mean dump Haze in the air then yeah

247.739 --> 250.94
sure clouded

251.519 --> 255.95000000000002
anyway

252.64 --> 255.95
[Music]

256.079 --> 258.79900000000004
foreign

262.74 --> 267.259
how's the temperature over at your place

264.72 --> 267.259
at least

269.639 --> 272.639
ah

277.54 --> 281.88
[Music]

279.259 --> 283.97900000000004
right the plants don't seem to mind this

281.88 --> 286.699
at all I mean the mint is still

283.979 --> 286.699
exploding

290.88 --> 296.6
I wonder if it's actually growing at a

293.16 --> 296.6
slight exponential rate

297.0 --> 301.16
I'll keep you guys up to date regularly

301.259 --> 306.86
any fibroids cool and raining oh okay

312.419 --> 316.21999999999997
where were you at five roads

317.58 --> 320.71999999999997
[Music]

328.139 --> 334.759
hey Oz

329.639 --> 334.759
cool raining too wow am I the only one

339.84 --> 343.4
that's also kind of north right

344.28 --> 347.23999999999995
or myth

350.16 --> 356.639
I'm I'm getting slightly better at USA

353.22 --> 358.86
topography with the states but

356.639 --> 361.28000000000003
I mean it's it's a pretty it's a big

358.86 --> 361.28000000000003
chore

363.12 --> 367.88
we never learned it in like school at

366.24 --> 371.46000000000004
that typical age when you learn

367.88 --> 373.08
topography we learned like about our

371.46 --> 377.12
country

373.08 --> 377.12
and Europe especially

378.419 --> 382.25899999999996
but then after that it's just kind of

380.88 --> 384.539
like

382.259 --> 387.90000000000003
I don't know

384.539 --> 390.24
so most of the capital stuff locations

387.9 --> 392.09999999999997
that I learned Topography of

390.24 --> 395.84000000000003
America

392.1 --> 395.84000000000003
I've learned basically after

396.539 --> 400.58
well after running into Alex Jones

400.86 --> 406.91900000000004
which was great I mean

403.74 --> 410.46000000000004
in that time period early 2000s he was

406.919 --> 412.85999999999996
like really inspired and energetic and

410.46 --> 414.59999999999997
like he really loved America and he

412.86 --> 417.44
would like share all that stuff and it

414.6 --> 417.44
was amazing to me

417.479 --> 420.139
so

422.46 --> 429.44
with intermittent crazy hype sphere porn

425.759 --> 432.24
stuff I mean that was there too

429.44 --> 433.74
I'll try not to let that be Mendel out

432.24 --> 434.86
of the way or something

433.74 --> 438.04
huh

434.86 --> 438.04
[Music]

441.66 --> 449.41900000000004
great break from the right at least yeah

444.84 --> 449.419
yeah in that way I I'm it's like great

450.66 --> 454.44
I mean I'm pretty sure that at some

452.34 --> 456.84
point in the coming week where it's

454.44 --> 460.88
gonna get a bit cooler too although they

456.84 --> 460.88
seem to like keep postponing it

463.02 --> 468.35999999999996
or maybe this is an attempt like come on

465.66 --> 470.16
how can we make it storm we predicted it

468.36 --> 472.74
would storm damn it but it didn't happen

470.16 --> 476.03900000000004
so now we want to make it storm I mean

472.74 --> 478.139
maybe the maybe it's just

476.039 --> 480.479
like what Owen Benjamin says it's just

478.139 --> 483.419
the weather Jews they're like trying

480.479 --> 484.919
they're just trying

483.419 --> 486.599
sorry

484.919 --> 488.46
I'm making fun of it it's actually

486.599 --> 490.44
really serious but at the same time like

488.46 --> 492.419
I yeah I can't really do anything about

490.44 --> 493.979
it but just point at it say like hey

492.419 --> 496.34
this is what I'm seeing this is the

493.979 --> 496.34
pattern

496.759 --> 501.319
that I can derive from what's Happening

501.599 --> 505.139
and overall the weather had yeah and

503.4 --> 507.12
even the trailing they don't do it every

505.139 --> 509.46000000000004
day and I'm like

507.12 --> 511.259
compared to some other regions like for

509.46 --> 513.7189999999999
example California

511.259 --> 517.399
from what I've heard

513.719 --> 517.399
like I'm not complaining

520.38 --> 524.88
and I really do think that whatever or

522.899 --> 526.5
whoever is in control if there are

524.88 --> 529.04
people in control or just trying to

526.5 --> 529.04
nudge things

529.44 --> 534.44
that they are actually trying to make

532.019 --> 534.44
good weather

552.12 --> 559.279
but who knows really it maybe it's just

555.779 --> 559.279
me trying to be very positive

560.339 --> 563.7
I mean when you don't know you don't

561.959 --> 566.399
know you know

563.7 --> 568.8000000000001
so why not then just see it the positive

566.399 --> 571.86
way and who knows

568.8 --> 575.04
besides just being positive having a

571.86 --> 576.6
positive influence on reality

575.04 --> 581.7199999999999
through yourself

576.6 --> 581.72
maybe it also has a more

583.38 --> 588.79
Direct influence you could say an

586.8 --> 590.04
exemplary influencer resonating

588.79 --> 593.399
[Music]

590.04 --> 596.0
potential so who knows yeah I was just

593.399 --> 598.8
watching some David Ike by the way

596.0 --> 603.06
and he's like yeah this video talking

598.8 --> 605.459
with somebody really esoteric

603.06 --> 606.66
through his own

605.459 --> 609.5
Style

606.66 --> 609.5
it's interesting

609.959 --> 615.42
like I try to describe the yeah the

613.5 --> 617.58
different experiences

615.42 --> 620.0999999999999
and so does he and he uses other words

617.58 --> 622.98
like what I typically call the Dark

620.1 --> 625.8000000000001
World I call it the Dark World to kind

622.98 --> 627.36
of make it more my thing so it is kind

625.8 --> 630.0
of a naming

627.36 --> 633.12
but it's also well empirically for me

630.0 --> 636.14
empirically based on the actual moment

633.12 --> 636.14
where certainly like

637.44 --> 643.32
like sunglasses were slid over my eyes

640.2 --> 646.38
in the dark world but it it wasn't

643.32 --> 649.1600000000001
and like the background lights just

646.38 --> 649.16
stopped

650.279 --> 657.48
right and after that point it was a very

653.579 --> 660.0
long series of just it being like that

657.48 --> 663.12
wasn't always that though originally it

660.0 --> 665.64
wasn't that so and I think that David

663.12 --> 668.579
Ike has had experiences with that size

665.64 --> 671.579
it probably has very similar substance

668.579 --> 675.0
to what I have experienced

671.579 --> 678.8389999999999
but in a much more prepared state

675.0 --> 681.42
with actual Shaman that right that

678.839 --> 684.62
weren't secretly Grabbers

681.42 --> 684.62
big difference

684.899 --> 690.48
protection wise all that I was not

687.6 --> 691.62
protected with me like immediately the

690.48 --> 693.6
devil came

691.62 --> 695.64
that was before it

693.6 --> 699.0
the dark it turned into the dark world

695.64 --> 701.88
but like yeah that's what I've concluded

699.0 --> 704.04
after going through it many times

701.88 --> 706.74
that yeah I was completely unprotected

704.04 --> 711.0
and like this literally after two

706.74 --> 713.22
seconds of having entered that state

711.0 --> 716.64
but just a wet guy

713.22 --> 718.26
or so I thought appeared to me and

716.64 --> 721.6999999999999
started [ __ ] around with me and

718.26 --> 721.7
showing his nasty nature

724.62 --> 730.86
but it probably wasn't him

728.22 --> 733.2
it was probably just inspired on him he

730.86 --> 734.94
just used the devil used his skin

733.2 --> 736.62
because the guy was kind of well

734.94 --> 738.1800000000001
psychopathic

736.62 --> 740.519
yeah

738.18 --> 743.2199999999999
and it was the scariest thing that I've

740.519 --> 748.7
ever scariest person that I've ever met

743.22 --> 748.7
so up close in my life to that point

749.88 --> 755.7
that well that well not scariest but

753.06 --> 757.4399999999999
very yeah

755.7 --> 760.1400000000001
scary

757.44 --> 761.94
but I've seen scarier things before that

760.14 --> 763.92
but it's always stayed very much away

761.94 --> 766.0790000000001
but this was like the first time where I

763.92 --> 771.38
actually had the

766.079 --> 771.38
the hot spots like oh yeah I'm gonna

772.74 --> 779.3
I'm gonna hang with him this is dude

776.88 --> 781.8
don't hang with the Devil

779.3 --> 784.8
metaphorically in this sense he's not

781.8 --> 787.9399999999999
the Flesh and Blood person is not the

784.8 --> 787.9399999999999
devil I I doubt it

790.079 --> 792.7399999999999
it's just to

793.4 --> 798.0
[Music]

795.899 --> 801.019
it just doesn't matter

798.0 --> 801.019
there's yeah

801.72 --> 808.139
but in the experience yeah that happened

804.06 --> 811.0189999999999
he didn't have that happen like that

808.139 --> 812.639
but he calls it the astral realm or the

811.019 --> 815.639
astral space

812.639 --> 818.1
and arguably that is where it takes

815.639 --> 822.6800000000001
place that is what I call the Dark World

818.1 --> 822.6800000000001
so I've just tried to like compare

824.459 --> 830.88
his experiences to mine

827.1 --> 832.8000000000001
that he indirectly yeah he talks about a

830.88 --> 834.3
little bit more indirectly as I do

832.8 --> 836.459
because he

834.3 --> 839.279
doesn't just go back

836.459 --> 841.3199999999999
trying to put the history of his

839.279 --> 843.079
experience literally on the on the

841.32 --> 846.0
Playfield he

843.079 --> 847.8599999999999
transcribes using the experience like

846.0 --> 850.2
what he learned from it but he doesn't

847.86 --> 851.4590000000001
literally like place a time in a day and

850.2 --> 854.82
like

851.459 --> 858.0
maybe here and there he has but

854.82 --> 861.9200000000001
it it's not predominant I tend to like

858.0 --> 861.92
describe a lot of details

862.74 --> 870.899
because it's also sort of like

866.88 --> 870.899
for my oversight

875.22 --> 880.38
I'm I'm trying to basically also keep my

878.04 --> 882.92
my history

880.38 --> 886.5
constructed

882.92 --> 888.8389999999999
by addressing all of it continually

886.5 --> 891.36
because it's really freaking complicated

888.839 --> 895.1600000000001
what happened complicated enough that I

891.36 --> 895.16
could not get a conscious grip

895.86 --> 900.9590000000001
I had to basically trust God but I mean

898.5 --> 902.279
yeah that's a kind of a risky thing when

900.959 --> 906.18
you're like

902.279 --> 908.82
having hotspa and all that you know

906.18 --> 910.5
that's literally a very dangerous

908.82 --> 912.1600000000001
Alchemy

910.5 --> 915.54
and so

912.16 --> 919.519
[Music]

915.54 --> 919.519
I feel I came out of it okay

923.279 --> 927.899
I've always deduced that it was very

925.98 --> 931.6800000000001
torturous

927.899 --> 933.779
because I didn't corrupt

931.68 --> 936.5999999999999
because everybody that's like really

933.779 --> 938.579
corrupted to like that force from the

936.6 --> 941.4590000000001
other side

938.579 --> 943.7399999999999
like regular people because it's not

941.459 --> 945.779
just blue Elite that you see on the town

943.74 --> 947.639
now it's also regular people some of

945.779 --> 949.68
them

947.639 --> 950.699
some people are very easily corruptable

949.68 --> 952.56
it's

950.699 --> 954.18
shocking and like they don't really

952.56 --> 957.4399999999999
stand out too much but they are like

954.18 --> 957.4399999999999
really corrupt on the inside

960.6 --> 964.94
now I'm losing my train of thought sorry

970.04 --> 975.8
it's still hot

972.6 --> 975.8000000000001
I'm gonna get the fan

989.04 --> 995.16
I guess experiences my experiences

992.04 --> 996.54
comparing it oh yeah I'm trying to keep

995.16 --> 999.06
my memory

996.54 --> 1003.079
of the complicated things that happen in

999.06 --> 1004.7589999999999
place by going through it continually

1003.079 --> 1006.8599999999999
because at the time I couldn't

1004.759 --> 1008.9590000000001
cognitively the rasp what was happening

1006.86 --> 1011.54
I just had to trust the flow

1008.959 --> 1014.0
and that my intuition would basically be

1011.54 --> 1016.399
able to distinguish

1014.0 --> 1018.32
everything even though some of it would

1016.399 --> 1020.899
or a lot of it would be like the first

1018.32 --> 1022.22
time ever ever even perceiving something

1020.899 --> 1025.66
like that

1022.22 --> 1025.66
it's a very wild thing

1028.64 --> 1035.48
even got to the point where I'm gonna go

1031.819 --> 1038.6
into detail well like study people's

1035.48 --> 1042.079
obsession with dark things

1038.6 --> 1046.1
and Carnage and things like

1042.079 --> 1048.9189999999999
what exactly about it is

1046.1 --> 1051.4399999999998
what

1048.919 --> 1054.14
what makes it so addictive what what

1051.44 --> 1057.3400000000001
actually happens to them internally that

1054.14 --> 1057.3400000000001
they get caught up in it

1060.64 --> 1066.2800000000002
and so yeah that's all very punishing

1073.46 --> 1078.14
but

1075.2 --> 1080.98
I'd like to think it helped

1078.14 --> 1080.98
although

1081.14 --> 1088.8200000000002
like contentually I can barely remember

1085.7 --> 1091.7
the details it's just that if I'll face

1088.82 --> 1094.76
something that relates to that freak

1091.7 --> 1096.2
those frequencies those things I will

1094.76 --> 1099.2
understand it

1096.2 --> 1104.02
and I think that that is the reason why

1099.2 --> 1104.02
I chose to do that in the Dark World

1104.48 --> 1110.72
it was with a mission

1107.419 --> 1112.4
like to understand it too because I also

1110.72 --> 1115.16
yeah that's part of the motivation that

1112.4 --> 1117.8600000000001
wrote me through all of it is to like

1115.16 --> 1122.1200000000001
I have an extraordinary opportunity to

1117.86 --> 1124.76
master things in a way that is just

1122.12 --> 1129.28
normally impossible

1124.76 --> 1129.28
so I'm gonna try to like grasp things

1129.62 --> 1134.9599999999998
that will not lit in a way that it won't

1132.44 --> 1140.6200000000001
lead to more evil

1134.96 --> 1140.6200000000001
but instead fixing it understanding it

1141.44 --> 1147.919
it's like sin is a mistake

1145.039 --> 1150.1
so why not take the opportunity to study

1147.919 --> 1154.039
sin to

1150.1 --> 1158.059
mastered the mistakes of others like

1154.039 --> 1161.36
that I I haven't done those things

1158.059 --> 1163.58
but other people have and I've like

1161.36 --> 1166.52
sit through that

1163.58 --> 1169.34
like witnessed yeah as I said I've

1166.52 --> 1172.58
witnessed a lot of horrible things

1169.34 --> 1175.6399999999999
and like if I in that moment that I'm

1172.58 --> 1178.22
remembering it I'm not

1175.64 --> 1181.5800000000002
like strong enough

1178.22 --> 1184.46
complete enough including cognitive grip

1181.58 --> 1187.1599999999999
on what it actually was and the reason

1184.46 --> 1189.5
why I was doing that as a whole then

1187.16 --> 1192.14
it's just like ah nightmares like

1189.5 --> 1193.76
terrible torture and [ __ ]

1192.14 --> 1198.0800000000002
like

1193.76 --> 1200.24
from an ignorant entry perspective it's

1198.08 --> 1203.4189999999999
just horrendous

1200.24 --> 1206.48
it's just nightmares a lot of it

1203.419 --> 1209.6000000000001
is like scarring but

1206.48 --> 1212.24
when I remember the Fuller picture

1209.6 --> 1214.9399999999998
and like the earlier Parts like the

1212.24 --> 1217.179
reasons why I started doing that in

1214.94 --> 1217.179
there

1217.34 --> 1222.82
then it's not as wounding because like

1219.559 --> 1222.82
the mission protected me

1223.34 --> 1228.74
even though barely

1226.52 --> 1231.22
if it fully protected me then it

1228.74 --> 1231.22
wouldn't work

1233.059 --> 1239.12
it's complicated very very complicated

1235.88 --> 1241.5200000000002
it's higher dimensional mechanics and I

1239.12 --> 1243.799
it's like can barely explain though it's

1241.52 --> 1246.559
like trying to explain the intricacies

1243.799 --> 1248.059
of like dream mechanics right when I try

1246.559 --> 1249.1399999999999
to explain like I'm digging through

1248.059 --> 1251.4189999999999
stuff

1249.14 --> 1253.76
and they symbolize things and sometimes

1251.419 --> 1257.179
it's things of the current and sometimes

1253.76 --> 1261.14
even of the future of the past and

1257.179 --> 1262.76
that's just an attempt to try that's

1261.14 --> 1265.16
is

1262.76 --> 1266.96
yeah

1265.16 --> 1270.5800000000002
yeah because like hyper dimensional

1266.96 --> 1270.58
experiences like that is just

1271.34 --> 1275.72
there's so many

1273.26 --> 1278.24
barriers are lifted

1275.72 --> 1280.7
through

1278.24 --> 1283.7
the physical rules basically not

1280.7 --> 1285.64
obstructing you

1283.7 --> 1289.039
out there

1285.64 --> 1290.1200000000001
but it is all Consciousness and mind

1289.039 --> 1292.58
though

1290.12 --> 1295.58
like don't expect to go to the Dark

1292.58 --> 1297.08
World to accumulate matter and then take

1295.58 --> 1299.059
it back to you or something magical

1297.08 --> 1301.52
thinking like that is fascinating it was

1299.059 --> 1304.22
I was personally obsessed with that not

1301.52 --> 1306.44
because I wanted to make gold but

1304.22 --> 1308.24
right but at some points I did but not

1306.44 --> 1310.6000000000001
seriously but just because of the

1308.24 --> 1313.82
fascination of like

1310.6 --> 1316.1
materialization of stuff

1313.82 --> 1318.74
From Another Dimension just that concept

1316.1 --> 1321.74
it's just like wow

1318.74 --> 1324.679
is something like that in real

1321.74 --> 1327.38
like never truly given up on that I mean

1324.679 --> 1330.4
I have had things literally like just

1327.38 --> 1330.4
completely disappear

1330.98 --> 1335.84
but never me witnessing it like phasing

1334.039 --> 1338.059
out or anything but

1335.84 --> 1340.3999999999999
like things would just really

1338.059 --> 1345.3799999999999
unexplicably disappear

1340.4 --> 1348.64
very in a yeah it's just like no that's

1345.38 --> 1348.64
what's going on here

1348.919 --> 1351.2
yeah

1350.179 --> 1355.22
anyway

1351.2 --> 1359.0
[Music]

1355.22 --> 1360.08
Jesus is not included in the Bible

1359.0 --> 1361.76
okay

1360.08 --> 1366.3999999999999
yeah

1361.76 --> 1366.4
is David Like A Flat Earth no not really

1367.76 --> 1375.44
he keeps it out of his narrative but I

1371.059 --> 1379.0
mean I met David Ike in 2011.

1375.44 --> 1379.0
he's a pretty cool guy

1381.919 --> 1388.1000000000001
and he like

1385.52 --> 1389.4189999999999
just doesn't really what he said at the

1388.1 --> 1391.9399999999998
time

1389.419 --> 1393.5
was I he didn't really want to get into

1391.94 --> 1396.8600000000001
Flat Earth

1393.5 --> 1399.88
but like he didn't have any like baller

1396.86 --> 1399.8799999999999
allergies or anything

1402.2 --> 1405.74
I think I vaguely remember the

1404.12 --> 1408.08
conversation with because it was pretty

1405.74 --> 1410.24
complicated that it was like

1408.08 --> 1413.4189999999999
the pre-flat Earth Awakening in that

1410.24 --> 1418.0
period that was it 2011 I think because

1413.419 --> 1418.0
he was here in near Utrecht

1418.58 --> 1423.22
was this little sort of like

1426.34 --> 1431.8999999999999
says let's just say Tesla theme text

1429.26 --> 1433.8799999999999
stuff free energy water energy stuff

1431.9 --> 1436.8200000000002
themed

1433.88 --> 1439.0390000000002
sort of like marketing

1436.82 --> 1441.1399999999999
and there were lecturers and David Ike

1439.039 --> 1445.1589999999999
was there and I met him there because

1441.14 --> 1446.659
that was like the pre 2015 Flat Earth

1445.159 --> 1449.0590000000002
Awakening for me

1446.659 --> 1452.2990000000002
and my friend of that time

1449.059 --> 1454.76
who later basically backed down and

1452.299 --> 1456.679
it's like no because he got threatened

1454.76 --> 1458.179
by that weirdo Freemason guy with all

1456.679 --> 1460.7
the medals

1458.179 --> 1462.0800000000002
that I was there

1460.7 --> 1464.24
right

1462.08 --> 1466.22
but I was already really like fanatical

1464.24 --> 1469.4
about Flat Earth at that time it's just

1466.22 --> 1472.419
there was no Community like I was able

1469.4 --> 1472.419
that I knew about

1472.64 --> 1477.98
online

1474.919 --> 1480.2
but I did know about Eric Dubai and

1477.98 --> 1483.32
uh

1480.2 --> 1485.44
math Boyland who he was called at the

1483.32 --> 1485.4399999999998
time

1488.12 --> 1492.559
even though I'm not sure if he actually

1490.22 --> 1494.48
already had videos on the internet in

1492.559 --> 1498.46
2011.

1494.48 --> 1498.46
she makes everything kind of confusing

1499.72 --> 1504.14
but I mean I did have like the Dark

1502.159 --> 1508.419
World Visions where I did see like Eric

1504.14 --> 1508.419
dubey's video and math boyland's video

1509.539 --> 1514.72
so

1511.1 --> 1514.7199999999998
it's kind of complicated

1515.299 --> 1519.9189999999999
huh but I definitely know I met David I

1517.94 --> 1522.6200000000001
had a conversation and confronted with

1519.919 --> 1525.2
flat Earth and I think he just didn't

1522.62 --> 1528.3999999999999
like that

1525.2 --> 1528.4
it was too toxic

1531.08 --> 1535.3999999999999
he had to evade it

1533.72 --> 1537.559
but I think even like said like yeah

1535.4 --> 1539.9
good luck

1537.559 --> 1542.299
so he was not in like an anti-flat earth

1539.9 --> 1544.48
he's just like I can't get involved with

1542.299 --> 1544.48
this

1544.7 --> 1549.38
directly

1547.159 --> 1551.5390000000002
although I bet that

1549.38 --> 1553.5800000000002
at some point he might or he might have

1551.539 --> 1556.82
already like had

1553.58 --> 1560.559
not a debate but conversations with flat

1556.82 --> 1560.559
earthers including about Flat Earth

1561.26 --> 1567.2
he might he might do that at some point

1564.14 --> 1569.8600000000001
as sort of a neutral friendly

1567.2 --> 1569.8600000000001
so

1570.38 --> 1575.2600000000002
yeah he's about to reptilians and

1575.539 --> 1581.98
yep

1577.94 --> 1581.98
I've seen reptilians in the Dark World

1583.159 --> 1586.72
I didn't think they were that bad

1588.38 --> 1594.2600000000002
they were just like yeah they just

1591.44 --> 1597.8600000000001
like reptiles but I mean

1594.26 --> 1600.94
it's just another like social priority

1597.86 --> 1600.9399999999998
system mostly

1601.46 --> 1604.72
it's a little different

1607.94 --> 1613.039
but I'm not even sure that like they are

1610.4 --> 1616.659
literally like another physical species

1613.039 --> 1616.6589999999999
I think that they are like

1618.62 --> 1624.4399999999998
potentially Spirit forms it's like

1621.26 --> 1627.32
that's what you become

1624.44 --> 1630.14
but your spirit on the other side turns

1627.32 --> 1633.2
into or something like that right I mean

1630.14 --> 1635.419
is there a definitive knowledge about

1633.2 --> 1638.8600000000001
what happens with that stuff I think

1635.419 --> 1638.8600000000001
that what I just literally

1639.799 --> 1644.32
puzzle together is probably

1644.779 --> 1649.34
what it is

1646.88 --> 1651.98
I don't know though it literally just

1649.34 --> 1653.8999999999999
came to me but it has like

1651.98 --> 1655.76
people

1653.9 --> 1658.46
when they start talking about these

1655.76 --> 1660.44
kinds of experiences they just put down

1658.46 --> 1662.8400000000001
an interesting story but they don't

1660.44 --> 1665.179
really think about the logical mechanics

1662.84 --> 1667.039
of it you see that's where I come in

1665.179 --> 1669.5590000000002
this is where our our wins territory

1667.039 --> 1672.26
Spirit mechanics like okay let's now

1669.559 --> 1674.36
actually take this serious

1672.26 --> 1677.299
and figure out

1674.36 --> 1680.74
the patterns of it the logical patterns

1677.299 --> 1680.74
of what that is

1684.14 --> 1688.7
right let's analyze the spiritual

1686.299 --> 1691.76
metadata so the more detail somebody

1688.7 --> 1694.52
gives with his experience relaying what

1691.76 --> 1698.24
they felt and the detail of it and what

1694.52 --> 1700.1589999999999
it related to and how things looked how

1698.24 --> 1702.679
things responded

1700.159 --> 1703.94
what the knowledge was of like what

1702.679 --> 1706.039
they're looking at did they know it's

1703.94 --> 1707.3600000000001
like a Holodeck like experience or that

1706.039 --> 1708.62
they really think it's like another

1707.36 --> 1710.84
place

1708.62 --> 1712.4599999999998
did they have control over things

1710.84 --> 1714.8799999999999
unexpectedly

1712.46 --> 1717.919
or naturally like they didn't even

1714.88 --> 1719.0590000000002
realize that that normally isn't normal

1717.919 --> 1721.039
like

1719.059 --> 1723.52
details

1721.039 --> 1723.52
yeah

1739.76 --> 1743.299
anyway

1740.799 --> 1745.34
I'm gonna get

1743.299 --> 1746.07
sip of this

1745.34 --> 1747.9189999999999
weird

1746.07 --> 1750.62
[Music]

1747.919 --> 1754.3600000000001
oh so good

1750.62 --> 1754.36
I'm such a Gusto chill

1757.179 --> 1764.0590000000002
all natural organic energy drink

1762.44 --> 1766.3990000000001
plenty of

1764.059 --> 1769.039
Botanicals

1766.399 --> 1774.52
lots of ginseng

1769.039 --> 1774.52
th really awesome in a heat wave

1775.039 --> 1781.279
to be found at your local organic

1777.5 --> 1784.279
grocery store at least in Europe

1781.279 --> 1784.279
foreign

1788.919 --> 1792.7990000000002
that's such a shame man

1791.299 --> 1795.62
you should really have that stuff

1792.799 --> 1798.559
imported it's awesome

1795.62 --> 1801.799
I mean for how good this is I'm

1798.559 --> 1804.02
surprised it's that cheap and please

1801.799 --> 1807.279
uh

1804.02 --> 1807.279
make it more expensive

1814.419 --> 1819.0200000000002
it's definitely my favorite drink

1817.82 --> 1822.799
but

1819.02 --> 1824.6589999999999
it does I guess have caffeine in it

1822.799 --> 1827.72
but when it's hot

1824.659 --> 1829.22
I can handle it as long as I keep it to

1827.72 --> 1830.539
one

1829.22 --> 1833.559
right

1830.539 --> 1833.559
anyway cheers

1842.659 --> 1846.7
and The Taste is just

1847.159 --> 1852.3400000000001
perfect

1848.779 --> 1852.34
for heat perfect

1855.05 --> 1859.58
[Music]

1857.36 --> 1862.1589999999999
I do recommend it that you basically

1859.58 --> 1863.299
keep it as cool as possible though and

1862.159 --> 1865.3400000000001
like

1863.299 --> 1868.58
when you get it

1865.34 --> 1871.779
out of the cooler open

1868.58 --> 1874.039
that's the way like as cold as possible

1871.779 --> 1875.96
it's great

1874.039 --> 1879.08
well don't don't get it like near

1875.96 --> 1882.26
freezing or anything but like good and

1879.08 --> 1884.48
really cool because it it does have a

1882.26 --> 1886.96
tendency I guess to like warm up pretty

1884.48 --> 1886.96
quickly

1894.919 --> 1897.919
ah

1901.82 --> 1905.899
right I can't believe this stuff is

1903.799 --> 1908.62
around since 1990.

1905.899 --> 1908.62
it's amazing

1908.779 --> 1913.94
I bet they've gotten like a lot of

1911.72 --> 1915.32
that the original wasn't that super

1913.94 --> 1919.3600000000001
great

1915.32 --> 1919.36
and they just really figured it out

1920.179 --> 1926.0590000000002
I mean a drink that's literally this

1922.46 --> 1927.38
good in 1990 that's no way

1926.059 --> 1930.279
like

1927.38 --> 1930.279
that's sick

1930.74 --> 1938.1200000000001
how the hell did I miss out on that

1933.32 --> 1940.6589999999999
I mean if I had this drink in 1990 that

1938.12 --> 1940.6589999999999
dude

1949.399 --> 1953.86
oh and it's fair trade too woohoo

1955.039 --> 1958.22
training

1956.419 --> 1967.0
Epic

1958.22 --> 1967.0
fair trade organic vegan oil yeah I mean

1968.059 --> 1972.52
yeah I nominate this to like

1973.039 --> 1977.419
best drinker

1975.49 --> 1981.039
[Music]

1977.419 --> 1981.039
potentially of this entry

1984.98 --> 1989.1200000000001
right so enough Shilling I'm not even

1987.559 --> 1990.72
getting paid for this it's just because

1989.12 --> 1993.4399999999998
I'm really liking the drink

1990.72 --> 1996.08
[Music]

1993.44 --> 1998.8990000000001
yeah I'm not having Illuminati croissant

1996.08 --> 2001.96
today it's just too freaking hot

1998.899 --> 2004.62
and I had a really good dinner yesterday

2001.96 --> 2004.6200000000001
it's great

2005.679 --> 2012.3400000000001
I'm stepping away a bit from like french

2008.019 --> 2015.779
fries and I'm like going to like just

2012.34 --> 2015.779
boiled potatoes

2017.79 --> 2025.12
[Music]

2021.88 --> 2027.7
it's like I like french fries

2025.12 --> 2029.62
but boiled potatoes is like yeah you can

2027.7 --> 2032.919
just do that with mayonnaise too it's

2029.62 --> 2035.5
like yeah different

2032.919 --> 2038.7990000000002
less taste explosiony

2035.5 --> 2041.14
but my system just handles it much

2038.799 --> 2043.0
better I've noticed

2041.14 --> 2045.3400000000001
so I'm wondering if I'm actually going

2043.0 --> 2047.44
to go to another step and I always have

2045.34 --> 2049.54
to keep improving on the my diet and

2047.44 --> 2052.96
stuff and just

2049.54 --> 2055.839
the more basic and efficient the better

2052.96 --> 2058.679
because that's just so cost and health

2055.839 --> 2058.679
saving

2060.04 --> 2063.0
would like to change

2065.98 --> 2070.979
I'm gonna figure it out

2067.78 --> 2070.9790000000003
[Music]

2073.48 --> 2078.52
right is my chat dry what's what's going

2076.3 --> 2080.679
on here hey dank good to see you by the

2078.52 --> 2082.599
way I didn't see you there

2080.679 --> 2085.839
because she got the same

2082.599 --> 2088.8590000000004
color schemas fiber oats

2085.839 --> 2088.859
your kitties

2090.639 --> 2095.099
your kitty just looks like what is that

2097.18 --> 2103.44
painting

2098.859 --> 2103.44
yeah like that painting same color

2104.68 --> 2107.2799999999997
oh

2111.28 --> 2114.76
how's the temperature where you're at

2112.9 --> 2117.82
dank

2114.76 --> 2120.4
everybody all else it seems to be in a

2117.82 --> 2123.52
in a short cool off spell

2120.4 --> 2126.339
which is great for them

2123.52 --> 2129.04
it's just that I already had a long cool

2126.339 --> 2131.46
off spell before this mini hit wave

2129.04 --> 2131.46
started

2133.18 --> 2138.2999999999997
it's hot here ah you got the same as I

2135.28 --> 2138.3
do all right

2143.68 --> 2148.54
make sure to keep hydrated I think that

2145.78 --> 2150.1600000000003
it's like pretty moist with this heat it

2148.54 --> 2151.96
is here at least

2150.16 --> 2156.3999999999996
and the weird thing is that the more

2151.96 --> 2160.2
moist it is the quicker you lose fluids

2156.4 --> 2160.2000000000003
so make sure to keep track of that

2160.3 --> 2163.119
all right that's why it like in the

2162.04 --> 2165.7599999999998
jungle

2163.119 --> 2168.9
moist level is pretty extreme and like

2165.76 --> 2168.9
people like

2169.72 --> 2175.66
oh I'm thirsty oh I'm gonna ignore it

2172.48 --> 2180.04
and then at like an hour later they just

2175.66 --> 2184.2999999999997
faint fall over from dehydration

2180.04 --> 2187.18
like yeah moist when it's warm sucks you

2184.3 --> 2188.5600000000004
dry quicker than a desert

2187.18 --> 2191.02
really

2188.56 --> 2194.0789999999997
although a desert can like direct sun

2191.02 --> 2196.92
can literally just boil you so that's

2194.079 --> 2196.92
different Danger

2199.0 --> 2203.2
you guys going back live on the FED next

2202.119 --> 2206.1600000000003
week

2203.2 --> 2206.16
I no doubt

2211.0 --> 2217.599
by the way if Nathan is

2214.3 --> 2220.3590000000004
then as long as this heat wave lasts I

2217.599 --> 2222.76
am gonna do very short shows if none

2220.359 --> 2224.02
shows do what I've been

2222.76 --> 2226.8390000000004
doing

2224.02 --> 2228.94
three to four hour shows like

2226.839 --> 2231.94
Non-Stop

2228.94 --> 2233.7400000000002
and with this heat I just I'm liking it

2231.94 --> 2236.28
I'm liking it but I feel at the same

2233.74 --> 2236.2799999999997
time man

2236.44 --> 2241.78
this is gonna wear me out I kind of need

2239.38 --> 2243.76
to break it a bit

2241.78 --> 2245.8
so yeah

2243.76 --> 2247.5400000000004
if Nathan's going to be back at the

2245.8 --> 2249.3390000000004
normal time I'm probably gonna do

2247.54 --> 2253.2
shorter shows

2249.339 --> 2253.2
until the heat wave is kind of over

2253.3 --> 2259.7200000000003
because I mean today at one o'clock it's

2257.2 --> 2262.96
undoable even without a shirt

2259.72 --> 2266.02
it's just too freaking hot

2262.96 --> 2269.8
the Sun hitting is like potentially

2266.02 --> 2271.599
hitting me if I go like this no way that

2269.8 --> 2274.54
I'm gonna like do a show when it's that

2271.599 --> 2278.92
hot no way

2274.54 --> 2282.16
yeah by the way how you like my uh man

2278.92 --> 2284.98
boob thing that I think I had sort of a

2282.16 --> 2287.6189999999997
while back not barely though seems to

2284.98 --> 2289.839
have like completely lifted

2287.619 --> 2292.859
I don't know why but

2289.839 --> 2292.859
I'm liking it

2293.14 --> 2296.46
I feel more manly

2298.62 --> 2304.5
[Music]

2300.88 --> 2304.5
take that open Benjamin

2304.78 --> 2308.98

2306.94 --> 2312.339
challenge

2308.98 --> 2315.88
see if you dare oh and sorry you don't

2312.339 --> 2319.14
have to if it's super hot then maybe

2315.88 --> 2319.1400000000003
that will be interesting

2319.24 --> 2323.2
it's up to you

2321.28 --> 2327.0400000000004
but I mean he's always talked about like

2323.2 --> 2330.64
he's for he has I'm just

2327.04 --> 2334.06
I'm just crying no

2330.64 --> 2336.04
I have no weight issues I never did

2334.06 --> 2340.119
like even when I like really stuck

2336.04 --> 2342.72
myself and like drank beer and

2340.119 --> 2346.7200000000003
I had a time in around

2342.72 --> 2346.72
between 2019

2348.16 --> 2356.8199999999997
and 2000 uh 2019 what no 1999

2355.66 --> 2362.7599999999998
and

2356.82 --> 2362.76
2003 where I basically ate dinner twice

2362.859 --> 2370.18
I would like have dinner

2366.16 --> 2372.8199999999997
then yeah go to my girlfriend

2370.18 --> 2376.1189999999997
then come back

2372.82 --> 2378.7000000000003
home and then drink a beer and eat a

2376.119 --> 2382.3
pizza and I was like

2378.7 --> 2385.5989999999997
just buzzing it was Fantastical it was

2382.3 --> 2388.54
like the first real

2385.599 --> 2392.02
worthy the first girl that actually had

2388.54 --> 2394.0
something a real spirit

2392.02 --> 2399.04
that I met through my father by the way

2394.0 --> 2402.04
she was actually like his guitar student

2399.04 --> 2404.8
so usually any girl that has any musical

2402.04 --> 2407.2
quality like there's that will

2404.8 --> 2410.44
make the love potential much greater

2407.2 --> 2411.7
it's like a a multiplier Factor doesn't

2410.44 --> 2414.04
mean that's always going to be there's

2411.7 --> 2416.2599999999998
plenty women that are music that are

2414.04 --> 2418.66
also like

2416.26 --> 2421.3
kind of twisted or whatever they do not

2418.66 --> 2423.52
find that attractive

2421.3 --> 2427.38
maybe in my golf days I would have gone

2423.52 --> 2427.38
for that but I know better now

2431.38 --> 2436.7200000000003
well yeah well then that comes yeah my

2433.06 --> 2439.74
ex could ex could sing really amazing

2436.72 --> 2439.74
classical voice

2442.24 --> 2447.66
but anyway

2444.64 --> 2447.66
what was I talking about

2452.56 --> 2459.64
oh yeah my ex the like that's like from

2456.4 --> 2461.7400000000002
a long time ago not my last ex

2459.64 --> 2465.9
not uh

2461.74 --> 2465.8999999999996
but back then yeah I ate a lot

2466.359 --> 2472.24
and yeah I would get just

2469.48 --> 2474.339
it was like just a little layer I would

2472.24 --> 2477.22
just get like a little bit of more baby

2474.339 --> 2480.099
fetish and it's like yeah

2477.22 --> 2482.6189999999997
when I was annoying or whatever like

2480.099 --> 2484.9
people would like say fatty or something

2482.619 --> 2486.6400000000003
for the fun of it even but it wasn't

2484.9 --> 2489.64
because it's like oh you're looking at

2486.64 --> 2491.7999999999997
me and then just like fat no it's when

2489.64 --> 2493.18
you look up close you kind of could tell

2491.8 --> 2494.38
like yeah you're

2493.18 --> 2498.16
[Music]

2494.38 --> 2501.6400000000003
you seem a little slightly bloated just

2498.16 --> 2503.3799999999997
slightly not not like shape changing

2501.64 --> 2505.66
bloody

2503.38 --> 2509.82
but that's as fat as I got

2505.66 --> 2512.68
guys I don't get that I do get

2509.82 --> 2514.9
unbelievably skinny however

2512.68 --> 2517.8999999999996
dude when I was with my ex

2514.9 --> 2520.859
I was so skinny I could literally get

2517.9 --> 2520.859
around my waist

2521.2 --> 2526.5989999999997
like that I can't believe that that was

2524.079 --> 2527.619
possible and like well after my ex that

2526.599 --> 2531.04
just

2527.619 --> 2533.2200000000003
it's like I barely just popped out of

2531.04 --> 2533.22
there

2537.339 --> 2542.14
but I mean I was just incredibly skinny

2540.46 --> 2544.54
down there

2542.14 --> 2547.42
and I could like make it seem like

2544.54 --> 2550.32
skeleton like creepy

2547.42 --> 2554.26
and that was even

2550.32 --> 2556.7200000000003
when and in between yeah it was after I

2554.26 --> 2558.28
kind of I didn't drink and after I

2556.72 --> 2562.54
stopped drinking beer because I did

2558.28 --> 2565.599
drink beer regularly for like a decade

2562.54 --> 2568.359
not like every day like I have in the

2565.599 --> 2571.1800000000003
last couple of years but just regularly

2568.359 --> 2573.52
like every weekend like a bunch

2571.18 --> 2575.74
every weekend would be like seven or ten

2573.52 --> 2578.98
or something depending on how crazy it

2575.74 --> 2581.0789999999997
got at 10 I would get sick definitely

2578.98 --> 2583.619
good

2581.079 --> 2587.02
but uh

2583.619 --> 2588.579
keep dwelling I'm losing track of what

2587.02 --> 2592.3
I'm saying

2588.579 --> 2594.8390000000004
I didn't get super fat from it

2592.3 --> 2597.94
I can get really skinny but so yeah

2594.839 --> 2600.5789999999997
there were there was something I guess

2597.94 --> 2602.26
and when is it the last two years maybe

2600.579 --> 2603.6400000000003
it's the beer

2602.26 --> 2605.98
I guess

2603.64 --> 2609.46
wouldn't you guys say

2605.98 --> 2611.26
it must have been the beer

2609.46 --> 2612.54
because I didn't really have it before

2611.26 --> 2615.94
that

2612.54 --> 2619.119
I didn't really have it

2615.94 --> 2622.359
even when I was like 21

2619.119 --> 2625.9
and drinking beer like one or two beer

2622.359 --> 2628.839
which would be like

2625.9 --> 2631.1800000000003
the third or two-thirds of a liter

2628.839 --> 2633.52
no more because I didn't need more man

2631.18 --> 2635.44
I've always been so sensitive to alcohol

2633.52 --> 2639.099
it's like

2635.44 --> 2641.319
my cousin is an alcoholic and he's not

2639.099 --> 2643.119
there anymore unfortunately

2641.319 --> 2644.74
and he would like keep on chugging

2643.119 --> 2648.28
because he like said he didn't feel

2644.74 --> 2651.2799999999997
anything and I'm like bro

2648.28 --> 2653.26
that freaks me out like after one beer I

2651.28 --> 2655.02
am [ __ ] feeling it

2653.26 --> 2659.2200000000003
like I will

2655.02 --> 2662.02
absolutely feel it and like that still

2659.22 --> 2663.8799999999997
absolutely true it's like I don't get

2662.02 --> 2665.5
how people just

2663.88 --> 2668.859
they pour that in there and I'm like

2665.5 --> 2671.619
holy [ __ ] if that was my body that you

2668.859 --> 2675.2999999999997
would be pouring that into like I would

2671.619 --> 2675.3
like really freak out

2676.0 --> 2681.88
like get like weird

2678.94 --> 2684.54
yeah basically alcohol poisoning or

2681.88 --> 2684.54
something like that

2685.06 --> 2689.619
oh thanks for sharing it Nathan

2692.619 --> 2697.6600000000003
but uh yeah

2694.78 --> 2700.0
they seem to have gone since I've

2697.66 --> 2703.06
stopped drinking beer earlier January

2700.0 --> 2705.88
and I'm very happy that I'm like sort of

2703.06 --> 2708.72
like man more manly looking

2705.88 --> 2708.7200000000003
yeah

2708.76 --> 2714.76
because I am all for bare-chested men

2711.4 --> 2716.8
thing like I not that I oh I love it but

2714.76 --> 2719.6800000000003
it's just like yeah that's cool that's

2716.8 --> 2721.599
manly women like it and I like that

2719.68 --> 2724.839
women like it

2721.599 --> 2727.839
but do bro you gotta It's gotta look

2724.839 --> 2730.44
good though you can't just be a gross

2727.839 --> 2730.44
Goblin

2730.54 --> 2733.079
you know

2733.66 --> 2741.52
so by this looking better I feel I have

2737.98 --> 2745.54
more the right to actually expose it

2741.52 --> 2748.06
and it's like yay I won not having to

2745.54 --> 2750.819
wear a t-shirt online

2748.06 --> 2755.64
so I can they could like cool down a bit

2750.819 --> 2755.64
hooray thank the god thank God

2761.5 --> 2766.26
right

2763.24 --> 2766.2599999999998
anyway it's hot

2767.92 --> 2773.26
an old Benjamin officially has a bear

2770.26 --> 2776.88
chest challenge to show off I mean the

2773.26 --> 2776.88
guy has been working out a lot

2777.099 --> 2783.339
okay

2779.26 --> 2786.28
so I'm actually really rooting for him

2783.339 --> 2789.48
I I really I think he can't do it but I

2786.28 --> 2789.48
think it's also like

2792.4 --> 2797.319
you need some like some smart

2794.38 --> 2799.3
supplementation like some real careful

2797.319 --> 2800.56
measure check

2799.3 --> 2803.38
like

2800.56 --> 2806.98
not necessarily like weird chemicals and

2803.38 --> 2809.88
stuff although the dude

2806.98 --> 2809.88
figure it out

2809.98 --> 2815.38
but I mean I really hope that he can

2812.02 --> 2818.319
like look more like a Spartan at some

2815.38 --> 2820.56
point without it being all steroids and

2818.319 --> 2820.56
[ __ ]

2820.96 --> 2825.579
because you can do that I think

2823.54 --> 2827.5
I mean you're not gonna look like Arnold

2825.579 --> 2829.7200000000003
Schwarzenegger

2827.5 --> 2831.22
in his prime you know

2829.72 --> 2834.819
but

2831.22 --> 2836.4399999999996
you can look really freaking cool and

2834.819 --> 2838.66
manly

2836.44 --> 2841.78
and also

2838.66 --> 2844.24
feel really good in your skin right

2841.78 --> 2846.8390000000004
that's something that steroids doesn't

2844.24 --> 2846.839
really do

2847.119 --> 2852.1600000000003
yeah that's the weird thing about

2849.339 --> 2853.599
steroids it like and I don't know this

2852.16 --> 2855.2799999999997
from personal experience but I have

2853.599 --> 2857.6800000000003
known people

2855.28 --> 2860.619
that have like done that Jesuit guy even

2857.68 --> 2862.4199999999996
done that at some point very young

2860.619 --> 2865.119
it's freaky

2862.42 --> 2869.44
but he he didn't like the last time I

2865.119 --> 2871.1800000000003
saw him he was not muscle at all so he

2869.44 --> 2874.42
definitely didn't like continue to do it

2871.18 --> 2877.18
was for a training thing

2874.42 --> 2880.2000000000003
just with stuff love that I'm not gonna

2877.18 --> 2880.2
go any further detail

2882.16 --> 2885.64
but it doesn't make you feel good in

2884.56 --> 2888.52
your skin

2885.64 --> 2890.44
it it pumps you up

2888.52 --> 2892.9
and then

2890.44 --> 2897.359
it's like I personally would just

2892.9 --> 2897.359
continually go rage win more easily

2898.18 --> 2904.359
it invites rage to take control more

2901.96 --> 2906.339
easily that's what it does and it

2904.359 --> 2907.06
doesn't make you feel better in your

2906.339 --> 2910.66
skin

2907.06 --> 2912.7599999999998
right yeah it'll beef you up you you can

2910.66 --> 2914.56
be more intimidating but also well

2912.76 --> 2916.6600000000003
because of the anger

2914.56 --> 2918.88
anger is very intimidating especially

2916.66 --> 2920.02
when somebody's very muscle

2918.88 --> 2925.2400000000002
right

2920.02 --> 2928.66
but it doesn't give you calm confidence

2925.24 --> 2930.7599999999998
you don't feel better in your body

2928.66 --> 2932.92
because you beef yourself up with

2930.76 --> 2937.0600000000004
steroids

2932.92 --> 2939.52
it it doesn't give you like a relief

2937.06 --> 2943.2
for this the stride

2939.52 --> 2943.2
well if you do it another way

2943.24 --> 2947.56
you're gonna not be as beefed up

2945.46 --> 2950.2
it's not going to be as quick

2947.56 --> 2952.18
very careful very controlled it's going

2950.2 --> 2954.46
to be more about personal discipline and

2952.18 --> 2958.06
food discipline but not just like oh

2954.46 --> 2962.44
don't take that cookie but like like

2958.06 --> 2964.98
no no don't even think in terms of meals

2962.44 --> 2967.839
like

2964.98 --> 2969.7
exactly what like what goes in the body

2967.839 --> 2971.2599999999998
what goes out in the body and then just

2969.7 --> 2972.819
really figure out what's this chemistry

2971.26 --> 2975.88
that I have

2972.819 --> 2978.2799999999997
what is it that my body really needs how

2975.88 --> 2981.52
does my body really work let's not just

2978.28 --> 2984.52
go by standard patterns but how does my

2981.52 --> 2989.2599999999998
body really work based on my empirical

2984.52 --> 2992.5
data by you yourself testing it and

2989.26 --> 2994.0
keeping track it's like it's like basic

2992.5 --> 2995.68
testing of like

2994.0 --> 2999.099
how much

2995.68 --> 3000.8999999999996
food is too much for me and then when it

2999.099 --> 3004.2200000000003
is too much what are the symptoms how do

3000.9 --> 3004.2200000000003
I tell that it is too much

3004.44 --> 3009.2400000000002
and what are the long-term consequences

3006.24 --> 3011.819
short-term consequences is there a sort

3009.24 --> 3014.04
of Advantage like oh this is the last

3011.819 --> 3015.9
moment you can eat for a while is it

3014.04 --> 3018.599
advantageous to stuff yourself more

3015.9 --> 3021.78
right all these things

3018.599 --> 3024.2400000000002
the result of that kind of testing will

3021.78 --> 3027.1400000000003
differ per people

3024.24 --> 3030.5989999999997
because their physiology is like

3027.14 --> 3032.7
balanced differently

3030.599 --> 3034.98
so you gotta like know your own

3032.7 --> 3036.48
limitations you gotta basically do

3034.98 --> 3039.9
things wrong

3036.48 --> 3043.26
get carried away and then find out what

3039.9 --> 3045.54
happened and then not just oh if I eat

3043.26 --> 3046.5
too much or I get stuffed and I feel

3045.54 --> 3049.5
sick

3046.5 --> 3051.119
not good but just like no what exactly

3049.5 --> 3054.0
happens then

3051.119 --> 3056.6400000000003
okay and like is it different when you

3054.0 --> 3058.5
stuff yourself with this type of food or

3056.64 --> 3061.22
that type of food

3058.5 --> 3061.22
and

3061.44 --> 3065.4
I mean of course stuffing yourself all

3063.96 --> 3067.26
the time is never gonna be good that

3065.4 --> 3070.6800000000003
you're going to be over saturating

3067.26 --> 3072.3
but is it like okay to eat like a lion

3070.68 --> 3074.819
right

3072.3 --> 3076.619
you just like don't eat a lot and then

3074.819 --> 3078.48
at some point it's like the hunger comes

3076.619 --> 3080.7000000000003
and then you eat just a gigantic meal

3078.48 --> 3084.2
there's people that eat like that

3080.7 --> 3084.2
and that works for them

3084.48 --> 3089.94
but if you do that like every two days

3087.119 --> 3093.0
yeah you'll get really sick

3089.94 --> 3095.099
right you you have to figure it out for

3093.0 --> 3097.38
yourself figure out your own physiology

3095.099 --> 3098.46
like how that works and then when you

3097.38 --> 3101.099
know

3098.46 --> 3103.559
then you can like start to tame it and

3101.099 --> 3106.1400000000003
direct it and like this is

3103.559 --> 3108.059
like you have to figure out what you can

3106.14 --> 3110.339
get out of you

3108.059 --> 3111.96
and then once you know once you figure

3110.339 --> 3115.319
that out then

3111.96 --> 3116.64
you manage it but always keep entropy in

3115.319 --> 3119.88
mind

3116.64 --> 3122.04
as you grow older efficiency is like the

3119.88 --> 3125.1600000000003
functionality of certain things will

3122.04 --> 3127.68
diminish slightly they will have to like

3125.16 --> 3129.42
rearrange how you approach things

3127.68 --> 3133.5789999999997
you always have to keep that in mind

3129.42 --> 3135.96
because if you like have one specific

3133.579 --> 3137.7000000000003
combination of how you do things and

3135.96 --> 3140.46
that's like the only way you could do it

3137.7 --> 3142.4399999999996
then at some point you will arrive at

3140.46 --> 3144.119
the point where literally you can't do

3142.44 --> 3146.28
that anymore and then suddenly

3144.119 --> 3148.26
everything about your life is just

3146.28 --> 3151.2000000000003
completely gone

3148.26 --> 3153.2400000000002
and that can actually be so demoralizing

3151.2 --> 3155.7599999999998
on your system which certainly cannot

3153.24 --> 3157.6189999999997
continue from the normal functions

3155.76 --> 3159.3590000000004
that that could demoralize you to the

3157.619 --> 3160.92
point where you die

3159.359 --> 3163.38
from it

3160.92 --> 3165.42
it's also the same thing that causes

3163.38 --> 3167.28
some people that go to pension that's

3165.42 --> 3170.7000000000003
been hard workers and suddenly they stop

3167.28 --> 3175.6800000000003
and then they die very quickly

3170.7 --> 3178.5
because suddenly they stop doing things

3175.68 --> 3180.7799999999997
they they had to broke the routine and

3178.5 --> 3183.54
that can be quite a System Shock if you

3180.78 --> 3186.559
don't replace the same level of activity

3183.54 --> 3186.5589999999997
you see

3186.9 --> 3195.44
a wise pensioner that has an intense job

3192.0 --> 3195.44
whether they like it or not

3195.96 --> 3199.98
whether they like their job or not I

3197.76 --> 3202.92
mean should always

3199.98 --> 3205.7400000000002
try to figure out like okay if I'm gonna

3202.92 --> 3210.48
go retirement I need a replacement

3205.74 --> 3212.9399999999996
activity that's roughly or at least

3210.48 --> 3214.98
at least like halfway or something to

3212.94 --> 3217.2000000000003
the same level of intensity that is

3214.98 --> 3221.099
required to do

3217.2 --> 3223.4399999999996
so it's like a replacement job

3221.099 --> 3225.059
but with the priority not being oh I

3223.44 --> 3228.42
have to keep making money but I have to

3225.059 --> 3232.46
continue my activity so you can slowly

3228.42 --> 3232.46
over time build it down

3232.859 --> 3238.2599999999998
and that way

3234.54 --> 3241.74
you can prevent a System Shock

3238.26 --> 3243.98
from suddenly your activities are just

3241.74 --> 3243.9799999999996
gone

3254.819 --> 3260.04
I can't lift weights or grab my arm well

3261.66 --> 3266.94
there were all kinds of things that I

3263.579 --> 3269.46
could do that I really not am like

3266.94 --> 3270.66
I'm not even halfway as flexible as I

3269.46 --> 3273.359
used to be

3270.66 --> 3276.0589999999997
although that like When approaching

3273.359 --> 3278.66
things smart I can be very effectively

3276.059 --> 3278.6600000000003
flexible

3279.059 --> 3282.8390000000004
it's just I have to approach it more

3280.859 --> 3284.339
like a Yoda way now

3282.839 --> 3287.0
it's not something that I could just

3284.339 --> 3290.04
automatically keep doing all the time

3287.0 --> 3292.079
but I can have moments of like really

3290.04 --> 3294.96
extreme flexibility that's like very

3292.079 --> 3297.7200000000003
unusual for somebody my age

3294.96 --> 3298.559
you could find it more regularly with

3297.72 --> 3302.7599999999998
like

3298.559 --> 3304.98
pure Africans of my age they still have

3302.76 --> 3306.119
incredible flexibility at like in their

3304.98 --> 3310.22
40s

3306.119 --> 3310.2200000000003
if they've taken good care of their body

3313.68 --> 3315.859
right

3319.14 --> 3324.48
but I mean you got the system in it so

3322.14 --> 3326.72
it's up to you like are you gonna do it

3324.48 --> 3326.72
back

3327.0 --> 3331.559
are you

3328.14 --> 3333.96
like if you miss it if your body misses

3331.559 --> 3335.6400000000003
it if you feel you're less for not doing

3333.96 --> 3338.52
it then just

3335.64 --> 3341.52
start back up again start small if you

3338.52 --> 3343.94
need to right I mean I have very basic

3341.52 --> 3343.94
weights

3345.68 --> 3350.94
I guess it's more like of the female

3348.24 --> 3355.16
class weights I don't care it's like

3350.94 --> 3355.16
sometimes just a little bit

3355.68 --> 3360.48
can be very stimulating especially if

3358.44 --> 3362.28
there's like this strong motivation in

3360.48 --> 3364.619
you about something

3362.28 --> 3368.3390000000004
right

3364.619 --> 3371.1600000000003
workout video with naked Arwen

3368.339 --> 3374.16
Sunday live

3371.16 --> 3374.16
yay

3376.92 --> 3380.78
yeah these are three kilograms

3386.4 --> 3390.92
now I'm all sweaty again what the hell

3388.5 --> 3390.92
am I doing

3395.7 --> 3402.0
slow run control oh did I do it wrong

3399.119 --> 3404.339
I'm sorry I've never actually had

3402.0 --> 3406.079
I never ever went to the gym or had

3404.339 --> 3408.319
actually had actual trainers or

3406.079 --> 3408.319
something

3413.22 --> 3417.0
I just have a couple of way I just have

3415.44 --> 3419.819
moments where I'm like I gotta do

3417.0 --> 3422.0
something like that now that's when I do

3419.819 --> 3422.0
it

3427.74 --> 3434.5789999999997
get a five gallon bucket and fill it

3430.2 --> 3437.48
with very things you mean with dirt

3434.579 --> 3437.48
a dirt bucket

3439.74 --> 3444.319
you're trying to turn me into Coddington

3441.66 --> 3444.319
dank

3455.52 --> 3460.819
this body weight exercise there almost

3457.5 --> 3460.819
the best anyway yeah

3461.52 --> 3469.5
well my overall sporting

3465.059 --> 3471.96
replacement strategy for a long time

3469.5 --> 3473.22
have been almost like ideological it's

3471.96 --> 3477.059
like

3473.22 --> 3479.8799999999997
if I'm gonna do an activity for whatever

3477.059 --> 3484.26
reason even Logistics

3479.88 --> 3485.94
I must do it at a high level as a sport

3484.26 --> 3488.7000000000003
so if I'm going to be on a bike I'm

3485.94 --> 3492.119
going to bike like a master

3488.7 --> 3493.98
like I never got into an accident ever

3492.119 --> 3495.96
like even if it's somebody else that

3493.98 --> 3498.0
would cause it because I can I'm so

3495.96 --> 3500.28
[ __ ] alert

3498.0 --> 3503.04
I can't just feel it coming

3500.28 --> 3506.1600000000003
I always have by the way

3503.04 --> 3508.38
but only when I take things serious if

3506.16 --> 3512.0989999999997
I'd be like halfway distracted yeah then

3508.38 --> 3516.839
I like get hit by a car in no time

3512.099 --> 3518.6400000000003
uh that's why I never do it

3516.839 --> 3520.68
without my attention

3518.64 --> 3522.299
so it's just be fanatical whatever you

3520.68 --> 3524.94
do like there's

3522.299 --> 3527.52
three flights of stairs

3524.94 --> 3530.78
did I have to go through to get in and

3527.52 --> 3530.78
out of my apartment

3531.54 --> 3536.94
well that's

3533.46 --> 3540.119
effectively like a sports

3536.94 --> 3542.16
thing right a lot of stairs I'm not

3540.119 --> 3544.5
gonna go back before but before I'm not

3542.16 --> 3547.3799999999997
gonna be like a [ __ ] sorry you're

3544.5 --> 3549.839
technically not a [ __ ] it's just that

3547.38 --> 3551.819
it always this is part of the reason why

3549.839 --> 3553.74
I never got into gyms because I always

3551.819 --> 3556.92
just personally thought it was sort of

3553.74 --> 3559.5789999999997
little [ __ ] but it isn't it it doesn't

3556.92 --> 3559.579
have to be

3560.7 --> 3567.98
but you are like at a higher

3563.94 --> 3571.02
gay adjacent risk though

3567.98 --> 3573.42
sorry never mind

3571.02 --> 3575.46
this is not about you by the way if I

3573.42 --> 3577.02
wrote don't worry I'm not gonna say

3575.46 --> 3578.339
that's gay

3577.02 --> 3580.98
ah

3578.339 --> 3585.02
oh and technically you stopped so I

3580.98 --> 3585.02
let's not let this get any worse

3585.9 --> 3592.559
but yeah I mean there's stairs so

3589.799 --> 3596.88
let's not go uh I have to walk all these

3592.559 --> 3599.52
stairs oh yeah but just like yeah good

3596.88 --> 3602.76
Rhythm good form can I like

3599.52 --> 3606.5
try it at a higher Pace let's see if I

3602.76 --> 3609.42
can like get a per like a perfect

3606.5 --> 3610.44
maneuvering system going around these

3609.42 --> 3613.02
stairs

3610.44 --> 3616.2000000000003
where it's just with basic hops I can

3613.02 --> 3618.18
like perfectly Place how I'm gonna go

3616.2 --> 3621.18
the track almost like I'm a racing car

3618.18 --> 3624.0589999999997
you know perfectly aiming where they're

3621.18 --> 3626.16
going but except not a racing car it's

3624.059 --> 3628.2000000000003
my body that's being

3626.16 --> 3630.96
propelled through this test it's like

3628.2 --> 3632.64
different ways of just doing a basic

3630.96 --> 3637.2200000000003
thing

3632.64 --> 3637.22
anything can be a challenge

3642.3 --> 3646.5
[Music]

3643.859 --> 3649.2
right so the biggest challenge for me in

3646.5 --> 3652.2
the stairs is how do I not go like oh my

3649.2 --> 3654.5989999999997
God I have to walk all these stairs

3652.2 --> 3656.72
so how do I turn it into something that

3654.599 --> 3662.599
I don't have to like

3656.72 --> 3662.5989999999997
be demotivated about that it's there no

3662.64 --> 3664.5
right

3663.28 --> 3667.3190000000004
[Music]

3664.5 --> 3669.48
so that's what I do with everything

3667.319 --> 3671.64
I mean I even sometimes use it to just

3669.48 --> 3673.38
trick myself when my when I find that my

3671.64 --> 3676.92
bike is kind of shitty and it is

3673.38 --> 3680.52
although I'm still happy that I have one

3676.92 --> 3682.619
but it's not great anymore

3680.52 --> 3686.579
because like the wheel is kind of weird

3682.619 --> 3690.96
it is wobbly and ugh

3686.579 --> 3692.099
it looks all rusty paint is chipping but

3690.96 --> 3694.2
I mean that's great that means it's

3692.099 --> 3697.319
never going to be stolen you see

3694.2 --> 3699.72
so that's always something I can find to

3697.319 --> 3702.24
win about everything

3699.72 --> 3703.799
but yeah when I find that oh man this

3702.24 --> 3706.2
thing is not going fluid I'm just

3703.799 --> 3709.579
thinking like oh so that means

3706.2 --> 3709.5789999999997
it's a harder workout

3715.619 --> 3719.28
and just at some point it's gonna be

3717.48 --> 3721.079
okay and a harder workout is very

3719.28 --> 3724.5
inconvenient I'm [ __ ] sick of this

3721.079 --> 3727.6800000000003
I'm now gonna fix this because I finally

3724.5 --> 3730.079
have like money opportunity to like

3727.68 --> 3733.02
do that

3730.079 --> 3734.7000000000003
but until I get to that point I'm just

3733.02 --> 3737.119
gonna be like no this is just extra

3734.7 --> 3737.1189999999997
workout

3737.22 --> 3740.22
foreign

3777.6 --> 3780.75
[Music]

3785.71 --> 3788.88
[Music]

3798.54 --> 3802.619
I've been looking for new big plant pots

3801.42 --> 3805.02
by the way but those things are

3802.619 --> 3807.2400000000002
expensive as hell

3805.02 --> 3808.2599999999998
damn are they expensive

3807.24 --> 3810.8999999999996
okay

3808.26 --> 3813.98
it's gonna cost me like at minimum like

3810.9 --> 3813.98
25 Euros

3821.299 --> 3827.7
anyway I found something

3825.0 --> 3830.96
I couldn't find that model which is kind

3827.7 --> 3830.96
of disappointing I don't know why

3835.03 --> 3838.2090000000003
[Music]

3853.74 --> 3856.8799999999997
God oh yeah

3856.92 --> 3860.839
so flat swords just fully back

3864.66 --> 3868.6189999999997
stored so all this video so that's

3867.18 --> 3871.0789999999997
pretty awesome and he had the stream

3868.619 --> 3873.839
yesterday and it was hilarious

3871.079 --> 3875.88
saw a big chunk of it

3873.839 --> 3878.46
couldn't sit through every freaking

3875.88 --> 3882.26
thing of it because he had Bev on and

3878.46 --> 3882.26
it's just oh my God

3882.9 --> 3888.0
ah

3885.54 --> 3890.7
I spent saying

3888.0 --> 3893.94
Earth is flat it's flat

3890.7 --> 3898.0989999999997
just say it Bev it's flat the Earth is

3893.94 --> 3900.2400000000002
flat I said it like probably 200 times

3898.099 --> 3904.6400000000003
it just

3900.24 --> 3908.7599999999998
spent so much time just not

3904.64 --> 3910.74
saying it it's so annoying

3908.76 --> 3911.88
so you would basically say yeah the

3910.74 --> 3914.3999999999996
Earth is

3911.88 --> 3916.7400000000002
well that is horizontal

3914.4 --> 3919.6800000000003
and horizontal is level

3916.74 --> 3920.7599999999998
Earth is level and like oh yeah so Earth

3919.68 --> 3925.44
is

3920.76 --> 3929.0400000000004
level levels horizontal well horizontal

3925.44 --> 3931.68
is also flat

3929.04 --> 3933.54
so yeah Earth is flat they just can't

3931.68 --> 3936.299
say it

3933.54 --> 3939.359
could he couldn't do it and I mean like

3936.299 --> 3940.799
that was like at least an hour

3939.359 --> 3943.2599999999998
of him

3940.799 --> 3945.799
not being able to admit that the Earth

3943.26 --> 3945.7990000000004
is flat

3948.06 --> 3951.219
[Music]

3954.72 --> 3960.359
I mean there's not much more to say

3957.9 --> 3964.26
because that is just it and then imagine

3960.359 --> 3967.14
one hour straight just non-stop

3964.26 --> 3969.9
oh the topography it's not flat yeah

3967.14 --> 3971.2799999999997
well Flat Earth is not a topographical

3969.9 --> 3974.7200000000003
claim

3971.28 --> 3974.7200000000003
it's a geometric plane

3975.359 --> 3983.7799999999997
and the geometry

3978.18 --> 3983.7799999999997
of the earth's surface is flat

3986.22 --> 3992.52
yeah the topography isn't flat

3989.16 --> 3995.0389999999998
except for the water mostly

3992.52 --> 3997.619
but yeah it's all it's all a matter of

3995.039 --> 3999.42
perspective you know topography when you

3997.619 --> 4001.6400000000003
zoom out

3999.42 --> 4003.619
then it all seems more flat the more you

4001.64 --> 4005.96
zoom out

4003.619 --> 4007.88
the more everything seems definitely

4005.96 --> 4010.2200000000003
flat on earth right

4007.88 --> 4014.059
if you have a topographical complete or

4010.22 --> 4016.339
cartesic Cartesian map

4014.059 --> 4017.7200000000003
and you like zoom out that it all fits

4016.339 --> 4020.42
on screen

4017.72 --> 4024.339
you take a look from the site yeah it

4020.42 --> 4024.339
looks pretty damn flat most of it

4024.559 --> 4029.8390000000004
if you zoom in well guess what oh Blue

4027.16 --> 4030.799
Hills and Valleys and yeah it's not so

4029.839 --> 4033.5589999999997
flat

4030.799 --> 4036.619
so a matter of perspective right

4033.559 --> 4038.7200000000003
you use a a microscope on the highest

4036.619 --> 4040.4
level and start looking at Material

4038.72 --> 4042.4399999999996
structures

4040.4 --> 4044.299
yeah that's not flat

4042.44 --> 4046.4
even though

4044.299 --> 4048.619
when you look with your regular eyes and

4046.4 --> 4051.079
you use the ruler yeah it was flat but

4048.619 --> 4054.6800000000003
then when you look you zoom in

4051.079 --> 4056.0
it's not flat it's not perfectly flat in

4054.68 --> 4058.0989999999997
that sense

4056.0 --> 4059.839
go get up close enough and nothing is

4058.099 --> 4063.6800000000003
flat

4059.839 --> 4066.819
but that's only topographical

4063.68 --> 4066.819
the structures

4066.859 --> 4073.339
on the surface are irregular because the

4070.76 --> 4075.079
topic is topography

4073.339 --> 4078.14
but the geometry of it all the

4075.079 --> 4080.6800000000003
orientation of the surface is definitely

4078.14 --> 4080.68
flat

4081.2 --> 4085.7599999999998
and that's the geometric Lane

4083.42 --> 4089.359
not a topographical claim and Beth is

4085.76 --> 4091.8190000000004
just refusing to understand that

4089.359 --> 4093.799
and I bet you have another four hour

4091.819 --> 4096.259
show

4093.799 --> 4098.179
talking about how we just don't

4096.259 --> 4101.679
understand

4098.179 --> 4101.679
even though we definitely do

4104.359 --> 4110.319
the razor Blaze Edge is not flat if you

4107.66 --> 4110.3189999999995
look close enough

4111.199 --> 4114.919999999999
yeah

4113.239 --> 4117.94
you get my point

4114.92 --> 4117.9400000000005
black Warrior

4139.0 --> 4145.66
went away came back over an hour later

4141.98 --> 4145.66
they were still saying yes I know

4145.759 --> 4153.04
and I was probably also still saying the

4148.819 --> 4153.04
same things in the chat wasn't I

4158.719 --> 4163.94
I mean I was just I I really was

4161.239 --> 4166.699
effectively just bullying Bev with the

4163.94 --> 4169.099999999999
truth it was just like

4166.699 --> 4172.12
now I'm gonna like counter condition

4169.1 --> 4172.120000000001
that [ __ ]

4176.5 --> 4181.16
I mean I really think of this one the

4179.179 --> 4184.219
only thing that's gonna fix Bev if

4181.16 --> 4185.48
anything is just Clockwork or MGM and

4184.219 --> 4189.4
just like

4185.48 --> 4193.2789999999995
it's flat it's flat it's flat it's flat

4189.4 --> 4195.799999999999
until he he just every time Earth is

4193.279 --> 4200.360000000001
mentioned he has to say it's flat

4195.8 --> 4200.360000000001
or he'll get like nightmares

4201.679 --> 4207.14
okay that's a little brutal I don't

4203.6 --> 4209.54
actually wish that on Bev but I mean

4207.14 --> 4212.06
it might fix it

4209.54 --> 4214.219
I think he probably got this [ __ ]

4212.06 --> 4216.92
through a process like that I don't know

4214.219 --> 4220.28
what the hell he's been through

4216.92 --> 4222.9400000000005
but his specific case the psychology of

4220.28 --> 4225.98
how what he does

4222.94 --> 4229.419999999999
seem very suspect that he's been through

4225.98 --> 4229.419999999999
some crazy conditioning

4231.5 --> 4236.6
really

4232.94 --> 4239.0599999999995
I'm not joking that's not like a joke or

4236.6 --> 4240.860000000001
I think I really think that Bev has gone

4239.06 --> 4243.64
through some weird conditioning at some

4240.86 --> 4243.639999999999
point in his life

4244.41 --> 4247.62
[Music]

4249.5 --> 4255.92
like maybe they put him in Ayahuasca and

4252.98 --> 4258.32
he was like haunted

4255.92 --> 4260.12
like maybe something like that I mean

4258.32 --> 4263.12
this is ridiculous for me doing this

4260.12 --> 4265.76
this is pure speculation okay

4263.12 --> 4268.28
but I I don't think Bev actually gives a

4265.76 --> 4270.62
[ __ ] though so I'm gonna do it anyway

4268.28 --> 4272.3
but let's just say that he figured out

4270.62 --> 4274.4
Flat Earth at some point and he was

4272.3 --> 4276.26
surrounded by people that were actually

4274.4 --> 4278.54
Jesuit

4276.26 --> 4280.64
I'm not talking about robe the people

4278.54 --> 4284.45
I'm just talking about a bunch of young

4280.64 --> 4285.7390000000005
kids that are basically everywhere

4284.45 --> 4288.98
[Music]

4285.739 --> 4291.259999999999
they're with you in class

4288.98 --> 4293.0599999999995
like they just they seem just like

4291.26 --> 4295.360000000001
regular kids but they like have this

4293.06 --> 4295.360000000001
mission

4295.4 --> 4300.82
and then he figured out that's flat and

4298.28 --> 4300.82
then basically

4300.98 --> 4306.379999999999
the kid it might have been very similar

4303.56 --> 4308.84
to what I experienced with my Jesuit guy

4306.38 --> 4311.36
it like gave him drugs and then during

4308.84 --> 4313.88
it like basically like

4311.36 --> 4316.699
completely taught psychologically

4313.88 --> 4318.62
tortured the Flat Earth out of him

4316.699 --> 4322.9
but he couldn't lose his love but then

4318.62 --> 4322.9
he became like allergic to the word flat

4325.88 --> 4330.62
because of it

4327.8 --> 4332.900000000001
and now like he still loves the whole

4330.62 --> 4336.199
thing but he's like

4332.9 --> 4338.239
like irreversibly compromised with like

4336.199 --> 4340.339999999999
this crazy conditioning that it's not

4338.239 --> 4342.5599999999995
that he can't call it flat

4340.34 --> 4346.659000000001
because then the nightmares come back I

4342.56 --> 4346.659000000001
mean it really does seem like that

4349.34 --> 4354.26
the way that he defends it is just

4351.56 --> 4357.14
unnatural

4354.26 --> 4360.14
the only place I've ever seen that

4357.14 --> 4363.58
to that extent is with

4360.14 --> 4363.58
anti-flat earthers

4363.8 --> 4368.96
and that's also because of Jesuit

4365.96 --> 4371.0
influence all of it

4368.96 --> 4372.86
I mean you you're not gonna find an

4371.0 --> 4377.6
anti-flat earther that has not like

4372.86 --> 4380.9
known a Jesuit or a Freemason

4377.6 --> 4383.659000000001
you're not gonna find them

4380.9 --> 4387.699
they all do

4383.659 --> 4387.699
those people are Gatekeepers

4387.86 --> 4396.5599999999995
they gate keep the anti-flat earthers

4392.3 --> 4399.56
some of them arguably are exactly that

4396.56 --> 4403.46
right just like the kid in class

4399.56 --> 4405.860000000001
is a Jesuit keeping track of people like

4403.46 --> 4408.08
seeing too much

4405.86 --> 4410.78
seeing through things too much

4408.08 --> 4413.12
and speaking out about it

4410.78 --> 4415.04
why if they're in class then why

4413.12 --> 4417.82
wouldn't they also be out there in

4415.04 --> 4417.82
communities online

4420.5 --> 4424.6
and they just seem like regular people

4424.64 --> 4429.9800000000005
am I talking about Bev

4427.699 --> 4433.04
what I'm saying is that I think that Bev

4429.98 --> 4435.389999999999
has probably been a Jesuit subject just

4433.04 --> 4436.5199999999995
like me

4435.39 --> 4440.360000000001
[Music]

4436.52 --> 4442.52
and he got completely [ __ ] up by it

4440.36 --> 4446.599999999999
I got [ __ ] everybody gets [ __ ] up

4442.52 --> 4450.4400000000005
about it but I am absolutely capable of

4446.6 --> 4454.3
saying the Earth is flat

4450.44 --> 4454.299999999999
you see that's the difference

4457.46 --> 4463.359
ah

4458.38 --> 4463.359
[Music]

4465.159 --> 4470.599999999999
maybe I was lucky together yeah I was

4468.26 --> 4473.4800000000005
lucky to get it I only had 80 years of

4470.6 --> 4475.76
terrible nightmares

4473.48 --> 4477.739
that when I don't realize what it was

4475.76 --> 4479.4800000000005
actually about and I remember it without

4477.739 --> 4481.699
realizing what it was actually about

4479.48 --> 4484.5199999999995
it's just like it like I've went to hell

4481.699 --> 4486.28
I mean I was definitely the lucky one

4484.52 --> 4491.8
yeah

4486.28 --> 4491.8
sorry I'm now I'm being just Snivy sorry

4492.5 --> 4500.26
I mean yeah letting the demons break you

4495.98 --> 4500.259999999999
definitely makes them stop torturing you

4520.4 --> 4525.099999999999
only eight years

4522.56 --> 4525.1
what

4525.679 --> 4529.2390000000005
now 80 years

4530.3 --> 4536.360000000001
but I mean it's it's technically I I

4534.44 --> 4538.4
call it years

4536.36 --> 4540.32
because yeah when you're in a Timeless

4538.4 --> 4541.639999999999
realm it's kind of hard to actually

4540.32 --> 4542.9
scale

4541.64 --> 4544.400000000001
things

4542.9 --> 4546.32
you know

4544.4 --> 4551.0199999999995
because like

4546.32 --> 4551.0199999999995
time is effectively like compacted

4551.54 --> 4557.3
it's really hard to even size up

4554.36 --> 4560.0599999999995
things and information and experiences

4557.3 --> 4563.2390000000005
by a time standard

4560.06 --> 4566.120000000001
the point is it it was so freaking much

4563.239 --> 4567.86
whether yeah even though in the physical

4566.12 --> 4569.96
world it apparently happened almost

4567.86 --> 4572.239
instantaneous like within

4569.96 --> 4575.9800000000005
a minute or something

4572.239 --> 4575.98
maybe longer I don't know

4577.52 --> 4581.360000000001
it was spread out anyways it's hard to

4579.86 --> 4583.159
tell it just happens in the middle of

4581.36 --> 4584.96
your sleep then how long do you know

4583.159 --> 4588.259999999999
that it's actually

4584.96 --> 4590.12
the ratio between the physical world

4588.26 --> 4593.3
when it's like how much time is taking

4590.12 --> 4595.4
in versus like the actual astral Dark

4593.3 --> 4597.56
World Experience how much time that

4595.4 --> 4598.759999999999
seems to take in it's so hard to size up

4597.56 --> 4600.7390000000005
guys

4598.76 --> 4604.780000000001
what I call it 80 years because it was

4600.739 --> 4604.78
just endless there was so much like

4605.12 --> 4611.42
from my perspective I was just like yeah

4607.46 --> 4613.88
I'm taking in like all all of it

4611.42 --> 4616.88
and while people dig through stuff there

4613.88 --> 4620.719
to find their own interests

4616.88 --> 4623.92
I was like no I'm studying the whole

4620.719 --> 4623.92
so I'm gonna like

4624.32 --> 4629.5
like oh no kung fu

4627.02 --> 4629.5
right

4629.54 --> 4636.739
I was like No just put the entire

4632.6 --> 4639.26
[ __ ] Matrix in there just all of it

4636.739 --> 4641.599999999999
and I'm not gonna like let it completely

4639.26 --> 4644.659000000001
reprogram it I'm gonna like

4641.6 --> 4646.58
dive through it

4644.659 --> 4648.3099999999995
through the patterns of it and like

4646.58 --> 4649.58
study the

4648.31 --> 4653.26
[Music]

4649.58 --> 4653.26
the experiences themselves

4653.36 --> 4657.648999999999
it's yeah

4654.6 --> 4657.649
[Music]

4666.98 --> 4670.759999999999
right

4668.07 --> 4673.58
[Music]

4670.76 --> 4676.46
but also the reason like why I say 80 is

4673.58 --> 4680.96
because at the end of it

4676.46 --> 4684.92
it just was so tiresome I just felt so

4680.96 --> 4686.6
old not like physically like oh I'm

4684.92 --> 4687.92
having trouble everything hurts or

4686.6 --> 4690.1990000000005
stiffer

4687.92 --> 4694.54
or like oh I can't think straight but

4690.199 --> 4694.54
just like I felt like so

4694.76 --> 4697.659000000001
worn out

4699.02 --> 4704.360000000001
from all of it

4701.6 --> 4706.34
that I just genuinely felt like this is

4704.36 --> 4708.32
what it must feel like when you're like

4706.34 --> 4710.3
super busy all your life and at the end

4708.32 --> 4713.32
of your life you're just like I I just

4710.3 --> 4713.320000000001
ready to die now

4713.42 --> 4718.28
it's been enough like that's the point

4715.88 --> 4720.679
it felt like that it felt like it's it's

4718.28 --> 4724.54
been enough it's been too much

4720.679 --> 4724.54
and that's why I say 80 years

4727.58 --> 4734.92
but technically time can't be actually

4730.76 --> 4734.92
Quantified on the other side

4739.58 --> 4744.32
it can only be

4741.679 --> 4746.78
felt it's like how much of a Time

4744.32 --> 4748.099999999999
experience does it seem to you to your

4746.78 --> 4750.44
consciousness

4748.1 --> 4753.5
like that's the only thing you have to

4750.44 --> 4754.9
go by because there's no actual like

4753.5 --> 4757.46
physical

4754.9 --> 4760.46
entropy that's causing a stable

4757.46 --> 4764.12
measurement of time passing that doesn't

4760.46 --> 4766.88
exist in the astral realm you see

4764.12 --> 4770.48
there's no reference for that at all

4766.88 --> 4772.26
everything goes by the rhythm of

4770.48 --> 4775.459
your perception

4772.26 --> 4775.459
[Music]

4779.659 --> 4783.199
everything you learn you get it at the

4782.42 --> 4787.4800000000005
pace

4783.199 --> 4787.48
that you can assimilate it

4805.04 --> 4809.96
one nightmare can mess you up

4807.26 --> 4812.3
yeah it wasn't like a regular nightmare

4809.96 --> 4813.679
though it's not like

4812.3 --> 4817.46
but you're not in control something

4813.679 --> 4818.96
[ __ ] up happens a monster

4817.46 --> 4822.44
violence

4818.96 --> 4826.76
it's not nightmares like that

4822.44 --> 4830.0199999999995
it's just like a lot of gruesome truths

4826.76 --> 4830.02
that you're being subjected to

4830.12 --> 4834.5599999999995
the closest you could probably compare

4832.28 --> 4837.199
it to but it isn't though so don't take

4834.56 --> 4839.2390000000005
that little is like watching a lot of

4837.199 --> 4841.759999999999
snuff movies except

4839.239 --> 4844.58
in this case it's like real situations

4841.76 --> 4848.0
not things that were recorded like it's

4844.58 --> 4851.98
not like mate like that thank God but it

4848.0 --> 4851.98
was just like a lot of [ __ ] up things

4852.08 --> 4856.36
just a lot a lot of [ __ ] up things

4858.5 --> 4864.34
some of which I don't even want to begin

4861.02 --> 4864.34
to describe

4871.76 --> 4877.280000000001
right but none of it

4874.58 --> 4879.08
induce the fear of me of like oh this

4877.28 --> 4881.12
thing that's happening in my experience

4879.08 --> 4882.32
now is gonna kill me no that fears

4881.12 --> 4885.199
wasn't there

4882.32 --> 4888.58
so it's still not really comparable to

4885.199 --> 4888.58
like an actual physical

4889.159 --> 4896.32
close call

4891.98 --> 4899.0599999999995
in depth and all that it's not like that

4896.32 --> 4900.86
going through all that it's not like a

4899.06 --> 4904.280000000001
consecutive set of experience where

4900.86 --> 4906.98
you're like literally like ah

4904.28 --> 4909.199
although there were parts of it where I

4906.98 --> 4911.5599999999995
was at because hey when I got innovate a

4909.199 --> 4911.5599999999995
lot of it

4912.14 --> 4917.12
I didn't know that it wasn't physically

4914.96 --> 4919.699
real

4917.12 --> 4921.739
so for a bit I did have that and that

4919.699 --> 4925.04
did seem like it was endless but then

4921.739 --> 4927.08
eventually I figured it out and then

4925.04 --> 4928.82
and then I could just like still it was

4927.08 --> 4930.62
still just horrible like it's just

4928.82 --> 4931.58
horrible that it existed but I could

4930.62 --> 4935.96
like

4931.58 --> 4939.199
separated and just like sort of study it

4935.96 --> 4941.659
but not too closely but still like try

4939.199 --> 4942.699
to find patterns that I could use to

4941.659 --> 4945.5
like

4942.699 --> 4948.739
recognize it

4945.5 --> 4951.86
and to derive like how the motivation

4948.739 --> 4955.12
systems internally work

4951.86 --> 4955.12
with what drives that

4956.659 --> 4962.599999999999
so that I would be able to predict

4959.36 --> 4964.839999999999
what evil people will do on an intuitive

4962.6 --> 4964.84
level

4965.239 --> 4971.9
especially the really smart ones that

4967.88 --> 4971.900000000001
operated a less

4972.5 --> 4977.42
straightforward way that are really

4974.6 --> 4978.9800000000005
complex Minds there are some really evil

4977.42 --> 4982.12
really complex Minds out there and

4978.98 --> 4982.12
they're just like cryptic

4986.06 --> 4988.4800000000005
anyway

4989.54 --> 4995.199
quit smoking and the dreams are pretty

4992.179 --> 4995.1990000000005
bad hmm

5005.92 --> 5011.159
give me the dreams that are mine anyway

5008.32 --> 5011.159
okay else

5017.38 --> 5019.56
foreign

5026.98 --> 5032.459999999999
well if I quit smoking my dreams will

5029.86 --> 5032.46
not be bad

5033.04 --> 5040.56
it's just that

5036.159 --> 5040.5599999999995
it's gonna be more strenuous on my mind

5049.0 --> 5054.699
you could almost say that

5051.46 --> 5056.5
the smoking of cannabis that I do I do

5054.699 --> 5061.0199999999995
I'm sorry I never do it on the show I

5056.5 --> 5061.02
never show you except for New Year's Eve

5061.78 --> 5067.0
I think sometimes that it like

5063.52 --> 5068.860000000001
effectively slows

5067.0 --> 5072.28
me down

5068.86 --> 5074.5599999999995
so that what actually happens inside of

5072.28 --> 5077.699
my head is like

5074.56 --> 5077.6990000000005
more tenable

5078.1 --> 5082.42
because if I don't smoke it seems like

5080.32 --> 5084.699
it all just goes so fast that I just

5082.42 --> 5086.92
can't get a grip on it

5084.699 --> 5088.9
and it was also a big issue when I was

5086.92 --> 5092.08
very young and that issue like

5088.9 --> 5094.839999999999
immediately stopped

5092.08 --> 5096.58
when I first smoked cannabis when I was

5094.84 --> 5098.9800000000005
15.

5096.58 --> 5101.32
like that suddenly I was able to

5098.98 --> 5103.178999999999
actually think out loud and be

5101.32 --> 5105.94
comprehensible and suddenly people

5103.179 --> 5107.56
realized how smart I was before that I

5105.94 --> 5109.299999999999
could just barely communicate I just

5107.56 --> 5110.9400000000005
seem more like a

5109.3 --> 5114.46
weird

5110.94 --> 5117.04
autistic complex guy that barely talked

5114.46 --> 5119.199
or if I start talking it would just seem

5117.04 --> 5121.06
like hyper esoteric and people wouldn't

5119.199 --> 5123.659
really understand because I wasn't that

5121.06 --> 5123.659000000001
good at it

5124.98 --> 5129.699
thank you

5127.42 --> 5131.38
but cannabis just changed that it made

5129.699 --> 5134.86
it

5131.38 --> 5138.34
made my internal perception go at a pace

5134.86 --> 5140.739
that it's just more explicable

5138.34 --> 5143.56
I can communicate better

5140.739 --> 5146.62
thanks to cannabis

5143.56 --> 5149.02
and it's just with smoking it I mean I

5146.62 --> 5151.48
don't even know what happens if you like

5149.02 --> 5154.780000000001
do careful supplementation with it

5151.48 --> 5158.58
instead I've never even tried that never

5154.78 --> 5158.58
really seemed to need to

5158.639 --> 5163.9800000000005
although it is in like the back of my

5160.84 --> 5163.9800000000005
mind that I could do that

5164.739 --> 5170.379999999999
but I mean it's not cheap but get just

5167.38 --> 5173.8
one bottle of that stuff it's gonna be

5170.38 --> 5175.0
like 40 to 80 Euros if not like hundreds

5173.8 --> 5178.42
of euros

5175.0 --> 5182.639
so not in the super hurry to like go

5178.42 --> 5182.639
there because it's so freaking expensive

5182.8 --> 5187.1
ah

5183.7 --> 5187.099999999999
[Music]

5190.6 --> 5196.6
right take off day smoking

5193.3 --> 5199.0
yeah right Rachel G

5196.6 --> 5201.52
but that's the funny thing it's like

5199.0 --> 5204.1
sometimes it's good to just not smoke a

5201.52 --> 5207.1
day or something maybe two days

5204.1 --> 5209.92
and then you like really clear up it's

5207.1 --> 5213.659000000001
like everything becomes super clear

5209.92 --> 5213.659
but that doesn't last though

5213.82 --> 5218.0199999999995
that only happens right after you quit

5216.159 --> 5220.719
for a bit

5218.02 --> 5222.96
and then eventually it just goes back to

5220.719 --> 5222.96
the

5224.08 --> 5228.82
the boring

5225.94 --> 5231.0599999999995
and not super clear

5228.82 --> 5231.0599999999995
foreign

5241.38 --> 5247.42
bad on me it was really smoking a lot

5244.9 --> 5249.759999999999
chasing eyes yes yeah if you're chasing

5247.42 --> 5251.08
highs you're just continually burdening

5249.76 --> 5254.88
your system

5251.08 --> 5254.88
you gotta space it out properly

5256.96 --> 5262.2390000000005
spending money in an apple oh yeah

5259.32 --> 5265.38
[Music]

5262.239 --> 5265.379999999999
tell me about it

5267.58 --> 5273.46
I know how much space

5269.56 --> 5275.860000000001
as much space as you can afford

5273.46 --> 5278.38
these weeks

5275.86 --> 5282.099999999999
it all depends

5278.38 --> 5284.1990000000005
what you got what it can do for you

5282.1 --> 5286.780000000001
you would just if you really want to

5284.199 --> 5287.98
master it then you gotta know like what

5286.78 --> 5290.44
it's like

5287.98 --> 5292.12
like is it still worth it if it's like

5290.44 --> 5294.4
once a week

5292.12 --> 5296.26
or does it just have too much impact

5294.4 --> 5298.9
then and too much of a drag behind it

5296.26 --> 5301.780000000001
when you have to then stop it

5298.9 --> 5303.638999999999
right you have to figure it out like how

5301.78 --> 5306.699
it works with you

5303.639 --> 5309.88
like for me is definitely I need to like

5306.699 --> 5312.759999999999
basically smoke every day but not too

5309.88 --> 5314.7390000000005
much every day

5312.76 --> 5317.5
and then sometimes

5314.739 --> 5319.78
small period where I swear stop just

5317.5 --> 5322.0
like clean myself up and where it really

5319.78 --> 5325.719
works like well

5322.0 --> 5327.219
but if I like it's so tight the budget

5325.719 --> 5329.44
they're like oh I have to spread it out

5327.219 --> 5332.02
and smoke like

5329.44 --> 5334.0
once a day and then two days not I would

5332.02 --> 5337.4800000000005
like not

5334.0 --> 5339.58
it would like all fall apart

5337.48 --> 5341.0199999999995
because as soon as I don't smoke every

5339.58 --> 5344.139
day anymore

5341.02 --> 5346.320000000001
mostly all weed becomes too strong for

5344.139 --> 5346.32
me

5348.699 --> 5355.299999999999
the impact becomes like too great

5352.36 --> 5358.179
if I space it out too much when I say

5355.3 --> 5361.12
space out I really mean space out within

5358.179 --> 5364.0
a day this is

5361.12 --> 5364.87
like don't chain smoke try not to chain

5364.0 --> 5369.699
smoke it

5364.87 --> 5372.58
[Music]

5369.699 --> 5375.28
right and if you're like very little

5372.58 --> 5377.08
that you can smoke then it's better to

5375.28 --> 5379.48
like just smoke

5377.08 --> 5382.3
jointer I I don't even know if yeah I

5379.48 --> 5385.0
guess it's a European thing right or you

5382.3 --> 5387.159000000001
can just roll a European joint and then

5385.0 --> 5389.199
have a lot of tobacco and just a bunch

5387.159 --> 5391.12
of crumbs of cannabis

5389.199 --> 5393.219
and it'll still have the taste it'll

5391.12 --> 5395.08
still have a bit of the feel like that's

5393.219 --> 5397.6
very doable for me and that way I can

5395.08 --> 5400.239
like space it out and then still be

5397.6 --> 5403.0
smoking it it's just not as much

5400.239 --> 5405.638999999999
and it's still fine because I am

5403.0 --> 5407.02
sensitive to it it won't have like a big

5405.639 --> 5409.2390000000005
impact

5407.02 --> 5411.34
but it will be there it will it will

5409.239 --> 5414.299999999999
prevent me from basically getting too

5411.34 --> 5414.3
sensitive for it again

5415.679 --> 5419.46
that's how I deal with it

5425.5 --> 5431.38
slowly got more and more [ __ ] yeah

5427.719 --> 5433.9800000000005
tell me about it moon buggy I mean yeah

5431.38 --> 5433.9800000000005
Martin Luther

5436.179 --> 5442.179
uh some of those other guys out there

5440.5 --> 5445.34
it's

5442.179 --> 5448.47
lower goes to [ __ ]

5445.34 --> 5448.47
[Music]

5460.12 --> 5465.159
oh it stops working three months ago so

5462.88 --> 5466.7300000000005
today oh cool good good for you just

5465.159 --> 5469.0599999999995
being

5466.73 --> 5471.82
[Music]

5469.06 --> 5474.88
I basically stopped drinking in January

5471.82 --> 5478.179
and I'm just really happy about that

5474.88 --> 5481.4400000000005
I feel so much better still smoking

5478.179 --> 5481.4400000000005
but not drinking anymore

5484.78 --> 5489.099999999999
and now

5486.1 --> 5491.34
I can be on the show without wearing a

5489.1 --> 5494.7390000000005
t-shirt

5491.34 --> 5499.4400000000005
and not feel embarrassed

5494.739 --> 5502.66
and like be able to show off my ribs

5499.44 --> 5502.66
[Music]

5510.699 --> 5517.839999999999
better but the damage is done

5514.0 --> 5520.0
and it will take a while to undo okay

5517.84 --> 5522.719
well my smoking doesn't really do that

5520.0 --> 5522.719
much damage

5522.88 --> 5528.82
I mean it has an influence but

5525.82 --> 5530.98
I'm very careful with how I smoke

5528.82 --> 5534.34
even with the tobacco

5530.98 --> 5536.62
I still insist every time always even

5534.34 --> 5538.56
with cigarettes like even if it's just

5536.62 --> 5541.54
tobacco I use

5538.56 --> 5543.9400000000005
ceramic filters

5541.54 --> 5546.159
there's carbon in there it's like this

5543.94 --> 5549.78
chalk

5546.159 --> 5552.04
caps paper coil and there's like

5549.78 --> 5554.44
granules of

5552.04 --> 5557.139
uh carbon

5554.44 --> 5559.48
small carbon granules in there

5557.139 --> 5562.12
this works great as a filter it is the

5559.48 --> 5564.5199999999995
best thing ever and then I even put like

5562.12 --> 5566.32
a paper tip

5564.52 --> 5568.719
right

5566.32 --> 5570.759999999999
put that right next to it

5568.719 --> 5573.04
with a separate piece of paper and then

5570.76 --> 5575.38
I have like a double filters both the

5573.04 --> 5577.239
paper filter and this one works really

5575.38 --> 5579.58
good for the suction too if you put a

5577.239 --> 5581.0199999999995
piece of paper before this filter if you

5579.58 --> 5583.0
put it directly on it's going to be

5581.02 --> 5586.2390000000005
different

5583.0 --> 5589.3
and that way well these things like

5586.239 --> 5592.48
filter out most of the tar

5589.3 --> 5595.2390000000005
which is a very important component to

5592.48 --> 5598.419999999999
what is a burden to your lungs because

5595.239 --> 5599.32
your lungs have to clean that up all the

5598.42 --> 5602.08
time

5599.32 --> 5604.719
and it's tough to remove

5602.08 --> 5607.84
and that's the problem

5604.719 --> 5609.46
the rest of the stuff yeah it might be

5607.84 --> 5611.92
garbage you might even have like a

5609.46 --> 5615.1
traces of formaldehyde and whatever like

5611.92 --> 5616.9
yeah burning of smoke and stuff it is

5615.1 --> 5619.900000000001
it's

5616.9 --> 5623.08
it has a lot of toxins in it too but

5619.9 --> 5626.44
your body can like it's not gonna get

5623.08 --> 5629.199
stuck on the long surface you see it

5626.44 --> 5631.0599999999995
will be processed by the lungs and liver

5629.199 --> 5634.12
and the kidneys and all that it will

5631.06 --> 5636.96
just be transported and removed and you

5634.12 --> 5636.96
will notice that

5637.179 --> 5640.7390000000005
like I definitely noticed

5640.78 --> 5647.86
the difference like when I smoked a lot

5644.02 --> 5650.56
like how I piss it's different

5647.86 --> 5652.0599999999995
chemicals you smell that there's other

5650.56 --> 5654.6990000000005
chemicals

5652.06 --> 5659.34
coming up

5654.699 --> 5659.339999999999
same goes for food too that's like weird

5662.56 --> 5668.860000000001
do you think of vaporizers no I don't

5665.679 --> 5671.38
think of vaporizer is a lot

5668.86 --> 5673.599999999999
I don't like

5671.38 --> 5676.54
pure cannabis

5673.6 --> 5680.400000000001
like even with vaporizers pure cannabis

5676.54 --> 5680.4
always like really make me stupid

5684.94 --> 5691.919999999999
it disables my grip

5688.96 --> 5691.92
for some reason

5692.02 --> 5699.639
like I get the stoner effect I do not

5695.92 --> 5702.28
like the stoner effect and that's why I

5699.639 --> 5705.34
don't smoke pure

5702.28 --> 5708.46
when I smoke with tobacco I do not have

5705.34 --> 5710.32
the stoner issue at all the worst I can

5708.46 --> 5712.2390000000005
get is that I have a moment of like

5710.32 --> 5715.84
well

5712.239 --> 5717.94
let's move on that's what I get

5715.84 --> 5721.62
when I smoke with tobacco if I smoke

5717.94 --> 5721.62
pure then it's going to be like

5724.38 --> 5729.4800000000005
and that stays like that I don't like

5727.239 --> 5729.48
that

5729.88 --> 5735.12
I don't like that it doesn't like feel

5732.4 --> 5735.12
good for me

5738.88 --> 5745.1990000000005
feels like when you do it like that that

5741.46 --> 5745.199
I'm just making myself dumb

5747.76 --> 5752.08
I don't have it that much

5749.98 --> 5754.178999999999
like when I smoke it with tobacco it's

5752.08 --> 5757.239
just

5754.179 --> 5759.58
it just makes things more tenable

5757.239 --> 5761.379999999999
my communication becomes better that's

5759.58 --> 5764.699
what it does

5761.38 --> 5764.6990000000005
the way I smoke it

5768.219 --> 5771.78
hey Adam eiken good to see you

5814.78 --> 5818.82
slo-mo

5815.92 --> 5818.82
yeah that stuff

5820.84 --> 5826.179
I'm so glad I'm not like a cigarette

5822.88 --> 5829.0
smoker so glad I don't like them by the

5826.179 --> 5830.8
way I think like all cigarettes are

5829.0 --> 5832.179
pretty much disgusting there's only a

5830.8 --> 5836.139
couple

5832.179 --> 5838.42
that somewhat appealed to me at times

5836.139 --> 5841.1990000000005
and there was cretek which is like an

5838.42 --> 5842.9800000000005
Indonesian thing

5841.199 --> 5846.04
and

5842.98 --> 5849.339999999999
story fissant mint cigarettes yeah yeah

5846.04 --> 5853.08
sorry for something

5849.34 --> 5853.08
like from the ad

5853.78 --> 5858.88
the Twin Tower ad that Quantum of Khan

5857.32 --> 5861.88
just played a lot

5858.88 --> 5863.4400000000005
yeah I I used to smoke those

5861.88 --> 5866.76
mint ones

5863.44 --> 5866.759999999999
I like that for a bit

5866.8 --> 5870.58
it didn't last but the crack Decker

5868.719 --> 5872.679
lasted very long and because it's just

5870.58 --> 5875.44
the taste was just so great regular

5872.679 --> 5877.659
cigarettes [ __ ] disgusting

5875.44 --> 5881.86
gretek loved it

5877.659 --> 5884.199
but I eventually even quit that and just

5881.86 --> 5887.62
like started making my own improvise

5884.199 --> 5890.099999999999
once so because it's not as expensive

5887.62 --> 5890.099999999999
that way

5890.199 --> 5894.699
and I do it really cheap

5892.36 --> 5898.239
it's like yeah I just take tobacco and

5894.699 --> 5900.94
then I just put organic Clover powder in

5898.239 --> 5903.94
it in a very little bit spread out and

5900.94 --> 5907.62
that's like almost like critic

5903.94 --> 5907.62
and it's so much cheaper

5911.46 --> 5914.55
[Music]

5918.159 --> 5924.96
hey seeking star water good to see you

5921.239 --> 5924.959999999999

5937.54 --> 5941.58
about pure cannabis yeah I have that too

pure cannabis can give you really damned

5944.28 --> 5949.9
coughing fits

5947.26 --> 5953.1990000000005
and I have like

5949.9 --> 5955.379999999999
coughing can do a lot of damage to one's

5953.199 --> 5955.379999999999
voice

5955.42 --> 5962.76
until you throw it in general

5958.54 --> 5962.76
and that can actually like yeah

5963.04 --> 5970.6
lead to more disease or yeah like flues

5967.96 --> 5972.34
and [ __ ] so I kind of learned how to not

5970.6 --> 5975.159000000001
cough

5972.34 --> 5977.56
even when I do have like

5975.159 --> 5979.96
and throw an issue like I don't cough I

5977.56 --> 5982.2390000000005
just don't cough I completely like

5979.96 --> 5985.0
mentally erased that

5982.239 --> 5987.459999999999
it's like that root that effect

5985.0 --> 5990.48
I've effectively rerouted it so that I

5987.46 --> 5993.04
don't need to cough I'll I'll like

5990.48 --> 5995.32
scrape things to the surface but I don't

5993.04 --> 5998.38
cough I don't do that and you you might

5995.32 --> 6001.139
have noticed that I had never coughed

5998.38 --> 6002.82
unless I like choke on my spittle or

6001.139 --> 6007.4400000000005
something or on a drink then I might

6002.82 --> 6009.599999999999
write that you can't really prevent that

6007.44 --> 6011.339999999999
but not because of something that was

6009.6 --> 6012.54
just generally hanging in there or

6011.34 --> 6018.3
whatever

6012.54 --> 6022.199
but when then you freaking smoke

6018.3 --> 6024.2390000000005
pure cannabis dude it's so [ __ ] and

6022.199 --> 6026.759999999999
and like every time I forget about it

6024.239 --> 6030.0
every time I try it's always like whoa

6026.76 --> 6031.62
and then you breathe it out in there

6030.0 --> 6035.719
I just hate it

6031.62 --> 6035.719
I don't like it I don't like it pure

6042.42 --> 6047.58
also

6044.1 --> 6050.88
I have at times smoked pure in the past

6047.58 --> 6053.699
and it just it can be so disgusting that

6050.88 --> 6056.34
like the smell of some cannabis when you

6053.699 --> 6058.259999999999
just burn it pure

6056.34 --> 6059.46
it's like yeah the first few talks is

6058.26 --> 6062.54
kind of nice

6059.46 --> 6066.26
but then afterward it can become so

6062.54 --> 6066.26
unbelievably disgusting

6067.139 --> 6072.84
and that never really happens when I

6069.96 --> 6075.42
roll a joint with can with tobaccos

6072.84 --> 6077.639
it never gets that gross

6075.42 --> 6080.9400000000005
only ever happens

6077.639 --> 6082.92
when you just use pure cannabis

6080.94 --> 6085.5
that's my experience

6082.92 --> 6087.3
and like when the taste goes wrong like

6085.5 --> 6090.06
that and you inhale it then like that

6087.3 --> 6093.659000000001
taste is in your [ __ ] mouth for hours

6090.06 --> 6096.84
you can't get it out it's so disgusting

6093.659 --> 6100.44
so no thanks not a big fan of pure

6096.84 --> 6100.4400000000005
cannabis smoking

6103.619 --> 6106.159
anyway

6112.139 --> 6118.1
greedy hits workout yes

6115.679 --> 6118.1
okay

6121.44 --> 6126.36
but the point yeah the problem is when

6123.54 --> 6129.239
you use a bong

6126.36 --> 6131.82
that just

6129.239 --> 6134.28
like you have to use your entire lung to

6131.82 --> 6137.5199999999995
just to replace displace all that smoke

6134.28 --> 6140.159
and get it in you it's like

6137.52 --> 6143.46
it's very different from when you smoke

6140.159 --> 6144.48
a cigarette because then it's just your

6143.46 --> 6146.94
mouth

6144.48 --> 6149.58
that's being

6146.94 --> 6152.58
that's creating the suction when you do

6149.58 --> 6154.44
a bone you have to use your lungs

6152.58 --> 6156.84
because you have to displace much more

6154.44 --> 6159.0
air and then

6156.84 --> 6162.42
it slips in

6159.0 --> 6166.44
and then you get the carving face that's

6162.42 --> 6168.54
why I don't like it pure and bongs

6166.44 --> 6170.46
and pure in a cigarette gets really

6168.54 --> 6172.44
[ __ ] disgusting too that's how my

6170.46 --> 6175.1
mother used to smoke it a lot and it's

6172.44 --> 6175.099999999999
really gross

6177.679 --> 6182.639
it's how I used to smoke it too for a

6180.36 --> 6185.159
while by the way

6182.639 --> 6187.88
but that was just so gross

6185.159 --> 6187.879999999999
I don't know

6188.46 --> 6192.4800000000005
ice water helps that's interesting just

6191.699 --> 6195.919999999999
being

6192.48 --> 6195.919999999999
that is really interesting

6204.719 --> 6207.38
okay

6212.639 --> 6217.52
this is really turned into a hippie

6214.619 --> 6217.5199999999995
Circle this is

6219.43 --> 6222.629
[Music]

6241.52 --> 6247.02
seeking star water just just be certain

6244.8 --> 6250.860000000001
just know that

6247.02 --> 6253.1990000000005
I diss on hippies hippy dippy right I

6250.86 --> 6256.94
diss on it but I'm testing on it because

6253.199 --> 6256.94
I'm actually a hippie

6261.78 --> 6265.159
that like yeah

6265.32 --> 6270.9
and I'm just trying to not be as much a

6267.84 --> 6273.06
hippie but we'll still retain all the

6270.9 --> 6275.339999999999
good sides of it

6273.06 --> 6278.34
it's just that I just know that hippies

6275.34 --> 6281.219
have there is issues that are naturally

6278.34 --> 6283.1990000000005
there because of that format of doing

6281.219 --> 6285.42
things

6283.199 --> 6287.4
and they annoy me and I wish that

6285.42 --> 6290.659
hippies could basically perfect

6287.4 --> 6290.659
themselves better

6291.239 --> 6295.699
be better at what they do how they do it

6295.98 --> 6301.5
and stay out of the claws of Hedonism

6299.699 --> 6305.48
because that's really always where

6301.5 --> 6305.48
hippies go bad through hedonism

6313.87 --> 6318.719
[Music]

6316.139 --> 6323.96
in far more complex than just no maybe

6318.719 --> 6323.96
yes seeking star water I know I know

6340.86 --> 6346.98
right so am I like I'm a little bit more

6344.1 --> 6351.38
complex than Justin

6346.98 --> 6351.379999999999
slightly aged heavy yeah

6363.06 --> 6370.52
looks like you got a fan in chat or you

6366.6 --> 6370.52
had a fan in chat so you saw what

6371.94 --> 6377.9
think of yourself as a complex hippie

6374.4 --> 6377.9
slow moment buggy

6380.04 --> 6382.5199999999995
right

6387.36 --> 6392.9
but like I mean hippies technically are

6390.0 --> 6392.9
just like a

6393.36 --> 6399.44
a bit of a convoluted like nature wizard

6396.9 --> 6399.44
right

6399.48 --> 6403.44
that's what a hippie really is it's just

6401.82 --> 6406.4
like

6403.44 --> 6406.4
power of nature

6423.239 --> 6426.239
hmm

6427.86 --> 6432.92
so yeah from the hippie stuff I've

6430.139 --> 6432.92
always liked

6433.199 --> 6437.219
spiritual things

6435.06 --> 6438.84
also that includes drugs that I was

6437.219 --> 6440.639
found that fascinating when I was much

6438.84 --> 6441.54
younger I haven't actually had done that

6440.639 --> 6443.159000000001
yet

6441.54 --> 6445.98
and

6443.159 --> 6448.08
and like herbalism like just this

6445.98 --> 6451.5599999999995
knowledge about

6448.08 --> 6453.96
how plants work and medicinal properties

6451.56 --> 6456.7390000000005
and my mother was into that too she was

6453.96 --> 6459.78
really into herbs and eating

6456.739 --> 6461.82
plant things and like she would be like

6459.78 --> 6463.8
you can eat this and I'm like yeah I

6461.82 --> 6467.299999999999
don't want it

6463.8 --> 6467.3
but yeah you could eat that

6467.38 --> 6470.579
[Music]

6470.88 --> 6475.56
but I've always find that amazing it's

6472.86 --> 6477.659
like it's one of the things about hippie

6475.56 --> 6479.52
culture that you find a lot of

6477.659 --> 6482.58
herbalists in there and that's like a

6479.52 --> 6485.040000000001
really valuable skill to have

6482.58 --> 6488.179
it's like invaluable when Society

6485.04 --> 6488.179
completely breaks down

6489.0 --> 6493.26
but even when Society doesn't completely

6491.639 --> 6497.34
break down it's still a variable

6493.26 --> 6499.9800000000005
valuable influential skill

6497.34 --> 6502.7390000000005
especially in age where like these the

6499.98 --> 6505.379999999999
the system met the medical system has

6502.739 --> 6507.959999999999
corrupted so terribly

6505.38 --> 6509.82
becomes essential for a survival now to

6507.96 --> 6512.46
have people around that have knowledge

6509.82 --> 6515.48
of plants

6512.46 --> 6515.4800000000005
medical knowledge

6533.28 --> 6537.84
I don't know hipster is more like a more

6535.26 --> 6539.88
recent thing though just being

6537.84 --> 6544.159000000001
I never even heard of the ward hipster

6539.88 --> 6544.159000000001
before the 2000s

6545.52 --> 6549.6
but maybe that's just me maybe it was

6547.619 --> 6553.28
there I just thought that hipster was

6549.6 --> 6553.280000000001
like more more recent thing

6560.94 --> 6567.619
or like since the 90s or something but

6563.52 --> 6567.619000000001
not like the 60s

6579.79 --> 6582.939
[Music]

6584.219 --> 6586.94
hmm

6589.679 --> 6595.08
the big Nicks turned into the headpiece

6592.32 --> 6597.32
yeah they did they kind of did didn't

6595.08 --> 6597.32
they

6617.28 --> 6620.599999999999
hello is that Pepe

6620.76 --> 6627.139
some rookola here I'm gonna Chow Down

6689.76 --> 6695.219

6692.4 --> 6697.4
even I've just don't know any books at

6695.219 --> 6697.4
all

6711.78 --> 6714.91
[Music]

6717.179 --> 6719.6
foreign

6750.54 --> 6754.68
[Music]

6760.92 --> 6764.82
wow you guys really are a bunch of

6762.9 --> 6768.259999999999
hippies aren't you

6764.82 --> 6768.259999999999
but that's cool man

6770.28 --> 6776.0
I think that my mom would probably like

6772.679 --> 6776.0
all of you really a lot

6777.09 --> 6780.229
[Music]

6786.07 --> 6789.21

6789.659 --> 6792.32
foreign

6805.16 --> 6808.51
[Music]

6820.76 --> 6823.9400000000005
could be

6832.56 --> 6837.179
if I remember correctly like

6835.139 --> 6840.86
she was part of like the bug one

6837.179 --> 6840.86
movement for a bit

6840.9 --> 6844.58
I don't know if anybody remembers that

6845.82 --> 6851.94
I barely remembered it would my mom have

6849.119 --> 6854.659
liked Nathan

6851.94 --> 6854.659
no

6858.15 --> 6863.46
[Music]

6860.699 --> 6865.0199999999995
Nathan would make her feel very

6863.46 --> 6868.679
uncomfortable

6865.02 --> 6870.179
my mom has probably would have continued

6868.679 --> 6874.26
to have

6870.179 --> 6877.9800000000005
like admission problems I can't admit

6874.26 --> 6880.4400000000005
things to herself was a big problem

6877.98 --> 6881.879999999999
and yeah somebody like Nathan like

6880.44 --> 6884.099999999999
really

6881.88 --> 6888.139
pushes buttons of people that have that

6884.1 --> 6888.139
so no my mom wouldn't have liked him

6888.42 --> 6891.96
I mean

6889.739 --> 6894.178999999999
unless you just never would have seen

6891.96 --> 6897.3
his shows or anything

6894.179 --> 6900.92
because hey in person Nathan is a really

6897.3 --> 6900.92
awesome polite man

6906.679 --> 6913.1990000000005
and very likable right but I mean yeah

6910.199 --> 6915.48
if you know him from his sessions where

6913.199 --> 6918.0599999999995
he's telling anti-flat Earth or double

6915.48 --> 6921.259999999999
speaking numpties to taste his balls and

6918.06 --> 6921.26
all that then yeah

6923.07 --> 6927.659
[Music]

6925.38 --> 6930.3
on the other hand yeah you might not

6927.659 --> 6935.42
expect this but my mother had like

6930.3 --> 6935.42
weird obsession with dirty words too so

6937.679 --> 6943.56
so yeah it's not even like she's like oh

6940.56 --> 6945.56
that's too below me she wasn't like that

6943.56 --> 6948.3
at all

6945.56 --> 6951.0
my mom was a bit of a potty mouth but

6948.3 --> 6952.08
not like oh cursing normally but just

6951.0 --> 6956.28
like

6952.08 --> 6959.0
she liked to say dirty words

6956.28 --> 6959.0
kind of weird

6981.48 --> 6986.78
I bet she wouldn't like do that but she

6983.52 --> 6986.780000000001
was fascinating with that

6987.659 --> 6990.9
she's not like continually embarrassing

6989.699 --> 6994.5
herself

6990.9 --> 6998.78
but she like thought that was like art

6994.5 --> 6998.78
and interesting it's just weird

7003.18 --> 7006.27
[Music]

7008.54 --> 7013.639
so who knows maybe my mother would have

7010.699 --> 7016.5199999999995
liked Nathan but there might yeah even

7013.639 --> 7018.5
if he did or she did then

7016.52 --> 7019.9400000000005
I think that would have eventually led

7018.5 --> 7023.9
to like a

7019.94 --> 7026.0
a competition still made of egos

7023.9 --> 7029.32
I think their egos would probably have

7026.0 --> 7029.32
clashed eventually

7033.199 --> 7040.219
but I mean I can't truly tell of course

7037.76 --> 7041.360000000001
but in my simulation that's something

7040.219 --> 7044.44
that

7041.36 --> 7044.44
feels probable

7048.32 --> 7055.04
cause my mom wasn't like she had a lot

7051.199 --> 7058.96
of domination tendencies

7055.04 --> 7058.96
like I

7061.52 --> 7065.4800000000005
she wouldn't present herself as

7063.86 --> 7068.799999999999
dominating

7065.48 --> 7068.799999999999
but in her mind

7069.86 --> 7075.739
it's like she had to have control she

7072.56 --> 7077.54
had to have the perspective of control

7075.739 --> 7079.879999999999
so she would basically impose

7077.54 --> 7081.199
imagination onto herself about how she

7079.88 --> 7083.42
was in control

7081.199 --> 7087.82
and funnily enough that did actually

7083.42 --> 7087.82
keep her stable and that did work

7088.219 --> 7092.659
but the reality of it is that she wasn't

7091.04 --> 7095.54
in control it's more like she was

7092.659 --> 7096.679
bluffing herself to be to stay in the

7095.54 --> 7099.08
saddle

7096.679 --> 7101.0
to keep confidence

7099.08 --> 7104.84
then that she was actually so she

7101.0 --> 7107.44
overplayed herself but that did

7104.84 --> 7107.4400000000005
work

7113.78 --> 7121.54
but she did thereby also to Outsiders

7117.619 --> 7121.54
sometimes seem a little overconfident

7121.76 --> 7126.08
and people would have like even like old

7123.98 --> 7128.0599999999995
colleagues

7126.08 --> 7130.58
way before he died would even tell me

7128.06 --> 7132.1990000000005
like yeah your mother like pushes

7130.58 --> 7137.08
herself too much

7132.199 --> 7137.08
and be like yeah I know but she's like

7137.9 --> 7144.08
we we can do nothing about it it's like

7140.42 --> 7146.3
she she won't even like discuss

7144.08 --> 7148.4
anything about it she just does this

7146.3 --> 7151.099
thing she decides to do that and like

7148.4 --> 7153.619
everybody just has to follow

7151.099 --> 7156.02
her decisions

7153.619 --> 7160.9
nobody can tell her anything about how

7156.02 --> 7160.900000000001
she like does the does her career

7162.02 --> 7165.159000000001
she was very proud of that

7176.54 --> 7180.739
although my mother especially when I was

7178.34 --> 7182.54
much younger did sometimes like ask me

7180.739 --> 7184.459999999999
like creative

7182.54 --> 7187.46
directions like

7184.46 --> 7190.36
what should I do now or what do you

7187.46 --> 7190.36
think about this

7192.44 --> 7197.36
but not about like how her job would be

7195.619 --> 7200.0
and like

7197.36 --> 7201.799999999999
that's just like she was just doing it

7200.0 --> 7205.36
and she wouldn't let anybody tell her

7201.8 --> 7205.360000000001
how to choose and pick

7205.52 --> 7210.280000000001
anyway

7207.08 --> 7210.28
it clarifies a little

7218.14 --> 7221.359
[Music]

7223.699 --> 7230.219999999999
oh my God I'm just melting here

7233.08 --> 7236.35
[Applause]

7240.92 --> 7247.219
has anyone else feel closer to someone

7243.92 --> 7249.679
after they are done yeah

7247.219 --> 7252.26
it's like all the Contemporary

7249.679 --> 7254.06
obstructions that were there to defend

7252.26 --> 7258.219
her psyche

7254.06 --> 7258.219
like those are no longer in the way

7262.159 --> 7266.36
you'll feel like the barriers between

7264.26 --> 7268.04
you are gone

7266.36 --> 7270.339999999999
that's what I thought when my mother

7268.04 --> 7270.34
died

7276.32 --> 7280.099
first I removed my shirt then I put on

7278.78 --> 7283.04
the metal again

7280.099 --> 7286.360000000001
no I never put my shirt on today I just

7283.04 --> 7286.36
put the metal on that's it

7287.96 --> 7292.4800000000005
The Medallion

7289.699 --> 7292.48
it's not a metal

7294.56 --> 7297.580000000001
I made it myself

7303.98 --> 7307.04
[Music]

7310.48 --> 7317.36
winter in Florida's Heavenly summer is

7313.699 --> 7319.96
Hell okay slow mo I didn't know that

7317.36 --> 7319.96
hmm

7324.81 --> 7328.02
[Music]

7330.44 --> 7335.54
what's the temperature well last time I

7333.08 --> 7338.8
checked here it was like 31 degrees but

7335.54 --> 7338.8
it's also very moist

7340.58 --> 7347.5599999999995
you know 32.

7343.52 --> 7347.56
with 46 humidity

7353.3 --> 7361.219
well at least it says Monday 27 and then

7357.92 --> 7364.76
Tuesday 22 with rain

7361.219 --> 7364.76
so woohoo

7365.42 --> 7370.6990000000005
kind of looking forward to that it's

7367.46 --> 7373.699
been a really really nice warm week

7370.699 --> 7375.919999999999
but yeah then you kind of long for a bit

7373.699 --> 7378.04
of a thunderstorm or something again you

7375.92 --> 7378.04
know

7380.96 --> 7384.92
I mean technically like who would ever

7383.06 --> 7387.34
complain about that setup for the summer

7384.92 --> 7387.34
right

7387.5 --> 7393.639
let's just say six days

7390.199 --> 7393.638999999999
like nice and hot

7395.719 --> 7399.92
and clear and all that and then a

7398.599 --> 7403.82
seventh day

7399.92 --> 7405.56
it gets cloudy big storm lightning lots

7403.82 --> 7408.799999999999
of water coming out of the air

7405.56 --> 7411.139
and then it clears up again the next day

7408.8 --> 7415.4800000000005
and then six days of nice weather I mean

7411.139 --> 7415.4800000000005
isn't that like a Fantastical setup

7415.699 --> 7418.9
isn't that ideal

7422.119 --> 7425.92
right maximum plant growth

7426.26 --> 7435.04
how do I remove my

7429.86 --> 7435.04
removing chest hair no Darren I'm an elf

7435.199 --> 7441.5
I'm not a bushy Brown indoor Indian

7442.719 --> 7448.34
no no I just don't have chest hair I'm

7446.36 --> 7450.5599999999995
an elf

7448.34 --> 7454.2390000000005
it's already a miracle that I can even

7450.56 --> 7454.2390000000005
grow a mustache okay

7456.94 --> 7461.199
I am there

7462.5 --> 7468.26
yeah

7464.06 --> 7471.76
and same goes for my back yeah I I'm not

7468.26 --> 7471.76
a hairy dude bro

7473.239 --> 7477.04
I think it's the Indonesian

7483.5 --> 7487.639
so you don't even grow a beard and

7485.54 --> 7490.28
therefore don't shave

7487.639 --> 7492.5
well I have to like keep track where it

7490.28 --> 7494.179
get or it'll get like weird patchy

7492.5 --> 7496.28
asymmetrical

7494.179 --> 7498.679
but no I can't really properly grow

7496.28 --> 7503.679
beard so I do have to keep shaving to

7498.679 --> 7503.679
kind of keep it nice and symmetrical and

7503.96 --> 7510.88
but no beyond my face I don't shave

7532.159 --> 7541.94
do you get beard around the chin a sick

7537.04 --> 7543.92
well barely I mean you I can get this to

7541.94 --> 7545.719
become a little fluffy like my brother

7543.92 --> 7548.06
has that too

7545.719 --> 7549.08
my brother also does not have a lot of

7548.06 --> 7550.46
hair

7549.08 --> 7553.34
like me

7550.46 --> 7554.9
so it is probably mostly for my from my

7553.34 --> 7558.56
mother's side that the hairlessness

7554.9 --> 7561.159
because my dad did actually he does have

7558.56 --> 7561.159000000001
a bit of hair

7561.32 --> 7565.54
chest hair and stuff I just don't

7570.26 --> 7577.76
but yeah I mean it's no way if it's not

7574.82 --> 7580.099
a proper thing like my mustache look

7577.76 --> 7582.56
yeah it's not super

7580.099 --> 7583.88
but at least it looks like a real

7582.56 --> 7585.679
mustache

7583.88 --> 7587.84
and that's good enough for me and I got

7585.679 --> 7591.28
my hair and this is great this is what I

7587.84 --> 7591.28
do this is how I like to look

7596.48 --> 7600.799999999999
and hate 10 years ago I never even

7599.78 --> 7605.08
thought

7600.8 --> 7605.08
that I would ever have a mustache

7615.8 --> 7622.6990000000005
the California Indonesian reason

7619.34 --> 7625.360000000001
could also be y

7622.699 --> 7625.36
yes

7628.34 --> 7634.179
the combination I mean my dad is not

7630.679 --> 7634.179
super hairy it's just a little

7634.639 --> 7639.679
but all his brothers are also not super

7636.739 --> 7641.9
hairy so the Indonesian definitely was

7639.679 --> 7643.6990000000005
not like of the super hairy type I don't

7641.9 --> 7645.98
think Indonesians are super hairy

7643.699 --> 7649.0599999999995
compared to others

7645.98 --> 7649.0599999999995
to more

7649.58 --> 7653.54
it's all Asians by the way they're all

7651.739 --> 7656.239
not super hairy

7653.54 --> 7659.36
some of them a bit but most of them are

7656.239 --> 7662.659
not really that hairy in like East Asian

7659.36 --> 7665.0
but you like when you get to India

7662.659 --> 7667.48
that's where things do start to get

7665.0 --> 7667.48
hairy

7674.179 --> 7679.0
which is my side my family is Elven

7680.719 --> 7685.9
well not sure my mother I guess

7700.099 --> 7703.3
I'm getting hungry

7715.34 --> 7722.3
Chinese Mongols never hairy Japanese

7718.88 --> 7726.679
Indian curry what

7722.3 --> 7729.76
oh wait the Mongols do Mongols do have

7726.679 --> 7729.76
hairiness right

7744.8 --> 7749.3
but it's especially most of the

7746.719 --> 7751.27
southeast Asians are not very hairy but

7749.3 --> 7754.469
in India there are plenty of Harry

7751.27 --> 7754.469
[Music]

7754.76 --> 7760.06
and then when you get to Pakistan and

7756.56 --> 7760.06
Iran it gets even hairier

7763.65 --> 7767.48
[Music]

7765.139 --> 7770.4400000000005
so they don't have like chest hair and

7767.48 --> 7770.44
stuff okay

7770.48 --> 7775.0

7869.659 --> 7872.44

8007.78 --> 8012.4
article thing and it's just

8010.0 --> 8014.8
I don't even know if I should talk about

8012.4 --> 8018.4
that [ __ ] it's so annoying

8014.8 --> 8020.7390000000005
it's Extinction Rebellion [ __ ]

8018.4 --> 8023.92
like apparently there was this protest

8020.739 --> 8026.44
somewhat like a few days ago

8023.92 --> 8028.0
and like the police was like water

8026.44 --> 8030.46
gunning them

8028.0 --> 8032.86
but dude it wasn't

8030.46 --> 8035.26
they were literally spraying them like

8032.86 --> 8037.179
it was just a hose

8035.26 --> 8039.579000000001
like the guys were just standing in

8037.179 --> 8043.4800000000005
those water and like yeah thanks for the

8039.579 --> 8044.619
refreshment because they they didn't use

8043.48 --> 8047.5599999999995
it

8044.619 --> 8049.48
like it was a protest the whole thing

8047.56 --> 8052.139
just looked more like it was like a gay

8049.48 --> 8052.138999999999
Street party

8052.179 --> 8058.9
like pretending to be a protest

8055.119 --> 8061.659
and now apparently a jester

8058.9 --> 8065.44
they're still complaining of that that

8061.659 --> 8068.759999999999
was like violence

8065.44 --> 8068.759999999999
like seriously

8072.28 --> 8078.759999999999
oh no

8075.099 --> 8082.179
how dare you try to stop us from

8078.76 --> 8085.780000000001
literally blocking traffic that's that

8082.179 --> 8086.9800000000005
does damage to the economy how dare the

8085.78 --> 8089.32
police

8086.98 --> 8092.32
pull them off the road you're a [ __ ]

8089.32 --> 8092.32
asses

8102.4 --> 8106.44
I mean this [ __ ] is a cult

8106.78 --> 8111.78
if anything the police should like make

8108.94 --> 8111.78
more hastes

8114.06 --> 8117.27
[Music]

8118.42 --> 8122.38
but I'm glad at least that they're still

8120.46 --> 8125.02
doing something about the extinction

8122.38 --> 8127.0
Rebellion crap because if it was up to

8125.02 --> 8129.76
those guys like our entire country would

8127.0 --> 8131.86
just be completely broken down

8129.76 --> 8134.079000000001
it really they do go that far they're

8131.86 --> 8136.0
like yeah shut it all down

8134.079 --> 8139.179
there's like these [ __ ] up stupid

8136.0 --> 8142.239
stickers everywhere like oh no more

8139.179 --> 8143.8
fossil fuels you don't know what the

8142.239 --> 8147.239
[ __ ] you're talking about

8143.8 --> 8147.2390000000005
you're a [ __ ] idiot

8147.579 --> 8152.88
stupid climate cultist needs to shut the

8150.52 --> 8152.88
[ __ ] up

8158.739 --> 8163.0
how long is it gonna take before like

8161.079 --> 8166.239
this entire thing is going to be

8163.0 --> 8169.36
classified as a narrative

8166.239 --> 8174.0
so there could be some

8169.36 --> 8174.0
some more actions to basically stop it

8175.9 --> 8180.0599999999995
they are like a Nazi cult

8185.679 --> 8190.3
right so if you in the Netherlands where

8188.44 --> 8192.099
you don't yeah where things work

8190.3 --> 8193.179
slightly differently as in the United

8192.099 --> 8196.84

8193.179 --> 8198.939
well if you can stop like Nazi Neo-Nazi

8196.84 --> 8201.16
March is [ __ ]

8198.939 --> 8203.62
well then you can [ __ ] damn well stop

8201.16 --> 8207.3
this stupid climate

8203.62 --> 8207.300000000001
Rebellion bullshiters

8209.08 --> 8215.74
who are more damaging because they

8211.96 --> 8217.719
actually are obstructing like normal

8215.74 --> 8219.699999999999
economics

8217.719 --> 8221.919999999998
like they're literally being a burden

8219.7 --> 8226.2
with their stupid protests

8221.92 --> 8229.719000000001
the Nazis are just like weirdos

8226.2 --> 8234.099
neo-nazis like yeah but at least they're

8229.719 --> 8236.509999999998
not gonna like try to ruin things right

8234.099 --> 8240.7
they could never get to that point

8236.51 --> 8242.679
[Music]

8240.7 --> 8243.399000000001
they'll all get arrested and all that

8242.679 --> 8246.28
[ __ ]

8243.399 --> 8249.34
right so why doesn't that happen with

8246.28 --> 8251.86
this climate Rebellion bullshitters

8249.34 --> 8255.909
I don't get it

8251.86 --> 8255.909000000001

over the place

8263.62 --> 8269.160000000002
Jared so I don't know I might just keep

8266.38 --> 8269.16
this one blank

8278.439 --> 8283.359
maybe I'll figure something out

8281.8 --> 8286.858999999999
right anyway I'm gonna take a two minute

8283.359 --> 8286.859
break so I'll be right back

8290.679 --> 8293.219000000001
foreign

8393.04 --> 8396.0
foreign

8422.92 --> 8427.62
oh nobody said anything

8425.5 --> 8427.62
um

8444.34 --> 8451.54
that took longer than two minutes oh

8447.04 --> 8454.380000000001
well I just say two minutes whatever

8451.54 --> 8454.380000000001
foreign

8460.12 --> 8466.5
yeah I've been going over two hours and

8462.58 --> 8466.5
19 minutes I'm getting really hungry

8474.64 --> 8477.539999999999
let's see

8481.3 --> 8486.599999999999
if I could make some kind of title out

8484.24 --> 8486.6
of this

8490.68 --> 8494.64
hair oh my God

8499.84 --> 8504.58
yeah I kind of want to avoid putting

8502.42 --> 8507.28
like cannabis or weed in the title if

8504.58 --> 8510.58
all possible

8507.28 --> 8513.18
a slight reference maybe but preferably

8510.58 --> 8513.18
indirect

8526.42 --> 8532.359
I mean the first part of the show I was

8528.88 --> 8534.519999999999
pretty esoteric and all that

8532.359 --> 8536.380000000001
but then eventually I just succumbed to

8534.52 --> 8538.6
the heat because I can keep being

8536.38 --> 8540.339999999998
esoteric but what will happen is every

8538.6 --> 8542.08
time I do that is sweating sweating

8540.34 --> 8543.819
sweating sweating and eventually it'll

8542.08 --> 8547.62
just be so distracting

8543.819 --> 8547.619999999999
that it disrupts the process

8548.62 --> 8554.28
being esoteric costs energy it literally

8551.56 --> 8554.279999999999
creates Heat

8568.06 --> 8572.699999999999
it's raining in Sri Lanka oh

8576.52 --> 8582.899000000001
India versus Pakistan match

8580.06 --> 8582.899
oh

8587.1 --> 8590.459
[Music]

8600.819 --> 8605.76
maybe I could call it like the bear

8602.62 --> 8605.76
chest challenge

8609.46 --> 8614.22
but I mean it's kind of silly to call it

8611.859 --> 8614.220000000001
that though

8683.02 --> 8687.829
foreign

8684.75 --> 8687.829
[Music]

8690.68 --> 8694.669
[Music]

8702.42 --> 8707.04
I guess I'm gonna call it this

8722.16 --> 8726.76
alrighty

8723.72 --> 8729.24
the hot after summer bear chest

8726.76 --> 8729.24
challenge

8732.04 --> 8738.18
makes it sound like it's really serious

8734.319 --> 8738.18
when yeah of course it isn't

8738.28 --> 8746.2
at least it's something right

8742.2 --> 8748.18
it will yeah I know my bear I am bare

8746.2 --> 8751.479000000001
chested here so

8748.18 --> 8754.42
thank you better than nothing I guess

8751.479 --> 8758.46
and it does like kind of Hit the weird

8754.42 --> 8758.460000000001
silliness tone of it too

8758.979 --> 8761.819
what do you think

8776.64 --> 8783.539999999999
ha

8778.68 --> 8783.54
good title all right I'll keep it

8789.28 --> 8793.78
who knows it's gonna hit off out there

8791.38 --> 8795.759999999998
that would be funny if sadly all these

8793.78 --> 8798.1
men are like

8795.76 --> 8800.02
gonna do it it's like yeah it's showing

8798.1 --> 8801.28
off how much they worked out during the

8800.02 --> 8803.640000000001
summer or something that would be kind

8801.28 --> 8807.460000000001
of funny if that actually happened now

8803.64 --> 8809.619999999999
we'll we'll see I'm just doing it for me

8807.46 --> 8812.5
and I'm just really happy

8809.62 --> 8814.300000000001
that I don't look like I have slight man

8812.5 --> 8816.88
boobs or anything anymore

8814.3 --> 8819.399
and like I can stretch myself like this

8816.88 --> 8822.0
and it actually you can see my ribs so

8819.399 --> 8822.0
thank God

8822.52 --> 8825.66
I'm not fat

8827.62 --> 8834.18
although yeah I don't know how I would

8829.96 --> 8834.179999999998
ever get fat with like that

8835.18 --> 8840.1
the tight diet that I've been having in

8837.76 --> 8842.819
the last half year at least

8840.1 --> 8842.819
and more

8845.56 --> 8850.3
September always like this in the

8847.6 --> 8854.399000000001
Netherlands no not a lot but we have had

8850.3 --> 8854.399
like nice and warm septembers

8854.439 --> 8859.42
so it's not the first September where it

8856.54 --> 8863.140000000001
is like almost another August

8859.42 --> 8865.92
zinc like was it two or three years ago

8863.14 --> 8865.92
2002

8866.439 --> 8872.26
yeah I think the summer of 2020 is like

8869.859 --> 8874.68
like even deep in September it was very

8872.26 --> 8874.68
warm

8875.14 --> 8880.358999999999
if I remember correctly I was at 21 I'm

8878.38 --> 8884.199999999999
not sure

8880.359 --> 8888.04
so yeah that does happen sometimes

8884.2 --> 8890.560000000001
it happens more in this last decade than

8888.04 --> 8892.720000000001
it did like in the 90s for example

8890.56 --> 8895.6
because usually then it was just like

8892.72 --> 8898.84
much colder and rainy

8895.6 --> 8901.359
a lot during September that's what I

8898.84 --> 8902.979
remember like having to go to school on

8901.359 --> 8905.819
my bicycle a lot that had always

8902.979 --> 8909.16
freaking rained

8905.819 --> 8911.019999999999
most of most septembers

8909.16 --> 8915.399
not every one of them sometimes it would

8911.02 --> 8917.08
just be like oh it's milder and it's dry

8915.399 --> 8919.56
and then the rain would really start in

8917.08 --> 8919.56
October

8932.5 --> 8939.0
they really Terry

8935.5 --> 8939.0
that's it though I mean

8940.5 --> 8944.76
hot is a lot hotter

8944.859 --> 8949.42
like when it's warm here that's like oh

8947.2 --> 8951.939
that's just that's our regular

8949.42 --> 8954.479
temperature that's normal to you that's

8951.939 --> 8954.479000000001
not hot

8959.38 --> 8963.22
but maybe there's like a synchronization

8961.479 --> 8966.58
process happening because of the

8963.22 --> 8969.699999999999
interface because of my attention to it

8966.58 --> 8972.6
that your attention copies it and then

8969.7 --> 8974.560000000001
the weather slightly manifests like that

8972.6 --> 8977.2
synchronizing

8974.56 --> 8980.74
sort of comparable to the lining up

8977.2 --> 8982.18
periods of of girls except it's weather

8980.74 --> 8983.74
mindset

8982.18 --> 8985.66
I don't know

8983.74 --> 8987.88
maybe that is a thing

8985.66 --> 8990.22
maybe if people like really closely

8987.88 --> 8993.099999999999
share information like that like

8990.22 --> 8995.679999999998
friendship that that does make like

8993.1 --> 8997.66
weather effects that they're going

8995.68 --> 9000.479000000001
through synchronize up

8997.66 --> 9003.68
maybe that is a thing

9000.479 --> 9003.679999999998
wouldn't that be interesting

9009.6 --> 9014.16
my description of whether my place is

9011.76 --> 9018.979
right right well that's maybe it's just

9014.16 --> 9018.979
a really uncanny coincidence there it

9019.08 --> 9027.3
or maybe there is like an astral

9021.42 --> 9030.02
connection between my city and India

9027.3 --> 9030.019999999999
who knows

9054.54 --> 9057.140000000001
foreign

9065.22 --> 9070.519999999999
and the Netherlands is very tiny

9067.56 --> 9070.519999999999
compared to it

9070.56 --> 9076.64
I mean India is like as big as

9073.68 --> 9076.64
all of Europe

9080.04 --> 9086.300000000001
for most of it

9082.5 --> 9086.3
most of Western Europe basically

9110.939 --> 9113.300000000001
right

9113.7 --> 9119.479000000001
anyhow I am gonna run out the show

9115.859 --> 9119.479000000001
because I'm really hungry and

9119.939 --> 9125.34
ground for two and a half hours

9123.12 --> 9128.220000000001
it's been fun

9125.34 --> 9130.859
but yeah I can't have like a four hour

9128.22 --> 9132.3
show every damn day especially when it's

9130.859 --> 9136.34
this hot

9132.3 --> 9136.34
so yeah tomorrow I will be

9136.5 --> 9141.96
having shorter shows

9139.14 --> 9144.779999999999
depending on how hot it is I might start

9141.96 --> 9148.14
late and then only have like a one hour

9144.78 --> 9150.18
show for like Monday Tuesday and then as

9148.14 --> 9152.46
soon as it cools off again I will just

9150.18 --> 9154.26
go back to one o'clock

9152.46 --> 9157.64
because

9154.26 --> 9157.64
it's doable then

9159.06 --> 9165.3
right yeah good yeah see you later Tarot
