3.12 --> 7.12
and i'm

4.319 --> 11.36
back yeah welcome to the second part of

7.12 --> 13.519
flat earth early bird number 692

11.36 --> 14.799
i'm your host irwin yeah my internet

13.519 --> 18.72
broke and had to

14.799 --> 21.119
completely restart my entire computer

18.72 --> 21.919999999999998
so i'm now starting the second part of

21.119 --> 24.16
the show

21.92 --> 24.160000000000004
uh

25.41 --> 28.71
[Music]

28.84 --> 36.239
see yeah hope people will catch on i did

32.64 --> 36.239000000000004
message in the chat

36.88 --> 40.800000000000004
because this is going to be a different

38.239 --> 45.038999999999994
chat now it's very inconvenient i hope

40.8 --> 59.28
people will catch on

45.039 --> 61.52
uh let's see

59.28 --> 61.52
what

63.32 --> 66.64
692 b

68.96 --> 75.19999999999999
wait is this still the same show no

72.0 --> 77.28
no no that can't be right no okay it

75.2 --> 79.36
doesn't show my previous show for some

77.28 --> 87.68
reason it just doesn't show it

79.36 --> 91.28
don't know why

87.68 --> 93.2
it's lame it's just

91.28 --> 96.56
it's just the internet connection

93.2 --> 96.56
cutting out at the modem

98.64 --> 104.0
and that's like out of reach of my room

100.56 --> 104.0
which is very annoying

109.68 --> 112.96000000000001
all right okay well michael jones i

111.36 --> 114.88
can't find it on my channel at the

112.96 --> 119.119
moment but whatever

114.88 --> 122.399
welcome back everyone michael jones

119.119 --> 126.64
stop traffic i'm arrested ahead rob h

122.399 --> 126.64
m ball over mccool

127.6 --> 131.679
good servant yeah welcome back

133.52 --> 138.72
right uh i don't remember what i was

135.92 --> 138.72
even talking about

140.4 --> 143.76000000000002
i was i was going through yeah yeah i

142.4 --> 146.72
was going through what i was

143.76 --> 148.56
doing yesterday the issue with flat

146.72 --> 150.16
earth debate right

148.56 --> 152.959
and still the end of the show was pretty

150.16 --> 154.64
good so we'll be hearing that back

152.959 --> 156.72
i'm curious to hear what got through

154.64 --> 158.95899999999997
during the entire discussion because i

156.72 --> 161.44
was very pissed off i was loud

158.959 --> 163.92000000000002
i don't know what got through but i

161.44 --> 166.07999999999998
tried to get it through

163.92 --> 167.2
that i did not appreciate being strong

166.08 --> 170.519
and being put have

167.2 --> 174.56
have words put in my mouth in context

170.519 --> 174.56
misunderstood anyway

176.4 --> 181.59900000000002
nathan's after show was good right

179.44 --> 182.84
oh you're a member right so you can

181.599 --> 185.51899999999998
watch it

182.84 --> 186.64000000000001
before the the rest of the public end

185.519 --> 189.68
right

186.64 --> 191.83999999999997
yeah yeah it was a good show i didn't

189.68 --> 199.84
watch it the first half but it was there

191.84 --> 199.84
in a second

203.28 --> 205.519
ah

208.4 --> 213.28
right yeah yeah arrest that yeah but as

211.36 --> 214.87900000000002
i said it was really just a force of

213.28 --> 217.68
habit i think

214.879 --> 218.64
you know he's he just has certain

217.68 --> 221.76000000000002
routines

218.64 --> 224.72
and hey people expect that too you know

221.76 --> 226.0
but he just kind of misjudged the

224.72 --> 229.599
situation and then

226.0 --> 231.68
bit down on it anyway but yeah as soon

229.599 --> 233.11999999999998
as you start to compare me to ed you've

231.68 --> 236.31900000000002
already gone too far

233.12 --> 241.519
it's like only trolls say that it's

236.319 --> 245.5
just yeah i i wouldn't call anyone

241.519 --> 247.20000000000002
among the the debate panel ads

245.5 --> 249.28
[Music]

247.2 --> 254.39999999999998
like unless they literally went

249.28 --> 256.639
clinically psychotic for some reason

254.4 --> 258.959
but yeah something like that hasn't

256.639 --> 258.959
happened

259.199 --> 271.52000000000004
he assumed right uh

268.8 --> 273.68
yeah but tiny wombo i know i know that

271.52 --> 276.71999999999997
but the thing is

273.68 --> 277.12
he's not making claims he doesn't make a

276.72 --> 280.639
claim

277.12 --> 284.08
his claim is is that the earth to him

280.639 --> 285.84000000000003
is naturally and observably flat visibly

284.08 --> 288.71999999999997
in a yeah

285.84 --> 288.71999999999997
how he says that

289.36 --> 293.36
so that's it

294.16 --> 299.759
so yeah of course you would like to do

297.199 --> 301.91900000000004
that to him wouldn't you get some

299.759 --> 303.44
payback here's the problem he doesn't do

301.919 --> 306.479
that

303.44 --> 307.12
and he knows it he has to keep reminding

306.479 --> 311.28
you because

307.12 --> 313.36
you're already in line to get your straw

311.28 --> 316.0
man's out

313.36 --> 316.47900000000004
and and start bashing him with it but

316.0 --> 318.479
yeah

316.479 --> 320.8
overlooking that he hasn't made any of

318.479 --> 324.71999999999997
those claims very specifically

320.8 --> 327.039
like i in my own way do

324.72 --> 327.84000000000003
from a certain presuppositional

327.039 --> 330.8
standpoint

327.84 --> 334.4
as in options i don't claim science

330.8 --> 334.40000000000003
though i claim cosmogeny

334.8 --> 340.32
but yeah

338.32 --> 342.96
nathan doesn't do that he is like a

340.32 --> 346.24
bottom line a baseline skeptic

342.96 --> 348.23999999999995
at it that's his attitude that's his

346.24 --> 350.40000000000003
vantage point and he doesn't want to

348.24 --> 351.36
evade from it he really does not like

350.4 --> 354.79999999999995
believing

351.36 --> 355.12
in anything he doesn't like it because

354.8 --> 358.0
of

355.12 --> 358.479
yeah because of his advantage that he

358.0 --> 360.479
has

358.479 --> 362.8
within his position right now in what he

360.479 --> 364.71999999999997
does he just doesn't want to do it i

362.8 --> 367.84000000000003
think he naturally doesn't really like

364.72 --> 367.84000000000003
dwelling on dreams as much

370.51 --> 376.15999999999997
[Music]

372.319 --> 378.56
so it's just not a very escapist type

376.16 --> 378.56
person

379.28 --> 383.44
because that is kind of what feeds into

381.199 --> 387.759
that into the dreaming

383.44 --> 391.44
and into the ball religion anyway

387.759 --> 394.40000000000003
and there are flat tests

391.44 --> 395.36
right well look you can derive geometry

394.4 --> 398.15999999999997
and you can

395.36 --> 400.08000000000004
figure out all kinds of things it's just

398.16 --> 403.28000000000003
not scientific

400.08 --> 403.28
it's geometry

403.36 --> 411.28000000000003
that's it

408.8 --> 413.52000000000004
like you're not proving the cause of it

411.28 --> 416.71999999999997
you're just establishing what is

413.52 --> 421.44
that's it well establishing what is

416.72 --> 423.81
is not science it's just sizing up

421.44 --> 426.939
basically

423.81 --> 426.939
[Music]

440.479 --> 445.81899999999996
there is no cause of flat

442.79 --> 445.819
[Music]

446.24 --> 452.16
well there is no continual cause of flat

451.36 --> 454.56
look

452.16 --> 455.59900000000005
the thing is if there is a literal cause

454.56 --> 457.199
of the flat

455.599 --> 458.88
yeah this is already getting into the

457.199 --> 460.72
scientific territory because

458.88 --> 462.24
yeah we're talking about shapes now and

460.72 --> 464.8
it automatically

462.24 --> 466.479
doesn't apply but if you would go with a

464.8 --> 469.84000000000003
causal relationship

466.479 --> 472.4
like train a thought then

469.84 --> 474.4
well if you want to get the cause of the

472.4 --> 476.08
flat you'd have to very manipulate it

474.4 --> 478.479
that would mean that there would be

476.08 --> 480.4
something that would be keeping the

478.479 --> 484.24
earth's surface in a flat

480.4 --> 487.75899999999996
orientation and that it would be

484.24 --> 490.96000000000004
flexible for some reason to be

487.759 --> 493.36
not be shaped in flat and then you might

490.96 --> 495.75899999999996
be able to figure out if that varies and

493.36 --> 498.16
manipulates

495.759 --> 499.12
what is the cause of flat why is the

498.16 --> 501.52000000000004
earth flat

499.12 --> 502.96
right now right but this is already kind

501.52 --> 505.52
of ludicrous

502.96 --> 506.15999999999997
but yeah that's that's the consequence

505.52 --> 509.12
of

506.16 --> 512.879
science and the fun foundation of

509.12 --> 512.879
science is the cause of an effect

513.44 --> 517.2790000000001
that's what it's about so something has

516.08 --> 521.6800000000001
to happen

517.279 --> 526.0
or has to be influencing something to be

521.68 --> 529.279
in a way that sort of thing

526.0 --> 532.399
it's not just hey what is it it's

529.279 --> 533.12
this it's that it's shaped like this

532.399 --> 538.08
it's

533.12 --> 538.08
that's not science it's just sizing up

539.279 --> 549.8389999999999
and yeah cosmogeny falls under sizing up

560.839 --> 563.839
is

566.32 --> 571.519
no that timeout was yeah

569.68 --> 573.4399999999999
you're not supposed to time people out

571.519 --> 576.64
rest ahead for the record but

573.44 --> 580.399
yeah cavendish is not

576.64 --> 580.399
science it's absolutely ridiculous

581.519 --> 585.68
it's not science in so many ways it's

584.56 --> 588.0799999999999
not even

585.68 --> 589.76
it's not establishing anything it's just

588.08 --> 592.88
a deduction

589.76 --> 594.8
idea trick it's a trick of the mind it

592.88 --> 598.08
does about as much

594.8 --> 602.0799999999999
as the focal pendulum does anything

598.08 --> 602.08
just doesn't do anything it's all a mind

602.839 --> 605.839
experiment

627.84 --> 633.839
[Music]

630.839 --> 633.839
uh

634.32 --> 639.519
i rest ahead yeah be careful the temper

637.519 --> 643.279
or people might start accusing you of

639.519 --> 643.279
having eaten soy recently

644.839 --> 647.839
huh

658.399 --> 663.839
no but seriously just leave leave

661.36 --> 667.6800000000001
[ __ ] ball comments in the chat

663.839 --> 671.6800000000001
that's not this that's not what this

667.68 --> 674.959
channel is about see because

671.68 --> 677.76
[ __ ] baller comments are like prizes

674.959 --> 680.079
to me it's something i can respond to

677.76 --> 682.0
and if you remove that

680.079 --> 683.92
then people don't see it just because

682.0 --> 686.56
something is really stupid doesn't mean

683.92 --> 691.279
that you can remove it

686.56 --> 691.279
it's just that if it gets really nasty

693.2 --> 696.24
that's when you remove it that's in the

695.68 --> 703.8389999999999
rules

696.24 --> 703.839
rasta anyway

704.56 --> 707.6099999999999
[Music]

709.44 --> 717.839
tiny wumbo you must be [ __ ] by like

714.839 --> 717.839
what

724.639 --> 728.8
that declaration of cavendish was a

727.12 --> 731.839
one-time exception

728.8 --> 731.8389999999999
that had to be done

740.399 --> 744.16
i know it just sounded like dumb surface

743.36 --> 747.519
level

744.16 --> 748.88
virtue signaling really what he did

747.519 --> 750.72
i don't know your rules while they're in

748.88 --> 753.12
the they're in the description

750.72 --> 759.839
they have been for over a year exactly

753.12 --> 759.839
this the live chat rules

767.519 --> 770.32
but that's okay

771.04 --> 775.92
martin tolberg what are you doing

774.76 --> 778.959
[Music]

775.92 --> 782.4799999999999
don't poke the rasta hat

778.959 --> 782.4799999999999
you're an idiot if you do that

783.12 --> 801.839
trust me on this don't poke the rasta

809.68 --> 812.87
[Music]

813.44 --> 818.24
get off the white horse he's never

816.16 --> 820.7199999999999
getting off that white horse rasta hat

818.24 --> 822.72
trust me i've been trying to address him

820.72 --> 825.36
on it

822.72 --> 826.399
he's never getting off that white horse

825.36 --> 829.6800000000001
it's

826.399 --> 834.88
basically yeah back of the horse is

829.68 --> 834.88
soon into his skin pretty much

840.839 --> 843.839
so

845.92 --> 850.88
no thank you michael jones yeah i i

848.24 --> 852.48
don't regularly share that there are the

850.88 --> 854.16
chat rules

852.48 --> 856.0
it's it's kind of been established a

854.16 --> 857.76
while ago when i was still

856.0 --> 860.079
trying to figure out what to do with the

857.76 --> 860.079
chat

862.399 --> 866.88
and yeah i tried all kinds of things and

864.959 --> 868.079
this is eventually what came out because

866.88 --> 870.88
before i would

868.079 --> 871.279
like literally just ban ballers if they

870.88 --> 873.68
say

871.279 --> 877.279
something baller stupid but it was

873.68 --> 877.279
really at the time because

878.399 --> 885.44
it still felt to me in a way like

882.399 --> 887.6
i was being outnumbered now

885.44 --> 889.44
technically the situation might not have

887.6 --> 891.1990000000001
changed that much

889.44 --> 892.8000000000001
people-wise and the amounts of people

891.199 --> 896.16
that believe

892.8 --> 897.76
in the ball versus not but

896.16 --> 899.68
like the energies have changed the

897.76 --> 900.56
amount of information has changed the

899.68 --> 903.5999999999999
attitudes have

900.56 --> 906.4799999999999
changed and i just don't feel

903.6 --> 907.519
intimidated intimidated anymore by

906.48 --> 910.72
baller

907.519 --> 912.9590000000001
assertions because they just seem like a

910.72 --> 913.76
religious assertions they feel like that

912.959 --> 916.56
they're just not

913.76 --> 917.76
threatening anymore they've it's like

916.56 --> 921.279
they've been dispelled

917.76 --> 922.56
to me they're not like oh this is scary

921.279 --> 925.8389999999999
i have to defend again

922.56 --> 929.1199999999999
against this they're not like that to me

925.839 --> 931.9200000000001
anymore now and that's

929.12 --> 934.24
also why i basically just allow those

931.92 --> 937.04
remarks to be made in my chat

934.24 --> 938.9590000000001
and then i respond to them and then i

937.04 --> 942.0
got something to talk about

938.959 --> 944.0
i can have a sort of a nathan rant but

942.0 --> 947.199
not as brutal of course

944.0 --> 947.199
i do it in my own way

947.279 --> 952.88
and yeah i think that people have

950.56 --> 954.6389999999999
actually learned from those rants

952.88 --> 958.56
it's also for me a good reason to

954.639 --> 958.5600000000001
basically tap into psychology again

961.12 --> 964.32
anyway it's all right you didn't know

963.6 --> 969.21
the rules

964.32 --> 972.499
they're in the chat it's all right

969.21 --> 972.499
[Music]

977.04 --> 983.8389999999999
vegan bear you don't sit and eat soy all

981.279 --> 983.8389999999999
day long

987.759 --> 992.24
i don't know if people can even do that

990.0 --> 996.32
you know soy

992.24 --> 998.48
it has protein but it doesn't it's just

996.32 --> 999.0400000000001
a protein mostly there's not really a

998.48 --> 1001.44
lot

999.04 --> 1001.4399999999999
in there

1003.04 --> 1006.399
except for the protein the soy alone is

1006.0 --> 1011.68
just

1006.399 --> 1014.32
not good food i think

1011.68 --> 1016.399
even if you if you were careful with not

1014.32 --> 1021.6
getting the estrogen

1016.399 --> 1021.6
mimicker thing in there anyway

1023.279 --> 1027.439
i know i've never been a great fan of

1025.36 --> 1029.9189999999999
soy but

1027.439 --> 1029.919
whatever

1030.359 --> 1033.509
[Music]

1036.4 --> 1043.679
beer is also an estrogen source

1040.48 --> 1048.64
uh it does they do

1043.679 --> 1048.64
say that it is that it turns uh

1049.919 --> 1056.4
some of the what is that

1053.84 --> 1057.84
some of the testosterone into estrogen

1056.4 --> 1060.64
or something like that

1057.84 --> 1060.6399999999999
i've heard that

1060.88 --> 1064.88
but i don't know i've been drinking beer

1064.4 --> 1067.8400000000001
for

1064.88 --> 1069.1200000000001
for yeah on a daily basis not too much

1067.84 --> 1071.6
though

1069.12 --> 1074.32
for a pretty long time now at least two

1071.6 --> 1077.12
years might be more

1074.32 --> 1077.12
and i don't know

1078.0 --> 1081.84
i don't really notice it that much

1082.0 --> 1086.48
but maybe that's because i drink a good

1084.96 --> 1088.559
organic type of beer

1086.48 --> 1090.4
and i don't drink too much and i do

1088.559 --> 1092.48
still eat

1090.4 --> 1093.44
healthy aside that and have plenty of

1092.48 --> 1095.84
supplements so

1093.44 --> 1095.8400000000001
i don't know

1100.88 --> 1106.16
that would explain why a lot of drunk

1103.28 --> 1106.16
men act like

1106.84 --> 1109.84
tits

1109.919 --> 1114.64
that's a good one tiny one more thanks

1117.28 --> 1120.6399999999999
but no i don't think so i think that the

1119.44 --> 1124.48
estrogen effect

1120.64 --> 1127.8400000000001
actually sets in afterward i think that

1124.48 --> 1128.4
it is look being drunk most of being

1127.84 --> 1131.6
drunk

1128.4 --> 1133.44
is really like the temporary state your

1131.6 --> 1135.6
mind has to deal with as

1133.44 --> 1137.1200000000001
your liver and everything is breaking

1135.6 --> 1138.7199999999998
down the alcohol and the other

1137.12 --> 1141.1999999999998
substances because it's

1138.72 --> 1142.72
alcohol is the most predominant effect

1141.2 --> 1146.0
influence of course

1142.72 --> 1148.0
but there's a lot of other stuff too in

1146.0 --> 1152.16
every drink especially beer

1148.0 --> 1154.0
and then during that processing

1152.16 --> 1156.16
yeah during that processing there's

1154.0 --> 1158.16
chemical reactions going on substances

1156.16 --> 1160.96
are being transformed

1158.16 --> 1162.559
to stick to stuff and all that and to be

1160.96 --> 1165.679
able to

1162.559 --> 1166.6399999999999
make it harmless for the body or or even

1165.679 --> 1170.4
utilize it

1166.64 --> 1172.16
to make it absorbable and yeah useful

1170.4 --> 1174.24
because not everything in beer is

1172.16 --> 1176.64
completely useless it's not just pure

1174.24 --> 1176.64
poison

1177.12 --> 1183.28
uh and i bet that during that process

1180.96 --> 1184.16
that's where the testosterone might be

1183.28 --> 1186.72
transformed

1184.16 --> 1187.6000000000001
and all that so you'll notice it the

1186.72 --> 1191.52
most

1187.6 --> 1192.08
the next day that makes natural sense to

1191.52 --> 1194.72
me

1192.08 --> 1196.72
oh hey hello geo-shifter by the way

1194.72 --> 1198.4
awesome video man i loved it

1196.72 --> 1200.08
well you know it i made two comments

1198.4 --> 1202.159
i've been watching that freaking thing

1200.08 --> 1204.0
for like 20 times now it's driving me

1202.159 --> 1207.1200000000001
nuts

1204.0 --> 1210.0
and you made the timing so great

1207.12 --> 1211.6
when the music first starts up when they

1210.0 --> 1215.44
basically say

1211.6 --> 1217.12
yeah the orbit of the wreckage

1215.44 --> 1218.48
is spreading out and it's becoming

1217.12 --> 1221.4399999999998
really dangerous

1218.48 --> 1224.32
because of the space-time bending

1221.44 --> 1226.72
flattening of the earth

1224.32 --> 1229.869
oh that was so awesome

1226.72 --> 1229.869
[Music]

1230.64 --> 1235.039
because they do say these sort of things

1233.039 --> 1238.1589999999999
it's just hidden in plain sight

1235.039 --> 1242.8799999999999
they they basically say flat earth

1238.159 --> 1246.5590000000002
just hidden in there it's beautiful

1242.88 --> 1246.5590000000002
you really picked up on that that was

1246.84 --> 1252.32
awesome

1249.679 --> 1252.72
oh yeah yeah gsjifter it's during when

1252.32 --> 1255.84
you

1252.72 --> 1255.84
are at work oh well

1260.4 --> 1266.48
i i hope it's still worth just watching

1263.84 --> 1270.1589999999999
just watching the show even if yeah if

1266.48 --> 1270.159
you can't interact with me in chat

1270.559 --> 1277.84
i do watch my own shows back and i think

1273.039 --> 1277.84
it's still quite amusing at times

1280.799 --> 1284.4
not all protein sources are equal the

1283.2 --> 1286.4
vegan myth

1284.4 --> 1288.8400000000001
right stopping trafficking arrest that's

1286.4 --> 1293.44
that's correct and it's

1288.84 --> 1296.559
also not just protein

1293.44 --> 1298.48
you know it's an oversimplification what

1296.559 --> 1301.44
they did

1298.48 --> 1302.4
just saying we you need this this this

1301.44 --> 1306.159
and this

1302.4 --> 1310.3600000000001
and that's it well what about all the

1306.159 --> 1312.5590000000002
millions of subdivisions and

1310.36 --> 1314.24
micronutrients and all that yeah yeah

1312.559 --> 1319.84
they don't mention that in the standard

1314.24 --> 1319.84
food pyramid

1320.559 --> 1324.72
so yeah if you're going to oversimplify

1322.48 --> 1327.6
things to oh you need protein

1324.72 --> 1329.52
well soy has protein so you take soy and

1327.6 --> 1332.559
then you have your protein

1329.52 --> 1336.24
well that's not going to cut it

1332.559 --> 1340.0
because there is much more than you need

1336.24 --> 1341.44
than just a singular protein-rich source

1340.0 --> 1343.039
there's all kinds of other things you

1341.44 --> 1347.6000000000001
need on top of that and

1343.039 --> 1349.28
alongside that anyway

1347.6 --> 1350.7199999999998
i'm gonna round out the show so thanks

1349.28 --> 1352.6399999999999
everyone for coming

1350.72 --> 1355.6000000000001
yeah this show was split in two so this

1352.64 --> 1355.6000000000001
is the second half

1356.08 --> 1360.0
because my internet yeah i got cut out

1358.24 --> 1362.72
