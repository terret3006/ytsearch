118.5 --> 124.74
anyway

120.479 --> 128.84
whether today is well it's not snowing

124.74 --> 128.84
but it's kind of like just the

129.599 --> 132.92
gray soup up there

134.34 --> 140.04
and it seems slightly Misty but it's

138.06 --> 144.0
just so little

140.04 --> 145.92
it's just yeah it's kind of cold

144.0 --> 148.099
feels like there's a lot of moist in the

145.92 --> 148.099
air

149.58 --> 154.34
so yeah

151.44 --> 154.34
I don't know

156.84 --> 160.58
it's like a mild Winter's day

161.94 --> 166.26
anyway

163.2 --> 168.23899999999998
hello Terry 306 first in chat good to

166.26 --> 173.819
see you

168.239 --> 173.81900000000002
it is Wednesday the 8th of March 2023

175.44 --> 180.319
yeah

177.98 --> 184.94
I feel pretty good

180.319 --> 188.879
managed to actually go to bed early and

184.94 --> 192.659
did what my healer told me to do and

188.879 --> 195.599
seems like that worked really well

192.659 --> 198.239
although that was so weird like because

195.599 --> 200.33999999999997
it felt like embarrassing

198.239 --> 201.84
but yeah

200.34 --> 204.239
it's like

201.84 --> 206.70000000000002
I've been thinking a lot about my

204.239 --> 208.739
internal workings oh what else is new

206.7 --> 211.01899999999998
are we thinking about his internal

208.739 --> 212.81900000000002
workings wow that never happens yeah

211.019 --> 214.86
yeah it happens literally all the time

212.819 --> 216.06
it's actually trouble letting that go

214.86 --> 218.22000000000003
sometimes

216.06 --> 221.879
hahaha

218.22 --> 224.159
but yeah it is productive

221.879 --> 226.819
because I'm realizing that

224.159 --> 226.819
like

227.22 --> 235.57999999999998
trying to identify the demon that stops

231.659 --> 235.57999999999998
me from doing certain things

237.959 --> 243.18
like how that works and that's the thing

240.54 --> 244.739
that well I figured out like even when I

243.18 --> 247.28
was a teen

244.739 --> 247.28
but

248.519 --> 255.659
it's very tricky working with it

252.42 --> 257.15999999999997
has to do with tension management

255.659 --> 260.889
and tension on the inside

257.16 --> 260.889
[Music]

262.74 --> 267.86
because

264.0 --> 271.919
it's like if I want something too much

267.86 --> 274.32
then my enthusiasm energy basically

271.919 --> 276.18
becomes bewildered

274.32 --> 280.68
and then

276.18 --> 283.919
I actually when I'm having a great time

280.68 --> 288.5
can get really suddenly

283.919 --> 288.5
it's like bipolar I can get bipolar

289.259 --> 293.06
through my high enthusiasm

294.84 --> 298.919
like if suddenly something seems like

296.88 --> 300.06
it's not going my way anymore for

298.919 --> 302.59999999999997
example

300.06 --> 302.6
right

303.72 --> 306.38000000000005
and

308.04 --> 314.40000000000003
I contemplate these kind of things too

311.1 --> 315.54
much and I wonder sometimes am I just am

314.4 --> 320.34
I

315.54 --> 322.62
guarding myself or am I reinforcing it

320.34 --> 325.979
by just contemplating that all the time

322.62 --> 330.62
because it's all Based on data from

325.979 --> 330.62
interactions in other states of mind

330.66 --> 336.84000000000003
but also the experiences of being well

334.199 --> 338.699
very focused and all that going out to

336.84 --> 342.11999999999995
doing something like that and then

338.699 --> 345.6
really losing that Focus

342.12 --> 348.72
so I'm trying to identify what it is

345.6 --> 354.47900000000004
that's causing that

348.72 --> 357.53900000000004
because I have great adaptability

354.479 --> 360.86
but this thing

357.539 --> 360.86
like negates that

363.06 --> 369.8
and that is the fact that from a very

366.539 --> 373.32
rational point of view

369.8 --> 375.18
even though it is kind of ethereal what

373.32 --> 376.979
I'm trying to describe I'm calling it a

375.18 --> 379.08
demon but it I mean it's not literally

376.979 --> 381.139
that it's not

379.08 --> 385.919
remotely

381.139 --> 389.1
substantial it's all internal

385.919 --> 391.31899999999996
is basically in the information Realm

389.1 --> 395.94
but on my inside

391.319 --> 399.259
in my experience what I my interpersonal

395.94 --> 399.259
communication Etc

400.38 --> 404.18
Love Letter Sage it's you

418.62 --> 424.319
anyway I don't have to even necessarily

421.68 --> 425.819
like even elaborately talk about it for

424.319 --> 427.86
myself I don't know if any of you

425.819 --> 429.72
actually care about this at all

427.86 --> 431.88
maybe you just feel oh Arwin just needs

429.72 --> 433.56
to get that thing out of his way so he

431.88 --> 435.139
can get focused or something and then he

433.56 --> 438.66
would be right

435.139 --> 440.16
it is partially why I'm doing it also on

438.66 --> 443.78000000000003
my shows

440.16 --> 443.78000000000003
and for long-term study

444.9 --> 449.75899999999996
but

446.28 --> 451.31899999999996
it's good to remember that

449.759 --> 454.199
remember

451.319 --> 457.08000000000004
how I dealt with it back then

454.199 --> 458.759
that it is surmountable but that it also

457.08 --> 461.81899999999996
reveals

458.759 --> 463.68
in when I engage that I have weaknesses

461.819 --> 465.90000000000003
much more

463.68 --> 468.36
and that is very hard for me to handle

465.9 --> 472.4
so it's like can you handle being strong

468.36 --> 472.40000000000003
and weak at the same time

473.88 --> 480.68
well what happens is I tend to become

477.479 --> 480.68
kind of bipolar then

480.78 --> 485.65999999999997
or it's not strong and weak it's strong

482.88 --> 485.65999999999997
and vulnerable

486.74 --> 493.199
because a lot of my strength also does

489.96 --> 495.12
kind of rely on just the environment on

493.199 --> 497.94
how other people are

495.12 --> 501.479
and if other people are like Troublesome

497.94 --> 504.06
or have restless inner world or terrible

501.479 --> 505.68
in a world that literally starts to rub

504.06 --> 508.759
off on me if

505.68 --> 508.759
I can't like

508.979 --> 513.3
please on a spiritual level have

510.9 --> 516.4399999999999
authority over it in the sense that I

513.3 --> 516.4399999999999
can force them to stop

516.839 --> 523.2600000000001
right if it's just a social Dynamic and

520.14 --> 527.399
you're all equals then you just have to

523.26 --> 530.399
be lucky enough that you can stop such

527.399 --> 533.519
actions because you could compare it to

530.399 --> 537.779
like Gammas coming after you

533.519 --> 540.0
I've always had that even when I was

537.779 --> 541.8
younger

540.0 --> 544.86
gammas

541.8 --> 547.5
were part of the reason I got really

544.86 --> 550.6800000000001
scared off as a teenager

547.5 --> 555.019
in trying to like

550.68 --> 555.019
mingle get around and like

555.18 --> 560.279
get jobs and all that

558.06 --> 564.66
because there were just people

560.279 --> 568.5
that would always start picking on me

564.66 --> 571.0799999999999
just for how I am and sometimes

568.5 --> 574.1
including racism which is really bizarre

571.08 --> 574.1
to me

574.98 --> 583.1
because I'm not just typically White

580.32 --> 583.1
that happened

583.44 --> 588.3000000000001
it feels it feels extra odd now

586.019 --> 589.68
complaining about that I'm not really

588.3 --> 592.019
complaining about it's just I'm

589.68 --> 596.519
referencing it but with like all the

592.019 --> 600.08
hassle that's now like oh racism yeah I

596.519 --> 600.08
actually been through racism

605.399 --> 611.16
yeah but it I mean I never saw it as

608.88 --> 612.779
like oh my God we have to stop those

611.16 --> 614.279
people

612.779 --> 617.279
no

614.279 --> 620.16
it's always for me has been about how

617.279 --> 621.6
can you be strong enough

620.16 --> 624.6
to

621.6 --> 626.88
stop them doing it to like gain their

624.6 --> 629.1800000000001
respect and I have been successful at

626.88 --> 629.18
that

633.3 --> 637.74
right and not by gamma raging at them

635.64 --> 641.1
how dare you being racist I've never

637.74 --> 643.7
done that I don't have that response

641.1 --> 643.7
typically

646.5 --> 650.64
right I mean

648.48 --> 653.04
that one time with flat side what is it

650.64 --> 655.5
now two weeks ago everybody still had

653.04 --> 657.8389999999999
wrenches and this woman this Dutch woman

655.5 --> 660.06
just came after me and got racist I got

657.839 --> 662.6600000000001
really outraged

660.06 --> 666.0
but it's because

662.66 --> 668.8199999999999
just of this scenario that is like if it

666.0 --> 671.279
was not public

668.82 --> 674.279
you know I wouldn't really give a [ __ ] I

671.279 --> 676.26
just kind of like really you you really

674.279 --> 678.36
think that that's so weak

676.26 --> 680.519
I'm so sorry for you that you actually

678.36 --> 683.24
think that

680.519 --> 686.519
right but when it's public and it's like

683.24 --> 688.86
my scene because hey flat side also is

686.519 --> 692.72
my scene it's flatter Thurs it's flat

688.86 --> 692.72
Earth debates adjacent

693.18 --> 700.079
right same lingo same arguments also

696.68 --> 702.42
it's like yeah I'm there also to protect

700.079 --> 706.3389999999999
my club

702.42 --> 706.3389999999999
it's my club it's my group

706.68 --> 711.3
my family in a way my intellectual

709.38 --> 715.8
family you could say my online family

711.3 --> 717.54
and so that made me like hey what you're

715.8 --> 720.3199999999999
a flat earther

717.54 --> 723.54
you shouldn't yeah like how dare you

720.32 --> 725.82
that's really embarrassing and like like

723.54 --> 728.519
people can pick up on that and really

725.82 --> 732.2600000000001
put a loop over that and then say look

728.519 --> 732.26
flat earthers are racist

733.079 --> 739.079
I was more afraid of that than actually

735.959 --> 740.7199999999999
being pointed out for oh like you're

739.079 --> 744.5999999999999
that typical

740.72 --> 748.74
Indonesian type which is like okay yeah

744.6 --> 751.0790000000001
in a way I am it's true

748.74 --> 753.48
but I'm not like the worst of them

751.079 --> 756.3
absolutely not I'm actually really

753.48 --> 759.86
delicate with women

756.3 --> 759.8599999999999
sometimes a little bit too much

763.32 --> 767.899
but I am a hothead

765.66 --> 770.519
mm-hmm

767.899 --> 772.76
which apparently a lot of Indonesian men

770.519 --> 772.76
are

774.06 --> 777.9799999999999
even though I'm not even fully

775.98 --> 781.62
Indonesian I'm like 1 8.

777.98 --> 786.32
[Music]

781.62 --> 786.32
anyway what is this

787.56 --> 792.56
okay donors for pgp what

792.779 --> 798.68
is that supposed to be some racist joke

794.76 --> 798.68
or something I don't really care

804.24 --> 810.839
right but anyway kind of got sidetracked

807.779 --> 813.4399999999999
from inner demons to

810.839 --> 813.44
well

813.54 --> 818.519
going around socializing in my attitude

816.0 --> 821.96
I mean because I am very protective like

818.519 --> 825.169
I am very protective

821.96 --> 825.169
[Music]

826.68 --> 832.4399999999999
it's like even when I feel like really

829.68 --> 835.56
weak and destroyed

832.44 --> 838.1
by whatever situation

835.56 --> 841.38
I find solace

838.1 --> 843.4200000000001
in protecting somebody else

841.38 --> 845.1
like that's literally one of the few

843.42 --> 849.0
things then that

845.1 --> 851.399
makes me feel okay about myself is like

849.0 --> 853.86
I can just be a little bit extra nice to

851.399 --> 857.42
somebody right they wouldn't even have

853.86 --> 857.42
to know me all that elaborately

860.82 --> 866.1
but I've noticed that there is it's like

863.459 --> 868.5
a stabilizing social reflex almost like

866.1 --> 870.12
if something really humiliating happens

868.5 --> 872.82
to me

870.12 --> 875.639
then I get angry perhaps

872.82 --> 878.1600000000001
or not and it just feel really bad

875.639 --> 880.44
and then to kind of get away from that I

878.16 --> 883.079
get really nice

880.44 --> 886.399
to people not involved in that situation

883.079 --> 886.399
it's like a switch

886.74 --> 892.62
to another Circle social communication

889.56 --> 894.1199999999999
Circle and then I like get really

892.62 --> 896.579
positive

894.12 --> 899.639
and that seems to help

896.579 --> 901.92
and the funny thing is I did that I did

899.639 --> 904.0790000000001
that this weekend last weekend

901.92 --> 905.88
right I got really

904.079 --> 910.019
enraged

905.88 --> 912.12
on Saturday I mean my my roommate even

910.019 --> 913.68
knocked on my door

912.12 --> 916.38
right

913.68 --> 919.38
but then after that

916.38 --> 922.56
like I've just been I've been

919.38 --> 924.18
consistently nice for a while and I

922.56 --> 927.899
I've been kind of like annoyed because

924.18 --> 930.899
I've been trying to be nice to him and

927.899 --> 934.44
at least polite and all that and just

930.899 --> 936.66
wish each other a happy or a nice meal

934.44 --> 938.399
when they're cooking and all that and he

936.66 --> 940.68
kind of like refused that for a long

938.399 --> 942.6
time but I think it has to do more with

940.68 --> 944.579
this in their struggles because he's

942.6 --> 946.44
apparently had a burnout he never even

944.579 --> 949.3389999999999
told me yet

946.44 --> 949.339
but he had that

949.38 --> 952.22
I didn't know

952.5 --> 957.42
right he didn't he's still not told me

955.079 --> 960.2399999999999
directly I just overheard him in a

957.42 --> 961.74
conversation like a week ago

960.24 --> 963.72
but

961.74 --> 966.0600000000001
yeah I thought like oh no we're gonna

963.72 --> 968.94
get into like a spat or something after

966.06 --> 970.92
Saturday but it didn't happen and I

968.94 --> 974.5790000000001
actually like carried on and being extra

970.92 --> 976.38
nice and it all hit and now I'm like

974.579 --> 978.4799999999999
really good with that roommate we even

976.38 --> 979.98
like sort of have conversations in the

978.48 --> 982.44
kitchen which is something that's never

979.98 --> 983.519
really happened before

982.44 --> 988.1
yeah

983.519 --> 988.1
ah so I'm building on

988.199 --> 992.88
I guess my home ground

990.54 --> 995.3389999999999
socially reinforcing my home ground

992.88 --> 998.3389999999999
which is really necessary I mean I don't

995.339 --> 1001.6990000000001
have like a family and kids so this is

998.339 --> 1005.139
the second best thing you still need

1001.699 --> 1005.139
to secure your home

1005.839 --> 1010.399
like spiritually

1007.88 --> 1012.32
to make sure that everybody directly in

1010.399 --> 1014.68
your direct surroundings can be relied

1012.32 --> 1014.6800000000001
upon

1015.139 --> 1019.04
it's very important for stability for

1018.079 --> 1022.779
your own

1019.04 --> 1022.779
emotional and spiritual security

1023.24 --> 1027.4
okay Dunner I don't know whatever

1033.679 --> 1038.799
so I'm doing pretty good except well

1036.199 --> 1038.799
financially

1040.64 --> 1046.5200000000002
I mean I still have some stuff

1043.88 --> 1048.3190000000002
to get around for the rest of the week

1046.52 --> 1051.44
but I mean

1048.319 --> 1053.299
I know it's gonna

1051.44 --> 1056.1200000000001
yeah run out

1053.299 --> 1059.36
so I could really use some support

1056.12 --> 1062.059
and hopefully people enjoyed my show

1059.36 --> 1065.3799999999999
yesterday which was like a fully one

1062.059 --> 1065.3799999999999
subject show pretty much

1066.38 --> 1071.179
right the thermosphere I got some

1069.02 --> 1073.52
feedback and a lot of Gammas went all

1071.179 --> 1076.16
ballistic on me again

1073.52 --> 1077.96
in the in the comment section which is

1076.16 --> 1079.88
fine

1077.96 --> 1081.74
I mean they really don't have a case

1079.88 --> 1084.2600000000002
they just don't

1081.74 --> 1086.48
like all the the points that I made none

1084.26 --> 1089.059
of it was addressed of course

1086.48 --> 1091.96
like oh that the way that was measured

1089.059 --> 1091.96
through kinetic energy

1093.08 --> 1097.6999999999998
my issues with that none of it was

1095.299 --> 1099.5
addressed they didn't give nobody gave

1097.7 --> 1102.26
an example

1099.5 --> 1104.72
like oh here is how they

1102.26 --> 1107.299
basically measure the kinetic energy of

1104.72 --> 1108.5
somewhere mid-air and they it's like uh

1107.299 --> 1111.9189999999999
what is it

1108.5 --> 1113.299
100 feet up or something but mid-air and

1111.919 --> 1115.7
they could just measure the kinetic

1113.299 --> 1118.46
energy and then they had something that

1115.7 --> 1120.38
they could actually confirm it on the

1118.46 --> 1123.98
location that that's actually correct

1120.38 --> 1129.0200000000002
right well I'd love to see that you see

1123.98 --> 1132.679
I'm not just you have nothing I only do

1129.02 --> 1135.1399999999999
that really to get you moving to start

1132.679 --> 1138.74
Gathering that evidence

1135.14 --> 1139.76
that I actually want it's like yeah I

1138.74 --> 1143.299
mean

1139.76 --> 1146.0
maybe they can do it with that device

1143.299 --> 1148.82
but how would you know

1146.0 --> 1150.5
they could just say they can do these

1148.82 --> 1154.46
things

1150.5 --> 1156.44
unless you can confirm it

1154.46 --> 1158.74
then how do you know any of it is even

1156.44 --> 1158.74
true

1162.679 --> 1168.22
but no responses just a lot of whining

1168.679 --> 1173.3600000000001
and gaslighting trying to be like oh you

1171.679 --> 1174.74
don't understand anything it's like oh

1173.36 --> 1177.3799999999999
yeah right yeah yeah

1174.74 --> 1179.539
sure I didn't understand but I don't get

1177.38 --> 1181.46
any in detail responses though to

1179.539 --> 1183.32
anything I said

1181.46 --> 1184.58
so

1183.32 --> 1188.84
guess

1184.58 --> 1192.9189999999999
it's just gonna be forgotten about again

1188.84 --> 1195.9189999999999
right nobody's actually gonna

1192.919 --> 1199.1000000000001
become persistent enough out there to

1195.919 --> 1202.22
like no no Arwin is wrong

1199.1 --> 1205.9399999999998
and that those things really work here

1202.22 --> 1208.28
it is here is that actual test see it

1205.94 --> 1210.799
can measure the kinetic energy of

1208.28 --> 1213.62
transparent gases somewhere

1210.799 --> 1216.62
like mid-air you can do that here and

1213.62 --> 1219.6789999999999
and see we had the device right there to

1216.62 --> 1223.1599999999999
confirm its direct kinetic measurement

1219.679 --> 1226.64
yeah so we were right okay okay well

1223.16 --> 1229.419
where is it where's that can you show me

1226.64 --> 1232.2800000000002
can you show me like the demonstration

1229.419 --> 1235.039
of them doing that

1232.28 --> 1236.299
or at least an official descriptive

1235.039 --> 1239.96
report

1236.299 --> 1242.36
of such a test having been done

1239.96 --> 1244.179
with Witnesses yeah

1242.36 --> 1247.82
to actually

1244.179 --> 1250.46
scientifically scientifically

1247.82 --> 1253.1
prove that it's actually physically real

1250.46 --> 1254.8400000000001
you know you you'd like to have those

1253.1 --> 1258.02
things don't you or or everything is

1254.84 --> 1262.24
just in her head oh no we don't need no

1258.02 --> 1262.24
physical confirmation no

1264.5 --> 1269.32
I think you do need that physical

1266.48 --> 1269.32
confirmation

1270.799 --> 1274.46
you're gonna

1272.24 --> 1277.059
use some device

1274.46 --> 1279.26
to at a distance

1277.059 --> 1280.6399999999999
measure something

1279.26 --> 1283.82
then

1280.64 --> 1286.2800000000002
well if you claim that it can do that

1283.82 --> 1288.6789999999999
this is cool but you still have to

1286.28 --> 1290.86
confirm that it is correctly measuring

1288.679 --> 1290.8600000000001
it

1290.9 --> 1294.679
at a distance

1292.52 --> 1297.9189999999999
can't just point it say like oh this is

1294.679 --> 1299.659
Serena yeah it works and then not do

1297.919 --> 1301.5200000000002
anything to actually confirm whether

1299.659 --> 1303.8600000000001
that reading was correct

1301.52 --> 1306.28
yeah

1303.86 --> 1306.28
anyway

1308.37 --> 1311.4499999999998
[Music]

1313.58 --> 1320.299
still monkey completely Oh no you're not

1316.28 --> 1322.22
getting all Nathan on us oh no stone

1320.299 --> 1324.5
monkey ah

1322.22 --> 1327.8600000000001
you thought this was your Global safe

1324.5 --> 1329.72
space did you Stone monkey really

1327.86 --> 1332.12
it isn't

1329.72 --> 1336.26
yeah this is not your safe space

1332.12 --> 1339.7399999999998
I mean I give equal rights to globers

1336.26 --> 1343.22
and flat earthers but yeah equal rights

1339.74 --> 1345.2
doesn't mean safe space you see

1343.22 --> 1347.84
I'm still going to

1345.2 --> 1348.799
shove people's heads and issues they

1347.84 --> 1351.559
have

1348.799 --> 1354.02
so with globers it is well what I do

1351.559 --> 1356.96
with globers

1354.02 --> 1359.44
and with flat earthers it's probably bad

1356.96 --> 1359.44
behavior

1360.5 --> 1365.12
and misleading thoughts

1362.78 --> 1367.6
because that still happens

1365.12 --> 1367.6
anyway

1371.179 --> 1376.8200000000002
am I willing to discuss how gas pressure

1373.88 --> 1379.5200000000002
is physically measured

1376.82 --> 1381.3799999999999
not particularly especially because it

1379.52 --> 1383.78
has absolutely nothing to do with the

1381.38 --> 1386.1200000000001
other subject right that's why you

1383.78 --> 1388.82
brought that up yesterday as well it has

1386.12 --> 1391.34
absolutely nothing to do

1388.82 --> 1394.4189999999999
with measuring kinetic energy at a

1391.34 --> 1394.4189999999999
distance huh

1395.78 --> 1401.32
a little distraction maneuver

1398.24 --> 1401.32
but yeah sure

1402.679 --> 1406.94
always guys pressure measure yeah it's

1404.96 --> 1408.2
measured by comparing it to other gas

1406.94 --> 1410.179
pressure

1408.2 --> 1412.94
or other pressure it's pressure

1410.179 --> 1415.039
comparison that's how you measure gas

1412.94 --> 1418.8400000000001
pressure

1415.039 --> 1418.84
a barometer is basically

1419.299 --> 1425.179
a tanker with material in it that has a

1423.08 --> 1428.4189999999999
very exact pressure

1425.179 --> 1431.0
and then you compare that pressure

1428.419 --> 1432.7990000000002
to the pressure that surrounds it and

1431.0 --> 1435.6
then it gives a reading that's how a

1432.799 --> 1438.73
barometer works

1435.6 --> 1438.73
[Music]

1441.1 --> 1447.3799999999999
yeah I mean I've explained that on this

1443.9 --> 1449.9
show before I know how it works

1447.38 --> 1453.98
yeah I might not be a mathematical

1449.9 --> 1457.0590000000002
genius or whatever well maybe I I'm not

1453.98 --> 1457.059
good at

1457.22 --> 1461.9
that mathematical reductionism or maybe

1459.679 --> 1465.0800000000002
I am good at I just hate it

1461.9 --> 1467.3600000000001
I find it repulsive and distractive

1465.08 --> 1469.8799999999999
and over generalizing people that do

1467.36 --> 1472.4599999999998
that over generalize they lose the big

1469.88 --> 1476.0
picture they lose oversight over what's

1472.46 --> 1477.38
real and so I avoided no cost I'm very

1476.0 --> 1480.44
descriptive

1477.38 --> 1483.2
yeah science doesn't need math

1480.44 --> 1485.78
scientific method is descriptive you can

1483.2 --> 1487.3400000000001
describe it you can communicate it in

1485.78 --> 1490.96
any language

1487.34 --> 1490.9599999999998
you don't have to use numbers

1492.44 --> 1497.8400000000001
and I like that about it

1495.26 --> 1501.039
keeps the focus on what's physical and

1497.84 --> 1501.039
tangible and real

1503.48 --> 1505.72
foreign

1506.179 --> 1510.3200000000002
so you don't lock yourself in with some

1508.46 --> 1514.1000000000001
mathematical formulas

1510.32 --> 1515.72
and then stop actually beholding the

1514.1 --> 1517.8799999999999
physical reality

1515.72 --> 1520.7
because that's what math does to you it

1517.88 --> 1523.5200000000002
draws you into a mathematical

1520.7 --> 1526.22
conceptual realm in your mind

1523.52 --> 1528.1399999999999
that you then pay attention to and

1526.22 --> 1530.659
puzzle things

1528.14 --> 1532.8200000000002
but doing that is like dipping in your

1530.659 --> 1535.1000000000001
imagination it's not really different if

1532.82 --> 1537.32
you dip in your imagination

1535.1 --> 1539.539
you don't really pay attention to the

1537.32 --> 1541.82
physical as much

1539.539 --> 1544.52
right

1541.82 --> 1547.6399999999999
because math doesn't really have to be

1544.52 --> 1550.779
physical at all or even relating to that

1547.64 --> 1550.779
it's just a structure

1551.9 --> 1558.0800000000002
but if you don't use math then every

1555.38 --> 1559.8200000000002
time you describe something you're going

1558.08 --> 1562.8799999999999
to visualize the thing that you're

1559.82 --> 1564.799
describing you're going to be focused on

1562.88 --> 1567.38
the real world through your imagination

1564.799 --> 1568.82
but really more focused on the real

1567.38 --> 1571.159
world

1568.82 --> 1574.76
if you focus on math in your imagination

1571.159 --> 1575.96
you don't focus on the real world as

1574.76 --> 1577.52
much

1575.96 --> 1581.24
and that's

1577.52 --> 1582.799
very consistent how that works with

1581.24 --> 1584.84
everybody

1582.799 --> 1586.6399999999999
and you can tell people that are into

1584.84 --> 1588.74
math are often

1586.64 --> 1591.74
fantasists

1588.74 --> 1595.46
or they like it right

1591.74 --> 1598.039
they like fantasy or science fiction

1595.46 --> 1599.659
more more than the people that are not

1598.039 --> 1601.58
so much into math

1599.659 --> 1604.0390000000002
why is that it's because when you're

1601.58 --> 1606.86
into math you're into the

1604.039 --> 1609.14
Fantastical because math is basically

1606.86 --> 1611.0
fantastical

1609.14 --> 1613.039
in what sense

1611.0 --> 1615.62
in the sense that

1613.039 --> 1617.12
it is not really based on physical

1615.62 --> 1619.279
reality

1617.12 --> 1621.8799999999999
when you do that when you focus on that

1619.279 --> 1621.88
in your mind

1621.98 --> 1626.779
you're focusing on a virtual structure

1624.2 --> 1631.159
in your mind not

1626.779 --> 1634.279
a representation of the physical reality

1631.159 --> 1637.3400000000001
and so if you like that

1634.279 --> 1641.36
you like that not focusing on physical

1637.34 --> 1644.72
reality which is a form of escapism yeah

1641.36 --> 1646.52
then you're inclined to like math and

1644.72 --> 1649.48
you're inclined to like Science Fiction

1646.52 --> 1649.48
and Fantasy

1650.419 --> 1655.4
more like to really enjoy it more

1653.659 --> 1658.7600000000002
compared to the average person which

1655.4 --> 1659.779
would be like oh that's cool like yeah

1658.76 --> 1662.84
whatever

1659.779 --> 1665.179
no you like math

1662.84 --> 1668.4189999999999
really like it you're more inclined to

1665.179 --> 1669.919
also like Science Fiction and Fantasy

1668.419 --> 1672.5
more

1669.919 --> 1675.8600000000001
than if you wouldn't like math this is

1672.5 --> 1677.96
my prediction or my estimation

1675.86 --> 1680.9599999999998
now of course there's gonna be it's

1677.96 --> 1682.64
statistical right this claim is a

1680.96 --> 1685.159
statistical claim so there's gonna be

1682.64 --> 1688.279
exceptions of course

1685.159 --> 1690.44
but on average

1688.279 --> 1692.659
I've noticed this

1690.44 --> 1695.299
I've noticed this through well both

1692.659 --> 1699.74
sides because

1695.299 --> 1702.62
I was very interested in math people in

1699.74 --> 1705.94
school nerds I kind of was interested in

1702.62 --> 1708.7399999999998
nerds and much later while I got into

1705.94 --> 1710.6000000000001
also through that scene and kind of the

1708.74 --> 1712.4
same people those same people that were

1710.6 --> 1714.32
kind of math nerds and all that they

1712.4 --> 1717.5
were also into

1714.32 --> 1720.9399999999998
Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and

1717.5 --> 1720.94
dragon style role-playing

1721.1 --> 1724.8999999999999
it's they're connected

1726.679 --> 1731.539
it's like oh they're into math well then

1729.5 --> 1732.62
it's likely they're also into that kind

1731.539 --> 1734.72
of stuff

1732.62 --> 1737.5
the fantasy and Science Fiction it's

1734.72 --> 1737.5
just connected

1748.4 --> 1750.94
okay

1758.299 --> 1764.059
any any response to that

1761.84 --> 1766.539
Maybe not maybe you agree maybe you

1764.059 --> 1766.539
don't agree

1767.12 --> 1769.9399999999998
or maybe it's just a six minutes of

1769.159 --> 1771.2600000000002
silence

1769.94 --> 1773.98
[Music]

1771.26 --> 1773.98
cheers

1775.76 --> 1778.179
right

1785.419 --> 1788.2990000000002
okay

1787.039 --> 1792.5
thank you

1788.299 --> 1795.82
or maybe I'm gonna refresh my chat

1792.5 --> 1795.82
never really know

1796.34 --> 1801.98
nope

1798.98 --> 1804.76
just nobody's saying it's nothing

1801.98 --> 1804.76
all right

1811.72 --> 1814.819
[Music]

1818.26 --> 1823.64
but anyway I'll just start talking about

1821.419 --> 1825.44
myself again my internal mechanics yeah

1823.64 --> 1828.5590000000002
probably just

1825.44 --> 1830.96
no doesn't engage start talking about me

1828.559 --> 1833.44
again because I guess I'm just talking

1830.96 --> 1833.44
to myself

1834.08 --> 1836.559
right

1836.659 --> 1841.7
but I have been thinking a lot about

1838.7 --> 1845.059
what it would be like to actually

1841.7 --> 1847.039
get a bigger type game

1845.059 --> 1848.899
produced

1847.039 --> 1851.179
and how complicated that would be and

1848.899 --> 1853.76
what the type of dilemmas would be like

1851.179 --> 1855.799
what type of people would

1853.76 --> 1857.539
actually

1855.799 --> 1859.46
be involved

1857.539 --> 1861.98
in the creation of that and what

1859.46 --> 1863.48
dilemmas would that bring socially for

1861.98 --> 1866.0
me

1863.48 --> 1868.88
like what compromises

1866.0 --> 1872.44
am I likely

1868.88 --> 1872.44
face gonna face

1874.7 --> 1880.94
so yeah I'm taking it really serious

1878.179 --> 1883.3400000000001
also partially inspired by well what fox

1880.94 --> 1886.76
day talks about because he talks about

1883.34 --> 1890.74
his business and how he does it and it

1886.76 --> 1890.74
is really informative in that sense

1892.399 --> 1898.58
I can actually like get that

1896.24 --> 1901.1
because he's just he's actually doing it

1898.58 --> 1903.1399999999999
and he's pretty good at explaining it

1901.1 --> 1905.559
and being on point on what's really

1903.14 --> 1905.5590000000002
important

1905.659 --> 1910.22
so

1908.059 --> 1912.559
so I'm thinking about like yeah I mean

1910.22 --> 1914.6000000000001
if like what would it take to get

1912.559 --> 1916.76
something like that really done other

1914.6 --> 1918.32
than just a giant amount of money which

1916.76 --> 1919.76
I don't have

1918.32 --> 1922.1
what

1919.76 --> 1924.14
how would I get it done because if it's

1922.1 --> 1926.24
like oh well you just go to a bank and

1924.14 --> 1927.679
say I got this amazing yeah guess what

1926.24 --> 1929.419
the [ __ ] they're gonna do

1927.679 --> 1931.22
they're gonna [ __ ] it up they're gonna

1929.419 --> 1934.5800000000002
demand I [ __ ] it up

1931.22 --> 1936.44
maybe not at first but then eventually

1934.58 --> 1939.02
it's like oh yeah you got a halfway done

1936.44 --> 1940.88
oh okay yeah now you have to do this and

1939.02 --> 1943.22
that you have to put that freaking gay

1940.88 --> 1945.2600000000002
guy in there or we're not giving you the

1943.22 --> 1947.419
rest of the funding oh you didn't

1945.26 --> 1950.12
understand

1947.419 --> 1953.179
special claws in the contract did you oh

1950.12 --> 1955.34
yeah yeah

1953.179 --> 1957.8600000000001
so I'm not

1955.34 --> 1961.0
inclined to do that

1957.86 --> 1961.0
if you know what I mean

1961.22 --> 1966.38
if I even get that initial contract in

1964.76 --> 1968.6
the first instance

1966.38 --> 1970.5800000000002
there's a time like this

1968.6 --> 1974.26
another route would be to basically

1970.58 --> 1977.6
connect up with existing game companies

1974.26 --> 1980.36
but they will take complete domination

1977.6 --> 1982.34
that's what they typically do

1980.36 --> 1984.9799999999998
so you come with an idea and they would

1982.34 --> 1988.039
prefer to just buy your idea and then

1984.98 --> 1989.419
have full control over it and then you

1988.039 --> 1990.98
can [ __ ] off and then they'll just

1989.419 --> 1992.779
change half of it

1990.98 --> 1995.919
because that's what game companies

1992.779 --> 1995.919
typically tend to do

1998.659 --> 2004.48
so I don't know

2001.659 --> 2006.7600000000002
I don't know how it would actually roll

2004.48 --> 2009.46
out and manifest eventually

2006.76 --> 2013.26
what if I just get a good idea together

2009.46 --> 2013.26
then at least there's a script

2017.919 --> 2023.6200000000001
maybe I can eventually make a script out

2020.919 --> 2025.0
of it that's so good that technically it

2023.62 --> 2028.4399999999998
transcends

2025.0 --> 2028.44
Baldur's Gate itself

2029.26 --> 2032.5
because if I didn't have to connect it

2031.299 --> 2035.019
up with that

2032.5 --> 2038.32
then

2035.019 --> 2041.38
like the the freedom I would have to

2038.32 --> 2044.5
really make it more like I would want to

2041.38 --> 2047.14
play yeah and would be easier

2044.5 --> 2051.82
because it's much harder to follow in a

2047.14 --> 2053.859
in in an act requires more effort more

2051.82 --> 2056.619
research

2053.859 --> 2058.48
than if it's like a brand new

2056.619 --> 2060.76
idea

2058.48 --> 2063.879
right and if it is a brand new idea then

2060.76 --> 2066.3990000000003
it's also like basically

2063.879 --> 2068.379
the people involved they become the

2066.399 --> 2071.7999999999997
authors of it

2068.379 --> 2074.2599999999998
because they set the tone then so you're

2071.8 --> 2076.599
gonna then need them in the future so

2074.26 --> 2079.2000000000003
the chemistry has got to be right

2076.599 --> 2083.02
at the first stage because if it isn't

2079.2 --> 2086.5
then terrible people will have like

2083.02 --> 2088.899
Legacy over the story because they were

2086.5 --> 2091.659
the ones that were actually forming it

2088.899 --> 2094.06
shaping it the original and if it then

2091.659 --> 2097.119
really hits off but they're terrible

2094.06 --> 2100.2
people you're gonna be dealing with them

2097.119 --> 2104.2000000000003
potentially for the rest of your life

2100.2 --> 2107.58
or at least as long as as new games or

2104.2 --> 2109.839
yeah game processing

2107.58 --> 2112.359
business-wise I you know what I mean

2109.839 --> 2114.16
maybe you do maybe nobody does I don't

2112.359 --> 2116.68
know I wouldn't know because

2114.16 --> 2119.6189999999997
nobody has said anything for

2116.68 --> 2122.8199999999997
12 minutes straight

2119.619 --> 2122.82
so yeah I don't know

2129.04 --> 2133.599
it's hard to tell whether people get

2131.14 --> 2137.16
what you're talking about or don't when

2133.599 --> 2137.1600000000003
nobody says anything

2138.2 --> 2141.31
[Music]

2148.41 --> 2151.7999999999997
[Music]

2154.6 --> 2158.389
[Music]

2168.35 --> 2171.489
[Music]

2174.64 --> 2177.839
what's the talk

2179.2 --> 2184.4689999999996
I don't know what is the talk

2181.3 --> 2184.469
[Music]

2186.22 --> 2190.4199999999996
been talking for like 15 minutes and

2189.16 --> 2193.2999999999997
nothing

2190.42 --> 2197.099
nobody's there apparently so there's no

2193.3 --> 2197.099
talk here it's just me talking to myself

2199.599 --> 2205.3
the best bet is to sell it yeah so well

2202.24 --> 2208.4799999999996
yes I have a dream about something I can

2205.3 --> 2211.54
sell my dream and then it won't be mine

2208.48 --> 2214.2
anymore ooh I'll get some money

2211.54 --> 2214.2
great

2216.16 --> 2220.68
hey Steph Moretz welcome back

2224.26 --> 2229.3590000000004
yeah well look George Sanford if I'm

2227.56 --> 2232.24
gonna go like that was like oh I

2229.359 --> 2234.88
celibate game concept that'll work well

2232.24 --> 2237.64
then I'll just have to completely be

2234.88 --> 2239.859
different and figure out a revolutionary

2237.64 --> 2243.2799999999997
game concept by the way

2239.859 --> 2245.3199999999997
I can do that too it's just that this

2243.28 --> 2247.78
project was particularly personally

2245.32 --> 2249.94
inspiring because I want a good

2247.78 --> 2253.1400000000003
continuation of the original Baldur's

2249.94 --> 2253.14
Gate series

2253.54 --> 2257.22
and I have an idea for that

2264.46 --> 2268.78
but

2265.72 --> 2272.5
a way to kind of like see if anything

2268.78 --> 2274.7200000000003
about that could work is like somehow

2272.5 --> 2278.2
contacting

2274.72 --> 2281.5
Wizards of the Coast I guess

2278.2 --> 2283.54
and uh what is it the original gaming

2281.5 --> 2285.28
companies like I just need to like

2283.54 --> 2287.46
connect up well that's something not

2285.28 --> 2292.0
unpredictably

2287.46 --> 2294.099
experienced at doing by the way

2292.0 --> 2296.38
but

2294.099 --> 2297.88
I have to figure out what these people

2296.38 --> 2299.92
are doing

2297.88 --> 2302.94
and what they're like I mean they've all

2299.92 --> 2306.339
they might have all just become complete

2302.94 --> 2309.18
demonic [ __ ] for all I know I don't

2306.339 --> 2309.18
know if they have

2309.88 --> 2313.54
I mean a lot has happened in the in the

2311.98 --> 2315.52
last two decades

2313.54 --> 2318.22
they might have turned like completely

2315.52 --> 2320.44
[ __ ] up I'm not sure

2318.22 --> 2322.54
well in that case

2320.44 --> 2324.119
by the way

2322.54 --> 2327.4
I'd say

2324.119 --> 2330.28
contacting the Baldur's Gate Siege of

2327.4 --> 2332.26
the Dragon spear game makers which is

2330.28 --> 2335.26
like the last ones that have actually

2332.26 --> 2337.0
produced like that was the last game

2335.26 --> 2339.2200000000003
that was produced this Bob is great one

2337.0 --> 2343.14
and a half effectively

2339.22 --> 2343.14
really and I really do like it

2345.28 --> 2349.6600000000003
I think that they could be a good bet to

2347.38 --> 2352.359
do it because I liked how that was made

2349.66 --> 2353.7999999999997
it was good it was really true to the

2352.359 --> 2356.8199999999997
original story

2353.8 --> 2356.82
and the style

2358.24 --> 2362.8199999999997
so I think I should probably contact

2360.099 --> 2362.82
those people

2366.52 --> 2370.14
hey Nathan Oakley good to see you

2377.56 --> 2382.54
I like old games until I play them again

2380.02 --> 2386.099
okay

2382.54 --> 2389.8
right well look old games also have old

2386.099 --> 2392.98
interface problems right well guess what

2389.8 --> 2395.92
bulbitch gate was remade

2392.98 --> 2397.78
they call it enhanced notation it's

2395.92 --> 2400.06
exactly the same game except the

2397.78 --> 2402.4
interface is much better it's not even

2400.06 --> 2404.0789999999997
that difference it's just a lot of very

2402.4 --> 2406.599
handy

2404.079 --> 2408.52
in between solutions they literally like

2406.599 --> 2410.8
found a way through with a lot of things

2408.52 --> 2413.74
to make it more efficient make it better

2410.8 --> 2416.6800000000003
make it more fluid works great like

2413.74 --> 2419.02
really great so yeah I mean if I play

2416.68 --> 2421.7799999999997
the old Baldur's Gate which I still like

2419.02 --> 2424.42
have on the CD somewhere try to install

2421.78 --> 2426.52
that if I could get it to work yeah it

2424.42 --> 2429.94
would kind of suck because the

2426.52 --> 2433.619
interfaces back then were really shitty

2429.94 --> 2433.619
compared to the enhanced Edition

2433.78 --> 2436.5600000000004
right

2436.9 --> 2442.599
but that's the thing you can take old

2439.839 --> 2445.42
games that were awesome with a great

2442.599 --> 2448.839
story great feel great looks uh whatever

2445.42 --> 2451.54
you liked about it and then make the

2448.839 --> 2454.2599999999998
interface better that's what these guys

2451.54 --> 2454.2599999999998
have done

2454.54 --> 2458.2
made the enhanced editions not just

2456.82 --> 2460.7200000000003
Baldur's Gate by the way they made

2458.2 --> 2463.18
enhanced editions of all kinds of old

2460.72 --> 2466.18
popular old games

2463.18 --> 2468.46
and those games work a lot better

2466.18 --> 2470.44
that enhance the Nations they really

2468.46 --> 2472.3
tackled the interface

2470.44 --> 2473.8
and the gameplay

2472.3 --> 2475.42
with it

2473.8 --> 2478.7200000000003
that's what they're focused on is great

2475.42 --> 2482.4
you should try it

2478.72 --> 2482.3999999999996
iron 26.

2483.52 --> 2489.579
because you're these enhanced Edition

2485.56 --> 2493.7799999999997
games they have the fun of the game

2489.579 --> 2496.92
but not the the naggingness of the old

2493.78 --> 2496.92
interface issued

2499.72 --> 2503.3799999999997
that's yeah

2501.64 --> 2505.54
because back then we were used to that

2503.38 --> 2507.4
it's like everything was like that

2505.54 --> 2509.38
there was no

2507.4 --> 2511.6600000000003
more smooth

2509.38 --> 2513.7000000000003
operation

2511.66 --> 2516.04
it wasn't that smooth

2513.7 --> 2517.96
and an interface wasn't as well

2516.04 --> 2520.359
developed it was all relatively new

2517.96 --> 2523.06
still interfaces

2520.359 --> 2527.2
gooeys but

2523.06 --> 2529.9
that has developed a lot in the last few

2527.2 --> 2531.52
decades so that is you can literally

2529.9 --> 2532.96
take the old games and improve them

2531.52 --> 2535.72
that's what these guys have been doing

2532.96 --> 2538.18
is great love it

2535.72 --> 2541.2999999999997
good idea

2538.18 --> 2541.2999999999997
[Music]

2541.66 --> 2547.02
did they do that with RuneScape could be

2547.54 --> 2552.2799999999997
in which first yeah well if it's a

2549.4 --> 2554.14
newish version is was it the same game

2552.28 --> 2556.48
or was it just a

2554.14 --> 2558.04
newer version because that's another way

2556.48 --> 2559.78
that happens

2558.04 --> 2562.359
some games that are really successful

2559.78 --> 2563.619
they just keep bringing out new versions

2562.359 --> 2565.839
of it

2563.619 --> 2567.579
and then improve at that end and they

2565.839 --> 2570.099
kind of like abandon the old games

2567.579 --> 2572.8
mostly

2570.099 --> 2575.6800000000003
it's been a lot of more successful game

2572.8 --> 2578.2200000000003
companies do with successful games that

2575.68 --> 2578.22
are very popular

2581.74 --> 2587.52
same game updated right well then you

2583.96 --> 2587.52
probably played an enhanced Edition

2603.579 --> 2609.28
right yes like Tara just chill out with

2607.54 --> 2611.92
Des Moretz

2609.28 --> 2613.8390000000004
he is an undefense guy that's how I see

2611.92 --> 2615.579
him he might see himself as a glower I

2613.839 --> 2618.42
see him as an on-defense guy

2615.579 --> 2618.42
and that's fine

2619.06 --> 2622.839
I thought it was a great show where he

2621.28 --> 2625.92
came on

2622.839 --> 2625.92
so chill

2641.2 --> 2646.18
oh my God George Sandra have you been

2643.42 --> 2649.44
hanging around with Bev or something

2646.18 --> 2649.44
a [ __ ] sake George

2657.52 --> 2659.94
what

2678.64 --> 2682.0789999999997
the hell does that mean

2683.7 --> 2690.72
panels what the [ __ ] is that supposed to

2686.92 --> 2690.7200000000003
mean are you some kind of Nutter

2710.2 --> 2715.0789999999997
joystick I don't use a joystick

2716.5 --> 2719.52
what are you talking about

2738.16 --> 2744.7
yeah I don't use joysticks

2742.72 --> 2746.5
I could make a big bear joke out of and

2744.7 --> 2747.7599999999998
say I don't use joysticks because I'm

2746.5 --> 2749.38
not gay

2747.76 --> 2751.0600000000004
right

2749.38 --> 2753.76
but

2751.06 --> 2756.7
yeah I mean I have yours joysticks in

2753.76 --> 2757.96
the past and Commodore 64 joysticks are

2756.7 --> 2760.72
my favorite

2757.96 --> 2765.06
it's just one freaking button

2760.72 --> 2765.06
and a stick and that works great

2765.099 --> 2771.46
but I mean I

2767.26 --> 2775.8
since the PC ERA with mouses I haven't

2771.46 --> 2775.8
really played joystick games so

2780.41 --> 2785.2599999999998
[Music]

2782.619 --> 2787.7200000000003
hook up stuff dude oh so you use game

2785.26 --> 2789.94
consoles yeah well I'm not a game

2787.72 --> 2792.8799999999997
console guy

2789.94 --> 2795.64
I've been a little I mean last real game

2792.88 --> 2797.02
console I had was a Super Nintendo I

2795.64 --> 2799.7799999999997
love that

2797.02 --> 2805.48
great times

2799.78 --> 2807.78
but I mean all that other stuff I mean I

2805.48 --> 2813.119
like Super Nintendo because

2807.78 --> 2813.119
it it was pre 3D nonsense

2813.579 --> 2818.6800000000003
in retrospect I was still long and like

2815.98 --> 2821.02
3D like even like oh Star Fox and all

2818.68 --> 2823.359
that which is really primitive polygon

2821.02 --> 2824.8
3D but it was like oh this is really

2823.359 --> 2827.2599999999998
cool and interesting

2824.8 --> 2828.3390000000004
I was still very enthusiastic about 3D

2827.26 --> 2829.9
back then

2828.339 --> 2832.839
because they didn't know it was going to

2829.9 --> 2834.819
make me violently ill

2832.839 --> 2837.4
physically

2834.819 --> 2840.46
yet I didn't know that yet

2837.4 --> 2842.64
but I mean all those games were a lot of

2840.46 --> 2842.64
fun

2842.92 --> 2848.94
because they weren't 3D

2844.839 --> 2848.94
I just didn't realize it back then

2872.819 --> 2877.54
right yeah

2875.619 --> 2881.619
just as Moretz yes and if there's like

2877.54 --> 2884.88
supposed a joystick why yeah you just W

2881.619 --> 2884.88
ASD indeed

2894.28 --> 2898.3
uh-huh

2896.77 --> 2901.06
[Music]

2898.3 --> 2902.5600000000004
yeah yeah I've seen those like they're

2901.06 --> 2905.88
really old games

2902.56 --> 2905.88
cheap yeah I know

2906.819 --> 2910.92
but that's like really old stuff

2920.26 --> 2926.26
no I don't want that Mark why the hell

2923.859 --> 2930.0989999999997
would I want that

2926.26 --> 2932.38
I'm fine I don't need oh I want to get

2930.099 --> 2934.1800000000003
back into gaming no

2932.38 --> 2936.4
I want to actually get a freaking life

2934.18 --> 2938.319
I've I've gamed enough in my damn life

2936.4 --> 2940.599
already

2938.319 --> 2943.72
I don't wanna I wouldn't want to make a

2940.599 --> 2945.28
game perhaps I mean that's kind of the

2943.72 --> 2947.3799999999997
thing that I want I don't want to just

2945.28 --> 2950.94
be playing games more I've already

2947.38 --> 2950.94
played enough damn games

2955.06 --> 2959.5
I mean I'm still going to be playing

2956.56 --> 2961.599
games in between but I'm not like oh I

2959.5 --> 2964.54
really want to get into some new things

2961.599 --> 2967.06
and new gaming console like no [ __ ] off

2964.54 --> 2969.099
with that [ __ ]

2967.06 --> 2971.92
don't have the money

2969.099 --> 2974.38
and I don't want to just waste all my

2971.92 --> 2976.6800000000003
time doing that

2974.38 --> 2976.6800000000003
foreign

2977.44 --> 2982.599
what's the name for there isn't any

2980.26 --> 2984.88
I don't have a name yet talking about

2982.599 --> 2987.46
games so far so

2984.88 --> 2989.819
but I mean there's not really title

2987.46 --> 2989.819
Worthy

3019.27 --> 3022.679
[Music]

3023.9 --> 3029.28
the things that I want to do I don't

3026.339 --> 3032.18
know I there's not they're not available

3029.28 --> 3032.1800000000003
for me

3032.46 --> 3038.9
I actually I really want to get back

3034.92 --> 3038.9
into gardening I really do

3040.619 --> 3043.7000000000003
what yeah

3043.92 --> 3049.859
thing like

3045.72 --> 3052.3799999999997
well since my roommate basically put a

3049.859 --> 3054.54
barrier up there

3052.38 --> 3056.76
which I think is kind of weird

3054.54 --> 3058.859
but it's probably because she didn't

3056.76 --> 3062.0400000000004
like me walking back and forth and then

3058.859 --> 3064.859
be getting in view

3062.04 --> 3068.7
but I mean if that's gonna be there I

3064.859 --> 3070.92
might potentially over there

3068.7 --> 3073.04
maybe build a little Greenhouse or

3070.92 --> 3073.04
something

3075.54 --> 3080.3
but then again that would come with some

3077.64 --> 3080.2999999999997
costs that

3083.339 --> 3087.319
I could try

3093.0 --> 3098.16
although where am I actually gonna

3094.859 --> 3101.64
create it because I'm not gonna be

3098.16 --> 3103.68
sawing wood and all that [ __ ] in my room

3101.64 --> 3105.9
here

3103.68 --> 3109.2599999999998
so that's a bit of a problem that I

3105.9 --> 3113.3
don't really have any place here to get

3109.26 --> 3113.3
constructive and and build

3114.3 --> 3118.579
something out of wood

3115.98 --> 3118.579
here

3120.3 --> 3125.7000000000003
could you explain a bit more about how

3123.359 --> 3129.02
there's no firmament

3125.7 --> 3129.02
what okay

3130.5 --> 3135.72
well I don't know if there's no

3132.599 --> 3138.619
firmament the the point is is that

3135.72 --> 3142.2
the word firmament

3138.619 --> 3144.7200000000003
implies certain things Associates in

3142.2 --> 3146.819
ways but it

3144.72 --> 3150.68
it's not

3146.819 --> 3150.68
it doesn't say what it is

3151.98 --> 3159.66
right it's a Biblical phrase

3155.22 --> 3161.819
and like even a rakia there's all kinds

3159.66 --> 3163.6189999999997
of issues the problem is that all the

3161.819 --> 3167.2799999999997
Flat Earth doesn't know it's it's the

3163.619 --> 3170.88
Dome is it because you're dumb dumb dumb

3167.28 --> 3173.0400000000004
dumb your domes your Dome heads you

3170.88 --> 3175.8
insist that

3173.04 --> 3178.2
that firmament is the Dome well that's

3175.8 --> 3181.8590000000004
your [ __ ] problem because you can't

3178.2 --> 3184.7
actually prove that it even means that

3181.859 --> 3184.7
okay

3185.4 --> 3192.619
you can't infer a direct shape from the

3189.839 --> 3192.619
word firmament

3193.28 --> 3199.3190000000004
nor is it addressed within the Bible as

3198.119 --> 3202.319
to

3199.319 --> 3202.319
properties

3202.98 --> 3211.92
they don't say what it is you see it's

3207.78 --> 3216.98
not in the Bible telling you what the

3211.92 --> 3216.98
firmament is it's roughly described

3217.5 --> 3220.88
it's like a covering

3221.579 --> 3228.3
or a tent

3223.5 --> 3230.94
but they don't say exactly what it is or

3228.3 --> 3234.2400000000002
what it does it's just the point oh this

3230.94 --> 3236.2200000000003
is there it's like this something that's

3234.24 --> 3238.3799999999997
it that's the best you got they don't

3236.22 --> 3240.8999999999996
have anything more you can't claim it's

3238.38 --> 3243.5
a dome it's a dome you don't have the

3240.9 --> 3243.5
proof for that

3243.839 --> 3249.7799999999997
yeah you don't know what you do know

3246.48 --> 3252.78
however is through physics

3249.78 --> 3254.7000000000003
you know that there has to be a limited

3252.78 --> 3257.579
volume in order for there to be gas

3254.7 --> 3261.18
pressure here at ground level

3257.579 --> 3265.579
so there is an end to the volume in

3261.18 --> 3265.5789999999997
which this gas can be

3265.74 --> 3270.7799999999997
now whether that's because we're

3267.599 --> 3273.6600000000003
contained in half a bubble

3270.78 --> 3274.6800000000003
or whether we're contained in some kind

3273.66 --> 3278.339
of a

3274.68 --> 3280.3799999999997
Square potentially looping with a flat

3278.339 --> 3281.94
top

3280.38 --> 3285.2400000000002
you can't

3281.94 --> 3287.42
know that from the word firmament in the

3285.24 --> 3287.4199999999996
Bible

3287.46 --> 3291.059
but you can know that there has to be a

3289.5 --> 3293.46
limited volume so that there would have

3291.059 --> 3295.6400000000003
to be some kind of end now whether that

3293.46 --> 3295.64
is

3296.04 --> 3301.8
a covering and there's more Beyond

3299.46 --> 3303.119
like literally a glass Dome and there's

3301.8 --> 3306.3590000000004
more outside

3303.119 --> 3307.92
or whether it's literally the end of

3306.359 --> 3310.859
material

3307.92 --> 3314.52
the end at the end of volume for

3310.859 --> 3316.2599999999998
material to move into which I would call

3314.52 --> 3318.599
Norm space

3316.26 --> 3320.3390000000004
and it's just cut off it's a flat top

3318.599 --> 3322.02
it's cut off there's no physical

3320.339 --> 3325.02
structure

3322.02 --> 3328.2
in place really it's just a call off

3325.02 --> 3330.74
point and it was conceived of as a

3328.2 --> 3330.74
firmament

3330.839 --> 3335.88
because they couldn't imagine it there

3332.76 --> 3338.3390000000004
would literally be no more volume for

3335.88 --> 3340.619
material to move into

3338.339 --> 3344.339
like even as they might have like Ash

3340.619 --> 3346.98
Street astral traveled and like

3344.339 --> 3350.16
gazed upon it with their spiritual eye

3346.98 --> 3351.9
like Guided by Angels or something they

3350.16 --> 3353.94
might have still not understood what

3351.9 --> 3356.1600000000003
that was that they saw

3353.94 --> 3357.839
you see they could have still thought oh

3356.16 --> 3359.22
wow it looks it's reflecting or

3357.839 --> 3361.619
something and it looks like a glass

3359.22 --> 3364.14
ceiling because they can't conceive like

3361.619 --> 3365.6400000000003
yeah you think that that might be glass

3364.14 --> 3367.859
because that's your Association

3365.64 --> 3369.96
intuitively from what you've experienced

3367.859 --> 3373.38
on Earth but

3369.96 --> 3376.14
it might literally just be there's

3373.38 --> 3378.54
literally physically nothing Beyond it

3376.14 --> 3380.52
and nothing could ever physically be

3378.54 --> 3383.579
beyond that point

3380.52 --> 3386.46
and it would seem like a a perfect flat

3383.579 --> 3390.92
mirror but it isn't it's simply

3386.46 --> 3390.92
non-space and nothing can go through it

3392.7 --> 3397.68
right and as spirits

3395.46 --> 3399.839
like through astral traveling through

3397.68 --> 3402.18
astral projection they might have in

3399.839 --> 3404.94
spirit like even been Guided by angels

3402.18 --> 3407.1189999999997
in the in the way past prophets and all

3404.94 --> 3407.119
that

3408.059 --> 3413.8190000000004
and like Apostles or whatever whatever

3410.4 --> 3416.1600000000003
they were doing they might have even the

3413.819 --> 3418.2599999999998
Book of Enoch like gazed upon it like

3416.16 --> 3419.16
wow it's like there's a mirror there or

3418.26 --> 3422.1600000000003
something

3419.16 --> 3424.44
but again how would they conceive that

3422.16 --> 3425.8799999999997
it wouldn't be a mirror when that's the

3424.44 --> 3427.079
only thing I have to compare to they

3425.88 --> 3430.8
might have never even thought like

3427.079 --> 3432.599
there's no more space beyond they might

3430.8 --> 3435.599
simply not have been able to conceive

3432.599 --> 3437.52
that there would be a limit

3435.599 --> 3440.28
entirely

3437.52 --> 3441.72
it wouldn't have occurred to them

3440.28 --> 3444.44
they might have thought no it's

3441.72 --> 3444.4399999999996
Unlimited

3447.24 --> 3452.16
it's a very youthful way of thinking by

3450.359 --> 3455.16
the way when you're young you think

3452.16 --> 3457.5589999999997
there's unlimited of everything

3455.16 --> 3460.22
infinite amount of people infinite

3457.559 --> 3460.2200000000003
amount of room

3460.38 --> 3465.6600000000003
of course outer space and all that and

3462.96 --> 3468.359
the nonsense talk on television it plays

3465.66 --> 3469.859
into that to reinforce that notion that

3468.359 --> 3471.48
youthful I didn't know there's infinite

3469.859 --> 3473.4
of everything infinite time Infinite

3471.48 --> 3476.2400000000002
Space infinite people

3473.4 --> 3476.2400000000002
there's so much

3477.48 --> 3483.92
to cut off that idea that no there is

3480.66 --> 3483.92
actually a limit

3500.3 --> 3504.98
saying the mirror is on the wall

3507.319 --> 3511.819
what the [ __ ] are you talking about Mark

3526.619 --> 3533.96
not talking about mirror on the wall I'm

3529.92 --> 3533.96
talking about what they might have seen

3534.119 --> 3539.819
when they actually projected like

3537.66 --> 3542.819
people from the past

3539.819 --> 3545.04
that were involved in making of the Old

3542.819 --> 3546.54
Testament for example and

3545.04 --> 3550.319
all that

3546.54 --> 3554.339
might have traveled in spirit form

3550.319 --> 3556.5589999999997
Guided by Angels arguably and seen the

3554.339 --> 3558.119
top and then they would have thought it

3556.559 --> 3560.9
was a mirror

3558.119 --> 3560.9
or something

3561.0 --> 3567.54
but not realizing that it's simply not

3565.26 --> 3570.2400000000002
an object that they were looking at but

3567.54 --> 3573.68
the lack of available volume for

3570.24 --> 3577.64
material to be able to move into

3573.68 --> 3577.64
non-space right

3582.059 --> 3589.0400000000004
what the [ __ ] are you talking about Mark

3584.64 --> 3589.04
you're not making any damn sense

3592.619 --> 3597.839
what the hell are you blabbering about

3594.78 --> 3599.46
mirror is on the wall what the [ __ ] are

3597.839 --> 3601.319
you talking about

3599.46 --> 3603.0
you're not talking about what I'm

3601.319 --> 3605.7599999999998
talking about what the hell are you

3603.0 --> 3607.92
talking about why are you suddenly

3605.76 --> 3609.78
breaking in the conversation with

3607.92 --> 3612.559
something that's completely not related

3609.78 --> 3612.559
obviously

3618.859 --> 3622.52
incoherent blabbering

3624.18 --> 3627.5699999999997
I'm trying to describe something really

3626.22 --> 3628.68
complicated here

3627.57 --> 3630.839
[Music]

3628.68 --> 3632.7599999999998
it's not your cue to bring in something

3630.839 --> 3635.969
that's obviously not related

3632.76 --> 3635.969
[Music]

3639.24 --> 3644.9599999999996
just because there's a word mirror in it

3642.18 --> 3644.96
[ __ ] sake

3648.119 --> 3650.54
beautiful

3654.299 --> 3659.819
right might have not been a mirror they

3656.76 --> 3661.44
were looking at it might have been just

3659.819 --> 3662.54
black

3661.44 --> 3664.92
like

3662.54 --> 3667.2
velvet perfect black it could have been

3664.92 --> 3670.5
that it does I don't even know if it is

3667.2 --> 3673.5589999999997
like a mirror right I don't know the

3670.5 --> 3676.559
full implications of what non-space

3673.559 --> 3678.42
would be like whether light could go

3676.559 --> 3683.46
through it or not I don't understand

3678.42 --> 3689.339
light enough to be certain whether it

3683.46 --> 3692.18
could actually exist outside of material

3689.339 --> 3692.18
actually

3692.819 --> 3699.48
yeah because the real true nature of

3696.359 --> 3701.819
light is very complicated turning out to

3699.48 --> 3704.88
be more and more and more complicated

3701.819 --> 3706.799
than I even thought originally

3704.88 --> 3708.359
and yeah there's no freaking ether

3706.799 --> 3710.359
involved

3708.359 --> 3712.98
in that sense

3710.359 --> 3717.48
if there would be an ether necessary

3712.98 --> 3720.2400000000002
then material is that ether matter might

3717.48 --> 3722.599
be the condition that light needs to

3720.24 --> 3722.5989999999997
exist

3725.7 --> 3732.66
it's certainly the only way we can even

3729.18 --> 3734.819
perceive it exists that it is there is

3732.66 --> 3735.7799999999997
through matter yeah there's no matter

3734.819 --> 3738.119
then

3735.78 --> 3742.28
you don't see a beam of light because

3738.119 --> 3742.28
there's no dust it's reflecting off

3743.4 --> 3746.579
Etc

3744.9 --> 3749.46
so I don't know

3746.579 --> 3752.1600000000003
what it seemed what

3749.46 --> 3755.2200000000003
the barrier

3752.16 --> 3757.5
the end of available volume if you'd

3755.22 --> 3759.4199999999996
look at it from hanging underneath it

3757.5 --> 3761.52
which I don't think you could physically

3759.42 --> 3763.26
do but maybe in spirit you could do

3761.52 --> 3765.119
through astral projection

3763.26 --> 3767.0400000000004
if you'd look at it I don't know if it

3765.119 --> 3769.859
just be black

3767.04 --> 3773.22
like velvet perfect black and super hard

3769.859 --> 3775.319
and nothing is just black

3773.22 --> 3777.0
which would might be pretty hard to even

3775.319 --> 3779.16
see because you're probably gonna see

3777.0 --> 3782.28
black everywhere I don't even know if

3779.16 --> 3784.799
you would still see blue underneath you

3782.28 --> 3786.6600000000003
at that height

3784.799 --> 3789.18
you might though

3786.66 --> 3791.64
but that it would just be like is

3789.18 --> 3794.3999999999996
perfect black or that it's actually you

3791.64 --> 3797.4
kind of see a mirror you start to see a

3794.4 --> 3798.78
mirror image of below

3797.4 --> 3801.92
or something

3798.78 --> 3801.92
as I don't know

3804.0 --> 3810.0
all right and then it's like oh but why

3806.64 --> 3812.52
wouldn't then down here why wouldn't you

3810.0 --> 3814.2
see the reflection of Earth up there if

3812.52 --> 3816.18
it were a mirror

3814.2 --> 3818.66
well maybe because it's literally too

3816.18 --> 3818.66
far away

3828.0 --> 3833.099
but I mean it's probably not gonna be a

3830.88 --> 3835.799
mirror because even then with I imagine

3833.099 --> 3837.3590000000004
that with high altitude balloons

3835.799 --> 3839.28
it would

3837.359 --> 3843.92
probably

3839.28 --> 3843.92
not be too super far away from it

3844.44 --> 3850.079
while still Miles and Miles maybe even

3847.5 --> 3851.819
like hundreds I don't know but

3850.079 --> 3853.799
it would be

3851.819 --> 3855.42
you would probably start to see

3853.799 --> 3859.319
reflection

3855.42 --> 3861.78
at some point some distance

3859.319 --> 3864.359
if it were reflective so maybe it is

3861.78 --> 3867.3590000000004
just a velvet black

3864.359 --> 3869.88
nothing

3867.359 --> 3873.18
you wouldn't even hear it because that

3869.88 --> 3877.26
would mean it's something vibrating

3873.18 --> 3877.2599999999998
it's just nothing poof

3881.04 --> 3885.72
the only sound would come from the

3883.38 --> 3888.0
vibrating object that you would hit

3885.72 --> 3889.98
against the non-space

3888.0 --> 3891.599
the noun space itself is not going to

3889.98 --> 3893.64
vibrate to make sound

3891.599 --> 3897.0
nor is it gonna

3893.64 --> 3899.64
like be able to shift in order to create

3897.0 --> 3902.18
sound vibrations in any air that's right

3899.64 --> 3902.18
next to it

3902.24 --> 3908.24
because it's nothing it's not nothing

3905.16 --> 3908.24
can't vibrate

3917.28 --> 3919.88
right

3926.7 --> 3932.1189999999997
the [ __ ] Mark I don't know what the hell

3929.28 --> 3932.119
you're talking about

3939.78 --> 3947.4
what the [ __ ] anybody can anybody in

3943.619 --> 3949.94
chat please explain to me what the [ __ ]

3947.4 --> 3953.94
Mark nostrils is talking about

3949.94 --> 3954.9
please can somebody please explain it to

3953.94 --> 3957.359
me

3954.9 --> 3959.76
because I don't understand what the hell

3957.359 --> 3963.2
he's talking about

3959.76 --> 3963.2000000000003
it just seems psychotic

3967.02 --> 3971.48
stupid mirror on the wall I just don't

3969.059 --> 3971.48
get it

4001.579 --> 4008.44
there is a nursery rhyme yeah I know

4004.16 --> 4008.44
there is a nursery rhyme goody

4008.66 --> 4011.2599999999998
okay

4011.299 --> 4015.579
I get it there's a nursery rhyme yeah

4017.839 --> 4020.74
what

4021.5 --> 4028.039
what's that necessary to like spend

4025.579 --> 4031.039
like 10 minutes

4028.039 --> 4034.46
laying that out it just seems so weird

4031.039 --> 4034.46
man uh

4037.02 --> 4040.139
[Music]

4043.52 --> 4049.4
trying to waste my time well it seems

4045.559 --> 4049.4
like it yeah anyway

4060.2 --> 4064.0
what the hell are you two talking about

4069.28 --> 4074.26
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed the show

4071.78 --> 4074.26
so far

4078.2 --> 4083.0
if you do then don't forget to rogans it

4080.66 --> 4084.799
up ahead of time I'd prefer if you did

4083.0 --> 4087.559
that ahead of time because a lot of

4084.799 --> 4089.5389999999998
people seem to forget

4087.559 --> 4091.8190000000004
are they

4089.539 --> 4093.079
stop watching the show before it's

4091.819 --> 4096.16
ending

4093.079 --> 4096.16
and then they forget

4096.859 --> 4101.859
so I'd really appreciate it if you Rogan

4099.44 --> 4101.8589999999995
it up

4104.239 --> 4107.5599999999995
and share the show

4129.5 --> 4136.9
yeah okay Mark that sounds all really

4132.38 --> 4136.900000000001
dark and I completely disagree

4138.5 --> 4143.42
although I don't even know this Mirror

4140.96 --> 4145.96
Mirror thing nursery rhyme I've never

4143.42 --> 4145.96
heard that

4150.259 --> 4155.54
first game am I complete guys am I

4153.859 --> 4156.56
complaining that I have nothing to talk

4155.54 --> 4158.7789999999995
about

4156.56 --> 4160.339000000001
am I complaining I have nothing to talk

4158.779 --> 4162.4400000000005
about guys

4160.339 --> 4166.239
when's the last time I've complained

4162.44 --> 4166.239
that I have had nothing to talk about

4167.06 --> 4171.1990000000005
I don't complain I have nothing to talk

4169.04 --> 4172.58
about I found I'll find something to

4171.199 --> 4175.8189999999995
talk about okay

4172.58 --> 4179.12
my problem is is that other people not

4175.819 --> 4181.52
saying anything at all

4179.12 --> 4183.08
for like 12 minutes straight that's my

4181.52 --> 4184.759
problem it's not that I don't have

4183.08 --> 4186.5599999999995
anything to talk about that's not my

4184.759 --> 4187.4
problem I'll find something to talk

4186.56 --> 4188.900000000001
about

4187.4 --> 4191.54
okay

4188.9 --> 4193.639999999999
my problem is that nobody says anything

4191.54 --> 4195.0199999999995
for 12 minutes straight that's the

4193.64 --> 4197.0
problem

4195.02 --> 4199.120000000001
not that I don't have anything to talk

4197.0 --> 4199.12
about

4201.26 --> 4207.7390000000005
and ooh nursery rhymes secretly being

4204.14 --> 4211.88
satanic pre-programming [ __ ] yeah that's

4207.739 --> 4215.259999999999
not I don't care about that sort of [ __ ]

4211.88 --> 4217.46
like if that's a problem

4215.26 --> 4221.3
Solutions yeah

4217.46 --> 4224.12
don't use the nursery rhyme then make

4221.3 --> 4226.46
your own nursery rhyme then

4224.12 --> 4228.92
solved

4226.46 --> 4231.679
no need to squirt

4228.92 --> 4234.7390000000005
over all there's some song out there

4231.679 --> 4237.679
it's like oh Madonna is really evil

4234.739 --> 4241.218999999999
their music is so evil yeah yeah hey

4237.679 --> 4242.96
don't listen to it then

4241.219 --> 4246.26
duh

4242.96 --> 4248.12
yeah you know need the squirt over the

4246.26 --> 4250.280000000001
evil people out there

4248.12 --> 4253.599999999999
yeah

4250.28 --> 4253.599999999999
it's kind of useless

4255.38 --> 4260.06
if you identify some nursery rhyme and

4258.08 --> 4264.32
it's really evil according to you well

4260.06 --> 4268.42
guess what don't use it then

4264.32 --> 4268.42
I mean how hard can this be

4276.92 --> 4281.26
yeah I don't think so I think that

4283.219 --> 4286.82
some of these nursery rhymes they're

4285.32 --> 4290.799999999999
meaningless

4286.82 --> 4290.799999999999
they're they are kind of meaningless

4293.9 --> 4297.62
now maybe you could say oh

4295.34 --> 4299.2390000000005
meaninglessness in a way it's attending

4297.62 --> 4302.0599999999995
because if it doesn't mean anything then

4299.239 --> 4305.959999999999
you're programming them with nothing or

4302.06 --> 4308.679
no I don't know it's pointless

4305.96 --> 4308.679
I mean

4311.36 --> 4317.239
what's the problem

4313.88 --> 4320.78
when nursery rhymes

4317.239 --> 4323.0599999999995
I mean yeah okay if there's some

4320.78 --> 4325.639999999999
person that takes care of your kids or

4323.06 --> 4328.52
something and they have weird nursery

4325.64 --> 4331.6990000000005
rhymes or something yeah I'd be a little

4328.52 --> 4334.580000000001
like uh maybe maybe we should get

4331.699 --> 4336.5
another babysitter

4334.58 --> 4339.5599999999995
or something right

4336.5 --> 4342.739
but I mean this is not an issue

4339.56 --> 4344.900000000001
what the hell is the problem

4342.739 --> 4349.0599999999995
what happened nobody was saying yeah

4344.9 --> 4354.699
yeah I know that Mark no smiles

4349.06 --> 4354.6990000000005
I literally just said that

4365.9 --> 4371.739
I don't care

4368.54 --> 4371.739
I don't care dude

4376.46 --> 4380.9
I'm not digging for evil I'm digging for

4379.82 --> 4383.239
good

4380.9 --> 4385.78
yeah I don't need to dig up all this

4383.239 --> 4385.78
evil

4389.5 --> 4395.96
I don't do that anymore

4392.239 --> 4397.459999999999
it was bad it was interesting perhaps

4395.96 --> 4399.92
but

4397.46 --> 4402.8
it was not durable

4399.92 --> 4405.56
so I prefer to dig to good things I

4402.8 --> 4409.1
prefer to actually dig for truth not

4405.56 --> 4411.679
just all the evils everywhere oh no go

4409.1 --> 4413.6
[ __ ] yourself with your obsession of

4411.679 --> 4415.1
Darkness yeah your obsession of darkness

4413.6 --> 4417.5
is making you

4415.1 --> 4419.84
not appreciate the light you're just

4417.5 --> 4422.239
obsessing over Darkness

4419.84 --> 4424.34
secretly you want to be that

4422.239 --> 4428.0
because that's usually what's actually

4424.34 --> 4430.400000000001
behind that obsession over darkness is

4428.0 --> 4432.86
that you actually want to be that

4430.4 --> 4436.96
huh huh

4432.86 --> 4442.94
yeah I don't I like to know

4436.96 --> 4445.04
interesting unique things and achieve

4442.94 --> 4448.5199999999995
drain of thinking that other people

4445.04 --> 4451.12
simply never got to

4448.52 --> 4451.120000000001
yeah

4451.4 --> 4458.36
digging for the light and the truth

4454.94 --> 4461.78
and complicated ideas

4458.36 --> 4464.12
not just digging for the trash I mean

4461.78 --> 4465.679
yeah there's trash I know there's a lot

4464.12 --> 4468.14
of evil

4465.679 --> 4469.1
do I need to keep digging that up all

4468.14 --> 4472.64
day

4469.1 --> 4476.860000000001
what the hell am I doing then

4472.64 --> 4476.860000000001
just focusing on evil is not good

4479.5 --> 4485.42
just identify it and

4482.659 --> 4488.659
don't take the ticket

4485.42 --> 4491.659
don't do it anymore then

4488.659 --> 4494.08
and move on don't obsess over the

4491.659 --> 4494.08
darkness

4494.12 --> 4497.62
where do you think that's going to lead

4495.38 --> 4497.62
to

4498.44 --> 4502.699
give you a hint it's going to be you

4500.239 --> 4504.799999999999
being miserable

4502.699 --> 4507.94
and isolated

4504.8 --> 4507.9400000000005
and paranoid

4513.86 --> 4521.08
and not very likable

4516.5 --> 4521.08
so I'm not doing that Mark

4528.34 --> 4536.0

4532.46 --> 4540.14
will you please tear it

4536.0 --> 4542.659
stop attacking the people in my chat you

4540.14 --> 4544.820000000001
keep doing this

4542.659 --> 4548.0599999999995
stop doing that

4544.82 --> 4549.44
staz is not going to turn into a flat

4548.06 --> 4552.14
earther okay

4549.44 --> 4553.639999999999
stop trying to force people to do that

4552.14 --> 4555.62
[ __ ]

4553.64 --> 4557.659000000001
it's annoying

4555.62 --> 4561.5199999999995
it's not productive you're just

4557.659 --> 4561.5199999999995
harassing them stop it

4568.4 --> 4571.4
just

4573.04 --> 4578.36
minority for yeah but that's nonsense by

4575.719 --> 4580.46
the way status Moretz I have to give it

4578.36 --> 4582.92
to you that they're testers but I mean

4580.46 --> 4585.62
you always poke everybody in my chat

4582.92 --> 4588.9400000000005
every time just don't do that

4585.62 --> 4588.94
just leave him be

4589.219 --> 4595.88
right but yeah I mean Flat Earth is not

4592.28 --> 4598.82
a minority anymore stats

4595.88 --> 4602.12
I mean people are not publicly

4598.82 --> 4605.0599999999995
like oh we're all about Flat Earth now

4602.12 --> 4606.86
but I mean it's not a minority at all

4605.06 --> 4608.900000000001
I think actually it's kind of the

4606.86 --> 4611.9
opposite I think that the real ball

4608.9 --> 4614.299999999999
Believers are becoming a minority it's

4611.9 --> 4615.799999999999
still reinforced because it's the state

4614.3 --> 4618.1990000000005
religion

4615.8 --> 4620.84
but I don't think there's that many real

4618.199 --> 4623.299999999999
Believers anymore

4620.84 --> 4626.78
I really don't

4623.3 --> 4629.5
I don't think we are a minority flat

4626.78 --> 4632.84
earthers I think that majority actually

4629.5 --> 4635.62
is figuring out that it's not that ball

4632.84 --> 4635.62
in outer space

4638.06 --> 4643.46
all right but what do you do you don't

4640.04 --> 4645.739
then oh I'm a flat earther I have a

4643.46 --> 4647.84
flatter t-shirt I will talk only about

4645.739 --> 4649.699
flatter then I will have banners with

4647.84 --> 4652.88
flat Earth and walk around every day

4649.699 --> 4654.199
it'll flatter flat no no people don't do

4652.88 --> 4658.04
that

4654.199 --> 4659.719
they just like oh it was a lie well that

4658.04 --> 4662.0
sucks

4659.719 --> 4665.36
okay we'll move on

4662.0 --> 4668.44
just no it's a lie now yeah that's what

4665.36 --> 4668.44
people actually do

4672.56 --> 4678.76
it's not a minority

4674.659 --> 4678.759999999999
Flat Earth isn't a minority anymore

4692.3 --> 4698.54
you have a turret you are over

4695.239 --> 4703.239
generalizing yeah stats Moretz isn't

4698.54 --> 4703.239
watching every show he just came back

4705.739 --> 4712.28
and overall the amount of time he spent

4709.04 --> 4716.6
here is like

4712.28 --> 4719.179
like months at best he hasn't caught all

4716.6 --> 4722.360000000001
the information so you're over gen

4719.179 --> 4725.12
you're just treating him like he is

4722.36 --> 4727.82
a fragment of all the Ballers with all

4725.12 --> 4729.38
the Ballers knowledge and all the

4727.82 --> 4731.42
knowledge about having seen my show

4729.38 --> 4734.02
that's not the case he's a relatively

4731.42 --> 4734.02
new guy

4734.659 --> 4738.92
he's not denying

4737.179 --> 4741.4
he just doesn't know

4738.92 --> 4741.4
yet

4754.82 --> 4759.92
still

4756.86 --> 4762.5
hey dude parrot that's their freaking

4759.92 --> 4765.5
problem man it's called hypnosis it's

4762.5 --> 4767.96
called Satan's touch

4765.5 --> 4770.06
you want to believe in that you're gonna

4767.96 --> 4772.52
go with that well that's cool you go and

4770.06 --> 4773.6
do that and you're probably gonna die

4772.52 --> 4776.2390000000005
then

4773.6 --> 4779.1990000000005
your [ __ ] problem

4776.239 --> 4779.199
not mine

4781.94 --> 4786.08
I mean if you're that stupid that you

4784.04 --> 4788.6
can't even see through that after all

4786.08 --> 4790.5199999999995
this then you're probably not gonna be

4788.6 --> 4793.9400000000005
an overall very productive and

4790.52 --> 4796.64
functional person in society anyway is

4793.94 --> 4799.04
my estimation

4796.64 --> 4800.780000000001
and you're probably gonna be damaging

4799.04 --> 4802.82
other people around you with your

4800.78 --> 4804.5599999999995
delusions as well dragging them along

4802.82 --> 4806.199
with you

4804.56 --> 4809.659000000001
so

4806.199 --> 4812.839999999999
I'd say let them die

4809.659 --> 4815.239
just who gives a [ __ ] if they believe in

4812.84 --> 4816.52
the sea situation

4815.239 --> 4818.718999999999
they're gonna take medical

4816.52 --> 4821.4400000000005
experimentations it's their freaking

4818.719 --> 4821.44
problem now

4826.14 --> 4830.179
[Music]

4828.14 --> 4832.04
the Ballers who come well who are you

4830.179 --> 4835.159
talking to then Tarot

4832.04 --> 4837.26
because you seem to be talking to stez

4835.159 --> 4840.28
but now you're talking to people who

4837.26 --> 4840.280000000001
aren't even in the chat

4846.699 --> 4851.719
to raise the standard no

4849.92 --> 4854.5
no the standard here in this show is

4851.719 --> 4854.5
pretty damn High

4876.26 --> 4879.789000000001
[Music]

4888.739 --> 4893.299999999999
how much time

4890.48 --> 4896.0
no not with turret

4893.3 --> 4899.78
there will be people that will never

4896.0 --> 4901.4
give up on it do you understand

4899.78 --> 4904.699
just like

4901.4 --> 4906.86
there would be people in the 80s that

4904.699 --> 4908.659
would still think

4906.86 --> 4912.259999999999
that

4908.659 --> 4914.54
the the stuff in World War II

4912.26 --> 4917.780000000001
that that they were on the right side

4914.54 --> 4919.699
right I mean people don't give up on

4917.78 --> 4921.86
stupid things that are proven to be

4919.699 --> 4925.339999999999
false people don't give up on that

4921.86 --> 4927.259999999999
they've gone in they've lost things and

4925.34 --> 4929.78
now they cannot

4927.26 --> 4931.9400000000005
turn it off they just believe and

4929.78 --> 4935.08
they're gonna believe until they die and

4931.94 --> 4935.08
they probably will

4935.42 --> 4940.9400000000005
they got touched by Satan they believed

4939.02 --> 4942.7390000000005
something that was wrong and then they

4940.94 --> 4945.62
couldn't let it go anymore and that it's

4942.739 --> 4947.659
gonna kill them yeah ignorance is bliss

4945.62 --> 4949.699
until you die

4947.659 --> 4953.36
that's how it happens it's nothing you

4949.699 --> 4955.159
could do about that sure some people you

4953.36 --> 4957.86
might they might figure it out if you

4955.159 --> 4959.96
just quickly tell them or whatever

4957.86 --> 4962.78
but if they don't and they're resisting

4959.96 --> 4964.76
you it doesn't help you if you're gonna

4962.78 --> 4967.28
just keep doing that

4964.76 --> 4971.42
over and over and over again they're not

4967.28 --> 4971.42
going to let go then

4972.76 --> 4976.079000000001
[Music]

4979.76 --> 4986.38
what's right they lie no no no Derek

4983.36 --> 4986.38
they believe

4986.42 --> 4991.1
if they're lying

4988.34 --> 4993.4400000000005
if they like knew that they were lying I

4991.1 --> 4995.42
can sense that I have an actual better

4993.44 --> 4997.58
sense for that

4995.42 --> 4999.56
unless I'm really pissed off and then I

4997.58 --> 5001.96
then I do get a little paranoid like

4999.56 --> 5003.280000000001
that I can't sense it as well but when

5001.96 --> 5006.4
I'm not

5003.28 --> 5009.34
I can sense that

5006.4 --> 5011.58
people don't lie as often as you might

5009.34 --> 5011.58
think

5011.62 --> 5016.36
most people are just ignorant they just

5014.08 --> 5017.38
say things that they think or believe in

5016.36 --> 5019.78
the moment

5017.38 --> 5021.82
even if they've known better they might

5019.78 --> 5024.94
have just forgotten

5021.82 --> 5027.46
okay people unfortunately are just not

5024.94 --> 5028.419999999999
that intellectually disciplined on

5027.46 --> 5030.34
average

5028.42 --> 5033.34
it's very disappointing I know but

5030.34 --> 5035.14
that's just how people work

5033.34 --> 5036.9400000000005
okay

5035.14 --> 5038.679
they're not

5036.94 --> 5040.12
geniuses

5038.679 --> 5042.219
even though they might think they're

5040.12 --> 5045.46
Geniuses they're not

5042.219 --> 5049.12
because they easily forget things and

5045.46 --> 5050.8
didn't get things and then they just

5049.12 --> 5054.4
start repeating the same thing over

5050.8 --> 5058.12
again because they're stupid yeah don't

5054.4 --> 5060.879999999999
attribute malice to what is more likely

5058.12 --> 5065.739
just stupidity

5060.88 --> 5068.1990000000005
and stupidity has really no limits in

5065.739 --> 5070.12
how stupid somebody can be which is

5068.199 --> 5073.839999999999
extremely frustrating to somebody that's

5070.12 --> 5076.719
not stupid and trying to not be stupid

5073.84 --> 5079.6
and just become surreal how stupid

5076.719 --> 5081.52
somebody some people can get and then

5079.6 --> 5083.4400000000005
you will attribute it to malice because

5081.52 --> 5086.8
you just cannot believe that somebody

5083.44 --> 5090.699
can be that [ __ ] stupid well Welcome

5086.8 --> 5092.1
to the Real World they can they can be

5090.699 --> 5096.04
that stupid

5092.1 --> 5099.64
unlimited stupidity yeah not malice

5096.04 --> 5101.56
unlimited stupidity yes it's possible

5099.64 --> 5103.659000000001
and it doesn't matter that they can

5101.56 --> 5106.54
Google things you can show it right in

5103.659 --> 5109.0599999999995
their face you can tattoo it

5106.54 --> 5112.0
on their face if you want and they'll

5109.06 --> 5116.080000000001
still not get it because it's blocked

5112.0 --> 5120.219
it will not submit

5116.08 --> 5123.5199999999995
not malice like unlimited stupidity

5120.219 --> 5125.32
will not submit no matter what you'd

5123.52 --> 5127.4800000000005
have to kill it and it still wouldn't

5125.32 --> 5130.78
submit people will get so stupid and

5127.48 --> 5135.159
stubborn they'll literally die for their

5130.78 --> 5137.679
idiocy okay turret that's reality people

5135.159 --> 5140.739
or can get stupid enough that they'll

5137.679 --> 5144.159
die for their idiocy

5140.739 --> 5145.239
you just have to concede that that's how

5144.159 --> 5147.96
things work

5145.239 --> 5147.959999999999
out there

5149.679 --> 5154.12
doesn't matter if you can look up the

5151.6 --> 5156.88
right answer some people can't they

5154.12 --> 5159.88
can't look up the right answer and they

5156.88 --> 5162.34
can't read the right answer when it's

5159.88 --> 5163.719
literally staring in the face

5162.34 --> 5166.5
it's not

5163.719 --> 5166.5
that they

5166.54 --> 5171.04
that they know it that they read and

5168.58 --> 5174.6
ignore it no they can't read it they

5171.04 --> 5179.639
read it and the letters just go

5174.6 --> 5185.620000000001
they can't read it it's blocked

5179.639 --> 5185.62
idiocy Knows No Limit Tarot

5187.12 --> 5190.3
[Music]

5194.08 --> 5197.26
[Music]

5202.6 --> 5208.4800000000005
but if you no I'd never what no I don't

5206.08 --> 5210.82
know why I said it it was an over

5208.48 --> 5213.5199999999995
exaggeration fuzzy

5210.82 --> 5216.159
a tattoo information on somebody's face

5213.52 --> 5218.139
yeah I know it sounded a little silly

5216.159 --> 5220.839999999999
it's just

5218.139 --> 5223.86
a manner of speaking like nobody's like

5220.84 --> 5223.860000000001
what the [ __ ] the point

5224.98 --> 5229.239
although I mean there are some people

5226.96 --> 5231.52
that actually sort of do that

5229.239 --> 5233.32
I get tattoos all over their face I

5231.52 --> 5236.1990000000005
don't know why people would do that my

5233.32 --> 5237.94
point is that no matter how extreme the

5236.199 --> 5240.299999999999
confrontation is with the information

5237.94 --> 5243.46
sometimes the information literally

5240.3 --> 5246.219
cannot enter they'll try to read it

5243.46 --> 5249.28
their eyes will start to misfunction

5246.219 --> 5251.139
they will get tired all of a sudden then

5249.28 --> 5254.199
when they read it's like the letters go

5251.139 --> 5258.58
blue and they get really agitated they

5254.199 --> 5262.599999999999
get emotion like no they can not

5258.58 --> 5265.42
read it you understand tariff

5262.6 --> 5268.0
it's not even about being stupid it's

5265.42 --> 5269.32
about a block there's a block

5268.0 --> 5272.56
it's

5269.32 --> 5274.36
a spirit thing it's blocked it's a

5272.56 --> 5277.900000000001
disabling them

5274.36 --> 5280.0599999999995
from being able to assimilate the

5277.9 --> 5283.08
information

5280.06 --> 5283.080000000001
they're blocked

5283.179 --> 5287.679
but it does definitely fall under

5285.699 --> 5290.32
stupidity because it's basically their

5287.679 --> 5293.92
inner mechanics completely working

5290.32 --> 5296.5
against themselves that is stupidity if

5293.92 --> 5298.54
you have a demon inside of you that

5296.5 --> 5300.219
literally prevents you

5298.54 --> 5305.0199999999995
from moving on

5300.219 --> 5308.02
that is idiocy in that sense I am an

5305.02 --> 5310.659000000001
idiot too because I have those types of

5308.02 --> 5312.9400000000005
things that's why I know how to describe

5310.659 --> 5316.12
it so well because I [ __ ] struggle

5312.94 --> 5319.78
with that [ __ ] I've been an absolute

5316.12 --> 5320.88
like mind-blowing [ __ ] when I was

5319.78 --> 5324.759999999999
younger

5320.88 --> 5327.639
mind-blowingly stubborn [ __ ] I hate

5324.76 --> 5328.26
myself for that

5327.639 --> 5329.92
okay

5328.26 --> 5333.76
[Music]

5329.92 --> 5339.12
it's not because I'm uh I don't get it

5333.76 --> 5339.12
no it's because I couldn't get it

5341.26 --> 5347.02
I would not allow myself to get it

5345.4 --> 5348.58
because there was something in my

5347.02 --> 5351.46
subconscious

5348.58 --> 5353.5
it's just like no

5351.46 --> 5357.699
just know

5353.5 --> 5360.4
doesn't matter what you think just know

5357.699 --> 5362.0199999999995
it felt like moral impulses a lot of

5360.4 --> 5364.48
that and for these people

5362.02 --> 5366.88
often they've entangled moral

5364.48 --> 5369.718999999999
understanding to these types of impulses

5366.88 --> 5373.78
so there's literally globers out there

5369.719 --> 5376.0
that just cannot read into something

5373.78 --> 5379.599999999999
that would prove the globe to be

5376.0 --> 5382.6
actually wrong cognitively

5379.6 --> 5385.659000000001
because that would be immoral to them

5382.6 --> 5389.679
right it impulse they feel like this is

5385.659 --> 5392.739
evil I cannot guess it's like oh I must

5389.679 --> 5395.38
defy the Satan I'm reading it but I

5392.739 --> 5398.62
can't read it it's evil right they might

5395.38 --> 5400.54
not think that cognitively but it'll

5398.62 --> 5402.219
kind of feel like that

5400.54 --> 5405.82
you know why

5402.219 --> 5406.96
because the globe is a religion

5405.82 --> 5410.92
yeah

5406.96 --> 5412.179
it's the same thing there's a morality

5410.92 --> 5414.58
about

5412.179 --> 5418.38
going about with the globe they have

5414.58 --> 5418.38
their own moral code

5420.34 --> 5425.62
of what to do what not to do what to

5423.34 --> 5428.26
accept and what to ignore

5425.62 --> 5431.5
it's not really spoken out its

5428.26 --> 5433.84
subconscious but it works the same

5431.5 --> 5437.34
it's a natural position your

5433.84 --> 5437.34
subconscious takes

5437.5 --> 5445.79
when you accept the globe faith

5441.82 --> 5448.92
and that happens usually very young

5445.79 --> 5448.92
[Music]

5459.0 --> 5462.25
[Music]

5474.219 --> 5477.78
man let's get it cold

5480.78 --> 5484.92
it's cold as [ __ ]

5488.4 --> 5491.969999999999
[Music]

5492.04 --> 5495.94
ah

5494.62 --> 5498.159
[Music]

5495.94 --> 5501.9
competitors was the biggest Sean

5498.159 --> 5501.9
worshiper wasidao I mean

5503.02 --> 5509.88
I kind of worshiped the sun I just don't

5505.54 --> 5509.88
think he's God it's not God

5510.04 --> 5515.26
but I mean I freaking love the Sun and

5512.44 --> 5517.799999999999
it's like changes everything every time

5515.26 --> 5517.8
it's there

5524.26 --> 5529.12
but I mean is that what is worshiping is

5527.139 --> 5532.3
worshiping believing something is the

5529.12 --> 5536.58
creator is that worshiping

5532.3 --> 5536.58
or is it just loving something a lot

5539.44 --> 5544.178999999999
which one is it is worshiping something

5541.719 --> 5548.88
believing it is the creator

5544.179 --> 5548.88
or is it just loving something so much

5548.92 --> 5552.4800000000005
that you don't want to live without it

5552.94 --> 5555.839999999999
which one is it

5568.659 --> 5575.679
shape Planet yeah but fuzzy I mean

5572.44 --> 5577.48
there's a logical reasons why people do

5575.679 --> 5579.219
get obsessed over it and that's because

5577.48 --> 5580.419999999999
of all the implications that are all

5579.219 --> 5582.46
hung up

5580.42 --> 5585.04
on that scenario of the Earth being

5582.46 --> 5586.9
Globe you see it's the world religion

5585.04 --> 5590.38
if the Earth wasn't a globe that would

5586.9 --> 5592.96
mean that it would all be a lie and that

5590.38 --> 5594.219
people are either lying or completely

5592.96 --> 5596.159
[ __ ]

5594.219 --> 5599.8
it's a massive

5596.159 --> 5602.739
confrontation of disappointment with

5599.8 --> 5604.84
reality itself fuzzy

5602.739 --> 5609.718999999999
so yeah

5604.84 --> 5609.719
of course they'll get demonic about it

5610.9 --> 5613.379999999999
because

5613.719 --> 5618.94
if the Earth was in the globe then the

5616.179 --> 5623.28
entire wolves totally [ __ ] up

5618.94 --> 5623.28
and people are the worst and Evil

5623.98 --> 5630.879999999999
like Beyond just patronizing oh you

5627.58 --> 5633.34
stupid IPS evolved into humans now not

5630.88 --> 5636.52
that not not like that

5633.34 --> 5639.159000000001
that would seem pale in comparison to

5636.52 --> 5642.4800000000005
the actual reality of understanding how

5639.159 --> 5642.48
[ __ ] up people are

5642.659 --> 5648.12
that the entire mental world is turned

5646.36 --> 5650.739
inside out

5648.12 --> 5655.44
systematically and people are getting

5650.739 --> 5655.44
spiritually mentally exploited

5656.92 --> 5663.52
by things that before that you thought

5660.46 --> 5665.32
were good and normal yeah that's the

5663.52 --> 5667.179
shock finding out that all those things

5665.32 --> 5669.0
you just take for granted oh that's yeah

5667.179 --> 5673.0
that's how they do it that it's actually

5669.0 --> 5676.0
really bad you know how horrific it is

5673.0 --> 5678.219
to suddenly have your Shield drop and

5676.0 --> 5681.4
figure out that you've been living in

5678.219 --> 5684.52
hell all your life you know how painful

5681.4 --> 5687.759999999999
that is Tara

5684.52 --> 5689.679
fuzzy right

5687.76 --> 5693.88
no wonder

5689.679 --> 5696.88
no wonder they like fight fight to the

5693.88 --> 5699.159000000001
the dying of the light you can't submit

5696.88 --> 5702.719
to the realization that you've been

5699.159 --> 5702.719
living in hell all this time

5703.179 --> 5707.4
of course you're gonna fight like crazy

5707.44 --> 5711.82
at first

5708.82 --> 5713.86
I mean you do eventually wake up

5711.82 --> 5717.099999999999
one way or the other to how [ __ ] up

5713.86 --> 5720.42
people can be around you how treacherous

5717.1 --> 5724.780000000001
and how superficial and just

5720.42 --> 5727.42
unnecessarily dark and how easily

5724.78 --> 5730.42
corruptable so you'll find out how evil

5727.42 --> 5733.0
humanity is indirectly

5730.42 --> 5735.46
or directly in a direct sense anyway

5733.0 --> 5737.08
eventually

5735.46 --> 5739.0
but when you're really young you don't

5737.08 --> 5741.5199999999995
have all that experience to basically

5739.0 --> 5743.679
prove to you how [ __ ] up it is and so

5741.52 --> 5746.4400000000005
then if you hear

5743.679 --> 5748.659
it was all a lie it's not a globe there

5746.44 --> 5750.699
have been systematically lying for

5748.659 --> 5751.96
multiple generations and they're

5750.699 --> 5753.219
literally

5751.96 --> 5756.28
like

5753.219 --> 5758.679
drag the program morality out of you and

5756.28 --> 5760.12
make you think that abandoning old

5758.679 --> 5762.88
morale

5760.12 --> 5764.8
old habits is a good thing and

5762.88 --> 5766.2390000000005
Progressive turning everything inside

5764.8 --> 5769.42
out

5766.239 --> 5772.54
if you just all of a sudden

5769.42 --> 5776.56
just it switches inside out then it's

5772.54 --> 5780.82
literally like you just figured out I've

5776.56 --> 5784.0
died actually I wasn't born I died

5780.82 --> 5787.42
and then woke up in hell and that's been

5784.0 --> 5789.639
my life that's what that feels like is

5787.42 --> 5791.9800000000005
what it felt like to me

5789.639 --> 5793.54
when I was young and facing Flat Earth

5791.98 --> 5795.94
okay

5793.54 --> 5798.4
to me

5795.94 --> 5801.94
so I can attest

5798.4 --> 5803.5599999999995
I can testify my own experience of going

5801.94 --> 5807.219
through that

5803.56 --> 5810.639
how incredibly shocking and jarring that

5807.219 --> 5812.92
is I mean over at Flat Earth debates the

5810.639 --> 5815.139
guys sometimes talk about it but still

5812.92 --> 5818.9800000000005
from a pretty comfortable position or I

5815.139 --> 5821.6990000000005
can tell you they under

5818.98 --> 5821.699
play it

5822.1 --> 5827.1990000000005
it should not be underestimated how

5825.1 --> 5829.780000000001
impactful that can be especially to

5827.199 --> 5832.239
young people that are really into it and

5829.78 --> 5834.639
then they realize how incredibly [ __ ]

5832.239 --> 5836.759999999999
up everything really is

5834.639 --> 5839.4400000000005
now these days I guess that

5836.76 --> 5842.8
circumstances have changed dramatically

5839.44 --> 5846.58
I mean when I grew up I wasn't subjected

5842.8 --> 5850.4800000000005
as much to propaganda compared to now I

5846.58 --> 5852.5199999999995
wasn't facing SGA W's as much

5850.48 --> 5856.0
I wasn't facing

5852.52 --> 5858.52
trans [ __ ] especially trans children

5856.0 --> 5860.8
that wasn't all there so the world kind

5858.52 --> 5863.080000000001
of still seems somewhat normal now

5860.8 --> 5865.179
however with all those [ __ ] up things

5863.08 --> 5867.46
out there already people are going to be

5865.179 --> 5870.4
locked into them and it's gonna be hell

5867.46 --> 5872.44
for them no matter what might seem to

5870.4 --> 5874.36
them that it's all real fun then they

5872.44 --> 5876.219
grow up and then it's completely [ __ ]

5874.36 --> 5877.9
like those people who don't give a [ __ ]

5876.219 --> 5879.3
about Flat Earth or the globe or even

5877.9 --> 5881.86
whether

5879.3 --> 5884.08
whether they are in Hell or not they're

5881.86 --> 5886.0
just escaping in their weird little

5884.08 --> 5888.04
choice that they lock themselves into

5886.0 --> 5890.44
and that's going to be their problem now

5888.04 --> 5891.699
the rest of their lives

5890.44 --> 5894.339999999999
right

5891.699 --> 5896.5
so that does make it a little easier to

5894.34 --> 5898.54
already realize when you're young now in

5896.5 --> 5900.78
this period of time

5898.54 --> 5903.04
to see like yeah well

5900.78 --> 5905.259999999999
everybody's so [ __ ] up there's so many

5903.04 --> 5907.36
[ __ ] up things rolling out

5905.26 --> 5909.76
yeah I mean

5907.36 --> 5911.92
why wouldn't the Earth be flat you know

5909.76 --> 5915.1
everything else that they've said is

5911.92 --> 5918.28
complete hogwash [ __ ] and blatant

5915.1 --> 5920.679
lie and miserable and demonic so why

5918.28 --> 5923.38
wouldn't the Earth be flat well my

5920.679 --> 5925.78
generation probably doesn't feel like

5923.38 --> 5927.9400000000005
that because we didn't grow up in a

5925.78 --> 5929.44
world that was like savagely [ __ ] up

5927.94 --> 5931.719
like that

5929.44 --> 5934.54
they were [ __ ] up things and there

5931.719 --> 5937.06
were lies and propaganda and the the

5934.54 --> 5939.5199999999995
arrival of global warming nonsense and

5937.06 --> 5940.360000000001
all that which I did believe in back

5939.52 --> 5941.620000000001
then

5940.36 --> 5943.839999999999
okay

5941.62 --> 5946.0
but now it's become so bad that people

5943.84 --> 5947.9800000000005
either get locked in and they completely

5946.0 --> 5949.42
lose themselves

5947.98 --> 5952.36
they're [ __ ]

5949.42 --> 5954.6
possessed by Satan probably never to

5952.36 --> 5954.599999999999
return

5954.76 --> 5959.92
or they are very much implied like wow

5957.82 --> 5961.78
this is a [ __ ] up world so yeah the

5959.92 --> 5963.96
Earth might just as well be flat they're

5961.78 --> 5966.82
not gonna have as much problems

5963.96 --> 5970.659
as I had

5966.82 --> 5973.299999999999
because the evil wasn't as blatant yet

5970.659 --> 5975.339999999999
when I was still very young

5973.3 --> 5977.38
I mean there was a lot of bad behavior

5975.34 --> 5979.659000000001
in people and people treated me very

5977.38 --> 5983.08
nasty

5979.659 --> 5985.659
but that wasn't the state religion in

5983.08 --> 5987.82
the television they weren't totally

5985.659 --> 5992.28
[ __ ] up yet

5987.82 --> 5992.28
they were just overtly demonic yet

5994.84 --> 5999.82
so

5996.82 --> 6003.12
because of that I think there's a direct

5999.82 --> 6006.84
connection it's like globalism and the

6003.12 --> 6009.48
Demonic Crow Schwab and Hillary Clinton

6006.84 --> 6012.860000000001
and all that [ __ ] and the Dashie W

6009.48 --> 6016.62
nonsense and a woke [ __ ] it's literally

6012.86 --> 6020.099999999999
breaking the spell of the globe

6016.62 --> 6022.0199999999995
it's breaking it because everything's so

6020.1 --> 6024.06
demonic it doesn't matter anymore

6022.02 --> 6026.9400000000005
whether it's a globe or not

6024.06 --> 6028.679
and so it's there's nothing holding you

6026.94 --> 6030.178999999999
back from actually going to Flat Earth

6028.679 --> 6032.4
because hey

6030.179 --> 6034.38
maybe you could use it as a weapon to

6032.4 --> 6036.839999999999
those demons

6034.38 --> 6038.9400000000005
maybe they don't care

6036.84 --> 6040.92
who knows it just doesn't matter anymore

6038.94 --> 6043.678999999999
because everything is demonic so you're

6040.92 --> 6046.26
already waking up out of the illusion

6043.679 --> 6048.179
that the world is inside out in reality

6046.26 --> 6050.159000000001
and that there's a lot of [ __ ] up

6048.179 --> 6053.639
manipulation of people

6050.159 --> 6057.138999999999
it's much easier now to figure that out

6053.639 --> 6057.139
that it was when I was young

6061.56 --> 6067.56
a steamy traveler at the face

6064.8 --> 6071.42
Richard trying not to be dick

6067.56 --> 6071.42
do I think demons are real

6075.179 --> 6079.92
what

6077.28 --> 6082.679
the [ __ ]

6079.92 --> 6085.08
marijuana producer now produce cocaine

6082.679 --> 6087.92
That's crazy dude that's just like the

6085.08 --> 6087.92
South Park episode

6088.62 --> 6093.5599999999995
okay interesting though you know because

6095.04 --> 6100.98
if there might be a good quality control

6098.04 --> 6102.84
look okay look if you Legalize It the

6100.98 --> 6105.299999999999
quality is going to be a lot better it's

6102.84 --> 6107.9400000000005
it might not be such a [ __ ] up drug

6105.3 --> 6111.659000000001
then I couldn't say the same for meth by

6107.94 --> 6114.259999999999
the way that's always [ __ ] up

6111.659 --> 6114.259999999999
but

6115.56 --> 6119.46
yeah I don't know

6117.36 --> 6121.0199999999995
I'm not personally like somebody that

6119.46 --> 6123.119
likes cocaine already I've never

6121.02 --> 6125.580000000001
actually tried it it's just that I've

6123.119 --> 6128.099999999999
never met a person that that I figured

6125.58 --> 6131.04
out took cocaine that I liked I they

6128.1 --> 6132.2390000000005
were all very repulsive people

6131.04 --> 6136.04
so

6132.239 --> 6136.04
I don't think it would work for me

6136.139 --> 6142.7390000000005
but I mean I think that potentially you

6138.78 --> 6145.38
could like take coca leaf extract

6142.739 --> 6149.419999999999
in a really good quality and it could

6145.38 --> 6149.42
probably have medicinal properties

6150.48 --> 6157.259999999999
right the cookie is just like turning it

6153.9 --> 6160.32
into like this concentrated hard drug

6157.26 --> 6162.96
right it's different

6160.32 --> 6164.82
but I mean if there's that's the thing

6162.96 --> 6168.679
you know legalize oh everybody's gonna

6164.82 --> 6168.679
go into drugs well will they

6169.56 --> 6175.56
you know legalization at least creates

6172.86 --> 6178.88
quality control you gotta think of that

6175.56 --> 6178.88
as well right

6179.699 --> 6185.099999999999
and Hey Nobody's forcing you to use

6183.179 --> 6188.159
it's not like there's going to be lines

6185.1 --> 6191.54
of coke lying around everywhere now

6188.159 --> 6191.54
I highly doubt that

6192.6 --> 6197.159000000001
oh so although maybe it'll get crazy I

6195.06 --> 6199.080000000001
mean some of these drug house people

6197.159 --> 6202.259999999999
they'll just like

6199.08 --> 6204.54
start oding on that [ __ ] if it becomes

6202.26 --> 6206.280000000001
legal or good let them

6204.54 --> 6209.84
let them [ __ ] themselves out of

6206.28 --> 6209.84
existence they need to

6218.58 --> 6223.679
but yeah I get that that certainly

6221.76 --> 6228.02
caught your attention it's quite

6223.679 --> 6228.02
something legalization of cocaine

6232.56 --> 6236.580000000001
although I don't understand what that

6234.6 --> 6239.280000000001
has to do with the marijuana produces

6236.58 --> 6241.34
like why would the marijuana producers

6239.28 --> 6245.78
be

6241.34 --> 6245.78
into cocaine that seems weird

6249.659 --> 6254.0
I mean wouldn't they rather be competing

6265.38 --> 6268.38
one

6275.76 --> 6279.84
okay I don't exactly get it but yes

6278.699 --> 6283.678999999999
fuzzy

6279.84 --> 6286.92
cocaine is

6283.679 --> 6291.4800000000005
it lures in very specific really intense

6286.92 --> 6294.3
bad frequencies bad habits ex ego

6291.48 --> 6296.4
extremities right cocaine

6294.3 --> 6299.28
people that are in cocaine are very

6296.4 --> 6304.339999999999
typically egomaniacs

6299.28 --> 6304.34
that are like really egomaniac

6305.4 --> 6310.44
but it may be a bit stereotyping but

6308.04 --> 6313.139
that does happen and it does aggravate

6310.44 --> 6314.879999999999
those traits

6313.139 --> 6317.82
people that use cocaine really think

6314.88 --> 6319.619
they're all bad they really do

6317.82 --> 6322.5
it's part of it

6319.619 --> 6324.54
and so yeah I mean you're gonna be more

6322.5 --> 6327.36
vulnerable to demonic influence but I

6324.54 --> 6330.36
mean I think that cocaine it would be

6327.36 --> 6331.759999999999
less than like with math math is most

6330.36 --> 6335.88
palpable

6331.76 --> 6337.8
demonic Gateway openers there is out

6335.88 --> 6340.56
there

6337.8 --> 6342.719
might also have to do with that it's not

6340.56 --> 6345.56
an organic drug

6342.719 --> 6349.26
yeah cocaine is derived from a plant

6345.56 --> 6353.76
marijuana is a plant

6349.26 --> 6357.54
meth is chemically created in a lab

6353.76 --> 6360.08
it's not surprising to me that it is the

6357.54 --> 6362.82
most demonically

6360.08 --> 6365.58
influenced like that because it is

6362.82 --> 6369.5
there's no plant

6365.58 --> 6369.5
to basically make it natural

6369.84 --> 6375.78
right but I mean yeah I'm not I Don't

6373.08 --> 6378.54
Like Cocaine I mean I might like chew on

6375.78 --> 6381.3
a Coke a coca leaf or something sometime

6378.54 --> 6384.42
that that might be interesting

6381.3 --> 6386.159000000001
but that cocaine is good no but it's

6384.42 --> 6389.6990000000005
yeah but it's still based on the plant

6386.159 --> 6392.28
George Sanford meth is not based on any

6389.699 --> 6393.659
planned component it's all chemistry all

6392.28 --> 6396.84
of it

6393.659 --> 6398.4
there's no plants involved whatsoever

6396.84 --> 6400.4400000000005
with math

6398.4 --> 6402.599999999999
but yes you're right they basically

6400.44 --> 6405.678999999999
concentrated chemically and the same is

6402.6 --> 6405.679
done with Heroin it's

6413.84 --> 6419.52
that's only the way that is genetically

6416.699 --> 6423.259999999999
manipulated in labs and it has to be

6419.52 --> 6423.26
very much marked

6425.0 --> 6431.58
yeah something is genetically modified

6428.159 --> 6434.04
you have to label that you have to say

6431.58 --> 6436.739
that it is

6434.04 --> 6438.9
and yeah there is some genetically

6436.739 --> 6440.638999999999
modified weed especially in the United

6438.9 --> 6444.138999999999
States

6440.639 --> 6444.139
that weed is [ __ ] up

6444.42 --> 6451.679
I do not like that weed at all I think

6447.9 --> 6453.719
that it is really bad it's scary

6451.679 --> 6457.86
what it does

6453.719 --> 6459.42
all we know it isn't at phrase it isn't

6457.86 --> 6460.799999999999
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6459.42 --> 6464.159
talking about

6460.8 --> 6468.360000000001
you're not even a smoker I am

6464.159 --> 6470.58
I should know I smoke I can tell

6468.36 --> 6473.639
if I get some weed out of California

6470.58 --> 6476.699
that's a little extra expensive

6473.639 --> 6480.38
like it immediately like induces like

6476.699 --> 6480.379999999999
nightmarish things and all that

6483.42 --> 6487.56
doesn't yeah

6485.76 --> 6490.679
but I can tell though

6487.56 --> 6493.7390000000005
at Freddy's so you keep on blabber

6490.679 --> 6496.02
mouthing with your paranoid [ __ ]

6493.739 --> 6500.0599999999995
ideas of how it's all modified yeah it

6496.02 --> 6500.06
isn't yeah I would be able to tell

6502.159 --> 6507.48
oh so you oh wow so you're just a

6505.679 --> 6509.88
[ __ ] [ __ ] then

6507.48 --> 6512.04
you're a smoker then

6509.88 --> 6515.119
yet you're telling me it's all

6512.04 --> 6518.46
genetically modified so you are a then

6515.119 --> 6522.659
self-admitted genetically modified

6518.46 --> 6523.86
smoking idiot at face how am I not

6522.659 --> 6525.179
surprised

6523.86 --> 6527.219
yeah

6525.179 --> 6530.82
if something is genetically modified

6527.219 --> 6534.92
cannabis I can tell like within one

6530.82 --> 6538.82
second one second of inhaling that smoke

6534.92 --> 6538.82
one second okay

6541.32 --> 6546.139
my the weed that I get is not

6543.179 --> 6546.139
genetically modified

6547.32 --> 6553.619
and the coffee shop where I go at they

6550.8 --> 6556.139
are very much aware about the concerns

6553.619 --> 6557.82
of that sort of thing

6556.139 --> 6559.7390000000005
there's other coffee shops that just

6557.82 --> 6562.139
don't give a [ __ ] that they throw out

6559.739 --> 6565.0199999999995
whatever man and they get it's more

6562.139 --> 6567.9800000000005
trashy customers right coffee shop I go

6565.02 --> 6570.4800000000005
to no they know what they're doing

6567.98 --> 6572.4
a very good

6570.48 --> 6576.178999999999
uh Growers

6572.4 --> 6579.92
and import of hashes and all that

6576.179 --> 6579.92
it's not genetically modified

6581.34 --> 6588.719
they have some California brands

6585.6 --> 6591.6
right separate that they import yeah

6588.719 --> 6595.02
that's probably genetically modified as

6591.6 --> 6598.139
soon as you like take one little

6595.02 --> 6600.84
Sif of that it's I feel it immediately

6598.139 --> 6605.46
it's immediately a nightmare

6600.84 --> 6606.659000000001
not fun the slide it's just a nightmare

6605.46 --> 6608.82
so

6606.659 --> 6611.839999999999
am I in Europe yes

6608.82 --> 6611.84

6614.219 --> 6618.3

6616.86 --> 6620.04
[ __ ] [ __ ] you don't know what the

6618.3 --> 6623.360000000001
[ __ ] you're talking about so shut the

you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6629.699 --> 6632.178999999999

[ __ ]

6673.52 --> 6681.119000000001

6681.119 --> 6685.339999999999
what the [ __ ] you're talking about yeah

6685.619 --> 6691.32

6691.32 --> 6696.119
guess what

6692.9 --> 6698.5199999999995
they're really not fans of genetically

6696.119 --> 6702.0599999999995
modified things yeah those same people

6698.52 --> 6705.3
they all went to Monsanto protests yeah

6702.06 --> 6707.9400000000005
so you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

6705.3 --> 6710.46
blabbering about at face and you need to

6707.94 --> 6712.86
shut your [ __ ] lying mouth

get the [ __ ] out

6718.8 --> 6721.8
foreign

6727.38 --> 6732.179
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

6730.08 --> 6734.48
as long as you've gone without weed or

6732.179 --> 6734.4800000000005

6752.52 --> 6756.8
six years so I never drank

6758.82 --> 6763.679
wait no four years

6762.3 --> 6767.2390000000005

that I didn't drink at all

6768.0 --> 6773.96
but and now I'm not drinking except for
