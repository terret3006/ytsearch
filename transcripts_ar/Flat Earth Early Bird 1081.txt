it's still kind of like yesterday it's

113.04 --> 118.07900000000001
covered with clouds

115.84 --> 122.56
it's less grey there's still

118.079 --> 122.55999999999999
a couple of blue spots in between

122.64 --> 127.6
but yeah the sun's not really going

124.64 --> 127.6
through all that much

127.68 --> 132.16
it is though

129.2 --> 132.16
kind of wind still

135.12 --> 139.04
and it doesn't like see misty

140.84 --> 145.92000000000002
so because yeah i can see very far

150.48 --> 153.48
right

160.879 --> 165.92
hello gadget inspector first in chat pj

163.599 --> 167.67999999999998
crew shank

165.92 --> 169.2
jeff gas head

167.68 --> 171.76000000000002
yeah good to see you guys how are you

169.2 --> 174.64
doing

171.76 --> 178.92
it is thursday the 25th

174.64 --> 178.92
of november 2021

184.239 --> 190.0
yeah yeah yeah

186.319 --> 190.0
yeah i just watched that back

190.4 --> 194.72
my performance yesterday as baldwin on

192.959 --> 196.56
mitchell from australia it was kind of

194.72 --> 197.35999999999999
like well people were pushing me to do

196.56 --> 200.4
it

197.36 --> 202.0
i was really toasty

200.4 --> 205.12
and you probably could hear it in my

202.0 --> 207.04
voice that i was kind of like

205.12 --> 210.64000000000001
a little slow down and i sometimes sound

207.04 --> 212.959
like that in the evening especially when

210.64 --> 216.07999999999998
i haven't been like mentally beefing

212.959 --> 217.519
myself up to start performing

216.08 --> 219.92000000000002
because it was really

217.519 --> 222.159
in the moment

219.92 --> 224.83999999999997
but yeah it was hilarious

222.159 --> 228.319
and listening back to it i was

224.84 --> 228.31900000000002
exemplary so

230.239 --> 234.239
all right

231.92 --> 236.23899999999998
here's the video with timestamp when i

234.239 --> 239.239
come in if you want to see that specific

236.239 --> 239.239
part

244.08 --> 247.68
i was a bit toasty yes

251.599 --> 255.04
but it was probably also one of the most

253.76 --> 259.479
polite

255.04 --> 259.479
ballers you've ever seen

272.8 --> 276.08
right yeah because you can get your

274.72 --> 278.40000000000003
arguments

276.08 --> 280.4
across much better if you just don't

278.4 --> 281.52
focus on

280.4 --> 284.71999999999997
oh

281.52 --> 288.15999999999997
i can't allow people to see what the

284.72 --> 291.199
other is saying no

288.16 --> 291.199
it's a waste of time

291.44 --> 297.84
you just gotta present a a good dream to

294.32 --> 297.84
latch on to that's it

298.0 --> 302.08
and then it's up to the listener to

299.919 --> 306.12
choose in their mind

302.08 --> 306.12
who are they gonna side with

318.96 --> 322.19899999999996
and then

328.08 --> 332.08
right so yeah i was on mitchell's

330.0 --> 334.96
yesterday

332.08 --> 334.96
it was hilarious

337.28 --> 343.52
and also by the way nice for a change

340.72 --> 345.36
because yeah it whenever whenever i get

343.52 --> 349.44
into ballwin mode

345.36 --> 351.039
over at nathan's everybody gets all like

349.44 --> 353.12
rumpacey

351.039 --> 355.28
they know they're trying to hold back

353.12 --> 356.4
but they all get so like oh shut up

355.28 --> 357.59999999999997
barwin

356.4 --> 359.75899999999996
this

357.6 --> 362.40000000000003
immediately roll out of the car logical

359.759 --> 364.56
counter arguments

362.4 --> 367.52
right and mitchell just didn't do that

364.56 --> 370.8
he was just interviewing a baller with

367.52 --> 372.639
sensible questions like a

370.8 --> 373.36
like a journalist would

372.639 --> 374.24
and

373.36 --> 377.759
that

374.24 --> 378.639
gave me like all the room to just

377.759 --> 383.039
be

378.639 --> 383.039
as concentrated a ball in as i could

384.0 --> 388.639
without constantly like having to be

386.72 --> 390.08000000000004
feeling forced like i have to ram my

388.639 --> 393.56
argument through because i'm going to be

390.08 --> 393.56
rompest over

401.28 --> 407.31899999999996
oh rompus went completely mental when he

403.759 --> 407.319
was caught lying

408.0 --> 413.36
that rompus

410.16 --> 413.36
oh oh dear

416.24 --> 422.759
yeah dude rumpus is definitely plagued

418.8 --> 422.759
by the ancestral winds

425.12 --> 430.08
like his long toes get even more

427.52 --> 430.08
sensitive

430.479 --> 433.599
it's very triggerable

444.24 --> 448.08
all right oh yeah

446.8 --> 451.40000000000003
uh

448.08 --> 451.4
what else

451.919 --> 457.71999999999997
made my gym rob that was live

454.72 --> 457.72
again

466.479 --> 471.28
oh yeah the the monday structure of gas

468.96 --> 473.75899999999996
debate at the flat earth debates

471.28 --> 476.15999999999997
so just to show like yeah you thought

473.759 --> 479.599
that ended on friday well it seems like

476.16 --> 481.759
it was only the beginning

479.599 --> 483.759
and there's like unexpected fronts

481.759 --> 487.199
forming which is like kind of silly to

483.759 --> 487.199
me that that's even happening

490.08 --> 494.0
right also jirenism

492.56 --> 496.56
uploaded a whole bunch of different

494.0 --> 496.56
videos

497.759 --> 502.319
or he live streamed and he uploaded some

499.84 --> 502.31899999999996
videos

502.8 --> 507.759
including one from an hour ago

505.599 --> 510.4
from like a skit that i remember and i

507.759 --> 512.24
was really weirded out when he did that

510.4 --> 515.919
live

512.24 --> 515.919
because that's a pretty old skit

516.32 --> 522.479
i remember the setup that's like

519.519 --> 522.479
like in the first

523.12 --> 527.76
like when jaren started to really do his

526.08 --> 530.1600000000001
own show

527.76 --> 531.8389999999999
and he got antonio super rats on there

530.16 --> 532.959
to act

531.839 --> 536.8800000000001
like

532.959 --> 539.5999999999999
basically to enact brian cox

536.88 --> 541.92
and it was like hilarious but also very

539.6 --> 544.72
confusing if you don't know brian cox so

541.92 --> 546.8389999999999
i didn't know brian cox i didn't i

544.72 --> 550.0
thought it was like what what what is

546.839 --> 552.24
this like antonio's acting really weird

550.0 --> 554.399
i don't get this i was just confused but

552.24 --> 556.64
now seeing it back i get totally what

554.399 --> 560.16
he's doing

556.64 --> 560.16
it's really fun watching it back

561.279 --> 566.8
it was kind of like a bit of inside

563.6 --> 567.6
humor that i that eluded me back in the

566.8 --> 570.0
day

567.6 --> 570.0
a bit

571.12 --> 577.519
because i only freshly got busy

574.56 --> 579.8389999999999
eh

577.519 --> 579.839
yeah

580.88 --> 585.0
that was fun seeing that back

604.399 --> 611.04
i seen an old show

608.16 --> 613.36
oh you mean 82

611.04 --> 613.36
yeah

614.48 --> 619.519
yeah i did come up yesterday also

616.959 --> 621.8389999999999
apparently it's my second and my second

619.519 --> 623.6
most viewed video now

621.839 --> 626.0790000000001
i was surprised that the other one was

623.6 --> 630.76
the first like with so many much more

626.079 --> 630.76
views i don't even understand why

632.32 --> 636.1600000000001
like that show didn't even have a title

645.04 --> 647.8389999999999
what

648.399 --> 654.6
crying box what what are you talking

650.72 --> 654.6
about jeff gas head

669.83 --> 675.839
[Music]

672.8 --> 675.8389999999999
oh man

678.24 --> 685.32
oh crying bucks brian cuffed oh okay

681.6 --> 685.32
i didn't see that

695.839 --> 703.0
is he still on tv

698.88 --> 703.0
like on tv tv

705.44 --> 711.519
or she just have a youtube channel

709.279 --> 714.639
i don't know man i don't i'm not really

711.519 --> 716.5600000000001
keeping track of all that

714.639 --> 719.279
i just remember that time when he came

716.56 --> 722.0
on the flat earth debates

719.279 --> 724.32
and basically admitted that he used used

722.0 --> 726.639
like the standard

724.32 --> 729.2
model

726.639 --> 731.839
and that he didn't have any evidence for

729.2 --> 731.839
r

732.32 --> 736.639
just very calmly admitted it

740.0 --> 744.519
all week bbc what

767.839 --> 772.7600000000001
now i got these inspectors a bit of a

769.76 --> 772.76
stretch

791.68 --> 798.5999999999999
they are brainwashing i still don't

794.079 --> 798.5999999999999
understand the context jeff gassett

808.56 --> 816.7199999999999
i mean i know like the bbc is

811.6 --> 819.72
pretty bad these days like heavy

816.72 --> 819.72
indoctrination

825.199 --> 830.16
like overall

826.72 --> 832.399
very politically influenced

830.16 --> 832.399
but

837.519 --> 842.639
like what is it what is the show you're

840.0 --> 844.959
talking about he has a show on the bbc

842.639 --> 847.6
so is it like oh this is

844.959 --> 849.4399999999999
this is our earth this is science it's a

847.6 --> 851.279
globe and flat earthers are wrong is

849.44 --> 853.44
that the show like what is it what is

851.279 --> 857.199
this show you're talking about

853.44 --> 859.1990000000001
like brian cox having a show on the bbc

857.199 --> 862.959
they are brainwashing the masses that

859.199 --> 862.959
literally tells me nothing

863.12 --> 870.44
that could be like anything

865.92 --> 870.4399999999999
what is it what is the show

891.36 --> 895.04
right let's get serious for a minute

896.16 --> 901.4399999999999
there's some show out there apparently

899.12 --> 905.16
jeff gas had brought it up

901.44 --> 905.1600000000001
now i want to know

919.92 --> 925.959
ah

921.199 --> 925.959
okay so it's just him doing a show

930.0 --> 934.0
so it's basically like ballers on

931.92 --> 937.199
youtube

934.0 --> 939.279
except he does it on tv

937.199 --> 941.68
is there like a live all is that is it

939.279 --> 944.399
like a studio audience type of show or

941.68 --> 948.2399999999999
is it just him on camera just like any

944.399 --> 948.24
youtuber except it's on tv

952.0 --> 956.959
because i know that bbc typically likes

954.48 --> 956.9590000000001
shows

957.279 --> 960.8
with audiences

959.04 --> 965.639
like a lot of people just sitting there

960.8 --> 965.639
and applauding or laughing or whatever

974.32 --> 977.32
so

990.32 --> 994.839
no audience expensive program okay so

993.12 --> 997.839
it's

994.839 --> 1001.2790000000001
basically kind of like

997.839 --> 1002.639
when neil degrasse tyson got

1001.279 --> 1004.48
on

1002.639 --> 1007.04
the history channel

1004.48 --> 1008.9590000000001
with all the cgi and he's in the

1007.04 --> 1011.36
spaceship going through what he's trying

1008.959 --> 1015.04
to talk about etc right so it's just

1011.36 --> 1015.04
expensive cgi support

1021.759 --> 1024.559
all

1022.839 --> 1028.199
right

1024.559 --> 1028.199
yeah makes sense

1038.64 --> 1044.5590000000002
so do the arguments make any sense like

1041.839 --> 1046.319
what level of arguments is he using is

1044.559 --> 1049.12
he literally

1046.319 --> 1052.8799999999999
confusing technicals mismatching

1049.12 --> 1054.799
technicals in the detailed areas thereby

1052.88 --> 1056.0800000000002
just maneuvering it through like it's a

1054.799 --> 1058.08
ball or

1056.08 --> 1059.6789999999999
is he actually drawing in some

1058.08 --> 1062.72
machinations like for example

1059.679 --> 1064.64
terrestrial refraction

1062.72 --> 1068.0
and then getting existential with like

1064.64 --> 1071.2800000000002
what what is his defense in general is

1068.0 --> 1073.84
he just recycling all 2015

1071.28 --> 1073.84
arguments

1075.039 --> 1079.679
is he being a word wizard

1077.84 --> 1083.12
or is he actually drawing in new

1079.679 --> 1083.1200000000001
machinations what is he doing

1085.6 --> 1089.1999999999998
i mean it's logical he would draw in

1087.2 --> 1091.679
machinations i mean the curvature

1089.2 --> 1095.32
calculator was basically his creation

1091.679 --> 1095.3200000000002
and that is imagination

1107.52 --> 1111.44
no argument

1108.88 --> 1115.5200000000002
but does he even like is there even a

1111.44 --> 1115.52
mention of flat earth that it exists

1116.4 --> 1123.24
or is it not even addressed

1118.559 --> 1123.24
is it like a globe safe space

1138.4 --> 1142.5590000000002
boats over the curve oh there oh there

1143.28 --> 1151.24
okay so yeah so he is going by the 2015

1147.039 --> 1151.24
standard he's just

1152.96 --> 1159.2
recycling the oldest arguments

1156.72 --> 1163.72
the basic stuff right

1159.2 --> 1163.72
tv stuff makes sense yeah

1167.76 --> 1171.919
right just use the old arguments and

1170.0 --> 1174.88
then

1171.919 --> 1176.24
don't let anybody know that they've all

1174.88 --> 1178.72
been debunked

1176.24 --> 1180.72
very easily and in detail

1178.72 --> 1183.28
and just don't mention it just start

1180.72 --> 1183.28
over again

1183.84 --> 1188.32
there's plenty of ignorant people or

1186.32 --> 1190.48
people that want to be ignorant and that

1188.32 --> 1194.08
want to just fall back on that old

1190.48 --> 1196.08
belief again trying to forget everything

1194.08 --> 1198.32
that they learned about it

1196.08 --> 1200.72
that kind of undoes it

1198.32 --> 1202.799
so yeah just recycle the old [ __ ] and

1200.72 --> 1205.28
people will forget and they will just

1202.799 --> 1209.12
latch on to that again

1205.28 --> 1211.76
like a reset a numpty reset

1209.12 --> 1211.76
makes sense

1214.24 --> 1218.24
right and by the way i talk from

1216.08 --> 1219.36
experience because

1218.24 --> 1221.919
i

1219.36 --> 1225.1999999999998
used to do that

1221.919 --> 1225.2
when i was still a baller

1227.52 --> 1232.8799999999999
you get to hear things that are like

1229.76 --> 1236.1589999999999
confusing and unnerving

1232.88 --> 1238.7990000000002
like what liars they're all liars like

1236.159 --> 1240.72
why would the foundational knowledge

1238.799 --> 1242.799
that everybody gets taught why would

1240.72 --> 1244.0
that be false right

1242.799 --> 1247.039
very

1244.0 --> 1249.679
unnerving when you feel things like that

1247.039 --> 1252.48
so when you just hear then somebody just

1249.679 --> 1254.3200000000002
calmly recycling the old arguments

1252.48 --> 1256.559
it's like soothing it's like ah it's

1254.32 --> 1258.24
okay forget about it just

1256.559 --> 1260.799
it's okay

1258.24 --> 1263.44
so you just listen to that and

1260.799 --> 1265.679
forget literally forget about the

1263.44 --> 1268.3200000000002
confrontation that kind of

1265.679 --> 1272.2800000000002
lifted that veil a little

1268.32 --> 1272.28
right it's all choice-based

1277.679 --> 1281.2
but yeah depends

1281.919 --> 1285.5200000000002
like how much of

1283.52 --> 1287.76
your consciousness comes into that

1285.52 --> 1291.28
choice or do you just leave it to your

1287.76 --> 1293.76
subconscious switch system

1291.28 --> 1295.6
and most people do that they leave it to

1293.76 --> 1298.24
their subconscious

1295.6 --> 1300.48
they can't actively think about reality

1298.24 --> 1303.679
like that

1300.48 --> 1306.96
this contortions in reality experience

1303.679 --> 1306.96
it's way too stressful

1311.2 --> 1316.3600000000001
never talk about the p900 okay

1341.919 --> 1344.72
yep

1342.88 --> 1347.6000000000001
yeah well gadget inspector that's how it

1344.72 --> 1349.039
works

1347.6 --> 1351.84
and normies

1349.039 --> 1354.559
literally see that sort of thing as that

1351.84 --> 1357.039
skit stuff

1354.559 --> 1359.28
kids are interested into that

1357.039 --> 1361.76
they like like and it does

1359.28 --> 1364.96
kind of put you to work in mechanically

1361.76 --> 1366.799
thinking right it activates you so yeah

1364.96 --> 1369.919
it is kind of kid stuff but yeah if you

1366.799 --> 1372.0
don't realize that it's all machinations

1369.919 --> 1373.8400000000001
and that your kids are actually in that

1372.0 --> 1376.88
process of just being active and

1373.84 --> 1380.24
mentally active and engaged

1376.88 --> 1381.44
being railroaded in a very specific

1380.24 --> 1383.679
format

1381.44 --> 1385.6000000000001
train of thinking

1383.679 --> 1389.44
that they're actually being conditioned

1385.6 --> 1390.799
while they are being activated and

1389.44 --> 1391.679
kept busy

1390.799 --> 1393.76
yeah

1391.679 --> 1396.76
normie parents don't realize that about

1393.76 --> 1396.76
it

1404.559 --> 1408.8799999999999
before the brain develops critical

1406.4 --> 1411.1200000000001
thinking skills it has been programmed

1408.88 --> 1411.1200000000001
no

1411.84 --> 1418.1589999999999
now now that just happens if

1414.72 --> 1420.4
a parent is like kind of stupid doesn't

1418.159 --> 1423.2
really know how to like

1420.4 --> 1425.2
spur their kid to thinking about things

1423.2 --> 1427.039
or know how to

1425.2 --> 1428.96
account for it how to deal with it how

1427.039 --> 1431.039
to present something that they can do

1428.96 --> 1433.919
something with like parents that just

1431.039 --> 1436.799
put a kid right in front of the tv at

1433.919 --> 1439.2
like very young age or click watch this

1436.799 --> 1441.679
that'll teach you yeah

1439.2 --> 1443.039
that way

1441.679 --> 1445.6000000000001
you get

1443.039 --> 1446.96
the program before you learn critical

1445.6 --> 1449.6789999999999
thinking

1446.96 --> 1452.72
that but that requires that sort of

1449.679 --> 1454.5590000000002
setup right if the parents just like are

1452.72 --> 1455.76
very engaged with their kids and their

1454.559 --> 1458.08
minds

1455.76 --> 1460.48
and are like available for questions

1458.08 --> 1461.84
constantly that they are basically their

1460.48 --> 1463.76
teachers

1461.84 --> 1466.0
that's not going to be a problem because

1463.76 --> 1467.12
they will have critical thinking skills

1466.0 --> 1468.48
because

1467.12 --> 1470.08
of course you're going to teach your kid

1468.48 --> 1471.3600000000001
how to critically think before you're

1470.08 --> 1473.76
going to

1471.36 --> 1477.4399999999998
put them behind yeah

1473.76 --> 1477.44
face let them face media

1478.159 --> 1482.0800000000002
it's only logical

1480.24 --> 1485.039
like if you start out putting your kid

1482.08 --> 1486.799
in front of a tv or a mobile

1485.039 --> 1488.64
before you learn

1486.799 --> 1490.96
before you teach them how to communicate

1488.64 --> 1493.3600000000001
and think yeah then you've they got a

1490.96 --> 1493.3600000000001
problem

1498.72 --> 1505.0
like most parents you mean i don't know

1500.559 --> 1505.0
i don't know about that see it depends

1530.08 --> 1535.1589999999999
hi yeah gadget inspector

1532.159 --> 1535.159
indeed

1603.36 --> 1607.6789999999999
they are not going to teach anything

1605.039 --> 1607.679
else than that

1609.679 --> 1611.6000000000001
well

1610.799 --> 1613.12
i

1611.6 --> 1615.12
well yeah if you're talking about the

1613.12 --> 1618.1589999999999
normies but i think there's still plenty

1615.12 --> 1618.1589999999999
of people out there

1618.32 --> 1623.84
that i myself for example come

1621.2 --> 1626.64
from a family where like

1623.84 --> 1629.4399999999998
we were all teachers like my mother and

1626.64 --> 1632.7990000000002
my father were both teachers in their

1629.44 --> 1634.4
respective area

1632.799 --> 1636.559
and

1634.4 --> 1638.96
it was constantly just communicating

1636.559 --> 1643.84
communicating and i was just asking

1638.96 --> 1643.8400000000001
about everything and i mean like

1644.399 --> 1647.52
well

1645.76 --> 1650.24
roughly said beyond your wildest

1647.52 --> 1652.96
imagination i would ask questions like

1650.24 --> 1656.3990000000001
even as if yeah as a five six seven year

1652.96 --> 1658.64
old i would really like do my best to

1656.399 --> 1660.32
like overreach

1658.64 --> 1664.0
but still be struck try to be

1660.32 --> 1666.32
structurally sound not just wild

1664.0 --> 1668.88
not just amp it up

1666.32 --> 1671.4399999999998
high tension but to really

1668.88 --> 1674.48
try to get a grasp of that which was

1671.44 --> 1677.279
still very far in the future to me

1674.48 --> 1678.3990000000001
but i knew it was gonna i was gonna grow

1677.279 --> 1680.88
into that

1678.399 --> 1683.12
i really did my best to like try to

1680.88 --> 1685.679
understand adult things even as a very

1683.12 --> 1685.6789999999999
young kid

1686.399 --> 1692.32
and yeah when you have a kid like that

1688.48 --> 1692.32
you can teach them a lot

1692.96 --> 1698.32
you can give them a foothold so that

1696.0 --> 1701.44
even at a young age they kind of get

1698.32 --> 1703.84
like how it's going to be flowing

1701.44 --> 1706.0
in their life like how we are

1703.84 --> 1707.6789999999999
they can

1706.0 --> 1710.559
gain trust

1707.679 --> 1714.0800000000002
and even a bit a glimpse of how they are

1710.559 --> 1714.08
going to develop themselves

1714.559 --> 1717.76
so they're just confident

1719.2 --> 1724.0800000000002
not yeah not worried like

1722.0 --> 1726.799
anything could change at any time

1724.08 --> 1729.799
dramatically

1726.799 --> 1729.799
anyway

1772.159 --> 1775.3200000000002
all right

1781.84 --> 1786.08
where is that mountain located

1783.92 --> 1788.0
[Laughter]

1786.08 --> 1790.6399999999999
yeah lop

1788.0 --> 1793.2
you might be surprised but that mountain

1790.64 --> 1796.5590000000002
and everything you see

1793.2 --> 1799.44
that's not inside of this arc is cgi

1796.559 --> 1801.84
it's a complete 3d render

1799.44 --> 1801.8400000000001
image

1802.399 --> 1807.6
pretty amazing right now for

1805.12 --> 1809.52
cgi s gum

1807.6 --> 1812.32
but yeah it's not actually based on a

1809.52 --> 1812.32
real location

1815.2 --> 1819.279
i i don't know it might have been lifted

1817.679 --> 1820.799
from a

1819.279 --> 1822.96
game world

1820.799 --> 1825.6
made into its own thing just a model

1822.96 --> 1827.44
copied from there or maybe somebody just

1825.6 --> 1829.52
got artistic i thought like i'm gonna

1827.44 --> 1831.679
make this beautiful landscape and that's

1829.52 --> 1831.679
it

1833.12 --> 1837.36
i don't know who made it adam plucked it

1835.039 --> 1840.1589999999999
from the internet somewhere as he so

1837.36 --> 1843.9189999999999
eloquently does he always finds really

1840.159 --> 1849.0800000000002
awesome animation things and all that

1843.919 --> 1849.0800000000002
he was taken in the moon what

1853.279 --> 1856.279
so

1882.159 --> 1887.3600000000001
ah well lop you don't know that

1886.0 --> 1890.08
i think that

1887.36 --> 1891.519
the mountain is not that far in the

1890.08 --> 1894.0
distance really

1891.519 --> 1895.919
like the landscape is kind of like

1894.0 --> 1898.799
looking up

1895.919 --> 1901.039
you're looking up a bit at the mountain

1898.799 --> 1903.44
like the horizon is not halfway the

1901.039 --> 1906.32
screen here

1903.44 --> 1907.519
so that mountain is actually closer by

1906.32 --> 1909.9189999999999
than you may

1907.519 --> 1913.2
than it may seem virtually because of

1909.919 --> 1913.2
course it's all cgi

1916.88 --> 1920.64
right this is not like a view on a

1919.519 --> 1923.2
horizon

1920.64 --> 1923.2
type of

1923.279 --> 1928.08
background picture it's kind of sloped

1926.24 --> 1931.559
upwards looking

1928.08 --> 1931.559
up to a mountain

1934.799 --> 1937.36
let's see

1939.279 --> 1943.519
i'll show you

1941.2 --> 1943.519
again

1944.0 --> 1947.0
see

1960.48 --> 1963.919
right yeah the nighttime isn't exactly

1962.399 --> 1966.9189999999999
helping

1963.919 --> 1966.919
uh

2015.36 --> 2018.6399999999999
yeah worship

2016.84 --> 2019.84
jesus a

2018.64 --> 2021.3600000000001
weird name

2019.84 --> 2026.36
like what are you

2021.36 --> 2026.36
bickering about against yeah spectre

2041.279 --> 2047.84
it looks

2043.36 --> 2047.84
four kilometers elevation

2048.639 --> 2052.48
okay

2050.24 --> 2055.2
oh by the way i do actually think that

2052.48 --> 2057.359
one of the mountains does have snow on

2055.2 --> 2057.359
it

2058.159 --> 2062.56
it's just that

2059.52 --> 2065.119
the gate is in front of it look again

2062.56 --> 2068.159
look again

2065.119 --> 2070.48
on the right side of that mountain

2068.159 --> 2070.48
see

2072.0 --> 2075.839
that kind of looks like snow

2080.0 --> 2085.679
i mean usu like there's generators for

2082.879 --> 2085.679
this sort of thing

2086.839 --> 2091.839
so like snow

2089.599 --> 2095.3590000000004
and the height and the cold is like

2091.839 --> 2097.599
automatically accounted for

2095.359 --> 2101.7999999999997
in those like

2097.599 --> 2101.8
make a landscape generator

2118.88 --> 2122.88
i'm starting to argue amongst themselves

2120.64 --> 2122.8799999999997
now

2126.16 --> 2131.44
what you want examples of ballers not

2129.04 --> 2133.2799999999997
getting their story straight

2131.44 --> 2137.119
uh

2133.28 --> 2137.119
are you serious worship jesus

2142.72 --> 2147.2799999999997
what about

2143.839 --> 2147.2799999999997
just the flip-flopping

2157.68 --> 2163.1189999999997
of the infighting

2160.8 --> 2165.3590000000004
well yeah infighting might be a bit of a

2163.119 --> 2168.2400000000002
big word for it

2165.359 --> 2168.24
it's more like just

2168.32 --> 2174.48
agitated sparring like by the way

2171.68 --> 2176.16
ballers get pretty or like anti-flat

2174.48 --> 2177.44
earthers and all that get kind of

2176.16 --> 2180.7999999999997
aggressive

2177.44 --> 2182.4
they're like they get very bullyish

2180.8 --> 2186.32
especially in their group dynamics and

2182.4 --> 2188.32
that includes towards just other ballers

2186.32 --> 2189.52
that happen to disagree about something

2188.32 --> 2193.6800000000003
right

2189.52 --> 2198.2
so but yeah is that infighting because

2193.68 --> 2198.2
infighting is a little bit more serious

2202.24 --> 2208.359
see some old fed shows what are you

2204.96 --> 2208.359
talking about

2214.0 --> 2218.88
do you think about concave earthers i

2215.92 --> 2218.88
think they're idiots

2224.48 --> 2227.359
i think concavers are

2226.32 --> 2230.1600000000003
worse

2227.359 --> 2230.16
than ballers

2236.48 --> 2240.48
unless it's

2237.92 --> 2242.8
kind of virtual and they don't really

2240.48 --> 2244.88
hang on to it like it's

2242.8 --> 2246.88
their religious duty

2244.88 --> 2249.04
right if they just think like no i think

2246.88 --> 2250.96
it could be concave it's just like yeah

2249.04 --> 2254.24
we don't really know then i'm like yeah

2250.96 --> 2255.52
okay good point we don't really know

2254.24 --> 2258.72
everything

2255.52 --> 2262.0
about what is this realm

2258.72 --> 2265.9199999999996
but to call it literally concave yeah

2262.0 --> 2265.92
well then you would require curvature

2267.839 --> 2273.44
and you would have absolutely

2271.88 --> 2275.28
undeniable

2273.44 --> 2277.359
long distance sites where you would

2275.28 --> 2280.1600000000003
start looking

2277.359 --> 2281.92
top down on landscape

2280.16 --> 2284.3999999999996
this is the logical geometric

2281.92 --> 2286.4
consequence like not not even some

2284.4 --> 2289.119
inverse terrestrial refraction is going

2286.4 --> 2289.119
to help with that

2291.359 --> 2297.92
right there's no curve and yeah

2294.96 --> 2299.599
the curve is already as elusive as it is

2297.92 --> 2302.56
on a globe

2299.599 --> 2305.76
well can you imagine how unbelievably

2302.56 --> 2308.0
elusive it must be on a concave earth

2305.76 --> 2311.28
where you're literally encode enclosed

2308.0 --> 2313.2
in a sphere so every landscape you know

2311.28 --> 2315.8390000000004
you have technically a straight line

2313.2 --> 2315.839
aside too

2317.52 --> 2319.839
yeah

2320.16 --> 2325.64
no

2321.359 --> 2325.64
no that doesn't work out at all

2352.56 --> 2356.88
at least they say the earth is

2354.079 --> 2356.88
stationary

2357.44 --> 2364.92
yeah it's still not a ball though right

2360.32 --> 2364.92
the main problem is the ball

2369.119 --> 2373.119
it's it's the virtual

2371.599 --> 2375.04
prison

2373.119 --> 2377.92
it's the shape prison

2375.04 --> 2380.16
that locks us in and prevents you from

2377.92 --> 2381.599
realizing like what the true nature is

2380.16 --> 2383.2799999999997
of

2381.599 --> 2386.48
all these things

2383.28 --> 2386.48
like the celestials

2392.96 --> 2395.96
right

2401.54 --> 2406.52
[Music]

2403.52 --> 2406.52
so

2420.64 --> 2423.64
hmm

2426.319 --> 2429.72
hey eric1111

2441.2 --> 2445.5989999999997
concave makes it a lot more complex

2444.16 --> 2446.72
well

2445.599 --> 2447.839
no

2446.72 --> 2450.56
but

2447.839 --> 2452.72
in order to justify why it doesn't look

2450.56 --> 2455.359
concave

2452.72 --> 2458.16
is a lot more complex than to justify

2455.359 --> 2462.359
why it doesn't look like a ball

2458.16 --> 2462.359
yes in that sense yes

2476.0 --> 2481.28
right because on a ball you have to

2477.44 --> 2484.079
justify why you do see certain things

2481.28 --> 2485.6800000000003
even though geometrically you shouldn't

2484.079 --> 2488.2400000000002
but

2485.68 --> 2491.68
it's a very easy reference to just say

2488.24 --> 2494.0
like oh but yeah we see mirages

2491.68 --> 2494.8799999999997
they're not really there so it's just

2494.0 --> 2498.079
yeah

2494.88 --> 2501.04
it's like mirrored over the globe it's

2498.079 --> 2504.8
easier to imagine

2501.04 --> 2506.96
than to try and find an excuse as to

2504.8 --> 2510.5600000000004
why things look flat

2506.96 --> 2511.76
while on the inside of a globe

2510.56 --> 2514.7599999999998
like

2511.76 --> 2514.76
what

2527.04 --> 2532.48
right when you should geometrically have

2529.2 --> 2535.5989999999997
a straight line of sight to everything

2532.48 --> 2538.0
like try and justify that that's a

2535.599 --> 2539.6800000000003
bit of a stretch literally

2538.0 --> 2541.52
i mean i think that terrestrial

2539.68 --> 2545.7599999999998
refraction for the globe is already

2541.52 --> 2545.7599999999998
quite a stretch but it's kind of doable

2546.8 --> 2551.6800000000003
but on a concave no way it's just

2550.319 --> 2553.7599999999998
untenable

2551.68 --> 2558.1189999999997
completely untenable nobody's gonna buy

2553.76 --> 2558.119
that on an intuitive level nobody

2572.8 --> 2575.8
um

2582.079 --> 2587.2000000000003
what have continue

2584.64 --> 2589.2
another three to five thousand shows

2587.2 --> 2591.2799999999997
sheesh

2589.2 --> 2593.52
well let's just see what happens to the

2591.28 --> 2595.92
world when we get there

2593.52 --> 2595.92
okay

2598.48 --> 2601.92
will i keep on doing this

2602.079 --> 2606.2400000000002
probably

2603.68 --> 2608.16
right i'm not really even tied in with

2606.24 --> 2610.7999999999997
some

2608.16 --> 2613.7599999999998
virtual obligation

2610.8 --> 2616.319
that is draining me right i'm not like

2613.76 --> 2619.28
forcing myself like i'm only gonna talk

2616.319 --> 2619.2799999999997
about flat earth

2619.68 --> 2623.04
right as long as i do that then

2622.24 --> 2625.2799999999997
like

2623.04 --> 2627.2799999999997
it's simply an opportunity for me to

2625.28 --> 2629.28
bring something to the table to develop

2627.28 --> 2631.28
skills to

2629.28 --> 2635.0
at the same time kind of sort of perform

2631.28 --> 2635.0
a social service

2635.04 --> 2640.16
be open for questions and answers

2637.76 --> 2642.96
about pretty much anything

2640.16 --> 2647.8799999999997
and yeah i can keep on going like that

2642.96 --> 2647.88
forever it's just what i do

2654.8 --> 2657.92
but

2656.4 --> 2661.28
i'm not

2657.92 --> 2662.8
envisioning like literally nothing else

2661.28 --> 2664.5600000000004
changing

2662.8 --> 2667.52
like i like to

2664.56 --> 2667.52
at some point

2669.04 --> 2673.119
get a better place to live for example

2675.04 --> 2679.44
or improve my financial situation but

2677.28 --> 2681.599
hey i'm working on that constantly here

2679.44 --> 2685.2000000000003
right here by

2681.599 --> 2685.2000000000003
asking you guys for support

2685.52 --> 2689.64
and it does work out

2698.8 --> 2705.7200000000003
it's good if you do what you enjoy now

2701.04 --> 2705.72
it's not only good it's essential

2706.72 --> 2709.359
because

2707.599 --> 2712.079
if you're going to be doing it for a

2709.359 --> 2714.319
very very long time

2712.079 --> 2717.319
then boredom becomes

2714.319 --> 2717.319
fatal

2718.8 --> 2723.3590000000004
like your ego just starts to protest and

2721.28 --> 2725.52
starts to break you up and then it

2723.359 --> 2726.56
doesn't work anymore like you gotta

2725.52 --> 2729.68
actually

2726.56 --> 2732.88
wanna do it you gotta enjoy it you gotta

2729.68 --> 2737.04
find renewed inspiration over and over

2732.88 --> 2737.04
and over and over again somehow

2738.24 --> 2742.0789999999997
because if you can't then you can't

2740.72 --> 2744.7999999999997
hold on to

2742.079 --> 2748.319
a job or

2744.8 --> 2751.04
tradition whenever however you see it

2748.319 --> 2754.64
for very long periods of time

2751.04 --> 2758.24
it's gonna be become like a hell to you

2754.64 --> 2758.24
boring repetitive

2759.52 --> 2764.24
and then that's gonna like radiate off

2762.24 --> 2766.64
you as well and that's gonna make it

2764.24 --> 2768.7999999999997
very unenjoyable

2766.64 --> 2770.8799999999997
to viewers because yeah that

2768.8 --> 2772.88
that radiates off you so if you're

2770.88 --> 2775.839
actually enjoying you actually feel

2772.88 --> 2775.839
freedom

2777.44 --> 2781.76
then that's going to radiate off you and

2779.839 --> 2784.319
i hope that's working i

2781.76 --> 2787.28
i've put in substantial effort over the

2784.319 --> 2791.599
years to really get that frequency thing

2787.28 --> 2794.4
right and not to get carried away into

2791.599 --> 2794.4
dark pits

2795.839 --> 2800.0
so that i don't accidentally drag you

2798.16 --> 2802.56
with me

2800.0 --> 2806.48
it still does happen sometimes i do get

2802.56 --> 2806.48
caught up in things get passionate

2807.28 --> 2811.8390000000004
but

2808.24 --> 2814.319
i really see it as like a risk factor

2811.839 --> 2817.52
and a risk factor that i can actually do

2814.319 --> 2819.52
something about i don't feel as out of

2817.52 --> 2821.52
control as i did say

2819.52 --> 2823.7599999999998
three years ago

2821.52 --> 2826.0
where literally things would just burst

2823.76 --> 2827.119
forth from me and had no more control or

2826.0 --> 2831.64
was

2827.119 --> 2831.6400000000003
not enough control to stop it

2835.359 --> 2841.92
can you draw nah

2838.4 --> 2845.92
yeah i can i'm a sketcher

2841.92 --> 2845.92
but no i'm not really it

2848.079 --> 2851.8390000000004
i don't think i'm really good at it

2853.76 --> 2860.96
i mean i have even painted and all that

2856.16 --> 2860.96
but that's like 20 years ago now

2861.119 --> 2866.0
because i did try to get like in art

2863.2 --> 2867.2
school and all that

2866.0 --> 2868.0
sort of

2867.2 --> 2871.2
game

2868.0 --> 2871.2
computer game art

2871.28 --> 2874.3190000000004
but they wouldn't have me

2874.8 --> 2880.8
because i didn't

2877.2 --> 2880.7999999999997
i don't know i wasn't like

2881.68 --> 2887.839
i i can't say i they just didn't want me

2892.24 --> 2895.24
what

2921.76 --> 2925.599
yeah that's a

2923.44 --> 2929.319
that can seriously be

2925.599 --> 2929.319
that's a sock account

2944.87 --> 2948.08
[Music]

2952.8 --> 2955.52
yeah

2953.68 --> 2958.16
forget about a steamy traveler that's

2955.52 --> 2960.96
not what i do

2958.16 --> 2960.96
i just talk

2963.68 --> 2968.839
like by the time i'm going to have like

2965.92 --> 2972.4
things and selling them

2968.839 --> 2974.96
again i'm probably gonna be much less

2972.4 --> 2978.28
active here on media

2974.96 --> 2978.28
when i do

3013.599 --> 3018.6400000000003
do you think you're able to sustain a

3015.52 --> 3022.28
healthy financial platform while doing

3018.64 --> 3022.2799999999997
well yeah

3028.48 --> 3031.119
i am

3029.76 --> 3033.5200000000004
devil's pulpit

3031.119 --> 3035.76
like what i'm doing now has been

3033.52 --> 3037.839
financially the most successful

3035.76 --> 3039.76
operation i've ever done

3037.839 --> 3043.52
by far

3039.76 --> 3043.5200000000004
especially motivation wise

3046.4 --> 3050.7200000000003
like everyday show

3049.2 --> 3052.96
yeah yeah well

3050.72 --> 3054.5589999999997
realize that an everyday show is in its

3052.96 --> 3057.44
own right even though i'm kind of in

3054.559 --> 3060.2400000000002
control of when i do it and when i don't

3057.44 --> 3063.599
it's like a job you do every day

3060.24 --> 3064.9599999999996
oh only in only two hours

3063.599 --> 3067.3590000000004
right

3064.96 --> 3069.599
oh you only do you do only two hours

3067.359 --> 3071.92
every day

3069.599 --> 3076.1600000000003
that's a job

3071.92 --> 3077.76
like it's the longest lasting job

3076.16 --> 3081.0
i've ever done

3077.76 --> 3081.0
so far

3082.079 --> 3086.88
your paypal okay

3084.96 --> 3090.359
[ __ ] borge

3086.88 --> 3090.359
what the [ __ ]

3101.599 --> 3103.92
oh

3108.72 --> 3111.839
that's gotta be fake

3125.52 --> 3129.44
but yeah it's a good opportunity to do

3127.76 --> 3132.7200000000003
actually send me something through the

3129.44 --> 3134.319
paypal even though i don't think that

3132.72 --> 3135.9199999999996
[ __ ]

3134.319 --> 3138.0
beorge

3135.92 --> 3139.28
is actually sending in paypal i think

3138.0 --> 3142.68
he's just

3139.28 --> 3142.6800000000003
being a troll

3161.2 --> 3168.8799999999997
no although i've never

3164.48 --> 3168.88
kim yoongi never heard of him

3169.2 --> 3173.359
perspective wrongs all right cool

3175.68 --> 3180.839
i really liked asher in the day

3186.0 --> 3191.76
no one would pay you for this [ __ ]

3189.359 --> 3191.7599999999998
really

3192.24 --> 3196.0789999999997
well

3193.359 --> 3198.96
i think you're wrong they do they

3196.079 --> 3198.96
literally do

3202.319 --> 3206.5589999999997
all right and just because it's silent

3204.48 --> 3209.839
half the time with it's not half the

3206.559 --> 3211.52
time it's more like a fifth

3209.839 --> 3215.7599999999998
at worst

3211.52 --> 3217.68
it's because i'm also like reading

3215.76 --> 3220.3190000000004
what's being said and like

3217.68 --> 3223.68
not just surface reading really trying

3220.319 --> 3226.0
to understand what the chat is doing

3223.68 --> 3228.0
to see if i can find a hook to start a

3226.0 --> 3230.96
conversation

3228.0 --> 3233.44
because i don't really have a

3230.96 --> 3235.52
program every day

3233.44 --> 3237.68
in the sense like oh this subject that

3235.52 --> 3239.68
subject like unless something just

3237.68 --> 3241.2799999999997
freshly happened

3239.68 --> 3243.04
and it's on my heart and my mind and

3241.28 --> 3244.96
then i'm gonna talk about it that

3243.04 --> 3246.319
doesn't always happen all the time and

3244.96 --> 3249.92
sometimes

3246.319 --> 3252.319
there's i on purpose trying not to do it

3249.92 --> 3254.48
because i don't want to always have

3252.319 --> 3255.839
something to talk about and that way get

3254.48 --> 3257.839
carried away

3255.839 --> 3260.48
with subjects that i don't really want

3257.839 --> 3260.48
to get into

3261.119 --> 3265.28
so yeah

3262.559 --> 3267.8390000000004
silence is unfortunately part of this

3265.28 --> 3270.079
live interaction show

3267.839 --> 3271.119
where i interact with chat this is not

3270.079 --> 3274.2400000000002
just

3271.119 --> 3277.6800000000003
a video you're watching that happens to

3274.24 --> 3280.9599999999996
have a side chat no the chat is actually

3277.68 --> 3283.359
a live interactive part of this live

3280.96 --> 3286.68
recorded show you see

3283.359 --> 3286.68
it's different

3295.52 --> 3299.2
do you have to claim any earnings from

3297.44 --> 3301.28
youtube

3299.2 --> 3305.48
as income yes

3301.28 --> 3305.48
yes i do and i do that

3307.599 --> 3314.4
right that's also why i asked like

3310.64 --> 3315.92
i prefer donut donations through paypal

3314.4 --> 3318.88
because

3315.92 --> 3321.28
yeah i'm still living off social welfare

3318.88 --> 3323.04
oh they're out there in the netherlands

3321.28 --> 3326.1600000000003
who could have foreseen that unless

3323.04 --> 3326.16
you're like a grabbler

3326.48 --> 3331.44
that not everybody that knows how to get

3328.4 --> 3333.359
around the netherlands as a grappler

3331.44 --> 3335.119
there's really hardworking people here

3333.359 --> 3336.64
but they tend to get kind of screwed

3335.119 --> 3338.96
over if they don't know how to deal with

3336.64 --> 3338.96
money

3341.359 --> 3346.24
but yeah in the netherlands things are

3343.68 --> 3349.52
kind of expensive overall

3346.24 --> 3351.4399999999996
it's very socialist oriented

3349.52 --> 3355.28
so

3351.44 --> 3355.28
living here costs more

3356.64 --> 3362.0789999999997
it's hard to get around unless you have

3358.559 --> 3364.559
like a really sizable income

3362.079 --> 3367.2000000000003
and i don't so i do live of social

3364.559 --> 3368.2400000000002
welfare for a while

3367.2 --> 3371.52
and

3368.24 --> 3376.1189999999997
that wouldn't be enough

3371.52 --> 3376.119
to get around that's the problem

3380.64 --> 3386.0789999999997
and that's yeah why i also need

3383.68 --> 3389.64
donations to get around it's literally

3386.079 --> 3389.6400000000003
for my food

3394.799 --> 3400.48
trying to live in new york

3396.64 --> 3400.48
yeah well i wouldn't want to live there

3403.52 --> 3408.48
it's not my city i don't really like

3406.4 --> 3409.52
super big cities

3408.48 --> 3411.359
like

3409.52 --> 3415.04
utrecht

3411.359 --> 3417.52
is by dutch standard a pretty big city

3415.04 --> 3421.2799999999997
but i'm not like in the center of it i'm

3417.52 --> 3422.4
at the outskirt of that city where it's

3421.28 --> 3423.3590000000004
actually

3422.4 --> 3425.6800000000003
like

3423.359 --> 3426.96
in between suburban

3425.68 --> 3428.5589999999997
and urban

3426.96 --> 3430.079
with a lot of green

3428.559 --> 3432.7200000000003
around

3430.079 --> 3434.48
so this is like perfect for me

3432.72 --> 3437.68
but i'm not like a

3434.48 --> 3440.0
center of city kind of guy everything is

3437.68 --> 3443.68
expensive as [ __ ] there

3440.0 --> 3446.64
and you're constantly having people

3443.68 --> 3448.64
like always bumping into people always

3446.64 --> 3452.48
chattering and some people think that's

3448.64 --> 3455.2799999999997
great i don't really think that's great

3452.48 --> 3458.079
i'm not against it i just don't happen

3455.28 --> 3460.7200000000003
to like it very much i like

3458.079 --> 3463.2000000000003
having peace and quiet on my mind

3460.72 --> 3464.799
a lot of the time

3463.2 --> 3470.0
and then again i'm like sick of it and

3464.799 --> 3470.0
then i tune into things like go on media

3470.96 --> 3474.64
right

3472.319 --> 3477.92
but i'm not like a guy that's always

3474.64 --> 3477.92
hanging around in groups

3480.48 --> 3487.319
so yeah inner city stuff is not really

3484.0 --> 3487.319
my thing

3497.839 --> 3501.599
the home of the paint what are you

3500.4 --> 3503.839
talking about

3501.599 --> 3503.839
is it

3505.359 --> 3509.359
if you say so old house rudborn

3510.16 --> 3516.64
i mean thankfully i'm not smelling like

3513.76 --> 3517.76
chemical paint [ __ ] in the air all the

3516.64 --> 3520.799
time

3517.76 --> 3524.1600000000003
i'm not smelling any paint factory

3520.799 --> 3526.799
i do smell like the coffee factory

3524.16 --> 3526.799
regularly

3528.799 --> 3533.28
mecca expensive art supply really

3531.839 --> 3534.799
huh

3533.28 --> 3537.799

3554.48 --> 3561.839
keyboards are expensive what

3559.2 --> 3561.839

3568.48 --> 3573.4
it wasn't expensive it still works

3590.4 --> 3594.079
oh khmer yeah i do know that

3598.64 --> 3601.839

3602.799 --> 3608.88
that's like northwest region in north

3605.839 --> 3608.88
holland province

3609.68 --> 3614.68
utrecht is dead center it's right in the

3611.68 --> 3614.68
middle

3634.64 --> 3639.7599999999998

3699.28 --> 3702.559
okay i didn't know there was any other

3701.44 --> 3704.2400000000002
place

3702.559 --> 3706.6400000000003

3724.72 --> 3727.72
no

3740.88 --> 3745.92
there's an art brand culture oh you

3743.52 --> 3748.16
think it would be named after the city

3745.92 --> 3750.559
no of course not

3748.16 --> 3755.2799999999997
maybe it would be that's weird

3750.559 --> 3757.76
art brand called never heard of it

3755.28 --> 3761.039
but there are some like

3757.76 --> 3763.76
there's plenty of art stores here

3761.039 --> 3766.48

3776.72 --> 3782.0389999999998
them

3778.72 --> 3782.0389999999998

3785.119 --> 3789.119
you attract a part of new york city

3789.52 --> 3797.079

the english bought it off the

3801.52 --> 3804.52
netherlands

3810.559 --> 3815.44
so there might be some dutch names

3812.64 --> 3816.96
lingering in there here and there

3815.44 --> 3820.44
in that region

3816.96 --> 3820.44
because of it

3826.64 --> 3833.24

british

3958.16 --> 3963.2799999999997
mixed in with americans

4069.039 --> 4074.0
it's literally the center of europe if

4071.599 --> 4076.6400000000003
you look at the map yeah but which map

4074.0 --> 4078.96

4076.64 --> 4080.96
but i get what you mean yeah yeah the

4078.96 --> 4083.44
czech checky

4080.96 --> 4087.079
czech republic is pretty

4083.44 --> 4087.079

4104.88 --> 4107.88
minutes

4226.96 --> 4229.96

they named it arwen okay

4291.28 --> 4294.599999999999

4333.12 --> 4336.88
thanksgiving like holidays

4338.64 --> 4341.64
uh

4347.12 --> 4352.32
not exactly like that

4349.44 --> 4354.32
i mean there might be some

4352.32 --> 4357.36
like other traditions

4354.32 --> 4360.32
that are kind of like matching

4357.36 --> 4361.679
the same time slot and then

4360.32 --> 4366.12
i don't know

4361.679 --> 4366.12
there's probably some of those

4371.76 --> 4376.2390000000005
oh okay

4373.28 --> 4379.96
service day all right

4376.239 --> 4379.959999999999

4514.0 --> 4519.48

4528.0 --> 4531.0
hmm

4558.239 --> 4561.4
all right

4599.84 --> 4602.32
all right

4604.239 --> 4610.48
hey is that a bit of sun coming through

4608.159 --> 4614.159
ah by the way yeah the sky has suddenly

4610.48 --> 4614.159
cleared up a lot take it out

4615.84 --> 4620.28
so blue

4617.04 --> 4620.28
it's incredible

4634.719 --> 4639.92
man i think that yesterday

4637.199 --> 4641.44
doing oh doing that ball win skit over

4639.92 --> 4643.76
at mitchell from australia this might

4641.44 --> 4643.759999999999
have just

4643.92 --> 4648.96
like especially me doing the coffee then

4646.48 --> 4650.5599999999995
i think it kind of like toasted me up

4648.96 --> 4651.52
extra now

4650.56 --> 4654.320000000001
this is

4651.52 --> 4656.8
i was like feeling really weird over it

4654.32 --> 4659.04
afterward

4656.8 --> 4659.04
like

4661.28 --> 4665.5199999999995
i don't think everybody

4663.04 --> 4667.76
fully understands like the seriousness

4665.52 --> 4669.1990000000005
of the enactment basically what that

4667.76 --> 4672.0
does to me

4669.199 --> 4672.0
because it yeah

4672.159 --> 4677.44
i mean i loved doing it it was great

4675.44 --> 4680.639999999999
but like afterward i felt like really

4677.44 --> 4682.96
weird for like hours

4680.64 --> 4685.92
it's like okay what are people actually

4682.96 --> 4685.92
gonna think of that

4689.36 --> 4693.5199999999995
because maybe i'm doing a little bit too

4691.52 --> 4694.88
well you see

4693.52 --> 4698.159000000001
maybe that

4694.88 --> 4698.159000000001
gets on people's nerves

4698.88 --> 4701.36
i don't know

4705.36 --> 4711.199
but yeah having coffee late in the

4708.239 --> 4713.5199999999995
evening after sundown is just not a good

4711.199 --> 4716.32
thing for me i should really just try to

4713.52 --> 4716.320000000001
never do that

4718.4 --> 4721.839999999999
it kind of wears on me

4735.52 --> 4740.4800000000005
yeah i definitely did need a coffee

4737.44 --> 4740.48
before getting into it

4740.8 --> 4744.400000000001
it was awesome i guess

4746.48 --> 4750.879999999999
i mean i liked it because

4748.48 --> 4752.718999999999
i wasn't constantly getting rumpus by

4750.88 --> 4754.08
everybody

4752.719 --> 4756.4
because god

4754.08 --> 4759.36
like over at fed

4756.4 --> 4761.44
it's very rumpassy as of late and yeah

4759.36 --> 4763.679
oh are when you're complaining about

4761.44 --> 4765.28
rumps yeah because everybody's rumpusing

4763.679 --> 4767.679
you you can barely get a word you have

4765.28 --> 4768.8
to sneak attack a word in

4767.679 --> 4771.12
now

4768.8 --> 4772.719
and i i've been trained to do that for

4771.12 --> 4775.04
years

4772.719 --> 4777.6
so i know how to sneak attack an

4775.04 --> 4779.28
argument in and then keep it short so

4777.6 --> 4780.719
that not everybody's gonna get all

4779.28 --> 4782.0
outraged

4780.719 --> 4783.12
it's what i do

4782.0 --> 4785.44
it's

4783.12 --> 4785.44
yeah

4785.84 --> 4790.0
but yeah you can't like when i go

4787.84 --> 4792.719
baldwin

4790.0 --> 4795.92
the guys and after nathan himself just

4792.719 --> 4797.04
don't allow me to just lay it down

4795.92 --> 4798.96
they're gonna

4797.04 --> 4800.96
have to talk over it

4798.96 --> 4803.04
every time now

4800.96 --> 4804.4800000000005
and so it was a bit of a luxury not

4803.04 --> 4805.92
having that

4804.48 --> 4807.678999999999
yesterday with

4805.92 --> 4811.28
with mitchell

4807.679 --> 4814.56
he would just let me calmly

4811.28 --> 4814.5599999999995
roll out the entire thing

4816.88 --> 4820.96
and that was nice

4818.8 --> 4823.360000000001
to just have that freedom maneuvering

4820.96 --> 4823.36
freedom

4829.52 --> 4834.76
yes exactly his timing was excellent

4852.88 --> 4855.88
uh

4862.56 --> 4865.56
um

4884.48 --> 4887.48
oh

4896.719 --> 4901.28
all right so yeah if you haven't checked

4898.719 --> 4901.28
that out

4901.679 --> 4906.719
then

4902.719 --> 4906.719
yeah take a look after my show

4907.6 --> 4910.4800000000005
i'll

4908.4 --> 4912.5599999999995
put in the link again of mitchell's show

4910.48 --> 4917.08
where i appeared yesterday as balwin

4912.56 --> 4917.080000000001
with timestamp when i came in

4937.679 --> 4942.8
yeah i'm a bit toasty today

4939.92 --> 4944.4800000000005
still i think it sometimes happens like

4942.8 --> 4947.04
in the past two you know

4944.48 --> 4949.04
especially in the early bird like the

4947.04 --> 4952.32
first 200 shows

4949.04 --> 4954.639
i would also get very active at night

4952.32 --> 4957.199
sometimes

4954.639 --> 4960.400000000001
and just like hang around in discord at

4957.199 --> 4961.919999999999
places and sometimes even record some of

4960.4 --> 4964.08
it

4961.92 --> 4964.08
but

4965.44 --> 4968.5599999999995
i don't know

4966.719 --> 4972.32
now when i do that

4968.56 --> 4974.159000000001
it kind of drains me the next day

4972.32 --> 4978.239
it's weird

4974.159 --> 4978.239
it's like i don't have that much

4978.719 --> 4986.0
attention i guess to spread around

4982.719 --> 4988.56
so i can't just keep doing this all day

4986.0 --> 4989.92
like i i take a lot of time just kind of

4988.56 --> 4993.6
like

4989.92 --> 4996.96
letting it all sink and just

4993.6 --> 4996.96
setting up mentally

4997.36 --> 5001.12
is it even mentally it's more like the

4999.52 --> 5004.0
energy

5001.12 --> 5006.159
set up the energy to

5004.0 --> 5008.4
to be able to function

5006.159 --> 5011.199
for what i typically do

5008.4 --> 5012.96
and then like requires me

5011.199 --> 5017.28
to basically

5012.96 --> 5020.0
focus on doing that basically i'm just

5017.28 --> 5022.159
no that's a lot of basically but

5020.0 --> 5023.36
i spent a lot of time in the day

5022.159 --> 5026.0
focusing

5023.36 --> 5028.96
on doing the show next day it sounds

5026.0 --> 5031.36
weird but it is what it is

5028.96 --> 5033.12
so if i then start doing other stuff in

5031.36 --> 5035.5199999999995
between

5033.12 --> 5037.92
that sometimes distracts

5035.52 --> 5040.0
me from doing that and then i'm more

5037.92 --> 5043.84
flustered less focused

5040.0 --> 5043.84
on my regular show the next day

5068.84 --> 5074.08
right

5070.639 --> 5076.4800000000005
although for example when i

5074.08 --> 5078.08
when i am active like on ball buster's

5076.48 --> 5080.959999999999
life

5078.08 --> 5083.92
then usually doesn't really hamper me

5080.96 --> 5086.2390000000005
but that is also because i'm then just a

5083.92 --> 5086.2390000000005
guest

5086.32 --> 5092.639
i'm not like the main focus of attention

5089.12 --> 5094.96
it doesn't tap into as much energy

5092.639 --> 5098.679
but yeah yesterday i put on a real

5094.96 --> 5098.679
prolonged act

5098.96 --> 5104.12
and that does tap in energy anyway

5120.719 --> 5123.92
i think i remember that

5125.52 --> 5129.76
there's plenty of dutch bands

5132.719 --> 5137.719
hey elise g good to see you

5148.48 --> 5152.0
focus

5149.44 --> 5152.0
i don't know

5152.719 --> 5156.84
i've never heard of that bad

5179.28 --> 5183.5599999999995
is it thanksgiving right now

5184.08 --> 5188.36
or is it this weekend or something

5228.8 --> 5234.56
are you trying to

5231.36 --> 5234.5599999999995
that's lyrics right

5234.8 --> 5237.8
cleary

5239.36 --> 5244.4
because that seemed copy pasted

5242.0 --> 5247.36
it's missing some

5244.4 --> 5247.36
dots here and there

5248.08 --> 5252.199
right that makes sense

5258.08 --> 5261.08
hmm

5274.48 --> 5280.08
oh wow

5276.159 --> 5282.5599999999995
man the weather's changed around

5280.08 --> 5285.6
look at that

5282.56 --> 5287.92
nice and sunny

5285.6 --> 5292.0
how cleared up this is

5287.92 --> 5292.0
it's like what a contrast to earlier

5293.04 --> 5297.28
plot playing flying up there

5296.0 --> 5300.84
not

5297.28 --> 5300.84
leaving a trail

5338.08 --> 5343.679
come on clary why would you say that

5340.56 --> 5346.679
this is a terrible phrase

5343.679 --> 5346.679
uh

5359.679 --> 5363.8
you're getting a beer what

5364.719 --> 5368.88
isn't that a bit early gadget inspector

5370.96 --> 5373.679
all right

5371.84 --> 5376.32
i think i'm gonna round out the show i'm

5373.679 --> 5378.4
still kind of toasty maybe it's just the

5376.32 --> 5380.719
time of the day and everybody is like

5378.4 --> 5383.839999999999
this

5380.719 --> 5387.199
but i don't feel like oh wow this this

5383.84 --> 5389.4400000000005
show is super exhilarating

5387.199 --> 5391.599999999999
yesterday though there was a lot of

5389.44 --> 5396.44
detail

5391.6 --> 5396.4400000000005
today is not one of those shows i think

5406.4 --> 5412.48
what half

5408.639 --> 5415.92
half past two is not early for a beer i

5412.48 --> 5415.919999999999
i beg to differ it is

5416.96 --> 5421.199
like i don't

5418.32 --> 5424.4
i would wait at least until four o'clock

5421.199 --> 5424.4
but yeah that's just me

5433.44 --> 5439.839999999999
copy paste detective yeah i dude i

5435.84 --> 5439.84
detect copy paste very easily

5444.639 --> 5448.56
still a good show pj grushank thanks i

5447.04 --> 5452.96
appreciate that

5448.56 --> 5452.96
it's just easy going hang around show

5454.159 --> 5457.04
today at least

5459.52 --> 5464.320000000001
is well over an hour late for a

5462.239 --> 5468.44
lunchtime beer

5464.32 --> 5468.44
adam that's just terrible

5481.199 --> 5485.759999999999
but since it is kind of thanksgiving

5483.44 --> 5489.19
time i guess

5485.76 --> 5492.46
when when is it exactly what's the date

5489.19 --> 5492.46
[Applause]

5493.36 --> 5496.08
25th

5495.04 --> 5497.84
oh

5496.08 --> 5499.679
it is today

5497.84 --> 5501.28
in the united states

5499.679 --> 5503.04
all right

5501.28 --> 5505.199
well maybe i'll

5503.04 --> 5507.5199999999995
have a chicken broccoli dinner in this

5505.199 --> 5507.5199999999995
evening

5510.159 --> 5516.759999999999
that does sound appealing to me actually

5513.76 --> 5516.76
hmm

5528.32 --> 5531.679
i didn't call you a numpty logical

5530.48 --> 5535.678999999999
conclusion

5531.679 --> 5537.679
well i didn't need to you just did

5535.679 --> 5542.1990000000005
you just did it for me

5537.679 --> 5542.1990000000005
because you understand that's good

5553.679 --> 5559.679
have i ball wind myself out yeah

5557.36 --> 5561.92
ball wind yes

5559.679 --> 5563.84
i sort of have

5561.92 --> 5565.52
great stuff yesterday you did see it all

5563.84 --> 5567.28
right

5565.52 --> 5569.92
yeah i watched it back this morning it

5567.28 --> 5574.04
was hilarious

5569.92 --> 5574.04
but it was kind of draining

5582.0 --> 5587.199
like i have a lot more energy to like

5584.32 --> 5588.639
hold on to that in the afternoon like on

5587.199 --> 5591.36
the time when there's a flat earth

5588.639 --> 5593.28
debates but then the issue is everybody

5591.36 --> 5595.12
just starts rumpusing over it because

5593.28 --> 5598.08
they're all triggered

5595.12 --> 5599.599999999999
because that's what happens

5598.08 --> 5602.32
that didn't happen yesterday with

5599.6 --> 5605.6
mitchell because he just gave me a

5602.32 --> 5606.719
perfect amount of room

5605.6 --> 5610.719
so it all

5606.719 --> 5616.159
just came out smoothly without any

5610.719 --> 5618.2390000000005
like hostilities get go yeah arriving

5616.159 --> 5620.638999999999
which is something that very easily

5618.239 --> 5620.638999999999
happens

5622.88 --> 5628.4800000000005
you seem very flat today

5625.76 --> 5630.320000000001
no pun intended oh that's dishonest of

5628.48 --> 5634.239
course there's a pun intended or you

5630.32 --> 5634.239
wouldn't have said no pun intended

5636.48 --> 5640.159
that that's

5638.0 --> 5642.639
but it probably still was intended

5640.159 --> 5642.638999999999
whatever

5643.44 --> 5648.239
don't blame us for bowling triggering

5645.92 --> 5650.56
people that's his job

5648.239 --> 5650.5599999999995
true

5651.92 --> 5657.36
but effectively like he does

5654.239 --> 5660.0
get the feeling like he's not

5657.36 --> 5661.28
like he doesn't have the right to speak

5660.0 --> 5663.679
sometimes

5661.28 --> 5664.88
because everybody rumpus is over him and

5663.679 --> 5667.76
nobody

5664.88 --> 5669.76
like actually recognizes like yeah we're

5667.76 --> 5671.84
rumpusing over you we shouldn't do that

5669.76 --> 5674.08
no they'll say yeah of course we're

5671.84 --> 5675.4400000000005
rumpusing over you you did this wrong

5674.08 --> 5679.12
and that wrong and that wrong it's like

5675.44 --> 5681.199
yeah no [ __ ] dude no [ __ ]

5679.12 --> 5684.32
i'm trying to

5681.199 --> 5684.32
achieve something here

5685.28 --> 5689.759999999999
so

5687.04 --> 5693.719
but that's all fine

5689.76 --> 5693.719
it's all part of the process

5702.32 --> 5707.92
sounds like baldwin no it doesn't

5705.04 --> 5707.92
ball win

5709.119 --> 5712.44
not baldwin

5724.56 --> 5730.639
you should do a ball win show and try no

5727.28 --> 5733.44
thanks no it's extremely tiresome and

5730.639 --> 5733.4400000000005
confusing

5734.159 --> 5738.879999999999
i mean you guys might be amused

5736.88 --> 5741.76
everybody else is going to be really

5738.88 --> 5743.36
confused over that right because i do it

5741.76 --> 5746.2390000000005
too well

5743.36 --> 5746.239
i'm too real

5747.52 --> 5753.84
i'm too real about it yeah you guys that

5750.8 --> 5756.96
have been trained

5753.84 --> 5760.0
alongside me in that like how how that

5756.96 --> 5761.679
works yeah you have no problem with that

5760.0 --> 5764.159
like everybody else is going to be

5761.679 --> 5766.8
confused as [ __ ] every time i do ballwin

5764.159 --> 5770.28
and i do it high-end it really confuses

5766.8 --> 5770.28
a bunch of people

5773.44 --> 5779.599999999999
and i don't really mean to

5776.88 --> 5782.08
right i'm trying to sort of confuse

5779.6 --> 5783.92
ballers i guess by literally playing

5782.08 --> 5785.44
their game and showing them how to play

5783.92 --> 5787.679
their game even though they don't know

5785.44 --> 5790.4
it's a game but i do

5787.679 --> 5792.4800000000005
and i take it very serious

5790.4 --> 5796.08
right but i'm not trying to confuse like

5792.48 --> 5798.638999999999
flat earth is but they will be confused

5796.08 --> 5800.08
because it's like why are you making

5798.639 --> 5800.88
these good

5800.08 --> 5803.5199999999995
like

5800.88 --> 5805.84
opponent arguments

5803.52 --> 5805.84
ah

5806.0 --> 5810.84
yeah i know

5808.48 --> 5814.08
or i am doing it because i

5810.84 --> 5816.400000000001
know flat earth has one and there is

5814.08 --> 5817.76
nothing that could ever change that or

5816.4 --> 5820.719
turn that around

5817.76 --> 5821.76
could only make it a pair appear to do

5820.719 --> 5824.88
that

5821.76 --> 5827.92
could only apparently turn around

5824.88 --> 5830.8
the ball earth could only apparently win

5827.92 --> 5833.84
because it can never actually win and

5830.8 --> 5835.28
based on that trust i can

5833.84 --> 5838.400000000001
do what i do

5835.28 --> 5842.5599999999995
as far as i can

5838.4 --> 5845.759999999999
if there was actually some kind of a

5842.56 --> 5848.0
stalemate situation

5845.76 --> 5850.639
then i would never allow myself to go

5848.0 --> 5852.48
that far because then i would literally

5850.639 --> 5855.4400000000005
be handing

5852.48 --> 5858.0
the opponent weaponry that we would

5855.44 --> 5860.799999999999
suffer under but we're not because we've

5858.0 --> 5860.8
already won

5862.32 --> 5867.199
i mean i might be handing them what seem

5864.48 --> 5869.759999999999
like really sharp swords but in

5867.199 --> 5871.599999999999
actuality it's just a bunch of wooden

5869.76 --> 5874.08
toy swords

5871.6 --> 5875.280000000001
compared to the armor that we know we

5874.08 --> 5879.159
have

5875.28 --> 5879.159
that's why i can do that

5882.8 --> 5886.76
oh come on gage inspector

5900.56 --> 5907.080000000001
what

5902.48 --> 5907.08
what are you guys talking about

5921.6 --> 5926.56
this is all super confusing what no

5925.199 --> 5929.759999999999
no

5926.56 --> 5932.2390000000005
somebody interpreting balwin sounding

5929.76 --> 5934.400000000001
like alec baldwin

5932.239 --> 5939.239
is not a cue to start blabbering on

5934.4 --> 5939.239
about alec baldwin i don't care

5942.8 --> 5947.4400000000005
i don't care the guy is a complete [ __ ]

5948.48 --> 5951.879999999999
i don't care

5967.679 --> 5971.76
i don't even know who mike baldwin is

5970.0 --> 5974.239
like his brother or something ah

5971.76 --> 5976.400000000001
whatever

5974.239 --> 5978.239
uh yeah you said you were rounding out

5976.4 --> 5981.199
went off the rails

5978.239 --> 5983.759999999999
right right

5981.199 --> 5986.239
now i was kind of rounding out because

5983.76 --> 5990.1990000000005
like i'm a bit low energy but maybe now

5986.239 --> 5990.199
it's picking up or something

5997.52 --> 6002.159000000001
but a wookie rips your arm off when they

6000.32 --> 6005.92
lose

6002.159 --> 6005.92
all right let the wookie win

6006.0 --> 6009.92
wait no it says

6007.76 --> 6013.639
okay r2 new strategy

6009.92 --> 6013.639
let the wookie win

6033.44 --> 6040.159
what are my plans for later today

6037.52 --> 6043.280000000001
same as every day

6040.159 --> 6044.32
take over the world

6043.28 --> 6046.5599999999995
no

6044.32 --> 6046.5599999999995
just

6046.719 --> 6052.4
same as usual

6050.08 --> 6056.0
i'm gonna get groceries

6052.4 --> 6056.0
gonna be on the flat earth debates

6056.88 --> 6063.04
hang around watch a bunch of media stuff

6059.92 --> 6065.04
try to follow the news without

6063.04 --> 6066.719
getting dragged in too much squirty

6065.04 --> 6069.04
stuff

6066.719 --> 6069.04
and

6070.639 --> 6075.28
that's right pj grushank

6073.28 --> 6077.04
yeah and maybe get a chicken broccoli

6075.28 --> 6079.84
this evening

6077.04 --> 6079.84
in line with the

6080.8 --> 6085.84
thanksgiving tradition even though it's

6083.28 --> 6089.639
not really my local tradition here

6085.84 --> 6089.639
i still like the idea

6107.679 --> 6110.679
what

6120.56 --> 6127.320000000001
an l is a computer i have no idea what

6123.84 --> 6127.32
you're talking about

6146.719 --> 6152.44
always flatten out the show never round

6148.96 --> 6152.44
it out huh

6165.84 --> 6170.8
no i'm not gonna do flat smacking down

6168.32 --> 6173.04
in traffic lights

6170.8 --> 6173.04
no

6174.719 --> 6178.719
i mean if somebody comes up to me starts

6177.52 --> 6180.080000000001
talking

6178.719 --> 6182.2390000000005
yeah

6180.08 --> 6185.84
oh yeah but then

6182.239 --> 6188.239
they would actually have to see me

6185.84 --> 6188.2390000000005
and then

6188.84 --> 6192.8
basically want to talk to me and then

6192.0 --> 6195.04
i'll

6192.8 --> 6196.56
i'll tell them whatever i think they can

6195.04 --> 6199.84
handle

6196.56 --> 6201.04
but first they'd have to actually see me

6199.84 --> 6204.0
and then

6201.04 --> 6206.8
decide to talk to me

6204.0 --> 6206.8
some people do

6207.92 --> 6211.84
and it's like

6209.44 --> 6214.48
every single person out there

6211.84 --> 6215.92
that speaks to me just knows

6214.48 --> 6218.08
i know [ __ ]

6215.92 --> 6220.08
even though they don't know who i am

6218.08 --> 6222.159
just because of the way i look and what

6220.08 --> 6226.239
i radiate and how i look out of my eyes

6222.159 --> 6228.32
they all know they all know i'm a guy

6226.239 --> 6230.4
that knows [ __ ]

6228.32 --> 6232.08
a lot

6230.4 --> 6234.48
even though they've never talked to me

6232.08 --> 6236.08
they don't even know i have a show they

6234.48 --> 6240.159
don't even know i do that they could

6236.08 --> 6240.159
just see it on me intuitively

6245.04 --> 6249.119
which by the way for a whole bunch of

6246.639 --> 6251.04
people is a very good reason to avoid me

6249.119 --> 6254.08
like the plague because they're

6251.04 --> 6257.119
constantly hiding [ __ ] from themselves

6254.08 --> 6260.5599999999995
and they know if they face me i'm going

6257.119 --> 6262.5599999999995
to point at just that thing

6260.56 --> 6265.1990000000005
they know it they feel it that's why

6262.56 --> 6265.1990000000005
they avoid me

6267.36 --> 6271.759999999999
am i a celebrity my name

6270.48 --> 6274.759999999999
uh

6271.76 --> 6274.76
well

6274.8 --> 6278.4800000000005
what

6275.84 --> 6280.719
how does that work like nobody even

6278.48 --> 6283.599999999999
knows here that i do a show

6280.719 --> 6286.88
like i had to tell

6283.6 --> 6289.4400000000005
the guy at the coffee shop i go to

6286.88 --> 6291.84
he works there i've been going there for

6289.44 --> 6293.919999999999
like five years i've told him probably

6291.84 --> 6295.6
like three times i have a youtube show

6293.92 --> 6297.679
every day

6295.6 --> 6300.4800000000005
but he never remembers even so they

6297.679 --> 6302.4800000000005
don't even take a look

6300.48 --> 6304.879999999999
nobody cares

6302.48 --> 6307.04
not really

6304.88 --> 6311.28
they don't care enough to actually get

6307.04 --> 6313.28
involved to to directly start connecting

6311.28 --> 6314.8
but that's because everybody's kind of

6313.28 --> 6316.32
like that here

6314.8 --> 6318.56
it's like everybody's just like yeah the

6316.32 --> 6321.199
world's [ __ ] up don't get too informed

6318.56 --> 6323.360000000001
or you'll get all these nightmares

6321.199 --> 6325.919999999999
but that still means that they are out

6323.36 --> 6328.159
looking for people that when [ __ ] gets

6325.92 --> 6330.8
really

6328.159 --> 6332.799999999999
out of control they're going to be

6330.8 --> 6334.719
looking for okay who knows who

6332.8 --> 6336.400000000001
understands this who knows what the [ __ ]

6334.719 --> 6338.2390000000005
is going on i've been ignoring

6336.4 --> 6341.92
everything for too long because it's

6338.239 --> 6341.919999999999
just we can't survive this

6343.119 --> 6349.199
i think that's going on a lot it's very

6345.92 --> 6349.1990000000005
typical dutch by the way

6350.159 --> 6355.5199999999995
always find your your right sources for

6353.04 --> 6357.5199999999995
information if you don't want to be that

6355.52 --> 6361.679
source of information

6357.52 --> 6361.679
do your roommates watch your show no

6364.48 --> 6369.678999999999
i don't think so if they did they're not

6367.119 --> 6369.679
telling me

6370.719 --> 6378.8
but beside my show i talk to them

6376.0 --> 6381.76
i get rolled up in conversations i

6378.8 --> 6383.6
subjects come up i kind of forcibly

6381.76 --> 6386.719
inform them

6383.6 --> 6389.4400000000005
i keep reminding them yes

6386.719 --> 6391.679
that disease supposedly happening is

6389.44 --> 6393.839999999999
complete hoax

6391.679 --> 6396.0
and i keep reminding them how

6393.84 --> 6398.56
and i also keep reminding them that the

6396.0 --> 6400.56
establishment doesn't care

6398.56 --> 6403.280000000001
even if you know they're just going to

6400.56 --> 6405.76
keep on forcing that program

6403.28 --> 6406.639
and people will buy into it

6405.76 --> 6410.76
and make

6406.639 --> 6410.76
and make them aware of that

6414.239 --> 6419.119
so i do have plenty of conversations

6416.8 --> 6422.320000000001
outside of my show

6419.119 --> 6425.04
with roommate with the roommates

6422.32 --> 6428.32
about all kinds of things

6425.04 --> 6430.239
including their interests

6428.32 --> 6431.92
whether it's artistic

6430.239 --> 6433.5199999999995
socializing

6431.92 --> 6435.52
or medical

6433.52 --> 6438.2390000000005
right

6435.52 --> 6439.84
i can say something

6438.239 --> 6441.5199999999995
about the field

6439.84 --> 6444.400000000001
whatever it is

6441.52 --> 6444.400000000001
and contribute

6445.92 --> 6449.6
and learn stuff

6447.44 --> 6452.159
right because they are also in that

6449.6 --> 6454.08
sense my eyes and ears out there

6452.159 --> 6458.4
they are perceiving things they are

6454.08 --> 6458.4
absorbing information and feelings

6459.119 --> 6464.5599999999995
they're like samples

6461.04 --> 6467.5199999999995
for me to read and reflect on like what

6464.56 --> 6470.719
is the real out there situation what is

6467.52 --> 6473.360000000001
the atmosphere like through them because

6470.719 --> 6475.199
i'm not a person that just constantly

6473.36 --> 6477.04
walks into buildings full of people and

6475.199 --> 6479.28
their activities like i don't go to a

6477.04 --> 6480.239
school

6479.28 --> 6482.8
but

6480.239 --> 6485.04
somebody does go to a school then

6482.8 --> 6486.719
through them

6485.04 --> 6489.199
i can sample

6486.719 --> 6491.52
what the dynamics are out there

6489.199 --> 6493.678999999999
through their honest reflection even if

6491.52 --> 6496.320000000001
they don't understand what they've

6493.679 --> 6497.28
perceived i can still figure it out

6496.32 --> 6500.4
through

6497.28 --> 6500.4
what they perceived

6500.8 --> 6505.92
i just assimilate their sensory data

6504.0 --> 6507.52
even though they don't know what to do

6505.92 --> 6509.76
with it

6507.52 --> 6509.76
right

6510.32 --> 6514.08
there's no side effects of that by the

6512.08 --> 6517.44
way don't worry

6514.08 --> 6517.44
but i'm rounding out the show

6518.96 --> 6522.88
it's been all over the place

6523.84 --> 6527.84
kind of

6524.84 --> 6530.32
messy a bit slow on my side i'm sorry

6527.84 --> 6530.32
about that

6533.44 --> 6536.638999999999
and you guys are just talking all over

6535.6 --> 6538.320000000001
the place

6536.639 --> 6540.719
it's kind of hard to keep track of what

6538.32 --> 6543.44
you're talking about

6540.719 --> 6546.639
right so thanks everyone for coming i

6543.44 --> 6549.759999999999
