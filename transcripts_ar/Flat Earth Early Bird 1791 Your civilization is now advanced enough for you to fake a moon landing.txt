[Music]

418.4 --> 421.4
computer

427.16 --> 430.52000000000004
what the hell's going on

448.319 --> 451.319
here

457.16 --> 462.319
Jesus

458.759 --> 466.36
okay I don't know exactly why but OBS is

462.319 --> 469.52000000000004
like totally sucking up like 60% of my

466.36 --> 473.24
processor time and for what I don't get

469.52 --> 473.24
it it's acting

477.28 --> 485.87899999999996
weird right how am I doing today I'm

481.36 --> 490.8
okay I'm a little bit wonky I don't know

485.879 --> 490.8
why but I got up pretty late for my

492.919 --> 498.96
doing but still yeah I mean I'm only a

496.12 --> 503.639
half hour late today

498.96 --> 506.039
so I got up like 15 before

503.639 --> 508.24
1 but I mean I did have a pretty good

506.039 --> 511.24
sleep

508.24 --> 511.24
and

513.44 --> 518.2790000000001
yeah I don't know I just have been of

515.76 --> 518.279
startup

518.8 --> 524.68
issues get more focused I have an

521.08 --> 528.6
Illuminati on here too as soon as I stop

524.68 --> 528.5999999999999
feeling wonky I'm going to bite down on

532.519 --> 535.519
it

536.16 --> 541.8389999999999
yeah but yeah overall I'm doing good but

539.32 --> 545.1600000000001
I mean I am like really worrying about

541.839 --> 545.1600000000001
my money situation

545.32 --> 549.24
because yeah obvious

551.16 --> 555.399
reasons I hope to you

555.48 --> 559.0
guys obvious at

557.31 --> 561.399
[Music]

559.0 --> 563.959
least right and then in the back of my

561.399 --> 566.6
mind I'm like really worrying about what

563.959 --> 568.5189999999999
happened on Sunday like oh my God like

566.6 --> 570.5600000000001
are people not going to support me now

568.519 --> 573.16
and all that

570.56 --> 576.079
right that sort of thing low fruit like

573.16 --> 579.56
sent me a message like I'm not following

576.079 --> 579.56
you anymore because of that

580.72 --> 586.76
apparently which is

583.959 --> 589.68
weird I did kind of have a bit of a

586.76 --> 589.68
suspicion about

590.839 --> 597.6400000000001
him but uh yeah so I'm a bit

595.21 --> 601.12
[Music]

597.64 --> 601.12
worried troll

606.72 --> 611.36
what happen son

608.68 --> 615.64
oh wow you say Troll and immediately

611.36 --> 615.64
Aries 106 shows up that that is

616.92 --> 623.0
telling

618.6 --> 624.9200000000001
Uh Oh you mean the low fruit guy yeah no

623.0 --> 626.72
I think that he was I was kind of

624.92 --> 630.5999999999999
waiting for him to like pop out of the

626.72 --> 633.5600000000001
Shadows like odds and the rest of them

630.6 --> 640.0790000000001
but apparently he chose to like

633.56 --> 640.079
oh just Retreat cuz I felt already like

645.04 --> 651.399
yeah what reason big big he was not

649.2 --> 654.72
specific it was just like you went too

651.399 --> 657.16
far against flat so and don't want to so

654.72 --> 658.9200000000001
[ __ ] anymore something like that I am

657.16 --> 662.16
paraphrasing I don't remember exactly

658.92 --> 662.16
what what he said it was just like in

662.8 --> 666.04
a

664.76 --> 668.6
[Music]

666.04 --> 672.68
which might have been like the QE live

668.6 --> 674.48
chat no wait it was in fed live oh and I

672.68 --> 677.4799999999999
banned

674.48 --> 677.48
him

684.0 --> 687.959
there thought it was just an absurd

686.399 --> 690.959
thing to

687.959 --> 690.959
do

695.56 --> 700.6389999999999
right but what happened Aries a if you

698.12 --> 704.04
want to know what happened then watch

700.639 --> 706.519
the beginning half hour or

704.04 --> 708.56
something of my show

706.519 --> 711.16
yesterday I'm not going to go through

708.56 --> 711.16
all of that

712.32 --> 718.32
again have I ever shot an arrow from

715.48 --> 720.2
that weapon that that weapon is called a

718.32 --> 723.8000000000001
bow

720.2 --> 726.9590000000001
yes and yes I have shot an arrow from

723.8 --> 729.3599999999999
that bow the arrows that hang right

726.959 --> 729.3599999999999
beside

737.88 --> 745.56
it Archer is

740.92 --> 745.56
relaxing I'm not making a habit out of

747.88 --> 752.519
it

749.839 --> 754.6
it's with archery I like the idea of it

752.519 --> 756.04
and it's like oh we're going to go to

754.6 --> 759.32
some kind of

756.04 --> 762.079
affair and there's a guy with a bow that

759.32 --> 764.7600000000001
lets people like shoot the bow then I'm

762.079 --> 767.5999999999999
like yeah then I want to do it but I'm

764.76 --> 769.639
not like oh I'm an Archer and I'm going

767.6 --> 773.5600000000001
to go outside and do

769.639 --> 776.8
Archer I'm I'm find that I don't know I

773.56 --> 779.5189999999999
find it's weird I find it

776.8 --> 780.959
embarrassing it's like oh look at at me

779.519 --> 784.44
shooting a

780.959 --> 784.4399999999999
bow I I don't

789.92 --> 794.76
know it's like if I'm going to do

792.639 --> 796.6800000000001
archery it's going to be pretty much in

794.76 --> 798.959
public of course since it's going to be

796.68 --> 800.3199999999999
outside and then people are going to be

798.959 --> 803.1199999999999
watching and I'm

800.32 --> 805.9590000000001
like yeah I don't want to be thinking

803.12 --> 809.839
about people watching me while I do that

805.959 --> 813.2399999999999
unless it's like on a Renaissance fair

809.839 --> 817.0400000000001
right cu no like there's so much to look

813.24 --> 817.04
at like nobody cares

826.519 --> 832.32
there but yeah I suspect like even in

829.92 --> 835.0
the future it will probably become like

832.32 --> 837.759
a bit of a hobby of mine but I'm never

835.0 --> 842.44
going to be like all QE about

837.759 --> 844.639
it I'm not like one bow one kill like oh

842.44 --> 846.2790000000001
the perfect shot I'm not I like I don't

844.639 --> 850.44
care about

846.279 --> 853.32
that I'm just amazed by it's a bow and

850.44 --> 855.6
it can work and you can like purely on

853.32 --> 855.6
your

855.8 --> 863.3199999999999
intuition just

858.399 --> 863.32
like I got to hit that and then just

863.519 --> 869.199
like just estimate the arc and it's all

866.56 --> 871.279
intuition and one

869.199 --> 874.0
it's like it's not even like learning

871.279 --> 876.48
how to do it it's just like learning on

874.0 --> 879.0
how to get your intuition on the right

876.48 --> 881.639
frequency so that you estimate it

879.0 --> 885.16
perfectly every single time and it is

881.639 --> 887.519
possible it's like ATT tuning yourself

885.16 --> 887.519
to the

887.88 --> 893.279
bow and I've had those moments in the

890.8 --> 896.959
where because like once you actually a

893.279 --> 899.48
tune like real serious magic starts to

896.959 --> 902.1199999999999
happen because then

899.48 --> 904.48
or it has with me like when I properly

902.12 --> 908.44
get a tune like really get the feel for

904.48 --> 912.0790000000001
it then suddenly I can do crazy

908.44 --> 914.639
shots like I'll do like oh let me hit

912.079 --> 917.4399999999999
that thing like way far away and then

914.639 --> 920.36
like never attempted a shot like that

917.44 --> 921.5600000000001
and it'll just freaking hit or or right

920.36 --> 925.04
beside

921.56 --> 927.4799999999999
it when it's like a crazy

925.04 --> 928.68
shot and I've never even attempted that

927.48 --> 930.0790000000001
before it's like that's what happened

928.68 --> 933.04
happens when I really get attuned with

930.079 --> 937.56
it but I mean last time I even tried it

933.04 --> 937.56
like 20 years ago or something like

943.04 --> 948.199
yeah I used to have like especially my

945.839 --> 949.759
20s way more of a push on the inside

948.199 --> 952.3599999999999
like oh you want to go out you would

949.759 --> 954.1990000000001
just want to do something I don't have

952.36 --> 956.399
it that strongly

954.199 --> 959.0
anymore back then it would like really

956.399 --> 962.199
make me miserable like if I just chose

959.0 --> 964.72
to stay inside so like it forced me to

962.199 --> 967.319
like go out and just do something just

964.72 --> 969.0
anything no matter

967.319 --> 971.519
what

969.0 --> 974.24
now I don't know I've really kind of

971.519 --> 974.24
turned into a

975.04 --> 981.8399999999999
Hermit but I I do

978.0 --> 983.639
miss doing stuff sounds weird

981.84 --> 986.88
[Music]

983.639 --> 989.24
right it's not like I Hate Everything I

986.88 --> 991.56
just don't want to do nothing no no it's

989.24 --> 991.5600000000001
just

993.44 --> 997.0790000000001
that this is what's

997.55 --> 1002.4799999999999
[Music]

998.88 --> 1005.92
happening and I just really don't like

1002.48 --> 1005.9200000000001
cold and all

1006.12 --> 1013.04
that and it is pretty cold whoa so clear

1010.279 --> 1014.8
the sky cleared really up cleared up

1013.04 --> 1019.279
look at

1014.8 --> 1022.5999999999999
this it's nice and nice and blue

1019.279 --> 1022.6
happens very quickly

1025.16 --> 1029.0790000000002
right I mean 15

1038.199 --> 1044.72
minutes you're a fan of compound bones

1041.199 --> 1047.4
bows yeah this is a compound

1044.72 --> 1050.4
bow oldfashioned

1047.4 --> 1050.4
Style

1051.48 --> 1056.24
but it's a bit of a cheater because it

1053.28 --> 1059.6789999999999
actually has like glass fiber in

1056.24 --> 1062.039
it and it just works amazingly it's like

1059.679 --> 1064.72
the material they didn't have in those

1062.039 --> 1067.72
times cuz the design is super

1064.72 --> 1071.24
basic but it has like glass fiber in the

1067.72 --> 1074.6000000000001
flex part which makes it like

1071.24 --> 1074.6
really just

1075.36 --> 1080.0
amazing but it does feel like yeah I got

1077.799 --> 1082.48
a real old oldfashioned bow like from

1080.0 --> 1084.36
how they made it in medieval times but

1082.48 --> 1088.44
they cheated it because I got a piece

1084.36 --> 1088.4399999999998
that's actually glass fiber instead of

1097.84 --> 1105.3999999999999
wood or glass fire it's some type of

1102.2 --> 1107.28
like what do you call it it might be

1105.4 --> 1110.3200000000002
glass I don't know exactly what that

1107.28 --> 1110.32
stuff is it's not

1111.48 --> 1116.08
exposed like there's leather covering

1113.76 --> 1119.1589999999999
over it

1116.08 --> 1123.559
anyway modern bows feel like cheat mode

1119.159 --> 1126.5590000000002
well yeah those freaking professional

1123.559 --> 1130.48
sports bows like QE uses I mean that's

1126.559 --> 1130.48
just like that's not a freaking

1131.44 --> 1140.3200000000002
bow that's just a hand

1134.32 --> 1140.32
turret that happens to still use

1140.64 --> 1146.2800000000002
like bow propelling or it's just

1143.799 --> 1148.6
ridiculous doesn't look like a bow it's

1146.28 --> 1152.52
clunky as [ __ ] you can't put those

1148.6 --> 1155.1589999999999
things down without risking breaking

1152.52 --> 1157.36
something like like how are you going to

1155.159 --> 1159.24
quickly put that thing on your back with

1157.36 --> 1161.52
all those [ __ ] things sticking out

1159.24 --> 1161.52
it's

1167.24 --> 1170.24
ridiculous

1173.28 --> 1178.76
yeah laugh it up Aries 106 hand to it

1175.919 --> 1178.76
but it kind of

1180.84 --> 1184.3999999999999
is carbon

1185.2 --> 1194.32
fiber yeah something like that

1189.52 --> 1194.32
Tommy it has like this yellowish white

1197.24 --> 1200.24
look

1201.919 --> 1206.24
but it's like pretty tough and flexible

1205.2 --> 1209.6000000000001
it's

1206.24 --> 1211.919
like you can't break that stuff you can

1209.6 --> 1214.3999999999999
put a lot of tension on it and even like

1211.919 --> 1218.1200000000001
twist it but it just won't

1214.4 --> 1218.1200000000001
break it's very

1227.159 --> 1232.1200000000001
stdy funny because it's true you're

1230.44 --> 1235.19
right

1232.12 --> 1235.1899999999998
[Music]

1250.799 --> 1257.08
yeah and yeah by the way it's also like

1253.84 --> 1258.6399999999999
I think it's cold season again it's

1257.08 --> 1261.72
really funny because

1258.64 --> 1267.2
oh no cold season I'll

1261.72 --> 1269.159
get slightly flamy throats and weird

1267.2 --> 1271.559
voice

1269.159 --> 1274.24
flops that's

1271.559 --> 1275.84
it that's the problems that's the extent

1274.24 --> 1277.919
of the problems I get but I mean I'm

1275.84 --> 1281.76
hearing a lot of people out there like

1277.919 --> 1281.76
coughing and [ __ ] all over the

1282.12 --> 1289.08
place sneezing not so much I tend to

1286.32 --> 1291.76
sneeze more really but yeah when happens

1289.08 --> 1294.32
during the show I mute the cam cuz I

1291.76 --> 1297.44
don't want to have a

1294.32 --> 1301.48
psychosomatic Echo out there of

1297.44 --> 1301.48
that don't want to distract

1303.32 --> 1308.839
you but it is going

1305.77 --> 1308.839
[Music]

1313.07 --> 1316.109
[Music]

1317.039 --> 1320.039
around

1321.84 --> 1331.6
right but don't be afraid it's all

1326.72 --> 1334.52
natural don't be afraid it's all

1331.6 --> 1339.32
natural it's all part of what happens

1334.52 --> 1339.32
all part of the biological cycle you go

1342.32 --> 1349.6399999999999
through and it might sound kind of weird

1346.36 --> 1352.279
but if you can be strong enough to

1349.64 --> 1355.4
actually embrace

1352.279 --> 1358.679
it so that you don't

1355.4 --> 1361.039
panic don't do make rash decisions all

1358.679 --> 1362.799
those kinds of things then it's just

1361.039 --> 1366.48
like disease is

1362.799 --> 1368.84
nothing it's so doable I mean yeah it's

1366.48 --> 1370.64
really discomfortable and yeah it can be

1368.84 --> 1373.6399999999999
very

1370.64 --> 1373.64
inconvenient

1375.36 --> 1378.7199999999998
but I

1376.96 --> 1385.52
mean

1378.72 --> 1385.52
the like I'm not paranoid about sickness

1387.32 --> 1394.1589999999999
anymore like I'm much more afraid to

1390.88 --> 1396.279
like get caught up in something where

1394.159 --> 1398.24
people that are paranoid about these

1396.279 --> 1400.52
things will just make these it's like I

1398.24 --> 1402.08
get in an accident it never happens by

1400.52 --> 1404.559
the way it has never happened it never

1402.08 --> 1408.36
will happen but still in my

1404.559 --> 1410.1589999999999
mind the idea of it like I get like in

1408.36 --> 1411.9189999999999
like let's say I'm in a bus or something

1410.159 --> 1414.48
and the bus gets in an accident and I

1411.919 --> 1416.1200000000001
get knocked out and then I just wake up

1414.48 --> 1418.039
in the hospital and like they put all

1416.12 --> 1420.0
kind of stuff in me like that's

1418.039 --> 1421.52
something I kind of

1420.0 --> 1425.52
fear

1421.52 --> 1429.08
right but like me oh no was like I got a

1425.52 --> 1431.08
bit of breathing trouble it's like yeah

1429.08 --> 1434.4399999999998
okay well then okay then I got a bit of

1431.08 --> 1436.96
breathing trouble like don't make huge

1434.44 --> 1439.44
effort and especially Don't Panic I'm

1436.96 --> 1442.48
like yeah okay it's very

1439.44 --> 1445.0800000000002
uncomfortable okay sucks for a bit

1442.48 --> 1448.3600000000001
doable it's all doable like whatever I'm

1445.08 --> 1452.24
going to get like and even toothache not

1448.36 --> 1454.6
that I please don't come back but I mean

1452.24 --> 1458.36
it sucks it's like

1454.6 --> 1461.8799999999999
a headache or I can't focus or even to a

1458.36 --> 1466.399
fever level but it's still like

1461.88 --> 1469.0800000000002
yep well that's at least like over like

1466.399 --> 1472.36
you know that really only happens one

1469.08 --> 1472.36
time per

1474.36 --> 1479.76
tooth I don't

1477.0 --> 1482.48
know because it's like every

1479.76 --> 1484.84
time you just think like oh oh the

1482.48 --> 1488.1200000000001
system can fix it very quickly for your

1484.84 --> 1490.08
medical system or something it's like oh

1488.12 --> 1492.0
yeah yeah oh oh yes of course they'll do

1490.08 --> 1496.32
it and then you have a massive

1492.0 --> 1498.799
Bill and then it turns out it like yeah

1496.32 --> 1500.559
it'll come back or it just get it again

1498.799 --> 1503.279
and and then like what the [ __ ] did you

1500.559 --> 1506.8799999999999
spend all that for what did they do to

1503.279 --> 1509.36
your body like sometimes like just

1506.88 --> 1512.0390000000002
operating and the drugs they use for

1509.36 --> 1515.6789999999999
that can just like change things about

1512.039 --> 1518.1589999999999
you how you work all of a sudden it's

1515.679 --> 1520.3600000000001
like they literally don't know what

1518.159 --> 1520.3600000000001
they're

1520.799 --> 1525.96
doing the alpath medicine people in a

1524.48 --> 1530.6
way

1525.96 --> 1530.6000000000001
like they're so that were so

1532.399 --> 1538.36
rushed this just this devastating set of

1536.399 --> 1542.32
side effects that have long-term

1538.36 --> 1545.559
consequences that they don't even know

1542.32 --> 1547.799
about they're not even like registering

1545.559 --> 1550.0
that part you're just going to have to

1547.799 --> 1550.96
find out for yourself after you've gone

1550.0 --> 1553.96
through

1550.96 --> 1553.96
it

1556.679 --> 1559.679
right

1564.48 --> 1572.559
oh that happened to you teret

1566.919 --> 1574.5590000000002
o right yeah well fortunately I I have a

1572.559 --> 1576.799
sense for these things I can see

1574.559 --> 1579.6789999999999
accidents coming that thereby preventing

1576.799 --> 1584.039
it or like the thing

1579.679 --> 1588.039
is the biggest damage in an accident is

1584.039 --> 1590.559
done in any form when it's complete

1588.039 --> 1593.279
unexpected when the impact or something

1590.559 --> 1597.399
happened and you did not see it coming

1593.279 --> 1599.6
you could not brace right that's often

1597.399 --> 1603.039
like unless like you're it's a frontal

1599.6 --> 1605.9189999999999
and you like have a proper back cushion

1603.039 --> 1608.799
for your head to absorb the like that

1605.919 --> 1610.6000000000001
helps but it's like if you're just like

1608.799 --> 1612.6399999999999
sitting in a bus or something you get

1610.6 --> 1616.6
hit and you didn't see it coming then

1612.64 --> 1618.64
boom then it's like you get [ __ ] up by

1616.6 --> 1622.6
that

1618.64 --> 1625.2
but because I'm paranoid and have a

1622.6 --> 1628.48
sense it's like a spider sense for

1625.2 --> 1630.8400000000001
accidents like even if something happens

1628.48 --> 1633.44
and it has happened like I have had cars

1630.84 --> 1635.48
that like drove right right into the bus

1633.44 --> 1637.559
that I was driving in that I was sitting

1635.48 --> 1640.039
in although I was sitting in like a back

1637.559 --> 1643.6399999999999
seat which is very high so you never get

1640.039 --> 1645.279
hit luckily but like the impact was

1643.64 --> 1647.76
pretty severe and there were people that

1645.279 --> 1651.679
had like hurt necks and all that out of

1647.76 --> 1655.48
that but I freaking saw it coming so I

1651.679 --> 1658.279
was like oh and that way it's like yeah

1655.48 --> 1661.2
I I had absolutely no issues because

1658.279 --> 1663.32
every time something happen the damage

1661.2 --> 1665.8400000000001
is really done because you didn't see it

1663.32 --> 1669.36
coming and you didn't brace for it

1665.84 --> 1671.6399999999999
properly right cuz it's unexpected and

1669.36 --> 1673.519
something just twists or something right

1671.64 --> 1676.519
it gets

1673.519 --> 1679.519
pulled because you didn't

1676.519 --> 1679.519
brace

1681.679 --> 1686.44
so it's like yeah because I had like I

1684.279 --> 1689.64
went got into like sort of an accident

1686.44 --> 1692.44
one time not me behind the wheel but it

1689.64 --> 1692.44
was like with my

1692.48 --> 1697.1200000000001
parents my parents were behind the wheel

1695.279 --> 1699.08
they were kind of

1697.12 --> 1702.279
bickering and

1699.08 --> 1704.519
then I think they like accidentally

1702.279 --> 1706.279
drove a red light or something

1704.519 --> 1708.2
accidentally cuz they were just

1706.279 --> 1710.24
distracted which is stupid

1708.2 --> 1712.44
and then another car like drove it into

1710.24 --> 1716.559
our sight but not full on or anything it

1712.44 --> 1719.44
wasn't like a highspeed smash but still

1716.559 --> 1721.6
like I saw that coming even then it was

1719.44 --> 1724.3600000000001
like oh I see a light approaching

1721.6 --> 1727.32
Instinct it's like light bright and then

1724.36 --> 1729.7199999999998
you know oh [ __ ] that could mean

1727.32 --> 1731.2
impact right especially when it's from a

1729.72 --> 1733.32
certain angle when you're in the car

1731.2 --> 1736.2
it's like you shouldn't see it growing

1733.32 --> 1739.0
brighter from that angle from the front

1736.2 --> 1741.72
approaching like that that's bad

1739.0 --> 1744.039
news so I felt it come because it was

1741.72 --> 1746.96
like in the dark

1744.039 --> 1750.8799999999999
too that was

1746.96 --> 1752.2
like 11 or something when that happened

1750.88 --> 1755.1200000000001
like one

1752.2 --> 1756.919
time and we had silly situation where

1755.12 --> 1758.9189999999999
somebody would like bump into the back

1756.919 --> 1760.88
of us or something but that just like

1758.919 --> 1763.44
from standing still almost that's not

1760.88 --> 1766.3200000000002
really an accident it's just a nuisance

1763.44 --> 1769.2
but an actual hit that happened like one

1766.32 --> 1773.8799999999999
time

1769.2 --> 1777.0
on a on a crossing of a like a road

1773.88 --> 1779.6000000000001
where you can drive 80 and all that not

1777.0 --> 1784.919
like in the middle of a city or a

1779.6 --> 1788.36
town and then that happened right but

1784.919 --> 1792.0
like anytime it happens I like I just

1788.36 --> 1794.6
see it coming I never ever have damage

1792.0 --> 1794.6
from it

1796.32 --> 1799.32
ever

1809.96 --> 1817.48
about it 12 around that week I said to

1814.36 --> 1820.32
you I do remember that you told me that

1817.48 --> 1822.3990000000001
yeah that you woke up like what the [ __ ]

1820.32 --> 1825.0
I do remember that D that you told me

1822.399 --> 1829.0
that's a while ago yeah you seem to be

1825.0 --> 1831.96
okay though after that

1829.0 --> 1831.96
but yeah that sounds

1833.159 --> 1837.0390000000002
freaky sounded freaky I

1844.08 --> 1848.76
mean that's why it's called practicing

1852.279 --> 1861.12
medicine oh right yes teret yeah I yeah

1857.72 --> 1863.3600000000001
you didn't you I remember now sorry it's

1861.12 --> 1865.8799999999999
not as long as ago as long ago as I

1863.36 --> 1867.0
thought yeah that was like a week ago or

1865.88 --> 1869.679
something

1867.0 --> 1872.679
right the bus that you were going to be

1869.679 --> 1872.679
in

1878.559 --> 1883.08
crashed right and you were all puzzled

1880.919 --> 1883.0800000000002
about

1886.159 --> 1891.2
it

1888.399 --> 1891.1999999999998
round

right that's when clutch told me to see

1909.159 --> 1915.679
final Destin this is just a terrible

1912.6 --> 1918.399
recommendation if you just avoided an

1915.679 --> 1919.6000000000001
accident or something you don't need to

1918.399 --> 1921.4399999999998
watch Final

[Music]

1921.44 --> 1929.3600000000001
destinations this kind of sucks anyway I

1923.96 --> 1929.3600000000001
mean it's kind of a trashy horror movie

1930.36 --> 1935.36
franchise yeah dark comedy but I mean

1933.24 --> 1939.24
that's kind of

1935.36 --> 1942.1999999999998
trashy anything that's just like doesn't

1939.24 --> 1946.08
give a [ __ ] about human life for the

1942.2 --> 1949.0800000000002
giggles is like trash

1946.08 --> 1949.08

1970.679 --> 1974.6000000000001
them did they make

1972.96 --> 1978.6000000000001
more

1974.6 --> 1981.559
Jesus well yeah whatever

1978.6 --> 1981.559
hello orino

1983.559 --> 1987.76
wumble I'm going to dig in my Illuminati

1986.32 --> 1991.96
cuz I'm getting kind of hungry and it's

1987.76 --> 1991.96
going to get cold cheers

2005.96 --> 2008.96
everyone

2025.919 --> 2029.3600000000001
but I mean

2032.0 --> 2038.159
so I think you could compare Final

2035.96 --> 2042.799
Destination

2038.159 --> 2042.7990000000002
series franchise a little bit with like

2044.919 --> 2049.799
Hellraisers which has also become quite

2051.32 --> 2057.2400000000002
trashy but I mean like those first two

2054.399 --> 2060.5989999999997
especially the second was just like

2057.24 --> 2063.04
whoa that was like really epic and

2060.599 --> 2065.8790000000004
trippy and now it's just like oh the

2063.04 --> 2067.919
boogeyman Hellraiser

2065.879 --> 2071.0789999999997
themed

2067.919 --> 2075.04
it with like the dumbest

2071.079 --> 2078.04
[ __ ] and Final Destination I mean

2075.04 --> 2081.72
yeah it's not exactly

2078.04 --> 2084.119
become like better acted or anything

2081.72 --> 2084.1189999999997
over

2095.879 --> 2098.879
time

2111.88 --> 2116.2000000000003
anyway uh we're talking about movies

2119.92 --> 2123.7200000000003
now how did we get

2125.8 --> 2128.8
here

2133.599 --> 2138.8
yeah the conversation just

2136.24 --> 2140.2
migrated

2138.8 --> 2144.8390000000004
[Music]

2140.2 --> 2144.839
just from one bit of a subject to

2152.359 --> 2158.7999999999997
another uh right see what can we talk

2155.96 --> 2158.8
about

2159.72 --> 2163.56
FL Earth the B yesterday was

2166.48 --> 2171.04
cool was not very active in it

2175.04 --> 2179.7599999999998
though oh and it seems like

2177.72 --> 2183.52
RI

2179.76 --> 2186.1600000000003
0000000000 Z is now completely total

2183.52 --> 2188.4
troll anti flat earther that even uses

2186.16 --> 2190.359
the typical

2188.4 --> 2194.48
imagery for

2190.359 --> 2197.319
that so that's apparently

2194.48 --> 2200.599
that oh and I got angry comment from her

2197.319 --> 2205.44
about oh you're so mean floid like what

2200.599 --> 2205.44
the [ __ ] are you waffling on about

2212.68 --> 2218.68
woman so that's going

2215.68 --> 2218.68
on

2224.24 --> 2230.359
I mean did you see that even the title

2226.24 --> 2230.359
for our latest video is like

2231.92 --> 2234.92
yeah

2237.68 --> 2243.64
really it's social

2241.64 --> 2246.44
pressure

2243.64 --> 2250.56
uh well social pressure happens all the

2246.44 --> 2252.96
time that's not really an excuse to just

2250.56 --> 2255.64
completely flip-flop and turn into like

2252.96 --> 2255.64
the worst

2256.0 --> 2263.24
ever that's just being called having

2259.76 --> 2263.2400000000002
no having no

2266.88 --> 2275.599
roots being easily manipulated to just

2271.96 --> 2278.599
shift into something

2275.599 --> 2278.599
else

2297.8 --> 2304.7200000000003
should have known about how to

2301.119 --> 2307.52
teret he literally left flattering

2304.72 --> 2310.5989999999997
comments on anti me

2307.52 --> 2312.359
videos should have known he knew it he

2310.599 --> 2314.56
was watching the freaking video what do

2312.359 --> 2314.56
you

2315.8 --> 2321.7200000000003
think and I don't think it's money

2317.88 --> 2324.48
pressure either I just think it's like

2321.72 --> 2326.4399999999996
yeah I'm not going to be told what

2324.48 --> 2329.2
friends I hang around with I think it's

2326.44 --> 2333.599
that kind of [ __ ] he's just like no I

2329.2 --> 2338.52
don't care you don't tell me what to

2333.599 --> 2338.52
do okay well hang around with trash

2338.72 --> 2343.72
get

2340.72 --> 2343.72
smelly

2359.96 --> 2366.8
huh was just giving yeah terod no that's

2362.92 --> 2368.359
fine dude I I kind of liked RA in the I

2366.8 --> 2372.0
just thought like oh it's like a woman

2368.359 --> 2375.119
is just like trying to figure it out

2372.0 --> 2376.96
and like had bit of trouble getting grip

2375.119 --> 2380.0
on things and all that but it was like

2376.96 --> 2380.0
yeah well at least they're

2380.4 --> 2385.88
trying but then she just like would get

2383.52 --> 2388.079
like oh somebody's going like Dell

2385.88 --> 2390.04
started on about his nonsense about

2388.079 --> 2392.7200000000003
upward moving

2390.04 --> 2395.7599999999998
Earth and she's just like oh yeah that

2392.72 --> 2398.64
is the thing that's the new thing like

2395.76 --> 2402.2000000000003
why don't you explain that and just like

2398.64 --> 2405.72
what the she

2402.2 --> 2407.96
just she's taking the course she's

2405.72 --> 2411.9199999999996
learning the

2407.96 --> 2415.4
material but she doesn't get the

2411.92 --> 2419.119
material so she's like learning it

2415.4 --> 2421.64
repeating it but she doesn't understand

2419.119 --> 2421.6400000000003
what it all

2422.24 --> 2428.1189999999997
means like that's my conclusion I think

2426.64 --> 2430.92
is just

2428.119 --> 2433.52
like doesn't have the talent to

2430.92 --> 2433.52
understand these

2439.56 --> 2444.359
things because if you understood these

2442.359 --> 2448.839
things you wouldn't

2444.359 --> 2451.7599999999998
just take these positions that you only

2448.839 --> 2454.7999999999997
take these positions if you really don't

2451.76 --> 2454.8
understand what you're dealing

2455.319 --> 2458.319
with

2465.68 --> 2471.2799999999997
that she doesn't

2467.68 --> 2474.72
yes it's like you can reason out why in

2471.28 --> 2477.88
front of her it will like she will pick

2474.72 --> 2479.839
up on it like oh that seems like a solid

2477.88 --> 2483.04
fluid

2479.839 --> 2485.24
reasoning seems like they're confident

2483.04 --> 2486.839
about what they're

2485.24 --> 2489.359
saying

2486.839 --> 2492.0789999999997
but she doesn't get it she doesn't

2489.359 --> 2496.2
actually understand the material

2492.079 --> 2500.6400000000003
itself she's like a socialite that's

2496.2 --> 2504.319
like using her feminine perhaps social

2500.64 --> 2507.4
skills to like

2504.319 --> 2510.56
navigate and like try to fish through

2507.4 --> 2512.28
that I think because it just seems like

2510.56 --> 2515.24
you could put a piece of reasoning on

2512.28 --> 2518.1600000000003
her and she would even repeat

2515.24 --> 2520.3999999999996
it even in the moment be able to point

2518.16 --> 2523.8799999999997
things out but then it like it doesn't

2520.4 --> 2527.079
stick the implications don't sink

2523.88 --> 2529.359
in every time that's what I noticed

2527.079 --> 2529.3590000000004
about

2530.76 --> 2537.6800000000003
here it was like that from the beginning

2533.4 --> 2540.04
and I think that she just got tagged by

2537.68 --> 2542.359
the anti flat earthers and all that and

2540.04 --> 2544.04
they just like got her tentacles on her

2542.359 --> 2545.96
and they're not letting go and she's

2544.04 --> 2547.24
just basically just being like oh this

2545.96 --> 2548.28
is what you got to do this is what you

2547.24 --> 2551.68
got to do

2548.28 --> 2554.119
and she's just being

2551.68 --> 2558.0
in was like

2554.119 --> 2561.4
a anti Flat Earth puppet being

2558.0 --> 2563.76
puppeted from those same background guys

2561.4 --> 2565.52
that used to send people over to the

2563.76 --> 2568.44
Flat Earth debate to debate and then had

2565.52 --> 2571.079
a little ear in right with those people

2568.44 --> 2574.599
I think that she's now she's like the

2571.079 --> 2578.1600000000003
newest performer for them so she's

2574.599 --> 2578.1600000000003
trying it

2579.44 --> 2583.8
ra is coming out as an anti Flat Earth

2583.839 --> 2591.149
puppet that's what I think all right

2588.01 --> 2591.1490000000003
[Music]

2597.64 --> 2603.2799999999997
anyway

2599.319 --> 2603.2799999999997
right yes sett you're

2605.079 --> 2608.079
correct

2619.96 --> 2625.52
how many people like Ria follow the

2623.04 --> 2629.88
evidence yeah there's big quotation

2625.52 --> 2629.88
marks there yeah back to the

2635.079 --> 2638.079
globe

2638.4 --> 2644.359
less

2640.839 --> 2647.7599999999998
people than altogether rule the world

2644.359 --> 2647.7599999999998
very very few

2648.96 --> 2654.839
people but if you just like it was just

2652.76 --> 2658.48
like Jose you can just like go along

2654.839 --> 2661.2799999999997
with it if you just don't get the deeper

2658.48 --> 2664.0
implications you can mimic the perfect

2661.28 --> 2667.119
argument but if you don't understand

2664.0 --> 2670.119
that argument to the level you should

2667.119 --> 2672.1600000000003
have the deeper Insight you just throw

2670.119 --> 2673.1600000000003
that perfect argument beside you and say

2672.16 --> 2675.5589999999997
like

2673.16 --> 2677.72
no that's what happened with

2675.559 --> 2679.48
Jose and that's what I think also

2677.72 --> 2684.0789999999997
happens with

2679.48 --> 2686.76
RI she just doesn't get it I mean me and

2684.079 --> 2692.28
the guys from fed we've been concluding

2686.76 --> 2692.28
that for a while she just doesn't get

2694.96 --> 2697.96
it

2707.48 --> 2714.88
right you can make a horse answer a math

2711.24 --> 2717.319
question correctly but you can't make it

2714.88 --> 2717.319
understand

2718.04 --> 2722.7599999999998
math that's actually a really good

2721.04 --> 2724.88
comparison don't know why I put the

2722.76 --> 2726.44
horse in it's because the horse going to

2724.88 --> 2729.04
water

2726.44 --> 2731.839
but instead of water it's math yeah you

2729.04 --> 2731.839
can make a

2731.96 --> 2738.119
horse give the right answer to a math

2735.0 --> 2740.92
question but you can't make the horse

2738.119 --> 2740.92
understand the math

2744.51 --> 2747.579
[Music]

2754.88 --> 2757.88
question

2769.24 --> 2773.24
Ballers that aren't even

2779.52 --> 2787.8
Ballers no

2782.559 --> 2787.8
but that that doesn't oh hiccup

2795.599 --> 2800.6400000000003
damn no there's no such thing you

2798.68 --> 2803.319
misinterpreted that I think Ballers that

2800.64 --> 2805.0
aren't even Ballers no they

2803.319 --> 2807.319
are

2805.0 --> 2811.079
but there's just so many Ballers that

2807.319 --> 2814.4
like underestimate how complex it

2811.079 --> 2817.2400000000002
is they are ballers because part of a

2814.4 --> 2819.839
baller would have to to be that you

2817.24 --> 2823.64
don't realize how stupid it really

2819.839 --> 2828.16
is that you think it's actually

2823.64 --> 2828.16
smart big part is the suspense of

2832.319 --> 2838.359
disbelief but there are some people that

2836.16 --> 2841.44
that are like dumb shits and trash

2838.359 --> 2844.72
people that will TR that they they want

2841.44 --> 2846.599
to seem smarter than they really

2844.72 --> 2849.0
are

2846.599 --> 2853.6800000000003
they long for that and so they will try

2849.0 --> 2856.319
to be smart with baller school stuff so

2853.68 --> 2858.839
that the people that don't really get it

2856.319 --> 2861.64
either just know like oh that guy

2858.839 --> 2863.96
actually paid attention in school

2861.64 --> 2865.72
right so that they can have like this

2863.96 --> 2867.52
micro moment of having being being

2865.72 --> 2869.9199999999996
looked up against even though they're

2867.52 --> 2872.2
actually dumb

2869.92 --> 2874.64
shits I think that's probably what I was

2872.2 --> 2874.64
talking

2874.72 --> 2880.2
about

2876.76 --> 2880.2000000000003
CU that happens a lot out

2883.4 --> 2886.4
there

2887.04 --> 2895.15
what who banned me no not in here Tommy

2890.52 --> 2898.079
it's in uh on fed

2895.15 --> 2900.44
[Music]

2898.079 --> 2903.6800000000003
right 9080

2900.44 --> 2905.28
Channel and I did actually Skype message

2903.68 --> 2909.96
Nathan about it but he hasn't really

2905.28 --> 2909.96
responded it he hasn't even read it

2912.76 --> 2918.6400000000003
[Music]

2915.599 --> 2922.92
yet it could be Nathan doesn't really

2918.64 --> 2922.92
give a [ __ ] or like duper like I

2923.79 --> 2926.92
[Music]

2934.599 --> 2937.599
do

2949.32 --> 2952.349
[Music]

2959.68 --> 2963.64
no clutch it's not fair to say

2964.52 --> 2967.52
that

2969.319 --> 2973.4
oh you created a new account okay fair

2971.599 --> 2975.799
enough

2973.4 --> 2978.28
duper but I mean I totally get if you

2975.799 --> 2980.48
want to hold on to your old account

2978.28 --> 2981.96
right because there's a certain timing

2980.48 --> 2983.559
on it it's

2981.96 --> 2986.52
identifiable

2983.559 --> 2988.6800000000003
right people that make brand new sock

2986.52 --> 2991.68
accounts are

2988.68 --> 2996.16
distrusted so I get

2991.68 --> 2998.5989999999997
it but delete that message I I guess I

2996.16 --> 3002.64
could just delete

2998.599 --> 3002.6400000000003
it okay fine I'll delete

3009.24 --> 3012.24
it

3024.44 --> 3027.44
done

3035.799 --> 3040.119
the difference with me is that they have

3043.079 --> 3047.4
okay right but you're not doing any

3045.2 --> 3052.359
videos anyway

3047.4 --> 3057.44
duper so it's just social media

3052.359 --> 3059.839
accounts you're not making video

3057.44 --> 3061.839
videos Neil the I read your message

3059.839 --> 3067.2799999999997
about Neil the grass

3061.839 --> 3067.2799999999997
Tyson I did see that

3084.359 --> 3088.119
what

3085.96 --> 3091.76
O'Neal degrass Tyson was belittling

3088.119 --> 3093.839
astrology of course he was they have to

3091.76 --> 3097.3590000000004
do that D

3093.839 --> 3097.359
it they're

3097.559 --> 3105.2400000000002
astrophysicists astrology is

3101.079 --> 3108.76
like the exact that's like they're

3105.24 --> 3111.72
Nemesis they have to ridicule

3108.76 --> 3114.3590000000004
it like everything about astrology

I me like Alex Jones seem to be just

3419.52 --> 3425.0
infatuated with him and like it's kind

3422.96 --> 3426.92
of funny when Alex Jones gets on with

3425.0 --> 3429.559
him like it's

3426.92 --> 3433.48
interesting but not because of [ __ ]

3429.559 --> 3436.079
Joe like he's lame man don't don't you

3433.48 --> 3439.96

3436.079 --> 3445.4
is and that's me saying it okay and I'm

3439.96 --> 3448.68
a nobody out there with a micro Channel

3445.4 --> 3451.48
it's like there's nothing interesting

3448.68 --> 3451.48
about that

3471.76 --> 3476.7990000000004
guy oh

3473.799 --> 3476.799
okay

3484.64 --> 3490.799
I mean what Joe should really do is just

3487.52 --> 3495.119
dig in his own Roots like to get back to

3490.799 --> 3495.119
like where he what he was doing

3496.52 --> 3501.319
before and just stop being a layal

3532.559 --> 3539.6400000000003
know bow Ballers take and DT no know

3536.799 --> 3542.319
you're right that's sensible

3539.64 --> 3546.68
enough yeah sure the people that are

3542.319 --> 3548.5589999999997
really serious about the the ball and

3546.68 --> 3552.0789999999997
math and all that yeah they're probably

3548.559 --> 3554.6800000000003
like oh NDT we don't like him he says a

3552.079 --> 3558.039
lot of stupid things because he does and

3554.68 --> 3560.96
you'd know it but n is like for the

3558.039 --> 3560.96
kiddos out

3563.64 --> 3566.64
there

3573.119 --> 3579.319
I mean isn't that

3575.76 --> 3579.3190000000004
obvious that he's like

3579.68 --> 3585.96
a there to like teach children about

3582.92 --> 3585.96
space and all that

3586.24 --> 3593.5989999999997
nonsense and he's not really for

3590.599 --> 3596.52
adults he doesn't talk like an adult he

3593.599 --> 3597.76
doesn't talk with you it's like it's

3596.52 --> 3600.7599999999998
just

3597.76 --> 3600.76
like

3601.319 --> 3608.24
yeah I mean is it just

3604.839 --> 3611.799
me or is he just he's always like like a

3608.24 --> 3611.799
kid teacher or something he

3613.92 --> 3618.559
doesn't like when they're really young

3616.119 --> 3623.559
teens

3618.559 --> 3626.559
like everything he does is just not very

3623.559 --> 3626.559
adult

3632.64 --> 3639.68
don't think he's for

3635.119 --> 3645.2000000000003
kids but not like little kids like oh

3639.68 --> 3645.2
are so cute but it's like it's not for

3648.96 --> 3654.2400000000002
adults like I don't freaking talk to

3651.839 --> 3659.16
adults like that I don't try to explain

3654.24 --> 3659.16
things like that to adults it's

3670.079 --> 3675.3590000000004
ridiculous not even kids deserve to wife

3673.079 --> 3678.52
I'm not saying that you should it's just

3675.359 --> 3681.0389999999998
that like the way he's doing it it just

3678.52 --> 3686.44
seems like it's actually meant for like

3681.039 --> 3686.44
kids and teens and stuff not for

3713.44 --> 3718.16
adults

3715.319 --> 3720.48
some people overlain stuff yeah I even I

3718.16 --> 3720.48
do

3728.359 --> 3735.839
that sometimes I catch myself like sort

3731.44 --> 3738.16
of like Nathan's like on Nathan Oakley

3735.839 --> 3741.839
show and the guys are making like a

3738.16 --> 3743.799
really complicated like high wizard

3741.839 --> 3745.24
Point like where you really have the

3743.799 --> 3747.319
oversight and then it's like they

3745.24 --> 3750.359
explain things and then I'm there I'm

3747.319 --> 3752.2
like I have to report to the dumb people

3750.359 --> 3755.0789999999997
to explain to them what the [ __ ] going

3752.2 --> 3757.0
on here what we're actually discussing

3755.079 --> 3759.799
so then I like make these points that

3757.0 --> 3762.119
are like kind of obvious but I'm making

3759.799 --> 3765.2
them so that they're outspoken and then

3762.119 --> 3767.6400000000003
everybody's like yeah Arwin we get that

3765.2 --> 3769.9199999999996
can we move and I'm like I'm just trying

3767.64 --> 3773.0
to explain to the people that aren't

3769.92 --> 3773.0
freaking natural

3773.2 --> 3777.16
Geniuses could could you give them a

3802.68 --> 3806.72
break what what's going on

3814.16 --> 3820.1189999999997
tet who do you guys take Serious to Mr

3823.96 --> 3827.44
wble okay

3833.279 --> 3836.279
interesting

3842.799 --> 3847.88
oh yeah it's a good question and they

3844.319 --> 3847.88
all answered apparently

3854.68 --> 3863.0389999999998
so right so it seems like they are

3859.079 --> 3866.1600000000003
also not taking NASA very

3863.039 --> 3869.96
serious at the astrophysicist blabber

3866.16 --> 3874.0
mouths in media not very serious it just

3869.96 --> 3878.599
goes to show that real ball belief real

3874.0 --> 3881.52
Bard is in your heart like a real balard

3878.599 --> 3884.2000000000003
doesn't have a balard priest to keep

3881.52 --> 3886.24
telling them it's a ball the real ball

3884.2 --> 3889.52
believer is like

3886.24 --> 3892.64
independent so even if everything turns

3889.52 --> 3895.2
out to be faked pointing at that it's

3892.64 --> 3897.0389999999998
all faked

3895.2 --> 3899.4399999999996
that doesn't mean that it can't be real

3897.039 --> 3903.76
it just means that it has been faked why

3899.44 --> 3903.76
well because who knows maybe

3905.96 --> 3912.279
because whatever they wanted to hide the

3909.52 --> 3915.16
real thing right like the secret moon

3912.279 --> 3918.92
landing they did the fake

3915.16 --> 3921.799
setup the staged fake moon landing in a

3918.92 --> 3925.0
warehouse but that's only to cover up

3921.799 --> 3928.559
for the real moon landing that happen in

3925.0 --> 3928.559
secret see how that

3945.319 --> 3951.0
works right that's why I'm hash secret

3948.559 --> 3951.0
space

3952.68 --> 3957.8799999999997
program cuz before I got into

3955.92 --> 3959.64
consciously got into Flat Earth got

3957.88 --> 3961.6800000000003
confronted with it plenty of times but

3959.64 --> 3964.44
before I consciously realized like yeah

3961.68 --> 3966.48
it is flat it really really is flat I

3964.44 --> 3968.599
have to now accept

3966.48 --> 3971.119
permanently I can't just have it in the

3968.599 --> 3971.119
back of my

3971.64 --> 3979.319
mind but even before that it's like yeah

3974.68 --> 3979.319
this is creepy this NASA stuff can't be

3980.0 --> 3985.079
real

3982.559 --> 3989.3590000000004
but does that

3985.079 --> 3992.52
mean it that they can't go to the

3989.359 --> 3996.0389999999998
moon or that they rushed it and so they

3992.52 --> 3998.319
like roll out a theatrical production

3996.039 --> 4002.44
while they in the meantime take their

3998.319 --> 4004.0
time to really get to the moon right so

4002.44 --> 4006.76
that's how I then thought it's like oh

4004.0 --> 4009.119
well I guess they showed us a nonsense

4006.76 --> 4010.8390000000004
thing I argued even like oh maybe

4009.119 --> 4013.0
they're trying to discourage the other

4010.839 --> 4015.2
countries from doing

4013.0 --> 4018.119
it

4015.2 --> 4020.52
by showing a faked version so that the

4018.119 --> 4022.48
other countries might think that it's

4020.52 --> 4025.119
not even real not

4022.48 --> 4028.16
possible so that they the Americans

4025.119 --> 4029.7200000000003
could keep it for themselves like cuz

4028.16 --> 4032.799
nobody else was going to try because it

4029.72 --> 4035.68
looked so fake I dude you could take

4032.799 --> 4039.0
that [ __ ] in all directions without ever

4035.68 --> 4041.5589999999997
recognizing the Earth is flat or outer

4039.0 --> 4044.92
space being

4041.559 --> 4048.2000000000003
fake and I did I did take it in all

4044.92 --> 4048.2000000000003
kinds of directions back

4048.799 --> 4054.64
then oh the irony

4051.359 --> 4060.0389999999998
indeed especially now that India is now

4054.64 --> 4062.72
also going to the moon and so it's China

4060.039 --> 4066.279
and all that [ __ ]

4062.72 --> 4066.279
yeah it's kind of

4068.599 --> 4075.039
weird it's like no we can also fake a

4072.839 --> 4077.319
moon landing

4075.039 --> 4079.039
and ironically that's literally what

4077.319 --> 4081.7599999999998
that

4079.039 --> 4083.4
is what it's like what America you think

4081.76 --> 4085.92
you're the only one that can fake a moon

4083.4 --> 4090.2000000000003
landing we can do that

4085.92 --> 4093.6800000000003
too we got the resources like we have

4090.2 --> 4097.96
advanced technologically to the point

4093.68 --> 4102.48
where we too can fake a moon

4097.96 --> 4107.04
landing yeah that's what that

4102.48 --> 4110.3189999999995
is we're our our civilization has become

4107.04 --> 4114.5199999999995

4110.319 --> 4114.52

tension it's like you forge it and now

4282.76 --> 4285.679

4519.4 --> 4525.199
it right it's a spell it's supposed to

4522.679 --> 4525.1990000000005
be real

4527.32 --> 4533.08
like yeah it looks absolutely ridiculous

4529.88 --> 4533.08
but it's supposed to be

4538.4 --> 4545.28
real right and because of that mindset

4542.56 --> 4547.56
like it's supposed to be real it has a

4545.28 --> 4549.84
weird Mandela effect in a way I think

4547.56 --> 4551.679
it's actually the Mandela brain that's

4549.84 --> 4553.360000000001
getting involved with that and that's

4551.679 --> 4556.04
maybe part of the reason why they do it

4553.36 --> 4559.12
it right

4556.04 --> 4560.88
anticipation then it's really [ __ ]

4559.12 --> 4563.159
ugly it's

4560.88 --> 4565.32
disappointing but you don't want to give

4563.159 --> 4569.239
up on the situation you're really

4565.32 --> 4572.44
invested so your aesthetic sense will

4569.239 --> 4575.0
literally just scrap the freaking

4572.44 --> 4578.5199999999995
ugliness and then replace it with what

4575.0 --> 4578.52
you thought it was going to look

4578.84 --> 4585.12
like and then you have a Mandela

4582.12 --> 4585.12
effect

4588.6 --> 4592.92
they might be using

4590.36 --> 4595.839999999999
it they might even be doing some

4592.92 --> 4599.28
graphics really ugly and like you can

4595.84 --> 4602.679
see it's fake right away specifically to

4599.28 --> 4603.599999999999
trigger the aesthetic sense to replace

4602.679 --> 4608.159
the

4603.6 --> 4610.08
memory it might be like part of their

4608.159 --> 4612.839999999999
technique what they

4610.08 --> 4614.12
do that I've never even realized that

4612.84 --> 4617.12
before about

4614.12 --> 4619.0
it right there might be a purpose to why

4617.12 --> 4622.08
they do it so

4619.0 --> 4624.84
ugly Beyond just dupers Delight are like

4622.08 --> 4627.76
haa look at we don't

4624.84 --> 4631.84
care they might actually be attempting

4627.76 --> 4634.56
to like social engineer by doing

4631.84 --> 4639.2390000000005
that perhaps actively triggering the

4634.56 --> 4639.2390000000005
aesthetic sense to induce a Mandela like

4642.0 --> 4645.8
effect it's just an

4646.88 --> 4652.52
idea right maybe worth simulating in the

4649.92 --> 4655.36
mind to see like hey is that could there

4652.52 --> 4655.360000000001
be something to

4672.0 --> 4675.0
that

4683.4 --> 4690.239
NDT begs for more space

4685.84 --> 4692.92
funds okay well I just beg for food

4690.239 --> 4695.159
funds as in could you guys please

4692.92 --> 4697.719
support me I hope you really like my

4695.159 --> 4697.719

Jesus dude I'd be happy with 30,000 a

4730.76 --> 4734.92
year I'd be really freaking happy

4737.92 --> 4742.12
150 million a year

4742.76 --> 4747.360000000001
insane it's like what the [ __ ] you think

4744.96 --> 4747.36
you are

4760.52 --> 4764.84
nobility right

4765.75 --> 4769.199
[Music]

4779.76 --> 4786.679
space does

4781.88 --> 4791.84
exist it's before every comma oh

4786.679 --> 4794.84
funny very funny oh

4791.84 --> 4794.84
more

4803.32 --> 4809.0
space does exist it's the biggest key on

4806.76 --> 4809.0
the

4821.76 --> 4824.76
keyboard

4843.239 --> 4847.5599999999995
right anyway I hope you guys are

4844.88 --> 4849.32
enjoying the show and probably going to

4847.56 --> 4851.719
round out pretty

4849.32 --> 4854.719
soon got a title

4851.719 --> 4854.719
already

4855.92 --> 4859.36
really looking forward to my

4869.27 --> 4875.21
[Music]

4876.48 --> 4880.4
coffee I love the grammar police said no

4879.199 --> 4883.678999999999
one

4880.4 --> 4887.679
ever I appreciate a grammar

4883.679 --> 4891.719
police I mean it's like annoying but I

4887.679 --> 4895.4400000000005
mean I love having good grammar somebody

4891.719 --> 4899.04
corrects me it's like ah damn it but

4895.44 --> 4902.08
like I'm happy to be corrected it's

4899.04 --> 4904.36
just if it's just a gamma that's just

4902.08 --> 4907.32
like refusing to listen to what I'm

4904.36 --> 4910.839999999999
talking about and only whs about the

4907.32 --> 4913.5599999999995
grammar and not about the subject that's

4910.84 --> 4916.88
[ __ ] annoying

4913.56 --> 4920.88
but in general I don't

4916.88 --> 4924.0
mind I like it I I like people that want

4920.88 --> 4927.719
to get the details right with

4924.0 --> 4930.92
language language is culture language is

4927.719 --> 4933.4
strength old British understood this

4930.92 --> 4933.4
like none

4933.84 --> 4940.159000000001
other and the the castilians too the

4937.28 --> 4943.719
Spanish old Spanish they got that too

4940.159 --> 4946.04
they knew it that the language was power

4943.719 --> 4946.04
very

4951.8 --> 4957.18
serious right so correcting each other

4954.44 --> 4960.7699999999995
legitimately is a good good

4957.18 --> 4960.77
[Music]

4961.639 --> 4964.639
thing

4969.719 --> 4974.96
what 62 Millions a day yeah it's right

4972.639 --> 4977.36
ridiculous but I mean it's not like what

4974.96 --> 4979.76
is it doing you know what are they doing

4977.36 --> 4979.759999999999
with that

4980.6 --> 4984.4800000000005
money because it's going

4991.08 --> 4998.36
somewhere yes ter yes I know I've orino

4995.12 --> 5000.28
Wall's been around for years I know what

4998.36 --> 5002.91
he

5000.28 --> 5006.13
does I'm okay with it

5002.91 --> 5006.13
[Music]

5007.76 --> 5011.76
my English is superior the most oh why

5010.199 --> 5013.879999999999
thank you it's not even my first

5011.76 --> 5016.8
language so I really appreciate hearing

5013.88 --> 5019.639
that I take English very

5016.8 --> 5022.360000000001
serious I also take my own language very

5019.639 --> 5027.639
serious but I don't get to use it as

5022.36 --> 5027.639
much cuz I don't do my show in

5029.639 --> 5035.92
Dutch but there's definitely power in

5032.239 --> 5035.919999999999
the Dutch language I know it

5041.08 --> 5044.08
is

5044.92 --> 5052.0
right like I really know it about

5047.32 --> 5052.0
English about Dutch about

5054.56 --> 5061.360000000001
Spanish those are like they have like a

5058.44 --> 5063.879999999999
certain type of magic to

5061.36 --> 5066.32
it

5063.88 --> 5071.2390000000005
other languages have

5066.32 --> 5073.719
strengths and dynamic natures and like

5071.239 --> 5073.718999999999
what it's

5077.96 --> 5084.56
different it doesn't have like a similar

5082.239 --> 5087.32
type of power to it like German language

5084.56 --> 5090.56
is is interesting it's amazing and like

5087.32 --> 5095.159
can be made very

5090.56 --> 5097.360000000001
beautiful but it's different and I think

5095.159 --> 5098.96
so is Russian I don't know too much

5097.36 --> 5101.159
about Russian but from what I've seen

5098.96 --> 5103.28
it's like

5101.159 --> 5106.679
it's

5103.28 --> 5106.679
different it's

5107.239 --> 5112.959999999999
just it's just so freaking

5110.6 --> 5115.0
different that's about as far as I can

5112.96 --> 5117.92
go with that so

5115.0 --> 5120.199
anyway but I have personally sampled

5117.92 --> 5123.4
like yeah my own language it can be

5120.199 --> 5127.48
really magical Spanish can be really

5123.4 --> 5131.638999999999
magical English can be really

5127.48 --> 5133.5599999999995
magical but it is like the original like

5131.639 --> 5136.28
from the people that take it really

5133.56 --> 5140.159000000001
serious in the past it's really

5136.28 --> 5140.159
like very sharp on

5141.96 --> 5146.36
that and and with Spanish as well

5146.6 --> 5154.92
classical Russian and Spanish share many

5149.719 --> 5158.159
words could be Wrath the the thing is I

5154.92 --> 5158.159
really don't understand

5162.4 --> 5169.879999999999
Russian like I don't get it it's very

5166.4 --> 5172.119
hard to read Russians too cuz they

5169.88 --> 5175.8
compose themselves so

5172.119 --> 5178.04
differently well I don't I haven't

5175.8 --> 5181.159000000001
really mastered the Spanish language but

5178.04 --> 5183.719
if a a real Spaniard is trying to tell

5181.159 --> 5185.08
me something in Spanish I will be able

5183.719 --> 5187.92
to figure it

5185.08 --> 5190.96
out that's the

5187.92 --> 5194.36
difference because also Spanish tend to

5190.96 --> 5194.36
like communicate more

5194.48 --> 5197.839999999999
vividly and that

5198.08 --> 5202.84
helps and with the English it's just

5201.04 --> 5206.719
that the people that have the actual

5202.84 --> 5209.679
talent for the English it's just that

5206.719 --> 5213.28
yeah it's just a language but it's big

5209.679 --> 5215.52
it it's like you can do so much with it

5213.28 --> 5219.28
get in detail you don't have to be Vivid

5215.52 --> 5222.2390000000005
or anything it's just you can lay down

5219.28 --> 5224.719
things the same thing so differently

5222.239 --> 5225.638999999999
with the same language it's amazing what

5224.719 --> 5228.199
you can

5225.639 --> 5230.04
do and by the way you have that same

5228.199 --> 5233.5599999999995
power in Dutch you can do that with

5230.04 --> 5236.44
Dutch too but with English I think

5233.56 --> 5238.8
better even

5236.44 --> 5241.28
right anyway I'm going to round out the

5238.8 --> 5245.0
show it's been great I I've liked the

5241.28 --> 5246.599999999999
show I hope you too like this show if
