4.24 --> 28.979999999999997
[Music]

31.63 --> 33.689
you

42.21 --> 44.3

58.89 --> 62.730000000000004
i'm going live which is normally 2 p.m.

61.05 --> 65.16
amsterdam time every day

62.73 --> 68.85
please also do support me through the

65.16 --> 70.44
paper the paypal patreon my GoFundMe and

68.85 --> 71.33999999999999
the super chat that would be much

70.44 --> 78.149
appreciated

71.34 --> 83.49000000000001
so today the weather is quite beautiful

78.149 --> 87.83
although yeah these clouds I can

83.49 --> 91.77
definitely say are chemtrails created as

87.83 --> 93.99
earlier today I actually saw them being

91.77 --> 98.94
sprayed and you can still see that it is

93.99 --> 102.83999999999999
like a giant stripe practically but it

98.94 --> 108.979
is kind of odd even what type of cloud

102.84 --> 113.429
it is for me now it's not like the

108.979 --> 116.64
typical wavy wind feather then let it

113.429 --> 118.5
typically see from chemtrails but yeah

116.64 --> 122.149
anyway despite all that there's still

118.5 --> 122.149
some blue patches although

125.469 --> 131.129
I don't know if you can make this up

127.149 --> 135.129
with the webcam but there's like

131.129 --> 138.16
literals looking sand dune ripples over

135.129 --> 139.959
there in the clouds in a specific spot

138.16 --> 144.31
that I'm pointing it's so weird to see

139.959 --> 147.209
that anyway

144.31 --> 151.15
yeah and they're still going at it

147.209 --> 157.09
seeing one get going

151.15 --> 161.579
spraying right there in between the tree

157.09 --> 171.519
and the cloud there if you can see it

161.579 --> 174.06900000000002
anyway it dad despite all that it is not

171.519 --> 177.43
windy which is very pleasant and the Sun

174.069 --> 180.19
is just beautiful didn't wait didn't

177.43 --> 182.28
even point down you know just look at

180.19 --> 186.97
that it's gorgeous

182.28 --> 189.97
so yeah despite all that it's still

186.97 --> 192.16
pretty beautiful but you have to keep

189.97 --> 196.23
this up then eventually in the evening

192.16 --> 196.23
it's probably gonna be full-out clouded

202.03 --> 215.12
[Music]

209.21 --> 218.0
Peabody PayPal yeah let's see who's in

215.12 --> 220.76
chat hmm right

218.0 --> 224.69
Gideon SiC was first good servant and

220.76 --> 231.95
then the young calling dresser yeah it's

224.69 --> 234.19
time you got a rich Tom Parker over mu

231.95 --> 234.19
cool

235.69 --> 247.65
bate 60 RMC good servant

243.1 --> 251.79999999999998
no English B yeah good to see you all so

247.65 --> 256.75
again today I have with me yeah green

251.8 --> 258.55
tea it's been very enjoyable last few

256.75 --> 261.459
days just enjoying the tea a lot I don't

258.55 --> 266.28000000000003
know why but just taste back and I still

261.459 --> 270.63
have some strawberry from yesterday

266.28 --> 273.78999999999996
it's basically my breakfast sort of and

270.63 --> 277.39
for some nice blueberries that I barely

273.79 --> 281.68
even touched and I also noticed that

277.39 --> 285.21999999999997
this package here is kind of cool

281.68 --> 287.83
well-designed because I don't know I

285.22 --> 290.08000000000004
just put this like right under the tap

287.83 --> 292.27
water and you could wash it out and

290.08 --> 295.47999999999996
because of the holes in the bottom yeah

292.27 --> 297.52
it's it doubles as a sieve to clean it

295.48 --> 299.20000000000005
quickly it's like I never even realized

297.52 --> 299.65
that about the design but it was pretty

299.2 --> 301.84
awesome

299.65 --> 304.10999999999996
anyway I'm going to enjoy some of that

301.84 --> 307.89
combined with the Sun that's gonna be

304.11 --> 307.89
good experience I think

310.85 --> 313.85
huh

314.58 --> 317.21
okay

317.5 --> 323.83
that's also a plane flying over yeah

320.95 --> 326.05
it's out of you now but it was not

323.83 --> 331.71999999999997
leaving at Camp Joe it was just leaving

326.05 --> 334.51
a contrail that dissipated that's was

331.72 --> 346.14000000000004
that the same plane that left that trail

334.51 --> 346.14
over there huh it's getting weird

349.38 --> 356.98
no 101 Rockland I have not researched

352.71 --> 360.18
event whatever accident yeah order 66 or

356.98 --> 363.79
whatever blah you know at this point

360.18 --> 368.74
like there's gonna be so much conspiracy

363.79 --> 371.16
nonsense fabricated to distract from

368.74 --> 373.90000000000003
just base things going on I think that

371.16 --> 376.48
it's becoming less and less interesting

373.9 --> 379.84
to just see what pops up now conspiracy

376.48 --> 383.8
wise because people are going out of

379.84 --> 386.38
control in my opinion but that's natural

383.8 --> 388.78000000000003
side effect of just what's going on in

386.38 --> 395.37
the world and the singularity of the

388.78 --> 395.36999999999995
internet singularity of consciousness

397.77 --> 402.9
email you some Amanda young

407.97 --> 417.85
like this you could take a picture

413.59 --> 419.94
snapshot Oh something I guess wait

417.85 --> 428.98
that's a good angle

419.94 --> 431.13
okay I get this all in view webcams all

428.98 --> 431.13
right

434.759 --> 438.759
yay

436.78 --> 441.55899999999997
[Music]

438.759 --> 444.619
it's really annoying using that webcam

441.559 --> 447.199
to do that because it's like yeah I need

444.619 --> 450.939
to turn it that way oh wait that means I

447.199 --> 450.939
have to move the other way and then ah

453.009 --> 463.24
anyway

454.339 --> 471.019
oh sure one on one rock Cohn sure it is

463.24 --> 473.779
huh blueberry pancakes I've never

471.019 --> 476.409
actually had one of those although I do

473.779 --> 478.55
remember just getting pancakes and then

476.409 --> 482.929
putting like things like whipped cream

478.55 --> 485.629
and blueberries on them or blueberries

482.929 --> 488.029
and other berries but I don't know if

485.629 --> 495.249
that is that or just but yeah what you

488.029 --> 498.379
meant can be nice I guess I don't know

495.249 --> 503.71900000000005
it's this thing about pancakes you know

498.379 --> 505.43
eating pancakes alone sucks pancakes is

503.719 --> 508.61
only really fun when you have somebody

505.43 --> 511.089
to share it with I think maybe that's

508.61 --> 511.089
just me

518.259 --> 522.169
yeah

519.44 --> 523.94
101 rockhound you tell me what it is I'm

522.169 --> 528.079
not gonna search anything I'm not gonna

523.94 --> 530.839
feed Google what it wants I'm gonna bait

528.079 --> 536.709
you just tell me you bait so you tell me

530.839 --> 536.7090000000001
what it is and now think about it

540.4 --> 543.5699999999999
[Music]

557.99 --> 564.54
well I do my best mark color in general

561.96 --> 566.97
I try to eat healthy and when I kind of

564.54 --> 569.2199999999999
decide to eat something on the show I'm

566.97 --> 571.38
that better well I'm gonna make sure

569.22 --> 582.75
it's healthy as well to set a healthy

571.38 --> 584.88
example and also one of the reasons why

582.75 --> 586.2
I basically refused to ever smoke on

584.88 --> 592.5
camera I'm not gonna do that

586.2 --> 596.1600000000001
even if I could or at least not on the

592.5 --> 601.8
show or something you know a beer maybe

596.16 --> 603.12
if it's like a special occasion but yeah

601.8 --> 604.5
I'm not gonna do that of course on the

603.12 --> 607.7
earlybird show it's way too early for

604.5 --> 607.7
that so

611.18 --> 618.1089999999999
[Music]

620.66 --> 632.76
coloured and exercise I care and be by

623.85 --> 636.45
the way and John em yeah John em you

632.76 --> 640.31
know by correlation one could argue that

636.45 --> 644.4200000000001
the virus seems to spread based on

640.31 --> 644.42
attention and popularity

651.94 --> 655.259
[Music]

659.95 --> 664.089
okay 201 is an exercise Oh and exercise

663.399 --> 671.56
Wow

664.089 --> 674.889
never seen that before what was the name

671.56 --> 681.16
again remember that that previous

674.889 --> 685.5600000000001
exercise one was it was it right before

681.16 --> 690.16
Trump got elected I think when was it

685.56 --> 692.3199999999999
thousand fourteen or something sorry if

690.16 --> 694.99
a guy wrong but there was this exercise

692.32 --> 700.24
in America and Alex Jones I like the

694.99 --> 703.839
[ __ ] out of that and yeah not a lot came

700.24 --> 705.73
from it but like it could have and

703.839 --> 709.1800000000001
eventually that was the conclusion it's

705.73 --> 711.76
like a test and yeah with all the issues

709.18 --> 715.93
in place [ __ ] like could get really bad

711.76 --> 716.709
but they just didn't really do that what

715.93 --> 720.6099999999999
was the name again

716.709 --> 723.1199999999999
of it it was not paid at pandemic

720.61 --> 723.12
related

723.32 --> 726.44
[Music]

728.0 --> 736.19
I can be wrong by the way about the date

730.7 --> 744.5600000000001
could be 2010 I don't know man name

736.19 --> 746.1800000000001
again because back then they were also

744.56 --> 751.03
like talking about checkpoints you know

746.18 --> 751.03
it was just not medical related

763.3 --> 767.1899999999999
nobody nobody remembers

777.76 --> 783.79
all right Karen be okay so what what

781.69 --> 789.9590000000001
basically is suggested that it was a

783.79 --> 793.0889999999999
scenario it was a scenario just like

789.959 --> 795.43
9/11 literally was a scenario that was

793.089 --> 798.4590000000001
on paper Alex Jones like held it up on

795.43 --> 801.6389999999999
camera many times and all that before

798.459 --> 805.8389999999999
9/11 had have 9/11 happened now it did

801.639 --> 808.089
it gave it as a hypothetical example and

805.839 --> 809.7090000000001
like the freaking towers were like on

808.089 --> 814.75
the front of the paper with a plane

809.709 --> 818.7689999999999
flying towards them okay so that thing

814.75 --> 821.26
was a scenario it was technically

818.769 --> 824.829
hypothetical and it seemed very much

821.26 --> 826.75
like they engaged at it so are you guys

824.829 --> 828.7299999999999
saying that this is the sentence like

826.75 --> 832.06
somebody figured out some plan from

828.73 --> 835.899
while ago and yet it seems like that's

832.06 --> 838.3
exactly the corona response situation

835.899 --> 839.8
and the media hype and all that is that

838.3 --> 843.3389999999999
what somebody found I wouldn't be

839.8 --> 847.3
surprised because yeah many of these

843.339 --> 850.149
things you know the timing I don't know

847.3 --> 854.1099999999999
about the timing but there's plans for

850.149 --> 856.389
every type of scenario and you'd be

854.11 --> 859.29
surprised how synchronized groups are

856.389 --> 859.29
with those friends

863.11 --> 875.4
oh dear God

877.95 --> 885.97
okay so everybody's now panicked up it's

881.02 --> 888.6999999999999
like okay right - coronavirus probably

885.97 --> 892.45
not as bad as is being suggested but

888.7 --> 899.6500000000001
you're still gonna panic because there

892.45 --> 901.8100000000001
was a script somewhere and it suggests

899.65 --> 904.93
pretty dark things at the end of it

901.81 --> 907.9599999999999
right so what are you doing now you're

904.93 --> 910.87
panicking and is that the starting

907.96 --> 913.7800000000001
signal like wow okay well we we figured

910.87 --> 917.32
out that viruses probably are not really

913.78 --> 919.42
what they say they are but well if the

917.32 --> 922.2700000000001
government does some kind of move once

919.42 --> 928.78
more control again as they always do on

922.27 --> 931.42
like a regular basis like as far as we

928.78 --> 933.01
know forever they've always done that

931.42 --> 933.8499999999999
kind of thing so now it's time to panic

933.01 --> 940.06
again No

933.85 --> 942.13
okay good all right well if you're gonna

940.06 --> 948.43
take that [ __ ] into account then make

942.13 --> 952.42
sure that you don't ya realize it still

948.43 --> 955.18
all have to be executed by people and

952.42 --> 958.18
all these people may have mixed interest

955.18 --> 963.16
but also mixed feelings concerning it oh

958.18 --> 966.0999999999999
and just look at where all the where

963.16 --> 968.1999999999999
yeah where the moral weak points you

966.1 --> 972.0
know because a lot of these plans are

968.2 --> 972.0
kind of idealized really

973.699 --> 982.2489999999999
they're still scenarios so idea anyway I

979.959 --> 984.41
met a talking now because I don't

982.249 --> 994.2090000000001
exactly know what it contains this of a

984.41 --> 994.209
scenario to anyone Oh God

1011.47 --> 1016.21
Yeah right yeah I know George Sanford

1013.96 --> 1021.39
yeah shutting down stuff it's it's

1016.21 --> 1021.39
everywhere not just the United States

1022.36 --> 1027.069
yeah even yesterday it was kind of weird

1024.4 --> 1030.3390000000002
I said on the show like yeah the coffee

1027.069 --> 1032.17
shop is down I don't know why but I'll

1030.339 --> 1033.97
check out the others well I did check

1032.17 --> 1035.5890000000002
out the others and they were all closed

1033.97 --> 1037.03
every single one of them then I looked

1035.589 --> 1039.73
up on the internet apparently weren't

1037.03 --> 1043.949
there was this mandate that made them

1039.73 --> 1049.63
all closed up until April 7th like what

1043.949 --> 1052.69
three weeks seriously just closed but

1049.63 --> 1056.95
yeah anyway that didn't mean however

1052.69 --> 1061.45
that I could not find another way to get

1056.95 --> 1067.39
it and yeah so I went on a little kind

1061.45 --> 1074.89
of side adventure in public and I still

1067.39 --> 1079.15
got some very happy about it so yeah the

1074.89 --> 1080.98
even as is said in like local newspapers

1079.15 --> 1082.75
and everything street dealers are

1080.98 --> 1085.3600000000001
killing it they're making a killing off

1082.75 --> 1087.46
this and yeah coffee shop owners are

1085.36 --> 1089.2299999999998
probably not gonna be very happy because

1087.46 --> 1093.1000000000001
they're gonna make a loss so it seems

1089.23 --> 1096.67
like why why is this this really

1093.1 --> 1100.06
necessary couldn't it be handled in

1096.67 --> 1102.5800000000002
another way like okay if you have to

1100.06 --> 1103.87
minimize contact at the distribution

1102.58 --> 1105.85
point which is what coffee shops

1103.87 --> 1107.83
basically all right well close down of

1105.85 --> 1111.49
course the seating areas because there's

1107.83 --> 1116.46
yeah it's gonna spread presuming virus

1111.49 --> 1122.89
danger right why don't they just do it

1116.46 --> 1125.98
closer to a like a bank setup where you

1122.89 --> 1129.19
just have a plastic wall in between and

1125.98 --> 1134.02
a in exchange compartment so it's just

1129.19 --> 1136.18
like okay say okay it's cash card only

1134.02 --> 1139.59
no no cash because cash will also be

1136.18 --> 1142.39
here and then it's just okay pay loop

1139.59 --> 1143.6799999999998
insert thing there's no real risk that

1142.39 --> 1148.39
way

1143.68 --> 1149.8600000000001
I don't know I'm being maybe I'm being

1148.39 --> 1153.2800000000002
very practical about it it's just like

1149.86 --> 1156.61
if if something like that could be done

1153.28 --> 1158.559
as a change of setup for these stores

1156.61 --> 1161.02
then yeah people are not going to be

1158.559 --> 1164.83
without their cannabis in getting our

1161.02 --> 1168.34
restless and [ __ ] you know just trying

1164.83 --> 1170.6799999999998
to be pragmatic here on the other hand

1168.34 --> 1174.9289999999999
yeah there's a set street dealers are

1170.68 --> 1177.16
making a killing so I don't really know

1174.929 --> 1180.01
what's gonna happen with all that but I

1177.16 --> 1185.6100000000001
found it very odd that it would just be

1180.01 --> 1185.61
decided like that doesn't feel right

1195.63 --> 1201.5100000000002
but I think that my idea in general is

1199.14 --> 1203.3400000000001
like okay if it is supposedly all about

1201.51 --> 1205.049
the contact and about sitting in the

1203.34 --> 1209.6689999999999
same room for anything the same area if

1205.049 --> 1211.9189999999999
that is a problem then just get a

1209.669 --> 1215.429
plastic wall in between and make it more

1211.919 --> 1224.8500000000001
of an exchange setup so as to minimize

1215.429 --> 1226.47
contact that could yes it could save

1224.85 --> 1230.76
food takeouts

1226.47 --> 1232.409
it could save shops all right it's not

1230.76 --> 1236.669
gonna work at supermarkets that would be

1232.409 --> 1238.71
crazy but yeah I don't know supermarkets

1236.669 --> 1243.63
could potentially it you know if there

1238.71 --> 1246.299
is sufficient air filtration then that

1243.63 --> 1250.44
also minimizes the risk

1246.299 --> 1253.59
it's like properly the air yeah doesn't

1250.44 --> 1255.9
will not have a chance to go stale or go

1253.59 --> 1258.84
to the wrong temperature as it were then

1255.9 --> 1260.7
you also minimize the risk so I that

1258.84 --> 1262.9499999999998
better then we'll keep the supermarkets

1260.7 --> 1266.5800000000002
open that would be absolutely insane

1262.95 --> 1269.159
they closed that and yeah they're not

1266.58 --> 1271.01
gonna do that that would know you would

1269.159 --> 1274.38
have a revolution that would be crazy

1271.01 --> 1276.809
but HEPA filters anyway these are just

1274.38 --> 1279.96
some basic ideas so you can keep things

1276.809 --> 1281.94
going with just small investment and

1279.96 --> 1283.799
there will be no business owners with

1281.94 --> 1285.39
losses be it basically like what the

1283.799 --> 1291.33
hell government why did you do that to

1285.39 --> 1293.789
me you know it's not gonna make anybody

1291.33 --> 1295.789
can come here women anymore popular like

1293.789 --> 1300.049
it could get any worse right well it can

1295.789 --> 1300.049
so anyway

1306.27 --> 1314.16

1308.55 --> 1319.09
what Karen be down don't do that

1314.16 --> 1321.0700000000002
yeah the guy is a creep don't don't call

1319.09 --> 1328.12
for that kind of stuff in my jet please

1321.07 --> 1333.82
I understand the sentiment I have many

1328.12 --> 1337.53
of these types of thoughts at times but

1333.82 --> 1337.53
it's not something I'm willing to like

1337.74 --> 1345.15
yeah willing to approve isn't just not

1343.84 --> 1348.329
not the way to go

1345.15 --> 1348.3290000000002
[Music]

1358.23 --> 1364.96
non-human contact is mental health said

1360.73 --> 1373.18
all right well you know what the people

1364.96 --> 1376.06
will figure it out and I don't know it's

1373.18 --> 1377.3500000000001
like even technically for example if the

1376.06 --> 1379.45
internet would be shut now that's

1377.35 --> 1382.36
another disaster scenario that's not

1379.45 --> 1383.1100000000001
gonna do anyone any good so probably not

1382.36 --> 1386.4399999999998
gonna do that

1383.11 --> 1390.1899999999998
and then yeah if you create some human

1386.44 --> 1392.29
contact you would still be able to like

1390.19 --> 1394.03
go outside on the balcony or something

1392.29 --> 1396.34
and at least talk to people over a

1394.03 --> 1397.8999999999999
distance and I don't know probably a lot

1396.34 --> 1399.58
of people will get their net and get to

1397.9 --> 1404.1100000000001
know their neighbors a lot better all of

1399.58 --> 1406.36
a sudden so it's all mixed it's it's to

1404.11 --> 1416.11
me it just really really feels like a

1406.36 --> 1418.4799999999998
test not just a a test by the government

1416.11 --> 1421.2299999999998
it's also just a test of character in

1418.48 --> 1421.23
general

1433.14 --> 1439.26
okay Jeff from bill hmm yeah I had a bit

1437.64 --> 1441.89
of the sniffles yesterday but seemed

1439.26 --> 1441.89
have gone away

1481.89 --> 1484.67
hmm

1484.92 --> 1490.8500000000001
all right yeah no problem Tom Parker

1487.2 --> 1490.8500000000001
glad you're doing better

1492.71 --> 1495.749
[Music]

1498.24 --> 1504.01
[Music]

1506.07 --> 1513.27
yeah the most important thing is is that

1508.65 --> 1516.0900000000001
first off there's no junk in there as it

1513.27 --> 1518.48
is going to move towards the healing

1516.09 --> 1522.36
face so indeed ya wash it out a little

1518.48 --> 1524.64
until it just feels content enough and

1522.36 --> 1527.3999999999999
then just let it rest as much as

1524.64 --> 1530.64
possible because once it goes to the

1527.4 --> 1532.2900000000002
resting phase ya then you're already

1530.64 --> 1536.72
done unless there still is just

1532.29 --> 1536.72
something that should not be there

1537.49 --> 1541.109
[Music]

1542.99 --> 1554.27
but I'm glad yeah that it's starting to

1545.6 --> 1558.8899999999999
heal up and all that right and moving

1554.27 --> 1561.32
around hope yeah it seems to work for me

1558.89 --> 1563.48
and used to work for my mother a little

1561.32 --> 1565.75
I remember that she did that too at

1563.48 --> 1565.75
times

1571.8 --> 1578.09
and I don't know in certain ways it's

1575.61 --> 1582.12
all about the vibration so for example

1578.09 --> 1583.25
taking a shower a warm shower it's good

1582.12 --> 1588.6299999999999
anyway

1583.25 --> 1592.44
but like the if you have like if you set

1588.63 --> 1594.0300000000002
the shower stream to special type of

1592.44 --> 1595.8600000000001
pole I don't know there's this special

1594.03 --> 1598.32
showerheads now and you can take like

1595.86 --> 1600.6
where it's a more massaging stream as

1598.32 --> 1605.58
it's called that can be very therapeutic

1600.6 --> 1608.79
Oh as well like the date where I like

1605.58 --> 1611.9399999999998
the agonizing night from last week

1608.79 --> 1616.35
remember I had that to first I walked

1611.94 --> 1618.81
around and then if yeah then eventually

1616.35 --> 1620.8799999999999
I ended up just going under the shower

1618.81 --> 1624.06
and doing that pretty much just letting

1620.88 --> 1629.1200000000001
it massage mean and did justice constant

1624.06 --> 1629.12
water vibration was very helpfully well

1631.34 --> 1646.79
so yeah that can help but anyway whoa

1642.8 --> 1653.76
very hot shower will kill viruses oof

1646.79 --> 1657.26
yeah I don't know I I don't really like

1653.76 --> 1657.26
super hot showers that hurts

1658.51 --> 1665.46
[Music]

1660.51 --> 1667.41
I do remember though that in piggy yeah

1665.46 --> 1669.27
when I was sick especially younger yeah

1667.41 --> 1675.74
we used to have a bath I don't anymore

1669.27 --> 1677.94
it's like it me but a bath and just like

1675.74 --> 1681.419
getting to that state where you fall

1677.94 --> 1686.3600000000001
asleep and all that that could be great

1681.419 --> 1690.179
it's like almost you help the fever like

1686.36 --> 1692.82
artificially in a way and that was

1690.179 --> 1696.3200000000002
always good like after I took hot baths

1692.82 --> 1699.48
when I was sick flu or just the sniffles

1696.32 --> 1701.309
it would usually just go better right

1699.48 --> 1703.35
after that as well but I don't have the

1701.309 --> 1712.6789999999999
luxury of having a bathtub unfortunately

1703.35 --> 1717.8999999999999
now yep but most of you don't have that

1712.679 --> 1720.6000000000001
problem yeah and if you take a bath you

1717.9 --> 1722.6100000000001
know what especially of that time when

1720.6 --> 1728.6899999999998
it's supposed to be very therapeutic oh

1722.61 --> 1728.6899999999998
if you I put salt in it it goes yeah

1732.13 --> 1736.94
like you don't have to pour a little

1734.39 --> 1739.01
full with salt up until the post that

1736.94 --> 1744.799
point that you tasted but just some salt

1739.01 --> 1747.019
in it and yeah I don't know i prefer the

1744.799 --> 1750.23
bath salts you know there's bath salts

1747.019 --> 1754.36
but I don't know no I don't always trust

1750.23 --> 1757.22
that so I'd rather actually just take

1754.36 --> 1759.649
salt that was even meant for consumption

1757.22 --> 1761.63
but yeah that you could consider that it

1759.649 --> 1763.9699999999998
may be a bit expensive or a waste but

1761.63 --> 1765.919
then again even when I had a bathtub I

1763.97 --> 1769.46
didn't necessarily take baths a lot I'd

1765.919 --> 1772.97
rather shower and then reserve the baths

1769.46 --> 1773.99
for a special situation scenarios like

1772.97 --> 1777.76
yeah

1773.99 --> 1777.76
recovering from sickness

1780.29 --> 1787.759
[Music]

1791.64 --> 1799.1000000000001
epson salt okay eyelids

1802.1 --> 1812.1699999999998
okay interesting now I'm wondering like

1809.87 --> 1818.4499999999998
what would happen even if you used

1812.17 --> 1820.88
baking soda I don't know it's dead yeah

1818.45 --> 1823.88
don't just blindly try that you know

1820.88 --> 1825.74
maybe look into it first but I wonder

1823.88 --> 1830.3600000000001
that you know baking soda is always such

1825.74 --> 1833.51
a weird amazing substance I wonder if it

1830.36 --> 1837.4099999999999
if it would like clean your your skin

1833.51 --> 1843.61
out really good or something raise the

1837.41 --> 1848.41
pH would it Maki the alkaline mmm-hmm

1843.61 --> 1854.1499999999999
alright anyway it's just just like

1848.41 --> 1857.93
spitballing ideas out there good for a

1854.15 --> 1859.46
foot soak I bet right anyway it just

1857.93 --> 1863.72
popped on there it's like hey what about

1859.46 --> 1865.19
baking soda no it's almost salt it's

1863.72 --> 1867.71
just weird

1865.19 --> 1870.1100000000001
this is just more unique things that

1867.71 --> 1874.99
that is we have it's it's pretty cheap

1870.11 --> 1877.61
as a resource huh I wasn't talking about

1874.99 --> 1883.78
general soda soda is something else

1877.61 --> 1886.6699999999998
that's like the soapy type of stuff so

1883.78 --> 1894.77
that can be good for disinfecting wounds

1886.67 --> 1899.39
as well it's yeah but I meant baking so

1894.77 --> 1901.84
that specifically like what would that

1899.39 --> 1901.8400000000001
do

1905.56 --> 1914.34
because hey if baking soda is going to

1907.75 --> 1917.02
be good for for like yeah for even like

1914.34 --> 1919.78
flushing your mouth and all that you

1917.02 --> 1922.87
know what it do then also similar good

1919.78 --> 1941.86
to just your regular skin I'm just

1922.87 --> 1943.9299999999998
wondering you know anyway I always like

1941.86 --> 1947.35
to experiment with just with these

1943.93 --> 1949.3600000000001
substances it almost kind of makes me

1947.35 --> 1952.48
feel like an alchemist but I do it

1949.36 --> 1955.09
purely for health reasons it's just like

1952.48 --> 1957.16
all these unique things and then what

1955.09 --> 1960.6599999999999
can you do with that and you'd be

1957.16 --> 1964.27
surprised what you yeah what you can

1960.66 --> 1968.3200000000002
just with a handful of specific

1964.27 --> 1970.36
resources like you can do so many things

1968.32 --> 1974.9199999999998
with colloidal silver it's crazy or

1970.36 --> 1976.99
silver in general and yeah baking soda

1974.92 --> 1980.02
is good for so many thing it is for

1976.99 --> 1983.5
medical purposes you can use it against

1980.02 --> 1985.36
cancer apparently and for food goods

1983.5 --> 1986.98
which is a healthy in general it's just

1985.36 --> 1991.4799999999998
crazy how much you can do with that

1986.98 --> 1997.3
stuff and yeah and then for example just

1991.48 --> 2003.53
look at vitamin C in general good for so

1997.3 --> 2003.53
many things anyway

2007.89 --> 2018.5490000000002
right uh see yeah I watched back

2016.75 --> 2022.45
yesterday show was pretty good pretty

2018.549 --> 2026.3799999999999
intense and I thought that I put down

2022.45 --> 2028.66
the existential issues good enough

2026.38 --> 2033.5400000000002
because it did it always kind of a nurse

2028.66 --> 2038.41
me every time I bring such things up but

2033.54 --> 2041.59
yeah it was good uh what else was going

2038.41 --> 2045.49
a lot of watched on Benjamin that was

2041.59 --> 2048.25
just great as usual he also talked kind

2045.49 --> 2056.429
of about this thing again what can you

2048.25 --> 2056.429
do like yeah

2058.53 --> 2063.119
share it some good memory videos

2069.07 --> 2073.6600000000003
what else was going on yeah I went to

2071.41 --> 2075.33
bed really early by the way it it was

2073.66 --> 2079.06
odd

2075.33 --> 2080.83
think like 12 o'clock I don't know I

2079.06 --> 2084.2799999999997
just got knackered I ate a hamburger

2080.83 --> 2088.15
with actual meat since a long time and

2084.28 --> 2091.84
it was really nice but then I just got

2088.15 --> 2094.03
really knackered really tired and just

2091.84 --> 2097.92
like couldn't keep my eyes open so I

2094.03 --> 2097.92
just went to bed extremely early

2109.05 --> 2115.0600000000004
hey yeah by the way that I feel good now

2112.69 --> 2120.01
but it was really because I also have

2115.06 --> 2121.24
drank some beers and I think that it

2120.01 --> 2123.3700000000003
might have been a combination or

2121.24 --> 2127.9199999999996
something that my body just isn't used

2123.37 --> 2131.14
to like eating hamburgers anymore but

2127.92 --> 2133.84
even though they like the fresh lattice

2131.14 --> 2136.15
and all that and that is kind of good to

2133.84 --> 2138.01
have that that was always the best part

2136.15 --> 2140.65
I guess about eating amber it's just the

2138.01 --> 2145.3300000000004
fresh lattice and I know that the

2140.65 --> 2147.1
Greenies tomato but yeah with the alkali

2145.33 --> 2149.77
did kind of sleep with the alcohol and

2147.1 --> 2154.0299999999997
that didn't feel very good when I woke

2149.77 --> 2158.08
up which was kind of early but I just

2154.03 --> 2162.28
kind of like hung around running bettin

2158.08 --> 2168.33
lazy tit out so yeah I eventually I got

2162.28 --> 2168.3300000000004
up at is it ten o'clock and I feel fine

2168.6 --> 2176.92
no way it was 11 o'clock right yeah

2173.74 --> 2179.1099999999997
again I gave the out the advice don't

2176.92 --> 2182.53
drink and then fall asleep you'll have a

2179.11 --> 2186.21
shitty night and yeah again confirmed

2182.53 --> 2186.21
that is indeed what happens

2221.9 --> 2227.08
what

2224.56 --> 2228.91
are you guys talking about let me get

2227.08 --> 2230.62
back to Chad I've been just talking and

2228.91 --> 2236.02
talking and you guys seem to be talking

2230.62 --> 2238.8599999999997
about other things you know fake

2236.02 --> 2238.86
conspiracy

2246.66 --> 2253.81
don't do that just don't insert any more

2250.9 --> 2258.85
wizardry nonsense then then there

2253.81 --> 2261.04
already is please I try not to you know

2258.85 --> 2263.23
I could think up a whole lot of nonsense

2261.04 --> 2266.5
with all of this a whole lot of it and

2263.23 --> 2269.82
it just I don't want people to get

2266.5 --> 2269.82
preoccupied with it

2270.57 --> 2274.23
not really

2272.19 --> 2276.2200000000003
[Music]

2274.23 --> 2284.77
yeah I know you're listening good

2276.22 --> 2288.6699999999996
servant it's just hmm sometimes I hope

2284.77 --> 2290.83
to get a bit more direct response I

2288.67 --> 2293.26
don't know what that is you know because

2290.83 --> 2296.29
that it rarely happens that people do

2293.26 --> 2298.42
that I tend to do it a lot when I'm in

2296.29 --> 2302.31
chat it's always like I'm directly

2298.42 --> 2306.88
talking to the person off the show I

2302.31 --> 2308.89
just do that it's rare that I get into a

2306.88 --> 2311.23
real conversation with somebody in the

2308.89 --> 2313.39
chat although I will respond to them

2311.23 --> 2316.86
everybody knows that everybody knows how

2313.39 --> 2321.25
incredibly consistent I am socially with

2316.86 --> 2323.2000000000003
my chat interactions well of course I do

2321.25 --> 2324.91
have certain moods sometimes and what

2323.2 --> 2329.1099999999997
everybody's got to know those sides as

2324.91 --> 2333.1
well but it seems that not a lot of

2329.11 --> 2335.5
other people do that a lot I guess I a

2333.1 --> 2338.5899999999997
lot of people that do watch my show life

2335.5 --> 2343.69
they just get stuck in their listening

2338.59 --> 2345.8500000000004
mode that maybe that is just something

2343.69 --> 2350.28
that is just a typical side effect of me

2345.85 --> 2350.2799999999997
talking I don't know what that is

2354.67 --> 2361.85
and yeah I myself am not like that

2359.11 --> 2365.33
especially when something somebody is

2361.85 --> 2367.7
like really showing peak oversight and

2365.33 --> 2375.71
all that I get really enthusiastic and

2367.7 --> 2378.3399999999997
like jump right into that I don't see a

2375.71 --> 2381.17
lot of other people doing that though

2378.34 --> 2385.09
but on the other hand what I do get from

2381.17 --> 2389.54
my chat a lot is very calm

2385.09 --> 2392.03
sensible responses with good energy so I

2389.54 --> 2394.64
do appreciate that and please do keep

2392.03 --> 2398.2400000000002
that up okay just keep just keep on

2394.64 --> 2402.5299999999997
going but sometimes I am surprised like

2398.24 --> 2407.99
why why does it only seemed to be the

2402.53 --> 2409.94
ballers that kind of get a bit pushy but

2407.99 --> 2413.35
they get pushy for the wrong reasons it

2409.94 --> 2413.35
seems it's just

2416.79 --> 2423.0
because I get pushy about ideas have you

2420.87 --> 2426.02
noticed that I do really do get pushy

2423.0 --> 2429.15
about ideas like trying to really push

2426.02 --> 2432.06
complex ideas through because people

2429.15 --> 2434.85
don't really take that you take it that

2432.06 --> 2436.89
easy especially because of the well some

2434.85 --> 2439.35
of the surreal conceptualizations that

2436.89 --> 2443.2799999999997
are part of it so I have to just Ram

2439.35 --> 2446.73
that through other people's I don't know

2443.28 --> 2449.2200000000003
there's people like concave errs yeah

2446.73 --> 2455.34
generally don't talk about that but they

2449.22 --> 2458.52
just forward their baseline concepts

2455.34 --> 2461.6400000000003
don't really get into it don't really

2458.52 --> 2463.86
get into the cosmogony not really a day

2461.64 --> 2467.43
just fall back on the model again

2463.86 --> 2469.92
and that's not the same as what I'm

2467.43 --> 2474.45
doing I'm literally just trying to open

2469.92 --> 2482.19
up new concepts on the spot I just try

2474.45 --> 2484.31
to explore right unicorns layer yeah I

2482.19 --> 2484.31
do

2488.13 --> 2496.7200000000003
yes good servant thank you I well I have

2491.47 --> 2501.58
to because yeah my brain my being I'm

2496.72 --> 2503.74
fear has been good yeah the the greatest

2501.58 --> 2511.5099999999998
challenge in my life pretty much overall

2503.74 --> 2514.5099999999998
from very young age on for me the

2511.51 --> 2517.119
pattern seemed to be that like oh I'm

2514.51 --> 2522.82
very smart I'm intelligent I get things

2517.119 --> 2525.609
very quickly and I'm very it's like the

2522.82 --> 2529.0
enthusiasm is fed in by just a positive

2525.609 --> 2532.0299999999997
love a love for creation love for the

2529.0 --> 2534.369
world but then as I basically go

2532.03 --> 2536.92
throughout the world and then I discover

2534.369 --> 2541.0
things that just show like that just

2536.92 --> 2546.3
break that feeling and then it it

2541.0 --> 2551.2
depresses me hugely and that is yeah I

2546.3 --> 2554.65
stumble and then I just fall flow down

2551.2 --> 2556.48
like a dried up leaf that guy had that

2554.65 --> 2558.4300000000003
happen a lot to me when I was young it

2556.48 --> 2560.98
doesn't really anymore because it's just

2558.43 --> 2566.89
yeah I'm more like a tree and not a leaf

2560.98 --> 2569.05
anymore I'm a tree now so I know that

2566.89 --> 2575.1299999999997
happens I know what is out there now

2569.05 --> 2578.5890000000004
it's finally caught on and the original

2575.13 --> 2583.9300000000003
energy that fed me this this enthusiasm

2578.589 --> 2588.7
this growth this I this simplified ideal

2583.93 --> 2589.81
view it is still there but I now just

2588.7 --> 2592.48
contain it

2589.81 --> 2597.099
in it within like I don't allow it to

2592.48 --> 2599.47
get damaged from the outside I have to I

2597.099 --> 2602.1400000000003
had to compartmentalize it in order to

2599.47 --> 2607.5099999999998
save it and not let it be ruined and

2602.14 --> 2610.17
destroyed just to adapt you know it was

2607.51 --> 2610.17
very tough

2611.49 --> 2621.22
[Music]

2617.549 --> 2624.67
but it is still there but at the same

2621.22 --> 2626.77
time I'm also very aware about the

2624.67 --> 2630.01
darkness now it's it so it's almost like

2626.77 --> 2635.44
there's these two things that coexist

2630.01 --> 2638.2900000000004
constantly and I'm just not allowing it

2635.44 --> 2641.17
to unify almost it sounds really

2638.29 --> 2642.94
mysterious like that I I don't know how

2641.17 --> 2649.39
to explain it any other way it's just

2642.94 --> 2652.51
like the idealist part of me has to

2649.39 --> 2657.069
learn that it can never be but that it

2652.51 --> 2660.67
should be dreamed about in order to

2657.069 --> 2662.68
create good things and to help to make

2660.67 --> 2664.23
the world a better place which is part

2662.68 --> 2668.2
of the idealism

2664.23 --> 2670.75
despite that the world technically from

2668.2 --> 2672.7
the other side doesn't seem to like to

2670.75 --> 2675.0
be helped really this is the nature of

2672.7 --> 2678.069
the individual the ego that just

2675.0 --> 2679.63
polarizes just says like I don't like

2678.069 --> 2682.8089999999997
that you're giving me really good advice

2679.63 --> 2686.65
because that makes me jealous so I'm not

2682.809 --> 2688.799
gonna take your good advice yeah yeah

2686.65 --> 2692.109
that happens a lot in the world

2688.799 --> 2694.839
so I have to keep these two things

2692.109 --> 2699.91
completely separate in myself in order

2694.839 --> 2704.25
to maintain it it's like two roots that

2699.91 --> 2706.7799999999997
can touch but they have to coexist one

2704.25 --> 2711.089
exists basically to protect the other

2706.78 --> 2716.17
but the other can touch upon the one

2711.089 --> 2719.109
it's I wonder if that is kind of even

2716.17 --> 2721.4500000000003
sort of reflected that system is maybe

2719.109 --> 2725.04
slightly reflected in a very functioning

2721.45 --> 2725.04
of society I'm not entirely sure

2727.22 --> 2738.0699999999997
but this is how I try to manage myself

2732.52 --> 2738.07
[Music]

2755.63 --> 2763.089
ooh yeah potential yeah

2760.46 --> 2766.4
Paul Roberts all that potential you know

2763.089 --> 2771.17
all that potential what potential ex

2766.4 --> 2774.339
like based on what exactly because the

2771.17 --> 2777.0190000000002
statistic so far don't really show out

2774.339 --> 2779.8089999999997
that there's going to be deaths of any

2777.019 --> 2784.839
significance even if nobody did anything

2779.809 --> 2790.4300000000003
to stop it it's just gonna be the flu

2784.839 --> 2792.5589999999997
less dangerous actually yes yes Paul

2790.43 --> 2795.6499999999996
Roberts I am willing to take that risk

2792.559 --> 2799.099
absolutely because I didn't I trust what

2795.65 --> 2802.759
I've learned you know I trust the data I

2799.099 --> 2804.849
trust my own perception of what is

2802.759 --> 2807.19
really real I don't listen to

2804.849 --> 2810.4990000000003
fantastical or terrible stories about

2807.19 --> 2815.839
super doom or could it be worse oh god

2810.499 --> 2817.3689999999997
oh this is it is bioweapon so therefore

2815.839 --> 2819.47
we must conclude that it was

2817.369 --> 2822.2290000000003
specifically designed to destroy all

2819.47 --> 2827.9889999999996
humanity that kind of nonsense

2822.229 --> 2830.4199999999996
is that what I'm gonna be led by I don't

2827.989 --> 2833.42
think so I'm just gonna go with the

2830.42 --> 2835.4300000000003
statistics what is real what is proven

2833.42 --> 2838.16
and realize also that things can be

2835.43 --> 2841.479
exaggerated or manipulated and then just

2838.16 --> 2847.969
still go by what comes out of it all

2841.479 --> 2850.45
using my own senses trusting on the data

2847.969 --> 2850.4500000000003
that I've seen

2851.26 --> 2857.1600000000003
[Music]

2852.599 --> 2857.1600000000003
and I'm yeah that's that's good enough

2865.41 --> 2874.3999999999996
so yeah you yeah Paul Roberts tell me

2871.04 --> 2874.4
tell me that

2882.34 --> 2886.7400000000002
before I ban you by the way because if

2884.83 --> 2890.29
you're gonna keep up this level of

2886.74 --> 2896.9799999999996
panicky nonsense then I will remove you

2890.29 --> 2905.2
from my chat but tell me what is your

2896.98 --> 2908.2
proof proof proof Paul Roberts one more

2905.2 --> 2913.7799999999997
message like that again in your band so

2908.2 --> 2916.75
what is your proof that it is gonna yeah

2913.78 --> 2919.6000000000004
destroy everything kill everyone what is

2916.75 --> 2923.19
your proof I don't want to talk about

2919.6 --> 2927.85
potentials okay

2923.19 --> 2934.32
estimates what is your proof what do you

2927.85 --> 2934.3199999999997
base that assessment on Paul Roberts

2944.78 --> 2952.9700000000003
yes yes Paul Roberts I will ban you for

2949.34 --> 2957.2000000000003
agreeing with every expert on earth yeah

2952.97 --> 2961.2099999999996
I will so can you be more specific

2957.2 --> 2966.9199999999996
instead of going by a story without any

2961.21 --> 2969.26
actual facts because yeah if everybody's

2966.92 --> 2972.05
saying it must be true right no no

2969.26 --> 2975.05
unless you haven't really learned

2972.05 --> 2978.29
anything in the last four years then

2975.05 --> 2982.1800000000003
yeah anything goes right anything goes

2978.29 --> 2987.98
then right well please provide the proof

2982.18 --> 2991.7
the proof oh so you don't claim to be an

2987.98 --> 2994.34
expert well if you're not an expert like

2991.7 --> 2998.06
that we get you just blindly trust on

2994.34 --> 3001.2400000000002
what other people are saying then your

2998.06 --> 3006.36
input is completely useless you're just

3001.24 --> 3006.3599999999997
being a dumb panicky person in jet

3016.85 --> 3024.23
yeah yeah that's really nice so have you

3022.07 --> 3027.6200000000003
taken any notice what experts have been

3024.23 --> 3029.9
saying because for whatever opinion the

3027.62 --> 3034.13
experts stand in some kind of media

3029.9 --> 3038.03
setup they do absolutely all tend to

3034.13 --> 3043.69
compare the situation and the dangers

3038.03 --> 3049.2200000000003
with the general flu the general flu

3043.69 --> 3051.52
which claims more lives on average been

3049.22 --> 3057.68
the corona virus as is already

3051.52 --> 3060.29
statistically proven so yeah where are

3057.68 --> 3064.1499999999996
you getting what is your data what is

3060.29 --> 3064.15
your data Paul Roberts

3070.64 --> 3077.66
yeah Paul Roberts when my cards broken

3074.119 --> 3081.6800000000003
who do I go to I go check out if I can

3077.66 --> 3089.41
figure out what is broken that's what I

3081.68 --> 3092.0589999999997
do you know but hey if you're just some

3089.41 --> 3094.759
random person that doesn't know anything

3092.059 --> 3097.3390000000004
about anything that they use yeah you're

3094.759 --> 3099.17
gonna go to the expert and they're gonna

3097.339 --> 3102.5589999999997
tell you what's wrong and then you're

3099.17 --> 3104.509
gonna pay the money and you still won't

3102.559 --> 3109.489
know what the [ __ ] is going on after

3104.509 --> 3112.43
that yeah yeah well you don't have to be

3109.489 --> 3115.19
a car mechanic just to figure out how

3112.43 --> 3117.14
your freakin car works you know you have

3115.19 --> 3120.619
to be a mechanic if you literally want

3117.14 --> 3122.69
to fix it yourself if you want to be an

3120.619 --> 3124.19
engineer about it isn't where yeah then

3122.69 --> 3126.0190000000002
you need to be a car mechanic but you

3124.19 --> 3128.66
don't need to be a car mechanic to

3126.019 --> 3130.999
figure out what could be wrong you just

3128.66 --> 3136.3999999999996
need to kind of understand how cars work

3130.999 --> 3140.48
or at least how your car works Paul

3136.4 --> 3144.559
Roberts so yeah it's a great example

3140.48 --> 3147.71
because what I just shared with you is

3144.559 --> 3150.38
exactly what I did with this I go check

3147.71 --> 3154.099
it out and then that's then I'll hear

3150.38 --> 3156.799
some sizing up opinion you know for me

3154.099 --> 3160.039
that skill is very important because

3156.799 --> 3162.92
then when I go to the garage and ask

3160.039 --> 3164.4500000000003
what is wrong with this car and then

3162.92 --> 3165.799
they ask me like what happened and I say

3164.45 --> 3167.18
okay this happened that had them and

3165.799 --> 3169.609
then I don't tell them what I figured

3167.18 --> 3172.999
out and then they watch what they're

3169.609 --> 3176.749
gonna do hey I'm out and then I will

3172.999 --> 3179.839
know whether they're trying to fool with

3176.749 --> 3182.1189999999997
me or something you know because I know

3179.839 --> 3183.23
a little about what's going on about how

3182.119 --> 3186.289
it actually works

3183.23 --> 3190.369
just from curiosity just because I kind

3186.289 --> 3192.98
of want to know and yeah then you can

3190.369 --> 3197.779
figure out how reliable with a car

3192.98 --> 3200.289
mechanic or is so yeah because you might

3197.779 --> 3202.94
be surprised that not all of them are

3200.289 --> 3204.5890000000004
really all that great there's

3202.94 --> 3208.88
among them that just like if they don't

3204.589 --> 3210.2599999999998
like you they'll just rip you off and if

3208.88 --> 3214.609
you don't know anything about your car

3210.26 --> 3217.4300000000003
yeah what's gonna what's gonna prevent

3214.609 --> 3219.14
you from just falling for it because if

3217.43 --> 3221.1189999999997
you don't know what what what your car

3219.14 --> 3224.45
is how it works they can tell you

3221.119 --> 3225.5
anything and yeah you don't know so it's

3224.45 --> 3231.109
just random

3225.5 --> 3235.22
oh yeah that's reality oh I'm missing

3231.109 --> 3237.41
the point Paul Roberts am i ah oh now it

3235.22 --> 3240.4399999999996
isn't about car mechanics oh you brought

3237.41 --> 3244.31
up the example I responded to the

3240.44 --> 3246.23
example an absurd detail completely

3244.31 --> 3248.359
relevant to the scenario and now it's

3246.23 --> 3251.48
not about the car is it not about car

3248.359 --> 3259.0099999999998
mechanic sauce that's that's really nice

3251.48 --> 3261.47
that's really nice of you if I suddenly

3259.01 --> 3262.13
experience severe abdominal pain who do

3261.47 --> 3266.48
I see

3262.13 --> 3271.01
well first off I see my parents and ask

3266.48 --> 3273.8
them have you ever had this if it's like

3271.01 --> 3276.3190000000004
if you can't really place it you have to

3273.8 --> 3278.869
learn about what it is first cuz this

3276.319 --> 3282.38
pain is not just did this was not just

3278.869 --> 3284.9
some typical thing like indigestion or

3282.38 --> 3288.38
so that was very different now I don't

3284.9 --> 3292.4
go to a doctor because I am NOT a

3288.38 --> 3294.859
suicidal [ __ ] [ __ ] Paul Roberts cuz

3292.4 --> 3296.569
you think that a doctor knows how to do

3294.859 --> 3298.8489999999997
with that know they're just gotta go

3296.569 --> 3302.7799999999997
I'll just get the paint away we're gonna

3298.849 --> 3304.67
try this you know they know that's not

3302.78 --> 3306.1600000000003
gonna help that was the whole freaking

3304.67 --> 3309.44
point

3306.16 --> 3313.31
you're an idiot Paul Roberts you are an

3309.44 --> 3315.38
idiot and you're going if you keep this

3313.31 --> 3318.2599999999998
up in life you're gonna go for a Darwin

3315.38 --> 3320.359
Award you're gonna fall into a trap you

3318.26 --> 3322.8190000000004
won't see coming and it's gonna kill you

3320.359 --> 3324.89
it's just gonna be a part of society

3322.819 --> 3326.869
just what happens that's what's got

3324.89 --> 3328.22
that's what's gonna happen Paul Roberts

3326.869 --> 3331.369
that's what's gonna happen to you

3328.22 --> 3333.02
if you don't figure out what the [ __ ]

3331.369 --> 3335.3
you're doing if you're going to rely on

3333.02 --> 3335.9
somebody else to tell you what reality

3335.3 --> 3337.01
is

3335.9 --> 3346.01
every single time that's what's gonna

3337.01 --> 3348.5
happen buddy Paula Roberts Oh all right

3346.01 --> 3350.15
no no no appendix is very different you

3348.5 --> 3354.319
know because that's very specifically

3350.15 --> 3357.529
local I had my appendix removed because

3354.319 --> 3361.339
yeah that's very different from this

3357.529 --> 3363.349
specific experience but hey you were

3361.339 --> 3365.42
pointing at this specific experience

3363.349 --> 3368.049
right and now your straw Manning me with

3365.42 --> 3371.329
supposed appendix not really knowing

3368.049 --> 3374.599
that I don't have my appendix anymore

3371.329 --> 3376.4300000000003
but then again you're just a stupid chat

3374.599 --> 3378.1090000000004
role now at this point and you're just

3376.43 --> 3382.7599999999998
trying to squirm your way out like a

3378.109 --> 3385.359
rumpus it's kind of pathetic and the

3382.76 --> 3387.8590000000004
only reason you're not banned yet is

3385.359 --> 3389.24
specifically because it is so

3387.859 --> 3391.339
embarrassing what you're doing right now

3389.24 --> 3395.27
in this chat and I don't want that to be

3391.339 --> 3401.93
removed at any cost so nobody dare burn

3395.27 --> 3403.579
him because this is special all right

3401.93 --> 3405.529
although I am gonna round out the show

3403.579 --> 3408.039
right now so yeah even the special

3405.529 --> 3412.4
