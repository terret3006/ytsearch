79.39 --> 81.96
crazy

83.039 --> 93.909
you whoa did you see that holy [ __ ] so a

89.229 --> 96.15899999999999
huge branch just broke off right in

93.909 --> 98.85000000000001
front of the camera down there right

96.159 --> 98.85000000000001
next to the car

102.049 --> 114.409
anyway yeah it's gone pretty wild and

110.56 --> 116.45
been rainy too and it's been stormy all

114.409 --> 121.32900000000001
nights I was a good really restless

116.45 --> 121.32900000000001
night or especially the morning for me

125.77 --> 128.76999999999998
what

129.28 --> 135.4
x2 two three

132.71 --> 138.31
that guy is not bad he's right there

135.4 --> 141.31
he's right there

138.31 --> 141.31
hello

149.23 --> 162.79
it's not banned anyway um yeah I got

156.33 --> 165.55
green tea with me today that's it and

162.79 --> 166.72
yes I said been quite Restless but still

165.55 --> 170.83
I'm feeling good

166.72 --> 174.1
although yeah sad to see the the morning

170.83 --> 181.69
reports from all the Flat Earth fronts

174.1 --> 184.15
that Mad Mike Rocket Man Mad Mike who

181.69 --> 186.64
have kind of like not I don't think I

184.15 --> 188.89000000000001
literally met her now I haven't met him

186.64 --> 192.16
like on a hangout or anything I have

188.89 --> 196.83999999999997
seen him talk and of course back in the

192.16 --> 201.519
day first came to my attention when the

196.84 --> 204.25
guy was a infinite plane Society kind of

201.519 --> 209.83
went on a media tour thing of his own

204.25 --> 212.29
and got in with that that's where the

209.83 --> 216.34
where I first basically heard of Mad

212.29 --> 220.03
Mike and he's he was a stunt man a stunt

216.34 --> 224.26
man for life and yeah it's very typical

220.03 --> 226.39000000000001
for fanatical stunt men that they

224.26 --> 229.06
eventually do end up in an accident

226.39 --> 232.66
unfortunately any pro was probably well

229.06 --> 237.94
aware of that but it's still tragic to

232.66 --> 241.009
see that happen and yeah

237.94 --> 241.009
[Music]

247.28 --> 261.299
you know being a stuntman is a dangerous

250.47 --> 264.72
occupation so yeah for the rest you know

261.299 --> 267.17999999999995
if technically I could go all conspiracy

264.72 --> 272.25
on it but I don't necessarily even want

267.18 --> 274.86
to but but there are things like my

272.25 --> 279.72
conspiracy nature does kind of pop up

274.86 --> 283.32
since he was kind of media invented in a

279.72 --> 285.63000000000005
way that like I almost start to wonder

283.32 --> 288.18
it's probably not true but it still it's

285.63 --> 291.18
popping up like ooh is he really dead or

288.18 --> 293.25
is this just like with the Hollywood

291.18 --> 295.62
he's gone underground you know I was

293.25 --> 297.479
it's the it's the conspiracy nature

295.62 --> 300.93
you're so used to media events being

297.479 --> 304.5
faked with somebody dead that is like in

300.93 --> 309.419
the media in some way in a bigger way or

304.5 --> 312.15
championing something it's see but it's

309.419 --> 314.27
probably just love he's a stunt guy that

312.15 --> 318.10999999999996
kind of [ __ ] happens

314.27 --> 321.03
certainly hoping it was by accident and

318.11 --> 324.289
nobody tinkered with the parachute that

321.03 --> 329.84
would be horrific but I don't know like

324.289 --> 333.59
that's not up to me to figure that out I

329.84 --> 333.59
don't have the data

334.39 --> 339.89
as for ya there of course there were

337.64 --> 341.59999999999997
gonna be responses from ballers like oh

339.89 --> 345.62
yeah finally one bites the dust

341.6 --> 347.39000000000004
literally and yay flattering finally

345.62 --> 350.15
good really deserves because yeah well

347.39 --> 352.4
no [ __ ] that's because the other side is

350.15 --> 355.58
city state of pretty much panic so any

352.4 --> 359.0
kind of end on the other side will fuel

355.58 --> 364.37
as some some kind of micro victory in

359.0 --> 368.51
some way enable just like the liberal

364.37 --> 369.62
extreme left or the Marxist will do that

368.51 --> 372.44
in their way

369.62 --> 376.34000000000003
yeah so well ballers do that in the face

372.44 --> 378.71
of flat earthers getting in bad [ __ ] and

376.34 --> 380.84
not all of them though you know there's

378.71 --> 383.65999999999997
still plenty of ballers even the more

380.84 --> 386.75
fanatical that do have at least some

383.66 --> 389.24
realization of social decency to some

386.75 --> 393.2
level so not everyone is gonna go too

389.24 --> 396.26
far with it but it will yeah it will

393.2 --> 398.71999999999997
typically happen in chats especially in

396.26 --> 400.37
comment sections because there's some

398.72 --> 403.37
pretty disgusting people out there

400.37 --> 407.77
they'll just that have no sense of

403.37 --> 415.19
morality social wise so politicized

407.77 --> 420.34999999999997
anyway yeah let's see use in chat rest

415.19 --> 428.06
in peace Matt Mike he is flat now like

420.35 --> 432.85
the earth okay X 320 was first Peter

428.06 --> 432.85
Harrington Geoffrey Bill AGM

435.04 --> 448.449
Missouri bear Amanda you won one rock

442.49 --> 456.199
hunt michael roark avignon cents see you

448.449 --> 461.06
ha good servant Stephanie and young

456.199 --> 467.86
Tennessee already see Dale I oh hi oh

461.06 --> 467.86
right and a Meakin morning and a koala

468.039 --> 475.43
all right so X 320 apparently had a very

473.18 --> 477.32
special dream about the edge and he

475.43 --> 478.76
claimed that I was totally right all

477.32 --> 482.8
along but I have no idea what he's

478.76 --> 486.639
actually saying kind of curious now

482.8 --> 486.639
dreams can be very fascinating

499.61 --> 507.599
it was a dream yes but it was true well

502.53 --> 510.96
maybe that's for you to figure out what

507.599 --> 514.8
about it was true and what was filled in

510.96 --> 517.3489999999999
by your own lack of knowledge that you

514.8 --> 527.76
can retroactively lis figure out later

517.349 --> 532.1700000000001
maybe the edge what edge since when did

527.76 --> 534.66
I claim an edge like if anything my my

532.17 --> 537.81
personal conceptualization of the the

534.66 --> 541.5
realm has no edge at all not even close

537.81 --> 550.459
the edge is a loop so it's just

541.5 --> 554.01
continual continuing in on itself it's

550.459 --> 556.7689999999999
ok ok well I guess you saw the edge of

554.01 --> 560.16
the earth in your dream fun with that

556.769 --> 564.41
but yeah that's not that's not what I've

560.16 --> 564.41
been claiming at all said very weird

572.96 --> 578.48
well explain okay see it like this

576.62 --> 582.38
every time we visualize something we

578.48 --> 584.3000000000001
always tend to project in our minds a

582.38 --> 586.45
miniature of something that we could

584.3 --> 591.5889999999999
potentially hold and then say that is it

586.45 --> 594.5
like a disk or snow globe no it's very

591.589 --> 599.9590000000001
tangible to our imagination very easy to

594.5 --> 602.54
get but I think a reality the realm is

599.959 --> 606.5
come to self-contained and looping so

602.54 --> 612.89
there is no edge the edge borders with

606.5 --> 615.07
the other side see it just it loops in

612.89 --> 618.62
on itself so there is no physical edge

615.07 --> 627.4100000000001
there maybe there's simply a limited

618.62 --> 632.899
amount of space in certain ways and yet

627.41 --> 637.1
that's it it doesn't have an edge maybe

632.899 --> 640.209
a edge above or an edge below but yeah

637.1 --> 640.2090000000001
that's even uncertain

643.99 --> 655.51
Oh God really chat Paul okay I guess the

653.2 --> 657.37
conversation get come up was it like in

655.51 --> 659.4399999999999
the after show yesterday or something or

657.37 --> 667.39
where did it come over did I bring it up

659.44 --> 673.6
I don't remember but yeah I think that

667.39 --> 676.51
flat earth in a way is like a it was

673.6 --> 679.96
inevitable because of the internet that

676.51 --> 682.78
it would spread so they kind of put

679.96 --> 685.45
things in place in order to not let it

682.78 --> 689.5899999999999
be as disruptive at is as it unfolds and

685.45 --> 693.0600000000001
certain players are also trying to move

689.59 --> 696.0400000000001
it around a little in their plans for

693.06 --> 697.93
originally to see if they can get some

696.04 --> 701.14
kind of advantage out of the the

697.93 --> 705.64
temporary chaos that would come from it

701.14 --> 709.63
the defiance from the waking up so it's

705.64 --> 713.47
very complex in a way yeah it was

709.63 --> 715.42
controlled but it's not forced it was

713.47 --> 717.46
always gonna happen but they put some

715.42 --> 721.78
control as to how it would happen that's

717.46 --> 724.9000000000001
how I see it they certainly took away

721.78 --> 729.76
the brakes just let it unfold naturally

724.9 --> 731.77
like it like no it was never it was

729.76 --> 734.38
never censored in a way that was kind of

731.77 --> 736.39
like oh yeah no you can talk about it

734.38 --> 739.0
now I literally started out like that

736.39 --> 746.02
saying like what we can talk about this

739.0 --> 748.72
now because before all of that every

746.02 --> 750.37
single time it came up in some way was

748.72 --> 754.36
always like me you gotta keep it to

750.37 --> 757.69
yourself or not even said it's just like

754.36 --> 760.3000000000001
the earnest of the whole thing made me

757.69 --> 762.7
do that and those people that I talked

760.3 --> 765.0999999999999
about were not fair they were very

762.7 --> 767.26
subtle so they were not basically like

765.1 --> 770.38
flat earth is how we know it today just

767.26 --> 775.12
be working it out there that was unheard

770.38 --> 777.81
of ten years ago twenty years ago the

775.12 --> 780.73
people that would do that would

777.81 --> 783.4899999999999
literally be considered crazy literally

780.73 --> 787.0600000000001
crazy remember that they would be

783.49 --> 790.51
considered like the bomb the doomsday

787.06 --> 792.6999999999999
bomb that was if you would be a flat

790.51 --> 794.47
earther back then and do that that would

792.7 --> 795.97
be how people would approach you yeah

794.47 --> 798.57
but they wouldn't stay away now it's

795.97 --> 801.37
different it's all different because

798.57 --> 804.1
people have been able to broaden their

801.37 --> 806.79
senses through the internet and just get

804.1 --> 810.4
a feel of things in their own way and

806.79 --> 812.89
the compartmentalization that the

810.4 --> 817.18
algorithms have applied to every

812.89 --> 820.33
individual have not prevented them from

817.18 --> 822.67
figuring themselves out to a certain

820.33 --> 825.19
degree and just figure out that there's

822.67 --> 828.18
more so they still kind of grew up even

825.19 --> 833.1300000000001
though they have been narrowed down its

828.18 --> 836.3199999999999
see it's you can't really stop it

833.13 --> 839.77
but back then 15 years ago 20 years ago

836.32 --> 842.9100000000001
it would generally be considered like

839.77 --> 845.17
even back then like if you were a 911 or

842.91 --> 848.16
like that you would be kind of shun

845.17 --> 851.74
they'd be like that's your disruptor is

848.16 --> 854.65
you know go with the show or go with the

851.74 --> 856.87
play or get with the state or we got to

854.65 --> 859.27
we got to do this you know that attitude

856.87 --> 861.82
but if you were like a flat earth or

859.27 --> 864.37
like a completely alternative figure or

861.82 --> 867.61
if you were super Pro aliens as well

864.37 --> 870.58
it's kind of odd they've got intertwined

867.61 --> 872.47
with nuttiness also back then although

870.58 --> 878.589
that has also been normalized sort of

872.47 --> 880.75
it's more generalized and yeah if you

878.589 --> 882.8800000000001
would go forward that you would be

880.75 --> 884.83
shunned so it would be very dangerous

882.88 --> 888.49
you would have to talk about it

884.83 --> 891.4590000000001
relatively a secret now it has changed

888.49 --> 893.38
because people have figured out it is

891.459 --> 898.5999999999999
not as threatening as it originally

893.38 --> 900.3389999999999
seemed because they have been able to

898.6 --> 904.48
use the internet despite the

900.339 --> 906.9100000000001
compartmentalization to feel around it

904.48 --> 910.63
could not completely be stopped and so

906.91 --> 914.02
everybody gets it better what it is that

910.63 --> 917.23
of what drives flat earthers now we have

914.02 --> 918.88
more information more power as well god

917.23 --> 923.65
we work things out but it's also

918.88 --> 926.92
basically driven by a need to overcome

923.65 --> 929.38
deception and that is very pure in its

926.92 --> 931.81
mission really did and general people do

929.38 --> 935.77
get that it's the baller fanatics that

931.81 --> 937.6899999999999
just want to hold on that get angry and

935.77 --> 942.27
bitter from it still so that

937.69 --> 946.3800000000001
polarization still is getting more

942.27 --> 949.75
emphasized but the general public is not

946.38 --> 953.11
it's not so more so much more distant to

949.75 --> 955.57
them you know people do talk about Flat

953.11 --> 959.02
Earth now in a remote way or even like

955.57 --> 963.84
yeah yeah it's silly or I don't like it

959.02 --> 965.9499999999999
or or yeah it's kind of cool or maybe

963.84 --> 968.6800000000001
like yeah I

965.95 --> 970.99
why not you know everybody makes up a

968.68 --> 973.66
lot of stories so why wouldn't they make

970.99 --> 976.48
up such an incredible story there's so

973.66 --> 979.48
many angles to how people can take this

976.48 --> 986.8000000000001
information to a certain level and just

979.48 --> 987.79
live with it and even thrive so yeah

986.8 --> 990.78
that's the big difference

987.79 --> 990.78
twenty years ago and now

993.05 --> 996.2299999999999
[Music]

997.75 --> 1004.12
yeah let's get back to Maureen

1000.46 --> 1005.44
constantly and I've also been listening

1004.12 --> 1008.25
to quantum consciousness and he

1005.44 --> 1013.87
typically does this kind of overview

1008.25 --> 1019.63
inside trinkets as well although often I

1013.87 --> 1022.6
do detect like a is it still a little

1019.63 --> 1025.24
bit of Solace if solipsistic tendencies

1022.6 --> 1027.43
not not discipline wise but still the

1025.24 --> 1030.97
like the darkness is still there pulling

1027.43 --> 1032.079
to it don't feel what it is still

1030.97 --> 1034.089
interesting to follow

1032.079 --> 1036.27
oh yeah and big bear of course own

1034.089 --> 1043.4199999999998
Benjamin yesterday was just awesome

1036.27 --> 1045.61
again and I wish I could remember

1043.42 --> 1047.3200000000002
exactly what he were talking about I

1045.61 --> 1051.8799999999999
just remember it was good oh yeah new

1047.32 --> 1056.23
videos was it that was so hilarious

1051.88 --> 1058.6000000000001
state somebody some bear made another

1056.23 --> 1060.3700000000001
cartoon video using the democratic

1058.6 --> 1063.4599999999998
debate certain scenarios and then

1060.37 --> 1067.1699999999998
inserted Owen Benjamin as an extra in

1063.46 --> 1067.17
there I love how that works

1067.32 --> 1071.8
they've done or I think it's that

1069.91 --> 1073.8400000000001
specific guy that's done that type of

1071.8 --> 1078.3899999999999
setup before it is really funny it's so

1073.84 --> 1081.73
creative and it does work it's hilarious

1078.39 --> 1085.3300000000002
it's like that that third guy that that

1081.73 --> 1087.91
basically is chatting the truth out on

1085.33 --> 1093.09
the sidelines being ignored it works

1087.91 --> 1093.0900000000001
it's funny mountain bear yeah

1105.45 --> 1113.51
all right so yeah I did watch both of

1107.85 --> 1113.51
them what else

1127.2 --> 1136.71
right also yeah yesterday at certain

1135.19 --> 1139.0900000000001
parts my hang I've got a little heated

1136.71 --> 1141.67
especially concerning the the light

1139.09 --> 1144.1299999999999
particle wave duality it it brings out a

1141.67 --> 1147.0
lot of agitation in me every time it

1144.13 --> 1150.5800000000002
comes up and I put it down exactly why

1147.0 --> 1152.95
but yeah I want to kind of apologize a

1150.58 --> 1157.84
social level at least to Karen B because

1152.95 --> 1161.38
I think I may have got a little bit too

1157.84 --> 1163.4499999999998
heated in in in her face and she

1161.38 --> 1166.0600000000002
probably did not appreciate that so I'm

1163.45 --> 1168.01
sorry like everything I said is still

1166.06 --> 1173.08
meant but I should have toned down the

1168.01 --> 1175.59
energy it's just it's kind of tough to

1173.08 --> 1175.59
deal with it

1182.32 --> 1190.72
okay thanks Bob Sinclar I appreciate

1185.38 --> 1199.18
that I I don't know about Randy though I

1190.72 --> 1202.15
have no direct proof of it but you gotta

1199.18 --> 1204.3700000000001
still be honest about that Randy

1202.15 --> 1208.21
despite whatever he does with his money

1204.37 --> 1210.37
and his gifts and all that he does get

1208.21 --> 1212.65
some really cool footage and he has in

1210.37 --> 1215.7399999999998
the past and he still works and he

1212.65 --> 1218.98
actually develops he figured out the

1215.74 --> 1220.9
shoaling okay so you got you got to give

1218.98 --> 1222.94
him credit for the things that he's

1220.9 --> 1227.1100000000001
actually done and that's it's kind of

1222.94 --> 1232.23
his redeeming factor to me so you know

1227.11 --> 1235.9799999999998
despite this coronavirus infatuation and

1232.23 --> 1238.45
and yeah and just other sceptic elements

1235.98 --> 1243.03
you got to give him credit for the

1238.45 --> 1243.03
actual Flat Earth research that he does

1247.71 --> 1254.89
yeah and he paired him gerunds again so

1251.62 --> 1256.03
yeah I think he's I don't know what's

1254.89 --> 1259.5700000000002
going on exactly

1256.03 --> 1262.54
I've got this very odd remote feeling

1259.57 --> 1263.8899999999999
about the whole situation like I don't

1262.54 --> 1267.46
know what Randy's doing in the

1263.89 --> 1270.97
background I wonder I hope he's not kind

1267.46 --> 1272.47
of like aggravating the polarization

1270.97 --> 1274.8
between the Flat Earth debates and

1272.47 --> 1279.82
quantum eraser and the Bob and Jaron

1274.8 --> 1282.22
groups because that would certainly be a

1279.82 --> 1287.32
good reason why sadly cozying up with

1282.22 --> 1289.81
them because he's openly opposed us but

1287.32 --> 1292.72
this all seems like such a waste of time

1289.81 --> 1296.05
to me it's it's just more food for the

1292.72 --> 1298.24
ego more polarization let's just really

1296.05 --> 1302.56
stop it I've personally put a lot of

1298.24 --> 1305.89
effort into basically getting the theory

1302.56 --> 1306.82
to cool off a little because he is a

1305.89 --> 1309.1000000000001
hothead

1306.82 --> 1310.6
yeah it's very blatantly obvious but

1309.1 --> 1313.05
that doesn't mean that other people

1310.6 --> 1313.05
should then

1313.28 --> 1323.09
just go in like that and it should just

1318.23 --> 1326.8
be like look we have our arguments we

1323.09 --> 1331.31
have our focus we have our limits and

1326.8 --> 1333.29
let's just do our own thing you know

1331.31 --> 1337.37
that would be a much more sensible yeah

1333.29 --> 1341.09
but on the other hand you know certain

1337.37 --> 1343.85
types of behavior do require a response

1341.09 --> 1348.02
I totally get that but let's let's just

1343.85 --> 1350.27
not make it any worse let's just drop it

1348.02 --> 1352.7
as soon as possible basically that's my

1350.27 --> 1355.8799999999999
advice on the whole thing then we can

1352.7 --> 1357.74
all move on and do our thing on the

1355.88 --> 1362.0500000000002
globe Buster's and on the Flat Earth

1357.74 --> 1362.05
debates and all that

1367.02 --> 1370.21
[Music]

1374.65 --> 1384.43
now he does I don't know Bob Sinclar I

1377.65 --> 1386.14
had I I have no no inside on that that I

1384.43 --> 1387.55
thought that could be true you could be

1386.14 --> 1393.25
literally just making that up

1387.55 --> 1397.3899999999999
I don't know I'm not hanging around

1393.25 --> 1399.61
there a lot these days you know but hey

1397.39 --> 1400.65
if he's doing that then he's doing it to

1399.61 --> 1405.09
himself

1400.65 --> 1405.0900000000001
that's his issue

1409.08 --> 1415.47
you know people have memories so this

1413.07 --> 1418.2
yeah there you know short-term memory

1415.47 --> 1422.91
issues may be somewhat lacking for some

1418.2 --> 1425.94
people but the social memory tends to

1422.91 --> 1429.45
not be so easily fooled on the long run

1425.94 --> 1434.7
once people figure out other people then

1429.45 --> 1437.01
they will remember so that's yeah that's

1434.7 --> 1441.8700000000001
part of the choice and I choose to be

1437.01 --> 1443.91
open and honest and fix all my mistakes

1441.87 --> 1447.3
for everyone to see as quickly as

1443.91 --> 1450.9
possible so I can move on and and keep

1447.3 --> 1453.6299999999999
on producing the keep bearing the torch

1450.9 --> 1456.6200000000001
he keeps shining that light and

1453.63 --> 1462.2900000000002
spreading it out and inspiring others to

1456.62 --> 1467.2199999999998
take well to grab it to also look to

1462.29 --> 1468.5
also bear the light of honor and shine

1467.22 --> 1471.63
into the darkness

1468.5 --> 1471.63
[Music]

1485.66 --> 1489.9
great number on a coronavirus yeah I've

1488.04 --> 1493.05
heard that he had some doubts as well

1489.9 --> 1495.21
that's good it's also look there's so

1493.05 --> 1497.94
many layers to the conspiracy I've

1495.21 --> 1500.73
already put all of them out one way or

1497.94 --> 1502.92
the other it's crazy so many angles to

1500.73 --> 1507.75
this and that can be latched on to

1502.92 --> 1510.8400000000001
certain levels of groups every level on

1507.75 --> 1514.11
every system can grab hold of it in some

1510.84 --> 1518.309
way and use it and so it's like a bad

1514.11 --> 1523.6499999999999
giant mess of a spell that everybody

1518.309 --> 1526.23
just can't help but use and that's kind

1523.65 --> 1530.22
of the problem that's it's it's a

1526.23 --> 1534.66
seduction to kind of use the scare

1530.22 --> 1536.94
tactics and it's almost like an

1534.66 --> 1538.679
open-market it's crazy

1536.94 --> 1540.8700000000001
although they of course they have like

1538.679 --> 1542.88
the official yeah you can't just claim

1540.87 --> 1546.33
somebody's gonna get infected or that

1542.88 --> 1548.91
kind of [ __ ] when it's none that's still

1546.33 --> 1551.4289999999999
the official narrative is still pretty

1548.91 --> 1553.02
much gonna decide where where things are

1551.429 --> 1562.8000000000002
gonna be officially effected and

1553.02 --> 1570.09
everything but yeah it's guys it it's

1562.8 --> 1572.25
basically the flu just the flu it's like

1570.09 --> 1575.82
the common cold except it's a little

1572.25 --> 1580.62
worse hey and there's there's just

1575.82 --> 1582.78
really yeah colds of nothing there's

1580.62 --> 1585.059
colds that may not be bad but they

1582.78 --> 1589.35
linger long and then there's colds that

1585.059 --> 1591.69
can suddenly get really bad but then

1589.35 --> 1595.34
after yeah with fever and [ __ ] and then

1591.69 --> 1595.3400000000001
after while it goes away again so

1597.91 --> 1604.25
that's always been there that that's

1600.32 --> 1607.82
that's the biome it's part of our

1604.25 --> 1611.3
biology and it in the very process of

1607.82 --> 1615.47
growing sick from that is also like part

1611.3 --> 1619.97
of the met our metabolic e-government

1615.47 --> 1622.88
met about meta metabolism it's part of

1619.97 --> 1627.95
it because every time that happens your

1622.88 --> 1631.2800000000002
body goes into like a overhaul and it

1627.95 --> 1633.56
fixes a lot of things or it tackles

1631.28 --> 1637.31
certain problems of D that normally

1633.56 --> 1641.75
cannot be tackled in the general life

1637.31 --> 1645.62
mode so yeah it's it's part of the biome

1641.75 --> 1649.37
that's what I see it and a lot of things

1645.62 --> 1652.25
about it our psychosomatic so I getting

1649.37 --> 1656.1999999999998
a cold is psychosomatically triggered

1652.25 --> 1659.06
more than it is some kind of infection

1656.2 --> 1660.71
really it is in my experience like

1659.06 --> 1664.58
people can have colds around me all day

1660.71 --> 1667.31
long it it doesn't do anything to me but

1664.58 --> 1668.99
then at another moment I may get like a

1667.31 --> 1671.87
little more stressed out with myself

1668.99 --> 1674.57
like the darkness creeps on up on me

1671.87 --> 1676.9699999999998
or I make it dumb mistake and almost

1674.57 --> 1678.9199999999998
poison myself or something and then

1676.97 --> 1682.49
suddenly I may get a cold like are

1678.92 --> 1687.0700000000002
nothing but because I am just so aware

1682.49 --> 1690.89
of what the cold is I then kind of start

1687.07 --> 1693.6799999999998
I'd let it do its thing and then phase

1690.89 --> 1697.4
it out as quickly as possible just press

1693.68 --> 1699.77
it back I can't explain it it's just

1697.4 --> 1703.64
it's an energy thing I push it back and

1699.77 --> 1706.1
then it retracts and then I made Mac at

1703.64 --> 1708.5600000000002
maximum just be a little bit sniffy

1706.1 --> 1710.3899999999999
maybe 5-10 minutes a day or when I just

1708.56 --> 1712.04
got out of cold while there kind of

1710.39 --> 1714.23
situations you know when the temperature

1712.04 --> 1716.96
changes around you that's then when can

1714.23 --> 1720.13
I get bit sniffy and then goes away it's

1716.96 --> 1720.13
so simple

1723.049 --> 1733.95
all these people I'm like what oh yeah I

1731.46 --> 1735.27
don't know what the problem with them is

1733.95 --> 1736.799
probably that they just don't eat

1735.27 --> 1739.649
healthy enough they doesn't really know

1736.799 --> 1743.25
what to doing so there's all this toxic

1739.649 --> 1752.1899999999998
crap coming on not with me it just does

1743.25 --> 1762.69
it only one in this house that drinks

1752.19 --> 1764.0700000000002
filled filtered water right sorry for

1762.69 --> 1767.94
taking so long I'll get back to I've

1764.07 --> 1770.12
been a bit long-winded recently man and

1767.94 --> 1773.429
also I have to make a comment about that

1770.12 --> 1776.039
the Friday show holy [ __ ] there I got a

1773.429 --> 1777.929
lot of room to basically just do my

1776.039 --> 1784.58
thing but just listening back to it

1777.929 --> 1784.5800000000002
Jesus Christ man I really needed like I

1786.049 --> 1789.899
really almost like put it all out there

1788.34 --> 1793.8799999999999
and talked over everything that was

1789.899 --> 1797.1299999999999
terrible I apologize to the world yes

1793.88 --> 1801.8090000000002
I'm sorry I guess I needed it for a

1797.13 --> 1803.64
moment but it was definitely not as good

1801.809 --> 1805.35
as I thought it was even though I had

1803.64 --> 1808.159
good moments I had good ideas but it's

1805.35 --> 1811.26
just that was too talky it's terrible I

1808.159 --> 1816.89
really need to put some attention back

1811.26 --> 1823.74
on this because I use the the rollin on

1816.89 --> 1825.99
like a what is it a millstone I kind of

1823.74 --> 1828.69
use it like a millstone and if it once

1825.99 --> 1832.11
it gets rolling then eventually the

1828.69 --> 1836.8500000000001
grain is gonna get powdered and get you

1832.11 --> 1840.9289999999999
get the goods as it were but yeah the

1836.85 --> 1845.1
rolling it takes a while and I'm kind of

1840.929 --> 1846.919
almost I'm getting so proficient in this

1845.1 --> 1848.9089999999999
process that I'm kind of like

1846.919 --> 1851.0400000000002
prioritizing just keeping the wheel

1848.909 --> 1853.89
rolling mostly so that I can

1851.04 --> 1856.44
attain that level but it other people do

1853.89 --> 1861.48
find it a little disruptive so I need to

1856.44 --> 1868.98
be very careful otherwise I'm just gonna

1861.48 --> 1874.38
ruin it again for myself I'm not

1868.98 --> 1884.49
blaspheming the Lord's name body I'm

1874.38 --> 1886.0500000000002
appealing to him don't don't be such a

1884.49 --> 1889.2
an exit airiest

1886.05 --> 1899.58
please I've explained it before when I

1889.2 --> 1901.77
say Jesus Christ it's not a curse a calm

1899.58 --> 1904.35
down fella no no but you're the one

1901.77 --> 1908.1
telling me don't blaspheme I find that

1904.35 --> 1910.6399999999999
kind of insulting you should know better

1908.1 --> 1910.6399999999999
hm

1920.88 --> 1924.3590000000002
[Music]

1927.89 --> 1935.0700000000002
all right you know in a way maybe I

1931.92 --> 1937.46
could even try to emphasize it but when

1935.07 --> 1941.73
I say Jesus Christ in frustration I

1937.46 --> 1946.47
could what I'm basically saying is Jesus

1941.73 --> 1949.83
Christ help me litora that's what the

1946.47 --> 1952.919
feel of it is it still I'm not putting

1949.83 --> 1955.29
my anger Love Guru Jesus Christ it's his

1952.919 --> 1957.8400000000001
fault to create his God's fault or so no

1955.29 --> 1960.059
that would be more blasphemous no I'm

1957.84 --> 1963.98
appealing to him I'm putting down like

1960.059 --> 1972.69
oh my god this is terrible help me Jesus

1963.98 --> 1975.99
see I mean it I'm I'm trying to be very

1972.69 --> 1978.63
careful with the way I use words so all

1975.99 --> 1981.02
right I'm glad you understand so let's

1978.63 --> 1981.0200000000002
move on

1987.99 --> 1995.73
right yet the word using god damn it

1992.39 --> 1997.8600000000001
it's more difficult it's more tough to

1995.73 --> 2001.22
step away because it is basically a dark

1997.86 --> 2004.87
emphasis and I do do it but I really do

2001.22 --> 2008.42
it when I feel that I'm already kind of

2004.87 --> 2012.31
stumbled into into a blind zone like

2008.42 --> 2015.29
when I get really first aid and I'm like

2012.31 --> 2019.46
and I make silly little voices to kind

2015.29 --> 2021.26
of make sure it doesn't get serious in

2019.46 --> 2025.13
any way because I don't want a full

2021.26 --> 2027.89
energy curse like that ever ever it's

2025.13 --> 2030.8300000000002
bad I have done that and even if you

2027.89 --> 2035.8000000000002
don't mean any wider arm with it the

2030.83 --> 2039.23
echo of it is bad it's not good for you

2035.8 --> 2041.78
but I still do do it sometimes but I

2039.23 --> 2043.7
just never want to do that in front of

2041.78 --> 2049.55
another person I always kind of do it in

2043.7 --> 2051.32
my own time and like really frustrated

2049.55 --> 2053.1800000000003
not like angry but just really

2051.32 --> 2055.5800000000004
frustrated about something not getting

2053.18 --> 2059.4199999999996
my way or whatever din oh my god god

2055.58 --> 2064.04
damn it but I know that's wrong so I

2059.42 --> 2067.13
always either tone it down or I'd yeah

2064.04 --> 2069.23
because I don't want to really put down

2067.13 --> 2073.4300000000003
the curse as is because I take it

2069.23 --> 2077.51
serious the sounds are in a way but yeah

2073.43 --> 2083.3199999999997
that's for you but I am not afraid to

2077.51 --> 2083.32
say Jesus Christ in a very specific way

2083.41 --> 2088.5499999999997
even in social scenarios in the open

2086.18 --> 2092.0299999999997
I'm just not because I'm appealing to

2088.55 --> 2096.34
him I'm appealing to him for help Jesus

2092.03 --> 2096.34
Christ helped me anyway

2098.98 --> 2105.23
[Music]

2100.15 --> 2107.69
right Marko bags I know the energy

2105.23 --> 2112.01
behind the words the people that's

2107.69 --> 2117.92
problem with atheism it by taking away

2112.01 --> 2120.98
God they also take away just the

2117.92 --> 2123.23
seriousness of the effects of our

2120.98 --> 2125.63
actions in a way you know that he throw

2123.23 --> 2127.369
us in this free void where nothing means

2125.63 --> 2130.88
anything and you can do whatever comes

2127.369 --> 2132.4700000000003
to mind but everything has a consequence

2130.88 --> 2135.29
and that's kind of what they're hiding

2132.47 --> 2137.93
by doing that and then they trick you

2135.29 --> 2141.46
into doing the craziest imaginable stuff

2137.93 --> 2144.3199999999997
with yourself and that's Society now

2141.46 --> 2147.369
everyone's seeing this this process

2144.32 --> 2147.369
getting worse

2148.45 --> 2151.5099999999998
[Music]

2162.16 --> 2169.96
right because words have power would

2165.279 --> 2173.68
actions and will have power but you got

2169.96 --> 2177.4900000000002
to take the responsibility and purify

2173.68 --> 2179.68
your actions and that have in the vision

2177.49 --> 2181.839
the direction and then it will actually

2179.68 --> 2184.269
be strong because if you don't take it

2181.839 --> 2186.43
seriously then it's just going to be

2184.269 --> 2194.7
flailing or around it's not going to get

2186.43 --> 2198.3289999999997
effective English language is a concept

2194.7 --> 2198.3289999999997
it's information

2200.91 --> 2204.12
[Music]

2210.78 --> 2217.48
right a gem but the thing is words in

2214.119 --> 2223.569
their ways are symbols as well you might

2217.48 --> 2230.26
have noticed the words are not just

2223.569 --> 2233.89
words words are just words when you just

2230.26 --> 2236.23
take it and isolate it away from

2233.89 --> 2238.2999999999997
everything else when you model it as a

2236.23 --> 2242.28
separate concept yeah and then it's just

2238.3 --> 2247.1800000000003
words the words and where they come from

2242.28 --> 2249.01
where they push things now that makes it

2247.18 --> 2251.68
a lot more complicated then words

2249.01 --> 2254.7700000000004
suddenly are not just words so it all

2251.68 --> 2259.1499999999996
depends on how far can you see and how

2254.77 --> 2262.599
much are you willing and able to account

2259.15 --> 2265.27
for what is more about words than just

2262.599 --> 2267.7000000000003
words how much are you gonna use the

2265.27 --> 2272.05
power behind the words I'm personally

2267.7 --> 2274.5099999999998
really do my best to to master this as

2272.05 --> 2277.9900000000002
much as possible I have all out my love

2274.51 --> 2282.28
all throughout my life to master the

2277.99 --> 2284.9199999999996
power of the words and purify myself so

2282.28 --> 2287.77
that the power does not become dark of

2284.92 --> 2289.96
the words that I'm using because yeah

2287.77 --> 2292.349
that could happen if you don't purify

2289.96 --> 2294.64
yourself while you are attaining power

2292.349 --> 2297.069
in one way or the other whether it's

2294.64 --> 2299.319
money whether it's power of knowledge or

2297.069 --> 2301.77
power of words power of influence all

2299.319 --> 2301.77
power

2301.89 --> 2306.3089999999997
if you don't purify yourself if you

2304.839 --> 2308.65
don't deal with the demons that will

2306.309 --> 2312.4
come and arrive when you attain a new

2308.65 --> 2314.4100000000003
level power inside anything when the

2312.4 --> 2318.089
darkness comes you don't take

2314.41 --> 2322.75
responsibility then it will take you

2318.089 --> 2326.799
maybe a little step maybe a big step but

2322.75 --> 2329.349
it will if you don't realize that when

2326.799 --> 2331.66
you attain new power immediately the

2329.349 --> 2333.46
responsibility falls on you and if it

2331.66 --> 2335.02
doesn't then you have a problem because

2333.46 --> 2337.839
then you don't know what your

2335.02 --> 2339.91
responsibility is and then the darkness

2337.839 --> 2342.21
could go wild with you because you don't

2339.91 --> 2342.21
know

2349.82 --> 2352.949
[Music]

2354.42 --> 2365.4700000000003
hmm all right

2359.1 --> 2367.96
that's funny IgM right I don't know

2365.47 --> 2378.27
power of words is something good to

2367.96 --> 2383.43
bring up now corpus Corporation it's a

2378.27 --> 2383.43
it's a dead fish vessel it's a machine

2386.55 --> 2396.01
what a corporation is and what a machine

2389.74 --> 2398.08
also basically is is they're humans are

2396.01 --> 2400.03
kind of all of like it too but the

2398.08 --> 2402.4
difference is we have a consciousness

2400.03 --> 2404.59
that makes the decisions we have an

2402.4 --> 2407.9100000000003
individual and it's been part of the

2404.59 --> 2412.2000000000003
design of creation machines and

2407.91 --> 2415.7799999999997
corporate entities do not

2412.2 --> 2420.37
they're basically starless only driven

2415.78 --> 2423.1600000000003
by the priorities the priorities they

2420.37 --> 2426.58
are set with their programs with like an

2423.16 --> 2430.0
animal in a way a very basic monster

2426.58 --> 2433.87
like animal so they are not living there

2430.0 --> 2436.57
a corpse and robots are too and yeah

2433.87 --> 2439.83
robot is only as good as the programmer

2436.57 --> 2439.8300000000004
has made the program

2443.64 --> 2453.1099999999997
but a corporation's function is very

2446.43 --> 2457.5299999999997
specific it is to harvest wealth and

2453.11 --> 2459.84
grow and feed all the human parts in it

2457.53 --> 2461.8500000000004
in order to keep on going keep on

2459.84 --> 2465.7200000000003
growing it's a very basic almost

2461.85 --> 2469.7
mushroom like priority system just grow

2465.72 --> 2474.27
just grow and expand and strengthen and

2469.7 --> 2476.6899999999996
compete for space and resources it's

2474.27 --> 2476.69
very basic

2482.84 --> 2490.3700000000003
but that's just the spirit of the

2485.3 --> 2492.92
corporation see it's very just a

2490.37 --> 2494.99
direction there's no real thought or

2492.92 --> 2499.7000000000003
philosophy or conscience behind it it's

2494.99 --> 2502.3999999999996
just a basic machine like a mushroom

2499.7 --> 2506.0
just growing it competing for space

2502.4 --> 2510.2000000000003
competing for resources fending off from

2506.0 --> 2522.56
the outside assimilating in to the

2510.2 --> 2524.54
inside what it can use yeah

2522.56 --> 2527.45
yeah and if corporations are the

2524.54 --> 2530.62
mushrooms then the humans are the Smurfs

2527.45 --> 2530.62
living within them

2536.64 --> 2539.81
[Music]

2557.09 --> 2563.32
they they want your corpse buddy

2562.16 --> 2567.62
[Music]

2563.32 --> 2570.0800000000004
well they that's the thing the

2567.62 --> 2573.3199999999997
corporation does not have a will it just

2570.08 --> 2576.61
has a system and the people within the

2573.32 --> 2579.23
corporation they're driven by their

2576.61 --> 2581.7200000000003
their need to sustain themselves or

2579.23 --> 2582.89
their selfish greed hunger to get more

2581.72 --> 2585.7099999999996
and more more MORE

2582.89 --> 2588.68
they will be the ones dragging in other

2585.71 --> 2592.55
people and making them part of the

2588.68 --> 2594.83
corporation so the corporation itself

2592.55 --> 2599.09
has no real will it doesn't do anything

2594.83 --> 2603.22
unless the people do things or unless

2599.09 --> 2607.67
the people program machines or the

2603.22 --> 2611.5699999999997
internet algorithms or whatever to do

2607.67 --> 2614.69
things in their name in a way in another

2611.57 --> 2618.82
way it's just the corporation does not

2614.69 --> 2618.82
have a will it just follows the program

2632.12 --> 2637.7599999999998
but you can think of it as having a

2634.49 --> 2639.1099999999997
spirit because it effectively does they

2637.76 --> 2641.1200000000003
come like it but it's more like an

2639.11 --> 2642.44
aberration this it's the spirit of the

2641.12 --> 2645.91
people that are in it that really

2642.44 --> 2649.4900000000002
determine where the corporation will go

2645.91 --> 2652.2799999999997
it's the insert of the people that alter

2649.49 --> 2654.5899999999997
its priorities its direction and all

2652.28 --> 2656.78
that that can change how it functions

2654.59 --> 2660.1400000000003
but the corporation in itself is dead

2656.78 --> 2662.3900000000003
it's not a conscious thing it's like a

2660.14 --> 2665.94
computer

2662.39 --> 2665.94
[Music]

2675.38 --> 2681.1400000000003
all right well Jeffrey bill that's a

2678.44 --> 2686.359
whole nother matter it's more that's

2681.14 --> 2689.45
like banker issues and I think it has to

2686.359 --> 2693.98
do with that this is how I see it I

2689.45 --> 2696.8289999999997
think that why they want that that like

2693.98 --> 2699.7
that the birth certificate issue and do

2696.829 --> 2702.4700000000003
like some kind of maritime law rights

2699.7 --> 2705.8289999999997
cuckoo what is it the possession right

2702.47 --> 2711.319
of all these people well they wanted is

2705.829 --> 2714.799
basically as in I don't know as an

2711.319 --> 2717.47
excuse for them to be able to do things

2714.799 --> 2720.109
they want to do because then they could

2717.47 --> 2723.6499999999996
kind of claim to higher entities to some

2720.109 --> 2725.66
kind of responsibility up there like

2723.65 --> 2727.5190000000002
yeah they we owned them

2725.66 --> 2729.8289999999997
we were trying to take care of them and

2727.519 --> 2732.47
we maybe have done a sloppy job but we

2729.829 --> 2736.119
did our best from our point of view that

2732.47 --> 2739.6899999999996
it may be something as bizarre as that

2736.119 --> 2742.1600000000003
because effectively they don't own you

2739.69 --> 2744.049
but they have like this it's like a

2742.16 --> 2746.359
contract they have like this we look we

2744.049 --> 2750.92
have a done contract officially we own

2746.359 --> 2754.8489999999997
so therefore we can put everything we

2750.92 --> 2758.2400000000002
did in another light see how that works

2754.849 --> 2763.279
I think it's more about that really than

2758.24 --> 2765.2889999999998
anything it's just an excuse for them to

2763.279 --> 2768.68
do what they want to do because

2765.289 --> 2771.65
otherwise they would be afraid to become

2768.68 --> 2774.3799999999997
more chemically they would feel the

2771.65 --> 2775.88
karmic consequences more in their minds

2774.38 --> 2778.4900000000002
I don't know about reality in their

2775.88 --> 2781.009
minds at least of what of what they're

2778.49 --> 2783.9199999999996
actually doing with people but because

2781.009 --> 2786.529
they think or because the way they

2783.92 --> 2789.41
officially sort of are contractually

2786.529 --> 2790.759
owning the people then they it's a

2789.41 --> 2794.72
different approach it's like they're

2790.759 --> 2797.599
cattle they are the ones that are taking

2794.72 --> 2800.569
care of them in the way they see fit and

2797.599 --> 2802.1000000000004
that like cattle yeah you might take

2800.569 --> 2807.5299999999997
some away as a

2802.1 --> 2809.87
or slaughter them it's yeah it's weird

2807.53 --> 2818.11
it's not my thing personally I think

2809.87 --> 2818.1099999999997
it's games it's mind games for the elite

2823.77 --> 2834.3
more and more ATM machines are being

2826.08 --> 2836.43
closed oh yeah I guess maybe it's also

2834.3 --> 2843.75
has something to do with more and more

2836.43 --> 2848.81
like ATM machines getting blown up maybe

2843.75 --> 2853.25
they want a more a better system for it

2848.81 --> 2860.16
that's not so yeah that that's so easily

2853.25 --> 2864.06
broken but I'll bet you they will

2860.16 --> 2867.75
probably fix it because a a completely

2864.06 --> 2870.27
cashless society is just very tough but

2867.75 --> 2871.89
yeah you can't then put it all back on

2870.27 --> 2875.09
to the backs there's just going to be

2871.89 --> 2879.56
another they're gonna probably

2875.09 --> 2879.56
revolutionize the system again

2888.42 --> 2894.01
you know what on the fly even I could

2891.25 --> 2898.74
think of ways to kind of bypass the

2894.01 --> 2900.42
typical blow-up the ATM machine type of

2898.74 --> 2903.25
robberies

2900.42 --> 2907.51
it would not be super efficient but it

2903.25 --> 2911.08
would be effective against that if it's

2907.51 --> 2913.11
effective then it's it stops that's how

2911.08 --> 2934.44
we're until they find something new to

2913.11 --> 2934.44
do are you talking about hey you can be

2989.75 --> 2995.56
what what are you talking about Marco

2993.29 --> 2995.56
backs

2998.31 --> 3001.82
all right make something an urgent

3000.35 --> 3006.0499999999997
problem so you can regulate it yeah

3001.82 --> 3011.81
that's how it always works it's make

3006.05 --> 3015.5600000000004
like it's a bureaucrat

3011.81 --> 3017.63
yeah bureaucracy just insert more

3015.56 --> 3020.5099999999998
bureaucracy to discourage until

3017.63 --> 3023.57
eventually things come become entirely

3020.51 --> 3027.2900000000004
banned it's a very old old political

3023.57 --> 3030.2200000000003
mechanism to gain control to gain slow

3027.29 --> 3030.22
slow control

3044.109 --> 3050.5989999999997
well Marco bucks the banks basically

3047.66 --> 3053.47
already have a cashless society you

3050.599 --> 3053.4700000000003
might have taken notice

3064.41 --> 3070.8289999999997
well the thing is Marko backs by if they

3068.789 --> 3074.46
would take away paper then they could

3070.829 --> 3076.319
potentially monopolize finances in

3074.46 --> 3077.9700000000003
pretty rigorous way and there would be

3076.319 --> 3081.0589999999997
very little you could do but they would

3077.97 --> 3084.0589999999997
be literally sitting on all on all the

3081.059 --> 3086.0690000000004
money and have so much control that we

3084.059 --> 3088.13
would not be able to do anything it

3086.069 --> 3091.319
would be absolute neo feudalism

3088.13 --> 3093.42
absoulute neo feudalism far beyond any

3091.319 --> 3096.329
kind of sci-fi dystopia that we could

3093.42 --> 3097.7690000000002
imagine and so they would have so much

3096.329 --> 3102.6600000000003
control to be nothing it would be

3097.769 --> 3106.6189999999997
Soylent Green but that's why we

3102.66 --> 3110.24
shouldn't get rid of paper that's why we

3106.619 --> 3114.119
shouldn't get rid of anything because

3110.24 --> 3118.5
barter is all about options it's all

3114.119 --> 3122.67
about options you can't put trade world

3118.5 --> 3126.779
trade all into one thing it's never it's

3122.67 --> 3129.7200000000003
never good it's always gonna play into

3126.779 --> 3131.519
absolute monopolized power in some way

3129.72 --> 3134.43
it's always gonna happen so it's so

3131.519 --> 3137.0389999999998
important that should be very many ways

3134.43 --> 3139.9199999999996
it should be national currency there

3137.039 --> 3142.0490000000004
should be cryptocurrency and there

3139.92 --> 3144.9300000000003
should be well yeah it should be

3142.049 --> 3148.049
digitally digitally transferred as well

3144.93 --> 3151.589
and it is but the paper system is very

3148.049 --> 3157.259
important just backup because it is all

3151.589 --> 3162.39
about wealth it's like how just how you

3157.259 --> 3165.089
call it agreements upon wealth and if

3162.39 --> 3168.089
it's all one currency it's one singular

3165.089 --> 3169.759
thing then yeah the one that regulates

3168.089 --> 3172.049
that it's going to become absolutely

3169.759 --> 3174.529
tyrannical over time it's almost

3172.049 --> 3174.529
inevitable

3177.61 --> 3183.03
[Music]

3179.93 --> 3187.44
cashless welfare cards that's fine

3183.03 --> 3190.02
give it look they can do that stuff

3187.44 --> 3192.69
everywhere everywhere everywhere ever it

3190.02 --> 3195.18
doesn't matter the only thing that

3192.69 --> 3197.52
matters is if if they're gonna make it

3195.18 --> 3199.8489999999997
the only option left then you got a

3197.52 --> 3199.849
problem

3215.55 --> 3218.55
right

3221.03 --> 3228.4100000000003
no it's not it's it's still unfolding

3225.11 --> 3230.48
it's like a slow cascade it's not

3228.41 --> 3234.1099999999997
everywhere stop being so paranoid please

3230.48 --> 3238.85
it's slowly unfolding it has for 60

3234.11 --> 3242.15
years placed much more probably but what

3238.85 --> 3245.7799999999997
we're seeing the globalism it's a it's a

3242.15 --> 3249.8
ripple it keeps on going piece by piece

3245.78 --> 3256.0400000000004
everywhere always the same it's not

3249.8 --> 3257.9300000000003
there yet it's not the end it's a

3256.04 --> 3260.7799999999997
learning process every bit of it and

3257.93 --> 3263.0899999999997
every region are gonna all have to face

3260.78 --> 3265.3700000000003
like oh we made so much fun of the other

3263.09 --> 3268.13
countries that screwed themselves over

3265.37 --> 3270.23
and now we're screwing ourselves over so

3268.13 --> 3272.9300000000003
we have only ourselves to blame and

3270.23 --> 3274.94
that's maybe the only way to learn for a

3272.93 --> 3277.1499999999996
lot of people or just keep banging their

3274.94 --> 3282.76
head in the wall until they're dead

3277.15 --> 3287.6
gotta get over it get over this freaking

3282.76 --> 3290.69
communist nonsense he's taking away of

3287.6 --> 3296.27
the senses and dehumanizing of this

3290.69 --> 3303.29
system sweat it out let it let it come

3296.27 --> 3308.66
and reject it trust yourself trust human

3303.29 --> 3311.93
nature trust that you'll have enough

3308.66 --> 3314.21
trust God don't go with that just don't

3311.93 --> 3317.96
go with that and if you do you're gonna

3314.21 --> 3321.2
be horrific Lee sorry horrifically sorry

3317.96 --> 3323.21
almost everything you did it for in your

3321.2 --> 3325.24
mind you held up in your mind while you

3323.21 --> 3327.89
thought it was a good idea all of that

3325.24 --> 3330.83
specifically probably is gonna be

3327.89 --> 3334.67
absolutely destroyed killed or ruined

3330.83 --> 3338.98
poised forever that's the consequence of

3334.67 --> 3341.7200000000003
what you do when you get into that

3338.98 --> 3343.76
everything you hold there everything you

3341.72 --> 3346.04
thought you were doing this for it's all

3343.76 --> 3352.09
gonna be destroyed all of it

3346.04 --> 3352.09
eventually unless you step away in time

3352.569 --> 3357.92
so it's yeah it's up to every country to

3356.39 --> 3361.1299999999997
deal with it are you are you gonna let

3357.92 --> 3362.779
these insane people deregulate

3361.13 --> 3364.099
everything until there's everybody's

3362.779 --> 3365.809
just dancing like a bunch of crazy

3364.099 --> 3369.23
puppets and don't know what the hell is

3365.809 --> 3373.4
going on in here what's real or you're

3369.23 --> 3374.89
gonna stop it say screw you we're gonna

3373.4 --> 3377.539
figure it out we're gonna grow

3374.89 --> 3382.359
self-sufficient we're gonna be humans

3377.539 --> 3385.3590000000004
and you're not gonna stop us it's up to

3382.359 --> 3388.509
every country every town every

3385.359 --> 3391.779
individual every family everywhere

3388.509 --> 3394.94
everywhere in the world there's no place

3391.779 --> 3398.63
the realm we know where it's not gonna

3394.94 --> 3402.109
be everyone is gonna have to figure it

3398.63 --> 3406.96
out and make the right choice or get

3402.109 --> 3406.96
dragged down with the Beast

3414.13 --> 3417.9100000000003
then the process has been going for a

3416.109 --> 3421.24
while so are we going to learn the

3417.91 --> 3423.3689999999997
lessons of all the mistakes or are you

3421.24 --> 3426.1899999999996
going to keep on being a freaking idiot

3423.369 --> 3430.359
and let everything crumble in your

3426.19 --> 3432.25
foolish idiot dream an idiot dream

3430.359 --> 3435.7
that's what it is that's what guides all

3432.25 --> 3437.289
that an idiot dream and I'm pretty

3435.7 --> 3439.72
embarrassed to say that at one point in

3437.289 --> 3441.9100000000003
my life I actually believed it until I

3439.72 --> 3444.43
figured out that the ones that actually

3441.91 --> 3446.5
oversee it and deal with it aren't just

3444.43 --> 3451.109
playing with it they don't believe it

3446.5 --> 3460.96
they believe in nothing and they're evil

3451.109 --> 3463.66
they have no respect for anything and

3460.96 --> 3468.2200000000003
the sooner you wake up to that the

3463.66 --> 3474.16
better anyway I think I'm gonna run out

3468.22 --> 3478.5389999999998
to show again

3474.16 --> 3485.89
yeah rest in peace Mad Mike flapped like

3478.539 --> 3488.25
the earth now and yeah alright that's

3485.89 --> 3488.25
Sunday

3492.63 --> 3500.38
yes thumbs up oh man you got to look at

3496.42 --> 3502.33
my show yesterday say like I thought it

3500.38 --> 3507.19
was a really good show I'm very proud of

3502.33 --> 3512.13
it little bit nervous always when I just

3507.19 --> 3516.84
put in really deep stuff but it's just

3512.13 --> 3520.1400000000003
I'm looking right now at the votes

3516.84 --> 3524.92
yesterday's show and it's six up votes

3520.14 --> 3528.22
like serious there's two hundred eighty

3524.92 --> 3530.29
three fuse and I got six of us makes no

3528.22 --> 3533.14
sense to me I think that probably a lot

3530.29 --> 3535.96
more people did not vote but it just

3533.14 --> 3540.0699999999997
doesn't register it doesn't show it just

3535.96 --> 3545.65
doesn't so YouTube just does not want my

3540.07 --> 3548.23
show to look like anybody cares they're

3545.65 --> 3550.6600000000003
very afraid that people might catch wind

3548.23 --> 3554.8
that I'm actually talking about some

3550.66 --> 3558.19
real condensed stuff hair that reaches

3554.8 --> 3561.5800000000004
beyond normal regular conscious regular

3558.19 --> 3565.75
base conscious regular six the earthly

3561.58 --> 3571.359
and they don't like it it's not safe for

3565.75 --> 3575.849
them but yeah I thrive in it and I'm

3571.359 --> 3579.79
gonna keep on bearing the flame of Anor

3575.849 --> 3584.8300000000004
till the end till or until I can no

3579.79 --> 3586.7799999999997
longer so I so yeah till I falter I

3584.83 --> 3588.5699999999997
break I can't guarantee that I can do

3586.78 --> 3592.15
this the rest of my life but I'm

3588.57 --> 3594.31
certainly seem to be I'm very capable of

3592.15 --> 3596.29
doing it now and I am seeing where it

3594.31 --> 3598.2999999999997
goes I don't know what eventually at the

3596.29 --> 3600.16
end of this trip will wheeling that

3598.3 --> 3605.349
flame of Honor in the dark I don't know

3600.16 --> 3610.66
what I will eventually end up opposing

3605.349 --> 3614.349
or finding I don't know I I really do

3610.66 --> 3618.79
not its is one of the things that were

3614.349 --> 3620.6800000000003
very persistently concealed from my

3618.79 --> 3622.0
conscious even within the dark world

3620.68 --> 3624.73
experience because they had an

3622.0 --> 3625.27
alternative thing that they wanted me to

3624.73 --> 3628.03
believe

3625.27 --> 3630.1
what's going to happen to me that have

3628.03 --> 3631.6000000000004
already kind of disproven so they

3630.1 --> 3632.98
concealed where it's going to end from

3631.6 --> 3634.2999999999997
it's kind of exciting that there's

3632.98 --> 3637.18
something that I'm pretty sure I don't

3634.3 --> 3640.1200000000003
know not even in my visions but I will

3637.18 --> 3644.1299999999997
continue wielding the flame of Anor as I

3640.12 --> 3644.13
love to call it that

3645.12 --> 3651.2799999999997
there's something very ancient to it and

3648.24 --> 3651.7
