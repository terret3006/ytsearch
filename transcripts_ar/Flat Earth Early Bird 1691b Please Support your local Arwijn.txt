1.199 --> 5.46
do it

2.48 --> 7.259
and I'm back hello hello

5.46 --> 8.94
here's the second

7.259 --> 11.280000000000001
very short

8.94 --> 14.28
part of a flat Earth early bird number

11.28 --> 14.28
1691

15.059 --> 21.06
hope you people will find me soon

18.72 --> 25.259999999999998
for some bizarre reason

21.06 --> 28.259999999999998
the chat got completely Frozen I even I

25.26 --> 32.34
wasn't able to say anything in it

28.26 --> 36.68
ah well steamy traveler first in chat so

32.34 --> 36.68000000000001
the chat seems to be working again great

36.78 --> 41.28
I was wondering like why the hell didn't

39.18 --> 43.98
anybody say anything for a 50 minutes

41.28 --> 48.44
straight that was just crazy

43.98 --> 48.44
you had my chat on subscriber mode

48.66 --> 55.398999999999994
yeah

50.7 --> 55.399
I always have my chat on subscriber mode

62.66 --> 68.29899999999999
otherwise I I get overrun with sock

65.82 --> 68.29899999999999
trolls

71.659 --> 78.02000000000001
foreign

73.38 --> 78.02
hello insanity is sanity good to see you

108.73 --> 113.03
[Music]

120.72 --> 126.079
all right Insanity Sandy

126.18 --> 131.479
I'm disappointed you didn't come and pay

128.52 --> 131.479
me a visit or something

131.76 --> 133.76
okay

138.959 --> 143.54
what

140.94 --> 143.54
wow

149.34 --> 155.12
okay it would be nice to speak on Earth

151.8 --> 155.12
okay turret

158.7 --> 164.099
Francis Bacon

161.94 --> 167.12
writer is Shakespeare play who gives

164.099 --> 167.11999999999998
okay I don't care

172.08 --> 174.62
sure

177.739 --> 183.239
the point is is that the scientific

180.06 --> 185.34
method is unchanging

183.239 --> 187.98000000000002
method doesn't change and the results

185.34 --> 190.14000000000001
that you attain from the method don't

187.98 --> 191.879
change that was the point that I was

190.14 --> 195.92
trying to make for the last 20 minutes

191.879 --> 195.92
and then the chat just died

197.28 --> 199.76
hmm

220.94 --> 223.94
thank you

228.0 --> 233.84
why does Google many other sources claim

230.7 --> 233.83999999999997
that science doesn't prove anything

234.599 --> 238.879
because they're trying to cover their

236.459 --> 238.879
tracks

239.519 --> 244.08
yeah first they claim science proves

242.22 --> 247.76
everything and that they have the

244.08 --> 247.76000000000002
authority of Science and that Sciences

248.94 --> 252.78
that part of science is like drawing a

250.739 --> 254.04
conclusion and having peer review and

252.78 --> 257.04
all that

254.04 --> 259.38
but then when you actually look it up

257.04 --> 261.90000000000003
and in the origins of the scientific

259.38 --> 264.54
method and all that well it tells you

261.9 --> 266.52
that all that [ __ ] that they're doing is

264.54 --> 269.1
complete [ __ ] and has absolutely nothing

266.52 --> 270.24
to do with science

269.1 --> 276.97900000000004
so

270.24 --> 276.979
to avoid people from going that route

277.86 --> 285.12
is basically a deterrent from further

281.28 --> 287.46
investigation they start yapping their

285.12 --> 290.12
mouths off and saying science doesn't

287.46 --> 290.12
prove anything

290.16 --> 296.90000000000003
it's literally an off obfuscation and

293.759 --> 296.90000000000003
confusion tactic

298.44 --> 305.12
and the straight to your face lie

301.639 --> 305.12
on top of that

315.84 --> 322.46
I mean scientific source to prove no the

318.66 --> 322.46000000000004
scientific method is the source

323.46 --> 328.94
I don't need any freaking sources to

326.28 --> 328.94
tell me

329.22 --> 331.88000000000005
what

334.02 --> 337.74
I don't need a source to tell me that

335.759 --> 339.24
science proves things yeah the

337.74 --> 343.74
scientific method

339.24 --> 346.259
is about proving the cause of an effect

343.74 --> 349.08
that's just what it is

346.259 --> 352.02000000000004
I don't need anybody to tell me that

349.08 --> 354.96
about the scientific method that it

352.02 --> 358.32
proves or disproves the cause of an

354.96 --> 361.82
effect is literally what it is it's

358.32 --> 361.82
literally just that

362.639 --> 367.139
if it

364.68 --> 369.539
if signs wouldn't prove anything then

367.139 --> 371.22
there is no science then it doesn't

369.539 --> 375.12
exist because

371.22 --> 378.66
all that science does is prove things

375.12 --> 381.419
that's the only thing it can do

378.66 --> 384.84000000000003
and that what it was designed to do to

381.419 --> 387.06
always have a result

384.84 --> 389.81899999999996
so that you will always know whether

387.06 --> 390.979
something is the cause of an effect or

389.819 --> 394.02000000000004
not

390.979 --> 396.3
you will always have a result it always

394.02 --> 399.9
proves something it proves something to

396.3 --> 403.1
be true or something to be not true

399.9 --> 403.09999999999997
always prove something

419.96 --> 425.78
no logical conclusion everything you

422.88 --> 429.12
just said is completely incorrect

425.78 --> 432.73999999999995
everything you just said is absolutely

429.12 --> 432.74
incorrect yeah

438.18 --> 446.039
having to be open to new discovery has

442.68 --> 449.34000000000003
nothing to do with science

446.039 --> 451.86
once you've proven something using the

449.34 --> 455.039
scientific method it doesn't [ __ ]

451.86 --> 457.68
matter what you discover after that

455.039 --> 463.31899999999996
whatever you're going to discover after

457.68 --> 466.02
that is still gonna not disprove

463.319 --> 468.41900000000004
that what was proven with the scientific

466.02 --> 470.46
method that's still gonna happen

468.419 --> 471.9
it's still going to be repeatable and

470.46 --> 474.96
having the same result

471.9 --> 476.58
whatever you prove to be the cause of an

474.96 --> 477.96
effect using the scientific method

476.58 --> 482.599
doesn't change

477.96 --> 482.599
a new discovery doesn't change

483.18 --> 488.16
that that thing that you varied and

485.699 --> 490.199
manipulated causes the effect that you

488.16 --> 493.40000000000003
presumed it would

490.199 --> 493.40000000000003
it will never change

493.44 --> 498.84
right now your new discovery might add

496.38 --> 502.199
on to like hey I discovered this other

498.84 --> 505.61999999999995
thing that also causes that effect

502.199 --> 507.90000000000003
and they can completely isolate that

505.62 --> 510.12
other thing that caused it

507.9 --> 512.6999999999999
and then then check this thing out and

510.12 --> 516.24
pure in its influence exclusively right

512.7 --> 518.94
like water boiling you could say okay

516.24 --> 521.099
I'm gonna cause this water to boil using

518.94 --> 522.9590000000001
heat scientifically proven you introduce

521.099 --> 525.6
heat to keep introducing heat it's gonna

522.959 --> 528.14
boil eventually it will happen

525.6 --> 532.4590000000001
but now let's see

528.14 --> 532.459
what a vacuum does

532.56 --> 536.3389999999999
a super low

534.779 --> 539.519
pressure

536.339 --> 541.5
does that cause the water to boil

539.519 --> 544.08
and leave the temperature at a perfect

541.5 --> 547.22
neutral neutrality

544.08 --> 547.22
Camp room temperature

547.74 --> 552.9590000000001
and then yeah water in that vacuum

550.74 --> 554.82
chamber Evacuate the gas well guess what

552.959 --> 556.8599999999999
that water is going to boil it's going

554.82 --> 560.0400000000001
to boil until it's all gone all sucked

556.86 --> 561.36
out with with the vacuum suck

560.04 --> 564.779
engine

561.36 --> 567.779
yeah so yeah vacuum

564.779 --> 570.54
even though arguably not entirely a

567.779 --> 572.9399999999999
natural phenomenon although Vacuums in

570.54 --> 577.0799999999999
very small scale do actually exist

572.94 --> 578.2790000000001
within nature even within life itself

577.08 --> 580.5600000000001
right

578.279 --> 583.74
that's kind of the way but in a small

580.56 --> 587.2199999999999
scale like fish bladders are pressurized

583.74 --> 592.019
little things and there are like plants

587.22 --> 596.839
that use basically very lower pressure

592.019 --> 596.839
systems to transport water

597.959 --> 602.0999999999999
always have to be some air yeah but it's

599.7 --> 604.9200000000001
not necessarily about the air though

602.1 --> 608.279
it's about lower pressure

604.92 --> 610.74
right so you lowering the pressure

608.279 --> 613.68
within a contained system that has water

610.74 --> 616.8
in it will cause the water to boil

613.68 --> 619.8599999999999
if you continue to decrease the gas

616.8 --> 622.3199999999999
pressure within that system the water

619.86 --> 625.38
will eventually boil so you can prove

622.32 --> 627.0
that lowering pressure causes water to

625.38 --> 629.459
boil

627.0 --> 631.26
it's scientific it follows the

629.459 --> 636.18
scientific method every time that is

631.26 --> 639.12
done it will result in the water boiling

636.18 --> 641.279
not through heat but through lowering

639.12 --> 644.3
the pressure

641.279 --> 644.3
that's a fact

649.56 --> 656.42
it will boil

651.72 --> 656.4200000000001
it will even look like boiling

657.0 --> 664.079
it will look just like as if you heat it

660.839 --> 667.6400000000001
that container instead of drawing a

664.079 --> 667.64
vacuum in it it will look the same

671.76 --> 680.16
right well proving that lowering the

675.899 --> 684.18
pressure causes water to boil doesn't

680.16 --> 687.079
prove water boiling because of heat to

684.18 --> 687.079
be incorrect

687.12 --> 693.68
it doesn't disprove that both do both

691.019 --> 693.68
cause it

694.38 --> 698.0
yeah

696.839 --> 700.6800000000001
and

698.0 --> 701.579
lowering the pressure causing water to

700.68 --> 705.2399999999999
boil

701.579 --> 708.0
will forever be it will always exist

705.24 --> 709.74
it's proven you prove that you do that

708.0 --> 712.14
and no matter what you're going to

709.74 --> 714.899
figure out in the future

712.14 --> 718.22
lowering the pressure will always result

714.899 --> 718.22
in water boiling

718.38 --> 722.1
because

719.64 --> 724.26
that's just what happens it's

722.1 --> 726.779
scientifically proven and nothing in the

724.26 --> 729.0
future is gonna undo that it's gonna

726.779 --> 733.8
always happen

729.0 --> 733.8
just like the experiment predicts

738.839 --> 744.8000000000001
even if the heat is very low

741.24 --> 744.8
well if the heat

744.86 --> 751.26
introduced into the water

748.2 --> 755.0400000000001
is going to disperse away from the water

751.26 --> 759.18
if basically the heat that's introduced

755.04 --> 762.779
is less than the standard amount of

759.18 --> 765.3
entropy the the water losing the heat

762.779 --> 768.8389999999999
naturally because it will lose if you

765.3 --> 771.0
leave things to to rest hot water will

768.839 --> 773.22
eventually grow cold right

771.0 --> 777.3
so if the amount of heat you're

773.22 --> 780.1800000000001
introducing into the water is not enough

777.3 --> 784.4399999999999
to overcome the entropy of it naturally

780.18 --> 788.66
cooling off again then no it won't boil

784.44 --> 792.12
but that's why the quantity

788.66 --> 795.18
of heat energy whatever is not

792.12 --> 796.5600000000001
Quantified that's why I didn't quantify

795.18 --> 798.66
anything

796.56 --> 802.7399999999999
yeah you see the scientific method

798.66 --> 806.399
doesn't need any form

802.74 --> 811.2
any form of quantification there's no

806.399 --> 815.839
math involved no numbers nothing

811.2 --> 815.839
there's only the cause of an effect

817.079 --> 822.54
yeah you introduce that effect

820.26 --> 824.399
it's gonna have to be enough to overcome

822.54 --> 826.519
natural entropy

824.399 --> 829.5
right

826.519 --> 831.839
lighting a match

829.5 --> 835.44
right next to a

831.839 --> 837.48
uh what is it

835.44 --> 840.4200000000001
a giant pool

837.48 --> 843.98
is not going to be enough Heat

840.42 --> 847.9799999999999
to overcome that giant body of water

843.98 --> 850.38
its natural tendency to transition from

847.98 --> 852.12
hot to cold it's not gonna heat it up

850.38 --> 853.92
it's not going to be enough

852.12 --> 857.82
right

853.92 --> 860.399
that's why quantity is not relevant it's

857.82 --> 862.86
about introducing heat and more heat

860.399 --> 865.079
it's basically introducing as much heat

862.86 --> 866.5790000000001
as you possibly can and if you'd like

865.079 --> 871.079
unleash

866.579 --> 872.88
like giant blue gas flame amounts of

871.079 --> 876.3
heat that would get thousands of degrees

872.88 --> 879.779
or more and you introduce that to some

876.3 --> 882.0
body of water it will freaking boil it

879.779 --> 884.9399999999999
will boil it will boil always it will

882.0 --> 887.88
always boil it's it's so much heat

884.94 --> 889.6800000000001
there's no way it's going to be able to

887.88 --> 893.459
overcome

889.68 --> 896.88
the natural entropy of heat dispersal

893.459 --> 899.459
it's too much heat energy being inserted

896.88 --> 902.579
into the system

899.459 --> 905.6389999999999
it cannot the entropy is not gonna Avail

902.579 --> 908.959
the water from building up enough heat

905.639 --> 908.9590000000001
to then start boiling

913.44 --> 918.62
okay more the top drones what are you

916.26 --> 918.62
talking about

923.279 --> 932.54
yeah you get the [ __ ] out of here

928.199 --> 932.54
Brenda pies are not welcome here

957.6 --> 961.0790000000001
I don't understand why don't you

959.82 --> 964.1990000000001
understand

961.079 --> 966.7199999999999
I literally just explained it to you do

964.199 --> 968.88
perfumes I literally like spent five

966.72 --> 972.6
minutes explaining

968.88 --> 974.279
every detail that concerns the question

972.6 --> 977.4200000000001
you asked

974.279 --> 977.42
four minutes ago

978.24 --> 981.72
what the [ __ ] you mean you don't

979.86 --> 984.779
understand that was like the most

981.72 --> 986.82
elaborate simple explanation that was a

984.779 --> 988.74
direct answer to your question that I

986.82 --> 991.5
could ever have given

988.74 --> 993.36
are you dim

991.5 --> 996.38
how the [ __ ] are you not understanding

993.36 --> 996.38
what I just explained

997.199 --> 1002.18
so much buffering for you okay our Aaron

999.72 --> 1003.86
Armstrong sorry about that but not on

1002.18 --> 1006.0999999999999
this side that's probably your

1003.86 --> 1006.1
connection

1006.8 --> 1010.3
this YouTube crap is broken

1011.12 --> 1015.82
yeah I don't know what the hell is going

1012.86 --> 1015.82
on it's weird

1023.66 --> 1027.22
at least the chat is working

1034.579 --> 1042.98
right anyway I'm probably gonna poop no

1039.679 --> 1045.22
and [ __ ] boy now duper punch is just

1042.98 --> 1045.22
thick

1046.819 --> 1051.08
everybody always thinks he's trolling I

1048.98 --> 1052.58
don't think so I just I do propose just

1051.08 --> 1054.62
thick

1052.58 --> 1056.78
I think he's a very young person and

1054.62 --> 1059.9799999999998
he's kind of dumb

1056.78 --> 1059.98
it just keeps trying

1066.5 --> 1069.88
to see you in Vegas

1070.94 --> 1075.76
yeah no I'm not gonna go to Vegas sorry

1076.76 --> 1081.559
right

1078.08 --> 1083.8999999999999
anyway I before I start eventually

1081.559 --> 1087.98
rounding out the show

1083.9 --> 1089.9
it's very short second parter

1087.98 --> 1090.799
all right okay Aaron Armstrong see you

1089.9 --> 1093.6200000000001
later

1090.799 --> 1095.299
I'd really like to ask again please

1093.62 --> 1097.6399999999999
support me

1095.299 --> 1099.98
please support what I do on my channel

1097.64 --> 1102.16
I'm really desperate for support right

1099.98 --> 1102.16
now

1106.46 --> 1112.94
some this week or it's gonna be hungry

1109.52 --> 1116.299
time like I don't have

1112.94 --> 1118.7
I'm recycling old tobacco right now

1116.299 --> 1119.96
that's where I'm at

1118.7 --> 1122.48
and

1119.96 --> 1124.1000000000001
after tomorrow I'm not gonna have any

1122.48 --> 1128.919
food

1124.1 --> 1128.9189999999999
of any sort no Illuminati casa

1129.799 --> 1133.7
no more dinner

1131.539 --> 1139.179
no more bread

1133.7 --> 1139.179
and eggs literally completely nothing

1140.419 --> 1146.0590000000002
so I'd really appreciate some financial

1144.26 --> 1151.179
support

1146.059 --> 1151.1789999999999
to help avoid that I starve

1156.5 --> 1163.24
take works as long as yeah and yeah boy

1160.7 --> 1163.24
yes

1164.36 --> 1169.4599999999998
ever consider stocking up in beans and

1166.82 --> 1171.86
rice yeah yeah well I did that a while

1169.46 --> 1174.7
ago and then I ate it

1171.86 --> 1174.6999999999998
Amy s

1182.36 --> 1188.12
it was really nice I was very glad that

1185.419 --> 1189.44
I stocked that up but yeah I did eat it

1188.12 --> 1193.3999999999999
so

1189.44 --> 1196.22
uh there is no more supplies

1193.4 --> 1199.3400000000001
it's cheap and filling yeah

1196.22 --> 1203.299
but it doesn't it just like I don't need

1199.34 --> 1206.539
filler right I don't need filling

1203.299 --> 1210.3799999999999
I need nutrition

1206.539 --> 1213.62
my tactic has always been I'll eat less

1210.38 --> 1216.14
as long as I can eat some

1213.62 --> 1219.32
that is very nutritious

1216.14 --> 1221.0590000000002
I'll settle with less food if it's at

1219.32 --> 1223.52
least nutritious

1221.059 --> 1225.74
I don't need filler stuff

1223.52 --> 1228.08
I mean if I'd wanted filler stuff I

1225.74 --> 1231.5
could get really cheap as non-organic

1228.08 --> 1234.5
rice and fill me up all day long but I

1231.5 --> 1236.78
will get sick eventually because of

1234.5 --> 1239.179
whatever is in there that I don't even

1236.78 --> 1242.0
know is in there

1239.179 --> 1244.66
pesticide wise or whatever

1242.0 --> 1244.66
so

1247.82 --> 1254.4399999999998
I just need some support so I can buy

1250.52 --> 1254.44
food get through this coming week

1254.48 --> 1260.679
you send me 20 euros ah thank you dank

1257.24 --> 1260.679
thank you so much

1266.66 --> 1272.1200000000001
yeah that will help me definitely

1270.2 --> 1275.0800000000002
thank you so much man I really

1272.12 --> 1275.08
appreciate that

1279.2 --> 1283.22
right

1281.12 --> 1285.58
yeah that'll get me through uh another

1283.22 --> 1285.58
day

1288.14 --> 1294.6200000000001
one time best way to support you

1291.14 --> 1296.0590000000002
a one-time basis

1294.62 --> 1298.8799999999999
uh

1296.059 --> 1302.0
well look you can do regular support

1298.88 --> 1303.679
through patreon if you want to there's

1302.0 --> 1305.6
not a lot of people that sign up with

1303.679 --> 1306.5590000000002
patreon with me but I mean it is an

1305.6 --> 1309.6789999999999
option

1306.559 --> 1313.039
but yeah PayPal is the most direct for

1309.679 --> 1315.5590000000002
me you see PayPal arrives it's literally

1313.039 --> 1319.12
in my bank account pretty quickly

1315.559 --> 1321.74
like usually within a day or two

1319.12 --> 1324.1399999999999
bypassing weekends it skips Sunday so

1321.74 --> 1326.299
that takes an extra day so

1324.14 --> 1328.5200000000002
that's just the quickest way to help me

1326.299 --> 1330.98
out because like yeah I'm running out of

1328.52 --> 1332.6589999999999
food right now then oh I'll sign up on

1330.98 --> 1334.7
your patreon well that's really awesome

1332.659 --> 1338.48
but that means I'm gonna be getting

1334.7 --> 1342.0800000000002
money in like three weeks so on the

1338.48 --> 1344.9
short run that's not super useful to me

1342.08 --> 1347.299
but if somebody just like passively

1344.9 --> 1350.0590000000002
supports me through patreon continually

1347.299 --> 1353.4189999999999
that like that's always helpful

1350.059 --> 1355.7
but I end up mostly using PayPal and I'm

1353.419 --> 1358.7
very thankful that I'm still allowed to

1355.7 --> 1362.98
use that despite my pretty extreme

1358.7 --> 1362.98
opinions that I share here on YouTube

1363.799 --> 1369.7
and thanks to PayPal I have been able to

1366.38 --> 1369.7
kind of survive all this

1369.74 --> 1373.539
these crazy times including

1376.0 --> 1381.7
yes and yeah boy it is in the

1379.039 --> 1381.7
description box

1385.88 --> 1391.22
right it's right there I'll give you a

1388.94 --> 1393.8600000000001
link you can click the description box

1391.22 --> 1396.4
or you can click this and no not that

1393.86 --> 1396.3999999999999
God damn it

1397.58 --> 1401.84
damn it

1398.559 --> 1405.1399999999999
why doesn't that happen

1401.84 --> 1408.86
that's a weird yeah no I don't need a

1405.14 --> 1412.8200000000002
freaking YouTube link you idiot

1408.86 --> 1414.9799999999998
I want the text not the entire [ __ ]

1412.82 --> 1416.6589999999999
video sub link

1414.98 --> 1419.0
terrible

1416.659 --> 1421.2800000000002
oh yeah dank thank you

1419.0 --> 1425.12
keeps like spamming this giant block of

1421.28 --> 1427.8799999999999
text like copy no I don't need the

1425.12 --> 1429.4599999999998
entire web page with a highlighted

1427.88 --> 1432.8200000000002
little piece of text within it

1429.46 --> 1432.82
ridiculous YouTube

1433.22 --> 1440.299
whatever thank you thanks for doing that

1437.84 --> 1444.3999999999999
so yeah that is the link any support any

1440.299 --> 1444.4
more support will be greatly appreciated

1445.4 --> 1449.9
still unable to access the Bitcoin

1447.5 --> 1452.0
thingy you're taking it it's not a

1449.9 --> 1455.6000000000001
Bitcoin thingy but

1452.0 --> 1460.539
uh no I haven't gotten any

1455.6 --> 1460.539
uh you uh what is it usdt

1461.059 --> 1466.58
no yeah nobody actually went through

1463.94 --> 1470.0
that I mean I could still use that I

1466.58 --> 1471.32
mean you want to give me tether usdt

1470.0 --> 1474.2
from Tron

1471.32 --> 1476.299
that would be super helpful

1474.2 --> 1479.799
if I could get like a hundred bucks of

1476.299 --> 1479.799
it or something like that

1480.02 --> 1485.48
but yeah I'll give you a wallet address

1482.419 --> 1488.1200000000001
if you like email me about that

1485.48 --> 1492.64
so somebody can give it to me but nobody

1488.12 --> 1492.6399999999999
has and nobody seems to really care

1492.679 --> 1495.52
so yeah

1495.559 --> 1501.98
stuff is still working out great it is

1498.559 --> 1504.3799999999999
it is growing it is growing like a nerve

1501.98 --> 1506.539
plant in Spring

1504.38 --> 1508.7
it's getting big

1506.539 --> 1510.559
like it's growing itself now I don't

1508.7 --> 1513.88
even have to do anything anymore and

1510.559 --> 1513.8799999999999
still growing it's crazy

1515.12 --> 1520.76
so yeah

1516.94 --> 1522.799
eventually one day I might actually make

1520.76 --> 1526.1589999999999
a living out of that

1522.799 --> 1528.2
but I have to open the gates and right

1526.159 --> 1531.7990000000002
now the only way to do that is very

1528.2 --> 1535.76
slowly is through usdt and I don't have

1531.799 --> 1538.1
that and I don't have money to buy it

1535.76 --> 1541.94
I need my money for

1538.1 --> 1544.279
food so I can eat tomorrow so I don't

1541.94 --> 1546.8600000000001
have a hundred bucks left over for that

1544.279 --> 1551.44
sort of thing even though I would

1546.86 --> 1551.4399999999998
really benefit from it on the long run

1552.02 --> 1557.36
right

1554.0 --> 1559.52
so if anybody wants to reconsider and

1557.36 --> 1563.4399999999998
send me usdt

1559.52 --> 1563.44
then let me know by email

1570.14 --> 1576.98
you canceled your globalist paper yeah

1573.86 --> 1579.9399999999998
okay well they're great gifts and go

1576.98 --> 1579.94
campaign nope

1584.779 --> 1588.5
I don't see the difference

1586.88 --> 1591.2
by the way

1588.5 --> 1594.32
it's all the same stuff

1591.2 --> 1596.8400000000001
and PayPal works like PayPal is one of

1594.32 --> 1598.82
the few things that actually works

1596.84 --> 1600.74
like internationally

1598.82 --> 1604.0
I mean all these

1600.74 --> 1606.38
my funding systems are mostly

1604.0 --> 1610.48
inter-american they're all inside of

1606.38 --> 1610.48
America yeah that doesn't work with me

1613.76 --> 1621.14
didn't you have those cards

1617.0 --> 1623.0
oh don't know if they were no

1621.14 --> 1624.38
and besides

1623.0 --> 1627.08
it's none of your [ __ ] business

1624.38 --> 1630.98

if that's what you want

1655.6 --> 1662.84
if you want me to go and do other things

1659.24 --> 1665.84

1662.84 --> 1669.6789999999999

1809.299 --> 1815.779
years people have literally told me that

trolls mostly just like oh you got this

1815.779 --> 1820.1
right you sell that like they don't give

anything

1821.0 --> 1825.5
people have told me that oh why'd you

1823.1 --> 1827.899
just sell your golden ring then oh yeah

1825.5 --> 1829.76
because it's [ __ ] magical and this is

1827.899 --> 1832.34
literally the first golden ring I've

1829.76 --> 1834.3799999999999
ever made and it's my own personal

1832.34 --> 1836.84
religious symbol

1834.38 --> 1840.46

1842.899 --> 1848.36
not gonna [ __ ] sell

1844.52 --> 1849.9189999999999
because it has really heavy value on on

1848.36 --> 1852.5
it for me

1849.919 --> 1854.72
for practical purposes it's like things

1852.5 --> 1855.98
I do things with things I want to do

1854.72 --> 1858.74
things with

1855.98 --> 1860.539
I'm currently in a position where you

1858.74 --> 1861.799
could almost think of me as being in

1860.539 --> 1863.899
prison

1861.799 --> 1865.34
financially I'm like in a financial

1863.899 --> 1868.279
prison

1865.34 --> 1872.0
but I'm not gonna get out of that prison

1868.279 --> 1874.58
by selling everything I own that's not

1872.0 --> 1877.34
going to get me out of the financial

1874.58 --> 1880.48
prison it will just make me lose

1877.34 --> 1880.48
everything I got

1886.779 --> 1891.26
bugs are free

1889.22 --> 1893.72
yeah that's hilarious I get lots of bugs

1891.26 --> 1895.8799999999999
dude if I would eat bugs I wouldn't need

1893.72 --> 1897.26
anything because there's bugs flying in

1895.88 --> 1900.8200000000002
here all the time

1897.26 --> 1900.82
but I'm not gonna eat bugs

1902.419 --> 1908.539
because that's really unhealthy for me

1906.32 --> 1911.6589999999999
right and there's literally crickets

1908.539 --> 1914.299
walking in here I could literally pick a

1911.659 --> 1917.2990000000002
cricket off the wall and eat it if I if

1914.299 --> 1920.1399999999999
I'd be able to do such a thing yeah

1917.299 --> 1920.1399999999999
no thanks

1921.58 --> 1926.12
I get crickets walking all over me

1924.2 --> 1929.48
yesterday there's like this

1926.12 --> 1932.7199999999998
those eight-legged monster things

1929.48 --> 1935.1200000000001
those weird long legged not spider

1932.72 --> 1937.3990000000001
creatures that have their eyes on their

1935.12 --> 1939.799
feet really weird very glad they're that

1937.399 --> 1941.0
small but that those creatures were like

1939.799 --> 1943.6399999999999
walking around they were literally

1941.0 --> 1945.14
walking over my head I'm like what the

1943.64 --> 1947.8990000000001
[ __ ] I'm standing in the middle of the

1945.14 --> 1949.46
room how the hell did you get to the

1947.899 --> 1951.08
point where you're now walking on my

1949.46 --> 1954.559
heads

1951.08 --> 1957.74
weird ass creatures and I mean them no

1954.559 --> 1960.08
harm they are like robots

1957.74 --> 1962.8990000000001
but yeah when you don't expect them you

1960.08 --> 1965.059
they can start all the [ __ ] yes

1962.899 --> 1966.7399999999998
and they're probably on average not very

1965.059 --> 1969.58
popular with the ladies because they

1966.74 --> 1969.58
look so creepy

1970.64 --> 1974.44
but yeah bugs are plenty

1975.679 --> 1982.0590000000002
so right indeed if you support me then I

1978.86 --> 1984.559
will go and continue on do my best

1982.059 --> 1986.96
explain things that are on average

1984.559 --> 1990.3799999999999
complicated get misunderstandings out of

1986.96 --> 1992.8990000000001
the way help you identify illusions

1990.38 --> 1993.7990000000002
within your own train of thinking that I

1992.899 --> 1996.559
don't

1993.799 --> 1998.0
I don't take it as nefarious when people

1996.559 --> 1999.799
make mistakes

1998.0 --> 2001.84
I understand where the mistakes come

1999.799 --> 2004.779
from and I understand how so many

2001.84 --> 2006.279
sources that you because you don't know

2004.779 --> 2008.5
any other source

2006.279 --> 2010.059
that's what you take and it's polluted

2008.5 --> 2011.38
and you don't know the pollution you

2010.059 --> 2012.34
don't recognize it you think that's

2011.38 --> 2015.8200000000002
normal

2012.34 --> 2018.9399999999998
but I can tell you why it is pollution

2015.82 --> 2021.6399999999999
how it is pollution and then

2018.94 --> 2024.3600000000001
I'll teach you how to pick better

2021.64 --> 2024.3600000000001
sources

2024.64 --> 2028.72
