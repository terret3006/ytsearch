right anyway

117.72 --> 124.579
weather today is better

121.14 --> 128.7
there were still some Trails but

124.579 --> 132.239
it's still mostly a blue sky I think

128.7 --> 135.78
just a bit hazy because of that but

132.239 --> 139.56
still nice bright Sun

135.78 --> 142.879
only very little wind

139.56 --> 142.879
nice day overall

144.599 --> 148.28
it's a very cold night though

150.3 --> 154.62
but uh yeah

152.34 --> 158.52
there was Frost this night but it's all

154.62 --> 160.37900000000002
melted away already it seems

158.52 --> 161.76000000000002
might be a little warmer even than I

160.379 --> 164.29999999999998
think

161.76 --> 164.29999999999998
anyway

164.76 --> 169.39999999999998
hello psych bear first to chat good to

167.04 --> 169.4
see you man

169.98 --> 177.599
it is

172.019 --> 177.59900000000002
Friday the 10th of February 2023

181.019 --> 185.48000000000002
and yeah yesterday it was a bit of a

183.06 --> 185.48
weird day

187.019 --> 193.019
ah

189.319 --> 196.319
flatter the date discontinued Nathan was

193.019 --> 198.36
like exhausted apparent like I didn't he

196.319 --> 200.659
said he started an hour later

198.36 --> 203.22000000000003
even put that in the chat

200.659 --> 205.44
yeah when it was already around when the

203.22 --> 207.8
show had already rounded out

205.44 --> 210.72
but then attorney didn't show up at all

207.8 --> 214.08
because she was exhausted apparently has

210.72 --> 216.239
some stuff he's fixing again and it took

214.08 --> 219.0
him all night and all that hopefully

216.239 --> 222.019
there will be a live show today

219.0 --> 222.019
not sure yet

222.659 --> 225.84
but

223.98 --> 227.04
yeah there was no flat Earth debate

225.84 --> 229.08
yesterday

227.04 --> 231.48
the premiere though

229.08 --> 234.12
I mean that's just fine

231.48 --> 237.92
uh

234.12 --> 237.92000000000002
right then later

243.92 --> 250.04
Jim Bob and flat sword went live

250.739 --> 256.44
and also a weird Quantum of conscious

253.319 --> 259.139
video again like oh that was a weird one

256.44 --> 262.44
but yeah man that was

259.139 --> 266.04
was kind of odd I went to Jim Bob's and

262.44 --> 269.04
I basically well and that's my fault I

266.04 --> 271.139
guess continued hammering

269.04 --> 273.24
the points

271.139 --> 275.72
from the debate with him and Owen

273.24 --> 275.72
Benjamin

275.82 --> 281.46
because

277.44 --> 284.1
yeah he was literally saying well

281.46 --> 286.02
literally trying to gloat how he had won

284.1 --> 287.72
the debate and I was just like I'm not

286.02 --> 291.12
taking this at all

287.72 --> 293.88000000000005
so I called him out in the chat and then

291.12 --> 295.62
he threatened to ban me

293.88 --> 298.08
because I said

295.62 --> 299.82
he didn't answer a question for half an

298.08 --> 301.38
hour straight when it was just a basic

299.82 --> 304.8
question

301.38 --> 308.36
it got really frustrated from that so

304.8 --> 308.36
yeah I am kind of

309.6 --> 316.02000000000004
I'm a bit over over uh

312.78 --> 317.82
Jim Bob I'm like this is like highly

316.02 --> 322.44
disappointing to me not that he

317.82 --> 324.65999999999997
threatened to ban me but that is just

322.44 --> 327.02
well I think that his position is very

324.66 --> 327.02000000000004
weak

327.419 --> 332.52
and

328.8 --> 334.86
because yeah he trusts in men not in God

332.52 --> 337.74
not in the truth

334.86 --> 341.759
not in logic

337.74 --> 344.82
he chooses men over logic and that is in

341.759 --> 347.37
my philosophical position absolutely

344.82 --> 350.62
intolerable

347.37 --> 350.62
[Music]

352.62 --> 356.9
anyway hello tiger bear it's you

357.24 --> 363.199
disappointed Jimbo yeah psych bear I

360.12 --> 363.199
think more people were

366.12 --> 371.039
right because

367.979 --> 373.68
well the time before that I went up

371.039 --> 376.38
against him that hour remember

373.68 --> 378.72
and he basically tried to technobabble

376.38 --> 381.12
me as well

378.72 --> 383.52000000000004
getting into philosophical mathematics

381.12 --> 385.02
and straw Manning me with that in that

383.52 --> 387.479
particular argument what if he's gonna

385.02 --> 391.38
do with that when I was basically not

387.479 --> 393.539
even defending a position that much I

391.38 --> 394.86
was just trying to highlight like no I

393.539 --> 397.259
think you're strong Manning it because

394.86 --> 399.41900000000004
these people that you highlight are

397.259 --> 402.84000000000003
supposedly being that

399.419 --> 404.4
they're just Nutters attention grabbing

402.84 --> 407.90999999999997
others they're like

404.4 --> 409.44
there's nothing to do with pagan

407.91 --> 413.16
[Music]

409.44 --> 415.62
real pagans like do not listen to those

413.16 --> 417.90000000000003
guys guaranteed

415.62 --> 420.18
uh but yeah there's just no point for me

417.9 --> 423.419
to go in a debate with him about pretty

420.18 --> 426.3
much anything unless we already know to

423.419 --> 428.15999999999997
agree because he is just going to attack

426.3 --> 430.139
no babble

428.16 --> 432.53900000000004
his way through

430.139 --> 436.02
although yeah it might have some backing

432.539 --> 438.18
but backing that is basically already a

436.02 --> 440.15999999999997
straw man approach to what I'm gonna

438.18 --> 442.259
do the actual conversation he's done

440.16 --> 446.40000000000003
that that one time he did it with Big

442.259 --> 450.68
Bear and I'm just kind of like

446.4 --> 450.67999999999995
this is lame this is just lame

450.9 --> 456.02
I mean I love him doing the voices and

453.3 --> 458.759
all with the Deep fake faces that's cute

456.02 --> 461.34
but as some people pointed out yeah he's

458.759 --> 463.62
getting kind of Jordan Peterson about it

461.34 --> 465.85999999999996
and that is

463.62 --> 471.08
well

465.86 --> 471.08000000000004
it it crosses the border of hypocrisy

471.84 --> 477.599
so

474.06 --> 478.86
and I don't see it fixing itself anytime

477.599 --> 480.96
soon

478.86 --> 483.96000000000004
I could actually see like a look of

480.96 --> 487.19899999999996
grief on Jim Bob from spiritual metadata

483.96 --> 491.63899999999995
there so he's in a serious conflict I

487.199 --> 493.68
think but yeah he's he's gonna choose

491.639 --> 495.36
he's gonna have to choose and I think

493.68 --> 498.44
he's choosing

495.36 --> 498.44
the doctrine

498.9 --> 503.37
because he wants to be part of that

500.58 --> 506.43
church really badly I guess

503.37 --> 506.43
[Music]

506.759 --> 512.219
right anyway hello jedo

509.42 --> 516.419
[Music]

512.219 --> 519.36
that happened and then like I left I was

516.419 --> 522.02
was like okay let's just go over to Flat

519.36 --> 525.5
swords and it was also streaming live

522.02 --> 525.5
and there this

525.68 --> 531.5999999999999
insane woman

528.24 --> 532.92
it was been added for like like over a

531.6 --> 535.019
week at least

532.92 --> 536.66
had been like

535.019 --> 538.38
just

536.66 --> 542.04
slandering

538.38 --> 545.1
and like ad homing and

542.04 --> 548.519
like spreading really vile rumors just

545.1 --> 551.58
in the chat in flat switch chat

548.519 --> 555.3
and she even had to go

551.58 --> 558.72
to to literally call me like to address

555.3 --> 560.88
me in a racist way or rather gossiping

558.72 --> 562.14
about me in a racist way like calling me

560.88 --> 564.36
a peanut

562.14 --> 566.519
which yeah you never heard of that well

564.36 --> 569.339
she's Dutch guess what and in Dutch yeah

566.519 --> 572.88
we very much know what that means and

569.339 --> 576.48
that is like real overt racism

572.88 --> 579.779
not that I oh raise it up it's just like

576.48 --> 582.9590000000001
what the [ __ ] man like why why the hell

579.779 --> 585.12
would you even do that that is so low so

582.959 --> 588.68
I try to address flat side at it and he

585.12 --> 592.08
just ignored it he ignored it completely

588.68 --> 595.3199999999999
and he kept ignoring it and even made

592.08 --> 597.899
excu he said in Skype because I

595.32 --> 600.72
addressed him in Skype and he said I

597.899 --> 603.18
don't want to get involved in politics

600.72 --> 605.399
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

603.18 --> 609.12
flat sword you cuck

605.399 --> 611.339
you sick [ __ ] what the [ __ ] does

609.12 --> 614.279
somebody slandering and cyber stalking

611.339 --> 619.019
me and being racist about me spreading

614.279 --> 622.8
false rumors what about that is politics

619.019 --> 625.44
you gave this wench a wrench

622.8 --> 629.399
and she is insane

625.44 --> 632.22
and vile like overtly vile and

629.399 --> 634.5
slanderous you're irresponsible giving

632.22 --> 636.1800000000001
her that wrench you should take that

634.5 --> 638.519
wrench I don't even know why you want

636.18 --> 640.76
that stupid [ __ ] hanging around when

638.519 --> 645.18
she's just a loud mouth

640.76 --> 649.1
and just slandering hysterically

645.18 --> 649.0999999999999
why the hell do you even want her around

649.74 --> 655.1
over me like a known flat earther that

652.68 --> 655.0999999999999
you know

655.62 --> 661.14
like we know each other I

658.92 --> 662.88
been and on the scene even before you

661.14 --> 664.8
came on

662.88 --> 666.66
we talked plenty

664.8 --> 670.74
we've been on Flat Earth debates

666.66 --> 673.68
together like why are you doing that

670.74 --> 676.74
it feels like a kind of a backstab in a

673.68 --> 678.4799999999999
way on a personal level so that happened

676.74 --> 679.32
as well

678.48 --> 683.519
foreign

679.32 --> 686.4200000000001
and I'm like okay wow

683.519 --> 686.42
what a day

688.61 --> 694.0790000000001
[Music]

690.899 --> 696.54
yeah sorry there

694.079 --> 698.519
perhaps but the thing is look I give

696.54 --> 701.2199999999999
wrenches to people and then people in

698.519 --> 702.36
chat start to slowly go full Savage and

701.22 --> 706.2
nutty

702.36 --> 708.839
and guess what I take the wrenches away

706.2 --> 710.279
I don't say to other people that are

708.839 --> 714.4200000000001
complaining

710.279 --> 716.88
uh I'm not getting involved in politics

714.42 --> 719.519
like what the [ __ ] man

716.88 --> 722.82
what that did you think you think that's

719.519 --> 724.74
gonna work it's a direct insult to my

722.82 --> 727.279
intelligence to say something like that

724.74 --> 727.279
flat side

728.459 --> 732.2399999999999
and I'm highly highly disappointed in

731.16 --> 734.64
you

732.24 --> 737.24
apparently you're not such a strong

734.64 --> 737.24
character

738.899 --> 745.88
can't control your own chat

742.14 --> 749.88
you make up excuses for people that are

745.88 --> 749.88
egregiously misbehaving

750.74 --> 758.029
[Music]

759.42 --> 763.86
you watched early bird 82 cool good for

762.6 --> 766.5600000000001
you man

763.86 --> 769.5600000000001
yeah those that was really intense

766.56 --> 772.68
I was in a really bad spot during 82

769.56 --> 777.3599999999999
I had just basically watched

772.68 --> 780.3
some reports about really dire

777.36 --> 781.98
child torture [ __ ] and all that and I

780.3 --> 784.26
shouldn't have watched it and I went

781.98 --> 786.54
completely ballistic because of it yeah

784.26 --> 787.98
that's what happened at 82.

786.54 --> 790.68
because

787.98 --> 792.72
that's

790.68 --> 794.9399999999999
just yeah

792.72 --> 797.519
that's how I respond to those types of

794.94 --> 800.339
things I get kind of fanatic

797.519 --> 801.839
I go berserk

800.339 --> 805.74
right

801.839 --> 807.899
have not gone berserk like that since

805.74 --> 810.42
not to that level anyway

807.899 --> 814.579
because I really let let everything go

810.42 --> 814.579
let all the restraints off all of it

815.7 --> 820.26
or most of it not all of it I didn't

817.68 --> 823.019
just go full crazy demonic because

820.26 --> 825.779
there's absolutely no point to that that

823.019 --> 827.399
defeats the entire purpose of the anger

825.779 --> 829.88
itself

827.399 --> 829.88
anyway

836.579 --> 841.26
ah

838.399 --> 842.459
defeat trolls with silence yeah that's

841.26 --> 844.98
cute

842.459 --> 847.92
that's very cute defeat trolls except

844.98 --> 850.139
that she's been doing that for weeks and

847.92 --> 851.639
literally like I banned her at first and

850.139 --> 854.4590000000001
like blocked her

851.639 --> 857.279
guess what she does the same [ __ ] like

854.459 --> 860.459
that piece of scumbag [ __ ] needs to

857.279 --> 862.5
kill himself Bobby Steele who also hangs

860.459 --> 866.6999999999999
around and still

862.5 --> 869.339
like breaks in good moments to just to

866.7 --> 870.6600000000001
just troll me he's a [ __ ] bastard who

869.339 --> 874.74
needs to die

870.66 --> 878.6999999999999
mean it that guy needs to die

874.74 --> 881.82
he is a unlimited scumbag

878.7 --> 884.5790000000001
right well she is almost acting like

881.82 --> 888.5400000000001
that because I had her blocked and she

884.579 --> 890.88
would literally start slandering me to

888.54 --> 893.3389999999999
other people and

890.88 --> 896.04
literally

893.339 --> 898.2600000000001
so that I could literally see she was

896.04 --> 901.62
there gossiping about me because other

898.26 --> 904.8
people would address her yeah listen you

901.62 --> 907.68
can't get away from that

904.8 --> 911.459
you can't just block it I'll still see

907.68 --> 913.079
people are obviously gossiping with her

911.459 --> 917.2399999999999
about me

913.079 --> 917.2399999999999
I'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ]

919.38 --> 923.579
yeah trolls defeating trolls with

921.839 --> 926.339
silence works great when everybody

923.579 --> 929.16
realizes like hey she's a slandering

926.339 --> 931.5
[ __ ] we shouldn't talk to her when

929.16 --> 934.5
she's talking like that but guess what

931.5 --> 937.16
they do they don't do that they just

934.5 --> 942.24
talk to them and flat side is just

937.16 --> 944.48
A-Okay with that for over a week

942.24 --> 944.48
foreign

945.43 --> 948.64
[Music]

951.32 --> 956.339
for me visiting your show then you want

954.6 --> 957.9590000000001
don't want me to visit your show anymore

956.339 --> 960.1
flat side

957.959 --> 963.2199999999999
you don't like my input

960.1 --> 963.22
[Music]

963.72 --> 967.6990000000001
you don't want my Association there

968.16 --> 973.68
because if you're gonna keep that hag

971.04 --> 977.18
around in there

973.68 --> 977.18
[ __ ] the place up

977.639 --> 983.04
I'm not gonna be part of your show

980.88 --> 984.72
anymore

983.04 --> 986.2199999999999
and I would have loved to I would have

984.72 --> 990.6
loved to come on the panel more

986.22 --> 993.6
regularly right all that give my input

990.6 --> 997.38
give my insights I love doing that you

993.6 --> 1000.9200000000001
see but not if you leave slanderous hags

997.38 --> 1002.48
continually gossiping about me

1000.92 --> 1004.66
in the chat

1002.48 --> 1006.259
you understand flatzoid

1004.66 --> 1008.68
[Music]

1006.259 --> 1008.6800000000001
people

1011.3 --> 1013.3
um

1017.199 --> 1024.1399999999999
anyway so yeah I had a pretty weird

1020.66 --> 1026.24
rough afternoon because all that [ __ ] oh

1024.14 --> 1030.3390000000002
one after another

1026.24 --> 1030.339
and it's like what the [ __ ] is this crap

1030.439 --> 1036.74
it's all this negative there was a lot

1033.38 --> 1039.5790000000002
of negativity around it overall

1036.74 --> 1039.579
weird

1041.299 --> 1047.179
and I can't say that I was like

1044.839 --> 1050.4189999999999
part of the cause of that in a direct

1047.179 --> 1054.3400000000001
sense because I mean my show was pretty

1050.419 --> 1054.3400000000001
was fine was not negative

1054.86 --> 1061.82
oh and by the way

1057.5 --> 1064.34
remember how I said like oh

1061.82 --> 1066.46
the theest transhumanism

1064.34 --> 1069.32
video was designated

1066.46 --> 1072.46
Arwin Flat Earth early bird Flat Earth

1069.32 --> 1075.98
well guess what it's been redesignated

1072.46 --> 1079.22
it's been redesignated

1075.98 --> 1081.38
to guess what hashtag tartaria Black

1079.22 --> 1084.8600000000001
Swan Freemasons

1081.38 --> 1087.0800000000002
so apparently all my videos are hashtag

1084.86 --> 1089.6
tartaria hashtag Black Swan hashtag

1087.08 --> 1092.48
Freemasons now I've checked I've checked

1089.6 --> 1096.1
back to like shows from a year ago

1092.48 --> 1096.1
and they were designated that

1099.98 --> 1106.1200000000001
but now now that I'm streaming this

1103.52 --> 1106.12
video

1106.58 --> 1112.46
it's hashtag Arwin hashtag flutterlybird

1110.66 --> 1115.1200000000001
hashtag Flat Earth

1112.46 --> 1118.72
but I'll bet you

1115.12 --> 1122.8999999999999
that in two days this stream

1118.72 --> 1123.919
1508 trust God not man is going to be

1122.9 --> 1126.14
named

1123.919 --> 1128.7990000000002
guess what

1126.14 --> 1131.8400000000001
you know what

1128.799 --> 1134.9
#territory hashtag loves one hashtag

1131.84 --> 1139.539
Freemasons because that is apparently

1134.9 --> 1139.539
what I am according to YouTube

1140.96 --> 1144.52
really weird

1147.44 --> 1150.3400000000001
foreign

1156.14 --> 1162.44
yes you see like just look at the this

1159.62 --> 1164.12
live stream video right

1162.44 --> 1166.52
first you have the block of the video

1164.12 --> 1168.1999999999998
then underneath that you have the title

1166.52 --> 1170.4189999999999
of the video then underneath that you

1168.2 --> 1172.5800000000002
have like the channel and it's kind of

1170.419 --> 1175.039
cramped with the join button and maybe

1172.58 --> 1176.539
you have an analytics and edit videos

1175.039 --> 1180.74
just for me

1176.539 --> 1183.62
the up file thumbs up thumbs down share

1180.74 --> 1187.039
clip all that and then you have the

1183.62 --> 1189.62
block of the description text

1187.039 --> 1193.94
which is usually like

1189.62 --> 1197.539
three sentences but on top of that in

1193.94 --> 1199.16
Black in Darker in bold text it's the

1197.539 --> 1200.48
amount of watching and when it's

1199.16 --> 1202.8200000000002
streamed right and this thing is

1200.48 --> 1207.14
updating but guess what right next to

1202.82 --> 1211.0
that in a little bit grayer letters

1207.14 --> 1211.0
are hashtag designations

1213.44 --> 1220.039
and YouTube chooses those designations

1218.9 --> 1222.98
because

1220.039 --> 1225.62
if you say show more on the description

1222.98 --> 1227.539
yeah you'll see underneath

1225.62 --> 1231.1399999999999
uh

1227.539 --> 1232.7
highlighted as links in blue for me is

1231.14 --> 1235.039
all kinds of hashtags right starting

1232.7 --> 1236.72
with hashtag Arwin early bird Flat Earth

1235.039 --> 1238.72
debate Flat Earth shape of the earth

1236.72 --> 1242.24
back swan mifa

1238.72 --> 1244.64
cosmogenist Atlantis

1242.24 --> 1247.64
Etc this whole gigantic list

1244.64 --> 1250.039
right but that list never changes or

1247.64 --> 1252.5
well unless I choose to change it in the

1250.039 --> 1254.6
description I I've sometimes removed

1252.5 --> 1256.28
something or add something but not a lot

1254.6 --> 1258.3799999999999
it's mostly the same

1256.28 --> 1259.52
for a long time

1258.38 --> 1263.8400000000001
but

1259.52 --> 1266.6
it seems like YouTube picks

1263.84 --> 1268.82
from the hashtags that you put in the

1266.6 --> 1269.7199999999998
description box This Is What It Seems

1268.82 --> 1273.28
like

1269.72 --> 1277.34
and then chooses per video

1273.28 --> 1279.26
what hashtags to put there right next to

1277.34 --> 1280.6399999999999
the how many watching and how long it's

1279.26 --> 1284.62
been streaming

1280.64 --> 1284.6200000000001
it chooses that not me

1286.4 --> 1291.2
I I can't even edit it I can't even

1288.62 --> 1295.1
correct it if it does that

1291.2 --> 1298.4
yeah so all my videos are hashtag

1295.1 --> 1301.1589999999999
Terraria hashtag Black Swan hashtag

1298.4 --> 1303.5
Freemason yes

1301.159 --> 1305.7990000000002
yes and there's nothing I can do about

1303.5 --> 1305.799
it

1306.02 --> 1312.32
it's probably not maybe if I completely

1309.32 --> 1315.2
get those hashtags out of the list

1312.32 --> 1317.12
that it wouldn't use them anymore

1315.2 --> 1319.46
but I don't want to take them out of the

1317.12 --> 1323.059
list because those are subjects that I

1319.46 --> 1323.059
do talk about occasionally

1324.5 --> 1330.559
so it's all just yeah I don't know I

1328.46 --> 1333.26
don't know it's weird

1330.559 --> 1335.78
I didn't ask for it I can't like turn it

1333.26 --> 1337.75
off or anything

1335.78 --> 1340.8999999999999
foreign

1337.75 --> 1343.36
[Music]

1340.9 --> 1347.2
by the way this is

1343.36 --> 1347.1999999999998
relatively a new thing

1347.299 --> 1351.86
I don't know exactly when it started

1350.539 --> 1354.74
but

1351.86 --> 1357.74
it's somewhere in the last year

1354.74 --> 1360.74
or a half year maybe even the last few

1357.74 --> 1363.32
months that that happened but it's all

1360.74 --> 1366.799
been done here retroactively

1363.32 --> 1370.12
all the videos have it now retroactively

1366.799 --> 1370.12
that it didn't used to

1370.82 --> 1378.289
anyway hello Earth is life space Miner

1375.23 --> 1378.289
[Music]

1379.4 --> 1383.89
ah

1380.52 --> 1383.8899999999999
[Music]

1390.74 --> 1393.28
right

1397.039 --> 1403.64
so yeah I've been kind of looking around

1400.22 --> 1407.74
a bit for a while and

1403.64 --> 1407.74
and now there's just disappointments

1409.88 --> 1418.5390000000002
I mean the Dahan Channel wasn't exactly

1414.14 --> 1418.539
a long run either for me

1424.34 --> 1427.6999999999998
I'm running out of channels that are

1426.26 --> 1431.6
interesting

1427.7 --> 1433.52
that's not entirely true not but I mean

1431.6 --> 1435.74
it's just

1433.52 --> 1438.26
I don't know maybe it'll all change

1435.74 --> 1442.64
around again maybe somebody's actually

1438.26 --> 1444.5
listening to my criticism wow it's you

1442.64 --> 1447.98
know people might be listening to my

1444.5 --> 1450.38
criticism it's not like they let me know

1447.98 --> 1452.96
or anything ever

1450.38 --> 1455.38
except maybe like at the Flat Earth

1452.96 --> 1455.38
debates

1456.919 --> 1459.3400000000001
but

1458.36 --> 1462.3799999999999
people

1459.34 --> 1465.76
apparently follow my show but I just

1462.38 --> 1469.1000000000001
rarely get any feedback from it

1465.76 --> 1471.74
very very rarely which makes me feel

1469.1 --> 1473.7199999999998
like nobody actually cares about what I

1471.74 --> 1476.78
say

1473.72 --> 1478.22
but for some reason I still do seem to

1476.78 --> 1480.1399999999999
have influence so it's all very

1478.22 --> 1481.82
confusing it's like oh so do you watch

1480.14 --> 1483.0200000000002
my stream or don't you watch my stream

1481.82 --> 1484.76
because

1483.02 --> 1486.4
it's like everybody's keeping it a

1484.76 --> 1491.799
secret that they're watching my stream

1486.4 --> 1491.799
or something from me it's weird

1492.5 --> 1497.14
it would be good if people would just

1494.72 --> 1497.14
actually

1498.02 --> 1504.679
gifts and recognition

1500.08 --> 1507.26
besides Nathan Oakley Nathan bro you bro

1504.679 --> 1511.159
you don't I know you do

1507.26 --> 1514.1589999999999
you've been very gracious thank you

1511.159 --> 1516.3200000000002
like in that aspect definitely I don't

1514.159 --> 1518.419
need Nathan to promote me any more than

1516.32 --> 1520.3999999999999
he already does that's perfect

1518.419 --> 1522.0800000000002
I'm very happy about that

1520.4 --> 1524.799
what I mean

1522.08 --> 1524.799
out there

1526.58 --> 1532.059
it would be good if to know that you're

1528.86 --> 1532.059
actually watching my show

1532.159 --> 1540.3400000000001
and hey maybe invite me sometime did

1536.779 --> 1543.02
argue right you're not gonna have a

1540.34 --> 1545.539
technobabble situation on your hands

1543.02 --> 1548.24
right I mean if I'm gonna address

1545.539 --> 1551.059
something or explain something and it's

1548.24 --> 1553.1
really complicated to you you don't have

1551.059 --> 1556.039
to be freaking ashamed you just get

1553.1 --> 1559.52
Socratic it just get Socratic because

1556.039 --> 1562.58
guess what everything that comes out of

1559.52 --> 1567.2
me is held by one standard and that is

1562.58 --> 1570.26
that it can be made explicable that I

1567.2 --> 1573.4
can explain I can't explain it all it

1570.26 --> 1573.4
will make sense

1573.799 --> 1579.679
I don't just

1576.86 --> 1582.1399999999999
make up [ __ ] and then portray like it's

1579.679 --> 1585.88
all that without it actually having a

1582.14 --> 1585.88
foundation I never do that

1586.52 --> 1592.4189999999999
if I'm gonna make something up I'll say

1589.159 --> 1592.419
I just made it up

1593.539 --> 1599.12
right if something is a presupposition

1596.0 --> 1603.02
then it's just a presuppositional trait

1599.12 --> 1604.82
of thinking it doesn't hold weight to me

1603.02 --> 1607.6589999999999
because it's just a presuppositional

1604.82 --> 1607.6589999999999
train of thinking

1610.64 --> 1616.64
does feel a little strange getting to

1612.679 --> 1618.2
know you while I'm just in the chat yeah

1616.64 --> 1620.9
I guess so

1618.2 --> 1624.76
I'm very open and direct aren't I

1620.9 --> 1624.76
and that is in a way unusual

1628.279 --> 1633.919
so a lot of people in media only do that

1630.679 --> 1636.14
on a rare occasion like in a special

1633.919 --> 1638.0590000000002
honest close to Heart moment or

1636.14 --> 1640.88
something and then they just go back to

1638.059 --> 1643.8799999999999
the standard procedures again after that

1640.88 --> 1648.7
well guess what being open and honest is

1643.88 --> 1648.7
my standard procedure ha ha

1655.15 --> 1658.3090000000002
[Music]

1659.48 --> 1663.279
huh what was that you do

1664.03 --> 1667.309
[Music]

1684.22 --> 1687.58
what's going on

1702.38 --> 1704.5590000000002
foreign

1708.1 --> 1711.279
that's weird

1714.08 --> 1720.32
why did you retract that message like

1717.38 --> 1722.0
if you're not gonna replace it I mean if

1720.32 --> 1725.99
it was a correction that's one thing I

1722.0 --> 1727.64
do that plenty but like what is this

1725.99 --> 1729.74
[Music]

1727.64 --> 1731.8400000000001
anyway uh

1729.74 --> 1733.46
all right so I had a bit of a weird day

1731.84 --> 1735.32
yesterday with all those situations

1733.46 --> 1737.8400000000001
actually called My Healer this morning

1735.32 --> 1740.059
and there was a whole bunch of stuff

1737.84 --> 1742.48
happening

1740.059 --> 1742.48
again

1743.539 --> 1748.46
but it did very much help and I feel a

1746.72 --> 1751.279
lot clearer because I really felt like

1748.46 --> 1752.9
oh they're all coming after me that's

1751.279 --> 1755.36
what happens when like

1752.9 --> 1757.5800000000002
evening consecutive in a very short time

1755.36 --> 1759.32
spent these kinds of things happen it's

1757.58 --> 1761.1789999999999
like a Cascade and then it's like oh

1759.32 --> 1762.86
[ __ ] is everything now gonna go like

1761.179 --> 1764.96
that

1762.86 --> 1766.82
uh

1764.96 --> 1769.419
everything is under a microscope when

1766.82 --> 1769.4189999999999
you find Fe

1769.58 --> 1774.74
topic should be scrutinized nothing said

1772.1 --> 1776.12
is to be accepted as truth

1774.74 --> 1778.24
well

1776.12 --> 1782.2399999999998
yeah

1778.24 --> 1783.32
well not not just accepted as truth

1782.24 --> 1788.0
without

1783.32 --> 1790.58
the testing without logic right

1788.0 --> 1793.58
every argument has to have

1790.58 --> 1795.74
a foundation and those foundations can

1793.58 --> 1797.299
be all kinds of things can be strong

1795.74 --> 1799.82
correlation

1797.299 --> 1801.2
can be a direct causation a provable

1799.82 --> 1803.72
causation

1801.2 --> 1806.0
it could be

1803.72 --> 1811.48
yeah

1806.0 --> 1811.48
just logic just logic right it's like

1816.08 --> 1821.779
but yeah if you say something in it and

1818.48 --> 1824.659
it cannot be questioned

1821.779 --> 1826.7
and then what's the point

1824.659 --> 1828.679
then it's just like a peer pressure game

1826.7 --> 1829.94
and guess what on the internet you never

1828.679 --> 1832.64
win those

1829.94 --> 1835.46
because there's trolls that dedicate

1832.64 --> 1837.7990000000002
their entire lives of just never

1835.46 --> 1840.279
stopping to push against that whatever

1837.799 --> 1840.279
it is

1846.679 --> 1852.3200000000002
dude if I'd had those types of things in

1849.74 --> 1855.02
in my way of going about I'd have knit

1852.32 --> 1859.48
like the trolls would never end then

1855.02 --> 1859.48
they would never leave me alone ever

1860.539 --> 1864.1
I'm glad that I don't do that

1869.539 --> 1872.74
anyway also yesterday

1876.57 --> 1879.23
[Music]

1878.28 --> 1893.12
[Applause]

1879.23 --> 1895.779
[Music]

1893.12 --> 1895.779
so

1901.81 --> 1905.02
[Music]

1907.47 --> 1914.809
[Music]

1918.02 --> 1922.22
okay

1920.0 --> 1924.2
right yeah I'm responding to flat side

1922.22 --> 1925.88
who's actually reacting to what I've

1924.2 --> 1928.52
been saying

1925.88 --> 1930.8600000000001
and he's

1928.52 --> 1933.52
well it seems to be paying a little bit

1930.86 --> 1933.52
more attention

1933.799 --> 1937.7
but uh yeah

1935.6 --> 1939.62
she has me blocked

1937.7 --> 1941.779
oh what is the problem yeah while she's

1939.62 --> 1943.58
still gossiping about me

1941.779 --> 1946.34
right this is really cute that she has

1943.58 --> 1948.9189999999999
me blocked but I'm still in the chat and

1946.34 --> 1952.9399999999998
she's still gossiping about me non-stop

1948.919 --> 1956.24
for like weeks weeks

1952.94 --> 1958.3400000000001
in the chat and then I notice even if I

1956.24 --> 1961.88
had error blocks because I would see

1958.34 --> 1964.1589999999999
other people respond to her with my name

1961.88 --> 1965.659
in it and hers

1964.159 --> 1968.48
okay

1965.659 --> 1971.3600000000001
so yeah that doesn't work

1968.48 --> 1974.24
just blocking doesn't work if somebody

1971.36 --> 1977.559
just keeps gossiping and slandering

1974.24 --> 1981.34
continuously in the chat

1977.559 --> 1981.34
that's not tolerable

1983.6 --> 1987.32
right flat side could you imagine that

1985.7 --> 1991.039
like

1987.32 --> 1993.559
you're in some chat

1991.039 --> 1995.48
and you're like continually surrounded

1993.559 --> 1997.7
by people that are just being super

1995.48 --> 1999.799
nasty to you and there's absolutely

1997.7 --> 2001.8990000000001
nothing you could do except ignore it

1999.799 --> 2003.46
would you like hanging around the place

2001.899 --> 2005.9799999999998
where that would continually happen

2003.46 --> 2008.8600000000001
would that be a fun place to hang around

2005.98 --> 2011.26
when you're continually seeing [ __ ]

2008.86 --> 2012.8799999999999
being talked about you non-stop you

2011.26 --> 2016.679
think that's fun

2012.88 --> 2016.679
flat Zoid no it's not

2018.76 --> 2022.24
and why the hell would you want to have

2020.5 --> 2024.899
somebody like that around anyway that

2022.24 --> 2024.8990000000001
talks like that

2025.539 --> 2030.8799999999999
like who gives a [ __ ] if there happened

2028.299 --> 2032.74
to be a flat earther they're misbehaving

2030.88 --> 2035.2
trash

2032.74 --> 2038.76
who cares

2035.2 --> 2038.76
what their philosophy is

2040.74 --> 2046.63
[Music]

2047.38 --> 2051.7000000000003
a bit of a complaining pants show I

2049.78 --> 2054.2200000000003
guess today didn't want that but I mean

2051.7 --> 2056.7999999999997
it has to be spoken has to be spoken out

2054.22 --> 2061.2599999999998
and I'm not agitated really

2056.8 --> 2061.26
I mostly just worried and disappointed

2064.1 --> 2068.919
[Applause]

2066.22 --> 2071.2799999999997
Nathan better damn well show up today

2068.919 --> 2071.2799999999997
it's

2071.92 --> 2074.949
[Music]

2086.17 --> 2089.38
[Music]

2093.46 --> 2097.989
foreign

2094.78 --> 2097.989
[Music]

2111.32 --> 2115.96
[Music]

2112.78 --> 2119.32
okay might be that there's no no flatter

2115.96 --> 2120.76
debates today too oh goody

2119.32 --> 2123.52
okay

2120.76 --> 2127.1400000000003
bring everything to Christ okay well

2123.52 --> 2127.14
that depends on what that means though

2129.22 --> 2134.74
right because I don't think Christ is

2131.38 --> 2138.2200000000003
God I think that Christ is an extremely

2134.74 --> 2140.5
important prophet of God

2138.22 --> 2143.3799999999997
not God himself

2140.5 --> 2145.359
and I'm never letting that go ever and I

2143.38 --> 2147.7000000000003
don't care if you call me a Muslim I say

2145.359 --> 2149.7999999999997
thank you thank you for calling me a

2147.7 --> 2152.74
Muslim that's an honor title to have

2149.8 --> 2156.7000000000003
because they at least get that

2152.74 --> 2160.06
play at least get what things really are

2156.7 --> 2162.22
in that sense concerning Christ and they

2160.06 --> 2166.06
have their own

2162.22 --> 2167.9199999999996
Paradigm issues with their own religion

2166.06 --> 2170.339
right so it's not like they are flawless

2167.92 --> 2170.339
or anything

2171.04 --> 2176.74
but yeah I'm just like no Christ is not

2174.46 --> 2180.64
God I'm sick of hearing that it is

2176.74 --> 2182.4399999999996
idolatry it is just idolatry that's just

2180.64 --> 2185.0989999999997
what it is

2182.44 --> 2188.02
it contradicts what Christ literally

2185.099 --> 2190.0
said and does in the Bible it makes

2188.02 --> 2193.92
absolutely no sense

2190.0 --> 2193.92
it is blasphemy

2195.88 --> 2201.4
it is

2198.099 --> 2203.2000000000003
by the the Old Testament standard it is

2201.4 --> 2207.599
blasphemy

2203.2 --> 2207.5989999999997
and I am not gonna sway

2213.22 --> 2217.2999999999997
uh

2214.48 --> 2221.7
we know about the sacraments

2217.3 --> 2221.7000000000003
I know I recognize the word but I

2222.82 --> 2228.6600000000003
isn't that like a

2224.74 --> 2228.66
a church ritual basically

2235.44 --> 2242.099
what is that again

2237.66 --> 2242.0989999999997
so please elaborate tiger bear

2246.4 --> 2250.2400000000002
that's a tough one you grew up in

2248.26 --> 2252.76
churches that thought yeah no all teach

2250.24 --> 2255.66
all churches teach that and it's always

2252.76 --> 2255.6600000000003
horseshit

2256.02 --> 2260.8
it's idolatry and it's completely

2258.88 --> 2265.1800000000003
pointless

2260.8 --> 2268.3590000000004
and it is against Christ's wishes

2265.18 --> 2271.48
it's a satanic trap

2268.359 --> 2273.88
it's literally the devil as I said

2271.48 --> 2276.88
having taken

2273.88 --> 2279.76
Christ teaching encapsulating it and

2276.88 --> 2282.76
then doing exactly the opposite with as

2279.76 --> 2286.42
many things as possible making people do

2282.76 --> 2289.7200000000003
exactly the opposite of what he taught

2286.42 --> 2292.54
with them ending up believing that

2289.72 --> 2294.7599999999998
they're actually doing what Christ says

2292.54 --> 2298.079
when they're not

2294.76 --> 2298.079
that's what I think it is

2305.38 --> 2310.6600000000003
okay well Jane's favorite videos is cute

2308.5 --> 2313.24
that you believe that but it doesn't

2310.66 --> 2317.74
make any sense

2313.24 --> 2319.839
and it never will and it is idolatry and

2317.74 --> 2322.4199999999996
it is illogical and it contradicts what

2319.839 --> 2325.48
Christ said

2322.42 --> 2328.48
Christ have said a couple of esoteric

2325.48 --> 2330.579
things for sure things that were well

2328.48 --> 2332.8
not literal because literally it doesn't

2330.579 --> 2336.3390000000004
make any sense so it would have to be

2332.8 --> 2339.119
esoteric spiritual metaphysical

2336.339 --> 2343.66
right but when it comes to things

2339.119 --> 2347.02
described in the Bible yet those aren't

2343.66 --> 2350.92
metaphysical those are literal yeah if

2347.02 --> 2353.2
something is said to happen like a

2350.92 --> 2355.839
person walks there he does this he does

2353.2 --> 2358.2999999999997
yeah that's not metaphorical that's

2355.839 --> 2361.9
literal

2358.3 --> 2363.88
and I uphold things in the Bible by that

2361.9 --> 2366.1600000000003
standard yeah if somebody says something

2363.88 --> 2368.7400000000002
yeah that could be literal could be

2366.16 --> 2371.0789999999997
metaphorical in the Bible they say

2368.74 --> 2373.4799999999996
something yeah

2371.079 --> 2378.099
you can argue about that but if

2373.48 --> 2382.0
something is described to happen then it

2378.099 --> 2382.0
is not metaphorical

2382.599 --> 2388.48
and whatever then

2384.76 --> 2391.8390000000004
is believed about

2388.48 --> 2394.78
what how that still ties in with the for

2391.839 --> 2399.359
example the Trinity belief well that's

2394.78 --> 2399.3590000000004
just men that's men

2399.46 --> 2402.599
making it up

2408.12 --> 2411.179
[Music]

2416.14 --> 2422.46
Peter warned that William misinterpret

2419.32 --> 2422.46
Paul to their own destruction

2427.72 --> 2433.8999999999996
but it's it's not even just that because

2430.119 --> 2437.26
he has become the he is

2433.9 --> 2440.099
the prophet according to the church Paul

2437.26 --> 2444.4
is technically the prophet that

2440.099 --> 2449.56
supersedes Christ oh what they don't

2444.4 --> 2451.3
overtly say it yeah but they do actually

2449.56 --> 2454.72
they just

2451.3 --> 2457.1800000000003
don't call it the Church of Paul

2454.72 --> 2460.06
they still put Christ in the name yeah

2457.18 --> 2461.6189999999997
but it was actually hijacked in its

2460.06 --> 2464.5
methodologies and approach and

2461.619 --> 2466.48
traditions because of Paul and it's you

2464.5 --> 2469.26
can literally ask them and they will say

2466.48 --> 2469.26
it is so

2471.48 --> 2478.0
marriage is the sacrament okay so it's a

2475.54 --> 2482.4
Sacrament like a holy vow

2478.0 --> 2482.4
a promise to God then that makes sense

2482.619 --> 2486.7200000000003
sorry I didn't like Googling or anything

2484.42 --> 2486.7200000000003
but

2486.88 --> 2492.7000000000003
I mean yeah I mean

2489.94 --> 2494.5
I consider marriage as sacred

2492.7 --> 2497.2599999999998
absolutely

2494.5 --> 2501.76
but that's because of God it's not

2497.26 --> 2504.5200000000004
because of a church tradition that's God

2501.76 --> 2508.6600000000003
you don't need

2504.52 --> 2510.7599999999998
like a church approval of a marriage

2508.66 --> 2513.22
to be under Christ you can literally

2510.76 --> 2517.3
just say

2513.22 --> 2520.6189999999997
you can say like we are marrying

2517.3 --> 2520.619
and under God

2521.26 --> 2527.0200000000004
and you have to mean it though I mean

2524.619 --> 2528.52
but the same goes for a regular church

2527.02 --> 2530.56
you can be in there like yeah we're

2528.52 --> 2533.859
we're marrying under God but you're not

2530.56 --> 2535.66
really all that into it you're just you

2533.859 --> 2539.2599999999998
want kind of that cover like that's

2535.66 --> 2540.7599999999998
communion blanket of church over you why

2539.26 --> 2542.38
but you don't really take marriages

2540.76 --> 2547.92
series well guess what those marriages

2542.38 --> 2547.92
tend to break apart eventually anyway

2549.28 --> 2556.0
right so marriage in the church does not

2552.64 --> 2558.66
give you like this foolproof blessing it

2556.0 --> 2558.66
makes no difference

2558.9 --> 2564.2200000000003
foreign

2561.18 --> 2566.98
makes a difference is that you

2564.22 --> 2571.14
make that promise to God that you let

2566.98 --> 2571.14
God Be Your witness of the marriage

2571.3 --> 2574.98
and that both mean it

2581.38 --> 2586.48
I change everything I haven't actually

2583.599 --> 2589.3590000000004
read the Quran

2586.48 --> 2592.48
but I've heard a lot of people about

2589.359 --> 2597.94
I've heard people out about it

2592.48 --> 2599.619
I like back in the day I was like there

2597.94 --> 2602.079
were some Muslim people

2599.619 --> 2605.38
like in my teens that I had

2602.079 --> 2608.079
conversations with about the Quran and I

2605.38 --> 2610.119
would kind of be poking them but in my

2608.079 --> 2614.2000000000003
journey back then because it's the same

2610.119 --> 2616.9
with Christianity different churches

2614.2 --> 2618.7599999999998
I ended up with more respect for all the

2616.9 --> 2621.099
the Muslims that I came across even

2618.76 --> 2624.28
though they did have flaws then with the

2621.099 --> 2626.6400000000003
churches that would literally go savanye

2624.28 --> 2626.6400000000003
on me

2632.98 --> 2641.16
so but that's my experience from what is

2636.46 --> 2641.16
it now 25 30 years ago

2647.859 --> 2653.44
right the tone who's I've never read the

2650.98 --> 2655.54
talmuda

2653.44 --> 2658.839
what I know about it

2655.54 --> 2661.18
somebody actually threatened me over it

2658.839 --> 2663.54
because I thought that I I said that I

2661.18 --> 2663.54
read it

2664.06 --> 2668.5
but I didn't I just

2666.4 --> 2671.04
I kind of bluffed it I didn't even know

2668.5 --> 2671.04
what it was

2673.3 --> 2678.3
yeah and it was the General guy

2675.88 --> 2678.3
anyway

2687.359 --> 2694.44
young what's business is it of yours

2691.3 --> 2694.44
what anybody believes

2696.0 --> 2702.94
what I was trying to figure it out

2700.359 --> 2707.339
I was trying to see like is what they're

2702.94 --> 2707.339
doing actually good and with God

2711.4 --> 2718.3
how is that not my business

2715.18 --> 2721.4199999999996
when I'm trying to figure out like what

2718.3 --> 2724.599
is God what what group could I be a part

2721.42 --> 2728.16
of why wouldn't I

2724.599 --> 2728.1600000000003
why wouldn't it be my business

2728.56 --> 2736.839
I didn't try to change them or anything

2733.119 --> 2739.599
I didn't like condemn them I would just

2736.839 --> 2742.24
figure out like you are misled there's

2739.599 --> 2743.8590000000004
no point for me to associate with this

2742.24 --> 2748.06
because

2743.859 --> 2750.2799999999997
there will not be any learning for me

2748.06 --> 2752.98
because I'll just continually bump into

2750.28 --> 2757.2400000000002
these chants and these illogical

2752.98 --> 2759.96
reasonings that you refuse to get Beyond

2757.24 --> 2759.9599999999996
so

2760.48 --> 2764.44
yeah

2761.98 --> 2767.14
I mean if I'm gonna go to a church then

2764.44 --> 2771.88
you better damn well believe that I want

2767.14 --> 2773.5789999999997
actual serious philosophical debate here

2771.88 --> 2776.5
and not just

2773.579 --> 2780.099
braiding with scripture

2776.5 --> 2782.14
I want to actually this debate like what

2780.099 --> 2786.54
is this is what he said literal or

2782.14 --> 2786.54
metaphorical how do we know

2787.0 --> 2790.72
and then I want people's opinion on the

2789.7 --> 2792.3999999999996
spot

2790.72 --> 2794.4399999999996
and what they're referring to yeah

2792.4 --> 2798.099
that's the thing that I like to do I

2794.44 --> 2800.2000000000003
don't just like oh yes oh oh now I

2798.099 --> 2802.48
understand why you have to say it like

2800.2 --> 2806.02
this yeah I'll just be one of you that

2802.48 --> 2808.96
no no no no

2806.02 --> 2812.44
I'm going to test it

2808.96 --> 2815.92
you can't stop me unless you kick me out

2812.44 --> 2818.02
if I'm gonna be there I'm gonna test it

2815.92 --> 2821.26
I'm not gonna try to ruin everybody's

2818.02 --> 2824.2
day but I will seek my moment and I will

2821.26 --> 2828.0600000000004
do that I will not let you comfortably

2824.2 --> 2831.7
Slumber in your short-sighted illusions

2828.06 --> 2835.98
that you think is all right

2831.7 --> 2835.98
I will figure it out

2838.66 --> 2841.2599999999998
anyway

2853.5 --> 2859.68
right yeah Jane's favorite videos yeah

2856.3 --> 2859.6800000000003
that's cute those promises

2867.3 --> 2872.8
72 wides wow what the hell are you gonna

2870.16 --> 2875.3799999999997
do with 72 wives I don't know

2872.8 --> 2877.0
but in heaven I don't think that I mean

2875.38 --> 2880.3
what

2877.0 --> 2882.22
it's just like a oh look this is what

2880.3 --> 2884.7400000000002
you can get thing that's what it feels

2882.22 --> 2887.2599999999998
like to me oh 72 wives because like why

2884.74 --> 2889.72
would there be any limit

2887.26 --> 2892.0600000000004
like if you truly

2889.72 --> 2893.859
achieve

2892.06 --> 2896.38
like Direct

2893.859 --> 2900.339
connection with with Allah in this case

2896.38 --> 2901.9
like why would there be any limit

2900.339 --> 2905.4
you know

2901.9 --> 2905.4
in in the Beyond

2907.9 --> 2912.7200000000003
read the rest

2910.06 --> 2912.72
okay

2916.3 --> 2922.5600000000004
two from hours is in 70 from internet

2920.02 --> 2922.56
what

2928.78 --> 2934.02
yeah

2930.64 --> 2934.02
okay that's kind of gross

2944.14 --> 2950.859
okay like hey

2947.5 --> 2954.94
okay if you choose you what you feel to

2950.859 --> 2956.859
be over what Christ says then

2954.94 --> 2960.06
well

2956.859 --> 2960.06
do what you want

2961.3 --> 2965.319
yeah I don't pray to Christ I pray to

2964.24 --> 2969.4599999999996
God

2965.319 --> 2973.68
but I do invoke Christ

2969.46 --> 2977.619
like why what is part of my personal

2973.68 --> 2980.2
chant or like a spell that I cast on

2977.619 --> 2983.1400000000003
myself it's a prayer

2980.2 --> 2985.48
but it's not a prayer to Christ as God

2983.14 --> 2986.6189999999997
but Christ is part of the prayer I ask

2985.48 --> 2989.319
him

2986.619 --> 2991.7200000000003
or I invoke his name in the name of

2989.319 --> 2994.079
Jesus Christ keep me on the straight

2991.72 --> 2994.0789999999997
path

2994.9 --> 3001.859
that's directly invoking his wisdom and

2998.079 --> 3005.119
his teachings not him as God

3001.859 --> 3005.119
because he isn't God

3007.44 --> 3012.3
but

3008.76 --> 3015.1800000000003
he is certainly one that can bring

3012.3 --> 3018.2000000000003
everybody that recognizes that very

3015.18 --> 3018.2
close to God

3018.9 --> 3021.5
foreign

3021.9 --> 3027.26
a lot of blessings to the Earth

3024.54 --> 3027.2599999999998
as well

3030.06 --> 3037.74
but I mean the majority of the world has

3032.28 --> 3037.7400000000002
been completely deluded about Christ for

3038.16 --> 3041.54
uncounted Generations

3042.42 --> 3045.06
so I don't think you're going to be

3043.8 --> 3048.3
cursed

3045.06 --> 3051.0789999999997
by doing it it's just that

3048.3 --> 3051.079
it's

3051.359 --> 3056.7599999999998
well you already said it he literally

3053.579 --> 3060.26
said not to do that so yeah you draw

3056.76 --> 3060.26
your conclusion right

3061.619 --> 3064.099
anyway

3073.16 --> 3078.0589999999997
I totally agree with that

3075.66 --> 3081.2
path is narrow thank you for quoting

3078.059 --> 3081.2000000000003
that awesome

3081.24 --> 3085.819
it's how you pray as well I was like

3083.099 --> 3085.819
where okay cool

3086.04 --> 3089.819
all right but I also invoke Archangel

3088.5 --> 3092.4
Michael

3089.819 --> 3093.839
and Raphael

3092.4 --> 3097.76
that you might think of that whatever

3093.839 --> 3097.7599999999998
you want maybe that's like oh it's

3098.819 --> 3104.94
Pagan or something else I don't know I

3102.42 --> 3107.4
don't think so

3104.94 --> 3109.5
but it's also at least Rudolph Steiner

3107.4 --> 3113.04
compatible

3109.5 --> 3114.48
and I definitely trust a lot about those

3113.04 --> 3117.9
teachings

3114.48 --> 3120.119
so I also invoke Archangel Michael right

3117.9 --> 3123.839
Jesus Christ get me on the straight path

3120.119 --> 3125.1600000000003
Archangel Michael protect me from the

3123.839 --> 3127.5
dark ones

3125.16 --> 3130.5589999999997
because that's what he does actually

3127.5 --> 3132.72
especially when you evoke him and

3130.559 --> 3134.28
Archangel Raphael keep my heart in the

3132.72 --> 3137.54
right place

3134.28 --> 3137.5400000000004
so that I don't

3139.2 --> 3145.0789999999997
yeah so that I can basically keep that

3142.26 --> 3147.96
straight path and not like lose all my

3145.079 --> 3151.1600000000003
patience and temper and all that

3147.96 --> 3151.16
so that's what I do

3153.18 --> 3158.46
and it works extremely well

3156.72 --> 3161.9399999999996
to do that

3158.46 --> 3165.3
on me it really helps me Focus I I say

3161.94 --> 3166.92
it every night before I go to bed

3165.3 --> 3168.78
anyway

3166.92 --> 3171.619
hello

3168.78 --> 3171.619
a Cleary

3181.98 --> 3188.46
right yes ciao young cat right because

3183.9 --> 3192.119
when I do my prayer it say

3188.46 --> 3193.2
all of that is under God I mean Jesus

3192.119 --> 3196.02
Christ

3193.2 --> 3198.8999999999996
is directly

3196.02 --> 3201.96
in God like I see God as everything

3198.9 --> 3205.6800000000003
Jesus Christ in there then Archangel

3201.96 --> 3210.18
Michael very key role in there Archangel

3205.68 --> 3213.5989999999997
Raphael also a designated Angelic role

3210.18 --> 3219.7999999999997
all under God but I don't say it I don't

3213.599 --> 3219.8
say oh God no I re I rarely do that

3222.0 --> 3229.079
but I always when I reference those

3225.24 --> 3232.5
things when I pray it's always for me

3229.079 --> 3235.559
for my Consciousness under God

3232.5 --> 3237.42
like that is the the antecedent for it

3235.559 --> 3240.5400000000004
none of those things would have any

3237.42 --> 3242.96
logical Point even existing without God

3240.54 --> 3242.96
to me

3261.68 --> 3267.6189999999997
foreign

3263.599 --> 3267.619
's favorite videos whatever

3269.22 --> 3273.18
dude by their actions you shall know

3271.02 --> 3275.52
them I mean the Bible says a couple are

3273.18 --> 3277.819
really as of some really brutal stories

3275.52 --> 3277.819
too

3278.28 --> 3286.3190000000004
they're like Psychopathic almost

3282.24 --> 3288.8999999999996
oh well not almost so it's what you

3286.319 --> 3293.04
learn from it and I and I approach the

3288.9 --> 3294.54
same with the with the Quran although I

3293.04 --> 3297.119
just don't know

3294.54 --> 3300.2599999999998
enough about the talmud to even so I

3297.119 --> 3300.26
don't know if it is

3301.68 --> 3306.02
it should be judged on the same level

3316.079 --> 3321.6600000000003
right so it's not about

3318.72 --> 3324.24
it's not about literally what happens

3321.66 --> 3325.6189999999997
in there it's about what you learn from

3324.24 --> 3328.319
it

3325.619 --> 3331.26
not saying that things don't literally

3328.319 --> 3332.64
happen as they are shared in there but

3331.26 --> 3334.44
that's not what it's about it's not

3332.64 --> 3338.22
about oh that is how you should be no

3334.44 --> 3340.02
that is a lesson that you can learn from

3338.22 --> 3343.2
it

3340.02 --> 3346.339
and get a new view on how things work

3343.2 --> 3346.339
and what you should do

3353.76 --> 3360.599
sound recommend it over but yeah

3357.42 --> 3363.38
well it has like from what I heard the

3360.599 --> 3366.599
talmud describes Christ in a really

3363.38 --> 3369.0
patronizing disrespectful way and that

3366.599 --> 3370.319
makes it kind of No-No that is just

3369.0 --> 3372.059
ridiculous

3370.319 --> 3375.8
and foolish

3372.059 --> 3375.8
foolish it is literally

3376.92 --> 3381.26
don't have the Bible without yeah I

3378.839 --> 3381.2599999999998
disagree

3383.04 --> 3390.18
I mean yeah he's in there it's just that

3387.0 --> 3391.319
he I see him as the challenge he is the

3390.18 --> 3394.5789999999997
grappler

3391.319 --> 3397.68
that is testing your faith in Christ

3394.579 --> 3401.819
guess what

3397.68 --> 3404.7
most people utterly fail that test and

3401.819 --> 3406.5589999999997
nobody is even there to point it out on

3404.7 --> 3410.04
average because they'll get kicked out

3406.559 --> 3412.7400000000002
of the church right

3410.04 --> 3414.839
because when push comes to shove people

3412.74 --> 3418.68
will say yeah if you don't accept Paul

3414.839 --> 3421.0789999999997
you're not a Christian then yeah

3418.68 --> 3423.72
okay paulian

3421.079 --> 3424.92
I'll be a Christian you'll be appallian

3423.72 --> 3426.839
okay

3424.92 --> 3431.28
because I follow Christ and his

3426.839 --> 3432.92
teachings not Paul and his warping

3431.28 --> 3436.92
his

3432.92 --> 3439.859
re-engineering his prophecy

3436.92 --> 3443.599
that trumps Christ yeah I don't do that

3439.859 --> 3443.5989999999997
no I don't

3450.42 --> 3453.38
know yeah

3457.8 --> 3462.42
negative commentary I don't know I just

3460.619 --> 3463.8
know that there are certain things said

3462.42 --> 3466.7000000000003
about Christ

3463.8 --> 3466.7000000000003
and

3467.4 --> 3472.04
well I don't feel I really need to know

3469.8 --> 3472.04
more

3483.839 --> 3488.4
but God would never love you mean the

3486.48 --> 3490.2
can I see in Council

3488.4 --> 3492.7400000000002
what do you mean God wouldn't have

3490.2 --> 3492.74
allowed it

3496.92 --> 3500.16
uh

3498.24 --> 3503.5989999999997
there's been a whole bunch of

3500.16 --> 3503.5989999999997
alterations of the Bible

3503.88 --> 3508.92
even after that yeah God allowed that I

3507.42 --> 3512.28
mean

3508.92 --> 3514.5
what do you think the Book of Mormon

3512.28 --> 3517.02
God allowed that

3514.5 --> 3519.72
or didn't he

3517.02 --> 3521.7599999999998
so you don't make much of an argument

3519.72 --> 3525.839
there Italian cat right just God

3521.76 --> 3527.94
allowing it is not an excuse God allows

3525.839 --> 3529.619
everything which is nothing without

3527.94 --> 3531.48
consequences everything we do as

3529.619 --> 3533.46
consequences but he does allow it he

3531.48 --> 3536.099
doesn't force you

3533.46 --> 3538.92
right like that

3536.099 --> 3541.1400000000003
so yeah God allows everybody to make a

3538.92 --> 3543.48
mistake even if that is

3541.14 --> 3545.0989999999997
really egregious

3543.48 --> 3546.18
that's just how it works that's the

3545.099 --> 3548.7000000000003
design

3546.18 --> 3552.359
it's how things work

3548.7 --> 3554.0989999999997
okay but yeah the Nicene Council that

3552.359 --> 3556.02
was people that was people that

3554.099 --> 3561.619
assembled the Bible

3556.02 --> 3561.619
and they decided on the doctrine

3563.64 --> 3570.299
yeah not God was people in the nicenean

3567.18 --> 3571.3799999999997
council that decided on what the Bible

3570.299 --> 3574.28
would be

3571.38 --> 3574.28
not God

3574.559 --> 3581.3390000000004
and God allows books of every sort to be

3578.88 --> 3582.78
created and published and spread and

3581.339 --> 3585.0
popularized

3582.78 --> 3587.599
right plenty of them out there so it's

3585.0 --> 3587.599
not an argument

3590.819 --> 3595.5
nobody takes the book's Mormon series

3592.98 --> 3598.44
but the Mormons well then right well

3595.5 --> 3601.76
then what kind of argument do you have

3598.44 --> 3601.76
you don't have one then

3605.52 --> 3609.359
what the funk is wrong with Paul exactly

3607.68 --> 3611.46
well that he was a little sniveling

3609.359 --> 3617.4
Grappler and a murderer of Christians

3611.46 --> 3621.059
who literally Idol idolizes Jesus

3617.4 --> 3623.28
and changes his words literally like a

3621.059 --> 3625.92
lot of his rudimentary teachings he just

3623.28 --> 3631.26
says no no it's like this oh that's what

3625.92 --> 3631.26
he told me yeah false witness blasphemy

3634.559 --> 3641.52
the only reason why people accept that

3638.22 --> 3644.64
within church is because priests tell

3641.52 --> 3648.2599999999998
them to accept it and that it's okay

3644.64 --> 3648.2599999999998
that's the only reason

3649.14 --> 3654.18
if they hadn't been there to Tell the

3652.38 --> 3656.579
readers that are stumbling into that

3654.18 --> 3659.46
about that to think about it like that

3656.579 --> 3662.4
then people would realize like this guy

3659.46 --> 3665.2400000000002
is an infiltrator he actually ruined

3662.4 --> 3665.2400000000002
Christ's teachings

3675.98 --> 3682.5
it was before upon Christ yeah and then

3678.839 --> 3684.7799999999997
after he found Christ he altered his

3682.5 --> 3688.559
teachings and he bared fault witness

3684.78 --> 3693.0
about seeing him and giving him the

3688.559 --> 3697.1600000000003
authority to change the teachings yeah

3693.0 --> 3697.16
who gives a [ __ ] if it was before

3697.5 --> 3700.579
it's ridiculous

3711.9 --> 3719.48
the man was a assassin

3716.28 --> 3721.0400000000004
assassin grabbler and he basically

3719.48 --> 3724.92
retired

3721.04 --> 3727.46
converting to this Christianity and then

3724.92 --> 3732.7400000000002
altering it to suit his personal

3727.46 --> 3732.7400000000002
longings more yeah that's what happened

3735.0 --> 3739.92
can a Jewish rabbi become anti-gram but

3738.18 --> 3742.94
just because you're a Jew doesn't make

3739.92 --> 3742.94
you a Graveler though

3743.22 --> 3750.9199999999996
although for some reason Jews do tend to

3746.819 --> 3750.92
have more Graveler tendencies

3752.16 --> 3758.819
but any type of

3755.4 --> 3762.359
person or religion can be a Grappler you

3758.819 --> 3764.04
have grabblers in every religion

3762.359 --> 3767.299
they're out there for power they

3764.04 --> 3767.299
manipulate they twist

3767.88 --> 3770.88
foreign

3771.92 --> 3778.16
and they lie often and keep it a very

3775.559 --> 3778.1600000000003
strict Secret

3788.579 --> 3793.76
about triple

3791.28 --> 3793.76
well

3796.14 --> 3800.8799999999997
Peter

3797.7 --> 3802.98
was then also post-christ just like Paul

3800.88 --> 3805.38
yeah sure hey if a lot of people all

3802.98 --> 3807.9
come together like way after this all

3805.38 --> 3809.579
happened they're like yeah yeah we agree

3807.9 --> 3811.44
that it should be different all of us

3809.579 --> 3814.98
yeah yeah guess what that is that's

3811.44 --> 3818.099
everybody agreeing on changing Christ's

3814.98 --> 3821.7
teachings making it no longer Christ's

3818.099 --> 3824.819
teachings but changed teachings based on

3821.7 --> 3828.0589999999997
Paul and Peter then I guess yeah that's

3824.819 --> 3829.88
what that is that's literally what that

3828.059 --> 3832.98
is

3829.88 --> 3834.839
literally it's not our it's not up for

3832.98 --> 3837.859
argumentation it's literally what that

3834.839 --> 3837.859
is that's what it happened

3838.319 --> 3841.7
it's pure logic

3842.339 --> 3848.359
Peter wasn't post Christ well how could

3844.799 --> 3851.52
he then ever vouch for Paul that makes

3848.359 --> 3854.88
absolutely no sense

3851.52 --> 3858.319
what after his death he vouched for him

3854.88 --> 3858.319
oh who told you that

3864.72 --> 3868.6189999999997
yeah I don't care

3866.4 --> 3872.1600000000003
yeah

3868.619 --> 3874.44
who as far as I'm concerned Peter might

3872.16 --> 3877.2599999999998
be saying exactly the opposite oh if you

3874.44 --> 3880.559
misinterpret Paul you're in big trouble

3877.26 --> 3883.5
yeah oh but maybe actually man like yeah

3880.559 --> 3885.5400000000004
because he's there to test everybody and

3883.5 --> 3889.099
if you get fooled by it

3885.54 --> 3889.099
yeah you're screwed

3889.859 --> 3893.48
so I'm gonna interpret it like that

3894.72 --> 3901.3999999999996
without Peter Oppo who's left

3897.66 --> 3904.3999999999996
there isn't anybody left yeah

3901.4 --> 3907.98
the Romans

3904.4 --> 3910.28
destroyed it all

3907.98 --> 3917.339
and then

3910.28 --> 3921.3190000000004
re-founded Christianity in their image

3917.339 --> 3921.319
that's what happened

3921.72 --> 3926.339
yeah

3922.98 --> 3929.16
they destroyed it

3926.339 --> 3932.22
and then re-wrote it

3929.16 --> 3934.799
and then that became the Christianity

3932.22 --> 3937.0789999999997
and theology came out of that and they

3934.799 --> 3940.079
literally went around the world to

3937.079 --> 3944.1600000000003
ensure that that would be the

3940.079 --> 3948.1800000000003
Christianity to literally remove all

3944.16 --> 3949.44
remnants of pure Christ teachings

3948.18 --> 3952.5789999999997
yeah

3949.44 --> 3952.579
and other stuff too

3960.78 --> 3963.96
I'm sorry it must be very frustrating

3962.579 --> 3966.78
but this is what it is I've never

3963.96 --> 3968.88
stopped I'm never stopping this never I

3966.78 --> 3970.44
will never let this go

3968.88 --> 3973.02
ever

3970.44 --> 3976.7400000000002
you're gonna have to kill me for it

3973.02 --> 3979.619
because I will never stop saying the

3976.74 --> 3981.839
absolute in your face logical truth

3979.619 --> 3983.2200000000003
about what happened

3981.839 --> 3985.38
because that is what it is not

3983.22 --> 3987.299
interpretation it's literally what

3985.38 --> 3991.28
happened and I will

3987.299 --> 3991.28
continue saying it

3991.559 --> 3996.3590000000004
you can take my rental I don't have to

3993.599 --> 3997.8590000000004
are you misbehaving

3996.359 --> 4002.2599999999998
if you don't want to be here then just

3997.859 --> 4002.2599999999998
leave just leave in your protest then

4002.48 --> 4006.14
I don't need to take your wrench you're

4004.28 --> 4009.579
not misbehaving

4006.14 --> 4009.5789999999997
you're just disagreeing

4009.68 --> 4015.6189999999997
fine you can disagree all you want I'm

4011.839 --> 4020.0789999999997
just telling you I will never change

4015.619 --> 4020.079
my vantage point in this argument ever

4021.88 --> 4025.079
[Music]

4034.88 --> 4039.02
I miss no I didn't miss any comment I've

4037.099 --> 4042.339
been reading your comment every every

4039.02 --> 4042.339
one of them so

4046.119 --> 4051.02
foreign

4048.02 --> 4051.02
over

4055.839 --> 4061.88
I mean I am pushing you a bit by just

4059.0 --> 4063.5
being as open about this right

4061.88 --> 4066.319
but that doesn't mean I have to take

4063.5 --> 4068.42
your rents you're not offending me

4066.319 --> 4070.579
you just don't have an argument and

4068.42 --> 4072.319
you're frustrated about it and I do have

4070.579 --> 4074.559
an argument and I know what I'm talking

4072.319 --> 4074.5589999999997
about

4082.46 --> 4092.329
foreign

4085.39 --> 4092.3289999999997
[Music]

4093.859 --> 4100.759
it was a huge exhilaration for me when

4098.06 --> 4102.7390000000005
Owen Benjamin started talking about this

4100.759 --> 4106.219
because that had been my frustration

4102.739 --> 4107.599999999999
with the Bible for a very long time

4106.219 --> 4110.42
foreign

4107.6 --> 4112.9400000000005
is that I have I am very much about

4110.42 --> 4114.679
Christ I really like every time he says

4112.94 --> 4116.839
and or does anything

4114.679 --> 4120.5
and it fascinates me because he does

4116.839 --> 4122.54
talk esoterically it's I seem to be one

4120.5 --> 4125.38
of the few people that it persistently

4122.54 --> 4128.48
understands that and and doesn't just

4125.38 --> 4129.9800000000005
rearrange interpretation to suit their

4128.48 --> 4132.459999999999
Dogma

4129.98 --> 4132.459999999999
yeah

4132.56 --> 4138.080000000001
and every time Christians frustrate me

4135.62 --> 4139.88
wherever I went even with the Mormon

4138.08 --> 4142.94
Church they did that [ __ ] and I'm like

4139.88 --> 4145.719
I'm sick of this I I can't deal with

4142.94 --> 4149.12
people constantly like

4145.719 --> 4152.54
no it's like this oh or you're not part

4149.12 --> 4155.66
of it uh like [ __ ] off not you Charlie

4152.54 --> 4158.0
and cat but in general just like I'm

4155.66 --> 4160.5199999999995
sick of that

4158.0 --> 4162.38
but I do definitely I consider myself

4160.52 --> 4165.620000000001
Christian so I was like I'm a Christian

4162.38 --> 4168.799
I'm just not your type of Christian you

4165.62 --> 4172.04
can't call it a Christian who right well

4168.799 --> 4176.42
technically my version is more Christian

4172.04 --> 4179.0
as in Jesus Christ word related

4176.42 --> 4180.1990000000005
his word his actions his methods his

4179.0 --> 4184.6
path

4180.199 --> 4187.339
then all the other supposed Dogma

4184.6 --> 4191.54
Christians out there

4187.339 --> 4191.54
that are actually paulians

4200.78 --> 4205.59
[Music]

4211.699 --> 4217.419999999999
following the teachings from Jesus is

4214.04 --> 4217.42
totally different from being religious

4217.64 --> 4220.719
technically yeah

4221.239 --> 4224.08
I guess

4224.54 --> 4230.06
but yeah the word religious is kind of

4227.84 --> 4231.92
complicated like that right there's

4230.06 --> 4233.84
different interpretations of that even

4231.92 --> 4235.88
if you look up the definition like oh

4233.84 --> 4236.96
you believe in a deity or something

4235.88 --> 4238.82
right

4236.96 --> 4241.84
like

4238.82 --> 4244.28
but if you mean like just a community

4241.84 --> 4248.12
religious like you're part of a group

4244.28 --> 4249.739
you don't necessarily even understand it

4248.12 --> 4251.84
fully

4249.739 --> 4254.98
well the way that I

4251.84 --> 4258.5
do Christianity it is

4254.98 --> 4261.259999999999
exclusively about understanding it like

4258.5 --> 4264.38
that is the main point

4261.26 --> 4267.7390000000005
is more the main point than anything

4264.38 --> 4271.28
else is actually understanding it and

4267.739 --> 4272.659
not being misled by men yeah trust God

4271.28 --> 4275.78
not men

4272.659 --> 4277.699
when I say trust God

4275.78 --> 4279.5599999999995
it is

4277.699 --> 4281.54
a little bit complicated because I'm

4279.56 --> 4284.179
actually being a little esoteric there

4281.54 --> 4285.46
right because God in that sense is the

4284.179 --> 4290.36
truth

4285.46 --> 4291.8
logic trust the truth and logic not what

4290.36 --> 4297.88
men say

4291.8 --> 4297.88
when they contradict the truth or logic

4303.96 --> 4307.039
[Music]

4308.239 --> 4313.12
how did Christ feel about you yeah I

4310.88 --> 4313.12
know

4324.32 --> 4329.48
okay be willing to die for whatever I

4327.32 --> 4332.42
will I am

4329.48 --> 4333.919999999999
I'm literally being crushed

4332.42 --> 4337.34
socially

4333.92 --> 4340.159
by half the world yeah

4337.34 --> 4341.659000000001
because I freaking hate satanists I've

4340.159 --> 4344.239
been among them

4341.659 --> 4346.46
they hate them they're totally pointless

4344.239 --> 4348.98
all their freedom

4346.46 --> 4350.54
is like oh we figured out it's fake and

4348.98 --> 4354.5
what are you gonna do there with that

4350.54 --> 4357.32
well misbehave like a piece of [ __ ] oh

4354.5 --> 4360.159
yeah well that's not gonna fix anything

4357.32 --> 4363.32
so I'm literally stuck between these

4360.159 --> 4366.86
deluded Christians and their Dogma

4363.32 --> 4369.5599999999995
and satanists with their insanity

4366.86 --> 4372.259999999999
and their irresponsibility and I've kind

4369.56 --> 4373.400000000001
of always been stuck in between that

4372.26 --> 4376.58
yeah

4373.4 --> 4378.739
that's suffering socially

4376.58 --> 4381.8
being ostracized never being actually

4378.739 --> 4385.639999999999
part of a group never being to just able

4381.8 --> 4388.179
to smoothly dissolve in in group

4385.64 --> 4390.56
psychology Dynamics

4388.179 --> 4393.5
because you know everybody thinks

4390.56 --> 4396.1990000000005
exactly like you did because I there

4393.5 --> 4399.38
isn't any there isn't any out there I

4396.199 --> 4401.719
mean Owen Benjamin streams like the way

4399.38 --> 4404.900000000001
that he talks about things has been the

4401.719 --> 4406.82
closest I've ever come to finding a

4404.9 --> 4409.04
group dynamic where I can actually

4406.82 --> 4411.32
dissolve into

4409.04 --> 4414.159
like since I was a little kid it's the

4411.32 --> 4414.159
first thing ever

4415.66 --> 4419.3099999999995
[Music]

4421.57 --> 4424.84
[Music]

4425.3 --> 4427.6
hello

4434.88 --> 4439.400000000001
[Music]

4436.6 --> 4442.06
good work yeah

4439.4 --> 4442.0599999999995
cool

4442.94 --> 4446.719
cool all right now if you do the right

4444.739 --> 4448.218999999999
thing if you follow Jesus's advice if

4446.719 --> 4450.92
you actually do good

4448.219 --> 4452.78
now good will come to you and God will

4450.92 --> 4455.36
help you to complete I totally agree

4452.78 --> 4457.46
with that yeah not everything that is

4455.36 --> 4459.5599999999995
said in the Bible is wrong

4457.46 --> 4461.36
even if it hasn't been said by Jesus

4459.56 --> 4463.159000000001
there's a lot of good things that are

4461.36 --> 4464.48
said in the Bible even if it wasn't by

4463.159 --> 4466.639999999999
Jesus

4464.48 --> 4469.699
but when it comes to

4466.64 --> 4472.46
the ultimate Foundation

4469.699 --> 4475.94
of what is true and what is not true

4472.46 --> 4478.64
what is logical I really only look to

4475.94 --> 4482.12
Christ's words I really do

4478.64 --> 4484.6990000000005
because there's so much said in the

4482.12 --> 4486.62
Bible you could just like jumble it

4484.699 --> 4488.299999999999
around and cherry pick whatever you want

4486.62 --> 4491.0
for your argument and it would sort of

4488.3 --> 4493.219
seem to fit yeah

4491.0 --> 4496.699
except

4493.219 --> 4503.5
when you quote Jesus

4496.699 --> 4503.5
because then it does always work

4503.659 --> 4510.139999999999
then you can't really mislead not really

4508.159 --> 4513.0199999999995
because Jesus is so freaking

4510.14 --> 4514.46
straightforward he's so unrelenting

4513.02 --> 4516.34
Direct

4514.46 --> 4518.96
you can't

4516.34 --> 4521.679
misinterpret that

4518.96 --> 4521.679
really

4523.76 --> 4528.14
unless you don't take him serious though

4525.86 --> 4529.759999999999
taking literal and have your own dog my

4528.14 --> 4532.6990000000005
interpretation right and that's the

4529.76 --> 4534.320000000001
universal problem every time

4532.699 --> 4537.32
so

4534.32 --> 4539.54
that's how I approach the Bible it's all

4537.32 --> 4540.98
about Jesus's words and the rest is all

4539.54 --> 4544.28
secondary

4540.98 --> 4546.799999999999
and still very valuable though

4544.28 --> 4548.98
right especially when taken with a Calm

4546.8 --> 4548.9800000000005
Mind

4549.14 --> 4555.46
you can learn a lot from the Bible even

4551.36 --> 4555.46
from parts that aren't Jesus's words

4559.64 --> 4564.56
then we're omitted yeah Leah Brown I

4561.56 --> 4567.1990000000005
totally agree yeah I I don't omit I want

4564.56 --> 4570.1990000000005
all of it I want all those scriptures

4567.199 --> 4573.86
all the scriptures that were written

4570.199 --> 4576.08
by people that literally knew and heard

4573.86 --> 4577.699
out Christ I want all those scriptures

4576.08 --> 4580.04
to be included

4577.699 --> 4582.919999999999
oh but then it doesn't make any sense

4580.04 --> 4584.36
anymore we can't uphold our Dogma then

4582.92 --> 4587.179
because there are certain things that

4584.36 --> 4589.339999999999
would contradict it yeah we know we know

4587.179 --> 4592.179
that's why you omitted it

4589.34 --> 4592.179
foreign

4599.179 --> 4604.58
like for example Jesus talking about

4601.159 --> 4607.639999999999
reincarnation oops oh there goes your

4604.58 --> 4609.5
Dogma yeah he did actually talk about

4607.64 --> 4612.7390000000005
that oh what are you gonna do about it

4609.5 --> 4615.679
oh he was temporarily insane or oh he's

4612.739 --> 4619.459999999999
what's been being lied about no no no

4615.679 --> 4620.4800000000005
no no he did talk about that

4619.46 --> 4623.78
yeah

4620.48 --> 4626.48
so what you're gonna do now priests huh

4623.78 --> 4628.34
I'm gonna keep that in secret from us

4626.48 --> 4632.299999999999
because

4628.34 --> 4635.06
those books are no longer stuck in your

4632.3 --> 4638.3
Vault where nobody will ever know about

4635.06 --> 4641.0
it yeah this is the internet age we find

4638.3 --> 4644.860000000001
out we find out that there were books

4641.0 --> 4644.86
omitted and we can read them now

4647.9 --> 4650.32
together

4652.239 --> 4657.94
yeah keep chanting for us it's all fine

4657.98 --> 4660.919999999999
uh

4659.36 --> 4663.219
all right I'm gonna take a two minute

4660.92 --> 4663.219
break

4665.06 --> 4668.4490000000005
[Music]

4672.79 --> 4676.509
[Music]

4673.39 --> 4676.509
[Applause]

4680.82 --> 4683.88
[Music]

4688.4 --> 4693.739
all right be right back

4690.739 --> 4693.739
foreign

4756.62 --> 4759.46
foreign

4788.08 --> 4792.219
okay what's going on here

4796.18 --> 4799.7390000000005
[Music]

4813.56 --> 4817.46
right so I hope you guys are enjoying

4815.78 --> 4819.11
this conversation might be a little

4817.46 --> 4822.31
tense for some people here

4819.11 --> 4822.3099999999995
[Music]

4822.38 --> 4827.3
especially Chao Yun cap we still has a

4825.14 --> 4828.92
wrench by the way and

4827.3 --> 4831.38
so

4828.92 --> 4833.9800000000005
and I'm fine with her saying it as she

4831.38 --> 4833.9800000000005
thinks it is

4835.34 --> 4841.12
right she's not being

4837.679 --> 4841.12
so funny about it

4841.58 --> 4847.82
but hey I'm my position is very much

4845.84 --> 4850.52
said there's nothing that could come

4847.82 --> 4853.699
from that side of the argument that

4850.52 --> 4857.2390000000005
could ever change my mind ever

4853.699 --> 4861.099999999999
because I completely figured it out what

4857.239 --> 4861.099999999999
that is what that spirit is

4861.26 --> 4865.0
and why it works the way it does

4869.86 --> 4875.42
yeah and I'm not gonna read anything

4872.3 --> 4878.02
right now I'm not getting a book I'm not

4875.42 --> 4881.8
gonna read scripture

4878.02 --> 4881.8
and it's not gonna help

4886.159 --> 4891.199
yeah unless it's a direct quote from

4888.38 --> 4893.56
Jesus then then I'll then you got my

4891.199 --> 4893.5599999999995
attention

4893.719 --> 4897.55
foreign

4894.48 --> 4897.549999999999
[Music]

4909.88 --> 4915.1
because the Bible says it's factual no

4918.26 --> 4924.5
it is factual

4921.199 --> 4928.839999999999
the things that happen in there

4924.5 --> 4928.84
are true as in

4929.48 --> 4934.28
you can figure it out by the methods

4931.58 --> 4936.98
that are applied by Jesus

4934.28 --> 4938.599999999999
that it works he brought a method a

4936.98 --> 4941.5
great

4938.6 --> 4941.5
revelation

4944.719 --> 4951.64
that is true because it works

4948.08 --> 4951.64
if it works it's true

4956.239 --> 4960.82
right and there's a lot of like

4958.1 --> 4964.76
confirmation about events in the Bible

4960.82 --> 4967.4
location based but there's also been in

4964.76 --> 4970.46
my suspicion over rearrangement of some

4967.4 --> 4973.58
things but I one thing I am absolutely

4970.46 --> 4977.7390000000005
certain about is that Jesus's words are

4973.58 --> 4977.739
actually his original words

4978.08 --> 4982.94
and that they pretty much always like

4980.9 --> 4985.639999999999
those are types of work that you could

4982.94 --> 4987.678999999999
literally like make another story put

4985.64 --> 4989.9800000000005
those words in there and it would still

4987.679 --> 4989.9800000000005
work

4992.06 --> 4997.159000000001
you could put those words in anything

4994.219 --> 5000.52
and it would still work

4997.159 --> 5003.879999999999
that's the whole Magic of Christ

5000.52 --> 5006.820000000001
like it doesn't matter if the book isn't

5003.88 --> 5009.28
exactly perfectly historically honest

5006.82 --> 5011.199
about every single detail

5009.28 --> 5014.259999999999
it doesn't matter

5011.199 --> 5016.86
because the words still work they're

5014.26 --> 5016.860000000001
still true

5017.5 --> 5023.94
Jesus's words not other what other

5020.56 --> 5023.9400000000005
people have to say about it

5036.219 --> 5041.08
Jesus couldn't have been misquoted or if

5038.98 --> 5044.139999999999
it would have been misquoted then you

5041.08 --> 5046.54
would see it because the energy would be

5044.14 --> 5048.280000000001
inconsistent it would be broken

5046.54 --> 5052.36
it wouldn't work

5048.28 --> 5055.12
yeah the power of Jesus's words is not

5052.36 --> 5057.88
a consecutive set of texts it's the

5055.12 --> 5061.179
meaning is the esoteric power of

5057.88 --> 5064.179
everything that he says

5061.179 --> 5066.64
and you can't misquote esoterics because

5064.179 --> 5069.4
if you misquote esoterics

5066.64 --> 5072.159000000001
it loses its power and you will

5069.4 --> 5073.659
recognize it like there's something off

5072.159 --> 5074.98
about this

5073.659 --> 5078.0599999999995
you see

5074.98 --> 5078.0599999999995
[Music]

5078.699 --> 5082.169
foreign

5079.09 --> 5082.169
[Music]

5085.02 --> 5090.159000000001
yeah thank you for your threats yeah

5088.0 --> 5093.76
yeah

5090.159 --> 5096.699
no thanks yeah

5093.76 --> 5099.96
it's about figuring out the truth not

5096.699 --> 5104.5
about subduing yourself due to threats

5099.96 --> 5107.8
of some claim to be entity

5104.5 --> 5110.62
that would do that yeah

5107.8 --> 5113.9800000000005
I don't believe in those entities

5110.62 --> 5115.0
that would do that I believe in the

5113.98 --> 5118.299999999999
truth

5115.0 --> 5121.239
and then that God is all about the truth

5118.3 --> 5123.04
all about specifically that

5121.239 --> 5125.58
right

5123.04 --> 5129.159
and so is a lot of what Jesus does

5125.58 --> 5131.8
specifically about that like friction

5129.159 --> 5134.759999999999
nobody likes the truth you see nobody

5131.8 --> 5134.76
actually likes it

5136.3 --> 5142.06
oh you like the truth when it's somebody

5139.6 --> 5144.52
else and you can all look point out how

5142.06 --> 5145.42
not oh look at the lies there oh it's so

5144.52 --> 5148.6
wrong

5145.42 --> 5151.659
yeah oh but oh you do it too a little

5148.6 --> 5154.360000000001
bit when somebody then says or exposes

5151.659 --> 5157.9
that you're not gonna like it now are

5154.36 --> 5160.719
you yeah yeah that's God

5157.9 --> 5164.44
God is the truth everywhere in

5160.719 --> 5166.679
everything and people tend to not like

5164.44 --> 5166.678999999999
it

5168.46 --> 5174.699
true man of God is in constant conflict

5172.42 --> 5177.82
because people

5174.699 --> 5181.299999999999
are gonna go nuts over him

5177.82 --> 5183.58
because he's exposing the demons that

5181.3 --> 5185.679
they keep hidden inside them

5183.58 --> 5188.92
that's what that does that's what the

5185.679 --> 5192.34
truth does it exposes the demon in

5188.92 --> 5195.36
somebody that they're hiding from

5192.34 --> 5195.360000000001
the lies

5199.39 --> 5202.4890000000005
[Music]

5205.239 --> 5208.239
okay

5209.219 --> 5214.38
all right so you can style water sure uh

5214.96 --> 5223.92
nope saved my trusting in advancement

5218.8 --> 5223.92
saved who's talking about saved

5225.52 --> 5231.639
you care about that I don't give a [ __ ]

5227.739 --> 5236.919999999999
about that I'm not afraid to be

5231.639 --> 5239.86
saved not saved I don't believe in that

5236.92 --> 5243.76
I believe that if you follow the methods

5239.86 --> 5246.159
that is the saving

5243.76 --> 5250.4800000000005
that is what saved you you know why

5246.159 --> 5255.339999999999
because it's a practical Guide to Life

5250.48 --> 5257.08
based on how it works that is what saves

5255.34 --> 5260.08
you

5257.08 --> 5263.44
that's what keeps you away from the

5260.08 --> 5266.0199999999995
Earthly demonic influences that is what

5263.44 --> 5269.0199999999995
saves you not a riddle

5266.02 --> 5272.159000000001
not things people have said

5269.02 --> 5272.159000000001
it's what they do

5278.38 --> 5285.159000000001
what's your purpose here yeah

5282.58 --> 5288.58
yeah what's the purpose here yeah yeah

5285.159 --> 5291.28
it's a good question isn't it huh huh

5288.58 --> 5294.88
guess what it's a question

5291.28 --> 5297.82
only you can answer for yourself

5294.88 --> 5302.139
because there is no cookie cutter

5297.82 --> 5305.32
purpose out there for you to take a bite

5302.139 --> 5307.36
off and they're like oh that's it

5305.32 --> 5309.4
guess what guess who gave you that

5307.36 --> 5312.94
cookie the devil

5309.4 --> 5314.5
because you're not supposed to have a

5312.94 --> 5316.78
cookie cutter

5314.5 --> 5319.179
purpose like that you're supposed to

5316.78 --> 5321.5199999999995
figure it out that's part of the entire

5319.179 --> 5324.159
point of it all

5321.52 --> 5326.1990000000005
yeah the purpose is

5324.159 --> 5327.879999999999
you're here in this life

5326.199 --> 5329.98
you got to do something with your life

5327.88 --> 5333.159000000001
so what are you gonna do

5329.98 --> 5335.678999999999
well guess what I like the maneuver my

5333.159 --> 5339.159
actions more towards Christ

5335.679 --> 5342.04
because I know that will reward me will

5339.159 --> 5345.28
make me happier and potentially give me

5342.04 --> 5347.199
shot a better shot at whatever happens

5345.28 --> 5350.38
after life

5347.199 --> 5354.04
which nobody is a hundred percent

5350.38 --> 5356.1990000000005
certain about and anybody that is must

5354.04 --> 5358.54
be lying

5356.199 --> 5360.879999999999
or they just really are convinced that

5358.54 --> 5362.44
they can't know because you can't nobody

5360.88 --> 5365.26
actually knows

5362.44 --> 5369.099999999999
what happens if there is a continuation

5365.26 --> 5372.400000000001
and I I believe there is a continuation

5369.1 --> 5375.159000000001
I believe it I have no evidence no

5372.4 --> 5379.839999999999
actual evidence and oh my God have I

5375.159 --> 5382.12
done some digging okay digging literally

5379.84 --> 5384.6990000000005
inside myself he had dark World Vision

5382.12 --> 5387.28
big time

5384.699 --> 5389.44
or most of it was to figure out the

5387.28 --> 5392.62
purpose of life in general

5389.44 --> 5393.58
and it was extremely frustrating in that

5392.62 --> 5395.38
sense

5393.58 --> 5398.62
because

5395.38 --> 5401.8
I didn't really find it

5398.62 --> 5403.84
yeah well what I did find is a whole

5401.8 --> 5405.58
bunch of knowledge and a whole bunch of

5403.84 --> 5407.92
wisdom

5405.58 --> 5409.6
that I could process out of that

5407.92 --> 5413.26
knowledge

5409.6 --> 5414.6990000000005
and it all pushed me towards the logical

5413.26 --> 5417.58
conclusion

5414.699 --> 5420.82
I have to follow the path to Christ it's

5417.58 --> 5423.719
the only way I can get out of this and

5420.82 --> 5423.719
remain intact

5424.659 --> 5429.46
even within my lifetime yeah it's not

5427.9 --> 5431.44
even talking about the after it's about

5429.46 --> 5433.719
in my lifetime it's the only way I'm

5431.44 --> 5436.239
going to be intact

5433.719 --> 5438.76
a cohesive person

5436.239 --> 5442.12
for however much you could call me

5438.76 --> 5444.46
cohesive I mean do have weird sort of

5442.12 --> 5447.699
multiple personality traits at times

5444.46 --> 5450.639
right but I mean I'm still cohesive as a

5447.699 --> 5453.28
person as a spirit yeah that's thanks to

5450.639 --> 5455.400000000001
Christ and I learned that the hard way

5453.28 --> 5458.679
in the sense

5455.4 --> 5460.96
that's what I do that's what it's for

5458.679 --> 5463.3
it's for your life to make your life

5460.96 --> 5465.28
better and the life around everybody you

5463.3 --> 5468.1
know better

5465.28 --> 5470.679
I'm not doing it because I'm afraid of

5468.1 --> 5474.400000000001
what happens after death

5470.679 --> 5477.28
because I actually trust God

5474.4 --> 5480.699
I trust God that whatever happens is the

5477.28 --> 5484.42
right thing either I discontinue

5480.699 --> 5487.239
or I continue whatever the design will

5484.42 --> 5490.3
turn out to be and if I discontinue then

5487.239 --> 5491.5599999999995
I'm certain that God will make me be

5490.3 --> 5493.900000000001
okay

5491.56 --> 5496.360000000001
with this continuing that I will feel

5493.9 --> 5499.659
fulfilled and able to discontinue

5496.36 --> 5502.9
existing I trust God yeah that's how

5499.659 --> 5504.94
much I trust God I trust God enough to

5502.9 --> 5507.94
decide for me whether and after life

5504.94 --> 5510.219
exists or not and I will not be dictated

5507.94 --> 5513.239
by other people

5510.219 --> 5513.2390000000005
about that

5513.75 --> 5517.56
[Music]

5521.64 --> 5526.62
[Music]

5523.78 --> 5526.62
you know

5528.34 --> 5533.4400000000005
right anyway

5531.28 --> 5535.42
it's kind of an intense show I hope you

5533.44 --> 5537.5199999999995
guys are appreciating it and anybody

5535.42 --> 5539.86
watching

5537.52 --> 5542.679
and yeah Chow you and cat is not taking

5539.86 --> 5544.9
this too hard I mean me being loud and

5542.679 --> 5547.54
intense it's not necessarily meant for

5544.9 --> 5549.04
you personally it's in general just so

5547.54 --> 5550.42
you know I do appreciate you Charlie

5549.04 --> 5551.5
young cat you're a very nice person

5550.42 --> 5553.6
actually

5551.5 --> 5554.86
so I hope you're not hurt by what I'm

5553.6 --> 5558.219
saying

5554.86 --> 5561.219
but I don't need your concerns about my

5558.219 --> 5564.4800000000005
soul being saved either

5561.219 --> 5564.4800000000005
I can handle this

5565.659 --> 5571.5599999999995
with the help of God

5568.0 --> 5571.56
and the methods of Christ

5576.88 --> 5579.659000000001
all right good

5579.94 --> 5583.15
[Music]

5594.699 --> 5600.879999999999
this is the title I'm not a name yeah

5597.82 --> 5603.82
sure sure he is there's a lot of weird

5600.88 --> 5605.9800000000005
complications even with that all I mean

5603.82 --> 5607.78
there's a likelihood and now we're

5605.98 --> 5609.28
getting like really extra biblical

5607.78 --> 5611.86
there's a likelihood that there wasn't

5609.28 --> 5613.659
even just one Jesus this there could

5611.86 --> 5617.92
have been two

5613.659 --> 5620.44
and dude like the alternative story

5617.92 --> 5622.6
which I get a lot of it through Adam

5620.44 --> 5625.0
Beacon who does some real wide study and

5622.6 --> 5627.46
he's much better at actually figuring it

5625.0 --> 5630.82
out and finding the right texts and all

5627.46 --> 5634.3
that than I am very much better at it he

5630.82 --> 5637.54
really is much more scholarly than I am

5634.3 --> 5642.179
and that results in a completely

5637.54 --> 5642.179
different picture but weird

5642.76 --> 5649.06
with the teachings and the way he is it

5646.6 --> 5652.2390000000005
actually all makes a lot more sense to

5649.06 --> 5652.2390000000005
me logically

5653.44 --> 5657.5199999999995
right and I don't even know the full

5655.6 --> 5660.04
picture of it

5657.52 --> 5662.7390000000005
because I mean the Bible is a very

5660.04 --> 5665.82
elaborate story well what who Jesus

5662.739 --> 5671.0199999999995
really was and what all happened

5665.82 --> 5673.12
is quite complicated in a sense

5671.02 --> 5674.9800000000005
especially when you consider that it was

5673.12 --> 5677.32
probably two people

5674.98 --> 5681.159
like two people that were very much

5677.32 --> 5684.28
teamed up they were like the team

5681.159 --> 5686.92
like they were together like

5684.28 --> 5690.639
incredibly powerful

5686.92 --> 5693.219
one was a a philosopher orator who

5690.639 --> 5696.42
basically figured out the path and the

5693.219 --> 5696.42
other was the Healer

5696.639 --> 5701.1
who did actual Miracle healings

5701.679 --> 5708.659
that's yeah there's alternative theories

5705.1 --> 5708.659000000001
about that for a while now and

5709.719 --> 5717.4
I know working on it but in the meantime

5713.44 --> 5719.86
I will still trust Jesus Christ's words

5717.4 --> 5722.5
in the Bible

5719.86 --> 5725.92
because they are just true

5722.5 --> 5728.199
doesn't matter if the book is is like a

5725.92 --> 5730.179
rearranged theatrical piece in that

5728.199 --> 5733.0
sense it doesn't matter to me it

5730.179 --> 5735.76
literally does not matter because Jesus

5733.0 --> 5738.719
Christ's words work

5735.76 --> 5738.719
they work

5742.96 --> 5747.1
you're going to need to send me that

5744.639 --> 5748.4800000000005
right it's it's actually like a Dutch

5747.1 --> 5750.159000000001
book

5748.48 --> 5751.718999999999
but I don't know what to think about

5750.159 --> 5753.94
that by the way

5751.719 --> 5755.32
it's it's the Dutch writer that wrote

5753.94 --> 5757.259999999999
that book it's actually funny because

5755.32 --> 5760.0
this Christmas

5757.26 --> 5762.6990000000005
my stepmother actually mentioned it to

5760.0 --> 5765.1
me because she is very much on to that

5762.699 --> 5767.199
train of thinking

5765.1 --> 5768.820000000001
I don't remember what that's called that

5767.199 --> 5771.78
book

5768.82 --> 5771.78
uh

5772.6 --> 5779.04
maybe it was like the promise

5776.5 --> 5779.04
no

5780.52 --> 5784.320000000001
not the movie anyway

5792.94 --> 5795.96
I'm not sure

5796.239 --> 5801.4
I don't remember what it's called damn

5798.76 --> 5803.5
it I'll have to ask my stepmother again

5801.4 --> 5805.96
like what book was that again

5803.5 --> 5808.48
like I can't remember it right now sorry

5805.96 --> 5810.88
about that I'll I'll get back to you

5808.48 --> 5812.138999999999
about that but it's a book written by a

5810.88 --> 5814.179
Dutch

5812.139 --> 5816.6990000000005
philosopher or something

5814.179 --> 5818.62
and it was met with a lot of like oh

5816.699 --> 5820.659
he's trying to undermine the Bible of

5818.62 --> 5822.58
course

5820.659 --> 5824.92
and I think it was written somewhere in

5822.58 --> 5827.62
the 90s

5824.92 --> 5830.76
but I don't remember the name of it I

5827.62 --> 5830.76
will get back to you with that

5843.04 --> 5848.26
we are all in some form of communion

5846.159 --> 5850.92
what

5848.26 --> 5850.92
okay

5858.36 --> 5866.32
deity oh look even the word deities

5862.9 --> 5869.92
aptapi is already a form of idolatry I

5866.32 --> 5874.659
mean I don't believe God is a deity God

5869.92 --> 5877.179
is not a figure yeah to say God is a

5874.659 --> 5880.48
figure in Earth in the earth realm is

5877.179 --> 5883.92
already idolatry and that is basically

5880.48 --> 5883.919999999999
what a deity stands for

5884.62 --> 5892.139
what the word stands for is not

5887.56 --> 5892.139
right it's a a deity

5893.739 --> 5900.099999999999
it's almost automatically implying a

5897.219 --> 5903.699
Pantheon and that isn't God a Pantheon

5900.1 --> 5906.400000000001
is not God that's little G

5903.699 --> 5909.4
or the Elohim if you will

5906.4 --> 5911.08
right physical beings or beings that are

5909.4 --> 5914.159
entities separate

5911.08 --> 5914.159
in this realm

5914.739 --> 5922.12
but that's not God God is Not like a

5919.96 --> 5924.88
physical being

5922.12 --> 5927.82
or even a separated spirit that is in

5924.88 --> 5930.76
the realm he is outside of it oh and he

5927.82 --> 5932.44
is all he is the designer of all and he

5930.76 --> 5935.26
has no

5932.44 --> 5937.599999999999
sense of time in that sense like he's

5935.26 --> 5941.08
not bound by time that he's not gonna

5937.6 --> 5944.26
have an avatar there is no Avatar of the

5941.08 --> 5946.239
Creator it doesn't exist there was any

5944.26 --> 5948.9400000000005
kind of Avatar

5946.239 --> 5951.718999999999
it would have been the Elohim at the

5948.94 --> 5951.719
start of creation

5953.62 --> 5960.12
and I suspect that the Abrahim

5955.54 --> 5960.12
eventually turned into the pantheon

5961.42 --> 5967.0
but that they were basically because

5964.12 --> 5968.739
they are separated beings right and if

5967.0 --> 5970.3
you're a separated being you're not

5968.739 --> 5973.599999999999
going to be a god

5970.3 --> 5976.0
you might be extremely powerful

5973.6 --> 5978.639
but you're gonna be separated in spirit

5976.0 --> 5981.4
and so the Earthly will start to take

5978.639 --> 5984.219
root it just happens it happens to all

5981.4 --> 5987.099999999999
those things that manifest here

5984.219 --> 5988.36
right so anything being thrown down in

5987.1 --> 5991.3
this realm

5988.36 --> 5994.42
even to shape it is gonna be influenced

5991.3 --> 5997.96
by what is here

5994.42 --> 5999.65
and the dark spirits that seem to

5997.96 --> 6002.82
be part of this realm too

5999.65 --> 6002.82
[Music]

6012.179 --> 6018.0
God is spiritual if you say God is

6014.88 --> 6020.6990000000005
Spirit then I'd say well technically

6018.0 --> 6024.179
that's not too far off probably because

6020.699 --> 6027.9
God is the akashic library

6024.179 --> 6030.42
God is information itself like that's

6027.9 --> 6031.5599999999995
his realm that's the thing that isn't

6030.42 --> 6033.84
physical

6031.56 --> 6036.4400000000005
It's Supernatural literally in the

6033.84 --> 6041.219
physics sense it's supernatural and thus

6036.44 --> 6043.44
that's God's active domain

6041.219 --> 6045.54
I think that that is what he is acting

6043.44 --> 6047.219
what Book Creator designer that is

6045.54 --> 6049.56
outside of the realm is still actually

6047.219 --> 6052.5
doing he's still

6049.56 --> 6056.84
the pre-designer and arbiter of

6052.5 --> 6056.84
information and like who gets ideas

6061.139 --> 6067.56
that sort of thing although maybe he's

6063.54 --> 6070.62
even designated an angel or like a

6067.56 --> 6074.46
an Elohim to that even

6070.62 --> 6076.38
something or no getting kind of mixed up

6074.46 --> 6077.699
with the terminologies here

6076.38 --> 6079.56
but

6077.699 --> 6082.08
yeah

6079.56 --> 6084.06
God is a spirit I mean through our

6082.08 --> 6087.36
spirit we can

6084.06 --> 6090.659000000001
understand and potentially even interact

6087.36 --> 6093.0
with God but like how do you know that

6090.659 --> 6095.659
he would

6093.0 --> 6099.239
like I trust

6095.659 --> 6102.36
Angels more than I would anything that

6099.239 --> 6104.459999999999
would claim to be God

6102.36 --> 6107.759999999999
yeah

6104.46 --> 6109.619
because an angel is is just an angel is

6107.76 --> 6112.860000000001
the task they do

6109.619 --> 6115.32
that's all they can do they just do what

6112.86 --> 6119.179
they were designated to do

6115.32 --> 6119.179
they would never claim to be God

6120.9 --> 6125.219
you can trust that

6122.76 --> 6129.7390000000005
because they're doing that if something

6125.219 --> 6129.7390000000005
comes to you and says they're God

6129.78 --> 6135.239
then

6132.0 --> 6137.219
to me that's almost automatically a lie

6135.239 --> 6140.879999999999
and it's kind of weird that way because

6137.219 --> 6143.159
I literally experienced that in my Dark

6140.88 --> 6148.02
World Vision at the very start

6143.159 --> 6151.679
a figure came at me and said I am God

6148.02 --> 6153.540000000001
let me demonstrate how I am God

6151.679 --> 6156.06
and I didn't believe him

6153.54 --> 6158.28
but eventually I got so weirded out

6156.06 --> 6159.84
through the entire gigantic experience

6158.28 --> 6163.38
that lasted like

6159.84 --> 6165.54
virtually 80 years that I eventually

6163.38 --> 6166.32
started to kind of believe that he might

6165.54 --> 6170.639
be

6166.32 --> 6173.04
but then later again figured out like no

6170.639 --> 6175.7390000000005
something odd like everything I was just

6173.04 --> 6177.239
weirded out by everything eventually

6175.739 --> 6179.5199999999995
right but

6177.239 --> 6183.419999999999
if something comes to you and says you

6179.52 --> 6185.639
I'm God they're lying it's almost like

6183.42 --> 6188.6
automatic

6185.639 --> 6188.6
foreign

6190.5 --> 6196.44
if it is an entity

6193.38 --> 6198.179
but if it is just meaning itself if an

6196.44 --> 6200.04
idea comes to you and you understand

6198.179 --> 6202.619
something you understand a greater

6200.04 --> 6207.54
Insight like Jesus understood the

6202.619 --> 6210.659
Magnificent Insight of diplomacy and

6207.54 --> 6213.86
how to deal with sin and how to bring

6210.659 --> 6213.86
out the good in people

6214.08 --> 6221.36
that is God why is it God because it is

6218.52 --> 6221.360000000001
the truth

6222.119 --> 6229.799999999999
if I had ideas like that that came to me

6225.719 --> 6232.32
I wouldn't have to have that idea or a

6229.8 --> 6236.52
voice or whatever tell me hey by the way

6232.32 --> 6240.139
I'm God I wouldn't need that because it

6236.52 --> 6240.139
is the truth

6241.26 --> 6247.1990000000005
it works it's magnificent it's a

6244.199 --> 6249.54
brilliant idea it works I don't need

6247.199 --> 6251.58
some voice telling me oh yeah by the way

6249.54 --> 6253.679
this is from God I don't need that

6251.58 --> 6254.88
because it's self-evident because it's

6253.679 --> 6256.31
true

6254.88 --> 6263.999
foreign

6256.31 --> 6263.999000000001
[Music]

6269.39 --> 6272.52
[Music]

6272.82 --> 6276.78
and in that sense I've had moments even

6274.86 --> 6279.48
that were like very esoteric where I

6276.78 --> 6282.42
would be like somebody had a brilliant

6279.48 --> 6284.879999999999
Insight very enlightened and I would

6282.42 --> 6286.9800000000005
like see God in them it's like wow

6284.88 --> 6290.52
that's God that just spoke through you

6286.98 --> 6292.5
and they sometimes be like yeah it kind

6290.52 --> 6294.4800000000005
of felt like that

6292.5 --> 6297.78
right

6294.48 --> 6299.82
they didn't need a voice telling them oh

6297.78 --> 6302.78
yeah by the way this is God speaking not

6299.82 --> 6306.239
just it just happens somebody's just

6302.78 --> 6308.159
brilliant inside they just roll it out I

6306.239 --> 6310.32
mean that is of god

6308.159 --> 6314.58
that is what I believe that is God

6310.32 --> 6317.46
energy doing that in that moment

6314.58 --> 6321.32
a brilliant Insight a clarity

6317.46 --> 6321.32
a peacefulness that comes with it

6322.92 --> 6327.179
but it's not continuous just

6325.619 --> 6330.119
a gift

6327.179 --> 6333.179
just a gift given to you in that moment

6330.119 --> 6337.0199999999995
with all the energy that comes with it

6333.179 --> 6340.4400000000005
and then you can choose to do what it

6337.02 --> 6345.0
whatever you choose you can

6340.44 --> 6347.04
keep it and try to manifest it make it a

6345.0 --> 6349.26
physical reality or you can just keep it

6347.04 --> 6351.239
to yourself and just keep it in the back

6349.26 --> 6353.1
of your mind and not manifest it as much

6351.239 --> 6355.138999999999
it's up to you

6353.1 --> 6357.780000000001
but I do believe in those moments that

6355.139 --> 6360.84
is God because I think that God is the

6357.78 --> 6365.48
Arbiter of all information and ideas we

6360.84 --> 6365.4800000000005
literally get good ideas from God

6366.96 --> 6373.5
and if you become really corrupted and

6370.199 --> 6376.619
dwelling in dark things then you get

6373.5 --> 6378.54
ideas well that are attuned to those

6376.619 --> 6380.339999999999
frequency and you might even say that

6378.54 --> 6382.5
those ideas are from God too they're

6380.34 --> 6386.58
just ideas that punish you even more

6382.5 --> 6388.76
right so I think that all ideas come

6386.58 --> 6392.699
from God all of it

6388.76 --> 6394.320000000001
including the evil ones why because then

6392.699 --> 6396.96
it's a punishment

6394.32 --> 6399.9
that's what I think

6396.96 --> 6402.78
yeah you dealing evil you get evil ideas

6399.9 --> 6404.159
you get evil feelings and the part the

6402.78 --> 6406.44
torture and the punishment that comes

6404.159 --> 6409.0199999999995
with it you do your best you do good

6406.44 --> 6412.0199999999995
then you get the good ideas

6409.02 --> 6414.4800000000005
and a good feeling

6412.02 --> 6415.92
and love from everybody

6414.48 --> 6418.5599999999995
see

6415.92 --> 6419.6990000000005
that's how I see it

6418.56 --> 6423.719
right

6419.699 --> 6427.5
but man this show has certainly

6423.719 --> 6429.84

6432.78 --> 6437.599999999999
