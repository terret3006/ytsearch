cloudy still a bit of bright sky in

134.959 --> 138.56

188.48 --> 196.07999999999998
so still my back is still

192.239 --> 196.879
well sore at least i seem to be a little

196.08 --> 200.31900000000002
less stiff

196.879 --> 201.51899999999998
but yeah the muscles are just really

200.319 --> 204.23899999999998
sore and they're still

201.519 --> 204.239
recovering

209.519 --> 214.799
and yeah i didn't go to bed late but

212.72 --> 219.92
still just had trouble

214.799 --> 219.92000000000002
sleeping overall it's weird

221.519 --> 229.44
but yeah i'm surviving it

226.72 --> 230.72
uh yeah i was pretty up pretty early

229.44 --> 234.07999999999998
today

230.72 --> 239.04
and i got into the flat earth arena

234.08 --> 241.28
hung around there for like over an hour

239.04 --> 242.959
and chocolate was in there and nathan

241.28 --> 245.84
thompson and

242.959 --> 247.439
which it gets it and others and kosho

245.84 --> 249.12
was there in there too and i think

247.439 --> 250.64
another baller i'm not too sure

249.12 --> 254.48000000000002
at least kosher was there and it was

250.64 --> 256.959
yeah pretty great hangout

254.48 --> 256.959
and uh

257.68 --> 263.04
yeah it was something different it's

259.44 --> 263.04
more flexible group like that

263.919 --> 266.88
it was kind of fun

267.36 --> 271.91900000000004
uh yeah as for yesterday

273.68 --> 280.40000000000003
early bird show yeah i was good

277.04 --> 283.199
then big bear also went live and he

280.4 --> 284.63899999999995
started to yeah he showed the book of

283.199 --> 287.68
ira

284.639 --> 290.08
so somebody dropped that in chat

287.68 --> 292.16
and i think i completely forgot about

290.08 --> 294.88
that because it's not the first time

292.16 --> 297.84000000000003
but yeah the book of ira that video holy

294.88 --> 301.68
[ __ ]

297.84 --> 305.039
that that that thing is so amazing

301.68 --> 306.88
amazingly hilarious just

305.039 --> 311.84
can't stop laughing every time i see it

306.88 --> 311.84
it's it's iconic

312.0 --> 316.56
so yeah book of ira pretty pretty damn

314.8 --> 319.28000000000003
funny

316.56 --> 321.039
i also realized like yeah why is it so

319.28 --> 324.32
funny because

321.039 --> 326.88
most of us guys or many of

324.32 --> 328.639
people that are like like us like the

326.88 --> 332.639
bears

328.639 --> 336.08
inside of them they have like the inner

332.639 --> 336.479
struggle which is which i think is just

336.08 --> 339.039
very

336.479 --> 340.56
much like that setting it's like christ

339.039 --> 343.759
on one side

340.56 --> 346.08
and ira on the other and they're just

343.759 --> 347.039
constantly trying to find this balance

346.08 --> 350.56
and

347.039 --> 353.039
ira always yeah always doubles down

350.56 --> 355.12
and christ always tries to be patient

353.039 --> 355.59999999999997
and just tries to stop it from happening

355.12 --> 358.479
it

355.6 --> 358.47900000000004
it's brilliant

359.039 --> 363.52
you sent that to me oh right yeah yeah

361.84 --> 364.79999999999995
good service you did send it to me but

363.52 --> 367.039
the youtube video

364.8 --> 369.28000000000003
the original it it got removed very

367.039 --> 373.12
quickly

369.28 --> 375.35999999999996
but own benjamin had it stored somewhere

373.12 --> 377.039
so yeah you sent that to me but i didn't

375.36 --> 379.12
see it from that video i just saw it

377.039 --> 382.8
because it was streamed again

379.12 --> 382.8
it's really freaking funny

385.44 --> 388.56
hey you can't help that good servant hey

388.0 --> 390.72
i bet

388.56 --> 395.36
that when you were sharing it it wasn't

390.72 --> 398.88000000000005
blocked yet so

395.36 --> 403.759
but yeah amazing stuff

398.88 --> 403.759
uh the rest of the day i don't know

404.08 --> 407.199
i'm i'm kind of not doing a lot of

406.479 --> 409.199
things

407.199 --> 410.56
hanging in there because this back

409.199 --> 413.91900000000004
problem is just re

410.56 --> 417.52
literally dragging me down it's very

413.919 --> 417.52
tiresome it's weird because

419.12 --> 422.319
every time i try to really focus on

420.96 --> 426.0
doing something

422.319 --> 427.36
like this tiredness slowly starts to

426.0 --> 430.4
build up and if i didn't

427.36 --> 432.08000000000004
just like i don't know even if i go to

430.4 --> 432.63899999999995
the toilet or get something to drink

432.08 --> 434.56
it's like

432.639 --> 436.0
stand up and suddenly like that tire

434.56 --> 439.52
just like hits me it's very

436.0 --> 441.68
annoying so it is recovery

439.52 --> 442.96
this feels very similar to just

441.68 --> 446.319
recovering from

442.96 --> 448.479
being sick except

446.319 --> 451.03900000000004
instead of like typically being like a

448.479 --> 454.4
coal or something or a flu

451.039 --> 454.4
it's just my back

455.759 --> 458.96000000000004
my back got a cold sore muscle i think

458.479 --> 462.31899999999996
it

458.96 --> 464.4
it it happened like that too because it

462.319 --> 466.96000000000004
was a really hot night i slept

464.4 --> 470.0
basically without covers and then it got

466.96 --> 475.12
cold while i was sleeping

470.0 --> 475.12
so i got too cold i think that's how it

476.84 --> 484.08
happened

479.199 --> 484.08000000000004
ah anyways

485.039 --> 491.759
usually i'm very careful with that stuff

488.96 --> 493.52
i i take care of my back very well very

491.759 --> 494.96000000000004
aware of it because i've had a lot of

493.52 --> 499.28
back problems

494.96 --> 500.96
because i wasn't careful because i just

499.28 --> 503.19899999999996
think sometimes especially when i get

500.96 --> 504.96
very active i just think like i'm as

503.199 --> 508.96000000000004
flexible as a cat

504.96 --> 512.0799999999999
and it might be like that a little

508.96 --> 514.399
but then afterward it's not

512.08 --> 516.64
and if you then just overdo things

514.399 --> 518.719
forget over enthusiastic over stretchy

516.64 --> 521.8389999999999
then i pay the price afterwards

518.719 --> 521.839
and i learned about that

522.8 --> 527.519
so i was paying attention to the borders

526.399 --> 530.24
of

527.519 --> 532.72
yeah the limits of my body and realized

530.24 --> 535.279
that i am slowly getting older

532.72 --> 538.64
even though i'm taking good care of

535.279 --> 540.32
myself i guess for somebody

538.64 --> 542.16
well compared to 20 years ago i'm

540.32 --> 543.0400000000001
absolutely taking better care of myself

542.16 --> 546.24
it's not going to be

543.04 --> 548.64
slow yeah it's not going to be a quick

546.24 --> 549.44
degeneration but it's still i have it's

548.64 --> 552.08
always

549.44 --> 554.48
slightly going down i have to keep that

552.08 --> 554.48
in mind

554.88 --> 559.12
i realized that even like 20 years ago

557.2 --> 562.399
but then i was just too

559.12 --> 565.12
caught up too seduced by all the

562.399 --> 565.12
the joys

565.6 --> 568.24
of the world

569.279 --> 579.04
the joys like yeah just i don't know

576.959 --> 580.7199999999999
what yeah what teenagers have is just

579.04 --> 583.12
the

580.72 --> 585.2
i don't know the energy rewards are were

583.12 --> 586.9590000000001
overwhelming to me so even though you

585.2 --> 591.12
figure out certain things you just can't

586.959 --> 592.2399999999999
resist it i had a lot of trouble with

591.12 --> 595.6
that when i was young and

592.24 --> 596.64
also the reason i was very i was aware

595.6 --> 598.88
of that

596.64 --> 601.36
pretty early on still had to deal with

598.88 --> 605.12
it but because of that it's also that i

601.36 --> 608.5600000000001
i've not really tried a lot of drugs or

605.12 --> 608.5600000000001
barely barely any

609.519 --> 612.9590000000001
because i knew like [ __ ] if i'm gonna

612.079 --> 615.1999999999999
find something

612.959 --> 616.64
in there that that's just gonna be

615.2 --> 619.0400000000001
amazing

616.64 --> 620.48
like i knew that like if a drug out

619.04 --> 623.1999999999999
there that i would take

620.48 --> 626.0
would be too good it would screw me up i

623.2 --> 627.6800000000001
was aware of that

626.0 --> 630.16
and i kind of figured it out even

627.68 --> 631.519
through cannabis because cannabis

630.16 --> 633.36
even though considered one of the

631.519 --> 636.64
lighter drugs i guess

633.36 --> 637.6
it already kind of did that it it

636.64 --> 641.6
noticeably

637.6 --> 644.839
altered just the way

641.6 --> 646.0790000000001
i experienced myself even when i wasn't

644.839 --> 648.1600000000001
smoking

646.079 --> 649.92
so yeah because of that it's just like

648.16 --> 651.8389999999999
oh [ __ ] drugs man you got to be

649.92 --> 654.16
extremely careful and people out there

651.839 --> 657.0400000000001
i've seen that it was just like oh yeah

654.16 --> 660.0
whatever give it to me and i would be

657.04 --> 663.92
like oh my god

660.0 --> 663.92
they have no idea what they're doing

665.6 --> 670.0790000000001
right when at the same time and this is

668.0 --> 672.88
like a bit conflicting at the same time

670.079 --> 672.88
i was kind of

673.6 --> 678.48
showing sort of an image this was my

675.839 --> 679.6
base on my personal social insecurity as

678.48 --> 681.519
a teenager and like

679.6 --> 682.9590000000001
what stunts do i take towards the public

681.519 --> 685.519
with everything that i am and

682.959 --> 687.1999999999999
being sort of a reject rejection as well

685.519 --> 688.0
i kind of wanted to be a little bit like

687.2 --> 690.8000000000001
a rebel

688.0 --> 692.48
but rebels always typically do push that

690.8 --> 697.68
sort of thing

692.48 --> 697.6800000000001
and i had to yeah

698.24 --> 702.88
basically try to be a rebel but mentally

700.959 --> 706.3199999999999
and not

702.88 --> 710.0
by just rejecting god even though

706.32 --> 711.36
i wasn't talking i wasn't being pro-god

710.0 --> 714.399
i wasn't being christian or

711.36 --> 716.639
it's confusing

714.399 --> 720.56
there's a rebel within a rebel and then

716.639 --> 720.5600000000001
it's just everything becomes a mess

720.8 --> 724.88
but yeah i did manage to avoid

725.04 --> 731.04
being very experimental with drugs and

727.2 --> 733.44
that includes hallucinogenics as well

731.04 --> 734.399
even though i've always had interest in

733.44 --> 737.36
knowing

734.399 --> 738.0
things about it even like with mushrooms

737.36 --> 740.48
and all that

738.0 --> 742.24
just i've never tried i've known all

740.48 --> 743.9200000000001
kinds of people that have tried all

742.24 --> 745.04
kinds of drugs and then i would hear

743.92 --> 747.279
them out i would

745.04 --> 748.56
like really press them like please tell

747.279 --> 750.16
me

748.56 --> 753.04
exactly what it was like first time

750.16 --> 755.1999999999999
section like i wanna

753.04 --> 756.3199999999999
hear them out and then my spirit can

755.2 --> 758.24
kind of like

756.32 --> 760.639
really get the experience instead of

758.24 --> 761.44
just reading some generic explanation

760.639 --> 763.76
from

761.44 --> 766.9590000000001
from a piece of paper i wanted people's

763.76 --> 766.959
personal spiritual

767.6 --> 772.0
on the spot explanation so they would

770.0 --> 773.839
give more raw data

772.0 --> 775.92
from their own experience besides what

773.839 --> 778.8000000000001
they would cognitively know

775.92 --> 780.16
about it see and that's how i got a lot

778.8 --> 782.8
of my

780.16 --> 782.8
information

783.36 --> 790.0
about drugs

787.12 --> 791.12
and even like yes other situations where

790.0 --> 794.8
people would be

791.12 --> 796.399
on drugs and then just by being in their

794.8 --> 799.1999999999999
presence

796.399 --> 800.079
my spirit would like it would start to

799.2 --> 803.279
resonate i

800.079 --> 804.399
and we with a small group of friends

803.279 --> 806.24
back in the day

804.399 --> 807.44
there were others that were just as

806.24 --> 809.839
sensitive as me and

807.44 --> 812.0790000000001
and we kind of even did weird little

809.839 --> 817.2790000000001
tricks with that

812.079 --> 819.68
like one guy would then get really drunk

817.279 --> 821.6
and the others would basically make

819.68 --> 825.92
themselves drunk

821.6 --> 828.639
without drinking by kind of like

825.92 --> 829.76
letting that effect it's weird it's

828.639 --> 832.16
psychosomatics

829.76 --> 833.199
it is based on it's fascinating how that

832.16 --> 838.0
works

833.199 --> 842.24
but yeah it halfway works with me

838.0 --> 844.639
but i'm not really interested in

842.24 --> 845.6
becoming naturally intoxicated like that

844.639 --> 851.279
i almost

845.6 --> 853.519
try to avoid rushes as much as i can

851.279 --> 855.8389999999999
rushes of feeling because if i would

853.519 --> 857.68
push down on it it would give the gas

855.839 --> 858.1600000000001
with the feelings yeah it's going to

857.68 --> 861.519
just

858.16 --> 862.88
create pull me out of whack make me do

861.519 --> 866.8
things that i'll

862.88 --> 868.8389999999999
regret some of the time

866.8 --> 870.3199999999999
you know there is a time and a place for

868.839 --> 872.8000000000001
everything

870.32 --> 874.24
i always find it very hard to time that

872.8 --> 875.5999999999999
sort of thing right although i've become

874.24 --> 878.48
a lot better at it

875.6 --> 878.48
over time anyway

878.639 --> 886.399
uh yeah that was my piece

882.639 --> 889.92
on drugs better to

886.399 --> 893.12
better to just avoid it better to

889.92 --> 895.279
concern yourselves with nutrition

893.12 --> 896.399
you know if you like a lot of people

895.279 --> 899.199
fall for that

896.399 --> 900.24
silly trick like oh drugs just does

899.199 --> 902.079
something to you

900.24 --> 903.76
really quickly and then we have the

902.079 --> 906.0
experience and then afterwards you think

903.76 --> 906.0
back

906.16 --> 913.76
and it's very easy to get a quick

910.32 --> 917.6
thing happening but

913.76 --> 920.16
if you really want to experience more

917.6 --> 921.6800000000001
from yourself it's better to to learn

920.16 --> 923.8389999999999
how to

921.68 --> 925.76
manage your own nutrition and the better

923.839 --> 927.839
you get it the more oversight you get

925.76 --> 929.04
over how your body works what you really

927.839 --> 932.639
need

929.04 --> 935.68
and how to

932.639 --> 937.279
avoid getting seduced to do things that

935.68 --> 938.8
are bad for you or eat things that are

937.279 --> 942.24
bad for you

938.8 --> 944.4799999999999
and not just based again on the generic

942.24 --> 946.24
what is said to be good or bad no no

944.48 --> 949.12
based on what you figured out how

946.24 --> 950.72
exactly your body works

949.12 --> 952.9590000000001
you gotta kind of be strict with that

950.72 --> 954.639
don't don't be persuaded by other

952.959 --> 959.04
people's

954.639 --> 959.04
pushiness on their personal method

959.12 --> 963.759
right and if you do that

962.16 --> 966.7199999999999
if you're good at that if you get good

963.759 --> 968.8000000000001
at that if you really spend some time

966.72 --> 971.36
to well effectively become your own

968.8 --> 973.7589999999999
nutritionist your own doctor

971.36 --> 975.759
on top of that if you can learn as much

973.759 --> 979.759
as you can

975.759 --> 981.6
be self self reliant but always learning

979.759 --> 984.0790000000001
always learning more always

981.6 --> 984.72
figuring out what is real what is not

984.079 --> 986.8
real was

984.72 --> 988.72
a certain base assumption that is part

986.8 --> 992.0
of the funicular of your own

988.72 --> 995.279
knowledge base has it is it all correct

992.0 --> 998.16
you know i believe for example in a lot

995.279 --> 1000.48
of microbiology concerning viruses like

998.16 --> 1001.68
that story caught on to me became part

1000.48 --> 1004.16
of my mindset and now

1001.68 --> 1006.3199999999999
as time passes more and more seems like

1004.16 --> 1006.3199999999999
it's

1006.72 --> 1013.6
it was all [ __ ]

1011.36 --> 1013.6
and

1015.199 --> 1020.8
yeah reflecting on past experiences

1017.44 --> 1024.16
every time it would always be the fear

1020.8 --> 1026.24
that would do things

1024.16 --> 1028.48
it would never just happen like that you

1026.24 --> 1032.16
know the worst thing that i've ever

1028.48 --> 1036.16
experienced is just like getting

1032.16 --> 1036.16
yeah getting sort of a coughing flu

1036.799 --> 1040.959
pretty quickly after somebody else would

1039.36 --> 1044.4799999999998
but then other times

1040.959 --> 1046.559
very similar scenarios i wouldn't

1044.48 --> 1049.44
i just wouldn't and then i figured out

1046.559 --> 1050.08
like why why that time did it work like

1049.44 --> 1053.52
that

1050.08 --> 1056.48
well maybe because

1053.52 --> 1058.559
i wasn't it was like in the summer again

1056.48 --> 1059.28
sudden rainstorm i wasn't dressed

1058.559 --> 1061.2
properly

1059.28 --> 1062.96
you're like soaked in a t-shirt when

1061.2 --> 1065.52
it's really cold outside

1062.96 --> 1066.24
you don't have anywhere to dry it off

1065.52 --> 1068.72
you like

1066.24 --> 1070.799
be like that for like an hour or more

1068.72 --> 1073.84
yeah you'll get a cold because the

1070.799 --> 1077.28
body's conditions

1073.84 --> 1081.84
were just pushed in the state

1077.28 --> 1081.84
that a reaction becomes necessary

1083.28 --> 1088.08
and then somebody starts to show these

1086.32 --> 1089.76
certain symptoms and it immediately

1088.08 --> 1091.4399999999998
echoes on because your body's like yeah

1089.76 --> 1092.0
yeah that we think that's a good idea

1091.44 --> 1094.16
because

1092.0 --> 1096.88
we've run into this situation here we

1094.16 --> 1096.88
need to fix it

1099.2 --> 1104.4
then you get sick and then goes away

1102.08 --> 1104.3999999999999
again

1106.84 --> 1114.24
so yeah

1109.039 --> 1114.24
anybody else getting in here mandy young

1120.84 --> 1125.36
ajm

1122.16 --> 1128.0
tom c i don't know who that is

1125.36 --> 1128.0
yeah yeah

1129.12 --> 1131.36
so

1132.799 --> 1139.76
let's see what else yeah a good thing

1136.72 --> 1142.08
might be good to basically speak about

1139.76 --> 1143.84
is and big bear addresses this a lot i

1142.08 --> 1145.4399999999998
think he deals with similar issues but

1143.84 --> 1148.3999999999999
he's very sharp on it

1145.44 --> 1148.72
of course he's surrounded by logos so

1148.4 --> 1152.16
that

1148.72 --> 1154.4
makes it easier but yeah the issue with

1152.16 --> 1155.76
the world situation and all the lies in

1154.4 --> 1158.0800000000002
the satanic machine

1155.76 --> 1159.2
and these people everywhere being

1158.08 --> 1160.72
tricked

1159.2 --> 1162.48
and there yeah this is the thing you

1160.72 --> 1164.16
know they're being tricked

1162.48 --> 1165.919
but the people that aren't tricked are

1164.16 --> 1169.3600000000001
still being forced

1165.919 --> 1172.48
sore as much yeah it's very tough not to

1169.36 --> 1174.3999999999999
to be in between all that

1172.48 --> 1177.3600000000001
they have to deal with the stress from

1174.4 --> 1179.2
that so we're still being punished

1177.36 --> 1181.6
and then it's like it does it doesn't

1179.2 --> 1185.28
feel fair

1181.6 --> 1187.6789999999999
and then revenge wrath

1185.28 --> 1189.039
and yeah everybody here knows that i

1187.679 --> 1193.8400000000001
have issues with that

1189.039 --> 1193.84
sometimes pretty damn strong

1194.799 --> 1199.679
and i keep on wondering in my mind like

1197.679 --> 1201.1200000000001
what big bear says no no god will deal

1199.679 --> 1204.159
with it all

1201.12 --> 1208.08
and then i'm like but is

1204.159 --> 1211.5200000000002
is that is that really

1208.08 --> 1214.72
the case or is this a typical

1211.52 --> 1217.9189999999999
example of there's

1214.72 --> 1221.84
remember the story there's a flood

1217.919 --> 1224.72
and yeah farmer staying at his house

1221.84 --> 1225.84
and he gets on the roof and then the

1224.72 --> 1227.679
boat comes

1225.84 --> 1229.28
and he's like no no god will take care

1227.679 --> 1232.48
of it

1229.28 --> 1235.039
and then the flood increases and

1232.48 --> 1235.919
on the chimney and then another boat

1235.039 --> 1237.44
comes

1235.919 --> 1239.6000000000001
and there's no no god will take care of

1237.44 --> 1243.2
me and then

1239.6 --> 1244.6399999999999
yeah he's standing on his tippy toes

1243.2 --> 1246.0800000000002
with his nose right above the water and

1244.64 --> 1249.039
the last boat comes and like

1246.08 --> 1250.6399999999999
dude this is your last chance he's like

1249.039 --> 1251.76
no no god will take care of it and then

1250.64 --> 1255.039
he drowns

1251.76 --> 1258.32
you know is this that because

1255.039 --> 1261.6
does few in a way like drowning

1258.32 --> 1265.6789999999999
you know this gradually building

1261.6 --> 1265.6789999999999
situations stress levels building

1266.159 --> 1270.4
are we supposed to wait for god to take

1268.559 --> 1275.76
care of it and

1270.4 --> 1280.799
or are we actually supposed to

1275.76 --> 1280.799
do that thing it's tough

1282.32 --> 1286.24
are we supposed to really make a move

1284.88 --> 1290.4
actually

1286.24 --> 1294.32
how how would that happen

1290.4 --> 1294.96
or is it well what i can derive from

1294.32 --> 1298.24
owens

1294.96 --> 1299.76
stories is it really just about waiting

1298.24 --> 1303.919
and letting it all collapse

1299.76 --> 1305.12
will it or will it drag so much with it

1303.919 --> 1309.2800000000002
is that

1305.12 --> 1311.84
worth it aren't we all going to be left

1309.28 --> 1311.84
scarred

1314.32 --> 1318.559
you know it's it's tough it's

1316.84 --> 1320.72
conflicting

1318.559 --> 1322.799
now of course literally being motivated

1320.72 --> 1325.44
by wrath is not a good thing that's

1322.799 --> 1328.24
never a good thing

1325.44 --> 1328.64
but yeah the wrath also involves in this

1328.24 --> 1332.559
case

1328.64 --> 1333.919
justice or just wanting it to stop

1332.559 --> 1336.08
wanting to be

1333.919 --> 1336.96
left in peace and being able to do what

1336.08 --> 1340.08
you want to do

1336.96 --> 1342.48
freedom real freedom not from god but

1340.08 --> 1347.84
with god

1342.48 --> 1347.84
and being left alone for it

1350.559 --> 1352.96
anyway

1354.64 --> 1358.0
yeah but how do you know what going

1356.4 --> 1362.0
against god is

1358.0 --> 1364.72
in this case you know if

1362.0 --> 1366.24
if we would if i don't know enough

1364.72 --> 1368.24
people would actually like

1366.24 --> 1371.28
syria like really revolt not just

1368.24 --> 1371.28
protest but like

1371.679 --> 1378.96
basically just organizing

1375.76 --> 1382.72
taking it down like really getting in

1378.96 --> 1385.039
there breaking in if necessary occupying

1382.72 --> 1386.32
arresting the people citizens arrest

1385.039 --> 1388.1589999999999
something

1386.32 --> 1389.6789999999999
i don't know it would have to be plenty

1388.159 --> 1392.7990000000002
of people a part of the

1389.679 --> 1394.72
operation to even get it all right

1392.799 --> 1395.9189999999999
because otherwise it it might just

1394.72 --> 1399.52
become outright

1395.919 --> 1400.7990000000002
unsolvable or yeah unsolvable criminal

1399.52 --> 1402.4
and that's

1400.799 --> 1405.12
you know you need it needs still needs

1402.4 --> 1408.4
to be correct for afterward

1405.12 --> 1410.0
you can't just go completely

1408.4 --> 1412.96
like oh we're just gonna go full

1410.0 --> 1416.159
terrorist because there's no other way

1412.96 --> 1419.2
well no that definitely

1416.159 --> 1421.679
would probably make things worse

1419.2 --> 1423.76
but it doesn't mean that in action just

1421.679 --> 1425.44
letting it out continue and just saying

1423.76 --> 1430.1589999999999
no

1425.44 --> 1435.44
no until what until you do drown

1430.159 --> 1435.44
till they're yeah till you get locked in

1435.6 --> 1439.039
until you get surrounded by police

1438.159 --> 1441.679
guarding

1439.039 --> 1444.08
you and like literally stopping you at

1441.679 --> 1447.039
gunpoint if you want to go out

1444.08 --> 1448.08
like at one point you know how far will

1447.039 --> 1450.1589999999999
it go

1448.08 --> 1453.4399999999998
it already seems to go pretty damn far

1450.159 --> 1453.44
in certain places so

1457.679 --> 1464.96
yeah it genuinely worries me

1461.52 --> 1464.96
how bad things are getting

1465.52 --> 1472.799
and i know it it like the perpetrators

1469.52 --> 1474.6399999999999
it it can't not be resolved in the end

1472.799 --> 1476.8799999999999
but what else

1474.64 --> 1480.4
how many scars you know that's the

1476.88 --> 1480.4
question how many scars

1480.88 --> 1487.8400000000001
before you don't have any skin left

1495.76 --> 1500.64
sheep would go with us no no what

1498.4 --> 1503.52
defines cheap is that they always go

1500.64 --> 1503.5200000000002
with their captors

1504.0 --> 1507.84
but yeah a lot of people are

1508.0 --> 1515.84
a lot of sheep are kind of like

1511.039 --> 1515.84
yeah they're

1516.96 --> 1522.88
gradually waking up

1520.799 --> 1524.799
you know sheep at first might not really

1522.88 --> 1526.64
want to get away from the flock but they

1524.799 --> 1528.0
might be aware that if you're at the

1526.64 --> 1530.96
dead center of it

1528.0 --> 1532.88
the group then like a big bird might

1530.96 --> 1535.279
come down and pluck somebody out

1532.88 --> 1536.72
so they're like nah we're gonna sit more

1535.279 --> 1540.64
at the edges where it's less

1536.72 --> 1542.24
dense and it'll be less likely we'll be

1540.64 --> 1543.44
picked off but they're still sheep and

1542.24 --> 1546.559
they're still

1543.44 --> 1550.48
yeah not straying too far from the flock

1546.559 --> 1552.0
i know a big bit of a weird metaphor

1550.48 --> 1554.24
but at the same time there's still

1552.0 --> 1556.559
plenty of sheep that are

1554.24 --> 1558.0
yeah waking up from their sheep

1556.559 --> 1561.36
sheepledness

1558.0 --> 1562.72
and are trying to figure out an

1561.36 --> 1564.8799999999999
alternative of

1562.72 --> 1566.32
going about at least psychologically for

1564.88 --> 1568.4
starters they might still be

1566.32 --> 1570.32
in it but they might psychologically

1568.4 --> 1570.96
like figure this is no not viable i have

1570.32 --> 1574.96
to figure out

1570.96 --> 1578.0
how to do this new thing

1574.96 --> 1580.0
this new thing that's not just straight

1578.0 --> 1581.679
out demonic

1580.0 --> 1583.84
and it's going to be very tough on a lot

1581.679 --> 1586.0
of them

1583.84 --> 1587.12
and then yeah if they figure out like

1586.0 --> 1591.12
yeah this works

1587.12 --> 1594.559
i can get i can do this then eventually

1591.12 --> 1597.4399999999998
more people might really step

1594.559 --> 1599.44
out of society that second step no

1597.44 --> 1602.559
longer watch television

1599.44 --> 1602.559
try to homeschool

1602.64 --> 1606.64
yeah try to get a garden and chickens at

1605.039 --> 1609.76
home and all that

1606.64 --> 1611.3600000000001
the basics a lot of people will probably

1609.76 --> 1612.0
do that at some point it's not that

1611.36 --> 1616.0
difficult

1612.0 --> 1621.52
you know but they have to get over

1616.0 --> 1621.52
that surrender to to their captor

1621.679 --> 1625.44
and that's a big threshold for a lot of

1624.88 --> 1628.4
people

1625.44 --> 1629.44
it's just very tough to step away from

1628.4 --> 1631.679
that habit

1629.44 --> 1633.44
that they've probably followed for

1631.679 --> 1636.72
generations

1633.44 --> 1639.279
you know being a sheeple is also

1636.72 --> 1641.039
set by example it's like how do your

1639.279 --> 1642.0
parents respond to something that's

1641.039 --> 1645.76
pretty

1642.0 --> 1648.08
impactful a kid looks at that and thinks

1645.76 --> 1649.76
okay that's how we're supposed to do

1648.08 --> 1651.52
respond to that that's what they learn

1649.76 --> 1655.84
so yeah it

1651.52 --> 1658.399
sheep oldness also becomes

1655.84 --> 1660.32
a family a part of family culture not

1658.399 --> 1662.0
even like up front

1660.32 --> 1663.4399999999998
like they're constantly talking all day

1662.0 --> 1664.559
like how you should definitely follow

1663.44 --> 1667.44
the state not that

1664.559 --> 1668.399
crazy but it'll be part of it in the

1667.44 --> 1670.72
background

1668.399 --> 1672.399
for when an extreme situation arrives

1670.72 --> 1673.44
then that will be the response

1672.399 --> 1678.399
conditioned with it

1673.44 --> 1678.3990000000001
it's automated like that by example

1679.84 --> 1684.08
and hey a lot of these types of

1681.679 --> 1686.0
responses have also been conditioned

1684.08 --> 1686.8799999999999
into the general public the general

1686.0 --> 1689.919
sheeple through

1686.88 --> 1692.0
television scenarios through family

1689.919 --> 1694.72
shows how are these families what of

1692.0 --> 1695.679
what types are in these families what do

1694.72 --> 1698.0
these types do

1695.679 --> 1699.3600000000001
every time people get used to that and

1698.0 --> 1701.919
then people no longer

1699.36 --> 1704.1589999999999
become outraged when they actually meet

1701.919 --> 1705.44
a person face to face that behaves like

1704.159 --> 1709.3600000000001
that even though

1705.44 --> 1711.44
before they would probably be like uh

1709.36 --> 1713.279
like yeah that's not that's not a good

1711.44 --> 1714.799
way to go about but because it's so

1713.279 --> 1716.88
familiar

1714.799 --> 1718.6399999999999
it kind of makes you glad a little

1716.88 --> 1720.88
because yeah you're not

1718.64 --> 1723.039
so uncomfortable it's not so alien to

1720.88 --> 1725.8400000000001
you it feels familiar

1723.039 --> 1725.84
then you don't

1726.88 --> 1732.3200000000002
you don't respond as negative and then

1729.76 --> 1735.84
that behavior is reinforced and it

1732.32 --> 1739.76
helps people to hide their character

1735.84 --> 1743.36
in things in certain stereotypes they've

1739.76 --> 1743.36
been confronted with in their life

1747.95 --> 1753.8400000000001
[Music]

1750.84 --> 1753.84
right

1756.83 --> 1759.8899999999999
[Music]

1764.84 --> 1767.84
hey

1792.84 --> 1797.52
what

1794.0 --> 1800.32
all right well tom see look

1797.52 --> 1800.6399999999999
finding jesus doesn't necessarily make

1800.32 --> 1804.559
you

1800.64 --> 1807.76
happy it's not a oh this happens

1804.559 --> 1810.08
you become happy no no it's

1807.76 --> 1812.24
a new way of approaching things of going

1810.08 --> 1815.279
about that just

1812.24 --> 1818.32
has better rewards it's logos like

1815.279 --> 1821.039
if you it's not even

1818.32 --> 1822.8799999999999
so easily explained like oh just the man

1821.039 --> 1825.6
just that history

1822.88 --> 1826.64
just what it stands for no no it's the

1825.6 --> 1829.36
story

1826.64 --> 1830.0800000000002
the way he goes about it reveals so much

1829.36 --> 1832.24
about

1830.08 --> 1833.9189999999999
the nature of creation of which we're

1832.24 --> 1836.72
all apart

1833.919 --> 1839.8400000000001
and then sets the example it's about the

1836.72 --> 1839.84
the exemplary

1841.52 --> 1850.8799999999999
jesus is exemplary he is an example

1846.159 --> 1853.0390000000002
learn from it look it with care

1850.88 --> 1854.96
careful eyes and then you get it it's

1853.039 --> 1856.559
not about oh it's all jesus and then

1854.96 --> 1859.279
you're happy

1856.559 --> 1859.6789999999999
that's a gross oversimplification and

1859.279 --> 1862.0
hey

1859.679 --> 1862.72
saying that might lure a lot of people

1862.0 --> 1864.96
in

1862.72 --> 1866.3990000000001
that are just not that cognitively

1864.96 --> 1868.3990000000001
elaborate

1866.399 --> 1870.32
so they may think it just works like

1868.399 --> 1871.039
that and then the people that lure them

1870.32 --> 1874.24
in there

1871.039 --> 1876.48
hope that they can sort of like wake

1874.24 --> 1878.96
them up a little bit further

1876.48 --> 1882.24
so they will get closer to what it

1878.96 --> 1882.24
really is supposed to be

1884.64 --> 1893.8400000000001
you believe not in a religion well

1888.48 --> 1893.84
why would you

1897.36 --> 1902.0
okay i follow principles and methods

1905.44 --> 1912.559
and sometimes i try out something extra

1908.72 --> 1915.1200000000001
sometimes i drop it again things change

1912.559 --> 1915.9189999999999
that's how i go about i don't have

1915.12 --> 1918.84
something

1915.919 --> 1920.48
written down that i try to follow to the

1918.84 --> 1924.32
letter

1920.48 --> 1924.32
i do things intuitively

1925.679 --> 1932.64
but because i have this freedom of

1929.519 --> 1935.919
letting my intuition determine

1932.64 --> 1936.64
certain things and not just had being

1935.919 --> 1938.7990000000002
forced

1936.64 --> 1940.3990000000001
to resort to something exoteric to a

1938.799 --> 1942.399
piece of paper to something written by

1940.399 --> 1945.4399999999998
somebody else

1942.399 --> 1948.8799999999999
by letting my intuition do things i also

1945.44 --> 1951.3600000000001
risk that my ego will

1948.88 --> 1952.5590000000002
try to use my intuition and all that to

1951.36 --> 1955.9189999999999
play tricks on me

1952.559 --> 1958.559
and get me to deviate again because

1955.919 --> 1960.88
that's the ego it always tries that [ __ ]

1958.559 --> 1962.08
always no matter how well you're doing

1960.88 --> 1964.88
it always tries to find

1962.08 --> 1965.6789999999999
something and i was even warned of this

1964.88 --> 1967.679
because i

1965.679 --> 1969.679
shared with a lot of people even when i

1967.679 --> 1971.279
was very young that i definitely trust

1969.679 --> 1973.2
my intuition

1971.279 --> 1975.039
they were like oh but even that can fool

1973.2 --> 1978.3990000000001
you and it's like what

1975.039 --> 1978.399
but i have to trust it

1979.679 --> 1982.96
the problem is though that just trusting

1982.72 --> 1984.88
is

1982.96 --> 1986.96
is does not mean that you will always

1984.88 --> 1990.96
know how to respond to what you're

1986.96 --> 1992.799
sensing with your intuition

1990.96 --> 1995.039
so thinking that just because you have a

1992.799 --> 1997.12
good intuition

1995.039 --> 1999.84
that that it automatically means you

1997.12 --> 2003.12
always have the right response

1999.84 --> 2005.6
that's where i was wrong

2003.12 --> 2007.5189999999998
it really requires inside oversight

2005.6 --> 2011.12
knowledge and wisdom

2007.519 --> 2012.08
on top of that to properly utilize the

2011.12 --> 2015.279
intuition

2012.08 --> 2016.559
intuition is one is a tool but you need

2015.279 --> 2018.96
a map

2016.559 --> 2019.9189999999999
for that tool in order to properly use

2018.96 --> 2023.3600000000001
it otherwise you're

2019.919 --> 2024.88
yeah you're going to be still blind you

2023.36 --> 2026.4799999999998
might make

2024.88 --> 2027.919
better choices on effort but you're

2026.48 --> 2031.279
still going to be blind as to

2027.919 --> 2035.039
what direction you are going in life

2031.279 --> 2035.039
that's where the wisdom is so important

2043.76 --> 2047.279
yeah but tom see it's not as simple as

2046.88 --> 2050.48
that

2047.279 --> 2052.399
see you're doing it again

2050.48 --> 2054.32
you believe in christ and christ has

2052.399 --> 2057.919
rules for you to follow

2054.32 --> 2061.119
therefore it's religion no no no no

2057.919 --> 2066.399
let me re-explain what you just said

2061.119 --> 2070.0
in a in a much more meaningful context

2066.399 --> 2073.839
if you realize what

2070.0 --> 2076.96
christ stands for

2073.839 --> 2079.119
what his purpose is within the spectrum

2076.96 --> 2082.399
of creation

2079.119 --> 2086.0
and the creator then you

2082.399 --> 2089.52
realize that there are rules

2086.0 --> 2091.28
or rather mechanisms mechani

2089.52 --> 2094.159
rules are like mechanisms there's

2091.28 --> 2097.52
mechanisms within creation out there

2094.159 --> 2100.8
and if you if you follow them

2097.52 --> 2102.0
it'll be good for you if you walk away

2100.8 --> 2104.8
from them

2102.0 --> 2105.76
consciously or even unconscious if you

2104.8 --> 2108.0
walk away from it

2105.76 --> 2109.079
unconsciously you will be like slapped

2108.0 --> 2112.96
on the fingers

2109.079 --> 2114.8390000000004
metaphorically so this is not just about

2112.96 --> 2116.7200000000003
following rules now it's just about the

2114.839 --> 2120.16
consequences

2116.72 --> 2123.04
this is not like

2120.16 --> 2124.0789999999997
a law book like that no this is about

2123.04 --> 2127.52
the workings

2124.079 --> 2130.2400000000002
of creation and if you don't

2127.52 --> 2131.44
follow if you deviate in certain ways

2130.24 --> 2134.0789999999997
you will notice

2131.44 --> 2134.8
and if you double down you will be

2134.079 --> 2138.7200000000003
punished

2134.8 --> 2141.119
measurably but the punishment again is a

2138.72 --> 2145.1189999999997
metaphor because punishment suggests

2141.119 --> 2146.1600000000003
one thing to another no no the creation

2145.119 --> 2149.6800000000003
itself

2146.16 --> 2152.7999999999997
will respond in what will very

2149.68 --> 2156.3999999999996
likely be perceived by the receiver

2152.8 --> 2158.079
as a punishment because they personify

2156.4 --> 2159.92
things because of the nature of the

2158.079 --> 2162.7200000000003
individual and the psyche

2159.92 --> 2164.8
individu again similar to physicality

2162.72 --> 2165.839
assumption bias you personify things we

2164.8 --> 2169.599
do it with god

2165.839 --> 2171.119
even though it can't really do that

2169.599 --> 2174.56
it's even said that you're not supposed

2171.119 --> 2177.6800000000003
to do that but we can't help it

2174.56 --> 2181.68
it's too difficult for most people not

2177.68 --> 2185.52
to personify god they can't

2181.68 --> 2187.839
grasp it the way it really is

2185.52 --> 2189.119
mechanically but yeah that's how i see

2187.839 --> 2192.24
it so it's not just

2189.119 --> 2194.56
you got to follow these rules or this

2192.24 --> 2200.4799999999996
will happen or that will happen

2194.56 --> 2204.88
no it's more complicated

2200.48 --> 2208.64
describes the rules are

2204.88 --> 2208.6400000000003
like a really good advice

2209.599 --> 2216.56
and a pointer at certain things

2213.359 --> 2219.92
that that happen that are out there

2216.56 --> 2223.04
and what yeah what it can do

2219.92 --> 2226.16
and that is described in stories

2223.04 --> 2229.92
so see see how suddenly

2226.16 --> 2230.8799999999997
that sentence you said becomes a whole

2229.92 --> 2233.52
different

2230.88 --> 2233.52
context

2236.64 --> 2241.359
right well tom c you'd be surprised if

2239.76 --> 2244.7200000000003
you're well spoken

2241.359 --> 2245.2
confident and respectful if you don't

2244.72 --> 2248.8799999999997
let your

2245.2 --> 2252.7999999999997
ego lash out in this

2248.88 --> 2254.0
sensitive department of religion and

2252.8 --> 2255.76
spirituality

2254.0 --> 2259.119
then yeah you might find that you can

2255.76 --> 2262.48
just communicate with religious people

2259.119 --> 2263.6800000000003
from a respectful angle right

2262.48 --> 2266.4
very important otherwise you're not

2263.68 --> 2269.68
gonna they're just gonna be defensive

2266.4 --> 2272.32
and then you can actually figure out

2269.68 --> 2274.16
that they do agree to this

2272.32 --> 2276.2400000000002
and that i don't know on top of that

2274.16 --> 2279.1189999999997
they might still hold on to a

2276.24 --> 2281.2
very literal rigid approach like no you

2279.119 --> 2282.56
just never do this or this will happen

2281.2 --> 2284.7999999999997
because they've kind of gotten

2282.56 --> 2287.7599999999998
conditioned with that specific

2284.8 --> 2288.2400000000002
esoteric approach that happens a lot

2287.76 --> 2290.48
with

2288.24 --> 2292.72
community people that are community

2290.48 --> 2294.32
religious

2292.72 --> 2296.48
they do what do themselves do to each

2294.32 --> 2301.2000000000003
other to lock themselves into

2296.48 --> 2301.2
yeah exoteric literal interpretations

2302.0 --> 2305.28
but if you explain what i just tried to

2304.16 --> 2308.3999999999996
explain to you they

2305.28 --> 2314.2400000000002
will most of them will definitely

2308.4 --> 2314.2400000000002
feel it they will feel that it's right

2315.119 --> 2322.079
because it reflects well

2319.44 --> 2323.52
upon their reflection of like the book

2322.079 --> 2325.6800000000003
and things like if it is

2323.52 --> 2327.04
correct if it is in tune they will feel

2325.68 --> 2328.7999999999997
it even though

2327.04 --> 2331.2799999999997
if they have their own little rule

2328.8 --> 2334.48
things that they preoccupy them with is

2331.28 --> 2337.52
completely away from you if you get it

2334.48 --> 2337.52
they will feel it

2339.599 --> 2345.04
that's my experience and that's even

2341.599 --> 2345.04
with with muslims too

2345.2 --> 2353.359
it's any religion it's always

2350.0 --> 2356.72
it's always about the ego every time

2353.359 --> 2358.88
and hey people in any religion can get

2356.72 --> 2362.0
preoccupied

2358.88 --> 2363.839
literally occupied preoccupied occupied

2362.0 --> 2366.32
by their ego

2363.839 --> 2368.0789999999997
and they will use that ego as a social

2366.32 --> 2370.88
weapon within their religion to

2368.079 --> 2372.4
reinforce control or something that's

2370.88 --> 2376.2400000000002
not good

2372.4 --> 2378.56
that's not it's rarely

2376.24 --> 2380.0
an honest true spiritual part of the

2378.56 --> 2383.2
religious

2380.0 --> 2386.32
core the essence of it all

2383.2 --> 2389.359
but yeah people do it anyway

2386.32 --> 2392.7200000000003
and it yeah it holds the group together

2389.359 --> 2394.4
in in the world that is kind of being

2392.72 --> 2394.8799999999997
pushed around and dragged around by

2394.4 --> 2397.839
money

2394.88 --> 2397.839
so

2403.599 --> 2408.1600000000003
no totally disagree tom c

2408.839 --> 2411.839
nope

2412.96 --> 2417.599
it's not icons

2419.599 --> 2424.1600000000003
or even beliefs that drive that divide

2423.2 --> 2427.52
people no

2424.16 --> 2427.52
it's behavior

2430.8 --> 2434.96
it's the behavior that drives them apart

2433.2 --> 2438.16
if people just

2434.96 --> 2440.7200000000003
in one religious group use the other

2438.16 --> 2443.2799999999997
religion as a scapegoat as a lower class

2440.72 --> 2445.4399999999996
to vent off their ego frustrations with

2443.28 --> 2447.2000000000003
life and everything

2445.44 --> 2448.64
then yeah they're very likely that the

2447.2 --> 2449.839
other group is going to do the same and

2448.64 --> 2452.7999999999997
then that

2449.839 --> 2455.2
is what's going to sustain war between

2452.8 --> 2458.48
the two religions

2455.2 --> 2459.5989999999997
but that's not uniform that's not always

2458.48 --> 2462.64
going to happen

2459.599 --> 2464.8
it's been plenty of regions and

2462.64 --> 2466.48
moments in history where different

2464.8 --> 2468.079
religions would be

2466.48 --> 2469.92
people with different religions would be

2468.079 --> 2470.2400000000002
very living very close to one another

2469.92 --> 2472.88
and

2470.24 --> 2475.2799999999997
really have a community like a

2472.88 --> 2477.52
multi-religious community that would

2475.28 --> 2479.599
do their best to get respect each other

2477.52 --> 2483.2
and get a better understanding

2479.599 --> 2487.28
it's very possible it doesn't always

2483.2 --> 2490.96
end up in in religious based conflict

2487.28 --> 2491.599
doesn't that's if that does happen it's

2490.96 --> 2494.96
usually

2491.599 --> 2497.6800000000003
regional and has to do with the people

2494.96 --> 2497.68
themselves

2498.319 --> 2506.4
more than the actual religion

2503.2 --> 2510.7999999999997
you know there's plenty of

2506.4 --> 2513.359
religions out there that have attacked

2510.8 --> 2515.6800000000003
fellow religious groups of the same

2513.359 --> 2519.52
supposed religion too you know

2515.68 --> 2522.16
just saying so it's not really about it

2519.52 --> 2523.359
it's about people it's about people and

2522.16 --> 2528.72
their egos

2523.359 --> 2536.319
and their needs to degrade another group

2528.72 --> 2538.7999999999997
to vent off their ego issues that's it

2536.319 --> 2539.599
or it's just about pure dominance like

2538.8 --> 2542.96
no we

2539.599 --> 2543.92
want more we need more we need so we're

2542.96 --> 2550.8
just going to

2543.92 --> 2553.119
crush that group and to rob them of it

2550.8 --> 2554.2400000000002
that's kind of the same thing it's even

2553.119 --> 2557.839
a step further it's like

2554.24 --> 2557.839
really almost yeah

2558.4 --> 2566.319
like animals do things just conquer it

2562.8 --> 2568.48
conquer the other group take all their

2566.319 --> 2571.839
wives and all their resources and

2568.48 --> 2575.599
yeah take over

2571.839 --> 2575.599
animals do that too

2576.0 --> 2581.28
but that's definitely not how christ

2578.319 --> 2583.04
would recommend you do things

2581.28 --> 2585.2000000000003
except maybe when you're dealing with

2583.04 --> 2587.52
pharisees

2585.2 --> 2589.4399999999996
but i'm pretty sure they don't yeah i

2587.52 --> 2593.839
don't know don't

2589.44 --> 2593.839
don't literally quote me on that

2603.03 --> 2606.079
[Music]

2619.04 --> 2622.24
yeah well tommy tom see i i don't think

2621.92 --> 2624.7200000000003
you

2622.24 --> 2625.359
really have a good grasp on what

2624.72 --> 2629.2
religion

2625.359 --> 2631.839
is it seems like you're using it as a

2629.2 --> 2631.839
straw man

2633.04 --> 2636.8
because everything i've i've been

2635.44 --> 2639.92
explaining so much

2636.8 --> 2641.2000000000003
already addressing you mind you you know

2639.92 --> 2643.28
this conversation was pretty much

2641.2 --> 2646.48
towards you

2643.28 --> 2648.5600000000004
and you should know better by now

2646.48 --> 2663.839
from what i've told you unless you

2648.56 --> 2663.839
didn't listen

2688.839 --> 2691.839
okay

2702.839 --> 2705.839
hmm

2706.48 --> 2719.839
uh seeking star order what

2726.319 --> 2733.839
oh is that some kind of french whatever

2770.96 --> 2778.4
all right well tom c you know what

2775.44 --> 2779.119
there's a lot of people that agree with

2778.4 --> 2783.839
that

2779.119 --> 2787.2000000000003
you know like the word religion

2783.839 --> 2790.48
what is it even you know at this point

2787.2 --> 2793.359
feels to me like religion has become

2790.48 --> 2797.119
such a scattered word in its meaning

2793.359 --> 2799.68
how people actually use it that

2797.119 --> 2800.7200000000003
yeah you could have conversations where

2799.68 --> 2803.44
people would

2800.72 --> 2805.52
supposedly talk about it and then

2803.44 --> 2807.44
completely miss the point

2805.52 --> 2808.96
because they're both talking about

2807.44 --> 2810.56
completely different things it's almost

2808.96 --> 2813.76
like the word science

2810.56 --> 2817.2
it's very obvious like the word science

2813.76 --> 2818.88
becomes so broad and well

2817.2 --> 2821.04
look at the original what it really

2818.88 --> 2823.92
supposed to be

2821.04 --> 2827.7599999999998
it's a mess it's it's been made a mess

2823.92 --> 2827.76
and they've done the same with religion

2828.079 --> 2834.48
because is following christ

2831.76 --> 2837.119
the principles and the path is that

2834.48 --> 2837.119
religion

2838.079 --> 2845.2000000000003
or is religion organized religion

2841.359 --> 2848.96
is religion a priesthood

2845.2 --> 2851.5989999999997
and a book and followers

2848.96 --> 2851.599
what is it

2852.24 --> 2856.5589999999997
you know people say also especially the

2855.359 --> 2859.2
science people

2856.559 --> 2861.0400000000004
love to say little religion is about

2859.2 --> 2862.48
believing in something you have no proof

2861.04 --> 2866.88
for oh

2862.48 --> 2869.04
yeah yeah we know that's why we call

2866.88 --> 2870.6400000000003
the heliocentric ball spinning ball

2869.04 --> 2874.079
earth model

2870.64 --> 2876.4
a religion that's exactly why we call

2874.079 --> 2878.319
that a religion because of that

2876.4 --> 2880.0
because of believing in something you

2878.319 --> 2883.04
have no proof for

2880.0 --> 2885.359
well guess what we have plenty of proof

2883.04 --> 2888.24
for a creator

2885.359 --> 2888.5589999999997
and there's plenty of historical proof

2888.24 --> 2890.9599999999996
for

2888.559 --> 2893.76
jesus christ as well whatever he's

2890.96 --> 2893.76
supposed to be called

2895.839 --> 2900.0789999999997
so yeah that doesn't mean that it is

2899.04 --> 2903.359
proof that

2900.079 --> 2905.8390000000004
of the ultimate all in a direct sense

2903.359 --> 2905.839
it's not like

2906.8 --> 2911.52
it's not scientific proof you know it

2909.52 --> 2913.44
can't be repeated

2911.52 --> 2915.68
there's been no rep repetition of

2913.44 --> 2916.0
jesus's miracles or anything as far as i

2915.68 --> 2920.0789999999997
know

2916.0 --> 2929.839
although yeah maybe there is

2920.079 --> 2929.8390000000004
it's it's complex

2932.96 --> 2943.839
write more colors exactly

2958.64 --> 2971.839
all right so there you go

2972.28 --> 2979.4300000000003
[Music]

3010.839 --> 3016.72
so

3012.48 --> 3020.2400000000002
it scares you when you read it sometimes

3016.72 --> 3022.319
but yeah it should there's

3020.24 --> 3027.839
look there's a lot of darkness in there

3022.319 --> 3027.839
as well

3028.16 --> 3041.839
yes tom c they have

3076.24 --> 3081.2799999999997
yeah and look there's

3079.28 --> 3083.0400000000004
there's really strange things with the

3081.28 --> 3087.2000000000003
bible you know and the whole

3083.04 --> 3091.2
prophecy prophecies with that

3087.2 --> 3091.2
things to come because

3091.76 --> 3095.6800000000003
i'm just getting this over time more

3094.079 --> 3100.0
more sensation

3095.68 --> 3103.5989999999997
it's an intuitive thing so this is like

3100.0 --> 3104.8
it's i can't like completely confirm it

3103.599 --> 3107.52
but i just get this

3104.8 --> 3107.52
feeling like

3108.319 --> 3114.319
the bible is real but what we're seeing

3111.839 --> 3116.88
out there is not it

3114.319 --> 3118.4
i feel sometimes like the controlling

3116.88 --> 3122.839
elite

3118.4 --> 3125.52
are using the bible as a larp

3122.839 --> 3128.0789999999997
playbook like they've studied it

3125.52 --> 3129.68
they figured out the the yeah the

3128.079 --> 3133.2000000000003
devilish

3129.68 --> 3136.48
systems they figured out like why

3133.2 --> 3140.7999999999997
and they kind of started to

3136.48 --> 3146.0
build their blueprint upon it

3140.8 --> 3149.04
by artificially inducing it

3146.0 --> 3152.559
so they're they're basically creating

3149.04 --> 3155.599
the scenario based on on the bible

3152.559 --> 3157.8390000000004
but it i don't think it is the i think

3155.599 --> 3158.8
that if these things in the bible should

3157.839 --> 3161.92
transpire

3158.8 --> 3165.52
exactly like that

3161.92 --> 3169.119
there would be no plan it would just

3165.52 --> 3171.119
inevitably happen like that without much

3169.119 --> 3172.7200000000003
consideration it would just happen

3171.119 --> 3177.04
because there was no other way

3172.72 --> 3181.839
like that it would not be planned

3177.04 --> 3181.839
like a century at a time like it is now

3185.52 --> 3194.079
you know that's

3188.64 --> 3196.64
the most weird part about it

3194.079 --> 3198.8
it almost feels like the elites have

3196.64 --> 3201.839
just started this giant larp

3198.8 --> 3203.599
play of something that's supposed to

3201.839 --> 3206.24
inevitably happen in the far

3203.599 --> 3208.1600000000003
future and they're just making everyone

3206.24 --> 3210.0789999999997
believe like it's happening right now

3208.16 --> 3212.0789999999997
they're like they're using the entire

3210.079 --> 3215.119
world like a giant

3212.079 --> 3217.599
play to suggest

3215.119 --> 3219.6800000000003
that that apocalypse from the bible is

3217.599 --> 3222.2400000000002
happening right now and hey there's a

3219.68 --> 3223.9199999999996
lot to talk about right then

3222.24 --> 3226.0789999999997
because a lot of people are like why is

3223.92 --> 3228.4
reality is seeming so much like what the

3226.079 --> 3231.28
bible talks about

3228.4 --> 3232.88
and then blah blah blah blah blah i can

3231.28 --> 3233.599
tell you exactly why and i'm going to

3232.88 --> 3236.6400000000003
point out

3233.599 --> 3238.88
how to reinforce

3236.64 --> 3240.5589999999997
that assumption that what's described in

3238.88 --> 3242.079
the bible is actually now because

3240.559 --> 3243.52
there's so much to compare it to and

3242.079 --> 3245.92
then it's like oh

3243.52 --> 3248.079
we feel like we're on the side of christ

3245.92 --> 3251.2000000000003
in the holy war and

3248.079 --> 3254.7200000000003
to a certain degree yes

3251.2 --> 3258.319
you know you should oppose blatant ugly

3254.72 --> 3261.839
darkness why is my

3258.319 --> 3261.839
freaking video

3263.599 --> 3269.6800000000003
you should whether it is

3266.72 --> 3270.64
a larp play and created by the elite or

3269.68 --> 3274.8799999999997
it would be the

3270.64 --> 3274.8799999999997
the real thing because i'm not 100 sure

3275.76 --> 3281.8390000000004
there should be a response but yeah i do

3278.72 --> 3281.839
think like it was

3282.0 --> 3284.24
like

3285.68 --> 3290.0789999999997
yeah like the biblical end is being

3290.839 --> 3298.0
worldwide larped

3294.88 --> 3299.2000000000003
it's being created on purpose to

3298.0 --> 3306.559
resemble it

3299.2 --> 3308.64
in as much detail as they can

3306.559 --> 3312.0
and that there yeah that the plan was to

3308.64 --> 3312.0
specifically aim for that

3312.319 --> 3320.799
almost to claim the antichrist like that

3316.72 --> 3324.48
they tried to claim it

3320.799 --> 3324.48
and yeah they're in the process

3325.68 --> 3329.7599999999998
they're there for they they want to

3327.52 --> 3332.079
fulfill that role or they want to at

3329.76 --> 3334.4
least

3332.079 --> 3336.48
make that happen in order to yeah get

3334.4 --> 3338.319
more earthly riches out of it on the

3336.48 --> 3342.319
short run

3338.319 --> 3344.799
no like short-sighted

3342.319 --> 3346.16
seductions of earthly riches and all

3344.799 --> 3348.48
that

3346.16 --> 3351.839
always seems to work for the darkness

3348.48 --> 3355.119
for dark plants so far

3351.839 --> 3363.839
and blackmail and of course all that so

3355.119 --> 3363.839
yeah but

3365.44 --> 3370.4
right agm that's yeah that's one way to

3368.0 --> 3370.4
put it

3371.44 --> 3375.52
they they want to tempt him they want to

3373.599 --> 3378.0
like like oh yeah are you

3375.52 --> 3379.44
are you going to show up we're doing

3378.0 --> 3382.96
everything that's written here

3379.44 --> 3385.119
right like that that they're really like

3382.96 --> 3391.839
ah

3385.119 --> 3391.839
are you really going to do that

3394.96 --> 3401.119
when you think about it it is like it is

3397.76 --> 3404.7990000000004
like the ultimate defiance really

3401.119 --> 3406.7200000000003
it's like oh so this is what

3404.799 --> 3407.92
what the antichrist and the devil is

3406.72 --> 3411.9199999999996
right okay we

3407.92 --> 3415.76
are going to do exactly that

3411.92 --> 3418.96
like what bigger defiance against

3415.76 --> 3421.28
against yeah jesus and

3418.96 --> 3422.16
the will of the creator what bigger

3421.28 --> 3426.079
thing could you do

3422.16 --> 3429.359
than to literally rush

3426.079 --> 3431.04
towards the end like that you know

3429.359 --> 3434.61
so yeah it does make sense like that

3431.04 --> 3437.729
from a satanic perspective

3434.61 --> 3437.7290000000003
[Music]

3443.839 --> 3447.839
because just yeah

3452.48 --> 3457.52
just let's get hypothetical

3455.52 --> 3458.88
look pretty extremely hypothetical for a

3457.52 --> 3460.96
second

3458.88 --> 3462.96
you know everybody's heard of like blue

3460.96 --> 3464.48
book and all the ideas that there's

3462.96 --> 3467.2
going to be some iconic

3464.48 --> 3468.96
religious figure that might you know and

3467.2 --> 3470.0789999999997
then everybody is reminded through the

3468.96 --> 3472.96
bible like oh yeah

3470.079 --> 3474.079
that must be the false prophet or yeah

3472.96 --> 3476.4
they're gonna

3474.079 --> 3478.079
make people do that and break with the

3476.4 --> 3481.599
bible and

3478.079 --> 3483.04
right so now imagine this what if they

3481.599 --> 3486.0
just did that

3483.04 --> 3487.44
and would be so obvious you know we're

3486.0 --> 3489.92
already being

3487.44 --> 3491.119
manipulated like this with nasa nasa

3489.92 --> 3496.319
does things that are

3491.119 --> 3498.48
so obviously fake it's like on purpose

3496.319 --> 3500.079
so what if there is like a i don't know

3498.48 --> 3502.0
blue book or whatever

3500.079 --> 3503.3590000000004
related new operation you know they

3502.0 --> 3505.04
probably could do a lot better than they

3503.359 --> 3507.119
could then

3505.04 --> 3508.72
and they just make this false prophet

3507.119 --> 3509.92
figure show up and then like all the

3508.72 --> 3513.1189999999997
satanists are going to be oh this

3509.92 --> 3515.76
is the this is the real savior

3513.119 --> 3516.48
and oh yeah maybe he has devil horns and

3515.76 --> 3518.48
all that uh

3516.48 --> 3519.52
what are you racist or something

3518.48 --> 3521.52
whatever you know

3519.52 --> 3522.559
something ridiculous something so over

3521.52 --> 3525.359
the top that

3522.559 --> 3525.6800000000003
you got to be like literally brain dead

3525.359 --> 3528.16
not

3525.68 --> 3529.359
to see that it's definitely a false

3528.16 --> 3533.1189999999997
prophet fake

3529.359 --> 3536.5589999999997
you know and then [ __ ] happens

3533.119 --> 3539.6800000000003
what then if well

3536.559 --> 3542.4
another figure after that would come

3539.68 --> 3544.0
in whatever manner and he would look

3542.4 --> 3546.079
pretty damn close to

3544.0 --> 3547.92
what everybody would imagine christ to

3546.079 --> 3549.44
look like and who knows maybe he even

3547.92 --> 3551.52
has a halo and all that

3549.44 --> 3553.119
maybe every word that comes out of him

3551.52 --> 3556.96
is like perfect

3553.119 --> 3559.76
or to us what if that

3556.96 --> 3560.559
is not the real christ either because

3559.76 --> 3563.6800000000003
the whole

3560.559 --> 3566.48
[ __ ] thing was pre-engineered

3563.68 --> 3567.52
like i said and it's all going to be

3566.48 --> 3572.16
fake

3567.52 --> 3575.92
yeah now what do you do then

3572.16 --> 3578.16
you know when does it become completely

3575.92 --> 3579.2000000000003
self-evident that what is described in

3578.16 --> 3582.96
the bible is

3579.2 --> 3585.9199999999996
literally what is happening right now

3582.96 --> 3601.839
beyond that it is a giant larp being

3585.92 --> 3601.839
played out

3621.599 --> 3624.96
so yeah could anybody follow that train

3624.319 --> 3627.52
of thought

3624.96 --> 3629.839
that realization doesn't that make you

3627.52 --> 3629.839
wonder

3630.0 --> 3633.76
there's going to be some fall obviously

3632.319 --> 3637.2
false christ

3633.76 --> 3639.8390000000004
wouldn't that be suspicious if it really

3637.2 --> 3639.839
was like that

3641.68 --> 3645.2799999999997
wouldn't that be suspicious to any

3644.16 --> 3648.24
supposed

3645.28 --> 3648.88
jesus figure that would inevitably come

3648.24 --> 3652.72
after

3648.88 --> 3654.48
right but if the antichrist figure

3652.72 --> 3655.839
whatever the false prophet would be too

3654.48 --> 3658.799
obvious

3655.839 --> 3660.88
then isn't that just like a giant

3658.799 --> 3662.559
warning light to people in their mind

3660.88 --> 3665.44
like holy [ __ ]

3662.559 --> 3667.3590000000004
the whole thing might be completely fake

3665.44 --> 3669.92
not that it's

3667.359 --> 3672.0
that it was never real it's just that it

3669.92 --> 3674.799
happening now might have been a setup

3672.0 --> 3674.799
from the start

3675.04 --> 3678.88
they literally planned that [ __ ]

3681.04 --> 3685.839
see what i'm saying

3686.559 --> 3690.48
antichrist christ should be here soon oh

3689.2 --> 3695.04
yeah yeah yeah

3690.48 --> 3697.28
way to go good servant thanks

3695.04 --> 3699.2799999999997
i've been trying to share this bucket of

3697.28 --> 3700.88
water and telling everybody like this is

3699.28 --> 3703.52
the real danger and the first thing you

3700.88 --> 3706.559
do is put your head in it

3703.52 --> 3713.839
it's brilliant brilliant good servant

3706.559 --> 3713.8390000000004
way to pay attention

3717.92 --> 3727.839
yeah you too again brilliant

3730.48 --> 3734.079
did either of you listen to a single

3733.44 --> 3738.4
word

3734.079 --> 3738.4
that i've been saying in the last 15

3738.839 --> 3741.839
minutes

3766.839 --> 3773.0389999999998
right well then be careful with

3769.92 --> 3775.92
all these predictions

3773.039 --> 3777.5200000000004
like this is going to happen ah oh it's

3775.92 --> 3780.96
going to come up

3777.52 --> 3785.52
really based on what soon

3780.96 --> 3787.599
based on what on a misassumption

3785.52 --> 3789.119
that what is described in the bible is

3787.599 --> 3791.039
actually now when it's

3789.119 --> 3792.559
there's much more evidence that it's

3791.039 --> 3796.3190000000004
been a giant larp

3792.559 --> 3801.3590000000004
set up in the last hundred years to work

3796.319 --> 3804.4
towards emulating scenarios in the bible

3801.359 --> 3811.839
isn't that much more likely

3804.4 --> 3811.839
based on empiricism you know

3815.28 --> 3825.8390000000004
just saying

3826.48 --> 3830.96
oh you think that hm so what do you base

3829.839 --> 3833.2799999999997
that on on

3830.96 --> 3835.28
the signs of the things out there that

3833.28 --> 3838.1600000000003
correlate with the situation in the

3835.28 --> 3841.52
bible exactly as i just explained

3838.16 --> 3842.799
so you base that you think it's more

3841.52 --> 3845.119
likely it's happening

3842.799 --> 3846.88
now because the signs are out there it's

3845.119 --> 3849.92
happening now

3846.88 --> 3850.4
exactly as i said it's been very likely

3849.92 --> 3853.76
to be

3850.4 --> 3855.839
planned to become like that so how do

3853.76 --> 3857.92
you then just justify saying yeah well

3855.839 --> 3860.16
because it's like that i think that is

3857.92 --> 3863.039
now

3860.16 --> 3863.68
what based on what the seasons and signs

3863.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
so which

3863.68 --> 3867.839
season is that which sign is that

3869.68 --> 3873.7599999999998
is it celestial based science because in

3872.72 --> 3876.8799999999997
pretty shows

3873.76 --> 3881.8390000000004
sure those things kind of repeat

3876.88 --> 3881.839
you know over the ages

3882.88 --> 3886.6400000000003
so there may be many seasons

3887.44 --> 3895.839
for such a thing that's all i'm saying

3896.0 --> 3900.319
did i attend college no i did not

3901.68 --> 3905.44
nope never went to university never

3904.16 --> 3910.0789999999997
beyond

3905.44 --> 3910.079
middle school nope

3910.4 --> 3916.4
but i was raised among people that

3913.68 --> 3918.72
yeah my brother did go to university my

3916.4 --> 3918.7200000000003
mother

3919.52 --> 3924.799
was a teacher at a at a high school in

3922.48 --> 3927.839
music

3924.799 --> 3928.16
uh my grandmother used to be a teacher

3927.839 --> 3931.92
my

3928.16 --> 3933.52
aunt is still a teacher i think or maybe

3931.92 --> 3936.7200000000003
retired

3933.52 --> 3938.88
so yeah this we were always about

3936.72 --> 3940.5589999999997
knowledge and [ __ ] and while most of

3938.88 --> 3942.48
them were all reading

3940.559 --> 3943.76
actually reading the books we had a

3942.48 --> 3946.96
library

3943.76 --> 3950.079
i was just this stupid kid

3946.96 --> 3952.96
that just i hate books but please tell

3950.079 --> 3955.2000000000003
me and then i would absolutely absorb

3952.96 --> 3957.2
the story i would listen

3955.2 --> 3965.7599999999998
but please don't make me read it from a

3957.2 --> 3968.16
book i hate that [ __ ]

3965.76 --> 3970.48
although i hope that maybe over time as

3968.16 --> 3974.0789999999997
i get older i will

3970.48 --> 3978.16
become more suitable for

3974.079 --> 3980.1600000000003
reading less quickly distracted i guess

3978.16 --> 3982.319
more patient because that is really

3980.16 --> 3985.0389999999998
something that i i lack a little bit

3982.319 --> 3985.44
when it comes to reading paper like

3985.039 --> 3988.88
books

3985.44 --> 3989.52
actual books and that includes the bible

3988.88 --> 3992.7200000000003
yeah

3989.52 --> 3995.92
that's why i have not re read through it

3992.72 --> 3999.9199999999996
like i at some point i'm just done

3995.92 --> 4001.599
i'm just like new not a single word more

3999.92 --> 4003.44
and not because of the bible it's almost

4001.599 --> 4004.1600000000003
any books just at some point it's just

4003.44 --> 4008.799
like

4004.16 --> 4012.0789999999997
i'm done with this [ __ ] reading sorry

4008.799 --> 4013.599
don't mean to just like

4012.079 --> 4015.2000000000003
i don't know like drinking you know at

4013.599 --> 4021.839
some point you're just full

4015.2 --> 4021.839
well that happens with me in reading

4032.839 --> 4037.0389999999998
what

4034.48 --> 4037.799
yeah mark collard that is true also i've

4037.039 --> 4041.2000000000003
met some

4037.799 --> 4043.68
absolutely [ __ ] people with

4041.2 --> 4045.9199999999996
very big mouth and completely

4043.68 --> 4048.0789999999997
asymmetrical ego issues

4045.92 --> 4050.0
that's that were basically bragging on

4048.079 --> 4053.119
how qualified they were

4050.0 --> 4055.839
but when you'd ask like a slightly more

4053.119 --> 4057.76
complicated technical question

4055.839 --> 4059.839
they would just like completely get

4057.76 --> 4061.039
triggered and start to use peer pressure

4059.839 --> 4064.319
to kind of

4061.039 --> 4066.1600000000003
gaslight you and that happened even back

4064.319 --> 4068.0
then

4066.16 --> 4070.16
because yeah there's nothing worse than

4068.0 --> 4072.24
somebody that thinks they're educated

4070.16 --> 4074.319
and then somebody that hasn't gone

4072.24 --> 4076.9599999999996
through all that hasn't had the papers

4074.319 --> 4078.319
that literally proves they know more and

4076.96 --> 4080.88
understand more than you

4078.319 --> 4082.48
there's nothing more those people hate

4080.88 --> 4084.88
than that

4082.48 --> 4084.88
hate it

4088.319 --> 4095.0389999999998
it's all formal education indoctrination

4093.28 --> 4096.799
i wouldn't know i haven't looked through

4095.039 --> 4101.759
it all

4096.799 --> 4104.799
but you know formal education is usually

4101.759 --> 4108.0
disciplines skills and packages

4104.799 --> 4110.719
of reading material and knowledge and

4108.0 --> 4111.679
the problem is it it changes and it has

4110.719 --> 4114.319
been changing

4111.679 --> 4114.96
especially in the last like 50 years a

4114.319 --> 4117.6
lot

4114.96 --> 4118.56
around the west in america insane and

4117.6 --> 4121.4400000000005
they just

4118.56 --> 4122.319
shove this complete [ __ ] in there

4121.44 --> 4125.44
and literally

4122.319 --> 4129.52
ruin the thing ruin the quality

4125.44 --> 4133.12
of the things that you learn there

4129.52 --> 4136.4800000000005
like old-fashioned classical education

4133.12 --> 4140.0
is really pretty good but

4136.48 --> 4147.839
yeah it's not so

4140.0 --> 4147.839
available these days it's hard to find

4157.759 --> 4161.839
best educations do not lie

4164.239 --> 4167.3589999999995
no that that's that's just advice that's

4167.04 --> 4170.4
not

4167.359 --> 4173.04
education you know

4170.4 --> 4175.839
you know that making mistakes is the

4173.04 --> 4175.839
best education

4178.319 --> 4182.159000000001
you know the best way to learn that

4182.239 --> 4187.759
lying is bad is by

4185.6 --> 4189.679
doing it and making the mistakes

4187.759 --> 4190.56
associated with it that's why there's a

4189.679 --> 4192.96
the time for

4190.56 --> 4194.8
every person in their life that they go

4192.96 --> 4195.36
through like a lying phase as a little

4194.8 --> 4197.84
kid it

4195.36 --> 4199.5199999999995
naturally happens they discover it they

4197.84 --> 4201.679
discover they have to

4199.52 --> 4203.6
learn about it then feel the

4201.679 --> 4206.64
consequences of it

4203.6 --> 4210.0
and then hopefully they'll

4206.64 --> 4211.679
they'll completely drop it or they learn

4210.0 --> 4213.6
to drop it more and more because the

4211.679 --> 4213.92
older you get the wider you get the more

4213.6 --> 4217.52
you

4213.92 --> 4219.52
figure out that it's that it's all

4217.52 --> 4221.280000000001
short-term it's all seductions from the

4219.52 --> 4222.8
ego that make you believe you can get

4221.28 --> 4225.84
somewhere quickly

4222.8 --> 4228.88
and overlook the long-term price

4225.84 --> 4231.6
which you do realize exists

4228.88 --> 4233.1990000000005
when you get older unless you just

4231.6 --> 4234.64
completely burnt yourself out

4233.199 --> 4245.839999999999
psychological through

4234.64 --> 4245.84
insane amounts of sin or something

4250.159 --> 4252.96
breaking stuff

4254.32 --> 4260.48
right it's funny too how that works you

4257.44 --> 4263.759999999999
know even with physical training

4260.48 --> 4265.599999999999
it's like if if you're pretty young and

4263.76 --> 4267.6
you do like fighting sports and you do

4265.6 --> 4271.6
it pretty rough you know

4267.6 --> 4275.1990000000005
like bashing your shins

4271.6 --> 4277.6
into into wood or something

4275.199 --> 4279.04
yeah there you get micro fractures it

4277.6 --> 4280.2390000000005
might hurt a lot especially in the

4279.04 --> 4284.239
beginning

4280.239 --> 4286.639999999999
but then it strengthens so much

4284.239 --> 4288.5599999999995
that some of these people that have had

4286.64 --> 4290.96
pretty good training even in their youth

4288.56 --> 4293.1990000000005
even though they might not be

4290.96 --> 4294.8
very actively training martial arts

4293.199 --> 4295.199
constantly you know they're in life they

4294.8 --> 4298.64
still

4295.199 --> 4298.639999999999
are almost unbreakable

4299.199 --> 4303.12
so it works physically as well

4304.32 --> 4309.36
bones become harder when they have micro

4306.56 --> 4312.400000000001
fractures that heal up properly

4309.36 --> 4314.48
because that that bone scarring

4312.4 --> 4316.96
is actually stronger than the bone

4314.48 --> 4329.839999999999
itself

4316.96 --> 4329.84
that's proven

4333.52 --> 4335.84
right

4341.04 --> 4348.64
yeah mark collard i totally agree

4344.159 --> 4351.28
you know it's kind of weird but in a way

4348.64 --> 4353.1990000000005
i figured that out pretty young so what

4351.28 --> 4354.4
i did is kind of like i had to go to

4353.199 --> 4357.599999999999
school

4354.4 --> 4359.5199999999995
to get the scores but i would go to my

4357.6 --> 4360.2390000000005
parents and my brother as long as he was

4359.52 --> 4363.120000000001
still there

4360.239 --> 4364.5599999999995
because he did move out after a while i

4363.12 --> 4367.36
would go to them

4364.56 --> 4368.2390000000005
for my real education they would teach

4367.36 --> 4372.32
me about

4368.239 --> 4375.36
etymology but the roots of language

4372.32 --> 4376.719
about just how to speak properly how to

4375.36 --> 4378.96
pronounce how to

4376.719 --> 4380.0
pay attention to the details also to the

4378.96 --> 4383.12
magic of

4380.0 --> 4384.0
word of like a really well refined

4383.12 --> 4386.96
sentence

4384.0 --> 4388.719
to experience that and to understand

4386.96 --> 4391.92
what that does

4388.719 --> 4394.32
like and even

4391.92 --> 4396.8
like to compare it like oh we saw this

4394.32 --> 4396.799999999999
person

4397.04 --> 4402.0
speak on television about something why

4399.679 --> 4403.92
was that so appealing

4402.0 --> 4406.239
well because he was using this certain

4403.92 --> 4408.08
type of english and he was very careful

4406.239 --> 4408.799999999999
in how he put out his words and the

4408.08 --> 4412.159
rhythm

4408.8 --> 4415.84
so we analyzed a lot about that speaking

4412.159 --> 4416.32
it's a big thing no it was almost for me

4415.84 --> 4419.52
you know

4416.32 --> 4423.199
like because i didn't

4419.52 --> 4425.6
really want to focus on music so much

4423.199 --> 4426.5599999999995
i was more like no i want to become like

4425.6 --> 4429.84
an orator

4426.56 --> 4431.280000000001
a public speaker but we

4429.84 --> 4433.1990000000005
unfortunately didn't have a lot of

4431.28 --> 4434.639999999999
confidence to like oh yeah i'm gonna

4433.199 --> 4437.44
step in front of like

4434.64 --> 4438.400000000001
a crowd of a thousand or something no i

4437.44 --> 4441.199
was scared

4438.4 --> 4442.96
shitless it was very like but at the

4441.199 --> 4443.44
same time i wanted to be an orator it's

4442.96 --> 4448.32
kind of

4443.44 --> 4451.759999999999
difficult like that but hey guess what

4448.32 --> 4453.599999999999
youtube internet this kind of really

4451.76 --> 4456.320000000001
works for that doesn't it

4453.6 --> 4457.280000000001
it's weird how that worked out i didn't

4456.32 --> 4459.92
know that

4457.28 --> 4462.0
when i was young i had when i was really

4459.92 --> 4463.28
a little kid i had no idea what the

4462.0 --> 4466.4
internet would do

4463.28 --> 4468.0
to everything what would really be

4466.4 --> 4471.599999999999
possible what it would really be

4468.0 --> 4473.84
like i had no idea how it would change

4471.6 --> 4476.64
people i didn't know that either

4473.84 --> 4479.04
i just knew like yeah i really like

4476.64 --> 4482.400000000001
language and speaking

4479.04 --> 4484.159
especially english but also dutch

4482.4 --> 4485.92
and i didn't want to learn every

4484.159 --> 4487.679
language i've never been really good at

4485.92 --> 4490.08
learning all these languages

4487.679 --> 4491.92
had a lot of trouble with it was better

4490.08 --> 4496.32
at math and physics

4491.92 --> 4499.28
surprise surprise intuitive math and

4496.32 --> 4500.96
really physics understanding physics

4499.28 --> 4503.759999999999
understanding

4500.96 --> 4507.76
math intuitively that's that's those

4503.76 --> 4507.76
were a big part of my focus when i was

4508.84 --> 4511.84
younger

4513.84 --> 4520.56
and yeah what do you do with that all

4517.92 --> 4522.4
well i guess you become like a physics

4520.56 --> 4525.1990000000005
teacher

4522.4 --> 4526.0
online when you don't have to deal with

4525.199 --> 4527.599999999999
a big

4526.0 --> 4529.52
class of people in front of you and

4527.6 --> 4531.280000000001
stupid government rules that tell you

4529.52 --> 4532.64
have to take a [ __ ] vaccine or you're

4531.28 --> 4534.48
not alone to do that

4532.64 --> 4537.04
blah blah blah you have to teach them

4534.48 --> 4539.759999999999
about the ball [ __ ]

4537.04 --> 4541.36
and evolution retardation all that no no

4539.76 --> 4544.4800000000005
no no

4541.36 --> 4544.48
this is perfect

4546.159 --> 4549.839999999999
for that unfortunately though it doesn't

4548.4 --> 4555.44
yeah make me

4549.84 --> 4555.4400000000005
a grand living at least just yet

4556.08 --> 4559.12
but at least as a

4560.32 --> 4568.0
as a set of skills as a function

4564.4 --> 4570.879999999999
it does seem to be pretty

4568.0 --> 4570.88
ideal for me

4577.92 --> 4582.32
right math and science were my favorite

4579.84 --> 4582.32
classes

4583.44 --> 4589.44
well math wasn't with me as i said i

4586.48 --> 4592.239
never really liked math but i was

4589.44 --> 4594.5599999999995
my intuition could work with it simply

4592.239 --> 4596.0
used my intuition and my special insight

4594.56 --> 4597.4400000000005
which was very good

4596.0 --> 4600.719
very good was even better when i was

4597.44 --> 4603.199
younger i know how to use it better now

4600.719 --> 4604.64
but it was very sharp when i was young

4603.199 --> 4607.04
like it would

4604.64 --> 4610.56
show me things that would blow my own

4607.04 --> 4615.36
mind away as i was experiencing it

4610.56 --> 4618.400000000001
right so i just learned to

4615.36 --> 4620.08
intuitively grasp math i would solve

4618.4 --> 4622.879999999999
equations not by

4620.08 --> 4623.76
systematically applying it by by just

4622.88 --> 4626.88
seeing it

4623.76 --> 4628.88
by just knowing the feel

4626.88 --> 4629.92
all the numbers i would literally just

4628.88 --> 4631.679
see instead of

4629.92 --> 4633.76
the formula that was presented to the

4631.679 --> 4635.76
required being solving

4633.76 --> 4639.12
i would just see the formula and then

4635.76 --> 4642.320000000001
feel the entire spectrum

4639.12 --> 4644.719
of all possibilities and just

4642.32 --> 4646.32
graph it in my mind and just say that's

4644.719 --> 4648.719
where it's going to be

4646.32 --> 4649.44
and then it was very good at gambling

4648.719 --> 4652.56
that

4649.44 --> 4653.678999999999
it worked out i did my exams on that and

4652.56 --> 4656.56
made it

4653.679 --> 4656.56
worked really well

4656.96 --> 4660.96
and this is weird because there were

4659.199 --> 4664.0
math

4660.96 --> 4665.28
classmates that did really learn the

4664.0 --> 4668.32
disciplines

4665.28 --> 4668.32
and they wouldn't make it

4677.44 --> 4683.199
i went through my math exam very quickly

4681.199 --> 4685.04
it's just my intuition which is a

4683.199 --> 4685.839999999999
certain things i would have to think

4685.04 --> 4688.4
about or

4685.84 --> 4689.8
feel about it a little longer most

4688.4 --> 4693.839999999999
things would just be like

4689.8 --> 4693.84
the the

4704.84 --> 4710.8
right so anyway yeah we

4708.159 --> 4710.799999999999
moved from

4714.8 --> 4718.88
the larp apocalypse of the elite

4719.44 --> 4721.839999999999
to

4723.04 --> 4726.4
school background

4726.56 --> 4728.8
like

4730.08 --> 4734.08
fake education like how stupid people

4733.76 --> 4735.92
are

4734.08 --> 4738.48
sometimes with their papers because they

4735.92 --> 4740.8
go for the papers they go for the

4738.48 --> 4743.36
authority they go for the social

4740.8 --> 4745.76
authority the title

4743.36 --> 4746.48
not for the actual insight that is

4745.76 --> 4749.1990000000005
usually

4746.48 --> 4751.599999999999
so associated with it they'll they're

4749.199 --> 4753.678999999999
just good enough to bluff it

4751.6 --> 4763.84
that's what a lot of people do it's

4753.679 --> 4763.84
really tragic

4774.84 --> 4777.84
hmm

4786.8 --> 4793.52
all right now agm i don't think so it's

4790.159 --> 4796.0
you know history the pro it and by the

4793.52 --> 4799.120000000001
way the same counts for math okay

4796.0 --> 4801.44
math can be just really annoying

4799.12 --> 4802.239
if you have a teacher that doesn't know

4801.44 --> 4805.44
how to

4802.239 --> 4808.879999999999
communicate very well he's just gonna

4805.44 --> 4810.638999999999
write down his dry on the

4808.88 --> 4812.2390000000005
edge where you're thinking in math how

4810.639 --> 4815.4400000000005
he learned it dries

4812.239 --> 4816.5599999999995
[ __ ] down in a monotonous way and then

4815.44 --> 4819.919999999999
people are gonna be like

4816.56 --> 4821.84
uh this is giving me a headache right

4819.92 --> 4823.4400000000005
but if the math teacher was actually

4821.84 --> 4827.28
really

4823.44 --> 4829.12
into the play of learning you know

4827.28 --> 4831.28
then he could present it in a very

4829.12 --> 4833.12
direct way and then kids would get it

4831.28 --> 4834.8
they would totally get the same thing he

4833.12 --> 4835.92
was trying to explain well the same goes

4834.8 --> 4839.12
for history you know

4835.92 --> 4843.04
history some history teachers are like

4839.12 --> 4843.04
like so chronically boring

4844.32 --> 4849.92
okay look at the next slide blah blah

4846.96 --> 4852.159
blah blah blah blah you have to memories

4849.92 --> 4854.4
yeah oh no [ __ ] you can't learn that

4852.159 --> 4856.96
it's boring as [ __ ]

4854.4 --> 4858.799999999999
no if you're gonna convey history you

4856.96 --> 4862.2390000000005
have to

4858.8 --> 4865.28
also convey the enthusiasm with it

4862.239 --> 4868.08
you have to basically share why it is

4865.28 --> 4868.4
valuable to know this you have to make

4868.08 --> 4870.4
them

4868.4 --> 4873.199
understand the value of history and

4870.4 --> 4875.199
knowing these details

4873.199 --> 4877.04
if you can't convey that yeah then

4875.199 --> 4880.719
people they're not gonna learn they're

4877.04 --> 4880.719
just gonna be bored out of their minds

4883.04 --> 4886.48
you know and it's also by the way known

4885.12 --> 4889.199
that

4886.48 --> 4890.08
if if a teacher is particularly

4889.199 --> 4892.4
attractive

4890.08 --> 4893.92
it usually actually downgrades the

4892.4 --> 4896.239
grades

4893.92 --> 4897.6
of the students because they get

4896.239 --> 4899.44
distracted by it

4897.6 --> 4901.120000000001
no yeah you might be sitting there awake

4899.44 --> 4902.879999999999
but if you're just constantly staring at

4901.12 --> 4904.48
the teacher and not listening to what

4902.88 --> 4917.84
they're saying or

4904.48 --> 4917.839999999999
yeah that's not gonna help either so

4919.44 --> 4925.12
and i i yeah i had that problem i had a

4922.56 --> 4931.84
geology teacher that was really sexy

4925.12 --> 4931.84
at some point that totally distracted me

4934.48 --> 4945.839999999999
i think sometimes it was on purpose

4936.96 --> 4945.84
because yeah geology

4956.84 --> 4959.84
anyway

4990.08 --> 4995.04
yeah mark caller too many hormones too

4992.239 --> 4995.04
little wisdom

4996.08 --> 5001.36
prob the problem with me was is that

4999.199 --> 5002.799999999999
people were even like very early on

5001.36 --> 5005.839999999999
trying to hand me

5002.8 --> 5008.159000000001
wisdom but i just refused it

5005.84 --> 5010.08
like i even knew it was right and

5008.159 --> 5013.599999999999
refused it was like how dare you

5010.08 --> 5014.159
take away my opportunity to make those

5013.6 --> 5017.04
mistakes

5014.159 --> 5018.48
and experience it firsthand that was my

5017.04 --> 5021.44
response

5018.48 --> 5022.4
i saw i even said that literally to

5021.44 --> 5026.32
people at times

5022.4 --> 5026.32
they were really freaked out when i did

5026.84 --> 5029.84
that

5038.639 --> 5042.08
well i was a weird kid as i said like i

5040.56 --> 5044.2390000000005
had this weird compartment

5042.08 --> 5046.48
like situation in my mind going on i

5044.239 --> 5048.32
could like my

5046.48 --> 5051.678999999999
there was this part of me from the

5048.32 --> 5055.28
future that's how i felt

5051.679 --> 5056.639
that kind of knew i was engaging in

5055.28 --> 5059.36
stupid things

5056.639 --> 5059.76
and it was like yeah but that's now the

5059.36 --> 5063.759999999999
time

5059.76 --> 5066.56
for it and it knew that

5063.76 --> 5069.04
so it couldn't even though i had the

5066.56 --> 5071.52
wisdom i couldn't stop myself from doing

5069.04 --> 5072.4
it because it it felt it knew i had to

5071.52 --> 5076.0
do that it's

5072.4 --> 5078.159
so weird man so weird

5076.0 --> 5078.159
it

5081.36 --> 5087.839999999999
yeah it's just weird i'm weird

5085.36 --> 5090.799999999999
i always was weird i probably was a lot

5087.84 --> 5099.84
weirder when i was young

5090.8 --> 5099.84
can you imagine that

5105.36 --> 5110.839999999999
i teach you too slowly in school makes

5108.0 --> 5113.84
it completely boring

5110.84 --> 5118.08
meh

5113.84 --> 5119.6
i don't know it depends it depends on

5118.08 --> 5123.5199999999995
the type of school you've

5119.6 --> 5127.1990000000005
you got you know i was still

5123.52 --> 5130.2390000000005
put in the not the highest but

5127.199 --> 5132.638999999999
the somewhat higher education and

5130.239 --> 5133.678999999999
there's plenty of me to be preoccupied

5132.639 --> 5141.84
with

5133.679 --> 5141.84
i didn't think it went too slow

5145.92 --> 5149.52
you know and hey there were even times

5147.76 --> 5153.1990000000005
when it was just in a flow

5149.52 --> 5155.280000000001
and then it i would be like i've already

5153.199 --> 5157.599999999999
done all my homework for the next two

5155.28 --> 5160.639
weeks isn't there something more

5157.6 --> 5165.6
that i can do with this and yeah

5160.639 --> 5167.4400000000005
in those schools they did

5165.6 --> 5168.96
they had they would account for that

5167.44 --> 5173.199
sort of thing and they would

5168.96 --> 5173.199
give me other things to study

5174.32 --> 5178.5599999999995
but yeah that now we're talking like

5177.12 --> 5181.28
before my 13th

5178.56 --> 5182.0
or the 14th or something because after

5181.28 --> 5185.28
that i just got

5182.0 --> 5188.56
really distracted with video games a lot

5185.28 --> 5190.239
and cannabis and just trying to go after

5188.56 --> 5192.2390000000005
girls and

5190.239 --> 5193.5199999999995
not a lot and i was never really good at

5192.239 --> 5195.44
that

5193.52 --> 5197.360000000001
i was really good at just staring at

5195.44 --> 5200.48
them and dreaming

5197.36 --> 5204.4
my ass off but that's it

5200.48 --> 5207.44
although i did try some things at least

5204.4 --> 5207.44
at least i did try

5209.52 --> 5214.96
but before that yeah it was just

5213.199 --> 5215.44
learning and i always wanted to learn

5214.96 --> 5218.56
just

5215.44 --> 5218.5599999999995
as much as i could

5220.32 --> 5224.88
i wouldn't i wouldn't just easily settle

5223.12 --> 5228.8
like okay that's good enough

5224.88 --> 5231.92
no i wanted to know more heavier

5228.8 --> 5234.0
deeper more with more consequences

5231.92 --> 5239.84
of the knowledge i want to understand

5234.0 --> 5239.84
why it's important

5251.33 --> 5254.46
[Music]

5260.08 --> 5267.84
m a t tests

5279.28 --> 5285.599999999999
uh hold on

5282.56 --> 5287.1990000000005
hm i think i think

5285.6 --> 5288.96
you got it slightly off there with the

5287.199 --> 5290.638999999999
cigarette they actually put it in the

5288.96 --> 5294.32
paper

5290.639 --> 5295.36
it's actually the paper that gives the

5294.32 --> 5297.12
steady burn

5295.36 --> 5309.839999999999
not the tobacco itself they put other

5297.12 --> 5309.84
stuff in there

5321.36 --> 5323.839999999999
okay

5330.4 --> 5336.96
metropolitan achievement that's weird

5334.239 --> 5338.879999999999
yeah mark caller i'll tell you something

5336.96 --> 5342.719
i don't know exactly what type of test

5338.88 --> 5342.719
i had but i think it was

5343.52 --> 5348.56
what was that like eight

5346.56 --> 5350.0
or nine i'm not sure when it was but i

5348.56 --> 5353.679
had one test

5350.0 --> 5356.639
two and i was literally tested to be a

5353.679 --> 5359.76
[ __ ] on that

5356.639 --> 5362.56
like then like the

5359.76 --> 5363.52
the school had called up my parents like

5362.56 --> 5366.719
yeah he's

5363.52 --> 5367.84
he's really dumb i suggest you send him

5366.719 --> 5370.2390000000005
to like a school for

5367.84 --> 5372.56
hard learning people my parents were

5370.239 --> 5374.879999999999
completely outraged by that

5372.56 --> 5378.320000000001
because it was obvious that the test

5374.88 --> 5379.76
that i wasn't properly tested because

5378.32 --> 5381.92
when that happened i felt really

5379.76 --> 5382.320000000001
uncomfortable with the person doing that

5381.92 --> 5384.719
and

5382.32 --> 5385.5199999999995
he like he was trying to manipulate me i

5384.719 --> 5387.44
felt so i

5385.52 --> 5388.8
didn't feel safe and then i like kind of

5387.44 --> 5391.919999999999
retract

5388.8 --> 5395.360000000001
i don't put out smarts i think i even

5391.92 --> 5398.719
walked away halfway or something

5395.36 --> 5400.159
but i i don't remember that well i just

5398.719 --> 5402.08
remember my parents

5400.159 --> 5404.5599999999995
telling me afterward that yeah you were

5402.08 --> 5407.679
tested to be on a [ __ ] school

5404.56 --> 5410.2390000000005
which is outrageous

5407.679 --> 5411.04
oh by the way the person who gave me

5410.239 --> 5413.28
that advice

5411.04 --> 5414.159
and the school was closed down later due

5413.28 --> 5417.759999999999
to some

5414.159 --> 5421.839999999999
weird situations so

5417.76 --> 5421.84
there was some weird [ __ ] going on there

5428.8 --> 5435.84
it wasn't an iq test

5451.12 --> 5454.239
is that so agm

5454.56 --> 5458.2390000000005
okay well they certainly if that if

5456.639 --> 5459.679
that's literally what you talk

5458.239 --> 5462.239
if you were talking about what i was

5459.679 --> 5465.04
talking about not something else

5462.239 --> 5466.0
not the iq tests but if you're talking

5465.04 --> 5469.679
about that test well

5466.0 --> 5469.679
certainly damn well felt like that

5472.159 --> 5477.839999999999
basic reading writing math yeah

5492.0 --> 5495.199
frustration level
