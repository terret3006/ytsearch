124.86 --> 128.42
I could still use it

128.58 --> 134.06
all right the weather today is uh

132.36 --> 138.0
difference

134.06 --> 141.48
it's actually a really nice clear spot

138.0 --> 143.58
right as I was starting the show

141.48 --> 146.23899999999998
yeah there's still some big clouds going

143.58 --> 146.239
around as well

147.06 --> 151.7
and a couple of blue spots here and

149.52 --> 151.70000000000002
there

152.34 --> 154.70000000000002
all right

159.84 --> 163.04
and the Sun is bright

165.78 --> 172.099
there's not really any wind that just

169.319 --> 172.099
a tiny bit

177.12 --> 183.0
yeah

179.599 --> 184.56
hello Mike sadunich first in chat good

183.0 --> 191.099
to see you

184.56 --> 191.099
it's Thursday the 20th of January 2022

192.659 --> 197.0
hello hello

193.58 --> 197.0
the other Andrew

197.04 --> 204.62
Sky blood okay

200.659 --> 204.62
hello Jeff gassad

209.459 --> 215.7
oh shy blood oh okay that's some song I

214.2 --> 218.54
guess

215.7 --> 218.54
uh

219.299 --> 221.9
right

223.019 --> 226.94
so yeah I had a pretty late night

228.06 --> 233.159
do it after the show okay

235.5 --> 238.86
Maybe

236.819 --> 240.29899999999998
I'll probably be busy with the flatter

238.86 --> 242.9
debates though

240.299 --> 242.9
uh

245.58 --> 252.5
all right so yeah yesterday's show

249.48 --> 252.5
was a blast

252.659 --> 258.239
I figured out a name for it and I

255.36 --> 261.32
continued its theme today

258.239 --> 261.32
caught up with the joke

262.139 --> 267.0
and still waiting for Adam to make that

265.08 --> 268.38
thumbnail he actually promised me a

267.0 --> 271.52
thumbnail

268.38 --> 271.52
I didn't get any

272.82 --> 276.08
must have been too busy

279.12 --> 282.9
all right but I thought that yes the

281.04 --> 285.18
title I gave yesterday's show was pretty

282.9 --> 289.38
appropriate

285.18 --> 293.28000000000003
oh wait did I get yeah I did

289.38 --> 296.639
toppling the table in our church

293.28 --> 300.96
and then today I thought of like

296.639 --> 303.919
table toppling role-playing game

300.96 --> 303.919
hmm

304.5 --> 310.56
what would that mean

306.72 --> 313.68
that would mean well a role-playing game

310.56 --> 317.52
basically of the a table toppling

313.68 --> 320.28000000000003
emulation of what Christ did or one

317.52 --> 323.28
could say a reenactment

320.28 --> 326.4
of that type of action

323.28 --> 328.44
which I think we're all in need of

326.4 --> 333.12
training which is what role playing

328.44 --> 338.16
originally even was designed for

333.12 --> 341.82
to train yourself for certain scenarios

338.16 --> 345.72
so I thought like yeah

341.82 --> 349.639
my word creativity is kind of active

345.72 --> 349.639
has been activated since yesterday

349.8 --> 355.38
and even during the Flat Earth debates I

351.84 --> 357.56
couldn't help it I was very punny

355.38 --> 357.56
foreign

363.06 --> 366.56
but yeah yesterday I

366.66 --> 372.319
pretty intense put it all down exactly

369.419 --> 372.31899999999996
as I saw it

372.72 --> 378.53900000000004
I've had a good response from the world

375.78 --> 381.79999999999995
overall this time

378.539 --> 381.8
and like the day before

387.0 --> 391.139
uh

388.62 --> 393.24
right have not managed to get my healer

391.139 --> 395.84000000000003
on the phone yet I kind of wanted to

393.24 --> 399.72
still feel like there's some

395.84 --> 403.039
issues like slumbering

399.72 --> 403.03900000000004
underneath all that

404.46 --> 406.52
um

410.039 --> 415.199
right

412.02 --> 418.08
but yeah I I wasn't necessarily going to

415.199 --> 419.46000000000004
continue yesterday's theme onto Today's

418.08 --> 423.5
Show

419.46 --> 423.5
I feel a lot less stressed out

424.56 --> 432.979
but yeah I am

427.38 --> 432.979
kind of just trying to arrange things

433.979 --> 441.539
lots of things that are worn and broken

437.099 --> 444.12
and I'm trying to get them fixed somehow

441.539 --> 446.28
and yeah it's

444.12 --> 448.68
it's wearing on me a bit it actually

446.28 --> 450.71999999999997
kept me up last night like how am I

448.68 --> 452.759
gonna pay for all this

450.72 --> 454.699
like

452.759 --> 458.699
yeah I don't know

454.699 --> 461.52000000000004
it kind of Drew my focus out so I had

458.699 --> 465.72
trouble sleeping annoying

461.52 --> 470.28
but yeah I still feel decently rested

465.72 --> 472.639
and yeah the nice Sun Visa Sun kind of

470.28 --> 475.31899999999996
help this time interesting enough

472.639 --> 478.5
sometimes in the morning when I don't

475.319 --> 482.28000000000003
feel good it's like the sun is like ah

478.5 --> 485.639
it's making me nauseated or overly tense

482.28 --> 489.19899999999996
this time it was actually really welcome

485.639 --> 489.199
trying to figure that one out

491.46 --> 495.37899999999996
Grabbers are still in the churches

512.94 --> 519.86
all right anyway

515.479 --> 519.86
uh what what's going on yesterday

520.519 --> 526.08
uh mostly Flat Earth debates was a very

524.279 --> 528.66
long after show

526.08 --> 530.1
and a very long conversation after the

528.66 --> 532.4399999999999
after show

530.1 --> 533.7
lots of energy it's a really interesting

532.44 --> 536.94
show

533.7 --> 539.1600000000001
got a bit weird again with the Neil this

536.94 --> 541.3800000000001
time

539.16 --> 543.54
getting old domish

541.38 --> 546.8
and you wouldn't let it go so I started

543.54 --> 546.8
calling him a dome ass

549.0 --> 554.519
and such

551.16 --> 556.8
which he actually thought was funny

554.519 --> 559.08
but yeah we were very

556.8 --> 560.64
technical with the debate among one

559.08 --> 562.8000000000001
another

560.64 --> 565.74
I don't remember if there was actually a

562.8 --> 567.63
baller that got on yesterday

565.74 --> 569.279
was there remember it

567.63 --> 572.04
[Music]

569.279 --> 575.3389999999999
I did go out for groceries though

572.04 --> 579.0799999999999
so today I probably will not

575.339 --> 579.08
because I've already done them this time

582.0 --> 586.5
turn the tables

583.98 --> 588.4200000000001
is that even a saying we have to turn

586.5 --> 592.88
the tables

588.42 --> 592.88
huh is that actually based on

593.04 --> 598.3389999999999
on the Christ action

595.56 --> 598.3389999999999
it's interesting

609.0 --> 612.079
all right anyway

622.62 --> 626.3
let me take a look around

655.26 --> 659.66
you can turn the table left or right

659.76 --> 662.64
um

660.36 --> 665.0600000000001
or you could turn it on its side the

662.64 --> 665.06
other Andrew

669.6 --> 674.64
which would effectively topple it and

672.06 --> 677.04
make it to yeah turn over on its back

674.64 --> 681.26
probably

677.04 --> 681.26
or have it stand on its side

695.04 --> 698.0
right anyway

700.38 --> 704.88
I'm shy for subjects because yeah I

703.079 --> 709.2199999999999
could we could endlessly talk

704.88 --> 709.22
metaphorically about tables and all that

710.82 --> 717.4200000000001
but if yeah you want to go beyond an

714.0 --> 719.42
exit terrorization of

717.42 --> 722.16
the metaphor

719.42 --> 725.12
we're gonna have to find some subjects

722.16 --> 725.12
to actually talk about

726.36 --> 732.6800000000001
because I think yeah yesterday whatever

728.279 --> 732.68
everything I said was pretty much it

732.74 --> 737.4590000000001
that's yeah why it was very satisfying

735.6 --> 739.32
also because afterwards I just realized

737.459 --> 740.5189999999999
like yeah I literally just put it all

739.32 --> 743.279
down

740.519 --> 745.82
it's it's complete now

743.279 --> 745.82
so

762.3 --> 765.3199999999999
getting more

765.899 --> 769.519
feedback also yeah

790.26 --> 794.66
yeah it really does seem like

794.88 --> 797.72
the

797.779 --> 804.54
the boosters and all that are flopping

801.959 --> 805.7399999999999
not not flipping as in the table but

804.54 --> 807.959
they are

805.74 --> 810.12
being admitted they're non-functional

807.959 --> 811.8599999999999
now worldwide

810.12 --> 816.019
finally

811.86 --> 816.019
so I'm seeing these Echoes everywhere

823.32 --> 827.82
the underwater volcano erupting a few

825.959 --> 830.399
days ago that looked like a nuke going

827.82 --> 832.32
off uh no that didn't look like a nuke

830.399 --> 835.38
going off

832.32 --> 837.9590000000001
it's just a big explosion it leaves a

835.38 --> 841.98
mushroom cloud right big explosions

837.959 --> 844.68
create mushroom clouds that's not a nuke

841.98 --> 847.32
I mean you could think of it as a nuke

844.68 --> 849.959
which is what a big explosion always was

847.32 --> 852.899
that's the association it's even the

849.959 --> 856.1389999999999
vernaculars like blowing it up big time

852.899 --> 859.079
that's nuking yeah that's what it is

856.139 --> 860.88
just a really big explosion

859.079 --> 862.92
right

860.88 --> 864.18
it's like

862.92 --> 867.3
yeah

864.18 --> 868.92
just like that time Trump ordered like a

867.3 --> 870.54
mother of all bombs to be dropped

868.92 --> 871.74
somewhere in Afghanistan I don't even

870.54 --> 874.74
know what

871.74 --> 876.839
yeah that's kind of like nuking it it's

874.74 --> 879.779
a really big explosion and it's gonna

876.839 --> 882.72
leave a mushroom cloud

879.779 --> 885.54
right that's what it is it always looks

882.72 --> 888.62
like that big volcano explosions yeah

885.54 --> 888.62
that's what it looks like

898.44 --> 903.5
domes are a vegan architecture yeah I'm

900.899 --> 903.5
sure they are

916.98 --> 919.639
all right

927.779 --> 933.18
right but Matthew how you mean that one

930.12 --> 934.32
that was actually like on camera and all

933.18 --> 937.68
that

934.32 --> 940.32
or supposed satellites even caught the

937.68 --> 943.38
Live smoking cloud

940.32 --> 944.88
from the volcanic eruption and all that

943.38 --> 946.5
there was some footage going around

944.88 --> 949.699
about that

946.5 --> 949.699
is that the one you mean

970.32 --> 974.88
I wonder if they trigger some of the

972.3 --> 979.2199999999999
volcanoes on purpose no

974.88 --> 979.22
like what the hell is the point of that

1002.48 --> 1006.6990000000001
just happened to be right above it

1007.519 --> 1015.279
well yeah or it was just a sad Loom

1010.16 --> 1015.279
hanging there as in always hanging there

1015.68 --> 1020.66
I mean how many of these things do there

1018.139 --> 1022.699
need to hang around with cameras

1020.66 --> 1024.9189999999999
for you to be able to cover pretty much

1022.699 --> 1026.6599999999999
anything live as long as it's visually

1024.919 --> 1028.4
big enough

1026.66 --> 1031.459
right

1028.4 --> 1036.2800000000002
like effectively they have satellites

1031.459 --> 1036.28
it's just not an orbiting

1036.319 --> 1039.86
thing

1037.64 --> 1043.5790000000002
it's just hanging there

1039.86 --> 1046.7199999999998
for a very long time doing what a

1043.579 --> 1046.72
satellite is designed to do

1048.02 --> 1052.1
so it's a cell you could say a Seth loon

1050.419 --> 1053.9
and I think they're pretty much

1052.1 --> 1058.34
everywhere now

1053.9 --> 1061.1000000000001
or where they're being allowed to hang

1058.34 --> 1064.24
by the regions

1061.1 --> 1064.24
the regional powers

1066.919 --> 1072.0200000000002
to Pro clear population of their land

1070.58 --> 1074.84
no

1072.02 --> 1077.32
because that would be a war crime that's

1074.84 --> 1077.32
traceable

1085.64 --> 1091.3400000000001
right they're gonna supposedly blow it

1088.52 --> 1094.8799999999999
up with a really big explosion

1091.34 --> 1097.4599999999998
uh that means they will have visited it

1094.88 --> 1101.7990000000002
and installed things and that would be

1097.46 --> 1101.799
in the records it just would be

1105.14 --> 1109.24
that that's like no

1116.0 --> 1123.14
hey but if you want to become fully

1119.919 --> 1126.679
insanely paranoid then you could think

1123.14 --> 1129.74
that anything that happens ever is all

1126.679 --> 1132.98
secretly man done yeah you could think

1129.74 --> 1136.1
that and drive yourself completely ape

1132.98 --> 1138.98
[ __ ] insane without recovery possibility

1136.1 --> 1142.039
if you really like to or you could just

1138.98 --> 1145.1200000000001
stay a little bit sober and realize that

1142.039 --> 1145.12
that's ridiculous

1165.62 --> 1171.4399999999998
right it doesn't even work

1168.32 --> 1172.3999999999999
how are you gonna clear regions of

1171.44 --> 1175.16
people

1172.4 --> 1177.8600000000001
by letting a natural disaster strike it

1175.16 --> 1179.3600000000001
all it's going to do is turn it into a

1177.86 --> 1181.82
[ __ ] you're not gonna get the people

1179.36 --> 1184.76
away right the only way to actually do

1181.82 --> 1186.02
that is to then afterward just murder

1184.76 --> 1188.78
them

1186.02 --> 1190.28
yeah so it's gonna be exposed anyway you

1188.78 --> 1194.26
can't do that sort of thing a secret

1190.28 --> 1194.26
it's just completely irrational

1194.539 --> 1200.14
if you're gonna do that it's gonna be

1196.46 --> 1200.14
traced you're gonna be [ __ ]

1205.94 --> 1213.799
yeah yeah like 911 yeah but 911 was a

1209.72 --> 1216.02
complete and utter stage mock mocking

1213.799 --> 1220.039
situation

1216.02 --> 1223.6399999999999
it's not to clear the area it's there to

1220.039 --> 1225.98
on purpose traumatize a people to play

1223.64 --> 1228.44
into a war game

1225.98 --> 1231.64
it's called a false flag

1228.44 --> 1231.64
that's what that was

1231.679 --> 1235.88
is very different it didn't clear the

1234.98 --> 1240.1
region

1235.88 --> 1240.1000000000001
it just helped to start a war

1258.74 --> 1265.24
no it's not a nuke it's not a nuke and

1261.44 --> 1265.24
to suggest it is ridiculous

1265.52 --> 1269.6
first off they don't exist

1268.159 --> 1273.0800000000002
second off

1269.6 --> 1275.8999999999999
it would be a lot of effort to actually

1273.08 --> 1280.8799999999999
have it blow up like that

1275.9 --> 1284.98
this is like no why why why it makes no

1280.88 --> 1284.98
[ __ ] sense like at all

1304.7 --> 1310.179
right then report from Iron Mountain

1306.5 --> 1310.179
what's that kind of report that's

1326.84 --> 1330.9189999999999
all right get Matthew Hall you only said

1328.94 --> 1332.419
it looked like a right yeah because it

1330.919 --> 1336.38
isn't

1332.419 --> 1339.1000000000001
glad you uh were seeing straight

1336.38 --> 1339.1000000000001
on that

1339.44 --> 1345.919
they would have to use yeah or or hey

1342.74 --> 1350.24
the other Andrew or the volcano just

1345.919 --> 1352.76
blew up yeah or the volcano just blew up

1350.24 --> 1355.159
have you ever considered that maybe the

1352.76 --> 1357.08
volcano just blew up

1355.159 --> 1360.74
ever thought about that

1357.08 --> 1365.1999999999998
that maybe it's a natural event

1360.74 --> 1365.2
that a volcano can just blow up

1370.76 --> 1378.18
future plans agenda for the world blah

1375.559 --> 1381.42
uh

1378.18 --> 1381.42
[Music]

1384.44 --> 1389.3600000000001
uh look hey hey guys guys if you're on

1387.559 --> 1392.1789999999999
to some if you really think that's real

1389.36 --> 1393.62
well we better do some deep searching

1392.179 --> 1396.0800000000002
then

1393.62 --> 1398.0
because yeah that means there would be

1396.08 --> 1401.78
teams

1398.0 --> 1404.24
going around to volcanic sites

1401.78 --> 1405.74
one by one and then rigging them to

1404.24 --> 1408.02
explode yeah

1405.74 --> 1410.84
that would be traceable

1408.02 --> 1414.5
that would be on record that hey yeah

1410.84 --> 1415.9399999999998
there's like people going from volcano

1414.5 --> 1417.919
to volcano

1415.94 --> 1420.44
and each and every one of them then

1417.919 --> 1423.919
proceeds to blow up

1420.44 --> 1426.2
right if that's true get some evidence I

1423.919 --> 1429.0800000000002
don't want to hear about it until you

1426.2 --> 1431.659
actually present some evidence for that

1429.08 --> 1435.1589999999999
because it is absolutely outrageous it's

1431.659 --> 1435.159
beyond war criminal

1440.419 --> 1444.74
so I don't want to talk about that

1442.64 --> 1447.7990000000002
because I have no proof for that it

1444.74 --> 1452.0
seems absolutely ridiculous

1447.799 --> 1454.12
and there would be proof of it so go get

1452.0 --> 1454.12
it

1463.159 --> 1467.44
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

1472.7 --> 1478.22
there's a lot of volcanoes going off

1474.86 --> 1480.02
recently oh really is there you mean

1478.22 --> 1482.659
like always

1480.02 --> 1486.039
as in always during my entire life

1482.659 --> 1486.0390000000002
volcanoes go off

1486.32 --> 1490.7
yeah

1487.46 --> 1494.059
it's like every few years

1490.7 --> 1496.279
every time every single time there is no

1494.059 --> 1498.799
pause don't you understand that there is

1496.279 --> 1501.02
no pause to volcanic explosion activity

1498.799 --> 1503.6589999999999
and all that breaking open

1501.02 --> 1506.84
it always happens constantly

1503.659 --> 1509.1200000000001
everywhere yeah we just know about it

1506.84 --> 1510.86
because now there's media

1509.12 --> 1512.539
telling us where it's happening

1510.86 --> 1515.6589999999999
constantly

1512.539 --> 1518.6
we're like a hundred years ago

1515.659 --> 1519.8600000000001
yeah it was we would know about it if it

1518.6 --> 1522.5
was close

1519.86 --> 1526.279
or then we wouldn't hear rumors about it

1522.5 --> 1528.08
from Far distant lands

1526.279 --> 1534.039
and believe it or not

1528.08 --> 1534.039
right now we just know it's all the time

1534.559 --> 1541.52
so yeah no not oh recently no all the

1538.159 --> 1545.1200000000001
time all the time all the time volcanoes

1541.52 --> 1547.6
erupt all the time you get it all the

1545.12 --> 1547.6
time

1549.14 --> 1555.14
doesn't require a specialist team to go

1552.38 --> 1559.1200000000001
around and rig them to explode

1555.14 --> 1559.1200000000001
this is absolutely ridiculous

1565.53 --> 1568.6399999999999
[Music]

1577.1 --> 1584.02
if you're going to insert some highly

1580.58 --> 1587.539
highly destructive paranoid

1584.02 --> 1590.4189999999999
idea which in this case would be

1587.539 --> 1591.799
like a really ridiculous conspiracy

1590.419 --> 1594.38
theory

1591.799 --> 1596.96
which motivation would be literally to

1594.38 --> 1599.2990000000002
destroy everything on a grand scale to

1596.96 --> 1601.94
somehow take control well then you

1599.299 --> 1604.94
better well damn provide some evidence

1601.94 --> 1607.1000000000001
for that that's actually feasible and

1604.94 --> 1609.98
not just blabber around

1607.1 --> 1611.6589999999999
savagely paranoid rumors

1609.98 --> 1613.7
okay

1611.659 --> 1616.0590000000002
I'm getting a bit agitated here the

1613.7 --> 1616.059
other Andrew

1621.26 --> 1623.44
foreign

1629.059 --> 1635.24
because if that's real you would find

1632.24 --> 1637.94
evidence you would have data to put

1635.24 --> 1640.84
together so go and do it then

1637.94 --> 1640.8400000000001
or drop it

1642.38 --> 1644.919
anyway

1657.62 --> 1662.02
waiting for better weather and Light

1660.32 --> 1666.6399999999999
right now

1662.02 --> 1666.6399999999999
north of the equator we all are

1667.58 --> 1670.24
I mean

1670.7 --> 1674.8400000000001
just a few months away in springtime's

1673.159 --> 1677.1200000000001
back

1674.84 --> 1680.0
I'm already enjoying the return of the

1677.12 --> 1681.08
light like I can literally notice more

1680.0 --> 1682.58
light

1681.08 --> 1684.86
now

1682.58 --> 1688.1
then a month ago

1684.86 --> 1692.02
when it was roughly at its minimum

1688.1 --> 1692.02
roughly or exactly

1702.2 --> 1705.5
all right so yeah sorry to go hard on

1704.779 --> 1708.08
you

1705.5 --> 1710.419
other Andrew it's just that

1708.08 --> 1713.4189999999999
like when there's a highly paranoid

1710.419 --> 1717.6200000000001
those types of ideas

1713.419 --> 1720.0800000000002
we don't need more paranoia

1717.62 --> 1722.4189999999999
sounds a bit weird right with me doing

1720.08 --> 1725.059
what I do sometimes

1722.419 --> 1727.3400000000001
getting all really pissed off

1725.059 --> 1730.399
well that's paranoia that's meant for

1727.34 --> 1733.52
his very specific Target group

1730.399 --> 1735.799
that deserves to be eradicated

1733.52 --> 1737.4189999999999
right

1735.799 --> 1741.559
they deserve that

1737.419 --> 1745.7
we and the people in the world don't

1741.559 --> 1749.1789999999999
deserve more paranoid ideas of how we

1745.7 --> 1752.779
are all being devilishly destroyed right

1749.179 --> 1755.8400000000001
there's already enough real things out

1752.779 --> 1762.22
there happening we don't need to invent

1755.84 --> 1762.22
more devilish haunting Visions okay

1762.26 --> 1767.72
so if you're going to do that you better

1764.659 --> 1770.419
will damn well provide some evidence

1767.72 --> 1774.08
to back it

1770.419 --> 1777.26
like actual recorded evidence

1774.08 --> 1778.22
like look yeah a team was spotted right

1777.26 --> 1780.3799999999999
there

1778.22 --> 1782.48
they were not telling what they were

1780.38 --> 1784.7600000000002
doing

1782.48 --> 1786.98
they were Drilling in the side of the

1784.76 --> 1788.84
volcano right that would be suspicious

1786.98 --> 1792.22
right

1788.84 --> 1792.22
that would be a clue

1800.059 --> 1807.22
anyway

1802.58 --> 1807.22
uh just projecting yeah

1807.74 --> 1813.32
just try not to do that

1810.26 --> 1816.02
there's enough paranoia in the world

1813.32 --> 1819.5
about real things we don't need more

1816.02 --> 1822.62
paranoia about fictional things right

1819.5 --> 1825.919
falls into the same category as oh no a

1822.62 --> 1829.399
meteor just missed us missed Earth again

1825.919 --> 1831.919
oh we're so lucky on these meteors and

1829.399 --> 1835.279
they keep just missing us could be

1831.919 --> 1838.159
destroyed any second now

1835.279 --> 1840.5
it's about on that level

1838.159 --> 1843.2
not not entirely because that's just

1840.5 --> 1845.539
completely ridiculous

1843.2 --> 1847.82
it's more harmless because that could

1845.539 --> 1850.399
never happen

1847.82 --> 1852.86
the entire premise based on the medium

1850.399 --> 1855.02
is completely fictional

1852.86 --> 1856.9399999999998
right

1855.02 --> 1859.46
and yeah a bunch of

1856.94 --> 1862.5800000000002
elitist

1859.46 --> 1865.1000000000001
Black Ops Team going around and rigging

1862.58 --> 1867.74
volcanoes to blow up yeah that could

1865.1 --> 1870.6789999999999
technically happen right but it would

1867.74 --> 1873.6200000000001
leave some evidence

1870.679 --> 1876.519
so let's not assume that to be the case

1873.62 --> 1876.5189999999998
per default

1876.919 --> 1881.26
got enough misery out there as it is

1896.419 --> 1900.519
okay Lydia logs you ever

1902.84 --> 1906.82
well what kind of Channel you have

1912.32 --> 1918.039
check out your channel I keep forgetting

1914.6 --> 1918.039
that that's an option these days

1919.22 --> 1921.82
oh

1921.919 --> 1928.6000000000001
oh you don't really have any activity

1925.1 --> 1928.6
just yet all right

1965.24 --> 1969.7
all right yeah Lydia logs uh

1969.86 --> 1974.9599999999998
yeah if you just made an account that's

1972.32 --> 1977.48
all fine it's just that we're all highly

1974.96 --> 1980.6000000000001
suspicious of troll infiltrators because

1977.48 --> 1983.3600000000001
they literally come here every day

1980.6 --> 1986.779
to try to get

1983.36 --> 1990.62
under to literally infiltrate

1986.779 --> 1994.46
pretend to be a regular person

1990.62 --> 1997.1
and then like create sickness in the

1994.46 --> 1999.22
chat so yeah we're all very suspicious

1997.1 --> 2003.299
of newcomers

1999.22 --> 2003.299
very very suspicious

2005.44 --> 2010.8400000000001
right doesn't mean that you're not

2007.779 --> 2014.74
allowed in if you're like if you just

2010.84 --> 2018.22
made your account but if your tone is

2014.74 --> 2020.98
just slightly off in any way

2018.22 --> 2026.519
the chances you will get banned

2020.98 --> 2026.519
quickly is about 95 percent

2026.679 --> 2032.3200000000002
right you wouldn't even have to actively

2029.5 --> 2034.179
insult anybody it's just that if your

2032.32 --> 2036.519
tone is off you're just a new account

2034.179 --> 2038.14
you're probably gonna get banned really

2036.519 --> 2040.6
quickly

2038.14 --> 2042.3990000000001
so that's just how it works because yeah

2040.6 --> 2044.86
there's some people out there that just

2042.399 --> 2047.08
really don't like me

2044.86 --> 2049.839
they really don't like what I do and

2047.08 --> 2051.8199999999997
that I can do what I do and that I keep

2049.839 --> 2055.96
doing what I do

2051.82 --> 2057.8990000000003
so they made it their life's work to try

2055.96 --> 2060.52
to somehow

2057.899 --> 2062.6189999999997
demotivate me and stop me from doing

2060.52 --> 2066.04
what I do

2062.619 --> 2068.679
I don't even understand really why

2066.04 --> 2070.7799999999997
but they do

2068.679 --> 2074.399
and they make soccer counts all the time

2070.78 --> 2074.3990000000003
that we then have to delete

2080.859 --> 2087.0989999999997
hmm oh look at that wow that cleared up

2085.48 --> 2089.919
really quick

2087.099 --> 2093.179
look at that nice

2089.919 --> 2093.179
nice blue sky

2107.619 --> 2115.42
I cannot believe how unbelievably in

2112.3 --> 2118.02
your face holographic the sunlight

2115.42 --> 2118.02
really is

2118.3 --> 2123.579
you know

2120.88 --> 2125.8
it took me a long time to even realize

2123.579 --> 2128.8590000000004
that's the case

2125.8 --> 2132.119
and I'm going to say like I am basically

2128.859 --> 2135.0989999999997
moving beyond flat Earth debate

2132.119 --> 2139.3
technically correct safe territory now

2135.099 --> 2143.1400000000003
I'm just saying no I can literally see

2139.3 --> 2148.1800000000003
that the light in itself is holographic

2143.14 --> 2148.18
because it doesn't work anything

2148.48 --> 2153.82
like regular other types of light and by

2151.359 --> 2157.24
the way same goes for the moon it's also

2153.82 --> 2161.46
holographic I can see the difference I

2157.24 --> 2164.9799999999996
can see that it doesn't shine the same

2161.46 --> 2166.54
at all like nothing nothing like

2164.98 --> 2169.2400000000002
man-made light

2166.54 --> 2172.24
it's so different and I'm looking at

2169.24 --> 2176.3799999999997
that and just the way the light

2172.24 --> 2181.4199999999996
comes into my eyes it feels different

2176.38 --> 2185.7000000000003
it's not light emanating from an actual

2181.42 --> 2185.7000000000003
physical Source in a literal place

2186.7 --> 2190.0
motion

2188.339 --> 2192.839
affects it

2190.0 --> 2197.88
just everything affects the entire

2192.839 --> 2197.88
output of that apparent sunlight

2198.04 --> 2204.52
then it is miraculous to feel it the

2201.88 --> 2206.98
feel and realize now this is different

2204.52 --> 2209.44
light it's completely different and it

2206.98 --> 2212.619
looks really beautiful

2209.44 --> 2215.02
but it is completely different

2212.619 --> 2218.02
from regular man-made life

2215.02 --> 2221.68
just completely different

2218.02 --> 2224.2
two sons no no one son

2221.68 --> 2228.46
and it's holographic

2224.2 --> 2230.68
as in there is no one Sun

2228.46 --> 2233.7400000000002
there is no sun

2230.68 --> 2235.24
but there is a sun Apparition to every

2233.74 --> 2238.66
Observer

2235.24 --> 2241.4799999999996
within the time span that it should be

2238.66 --> 2244.72
within visual range

2241.48 --> 2248.4
angular wise for the person based on the

2244.72 --> 2248.3999999999996
yeah on the sky clock

2249.4 --> 2255.4
so how can you tell the difference

2251.98 --> 2257.8
I see it I see the difference it looks

2255.4 --> 2260.2000000000003
different

2257.8 --> 2262.9
it's very different light

2260.2 --> 2264.5789999999997
and there's all kinds of light and lamps

2262.9 --> 2266.6800000000003
I've seen

2264.579 --> 2270.52
effects

2266.68 --> 2273.8799999999997
with lamps it's all different

2270.52 --> 2276.7
it's all all man-made light is just

2273.88 --> 2279.579
straightforward light it's right there

2276.7 --> 2281.859
you could trace back

2279.579 --> 2284.5600000000004
it you could trace it back oh very

2281.859 --> 2288.66
easily how it scatters how it reflects

2284.56 --> 2288.66
this light is something else

2291.46 --> 2298.5
like nothing is this bright at such an

2295.54 --> 2298.5
apparent distance

2298.599 --> 2303.599
and it just seems like Prismatic to me

2307.599 --> 2314.7000000000003
like direct unobstructed sunlight is

2310.839 --> 2314.7
just is something else

2316.54 --> 2326.38
yeah sunlight than science sun light

2321.9 --> 2328.48
light specifically from the Sun The

2326.38 --> 2333.78
Apparition we see

2328.48 --> 2333.78
that has been identified named the Sun

2335.98 --> 2341.619
yeah that thing that is not actually a

2339.339 --> 2344.2
thing that is not in any actual position

2341.619 --> 2347.56
there's only in an angular

2344.2 --> 2349.2999999999997
position in relation to an observer

2347.56 --> 2352.42
that thing

2349.3 --> 2355.1800000000003
that we see and the light that comes

2352.42 --> 2358.1800000000003
from that position with the apparent

2355.18 --> 2360.7
blinding sun disk at the focal point

2358.18 --> 2362.7999999999997
from where the direction of the light

2360.7 --> 2365.74
comes in relation to the Observer

2362.8 --> 2369.1600000000003
because it's not actually coming from an

2365.74 --> 2372.52
object in a position in space

2369.16 --> 2375.0989999999997
within the realm either like it's not

2372.52 --> 2378.18
coming from an object in the space

2375.099 --> 2378.1800000000003
within the realm

2378.4 --> 2383.619
we see it here

2380.859 --> 2387.2799999999997
it's not an object that's physically

2383.619 --> 2390.6600000000003
there from which the light comes

2387.28 --> 2390.6600000000003
that's not what we're seeing

2392.88 --> 2400.54
different to what different to man-made

2396.4 --> 2403.96
lamps lamps candles any form of man-made

2400.54 --> 2406.54
local light is always different you just

2403.96 --> 2409.38
cannot compare it

2406.54 --> 2409.38
completely different

2411.339 --> 2417.04
oh how do you explain yeah that's a

2414.04 --> 2418.3
rival it arrives it's not radiation heat

2417.04 --> 2421.119
dance science

2418.3 --> 2424.6600000000003
there's no proximity heat involved it's

2421.119 --> 2427.48
light being absorbed arriving

2424.66 --> 2429.94
and then as it is being absorbed it

2427.48 --> 2433.26
creates the heat yeah Holograms do emit

2429.94 --> 2433.26
heat yes they do

2438.28 --> 2442.0
this is you're you don't know what the

2440.5 --> 2445.66
[ __ ] you're talking about

2442.0 --> 2448.06
you're just another ball [ __ ] are you

2445.66 --> 2451.0
you are because they all talk the same

2448.06 --> 2454.0
you all talk the same you always say the

2451.0 --> 2456.22
same [ __ ] every single [ __ ] time the

2454.0 --> 2460.24
subject comes up it's like a fully

2456.22 --> 2461.2599999999998
automated robotic response every single

2460.24 --> 2464.0989999999997
time

2461.26 --> 2468.099
the same remarks the same questions

2464.099 --> 2469.599
always the same always ending up not

2468.099 --> 2472.92
understanding

2469.599 --> 2472.92
every single time

2473.98 --> 2479.079
there's still heat in proximity yeah

2475.9 --> 2481.0
well not with the sun buddy huh not with

2479.079 --> 2482.7400000000002
the sun no it's not you don't have

2481.0 --> 2485.38
evidence for that

2482.74 --> 2489.4599999999996
why didn't you approach it and then

2485.38 --> 2490.6600000000003
measure yeah measure with the actual

2489.46 --> 2492.28
approach here you're going to have to

2490.66 --> 2494.319
approach it first let's see what happens

2492.28 --> 2497.5
oh you're not gonna approach it because

2494.319 --> 2500.2599999999998
it moves with the Observer you can't

2497.5 --> 2503.2
approach it yeah if you can't approach

2500.26 --> 2506.3390000000004
something then you can't prove proximity

2503.2 --> 2509.68
heat either you can prove it radiates

2506.339 --> 2512.92
like a radiator heat because you can't

2509.68 --> 2515.2
get closer to it in order to absorb more

2512.92 --> 2516.88
of that proximity Heat

2515.2 --> 2519.9399999999996
you don't have evidence for that

2516.88 --> 2523.839
whatsoever there is no evidence for that

2519.94 --> 2527.619
it's only stupid models NASA claims of

2523.839 --> 2530.619
satellites blah blah blah CGI [ __ ]

2527.619 --> 2533.6800000000003
there is no evidence there is no

2530.619 --> 2536.7400000000002
evidence there is no evidence there's no

2533.68 --> 2538.06
evidence the sun is an object you can

2536.74 --> 2541.24
approach it

2538.06 --> 2545.74
can get closer you can't show me

2541.24 --> 2549.2799999999997
based in actual footage angular size

2545.74 --> 2553.0
change due to proximity change

2549.28 --> 2555.94
it's not an object you can get closer to

2553.0 --> 2557.56
you can get closer in order to absorb

2555.94 --> 2559.599
proximity Heat

2557.56 --> 2561.4
to see it increase because you can't

2559.599 --> 2564.579
approach it because it's not an object

2561.4 --> 2566.7400000000002
it's a hologram a holler graphic

2564.579 --> 2570.4
phenomenon

2566.74 --> 2572.68
a Celestial light

2570.4 --> 2575.56
that's what it is it's what it always

2572.68 --> 2577.66
was it's what the Ancients said

2575.56 --> 2580.359
is what it is

2577.66 --> 2584.0989999999997
you gotta deal with it because that

2580.359 --> 2587.5
fiery gassy ball in a vacuum supposedly

2584.099 --> 2588.96
nuclear whatever is the most [ __ ]

2587.5 --> 2591.64
lie

2588.96 --> 2594.4
Humanity's ever been subjected to about

2591.64 --> 2598.42
the celestial lights yeah it's a

2594.4 --> 2599.8
Monumental lie it's a satanic Monumental

2598.42 --> 2602.7400000000002
plant

2599.8 --> 2606.3590000000004
an idea planted in your head and now you

2602.74 --> 2609.64
you can't think of it beyond that stupid

2606.359 --> 2611.859
idiotic assertion

2609.64 --> 2614.2
it's repeated over and over and over and

2611.859 --> 2617.0789999999997
over again and now you can't even unsee

2614.2 --> 2619.96
that [ __ ] now you gotta constantly oh

2617.079 --> 2623.04
but how can whatever data is coming my

2619.96 --> 2627.64
way how can I adapt it and rearrange it

2623.04 --> 2629.079
to enforce that stupid ball of gas fiery

2627.64 --> 2633.1189999999997
sun again

2629.079 --> 2633.119
which was always a lie

2644.98 --> 2649.079
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here

2651.52 --> 2657.16
I've done my rant I'm not willing to

2654.28 --> 2658.78
waste more time on some stupid ass troll

2657.16 --> 2660.94
piece of [ __ ]

2658.78 --> 2663.2200000000003
that just won't get it because he's

2660.94 --> 2665.2000000000003
[ __ ] he doesn't pay attention

2663.22 --> 2668.4599999999996
because I've been talking about this

2665.2 --> 2668.46
[ __ ] for six years

2668.859 --> 2673.54
you still don't get it well get the [ __ ]

2671.8 --> 2675.52
out of here then

2673.54 --> 2678.9
why don't you go look up what I'm

2675.52 --> 2681.46
talking about why don't you ask actual

2678.9 --> 2685.42
inquiry-based questions instead of just

2681.46 --> 2689.079
whining directly scratch it away scratch

2685.42 --> 2691.66
it away so only your stupid little Globe

2689.079 --> 2693.46
model fiery Sun remains

2691.66 --> 2694.96
yeah because you don't want to know what

2693.46 --> 2696.52
it is you don't want to know because

2694.96 --> 2698.92
you're weak

2696.52 --> 2701.2
you're weak and easily programmed and

2698.92 --> 2704.859
now you don't want to relinquish that

2701.2 --> 2707.7999999999997
programming that satanic lie that was

2704.859 --> 2711.4
systematically implanted in you through

2707.8 --> 2713.92
school books and media and the whole

2711.4 --> 2715.599
heliocentric garbage system yeah you

2713.92 --> 2717.94
don't want to relinquish it well get the

2715.599 --> 2721.839
[ __ ] out of here then because it is a

2717.94 --> 2723.76
lie provably it's a lie yeah

2721.839 --> 2727.54
I'm just trying to figure out what it

2723.76 --> 2731.76
really is and my conclusions have let me

2727.54 --> 2731.7599999999998
to realize it's holographic

2738.579 --> 2743.6800000000003
what resources do you think could be

2741.76 --> 2746.079
used to research the holographic Sun

2743.68 --> 2750.1189999999997
well everything

2746.079 --> 2750.119
we're already doing it right

2752.26 --> 2760.5400000000004
it's just figure out its traits

2755.98 --> 2763.2400000000002
right and hey if you insist if you

2760.54 --> 2766.54
insist like we must

2763.24 --> 2769.54
we must move Beyond well yeah well then

2766.54 --> 2772.72
try to create a simulator in which you

2769.54 --> 2774.64
can create the holographic effect in a

2772.72 --> 2777.22
small scale and I'm talking a really

2774.64 --> 2779.6189999999997
small scale

2777.22 --> 2784.4199999999996
like within a

2779.619 --> 2789.04
cubic meter space inside

2784.42 --> 2791.98
that you would not see from the outside

2789.04 --> 2795.16
only from the inside because it is

2791.98 --> 2800.4
holographic it's only there

2795.16 --> 2800.3999999999996
to us as observers because we are here

2800.68 --> 2806.98
yeah if you go there

2803.8 --> 2809.079
it isn't there anymore

2806.98 --> 2812.319
yeah so that means if you're gonna

2809.079 --> 2815.92
create an emulator to try to mimic the

2812.319 --> 2818.2
holographic Celestial effect

2815.92 --> 2821.5
it's going to have to work in a way

2818.2 --> 2823.2999999999997
where you have a micro camera inside a

2821.5 --> 2827.14
perimeter where the effect is created

2823.3 --> 2831.2200000000003
where it would look just like this

2827.14 --> 2833.5
on a micro scale but if you look outside

2831.22 --> 2836.2
you wouldn't see it

2833.5 --> 2839.14
you literally would not see the sun

2836.2 --> 2841.96
effect you might see light

2839.14 --> 2844.359
arriving at the bottom plate where the

2841.96 --> 2847.18
camera is perhaps

2844.359 --> 2850.5989999999997
but you would not see a Celestial

2847.18 --> 2855.22
Apparition from the outside because it's

2850.599 --> 2857.8590000000004
only visible here at ground level that's

2855.22 --> 2860.98
how it's designed to appear the

2857.859 --> 2863.22
celestial lights appear to us in a demi

2860.98 --> 2863.22
sphere

2863.5 --> 2869.8
at ground level that's where we see it

2866.8 --> 2872.2000000000003
the way it is that's why when you go up

2869.8 --> 2875.6800000000003
really really high it's not even

2872.2 --> 2878.7999999999997
contestable the Stars just disappear

2875.68 --> 2883.2999999999997
yeah there's no explanation from that

2878.8 --> 2886.54
grounded in physically biased model for

2883.3 --> 2889.0
the celestials you cannot

2886.54 --> 2891.64
cannot explain that

2889.0 --> 2894.18
in any logical way anyway

2891.64 --> 2894.18
right

2894.579 --> 2899.1400000000003
it's holographic the data is already

2897.579 --> 2902.7400000000002
there

2899.14 --> 2907.359
I'm not gonna make some tech Gadget just

2902.74 --> 2910.18
to satisfy your curiosity about that

2907.359 --> 2912.5789999999997
I know it's not physical because all the

2910.18 --> 2915.7599999999998
evidence for that is missing

2912.579 --> 2917.26
the sun isn't a physical object in

2915.76 --> 2921.0400000000004
physical space

2917.26 --> 2924.88
it's a light based Apparition a

2921.04 --> 2924.88
holographic phenomenon

2927.4 --> 2929.64
foreign

2941.74 --> 2947.68
no no Matthew oh I did say that I am

2944.98 --> 2949.78
saying the sun is holographic it is a

2947.68 --> 2951.8799999999997
hologram effectively it's just not a

2949.78 --> 2954.599
hologram that we can make

2951.88 --> 2957.52
yeah not that I know of because

2954.599 --> 2961.6600000000003
Holograms the way the technology has

2957.52 --> 2963.88
been developed is actually to create

2961.66 --> 2966.7599999999998
a visual apparition

2963.88 --> 2970.059
that appears to be in a specific

2966.76 --> 2972.579
position right it it actually does

2970.059 --> 2975.2200000000003
appear to be there you can move around

2972.579 --> 2978.52
it and it seems like it's a physical

2975.22 --> 2982.5989999999997
literal object that's how Holograms

2978.52 --> 2986.46
technology are made here on Earth by

2982.599 --> 2989.4
humans we can make that well this thing

2986.46 --> 2993.16
this Celestial light is not like that

2989.4 --> 2996.54
it's like that but it's not like that

2993.16 --> 3001.319
because it isn't in a specific position

2996.54 --> 3005.22
it's a universal apparition

3001.319 --> 3007.619
that appears in specific relation to the

3005.22 --> 3011.3999999999996
Observer

3007.619 --> 3014.46
yeah not in like a box

3011.4 --> 3017.2200000000003
it's right there in the box right it

3014.46 --> 3018.78
looks like it's there's a thing there it

3017.22 --> 3020.7
could move around it no it's not like

3018.78 --> 3024.8390000000004
that

3020.7 --> 3027.0
unless we are the box and we are in what

3024.839 --> 3028.38
would be a giant Celestial hologram

3027.0 --> 3030.96
generator

3028.38 --> 3033.2400000000002
right maybe maybe thinking about it like

3030.96 --> 3036.9
that could assist you with somewhat in

3033.24 --> 3040.5
tackling the understanding of what it is

3036.9 --> 3043.619
that helps right

3040.5 --> 3046.38
but it is not an object in a literal

3043.619 --> 3048.42
position it's not a a lamp

3046.38 --> 3052.02
[Music]

3048.42 --> 3054.7200000000003
or a some kind of a light

3052.02 --> 3056.339
like a technological device in its

3054.72 --> 3057.9599999999996
position that's not what it is there's

3056.339 --> 3062.04
no evidence for it there's no evidence

3057.96 --> 3065.18
for a reflector there is no evidence for

3062.04 --> 3067.88
any specific euclidean based position

3065.18 --> 3070.6189999999997
from which all that light energy

3067.88 --> 3071.6400000000003
emanates in order to create this

3070.619 --> 3075.48
apparition

3071.64 --> 3077.8799999999997
there is no Source Point traceable a

3075.48 --> 3079.619
point that's actually in euclidean space

3077.88 --> 3082.079
you can't trace it it's not there

3079.619 --> 3085.1400000000003
there's no evidence for it there's a lot

3082.079 --> 3087.3
of blabbering around rumors oh it's not

3085.14 --> 3090.54
the real song There's an actual hidden

3087.3 --> 3093.78
center it's a reflection of the Dome the

3090.54 --> 3096.599
Dome it's all [ __ ] stories

3093.78 --> 3099.9
because you can't grasp it

3096.599 --> 3102.48
she can't handle not grasping it it's

3099.9 --> 3105.359
physicality assumption bias oh you need

3102.48 --> 3108.319
it to be it has to be somewhere

3105.359 --> 3112.44
otherwise I won't under understand

3108.319 --> 3116.339
oh Patty human oh you're you're a human

3112.44 --> 3118.8
psyche is failing you in the face of

3116.339 --> 3120.7799999999997
God's glorious design of this realm

3118.8 --> 3124.5
that's what's happening and you can't

3120.78 --> 3129.78
face it your mind can't wrap around that

3124.5 --> 3131.94
it just isn't a [ __ ] object it just

3129.78 --> 3134.96
isn't

3131.94 --> 3134.96
deal with it

3136.94 --> 3140.19
[Music]

3143.55 --> 3149.1800000000003
[Music]

3146.46 --> 3149.18
ah

3150.78 --> 3155.1600000000003
that fur moment creates yeah I see there

3153.0 --> 3157.5
we've got more blabbering assertions I

3155.16 --> 3160.5589999999997
believe this creates it that creates it

3157.5 --> 3164.22
oh really yeah yeah sure oh it's it's

3160.559 --> 3167.599
reflecting from the outside why did you

3164.22 --> 3171.8999999999996
[ __ ] lay down some damn evidence

3167.599 --> 3174.9
in the world evidence not some stupid

3171.9 --> 3176.88
little piece of glass and then shining a

3174.9 --> 3179.3
light on that thinking like that proves

3176.88 --> 3183.839
any [ __ ] thing about what that is

3179.3 --> 3187.92
nothing you can make is like that don't

3183.839 --> 3188.88
you get it nothing you can make is like

3187.92 --> 3192.9
that

3188.88 --> 3196.1400000000003
stop your physicality assumption bias

3192.9 --> 3199.98
from creating some stupid made-up little

3196.14 --> 3201.1189999999997
model to explain it away because you

3199.98 --> 3205.46
can't

3201.119 --> 3208.5
you can't it's not a light in a physical

3205.46 --> 3212.599
literal position in this realm and

3208.5 --> 3212.599
there's nothing you can do about it

3219.18 --> 3225.5
have you seen video of the sun between

3222.42 --> 3225.5
you and the clouds

3225.859 --> 3230.0989999999997
uh yeah I've seen plenty of things I've

3228.96 --> 3232.94
seen

3230.099 --> 3232.94
the Sun

3233.64 --> 3241.2
shining onto a cloud that would then

3236.28 --> 3244.3190000000004
cast a shadow on a cloud above that

3241.2 --> 3247.5589999999997
cloud yeah that's what I've seen you

3244.319 --> 3249.0589999999997
know how I explain that

3247.559 --> 3251.94
it's very easy

3249.059 --> 3253.5
it's an apparition it's not literally in

3251.94 --> 3256.819
a position but in relation to the

3253.5 --> 3261.66
Observer The Apparition appears

3256.819 --> 3263.819
appears in that actual location

3261.66 --> 3266.04
which it isn't literally because if you

3263.819 --> 3268.98
go there it's not there anymore

3266.04 --> 3272.4
but in relation to the Observer where

3268.98 --> 3276.02
the he is where I was

3272.4 --> 3279.359
it is right there underneath that cloud

3276.02 --> 3282.9
shining onto the cloud which casts a

3279.359 --> 3285.54
shadow onto the cloud physically above

3282.9 --> 3288.839
it because then I on my bike went around

3285.54 --> 3292.46
they could see around the cloud yeah

3288.839 --> 3295.5589999999997
yeah that cloud is literally in space

3292.46 --> 3298.7400000000002
above the other cloud

3295.559 --> 3300.96
physically above it yeah so I saw that

3298.74 --> 3303.72
and that's real

3300.96 --> 3307.619
yeah it means it's a holographic

3303.72 --> 3310.799
Apparition where you see the sun

3307.619 --> 3313.7400000000002
it's not actually there it just appears

3310.799 --> 3315.66
like that because it's a hologram and

3313.74 --> 3318.24
all the light that comes from it and all

3315.66 --> 3321.839
the light that casts Shadows

3318.24 --> 3325.319
on other objects is also holographic

3321.839 --> 3328.319
part of the same effect the entire thing

3325.319 --> 3331.38
you see the entire Shadow play from all

3328.319 --> 3336.54
the light that comes from the sun is One

3331.38 --> 3339.299
Singular holographic effect all of it

3336.54 --> 3342.7799999999997
because none of that light is actually

3339.299 --> 3345.66
coming from any literal position you

3342.78 --> 3348.78
cannot approach it if you move the light

3345.66 --> 3350.3999999999996
and the light play you see changes it's

3348.78 --> 3352.2000000000003
not like that anymore if you're in

3350.4 --> 3357.02
another position you look back at this

3352.2 --> 3357.02
position it's holographic all of it

3364.74 --> 3370.5
that's why it's confusing and I do here

3366.66 --> 3372.1189999999997
a thank you thank you dub Mundo I'm glad

3370.5 --> 3375.359
you're listening

3372.119 --> 3377.099
because it is really frustrating for me

3375.359 --> 3379.799
at times

3377.099 --> 3381.7200000000003
right because this is not like oh a ball

3379.799 --> 3384.0
or issue yeah it is a baller issue of

3381.72 --> 3385.4399999999996
course Ballers are gonna insert their

3384.0 --> 3388.5
nonsense

3385.44 --> 3390.18
hello everybody what our model works

3388.5 --> 3392.52
better [ __ ]

3390.18 --> 3394.98
right but even Flat Earth is it just

3392.52 --> 3397.2
it's so difficult for people to wrap

3394.98 --> 3401.4
their heads around this it's difficult

3397.2 --> 3404.22
for me to keep an oversight

3401.4 --> 3406.799
in trying to explain it

3404.22 --> 3409.5
right it's like yeah how do you even

3406.799 --> 3410.94
freaking explain that to people it's

3409.5 --> 3414.48
really difficult

3410.94 --> 3417.96
it's really really difficult on the mind

3414.48 --> 3421.319
right because it's right there you stare

3417.96 --> 3424.7400000000002
at it every day and it's one of the most

3421.319 --> 3426.96
surreal inexplicable things

3424.74 --> 3429.66
I've ever seen

3426.96 --> 3433.2
something that I cannot miniaturize I

3429.66 --> 3435.7799999999997
cannot make something that emulates its

3433.2 --> 3438.96
effect I can't do it it will never be

3435.78 --> 3441.059
like that I can't make anything like the

3438.96 --> 3444.299
sun in any way

3441.059 --> 3446.94
I might make a light and then oh

3444.299 --> 3449.16
suspense of disbelief I can just believe

3446.94 --> 3450.359
it's the sun yeah but it's not like that

3449.16 --> 3452.64
at all

3450.359 --> 3454.619
nothing like that

3452.64 --> 3459.5
nothing like it

3454.619 --> 3459.5
it's a unique holographic phenomenon

3459.9 --> 3465.119
and it's really difficult on the mind

3462.359 --> 3467.0989999999997
for everybody flat earthers Ballers

3465.119 --> 3468.6600000000003
Ballers just can't grasp it out they're

3467.099 --> 3470.42
just gonna be like oh look at this

3468.66 --> 3475.2
Harwin

3470.42 --> 3477.359
crazy flat earthers yeah I know I know

3475.2 --> 3481.14
you're going to do that I don't give a

3477.359 --> 3483.96
[ __ ] because your model is so screwed I

3481.14 --> 3486.9
don't even have to address you really

3483.96 --> 3489.059
to satisfy anything about what I do

3486.9 --> 3490.98
I don't have to address the ball model

3489.059 --> 3493.02
anymore

3490.98 --> 3494.7
I but I like this sometimes because I

3493.02 --> 3499.14
like to play around

3494.7 --> 3500.7599999999998
right for my personal amusement

3499.14 --> 3504.6189999999997
yeah

3500.76 --> 3504.619
I don't need to though

3504.839 --> 3507.02
foreign

3508.04 --> 3512.819
say the sun is while they're not saying

3510.48 --> 3514.38
anything about it kiwi will say it's a

3512.819 --> 3516.66
luminary

3514.38 --> 3517.6800000000003
it's under the firmament it's in the

3516.66 --> 3520.3799999999997
realm

3517.68 --> 3522.54
and then say like I don't know blah blah

3520.38 --> 3524.7000000000003
blah and Nathan says I don't know what

3522.54 --> 3527.52
it is and I'm not gonna be pinned down

3524.7 --> 3529.5
in saying anything about it

3527.52 --> 3533.16
right that's not what Nathan does Nathan

3529.5 --> 3535.68
just Rams people's heads in that says

3533.16 --> 3537.48
something that's provably wrong

3535.68 --> 3539.339
that's what Nathan likes to do he

3537.48 --> 3542.46
doesn't like to have opinions about

3539.339 --> 3545.4
things that are kind of difficult

3542.46 --> 3547.859
yeah he avoids that

3545.4 --> 3549.2400000000002
and he even makes fun of me for not

3547.859 --> 3551.5789999999997
doing that

3549.24 --> 3554.52
as he did like um what is it last Friday

3551.579 --> 3557.54
show and that's all fine yeah you can

3554.52 --> 3561.599
make fun of good old Arwin for at least

3557.54 --> 3564.72
attempting to figure it out what it is

3561.599 --> 3566.28
that's fine you can do that as long as

3564.72 --> 3569.54
you don't go too far because they don't

3566.28 --> 3569.5400000000004
go rage win on your ass

3569.88 --> 3572.96
on your show

3574.079 --> 3577.2200000000003
and he knows that

3582.74 --> 3585.85
[Music]

3588.54 --> 3594.7799999999997
can say it's 100 yes I can I can

3591.599 --> 3599.04
absolutely say it's 100 holographic yes

3594.78 --> 3600.96
I can it's 100 percent light only based

3599.04 --> 3604.079
yes I can

3600.96 --> 3606.18
dub Mundo absolutely I can I can

3604.079 --> 3609.1800000000003
absolutely say the Sun and all of the

3606.18 --> 3612.4199999999996
celestial lights are 100 percent

3609.18 --> 3615.319
light only based

3612.42 --> 3615.319
yes I can

3623.96 --> 3629.2400000000002
man all this rambling is making me

3626.76 --> 3629.2400000000002
hungry

3630.9 --> 3636.7200000000003
oh

3633.24 --> 3640.5589999999997
where's the proof and it's right there

3636.72 --> 3643.4399999999996
the proof is there is no proof it's not

3640.559 --> 3646.44
light only based because you have no

3643.44 --> 3648.7200000000003
evidence to contrast it with you only

3646.44 --> 3651.0
have presuppositional based assumptions

3648.72 --> 3653.8799999999997
like oh but where does the heat come

3651.0 --> 3656.28
from completely misunderstanding how

3653.88 --> 3658.859
heat even works

3656.28 --> 3661.02
to overlook that yeah there's something

3658.859 --> 3663.299
Beyond radiation heat you can actually

3661.02 --> 3667.44
over long distances

3663.299 --> 3669.66
use lights and lasers to heat things up

3667.44 --> 3672.059
over long distances right it's not a

3669.66 --> 3675.839
proximity thing like it's not even oh

3672.059 --> 3678.059
you go twice as close to that laser and

3675.839 --> 3680.94
then it gets twice as warm no it's the

3678.059 --> 3684.1800000000003
same amount of heat it's trans it's just

3680.94 --> 3686.28
transformed into the light form and then

3684.18 --> 3687.7799999999997
as soon as it's absorbed it turns back

3686.28 --> 3689.4
to heat

3687.78 --> 3691.559
right

3689.4 --> 3694.02
you can transfer heat

3691.559 --> 3696.6600000000003
through light over fast distances it's

3694.02 --> 3698.52
not radiation proximity heat right and

3696.66 --> 3701.64
that's the claim

3698.52 --> 3705.72
that people that try to tackle this

3701.64 --> 3708.299
tried to disprove me move move on to the

3705.72 --> 3709.98
table right that's the argument oh with

3708.299 --> 3712.619
the radiation yeah that's not radiation

3709.98 --> 3714.539
heat you have no proof it is

3712.619 --> 3715.799
at all

3714.539 --> 3718.3190000000004
right

3715.799 --> 3720.5389999999998
because actual radiation heat has a

3718.319 --> 3722.7599999999998
proximity effect you get closer there's

3720.539 --> 3726.42
more heat get further away there's less

3722.76 --> 3730.28
heat yeah that that's not happening here

3726.42 --> 3730.28
that's not what happens with the Sun

3733.14 --> 3738.96
only thing you got is the light being

3735.9 --> 3742.38
absorbed right here on your skin and

3738.96 --> 3744.96
the building on the ground and it's

3742.38 --> 3747.599
there where the heat comes into being

3744.96 --> 3751.14
because it's literally transferred

3747.599 --> 3752.819
through the light not through proximity

3751.14 --> 3758.42
radiation

3752.819 --> 3758.42
yeah at all nothing close to that

3768.119 --> 3772.859
when I say light only based you assume

3770.819 --> 3774.599
they mean there are no sources yeah

3772.859 --> 3778.14
there is no source for it there's no

3774.599 --> 3780.6600000000003
trace of it actually coming from a

3778.14 --> 3784.319
physical point in space that's right

3780.66 --> 3787.44
hey if you find one let me know you know

3784.319 --> 3791.0389999999998
I'd love to see that right I'd go with

3787.44 --> 3793.079
like a PJ aristarcosmo like it's at this

3791.039 --> 3796.079
it's at the center

3793.079 --> 3798.6600000000003
the tree where the big tree was cut down

3796.079 --> 3800.6400000000003
and ah the sun is right over there and

3798.66 --> 3803.0389999999998
they're reflecting and blah blah oh

3800.64 --> 3805.3799999999997
that's really cool dude that's really

3803.039 --> 3809.1600000000003
cool can you show it to me can you show

3805.38 --> 3812.2200000000003
it to me show me the source then right

3809.16 --> 3815.339
because until that point

3812.22 --> 3817.98
it's just an apparition it's manifesting

3815.339 --> 3822.119
the energy is manifesting and therefore

3817.98 --> 3824.46
it can only ever be that the energy is

3822.119 --> 3827.099
being detracted from something

3824.46 --> 3829.2
probably atmospheric electricity the

3827.099 --> 3831.539
electricity that's just ever present in

3829.2 --> 3833.46
the realm is probably drawing that

3831.539 --> 3838.94
energy from something

3833.46 --> 3838.94
but it's not a source based light system

3839.099 --> 3843.9
as far as

3840.78 --> 3846.96
the data goes right unless somebody

3843.9 --> 3849.48
finds aristarchists the source right

3846.96 --> 3852.539
well I'm not even gonna entertain that

3849.48 --> 3855.2400000000002
until somebody actually finds some

3852.539 --> 3859.38
footage based evidence for that some

3855.24 --> 3862.74
real evidence for an actual Source right

3859.38 --> 3865.5
no models no suggests oh it has to be it

3862.74 --> 3868.319
has to be because we can't make anything

3865.5 --> 3871.02
like that so we are going to then

3868.319 --> 3872.94
they can't let it go there must be so no

3871.02 --> 3875.7599999999998
there's no evidence yeah I'm not gonna

3872.94 --> 3878.52
do that I'm gonna say yeah well guess

3875.76 --> 3882.059
what this is this is the light that has

3878.52 --> 3885.18
no Source yeah it's the exception deal

3882.059 --> 3889.2000000000003
with it or find

3885.18 --> 3892.98
how I'm wrong find the source

3889.2 --> 3896.819
yeah not speculate not calculate no it

3892.98 --> 3898.559
has to be no find it find it or shut the

3896.819 --> 3901.619
[ __ ] up

3898.559 --> 3903.6600000000003
there is no source it's not been found

3901.619 --> 3907.319
it isn't anywhere

3903.66 --> 3909.299
it's just the apparitions it they

3907.319 --> 3912.66
manifest in relation to the Observer

3909.299 --> 3917.0389999999998
uniquely like a hologram the energy is

3912.66 --> 3919.68
transferred upon absorption

3917.039 --> 3922.7400000000002
and that's it

3919.68 --> 3925.2599999999998
that's the evidence that's the data that

3922.74 --> 3926.64
is around and it is the only data that

3925.26 --> 3930.539
is around

3926.64 --> 3933.48
now if you can present some data that

3930.539 --> 3936.2990000000004
would change that entire setup I'd love

3933.48 --> 3938.46
to see you see it hear about it you know

3936.299 --> 3941.42
but it better have some actual physical

3938.46 --> 3941.42
proof for that

3944.28 --> 3949.559
I think of sunspots

3947.099 --> 3951.3590000000004
nothing this is just part of the this

3949.559 --> 3956.1600000000003
like what do I think of sunspots well

3951.359 --> 3958.02
what do you think of moon craters right

3956.16 --> 3960.5389999999998
what do you think that's something or is

3958.02 --> 3961.74
it just another part of the holographic

3960.539 --> 3965.1600000000003
apparition

3961.74 --> 3967.0789999999997
it's just light play it's part of how it

3965.16 --> 3970.3999999999996
works

3967.079 --> 3970.4
part of the hologram

3972.24 --> 3976.3799999999997
right and there might even be like

3974.22 --> 3977.5789999999997
correlations it's been speculated I

3976.38 --> 3979.6800000000003
don't know if there's anything to that

3977.579 --> 3981.6600000000003
it might be like oh more sunspot

3979.68 --> 3983.52
activity there's going to be that means

3981.66 --> 3985.44
certain types of changes

3983.52 --> 3988.319
right could be

3985.44 --> 3990.059
but it's still just a holographic

3988.319 --> 3992.16
apparition

3990.059 --> 3994.44
there's nothing actually physically

3992.16 --> 3996.0
happening anywhere it's just part of the

3994.44 --> 3999.78
hologram

3996.0 --> 4003.26
now why is it there I don't know

3999.78 --> 4006.079
why would that a parent not actual thing

4003.26 --> 4008.42
of the Hologram have some kind of a

4006.079 --> 4010.7000000000003
correlating influence

4008.42 --> 4012.2000000000003
with things that happen on Earth I don't

4010.7 --> 4015.14
know why

4012.2 --> 4018.5589999999997
yeah I have no idea

4015.14 --> 4022.7
all I know is there's no proof of any

4018.559 --> 4026.059
physical position or source for all that

4022.7 --> 4029.3799999999997
light it's a hologram it just manifests

4026.059 --> 4032.8390000000004
the light arrives it's absorbed even

4029.38 --> 4037.599
translated into heat it's not coming

4032.839 --> 4037.599
from anywhere it's just arriving

4040.22 --> 4042.64
hmm

4045.02 --> 4049.099
what caused the eclipse well certainly

4047.42 --> 4051.38
not the Moon the Moon is not even there

4049.099 --> 4054.079
for three days Bad Karma

4051.38 --> 4056.839
or did you conveniently forget that that

4054.079 --> 4058.7000000000003
you don't even see the moon

4056.839 --> 4061.4
during those three days it's not the

4058.7 --> 4063.859
moon moving in front of the sun whatever

4061.4 --> 4067.0
they are it's all a holographic

4063.859 --> 4067.0
spectacle all of it

4068.96 --> 4073.16
the sun has a lot of sun but long

4071.299 --> 4076.339
distance ham radio communication

4073.16 --> 4079.52
improves what okay that's weird

4076.339 --> 4083.02
that's definitely weird steamy Trevor I

4079.52 --> 4083.02
have no idea how that's possible

4083.48 --> 4086.38
maybe it's

4086.9 --> 4092.539
that's no that's beyond me I've I've

4089.42 --> 4094.7000000000003
heard that before by the way

4092.539 --> 4096.92
thanks for reminding me yeah I knew

4094.7 --> 4100.04
there it had some influences

4096.92 --> 4103.1
on radio I don't understand why though I

4100.04 --> 4105.199
really really don't all I know is

4103.1 --> 4107.96
it's not

4105.199 --> 4110.98
a thing happening in any euclidean

4107.96 --> 4110.9800000000005
position in space

4111.92 --> 4115.659
it's just a light operation

4120.799 --> 4125.659
Sunspot moves so it does turn or you can

4123.98 --> 4127.8189999999995
think of it as turning even though it's

4125.659 --> 4132.0199999999995
not a physical object in any position

4127.819 --> 4133.819
yeah so you imagine how the Hologram is

4132.02 --> 4136.52
turning yes

4133.819 --> 4139.299
you go imagine that

4136.52 --> 4139.299000000001
it's very nice

4151.4 --> 4158.0
yes it is okay because it's my [ __ ]

4153.98 --> 4160.5199999999995
show troll scum yeah I can do that yeah

4158.0 --> 4163.46
and these crazy claims

4160.52 --> 4166.580000000001
are kind of desperate attempts to just

4163.46 --> 4169.279
try to convey what I understand about it

4166.58 --> 4171.699
and I've been trying for six years

4169.279 --> 4171.6990000000005
straight

4172.279 --> 4181.1
on a weekly basis for six years [ __ ]

4178.159 --> 4183.62
so yeah crazy yeah crazy consistent

4181.1 --> 4186.02
though I'm very freaking consistent

4183.62 --> 4188.54
why'd you go look back at an episode of

4186.02 --> 4191.6
flatter talks where I talk about guess

4188.54 --> 4195.26
what you're gonna hear almost the exact

4191.6 --> 4197.42
same vernacular explanation except I was

4195.26 --> 4200.179
probably a little less eloquent with my

4197.42 --> 4200.84
words back then but it's effectively the

4200.179 --> 4203.78
same

4200.84 --> 4207.5
yeah because I'm consistent oh it seems

4203.78 --> 4209.78
so crazy yeah but it's consistent though

4207.5 --> 4213.08
it's I'm it's not something I'm just

4209.78 --> 4216.099999999999
making up I'm trying to explain what I'm

4213.08 --> 4216.1
understanding about it

4219.34 --> 4225.8
Holograms gets us hit yet yes it does

4222.38 --> 4230.32
yes it does I'm so sick of people saying

4225.8 --> 4235.46
that stupid ass from work yes they do

4230.32 --> 4237.04
even Holograms we can make with physical

4235.46 --> 4239.179
technology

4237.04 --> 4243.38
radiate heat

4239.179 --> 4246.38
you can get a tan from a hologram that's

4243.38 --> 4249.38
right you can get a 10 from a hologram

4246.38 --> 4252.9400000000005
that's right you can get a 10 from a

4249.38 --> 4252.9400000000005
hologram that's right

4264.83 --> 4267.93
[Music]

4270.92 --> 4274.0
don't want to hear it

4275.78 --> 4281.239
same stupid thing hearing it over and

4278.78 --> 4283.94
over and over again from all these

4281.239 --> 4287.0599999999995
people over the years saying the same

4283.94 --> 4289.58
damn responses every single [ __ ] time

4287.06 --> 4292.6990000000005
and every time I try to explain it

4289.58 --> 4297.5199999999995
consistently and everybody just [ __ ]

4292.699 --> 4297.5199999999995
forgets it again I'm so sick of it

4304.699 --> 4310.0599999999995
yes I know Matthew Hall you can make a

4306.739 --> 4310.0599999999995
rap song out of that if you want

4311.179 --> 4315.58
perfectly okay from with that and so

4329.3 --> 4333.860000000001
every time I click here the first thing

4331.46 --> 4336.82
you're pouring coffee no I'm not

4333.86 --> 4336.82
drinking coffee anymore

4339.5 --> 4347.199
this is all green tea

4342.92 --> 4347.1990000000005
oh wait no this is minty actually yeah

4368.739 --> 4372.919999999999
unsubbed against your shifter hello by

4371.0 --> 4375.679
the way good to see you

4372.92 --> 4377.12
yeah YouTube and Subs a whole bunch of

4375.679 --> 4379.58
people

4377.12 --> 4381.62
like especially from channels that you

4379.58 --> 4383.6
don't really follow on a daily basis and

4381.62 --> 4385.58
then it's like oh how is he doing and

4383.6 --> 4388.88
you're going there like what why I'm not

4385.58 --> 4391.42
soft I'm supposed to be subbed so sneak

4388.88 --> 4394.1
you like sneak attack and subbing

4391.42 --> 4396.1990000000005
YouTube likes to do that

4394.1 --> 4400.42
it's very annoying

4396.199 --> 4400.419999999999
they just want to make you forget

4400.64 --> 4405.4400000000005
you're gonna forget about it just don't

4402.98 --> 4408.44
remember them right because there will

4405.44 --> 4410.299999999999
be new YouTubers that will insert a new

4408.44 --> 4412.699
[ __ ] story

4410.3 --> 4415.52
to make you forget and then think all

4412.699 --> 4418.4
their dumbass models that they have

4415.52 --> 4421.159000000001
under their control that they find much

4418.4 --> 4423.259999999999
more predictable and usable for their

4421.159 --> 4426.44
schemes and mind control manipulations

4423.26 --> 4427.4800000000005
on the long run so just forget about all

4426.44 --> 4430.339999999999
those

4427.48 --> 4433.099999999999
older YouTubers and

4430.34 --> 4434.78
you know you'll just be unsubbed so you

4433.1 --> 4437.360000000001
can't forget about him and just don't

4434.78 --> 4438.8
remember them and just look out for new

4437.36 --> 4442.159
YouTubers

4438.8 --> 4445.58
that just blabber more standardized

4442.159 --> 4447.32
rhetoric nonsense just going sub to them

4445.58 --> 4449.48
right you're not gonna get UPS up

4447.32 --> 4451.28
unsubbed for them no once you sub to

4449.48 --> 4454.4
them all the recommendations gonna be

4451.28 --> 4457.82
full of that oh look so special this is

4454.4 --> 4460.46
a good YouTuber oh we want you to look

4457.82 --> 4464.239
that what's that

4460.46 --> 4468.26
trust us we're here to make you smarter

4464.239 --> 4470.419999999999
not to send you into shitholes

4468.26 --> 4472.76
right just forget about those older

4470.42 --> 4474.679
YouTubers we're just gonna secretly

4472.76 --> 4477.62
unsub you because we kind of want you to

4474.679 --> 4479.92
forget about them huh yeah we know

4477.62 --> 4479.92
YouTube

4502.94 --> 4505.12
foreign

4509.48 --> 4512.139999999999
okay

4514.46 --> 4521.6
YouTube here to make money nothing more

4517.52 --> 4524.320000000001
yeah yeah oh well I'm sure that you

4521.6 --> 4524.320000000001
appreciate

4524.719 --> 4533.0
your corporation to tell you what to

4529.46 --> 4535.4
follow and not right it's like oh oh

4533.0 --> 4537.08
they don't even say like hey maybe you

4535.4 --> 4538.839999999999
don't want to sub to them right which

4537.08 --> 4542.179
would be very invasive now they just

4538.84 --> 4544.04
secretly unsub you oh that's so

4542.179 --> 4546.4400000000005
reasonable they just want to make money

4544.04 --> 4548.48
so they're just gonna [ __ ] with you

4546.44 --> 4550.28
without even telling you it's all they

4548.48 --> 4552.32
just want to make money that's okay

4550.28 --> 4553.88
right where they want to make money they

4552.32 --> 4556.46
can do whatever the [ __ ] you want they

4553.88 --> 4558.08
can just kidnap you put you into a

4556.46 --> 4560.4800000000005
dungeon I mean they only want to make

4558.08 --> 4563.239
money right so okay

4560.48 --> 4566.12
right rocket man it's all okay

4563.239 --> 4568.099999999999
because they just want to make money so

4566.12 --> 4570.5
they can do whatever the [ __ ] they want

4568.1 --> 4573.34
then I guess

4570.5 --> 4573.34
Rocket Man

4580.22 --> 4583.259
[Music]

4583.4 --> 4587.48
holographic nature when talking about

4585.26 --> 4589.159000000001
eclipses does make sense yeah it's the

4587.48 --> 4591.08
only thing that makes sense in my

4589.159 --> 4594.28
opinion dub Mondo

4591.08 --> 4594.28
just the only thing

4598.64 --> 4603.58
like like have you even noticed that

4601.28 --> 4607.82
like during an eclipse

4603.58 --> 4610.54
that all Shadows suddenly become Eclipse

4607.82 --> 4610.54
shaped

4610.94 --> 4616.699
I'll try to explain that to me without

4614.179 --> 4620.92
it being a hologram like because that's

4616.699 --> 4620.919999999999
just the craziest thing I've ever seen

4621.8 --> 4627.08
but yeah it happens when their eclipse

4624.26 --> 4629.360000000001
is going and the move the disc whatever

4627.08 --> 4632.659
it is the darkness goes in front of the

4629.36 --> 4636.139999999999
sun then suddenly all the Shadows like

4632.659 --> 4641.0199999999995
you have that's light on a tree all the

4636.14 --> 4641.02
Shadows become micro eclipses it's crazy

4641.42 --> 4646.3
crazy never seen anything else like that

4650.6 --> 4655.0
have you ever seen that I have

4665.06 --> 4670.04
who this is real good yeah that's called

4667.46 --> 4673.64
stats Rocket Man

4670.04 --> 4676.28
I have to present something

4673.64 --> 4678.64
I have to show that I'm actually doing

4676.28 --> 4678.639999999999
this

4679.46 --> 4683.9
besides I literally don't even know how

4681.8 --> 4685.9400000000005
to turn off the super chat anymore I

4683.9 --> 4687.98
don't know how to do it I if it tried to

4685.94 --> 4691.099999999999
work through it

4687.98 --> 4694.759999999999
just don't know how to turn it off

4691.1 --> 4697.04
can't really stop it and the ads

4694.76 --> 4702.14
well

4697.04 --> 4704.659
I always make sure that my ads are never

4702.14 --> 4707.179
gonna force you to watch through some

4704.659 --> 4710.48
long thing ever right if you paid

4707.179 --> 4713.06
attention guys the ads will always be

4710.48 --> 4715.04
clickable click away you can always

4713.06 --> 4716.4800000000005
click away after like five six seconds

4715.04 --> 4719.36
always

4716.48 --> 4721.58
because I specifically turn off the edge

4719.36 --> 4723.139999999999
you can't click away right

4721.58 --> 4724.94
you're welcome

4723.14 --> 4726.92
because those are the most [ __ ]

4724.94 --> 4729.799999999999
annoying ads there are and they're

4726.92 --> 4733.34
usually like alcohol and garbage right

4729.8 --> 4735.56
so yeah I make sure that you can always

4733.34 --> 4737.78
click it away you don't need ad blocker

4735.56 --> 4739.820000000001
you can always click it away after like

4737.78 --> 4742.099999999999
five or six seconds every single time

4739.82 --> 4745.04
because I I

4742.1 --> 4747.679
Tinker it like that specifically for you

4745.04 --> 4751.34
guys you're welcome

4747.679 --> 4754.659
right and the ads do actually help me

4751.34 --> 4754.659000000001
they do actually

4754.76 --> 4762.02
like because they stay and over time

4758.0 --> 4766.0
they actually compound so

4762.02 --> 4766.0
yeah should be worth it

4767.12 --> 4772.699
and it's only a minor nuisance

4770.96 --> 4774.9800000000005
because you can always click it away

4772.699 --> 4777.159
after five or six seconds every single

4774.98 --> 4777.159
ad

4808.58 --> 4816.08
ever show a product like so what

4812.96 --> 4819.199
uh well that would depend on the product

4816.08 --> 4822.62
but I see that as very unlike like who

4819.199 --> 4825.82
would even do that like who would come

4822.62 --> 4825.82
with their product to me

4826.82 --> 4830.08
I don't think that will work

4835.94 --> 4844.638999999999
right I'm not properly media trained

4841.28 --> 4848.0199999999995
I'm not very convenient

4844.639 --> 4848.02
for ads like that

4869.42 --> 4874.159
I'm not gonna sell my apps no no there

4872.239 --> 4876.879999999999
is no more absent

4874.159 --> 4876.879999999999
God

4879.08 --> 4883.12
so glad I'm done with that crap

4885.5 --> 4894.699
what is gravity nothing is concept

4889.88 --> 4894.6990000000005
it's a mathematical excuse

4895.52 --> 4899.96
to justify a model

4898.639 --> 4902.92
right

4899.96 --> 4902.92
that's what it is

4909.679 --> 4914.659
gravity in the global no no it's not

4912.26 --> 4917.860000000001
magnetism

4914.659 --> 4917.86
that's ridiculous

4919.219 --> 4924.02
now it's the Banning of a conceptual

4921.56 --> 4926.3
medium but you can think of it as a

4924.02 --> 4928.76
force like Newtonian but it isn't though

4926.3 --> 4931.76
it's not even like that officiency I

4928.76 --> 4933.9800000000005
mean it's still popular to approach it

4931.76 --> 4936.1990000000005
like that and they leave people doing

4933.98 --> 4938.599999999999
that like oh yeah you could use

4936.199 --> 4941.54
Newtonian gravity if you really want to

4938.6 --> 4943.46
you can play around with that it just

4941.54 --> 4945.86
isn't relevant to anything that's

4943.46 --> 4948.7390000000005
claimed to be real

4945.86 --> 4950.0
right so you can think of it as a force

4948.739 --> 4953.0599999999995
but it isn't

4950.0 --> 4956.5
it's the bending of a conceptual medium

4953.06 --> 4960.5
and it doesn't do anything it literally

4956.5 --> 4963.86
doesn't do anything

4960.5 --> 4966.8
I mean there's just vague associations

4963.86 --> 4970.759999999999
literally it's vague associations now

4966.8 --> 4972.02
right the accelerating part which isn't

4970.76 --> 4974.96
even a thing

4972.02 --> 4977.6
things as they displace they accelerate

4974.96 --> 4978.44
it that's supposed to be some kind of a

4977.6 --> 4980.6
hint

4978.44 --> 4983.0599999999995
depending of space-time well none of it

4980.6 --> 4988.179
makes any damn sense

4983.06 --> 4988.179
and there is no provable effect

4988.639 --> 4993.26
it's just associations that are very

4991.219 --> 4996.62
easily explainable

4993.26 --> 4998.0
through other more scientifically based

4996.62 --> 5000.639
Concepts

4998.0 --> 5002.739
like relative density which explains

5000.639 --> 5004.92
everything that is associated with

5002.739 --> 5008.199
gravity everything

5004.92 --> 5011.26
that gravity claims to have some kind of

5008.199 --> 5015.46
a grip on or association with relative

5011.26 --> 5018.219
density explains it perfectly flawlessly

5015.46 --> 5020.7390000000005
even in complex setups no problem

5018.219 --> 5023.08
whatsoever to explain every aspect

5020.739 --> 5024.459999999999
that's associated with gravity in

5023.08 --> 5026.25
relative density

5024.46 --> 5029.75
to a scientific degree

5026.25 --> 5029.75
[Music]

5045.28 --> 5050.08
and describe it as before dude you could

5047.86 --> 5053.5
think of it and describe it however you

5050.08 --> 5058.12
like it's not a force though

5053.5 --> 5060.219
so that's all very nice you want to go

5058.12 --> 5062.44
try it out on the Flat Earth debates hey

5060.219 --> 5064.659
Rocket Man why don't you go to the Flat

5062.44 --> 5066.04
Earth debates then why'd you try your

5064.659 --> 5069.179
luck over there

5066.04 --> 5069.179
see how that goes

5070.42 --> 5075.6
that was a relative density of

5071.679 --> 5080.62
predictive capabilities absolutely

5075.6 --> 5080.620000000001
complete hundred percent predictability

5080.98 --> 5086.739
every every component is 100 predictable

5101.56 --> 5107.1
yeah yeah but rocket man yeah hey hey

5104.46 --> 5110.62
you can treat

5107.1 --> 5112.659000000001
treatment yeah you can treat poor old

5110.62 --> 5114.699
gravity as if it is a force right you

5112.659 --> 5117.638999999999
like to think he is a force

5114.699 --> 5121.36
it's very popular he was he was all the

5117.639 --> 5123.58
popular man gravity you know back in the

5121.36 --> 5126.58
days when people just thought of him as

5123.58 --> 5128.679
a force he was all popular so yeah

5126.58 --> 5131.0199999999995
it's like the people that are

5128.679 --> 5133.96
maintaining right they elect to treat it

5131.02 --> 5136.42
better like like it was the old days you

5133.96 --> 5139.36
know when he was still a force he isn't

5136.42 --> 5141.04
though it's not a force you could treat

5139.36 --> 5145.36
it as a force

5141.04 --> 5145.36
it's not a force though yeah

5157.42 --> 5162.159
has rdd been expressed mathematically

5160.06 --> 5164.679
well that's not relevant to anything Bob

5162.159 --> 5168.46
Wilson but yes

5164.679 --> 5171.4800000000005
go to Tony sleeping Warrior is done it

5168.46 --> 5171.4800000000005
all he's like

5172.179 --> 5177.52
way back

5174.04 --> 5179.08
me Adam Meek and Tony like even did the

5177.52 --> 5181.84
whole math thing

5179.08 --> 5184.42
it's just not really noteworthy because

5181.84 --> 5186.58
you can describe it you know I don't

5184.42 --> 5190.6
like math I think it's kind of a waste

5186.58 --> 5193.12
of time as in it is a waste of time you

5190.6 --> 5195.76
can describe it you can describe every

5193.12 --> 5198.94
aspect of relative density how it

5195.76 --> 5201.280000000001
happens what happens why it happens all

5198.94 --> 5204.239
verbally all descriptively you don't

5201.28 --> 5204.239
need math

5204.94 --> 5209.98
math kind of makes things more vague

5208.36 --> 5212.679
even

5209.98 --> 5215.58
to me

5212.679 --> 5215.58
get out of here

5226.48 --> 5232.379999999999
this acceleration oh God we got a funny

5229.54 --> 5232.38
in our midst

5235.8 --> 5241.6
very very gay icon

5239.679 --> 5244.32
terrible

5241.6 --> 5244.320000000001
it's like

5244.42 --> 5248.7390000000005
throw just for that I can alone I should

5246.94 --> 5253.0
ban you

5248.739 --> 5256.599999999999
because that [ __ ] is not welcome here

5253.0 --> 5259.08
there will be no rainbow Flags here

5256.6 --> 5259.08
none

5262.719 --> 5267.58
math is a universal language yeah and it

5265.06 --> 5270.280000000001
doesn't prove anything Bob Wilson huh

5267.58 --> 5273.1
it's a universal language that doesn't

5270.28 --> 5276.099999999999
prove anything yeah and I'd like to just

5273.1 --> 5278.620000000001
use regular language

5276.1 --> 5280.659000000001
he had to describe

5278.62 --> 5284.92
the effects

5280.659 --> 5290.219
how it works yeah because English is

5284.92 --> 5290.219
also a language I prefer it over math

5304.679 --> 5309.159
oh my God look at the baller squirting

5307.36 --> 5312.36
I'll be right back in two minutes don't

5309.159 --> 5312.36
let him squirt too hard

5313.199 --> 5316.32
thank you

5371.32 --> 5373.5
foreign

5383.56 --> 5385.679
thank you

5426.719 --> 5429.719
thank you

5455.5 --> 5460.78
ah thank you Rocket Man for changing

5458.92 --> 5463.92
that

5460.78 --> 5463.92
is much better

5464.02 --> 5470.1
though pink is not exactly my favorite

5466.3 --> 5470.1
still gay but whatever man

5506.38 --> 5513.42
hello SKS

5509.32 --> 5513.42
I'm not talking about that right now

5525.58 --> 5528.719
hey Kevlar

5531.34 --> 5535.38
yeah you missed quite another show again

5535.659 --> 5540.94
although I'm gonna rename it because

5537.46 --> 5544.7390000000005
this is nothing to do with the title

5540.94 --> 5544.739
although I really like the title

5545.32 --> 5550.5
probably displace it to another show

5562.54 --> 5569.04
pink used to be men's what the hell are

5566.38 --> 5569.04
you talking about

5573.639 --> 5577.02
I'm pretty sure it wasn't

5593.5 --> 5598.139
oh man I'm really hungry

5601.6 --> 5606.659000000001
getting all shouty does really make me

5604.239 --> 5606.659
hungry

5609.4 --> 5611.58
foreign

5619.9 --> 5625.46
what was up with yesterday what do you

5622.54 --> 5628.63
mean what was up with yesterday

5625.46 --> 5628.63
[Music]

5641.26 --> 5646.900000000001
I Lydia looks I don't know many how many

5643.96 --> 5649.54
years ago that was

5646.9 --> 5652.9
right but that must have been like a

5649.54 --> 5655.48
whole long time ago then

5652.9 --> 5657.638999999999
I mean maybe like in the 20s or

5655.48 --> 5660.839999999999
something

5657.639 --> 5660.84
I don't know

5667.719 --> 5671.9800000000005
I never liked the pink color I just

5669.94 --> 5675.0599999999995
don't like it don't like it the color

5671.98 --> 5675.0599999999995
just don't

5683.92 --> 5690.46
unless Perhaps it is mixed in with some

5688.0 --> 5694.0
good purple

5690.46 --> 5695.56
and maybe like dark blue right if it's

5694.0 --> 5697.9
combined

5695.56 --> 5701.1990000000005
with other colors then I'm like yeah

5697.9 --> 5703.119
yeah it could work but just pink ugh no

5701.199 --> 5705.4
thanks yuck

5703.119 --> 5708.54
I really don't like it especially if

5705.4 --> 5708.54
it's like neon pink

5711.62 --> 5714.8
[Music]

5722.38 --> 5728.56
wasn't well yesterday oh yeah Jeff gas

5725.38 --> 5732.659000000001
you weren't all that well

5728.56 --> 5732.659000000001
I think I remember how are you doing

5733.3 --> 5740.679
right purple red and blue

5736.42 --> 5743.619
and then pink can be among it as long as

5740.679 --> 5746.5
it's not dominant right

5743.619 --> 5748.0599999999995
but a bit of pink yeah why not like I

5746.5 --> 5751.119
used to have like this what is it

5748.06 --> 5755.02
tie-dye type of shirt

5751.119 --> 5756.94
with basically Pink Elephants or a pink

5755.02 --> 5760.2390000000005
it was

5756.94 --> 5761.5
purple and pink and blue and a bit of

5760.239 --> 5763.659
red

5761.5 --> 5765.58
and it had an elephant on it I thought

5763.659 --> 5767.739
it was cool

5765.58 --> 5770.94
it's my favorite hippie shirt I still

5767.739 --> 5770.94
have it somewhere by the way

5771.04 --> 5774.88
it's in a box somewhere

5778.96 --> 5784.86
but just like the pink thing no thanks

5789.159 --> 5793.599999999999
some really

5791.04 --> 5797.28
creepy ass bastards out there I don't

5793.6 --> 5797.280000000001
like to wear it I really don't

5804.82 --> 5810.94
yeah do you have gas like

5808.06 --> 5814.26
what's going on I hope this is not like

5810.94 --> 5814.259999999999
a big issue

5839.38 --> 5842.499
[Music]

5844.78 --> 5847.78
foreign

5861.08 --> 5869.47
[Applause]

5874.239 --> 5879.959999999999
I'm gonna call this show you can get a

5876.88 --> 5879.96
tan from a hologram

5881.26 --> 5886.92
I think that's probably a more suited

5883.78 --> 5886.92
name for Today Show

5890.8 --> 5895.84
but I'm definitely going to remember the

5892.78 --> 5897.58
great table top row table toppling role

5895.84 --> 5900.639
playing in

5897.58 --> 5903.719
because that is a really awesome title

5900.639 --> 5903.719
for a show

5919.48 --> 5925.0
lots of issues oh

5922.239 --> 5927.218999999999
health issues you mean but you don't

5925.0 --> 5929.38
want to go into it that's fine but I

5927.219 --> 5932.08
would like to be informed though

5929.38 --> 5935.58
maybe I could give you a tip or

5932.08 --> 5935.58
something help out

5936.1 --> 5940.38
but if you don't want to talk about it

5937.54 --> 5940.38
right now that's fine

5982.659 --> 5986.138999999999
kind of funny how globers want to use

5984.76 --> 5988.360000000001
Newtonian Einstein gravity

5986.139 --> 5991.84
interchangeable yes well they think it's

5988.36 --> 5994.42
all the same right because they were

5991.84 --> 5997.179
allowed to think of gravity whatever the

5994.42 --> 5998.7390000000005
[ __ ] they wanted right they can think of

5997.179 --> 6001.32
it whatever they want so they can take

5998.739 --> 6004.199
us interchangeable no I didn't replace

6001.32 --> 6007.32
it it's just it's the same it's the same

6004.199 --> 6009.239
it's just another way of explaining the

6007.32 --> 6011.099999999999
old [ __ ] except that's officially

6009.239 --> 6012.659
just not true

6011.1 --> 6015.900000000001
it is

6012.659 --> 6018.119
but they're just allowed to free roam

6015.9 --> 6020.638999999999
and think whatever the [ __ ] they want

6018.119 --> 6023.46
about gravity and nobody's gonna stop

6020.639 --> 6026.9400000000005
them right so that's really the issue

6023.46 --> 6030.619
it's like yeah chaos and they're just

6026.94 --> 6030.619
letting people do whatever they like

6031.619 --> 6037.0199999999995
but yeah people at universities and all

6034.5 --> 6040.159
that they're not gonna get caught saying

6037.02 --> 6040.159000000001
that something that's stupid

6040.619 --> 6045.78
right

6042.719 --> 6047.76
like at best they'll tell the world like

6045.78 --> 6050.639
yeah you could think of it as a force

6047.76 --> 6052.860000000001
you know it isn't but yeah you don't

6050.639 --> 6055.38
really have to work at a really is level

6052.86 --> 6057.599999999999
something like that they're not actually

6055.38 --> 6059.159000000001
gonna be caught like no it's the same

6057.6 --> 6062.04
it's the same because then when they

6059.159 --> 6064.259999999999
immediately discredit themselves

6062.04 --> 6066.36
right they immediately prove they're

6064.26 --> 6069.3
just dwelling and they don't get

6066.36 --> 6070.86
the actual mechanics they don't get the

6069.3 --> 6073.02
history they don't they don't understand

6070.86 --> 6074.28
what they're talking about if they say

6073.02 --> 6076.02
that so they're not gonna do that

6074.28 --> 6078.36
they're just gonna leave that to the

6076.02 --> 6080.46
idiots out there in the field in the

6078.36 --> 6082.92
anti-flat earth there's that

6080.46 --> 6085.26
go everywhere

6082.92 --> 6089.84
because they have no credibility they

6085.26 --> 6089.84
have no dignity left to stop them

6090.119 --> 6093.719
right

6091.44 --> 6095.759999999999
so yeah you can think of gravity

6093.719 --> 6097.8
whatever the [ __ ] you want

6095.76 --> 6099.900000000001
it isn't though

6097.8 --> 6102.78
doesn't really matter what you're gonna

6099.9 --> 6106.28
say it isn't because gravity is a

6102.78 --> 6106.28
concept that has no proof

6106.5 --> 6114.26
at all like any proof nothing absolutely

6110.639 --> 6116.52
nothing only vague correlations and

6114.26 --> 6119.280000000001
presuppositional assumptions that's it

6116.52 --> 6121.639
that's the only thing it has nothing

6119.28 --> 6121.639
else

6128.88 --> 6131.659000000001
uh

6137.159 --> 6144.86
hey by the way hello blue

6139.699 --> 6144.86
y4j been listening for real sad thanks

6166.139 --> 6170.400000000001
oh oh wow weather turned around now it's

6169.44 --> 6173.299999999999
raining

6170.4 --> 6173.299999999999
boo

6174.179 --> 6178.679
I guess one of the bigger clouds is now

6176.28 --> 6180.42
coming over

6178.679 --> 6185.06
it's a good thing that I already went

6180.42 --> 6185.06
out for groceries so I could stay inside

6186.6 --> 6190.08
right but I think I'm gonna round out

6188.34 --> 6193.58
the show maybe a little early but I'm

6190.08 --> 6193.58
just really hungry right now

6194.76 --> 6200.219
and yeah so the trolls in chat it's

6197.699 --> 6203.759999999999
getting a bit of a nuisance it's much

6200.219 --> 6207.139
harder to focus on anything in like this

6203.76 --> 6207.139
just blabbering away

6222.179 --> 6229.08
they are equivalent in a non-relevant

6225.96 --> 6231.54
what the [ __ ] are you just look at that

6229.08 --> 6233.28
look at Rocket Man I'm just blabbering

6231.54 --> 6236.659
like he's some kind of a philosopher

6233.28 --> 6236.659
it's hilarious

6237.119 --> 6244.159
why are you separating the two they are

6240.36 --> 6247.82
equivalent in non-relativistic contacts

6244.159 --> 6247.82
so sure

6248.52 --> 6253.159000000001
that's really freaking funny

6255.0 --> 6259.04
like that actually means anything

6259.38 --> 6264.78
that's like that's yeah that is kind of

6262.56 --> 6268.1
technobabble isn't it when rocket man

6264.78 --> 6268.099999999999
just said that is techno level

6271.82 --> 6278.0
referencing Einstein's equivalence

6274.02 --> 6278.0
principle oh yeah sure

6278.46 --> 6283.86
well you know that Einstein has not

6281.28 --> 6285.659
actually proven anything or barely

6283.86 --> 6288.36
anything I think he may have proven

6285.659 --> 6289.739
something about a photo sensitive plate

6288.36 --> 6292.619
or something

6289.739 --> 6295.799999999999
other than that Einstein did never ever

6292.619 --> 6298.619
prove anything beyond math

6295.8 --> 6303.84
you do realize that right Rocket Man

6298.619 --> 6303.839999999999
that Einstein was a mathematician

6304.1 --> 6311.42
not a physicist

6307.619 --> 6311.42
you do realize that right

6313.1 --> 6317.88
experimental yeah that's right

6315.139 --> 6320.52
experiment yeah you need experiment to

6317.88 --> 6322.38
actually be considered a physicist so he

6320.52 --> 6324.719
wasn't a physicist

6322.38 --> 6327.619
it wasn't a theoretical physicist he

6324.719 --> 6327.619
wasn't a physicist

6327.84 --> 6334.38
he was a mathematician

6330.719 --> 6336.42
he didn't actually prove any science he

6334.38 --> 6338.6990000000005
didn't prove anything about physics he

6336.42 --> 6341.88
just made a bunch of mathematical based

6338.699 --> 6345.0599999999995
models that didn't prove anything

6341.88 --> 6347.639
but it provided a framework for you to

6345.06 --> 6350.1
squirt about and see more smart and

6347.639 --> 6352.5
philosophical not actually proving

6350.1 --> 6355.56
anything just like him it's not just

6352.5 --> 6357.96
great thanks Einstein thanks for giving

6355.56 --> 6360.0
us all this mathematical [ __ ] so

6357.96 --> 6362.84
people can delude themselves into

6360.0 --> 6365.34
thinking they're smart by talking

6362.84 --> 6369.8
technobabble in your shadow

6365.34 --> 6369.8
thanks Einstein that's great

6372.0 --> 6376.76
right so thanks everyone for coming

6376.86 --> 6383.159
[ __ ] Universal speed limit is [ __ ]

6379.86 --> 6385.339999999999
strong lensing we can what the [ __ ] are

6383.159 --> 6385.339999999999
you

6388.98 --> 6393.718999999999
yeah stop spamming

6391.739 --> 6397.08
this is all crap

6393.719 --> 6400.02
gravitational Vortex get the [ __ ] out of

6397.08 --> 6403.5199999999995
here I should ban you for that

6400.02 --> 6403.52
what a [ __ ]

6403.679 --> 6408.54
you're gonna say proving a gravitational

6406.5 --> 6410.88
forward are you [ __ ] out of your mind

6408.54 --> 6412.679
you were [ __ ] after everything we

6410.88 --> 6414.900000000001
talked about in the last 15 minutes

6412.679 --> 6417.119
you're gonna say he proved a

6414.9 --> 6419.839999999999
gravitational vortex

6417.119 --> 6419.839999999999
that's

6420.239 --> 6423.959999999999
that's just embarrassing it's not even

6422.94 --> 6426.36
funny

6423.96 --> 6429.06
right anyway

6426.36 --> 6431.339999999999
thanks everyone for coming if you like

6429.06 --> 6433.4400000000005

great

6457.619 --> 6461.28
right

6459.3 --> 6465.119000000001
I will be back tomorrow with flat Earth

6461.28 --> 6465.119
early bird number 1132

6465.239 --> 6468.36
that would be

6466.619 --> 6470.4
on the third no that would be on the

6468.36 --> 6471.96
Friday already wow this week has flown

by

6471.96 --> 6475.38
right and I'm gonna of course join the

6473.58 --> 6477.54
flatters debates which would start up

6475.38 --> 6478.9800000000005
any minute now hope to see you there in

6477.54 --> 6485.04
chat
