risk see you again Voynich michael roark

179.24 --> 187.20000000000002
drew drew Miaka i stopped in traffic at

184.98 --> 200.91
my rest had you're up early

187.2 --> 203.54999999999998
or really late clean clean yeah it was

200.91 --> 205.41
kind of weird yeah as I said like I was

203.55 --> 209.34
kind of waiting like oh [ __ ] where do I

205.41 --> 212.16
get this money and so expensive and then

209.34 --> 218.91
I yeah my dad called after Rhys called

212.16 --> 222.78
me over Skype and awesome

218.91 --> 226.25
he really knows how to shine in the

222.78 --> 231.27
light when I feel like really shitty

226.25 --> 235.98
it's just amazing that guy you know true

231.27 --> 238.92000000000002
friend but yeah my dad called and he

235.98 --> 240.17
told me something that I totally didn't

238.92 --> 242.64
see coming

240.17 --> 247.38
like totally because I thought like oh

242.64 --> 250.64999999999998
[ __ ] like money but he actually told me

247.38 --> 256.98
like yeah why don't you just do it

250.65 --> 262.2
yourself I was like

256.98 --> 265.17
wait hmm yeah I might actually be able

262.2 --> 268.56
to do that never even occurred to me

265.17 --> 272.88
like maybe I could do it myself I've

268.56 --> 275.48
seen it being done before like it's a

272.88 --> 278.04
funny thing about me like earlier

275.48 --> 281.37
I'm always typically a guy when some

278.04 --> 284.64000000000004
handyman is doing something I want to be

281.37 --> 287.13
there and yet not try to get in his face

284.64 --> 288.96
but assist like handing tools are

287.13 --> 291.45
bringing cup of tea I'm really that kind

288.96 --> 294.53999999999996
of guy but I also pay a lot attention to

291.45 --> 297.12
what they do and yeah then I remember

294.54 --> 297.84000000000003
like oh wait yeah wait yeah I think I

297.12 --> 302.39
can do that

297.84 --> 306.35999999999996
so yeah I'm I'm gonna do that and I am

302.39 --> 308.96999999999997
already and did have to buy a couple of

306.36 --> 314.07
tools but the price really wasn't that

308.97 --> 320.04
bad and after everything's finished it's

314.07 --> 322.77
not yeah it's gonna cost less like less

320.04 --> 326.84000000000003
than one-third what I thought it was

322.77 --> 330.53999999999996
gonna cost and yeah I got some PayPal

326.84 --> 333.29999999999995
help from both Riza and Randy like

330.54 --> 335.25
substantial and it's basically gonna

333.3 --> 338.85
cover it it's incredible

335.25 --> 340.56
now all I have to do is not screw up and

338.85 --> 343.35
I'm probably won because I'm gonna

340.56 --> 346.2
approach it very carefully and getting

343.35 --> 351.42
the glass is also quite easy didn't

346.2 --> 352.8
expect that like you can go there you

351.42 --> 355.74
have to have the right size so I have to

352.8 --> 358.61
like yeah get these splints off of there

355.74 --> 361.43
first carefully not break them otherwise

358.61 --> 363.77000000000004
after we invited those as well it might

361.43 --> 367.159
be a little bit more caustic anymore

363.77 --> 369.04999999999995
work but yeah they can like do it in

367.159 --> 375.009
five minutes is pretty incredible it's a

369.05 --> 379.34000000000003
really good wide option custom glass

375.009 --> 382.25
company pretty much very close by isn't

379.34 --> 385.28
yet not even not even a half a kilometer

382.25 --> 388.55
away so yeah it's like okay this is

385.28 --> 390.43899999999996
doable I can do this that divide a

388.55 --> 392.24
couple of tools but it's not that bad

390.439 --> 396.34900000000005
and yeah I could always use them later

392.24 --> 398.419
again probably still have those things

396.349 --> 401.62899999999996
but they're in my storage in another

398.419 --> 404.29999999999995
city so it's gonna be more complicated

401.629 --> 408.069
to get that and a lot more time I just

404.3 --> 411.969
bought it and it's not that expensive so

408.069 --> 411.969
yeah it's gonna work out

414.27 --> 422.74
yeah had a bit of feedback with ranty

419.38 --> 424.569
about the whole the whole wizard thing

422.74 --> 429.93
that's just called like that and it was

424.569 --> 433.41900000000004
also kind of good you did hear me and

429.93 --> 441.509
yeah I will see where that goes not

433.419 --> 441.50899999999996
ready to deal with that yet and see

442.15 --> 453.84999999999997
oh yeah yeah they and he's been like

447.04 --> 456.07
looking into these say yeah like pretty

453.85 --> 458.56
it's even a little bit older older

456.07 --> 461.5
alternative science approaches of

458.56 --> 465.639
physics approaches mainly started out

461.5 --> 468.88
with the concept a new concept of the

465.639 --> 473.669
universe by Walter Russell and it's

468.88 --> 477.33
pretty amazing because this video was

473.669 --> 483.15999999999997
it's still like this video was posted in

477.33 --> 486.01
2010 and seeing it I suddenly remembered

483.16 --> 489.58000000000004
that I actually have seen it before it

486.01 --> 490.9
that's the amazing part that happened

489.58 --> 493.21
yeah when I was still with my

490.9 --> 497.02
ex-girlfriend it fits in the timeframe

493.21 --> 498.669
of things succeeding happening a moment

497.02 --> 500.65
where I sort of woke up to Flat Earth

498.669 --> 503.65
and then you had got nipped in the bud

500.65 --> 506.229
and everything went to [ __ ]

503.65 --> 508.17999999999995
so I kind of forgot about it this as

506.229 --> 512.5
well but I've seen it before it is

508.18 --> 514.99
really amazing and yeah they and got

512.5 --> 519.339
really into it really hyped about it

514.99 --> 520.9590000000001
he's calling it like another level to

519.339 --> 523.57
Flat Earth basically and there's a good

520.959 --> 527.8499999999999
point to it because this theory explains

523.57 --> 532.32
a lot and the most amazing part of it is

527.85 --> 536.1
it describes like a pattern of creation

532.32 --> 540.9000000000001
basically through a form of duality

536.1 --> 545.38
which fits in completely with my own

540.9 --> 547.62
yeah concept of the the dual energies

545.38 --> 550.95
like darkness

547.62 --> 555.24
it's just really mind-blowing and very

550.95 --> 557.22
heavy very intellectually so yeah it

555.24 --> 561.21
requires some focus to get through it

557.22 --> 563.22
it's a pretty big video too but I've

561.21 --> 564.69
seen it before and it's really amazing

563.22 --> 569.1
looking at it again

564.69 --> 571.0200000000001
so I really appreciate day in - yeah

569.1 --> 573.8100000000001
bring that forward and show me other

571.02 --> 577.86
related videos it was very interesting

573.81 --> 582.8699999999999
and kept me up all night then Patricia

577.86 --> 585.48
had a hangout with a with a guy who had

582.87 --> 589.41
a company in CBD oils and I was also

585.48 --> 594.8100000000001
very informative but no idea that of the

589.41 --> 597.029
extensive abilities that CBD oil has so

594.81 --> 598.68
I learned more about it I knew it was

597.029 --> 601.26
great stuff but didn't know they had

598.68 --> 605.9399999999999
like all these detailed applications

601.26 --> 610.17
it's really fascinating I'm going to bed

605.94 --> 613.35
but then Riley did his video and that

610.17 --> 616.0699999999999
was just it was just too hilarious to

613.35 --> 616.07
walk away from

626.22 --> 630.02
no it's good yes

638.69 --> 649.97
well yeah thanks drill may I drill Magga

645.879 --> 653.0790000000001
yeah if you add me on skype then that

649.97 --> 653.0790000000001
definitely work out

655.5 --> 663.45
but yeah the whole thing hilarious were

659.37 --> 666.42
really did like I didn't and was video

663.45 --> 668.73
it was just weird all together because

666.42 --> 671.91
yeah apparently Dell had made a video

668.73 --> 676.94
where he was like kind of being

671.91 --> 681.4499999999999
dishonest in rearranging what was said

676.94 --> 685.1400000000001
by people like Riley and Randy and me I

681.45 --> 687.0600000000001
was like in-between there apparently he

685.14 --> 690.27
had a lot of criticism like I know what

687.06 --> 692.9699999999999
he doing his help device even Dell was

690.27 --> 698.97
he was just being a dick and Riley

692.97 --> 704.88
really showed that marvelously it was it

698.97 --> 707.46
was just hilarious in a way so yeah I

704.88 --> 713.61
said that when I went on for like two

707.46 --> 716.64
hours or more so I didn't drink any

713.61 --> 720.57
alcohol yesterday and that felt really

716.64 --> 722.49
good this morning think I'm gonna

720.57 --> 724.82
continue that

722.49 --> 728.7
it's good to have something to do

724.82 --> 730.7700000000001
because ya know it's redirecting my

728.7 --> 733.2
energies I've also been working out some

730.77 --> 736.4399999999999
I've been doing that for a while now

733.2 --> 738.75
and that also helps although yeah I got

736.44 --> 741.4200000000001
a lot now I'll get like muscle he can

738.75 --> 748.79
stuff but yeah that's supposed to happen

741.42 --> 748.79
but yeah what's quite a turnaround

750.65 --> 758.0699999999999
right so I hear saucy London 14 intro

755.64 --> 762.09
dude a drink yeah they like to brag

758.07 --> 766.47
about it apparently yeah well I do drink

762.09 --> 768.57
but I shouldn't do it like continually

766.47 --> 773.49
and I have pretty much have been doing

768.57 --> 775.47
that in the last month yeah that's it

773.49 --> 780.36
was starting to take its toll I realized

775.47 --> 782.75
it and yesterday I just just wasn't

780.36 --> 782.75
gonna do it

783.11 --> 791.41
yeah didn't even get to the point where

785.87 --> 791.41
I could said it was good

793.59 --> 805.32
Oh God yeah Jeremiah it's a really basic

800.25 --> 809.029
setup it's it's just a little you did

805.32 --> 813.089
with little window in a multi window

809.029 --> 816.15
from the door and from what I've

813.089 --> 818.58
gathered I think like the wood parts are

816.15 --> 821.91
on the outside so it's gonna actually

818.58 --> 823.5600000000001
kind of damage in the paint job don't

821.91 --> 827.01
know how to fix that yet but we'll see

823.56 --> 830.76
about that later I got some tips on how

827.01 --> 832.8
to remove it I got all the equipment for

830.76 --> 834.45
that I kind of have to like do it but

832.8 --> 837.9599999999999
then I thought like yeah I can do all so

834.45 --> 840.089
I can like do my early bird on time and

837.96 --> 843.779
just continue after that and they'll

840.089 --> 846.5400000000001
still be in time to get it all done or

843.779 --> 855.98
most of it and it'll be finished

846.54 --> 855.98
tomorrow for sure I think so so yeah

860.87 --> 869.75
right trafficking my arrest had I don't

867.08 --> 872.21
know it's just it is what it is I

869.75 --> 874.55
already I don't want to get too much

872.21 --> 877.94
into all this infighting it's just that

874.55 --> 880.6099999999999
the whole situation yesterday Riley with

877.94 --> 882.47
Dell that was just hilarious that was

880.61 --> 886.88
like really funny because there was

882.47 --> 888.88
being quite paranoid thinking that yeah

886.88 --> 893.66
he was the target

888.88 --> 896.0
well while Riley clearly set him up set

893.66 --> 897.89
it up and I remember that hangout when

896.0 --> 902.38
he refused to say who he was talking

897.89 --> 905.39
about it I was like oh it was it and

902.38 --> 911.21
it's just funny that Dell just totally

905.39 --> 913.13
tumbled into it it was really stupid and

911.21 --> 916.33
to me was kind of funny to see it

913.13 --> 919.33
because it was basically Dell

916.33 --> 923.75
complaining and talking about a video

919.33 --> 924.62
where Riley was in and I was into and he

923.75 --> 929.39
would mention me

924.62 --> 931.94
and then Ronnie would yeah show the

929.39 --> 935.63
video of them showing the video of him

931.94 --> 942.47
and then also reference me so it almost

935.63 --> 945.98
felt like wasn't it kind of felt like

942.47 --> 948.02
this like Dell and Riley were basically

945.98 --> 953.33
pulling on my arms while this while

948.02 --> 954.86
arguing like how dare you attack me and

953.33 --> 957.9200000000001
Arwen is playing the devil's advocate

954.86 --> 960.74
and Riley I wasn't attacking you and I

957.92 --> 963.62
don't agree with our win with many

960.74 --> 967.45
things yeah it was just funny it was

963.62 --> 967.45
really funny to sit through that

969.04 --> 979.0999999999999
but yeah the whole situation with with

972.2 --> 981.589
Bob and Nathan you know it's one

979.1 --> 984.98
everybody that this paste that has paid

981.589 --> 987.23
a little attention knows that these two

984.98 --> 990.1700000000001
just don't naturally go along with one

987.23 --> 992.66
another and yeah they've had many

990.17 --> 996.29
arguments usually in chat and such

992.66 --> 1000.42
before and we all know what the setup

996.29 --> 1005.769
was Nathan is very much on the words and

1000.42 --> 1011.17
trying to fight the illusion of science

1005.769 --> 1014.079
being an authority and yeah Bob at the

1011.17 --> 1016.209
same time is just trying to figure out

1014.079 --> 1020.79
basically the mechanics of this world

1016.209 --> 1026.98
but still yeah basically using the form

1020.79 --> 1031.809
the format of of scientism because that

1026.98 --> 1035.6200000000001
makes yeah you make more constructive

1031.809 --> 1037.99
progress in in what you're trying to

1035.62 --> 1040.27
figure out except yet to then claim it

1037.99 --> 1044.949
is scientific proof that's just wrong

1040.27 --> 1046.9
that's stupid that's that's backwards

1044.949 --> 1050.0800000000002
and you have no surprise that Nathan

1046.9 --> 1056.63
went off on him and of course Bob being

1050.08 --> 1061.32
Bob would not accept that and get like

1056.63 --> 1062.7
yeah get all defensive so yeah that sort

1061.32 --> 1065.07
of thing was bound to happen in my

1062.7 --> 1066.21
opinion there's there's not much more to

1065.07 --> 1071.01
say about it

1066.21 --> 1073.47
I just hope that that Bob will actually

1071.01 --> 1076.76
like carefully think about it and like

1073.47 --> 1079.95
trying to see if he can change his

1076.76 --> 1082.3799999999999
approach somehow it's probably gonna be

1079.95 --> 1086.6000000000001
tough for him because he's just used to

1082.38 --> 1086.6000000000001
doing things his own way a lot

1090.55 --> 1096.6699999999998
oh really I look I had ya Rasta I

1094.33 --> 1099.85
haven't actually seen the thing I came

1096.67 --> 1104.91
in globe busters like after Nathan it

1099.85 --> 1104.9099999999999
left and just going by what I heard

1108.06 --> 1112.69
so yeah Hey look if you want to talk

1110.71 --> 1115.3
about it you talk about it okay that's

1112.69 --> 1118.3600000000001
what you find so interesting I'm not

1115.3 --> 1120.1599999999999
really interesting in fighting things in

1118.36 --> 1122.4599999999998
general unless they're really freaking

1120.16 --> 1122.46
funny

1128.96 --> 1133.75
[Music]

1130.75 --> 1133.75
so

1133.84 --> 1143.7099999999998
yeah Nathan is awesome and everything he

1141.1 --> 1147.37
said afterward was just yeah what's just

1143.71 --> 1149.88
right it was good and a good reason to

1147.37 --> 1152.9499999999998
do what he did

1149.88 --> 1157.8700000000001
although yeah it may be kind of little

1152.95 --> 1162.63
bit out of place but yeah that's you

1157.87 --> 1162.6299999999999
know upholding a certain standard

1178.45 --> 1181.45
so

1183.78 --> 1189.54
what else not gonna make this a long

1186.69 --> 1191.49
hangout because I need the time after

1189.54 --> 1194.34
this probably not even gonna join the

1191.49 --> 1198.39
bed I'm just gonna try to move on with

1194.34 --> 1200.55
with the front door window situation try

1198.39 --> 1203.8500000000001
to get that done in time so I can still

1200.55 --> 1205.71
order the piece of glass and then yeah

1203.85 --> 1209.4599999999998
if that works out I probably finish up

1205.71 --> 1212.16
most in the evening kind of looking

1209.46 --> 1219.14
forward to that then otherwise it's

1212.16 --> 1219.14
gonna be tomorrow right well anyway

1223.07 --> 1227.23
I just feel so much calmer now

1232.78 --> 1239.08
oh yeah also looking forward to getting

1235.96 --> 1242.71
my new pants in three days yeah this

1239.08 --> 1244.4499999999998
Friday we're looking forward to that

1242.71 --> 1246.93
like these pants I'm wearing they're

1244.45 --> 1249.97
like two large and it's annoying and

1246.93 --> 1251.53
it's a hassle and oh yeah they are at

1249.97 --> 1254.83
least they don't have holes in them

1251.53 --> 1257.1
they're just not my size and I can I

1254.83 --> 1261.22
constantly notice it's really annoying

1257.1 --> 1265.02
so I can't wait to get some proper

1261.22 --> 1265.02
custom fitting pants

1267.0 --> 1272.559
[Music]

1268.48 --> 1272.559
oh yeah

1272.59 --> 1276.28
special requests

1286.49 --> 1306.35
this is awesome I got another Illuminati

1290.64 --> 1306.3500000000001
Castle so don't enjoy that Thanks hmm

1308.09 --> 1311.09
nice

1321.94 --> 1328.38
[Applause]

1324.35 --> 1332.76
and food video nah it's a food video I'm

1328.38 --> 1342.3600000000001
just I'm eating eating stuff doesn't

1332.76 --> 1345.32
make it a food video sorry it is a

1342.36 --> 1345.32
breakfast show you know

1374.82 --> 1382.039
what do I do for a living yeah good II

1377.929 --> 1382.039
already said that yesterday

1386.38 --> 1389.2800000000002
not much

1393.73 --> 1403.539
my main focus has been pretty much from

1396.58 --> 1406.87
the start to pursue interest to develop

1403.539 --> 1413.08
skills to try and yeah build myself up

1406.87 --> 1415.9289999999999
in useful way and then must be find a

1413.08 --> 1419.22
way in or just wait for opportunity and

1415.929 --> 1419.22
then apply myself

1422.23 --> 1430.06
working for a living just that concept

1424.96 --> 1432.49
never really got through to me to the

1430.06 --> 1435.04
disappointment of my family which is

1432.49 --> 1443.5
like very like you have to work for a

1435.04 --> 1449.56
living and yeah I've enjoyed some real

1443.5 --> 1451.87
[ __ ] over that and I like inside I have

1449.56 --> 1457.06
a strong tendency also to persecute

1451.87 --> 1460.6599999999999
myself over it but none of it really

1457.06 --> 1463.23
helped me to actually get out of it so I

1460.66 --> 1463.23
don't know

1466.26 --> 1470.3
I'll try to and find a way through it

1472.56 --> 1477.2
well I know chocolate

1481.029 --> 1486.04
right

1482.53 --> 1488.23
yeah I let about Dell again you know I

1486.04 --> 1489.6399999999999
don't really follow him because yeah

1488.23 --> 1492.34
when it comes to actual information

1489.64 --> 1494.8500000000001
there's not a lot there never has been

1492.34 --> 1499.84
the guy really doesn't know how to

1494.85 --> 1501.85
discuss anything anything I can't have a

1499.84 --> 1504.58
discussion with him about anything

1501.85 --> 1506.11
except complaining how everything how

1504.58 --> 1507.97
everyone else does everything wrong

1506.11 --> 1511.81
that's the only thing he seems to be

1507.97 --> 1515.65
capable of discussing but when it comes

1511.81 --> 1518.95
to content he just doesn't stick I tried

1515.65 --> 1521.0500000000002
I went on there a couple of times tried

1518.95 --> 1523.27
to be really nice and positive and then

1521.05 --> 1525.22
like Oh what do you think looking at the

1523.27 --> 1527.98
possibilities with this and that and you

1525.22 --> 1530.71
would just say like yeah this just

1527.98 --> 1532.15
sounds like a bunch of gobbledygook it's

1530.71 --> 1535.0900000000001
not gonna help us put a guess in

1532.15 --> 1542.92
anything you know that's kind of a waste

1535.09 --> 1544.8999999999999
of a time so yeah I don't know it just

1542.92 --> 1548.47
never thought it was very constructive

1544.9 --> 1551.95
and Dell just does his thing the funny

1548.47 --> 1555.43
thing is though that when he like goes

1551.95 --> 1558.31
off on people and like starts to try

1555.43 --> 1562.96
this [ __ ] over them he does it in a

1558.31 --> 1565.96
freaking hilarious way like you over

1562.96 --> 1567.8500000000001
does it and probably even doesn't

1565.96 --> 1572.41
realize that it's just really funny

1567.85 --> 1574.3899999999999
seeing him do that like that's where the

1572.41 --> 1577.23
whole Dell dolphin thing came from

1574.39 --> 1577.23
earlier

1580.74 --> 1587.29
it just gets so silly when he's like tie

1584.17 --> 1589.15
rating about people even though he's not

1587.29 --> 1594.1299999999999
doing it for a good reason it's still

1589.15 --> 1595.93
freaking funny and that's just yeah I

1594.13 --> 1599.47
don't know that's just a weird little

1595.93 --> 1601.99
Charmy as it's like his it's his lucky

1599.47 --> 1603.1000000000001
charm so what keeps him going that he's

1601.99 --> 1610.05
actually funny

1603.1 --> 1614.4599999999998
but yeah he is he doesn't really get

1610.05 --> 1617.01
funny like I don't think he's a very

1614.46 --> 1622.75
comedic guy he's it's just an

1617.01 --> 1625.03
intentional side effect because like the

1622.75 --> 1628.15
most I've ever seen him laugh or

1625.03 --> 1628.51
something about a joke is just smiling a

1628.15 --> 1631.45
little

1628.51 --> 1633.1299999999999
omus oppressively like he does get it he

1631.45 --> 1638.6100000000001
just doesn't want to express it because

1633.13 --> 1642.3400000000001
he just want to be serious and yeah I

1638.61 --> 1645.4799999999998
know Dell is what he is and that's what

1642.34 --> 1645.48
he wants to do apparently

1648.19 --> 1655.75
and it does feel like he's been of a

1651.09 --> 1658.99
Blowfish here and there that yeah as

1655.75 --> 1661.81
Riley said it he is kind of a bit of a

1658.99 --> 1664.15
coward in a way and then be trying to

1661.81 --> 1668.1599999999999
act all manly to kind of I'll do that

1664.15 --> 1668.16
yeah you know

1671.58 --> 1680.46
but I guess that he's just kind of

1674.399 --> 1683.7589999999998
rusted in place getting rusty and I have

1680.46 --> 1686.07
that too like yeah for me like I needed

1683.759 --> 1688.379
somebody to actually remind me like oh

1686.07 --> 1691.86
yeah you can actually do something

1688.379 --> 1694.529
yourself that hadn't even occurred to me

1691.86 --> 1698.369
and then I had to like almost reboot

1694.529 --> 1700.919
like okay wait options I can do things

1698.369 --> 1702.9289999999999
myself now I have to remember how that

1700.919 --> 1708.48
works again getting to actually that

1702.929 --> 1710.3990000000001
routine the improvisation finding a

1708.48 --> 1713.119
creative solution and using my

1710.399 --> 1715.859
analytical skills to plan things out I

1713.119 --> 1718.549
had to like reboot that in my mind I

1715.859 --> 1722.279
haven't really done that in a while

1718.549 --> 1725.46
in a serious way then I think that Dells

1722.279 --> 1731.07
probably kind of rusted in place in the

1725.46 --> 1733.6490000000001
same way or me maybe worse so it just

1731.07 --> 1736.549
doesn't seem like a very socially

1733.649 --> 1736.549
flexible person

1737.85 --> 1740.869
but I don't know

1742.91 --> 1749.03
the island I don't really think he's

1746.12 --> 1752.3
like really a shield or something to

1749.03 --> 1756.44
suggest that to create the vision I

1752.3 --> 1760.24
don't know I I think he just tends to

1756.44 --> 1760.24
have a natural tendency to do that

1777.54 --> 1785.19
I don't think though is really a scary

1779.94 --> 1786.72
guy I think he likes to put on a scary

1785.19 --> 1789.23
image and I think that he's actually

1786.72 --> 1789.23
just

1792.46 --> 1796.05
very young at heart

1799.419 --> 1805.269
yeah doesn't other than like deflecting

1803.2 --> 1809.499
his own ego problems he doesn't really

1805.269 --> 1812.019
know any and he Speights real Speights

1809.499 --> 1814.209
toward other people that he would

1812.019 --> 1816.8990000000001
physically act out I don't think he's

1814.209 --> 1816.8990000000001
like that at all

1832.67 --> 1837.0700000000002
look I don't street fight anyone

1841.23 --> 1852.75
you know look how mostly just try to

1846.539 --> 1857.37
avoid conflict work it out or walk away

1852.75 --> 1859.59
or yeah I'm not gonna go in a fight if

1857.37 --> 1862.2299999999998
something like that would be unavoidable

1859.59 --> 1866.549
I would just take them out as quickly as

1862.23 --> 1870.5
possible I don't get into fights because

1866.549 --> 1873.059
I don't have to build for that I

1870.5 --> 1878.899
wouldn't last very long if I'd really

1873.059 --> 1878.899
like a fight you know

1888.91 --> 1892.99
no I'm not going to change it into the

1890.98 --> 1896.2
breakfast show and I'm not gonna be

1892.99 --> 1898.5
eating Illuminati car songs every single

1896.2 --> 1898.5
time

1904.69 --> 1911.66
yeah Julia Bennet says she could take

1907.73 --> 1914.08
Dale probably he wouldn't know what to

1911.66 --> 1920.03
do with a girl actually opposed him

1914.08 --> 1923.6299999999999
probably be able to take about because

1920.03 --> 1926.87
yeah he has a big mouth the words women

1923.63 --> 1929.0
definitely kind of shameless at that but

1926.87 --> 1932.2099999999998
that's not if he'd had one in front of

1929.0 --> 1937.48
them I I doubt that he'd dare that to do

1932.21 --> 1937.48
that they'll just has a very big mouth

1941.92 --> 1947.95
now come on Mill G or self to get into

1952.29 --> 1958.79
it's terrible why they are shooting

1954.0 --> 1958.79
people with arrows you know

1979.58 --> 1988.1
no Judy Bennett you wouldn't crumble

1982.429 --> 1992.1490000000001
like a piece of paper you underestimate

1988.1 --> 1999.769
yourself besides it Dell is not that big

1992.149 --> 2003.4799999999998
a guy and I bet if you were in his

1999.769 --> 2003.48
physical presence you'd feel it

2015.34 --> 2022.759
writes the drôme a god the app Dell is

2019.309 --> 2023.36
just your average sweetie sock he kind

2022.759 --> 2026.659
of is

2023.36 --> 2029.9599999999998
that's a funny thing but if it just

2026.659 --> 2035.0900000000001
keeps on talking and being all bluster

2029.96 --> 2037.8790000000001
and I'm so intimidating very serious and

2035.09 --> 2045.309
all that yeah then me your kind of gifts

2037.879 --> 2045.309
off this image like he's a big man but I

2046.179 --> 2049.779
doubt it'll stand

2091.1 --> 2093.1
Oh

2093.74 --> 2100.27
right yeah I don't oh where do you mean

2098.359 --> 2110.089
sweaty sir

2100.27 --> 2113.32
right yeah I misread that let me read

2110.089 --> 2113.32
that in the right context

2119.22 --> 2129.3289999999997
your average sweaty stuff but I think

2125.55 --> 2133.53
that Dell is probably inside kind of a

2129.329 --> 2138.75
sweetheart but his ego she is constantly

2133.53 --> 2142.94
playing him because there this guy has

2138.75 --> 2142.94
some self-esteem issues for sure

2145.45 --> 2152.7599999999998
you know in a way so do i box I'm not

2149.74 --> 2152.7599999999998
trying to hide it

2156.329 --> 2164.1090000000004
I'm not trying to pimp myself up to try

2162.19 --> 2166.799
to camouflage it in any way that's the

2164.109 --> 2166.799
difference

2206.15 --> 2215.859
anyway I'm putting out the the link for

2212.539 --> 2215.8590000000004
anyone who wants to join

2248.68 --> 2256.94
it's a slang for job

2251.49 --> 2256.9399999999996
which means Scottish I'm not getting it

2261.58 --> 2268.69
this is like some weird intricate inter

2264.79 --> 2274.75
English stuff like that happened between

2268.69 --> 2278.68
them yesterday too it is like Dell

2274.75 --> 2280.99
called Riley certain things that seemed

2278.68 --> 2282.64
like okay that seems like a silly thing

2280.99 --> 2286.8399999999997
to say but apparently that had this

2282.64 --> 2288.8799999999997
intricate meaning within English region

2286.84 --> 2293.05
versus English region and then Riley

2288.88 --> 2295.9900000000002
responded with the appropriate same

2293.05 --> 2299.5800000000004
level type of thinking in this like out

2295.99 --> 2299.58
of my league I don't get that at all

2301.83 --> 2306.12
yeah I'm still Dutch you know I

2306.88 --> 2312.58
I kind of get the average English

2309.01 --> 2314.9500000000003
English language when it comes to like

2312.58 --> 2318.72
these weird specific local insults and

2314.95 --> 2318.72
everything I have no idea

2366.57 --> 2371.82
I still don't know what that pie eater

2368.67 --> 2374.76
actually is supposed to be meaning it

2371.82 --> 2378.69
just to me I'm first glance it just

2374.76 --> 2381.78
seems like somebody who just eats too

2378.69 --> 2383.16
much and becomes fat or something does

2381.78 --> 2386.0600000000004
that actually mean that or is there

2383.16 --> 2386.06
something else to it

2398.44 --> 2401.9700000000003
yeah sure my girl

2411.01 --> 2414.4500000000003
truth seeker mafia

2414.64 --> 2418.33
I don't remember for sure but I think

2416.41 --> 2421.0899999999997
that I was actually on the Little

2418.33 --> 2424.0299999999997
Busters one time but I'm not a hundred

2421.09 --> 2426.06
percent sure if I was it was some time

2424.03 --> 2426.0600000000004
ago

2505.359 --> 2508.17
talking about

2510.9 --> 2518.46
right Michael raw thanks for the advice

2513.76 --> 2518.46
I do work out and yeah it does help

2521.03 --> 2526.3900000000003
but yeah to really get back into it

2524.76 --> 2529.42
because

2526.39 --> 2532.6
I've been kind of kind of in like a

2529.42 --> 2535.06
depression cycle you could call it and

2532.6 --> 2537.31
yeah your body's not working along when

2535.06 --> 2540.45
you do that and working out it doesn't

2537.31 --> 2540.45
really help a lot

2541.0 --> 2546.24
yeah think I'm getting out of that

2543.79 --> 2546.24
completely

2546.28 --> 2554.4100000000003
so I just do typical things like

2548.89 --> 2556.3599999999997
push-ups and sit-ups and as I do that

2554.41 --> 2560.02
like try to figure out what else is

2556.36 --> 2563.1
going on my body and basically improvise

2560.02 --> 2563.1
and yeah that's fine

2563.98 --> 2567.119
I don't count him

2569.75 --> 2578.17
like 20 years ago or so I used to be

2572.39 --> 2581.8399999999997
able to do like 60 or 70 or something

2578.17 --> 2584.1800000000003
yeah those were the days but yeah if I

2581.84 --> 2588.05
want to get there I'd really have to go

2584.18 --> 2591.85
fanatically train to get there it's

2588.05 --> 2591.8500000000004
probably not gonna happen anytime soon

2594.91 --> 2604.75
so for now I'll settle with ten to

2600.009 --> 2609.279
twenty if I don't over stress if I don't

2604.75 --> 2612.22
overstrain myself because it still has

2609.279 --> 2614.859
to build slowly can't like I can't just

2612.22 --> 2618.0389999999998
expect to go work out and then instantly

2614.859 --> 2620.529
everything just works out although yeah

2618.039 --> 2623.1400000000003
my muscles when I do trade they grow

2620.529 --> 2626.589
quickly I don't know it's genetic I

2623.14 --> 2628.98
think but I can build muscles pretty

2626.589 --> 2628.98
quickly

2630.53 --> 2635.5
it's just when I do I also need to eat

2633.23 --> 2635.5
more

2641.02 --> 2649.5
oh yeah I used to be quite a fanatical

2643.39 --> 2652.95
swimmer also but yeah swimming pools

2649.5 --> 2655.1
taurine and everything it's not good for

2652.95 --> 2655.1
me

2657.68 --> 2663.249
though I used to like swimming in the

2668.22 --> 2676.4399999999996
the ocean the Mediterranean ocean isn't

2671.099 --> 2678.69
called again that's a really salt ocean

2676.44 --> 2682.819
and swimming Dara was like really

2678.69 --> 2682.819
awesome is actually good for your skin

2698.36 --> 2700.78
yeah

2701.62 --> 2710.62
okay August subsections called the

2706.21 --> 2713.86
Balearic see just the way the

2710.62 --> 2716.47
mediterranean sea it's generally right

2713.86 --> 2719.1400000000003
that's C is very salt compared to

2716.47 --> 2723.0699999999997
everything else and yeah that's actually

2719.14 --> 2728.2
quite good for the skin to swimming even

2723.07 --> 2730.21
though there is also just junk but yeah

2728.2 --> 2733.98
the minerals in there making actually

2730.21 --> 2733.98
quite good to swimming

2742.119 --> 2748.6000000000004
all right Jeremiah yeah it did

2751.25 --> 2760.289
and yeah again I have a lot concerning

2756.059 --> 2762.4100000000003
the whole grantee being woken up to the

2760.289 --> 2766.259
other dimension and everything in dreams

2762.41 --> 2774.019
yeah I have huge amounts of stuff in

2766.259 --> 2774.0190000000002
there and it's tough like

2775.05 --> 2782.52
it's it's tough on me to deal with it in

2779.01 --> 2788.1600000000003
general although I'm kind of used to it

2782.52 --> 2790.95
so it's not that tough but also there is

2788.16 --> 2794.2799999999997
just stuff in there in my memories that

2790.95 --> 2798.75
are just dangerous like I don't fully

2794.28 --> 2801.27
understand the context and feels like

2798.75 --> 2804.45
I've been poking my nose in places to

2801.27 --> 2808.43
like discover things but that that

2804.45 --> 2808.43
knowledge is actually kind of dangerous

2808.97 --> 2815.9399999999996
so I'm always just trying to be careful

2813.02 --> 2818.25
Randy was just going fall in just like

2815.94 --> 2821.69
drowning in the discovery of the new

2818.25 --> 2825.66
realm basically to him and I get that

2821.69 --> 2830.64
but I should be careful because the

2825.66 --> 2835.0099999999998
other realm yeah if you get into that

2830.64 --> 2835.0099999999998
and you just get over enthusiastic

2835.599 --> 2840.489
are you not careful then yeah there's

2837.819 --> 2842.859
it's not without danger that entire

2840.489 --> 2847.73
realm can be incredibly dangerous if you

2842.859 --> 2852.3199999999997
don't watch out

2847.73 --> 2854.54
so yeah it kind of freaked me out and

2852.32 --> 2859.329
also yeah there's just other things

2854.54 --> 2859.329
about that that whole thing like how

2861.44 --> 2869.66
the concept of yeah meeting a new guy

2864.98 --> 2872.93
and then telling him that much on first

2869.66 --> 2877.0699999999997
encounter and that's something I would

2872.93 --> 2881.6499999999996
never do and it seemed like he to me

2877.07 --> 2886.31
like the guy drew it that's just Colin

2881.65 --> 2889.4
pushed it to a blatantly irresponsible

2886.31 --> 2892.82
level and I would never catch myself

2889.4 --> 2897.26
doing that and that's what worried me

2892.82 --> 2901.4
about it mostly at first and some other

2897.26 --> 2904.73
elements as well just very intuitively

2901.4 --> 2909.92
any I was confirmed that's not the end

2904.73 --> 2912.62
of it I feel I'd still kind of need to

2909.92 --> 2916.82
contact him and just figure out who he

2912.62 --> 2918.77
is and what he's actually doing when he

2916.82 --> 2922.04
thinks he's doing and what he's actually

2918.77 --> 2924.94
doing whether he's aware of it or not

2922.04 --> 2929.62
that kind of thing I just

2924.94 --> 2933.64
use my Oracle powers to really see

2929.62 --> 2936.46
what's going on there but yeah it's

2933.64 --> 2938.8199999999997
don't have any time for that on the

2936.46 --> 2938.82
short run

2939.68 --> 2944.98
[Music]

2940.95 --> 2948.8689999999997
because even though he may have been

2944.98 --> 2953.64
some kind of like superhero or whatever

2948.869 --> 2958.299
there's probably still things about him

2953.64 --> 2960.0989999999997
the good elements about him and I don't

2958.299 --> 2962.14
feel like it should be like immediately

2960.099 --> 2964.96
just shoving that all to the side and

2962.14 --> 2967.089
say what's evil it's not so

2964.96 --> 2969.9
straightforward I think think it's a

2967.089 --> 2969.9
little bit more complicated

2980.68 --> 2990.6699999999996
right okay Tamiya stinker remember

2987.52 --> 2995.44
antique saying that he said he was of

2990.67 --> 2997.779
the old bloodline off the old druids so

2995.44 --> 3000.15
yeah that kind of makes him a druid that

2997.779 --> 3003.109
sense and though he may not be a British

3000.15 --> 3008.059
inning druid in the traditional sense

3003.109 --> 3008.0589999999997
but yeah what are you gonna call him

3031.93 --> 3038.049
but it's interesting like apparently the

3035.68 --> 3042.819
Omega knows more about the real turret

3038.049 --> 3045.97
tradition yeah I to be fair I don't know

3042.819 --> 3049.48
too much about it like the details of it

3045.97 --> 3052.8089999999997
the more high-end the details in the

3049.48 --> 3056.039
other dimensional that just a more

3052.809 --> 3059.98
generalized conception I have

3056.039 --> 3065.98
entertained it and probably upon hearing

3059.98 --> 3067.9900000000002
what would be required stepped away but

3065.98 --> 3070.049
I don't remember any of the details of

3067.99 --> 3070.049
that

3072.109 --> 3079.339
I just know I have a lot of sympathy for

3076.249 --> 3082.069
plants and animals and I feel like I can

3079.339 --> 3089.3289999999997
tune into them very carefully I have a

3082.069 --> 3093.199
natural hunger for nature's lore in

3089.329 --> 3095.529
psychology and healing and it just all

3093.199 --> 3095.529
fits

3099.74 --> 3102.8799999999997
yeah no singing

3111.23 --> 3115.119
I don't know what to sing anyway

3135.99 --> 3141.75
it's quite a world of difference from

3138.76 --> 3141.75
yesterday anything

3143.65 --> 3149.38
oh yeah another little detail by the way

3147.13 --> 3153.79
that was funny in one of the videos that

3149.38 --> 3157.12
vision forwarded to me apparently like

3153.79 --> 3158.04
Max Planck at some point had a brilliant

3157.12 --> 3162.52
statement

3158.04 --> 3167.59
we're basically criticized the science

3162.52 --> 3173.32
community for falsely assuming that the

3167.59 --> 3175.57
Sun would have a temperature because he

3173.32 --> 3178.2400000000002
was basically implying that the Sun is

3175.57 --> 3180.07
holographic and that it's only the light

3178.24 --> 3183.43
that actually has the energy at night

3180.07 --> 3187.69
I love that because that's what I've

3183.43 --> 3189.85
been saying like yeah it's actually the

3187.69 --> 3192.37
light hitting you that produces the heat

3189.85 --> 3195.6
you can prove that that Sun is like a

3192.37 --> 3198.19
lamp radiated meat look and he said it

3195.6 --> 3201.64
said it like more than a hundred years

3198.19 --> 3204.21
ago it is so cool to read that back so

3201.64 --> 3204.21
awesome

3209.61 --> 3213.26
now I didn't promise anything

3236.32 --> 3238.92
well

3244.44 --> 3250.13
all right the morning study oral

3247.53 --> 3250.13
tradition

3254.64 --> 3263.069
do they say what the point to it is to

3257.849 --> 3264.8900000000003
studying it seven years seems like a bit

3263.069 --> 3267.42
tedious

3264.89 --> 3269.73
although yeah you know if I got a p900

3267.42 --> 3272.39
that would make it a lot easier and more

3269.73 --> 3272.39
interesting

3279.03 --> 3285.9300000000003
but I do remember from the whole weekend

3281.58 --> 3287.97
thing that yeah that's the place I first

3285.93 --> 3291.4199999999996
heard that moonlight was actually cold

3287.97 --> 3293.7799999999997
and they also did tell me the earth was

3291.42 --> 3297.54
flat but I wasn't really accepted of it

3293.78 --> 3301.86
just went along for it to just move me

3297.54 --> 3304.86
on but yeah the moon that seems to be

3301.86 --> 3306.92
important thing for them and they also

3304.86 --> 3310.61
emphasize it religiously and

3306.92 --> 3313.8
symbolically but there's more to it but

3310.61 --> 3317.28
I I don't know too much like I stepped

3313.8 --> 3319.7000000000003
out pretty quickly after certain things

3317.28 --> 3319.7000000000003
happen

3322.93 --> 3331.19
mainly the the high priestess and the

3328.43 --> 3335.96
high priest leaders of our group

3331.19 --> 3341.3
basically got into serious serious to

3335.96 --> 3344.78
violence level yeah marital arguments

3341.3 --> 3349.19
like that was so shattering they went

3344.78 --> 3352.13
nuts especially the woman that after

3349.19 --> 3353.75
that point it's like okay let's just let

3352.13 --> 3358.6600000000003
them get through this we're gonna do

3353.75 --> 3358.66
something else so how'd that happen

3394.45 --> 3397.74
guys we're getting weird

3404.17 --> 3413.38
yeah well the Mesa L only the Y's Nixon

3411.04 --> 3416.98
supposedly called through a landline

3413.38 --> 3421.08
that would then transfer using a

3416.98 --> 3425.88
transmitter to satellite or something

3421.08 --> 3428.5
transfer me to direct relay or yeah

3425.88 --> 3433.2400000000002
that's how it supposedly works that's

3428.5 --> 3435.43
why the delay was there but yeah it was

3433.24 --> 3438.85
actually just land light to the building

3435.43 --> 3442.47
right next and they just put a delay

3438.85 --> 3442.47
system that's

3449.67 --> 3455.7000000000003
but yeah I think that of course they had

3452.64 --> 3457.71
radio transmitters back then and yeah

3455.7 --> 3460.1299999999997
shouldn't be too hard to put it

3457.71 --> 3464.67
telephone

3460.13 --> 3467.67
sounds data band into a radio signal

3464.67 --> 3470.7000000000003
really doesn't have to be high quality

3467.67 --> 3475.349
sound that's passing through that and it

3470.7 --> 3477.509
wasn't so doesn't mean it's real though

3475.349 --> 3480.17
it just means it was kind of technically

3477.509 --> 3484.069
possible at the time so that's why they

3480.17 --> 3484.069
put that in there

3507.67 --> 3511.59
the PPC wasn't that

3526.83 --> 3533.5499999999997
right well Chris mapped in in a certain

3529.59 --> 3534.7200000000003
sense the different polarized charges of

3533.55 --> 3544.26
the Sun and Moon yeah that makes perfect

3534.72 --> 3547.3999999999996
sense to me intuitively and also yeah

3544.26 --> 3547.4
relating to the

3551.32 --> 3561.6600000000003
ah it's a name again

3568.989 --> 3576.89
tattooin yeah you had the Russell's

3573.079 --> 3582.279
video it's the name again my god Asians

3576.89 --> 3582.279
been really spamming my chat lots

3584.29 --> 3589.93
very long conversation yesterday great

3587.68 --> 3593.85
videos about plasma physics as well

3589.93 --> 3593.85
you're really fascinating

3597.849 --> 3613.049
yeah Walter Russell so yeah makes sense

3601.089 --> 3613.049
that two opposition's creating one thing

3619.41 --> 3624.12
right okay Chris Matt when I say globe

3622.72 --> 3626.7099999999996
of the heavens

3624.12 --> 3628.87
it's basically always gonna be a damn I

3626.71 --> 3632.86
hope because you can never see stars

3628.87 --> 3635.41
beneath half of it but because we know

3632.86 --> 3637.7200000000003
how they rotate and that there's like

3635.41 --> 3639.85
two sides that can be visible

3637.72 --> 3643.93
I say it's a globe but you basically

3639.85 --> 3646.5099999999998
only get to see a demagogue and I called

3643.93 --> 3652.4199999999996
the globe because I'm pretty convinced

3646.51 --> 3655.8700000000003
that all the light apparitions are at an

3652.42 --> 3659.59
equal apparent distance in relation to

3655.87 --> 3662.62
the observer making them like a dome at

3659.59 --> 3665.56
the edge of vision there are our parents

3662.62 --> 3671.14
there's no literal location about them

3665.56 --> 3675.67
about any of it so that's why I call it

3671.14 --> 3677.87
a global of the heavens and it does seem

3675.67 --> 3680.81
to

3677.87 --> 3684.62
have a spinning nature and that may be

3680.81 --> 3688.67
somehow either related or it's probably

3684.62 --> 3692.96
gonna be magnetics and potentially

3688.67 --> 3696.67
plasma physics related yeah saw some

3692.96 --> 3696.67
video that gave me some compelling

3697.63 --> 3704.4100000000003
indications of that because things you

3700.49 --> 3707.2999999999997
can do with plasma it's very fascinating

3704.41 --> 3714.02
the patterns that can come out of that

3707.3 --> 3717.23
they do remind us of and yeah of the

3714.02 --> 3719.18
star phenomena and even like the deeper

3717.23 --> 3722.54
pictures where you mostly see other

3719.18 --> 3726.29
galaxies all these patterns seem to be

3722.54 --> 3728.5099999999998
somehow derived from this guy's

3726.29 --> 3732.47
literally derived from plasma physics

3728.51 --> 3736.9100000000003
because it kind of looks like that they

3732.47 --> 3739.91
suggest that all the universe maybe it's

3736.91 --> 3743.6299999999997
maybe like a microcosm of the microcosm

3739.91 --> 3746.42
of plasma physics while we have giving

3743.63 --> 3749.77
it from a space universe perspective but

3746.42 --> 3749.77
there may be something to it

3756.85 --> 3763.41
why are you mine evil villain from the

3758.89 --> 3763.41
Disney movie what the hell

3770.94 --> 3777.91
you know it's

3773.6 --> 3777.91
it's because I'm wearing black isn't it

3781.24 --> 3789.2599999999998
have eyebrows and now I have a mustache

3784.76 --> 3795.4700000000003
as well and I'm wearing black so I must

3789.26 --> 3797.96
be evil by Disney logic because yeah

3795.47 --> 3800.89
they also always think that gothics are

3797.96 --> 3800.89
always evil

3817.58 --> 3823.25
