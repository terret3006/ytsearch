108.32 --> 119.63999999999999

111.96 --> 125.88
okay this should be better right so

119.64 --> 136.62
today I got coffee again thank God -

125.88 --> 140.07
Mara coffee to be precise aunty took

136.62 --> 143.58
another brain force for good measure and

140.07 --> 150.32999999999998
I don't regret it so let's see who is in

143.58 --> 154.37
chat Steve was first all kinds of links

150.33 --> 159.45000000000002
really good videos about the CGI of

154.37 --> 161.42000000000002
space movies like gravity yeah was well

159.45 --> 164.6
worth watching thank you for that Steve

161.42 --> 164.6
Amanda young

166.13 --> 176.4
and then my chat is broken again my cat

171.959 --> 179.13
chat in the venue tube seamstick break

176.4 --> 181.68
although the long chat that is part of

179.13 --> 185.35999999999999
the early bird show invisible is not

181.68 --> 187.95000000000002
breaking anyway

185.36 --> 192.86
drunken bullet for one one Geoffrey Bill

187.95 --> 197.82
del West Watson over Markov matrix media

192.86 --> 200.66000000000003
yeah good to see you all just give

197.82 --> 200.66
anyone right no

201.56 --> 211.58
so yeah yesterday was crazy and to be

208.52 --> 215.09
fair I still kind of am although this

211.58 --> 220.01000000000002
time I managed to meet with my social

215.09 --> 222.53
worker which finally happened only took

220.01 --> 226.39999999999998
one and a half week before I could

222.53 --> 229.61
finally reach him anyway I put forward

226.4 --> 234.01000000000002
to plan and you kind of agreed so I'm

229.61 --> 240.769
gonna do that and I'm gonna do it fast

234.01 --> 243.32
and when it's done it's done because I

240.769 --> 246.83
was right there is a lot of need for

243.32 --> 251.39
work and it's widely available

246.83 --> 253.25
apparently currently so yeah it's the

251.39 --> 257.209
need is to the level where they really

253.25 --> 259.13
don't care what your resume is they just

257.209 --> 261.41
care if you're available and if you do a

259.13 --> 264.26
good job and that's exactly what I need

261.41 --> 267.32000000000005
and when I do that and when I can use

264.26 --> 272.03
that to finally stabilize elf stabilize

267.32 --> 275.32
myself in a more work-life setup then I

272.03 --> 278.51
can engage into digging deeper and

275.32 --> 281.39
seeing if I can find a or maybe I'm

278.51 --> 287.59999999999997
probably gonna try that before that find

281.39 --> 292.21999999999997
a a study I pay a spade work study type

287.6 --> 294.16900000000004
of thing that I can engage you with to

292.22 --> 296.97900000000004
get an actual job that actually pays

294.169 --> 299.479
decently and not totally shitty and

296.979 --> 302.24
hopefully where I will be able to end up

299.479 --> 304.07
as like a one-man force and Arden I'm

302.24 --> 307.25
not gonna be subjected any more

304.07 --> 311.65999999999997
different constant [ __ ] of the

307.25 --> 313.94
shitty shitty mainstream radio that I or

311.66 --> 315.71000000000004
refining Lee realized that I'm gonna be

313.94 --> 320.45
subjected to probably for the next two

315.71 --> 322.65999999999997
years at least so yeah looking forward

320.45 --> 325.51
to that

322.66 --> 329.26000000000005
guess I'm just gonna have to let a

325.51 --> 334.59999999999997
certain part of my brain die and leave

329.26 --> 348.58
damage in order to do this but yeah it's

334.6 --> 352.09000000000003
not like I have a choice not ready so no

348.58 --> 361.81
not really Geoffrey bail depends on on

352.09 --> 363.82
the sector we'll see it's gonna be like

361.81 --> 368.23
that it's gonna be like that then I'm

363.82 --> 373.84
just gonna suffer back in the gutter go

368.23 --> 376.03000000000003
back to that form of isolation as I can

373.84 --> 379.63
guarantee the more I do this the more

376.03 --> 382.17999999999995
angry I will be and the less capable of

379.63 --> 386.17
just normal communication to a high

382.18 --> 389.26
intellectual level as I said so yeah

386.17 --> 394.42
that's not I'll probably not recognize

389.26 --> 400.12
myself yes I do Drive I have a driver's

394.42 --> 402.46000000000004
license very good at it it's an

400.12 --> 403.93
attainable job though anything

402.46 --> 408.34
surrounding that because those are the

403.93 --> 409.90000000000003
most wanted jobs ever or you get really

408.34 --> 413.46
shitty once where you don't get paid

409.9 --> 413.46
anything so

425.589 --> 433.419
come in as in income on the panel

429.729 --> 443.549
sure gleam you like why not

433.419 --> 451.859
that'd be cool anyway they do after

443.549 --> 451.859
yesterday's angry hangout letter debates

453.09 --> 461.25
I don't remember if I actually went on

456.57 --> 463.38
Jose's I think I did yeah I did I was I

461.25 --> 468.9
was getting kind of pissed off really

463.38 --> 470.01
easily and also went on grantees really

468.9 --> 478.79999999999995
late probably shouldn't have done that

470.01 --> 483.93
because it's just yeah did the hang out

478.8 --> 489.66
said Arwen and had a meek and hmm really

483.93 --> 493.58
well it wasn't it was mostly just Brian

489.66 --> 493.58000000000004
Trish blah blah blah blah blah blah

494.33 --> 499.82
those two are in blah blah love or

497.1 --> 503.85
something it was terrible

499.82 --> 506.96999999999997
literally hurts to sit through that and

503.85 --> 509.72
when I actually got no I wasn't drunk

506.97 --> 509.72
again Lottie

513.28 --> 516.9
I was just pissed off

522.34 --> 525.4290000000001
[Music]

527.37 --> 537.6
and besides I tried to actually bring

530.95 --> 540.6400000000001
forth a good idea on the show you know

537.6 --> 544.62
trying to grab into what Trish was

540.64 --> 546.4
constantly seeing if Kira green ooze

544.62 --> 547.24
doesn't know what the hell she's talking

546.4 --> 552.12
about

547.24 --> 556.48
as I tried to convey I hope you got that

552.12 --> 558.19
but yeah then I came on to the wiki idea

556.48 --> 561.64
and that's actually a really good idea

558.19 --> 566.3800000000001
but yeah when I tried to get into that

561.64 --> 569.29
Oh Randy didn't respond goody even

566.38 --> 570.73
though he was visibly there I don't know

569.29 --> 574.3299999999999
if he heard me or anything

570.73 --> 576.61
and I thought it was a pretty good idea

574.33 --> 579.5500000000001
it's not that tough to do it just have

576.61 --> 588.64
to be able to rely on certain key people

579.55 --> 591.5999999999999
and don't let any paranoid people or

588.64 --> 593.89
like people that really want their way

591.6 --> 596.71
those people should not have the main

593.89 --> 601.18
keys as it were you've really got to

596.71 --> 603.22
have arbitrary types and then in the end

601.18 --> 606.16
it could be quite confusing and there

603.22 --> 610.96
could be with almost every subject like

606.16 --> 612.79
multiple trains of approach from certain

610.96 --> 615.4000000000001
type of individuals that insist that

612.79 --> 618.3399999999999
their specific type of form is inserted

615.4 --> 622.36
there and so then yeah you could through

618.34 --> 626.0500000000001
the wiki then see ok these are different

622.36 --> 629.83
types of opinions on this subject with

626.05 --> 633.28
different types of structuring and sub

629.83 --> 635.86
commentary on that whatever you know but

633.28 --> 639.4
it's doable and the wiki system it's

635.86 --> 641.62
pretty much prefab so you don't have to

639.4 --> 642.8199999999999
program a database or that kind of none

641.62 --> 645.82
it's not like you have to build a

642.82 --> 648.82
website from scratch for that it's just

645.82 --> 653.1400000000001
a wiki system so I thought it was a

648.82 --> 654.88
great idea and it's not like I can

653.14 --> 656.86
afford anything like that because I said

654.88 --> 658.05
yeah you need a server you need good

656.86 --> 660.509
security

658.05 --> 663.149
because just like our channels are

660.509 --> 666.3000000000001
getting shat on and attacked and

663.149 --> 669.569
whatever such a surfer will be

666.3 --> 672.809
absolutely a target the damage they

669.569 --> 674.399
could do is significant and yeah if

672.809 --> 676.86
you're not properly secured with such a

674.399 --> 681.269
server then it's just not worth the time

676.86 --> 684.48
and so and I don't have server space I

681.269 --> 687.36
don't have money so I can't do anything

684.48 --> 692.54
I can just make up ideas and then watch

687.36 --> 695.339
how I already ignores me we so or not

692.54 --> 698.2489999999999
you know don't always get ignored with

695.339 --> 701.009
my ideas and sometimes it's just the

698.249 --> 704.6890000000001
timing no other people out there

701.009 --> 709.98
actually busy like really busy

704.689 --> 712.41
not unlike me because I pretty much have

709.98 --> 714.779
at least three hours to ponder on

712.41 --> 721.649
whatever before I start the show and

714.779 --> 723.569
let's do that they don't barely a while

721.649 --> 727.439
unless they really prepare a big

723.569 --> 732.8689999999999
presentation thing most people are just

727.439 --> 736.23
too busy listen to every idea anyone

732.869 --> 738.629
brings up it's only when they're eating

736.23 --> 740.85
sadly in the time in the place to really

738.629 --> 743.1
do something that's when they're just

740.85 --> 745.519
latch on that's what everybody seems to

743.1 --> 745.519
be doing

749.06 --> 752.2399999999999
[Music]

756.68 --> 763.9699999999999
right yeah so I wasn't drunk but I did

760.519 --> 769.699
get two beers and I had them around

763.97 --> 771.0790000000001
houses because I I it wasn't even it

769.699 --> 776.059
didn't turn out that bad I was really

771.079 --> 778.1289999999999
expecting somebody to start nagging on

776.059 --> 780.199
me but I guess that I already showed my

778.129 --> 781.999
friend about is funner abilities in the

780.199 --> 783.079
show before so everybody was kind of

781.999 --> 785.779
careful and there was a bit

783.079 --> 788.899
disappointing because I was about to

785.779 --> 792.79
unleash myself but didn't really get to

788.899 --> 795.679
that just was very harsh tone but mostly

792.79 --> 799.279
but yeah that it you know when you get

795.679 --> 805.399
really pissed off sometimes especially

799.279 --> 807.769
when you feel hurt about a lot yeah if

805.399 --> 809.569
you're in them fight with somebody like

807.769 --> 810.319
if you're married or if go for any

809.569 --> 811.91
little bit yeah

810.319 --> 813.86
if you feel like that and you drink

811.91 --> 815.929
alcohol then yeah then you're totally

813.86 --> 818.3000000000001
shooting yourself in the foot or much

815.929 --> 823.85
worse you know when you do that's not

818.3 --> 826.0089999999999
good but I'm alone so all I had to do

823.85 --> 828.41
basically was not yell in the middle of

826.009 --> 831.639
the night well that did act actually

828.41 --> 834.92
happen eventually because when I told

831.639 --> 837.74
Trish to just shut up and stop rum

834.92 --> 839.899
passing me or however I said that like

837.74 --> 843.17
can't you just let me finish the damn

839.899 --> 845.149
sentence woman but I said that very loud

843.17 --> 850.639
and my roommate actually woke up for

845.149 --> 853.579
that goodie so now there's that yeah Hey

850.639 --> 856.699

954.759 --> 961.36
didn't present me so now cuz I love it

958.81 --> 963.0999999999999
just get general advice maybe if you

961.36 --> 965.17
just do this maybe if you just do that

963.1 --> 967.48
from people that I kind of have

965.17 --> 970.329
conflicted feelings with ego wise it's

967.48 --> 975.91
just brilliant how that works out love

970.329 --> 977.29
it doesn't hurt my sense of honour at

975.91 --> 980.29

977.29 --> 983.91
yeah thank you man thank you reason

980.29 --> 983.91
that's you're the best

985.249 --> 989.16

yeah I haven't seen you for a while

989.16 --> 1001.1
you've been very busy I think with your

992.91 --> 1005.449
new home so yeah you told me that over

1001.1 --> 1010.749
Chet anyway let me Oh I'm literally

1005.449 --> 1010.7489999999999
dizzy here now for a moment all right

1010.929 --> 1021.619
okay so anyway rectangular looping there

1016.279 --> 1028.699
you go rectangular looping model it's a

1021.619 --> 1034.339
model oh right made three drawings okay

1028.699 --> 1041.1490000000001
the first one is a yeah is a nine times

1034.339 --> 1043.76
grid yeah how do I explain this

1041.149 --> 1048.1689999999999
okay the middle square you see here is

1043.76 --> 1052.73
basically our known earth realm and in

1048.169 --> 1056.8990000000001
this case yet it loops at least is the

1052.73 --> 1064.1200000000001
west so right next to it is the same

1056.899 --> 1068.0189999999998
realm and they add the swirly line is I

1064.12 --> 1071.84
guess the day light night light division

1068.019 --> 1075.23
roughly I would I don't know it's it's

1071.84 --> 1078.47
kind of improvised that part but yeah in

1075.23 --> 1080.8700000000001
this model I can say yeah I drew it as

1078.47 --> 1082.549
if the North and South literally

1080.87 --> 1085.789
connected in the same way so there's

1082.549 --> 1090.3799999999999
yeah so that's why it's nine squares all

1085.789 --> 1092.09
the same realm of our realm that is if

1090.38 --> 1095.269
there is a direct loop north and south

1092.09 --> 1097.639
which is an option potentially look even

1095.269 --> 1102.49
the the book beyond the book the pole

1097.639 --> 1105.2299999999998
North Pole was it you know the poles

1102.49 --> 1107.96
basically said yeah go north you go to

1105.23 --> 1110.3890000000001
another realm in that case in that case

1107.96 --> 1112.73
this would be wrong because there would

1110.389 --> 1115.49
be another realm north and potentially

1112.73 --> 1117.34
south but it did suggest that they went

1115.49 --> 1120.58
continued north until they

1117.34 --> 1122.7099999999998
ended up back south so that is one thing

1120.58 --> 1124.51
okay now here is this I already made

1122.71 --> 1126.07
another drawing of this I could show you

1124.51 --> 1128.86
that but it's thought I want to just

1126.07 --> 1132.8799999999999
show this this is a side-on perspective

1128.86 --> 1137.02
so you're looking in from the west and

1132.88 --> 1142.8100000000002
the East is the farthest away and these

1137.02 --> 1147.6399999999999
are yeah the lines this line and that

1142.81 --> 1152.73
line that line those are the antique

1147.64 --> 1152.73
waiters and in the middle

1152.74 --> 1159.3700000000001
everything is the wrong way on this one

1155.4 --> 1161.5
that one that's the equator yeah I

1159.37 --> 1163.81
didn't take the effort to draw an entire

1161.5 --> 1167.17
freaking earth map into this it's just

1163.81 --> 1169.21
too much work and so you can see in here

1167.17 --> 1173.77
the line that story line with the

1169.21 --> 1178.27
circles that's the rough position of the

1173.77 --> 1181.54
Sun the solar maximum over the equator

1178.27 --> 1182.65
so their minimum blur I may be using the

1181.54 --> 1185.35
wrong terminology

1182.65 --> 1187.39
over the antique waiters because I'm

1185.35 --> 1190.36
assuming that's gonna be roughly the

1187.39 --> 1195.3700000000001
same and the rectangular looping model

1190.36 --> 1198.6399999999999
in a sense conceptualizes that the North

1195.37 --> 1201.3999999999999
Pole and the South Pole are experienced

1198.64 --> 1203.5
roughly the same that could be incorrect

1201.4 --> 1206.0800000000002
though it make the nature of the globe

1203.5 --> 1208.63
of the heavens much more complicated not

1206.08 --> 1212.59
so straightforward but that is currently

1208.63 --> 1220.0900000000001
my assumption so and then we go here and

1212.59 --> 1223.9599999999998
that is how yeah the sun's pathway over

1220.09 --> 1228.25
one realm section how the Sun basically

1223.96 --> 1231.64
goes up officially this is like a cross

1228.25 --> 1235.33
section of the literal side of the globe

1231.64 --> 1238.18
of the heavens how it would look and you

1235.33 --> 1239.71
see the Sun come up in the east go over

1238.18 --> 1242.74
you and go down in the West

1239.71 --> 1245.17
not exactly perfectly above you for some

1242.74 --> 1247.3
reason for Allah in our hangouts even

1245.17 --> 1250.3000000000002
explain this that at the equator itself

1247.3 --> 1251.61
the Sun is not literally going over you

1250.3 --> 1255.79
it's going

1251.61 --> 1258.1799999999998
slightly from behind you well lit it

1255.79 --> 1260.95
goes up a bit in the south then

1258.18 --> 1262.96
diagonally crosses over and in its

1260.95 --> 1264.79
height it's slightly to the north and

1262.96 --> 1266.53
then it arcs back again that's

1264.79 --> 1270.34
apparently what happens there according

1266.53 --> 1272.8899999999999
to what Paula testified to and she did

1270.34 --> 1274.75
some research so I can't directly

1272.89 --> 1277.5400000000002
explain that other than yeah that's just

1274.75 --> 1279.7
how the globe of the heavens how how the

1277.54 --> 1282.55
lights are arranged for some reason

1279.7 --> 1285.76
that's how it's designed so yeah my

1282.55 --> 1287.47
model okay the rectangular looping model

1285.76 --> 1289.45
without actually showing you the map

1287.47 --> 1294.43
because if you want to see that you're

1289.45 --> 1298.45
just gonna have to look below or rather

1294.43 --> 1301.0600000000002
right below this because that is one of

1298.45 --> 1307.96
those cross sections that's one of those

1301.06 --> 1316.3
squares that I showed you so there you

1307.96 --> 1322.27
go yeah the globe yeah a globe of the

1316.3 --> 1323.86
heavens that is where you see the Stars

1322.27 --> 1326.32
where you see the moon where you see all

1323.86 --> 1328.84
the heavenly bodies it's always at the

1326.32 --> 1332.11
edge of vision and hey since an edge of

1328.84 --> 1337.2099999999998
vision as a certain could be considered

1332.11 --> 1339.52
to have a radius always why not consider

1337.21 --> 1341.83
it as an apparent globe it's not

1339.52 --> 1345.04
literally a globe it's an apparent globe

1341.83 --> 1347.53
that is where the optical phenomena are

1345.04 --> 1351.52
positioned at the edge of vision and

1347.53 --> 1354.73
that shows itself those phenomena show

1351.52 --> 1357.61
arrange itself optically like a globe or

1354.73 --> 1361.2
like a damn my cloak to the viewer that

1357.61 --> 1361.1999999999998
is the globe of the heavens

1368.059 --> 1374.79
yeah that's correct Dave Johnson and the

1372.72 --> 1378.74
equator is straight it's a very specific

1374.79 --> 1382.4099999999999
audition the equator is a straight line

1378.74 --> 1385.83
yet there's no curvature and their

1382.41 --> 1389.01
incomes the first the most apparent and

1385.83 --> 1393.6899999999998
the shortest loop and wherever the loop

1389.01 --> 1397.11
else is is yet to be figured out as I be

1393.69 --> 1402.8700000000001
very clear about could even be upwards

1397.11 --> 1407.04
we could be yeah above us could be the

1402.87 --> 1409.34
bottom of our earth I have no idea how

1407.04 --> 1414.47
deep that would be but it could be

1409.34 --> 1414.47
according to looping space principles

1417.17 --> 1426.42
there is no dome in that model scepter

1420.63 --> 1429.1200000000001
he could be a flat top however look it

1426.42 --> 1433.89
could be even so such and I speculated

1429.12 --> 1436.7399999999998
this early on it's weird I don't see it

1433.89 --> 1441.96
as very likely but who knows it could be

1436.74 --> 1444.03
simply that in certain the realm the

1441.96 --> 1447.72
space of the realm which should be a

1444.03 --> 1449.58
confined space has elements to it so

1447.72 --> 1451.5
there would be at least two two ways

1449.58 --> 1454.309
there would be looping element East in

1451.5 --> 1457.83
the West well there could be barriers

1454.309 --> 1461.61
potentially above and maybe north and

1457.83 --> 1464.0
south this is what free energy what his

1461.61 --> 1468.08
model basically shows it's like

1464.0 --> 1473.13
literally the Train man station a tunnel

1468.08 --> 1475.35
with a loop that's exactly his mother

1473.13 --> 1477.8400000000001
and I don't necessarily fully agree with

1475.35 --> 1479.85
it's very specific you could turn out to

1477.84 --> 1482.1599999999999
be right could just be a stupid

1479.85 --> 1484.86
speculator here on nonsense and

1482.16 --> 1487.02
everybody already knows we just can't

1484.86 --> 1490.83
get our heads together to truly figure

1487.02 --> 1494.73
it out but yeah i keeping i'm keeping up

1490.83 --> 1498.4499999999998
the options keeping open the options for

1494.73 --> 1499.35
now until i get a definitive definitive

1498.45 --> 1504.13
proof

1499.35 --> 1507.61
that dispels any of those options so but

1504.13 --> 1509.98
yeah there could be a flat top that flat

1507.61 --> 1514.1799999999998
top could potentially be the bottom of

1509.98 --> 1520.77
our earth which literally be staring at

1514.18 --> 1520.77
the bottom or could be even weirder

1521.34 --> 1526.9299999999998
there could be simply while there's loop

1524.98 --> 1529.66
in certain directions and potentially

1526.93 --> 1532.45
varying in other directions there could

1529.66 --> 1535.5400000000002
also be just a layer that is kind of

1532.45 --> 1538.81
flexible and it's simply the limit to

1535.54 --> 1541.03
space in the sense that nothing can

1538.81 --> 1543.25
become go beyond it it would not be a

1541.03 --> 1547.99
physical barrier it would simply be the

1543.25 --> 1549.88
end to where material can exist and it

1547.99 --> 1551.83
would be as good as a barrier may it

1549.88 --> 1554.65
might even be somewhat flexible which

1551.83 --> 1557.3799999999999
would be very weird that's one way I've

1554.65 --> 1561.0400000000002
been visualized it just literally bets

1557.38 --> 1563.23
where the simulation and that's just

1561.04 --> 1565.83
boof yeah there's nothing beyond gas

1563.23 --> 1565.83
can't go
