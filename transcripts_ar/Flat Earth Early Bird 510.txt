5.81 --> 28.738999999999997
[Music]

31.28 --> 33.34
you

41.94 --> 44.0
you

44.04 --> 46.129999999999995
ooh

46.56 --> 51.870000000000005
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

49.29 --> 53.49
number 510 I'm your host

51.87 --> 55.44
Arwen and before we start the show

53.49 --> 57.6
please don't forget to share it on any

55.44 --> 59.339999999999996
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

57.6 --> 60.9
already subscribed to my channel and hit

59.34 --> 62.970000000000006
the bell notification so you know what

60.9 --> 64.83
I'm going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

62.97 --> 67.59
amsterdam time every day

64.83 --> 69.72
please also do support me through the

67.59 --> 74.07000000000001
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

69.72 --> 77.33
chat and the soon to be initialized

74.07 --> 81.21
membership because YouTube has

77.33 --> 84.81
apparently for ya without even

81.21 --> 88.55
announcing as far as I've noticed it's

84.81 --> 90.78
yeah initiated membership system

88.55 --> 92.82
allowances I don't know if you're

90.78 --> 95.7
probably required to be monetized for

92.82 --> 99.02999999999999
that but I noticed over at Jose said he

95.7 --> 102.42
was suddenly having members and he yeah

99.03 --> 104.67
he doesn't even have 2000 members yet so

102.42 --> 107.04
we're originally there was a very high

104.67 --> 110.78
standard to get it apparently that's now

107.04 --> 118.02000000000001
been dramatically lowered so I guess I

110.78 --> 120.63
should use that situation just to add on

118.02 --> 124.259
to the show a little so I've already

120.63 --> 125.789
thought up of several tiers and names

124.259 --> 129.84
and all that working on it

125.789 --> 132.81
Adam Meakin is helping me find some good

129.84 --> 136.83
icons you already forwarded some pretty

132.81 --> 141.49
good selection so yeah that's that's

136.83 --> 144.59900000000002
also coming anyway the weather today is

141.49 --> 144.59900000000002
[Music]

145.1 --> 155.64
amazing does it seem to be a hundred

151.56 --> 160.62
percent can feel free but barely it's

155.64 --> 164.04
just very sunny very warm like very warm

160.62 --> 165.63
this time I did go out for groceries

164.04 --> 167.97
just in my t-shirt and was perfectly

165.63 --> 172.79
fine also because there's not a lot of

167.97 --> 172.79
wind it's just beautiful

176.31 --> 192.13
all right so got green tea with me today

186.34 --> 195.81
I had a Sun warmed Illuminati curse on

192.13 --> 198.51999999999998
earlier because yeah they don't

195.81 --> 201.31
freshly-baked them anymore over it where

198.52 --> 203.11
I get him and yeah I don't have an oven

201.31 --> 204.79
that functions and I'm not gonna put

203.11 --> 207.81
them in the microwave so I thought you

204.79 --> 212.5
know what let's use the heat of the Sun

207.81 --> 215.29
so it was yeah prepackaged pretty much

212.5 --> 218.17
airtight so I just put that right there

215.29 --> 223.84
in between the curtain and the window

218.17 --> 226.17999999999998
for a while and that worked great wasn't

223.84 --> 228.69
really hot but it was warm enough so

226.18 --> 228.69
that was nice

228.99 --> 236.20000000000002
hadn't had one of those in a while yeah

233.74 --> 238.239
yeah Marco bucks it was okay it's not as

236.2 --> 240.25
good as when it's like from the oven

238.239 --> 242.38
that's a little bit more crispy and all

240.25 --> 247.69
that and the filling is a little warmer

242.38 --> 250.81
but yeah it was great ah so let's see it

247.69 --> 258.669
was in check sorry for being a little

250.81 --> 261.54
bit late to just timing and with this

258.669 --> 264.31
heat like things do slow down a bit just

261.54 --> 266.11
to get fair I get very comfortable I've

264.31 --> 267.97
been feeling pretty good I was up early

266.11 --> 275.23
because I went to bed early

267.97 --> 277.3
and yeah that worked out great been

275.23 --> 280.6
having a really nice morning anyway

277.3 --> 283.33
stone monkey 3d was first and Gary

280.6 --> 286.72
sheller is back in chat and blocked him

283.33 --> 291.13
and he won this day's the last day you

286.72 --> 293.31
can do is his thing is supposed to the

291.13 --> 295.89
experiment

293.31 --> 301.57
so yeah we'll see what comes with that

295.89 --> 307.08
errand maverick Amanda you Jim Jones

301.57 --> 307.08
acaba our bar is stuff Steve

309.629 --> 331.16900000000004
over McCool Tom Parker Marko bags cut me

321.669 --> 331.169
Cassie Gilmore flat ball like energy oh

331.379 --> 339.3
damn it I hate it when the chat just

334.74 --> 343.919
clicks all of a sudden I lose track I

339.3 --> 343.919
got questions like energy

344.97 --> 349.56
John John Mack hmm

352.539 --> 360.11
dinosaur Falcon said he doesn t know

358.1 --> 365.63
yeah I think I got everyone now let's

360.11 --> 383.139
see you all I hope you're enjoying the

365.63 --> 383.139
weather where you're at as well so yeah

385.09 --> 392.289
the evil witch rule is keeping us

387.8 --> 395.09000000000003
indoors oh well not over here as much I

392.289 --> 397.94
don't know how how bad it is at where

395.09 --> 400.729
you're at or how much of it is Bluff

397.94 --> 403.49
again no everything is about bluff at

400.729 --> 406.50899999999996
these days it seems and it's shining

403.49 --> 406.509
through more and more

406.699 --> 414.97
yeah I've been listening back to parts

409.88 --> 418.849
of my stream yesterday also just nothing

414.97 --> 423.889
it's a really weird idea

418.849 --> 426.86
concerning the eugenics I started to get

423.889 --> 430.37
my doubts about it like I was basically

426.86 --> 432.22900000000004
putting down like an image like trying

430.37 --> 434.74
to show it from another perspective and

432.229 --> 437.539
there probably is something to it but

434.74 --> 439.639
it's a little bit more complicated so I

437.539 --> 442.46
might have over simplified things a

439.639 --> 445.37
little you know it wasn't a queue for

442.46 --> 449.289
everyone to to flip around their view on

445.37 --> 451.94
the on the situation it was just a

449.289 --> 456.219
unique different angle to it that I

451.94 --> 460.909
noticed and started to build on so just

456.219 --> 463.33
needed to add that to yesterday's

460.909 --> 463.33
hangout

466.479 --> 473.71999999999997
that is sky fly Bray the piste sir not

471.889 --> 475.849
flat yeah but the geometrical

473.72 --> 480.069
orientation of the Earth's surface is

475.849 --> 480.069
flat sky fly right so

487.61 --> 493.08000000000004
all right what scared about you

490.56 --> 496.229
mentioned you were and there's some kind

493.08 --> 498.06
of attack well it seems like that at

496.229 --> 500.4
times but it comes

498.06 --> 509.19
well it's effectively coming from the

500.4 --> 511.67999999999995
inside it's just yeah I've always had

509.19 --> 516.57
that like even when I was very young I

511.68 --> 517.89
think that thing it's like a I don't

516.57 --> 521.0100000000001
know I've always thought of it like

517.89 --> 525.3
that's like a berserker rage type thing

521.01 --> 526.71
element that's apparently in my genes it

525.3 --> 529.7099999999999
slipped in somehow

526.71 --> 535.5
I don't know but ever since I was a

529.71 --> 539.7900000000001
little kid like after I really started

535.5 --> 546.45
to grow as it were and then then it kind

539.79 --> 548.79
of arrived in my early teens I don't

546.45 --> 552.87
know it first kind of appeared out of

548.79 --> 554.43
frustration of my disconnection socially

552.87 --> 557.2090000000001
with others that's really when it

554.43 --> 563.04
started to like her get angry and then

557.209 --> 567.029
yeah it's weird but it is what it is

563.04 --> 569.73
I've been offend eeling with it pretty

567.029 --> 574.73
much my entire life and it it's like a

569.73 --> 574.73
puzzle top of everything else

576.5 --> 586.079
you can realty relate right right okay

583.8 --> 589.709
so I'm not the only one I think that

586.079 --> 592.319
everybody has these elements to certain

589.709 --> 596.939
level in themselves some with some it

592.319 --> 599.459
might be so it might not be so strong so

596.939 --> 602.37
that it effectively never really shows

599.459 --> 604.17
itself like that and some have it

602.37 --> 605.67
stronger and there's all I'm pretty

604.17 --> 607.4699999999999
certain there's people out there that

605.67 --> 614.67
have this that don't have it under

607.47 --> 618.99
control at all at all because ya don't

614.67 --> 624.209
like to compare it but yeah the guy that

618.99 --> 627.8
I also talked about the the father of my

624.209 --> 632.5189999999999
friend in MF who's maniac he also has

627.8 --> 636.269
these traits except with him he's it's

632.519 --> 638.339
completely taken him like that's the

636.269 --> 641.25
only thing that's left so it seems and

638.339 --> 642.3800000000001
he is just it's very creepy it's never

641.25 --> 645.81
normal

642.38 --> 647.519
it's like he's only apparently normal in

645.81 --> 653.2399999999999
between moments and then it's just

647.519 --> 653.24
oblivious it's he is freaking insane so

653.449 --> 661.74
and yeah earlier in my life I had

659.37 --> 664.43
moments when I was just so overwhelmed

661.74 --> 670.139
by things as I was stressed out and and

664.43 --> 673.5889999999999
in fear that I well it the experience

670.139 --> 676.189
was yeah kind of similar to that it's

673.589 --> 683.12
just when you lose control of [ __ ] but I

676.189 --> 685.68
unfortunately never yeah I I didn't I

683.12 --> 689.13
didn't keep on sliding as it were I

685.68 --> 691.829
broke out because I did the weird thing

689.13 --> 696.42
was when it all happened I kind of

691.829 --> 698.3389999999999
realized and didn't forget about what

696.42 --> 702.7199999999999
was really transpiring I just couldn't

698.339 --> 706.6600000000001
handle it at that time I put it in wait

702.72 --> 709.85
but at the same time I would just go not

706.66 --> 712.879
not even aggressively but just like I

709.85 --> 715.16
would then reflect it inward because it

712.879 --> 716.509
was too dangerous to do that outward and

715.16 --> 721.31
that drove me mad

716.509 --> 724.3000000000001
it's freaky but I'm out of that I've

721.31 --> 725.81
been out of that for a long time oh

724.3 --> 728.319
thank god

725.81 --> 728.319
literally

733.559 --> 744.2189999999999
real name a picture don't hide and play

737.199 --> 747.569
inside okay oh yeah I take photos of

744.219 --> 747.5690000000001
photos okay

753.22 --> 758.2
I don't know Marco begs the only thing

756.28 --> 760.5699999999999
that I can share about it is what I

758.2 --> 762.6400000000001
experienced I don't know what ever would

760.57 --> 767.34
have happened if I had done things in

762.64 --> 770.68
another way and I don't care to find out

767.34 --> 772.4200000000001
it's just such an extreme situation you

770.68 --> 777.4799999999999
don't have the normal faculties

772.42 --> 777.4799999999999
available to you it's just

784.97 --> 791.759
yeah all I have to offer is just

788.579 --> 797.9899999999999
reflection upon the situation retrospect

791.759 --> 797.99
yeah anyway let's not get into all that

798.019 --> 810.17
too much hmm right

804.42 --> 810.17
is Gary sheller still there

811.339 --> 814.8190000000001
in chat

821.88 --> 832.27
right Marko bags well I'm glad you know

830.29 --> 836.709
what you described that is the most

832.27 --> 841.959
important things like what yeah when you

836.709 --> 845.0799999999999
look at it from a certain angle mistakes

841.959 --> 848.1099999999999
are only really mistakes when you don't

845.08 --> 852.01
learn from them and keep doing it then

848.11 --> 855.76
it's a mistake first comes to

852.01 --> 860.31
realizations a mistake then you defend

855.76 --> 862.779
against it try not to do it and then you

860.31 --> 864.3699999999999
completely get it out of your system and

862.779 --> 867.04
that takes two can take a very long time

864.37 --> 869.2
the fall backs and challenges pressures

867.04 --> 872.14
will make it tougher yeah that's just

869.2 --> 874.1800000000001
that's that's typical life you know life

872.14 --> 877.56
is all about mistakes and and the

874.18 --> 877.56
challenge in overcoming them

898.55 --> 901.2099999999999
right

904.12 --> 909.75
smell me if you want to do what Oh

914.4 --> 940.529
okay now he has to leave all of sudden

916.8 --> 942.87
alright yeah hmm Monday payday not sure

940.529 --> 947.82
there's gonna be any actual money placed

942.87 --> 949.5600000000001
into the account well was there any

947.82 --> 952.88
announcement that there wouldn't be or

949.56 --> 952.88
is it just rumors

979.71 --> 988.89
hmm okay

984.18 --> 988.89
that's new Nick Allen in my chat

1001.59 --> 1008.0500000000001
school district so your teacher you pay

1005.05 --> 1012.1899999999999
out as a teacher they told us they would

1008.05 --> 1016.02
pay us okay well look if they told you

1012.19 --> 1022.5400000000001
and they don't then they're in trouble

1016.02 --> 1025.0
right because if they wouldn't they

1022.54 --> 1027.6399999999999
should have told you so you could have

1025.0 --> 1030.76
an opportunity even though it's still

1027.64 --> 1032.8000000000002
not very pleasant and justified to have

1030.76 --> 1035.47
that situation you'd still have the

1032.8 --> 1039.22
opportunity to find another income

1035.47 --> 1042.82
source so if they said that they would

1039.22 --> 1045.459
pay then they must it's like because of

1042.82 --> 1048.1299999999999
the promise and they could get into

1045.459 --> 1054.94
legal trouble if they don't if I'm not

1048.13 --> 1057.2800000000002
mistaken see but yeah I hope things work

1054.94 --> 1062.56
out all right Missouri where they

1057.28 --> 1065.35
probably will don't worry too much right

1062.56 --> 1067.83
well you weren't worried by the way as

1065.35 --> 1067.83
you said

1072.71 --> 1077.63
be right there okay

1084.63 --> 1089.48
he and a koala see you

1094.179 --> 1099.279
all right I have as a good comment life

1096.789 --> 1101.919
seems to be easier as one grow all that

1099.279 --> 1106.57
grows older yep

1101.919 --> 1109.779
well it's not as much easier as you just

1106.57 --> 1112.029
get more grip onto everything that is

1109.779 --> 1115.749
happening but especially in the past

1112.029 --> 1118.09
it's like retroactive grip and that's

1115.749 --> 1120.999
called wisdom by the way so yeah that's

1118.09 --> 1123.73
like the ultimate advantage of growing

1120.999 --> 1127.269
older is wisdom if you don't waste your

1123.73 --> 1129.94
faculties that is that's very important

1127.269 --> 1133.779
that's also why it's extremely important

1129.94 --> 1137.6490000000001
as a parent in my opinion that you

1133.779 --> 1140.35
really push your kids to develop their

1137.649 --> 1142.7199999999998
faculties and skills and like make it a

1140.35 --> 1145.869
mission to them especially if they're

1142.72 --> 1149.3500000000001
really talented like they shouldn't let

1145.869 --> 1151.09
go of doing that then they become

1149.35 --> 1155.619
addicted to it as kids especially but

1151.09 --> 1157.539
like it's really important because of

1155.619 --> 1160.749
the focus because if you have a focus

1157.539 --> 1162.97
and you keep developing then you stay

1160.749 --> 1165.6390000000001
strong at it even at an older age and

1162.97 --> 1168.34
then as all the age catches up at the

1165.639 --> 1169.899
same time you get more grasp over the

1168.34 --> 1172.629
other things that didn't make a lot of

1169.899 --> 1177.119
sense when you were kid and then you

1172.629 --> 1182.019
learn the more it's like a retroactive

1177.119 --> 1186.519
value you get but only if you don't

1182.019 --> 1190.539
throw away your faculties if you don't

1186.519 --> 1193.35
give up on yourself and your life it's

1190.539 --> 1193.35
very important

1196.36 --> 1199.4599999999998
[Music]

1204.54 --> 1214.3999999999999
okay that's there's some troll activity

1210.42 --> 1219.8700000000001
here I'm suspecting several accounts but

1214.4 --> 1222.99
this is yeah somebody's I don't know I

1219.87 --> 1228.2099999999998
think it's like a specific person that

1222.99 --> 1234.72
just has gotten I squared on for me or

1228.21 --> 1236.93
something I don't know is I don't care

1234.72 --> 1236.93
anymore

1254.43 --> 1259.8600000000001
right you know I have it that's one of

1257.52 --> 1261.84
the things you grow older and you

1259.86 --> 1267.6899999999998
experience things you also experience

1261.84 --> 1271.01
what could turn out to be Bluff and you

1267.69 --> 1273.3600000000001
just you have basic yeah world

1271.01 --> 1276.33
experimentation data available to you

1273.36 --> 1278.6399999999999
where first you had models presented to

1276.33 --> 1281.04
you about reality and then you went with

1278.64 --> 1283.23
that and then the story fits perfectly

1281.04 --> 1285.54
right but later on you figure out that

1283.23 --> 1288.1200000000001
dinner that didn't happen and then you

1285.54 --> 1291.24
start to build your own or you don't

1288.12 --> 1293.06
think about it because Oh world has to

1291.24 --> 1296.97
be a globe or something you know but

1293.06 --> 1301.6499999999999
yeah that's the advantage you figure out

1296.97 --> 1304.77
how much Bluff is applied and also how

1301.65 --> 1308.2800000000002
easy it really is the full people that

1304.77 --> 1310.56
aren't into know it's it's kind of

1308.28 --> 1315.51
embarrassing almost but yeah it's just

1310.56 --> 1318.24
that's the way it seems to be now it's

1315.51 --> 1320.58
very arguable that that has been

1318.24 --> 1322.68
engineered into society in many

1320.58 --> 1326.49
different ways the effective dumbing

1322.68 --> 1333.03
down that certainly helps the effect but

1326.49 --> 1337.98
yeah as you grow older you don't give up

1333.03 --> 1340.29
on yourself so yeah build your faculties

1337.98 --> 1345.8
then you will figure out these details

1340.29 --> 1348.57
it's a natural consequence but you gotta

1345.8 --> 1351.69
you gotta be free you can't be full in

1348.57 --> 1355.6399999999999
fear because then yeah all those higher

1351.69 --> 1355.64
peak insights will be covered up

1364.62 --> 1371.77
this is a good servant that's fine fell

1368.77 --> 1373.02
asleep while meditating all right sounds

1371.77 --> 1375.34
delightful

1373.02 --> 1377.02
did you get an interesting dream I've

1375.34 --> 1382.1699999999998
been getting some interesting dreams

1377.02 --> 1382.17
recently it's been good

1388.24 --> 1399.04
II won one rock hunt yeah I think

1397.06 --> 1405.25
today's show is just gonna be really

1399.04 --> 1408.55
laid-back I really want more laid-back

1405.25 --> 1418.51
you know I've been quite intense recent

1408.55 --> 1423.76
few days I'm pretty sure flat ball is an

1418.51 --> 1427.23
actual person oh he wants to timeout

1423.76 --> 1437.29
someone okay well there you go don't

1427.23 --> 1440.41
don't make a habit of it please so

1437.29 --> 1443.74
anybody follow the Flat Earth debate

1440.41 --> 1446.95
yesterday I thought I was kind of on a

1443.74 --> 1454.1200000000001
roll i yeah i revealed kind of a wizard

1446.95 --> 1458.5900000000001
trick yeah I I was pretty impressed by

1454.12 --> 1460.4799999999998
myself it's I think I thought this up

1458.59 --> 1463.1799999999998
even 20 years ago and it kind of forgot

1460.48 --> 1465.3700000000001
about it and now it come what yeah it

1463.18 --> 1467.47
was brought up it's almost like I heard

1465.37 --> 1472.78
the desperate cries of baller it's like

1467.47 --> 1475.8600000000001
oh yeah how does gravity keep gas

1472.78 --> 1481.29
pressure to a ball so I was just like

1475.86 --> 1487.36
okay well I can't think of something

1481.29 --> 1491.02
there you go and that baller guy he took

1487.36 --> 1493.36
it easy reference to me and my

1491.02 --> 1496.56
explanation said that it was correct I

1493.36 --> 1502.2299999999998
thought it was awesome that was amazing

1496.56 --> 1502.23
did you hear it it's crazy

1506.76 --> 1509.8799999999999
[Music]

1514.98 --> 1525.73
okay what Tom Parker if you see somebody

1519.7 --> 1529.3
like that you can just buy them but yeah

1525.73 --> 1532.3
you know there's no problem talking if

1529.3 --> 1536.6499999999999
somebody's bored that's fine you know

1532.3 --> 1538.8999999999999
it's it's kind of lame but I'm not

1536.65 --> 1541.24
Owen Benjamin style like that like I am

1538.9 --> 1544.18
not specifically here to entertain and

1541.24 --> 1545.23
then as a comedian somebody's very bored

1544.18 --> 1547.54
yeah of course you're gonna get a

1545.23 --> 1550.57
timeout or you're gonna get banned you

1547.54 --> 1552.76
know but that's not my setup here

1550.57 --> 1556.24
somebody's bored hey I might just hand

1552.76 --> 1557.86
them something interesting but if you're

1556.24 --> 1561.46
somebody's gonna get all perverted and

1557.86 --> 1566.1
all that is just go you know what time

1561.46 --> 1566.1000000000001
it is when you see that so

1574.86 --> 1578.0
[Music]

1587.85 --> 1591.559
I know Tom Parker

1596.2 --> 1607.46
mm-hmm yeah Hannah koala school did

1604.99 --> 1612.8
didn't you have your own channel by the

1607.46 --> 1616.31
way ah these stupid YouTube system I

1612.8 --> 1638.33
can't check it I have to manually search

1616.31 --> 1644.78
for it found you right oh you have

1638.33 --> 1645.86
garden videos nice oh but kangaroo

1644.78 --> 1650.5
that's so cute

1645.86 --> 1657.31
oh damn I'm subscribing to you this is

1650.5 --> 1659.93
nice so I take it you're from Australia

1657.31 --> 1667.24
since that's the only place I know them

1659.93 --> 1667.24
where you can find kangaroos it's boring

1674.84 --> 1697.8
nothing boring about nature thank you

1690.0 --> 1702.36
over mu cool you have cats oh we have

1697.8 --> 1706.6499999999999
cats going around here as well was it

1702.36 --> 1708.3
two days ago I saved a frog from one of

1706.65 --> 1711.6000000000001
those cats that was just constantly

1708.3 --> 1716.46
[ __ ] around with it so I took like

1711.6 --> 1723.03
the the bird watcher thing and then yeah

1716.46 --> 1724.74
basically yeah my cat was right over

1723.03 --> 1727.11
there in the grass just [ __ ] around

1724.74 --> 1730.97
with the Frog and me and didn't want to

1727.11 --> 1734.34
hear that's just like yeah sorry I took

1730.97 --> 1737.82
over there went all the way over there

1734.34 --> 1743.01
on the side and then gave it a shower so

1737.82 --> 1745.74
I saved the Frog it was kind of silly

1743.01 --> 1747.99
especially because yeah retrospect I'm

1745.74 --> 1750.54
pretty certain I had a dark world vision

1747.99 --> 1755.82
memory from the perspective of that cat

1750.54 --> 1762.24
now that is a weird thing being me

1755.82 --> 1765.99
drives me nuts sometimes but yet it was

1762.24 --> 1768.78
like it was a cat that was very young

1765.99 --> 1770.73
and he's like that cat is like an

1768.78 --> 1774.99
overdose adrenaline there's something

1770.73 --> 1778.65
because he's always just getting

1774.99 --> 1783.1200000000001
territorial with other cats and I think

1778.65 --> 1785.49
probably mating with a couple and just

1783.12 --> 1789.03
like full of hormones I just had to be

1785.49 --> 1790.71
yeah just wanted him to condition him a

1789.03 --> 1793.47
little to leave something off the phone

1790.71 --> 1795.6200000000001
alone because he doesn't need it he was

1793.47 --> 1803.75
just [ __ ] around it wasn't

1795.62 --> 1805.3999999999999
doing that to eat it mmm I think it's a

1803.75 --> 1808.73
wildcat I don't think I think it's a

1805.4 --> 1810.02
wild one not sure though

1808.73 --> 1811.88
well they're still there he's still

1810.02 --> 1814.1589999999999
gonna be able to get plenty of food

1811.88 --> 1818.8090000000002
because there's so many cat people with

1814.159 --> 1821.8090000000002
cats here and plenty of food around yeah

1818.809 --> 1825.62
cats can be brutal it's true that's a

1821.809 --> 1828.9189999999999
problem like when everything is all

1825.62 --> 1834.4399999999998
hunky-dory everybody's all chill cats

1828.919 --> 1840.98
will make trouble it's true it's

1834.44 --> 1844.01
especially certain types because yeah

1840.98 --> 1846.3990000000001
cats just have a very strong defiant

1844.01 --> 1846.399
spirit

1866.29 --> 1876.67
you're more afraid of a cat that goes

1868.93 --> 1879.46
hissing than a dog really okay well it

1876.67 --> 1882.94
is it especially if you don't expect it

1879.46 --> 1886.54
because cats when hissing in a life

1882.94 --> 1889.54
they are freaky but it is like a shock

1886.54 --> 1891.24
thing so if you just see them and they

1889.54 --> 1893.8
start doing that then you're like okay

1891.24 --> 1896.2
but if you just like walk around the

1893.8 --> 1898.6499999999999
corner and suddenly like this guy jumps

1896.2 --> 1901.6000000000001
at you yeah you startle like hell

1898.65 --> 1913.27
that's and some cats like to do that on

1901.6 --> 1914.1399999999999
purpose because they're bastards now

1913.27 --> 1916.99
what I get it

1914.14 --> 1920.98
I've I've known girls that are kind of

1916.99 --> 1923.95
afraid of him in a way my ex was kind of

1920.98 --> 1926.17
afraid of cats she didn't like cats fur

1923.95 --> 1930.52
and how she was a bird girl she had a

1926.17 --> 1932.8000000000002
bird but my cat is just very nice but it

1930.52 --> 1937.75
was also taught to hunt so it was kind

1932.8 --> 1940.6299999999999
of a mixed thing and but I managed to

1937.75 --> 1942.19
get my cat to leave the bird love so

1940.63 --> 1946.65
yeah they would cat and a bird in the

1942.19 --> 1949.3
same room for years and it worked

1946.65 --> 1951.94
although sometimes yeah it is still

1949.3 --> 1954.97
cancer sometimes he would be like okay

1951.94 --> 1957.49
secretly secretly look at the very sick

1954.97 --> 1961.96
and I would be no I know that you're

1957.49 --> 1965.68
doing that but yeah at the same time she

1961.96 --> 1968.74
would be allowed to go outside and yes

1965.68 --> 1971.3200000000002
she even like she killed two birds there

1968.74 --> 1975.55
so she's a fierce she was a fierce

1971.32 --> 1978.55
hunter for being a little cat my ex

1975.55 --> 1982.75
didn't like that very much but yeah she

1978.55 --> 1986.4099999999999
knew like she was not allowed to get the

1982.75 --> 1988.36
bird in the house absolutely not she

1986.41 --> 1989.98
knew and she wouldn't really do it it's

1988.36 --> 1993.57
just that sometimes she couldn't help

1989.98 --> 1993.57
but you know and translate

1995.389 --> 2003.5
pretty remarkable right that I had a cat

1999.6 --> 2006.309
and a bird in the same house and it kind

2003.5 --> 2006.309
of worked for three years

2028.25 --> 2035.0
all right and then by the way when we

2030.87 --> 2038.01
did go away from home both of us

2035.0 --> 2040.86
typically we would separate the bird in

2038.01 --> 2042.809
a different room from the cat because

2040.86 --> 2044.52
yeah you can't leave them alone that's

2042.809 --> 2048.0299999999997
just asking for trouble

2044.52 --> 2050.49
it's yeah that's a Sylvester and Tweety

2048.03 --> 2052.76
Bird situation it's not a smart thing to

2050.49 --> 2052.7599999999998
do

2057.71 --> 2060.809
[Music]

2068.52 --> 2080.52
all right yeah I have yeah hey well some

2073.83 --> 2084.149
of the more adrenaline fed cats man cats

2080.52 --> 2088.02
can be extremely fierce and yeah they

2084.149 --> 2088.919
don't they attack bigger creatures they

2088.02 --> 2091.53
don't give a [ __ ]

2088.919 --> 2093.33
it'll just like they'll you sure their

2091.53 --> 2097.8900000000003
intimidation and just become like this

2093.33 --> 2099.7799999999997
flying cloth chainsaw thing that's their

2097.89 --> 2103.49
tactic and that scares the [ __ ] out of

2099.78 --> 2109.3390000000004
any type of creature big and small so

2103.49 --> 2109.339
I've seen that yep

2109.49 --> 2116.479
[Music]

2121.22 --> 2139.73
but you know what I mean right or like

2134.329 --> 2143.3
have you ever tried to get a cat that is

2139.73 --> 2147.41
in fear out of its place like when I had

2143.3 --> 2152.4500000000003
had to retrospect but yeah when I took

2147.41 --> 2155.0
her to the vet for some reason and she

2152.45 --> 2157.43
would be like no I don't want to go

2155.0 --> 2163.4
outside and then you try to get her and

2157.43 --> 2165.19
then it's like it's really tough it's

2163.4 --> 2167.869
really tough if they don't want to come

2165.19 --> 2173.4500000000003
because like suddenly those claws are

2167.869 --> 2178.3
just yeah it's like their nails and they

2173.45 --> 2178.2999999999997
just get stuck can't move them any more

2185.91 --> 2196.35
oh that's nasty more coloured I hated

2190.53 --> 2203.1000000000004
one kids to that that's that is so that

2196.35 --> 2211.2
is that is extremely offensive if I'd

2203.1 --> 2213.36
see kids do that I don't know I would

2211.2 --> 2215.31
give them a very stern talk it depends

2213.36 --> 2220.17
on the age you know but especially like

2215.31 --> 2223.7
if they're if they're teens oh damn you

2220.17 --> 2223.7000000000003
you're in trouble if I see you do that

2224.63 --> 2233.4
big trouble you know like get them away

2229.98 --> 2235.11
or something or just a Jewish or I don't

2233.4 --> 2237.36
know even if they're like bothering you

2235.11 --> 2240.96
you kick them to get them ooh I get that

2237.36 --> 2247.01
but don't you freaking like try to hurt

2240.96 --> 2247.01
them like damage them that's that's evil

2250.8 --> 2272.4300000000003
they're not target practice yeah yeah be

2271.17 --> 2274.89
careful with that stuff

2272.43 --> 2277.7999999999997
on a koala because catnip it has a

2274.89 --> 2282.7799999999997
highly addictive property to cats it can

2277.8 --> 2285.21
kind of make them deranged if they yeah

2282.78 --> 2286.2000000000003
if they are exposed to too much of it so

2285.21 --> 2289.64
be careful with that

2286.2 --> 2294.96
seriously can actually be dangerous for

2289.64 --> 2298.1099999999997
their health as well look into that so

2294.96 --> 2300.14
yeah don't drown them in that stuff you

2298.11 --> 2300.1400000000003
know

2313.839 --> 2319.8089999999997
all right okay well mark colored if I

2316.329 --> 2322.2090000000003
were you if you see that the ten year

2319.809 --> 2323.7690000000002
olds they're just following the example

2322.209 --> 2326.109
of the big guy right that's how that

2323.769 --> 2328.269
works a ten year old just take care of

2326.109 --> 2332.619
the older one do take care of them

2328.269 --> 2335.229
just yeah get him to stop

2332.619 --> 2337.299
make him realize you know and since

2335.229 --> 2341.1699999999996
they're at that age I don't know I don't

2337.299 --> 2343.079
know how things go over there if you're

2341.17 --> 2347.109
allowed to get a little rough maybe

2343.079 --> 2348.4
don't push it of course but get get

2347.109 --> 2351.339
through it and like you don't do that

2348.4 --> 2354.549
[ __ ] and then if you do that you'll get

2351.339 --> 2355.719
to the yeah you don't even have to be

2354.549 --> 2361.18
mean to little ones

2355.719 --> 2363.819
usually I don't know man yeah this is

2361.18 --> 2366.43
just natural guy said I'm not I'm not

2363.819 --> 2369.64
telling people to be mean to kids it's

2366.43 --> 2372.3089999999997
just that if they do like psychopathic

2369.64 --> 2373.319
behavior in groups because that is what

2372.309 --> 2377.2290000000003
that is

2373.319 --> 2378.969
muted like mutilating of animals like on

2377.229 --> 2381.729
purpose trying to wound them that's

2378.969 --> 2384.579
psychopathic behavior you have to you

2381.729 --> 2388.049
have to stop that you must

2384.579 --> 2388.049
it's your civil duty

2394.609 --> 2399.68
because if little kids are around

2397.68 --> 2403.29
situations where they get used to that

2399.68 --> 2405.06
they have to reflect back on their their

2403.29 --> 2408.05
wit code of conduct later on you've got

2405.06 --> 2412.2799999999997
to be extremely careful with that [ __ ]

2408.05 --> 2412.28
don't let kids do that

2439.81 --> 2453.85
what you think Joe Biden is it Jesuit

2445.7 --> 2453.85
really really how do you reckon that

2459.55 --> 2472.21
oh I don't know maybe he used to be but

2463.48 --> 2479.43
I don't know I just see it maybe okay if

2472.21 --> 2479.43
you say so I'm not the I don't know oh

2480.45 --> 2485.23
oh he because he went to a Jesuit

2482.77 --> 2490.14
college well I also went to a Jesuit

2485.23 --> 2493.48
school sort of so does that make me one

2490.14 --> 2497.68
you know you don't know it's F to turn

2493.48 --> 2499.45
into one you know it's just those places

2497.68 --> 2501.8199999999997
have that among them I don't know

2499.45 --> 2503.0699999999997
College wait College is like higher

2501.82 --> 2509.29
right

2503.07 --> 2511.3
no for me was middle school college

2509.29 --> 2515.71
would how does it work

2511.3 --> 2517.8100000000004
College I always get this like mixed up

2515.71 --> 2519.7
because it's like different types of

2517.81 --> 2522.61
levels things starting and everything is

2519.7 --> 2523.7799999999997
very confusing to me how that works like

2522.61 --> 2531.94
in the Netherlands there's another

2523.78 --> 2536.3100000000004
division if in how schools work colleges

2531.94 --> 2536.31
and schools two different things okay

2537.48 --> 2546.19
alright so university could be

2543.79 --> 2550.77
classified under college right because

2546.19 --> 2554.35
then it makes sense it's like the adult

2550.77 --> 2560.16
yeah when you become adult that level

2554.35 --> 2560.16
school right okay

2563.98 --> 2569.4
yes I thought so I don't know I'm bored

2569.7 --> 2578.1699999999996
he's bringing up something and yeah why

2572.47 --> 2580.8399999999997
not misery but oh my god misery bear

2578.17 --> 2587.35
you're a Jesuit it's because she went to

2580.84 --> 2591.01
a Jesuit school now apparently because

2587.35 --> 2594.0899999999997
that is how that works right think I

2591.01 --> 2596.98
don't think so

2594.09 --> 2601.71
thinks it takes a lot more to become a

2596.98 --> 2601.71
Jesuit say yeah

2619.07 --> 2628.1600000000003
yes flat ball I know yeah I think that

2622.96 --> 2632.23
yeah was it again he just wanted to time

2628.16 --> 2632.23
somebody out for no reason I don't know

2632.53 --> 2635.6490000000003
[Music]

2637.7 --> 2640.8799999999997
[Music]

2648.93 --> 2655.5
well let me inform you about just a

2652.38 --> 2659.31
weird little detail like talking about

2655.5 --> 2665.33
contrast right I went from a Rudolf

2659.31 --> 2668.87
Steiner school switch from that into a

2665.33 --> 2671.85
Jesuit school there's like a real free

2668.87 --> 2675.12
three thinking individualist based

2671.85 --> 2681.7799999999997
school but with the Jesuits stuff in

2675.12 --> 2684.48
there with with that program also yeah

2681.78 --> 2686.2200000000003
now that's an odd switch right it's

2684.48 --> 2688.5
completely different worlds

2686.22 --> 2691.1699999999996
it's completely different but it worked

2688.5 --> 2694.5
it worked great because I had to kind of

2691.17 --> 2695.73
escape that other place because it

2694.5 --> 2698.49
didn't work for me

2695.73 --> 2702.81
then I had built up too much opposition

2698.49 --> 2708.54
to everything it's too much friction for

2702.81 --> 2710.91
me I was already into computer games and

2708.54 --> 2714.15
space [ __ ] and everything and and

2710.91 --> 2715.98
thought that was real got confused when

2714.15 --> 2725.27
people told me that it wasn't real

2715.98 --> 2725.27
because right just kind of fades away

2725.45 --> 2732.5899999999997
when you're no longer there they forget

2730.2 --> 2732.5899999999997
about it

2743.51 --> 2752.84
all education systems are Smithsonian I

2746.57 --> 2757.19
don't think so that's not true the

2752.84 --> 2762.23
Rudolf Steiner system at least here

2757.19 --> 2764.86
Netherlands is not like that at all and

2762.23 --> 2767.75
they get a day get into trouble for it

2764.86 --> 2773.4700000000003
but yeah they leave it to the teachers

2767.75 --> 2776.57
it's free like they let the teachers

2773.47 --> 2781.0099999999998
make the program it's it's a very

2776.57 --> 2784.4
different system but nobody is getting

2781.01 --> 2787.3
forced to put the yet to learn about

2784.4 --> 2792.11
dinosaurs or something or to learn about

2787.3 --> 2796.34
the globe earth no they skip that no I

2792.11 --> 2801.4900000000002
learned more about was it Greek

2796.34 --> 2803.75
mythology and also Roman history and

2801.49 --> 2812.1499999999996
that those are the things I remember

2803.75 --> 2817.07
most you know also just basics painting

2812.15 --> 2822.4100000000003
and I learned knitting garden it's like

2817.07 --> 2824.54
all these old skills but it was great it

2822.41 --> 2827.42
was actually really great to do that

2824.54 --> 2828.8
and because it's so weird you know we're

2827.42 --> 2830.9900000000002
so conditioned oh this is so

2828.8 --> 2834.2000000000003
old-fashioned you think oh but the

2830.99 --> 2837.4399999999996
computers are much cooler you know I was

2834.2 --> 2839.81
like that but then I should start to do

2837.44 --> 2841.34
it you figure out that there's still

2839.81 --> 2845.33
something interesting to it it's like

2841.34 --> 2847.4
hmm if you'd never have done that then

2845.33 --> 2851.66
you wouldn't know that there is kind of

2847.4 --> 2856.13
something to it so it going through that

2851.66 --> 2858.83
school did open me up to a much like

2856.13 --> 2861.32
older way of doing things and was

2858.83 --> 2863.42
interesting it was interesting to see

2861.32 --> 2865.9300000000003
other people beside you also going

2863.42 --> 2865.9300000000003
through that

2875.61 --> 2878.739
[Music]

2885.2 --> 2892.79
yeah well mind warp that a lot about

2889.73 --> 2899.059
history yeah but that see but that

2892.79 --> 2901.46
depends because they don't have to put

2899.059 --> 2903.2900000000004
everything like if if a teacher didn't

2901.46 --> 2904.43
agree or didn't want to talk about

2903.29 --> 2907.069
certain things

2904.43 --> 2912.549
there was no you wouldn't be forced to

2907.069 --> 2912.549
do that so they could leave things out

2913.569 --> 2921.91
so we didn't get globe cosmology at all

2918.7 --> 2921.91
wasn't there

2930.86 --> 2935.78
or at least it wasn't there for very

2933.41 --> 2937.6099999999997
long it I I don't know man it's a long

2935.78 --> 2940.3900000000003
time ago I don't even remember the

2937.61 --> 2944.84
curriculum it's been over 30 years I

2940.39 --> 2947.66
don't think it was there or maybe it was

2944.84 --> 2949.94
in earlier classes because I didn't go

2947.66 --> 2954.0699999999997
into the entire screw from school from

2949.94 --> 2956.6
the start I came in a little later

2954.07 --> 2958.2200000000003
because before that I was in another

2956.6 --> 2960.2599999999998
school and I had a lot of trouble there

2958.22 --> 2964.18
and there were some really weird dubious

2960.26 --> 2967.28
things going on like creepy things I

2964.18 --> 2970.0899999999997
think that in in one of those schools

2967.28 --> 2973.09
and this is probably even a record now

2970.09 --> 2975.11
this is a long long time this is like

2973.09 --> 2977.1800000000003
over 30 years ago

2975.11 --> 2978.65
there was a school that I went I'm not

2977.18 --> 2982.58
even gonna name the name it's in another

2978.65 --> 2985.94
school and there was this teacher there

2982.58 --> 2989.84
and I think that he was probably like

2985.94 --> 2992.33
caught with with I guess a pedophile or

2989.84 --> 2994.82
something at some point because after

2992.33 --> 2998.21
that the school got closed after a

2994.82 --> 3001.54
period this was after me but there were

2998.21 --> 3004.09
already weird things like a parent there

3001.54 --> 3006.58
and it's just it was an odd situation in

3004.09 --> 3010.84
that school I don't think it was super

3006.58 --> 3014.2
dark or at least oh god I don't even

3010.84 --> 3018.58
want to think about it but that was

3014.2 --> 3020.98
before the Rudolf Steiner school in

3018.58 --> 3023.43
which that absolutely nothing like that

3020.98 --> 3023.43
happened

3026.89 --> 3032.47
because yeah it's man if a teacher in

3029.89 --> 3033.5989999999997
that school would be caught doing

3032.47 --> 3038.14
something like that

3033.599 --> 3040.779
woohoo you'd be trouble man because did

3038.14 --> 3043.299
yeah many people there they don't take

3040.779 --> 3053.92
[ __ ] they're not a bunch of weak

3043.299 --> 3056.43
liberals you know so at least they they

3053.92 --> 3059.14
used to not be as far as I can remember

3056.43 --> 3063.299
used to be like sensitive but not weak

3059.14 --> 3063.299
you know and I like that about them ooh

3068.13 --> 3073.48
yeah right more color yeah glad

3071.22 --> 3075.609
laterade yeah you wanted to make Tamera

3073.48 --> 3078.46
coffee I gave give you sort of a recipe

3075.609 --> 3081.339
did you like it did you like what came

3078.46 --> 3083.26
out of it you know you can kind of

3081.339 --> 3088.68
change the combinations a little if you

3083.26 --> 3092.4300000000003
like as I said but I really appreciate

3088.68 --> 3092.43
Tamera coffee like that

3098.359 --> 3105.7799999999997
yes more colored I have but that that's

3102.63 --> 3108.4100000000003
a long time ago of course they've been

3105.78 --> 3108.4100000000003
around for a while

3130.66 --> 3133.259
right

3136.43 --> 3143.5589999999997
hmm and yeah more colored important

3140.119 --> 3149.0
question how did it feel how did it feel

3143.559 --> 3151.2200000000003
because for me when I drink coffee is

3149.0 --> 3154.099
extremely different than when I drink

3151.22 --> 3156.109
America it's it's a completely different

3154.099 --> 3159.829
experience for me cuz when I drink

3156.109 --> 3163.609
coffee it kind of like gets me a little

3159.829 --> 3165.289
tenser but for my body I don't really

3163.609 --> 3169.069
like it but when I take it with tumeric

3165.289 --> 3172.2200000000003
it's I don't have that it doesn't pants

3169.069 --> 3176.93
me up so much it just wakes me up and

3172.22 --> 3179.029
actually I don't know it's better I like

3176.93 --> 3182.68
it a lot more I'm never taking normal

3179.029 --> 3182.68
coffee again if I have the choice

3192.41 --> 3203.2
what I'm one the comet atlas I don't

3201.47 --> 3208.779
know

3203.2 --> 3212.839
it's called CV 19 it's just disgusting

3208.779 --> 3215.269
yeah they're all just I don't know man

3212.839 --> 3217.009
they're I don't know what the hell

3215.269 --> 3220.7299999999996
they're doing they're just trying to get

3217.009 --> 3222.68
synchronicity overkill everything maybe

3220.73 --> 3224.68
they're trying to break the system

3222.68 --> 3227.93
through synchronicities I don't know

3224.68 --> 3233.019
it's I don't know man I don't know why

3227.93 --> 3237.279
they do that I don't know why they do it

3233.019 --> 3237.279
but it's just annoying

3238.029 --> 3246.819
it's like ugly I don't know why they do

3244.4 --> 3246.819
it like that

3254.22 --> 3259.8999999999996
yeah mind-warped [ __ ] not there is

3257.8 --> 3267.4300000000003
no impact okay

3259.9 --> 3272.02
there is no impact what impact what of

3267.43 --> 3274.96
the next meteor or a thingamajig that's

3272.02 --> 3276.67
supposedly going past the earth this

3274.96 --> 3283.7200000000003
month or something you know there's no

3276.67 --> 3289.12
there is no thing crashing on earth at

3283.72 --> 3292.48
least no natural thing maybe a man-made

3289.12 --> 3296.46
thing I don't know but how big is that

3292.48 --> 3296.46
gonna be not very big

3319.82 --> 3330.61
oh you think Mindwarp you think are they

3327.56 --> 3336.08
trying to drip feed them you think so

3330.61 --> 3339.77
duh it's a desperate attempt to grab

3336.08 --> 3343.39
some attention look they may be I don't

3339.77 --> 3347.0
know if there's any kind of reliable

3343.39 --> 3353.69
reliability to so what they do at this

3347.0 --> 3355.91
point but maybe maybe the Vatican the

3353.69 --> 3359.51
Catholic Church is kind of like taking

3355.91 --> 3361.73
away some of the things that they that

3359.51 --> 3364.1600000000003
they erased for political reasons in the

3361.73 --> 3365.62
past so who knows maybe that did

3364.16 --> 3370.93
actually happen

3365.62 --> 3370.93
it's just does it matter

3372.88 --> 3376.06
you know

3379.85 --> 3386.33
it seems so off well mind-warped if you

3384.44 --> 3388.2200000000003
just think about everything that's

3386.33 --> 3390.02
happened in the last five years and

3388.22 --> 3393.3199999999997
realization wise things has happened

3390.02 --> 3397.73
things we discovered everything has

3393.32 --> 3402.32
always been extremely off we just didn't

3397.73 --> 3406.4
know it so if you think see a think

3402.32 --> 3409.07
seems to reoffer recently then that's

3406.4 --> 3413.83
only because you now have eyes to see

3409.07 --> 3413.8300000000004
that in it's always been extremely off

3417.55 --> 3427.09
the whole thing is like weird

3423.28 --> 3427.09
control in a weird way

3433.99 --> 3438.7189999999996
[Music]

3446.23 --> 3453.369
it's speeding up well who knows maybe it

3449.859 --> 3455.38
is as I said thinks there is an

3453.369 --> 3459.33
awakening and the awakening has a

3455.38 --> 3461.9500000000003
quickening also as result is natural

3459.33 --> 3465.88
it's natural that had happened so yeah

3461.95 --> 3468.3399999999997
as I said attention in the awakening

3465.88 --> 3470.17
attention is extremely important because

3468.34 --> 3472.21
if you can grab somebody's attention

3470.17 --> 3474.34
then you can insert all kinds of

3472.21 --> 3476.26
high-level information and they'd

3474.34 --> 3479.2000000000003
probably be able to take it a little bit

3476.26 --> 3481.78
better because of the conditions so any

3479.2 --> 3484.18
dark agency out there will be more

3481.78 --> 3487.42
desperate than ever to grab your

3484.18 --> 3489.22
attention to prevent you from wandering

3487.42 --> 3493.69
off the people that can actually hand

3489.22 --> 3497.98
you really awakened information open up

3493.69 --> 3501.43
some locks so yeah they'll do whatever

3497.98 --> 3506.14
they can think of to get some attention

3501.43 --> 3508.2999999999997
away from from awakened people that are

3506.14 --> 3510.25
really awakened and not just calling

3508.3 --> 3512.1400000000003
themselves awakened or have a giant

3510.25 --> 3520.78
billboard saying awaken their that

3512.14 --> 3524.52
nonsense no awakening is apparent you

3520.78 --> 3527.5600000000004
you feel it it does something to you

3524.52 --> 3531.0
it's not about just having a stamp or a

3527.56 --> 3536.7999999999997
word called awaken now it's an effect

3531.0 --> 3539.38
it's an energy it has yeah cannot really

3536.8 --> 3541.63
not be mistaken although you can be

3539.38 --> 3545.2000000000003
fooled into thinking something is really

3541.63 --> 3546.4300000000003
awakened but yeah what you only really

3545.2 --> 3548.3799999999997
know when you start to reflect upon

3546.43 --> 3550.18
everybody else because then you can

3548.38 --> 3551.92
figure out if it is really awakened or

3550.18 --> 3555.94
if it's actually kind of superficial is

3551.92 --> 3558.25
still very tricked you know some people

3555.94 --> 3561.55
used to think that if you knew about me

3558.25 --> 3563.26
bru coming that you were extremely

3561.55 --> 3563.77
awakened because you knew all these

3563.26 --> 3569.44
weird

3563.77 --> 3573.79
ethereal secrets right right right like

3569.44 --> 3577.66
10 years ago 20 years ago well now with

3573.79 --> 3579.74
Flat Earth we know like oh right

3577.66 --> 3587.74
certainly that's not that I

3579.74 --> 3593.2099999999996
anymore see so yeah

3587.74 --> 3596.74
agencies speaking points channels bigger

3593.21 --> 3599.48
channels that have interests programs

3596.74 --> 3602.7799999999997
specific nature will do whatever they

3599.48 --> 3608.119
can to grab people's attention to make

3602.78 --> 3609.8900000000003
them forget others especially if they're

3608.119 --> 3613.04
very awakened and if they can then

3609.89 --> 3615.41
they'll take any word they say any

3613.04 --> 3619.369
meaning they bring forth and try to

3615.41 --> 3621.5899999999997
reverse it in some way copy-paste it to

3619.369 --> 3623.63
replace it to make it seem like what

3621.59 --> 3626.54
they're talking about is the original

3623.63 --> 3629.05
and then taking away the more subtle

3626.54 --> 3633.619
lessons that were originally hidden in

3629.05 --> 3636.369
what was said it's very evil system but

3633.619 --> 3640.55
yeah that's people that have no senses

3636.369 --> 3642.98
to even know the difference they will

3640.55 --> 3645.6090000000004
just do that systematically because it

3642.98 --> 3649.79
is effective it means it makes money

3645.609 --> 3653.5299999999997
gives stats so it's very a robotic

3649.79 --> 3653.5299999999997
response that that happens

3673.46 --> 3677.7400000000002
okay that's enough now Marco bags

3681.99 --> 3691.6499999999996
yeah it was always there it's just more

3693.3 --> 3700.23
I do I'm listening to music from 10

3696.87 --> 3703.52

3700.23 --> 3709.37

3757.5 --> 3762.87
placements and all the tricks cuz they

3759.84 --> 3764.7000000000003
love it yeah everybody loves some kind

3762.87 --> 3766.58
of music and it's very rare that people
