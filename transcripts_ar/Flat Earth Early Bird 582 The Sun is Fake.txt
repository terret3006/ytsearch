the weather today is again different

80.63 --> 89.28
there's patches of clear sky it cleared

83.7 --> 91.14
up a lot yesterday evening I don't know

89.28 --> 95.399
it seems to be a lot less moist all of a

91.14 --> 100.009
sudden and it is you know kind of warm

95.399 --> 103.7
but still yeah with the continuous wind

100.009 --> 107.82
there's no Sun it is kind of fresh so

103.7 --> 114.299
but yeah it's good to have one of those

107.82 --> 116.42999999999999
days sometimes as well alright I know

114.299 --> 121.649
it's early I just didn't want to wait

116.43 --> 124.56
any longer I felt like okay I'm just

121.649 --> 126.68900000000001
gonna be waiting for 10 minutes well I

124.56 --> 131.37
just really want to get going so I just

126.689 --> 135.45
started early to make up for all the few

131.37 --> 140.6
minutes that I get late last week so

135.45 --> 145.60899999999998
anyway I got some Tamera coffee with me

140.6 --> 145.60899999999998
and some green tea as usual mmm

148.26 --> 160.38
thirsty now right so we're gonna get

155.44 --> 160.38
into check and a gem was first for sure

161.82 --> 169.66
right early bird catches the worm yeah I

166.17 --> 175.58999999999997
I'm gonna get a GM and good servant over

169.66 --> 179.23
Skype on the show somewhere in the next

175.59 --> 182.76
few minutes because I was originally

179.23 --> 186.76
gonna do a show with them yesterday

182.76 --> 189.19
after ball-busters but then like right

186.76 --> 192.1
in the last half-hour of ball busters I

189.19 --> 196.02
got called up by my friend from name--a

192.1 --> 198.64
who had another just another story like

196.02 --> 199.99
and she literally says like yeah I got

198.64 --> 204.7
another one for the books

199.99 --> 206.62
so but like she really needed to like

204.7 --> 211.23899999999998
let off some steam of like how

206.62 --> 213.55
incredibly antisocial some people are so

211.239 --> 216.73000000000002
I just really needed to spend my time on

213.55 --> 219.94
that and that took like two and a half

216.73 --> 222.01
hours that's its but yeah I take that

219.94 --> 227.23
very seriously because I'm like the only

222.01 --> 230.07999999999998
one that's even capable of getting like

227.23 --> 236.23
what what the real issue is because yeah

230.08 --> 238.9
she's a pretty condensed person and yeah

236.23 --> 241.959
I don't know very now currently I guess

238.9 --> 245.11
my best long-standing friend that has

241.959 --> 249.91
actually gone into pretty much every

245.11 --> 251.769
direction lor wise including Flat Earth

249.91 --> 252.85
by way because she does believe in Flat

251.769 --> 259.81
Earth absolutely

252.85 --> 262.69
so yeah a long friend and I'm always

259.81 --> 264.55
I'll always stand ready for like even if

262.69 --> 266.979
it's in the middle of the night like at

264.55 --> 269.14
least with my attention in my words you

266.979 --> 271.71999999999997
know because she knows like yeah at the

269.14 --> 273.49
same time I'm technically could be

271.72 --> 275.53000000000003
categorized under the cheapskate

273.49 --> 277.27
although I don't push it too much you

275.53 --> 277.86999999999995
know I'm not trying to always do that

277.27 --> 285.54999999999995
[ __ ]

277.87 --> 289.889
it's very annoying yeah but yeah so yeah

285.55 --> 292.12
we got a balance relation came to it and

289.889 --> 296.38
so let's just do it

292.12 --> 300.22
on this Sunday show I thought and both

296.38 --> 303.81
of you are already here alright so

300.22 --> 307.69000000000005
anyway a gym was first Robin Mitchell

303.81 --> 314.97
makes another very specific prediction

307.69 --> 322.0
for tomorrow we'll see the rights DANC

314.97 --> 326.41
John nine to five good servant William

322.0 --> 332.139
be Co Mandy you would see you you're

326.41 --> 338.699
early to or you had a very late night I

332.139 --> 338.699
don't know Steve

339.449 --> 347.74
Peter Harrington Missouri bear good to

345.52 --> 351.43
see you what's Missouri Bear do you read

347.74 --> 356.44
books anymore I've never really read

351.43 --> 360.19
books to be honest like I tried a lot

356.44 --> 364.5
and then I just my problem is that

360.19 --> 368.08
especially if it's like a very like

364.5 --> 370.93
fantastic if if it's a very condensed

368.08 --> 374.08
rich book I my mind wandered off I even

370.93 --> 376.72
have this reading the Bible it's like

374.08 --> 379.62
I'm just not a very good reader I'm a

376.72 --> 379.62
much better listener

385.1 --> 392.12
but I did manage to read the entire Lord

388.17 --> 393.84000000000003
of the Rings book a pretty big version

392.12 --> 397.77
completely from beginning to end

393.84 --> 402.77
voluntarily that was when I was 21 did

397.77 --> 406.28999999999996
that while sitting on the beach Spain

402.77 --> 408.15
and that's like the only real big book

406.29 --> 411.87
series that I've actually managed to

408.15 --> 418.02
read through because I'm just not that

411.87 --> 421.02
good at it I like short text pieces like

418.02 --> 423.93
when news articles and all that and some

421.02 --> 426.53999999999996
media and internet became a thing that

423.93 --> 429.27
quickly appealed to me a lot better

426.54 --> 433.56
because they're just not entire freakin

429.27 --> 436.38
books every time so yeah and it's kind

433.56 --> 440.52
of odd because my entire family are book

436.38 --> 445.83
readers like oh my dad I guess slightly

440.52 --> 449.21999999999997
less but he still does my mother and my

445.83 --> 451.8
brother were like perfect book readers a

449.22 --> 453.6
lot we had our own library but I just

451.8 --> 457.11
I'm not that guy

453.6 --> 460.07000000000005
I was kind of embarrassed back then but

457.11 --> 464.40000000000003
it's just not for me anyway

460.07 --> 467.34
I'm an audio guy like Owen right I'm off

464.4 --> 469.85999999999996
the verbal tradition I guess the bard

467.34 --> 473.71999999999997
equate appeals to me better and I'm also

469.86 --> 477.2
a much better learner in a specific

473.72 --> 479.82000000000005
student-teacher relationship either way

477.2 --> 482.52
one-on-one communication I get I pick up

479.82 --> 486.05
so much more and I can communicate so

482.52 --> 489.39
much more that way that I've ever had

486.05 --> 491.49
reading things because especially if

489.39 --> 492.75
it's like technical in reading I'm

491.49 --> 494.1
always going to be like but I have

492.75 --> 495.75
question about it why question about

494.1 --> 497.97
that question about this and then just

495.75 --> 501.12
becomes a convoluted mess well if

497.97 --> 502.95000000000005
there's a teacher then it can actually

501.12 --> 504.78000000000003
ask the questions and like try to

502.95 --> 506.729
resolve them as quickly as possible or

504.78 --> 509.7
at least be able to categorize them in

506.729 --> 511.46999999999997
probably tears that I will then deal

509.7 --> 513.93
with later while if I'm just there it's

511.47 --> 519.2
just going to be endless amounts of

513.93 --> 519.1999999999999
questions about everything right

523.91 --> 531.8
in that sense I wish when I was younger

528.38 --> 533.11
that I knew somebody like me on the

531.8 --> 538.3299999999999
Internet

533.11 --> 540.65
that's kind of silly typical I guess

538.33 --> 543.3100000000001
somebody that I could just approach and

540.65 --> 547.25
like really ask they're really like

543.31 --> 550.0699999999999
unusually complex questions and now we

547.25 --> 553.52
had not about the heliocentric math or

550.07 --> 557.24
anything but about just the structures

553.52 --> 561.4
that we deal with and even like complex

557.24 --> 561.4
situations and on it anyway right

565.39 --> 573.9499999999999
Glover's can explain Eclipse as well

568.61 --> 577.45
neither can we really it's just very

573.95 --> 577.45
bizarre light phenomena

590.14 --> 598.6899999999999
end-of-the-world film coming soon

592.76 --> 598.6899999999999
Greenland what are you talking about

599.77 --> 604.66
hey John Bernards anyway

612.4 --> 621.81
right I if a gem and good sermon are

616.69 --> 621.8100000000001
still there I'll call them up

632.41 --> 654.61
the good servants is set to away two off

637.15 --> 655.09
lines I don't know we'll see what's up

654.61 --> 658.69
Lauren

655.09 --> 661.8000000000001
Hey hello Stephen how you doing my

658.69 --> 661.8000000000001
brother what's up everybody

664.9 --> 669.87
yeah I'm gonna add in me adding him now

670.2 --> 684.37
it's another beautiful Sunday Sunday

672.94 --> 691.1800000000001
with the servant and what are you doing

684.37 --> 698.92
opening boxes suit yeah you can see me

691.18 --> 701.3499999999999
no I could hear you I have a stomach

698.92 --> 706.27
problem so I eat these tums or whatever

701.35 --> 708.37
and so I'm like running out of tones and

706.27 --> 711.51
it's at the very bottom where I'm

708.37 --> 713.65
shaking it you know companies in there

711.51 --> 715.5699999999999
you know what stomach thing I've been

713.65 --> 719.38
doing yeah right we talked about that

715.57 --> 721.3900000000001
yesterday so you kind of like sprang

719.38 --> 725.83
that on me because it seems to be quite

721.39 --> 728.05
progressed an issue so well it's it's

725.83 --> 730.48
been going on like I don't know more

728.05 --> 734.1099999999999
than six months maybe like a long time

730.48 --> 735.73
like I just I don't really normally talk

734.11 --> 737.32
about I guess I talked to Tom a little

735.73 --> 741.69
bit about it but not really I don't

737.32 --> 744.5100000000001
really mention it to anybody okay

741.69 --> 747.7600000000001
well six months is quite a long problem

744.51 --> 749.9399999999999
quite a long time to keep I like it

747.76 --> 752.68
continued it's the compounding problem

749.94 --> 755.71
to yourself you don't go there brother a

752.68 --> 760.9899999999999
lot of alternative medical people out

755.71 --> 764.2900000000001
here in this Eden to you first

760.99 --> 765.4
well just other people you know why did

764.29 --> 767.7099999999999
you keep that a secret

765.4 --> 771.4499999999999
so long this is this is no I didn't

767.71 --> 774.85
territory well I didn't think about like

771.45 --> 776.1400000000001
like I forgot about when because you had

774.85 --> 778.48
mentioned something about German new

776.14 --> 780.97
medicine or like a few months back and

778.48 --> 784.1800000000001
like I did want to look into that and

780.97 --> 785.89
and that completely slipped my mind when

784.18 --> 788.14
I was dealing with it you know dealing

785.89 --> 789.76
with this that to even connect the to

788.14 --> 792.04
that oh maybe I should ask if there's

789.76 --> 793.99
some kind of remedy or whatever for that

792.04 --> 797.02
you know right okay well the German new

793.99 --> 799.84
medicine technically does is a chart it

797.02 --> 802.6
right it doesn't give you a remedy it

799.84 --> 804.52
just kind of helps you to explain or to

802.6 --> 805.09
figure out what's going on why is it

804.52 --> 807.55
there

805.09 --> 810.5500000000001
you know and look at those rip

807.55 --> 812.3199999999999
spiritually as to give it a place so

810.55 --> 814.51
that you don't panic like oh it's going

812.32 --> 816.97
out of control you know because that is

814.51 --> 819.0699999999999
typically what a lot of people get when

816.97 --> 820.72
a compounding problem arrives and then

819.07 --> 823.2700000000001
they just think oh my god I'm gonna die

820.72 --> 825.22
or something and then they go for

823.27 --> 829.6899999999999
extreme measures and all that and that's

825.22 --> 832.24
where a lot goes wrong so well like I

829.69 --> 833.5300000000001
was on track to get like to be you know

832.24 --> 835.99
not to make this all about this thing

833.53 --> 838.2099999999999
but like like I was on track to get like

835.99 --> 841.02
you know a couple of more tests done and

838.21 --> 843.97
then possibly some surgery you know but

841.02 --> 845.9499999999999
you know maybe this Kobe thing happened

843.97 --> 847.8100000000001
at the right time in it like halted all

845.95 --> 849.61
that process and so there's a lot of red

847.81 --> 852.76
tape to even get that process started

849.61 --> 855.16
again wait so I'm just basically yeah

852.76 --> 858.43
yeah because like they're thinking cuz

855.16 --> 859.9
it's not like typical like heartburn or

858.43 --> 863.17
whatever because they have given me like

859.9 --> 866.4399999999999
really like really strong heartburn

863.17 --> 868.7199999999999
medications and it it's not that and it

866.44 --> 871.09
doesn't go up my chest it's like it's

868.72 --> 873.1
like but when I eat tums it goes away

871.09 --> 875.8000000000001
and the symptoms go away at least in the

873.1 --> 877.99
pain but like but like it's it's pain

875.8 --> 881.0799999999999
that radiates up my back you know and

877.99 --> 885.63
but from my stomach it's it's kind of a

881.08 --> 887.95
weird right weird deal then yeah okay

885.63 --> 895.45
so I'm gonna try that thing you told me

887.95 --> 897.97
about right vinegar it's a very big look

895.45 --> 899.649
you're already a pretty progress stages

897.97 --> 901.6
so I wouldn't be

899.649 --> 905.41
very care just started start out very

901.6 --> 907.389
diluted to just see like how it responds

905.41 --> 909.43
like when I tried that stuff the first

907.389 --> 910.9590000000001
few times in the morning with like I

909.43 --> 915.16
tried it basically against morning

910.959 --> 917.8889999999999
sickness which I did have you know like

915.16 --> 919.509
I even have it like backlashes from that

917.889 --> 921.73
but it seems to be coming more in the

919.509 --> 922.9590000000001
afternoon now it's weird but I tried

921.73 --> 926.23
apple vinegar and they're like you re

922.959 --> 927.8789999999999
really soothed it all up quickly and

926.23 --> 929.7090000000001
it's like weird because when yourself

927.879 --> 932.529
it's like really sour and you think like

929.709 --> 935.17
but that's the problems they do you take

932.529 --> 937.72
it and then it does the opposite it's

935.17 --> 940.319
amazing right yeah when you first said

937.72 --> 943.749
it it sounded painful to me you know

940.319 --> 945.809
it's not already like too bad if you're

943.749 --> 949.899
like completely burning up with sour

945.809 --> 953.35
then it's it's not like a direct

949.899 --> 957.04
solution to the to the symptom it's more

953.35 --> 961.3000000000001
like in between no that it just doesn't

957.04 --> 963.55
start up kind of thing that's true so if

961.3 --> 966.399
it's already really really bad yeah then

963.55 --> 968.529
I don't know what it will do I mean I'm

966.399 --> 971.709
like I'm still like I'm seeing my doctor

968.529 --> 973.329
and I see somebody you know either once

971.709 --> 975.55
a week or every other week you know at

973.329 --> 977.41
least to get like the symptoms down so I

975.55 --> 979.3599999999999
mean I'm in contact with the doctor so

977.41 --> 982.809
if I try something and it doesn't work I

979.36 --> 985.2090000000001
can always go and you know be seen by

982.809 --> 987.129
somebody but they are giving me a lot of

985.209 --> 989.3499999999999
medication that's just killing me man

987.129 --> 991.749
well that I think that that may be part

989.35 --> 993.7900000000001
of the problem there is that that's like

991.749 --> 996.009
that's part of the thing with German new

993.79 --> 999.639
medicine it's like basically telling you

996.009 --> 1002.04
like don't don't just pull in everything

999.639 --> 1004.29
they give you because you want to stop

1002.04 --> 1006.269
the problem because then there's things

1004.29 --> 1008.91
may do something and then the short run

1006.269 --> 1013.009
but even you combine it and it starts

1008.91 --> 1016.529
planting of their effects that pop up in

1013.009 --> 1018.24
later on stages you know that's

1016.529 --> 1020.249
typically what happens with with like

1018.24 --> 1023.309
real chemical pharmaceutical and all

1020.249 --> 1026.039
that that my mother basically died

1023.309 --> 1027.99
because of that effect because she just

1026.039 --> 1031.47
kept taking more and more and then it

1027.99 --> 1033.319
just destroyed it I think that's what

1031.47 --> 1036.299
I'm going through because I

1033.319 --> 1039.12
stop it well no one know when like when

1036.299 --> 1042.799
I gotten out of the army like I had to

1039.12 --> 1045.539
start taking like ants like anti - anti

1042.799 --> 1049.74
psychosis medicine and stuff like that

1045.539 --> 1051.72
and so like like like it wasn't till

1049.74 --> 1053.639
like my mid-20s I experienced any kind

1051.72 --> 1056.19
of like mental illness turning like that

1053.639 --> 1059.4599999999998
so it's kinda came on late in my life

1056.19 --> 1061.289
you know and so like just dealing with

1059.46 --> 1063.809
this kind of like dealing with that and

1061.289 --> 1066.299
taking meds for so long it's probably

1063.809 --> 1068.82
those meds over all these years it's

1066.299 --> 1072.059
probably you know eroded something in

1068.82 --> 1075.84
there my liver probably psychosis

1072.059 --> 1079.08
medicine you mean yeah that's yeah that

1075.84 --> 1081.779
is some very harsh [ __ ] man like I know

1079.08 --> 1085.559
it was offered to me too when I was like

1081.779 --> 1088.97
younger and I was like no no no way I'll

1085.559 --> 1092.82
just sit through my nightmares

1088.97 --> 1095.779
for a few years then like have like the

1092.82 --> 1099.629
the effects of that stuff because I just

1095.779 --> 1102.059
was very white but like I knew like if I

1099.629 --> 1105.389
change that [ __ ] I'll be changed forever

1102.059 --> 1108.1789999999999
and like everything that I cherish it's

1105.389 --> 1111.59
just gonna be it's gonna be different

1108.179 --> 1114.71
like I don't want to switch a person I

1111.59 --> 1118.019
just I'm just a little different

1114.71 --> 1119.49
definitely different Arwen right I'm not

1118.019 --> 1123.059
trying to shame you man you've been

1119.49 --> 1126.679
going through a log name oh oh no it is

1123.059 --> 1129.33
what I hear somebody like you

1126.679 --> 1132.8090000000002
technically going through the problems

1129.33 --> 1135.6899999999998
that I adamantly try to avoid at all

1132.809 --> 1139.98
cost and I've seen my mother be parish

1135.69 --> 1141.6000000000001
on that yeah like my dad kind of went

1139.98 --> 1144.57
the same way you know it taken a lot of

1141.6 --> 1147.539
meds you know he was I don't even think

1144.57 --> 1149.58
he was 60 when he died you know right

1147.539 --> 1151.769
you still he was still kind of a young

1149.58 --> 1153.389
man but no I mean though I'm happy with

1151.769 --> 1154.74
my life I mean everything's good I mean

1153.389 --> 1156.9289999999999
it's better me than some eight-year-old

1154.74 --> 1159.36
kid getting sick or something I feel

1156.929 --> 1161.49
happy you know my kids are good and

1159.36 --> 1163.61
right I'll get it straightened out Arwen

1161.49 --> 1166.75
I'm gonna just left for the next life

1163.61 --> 1170.86
right that's right but still yeah

1166.75 --> 1173.44
about it remember how can children

1170.86 --> 1175.87
takeover habits well you told me your

1173.44 --> 1179.26
dad was doing that it seems like you're

1175.87 --> 1183.9399999999998
doing it so you got to realize if you

1179.26 --> 1186.7
just basically keep let it be let it

1183.94 --> 1188.26
grow like that then yeah you might be

1186.7 --> 1192.46
satisfied with that but you're gonna

1188.26 --> 1194.23
continue it the example generation

1192.46 --> 1197.29
potentially you got to be careful with

1194.23 --> 1201.28
what you're doing you know what scares

1197.29 --> 1203.02
me more Arwen by living another 50 years

1201.28 --> 1206.59
that's what scares the hell out of me

1203.02 --> 1208.3
man about the lives 50 more years

1206.59 --> 1211.1999999999998
there's something in this world the way

1208.3 --> 1213.55
that's how it's crazy

1211.2 --> 1214.57
no but I am I'm gonna get everything

1213.55 --> 1218.05
straightened out

1214.57 --> 1220.51
I think this Coby thing hitting in my my

1218.05 --> 1222.37
medical stuff stopping is like put me on

1220.51 --> 1227.11
a new path to find a different way

1222.37 --> 1229.9599999999998
figure it out right yeah well yeah by

1227.11 --> 1233.1699999999998
the way I don't know is is a gem in here

1229.96 --> 1235.51
too hard yeah it was in there I thought

1233.17 --> 1239.0500000000002
he was in there I saw did um are you

1235.51 --> 1244.45
there come on brother

1239.05 --> 1245.98
you know in here is Tommy there I don't

1244.45 --> 1248.5
want to call him out though I don't

1245.98 --> 1254.56
think he is in there I did call him up I

1248.5 --> 1257.86
didn't add I don't know get on here he

1254.56 --> 1261.25
was there 20 minutes ago yes he was

1257.86 --> 1263.32
I've seen him in there ah anyway maybe

1261.25 --> 1267.4
you'll get in later you know it's Sunday

1263.32 --> 1271.3
we got plenty of time a time you want to

1267.4 --> 1278.3700000000001
come on do it do it Tom Stephen Austin

1271.3 --> 1281.71
episode what that's he telling there now

1278.37 --> 1290.08
ok well that's for me to ask technically

1281.71 --> 1293.65
since it oh yeah it so um so what's

1290.08 --> 1295.54
going on with all this other anyway I

1293.65 --> 1298.0300000000002
don't wanna bring that up mmm

1295.54 --> 1298.8999999999999
I was gonna bring up the thing that

1298.03 --> 1300.48
happened yesterday

1298.9 --> 1302.92
oh right is it

1300.48 --> 1305.14
you know didn't work - I forgot most

1302.92 --> 1307.93
forgot to address that yeah yeah no it's

1305.14 --> 1309.94
just a silly little thing really oh it

1307.93 --> 1311.68
was silly I just I went over there and I

1309.94 --> 1314.2
just said hey look man nobody's perfect

1311.68 --> 1314.77
not even me man I'm you know nobody's

1314.2 --> 1317.4
perfect

1314.77 --> 1320.2
wait what we're talking about Jose right

1317.4 --> 1322.8100000000002
yeah yeah okay bye do I have to shout

1320.2 --> 1326.02
out the super chat from Amanda yo $5 my

1322.81 --> 1326.77
two favorites the favorites are chatting

1326.02 --> 1329.77
yay

1326.77 --> 1337.57
all right cool thank you for the super

1329.77 --> 1340.21
Chad Amanda yo smooches right yeah the

1337.57 --> 1343.4199999999998
Jose made a video lying our winner or

1340.21 --> 1347.14
something like that but it was and he

1343.42 --> 1349.8400000000001
was good advertisement it was basically

1347.14 --> 1352.0300000000002
just a typical action of trying to prod

1349.84 --> 1354.37
it's kind of what the ballers also do an

1352.03 --> 1356.5
E is technically a baller it's like try

1354.37 --> 1358.81
the problem to make make me make a

1356.5 --> 1360.46
response video which I never do and he

1358.81 --> 1363.1299999999999
should know that I never ever do that I

1360.46 --> 1365.08
address things on my show and that's as

1363.13 --> 1367.93
far as I would be willing to go but

1365.08 --> 1371.29
apparently had this big objection about

1367.93 --> 1374.8600000000001
how I said that he's basically doing it

1371.29 --> 1376.99
all for the money and he was really

1374.86 --> 1380.05
pissed off about that and I was kind of

1376.99 --> 1383.92
shocked because I didn't even mean that

1380.05 --> 1387.46
as an insult you know it's just like so

1383.92 --> 1390.97
I I have to now correct myself basically

1387.46 --> 1394.66
say okay he is doing it for the fun of

1390.97 --> 1396.28
it and and of course also bid for the

1394.66 --> 1398.0800000000002
money because you have to get around I

1396.28 --> 1401.11
have no objection to that you know that

1398.08 --> 1403.21
that's the whole weird thing but yeah

1401.11 --> 1408.1299999999999
apparently lately mildly called him a

1403.21 --> 1410.71
liar which he is but then I said in

1408.13 --> 1412.24
public then I said in public that he did

1410.71 --> 1414.6100000000001
it all for the money that was apparently

1412.24 --> 1417.34
too much friends so that's why he made

1414.61 --> 1419.1299999999999
that video and yeah I take it back he

1417.34 --> 1421.6
doesn't do it all for the money

1419.13 --> 1423.25
well maybe he thought you meant that he

1421.6 --> 1425.74
switched to the ball for the money or

1423.25 --> 1428.8
something something like that would be

1425.74 --> 1430.72
insulting but no I can't think of

1428.8 --> 1433.0
anything else being that insulting about

1430.72 --> 1433.54
that because it you got to work and eat

1433.0 --> 1436.06
and

1433.54 --> 1437.8
earn money yeah well if he thought it up

1436.06 --> 1441.4299999999998
like that that's not what I meant at all

1437.8 --> 1444.49
no I didn't switch for the money no he

1441.43 --> 1446.53
didn't really care probably too much he

1444.49 --> 1449.71
was just fooling around and he's just

1446.53 --> 1451.81
yeah he's just going where he can do his

1449.71 --> 1456.31
thing and because he think that's fun

1451.81 --> 1459.4299999999998
and yeah money is always welcome that

1456.31 --> 1461.56
kind of thing and he does like Ozzy into

1459.43 --> 1464.2
being all trendy and attention-grabbing

1461.56 --> 1465.85
so yeah that is also technically doing

1464.2 --> 1472.78
it for the money when you do that when

1465.85 --> 1474.34
you adapt to that know that I mean he's

1472.78 --> 1477.73
always been nice to me when I'm over

1474.34 --> 1481.1799999999998
there and you know and like when I get

1477.73 --> 1486.57
on the platform it's usually pretty good

1481.18 --> 1490.0
you know so I got you know I think he's

1486.57 --> 1493.27
a decent youtuber you know and to give

1490.0 --> 1495.91
him that there's much worse places out

1493.27 --> 1497.71
there for sure he's he's definitely a

1495.91 --> 1500.44
baller though and that's not that's our

1497.71 --> 1503.23
opposite side so you know there's gonna

1500.44 --> 1505.15
be some heat going back and forth he's

1503.23 --> 1508.3600000000001
on the other team you know he's not on

1505.15 --> 1514.15
my team you know but we can all be civil

1508.36 --> 1516.6699999999998
I guess yeah nice we like but what I

1514.15 --> 1518.8000000000002
think is like I mean the issue is it a

1516.67 --> 1520.42
lot of people get and I'm not saying

1518.8 --> 1522.94
Jose because maybe he thought you meant

1520.42 --> 1525.88
something else but like like a lot of

1522.94 --> 1528.13
times when like it'll be a baller flat

1525.88 --> 1530.17
earther debate or two flat earthers or

1528.13 --> 1532.96
two ballers it's always because somebody

1530.17 --> 1535.69
is like way too sensitive you know like

1532.96 --> 1537.55
way too sensitive about like they'll

1535.69 --> 1540.25
have an idea and someone will [ __ ] on it

1537.55 --> 1542.9199999999998
and you know they'll have you know some

1540.25 --> 1544.78
some big reaction to it you know like

1542.92 --> 1547.0
it's the end of the world like like that

1544.78 --> 1548.5
you're like t like if you say their

1547.0 --> 1552.76
argument is bad it's like you're saying

1548.5 --> 1554.86
they're bad or something you know right

1552.76 --> 1556.81
well it could be like their their

1554.86 --> 1559.09
personal project that they've been very

1556.81 --> 1561.4299999999998
enthusiastic about and then when you

1559.09 --> 1563.53
just break it apart just like that yeah

1561.43 --> 1565.8400000000001
that hurts a lot because it kind of is

1563.53 --> 1566.69
their little pet thingy that they were

1565.84 --> 1568.039
working on

1566.69 --> 1570.559
they were thought at thinking they were

1568.039 --> 1572.929
getting somewhere so you're really only

1570.559 --> 1574.369
doing them a favor when you when you

1572.929 --> 1576.259
break it apart you show them it doesn't

1574.369 --> 1578.799
work even though they might be up bet

1576.259 --> 1581.1490000000001
you're really helping them right yeah

1578.799 --> 1582.95
you got to tell them right you can't

1581.149 --> 1587.09
just let somebody gone with with

1582.95 --> 1589.159
nonsense right well yeah it's not

1587.09 --> 1593.2099999999998
helping anyone if you just let him a

1589.159 --> 1594.7
blur Karen on so was it I wanted to ask

1593.21 --> 1598.909
you a question

1594.7 --> 1601.82
okay so okay on the baller side the

1598.909 --> 1606.1390000000001
heliocentric side right some people say

1601.82 --> 1609.6789999999999
that light has physicality right and and

1606.139 --> 1613.1789999999999
and they also in and also if you

1609.679 --> 1616.789
presuppose gravity right how how does

1613.179 --> 1620.21
right even though I know that this is

1616.789 --> 1626.09
complete nonsense right how does a

1620.21 --> 1633.8890000000001
photon right break away from the Sun's

1626.09 --> 1638.149
gravity to go towards the earth it it

1633.889 --> 1642.109
it's not stopped it's not stopped so

1638.149 --> 1645.59
it's it's not so John right stream speed

1642.109 --> 1648.019
what gravity now this is menu you dig

1645.59 --> 1651.349
it's a really big presuppositional do do

1648.019 --> 1654.979
here and I'll explain nice yes explain

1651.349 --> 1657.4089999999999
it from scratch look what first what

1654.979 --> 1663.979
they presuppose is that light is like

1657.409 --> 1667.0700000000002
this really really small light weighted

1663.979 --> 1669.6190000000001
super small mass not masses but super

1667.07 --> 1672.619
small mass particle that's kind of what

1669.619 --> 1674.869
they presume then they suggest okay if

1672.619 --> 1678.1999999999998
there's this extreme gravity going on

1674.869 --> 1681.349
like a black hole it'll actually take

1678.2 --> 1683.6290000000001
that micro mass of the light and bend it

1681.349 --> 1685.7
it's that powerful that's basically how

1683.629 --> 1689.389
they suggested but that doesn't mean

1685.7 --> 1691.3300000000002
that from both presuppositions on in

1689.389 --> 1696.099
that it is strong enough to actually

1691.33 --> 1698.509
slow down light in its light speed path

1696.099 --> 1700.4289999999999
like that's not possible

1698.509 --> 1704.45
because it's to the woods

1700.429 --> 1706.73
when when you say that there's gas with

1704.45 --> 1709.009
no intermolecular bonds right I know

1706.73 --> 1712.369
we're talking a different thing now but

1709.009 --> 1715.159
like they say gravity stops the gas from

1712.369 --> 1721.759
leaving the earth right but they're

1715.159 --> 1724.5490000000002
saying oh you're literally filling up

1721.759 --> 1726.59
the globe cosmology already duck such a

1724.549 --> 1728.57
difference oppositional whole don't stop

1726.59 --> 1731.72
it talk about freakin a gas pressure

1728.57 --> 1734.289
nonsense now please I'm not trying to

1731.72 --> 1737.69
reconstruct a proper globe model here

1734.289 --> 1739.82
right none of it makes sense but like

1737.69 --> 1743.5700000000002
even if you give them everything nothing

1739.82 --> 1745.1
makes sense they just want to move on to

1743.57 --> 1747.32
the next topic like clique they'll

1745.1 --> 1749.6899999999998
they'll give us all kinds of grief about

1747.32 --> 1751.789
well how does the Sun work how does the

1749.69 --> 1754.309
moon work I mean if you tell them hey

1751.789 --> 1756.679
look on your model the moon doesn't work

1754.309 --> 1757.19
like they just want to move on to the

1756.679 --> 1759.289
next thing

1757.19 --> 1761.509
yeah well yeah now we can't breathe

1759.289 --> 1762.799
because there's no gas right but and

1761.509 --> 1764.419
then they want to move on to the next

1762.799 --> 1766.009
thing about curve but why are we talking

1764.419 --> 1769.6390000000001
about curve you haven't solved any of

1766.009 --> 1773.6
this stuff like like just the gas part

1769.639 --> 1775.639
alone is over you know what I mean like

1773.6 --> 1777.769
they're arguing about what light does

1775.639 --> 1780.619
around a curve but they still have no

1777.769 --> 1784.09
way to have gas to breathe yeah but

1780.619 --> 1787.009
they're working on it like forever

1784.09 --> 1788.9599999999998
painting they can they can't connect the

1787.009 --> 1791.299
parts but they can keep on painting the

1788.96 --> 1792.8600000000001
middle in between parts and they just

1791.299 --> 1794.779
keep on moving from one part to the

1792.86 --> 1796.61
other not connecting it but they're

1794.779 --> 1800.269
still working on it that's kind of what

1796.61 --> 1802.85
they do this thing is a mess it's it's

1800.269 --> 1804.71
it's almost I would say the word is

1802.85 --> 1806.899
untenable at this point it is

1804.71 --> 1810.669
technically and it has been for a long

1806.899 --> 1815.6899999999998
time but that doesn't cancel on it

1810.669 --> 1817.909
there's just no way you know I mean

1815.69 --> 1820.429
unless you're gonna say that for you

1817.909 --> 1823.279
know however many billions of years they

1820.429 --> 1825.499
say Earth has been here right that that

1823.279 --> 1828.23
that rock has been swinging around Earth

1825.499 --> 1831.73
in such a perfect motion to never even

1828.23 --> 1833.03
see one millimeter of another side of it

1831.73 --> 1835.83
the

1833.03 --> 1838.26
you know what I feel like it would have

1835.83 --> 1840.1789999999999
to be so perfect for that many years in

1838.26 --> 1843.42
a row we didn't bump in the name rocks

1840.179 --> 1847.14
we didn't bump it into any you know

1843.42 --> 1850.17
right Joey had shall I mad more nonsense

1847.14 --> 1852.15
to the soup then okay so yes imagine

1850.17 --> 1856.1100000000001
that the moon technically wasn't there

1852.15 --> 1859.679
from Big Bang formation on because it

1856.11 --> 1862.77
formed after a outside object smashed

1859.679 --> 1866.0900000000001
into the pre earth and then the moon

1862.77 --> 1869.94
came out of that and then when settling

1866.09 --> 1871.49
became perfectly uniform like that so it

1869.94 --> 1874.919
wasn't even in the original

1871.49 --> 1877.799
crystallization you know no it's in a

1874.919 --> 1888.8090000000002
coincidence splat and then it perfectly

1877.799 --> 1892.28
uniformly faces the earth forever in

1888.809 --> 1895.44
their model know that the yeah sorry

1892.28 --> 1897.66
fulfills the process on earth it you

1895.44 --> 1900.48
have to have the moon if the moon fell

1897.66 --> 1902.669
out of the sky we would die but stay

1900.48 --> 1906.75
Thea story right the moon wasn't there

1902.669 --> 1909.419
yeah yeah another great smashed into us

1906.75 --> 1914.22
then the moon ejected in molten iron

1909.419 --> 1918.99
core and then the moon was formed oh my

1914.22 --> 1921.33
god how did you get us to like not only

1918.99 --> 1923.13
did I believe this stuff Arwen but I

1921.33 --> 1925.049
used to think this stuff was brilliant

1923.13 --> 1927.3600000000001
you know like when I used to like think

1925.049 --> 1931.34
it's brilliant it's deluge you know but

1927.36 --> 1934.74
it is brilliant in its delusion its

1931.34 --> 1939.84
artistic abet it's so consistent in its

1934.74 --> 1941.7
inconsistencies it is like it's exactly

1939.84 --> 1943.98
you're exactly right because none of it

1941.7 --> 1946.53
works but everything has been worked on

1943.98 --> 1948.57
to the point of like actually working

1946.53 --> 1951.27
and then they move on to something else

1948.57 --> 1953.1
to where nothing is ever finished like

1951.27 --> 1955.62
like if you said okay we have gas

1953.1 --> 1957.809
pressure here and a dome somehow formed

1955.62 --> 1960.58
and now we have gas pressure now that's

1957.809 --> 1961.87
a solved problem now we can move on to

1960.58 --> 1963.9089999999999
you know this is what happened to the

1961.87 --> 1966.549
moon right but no they say the air is

1963.909 --> 1969.0100000000002
stuck here no barrier you're okay now

1966.549 --> 1971.9189999999999
let's move on to the moon and then some

1969.01 --> 1974.799
planet through a car into the earth and

1971.919 --> 1976.5700000000002
then you know they add all this stuff

1974.799 --> 1980.1689999999999
but they never finish it to where it's a

1976.57 --> 1988.809
working thing you know it's it's just

1980.169 --> 1990.88
vain babbling yeah but I'm worried in

1988.809 --> 1994.299
their minds then it can work you know

1990.88 --> 1998.6200000000001
it's like you have a really awesome 3d

1994.299 --> 2001.26
puzzle thing or Legos something and you

1998.62 --> 2003.36
have the image and you can build it but

2001.26 --> 2007.289
there's like it there seems to be pieces

2003.36 --> 2008.9699999999998
missing and you can't figure it out but

2007.289 --> 2010.26
yeah you can keep on building it and

2008.97 --> 2012.72
building it it's never going to be

2010.26 --> 2014.82
complete though but can still be a lot

2012.72 --> 2017.34
of fun and especially you know what it

2014.82 --> 2019.4399999999998
might even be more alluring if you can't

2017.34 --> 2022.889
finish it because then it's like that

2019.44 --> 2026.1000000000001
thing that you never got to finish that

2022.889 --> 2030.35
may actually bind people to keep on

2026.1 --> 2034.11
doing it more than if it was finishable

2030.35 --> 2038.1899999999998
yeah because I mean even if okay so even

2034.11 --> 2040.35
if the heliocentric model is the way it

2038.19 --> 2043.529
is you still have to have a certain

2040.35 --> 2046.5
amount of faith that in space travel

2043.529 --> 2047.88
that one day the human beings will get

2046.5 --> 2050.55
somewhere and it might not be in your

2047.88 --> 2053.639
lifetime you know so even if it was

2050.55 --> 2056.07
fully functional you still have this

2053.639 --> 2058.44
just this faith this leaps you have to

2056.07 --> 2060.54
make right but instead not only do we

2058.44 --> 2062.129
not have a functioning model like they

2060.54 --> 2064.379
they have to take all these leaps now

2062.129 --> 2066.45
you know we before even leaving the

2064.379 --> 2070.139
earth you know to the point where they

2066.45 --> 2072.089
had to fake it you know it's insanity

2070.139 --> 2075.06
man well they have to fake it on many

2072.089 --> 2078.149
levels and they even try to fake it in

2075.06 --> 2081.659
the minds of people like what they a

2078.149 --> 2083.8489999999997
standard part of the higher tier mind

2081.659 --> 2085.859
control is to really make people face

2083.849 --> 2089.25
the truth like yeah how does this look

2085.859 --> 2091.29
flat and then just tell them yeah but it

2089.25 --> 2094.09
looks are deceiving you're you cannot

2091.29 --> 2097.3
trust your eyes because light is action

2094.09 --> 2100.54
around the globe so it may look flat but

2097.3 --> 2103.3300000000004
it's actually curved and then if people

2100.54 --> 2105.43
take that puzzle and basically manage to

2103.33 --> 2108.2999999999997
finish it to move on to the next

2105.43 --> 2114.0
obstacle whatever they're dealing with

2108.3 --> 2119.23
then it's kind of set like that's okay

2114.0 --> 2121.6
like it's okay it's apparently that is

2119.23 --> 2124.63
the thing that people do they look at

2121.6 --> 2126.85
the flat world and then say yeah but

2124.63 --> 2131.86
that's only a deception of my eyes

2126.85 --> 2133.87
because in reality it's a ball see they

2131.86 --> 2136.57
try to do that to me too and I kind of

2133.87 --> 2140.38
fell for that when I was younger and

2136.57 --> 2142.51
that oh that's a real if you really go

2140.38 --> 2145.12
through that cycle without realizing it

2142.51 --> 2148.3300000000004
then it really and grinds itself pretty

2145.12 --> 2150.7
deeply on your spirit because it's

2148.33 --> 2153.0699999999997
basically you telling yourself allowing

2150.7 --> 2156.25
yourself to be told I can trust what I

2153.07 --> 2158.77
see I have to figure something out

2156.25 --> 2161.26
in between in order to make it into

2158.77 --> 2163.78
something else in my mind virtually of

2161.26 --> 2168.4
what it is instead of just looking at it

2163.78 --> 2170.5600000000004
as it right like I have to there has to

2168.4 --> 2172.57
be a level of figuring it out before I

2170.56 --> 2175.39
have full understanding of what what

2172.57 --> 2177.9100000000003
things are in front of me like you're

2175.39 --> 2181.6
putting like this extra level in between

2177.91 --> 2183.75
you and reality thinking that it'll give

2181.6 --> 2189.39
you better understanding of reality

2183.75 --> 2191.56
right it actually makes you evading

2189.39 --> 2194.41
that's right that's right

2191.56 --> 2196.48
and I almost think at this point right

2194.41 --> 2198.25
like I think I know a lot of people say

2196.48 --> 2203.68
like okay these ballers really do

2198.25 --> 2206.56
believe it and and it's just like they

2203.68 --> 2208.4199999999996
can't they can't see it or they they

2206.56 --> 2211.7799999999997
really do believe it's a ball you know

2208.42 --> 2214.87
I'm at the point now where I'm I think

2211.78 --> 2216.52
sometimes like at least some people they

2214.87 --> 2218.74
know it's a ball and they're just

2216.52 --> 2221.83
straight up just straight up lying

2218.74 --> 2224.08
because it's they would rather win then

2221.83 --> 2226.93
know the truth they would rather you

2224.08 --> 2227.5299999999997
believe it and laugh at you you know

2226.93 --> 2229.7799999999997
then

2227.53 --> 2233.98
for you to know the truth I mean just

2229.78 --> 2236.2900000000004
just like like Minea some kind of [ __ ]

2233.98 --> 2238.93
disturber to you know any part of my

2236.29 --> 2239.5299999999997
language to want to be that type of

2238.93 --> 2242.29
person

2239.53 --> 2244.69
you know so every time someone makes a

2242.29 --> 2247.33
point a good point they say none of your

2244.69 --> 2249.37
points are good you know nothing you

2247.33 --> 2251.97
brought up no flat-earthers ever brought

2249.37 --> 2256.15
up any point that was ever even

2251.97 --> 2258.7599999999998
interesting you know that's not true but

2256.15 --> 2259.78
that is political rhetoric technically

2258.76 --> 2262.69
when they do that

2259.78 --> 2265.7200000000003
that's mimicking what a lot of people

2262.69 --> 2270.61
have done throughout even government and

2265.72 --> 2273.6699999999996
news media and talk-show hosts it's just

2270.61 --> 2275.77
a thing and that if you get that type of

2273.67 --> 2278.65
example of like this is the response

2275.77 --> 2281.62
like from an authority position that's

2278.65 --> 2284.6800000000003
very easy to mimic and because it's a

2281.62 --> 2287.08
scene everywhere people will know how to

2284.68 --> 2289.06
respond to that and probably be like oh

2287.08 --> 2292.09
yeah yeah just like my teacher right

2289.06 --> 2294.43
without thinking about it see so their

2292.09 --> 2297.78
response socially without really

2294.43 --> 2301.8399999999997
realizing whether it's true or not

2297.78 --> 2303.4
those are the conditioning and then it's

2301.84 --> 2305.98
like it's like you'll run into these

2303.4 --> 2308.14
people that'll be like well you know

2305.98 --> 2308.53
this isn't even something that's up for

2308.14 --> 2311.5
debate

2308.53 --> 2314.05
you know we already know that the earth

2311.5 --> 2317.32
is a globe we've benefitted from

2314.05 --> 2321.19
thousands of years of science and it's

2317.32 --> 2326.04
not even debatable like that to me

2321.19 --> 2327.9700000000003
that's crazy that is just even

2326.04 --> 2331.18
nonsensical in its own because they're

2327.97 --> 2333.43
like the amount of actual research that

2331.18 --> 2339.97
was put in all that is not thousands of

2333.43 --> 2342.31
years at all yeah it's no but for me no

2339.97 --> 2345.6699999999996
more than a hundred years total together

2342.31 --> 2348.13
right yeah and the rest I leave in the

2345.67 --> 2350.2200000000003
spaces in between things like whatever

2348.13 --> 2353.53
like how much work is there really in

2350.22 --> 2355.6299999999997
proving it right well if it can't be

2353.53 --> 2357.26
proven then you must uphold a line now

2355.63 --> 2359.1800000000003
that's a task

2357.26 --> 2363.0400000000004
that is never done and when you stop it

2359.18 --> 2365.93
it breaks so maybe from that angle

2363.04 --> 2369.05
because if they're saying that sticks in

2365.93 --> 2373.04
the ground is the you know how they

2369.05 --> 2374.6000000000004
measured the Sun and and from from what

2373.04 --> 2377.18
they're saying it's 2,000 years ago

2374.6 --> 2379.2799999999997
which obviously is in 2000 years ago but

2377.18 --> 2381.9199999999996
like well but even if Eratosthenes did

2379.28 --> 2384.26
exist right you're saying there's never

2381.92 --> 2386.9300000000003
been another method of being able to

2384.26 --> 2388.82
measure it since that point and we're

2386.93 --> 2390.0499999999997
just gonna go with that now knowing that

2388.82 --> 2394.4900000000002
that's not right

2390.05 --> 2398.3900000000003
you know you understand what I'm saying

2394.49 --> 2400.7
no sorry say again so okay so if they

2398.39 --> 2402.62
say okay well we measured the distance

2400.7 --> 2403.43
to the Sun it's Aristophanes it's

2402.62 --> 2405.3199999999997
already done

2403.43 --> 2406.91
right and then I'm like well how do you

2405.32 --> 2408.5
guys measure it now you know if like if

2406.91 --> 2409.19
you wanted to measure the Sun today how

2408.5 --> 2411.71
would you do it

2409.19 --> 2415.43
Oh Aristophanes already did it but they

2411.71 --> 2420.56
don't do it they just say he did right

2415.43 --> 2423.68
all right calculation nonsense never did

2420.56 --> 2425.99
any measurements just said he measured

2423.68 --> 2427.73
it his head off hit I don't even know if

2425.99 --> 2429.7999999999997
he said he measured it I think he

2427.73 --> 2435.23
probably just said no I just calculated

2429.8 --> 2440.2400000000002
it and then we measured it well he just

2435.23 --> 2442.34
said no I calculated it you know it's

2440.24 --> 2445.85
always some technicality or some kind of

2442.34 --> 2448.4
weird you know it's a trick man some

2445.85 --> 2450.08
magic right he has a yeah I haven't yet

2448.4 --> 2452.48
I have justice respond to this yeah it

2450.08 --> 2455.54
has since been repeated that's right

2452.48 --> 2459.47
people have repeated the calculation and

2455.54 --> 2463.07
not actually a measurement that's righti

2459.47 --> 2468.7999999999997
heaven that's correct yeah don't put R

2463.07 --> 2471.73
in the equation and see how you do try

2468.8 --> 2471.73
to do it without our

2477.57 --> 2484.69
every model being scaled up on or down

2481.72 --> 2486.97
and then yeah the distance is

2484.69 --> 2491.65
extrapolated based on the wireframe

2486.97 --> 2493.2999999999997
model of the whole globe system all

2491.65 --> 2498.37
these dummy astrological charts

2493.3 --> 2501.6600000000003
basically like like I I could okay I

2498.37 --> 2504.4
could sit on my couch right and and and

2501.66 --> 2507.7599999999998
and you know calculate plat points to

2504.4 --> 2511.54
all the you know lights in the sky right

2507.76 --> 2514.1800000000003
and and say okay well we must be living

2511.54 --> 2516.37
on a couch because it only calculates if

2514.18 --> 2518.2
you're on a couch well it's because I

2516.37 --> 2521.38
made the math based on me being on the

2518.2 --> 2524.74
couch you know what I mean like if I I

2521.38 --> 2527.4100000000003
could plot those points to anything to a

2524.74 --> 2533.1099999999997
sphere a cube of flat surface anything I

2527.41 --> 2535.0899999999997
want right you know what I mean and so

2533.11 --> 2537.67
like when they say oh it can only work

2535.09 --> 2539.02
on a sphere it's because you assumed you

2537.67 --> 2541.9300000000003
were on a sphere when you were plotting

2539.02 --> 2543.34
those points so without your assumption

2541.93 --> 2545.6499999999996
that you're on a sphere it'll it won't

2543.34 --> 2548.7400000000002
work the math won't work because you

2545.65 --> 2550.21
started out with saying okay I'm on a

2548.74 --> 2551.9199999999996
curved surface and this is the

2550.21 --> 2553.36
measurement of the curve service and

2551.92 --> 2556.0
this is where I plot all those points

2553.36 --> 2557.59
now if you erase all that crap and you

2556.0 --> 2559.9
start plotting the points from a flat

2557.59 --> 2562.15
earth and you'll get that you'll get the

2559.9 --> 2565.11
same the same type of perfect great math

2562.15 --> 2568.6600000000003
it'll just be plotted on a different

2565.11 --> 2570.79
surface yeah well it all depends on the

2568.66 --> 2574.77
map orientation though but if you take a

2570.79 --> 2577.63
if you start a disk map then the

2574.77 --> 2579.73
presuppositions are the triangulation

2577.63 --> 2582.46
based presupposition of a literal

2579.73 --> 2586.78
location for the Sun will approximately

2582.46 --> 2592.4700000000003
point out to be 3000 meters high I think

2586.78 --> 2595.03
all right that's a position cuz there

2592.47 --> 2597.22
your son is not an object to have a

2595.03 --> 2599.9700000000003
distance ooh it's an optical side effect

2597.22 --> 2604.98
of looking straight into the daylight

2599.97 --> 2608.0499999999997
from the observers point and when you go

2604.98 --> 2611.95
into that light when you follow it

2608.05 --> 2617.92
changes its direction over distance and

2611.95 --> 2622.12
you can never reach it right that's true

2617.92 --> 2626.19
because if it was if it was physical it

2622.12 --> 2628.48
would have like spatial consequences

2626.19 --> 2632.32
like what boy and you get closer to it

2628.48 --> 2634.3
it will get way bigger yeah for example

2632.32 --> 2636.55
or there would probably be some

2634.3 --> 2639.73
intensity thing or there would be a

2636.55 --> 2641.38
point where it suddenly yeah you would

2639.73 --> 2644.2
suddenly out of nowhere I just stopped

2641.38 --> 2647.35
seeing the Sun because you've I don't

2644.2 --> 2650.02
know risen exactly but let's just

2647.35 --> 2652.72
imagine that you would be at 3,000

2650.02 --> 2655.69
meters high in some balloon or a

2652.72 --> 2658.27
Zeppelin exactly where the central

2655.69 --> 2660.19
points presuppose point of the Sun would

2658.27 --> 2662.74
have to be at that point so are you

2660.19 --> 2664.87
gonna be still staring at a sunbeam and

2662.74 --> 2668.14
maybe it'll be very intense or something

2664.87 --> 2672.04
and then you rise slightly above it and

2668.14 --> 2674.1099999999997
it's like over there you don't see it

2672.04 --> 2677.74
anymore you see this big spotlight under

2674.11 --> 2680.59
you but you don't see anymore sun source

2677.74 --> 2684.3399999999997
now that's something I imagine might be

2680.59 --> 2689.23
a possibility if that were that would be

2684.34 --> 2692.4700000000003
a dangerous mission to find out well you

2689.23 --> 2695.05
would have rise like at 3,000 meters at

2692.47 --> 2698.41
best that that is that it completely

2695.05 --> 2701.6800000000003
impossible no I mean you'd have to

2698.41 --> 2705.7599999999998
assume well it's definitely higher up

2701.68 --> 2707.1099999999997
than 120,000 feet right because when

2705.76 --> 2710.53
those balloons get up there you could

2707.11 --> 2712.1200000000003
see the Sun right and so like you would

2710.53 --> 2716.2000000000003
have to assume that there's much more

2712.12 --> 2718.62
than that to go up it might I mean

2716.2 --> 2721.7799999999997
but these it has the presupposition

2718.62 --> 2724.33
technicals the triangulation points out

2721.78 --> 2727.5400000000004
it should be a 3000 meters you know

2724.33 --> 2730.72
that's how the line-of-sight system

2727.54 --> 2733.42
works over the disk model so it is worth

2730.72 --> 2736.1499999999996
testing at my opinion like okay let's go

2733.42 --> 2737.23
in that circle right that they over show

2736.15 --> 2740.11
on the model thingy

2737.23 --> 2741.16
let's literally put a balloon right

2740.11 --> 2742.75
there why

2741.16 --> 2747.549
it's gonna happen is it gonna pop and

2742.75 --> 2750.369
burn you know or is it are you another

2747.549 --> 2752.349
effect you know because I'm pretty sure

2750.369 --> 2756.039
that it's not gonna bump into a giant

2752.349 --> 2757.3900000000003
fireball it's definitely not a fireball

2756.039 --> 2760.69
because it's always the perfect

2757.39 --> 2764.98
temperature for us to live in you know

2760.69 --> 2767.89
like if something and whatever idea of

2764.98 --> 2770.079
any physical constructs I don't think

2767.89 --> 2771.7
it's that no but it what I'm saying is I

2770.079 --> 2774.13
don't think it will get warmer the

2771.7 --> 2778.6299999999997
higher up you get you know I think it's

2774.13 --> 2780.579
just a light I don't think you will get

2778.63 --> 2782.799
warmer the heart oh yeah I guess you do

2780.579 --> 2784.27
get sunburned more when you go higher

2782.799 --> 2786.339
but that's I guess because there's less

2784.27 --> 2789.819
dense atmosphere right exactly

2786.339 --> 2792.16
so there's more less of the Sun being

2789.819 --> 2795.73
absorbed by the matter locally and

2792.16 --> 2798.46
instead is absorbed by you okay well

2795.73 --> 2801.73
this is the intensity of the light

2798.46 --> 2804.94
itself is increased the the net

2801.73 --> 2807.88
percentage in a specific location you

2804.94 --> 2811.059
know it doesn't decrease in strength

2807.88 --> 2815.25
over distance what about the inverse

2811.059 --> 2817.63
square law though of light no sorry

2815.25 --> 2823.059
inverse square law wouldn't it have to

2817.63 --> 2827.71
be brighter as you get closer to it if

2823.059 --> 2829.51
it was actually a lamp yes you know with

2827.71 --> 2832.059
physical light sources that we can

2829.51 --> 2835.599
create yeah the intensity will decrease

2832.059 --> 2838.27
over distance but with the Sun in my

2835.599 --> 2840.1600000000003
conception is not a physical object with

2838.27 --> 2844.5099999999998
any literal location it's just like

2840.16 --> 2847.93
manifests in a certain pattern with the

2844.51 --> 2851.5890000000004
Sun disk as a visual side effect for all

2847.93 --> 2853.1189999999997
observers and then the heat would just

2851.589 --> 2855.5789999999997
come from somewhere else it would

2853.119 --> 2860.109
basically be literally manifesting in

2855.579 --> 2863.9500000000003
the place itself on every part so there

2860.109 --> 2867.0099999999998
is like every position makes you see the

2863.95 --> 2868.75
same type of light apparition beam

2867.01 --> 2870.4900000000002
coming from a location towards you and

2868.75 --> 2872.539
it just keeps on moving with you

2870.49 --> 2875.1499999999996
changing slightly maybe in the

2872.539 --> 2878.119
action but I think that the amount of

2875.15 --> 2881.9790000000003
light intensity is exactly the same at

2878.119 --> 2885.2290000000003
every location where you are within the

2881.979 --> 2886.6989999999996
the day cycle wow you're getting into

2885.229 --> 2890.0589999999997
like where everyone has their own

2886.699 --> 2893.359
personal Sun I've been saying that for a

2890.059 --> 2896.949
long time but not just some uh the

2893.359 --> 2901.7889999999998
entire globe of the heavens all of it

2896.949 --> 2904.189
it's also we all have so we is it that

2901.789 --> 2906.949
we all have our own angle to where the

2904.189 --> 2913.509
Sun is or that we all have our own Sun

2906.949 --> 2917.66
from our point of view we have our own

2913.509 --> 2919.369
so is the rainbow is a rainbow a thing

2917.66 --> 2920.839
or does everybody if there's a rainbow

2919.369 --> 2922.609
visible does everybody see their own

2920.839 --> 2926.449
personal rainbow it's like a hologram

2922.609 --> 2930.169
it's like a personal effect visually so

2926.449 --> 2932.539
yeah there is no Sun the sudden is an

2930.169 --> 2934.0389999999998
apparition it's not real it's not a

2932.539 --> 2935.989
physical thing even though the mind

2934.039 --> 2938.469
likes to make it physical because

2935.989 --> 2941.719
otherwise it just blows our mind right

2938.469 --> 2947.239
physicality assumption bias but there is

2941.719 --> 2949.549
no Sun it's just an effect there's just

2947.239 --> 2951.799
like there's just light and I don't know

2949.549 --> 2956.65
why it just manifests it's not coming

2951.799 --> 2961.819
from anything it's just manifesting like

2956.65 --> 2965.2090000000003
I think I found a way to to measure the

2961.819 --> 2967.099
Sun right but it would be I wouldn't say

2965.209 --> 2969.769
measure the Sun empirically but like

2967.099 --> 2972.4390000000003
closer than anything we've got right now

2969.769 --> 2975.109
and I'm still working on it right but

2972.439 --> 2979.5789999999997
like okay you know how like when you

2975.109 --> 2982.489
hold a light over like a flat surface I

2979.579 --> 2984.9190000000003
call like a you know a big long hallway

2982.489 --> 2987.259
or big floor or whatever like just a

2984.919 --> 2991.0389999999998
little flashlight above it and then you

2987.259 --> 2993.229
pull back like a camera from the floor

2991.039 --> 2996.1200000000003
like if you keep going back enough

2993.229 --> 2998.66
distance like that light will disappear

2996.12 --> 3001.8089999999997
[Music]

2998.66 --> 3004.359
like that light will set just like the

3001.809 --> 3007.239
Sun you know if it's a certain distance

3004.359 --> 3009.339
away on the flat surface so it's alright

3007.239 --> 3012.2490000000003
if you can if you can bring that if you

3009.339 --> 3017.64
can know the distance to scale you know

3012.249 --> 3020.47
to like bring it into into focus right

3017.64 --> 3023.019
you'll know how much distance if you can

3020.47 --> 3025.029
scale the Sun which the best thing I can

3023.019 --> 3027.64
do to scale the Sun at this point is

3025.029 --> 3030.609
that 70 mile wide shadow of the moon

3027.64 --> 3033.339
which is not the Sun I get it but like

3030.609 --> 3035.8289999999997
if it I mean if you believe in creation

3033.339 --> 3039.97
and they're probably the same size so

3035.829 --> 3040.42
it's either 70 or 72 miles you know what

3039.97 --> 3043.359
I mean

3040.42 --> 3047.319
I know we're getting into a lotta just

3043.359 --> 3049.21
deep you know horse manure

3047.319 --> 3051.729
right now right but if we would have

3049.21 --> 3054.789
left me here I have two completely lost

3051.729 --> 3056.8289999999997
track sorry okay so if we scale the Sun

3054.789 --> 3059.7690000000002
right and say that it is the same size

3056.829 --> 3062.44
as the moon and the only alright the

3059.769 --> 3064.839
only the disc model right right

3062.44 --> 3067.9
you're not H if you're gonna press it

3064.839 --> 3071.739
okay okay and so we're gonna use the 70

3067.9 --> 3074.289
70 mile wide shadow of the moon right

3071.739 --> 3076.359
and say okay well if the son of the moon

3074.289 --> 3078.369
is the same size right and so I know

3076.359 --> 3080.979
it's a lot of preset position right

3078.369 --> 3088.089
there already right you say okay a 70

3080.979 --> 3090.3689999999997
mile wide Sun you know and then you and

3088.089 --> 3092.17
then you pull the your camera bat so you

3090.369 --> 3093.9100000000003
have your flashlight and that represents

3092.17 --> 3096.16
70 miles whatever the scale of that

3093.91 --> 3098.469
light is and then you pull it back and

3096.16 --> 3100.8689999999997
when it disappears that's how far you're

3098.469 --> 3102.579
away from the Sun when it sets and how

3100.869 --> 3104.44
high it would have to be I mean it would

3102.579 --> 3106.3590000000004
be a mathematical construct and it still

3104.44 --> 3108.94
wouldn't be correct because you would

3106.359 --> 3111.43
have to create like you would have to

3108.94 --> 3113.17
create how high you think it is and how

3111.43 --> 3115.749
wide it is but if you go by three

3113.17 --> 3118.4790000000003
thousand and seventy miles right back

3115.749 --> 3122.019
that's not like incredibly unfair to say

3118.479 --> 3124.45
it's it's it's way way less absurd than

3122.019 --> 3127.9599999999996
this 93 million miles crap from

3124.45 --> 3129.8799999999997
harris-dawson YZ I I mean that might

3127.96 --> 3131.29
give us a closer sorry to say that

3129.88 --> 3133.96
you've completely

3131.29 --> 3134.83
asked me I literally have no idea [ __ ]

3133.96 --> 3137.02
you're talking about

3134.83 --> 3139.99
this sounds like a weird no I'm not this

3137.02 --> 3141.64
is not criticism just confused because

3139.99 --> 3143.68
you're I think you're trying to like

3141.64 --> 3145.48
create a machination basically like the

3143.68 --> 3147.46
globe is do based on the disk model it's

3145.48 --> 3149.7400000000002
something that a lot of people did five

3147.46 --> 3152.7400000000002
years ago on the flatter side I don't

3149.74 --> 3156.31
even understand what what is the point

3152.74 --> 3158.35
here shadow shadow like I don't think

3156.31 --> 3160.36
that even though it is the standard

3158.35 --> 3163.12
discourse think that the moon is a

3160.36 --> 3165.19
literal ball that has the shadow of the

3163.12 --> 3168.2799999999997
Sun I don't think they latch on to that

3165.19 --> 3171.61
because they're usually going by them

3168.28 --> 3173.65
being there in the lesser light you know

3171.61 --> 3176.4700000000003
so they recognize the moon is not a

3173.65 --> 3179.38
physical object so I know that I know

3176.47 --> 3182.3199999999997
that I'm saying they did like the the

3179.38 --> 3185.5
gist of the apparent distance right yep

3182.32 --> 3188.56
so like if this shadow is 70 miles then

3185.5 --> 3190.36
it can't be bigger than that it's

3188.56 --> 3193.84
completely useless because you're

3190.36 --> 3198.1600000000003
already that thinking that it is a

3193.84 --> 3199.92
physical shadow only begins to work in a

3198.16 --> 3203.47
heliocentric conception

3199.92 --> 3205.66
if you step away from those large

3203.47 --> 3208.6299999999997
distances then it makes no freakin sense

3205.66 --> 3211.0299999999997
anymore to even presuppose that it's

3208.63 --> 3213.31
something to be close I was thinking it

3211.03 --> 3215.05
would be it wouldn't be that far I don't

3213.31 --> 3218.29
think it would be that hot that far away

3215.05 --> 3221.1400000000003
I don't know I was thinking less than

3218.29 --> 3223.69
less than 3,000 miles I I guess you got

3221.14 --> 3225.7
it because you're also dumb only using

3223.69 --> 3228.43
the shadows the moon as like ask it to

3225.7 --> 3230.5
scale right and I know that has nothing

3228.43 --> 3232.0
to do with the Sun right we don't know

3230.5 --> 3236.5
what the Sun is or how far it is away

3232.0 --> 3239.26
but if you say okay well if it is 70

3236.5 --> 3240.07
miles wide and if it is 3000 miles high

3239.26 --> 3243.88
right

3240.07 --> 3246.79
how far would you have to go back with

3243.88 --> 3250.96
perspective for it to set below a flat

3246.79 --> 3252.7
surface and still be on the flat surface

3250.96 --> 3255.13
you understand what I'm saying

3252.7 --> 3258.0699999999997
right well that's depends on the

3255.13 --> 3261.37
combination of observer height and light

3258.07 --> 3265.1200000000003
height over distance right you'd have to

3261.37 --> 3265.66
make those assumptions first well you

3265.12 --> 3268.99
have to

3265.66 --> 3271.99
you just have to make sure to know these

3268.99 --> 3275.5589999999997
variables and then you're in tested and

3271.99 --> 3277.7799999999997
compare it because the the obstruction

3275.559 --> 3279.849
or the concealment radius linear over

3277.78 --> 3282.579
distance so if yeah you can just

3279.849 --> 3288.48
cross-reference with it with something

3282.579 --> 3290.8900000000003
else and then you can compare it yeah

3288.48 --> 3293.95
but then but this is my question once

3290.89 --> 3296.109
you get that side figured out can then

3293.95 --> 3298.7799999999997
you go back to what you've presupposed

3296.109 --> 3303.7599999999998
and then use what you have that's

3298.78 --> 3304.599
concrete on the other side to to make

3303.76 --> 3306.579
those two where they're not

3304.599 --> 3311.829
presuppositions anymore so where it's

3306.579 --> 3315.869
based on something real am I getting too

3311.829 --> 3322.15
deep now with that you still lost me

3315.869 --> 3324.9700000000003
I'll have this and show it because I

3322.15 --> 3327.1600000000003
just the point of this at all

3324.97 --> 3329.47
you know you're trying to like get the

3327.16 --> 3332.14
consumer right in and then with lights

3329.47 --> 3335.41
and compare them to heavenly bodies well

3332.14 --> 3337.95
it's so you're blatantly established the

3335.41 --> 3344.3489999999997
heavenly bodies do not have a trajectory

3337.95 --> 3347.5
over a flat earth right so why why it's

3344.349 --> 3349.299
a less a globe it spins visually at the

3347.5 --> 3351.039
edge of vision and then it just goes on

3349.299 --> 3354.43
there it blurs up somewhat at the

3351.039 --> 3357.5690000000004
horizon due to the diffraction effects

3354.43 --> 3361.1499999999996
and that's it I mean you're right this

3357.569 --> 3364.029
the distance it does not move into the

3361.15 --> 3366.01
distance the Stars do not go down and so

3364.029 --> 3366.819
the full length of the horizon that

3366.01 --> 3370.1800000000003
doesn't happen

3366.819 --> 3371.77
no it just so that you are you more of

3370.18 --> 3375.25
the mindset they're like okay well

3371.77 --> 3376.72
listen is it more of okay I'm not saying

3375.25 --> 3379.299
this what you think I'm saying isn't

3376.72 --> 3381.1899999999996
more like this where it's like the Sun

3379.299 --> 3385.059
is just kind of programmed in here and

3381.19 --> 3388.15
it is what it is yeah and it's you know

3385.059 --> 3391.4500000000003
it's an it's not everything is made of

3388.15 --> 3393.64
wood or rock or whatever it like like

3391.45 --> 3395.589
it's programmed in here and in it has

3393.64 --> 3398.95
its function and that's what it does and

3395.589 --> 3401.29
it always does it I don't know you know

3398.95 --> 3403.93
if I'd have to compare it I'd say that

3401.29 --> 3406.21
Sun is more like the visual side effect

3403.93 --> 3409.3289999999997
of being in what you could roughly

3406.21 --> 3412.599
compare it to is like being inside of an

3409.329 --> 3415.0
active microwave like we are being

3412.599 --> 3417.75
electrified but on a frequency that it

3415.0 --> 3421.299
manifests itself in a cyclical light

3417.75 --> 3423.099
manifest pattern and that is our heat

3421.299 --> 3425.319
source that is our energy and it is

3423.099 --> 3427.78
introduced through light it seems and

3425.319 --> 3429.52
there's tension fields correlating with

3427.78 --> 3432.9100000000003
it all that [ __ ] so it's kind of like

3429.52 --> 3436.119
being in an active microwave there's no

3432.91 --> 3439.75
ball of light going around there doing

3436.119 --> 3441.94
that no it's just electricity going in a

3439.75 --> 3444.01
certain pattern and it apparently

3441.94 --> 3447.73
manifests itself is like that is like

3444.01 --> 3452.98
what it that's my closest approach right

3447.73 --> 3454.96
now to what it's a benefit I think I was

3452.98 --> 3457.93
just taking like what was heliocentric

3454.96 --> 3460.63
and then trying to trying to make their

3457.93 --> 3462.52
their thing more realistic when in

3460.63 --> 3466.869
reality it's just a bad thought

3462.52 --> 3471.13
direction to begin with you know what

3466.869 --> 3473.2000000000003
you're saying is more surreal it's just

3471.13 --> 3474.76
yeah it's just so hard to see the world

3473.2 --> 3477.64
that way even though the time that's

3474.76 --> 3480.099
probably true you know it's like we've

3477.64 --> 3482.14
been brainwashed so long like I mean I

3480.099 --> 3484.0
still sometimes slip up and think like

3482.14 --> 3486.19
oh yeah back in the caveman days you

3484.0 --> 3488.44
know before they discovered fire you

3486.19 --> 3490.27
know instead of just thinking that like

3488.44 --> 3492.64
people were here they already knew to

3490.27 --> 3496.299
drink water they already knew what fire

3492.64 --> 3498.3089999999997
was you know like we were created in the

3496.299 --> 3501.609
first person already knew that stuff you

3498.309 --> 3505.75
know like like to assume if we were

3501.609 --> 3507.819
animals and and and evolved and you know

3505.75 --> 3510.369
what I mean and we discovered water oh

3507.819 --> 3512.65
we can drink this this is good you know

3510.369 --> 3516.1600000000003
like it like it was created specifically

3512.65 --> 3518.5
for us and so those two things sometimes

3516.16 --> 3521.2
mash up in my head because I've been

3518.5 --> 3524.77
taught this evolution crap my whole life

3521.2 --> 3527.0789999999997
you know do you think that you know that

3524.77 --> 3531.74
everything every animal started out from

3527.079 --> 3534.42
scratch you know you know what I mean

3531.74 --> 3536.1
right yes sir I'm engaging in chat here

3534.42 --> 3537.9300000000003
everybody's getting really annoying I

3536.1 --> 3538.68
get it yeah yeah you gotta watch what's

3537.93 --> 3541.47
going on in there

3538.68 --> 3544.1099999999997
I should pay attention to it no no no no

3541.47 --> 3545.8799999999997
you keep on talking because otherwise we

3544.11 --> 3548.21
have silent pauses which is what usually

3545.88 --> 3552.54
happens when I get very active in chat

3548.21 --> 3555.21
what should be brought in the firmament

3552.54 --> 3556.8
as a lens and I'm like oh really so

3555.21 --> 3560.31
where's the court and it's this

3556.8 --> 3562.92
firmament I know it's a Bible but it

3560.31 --> 3565.2599999999998
doesn't mean that it's like oh it's in

3562.92 --> 3568.35
between this and that so in between

3565.26 --> 3570.8100000000004
images you got to say it makes sense

3568.35 --> 3572.64
though because because when the Sun gets

3570.81 --> 3574.74
covered by a cloud it's still daylight

3572.64 --> 3576.6299999999997
out so it has to be reflecting off

3574.74 --> 3580.0699999999997
something if all the light is coming

3576.63 --> 3584.3900000000003
from that source or light is simply

3580.07 --> 3588.75
manifesting individually to each

3584.39 --> 3590.79
position as I try to say it's just light

3588.75 --> 3593.16
manifesting from this direction to that

3590.79 --> 3595.83
direction in this specific place and

3593.16 --> 3599.5499999999997
then you go to that place over there and

3595.83 --> 3601.77
then it's manifesting similar in sort of

3599.55 --> 3607.38
the same way and yeah it's still going

3601.77 --> 3611.37
to be there same as did you see it in

3607.38 --> 3613.1400000000003
both ways sorry could you see it in both

3611.37 --> 3616.3199999999997
ways like the way you're saying and then

3613.14 --> 3622.02
also well where it's like a physical

3616.32 --> 3624.57
lake things like this if now this is

3622.02 --> 3628.29
this is yeah optics I'm gonna delve into

3624.57 --> 3630.51
a complex optic scenario and this is

3628.29 --> 3632.0299999999997
what you wanted this is what you're best

3630.51 --> 3635.94
used for I know I know

3632.03 --> 3639.8300000000004
that's right needs to focus right so

3635.94 --> 3642.84
imagine we have a limited line-of-sight

3639.83 --> 3644.85
after which refraction blurs everything

3642.84 --> 3647.7000000000003
up and you just see a soup off the

3644.85 --> 3649.29
average color of whatever is there you

3647.7 --> 3652.35
can't see any more physical objects

3649.29 --> 3657.3
because it's too far away even if it is

3652.35 --> 3660.06
extremely big okay um and then right so

3657.3 --> 3662.46
imagine that there is a very very big

3660.06 --> 3663.36
cloud that is at a surreal height

3662.46 --> 3667.98
unusual

3663.36 --> 3670.29
height that is supposedly in front of

3667.98 --> 3673.35
the Sun so that you don't see anything

3670.29 --> 3675.45
now imagine that you would in a car

3673.35 --> 3676.92
drive over a flat surface with that

3675.45 --> 3681.54
cloud in the distance in front of the

3676.92 --> 3685.4700000000003
Sun move like a mile away from the Sun

3681.54 --> 3687.7799999999997
so that suddenly that clouds which is

3685.47 --> 3691.62
huge and extremely unusually high up

3687.78 --> 3694.61
would suddenly go out side of the line

3691.62 --> 3697.7999999999997
of sight so that it will basically just

3694.61 --> 3699.8700000000003
disappear altogether I bet you you will

3697.8 --> 3702.0600000000004
suddenly start to see the Sun like if

3699.87 --> 3704.7
there was no cloud in front of it in the

3702.06 --> 3705.99
same point it would just be there you

3704.7 --> 3709.3799999999997
would no longer see the cloud even

3705.99 --> 3715.74
though you could remember and scanned it

3709.38 --> 3717.3
to be there exactly there right now it's

3715.74 --> 3721.95
kind of like how when the moon follows

3717.3 --> 3724.8300000000004
you and you're driving have you ever

3721.95 --> 3727.6499999999996
seen that yeah so but that's just it is

3724.83 --> 3730.2599999999998
it's like yeah first it when I first

3727.65 --> 3731.94
tried to put this system out there to

3730.26 --> 3733.6800000000003
seeing it like this it's like yeah it's

3731.94 --> 3735.87
almost like it's a fourth dimensional

3733.68 --> 3737.7599999999998
thing it's like we are in the third

3735.87 --> 3740.58
dimension everything that observes just

3737.76 --> 3743.67
in the fourth dimension is the center

3740.58 --> 3746.94
point of a globe of light that surrounds

3743.67 --> 3748.59
us and it follows us everywhere and it

3746.94 --> 3751.23
may change it may shift somewhat

3748.59 --> 3752.8500000000004
depending on our 3d location in the

3751.23 --> 3755.76
fourth dimension it's just always

3752.85 --> 3758.97
exactly at the edge of vision everywhere

3755.76 --> 3761.28
and that's how I try to put it down

3758.97 --> 3764.87
earlier on but that's just yeah made

3761.28 --> 3767.25
everybody's brain scramble even worse so

3764.87 --> 3769.23
but yeah that's pretty deep when you're

3767.25 --> 3772.44
talking a fourth dimension if we could

3769.23 --> 3774.87
even see it right but I'm talking just

3772.44 --> 3778.5
about another spatial approach as it

3774.87 --> 3784.0699999999997
were yeah where the 3d realm becomes

3778.5 --> 3787.11
like a sub realm to it so in the 4th

3784.07 --> 3788.9100000000003
there is absolute the center point of

3787.11 --> 3791.01
everything in the fourth dimension and

3788.91 --> 3793.47
we see these loud lights surrounding us

3791.01 --> 3795.3900000000003
always unless there is a physical thing

3793.47 --> 3796.27
obstructing it from reaching us from

3795.39 --> 3798.64
that edge of vision

3796.27 --> 3801.67
point on to us well the Sun would have

3798.64 --> 3803.16
to be the furthest thing from you then

3801.67 --> 3806.44
at all times

3803.16 --> 3807.94
sorry the Sun would have to be the

3806.44 --> 3812.05
farthest thing from you at all times

3807.94 --> 3815.41
then there's nothing beyond the Sun but

3812.05 --> 3816.57
there is the Sun doesn't exist in the

3815.41 --> 3822.1
third dimension

3816.57 --> 3824.05
it's just visually it's just visually

3822.1 --> 3826.9
there and in the fourth dimension if you

3824.05 --> 3829.3500000000004
would literally literally it then maybe

3826.9 --> 3833.4700000000003
yeah there it might be a freaking ball

3829.35 --> 3836.2599999999998
hanging there but you can never reach it

3833.47 --> 3839.23
in a third dimension you can only see it

3836.26 --> 3842.3500000000004
at the edge of your vision forever out

3839.23 --> 3845.08
of reach meaning that a fourth

3842.35 --> 3847.33
dimensional feel you know just like a

3845.08 --> 3850.54
third dimensional things are forever out

3847.33 --> 3852.7599999999998
of reach for this two dimensional things

3850.54 --> 3855.07
right yeah it does feel like that a lot

3852.76 --> 3858.0400000000004
so that's why I compared it with the

3855.07 --> 3859.51
fourth dimension conceptually like when

3858.04 --> 3861.73
you're when you're looking at the Sun

3859.51 --> 3863.71
over water or whatever it's the furthest

3861.73 --> 3867.88
thing out like there is nothing behind

3863.71 --> 3874.27
the Sun the Sun is the edge and you

3867.88 --> 3875.73
think we can't see beyond it that would

3874.27 --> 3879.52
be the start of the fourth dimension

3875.73 --> 3890.38
that's what you're saying oh sorry I got

3879.52 --> 3894.21
distracted again say again I like I like

3890.38 --> 3896.56
how it is in in Scripture though where

3894.21 --> 3898.6
it's like you know two lights in the

3896.56 --> 3903.24
firmament you know there's a lot of

3898.6 --> 3905.3199999999997
reflectors there it it seemed it seems a

3903.24 --> 3909.16
no guy was right about a lot of other

3905.32 --> 3910.9300000000003
stuff so I think that's what kind of

3909.16 --> 3912.52
where I think I don't know if it's

3910.93 --> 3914.46
physical or not but I know that there

3912.52 --> 3918.07
are two lights in the firmament you know

3914.46 --> 3921.67
well so what is the firmament you know

3918.07 --> 3925.36
it's like yeah but we think firmament

3921.67 --> 3927.91
dome firm osnome it's firm right so it

3925.36 --> 3929.829
must be dumb firm dome from I think this

3927.91 --> 3931.479
is just like yeah that's

3929.829 --> 3934.42
really nice so what's the coordinates

3931.479 --> 3936.279
please I don't think it's even necessary

3934.42 --> 3937.7690000000002
to either and if you realize that the

3936.279 --> 3942.849
lights are forever out of reach

3937.769 --> 3944.979
seemingly then maybe the firmament is in

3942.849 --> 3946.7490000000003
the fourth dimension as well maybe in

3944.979 --> 3950.3799999999997
the fourth dimension we are literally

3946.749 --> 3953.3799999999997
surrounded by a physical dome that keeps

3950.38 --> 3955.2690000000002
out water and there are lights literally

3953.38 --> 3957.19
hanging there but in the third dimension

3955.269 --> 3959.229
all of that is just out of reaching we

3957.19 --> 3963.039
are actually in a looping rectangular

3959.229 --> 3965.3799999999997
box with those fourth dimensional things

3963.039 --> 3968.759
at the edge of our vision forever how

3965.38 --> 3971.559
about that how about that as well hey I

3968.759 --> 3974.68
can see that actually but what I'm

3971.559 --> 3980.92
saying is that something is blue up

3974.68 --> 3985.45
there you know this air is clear you

3980.92 --> 3993.9
know points-- those water sunlight right

3985.45 --> 4000.029
so what is blue water so it's a color

3993.9 --> 4004.859
right water is clear - yeah so like we

4000.029 --> 4009.42
know blue water was no the water would

4004.859 --> 4012.029
be reflecting the blue firmament that's

4009.42 --> 4014.849
why the wanderer is blue on top but if

4012.029 --> 4016.859
you get a cup of water it's clear water

4014.849 --> 4022.6800000000003
only for his reflects whatever Colorado

4016.859 --> 4025.049
reflux yeah water reflects I won't I

4022.68 --> 4027.1189999999997
wouldn't go down this path blue is not

4025.049 --> 4031.469
the color of water even though we all

4027.119 --> 4033.7690000000002
like to think it is and that blue there

4031.469 --> 4036.809
is not proof that it is water up there

4033.769 --> 4039.359
no I don't think I don't think I don't

4036.809 --> 4043.529
think that I'm not saying that it is

4039.359 --> 4047.459
water right I'm saying that I'm saying

4043.529 --> 4051.289
that it is blue color right

4047.459 --> 4057.0789999999997
it is definitely blue you know and so

4051.289 --> 4060.65
air right air is is clear mostly and

4057.079 --> 4063.78
water is clear mostly so the water

4060.65 --> 4066.35
that's in our ocean that looks blue

4063.78 --> 4070.8300000000004
is really reflecting the blue roof

4066.35 --> 4073.23
because water reflects but they want you

4070.83 --> 4076.56
know I don't know this is a really light

4073.23 --> 4078.81
scattering but it only reflects blue if

4076.56 --> 4084.36
there if there's no clouds or if it's

4078.81 --> 4087.35
day yeah yeah so you know the only thing

4084.36 --> 4091.34
there is roof is the blue thing that is

4087.35 --> 4094.95
reflecting everything to be blue but no

4091.34 --> 4098.069
you know no I think it's a blue molten

4094.95 --> 4102.03
glass that's beautiful

4098.069 --> 4104.400000000001
bring me a bit earlier I was always like

4102.03 --> 4106.8589999999995
a Gillan yeah just go to the Antarctic

4104.4 --> 4108.54
bring your climbers outfit with plenty

4106.859 --> 4113.75
of clothes for the first part and then

4108.54 --> 4118.14
when you climb that glass those up there

4113.75 --> 4122.01
until it gets warm again and yeah bring

4118.14 --> 4124.200000000001
me a chip whatever I think so good bye

4122.01 --> 4126.17
you dude this is all science fiction to

4124.2 --> 4129.389999999999
me I just try to explain to you that

4126.17 --> 4133.08
although a little nature may literally

4129.39 --> 4137.76
be physical physically not here in this

4133.08 --> 4140.64
realm I said I could see really where is

4137.76 --> 4144.24
the dome where is that thing thinking

4140.64 --> 4147.96
thing where is it never ever even a hint

4144.24 --> 4149.8189999999995
at it ever well not that we like we've

4147.96 --> 4153.99
never experienced it the only place I've

4149.819 --> 4157.319
ever the best hint we got is that

4153.99 --> 4160.0199999999995
apparently some planes suppress

4157.319 --> 4165.839000000001
supposedly flew into it when they got at

4160.02 --> 4169.4400000000005
a very Antarctic South that's the

4165.839 --> 4172.609
biggest physical hint we got to a dome

4169.44 --> 4174.9
and kind of be only and the rest is all

4172.609 --> 4178.77
geometrical presuppositional base

4174.9 --> 4180.839
deductions all of it it's no freaking

4178.77 --> 4183.870000000001
proof of any physical structure out

4180.839 --> 4185.58
there well I don't think that we would

4183.87 --> 4188.339
be able to have the resources to prove

4185.58 --> 4190.5599999999995
it right but I mean if if you look in

4188.339 --> 4192.5689999999995
the Bible I mean they may explain it you

4190.56 --> 4195.81
know and like I'm confident enough with

4192.569 --> 4199.280000000001
what I read that it's a hard surface up

4195.81 --> 4202.29
there that God's throne is

4199.28 --> 4205.44
you know God like God is up there like

4202.29 --> 4207.449
I'm sure sure but yeah I need sense in

4205.44 --> 4209.3099999999995
what sense you know is that in the third

4207.449 --> 4211.889999999999
dimension or is that in the fourth

4209.31 --> 4213.51
dimension well how do I know I don't

4211.89 --> 4215.4890000000005
know what dimension it's in we can't see

4213.51 --> 4218.219
it because we're not up there but I know

4215.489 --> 4220.889999999999
that he's open to the firmament before

4218.219 --> 4225.84
to drop the flood waters the firmament

4220.89 --> 4228.21
in the third dimension you know no well

4225.84 --> 4231.03
I mean in my mind the firmament is the

4228.21 --> 4232.9800000000005
blue thing that you can see freely so

4231.03 --> 4237.66
you see it so you just assume it's all

4232.98 --> 4239.549999999999
that because you see blue well no I'm

4237.66 --> 4241.739
saying I'm saying I'm taking what I've

4239.55 --> 4243.06
read in the Bible right and in my mind

4241.739 --> 4244.919999999999
I'm saying okay well you're saying that

4243.06 --> 4247.35
there's a firmament up there God right

4244.92 --> 4250.35
so when I look up I see something blue

4247.35 --> 4256.4400000000005
so that's probably it I mean I have no

4250.35 --> 4258.570000000001
proof of that you know right that's the

4256.44 --> 4261.299999999999
best way I can say it right it doesn't

4258.57 --> 4263.67
sound very scientific you know it's not

4261.3 --> 4266.64
gonna make anyone on a lab coat happy to

4263.67 --> 4268.86
hear that well it's not really making me

4266.64 --> 4271.02
happy either because you're just another

4268.86 --> 4273.0199999999995
presuppositional route and just hanging

4271.02 --> 4275.9400000000005
on to that for no particular reason

4273.02 --> 4278.280000000001
you're just assuming it you assume that

4275.94 --> 4280.11
you understand what you read you're

4278.28 --> 4282.84
placing it in a context for which you

4280.11 --> 4284.759999999999
have no proof and then assuming it I

4282.84 --> 4288.57
sorry it's not a blasphemy or anything

4284.76 --> 4290.79
it's just was this helping I'm sorry but

4288.57 --> 4292.679
yeah I am a Cosmo genius I constantly

4290.79 --> 4295.98
test this sort of thing and somebody

4292.679 --> 4298.41
mentioned in my chatot Dracula hello by

4295.98 --> 4300.989
the way good to see you here go fast

4298.41 --> 4302.79
rocket yeah so it bumped into a thing

4300.989 --> 4304.5599999999995
right yeah sure it did and there's other

4302.79 --> 4307.92
sightings of things bumping into it

4304.56 --> 4310.650000000001
it's not a solid object though because

4307.92 --> 4312.54
when things bump into solid objects or

4310.65 --> 4315.54
flexible objects and those objects are

4312.54 --> 4317.46
not perfectly transparent but actually a

4315.54 --> 4319.199
reflective thing of some sort you would

4317.46 --> 4321.03
see ripples you would see something

4319.199 --> 4323.46
splattered against it now I'm pretty

4321.03 --> 4326.5199999999995
sure it bumped into what I'm presuming

4323.46 --> 4330.06
to be currently an energy barrier of

4326.52 --> 4334.77
some sort beyond which there

4330.06 --> 4337.620000000001
must be more air at least more air and

4334.77 --> 4339.900000000001
who knows what else is out there beyond

4337.62 --> 4342.33
might be actually some kind of physical

4339.9 --> 4345.179999999999
from an okay floor I don't know but it

4342.33 --> 4347.88
is completely out of sight and before we

4345.18 --> 4350.97
could even get hints of some kind of

4347.88 --> 4355.62
physical edge to the container you will

4350.97 --> 4356.55
bump into this energy barrier I can't

4355.62 --> 4359.61
call it anyway

4356.55 --> 4361.860000000001
and the other way that's what we got

4359.61 --> 4364.17
that's that's the physicality right

4361.86 --> 4366.42
there with no proof that I do something

4364.17 --> 4367.95
they're not now I just relieved that to

4366.42 --> 4369.87
the check because somebody brought it up

4367.95 --> 4372.57
because they saw a rocket or bump into

4369.87 --> 4375.96
something and I've seen I can agree to

4372.57 --> 4378.42
like a physical energy barrier I

4375.96 --> 4380.28
couldn't agree to that right well I know

4378.42 --> 4382.92
I know the firm it's there because God

4380.28 --> 4385.32
says up there not because I know eighter

4382.92 --> 4388.77
because I could prove it or but I know

4385.32 --> 4390.24
that there's a container up there and it

4388.77 --> 4393.0
must be because we're breathing and

4390.24 --> 4396.48
there's what I don't know the barrier is

4393.0 --> 4399.3
it I don't think it is the firmament or

4396.48 --> 4405.629999999999
the final barrier of the container

4399.3 --> 4407.04
I think the firmament is like I think

4405.63 --> 4410.01
it's in Psalms it said it was like

4407.04 --> 4414.87
molten glass I can't remember if it was

4410.01 --> 4416.85
in Psalms or not maybe Tom knows but but

4414.87 --> 4418.95
I know in Genesis they say firming it

4416.85 --> 4419.76
was hard in this it separated the waters

4418.95 --> 4421.71
from the waters

4419.76 --> 4424.77
so if I could really picture what I

4421.71 --> 4428.31
think it is I think it's a flat earth

4424.77 --> 4432.030000000001
with a dome on top and we're somehow in

4428.31 --> 4433.59
water like possibly I mean if you really

4432.03 --> 4437.639999999999
want to get far out there possibly in a

4433.59 --> 4441.51
bubble you know it with water all around

4437.64 --> 4443.1900000000005
us who knows well we can only speculate

4441.51 --> 4446.81
all that I know is that there is this

4443.19 --> 4451.339999999999
weird energy barreling and there's no

4446.81 --> 4455.1900000000005
relation or mention of this in any sorts

4451.34 --> 4458.34
in the Bible or any other ancient book

4455.19 --> 4462.33
of an literal energy barrier that is not

4458.34 --> 4462.9800000000005
a physical structure so what if I it's

4462.33 --> 4466.09
Ted

4462.98 --> 4469.37
you that this thing is recent like

4466.09 --> 4472.88
recent as in maybe a couple of hundred

4469.37 --> 4474.83
years recent this energy barrier what if

4472.88 --> 4479.66
you say this is not part of the original

4474.83 --> 4481.67
design for example maybe that things to

4479.66 --> 4483.53
prevent another flood from wiping

4481.67 --> 4485.45
everything away so they could keep

4483.53 --> 4487.639999999999
everything as is well the the rest

4485.45 --> 4489.71
outside of the energy barrier would be

4487.64 --> 4491.6900000000005
flooded for example this is heavy

4489.71 --> 4496.22
science fiction I know that's an

4491.69 --> 4498.7
interesting point right so keep in mind

4496.22 --> 4501.17
well this energy barrier really when

4498.7 --> 4504.53
where's that mention so is that a

4501.17 --> 4506.39
physical thing no is it holding up water

4504.53 --> 4508.16
is there any proof of that no it's but

4506.39 --> 4513.02
it is there why is there no mention

4508.16 --> 4516.23
whatsoever in any ancient cosmic conical

4513.02 --> 4518.330000000001
depictions or stories or there is this

4516.23 --> 4521.239
thing remember this picture is suppose

4518.33 --> 4524.78
medieval picture where they the man goes

4521.239 --> 4527.15
outside of the well these tourists are

4524.78 --> 4528.8
Bowl remember he goes physically outside

4527.15 --> 4532.19
of it he looks outside and sees like

4528.8 --> 4535.13
this weird cloudy heaven thing well is

4532.19 --> 4538.04
is that the energy barrier I don't think

4535.13 --> 4539.78
so because hey that thing that ball was

4538.04 --> 4543.05
entirely star so it's almost like the

4539.78 --> 4545.09
person went outside of it went with his

4543.05 --> 4547.85
spirit outside of his physical body

4545.09 --> 4549.5
which is at the always at the center the

4547.85 --> 4552.320000000001
globe of the heavens surrounding their

4549.5 --> 4554.57
physical sites he went outside of that

4552.32 --> 4556.73
virtual space to look basically what is

4554.57 --> 4558.53
outside of my sight I think that is

4556.73 --> 4561.11
actually what that picture represents

4558.53 --> 4565.239
not the proof of some dome or even the

4561.11 --> 4565.239
energy barrier that that may be there

4567.01 --> 4572.570000000001
I'm just saying it's it's definitely not

4569.78 --> 4574.73
out of the it's like not out of the off

4572.57 --> 4577.34
the table in a scientific way because

4574.73 --> 4579.469999999999
there isn't antecedent consequence that

4577.34 --> 4583.1
there needs to be a container right

4579.47 --> 4584.72
that's all it could be up there and must

4583.1 --> 4586.160000000001
be on there's nothing there's nothing

4584.72 --> 4588.9800000000005
that it says that it's not up there

4586.16 --> 4590.78
right and it must be comforting also but

4588.98 --> 4594.259999999999
I also can see what you're saying about

4590.78 --> 4596.37
that possibly there's been people down

4594.26 --> 4597.780000000001
here that are trying to like

4596.37 --> 4599.94
you know like you said like bought from

4597.78 --> 4603.719999999999
another flood maybe you've created some

4599.94 --> 4604.799999999999
kind of other barrier or whatever that's

4603.72 --> 4607.5
possible too

4604.8 --> 4610.110000000001
you know because I mean you see our

4607.5 --> 4614.76
technology is and there there is

4610.11 --> 4616.98
probably you know because after Genesis

4614.76 --> 4618.360000000001
six account right there's fallen angels

4616.98 --> 4621.049999999999
have been here so there at least there's

4618.36 --> 4624.69
at least that level of technology here

4621.05 --> 4627.3
who knows you know and that would be

4624.69 --> 4629.849999999999
interesting to get into is to it's

4627.3 --> 4632.7
probably not a flat earth topic but like

4629.85 --> 4636.72
like is everybody the same it's every

4632.7 --> 4638.58
person on earth the same you know or you

4636.72 --> 4642.66
know what I mean or is there some people

4638.58 --> 4647.58
with crazy powers or you know or maybe

4642.66 --> 4650.639999999999
there's still Nephilim bloodlines or are

4647.58 --> 4655.0199999999995
there angels still on earth that we

4650.64 --> 4658.26
haven't seen you know you know stuff

4655.02 --> 4660.3
like that you know because it's weird

4658.26 --> 4666.12
how not everyone reacts to like the

4660.3 --> 4669.150000000001
truth in the same way yeah Wow but you

4666.12 --> 4672.87
know how doesn't everybody do exactly

4669.15 --> 4676.679999999999
that respond in the same way just well

4672.87 --> 4679.86
no legs on what phase they are at in the

4676.68 --> 4683.070000000001
response to it what I mean by that is

4679.86 --> 4684.75
like would you say like there's people

4683.07 --> 4687.179999999999
that have known me my whole life and

4684.75 --> 4689.58
they totally trust me they know I'm a

4687.18 --> 4691.83
good good dude and I don't lie and all

4689.58 --> 4693.18
this stuff right and I try to tell them

4691.83 --> 4694.98
about the Flat Earth and they don't even

4693.18 --> 4696.75
want to hear it like I cannot possibly

4694.98 --> 4699.959999999999
be right and they don't even want to

4696.75 --> 4702.81
look into it right even though all their

4699.96 --> 4704.31
senses tell them that it I'm probably

4702.81 --> 4707.160000000001
telling the truth right

4704.31 --> 4710.85
so yeah are they responding to that that

4707.16 --> 4713.82
way because of like a long long line of

4710.85 --> 4717.360000000001
brainwashing and in it they're just they

4713.82 --> 4719.49
were affected harder than me or did the

4717.36 --> 4722.16
brainwashing not affect me as much or

4719.49 --> 4724.889999999999
are they different than me as I mean a

4722.16 --> 4729.349999999999
different type of being than me

4724.89 --> 4729.35
you know well I

4730.05 --> 4734.159000000001
you're sure that I don't know I don't

4732.21 --> 4735.9890000000005
think you can deduce them being a

4734.159 --> 4739.11
different entity from them not

4735.989 --> 4742.848999999999
responding in a constructive way because

4739.11 --> 4745.65
again people are at where they are at

4742.849 --> 4748.889
depending on where you're at and I've

4745.65 --> 4751.53
been extremely brutally rejectionist

4748.889 --> 4755.309
with like worse more aggressive

4751.53 --> 4758.19
responses than Globus even due to flat

4755.309 --> 4761.4490000000005
earth situations in my far past when

4758.19 --> 4764.75
this is not on the internet yet so yeah

4761.449 --> 4767.669999999999
you could say uh I'm a demon then

4764.75 --> 4769.949
because I responded like that or you

4767.67 --> 4772.619
could say well that guy's just can't

4769.949 --> 4776.659
freakin handle it and it just needed to

4772.619 --> 4781.32
take 30 more years how about that maybe

4776.659 --> 4784.17
yeah maybe then but that's the type of

4781.32 --> 4786.299999999999
interesting parallel right it could be

4784.17 --> 4788.52
nothing right or it could be something

4786.3 --> 4790.52
big but like at this point was how many

4788.52 --> 4794.219
lies have been told in our lives right

4790.52 --> 4796.320000000001
nothing is off the table now right even

4794.219 --> 4800.429
something as crazy as what I said is

4796.32 --> 4804.889
like somehow hmm it's not a possibility

4800.429 --> 4809.969
I think people choose to be different

4804.889 --> 4812.55
like even when you shouldn't I'd like to

4809.969 --> 4815.82
think that we're all we're all the same

4812.55 --> 4817.59
everybody is the exact same but I have a

4815.82 --> 4819.869
feeling that there's people on the earth

4817.59 --> 4821.7300000000005
they are like they have like like

4819.869 --> 4823.139
Nephilim blood they're more powerful

4821.73 --> 4827.579
they probably still have all the same

4823.139 --> 4829.469
choices and opportunities as everybody

4827.579 --> 4831.659
else to go to heaven and all that right

4829.469 --> 4837.51
but they're just having an advantage

4831.659 --> 4840.659
over us you know you know I don't know

4837.51 --> 4845.34
maybe they're smarter or stronger or you

4840.659 --> 4848.308999999999
know right but like like what do you

4845.34 --> 4851.25
think of like like okay so when the

4848.309 --> 4853.469
fallen angels came down and made it if

4851.25 --> 4855.9
the women and created enough ones right

4853.469 --> 4858.449
like all the way up till when Nimrod was

4855.9 --> 4859.46
like the king of basically the king of

4858.449 --> 4862.379999999999
the world right

4859.46 --> 4863.64
like he obviously wasn't like a regular

4862.38 --> 4869.1
human being

4863.64 --> 4870.93
you know he was like yeah a giant and

4869.1 --> 4876.21
para awesome honey wizard

4870.93 --> 4879.240000000001
yeah very smart so yeah but do you think

4876.21 --> 4881.7
it may be that it's carried on after the

4879.24 --> 4883.95
flood like maybe there are people that

4881.7 --> 4888.84
still have that bloodline of course in

4883.95 --> 4890.849999999999
the historical story very short but yeah

4888.84 --> 4894.96
of course they did there were giants

4890.85 --> 4898.08
surviving Dave crossbred with humans and

4894.96 --> 4899.94
that's still in us everywhere so I said

4898.08 --> 4901.47
the question to say that maybe there's

4899.94 --> 4904.679999999999
some people that have like all this

4901.47 --> 4905.67
power and in maybe like I don't that's

4904.68 --> 4909.06
not how it works

4905.67 --> 4911.04
oh I don't know yes it's not how it

4909.06 --> 4912.93
works it doesn't matter what you are how

4911.04 --> 4917.61
you're born if you have power of any

4912.93 --> 4921.18
kind it usually ends up having you you

4917.61 --> 4923.4
cannot be genetically predisposed to be

4921.18 --> 4926.85
able to handle corruption better if

4923.4 --> 4930.2699999999995
you're going to take the power doesn't

4926.85 --> 4934.8
work like that people with that ability

4930.27 --> 4936.92
usually are just freakin cursed em

4934.8 --> 4942.33
because you can't handle the power

4936.92 --> 4945.72
doesn't matter what you are yeah there's

4942.33 --> 4948.18
a lot of variables though I know

4945.72 --> 4950.13
interesting say I don't mean what do you

4948.18 --> 4952.38
do what do you think I think that's

4950.13 --> 4954.3
really seriously their fallen angels the

4952.38 --> 4956.43
Giants yeah

4954.3 --> 4959.97
is that really what that is is that

4956.43 --> 4964.38
really the creator who were figure and

4959.97 --> 4968.21
then rebels got down and then created

4964.38 --> 4971.04
other types of like altered humans and

4968.21 --> 4972.87
now we have the remnants of that and

4971.04 --> 4975.63
that is because of some ultimate evil

4972.87 --> 4977.58
really or were there just Giants always

4975.63 --> 4978.87
and they got caught up in this freakin

4977.58 --> 4980.76
schemes because there were a certain

4978.87 --> 4987.93
type of people group that really didn't

4980.76 --> 4990.0
like big people I mean I'm just saying

4987.93 --> 4991.71
like like some like the Genesis 6

4990.0 --> 4996.679
account and then like through Enoch and

4991.71 --> 4998.78
stuff like just that story yeah

4996.679 --> 5002.46
yeah you know the category of people

4998.78 --> 5002.46
that I'm talking about right there

5004.14 --> 5013.900000000001
inside with people in the Bible right so

5010.42 --> 5016.9
yeah let's just stop away from imagining

5013.9 --> 5019.449
the ultimate only destructive evil is

5016.9 --> 5021.73
has a physical incarnation in this world

5019.449 --> 5023.919999999999
and we have remnants in our and it must

5021.73 --> 5029.5599999999995
all be destroyed or we will all be

5023.92 --> 5034.57
destroyed what how is that sensible or

5029.56 --> 5037.179
viable or just I don't buy it anymore

5034.57 --> 5044.949
I don't buy it anything everything that

5037.179 --> 5049.6900000000005
is alive is is of God yeah there is no

5044.949 --> 5052.299999999999
second spawn doesn't exist only salmon

5049.69 --> 5054.28
spawn is just a mutilated is just the

5052.3 --> 5056.2300000000005
freakin mutilated a if you do that to

5054.28 --> 5058.54
your own kid have you thrown some freaky

5056.23 --> 5061.139999999999
designer baby yeah it might turn into a

5058.54 --> 5061.14
monster

5063.48 --> 5068.7699999999995
well if you're gonna say Nephilim

5065.969 --> 5073.06
offspring that's technical that's very

5068.77 --> 5074.92
saying then yeah yeah that's technically

5073.06 --> 5077.159000000001
what you're saying then think about the

5074.92 --> 5080.1990000000005
consequences of the words that you use

5077.159 --> 5082.57
no I'm saying the offspring of the

5080.199 --> 5085.239
Fallen Angels the obvious Oh what is

5082.57 --> 5089.34
that exactly how is that categorized in

5085.239 --> 5092.379999999999
the piece of lore you're using for that

5089.34 --> 5095.02
the Bible it's a desolate it's like a

5092.38 --> 5099.96
half angel half man yeah and and what

5095.02 --> 5106.330000000001
are they small in the bigger picture

5099.96 --> 5109.0
creature evil yes yeah why would you say

5106.33 --> 5112.33
that because they're books about it

5109.0 --> 5114.85
book of the Giants they became evil and

5112.33 --> 5117.04
hungry and it's not so nice look that's

5114.85 --> 5120.429
a crazy gnostic book though I'm talking

5117.04 --> 5122.32
about like they they described a

5120.429 --> 5125.71
Nephilim in the Giants in that process

5122.32 --> 5127.8099999999995
right but look there's okay so like

5125.71 --> 5130.18
there's the Bible and then there's books

5127.81 --> 5132.490000000001
about the Bible right so II

5130.18 --> 5134.38
during that time when when the Bible is

5132.49 --> 5136.599999999999
being written there was also Gnostic

5134.38 --> 5138.91
books being written that weren't can in

5136.6 --> 5141.04
her Scripture it was just stories that

5138.91 --> 5143.29
were written in that time that doesn't

5141.04 --> 5146.71
make them scripture equal to the Bible

5143.29 --> 5148.21
you know it's just a book that from

5146.71 --> 5151.87
their perspective what do you think it's

5148.21 --> 5154.0
just fantasy no I think that no no no I

5151.87 --> 5155.83
think they ain't why are you bringing it

5154.0 --> 5158.02
up then why are you saying no that's not

5155.83 --> 5164.85
part of the Bible so it's not important

5158.02 --> 5166.990000000001
why why not is it oh is it trying to say

5164.85 --> 5170.2300000000005
you're not listening to what I'm saying

5166.99 --> 5175.92
what I'm saying is is that if it fallen

5170.23 --> 5179.5599999999995
angel came in in in and made it was a

5175.92 --> 5182.47
human being right and then a Nephilim

5179.56 --> 5186.330000000001
was born that's a brand-new separate

5182.47 --> 5188.8
creature it has nothing to do with with

5186.33 --> 5191.47
the fallen angel yeah I was probably in

5188.8 --> 5193.570000000001
trouble you know I don't know if the

5191.47 --> 5197.02
female is complicit in that or if it was

5193.57 --> 5199.42
brutal I don't know right but I know

5197.02 --> 5201.070000000001
that that new creature whether it was

5199.42 --> 5205.42
meant to exist or not

5201.07 --> 5209.62
right is brand-new is you know it would

5205.42 --> 5214.78
be a new creature right this like any

5209.62 --> 5217.63
other new creature right sorry and so if

5214.78 --> 5220.389999999999
it's it so if it wasn't meant to exist

5217.63 --> 5224.34
or whatever then I'm sure God dealt with

5220.39 --> 5227.9800000000005
that you know but uh but it's not like

5224.34 --> 5230.8
it's not like nothing is inherently just

5227.98 --> 5233.889999999999
evil straight from birth yeah but isn't

5230.8 --> 5237.610000000001
it a break with the design it's a big

5233.89 --> 5240.76
design you gotta write his creation his

5237.61 --> 5243.04
design so if there is a break with the

5240.76 --> 5245.17
authority of the blueprint of the design

5243.04 --> 5248.86
and there's a new creature that doesn't

5245.17 --> 5251.83
abide by the design standards then what

5248.86 --> 5254.7699999999995
would come of that I don't know let's

5251.83 --> 5256.6
look to God the result right leave we

5254.77 --> 5258.490000000001
needed our resolution through Jesus

5256.6 --> 5261.400000000001
Christ to save our don't like to save

5258.49 --> 5262.269
our redeem ourselves however they get

5261.4 --> 5265.96
redeemed or

5262.269 --> 5267.820000000001
they get dull it is up to God all right

5265.96 --> 5269.65
but the redemption with Jesus Christ has

5267.82 --> 5272.92
nothing to do with the design it has to

5269.65 --> 5277.36
do with the consciousness that lives in

5272.92 --> 5279.999
the design with the souls right so it's

5277.36 --> 5282.4
not we have our own story because we're

5279.999 --> 5284.889
a certain creature in this story and

5282.4 --> 5287.499
they have their own story but I have no

5284.889 --> 5289.329
judgment on what I have no good or bad

5287.499 --> 5293.829
thought about what enough limb is I

5289.329 --> 5295.179
don't never seen one all right maybe

5293.829 --> 5297.699
there's enough one that's like a good

5295.179 --> 5299.8
dude but that doesn't mean that I know a

5297.699 --> 5301.659
lot of good dudes ran that God's gonna

5299.8 --> 5303.820000000001
deal with because they're they didn't do

5301.659 --> 5306.759999999999
the right thing or whatever then except

5303.82 --> 5309.88
to get of grace yeah they can be super

5306.76 --> 5315.639
fantastic but there's rules there's a

5309.88 --> 5317.499
book of rules right yeah they're not

5315.639 --> 5319.84
hard everyone can do it you're one of

5317.499 --> 5326.889
the choice right but again the book is

5319.84 --> 5330.099
is for the spirit it's it doesn't yeah

5326.889 --> 5332.079
it's so difficult this is a really

5330.099 --> 5334.2390000000005
difficult conversation also because

5332.079 --> 5336.099
we're both like crossing each other's

5334.239 --> 5339.329
points not really trying to make the

5336.099 --> 5342.519
same point I was originally just

5339.329 --> 5345.07
objecting to the idea of of Nephilim and

5342.519 --> 5347.019
that their offspring because when you do

5345.07 --> 5348.07
that it's like oh that that's a remnant

5347.019 --> 5350.019
of evil

5348.07 --> 5352.539
that's like a something I broke with the

5350.019 --> 5354.579000000001
design now but they're freaking hordes

5352.539 --> 5357.219
of people out there there used to be at

5354.579 --> 5361.9
least that think like that

5357.219 --> 5364.869
okay yeah yeah this is part of the devil

5361.9 --> 5368.888999999999
persecution side [ __ ]

5364.869 --> 5372.989
it also comes yeah I think I think

5368.889 --> 5376.7390000000005
hating on hating on anyone unfairly is

5372.989 --> 5379.629999999999
not really justified for anybody but

5376.739 --> 5385.718999999999
that's not for me to deal with her

5379.63 --> 5389.04
decide you know yeah I would be against

5385.719 --> 5391.37
anyone hating any kind of creature

5389.04 --> 5395.28
[Music]

5391.37 --> 5398.58
yeah it's a good thing we're not the

5395.28 --> 5400.98
boss of the world right is it it would

5398.58 --> 5406.68
make this movie oh it make us crazy man

5400.98 --> 5408.839999999999
have to deal with everybody is that God

5406.68 --> 5416.31
has the hardest job of all right he's

5408.84 --> 5419.91
gonna make this whole thing run he's got

5416.31 --> 5421.77
the hardest job I think it would only be

5419.91 --> 5425.48
considered a hard job from the

5421.77 --> 5430.2300000000005
perspective of a puny human that is

5425.48 --> 5434.04
bound by the physical restraints of 3d

5430.23 --> 5436.65
existence so I know I wouldn't yeah I

5434.04 --> 5438.99
don't know I think it's much more

5436.65 --> 5442.139999999999
difficult to attain the wisdom required

5438.99 --> 5444.03
to have a good proper oversight off the

5442.14 --> 5449.88
results of everything rather than it is

5444.03 --> 5453.15
to just be a manager but right and when

5449.88 --> 5456.6
it comes to wisdom yeah the Creator must

5453.15 --> 5458.58
have you know it's even it's even hard

5456.6 --> 5461.52
for me to do the right thing on a day to

5458.58 --> 5465.12
day basis you know I have enough issues

5461.52 --> 5469.13
with my own spirit and and how I feel

5465.12 --> 5471.96
about my my own mistakes in my own

5469.13 --> 5475.91
corruption you know that I have to deal

5471.96 --> 5480.69
with you know then to be worrying about

5475.91 --> 5485.49
you know what you know you know what I'm

5480.69 --> 5488.07
saying right now look yeah it's not for

5485.49 --> 5498.24
me to say anybody's inherently evil from

5488.07 --> 5501.509999999999
the beginning no no I am yeah well I

5498.24 --> 5504.21
don't know but we got a savior right and

5501.51 --> 5507.3
we have a choice of what is here you

5504.21 --> 5510.15
know is evil is that I think that evil

5507.3 --> 5515.16
is purely based in in decision making

5510.15 --> 5519.0
and in well I know this if we accept if

5515.16 --> 5522.36
we accept the grace of sacrifice of

5519.0 --> 5523.87
Jesus Christ right when we when we die

5522.36 --> 5525.4
and leave this body we

5523.87 --> 5529.15
you're gonna get an incorruptible body

5525.4 --> 5531.7
that won't ever be able to do evil you

5529.15 --> 5534.96
know and to me that sounds like a good

5531.7 --> 5537.55
deal and I'm pretty grateful for that

5534.96 --> 5540.01
well we'll see what we'll get there

5537.55 --> 5541.78
because from this perspective that sure

5540.01 --> 5545.02
doesn't seem to make any kind of point

5541.78 --> 5547.75
to me because what like if God created

5545.02 --> 5550.06
everything to experience and all that

5547.75 --> 5552.43
then that is like the ultimate good then

5550.06 --> 5556.18
what would a incur up corruptible

5552.43 --> 5558.1900000000005
existence separated what would that even

5556.18 --> 5561.280000000001
show to you if everything is already

5558.19 --> 5563.0199999999995
perfect you know what is there to do if

5561.28 --> 5565.66
everything is perfect except

5563.02 --> 5567.34
imperfection isn't creation itself

5565.66 --> 5571.0599999999995
basically a form of controlled

5567.34 --> 5575.32
imperfection in order to seek new depths

5571.06 --> 5577.660000000001
I don't know I just know that like I

5575.32 --> 5579.82
know that from the beginning it felt

5577.66 --> 5581.23
like the third page or something right

5579.82 --> 5584.32
you're reading the Bible and you're like

5581.23 --> 5586.69
oh Adam ate that fruit you know wasn't

5584.32 --> 5597.16
supposed to eat it and so from the very

5586.69 --> 5598.78
beginning we knew - perspective now I

5597.16 --> 5606.97
imagine that he wouldn't have done it

5598.78 --> 5609.28
that was that you know my rules are what

5606.97 --> 5611.9800000000005
they need to do you know I just I want

5609.28 --> 5614.2
to do the thing that God says all right

5611.98 --> 5616.69
and so it's not like some big surprise

5614.2 --> 5620.29
that this world is corrupted you know

5616.69 --> 5623.379999999999
but there is a solution if you want it

5620.29 --> 5625.7699999999995
you know or we can get caught up in this

5623.38 --> 5628.66
life thinking that this is everything

5625.77 --> 5632.410000000001
which this is just gonna be a small

5628.66 --> 5634.48
small small section of a life that's

5632.41 --> 5638.29
eternal I mean a billion years is gonna

5634.48 --> 5640.99
be nothing to us you know so 70 80 years

5638.29 --> 5643.69
that's nothing it's not about the time

5640.99 --> 5645.429999999999
it's about the change and that's what

5643.69 --> 5648.28
you realize when you become timeless

5645.43 --> 5652.27
time itself there's nothing it is change

5648.28 --> 5654.55
that actually matters and there is a

5652.27 --> 5656.330000000001
billion years and there's literally

5654.55 --> 5659.06
nothing changed then it is literal

5656.33 --> 5661.01
nothing to the timeless experience but

5659.06 --> 5662.84
if there is a billion years of constant

5661.01 --> 5663.85
change then there will be nothing left

5662.84 --> 5667.31
of you

5663.85 --> 5668.870000000001
no he says it's gonna be good he says he

5667.31 --> 5670.700000000001
doesn't know how the words to say how

5668.87 --> 5674.72
good it's gonna be all right well I'll

5670.7 --> 5676.91
go with that that would be great don't

5674.72 --> 5679.070000000001
you want to imagine it you know it's

5676.91 --> 5681.17
already difficult enough just to focus

5679.07 --> 5683.45
on this freaking world right here right

5681.17 --> 5686.18
now and then just imagining like the

5683.45 --> 5686.69
unlimited joy of once you're gone or

5686.18 --> 5688.280000000001
something

5686.69 --> 5691.219999999999
for [ __ ] sake I'm already having

5688.28 --> 5694.13
enough trouble staying right here right

5691.22 --> 5697.31
now Thanks what I would never good news

5694.13 --> 5699.2
I wouldn't be like oh you know what I'm

5697.31 --> 5701.51
just gonna chill right now because I

5699.2 --> 5703.49
know that everything is cool later well

5701.51 --> 5705.650000000001
it's the good news in the sense that I

5703.49 --> 5707.96
don't have to have like this permanent

5705.65 --> 5710.2699999999995
frenzied panic of once I'm going to die

5707.96 --> 5714.31
everything's over but I didn't have that

5710.27 --> 5717.77
for a long a long time if ever was but

5714.31 --> 5720.43
that was even before well Christ

5717.77 --> 5725.030000000001
it's just that yeah a lot of [ __ ] then

5720.43 --> 5727.43
basically I got indoctrinated with and

5725.03 --> 5731.69
that haunted me but it was always

5727.43 --> 5733.610000000001
delusion and just you don't understand

5731.69 --> 5737.33
it like this world lies to us man and

5733.61 --> 5739.82
tells us all kinds of stuff that you

5737.33 --> 5742.19
know it's that it's simple it's very

5739.82 --> 5744.94
simple this world got jacked up and

5742.19 --> 5749.8099999999995
we're gonna get we got saved out of it

5744.94 --> 5754.58
you know all right I don't know if that

5749.81 --> 5756.56
means but that's fine I think I'm gonna

5754.58 --> 5761.12
round out the show I think um for all

5756.56 --> 5763.700000000001
right when I have hours yeah yeah it was

5761.12 --> 5765.59
great totally know where you got a bit

5763.7 --> 5767.54
bit of friction though you know because

5765.59 --> 5772.91
sometimes I do kind of want to slap you

5767.54 --> 5777.17
around this is like this is not the

5772.91 --> 5779.87
right time to be a goody two-shoe like

5777.17 --> 5782.75
sometimes you just need to put the candy

5779.87 --> 5786.44
back in the box and pick up the freaking

5782.75 --> 5788.51
sword already know and sometimes you

5786.44 --> 5789.549999999999
need to just be careful what you take

5788.51 --> 5792.64
out of that box

5789.55 --> 5796.27
show everyone because there's just much

5792.64 --> 5797.650000000001
broader context to a lot of things you

5796.27 --> 5801.55
know there's a lot of people out there

5797.65 --> 5804.15
that just yeah anyway I made the coin

5801.55 --> 5807.1
during the show lowriders I'm not gonna

5804.15 --> 5810.58
not gonna grill you over then again hey

5807.1 --> 5813.22
it was a good show and no I get a bit I

5810.58 --> 5814.84
get a bit rough sometimes that's how

5813.22 --> 5816.67
that's how we learn that's how I learned

5814.84 --> 5819.03
that's how everyone learns man we got to

5816.67 --> 5821.49
get a little uncomfortable sometimes

5819.03 --> 5825.3099999999995
right

5821.49 --> 5829.0599999999995
but yeah be careful with the with the

5825.31 --> 5830.68
stomach situation and like if there's

5829.06 --> 5833.110000000001
something that's just gonna keep on

5830.68 --> 5837.04
building the amounts of stuff you intake

5833.11 --> 5839.23
you must break away from that no matter

5837.04 --> 5843.88
what because it is literally like a time

5839.23 --> 5847.419999999999
bomb that's great away from it yeah

5843.88 --> 5850.150000000001
somehow I'm gonna buy that apple vinegar

5847.42 --> 5853.57
today to cut the cloudy's the cloudy one

5850.15 --> 5855.61
right be very careful though don't take

5853.57 --> 5861.299999999999
it we're already in the middle of like

5855.61 --> 5865.03
an attack yeah do it before okay
