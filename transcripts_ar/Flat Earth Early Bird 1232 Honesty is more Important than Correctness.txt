it's like yeah it's a lot of moist in

136.959 --> 141.599
the air i think

138.319 --> 143.11999999999998
and it yeah it is still kind of warm

141.599 --> 145.76
clouded

143.12 --> 149.52
kind of misty what the

145.76 --> 152.239
hell that just came walking in hello

176.45 --> 182.39999999999998
[Music]

179.2 --> 182.39999999999998
but i'm think i'm all right

183.36 --> 188.4
i do have a lot of energy but i did yeah

185.519 --> 191.36
it seemed to had a bit of a rough night

188.4 --> 195.92000000000002
then i kind of noticed like hey wait

191.36 --> 195.92000000000002
where is my issues this is like

196.84 --> 201.76
nothing like it was never there almost

199.44 --> 203.84
but yeah there's still some

201.76 --> 205.599
things

203.84 --> 209.76
but yeah it's just regeneration

205.599 --> 209.76
sometimes gets me a rough night okay

235.439 --> 240.599
i just watched a amazing video

241.599 --> 246.159
assembled by owen benjamin and team and

244.72 --> 249.519
bears

246.159 --> 249.519
my laugh my choice

249.92 --> 254.48
it's

251.28 --> 257.919
i just love it

254.48 --> 260.0
so yeah i gotta share that

257.919 --> 263.03999999999996
i might call my show that

260.0 --> 263.04
title but

263.199 --> 267.28000000000003
i don't know yet depends on what's gonna

265.44 --> 269.84
happen

267.28 --> 272.63899999999995
but yeah amazing

269.84 --> 272.63899999999995
it really

274.72 --> 279.84000000000003
condenses a moment together like of

277.6 --> 280.639
what's been happening and connecting it

279.84 --> 283.11999999999995
to

280.639 --> 286.08
comedy it's like a

283.12 --> 286.08
how do you call that

290.56 --> 295.52
it's really like almost comedy taking a

293.36 --> 299.12
religious stand

295.52 --> 301.12
through grassroots it's it's amazing

299.12 --> 303.52
it definitely

301.12 --> 307.28000000000003
nominated as far as i'm concerned to be

303.52 --> 310.52
the funniest video of 2022

307.28 --> 310.52
in general

310.639 --> 313.6
so enjoy that

315.039 --> 317.84
in your own time

318.08 --> 322.56
it's like a little less than 10 minutes

322.96 --> 325.84
right

332.88 --> 340.08
and yeah the video is really about

336.72 --> 343.03900000000004
owen benjamin's style of comedy

340.08 --> 344.24
and how he basically just reminds

343.039 --> 348.32
everybody

344.24 --> 350.479
of really silly things that happened to

348.32 --> 352.32
their group

350.479 --> 354.24
their ancestry

352.32 --> 358.24
all these things right

354.24 --> 359.44
and it is funny and it is interesting

358.24 --> 362.0
it's like

359.44 --> 363.12
weird history

362.0 --> 365.28
in a way

363.12 --> 367.759
because yeah when with these types of

365.28 --> 370.15999999999997
things he always grabs something that is

367.759 --> 370.16
real

370.88 --> 376.71999999999997
like embarrassing things people don't

372.88 --> 376.71999999999997
like to be reminded about in general

379.12 --> 383.889
i loved it

380.73 --> 383.889
[Music]

390.4 --> 394.46
anyway how are you guys doing uh sun's

392.8 --> 396.479
coming through

394.46 --> 397.68
[Music]

396.479 --> 401.68
right yeah

397.68 --> 401.68
no flat earth debate again yesterday

406.8 --> 410.40000000000003
i hope there will be one today

419.039 --> 422.039
hello

422.4 --> 425.35999999999996
heaven above

427.08 --> 430.96
terror306 light hello

431.759 --> 435.039
there is a live

435.599 --> 439.199
what do you mean terry 306

449.199 --> 454.16
right let me check the temperature etc

458.24 --> 465.639
16 degrees

461.36 --> 465.639
64 humidity

466.479 --> 468.8
okay

469.75 --> 474.479
[Music]

472.56 --> 479.44
apparently there is some

474.479 --> 480.639
precipitation so there is some rain

479.44 --> 482.71999999999997
little

480.639 --> 485.72
or maybe like

482.72 --> 485.72
again

496.879 --> 500.44
let me go

511.599 --> 514.8
oh my god

512.959 --> 516.8
gravitational pull

514.8 --> 519.519
i looked up precipitation and the first

516.8 --> 521.8389999999999
thing is like oh the meteorology

519.519 --> 521.839
you know

523.2 --> 530.1600000000001
any product of condensation i thought it

526.72 --> 532.72
was conversation just some yeah a little

530.16 --> 536.56
slow today

532.72 --> 539.36
but then under atmospheric water vapor

536.56 --> 542.399
that falls under gravitational pull from

539.36 --> 544.72
clouds this is okay

542.399 --> 544.72
right

545.04 --> 548.36
it's everywhere

550.959 --> 555.68
right but condensation

553.76 --> 559.12
basically a lot of moist in the air so

555.68 --> 562.7199999999999
precipitation would then

559.12 --> 565.92
be a sign there is water evaporation

562.72 --> 565.9200000000001
or condensation or

567.2 --> 573.0400000000001
well if the process is there there would

569.12 --> 573.04
have to be a lot of moist in the air

573.279 --> 577.8389999999999
right anyway a max of niche

589.54 --> 592.5999999999999
[Music]

596.24 --> 599.24
right

604.399 --> 607.519
yeah jim bob had it

607.6 --> 612.8000000000001
more interesting streams he just keeps

610.0 --> 614.88
going he's reviewing his own streams now

612.8 --> 616.56
by the way

614.88 --> 619.12
he's

616.56 --> 621.3599999999999
reviewing his own

619.12 --> 624.24
like he's bringing building a brenda

621.36 --> 626.8000000000001
lore and he's doing it like publicly

624.24 --> 626.8
it's funny

629.279 --> 633.8389999999999
all right it's funny to see him do it

631.04 --> 636.7199999999999
like i've sort of done that

633.839 --> 641.1600000000001
in my own time

636.72 --> 641.1600000000001
he's really making work of it

650.24 --> 654.24
right yeah that was a bit vacant

654.399 --> 657.399
youtube

659.56 --> 662.75
[Music]

666.16 --> 669.56
is doing

681.04 --> 685.04
i think i've just been like yeah i've

682.959 --> 686.88
been eating a lot

685.04 --> 687.5999999999999
that might have also something to do

686.88 --> 689.6
with

687.6 --> 692.64
having a bit more rough sleep i

689.6 --> 695.519
basically did eat a lot

692.64 --> 697.6
oh but it was so good

695.519 --> 700.5600000000001
and it hit the spot but

697.6 --> 704.64
made my night a little rough too

700.56 --> 706.7199999999999
like with all the precipitation

704.64 --> 706.72
in

714.839 --> 720.1600000000001
here i did not watch my own show no i

717.839 --> 724.6800000000001
did watch my show back and i still

720.16 --> 724.68
couldn't figure out a title for it

733.04 --> 737.12
i did notice

734.88 --> 737.12
like

739.44 --> 743.6
i'm noticing signs like from my own

741.68 --> 745.68
perspective of like

743.6 --> 748.8000000000001
slight cohesion drop

745.68 --> 751.3599999999999
so i might be over my peak

748.8 --> 753.12
with like the energy that's been coming

751.36 --> 755.76
out but i might be wrong about it might

753.12 --> 759.12
also be just the weather changes and

755.76 --> 762.72
i don't know exactly

759.12 --> 762.72
but yeah i didn't like all of it

763.92 --> 770.4399999999999
especially like when i get pissed off i

766.0 --> 770.44
really need to be careful with the mic

772.0 --> 777.6
and not be so eager to

774.72 --> 777.6
roll into that

783.2 --> 787.72
hey seeking star wars bladder sage

798.21 --> 801.4290000000001
[Music]

803.6 --> 806.6
ah

816.959 --> 821.3599999999999
right yeah i have nothing but tea here

822.56 --> 827.68
but i'm just kind of taking it easy i'm

824.399 --> 830.24
just weird it's i still feel full from

827.68 --> 830.2399999999999
yesterday

835.85 --> 840.9590000000001
[Music]

838.48 --> 843.12
maybe my metabolism kind of slowed down

840.959 --> 846.2399999999999
for some reason a bit

843.12 --> 846.24
i wonder why that would be

847.36 --> 853.6800000000001
taking a pause

850.24 --> 856.5600000000001
or perhaps yeah weather change

853.68 --> 860.8
yeah okay i think i pretty much know now

856.56 --> 860.8
what's going on from all the angles

861.44 --> 869.839
anyway i think i'll be perfectly fine

864.399 --> 869.839
but yeah new moon oh all right well

872.24 --> 876.88
i'll subject it to the cycles one way or

874.639 --> 878.88
another

876.88 --> 881.4399999999999
and the more you do your best to really

878.88 --> 883.76
do that even on your own personal skill

881.44 --> 886.639
you'll find yourself starting to attune

883.76 --> 888.16
to like astrological cycle related

886.639 --> 890.8
things so yeah

888.16 --> 890.8
just happens

893.839 --> 899.0400000000001
right but i am kind of a bit of a blank

896.0 --> 900.959
slate really

899.04 --> 903.04
not very eager

900.959 --> 905.279
right now

903.04 --> 908.0
to really like

905.279 --> 910.8
talk about this or that

908.0 --> 913.68
but i might very like there's kindle

910.8 --> 916.079
here so you might be able to spark my

913.68 --> 916.079
interest

920.88 --> 924.399
because i don't know exactly how much

923.04 --> 927.4399999999999
energy i have

924.399 --> 930.0
but i know that i can reach very deep

927.44 --> 930.8000000000001
with my inside

930.0 --> 932.8
like

930.8 --> 934.959
in the last couple of days it's like

932.8 --> 938.0
it's almost like it keeps on building

934.959 --> 940.399
i'm not sure it's like

938.0 --> 942.16
i'm starting to lose like grip on how to

940.399 --> 944.32
even catalog

942.16 --> 945.88
properly and honestly what's happening

944.32 --> 948.8000000000001
because

945.88 --> 950.48
[Music]

948.8 --> 952.639
yeah

950.48 --> 954.639
watching myself sometimes gets a bit

952.639 --> 957.12
surreal

954.639 --> 958.8
especially when i go like really in

957.12 --> 963.519
detail

958.8 --> 966.4799999999999
and it it it feels like literally i am

963.519 --> 969.519
me from there talking to myself then and

966.48 --> 971.1990000000001
that gets like

969.519 --> 974.24
surreal

971.199 --> 976.4799999999999
it almost gives a weird

974.24 --> 979.6800000000001
spark like

976.48 --> 982.24
there's somebody else like me out there

979.68 --> 983.3599999999999
but in this case that's like so it might

982.24 --> 985.12
be

983.36 --> 986.5600000000001
i might be

985.12 --> 988.639
i'm gonna have to be a little bit more

986.56 --> 993.04
careful watching my own shows back there

988.639 --> 993.04
might be a weird like meta

995.519 --> 1001.04
it's not inward spiral it's more like a

998.16 --> 1003.199
a fractal trap happening

1001.04 --> 1005.4399999999999
mirror image of myself effect that's

1003.199 --> 1008.4799999999999
having weird side effects or something

1005.44 --> 1012.8000000000001
but it is still very much worth studying

1008.48 --> 1012.8000000000001
and also yeah quality control

1012.88 --> 1019.04
right

1014.399 --> 1019.04
i do try to perform quality control

1019.279 --> 1022.0
on myself

1022.079 --> 1026.3999999999999
because i can sleep and then people

1024.48 --> 1028.319
sleep all the time right i watch a lot

1026.4 --> 1030.959
of media because i barely have a life

1028.319 --> 1030.959
except for this

1031.839 --> 1037.76
and yes over time people have faces

1035.199 --> 1040.64
where they start to slip

1037.76 --> 1044.24
start to jump mumble up right

1040.64 --> 1045.8390000000002
now if you then normalize that

1044.24 --> 1048.319
that could have

1045.839 --> 1051.6
that could be like leaving around the

1048.319 --> 1053.6789999999999
lego blocks on the floor

1051.6 --> 1054.8799999999999
when you have a habit of walking around

1053.679 --> 1056.4
bare feet

1054.88 --> 1059.6000000000001
right

1056.4 --> 1061.52
you're gonna like mess up and it's gonna

1059.6 --> 1063.76
like ruin moments

1061.52 --> 1063.76
so

1064.4 --> 1069.8400000000001
try to naturally be very careful about

1066.88 --> 1069.8400000000001
that for myself

1070.24 --> 1075.36
but still sometimes i don't notice it

1073.12 --> 1075.36
so

1075.76 --> 1080.16
and then it like really slips my

1077.44 --> 1081.8400000000001
attention because i kind of like i

1080.16 --> 1085.2
didn't know even the mistake was

1081.84 --> 1085.1999999999998
happening but like auto

1085.6 --> 1090.08
using

1087.2 --> 1092.24
the mistake type of moment to

1090.08 --> 1095.1999999999998
paint out of it perfectly so that you

1092.24 --> 1096.559
don't notice but then i forget that it

1095.2 --> 1098.24
happened

1096.559 --> 1100.0
but that's good in a way in the moment

1098.24 --> 1103.039
because then i stay in the flow and it

1100.0 --> 1104.72
doesn't distract me right it's but

1103.039 --> 1107.039
weird to see that

1104.72 --> 1107.039
back

1107.2 --> 1111.1200000000001
uh this is i'm sorry i'm i'm kind of

1109.76 --> 1114.16
like

1111.12 --> 1118.08
meta spiraling about my own activity now

1114.16 --> 1121.559
it's this might get a little tedious

1118.08 --> 1121.559
i am sorry

1123.2 --> 1128.96
or maybe a whole bunch of you like

1125.039 --> 1128.96
really like that i do that i don't know

1129.12 --> 1133.6399999999999
i'm not i'm not entirely sure

1148.16 --> 1151.16
right

1161.039 --> 1165.919
just be yourself yeah but it's gonna be

1164.0 --> 1167.6
more weird

1165.919 --> 1171.3600000000001
inward

1167.6 --> 1172.48
analysis and like oh this is

1171.36 --> 1175.36
how

1172.48 --> 1177.3600000000001
suddenly your rose color darkly changes

1175.36 --> 1179.36
because it's yourself

1177.36 --> 1181.6
watching yourself from another time

1179.36 --> 1184.32
perspective

1181.6 --> 1186.48
and not having prejudice about it

1184.32 --> 1189.9189999999999
and then yeah you do kind of get a weird

1186.48 --> 1189.919
feedback loop with yourself

1190.48 --> 1192.4
it's

1191.36 --> 1194.7199999999998
very weird

1192.4 --> 1197.679
especially because

1194.72 --> 1201.039
when i do my shows

1197.679 --> 1201.039
i account for that

1201.2 --> 1205.76
i know i'm going to be watching back

1203.679 --> 1208.64
myself sometimes

1205.76 --> 1212.24
i anticipate for that

1208.64 --> 1213.5200000000002
and i come up like when i do things i

1212.24 --> 1216.159
come up with

1213.52 --> 1218.48
like confrontational ideas

1216.159 --> 1221.6000000000001
that when i'm just alone right i'm just

1218.48 --> 1223.52
alone watching media making dinner maybe

1221.6 --> 1226.32
having some basic banter about the

1223.52 --> 1229.039
weather or something i do that

1226.32 --> 1230.3999999999999
i don't come up with those ideas

1229.039 --> 1233.52
i don't come up with those

1230.4 --> 1236.799
confrontational ideas i instead

1233.52 --> 1236.799
do dreamwalking and

1236.96 --> 1243.1200000000001
focus on generalized patterns like on

1240.4 --> 1245.52
the weave of it all

1243.12 --> 1247.52
so i i don't typically then focus on

1245.52 --> 1251.12
myself i dream away

1247.52 --> 1254.8799999999999
but when i do the show i have a function

1251.12 --> 1257.28
like a teacher to be confrontational

1254.88 --> 1260.2800000000002
and it's then really odd but it works on

1257.28 --> 1260.28
yourself

1263.44 --> 1266.4
but also

1266.48 --> 1272.88
when i started to notice that effect

1268.799 --> 1276.96
happening i also noticed like yeah

1272.88 --> 1280.4
i might be a little unreasonable

1276.96 --> 1280.4
too caught up in the moment

1280.64 --> 1283.6000000000001
so that it

1282.24 --> 1285.919
yes it is a

1283.6 --> 1288.6399999999999
expression

1285.919 --> 1291.3600000000001
but it's very unlikely that people will

1288.64 --> 1292.24
take it seriously other than okay that's

1291.36 --> 1294.9599999999998
what

1292.24 --> 1297.039
would naturally happen yes

1294.96 --> 1297.8400000000001
if you let go

1297.039 --> 1300.96
and

1297.84 --> 1302.32
hopefully i'll get even like

1300.96 --> 1305.52
side

1302.32 --> 1307.52
ideas or compliments like yeah for a guy

1305.52 --> 1309.76
that is effectively out of control he

1307.52 --> 1311.84
seemed he's pretty much under control

1309.76 --> 1313.76
compared to when it happens to other

1311.84 --> 1316.559
people

1313.76 --> 1318.72
because then people on average tend to

1316.559 --> 1321.6
like really lose it

1318.72 --> 1323.76
when they get angry

1321.6 --> 1324.8799999999999
so they don't

1323.76 --> 1326.72
learn

1324.88 --> 1328.88
to deal with it to harness it to

1326.72 --> 1330.88
actually utilize it and retain their

1328.88 --> 1333.2
consciousness

1330.88 --> 1335.5200000000002
and i have learned to do that

1333.2 --> 1336.48
very early on because i had a lot of

1335.52 --> 1339.52
like

1336.48 --> 1341.52
heavy impulsive reactions like very

1339.52 --> 1344.72
impulsive

1341.52 --> 1346.6399999999999
and in that was aggression and

1344.72 --> 1348.559
like they've tried to condition it out

1346.64 --> 1350.0
of me

1348.559 --> 1353.039
i have but

1350.0 --> 1355.2
like it only resulted in like

1353.039 --> 1358.64
like no you can't

1355.2 --> 1358.64
you're not allowed to do that

1358.72 --> 1363.84
like you need this

1360.72 --> 1366.24
you just need to learn to deal with it

1363.84 --> 1368.8799999999999
so when i noticed that like i wouldn't

1366.24 --> 1368.88
surrender

1369.679 --> 1375.8400000000001
i just tried to like okay just

1372.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
sorry for

1375.919 --> 1380.88
ruffling your feathers i just i had

1378.24 --> 1382.64
squirt i wouldn't say that but

1380.88 --> 1383.5200000000002
that's how it would be understood now i

1382.64 --> 1385.2
just

1383.52 --> 1387.28
had to say it right

1385.2 --> 1388.559
like sometimes people do that in chat

1387.28 --> 1390.48
well i

1388.559 --> 1394.24
didn't have chat

1390.48 --> 1397.1200000000001
in my youth that didn't exist

1394.24 --> 1401.48
like msn like chat communication that

1397.12 --> 1401.4799999999998
kind of came like around

1402.159 --> 1406.96
when i was 17. i think that's when i

1404.559 --> 1409.52
first started doing that

1406.96 --> 1414.52
but before that time i did that sort of

1409.52 --> 1414.52
thing in just i just like hey people

1416.559 --> 1421.9189999999999
be arwenian

1418.72 --> 1423.919
but very young and

1421.919 --> 1425.3600000000001
like more arrogant

1423.919 --> 1428.8400000000001
but like

1425.36 --> 1432.1589999999999
arrogant like not arrogant

1428.84 --> 1434.8799999999999
it's really thinking you're all that

1432.159 --> 1437.6000000000001
without actually having

1434.88 --> 1440.0800000000002
proof for that yet

1437.6 --> 1440.08
i don't know

1441.6 --> 1445.12
and

1442.48 --> 1448.799
those moments were just like they are

1445.12 --> 1451.84
now although it's less extreme

1448.799 --> 1454.559
followed up by periods where i was like

1451.84 --> 1457.52
really timid and like i just had no

1454.559 --> 1460.24
confidence i couldn't face anything

1457.52 --> 1463.12
it was really sad

1460.24 --> 1464.159
i had that as well

1463.12 --> 1466.799
and that

1464.159 --> 1469.44
does ruin your social life like

1466.799 --> 1469.44
completely

1469.76 --> 1471.679
but

1470.88 --> 1474.159
then

1471.679 --> 1476.88
eventually at some point

1474.159 --> 1480.3200000000002
spark would light me up again and i'd i

1476.88 --> 1482.159
suddenly find my humor back and

1480.32 --> 1483.6
and then suddenly again in everybody's

1482.159 --> 1485.44
face again

1483.6 --> 1486.9599999999998
right

1485.44 --> 1489.1200000000001
well they thought

1486.96 --> 1491.679
so i sort of got designated like that

1489.12 --> 1493.6789999999999
like oh you're like manic depressive and

1491.679 --> 1496.0800000000002
you're hyperactive

1493.679 --> 1498.72
okay

1496.08 --> 1502.08
if that's what that is

1498.72 --> 1504.799
but yeah i have not like oh i'm going to

1502.08 --> 1507.76
look into that and know everything about

1504.799 --> 1512.24
it and then i have to adapt to that so

1507.76 --> 1514.72
that it can be understood like no no

1512.24 --> 1517.039
it's just an observation to me it's just

1514.72 --> 1519.1200000000001
like and

1517.039 --> 1521.279
that will be a cross-reference out there

1519.12 --> 1523.36
of how what people can

1521.279 --> 1525.039
like compare it to

1523.36 --> 1527.6789999999999
and then they yeah they might have like

1525.039 --> 1529.279
a limited understanding like a limited

1527.679 --> 1531.919
framework understanding a rough

1529.279 --> 1531.919
understanding

1532.08 --> 1537.52
that

1533.52 --> 1539.52
will not make me as alien to them

1537.52 --> 1541.44
right

1539.52 --> 1544.4
so that's

1541.44 --> 1544.4
i would help with that

1547.2 --> 1552.559
look dude i would've been i've been like

1549.2 --> 1555.52
fractal planning fractal thinking since

1552.559 --> 1557.84
my teens and like

1555.52 --> 1562.1589999999999
i couldn't turn it off

1557.84 --> 1562.1589999999999
like once that started up it's like

1562.799 --> 1567.52
like now it unnerves me like

1565.36 --> 1569.279
i didn't fully understand yet well i did

1567.52 --> 1570.6399999999999
in a way i did feel like there's

1569.279 --> 1573.12
something wrong about doing that but

1570.64 --> 1575.3600000000001
it's like i'm a god

1573.12 --> 1578.2399999999998
right i have so much i have this

1575.36 --> 1580.4799999999998
magnificent thing

1578.24 --> 1582.159
that's part of that that is

1580.48 --> 1584.4
like me

1582.159 --> 1587.679
what i can do with me

1584.4 --> 1590.88
and i want to be good

1587.679 --> 1593.919
but i have problems understanding

1590.88 --> 1596.3200000000002
like how things work and that like what

1593.919 --> 1599.3600000000001
you just want isn't exactly how it

1596.32 --> 1602.8799999999999
really works that there's this

1599.36 --> 1604.799
almost natural cognitive dissonance

1602.88 --> 1607.0390000000002
between what people dwell on in their

1604.799 --> 1609.9189999999999
minds and what really happens and that's

1607.039 --> 1612.64
been like a massive

1609.919 --> 1613.76
massive challenge right because

1612.64 --> 1617.2
yeah

1613.76 --> 1619.76
the fractal implications are

1617.2 --> 1622.48
all-encompassing

1619.76 --> 1624.72
it almost all becomes about that and

1622.48 --> 1627.1200000000001
about trying to clarify that that that's

1624.72 --> 1630.48
part of what i do

1627.12 --> 1634.799
so that you can master

1630.48 --> 1637.039
your consciousness while you engage with

1634.799 --> 1639.52
the real world the physical real

1637.039 --> 1642.24
experience based memories

1639.52 --> 1645.76
and the inner world where yeah

1642.24 --> 1647.279
technically you can let yourself go

1645.76 --> 1648.0
but that's gonna

1647.279 --> 1650.72
like

1648.0 --> 1652.96
deepen the rift it's gonna make your

1650.72 --> 1654.64
inner world and the outer world alien to

1652.96 --> 1658.32
one another

1654.64 --> 1658.3200000000002
and then you might lose track

1659.44 --> 1662.96
right

1660.24 --> 1666.679
spirit mechanics

1662.96 --> 1666.679
that's what it's all about

1670.88 --> 1674.7990000000002
right be careful with your fantasy

1676.399 --> 1684.2399999999998
understand basic logic and like respect

1680.84 --> 1686.72
that and if you wanna

1684.24 --> 1690.08
experiment with ideas have thought

1686.72 --> 1692.88
experiments presuppose things

1690.08 --> 1693.6789999999999
and then build on that what if

1692.88 --> 1696.24
then

1693.679 --> 1698.72
be honest and precise about it because

1696.24 --> 1702.08
if you don't you can literally lead

1698.72 --> 1704.88
people astray now i've always had a very

1702.08 --> 1707.1999999999998
careful sense for that it's like

1704.88 --> 1708.5590000000002
if i would just do that and make people

1707.2 --> 1710.3990000000001
believe things

1708.559 --> 1711.36
and i kind of realized

1710.399 --> 1713.52
that i

1711.36 --> 1715.6
didn't really know that

1713.52 --> 1716.96
because i had the cognition level to

1715.6 --> 1718.559
realize that

1716.96 --> 1720.24
sometimes it would just blabber off and

1718.559 --> 1722.0
really believe it in the moment right

1720.24 --> 1723.039
that wouldn't really do anything

1722.0 --> 1724.88
but

1723.039 --> 1727.44
sometimes i really thought like this is

1724.88 --> 1730.7990000000002
it i'm gonna make this reality almost

1727.44 --> 1733.52
right well when i then engaged

1730.799 --> 1736.24
got this like this weird like during the

1733.52 --> 1738.1589999999999
shine of like being feeling all that

1736.24 --> 1741.76
power and all that being great trying to

1738.159 --> 1742.96
do your best and it's all natural

1741.76 --> 1745.039
all but through the spirit it's a

1742.96 --> 1746.96
conjunction of spirit and body it's all

1745.039 --> 1749.279
through

1746.96 --> 1752.0
going through me channeling it

1749.279 --> 1755.44
and but then yeah if you do something

1752.0 --> 1755.44
that's technically wrong

1755.84 --> 1760.8799999999999
then

1757.679 --> 1762.48
like this dread starts suddenly seeping

1760.88 --> 1764.3990000000001
in with the light

1762.48 --> 1767.6
like a warning like

1764.399 --> 1768.6399999999999
uh this is not good and you almost hear

1767.6 --> 1770.9599999999998
the voice

1768.64 --> 1771.8400000000001
like you almost hear god's voice like

1770.96 --> 1773.76
maybe

1771.84 --> 1776.6399999999999
it might depend on like how your mind

1773.76 --> 1779.52
works if you're more oratory

1776.64 --> 1781.679
more visual like whatever is

1779.52 --> 1785.039
associated with like really high

1781.679 --> 1787.8400000000001
functioning which part of your sensories

1785.039 --> 1790.64
very likely to like have manifestation

1787.84 --> 1792.559
that would almost be like god is

1790.64 --> 1795.279
addressing you

1792.559 --> 1798.96
like hey

1795.279 --> 1798.96
this is a problem

1800.559 --> 1805.84
maybe you recognize this

1803.52 --> 1808.72
right but that's real that's real spirit

1805.84 --> 1810.559
things that really happen like sin is

1808.72 --> 1812.24
real

1810.559 --> 1814.24
and if you have the senses for if you

1812.24 --> 1817.52
haven't just denied if you haven't just

1814.24 --> 1820.72
ruined everything already spiritually

1817.52 --> 1822.799
then you will have that

1820.72 --> 1826.0
those moments where you're like

1822.799 --> 1826.0
wait this is wrong

1826.96 --> 1831.039
and you might even like if you're very

1829.12 --> 1833.1999999999998
intense with a lot of energy feel it

1831.039 --> 1836.1589999999999
like that like oh god's like

1833.2 --> 1839.039
walk suddenly leaning over you like i

1836.159 --> 1840.96
what the hell you think you're doing

1839.039 --> 1842.72
everybody like the people that you're

1840.96 --> 1844.159
addressing might not realize it but

1842.72 --> 1846.24
everybody

1844.159 --> 1847.6000000000001
is watching or god is watching if you

1846.24 --> 1851.6
will

1847.6 --> 1852.8799999999999
like it will be known

1851.6 --> 1856.32
right

1852.88 --> 1856.3200000000002
consciousness conscious

1858.32 --> 1865.0
hey nathan oakley how are you doing

1860.88 --> 1865.0
is it going to be a live show today

1874.0 --> 1878.279
been rambling on for a while

1879.36 --> 1883.039
jd

1880.799 --> 1885.2
right rose color dark you know what that

1883.039 --> 1885.2
is

1888.0 --> 1892.72
it's funny

1890.08 --> 1895.76
it's the thing

1892.72 --> 1900.0
it's a word that's like not used a lot

1895.76 --> 1901.679
but i know it through certain people and

1900.0 --> 1905.519
from what uh

1901.679 --> 1907.279
like the original source might even

1905.519 --> 1909.44
say something slightly different but

1907.279 --> 1911.679
what i understood from rose color darkly

1909.44 --> 1913.1200000000001
is like

1911.679 --> 1915.6000000000001
our mind

1913.12 --> 1918.0
or our spirit is like a lens

1915.6 --> 1919.12
to the world through which you can see

1918.0 --> 1920.96
it and

1919.12 --> 1923.76
how you see it

1920.96 --> 1924.559
is different per person

1923.76 --> 1927.36
and

1924.559 --> 1928.799
like a crystal that like it's slightly

1927.36 --> 1930.8799999999999
different the light that comes through

1928.799 --> 1932.48
it is will be different

1930.88 --> 1934.0800000000002
all right this is a it's a metaphor

1932.48 --> 1936.559
basically

1934.08 --> 1939.84
so the rose color darkly is

1936.559 --> 1941.9189999999999
apparently referencing how everybody has

1939.84 --> 1944.9599999999998
different views and different angles

1941.919 --> 1946.72
even on a spiritual level

1944.96 --> 1949.14
that there will always like that you

1946.72 --> 1950.799
could that it's unreasonable

1949.14 --> 1953.279
[Music]

1950.799 --> 1956.399
to assume that everybody's gonna have

1953.279 --> 1958.64
the same position as you

1956.399 --> 1960.4799999999998
that's also what that kind of

1958.64 --> 1963.48
and yeah that's what's connected to that

1960.48 --> 1963.48
esoterically

1973.81 --> 1981.12
[Music]

1978.0 --> 1984.88
it also happens to be a movie with the

1981.12 --> 1988.84
piano reeves like a weird cartoon

1984.88 --> 1992.3200000000002
like they they painted over the

1988.84 --> 1994.6399999999999
movie think is that the one

1992.32 --> 1994.6399999999999
yeah

2001.6 --> 2008.0
and it has alex jones in it and alex

2004.08 --> 2008.0
jones does like to reference that word

2009.039 --> 2012.72
but i get how he uses it

2014.24 --> 2017.36
oh that's a scanner darkly

2016.24 --> 2020.559
right

2017.36 --> 2023.279
now yeah i'm mixing it up

2020.559 --> 2025.039
yeah that's different

2023.279 --> 2028.919
now okay now i have to look it up or

2025.039 --> 2028.919
it's just going to be embarrassing

2038.08 --> 2041.08
okay

2048.57 --> 2051.719
[Music]

2053.119 --> 2055.76
hmm

2054.72 --> 2057.2799999999997
i missed

2055.76 --> 2059.3590000000004
yeah

2057.28 --> 2060.7200000000003
seems like i basically constructed my

2059.359 --> 2062.96
own thing out of it

2060.72 --> 2064.9599999999996
it's basically like having pink glasses

2062.96 --> 2066.079
and if you look for them you see it like

2064.96 --> 2068.639
differently

2066.079 --> 2069.0800000000004
i think it might be referencing to that

2068.639 --> 2072.199
then

2069.08 --> 2072.199
[Music]

2073.28 --> 2077.28
it's it's still the same principle i

2075.599 --> 2080.56
just thought it had to do with some kind

2077.28 --> 2083.8790000000004
of a crystal or something

2080.56 --> 2083.879
i don't know

2090.159 --> 2095.44
yeah that did not

2091.76 --> 2095.44
yield the expected result

2098.96 --> 2102.76
let's try that again

2102.88 --> 2106.2400000000002
a glass darkly

2113.44 --> 2116.48
what

2115.359 --> 2119.68
man

2116.48 --> 2121.04
like what the hell happened

2119.68 --> 2123.839
how did it

2121.04 --> 2126.88
become that then

2123.839 --> 2128.88
we see through a glass darkly is the

2126.88 --> 2131.599
saying

2128.88 --> 2132.8
think according to this

2131.599 --> 2136.96
i did

2132.8 --> 2136.96
this is not a straightforward thing

2137.28 --> 2143.96
through rose-colored glasses

2140.16 --> 2143.96
so that's that saying

2146.32 --> 2150.4
weird

2147.44 --> 2151.44
it might be some weird movie reference

2150.4 --> 2154.88
then

2151.44 --> 2157.88
that i don't know about or forgot

2154.88 --> 2157.88
[ __ ]

2159.04 --> 2164.0
anyway how confusing that all is

2161.68 --> 2167.2
i always thought of it as like everybody

2164.0 --> 2168.48
has their own unique

2167.2 --> 2171.4399999999996
lens

2168.48 --> 2171.44
of perception

2171.68 --> 2176.24
for their spirit

2173.52 --> 2178.56
and their consciousness

2176.24 --> 2181.1189999999997
and like it's never perfectly the same

2178.56 --> 2181.119
that was

2181.28 --> 2185.44
that was

2183.119 --> 2187.359
what i attributed to it so yeah got

2185.44 --> 2190.4
mandela

2187.359 --> 2192.4
well i mandela at myself

2190.4 --> 2194.88
in this case

2192.4 --> 2197.44
and i have to be fair i've done that in

2194.88 --> 2197.44
the past

2197.68 --> 2202.96
where it's basically something inspired

2200.0 --> 2205.44
me then i saw something really heavy

2202.96 --> 2205.44
into it

2206.96 --> 2211.839
and then later it turns out that what i

2209.28 --> 2214.5600000000004
originally took that inspiration from

2211.839 --> 2216.64
really had nothing to do with that i

2214.56 --> 2218.64
misunderstood because my mind was kind

2216.64 --> 2221.52
of dwelling and dreaming

2218.64 --> 2223.5989999999997
that does happen

2221.52 --> 2225.359
to me because i'm a dreamer

2223.599 --> 2227.6800000000003
right i do

2225.359 --> 2229.2799999999997
kind of utilize

2227.68 --> 2231.9199999999996
the correction

2229.28 --> 2234.32
system that is also tied in with mandela

2231.92 --> 2234.32
effect

2237.119 --> 2242.48
right but it's not like oh so it didn't

2240.24 --> 2244.56
turn out to be that way no no i do

2242.48 --> 2247.68
recognize like how

2244.56 --> 2247.68
where i got it from

2248.16 --> 2250.72
and

2249.2 --> 2254.3999999999996
like alex

2250.72 --> 2256.9599999999996
jones does actually have

2254.4 --> 2260.4
mandela aberrations himself he gets

2256.96 --> 2260.4
constructive with words

2262.079 --> 2266.48
so

2264.32 --> 2268.6400000000003
and when you do that sometimes you it's

2266.48 --> 2270.96
like an aberration you

2268.64 --> 2272.7999999999997
you just start to believe something

2270.96 --> 2274.56
associated with the word that you

2272.8 --> 2277.92
construct it in your mind and you

2274.56 --> 2277.92
totally get what that is

2278.24 --> 2282.7999999999997
but then when you like do fine research

2280.56 --> 2285.839
it it's like off

2282.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
and that's really weird

2286.0 --> 2290.48
to you when you realize that it's very

2288.8 --> 2294.599
unsettling

2290.48 --> 2294.599
but i'm not afraid

2302.079 --> 2307.3590000000004
i might however because of this

2304.16 --> 2308.7999999999997
confusion have to find another

2307.359 --> 2311.839
phrase to

2308.8 --> 2314.2400000000002
express what i'm talking about

2311.839 --> 2316.7999999999997
the room

2314.24 --> 2319.04
lens of consciousness

2316.8 --> 2320.48
yeah but that doesn't emphasize the

2319.04 --> 2324.2799999999997
difference

2320.48 --> 2324.28
any in any way

2328.72 --> 2334.24
i could just insert fractal again but

2330.88 --> 2339.119
that's almost getting kind of tedious

2334.24 --> 2339.1189999999997
everybody has their own fractal lens

2339.2 --> 2342.3199999999997
for their consciousness

2343.92 --> 2347.839
it's not really even about the

2346.0 --> 2352.52
consciousness that that's just the

2347.839 --> 2352.52
assembly process it's really about

2355.52 --> 2360.16
the assembly of

2358.0 --> 2362.8
what drives you your feelings and your

2360.16 --> 2366.0
opinions and it is dynamic but

2362.8 --> 2368.96
it's almost like a subset of that

2366.0 --> 2370.24
it's like how will you naturally respond

2368.96 --> 2372.32
to typical

2370.24 --> 2375.2
presented situations

2372.32 --> 2378.2400000000002
from several different vantage points of

2375.2 --> 2378.24
like motivation

2378.4 --> 2381.359
right

2379.599 --> 2384.0
that's kind of what i'm talking about

2381.359 --> 2386.24
yeah oh it's it's not complicated at all

2384.0 --> 2388.64
how are we i know oh it's

2386.24 --> 2390.3199999999997
so simple everybody's gonna get that oh

2388.64 --> 2393.359
yes

2390.32 --> 2397.1600000000003
oh dear god

2393.359 --> 2397.16
maybe some of you will

2405.2 --> 2410.359
ah

2407.04 --> 2410.359
right anyway

2412.319 --> 2416.319
apparent medela effect

2414.319 --> 2418.319
revealings don't

2416.319 --> 2420.96
surprise me anymore they don't confuse

2418.319 --> 2423.52
me i know what it is i'm very certain

2420.96 --> 2425.92
about that

2423.52 --> 2428.319
to the point that i would actually

2425.92 --> 2429.6800000000003
start to bet my life on it as i would

2428.319 --> 2432.079
just like

2429.68 --> 2434.72
other things that i just know like yeah

2432.079 --> 2437.7200000000003
this is safe and i can test why it's

2434.72 --> 2437.72
safe

2438.48 --> 2442.48
like a bridge

2440.24 --> 2443.4399999999996
for example

2442.48 --> 2445.52
like

2443.44 --> 2447.52
knowing like okay this bridge the way it

2445.52 --> 2449.359
looks the way it feels

2447.52 --> 2450.64
that's definitely not gonna break when i

2449.359 --> 2453.68
walk over it

2450.64 --> 2455.44
right but you're effectively potentially

2453.68 --> 2457.7599999999998
risking your life what if you were wrong

2455.44 --> 2458.64
right well

2457.76 --> 2460.88
yeah

2458.64 --> 2463.52
i lost my point but

2460.88 --> 2466.52
i hope it still came across

2463.52 --> 2466.52
yeah

2467.839 --> 2474.319
yeah it was about relying on my insight

2470.96 --> 2476.0
on the mandela effect it doesn't

2474.319 --> 2478.64
shock me anymore

2476.0 --> 2478.64
and i like

2478.96 --> 2483.68
i could probably like remedy it for

2481.44 --> 2487.76
people

2483.68 --> 2487.7599999999998
that really have a tough time with it

2488.079 --> 2492.8390000000004
that constantly feel like everything is

2490.16 --> 2494.7999999999997
wrong because that might happen

2492.839 --> 2497.359
right

2494.8 --> 2499.28
and it's even like some old people get

2497.359 --> 2500.96
trapped in that

2499.28 --> 2503.119
because yeah the older you get the more

2500.96 --> 2505.04
things are just not going to be

2503.119 --> 2506.7200000000003
the way you remember

2505.04 --> 2510.16
and that's not

2506.72 --> 2511.68
because you even remembered it wrong

2510.16 --> 2512.8799999999997
it's just because

2511.68 --> 2515.04
the entire

2512.88 --> 2518.319
world changed

2515.04 --> 2521.119
and so your memories don't really

2518.319 --> 2525.04
fit in between it all anymore all that

2521.119 --> 2528.04
well and that's really demoralizing

2525.04 --> 2528.04
right

2540.72 --> 2545.52
uh

2542.72 --> 2550.4399999999996
everybody's getting all

2545.52 --> 2550.44
going in in the workshop awesome

2555.65 --> 2558.78
[Music]

2562.88 --> 2565.839
right

2566.079 --> 2572.1600000000003
i might still be using the word rose

2568.079 --> 2572.1600000000003
color darkly in the future it

2572.4 --> 2575.839
because it kind of did have a prominent

2574.4 --> 2577.599
place

2575.839 --> 2579.839
even though it turns out to be a bit of

2577.599 --> 2582.4
an aberration perhaps

2579.839 --> 2584.56
or literally nobody that's addressing me

2582.4 --> 2587.2000000000003
right now knows

2584.56 --> 2587.2
what that is

2588.319 --> 2593.079
because it might still remember it

2590.079 --> 2593.079
correctly

2599.76 --> 2603.2000000000003
but yeah google search definitely did

2602.16 --> 2604.839
not

2603.2 --> 2607.1189999999997
provide what i

2604.839 --> 2609.119
expected i don't know if that's google

2607.119 --> 2610.4
or or if that's me

2609.119 --> 2612.0
you see

2610.4 --> 2614.319
uh

2612.0 --> 2619.079
the way to find out is to start

2614.319 --> 2619.079
cross-referencing it with everybody else

2623.52 --> 2627.7599999999998
what's going on

2626.0 --> 2631.359
getting sick

2627.76 --> 2631.3590000000004
damn it that might not oh jesus

2632.64 --> 2637.2799999999997
oh

2634.88 --> 2637.28
all right

2650.64 --> 2653.5989999999997
what do you think what do you feel about

2652.56 --> 2656.56
it

2653.599 --> 2656.56
is it is it just

2657.599 --> 2662.7200000000003
like was he

2659.52 --> 2666.0
really yeah i don't know

2662.72 --> 2666.0
might be all too soon

2673.68 --> 2677.68
me am i gonna be silent for a minute

2675.599 --> 2680.839
tomorrow what

2677.68 --> 2680.839
for what

2700.72 --> 2705.56
what

2702.319 --> 2705.56
what's happening

2706.72 --> 2709.359
oh right

2709.599 --> 2711.92
oh

2713.52 --> 2716.839
oh yeah

2714.8 --> 2718.6400000000003
i remember though

2716.839 --> 2720.24
yeah

2718.64 --> 2722.319
i mean

2720.24 --> 2724.7999999999997
i'm not gonna like have a party or

2722.319 --> 2727.359
anything it just kind of i always forget

2724.8 --> 2727.3590000000004
about that

2728.56 --> 2733.839
i mean at this point it feels like come

2731.119 --> 2736.2400000000002
on man

2733.839 --> 2736.24
really

2738.16 --> 2740.48
hey

2741.04 --> 2746.04
what what are you doing

2742.56 --> 2746.04
ladder sage

2752.24 --> 2758.8799999999997
why is your time

2754.96 --> 2761.2
whixing yourself out

2758.88 --> 2765.1600000000003
it was just asking about like a thing

2761.2 --> 2765.16
that we do here in the netherlands

2775.52 --> 2782.48
rose-colored glasses huh

2779.359 --> 2784.24
that's weird well it

2782.48 --> 2785.04
well at least see

2784.24 --> 2786.839
yeah

2785.04 --> 2788.4
you know

2786.839 --> 2792.72
maybe

2788.4 --> 2795.2000000000003
me remembering rose color darkly is

2792.72 --> 2798.319
like still in a more wide

2795.2 --> 2801.56
mandela effect that more people just

2798.319 --> 2801.56
had that

2813.359 --> 2819.119
this uh

2816.4 --> 2820.8
i don't know but yeah the the movie the

2819.119 --> 2823.2000000000003
scanner darkly

2820.8 --> 2824.88
is about that about perception about

2823.2 --> 2827.04
through what type of

2824.88 --> 2831.56
lens are you gonna see the world it it

2827.04 --> 2831.56
is like kind of surreal like that

2832.15 --> 2835.32
[Music]

2835.52 --> 2841.119
so it is about the subject that i

2839.119 --> 2844.4
associated with the word

2841.119 --> 2846.4
the description the metaphor

2844.4 --> 2848.64
spirit mechanics

2846.4 --> 2848.64
but

2848.8 --> 2854.6400000000003
yeah that word in itself doesn't really

2852.16 --> 2857.5989999999997
seem to find any root

2854.64 --> 2862.1189999999997
so the word might be

2857.599 --> 2862.119
like a mandela effect aberration

2878.08 --> 2881.739
[Music]

2887.4 --> 2896.64
[Music]

2894.4 --> 2898.96
but hey if you somehow can find a

2896.64 --> 2902.72
reference to the word rose color darkly

2898.96 --> 2902.7200000000003
other than me talking about it

2903.119 --> 2906.1600000000003
like other people using it and how are

2904.8 --> 2908.319
they using it

2906.16 --> 2911.5989999999997
do they explain it sometime i know alex

2908.319 --> 2914.72
jones did i remember that

2911.599 --> 2916.559
but yeah it might been a while ago

2914.72 --> 2919.2
but yeah

2916.559 --> 2921.6800000000003
i'm not really good at like finding [ __ ]

2919.2 --> 2925.2
out there on the internet

2921.68 --> 2928.3999999999996
might be aware about that by now

2925.2 --> 2930.0
but you might figure it out and i am

2928.4 --> 2932.4
interested to

2930.0 --> 2932.4
to know

2935.28 --> 2938.8
what's going on in amsterdam reference

2937.839 --> 2939.92
what

2938.8 --> 2941.52
oh

2939.92 --> 2943.04
yeah it's

2941.52 --> 2945.52
fourth of may

2943.04 --> 2946.5589999999997
uh yeah remembrance day it's basically

2945.52 --> 2948.48
where we

2946.559 --> 2951.3590000000004
remember the

2948.48 --> 2951.359
world war ii

2951.92 --> 2956.64
victims in general it's like a

2954.559 --> 2959.44
like soldiers that were in the

2956.64 --> 2962.7999999999997
resistance and just like the people that

2959.44 --> 2965.44
got killed that that's what fourth may

2962.8 --> 2967.04
a moment of silence is about

2965.44 --> 2968.2400000000002
and then usually

2967.04 --> 2971.119
it's like

2968.24 --> 2973.1189999999997
a square in amsterdam

2971.119 --> 2976.48
like the either the

2973.119 --> 2979.28
the nobility gets involved

2976.48 --> 2981.28
somebody makes a speech about it

2979.28 --> 2984.76
they lay the uh

2981.28 --> 2984.76
they call it

2985.359 --> 2989.839
like a

2987.599 --> 2992.7200000000003
like a ring of flowers

2989.839 --> 2995.2
and they have trumpets

2992.72 --> 2996.8799999999997
i think or this yeah there's somebody

2995.2 --> 2997.68
that's going to play trump in a certain

2996.88 --> 2999.28
song

2997.68 --> 3001.5989999999997
and then

2999.28 --> 3002.8
you complete silence for i think two

3001.599 --> 3006.079
minutes

3002.8 --> 3008.88
and then they play like the

3006.079 --> 3010.88
the national anthem

3008.88 --> 3012.319
so that's what it is

3010.88 --> 3014.7200000000003
and the netherlands has been doing it

3012.319 --> 3018.5589999999997
for a very long time

3014.72 --> 3018.5589999999997
like i i do respect that

3018.8 --> 3022.4
it is like

3020.24 --> 3025.04
a bit of a remnant of like a national

3022.4 --> 3027.44
feeling but yeah with how the world is

3025.04 --> 3028.72
really working right now it it does kind

3027.44 --> 3030.64
of like

3028.72 --> 3034.9599999999996
i don't say look oh throw it away

3030.64 --> 3036.96
absolutely not it's just that hello

3034.96 --> 3037.92
hello we're looking at the world right

3036.96 --> 3039.599
now

3037.92 --> 3042.2400000000002
right while you're trying to remember

3039.599 --> 3044.559
something in the past it it's

3042.24 --> 3047.839
kind of like getting

3044.559 --> 3050.079
right there right now

3047.839 --> 3050.0789999999997
so

3052.64 --> 3056.319
at least

3053.839 --> 3058.4
if they could if they wanted to if they

3056.319 --> 3060.24
dare to

3058.4 --> 3062.48
point like

3060.24 --> 3064.3999999999996
warn us like hello this is happening

3062.48 --> 3069.839
right now and don't make it like oh it's

3064.4 --> 3069.839
a russian trust like if they do that no

3071.28 --> 3073.52
just

3075.359 --> 3078.88
i don't know what's gonna happen

3077.599 --> 3080.7200000000003
i just hope

3078.88 --> 3083.52
the speech is not gonna contain some

3080.72 --> 3085.4399999999996
terrible political

3083.52 --> 3090.04
objective

3085.44 --> 3090.04
that would be just super gross

3106.88 --> 3112.0
i mean seriously they they better not

3109.52 --> 3114.079
freaking compare like putin to hitler or

3112.0 --> 3116.319
something in that speech

3114.079 --> 3119.2000000000003
they better not do that that's gonna

3116.319 --> 3119.92
piss off so many people

3119.2 --> 3122.0789999999997
like

3119.92 --> 3124.319
dude

3122.079 --> 3125.2000000000003
so yeah i don't know if they'll go there

3124.319 --> 3127.839
or not

3125.2 --> 3130.0
they have some dignity left for these

3127.839 --> 3131.68
old folks that are still alive like

3130.0 --> 3133.839
there are still a couple of them alive i

3131.68 --> 3133.839
think

3135.119 --> 3138.52
real old-timers

3156.72 --> 3159.04
what

3160.079 --> 3162.559
okay

3164.8 --> 3167.8
huh

3172.4 --> 3176.8
do i think alex is a cia plant

3176.96 --> 3179.2
no

3179.28 --> 3183.28
but he does kind of mess around

3190.559 --> 3194.6400000000003
and he

3191.44 --> 3196.64
like he is kind of part of like a rumor

3194.64 --> 3198.96
mill thing

3196.64 --> 3201.2
and by his own choice it's like

3198.96 --> 3201.2
yeah

3205.119 --> 3210.559
but yeah he's definitely adapting to

3207.44 --> 3211.359
like narratives

3210.559 --> 3212.6400000000003
like

3211.359 --> 3216.16
yeah

3212.64 --> 3217.5989999999997
he has been like grafted into a bigger

3216.16 --> 3218.48
plan

3217.599 --> 3220.7200000000003
right

3218.48 --> 3223.839
so in a way yeah

3220.72 --> 3223.839
that's not cia

3227.2 --> 3232.3999999999996
like he's not some kind of a puppet

3229.359 --> 3232.4
that'll do whatever

3232.48 --> 3237.52
like a sacrificial puppet

3234.72 --> 3238.64
this he's not like that

3237.52 --> 3240.72
he is

3238.64 --> 3242.64
effectively his own man

3240.72 --> 3244.5589999999997
but

3242.64 --> 3247.44
he does kind of

3244.559 --> 3248.6400000000003
he does like play the dance

3247.44 --> 3251.839
he does

3248.64 --> 3254.5589999999997
like weird around a bit

3251.839 --> 3255.52
and he does dabble in narratives and

3254.559 --> 3258.52
like

3255.52 --> 3258.52
programming

3273.839 --> 3276.839
what

3294.24 --> 3299.4399999999996
okay well that's an interesting

3296.24 --> 3299.4399999999996
postulation there

3300.72 --> 3305.16
over the top conspiracy theory

3307.76 --> 3310.0
well

3312.64 --> 3319.0
not all of them are really that over the

3314.96 --> 3319.0
top in the sense that

3323.839 --> 3326.88
a lot of it is real

3327.28 --> 3332.0
it's just that he kind of like over

3329.44 --> 3334.319
emphasizes things

3332.0 --> 3336.4
might interconnect them in ways that

3334.319 --> 3339.44
isn't actually real

3336.4 --> 3341.76
but yeah what he and what he draws in is

3339.44 --> 3341.76
[ __ ]

3342.0 --> 3345.839
that

3343.44 --> 3347.92
it is real

3345.839 --> 3351.2799999999997
except for it like the standard things

3347.92 --> 3353.6800000000003
right like moon landing

3351.28 --> 3353.6800000000003
nukes

3358.24 --> 3362.799
and also his narrative which he holds on

3360.96 --> 3366.16
to with a whole bunch of other people

3362.799 --> 3369.359
like muslims batman like that that's now

3366.16 --> 3369.359
the grabbler or something

3369.68 --> 3372.68
that

3374.06 --> 3377.21
[Music]

3389.18 --> 3392.2599999999998
[Music]

3394.64 --> 3397.839
they're turning the frogs here oh you

3396.319 --> 3399.92
thought that's a joke matthew yeah

3397.839 --> 3402.5589999999997
that's that's real

3399.92 --> 3402.559
that's real

3403.599 --> 3406.88
it is

3405.119 --> 3408.96
when he says that they're turning the

3406.88 --> 3411.839
freaking frogs gay it's not like they're

3408.96 --> 3415.7200000000003
like wiping them out on purpose

3411.839 --> 3415.72
it's just like recklessness

3422.88 --> 3427.52
right but yeah if it's always

3424.88 --> 3430.2400000000002
recklessness that does that then you can

3427.52 --> 3432.559
kind of like in your mind conjure that

3430.24 --> 3434.24
that recklessness is actually a spirit

3432.559 --> 3438.2400000000002
that just wants to destroy everything

3434.24 --> 3438.24
right and that is kind of satan

3442.48 --> 3448.4
but that is effectively fed by the

3445.2 --> 3451.1189999999997
people that caused these sort of things

3448.4 --> 3452.559
to be reckless and just careless and

3451.119 --> 3455.119
just arrogant

3452.559 --> 3457.44
terrible morals and they just let it

3455.119 --> 3457.44
happen

3458.16 --> 3462.8799999999997
well if you then say they're turning the

3460.4 --> 3464.079
freaking frogs gay like satan is like

3462.88 --> 3466.88
doing that

3464.079 --> 3468.319
gay frogs gay frogs every frog i point

3466.88 --> 3470.079
at is gay now

3468.319 --> 3473.4
right that's

3470.079 --> 3473.4
it's metaphorical

3482.16 --> 3487.52
you're a leftist glober

3485.52 --> 3489.52
and you believe alex jones is correct

3487.52 --> 3491.839
most of the time

3489.52 --> 3494.24
what

3491.839 --> 3494.24
okay

3496.72 --> 3499.359
terp alert

3501.28 --> 3507.8390000000004
all right i know it's it's not that like

3504.16 --> 3507.839
i kind of used to be that

3511.44 --> 3516.92
right it's like what are you gonna do

3513.04 --> 3516.92
with it how are you gonna explore

3517.04 --> 3521.2799999999997
that

3518.48 --> 3523.119
field of thinking like

3521.28 --> 3526.079
you like to hang around with like other

3523.119 --> 3528.4
alex jones fans and all that

3526.079 --> 3530.2400000000002
are you tapping into like a community or

3528.4 --> 3533.88
like

3530.24 --> 3533.8799999999997
what is it to you

3550.48 --> 3554.319
yeah that's right

3551.68 --> 3557.2
jeff guy said jones does back up with

3554.319 --> 3557.2
documentation

3557.839 --> 3563.95
right but he also blabbers a bunch and

3560.799 --> 3567.15
he gets really silly sometimes

3563.95 --> 3567.1499999999996
[Music]

3582.4 --> 3586.319
right and yeah by the way matthew yeah

3584.48 --> 3588.799
the joke

3586.319 --> 3591.119
about why alex jones did the gay frog

3588.799 --> 3593.2
thing why did he do it

3591.119 --> 3595.44
to spread around

3593.2 --> 3597.68
to get in people's face it was

3595.44 --> 3600.48
advertisement it's an advertisement he's

3597.68 --> 3602.72
he was kind of open about that

3600.48 --> 3605.28
just making it silly

3602.72 --> 3607.04
so that it can become a meme and like

3605.28 --> 3608.96
effectively little kids will start

3607.04 --> 3610.24
showing it to each other

3608.96 --> 3613.2
right

3610.24 --> 3615.5989999999997
because it is funny just as a standalone

3613.2 --> 3618.5589999999997
it is funny like yeah freaking frogs are

3615.599 --> 3621.119
gay it's really it's funny

3618.559 --> 3624.6800000000003
so it's just

3621.119 --> 3624.6800000000003
that's what he did

3631.599 --> 3635.52
right and then one day at some point

3633.599 --> 3638.079
somebody's gonna ask like where do you

3635.52 --> 3639.92
what is this alex jones and frog gay

3638.079 --> 3643.3590000000004
that's so silly

3639.92 --> 3645.76
and then they might investigate right

3643.359 --> 3647.5989999999997
even though it's like passed on through

3645.76 --> 3650.48
kids or whatever people that don't

3647.599 --> 3653.839
really care or even read him

3650.48 --> 3656.16
uh probably yeah to ridicule him right

3653.839 --> 3658.16
and then it's just gonna find somebody

3656.16 --> 3661.2
that's gonna be like hey what the hell's

3658.16 --> 3662.319
he taught like is there anything to this

3661.2 --> 3664.24
right and

3662.319 --> 3667.119
that was the purpose

3664.24 --> 3668.9599999999996
that's why he did that

3667.119 --> 3672.559
and he was in a position where that

3668.96 --> 3672.559
could work and it did work

3673.04 --> 3678.72
i mean you'd be surprised how many

3675.359 --> 3682.319
people know about angry man

3678.72 --> 3684.72
yelling about the freaking frogs are gay

3682.319 --> 3687.119
that like a lot of people out there in

3684.72 --> 3690.8799999999997
all kinds of countries know that now

3687.119 --> 3693.119
right as not valuable knowledge

3690.88 --> 3695.52
but it is basically

3693.119 --> 3698.52
free meme advertisement it is very

3695.52 --> 3698.52
effective

3698.559 --> 3702.0
oh see you later get in sick

3702.64 --> 3706.359
yeah good luck man

3725.68 --> 3729.359
yeah just remember keep your spirits up

3728.0 --> 3731.039
like

3729.359 --> 3732.64
whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen

3731.039 --> 3735.039
anyway and

3732.64 --> 3736.8799999999997
you worrying about it

3735.039 --> 3738.7200000000003
might even not help unless like

3736.88 --> 3741.119
something in the moment happens and you

3738.72 --> 3742.8799999999997
pick up and like hey this shouldn't be

3741.119 --> 3744.6400000000003
done

3742.88 --> 3748.799
right other than that

3744.64 --> 3748.799
don't worry about it too much like just

3750.48 --> 3754.52
good energy it helps

3754.64 --> 3758.4
it helps you and it will help your dad

3759.2 --> 3762.319
anyway you probably know that

3763.92 --> 3766.92
um

3775.15 --> 3778.369
[Music]

3782.53 --> 3786.0890000000004
[Music]

3821.119 --> 3824.119
hmm

3845.119 --> 3850.839
pilot

3846.319 --> 3850.839
what are you talking about kevlar

3876.96 --> 3879.96
okay

3887.52 --> 3892.559
yeah terra 36 you saw that

3890.079 --> 3895.039
yeah alex dean is

3892.559 --> 3897.52
it's one hell of a clown

3895.039 --> 3900.3190000000004
but i like him

3897.52 --> 3902.88
it's crazy it's not really even my taste

3900.319 --> 3906.359
but the guy has some

3902.88 --> 3906.359
some energy

3908.4 --> 3912.4
it is

3909.839 --> 3914.0789999999997
like it is something to behold that the

3912.4 --> 3917.079
things that he does

3914.079 --> 3917.079
sometimes

3930.24 --> 3934.319
dude kevlar

3932.4 --> 3937.319
what are you why are you joking about

3934.319 --> 3937.319
that

3942.24 --> 3948.3999999999996
i mean i had a whole show yesterday

3944.559 --> 3948.4
about drugs and all that

3948.559 --> 3952.559
is that really funny

3950.799 --> 3957.24
are you sure you want to joke about that

3952.559 --> 3957.2400000000002
like in a public chat like that

3971.28 --> 3975.599
yeah you were playing on it

3973.599 --> 3979.6400000000003
it's not that well yeah yeah but you're

3975.599 --> 3979.6400000000003
playing around with that

3980.0 --> 3985.68
i'm sorry to be like a stick in the mud

3982.64 --> 3987.92
here but come on

3985.68 --> 3989.68
this is not a smoky back room place to

3987.92 --> 3993.6800000000003
just go wherever you want with your

3989.68 --> 3996.0
jokes right and get gross or get wrong

3993.68 --> 3998.5589999999997
just because you understand this is like

3996.0 --> 4001.559
a workshop situation not a smoky back

3998.559 --> 4001.559
room

4010.24 --> 4013.24
anyway

4030.4 --> 4035.44
4 20 am oh

4033.68 --> 4039.0389999999998
i had a whole show yesterday yeah of

4035.44 --> 4039.039
course i had a little show yesterday

4040.48 --> 4044.28
pretty long one too

4054.4 --> 4058.92
two hours and 16 minutes

4095.839 --> 4099.6
ah

4097.199 --> 4102.599999999999
there will be a live fed show today

4099.6 --> 4102.6
woohoo

4104.799 --> 4107.799
hey

4131.199 --> 4136.159
right but before that still got like 15

4133.44 --> 4139.599999999999
minutes to go so

4136.159 --> 4139.599999999999
what do you guys want to talk about

4139.92 --> 4144.4400000000005
or what do you want me to talk about

4146.239 --> 4152.2789999999995
did you just get in trouble again yeah

4148.56 --> 4152.279
yeah you did keflar

4160.0 --> 4162.319
oh

4164.239 --> 4166.48
cool

4167.92 --> 4173.96
yeah looking forward to that ellis g

4170.719 --> 4173.96
well done

4185.04 --> 4192.719
phil b told you mass attracts mass

4188.08 --> 4192.719
yesterday is he correct no

4199.04 --> 4204.8
yeah but whenever like i have a memory

4202.32 --> 4207.5199999999995
of like a nasa person

4204.8 --> 4209.52
literally related to that

4207.52 --> 4211.679
supposedly proving that to me with some

4209.52 --> 4214.080000000001
contraption

4211.679 --> 4215.92
showing that oh look if you

4214.08 --> 4218.159
like it wasn't even like the cavendish

4215.92 --> 4219.36
it was some other device but it was

4218.159 --> 4222.719
metal

4219.36 --> 4222.719
and i'm like so

4223.36 --> 4232.0
can i vary that no this is okay

4228.4 --> 4233.599999999999
it was just a wizard trick

4232.0 --> 4237.92
like

4233.6 --> 4237.92
mass doesn't actually attract mass

4238.159 --> 4241.96
it's just not true

4271.28 --> 4273.679
this

4275.76 --> 4279.4400000000005
[Music]

4277.52 --> 4282.719
they weren't hundred percent yeah no no

4279.44 --> 4286.32
the mass doesn't attract mass like

4282.719 --> 4287.44
yeah sure things

4286.32 --> 4289.92
happen

4287.44 --> 4294.4
but mass doesn't attract mass like mass

4289.92 --> 4296.4800000000005
isn't even like in physics of thing

4294.4 --> 4298.639999999999
it's a convention

4296.48 --> 4301.36
right density is the only thing that's

4298.64 --> 4304.0
real that's palpable

4301.36 --> 4304.0
provable

4304.88 --> 4310.2390000000005
and yeah there is another

4307.84 --> 4312.719
well-developed system with that it's

4310.239 --> 4316.879999999999
called relative density or

4312.719 --> 4316.88
density just density that

4317.44 --> 4321.44
depends

4319.84 --> 4324.56
right we

4321.44 --> 4328.32
for like the guys through fed

4324.56 --> 4330.96
we started calling it relative density

4328.32 --> 4333.84
but i think that it basically exists and

4330.96 --> 4336.56
it's just called density

4333.84 --> 4340.1990000000005
within physics books if you're gonna

4336.56 --> 4340.1990000000005
find it right

4346.08 --> 4351.199
right but yeah that might still be

4348.08 --> 4353.12
convoluted and and like oh say still

4351.199 --> 4355.28
claim that it's somehow caused by

4353.12 --> 4357.84
gravity and that's like oh it's rel

4355.28 --> 4360.4
density and buoyancy

4357.84 --> 4362.96
because that is what it is it's just not

4360.4 --> 4366.799999999999
caused by gravity there's no gravity

4362.96 --> 4366.8
involved you can't very manipulate it

4368.08 --> 4372.08
they don't know what it is

4369.679 --> 4374.88
it's not mass attracting mass not of a

4372.08 --> 4376.8
field of attraction

4374.88 --> 4379.36
it's not this bending of space-time

4376.8 --> 4381.4400000000005
because neither of those elements exist

4379.36 --> 4383.28
as physical

4381.44 --> 4386.879999999999
so

4383.28 --> 4386.88
yeah it's just a dead end

4388.8 --> 4394.88
but density is real

4391.84 --> 4396.4800000000005
and relative density system that the

4394.88 --> 4400.4800000000005
system for that

4396.48 --> 4400.48
is very provable scientifically

4403.6 --> 4408.719
if an object is denser than the medium

4406.8 --> 4409.92
it is in

4408.719 --> 4412.4
it will

4409.92 --> 4414.88
displace down the force

4412.4 --> 4417.12
because of the disequilibrium between

4414.88 --> 4419.52
the density and the mean of the object

4417.12 --> 4422.32
and the medium because of force to

4419.52 --> 4424.88
manifest it will start to displace

4422.32 --> 4426.719
the object

4424.88 --> 4428.719
downward

4426.719 --> 4431.199
and then

4428.719 --> 4433.12
if it's the opposite

4431.199 --> 4435.759999999999
the object somehow

4433.12 --> 4437.84
can contain gas like a and a helium

4435.76 --> 4440.8
balloon is effectively an object because

4437.84 --> 4443.360000000001
it is contained within the rubber

4440.8 --> 4446.8
or it if its density is less than the

4443.36 --> 4450.32
air that surrounds it it might go up

4446.8 --> 4451.92
or except it will go up every time

4450.32 --> 4455.36
so

4451.92 --> 4457.92
gravity doesn't get involved

4455.36 --> 4460.32
gravity assumes weight it assumes that

4457.92 --> 4462.4
all things

4460.32 --> 4465.599999999999
are displaced because of a

4462.4 --> 4467.599999999999
an attractive force

4465.6 --> 4471.679
downward that everything goes down

4467.6 --> 4471.679
including gas and gas doesn't go down

4479.199 --> 4483.32
sock account what

4485.12 --> 4489.719
do what are you talking about

4502.48 --> 4508.12
what do you mean derp alert the guy's

4504.32 --> 4508.12
asking good questions

4512.239 --> 4517.199
oh wait did he ask me about simon dan

4515.04 --> 4519.76
what the hell

4517.199 --> 4521.199
did it have a good if

4519.76 --> 4525.12
uh

4521.199 --> 4528.599999999999
simon then was a waste of my time as

4525.12 --> 4528.599999999999
as he is

4540.96 --> 4545.92
flat earth is stationary or is it moving

4543.36 --> 4547.28
up no it's not moving upward

4545.92 --> 4552.04
it is

4547.28 --> 4552.04
earth is flat stationary and contained

4553.44 --> 4559.759999999999
and there is no force due to the earth

4557.28 --> 4562.4
accelerating upwards

4559.76 --> 4565.4400000000005
yeah there is no uniform one directional

4562.4 --> 4568.5599999999995
force that it doesn't exist

4565.44 --> 4569.839999999999
relative density shows you

4568.56 --> 4574.4800000000005
another

4569.84 --> 4574.4800000000005
way of configuring what is happening

4575.52 --> 4581.280000000001
it's all about the enclosed system and

4578.48 --> 4583.919999999999
the density division and that's how it

4581.28 --> 4585.44
works why well i don't know why it's

4583.92 --> 4587.92
just how it works

4585.44 --> 4590.879999999999
there is no force

4587.92 --> 4595.1990000000005
behavior of material within the realm

4590.88 --> 4596.8
proves that there isn't a singular force

4595.199 --> 4598.96
that might be

4596.8 --> 4603.28
caused speculative

4598.96 --> 4603.28
because earth is accelerating upward

4603.84 --> 4607.08
it isn't

4632.56 --> 4636.56
uh

4633.76 --> 4640.04
[Music]

4636.56 --> 4640.04
anything else

4671.84 --> 4676.1990000000005
can accelerate forever nothing

4689.76 --> 4694.0
a whole floor

4691.52 --> 4695.360000000001
relative density it already reference

4694.0 --> 4698.239
you

4695.36 --> 4699.759999999999
when physics books talk about density

4698.239 --> 4702.4
and then they might present you with

4699.76 --> 4704.84
density and buoyancy

4702.4 --> 4708.0
that's effectively what it is

4704.84 --> 4710.64
however there's any mechanical

4708.0 --> 4713.36
suggestions within there that say it is

4710.64 --> 4714.159000000001
because of gravity you just leave that

4713.36 --> 4717.5199999999995
out

4714.159 --> 4717.5199999999995
it doesn't need to be there

4717.679 --> 4721.84
take that part out that's how it works

4723.12 --> 4726.88
so there is no gravity

4728.48 --> 4731.959999999999
right

4729.92 --> 4738.159
relative density is a

4731.96 --> 4738.159
phraseology that we and me myself use

4738.64 --> 4744.88
sleeping warrior uses that

4741.12 --> 4744.88
we use it over at fed

4746.08 --> 4751.92
but there are references of it

4749.44 --> 4753.678999999999
within physics

4751.92 --> 4754.88
they will be labeled density and

4753.679 --> 4757.92
buoyancy

4754.88 --> 4761.679
it's effectively how it works however it

4757.92 --> 4764.2390000000005
is like polluted it's the idea

4761.679 --> 4766.56
they graft on top of that but it's

4764.239 --> 4768.799999999999
caused by gravity

4766.56 --> 4768.8
right

4770.08 --> 4774.48
you know there's other people out there

4771.76 --> 4777.04
including flat earthers that make it

4774.48 --> 4778.959999999999
like their jobs for some reason

4777.04 --> 4781.679
to then replace

4778.96 --> 4784.0
that gravity assumption about density

4781.679 --> 4787.04
versus buoyancy

4784.0 --> 4789.28
and then say oh instead it's caused by

4787.04 --> 4792.08
this or that or

4789.28 --> 4795.199
incoherent dielectric acceleration right

4792.08 --> 4796.159
it's a replacement

4795.199 --> 4800.08
of

4796.159 --> 4802.08
the fictional graph that was put on top

4800.08 --> 4805.08
the general explanation of density and

4802.08 --> 4805.08
buoyancy

4806.08 --> 4810.48
if you literally leave

4808.159 --> 4813.44
it out and just take density and

4810.48 --> 4816.0
buoyancy you effectively get relative

4813.44 --> 4816.0
density

4816.08 --> 4820.96
you can use any explanation in physics

4819.04 --> 4823.28
books out there

4820.96 --> 4824.719
as long as you separate the gravity

4823.28 --> 4827.96
suggestion

4824.719 --> 4827.96
all works

4837.679 --> 4842.08
g is acceleration yeah i think that that

4840.56 --> 4843.6
should be correct yeah within the

4842.08 --> 4846.08
mechanics

4843.6 --> 4847.280000000001
that's effectively what they use it for

4846.08 --> 4848.8
i think

4847.28 --> 4851.5199999999995
and now it's been a while since i

4848.8 --> 4854.52
actually dug into like detailed physics

4851.52 --> 4854.52
books

4861.12 --> 4867.28
why that's a that's a false

4864.239 --> 4867.28
premise question

4868.56 --> 4875.56
acceleration change by latitude it what

4872.4 --> 4875.5599999999995
it doesn't

4879.679 --> 4881.52
right

4880.719 --> 4883.52
if

4881.52 --> 4886.56
the medium however

4883.52 --> 4888.400000000001
if its density is changing because like

4886.56 --> 4890.0
the air is different there's less

4888.4 --> 4892.96
pressure there's more pressure less

4890.0 --> 4894.48
moist in the air more moist in the air

4892.96 --> 4897.12
then

4894.48 --> 4899.36
things displacing within it due to

4897.12 --> 4901.92
relative density because the let's say

4899.36 --> 4904.08
an object and heavy object it's going to

4901.92 --> 4906.4
always be heavier than the air right

4904.08 --> 4910.4
it's always going to be heavier

4906.4 --> 4912.638999999999
a lead ball is never going to be not

4910.4 --> 4914.96
denser than the medium it is in except

4912.639 --> 4918.0
if you put it in mercury or something

4914.96 --> 4921.04
right we're talking about the air

4918.0 --> 4923.679
so the air is different

4921.04 --> 4925.92
the tropical regions as it is

4923.679 --> 4928.0
the farther north you go because the

4925.92 --> 4929.28
temperature is different

4928.0 --> 4932.08
so the

4929.28 --> 4933.84
content of the air will be different and

4932.08 --> 4935.679
its density

4933.84 --> 4939.12
so things will potentially have

4935.679 --> 4940.32
different levels of friction

4939.12 --> 4942.32
objects

4940.32 --> 4944.719
dense objects will have different level

4942.32 --> 4946.639
friction with the air as they drop that

4944.719 --> 4948.4800000000005
might be

4946.639 --> 4950.32
the distinct measurable

4948.48 --> 4952.718999999999
thing that happens

4950.32 --> 4955.599999999999
does it mean that

4952.719 --> 4958.08
the suggested cause

4955.6 --> 4960.4800000000005
of the acceleration

4958.08 --> 4961.679
popularly claimed to be gravity is

4960.48 --> 4963.678999999999
different

4961.679 --> 4965.04
it just means that the medium is

4963.679 --> 4968.2390000000005
different

4965.04 --> 4970.84
causing different types of relative

4968.239 --> 4972.718999999999
density disequilibrium

4970.84 --> 4975.6
displacement

4972.719 --> 4975.6
that's how it works

4979.84 --> 4983.679
sounds like guess what what the [ __ ] are

4981.76 --> 4984.84
you talking about dude

4983.679 --> 4988.96
it's not

4984.84 --> 4991.52
guesswork this is part of my profession

4988.96 --> 4993.84
this is like a really important work

4991.52 --> 4996.080000000001
it's not guess work i'm not guessing

4993.84 --> 4997.4400000000005
it's a very distinct system and it's

4996.08 --> 5000.239
compatible

4997.44 --> 5002.4
it's everybody that gets it really gets

5000.239 --> 5002.4
it

5003.04 --> 5007.84
and there is

5004.88 --> 5010.159000000001
an effective scientific method based

5007.84 --> 5014.0
proof for this it's very testable it

5010.159 --> 5018.159
always works out it is scientific

5014.0 --> 5018.159
density and buoyancy are scientific

5018.4 --> 5023.759999999999
unless you add on

5020.719 --> 5027.6
but it is all caused by gravity and that

5023.76 --> 5030.0
part would be just a graft on you can't

5027.6 --> 5032.320000000001
put that in a scientific experiment

5030.0 --> 5034.32
because you can't prove gravity

5032.32 --> 5037.5199999999995
yeah that's when it doesn't when it

5034.32 --> 5039.44
isn't scientific anymore

5037.52 --> 5042.4800000000005
but without

5039.44 --> 5045.36
the gravity suggestion it works the

5042.48 --> 5047.5199999999995
whole system of density buoyancy works

5045.36 --> 5049.04
that's what relative density effectively

5047.52 --> 5051.84
is

5049.04 --> 5053.84
it's not guess work

5051.84 --> 5058.0
it's a very distinct system i've

5053.84 --> 5061.52
explained it for all together maybe

5058.0 --> 5065.199
hundreds of hours of speaking time

5061.52 --> 5066.8
by now over like the last seven years

5065.199 --> 5068.799999999999
maybe more maybe it's like a thousand

5066.8 --> 5071.679
i've spoken so much about it i've

5068.8 --> 5074.719
explained it so many times

5071.679 --> 5078.159
over at fed alone with the guys like

5074.719 --> 5080.96
during live shows so many times

5078.159 --> 5083.759999999999
this is not guess work

5080.96 --> 5084.96
i have it in my mind it's a very precise

5083.76 --> 5087.360000000001
pattern

5084.96 --> 5090.639
and it works and it's has is

5087.36 --> 5093.44
scientifically founded

5090.639 --> 5094.400000000001
and it is effectively in textbooks

5093.44 --> 5097.28
already

5094.4 --> 5100.08
they just like to graft onto it a

5097.28 --> 5102.08
baseless assertion of gravity

5100.08 --> 5106.44
which makes it unscientific if you

5102.08 --> 5106.44
include that in the hypothesis

5107.0 --> 5115.679
[Music]

5112.48 --> 5118.5599999999995
weighing varying latitude other very

5115.679 --> 5119.36
that's not guess work oh flaws

5118.56 --> 5122.4800000000005
yeah

5119.36 --> 5124.239
that wasn't guesswork either

5122.48 --> 5127.12
about the difference in weight because i

5124.239 --> 5129.36
heard that before it's been discussed on

5127.12 --> 5132.96
fed many times

5129.36 --> 5137.839999999999
nathan has elaborately explained it in

5132.96 --> 5141.04
person on his show live many times

5137.84 --> 5144.159000000001
and so if i we discussed it like us too

5141.04 --> 5145.84
and like adam meekin

5144.159 --> 5147.12
we discussed it many this is not

5145.84 --> 5149.6
guesswork

5147.12 --> 5152.08
we heard the claim before

5149.6 --> 5155.1990000000005
was the acceleration different yeah it's

5152.08 --> 5156.08
because the medium is different exactly

5155.199 --> 5158.5599999999995
as

5156.08 --> 5159.28
the relative density model

5158.56 --> 5161.92
would

5159.28 --> 5164.5599999999995
yeah would be usable in the explanation

5161.92 --> 5167.6
to explain exactly why

5164.56 --> 5167.6
the apparent change

5167.84 --> 5171.28
it's testable

5169.199 --> 5174.5599999999995
you can literally mimic the conditions

5171.28 --> 5177.12
in the hyper-controlled laboratory

5174.56 --> 5181.4800000000005
to see whether that happens because of

5177.12 --> 5181.48
the conditions and it does

5191.28 --> 5194.28
um

5200.719 --> 5206.159
right the supposed weight measurement

5203.92 --> 5207.84
measurement

5206.159 --> 5210.4
is extremely

5207.84 --> 5213.52
small indifference anyway supposed at

5210.4 --> 5215.44
the different regions very very small

5213.52 --> 5218.080000000001
difference it's practically not

5215.44 --> 5218.08
significant

5218.32 --> 5220.719
but it's there

5219.6 --> 5222.4800000000005
right

5220.719 --> 5224.96
well

5222.48 --> 5227.199
the exact same type of readout

5224.96 --> 5231.12
differences happen

5227.199 --> 5233.36
in controlled simulation environments

5231.12 --> 5235.599999999999
where you would basically set up

5233.36 --> 5238.08
different types of temperature

5235.6 --> 5240.320000000001
gas content gas pressure within the

5238.08 --> 5243.679
controlled environment

5240.32 --> 5246.08
it will have the same type of readout

5243.679 --> 5248.639
variations

5246.08 --> 5250.88
the minor difference it will i promise

5248.639 --> 5254.56
you this try it out if you if you need

5250.88 --> 5256.2390000000005
to and it will do that because it is

5254.56 --> 5259.1990000000005
because of the relative density

5256.239 --> 5261.599999999999
conditions it's because of the different

5259.199 --> 5264.96
content pressure

5261.6 --> 5267.1990000000005
of the medium versus the object

5264.96 --> 5269.199
including when it isn't falling and

5267.199 --> 5270.799999999999
accelerating when it isn't actually in

5269.199 --> 5273.839999999999
motion but when

5270.8 --> 5276.320000000001
it's stopped from displacing within the

5273.84 --> 5276.32
medium

5276.48 --> 5282.718999999999
and then instead going to exert pressure

5280.48 --> 5285.839999999999
because it's still in this equilibrium

5282.719 --> 5288.4800000000005
with its surroundings right

5285.84 --> 5293.0
a rock when you put it on another rock

5288.48 --> 5293.0
is going to push against the other rock

5295.28 --> 5299.28
and it's going to effectively when you

5297.199 --> 5301.04
read that translate that into weight

5299.28 --> 5303.599999999999
through scale mechanisms it's going to

5301.04 --> 5305.199
read out more

5303.6 --> 5306.84
because it's the relative density

5305.199 --> 5308.5599999999995
disequilibrium

5306.84 --> 5309.4400000000005
pressure

5308.56 --> 5311.92
right

5309.44 --> 5315.28
if it's not physically obstructed

5311.92 --> 5315.28
it's going to accelerate

5315.76 --> 5320.08
until it is obstructed because yeah we

5317.92 --> 5322.0
can all bet that it will be at some

5320.08 --> 5324.48
point right except maybe for a helium

5322.0 --> 5326.0
balloon accelerating up

5324.48 --> 5327.839999999999
it's not going to reach that ceiling

5326.0 --> 5330.08
it's going to burst before it will do

5327.84 --> 5330.08
that

5332.4 --> 5336.638999999999
so physical objects tend to eventually

5335.28 --> 5338.239
reach

5336.639 --> 5341.36
the surface where they will be

5338.239 --> 5343.12
obstructed from accelerating

5341.36 --> 5344.88
because of the relative density this

5343.12 --> 5346.239
equilibrium but they will still

5344.88 --> 5349.76
effectively

5346.239 --> 5352.159
from all sides be surrounded an object

5349.76 --> 5354.56
by that medium it just can't accelerate

5352.159 --> 5355.679
further it's resting on the ground let's

5354.56 --> 5358.080000000001
say

5355.679 --> 5360.08
right but it's still in this equilibrium

5358.08 --> 5362.48
with that medium surrounds it unless

5360.08 --> 5363.36
that medium that surrounds it

5362.48 --> 5365.839999999999
is

5363.36 --> 5367.679
something that's very dense or equally

5365.84 --> 5369.52
as dense as

5367.679 --> 5372.2390000000005
the the object

5369.52 --> 5375.76
and then it might start suspend within

5372.239 --> 5377.599999999999
it because it has an equal density

5375.76 --> 5380.8
right like if it was a heavy liquid

5377.6 --> 5380.8
equal to like a rock

5382.56 --> 5386.96
it's gonna fall into it give a splash

5384.48 --> 5388.799999999999
and then it's gonna float pretty much in

5386.96 --> 5390.84
the middle because it has the same

5388.8 --> 5392.56
density as the medium

5390.84 --> 5394.719
then

5392.56 --> 5396.719
but yeah it doesn't happen a lot that

5394.719 --> 5398.08
sort of thing

5396.719 --> 5398.88
right

5398.08 --> 5401.679
not

5398.88 --> 5403.4400000000005
not all objects will find like a liquid

5401.679 --> 5406.56
medium or something that's going to be

5403.44 --> 5409.5199999999995
of the same density like heavy liquids

5406.56 --> 5412.56
tend to be kind of rare

5409.52 --> 5415.6
so usually objects end up

5412.56 --> 5417.360000000001
pushing against other solid matter while

5415.6 --> 5419.120000000001
still surrounded

5417.36 --> 5422.48
by a medium

5419.12 --> 5424.08
that's less because it's air

5422.48 --> 5426.48
so we'll be at permanent this

5424.08 --> 5430.32
equilibrium always pushing

5426.48 --> 5432.239
and we can size up that push

5430.32 --> 5434.0
using scales

5432.239 --> 5437.678999999999
and then it will be translated into a

5434.0 --> 5437.679
numerical value of weight

5442.719 --> 5448.84
right this is what i do

5445.28 --> 5448.84
that's how it works

5450.8 --> 5457.84
and i'm not here to provide you with

5453.12 --> 5457.84
[ __ ] calculator questions yeah dude

5457.92 --> 5464.2390000000005
go to a mathematician then yeah

5461.52 --> 5467.120000000001
i'm here to explain how it works not for

5464.239 --> 5468.638999999999
i'm not your personal [ __ ] calculator

5467.12 --> 5471.679
okay

5468.639 --> 5471.679
get away from me

5471.84 --> 5477.12
i'm not going to give you a formula just

5476.08 --> 5480.719
like that

5477.12 --> 5480.719
stop expecting that

5480.88 --> 5485.6
listen to what i have to say

5483.6 --> 5487.84
learn how it works you don't need a

5485.6 --> 5490.159000000001
[ __ ] formula

5487.84 --> 5493.679
you just need to know how it works and

5490.159 --> 5493.679
learn that it is consistent

5493.88 --> 5501.52
explanation precedes

5496.88 --> 5501.52
a mathematical pattern okay

5501.76 --> 5506.719
you can't turn everything into math

5504.719 --> 5509.52
always you need to stop doing that it's

5506.719 --> 5511.92
useless you're just gonna graft in more

5509.52 --> 5514.4800000000005
unproven fictional [ __ ] things like

5511.92 --> 5516.4800000000005
gravity

5514.48 --> 5517.599999999999
if you keep doing that you need to get

5516.48 --> 5519.919999999999
real

5517.6 --> 5521.1990000000005
you need to start explaining the

5519.92 --> 5523.1990000000005
substance

5521.199 --> 5525.12
not in math

5523.199 --> 5528.32
in explanation

5525.12 --> 5530.639
in observation

5528.32 --> 5534.32
that's how you really figure things out

5530.639 --> 5536.8
not by finding math formulas it doesn't

5534.32 --> 5536.799999999999
help you

5537.76 --> 5542.400000000001
[Music]

5539.76 --> 5546.8
the real side is not real scientific

5542.4 --> 5549.44
terms i'm describing it and i am using

5546.8 --> 5552.88
scientific terminologies correctly

5549.44 --> 5556.239
within my explanation all flaws

5552.88 --> 5556.2390000000005
who the [ __ ] you think you are

5559.76 --> 5563.360000000001
show me show me where i said something

5562.32 --> 5565.679
wrong

5563.36 --> 5568.159
like systemically wrong systemically

5565.679 --> 5570.159
incorrect not just a flub

5568.159 --> 5572.638999999999
said it's something use the wrong word

5570.159 --> 5575.679
or whatever

5572.639 --> 5577.04
where did i make an actual systemic

5575.679 --> 5578.159
mistake

5577.04 --> 5581.6
go

5578.159 --> 5583.599999999999
i'm gonna take a two minute break

5581.6 --> 5586.84
we'll see what you got i don't think you

5583.6 --> 5586.84
got anything

5601.84 --> 5603.92
you

5684.159 --> 5688.638999999999
said inside no i didn't say that you're

5686.639 --> 5690.8
putting words in my mouth

5688.639 --> 5694.32
guys did i say

5690.8 --> 5696.88
it's scientifically proven

5694.32 --> 5699.36
latter taught latitude is not the cause

5696.88 --> 5702.4800000000005
of the change of way

5699.36 --> 5705.36
no that's not what i said i said

5702.48 --> 5707.599999999999
it's proven

5705.36 --> 5709.759999999999
that it's not the case it didn't invoke

5707.6 --> 5711.6
science on that

5709.76 --> 5714.4800000000005
yeah

5711.6 --> 5716.400000000001
relative density is scientifically

5714.48 --> 5717.199
proven

5716.4 --> 5721.119
and

5717.199 --> 5723.599999999999
the effect that you ushered in

5721.119 --> 5724.4
can absolutely

5723.6 --> 5725.84
be

5724.4 --> 5728.719
figured out

5725.84 --> 5731.52
why it happens using relative density

5728.719 --> 5736.0
emulating the conditions okay

5731.52 --> 5737.92
i did not directly attribute science

5736.0 --> 5738.8
to that

5737.92 --> 5741.04
so

5738.8 --> 5742.96
you seem to be playing like word tricks

5741.04 --> 5743.92
on me i don't like that i don't like to

5742.96 --> 5745.28
be

5743.92 --> 5747.28
falsely

5745.28 --> 5748.8
like to have words falsely put in my

5747.28 --> 5752.0
mouth

5748.8 --> 5753.4400000000005
when the weight of those words are quite

5752.0 --> 5756.4
distinct

5753.44 --> 5759.199
within a discussion like this

5756.4 --> 5759.199
do you understand

5764.719 --> 5769.199
this

5765.84 --> 5770.4800000000005
look into the egg experiment

5769.199 --> 5774.0
right

5770.48 --> 5774.0
sleeping warrior channel

5774.8 --> 5780.2390000000005
he's done it many times it is proper

5777.84 --> 5784.0
science he has all

5780.239 --> 5786.4
every part of this hypothesis correct

5784.0 --> 5788.56
you can literally do it yourself

5786.4 --> 5790.0
you might not like it

5788.56 --> 5794.320000000001
it's real

5790.0 --> 5796.239
it's scientifically valid

5794.32 --> 5798.799999999999
you understand

5796.239 --> 5801.36
oh it's okay that's where you go goodbye

5798.8 --> 5804.400000000001
[ __ ] bye

5801.36 --> 5806.96
science denier

5804.4 --> 5811.28
fantasist scumbag

5806.96 --> 5813.84
anti-flat earther probably math addict

5811.28 --> 5813.84
bye

5826.18 --> 5830.859
[Music]

5836.48 --> 5842.638999999999
tell all flaws to unblock me well it's

5838.56 --> 5842.639
too late now he's out of here

5843.76 --> 5847.4800000000005
xing vexa

5849.07 --> 5852.21
[Music]

5855.73 --> 5858.839999999999
[Music]

5873.84 --> 5877.92
i have to defend their programming yeah

5878.0 --> 5883.199
well he expected probably that i

5880.08 --> 5885.92
wouldn't be able to provide anything

5883.199 --> 5887.5199999999995
so then he turned to at home he asked

5885.92 --> 5889.84
what's your evidence

5887.52 --> 5891.76
like assuming that i'm just laughing no

5889.84 --> 5895.119000000001
i'm not bluffing

5891.76 --> 5898.400000000001
this has all been worked out

5895.119 --> 5900.239
for years it's been a very serious

5898.4 --> 5904.799999999999
effort

5900.239 --> 5904.799999999999
successful effort yeah

5906.08 --> 5912.5599999999995
now not a successful effort to actually

5908.8 --> 5914.320000000001
make anti-flat earthers stop

5912.56 --> 5916.96
stop engaging with their programming to

5914.32 --> 5919.5199999999995
drop that that's not been successful

5916.96 --> 5922.719
but the actual scientific effort to

5919.52 --> 5927.6
establish the hypothesis

5922.719 --> 5931.28
successfully that has succeeded

5927.6 --> 5933.360000000001
we have found the solution

5931.28 --> 5936.159
relative density

5933.36 --> 5939.04
it has an experiment

5936.159 --> 5942.5599999999995
and a hypothesis and you could do it

5939.04 --> 5942.56
yourself it's very easy

5943.119 --> 5950.639
like this is actually an easy experiment

5947.36 --> 5952.639
right yeah the egg denier well you don't

5950.639 --> 5954.56
even need to use an egg it's just kind

5952.639 --> 5955.679
of like yeah a lot of people are going

5954.56 --> 5959.360000000001
to be

5955.679 --> 5961.4400000000005
able to get eggs to do it with like

5959.36 --> 5965.5199999999995
a glass of water

5961.44 --> 5968.0
like glass water salt egg

5965.52 --> 5969.6
those are things that

5968.0 --> 5971.679
pretty much

5969.6 --> 5974.4800000000005
you could get everywhere in the world

5971.679 --> 5977.6
see so that it is like a very easy to

5974.48 --> 5981.678999999999
assemble setup for an experiment

5977.6 --> 5984.88
literally any kid could do it

5981.679 --> 5984.88
as long as you have eggs

5985.04 --> 5989.199
everybody's gonna have a glass

5987.44 --> 5991.759999999999
most people

5989.199 --> 5994.0
like you gotta be like really

5991.76 --> 5997.360000000001
destituted out of your mind to not be

5994.0 --> 5997.36
able to do that experiment

6002.48 --> 6007.718999999999
that the buoyant force is a thing

6009.119 --> 6014.159
yeah it does right

6012.0 --> 6015.6
that's why that's why i said earlier

6014.159 --> 6017.599999999999
it's

6015.6 --> 6018.639
density and buoyancy that's what it's

6017.6 --> 6019.679
really

6018.639 --> 6020.719
about

6019.679 --> 6024.159
except

6020.719 --> 6028.88
relative density doesn't invoke gravity

6024.159 --> 6030.638999999999
graft that part on is the cause of it

6028.88 --> 6033.36
because it's the monster to be false

6030.639 --> 6033.36
when you do that

6034.08 --> 6038.88
you can't just graft

6036.48 --> 6041.119
gravity into a hypo scientific

6038.88 --> 6042.88
hypothesis you can't just graph a thing

6041.119 --> 6045.599999999999
that you're going to have to assume into

6042.88 --> 6047.76
a hypothesis that makes the hypothesis

6045.6 --> 6049.1990000000005
invalid

6047.76 --> 6051.52
yeah

6049.199 --> 6053.839999999999
but the density and buoyancy part yeah

6051.52 --> 6055.92
that's how it works

6053.84 --> 6059.360000000001
that's what actually happens it's just

6055.92 --> 6059.36
not caused by gravity

6059.679 --> 6063.679
can't just conjure that up and stick it

6061.92 --> 6068.36
on every time

6063.679 --> 6068.36
that makes it an invalid hypothesis

6076.44 --> 6079.599999999999
[Music]

6082.08 --> 6086.96
right and yeah

6084.32 --> 6088.08
in the relative density

6086.96 --> 6090.4800000000005
system

6088.08 --> 6094.639
the buoyant force as you call it or the

6090.48 --> 6094.638999999999
dense force that's all super cute

6094.88 --> 6099.1990000000005
those are relative density

6097.44 --> 6102.799999999999
disequilibrium

6099.199 --> 6104.96
force that's what it really is

6102.8 --> 6108.08
so this equilibrium between the object

6104.96 --> 6111.36
and the medium causes that force

6108.08 --> 6113.44
in a in a linear rape between the

6111.36 --> 6115.839999999999
density difference right it's directly

6113.44 --> 6117.759999999999
connected there's a spectrum of the

6115.84 --> 6121.84
amount of force

6117.76 --> 6121.84
that will come from this equilibrium

6126.0 --> 6131.28
right it's never going to be oh

6128.4 --> 6134.08
this time these two densities

6131.28 --> 6136.4
the differential it was different but it

6134.08 --> 6137.5199999999995
did the same no that's not going to

6136.4 --> 6140.159
happen

6137.52 --> 6142.719
it's always going to respond in linear

6140.159 --> 6142.719
fashion

6143.199 --> 6147.199
that's relative density this equilibrium

6145.44 --> 6148.799999999999
force

6147.199 --> 6151.199
up or down

6148.8 --> 6152.96
or neutralized right if the densities

6151.199 --> 6154.96
are equal there will be no differential

6152.96 --> 6156.4800000000005
and then there is no force to displace

6154.96 --> 6160.679
it

6156.48 --> 6160.678999999999
it will stay right where it is

6164.719 --> 6168.96
that's the mechanism it's how it works

6169.36 --> 6173.639
and it is scientifically founded

6180.48 --> 6185.04
the experiment doesn't

6182.88 --> 6186.4800000000005
disproves right it doesn't disprove

6185.04 --> 6188.48
gravity

6186.48 --> 6191.44
you can't disprove something that isn't

6188.48 --> 6195.599999999999
proven

6191.44 --> 6195.599999999999
yeah you don't have proof for gravity

6197.04 --> 6203.76
the relative density egg experiment

6200.8 --> 6206.2390000000005
is not to disprove gravity it proves how

6203.76 --> 6209.360000000001
relative density works

6206.239 --> 6212.239
that's what it proves it it ignores

6209.36 --> 6214.5599999999995
gravity as it should there is no

6212.239 --> 6216.0
scientific evidence for gravity and if

6214.56 --> 6217.4400000000005
you think there is

6216.0 --> 6220.56
why don't you go

6217.44 --> 6222.799999999999
join the flat earth debate discord

6220.56 --> 6223.679
and present some evidence

6222.8 --> 6226.639
yeah

6223.679 --> 6226.639
good luck with that

6227.119 --> 6231.759999999999
i mean we only inquire about that

6230.56 --> 6233.360000000001
every

6231.76 --> 6236.88
weekday

6233.36 --> 6241.599999999999
as long as nathan is having a live show

6236.88 --> 6241.6
for like the last five years or more

6242.96 --> 6247.199
seven years i don't know how it's so

6244.96 --> 6249.28
long now the housekeeping questions came

6247.199 --> 6251.36
a bit later so maybe like five four

6249.28 --> 6254.8
years i don't know a long time and

6251.36 --> 6254.799999999999
that's like every show so

6255.119 --> 6261.44
good luck proving your gravity hey if

6257.76 --> 6264.8
you deliver proof for your gravity and

6261.44 --> 6265.759999999999
everybody agrees that yeah that's proof

6264.8 --> 6267.1990000000005
then

6265.76 --> 6270.320000000001
i'll attempt

6267.199 --> 6272.239
to use relative density

6270.32 --> 6274.719
experiments

6272.239 --> 6277.678999999999
to try and disprove it yeah

6274.719 --> 6279.679
once you actually have satisfactory

6277.679 --> 6282.32
scientific evidence that's when i'll try

6279.679 --> 6284.639
to disprove it

6282.32 --> 6287.36
with relative density

6284.639 --> 6288.88
but currently there is no proof for

6287.36 --> 6291.44
gravity

6288.88 --> 6293.92
i don't need to address it

6291.44 --> 6298.36
within the experiment because it's not a

6293.92 --> 6298.36
factor it's not a provable factor

6304.719 --> 6308.36
everything is either

6317.52 --> 6319.84
ah

6320.8 --> 6323.84
either call this

6329.52 --> 6334.96
what does that mean it means

6332.56 --> 6338.0
it was just technobabble squirting

6334.96 --> 6338.0
that's what that means

6340.96 --> 6346.159
this describe properties of something

6343.199 --> 6348.08
that he can prove exist

6346.159 --> 6351.36
this literal magical thinking right

6348.08 --> 6355.119
there and you fell for it

6351.36 --> 6357.04
is a wizard juggling with phantom balls

6355.119 --> 6359.5199999999995
you're trying to find

6357.04 --> 6361.679
you're trying to envision the ball that

6359.52 --> 6362.719
he's juggling but it isn't actually

6361.679 --> 6365.84
there

6362.719 --> 6365.84
yeah that's what he's doing

6365.92 --> 6369.4
techno babble

6394.48 --> 6402.0
gill tara that sounds really don't say

6398.84 --> 6405.52
that i mean squirter is one thing but

6402.0 --> 6405.52
don't go there man

6406.08 --> 6409.639
that's just gross

6426.239 --> 6429.839999999999
could you please retract that

6462.0 --> 6466.4
yeah that's cool that he read could you

6463.76 --> 6469.400000000001
remove it from my chat now please terror

6466.4 --> 6469.4
306.

6472.8 --> 6479.719
that you remove it from my chat now

6476.4 --> 6479.719
thank you

6496.03 --> 6500.33
[Music]

6502.8 --> 6505.8
hmm

6538.0 --> 6547.4
oh my god

6541.04 --> 6547.4
i think it's gonna be a truly fed today

6564.719 --> 6569.92
auto tea drinking

6567.28 --> 6571.599
settle for back don't do that

6569.92 --> 6576.0
just green tea

6571.599 --> 6576.0
just regular organic green tea

6581.28 --> 6589.8
i'll cassand today

6584.56 --> 6589.8
now gusto i don't really want it

6598.56 --> 6601.599
hey tomorrow too

6603.679 --> 6608.719
yeah sock troll army always does arrive

6606.96 --> 6611.44
at the end of the show

6608.719 --> 6614.44
they kind of jump in here to warm up for

6611.44 --> 6614.44
nathan

6646.159 --> 6650.96
how big is this army i don't know that

6648.159 --> 6650.96
all depends on

6651.599 --> 6655.1990000000005
they were able to get out of bed and all

6653.92 --> 6657.36
that

6655.199 --> 6659.919999999999
right

6657.36 --> 6662.239
they couldn't help but just

6659.92 --> 6663.76
try to escape their miserable lives to

6662.239 --> 6667.839999999999
come here and just

6663.76 --> 6667.84
be annoying in our face

6682.719 --> 6688.44
no you're not being counted you're not

6684.56 --> 6688.4400000000005
that interesting toofer

6694.32 --> 6699.599
this is not about establishing your

6696.96 --> 6703.4800000000005
identity as a troll

6699.599 --> 6703.4800000000005
okay nobody cares

6709.119 --> 6713.679
all right and i'm gonna run out the show

6711.28 --> 6713.679
anyway

6717.36 --> 6719.679
right

6720.4 --> 6725.839999999999
so thanks everyone for coming

6723.04 --> 6728.8
i hope you liked this show

6725.84 --> 6730.88
that was pretty cool i had a lot of

6728.8 --> 6734.2390000000005
introspective stuff

6730.88 --> 6735.76
might watch it back again later

6734.239 --> 6740.0
right anyway

6735.76 --> 6742.159000000001
if yeah also lots of uh yeah flat earth

6740.0 --> 6744.8
rather physics mechanics relative

6742.159 --> 6746.638999999999
density gravity i went through the whole

6744.8 --> 6748.719
shebang

6746.639 --> 6750.88
hope you appreciated that

6748.719 --> 6753.44
i mean going through it it does help you

6750.88 --> 6755.4400000000005
understand like if it was very difficult

6753.44 --> 6757.598999999999
at first if you just go through it again

6755.44 --> 6760.879999999999
and again and again eventually
