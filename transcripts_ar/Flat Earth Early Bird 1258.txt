back to kind of clouded again

89.119 --> 92.88
and camera freezing of course

96.079 --> 102.79899999999999
my camera is really frosty these days

99.68 --> 105.52000000000001
but yeah as you can see

102.799 --> 108.24000000000001
big clouds

105.52 --> 109.84
wind and rain

108.24 --> 112.88
here and there

109.84 --> 115.04
i did manage to get through all this

112.88 --> 116.719
get grosser to get groceries without

115.04 --> 119.43900000000001
getting wet but

116.719 --> 121.83999999999999
i was just lucky because it's raining

119.439 --> 126.0
all the time

121.84 --> 126.0
so it's a wet day wet sunday

127.439 --> 130.959
still

128.72 --> 133.44
the air is kind of nice and fresh i do

130.959 --> 133.44
like that

136.16 --> 141.16
a bit cooler

137.76 --> 141.16
washed air

142.319 --> 147.51999999999998
breathes much better

145.2 --> 147.51999999999998
right

153.36 --> 159.28
hello crockett first in chat john 925

157.92 --> 163.11999999999998
elise g

159.28 --> 166.8
pjc net psych bear good see you all

163.12 --> 166.8
i am starting a bit late today

168.72 --> 173.519
but

171.36 --> 175.59900000000002
i was just

173.519 --> 177.59900000000002
dreaming

175.599 --> 178.959
yeah i actually i was listening to the

177.599 --> 182.23899999999998
blueberry

178.959 --> 184.56
menu song for a while it it is really

182.239 --> 187.519
very dreamy

184.56 --> 189.68
reflecting back um well the movie and

187.519 --> 192.56
what we talked about

189.68 --> 194.72
and also a bit on

192.56 --> 199.08
my last hangout with jim bob apparently

194.72 --> 199.08
this guy that we went up against

199.44 --> 201.76
like

200.4 --> 205.04
was really

201.76 --> 207.76
butthurt over it and made like a

205.04 --> 209.2
what is it almost two hour video in

207.76 --> 211.51899999999998
response where he was basically

209.2 --> 214.319
projecting everything

211.519 --> 214.31900000000002
on g bob

217.36 --> 221.519
quite hysterical

219.12 --> 226.92000000000002
the wizard is never late

221.519 --> 226.92000000000002
right i arrive exactly when i intend to

232.319 --> 237.28
no but i did actually just decide to

234.64 --> 239.27999999999997
take my time i could have started i just

237.28 --> 241.36
was like no

239.28 --> 244.0
i'll probably just be kind of staring at

241.36 --> 246.87900000000002
the screen for like

244.0 --> 246.879
20 minutes

247.519 --> 251.519
so i did kind of like pre-focus

251.84 --> 254.84
uh

255.49 --> 261.56
[Music]

257.68 --> 261.56
so how are you all doing

273.31 --> 276.439
[Music]

277.52 --> 280.84
been watching

282.16 --> 287.44
oh benjamin also

284.96 --> 288.479
he's now he's now just doing weekend

287.44 --> 290.24
streams

288.479 --> 293.12
i i guess that he's

290.24 --> 295.36
like abandoned the the no weekend

293.12 --> 298.8
streaming policy now

295.36 --> 298.8
he's just doing it anyway

306.16 --> 311.36
right so he did bring up something that

309.039 --> 314.15999999999997
was noteworthy and i think he's just

311.36 --> 315.199
barting around probably

314.16 --> 318.16
but

315.199 --> 320.16
he didn't mention like oh i don't think

318.16 --> 321.12
entropy is real

320.16 --> 323.44
i think

321.12 --> 324.479
things actually start ordering

323.44 --> 327.84
themselves

324.479 --> 327.84
it's just like oh god

327.919 --> 330.32
really

334.24 --> 339.479
basically reifying well

336.84 --> 342.479
resonance right things resonate

339.479 --> 343.75899999999996
crystallization synchronicities it's all

342.479 --> 346.15999999999997
resonance

343.759 --> 350.47900000000004
but that's separate from entropy though

346.16 --> 351.6
because over time it will all indeed

350.479 --> 354.15999999999997
basically

351.6 --> 354.16
crumble

355.919 --> 358.15999999999997
uh

358.72 --> 363.44000000000005
i wonder if he's gonna well do that

361.12 --> 363.44
again

363.759 --> 366.759
anyway

370.72 --> 375.16
so what have you guys been up to

396.56 --> 401.68
is that from this world

399.36 --> 403.91900000000004
no it's not from disc world

401.68 --> 406.639
matthew hall come on

403.919 --> 409.639
it's from lord of the rings

406.639 --> 409.639
gandalf

426.02 --> 429.06
[Music]

432.47 --> 435.92900000000003
[Music]

448.72 --> 451.72
hmm

463.759 --> 470.08000000000004
sunday's a slow day my brain isn't fully

465.919 --> 470.08
in gear yet alright fair enough

471.919 --> 476.52
but i am starting very late though

476.9 --> 480.87899999999996
[Music]

478.4 --> 483.19899999999996
i mean i got a bit of the same problem

480.879 --> 485.36
although i did go to bed really early i

483.199 --> 490.28000000000003
am going to bed really early these days

485.36 --> 490.28000000000003
and i'm liking it i'm liking it a lot

492.4 --> 496.0
it

493.759 --> 497.68
tends to

496.0 --> 501.72
make me

497.68 --> 501.72
dream a lot in the morning

504.1 --> 508.089
[Music]

509.12 --> 513.36
right and there's really nothing out

511.199 --> 516.64
there anyway that's really that

513.36 --> 518.479
important to keep up for anyway

516.64 --> 519.68
right the only thing that really keeps

518.479 --> 521.6800000000001
me up

519.68 --> 524.399
when i do that is just my inner

521.68 --> 527.76
restlessness and just me trying to like

524.399 --> 530.399
seek distraction pure escapism

527.76 --> 533.76
it's never like oh this is so

530.399 --> 535.76
oh i gotta learn about this now

533.76 --> 537.519
even though it's late now that just

535.76 --> 541.36
never really happens if something like

537.519 --> 543.839
that actually if i do bump into it late

541.36 --> 545.6
i just immediately okay i'm gonna make a

543.839 --> 546.8000000000001
note of that

545.6 --> 549.6800000000001
and i'll wait

546.8 --> 551.92
until i'm a little bit fresher

549.68 --> 551.92
so

552.32 --> 557.6800000000001
so yeah overall

554.959 --> 562.04
just pragmatic conclusion is

557.68 --> 562.04
going to bed earlier is better

562.32 --> 566.08
but yeah if i'm restless and restless

566.64 --> 572.6
does typically happen around the full

569.04 --> 572.5999999999999
moon and all that

573.96 --> 588.26
[Music]

592.0 --> 598.24
a funny coincidence a bit

594.64 --> 600.88
it's not really it's very contemporary

598.24 --> 603.36
was that when i went out for groceries i

600.88 --> 603.36
went to

603.76 --> 608.88
three places

606.48 --> 611.519
and in all of them i basically ended up

608.88 --> 612.56
having a conversation like

611.519 --> 615.279
pretty

612.56 --> 616.4799999999999
good and nice conversation small ones

615.279 --> 618.56
but

616.48 --> 620.9590000000001
with nice girls

618.56 --> 623.5189999999999
wait i went to four places

620.959 --> 625.04
one of them wasn't in a very great mood

623.519 --> 628.48
or anything

625.04 --> 631.4399999999999
but yeah four girls at the counter

628.48 --> 634.24
and three of them were actually like

631.44 --> 636.8800000000001
two i don't remember really knowing

634.24 --> 638.32
having seen before

636.88 --> 640.8
because one place i don't really go

638.32 --> 643.44
there that often

640.8 --> 647.16
they were all like really nice and

643.44 --> 647.1600000000001
it just like

652.48 --> 657.44
it's good to be facing just some really

655.279 --> 660.8
nice girls that just give me hope like

657.44 --> 664.1600000000001
well maybe

660.8 --> 667.68
if that's out there then maybe i will

664.16 --> 670.399
at some point be able to just

667.68 --> 673.04
go for it again

670.399 --> 674.959
because often you know when i

673.04 --> 676.64
talking here and i'm talking about like

674.959 --> 678.8
the crazy things in the world and the

676.64 --> 680.88
psychological warfare i become like kind

678.8 --> 682.959
of pessimistic

680.88 --> 685.519
just all i just start assuming like

682.959 --> 686.8389999999999
everybody is [ __ ] for letting this

685.519 --> 689.6
all

686.839 --> 693.2
happen and even more when they go along

689.6 --> 693.2
with it but in reality it is

693.6 --> 698.9590000000001
there's still a lot of potential that's

695.76 --> 701.76
kind of dormant everywhere in people

698.959 --> 704.2399999999999
and i see that now i like really see it

701.76 --> 706.959
it's like i'm looking at somebody

704.24 --> 710.0790000000001
there's connections whether they're like

706.959 --> 710.079
conscious of it or not

710.639 --> 715.6800000000001
but when i see more they often also make

713.839 --> 718.0
more connection than their kind of

715.68 --> 721.4399999999999
interest in looking at me and we have

718.0 --> 723.36
eye contact naturally it's like

721.44 --> 724.8000000000001
boom

723.36 --> 727.36
so much

724.8 --> 727.3599999999999
dormant

728.839 --> 734.0790000000001
potential it's the hazards of being a an

731.68 --> 737.12
arwyn i guess

734.079 --> 740.8
it's not really a hazard it is great

737.12 --> 740.8
but it is sometimes like what

742.24 --> 747.839
what do you do when everything is just

744.8 --> 747.8389999999999
full of potential

750.24 --> 756.24
right because are you just gonna start

753.12 --> 758.8
making moves doing things because then

756.24 --> 761.6
you're counting on that potential that

758.8 --> 765.279
you face from being there in order for

761.6 --> 768.639
it to work on a spiritual mechanical way

765.279 --> 772.68
but if you make moves it also changes

768.639 --> 772.6800000000001
people that are involved

775.279 --> 780.48
and because of that i've become very

777.68 --> 782.0
hesitant to basically see something with

780.48 --> 784.48
potential

782.0 --> 788.639
start envisioning dreams as to what i

784.48 --> 791.2
can do with it and then going for it

788.639 --> 793.6800000000001
because i just know

791.2 --> 796.0
from experience that the end result is

793.68 --> 798.16
never going to be like the start

796.0 --> 799.6
so it would you would have to end up

798.16 --> 801.6
with something that's going to be worth

799.6 --> 805.76
it not just

801.6 --> 805.76
in remembrance of the star anyway

812.8 --> 817.68
we just spread out

814.88 --> 819.519
now but even a lot of [ __ ] people

817.68 --> 822.56
are actually kind of

819.519 --> 825.279
awesome they just get stuck in a wrong

822.56 --> 827.04
rail track

825.279 --> 830.24
right and then they're even like could

827.04 --> 831.92
be protect it can go all wrong right

830.24 --> 833.839
they're on a wrong rail track and they

831.92 --> 836.959
don't realize that they're they're just

833.839 --> 836.9590000000001
getting too defensive

839.519 --> 846.9590000000001
but yes there are some that are like

842.88 --> 849.519
really making their stubbornness and

846.959 --> 851.92
and their inability to

849.519 --> 855.36
see through their incorrectness to make

851.92 --> 855.36
it other people's problem

855.519 --> 860.16
those are like what we genuinely think

858.32 --> 861.6
end up thinking as

860.16 --> 862.959
retards

861.6 --> 865.0400000000001
that's

862.959 --> 867.1199999999999
because everybody gets kind of [ __ ]

865.04 --> 868.639
at times everybody

867.12 --> 871.04
no exception

868.639 --> 872.399
but it's the ones that like never let it

871.04 --> 874.56
go

872.399 --> 876.639
right that always have to

874.56 --> 880.399
hit that low level those are the ones

876.639 --> 883.199
that are are truly [ __ ]

880.399 --> 885.839
and [ __ ] is now very colloquial word

883.199 --> 889.279
as i'm using it

885.839 --> 889.2790000000001
it's not clinical

891.04 --> 893.519
anyways

893.58 --> 901.639
[Music]

895.76 --> 901.639
hey slow mo moon buggy next to you

904.2 --> 907.3290000000001
[Music]

948.32 --> 953.089
[Music]

955.199 --> 960.4
write a post about a sun simulator and

957.92 --> 963.52
moon simulator okay

960.4 --> 963.52
[Music]

969.04 --> 972.7199999999999
what like a planetarium

974.8 --> 982.9689999999999
hey tony whitcomb

978.14 --> 982.9689999999999
[Music]

997.28 --> 1005.129
[Music]

1009.44 --> 1013.6800000000001
right yeah slow mo moon buggy if there's

1011.36 --> 1015.839
going to be some kind of a mechanism

1013.68 --> 1017.4399999999999
that guides the celestials and the sun

1015.839 --> 1022.36
and the moon it's not going to be in

1017.44 --> 1022.36
this regular 3d dimension

1026.559 --> 1030.16
and i do believe

1030.959 --> 1037.52
that there is such a thing

1034.079 --> 1040.72
but it's just not physically here it's

1037.52 --> 1040.72
in the sixth dimension

1042.799 --> 1045.12
anyway

1049.44 --> 1055.0
this uh government that's the sun and

1051.52 --> 1055.0
moon okay

1072.88 --> 1076.24
yeah that makes very little sense to me

1075.039 --> 1078.96
i mean

1076.24 --> 1079.76
if they actually had something like that

1078.96 --> 1080.96
well

1079.76 --> 1082.96
you would

1080.96 --> 1085.28
notice

1082.96 --> 1085.28
huh

1086.559 --> 1090.24
that would be

1088.16 --> 1091.679
like actual

1090.24 --> 1093.76
widespread

1091.679 --> 1095.76
video probably about like oh yeah we're

1093.76 --> 1098.96
testing the sun simulator look now

1095.76 --> 1101.36
there's another sun over there

1098.96 --> 1104.48
and everybody's just like uh filming

1101.36 --> 1105.6
around zooming and zooming out and

1104.48 --> 1108.6
whatever

1105.6 --> 1108.6
right

1109.12 --> 1114.3999999999999
plenty of live witnesses

1111.679 --> 1115.52
sounds just like another story [ __ ]

1114.4 --> 1117.52
it's like

1115.52 --> 1119.28
trying to make you presuppose that the

1117.52 --> 1120.72
government is in control that they

1119.28 --> 1124.48
actually have the keys to the

1120.72 --> 1127.44
holographic celestials oh really

1124.48 --> 1127.44
sure they do

1129.679 --> 1136.64
i mean don't show any evidence for that

1133.36 --> 1139.769
spread the rumors

1136.64 --> 1139.769
[Music]

1142.64 --> 1145.679
bioluminescence at work in the forest at

1144.72 --> 1148.0
night

1145.679 --> 1148.0
okay

1148.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
like fireflies

1153.679 --> 1159.76
it's a few artificial suns it's not in

1156.32 --> 1159.76
the sky yeah no [ __ ]

1163.679 --> 1169.679
so it's not a celestial simulator let's

1167.12 --> 1172.0
see it's oh just oh like make it as

1169.679 --> 1174.48
fuzzy as possible so everybody can get

1172.0 --> 1178.96
confused and start to squirt because oh

1174.48 --> 1182.72
my god the government the government

1178.96 --> 1186.48
the government has the simulator keys

1182.72 --> 1190.16
they always had it they just fool us oh

1186.48 --> 1192.48
scourge court yeah i'm sorry

1190.16 --> 1195.1200000000001
i'm not gonna fall for that it's a

1192.48 --> 1197.44
really trip it's a really cheap trick

1195.12 --> 1197.4399999999998
really

1205.76 --> 1211.2
right and this is just

1208.08 --> 1213.6
basically it sounds like agencies just

1211.2 --> 1215.76
making up stories for government to

1213.6 --> 1218.7199999999998
claim

1215.76 --> 1221.679
futuristic powers

1218.72 --> 1224.08
based on the contemporary

1221.679 --> 1226.0800000000002
situation where people are starting to

1224.08 --> 1228.72
see through a whole bunch of nonsense in

1226.08 --> 1230.6399999999999
the past so now their fantasy are kind

1228.72 --> 1232.64
of like ripe

1230.64 --> 1234.7990000000002
for the picking

1232.64 --> 1236.0800000000002
and then the government or the

1234.799 --> 1238.72
government

1236.08 --> 1241.6
people that specialize in doing that in

1238.72 --> 1243.1200000000001
like creating new stories

1241.6 --> 1243.9189999999999
play into that

1243.12 --> 1246.1589999999999
by

1243.919 --> 1249.76
yeah making claims

1246.159 --> 1251.1200000000001
like oh we had this power all along

1249.76 --> 1253.76
right

1251.12 --> 1254.559
it's a trick

1253.76 --> 1257.76
it's

1254.559 --> 1257.76
it's conjuration

1258.72 --> 1263.76
it just make you believe

1261.28 --> 1266.6399999999999
that oh oh look at all these amazing new

1263.76 --> 1268.799
revelations that you probably found out

1266.64 --> 1270.88
somewhere recently

1268.799 --> 1272.8799999999999
yeah that's all the government the

1270.88 --> 1278.72
government had all this power all the

1272.88 --> 1280.3200000000002
time huh huh so fall back in line now

1278.72 --> 1283.039
right

1280.32 --> 1283.039
that's a trick

1283.84 --> 1287.84
it's futurism it's a yeah

1289.039 --> 1295.72
it's it's like what the what priests

1291.919 --> 1295.72
in power do

1299.46 --> 1302.519
[Music]

1307.29 --> 1312.28
[Music]

1309.28 --> 1312.28
okay

1325.84 --> 1328.84
uh

1332.04 --> 1342.039
[Music]

1339.039 --> 1342.039
um

1342.52 --> 1345.66
[Music]

1361.7 --> 1364.779
[Music]

1373.12 --> 1376.32
right so yeah

1377.52 --> 1382.1589999999999
i'll i'll check out a sun simulator when

1380.48 --> 1384.799
i see it

1382.159 --> 1386.64
it's all just sci-fi stories and they've

1384.799 --> 1389.28
been going around guys

1386.64 --> 1390.88
like

1389.28 --> 1393.12
for a while

1390.88 --> 1394.159
over a decade i'd say

1393.12 --> 1396.8799999999999
rumors

1394.159 --> 1399.5200000000002
of they have some simulators that's a

1396.88 --> 1401.3600000000001
rumor that i've heard at least 10 years

1399.52 --> 1404.559
ago maybe more

1401.36 --> 1409.84
it could maybe even be like

1404.559 --> 1409.84
24 years ago no wait 14 years ago

1411.76 --> 1414.96
since i first heard that

1415.039 --> 1421.12
all right so that's all super cute

1418.48 --> 1423.6
right you could it's

1421.12 --> 1425.039
it's almost logical

1423.6 --> 1428.1589999999999
right

1425.039 --> 1430.559
that such a rumor would exist it is

1428.159 --> 1433.44
something that people would naturally

1430.559 --> 1435.76
fall into that conclusion as soon as

1433.44 --> 1437.679
they figure out that heliocentrism is a

1435.76 --> 1440.64
[ __ ] story

1437.679 --> 1444.679
and that well like i like to say

1440.64 --> 1444.679
celestial lights are holographic

1445.279 --> 1451.12
right i study that

1448.4 --> 1452.5590000000002
so if you then like what

1451.12 --> 1455.12
they're not

1452.559 --> 1458.48
balls in the distance and whoa so

1455.12 --> 1460.799
they're like a hologram well who's in

1458.48 --> 1463.039
control of the hologram guess what

1460.799 --> 1465.2
little grabber in a suit

1463.039 --> 1466.32
with a briefcase comes in

1465.2 --> 1469.1200000000001
yeah

1466.32 --> 1471.6
uh we're the government we knew it was

1469.12 --> 1473.84
holographic we have a machine to control

1471.6 --> 1473.84
that

1475.96 --> 1479.6000000000001
[Music]

1477.279 --> 1479.6
i mean

1480.32 --> 1486.4399999999998
why wouldn't they do that

1483.44 --> 1486.44
right

1488.4 --> 1491.4
um

1493.61 --> 1501.24
[Music]

1501.52 --> 1508.48
swipe you on alien abduction well i've

1504.4 --> 1508.48
addressed this some time ago also

1510.32 --> 1514.559
it's mostly mk ultra

1512.64 --> 1515.3600000000001
situations

1514.559 --> 1518.0
what

1515.36 --> 1520.08
colloquial by now would be seen as mk

1518.0 --> 1521.679
ultra it's not all very specifically

1520.08 --> 1523.76
that but

1521.679 --> 1524.88
it is drug related

1523.76 --> 1528.1589999999999
i've had

1524.88 --> 1530.4
first or second hand experience

1528.159 --> 1533.3600000000001
interviewing people that claim to have

1530.4 --> 1536.4
go on regular trips with aliens

1533.36 --> 1538.7199999999998
i asked them to describe exactly step by

1536.4 --> 1542.159
step how their experience was

1538.72 --> 1544.24
and immediately came to the conclusion

1542.159 --> 1548.159
it was drug induced they didn't realize

1544.24 --> 1548.159
it wasn't actually physical it was

1548.64 --> 1553.5200000000002
like hallucinatory

1551.52 --> 1557.679
partially probably hallucinatory

1553.52 --> 1560.1589999999999
potentially even completely out of body

1557.679 --> 1562.4
but they literally had no [ __ ] idea

1560.159 --> 1563.6000000000001
what they were doing right and i think

1562.4 --> 1565.76
that

1563.6 --> 1569.039
people that re that get caught up in

1565.76 --> 1572.24
such type of experience and they really

1569.039 --> 1575.279
have no bloody idea what it is

1572.24 --> 1576.72
they're very easily

1575.279 --> 1578.799
goaded

1576.72 --> 1581.52
without even realizing it

1578.799 --> 1583.679
into like making it about aliens

1581.52 --> 1587.44
especially back then because it was like

1583.679 --> 1589.44
oh people want to now listen to you

1587.44 --> 1593.44
crazy rambling man

1589.44 --> 1593.44
because you have a story about aliens

1594.08 --> 1596.799
right

1595.2 --> 1599.76
so i think a lot of it is like

1596.799 --> 1602.559
hallucinatory experiences

1599.76 --> 1603.76
and some are

1602.559 --> 1606.24
weirder

1603.76 --> 1608.48
some are people that probably were like

1606.24 --> 1609.679
drug addicts they were probably just

1608.48 --> 1611.3600000000001
like

1609.679 --> 1613.52
abducted they might not even have

1611.36 --> 1615.1999999999998
realized in the middle of a drug trip

1613.52 --> 1617.12
then they do [ __ ] with them they

1615.2 --> 1620.64
basically test it

1617.12 --> 1620.6399999999999
test things that are like

1621.36 --> 1628.3999999999999
it could even be fake like fake implants

1624.559 --> 1630.96
just to make a person go wild

1628.4 --> 1634.799
it wouldn't actually do anything right

1630.96 --> 1635.6000000000001
that's potentially possible

1634.799 --> 1638.32
so

1635.6 --> 1640.32
there was all kind of [ __ ] going on

1638.32 --> 1642.8799999999999
and i think that some people have been

1640.32 --> 1644.6399999999999
abducted and probably have had implants

1642.88 --> 1648.64
either for like

1644.64 --> 1650.5590000000002
in intelligence spying purposes or mk

1648.64 --> 1652.8400000000001
ultra

1650.559 --> 1656.1589999999999
like weaponized

1652.84 --> 1656.1589999999999
psychology or

1657.44 --> 1662.3200000000002
just pragmatic reasons

1659.52 --> 1665.039
but also for just testing to see like

1662.32 --> 1667.039
what will the people imagine in response

1665.039 --> 1670.24
to something happening to them when they

1667.039 --> 1672.8799999999999
don't realize what's really happening

1670.24 --> 1674.32
just pure psychological testing of like

1672.88 --> 1677.2
spiritual

1674.32 --> 1679.36
and like hallucinatory related responses

1677.2 --> 1681.3600000000001
to kind of map how that works

1679.36 --> 1683.1999999999998
i think that's what has been happening

1681.36 --> 1685.1999999999998
and that's what roughly is associated

1683.2 --> 1688.0
with alien abductions

1685.2 --> 1690.64
but most of it is just people

1688.0 --> 1693.039
basically tripping

1690.64 --> 1693.039
and then

1693.12 --> 1699.52
yeah conveying with entities now

1697.039 --> 1702.48
how they see these entities

1699.52 --> 1704.559
is interesting

1702.48 --> 1706.88
right will they look like the grey

1704.559 --> 1708.0
aliens or will they look like nordics or

1706.88 --> 1711.44
will they

1708.0 --> 1713.52
look like people they know

1711.44 --> 1716.64
like face changes like there's all kinds

1713.52 --> 1720.399
of things on the other side that

1716.64 --> 1724.3200000000002
well people end up dealing with

1720.399 --> 1726.08
right i've had that in my 80 80-year

1724.32 --> 1729.6
experience

1726.08 --> 1729.6
wasn't a pleasant experience

1731.2 --> 1735.3600000000001
and they were reflections of people i

1733.36 --> 1736.6399999999999
knew

1735.36 --> 1739.12
but

1736.64 --> 1742.96
it seemed like it was a struggle really

1739.12 --> 1742.9599999999998
overall in all that time about

1743.2 --> 1746.96
were they

1744.32 --> 1752.12
my agents

1746.96 --> 1752.1200000000001
or were they the agents of the outside

1752.559 --> 1755.279
and

1754.0 --> 1758.559
like

1755.279 --> 1760.64
through honor and logos in a very

1758.559 --> 1763.36
cryptic ways

1760.64 --> 1765.1200000000001
this is very

1763.36 --> 1769.1999999999998
inexplicable

1765.12 --> 1771.279
like get control it's and that's also it

1769.2 --> 1773.76
would reflect perfectly

1771.279 --> 1775.679
that experience again as that's why i

1773.76 --> 1778.48
say it is like a holographic

1775.679 --> 1780.64
representation of an internal experience

1778.48 --> 1781.84
like a dream that's manifesting like a

1780.64 --> 1784.3200000000002
holodeck

1781.84 --> 1786.24
and i think that those figures were my

1784.32 --> 1789.6
subconscious

1786.24 --> 1794.159
were was i going to let the subconscious

1789.6 --> 1797.52
be under control of the outside

1794.159 --> 1797.5200000000002
or of my conscious

1800.96 --> 1805.039
oh godzilla you got permission

1805.679 --> 1809.039
yeah

1806.88 --> 1812.44
say thanks to your wife for me and i'll

1809.039 --> 1812.44
check my paypal

1834.84 --> 1837.52
oh

1836.559 --> 1840.0
ah

1837.52 --> 1841.84
yeah thank you thank you very much for

1840.0 --> 1844.96
the paypal donation i really appreciate

1841.84 --> 1844.9599999999998
that i really need it

1845.039 --> 1849.279
and i don't want to be

1847.6 --> 1852.1589999999999
angry

1849.279 --> 1854.48
but i do really need it

1852.159 --> 1856.48
but i want to use my energy and momentum

1854.48 --> 1858.48
to

1856.48 --> 1860.159
not be angry and instead

1858.48 --> 1862.64
be better

1860.159 --> 1866.72
and hopefully

1862.64 --> 1866.72
the universe will sort itself out

1875.039 --> 1883.36
finally promoted on programming box he

1878.08 --> 1883.36
means to prescribe results aliens yes

1885.039 --> 1889.919
well i see mk ultra and all the alien

1887.76 --> 1894.48
abduction stuff

1889.919 --> 1895.44
like an attempt from well secret service

1894.48 --> 1897.679
groups

1895.44 --> 1901.039
occult groups potentially

1897.679 --> 1901.039
to try and map

1901.12 --> 1905.32
the internal dream world

1906.24 --> 1908.559
and

1907.519 --> 1911.36
yeah

1908.559 --> 1912.48
that's what they did and like adapted to

1911.36 --> 1915.279
the new

1912.48 --> 1918.48
arriving age basically in that sense

1915.279 --> 1921.279
also testing out the programming that

1918.48 --> 1922.559
has been rolling in like in the last

1921.279 --> 1924.159
century

1922.559 --> 1926.32
then

1924.159 --> 1927.679
and that has changed the way we dream

1926.32 --> 1930.559
and think

1927.679 --> 1932.64
right you kind of need to remap how

1930.559 --> 1935.279
people's dream world are if you want to

1932.64 --> 1937.519
have a cohesive system for that

1935.279 --> 1940.399
that's what i think they did

1937.519 --> 1943.919
that's what i think mk ultra and alien

1940.399 --> 1943.9189999999999
abduction situations

1944.24 --> 1949.1200000000001
have been for

1946.08 --> 1951.84
why the secret services were involved

1949.12 --> 1956.08
because they were mapping

1951.84 --> 1956.08
the the dream world of people in

1956.64 --> 1963.279
in this current age

1959.84 --> 1966.08
hope that answers your question

1963.279 --> 1968.72
if you had any

1966.08 --> 1968.72
let me check

1968.96 --> 1975.24

[Music]

2003.919 --> 2007.1000000000001
oh tony whitcomb you too

2006.08 --> 2009.039
thank you

2007.1 --> 2011.039
[Music]

2009.039 --> 2012.48
i don't like it when you all pile on

2011.039 --> 2016.36
like that

2012.48 --> 2016.3600000000001
financially that is

2021.44 --> 2025.3600000000001
whoa

2022.399 --> 2028.84
dude a little

2025.36 --> 2028.84
my god

2032.559 --> 2037.12
i think you were probably

2034.72 --> 2039.3600000000001
saying it like that on purpose

2037.12 --> 2041.4399999999998
thank you very much for a very sizable

2039.36 --> 2043.76
paypal donation

2041.44 --> 2047.48
that's very helpful

2043.76 --> 2047.48
very helpful indeed

2062.72 --> 2066.72
psychic abduction of the mind okay

2065.599 --> 2069.52
no

2066.72 --> 2073.04
i haven't said that there is any psychic

2069.52 --> 2074.96
or even psionic or telepath telepathic

2073.04 --> 2077.119
abilities involved

2074.96 --> 2080.2400000000002
in the research it is

2077.119 --> 2082.48
drugs are involved psychedelic drugs

2080.24 --> 2087.0
and

2082.48 --> 2087.0
studying just studying

2088.079 --> 2092.48
what they observed they they probably

2090.159 --> 2095.2000000000003
had a whole bunch of like

2092.48 --> 2097.119
kind of like artist types

2095.2 --> 2098.56
that were also druggies

2097.119 --> 2102.0
a bit

2098.56 --> 2105.2
and just like give them missions

2102.0 --> 2107.119
like okay take these drugs and imagine

2105.2 --> 2109.2
this doing all this

2107.119 --> 2111.839
like try to conjure that as you're doing

2109.2 --> 2113.9199999999996
it and then report back and like draw

2111.839 --> 2117.599
what you get to see right i think that

2113.92 --> 2120.0
they did probably like effectively

2117.599 --> 2122.8
a sort of role-playing exercise with

2120.0 --> 2126.64
heavy psychedelics i think that that is

2122.8 --> 2126.6400000000003
probably what they studied most with

2128.64 --> 2132.4
just

2129.599 --> 2133.44
role-playing they give you missions they

2132.4 --> 2135.04
study

2133.44 --> 2136.7200000000003
they already have framework of like

2135.04 --> 2140.24
what's gonna happen with these drugs and

2136.72 --> 2140.24
then they just like try to

2140.72 --> 2145.0
control the dream

2146.88 --> 2151.2000000000003
and make it predictable and then like

2149.2 --> 2154.3999999999996
figure out like how the mind works and

2151.2 --> 2154.3999999999996
all that right

2156.079 --> 2160.96
so it's not psychic

2158.96 --> 2162.079
it's psychedelic

2160.96 --> 2164.7
for sure

2162.079 --> 2167.82
it seems to be very key component

2164.7 --> 2167.8199999999997
[Music]

2175.44 --> 2180.8
right and they probably also did try

2178.0 --> 2183.839
that they did try to like get some of

2180.8 --> 2186.96
those people to basically try and exert

2183.839 --> 2189.04
like mind powers and all these things

2186.96 --> 2191.44
and naturally that would have gotten all

2189.04 --> 2193.7599999999998
these people that actually do that that

2191.44 --> 2196.4
did try those things it would get them

2193.76 --> 2198.6400000000003
into severe trouble karmically

2196.4 --> 2198.64
because

2199.119 --> 2204.2400000000002
you're not supposed to use your powers

2201.44 --> 2207.2000000000003
for destruction and

2204.24 --> 2209.2
and like if it gets fuel if an ability

2207.2 --> 2210.24
arises that is fueled by greed it

2209.2 --> 2212.7999999999997
literally

2210.24 --> 2213.68
corrupts greater power of fear

2212.8 --> 2216.2400000000002
right

2213.68 --> 2219.2799999999997
so all these people

2216.24 --> 2222.4799999999996
probably all died that were like used in

2219.28 --> 2222.48
the very serious

2222.64 --> 2228.24
like psi more psychic studies

2226.0 --> 2230.64
because they were just being used like

2228.24 --> 2233.68
lab rats effectively

2230.64 --> 2235.2
invoking like unleashing powers without

2233.68 --> 2238.0789999999997
real respect

2235.2 --> 2240.24
without proper backing without a purpose

2238.079 --> 2242.96
for the person they were just being like

2240.24 --> 2244.9599999999996
so yeah psychically milked

2242.96 --> 2246.16
and that's going to basically cause them

2244.96 --> 2247.44
to to

2246.16 --> 2250.96
break

2247.44 --> 2252.8
like their spirit's going to break apart

2250.96 --> 2254.839
and then they'll die

2252.8 --> 2256.48
or like kill themselves

2254.839 --> 2258.96
right

2256.48 --> 2260.96
so yeah it wasn't all just nice and

2258.96 --> 2263.28
dreamy and stuff

2260.96 --> 2264.8
there probably a lot of dark [ __ ] also

2263.28 --> 2267.52
happened

2264.8 --> 2268.8
i don't even want to go there

2267.52 --> 2271.8
[Music]

2268.8 --> 2271.8
uh

2272.07 --> 2280.2290000000003
[Music]

2282.62 --> 2286.469
[Music]

2292.89 --> 2296.02
[Music]

2310.839 --> 2315.52
what i ain't afraid of no ghost well you

2313.76 --> 2319.119
shouldn't be

2315.52 --> 2319.119
why would you be afraid of a ghost

2321.2 --> 2327.3199999999997
right unless they're there

2323.68 --> 2327.3199999999997
because of you

2328.64 --> 2334.24
the only thing you could be afraid of

2331.119 --> 2336.1600000000003
versus ghost is that you're hiding from

2334.24 --> 2338.64
yourself something

2336.16 --> 2340.72
that is effectively triggering the ghost

2338.64 --> 2342.3199999999997
to manifest

2340.72 --> 2345.04
then you should be afraid because then

2342.32 --> 2345.04
it's personal

2346.48 --> 2352.48
but yeah that only really happens when

2348.56 --> 2352.48
you go down really bad path

2352.64 --> 2359.7999999999997
and i don't think any of you here

2355.28 --> 2359.8
are at least doing that right now

2370.21 --> 2373.949
[Music]

2376.56 --> 2379.68
eat this scroll

2379.92 --> 2382.92
okay

2392.24 --> 2396.04
a past spirit

2401.68 --> 2407.9199999999996
do you know now but no no it can be

2405.599 --> 2410.079
karmic like in this situation i just

2407.92 --> 2412.4
described when you've done something

2410.079 --> 2414.88
like terrible and you're hiding it from

2412.4 --> 2414.88
yourself

2415.76 --> 2423.2000000000003
i do think that that actually can bind

2420.16 --> 2426.72
spirits that aren't just like

2423.2 --> 2426.72
non-human in origin

2429.68 --> 2434.3999999999996
and you'll be cursed with that

2432.24 --> 2435.5989999999997
like you bind themselves to them

2434.4 --> 2439.839
karmically

2435.599 --> 2439.839
by hiding something from yourself

2443.119 --> 2446.2400000000002
i don't recommend it

2450.96 --> 2457.28
right but it's not like if you're just

2453.76 --> 2459.119
like going about and doing your best

2457.28 --> 2461.119
being a good person and learning from

2459.119 --> 2464.6400000000003
your mistakes

2461.119 --> 2468.079
you're not gonna be enact by like

2464.64 --> 2470.72
the dead spirits or something right

2468.079 --> 2472.96
it never really happens does it

2470.72 --> 2475.52
it only really happens to people that

2472.96 --> 2475.52
are troubled

2475.599 --> 2480.319
and not because they see it it's b they

2478.24 --> 2483.04
see it because they're troubled not the

2480.319 --> 2483.04
other way around

2487.15 --> 2490.2090000000003
[Music]

2492.079 --> 2495.8390000000004
the curse from that comes late no

2496.96 --> 2502.56
oh judgment what

2499.2 --> 2502.56
what are you talking about no

2503.359 --> 2507.7599999999998
it only comes on judgment day if you

2506.0 --> 2510.24
choose to never

2507.76 --> 2510.2400000000002
atone

2519.52 --> 2523.8
have you watched blueberry godzilla

2528.8 --> 2532.1600000000003
i mean

2530.0 --> 2534.16
kind of the main story there for

2532.16 --> 2535.68
whatever that's worth it's more about

2534.16 --> 2538.0
the beauty

2535.68 --> 2541.8799999999997
is pretty much exactly about what i'm

2538.0 --> 2541.88
talking about right now

2556.16 --> 2560.64
we're responsible for the ghost

2558.72 --> 2563.2
yeah

2560.64 --> 2566.96
in your opinion okay well practical

2563.2 --> 2570.16
experiences of people disagree with that

2566.96 --> 2570.16
this is how it happens

2570.48 --> 2575.359
right and by the way yeah that even

2572.4 --> 2577.44
saying a ghost is is complicated a ghost

2575.359 --> 2581.5989999999997
is like a

2577.44 --> 2584.7200000000003
more like a physical manifestation thing

2581.599 --> 2584.7200000000003
like a poltergeist

2585.44 --> 2590.839
although that's even different in nature

2587.599 --> 2593.599
fueled by a person a living person

2590.839 --> 2595.119
right what i'm talking more about is

2593.599 --> 2597.119
spirits right

2595.119 --> 2598.0
ghost is like more

2597.119 --> 2602.2400000000002
yeah

2598.0 --> 2605.76
supernatural phenomenon related

2602.24 --> 2608.24
right more physical anchored approach

2605.76 --> 2609.2000000000003
talking about spirits like the actual

2608.24 --> 2611.839
people

2609.2 --> 2613.9199999999996
and like after they're dead

2611.839 --> 2617.2799999999997
no yeah because they don't all just like

2613.92 --> 2619.119
turn into ghosts like that

2617.28 --> 2622.8
i don't even think that a ghost the

2619.119 --> 2624.96
actual apparition manifestation thing

2622.8 --> 2627.04
is even like a full person i think it's

2624.96 --> 2630.2400000000002
an echo

2627.04 --> 2633.44
such manifestations are like

2630.24 --> 2635.52
echoes of like the person they're not

2633.44 --> 2638.0
actually their spirit their spirit might

2635.52 --> 2639.92
still be like

2638.0 --> 2642.079
in there

2639.92 --> 2644.96
but it's mostly an echo and it's all

2642.079 --> 2644.96
about letting go

2645.04 --> 2649.359
anyway

2647.119 --> 2651.92
yeah but that's ghosts

2649.359 --> 2654.56
poltergeists is is really like

2651.92 --> 2657.56
uncontrollable telekinesis it's

2654.56 --> 2657.56
different

2668.72 --> 2671.72
uh

2675.01 --> 2679.2000000000003
[Music]

2677.599 --> 2681.28
yeah yeah well

2679.2 --> 2685.2
yeah i think psych bear that these

2681.28 --> 2685.2000000000003
aliens are effectively

2685.52 --> 2691.0
well they're aliens they're alien

2687.52 --> 2691.0
spirits they're

2695.359 --> 2701.2
you could call them demonic because that

2697.28 --> 2701.2000000000003
is like the frequencies of what they do

2701.28 --> 2705.44
but they're not like

2702.8 --> 2707.76
just savage creatures that slaughter

2705.44 --> 2709.599
everything

2707.76 --> 2711.2000000000003
they're like

2709.599 --> 2713.599
spirits that have

2711.2 --> 2717.359
that are like severely aberrant that

2713.599 --> 2717.3590000000004
have basically alienated

2717.44 --> 2720.8
yeah it's in the word

2724.16 --> 2729.7599999999998
and potentially are trapped in that form

2726.96 --> 2733.359
in the other dimension and can't move on

2729.76 --> 2735.3590000000004
so they just have this crazy thing that

2733.359 --> 2738.0
these things that they do

2735.359 --> 2739.68
in response to people that also enter

2738.0 --> 2741.599
and that's it

2739.68 --> 2743.2
like these aliens could literally be

2741.599 --> 2744.839
cursed

2743.2 --> 2747.2799999999997
maybe former

2744.839 --> 2750.0789999999997
humans that have literally just done

2747.28 --> 2753.52
that to themselves

2750.079 --> 2755.52
maybe they were like satanist priests

2753.52 --> 2757.92
at some point or something

2755.52 --> 2757.92
could be

2758.24 --> 2764.4799999999996
and they're now like these weird

2760.48 --> 2764.48
dream creatures on the other side

2764.8 --> 2767.599
it could be that

2768.56 --> 2771.88
i don't know

2776.9 --> 2780.9990000000003
[Music]

2782.4 --> 2786.92
whatever they are they're not natural

2791.119 --> 2795.359
and

2792.88 --> 2799.28
i don't know for what it's worth i don't

2795.359 --> 2803.16
yet i think they're human in origin

2799.28 --> 2803.1600000000003
it smells like that

2804.48 --> 2809.359
like they don't

2806.8 --> 2811.44
smell like nature

2809.359 --> 2813.359
smell like human

2811.44 --> 2817.839
so i think whatever they are now they

2813.359 --> 2817.839
were probably originally human

2819.2 --> 2822.56
and they did it to themselves

2824.88 --> 2831.599
so yeah would that make them fallen

2827.119 --> 2834.96
angels in biblical terminology

2831.599 --> 2838.079
well maybe not the fallen angels from

2834.96 --> 2841.2
that time which is kind of time-bound

2838.079 --> 2841.2000000000003
but maybe they are

2843.119 --> 2846.7200000000003
like a shadow of that

2844.96 --> 2849.28
people that have basically yeah it's

2846.72 --> 2850.72
like satan is they want to do that right

2849.28 --> 2853.8390000000004
now it's not going to have like the

2850.72 --> 2856.3999999999996
power of the original break with god of

2853.839 --> 2858.96
his own things

2856.4 --> 2861.119
but an emulation of that so maybe there

2858.96 --> 2862.88
are like little fallen angels because

2861.119 --> 2864.96
they did it to themselves they wanted

2862.88 --> 2867.44
that and they're now just stuck to that

2864.96 --> 2869.52
place all void and hollow without

2867.44 --> 2871.52
purpose

2869.52 --> 2873.52
right

2871.52 --> 2875.7599999999998
because that is what aliens are like

2873.52 --> 2877.359
they're void and without purpose

2875.76 --> 2879.599
they're just indeed obsessed with

2877.359 --> 2881.2799999999997
control

2879.599 --> 2883.839
and meddling around

2881.28 --> 2885.2000000000003
and understanding things but without

2883.839 --> 2887.04
purpose

2885.2 --> 2888.5589999999997
there's no spirit guiding them they're

2887.04 --> 2891.04
all void

2888.559 --> 2891.0400000000004
hollow

2892.16 --> 2896.16
and thereby also very

2896.24 --> 2899.24
unempathetic

2900.64 --> 2905.2
like

2902.079 --> 2907.04
they don't have those sensories

2905.2 --> 2908.16
they don't treasure that they gave that

2907.04 --> 2911.2799999999997
all up

2908.16 --> 2914.7599999999998
in favor of like perfectionism for well

2911.28 --> 2914.76
i think control

2914.96 --> 2917.96
indeed

2918.82 --> 2921.9190000000003
[Music]

2928.559 --> 2935.76
by the way i do have rumors for you that

2932.88 --> 2937.76
they don't stay forever

2935.76 --> 2939.76
these things perish

2937.76 --> 2942.079
they can't be destroyed and then they

2939.76 --> 2944.559
like i don't know they go to the abyss

2942.079 --> 2944.559
or something

2954.079 --> 2960.4
they're very reminiscent of like ring

2956.559 --> 2962.6400000000003
rates like that the feel of it

2960.4 --> 2964.88
right very

2962.64 --> 2967.5989999999997
like scary they have like control over

2964.88 --> 2969.599
the other dimension but

2967.599 --> 2971.119
they are very much destroyable and

2969.599 --> 2974.0
they're like

2971.119 --> 2975.92
they're bound to something

2974.0 --> 2978.559
to probably what happened to them

2975.92 --> 2978.559
originally

2978.88 --> 2983.599
so i think that in that sense they

2980.8 --> 2986.2400000000002
probably have to do their things

2983.599 --> 2987.599
because it's tied into like an original

2986.24 --> 2989.5989999999997
agenda

2987.599 --> 2992.0
like the reasons why they

2989.599 --> 2995.559
chose to do that in the first place

2992.0 --> 2995.559
and become that

3002.4 --> 3009.359
perhaps they are in another holographic

3005.359 --> 3011.7599999999998
dimension and trying to escape perhaps

3009.359 --> 3012.48
no they are there they're in the dark

3011.76 --> 3013.599
world

3012.48 --> 3016.48
they're in

3013.599 --> 3019.28
the spirit realm not material yes they

3016.48 --> 3022.0
are there not a holographic dimension

3019.28 --> 3024.0
it's not another physical place

3022.0 --> 3027.0
it's a place between

3024.0 --> 3027.0
places

3029.68 --> 3032.7999999999997
and are they trying to escape from it

3031.52 --> 3034.88
well

3032.8 --> 3036.079
they can't and they know they can't but

3034.88 --> 3039.04
they can

3036.079 --> 3041.76
tap into people and potentially like

3039.04 --> 3046.119
even possess them interface with them

3041.76 --> 3046.119
and thereby still experience

3046.16 --> 3050.8799999999997
the third dimension physical world

3049.119 --> 3055.839
but they know

3050.88 --> 3055.839
that they can never actually go back

3058.8 --> 3062.319
you understand this can only be

3060.88 --> 3064.1600000000003
speculation

3062.319 --> 3066.839
now i'm tapping into something very

3064.16 --> 3069.359
serious right now like i

3066.839 --> 3071.2
divine like i know what i'm talking

3069.359 --> 3073.27
about even though it's like out of

3071.2 --> 3078.3999999999996
nowhere

3073.27 --> 3080.72
[Music]

3078.4 --> 3083.839
right when people say oh aliens or

3080.72 --> 3086.24
demons then i'm like yes

3083.839 --> 3090.0789999999997
but it's actually a little bit more

3086.24 --> 3093.7599999999998
specific and i just gave you an entire

3090.079 --> 3093.76
basically an entire story

3094.319 --> 3098.64
of what i truly think they are and how

3097.359 --> 3103.0789999999997
and why

3098.64 --> 3103.0789999999997
and like we can deal with them

3113.52 --> 3118.16
i think they must try survival

3118.559 --> 3121.44
well connectivity

3120.48 --> 3123.52
right

3121.44 --> 3125.52
otherwise that's just the abyss

3123.52 --> 3128.0
so yeah they have to keep the scam going

3125.52 --> 3130.16
because otherwise it's the abyss

3128.0 --> 3132.72
if there's nobody to remember that they

3130.16 --> 3134.8799999999997
exist and do anything with them

3132.72 --> 3136.5589999999997
then

3134.88 --> 3138.88
they just leave

3136.559 --> 3140.96
forever

3138.88 --> 3143.76
like the spirits that were actually tied

3140.96 --> 3145.68
in with that and the idea of aliens

3143.76 --> 3148.3190000000004
might return in the future but it's not

3145.68 --> 3148.319
gonna be them

3149.92 --> 3153.52
like once

3151.28 --> 3156.6400000000003
the dream that was conjured in order to

3153.52 --> 3158.0
do all that breaks they're literally

3156.64 --> 3160.24
gone

3158.0 --> 3163.88
those original spirits tied in with that

3160.24 --> 3163.8799999999997
through their own doing

3171.48 --> 3174.559
[Music]

3176.4 --> 3179.4
okay

3183.359 --> 3188.48
now well look godzilla look if you're

3185.599 --> 3191.3590000000004
trying to tell me

3188.48 --> 3194.8
like oh you're just speculating arwen

3191.359 --> 3197.68
then i'm saying no i'm not i'm not just

3194.8 --> 3197.6800000000003
speculating

3200.24 --> 3205.3999999999996
i know it works like this i know it

3213.76 --> 3218.96
that doesn't prove ghosts dude i've seen

3216.319 --> 3222.16
ghosts actual like

3218.96 --> 3224.2400000000002
i saw my mother's ghost before i even

3222.16 --> 3226.319
knew she had died

3224.24 --> 3228.64
and the whole elaborate experience could

3226.319 --> 3232.64
never forget that ever

3228.64 --> 3235.44
it was like a full-blown apparition like

3232.64 --> 3237.1189999999997
act like it was dark at night

3235.44 --> 3240.48
no lights around

3237.119 --> 3242.0
and like literally a white veil like

3240.48 --> 3244.16
silhouette

3242.0 --> 3245.44
it's just like movie like

3244.16 --> 3246.64
literal

3245.44 --> 3249.44
ghost

3246.64 --> 3251.7599999999998
i know it exists i did not have free

3249.44 --> 3254.88
knowledge of her death

3251.76 --> 3259.48
figured out right after

3254.88 --> 3259.48
okay i know it exists

3264.559 --> 3268.2400000000002
all right and that's just that was my

3266.24 --> 3270.8799999999997
mother's the most full-blown apparition

3268.24 --> 3272.24
i've ever witnessed but i've i see other

3270.88 --> 3273.599
ghosts too

3272.24 --> 3275.839
it's just

3273.599 --> 3277.2000000000003
i'm not scared of it

3275.839 --> 3279.68
so then

3277.2 --> 3282.24
it just is like it's just the feeling of

3279.68 --> 3284.24
a presence to me

3282.24 --> 3285.2
like just like you feel the presence of

3284.24 --> 3287.04
people

3285.2 --> 3290.0
except it's another type of frequency

3287.04 --> 3292.88
it's just like oh there's something

3290.0 --> 3296.24
here i'm not scared of it

3292.88 --> 3298.1600000000003
i'm not scared of ghosts

3296.24 --> 3300.319
or spirits or

3298.16 --> 3303.87
dark spirits even

3300.319 --> 3308.3
because i know how they work

3303.87 --> 3308.2999999999997
[Music]

3308.48 --> 3314.72
you know it's not a demon agent

3311.76 --> 3317.7200000000003
well gins are

3314.72 --> 3317.72
rare

3324.48 --> 3329.44
i mean

3325.76 --> 3330.96
jin is not taken to be taken lightly

3329.44 --> 3332.839
godzilla

3330.96 --> 3337.599
like that's an actual

3332.839 --> 3337.599
powerful like extra dimensional thing

3337.839 --> 3341.7599999999998
and they have

3339.28 --> 3343.44
like their own spirit they're not

3341.76 --> 3346.079
completely void

3343.44 --> 3349.48
it's just that they're not you they were

3346.079 --> 3349.48
never human

3349.839 --> 3353.44
a gin is a very different thing

3354.48 --> 3361.119
demons play game yeah i know

3358.079 --> 3361.119
but ghosts are not

3361.68 --> 3367.2799999999997
right ghost is

3364.079 --> 3367.28
it's not an entity

3367.76 --> 3370.48
it's a

3368.799 --> 3373.68
side effect

3370.48 --> 3376.4
that you can pick up on

3373.68 --> 3379.5989999999997
if you have the senses for it like and a

3376.4 --> 3382.2400000000002
spirit of a person like after death is

3379.599 --> 3384.6400000000003
different you don't typically see that

3382.24 --> 3386.72
although you could there's moments where

3384.64 --> 3389.68
suddenly somebody is like whoa

3386.72 --> 3393.04
see my grandma's right here i heard so

3389.68 --> 3394.16
many of these types of experiences

3393.04 --> 3398.5589999999997
so

3394.16 --> 3398.5589999999997
but that's very different from a gin

3399.04 --> 3403.2799999999997
and demons is kind of a vague

3400.799 --> 3406.0
description at that gin is much more

3403.28 --> 3407.0400000000004
specific demons is more like like

3406.0 --> 3410.319
everything

3407.04 --> 3410.319
everything that's sort of dark

3411.04 --> 3414.04
so

3423.599 --> 3427.2000000000003
right

3424.72 --> 3430.52
that's right demons

3427.2 --> 3430.52
that's what

3437.04 --> 3440.48
right

3438.16 --> 3442.96
well that's pjc now that's another way

3440.48 --> 3446.72
of using the word again that's like your

3442.96 --> 3448.48
demons plaguing you it's your challenges

3446.72 --> 3450.24
your suffering that you have to figure

3448.48 --> 3453.28
your way through

3450.24 --> 3454.16
right it's very personal

3453.28 --> 3456.1600000000003
right

3454.16 --> 3459.359
it's a different thing it's not an

3456.16 --> 3462.64
entity it's a part of you it's a part of

3459.359 --> 3462.64
your consciousness

3463.04 --> 3467.2799999999997
it's the struggle

3464.48 --> 3471.64
it's not an entity really not not those

3467.28 --> 3471.6400000000003
types not that word use

3474.079 --> 3480.96
exactly uh whatever gourds

3478.24 --> 3483.5989999999997
and don't don't give me that attitude

3480.96 --> 3485.68
sorry but true godzilla if you're gonna

3483.599 --> 3488.1600000000003
go full savage on me

3485.68 --> 3490.319
i'm gonna get really pissed off don't

3488.16 --> 3494.0789999999997
talk to me like that in my chat

3490.319 --> 3494.079

3495.97 --> 3499.0699999999997
[Music]

3500.799 --> 3504.48
talking about classification of

3504.48 --> 3509.68
supernatural things

3506.559 --> 3509.6800000000003
i was doing that

3509.92 --> 3513.839
this is still a website about it i was

3511.839 --> 3515.2
doing that

3513.839 --> 3517.52
is it now

3515.2 --> 3519.04
16 years ago

3517.52 --> 3522.96
all right

3519.04 --> 3522.96
by the whole classification list

3524.48 --> 3527.92
yeah oh i can't know

3526.559 --> 3531.28
well

3527.92 --> 3533.359
who are you to say that

3531.28 --> 3535.599
who the hell are you to say that i can't

3533.359 --> 3535.5989999999997
know

3535.68 --> 3541.359
what you think you can invoke that on me

3538.72 --> 3545.4399999999996
and i'm gonna accept that in some kind

3541.359 --> 3547.359
of attempt to try to be to show humility

3545.44 --> 3550.16
about something that i'm quite certain

3547.359 --> 3550.16
about no

3550.24 --> 3553.839
i know

3551.92 --> 3557.28
what i'm talking about

3553.839 --> 3559.119
and when i don't know i immediately

3557.28 --> 3561.119
recognize that

3559.119 --> 3563.359
and then fix it i know what i'm talking

3561.119 --> 3563.359
about

3563.68 --> 3568.0789999999997
and you're not gonna tell me i can't

3565.839 --> 3568.0789999999997

it's very simple

3632.88 --> 3636.0
yeah

3634.48 --> 3638.96

blank statement you don't know

who the [ __ ] are you to tell anybody

3641.44 --> 3644.559
they don't know

3642.88 --> 3648.079
test their knowledge

3644.559 --> 3649.52
sure do it right ask questions lay down

3648.079 --> 3652.079
an alternative

3649.52 --> 3654.319
and see what happens

if you're just gonna say you can't know

3654.319 --> 3657.839
that's you projecting

3658.559 --> 3663.92
your inability to know in that moment

3662.0 --> 3666.88
onto me

3753.839 --> 3758.0
this just feels like he just went on a

3756.079 --> 3760.319
gamma roll all of a sudden maybe it's

3758.0 --> 3762.24
his wife maybe like

3760.319 --> 3764.0
his wife

3762.24 --> 3767.2
made him do something that he really

3764.0 --> 3768.64
didn't want to do in order to support me

3767.2 --> 3771.2799999999997
well

3768.64 --> 3772.64
if this is the result i'd rather have

3771.28 --> 3775.3590000000004
gorzilla

3772.64 --> 3775.359
being cool

3775.76 --> 3779.8390000000004
and not giving me a paypal than giving

3778.0 --> 3781.359
me a paypal and then kind of turning

3779.839 --> 3785.68
into a gamma

3781.359 --> 3788.96
because he did something that was not

3785.68 --> 3788.96
he's not really happy about

3790.319 --> 3795.119
now i'm guessing

3792.319 --> 3797.92
right i don't know

3795.119 --> 3801.2000000000003
see i know when i know something and i

3797.92 --> 3801.2000000000003

obviously you weren't listening like in

3850.48 --> 3857.92
the last 10 minutes or you know exactly

3854.0 --> 3857.92
why i deleted those messages

3862.48 --> 3867.02

me i can't know

3876.48 --> 3882.4
or describing

3878.799 --> 3884.96
like ghosts and poltergeists and

3882.4 --> 3888.64
all jinns came up

3884.96 --> 3891.28
demons like what is that colloquially

3888.64 --> 3894.24
and aliens and like what are they and i

3891.28 --> 3895.28
made a whole elaborate description

3894.24 --> 3897.0389999999998
that's

3895.28 --> 3899.44
for a whole bunch of people seemingly

3897.039 --> 3901.76
pro comes out of nowhere

3899.44 --> 3905.2000000000003

3901.76 --> 3907.2000000000003
for a very long time

3905.2 --> 3909.1189999999997
made it my study

3907.2 --> 3910.72
like a decade ago

3909.119 --> 3912.88
i really did

3910.72 --> 3914.8799999999997
and i do know what i'm talking about

3912.88 --> 3917.839
when i talk about these things and you

3914.88 --> 3919.599
can tell me i can't know

3917.839 --> 3925.68
say that about yourself

3919.599 --> 3925.6800000000003
don't talk to me about what i can't know

3932.48 --> 3937.839
yeah you were giving me lip godzilla you

3935.359 --> 3937.839
were

3949.92 --> 3955.039
yeah well you can't tell anybody that

3952.72 --> 3957.359
they can't know i'm sorry

3955.039 --> 3959.3590000000004
it seems like this little

3957.359 --> 3961.119
philosophical aberration that you're

3959.359 --> 3963.359
holding on to that nobody can know

3961.119 --> 3966.1600000000003
anything yeah i disagree

3963.359 --> 3969.48

3990.799 --> 3997.44
it's not backed by anything

3995.039 --> 3997.44
all right

4000.319 --> 4004.96
you didn't back your argumentation

4002.319 --> 4006.4
you're just stating it

4004.96 --> 4008.4
and repeating it over and over again

4006.4 --> 4009.92
without backing it by an actual argument

4008.4 --> 4012.2400000000002
that's what you did godzilla and that's

4009.92 --> 4015.2400000000002

know i don't know how they do that

i do all the time by explaining what i

know

in the realm

4208.64 --> 4212.64
and in the spirit realm

4210.8 --> 4214.8
but if this is the way you're going to

4212.64 --> 4217.92
then make a stand over that

4214.8 --> 4221.76
and just defile

4217.92 --> 4224.159

4289.76 --> 4295.52

you're going to be very

4497.92 --> 4503.12
very kicked in the dick because of this

you have no sense of respect

4520.88 --> 4525.12
you talk to people to their face like

4523.12 --> 4527.12
that

4525.12 --> 4530.48
when they tell you something about

4527.12 --> 4530.48
a story like that dude

4538.96 --> 4543.28
fight no my mother

my mother

4543.28 --> 4545.599999999999
okay

4551.04 --> 4555.199
like his behavior

4552.48 --> 4557.199
now makes me

4555.199 --> 4559.919999999999
kind of hesitant

4557.199 --> 4563.678999999999
like should i even be sharing such

4559.92 --> 4565.92
things on a platform like this

4563.679 --> 4568.719

4568.719 --> 4571.28
no

4569.76 --> 4573.52
no

4571.28 --> 4575.599999999999
i'm just gonna step all over that

4578.0 --> 4584.08

4623.28 --> 4627.92
apologizes and proves to me understands

4625.92 --> 4630.719

4627.92 --> 4630.719

4652.08 --> 4658.5599999999995
i wouldn't even recognize

4655.679 --> 4658.56
my own mother

like a dark spirit

4664.8 --> 4667.92
if

4665.84 --> 4669.12
there is literally no darkness about

4669.12 --> 4674.96
in the interaction then it how how are

4671.92 --> 4678.2390000000005
you just gonna say no no no you it could

4674.96 --> 4680.88
be the devil the devil's around every

4678.239 --> 4682.4

4680.88 --> 4683.36

4682.4 --> 4685.12
devil

4683.36 --> 4688.639999999999
that was doing that

4685.12 --> 4691.199
yeah oh well guess what freaking devils

4688.64 --> 4693.280000000001
have kind of things they do by which you

4691.199 --> 4695.44
can recognize one

4693.28 --> 4698.8
especially if they're undercover you

4695.44 --> 4701.599999999999
start to recognize what they do yeah so

4698.8 --> 4704.400000000001
i do [ __ ] know

4701.6 --> 4707.92
how to recognize a dark spirit when i

4704.4 --> 4709.36
face one and i have methods for testing

that

4709.36 --> 4713.759999999999
yeah i [ __ ] know what i'm talking

4712.8 --> 4718.08
about

4713.76 --> 4719.84
i'm not some goofy-ass 15-year-old nerd

are you even doing here

4741.47 --> 4744.709
[Music]

4748.0 --> 4753.199
what are my methods of testing that

4750.239 --> 4754.48
paying attention looking for the signs

4753.199 --> 4759.44
testing

4754.48 --> 4762.48
the frequency everything every sensory

4759.44 --> 4766.799999999999
is part of the method everything the

4762.48 --> 4770.0
most primary objective of my methods are

4766.8 --> 4772.96
don't discard anything

4770.0 --> 4776.48
do not ignore anything always pay

4772.96 --> 4778.56
attention to every little detail

4776.48 --> 4781.839999999999
when something really

4778.56 --> 4783.92
intense happens and it doesn't matter if

4781.84 --> 4785.76
you don't understand what is happening

4783.92 --> 4788.96
in the moment it's only important that

4785.76 --> 4791.84
you keep recognizing the frequencies as

4788.96 --> 4794.08
it happens in order to establish

4791.84 --> 4797.76
eventually throughout the experience

4794.08 --> 4800.32
what it is that you're actually facing

4797.76 --> 4803.76
it's fully mechanized for me

4800.32 --> 4805.599999999999
learned this [ __ ] when i was like five

4803.76 --> 4807.679
because i've been facing a lot of weird

4805.6 --> 4810.92
[ __ ] in my dreams

4807.679 --> 4810.92
a lot

4814.44 --> 4817.5
[Music]

4826.88 --> 4830.08
right

4828.239 --> 4832.5599999999995
and yeah do you think i haven't like

4830.08 --> 4833.92
thought back to that moment

4832.56 --> 4836.92
which was in

4833.92 --> 4836.92
2005

4839.52 --> 4843.76
i mean

4841.04 --> 4847.199
that's going to be with me forever that

4843.76 --> 4849.280000000001
that happened and how it happened

4847.199 --> 4853.04
and what i reckon like there's literal

4849.28 --> 4853.04
the memories still right there

4853.6 --> 4859.360000000001
i still even know like i could literally

4856.56 --> 4861.679
name percentages of how much i was

4859.36 --> 4863.28
paying attention to the physical realm

4861.679 --> 4866.96
and how much

4863.28 --> 4871.12
percentage was stuck to like virtual at

4866.96 --> 4874.159
every detail every detail

4871.12 --> 4876.96
the my notes everything is right there

4874.159 --> 4876.96
in my memory

4878.08 --> 4884.679
sorry for my loss yeah thanks

4880.88 --> 4884.679
ages ago now

4888.0 --> 4892.159
not no not in my dreams god

4896.8 --> 4899.84
just dude

4899.92 --> 4904.4800000000005
we don't care that you just came in and

4902.639 --> 4906.159000000001
missed everything and now want to be

4904.48 --> 4910.718999999999
informed why don't you just fricking

4906.159 --> 4913.44
watch my show and find out

4910.719 --> 4916.76
i'm not here to inform you because of

4913.44 --> 4916.759999999999
your negligence

4950.239 --> 4955.759999999999
they're patrolled fuller of course

4952.639 --> 4959.04
i mean when a flat earther gets slapped

4955.76 --> 4961.04
then all the the gamma baller squirt

4959.04 --> 4962.88
boys are all like oh my god does that

4961.04 --> 4965.679
mean we're winning now

4962.88 --> 4968.08
does it mean we're finally winning

4965.679 --> 4971.28
they're basically like

4968.08 --> 4973.6
pit slaves that are just like oh my god

4971.28 --> 4977.759999999999
can we get out now

4973.6 --> 4979.280000000001
can we please get out of this pit

4977.76 --> 4982.76
yeah

4979.28 --> 4982.759999999999
it's what they do

5033.76 --> 5037.76
miss them well to be fair

5039.04 --> 5042.04
no

5042.639 --> 5047.84
my mother was like

5044.4 --> 5049.92
the time that the last like few years

5047.84 --> 5053.12
that she was still around she was like

5049.92 --> 5055.6
going insane and at times it was like

5053.12 --> 5057.28
she was even possessed

5055.6 --> 5058.639
like by a demon

5057.28 --> 5060.88
because she and she was on

5058.639 --> 5062.88
pharmaceuticals really terrible for her

5060.88 --> 5064.56
and all that and and out panicking

5062.88 --> 5067.6
always freaking panicking like

5064.56 --> 5069.120000000001
fundamental panicking like completely

5067.6 --> 5073.92
out of control

5069.12 --> 5073.92
of their life type of panic terrible

5076.96 --> 5081.12
and

5078.639 --> 5083.04
yeah sometimes i do wonder like what

5081.12 --> 5085.199
would she have been doing if she was

5083.04 --> 5086.0
still around and she survived all that

5085.199 --> 5088.799999999999
and

5086.0 --> 5090.88
like would she be making music or would

5088.8 --> 5093.76
she just

5090.88 --> 5095.679
be terrible on the terrible path which

5093.76 --> 5097.1990000000005
she was gradually

5095.679 --> 5098.8
walking

5097.199 --> 5100.5599999999995
like

5098.8 --> 5101.52
for a decade

5100.56 --> 5103.76
like

5101.52 --> 5106.0
she was not going in the right direction

5103.76 --> 5108.320000000001
she was like getting liberal in a bad

5106.0 --> 5108.32
way

5109.679 --> 5114.2390000000005
so in that sense yeah

5114.48 --> 5118.638999999999
i wouldn't be like oh my god everything

5116.88 --> 5120.88
is to a change for the better if she

5118.639 --> 5123.52
would still be around right

5120.88 --> 5125.84
because she might have just gone really

5123.52 --> 5130.320000000001
terrible

5125.84 --> 5130.32
then i would have like freaking mothers

5130.56 --> 5134.400000000001
then i would be a freaking grappler

5132.32 --> 5137.12
being like okay mommy

5134.4 --> 5140.159
can you do this now mommy it's not just

5137.12 --> 5141.84
kidding it wouldn't be like that but

5140.159 --> 5142.879999999999
it's just

5141.84 --> 5145.4400000000005
we had a

5142.88 --> 5145.4400000000005
history

5146.0 --> 5148.96
and yeah

5152.639 --> 5160.0
it has nothing to do with birds howard

5156.56 --> 5163.0
[ __ ] stop being freaking pointlessly

5160.0 --> 5163.0
random

5174.8 --> 5179.76
maybe you're just hearing voices in your

5176.8 --> 5182.159000000001
head like what birds birds are not

5179.76 --> 5184.4800000000005
involved were not mentioned in any of

5182.159 --> 5186.799999999999
anything

5184.48 --> 5188.4
in that discussion not a single time

5186.8 --> 5191.400000000001
like what the hell are you blabbering

5188.4 --> 5191.4
about

5207.76 --> 5215.12
nobody john 925 it's howard literally

5211.36 --> 5215.12
just being a nutter

5220.719 --> 5224.76
all right i'm gonna get my teeth

5324.719 --> 5331.4800000000005
god damn it i forgot my teeth

5327.44 --> 5331.48
i just went to the toilet

5380.08 --> 5383.639
and i'm back

5389.22 --> 5392.279
[Music]

5396.88 --> 5399.88
uh

5415.12 --> 5418.36
all right

5426.48 --> 5431.44
so any feedback

5429.52 --> 5434.4400000000005
i'm not going to run out my show just

5431.44 --> 5434.44
yet

5434.8 --> 5438.639
i mean if you guys want to discuss

5436.32 --> 5442.88
whether it was good or not

5438.639 --> 5443.84
that i banned gorzilla even though

5442.88 --> 5447.0
yeah

5443.84 --> 5447.0
i mean

5448.639 --> 5455.6
i think i made it pretty clear why i'm

5451.76 --> 5455.6
like why that's really insulting

5457.84 --> 5462.0
it's like

5459.199 --> 5464.879999999999
it's basically like saying oh you don't

5462.0 --> 5465.76
recognize your own mother

5464.88 --> 5466.8
yeah

5465.76 --> 5469.12
i mean

5466.8 --> 5469.12
that's

5470.639 --> 5474.400000000001
because yeah oh theoretically it could

5473.36 --> 5475.92
have been there yeah but that's

5474.4 --> 5478.4
basically what it comes down to is

5475.92 --> 5480.4800000000005
saying like no no you might be mistaken

5478.4 --> 5483.04
or when you might have

5480.48 --> 5484.32
not recognized that it wasn't your

5483.04 --> 5487.44
mother

5484.32 --> 5489.5199999999995
like what the [ __ ]

5487.44 --> 5493.04
so you are effectively saying i don't

5489.52 --> 5493.040000000001
even recognize my own mother

5493.28 --> 5497.04
that is just

5494.48 --> 5497.04
bizarre

5503.52 --> 5506.2390000000005
what

5504.4 --> 5509.839999999999
okay howard

5506.239 --> 5511.44
well that's you just tripping then fine

5509.84 --> 5514.32
birds

5511.44 --> 5514.32
i like birds

5515.04 --> 5519.8
she was a talented composer yeah

5521.36 --> 5527.12
and i wish that she hadn't

5524.639 --> 5530.56
started to become liberal

5527.12 --> 5535.36
i really wish she hadn't

5530.56 --> 5537.280000000001
but she did she got caught up in it

5535.36 --> 5540.639
the liberal [ __ ]

5537.28 --> 5542.159
and in a way so did i but i

5540.639 --> 5544.159000000001
not

5542.159 --> 5546.5599999999995
fully

5544.159 --> 5548.48
i think that in ways she did really

5546.56 --> 5552.56
surrender to that

5548.48 --> 5552.5599999999995
which is like a terrifying idea

5552.719 --> 5555.84
like

5553.6 --> 5555.84
yeah

5558.08 --> 5561.84
god will sort it all out

5576.96 --> 5580.0
a truly yeah

5586.48 --> 5592.959999999999
right so i can basically throw something

5589.36 --> 5596.08
out and it is like a shame of mine

5592.96 --> 5598.84
but yeah my mother was a great composer

5596.08 --> 5602.48
but she was getting caught up in the

5598.84 --> 5603.84
normalization of sexuality like even in

5602.48 --> 5606.0
songs

5603.84 --> 5608.400000000001
like the text

5606.0 --> 5610.32
and that was like i was really grossed

5608.4 --> 5612.32
out by it i just thought like ah that's

5610.32 --> 5614.84
my mother or whatever but i realized

5612.32 --> 5620.239
later like no that's just really

5614.84 --> 5620.2390000000005
bad it's liberal but it's not good

5621.04 --> 5624.96
like i don't have those songs

5625.12 --> 5629.36
in my playlist

5626.719 --> 5632.08
they are out there and i'm really really

5629.36 --> 5634.32
embarrassed about it really embarrassed

5632.08 --> 5636.639
and i hope to never hear them ever again

5634.32 --> 5636.639
really

5638.56 --> 5642.0
i haven't heard them in

5642.08 --> 5647.4
20 years

5643.76 --> 5647.400000000001
something like that

5648.22 --> 5651.279
[Music]

5658.85 --> 5662.049
[Music]

5669.16 --> 5671.36
[Music]

5670.239 --> 5673.36
all right

5671.36 --> 5676.159
so but yeah george sanford i'd like to

5673.36 --> 5679.12
think of myself as a true liberal

5676.159 --> 5682.48
it's what i resonated with most and then

5679.12 --> 5682.48
the grim illusion

5682.88 --> 5687.92
transformed it all and changed the good

5685.76 --> 5689.04
liberals and basically poisoned their

5687.92 --> 5691.119
well and

5689.04 --> 5692.4
started turning them into what they're

5691.119 --> 5695.28
now

5692.4 --> 5697.199
i was like right at the peak

5695.28 --> 5701.759999999999
of when it was still good

5697.199 --> 5705.36
and i was like yes i'm gonna be

5701.76 --> 5707.1990000000005
part of this and then it's poison

5705.36 --> 5709.44
it was already getting poisoned but

5707.199 --> 5711.5199999999995
suddenly it was getting really bad

5709.44 --> 5714.638999999999
like i could feel like there's

5711.52 --> 5715.76
there's some really [ __ ] up darkness

5714.639 --> 5718.0
in this

5715.76 --> 5720.8
and i got to meet people that were like

5718.0 --> 5722.639
really dark in their minds

5720.8 --> 5724.96
that were like

5722.639 --> 5726.56
literally hand rubbing over how

5724.96 --> 5729.92
everything was going to get corrupted

5726.56 --> 5729.92
and bragging about it

5730.719 --> 5734.679
didn't believe them at first

5747.28 --> 5755.119
okay yeah howard i agree

5750.719 --> 5755.119
it i talked about that many times

5755.84 --> 5759.4400000000005
it's it but yeah if people are not gonna

5757.84 --> 5762.400000000001
give it then they're not gonna give it

5759.44 --> 5765.199
and i yeah i am not

5762.4 --> 5768.239
i am not the radio show

5765.199 --> 5768.239
right i am not

5769.119 --> 5773.199
well most others

5771.04 --> 5774.48
most other youtube and related shows

5773.199 --> 5776.159
where it's just like yeah they're

5774.48 --> 5777.678999999999
entertainers they're always talking

5776.159 --> 5778.719
they're always doing something it's

5777.679 --> 5781.04
always interesting they always have a

5778.719 --> 5784.96
subject ready they always have their own

5781.04 --> 5786.56
thing that they do well i do that

5784.96 --> 5789.36
but i don't

5786.56 --> 5791.92
turn it into like a standard

5789.36 --> 5793.199
procedure to keep talking about

5791.92 --> 5797.8
something

5793.199 --> 5797.799999999999
right i addressed this yesterday

5799.36 --> 5803.679
so it's never going to be a radio it's

5801.28 --> 5805.5199999999995
much more going to be like yeah i'm the

5803.679 --> 5807.36
guy that's sitting in the room right

5805.52 --> 5810.4800000000005
next to you

5807.36 --> 5813.44
that's more what this is it's a workshop

5810.48 --> 5815.44
this is not like the radio you put on

5813.44 --> 5817.36
while you just do stuff

5815.44 --> 5819.28
for it to be in the background and you

5817.36 --> 5821.119
listen to it sometimes and laugh or

5819.28 --> 5822.4
whatever

5821.119 --> 5823.5199999999995
it's not

5822.4 --> 5824.879999999999
like that

5823.52 --> 5826.719
it's more

5824.88 --> 5829.76
direct

5826.719 --> 5829.76
that's how i do things

5833.7 --> 5837.84
[Music]

5836.08 --> 5839.199
and yeah

5837.84 --> 5842.2390000000005
it is still

5839.199 --> 5844.239
effectively funded by the yeah by people

5842.239 --> 5846.799999999999
that do come here and that do appreciate

5844.239 --> 5846.799999999999
what i do

5849.76 --> 5855.159000000001
but

5850.96 --> 5855.159
i don't know i'm not getting rich

5856.48 --> 5861.199
well except for when yeah

5858.88 --> 5863.119
tony whitcomb like drops over a hundred

5861.199 --> 5865.678999999999
dollars on me

5863.119 --> 5868.159
that does really help but still like

5865.679 --> 5870.56
that's not like an annual event or

5868.159 --> 5870.5599999999995
anything

5875.84 --> 5880.2390000000005
no that's not annual a daily event

5881.28 --> 5886.429999999999
it's more like a monthly event but

5883.28 --> 5886.429999999999
[Music]

5893.76 --> 5898.08
right

5895.52 --> 5901.040000000001
but yeah i never expected to get rich

5898.08 --> 5901.04
from doing this

5901.44 --> 5906.799999999999
i mean

5902.56 --> 5910.679
actual true pure truth

5906.8 --> 5910.679
is not profitable

5911.92 --> 5915.52
because

5914.159 --> 5916.4
lies

5915.52 --> 5919.040000000001
are

5916.4 --> 5919.04
profitable

5922.96 --> 5927.119
and then yeah

5924.639 --> 5929.119
like find your crowd find your what

5927.119 --> 5932.799999999999
people are like what they talk about and

5929.119 --> 5934.239
then tell them what they want to hear

5932.8 --> 5936.400000000001
what they want to hear is going to be

5934.239 --> 5940.718999999999
prioritized

5936.4 --> 5942.879999999999
over whether it is actually purely true

5940.719 --> 5945.28
because of reasons they might not be

5942.88 --> 5948.32
able to handle it they might not want to

5945.28 --> 5948.32
be confronted with it

5950.08 --> 5953.92
so you just give them what they want and

5952.32 --> 5956.48
that's profitable they don't feel

5953.92 --> 5958.4800000000005
disturbed in a very specific way

5956.48 --> 5960.48
and then they're like happy about it and

5958.48 --> 5963.5199999999995
then they want to treasure that place

5960.48 --> 5965.28
and give it money

5963.52 --> 5966.8
that's why a lot of people out there are

5965.28 --> 5970.48
doing it

5966.8 --> 5970.4800000000005
it doesn't really seem to work here

5971.6 --> 5975.4800000000005
it's much more random

5989.6 --> 5995.280000000001
how do i want it to go further

5993.28 --> 5998.5599999999995
i'm not sure

5995.28 --> 6001.36
i'm i'm really not entirely sure

5998.56 --> 6004.0
i mean i think that eventually i might

6001.36 --> 6006.08
have to figure out how to basically do a

6004.0 --> 6007.36
little more than just sit here in the

6006.08 --> 6010.4
room

6007.36 --> 6010.4
talking to the chat

6016.159 --> 6020.799999999999
but i don't want to make it like a

6018.08 --> 6023.92
multi-people show i do really want to

6020.8 --> 6027.04
just keep me here

6023.92 --> 6027.04
i really like the

6028.639 --> 6032.56
uh yeah

6030.0 --> 6033.36
basically the throne of being the only

6032.56 --> 6035.6
one

6033.36 --> 6036.4
that has auditory capability in this

6035.6 --> 6040.320000000001
scenario

6036.4 --> 6040.32
i really am liking that

6041.679 --> 6046.719
but yeah without

6044.08 --> 6050.639
other people then there's not going to

6046.719 --> 6051.92
be a lot that i talk about though

6050.639 --> 6054.719
so

6051.92 --> 6056.159
i kind of want to keep that aspect

6054.719 --> 6058.719
but

6056.159 --> 6060.799999999999
yeah sometimes i do think like but what

6058.719 --> 6062.84
if i could actually

6060.8 --> 6065.84
somehow get out there and

6062.84 --> 6068.639
like yeah the only thing though that i

6065.84 --> 6071.1990000000005
can envision on how to do that

6068.639 --> 6074.159000000001
is by getting a freaking smartphone and

6071.199 --> 6074.159
i've literally

6074.639 --> 6080.88
vowed to never ever do that so i am kind

6078.56 --> 6082.639
of desperate at this point like an other

6080.88 --> 6084.08
type of device

6082.639 --> 6085.6
that could do the same thing that could

6084.08 --> 6087.679
live stream that could have a live

6085.6 --> 6090.0
internet connection

6087.679 --> 6092.639
some limited computer ability so that i

6090.0 --> 6095.6
could do stream on it

6092.639 --> 6097.52
right and not be a [ __ ] smartphone

6095.6 --> 6100.08
it's basically i want

6097.52 --> 6102.320000000001
streaming like in the field wireless

6100.08 --> 6106.88
streaming capability

6102.32 --> 6108.96
but the the one defining demand is

6106.88 --> 6110.639
no matter what it's not a freaking

6108.96 --> 6112.4
smartphone

6110.639 --> 6116.76
that's what i want

6112.4 --> 6116.759999999999
i don't even know if that exists

6123.52 --> 6127.360000000001
sometimes it's slow start because

6125.6 --> 6129.52
there's not always something that comes

6127.36 --> 6131.92
to mind talk about yes

6129.52 --> 6134.96
well i i would kind of appreciate it

6131.92 --> 6135.92
though and i know you guys do do that if

6134.96 --> 6138.4
you

6135.92 --> 6140.639
kind of anticipated like oh our winston

6138.4 --> 6142.08
show is starting

6140.639 --> 6145.36
and like

6142.08 --> 6147.36
to remember things that you would like

6145.36 --> 6149.36
to bring up on my show

6147.36 --> 6151.44
i'm always hoping that you basically

6149.36 --> 6152.239
remember things from the day that's like

6151.44 --> 6153.199
oh

6152.239 --> 6155.678999999999
yeah

6153.199 --> 6156.719
let's bring this

6155.679 --> 6158.4
thing

6156.719 --> 6159.52
to arwen and see what he has to say

6158.4 --> 6161.36
about it

6159.52 --> 6163.1990000000005
because i'll bet y'all have something to

6161.36 --> 6164.88
say about it

6163.199 --> 6167.28
and hopefully that will even like

6164.88 --> 6168.08
broaden your own perspective and enrich

6167.28 --> 6169.84
you

6168.08 --> 6171.76
right so i'm always hoping that you guys

6169.84 --> 6174.32
are basically just gonna

6171.76 --> 6176.400000000001
bring forth information

6174.32 --> 6179.5199999999995
but yeah you not everybody here is

6176.4 --> 6179.5199999999995
always in the mood for that

6188.56 --> 6191.56
what

6196.96 --> 6200.56
89

6199.6 --> 6204.400000000001
what

6200.56 --> 6207.1990000000005
82 year old parrot man

6204.4 --> 6209.679
that's an old freaking bird

6207.199 --> 6209.678999999999
amazing

6212.88 --> 6216.96
ipod touch i

6215.04 --> 6219.6
no but that's pretty much the same thing

6216.96 --> 6222.6
howard like that's almost

6219.6 --> 6222.6
indistinguishable

6228.96 --> 6232.52
like it yeah

6233.04 --> 6237.119
i don't know man

6235.44 --> 6239.36
i don't know how i'm gonna fix it just

6237.119 --> 6239.36
yet

6243.679 --> 6249.36
maybe some ipod would work but here's

6246.239 --> 6251.36
the thing what if i then get the ipod

6249.36 --> 6253.5199999999995
it's like installing everything and then

6251.36 --> 6257.28
there turns out to be just this one

6253.52 --> 6259.92
thing that just won't work no matter

6257.28 --> 6262.159
what now i bought the damn thing it's

6259.92 --> 6263.679
actually not doing what i wanted to do

6262.159 --> 6267.839999999999
and i'm [ __ ]

6263.679 --> 6267.84
because either you spend more money

6268.08 --> 6271.28
you know or you give up

6270.239 --> 6272.4
like

6271.28 --> 6274.639
i am

6272.4 --> 6276.96
very pessimistic

6274.639 --> 6278.719
about modern electronics like that i

6276.96 --> 6282.56
really am

6278.719 --> 6285.44
always [ __ ] doesn't work out always it

6282.56 --> 6288.0
happens unless you make those [ __ ]

6285.44 --> 6289.759999999999
things your entire life and know

6288.0 --> 6292.48
everything about him and then you can

6289.76 --> 6295.280000000001
always kind of fix it yeah you only have

6292.48 --> 6296.5599999999995
to basically surrender your entire soul

6295.28 --> 6300.5199999999995
to it

6296.56 --> 6300.52
well i'm not gonna do that

6308.159 --> 6311.159

yeah if you have 5g implants receivers

6573.28 --> 6577.199

gonna interface with that

6577.199 --> 6580.159
okay

yeah but the whole radiation [ __ ]

6585.44 --> 6591.839999999999

6589.199 --> 6593.96
problems for me to just not wanting to

6591.84 --> 6595.52
have it like i have a regular

6593.96 --> 6598.56

radiator having

6604.0 --> 6611.84
having that on me constantly i

6667.36 --> 6673.119
that's cool yeah begging the question

6669.84 --> 6673.119000000001
begging the question ah

6674.4 --> 6678.638999999999
begging the question would be

6676.4 --> 6681.839999999999
something that you probably could

6678.639 --> 6685.119
he could a parrot could memorize

6681.84 --> 6686.719
and it is the foundation isn't it

6685.119 --> 6689.04
for the globe religion so as soon as

6686.719 --> 6691.52
somebody's like talking about balls

6689.04 --> 6694.0
like oh just imagine

6691.52 --> 6695.92
the ball at the start at the distance

6694.0 --> 6699.96
and then paris gonna go bang the

6695.92 --> 6699.96
question begin the question

6713.04 --> 6720.0
yeah you could probably very easy just

6717.679 --> 6721.52
every time balls are brought up

6720.0 --> 6723.199
in a conversation

6721.52 --> 6724.4800000000005
that it's just gonna say begging the

6723.199 --> 6727.919999999999
question

6724.48 --> 6727.919999999999
that would be kind of effective

6729.44 --> 6733.4

wow

6741.04 --> 6748.4

i bet that that wasn't actually recorded

6752.08 --> 6755.119
on conversation

6755.28 --> 6760.239
it sounds like a squirty rumor howard

6763.52 --> 6768.639
maybe like

6765.36 --> 6768.639
q1 on or something

6773.84 --> 6777.32

6877.84 --> 6881.4400000000005
owen benjamin and me might not be

6879.76 --> 6883.360000000001
compatible i think that i would just

6881.44 --> 6886.4
like

6883.36 --> 6886.4
piss owen off

6889.679 --> 6894.4

6969.52 --> 6974.96
with it

6971.679 --> 6977.28
it's like a 47 minute video

6974.96 --> 6979.119
like that guy really makes me think

6977.28 --> 6981.759999999999
sometimes sometimes he's like too

6979.119 --> 6984.32
detailed like too much digging into like

6981.76 --> 6986.08
a very specific section of some fractal

6984.32 --> 6987.92
situation

6986.08 --> 6990.0
and sometimes he's like very over

6987.92 --> 6990.88
generalizing

6990.0 --> 6992.48
but

6990.88 --> 6994.32
he's getting better and better what he

6992.48 --> 6995.5199999999995
does and this one i thought it was

6994.32 --> 6996.96
really

6995.52 --> 7000.76
really good

6996.96 --> 7000.76
so do check it out

7002.48 --> 7006.759999999999
yeah let me find that thumbnail

7023.76 --> 7026.08
hmm

7028.84 --> 7034.719
what oh jimbo has been removing some

7032.0 --> 7034.719
videos that's

7035.199 --> 7038.44
right here

7048.719 --> 7053.36
yeah

7050.56 --> 7054.870000000001
maximum nonsense debate gets feisty yeah

7053.36 --> 7057.5199999999995
i was there in the

7054.87 --> 7059.84
[Music]

7057.52 --> 7059.84
picture

7062.48 --> 7069.598999999999
and it was also in variety

7066.0 --> 7071.199
from was it two days before that

7069.599 --> 7073.84
that was i think the first time that i

7071.199 --> 7073.839999999999
did come on

7076.159 --> 7078.48
right

7082.48 --> 7085.839999999999
yeah so

7083.679 --> 7088.32
definitely interesting yeah matt quantum

7085.84 --> 7091.360000000001
conscious video

7088.32 --> 7093.28
i don't like all of his works

7091.36 --> 7095.679
but

7093.28 --> 7101.32
like some of it is just it is like

7095.679 --> 7101.32
shamanistic i and i really like that

7101.36 --> 7106.08
because he too managed to basically

7103.84 --> 7108.32
reveal like things that are like

7106.08 --> 7109.28
normally slightly outside of even my

7108.32 --> 7112.799999999999
reach

7109.28 --> 7113.759999999999
because of how i focus my journey within

7112.8 --> 7115.52
that

7113.76 --> 7118.4800000000005
he does it slightly differently and then

7115.52 --> 7122.159000000001
he gets to show me things that

7118.48 --> 7124.48
are just for me kind of rare

7122.159 --> 7125.598999999999
and i like it i really appreciate that

7124.48 --> 7127.04
guy

7125.599 --> 7129.84
and i hope he

7127.04 --> 7129.84
he keeps growing

7131.04 --> 7137.84
because he's definitely found a good

7134.96 --> 7140.84
fountain a good spring natural spring of

7137.84 --> 7143.599
inspiration there and focus

7140.84 --> 7146.56
anyway i think i'm gonna

7143.599 --> 7146.56
round out the show

7147.84 --> 7150.8
unless there's something

7151.52 --> 7157.400000000001
else you want me to address and you got

7154.159 --> 7157.4
three minutes

7162.32 --> 7167.679
a little bit of run yeah no but john

7164.4 --> 7169.679
that's the point if that happens

7167.679 --> 7172.639
then it's not yeah

7169.679 --> 7172.639
it's not really

7173.04 --> 7178.08
i don't want to do that

7175.76 --> 7181.599
right i mean if that's going to be this

7178.08 --> 7184.08
scenario i'd much rather be a beta

7181.599 --> 7186.8
i don't want to be

7184.08 --> 7189.04
like a people manager like that

7186.8 --> 7190.8
right i'd rather much sit in with jim

7189.04 --> 7193.44
bob and be like his

7190.8 --> 7196.08
his right hand guy or something

7193.44 --> 7198.5599999999995
i don't want to be like the leader in a

7196.08 --> 7201.119
whole group of people and like random

7198.56 --> 7203.119000000001
guests and i don't want it it's it

7201.119 --> 7205.119
doesn't work for me

7203.119 --> 7209.199
if i'm gonna be like

7205.119 --> 7212.32
the leader of it and i don't want that

7209.199 --> 7215.919999999999
i need my space

7212.32 --> 7218.48
and i don't like especially because

7215.92 --> 7220.96
if there's one thing that really breaks

7218.48 --> 7222.799999999999
me up it's getting rumpus when i'm like

7220.96 --> 7225.44
getting into real

7222.8 --> 7227.599
detailed esoterics if somebody rompers

7225.44 --> 7229.759999999999
me it makes me literally just want to

7227.599 --> 7232.639
rip their throats out

7229.76 --> 7234.4800000000005
when i do that i can't afford for that

7232.639 --> 7237.28
scenario

7234.48 --> 7240.44
to like be a reoccurring thing i can't

7237.28 --> 7240.44
do that

7245.28 --> 7249.84
i have to have like

7247.599 --> 7252.56
a verbal monopoly

7249.84 --> 7255.599
otherwise it i'm gonna be disrupted and

7252.56 --> 7257.1990000000005
i don't that that's something that's

7255.599 --> 7259.360000000001
very bad for me

7257.199 --> 7261.678999999999
when i do this when i've really focused

7259.36 --> 7263.44
like i do like i can't afford to get

7261.679 --> 7266.4800000000005
rumpus i can't afford it

7263.44 --> 7269.48
it's gonna destroy me

7266.48 --> 7269.48
anyway

7271.599 --> 7275.360000000001
and people will want to rumpus me

7273.52 --> 7277.679
because i do kind of tap into things

7275.36 --> 7278.5599999999995
that are very inspiring i suffer the

7277.679 --> 7280.4800000000005
same

7278.56 --> 7282.320000000001
situation with others like when i went

7280.48 --> 7284.799999999999
on gymbomb especially that first time i

7282.32 --> 7285.92
just got like

7284.8 --> 7287.599
i have something to say about this i

7285.92 --> 7289.04
have something available that

7287.599 --> 7290.8
that that like

7289.04 --> 7293.04
yeah that's what people are gonna do

7290.8 --> 7295.04
when you like

7293.04 --> 7297.92
play it high high energy it's gonna

7295.04 --> 7300.48
happen i don't want to deal with that

7297.92 --> 7302.639
i need to be re i need to have

7300.48 --> 7304.799999999999
reassurance that i will not be rumpus

7302.639 --> 7308.32
while i do my thing

7304.8 --> 7308.320000000001
it basically comes down to that

7308.4 --> 7311.92
right but i will definitely

7310.719 --> 7314.96
join

7311.92 --> 7317.76
other streams if they allow me on to

7314.96 --> 7320.2
partake in that more in a beta function

7317.76 --> 7323.35
absolutely

7320.2 --> 7323.349999999999
[Music]

7323.599 --> 7327.52
anyway

7324.719 --> 7329.76
i'm gonna run out

7327.52 --> 7331.52
so yeah show was certainly all over the

7329.76 --> 7333.119000000001
place

7331.52 --> 7334.4800000000005
godzilla

7333.119 --> 7336.5599999999995
situation

7334.48 --> 7338.799999999999
i hope he like

7336.56 --> 7340.4800000000005
he figures it out

7338.8 --> 7343.84
maybe he'll be like no i don't like

7340.48 --> 7345.28
irwin anymore now well that would be

7343.84 --> 7348.32
too bad

7345.28 --> 7350.719
i am gonna prioritize that he gets why

7348.32 --> 7352.88
this happened over whatever he's gonna

7350.719 --> 7354.4800000000005
decide to do it's more important to me

7352.88 --> 7357.679
that he gets it

7354.48 --> 7360.239
than what he's going to do with it

7357.679 --> 7361.92
and yeah if he proves to me that he gets

7360.239 --> 7364.638999999999
it fully

7361.92 --> 7367.84
then i will unban him again

7364.639 --> 7367.84
