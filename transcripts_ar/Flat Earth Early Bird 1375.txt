in here and now you don't know what what

323.639 --> 327.96000000000004

325.56 --> 330.68
what are you doing here Seth will work

[Music]

all right I guess I'll just ignore you

then

368.36 --> 371.559
[Music]

372.9 --> 377.69899999999996
right

374.639 --> 379.74
so yeah yesterday

377.699 --> 381.90000000000003
I thought it was a great show I haven't

379.74 --> 383.759
actually watched it back but I kind of

381.9 --> 386.539
want to

383.759 --> 386.539
uh

387.18 --> 393.24
let's see yeah yesterday I spent some

390.419 --> 397.08
time finishing up watching oh Benjamin

393.24 --> 400.259
including the Alex Stein appearance

397.08 --> 402.71999999999997
I just quite a handful

400.259 --> 404.59000000000003
I mean Alex Stein is such hyperactive

402.72 --> 409.44000000000005
guy

404.59 --> 412.09
[Music]

409.44 --> 417.24
uh

412.09 --> 420.17999999999995
[Music]

417.24 --> 423.199
yeah also Quantum of conscious had a

420.18 --> 423.199
pretty interesting video

423.479 --> 429.539
foreign Body Snatchers like how it was

427.74 --> 430.62
probably riding along the theme that was

429.539 --> 434.15999999999997
going on

430.62 --> 437.039
also because of the guy came on Owen

434.16 --> 440.819
Benjamin and talking about demonology

437.039 --> 441.78
and I was sort of dealing with it too

440.819 --> 445.38
again

441.78 --> 448.61999999999995
I mean I have for quite a while

445.38 --> 450.36
but then he yeah basically applies that

448.62 --> 452.88
concept

450.36 --> 456.24
to his View

452.88 --> 459.36
and compared it so that was it was an

456.24 --> 462.3
interesting show freevoice.io

459.36 --> 465.539
[Music]

462.3 --> 469.56
also QE had some

465.539 --> 471.5
stream apparently but that was like

469.56 --> 474.06
three o'clock at night and I was already

471.5 --> 477.539
gone to bed I went to bed really early

474.06 --> 480.12
this uh this night

477.539 --> 481.979
get some really good rest and that did a

480.12 --> 484.34000000000003
lot of good so I feel actually really

481.979 --> 484.34
strong

486.84 --> 489.5
foreign

491.63 --> 496.319
[Music]

493.74 --> 498.66
I think maybe like all that support I

496.319 --> 501.24
got yesterday was also a big moral boost

498.66 --> 504.3
for me like that's literally

501.24 --> 506.539
measurably good for my health when that

504.3 --> 506.539
happens

506.699 --> 511.759
please keep it coming

509.099 --> 511.759
uh

512.039 --> 516.919
right open that

514.68 --> 516.919
foreign

526.08 --> 532.5
but yeah kiwi did some stream

529.64 --> 535.4399999999999
performance evaluation of Jared I don't

532.5 --> 537.66
know which show he actually did review

535.44 --> 540.0600000000001
if it was like the same one from last

537.66 --> 541.56
time or I don't know man what jiren is

540.06 --> 543.1199999999999
actually doing I don't really follow him

541.56 --> 546.06
anymore

543.12 --> 549.32
but it seems like he's doing multiple of

546.06 --> 552.4799999999999
these types of ridiculous streams

549.32 --> 554.82
continuing to go against the scientific

552.48 --> 557.1
method and all that

554.82 --> 561.09
okay we did like a three hour stream on

557.1 --> 562.8000000000001
this I I watch only snippet of it

561.09 --> 564.12
[Music]

562.8 --> 570.139
uh

564.12 --> 570.139
[Music]

575.55 --> 583.4399999999999
[Music]

579.18 --> 585.8389999999999
oh yeah yeah flat soy I uh I joined flat

583.44 --> 588.6800000000001
side yesterday no wait

585.839 --> 588.6800000000001
that just

591.48 --> 595.5
I'm not sure now

593.519 --> 597.899
there was yesterday it might have been

595.5 --> 599.459
said yeah it says one day ago which is

597.899 --> 601.32
like

599.459 --> 604.92
yeah that probably means it was Saturday

601.32 --> 604.9200000000001
okay uh

605.88 --> 609.4399999999999
but that stream was pretty cool

611.22 --> 614.88
a really

612.959 --> 618.0
really stood out to me like how much

614.88 --> 620.459
better like the sound quality is now

618.0 --> 622.68
flat side streams

620.459 --> 624.8389999999999
ah

622.68 --> 627.18
we're gonna leave watch Jaron well I did

624.839 --> 632.24
kind of used to watch him when he had

627.18 --> 632.2399999999999
like interesting shows like obviously

632.7 --> 635.8100000000001
I've always kind of liked his like space

635.04 --> 639.41
reviews

635.81 --> 639.41
[Music]

639.779 --> 645.66
but yeah in recent times he seems to be

642.779 --> 648.38
much more preoccupied with ether and

645.66 --> 650.88
blabbering on about

648.38 --> 654.24
Nathan and how science doesn't prove

650.88 --> 656.7
anything so it's not interesting

654.24 --> 659.6
anyway hey Alicia

656.7 --> 659.6
good to see you

662.51 --> 665.929
[Music]

798.5 --> 802.339
something that's going on

814.44 --> 817.82
super foggy

817.98 --> 821.4200000000001
all right

819.959 --> 834.549
okay

821.42 --> 834.549
[Music]

854.04 --> 857.04
foreign

863.12 --> 870.24
political update apparently in rush I

867.0 --> 875.279
mean in Italy

870.24 --> 877.38
a right-wing party has won the elections

875.279 --> 880.139
what will that mean

877.38 --> 883.56
we'll find out

880.139 --> 884.83
anyway uh

883.56 --> 889.66
foreign

884.83 --> 889.6600000000001
[Music]

896.1 --> 900.26
what

897.48 --> 900.26
ah

901.38 --> 905.779
all right yeah yeah PJ seen it yeah of

903.66 --> 905.779
course

906.72 --> 911.279
I mean the fisheye lens curvature that

909.24 --> 914.22
they apply is very inconsistent

911.279 --> 916.74
extremely inconsiderate I mean sometimes

914.22 --> 920.4590000000001
it's so bad that it like warps upside

916.74 --> 922.32
down and gets concave and [ __ ] so yeah

920.459 --> 924.4799999999999
yeah

922.32 --> 926.94
in

924.48 --> 928.5600000000001
that should be kind of obvious but I

926.94 --> 931.8000000000001
guess that a lot of people just don't

928.56 --> 935.88
really snap out of the dreamer

931.8 --> 937.92
I think maybe they think

935.88 --> 940.92
like as a form of cognitive dissonance

937.92 --> 944.8199999999999
that when they see the Earth curve in

940.92 --> 946.38
the space footage allegedly that like oh

944.82 --> 948.12
yeah yeah of course that's how it looks

946.38 --> 949.92
and then if it works it's like oh but

948.12 --> 952.5
it's because they're for using fisheye

949.92 --> 955.019
lens that it's warping like that

952.5 --> 957.12
but when it looks like a ball that's

955.019 --> 960.24
actually when it's a ball

957.12 --> 962.66
right I mean that's how Ballwin would

960.24 --> 962.66
see that

967.22 --> 973.5600000000001
[Music]

970.32 --> 976.1800000000001
I can see Earth curve and a lot of a old

973.56 --> 979.55
80s skateboarding what

987.79 --> 993.199

990.48 --> 993.1990000000001
foreign

994.56 --> 1011.779
[Music]

1019.66 --> 1024.9189999999999
maybe yeah maybe it got a little bit too

1022.16 --> 1029.319
cold in this room I do have like my door

1024.919 --> 1029.3190000000002
open for the fresh air but

1029.48 --> 1035.02
cold moist air it kind of enter the room

1032.36 --> 1035.02
because of that

1035.299 --> 1040.16
oh yeah yeah I thought so I thought

1038.059 --> 1043.1
that's what you meant at least G because

1040.16 --> 1044.3600000000001
skateboarders used to have like GoPros

1043.1 --> 1047.559
on their helmets and then everything

1044.36 --> 1047.559
would look kind of curved

1066.08 --> 1069.08
okay

1072.44 --> 1078.46
cool

1074.539 --> 1078.46
hello all right I'll call one more

1082.52 --> 1087.6399999999999
are you are you is that a joke or an

1085.46 --> 1087.64
alcohol

1089.059 --> 1091.66
what

1096.559 --> 1100.34
what

1098.179 --> 1102.44
we're talking about Earth curve here

1100.34 --> 1104.8999999999999
right I mean

1102.44 --> 1107.6000000000001
Barrel Distortion from the lens being

1104.9 --> 1108.6200000000001
the same in order to measure Earth curve

1107.6 --> 1110.36
what

1108.62 --> 1112.1599999999999
hope you realize we're talking about

1110.36 --> 1114.99
Optical

1112.16 --> 1116.24
effects here not actual

1114.99 --> 1117.559
[Music]

1116.24 --> 1120.559
like

1117.559 --> 1120.559
geometry

1122.539 --> 1126.64
it's a very weird thing for you to say

1162.28 --> 1165.42
[Music]

1167.12 --> 1172.099
foreign

1168.9 --> 1172.0990000000002
[Music]

1207.5 --> 1213.44
yeah no [ __ ] since no well we're talking

1210.38 --> 1216.4
you're talking about measuring

1213.44 --> 1216.4
curve

1220.4 --> 1223.0
right

1230.539 --> 1235.82
maybe you just distracted yourself away

1233.179 --> 1237.38
into oh not all lenses are the same I

1235.82 --> 1239.299
mean it's a good little distraction to

1237.38 --> 1240.679
get away from the fact that there is no

1239.299 --> 1244.46
actual

1240.679 --> 1246.44
Earth curve to be measured ever

1244.46 --> 1251.0
fine

1246.44 --> 1252.78
pull that mental gymnastics for yourself

1251.0 --> 1259.619

the Dutch

1408.74 --> 1411.7
really seems like

like the uh

1414.74 --> 1421.28
the the mainstream news groups are

1417.679 --> 1423.799
getting like really insane now they're

1421.28 --> 1427.039

basically like a

1825.38 --> 1833.0
creepy inter-dimensional little course

1829.58 --> 1836.539
it's kind of bizarre where I basically

1833.0 --> 1839.899
laid out like how do you actually

1836.539 --> 1842.779
take it over and that's not a revolt and

1839.899 --> 1845.7199999999998
it's not a protest either

1842.779 --> 1849.74
so I actually laid it out my views on

1845.72 --> 1854.559
how it could conceivably be

1849.74 --> 1854.559
done that's not a revolt

1858.2 --> 1861.279
it's a revolution

1863.179 --> 1868.3990000000001
that is exactly what they want they're

you gonna do with the Revolt you're

gonna break down the systems that's what

1871.82 --> 1875.539
they want

1872.72 --> 1878.419
yeah a Revolt only works

1875.539 --> 1881.6
and a protest if they have something to

1878.419 --> 1885.8200000000002
lose if they have vested interest in the

1977.779 --> 1982.64
the streets to tell people

it just means that you have to be able

2144.22 --> 2148.359
it's developing in that age

isolated from the world didn't have like

electric communication or anything and

they would have plenty of kids but those

not be super communicatively developed

2174.16 --> 2179.3199999999997
it would be fine

2179.32 --> 2185.1400000000003
other and nobody in the family would be

2181.18 --> 2185.56

eloquent with language well the the kids

2199.48 --> 2204.579
being in a world suddenly where

2202.06 --> 2210.0
everybody's wearing a mask has the same

2204.579 --> 2210.0
effect as that they just don't develop

2322.18 --> 2327.8999999999996
they do with absolutely everything that

2324.82 --> 2327.9
you can ever come up with

2328.0 --> 2335.2
so there would have to be a post

2330.96 --> 2337.98
takedown in initiate

2335.2 --> 2337.98
initiative

2339.339 --> 2344.619
right

2341.02 --> 2346.18
get them out take over declare cultural

2344.619 --> 2349.619
Marxism

2346.18 --> 2349.6189999999997
to be terrorism

2349.9 --> 2354.52
because if you're gonna just yell that

2351.88 --> 2356.44
at them they're gonna then call you the

2354.52 --> 2357.88
cultural Marxist and declare you a

2356.44 --> 2359.14
terrorist and then come after you

2357.88 --> 2361.839
because that's what they do they're

2359.14 --> 2367.24
satanists that's what cultural Marxism

2361.839 --> 2367.24
Marx CSR there are 100 satanists

2367.48 --> 2372.88
they're the most satanic

it was a man

2451.96 --> 2455.859
like a school where they teach his [ __ ]

2496.53 --> 2502.8390000000004
[Music]

2500.26 --> 2505.119
all right but it has no point even like

2502.839 --> 2508.359
thinking about this

2505.119 --> 2510.6400000000003
as long as yeah it's not under control I

2508.359 --> 2514.119
mean you're not gonna as a hostile Force

2510.64 --> 2517.1189999999997
move in then in there and bomb it that's

2514.119 --> 2520.3
literally going to just create War

2517.119 --> 2524.38
so yeah if actual War breaks out and it

2520.3 --> 2527.079
might with Russia yeah a more open War

2524.38 --> 2528.76
not just Regional

2527.079 --> 2530.6800000000003
um

2528.76 --> 2534.0400000000004
there's all kinds of things that might

2530.68 --> 2536.56
happen when that happens because

2534.04 --> 2539.14
Russia could just do something like that

2536.56 --> 2541.839
they could literally just

2539.14 --> 2544.1189999999997
send in one of their

2541.839 --> 2547.7799999999997
I don't know what they have

2544.119 --> 2550.599
hyper fast missiles or Barefoot kind of

2547.78 --> 2554.02
stealth planes and literally just bomb

2550.599 --> 2557.02
the school as a direct symbol

2554.02 --> 2559.119
or maybe that's going to happen after

2557.02 --> 2560.2599999999998
Russia gets bombed because I think that

2559.119 --> 2563.32
probably

2560.26 --> 2566.32
as this escalation happens and more

2563.32 --> 2568.9900000000002
groups are going to get involved

2566.32 --> 2570.88
it's very likely that

[Music]

2570.88 --> 2577.2000000000003
Europe America will actually start

2573.82 --> 2577.2000000000003
bombing Russia first

2578.26 --> 2581.28
or try it

2582.4 --> 2587.38
not talking about nukes

2585.28 --> 2590.92
because those don't exist

2587.38 --> 2594.1600000000003
but like missiles and all that

2590.92 --> 2596.579
and or stealth or however they're gonna

2594.16 --> 2596.5789999999997
do it

2597.64 --> 2603.339
right maybe they'll find ways to like

2599.92 --> 2604.78
use planes that just literally fry Sam

2603.339 --> 2608.14
systems

2604.78 --> 2610.42
like they could yeah who knows what's

2608.14 --> 2612.339
out there technological wise they might

2610.42 --> 2614.26
be able to get past it bump some [ __ ]

2612.339 --> 2618.359
well you could bet your ass Russia is

2614.26 --> 2622.5
gonna then retaliate and hit key targets

2618.359 --> 2622.5
especially symbolic targets

2622.54 --> 2625.48
and yeah

2623.8 --> 2628.619
that place

2625.48 --> 2628.619
that Marxist

2629.2 --> 2633.819
is it building school what the hell that

2631.72 --> 2636.24
is it might become a target one of those

2633.819 --> 2638.56

2636.24 --> 2642.64
at the root

2638.56 --> 2645.54
of this entire movement this wef

2642.64 --> 2648.24

2645.54 --> 2651.64
an ancestor

2648.24 --> 2653.9799999999996

a long time ago

2653.98 --> 2657.099
to Schwab

2655.839 --> 2659.74
so

2657.099 --> 2662.8
but they are literally the same family

2659.74 --> 2664.4199999999996

2662.8 --> 2667.7200000000003
Marxist

2664.42 --> 2670.319

something to talk about it is relevant

want to hear about that okay

uh turkey Porky sorry but

2835.98 --> 2839.579
uh technology

2841.72 --> 2846.9399999999996
I mean I'm not saying that the hot war

2843.88 --> 2850.26
will last very long this is not like the

2846.94 --> 2850.26
18th century or something

2850.9 --> 2853.56
but

2856.48 --> 2861.04
it's not like oh we need more men

2859.119 --> 2864.099
they're just gonna get shot one by one

2861.04 --> 2865.48
and we need more no no it doesn't work

2864.099 --> 2866.8590000000004
like that anymore

2865.48 --> 2869.339
I mean there's still going to be

2866.859 --> 2869.339
necessary

2869.38 --> 2873.6600000000003
but there's a lot of technology so

2877.119 --> 2883.7400000000002
let's seek his Taurus Russia started

2879.46 --> 2883.7400000000002
tossing tactical nukes yet no

2885.94 --> 2890.8
they don't

2887.56 --> 2892.599
have any neither does anybody else

2890.8 --> 2894.819
but I'm pretty sure that they can

2892.599 --> 2899.6400000000003
actually send a missile somewhere very

2894.819 --> 2899.64
fast that has a very big explosion

2900.579 --> 2906.94
don't know if they'd have like a lot of

2903.52 --> 2910.18
those probably very expensive right the

2906.94 --> 2913.18
idea of nuclear weapons was is that oh

2910.18 --> 2916.48
it's relatively so cheap to get such an

2913.18 --> 2920.319
insane lot sized explosion

2916.48 --> 2922.359
right if you then don't have that yeah

2920.319 --> 2926.56
then you actually have to fill it up

2922.359 --> 2931.02
with explosives and refined and oh yeah

2926.56 --> 2931.02
so it's going to be just very costly

2947.339 --> 2953.099
last 11 years

2950.14 --> 2953.0989999999997
okay

2958.119 --> 2961.839
okay right but the thing is though is

2960.16 --> 2964.06
that

2961.839 --> 2966.4
they don't necessarily have to have them

2964.06 --> 2969.88
built and stacked

2966.4 --> 2972.88
I mean they might have some but yeah

2969.88 --> 2974.38
if they just have the factory ready to

2972.88 --> 2977.26
assemble it all

2974.38 --> 2979.3
and might be able to last a lot longer

2977.26 --> 2983.0400000000004
you can just build them

2979.3 --> 2983.04
quickly when they need it

2983.2 --> 2987.819
right and they're not going to have the

2985.78 --> 2990.099
same issues as like with nuclear weapons

2987.819 --> 2993.54

tolkien's works because if one thing you

4220.88 --> 4226.3
could say about Tolkien is

4223.58 --> 4229.04
that he was extremely descriptive

4226.3 --> 4230.659000000001
extremely we would literally like spend

4229.04 --> 4234.92
half a page

4230.659 --> 4238.5199999999995
at some point to describe a jewel that

4234.92 --> 4241.0
some character was wearing okay

4238.52 --> 4241.0
yeah

4241.28 --> 4248.679
he was very descriptive and he used the

4243.98 --> 4248.678999999999
words fair skin plenty of times

4250.699 --> 4254.9
right and by the way

4252.86 --> 4257.5599999999995
just for the record the kind of were

black people

4258.02 --> 4263.719
it's like Yeah from the East I forget

4261.92 --> 4265.58

4268.76 --> 4272.659000000001
they were black

4270.32 --> 4275.659

4272.659 --> 4280.28
are black figures

4275.659 --> 4283.48
black braces in Turkey they're just kind

4280.28 --> 4283.48
of on the other side of the world

4285.199 --> 4291.159
they're probably sort of symbolic in a

way of like the Moors or something

4761.6 --> 4765.4400000000005
something else instead or they're gonna

4763.82 --> 4769.12
like okay we're gonna do it and then it

4765.44 --> 4769.12
blows up like on the ground

4769.34 --> 4775.5
but it's not gonna fly

4771.739 --> 4779.3589999999995

5023.04 --> 5029.58
see trunis he just calculate calculates

5026.739 --> 5033.218999999999
it I mean Professor philbel probably

5029.58 --> 5036.699
doesn't get out much ever

5033.219 --> 5039.1
so it just calculates everything he's

5036.699 --> 5043.5599999999995
just a calculator he's just using the

5039.1 --> 5043.56
calculations that's how you do it

5043.96 --> 5047.64
just calculates everything

5048.58 --> 5053.199
that makes it real right if you can

5050.86 --> 5054.88
calculate it and you have a computer

5053.199 --> 5057.699
program

5054.88 --> 5058.96
made by people that make a lot of money

5057.699 --> 5062.678999999999
over that

5058.96 --> 5066.4
that tell you oh these are real things

5062.679 --> 5069.34
we're just using these calculations and

5066.4 --> 5072.58
you can use these calculations too

5069.34 --> 5074.8
and that'll make it real

5072.58 --> 5076.12
and yeah it seems like Professor Phil

5074.8 --> 5079.56
was

5076.12 --> 5079.5599999999995
very much into that

5093.219 --> 5098.34
to control thrusters yes I'm sure you do

5099.58 --> 5107.0199999999995
have you ever actually seen

5103.239 --> 5109.599999999999
like a result of your control that you

5107.02 --> 5111.820000000001
like literally see a physical thing not

5109.6 --> 5114.820000000001
just a stupid computer program again

5111.82 --> 5118.42
yeah I mean I can control the thrust too

5114.82 --> 5122.199
of a rocket in a computer game I press

5118.42 --> 5124.36
the button and look oh so real yes but

5122.199 --> 5127.419999999999
did you actually ever see a real

5124.36 --> 5130.38
physical rocket and then had a control

5127.42 --> 5130.38
where you could like

5131.76 --> 5136.360000000001
have you ever done that

5134.08 --> 5138.64
with an actual

5136.36 --> 5140.32
thing

5138.64 --> 5142.2390000000005
I kind of doubt it

5140.32 --> 5144.159
I think you've mostly been staring at

5142.239 --> 5145.718999999999
computer screens and just presupposing

5144.159 --> 5147.759999999999
it's all real

5145.719 --> 5150.42
dude what are you doing

5147.76 --> 5150.42
turret

5153.52 --> 5156.719
what the [ __ ] are you doing

5167.08 --> 5170.08
foreign

5176.159 --> 5180.82
would pay the Prof if his satellites

5179.08 --> 5182.86
didn't work

5180.82 --> 5185.62
no no they would

5182.86 --> 5187.9
besides he doesn't have any satellites

5185.62 --> 5190.0599999999995
and it's actually it's much cheaper than

5187.9 --> 5191.799999999999
you'd think to just have

5190.06 --> 5194.9800000000005
radio contact

5191.8 --> 5198.1
satellite is just theatrics

5194.98 --> 5199.959999999999
to make it seem like it's much more

5198.1 --> 5202.2390000000005
expensive than it really is that's where

5199.96 --> 5204.639
all the profits come from

5202.239 --> 5206.379999999999
and Professor Phil is just a part of

5204.639 --> 5209.9800000000005
that theatrics and he doesn't even know

5206.38 --> 5212.92
it he's a shield for satellites

5209.98 --> 5215.5199999999995
and he doesn't even realize that that is

5212.92 --> 5215.52
the case

5216.639 --> 5223.86
yes he ends up exactly where he needed

5219.639 --> 5228.0
to be according to the computer screen

5223.86 --> 5230.0199999999995
yes a computer screen look at the screen

5228.0 --> 5233.86
so real

5230.02 --> 5237.76
it uses the calculations too

5233.86 --> 5241.36
and I can use the calculations

5237.76 --> 5245.58
so I could change things on the computer

5241.36 --> 5245.58
screen this makes it real

5278.5 --> 5284.5
they've been yapping back and forth with

5281.739 --> 5287.678999999999
Professor Phil for like an hour they

5284.5 --> 5289.0
started doing it not me

5287.679 --> 5292.0
I was trying to have another

5289.0 --> 5294.699
conversation but no Professor Phil well

5292.0 --> 5296.92
is so much more interesting to keep

5294.699 --> 5299.919999999999
poking like a whack-a-mole that never

5296.92 --> 5301.2390000000005
stops you know he will never stop but I

5299.92 --> 5305.26
guess that's more interesting than

5301.239 --> 5306.82
hearing Darwin out on things

5305.26 --> 5309.159000000001
and all that

5306.82 --> 5312.48
I mean why inquire where you could just

5309.159 --> 5312.48
blabber on in my chat

5313.179 --> 5317.86
with somebody that will never learn and

5315.94 --> 5320.799999999999
you know he will never learn because

5317.86 --> 5323.0199999999995
he's been doing it in my chat for over a

5320.8 --> 5325.42
year now and he never learns he always

5323.02 --> 5328.360000000001
falls back to the same position says the

5325.42 --> 5331.12
same things you can never convince him

5328.36 --> 5333.639
you can make a hour hangout with all of

5331.12 --> 5336.099999999999
you verbally doing that

5333.639 --> 5337.36
and he will not make the slightest of

5336.1 --> 5339.76
difference

5337.36 --> 5342.5199999999995
because this is a man that's locked into

5339.76 --> 5345.12
his dream and he's never gonna snap out

5342.52 --> 5345.120000000001

they will not move an inch no matter how

5597.159 --> 5601.44
much different from Jehovah's Witness

5601.659 --> 5606.82
it isn't

5604.12 --> 5609.159
it it's just they have their story they

5606.82 --> 5611.739
can't evade they break down as soon as

5609.159 --> 5613.48
they try they can't do it so they're

this is what they do

5628.6 --> 5633.6990000000005
can't let it go so they're just gonna

5631.12 --> 5637.36
roll out the response to that program

5633.699 --> 5638.98
the rest of their life until they die

5637.36 --> 5641.44

5641.44 --> 5647.32
for them to look away that it was all a

foreign

5790.84 --> 5794.68
[Music]

5801.699 --> 5807.78
yeah I mean you can have some momentum

5804.88 --> 5807.78
virtually

5808.48 --> 5813.5199999999995
in a low pressure situation which would

5811.9 --> 5815.5599999999995
be considered a vacuum

5813.52 --> 5818.400000000001
there's there's no end of relative

5815.56 --> 5818.400000000001
density though

5818.8 --> 5825.159000000001
yeah

5820.179 --> 5828.159
and the thing is once you Attain

5825.159 --> 5831.339999999999
this position where there is basically

5828.159 --> 5834.5199999999995
no more gas around you to press upon

5831.34 --> 5837.46
then the rocket yeah it might retain

5834.52 --> 5840.400000000001
whatever momentum it had but it can't

5837.46 --> 5842.5
add to that anymore

5840.4 --> 5843.699
because if it's just gonna fire its

5842.5 --> 5847.6
rocket

5843.699 --> 5850.78
the vacuum will literally just pull all

5847.6 --> 5853.6
of the combusted gases out instantly

5850.78 --> 5856.239
without it having any footing or

5853.6 --> 5860.56
anything to press upon so at best what's

5856.239 --> 5863.62
gonna be caused is the rocket having a

5860.56 --> 5866.139
momentum already in the vacuum whatever

5863.62 --> 5868.12
it's just gonna spin wild it's gonna

5866.139 --> 5870.219
just lose its balance it's not gonna

5868.12 --> 5871.48
actually push against anything it's just

5870.219 --> 5874.84
like a

5871.48 --> 5876.759999999999
a gas tank just opening up

5874.84 --> 5879.400000000001
it's not gonna push against anything

5876.76 --> 5880.96
because thrust

5879.4 --> 5886.42
yeah like

5880.96 --> 5889.12
jet engine of an airplane or a missile

5886.42 --> 5891.6990000000005
it's built on thrusts what is thrust

5889.12 --> 5894.46
thrust is extremely high grass pressure

5891.699 --> 5896.678999999999
being created locally

5894.46 --> 5899.7390000000005
that's gonna then push against the

5896.679 --> 5901.719
existing gas pressure that surrounds it

5899.739 --> 5904.178999999999
that way

5901.719 --> 5906.58
going to create extra pressure behind it

5904.179 --> 5910.92
and then thrust it forward

5906.58 --> 5910.92
well if there's no gas to press against

5911.56 --> 5917.320000000001
like in the container

5914.38 --> 5919.4800000000005
it's not gonna build that thrust

5917.32 --> 5922.239
pressure it's just gonna vent off in all

5919.48 --> 5924.12
directions disperse instantly

5922.239 --> 5927.218999999999
it's not going to be able to actually

5924.12 --> 5929.679
displace itself or add to whatever

5927.219 --> 5932.46
momentum it had because there's nothing

5929.679 --> 5932.46
to press against

5934.38 --> 5941.08
Rockets don't push off air yes they do

5937.48 --> 5943.799999999999
you unbelievable [ __ ] [ __ ] get the

5941.08 --> 5943.8
[ __ ] out of here

5943.9 --> 5949.86
sock account [ __ ]

5946.3 --> 5949.860000000001
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

5951.219 --> 5954.42
you don't know anything

5956.679 --> 5965.6990000000005
you can't press against gas that you

5961.48 --> 5968.98
literally created locally

5965.699 --> 5972.339999999999
that doesn't work because it will simply

5968.98 --> 5973.54
carry on that pressure to their

5972.34 --> 5975.46
surrounding

5973.54 --> 5977.5
oh guess what there is no pressure there

5975.46 --> 5980.62
because it's a vacuum so it's just gonna

5977.5 --> 5983.08
keep moving in all directions not

5980.62 --> 5986.44
building pressure

5983.08 --> 5988.78
until well there is enough gas pressure

5986.44 --> 5990.94
I built up to suddenly build up that

5988.78 --> 5994.3
thrust pressure yeah that's not gonna

5990.94 --> 5997.419999999999
happen in an infinite vacuum

5994.3 --> 6000.42
where the gas that created by the rocket

5997.42 --> 6004.02
will never be sufficient to fill up the

6000.42 --> 6007.679
entire [ __ ] Galaxy to get some thrust

6004.02 --> 6010.02
so it's just gonna wildly spray

6007.679 --> 6012.179
that explosive gas pressure in all

6010.02 --> 6014.400000000001
Direction and is never actually going to

6012.179 --> 6017.4800000000005
build up thrust that's what happens with

6014.4 --> 6017.48
rockets in a vacuum

6018.06 --> 6022.860000000001
you need gas pressure to have thrust

6020.82 --> 6026.63
from rocketry

6022.86 --> 6035.209
and that's a fact that's physics fact

6026.63 --> 6035.209
[Music]

6035.28 --> 6039.38
if I have to tell you that then you

6037.44 --> 6043.5199999999995
don't belong here okumu virus you

6039.38 --> 6043.52
unbelievable [ __ ] [ __ ]

6065.51 --> 6068.64
[Music]

6069.78 --> 6072.739
foreign

6076.62 --> 6083.04
or a bunch of Patty little soccer counts

6079.8 --> 6084.360000000001
[ __ ] retards I mean you're all 80 IQ

6083.04 --> 6087.06
and less

6084.36 --> 6089.639
you're too [ __ ] stupid to literally

6087.06 --> 6093.4400000000005
make out what things mean that you

6089.639 --> 6093.4400000000005
believe in you're that [ __ ] dumb

6093.9 --> 6099.42
so just drown in your [ __ ] chance

6097.139 --> 6100.32
that you literally don't know what they

6099.42 --> 6103.1990000000005
mean

6100.32 --> 6105.44
while I explained to you how are you are

6103.199 --> 6105.44
wrong

6106.44 --> 6113.099999999999
and you don't listen you just [ __ ] out

6109.92 --> 6115.1990000000005
more ridicule to hide to mask how

6113.1 --> 6118.52
[ __ ] embarrassed you are for your

6115.199 --> 6118.5199999999995
utter retardation

[Music]

6170.659 --> 6175.138999999999
all right

6172.679 --> 6177.719
but I'm gonna round out the show pretty

6175.139 --> 6180.119
soon I think

6177.719 --> 6182.36
it's just a bunch of numpties rolling in

6180.119 --> 6182.36
oh

6183.64 --> 6186.759
[Music]

6189.6 --> 6195.179
I'm out I might run out a little early

6191.699 --> 6200.0
so I can just rush and do groceries

6195.179 --> 6200.0
and not miss miss most of the live show

6203.159 --> 6207.95
um

6204.36 --> 6207.95
[Music]

6222.86 --> 6226.82
it's not really funny

6226.92 --> 6229.82
not really

6230.1 --> 6236.58
ah Nathan just threw out the link so

6232.26 --> 6239.58
there's gonna be a live show on FD great

6236.58 --> 6239.58
foreign

6249.63 --> 6252.76
[Music]

6254.4 --> 6257.119
do

6265.679 --> 6270.92
I'm trying to get the [ __ ] out of here

6267.6 --> 6270.92
you numpy [ __ ]

6271.159 --> 6276.48
indoctrinated [ __ ] little [ __ ]

6274.199 --> 6278.099999999999
don't care how [ __ ] smart You Think

6276.48 --> 6281.159
You Are

6278.1 --> 6282.659000000001
you oppose me in my argumentation you

6281.159 --> 6285.98
are wrong and you're a [ __ ]

6282.659 --> 6285.98
delusional [ __ ]

6287.1 --> 6294.719
yeah even if you actually manage to

6289.86 --> 6298.08
sound smarter than the average adiq

6294.719 --> 6303.7390000000005
you can still be an utter [ __ ] by

6298.08 --> 6303.739
simply refuting natural physics facts

6303.84 --> 6306.84
foreign

6316.02 --> 6320.76
yeah I'm gonna round up

6318.239 --> 6323.58
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6320.76 --> 6326.52
like this 60 yeah but 60 IQ people

6323.58 --> 6329.179
usually like are just unable to properly

6326.52 --> 6329.179
communicate

6329.36 --> 6335.04
adiqs can

6331.86 --> 6336.119
still somewhat comprehensively formulate

6335.04 --> 6339.08
things

6336.119 --> 6339.08
usually

6339.54 --> 6345.32
60 IQ is often like have serious trouble

6342.78 --> 6345.32
speaking

6347.52 --> 6353.52
so and typing right anyway thanks

6351.6 --> 6355.34
everyone for coming I hope you liked

6353.52 --> 6358.38
this show it was kind of over the place

6355.34 --> 6359.159000000001
a lot of back and forth a lot of Flat

6358.38 --> 6361.02
Earth

6359.159 --> 6363.42
subject I guess

6361.02 --> 6366.719
back and forth with the ball tards in

6363.42 --> 6369.6
chat who I still do appreciate even

6366.719 --> 6372.54
though yeah I I personally more annoyed

6369.6 --> 6374.1
with you guys constantly just going at

6372.54 --> 6377.84
him

6374.1 --> 6377.84
like a bunch of hungry dogs

6378.659 --> 6384.839999999999
because they're it's just whack-a-mole

6381.78 --> 6386.639
that is it that's all there is like

6384.84 --> 6388.860000000001
you're not gonna win a prize at the end

6386.639 --> 6392.04
for doing it you do realize that right

6388.86 --> 6393.96
you're not gonna win a prize for going

6392.04 --> 6397.44
at it with them

6393.96 --> 6401.159
both Professor Phil will and and akumu

6397.44 --> 6403.5599999999995
virus so keep that in mind next time

6401.159 --> 6406.0199999999995
you feel like going at it

6403.56 --> 6407.639
realize it it doesn't actually amount to

6406.02 --> 6411.6
anything because they'll never change

6407.639 --> 6415.32
they never will you know that by now or

6411.6 --> 6417.54
that you should anyway right so

6415.32 --> 6419.82

6440.04 --> 6445.199
use it so please don't think just

6442.38 --> 6447.900000000001
because I got someone a good day

6445.199 --> 6449.699
that I stopped needing it

6447.9 --> 6451.98
I do need

6449.699 --> 6455.159
I very much do and there was a long

6451.98 --> 6456.48
drive period before that so please keep

it coming

6456.48 --> 6460.799999999999
right

6458.42 --> 6462.32
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

6460.8 --> 6465.179
early bird number

6462.32 --> 6467.5199999999995
1376 on a Tuesday and I'm gonna join the

6465.179 --> 6469.4400000000005
Flat Earth debates although I might not

6467.52 --> 6471.42
be appearing like the first part because

6469.44 --> 6475.099999999999
I am gonna go out for groceries now that

6471.42 --> 6475.1
it's finally dry for a few seconds

6475.619 --> 6481.44
ah hope to see you all there in chat

6478.98 --> 6483.78
over at Nathan Oakley 1980 Channel which

6481.44 --> 6485.699
is startup live show in about 10 minutes

6483.78 --> 6488.5199999999995
although there's already the pre-show

6485.699 --> 6489.78
recording so you could get unguild it

6488.52 --> 6491.639
and follow that

6489.78 --> 6495.36
if you wanted to

6491.639 --> 6495.36
right uh

6497.04 --> 6502.86
right so until the next video keep it

6500.52 --> 6521.219
flat
