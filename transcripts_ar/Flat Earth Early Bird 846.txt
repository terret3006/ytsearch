cloudy and very windy

it's yeah not a very sunny Sunday today

93.42 --> 98.7
and just constant

96.659 --> 101.64
wind out there

98.7 --> 104.78
Birds riding it

101.64 --> 104.78
Riding the Storm

107.28 --> 111.72
and yeah it's not exactly warm because

110.52 --> 114.6
of that

111.72 --> 117.5
because of the wind

114.6 --> 117.5
so yeah

129.959 --> 132.959
right

140.52 --> 148.76000000000002
right

142.62 --> 153.68
today Sunday the 28th of March 2021

148.76 --> 153.67999999999998
month March it's almost over

157.22 --> 163.14
I got up pretty late today

160.739 --> 165.12
as in a half hour before the show

163.14 --> 168.29999999999998
started

165.12 --> 172.98000000000002
but I I really needed to sleep and it

168.3 --> 174.42000000000002
did get kind of late yesterday night so

172.98 --> 177.42
ah

174.42 --> 179.7
no t as a consequence unfortunately but

177.42 --> 183.61999999999998
it's just a one hour show so I'm gonna

179.7 --> 183.61999999999998
have to do without for this hour

183.959 --> 188.36
that'll be fine I did have my coffee

192.239 --> 194.72
yesterday

194.819 --> 200.76
yeah there was a ball busters live

197.459 --> 204.08
I did get in there but

200.76 --> 207.0
was not Super Active

204.08 --> 209.4
uh afterward though I did have some nice

207.0 --> 212.36
conversations with the guys after the

209.4 --> 212.36
show had rounded out

213.12 --> 215.94
uh

214.379 --> 217.7
and yeah

215.94 --> 222.0
Neil

217.7 --> 226.57999999999998
recommended this Siri to me new casino

222.0 --> 226.58
behind their eyes I think it was Neil

226.92 --> 234.11999999999998
so yeah I kind of got into that

231.06 --> 235.98
started watching that got five episodes

234.12 --> 237.959
in

235.98 --> 241.28
and

237.959 --> 244.62
I think that's what kind of kept me up

241.28 --> 247.5
but it was very interesting

244.62 --> 249.18
in many ways it started out like really

247.5 --> 252.0
agitating me

249.18 --> 255.18
really the series just the

252.0 --> 258.919
the things that are happening the people

255.18 --> 258.919
and the decisions they make

259.5 --> 264.84
almost felt kind of played like certain

262.199 --> 267.36
things were normalized that I feel

264.84 --> 271.08
shouldn't have bitten

267.36 --> 272.22
but then the series got basically more

271.08 --> 275.88
into

272.22 --> 278.1
the Ethereal stuff that it is about and

275.88 --> 281.46
it is a lot about astral projection and

278.1 --> 284.28000000000003
it's really like part of the plot

281.46 --> 288.12
and that was interesting and also very

284.28 --> 288.11999999999995
interestingly expressed

288.72 --> 293.1
and yeah one thing that really stood out

291.0 --> 295.8
to me in the series is that the music

293.1 --> 297.90000000000003
the atmosphere was really done really

295.8 --> 299.34000000000003
well

297.9 --> 303.06
so

299.34 --> 305.28
yeah it's a pretty interesting Series so

303.06 --> 309.12
far it's just one season

305.28 --> 312.05999999999995
and I'm already through it almost

309.12 --> 315.6
just a couple of more episodes

312.06 --> 315.6
right uh

323.96 --> 328.94
hello fowlan Buchanan first in chat

330.96 --> 333.85999999999996
good to see you

336.419 --> 339.08
all right

345.06 --> 348.06
hmm

358.02 --> 363.139
but yeah that series kind of kept me

360.72 --> 363.139
busy

368.34 --> 373.63899999999995
it's kind of funny because I think that

370.5 --> 376.259
maybe like my friend and name also

373.639 --> 378.36
recommended it to me I'm not entirely

376.259 --> 380.88
sure but I think that

378.36 --> 384.0
in the last period several people have

380.88 --> 387.0
recommended it to me

384.0 --> 388.8
because like when Neil said it it felt

387.0 --> 391.199
like hey

388.8 --> 394.62
I've been recommended it before the name

391.199 --> 398.039
is familiar somehow

394.62 --> 401.84000000000003
right a drunken bullet 4-1-1

398.039 --> 401.84
to the show in chat

403.44 --> 407.539
hmm

405.36 --> 407.539
foreign

410.539 --> 415.02
is pretty intense

415.34 --> 420.19899999999996
literally tensions and stuff and

421.68 --> 428.039
really a lot about just really bad

424.86 --> 430.68
social behavior in many ways just like

428.039 --> 433.31899999999996
it was a mess like

430.68 --> 435.72
especially at the first parts of the

433.319 --> 438.199
series I just got like really agitated

435.72 --> 438.199
like

438.66 --> 444.78000000000003
I felt it's weird man it yeah I gotta

442.68 --> 447.18
finish through it but it at first I like

444.78 --> 450.35999999999996
felt manipulated by it like how it was

447.18 --> 452.58
just like saying like no no that's

450.36 --> 456.36
that's sort of normal and natural

452.58 --> 457.8
through music suggestion I guess in ways

456.36 --> 459.18
they would yeah they were just playing

457.8 --> 461.94
it out

459.18 --> 464.879
in a more natural fashion but the whole

461.94 --> 467.3
thing just stinks

464.879 --> 467.3
the

468.06 --> 473.94
as in the way

470.4 --> 475.85999999999996
they're all going about just wrong

473.94 --> 478.08
there's like sin in this series

475.86 --> 480.599
definitely

478.08 --> 483.0
it's not addressed as far as it should

480.599 --> 485.46
be but at the same time yeah when you

483.0 --> 486.72
get into more the story element

485.46 --> 489.78
of it

486.72 --> 492.66
then that part is interesting all these

489.78 --> 494.46
individuals and their own

492.66 --> 496.56
one thing that kind of stood out to me

494.46 --> 499.08
is that everybody's being shown like

496.56 --> 502.139
really from their own perspective like

499.08 --> 503.52
they try to express

502.139 --> 506.78000000000003
everybody

503.52 --> 506.78
and how they are

507.06 --> 513.24
they pay attention to that

510.419 --> 516.659
so that you get a pretty close-up feel

513.24 --> 519.62
for what their character really is like

516.659 --> 519.62
anyway

519.779 --> 524.159
I'm still a little bit filled up with

521.64 --> 526.74
that series and excited like oh yeah

524.159 --> 530.54
yeah the rest of the episodes probably

526.74 --> 530.54
gonna finish that up tonight

532.86 --> 538.16
it's been a kind of a good distraction I

535.62 --> 538.16
needed that

541.74 --> 547.26
to kind of get out of the mud situation

545.519 --> 551.12
for myself

547.26 --> 551.12
because I've been really dragged down

551.779 --> 555.86
in the recent days

556.62 --> 562.14
oh yeah one thing kind of like bodily

559.62 --> 564.24
maintenance like I've had issues with my

562.14 --> 566.279
shoulder right well I figured out like

564.24 --> 568.86
wait

566.279 --> 572.3389999999999
should have figured it out before but

568.86 --> 574.5
like if I just start instead of like on

572.339 --> 577.3800000000001
where it hurts

574.5 --> 579.66
if I get to the other side

577.38 --> 581.58
let's see what happens when I massage it

579.66 --> 583.019
over there and that actually worked

581.58 --> 585.839
better

583.019 --> 588.24
so I think I figured out now just what

585.839 --> 592.6800000000001
how this works

588.24 --> 595.44
it's like it's really sourced from

592.68 --> 599.279
I guess uh

595.44 --> 602.0400000000001
weight experience and I seem to carry it

599.279 --> 604.019
more with my right shoulder but there

602.04 --> 607.4399999999999
it's kind of locked up so I don't feel

604.019 --> 610.38
it but that energy

607.44 --> 613.2
tightening is radiating off and that's

610.38 --> 615.0
why eventually my left shoulder starts

613.2 --> 617.1
to kind of compensate for it and that's

615.0 --> 619.86
what causing it

617.1 --> 621.48
right so that's yeah should have figured

619.86 --> 622.86
that out earlier because I know this

621.48 --> 624.36
sort of thing and how that typically

622.86 --> 626.04
works I should have figured that out

624.36 --> 628.5600000000001
before

626.04 --> 631.38
but now I think I have a more successful

628.56 --> 632.76
strategy to really move it out of my

631.38 --> 636.959
system

632.76 --> 639.779
by just going to the right part

636.959 --> 641.16
it is weird though because it is tense

639.779 --> 643.26
here

641.16 --> 645.779
but I don't feel it when I don't pay

643.26 --> 648.86
attention to it instead I feel instead I

645.779 --> 648.86
feel it on the left side

650.579 --> 655.88
sounds like an inbound yeah but that's

652.44 --> 655.8800000000001
always how it works it's

657.0 --> 663.36
just one part somewhere has a lot of

660.0 --> 664.98
tension it locks up slightly or very

663.36 --> 666.48
badly

664.98 --> 669.4200000000001
and then

666.48 --> 672.0600000000001
well you don't always have to actually

669.42 --> 676.6999999999999
feel that like the feelings of it can

672.06 --> 676.6999999999999
sort of be be locked off by accident

677.04 --> 681.42
because you're gonna used to locking it

679.2 --> 683.399
off in order to keep going

681.42 --> 685.68
but then

683.399 --> 688.32
it sort of hides

685.68 --> 690.779
the root cause of other problems that

688.32 --> 692.6400000000001
come out of it in this case expressed in

690.779 --> 694.26
my left shoulder

692.64 --> 696.24
so yeah

694.26 --> 699.3199999999999
I could have figured this out before but

696.24 --> 699.32
it took a while

700.38 --> 706.3389999999999
all right my dad anyway I had a really

702.899 --> 709.68
good dinner and all that the pizza

706.339 --> 712.7600000000001
that was really nice to have that again

709.68 --> 712.76
the new oven

713.22 --> 716.0600000000001
uh

719.88 --> 725.66
try some yoga in the morning

722.94 --> 725.6600000000001
no

726.959 --> 731.88
no seriously I stretch all the I I don't

730.139 --> 735.12
know if you noticed but I stretched like

731.88 --> 737.1
all the time even during the shows I

735.12 --> 740.519
just

737.1 --> 743.5790000000001
I'd just let that happen

740.519 --> 745.62
I don't feel any objection to just doing

743.579 --> 748.079
that

745.62 --> 748.46
to me it is kind of like fine-tuning

748.079 --> 750.12
myself

748.46 --> 752.519
[Music]

750.12 --> 755.82
and that's why I do it as a reflex when

752.519 --> 758.579
I'm talking like if I'm not talking

755.82 --> 760.9200000000001
then I'll just be kind of passive but

758.579 --> 763.26
then when I start talking that's when

760.92 --> 765.959
kind of

763.26 --> 768.899
the need for the stretching starts to

765.959 --> 772.079
present itself in impulses in my body

768.899 --> 774.2
and that's why I stretch so much during

772.079 --> 778.1389999999999
the show

774.2 --> 780.4200000000001
I've never really had some kind of yoga

778.139 --> 782.839
like discipline to do that in a moment

780.42 --> 782.8389999999999
of the day

786.18 --> 789.92
I just do it automatically

792.42 --> 796.8
hmm

793.74 --> 800.04
hello Terror 306 right away early start

796.8 --> 803.04
I don't know it's not that early

800.04 --> 805.5
it's just the normal time 2 pm Amsterdam

803.04 --> 809.04
time in the week in the weekends so

805.5 --> 811.22
right Rob H also here

809.04 --> 811.2199999999999
thank you

812.94 --> 815.72
hmm

827.04 --> 831.98
don't do me you were stretching goodie

835.8 --> 841.8199999999999
I'm good don't worry about that

839.98 --> 845.279
[Music]

841.82 --> 847.88
and yeah I am very proficient at

845.279 --> 847.88
massaging

848.1 --> 852.36
like I can do that with other people too

850.44 --> 854.399
very effectively

852.36 --> 856.62
and I'm good enough that I can literally

854.399 --> 860.339
do it to myself without causing some

856.62 --> 863.339
kind of feedback loop which can happen

860.339 --> 865.98
you know it's pretty difficult

863.339 --> 869.399
I think for some people

865.98 --> 871.32
to like use one like tighten up one part

869.399 --> 875.82
of their body

871.32 --> 878.4590000000001
without the other side just mirroring it

875.82 --> 881.24
and yeah if you're gonna massage one

878.459 --> 881.2399999999999
side of your body

881.519 --> 886.019
you can't have it tightened up because

884.22 --> 888.0
then it just doesn't work you have to

886.019 --> 890.9590000000001
like fully

888.0 --> 893.82
just split it off inside of your

890.959 --> 896.16
composure management and really relax

893.82 --> 899.1600000000001
one side as you use the other side

896.16 --> 902.42
tighten to do that and I can do that

899.16 --> 902.42
body control

904.86 --> 910.019
so yeah I will be all right I basically

907.56 --> 913.9799999999999
yeah as I said

910.019 --> 916.5
a few minutes ago I figured out like how

913.98 --> 918.36
how the situation really is set up in my

916.5 --> 920.88
body why I have issues with my left

918.36 --> 923.04
shoulder I know it is now on the other

920.88 --> 925.68
side I can yeah I'm going to be doing

923.04 --> 927.18
things about that

925.68 --> 929.579
all the time

927.18 --> 931.62
in the next few days and I I really do

929.579 --> 933.7199999999999
expect it to just all

931.62 --> 936.6
calm down and

933.72 --> 939.5400000000001
yeah get out of my system

936.6 --> 942.5
like today it already feels a lot better

939.54 --> 942.5
than it did yesterday

944.759 --> 950.639
all right and also by the way I don't

947.699 --> 952.74
know if there's a direct causation link

950.639 --> 956.839
with correlation like as soon as I did

952.74 --> 956.839
figure out I feel like

957.0 --> 961.259
what I said yesterday and I watched this

959.519 --> 962.88
back by the way I watched my show from

961.259 --> 965.88
yesterday back

962.88 --> 968.639
but when I said like I just I can't

965.88 --> 970.68
unburden anymore I can't let it go

968.639 --> 973.259
like I feel like I'm caught up in it and

970.68 --> 974.699
I can't let it go that seemed to have

973.259 --> 977.6990000000001
changed

974.699 --> 978.899
so I feel a lot a lot less burdened

977.699 --> 981.4799999999999
right now

978.899 --> 983.22
and I think it might be because I

981.48 --> 985.139
figured out basically where the the

983.22 --> 987.4200000000001
route was because yeah if you have an

985.139 --> 989.4590000000001
issue somewhere whatever type of issue

987.42 --> 991.4399999999999
whether it's purely mental or physical

989.459 --> 994.079
or anything

991.44 --> 997.3800000000001
if you literally can't pinpoint the real

994.079 --> 999.4799999999999
cause of it the root of it

997.38 --> 1002.54
you're gonna be just

999.48 --> 1005.6
like sitting under its weight not really

1002.54 --> 1008.54
having any perspective on how to stop it

1005.6 --> 1011.0
trying to ride it out and yeah that

1008.54 --> 1012.68
could take very long time as long as you

1011.0 --> 1016.18
don't know the root cause

1012.68 --> 1016.18
energy wise in the body

1016.399 --> 1021.019
hello Samson by the way good to see you

1019.699 --> 1024.519
good morning

1021.019 --> 1024.519
I miss my tea

1032.24 --> 1037.88
so yeah a correlation

1035.299 --> 1040.22
think I figured it out and I feel just a

1037.88 --> 1043.0390000000002
little less burdened

1040.22 --> 1046.28
from situations out there because I felt

1043.039 --> 1048.14
it pretty bad yesterday

1046.28 --> 1050.539
and the day before

1048.14 --> 1053.24
so yeah doing a little better

1050.539 --> 1055.94
despite You know despite it being very

1053.24 --> 1058.039
windy it it should be really restless

1055.94 --> 1060.64
but I'm not

1058.039 --> 1060.64
so

1074.72 --> 1076.9
foreign

1083.32 --> 1087.74
so anyway doing good

1086.24 --> 1090.98
got some

1087.74 --> 1094.6
Clarity some room in my head hopefully

1090.98 --> 1094.6
more tomorrow that will be even better

1094.78 --> 1100.28
also yeah my roommate that took the

1098.419 --> 1102.0800000000002
freaking vaccine

1100.28 --> 1104.12
seems like

1102.08 --> 1106.34
he's doing fine

1104.12 --> 1108.799
so yeah he did have some kind of a

1106.34 --> 1111.6789999999999
reaction he felt it in his arm he felt

1108.799 --> 1113.539
weak but that seems to be kind of over I

1111.679 --> 1115.52
don't know if there's any long-term

1113.539 --> 1118.9
issues

1115.52 --> 1118.9
there might just be

1120.02 --> 1124.82
but at least he's not giving signs like

1123.2 --> 1126.799
his body's not giving signs like he

1124.82 --> 1129.1399999999999
could collapse any second

1126.799 --> 1132.6399999999999
so that that calmed me down a little as

1129.14 --> 1132.64
well because I was really worried

1136.76 --> 1140.26
but yeah it's not over yet

1140.78 --> 1148.539
don't know exactly what is gonna happen

1144.08 --> 1148.539
you know experimental gene therapy

1156.98 --> 1162.64
so how are you guys doing how was your

1160.34 --> 1162.6399999999999
Saturday

1184.34 --> 1190.76
you all not being very talkative today

1189.08 --> 1194.059
it's fine

1190.76 --> 1197.62
sometimes I am not very talkative either

1194.059 --> 1197.62
even though it's my live show

1201.76 --> 1206.559

kind of me and the roommate before this

1234.679 --> 1240.5590000000002
yeah before the vaccine I heard about

1236.96 --> 1244.1000000000001
that but we kind of had a a food

1240.559 --> 1248.86

been like ages since I made that ages

1270.62 --> 1276.6999999999998
like at least at least a year probably

1274.22 --> 1276.7
more

1277.46 --> 1282.8600000000001
so I'm looking forward to that

1279.86 --> 1282.86
hmm

1283.46 --> 1286.3600000000001

okay

1349.18 --> 1353.72
[Music]

1354.799 --> 1360.74
yeah anybody else took note of like that

1358.28 --> 1363.559
apparently there's a Suez Canal traffic

1360.74 --> 1366.38
jam going on

1363.559 --> 1370.24
because of some ship

1366.38 --> 1370.24
that crashed or something

1393.4 --> 1397.24
Evergreen what

1409.88 --> 1418.3290000000002
[Music]

1422.9 --> 1425.74
hmm

1446.12 --> 1449.12
right

1451.159 --> 1457.94
that's the name of the ship oh

1454.58 --> 1460.46
I didn't know that huh okay

1457.94 --> 1463.52
right could be

1460.46 --> 1465.559
it's just I didn't really dig into it

1463.52 --> 1467.6589999999999
it's just something that stood out while

1465.559 --> 1471.3999999999999
browsing around that apparently that's

1467.659 --> 1471.4
causing all kinds of hassle

1473.88 --> 1478.929
[Music]

1482.96 --> 1487.53
yeah it's a pretty damn big ship I saw

1485.419 --> 1493.22
photos of it

1487.53 --> 1495.98
[Music]

1493.22 --> 1499.24
right anyway

1495.98 --> 1499.24
that's going on

1499.52 --> 1503.72
what this interesting article over in my

1501.919 --> 1506.0590000000002
Dutch news sources

1503.72 --> 1509.559
alternative

1506.059 --> 1509.559
that like

1510.559 --> 1516.32
like the main organization currently in

1513.44 --> 1518.8400000000001
the Netherlands that is kind of

1516.32 --> 1522.32
dealing with the corona situation is

1518.84 --> 1525.6999999999998
keeping its models a secret

1522.32 --> 1530.779
like even after official information

1525.7 --> 1532.82
inquiry processes which are like yeah

1530.779 --> 1535.64
that that is something that's really

1532.82 --> 1540.86
serious that's a serious government

1535.64 --> 1542.96
procedure that's all about just openness

1540.86 --> 1545.84
I've heard of this concept before like

1542.96 --> 1549.14
like 10 years ago I knew a couple of

1545.84 --> 1551.0
people and I went to meetings back then

1549.14 --> 1552.98
that we're doing this sort of thing all

1551.0 --> 1555.44
the time like in certain types of

1552.98 --> 1557.3600000000001
inquiry of information about like how

1555.44 --> 1559.3400000000001
are you how did you come to these

1557.36 --> 1562.58
conclusions in this case like what are

1559.34 --> 1566.48
your models for the corona situation

1562.58 --> 1568.76
and they're just not disclosing it

1566.48 --> 1571.46
this organization

1568.76 --> 1573.559
just highly dubious like they're not

1571.46 --> 1575.24
they're not supposed to be allowed to do

1573.559 --> 1578.299
that

1575.24 --> 1581.6
so that's coming afloat just going to

1578.299 --> 1585.02
show like yeah there is I it's it's to

1581.6 --> 1587.1789999999999
me it's funny that I see this message

1585.02 --> 1589.46
because I already had this feeling and I

1587.179 --> 1591.38
went on to this feeling telling people

1589.46 --> 1594.44
kind of between tongue and cheek like

1591.38 --> 1597.0200000000002
every time I hear that organization name

1594.44 --> 1599.659
our IVM like that's a criminal

1597.02 --> 1601.82
organization

1599.659 --> 1604.46
that's me as an oracle saying things

1601.82 --> 1606.74
like even before I understand it because

1604.46 --> 1607.94
I know it was gonna it's going to be

1606.74 --> 1610.58
true

1607.94 --> 1612.5
and this article basically just gave the

1610.58 --> 1614.299
first step of confirmation to that like

1612.5 --> 1616.82
they're really

1614.299 --> 1621.26
like this is one of the cornerstones

1616.82 --> 1623.4189999999999
that's upholding this Corona lockdown

1621.26 --> 1626.0
[ __ ]

1623.419 --> 1628.76
and they're not even being open about

1626.0 --> 1631.48
what models they use to make their

1628.76 --> 1631.48
decisions on

1641.899 --> 1647.4799999999998
very very telling

1644.84 --> 1650.1789999999999
I wonder how long it will take before

1647.48 --> 1652.52
yeah that completely seeps through to

1650.179 --> 1654.799
everything because yeah the groups that

1652.52 --> 1656.059
are keeping this in place here in the

1654.799 --> 1658.94
Netherlands

1656.059 --> 1663.22
they need to be identified and yeah

1658.94 --> 1663.22
properly responded to

1663.32 --> 1668.36
and I get the feeling that that is

1665.659 --> 1670.46
indeed happening it might be slow but it

1668.36 --> 1672.4399999999998
is happening like there yeah there's

1670.46 --> 1673.46
people really dedicated doing their best

1672.44 --> 1676.88
to

1673.46 --> 1680.6200000000001
get this thing sorted

1676.88 --> 1680.6200000000001
it's a kind of a relief

1683.36 --> 1688.779
though it's not over yet of course this

1685.58 --> 1688.779
thing is going to take a while

1691.52 --> 1699.559
[Music]

1700.76 --> 1705.86
but yeah again it's kind of funny to me

1703.159 --> 1710.48
how it works

1705.86 --> 1713.4189999999999
that like I do Oracle stuff all the time

1710.48 --> 1716.1200000000001
like all the time it's just like

1713.419 --> 1718.64
I got these strange doors available to

1716.12 --> 1722.36
me where I can literally like in a very

1718.64 --> 1725.24
early situation just say things that I

1722.36 --> 1727.399
know are going to happen and it just

1725.24 --> 1730.52
like suddenly I just opened this door in

1727.399 --> 1734.0
a whole another time frame

1730.52 --> 1735.9189999999999
and they figure those things out

1734.0 --> 1738.5
even though I don't have the full

1735.919 --> 1741.3400000000001
information I just I just go with my

1738.5 --> 1741.34
feeling and I know

1744.62 --> 1751.1
and it's always

1747.32 --> 1753.5
good when then time kind of catches up

1751.1 --> 1754.8799999999999
on that door that had been opened like

1753.5 --> 1757.88
that

1754.88 --> 1759.8600000000001
that I figure out yes I did call it I

1757.88 --> 1762.5800000000002
did see it coming I literally saw it

1759.86 --> 1762.58
coming it's coming

1765.86 --> 1769.4189999999999
oh hello Mark smilier

1781.64 --> 1784.3600000000001
ah

1785.33 --> 1789.099
[Music]

1790.64 --> 1796.1000000000001
entire

1793.039 --> 1799.52
everything for you if

1796.1 --> 1800.779
it will also type everything for you as

1799.52 --> 1804.02
well

1800.779 --> 1806.86
did you know that yes I know that yes of

1804.02 --> 1806.86
course I know that

1807.62 --> 1814.039
what you think I'm keeping a secret

1811.1 --> 1816.26
you think look I've been saying this for

1814.039 --> 1819.5
years okay

1816.26 --> 1821.36
I know like you can't keep secrets

1819.5 --> 1822.86
like it's going to be known by those

1821.36 --> 1827.08
that have

1822.86 --> 1827.08
ability to to find you

1830.539 --> 1834.62
if you're going to be active on the

1832.76 --> 1838.46
internet and you think you're doing

1834.62 --> 1842.2399999999998
things Anonymous you're an idiot

1838.46 --> 1844.039
like that boat has sailed

1842.24 --> 1846.6200000000001
doesn't really matter what technology

1844.039 --> 1850.039
you think you're using

1846.62 --> 1851.6589999999999
the identification it will become

1850.039 --> 1856.1589999999999
apparent

1851.659 --> 1859.3600000000001
like and if they yeah even if you manage

1856.159 --> 1861.919
to get your IPL concealed and all that

1859.36 --> 1864.6789999999999
it'll just freaking reconstruct it

1861.919 --> 1868.22
through your actual activities

1864.679 --> 1870.44
they will just know who you are by the

1868.22 --> 1871.64
frequency of your activities and how you

1870.44 --> 1874.299
do it

1871.64 --> 1874.2990000000002
everything

1874.46 --> 1879.74
just because you don't have an oversight

1877.34 --> 1881.799
to how you functions and how you do

1879.74 --> 1885.5
things doesn't mean that there aren't

1881.799 --> 1889.1
systems built to analyze and perfect

1885.5 --> 1890.6
ly figure out who you are buy your

1889.1 --> 1893.12
activities out there

1890.6 --> 1895.6399999999999
now I got a bit of an intuitive feel for

1893.12 --> 1898.58
doing that myself but there are systems

1895.64 --> 1902.0590000000002
out there algorithmic analysis systems

1898.58 --> 1905.779
that are just so good at it

1902.059 --> 1910.48
it's barely believable but it works so

1905.779 --> 1910.48
yeah there's no secrets absolutely none

1916.519 --> 1920.96
you don't get it Google translate will

1918.559 --> 1926.08
read whatever

1920.96 --> 1926.08
what yet so what Mark Smiler

1927.919 --> 1934.24
yeah you can get it to

1930.019 --> 1934.24
read out things sure you can

1941.059 --> 1945.1589999999999
what's your point you got a point

1985.36 --> 1990.279
what are you blabbering about Mark swile

1988.1 --> 1990.279
here

1990.799 --> 1997.24
I'm not going to call up things and do

1993.98 --> 1997.24
your little processes

2000.46 --> 2004.5
I'm doing my show that's what I'm doing

2011.5 --> 2016.48
all right then I'm not gonna help you

2013.84 --> 2019.12
create some freaking arwin-based

2016.48 --> 2021.94
speaking engine or whatever right I'm

2019.12 --> 2023.86
not gonna read out certain sentences in

2021.94 --> 2026.88
a certain recording thanks very much

2023.86 --> 2026.8799999999999
Mark Smiler

2042.88 --> 2046.659
I'm like what what the hell does this

2045.039 --> 2049.48
have to do with

2046.659 --> 2053.2000000000003
implants

2049.48 --> 2057.3
into the jab like how do you know

2053.2 --> 2057.2999999999997
did you get to analyze any of it

2058.3 --> 2062.9190000000003
I mean like if there's supposed to be an

2060.46 --> 2069.159
implant right well what's stopping you

2062.919 --> 2072.04
from just getting a a vaccine anywhere

2069.159 --> 2074.379
just despair

2072.04 --> 2076.72
and then putting that [ __ ] under a

2074.379 --> 2078.399
microscope meticulously so where is the

2076.72 --> 2081.24
implant

2078.399 --> 2081.24
where is it

2083.31 --> 2086.489
[Music]

2087.099 --> 2094.7200000000003
if there is implant material you should

2090.099 --> 2097.26
be able to just get it out of the unused

2094.72 --> 2097.2599999999998
vaccine

2104.079 --> 2108.88
yeah well Mark Smiley you're not exactly

2106.359 --> 2109.5989999999997
helping you're throwing in certain types

2108.88 --> 2112.1800000000003
of

2109.599 --> 2114.4
suggestions whatever

2112.18 --> 2116.98
I can barely even figure out the

2114.4 --> 2119.2000000000003
correlation between them so yeah you're

2116.98 --> 2122.859
not making a lot of sense right now and

2119.2 --> 2126.839
especially not getting to the point

2122.859 --> 2126.839
like what is your freaking point

2173.93 --> 2179.9199999999996
[Music]

2175.96 --> 2182.16
I hate to read oh no I don't hate to

2179.92 --> 2182.16
read

2183.579 --> 2189.2200000000003
I will hate to listen to some kind of

2186.4 --> 2192.7200000000003
automated reading program much more than

2189.22 --> 2192.72
I would hate to read thanks

2205.55 --> 2208.7290000000003
[Music]

2212.68 --> 2216.54
Mark get a point

2233.68 --> 2241.859
a clutch bear good to see you Chad

2237.82 --> 2245.579
yeah I'm doing good I'm doing better

2241.859 --> 2245.5789999999997
rested more focused

2245.74 --> 2251.859
figured out how to resolve the situation

2249.88 --> 2255.7000000000003
with my shoulder which is kind of been

2251.859 --> 2258.7
my main burden some physical response

2255.7 --> 2262.0
I do a lot of things

2258.7 --> 2265.859
so I'm restoring

2262.0 --> 2265.859
hey Chris lechambe

2267.46 --> 2272.76
Mark smylier get a freaking Point man

2273.52 --> 2276.359
get a point

2281.44 --> 2285.88
so if there's if there is an implant

2283.9 --> 2289.7200000000003
which you're literally putting in the

2285.88 --> 2290.98
same sentence every time with the gab I

2289.72 --> 2294.06
don't know even why I have to say it

2290.98 --> 2294.06
like that's ridiculous

2295.06 --> 2303.46
so where is the substance in there

2299.32 --> 2305.02
put it under a microscope and point at

2303.46 --> 2307.5
the implant

2305.02 --> 2307.5
right

2315.46 --> 2320.32
stretch in the shower and sleep flat on

2317.92 --> 2322.7400000000002
your bed I just I always sleep flat on

2320.32 --> 2322.7400000000002
my back

2322.839 --> 2329.2599999999998
like I'm extremely like extremely

2326.579 --> 2332.2200000000003
fanatically careful with my back I've

2329.26 --> 2332.2200000000003
been for a long time

2332.26 --> 2338.1400000000003
it's not gonna grow worse because of my

2335.26 --> 2340.6800000000003
bodily personal negligence that's never

2338.14 --> 2340.68
gonna happen

2341.619 --> 2345.06
but thanks for your concern

2349.0 --> 2354.18
it's already getting better I'm working

2351.76 --> 2354.1800000000003
on it

2375.52 --> 2381.339
so yeah

2378.28 --> 2383.2000000000003
since Mark doesn't really seem to have a

2381.339 --> 2385.72
coherent point at this time let me give

2383.2 --> 2387.52
you an alternative idea

2385.72 --> 2390.8799999999997
how about

2387.52 --> 2395.099
they're just pumping [ __ ] into people

2390.88 --> 2399.6400000000003
potentially causing mentally disruptive

2395.099 --> 2403.079
processes like confusion whatever and

2399.64 --> 2408.2799999999997
then the there is an average working

2403.079 --> 2410.1400000000003
of all that and maybe there testing

2408.28 --> 2414.88
the void

2410.14 --> 2416.68
like people's natural habit to when they

2414.88 --> 2419.1400000000003
certainly lose ability to handle

2416.68 --> 2421.0
something in their system because well

2419.14 --> 2423.0989999999997
in this case because of like the direct

2421.0 --> 2424.78
consequences of taking that stuff and

2423.099 --> 2426.76
getting poisoned

2424.78 --> 2429.099
that they're testing the railroad

2426.76 --> 2432.2200000000003
mechanism like

2429.099 --> 2434.6800000000003
literally more people will

2432.22 --> 2438.04
kind of just start doing that because

2434.68 --> 2440.2599999999998
they have been kind of defeated in the

2438.04 --> 2442.24
moment spiritually they don't even know

2440.26 --> 2444.4
it so they're just gonna follow some

2442.24 --> 2446.4399999999996
pattern like oh what is the safe thing

2444.4 --> 2450.96
to do next without

2446.44 --> 2450.96
a lot of sensibility to it

2451.0 --> 2456.28
so maybe they're testing the results

2454.599 --> 2459.76
afterward

2456.28 --> 2463.1800000000003
within communication within their own

2459.76 --> 2467.38
groups of people and they're blabbering

2463.18 --> 2469.839
and people's egos with their ideas of

2467.38 --> 2472.48
their own form of indoctrination that

2469.839 --> 2474.339
they subject people to

2472.48 --> 2477.4
because there's very little resistance

2474.339 --> 2480.34
to any of that in a lot of groups

2477.4 --> 2483.53
people and their Communications

2480.34 --> 2483.53
[Music]

2486.72 --> 2492.22
[Music]

2489.16 --> 2494.98
well Mark smileer instead of just

2492.22 --> 2497.6189999999997
constantly literally inserting that

2494.98 --> 2499.48
conspiracy theory which I'm gonna call

2497.619 --> 2502.42
it now because you haven't actually

2499.48 --> 2505.119
offered any evidence or addressed

2502.42 --> 2510.119
my questions concerning that

2505.119 --> 2510.119
to inquire some proof for it right

2511.54 --> 2516.7
so either you get to that

2514.3 --> 2519.8390000000004
or I'm gonna ignore you

2516.7 --> 2519.839
because you're annoying

2522.44 --> 2526.26
[Music]

2532.29 --> 2536.68
[Music]

2534.28 --> 2540.099
yeah because I I know what you mean with

2536.68 --> 2543.339
implants yeah it has existed that exists

2540.099 --> 2547.2400000000002
yeah if it's in there prove it's in

2543.339 --> 2550.119
there stop blabbering endlessly on with

2547.24 --> 2553.24
your models assuming it and why don't

2550.119 --> 2556.0
you [ __ ] prove it for once man

2553.24 --> 2557.9799999999996
prove it I just gave you

2556.0 --> 2562.18
an opportunity

2557.98 --> 2564.3
an idea in how to do it you get one of

2562.18 --> 2565.72
the [ __ ] vaccines

2564.3 --> 2569.26
[Music]

2565.72 --> 2574.319
and then you study its content under a

2569.26 --> 2574.3190000000004
microscope and find the implant

2575.56 --> 2579.2799999999997
that's what you're talking about you're

2577.42 --> 2581.859
talking about implants and you're just

2579.28 --> 2583.9
assuming oh yeah so it's implant so it's

2581.859 --> 2586.42
going to be a communication network with

2583.9 --> 2587.38
the so where is the [ __ ] implant then

2586.42 --> 2589.48
man

2587.38 --> 2591.1600000000003
the vaccines are right there this is not

2589.48 --> 2593.98
like something that happened 80 years

2591.16 --> 2596.02
ago so you can't find any right you have

2593.98 --> 2598.119
to dig it out of people

2596.02 --> 2600.64
because it's in there right

2598.119 --> 2604.5
if it's this stuff is being handed out

2600.64 --> 2604.5
right now where are they

2604.54 --> 2609.16
where are they where's the proof of the

2607.18 --> 2612.64
implant right because I'm not denying

2609.16 --> 2615.8799999999997
that they've been used at some point

2612.64 --> 2618.46
it's just that saying it's being used

2615.88 --> 2620.44
right now well

2618.46 --> 2623.5
where is it then

2620.44 --> 2626.619
put it under a microscope show it to me

2623.5 --> 2630.04
instead of just trying to

2626.619 --> 2632.44
enroll me into just assuming they're

2630.04 --> 2635.8
there yeah I'm not going to be

2632.44 --> 2638.319
indoctrinated by your Conspiracy Theory

2635.8 --> 2641.1400000000003
without you actually providing some

2638.319 --> 2643.92
evidence for that

2641.14 --> 2643.92
how about that

2647.619 --> 2652.619
oh what you sent some ethereum really

2653.859 --> 2658.359
cool

2655.96 --> 2663.48
oh I'll check it out

2658.359 --> 2663.48
the like does that is it already arrived

2664.24 --> 2668.74
or does that take some time cool thanks

2667.24 --> 2671.16
I'll check it out

2668.74 --> 2671.16
let's see

2673.18 --> 2677.16
yeah I do have something cool

2678.22 --> 2681.5789999999997
thanks man

2679.63 --> 2684.06
[Music]

2681.579 --> 2684.0600000000004
I got

2685.92 --> 2691.78
0.009399 ethereum thanks very much I

2689.56 --> 2695.2
really appreciate that that's the first

2691.78 --> 2697.1800000000003
bit of ethereum I've got

2695.2 --> 2699.04
cool thanks

2697.18 --> 2701.2
just gonna sit there and see what it

2699.04 --> 2703.599
does for a while you know I'm mostly

2701.2 --> 2706.7999999999997
just saving my stuff

2703.599 --> 2706.8
my my crypto

2737.98 --> 2743.7400000000002
cool well Mark smylier that's really

2741.9 --> 2746.02
fascinating

2743.74 --> 2749.2599999999998
hey and hey

2746.02 --> 2751.78
let's just presuppose you right now of

2749.26 --> 2754.0
course Without Really the real evidence

2751.78 --> 2756.579
by showing the the substance under a

2754.0 --> 2758.68
microscope and show oh look there is the

2756.579 --> 2762.3590000000004
implant it's a physical thing it's a

2758.68 --> 2765.22
crystal it's whatever it's a distinct

2762.359 --> 2767.38
non-liquid thing right

2765.22 --> 2769.06
without that yeah let's just assume

2767.38 --> 2771.6400000000003
you're right okay that's interesting so

2769.06 --> 2773.74
if somebody takes one of these garbage

2771.64 --> 2777.94
vaccines that aren't actually vaccines

2773.74 --> 2777.9399999999996
with just medical experimentation

2778.18 --> 2783.2799999999997
and there would be an implant yeah

2781.0 --> 2784.24
right where they shirt you with that

2783.28 --> 2787.92
[ __ ]

2784.24 --> 2787.9199999999996
get a super strong magnet

2788.14 --> 2794.56
like as long as it's just within tissue

2791.68 --> 2796.9199999999996
that's not going to be devastating as it

2794.56 --> 2799.9
were if there was some kind of physical

2796.92 --> 2801.819
damage then yeah just freaking pull it

2799.9 --> 2806.319
out with a magnet

2801.819 --> 2808.48
if that's really as you say measurable

2806.319 --> 2811.54
with people

2808.48 --> 2813.7
yeah if you're warning if you're the

2811.54 --> 2816.2799999999997
morning

2813.7 --> 2818.319
if you're worried about it yeah get a

2816.28 --> 2820.48
very strong magnet and just keep it over

2818.319 --> 2822.7
the vaccination spot

2820.48 --> 2824.98
and who knows maybe it's strong enough

2822.7 --> 2827.56
you could literally just like a splinter

2824.98 --> 2829.9
pull it through the muscle tissue out

2827.56 --> 2831.22
maybe into your skin or something I

2829.9 --> 2834.4
don't know

2831.22 --> 2838.7799999999997
this bit far-fetched Maybe

2834.4 --> 2841.119
but hey if you're assuming that a magnet

2838.78 --> 2844.1800000000003
will literally pull some kind of element

2841.119 --> 2846.04
having direct influence then you might

2844.18 --> 2848.68
just as well use that to your advantage

2846.04 --> 2849.7599999999998
and prevent this presupposed implant

2848.68 --> 2852.22
thing

2849.76 --> 2854.559
from creeping to places where it's going

2852.22 --> 2856.66
to be much harder to extract right and

2854.559 --> 2858.7000000000003
I'm presupposing a lot with this

2856.66 --> 2862.0
because you haven't actually provided

2858.7 --> 2864.339
any physical evidence for this being the

2862.0 --> 2868.619
case right now because I'm not denying

2864.339 --> 2868.619
that it has happened Dr Hammer study

2868.68 --> 2874.839
and I have

2872.079 --> 2877.3590000000004
like dissecting of dead people has

2874.839 --> 2880.0589999999997
definitely yielded

2877.359 --> 2884.02
results that showed that implants have

2880.059 --> 2886.119
been used right that's

2884.02 --> 2890.2
not guaranteed

2886.119 --> 2893.38
in this case so yeah new things you have

2890.2 --> 2896.5
to figure it out is it really in there

2893.38 --> 2897.76
get one of those supposed vaccines don't

2896.5 --> 2900.94
inject it

2897.76 --> 2904.3590000000004
get it yeah make sure

2900.94 --> 2906.94
can't get contaminated

2904.359 --> 2908.38
and study that [ __ ] under microscope so

2906.94 --> 2911.619
where's the implant

2908.38 --> 2913.599
right and I'm sick of continually asking

2911.619 --> 2915.88
you this you should be freaking doing

2913.599 --> 2917.8
this right you're concerned about these

2915.88 --> 2919.599
implants so you freaking prove it's

2917.8 --> 2922.6600000000003
there

2919.599 --> 2925.7200000000003
don't just keep echoing the same [ __ ]

2922.66 --> 2929.0789999999997
over and over making people presuppose

2925.72 --> 2930.48
it's there proof it's there then

2929.079 --> 2932.02
mark

2930.48 --> 2935.22
Smiler

2932.02 --> 2937.72
stop making people presuppose

2935.22 --> 2941.2799999999997
subconsciously it's there and prove it's

2937.72 --> 2941.2799999999997
there how about that

2963.7 --> 2967.5989999999997
would you like the evidence which well

2965.68 --> 2971.2
you're here in chat aren't you

2967.599 --> 2974.92
so provided don't ask me

2971.2 --> 2977.64
I'm not going to engage with you mark

2974.92 --> 2977.64
smylier

2980.619 --> 2987.52
if you're going to talk about something

2983.14 --> 2991.5
being there right now right now in this

2987.52 --> 2994.96
current product freaking prove it stop

2991.5 --> 2999.54
blabbering on your presuppositional

2994.96 --> 2999.54
based conspiracy theories all right

3014.94 --> 3020.46
which is under strong guard

3017.94 --> 3023.339
oh what you're saying you're not allowed

3020.46 --> 3025.44
to take those vaccinations with you you

3023.339 --> 3026.88
can only take them with you in your arm

3025.44 --> 3030.859
really

3026.88 --> 3030.859
that sounds completely nonsensical

3055.38 --> 3059.54
all right so yeah you're not helping

3067.6 --> 3072.56
[Music]

3079.559 --> 3084.119
right clutch bear

3081.359 --> 3087.14

3084.119 --> 3087.1400000000003
all the time

3087.78 --> 3092.46
that's why I'm not being yeah very nice

3090.48 --> 3094.94

3092.46 --> 3094.94
behavior

3101.04 --> 3106.319
oh yeah oh it makes no sense so why

3104.099 --> 3108.42
should we try to actually find some

3106.319 --> 3110.579
empirical evidence for the conspiracy

3108.42 --> 3112.98
theories that we're forwarding oh it's

3110.579 --> 3116.9
too difficult oh it's all much worse and

3112.98 --> 3116.9
where did dude shut the [ __ ] up

3117.9 --> 3120.079
foreign

3121.19 --> 3128.48
[Music]

3124.28 --> 3128.48
dude just go away

3128.88 --> 3134.46
I'm done with this

3130.859 --> 3137.24
you're spamming my chat

3134.46 --> 3137.2400000000002
done with it

3142.74 --> 3147.6189999999997
so anybody else have a better point

3150.24 --> 3155.819
I thought that I don't know my

3153.54 --> 3158.099
suggestion was really good

3155.819 --> 3160.5589999999997
should definitely be done I don't know

3158.099 --> 3164.6600000000003
maybe if you're just some goober like

3160.559 --> 3164.6600000000003
Mark zwylier you're too afraid

3165.24 --> 3170.16
and just gonna see paranoid stories

3167.78 --> 3171.9
which you don't actually have evidence

3170.16 --> 3173.8799999999997
even though you could potentially get

3171.9 --> 3177.96
that evidence

3173.88 --> 3180.059
or maybe there is doctors out there or

3177.96 --> 3182.3
like really alternative type doctors

3180.059 --> 3184.6800000000003
that are still just carefully

3182.3 --> 3188.6400000000003
maneuvering within the system knowing

3184.68 --> 3190.74
the the lawyer details you need to know

3188.64 --> 3194.64
maybe they could do it maybe they can

3190.74 --> 3196.4399999999996
just like okay we got a vaccine right

3194.64 --> 3199.0789999999997
take it with them

3196.44 --> 3202.319
get it under a microscope and just start

3199.079 --> 3204.78
seeing like hey what is it in this

3202.319 --> 3207.38
who's gonna stop it

3204.78 --> 3207.38
nobody

3208.44 --> 3214.68
so is there an implant in this like Mike

3211.8 --> 3217.1400000000003
smarlier is just taking for granted

3214.68 --> 3219.5989999999997
because of magnets and people felt

3217.14 --> 3221.46
magnet response and ooh that's very

3219.599 --> 3225.5
special

3221.46 --> 3225.5
so let's actually get some evidence

3229.68 --> 3234.4199999999996
right and who knows who's going to pick

3231.96 --> 3237.839
up on this maybe there will be doctors

3234.42 --> 3240.48
now that are getting this idea and gonna

3237.839 --> 3242.88
check it out I would be very interested

3240.48 --> 3244.8
to see

3242.88 --> 3247.44
you know

3244.8 --> 3250.559
what is in this [ __ ]

3247.44 --> 3251.4
like not even what is said to be in

3250.559 --> 3253.079
there

3251.4 --> 3255.7200000000003
but just like

3253.079 --> 3257.579
putting it under a microscope what is

3255.72 --> 3261.9199999999996
actually in there let's take a look

3257.579 --> 3261.92
right that where is it

3289.74 --> 3295.5589999999997
yeah Samson well look

3292.5 --> 3298.98
it it's it's just that it's annoying me

3295.559 --> 3300.7200000000003
like he's not really offended me he does

3298.98 --> 3303.42
that [ __ ] all the time makes leaves

3300.72 --> 3305.22
Behind these giant messages and then

3303.42 --> 3306.66
even gets insulted when I don't read

3305.22 --> 3311.04
them

3306.66 --> 3313.2599999999998
and he's very much fascinated with the

3311.04 --> 3315.0
implants with yeah in the past half

3313.26 --> 3317.6400000000003
happened

3315.0 --> 3320.94
I might have some

3317.64 --> 3323.52
can't I can't basically discount it I

3320.94 --> 3326.579
would have to consciously go through

3323.52 --> 3329.46
like a full body scan and then like be

3326.579 --> 3333.559
there not let some doctor whatever

3329.46 --> 3333.559
decide what I can see or not

3333.96 --> 3340.5
to know for sure

3336.24 --> 3343.2
but I might have some but that yeah that

3340.5 --> 3345.66
doesn't mean that you should just take

3343.2 --> 3348.0589999999997
for granted it's going to be in

3345.66 --> 3351.1189999999997
something that's rolling out right now

3348.059 --> 3354.059
you know if it's rolling out right now

3351.119 --> 3357.299
take the substance put it under a

3354.059 --> 3358.44
microscope and see if it is actually in

3357.299 --> 3361.319
there

3358.44 --> 3365.2400000000002
how hard can it be people

3361.319 --> 3365.24
this shouldn't be too difficult to do

3370.92 --> 3376.079
ah I mind warp yeah thanks I'm just

3374.4 --> 3378.619
doing my best to approach this

3376.079 --> 3378.619
rationally

3388.319 --> 3393.2
yeah welcome back hope you're doing all

3391.02 --> 3393.2
right

3409.92 --> 3416.46
go to Anthony patch

3412.68 --> 3419.22
or take on what's in there okay

3416.46 --> 3421.7400000000002
ready Matty grow

3419.22 --> 3423.48
never heard of him but is that

3421.74 --> 3426.0589999999997
Diddy also

3423.48 --> 3428.16
did he just basically go through the

3426.059 --> 3430.559
literature the background literature of

3428.16 --> 3433.6189999999997
it and that way I told you what's in

3430.559 --> 3435.6600000000003
there or did he actually

3433.619 --> 3438.42
take the substance put it under a

3435.66 --> 3440.2799999999997
microscope and study it

3438.42 --> 3442.559
it's a big difference you know because

3440.28 --> 3445.02
there is just a vast amount of

3442.559 --> 3448.28
literature out there medical literature

3445.02 --> 3448.28
about this garbage

3459.299 --> 3465.559
right well yeah we'll we'll build dude

3462.96 --> 3465.559
what the [ __ ]

3467.819 --> 3472.68
uh

3470.04 --> 3476.04
yeah sure I'm not saying it's not an

3472.68 --> 3476.7
ideal opportunity I'm just saying prove

3476.04 --> 3480.2599999999998
it

3476.7 --> 3483.18
yeah prove it

3480.26 --> 3484.7990000000004
prove it yeah super convenient oh you

3483.18 --> 3486.5589999999997
would do it oh yeah yeah it makes

3484.799 --> 3489.74
perfect yeah yeah

3486.559 --> 3489.7400000000002
prove it

3495.839 --> 3501.48
don't dis detach

3498.54 --> 3503.819
the Dream from reality yeah oh it would

3501.48 --> 3505.4
be perfect presuppositional setup it's a

3503.819 --> 3508.579
perfect

3505.4 --> 3508.579
prove it

3516.54 --> 3522.38
oh Sam's yeah exactly of course

3520.26 --> 3524.3390000000004
just by the known data it's already

3522.38 --> 3526.6800000000003
ridiculous if you're gonna take it

3524.339 --> 3529.14
absolutely ridiculous

3526.68 --> 3531.8999999999996
edit jeans for flu and it doesn't work

3529.14 --> 3533.8799999999997
it doesn't actually do that it doesn't

3531.9 --> 3537.42
like

3533.88 --> 3540.7200000000003
there's no effective editing

3537.42 --> 3543.359
going on that could actually help

3540.72 --> 3545.7
the flu

3543.359 --> 3547.38
that's the scariest part that even in

3545.7 --> 3549.72
the literature it's just showing like

3547.38 --> 3551.52
yeah we're just [ __ ] around like this

3549.72 --> 3552.7799999999997
process just [ __ ] around with this and

3551.52 --> 3557.099
that

3552.78 --> 3560.7000000000003
it doesn't say like and that is going to

3557.099 --> 3564.1800000000003
result in this process happening and

3560.7 --> 3567.4199999999996
that's going to stimulate that resulting

3564.18 --> 3570.54
in oh look less flu contamination better

3567.42 --> 3573.299
healing no no that's not even in there

3570.54 --> 3576.24
it just doesn't exist it's just like no

3573.299 --> 3578.22
just [ __ ] around

3576.24 --> 3582.4199999999996
and that's it

3578.22 --> 3585.48
there is no actual process described how

3582.42 --> 3588.359
any of it is going to lead to you having

3585.48 --> 3591.54
less flu symptoms or getting over the

3588.359 --> 3593.88
flu or anything in that direction it's

3591.54 --> 3595.799
just [ __ ] around with you

3593.88 --> 3598.26
genetically that's it

3595.799 --> 3600.359
ridiculous

3598.26 --> 3602.579
right so yeah of course don't take it

3600.359 --> 3604.5589999999997
but hey if you're going to spread

3602.579 --> 3606.299
conspiracy theories about how there is

3604.559 --> 3609.9
an implant like

3606.299 --> 3612.859
the old Nazi style implants or call them

3609.9 --> 3612.859
Nazi or whatever

3613.44 --> 3617.339
there's in there

3615.619 --> 3620.6400000000003
prove it

3617.339 --> 3623.7799999999997
the opportunity is right there

3620.64 --> 3627.1189999999997
you could prove it stop blabbering on

3623.78 --> 3630.2400000000002
and actually get the evidence it's right

3627.119 --> 3632.94
there these things

3630.24 --> 3636.359
are there uninjected

3632.94 --> 3639.42
for you to get one put it under a

3636.359 --> 3641.7
microscope and prove

3639.42 --> 3643.38
that there is actually this implant in

3641.7 --> 3646.16
there

3643.38 --> 3646.1600000000003
that's it

3647.819 --> 3652.38
what

3650.28 --> 3656.28
uh

3652.38 --> 3660.1800000000003
oh okay mind Warp I got a penis 1000 now

3656.28 --> 3662.48
that's nice give me a peanut what I

3660.18 --> 3665.819
already got one

3662.48 --> 3670.14
I appreciate that but

3665.819 --> 3674.42
I already got a p900 I got rantes and I

3670.14 --> 3674.42
I'm not really using it that much

3674.94 --> 3680.7200000000003
maybe one day I will

3677.88 --> 3680.7200000000003
right now

3681.18 --> 3687.8999999999996
it's not really working out I tried to

3683.88 --> 3690.599
film the moon the other day but it just

3687.9 --> 3692.28
I couldn't get the setup right I'm

3690.599 --> 3694.079
having some issues with just the

3692.28 --> 3696.6800000000003
interface too

3694.079 --> 3699.3590000000004
I'm I'm not a very

3696.68 --> 3702.0789999999997
technologically apt person

3699.359 --> 3702.0789999999997
like that

3706.74 --> 3712.5589999999997
one for each eye dude you know how heavy

3709.74 --> 3715.02
a p900 is I'm not gonna freaking wear a

3712.559 --> 3717.38
helmet with p900s on them it's way too

3715.02 --> 3717.38
heavy

3718.619 --> 3723.539
silly thought uh

3721.14 --> 3726.24
anyway yeah cool mine worked you got the

3723.539 --> 3729.48
p1000 nice

3726.24 --> 3731.3999999999996
it's really heavy right it's like three

3729.48 --> 3734.839
times as heavy or something

3731.4 --> 3734.839
those things are huge

3752.88 --> 3755.88
foreign

3759.74 --> 3764.1189999999997
how the hour has flown by

3764.819 --> 3768.02
already passed

3772.5 --> 3777.42
right so yeah thanks Mark smileer for

3775.5 --> 3780.299
inserting your conspiracy theories you

3777.42 --> 3782.76
did definitely kind of gave me a theme

3780.299 --> 3786.18
of the day to work with

3782.76 --> 3788.039
and I highlighted some things

3786.18 --> 3790.2599999999998
about it

3788.039 --> 3793.26
like hey

3790.26 --> 3795.3590000000004
yeah sure it could be you know you have

3793.26 --> 3797.1600000000003
an opportunity to actually provide some

3795.359 --> 3801.0
physical proof for it

3797.16 --> 3802.2599999999998
so you realize it's probably not gonna

3801.0 --> 3804.24
be in there and that's why you're not

3802.26 --> 3806.039
engaging or

3804.24 --> 3809.7599999999998
You're simply too

3806.039 --> 3812.2400000000002
stubborn or whatever or frightful trying

3809.76 --> 3812.2400000000002
it out

3812.339 --> 3817.14
you know

3813.42 --> 3820.44
like are you afraid to actually find out

3817.14 --> 3823.3799999999997
that it is really true like in your face

3820.44 --> 3826.14
because you tested it yourself Beyond

3823.38 --> 3828.98
magnets and people responding to them oh

3826.14 --> 3828.98
well that's special

3829.44 --> 3836.2200000000003
you know proving it's actually in it

3833.099 --> 3839.7000000000003
what an opportunity

3836.22 --> 3842.7
but yeah maybe you're just too nervous

3839.7 --> 3844.98
about it too fearful to actually get the

3842.7 --> 3848.96
physical confirmation for it that could

3844.98 --> 3848.96
be I wouldn't be surprised

3849.24 --> 3851.4799999999996
foreign

3873.24 --> 3876.24
anyway

3876.359 --> 3882.359
I think I'm gonna round it out so thanks

3879.839 --> 3883.859
everyone for coming I hope you liked

3882.359 --> 3886.0989999999997

3883.859 --> 3886.0989999999997
today

3886.14 --> 3889.74
it's an interesting bump in with Mark

3888.359 --> 3892.5589999999997
smileer

3889.74 --> 3894.66
kind of annoying but still yeah

3892.559 --> 3896.52
some food for thought

3894.66 --> 3899.24
and a good idea to get out of it

3896.52 --> 3899.24
potentially

3901.14 --> 3906.9
right so if you liked it then please
