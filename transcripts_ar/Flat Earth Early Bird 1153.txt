93.119 --> 98.88
earlier but right now yeah there's a

95.6 --> 98.88
cloud in front of it

99.6 --> 104.24
but yeah it's been really nice

102.88 --> 107.28
it's

104.24 --> 111.19999999999999
only very mild winds and

107.28 --> 111.2
nice clear blue spots

111.439 --> 116.079
and a couple of clouds but

115.119 --> 120.28
yeah

116.079 --> 120.27999999999999
it's overall very nice day

135.2 --> 139.44
right so yeah i wonder how many people

137.28 --> 143.36
actually tune in because

139.44 --> 146.0
for some very odd reason jaren

143.36 --> 148.31900000000002
from journalism is streaming live also

146.0 --> 150.319
has been for last

148.319 --> 152.879
hour or so

150.319 --> 155.35999999999999
maybe more i don't know when i came on

152.879 --> 159.28
my computer he was already streaming so

155.36 --> 159.28
he's having like this long night

159.68 --> 164.56
stream or something

162.239 --> 164.56
weird

165.68 --> 173.28
usually has a couple of snippets in the

168.84 --> 173.28
night but yeah this is new

175.2 --> 179.67999999999998
right so

177.12 --> 179.68
anyway

182.56 --> 188.36
it is friday the 11th of february 2022.

196.959 --> 202.0
right also yeah i did notice that i am

199.519 --> 204.0
blocked over at geranism i don't know

202.0 --> 206.72
how if he's

204.0 --> 208.319
behind that even

206.72 --> 211.28
like even with my sock account and

208.319 --> 213.51899999999998
that's really disappointing

211.28 --> 216.239
like i don't know why why

213.519 --> 216.239
why do that

217.84 --> 222.20000000000002
am i such a huge heckler

227.36 --> 230.4
i don't know what it is

232.08 --> 234.64000000000001
anyway

236.64 --> 242.0
hey jeff gas head

238.84 --> 244.959
huh had to switch to live chat because

242.0 --> 246.08
apparently top chat didn't show you

244.959 --> 248.48
weird

246.08 --> 249.84
anyway good to see you

[Music]

291.44 --> 296.4
flat earth debates yesterday was

293.52 --> 300.15999999999997

again so thank you very much

345.68 --> 350.40000000000003
like

347.6 --> 352.56

for the weekend so thank you very much

352.56 --> 356.88
for the support

354.639 --> 356.88
uh

361.039 --> 364.31899999999996
right yeah i'm i'm still kind of

362.56 --> 367.319
distracted by

364.319 --> 367.319
jaren

369.759 --> 377.68
he's reviewing like old uh

373.68 --> 379.84000000000003
70s space videos and all that

377.68 --> 382.0
and giving commentary

379.84 --> 384.31899999999996
it's it's very interesting well it's

382.0 --> 385.919
entertaining at least so

384.319 --> 387.12
it's kind of hard to break away from

385.919 --> 388.08
that

387.12 --> 391.72
but yeah

388.08 --> 391.71999999999997
i gotta do a show

402.479 --> 408.68
hey stop traffic i'm arrested

405.12 --> 408.68
how are you doing

418.56 --> 423.12
yeah someone saw some of my typical

421.039 --> 427.36
followers here

423.12 --> 427.36
this show i saw them in jaren's chat too

434.4 --> 438.08
roon thorson is hanging around there a

436.72 --> 440.16
lot

438.08 --> 441.84
hasn't really shown up by here in a long

440.16 --> 443.84000000000003
time

441.84 --> 445.039
i have no idea why he has a wrench there

443.84 --> 448.19899999999996
by the way

445.039 --> 448.199
all right

471.28 --> 474.96
right so yeah now i feel a little

476.84 --> 481.919
awkward because jared's just going and

479.759 --> 483.84000000000003
going and going

481.919 --> 486.4
doing what he does

483.84 --> 489.19899999999996
and yeah i i i

486.4 --> 490.56
really like that

489.199 --> 492.96000000000004
although it's not really fair because

490.56 --> 495.36
he's had an entire night i really don't

492.96 --> 497.599
know why he's up until

495.36 --> 499.68
must be like five in the morning or six

497.599 --> 502.15999999999997
in the morning now what time is it there

499.68 --> 502.16
resta

504.72 --> 511.12
banned by bob yeah i think it's bob then

507.919 --> 515.399
i think he banned me too got me ben

511.12 --> 515.399
i just don't understand why

520.8 --> 524.0
like

521.519 --> 526.64
well i understand why bob does it but i

524.0 --> 529.44
don't understand why jaren just lets it

526.64 --> 529.4399999999999
the way it is

530.64 --> 534.519
that part i don't understand

537.36 --> 541.519
all right yeah he's uh he's ending his

539.519 --> 542.9590000000001
show

541.519 --> 544.32
if you believe in a creator then you

542.959 --> 548.8389999999999
have to believe that we're here for some

544.32 --> 548.839
reason this has to be some all right

554.48 --> 561.64
4am right

557.279 --> 561.64
it's not even 5 yet hmm

570.32 --> 575.12
yeah i have a nice super late night

573.76 --> 577.8389999999999
dinner by the way

575.12 --> 577.839
ahead and pizza

578.08 --> 581.9590000000001
past four damn

596.08 --> 601.0400000000001
right so yeah i was

598.24 --> 603.36
very pleased with my show yesterday

601.04 --> 606.24
was all over the place

603.36 --> 606.24
but it was good

606.8 --> 612.12
i put by the way the whole facts aids in

609.36 --> 615.04
the title didn't get any

612.12 --> 616.88
notification or anything

615.04 --> 619.8389999999999
so apparently youtube really doesn't

616.88 --> 619.8389999999999
care

623.68 --> 626.2399999999999
that's fine

630.24 --> 635.92
hey that fellow yeah i saw your super

632.48 --> 635.9200000000001
chat insurance

644.24 --> 647.5600000000001
how are you doing

668.16 --> 670.399
hmm

671.839 --> 676.8000000000001
a lot of heavy dreaming again this this

674.48 --> 676.8000000000001
night

679.04 --> 683.4399999999999
it's interesting hey yeah exactly that's

681.6 --> 686.76
what i saw over there thank you that

683.44 --> 686.7600000000001
flat fellow

691.44 --> 695.519
it's kind of i feel weird because i'm

693.68 --> 698.3199999999999
feeling really relaxed i know i've

695.519 --> 700.399
dreamt pretty heavily

698.32 --> 703.519
now i just don't really remember anymore

700.399 --> 706.48
what it was about though

703.519 --> 708.5600000000001
but it was again building oriented i

706.48 --> 710.24
felt yeah even when i was much younger i

708.56 --> 712.88
had a

710.24 --> 717.12
lot of building dreams it's always like

712.88 --> 718.959
me going around in some mysterious

717.12 --> 722.32
building

718.959 --> 724.56
with architecture and staircases and

722.32 --> 726.48
sometimes it's like surreal sometimes

724.56 --> 731.4399999999999
it's more straightforward

726.48 --> 733.6
a representation of an actual building

731.44 --> 735.519
like that could be normal

733.6 --> 738.72
but yeah

735.519 --> 743.72
in dreams i go about buildings a lot

738.72 --> 743.72
and that happened too i think this night

745.44 --> 750.5600000000001
it's weird because

746.88 --> 753.12
it can like happen in a sense that

750.56 --> 757.1199999999999
some social scenario takes place i'm

753.12 --> 757.12
like interacting with somebody and then

757.2 --> 762.639
communicating feeling things out

759.92 --> 764.3199999999999
and then i like notice like hey where

762.639 --> 766.639
actually am i

764.32 --> 769.279
hmm

766.639 --> 771.2
and then like i just

769.279 --> 773.04
at the angle of approach of the

771.2 --> 775.279
situation i just assumed like i'm

773.04 --> 778.959
somewhere familiar right and then it's

775.279 --> 778.959
almost like the dreamscape

779.2 --> 784.5600000000001
molds itself towards that expectation

781.68 --> 787.76
but when i actually start to then zone

784.56 --> 789.8389999999999
in on it a bit and look at the

787.76 --> 791.92
architecture then it turns out that it's

789.839 --> 794.32
actually nothing like any familiar

791.92 --> 794.3199999999999
building

795.44 --> 801.72
that happens a lot it's weird it's weird

797.92 --> 801.7199999999999
how that works in dreams

804.48 --> 807.839
right

805.36 --> 808.9590000000001
a lot of what you get to see is built by

807.839 --> 810.9590000000001
your inner

808.959 --> 812.2399999999999
expectations like

810.959 --> 813.8389999999999
what the

812.24 --> 816.5600000000001
what you get to see is really a

813.839 --> 819.44
reflection of what your experience is

816.56 --> 819.4399999999999
like at the time

819.92 --> 826.12
anyway

822.0 --> 826.12
oh look at the sun

835.279 --> 842.519
he's five thousand

837.6 --> 842.519
dollars a month on patreon jesus

843.6 --> 846.48
that's

845.199 --> 849.4799999999999
that's

846.48 --> 849.48
insane

862.399 --> 868.68
i mean i'm not nothing against it but

864.88 --> 868.68
man that's a lot

870.48 --> 873.839
i got like

871.92 --> 875.68
what is it

873.839 --> 877.12
25 euros

875.68 --> 880.2399999999999
a month

877.12 --> 882.079
on patreon that's about it

880.24 --> 883.839
i'm still very thankful for those that

882.079 --> 887.519
are part of my patreon but yeah it's

883.839 --> 887.519
never been like this huge thing

889.44 --> 893.44
and then yeah

890.959 --> 897.4399999999999
i don't know

893.44 --> 900.32
jaren is very entertaining though

897.44 --> 904.1600000000001
and in his own way he is much more media

900.32 --> 906.48
trained he is much more just

904.16 --> 908.8
entertaining you kind of always know

906.48 --> 912.1990000000001
what you're gonna expect you always know

908.8 --> 912.199
what to expect

912.8 --> 916.959
right with me that's kind of different

923.6 --> 929.48
professor jeff what hey kevlar

962.24 --> 965.92
you all calling yourselves professor

966.839 --> 972.8000000000001
now uh

969.68 --> 972.8
right that flat fellow

974.88 --> 978.8
yeah i know jaren has done a lot of

976.639 --> 980.9590000000001
great work and he has been building up

978.8 --> 982.56
to it for a very long time so i do think

980.959 --> 986.399
he deserves it too

982.56 --> 988.959
but i am jealous in a sense because

986.399 --> 991.12
i don't really like that i sometimes

988.959 --> 994.88
just have to beg

991.12 --> 997.6
well he blatantly now i guess doesn't

994.88 --> 1000.88
have to because he can just get that's

997.6 --> 1000.88
like an insane amount

1001.68 --> 1006.3199999999999
that's literally five times my social

1003.839 --> 1006.32
welfare

1007.12 --> 1011.6
right if i get that amount of support i

1009.6 --> 1015.36
would not need to be on social welfare

1011.6 --> 1015.36
i'd get off it very quickly

1018.72 --> 1021.12
anyway

1021.6 --> 1027.3600000000001
but yeah jaren does have good production

1024.64 --> 1029.199
quality in what he does

1027.36 --> 1031.6789999999999
he does have like

1029.199 --> 1034.64
a lot of storage of good footage that he

1031.679 --> 1036.88
uses very effectively

1034.64 --> 1039.8390000000002
i don't really do that i don't do my

1036.88 --> 1039.8390000000002
show like that

1040.959 --> 1045.76
and that's saved me some room in my head

1044.079 --> 1047.839
so that when

1045.76 --> 1049.12
the moment arrives i can focus very

1047.839 --> 1051.28
sharply

1049.12 --> 1053.6
on whatever i'm trying to figure out

1051.28 --> 1055.2
which can be quite on the edge and

1053.6 --> 1057.4399999999998
complicated something where jaren

1055.2 --> 1059.52
doesn't typically go like that

1057.44 --> 1061.919
so it's more smoothened out for the

1059.52 --> 1063.44
wider audience

1061.919 --> 1064.5590000000002
media trade

1063.44 --> 1066.4
right

1064.559 --> 1069.12
but yeah

1066.4 --> 1071.6000000000001
i guess that does basically make a lot

1069.12 --> 1074.4799999999998
of people lose interest that are not

1071.6 --> 1076.32
really there for those special moments

1074.48 --> 1077.6
that don't have the patience to sit

1076.32 --> 1079.4399999999998
through it

1077.6 --> 1082.48
that are just looking for now i just

1079.44 --> 1084.24
want some flat earth space fluff or

1082.48 --> 1086.48
something

1084.24 --> 1087.84
just

1086.48 --> 1089.919
basically

1087.84 --> 1092.1599999999999
hanging around with a friend looking at

1089.919 --> 1093.679
silly old space footage and laughing

1092.16 --> 1095.6000000000001
about it right

1093.679 --> 1098.0800000000002
that's a good formula gerund's very

1095.6 --> 1099.76
effective at it

1098.08 --> 1101.84
and i think that there's a lot of people

1099.76 --> 1104.4
that like that

1101.84 --> 1105.76
and they'll be glad to pay for that it's

1104.4 --> 1106.96
around

1105.76 --> 1110.559
so yeah

1106.96 --> 1110.559
i can't really compete with that

1115.039 --> 1119.36
over on bev

1116.799 --> 1123.4
try thinking winding up the trolls oh

1119.36 --> 1123.3999999999999
okay jeff gassett

1124.96 --> 1127.679
when was that

1128.799 --> 1135.4
because

1130.559 --> 1135.3999999999999
i don't think i'm even subscribed to bev

1138.799 --> 1143.28
but maybe i should just to check it out

1145.36 --> 1149.1999999999998
it's just that i

1147.28 --> 1151.84
don't really have a

1149.2 --> 1151.8400000000001
liking

1151.919 --> 1155.4
to that guy

1164.4 --> 1167.1200000000001
nope

1168.96 --> 1172.16
nope not subscribe

1174.0 --> 1178.48
most of his patreon stuff is crypto

1176.32 --> 1182.0
content all right yeah yeah of course

1178.48 --> 1184.24
that yeah jaron's gone into that as well

1182.0 --> 1186.4
and i'm not really going there i mean i

1184.24 --> 1188.32
have crypto links available for

1186.4 --> 1191.5590000000002
donations but i don't think i've even

1188.32 --> 1191.559
had one

1192.16 --> 1194.48
and

1194.64 --> 1199.919
i don't know i i made it available just

1197.12 --> 1202.08
so that some people that weren't able to

1199.919 --> 1203.1200000000001
just donate money through paypal or

1202.08 --> 1204.72
something

1203.12 --> 1206.8799999999999
that they could do it like that if they

1204.72 --> 1210.08
were if they happen to be in that but it

1206.88 --> 1212.3200000000002
hasn't really happened yet so

1210.08 --> 1214.8799999999999
i've been thinking of just taking those

1212.32 --> 1219.1589999999999
links away again

1214.88 --> 1219.159
nothing really happening with it

1221.44 --> 1224.96
hey william double j

1226.4 --> 1230.72
all right and yeah i am not super

1228.559 --> 1232.53
interested in crypto

1230.72 --> 1233.76
i never really talk about it

1232.53 --> 1236.0
[Music]

1233.76 --> 1238.32
like even the guys from the flat earth

1236.0 --> 1240.96
debate often

1238.32 --> 1243.2
after the after show

1240.96 --> 1245.3600000000001
eventually end up talking about it and

1243.2 --> 1248.32
then i just kind of get bored because

1245.36 --> 1251.32
it's not my thing i'm just not really

1248.32 --> 1251.32
interested

1267.84 --> 1271.76
all of his patreon is crypto

1271.84 --> 1276.72
what do you mean

1274.48 --> 1279.72
what what i didn't understand that black

1276.72 --> 1279.72
fellow

1323.679 --> 1326.48
or

1324.48 --> 1328.88
just nothing just

1326.48 --> 1328.88
nothing

1329.12 --> 1335.76
his patreon is for crypto class oh he

1331.919 --> 1335.76
reserves it specifically for that

1338.4 --> 1340.72
okay

1345.2 --> 1349.44
hmm

1347.76 --> 1351.679
well i guess if he's pretty good at it

1349.44 --> 1357.0800000000002
he can get people to

1351.679 --> 1357.0800000000002
yeah to actually pay for classes i guess

1372.96 --> 1377.919
right

1374.559 --> 1377.9189999999999
hey lydia logs yes

1379.6 --> 1383.6
well

1380.72 --> 1386.0
i know about crypto

1383.6 --> 1387.6
just about as much as i know about

1386.0 --> 1389.44
programming although that's not true i

1387.6 --> 1392.24
know more about programming right i

1389.44 --> 1394.3200000000002
can't program actually but i know how it

1392.24 --> 1396.0
works

1394.32 --> 1397.4399999999998
and i know some history of its

1396.0 --> 1400.72
development

1397.44 --> 1400.72
and i know programmers

1401.52 --> 1404.48
how they operate

1405.36 --> 1411.039
but yeah crypto is kind of like that i i

1408.159 --> 1413.6000000000001
have a very rough feel for what it is

1411.039 --> 1418.32
and how it functions but

1413.6 --> 1418.32
i can't really get a good grasp on it

1418.559 --> 1422.3999999999999
but i've seen other people deal with

1420.559 --> 1424.72
crypto and that

1422.4 --> 1426.72
actually if you can get into it it's not

1424.72 --> 1431.24
that hard

1426.72 --> 1431.24
although it can take up a lot of time

1452.24 --> 1456.279
yeah kevlar me too

1481.279 --> 1486.44
you have to wait months for the price to

1483.44 --> 1486.44
drop

1486.64 --> 1491.5590000000002
right because there are swings right

1488.559 --> 1491.559
youtube

1510.0 --> 1514.48
yeah okay well yeah that makes perfect

1512.559 --> 1516.32
sense that that felt it's really

1514.48 --> 1519.279
smart

1516.32 --> 1521.6789999999999
again i'm kind of jealous

1519.279 --> 1524.32
but yeah then again i've never been much

1521.679 --> 1527.5590000000002
of a business guy

1524.32 --> 1527.559
like that

1528.48 --> 1534.24
i'm just i'm more about like how do i

1531.039 --> 1534.24
keep the flow going

1535.679 --> 1540.159
and

1537.12 --> 1543.36
improvisation quality

1540.159 --> 1545.3600000000001
and yeah that's not

1543.36 --> 1548.36
that doesn't exactly make me business

1545.36 --> 1548.36
heavy

1579.12 --> 1583.7199999999998
you messed up what okay youtube

1591.279 --> 1596.159
okay is that good or bad i don't know

1593.039 --> 1597.919
where it's at right now

1596.159 --> 1600.159
right i don't really want to be talking

1597.919 --> 1602.96
about crypto too much because i have

1600.159 --> 1605.5200000000002
nothing really to add it's all about

1602.96 --> 1608.0
just knowing the swings and all

1605.52 --> 1611.8799999999999
pay attention right now yeah well i'm

1608.0 --> 1611.88
not doing any of that

1624.72 --> 1627.72
hmm

1643.76 --> 1647.64
right

1644.64 --> 1647.64
anyway

1656.32 --> 1660.6399999999999
yeah

1657.36 --> 1663.36
what i do i pretty much do for free

1660.64 --> 1666.48
and i can't just automate it like if i'm

1663.36 --> 1667.52
gonna teach somebody

1666.48 --> 1669.919
and

1667.52 --> 1673.039
like be good at it it's gonna be a

1669.919 --> 1673.039
one-on-one thing and

1678.64 --> 1682.48
it just

1679.6 --> 1684.7199999999998
i can't really get money entangled like

1682.48 --> 1684.72
that

1688.559 --> 1694.559
i mean i i do yeah that's

1692.0 --> 1697.039
if people are gonna give it to me

1694.559 --> 1700.8799999999999
and like honor that well

1697.039 --> 1704.72
kind of leave me alone about uh

1700.88 --> 1704.72
sorry i'm not formulating this correctly

1705.679 --> 1709.8400000000001
let me say that

1707.679 --> 1711.6000000000001
if people can respect that i'm just not

1709.84 --> 1713.12
really

1711.6 --> 1715.279
a business guy

1713.12 --> 1717.4399999999998
but still need maintenance

1715.279 --> 1720.08
then i can then i don't have to bother

1717.44 --> 1722.799
and i can just give

1720.08 --> 1725.84
whatever i need to give without worry

1722.799 --> 1728.48
right so that's my strategy

1725.84 --> 1731.279
it's like i don't know populist

1728.48 --> 1734.32
socialism or something i don't that that

1731.279 --> 1736.32
probably wouldn't make any sense

1734.32 --> 1737.76
but like yeah i can keep going i'll help

1736.32 --> 1741.36
anybody

1737.76 --> 1743.76
but i need to be helped too because

1741.36 --> 1745.84
i'm just not really good at that it's i

1743.76 --> 1747.84
find it extremely distracting and if i

1745.84 --> 1749.9189999999999
focus on money that's actually going to

1747.84 --> 1753.48
take away

1749.919 --> 1753.48
my main skill

1767.84 --> 1772.32
what flat fellow that's crazy

1773.52 --> 1778.76
yeah max geyser yeah i remember max

1775.76 --> 1778.76
geyser

1787.279 --> 1793.039
yeah he oh max geyser got a whole bunch

1789.919 --> 1795.2
out of cryptocurrency i remember like

1793.039 --> 1797.679
was it 10 years ago when he was already

1795.2 --> 1800.32
bragging about it

1797.679 --> 1804.1200000000001
with alex jones and all that alex never

1800.32 --> 1804.12
really got into it

1823.039 --> 1826.399
wait who are we talking about

1827.6 --> 1833.039
why you mean kamala

1830.72 --> 1835.3600000000001
she said two-thirds of americans have

1833.039 --> 1837.52
died in the last night

1835.36 --> 1840.24
yeah that

1837.52 --> 1841.76
like somebody just haul her away she

1840.24 --> 1844.48
needs

1841.76 --> 1846.8799999999999
a padded room or some sedative or

1844.48 --> 1846.88
something

1848.32 --> 1853.76
is she maybe she's just blatantly trying

1851.279 --> 1856.48
to show fear

1853.76 --> 1859.279
just create a panic maybe it's gotten to

1856.48 --> 1863.0
that stage they're like trying to create

1859.279 --> 1863.0
short-term panic

1867.12 --> 1871.039
which would by the way be a sign that

1868.799 --> 1873.76
they're losing complete

1871.039 --> 1876.0
grip on the entire situation that they

1873.76 --> 1877.679
allow that to happen

1876.0 --> 1879.279
with each other that they allow each

1877.679 --> 1882.88
other to do that

1879.279 --> 1885.36
that means like okay they're losing grip

1882.88 --> 1888.64
just make the people that can't stop

1885.36 --> 1891.6
buying into their [ __ ] panic

1888.64 --> 1894.7990000000002
and squirt and i don't know

1891.6 --> 1897.12
to exploit them or something

1894.799 --> 1899.76
and then

1897.12 --> 1904.12
i don't know what they're going to do

1899.76 --> 1904.12
maybe they will get arrested

1906.88 --> 1910.88
i mean i wouldn't be surprised if just

1908.799 --> 1912.32
one day like the entire white house is

1910.88 --> 1915.3600000000001
just like

1912.32 --> 1915.36
suddenly arrested

1916.88 --> 1922.48
just like that

1919.519 --> 1924.88
and then it would almost seem like

1922.48 --> 1926.32
like it's not even a real government

1924.88 --> 1928.7990000000002
like

1926.32 --> 1931.36
like it's an act and then the police are

1928.799 --> 1933.6
stopping the actors

1931.36 --> 1937.7199999999998
it would be very weird if that happens

1933.6 --> 1937.7199999999998
but it might just happen

1968.159 --> 1973.0
what's the way to life speaking

1970.0 --> 1973.0
metaphysics

1981.44 --> 1988.559
well maybe she was trying to like plant

1984.64 --> 1988.5590000000002
some esoterics of some kind

1989.2 --> 1994.0
maybe she's telling you what the future

1991.679 --> 1996.159
plan is that they actually are engaging

1994.0 --> 1998.64
in something so radical and crazy that

1996.159 --> 2001.3600000000001
it is gonna get two-thirds of americans

1998.64 --> 2004.76
killed right you don't never really know

2001.36 --> 2004.76
with these people

2006.559 --> 2010.399
but we do know about

2008.48 --> 2012.799
the whole of that system

2010.399 --> 2013.84
what they do that they always project

2012.799 --> 2015.6
whatever they're doing they're

2013.84 --> 2017.4399999999998
projecting always

2015.6 --> 2020.559
they're projecting something

2017.44 --> 2022.3990000000001
right always projecting something

2020.559 --> 2023.84
so it might be a projection from the

2022.399 --> 2025.6
future of something that they're going

2023.84 --> 2027.9189999999999
to do

2025.6 --> 2030.32
and they misplace it into the past so

2027.919 --> 2033.279
confusion maybe they're just sewing

2030.32 --> 2035.6
panic to get some more people to support

2033.279 --> 2035.6
maybe

2040.88 --> 2047.3600000000001
or maybe kamala was just like really in

2044.159 --> 2050.48
a freaky mood and nobody had the heart

2047.36 --> 2053.04
to stop her they just let her like okay

2050.48 --> 2055.76
camala you do whatever the [ __ ] you want

2053.04 --> 2059.639
nobody cares right now i don't know man

2055.76 --> 2059.639
it could be all of those

2065.76 --> 2068.76
so

2080.24 --> 2083.839
yeah right that the whole uh

2085.2 --> 2092.6389999999997
hello william double j

2088.96 --> 2092.639
found that he died

2093.119 --> 2095.359
no

2101.52 --> 2104.32
no

2102.48 --> 2106.48
no billion double j there's no way

2104.32 --> 2107.44
that's gonna happen

2106.48 --> 2109.92
and

2107.44 --> 2112.7200000000003
even if it did happen you would know by

2109.92 --> 2116.32
that basically the other players would

2112.72 --> 2119.1189999999997
take over the role

2116.32 --> 2119.119
very quickly

2129.119 --> 2131.839
no

2139.92 --> 2144.48
like i seriously where are you getting

2142.4 --> 2146.4
like the idea from that they can even do

2144.48 --> 2148.88
that

2146.4 --> 2152.839
with mwj like where the [ __ ] are you

2148.88 --> 2152.839
getting that idea from

2189.599 --> 2192.839
hey gordzilla

2221.04 --> 2224.72
no that flat fellow can't see it

2224.88 --> 2228.88
dude i'll just

2226.4 --> 2231.88
give you a wrench just post it again in

2228.88 --> 2231.88
full

2253.44 --> 2259.52
it will never put yes it will if you got

2256.16 --> 2262.0789999999997
a wrench you can post links

2259.52 --> 2265.32
flat fellow got a link i got a wrench

2262.079 --> 2265.32
now so

2282.64 --> 2288.4
who's her where i think that uh

2286.48 --> 2292.32
they were talking about kamala harris

2288.4 --> 2295.52
the vice president of the united states

2292.32 --> 2299.839
and she said apparently that

2295.52 --> 2299.839
two-thirds of americans had died

2302.24 --> 2308.7599999999998
in the last 90 days because of the

2304.48 --> 2308.76
pandemic like what the [ __ ]

2321.599 --> 2327.839
no i'm not seeing the link that fellow i

2324.16 --> 2327.839
don't know why but i'm not seeing it

2334.079 --> 2337.079
dude

2362.8 --> 2367.7200000000003
look

2364.72 --> 2367.72
finally

2372.32 --> 2376.2400000000002
americans who just in the last several

2374.0 --> 2379.359
months died what

2376.24 --> 2382.72
over 220 million americans who just in

2379.359 --> 2384.72
the last several months died what 220

2382.72 --> 2387.2
million americans that's more than 60

2384.72 --> 2389.1189999999997
percent of our population roughly 350

2387.2 --> 2390.72
million people live in this country so

2389.119 --> 2392.88
either while i was sleeping more than

2390.72 --> 2396.5989999999997
half the country was wiped out or kamala

2392.88 --> 2396.599
harris is an idiot

2396.88 --> 2400.32
wow

2398.88 --> 2401.76
come on man

2400.32 --> 2403.52
yeah

2401.76 --> 2405.92
thanks for the link

2403.52 --> 2405.92
bam

2407.76 --> 2413.2400000000002
that's

2409.52 --> 2413.24
that's quite naughty

2419.08 --> 2422.369
[Applause]

2426.99 --> 2430.31
[Applause]

2438.25 --> 2441.869
[Applause]

2445.44 --> 2448.44
uh

2449.08 --> 2456.5299999999997
[Applause]

2457.599 --> 2463.6400000000003
i'm definitely reposting that in skype

2460.16 --> 2463.64
thanks for the link

2469.04 --> 2472.04
uh

2490.64 --> 2495.839
i wonder though like maybe she just

2492.64 --> 2497.1189999999997
slipped up and actually meant to say 220

2495.839 --> 2499.52
000

2497.119 --> 2502.2400000000002
i don't know if that would be anywhere

2499.52 --> 2504.8
closer to some official statistic

2502.24 --> 2506.839
this is probably misspeaking saying

2504.8 --> 2509.92
million

2506.839 --> 2513.119
this there's just no way that she'd

2509.92 --> 2513.119
actually think that

2518.48 --> 2523.839
it's hilarious though

2520.319 --> 2523.839
it is really funny

2531.2 --> 2537.839
to make the dumb even dumber yeah

2534.079 --> 2537.8390000000004
could very well be

2545.15 --> 2548.2290000000003
[Music]

2568.48 --> 2573.92
yeah thank you that yeah indeed i do

2572.24 --> 2576.0789999999997
report it

2573.92 --> 2579.079
what

2576.079 --> 2579.079
oh

2617.04 --> 2621.359
right yeah yeah it is kind of youtube

2619.28 --> 2623.8390000000004
you've got a good point there it is and

2621.359 --> 2625.92
it can definitely be considered testing

2623.839 --> 2628.56
the waters it's just like

2625.92 --> 2629.28
okay let's throw something that's

2628.56 --> 2631.2
like

2629.28 --> 2633.52
what's one of the most ridiculous things

2631.2 --> 2636.0789999999997
you can think of that's

2633.52 --> 2638.56
not like super straightforward obvious

2636.079 --> 2640.8
it's just like

2638.56 --> 2641.92
a mathematical mistake or something and

2640.8 --> 2644.5600000000004
let's just

2641.92 --> 2646.839
see if people pick up on it and how they

2644.56 --> 2649.44
respond to test their

2646.839 --> 2652.7999999999997
intelligence put a mistake in front of

2649.44 --> 2654.4
them see how they respond

2652.8 --> 2656.5600000000004
they probably

2654.4 --> 2659.04
want to try to size up how everything's

2656.56 --> 2662.16
changed

2659.04 --> 2664.16
because things like the mindsets thanks

2662.16 --> 2666.96
to all the information going around does

2664.16 --> 2668.8799999999997
change around on average

2666.96 --> 2671.04
and they're sizing it up by saying

2668.88 --> 2674.2400000000002
something really stupid and see still

2671.04 --> 2677.839
how many people are on their side

2674.24 --> 2677.839
how many people accept it

2678.319 --> 2685.0
it's basically testing how far can they

2680.56 --> 2685.0
go with their psychological warfare

2692.16 --> 2696.319
maybe she slipped up what's coming soon

2694.079 --> 2697.8390000000004
maybe next three yeah well that's that's

2696.319 --> 2701.96
another possibility it might be a

2697.839 --> 2701.96
projection onto the future

2707.119 --> 2710.8
like maybe it's an announcement of the

2709.119 --> 2712.56
damage that they're gonna do with what

2710.8 --> 2713.92
they're planning to do

2712.56 --> 2715.92
who knows

2713.92 --> 2717.92
maybe that's what they expect

2715.92 --> 2719.76
how many americans will die after

2717.92 --> 2722.8
they've triggered

2719.76 --> 2723.8390000000004
full out war with russia

2722.8 --> 2727.44
right

2723.839 --> 2729.44
would would that be an off number

2727.44 --> 2732.48
two thirds i think

2729.44 --> 2735.04
that might not be too far off for the

2732.48 --> 2737.359
amount of dead americans

2735.04 --> 2739.7599999999998
that would happen if like a full out war

2737.359 --> 2742.48
with russia started

2739.76 --> 2744.3190000000004
and it seems like they want that i've

2742.48 --> 2746.56
been predicting that too

2744.319 --> 2748.48
they're just keeping poking that bear

2746.56 --> 2750.24
they're just

2748.48 --> 2753.119
trying to force it

2750.24 --> 2753.1189999999997
to strike at him

2757.28 --> 2762.6400000000003
while at the same time making everybody

2759.359 --> 2764.0789999999997
stupid and deranged and

2762.64 --> 2765.92
breaking yeah

2764.079 --> 2767.28
breaking everybody's concentration

2765.92 --> 2769.52
ability

2767.28 --> 2773.7200000000003
so that when the bear strikes america's

2769.52 --> 2773.72
just gonna be a sitting duck

2775.359 --> 2780.16
so maybe it is a prediction like that

2777.839 --> 2782.72
maybe it's a projection it's like oh

2780.16 --> 2785.2
this is so many dead and then she's just

2782.72 --> 2787.2799999999997
reenacting something that she knows is

2785.2 --> 2789.04
coming in the future

2787.28 --> 2791.6800000000003
you never really know too sure with

2789.04 --> 2791.68
these people

2794.56 --> 2801.319
but if you take it literally yeah then

2797.359 --> 2801.319
that's absolutely idiotic

2806.48 --> 2811.56
and i wanted to use the number 66.6

2811.599 --> 2814.599
sure

2821.839 --> 2825.319
could be too

2855.68 --> 2861.0
well terror 306 that's heavy [ __ ]

2873.52 --> 2878.16
if you think two-thirds of the

2874.96 --> 2880.2400000000002
population died the earth is a globe

2878.16 --> 2881.04
well if you actually buy into that on

2880.24 --> 2883.839
the

2881.04 --> 2885.7599999999998
that it's actually happened recently

2883.839 --> 2887.52
then you probably also think the earth

2885.76 --> 2889.44
is a globe because anything else would

2887.52 --> 2892.24
be too difficult

2889.44 --> 2893.04
if that's what you mean kevlar

2892.24 --> 2894.72
but

2893.04 --> 2896.48
yeah i don't think that just because you

2894.72 --> 2898.7999999999997
believe the earth is a globe you're

2896.48 --> 2901.44
gonna buy into that two-third of the

2898.8 --> 2903.04
united states people just died because

2901.44 --> 2905.28
of the pandemic

2903.04 --> 2907.599
because kamala harris said so

2905.28 --> 2907.599
that's

2908.24 --> 2912.9599999999996
no globbers

2910.319 --> 2915.119
might be like

2912.96 --> 2917.76
yeah i might have perfected weaponized

2915.119 --> 2919.2000000000003
stupidity and ignorance they're not that

2917.76 --> 2920.559
stupid though

2919.2 --> 2923.52
right it's

2920.559 --> 2927.599
it's deliberate they made it that stupid

2923.52 --> 2927.599
they're not naturally that stupid

2927.68 --> 2931.2799999999997
because if you were naturally that

2929.28 --> 2934.48
stupid you wouldn't even have the

2931.28 --> 2937.119
faculties to figure out anything about

2934.48 --> 2937.119
math or

2938.8 --> 2941.8
geometry

2947.68 --> 2950.68
right

2956.559 --> 2959.6000000000004
that's debatable no

2959.359 --> 2962.64
no

2959.6 --> 2965.68
[Music]

2962.64 --> 2965.68
no flip flat

2966.48 --> 2971.0
rocket man oh dear

2974.64 --> 2979.68
do you have any evidence

2976.8 --> 2983.8390000000004
evidence that somebody will what

2979.68 --> 2985.7599999999998
a rocket man will find out soon enough

2983.839 --> 2987.839
they're not claiming any evidence that

2985.76 --> 2990.559
anybody believes what she said i'm just

2987.839 --> 2992.72
laying out the possibilities of

2990.559 --> 2997.3190000000004
why she done that

2992.72 --> 2997.319
what it means what it stands for

2998.64 --> 3001.92
and that's it

3000.48 --> 3005.359
not making any

3001.92 --> 3007.119
like solid claims here

3005.359 --> 3011.24
except for that it's technically

3007.119 --> 3011.2400000000002
incorrect if you took it literally

3015.68 --> 3020.72
she clearly slipped up oh well really

3018.319 --> 3023.2
did she so clearly so was it corrected

3020.72 --> 3025.68
immediately

3023.2 --> 3027.68
if you clearly slip up

3025.68 --> 3030.72
and it's that obvious

3027.68 --> 3032.16
and not on purpose then you correct it

3030.72 --> 3034.16
right

3032.16 --> 3036.319
because you're not supposed to want to

3034.16 --> 3038.319
look like an ass

3036.319 --> 3041.319
especially if you're freaking vice

3038.319 --> 3041.319
president

3057.04 --> 3061.04
all right well i'll just browse around

3059.68 --> 3064.24
on

3061.04 --> 3068.119
infowars if there's anything god damn it

3064.24 --> 3068.1189999999997
there's anything about it

3070.88 --> 3073.52
jesus

3078.559 --> 3082.7200000000003
but

3080.079 --> 3086.2400000000002
is it like an older clip

3082.72 --> 3086.24
because i'm not seeing anything

3094.16 --> 3098.7999999999997
but if i remember correctly even way

3096.24 --> 3102.0789999999997
back like years back she was already

3098.8 --> 3104.88
sometimes saying really stupid things

3102.079 --> 3107.2000000000003
i just never really cared that much

3104.88 --> 3111.2400000000002
at the time

3107.2 --> 3111.24
to make mention of it

3120.24 --> 3124.4799999999996
source for the full original video yeah

3122.0 --> 3128.119
that would be nice i don't know if

3124.48 --> 3128.119
anybody has that

3146.0 --> 3149.44
it's tradition

3150.559 --> 3154.4
what kind of a tradition is that

3154.8 --> 3158.4
like seriously

3156.559 --> 3161.76
look are you listening to yourself

3158.4 --> 3164.1600000000003
rocket man a tradition

3161.76 --> 3166.559
for american political leaders to slip

3164.16 --> 3169.04
up really so that implies it's on

3166.559 --> 3169.0400000000004
purpose

3169.28 --> 3172.6400000000003
that

3170.4 --> 3176.079
is

3172.64 --> 3179.4
i don't know what to say about that

3176.079 --> 3179.4
like why

3180.48 --> 3184.4
being flippant okay

3188.0 --> 3193.28
look at the cheeto was last night well

3190.48 --> 3195.119
hey trump did not slip up that many

3193.28 --> 3197.6800000000003
times

3195.119 --> 3200.079
i mean he slipped up a couple of times

3197.68 --> 3202.3999999999996
with his tweets

3200.079 --> 3203.8390000000004
there's weird words rolling out of that

3202.4 --> 3206.4
and all that but

3203.839 --> 3208.4
no trump is actually

3206.4 --> 3210.319
really good at public speaking he

3208.4 --> 3212.8
doesn't slip up

3210.319 --> 3216.2799999999997
barely and if he does he very quickly

3212.8 --> 3216.28
corrects himself

3230.64 --> 3234.4
i heard was that she said millions

3232.48 --> 3237.4
instead i thought yes that's that is an

3234.4 --> 3237.4
option

3237.68 --> 3242.48
but still would that make any sense

3239.839 --> 3242.48
would that be

3242.64 --> 3246.96
like

3243.52 --> 3249.2
quotable referenceable to any data that

3246.96 --> 3251.68
she got

3249.2 --> 3253.9199999999996
because obviously if it was millions it

3251.68 --> 3256.8799999999997
makes absolutely no sense there is no

3253.92 --> 3259.76
stat that says that

3256.88 --> 3262.8
but if it's thousands then maybe there

3259.76 --> 3265.28
is like oh yeah she had that in the

3262.8 --> 3269.28
current stats and she just read it wrong

3265.28 --> 3273.2400000000002
right then you have actual elite

3269.28 --> 3273.2400000000002
that it is a slip up

3280.0 --> 3283.839
ah okay rockman thanks for that

3282.96 --> 3287.319
yeah

3283.839 --> 3287.319
that makes sense

3306.079 --> 3309.079
uh

3331.52 --> 3335.24
not everybody yeah

3335.62 --> 3338.699
[Music]

3375.52 --> 3380.16
just projecting three months into the

3377.76 --> 3380.1600000000003
future

3383.839 --> 3388.0
just saying like

3385.599 --> 3390.4
just rough analysis this is purely

3388.0 --> 3392.079
hypothetical i didn't know when that was

3390.4 --> 3394.079
made

3392.079 --> 3396.7200000000003
just saying that's called a rough

3394.079 --> 3398.96
analysis it's just like not knowing and

3396.72 --> 3401.5989999999997
sizing up what it can be right i do the

3398.96 --> 3403.44
same thing with cosmogeny

3401.599 --> 3406.1600000000003
what's wrong about that what's wrong

3403.44 --> 3408.64
about trying to figure out what could be

3406.16 --> 3410.319
going on based on logical reasoning

3408.64 --> 3413.52
that's not wrong

3410.319 --> 3418.48
it's just not all data is complete

3413.52 --> 3420.64
but since you retrieve that data somehow

3418.48 --> 3422.799
i don't know even how you got that so

3420.64 --> 3425.44
quickly

3422.799 --> 3429.68
so it turns out to be from two years ago

3425.44 --> 3431.52
and indeed my suspicion about stats

3429.68 --> 3434.24
was it

3431.52 --> 3438.24
sounds like wild yeah that is what it is

3434.24 --> 3441.68
except i'm really good at wild gases

3438.24 --> 3441.68
yeah because i do that a lot

3441.839 --> 3447.04
wild guessing about that which is out of

3444.24 --> 3450.319
reach to know

3447.04 --> 3452.64
you searched the internet wow that's so

3450.319 --> 3453.359
specific man

3452.64 --> 3456.839
but

3453.359 --> 3456.839
yeah fine

3464.24 --> 3468.5589999999997
oh really rocket man so what did you do

3466.4 --> 3471.119
what was your 30 seconds of research

3468.559 --> 3474.119
yeah describe it for me exactly what you

3471.119 --> 3474.119
did

3474.48 --> 3480.559
did you just

3475.76 --> 3483.28
like google camala harris 220 million

3480.559 --> 3485.2000000000003
dead americans or something because then

3483.28 --> 3487.3590000000004
that's probably gonna link back to the

3485.2 --> 3489.5989999999997
moment when she said that

3487.359 --> 3493.92
in the search

3489.599 --> 3493.92
if you have a clean google engine

3495.839 --> 3500.52
yeah exactly that's what i thought

3527.68 --> 3531.839
get the [ __ ] out of here you [ __ ]

3534.24 --> 3540.0789999999997
every time you join it's just nasty [ __ ]

3538.0 --> 3543.079
comes out of you every time you are a

3540.079 --> 3543.079
troll

3561.119 --> 3565.4
right so yeah

3572.48 --> 3576.72
still thought it was a pretty funny

3574.0 --> 3579.92
video i don't think i've ever seen it

3576.72 --> 3579.9199999999996
in person before

3580.96 --> 3584.319
but

3581.76 --> 3585.5200000000004
yeah i do now kind of remember from back

3584.319 --> 3588.96
then

3585.52 --> 3588.96
that it was talked about

3589.04 --> 3594.24
i think i heard it like on the alex

3590.799 --> 3594.24
jones show somewhere or something

3597.76 --> 3604.88
but who knows maybe she had just said it

3600.64 --> 3604.8799999999997
again right it could have happened

3605.599 --> 3610.92
i don't know

3607.52 --> 3610.92
i didn't know

3636.24 --> 3644.72
right so anyway so i got 45 minutes

3640.88 --> 3644.7200000000003
and some nice sunlight look at that

3652.4 --> 3655.7200000000003
that's nice

3668.72 --> 3673.9199999999996
yeah that's a good one gaining wisdom

3671.04 --> 3673.92
but anyway

3678.72 --> 3682.839
what do you guys want to talk about

3728.16 --> 3734.0
hmm

3730.4 --> 3737.52
just got a headline from infowars

3734.0 --> 3739.52
apparently trudeau just said that

3737.52 --> 3741.44
the restrictions in canada were

3739.52 --> 3743.52
necessary to prevent further

3741.44 --> 3746.7200000000003
restrictions

3743.52 --> 3746.72
isn't that just special

3753.2 --> 3760.1189999999997
he's really trying out this mind control

3755.92 --> 3760.119
dictator thing isn't he

3811.28 --> 3814.7200000000003
what

3812.24 --> 3816.3999999999996
signs on the road that say stop sign

3814.72 --> 3819.72
ahead really

3816.4 --> 3819.7200000000003
those exist

3824.0 --> 3827.119
i've never seen those

3834.24 --> 3838.3999999999996
it's the trucker's fault now

3835.68 --> 3842.0789999999997
everything's the trucker's fault

3838.4 --> 3844.48
it's they are ruining the economy now

3842.079 --> 3844.48
i mean

3845.68 --> 3850.799
they're just like

3847.28 --> 3853.2000000000003
not doing their job and

3850.799 --> 3855.2
just sitting there obstructing things

3853.2 --> 3856.72
it's their fault that the economy is

3855.2 --> 3858.3999999999996
going to [ __ ]

3856.72 --> 3861.2799999999997
i mean it's not any of trudeau's

3858.4 --> 3863.599
policies that just forces people to go

3861.28 --> 3866.4
medical experimentation against their

3863.599 --> 3868.0
will

3866.4 --> 3869.2000000000003
just to keep their

3868.0 --> 3873.72
job and

3869.2 --> 3873.72
the society structure going

3881.119 --> 3886.559
yeah similar [ __ ] by the way is

3882.96 --> 3886.559
happening in the netherlands again too

3886.96 --> 3891.68
it's so annoying

3889.039 --> 3895.7200000000003
just like these people in our government

3891.68 --> 3895.72
so can't stand them

3897.039 --> 3899.28
like

3899.44 --> 3904.88
they are really like the rhombuses among

3902.319 --> 3906.839
the anti-flat earthers

3904.88 --> 3909.92
if the anti-flat earthers

3906.839 --> 3913.119
were politicians worldwide they are the

3909.92 --> 3917.44
rumpuses they are the worst

3913.119 --> 3917.44
the most repulsive the the most

3920.839 --> 3925.92
hell-bent so supposedly the restrictions

3923.92 --> 3928.16
here are being lifted blah blah blah but

3925.92 --> 3930.319
they're still forcing the qr code

3928.16 --> 3933.1189999999997
[ __ ] through

3930.319 --> 3934.16
it just doesn't make any sense

3933.119 --> 3936.48
it's just

3934.16 --> 3938.3999999999996
no yeah we don't know oh yeah we're

3936.48 --> 3940.559
doing it doing it anyway oh no but if

3938.4 --> 3942.17
we're not doing it but we're doing it

3940.559 --> 3944.1600000000003
though

3942.17 --> 3946.64
[Music]

3944.16 --> 3949.64
this freaking dutch cabinet is so

3946.64 --> 3949.64
annoying

3960.079 --> 3967.039
that bureaucracy expanding to meet the

3963.039 --> 3967.039
needs of the expanding bureaucracy

3968.48 --> 3972.799
yep

3969.839 --> 3976.359
isn't that like a salty

3972.799 --> 3976.359
quote or something

3980.079 --> 3987.079
i don't know sounds very

3982.72 --> 3987.0789999999997
soviet thing to say

4010.559 --> 4015.92
you got it from civilization six well

4012.88 --> 4017.2000000000003
they use quotes from

4015.92 --> 4019.52
from actual

4017.2 --> 4021.359
poets and

4019.52 --> 4025.4
government

4021.359 --> 4025.4
people and all that so

4067.359 --> 4071.119
confuse population divide and conquer

4069.28 --> 4072.1600000000003
well it's the reversed world method

4071.119 --> 4076.48
right

4072.16 --> 4079.2
it's the satanic system because it is

4076.48 --> 4081.68
very hardcore satanic and when i say

4079.2 --> 4084.8799999999997
satanic i mean

4081.68 --> 4087.52
reversed world inside out everything is

4084.88 --> 4091.039
a lie and like not just a lie it doesn't

4087.52 --> 4092.4
have lies everything is a perfect 180

4091.039 --> 4094.4
degrees

4092.4 --> 4095.92
reversed world lie

4094.4 --> 4098.08
and that's what they do that's how they

4095.92 --> 4100.4
confuse people because there's people

4098.08 --> 4102.96
out there that just cannot realize that

4100.4 --> 4105.199
that is what is happening

4102.96 --> 4108.96
they get stuck into the reversed world

4105.199 --> 4111.678999999999
mindset thinking that it's real

4108.96 --> 4114.08
it's it's very serious mind control

4111.679 --> 4115.92
magic and it is

4114.08 --> 4118.96
extremely evil

4115.92 --> 4122.4800000000005
really it's but it's elusive it's it is

4118.96 --> 4122.4800000000005
like raw mind control

4123.279 --> 4129.159000000001
it's the type of thing the empire in

4125.279 --> 4129.159000000001
star wars would do

4132.719 --> 4136.64
like when they

4134.239 --> 4138.718999999999
address the public and [ __ ]

4136.64 --> 4141.4400000000005
i mean not the commanders and all that

4138.719 --> 4141.44
probably but

4141.6 --> 4144.64
right

4142.88 --> 4147.1990000000005
that's what they do now they're all just

4144.64 --> 4149.04
coming out like yeah we are imperial

4147.199 --> 4150.96
dictators now

4149.04 --> 4153.12
we're mind control dictators so we're

4150.96 --> 4154.96
not actually dictators we're still bound

4153.12 --> 4157.5199999999995
by the positions and the powers that we

4154.96 --> 4160.64
were assigned to but we are now going to

4157.52 --> 4163.1990000000005
play part in an act where we're going to

4160.64 --> 4166.319
mind control everybody into submitting

4163.199 --> 4169.04
to us as dictators and that is what they

4166.319 --> 4170.64
do right so they aren't actually

4169.04 --> 4172.64
dictators

4170.64 --> 4176.88
but their mind controlling you into

4172.64 --> 4177.839
accepting them as your dictator

4176.88 --> 4179.359
that's

4177.839 --> 4181.2789999999995
the trick

4179.359 --> 4185.04
that's how they can just overpower

4181.279 --> 4186.96
things if enough people are weak minded

4185.04 --> 4188.799
and complacent

4186.96 --> 4190.159
and [ __ ]

4188.799 --> 4192.319
a lot

4190.159 --> 4194.799999999999
that's how they do it

4192.319 --> 4197.360000000001
they're not actually dictators

4194.8 --> 4200.4800000000005
if they can mind control enough people

4197.36 --> 4202.719
into accepting them as their dictator

4200.48 --> 4205.44
then they can effectively become

4202.719 --> 4205.44
dictators

4211.52 --> 4215.84
and i think that yeah

4213.52 --> 4218.320000000001
trudeau is a pretty good example of that

4215.84 --> 4221.04
right now

4218.32 --> 4223.04
but so are like these the dutch

4221.04 --> 4224.88
politicians over here that are in

4223.04 --> 4227.36
control sort of even though they

4224.88 --> 4227.36
shouldn't be

4228.239 --> 4232.48
because it's not even a full cabinet as

4230.4 --> 4234.159
far as i remember

4232.48 --> 4235.36
or maybe they fixed that though i don't

4234.159 --> 4237.599999999999
know man i

4235.36 --> 4239.28
i can't keep track of this freaking

4237.6 --> 4242.0
political [ __ ] in the netherlands

4239.28 --> 4244.8
anymore like i can't i like i really

4242.0 --> 4246.88
can't keep track of it it's so

4244.8 --> 4249.12
aggravating

4246.88 --> 4251.84
think like

4249.12 --> 4254.239
like it's only rhombuses it's only like

4251.84 --> 4256.32
a hundred rumpus

4254.239 --> 4258.959999999999
and they're all just blabbering and just

4256.32 --> 4261.84
trying to nitpick and and distracted in

4258.96 --> 4265.36
like hours and hours and hours of

4261.84 --> 4266.8
hundreds of rhombuses okay i can't keep

4265.36 --> 4269.44
track of what's going on in the

4266.8 --> 4271.84
netherlands like i really can't it's too

4269.44 --> 4274.879999999999
painful

4271.84 --> 4279.12
people that do must be like very trained

4274.88 --> 4279.12
specifically to be able to handle that

4280.48 --> 4284.639999999999
they must be and they look like they are

4282.64 --> 4286.56
because these people are like

4284.64 --> 4288.719
sweating under pressure trying to

4286.56 --> 4291.120000000001
counter this madness

4288.719 --> 4295.44
not because they're scared but because

4291.12 --> 4295.44
it's that strain strainful

4295.52 --> 4298.080000000001
sometimes

4298.88 --> 4303.12
because they won't stop they won't stop

4300.719 --> 4305.44
their act they won't stop upholding this

4303.12 --> 4305.44
image

4305.76 --> 4307.92
of

4307.04 --> 4309.6
yeah

4307.92 --> 4312.719
mind control

4309.6 --> 4315.04
drank the force we're trying to

4312.719 --> 4318.96
lure people into just

4315.04 --> 4318.96
surrendering their powers to them

4319.36 --> 4325.96
right it's just like ah give me your

4321.76 --> 4325.96
power or i give you a headache

4334.56 --> 4340.719
gas lighting definitely

4337.04 --> 4340.719
do i have cash app no

4340.96 --> 4345.76
right back i do not

4343.76 --> 4349.12
i don't think cash app even works

4345.76 --> 4349.12
outside the united states

4349.6 --> 4352.8
i think that uh

4353.76 --> 4360.64
good servant asked me about it before

4357.76 --> 4360.64
but it doesn't work

4361.12 --> 4366.5599999999995
only things that really work so far are

4363.199 --> 4366.5599999999995
paypal and patreon

4368.56 --> 4374.92
and there might be other ways to do it

4370.56 --> 4374.92
too i i don't know

4405.52 --> 4409.84
you could do paper that's awesome rig

4407.199 --> 4412.0
back thank you thank you very much for

4409.84 --> 4416.2390000000005
wanting to support me through that i

4412.0 --> 4416.239
really appreciate i can certainly use it

4425.28 --> 4429.12
right but anyway yeah that's what

4426.88 --> 4432.159000000001
they're doing

4429.12 --> 4435.599999999999
it's mind control

4432.159 --> 4438.719
corruption of your soul

4435.6 --> 4440.4800000000005
corruption of your thoughts

4438.719 --> 4442.88
yeah it is what it is

4440.48 --> 4446.159
so they're not actually dictators but

4442.88 --> 4448.0
they weave a spell like an organized

4446.159 --> 4451.12
system

4448.0 --> 4452.719
of lying it's organized lying

4451.12 --> 4455.44
in a very specific level they are

4452.719 --> 4458.32
conjuring a frequency of thinking

4455.44 --> 4460.799999999999
it's based on reversing things like just

4458.32 --> 4464.239
lying about it and then everybody agrees

4460.8 --> 4467.12
upon the lie within those that wield it

4464.239 --> 4470.32
and that's very compelling that is

4467.12 --> 4472.48
exerting a mind control effect

4470.32 --> 4474.32
some it gives a headache some just buy

4472.48 --> 4477.199
straight into it

4474.32 --> 4479.04
others may resist it

4477.199 --> 4481.28
but then

4479.04 --> 4483.12
yeah those that want to resist will have

4481.28 --> 4485.44
a hell of a lot of trouble trying to

4483.12 --> 4487.76
counter it because people that do that

4485.44 --> 4490.08
that engage in that spell that mind

4487.76 --> 4492.400000000001
control spell in the weave

4490.08 --> 4494.08
they don't listen

4492.4 --> 4495.839999999999
that's what the anti-flat earthers do

4494.08 --> 4498.88
they don't listen they never listen to

4495.84 --> 4502.08
what you say they basically dispel the

4498.88 --> 4504.400000000001
quality of your inquiry and responses by

4502.08 --> 4507.12
literally not hearing it

4504.4 --> 4508.96
already being having your mind to the

4507.12 --> 4510.8
next subject you want to move on to

4508.96 --> 4511.76
because you were never planning to

4510.8 --> 4513.679
listen

4511.76 --> 4514.64
when you engage in a mind control spell

4513.679 --> 4516.96
like that

4514.64 --> 4518.8
you just want to keep the story go you

4516.96 --> 4520.88
want to keep the spell going so you

4518.8 --> 4523.28
never really respond

4520.88 --> 4525.4400000000005
to actual inquiries

4523.28 --> 4527.679
you always move on you always gaslight

4525.44 --> 4529.678999999999
you always straw man

4527.679 --> 4531.4400000000005
right always just move on to the next

4529.679 --> 4534.0
thing always

4531.44 --> 4535.599999999999
that's what rompus did

4534.0 --> 4537.28
that's what the anti-flat earthers do

4535.6 --> 4539.280000000001
and that's what the politicians do i've

4537.28 --> 4543.04
even called it like two three years ago

4539.28 --> 4544.639999999999
like the similarities is just staggering

4543.04 --> 4547.44
and that was three years ago the

4544.64 --> 4549.4400000000005
similarities were staggering well now

4547.44 --> 4552.08
it's coming to a head

4549.44 --> 4554.48
the politicians are going full rompers

4552.08 --> 4556.32
mode they're like really putting it in

4554.48 --> 4558.32
now

4556.32 --> 4560.239
right they're literally putting their

4558.32 --> 4562.88
soul in the basket

4560.239 --> 4562.879999999999
doing this

4563.76 --> 4566.96
because

4564.88 --> 4568.159000000001
i think that once this breaks this

4566.96 --> 4570.159
effect

4568.159 --> 4572.0
with everything that they've done for it

4570.159 --> 4574.5599999999995
and sacrificed and they're

4572.0 --> 4576.96
been humiliated in ways and just went

4574.56 --> 4578.88
straight through it anyway

4576.96 --> 4580.96
when it snaps

4578.88 --> 4582.2390000000005
when that spell that mind control that

4580.96 --> 4585.04
collection

4582.239 --> 4587.839999999999
of agreements to uphold a certain level

4585.04 --> 4589.199
of lie in a consistent way when it snaps

4587.84 --> 4590.96
and that doesn't mean that people no

4589.199 --> 4593.12
longer believe it now when it actually

4590.96 --> 4594.96
snaps because it doesn't work anymore

4593.12 --> 4597.04
there's no more connection there's no

4594.96 --> 4598.96
more profit no more people actually

4597.04 --> 4600.88
falling for it

4598.96 --> 4603.36
the backlash

4600.88 --> 4605.84
and i'm talking about spiritual backlash

4603.36 --> 4609.839999999999
energy backlash

4605.84 --> 4611.84
it's like a spiritual whip

4609.84 --> 4613.84
because when they are then forced back

4611.84 --> 4615.679
into actual reality because they

4613.84 --> 4618.96
themselves get stuck in the reversed

4615.679 --> 4620.8
world doing that they all sit there

4618.96 --> 4622.96
in the reversed world and they believe

4620.8 --> 4624.159000000001
their [ __ ] just like rumpus believes his

4622.96 --> 4626.719
own [ __ ]

4624.159 --> 4629.599999999999
well when they then snap out of it

4626.719 --> 4631.679
they either go [ __ ] insane like stark

4629.6 --> 4633.6
raving mad

4631.679 --> 4635.04
or they become

4633.6 --> 4638.0
really

4635.04 --> 4640.08
painfully depressed and not like oh sad

4638.0 --> 4642.4
no like

4640.08 --> 4644.96
ultra hell pain

4642.4 --> 4646.879999999999
really deep on the inside you can't even

4644.96 --> 4649.12
express that

4646.88 --> 4653.28
right

4649.12 --> 4656.159
you can't even give expression to pain

4653.28 --> 4658.239
that comes out of the feedback

4656.159 --> 4659.36
from the spell breaking when that

4658.239 --> 4662.159
happens

4659.36 --> 4665.839999999999
so these people have all put their souls

4662.159 --> 4665.839999999999
in the basket doing this

4666.48 --> 4672.759999999999
and it's crazy

4668.239 --> 4672.759999999999
it's crazy that they did this

4717.52 --> 4721.84
ah all right rick back take it easy

4727.199 --> 4733.199
that's so funny by the way you're like

4730.96 --> 4735.44
you're not the first guy that's

4733.199 --> 4737.678999999999
like trying to send me paypal through

4735.44 --> 4739.28
their wife's paypal

4737.679 --> 4741.52
because they didn't have one themselves

4739.28 --> 4743.92
it's like oh your wife has every

4741.52 --> 4745.84
possible means of payment

4743.92 --> 4749.04
of course they're the money spenders

4745.84 --> 4750.4800000000005
right but you don't even have that

4749.04 --> 4752.48
it's

4750.48 --> 4756.28
typical

4752.48 --> 4756.28
you're not the first one

4770.159 --> 4774.48
it's probably also why paypal on their

4772.64 --> 4777.84
front page

4774.48 --> 4777.839999999999
usually has a woman on there

4780.88 --> 4784.4800000000005
when they have a picture of somebody

4785.84 --> 4788.84
anyway

4828.32 --> 4830.639
right

4830.84 --> 4835.04
anyway that was some weird predictions

4833.28 --> 4837.84
from my side

4835.04 --> 4840.0
so figuring out the magic and the magic

4837.84 --> 4841.92
effects like literally because there's a

4840.0 --> 4843.92
magic to mind control

4841.92 --> 4847.36
you're doing something you're

4843.92 --> 4849.6
well you're lying when you lie

4847.36 --> 4852.4
there's always a price

4849.6 --> 4854.400000000001
it lying does something to you does

4852.4 --> 4856.08
something to your perception and your

4854.4 --> 4860.08
soul

4856.08 --> 4862.08
so if you really put everything on a lie

4860.08 --> 4864.48
you're effectively putting your soul in

4862.08 --> 4867.04
the basket

4864.48 --> 4870.08
that's esoteric it's like

4867.04 --> 4871.84
basket of collection for example right

4870.08 --> 4873.6
you're putting everything in there

4871.84 --> 4876.639
everything you have

4873.6 --> 4876.639
that is you

4878.08 --> 4880.32
well

4880.56 --> 4884.92
you're gonna end up losing it

4892.159 --> 4896.96
because you can't

4894.8 --> 4901.360000000001
like you can

4896.96 --> 4902.4
pull people down with your lies you can

4901.36 --> 4904.719
make them

4902.4 --> 4906.719
dumber you can help them dumb themselves

4904.719 --> 4909.679
down

4906.719 --> 4912.4
you can make them fanatical followers

4909.679 --> 4914.159
like a priesthood of your lies of what

4912.4 --> 4917.839999999999
your agenda

4914.159 --> 4920.08
right but it's still it still lies and

4917.84 --> 4923.360000000001
the more time passes the more people

4920.08 --> 4926.08
will snap out of it they will have their

4923.36 --> 4927.759999999999
spiritual immune response

4926.08 --> 4930.639
and just like

4927.76 --> 4932.400000000001
this is this is all wrong they will snap

4930.639 --> 4934.56
out of it this is all wrong right and

4932.4 --> 4936.159
that number is only going to grow so

4934.56 --> 4937.679
eventually

4936.159 --> 4939.44
you're going to have that soul in the

4937.679 --> 4940.32
basket

4939.44 --> 4941.12
but

4940.32 --> 4943.199
then

4941.12 --> 4946.0
it's not worth anymore the investment

4943.199 --> 4948.159
you made originally everybody together

4946.0 --> 4949.679
with that big plan and the mind control

4948.159 --> 4952.08
and the exploitation

4949.679 --> 4956.4
suddenly it doesn't work anymore

4952.08 --> 4959.6
but you still gave it your soul you have

4956.4 --> 4963.12
effectively rearranged how you function

4959.6 --> 4965.4400000000005
based on the plan you've become the plan

4963.12 --> 4967.679
and when you become lies

4965.44 --> 4968.638999999999
you have to then believe them to keep it

4967.679 --> 4971.52
up

4968.639 --> 4972.56
but then you end up believing the lies

4971.52 --> 4975.1990000000005
and then

4972.56 --> 4977.76
when nobody else believes it you still

4975.199 --> 4980.879999999999
believe it and now

4977.76 --> 4982.88
you become trapped in a hell

4980.88 --> 4984.96
in hell and the only way you can get out

4982.88 --> 4988.159000000001
of that is by

4984.96 --> 4990.32
confronting yourself to the core

4988.159 --> 4992.719
so you got two options either you become

4990.32 --> 4994.96
stark raving mad being the only one

4992.719 --> 4998.2390000000005
believing your lies that is left and not

4994.96 --> 5001.04
being able to snap out of it or

4998.239 --> 5003.28
you basically face the pain of

5001.04 --> 5003.28
well

5003.36 --> 5007.92
everything you've done to a level that

5005.52 --> 5009.92
you've probably always avoided your

5007.92 --> 5011.92
entire life because

5009.92 --> 5015.28
nobody likes to confront pain and if

5011.92 --> 5017.84
you've lived kind of a cushy life

5015.28 --> 5020.239
you don't really need to confront that

5017.84 --> 5022.08
pain in order to progress

5020.239 --> 5023.839999999999
so that's going to be the most painful

5022.08 --> 5026.8
experience you ever

5023.84 --> 5026.8
experienced then

5027.36 --> 5031.159
with your cushy lives

5073.28 --> 5077.92
right but you guys can follow the model

5075.28 --> 5080.48
right what i'm trying to lay down how

5077.92 --> 5080.4800000000005
that works

5081.28 --> 5085.44
because don't underestimate it's like a

5082.96 --> 5087.44
politician

5085.44 --> 5089.759999999999
is like a spell weaver

5087.44 --> 5093.36
they uphold

5089.76 --> 5093.360000000001
organized spells

5093.6 --> 5098.2390000000005
that they agree upon but then

5096.639 --> 5100.639
they give it their everything then they

5098.239 --> 5102.959999999999
become that lie they start to believe it

5100.639 --> 5105.679
themselves it makes it more effective it

5102.96 --> 5107.679
makes their acting more natural

5105.679 --> 5110.2390000000005
but you also

5107.679 --> 5112.159
lose track of reality in the process and

5110.239 --> 5114.239
if you do that for too long then you

5112.159 --> 5116.5599999999995
become the lie

5114.239 --> 5117.839999999999
like you won't be able to get out of it

5116.56 --> 5120.400000000001
anymore

5117.84 --> 5122.159000000001
personally your psyche not like old

5120.4 --> 5123.92
judicially no

5122.159 --> 5126.96
if you really start to believe it to

5123.92 --> 5129.1990000000005
make your acting better and his lies

5126.96 --> 5132.2390000000005
part of it then eventually you will

5129.199 --> 5134.32
literally start to believe it

5132.239 --> 5136.239
and then you might not be able to snap

5134.32 --> 5138.719
out of that

5136.239 --> 5141.718999999999
you'll be insane clinically provably

5138.719 --> 5141.719
insane

5149.36 --> 5157.12
you can't expect a cluster b personality

5152.56 --> 5157.120000000001
disordered individual to understand that

5157.76 --> 5161.04
that's hilarious kevlar thank you for

5159.76 --> 5165.08
that

5161.04 --> 5165.08
but you're probably right

5206.32 --> 5211.44
right but i hope that my model that i

5209.12 --> 5215.28
just laid out of how this works

5211.44 --> 5217.04
that it really reflects for you on

5215.28 --> 5219.28
a lot right

5217.04 --> 5221.36
how many freaking politicians have we

5219.28 --> 5223.36
faced through television and all that

5221.36 --> 5224.88
over the years

5223.36 --> 5225.92
endless amounts

5224.88 --> 5227.76
so

5225.92 --> 5229.84
what i just explained

5227.76 --> 5233.04
i i claim

5229.84 --> 5234.400000000001
that it applies it applies to like all

5233.04 --> 5236.239
of them

5234.4 --> 5238.239
it's up to each individual like it's one

5236.239 --> 5240.718999999999
of those things you can look in there

5238.239 --> 5241.5199999999995
you can learn to look in their eyes and

5240.719 --> 5243.199
see

5241.52 --> 5245.52
how much they're invested in what

5243.199 --> 5247.28
they're actually doing how how much of

5245.52 --> 5248.56
their soul they've put in the basket

5247.28 --> 5251.44
right

5248.56 --> 5254.2390000000005
you can size that up by simply looking

5251.44 --> 5254.239
in their eyes

5254.32 --> 5259.199
i don't know

5255.92 --> 5260.159
how to teach that skill i can only tell

5259.199 --> 5262.719
you

5260.159 --> 5265.199
that that is something you can do

5262.719 --> 5267.84
it's something that i can do maybe you

5265.199 --> 5269.5199999999995
can learn to

5267.84 --> 5272.8
figure that out how that works the

5269.52 --> 5275.120000000001
balance of it when you size it up

5272.8 --> 5279.04
and maybe you can

5275.12 --> 5281.92
refine that skill just as much as i have

5279.04 --> 5283.84
so you can see like you can see all

5281.92 --> 5287.6
these things where the spirit and the

5283.84 --> 5290.2390000000005
soul is at just by looking in their eyes

5287.6 --> 5292.4800000000005
and it's not just oh my intuition oh a

5290.239 --> 5295.04
gut feeling no actually

5292.48 --> 5296.08
just like stats being able to size up

5295.04 --> 5298.32
something

5296.08 --> 5299.92
it's like this that that this is going

5298.32 --> 5301.92
to be the result

5299.92 --> 5304.159
right

5301.92 --> 5307.56
it's almost robotic

5304.159 --> 5307.5599999999995
but it works

5310.56 --> 5315.04
you could just see it

5312.159 --> 5317.839999999999
i don't know if like

5315.04 --> 5321.199
data analysis machines and computers can

5317.84 --> 5323.12
do it it might be a human-only skill

5321.199 --> 5325.5199999999995
it might be something only the spirit

5323.12 --> 5325.5199999999995
can do

5327.12 --> 5332.0
i'm not sure

5329.44 --> 5334.239
i mean there's a lot of like behavioral

5332.0 --> 5337.36
data analysis and

5334.239 --> 5340.638999999999
but that's different that's like none of

5337.36 --> 5343.12
those things actually directly apply to

5340.639 --> 5345.76
the model that i've just described which

5343.12 --> 5347.76
is more about internal workings

5345.76 --> 5351.320000000001
none of these

5347.76 --> 5351.320000000001
machine analysis

5351.36 --> 5356.639
of none of the data that concerns that

5354.56 --> 5359.84
behavioral

5356.639 --> 5362.8
attitude and like recognition systems

5359.84 --> 5365.6
none of them actually even address the

5362.8 --> 5367.52
real internal workings

5365.6 --> 5369.4400000000005
it's just trying to size up where

5367.52 --> 5371.120000000001
they're at

5369.44 --> 5375.0
a bit

5371.12 --> 5375.0
it's much more temporary

5379.199 --> 5381.839999999999
right anyway

5382.719 --> 5389.84
i hope you guys yeah that made you think

5385.76 --> 5389.84
it's something worth pondering you know

5390.48 --> 5396.239
they do things these politicians they do

5393.679 --> 5398.0
something for power so they will they

5396.239 --> 5399.839999999999
create a spell

5398.0 --> 5401.6
and they agree upon that spell everybody

5399.84 --> 5403.360000000001
agrees there it works

5401.6 --> 5407.84
it should work considering the

5403.36 --> 5407.839999999999
circumstance considering how people are

5408.32 --> 5412.48
and what what's going on

5410.48 --> 5414.48
and then you roll it out

5412.48 --> 5417.12
and then depending on

5414.48 --> 5420.4
how how well an actor you want to be at

5417.12 --> 5423.04
it how convincing you want to be there's

5420.4 --> 5425.44
certain levels of

5423.04 --> 5428.0
of investment of personal investment you

5425.44 --> 5430.799999999999
have to put in there how much are you

5428.0 --> 5432.96
going to put your soul in that basket to

5430.8 --> 5435.1990000000005
actually believe the lie as you're

5432.96 --> 5437.92
rolling it out so that others will look

5435.199 --> 5441.28
at you and see that you believe it

5437.92 --> 5444.56
and then they might believe it too

5441.28 --> 5447.5599999999995
it's a trick it works but there's a big

5444.56 --> 5447.56
price

5451.6 --> 5455.84
because yeah you put your soul in the

5453.679 --> 5458.4800000000005
basket

5455.84 --> 5460.8
and people that at first just trust you

5458.48 --> 5463.5199999999995
and believe you they will eventually

5460.8 --> 5467.92
figure out that you're a madman

5463.52 --> 5467.92
hopefully for them sometimes they don't

5469.52 --> 5473.2390000000005
but some will

5477.36 --> 5481.759999999999
all right

5479.36 --> 5481.759999999999

5711.04 --> 5716.32
ah it's nice weather in the uk too good

5713.92 --> 5716.32
to hear

5716.88 --> 5719.4400000000005
yeah we could use some good weather you

5718.4 --> 5721.28
know

5719.44 --> 5724.48
i know it's still quite a while till

5721.28 --> 5726.84
springtime but yeah i really can't wait

5724.48 --> 5728.5599999999995
until it gets back i'm like

5726.84 --> 5731.84
yeah

5728.56 --> 5731.84
being impatient again

5734.88 --> 5738.0
but

5736.0 --> 5740.48
yeah and winter hasn't been even that

5738.0 --> 5742.88
terrible you know here i mean yeah in

5740.48 --> 5744.239
other regions like the us just all that

5742.88 --> 5746.96
snow

5744.239 --> 5748.718999999999
yeah that's pretty heavy winter

5746.96 --> 5752.8
so i can imagine that over there you

5748.719 --> 5754.2390000000005
even want the springtime back even more

5752.8 --> 5756.320000000001
right

5754.239 --> 5758.0
but yeah i hope i've always loved

5756.32 --> 5759.92
springtime over here

5758.0 --> 5763.8
all the trees start blooming and all

5759.92 --> 5763.8
that i just love it

5776.719 --> 5783.04
are you going to do any jogging

5780.4 --> 5785.5199999999995
three mornings a week all right

5783.04 --> 5787.28
there's a lot of people jogging like i

5785.52 --> 5789.360000000001
see people jogging

5787.28 --> 5791.36
past all the time

5789.36 --> 5792.96
i think it's a very popular jogging

5791.36 --> 5794.5599999999995
route

5792.96 --> 5797.679
it should be it's a really beautiful

5794.56 --> 5800.8
area next to the water

5797.679 --> 5802.719
so if i were into that i'd do that over

5800.8 --> 5804.320000000001
here too

5802.719 --> 5805.92
but i'm not gonna do that unless there's

5804.32 --> 5809.759999999999
like a really hot chick i'm doing it

5805.92 --> 5813.84
with that's just the way it is

5809.76 --> 5813.84
otherwise i'm just not doing it

5821.44 --> 5826.239
don't do a lot of logging

5823.92 --> 5830.0
well i bet you're laying down a log

5826.239 --> 5830.0
every day just like everybody else

5838.88 --> 5843.52
yeah so i don't know i'm just calling

5840.96 --> 5845.84
you lydia logs

5843.52 --> 5848.56
but it's also i don't know why

5845.84 --> 5850.8
but it's not even like a log like that

5848.56 --> 5853.04
it's like a log book i just thought that

5850.8 --> 5855.28
lydia logs like you have

5853.04 --> 5856.159
you're a girl and you have like a log

5855.28 --> 5858.48
book

5856.159 --> 5860.239
online or something that's what

5858.48 --> 5862.48
what i hear in my mind when i call you

5860.239 --> 5864.0
lydia logs really

5862.48 --> 5866.4
don't worry i'm just no i'm not

5864.0 --> 5869.84
constantly thinking of you like a turd

5866.4 --> 5869.839999999999
or anything don't worry about that

5869.92 --> 5876.56
but when you annoy me a bit then i will

5872.8 --> 5876.56
think about it like that for a moment

5881.679 --> 5885.6
all right so i'm rounding out

5886.48 --> 5891.199
thanks everyone for coming

5888.48 --> 5892.4
i hope you like this show if you don't

you can't even see how

5897.199 --> 5900.4

aren't you guys

5900.4 --> 5904.638999999999

5902.239 --> 5907.36
hundred down votes

5904.639 --> 5910.32

5907.36 --> 5913.36
i do miss it a bit

5910.32 --> 5915.44
i never asked to have it turn off i mean

5913.36 --> 5917.44
you can literally turn it off if you

5915.44 --> 5919.119

5917.44 --> 5922.48
be turned off
