good servant

152.959 --> 155.62
avi Kim

161.36 --> 169.65
right

163.349 --> 170.209
yeah Walker Walker a 78 good to see you

169.65 --> 176.93
all

170.209 --> 176.93
yeah it's a lovely day today I feel very

177.14 --> 185.79
laid back and compared to yesterday I

180.18 --> 188.76000000000002
know maybe it was weird like I was I had

185.79 --> 190.56
no drinks yesterday of course I was even

188.76 --> 195.29899999999998
like sober on the ball busters and all

190.56 --> 198.689
that but yeah I don't know I was just

195.299 --> 201.09
very active pretty much all night so I

198.689 --> 205.409
stayed up actually really late for my

201.09 --> 207.989
doing like 4 o'clock so yeah I've been

205.409 --> 215.38899999999998
kind of sleeping late on a Sunday not

207.989 --> 218.22
too late and what was I doing

215.389 --> 221.31
I've been watching a lot more of that

218.22 --> 223.98
series The Good Witch and also talking

221.31 --> 226.56
about it with my dad for a bit basically

223.98 --> 230.17999999999998
telling him yeah that lady kind of

226.56 --> 232.47
reminds me a bit of yeah your wife and

230.18 --> 233.519
that made him a bit curious oh he's

232.47 --> 240.03
gonna check it out

233.519 --> 244.139
and more introspective stuff basically

240.03 --> 247.47
presenting him with well he we already

244.139 --> 251.31
talked about this for like years about

247.47 --> 255.87
how my intelligence has become like a

251.31 --> 258.63
real perfectionist in basically making

255.87 --> 261.23900000000003
excuses well that's already a negative

258.63 --> 269.01
connotation but rather just giving like

261.239 --> 270.92999999999995
very good reasons for whatever but

269.01 --> 273.71999999999997
including for not doing things like

270.93 --> 276.24
giving this extremely strategical plan

273.72 --> 278.46000000000004
for not doing certain things and reasons

276.24 --> 280.38
and all that the problem is is that that

278.46 --> 285.25899999999996
mechanism has become so good and so

280.38 --> 288.419
automated that it kind of surpasses a

285.259 --> 291.57
more normal consideration of these

288.419 --> 295.12
things it bypasses my feelings because

291.57 --> 299.34999999999997
my feelings are in general very

295.12 --> 302.639
nervous even to upset levels for trying

299.35 --> 306.49
new things like really especially

302.639 --> 309.04
getting out and just yeah

306.49 --> 310.87
meeting new people which is absolutely

309.04 --> 314.29
involved in for example getting a job

310.87 --> 319.479
like that so I just talked it through

314.29 --> 321.46000000000004
with him and like basically laid out the

319.479 --> 323.43
yeah the thing that I've put down here

321.46 --> 326.83
on my show in the last few weeks

323.43 --> 331.51
like condensing it and now condensing it

326.83 --> 333.789
with this and I'm also it's funny that I

331.51 --> 338.94
hope remember that whole thing the

333.789 --> 342.49
condensing like compacting forcing your

338.94 --> 345.52
consciousness to be where you are at and

342.49 --> 351.46000000000004
what needs to be done now and all that

345.52 --> 354.49
and I think that that spectrum of

351.46 --> 356.08
approaching people and how they respond

354.49 --> 358.33
to things it's it's kind of an

356.08 --> 361.15
interesting self standing system a

358.33 --> 365.56
spectrum that you can literally compare

361.15 --> 369.58
with everyone in their own ways and it's

365.56 --> 372.13
not it should not be morally judgmental

369.58 --> 374.139
in any way because the context is

372.13 --> 378.88
different every time it it's just a

374.139 --> 382.81
mechanism mechanism state of being as it

378.88 --> 385.36
were and yeah it's a mechanism that most

382.81 --> 392.169
people don't really focus on what it is

385.36 --> 397.93
there and yeah letting that concept sink

392.169 --> 401.139
in and see how viable it will be for me

397.93 --> 407.05
in the future to use this as a as a tool

401.139 --> 410.13
to size up how people do things beside

407.05 --> 412.90000000000003
everything else it's just another tool

410.13 --> 415.81
psychological tool for me and yeah it's

412.9 --> 417.51
it's interesting just the realization

415.81 --> 421.389
that's something that I've pretty much

417.51 --> 424.59
spontaneously realized could have

421.389 --> 424.59000000000003
long-term value like that

425.33 --> 431.28
and maybe also I literally need like

428.76 --> 434.52
these calm days these moments where I'm

431.28 --> 436.65
just laid-back to even become calm

434.52 --> 440.54999999999995
enough to see this sort of thing like

436.65 --> 444.9
yeah it's really good hmm because when

440.55 --> 449.37
I'm a restless I tend to hand-wave

444.9 --> 453.0
dismiss pun attended the value of things

449.37 --> 457.14
sort of think that I come up with and I

453.0 --> 459.66
think also that but this is it's it's

457.14 --> 460.91999999999996
tough to size up this thing but I think

459.66 --> 462.84000000000003
that it might also be slightly

460.92 --> 468.36
intimidating to some people and they

462.84 --> 470.52
don't like to show it to me but they

468.36 --> 473.85
might overlook that I literally don't

470.52 --> 477.97999999999996
even recognize it that much consciously

473.85 --> 480.24
it's and that makes it a weird chemistry

477.98 --> 483.54
because that way it's not addressed it

480.24 --> 485.73
still comes forth I'd absolutely don't

483.54 --> 488.27000000000004
try to brag with it you know the only

485.73 --> 490.77000000000004
times I really brag at this point is is

488.27 --> 494.31
literally like I have to promote myself

490.77 --> 497.28
I have to do that because I don't like

494.31 --> 500.46
to brag it makes me feel kind of dirty

497.28 --> 506.29999999999995
I guess I'm that I've become that much

500.46 --> 506.29999999999995
of a purism feels like a luxury i it's

507.2 --> 515.76
yeah it doesn't do too much good and it

512.82 --> 517.6800000000001
attracts a frequency and people that

515.76 --> 522.6
come with that frequency that'll bring

517.68 --> 524.2199999999999
more trouble of actually getting away

522.6 --> 527.16
with it because people that get like

524.22 --> 530.3100000000001
that they get encouraged by other people

527.16 --> 533.0699999999999
that do it like that as well that's

530.31 --> 534.5699999999999
hence tends to happen social situation I

533.07 --> 536.0100000000001
don't like that at all

534.57 --> 539.0400000000001
I don't like to get dragged into that

536.01 --> 543.11
into arrogance and I like showing off

539.04 --> 545.8499999999999
how freaking arrogant you are look I

543.11 --> 548.12
used to like that that's the problem

545.85 --> 551.78
I kind of used to like that's very petty

548.12 --> 551.78
it's very petty

552.32 --> 558.769
but in that moment yeah I didn't really

555.38 --> 561.98
give a [ __ ] last at times because I was

558.769 --> 564.17
just I allowed that because I was pissed

561.98 --> 565.88
off at the world and then it's like her

564.17 --> 568.04
well if the world's not going to be the

565.88 --> 570.529
way I want then I'll do it like this

568.04 --> 574.2199999999999
it's very childish in a way but I think

570.529 --> 576.5889999999999
that's automatically what a lot of

574.22 --> 579.9200000000001
people do especially like in their teens

576.589 --> 583.5500000000001
they start to realize things about the

579.92 --> 584.899
world and they realize yeah that's

583.55 --> 586.88
absolutely not

584.899 --> 589.069
what I had hoped for it's exactly the

586.88 --> 593.389
opposite in ways because young dreams

589.069 --> 597.05
and and then they can have these kind of

593.389 --> 599.36
responses like no okay if you're gonna

597.05 --> 601.16
do it that way they basically pick a

599.36 --> 603.98
fight with the world

601.16 --> 605.6
like the entire world like as if they

603.98 --> 612.589
would pick a fight with their parents

605.6 --> 617.1800000000001
for resisting you know but when you're

612.589 --> 620.839
that young you don't yet realize how how

617.18 --> 622.88
big of a battle if you really want to do

620.839 --> 624.769
that for real how big of a battle that

622.88 --> 627.769
is and that's also why a lot of

624.769 --> 629.99
teenagers and this is very very creepy

627.769 --> 632.199
for me in a way when I started to

629.99 --> 635.12
realize this which was pretty young on

632.199 --> 637.16
that a lot of people have this struggle

635.12 --> 642.339
with the world that they don't like

637.16 --> 642.3389999999999
things about it and then they give up

642.91 --> 649.79
it's yeah and how do they give up you

647.029 --> 654.529
know sometimes they give up and then

649.79 --> 658.25
they they don't necessarily give up the

654.529 --> 659.93
struggle and then stay vigilant now

658.25 --> 662.72
sometimes they give up and then they

659.93 --> 664.7299999999999
kind of surrender to it and they they

662.72 --> 666.8290000000001
basically merge with that thing that

664.73 --> 669.6800000000001
they tried to fight the thing has

666.829 --> 672.0999999999999
conquered them effectively and people

669.68 --> 674.75
don't even consciously realize this

672.1 --> 678.35
often about one another they might get a

674.75 --> 679.67
feeling that they may see like behaviors

678.35 --> 681.1990000000001
that weren't there before that they're

679.67 --> 684.2299999999999
like feel corrupted and you don't

681.199 --> 685.9699999999999
understand why but it is because they

684.23 --> 692.36
lost their strong

685.97 --> 696.08
with the world in a very bad way and

692.36 --> 698.27
that can be yeah people will simply see

696.08 --> 701.39
with these people like wow they stopped

698.27 --> 704.06
being so rebellious in a way now they're

701.39 --> 708.02
like oh they're perfectly going along

704.06 --> 714.17
they adapted so well but at what price

708.02 --> 725.99
effectively people don't see that people

714.17 --> 728.6899999999999
don't see what the real price but I did

725.99 --> 731.21
see it I did see it happen to a lot of

728.69 --> 733.6600000000001
people when I was in school I literally

731.21 --> 737.39
studied every single people that I could

733.66 --> 742.16
member their faces I just studied them I

737.39 --> 744.29
had to understand like how are they what

742.16 --> 746.8299999999999
are they going through like I wanted to

744.29 --> 749.51
know so much more about everyone that

746.83 --> 751.0400000000001
teenager is willing to share you know

749.51 --> 754.04
there are like huh

751.04 --> 757.04
no that's secret like of course of

754.04 --> 759.3499999999999
course but I had to freaking know I had

757.04 --> 761.2099999999999
to know it for me not to get some power

759.35 --> 764.48
of I had to know what to fricking

761.21 --> 768.38
understand and some people did obliged

764.48 --> 770.57
to that and then there is another issue

768.38 --> 772.61
with it and but this I overcame this

770.57 --> 775.7
over time and that is like confidence

772.61 --> 777.98
and trust because the problem was when I

775.7 --> 780.08
was young I was kind of doing similar

777.98 --> 782.72
things to like what I do now here even

780.08 --> 787.9100000000001
on the show but among people not on

782.72 --> 790.5500000000001
streaming life and people would confide

787.91 --> 792.26
in me share the intricate details that I

790.55 --> 795.74
wanted to know but the problem was

792.26 --> 799.79
sometimes what was revealed to me

795.74 --> 801.92
through that would be so heavy or not

799.79 --> 806.03
negatively but just overwhelming like

801.92 --> 808.37
wow that sometimes that would make me

806.03 --> 811.13
lose track of like weight but it was

808.37 --> 814.37
really private and then I'd like have to

811.13 --> 818.67
talk about it but I didn't have that

814.37 --> 821.16
kind of a bond with my parents too well

818.67 --> 823.3499999999999
and then sometimes I would get lured

821.16 --> 824.9699999999999
like a lady had to spill my guts Oh

823.35 --> 828.09
mister people that were like even in

824.97 --> 831.48
school and then I would spill secrets it

828.09 --> 836.13
was a terrible thing that I did I was

831.48 --> 838.5600000000001
like a black ler and oh my god just so

836.13 --> 841.29
ashamed of that and like I was shamed

838.56 --> 844.4399999999999
for that and I was like [ __ ] what

841.29 --> 848.42
happened you know [ __ ] that is so bad

844.44 --> 851.6
like now people won't trust me anymore

848.42 --> 854.64
like I will have to be like really

851.6 --> 857.4
showing that I will never do that again

854.64 --> 860.25
like show how serious that is

857.4 --> 865.23
and still some people will never trust

860.25 --> 869.58
me there again when it really was an

865.23 --> 872.25
accident like I that it's just that

869.58 --> 874.86
every time something happened what I

872.25 --> 879.75
would see in those things happening in

874.86 --> 882.1800000000001
situation would be so yeah it would I

879.75 --> 885.03
would get so fascinated with it that I

882.18 --> 887.5999999999999
would lose track of the social context

885.03 --> 890.52
of myself within it I would become like

887.6 --> 892.35
obsessed with the overseer position to

890.52 --> 894.99
try and figure out what's going on not

892.35 --> 898.32
realizing that I am also a person within

894.99 --> 901.86
that situation that has this that has

898.32 --> 905.13
social relations to uphold and that was

901.86 --> 907.23
a big problem for me it's it's sometimes

905.13 --> 910.65
still is but I'm just much more aware of

907.23 --> 913.77
it and I literally had to punish myself

910.65 --> 917.25
to kind of draw me out of that beautiful

913.77 --> 919.47
cloud of oversight it is partially also

917.25 --> 923.37
why I had this weird habit of getting

919.47 --> 926.4
really insidiously angry at myself

923.37 --> 930.0
it is divorce be like get from that

926.4 --> 931.35
freakin cloud like get back in my body

930.0 --> 934.429
now

931.35 --> 934.429
[Music]

942.869 --> 955.899
mm all right yeah talking a lot

950.499 --> 957.339
psychology group psychology I can talk

955.899 --> 960.73
some flatter with no problem

957.339 --> 964.899
you know it's Sunday I can do a long

960.73 --> 968.7090000000001
show yesterday was over two hours it was

964.899 --> 971.769
pretty long for a Saturday but these

968.709 --> 974.3499999999999
days in the weekends I have kind of

971.769 --> 978.279
standard plan to do at least one and a

974.35 --> 980.649
half hour show I rarely do it less than

978.279 --> 983.139
that unless I have specific plant time

980.649 --> 985.629
based plants and I can make a show that

983.139 --> 988.99
long but yeah I've been doing like why

985.629 --> 993.79
don't half our shows at least in the

988.99 --> 995.98
weekends for months now half a year I

993.79 --> 997.809
think I will keep that up so you can

995.98 --> 1002.939
always count on me to have at least one

997.809 --> 1006.929
half-hour show in the weekend then we

1002.939 --> 1009.29
can talk about whatever I feel pretty

1006.929 --> 1009.29
laid-back

1015.89 --> 1018.96
[Music]

1022.75 --> 1025.83
[Music]

1031.36 --> 1046.53
uh right hold on losing focus here

1053.12 --> 1066.9799999999998
I was kind of done with my retrospect

1056.059 --> 1068.78
reflection yeah by the way I don't know

1066.98 --> 1072.17
for sure yet but there might be a

1068.78 --> 1074.45
another detriment financially coming at

1072.17 --> 1077.39
it the problem is I don't even know if

1074.45 --> 1080.059
you guys if what this going on here can

1077.39 --> 1084.0400000000002
offset this as I said I might be

1080.059 --> 1087.4289999999999
reaching a serious impasse because I

1084.04 --> 1090.3799999999999
think I have to like my dad I

1087.429 --> 1093.0400000000002
he hasn't been absolutely clear about it

1090.38 --> 1095.48
but my dad basically said that he can

1093.04 --> 1098.0
handle my storage anymore and it's like

1095.48 --> 1100.1
being transferred but yeah I where am I

1098.0 --> 1106.16
gonna get those four extra finances each

1100.1 --> 1107.6599999999999
month it's quite a lot and I I don't

1106.16 --> 1112.3700000000001
really know what to do about this

1107.66 --> 1114.71
situation I to be frank I don't even

1112.37 --> 1117.8899999999999
understand how I used to be able to pay

1114.71 --> 1120.98
for that stuff before I don't know how I

1117.89 --> 1125.5700000000002
did that I just remembered that it was

1120.98 --> 1129.41
really stressed out a lot of the time so

1125.57 --> 1131.36
I don't know it worries me but at the

1129.41 --> 1133.25
same time I'm kind of like forcing

1131.36 --> 1135.55
myself to just trust that things will be

1133.25 --> 1135.55
all right

1144.15 --> 1151.27
yeah yeah nobody has to tell me what

1147.43 --> 1154.45
ever to do alright

1151.27 --> 1157.6
but yeah that that has been on my on my

1154.45 --> 1163.63
list and and potential consequences that

1157.6 --> 1166.0
come with it if yeah if I'd be

1163.63 --> 1168.22
absolutely forced to literally get some

1166.0 --> 1172.38
kind of job just to be able to not be

1168.22 --> 1176.29
forced to throw stuff on the street

1172.38 --> 1182.0800000000002
right well if that will happen then yeah

1176.29 --> 1184.0
I see very little choice as with with

1182.08 --> 1189.79
the show like I would have to

1184.0 --> 1193.99
discontinue it and yeah until further

1189.79 --> 1200.29
notice but I write I haven't I haven't

1193.99 --> 1202.36
really started searching yet I'm trying

1200.29 --> 1206.23
to figure out just yet like where would

1202.36 --> 1208.6899999999998
I go what what would be a viable

1206.23 --> 1212.65
direction for me to do that that could

1208.69 --> 1218.52
really work that would not end me up in

1212.65 --> 1218.52
a complete [ __ ] psychologically I

1219.45 --> 1225.3700000000001
wonder if if basically a job at a store

1222.97 --> 1231.3
or something would do it but I don't

1225.37 --> 1237.1299999999999
know I'm not exactly yeah proto store

1231.3 --> 1239.02
material as in I'm not but maybe it

1237.13 --> 1244.99
would I guess it would depend on the

1239.02 --> 1250.09
store owners like whatever they like but

1244.99 --> 1252.76
I don't know a lot of store I'm not like

1250.09 --> 1255.48
a typical shopping type that checks out

1252.76 --> 1255.48
every store

1260.62 --> 1265.4299999999998
but anyway for now I'm just gonna see

1263.33 --> 1269.3899999999999
how things work out and definitely

1265.43 --> 1277.22
continue with the show try to put down

1269.39 --> 1287.0600000000002
as much good stuff as I can and then ya

1277.22 --> 1294.3500000000001
figure it out somehow like hopefully the

1287.06 --> 1297.95
the whole GTI system with crypto I hope

1294.35 --> 1302.75
it's somehow because it should max like

1297.95 --> 1305.96
the the Savings Plans sort of the saving

1302.75 --> 1308.0
points plan involved in that that's

1305.96 --> 1311.78
gonna max out like in this summer it's

1308.0 --> 1314.15
gonna be very quick to max out that mean

1311.78 --> 1318.56
that I'm gonna have like like the

1314.15 --> 1321.68
standard cryptocurrency output but it's

1318.56 --> 1325.3899999999999
still very tough it's not that much and

1321.68 --> 1328.91
yeah the crypto market is like very

1325.39 --> 1330.98
complicated to me at this point but it

1328.91 --> 1336.5600000000002
is like a beginning part but I don't

1330.98 --> 1339.71
even know if it's enough to yeah to pay

1336.56 --> 1342.56
for like the storage or something the

1339.71 --> 1344.42
problem was before is that it used to be

1342.56 --> 1348.08
very much enough because my dad is

1344.42 --> 1349.97
fading way farther than I am in his

1348.08 --> 1353.36
output he's already maxed out for a

1349.97 --> 1355.06
while and he's yeah he's been crushing

1353.36 --> 1359.27
it with that a lot is it like really

1355.06 --> 1361.19
professional into the company and he

1359.27 --> 1363.02
used to be able to pay for that from the

1361.19 --> 1366.89
surpluses but because everything has

1363.02 --> 1369.71
been rearranged suddenly you can't do

1366.89 --> 1371.8400000000001
that anymore like even the value of a

1369.71 --> 1373.7
lot of it has been severely downgraded

1371.84 --> 1377.6599999999999
at some point and now they're trying to

1373.7 --> 1379.82
offset that downgrade again would by

1377.66 --> 1385.3100000000002
rearranging things in a more optimal way

1379.82 --> 1387.3999999999999
it's all about the growth really it's

1385.31 --> 1391.21
been quite surreal

1387.4 --> 1395.71
and yeah that's been kind of the problem

1391.21 --> 1399.07
is that he wasn't able to use the

1395.71 --> 1402.19
surplus from that to pay for the storage

1399.07 --> 1405.28
that will also store some of his stuff

1402.19 --> 1408.76
by the way so it wasn't just paying for

1405.28 --> 1416.71
me but yeah now that's all changed and

1408.76 --> 1418.66
it's like great yeah I kind of feel

1416.71 --> 1421.929
really shitty about that really this

1418.66 --> 1425.38
every time freakin storage situations

1421.929 --> 1431.14
come afloat I get really really stressed

1425.38 --> 1433.41
out and I'm surprised I'm so calm under

1431.14 --> 1433.41
this

1440.63 --> 1445.9
work back from the goal the bralette go

1444.26 --> 1453.68
I don't understand what you mean exactly

1445.9 --> 1457.67
Robin Stanley all right yeah the issue

1453.68 --> 1459.5
is for me is I simply don't have the

1457.67 --> 1462.5500000000002
freaking space for all that stuff

1459.5 --> 1470.63
including like a really decent bed

1462.55 --> 1473.36
that's pretty awesome right and I

1470.63 --> 1478.0400000000002
already pretty much threw away so many

1473.36 --> 1482.75
furniture things that yeah there's now

1478.04 --> 1484.82
one-third left there's some stuff also I

1482.75 --> 1489.56
basically pretty much gave them to my

1484.82 --> 1494.21
dad because he can use it also to get it

1489.56 --> 1496.79
away from storage like I've literally

1494.21 --> 1500.66
considered just giving away everything

1496.79 --> 1505.3899999999999
in there like almost everything because

1500.66 --> 1509.6000000000001
I just it's such a you it's been such a

1505.39 --> 1511.5500000000002
massive massive burden on me just the

1509.6 --> 1514.9699999999998
thing that it is constantly they're

1511.55 --> 1517.19
sitting not that I can't use it and that

1514.97 --> 1520.04
I that it costs money it cost effort

1517.19 --> 1524.47
costs me stress but I just it's

1520.04 --> 1524.47
completely insane to just throw it away

1537.28 --> 1544.54
all righty how do I find it good

1540.25 --> 1547.78
well how about hey I don't want to die a

1544.54 --> 1550.6299999999999
freakin poverty how about that acaba is

1547.78 --> 1556.81
that okay with you I want to [ __ ]

1550.63 --> 1561.66
live right how about that or would you

1556.81 --> 1565.4199999999998
like to offset that with extra donation

1561.66 --> 1569.0800000000002
you know you think I like it you think I

1565.42 --> 1574.65
like even using money yeah you know I'd

1569.08 --> 1577.4199999999998
like to be able to have some things

1574.65 --> 1579.52
Bitcoin is I'm not even it's not Bitcoin

1577.42 --> 1582.25
what do you think Bitcoin is the only

1579.52 --> 1588.67
crypto out there no this has nothing to

1582.25 --> 1591.1
do with Bitcoin unfortunately though if

1588.67 --> 1595.78
you ever want to transfer any kind of

1591.1 --> 1598.48
money if you want to exchange any kind

1595.78 --> 1600.73
of crypto into actual money that you can

1598.48 --> 1603.69
spend then a lot of the times yeah you

1600.73 --> 1611.5
will have to trade it into Bitcoin

1603.69 --> 1613.77
that's kind of annoying and it's not all

1611.5 --> 1613.77
good

1617.95 --> 1625.56
like what out there is all good you can

1621.52 --> 1625.56
point me at edit that will be great

1629.61 --> 1637.84
right you have it well it is it is super

1632.71 --> 1639.55
shady it is shady and it gives me the

1637.84 --> 1643.2099999999998
feel like yeah I'm playing the game they

1639.55 --> 1646.99
could just don't just all gone just like

1643.21 --> 1651.42
that and no accountability I don't know

1646.99 --> 1658.26
the problem is is that I kind of wanna I

1651.42 --> 1662.01
need money it's as simple as that and

1658.26 --> 1669.31
it's cost me very little effort so far

1662.01 --> 1674.53
in comparison although my dad has

1669.31 --> 1677.55
invested a lot of effort and yeah I

1674.53 --> 1677.55
don't like it either

1678.9 --> 1682.98
but yeah well what's the alternative

1687.61 --> 1694.25
like if you know anything else out there

1690.08 --> 1697.21
that's like really easy to get some

1694.25 --> 1700.33
finances together then please tell me

1697.21 --> 1700.33
you know

1708.35 --> 1711.1299999999999
all right

1718.24 --> 1721.96
okay Lee Redpath

1795.83 --> 1805.23
grow weed oh that would be lovely

1800.6 --> 1811.32
unfortunately it's not really legal to

1805.23 --> 1813.3600000000001
like do it professionally and yeah but

1811.32 --> 1817.74
because the idea has been there for a

1813.36 --> 1820.6789999999999
long time but it's yeah like I don't

1817.74 --> 1822.57
want anything on my record like I have

1820.679 --> 1825.049
absolutely clean record and I want to

1822.57 --> 1825.049
keep it that way

1835.99 --> 1840.81
yeah the competition is going to be very

1838.39 --> 1840.8100000000002
stiff

1853.67 --> 1859.25
but yeah anyway I'm not gonna do that

1857.92 --> 1862.95
[Music]

1859.25 --> 1866.46
for me the big key is to somehow find a

1862.95 --> 1869.1000000000001
freaking entry to society and the

1866.46 --> 1872.22
biggest problem is not so much even to

1869.1 --> 1877.28
find the entry but to find for myself a

1872.22 --> 1882.17
viable way to entangle with it without

1877.28 --> 1882.17
basically aggravating myself to death

1891.97 --> 1898.6200000000001
because in a way like yeah I think that

1896.29 --> 1901.3
I've become kind of a I don't know a

1898.62 --> 1906.8999999999999
well-known personality at least among

1901.3 --> 1906.8999999999999
flat earth circles in my own way

1907.47 --> 1913.03
it's not like I'm constantly the talk of

1910.3 --> 1917.37
the day this ITR do you in the wind army

1913.03 --> 1921.31
and all that in chats but general and

1917.37 --> 1925.6799999999998
well if I can do that here then maybe in

1921.31 --> 1925.6799999999998
some way I can do it out there as well

1929.25 --> 1937.14
hey who knows you know batch batch look

1932.71 --> 1942.64
that's the thing once I find a financial

1937.14 --> 1948.15
threshold where suddenly I get like real

1942.64 --> 1951.7
surpluses like when I can actually just

1948.15 --> 1956.22
no longer worry about constantly [ __ ]

1951.7 --> 1959.0800000000002
just being ripped away from me there is

1956.22 --> 1962.71
so many things I could potentially do

1959.08 --> 1965.5
it's insane and back in the past such

1962.71 --> 1968.29
situations were to haunt me sounds

1965.5 --> 1974.38
really silly because too many options

1968.29 --> 1976.24
for me is like it was sometimes so tough

1974.38 --> 1978.97
that I would choose nothing yeah it's

1976.24 --> 1983.19
completely counterproductive that had

1978.97 --> 1987.28
been a problem well not anymore

1983.19 --> 1991.99
that at that element I've broken I've

1987.28 --> 1994.6499999999999
broken that like too many options is an

1991.99 --> 1994.65
illusion

1997.46 --> 2008.23
and I I know that now so yeah I could do

2005.169 --> 2010.659
all kinds of things in all directions it

2008.23 --> 2014.789
all depends really on like the financial

2010.659 --> 2018.73
I have to understand finances for real

2014.789 --> 2021.57
for that I just need to get to a point

2018.73 --> 2025.299
where first it's it's really stable and

2021.57 --> 2028.149
I get some surplus like hey a normal

2025.299 --> 2032.26
freakin human being how about that you

2028.149 --> 2034.6
know and when I get there I'll have to

2032.26 --> 2039.429
figure it out again and see if I can

2034.6 --> 2041.23
finally conduct myself with these things

2039.429 --> 2047.71
in a more adult way instead of a

2041.23 --> 2050.08
panicking teenager yeah so and I think I

2047.71 --> 2052.659
can do it I just have to get there first

2050.08 --> 2056.379
maybe in a way it's like yeah I've been

2052.659 --> 2058.149
under so much freaking poverty pressure

2056.379 --> 2060.3689999999997
you could call it even though probably

2058.149 --> 2062.649
is on average it's not really poverty

2060.369 --> 2065.08
but it's freaking feels like it and I've

2062.649 --> 2067.359
been in that for so long that I maybe

2065.08 --> 2071.74
it's literally just a conditioning

2067.359 --> 2076.119
process that I just need to feel that

2071.74 --> 2078.7299999999996
spiritual torture just the focus myself

2076.119 --> 2083.6690000000003
to be able to deal with it like a normal

2078.73 --> 2083.669
person maybe it's that ridiculous

2084.33 --> 2093.48
because I want to I want to be freaking

2087.669 --> 2096.8199999999997
competent I really want it so bad so bad

2093.48 --> 2099.52
it's just that could never find the way

2096.82 --> 2102.79
through things would always get in the

2099.52 --> 2104.8
way and then really get in way like not

2102.79 --> 2106.75
just oh it's blocked what I have to

2104.8 --> 2109.7200000000003
fight with no it would something would

2106.75 --> 2113.17
get in the way and I would topple really

2109.72 --> 2114.25
all the way down bang everything all the

2113.17 --> 2117.4900000000002
grip would be lost

2114.25 --> 2122.95
that's the type of [ __ ] that would

2117.49 --> 2126.4599999999996
happen like soon said like I lost the

2122.95 --> 2130.5499999999997
flow I wouldn't just like pause now I

2126.46 --> 2133.01
would break that's been a huge problem

2130.55 --> 2137.4500000000003
and that's all all the people that saw

2133.01 --> 2140.0800000000004
that just thought that's a liability not

2137.45 --> 2145.6899999999996
on purpose but it's like he's unstable

2140.08 --> 2149.48
it's not somebody we can lean on well

2145.69 --> 2152.0
yeah when I started to figure that out

2149.48 --> 2154.52
that I had that as a curse

2152.0 --> 2159.05
I really cannot call it anything else

2154.52 --> 2160.7
that occurs I realized that is okay I'm

2159.05 --> 2162.92
gonna conquer this within my lifetime

2160.7 --> 2165.68
even if I would have to physically

2162.92 --> 2168.9500000000003
undergo torture to achieve it whatever

2165.68 --> 2170.87
it takes whatever it takes no matter the

2168.95 --> 2173.87
hell I have to go through I am gonna

2170.87 --> 2175.64
conquer this I'm gonna be so [ __ ]

2173.87 --> 2181.25
stable it's gonna make people

2175.64 --> 2184.4
uncomfortable so stable I'm gonna be the

2181.25 --> 2189.91
most insanely stable person the world

2184.4 --> 2193.61
has ever seen that is kind of what I

2189.91 --> 2195.41
vowed in the inside even to a

2193.61 --> 2200.33
subconscious level like this is so

2195.41 --> 2206.7999999999997
unacceptable all these skills and that

2200.33 --> 2211.0699999999997
lack of stability it's unacceptable and

2206.8 --> 2214.03
I'm I was gonna force that to stop and

2211.07 --> 2218.69
they've struggled with it for decades

2214.03 --> 2222.02
decades but I'm getting there and one of

2218.69 --> 2227.39
these ways to getting there is it the

2222.02 --> 2231.74
reason why I've been so [ __ ] up level

2227.39 --> 2239.69
honest maybe it's not that [ __ ] up

2231.74 --> 2242.3599999999997
I don't know very honest very open is it

2239.69 --> 2245.66
it is effectively a punishment I'm

2242.36 --> 2248.0
laying bare my back and anyone that

2245.66 --> 2250.91
wants to lash out

2248.0 --> 2254.05
with a whip I'll take it that's

2250.91 --> 2256.79
effectively what this is intuitively

2254.05 --> 2259.46
metaphorically and people pick up on

2256.79 --> 2261.47
that that's why some trolls are just so

2259.46 --> 2263.13
eager they wanna try it but it's because

2261.47 --> 2266.1899999999996
of that also I

2263.13 --> 2269.1600000000003
basically encourage it

2266.19 --> 2271.38
not officially it is effectively that

2269.16 --> 2275.24
process is be encouraged by what I do

2271.38 --> 2283.02
and I wanted and why do I want it

2275.24 --> 2285.8399999999997
because I need I need to fix the

2283.02 --> 2289.68
stability problem and I will expose it

2285.84 --> 2295.65
and I will take lashes of any type of

2289.68 --> 2296.7
whip until until instability is just no

2295.65 --> 2304.08
longer an option

2296.7 --> 2307.98
I will incorporate or an capsule any

2304.08 --> 2310.65
kind of mists control any kind of

2307.98 --> 2314.4
aberration of my character I will build

2310.65 --> 2318.02
a whole castle around it and be super

2314.4 --> 2320.73
open about it so that everybody won't

2318.02 --> 2323.1
get all puzzled up like what is this

2320.73 --> 2324.69
what we're seeing no I'll be so open

2323.1 --> 2328.56
abut now this is how I function it's

2324.69 --> 2332.46
kind of weird it's I'm a handful I'm

2328.56 --> 2336.39
like three people I'm like effectively

2332.46 --> 2340.05
like having three people around and it

2336.39 --> 2343.08
gets very noisy sometimes or very overly

2340.05 --> 2346.26
complicated but I'm working on that so

2343.08 --> 2349.7999999999997
hard and yeah the overly complicated

2346.26 --> 2356.19
part I'm working on basically pushing

2349.8 --> 2360.69
that back inside until it becomes

2356.19 --> 2363.39
absolutely impossible to truly share the

2360.69 --> 2368.15
vulnerability as is that there is no

2363.39 --> 2370.47
more need to just vent out the raw

2368.15 --> 2374.34
desperation and everything that I also

2370.47 --> 2376.95
experienced to no longer allow that into

2374.34 --> 2381.3
the physical world and literally like

2376.95 --> 2383.6899999999996
lock it into a dungeon inside of my mind

2381.3 --> 2383.69
forever

2387.88 --> 2396.53
and then see if if that is tenable like

2394.01 --> 2398.42
will that cause a long-term unbalance

2396.53 --> 2402.26
will that reach a point where I will

2398.42 --> 2406.369
suddenly explode like is that imprisoned

2402.26 --> 2408.079
thing is it gonna die or is it gonna

2406.369 --> 2409.849
come back with a vengeance is the

2408.079 --> 2411.5
pressure gonna build up over time I

2409.849 --> 2416.6600000000003
don't know if this is all very

2411.5 --> 2421.51
experimental but I must achieve

2416.66 --> 2427.5699999999997
stability I must I give myself no choice

2421.51 --> 2427.57
it's literally achieve or die

2432.61 --> 2435.7490000000003
[Music]

2441.76 --> 2447.8500000000004
right well I'm not saying that it's just

2444.88 --> 2450.1600000000003
like oh I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do

2447.85 --> 2451.6
that from now on I'm never gonna show

2450.16 --> 2453.7
you where you got gel like right now no

2451.6 --> 2455.44
no I'm not even ready for that yet now

2453.7 --> 2458.56
what I'm saying is I'm gonna work

2455.44 --> 2462.04
towards that over time I don't know how

2458.56 --> 2464.2599999999998
fast I can do it but I basically given

2462.04 --> 2470.38
that element about me and notice like

2464.26 --> 2475.8900000000003
you're gonna move out I'm retracting

2470.38 --> 2478.9300000000003
you're right of existence within me and

2475.89 --> 2483.6299999999997
you can struggle all you want but I am

2478.93 --> 2487.0899999999997
going to find a way to either

2483.63 --> 2489.96
incorporate you and take any kind of

2487.09 --> 2497.5
miss functionality out of you or to

2489.96 --> 2500.619
encapsulate in me as an open prison so

2497.5 --> 2506.14
that I could share about it like yeah I

2500.619 --> 2508.7400000000002
feel this but it'll never have me be me

2506.14 --> 2508.74
again

2521.21 --> 2529.13
well Aries 106 yeah that's a matter of

2524.42 --> 2532.4900000000002
perspective but yeah it definitely feels

2529.13 --> 2535.52
like that sometimes but yeah the demon

2532.49 --> 2541.6099999999997
is just me it's it's my ego it's the

2535.52 --> 2548.9
offset and it's also because of the

2541.61 --> 2552.29
weird life that I've walked very strange

2548.9 --> 2556.55
choices that I made things that I did

2552.29 --> 2562.82
not confront myself with in exchange for

2556.55 --> 2565.52
something else like in certain ways not

2562.82 --> 2571.04
really grow up but find another way

2565.52 --> 2574.46
through and causing me effectively not

2571.04 --> 2577.1
to be as successful societal wise as

2574.46 --> 2580.82
others but yeah that's it it was part of

2577.1 --> 2584.47
a choice but that has basically made

2580.82 --> 2589.9100000000003
other issues about myself grow worse and

2584.47 --> 2596.8399999999997
yeah I'm reaching that point that I now

2589.91 --> 2603.23
must must once again pick it up and deal

2596.84 --> 2606.2000000000003
with it I must and I also feel I'm ready

2603.23 --> 2608.84
because I I know much more Who I am

2606.2 --> 2610.8199999999997
I'm even confident with it and I also

2608.84 --> 2613.6400000000003
just realize more and more that any kind

2610.82 --> 2615.8900000000003
of rejection when I show this is not

2613.64 --> 2618.14
because of me is not because I got it

2615.89 --> 2620.6299999999997
wrong because other people can't

2618.14 --> 2623.48
freaking handle it a lot of people can

2620.63 --> 2628.07
handle it and thus I must learn to find

2623.48 --> 2632.08
a way also to do effectively what I do

2628.07 --> 2632.0800000000004
with the honesty that I have without

2632.5 --> 2640.64
touching too many vulnerabilities in

2636.89 --> 2643.6099999999997
other people as I do it to find a way

2640.64 --> 2647.69
around and I have been doing training

2643.61 --> 2652.1200000000003
that as well hey the ballers are the

2647.69 --> 2652.12
biggest projects in that sense

2654.099 --> 2659.3900000000003
it's about how do you deal with

2656.9 --> 2666.2000000000003
somebody's problem without directly

2659.39 --> 2670.0989999999997
confronting it like and yeah the biggest

2666.2 --> 2674.0
trick is always like how do you make

2670.099 --> 2676.46
people wanna learn and overcome their

2674.0 --> 2677.869
mistake it's a very tough one because

2676.46 --> 2680.059
then you're gonna deal with like a

2677.869 --> 2682.4900000000002
little kid again it's always where that

2680.059 --> 2684.23
starts this little kid they had a

2682.49 --> 2686.5099999999998
certain thing coming their pop in their

2684.23 --> 2688.789
head mindset a way of doing things and

2686.51 --> 2691.73
then their parents just couldn't take

2688.789 --> 2693.619
that out of them and that just carried

2691.73 --> 2697.579
on the rest of their life and that's

2693.619 --> 2699.619
usually what every single issue is so

2697.579 --> 2703.1600000000003
it's like I have to raise an entire

2699.619 --> 2706.849
world of hidden children in people's

2703.16 --> 2709.67
mind like little kids stuck in there in

2706.849 --> 2712.46
that entire person that have not been

2709.67 --> 2715.42
properly dealt with that's what it feels

2712.46 --> 2715.42
like a lot of the times

2727.17 --> 2732.54
yeah when you meet new people you must

2730.2 --> 2735.0
declare your goals boldly Robin Stanley

2732.54 --> 2737.67
thank you that is so on target

2735.0 --> 2740.73
that is so untied and it is something

2737.67 --> 2742.56
that I must do indeed and I've tried it

2740.73 --> 2745.56
before the problem was every time I did

2742.56 --> 2749.2799999999997
that I would get like almost like an

2745.56 --> 2751.56
applause and then a rejection like job

2749.28 --> 2754.8300000000004
situations like wow that is that's

2751.56 --> 2757.16
really awesome but sorry we can you're

2754.83 --> 2762.08
not complying that doesn't work here

2757.16 --> 2765.8599999999997
yeah yeah that makes me feel just great

2762.08 --> 2770.22
but that's probably because I just

2765.86 --> 2772.4700000000003
didn't really know where I would be long

2770.22 --> 2774.7099999999996
and I didn't know where to look I didn't

2772.47 --> 2777.5099999999998
look in the right places my mind was

2774.71 --> 2777.93
sending me to wrong places why did they

2777.51 --> 2780.92
do that

2777.93 --> 2783.7799999999997
well maybe because my mind was still

2780.92 --> 2786.7200000000003
subconsciously obsessed with ensuring

2783.78 --> 2791.8500000000004
that I would never ever have a job it

2786.72 --> 2794.22
was like an insane vow like because

2791.85 --> 2796.68
that's kind of been there as well it's

2794.22 --> 2799.0499999999997
like doubling down on that mistake and

2796.68 --> 2801.4199999999996
see if I can handle that if I could

2799.05 --> 2804.09
survive that if you could survive in the

2801.42 --> 2810.96
world without becoming a corrupted troll

2804.09 --> 2818.7000000000003
like figure disgusting idiot and well I

2810.96 --> 2823.44
succeeded at that but you also get kind

2818.7 --> 2829.08
of stuck still can't keep on ascending

2823.44 --> 2831.23
from that position and that's where I'm

2829.08 --> 2831.23
at

2838.3 --> 2862.01
[Music]

2839.62 --> 2863.87
right so most people just want to live

2862.01 --> 2869.5400000000004
their life in peace and do good as they

2863.87 --> 2872.72
can to their ability I don't know about

2869.54 --> 2877.64
that I think that really depends on the

2872.72 --> 2882.68
region you have I don't think the most

2877.64 --> 2888.98
people really do that I think most

2882.68 --> 2890.74
people are often driven by riches and

2888.98 --> 2895.179
that could be happiness rich

2890.74 --> 2895.1789999999996
[Music]

2899.12 --> 2908.7799999999997
how's that I was OBS just suddenly cut

2903.9 --> 2908.78
out no idea why

2915.22 --> 2935.08
Oh God this all right so you believe in

2932.74 --> 2938.2299999999996
good in the good in most people well hey

2935.08 --> 2941.619
I believe as I know there's good in

2938.23 --> 2946.3
people but that doesn't mean that that

2941.619 --> 2948.2200000000003
good is in control that doesn't mean

2946.3 --> 2952.599
that the good is actually performing

2948.22 --> 2956.5899999999997
actions right that's the big difference

2952.599 --> 2958.2400000000002
you have a I too believe in the good in

2956.59 --> 2966.48
people but that doesn't mean that that

2958.24 --> 2966.4799999999996
good is in control it's just a seed

2975.67 --> 2978.7290000000003
[Music]

2982.29 --> 2989.31
right and yeah you have to cherish that

2985.95 --> 2991.0499999999997
you have to actually feed it you have to

2989.31 --> 2995.06
feed the good you have to inspire it you

2991.05 --> 2997.71
have to give people a reason to

2995.06 --> 3009.02
strengthen it and conjure it up and make

2997.71 --> 3011.96
it drive it to act and also effectively

3009.02 --> 3016.04
act not just like oh it feels so good

3011.96 --> 3017.87
people say that if I do this or like if

3016.04 --> 3020.81
I do this then everyone will believe

3017.87 --> 3027.67
that I also support good oh that's not

3020.81 --> 3027.67
really good that's just virtue signaling

3031.53 --> 3040.65
no real good is like a bow

3036.35 --> 3046.5899999999997
it's a promise to not do bad but also to

3040.65 --> 3052.56
take responsibility for that and to yeah

3046.59 --> 3055.17
to make sure that darkness doesn't enter

3052.56 --> 3057.0299999999997
in you but also in others if you don't

3055.17 --> 3061.9500000000003
do it with others then it's eventually

3057.03 --> 3069.27
gonna slip into you as well it's just

3061.95 --> 3073.1699999999996
dispelling you basically you can't just

3069.27 --> 3075.12
act like good and not actually do good

3073.17 --> 3077.57
then it's not gonna work it's just gonna

3075.12 --> 3077.5699999999997
be an act

3082.37 --> 3091.3399999999997
you need to believe what you're doing

3086.62 --> 3096.2599999999998
you also need to understand what it

3091.34 --> 3099.76
really does and what the world that it

3096.26 --> 3102.4
is being performed on actually is and

3099.76 --> 3104.8100000000004
then it then it can be really good

3102.4 --> 3107.12
otherwise it's just virtue signaling

3104.81 --> 3109.34
like you can do something that seems

3107.12 --> 3111.8599999999997
good if you don't even understand what

3109.34 --> 3114.61
it's doing how is it good if it just

3111.86 --> 3114.61
seems good

3123.2 --> 3129.5589999999997
right cuz I don't know to some people

3126.849 --> 3131.299
being Oh like all climate change we have

3129.559 --> 3135.3190000000004
to do everything for climate change that

3131.299 --> 3137.96
seems good to them you know people that

3135.319 --> 3139.579
do that a lot of it it probably seems

3137.96 --> 3142.01
good to them and they will even be

3139.579 --> 3143.21
pulled into Yahoo population oh my god

3142.01 --> 3147.38
we have to do something about it

3143.21 --> 3151.2400000000002
and it'll still seem good even though

3147.38 --> 3154.54
it's all been polluted effectively

3151.24 --> 3156.97
because why because they don't

3154.54 --> 3159.5589999999997
understand it they don't understand

3156.97 --> 3162.7099999999996
what's happening what the world really

3159.559 --> 3166.6090000000004
is they don't understand the

3162.71 --> 3169.94
consequences so they will think it's

3166.609 --> 3173.24
really good what they're doing on some

3169.94 --> 3174.26
you know some others will be realizing

3173.24 --> 3177.109
what they're doing and they're still

3174.26 --> 3178.88
gonna do it for money or something that

3177.109 --> 3180.859
rubs off but there's people out there

3178.88 --> 3183.4100000000003
that really believe this and they say

3180.859 --> 3186.0099999999998
this because they think it's good it's

3183.41 --> 3191.049
not because they don't understand what

3186.01 --> 3197.5890000000004
they're doing see without understanding

3191.049 --> 3197.589
good can kind of turn into folly you

3198.069 --> 3204.13
know good is not easy without proper

3202.339 --> 3209.44
understanding it

3204.13 --> 3209.44
it's just folly it's just a feeling

3212.339 --> 3219.13
this is also a problem for religion

3216.989 --> 3223.089
because in a way they're counting on

3219.13 --> 3225.789
that effect there just thinks and you

3223.089 --> 3228.069
just are convinced this is good but you

3225.789 --> 3234.88
don't truly understand it only is

3228.069 --> 3238.39
certain things then in ways that becomes

3234.88 --> 3241.029
folly and that's an element that I find

3238.39 --> 3243.16
very disturbing but yeah try to find

3241.029 --> 3245.859
anyone in the world that does not have

3243.16 --> 3248.3689999999997
that is perfect at this is I haven't

3245.859 --> 3248.369
found one

3263.15 --> 3270.48
anyway because of this too that it yeah

3267.96 --> 3273.54
that is this realization is also what

3270.48 --> 3276.27
drives me to do what I do to look into

3273.54 --> 3279.15
things and really find multiple angles

3276.27 --> 3284.64
to what it is what it really is what it

3279.15 --> 3288.63
does - yeah determinate that the magic

3284.64 --> 3293.46
of a situation like anything could seem

3288.63 --> 3295.59
very basic if you really unleash sharp

3293.46 --> 3298.88
a sensitive mind on it then you could

3295.59 --> 3301.9100000000003
see so much more into it and by doing so

3298.88 --> 3304.8900000000003
understand more about it and that

3301.91 --> 3308.7599999999998
understanding reinforces the entire

3304.89 --> 3314.1
thing the purpose the confidence the

3308.76 --> 3316.4100000000003
dedication with it and that's part of

3314.1 --> 3334.5299999999997
what I do is what I try to do is it's

3316.41 --> 3339.2599999999998
like my it's my paladin job this okay

3334.53 --> 3345.9
Loretta that's that's nice

3339.26 --> 3350.6600000000003
no idea what you're talking about did

3345.9 --> 3350.6600000000003
you meet a girl that's cool

3364.79 --> 3372.32
okay yeah mr. Aquino three yes I am

3369.29 --> 3377.0299999999997
making money from you two but I don't

3372.32 --> 3379.69
really get to keep much of it because

3377.03 --> 3383.3300000000004
everything I my income through Google

3379.69 --> 3388.4900000000002
mostly gets just detracted from my

3383.33 --> 3391.69
social welfare income just like my

3388.49 --> 3391.6899999999996
newspaper round money

3397.65 --> 3400.9990000000003
that's all fine

3416.9 --> 3426.9500000000003
okatee haba so what consider normal is

3423.56 --> 3428.9
for many world-shattering catastrophes I

3426.95 --> 3433.93
don't know it's only for seven years

3428.9 --> 3433.9300000000003
mostly you know

3437.339 --> 3443.46
a lot of saffron yet people basically

3440.249 --> 3447.569
live in hell because they're constantly

3443.46 --> 3450.989
and I know everything about it okay at

3447.569 --> 3454.769
that it's because that effect I I had

3450.989 --> 3457.349
that very early on but I contained it a

3454.769 --> 3459.9599999999996
lot my response would be introspect I

3457.349 --> 3461.88
wouldn't blurt it out constantly because

3459.96 --> 3463.589
then everyone would freaking hate me and

3461.88 --> 3466.559
I could not live with that she would

3463.589 --> 3468.299
keep in a lot a lot of sivanna elements

3466.559 --> 3473.2490000000003
were secret and it would just have

3468.299 --> 3475.619
hellish fantasies and insights it's like

3473.249 --> 3477.6899999999996
people would say certain things me not

3475.619 --> 3481.4100000000003
realizing that in a way they would be

3477.69 --> 3484.469
bluffing I even revealed this not too

3481.41 --> 3487.529
long ago like things that seemed would

3484.469 --> 3493.349
lead to absolute nightmarish insights or

3487.529 --> 3497.009
something on my part would just turn out

3493.349 --> 3499.7690000000002
to be a bluff in a way from Lois not

3497.009 --> 3504.329
everything was a bluff but a lot of

3499.769 --> 3506.729
things were and not just a bluff in the

3504.329 --> 3509.46
moment like an excuse for the person but

3506.729 --> 3512.0389999999998
it would be like a more Bluff of the

3509.46 --> 3513.66
system that the person would convey that

3512.039 --> 3520.0190000000002
they'd really did not understand

3513.66 --> 3525.93
themselves yeah yeah but the the word

3520.019 --> 3530.519
sarvagna it's a little thing I got from

3525.93 --> 3535.319
own Benjamin and it's Sal Vanya is

3530.519 --> 3539.1299999999997
basically a an obsessive character that

3535.319 --> 3544.2
thinks that they know the whole truth

3539.13 --> 3546.119
and that always get very eat that tend

3544.2 --> 3549.749
to get very paranoid when analyzing

3546.119 --> 3554.19
somebody and like get overblown with

3549.749 --> 3556.529
things and yeah that I don't know that's

3554.19 --> 3559.44
a typical character type that we've all

3556.529 --> 3561.059
met one way or another a lot of people

3559.44 --> 3562.44
even in their real physical lives not

3561.059 --> 3564.5690000000004
just on the internet the Internet is

3562.44 --> 3568.14
riddled with those people absolutely

3564.569 --> 3570.0589999999997
riddled they they vent off a lot in the

3568.14 --> 3571.17
internet so message board are usually

3570.059 --> 3574.32
filled with

3571.17 --> 3580.29
fournier crap just obsessive overblown

3574.32 --> 3582.1200000000003
and just to stereotype levels it is a

3580.29 --> 3584.84
made-up word well it is yeah it is a

3582.12 --> 3591.96
made-up word it is a cultural reference

3584.84 --> 3594.75
it was originally woke rapes we could

3591.96 --> 3597.57
call it that this bit crude and yeah it

3594.75 --> 3600.81
was originally based on error to base

3597.57 --> 3605.88
followers who are very notoriously

3600.81 --> 3609.0299999999997
aggressive and like if you don't they're

3605.88 --> 3611.2200000000003
very cultish I guess you could say if

3609.03 --> 3612.9
you don't just completely worship

3611.22 --> 3621.8999999999996
somebody they'll just start attacking

3612.9 --> 3624.4500000000003
you right so that's that's the savonia

3621.9 --> 3627.3
it's a cultural phenomena it's a

3624.45 --> 3630.4199999999996
character type and there's a lot of them

3627.3 --> 3632.8700000000003
and there's it's also not too hard to

3630.42 --> 3635.82
figure out at least for me to understand

3632.87 --> 3639.0
why they are the way they are like how

3635.82 --> 3641.76
has that come to pass how has these

3639.0 --> 3646.86
grown people grown into this situation

3641.76 --> 3652.61
because I myself was there I understand

3646.86 --> 3655.4700000000003
it like in my peak of my Alex Jones time

3652.61 --> 3660.69
way before the whole Trump situation and

3655.47 --> 3663.12
everything I was like that but I would

3660.69 --> 3666.06
keep it to myself there would be

3663.12 --> 3668.0699999999997
absolute paranoid multi-layer insights

3666.06 --> 3670.41
but it would be it would go into

3668.07 --> 3676.2000000000003
craziness and I would keep almost

3670.41 --> 3679.5
everything to myself but I would yeah

3676.2 --> 3683.4199999999996
non-stop conspiracies spirits spirity

3679.5 --> 3683.42
thinking basically non-stop

3686.66 --> 3693.39
but it's not good and it lets it makes

3692.25 --> 3695.97
you eventually

3693.39 --> 3697.92
Icona phi and over generalize almost

3695.97 --> 3701.5099999999998
everything and then you lose track

3697.92 --> 3704.609
because the reality is not properly

3701.51 --> 3707.4
reflected with its fractal the app depth

3704.609 --> 3710.7
but instead becomes completely like a

3707.4 --> 3714.78
board of ikana fide things that just

3710.7 --> 3718.52
link in what will eventually be a subpar

3714.78 --> 3722.52
mechanism of connection it's not real

3718.52 --> 3727.19
it's a model a very large conspiracy

3722.52 --> 3730.74
based model and it's not real and you

3727.19 --> 3733.53
the way I say it now that may light up a

3730.74 --> 3736.1699999999996
sense in you that like yes that's

3733.53 --> 3738.0
exactly what these conspiracy mothers

3736.17 --> 3739.56
are like it's like yeah they they know

3738.0 --> 3741.72
some truth they've really bred some

3739.56 --> 3748.02
truth but the conclusions they've drawn

3741.72 --> 3751.6189999999997
has provided to them a broken world view

3748.02 --> 3755.46
that is incomplete and they get obsessed

3751.619 --> 3758.33
over it and that is also part of the

3755.46 --> 3758.33
savant syndrome

3760.42 --> 3763.579
[Music]

3768.2 --> 3771.2
right

3773.519 --> 3781.4199999999996
and yet to top to top all that it's it

3778.449 --> 3786.219
gets even worse really don't worry about

3781.42 --> 3789.309
it though but the media the media

3786.219 --> 3791.68
apparatus the learning school of media

3789.309 --> 3795.15
manipulation that's pretty much freely

3791.68 --> 3799.39
available these days has figured out

3795.15 --> 3804.609
misophonia syndrome that's why you're

3799.39 --> 3807.729
seeing now how the elements that feed

3804.609 --> 3813.8489999999997
into savonius syndrome are getting

3807.729 --> 3816.939
integrated in everything in regular news

3813.849 --> 3818.829
way of thinking and speaking in the

3816.939 --> 3823.5989999999997
alternative news way of thinking and

3818.829 --> 3828.549
speaking and the way presenters conduct

3823.599 --> 3832.329
themselves there are literally elements

3828.549 --> 3836.41
being implanted ways of doing things

3832.329 --> 3840.1890000000003
strategies to feed into savonius

3836.41 --> 3843.8799999999997
syndrome and bind people within certain

3840.189 --> 3847.269
savonia views of subjects with

3843.88 --> 3850.42
extremities that are taken out of

3847.269 --> 3853.4199999999996
context because that feeds into savonius

3850.42 --> 3858.369
syndrome and it binds people it's a

3853.42 --> 3861.64
trick it's a magic trick and media is

3858.369 --> 3864.6400000000003
doing that very widely why are they

3861.64 --> 3867.489
doing that because they just like me

3864.64 --> 3869.769
have come to understand and probably

3867.489 --> 3876.2490000000003
even have statistical proof of this that

3869.769 --> 3878.529
a huge percentage of people especially

3876.249 --> 3881.259
the more intelligent natured ones have

3878.529 --> 3885.809
developed savonia syndrome and a lot of

3881.259 --> 3889.059
them - absolutely severe levels and

3885.809 --> 3891.9100000000003
that's why they're doing that they

3889.059 --> 3896.4990000000003
realized there's a type of cultural

3891.91 --> 3899.2889999999998
insanity some modern insanity it's

3896.499 --> 3903.0499999999997
overcome the world in the West

3899.289 --> 3908.3590000000004
especially and they are

3903.05 --> 3913.71
tapping into it to feed on it to bind it

3908.359 --> 3917.46
and basically effectively get money from

3913.71 --> 3920.64
them oh dear I revealed myself

3917.46 --> 3922.53
no no definitely filled myself I I hope

3920.64 --> 3924.48
I'm not playing into cell phone yet

3922.53 --> 3928.77
syndrome I'm actually trying to dispel

3924.48 --> 3931.89
it as much as I can I'm pretty sure that

3928.77 --> 3934.859
this is happening and people will

3931.89 --> 3938.18
already have felt what I'm describing

3934.859 --> 3943.79
now I'm just putting it in a framework

3938.18 --> 3946.819
now to clear up what that actually is

3943.79 --> 3950.48
Cronenberg syndrome what's that

3946.819 --> 3950.48
I've heard of that

3969.31 --> 3987.65
okay that David Cronenberg no it's what

3975.83 --> 3989.87
is it isn't it with a que no I I don't

3987.65 --> 3999.5
know what you're talking about I can't

3989.87 --> 4002.0499999999997
find it's with a que it what is it your

3999.5 --> 4005.44
own thing that you feel that you made up

4002.05 --> 4010.4100000000003
because I can't find it on Google that's

4005.44 --> 4010.41
just a reference to David Cronenberg in

4012.96 --> 4025.18
or is it Levant and Cronenberg Goodman

4016.93 --> 4027.0099999999998
syndrome is that it what you're gonna

4025.18 --> 4028.72
have to link me up somehow to what

4027.01 --> 4031.23
you're talking about because I can't

4028.72 --> 4031.23
figure it out

4037.36 --> 4040.3990000000003
[Music]

4046.87 --> 4052.98
oh so it is something you you made up

4053.22 --> 4060.25
all right I thought you were actually

4055.8 --> 4064.69
that you figured out a real official

4060.25 --> 4067.21
syndrome that that because like savonius

4064.69 --> 4069.69
syndrome it's just a stupid word it's

4067.21 --> 4072.04
even it's like a meme based origin

4069.69 --> 4077.08
description business description world

4072.04 --> 4078.91
it's doesn't mean anything god I

4077.08 --> 4080.86
definitely wouldn't want to call it

4078.91 --> 4084.1
Arwen syndrome just because I discovered

4080.86 --> 4088.48
it as a psychology I didn't really I'm

4084.1 --> 4091.54
just describing it in detail let's not

4088.48 --> 4094.86
do that but I was just kind of hoping

4091.54 --> 4097.42
that there was an official name for it

4094.86 --> 4100.47
that it that I wouldn't be the first to

4097.42 --> 4100.47
identify this

4107.55 --> 4110.629
[Music]

4123.109 --> 4133.339
from the movie the fly I yeah I'm

4131.509 --> 4137.359
completely lost in what you're talking

4133.339 --> 4145.489
about now you have a no idea what you're

4137.359 --> 4147.92
talking about now they choose it did you

4145.489 --> 4152.718999999999
make it up or is it a real thing or is

4147.92 --> 4154.819
it like a another cultural description

4152.719 --> 4160.219
that is very similar to what I'm talking

4154.819 --> 4163.31
about because so many things are made up

4160.219 --> 4165.2300000000005
now in this world just based on some

4163.31 --> 4167.06
kind of movie character this or that you

4165.23 --> 4169.5689999999995
know as endless amount of things people

4167.06 --> 4169.569
make up

4189.279 --> 4193.320000000001
it occurred all right it's a Lirette

4191.56 --> 4197.490000000001
path yeah

4193.32 --> 4197.49
the two are getting mixed up

4203.33 --> 4207.25
a Cronenberg

4208.88 --> 4220.76
well why don't you just call them Corona

4211.13 --> 4223.31
victims you know technically in a way

4220.76 --> 4226.280000000001
you could even say that that is correct

4223.31 --> 4228.77
from multiple perspectives I just called

4226.28 --> 4232.58
them Corona victims if you want to give

4228.77 --> 4234.2300000000005
it a name and people be like what did

4232.58 --> 4237.53
they die of it and then you just say

4234.23 --> 4239.36
well technically people don't die of

4237.53 --> 4242.09
Corona but there seem to be a lot of

4239.36 --> 4252.23
people that have become like mental

4242.09 --> 4255.4400000000005
victims to it just look them right and

4252.23 --> 4261.0199999999995
by the way just a little plug David

4255.44 --> 4263.78
Weiss had a video was it got nine hours

4261.02 --> 4266.3
ago the so this night I watched it and

4263.78 --> 4271.13
it's basically describing just that

4266.3 --> 4273.83
Corona victims the video is called we

4271.13 --> 4275.81
are living in a golden slumbers and it's

4273.83 --> 4281.36
just a lot of footage of people wearing

4275.81 --> 4285.400000000001
kuroda mask so here is it take a look

4281.36 --> 4285.4
it's fire it's less than six minutes

4303.47 --> 4310.38
but hey if you're you could call it

4307.41 --> 4318.08
Corona victims you could call it Corona

4310.38 --> 4322.35
syndrome although that would probably

4318.08 --> 4324.63
forgive some issues since Corona

4322.35 --> 4327.51
syndrome may also be I don't know a

4324.63 --> 4330.3
physical physical medical condition

4327.51 --> 4332.400000000001
state that may actually be involved in

4330.3 --> 4335.21
some ways like if the body is just doing

4332.4 --> 4341.19
really bad then you'll have the corona

4335.21 --> 4343.29
virus elements will be there and might

4341.19 --> 4346.08
have some kind of typical influence and

4343.29 --> 4347.49
they may actually call that corona

4346.08 --> 4349.2
syndrome I don't know what they're

4347.49 --> 4352.3099999999995
calling those types of things maybe

4349.2 --> 4354.8099999999995
they'll have some Latin name or whatever

4352.31 --> 4357.360000000001
but yeah that may be a little bit

4354.81 --> 4360.030000000001
complicated but if you just call them

4357.36 --> 4365.91
Corona victims then yep pretty much

4360.03 --> 4367.889999999999
young target right that's right Jorge

4365.91 --> 4371.55
Sanford nobody ever dies of a cold alone

4367.89 --> 4375.81
that's why it's the the corona deaths

4371.55 --> 4379.860000000001
are always comorbidities if it was if

4375.81 --> 4381.93
they even had a test because at the same

4379.86 --> 4384.45
time it's also been testified now

4381.93 --> 4387.6900000000005
multiple accounts that people that

4384.45 --> 4393.09
haven't even been tested would just get

4387.69 --> 4397.5599999999995
tagged corona death so but that doesn't

4393.09 --> 4399.81
mean that nobody ever dies with corona

4397.56 --> 4403.04
because that can happen that that's why

4399.81 --> 4403.04
it's called comorbidity

4417.89 --> 4422.660000000001
right now but yeah that's exactly right

4424.7 --> 4434.61
and then there's that issued yard

4427.35 --> 4437.370000000001
Sanford it's a chariot mess but yeah

4434.61 --> 4442.5
whether the tests are false positives

4437.37 --> 4444.78
are not people yeah it's always going to

4442.5 --> 4447.15
be if they even have it it's gonna be a

4444.78 --> 4449.46
comorbidity case because no healthy

4447.15 --> 4453.12
person could ever just die of it just

4449.46 --> 4456.41
like that unless they had some yeah all

4453.12 --> 4460.91
their situation that was peaking and

4456.41 --> 4463.44
then the combination just like sudden

4460.91 --> 4468.12
physical stability collapse for some

4463.44 --> 4472.259999999999
reason I don't know like extreme stress

4468.12 --> 4474.15
and like heavy exposure to toxicity that

4472.26 --> 4476.79
you're not used to yeah that could

4474.15 --> 4479.099999999999
potentially just from a seemingly

4476.79 --> 4482.96
healthy state made you absolutely

4479.1 --> 4482.96
collapse at some point

4492.93 --> 4496.009
[Music]

4500.74 --> 4509.5
we have a it's it's all just nonsense

4504.43 --> 4513.34
it really is nonsense because the yeah

4509.5 --> 4515.5
corona variety of virus elements if you

4513.34 --> 4519.400000000001
could even if we should even call it a

4515.5 --> 4522.07
virus really but that thing and the

4519.4 --> 4524.41
flaring up on the yearly basis during

4522.07 --> 4528.07
flu season it's been there for a long

4524.41 --> 4531.01
time so they're not really learning

4528.07 --> 4535.57
they've just been railroaded into a

4531.01 --> 4538.150000000001
ridiculous response procedure and yeah

4535.57 --> 4541.69
they have to figure out that it is a

4538.15 --> 4544.12
ridiculous response procedure and then

4541.69 --> 4546.37
once they do that and yeah the sooner

4544.12 --> 4548.7699999999995
this whole thing is completely discarded

4546.37 --> 4552.099999999999
just throw down the memory hole just

4548.77 --> 4554.700000000001
screw that screw every nonsense about it

4552.1 --> 4557.89
just move on like nothing ever happened

4554.7 --> 4560.41
you know that would be better at this

4557.89 --> 4562.84
point just forget about it it was stupid

4560.41 --> 4566.08
it was useless it was detrimental to the

4562.84 --> 4568.83
economy everybody's just annoyed the

4566.08 --> 4571.09
[ __ ] out of ya over it it's just

4568.83 --> 4574.93
everybody's sick of it everybody's sick

4571.09 --> 4579.1900000000005
of Corona fear poor nonsense and this

4574.93 --> 4588.55
weird [ __ ] coming out constantly dancing

4579.19 --> 4592.03
videos are just so yeah this the sooner

4588.55 --> 4593.05
it just goes away then doctors could

4592.03 --> 4598.78
once again

4593.05 --> 4602.02
I don't know approach flu season and all

4598.78 --> 4603.969999999999
that in a more sensible fashion and

4602.02 --> 4607.6
maybe do a little study up on

4603.97 --> 4611.52
alternatives to virus theory maybe what

4607.6 --> 4612.64
does they call again field theory or

4611.52 --> 4615.96
environment

4612.64 --> 4619.360000000001
Theory approaching it is more

4615.96 --> 4624.06
microbiology situation yeah that would

4619.36 --> 4624.0599999999995
do a great amount of good

4624.989 --> 4631.209
and it could eat like this understanding

4628.15 --> 4635.709
could even make doctors perform better

4631.209 --> 4639.82
and more efficient in flu season say

4635.709 --> 4644.019
don't ya then they're basically acting

4639.82 --> 4646.329
upon a virtual medical scenario and they

4644.019 --> 4647.860000000001
yeah then effectively don't know what

4646.329 --> 4650.619
they're doing they're following their

4647.86 --> 4656.049999999999
teaching but they just don't understand

4650.619 --> 4658.659
then that it's not really real in many

4656.05 --> 4663.749
ways that the ideas of viruses are just

4658.659 --> 4666.909
not like that there's more likelihood of

4663.749 --> 4671.369
psychosomatic effects concerning viral

4666.909 --> 4674.558999999999
situations that it is psychosomatically

4671.369 --> 4677.728999999999
simulated and thus manifested seemingly

4674.559 --> 4680.229
so then that there is an actual

4677.729 --> 4684.400000000001
subconscious process like that happening

4680.229 --> 4688.6900000000005
that people really do get infected as

4684.4 --> 4691.209
they say you know because that just

4688.69 --> 4694.558999999999
shouldn't happen that's not how it

4691.209 --> 4694.559
forget it's not consistent

4702.849 --> 4705.42
yeah

4706.75 --> 4716.68
I in a way just you could see it like

4714.28 --> 4721.12
this if there's just a community they're

4716.68 --> 4724.570000000001
all very healthy very well they eat good

4721.12 --> 4727.72
food they have sound morals Terry with

4724.57 --> 4732.49
logos and then this person from the city

4727.72 --> 4734.740000000001
or whatever comes there gets really sick

4732.49 --> 4738.07
it's even considered like oh my god this

4734.74 --> 4741.76
is like a really bad type of flu there's

4738.07 --> 4744.16
absolutely no guarantee that anyone in

4741.76 --> 4747.37
that village will get it there's no

4744.16 --> 4749.5599999999995
guarantee now on the other hand if you

4747.37 --> 4751.51
had a village that's not very morally

4749.56 --> 4753.93
sound that don't eat very well that

4751.51 --> 4756.49
fight among one another and all that

4753.93 --> 4759.820000000001
that get everybody gets caught up in

4756.49 --> 4762.01
anger ego issues yeah which will lead to

4759.82 --> 4766.08
just a demoralized atmosphere in general

4762.01 --> 4768.7300000000005
then if somebody does catch some kind of

4766.08 --> 4770.95
disease there that could be considered

4768.73 --> 4774.49
infectious then there is a much greater

4770.95 --> 4781.03
likelihood that it will seemingly spread

4774.49 --> 4784.42
why because this type of thing comes

4781.03 --> 4788.17
forth this is as a response to as I've

4784.42 --> 4791.8
said before demoralization like things

4788.17 --> 4793.54
issues in the body toxins that build up

4791.8 --> 4795.7300000000005
and then yeah if there is the whole

4793.54 --> 4798.48
place where everybody is kind of like

4795.73 --> 4800.589999999999
that in that state and everybody

4798.48 --> 4803.29
communicates with one another in that

4800.59 --> 4806.05
state then it is much more likely that

4803.29 --> 4810.34
if some kind of transformation process

4806.05 --> 4810.7300000000005
happens the disease as its medically

4810.34 --> 4813.34
called

4810.73 --> 4816.879999999999
that that would then transfer to

4813.34 --> 4818.17
everybody else in the same state because

4816.88 --> 4820.03
it's a transformation process

4818.17 --> 4821.97
everybody's in that state so everybody

4820.03 --> 4827.349999999999
will undergo that transformation process

4821.97 --> 4829.87
now any kind of complete outsider of the

4827.35 --> 4831.88
of such a demoralized place that would

4829.87 --> 4835.51
come there would be very strong in their

4831.88 --> 4837.1
soul that would not let that atmosphere

4835.51 --> 4838.219
rub off on them they would be very

4837.1 --> 4840.019
protective they will

4838.219 --> 4843.86
not get that disease I could almost

4840.019 --> 4846.679
guarantee it they wouldn't because they

4843.86 --> 4849.799999999999
are not in that physical and mental

4846.679 --> 4851.809
condition that is kind of required for

4849.8 --> 4854.09
such a cascade process to happen for

4851.809 --> 4856.309
such a sudden transformation disease

4854.09 --> 4858.05
like symptoms to suddenly spread you

4856.309 --> 4862.34
have to have the right conditions in

4858.05 --> 4865.84
order for that to even happen that's how

4862.34 --> 4865.84
I think it really works

4902.65 --> 4907.5
without anybody got anything to say

4905.08 --> 4907.5
about that

4929.01 --> 4938.66
yes Steve it's definitely Amanda with a

4931.95 --> 4942.54
H at the end Amanda Amanda Amanda

4938.66 --> 4946.25
effectively she doesn't like it when

4942.54 --> 4946.25
people misspell her her name

4953.12 --> 4959.15
Rodrigo wait which Rodrigo is that

4966.43 --> 4969.539000000001
[Music]

4974.369 --> 4982.67
Robin which rodrigo do you mean I don't

4979.679 --> 4982.67
exactly know who that is

5003.23 --> 5013.179999999999
[Music]

5010.0 --> 5013.18
[Applause]

5016.22 --> 5022.97
all right yeah that's no use trying to

5019.71 --> 5029.16
look for a name of course on google fe

5022.97 --> 5031.37
anthropologist okay I I don't know about

5029.16 --> 5035.13
him who is that

5031.37 --> 5037.62
but I'd be absolutely open to talk with

5035.13 --> 5039.63
anyone about it especially people that I

5037.62 --> 5042.53
don't know actually have studied and

5039.63 --> 5046.77
worked in the field instead of just

5042.53 --> 5049.94
second hand gazed and analyzed that's

5046.77 --> 5049.9400000000005
what I've done all my life

5064.83 --> 5068.87
okay George Sanford I didn't know

5084.92 --> 5088.4
hey Jen

5096.98 --> 5100.099999999999
[Music]

5103.44 --> 5110.5599999999995
it's just amazing

5105.25 --> 5112.8
look it's even more beautiful now how

5110.56 --> 5112.8
did that

5133.65 --> 5142.599999999999
so that's amazing sight and yeah this

5140.23 --> 5146.7
guy really does seem very blue and clear

5142.6 --> 5146.700000000001
up here it's nice

5164.11 --> 5168.1089999999995
what

5164.97 --> 5168.109
[Music]

5181.0 --> 5186.76
okay a video from a crazy guy from

5185.11 --> 5189.12
Australia I have no idea what you're

5186.76 --> 5189.12
talking about

5209.2 --> 5212.398999999999
[Music]

5214.65 --> 5221.009999999999
what Amanda young really New York looks

5218.13 --> 5225.409000000001
so pretty and clear and smell so clean

5221.01 --> 5225.409000000001
is that sarcastic

5230.21 --> 5235.87
because I've heard that it can be quite

5233.27 --> 5235.870000000001
the opposite

5245.889 --> 5254.92
now Rodrigo Ferrari Nunez you know of

5249.79 --> 5258.46
him do i mm-hmm well that's a more

5254.92 --> 5261.3
elaborate name I'll search on that maybe

5258.46 --> 5261.3
it'll ring a bell

5269.249 --> 5284.21
oh he doesn't officially appear on his

5279.989 --> 5284.209999999999
own videos a waiter is that him

5294.699 --> 5302.889999999999
the name does sound familiar to me

5297.19 --> 5303.759999999999
though but I don't know where where did

5302.89 --> 5307.860000000001
he hang around

5303.76 --> 5307.860000000001
where did he do shows and all that

5308.1 --> 5314.8
anyway I will subscribe to him just to

5311.429 --> 5317.8
see just to check him out if you say

5314.8 --> 5319.900000000001
he's really good what comes to

5317.8 --> 5327.85
conversation worthy then they I'm up for

5319.9 --> 5335.79
it is any part of the globe us is he is

5327.85 --> 5339.76
he one of the glow Buster's okay okay

5335.79 --> 5342.219
well to be fair I don't really watch

5339.76 --> 5345.9400000000005
blow Buster's heaven for a while

5342.219 --> 5347.9800000000005
sometimes like if it happens to be life

5345.94 --> 5355.178999999999
I'll click on it just to see what it's

5347.98 --> 5359.169999999999
like but yeah I think it's I don't know

5355.179 --> 5361.0
in my personal opinion but a hard margin

5359.17 --> 5361.3
intellectual blah blah blah no not

5361.0 --> 5362.98
really

5361.3 --> 5370.75
I know I think it's getting kind of

5362.98 --> 5374.62
stale it's not not yeah sorry it's just

5370.75 --> 5379.83
what it is it's just it it's not as

5374.62 --> 5383.11
interesting to me as it used to be and

5379.83 --> 5386.44
yeah I don't know I'd much rather hang

5383.11 --> 5389.23
around the Flat Earth debates and and

5386.44 --> 5394.66
all that and just the people that I know

5389.23 --> 5397.33
and like own Benjamin know watch Owen

5394.66 --> 5399.16
Benjamin over glow Buster's every day of

5397.33 --> 5405.76
the week even though glow Buster's is

5399.16 --> 5407.5199999999995
only on on Sundays they got big numbers

5405.76 --> 5411.09
well I don't trust those numbers

5407.52 --> 5414.429
not that I mistrust them necessarily but

5411.09 --> 5417.37
it numbers don't mean anything at this

5414.429 --> 5419.02
point to be the thing that matters is

5417.37 --> 5422.7699999999995
literally life viewers and like

5419.02 --> 5425.290000000001
identical identifiable real people like

5422.77 --> 5427.679
do real people that are actually willing

5425.29 --> 5427.679
to engage

5427.72 --> 5432.37
are they attracted to that or is it just

5430.48 --> 5434.5599999999995
a lot of people that just like to hang

5432.37 --> 5439.68
around and just hear a certain type of

5434.56 --> 5442.6900000000005
stories you know because I have a

5439.68 --> 5446.67
minimum amount of subscribers it's still

5442.69 --> 5451.629999999999
good enough you know I got 1.7 2 K and

5446.67 --> 5455.77
yeah but I get a lot of participation of

5451.63 --> 5458.5
really good people in my chat and that

5455.77 --> 5460.42
at that I have almost I feel like I have

5458.5 --> 5466.93
an advantage over many other channels

5460.42 --> 5469.63
that are much bigger because yeah my

5466.93 --> 5471.67
chat is serious and it's like it's

5469.63 --> 5474.7300000000005
really a part of the show and when you

5471.67 --> 5477.85
enter it you'd automatically kind of

5474.73 --> 5479.86
gain a level of responsibility and that

5477.85 --> 5481.6900000000005
is kind of unusual for show us to do

5479.86 --> 5485.32
that a lot of people literally give up

5481.69 --> 5488.29
on that at some point takes it takes

5485.32 --> 5491.2
away from their plan from the plan of

5488.29 --> 5493.45
this narrative or story or the level

5491.2 --> 5495.58
whatever they want to put out because

5493.45 --> 5497.32
yeah trolls do get in they do get in the

5495.58 --> 5500.11
way and they do take away some of the

5497.32 --> 5502.48
energy and the attention that's the

5500.11 --> 5503.92
natural consequence of doing that but I

5502.48 --> 5506.79
thought it's going to be worth it anyway

5503.92 --> 5509.31
and since I'm gonna have a Daily Show

5506.79 --> 5512.38
I'm gonna need it

5509.31 --> 5514.660000000001
figure that out early on so that's what

5512.38 --> 5516.87
I did and I'm glad that I did because

5514.66 --> 5520.24
now I got a lot of very good

5516.87 --> 5525.4
participants that I can reflect on with

5520.24 --> 5528.34
my ideas and discussions and you can do

5525.4 --> 5534.25
the same with me and that's great I love

5528.34 --> 5538.81
this I love that set up I like it there

5534.25 --> 5540.52
used to be a time when I felt like up

5538.81 --> 5544.18
until like the early early bird days

5540.52 --> 5548.5
where I felt like I don't wanna in a way

5544.18 --> 5551.29
it's like I never have that anymore ever

5548.5 --> 5554.5
no really like even started doing my

5551.29 --> 5555.91
show it builds up a little tension it

5554.5 --> 5558.7
confronts me with things that I don't

5555.91 --> 5560.44
like about myself right sometimes an

5558.7 --> 5562.42
inconvenient moment

5560.44 --> 5565.71
but the show itself and doing it I love

5562.42 --> 5569.92
it I look forward to it every day

5565.71 --> 5571.84
because it does things with me it gives

5569.92 --> 5579.52
me opportunities even in the very moment

5571.84 --> 5583.03
many that I flourish in doing it helps

5579.52 --> 5587.110000000001
me it does a lot of good for me the rest

5583.03 --> 5588.45
of the day so I'm definitely gonna keep

5587.11 --> 5594.5199999999995
doing this

5588.45 --> 5596.95
hmm all right what you see is what you

5594.52 --> 5599.110000000001
get different topics every day it's also

5596.95 --> 5601.57
a good way to kind of keep up-to-date as

5599.11 --> 5603.839999999999
to what's happening in the world and for

5601.57 --> 5607.66
me that to then kind of give my

5603.84 --> 5609.52
recommendation as to how I think in that

5607.66 --> 5612.94
moment like what would be the best

5609.52 --> 5615.55
approach like what should you definitely

5612.94 --> 5617.29
not do what you should keep track of

5615.55 --> 5619.33
that kind of things like my general

5617.29 --> 5624.49
recommendation with whatever the world

5619.33 --> 5626.47
throws at us I do that and yeah it's

5624.49 --> 5629.11
very handy that I have a sort of

5626.47 --> 5633.43
participants in the chat because to be

5629.11 --> 5634.12
fair I'm not like I used to like 10

5633.43 --> 5637.900000000001
years ago

5634.12 --> 5640.57
constantly browsing new sites because in

5637.9 --> 5644.37
a way that also disturbs me because I've

5640.57 --> 5647.799999999999
just come to realize how much of it is

5644.37 --> 5654.07
manipulative garbage and not really as

5647.8 --> 5657.46
reliable as you might think it is like

5654.07 --> 5661.66
half-truths and like the other half you

5657.46 --> 5663.52
don't know which they are at first and

5661.66 --> 5665.5599999999995
now I've discovered like how much of it

5663.52 --> 5669.55
is really fake and then it becomes like

5665.56 --> 5673.84
a burden to sit through that like I

5669.55 --> 5679.66
could not watch CNN I can't

5673.84 --> 5681.79
it would physically hurt me but still

5679.66 --> 5685.03
yeah some people kind of feel they must

5681.79 --> 5688.39
do it it just to keep track of how bad

5685.03 --> 5691.98
it is I don't feel like that I don't

5688.39 --> 5691.9800000000005
feel that's worth my head time

5692.079 --> 5697.219
but yeah I do still have to follow

5694.489 --> 5700.419999999999
people like Alex Jones for reasons I've

5697.219 --> 5703.67
mentioned many times it's not all bad

5700.42 --> 5707.6900000000005
and it's interesting I find him an

5703.67 --> 5709.909
interesting character and yeah so I do

5707.69 --> 5712.699
keep track of some things but not

5709.909 --> 5714.5
everything and especially not everything

5712.699 --> 5717.71
going down with the ballers and all that

5714.5 --> 5721.88
oh yeah I need your I need people that

5717.71 --> 5727.76
are actually willing to engage with

5721.88 --> 5731.84
those absolute freaks because otherwise

5727.76 --> 5734.360000000001
I'd never go there like I may like click

5731.84 --> 5736.969
on Jose's now and then despite

5734.36 --> 5738.619
everything because they're still real

5736.969 --> 5741.32
flat earthers that sometimes get in

5738.619 --> 5745.15
there and though they get like yeah

5741.32 --> 5748.94
kicks in the the paid to kick system now

5745.15 --> 5753.25
but in general I don't like keep track

5748.94 --> 5756.53
of like for to phlearn earth and and

5753.25 --> 5760.849
this is such a list of people I don't

5756.53 --> 5763.46
keep track of them ever never ever but

5760.849 --> 5765.469
it is kind of handy to keep up to date

5763.46 --> 5768.8
as to what they're doing so people that

5765.469 --> 5771.769
are yeah engaging in that I'd really

5768.8 --> 5774.76
like some level of update as long as I

5771.769 --> 5774.76
don't have to do it myself

5777.22 --> 5780.339
[Music]

5781.51 --> 5787.27
alex jones and dave and i two peas in

5784.6 --> 5788.860000000001
the pod I wouldn't say that Jim Jones

5787.27 --> 5793.39
not even close

5788.86 --> 5798.429999999999
no they may have gone in ways for

5793.39 --> 5801.400000000001
similar packages career choices but as

5798.43 --> 5808.72
characters perhaps anything but two peas

5801.4 --> 5810.91
in a pod completely different and yes

5808.72 --> 5817.66
I've actually been a fan of David Icke

5810.91 --> 5823.33
for a long time but in a way he does aim

5817.66 --> 5826.57
for a wider crowd and he keeps things

5823.33 --> 5829.2699999999995
relatively simple and sometimes he drags

5826.57 --> 5831.37
in a little savant a syndrome with with

5829.27 --> 5833.200000000001
reptilians but he rarely does that

5831.37 --> 5834.79
nowadays it's more at the startup that

5833.2 --> 5836.7
was part of his own personal challenge

5834.79 --> 5840.34
and he just grafted it in into his

5836.7 --> 5842.71
concept but he approaches things more

5840.34 --> 5846.79
carefully nowadays and I really do think

5842.71 --> 5848.14
that he's doing a good job concerning

5846.79 --> 5850.66
where he's at

5848.14 --> 5856.84
like what he's got what he's getting

5850.66 --> 5858.49
caught up into and all that so he's

5856.84 --> 5862.6
still a person of interest to me and

5858.49 --> 5876.0599999999995
yeah it's just yeah I like to keep track

5862.6 --> 5876.06
of him as well what really Liat path no

5876.32 --> 5888.5199999999995
oh wait you're not talking about David

5880.13 --> 5888.52
Icke are you talking about your dad okay

5892.52 --> 5899.51
oh come on so when is a routine leading

5896.42 --> 5911.84
to like looking at hands same put oh

5899.51 --> 5914.0
gods he have a really really no no no no

5911.84 --> 5917.75
no no you know what that reptilian thing

5914.0 --> 5920.75
is it's dark world stuff and hey I'm

5917.75 --> 5923.03
pretty damn sure that David Icke has had

5920.75 --> 5926.3
those types of experiences he's been

5923.03 --> 5930.5
with shamans he's undergone extreme

5926.3 --> 5933.4400000000005
visionary transformation and I think

5930.5 --> 5936.62
that the reptilian really is you should

5933.44 --> 5939.32
see it more as spiritually metaphorical

5936.62 --> 5942.74
and that can that's part of the dark

5939.32 --> 5947.78
world it's your imagination becoming

5942.74 --> 5950.929999999999
like a holodeck at times and I think

5947.78 --> 5953.509999999999
that that is if that is what he means

5950.93 --> 5956.66
with this the reptilian it is a spirit

5953.51 --> 5959.4800000000005
and he's he's come to realize that even

5956.66 --> 5961.04
himself over time but it's not how he

5959.48 --> 5963.86
started out he took it everything

5961.04 --> 5966.44
literal hey hello remember our win three

5963.86 --> 5968.63
years ago and my dark wolf visions I

5966.44 --> 5974.2699999999995
thought that - I thought it was a

5968.63 --> 5976.76
literal okay so yeah it sounds very

5974.27 --> 5981.35
familiar to me what he's talking about

5976.76 --> 5984.83
and the reptilians very unlikely to be

5981.35 --> 5986.83
physically literal it's very very

5984.83 --> 5989.97
unlikely

5986.83 --> 5989.97
[Music]

5990.46 --> 5997.07
okay you happy well hey look spiritual

5994.28 --> 5999.489
if you don't believe that then you don't

5997.07 --> 6002.679
understand what that means

5999.489 --> 6005.11
because what is a reptile spirit it's

6002.679 --> 6009.429
just like what do reptiles do in nature

6005.11 --> 6014.829
what are their typical habits well a

6009.429 --> 6017.71
great thing that stands out about them

6014.829 --> 6020.679
is that they don't care for children all

6017.71 --> 6023.199
the children have to survive for

6020.679 --> 6026.469
themselves that's one of the bigger

6023.199 --> 6030.009999999999
things they have no natural care towards

6026.469 --> 6032.26
their own offspring a lot of the times I

6030.01 --> 6036.6990000000005
think most of the times and they're not

6032.26 --> 6039.84
sociable there's no social reptiles so

6036.699 --> 6045.058999999999
that yeah consider that and then

6039.84 --> 6045.059
reconsider what a reptilian really means

6048.3 --> 6051.929
so I think you've been caught up into

6050.829 --> 6058.0199999999995
exoteric

6051.929 --> 6058.02
interpretations taking it too literal

6063.11 --> 6066.74
[Music]

6069.9 --> 6075.389999999999
are still crocodiles that carry their

6072.52 --> 6078.900000000001
offspring from the nest to the water

6075.39 --> 6078.900000000001
okay that's interesting

6086.979 --> 6091.929
all right so maybe it's not completely

6089.38 --> 6095.289
devoid of it's not pure competition

6091.929 --> 6097.3
although yeah like what species could

6095.289 --> 6099.909
survive if they'd literally attack their

6097.3 --> 6105.249
own children you know if they if that's

6099.909 --> 6112.15
just the competition to them so I don't

6105.249 --> 6114.389
know carry them in their mouth yeah

6112.15 --> 6118.719
there's other creatures that do that too

6114.389 --> 6121.599
it's very interesting like the mouth

6118.719 --> 6123.76
becomes like the hiding place for a

6121.599 --> 6126.429
children it's it's bizarre how that

6123.76 --> 6130.030000000001
works it's fascinating to me I think

6126.429 --> 6135.36
there's also like I said there's other

6130.03 --> 6135.36
creatures that do that to sea creatures

6137.369 --> 6144.07
but yeah you know if a creature is

6140.65 --> 6148.119
relatively large and your offspring is

6144.07 --> 6150.999
incredibly small if the instincts could

6148.119 --> 6154.839999999999
be controlled to know that yeah then you

6150.999 --> 6156.579
could do that you know what carry em in

6154.84 --> 6158.1990000000005
your mouth if you absolutely are

6156.579 --> 6161.018999999999
conscious of what you're doing and you

6158.199 --> 6171.308999999999
can do it safely it's a very safe closed

6161.019 --> 6175.209
off place so why not but in general they

6171.309 --> 6179.4400000000005
are not social animals reptiles most of

6175.209 --> 6182.59
them are completely solitary and they

6179.44 --> 6185.32
lay eggs and then just yeah bury them

6182.59 --> 6187.709
whatever and then they leave Turtles do

6185.32 --> 6187.709
that too

6199.179 --> 6205.689
any fish right yeah fish do that a lot

6202.42 --> 6209.65
of fish do it too it's logical because

6205.689 --> 6213.159000000001
most fish have fish eggs are always much

6209.65 --> 6216.15
much smaller than what the creature

6213.159 --> 6216.15
eventually becomes

6221.83 --> 6227.41
it's like unlike Burt types because bird

6224.56 --> 6235.360000000001
types usually lay eggs that are much

6227.41 --> 6238.3
bigger in relation to fish eggs and I

6235.36 --> 6241.11
think reptiles to reptile eggs are

6238.3 --> 6243.67
usually a lot smaller in relation to the

6241.11 --> 6246.82
animal size but that's also because

6243.67 --> 6248.68
reptiles I think if given enough time in

6246.82 --> 6250.48
the proper and food and all that can

6248.68 --> 6255.610000000001
basically keep on growing forever

6250.48 --> 6258.45
potentially no I don't have facebook i

6255.61 --> 6263.65
never had facebook and it never will

6258.45 --> 6268.599999999999
never not even a triad in retrospect I'm

6263.65 --> 6272.17
kind of proud of it but if you want to

6268.6 --> 6273.97
share my video on your Facebook then by

6272.17 --> 6277.15
all means you know share on any platform

6273.97 --> 6280.75
II deemed fit but I'm not gonna do it

6277.15 --> 6285.82
I'm not gonna go on Facebook really you

6280.75 --> 6288.94
do do you get any views I'd love to hear

6285.82 --> 6291.13
about that I have no idea well by now is

6288.94 --> 6294.49
looking I don't know how many people

6291.13 --> 6297.3
follow me you know not because probably

6294.49 --> 6300.61
especially if videos are embedded on

6297.3 --> 6302.95
platforms which is possible with my

6300.61 --> 6305.0199999999995
videos to specifically know that that

6302.95 --> 6307.75
you can do that because you can disable

6305.02 --> 6309.64
that that you have if you disable then

6307.75 --> 6312.28
you must go to my youtube channel in

6309.64 --> 6314.9800000000005
order to watch the video but yeah

6312.28 --> 6317.65
because it is embeddable theirs might be

6314.98 --> 6319.8099999999995
a lot of people watching that don't go

6317.65 --> 6321.82
to my youtube and then enter my chat i

6319.81 --> 6324.75
don't know how many people watch me i

6321.82 --> 6324.75
have no idea

6332.6 --> 6338.46
facial we have the facial recognition

6334.949 --> 6340.259999999999
thing I know it's terrible I caught that

6338.46 --> 6342.36
caught my eye pretty early on it's like

6340.26 --> 6344.04
every time you put a photo on it there's

6342.36 --> 6346.739
like this automated face recognition

6344.04 --> 6349.56
it's like oh this person is on Facebook

6346.739 --> 6351.69
that this person is on Facebook and I

6349.56 --> 6358.110000000001
guess it is kind of handy for quick

6351.69 --> 6360.12
socializing but yeah that made me feel

6358.11 --> 6363.449
very uncomfortable and at that time I

6360.12 --> 6366.42
was still very paranoid you know Alex

6363.449 --> 6368.4
Jones was also talking about like social

6366.42 --> 6371.4890000000005
credit score in the future and like yeah

6368.4 --> 6374.82
that's all gonna eventually basically be

6371.489 --> 6378.0
the thing the information to arrest you

6374.82 --> 6380.639999999999
and in many ways that has happened so

6378.0 --> 6384.87
Facebook has been used in many countries

6380.64 --> 6387.12
to basically yeah make people do

6384.87 --> 6389.9
something incredibly stupid posted on

6387.12 --> 6393.03
Facebook and then they get arrested this

6389.9 --> 6396.15
that has happened a lot of the times oh

6393.03 --> 6398.009999999999
by the way Thank You Amanda um for the

6396.15 --> 6400.469
five dollar super cheddar nation I love

6403.25 --> 6409.67
you spoil me girl but I like that reefer

6414.429 --> 6422.26
yeah nice nice another 20 euros very

6418.989 --> 6424.449
generous very very generous thank you so

6422.26 --> 6437.469
much Amanda young for the 20 euros super

6424.449 --> 6440.739
jet donation well I call together I like

6437.469 --> 6443.679
this weekend that's a pretty substantial

6440.739 --> 6447.19
amount then I'm probably gonna get

6443.679 --> 6451.03
Monday or Tuesday or something I'm gonna

6447.19 --> 6455.889999999999
need it but thank you so much that's

6451.03 --> 6461.4
really awesome oh wow if I'll be almost

6455.89 --> 6461.400000000001
two hours how the time is flown

6471.5 --> 6477.28
Apple fleshlight app what's that never

6474.98 --> 6477.28
heard of that

6487.219 --> 6492.26
yeah the trolls have full shut up mostly

6489.83 --> 6507.94
oh there were some but I quickly banned

6492.26 --> 6507.9400000000005
them why would you need an Xbox 360

6548.369 --> 6557.049999999999
what Wow

6553.019 --> 6559.570000000001
there was this flashlight that needed

6557.05 --> 6566.039
access to your photos and friends list

6559.57 --> 6569.259999999999
of work that is like the grab ler

6566.039 --> 6573.309
abscissa flashlight oh it's so relevant

6569.26 --> 6579.820000000001
that we need of this info what yeah

6573.309 --> 6581.709
that's just it's too much well there's a

6579.82 --> 6584.499
lot of kids that they'll just do that

6581.709 --> 6586.979
just like that and that's what they're

6584.499 --> 6586.978999999999
counting on

6587.34 --> 6599.709
it's more metadata harvesting to improve

6596.409 --> 6601.808999999999
upon the platform not to basically

6599.709 --> 6606.219
figure out people more and more in order

6601.809 --> 6608.110000000001
to I don't know go to them in the

6606.219 --> 6610.209
specific direction using that

6608.11 --> 6614.07
information with your grab Li plans

6610.209 --> 6614.07
Facebook hmm

6630.369 --> 6637.869
all right Hana koala well to be fair

6633.369 --> 6640.539
Facebook has been like that for ten

6637.869 --> 6642.61
years has been like that for a long time

6640.539 --> 6647.429
they were very early on with being very

6642.61 --> 6650.679
creepy and invasive like a lot of other

6647.429 --> 6655.959
companies are kind of like followed

6650.679 --> 6657.969
doings that Direction type of uh I mean

6655.959 --> 6661.03
yeah they're doing the same kind of

6657.969 --> 6664.719
thing but Facebook was very early with

6661.03 --> 6670.898999999999
being that invasive at the time like

6664.719 --> 6673.329
they would even yeah risk like judicial

6670.899 --> 6676.979
situations over that but Facebook has

6673.329 --> 6681.489
been very evasive very early on very

6676.979 --> 6683.26
persistently and it's one of the reasons

6681.489 --> 6690.218999999999
why I just didn't want to have anything

6683.26 --> 6694.059
to do with it yeah you pay and buy your

6690.219 --> 6699.4890000000005
own tracking device yeah well that's

6694.059 --> 6701.559
what like iPhones and and such are to me

6699.489 --> 6707.018999999999
that's literally what they've been to me

6701.559 --> 6711.189
always and I've seen other people living

6707.019 --> 6718.659000000001
with their phone and realized that it is

6711.189 --> 6720.879
absolutely true because it's like they

6718.659 --> 6724.089999999999
make you dependent on it they give you

6720.879 --> 6726.01
very all kinds of convenience you become

6724.09 --> 6729.639
dependent on it and then you will

6726.01 --> 6732.070000000001
exchange your metadata because of the

6729.639 --> 6734.26
convenience that you're you've become

6732.07 --> 6738.188999999999
dependent on don't want to let go of

6734.26 --> 6740.1990000000005
that so it's like a sacrifice you will

6738.189 --> 6743.649
eventually make because it's just so

6740.199 --> 6747.959
handy it's just so handy can do without

6743.649 --> 6747.959000000001
it right

6752.84 --> 6760.79
well I don't like to do that I'd like to

6756.8 --> 6765.05
not get dependent on such devices in any

6760.79 --> 6767.87
way besides I have a personal distaste

6765.05 --> 6770.78
for the entire system I don't like small

6767.87 --> 6774.43
screens I don't like touch screens at

6770.78 --> 6774.429999999999
all at all

6794.659 --> 6799.768999999999
kappa it's not about being tracked it's

6797.399 --> 6802.9490000000005
not even about your specific location it

6799.769 --> 6806.099
is about metadata it is about giving

6802.949 --> 6810.178999999999
them enough data about what you're doing

6806.099 --> 6812.929
in order for them to calculate you out

6810.179 --> 6815.88
to figure you out on a level that you

6812.929 --> 6818.519
can't even figure out about yourself

6815.88 --> 6823.309
that's what they do with it

6818.519 --> 6826.979
do you understand the algorithms that

6823.309 --> 6833.070000000001
deal with these kind of statistics and

6826.979 --> 6836.039000000001
the metadata are much better at figuring

6833.07 --> 6839.219
out exactly what people are gonna do

6836.039 --> 6841.438999999999
then people themselves a lot better and

6839.219 --> 6844.769
that was kind of known pretty early on

6841.439 --> 6849.929
that that was happening in a way Google

6844.769 --> 6851.88
is doing the same thing they do it with

6849.929 --> 6854.209
the data that they collect from your

6851.88 --> 6858.749
searches know that they figure you out

6854.209 --> 6861.209
the problem is that they also with that

6858.749 --> 6864.78
it doesn't just help you to find what

6861.209 --> 6866.849
you want to find it also kind of wants

6864.78 --> 6869.398999999999
to nudge you into certain directions

6866.849 --> 6874.829
because it's just been ordered to do

6869.399 --> 6876.599
that they wouldn't need to be like that

6874.829 --> 6879.768999999999
but it became like that when they

6876.599 --> 6879.769
corrupted the algorithm

6894.0 --> 6897.079
[Music]

6902.12 --> 6908.3
[Music]

6905.3 --> 6908.3
right

6915.119 --> 6919.67
yeah that's what all boomers say have

6919.73 --> 6931.44
unfortunately reality proves the

6922.29 --> 6933.36
contrary the thing is about notching you

6931.44 --> 6938.57
in a direction is that when it happens

6933.36 --> 6938.57
you don't see it a lot of the times

6947.04 --> 6952.41
like I am being nudged in all kinds of

6949.92 --> 6955.35
directions and even with everything my

6952.41 --> 6960.0
sharpness I can feel that I am but I

6955.35 --> 6962.7300000000005
don't see yet how I don't fully

6960.0 --> 6965.91
understand like what my designation is

6962.73 --> 6966.24
within the algorithm I don't understand

6965.91 --> 6968.49
it

6966.24 --> 6972.48
it's not that straightforward it's not

6968.49 --> 6976.349999999999
like it's literally attacking me or

6972.48 --> 6978.69
anything sometimes I feel it's it's

6976.35 --> 6981.27
really genuinely trying to help me even

6978.69 --> 6983.49
but at the same time it can't help but

6981.27 --> 6985.38
try to push certain political views on

6983.49 --> 6990.09
it is sometimes just trying to turn me

6985.38 --> 6996.3
into Sivan yay but not always sometimes

6990.09 --> 6997.89
is really helpful so it's a I got a bit

6996.3 --> 7002.45
of a mixed relation with the Google

6997.89 --> 7007.490000000001
algorithm one thing that I am very

7002.45 --> 7012.04
disappointed at however is how bad the

7007.49 --> 7015.469999999999
search system has become like Google is

7012.04 --> 7019.5199999999995
not good anymore to really find

7015.47 --> 7021.71
information the information finding

7019.52 --> 7024.02
aspect has become highly politicized

7021.71 --> 7026.51
highly and it's sometimes just is

7024.02 --> 7029.42
impossible to find things if you don't

7026.51 --> 7032.66
already know where to search and yeah

7029.42 --> 7035.81
I'm not a master at searching things on

7032.66 --> 7039.41
the internet there was a period that I

7035.81 --> 7042.320000000001
was relatively good at it in a certain

7039.41 --> 7046.599999999999
direction but not so much anymore things

7042.32 --> 7046.599999999999
have changed a lot in 10 years

7047.939 --> 7054.360000000001
right anyway guys it's it's been a

7051.769 --> 7056.849
interesting conversation but I got a got

7054.36 --> 7059.07
a round out the show it's been two hours

7056.849 --> 7066.419
and I'm getting kind of hungry and you

7059.07 --> 7071.209
totally break also you're in the country

7066.419 --> 7075.869
of Finnmark what's that it's at Finland

7071.209 --> 7081.469
Denmark I don't know why st. mark said

7075.869 --> 7081.469
if that's not a country now County right

7082.489 --> 7091.829
