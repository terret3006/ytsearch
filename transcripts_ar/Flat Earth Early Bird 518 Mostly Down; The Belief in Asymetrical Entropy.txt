Friday morning afternoon weather today

90.729 --> 96.69
is beautiful again I heard some people

93.34 --> 104.35000000000001
say it's gonna rain tomorrow well no

96.69 --> 110.41
just no look at that it's warm it's a

104.35 --> 113.67999999999999
little bit more windy but it's yeah it's

110.41 --> 115.84
it's great still there is some camp

113.68 --> 117.45
trail activity I've even noticed that

115.84 --> 124.42
like in the evening yesterday

117.45 --> 126.43
it's that yeah some of these lines keep

124.42 --> 129.97
hanging around for a very long time and

126.43 --> 132.76000000000002
it spread out into the typical yeah

129.97 --> 136.42
striped like cloud formation that would

132.76 --> 142.06
go pretty wide and yet so there is me

136.42 --> 145.29899999999998
there is some kind of stray I don't know

142.06 --> 148.209
what it is you know it could simply be

145.299 --> 154.0
to just try to help create more clouds

148.209 --> 156.64000000000001
in order to initiate rainfall but I

154.0 --> 159.87
don't know know for sure I just noticed

156.64 --> 159.86999999999998
what I can see

161.51 --> 170.06
so morning everyone I got to Myra coffee

180.26 --> 190.19
first prank yeah he apparently WikiLeaks

184.849 --> 192.07899999999998
has put out a lot of content according

190.19 --> 197.69
to him there live yeah it must have

192.079 --> 200.56900000000002
happened recently I don't know why maybe

197.69 --> 203.239
in relation to deep state situations you

200.569 --> 204.07899999999998
know it's very tough to figure out what

203.239 --> 207.29
it's all for

204.079 --> 209.75
at this point anyway thanks for that

207.29 --> 219.85899999999998

235.459 --> 240.7
yeah I think I got everyone good morning

238.159 --> 240.7
to you all

244.18 --> 252.95000000000002
like and flouting all right yeah I I've

251.269 --> 255.159
been taking it kind of easy this morning

252.95 --> 255.159
again

264.889 --> 267.55
all right

276.34 --> 282.67999999999995
yeah I've mostly remembered this warning

279.68 --> 286.73
morning watching I'm getting more emails

282.68 --> 287.74
these days from from bears and people in

286.73 --> 292.07
chat

287.74 --> 295.52
Robin Stanley and me and and we have

292.07 --> 302.27
Robin Stanley forward this video about

295.52 --> 305.93
this designer flexible garden house it's

302.27 --> 309.139
like it's very interesting I've seen

305.93 --> 311.12
that before but yes in the Netherlands

309.139 --> 315.44
actually yeah but I'm absolutely certain

311.12 --> 317.36
I've seen that before that thing but it

315.44 --> 320.9
is interesting how they design it does

317.36 --> 322.58000000000004
make me think like oh yeah I would want

320.9 --> 325.7
something like that maybe slightly

322.58 --> 327.59
different the thing is beautiful like a

325.7 --> 330.8
design oddity it's pretty well thought

327.59 --> 332.78
out so thank you for that Robin Stanley

330.8 --> 336.229
yeah yeah it's nice to get some emails

332.78 --> 339.40999999999997
you know I guess I kind of hope to get

336.229 --> 340.94
this or the thing through Skype if you

339.41 --> 342.97
want to email me one on one I'm

340.94 --> 347.66
perfectly fine with that as well

342.97 --> 349.97
and yeah if you're going to be a troll

347.66 --> 352.07000000000005
about it then I'm just gonna yeah ignore

349.97 --> 359.26000000000005
it because I've had some troll emails as

352.07 --> 359.26
well although mostly on patreon is weird

360.039 --> 365.93
and there's just people I guess that

362.75 --> 370.01
just really can't handle the idea that a

365.93 --> 373.07
guy like me with yeah everything that I

370.01 --> 375.32
do and don't do and my open and honesty

373.07 --> 379.21999999999997
about it they just can't handle it that

375.32 --> 381.65
people like us get funding on a

379.22 --> 385.34000000000003
voluntary basis from people I think they

381.65 --> 388.82
just can't handle it there are some

385.34 --> 392.51
other individuals out there that yeah

388.82 --> 394.99
that have this in particular so somebody

392.51 --> 398.27
yesterday I had a meek and pointed

394.99 --> 400.43
pointed me to the fact that yesterday

398.27 --> 405.14
apparently somebody had been dual

400.43 --> 407.21
streaming my stream particular

405.14 --> 413.57
individual that I find extreme

407.21 --> 416.81
unpleasant and pretty disgusting he's a

413.57 --> 419.93
guy that was on the scene kind of early

416.81 --> 423.289
in the Antonio super rats crowd names

419.93 --> 427.22
Vinny and he's Dutch and he's a pretty

423.289 --> 432.259
repulsive character in every conceivable

427.22 --> 435.53000000000003
way that I can think of and I don't know

432.259 --> 439.25
he hates me it really does and he loves

435.53 --> 441.08
he's like a baller and he acted early on

439.25 --> 445.789
like he kind of was a flat earther but

441.08 --> 450.229
he's not he really isn't it's a very

445.789 --> 454.15999999999997
creepy dude and he no I guess he spends

450.229 --> 457.52
all his time just being a complete state

454.16 --> 460.84900000000005
is dick and Sivan yay towards everyone

457.52 --> 464.81
that comes on on his path that that

460.849 --> 469.58
basically doesn't auto [ __ ] he attacks

464.81 --> 472.07
people that don't auto [ __ ] like that so

469.58 --> 474.289
yeah nobody here ever heard of him well

472.07 --> 476.27
be glad of it you don't want to I'm not

474.289 --> 480.139
even gonna tell you where to find him

476.27 --> 483.10999999999996
it's it's like more worth watching Simon

480.139 --> 485.449
than videos than this guy I'm serious

483.11 --> 488.11
and you all know how watching Simon 10

485.449 --> 488.11
videos is

494.77 --> 506.9
okay flat ball yeah sure

497.24 --> 508.88
I know the weird thing was it is tech he

506.9 --> 510.44
is technically if he does this thing

508.88 --> 513.77
especially those more often he's cop

510.44 --> 516.65
right a copywriting me because my show

513.77 --> 518.4789999999999
my youtube show is a YouTube exclusive

516.65 --> 520.669
that's how it is set

518.479 --> 524.99
it's how I set it from the very first

520.669 --> 529.16
start so technically nobody is allowed

524.99 --> 533.21
to just copy/paste my stream because it

529.16 --> 536.0899999999999
is registered as unique content of unit

533.21 --> 538.4000000000001
of YouTube so nobody out there it

536.09 --> 538.9100000000001
technically is allowed to just copy my

538.4 --> 541.16
[ __ ]

538.91 --> 543.3199999999999
now if they have specific in-depth

541.16 --> 546.4399999999999
criticism and they have like play

543.32 --> 548.12
something that I do put it a pause and

546.44 --> 549.9200000000001
then say their thing about it can be

548.12 --> 553.4
ridiculous you know that's fine if they

549.92 --> 559.0699999999999
want to do that but just playing my

553.4 --> 562.4
entire stream just like that no but yeah

559.07 --> 564.62
when I try to copyright it you know

562.4 --> 567.4399999999999
because did yeah that isn't what it is

564.62 --> 569.33
it's not even like who is bullying me or

567.44 --> 572.7800000000001
so no it's just literally copywriting

569.33 --> 573.7700000000001
when I try to do that it was practically

572.78 --> 575.9
impossible

573.77 --> 578.15
it was insane I had to fill in like this

575.9 --> 579.53
bigger list with all kinds of nonsense

578.15 --> 582.9499999999999
and references things that I've never

579.53 --> 586.1899999999999
even heard of like what what so now you

582.95 --> 589.6
can't do that unless you have a lawyer

586.19 --> 594.71
or something what the hell is this

589.6 --> 598.91
so I guess YouTube's now pretty much

594.71 --> 600.6500000000001
gave the all the content to everyone who

598.91 --> 601.9399999999999
do who wants to do whatever with it

600.65 --> 604.01
because it's becoming extremely

601.94 --> 608.0300000000001
difficult to just properly copyright

604.01 --> 609.83
claim something unless you're very in

608.03 --> 612.26
the know of how that all works

609.83 --> 614.63
I've never effectively did a copyright

612.26 --> 620.9
strike I just would say like no this is

614.63 --> 623.93
I don't get permission it used to be

620.9 --> 627.55
kind of that simple and now it's not

623.93 --> 627.55
very surprised about that

630.94 --> 636.3800000000001
but yeah that technically that doesn't

633.769 --> 639.829
stop others from going over to that

636.38 --> 644.66
stream and then during their own

639.829 --> 647.5089999999999
reporting about it everyone information

644.66 --> 650.6899999999999
to do that but hey if anybody wants to

647.509 --> 652.16
try to report me I wish you the best of

650.69 --> 653.99
luck you know it's not like if people

652.16 --> 655.79
haven't tried like for example Brenda

653.99 --> 660.319
they'll try anything report anything

655.79 --> 662.24
well it's not gonna work because even

660.319 --> 666.68
when I do bring up a subject that's

662.24 --> 672.44
highly controversial subjects in that

666.68 --> 675.68
what because even when I bring up

672.44 --> 677.9300000000001
subjects I do it very much responsible

675.68 --> 680.12
and if I say something extreme I make it

677.93 --> 685.4899999999999
very clear that that is about my feeling

680.12 --> 688.3100000000001
and that I usually don't recommend other

685.49 --> 691.939
people to literally do such a thing so

688.31 --> 697.79
yet doesn't work and that's why I have

691.939 --> 700.2199999999999
zero zero copyright strikes zero not a

697.79 --> 705.439
single one not ever I haven't had

700.22 --> 707.899
anything I've had like D monetizing

705.439 --> 713.66
stuff and they've taken down videos

707.899 --> 716.569
because it's like the the yeah with with

713.66 --> 719.87
shootings and such highly controversial

716.569 --> 721.639
shootings in specific locations those if

719.87 --> 724.25
you talk about that at the time then

721.639 --> 725.66
yeah your video may be taken down at

724.25 --> 728.63
least that's what I've experienced but

725.66 --> 732.86
I've never been I've never truly

728.63 --> 738.42
received a strike kind of happy about

732.86 --> 742.74
that too but yeah

738.42 --> 747.66
I am surprised about it anyway like did

742.74 --> 750.3
did I do that good job have I been as

747.66 --> 752.67
effectively careful as I hoped I would

750.3 --> 756.209
be that I just haven't received any kind

752.67 --> 759.5999999999999
of strike at all I don't know it's it's

756.209 --> 763.4399999999999
kind of odd in a way I wish almost I had

759.6 --> 766.41
like a liaison from YouTube like

763.44 --> 769.589
somebody from YouTube that could be like

766.41 --> 774.4499999999999
an informant as to like how well you're

769.589 --> 777.69
doing and what you could risk what you

774.45 --> 783.26
couldn't risk like an advisor I'm not

777.69 --> 783.2600000000001
trying hard enough James Mason really

784.279 --> 789.54
maybe they're just maybe they just get

787.32 --> 791.13
it you know strike me down and I'll

789.54 --> 797.0699999999999
become more powerful than you can ever

791.13 --> 800.37
imagine you know that is in a way that

797.07 --> 803.149
is effective and it has been effective

800.37 --> 803.149
on other people too

803.209 --> 808.4699999999999
it's like the people that do get the

805.769 --> 810.089
strikes typically do seem like they're

808.47 --> 818.3100000000001
just getting more fired up and

810.089 --> 826.0500000000001
aggressive look if I'd get strikes then

818.31 --> 829.3499999999999
I just be very annoyed if I get strike

826.05 --> 831.6899999999999
I'd probably yeah drop you to pretty

829.35 --> 833.88
quickly that that's also a natural

831.69 --> 836.94
consequent because even though my

833.88 --> 840.18
channel has been treated decently I

836.94 --> 842.1
guess it's not exactly like I'm happy

840.18 --> 845.9399999999999
with what YouTube has been up to in the

842.1 --> 849.029
last few years and how they've behaved

845.94 --> 853.1600000000001
and allowed total politicization of

849.029 --> 853.16
subjects and all that so

853.58 --> 859.63
yeah but for now I'm just gonna keep on

856.91 --> 859.63
going right here

866.98 --> 875.4490000000001
all right so yeah you might have taken

869.449 --> 877.579
notice of the title mostly down did

875.449 --> 880.519
anybody catch that yesterday on the flat

877.579 --> 884.3889999999999
earth debates was freakin amazing

880.519 --> 892.389
I think it was zanuck that brought that

884.389 --> 899.48
forth it just it made me laugh because

892.389 --> 902.089
it's like this frolic II it feels kind

899.48 --> 904.85
of frolic it mostly down it's so

902.089 --> 907.2790000000001
ridiculous and silly and it's like they

904.85 --> 909.62
can t try to conjure that it's like a

907.279 --> 912.769
funny thing that almost has right of

909.62 --> 915.019
existence because it is so funny even

912.769 --> 918.529
though it's absolutely blatantly wrong

915.019 --> 921.7090000000001
and ridiculous it should be apparent to

918.529 --> 930.35
anyone that has yeah it's halfway

921.709 --> 933.2299999999999
informed about physics so I don't know

930.35 --> 935.3000000000001
if I can talk about it a lot like why it

933.23 --> 937.4490000000001
is ridiculous but I just thought it was

935.3 --> 940.79
so funny that I I said I would

937.449 --> 944.529
definitely name my hangout today after

940.79 --> 947.7199999999999
it because it's that funny mostly down

944.529 --> 949.79
yeah because what is the consequence of

947.72 --> 953.629
gas expanding not in all directions

949.79 --> 956.269
equally but mostly down as he yes he

953.629 --> 958.5500000000001
kept on in forwarding now well that

956.269 --> 962.269
would mean that there is some asymmetry

958.55 --> 966.17
to the way that entropy functions okay

962.269 --> 969.5
mostly down like not equally in all

966.17 --> 973.069
directions that means asymmetry in in a

969.5 --> 975.949
natural effect in in natural in the way

973.069 --> 982.329
natural law applies itself the how

975.949 --> 988.87
bizarre is that that the way heat

982.329 --> 991.7589999999999
transfer happens or he transition

988.87 --> 996.03
expansion in all directions of gas and

991.759 --> 999.69
gases that that would not go equal

996.03 --> 1001.8199999999999
like it's more this way okay so what if

999.69 --> 1005.1800000000001
gas would be going mostly down

1001.82 --> 1007.5500000000001
technically it's not but what if well if

1005.18 --> 1009.9499999999999
that were the case with gas expanding

1007.55 --> 1012.7099999999999
more downward than upward well that

1009.95 --> 1017.96
would mean that the same thing would go

1012.71 --> 1020.0
for heat that would mean that heat would

1017.96 --> 1022.97
yeah because if it is with gas by

1020.0 --> 1025.1
expansion then it must also be with heat

1022.97 --> 1026.78
transfer so what would be the

1025.1 --> 1034.6299999999999
consequence it would mean that heat

1026.78 --> 1038.06
would transfer more slowly upward and

1034.63 --> 1043.0700000000002
also the other cold would displace

1038.06 --> 1044.6299999999999
downward more slowly and yeah except for

1043.07 --> 1048.29
yeah the other way around

1044.63 --> 1051.38
if it was on top then it would go

1048.29 --> 1054.83
quicker downward and cold would more go

1051.38 --> 1056.3000000000002
more slow upward it I don't know does

1054.83 --> 1060.1699999999998
that make any sense maybe this is just

1056.3 --> 1062.45
too nonsensical to even ponder upon it's

1060.17 --> 1065.38
just that yeah I don't know when

1062.45 --> 1069.02
somebody brings up such a giant

1065.38 --> 1072.65
world-changing conception asymmetrical

1069.02 --> 1074.45
entropy it just makes me shocks me in

1072.65 --> 1076.64
the position for a moan and I'm like

1074.45 --> 1079.28
whoa I've never even seen this type of

1076.64 --> 1081.7700000000002
Legos before you know that's right it's

1079.28 --> 1085.25
like oh this is the new Legos

1081.77 --> 1091.4
it's funny what can I do with this yeah

1085.25 --> 1093.71
so that's mostly down but yeah it's

1091.4 --> 1096.77
nonsensical because gas pressure expands

1093.71 --> 1100.8500000000001
in all directions equally and yeah

1096.77 --> 1106.16
besides that natural effect it's not the

1100.85 --> 1108.9199999999998
only thing that motions gas because

1106.16 --> 1111.53
there's also relative density first the

1108.92 --> 1113.3300000000002
gas expands in all directions until it

1111.53 --> 1115.28
meets the walls of the container then

1113.33 --> 1117.26
the gas finds an equilibrium then

1115.28 --> 1119.93
relative density gets a chance to

1117.26 --> 1122.81
basically set in as the rapid expansion

1119.93 --> 1125.39
has halted because of the equilibrium

1122.81 --> 1127.98
and then relative density will gradually

1125.39 --> 1131.4
set in if it is given the chance

1127.98 --> 1134.76
the dynamic system it does not have much

1131.4 --> 1138.6000000000001
chance then yeah the entire content of

1134.76 --> 1142.3799999999999
the container gas and all of it will

1138.6 --> 1144.9599999999998
start to yeah become affected by

1142.38 --> 1149.22
relative density and the densities will

1144.96 --> 1152.69
settle in their respective part of the

1149.22 --> 1157.3700000000001
spectrum of relative density and

1152.69 --> 1160.0800000000002
therefore the gradient will also arrive

1157.37 --> 1163.8899999999999
it's not mostly down it's just the way

1160.08 --> 1165.96
things settle eventually you know the

1163.89 --> 1167.8500000000001
gas pressure going in all directions is

1165.96 --> 1174.919
not about the settling no it's about

1167.85 --> 1180.03
filling the container and then and then

1174.919 --> 1182.5490000000002
gradients happen after after the the the

1180.03 --> 1184.6499999999999
container has been filled that is when

1182.549 --> 1203.01
other effects start to affect the

1184.65 --> 1207.3300000000002
content well lies exposed that

1203.01 --> 1210.15
technically gas pressure expands equally

1207.33 --> 1213.96
proof proofs gravity as described is a

1210.15 --> 1219.3600000000001
hoax well technically that's not even

1213.96 --> 1223.14
true because gravity even though how it

1219.36 --> 1225.2099999999998
is explained is not correct gravity the

1223.14 --> 1229.2
effect is basically what comes forth

1225.21 --> 1231.54
from relative density and yeah the

1229.2 --> 1233.91
descriptions it still does work it just

1231.54 --> 1236.58
doesn't work in the outer open space

1233.91 --> 1237.179
that doesn't exist still in the

1236.58 --> 1238.5
container

1237.179 --> 1242.049
you know if the container is there then

1238.5 --> 1246.65
it all kind of works out works out fine

1242.049 --> 1251.24
little G is it's an effect it's not a

1246.65 --> 1254.77
force but yeah it is there though that

1251.24 --> 1254.77
is something that does happen

1255.01 --> 1263.059
effectively it's just not a force its

1260.03 --> 1274.57
what naturally happens due to relative

1263.059 --> 1274.57
density right

1278.67 --> 1281.8690000000001
[Music]

1285.66 --> 1290.39
this is okay we okey that's that's funny

1289.5 --> 1293.01
one

1290.39 --> 1294.63
if gravity wasn't real how would

1293.01 --> 1297.44
chickens know how to lay their eggs

1294.63 --> 1297.44
downward

1301.98 --> 1305.079
[Music]

1313.34 --> 1316.4499999999998
[Music]

1341.53 --> 1345.059
yeah I know Sounders off

1354.06 --> 1363.81
hey is chat stuck yeah

1358.54 --> 1363.81
dad is stuck let me fix that

1379.71 --> 1382.67
okay

1388.33 --> 1399.4299999999998
mmm chickens chickens are awesome

1393.75 --> 1399.43
[Music]

1400.049 --> 1407.8799999999999
hello good servant sorry taco Santino

1405.429 --> 1407.88
what is it

1424.49 --> 1431.32
camping and fishing huh

1428.83 --> 1433.24
or if you can find a good place where

1431.32 --> 1437.1
you can fish and where it's actually

1433.24 --> 1440.08
safety then proceed to eat that fish

1437.1 --> 1442.3799999999999
yeah that's that's always a good

1440.08 --> 1442.3799999999999
experience

1452.16 --> 1456.8400000000001
not indeed George Sanford yeah and if

1454.95 --> 1458.94
you do things right if you manage your

1456.84 --> 1460.6799999999998
chickens correctly then they're more

1458.94 --> 1462.51
than just a renewable food source

1460.68 --> 1466.1100000000001
they're they can also be partial

1462.51 --> 1469.56
caretaker of your of your garden now

1466.11 --> 1472.53
this is how like the high grade organic

1469.56 --> 1475.1299999999999
farm situations are handled like the

1472.53 --> 1477.84
chickens walk around in everything and

1475.13 --> 1479.3700000000001
they figure it out they can tell you

1477.84 --> 1480.87
exactly what the chickens are

1479.37 --> 1486.06
effectively doing and how they're

1480.87 --> 1489.1999999999998
contributing to the rest it's a system

1486.06 --> 1489.2
that I find extremely fascinating

1499.6 --> 1508.06
yeah little red Priestley you're all

1504.37 --> 1510.6699999999998
right go to bed yeah it is night in

1508.06 --> 1512.73
Australia that's right okay have a good

1510.67 --> 1512.73
night

1523.44 --> 1529.8700000000001
yeah

1524.94 --> 1537.0700000000002
dodgy D 101 it wasted time debating

1529.87 --> 1540.52
globe heads well not not entirely you

1537.07 --> 1542.95
know it's there just there on the losing

1540.52 --> 1546.04
side and they're desperate but they

1542.95 --> 1549.13
still try you know they they test our

1546.04 --> 1552.04
armor they they test our resolve and

1549.13 --> 1554.7700000000002
that is still why it is still amusing

1552.04 --> 1558.07
and worthwhile in my opinion to hang

1554.77 --> 1560.47
around at the Flat Earth debates because

1558.07 --> 1564.97
of the testing because yeah what good is

1560.47 --> 1567.55
any armor if you have no if nobody

1564.97 --> 1570.7
actually tries anything you know then it

1567.55 --> 1573.49
just becomes this very weighty thing the

1570.7 --> 1575.02
thing you have to haul around if it's

1573.49 --> 1578.61
constantly being tested yeah you're very

1575.02 --> 1578.61
happy you're gonna have that armor

1580.17 --> 1586.27
that's kind of how I see the Flat Earth

1582.91 --> 1589.8000000000002
knowledge that I've gathered and and the

1586.27 --> 1589.8
debate technicals

1591.91 --> 1602.9
it's in a way I think that in a way it's

1599.78 --> 1605.87
almost more effective learning about

1602.9 --> 1608.0300000000002
physics and all that through through

1605.87 --> 1609.3799999999999
what I'm doing here and being on the

1608.03 --> 1611.3
Flat Earth debate and being in this

1609.38 --> 1618.0800000000002
community up against the ballers than it

1611.3 --> 1623.0
ever was ever on at school because at

1618.08 --> 1625.6899999999998
school ya dissenting opinions like Flat

1623.0 --> 1631.6
Earth and all that were not allowed

1625.69 --> 1636.44
really it's like if you had yeah

1631.6 --> 1638.6299999999999
oppositional tendencies in arguments

1636.44 --> 1640.49
then that could be kind of appreciate

1638.63 --> 1643.88
but it but like forbidden knowledge was

1640.49 --> 1646.88
just not allowed well now here it is

1643.88 --> 1648.92
really allowed to just be and go

1646.88 --> 1650.99
honestly up against one another and that

1648.92 --> 1655.76
is kind of a unique opportunity compared

1650.99 --> 1660.34
to what I went through at school and so

1655.76 --> 1664.19
I think it is also more effective at

1660.34 --> 1669.02
teaching physics in this natural format

1664.19 --> 1672.67
I think people learn more this way they

1669.02 --> 1672.67
get more invested in this

1678.5 --> 1684.92
like I've I think physics now is much

1682.73 --> 1687.73
more interesting than I ever thought it

1684.92 --> 1687.73
was at school

1696.6 --> 1703.32
if you continue in globe tourism after

1699.83 --> 1704.58
shown all the FE proofs and they are

1703.32 --> 1709.2
Charles and shields know they're just

1704.58 --> 1711.96
religious fanatics it's like we don't

1709.2 --> 1714.3600000000001
care that we're wrong because we believe

1711.96 --> 1718.6200000000001
and we believe that if we believe that

1714.36 --> 1723.9599999999998
it'll be real it is well in a way

1718.62 --> 1728.9699999999998
fantastical thinking there's a lot of

1723.96 --> 1735.3600000000001
fantastical thinking going on in in the

1728.97 --> 1739.769
globe religion and in fantastical

1735.36 --> 1742.86
thinking usually comes down to broken

1739.769 --> 1746.279
forms of logic it's like you think

1742.86 --> 1748.9799999999998
something and that means you win even

1746.279 --> 1752.1
though when you think about the reason

1748.98 --> 1754.98
for that apparent win doesn't really

1752.1 --> 1757.83
make a lot of sense so it is like a form

1754.98 --> 1760.289
of light psychosis in a way but it can

1757.83 --> 1763.1689999999999
be systematic systemized and in the

1760.289 --> 1766.86
sense that the group all have the same

1763.169 --> 1771.8400000000001
frequency the same position the same

1766.86 --> 1774.539
belief then they may uniformly use a

1771.84 --> 1776.1
singular psychotic mechanism they'll

1774.539 --> 1780.74
just start to copy it because it's like

1776.1 --> 1784.4089999999999
oh yeah write this right like we like

1780.74 --> 1787.169
they equally don't care about it not

1784.409 --> 1789.72
making enough sense to be real because

1787.169 --> 1792.179
it makes sense for their global religion

1789.72 --> 1795.6000000000001
and then it becomes accepted so it

1792.179 --> 1800.75
becomes like an accepted psychotic

1795.6 --> 1804.0
mechanism it's weird how that works and

1800.75 --> 1807.21
that's also how these weird tricks and

1804.0 --> 1808.71
the things that ballers do echo on cuz

1807.21 --> 1811.98
they are like oh wow he found a new

1808.71 --> 1813.45
mechanism okay let's use that so while

1811.98 --> 1815.73
other people are saying a dude that's

1813.45 --> 1817.259
completely insane why are you doing

1815.73 --> 1821.69
that's like no it's not insane you just

1817.259 --> 1821.69
don't understand we have to do this

1823.86 --> 1830.49
that's why they're fun these zealots as

1827.47 --> 1830.49
Nathan Oakley puts it

1844.1 --> 1850.37
well lies exposed it

1853.869 --> 1860.1999999999998
where was that I heard a conversation

1856.809 --> 1865.629
yes yeah it was there over at Karen bees

1860.2 --> 1868.599
with David Weiss I don't know where I

1865.629 --> 1875.32
got this conversation but it is said

1868.599 --> 1882.849
that if you just keep on going and going

1875.32 --> 1886.869
and going it'll become real to you it's

1882.849 --> 1892.029
like even if you start out knowing

1886.869 --> 1894.249
something is a lie and you do it because

1892.029 --> 1896.44
you think you can get money of joy like

1894.249 --> 1898.539
AHA I can control the lie for those

1896.44 --> 1900.729
people and fool them and get money from

1898.539 --> 1907.839
them right well if you do that long

1900.729 --> 1912.309
enough this happens you forget that it

1907.839 --> 1916.029
was a lie by becoming so engrained in

1912.309 --> 1918.609
trying to get to the the belief of your

1916.029 --> 1921.549
target crowd by migrating with your

1918.609 --> 1924.339
conscience to that format to understand

1921.549 --> 1927.489
it and handle it it's very likely that

1924.339 --> 1935.739
suddenly unexpectedly somewhere over the

1927.489 --> 1939.009
time you lit it becomes you so by

1935.739 --> 1945.549
accident you switch into actually

1939.009 --> 1950.159
believing what you knew to be a lie so

1945.549 --> 1953.4089999999999
pay chills are they what does that mean

1950.159 --> 1955.749
you know they they could be like ha ha

1953.409 --> 1958.749
ha you got to do this it's making money

1955.749 --> 1961.21
but just by doing it for such a long

1958.749 --> 1963.82
time getting so invested in it becomes

1961.21 --> 1968.469
real to them even though they started

1963.82 --> 1973.119
out being informed that it was fake they

1968.469 --> 1975.1290000000001
may even have for originally designed

1973.119 --> 1978.119
some things that they knew like haha

1975.129 --> 1982.509
technically this works but it's not real

1978.119 --> 1985.85
but then by eventually using it so many

1982.509 --> 1989.09
times they may forget about

1985.85 --> 1993.4599999999998
how it was originally made and then

1989.09 --> 1993.4599999999998
start to believe believe it is literal

1998.35 --> 2006.019
right because if you get paid to forward

2002.309 --> 2009.6
lies or nonsense there's a great risk

2006.019 --> 2012.269
because it is so tough to hold up hold

2009.6 --> 2015.4189999999999
known lies for such a long time that the

2012.269 --> 2019.139
psyche simply will curse you and make it

2015.419 --> 2020.909
real in order to get by but then it's

2019.139 --> 2022.7099999999998
going to be very tough to escape from

2020.909 --> 2027.5390000000002
that because then you get into the same

2022.71 --> 2029.309
position as your target group ah we're

2027.539 --> 2031.259
in the formed about that were you shells

2029.309 --> 2035.039
you didn't know what that when you

2031.259 --> 2039.629
started there did you yeah there's

2035.039 --> 2043.07
always a price the price is just not

2039.629 --> 2043.07
always what you expect it to be

2051.34 --> 2055.46
[Music]

2052.93 --> 2058.37
yeah if you use lights to control

2055.46 --> 2063.35
victims then eventually you will become

2058.37 --> 2065.06
the victims of those lies and not even

2063.35 --> 2069.52
in a metaphorical sense or in a

2065.06 --> 2073.31
consequential sense but literally you

2069.52 --> 2080.08
may become the very subject of the lies

2073.31 --> 2080.08
you thought you were willing mentally

2086.899 --> 2097.6189999999997
so yeah I think that concerning that

2090.389 --> 2103.789
Randy has quite a lot of annoying or a

2097.619 --> 2103.789
yeah hard to swallow pills ahead of him

2108.2 --> 2113.1899999999996
and that that's just him you know she

2111.029 --> 2116.099
can you imagine the type of pills that

2113.19 --> 2119.4
Alex Jones is going through that that's

2116.099 --> 2123.92
why he is sometimes just almost

2119.4 --> 2128.63
effectively psychotic he isn't really

2123.92 --> 2131.46
sometimes because of just the amount of

2128.63 --> 2134.809
placement stuff that he's taken on and

2131.46 --> 2134.809
it's just it's become him

2139.48 --> 2145.21
if you go with information placement

2142.3 --> 2152.07
then eventually the information you

2145.21 --> 2152.07
place will become the truth for you

2157.82 --> 2161.159

2164.32 --> 2170.8900000000003
what Guns of Navarone stop poke you come

2168.73 --> 2176.28
on you two stop poking at one another

2170.89 --> 2176.2799999999997
every time what's your problem

2193.92 --> 2196.94
all right

2212.82 --> 2216.0190000000002
[Music]

2228.23 --> 2233.65
summer is here tidies look just check it

2233.03 --> 2236.63
out

2233.65 --> 2239.719
such amazing winner

2236.63 --> 2239.719
[Music]

2255.38 --> 2260.32
yeah it's not entirely chemtrail frito

2257.84 --> 2260.32
but

2262.87 --> 2269.98
see like that is definitely not a normal

2266.89 --> 2276.87
cloud you gotta realize that there is

2269.98 --> 2276.87
that but yeah it's still beautiful

2285.3 --> 2288.369
[Music]

2306.42 --> 2314.039
ah okay Guns of Navarone yeah

2309.99 --> 2316.859
is that a sixth sense or is it this is

2314.039 --> 2317.6090000000004
the frequency sense I have that very

2316.859 --> 2320.5789999999997
strongly

2317.609 --> 2329.7599999999998
but I've trained on that for like half

2320.579 --> 2335.4500000000003
my life it's it's it to truly understand

2329.76 --> 2339.9300000000003
evil is very difficult because things

2335.45 --> 2343.339
that seem evil to a good person it's

2339.93 --> 2347.8489999999997
it's often different it's a very it

2343.339 --> 2352.71
things work differently and affect a

2347.849 --> 2355.38
person in another way as it does when

2352.71 --> 2357.48
they are effectively engaging in evil

2355.38 --> 2359.88
and evil machinations and mechanisms for

2357.48 --> 2366.17
themselves it's a whole different game

2359.88 --> 2370.13
in that position and yeah it's like a

2366.17 --> 2370.13
it's difficult to describe

2379.77 --> 2383.39
but yeah it's

2385.79 --> 2393.2
if people have engaged in very evil

2389.0 --> 2397.07
things that like set the tone you know

2393.2 --> 2400.1299999999997
then they may still have natural will or

2397.07 --> 2404.63
need to have normal human behavior and

2400.13 --> 2408.7400000000002
all that and to socially especially but

2404.63 --> 2411.9500000000003
they will carry that nagging frequency

2408.74 --> 2412.6699999999996
in the back in the back of their mind of

2411.95 --> 2416.47
their heart

2412.67 --> 2421.609
of what they deal with and that they

2416.47 --> 2423.35
have done that it does change yeah your

2421.609 --> 2425.45
maneuverability it's almost like a chain

2423.35 --> 2430.3689999999997
all of those types of things are like

2425.45 --> 2433.609
chains on the spirit and that is

2430.369 --> 2437.75
sensible when people have a lot of

2433.609 --> 2441.65
problem to naturally let their spirit

2437.75 --> 2443.3
maneuver socially they become often a

2441.65 --> 2445.76
lot of these people become extremely

2443.3 --> 2449.5
socially awkward it's like the extreme

2445.76 --> 2451.869
liberals right they become extremely

2449.5 --> 2457.43
socially awkward and out of place

2451.869 --> 2460.07
extremely why is that it is because

2457.43 --> 2464.93
their entire spirit is just so chained

2460.07 --> 2470.69
down they don't have any natural being

2464.93 --> 2474.3199999999997
left to do socializing with so it

2470.69 --> 2477.17
becomes like a constructed act almost

2474.32 --> 2480.53
and it usually gets very clumsy because

2477.17 --> 2482.66
they lose track they lose when you lose

2480.53 --> 2485.21
the natural ability to express yourself

2482.66 --> 2486.7999999999997
and to be a human being outside of

2485.21 --> 2490.34
whatever you do because your spirits are

2486.8 --> 2492.6800000000003
chained down do you also lose the

2490.34 --> 2494.51
understanding and insight of what it

2492.68 --> 2497.5699999999997
really is and how it really functions

2494.51 --> 2500.5400000000004
and you lose even track of how to

2497.57 --> 2506.7200000000003
recognize it so you effectively become

2500.54 --> 2509.96
like a psychopath really you lose your

2506.72 --> 2513.95
senses in that if you get too chained

2509.96 --> 2517.42
down that's why some lot of these

2513.95 --> 2519.2
extreme liberals and politicians are so

2517.42 --> 2524.89
socially awkward

2519.2 --> 2528.29
and just nuts that's exactly why that is

2524.89 --> 2529.089
that is the reason why they are like

2528.29 --> 2531.56
that

2529.089 --> 2533.859
because they are so chained down in

2531.56 --> 2537.77
their spirit and what they have to do in

2533.859 --> 2540.0789999999997
things they basically let them let

2537.77 --> 2542.119
themselves be forced to do even though

2540.079 --> 2544.4900000000002
they don't naturally like it they're so

2542.119 --> 2547.369
against their own inner nature's really

2544.49 --> 2550.8799999999997
their own original inner nature that

2547.369 --> 2553.88
they lose all track of what it is to be

2550.88 --> 2557.21
natural they're just chained up in their

2553.88 --> 2559.7200000000003
in their program and they're kind of

2557.21 --> 2562.91
desperately trying to improvise to

2559.72 --> 2564.859
socially get around and still find some

2562.91 --> 2567.2
kind of respect or momentum even though

2564.859 --> 2572.69
they're basically like broken social

2567.2 --> 2578.75
robots that's how you recognize an

2572.69 --> 2581.0
extreme liberal those normal people when

2578.75 --> 2584.15
they're broken down when they're like

2581.0 --> 2586.64
burdened by [ __ ] you know they don't go

2584.15 --> 2589.64
out and socialize because it makes you

2586.64 --> 2592.5499999999997
socially awkward right it's like no you

2589.64 --> 2594.8289999999997
need some time to restore so you can let

2592.55 --> 2596.8100000000004
the natural spring forth from you again

2594.829 --> 2598.73
and use it again to connect and

2596.81 --> 2601.369
socialize it in a sensible way in a

2598.73 --> 2603.7400000000002
durable way right but if you are like a

2601.369 --> 2606.349
politician or an industrialist and

2603.74 --> 2608.839
you're so tied up in all of that in the

2606.349 --> 2612.589
business in just the Atlantan the

2608.839 --> 2616.19
advantage so much then you don't have

2612.589 --> 2618.2599999999998
the maneuvering room to allow yourself

2616.19 --> 2621.29
to retract like that no you're going to

2618.26 --> 2624.05
be constantly forced to abuse whatever

2621.29 --> 2627.52
social time you have left in order to

2624.05 --> 2630.8
progress your freaking industrial or

2627.52 --> 2632.93
financial political agenda so that

2630.8 --> 2635.119
they're they're forced to do it even

2632.93 --> 2639.77
though they're broken down in their own

2635.119 --> 2644.089
mechanisms that's how crazy it gets

2639.77 --> 2647.2599999999998
that's how grab Walt they get Grabill

2644.089 --> 2650.96
tied in tied into earthly priorities

2647.26 --> 2652.9300000000003
putting aside or sacrificing natural

2650.96 --> 2656.45
parts of yourself for

2652.93 --> 2659.27
for the dirt of the earth for earthly

2656.45 --> 2661.4199999999996
possessions or power that's what that

2659.27 --> 2661.42
does

2672.12 --> 2674.93
right

2676.65 --> 2684.42
yeah today's liberal is not a real

2678.99 --> 2689.9599999999996
liberal it's like a liberal with two or

2684.42 --> 2689.96
three L's that's that's what it's become

2695.69 --> 2706.73
I think that what liberal was is what

2702.5 --> 2708.53
people now call a libertarian sort of it

2706.73 --> 2712.849
kind of it's that's what it's that's

2708.53 --> 2715.76
what it that original spirit and mindset

2712.849 --> 2717.4700000000003
in response to how the world is what

2715.76 --> 2721.76
that kind of turn into it turn into a

2717.47 --> 2724.49
libertarian because a liberal that's no

2721.76 --> 2729.9100000000003
longer liberal it's more like liberals

2724.49 --> 2746.72
are liberated from God right right

2729.91 --> 2750.109
that's really what that is your father's

2746.72 --> 2755.41
liberal fell asleep and let the wolf in

2750.109 --> 2755.41
the door what okay

2769.13 --> 2777.4500000000003
yeah yeah yeah no look six-six it's just

2773.279 --> 2782.789
freaking numbers it it's not about

2777.45 --> 2785.8799999999997
numbers it's about unspoken known things

2782.789 --> 2787.8900000000003
what you know what resonates what

2785.88 --> 2790.71
resonates with the spirit what resonates

2787.89 --> 2794.029
with original born spirit because that

2790.71 --> 2797.46
arrives in animals in humans children

2794.029 --> 2800.19
natural arrived spirit and that stays

2797.46 --> 2802.7690000000002
unless it is aggressively destroyed or

2800.19 --> 2806.369
taken away or mind controlled out of

2802.769 --> 2809.279
there right it's not about numbers

2806.369 --> 2813.2690000000002
numbers are just numbers their concept a

2809.279 --> 2817.259
number is a concept okay it is a mind

2813.269 --> 2821.5389999999998
frame reference it's just a number no

2817.259 --> 2824.46
it's the spirit the mechanisms the

2821.539 --> 2827.6090000000004
things you can only describe because

2824.46 --> 2829.559
it's not just a word that is really what

2827.609 --> 2832.739
makes it what it is and that is what we

2829.559 --> 2837.7490000000003
were effectively recognized numbers are

2832.739 --> 2839.67
just numbers it's like every time

2837.749 --> 2846.9199999999996
something somebody brings that up I'm

2839.67 --> 2850.2000000000003
like you're letting a concept basically

2846.92 --> 2853.559
distract you from the much more complex

2850.2 --> 2859.0789999999997
and integrated problems that are really

2853.559 --> 2862.1090000000004
there you let you use the numbers to

2859.079 --> 2864.1800000000003
allow your mind to be oversimplified in

2862.109 --> 2869.0989999999997
the approach of this vast complex

2864.18 --> 2872.569
problem you know that's kind of my

2869.099 --> 2872.569
problem with that and with gematria

2898.27 --> 2909.52
huh yeah Guns of Navarone maybe look I

2906.13 --> 2911.9500000000003
don't know about these crazy crazy-ass

2909.52 --> 2915.73
people what they do you know the thing

2911.95 --> 2920.29
is that if it would discontinue for some

2915.73 --> 2923.83
reason this yeah the the possibility for

2920.29 --> 2927.07
them to do as they do then they still

2923.83 --> 2931.12
have done that you know that's the

2927.07 --> 2934.42
biggest problem is when you let yourself

2931.12 --> 2937.41
go in certain ways when you let certain

2934.42 --> 2940.57
forms of dignity or responsibilities go

2937.41 --> 2947.14
then no matter what happens afterward

2940.57 --> 2950.38
you did that you did that and that

2947.14 --> 2954.25
cannot be undone you did that and you

2950.38 --> 2956.85
will always have done that and by doing

2954.25 --> 2961.65
things especially letting dignity go

2956.85 --> 2965.17
right all that it it takes away it

2961.65 --> 2970.33
scrapes away a level of energy from your

2965.17 --> 2972.91
soul it D condenses your spirit weakens

2970.33 --> 2978.13
you effectively you become less cohesive

2972.91 --> 2980.8599999999997
it spreads out and you become more with

2978.13 --> 2986.02
all kinds of symptoms from slight

2980.86 --> 2989.53
depression or more less enthusiastic to

2986.02 --> 2993.28
less cohesive less needs for cohesion

2989.53 --> 2996.25
your people that do that I will be more

2993.28 --> 3000.75
fine with just having nonsense being

2996.25 --> 3004.44
talked about they won't care right so

3000.75 --> 3006.99
even even if they stop trolling us then

3004.44 --> 3008.33
they still have done all this what are

3006.99 --> 3011.49
they going to do next

3008.33 --> 3014.87
they've effectively made themselves into

3011.49 --> 3017.97
these crazy cultists self driven

3014.87 --> 3020.19
delusional cultists that have this

3017.97 --> 3023.3599999999997
impulse to constantly harass other

3020.19 --> 3026.73
people that don't agree with them and

3023.36 --> 3029.15
what are they going to do you know like

3026.73 --> 3031.369
can you get over that

3029.15 --> 3036.079
after you've went that far

3031.369 --> 3039.4300000000003
can you is that a pasta I don't know it

3036.079 --> 3044.8390000000004
will take some some real tough

3039.43 --> 3049.249
self-reflection to get to climb out of

3044.839 --> 3052.48
that hole again guys I wonder if people

3049.249 --> 3056.66
even understand just the implication of

3052.48 --> 3059.119
people going that far in chats and not

3056.66 --> 3061.779
just in chats because it's just a chance

3059.119 --> 3065.96
I'm just anonymous but guess what

3061.779 --> 3068.45
everything you do you have done whether

3065.96 --> 3070.309
you allowed yourself to be conscious of

3068.45 --> 3074.48
actually doing that and the implications

3070.309 --> 3079.099
or not you did that that part is now

3074.48 --> 3082.64
part of you and it will reflect on you

3079.099 --> 3086.4500000000003
even if the situation stops even if

3082.64 --> 3090.1299999999997
things change around you did that and it

3086.45 --> 3090.1299999999997
will reflect on your soul

3096.15 --> 3102.6600000000003
and yeah then your soul is your mirror

3100.17 --> 3105.48
that's what people get to see of you now

3102.66 --> 3109.6499999999996
you will see less but other people will

3105.48 --> 3113.579
not they will just start to see that you

3109.65 --> 3115.829
see less that you've become blinded and

3113.579 --> 3119.099
you won't see it or you wouldn't want to

3115.829 --> 3121.3390000000004
see it because it is like a scar in the

3119.099 --> 3121.339
mind

3146.58 --> 3151.85
thank you good serving I appreciate that

3148.47 --> 3151.85
I do my best

3165.11 --> 3171.6200000000003
all right well yeah it would be pretty

3168.89 --> 3173.72
nasty situation if these trolls are

3171.62 --> 3177.5299999999997
getting this psychologically offensive

3173.72 --> 3180.6099999999997
and delusion or delusional if they'd get

3177.53 --> 3183.34
into government positions and would have

3180.61 --> 3187.73
bureaucracy powers over other people

3183.34 --> 3192.6800000000003
that would be potentially a horror

3187.73 --> 3197.84
scenario that would drive any person

3192.68 --> 3201.71
insane like that's like a satanic

3197.84 --> 3204.77
systems situation idea like total power

3201.71 --> 3208.1
controls like total spiritual kill on

3204.77 --> 3210.86
everything that's gonna happen like if

3208.1 --> 3214.4
these if that was is that where to

3210.86 --> 3216.23
happen it'll be over so quick over so

3214.4 --> 3219.32
quick it's not gonna take long before

3216.23 --> 3221.81
somebody's just gonna strangle them if

3219.32 --> 3225.4700000000003
they'd actually have this freaking power

3221.81 --> 3229.07
and be dead delusional and sick they

3225.47 --> 3230.93
people snap just regular people would

3229.07 --> 3234.77
snap and just strangle them

3230.93 --> 3237.6499999999996
you know if face-to-face situations the

3234.77 --> 3244.37
DMV or whatever can you imagine like

3237.65 --> 3246.4
zanuck working at the DMV being who he

3244.37 --> 3246.4
is

3248.77 --> 3255.44
right but I don't know where it where

3252.53 --> 3259.7000000000003
it's gonna go for all of them you know

3255.44 --> 3263.0
maybe maybe they will have another

3259.7 --> 3266.5099999999998
chance to climb out of that that's super

3263.0 --> 3269.21
deep [ __ ] maybe I will get it a

3266.51 --> 3273.71
final and almost impossible seeming

3269.21 --> 3276.38
chance eventually if if things just

3273.71 --> 3279.23
don't suddenly switch around and starts

3276.38 --> 3284.56
crushing the fools because that is what

3279.23 --> 3288.59
can happen like the Beast and his games

3284.56 --> 3292.09
what he does the Beast the the the

3288.59 --> 3295.25
craziness the allowance of people's

3292.09 --> 3296.9
terrible behavior that that the

3295.25 --> 3301.7
normalization of that

3296.9 --> 3305.39
this happens but in extreme switches you

3301.7 --> 3306.799
know when yeah when a lot of action

3305.39 --> 3309.319
happens or where subtle ease things

3306.799 --> 3313.4
switch around those people are the ones

3309.319 --> 3320.48
that typically get completely crushed in

3313.4 --> 3324.799
the change it's like the more you cooked

3320.48 --> 3328.339
to the devil on the spot the more you

3324.799 --> 3331.369
will be crushed when things suddenly

3328.339 --> 3334.94
change around you are the ones that are

3331.369 --> 3339.17
putting yourselves in between the wheels

3334.94 --> 3341.029
of the carriage right you're you that's

3339.17 --> 3343.039
where you're being placed and then

3341.029 --> 3345.23
suddenly if action happens and the

3343.039 --> 3348.0190000000002
carrot starts sprinting yeah you get

3345.23 --> 3350.21
yeah you risk literally getting crushed

3348.019 --> 3354.319
under the wheels that that I think

3350.21 --> 3356.71
that's a good metaphor that's just what

3354.319 --> 3356.71
happens

3385.24 --> 3398.7999999999997
hmm yeah better fennel I totally believe

3388.84 --> 3401.92
that yep Maria Magdalena I I can

3398.8 --> 3405.25
absolutely go with that I I've never

3401.92 --> 3406.69
read the book of her before though I'd

3405.25 --> 3409.29
be interested to learn a little bit more

3406.69 --> 3409.29
about it

3424.74 --> 3429.47
huh

3426.599 --> 3429.4700000000003
interesting

3438.31 --> 3450.16
right well george sanford like what is a

3442.63 --> 3453.6400000000003
religion you know in a way religions are

3450.16 --> 3455.89
all control mechanisms that's what they

3453.64 --> 3458.14
effectively are and if there's not

3455.89 --> 3462.91
enough truth in the control mechanism

3458.14 --> 3465.8199999999997
then yeah there will be no hope for the

3462.91 --> 3468.64
people that are part of it so the more

3465.82 --> 3471.31
truth that is in between the control

3468.64 --> 3475.5699999999997
mechanism attempts and lies the more

3471.31 --> 3480.1
appealing it becomes so religion is

3475.57 --> 3484.1200000000003
really the art of taking fundamental

3480.1 --> 3489.7
truths and then encapsulating them with

3484.12 --> 3492.52
exoteric busying therapy and diversions

3489.7 --> 3495.58
from priests that take her over that

3492.52 --> 3497.65
take over the authority of God in that

3495.58 --> 3500.56
case you know that that is what

3497.65 --> 3503.44
religions really do but that doesn't

3500.56 --> 3507.16
mean that at the core the material the

3503.44 --> 3510.04
message is that that's not true see it's

3507.16 --> 3513.19
always the exoteric explanations and the

3510.04 --> 3516.7799999999997
distractions by absolutes material

3513.19 --> 3519.52
factual details or something instead of

3516.78 --> 3523.09
what is the real context what's the

3519.52 --> 3526.12
energy what's the multi-layered system

3523.09 --> 3529.26
of what is actually happening what is

3526.12 --> 3529.2599999999998
the overarching meaning

3538.42 --> 3544.92
if I seen the series true legends no

3541.45 --> 3544.9199999999996
sorry Hanako Ellen never heard of that

3556.6 --> 3562.46
take a break lies you lost that but

3559.49 --> 3563.4799999999996
that's not how we work there's always

3562.46 --> 3569.51
more lies

3563.48 --> 3575.87
you know there's infinite lies just it's

3569.51 --> 3580.4
just that no lie can last forever but

3575.87 --> 3585.0099999999998
there's infinite of it if there is a

3580.4 --> 3585.01
need by a spirit for it

3600.839 --> 3606.8089999999997
hmm right bit of fennel I totally agree

3604.229 --> 3608.989
with that I was just describing the

3606.809 --> 3613.289
mechanisms of the religions out there

3608.989 --> 3616.079
what it really is because yeah if you

3613.289 --> 3618.6600000000003
paid attention to Christ's teachings

3616.079 --> 3622.529
then you know that you are your own

3618.66 --> 3626.64
temple your body is the temple for your

3622.529 --> 3629.069
spirit and your soul and you should take

3626.64 --> 3632.489
care of your body as if it were your

3629.069 --> 3635.43
church and you should be careful as to

3632.489 --> 3640.259
who you invite into your church which is

3635.43 --> 3644.1499999999996
your spirit this is so see that I think

3640.259 --> 3646.739
that is the real way to do it and this

3644.15 --> 3650.4790000000003
externalization of having a literal

3646.739 --> 3655.0190000000002
building with an authority figure in it

3650.479 --> 3659.43
that's already wrong by Christ's own

3655.019 --> 3663.3289999999997
declaration that's taking away the

3659.43 --> 3665.3999999999996
authority of God for yourself and then

3663.329 --> 3668.8390000000004
get handing it to another person to take

3665.4 --> 3668.839
that responsibility for you

3671.6 --> 3676.5299999999997
but yeah it doesn't seem to matter a lot

3674.31 --> 3680.16
that he did say that and that it's in

3676.53 --> 3682.9500000000003
the book the book that is used as the

3680.16 --> 3685.02
foundation or the set to be the

3682.95 --> 3688.29
foundation of a religion that's gone on

3685.02 --> 3691.56
for hundreds of years it's so ironic

3688.29 --> 3693.84
isn't it it's like their own book tells

3691.56 --> 3694.7
them that everything they are doing is

3693.84 --> 3699.09
wrong

3694.7 --> 3703.35
yet nobody realizes that really you know

3699.09 --> 3706.44
how bizarre is that there's a religion

3703.35 --> 3710.19
out there it's very popular widespread a

3706.44 --> 3712.41
lot of money and in that religion the

3710.19 --> 3716.58
core figure what it's all supposed to be

3712.41 --> 3719.94
about tells people doing all these

3716.58 --> 3722.1
things that the people that are in that

3719.94 --> 3724.7400000000002
religion know they are effectively doing

3722.1 --> 3734.16
these in crisis doing all these things

3724.74 --> 3735.87
is wrong it's just to a certain degree

3734.16 --> 3742.23
you got laugh about it

3735.87 --> 3744.87
the irony of it anyway I'm gonna round

3742.23 --> 3747.2400000000002
