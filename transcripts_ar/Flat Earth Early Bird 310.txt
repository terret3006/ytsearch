[Music]

36.32 --> 43.14
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.11 --> 44.76
early-bird number 310 I'm your host

43.14 --> 46.410000000000004
Arwen and before we start the show

44.76 --> 48.93
please don't forget to share it on any

46.41 --> 50.25
platform you deem fit and also if you

48.93 --> 51.989
haven't already subscribed to my channel

50.25 --> 53.37
and hit the bell notification so you

51.989 --> 55.68
know when I'm going live which is

53.37 --> 58.8
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

55.68 --> 61.26
day please do support my channel through

58.8 --> 62.91
the Pay Pal patreon my GoFundMe and the

61.26 --> 67.94
super Jets that would be much

62.91 --> 75.78
appreciated so today is a lovely day

67.94 --> 80.42999999999999
well except for the numerous amounts of

75.78 --> 83.67
chemtrails but if you just don't look at

80.43 --> 87.78
the sky too much it's really a beautiful

83.67 --> 90.899
day and nice and warm and not windy but

87.78 --> 102.77
my god they've really been ramping up

90.899 --> 108.81
the chemtrails alright so today I got

102.77 --> 113.19
Tamera coffee with me tea and the

108.81 --> 117.84
tangerine yeah looking forward to that

113.19 --> 119.729
and I also by the way restocked up on my

117.84 --> 124.83
critical supplements that I have been

119.729 --> 129.959
without now for two weeks and that have

124.83 --> 131.60999999999999
been quite a drain on my I say on my

129.959 --> 133.41
critical focus I don't know if you

131.61 --> 136.38000000000002
noticed that I definitely did notice

133.41 --> 138.959
that I had like lost track pretty badly

136.38 --> 144.41
at times I normally don't really do that

138.959 --> 147.02
a lot so yeah I got fish oil back and

144.41 --> 153.209
also yeah what is it

147.02 --> 155.77
as stuck Centene it's like an LG extract

153.209 --> 158.65
it's very dynamic

155.77 --> 162.70000000000002
so I'd like to combine it and then put

158.65 --> 169.75
chlorella on top of that it's like it's

162.7 --> 177.01
an all ocean package fantastic LG fish

169.75 --> 181.78
and what is it what is chlorella is that

177.01 --> 185.38
also else your oh yeah it's more algae

181.78 --> 190.18
okay anyway that's about yeah yeah algae

185.38 --> 193.03
are great I like them and that's why I

190.18 --> 199.96
think that big LGF plants are a great

193.03 --> 203.89
idea so yeah I took like four fish oils

199.96 --> 205.87
and weirdly enough well I'm taking the

203.89 --> 208.26999999999998
tumeric off you know but weirdly enough

205.87 --> 211.42000000000002
I'm actually as soon as I really started

208.27 --> 213.52
taking it I started to get sleepy now

211.42 --> 215.73999999999998
funnily enough somebody would think okay

213.52 --> 219.48000000000002
why would you get sleepy well that's

215.74 --> 222.67000000000002
probably because my body is like okay

219.48 --> 223.66
yeah we want that but there's just this

222.67 --> 227.47
thing about it

223.66 --> 230.57999999999998
we can only just store it and it's only

227.47 --> 233.29
when you take a nap could be a power nap

230.58 --> 236.86
that you're probably really gonna get

233.29 --> 240.76
the effect and it's gonna get to the

236.86 --> 242.95000000000002
place it needs to be and so therefore

240.76 --> 244.69
I'm actually getting sleepy because my

242.95 --> 248.38
body is probably looking very much

244.69 --> 254.32
forward to getting the right things on

248.38 --> 261.51
the right spot but I'm already noticing

254.32 --> 261.51
that yeah I feel bit restored

261.59 --> 266.78
now of course the good weather also

264.06 --> 266.78000000000003
helps a lot

267.9 --> 271.44
[Music]

274.75 --> 277.38
yeah

278.21 --> 284.34999999999997
now of course the placebo also has a lot

280.729 --> 284.34999999999997
to do with it by the way with me always

284.77 --> 300.979
but technically I've was it I've I know

295.09 --> 303.40999999999997
hypothesized it by also taking fish oils

300.979 --> 306.86
when I was really seriously depressed

303.41 --> 309.05
and like you know that was much when I

306.86 --> 310.82
was younger like in my teens it's like

309.05 --> 312.86
the first time I really tried I never

310.82 --> 315.59
liked fish I always avoided that and

312.86 --> 318.86
that my parents figured out like maybe

315.59 --> 323.479
just needs fish oil some kind that and

318.86 --> 325.82
that did help so when I would be

323.479 --> 328.31
apathetic and didn't really care whether

325.82 --> 330.94
it works or not it would still work so

328.31 --> 334.78000000000003
it's not just the placebo effect

330.94 --> 334.78
notice from experience

340.9 --> 348.36899999999997
[Music]

342.789 --> 348.36899999999997
okay anyway let's see who isn't jet

[Music]

420.59 --> 426.86999999999995
yeah I was kind of enjoying Owen

423.33 --> 428.64
Benjamin right before this almost got to

426.87 --> 435.48
the our mark but yeah I was just

428.64 --> 438.9
hilarious just just these fantastic

435.48 --> 441.39000000000004
little things and clips that he

438.9 --> 441.9
highlights and it's just amazing can't

441.39 --> 447.27
wait

441.9 --> 452.21999999999997
looking forward to continuing that let's

447.27 --> 457.919
see all right I was visiting ayran raw

452.22 --> 460.47
media was life this morning I was in the

457.919 --> 467.49
chat I was kind of interesting I had a

460.47 --> 474.47
good energy oh yeah so was red pill

467.49 --> 477.69
philosophy and yeah yesterday evening or

474.47 --> 479.49
night Brandi went live with this all

477.69 --> 485.85
ladies night night that turned out to be

479.49 --> 488.18
a sausage fest but it was still yeah was

485.85 --> 488.18
the end

494.599 --> 499.099
Gary right no Jason it was Jason history

498.169 --> 505.099
yeah

499.099 --> 510.08
Jason disagree we're talking about again

505.099 --> 512.18
somebody had reported him like sent some

510.08 --> 516.919
some kind of weird complaint file about

512.18 --> 518.87
concerning gravity to his boss it's just

516.919 --> 522.68
ridiculous anyway that that was pretty

518.87 --> 530.5600000000001
much what the entire or auntie evening

522.68 --> 535.79
was about yeah he had this very bad day

530.56 --> 541.2399999999999
so I hope yeah yeah the obstacles can

535.79 --> 541.24
all be overcome without too much damage

541.899 --> 546.35
and I'm kind of curious to find out who

544.339 --> 548.3000000000001
it was everybody in chat was pretty much

546.35 --> 552.2900000000001
trolling that it was George Annette and

548.3 --> 557.0889999999999
you of course because it's funny and

552.29 --> 559.699
because he did that with Ryan Mullen but

557.089 --> 563.089
yeah George and he was very triggered

559.699 --> 573.1099999999999
about it even why are you falsely

563.089 --> 578.99
accusing me the policies are so silly so

573.11 --> 581.48
just out of their minds did you also see

578.99 --> 583.97
the after show yet or it does that still

581.48 --> 588.79
have to show I think was the last

583.97 --> 595.63
aftershow after the second show man

588.79 --> 601.639
Nathan when to add it again was annek

595.63 --> 605.81
like sanic went into total psychotic

601.639 --> 610.22
confusion like beyond Brenda levels that

605.81 --> 612.949
was just like at one point I interrupted

610.22 --> 615.25
Nathan got really pissed like how dare

612.949 --> 615.25
you

617.16 --> 626.68
but yeah

622.77 --> 631.39
Nathan was really spellbound to do his

626.68 --> 634.9599999999999
thing there pretty much it just stayed

631.39 --> 643.18
on the sidelines after that took at

634.96 --> 646.32
least an hour and was crazy sanic is

643.18 --> 646.3199999999999
just totally out of his mind

647.85 --> 656.38
it's like desperate cultist level it's

653.71 --> 658.8100000000001
like okay it is so blatantly obvious

656.38 --> 663.55
that it is a cult but you just can't let

658.81 --> 666.4599999999999
it go type situation that's what it kind

663.55 --> 669.1899999999999
of almost starts to feel like like they

666.46 --> 672.07
don't want it to end but they kind of

669.19 --> 674.1400000000001
already know that it's that it is kind

672.07 --> 676.12
that they're keeping themselves they

674.14 --> 678.31
forever probably already know now that

676.12 --> 682.69
they are indeed keeping themselves in

678.31 --> 685.26
this weird spell and in keeping

682.69 --> 687.6400000000001
themselves aligned to the to a system

685.26 --> 692.08
because we're pointing it at it with

687.64 --> 694.18
such detail so the only route left is to

692.08 --> 696.58
literally just confuse the [ __ ] out of

694.18 --> 700.0
yourself and try to drag everyone with

696.58 --> 704.64
it that seems to be their primary tactic

700.0 --> 704.64
now when you really push the shove

714.48 --> 721.95
well Nicholas Roberts yeah Nathan did

719.43 --> 724.5899999999999
what Nathan does when he gets the chance

721.95 --> 726.75
when he can when his kid is not like in

724.59 --> 728.5500000000001
a wave or his wife could be angry after

726.75 --> 735.42
that kind of thing so they were probably

728.55 --> 738.14
uh and I don't know it all really

735.42 --> 742.41
depends on how you're gonna look at it

738.14 --> 747.36
because Nathan is being seemingly very

742.41 --> 750.3299999999999
sadistic but what he's really trying to

747.36 --> 752.34
do and that's what's just bypassing

750.33 --> 754.9100000000001
everyone that is being subjected to it

752.34 --> 758.3100000000001
is that he's just trying to get through

754.91 --> 762.15
he just wants the answers and he will

758.31 --> 766.8599999999999
push it - maniacal levels in order to

762.15 --> 769.62
achieve this and if you're gonna decline

766.86 --> 772.5600000000001
and just red herring the [ __ ] out of

769.62 --> 776.97
everything or Gaslight him or worse then

772.56 --> 780.18
yeah you're gonna be pushed so hard so

776.97 --> 783.78
much in the core of this obvious spell

780.18 --> 786.6899999999999
you're keeping yourself into that yeah

783.78 --> 789.75
that you are either gonna break feel

786.69 --> 791.25
very shitty and run away and then some

789.75 --> 793.64
moments of reflections and who knows

791.25 --> 797.7
will happen maybe you'll snap back in or

793.64 --> 803.09
you will literally just go nuts under

797.7 --> 806.6700000000001
the pressure like acute stress overload

803.09 --> 810.9300000000001
symptoms and that can cause severe

806.67 --> 813.9599999999999
amnesia or make you shoot into an

810.93 --> 815.2199999999999
emotional state very severe and not be

813.96 --> 817.83
able to get out of it where you're just

815.22 --> 819.75
going to be yelling that there are the

817.83 --> 822.21
types of responses to severe pressure

819.75 --> 825.5
and that's what we've been seeing but it

822.21 --> 829.74
is really just to try to get through and

825.5 --> 832.47
besides what is keeping these people

829.74 --> 834.21
there you know that is that is what

832.47 --> 837.03
everybody's wondering like these people

834.21 --> 840.87
are literally voluntarily being there

837.03 --> 842.97
there's what is it the hundreds of

840.87 --> 845.44
channels out there and including a lot

842.97 --> 848.03
of globe or hangouts and

845.44 --> 851.6800000000001
discussion groups so many but yet they

848.03 --> 855.38
do keep coming to the Flat Earth debates

851.68 --> 858.65
letting themselves be subjected to that

855.38 --> 860.06
and they know that's gonna happen and

858.65 --> 862.1899999999999
they know when it's gonna happen and

860.06 --> 867.26
they don't walk away they either go in

862.19 --> 871.87
Stephanie mode or they just try to keep

867.26 --> 874.97
up the act and try to Gaslight it and

871.87 --> 875.87
doesn't work becomes completely

874.97 --> 878.9
doublespeak

875.87 --> 882.41
and confusing and totally messed up

878.9 --> 886.28
psychotic so yeah that's what's gonna

882.41 --> 889.01
happen and I don't see like oh it's

886.28 --> 892.22
wrong no you know certain levels of

889.01 --> 897.29
energy are warranted depending on the

892.22 --> 899.6600000000001
purpose of it and it's very clear that

897.29 --> 902.6899999999999
they can walk away and yes they will be

899.66 --> 909.49
humiliated when that Nathan does that

902.69 --> 909.49
he's very open about it you know so

909.76 --> 915.65
nobody's forcing these people to come

912.14 --> 917.3
there that we know of you know we don't

915.65 --> 922.36
know if they're like contractually

917.3 --> 924.92
obligated somehow to do that of no idea

922.36 --> 930.71
it's probably not the case they're

924.92 --> 935.0899999999999
probably just religiously inclined to do

930.71 --> 943.09
this they have to they have to stop us

935.09 --> 943.09
in their minds so yeah

943.54 --> 949.5799999999999
yeah Nathan was getting off and it was a

947.0 --> 957.22
little disturbing but he was also kind

949.58 --> 957.22
of like going with the act remember of

957.79 --> 964.4
of the globe earth dictate so it was

962.72 --> 967.1600000000001
blatantly obvious that he was doing that

964.4 --> 969.5889999999999
but he kind of stuck to it a little bit

967.16 --> 972.98
long and there was its Nathan Nathan

969.589 --> 980.8000000000001
does it the way he does and can't handle

972.98 --> 983.99
it I step away I do when I don't like

980.8 --> 986.8
listening to that stuff I just walk away

983.99 --> 993.05
I go make lunch or something I did

986.8 --> 997.5799999999999
certain point or I just start laughing

993.05 --> 1001.5699999999999
I just cuz Edie is also freaking funny

997.58 --> 1004.33
in a way I just can't help it but that's

1001.57 --> 1006.6400000000001
not because of his suffering for the

1004.33 --> 1009.7900000000001
clarity it's just the craziness of the

1006.64 --> 1011.3199999999999
situation because I'm looking when this

1009.79 --> 1013.54
kind of thing happens with it I'm

1011.32 --> 1016.57
literally looking at it from both angles

1013.54 --> 1017.8
I'm looking from both sides as to what

1016.57 --> 1022.24
they're doing and I'm trying to

1017.8 --> 1025.9199999999998
determine what is going on in them and I

1022.24 --> 1030.429
find what I see just hysterically

1025.92 --> 1035.0790000000002
comical it is so human it is so silly an

1030.429 --> 1041.439
extravagant the whole situation in this

1035.079 --> 1045.81
moment and time that's it that's why I

1041.439 --> 1045.8100000000002
laugh for about when I laugh about it

1047.96 --> 1051.109
[Music]

1053.45 --> 1055.99
did

1059.28 --> 1065.93
do I have any questions about the glow

1061.65 --> 1070.19
Preston Parker yes your where's the

1065.93 --> 1075.27
where's the proof of your r-value

1070.19 --> 1079.3200000000002
where's the measured geometrically

1075.27 --> 1082.55
confirmed proof of this r-value that it

1079.32 --> 1085.62
that that is going to be part of a globe

1082.55 --> 1089.84
you know if it is a globe then it has an

1085.62 --> 1094.2299999999998
r-value and this is even accepted as

1089.84 --> 1097.32
being a standard value so how was that

1094.23 --> 1099.69
determined was it actually measured and

1097.32 --> 1102.12
geometrically confirmed or was it

1099.69 --> 1104.5800000000002
perhaps presupposed by putting punches

1102.12 --> 1108.9199999999998
sticks in the ground sorry now I

1104.58 --> 1117.51
answered your my question for me for you

1108.92 --> 1123.2
so our is old news it well doesn't a

1117.51 --> 1123.2
globe have a radius value star ecig dust

1126.95 --> 1132.559
no I have not read Riley's thesis but

1130.73 --> 1139.669
I've been listening to a lot of people

1132.559 --> 1142.7
talking about it hey dude

1139.669 --> 1153.529
here for lulz he asked me a question

1142.7 --> 1155.809
okay he asked me to ask if I had any

1153.529 --> 1159.139
questions why I gave him a question and

1155.809 --> 1168.44
now you're complaining to me I'm not

1159.139 --> 1172.399
asking you necessarily because it's 33

1168.44 --> 1174.8500000000001
pages long and I don't like reading all

1172.399 --> 1174.85
that much

1190.14 --> 1196.2
I look I may have read it it's just that

1193.74 --> 1197.49
I'm not this type of guy like oh wow

1196.2 --> 1201.059
great documents

1197.49 --> 1203.52
let's read all of that I don't really

1201.059 --> 1207.99
like reading all that much and sounds

1203.52 --> 1208.6399999999999
weird but I never really have that much

1207.99 --> 1211.759
although

1208.64 --> 1211.759
[Music]

1217.04 --> 1222.569
[Music]

1227.23 --> 1238.3
oh really is it now and and where did

1231.64 --> 1242.0400000000002
you get that that radius value in meters

1238.3 --> 1242.04
from Preston Parker

1251.61 --> 1260.9399999999998
also yeah well you know technically you

1258.12 --> 1265.05
know technically the earth is

1260.94 --> 1268.14
pear-shaped so how about the radius

1265.05 --> 1270.6599999999999
value from the north to the South Pole

1268.14 --> 1273.2
how about like that is that the same

1270.66 --> 1273.2
value

1279.54 --> 1282.1399999999999
the

1284.48 --> 1296.7
Google oh my god really you think I was

1292.44 --> 1298.3500000000001
just look trying to have you look up the

1296.7 --> 1301.5900000000001
value no that's not actually what I'm

1298.35 --> 1307.4699999999998
asking what I'm asking is how was that

1301.59 --> 1311.58
determined because I get that's a claim

1307.47 --> 1317.929
yeah there is a claim and you can google

1311.58 --> 1321.21
it that earth radius is 6,371 oh yes

1317.929 --> 1324.3600000000001
meters wait

1321.21 --> 1326.76
six million three hundred and seventy

1324.36 --> 1332.51
one thousand meters right that's the

1326.76 --> 1337.86
claim so how was that measured and

1332.51 --> 1342.12
geometrically confirmed because just a

1337.86 --> 1345.1789999999999
distance is not necessarily proof of a

1342.12 --> 1349.1399999999999
kind of a radius thing you have to first

1345.179 --> 1352.5
confirm that there is a geometry present

1349.14 --> 1360.39
in order for there to be a radius value

1352.5 --> 1363.6
possible see now I happen to know from

1360.39 --> 1366.8400000000001
experience that this radius value

1363.6 --> 1368.9099999999999
originally was determined by putting

1366.84 --> 1372.1699999999998
sticks in the ground and then comparing

1368.91 --> 1375.24
a celestial globe of the heavens is

1372.17 --> 1377.5800000000002
orientation in relation to the position

1375.24 --> 1380.67
of the earth presupposing the earth it

1377.58 --> 1383.1599999999999
surface is actually a globe wrapped

1380.67 --> 1386.67
underneath how this globe of the heavens

1383.16 --> 1390.99
is orientated and that is how the

1386.67 --> 1393.3300000000002
r-value was then determined but I wonder

1390.99 --> 1395.58
if it was any at any point just

1393.33 --> 1398.0
literally geometrically confirmed in

1395.58 --> 1398.0
some way

1402.99 --> 1409.42
because also yeah you might have caught

1406.03 --> 1414.18
on that from all the NASA pictures with

1409.42 --> 1417.0700000000002
all the globe Earth pictures right well

1414.18 --> 1419.95
they don't all seem to be the same scale

1417.07 --> 1422.26
so I don't know if you're going to use

1419.95 --> 1424.66
those as some kind of proof supposedly

1422.26 --> 1426.76
that little presupposing that NASA is

1424.66 --> 1430.66
reliable I'm willing to temporarily

1426.76 --> 1434.08
entertain that one in this case how do

1430.66 --> 1436.9
you explain the different sizes because

1434.08 --> 1438.34
yeah some continents and some pictures

1436.9 --> 1440.47
are just a little bit bigger

1438.34 --> 1442.6599999999999
relating to the suppose it ratios you're

1440.47 --> 1448.59
assuming from that picture and another

1442.66 --> 1454.45
time so that doesn't seem to be a stable

1448.59 --> 1462.76
are consistent our value to be deducted

1454.45 --> 1465.13
from that just saying so how was it

1462.76 --> 1467.85
actually geometrically confirmed this

1465.13 --> 1467.8500000000001
our value

1487.62 --> 1493.049
I was kind of addressing the ballers in

1490.169 --> 1495.38
chat you know I'm still hoping to get an

1493.049 --> 1495.3799999999999
answer

1506.0 --> 1509.039
[Music]

1510.57 --> 1520.47
you might be onto something there a GM

1513.42 --> 1524.6000000000001
or it may even be weirder maybe they're

1520.47 --> 1528.1200000000001
gonna subject them to hallucinate

1524.6 --> 1533.82
hallucinogenic weapons like spray them

1528.12 --> 1536.34
with weird gas so that with their

1533.82 --> 1538.4099999999999
mindset of them that they're going to be

1536.34 --> 1541.11
looking for something in their mind that

1538.41 --> 1544.3100000000002
they may then start to literally see

1541.11 --> 1550.11
that thing and that way have a giant

1544.31 --> 1557.07
amplification of the whole myth can you

1550.11 --> 1559.29
imagine that ed yep oh sorry I didn't

1557.07 --> 1565.6699999999998
see your question there sorry to

1559.29 --> 1565.67
Cosentino we're all set

1569.95 --> 1582.5800000000002
ah I can't see oh wait if I'm in the

1577.87 --> 1585.4799999999998
back of an open for that bat force happy

1582.58 --> 1585.48
mother does

1592.35 --> 1599.3999999999999
Sarita Cosentino that depends on if

1595.66 --> 1599.4
you're gonna have an open roof I don't

1605.85 --> 1611.9499999999998
does that answer your question oh by the

1608.38 --> 1615.42
way thank you for the super chat $1 from

1611.95 --> 1615.42
good servant thank you very much

1625.97 --> 1634.52
Nicholas that's ridiculous

1630.11 --> 1638.1499999999999
why would I need to convince Nathan to

1634.52 --> 1640.16
debate Bob okay it's Bob that needs

1638.15 --> 1643.67
convincing is the one that seems to be

1640.16 --> 1649.6100000000001
completely unwilling to debate people

1643.67 --> 1651.77
not Nathan and I don't know about Reds

1649.61 --> 1654.37
look I don't know anything about that

1651.77 --> 1654.37
guy so

1661.21 --> 1664.289
[Music]

1683.19 --> 1690.65
now Dell West Watson NASA has a very big

1687.09 --> 1690.6499999999999
tape measure okay

1699.72 --> 1707.65
well maybe you could ask a little bit

1702.61 --> 1712.6299999999999
less like a seven yay look I'm getting a

1707.65 --> 1715.92
lot of chat so circumference of Earth

1712.63 --> 1715.92
divided but

1722.6 --> 1732.049
oh really so you're gonna presuppose a

1725.539 --> 1734.889
circumference there and then subject

1732.049 --> 1738.9189999999999
that to mathematics that's fascinating

1734.889 --> 1742.399
well again you have that value but

1738.919 --> 1747.95
you're presupposing the radius literally

1742.399 --> 1752.12
in that sentence there so that's not the

1747.95 --> 1756.039
geometrical measured proof I was looking

1752.12 --> 1756.039
for Preston Parker

1766.18 --> 1770.8990000000001
[Music]

1768.299 --> 1770.899
and

1857.6 --> 1872.33
yep about that no I'm still here it's

1863.82 --> 1872.33
just all that T so let's [ __ ] up again

1872.76 --> 1878.359
[Music]

1881.0 --> 1891.48
no Preston parking your your red herring

1884.97 --> 1893.6100000000001
me I didn't want you to measure it

1891.48 --> 1896.22
providing the glue that's not measuring

1893.61 --> 1900.6599999999999
that's mathematically deducing what you

1896.22 --> 1903.63
did based on a presupposition that it is

1900.66 --> 1907.5900000000001
a circumference of a globe literally

1903.63 --> 1912.0600000000002
that's literally what you said do I need

1907.59 --> 1916.55
to repeat what you said I'll do that no

1912.06 --> 1920.96
problem all right

1916.55 --> 1924.74
was it the circumference of Earth

1920.96 --> 1927.0900000000001
divided by PI there you go

1924.74 --> 1930.38
this your conference of Earth that's

1927.09 --> 1930.3799999999999
literally where you're starting

1934.52 --> 1943.97
what is the circumference of earth is

1937.91 --> 1946.16
that a circle that spans a globe is that

1943.97 --> 1948.41
what you're starting out with so you're

1946.16 --> 1953.98
that's literally starting out assuming

1948.41 --> 1953.98
it is a glow just for your information

1984.44 --> 1990.24
[Music]

1987.16 --> 1990.24
this is

1992.9 --> 2000.1000000000001
no that's what I was supposed to do no

1998.45 --> 2003.18
that's what you think that's not what I

2000.1 --> 2003.1799999999998
said you didn't listen

2013.06 --> 2021.73
I had a question about the globe but it

2017.38 --> 2024.73
wasn't necessarily a question about the

2021.73 --> 2027.4
model because I know the data about the

2024.73 --> 2031.5
Spotted model I know it's there I asked

2027.4 --> 2037.5400000000002
a question about it mainly a

2031.5 --> 2040.5
verification empirical verification that

2037.54 --> 2045.0
wasn't what I was basically asking for a

2040.5 --> 2049.57
geometrically measured confirmed our

2045.0 --> 2053.34
value that you can say okay we actually

2049.57 --> 2060.52
physically measured it and it is

2053.34 --> 2063.2200000000003
undeniably thing else that because it

2060.52 --> 2065.97
matches geometrically with all the

2063.22 --> 2065.97
aspects

2070.71 --> 2077.429
anyway uh yeah I had a bit of an early

2074.879 --> 2085.589
start today to make up for being late

2077.429 --> 2088.98
yesterday now God Bailey Sunday let's

2085.589 --> 2092.7599999999998
not get into Coriolis again and we

2088.98 --> 2095.309
always have to that look the whole

2092.76 --> 2097.429
Coriolis confusion is spinning out of

2095.309 --> 2097.429
control

2097.48 --> 2102.38
[Music]

2099.349 --> 2102.38
pun intended

2108.589 --> 2114.89
it's never gonna end

2111.41 --> 2117.839
it's literally spiraling out of control

2114.89 --> 2125.7599999999998
in their minds because in the real world

2117.839 --> 2129.71
there is no spinning no it's really a

2125.76 --> 2134.059
there is no spoon level effect here

2129.71 --> 2134.059
there is no Coriolis effect

2143.81 --> 2153.14
I can imagine it all you like but these

2150.35 --> 2158.15
spinning does not correlate with actual

2153.14 --> 2161.18
empirical data I know exactly how the

2158.15 --> 2165.26
model should be and do and all that but

2161.18 --> 2166.66
the empirical confirmations are missing

2165.26 --> 2169.1000000000004
[Music]

2166.66 --> 2171.5299999999997
because one way or the other

2169.1 --> 2173.99
whatever the earth may be okay weather

2171.53 --> 2179.51
is a globe or it's a flat stationary

2173.99 --> 2182.6
thing right there cannot be any Coriolis

2179.51 --> 2184.9700000000003
effect if you end up arguing that the

2182.6 --> 2186.86
air is moving lockstep with the earth

2184.97 --> 2189.62
if you presuppose the earth is moving

2186.86 --> 2196.88
then there is no Coriolis effect none of

2189.62 --> 2199.7599999999998
it and if the earth is flat a stationary

2196.88 --> 2202.13
there is also no Coriolis effect you

2199.76 --> 2204.92
know you can presuppose with the globe

2202.13 --> 2207.7400000000002
whatever you like you know there's no

2204.92 --> 2210.67
need for that freakin Coriolis nonsense

2207.74 --> 2212.8399999999997
to stay there it is from Newtonian era

2210.67 --> 2215.1800000000003
literally that's what that Coriolis

2212.84 --> 2218.36
nonsense was born from it says the

2215.18 --> 2225.7999999999997
science story level attuned to the 19th

2218.36 --> 2227.9900000000002
century from that time and it's been

2225.8 --> 2231.11
discarded anyway the whole Newtonian

2227.99 --> 2233.47
thing isn't discarded and the Coriolis

2231.11 --> 2236.36
should also be discarded by your

2233.47 --> 2238.73
priesthood standards and it's ridiculous

2236.36 --> 2243.6800000000003
that this Coriolis confusion keeps on

2238.73 --> 2245.81
persisting because no matter what you're

2243.68 --> 2248.0299999999997
going to be presupposing it's not going

2245.81 --> 2251.87
to be there and if you claim it is there

2248.03 --> 2253.84
then yeah you can just immediately draw

2251.87 --> 2256.91
conclusions from that that are not

2253.84 --> 2259.34
empirically proven to the contrary and

2256.91 --> 2263.93
that's the whole point so it is

2259.34 --> 2265.79
literally useless to keep pursuing this

2263.93 --> 2267.6499999999996
idea that there must be some kind of

2265.79 --> 2272.5299999999997
Coriolis effect because the earth is a

2267.65 --> 2276.23
ball spinning it is completely useless

2272.53 --> 2276.7200000000003
for the ballers mainly and for us just I

2276.23 --> 2284.01
don't know

2276.72 --> 2285.81
gives me a headache how many times can

2284.01 --> 2289.369
you hear the same thing over and over

2285.81 --> 2289.369
and over again you know

2297.59 --> 2311.84
all right really Sunday sorry I just

2302.21 --> 2313.96
went off in a tangent the Sun and Moon

2311.84 --> 2319.79
are traveling I don't know traveling

2313.96 --> 2323.96
suggests location on the other hand it

2319.79 --> 2325.52
could be angular travel sure but I don't

2323.96 --> 2330.23
really I really don't think they're

2325.52 --> 2334.67
objects of any sort not what is

2330.23 --> 2338.18
presented to us in our view anyway and

2334.67 --> 2341.3
also not beyond that I think there

2338.18 --> 2346.46
really is no specific location this

2341.3 --> 2352.27
light is coming from although I could

2346.46 --> 2352.27
still be proven wrong at that you know

2353.44 --> 2362.4500000000003
weirdly enough even free energy

2359.12 --> 2365.5099999999998
he made an animation about it about how

2362.45 --> 2370.25
he is assuming that the daylight works

2365.51 --> 2373.3100000000004
and he drew basically like a flower it

2370.25 --> 2378.29
it seemed to be working like that like

2373.31 --> 2380.89
the trajectory of the light but yeah in

2378.29 --> 2387.14
a holographic kind of way it's like he

2380.89 --> 2388.8799999999997
supposes that light is like fourth

2387.14 --> 2391.4
dimensional but not as in the fourth

2388.88 --> 2395.2400000000002
dimensional of that time but rather

2391.4 --> 2397.2200000000003
another ad space deeper that it

2395.24 --> 2402.62
functions like that and so it's it's

2397.22 --> 2405.56
pretty complex stuff but it could

2402.62 --> 2407.75
according to that concept according to

2405.56 --> 2409.7
that model he showed in the 3d animation

2407.75 --> 2412.94
of it on the rectangular looping earth

2409.7 --> 2415.31
that could mean that there may be a very

2412.94 --> 2419.21
specific weird origin point of this

2415.31 --> 2423.83
light manifestation oh let's get there

2419.21 --> 2427.1
let's get a fly something exactly at

2423.83 --> 2428.4
that specific spot and see if there is

2427.1 --> 2430.95
anything

2428.4 --> 2432.539
cause who knows you know I think most of

2430.95 --> 2434.73
the heavenly bodies Bend away but I

2432.539 --> 2436.6800000000003
could be slightly wrong with the Sun

2434.73 --> 2442.0190000000002
there may actually be some kind of weird

2436.68 --> 2444.3289999999997
origin point like a focal point where on

2442.019 --> 2446.6699999999996
the other side of the platform it's like

2444.329 --> 2450.3900000000003
where an electric charge that manifests

2446.67 --> 2451.7400000000002
in light like that that just goes around

2450.39 --> 2453.359
in a circle

2451.74 --> 2456.839
yeah well not in a circle in a straight

2453.359 --> 2467.88
line in this case with the slides up and

2456.839 --> 2470.4
down as it goes yeah I don't know so it

2467.88 --> 2475.65
seems that most of it is holographic in

2470.4 --> 2482.009
nature but who knows with the Sun I I'd

2475.65 --> 2484.2200000000003
have to see okay yeah that's not gonna

2482.009 --> 2484.22
help

2486.42 --> 2489.86
don't spam my jet

2500.4 --> 2504.869
flat earth is great as a reference but

2502.829 --> 2512.579
only up to the equator what are you

2504.869 --> 2514.859
talking about 5% gaming now it's called

2512.579 --> 2516.96
spamming if you got something to say

2514.859 --> 2518.819
then put it all in a single sentence and

2516.96 --> 2521.4900000000002
don't spread it out with a bunch of

2518.819 --> 2523.89
words unless you're just gonna say those

2521.49 --> 2527.549
bunch of words and then shut up for a

2523.89 --> 2529.319
while you're just gonna keep on typing

2527.549 --> 2540.5389999999998
one word at a time that's called

2529.319 --> 2542.16
spamming in my book anyway right anyway

2540.539 --> 2545.46
I think that what you were probably

2542.16 --> 2548.97
talking about is the disk model the flat

2545.46 --> 2553.259
earth disk model that every almost every

2548.97 --> 2557.4599999999996
single baller out there demands the

2553.259 --> 2565.88
strawman us or me usually with because I

2557.46 --> 2570.829
don't assume that at all open to these

2565.88 --> 2575.089
you know my model rectangular looping

2570.829 --> 2577.44
the equators is according to my

2575.089 --> 2582.119
conceptualization of this rectangular

2577.44 --> 2587.9990000000003
looping model a straight line as is the

2582.119 --> 2591.119
trajectory of the Sun and the moon over

2587.999 --> 2594.029
the earth but as we see it as everything

2591.119 --> 2596.13
is actually displayed because I don't

2594.029 --> 2599.64
think that's visible it's there they are

2596.13 --> 2601.859
not in a specific place but it can be

2599.64 --> 2603.779
modelled that way as well because

2601.859 --> 2606.45
everything that is visual up there on

2603.779 --> 2609.48
the globe of the heavens and I presume

2606.45 --> 2616.2
also the Sun at it or at least the Sun

2609.48 --> 2620.5190000000002
that we see is only visible at the edge

2616.2 --> 2625.14
of vision as a then my globe around us

2620.519 --> 2627.72
until the horizon presenting as light's

2625.14 --> 2629.62
not coming from any literal specific

2627.72 --> 2633.1299999999997
point that we see there

2629.62 --> 2637.5699999999997
because if we change our position then

2633.13 --> 2648.34
so do the lights relative position to us

2637.57 --> 2650.65
change including vertically when you

2648.34 --> 2653.31
change your position vertically it also

2650.65 --> 2653.31
changes

2663.14 --> 2670.19
okay why are there only freakin glowers

2666.3 --> 2670.19
in my chat here where is everybody gone

2671.42 --> 2674.42
you

2687.16 --> 2702.25
it's thanks yeah you're just here

2697.97 --> 2706.48
listening I know it's just that these

2702.25 --> 2706.48
clovers are spamming my chats

2732.15 --> 2740.37
all right don't drink from the grapple

2735.75 --> 2742.95
tea and that is another way to say

2740.37 --> 2746.22
gravity don't drink from the gravity

2742.95 --> 2750.56
because I should drink from that it's

2746.22 --> 2750.56
very difficult to get off and again

2754.8 --> 2758.069
[Music]

2761.19 --> 2779.2400000000002
this is not gravity by the way this is

2763.92 --> 2779.2400000000002
green tea right

2791.64 --> 2798.66
that's ridiculous look here for the lulz

2795.24 --> 2800.5499999999997
I don't ignore you okay this is just

2798.66 --> 2802.83
annoying when people do that all the

2800.55 --> 2807.3
time when they say something and it's

2802.83 --> 2809.58
look it I am I am doing something here

2807.3 --> 2811.6800000000003
I'm talking to an audience I'm not a

2809.58 --> 2813.96
freaking puppet you can just freakin

2811.68 --> 2816.1499999999996
insert a coin in and then expect me to

2813.96 --> 2818.55
literally answer whatever you're saying

2816.15 --> 2824.9
two seconds later okay

2818.55 --> 2834.9
stop being such a whiny [ __ ] please

2824.9 --> 2836.9100000000003
okay right as for your question would it

2834.9 --> 2840.78
be correct to say that there is no proof

2836.91 --> 2844.92
or bloap disk or rectangle just a lot of

2840.78 --> 2847.19
prism presumptions well no that's not

2844.92 --> 2847.19
true

2849.02 --> 2855.24
there are definite hints there are

2851.73 --> 2858.51
geometrical aspects that we can already

2855.24 --> 2862.74
clearly deduce like which one of them is

2858.51 --> 2864.9900000000002
the most prevalent in empirical data in

2862.74 --> 2867.77
empirical in the empirical proof the

2864.99 --> 2873.4799999999996
flat aspect of it the geometrical

2867.77 --> 2876.21
straightness for everything that makes

2873.48 --> 2879.48
the disk somewhat viable makes the

2876.21 --> 2882.0
rectangular looping system also very

2879.48 --> 2886.04
viable doesn't make the globe or a

2882.0 --> 2886.04
concave system viable at all

2900.1 --> 2907.87
lotty shut up why would you bring that

2905.18 --> 2907.87
up here

2934.1 --> 2943.1
yeah it's called critical thinking 5%

2937.16 --> 2947.74
gaming I am strict I don't Bowl [ __ ]

2943.1 --> 2947.74
around I'm serious with what I do

2956.79 --> 2960.88
and I can make jokes here and there but

2959.29 --> 2963.94
overall when it comes to the real

2960.88 --> 2967.71
arguments and the technicalities I am

2963.94 --> 2967.71
very very serious

2989.34 --> 2998.8700000000003
hello Jose no not gonna read anything of

2994.32 --> 2998.8700000000003
that out loud but that's very funny

3003.16 --> 3014.72
it doesn't 5% gaming it doesn't fail at

3010.4 --> 3018.17
all because yeah whatever

3014.72 --> 3021.14
the equator orientation is if it's a

3018.17 --> 3025.19
circle or straight line or even in

3021.14 --> 3027.29
incomplete arc which would be even more

3025.19 --> 3029.6
confusing to most of us I know the

3027.29 --> 3032.57
implications of that absolutely fine

3029.6 --> 3035.0299999999997
without any kind of hindrance to me

3032.57 --> 3038.05
although I know that just the vast

3035.03 --> 3040.82
majority people are just gonna go up

3038.05 --> 3044.27
yeah because it is so confusing

3040.82 --> 3046.34
no their stupid little brains that are

3044.27 --> 3048.44
just used to relying on everybody else

3046.34 --> 3052.81
and think for them can't handle yeah

3048.44 --> 3056.23
yeah I have no problem with that at all

3052.81 --> 3059.57
so no none of the Flat Earth

3056.23 --> 3061.25
conceptualized models of any issues with

3059.57 --> 3070.07
whatever the equator is going to turn

3061.25 --> 3073.72
out to be really hello so yeah nice try

3070.07 --> 3073.7200000000003
except not really

3080.44 --> 3092.91
[Music]

3088.98 --> 3092.91
down out of tea

3105.61 --> 3113.28
flat earth model passes the sky gazing

3109.48 --> 3113.28
that what okay

3119.28 --> 3121.9700000000003
No

3128.8 --> 3137.53
you're annoying a [ __ ] dude and you're

3135.4 --> 3140.32
trying to savonia the [ __ ] out of me I'm

3137.53 --> 3143.1400000000003
not taking it okay five percent in

3140.32 --> 3147.8500000000004
gaming it's all just a bunch of straw

3143.14 --> 3150.22
Manning you don't even understand [ __ ]

3147.85 --> 3152.08
about any flat earth model you just

3150.22 --> 3154.33
looked at something you heard a Flat

3152.08 --> 3156.61
Earth or make it clumsy explanation and

3154.33 --> 3157.45
you think that that is it because you're

3156.61 --> 3159.7000000000003
[ __ ]

3157.45 --> 3162.16
you can't think beyond your own ideas

3159.7 --> 3170.1299999999997
you're stupid you're a dumbass

3162.16 --> 3170.1299999999997
5% gaming and now you're in a timeout

3170.22 --> 3176.5
because I'm sick of you filling your

3173.85 --> 3179.43
yeah filling my chat up with your straw

3176.5 --> 3179.43
Manning [ __ ]

3186.69 --> 3189.96
tangerine time

3197.9 --> 3206.2200000000003
lotty there's plenty of models there's

3201.9 --> 3212.13
plenty of models on Flat Earth but it

3206.22 --> 3214.1899999999996
doesn't really mean anything it doesn't

3212.13 --> 3217.2000000000003
really mean anything unless there is

3214.19 --> 3222.119
certain levels of empirical data to back

3217.2 --> 3224.8489999999997
it up and if there is much the left or

3222.119 --> 3226.7000000000003
much left to be presupposed about the

3224.849 --> 3231.75
model whatever you're going to be doing

3226.7 --> 3234.359
then it's literally not relevant because

3231.75 --> 3239.25
you don't know if the continuation of

3234.359 --> 3241.47
your reasoning is even gonna be yeah if

3239.25 --> 3243.119
you could ever confirm it so then you're

3241.47 --> 3246.569
just gonna be working on science fiction

3243.119 --> 3252.5
based on presupposition just like the

3246.569 --> 3252.5
movies so it's just a waste of time

3264.96 --> 3267.9990000000003
[Music]

3296.79 --> 3298.82
Oh

3311.45 --> 3314.54
[Music]

3323.47 --> 3329.0099999999998
now I usually end up banning Savannah is

3326.17 --> 3329.01
in sock troll

3347.73 --> 3351.64
but who knows you know everyone can have

3350.319 --> 3353.68
a chiffon yay day

3351.64 --> 3356.8289999999997
sometimes all not everyone but some

3353.68 --> 3362.279
people so if somebody's been is behaving

3356.829 --> 3364.8390000000004
like that a day I'll just tie them out

3362.279 --> 3367.029
but if they keep on doing that like

3364.839 --> 3368.65
every single time they join my chat yeah

3367.029 --> 3374.38
you'll be banned and then I'll ban all

3368.65 --> 3380.64
your socks and you will never speak in

3374.38 --> 3380.6400000000003
my chat again it's very simple

3412.53 --> 3423.8590000000004
hey hello to meet King yeah the weekend

3421.17 --> 3423.859
is here

3431.98 --> 3442.93
and it's gonna get yeah I'm gonna have a

3434.42 --> 3442.9300000000003
lot of fun I think mm-hmm thank you

3450.77 --> 3457.5
yeah anyway on Friday there's one of my

3454.62 --> 3459.5099999999998
favorite yeah

3457.5 --> 3463.8
comedy sketch video makers that I've

3459.51 --> 3466.05
been following for insane amounts of

3463.8 --> 3468.7200000000003
time I think probably 15 years or

3466.05 --> 3471.48
something he's still going it's kind of

3468.72 --> 3474.87
weird I like it and he does something

3471.48 --> 3476.64
almost every Friday so I always have

3474.87 --> 3480.17
that to look forward to again he gets

3476.64 --> 3483.48
very silly and I just love it yeah and

3480.17 --> 3488.4900000000002
also Monday I'm gonna be doing gaming

3483.48 --> 3497.22
again my D&D group looking forward to

3488.49 --> 3501.0299999999997
that I think at least not sure anyway I

3497.22 --> 3503.91
think was planned for this Monday after

3501.03 --> 3506.3300000000004
double check if it's still gonna go

3503.91 --> 3506.33
through

3531.35 --> 3539.2999999999997
Wow well at least I got to warm up

3535.1 --> 3543.86
everyone for for some housekeeping

3539.3 --> 3546.4100000000003
questions I think I think it's good to

3543.86 --> 3548.33
sometimes just go over the r-value a

3546.41 --> 3551.12
little bit more because it is so basic

3548.33 --> 3556.13
it's such a fundamental kindergarten

3551.12 --> 3558.65
basic thing actually that there's not a

3556.13 --> 3560.51
lot to say about it really every time

3558.65 --> 3566.48
it's not there's no bit development even

3560.51 --> 3572.03
ballers kind of ignore that but it's

3566.48 --> 3573.86
still kind of important to see see what

3572.03 --> 3576.32
it is and how the train of thought

3573.86 --> 3583.79
really works is one of the first most

3576.32 --> 3587.3
blatant presuppositional systems like

3583.79 --> 3591.8
it's it's mathematical footing based on

3587.3 --> 3595.9900000000002
assumption to basically start imagining

3591.8 --> 3599.51
that curve must be there because of that

3595.99 --> 3601.52
presupposition that's a good way to

3599.51 --> 3604.13
approach that so you don't have to

3601.52 --> 3606.17
imagine it or you don't have to actually

3604.13 --> 3609.65
then see it anymore you can just imagine

3606.17 --> 3611.57
that part and then that gap within the

3609.65 --> 3617.98
personal the person's conscious is

3611.57 --> 3630.38
filled for the dream or the belief dream

3617.98 --> 3632.86
so fine yeah I mean oh my god that is

3630.38 --> 3632.86
terrible

3633.67 --> 3639.46
Dungeons and Dragons seriously

3641.13 --> 3647.21
that's just terrible anyway sky

3643.86 --> 3649.94
multi-joint Nardini group no no

3647.21 --> 3653.4
definitely not

3649.94 --> 3659.79
we already have a British person in my

3653.4 --> 3661.4100000000003
group have a good day our wind keep up

3659.79 --> 3663.69
the great work Thank You Amanda young

3661.41 --> 3666.02
also for the super 4 dollar ship which a

3663.69 --> 3666.02
donation

3674.11 --> 3680.65
now if it's pronounced drag region then

3677.67 --> 3683.28
there needs to be an extra eye behind

3680.65 --> 3683.28
the GA

3692.61 --> 3700.59
all right anyway this is silly chat

3697.19 --> 3704.66
still was kind of good show I do feel

3700.59 --> 3707.28
much better than in the last few weeks

3704.66 --> 3709.5299999999997
it's just this facial and maybe just

3707.28 --> 3712.53
need to take a power nap for 10 minutes

3709.53 --> 3715.05
or something wake up and try to remember

3712.53 --> 3722.07
what I've dreamt because it's probably

3715.05 --> 3732.6600000000003
gonna happen so this is oh really

3722.07 --> 3732.9900000000002
I know see see see how I am not doing

3732.66 --> 3738.18
that

3732.99 --> 3741.2099999999996
and besides Dungeons and Dragons 2-pound

3738.18 --> 3745.68
super chat donation he makes a funny

3741.21 --> 3749.76
joke he made a caricature joke based on

3745.68 --> 3752.6
me my association my D&D group just like

3749.76 --> 3756.57
the other account of our wins

3752.6 --> 3760.38
