22.56 --> 39.599999999999994
[Music]

35.899 --> 43.59
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

39.6 --> 47.61
early-bird number 127 I'm your host

43.59 --> 52.17
Arwen and today it's quite a nice day

47.61 --> 55.68
actually it's not as stormy as it has

52.17 --> 59.67
been the last few days it's actually

55.68 --> 65.009
nice and sunny blue sky a couple of

59.67 --> 69.479
clouds here and there this morning there

65.009 --> 71.61
was a big cloud floating over and some

69.479 --> 73.64
rain did come out but yeah it cleared up

71.61 --> 76.64
it's nice

73.64 --> 76.64
sunny

76.77 --> 79.579
so yeah

81.03 --> 85.97
that was up really early again today

89.119 --> 96.399
I I tried to watch the video but

92.63 --> 96.399
couldn't get myself to do it

96.46 --> 103.88
yeah I was drinking someone didn't

101.24 --> 106.90899999999999
exactly help so I felt like okay if I'm

103.88 --> 111.1
gonna watch that [ __ ] now it's gonna be

106.909 --> 111.10000000000001
worse so I'm I haven't actually seen it

114.799 --> 119.02000000000001
I don't want to I don't want to see it

120.2 --> 127.42
but yeah I will have to eventually

123.31 --> 127.42
getting mixed signals

130.56 --> 139.83
though yeah it does seem like it it was

136.2 --> 143.22
probably real from all the angles that

139.83 --> 145.74
I'm getting at and instead of the fake

143.22 --> 147.93
or not fake people that are really

145.74 --> 152.61
diving into the information seem to be

147.93 --> 156.87
more focused about the but the

152.61 --> 160.20000000000002
psychological warfare of what they did

156.87 --> 164.66
rather than questioning it if it was

160.2 --> 164.66
real or not I think it's probably real

165.86 --> 169.25
not for sure

171.98 --> 180.38
yeah also Jose's band that's right

185.28 --> 192.75
because you're a sociopath [ __ ] and I

189.93 --> 195.56
don't want you anywhere near my show for

192.75 --> 195.56
some time to come

205.61 --> 211.79000000000002
yeah he's banned for what he did

208.19 --> 214.63
yesterday and it doesn't seem to care

211.79 --> 214.63
about it at all

221.59 --> 229.12
and what did he do wrong well yesterday

224.41 --> 231.67
I was with Rhys and peanuts Clark here

229.12 --> 235.3
and yeah

231.67 --> 239.64999999999998
Rhys was going through some really tough

235.3 --> 243.94
times yeah it hurt him bad

239.65 --> 248.23000000000002
the whole situation and he just came in

243.94 --> 250.63
like oh hello sorry but I'm gonna

248.23 --> 252.099
advertise for my show that's it like

250.63 --> 260.46999999999997
right in the middle of it that's just

252.099 --> 262.95
nasty and yeah I don't tolerate that

260.47 --> 262.95000000000005
kind of behavior

275.33 --> 281.65999999999997
not saying I'm gonna bed him permanently

278.06 --> 283.22
forever but in the comment period I

281.66 --> 285.73
don't want to have anything to do with

283.22 --> 285.73
this guy

287.53 --> 293.80999999999995
yes beta vanilla Reese is from New

291.08 --> 298.07
Zealand and his mother actually lives in

293.81 --> 301.64
Christchurch and yeah this is a really

298.07 --> 305.9
heartfelt warm and loving and

301.64 --> 308.3
nationalist guy and he cares a lot about

305.9 --> 314.81
what happened it really really hurt him

308.3 --> 319.25
and a lot of New Zealanders and yeah you

314.81 --> 322.16
can't just waltz over that like it's

319.25 --> 328.49
some kind of like it's nothing special

322.16 --> 332.75
or anything it hurts them a lot and Eric

328.49 --> 334.67
came in and proceeded to be a dick but

332.75 --> 338.18
yeah I expect that kind of [ __ ] of Eric

334.67 --> 344.18
because he always does that they kicked

338.18 --> 347.05
him out but yeah

344.18 --> 347.05
at least

349.75 --> 357.04
at least he it's hard to explain he's

354.67 --> 359.11
just that's just how Eric does things he

357.04 --> 362.17
always does that he always soon as

359.11 --> 364.33000000000004
something gets tight or stressful he

362.17 --> 366.51
always go so everything is about the

364.33 --> 370.15
state it's all only the state nobody

366.51 --> 373.75
does anything evil unless the state

370.15 --> 379.84
makes them do that that kind of nonsense

373.75 --> 388.63
and it's annoying but yeah that's how

379.84 --> 390.72999999999996
Eric does things always and look if we'd

388.63 --> 393.21999999999997
asked him in retrospect he'd probably

390.73 --> 397.72
recognized that he was being an [ __ ]

393.22 --> 400.78000000000003
and I don't know with Jose it's just

397.72 --> 405.07000000000005
different because it just doesn't feel

400.78 --> 408.21999999999997
it at all by the way thank you earlier

405.07 --> 411.81
Sean Tibbets for the two pounds a super

408.22 --> 411.81
chair donation much appreciated

414.73 --> 425.01
I need what why would you say that well

421.87 --> 425.01
what are you doing

438.0 --> 444.76
the bilgey in America this sort of thing

442.12 --> 448.63
seems to be happening a lot and there is

444.76 --> 455.88
some very provable fakery happening

448.63 --> 460.08
there and people being guided steered

455.88 --> 464.77
helped out perhaps by Secret Service or

460.08 --> 468.41999999999996
some kind of shadowy group but the New

464.77 --> 468.41999999999996
Zealand it doesn't happen there

471.46 --> 479.71
there's odd circumstances surrounding

475.27 --> 481.87
like how it ever got to that point but

479.71 --> 486.54999999999995
it's just not the same thing because it

481.87 --> 490.78000000000003
yeah it never happened before and in

486.55 --> 493.63
America yeah that there is a reason to

490.78 --> 496.35999999999996
start out doubting if something like

493.63 --> 500.169
that happened really got to look into

496.36 --> 503.65000000000003
the evidence first what is there to be

500.169 --> 506.40999999999997
sure whether it is real or not but yeah

503.65 --> 510.9
in this situation the guy filmed you

506.41 --> 514.15
know apparently and yeah that's that's

510.9 --> 516.39
much more forward evidence than we

514.15 --> 520.18
usually get to see with American

516.39 --> 526.51
situations that can turn out to be false

520.18 --> 531.13
flags so and I again so see London no I

526.51 --> 534.459
didn't watch it can put myself to

531.13 --> 539.2
watching it just the idea makes me feel

534.459 --> 544.079
nauseated and I just need some more time

539.2 --> 547.6700000000001
to basically prepare myself to do that

544.079 --> 547.67
still have it on my computer

556.37 --> 563.0
yeah and basically find myself

559.27 --> 568.6999999999999
distracting a lot so I've been diving

563.0 --> 572.06
into new computer games silly ones

568.7 --> 575.9000000000001
online stuff another game that I haven't

572.06 --> 579.76
tried out in a while and just getting

575.9 --> 579.76
myself distracted from all the [ __ ]

585.31 --> 591.16
yes that's right sauce alone I know it

588.43 --> 593.519
will affect me that kind of [ __ ] always

591.16 --> 593.519
does

608.09 --> 614.25
what

610.81 --> 623.8199999999999
but useful what are you talking about

614.25 --> 623.82
Saudi a Saudi come compound what

625.79 --> 632.06
Oh God I went to bed early yesterday I

630.2 --> 635.95
don't know I don't know what else has

632.06 --> 635.9499999999999
been discovered or figured out or

640.11 --> 644.91
that Mossad compound

642.46 --> 644.9100000000001
really

650.06 --> 657.7399999999999
okay so where did you where did you

654.029 --> 657.74
learn that where did you hear that from

674.199 --> 679.91
Milty you don't know the reasoning

676.459 --> 685.279
behind it I thought it was pretty pretty

679.91 --> 688.579
clear-cut it's to create a race war to

685.279 --> 690.319
create war and friction and agitation

688.579 --> 694.87
and conflict

690.319 --> 694.87
pretty pretty straightforward

698.07 --> 711.389
oh [ __ ] okay right yeah and of course

707.519 --> 713.579
more gun control is trying to be forced

711.389 --> 716.699
on the people in New Zealand because of

713.579 --> 718.829
this everyone was expecting that but I

716.699 --> 722.16
don't know what are you exactly what do

718.829 --> 727.92
you mean with a Mossad compound what

722.16 --> 730.5
does that mean are you saying the Mossad

727.92 --> 736.31
is somehow involved in that in that

730.5 --> 736.31
groups formation or training or

739.75 --> 745.879
did he confess to this or something or

744.23 --> 748.48
what's going on where are you getting

745.879 --> 748.48
this information

752.25 --> 764.93
I don't know what the old eighty Darko

759.12 --> 764.93
is that new site

777.04 --> 782.43
right okay

779.8 --> 782.43
thought so

784.74 --> 791.76
look it's pretty obvious that CIA and

788.67 --> 795.4799999999999
the Mossad are very widespread around in

791.76 --> 797.7
the world they just are that doesn't

795.48 --> 801.3000000000001
mean that they are the cause of all

797.7 --> 805.25
things that's you got to figure out

801.3 --> 805.25
every time if that is the case or not

807.5 --> 814.59
just because they are near doesn't mean

811.53 --> 819.4499999999999
that they are automatically the cause or

814.59 --> 822.26
even involved it's just jumping to

819.45 --> 822.26
conclusions

835.0 --> 842.699
right yeah bill gee you you could

838.029 --> 842.699
consider that it was like a

843.84 --> 852.69
for nation initiation it's very complex

849.11 --> 859.35
how to interpret something like this got

852.69 --> 863.57
the bid yeah very surreal but could have

859.35 --> 870.779
been it like that it's he's basically

863.57 --> 874.1
migrating to the other side but yeah

870.779 --> 877.95
whether that is even real or just a

874.1 --> 883.32
fairy tale they all believe in Sparta

877.95 --> 887.3000000000001
see as the 180° reality I'll never know

883.32 --> 887.3000000000001
don't care to find out

889.65 --> 901.02
but yeah whatever he did it's it's about

893.49 --> 905.87
as anti logos as you can get and yeah in

901.02 --> 905.87
this world that is what really matters

910.92 --> 915.77
it clearly was not a mistake on his side

921.28 --> 923.85
anyway

946.02 --> 955.5
yeah velji yep as a baseline I did I

950.91 --> 958.8299999999999
agree from the responses of other people

955.5 --> 963.87
that have seen it like even dejan took a

958.83 --> 965.839
look at it and maybe it's a Slavic thing

963.87 --> 969.0600000000001
or something but he's not very

965.839 --> 971.85
touchy-feely about it so he just roughly

969.06 --> 973.92
analyzed and just put it out there I had

971.85 --> 976.77
to like say okay dude you're you're in

973.92 --> 980.1899999999999
with rece in the room just try to be a

976.77 --> 983.76
little bit sensitive about it but he had

980.19 --> 988.1400000000001
his doubts but in retrospect he did say

983.76 --> 990.81
like yeah there weren't like clear-cut

988.14 --> 995.88
signs that it must have been faked it's

990.81 --> 999.8
just so then I trust his intuition in

995.88 --> 1003.38
that as well as for a lot of people so

999.8 --> 1006.43
nobody's really stepping forward with a

1003.38 --> 1010.7
clear-cut analysis of the video

1006.43 --> 1013.52
explaining in detail why it is faked it

1010.7 --> 1015.32
just seems to be a general suspicion and

1013.52 --> 1017.39
people are analyzing it but there's

1015.32 --> 1020.839
nobody really coming forward saying like

1017.39 --> 1023.949
I have the absolute proof here that it

1020.839 --> 1027.5
has to be faked or that it's been edited

1023.949 --> 1030.709
it still remains just a suspicion and as

1027.5 --> 1037.329
Reis asked on my show yesterday good

1030.709 --> 1041.9
some somebody that has skill in in CGI

1037.329 --> 1048.37
forensics please help analyze the video

1041.9 --> 1052.779
to see if it was faked and what and how

1048.37 --> 1055.57
and yeah until we get some of that it's

1052.779 --> 1058.51
gonna remain our personal sizing up of

1055.57 --> 1061.3899999999999
the thing and from what I've heard

1058.51 --> 1065.8799999999999
on average it's pretty straightforward

1061.39 --> 1065.88
that it's real so

1089.64 --> 1098.73
the Voynich how do you even know the guy

1093.27 --> 1103.67
was untrained okay I say it's very

1098.73 --> 1103.67
likely that he had trained for that [ __ ]

1122.12 --> 1138.26
I would know I haven't actually seen the

1134.26 --> 1140.39
violent action parts of the video just

1138.26 --> 1147.919
some snippets from what they showed on

1140.39 --> 1151.25
other media I don't care to look but

1147.919 --> 1153.65
yeah just look at the manifest he wrote

1151.25 --> 1156.679
he put a lot of effort into the whole

1153.65 --> 1157.25
thing he didn't just come up with this

1156.679 --> 1160.789
[ __ ]

1157.25 --> 1163.159
like two days before that okay the

1160.789 --> 1167.86
that's not what happened he planned this

1163.159 --> 1171.3500000000001
out and when you do that you do some

1167.86 --> 1174.549
training only makes sense that he did

1171.35 --> 1178.1
that doesn't have to be super hardcore

1174.549 --> 1182.6
like every day for a year training that

1178.1 --> 1186.039
[ __ ] or anything but at least some like

1182.6 --> 1189.039
he's not gonna improvise

1186.039 --> 1189.039
completely

1191.51 --> 1194.51
yes

1204.25 --> 1213.1
Yeah right indeed and quite a few I

1210.73 --> 1216.429
think that pretty much all the people

1213.1 --> 1218.32
there were innocent but I don't think

1216.429 --> 1221.25
there's any sign that they weren't

1218.32 --> 1225.27
innocent oh hello Rhys

1221.25 --> 1225.27
yeah I'll give you the link

1289.57 --> 1295.6789999999999
well gee let's not get too graphic

1293.35 --> 1295.6789999999999
please

1295.69 --> 1306.5
but yeah from what I gather you yeah you

1301.37 --> 1309.559
think it's it's real and look for now

1306.5 --> 1311.86
till I've seen in myself which I don't

1309.559 --> 1316.34
look forward to I will go with that and

1311.86 --> 1326.3899999999999
say yeah it's most likely to be very

1316.34 --> 1328.85
real not gonna be not gonna go

1326.39 --> 1333.74
oppositional defiance disorder on this

1328.85 --> 1336.6789999999999
one definitely not like I said yesterday

1333.74 --> 1340.7
and the day before whether it was real

1336.679 --> 1343.72
or not the impact is real and it's

1340.7 --> 1343.72
terrible so

1365.15 --> 1375.14
hey they don't know I'm doing okay the

1371.42 --> 1381.41
good weather is kind of helping but yeah

1375.14 --> 1390.7700000000002
I couldn't get myself to watch it you

1381.41 --> 1393.8300000000002
know oh yeah okay well um yeah I know

1390.77 --> 1396.79
there's a lot of questions going around

1393.83 --> 1402.97
about it's you know it's validity and

1396.79 --> 1408.44
and all the rest of it but here's some

1402.97 --> 1411.38
information there was a total of four

1408.44 --> 1413.21
people arrested you know you might know

1411.38 --> 1417.14
this one of them was trying to help

1413.21 --> 1418.809
police he was he was in army gear

1417.14 --> 1420.26
carrying a shotgun and the police

1418.809 --> 1424.37
arrested him

1420.26 --> 1426.26
there was a woman involved still I don't

1424.37 --> 1428.4499999999998
really know why and there's a young man

1426.26 --> 1433.16
18 years old who was kind of like a

1428.45 --> 1435.04
supporter of this person maybe like new

1433.16 --> 1438.17
mom Facebook or something like that so

1435.04 --> 1439.82
he possibly he might have known what was

1438.17 --> 1443.3600000000001
about to take place and didn't warn

1439.82 --> 1448.8799999999999
anybody so he goes to court tomorrow the

1443.36 --> 1451.58
one shooter did bonus attacks and he was

1448.88 --> 1455.0900000000001
the only actor you know basically yeah

1451.58 --> 1457.22
right okay he shot he shot the 41 people

1455.09 --> 1459.7099999999998
at the Al Noor mosque and then he went

1457.22 --> 1466.55
to the Lynwood EV mosque where he was

1459.71 --> 1468.2
and he killed I think you know this 50

1466.55 --> 1474.5
dead now in total because they didn't

1468.2 --> 1478.3700000000001
survive in hospital so nine nine were

1474.5 --> 1481.63
killed at the limo death mask but here's

1478.37 --> 1486.1699999999998
the here's the thing now the validity

1481.63 --> 1489.41
my mother has a manager called

1486.17 --> 1491.54
I went to his naming sheet but the mail

1489.41 --> 1494.18
you know manager of one of the stores

1491.54 --> 1495.98
his friend wasn't a person in there

1494.18 --> 1501.16
moskals' he's been shot in the hand and

1495.98 --> 1504.08
the lake and recovering another another

1501.16 --> 1506.17
another person one of the youngest

1504.08 --> 1510.9499999999998
members of the staff five doors down

1506.17 --> 1514.3700000000001
from the Linwood mask this is the office

1510.95 --> 1515.8700000000001
as is the shop basically she was stuck

1514.37 --> 1519.6499999999999
in traffic when the city was locked down

1515.87 --> 1522.2299999999998
she got doors windows bang gone by a

1519.65 --> 1525.2
Muslim who's been bullet at Grace back

1522.23 --> 1530.15
of his head and she took him to the

1525.2 --> 1532.22
hospital so now you know I have two

1530.15 --> 1536.45
lines of Investigation I have two things

1532.22 --> 1539.53
that are right close to my family so now

1536.45 --> 1541.97
you've got to add me in there as a liar

1539.53 --> 1544.49
untrustable in all the rest of it if you

1541.97 --> 1546.64
want no no no no if you want to call

1544.49 --> 1546.64
this

1547.69 --> 1553.46
this is important though what you what

1550.94 --> 1556.19
you shared and that's all people

1553.46 --> 1558.17
actually meeting the victims in the

1556.19 --> 1560.75
scenario with the wounds they said

1558.17 --> 1561.17
that's that doesn't happen when it's

1560.75 --> 1563.92
fake

1561.17 --> 1568.27
yeah nobody gets what I'm saying the

1563.92 --> 1572.68
coroner and the hospital so yeah people

1568.27 --> 1576.65
bumped into victims that's a very

1572.68 --> 1579.23
telltale sign is real so sorry Byzantine

1576.65 --> 1582.95
you know this this the young you know

1579.23 --> 1586.54
this young woman she's I think she's

1582.95 --> 1590.42
only like 19 or something um she she

1586.54 --> 1592.1
were you know at the shop just say

1590.42 --> 1595.7
jewelry you know because that's that's

1592.1 --> 1597.35
the industry and so she was you know

1595.7 --> 1599.0900000000001
very distraught and she she saw my

1597.35 --> 1603.08
mother today before my mother flew to

1599.09 --> 1605.99
Oakland and she was crying you know and

1603.08 --> 1607.76
you burst into tears you know and she

1605.99 --> 1610.8700000000001
said I can't understand how anybody can

1607.76 --> 1613.34
do this my mother didn't it you know

1610.87 --> 1615.62
well you know

1613.34 --> 1617.509
it's good you should be proud of

1615.62 --> 1621.649
yourself that you can't come to play any

1617.509 --> 1626.509
any any angle of this you know that can

1621.649 --> 1628.4599999999998
be you know fathomable as no or like you

1626.509 --> 1630.769
know like any in agreeable where you can

1628.46 --> 1639.019
agree or the person had his beliefs and

1630.769 --> 1640.999
all the rest of it but you know I think

1639.019 --> 1645.71
it I think it just got a bit more real

1640.999 --> 1648.169
for me you know because this is now I've

1645.71 --> 1651.769
met the manager the one who had his

1648.169 --> 1655.22
friend you know shot in the hand and in

1651.769 --> 1659.269
the league so when I moved to

1655.22 --> 1661.8500000000001
Christchurch I you know I I could

1659.269 --> 1664.94
potentially meet that person and then

1661.85 --> 1669.049
talk to them right you know in another

1664.94 --> 1672.0800000000002
person you know the staff you know was

1669.049 --> 1674.899
was you know has taken another one

1672.08 --> 1677.72
another one of the injured to to the

1674.899 --> 1679.7299999999998
hospital and so there's two separate

1677.72 --> 1684.049
accounts of to real people growing a

1679.73 --> 1687.83
hospital connected to the staff and my

1684.049 --> 1690.86
mother's a manager of managers know in a

1687.83 --> 1693.019
small town with all the shops you know

1690.86 --> 1695.059
this this was the thing I was wondering

1693.019 --> 1697.6
whether it would happen and in only two

1695.059 --> 1700.639
days and there's no now two connections

1697.6 --> 1706.039
you know the whole the whole city of

1700.639 --> 1708.049
Christchurch is you know shaking you

1706.039 --> 1709.73
know you know people talk about not

1708.049 --> 1712.48
feeling safe but my mother says walking

1709.73 --> 1714.679
around Christchurch's people are like

1712.48 --> 1716.6
absolute strangers are just turning to

1714.679 --> 1717.44
each other and almost looking at each

1716.6 --> 1719.6589999999999
other like you okay

1717.44 --> 1721.46
how you doing you know don't worry we're

1719.659 --> 1721.909
together you know that's good that's

1721.46 --> 1726.3790000000001
good

1721.909 --> 1728.45
yeah but and as far as punishment goes

1726.379 --> 1731.539
remember I was brother please you know

1728.45 --> 1736.6390000000001
it's very emotional you know very very

1731.539 --> 1739.73
hurt by this but there is a you familiar

1736.639 --> 1742.25
with the haka you know the war dance

1739.73 --> 1750.289
that we do the beginning of our rugby

1742.25 --> 1754.21
games don't know never today no it's

1750.289 --> 1758.029
it's it's it's a war dance that we do

1754.21 --> 1761.48
it's before you before we play any rugby

1758.029 --> 1763.58
game we do the haka I got and can I

1761.48 --> 1765.32
probably get the words wrong is this

1763.58 --> 1768.32
heaven that's it it for a long time but

1765.32 --> 1770.299
that's off like the late the leader will

1768.32 --> 1774.25
say ringer ring up [ __ ] huh

1770.299 --> 1778.34
why why takehito didn't it it down there

1774.25 --> 1781.09
and then it says you know it's all about

1778.34 --> 1786.83
rising up and destroying your enemy this

1781.09 --> 1798.1689999999999
gamma tacoma take over gamma tacoma tech

1786.83 --> 1805.75
or coordinated per capita Obama coupon

1798.169 --> 1811.69
day open it open it be Tutera be wow and

1805.75 --> 1813.919
that sounds really alien to me I

1811.69 --> 1815.99
probably got a little bit of they messed

1813.919 --> 1818.8400000000001
up but that's the gist of it but anyway

1815.99 --> 1822.5
that was done today by a gang in New

1818.84 --> 1824.9599999999998
Zealand who came out in in mess and they

1822.5 --> 1828.019
did that outside the mosque and they

1824.96 --> 1831.32
said to the reporters we have friends

1828.019 --> 1834.169
inside too and so basically this guy's a

1831.32 --> 1837.1689999999999
marked man like I told you he's he's got

1834.169 --> 1842.929
badness coming for him he's got some

1837.169 --> 1844.0700000000002
serious repercussions and so you know

1842.929 --> 1846.74
they're talking about putting this guy

1844.07 --> 1848.96
in solitary confinement another side of

1846.74 --> 1851.69
the coin is that we don't have the death

1848.96 --> 1853.789
penalty here but there are many many

1851.69 --> 1855.3200000000002
people calling for the death penalty for

1853.789 --> 1858.0
this person

1855.32 --> 1861.87
they're trying to sign petitions and get

1858.0 --> 1863.79
it get it changed in our country so you

1861.87 --> 1866.82
know those are the updates that I just

1863.79 --> 1871.47
wanted to share with you and just kind

1866.82 --> 1876.87
of brings home just how real this is

1871.47 --> 1881.07
you know so what I wanted to say well so

1876.87 --> 1883.1699999999998
thanks for the update yeah no worries

1881.07 --> 1885.87
for a while four extremities like this

1883.17 --> 1890.79
yeah there should maybe be a death

1885.87 --> 1893.1299999999999
penalty yeah let's hope never have an

1890.79 --> 1894.77
ending that nothing ever like that

1893.13 --> 1897.8400000000001
happens again

1894.77 --> 1899.37
mm-hmm but just a prolonged espinal tea

1897.84 --> 1901.9499999999998
like given the death penalty but not

1899.37 --> 1902.4899999999998
after only after he's been beaten for

1901.95 --> 1905.13
ten years

1902.49 --> 1906.8700000000001
no oh [ __ ] in all manner you know I mean

1905.13 --> 1908.2800000000002
that's that's what I'm calling well the

1906.87 --> 1911.1599999999999
given the death penalty but don't let

1908.28 --> 1913.46
him off so he you know he's got a warm

1911.16 --> 1918.15
place in hell waiting for him already

1913.46 --> 1920.79
definitely yeah he literally asked for

1918.15 --> 1924.3000000000002
it by being completely relentless and

1920.79 --> 1926.37
merciless and and repenting so yeah he's

1924.3 --> 1931.53
gonna get it one way or the other you

1926.37 --> 1936.8999999999999
know yeah I have I have a beautiful long

1931.53 --> 1941.43
message written by one of the Muslims in

1936.9 --> 1945.3600000000001
Christchurch I I think it's a bit long

1941.43 --> 1947.22
to to read you know but okay I want to

1945.36 --> 1949.74
send it I want you know I don't want to

1947.22 --> 1951.78
take every show I just want to I just

1949.74 --> 1953.76
want to I'll send it to you in Skype I I

1951.78 --> 1954.27
think you should read it it's very

1953.76 --> 1958.82
beautiful

1954.27 --> 1961.35
all right thank you all right

1958.82 --> 1963.81
all right guys are you gonna go

1961.35 --> 1967.62
thanks for listening yeah all right

1963.81 --> 1969.51
thanks for thanks for the update thanks

1967.62 --> 1974.06
for listening everyone yeah good idea

1969.51 --> 1974.06
thank you tonight YouTube

1979.2 --> 1981.799
yeah

1983.3 --> 1985.81
yep

1997.21 --> 2009.28
does me some good to hear at least that

2001.98 --> 2013.68
that people are being careful with one

2009.28 --> 2017.58
another they're that they're caring for

2013.68 --> 2021.52
for their town for their city naturally

2017.58 --> 2025.0
being social being helpful to one

2021.52 --> 2026.59
another to help each other out in the

2025.0 --> 2030.82
shock of it all I think that's a good

2026.59 --> 2035.62
thing it's a sign that that yeah the

2030.82 --> 2040.9299999999998
Spirit has not been muted it's a sign of

2035.62 --> 2043.9799999999998
recovery actually it's good it's still

2040.93 --> 2043.98
very fresh

2056.24 --> 2067.29
so yeah let's try to get on to another

2059.28 --> 2069.1490000000003
subject if we can this is very hard to

2067.29 --> 2072.83
get away from these kinds of subjects

2069.149 --> 2072.83
when you get into it

2075.78 --> 2084.77
because everything else just seems to

2079.159 --> 2084.77
dim down in comparison

2084.859 --> 2088.669
even though there probably are there

2086.989 --> 2093.229
were these subjects to talk about as

2088.669 --> 2098.529
well but yeah I'd have to dig for that

2093.229 --> 2098.529
one so let's see

2105.99 --> 2109.31
what's going on

2115.28 --> 2125.5600000000004
at least yeah Infowars is covering it

2121.0 --> 2125.56
properly in my personal opinion

2127.48 --> 2132.62
yeah the typical responses are happening

2130.58 --> 2135.16
but yeah everything they're saying about

2132.62 --> 2138.02
it I pretty much agree with

2135.16 --> 2140.45
confrontation with yeah the crackdown on

2138.02 --> 2142.7599999999998
the gun laws happening right after of

2140.45 --> 2146.48
course was the first thing I expected

2142.76 --> 2151.09
and yeah others are saying like yeah

2146.48 --> 2153.65
it's a leftist leftist trying to frame

2151.09 --> 2157.76
conservatives that is also very

2153.65 --> 2160.04
obviously true it's so many things in

2157.76 --> 2164.5
that sense and everybody is recognizing

2160.04 --> 2168.1
it so that's at least one good thing

2164.5 --> 2174.49
comes from it like the the spell a

2168.1 --> 2178.1
warlocks spell of division in and war is

2174.49 --> 2182.47
yeah of course it's it's being used by

2178.1 --> 2186.14
the insane left media the out of control

2182.47 --> 2188.39
media the mainstream and but the

2186.14 --> 2192.46
alternative is figuring it out very well

2188.39 --> 2192.46
and responding properly

2193.89 --> 2198.68
also you have see you know Russia today

2198.86 --> 2208.44
that was weird though like parents and I

2206.67 --> 2213.11
don't know and in Russia today this is

2208.44 --> 2216.96
article saying that the Prime Minister

2213.11 --> 2220.7400000000002
received the guy's manifesto before it

2216.96 --> 2227.21
actually happened so he actually sent it

2220.74 --> 2227.2099999999996
and then proceeded doing it it's freaky

2232.61 --> 2236.84
yeah anyway

2250.28 --> 2256.3900000000003
oh yeah and this weird thing it's like

2253.58 --> 2260.15
that's it's so weird how it all Cascades

2256.39 --> 2264.0499999999997
and apparently a Muslim activist went up

2260.15 --> 2268.19
to Hillary Clinton's daughter to name

2264.05 --> 2274.4
again Chelsea and accused her of being

2268.19 --> 2277.91
the cause of it it's like weird

2274.4 --> 2280.94
misplaced maybe not this all depends on

2277.91 --> 2284.81
the angle like politically maybe but

2280.94 --> 2288.2000000000003
directly no and it's just a lot of

2284.81 --> 2291.89
friction happening spawning out of it

2288.2 --> 2297.8799999999997
and it's to be expected but I don't

2291.89 --> 2297.8799999999997
always see the angles of it coming

2299.67 --> 2307.46
yeah friction indeed this

2318.28 --> 2321.0
let's see

2330.789 --> 2339.4590000000003
yeah if anyone else wants to come on the

2334.039 --> 2339.4590000000003
panel by the way be good

2378.03 --> 2381.03
yeah

2381.15 --> 2384.2000000000003
Elizabeth blank

2385.22 --> 2390.29
I could talk about other stuff but I'd

2387.05 --> 2393.4700000000003
have to get into that first and I've

2390.29 --> 2396.73
been getting into gaming which is not a

2393.47 --> 2396.73
very interesting subject

2400.74 --> 2407.0589999999997
a bit about damage so dragons I'm gonna

2404.76 --> 2410.94
do there

2407.059 --> 2413.96
but yeah it's not you know already

2410.94 --> 2413.96
talked about that yesterday

2415.03 --> 2418.21
digging into

2435.96 --> 2441.0
I have to remind myself to actually make

2438.18 --> 2444.33
dinner this evening

2441.0 --> 2449.58
yesterday I skipped it because yeah it

2444.33 --> 2451.5
was too late I was too drunk and didn't

2449.58 --> 2454.17
feel like doing all that so I have to do

2451.5 --> 2456.44
it I'm gonna skip dinner again it's not

2454.17 --> 2456.44
good

2465.46 --> 2474.579
yeah and indeed I drank enough for me

2469.809 --> 2477.6090000000004
for things to start spitting as well but

2474.579 --> 2480.809
still the axis of the spin was me and

2477.609 --> 2480.8089999999997
not the earth

2497.69 --> 2505.8
John boo-boo oh no I don't drink every

2503.25 --> 2510.08
night but I have been drinking more

2505.8 --> 2515.51
regularly also trying to have break days

2510.08 --> 2515.5099999999998
but it's just all this [ __ ] happening

2524.65 --> 2529.36
yeah I don't know if blow Buster's is

2526.69 --> 2535.6
gonna be on tonight ball busters

2529.36 --> 2539.59
definitely will be we'll see yeah I

2535.6 --> 2545.2599999999998
wasn't rolling Bob in Martin Lucas jet

2539.59 --> 2551.4700000000003
yesterday I think Bob is going for a

2545.26 --> 2553.69
complete ignorance policy cuz he just is

2551.47 --> 2558.43
acting like nothing happened

2553.69 --> 2565.7200000000003
so it seems then looked up to close but

2558.43 --> 2568.71
it seems to be his attitude and that's

2565.72 --> 2572.3999999999996
not gonna last very well over time

2568.71 --> 2575.1
because he has to address the situation

2572.4 --> 2580.59
just keeps on going

2575.1 --> 2580.5899999999997
the situation is gonna catch up on him

2612.17 --> 2619.31
hey panels still open for anyone who

2615.78 --> 2619.3100000000004
wants to join except Jose

2637.54 --> 2648.14
explain baba more okay oh there yeah

2643.76 --> 2650.4500000000003
well first off I don't know Bob very

2648.14 --> 2654.74
well okay

2650.45 --> 2657.5899999999997
I have chatted with him I think I was in

2654.74 --> 2660.68
a panel at one point where he was as

2657.59 --> 2663.1400000000003
well and from what I've gathered he

2660.68 --> 2669.3199999999997
liked a lot of other people it's just

2663.14 --> 2672.2599999999998
not very good at discussing things he's

2669.32 --> 2675.05
good at telling stories and sharing his

2672.26 --> 2680.96
angle to things and he doesn't seem to

2675.05 --> 2684.29
be super flexible and that is what is

2680.96 --> 2687.08
causing a lot of trouble because yeah

2684.29 --> 2691.369
that is the primary focus Flat Earth

2687.08 --> 2693.89
debates it's the development the moving

2691.369 --> 2697.4300000000003
on overcoming obstacles working through

2693.89 --> 2700.19
things very as quick as possible and not

2697.43 --> 2703.0099999999998
so much as making an overarching story

2700.19 --> 2707.5
that kind of fits and that is Bob's

2703.01 --> 2713.2700000000004
focus it seems so yeah that just doesn't

2707.5 --> 2716.69
last very well over time and he

2713.27 --> 2719.69
basically needs to move on but he seems

2716.69 --> 2725.07
to just not want it to and he's trying

2719.69 --> 2729.14
to just sit it out wanting it to stop

2725.07 --> 2733.02
the whole criticism from Nathan side and

2729.14 --> 2736.71
yeah other people that have kind of

2733.02 --> 2738.93
close to him probably know that if

2736.71 --> 2745.07
they're gonna bring it up Dan Bob's

2738.93 --> 2749.16
gonna get all pissed off again and act

2745.07 --> 2752.3700000000003
badly and they don't want it

2749.16 --> 2755.91
it's like bob doesn't like to be

2752.37 --> 2763.29
corrected by anyone I'm pretty sure of

2755.91 --> 2768.1499999999996
that and yeah that's that's his problem

2763.29 --> 2772.04
and the problem for those that are with

2768.15 --> 2772.04
him that's it

2778.44 --> 2784.4
I don't know that yeah other than that I

2781.44 --> 2787.619
don't know we know him well enough

2784.4 --> 2790.799
listen to quite a few clove busters

2787.619 --> 2794.94
listen to him talking that's it that's

2790.799 --> 2798.359
all I really have to go on and just pay

2794.94 --> 2801.619
attention to what's going on among the

2798.359 --> 2804.859
circles what people say about them

2801.619 --> 2804.859
that's it

2833.94 --> 2841.06
yeah that does sound a bit weird dances

2837.37 --> 2844.68
with zombies put in lecturing America on

2841.06 --> 2844.68
democracy that is kind of weird

2849.809 --> 2857.619
although yeah I do think that he's doing

2852.94 --> 2864.4
a great job with Russia or whatever

2857.619 --> 2867.569
happened in the past he did take the

2864.4 --> 2870.609
necessary drastic steps to ensure

2867.569 --> 2874.45
national security for real and not

2870.609 --> 2878.319
globalist security and yeah he did all

2874.45 --> 2882.489
that was pretty nasty fundamentally but

2878.319 --> 2888.269
yeah it did yield the result that is now

2882.489 --> 2891.67
still yeah the fruits of those actions

2888.269 --> 2894.9889999999996
in a good way are starting to be reaped

2891.67 --> 2897.5190000000002
so yeah Russia is doing pretty damn well

2894.989 --> 2901.329
compared to many other countries because

2897.519 --> 2907.5089999999996
they did take the necessary measures as

2901.329 --> 2911.94
well from a national perspective but

2907.509 --> 2911.94
yeah to then start lecturing America is

2912.45 --> 2920.1899999999996
it's almost like yeah America's

2916.9 --> 2924.009
obviously in governmental crisis

2920.19 --> 2926.23
government yeah there's like it's not a

2924.009 --> 2930.039
civil war it's more like a governmental

2926.23 --> 2932.829
war government is warring among one

2930.039 --> 2938.789
another and to then say oh you're doing

2932.829 --> 2938.789
it wrong it's like yeah duh but

2939.299 --> 2946.279
for somebody like Putin to do that is

2942.989 --> 2946.279
kind of bit off

2952.78 --> 2956.4
but guy does it anyway

2964.88 --> 2973.9700000000003
oh it it wasn't real it was a freaking

2968.509 --> 2976.339
joke thanks thanks thanks for that look

2973.97 --> 2980.18
I don't give a [ __ ] about bill mirrors

2976.339 --> 2983.42
jokes or any of these stupid left-wing

2980.18 --> 2986.569
comedy show programs because they put

2983.42 --> 2991.369
out miss info [ __ ] and I just

2986.569 --> 2994.43
thought you were being literal okay so

2991.369 --> 3001.17
apparently it's not thanks thanks for

2994.43 --> 3004.47
making me say all that please don't

3001.17 --> 3004.4700000000003
don't do that

3007.46 --> 3012.04
oh all right

3026.64 --> 3032.5499999999997
oh wait that

3029.34 --> 3034.7400000000002
the parenting notes from Billy Ray Cyrus

3032.55 --> 3035.2200000000003
whoever that may be I have no idea where

3034.74 --> 3037.3199999999997
that is

3035.22 --> 3039.3599999999997
so that was apparently the joke okay

3037.32 --> 3041.54
fine I don't care I don't even know the

3039.36 --> 3041.54
person

3059.529 --> 3066.97
well I wouldn't call Putin a sicko

3062.809 --> 3066.9700000000003
so that's just just wrong

3100.35 --> 3109.77
oh right well it's not my iPhone right

3105.72 --> 3114.29
and I have no confirmation that that was

3109.77 --> 3114.29
physically literally real at the time

3115.13 --> 3123.1800000000003
and it's not birth Darkseid it's the

3118.95 --> 3129.24
dark world it's extra dimensional I

3123.18 --> 3132.45
think that's where I saw that phone full

3129.24 --> 3139.4599999999996
screen phone touch screen with YouTube

3132.45 --> 3143.24
videos yeah and that's not 93 by the way

3139.46 --> 3143.2400000000002
that was 97

3147.23 --> 3157.97
right it was like a dream but not really

3153.079 --> 3164.8590000000004
it's not just a dream it's it's like a

3157.97 --> 3164.859
lucid dream that you can't get out of

3174.599 --> 3181.839
also that is so real that it's very hard

3178.9 --> 3186.549
to tell if it's physically real or not

3181.839 --> 3189.849
oh right

3186.549 --> 3191.619
ape psychosis yeah well sure that is a

3189.849 --> 3193.059
psychosis because that happens to

3191.619 --> 3195.069
everyone everyone when they get a

3193.059 --> 3197.5890000000004
psychosis they get trapped into another

3195.069 --> 3208.2889999999998
dimension and mistake it for real that's

3197.589 --> 3216.689
the bright right now actual psychosis is

3208.289 --> 3223.5690000000004
noted by irrational thinking structure

3216.689 --> 3225.609
that is psychosis by figuring out yeah

3223.569 --> 3229.839
in the process of trying to understand

3225.609 --> 3231.159
something adapt to reasoning that

3229.839 --> 3236.13
doesn't make sense

3231.159 --> 3240.5190000000002
that is psychosis so deregulated

3236.13 --> 3244.529
deregulation of your common sense that's

3240.519 --> 3249.549
what most psychosis tends to be okay

3244.529 --> 3253.449
it's not a vision experience to have

3249.549 --> 3258.13
psychosis although hey there may be side

3253.449 --> 3261.7290000000003
effects there may be like psychosis may

3258.13 --> 3264.699
be like type of condition that will

3261.729 --> 3269.169
allow this kind of extra dimensional

3264.699 --> 3272.079
contact I don't know I never studied it

3269.169 --> 3277.049
I just went through that [ __ ] at the

3272.079 --> 3277.049
time so yeah

3285.14 --> 3294.79
have I been Mandela affected what do you

3292.22 --> 3294.79
mean with that

3297.64 --> 3303.89
look technically if somebody has been

3301.37 --> 3305.81
affected by Mandela they'll never know

3303.89 --> 3309.0499999999997
because everything seems perfectly

3305.81 --> 3312.32
normal to them they remember the things

3309.05 --> 3314.51
how they are when you're not affected by

3312.32 --> 3316.6400000000003
it that's when you start to remember

3314.51 --> 3324.0200000000004
things that apparently no longer are

3316.64 --> 3325.91
like you remember them and everything

3324.02 --> 3329.15
that pretty much came out about the

3325.91 --> 3332.21
Mandela fact that never really caught my

3329.15 --> 3336.26
attention I never thought about those

3332.21 --> 3338.05
the details before that only thing that

3336.26 --> 3342.8900000000003
really did stand out to me personally

3338.05 --> 3348.38
was c-3po slag that felt really off to

3342.89 --> 3355.85
me but yeah other than that not a lot of

3348.38 --> 3361.42
things but yeah even like in 2005 I did

3355.85 --> 3361.42
hear about the Mandela effect somehow

3362.22 --> 3367.2
never really impressed me a lot but

3370.97 --> 3379.7599999999998
from within the dark world experiences

3375.25 --> 3382.06
it did turn out to be something in some

3379.76 --> 3382.0600000000004
way

3397.43 --> 3411.24
- okay insanity is sanity have you are

3405.66 --> 3414.12
you trying to like fish evidence that

3411.24 --> 3418.7999999999997
Arwen is actually crazy is that what

3414.12 --> 3424.38
you're trying to do right what have you

3418.8 --> 3427.5
ever done that's do you know about any

3424.38 --> 3429.57
of this [ __ ] you've done some crazy

3427.5 --> 3435.18
stuff in your life you think that's

3429.57 --> 3440.31
appropriate question to ask people right

3435.18 --> 3444.54
and by the way I haven't dressed up as a

3440.31 --> 3445.44
woman at least I did that like when I

3444.54 --> 3449.67
was seven

3445.44 --> 3451.68
once I think I already said that on my

3449.67 --> 3455.4900000000002
own volition by the way it was my idea

3451.68 --> 3457.77
as a kid to do that didn't have no crazy

3455.49 --> 3463.89
social justice worry to tell me to do

3457.77 --> 3467.25
that because they didn't exist as for

3463.89 --> 3471.2
makeup yeah sure I've been in the Gulf

3467.25 --> 3471.2
see knife I've dealt with makeup

3474.28 --> 3477.28
so

3478.35 --> 3484.7799999999997
but yeah I'd never used makeup to try to

3482.56 --> 3486.12
make myself look female or anything

3484.78 --> 3488.2900000000004
absolutely not

3486.12 --> 3491.17
but there's all kinds of things you can

3488.29 --> 3495.99
do with makeup and emphasize certain

3491.17 --> 3502.78
elements get a certain style look - you

3495.99 --> 3504.91
can have decorations like decoration

3502.78 --> 3507.57
patterns is so many things you could do

3504.91 --> 3511.5099999999998
especially in the goth scene like yeah

3507.57 --> 3514.75
it's not uncommon for men to do that

3511.51 --> 3515.65
kind of thing experiment with makeup one

3514.75 --> 3518.23
way or the other

3515.65 --> 3524.2000000000003
though some just completely don't do it

3518.23 --> 3526.57
I wasn't too fanatical about it because

3524.2 --> 3530.23
I learned pretty early on that makeup

3526.57 --> 3536.11
can have negative side effects because

3530.23 --> 3538.09
it's not yeah it tends to be toxic not

3536.11 --> 3541.06
good for your skin also have hormonal

3538.09 --> 3547.86
influences that kind of thing so I've

3541.06 --> 3551.08
always been very Sameer and careful and

3547.86 --> 3553.29
haven't done up any makeup in golf scene

3551.08 --> 3555.71
in a long time

3553.29 --> 3559.16
the last time

3555.71 --> 3563.03
I did that kind of thing was with my ex

3559.16 --> 3567.95
but yeah she goes dress up then I go

3563.03 --> 3570.5800000000004
dress up you have to stay on par or it's

3567.95 --> 3570.58
gonna look off

3571.31 --> 3574.43
you know

3586.7 --> 3594.16
Oh God braces ah more Mandela effects

3615.3 --> 3623.0800000000004
well personally I had some yeah at the

3620.11 --> 3627.03
in the dark world time I had some really

3623.08 --> 3630.04
weird confrontation with Vendela effect

3627.03 --> 3634.44
relating to the Bible and I don't know

3630.04 --> 3639.4
how to interpret what I experienced then

3634.44 --> 3643.3
but it was suggested to me that details

3639.4 --> 3650.38
were being changed and at the time I was

3643.3 --> 3652.27
not yeah I was still very atheist did in

3650.38 --> 3655.51
the face where I just didn't trust the

3652.27 --> 3658.45
Bible at all so I just thought like okay

3655.51 --> 3667.0600000000004
that's kind of weird how is that even

3658.45 --> 3670.6
possible huh because yeah it was in the

3667.06 --> 3673.63
dark world very blatantly so as there

3670.6 --> 3677.77
were some entities that I pretty much

3673.63 --> 3681.07
know are not physically around probably

3677.77 --> 3686.16
haven't been for a long time same

3681.07 --> 3686.1600000000003
characters same type of atmosphere and

3686.73 --> 3693.28
yeah then you don't really know if it is

3689.88 --> 3695.56
literal if that is actually a physical

3693.28 --> 3699.61
thing that's happening you don't know

3695.56 --> 3702.79
for sure I didn't know for sure so I

3699.61 --> 3704.98
don't know what transpired when that

3702.79 --> 3709.81
happened did I just witness something

3704.98 --> 3713.65
like basically in the spiritual realm

3709.81 --> 3715.15
poking my nose into something that was

3713.65 --> 3718.63
happening

3715.15 --> 3725.28
it manifesting in some more physical

3718.63 --> 3729.0
relatable way to me I don't know that's

3725.28 --> 3729.0
very hard to tell

3758.0 --> 3764.04
all right yeah

3759.96 --> 3769.77
clear flutter it yeah searching for a

3764.04 --> 3772.32
flat earth by a default search on Google

3769.77 --> 3774.18
especially if you're not a standard flat

3772.32 --> 3777.6800000000003
earther yeah it's gonna yield a lot of

3774.18 --> 3780.39
crap because there is a lot of crap and

3777.68 --> 3783.69
Google doesn't want you to get to the

3780.39 --> 3785.31
good stuff you're gonna really have to

3783.69 --> 3792.15
look you're gonna have to look for the

3785.31 --> 3795.33
right people you can let Google do the

3792.15 --> 3797.55
search the the journey for you you have

3795.33 --> 3799.65
to do it yourself that's just how it

3797.55 --> 3802.29
works now and yeah there's so much crap

3799.65 --> 3806.28
and it gets all the attention and that

3802.29 --> 3810.24
actually functions for more fake or

3806.28 --> 3811.71
stupid flat earthers to make more crap

3810.24 --> 3817.9399999999996
because they're getting attention

3811.71 --> 3821.18
so yeah it's we're being spammed

3817.94 --> 3823.89
basically that was always gonna happen I

3821.18 --> 3827.1299999999997
was always gonna happen we talked about

3823.89 --> 3829.97
it even two three years ago like yeah

3827.13 --> 3829.9700000000003
it's still small

3830.68 --> 3837.64
and you're gonna bump into people pretty

3833.95 --> 3840.64
quickly and nobody's really touching it

3837.64 --> 3841.48
for commercial reasons but that's

3840.64 --> 3843.43
changed

3841.48 --> 3849.19
that's absolutely changed now and

3843.43 --> 3852.37
there's just a lot of people that just

3849.19 --> 3855.85
choose flatters do something with

3852.37 --> 3859.08
flatters purely for the options like oh

3855.85 --> 3862.63
it's a new field like exploration it's

3859.08 --> 3865.5099999999998
something that a field that can be

3862.63 --> 3868.03
latched onto and Exploited with the

3865.51 --> 3872.23
community surrounding it and the newly

3868.03 --> 3875.23
opening interest so people will do just

3872.23 --> 3878.26
crappy stuff with it right now because

3875.23 --> 3880.78
it gets a lot of attention so yeah

3878.26 --> 3884.4100000000003
there's a big row of attention-grabbing

3880.78 --> 3889.03
idiots and commercial exploiters that

3884.41 --> 3891.37
will now be like a wall in between real

3889.03 --> 3895.42
Flat Earth researchers that have been at

3891.37 --> 3898.15
it for a long time and and the outside

3895.42 --> 3901.06
audience that is getting hints dropped

3898.15 --> 3903.4300000000003
about Flat Earth here and there and yeah

3901.06 --> 3906.1
they will have to get through that wall

3903.43 --> 3907.93
of idiots if they really want to know

3906.1 --> 3909.97
but that's the trick isn't it do they

3907.93 --> 3913.5099999999998
really want to know or are they gonna

3909.97 --> 3918.0
let the the eat the wall of idiots repel

3913.51 --> 3918.0
them to stop researching it

3946.15 --> 3949.799
so any more questions

3967.33 --> 3977.13
right yeah John whoa no yeah YouTube

3971.92 --> 3977.13
does sometimes screw around lockup

3978.54 --> 3986.59
it does actually do that at times but it

3981.67 --> 3990.16
I think it's specifically to strangle a

3986.59 --> 3993.94
momentum and they've been known to do

3990.16 --> 3996.67
that like that [ __ ] even happened to

3993.94 --> 3998.92
Alex Jones when he was still allowed on

3996.67 --> 3999.31
YouTube they did that kind of [ __ ] to

3998.92 --> 4001.65
him

3999.31 --> 4004.98
to basically strangle the moment and

4001.65 --> 4007.86
make sure it doesn't get yeah a giant

4004.98 --> 4012.93
growth spurt and grab all the attention

4007.86 --> 4015.7200000000003
that's why YouTube does that it's very

4012.93 --> 4021.8999999999996
and nasty it's social engineering it's

4015.72 --> 4023.8199999999997
evil and yet it sometimes happens

4021.9 --> 4027.09
completely unexpected I think it's

4023.82 --> 4034.9700000000003
probably mostly algorithm induced auto

4027.09 --> 4039.27
measures not done manually by anyone and

4034.97 --> 4043.77
they just choke the stream when things

4039.27 --> 4047.79
get too real or too interesting in the

4043.77 --> 4050.85
in the right moment to prevent basically

4047.79 --> 4052.29
a big crowd from funneling in it

4050.85 --> 4054.5099999999998
happened to some of Owen Benjamin

4052.29 --> 4057.54
streams as well when he got really

4054.51 --> 4062.19
radical really on target that suddenly

4057.54 --> 4065.16
the streams diluting it ruining yeah

4062.19 --> 4068.85
typically happens when when things heat

4065.16 --> 4070.83
up really heavy during a live stream

4068.85 --> 4072.98
that's when suddenly it starts to cut

4070.83 --> 4072.98
out

4079.359 --> 4084.2799999999997
or maybe YouTube just doesn't like you I

4084.76 --> 4094.7200000000003
don't know if it's let's see now my

4090.829 --> 4098.049
stream seems to be just running normally

4094.72 --> 4098.049
no legs

4114.14 --> 4117.38
Jeffrey bill

4136.679 --> 4143.529
yeah Jeffrey bill just look I'm almost

4141.639 --> 4145.2390000000005
rounding out the show not bringing that

4143.529 --> 4147.31
up again I just got away from that

4145.239 --> 4151.239
subject thank you very much I didn't

4147.31 --> 4155.9490000000005
watch it but Reese had more data or

4151.239 --> 4161.04
insider data of people witnesses people

4155.949 --> 4164.888999999999
that knew victims all that stuff so

4161.04 --> 4168.069
despite not having seen it I'm pretty

4164.889 --> 4175.900000000001
pretty much convinced that it has to be

4168.069 --> 4177.6990000000005
real but yeah that's that's just what I

4175.9 --> 4180.159
can gather from everything that's being

4177.699 --> 4184.2699999999995
put out about it and their responses

4180.159 --> 4189.69
from people so that's it that's all I'm

4184.27 --> 4189.6900000000005
gonna say about it for now

4195.23 --> 4204.11
Jimbo Joe bode Joe

4198.949 --> 4206.669999999999
that's hilarious I think NASA is lying I

4204.11 --> 4212.808999999999
think the first person on Mars is going

4206.67 --> 4212.809
to be a [ __ ] you know it

4221.39 --> 4226.59
although yeah of course nobody is

4224.88 --> 4230.79
actually going to be of Mars because

4226.59 --> 4234.09
it's not a location that is not on this

4230.79 --> 4237.47
world when you see it unless they do a

4234.09 --> 4237.47
pure virtual thing

4294.07 --> 4298.0
guys are getting weird

4366.62 --> 4373.73
that's terrible joke every bill that's

4371.04 --> 4373.73
just terrible

4401.249 --> 4407.199
okay well this is not really going

4404.469 --> 4409.9890000000005
anywhere I think I'm gonna round out the

4407.199 --> 4413.65
show could have gone on a little longer

4409.989 --> 4416.499
but yeah it's only reasoning very

4413.65 --> 4419.228999999999
shortly yes

4416.499 --> 4421.36
I'm not gonna continue talking for

4419.229 --> 4426.159000000001
another hour just by myself especially

4421.36 --> 4429.13
