yesterday but yeah it's just full-on

77.54 --> 91.24000000000001
clouds not windy hasn't been a lot of

82.91 --> 91.24
rain so far but that'll probably come

91.6 --> 102.02
yeah got the door closed for now so

96.229 --> 104.56
today I only have two you with me ran

102.02 --> 104.56
out of coffee

105.35 --> 116.479
and yeah I currently can't really use

108.74 --> 120.02
any more coffee because I got a

116.479 --> 121.899
situation to look forward to and well

120.02 --> 127.49
not really

121.899 --> 131.39
Thursday so Thursday there's not gonna

127.49 --> 133.67
be an early bird show because I'm

131.39 --> 140.569
basically being forced to get up really

133.67 --> 143.82999999999998
early and then proceed throw quantities

140.569 --> 143.82999999999998
of my stuff away

144.51 --> 148.54
so yeah and there's nothing really I can

147.64 --> 153.51999999999998
do about it

148.54 --> 157.29999999999998
it's all too short notice so yeah that's

153.52 --> 161.38000000000002
one of those things that I really don't

157.3 --> 163.21
like to do but I've been sort of

161.38 --> 165.54999999999998
preparing for it since my dad also

163.21 --> 168.19
dumped that information on me right

165.55 --> 170.88000000000002
before the conference we just added more

168.19 --> 174.57999999999998
to the pilot back at a time

170.88 --> 187.06
that's at least had over a week mentally

174.58 --> 190.27
to prepare for that to come all right so

187.06 --> 193.9
oh yeah by the way also very late

190.27 --> 202.45000000000002
yesterday it was half past 10:00

193.9 --> 205.08
crazy time I got a package you see from

202.45 --> 205.07999999999998
Amazon

208.42 --> 211.53
[Music]

237.88 --> 247.73
probably a lot more efficient way to do

240.2 --> 253.06
this all right okay a heart packaged an

247.73 --> 258.59
LTE Bible thank you MC Tunes for that

253.06 --> 265.75
got here really quick e nice okay good

258.59 --> 265.75
it's leather cover it like that and gold

265.93 --> 272.68
on the side that's I like that it's a

270.2 --> 272.68
nice touch

277.52 --> 287.84
[Music]

280.539 --> 292.34
it's really really thin paper now the

287.84 --> 306.229
font is definitely doable doesn't seem

292.34 --> 312.88899999999995
too small yeah okay interesting there's

306.229 --> 319.13
also a map in here fancy mm-hmm yeah so

312.889 --> 323.05
I got a Bible now to be fair I don't

319.13 --> 325.55
know what took so long but I have it and

323.05 --> 337.069
that doesn't mean that I'm blaming MC

325.55 --> 345.46000000000004
Tunes more like in general just has red

337.069 --> 345.46000000000004
letters does it don't think so

349.96 --> 352.96
see

356.06 --> 361.09
with the blue gold yeah

362.71 --> 371.18
anyway the heart cover is kind of an a

365.39 --> 373.58
nice extra touch it's a good way to

371.18 --> 382.34000000000003
package it if you want to transport it I

373.58 --> 389.75
like it so oh by the way Thank You

382.34 --> 394.78999999999996

anyway thank you for the support

446.91 --> 449.78000000000003
I don't

453.06 --> 467.52
wait Ronnie fashi are you asking me I'm

465.48 --> 477.86
not exactly you started looking up

467.52 --> 477.85999999999996
things though where should I be looking

481.95 --> 490.62
red letters i well this is an NLT by but

488.76 --> 499.32
I don't know if there is any red letters

490.62 --> 502.26
anywhere I don't think this is like a

499.32 --> 506.13
one of those super detailed Bibles with

502.26 --> 519.18
all the the very complex word technicals

506.13 --> 521.55
in it where well if I'm just scrolling

519.18 --> 527.6999999999999
through it as it were I'm not seeing in

521.55 --> 530.27
any red letters and that would kind of

527.7 --> 530.2700000000001
stand out

536.79 --> 542.0
No zero red letters

547.07 --> 551.33
all right

548.9 --> 554.9499999999999
okay well they're they're apparently are

551.33 --> 559.82
huge amounts of different Bibles Paula

554.95 --> 565.0400000000001
addressed me about that and now this was

559.82 --> 568.4000000000001
just a choice that she thought in her in

565.04 --> 571.37
your expert opinion about Christianity

568.4 --> 573.98
and Bibles she thought this one would

571.37 --> 576.32
probably be the best for me as a newbie

573.98 --> 579.339
because I am a newbie at the actual

576.32 --> 579.339
reading of the Bible

581.71 --> 590.22
[Music]

587.22 --> 590.22

astounding

647.439 --> 659.0999999999999
oh yeah getting a lot of comments BAM

654.97 --> 662.86

Fyodor Dostoevsky Alex and their

light-water yeah good to see you all huh

776.14 --> 791.36
that's usually why I do that at the

778.88 --> 794.15
beginning and not after 50 minutes 12 so

791.36 --> 797.6
yeah let me get my mind back onto things

794.15 --> 799.49
because yeah I'm kind of stuck now on

797.6 --> 804.5500000000001
things that I'm not really looking

799.49 --> 808.4300000000001
forward to but mentally preparing for I

804.55 --> 812.03
also had some red wine yesterday and it

808.43 --> 817.25
was good didn't take too much I think

812.03 --> 819.26
also I had finally properly made big and

817.25 --> 821.66
big meal that I've been postponing for

819.26 --> 825.53
almost a week I just didn't want to do

821.66 --> 830.48
it and I got by with my food not too

825.53 --> 832.9599999999999
expensively so but yeah yesterday I did

830.48 --> 836.95
finally managed to get myself to make it

832.96 --> 836.95
and it was really worth it

840.5 --> 843.96
Yeah right

841.97 --> 848.46
[Music]

843.96 --> 855.5
damn it you know stupid comments to fill

848.46 --> 855.5
out all my I do this

857.82 --> 861.6600000000001
activity my comments

872.209 --> 881.079
hmm now doesn't seem to be a way to

875.869 --> 884.0790000000001
easily turn off comments to videos only

881.079 --> 884.079
unfortunately

890.37 --> 893.37
what

897.62 --> 914.15
uh Jose no need for all of that bring me

906.77 --> 917.05
the well it might be that she's gone to

914.15 --> 917.05
better ooh

918.08 --> 926.7700000000001
well that's decisive right no Jose you

923.15 --> 926.77
were kind of asking for it though

936.16 --> 943.99
don't worry Fyodor Dostoevsky you can

938.769 --> 945.699
time him out after he comes back from

943.99 --> 948.79
because he's probably gonna keep on

945.699 --> 951.88
doing that anyway

948.79 --> 951.88
[Music]

957.66 --> 961.31
a degree Reese

964.71 --> 975.0600000000001
Oh Oh Daniel you're gonna complain about

967.17 --> 977.0999999999999
the moderation again where is Trish well

975.06 --> 979.8599999999999
I don't have Trish blocked anymore

977.1 --> 983.88
as I said I would unblock her just to

979.86 --> 986.49
see what she would be up to so oh wait

983.88 --> 987.77
she might be still blocked in the mud in

986.49 --> 990.86
here I'll check

987.77 --> 990.86
[Music]

994.96 --> 1001.08
now look Daniel usually when I start

998.05 --> 1003.51
timing you out it's not because of the

1001.08 --> 1007.47
questions you're asking it's mostly

1003.51 --> 1010.8
because of the timing and the obvious

1007.47 --> 1013.44
signs that you are just disregarding

1010.8 --> 1016.1899999999999
what's going on and it gets really

1013.44 --> 1016.19
disruptive

1022.18 --> 1025.3899999999999
[Music]

1030.43 --> 1044.73
okay detected well god I'm gonna be

1036.85 --> 1044.73
digging alright

1044.99 --> 1050.79
No

1047.02 --> 1050.79
I did unblock her

1053.61 --> 1059.8999999999999
she shouldn't be blocked in my chat but

1058.23 --> 1062.91
I don't know if she's up

1059.9 --> 1066.96
but yeah I'm pretty sure I even unbox

1062.91 --> 1071.27
her in chat before I and blocked her

1066.96 --> 1071.27
from with Google itself

1078.5 --> 1089.809
oh wait I did so I have a blog okay

1082.46 --> 1122.919
unblocked now all right glad I found

1089.809 --> 1122.9189999999999
that in one go yeah right well Daniel

1123.25 --> 1133.37
you might know about you why was that

1129.13 --> 1136.7
they are almost an aberration in the

1133.37 --> 1139.4799999999998
genetic spectrum of the canine of which

1136.7 --> 1145.22
the wolf is probably the the bass part

1139.48 --> 1147.799
and I'll bet you that Chihuahuas on

1145.22 --> 1152.69
average do tend to have like many

1147.799 --> 1156.309
extreme bred dogs they have procreation

1152.69 --> 1159.0800000000002
problems because they're on the edge of

1156.309 --> 1162.6499999999999
adaptation within their species they're

1159.08 --> 1164.9499999999998
on the edge of what yeah their form can

1162.65 --> 1164.95
take

1166.45 --> 1169.559
[Music]

1173.22 --> 1180.04
[Music]

1177.31 --> 1182.71
yeah I know CGI ranty I've known that

1180.04 --> 1184.72
for a long time as soon as I started to

1182.71 --> 1187.63
basically push her away she immediately

1184.72 --> 1190.39
started literally addressing trolls in

1187.63 --> 1192.93
the Flat Earth debates getting in

1190.39 --> 1198.46
conversations with them and asking them

1192.93 --> 1200.5900000000001
literally there to help her get this

1198.46 --> 1202.27
point across and the trolls just thought

1200.59 --> 1205.57
it was hilarious so they started to

1202.27 --> 1208.9
doing that yeah I know I was there when

1205.57 --> 1211.3899999999999
it happened and it didn't take any time

1208.9 --> 1213.22
or any kind of like obstacle for her to

1211.39 --> 1216.8500000000001
do that she just immediately did that

1213.22 --> 1229.1200000000001
there was a big red light for me anyway

1216.85 --> 1232.6899999999998
hello Karen B Wow she's you got

1229.12 --> 1236.86
something inside there that that causes

1232.69 --> 1242.14
you to act out so much in your allergic

1236.86 --> 1244.4199999999998
response to it's just like just think

1242.14 --> 1245.92
about it like this Jose before you get

1244.42 --> 1250.8700000000001
timeout because I'm sure you will for

1245.92 --> 1253.75
that right what you're doing in the chat

1250.87 --> 1257.8899999999999
right now is among people that have a

1253.75 --> 1262.06
certain level of thinking and doing and

1257.89 --> 1267.22
feeling and to compare it to a situation

1262.06 --> 1269.95
you might get well just think that we

1267.22 --> 1273.76
would be constantly making fun of how

1269.95 --> 1276.13
[ __ ] or stupid your kid would be I

1273.76 --> 1278.77
think you can imagine that would be very

1276.13 --> 1282.19
personal that would hurt but we would

1278.77 --> 1284.26
all just be scuffing at that oh that's

1282.19 --> 1288.01
what it's like what you're doing right

1284.26 --> 1290.32
now you're disrespecting necessarily you

1288.01 --> 1294.39
know we understand you don't believe

1290.32 --> 1299.4399999999998
you're kind of an atheist or whatever

1294.39 --> 1303.8700000000001
but you don't need to throw that out

1299.44 --> 1306.22
here at such a time it's just not social

1303.87 --> 1309.8899999999999
it's not

1306.22 --> 1312.1000000000001
decent to do that you understand how

1309.89 --> 1312.1000000000001
they

1315.21 --> 1321.2
[Music]

1318.56 --> 1323.23
okay clearly that goes too far don't do

1321.2 --> 1326.77
that

1323.23 --> 1326.77
seriously don't do that

1336.299 --> 1339.299
she's

1345.46 --> 1353.95
come on Jose why are you doing this

1349.14 --> 1357.91
you're just just respond to to what I

1353.95 --> 1360.22
said take a step back and let all the

1357.91 --> 1372.97
nerves calm down okay because this is

1360.22 --> 1374.8600000000001
just unnecessary Yeah right sleeping

1372.97 --> 1383.2
worried that's exactly how I feel about

1374.86 --> 1385.09
it yeah somebody can be wrong and

1383.2 --> 1387.52
because of a lot of reasons because it's

1385.09 --> 1390.25
very personal something they're just

1387.52 --> 1394.99
really stubborn or they're contrarian or

1390.25 --> 1397.77
they're just not ready yet that's

1394.99 --> 1399.7
usually what drives a lot of atheists

1397.77 --> 1404.98
especially when they're still in the

1399.7 --> 1410.31
younger range but that is a mistake

1404.98 --> 1410.31
technically come on what is this

1421.36 --> 1425.1999999999998
Jose I don't know if you're noticing but

1423.49 --> 1428.41
you're calling the entire master bee

1460.54 --> 1464.92
getting a lot of typos going no I cannot

type fast enough in the phone so it's

1464.92 --> 1472.96
difficult oh dear oh okay now I got this

1470.59 --> 1475.57
stuff because I had things to say I have

1472.96 --> 1478.3600000000001
I got my own opinions and I was temping

1475.57 --> 1479.8899999999999
my own opinions about the book about me

1478.36 --> 1483.61
my personal opinion the Bible is a

1479.89 --> 1486.0700000000002
storybook and whatever before I got time

1483.61 --> 1488.11
out the comments there was super

1486.07 --> 1489.8799999999999
unnecessary to get time around they were

1488.11 --> 1491.62
trolling me Theodore I know fielder

1489.88 --> 1493.2700000000002
what's troubling me they say oh oh say

1491.62 --> 1494.9499999999998
you're looking for a timeout I'm gonna

1493.27 --> 1497.05
give you a timeout you mean this is I

1494.95 --> 1499.0900000000001
know he's throwing his that's bad style

1497.05 --> 1501.01
but somebody read him and they say oh

1499.09 --> 1502.9299999999998
the other is offended let me timeout

1501.01 --> 1505.81
Jose because of that but I already

1502.93 --> 1510.19
happened that was unnecessary I didn't

1505.81 --> 1513.6399999999999
type anything for me to get diaper now

1510.19 --> 1516.55
you did you were what tell me please

1513.64 --> 1520.0
what you were scoffing you were scoffing

1516.55 --> 1522.3999999999999
at the foundations of our belief you can

1520.0 --> 1530.14
disagree that's fine but you were

1522.4 --> 1534.21
scoffing no I'm too busy right now I'm

1530.14 --> 1534.21
trying to fix this thing

1535.88 --> 1540.45
it was unnecessary our way there was no

1538.95 --> 1542.5800000000002
need I didn't type anything I wasn't

1540.45 --> 1544.6200000000001
disrespectful to anybody I said the

1542.58 --> 1545.1
Bible is a storybook and that's it

1544.62 --> 1548.55
pretty much

1545.1 --> 1550.02
that's it and then I think Glynn type is

1548.55 --> 1552.57
say oh there's more there's more

1550.02 --> 1554.94
evidence of era of Jesus done in a

1552.57 --> 1557.1
snottiness I said there's no evidence

1554.94 --> 1559.6200000000001
for Jesus just in a storybook something

1557.1 --> 1561.74
like that that's it what is what is so

1559.62 --> 1566.4899999999998
wrong about that why is they they

1561.74 --> 1568.5
emotional you know a emotional - Kate

1566.49 --> 1571.74
earnest with flat earth and religion I

1568.5 --> 1573.0
mean it has to be separated man these

1571.74 --> 1576.24
people is getting emotional these

1573.0 --> 1579.72
religious people is attacking Flat Earth

1576.24 --> 1581.73
the Sun global for not preaching the

1579.72 --> 1583.71
religion and the Jesus thing I don't

1581.73 --> 1586.05
think it's the same thing I just want to

1583.71 --> 1589.08
apologize but I don't need none of you

1586.05 --> 1591.12
religious zealots is no you personally I

1589.08 --> 1593.6699999999998
will for all the religious zealots in

1591.12 --> 1596.4289999999999
the shed that wanna look a flower like

1593.67 --> 1603.42
it's a big religion you can go now oh

1596.429 --> 1605.7
yeah that's that's yeah no that's

1603.42 --> 1607.8300000000002
exactly what I was afraid of sorry about

1605.7 --> 1611.64
that I'm just I'm trying to fix this

1607.83 --> 1614.52
freaking Skype situation yeah finally

1611.64 --> 1619.6100000000001
managed it yay and then he went swearing

1614.52 --> 1623.25
exactly when I write but yeah Jose

1619.61 --> 1626.4289999999999
that's just over the line there's no

1623.25 --> 1628.559
association here with the religious

1626.429 --> 1630.69
belief in this sense and Flat Earth and

1628.559 --> 1632.72
it's just completely uncalled for to

1630.69 --> 1635.21
strum and everyone in chat with that

1632.72 --> 1638.25
it's just ridiculous

1635.21 --> 1640.95
so yeah if you're gonna be like this

1638.25 --> 1642.78
then maybe just stick to hanging around

1640.95 --> 1646.6200000000001
in your own channel and don't go looking

1642.78 --> 1650.67
for fights here because just you're not

1646.62 --> 1654.05

1650.67 --> 1656.8500000000001
your opinions you can have your feelings

1654.05 --> 1661.87
you can have your own philosophy but

1656.85 --> 1673.6589999999999

1735.64 --> 1740.3200000000002

the dog at the minute I'm not gonna be

1740.32 --> 1743.559
able to have an in-depth conversation

1741.24 --> 1746.7
now I'm gonna be outside I got a better

1743.559 --> 1750.36
jacket aren't you okay oh you're not

you're not coming on my show are you oh

1750.36 --> 1756.2099999999998
yeah Trish just declined how did you how

1755.11 --> 1760.08
interesting

1756.21 --> 1762.789
come on Trish join let's sort this out

1760.08 --> 1764.11
I'm out walking the dog I'm not even in

1762.789 --> 1765.76
that position I was deeply deeply

1764.11 --> 1767.59
meaningful but at least I'm preferred to

1765.76 --> 1771.789
join your ass on let's hear what you've

1767.59 --> 1781.24
got to say pick up the phone Trish pick

1771.789 --> 1784.72
up the folder for those that are not

1781.24 --> 1787.1490000000001
aware Ruster asked me you message me

1784.72 --> 1789.3700000000001
maybe your week ago asking whether or

1787.149 --> 1789.6999999999998
not I could vouch for Trish being a

1789.37 --> 1792.61
lawyer

1789.7 --> 1794.63
apparently odd Trish I've seen proof

1792.61 --> 1796.25
that Trish is a lawyer

1794.63 --> 1798.5600000000002
that isn't true I have not seen any

1796.25 --> 1801.17
proof that Trish is a lawyer I didn't

1798.56 --> 1804.47
ask for any she didn't volunteer any the

1801.17 --> 1807.5900000000001
conversation did not happen so the claim

1804.47 --> 1808.46
that I can vouch for Trish's a lawyer is

1807.59 --> 1810.74
not true

1808.46 --> 1812.66
what Trish's apparently said publicly

1810.74 --> 1815.27
that I can attest for her being a lawyer

1812.66 --> 1817.01
I cannot and I do not attest for Trish

1815.27 --> 1818.93
being a lawyer I suspect she's not on a

1817.01 --> 1820.73
lawyer I suspect she's a paralegal an

1818.93 --> 1823.0700000000002
experienced paralegal but nonetheless

1820.73 --> 1825.41
not a lawyer she's made some mistakes

1823.07 --> 1827.45
some mistakes in legal research that a

1825.41 --> 1829.88
lawyer doesn't make what Trish's made

1827.45 --> 1831.92
them and I can pull them out I can't

1829.88 --> 1834.5
justify why they're a mistake and I can

1831.92 --> 1836.21
demonstrate that they're a mistake but

1834.5 --> 1841.13
she won't admit them so she's either

1836.21 --> 1843.02
dishonest or she's a what's the word a

1841.13 --> 1844.7
bigoted zealot so she won't accept the

1843.02 --> 1848.62
possibility that she might be wrong but

1844.7 --> 1851.75
either way or or she could just have

1848.62 --> 1853.34
series tendencies to pathologically

1851.75 --> 1856.94
lying because she's now already

1853.34 --> 1859.97
backtracking on everything well she was

1856.94 --> 1861.8300000000002
challenging me to debate her life and

1859.97 --> 1864.89
then when I started addressing certain

1861.83 --> 1867.11
things she backed down to she's making a

1864.89 --> 1868.97
video on some other channel so she'd

1867.11 --> 1871.1
gone from being a live debate until now

1868.97 --> 1875.06
making a video and it was when I started

1871.1 --> 1877.25
challenging certain things where now I'm

1875.06 --> 1879.8
not afraid to debate Trish lies on this

1877.25 --> 1881.21
topic I encourage the disagreements

1879.8 --> 1883.07
because I want to see how strong the

1881.21 --> 1885.32
argument is against the Hilo subject

1883.07 --> 1887.75
model being taught it's clearly illegal

1885.32 --> 1889.79
in my eyes it doesn't even need any

1887.75 --> 1891.11
debate it's clearly illegal but if

1889.79 --> 1894.1399999999999
somebody thinks that it's not illegal

1891.11 --> 1896.27
then let's have the conversation but if

1894.14 --> 1898.3400000000001
that person claims to be a lawyer and

1896.27 --> 1900.08
then further claims that I can support

1898.34 --> 1902.0
the assertion that she's a lawyer

1900.08 --> 1904.85
then that person must need to be a

1902.0 --> 1908.12
lawyer so the issue really is did she

1904.85 --> 1910.1299999999999
use me by proxy to support the assertion

1908.12 --> 1912.59
that she is a lawyer because if she did

1910.13 --> 1913.7600000000002
do that I did not under not support

1912.59 --> 1915.1699999999998
these surgeons she's a lawyer don't

1913.76 --> 1917.15
think she is one I think she's a

1915.17 --> 1920.3000000000002
paralegal and it happened with Ruster

1917.15 --> 1922.52
apparently and maybe two weeks ago yeah

1920.3 --> 1925.28
must be taken into consideration that in

1922.52 --> 1927.809
the last two years I've never contacted

1925.28 --> 1930.269
sleeping warrior regarding an issue that

1927.809 --> 1932.539
absolutely pertinent just something it

1930.269 --> 1935.519
was actively happening at that time and

1932.539 --> 1938.549
these traits that make a Skype call

1935.519 --> 1941.129
given my history with sleeping warrior

1938.549 --> 1944.34
and my history with the rest of the

1941.129 --> 1945.869
people within flattered I think it's

1944.34 --> 1948.779
pretty clear that everybody knows I

1945.869 --> 1951.779
don't go making calls unless there's a

1948.779 --> 1953.759
provocation simple as that everybody I

1951.779 --> 1955.979
know what it was I know what it was it

1953.759 --> 1958.1390000000001
was when I when I asked her for evidence

1955.979 --> 1959.849
of a current practices certificate now

1958.139 --> 1960.33
Trish claims that that would be Daxing

1959.849 --> 1962.519
herself

1960.33 --> 1964.559
it isn't daxing herself because all

1962.519 --> 1966.96
Trish's got a do is show photographic ID

1964.559 --> 1968.249
with her picture her face on it and then

1966.96 --> 1970.109
show that the name on the certificate

1968.249 --> 1972.359
matches the name on the photographic ID

1970.109 --> 1973.9789999999998
you don't have to show you address I'm

1972.359 --> 1977.9689999999998
not interested in your address I didn't

1973.979 --> 1978.419
even beat that though for my against

1977.969 --> 1980.519
true

1978.419 --> 1983.3690000000001
it was simply freedom say yes or no

1980.519 --> 1986.429
Riley because she used that in my

1983.369 --> 1988.7289999999998
challenging of her legal credentials she

1986.429 --> 1992.729
said basically that I should seek out

1988.729 --> 1996.21
the proof from both you and Nathan and

1992.729 --> 1997.95
so I left it at that and chat because I

1996.21 --> 1999.359
figured that that would be simple enough

1997.95 --> 2002.809
and I told her it was gonna be simple

1999.359 --> 2004.82
and but I wasn't expecting you to return

2002.809 --> 2007.219
the answer that you did but in all

2004.82 --> 2008.4189999999999
reality I had no reason to call you

2007.219 --> 2009.679
given that I was in the middle of a

2008.419 --> 2012.6490000000001
conversation with her

2009.679 --> 2014.8090000000002
you know Oh in that conversation with

2012.649 --> 2017.389
Nathan and I I presented evidence to

2014.809 --> 2019.19
Trish of my credentials she didn't ask

2017.389 --> 2021.4399999999998
for them I volunteered them without

2019.19 --> 2023.419
duress the I was literally the first

2021.44 --> 2027.279
thing I said they go Trish there's my

2023.419 --> 2029.8690000000001
Paul Scott they even had a conversation

2027.279 --> 2032.419
basically so the only way that I had

2029.869 --> 2035.33
even like that you would even be brought

2032.419 --> 2036.6490000000001
into this was by her basically because I

2035.33 --> 2039.049
was aware that you had had a

2036.649 --> 2041.6589999999999
conversation with her so therefore the

2039.049 --> 2044.089
only reason that I contacted you was to

2041.659 --> 2046.279
use provocation for using you as her

2044.089 --> 2049.069
defense against my challenge to her

2046.279 --> 2051.5
legal credentials because with my having

2049.069 --> 2054.109
zero prior awareness to you having a

2051.5 --> 2057.409
conversation with her or anything to

2054.109 --> 2059.45
that extent I just have no way of having

2057.409 --> 2061.94
any contact she will knowledge of their

2059.45 --> 2068.629
court on the camera

2061.94 --> 2071.629
question of validation for her frankly

2068.629 --> 2075.889
there'd be no reason or rational reason

2071.629 --> 2078.5299999999997
to contact with that question no so just

2075.889 --> 2080.599
let's be really clear I did not and do

2078.53 --> 2082.909
not have any evidence the Trish is a

2080.599 --> 2084.77
lawyer she will know doctor self why

2082.909 --> 2086.389
producing evidence that she is a lawyer

2084.77 --> 2087.8
she just produces evidence that she's a

2086.389 --> 2089.389
lawyer in the form of a practice

2087.8 --> 2091.25
difficult current practice difficult

2089.389 --> 2092.7200000000003
with the name Trish on it and then proof

2091.25 --> 2094.94
that that name on there is her

2092.72 --> 2096.98
photographic ID doesn't need to be any

2094.94 --> 2098.9
Doc's information no one's interested in

2096.98 --> 2100.64
doctors information on my side nobody

2098.9 --> 2103.2200000000003
so if Trish thinks that there's a Doc's

2100.64 --> 2104.96
issue she's wrong just a current

2103.22 --> 2106.49
practice it practice and certificate is

2104.96 --> 2108.19
all you need to push and prove that you

2106.49 --> 2110.2999999999997
is that name on that on that certificate

2108.19 --> 2112.25
you're doing though can't let their

2110.3 --> 2114.1400000000003
private Skype calls basically and others

2112.25 --> 2116.3
had to take place on the air but because

2114.14 --> 2118.04
she handled in the way that she did the

2116.3 --> 2118.79
handles are publicly in chats the way

2118.04 --> 2121.49
that she does

2118.79 --> 2124.339
there's only basically leaving us with

2121.49 --> 2125.5699999999997
one choice in a manner to handle it to

2124.339 --> 2127.19
be honest with you when you originally

2125.57 --> 2130.04
asked me the question did she give me

2127.19 --> 2131.3
proof she was a lawyer I thought that

2130.04 --> 2132.95
you were just checking her out because

2131.3 --> 2134.15
you're being inquisitive I didn't

2132.95 --> 2137.72
realize it was because you died already

2134.15 --> 2139.79
out of disagreement with her no I had I

2137.72 --> 2142.0099999999998
wouldn't think for a second that you

2139.79 --> 2144.17
would hold any type of proof on her

2142.01 --> 2147.6400000000003
behalf or anything and so when she said

2144.17 --> 2152.0
that frankly my jaw dropped and so

2147.64 --> 2154.16
therefore given my contacts with you I

2152.0 --> 2155.72
figured it wasn't gonna take a lot of

2154.16 --> 2158.1189999999997
effort for me to just go ahead and eat

2155.72 --> 2160.8799999999997
you up immediately about that yeah

2158.119 --> 2163.04
unless you feel again to be really clear

2160.88 --> 2165.17
Trish does have proof of my

2163.04 --> 2167.93
qualifications she's seen it she has

2165.17 --> 2170.1800000000003
copies of it so it what's the problem

2167.93 --> 2171.9199999999996
Trish don't have to dock yourself you

2170.18 --> 2173.1189999999997
don't have to show you address just

2171.92 --> 2174.56
prove that you are the name on the

2173.119 --> 2176.869
certificate with a photographic form of

2174.56 --> 2178.91
identification no docks details needs to

2176.869 --> 2180.26
be given and to be honest Trish if you

2178.91 --> 2182.0
think about it I could find you if I

2180.26 --> 2183.71
really wanted to do anyway just by

2182.0 --> 2185.81
looking upon loss society I'm sure

2183.71 --> 2186.98
they've got a public register it

2185.81 --> 2189.2
wouldn't be that difficult for me to

2186.98 --> 2190.4900000000002
work it out if it really wanted to it's

2189.2 --> 2191.6299999999997
more essentially whether or not you're

2190.49 --> 2193.0699999999997
honest and see and whether you can

2191.63 --> 2193.82
surrender the information you claim you

2193.07 --> 2197.3
have

2193.82 --> 2199.61
uh yeah and whatever the bar as

2197.3 --> 2202.1000000000004
Australian bar equivalency is basically

2199.61 --> 2206.09
I mean here in America we have the bar

2202.1 --> 2209.0299999999997
and so there's a registry of all people

2206.09 --> 2211.34
who are active basically uh basically

2209.03 --> 2213.2000000000003
bar certificate holders meaning that

2211.34 --> 2215.3900000000003
there this was legally qualified to

2213.2 --> 2217.2799999999997
practice law and basically even if

2215.39 --> 2219.2
they're not currently practicing that

2217.28 --> 2221.15
doesn't mean that they basically that

2219.2 --> 2222.3799999999997
they they'll still be qualified even

2221.15 --> 2223.64
that you're not learning factor things

2222.38 --> 2225.61
so there's gonna be an australian

2223.64 --> 2228.29
equivalency to that that should be

2225.61 --> 2230.69
public registry so shouldn't take that

2228.29 --> 2233.6
much effort well it gets worse oak was

2230.69 --> 2235.67
in the josé's chat yesterday and because

2233.6 --> 2237.98
spurs is not really off on the lingo

2235.67 --> 2240.86
spears aster the question are you a

2237.98 --> 2242.3
barrister well in England I'm I don't

2240.86 --> 2244.07
know whether that's true in America I

2242.3 --> 2246.59
don't know about Australia this might be

2244.07 --> 2248.0
down to a legal thing if it is then an

2246.59 --> 2250.1000000000004
adjustment and correction can be made

2248.0 --> 2251.99
but to answer the question are you a

2250.1 --> 2253.4
barrister with the word yes after

2251.99 --> 2254.4199999999996
telling me that you're a lawyer or

2253.4 --> 2254.96
telling other people that you're a

2254.42 --> 2256.88
lawyer

2254.96 --> 2258.26
that is not an interchangeable term

2256.88 --> 2260.48
there is a difference between a

2258.26 --> 2262.34
barrister and a lawyer now maybe it's

2260.48 --> 2264.08
different in Australia I don't know what

2262.34 --> 2265.82
in England I can't call yourself both

2264.08 --> 2268.97
embarrassed and the lawyer you want all

2265.82 --> 2270.65
the other what you don't want I don't

2268.97 --> 2273.04
use a lawyer I think that she's a

2270.65 --> 2273.04
paralegal

2273.22 --> 2281.39
finally finally sorry it just refuted to

2278.72 --> 2283.31
if refused to add it at Trish but I

2281.39 --> 2287.6
finally managed to get her through

2283.31 --> 2290.87
another way so well you're really noisy

2287.6 --> 2297.5499999999997
by the way Riley I'm outside walking the

2290.87 --> 2305.96
dog yeah hello Trish hey Alan what's up

2297.55 --> 2307.73
so long so in a chat rusta I told you to

2305.96 --> 2309.41
walk reach out to sleeping warrior and

2307.73 --> 2311.03
Nathan to prove I was a lawyer

2309.41 --> 2313.45
I've never proved I was a lawyer do

2311.03 --> 2313.4500000000003
anyone

2314.54 --> 2321.14
badi I know that you haven't proved it

2316.79 --> 2332.86
but that do I think it's not about the

2321.14 --> 2339.41
proof it's about the claim I character

2332.86 --> 2342.71
Trish Trish let me say I care I care

2339.41 --> 2345.6499999999996
Trish I care because if you are using me

2342.71 --> 2348.62
if you're using me by proxy to validate

2345.65 --> 2349.1600000000003
your claim of being a lawyer you let him

2348.62 --> 2356.9
finish

2349.16 --> 2359.0299999999997
let him finish please what the issue the

2356.9 --> 2367.04
issue is did you use me as a proxy to

2359.03 --> 2369.11
validate don't make this into a Jerry

2367.04 --> 2385.64
Springer Show okay we're not done with

2369.11 --> 2387.86
you yet Trish come on Trish Trish did

2385.64 --> 2390.02
you realize that maybe the trolls that

2387.86 --> 2391.85
were first cooperating with you have

2390.02 --> 2414.92
turned against you because that is what

2391.85 --> 2424.16
trolls do and they have no Trish tone it

2414.92 --> 2437.54
down the issues not whether or not to

2424.16 --> 2439.19
validate then let's Rusted let's see

2437.54 --> 2440.57
what roster says rusta she says that

2439.19 --> 2442.1
you're lying that she never made the

2440.57 --> 2443.69
claim that I am me or Nathan that

2442.1 --> 2446.68
evidence that she proof that she was a

2443.69 --> 2449.809
lawyer she says you're lying

2446.68 --> 2452.24
well just like everything else that she

2449.809 --> 2454.6400000000003
said she backpedals and so it's just a

2452.24 --> 2457.4599999999996
matter of hours until I find this I have

2454.64 --> 2459.14
about a seven-day date window of debates

2457.46 --> 2461.059
to go through at most but I'm pretty

2459.14 --> 2462.89
sure I've already found the one and I

2461.059 --> 2464.7400000000002
think I'm within a 30-minute time window

2462.89 --> 2466.5789999999997
on on finding the actual chats

2464.74 --> 2469.04
unfortunately she has me blocks on

2466.579 --> 2471.1400000000003
having to read them one-sided but it's

2469.04 --> 2472.97
still just not very difficult because

2471.14 --> 2474.589
all the context is there so it's just a

2472.97 --> 2476.39
matter of hours until I find this and

2474.589 --> 2482.21
have the screenshots it is what it is

2476.39 --> 2484.549
you can't deny your gypsy trash okay

2482.21 --> 2487.0
yeah Trish I married you because just

2484.549 --> 2489.319
constantly using the f-word is not

2487.0 --> 2491.93
productive for anyone so if you want to

2489.319 --> 2494.42
speak up then please click the the

2491.93 --> 2499.1499999999996
microphone button to mute yourself if

2494.42 --> 2499.15
you have anything productive left to say

2502.34 --> 2505.719
[Music]

2507.069 --> 2514.819
okay shut your [ __ ] mouth

2509.51 --> 2523.3390000000004
don't go and do that again why don't you

2514.819 --> 2525.109
just address the claim sleeping warrior

2523.339 --> 2527.0299999999997
head evidence okay

2525.109 --> 2529.369
that I was a lawyer I haven't proved

2527.03 --> 2531.4100000000003
myself to sleep before I don't need to

2529.369 --> 2541.13
show my practicing certificate and my

2531.41 --> 2551.049
driver's license approved are you a

2541.13 --> 2551.049
lawyer since you no longer have survived

2551.26 --> 2564.6800000000003
hey come on all right I could be

2559.369 --> 2566.839
whatever I want to be the fact is come

2564.68 --> 2574.22
on Russ I let her ramble on for a moment

2566.839 --> 2577.609
then after that you go no one wants to

2574.22 --> 2579.7999999999997
hear your monologue yeah just continue

2577.609 --> 2583.22
your point Trish and then Rustica

2579.8 --> 2585.71
speak Rasta I never told the sleepy war

2583.22 --> 2586.52
I had any evidence that I was a lawyer

2585.71 --> 2588.83
okay

2586.52 --> 2597.05
now at the end of the day all right it

2588.83 --> 2600.35
doesn't matter if I'm a lawyer it does

2597.05 --> 2603.9500000000003
it Trish it does if you made the claim

2600.35 --> 2606.74
that you were that is all oh you are

2603.95 --> 2609.23
okay so right so you are a lawyer that

2606.74 --> 2611.87
has not presented any evidence and you

2609.23 --> 2615.32
retract any claim that you ever had any

2611.87 --> 2619.6099999999997
evidence that's fine no but that's

2615.32 --> 2621.05
technically what you're doing I'm not

2619.61 --> 2634.79
gonna give sleepy where am i practicing

2621.05 --> 2636.8300000000004
still getting my driver's license right

2634.79 --> 2640.04
so that's know that that is cleared up

2636.83 --> 2642.2
Trish never claimed that she shared any

2640.04 --> 2644.63
evidence of her actually being a lawyer

2642.2 --> 2647.48
despite her making the claim so let's

2644.63 --> 2649.4900000000002
move on from that point let's respond to

2647.48 --> 2651.44
that fact that she claims still to be a

2649.49 --> 2660.56
lawyer and has not presented any proof

2651.44 --> 2675.17
for it the context is all there right so

2660.56 --> 2676.7599999999998
let me just ask you questions guys let

2675.17 --> 2679.1
me ask you questions Trish can you tell

2676.76 --> 2680.9300000000003
me in Australia is there a difference

2679.1 --> 2688.67
between a barrister and a solicitor or

2680.93 --> 2690.47
not documents so you said you said that

2688.67 --> 2692.87
you're a lawyer that look that term

2690.47 --> 2694.1
lawyer is one of those broad terms that

2692.87 --> 2696.44
can mean different things in different

2694.1 --> 2697.94
parts of the world when you say yeah

2696.44 --> 2701.51
what do you mean do you mean you're a

2697.94 --> 2704.75
barrister or a solicitor I'm a barrister

2701.51 --> 2706.0400000000004
what does it mean well Amar's because if

2704.75 --> 2707.78
you're not a solicitor then you are a

2706.04 --> 2709.56
barrister if you're not a barrister you

2707.78 --> 2715.71
are a solicitor and I wanna know

2709.56 --> 2717.0299999999997
right so here a Boris's ended if you're

2715.71 --> 2719.54
a barrister you won't be registered at

2717.03 --> 2722.9100000000003
the Law Society as a lawyer will you'd

2719.54 --> 2725.07
know you'd be read as a barrister I've

2722.91 --> 2731.97
got my barracks in I do criminal

2725.07 --> 2733.05
litigation interchangeably that's not

2731.97 --> 2741.6
interchangeable and it's confusing

2733.05 --> 2743.73
people getting my driver's license to

2741.6 --> 2746.61
toady okay and then last night on

2743.73 --> 2748.619
Nathan's channel Chui wants to say my

2746.61 --> 2761.4300000000003
boyfriend's toady and I'm a paralegal

2748.619 --> 2762.6000000000004
[ __ ] but I'll show them my credentials

2761.43 --> 2765.45
okay

2762.6 --> 2768.45
now you told me that rusty had evidence

2765.45 --> 2770.8799999999997
that I told rusty that you had evidence

2768.45 --> 2772.4399999999996
I was a lawyer never once did I say that

2770.88 --> 2782.04
don't ever call me out for lying because

2772.44 --> 2783.4500000000003
I speak in truth I'm not you my

2782.04 --> 2785.7
apprentice in certificate because you

2783.45 --> 2788.31
know what I don't need to be doxed the

2785.7 --> 2807.5699999999997
various reasons as I see it on Jose's

2788.31 --> 2818.67
Channel last night and little boy rusta

2807.57 --> 2830.31
think I am ever since you arrived on the

2818.67 --> 2832.5
scene I am a gypsy and whoa no the issue

2830.31 --> 2835.82
is whether or not my name is a proxy to

2832.5 --> 2835.82
support your claim has been a lawyer

2843.26 --> 2848.9900000000002
no one Keys never told Russ to the use

2852.05 --> 2858.96
everyone hates shoes you know deal with

2855.48 --> 2861.0
that warrior here we go

2858.96 --> 2863.55
never told rusty yet evidence I was all

2861.0 --> 2867.12
happy never ones came there so whose

2863.55 --> 2868.13
line it's gonna come down to finding

2867.12 --> 2870.75
where it came from

2868.13 --> 2874.82
well guys these guys if I may intervene

2870.75 --> 2878.61
for a moment there's two hours left yeah

2874.82 --> 2881.07
or she's so confused with her knowledge

2878.61 --> 2883.35
of words and how things really were

2881.07 --> 2909.1200000000003
hello that she's no imminent ly mucked

2883.35 --> 2915.15
things up rhasta deserves a chance to

2909.12 --> 2917.73
respond sleeping warrior that I'll

2915.15 --> 2919.56
provide my credentials to Tony I'll

2917.73 --> 2922.05
provide apprentice things ticket in a

2919.56 --> 2923.97
driver's license I never once told rusta

2922.05 --> 2925.6800000000003
that sleeping warriors got any evidence

2923.97 --> 2927.72
that I'm a lawyer a barrister

2925.68 --> 2929.7
a solicitor what if you want to call it

2927.72 --> 2931.35
now I've called you out sleeping warrior

2929.7 --> 2935.24
for a [ __ ] debate you scared and

2931.35 --> 2935.24
you're running and this is deflection

2938.48 --> 2957.81
Trish I am not scared of you in any way

2940.8 --> 2966.6000000000004
don't be don't be pro noid I am

2957.81 --> 2966.96
absolutely not afraid of you at all on

2966.6 --> 2974.8199999999997
your own

2966.96 --> 2977.19
Bluff currently Trish because I know

2974.82 --> 2980.1200000000003
sleeping warrior for years now I'm

2977.19 --> 2985.02
pretty sure he's not afraid of you

2980.12 --> 2986.88
fooling yourself issue Trish Trish the

2985.02 --> 2988.5
only issue is whether or not you told

2986.88 --> 2991.1400000000003
roster that I could vouch for you as a

2988.5 --> 2992.73
lawyer rather than as a barrister well

2991.14 --> 2994.14
you say that so let's get rusted to

2992.73 --> 3015.59
prove it because I'm sure you will be

2994.14 --> 3022.37
able to speak for a second woman yes

3015.59 --> 3028.55
you've got well I think you did so let's

3022.37 --> 3029.72
see if you can prove I only got into

3028.55 --> 3031.5800000000004
Russia in the last hour

3029.72 --> 3039.23
and I'm out with the dog right oh so

3031.58 --> 3044.36
it's not rolling through chats right now

3039.23 --> 3047.48
I'll find you that sleeping why evidence

3044.36 --> 3050.1200000000003
that I'm a lawyer I think you should

3047.48 --> 3064.88
sleep in warrior would vouch for you as

3050.12 --> 3066.44
well as supports this assertion that you

3064.88 --> 3068.0
used me and Nathan to vouch for you

3066.44 --> 3070.88
being a lawyer then there's an issue

3068.0 --> 3072.56
there isn't there what do you mean what

3070.88 --> 3073.01
did I say that you've got evidence I'm a

3072.56 --> 3074.7799999999997
lawyer

3073.01 --> 3079.48
I never told Rosco you've got evidence

3074.78 --> 3079.48
I'm a lawyer well let's listen to I say

3084.61 --> 3093.44
no you just got the claims you're not

3091.61 --> 3095.51
making a good case for yourself by

3093.44 --> 3099.55
saying yeah you don't have evidence I'm

3095.51 --> 3099.55
a lawyer but I'm making the claim that's

3102.97 --> 3106.3599999999997
making the claim

3108.289 --> 3112.69
yesterday I'll provide my credentials

3114.549 --> 3120.019
it's about lying and saying that Riley

3118.069 --> 3133.22
and Nathan could vouch for you when

3120.019 --> 3136.729
challenged by my others Nathan can vouch

3133.22 --> 3138.799
for you or come up with a new answer to

3136.729 --> 3173.2889999999998
my original claim against you which is

3138.799 --> 3192.71
that you're not a lawyer this is a

3173.289 --> 3195.38
conversation with you and I've given

3192.71 --> 3196.9990000000003
Trish credit numerous times that she's

3195.38 --> 3198.92
come up with the best argument I've come

3196.999 --> 3200.479
across so far I don't agree with her

3198.92 --> 3202.309
I think it's fundamentally and fatally

3200.479 --> 3204.049
flawed legally for different reasons to

3202.309 --> 3207.7690000000002
the merits of the case but nonetheless

3204.049 --> 3213.43
it's better than Jim Ponder's and our

3207.769 --> 3213.43
exes never Anderson's arguments to date

3220.45 --> 3227.8689999999997
anybody to do anything my own bowels

3224.869 --> 3230.089
well I'm not what where is the proof for

3227.869 --> 3233.4500000000003
your claim that those are Riley's trolls

3230.089 --> 3236.089
okay I've never had any kind of I've

3233.45 --> 3238.489
never seen any trolls that I thought

3236.089 --> 3240.7889999999998
were originating from Riley of any

3238.489 --> 3240.789
people

3243.65 --> 3248.13
you didn't call a page sleeping warrior

3246.39 --> 3250.35
and have a conversation with their iPad

3248.13 --> 3261.78
at all oh so you're saying that the

3250.35 --> 3264.95
trolls are page she disagrees with yeah

3261.78 --> 3274.53
okay cool whatever it doesn't matter

3264.95 --> 3292.3799999999997
does disagree with you because of your

3274.53 --> 3293.9100000000003
behavior well if you're going to say

3292.38 --> 3296.4300000000003
that there's no evidence to support the

3293.91 --> 3298.29
assertion from roster that you used me

3296.43 --> 3300.4199999999996
in Natan as a proxy to support the claim

3298.29 --> 3302.2799999999997
that you're a barrister whatever gesture

3300.42 --> 3305.4
that supports your claim that I've got

3302.28 --> 3315.5400000000004
trolls onto you I'm not trying to

3305.4 --> 3318.51
semantic games with your I what Riley

3315.54 --> 3320.16
does you mean being a lawyer like you

3318.51 --> 3324.4700000000003
claim you are you're complaining about

3320.16 --> 3324.47
him acting like a lawyer you're a lawyer

3336.8 --> 3341.52
if your position is that there's no

3339.09 --> 3342.81
evidence from roster that supports the

3341.52 --> 3344.22
assertion that you said that me and

3342.81 --> 3346.29
Nathan gave proxy that you were a lawyer

3344.22 --> 3352.02
then it's the same argument for me I'm

3346.29 --> 3353.85
in trial sound she left because she's a

3352.02 --> 3355.859
rotten dirty gypsy that knows she's

3353.85 --> 3357.66
lying and doubling down continually and

3355.859 --> 3359.67
has nothing to say about it except from

3357.66 --> 3362.85
worth trailer park wrong side of the

3359.67 --> 3365.2200000000003
railroad tracks I think it's funny that

3362.85 --> 3368.3399999999997
she criticizes you for not having any

3365.22 --> 3370.35
evidence against her that said when she

3368.34 --> 3371.67
said that me and Nathan would vote for

3370.35 --> 3374.339
Abbey in a barrister or

3371.67 --> 3376.02
lawyer she's died you men against you

3374.339 --> 3377.819
but when not saying I didn't think she

3376.02 --> 3379.89
was lying that's why I didn't take

3377.819 --> 3381.75
screenshots at the time because I

3379.89 --> 3387.3289999999997
figured it was such a whole claim that

3381.75 --> 3389.04
it must have been true position that

3387.329 --> 3390.27
she's not lying but when I point out

3389.04 --> 3392.16
that she's got no evidence that I

3390.27 --> 3394.02
stepped roles onto it then all of a

3392.16 --> 3398.819
sudden that semantics and I'm like yeah

3394.02 --> 3401.069
that's some antics is by trying to use

3398.819 --> 3403.349
it like that that was an incorrect usage

3401.069 --> 3405.45
of board semantics education just for

3403.349 --> 3407.94
the record Trish Blythe just said in jet

3405.45 --> 3412.04
that apparently this name is a pseudonym

3407.94 --> 3412.04
and not her real name for the record

3413.21 --> 3420.42
she's been a dirty liar ha ha ha more

3416.819 --> 3427.079
proof more it's okay that she's using

3420.42 --> 3428.79
the pseudonym the issue is proof she's a

3427.079 --> 3429.63
barrister not a lawyer a barrister

3428.79 --> 3432.15
because they're not interchangeable

3429.63 --> 3434.819
words and she knows that by using them

3432.15 --> 3436.109
words to me I know that that means that

3434.819 --> 3438.18
she's either using them interchangeably

3436.109 --> 3439.2599999999998
incorrectly or she's deceiving people

3438.18 --> 3441.359
because you can't use them

3439.26 --> 3444.48
interchangeably this would have been the

3441.359 --> 3447.869
first unprovoked call that I've ever

3444.48 --> 3452.369
made virtual contact with you in almost

3447.869 --> 3453.65
three years somewhat contentious I can't

3452.369 --> 3456.4500000000003
remember what it was but I remember

3453.65 --> 3459.2400000000002
somewhat contentious exactly and then

3456.45 --> 3462.3289999999997
before that we were on a war room called

3459.24 --> 3465.4799999999996
back in the day when I was on the iron

3462.329 --> 3468.96
real media Show with Adam McKinnon and

3465.48 --> 3471.48
Josh quarry yeah but it's always been

3468.96 --> 3474.96
stuff that has all been very important

3471.48 --> 3478.14
and few and far between and never

3474.96 --> 3481.77
without direct Convocation I just have a

3478.14 --> 3484.14
long history of zero unnecessary contact

3481.77 --> 3485.73
with you or pretty much anybody else

3484.14 --> 3487.799
with employers for that matter like it

3485.73 --> 3490.68
always matters and it's always upon

3487.799 --> 3493.109
provocation and so why would I alter

3490.68 --> 3495.6299999999997
history the reason why it's important is

3493.109 --> 3497.5789999999997
because if if if it's true that she used

3495.63 --> 3499.38
me and Nathan as a proxy to support the

3497.579 --> 3500.6400000000003
assertion that she's a lawyer that means

3499.38 --> 3502.48
that you were deceived into thinking

3500.64 --> 3504.67
that she was a lawyer or a barrister

3502.48 --> 3506.08
that deception well that's actually a

3504.67 --> 3507.9700000000003
criminal actors plus an office and et

3506.08 --> 3510.58
pretending to be a lawyer when you know

3507.97 --> 3512.56
actually so if it is the case that she

3510.58 --> 3514.359
did use that to support the assertion

3512.56 --> 3516.22
she's a lawyer then that is a criminal

3514.359 --> 3518.59
offense but we have another claim from

3516.22 --> 3521.23
James that I have in the Hat today that

3518.59 --> 3523.09
I drew out you know a flat earthers to

3521.23 --> 3539.17
call and make the claim that they were

3523.09 --> 3542.53
the ones yeah I mean that just like read

3539.17 --> 3545.17
a roster yeah Trish actually just made a

3542.53 --> 3547.4500000000003
claim in chat that that picture is

3545.17 --> 3551.5
actually her just thought you'd be

3547.45 --> 3557.71
interested to hear man she must have

3551.5 --> 3558.97
been born at a bar to you rusty

3557.71 --> 3561.19
now it's whether or not you can find

3558.97 --> 3563.4399999999996
that evidence that says words to the

3561.19 --> 3565.03
effect of Nathan and Riley will attest

3563.44 --> 3566.619
to me being a lawyer or whatever it was

3565.03 --> 3568.119
the phraseology that she said because if

3566.619 --> 3569.5
she did use me and naked as a proxy to

3568.119 --> 3571.57
support I research in have being a

3569.5 --> 3575.59
lawyer that is deception because I did

3571.57 --> 3576.5800000000004
not happen she's admitted she's admitted

3575.59 --> 3579.3
that she shouldn't give us any

3576.58 --> 3582.52
information through all forms now and

3579.3 --> 3584.9500000000003
then when Nathan goes live and I mean

3582.52 --> 3586.119
because you basically I saw this right

3584.95 --> 3587.08
before I was getting ready to go to bed

3586.119 --> 3588.52
I'm ended up pulling an all-nighter

3587.08 --> 3593.38
because this is just such a

3588.52 --> 3597.19
laughingstock so I'm pretty sure that

3593.38 --> 3599.9500000000003
with say no more than than three hours

3597.19 --> 3601.6
at most after Nathan's live I'll have

3599.95 --> 3612.33
the screenshots and stuff I mean it's

3601.6 --> 3614.47
just I've no history of the reason why

3612.33 --> 3615.88
the reason why I prod their current

3614.47 --> 3618.64
practices certificate and photographic

3615.88 --> 3620.8
ID is useful it's not to prove that

3618.64 --> 3622.75
she's telling the truth it would be used

3620.8 --> 3624.34
to prove that Ruster was lying because

3622.75 --> 3625.359
if she could prove that she was in

3624.34 --> 3627.7000000000003
practice as a lawyer

3625.359 --> 3629.44
then why she wouldn't need to tell you

3627.7 --> 3631.43
that Nathan and I would vouch for it

3629.44 --> 3634.01
because she can prove it

3631.43 --> 3638.69
I mean they can buy poetry I hope thing

3634.01 --> 3642.8190000000004
is much simpler than that it's like I'm

3638.69 --> 3642.819
scheduled and we don't really have

3645.039 --> 3650.1800000000003
active acquaintances unnecessary women

3647.96 --> 3652.64
clutter basically and once again it

3650.18 --> 3656.02
comes down to the fact that I no way

3652.64 --> 3656.02
should ever

3662.079 --> 3668.98
Whydah wait Trish is still like trying

3666.26 --> 3671.779
to rally the trolls against us in chat

3668.98 --> 3674.809
so I get what she needed the comfort of

3671.779 --> 3676.369
the sock troll stuff to soothe her

3674.809 --> 3678.38
wounds Wow

3676.369 --> 3680.42
she actually left the actual

3678.38 --> 3688.1600000000003
conversation so yeah Trish you can come

3680.42 --> 3692.23
back any time you know you know continue

3688.16 --> 3692.23
to contact you only when necessary

3693.35 --> 3696.38
[Music]

3707.92 --> 3721.279
Tony sorry I'm on with the dog still bad

3713.98 --> 3723.2
sorry is it still Bob it's okay now the

3721.279 --> 3724.91
word Pro noid Pro annoyed is the

3723.2 --> 3726.589
opposite of paranoid paranoid is where

3724.91 --> 3727.819
you think everybody's against you Pro

3726.589 --> 3729.98
annoyed is the mistaken belief that

3727.819 --> 3732.14
everybody's in your favor on your side

3729.98 --> 3741.71
these troll sir she thinks are reference

3732.14 --> 3745.49
the neither annoyed blab lers you know

3741.71 --> 3747.529
the the sketch from the onion with the

3745.49 --> 3749.5099999999998
grapplers and the blah blah so everybody

3747.529 --> 3751.279
kind of gets what grapplers are but blab

3749.51 --> 3754.9700000000003
ours are also a thought and I think that

3751.279 --> 3759.14
Trish is like there's really funny sorry

3754.97 --> 3761.089
I was just think she has a tendency to

3759.14 --> 3763.279
think that she's pulling in people to

3761.089 --> 3765.23
support her they're actually like

3763.279 --> 3767.84
longtime friends

3765.23 --> 3769.73
basically like I mean it's just it's

3767.84 --> 3772.25
really really funny that she thinks she

3769.73 --> 3774.29
can come into this new and then think

3772.25 --> 3777.08
that she can wrangle support from people

3774.29 --> 3779.18
that basically you know one or all of us

3777.08 --> 3781.119
have been in contact with for multiple

3779.18 --> 3783.6189999999997
years I mean that's just embarrassing

3781.119 --> 3789.05
it's mostly that she thinks I'm afraid

3783.619 --> 3791.81
of her really made a claim that would

3789.05 --> 3794.27
result in me an instigating Lee

3791.81 --> 3795.89
contacting sleeping warrior I've been

3794.27 --> 3805.94
honestly that takes the cake

3795.89 --> 3807.5899999999997
right there that takes the cake hey guys

3805.94 --> 3812.15
I think I'm gonna round out the show it

3807.59 --> 3814.34
was a yeah it was amusing thanks for

3812.15 --> 3818.06
having us Arwen yeah it was glad to have

3814.34 --> 3821.29
you the bit and flamed but yeah good to

3818.06 --> 3823.85

shots done basically you and I'll post

3828.35 --> 3834.38
them where you know I will you guys

3829.99 --> 3837.02
alright and my closing statement is the

3834.38 --> 3839.06
bottom line is if Trish did try to use

3837.02 --> 3841.07
me and Nathan as proxies to support her

3839.06 --> 3842.84
assertion that she's a barrister that

3841.07 --> 3845.03
deceives people and that is deceptive

3842.84 --> 3846.59
one thing to be wrong but it's another

3845.03 --> 3847.25
thing to do it intentionally and if you

3846.59 --> 3851.3
did do that

3847.25 --> 3856.07
that is deceptive alright well we'll see

3851.3 --> 3857.6600000000003
if Raza can find it I'm sure he will I

3856.07 --> 3860.3900000000003
have more confidence in ruffster finding

3857.66 --> 3864.5299999999997
it than I do have it be an incorrect me
