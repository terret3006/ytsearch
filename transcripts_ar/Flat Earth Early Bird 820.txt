77.68 --> 84.24000000000001
so the weather today is

81.36 --> 86.88
well kind of similar to yesterday there

84.24 --> 90.08
are some clouds now it started out

86.88 --> 90.08
pretty cold in the morning

91.2 --> 94.64
but yeah the sun seems to have cleared

94.24 --> 97.28
up

94.64 --> 97.28
some of that

99.28 --> 102.479
so yeah it's it's been kind of like

101.2 --> 106.24000000000001
moist

102.479 --> 108.32
and cold nights and mornings

106.24 --> 110.96
but then in the afternoon it gets a lot

108.32 --> 112.32
nicer with the sun

110.96 --> 114.32
so that's really what the weather is

112.32 --> 115.75899999999999
like it's still kind of cold outside

114.32 --> 118.719
though

115.759 --> 118.719
despite the sun

123.119 --> 129.84
all right

134.319 --> 143.83999999999997

137.76 --> 143.84
of march 2021

144.239 --> 147.20000000000002
it's a new week

148.319 --> 151.11999999999998

164.319 --> 167.92
what's going to happen with gti

a bit nervously looking forward to that

172.8 --> 177.76000000000002

gonna join the flat earth debates

182.319 --> 189.51899999999998
right as it starts the live show i might

186.56 --> 190.0
join in at the end of the live show or

189.519 --> 192.239
maybe

190.0 --> 195.44
just in the after show depends on how

192.239 --> 195.44
much time is going to take

195.92 --> 201.11999999999998
but i'm glad that i do because there are

198.4 --> 204.31900000000002
a lot of things that i

201.12 --> 204.72
want to have worked out so i'll be doing

204.319 --> 207.2
that

204.72 --> 207.76
right after the show pretty much 50

207.2 --> 210.879
minutes

207.76 --> 214.959
past three and for now

210.879 --> 214.959
there's just a two hour live show

224.84 --> 232.879
soon

226.959 --> 232.879
all right let's get the notes

234.959 --> 240.72
yeah i've been a lot on 24 7 discord

238.84 --> 243.92000000000002
recently

240.72 --> 246.48
hey follow on buchanan good afternoon to

243.92 --> 246.48
you as well

248.48 --> 253.599
right so yesterday i started 24 7

251.519 --> 256.079
discord before the flat earth

253.599 --> 258.88
early bird show and then afterward in

256.079 --> 262.72
the evening i also went back at it again

258.88 --> 264.88
i don't know just been pulled into there

262.72 --> 266.84000000000003
some interesting conversations going on

264.88 --> 269.759
at times

266.84 --> 272.15999999999997
uh hello bob

269.759 --> 272.16
eggs

280.84 --> 283.84
right

288.72 --> 293.759
what else yeah i bumped into multiple

294.84 --> 297.84
videos

301.759 --> 304.88
let me find it back

305.28 --> 311.84
right yeah yeah oh this one

308.56 --> 311.84
really stood out to me

314.479 --> 319.68
it's just the uh unapologetic nature of

317.68 --> 322.0
the entire interview

319.68 --> 324.56
is school by dracula i'm sure yeah he

322.0 --> 328.0
did make it but he reposted it

324.56 --> 331.12
like this interview online

328.0 --> 334.72
between amanda valmer

331.12 --> 338.8
and dean clifford this is real

334.72 --> 342.8
it's pretty heavy stuff but

338.8 --> 345.039
yeah gives a whole new view on it

342.8 --> 346.08
it's it gave me a bit of a baritaria

345.039 --> 348.8
feeling

346.08 --> 350.4
but different still and it's just

348.8 --> 354.40000000000003
emphasized so much that

350.4 --> 357.44
it's all about the willingness to learn

354.4 --> 360.15999999999997
and to get real but on a

357.44 --> 361.52
very serious level so was very impressed

360.16 --> 364.08000000000004
by that

361.52 --> 364.639
i'm gonna post the link so you guys can

364.08 --> 368.88
take it

364.639 --> 370.88
look at that also subscribe to scuba

368.88 --> 373.199
dracula

370.88 --> 376.0
he's yeah he's a flat earther but he

373.199 --> 378.639
seems to be very

376.0 --> 380.8
entangled right now with this sort of

378.639 --> 383.52
thing in protests and all that

380.8 --> 387.84000000000003
it's a really good guy i met him during

383.52 --> 387.84
the amsterdam conference in 1990

391.199 --> 397.68
very awesome guy uh

394.4 --> 400.4
so subscribe to him that

397.68 --> 400.40000000000003
that happened

402.08 --> 409.84
let's see what else

414.0 --> 418.479
all right yeah yeah we were talking a

415.759 --> 421.599
bit about weather modification

418.479 --> 422.0
well lots of that popped back up it's

421.599 --> 424.8
just

422.0 --> 425.52
many there's so many articles but not

424.8 --> 427.91900000000004
all of them

425.52 --> 429.039
really stand out it's not like i'm just

427.919 --> 431.28
going to point you at

429.039 --> 433.199
all the articles but sometimes something

431.28 --> 437.84
does stand out for multiple reasons and

433.199 --> 441.039
this was one of them from rt

437.84 --> 441.44
about how nasa actually just admittedly

441.039 --> 444.0
has

441.44 --> 446.71999999999997
engaged in weather modification

444.0 --> 446.72
experiments

446.96 --> 450.15999999999997
so yeah we were talking about that on

449.12 --> 452.88
the show yesterday

450.16 --> 453.68
somebody brought it up i addressed it

452.88 --> 455.919
and so

453.68 --> 458.96
yeah then this pops up in the news that

455.919 --> 458.96
was kind of interesting

461.68 --> 466.56
to take a look at that in reflection

468.479 --> 479.84
right yeah this morning i was also again

472.16 --> 479.84000000000003
24 7 discord

486.24 --> 492.96000000000004
mostly dealing with yeah a

489.84 --> 495.11999999999995
a young person baller

492.96 --> 496.15999999999997
was just having a lot of triggering

495.12 --> 498.24
issues

496.16 --> 499.84000000000003
so he was really like goofing around and

498.24 --> 502.319
[ __ ] and

499.84 --> 505.44
getting pretty offensive at times

502.319 --> 507.12
because he was just blatantly triggered

505.44 --> 510.96
and it was interesting to see how the

507.12 --> 510.96
others were kind of dealing with it

515.12 --> 518.5600000000001
all right by the way yeah on 24 7

517.2 --> 521.839
discord yesterday

518.56 --> 524.959
i had more moments where i was

521.839 --> 528.32
getting compliments from

524.959 --> 529.92
people it's yeah it's kind of weird

528.32 --> 532.32
i'm not used to that sort of thing

529.92 --> 532.959
happening so so regularly all of a

532.32 --> 535.839
sudden

532.959 --> 535.8389999999999
but it's cool

540.72 --> 545.519
i appreciate that i'm being appreciated

543.68 --> 547.5999999999999
then at least i feel i'm not doing it

545.519 --> 551.839
all for nothing that i'm not just

547.6 --> 551.839
throwing pearls in front of swines

554.88 --> 560.399
right fiolan buchanan yeah it's very

560.839 --> 566.399
intense and revealing also

563.36 --> 570.16
just pointing at a couple of like

566.399 --> 570.16
judicial mechanics and all that

570.32 --> 573.36
so it there will be some things that

572.959 --> 575.76
will

573.36 --> 577.92
kind of like shock you because he was

575.76 --> 579.6
for example very against the idea of

577.92 --> 582.64
sovereignty

579.6 --> 586.16
because of the integral implications

582.64 --> 588.64
and he like he was really good at

586.16 --> 591.12
explaining the structure very effective

588.64 --> 593.1999999999999
at it was very impressed

591.12 --> 595.519
so he has a lot to say in those two

593.2 --> 595.519
hours

602.839 --> 605.839
right

611.519 --> 616.0
so went to bed early again one o'clock

617.6 --> 620.9590000000001
but i have but yeah i have i have

619.839 --> 624.6400000000001
restless nights

620.959 --> 628.2399999999999
still and

624.64 --> 628.24
i know i spent that time

629.6 --> 633.839
basically planning a way out

635.92 --> 642.4799999999999
i'll see where this goes keeping all the

639.68 --> 642.4799999999999
options open

643.6 --> 646.88
and hey if the gti thing works out i'll

646.32 --> 650.8000000000001
have

646.88 --> 653.6
a lot more maneuvering room to choose

650.8 --> 656.4799999999999
and i in a way i'm looking forward to

653.6 --> 659.9200000000001
that to finally

656.48 --> 662.0790000000001
not be stuck with just very little

659.92 --> 665.68
options

662.079 --> 668.7199999999999
but we'll see it's still in

665.68 --> 670.0
it's still processing right so any of

668.72 --> 674.0
you

670.0 --> 675.76
in chat want me to talk about anything

674.0 --> 678.64
specific or you want to bring something

675.76 --> 678.64
to my attention

678.72 --> 685.12
maybe there's some people having a bit

680.56 --> 685.1199999999999
of trouble waking up on a monday morning

685.279 --> 688.64
that's okay as well i'll try to find a

687.68 --> 691.279
way to fill

688.64 --> 691.279
fill the time

700.399 --> 707.44
right a funny thing is like

704.8 --> 709.1999999999999
about talking and explaining things and

707.44 --> 711.0400000000001
doing a show and presenting

709.2 --> 712.72
i've been paying more and more attention

711.04 --> 716.16
to that in general

712.72 --> 717.44
so i especially focus i'm not going to

716.16 --> 720.639
bother them with it

717.44 --> 723.6
focus on people and how they typically

720.639 --> 724.5600000000001
verbally get stuck get ticks or get

723.6 --> 728.639
screwed up

724.56 --> 728.6389999999999
and i try to also size of why

728.959 --> 737.3599999999999
and i'm getting a better

732.16 --> 739.92
idea of how that works and the same time

737.36 --> 742.32
as i'm thinking about those things more

739.92 --> 746.0
i focus also more on how can i

742.32 --> 748.24
improve myself prevent hiccups prevent

746.0 --> 751.839
stop words

748.24 --> 753.76
because i believe that i have more room

751.839 --> 757.2
for improvement in that

753.76 --> 758.0
i size myself up as potentially in the

757.2 --> 761.44
end

758.0 --> 763.04
becoming a really good stable

761.44 --> 765.839
effective speaker it's kind of what i

763.04 --> 769.4399999999999
want right

765.839 --> 771.9200000000001
that helps that i i actually want it

769.44 --> 772.8000000000001
i i really care about it on a personal

771.92 --> 776.24
level

772.8 --> 779.4399999999999
so that helps me to maintain that

776.24 --> 781.92
condensed focus and really foreseeing

779.44 --> 783.9200000000001
like where am i going to improve and how

781.92 --> 784.88
how what are the steps to get real with

783.92 --> 786.4799999999999
it

784.88 --> 788.959
right because you can have ideas and

786.48 --> 790.72
dreams about all kinds of things

788.959 --> 792.16
but then when you're actually trying to

790.72 --> 794.32
make it real engage

792.16 --> 795.8389999999999
it all falters and it falls apart and

794.32 --> 797.6800000000001
you can't find the connections you can't

795.839 --> 798.8800000000001
find a way in and other people don't

797.68 --> 800.88
understand

798.88 --> 802.639
that's a problem and it's a probably a

800.88 --> 804.0
problem for a whole lot of people in

802.639 --> 807.2
this world

804.0 --> 812.0
in a world where you're saturated

807.2 --> 814.639
with media and all that media

812.0 --> 815.519
is keeping you busy and handing you

814.639 --> 819.6
ideas and

815.519 --> 821.92
feelings and it's not always that

819.6 --> 823.12
productive for when you actually want to

821.92 --> 824.7199999999999
build yourself

823.12 --> 827.36
it's a bit of a problem you can get

824.72 --> 827.36
stuck in it

827.519 --> 831.76
right so to focus

832.56 --> 838.7199999999999
more on productive

836.079 --> 840.2399999999999
elements that you can reflect on with

838.72 --> 842.72
your own development

840.24 --> 844.72
and then you got to take it serious and

842.72 --> 848.399
then suddenly instead of

844.72 --> 851.6800000000001
sinking into other people's media

848.399 --> 854.639
and basically losing yourself in it

851.68 --> 854.6389999999999
you're studying it

854.959 --> 858.0
and this is also what i've been doing

856.88 --> 862.079
overall with the whole

858.0 --> 865.44
infowars media group

862.079 --> 868.8
alex jones and his crew because

865.44 --> 870.0790000000001
they also i feel and i have sized up

868.8 --> 872.959
over the years

870.079 --> 873.5999999999999
are taking things very serious and then

872.959 --> 876.88
there's like

873.6 --> 880.639
visible to me palpable

876.88 --> 881.04
like sort of like new things they try

880.639 --> 883.279
out

881.04 --> 886.0
in the communication and all that like

883.279 --> 890.399
there's just certainly transitions

886.0 --> 892.56
it's fascinating and i have this luxury

890.399 --> 895.279
that it's actually stands out to me

892.56 --> 895.279
because i

895.44 --> 899.2790000000001
stepped kind of a way of really sinking

898.079 --> 902.56
into it

899.279 --> 906.16
a long a long time ago already but

902.56 --> 907.8389999999999
still then ended up appreciating

906.16 --> 909.4399999999999
the quality of certain type of

907.839 --> 913.12
information and also

909.44 --> 916.399
kind of the first effect because they

913.12 --> 917.68
definitely try to hang on to that really

916.399 --> 921.04
being

917.68 --> 923.5999999999999
the first one to present

921.04 --> 924.639
a prediction of how it's going to unroll

923.6 --> 926.72
whatever is going to

924.639 --> 930.16
happen because of documents and all

926.72 --> 932.0
that's right but sometimes there's also

930.16 --> 934.16
turns out a little improvisation here

932.0 --> 937.04
and there but yeah

934.16 --> 938.7199999999999
a lot of the times it does work out it's

937.04 --> 940.3199999999999
just a fascinating thing for me it

938.72 --> 944.24
remains fascinating and i

940.32 --> 945.9200000000001
yeah i do appreciate infowars still for

944.24 --> 948.48
different types of reasons including

945.92 --> 952.639
comedic but also just for the

948.48 --> 955.6800000000001
for drama because sometimes alex get

952.639 --> 958.24
really worked up

955.68 --> 959.279
and then it's like a weird in between of

958.24 --> 961.36
like he knows

959.279 --> 962.32
he's getting worked up and he knows that

961.36 --> 966.399
that can be

962.32 --> 968.399
a thing and at the same time it is real

966.399 --> 969.6
as he's experienced it's just

968.399 --> 972.88
fascinating for me

969.6 --> 972.88
now more than ever

975.68 --> 979.519
and yeah a lot of these things he's

977.759 --> 982.0
passionate about

979.519 --> 984.399
i feel the same and probably not the

982.0 --> 987.44
only one and that's probably why it

984.399 --> 990.959
has this polarizing

987.44 --> 990.9590000000001
but popular effect

994.88 --> 998.8
right so that's my analysis of that

1000.16 --> 1011.8389999999999
hello tom parker good to see you

1016.88 --> 1024.16
oh yeah also adam meekin

1020.24 --> 1027.919
showed me like we're working on a like a

1024.16 --> 1031.039
new layout for the show

1027.919 --> 1031.439
which in a way is almost like but i just

1031.039 --> 1033.52
got

1031.439 --> 1034.959
kind of used to the old format again and

1033.52 --> 1038.16
i kind of appreciate it

1034.959 --> 1042.16
myself but seriously he's got some

1038.16 --> 1045.52
really awesome updates

1042.16 --> 1048.3190000000002
like if you thought that the or the

1045.52 --> 1050.24
previous early bird format was pretty

1048.319 --> 1053.12
pretty cool and decent looking

1050.24 --> 1055.919
well this new stuff i got together it's

1053.12 --> 1059.36
incredible it's really the next level

1055.919 --> 1062.5590000000002
so thank you adam meekin for

1059.36 --> 1065.4399999999998
well literally donating your time to to

1062.559 --> 1067.52
work on that i seriously appreciate that

1065.44 --> 1069.3600000000001
i couldn't do it myself i don't know how

1067.52 --> 1072.72
you find this stuff

1069.36 --> 1073.1999999999998
what you do yeah madame meekin is the

1072.72 --> 1076.24
bomb

1073.2 --> 1078.32
indeed so

1076.24 --> 1080.08
yeah i don't know when exactly i'm going

1078.32 --> 1083.2
to start

1080.08 --> 1084.799
using the new form it's also about some

1083.2 --> 1086.4
download issues because there's some

1084.799 --> 1089.679
really big video

1086.4 --> 1092.8400000000001
clips in there as a standard so there's

1089.679 --> 1107.99
been yeah there's some transfer

1092.84 --> 1111.079
issues but we'll work it out

1107.99 --> 1111.079
[Applause]

1113.76 --> 1117.12
so yeah the early bird show might get a

1115.919 --> 1119.3600000000001
uh

1117.12 --> 1121.28
a new look somewhere in the i don't know

1119.36 --> 1124.32
maybe next week

1121.28 --> 1125.36
or maybe i'll be too distracted by the

1124.32 --> 1126.96
new developments

1125.36 --> 1129.36
because there is a lot of things that

1126.96 --> 1132.48
are kind of like about to unroll in the

1129.36 --> 1132.4799999999998
next month at least

1132.559 --> 1137.9189999999999
one way or the other next two months

1135.6 --> 1139.36
like who knows i might just suddenly be

1137.919 --> 1143.1200000000001
moving

1139.36 --> 1145.9189999999999
if it's actually a good place to go

1143.12 --> 1148.8799999999999
and it turns out i can afford it we're

1145.919 --> 1151.2800000000002
realizing that also that

1148.88 --> 1152.16
even just trying to size up like oh

1151.28 --> 1155.6
where can i go

1152.16 --> 1156.48
what can i move into it's always been an

1155.6 --> 1159.4399999999998
issue like but

1156.48 --> 1160.16
how much does social welfare allow me to

1159.44 --> 1163.44
basically

1160.16 --> 1164.559
have as a rent and it being survivable

1163.44 --> 1166.4
and all that

1164.559 --> 1169.6789999999999
right well if i'm certainly having an

1166.4 --> 1173.44
income through gti

1169.679 --> 1175.76
then oh my god if i remember correctly

1173.44 --> 1178.3200000000002
the range is going to open up

1175.76 --> 1179.52
like really instead of having to wait

1178.32 --> 1181.6789999999999
endlessly

1179.52 --> 1184.48
i may actually just pretty quickly get

1181.679 --> 1189.52
it and then be able to keep it

1184.48 --> 1189.52
yeah it's tumultuous

1190.84 --> 1194.72
times

1192.24 --> 1194.72
changes

1204.24 --> 1207.84
road sweeping car

1218.4 --> 1222.799
no not gti

1227.679 --> 1234.3200000000002
yeah it's a uh well

1230.799 --> 1234.8799999999999
currently it's a company that i've been

1234.32 --> 1238.559
part of

1234.88 --> 1241.2800000000002
for five years

1238.559 --> 1242.08
uh yeah through my dad who got me into

1241.28 --> 1244.1589999999999
that

1242.08 --> 1246.48
because he was seeking basically

1244.159 --> 1249.2800000000002
financial salvation

1246.48 --> 1251.52
in a durable way that's not some kind of

1249.28 --> 1254.24
a scam

1251.52 --> 1255.679
and it's worked out great so far but it

1254.24 --> 1258.08
the company itself

1255.679 --> 1261.039
is just on the verge of undergoing some

1258.08 --> 1263.9189999999999
very serious transformation

1261.039 --> 1265.919
rerouting how basically the entire thing

1263.919 --> 1268.96
flows because it's pretty elaborate

1265.919 --> 1271.3600000000001
and there's a lot of people into it and

1268.96 --> 1273.44
it deals also with cryptocurrency

1271.36 --> 1274.799
its own cryptocurrency and like sub

1273.44 --> 1277.8400000000001
crypto and

1274.799 --> 1282.24
dude it's it's his own thing

1277.84 --> 1282.24
this is so gti

1284.0 --> 1291.039
let me see if i can get a main page link

1287.919 --> 1292.88
yes i can

1291.039 --> 1294.32
and i'm allowed to i'm allowed to

1292.88 --> 1297.8400000000001
advertise but

1294.32 --> 1297.84
there's a lot of stuff happening

1299.039 --> 1303.6
it sounds promising oh yes it does sound

1301.52 --> 1307.2
promising

1303.6 --> 1308.1589999999999
does indeed it's not something you can

1307.2 --> 1310.799
just

1308.159 --> 1312.88
buy into it just like that you have to

1310.799 --> 1319.52
be part of the network

1312.88 --> 1322.64
it's basically an invite-only system

1319.52 --> 1325.12
and i'm very lucky to be part of it but

1322.64 --> 1328.96
the same time it's a lot of complicated

1325.12 --> 1328.9599999999998
stuff it gives me a headache sometimes

1330.48 --> 1333.679
but practically what i will get out of

1332.799 --> 1337.039
it will be

1333.679 --> 1340.0800000000002
reliable and it's under it's about to

1337.039 --> 1341.919
undergo a switch where

1340.08 --> 1344.1589999999999
the standard value of the base

1341.919 --> 1347.76
cryptocurrency that comes rolling out

1344.159 --> 1348.48
will be if correctly changing from

1347.76 --> 1352.24
between

1348.48 --> 1356.96
half a cent to seven cents

1352.24 --> 1356.96
towards a full euro

1358.88 --> 1364.64
so that quite a dramatic difference

1365.28 --> 1371.84
and yeah i'm not gonna

1369.52 --> 1374.24
sit yes share every single intricate

1371.84 --> 1376.6399999999999
detail about my financial

1374.24 --> 1377.679
situation like that because i'm not

1376.64 --> 1380.0800000000002
really sure about

1377.679 --> 1380.96
what it's gonna all turn out into anyway

1380.08 --> 1384.6399999999999
but it's

1380.96 --> 1384.64
it's been very promising

1385.44 --> 1390.24
everybody in there is like hundreds of

1388.159 --> 1393.2
thousands of people i think

1390.24 --> 1394.799
even if not millions they're all waiting

1393.2 --> 1397.28
on this thing to happen

1394.799 --> 1397.28
right now

1399.6 --> 1406.9599999999998
a whole new situation to be implemented

1403.919 --> 1407.76
right so if any are interested at some

1406.96 --> 1411.039
point

1407.76 --> 1414.64
i might consider you

1411.039 --> 1416.08
to become part but there's some serious

1414.64 --> 1419.3600000000001
character testing

1416.08 --> 1421.279
that needs to proceed that for me

1419.36 --> 1422.559
because if you put somebody in your

1421.279 --> 1426.88
network

1422.559 --> 1431.32
you're sort of co-responsible

1426.88 --> 1434.72
to at least inform them and if they get

1431.32 --> 1439.76
disinterested they're kind of like still

1434.72 --> 1439.76
like hey are you still working on it

1440.32 --> 1444.32
not that there's a lot of work about it

1442.88 --> 1447.3600000000001
it's just a couple of clicks

1444.32 --> 1448.1589999999999
and i don't know there's there's also

1447.36 --> 1450.799
structures

1448.159 --> 1451.44
within the within a network where

1450.799 --> 1453.44
basically

1451.44 --> 1455.8400000000001
some people just don't have the time or

1453.44 --> 1456.88
they they don't even know how to really

1455.84 --> 1460.6399999999999
use a computer

1456.88 --> 1464.24
properly so they just leave it to the

1460.64 --> 1466.7990000000002
the network person that got them in

1464.24 --> 1469.1200000000001
so managing other people's accounts

1466.799 --> 1473.279
because yeah some people

1469.12 --> 1476.7199999999998
ask that you know

1473.279 --> 1477.679
somebody's grandma or whatever well the

1476.72 --> 1480.0
real

1477.679 --> 1481.8400000000001
people that are more ambitious they

1480.0 --> 1482.4
won't have that issue of course and they

1481.84 --> 1485.1999999999998
can just

1482.4 --> 1486.4
fully build and make it's almost like a

1485.2 --> 1489.44
computer game if you

1486.4 --> 1491.919
really are good and focused and

1489.44 --> 1492.64
spend a lot of attention to it it gets

1491.919 --> 1496.5590000000002
better

1492.64 --> 1500.0
quicker like palpable

1496.559 --> 1503.12
one of the inheritor it's it's pretty

1500.0 --> 1507.12
interesting like that

1503.12 --> 1512.32
and it put a lot of work into it

1507.12 --> 1515.4399999999998
to the organizing of it all right

1512.32 --> 1517.4399999999998
so if anybody is interested at that

1515.44 --> 1519.8400000000001
then let me know preferably through

1517.44 --> 1519.8400000000001
skype

1522.48 --> 1529.84
and i'll see what i can do

1559.84 --> 1565.4399999999998
do i still have you on skype tom parker

1562.4 --> 1565.44
i don't know if i do

1566.0 --> 1571.84
i think i blocked you at some point

1572.0 --> 1575.36
so you were getting kind of

1582.84 --> 1585.84
polarized

1596.88 --> 1599.8400000000001
right

1604.32 --> 1613.84
anyway i'll be busy enough soon anyway

1614.799 --> 1623.44
okay tom parker let's see i'm i'll

1618.4 --> 1623.44
get into my skype and and block you

1624.159 --> 1627.8400000000001
i think that's okay

1643.919 --> 1649.76
i think i did wait what was your address

1650.72 --> 1655.84
i don't see you in there

1665.279 --> 1669.84
i don't think i did did you block me

1675.2 --> 1680.0800000000002
anyway hey hello aries 106. good to see

1680.84 --> 1683.84
you

1692.559 --> 1696.32
okay tom parker i can't find you in my

1694.64 --> 1699.279
blog list

1696.32 --> 1699.279
ah there you are

1701.19 --> 1706.799
[Music]

1702.399 --> 1706.799
so you just lost me in the traffic did

1708.84 --> 1711.84
you

1750.84 --> 1753.84
what

1770.0 --> 1773.679
right so yeah i'm unblocking a couple of

1772.64 --> 1775.8400000000001
people

1773.679 --> 1777.919
no guarantee that'll stay that way if

1775.84 --> 1779.36
something similar is gonna come out i'll

1777.919 --> 1783.3600000000001
just do it all over again

1779.36 --> 1786.4799999999998
right because i am not here

1783.36 --> 1786.4799999999998
for people to

1786.799 --> 1790.1589999999999
basically get out of control and then

1789.44 --> 1792.72
just

1790.159 --> 1793.6000000000001
pile it all on i don't want to deal with

1792.72 --> 1796.96
that

1793.6 --> 1796.9599999999998
i don't have the room for that

1800.48 --> 1804.559
especially now but anyway let's not

1803.2 --> 1807.1200000000001
worry about that just yet

1804.559 --> 1809.2
i'm sure at some point in in the future

1807.12 --> 1810.8799999999999
that will happen again

1809.2 --> 1812.72
because that always comes and goes in

1810.88 --> 1815.2
waves that's just something i learned in

1812.72 --> 1819.039
the last couple of years

1815.2 --> 1819.039
myself in there included

1821.679 --> 1837.8400000000001
right so look what do you guys want to

1825.039 --> 1837.84
talk about

1843.76 --> 1850.48
did you see nathan oakley's premiere

1847.12 --> 1854.2399999999998
a little video clip it was really funny

1850.48 --> 1854.24
like a edited together clip

1863.6 --> 1870.48
oh right okay i have a remark here

1867.039 --> 1871.84
yeah there's a new bobbity video going

1870.48 --> 1875.72
around

1871.84 --> 1878.32
let's just get direct about incoherent

1875.72 --> 1881.76
electrostatical acceleration

1878.32 --> 1882.6399999999999
downward factor it's exactly the same

1881.76 --> 1886.24
thing

1882.64 --> 1886.24
it's exactly the same

1886.32 --> 1893.519
like reasoning argument as

1890.84 --> 1897.4399999999998
when

1893.519 --> 1901.279
which it gets it was versus brian

1897.44 --> 1905.679
in the uh in the ball busters

1901.279 --> 1908.399
debate that way back last year

1905.679 --> 1908.96
so it's basically the same it's the same

1908.399 --> 1911.36
except

1908.96 --> 1912.32
this time there was a really smooth

1911.36 --> 1916.4799999999998
worked out

1912.32 --> 1919.039
visual assistance with the presentation

1916.48 --> 1921.84
but it was just the same arguments and

1919.039 --> 1921.84
it's just

1923.36 --> 1927.6789999999999
yeah same issues still the same claim

1927.039 --> 1929.919
that gas

1927.679 --> 1931.519
is susceptible to magnetism again they

1929.919 --> 1934.64
put it in there it's just

1931.519 --> 1935.84
god how many times you want to insert

1934.64 --> 1938.72
the same fallacy

1935.84 --> 1941.279
over and over again just because it fits

1938.72 --> 1941.279
your claim

1941.76 --> 1946.08
it's getting kind of embarrassing but

1944.24 --> 1949.36
they do what they do

1946.08 --> 1951.6789999999999
the video has been reposted

1949.36 --> 1954.32
because that's what they want and that's

1951.679 --> 1954.3200000000002
what they get

1955.2 --> 1960.0800000000002
so that also happened i think i truly

1958.399 --> 1964.8799999999999
got like every event now

1960.08 --> 1964.8799999999999
that happened since last early bird show

1972.399 --> 1978.6399999999999
did i mention trump at cpac

1976.08 --> 1978.6399999999999
watch that

1980.799 --> 1985.12
and it was all fine until he started

1983.6 --> 1988.24
ramming the vag

1985.12 --> 1991.5189999999998
he was literally bragging

1988.24 --> 1994.48
about how quick he was with the vaccine

1991.519 --> 1994.48
seriously just

1998.159 --> 2004.3200000000002
and i think that even the audience was

2001.279 --> 2005.679
like really annoyed by it at times he

2004.32 --> 2008.48
got a couple of boos

2005.679 --> 2009.279
and that's from like his fans basically

2008.48 --> 2012.48
so

2009.279 --> 2019.84
that was weird to watch that did anybody

2012.48 --> 2019.84
else see that

2024.24 --> 2028.72
all right but it it's just my original

2026.48 --> 2031.1200000000001
suspicions is kind of correct like

2028.72 --> 2033.3600000000001
trump just wanted in the swamp and he's

2031.12 --> 2036.399
rooted down and he's rooted down in the

2033.36 --> 2038.8799999999999
republican region this means he's going

2036.399 --> 2042.2399999999998
to absorb a lot of gay

2038.88 --> 2042.24
that's the thing there now

2043.039 --> 2046.08
so he had to play the ymca song of

2045.679 --> 2049.04
course

2046.08 --> 2050.879
at the exit it just that's his thing now

2049.04 --> 2053.04
yeah that that's trump's thing

2050.879 --> 2055.839
it's his thing now that's what he

2053.04 --> 2055.839
chooses to do

2057.839 --> 2064.24
right so yeah when you set root in a

2061.839 --> 2066.48
swamp you're going to absorb

2064.24 --> 2068.879
the toxins of whatever is present in

2066.48 --> 2072.8
that region of the swamp

2068.879 --> 2075.5989999999997
and whatever he's gonna do with that all

2072.8 --> 2076.0
that's another matter you know might

2075.599 --> 2078.48
still

2076.0 --> 2080.48
come some good out of it it's just not

2078.48 --> 2085.52
that

2080.48 --> 2087.44
the the real idea of just the

2085.52 --> 2088.96
well make america great again it's not

2087.44 --> 2091.919
that that's not what it is

2088.96 --> 2093.76
it's more like oh safe politics it

2091.919 --> 2096.56
really all felt more like we're trying

2093.76 --> 2099.119
to save this political system

2096.56 --> 2100.88
that's what i got from him that's what i

2099.119 --> 2103.2000000000003
felt

2100.88 --> 2104.0
it's not me projecting anything onto him

2103.2 --> 2107.7599999999998
because hey

2104.0 --> 2111.44
i am kind of on his side like

2107.76 --> 2113.44
if you have to pick between it yeah

2111.44 --> 2115.359
definitely more on his side but yeah

2113.44 --> 2116.64
there's so much garbage is also coming

2115.359 --> 2120.7999999999997
out of him

2116.64 --> 2123.839
even most of his own side just really

2120.8 --> 2123.8390000000004
doesn't like it all

2128.16 --> 2131.839
but anyway that happened

2132.72 --> 2135.52
any comments

2136.24 --> 2140.3999999999996
anything anybody out there

2142.96 --> 2148.0
see there's 25 people watching

2146.4 --> 2150.88
so there should be more people around

2148.0 --> 2154.0
than just tom parker and aries 106.

2150.88 --> 2154.0
foul and buchanan

2155.119 --> 2159.839
bob axe i don't know who that is but

2173.76 --> 2181.44
oh hello arborist of steel

2178.32 --> 2187.839
just got here that's okay hello agm

2181.44 --> 2187.839
cargo apple

2195.92 --> 2201.839
left right paradigm yeah that's that's

2198.64 --> 2201.839
the basic gist of it

2212.839 --> 2215.839
indeed

2218.8 --> 2223.6800000000003
he got the fact did he get the vaccine

2221.76 --> 2228.32
cow apple i don't know if he got

2223.68 --> 2231.44
the vaccine i don't know if he did

2228.32 --> 2233.28
i know he had some kind of super special

2231.44 --> 2236.0
treatment

2233.28 --> 2236.6400000000003
some revolutionary new experimental

2236.0 --> 2239.119
thing

2236.64 --> 2240.72
which is kind of bizarre they would just

2239.119 --> 2242.88
do that

2240.72 --> 2244.3999999999996
and he did it to obviously to promote

2242.88 --> 2248.56
the medical industry

2244.4 --> 2251.359
like he wanted he wants that for america

2248.56 --> 2253.52
i really wonder if he understands like

2251.359 --> 2254.24
how corrupted the medical system really

2253.52 --> 2257.359
is

2254.24 --> 2259.839
if he actually understands that

2257.359 --> 2261.839
and if he does if he cares about it or

2259.839 --> 2264.0
if it's just the money is too good the

2261.839 --> 2268.32
business appeal is too

2264.0 --> 2268.32
important for him to let go or something

2268.72 --> 2274.7999999999997
maybe he's gotten stuck and now medical

2272.56 --> 2276.96
industrial complex is the only way out

2274.8 --> 2278.32
that he can see for his own business

2276.96 --> 2281.359
future

2278.32 --> 2281.3590000000004
don't know

2283.52 --> 2286.4
i don't know

2296.839 --> 2299.839
didn't

2338.839 --> 2341.839
hmm

2380.839 --> 2383.839
somebody

2420.56 --> 2425.839
worked with monsev slowly

2426.92 --> 2439.839
bioelectrics okay i didn't know that

2440.96 --> 2444.48
right makes sense

2450.4 --> 2454.96
the hell ares 106 that's ridiculous

2457.2 --> 2467.839
so what

2478.839 --> 2481.839
so

2507.839 --> 2515.359
okay so any other questions

2511.28 --> 2517.52
this is it it's not that i really like

2515.359 --> 2519.52
want to talk about politics it's just

2517.52 --> 2522.0
that i have been

2519.52 --> 2524.24
still looking at things and just being

2522.0 --> 2527.68
honest about it

2524.24 --> 2529.7599999999998
just to keep track like

2527.68 --> 2531.68
when i figured out about flat earth and

2529.76 --> 2535.44
i figured out that

2531.68 --> 2537.04
like the left right paradigm and beyond

2535.44 --> 2539.119
that didn't mean that i'm just going to

2537.04 --> 2540.48
like throw it all in the trash can

2539.119 --> 2542.4
immediately because

2540.48 --> 2544.72
i know it's still going to have

2542.4 --> 2546.48
influence on a lot of people

2544.72 --> 2551.839
and it's kind of important to me to

2546.48 --> 2551.839
understand that influence

2554.64 --> 2559.1189999999997
but that doesn't mean that i'm like

2556.24 --> 2562.8799999999997
constantly thinking about that now on

2559.119 --> 2567.839
average i think i think about more

2562.88 --> 2570.8
personal life situations and flat earth

2567.839 --> 2572.24
conceptions and cosmogeny because

2570.8 --> 2576.079
there's still so much

2572.24 --> 2576.0789999999997
unexplored possibilities

2576.56 --> 2579.839
even virtually

2603.76 --> 2610.7200000000003
yeah that that's right

2607.68 --> 2610.72
there is 106.

2610.96 --> 2613.92
hey indifference

2615.76 --> 2621.6800000000003
yeah now trump making space force was

2618.319 --> 2623.92
definitely not a popular move

2621.68 --> 2635.839
from the flat earthers for the flat

2623.92 --> 2635.839
earthers that's right

2636.72 --> 2639.839
but i i don't even understand what it's

2639.359 --> 2649.839
really

2639.839 --> 2649.839
even trying to achieve

2660.56 --> 2677.839
no i don't i'm not familiar with fritz

2664.079 --> 2677.8390000000004
springmeier 13 families what

2705.92 --> 2719.839
why do you ask

2722.88 --> 2727.92
plot lines of the illuminati oh sure

2730.839 --> 2733.839
whatever

2768.16 --> 2770.48
hmm

2772.079 --> 2776.5600000000004
air force community didn't like that

2774.079 --> 2779.599
either a lot of their funding for

2776.56 --> 2779.599
space stuff

2780.56 --> 2785.2799999999997
they had funding for space stuff did

2783.04 --> 2785.2799999999997
they

2786.24 --> 2803.839
how does that work what do you mean

2804.56 --> 2808.7999999999997
right yes yeah i heard that

2814.96 --> 2831.839
they do seem to have like this bloodline

2817.119 --> 2831.839
thing going for them

2900.16 --> 2906.48
right well yeah space force

2903.2 --> 2910.72
what else can it be what could be

2906.48 --> 2913.2
like a a development project as well or

2910.72 --> 2914.0299999999997
i kind of suspected early on that space

2913.2 --> 2915.68
force would be

2914.03 --> 2921.2000000000003
[Music]

2915.68 --> 2924.8799999999997
more about information technology

2921.2 --> 2926.7999999999997
and about yeah like

2924.88 --> 2929.28
it's basically social engineering

2926.8 --> 2932.0
related things and how to

2929.28 --> 2933.6800000000003
i guess reinforce the idea of space and

2932.0 --> 2937.52
that it's real

2933.68 --> 2940.0
maybe it was kind of sum it up

2937.52 --> 2944.24
to give a foundation for some people

2940.0 --> 2949.599
more actively trying to counter

2944.24 --> 2952.72
global skeptics i don't know exactly

2949.599 --> 2955.44
what they do space force

2952.72 --> 2957.2
but i suspected that it might be more

2955.44 --> 2971.839
social media related than

2957.2 --> 2971.839
actual aeronautics and all that

2982.839 --> 2985.839
what

2992.319 --> 2999.2
what the mind like how

2995.92 --> 3003.599
how exactly

2999.2 --> 3006.24
or are you just giving a more esoteric

3003.599 --> 3007.599
biblical explanation to basically what i

3006.24 --> 3009.359
described

3007.599 --> 3013.839
it when i described it in a more

3009.359 --> 3013.839
technical sense

3018.0 --> 3021.839
that's information control social

3019.92 --> 3026.0
engineering yeah if you've

3021.839 --> 3029.52
conceived that christ returns through us

3026.0 --> 3032.88
the truth figuring out the schemes

3029.52 --> 3035.119
then yeah in that sense

3032.88 --> 3035.119
you're

3039.44 --> 3043.28
he correct in ufos

3052.839 --> 3055.839
what

3066.8 --> 3083.8390000000004
military satellites what are that what

3069.44 --> 3083.839
is that

3096.319 --> 3098.64
hmm

3101.119 --> 3104.4
coming with clouds

3106.16 --> 3111.839
oh goody

3116.48 --> 3125.839
i i don't see how coming with clouds

3120.4 --> 3125.839
equates ufos i really don't

3126.4 --> 3130.319
unless you're forwarding a title of a

3129.44 --> 3139.839
book

3130.319 --> 3139.839
that i don't know about

3140.24 --> 3146.24
i was pretty certain that when christ

3142.559 --> 3149.6800000000003
returns it's actually unmistakable

3146.24 --> 3149.68
that's what i got out of it

3150.0 --> 3153.119
so i don't i really don't understand why

3152.48 --> 3155.359
you say

3153.119 --> 3156.8
he comes back through ufos that just

3155.359 --> 3167.839
seems

3156.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
like a bizarre thing to say

3173.599 --> 3177.839
all right the charader we within the

3175.44 --> 3184.079
wheel d has a name

3177.839 --> 3184.0789999999997
but yeah that's how is that a ufo

3184.64 --> 3189.5989999999997
because thus there's even been like

3186.88 --> 3192.8
paintings of that

3189.599 --> 3195.839
that doesn't look like what we see out

3192.8 --> 3195.8390000000004
there as a ufo

3196.0 --> 3209.839
that doesn't look like that at all

3210.559 --> 3217.119
oh my god mind i got shut up

3213.76 --> 3219.5200000000004
seriously shut the hell up now

3217.119 --> 3221.2000000000003
this is getting really annoying you're

3219.52 --> 3223.92
you're entering a train of thought that

3221.2 --> 3226.0789999999997
is seriously border psychosis it's

3223.92 --> 3228.2400000000002
absolute [ __ ]

3226.079 --> 3230.8
you're not gonna equate the return of

3228.24 --> 3234.319
christ with freaking independence day

3230.8 --> 3236.7200000000003
movie okay it's the worst [ __ ] i've

3234.319 --> 3239.599
ever heard

3236.72 --> 3240.72
that happens how the hell can you say

3239.599 --> 3244.2400000000002
that's christ

3240.72 --> 3245.68
that's ridiculous you obviously don't

3244.24 --> 3247.52
understand what christ

3245.68 --> 3251.839
is if you're gonna say something like

3247.52 --> 3251.839
that in the first place

3282.0 --> 3292.079
yeah i really don't know where

3285.92 --> 3295.28
yeah where you got that from

3292.079 --> 3307.3590000000004
it makes no sense whatsoever it's very

3295.28 --> 3310.6400000000003
sloppy of you

3307.359 --> 3314.48
what do i think ufo sightings are

3310.64 --> 3314.48
i don't know exactly what they are

3314.96 --> 3321.92
government i doubt it

3319.28 --> 3323.52
not as in the literal reigning

3321.92 --> 3326.16
government

3323.52 --> 3328.559
might there be secret groups having

3326.16 --> 3332.0789999999997
secret technology

3328.559 --> 3335.44
well yeah i wouldn't be surprised at all

3332.079 --> 3338.559
are they like

3335.44 --> 3341.76
beings from other realms

3338.559 --> 3344.1600000000003
next to us that's a possibility

3341.76 --> 3346.3190000000004
it's just another techno technological

3344.16 --> 3349.44
development

3346.319 --> 3350.48
is it christ like why why would you even

3349.44 --> 3363.839
think that

3350.48 --> 3363.839
it makes no sense

3364.0 --> 3369.04
ufo plasma events

3367.2 --> 3371.52
that's an interesting idea george

3369.04 --> 3371.52
sanford

3375.68 --> 3381.68
i maybe some light-based ones are

3379.359 --> 3383.359
there's all kinds of weird things going

3381.68 --> 3386.3999999999996
on in this world the world

3383.359 --> 3391.2
is freaking surreal it really

3386.4 --> 3393.76
really is

3391.2 --> 3394.96
like what about those freaking rods rods

3393.76 --> 3398.559
that just fly at

3394.96 --> 3402.4
extreme speed just nothing

3398.559 --> 3402.4
it's like you see it

3402.96 --> 3407.839
but it's literally non-physical or it's

3405.92 --> 3408.7200000000003
in another frequency but you can still

3407.839 --> 3411.2
see it

3408.72 --> 3413.4399999999996
if that happens what you're going to say

3411.2 --> 3419.1189999999997
that is christ christ is a tube just

3413.44 --> 3433.839
hopping around

3419.119 --> 3433.839
it's really weird what you're doing

3472.839 --> 3475.839
um

3482.4 --> 3486.0
all right go apple well maybe this the

3485.28 --> 3489.119
thule and

3486.0 --> 3491.28
frail society do have

3489.119 --> 3494.7200000000003
an understanding with this technology

3491.28 --> 3498.2400000000002
but i've also heard through my own

3494.72 --> 3502.24
occultist research including with ufos

3498.24 --> 3506.16
that there's actually ways that you can

3502.24 --> 3510.3999999999996
kind of like use your own mind to create

3506.16 --> 3512.3999999999996
a ufo that's actually a spiritual

3510.4 --> 3514.2400000000002
construct that you can interface i've

3512.4 --> 3518.079
never personally done it

3514.24 --> 3520.8799999999997
consciously that is but i've heard

3518.079 --> 3520.88
it's out there

3522.24 --> 3526.319
it was very bizarre to me that i heard

3524.4 --> 3531.839
when i heard it

3526.319 --> 3531.839
it's kind of scary

3534.72 --> 3545.839
but it is going out in there so

3537.839 --> 3545.839
it's just

3590.319 --> 3594.0
a really clutch fair when did that

3593.359 --> 3596.64
happen

3594.0 --> 3598.88
exactly when are these supposed thousand

3596.64 --> 3600.16
years of peace

3598.88 --> 3603.44
there must have been a couple of

3600.16 --> 3603.44
thousand years ago then

3605.52 --> 3611.28
i don't what thousand years of peace

3608.559 --> 3613.44
where in history was this exactly oh

3611.28 --> 3616.1600000000003
wait there is no history of a thousand

3613.44 --> 3616.16
years of peace

3626.839 --> 3629.839
hmm

3640.72 --> 3647.2799999999997
oh my god how would you know you're just

3644.0 --> 3650.48
stating things as if they are facts

3647.28 --> 3655.0400000000004
right never considered that god doesn't

3650.48 --> 3659.76
do such things it's the design

3655.04 --> 3662.5589999999997
that makes people do it to themselves

3659.76 --> 3664.079
ever considered that are you just stuck

3662.559 --> 3666.3190000000004
on this specific

3664.079 --> 3671.8390000000004
mechanical interpretation are you stuck

3666.319 --> 3671.839
in esoterics

3690.64 --> 3694.799
okay earth larp dumpster fire yeah

3693.44 --> 3696.4
that's a funny one

3694.799 --> 3698.88
thousands year of peace just started

3696.4 --> 3702.88
because big bear started barteria

3698.88 --> 3707.359
and homesteading now it's a

3702.88 --> 3713.839
i think that's a good dream no

3707.359 --> 3713.839
why not

3716.64 --> 3721.1189999999997
do i wish i had fewer crazies in my

3719.2 --> 3725.1189999999997
audience

3721.119 --> 3727.039
well it's the crazies that are the

3725.119 --> 3728.4
have the least objective to make

3727.039 --> 3731.76
themselves heard

3728.4 --> 3734.079
on average but i don't think i

3731.76 --> 3736.559
have yet there's a lot of people that

3734.079 --> 3739.28
are just listening

3736.559 --> 3740.1600000000003
and that at some point i just get

3739.28 --> 3741.52
comments from

3740.16 --> 3743.2799999999997
and i didn't even know it's like yeah

3741.52 --> 3743.839
i've been following your show for like

3743.28 --> 3746.96
three years

3743.839 --> 3748.88
like what holy [ __ ] there's people out

3746.96 --> 3750.079
there that are following me for years

3748.88 --> 3753.599
and i never even

3750.079 --> 3753.599
knew they were there so

3753.68 --> 3758.5589999999997
i don't think the majority of my

3755.52 --> 3760.48
audience are crazies

3758.559 --> 3763.3590000000004
i do think that the majority of my

3760.48 --> 3763.359
audience have

3763.76 --> 3771.3590000000004
realized crazies are out there though

3769.68 --> 3783.839
and just like we are trying to find a

3771.359 --> 3783.839
way to deal with it

3803.28 --> 3807.6800000000003
the more v o a what

3808.839 --> 3813.68
what

3810.079 --> 3813.6800000000003
cutting some getting some keyboard

3822.839 --> 3825.839
problems

3833.119 --> 3839.839
okay this is interesting

3846.4 --> 3849.839
what do you think minor god where are

3848.319 --> 3853.839
you at humming

3849.839 --> 3853.839
agm's got a good point

3861.28 --> 3864.559
i mean you seem to be in a mood where

3863.76 --> 3868.96
you're suddenly

3864.559 --> 3871.119
very expert yeah experimental

3868.96 --> 3872.16
with christ and god and what it could be

3871.119 --> 3875.359
right

3872.16 --> 3876.96
but you are kind of like being a little

3875.359 --> 3880.0
bit too wild and that

3876.96 --> 3882.079
kind of enters atheism

3880.0 --> 3884.64
perspective territories well that's

3882.079 --> 3888.8390000000004
that's a little too rough

3884.64 --> 3891.7599999999998
but yeah you're kind of

3888.839 --> 3892.5589999999997
disrespecting the esoteric nature a

3891.76 --> 3894.559
little

3892.559 --> 3897.28
i think that's what people in chat are

3894.559 --> 3897.28
responding to

3897.68 --> 3902.319
because that kind of eventually enters

3899.76 --> 3904.559
the territory of blasphemy especially if

3902.319 --> 3907.2
you just start assuming

3904.559 --> 3908.3190000000004
some of these weird assumptions and then

3907.2 --> 3923.839
going with it

3908.319 --> 3923.839
just like that

3927.2 --> 3931.359
don't say that again that's not that's

3929.68 --> 3934.24
gone

3931.359 --> 3937.839
don't don't love signaling a conflict

3934.24 --> 3937.839
that's ridiculous

3939.839 --> 3943.599
but yeah these angels you're talking

3941.839 --> 3946.0
about minor god i'm pretty sure that

3943.599 --> 3948.6400000000003
they don't

3946.0 --> 3949.44
spread the gospel the angels when they

3948.64 --> 3952.799
just freaking

3949.44 --> 3955.76
show up it's usually to

3952.799 --> 3956.64
actually affect something not just to

3955.76 --> 3960.48
inform

3956.64 --> 3964.0
people right that's what i

3960.48 --> 3966.96
kind of got out of it like angels are

3964.0 --> 3969.68
actors they take action they do

3966.96 --> 3973.52
something they have a specific

3969.68 --> 3976.96
power in the whole web

3973.52 --> 3981.599
of god's power so they're an acting

3976.96 --> 3983.839
agent that's what i got out of it

3981.599 --> 3985.76
the holy spirit is the one that you can

3983.839 --> 3991.2
seek out

3985.76 --> 3994.48
to yeah get closer to god

3991.2 --> 3996.0789999999997
that's not like an angel so yeah i think

3994.48 --> 4007.839
you're simply you're just wrong

3996.079 --> 4007.8390000000004
and agm is actually right

4010.559 --> 4017.119
well dude my god if there's some literal

4014.24 --> 4018.319
apparitions of angels oh blood project

4017.119 --> 4020.48
blue beam uh

4018.319 --> 4022.5589999999997
right if there's something like that

4020.48 --> 4025.76
happening everybody's going to be like

4022.559 --> 4025.76
what the hell is going on

4030.559 --> 4035.6800000000003
so i don't know where you're getting

4032.839 --> 4038.799
this

4035.68 --> 4038.799
oh come on

4039.359 --> 4044.96
see that every time you do that every

4042.4 --> 4047.76
time you do that

4044.96 --> 4050.16
now you're being an atheist this

4047.76 --> 4053.039
literally atheist cosmology you're just

4050.16 --> 4053.0389999999998
seeping in there

4053.359 --> 4063.839
it's literally what you do

4064.0 --> 4071.28
right that that's actually called

4067.28 --> 4073.3590000000004
biblical back engineering from a

4071.28 --> 4076.4
from an atheist perspective that's

4073.359 --> 4079.5989999999997
effectively what you're engaging in here

4076.4 --> 4081.039
it's what i got the feel of it's what

4079.599 --> 4084.6400000000003
you're doing

4081.039 --> 4087.2000000000003
i wonder if you realize it

4084.64 --> 4091.0389999999998
because if you do then you are actually

4087.2 --> 4093.2799999999997
a freaking satanist

4091.039 --> 4095.5200000000004
so giving you a little warning about

4093.28 --> 4095.52
that

4102.839 --> 4120.719
now no let's not

4118.96 --> 4122.719
i think you've got some new spiritual

4120.719 --> 4126.719
dude

4122.719 --> 4128.08
to pay for the demons you got riding

4126.719 --> 4130.2390000000005
along with you and i think they're

4128.08 --> 4133.12
they're coming up again you know so yeah

4130.239 --> 4135.599999999999
you are acting

4133.12 --> 4137.2789999999995
a slightly higher percentage of

4135.6 --> 4139.279
possessed

4137.279 --> 4142.2390000000005
let me just say it like that and i do

4139.279 --> 4145.92
not appreciate it

4142.239 --> 4147.199
stop trying to back engineer the bible

4145.92 --> 4150.88
through an atheist

4147.199 --> 4153.599999999999
lingo right with their ufos and

4150.88 --> 4154.719
alien creators and all that [ __ ] that's

4153.6 --> 4158.839
all

4154.719 --> 4161.839
being it's all back engineering all of

4158.839 --> 4161.839
it

4164.159 --> 4167.599999999999
yeah that's right

4169.92 --> 4175.839
glad you can see the fun of it because

4171.759 --> 4175.839
that's what i'm sensing here

4189.44 --> 4192.719
if you are wrong on your teaching your

4191.359 --> 4194.8
sadness no

4192.719 --> 4197.28
no no when you're wrong you're just

4194.8 --> 4199.1990000000005
wrong you're satanist

4197.28 --> 4201.199
when you actually realize what you're

4199.199 --> 4203.5199999999995
doing and still continuing it when you

4201.199 --> 4204.5599999999995
are enforcing a mistake that you know is

4203.52 --> 4206.56
a mistake

4204.56 --> 4208.56
and i just pointed out at you you're

4206.56 --> 4211.280000000001
trying to effectively back

4208.56 --> 4213.679
engineer biblical things and then

4211.28 --> 4217.199
inserting

4213.679 --> 4219.6
elements that are very atheist specific

4217.199 --> 4222.5599999999995
that tie into a whole range of back

4219.6 --> 4224.56
engineering projects

4222.56 --> 4226.56
for the entire reality including the

4224.56 --> 4229.360000000001
bible

4226.56 --> 4231.84
to make it atheist to give it another

4229.36 --> 4231.839999999999
version

4239.199 --> 4244.08
chariots which are ufo you see i'm

4242.08 --> 4247.92
pretty sure there's not

4244.08 --> 4251.36
brackets in the bible

4247.92 --> 4253.36
which are ufos yeah yeah sounds like you

4251.36 --> 4258.88
are

4253.36 --> 4260.96
actually just misquoting

4258.88 --> 4262.2390000000005
i don't think that even satanists do

4260.96 --> 4264.4
that i think they're

4262.239 --> 4266.08
too sophisticated to do that on average

4264.4 --> 4270.48
so you're just

4266.08 --> 4274.159
acting kind of demonic

4270.48 --> 4274.159
it's really weird what you're doing here

4278.88 --> 4287.36
right tiny woman like

4282.0 --> 4292.32
i ifos

4287.36 --> 4292.32
no it's just a chariot right

4297.32 --> 4315.84
ezekiel chapter one

4301.199 --> 4315.839999999999
describes ufo can you be more specific

4333.6 --> 4340.8
yeah thanks for reinforcing that thanks

4337.199 --> 4344.4
you have to read it oh really

4340.8 --> 4347.360000000001
so can't you just summarize what exactly

4344.4 --> 4348.48
you are saying ufo because i'm pretty

4347.36 --> 4351.5199999999995
damn sure

4348.48 --> 4352.32
that's that is not the terminology or

4351.52 --> 4354.88
the order

4352.32 --> 4356.639999999999
in which it is put in the freaking bible

4354.88 --> 4360.159000000001
anywhere

4356.64 --> 4364.0
right the things phenomena

4360.159 --> 4366.96
might have been described sometimes with

4364.0 --> 4370.52
maybe a visual assistance

4366.96 --> 4374.4
in the description yeah

4370.52 --> 4374.400000000001
ufo no

4381.6 --> 4387.679
we within a wheel oh well then it that

4384.96 --> 4390.159
that's immediately in the ufo of course

4387.679 --> 4390.159
right that's

4391.76 --> 4396.159000000001
so it's it's not the divine chariot

4396.56 --> 4401.04
designer specific construct

4406.48 --> 4409.919999999999
so this wheel within the wheels are

4408.239 --> 4412.4
really cool

4409.92 --> 4413.36
but i don't see it i don't see how that

4412.4 --> 4416.5599999999995
equates to

4413.36 --> 4427.839999999999
ufo sightings here on earth at all

4416.56 --> 4427.84
like not even close

4431.36 --> 4434.5599999999995
hey well if you're not gonna put it out

4433.6 --> 4436.96
right because

4434.56 --> 4437.6
if that is the thing if it is about that

4436.96 --> 4439.76
chariot

4437.6 --> 4441.280000000001
right the wheel within a wheel i know

4439.76 --> 4444.56
that part i've already heard it

4441.28 --> 4447.199
yeah i've heard out flat waters who lit

4444.56 --> 4448.96
flat water has videos where he lit shows

4447.199 --> 4452.239
the imagery

4448.96 --> 4454.32
and he actually just word by word

4452.239 --> 4455.28
talks about it so yeah i do know what

4454.32 --> 4457.679
that is i just

4455.28 --> 4458.96
i'm not a guy that knows verses or

4457.679 --> 4461.4400000000005
whatever

4458.96 --> 4463.28
i just know the esoteric content that's

4461.44 --> 4465.919999999999
the thing that i remember

4463.28 --> 4466.88
not which paragraph you can find what

4465.92 --> 4469.36
sentence

4466.88 --> 4469.92
okay so if you're talking about that

4469.36 --> 4473.12
that has

4469.92 --> 4475.52
no relation to actual ufo

4473.12 --> 4478.239
sightings out here in the world

4475.52 --> 4478.2390000000005
whatsoever

4480.84 --> 4483.84
whatsoever

4494.84 --> 4500.56
uh

4497.199 --> 4502.639999999999
right well it's not unidentified now is

4500.56 --> 4502.64
it

4504.32 --> 4508.239
how is it i yeah ufo doesn't mean

4507.04 --> 4510.96
necessarily yeah but it

4508.239 --> 4512.799999999999
that is what it does mean now tiny wombo

4510.96 --> 4513.76
i know technically that's not what it

4512.8 --> 4517.76
means

4513.76 --> 4521.360000000001
it's a purple popularized terminology

4517.76 --> 4524.2390000000005
for a long time colloquially

4521.36 --> 4525.04
that's exactly what it means to most

4524.239 --> 4528.159
people

4525.04 --> 4539.84
that read it it's exactly that

4528.159 --> 4539.839999999999
that what what it means right

4544.64 --> 4550.400000000001
so you can get all pedantic about the

4547.36 --> 4552.719
technical meaning of that word

4550.4 --> 4554.159
unidentified flag object right oh yeah

4552.719 --> 4557.36
you could call that

4554.159 --> 4557.759999999999
the chariot of god that you could call

4557.36 --> 4560.5599999999995
it

4557.76 --> 4561.76
an unidentified and yeah there's just

4560.56 --> 4563.280000000001
this one

4561.76 --> 4567.6
little issue though it's not

4563.28 --> 4570.32
unidentified it's fully described

4567.6 --> 4572.320000000001
and you know where it's coming from so

4570.32 --> 4574.48
it's not unidentified it is actually

4572.32 --> 4581.84
identified and

4574.48 --> 4581.839999999999
yeah it's a unique thing

4609.6 --> 4611.84
what

4618.32 --> 4626.88
wait you talking to me tom parker

4623.199 --> 4626.879999999999
are you actually talking to me

4629.04 --> 4633.6
are you you actually having the gall to

4632.56 --> 4637.6
order me

4633.6 --> 4640.719
to read something

4637.6 --> 4643.04
when i yeah already elaborated

4640.719 --> 4644.2390000000005
and basically gave you the details of

4643.04 --> 4646.96
how i do

4644.239 --> 4647.599999999999
know what that is referring to even i

4646.96 --> 4651.36
don't

4647.6 --> 4653.1990000000005
i don't know that specific verse right

4651.36 --> 4655.36
you better not be having an attitude to

4653.199 --> 4656.08
me because then our relationship is

4655.36 --> 4659.36
going to go

4656.08 --> 4659.36
very bad very quickly

4661.44 --> 4666.4
because you're not getting an apology

4663.04 --> 4668.88
because my point stands

4666.4 --> 4672.0
it's ridiculous to start equating that

4668.88 --> 4675.1990000000005
thing with the ufo

4672.0 --> 4677.679
because a ufo yeah that's a technical

4675.199 --> 4678.48
terminology yeah yeah but when every

4677.679 --> 4682.32
time

4678.48 --> 4683.678999999999
every time somebody says a ufo

4682.32 --> 4686.12
what do you think everybody's gonna

4683.679 --> 4689.52
think of when they hear that anybody

4686.12 --> 4690.96
anybody you know exactly what they're

4689.52 --> 4694.64
gonna think of

4690.96 --> 4696.64
so just don't use that mechanical

4694.64 --> 4698.400000000001
terminology for something that has been

4696.64 --> 4701.04
colloquial spread out

4698.4 --> 4707.839999999999
as a very specific cultural meaning just

4701.04 --> 4707.84
don't do it

4730.4 --> 4735.44
seeking star wars i disagree you might

4733.92 --> 4739.92
consider that it changes

4735.44 --> 4743.199
apparent size depending on how much

4739.92 --> 4743.1990000000005
air you're looking through

4744.4 --> 4749.839999999999
there is no actual size there's only

4746.96 --> 4749.84
angular size

4761.44 --> 4765.839999999999
that that's not gonna run tom parker i

4764.08 --> 4766.719
don't care whether it's a chapter or a

4765.84 --> 4769.4400000000005
verse

4766.719 --> 4769.76
it is an attitude that you are having to

4769.44 --> 4772.879999999999
me

4769.76 --> 4776.88
and it's something i don't accept

4772.88 --> 4779.6
right no that's your thing

4776.88 --> 4783.36
well that's cool you can have your thing

4779.6 --> 4783.360000000001
like that with that attitude somewhere

4788.84 --> 4791.84
else

4802.0 --> 4805.12
i don't need to hear the tone of your

4803.679 --> 4808.96
voice to see

4805.12 --> 4808.96
the meaning of the words that you type

4811.84 --> 4816.4800000000005
no i don't owe you an apology either my

4816.84 --> 4819.84
god

4824.56 --> 4827.76
but hey if you keep pushing me i'll ban

4826.88 --> 4830.0
you both

4827.76 --> 4831.4400000000005
before the show is over no problem at

4830.0 --> 4833.44
all

4831.44 --> 4834.638999999999
keep pushing it come on guys keep

4833.44 --> 4847.839999999999
pushing it

4834.639 --> 4847.84
sure it'll end up well

4872.32 --> 4876.88
bad you for having a bad attitude that's

4886.84 --> 4889.84
why

4892.0 --> 4903.84
all right be right back in two minutes

5010.96 --> 5015.84
hey guns have never run rmp

5025.04 --> 5031.5199999999995
how do i post a photo that's yeah you

5028.159 --> 5031.5199999999995
can't post a photo in

5031.679 --> 5037.12
in youtube chats but if you have it

5034.96 --> 5037.12
on

5038.8 --> 5044.639
if you have it behind a link

5042.239 --> 5046.799999999999
you got it somewhere on the web then you

5044.639 --> 5049.1990000000005
can post that link

5046.8 --> 5051.76
if it's not too big can't be more than

5049.199 --> 5057.839999999999
200 characters

5051.76 --> 5057.84
so you could try that

5080.4 --> 5085.839999999999
who says what

5093.84 --> 5096.88
oh my god

5096.96 --> 5101.84
right oh not interested my god not

5110.84 --> 5113.84
interested

5138.159 --> 5141.839999999999
all right

5180.84 --> 5183.84
hmm

5206.159 --> 5212.239
man it's so much colder now that the sun

5208.08 --> 5212.239
is not hitting in the room anymore

5221.04 --> 5225.84
oh god

5233.84 --> 5239.679
you amazing yeah just like last year and

5236.639 --> 5241.92
the year before and the year before that

5239.679 --> 5244.4
and all the way back to when i first

5241.92 --> 5246.639
heard of it in the 80s it was gonna come

5244.4 --> 5251.599999999999
any second now

5246.639 --> 5256.400000000001
mine got any second now any second now

5251.6 --> 5262.08
in the last 30 years yeah i know

5256.4 --> 5264.48
any second now keep on keep on focusing

5262.08 --> 5267.28
keep on focusing on that iconography in

5264.48 --> 5269.12
your mind and don't step away from it

5267.28 --> 5271.28
like why would you deal with the world

5269.12 --> 5273.36
when you could come back any second now

5271.28 --> 5276.4
christ could come back any second now

5273.36 --> 5277.199
just don't deal with the world you don't

5276.4 --> 5280.638999999999
need to because

5277.199 --> 5295.839999999999
christ can come back any second now

5280.639 --> 5295.84
right very productive

5300.639 --> 5305.6
yeah keep squirting

5303.76 --> 5308.639
that year didn't force people to get a

5305.6 --> 5310.639
vaccine oh really how would you know

5308.639 --> 5312.32
you know there's a lot of moments in

5310.639 --> 5314.8
20th century

5312.32 --> 5316.48
whereas [ __ ] like that definitely did

5314.8 --> 5319.04
happen

5316.48 --> 5319.5199999999995
where was christ then oh oh yeah you

5319.04 --> 5321.92
might

5319.52 --> 5323.76
personally actually stumble into a

5321.92 --> 5326.639
slaughterhouse period

5323.76 --> 5327.92
yeah oh if that is gonna make christ

5326.639 --> 5329.679
because it's you

5327.92 --> 5331.92
because it's you it's gonna be christ

5329.679 --> 5334.639
coming back or why did you just stop

5331.92 --> 5337.679
fantasizing about christ coming back and

5334.639 --> 5340.400000000001
actually deal with the freaking world

5337.679 --> 5340.4
how about that

5341.04 --> 5345.28
that would be a lot more productive in

5342.639 --> 5345.28
my opinion

5349.04 --> 5352.32
because i'm sure he's coming back it's

5351.36 --> 5354.5599999999995
just that

5352.32 --> 5355.759999999999
do you really know what that means i

5354.56 --> 5357.92
doubt it

5355.76 --> 5359.1990000000005
because you're constantly focusing on a

5357.92 --> 5361.12
singular

5359.199 --> 5363.759999999999
thing that is completely out of your

5361.12 --> 5366.4
power in order to distract you from that

5363.76 --> 5369.6
which is within your reach right

5366.4 --> 5371.04
and by that very thing you're doing you

5369.6 --> 5376.2390000000005
prove to me that you don't

5371.04 --> 5393.84
get it because you're wasting your focus

5376.239 --> 5393.839999999999
thinks you don't have any grip on at all

5424.239 --> 5427.839999999999
yeah i'm afraid that minor god has been

5426.56 --> 5432.88
hit by a new

5427.84 --> 5435.28
bible savage inspiration wave against

5432.88 --> 5438.96
just asserting nonsense

5435.28 --> 5442.159
his own view on it sorry this is really

5438.96 --> 5445.92
not not something that

5442.159 --> 5449.839999999999
i want to uh yeah go with you

5445.92 --> 5449.84
on that trip thank you very much

5471.92 --> 5477.84
what where are you getting that from

5480.08 --> 5484.639
are you just trolling it is a man after

5488.84 --> 5491.84
all

5496.08 --> 5502.32
right yeah thanks agm thanks for

5499.84 --> 5505.84
being on my side and this because it's

5502.32 --> 5505.84
just getting really tiresome

5515.12 --> 5519.84
here goes again

5522.56 --> 5529.1990000000005
yeah it's it's only that if you let it

5526.96 --> 5531.199
if you let it the mind of god and you

5529.199 --> 5533.28
seem to have already made up your mind

5531.199 --> 5535.759999999999
about

5533.28 --> 5537.759999999999
letting everything happen and that's why

5535.76 --> 5539.84
you're overly focused

5537.76 --> 5542.0
on this thing that is completely out of

5539.84 --> 5544.96
your grasp

5542.0 --> 5546.32
because obviously you are basically

5544.96 --> 5548.8
[ __ ] your pants

5546.32 --> 5550.719
about the world right now and you need a

5548.8 --> 5552.96
distraction so you're finding something

5550.719 --> 5555.76
that's really amazing and that you have

5552.96 --> 5556.96
absolutely no grip or say over

5555.76 --> 5559.360000000001
whatsoever

5556.96 --> 5561.52
in order to distract you from

5559.36 --> 5563.5199999999995
potentially engaging in what to you

5561.52 --> 5567.6
might be a nerve wrecking

5563.52 --> 5567.6
endeavor and that is dealing with the

5572.84 --> 5575.84
world

5585.679 --> 5589.36
and hey i don't blame you for stressing

5588.719 --> 5591.36
out

5589.36 --> 5593.199
sometimes at least about how the world

5591.36 --> 5596.799999999999
is going about

5593.199 --> 5600.159
right but it's all about the response to

5596.8 --> 5600.159000000001
that what are you gonna do with it

5600.56 --> 5605.679
right because say like 20 years ago

5604.0 --> 5607.92
a lot in my life i've had periods where

5605.679 --> 5610.2390000000005
i got so stressed out

5607.92 --> 5612.639
i would escape into just playing

5610.239 --> 5615.36
computer games

5612.639 --> 5616.2390000000005
sometimes i didn't even want to play it

5615.36 --> 5619.5199999999995
but i just

5616.239 --> 5621.28
needed to try and somehow get my focus

5619.52 --> 5623.6
off some really

5621.28 --> 5626.32
bad feelings that i was experiencing

5623.6 --> 5628.400000000001
that would last quite a long time

5626.32 --> 5631.84
and then i did that it seems very

5628.4 --> 5631.839999999999
familiar to me

5632.8 --> 5645.84
what you're doing

5646.0 --> 5648.32
what

5650.8 --> 5659.84
don't know what that is mn

5665.6 --> 5669.04
given up completely very relaxed oh well

5667.6 --> 5671.4400000000005
that explains everything

5669.04 --> 5673.44
so i was absolutely correct about

5671.44 --> 5674.239
everything i've said so far about you

5673.44 --> 5678.159
then

5674.239 --> 5678.159
that's exactly what's happening

5681.199 --> 5685.599999999999
yeah giving up completely yeah that does

5683.6 --> 5686.159000000001
relieve you from the stress of the

5685.6 --> 5688.0
burden

5686.159 --> 5689.36
of actually having to do something about

5688.0 --> 5694.239
it right

5689.36 --> 5694.239
yeah that that might seem very relieving

5694.32 --> 5696.88
at first

5697.679 --> 5701.84
then things are really to slip

5726.84 --> 5729.84
god

5737.92 --> 5740.56
what is that

5741.36 --> 5744.239
oh whoopty

5749.44 --> 5752.799999999999
why would i why did you need me to look

5752.08 --> 5756.88
into that

5752.8 --> 5759.1990000000005
and then why

5756.88 --> 5771.84
what's supposed to be so spectacular

5759.199 --> 5771.839999999999
about this

5799.199 --> 5805.759999999999
no howard moore he was referring to the

5802.48 --> 5805.759999999999
link he had posted

5810.4 --> 5817.759999999999
most accurate globe presupposing

5814.48 --> 5820.959999999999
earth map so far yeah i know mn

5817.76 --> 5823.6
most accurate globe presupposing earth

5820.96 --> 5826.8
map so far i know

5823.6 --> 5829.92
yeah a flat projection of a presupposed

5826.8 --> 5829.92
globe earth i know

5836.719 --> 5855.84
still no curvature though

5841.04 --> 5855.84
so very cute

5866.84 --> 5869.84
ugh

5880.239 --> 5885.44
oh really so how about the high altitude

5883.199 --> 5887.919999999999
photos that were taken

5885.44 --> 5889.599999999999
that don't show a globe what about those

5887.92 --> 5891.84
turtle doves

5889.6 --> 5893.52
right it's like instant projection with

5891.84 --> 5896.639
you every time

5893.52 --> 5899.360000000001
you immediately accuse

5896.639 --> 5901.679
your opposition of exactly the thing you

5899.36 --> 5903.44
do in the hopes that we don't pick up on

5901.679 --> 5906.4800000000005
that you're basically

5903.44 --> 5909.119
projecting immediately

5906.48 --> 5910.718999999999
they don't exist see yeah yeah yeah oh

5909.119 --> 5912.88
there you go

5910.719 --> 5915.119
yeah they do exist all over the place

5912.88 --> 5918.719
horizon is at eye level

5915.119 --> 5920.719
it's always at eye level oh

5918.719 --> 5922.08
yeah take away your fisheye lens from

5920.719 --> 5925.28
that certain angle or

5922.08 --> 5928.88
change the angle midway and then

5925.28 --> 5932.239
yeah oh now the fisheye lens is at

5928.88 --> 5933.1990000000005
the right angle because it looks like a

5932.239 --> 5935.28
globe

5933.199 --> 5936.799999999999
that's your train of thought oh look the

5935.28 --> 5939.199
camera is at the right angle

5936.8 --> 5942.0
now it looks like a globe so this is the

5939.199 --> 5945.678999999999
right thing because it has to be a glow

5942.0 --> 5947.6
right oh but then oh it changes oh

5945.679 --> 5949.6
suddenly it's so it's flat and oh it

5947.6 --> 5952.4800000000005
looks concave oh but

5949.6 --> 5954.2390000000005
that's just a camera distortion right

5952.48 --> 5957.839999999999
turtledove

5954.239 --> 5961.28
that's just a camera distortion because

5957.84 --> 5963.28
when the fisheye lens that provably has

5961.28 --> 5965.199
a visual distortion or whatever it's

5963.28 --> 5967.759999999999
displaying at times

5965.199 --> 5970.48
when it shows the earth like a globe

5967.76 --> 5973.84
that it is as it really is right

5970.48 --> 5977.28
right turtledove that's how it works

5973.84 --> 5981.76
yeah i'm not

5977.28 --> 5984.639
spending my energy on a complete zealot

5981.76 --> 5984.639
which is what you are

5985.04 --> 5989.119
i don't have to show you any freaking

5987.28 --> 5992.0
footage

5989.119 --> 5992.639
all the footage every footage all

5992.0 --> 5994.639
footage

5992.639 --> 5996.400000000001
all high altitude footage all of it

5994.639 --> 5998.400000000001
every footage that has ever been

5996.4 --> 6002.96
presumed to show the curve

5998.4 --> 6005.119
also shows no curve or concavity

6002.96 --> 6006.84
oh that's just camera distortion but

6005.119 --> 6009.759999999999
when it looks like a globe

6006.84 --> 6010.159000000001
that's and by the way not a full globe

6009.76 --> 6013.52
right

6010.159 --> 6015.92
only a partial glove yeah

6013.52 --> 6016.88
but that's really as is of course right

6015.92 --> 6018.88
right

6016.88 --> 6020.2390000000005
but but when it doesn't look like a

6018.88 --> 6024.08
globe sort of

6020.239 --> 6024.08
then it's camera distortion right

6033.119 --> 6037.119
oh wow look at all the squirters coming

6034.96 --> 6039.6
in there's a whole bunch of scumbags in

6037.119 --> 6039.599999999999
here now

6040.8 --> 6045.4400000000005
death nail zealots people that can't

6043.52 --> 6046.159000000001
even have the faculties to inform

6045.44 --> 6048.4
themselves

6046.159 --> 6049.28
but they do know the packing order right

6048.4 --> 6051.599999999999
you do know

6049.28 --> 6054.239
how to put somebody down that opposes

6051.6 --> 6057.52
you politically

6054.239 --> 6059.678999999999
pecking order little [ __ ] no arguments

6057.52 --> 6062.080000000001
just echo chamber

6059.679 --> 6064.4
things you literally don't mechanically

6062.08 --> 6067.6
understand yourself

6064.4 --> 6070.638999999999
but you equate all of you

6067.6 --> 6074.159000000001
anybody that watches

6070.639 --> 6078.08
that freak mr sensible is a complete

6074.159 --> 6079.199
[ __ ] every single one of them if

6078.08 --> 6081.28
you're smart

6079.199 --> 6083.599999999999
you're listening to that guy you're not

6081.28 --> 6085.36
going to be smart for long

6083.6 --> 6087.52
it's going to literally burn out your

6085.36 --> 6089.36
senses at some point

6087.52 --> 6090.56
because that's what happens when you

6089.36 --> 6093.36
surrender to

6090.56 --> 6094.400000000001
absolute buffoonery when you're actually

6093.36 --> 6097.759999999999
projecting

6094.4 --> 6100.0
intellectual authority onto somebody

6097.76 --> 6104.08
that is in your face displaying the

6100.0 --> 6106.88
dumbest [ __ ] imaginable

6104.08 --> 6108.239
that's what happens it makes you into a

6106.88 --> 6110.400000000001
[ __ ]

6108.239 --> 6111.599999999999
so have a lot of fun over there i'm not

6110.4 --> 6114.719
going there

6111.6 --> 6121.84
because it's [ __ ] his show

6114.719 --> 6121.84
is [ __ ] his chat is worse than [ __ ]

6122.719 --> 6127.679
but it was funny to kind of step towards

6125.28 --> 6130.88
it and just see what would happen

6127.679 --> 6131.92
as a little test just to see like how

6130.88 --> 6134.32
bad

6131.92 --> 6137.119
will they try to pull off their [ __ ] how

6134.32 --> 6139.44
much will they underestimate me

6137.119 --> 6141.119
how badly will they try to gaslight me

6139.44 --> 6142.719
because i knew they were gonna do that

6141.119 --> 6144.799999999999
one way or the other

6142.719 --> 6147.04
knew mr sensible does that [ __ ] i just

6144.8 --> 6148.08
kind of forgot that he also plays really

6147.04 --> 6150.719
stupid little

6148.08 --> 6152.88
videos with noises in the middle of my

6150.719 --> 6156.32
explanation

6152.88 --> 6158.8
i did i forgot about that part right

6156.32 --> 6159.36
this is such a classy thing to do isn't

6158.8 --> 6162.320000000001
it so

6159.36 --> 6162.88
classy to do that with a live interview

6162.32 --> 6166.08
right

6162.88 --> 6168.2390000000005
play little silly clips over it over

6166.08 --> 6171.6
somebody else in a live

6168.239 --> 6172.879999999999
situation yeah it's not not anti-social

6171.6 --> 6175.92
not disruptive at

6172.88 --> 6177.04
all no that's that's the sensible thing

6175.92 --> 6181.28
to do right

6177.04 --> 6182.96
right you're double thinking freaks

6181.28 --> 6184.639
you're in a death trap and you don't

6182.96 --> 6186.4
even know it

6184.639 --> 6188.08
the death trap is not his actions the

6186.4 --> 6191.839999999999
death trap is

6188.08 --> 6195.92
the mind conditions yeah

6191.84 --> 6200.400000000001
so when the mind dies so does the body

6195.92 --> 6204.0
ah have fun with that

6200.4 --> 6206.239
i hope you literally rocked in

6204.0 --> 6207.44
mind of god's hell which he says is

6206.239 --> 6209.44
earth here

6207.44 --> 6219.839999999999
and there are some esoteric truths to

6209.44 --> 6219.839999999999
that it's just not literal

6237.199 --> 6242.239
no it doesn't [ __ ] [ __ ]

6244.4 --> 6250.28
doesn't drop at all there was a drop due

6247.679 --> 6251.4400000000005
to geometric horizon it would

6250.28 --> 6254.5599999999995
continually

6251.44 --> 6256.96
drop continually drop

6254.56 --> 6257.92
not oh a slight nudge and then it just

6256.96 --> 6262.0
stays that way

6257.92 --> 6262.76
for miles and miles no no no continually

6262.0 --> 6265.84
drop

6262.76 --> 6266.96
continually drop it doesn't though cause

6265.84 --> 6275.119000000001
the earth is not

6266.96 --> 6278.08
a freaking sphere you goddamn [ __ ]

6275.119 --> 6280.08

to slap ballers around

6396.88 --> 6400.56
waking them up from their nonsense that

6399.679 --> 6403.84
would be

6400.56 --> 6407.1990000000005
