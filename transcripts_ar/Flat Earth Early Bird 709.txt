78.4 --> 81.84
other day well i just basically removed

81.04 --> 85.68
all that now

81.84 --> 87.84
and it seems exactly what it should be

85.68 --> 87.84
so

89.68 --> 94.32000000000001
logic makes no sense that happened but

92.96 --> 96.479

94.32 --> 97.83999999999999

135.92 --> 146.319
this there's a lot of storm

143.12 --> 152.08
likes is pretty heavy got winds gusts

146.319 --> 154.39999999999998
sometimes no rain though so far

152.08 --> 156.16000000000003
and yeah if you take a careful look you

154.4 --> 159.20000000000002
can see that the clouds are moving

156.16 --> 162.16
pretty fast up there

159.2 --> 162.879
there have been some nice clear spots

162.16 --> 164.79999999999998
though

162.879 --> 168.239
earlier where i did actually get some

164.8 --> 171.76000000000002
sun but just the wind kept on going so

168.239 --> 174.64000000000001
despite that sun it's just too windy to

171.76 --> 174.64
warm up to it

175.599 --> 179.599
so yeah

179.92 --> 186.79999999999998

uh

239.519 --> 247.04
hey matthew eastman

242.72 --> 247.04
no illuminati croissant that's that's

252.84 --> 257.28000000000003
correct

254.4 --> 259.519
didn't go to the store yet today just

257.28 --> 261.59999999999997
didn't really feel like it

259.519 --> 263.44
wanted to take my time just waking up

261.6 --> 264.08000000000004
slowly because i didn't get up pretty

263.44 --> 269.84
early

264.08 --> 269.84
like 11 o'clock

270.72 --> 275.199
but i feel great because i did have a

272.72 --> 277.28000000000003
great dinner yesterday again i did the

275.199 --> 280.08000000000004
the chicken and broccoli thing again it

277.28 --> 280.08
was just oh

281.12 --> 285.36
shouldn't do it every day and it's

283.28 --> 287.35999999999996
relatively expensive compared to other

285.36 --> 290.639
meals as well

287.36 --> 297.84000000000003
but yeah it's a good thing for every now

290.639 --> 297.84000000000003
and then

304.639 --> 313.52
catch flattoberfest speakers james true

310.08 --> 313.52
no i didn't catch him

314.72 --> 325.84000000000003
but i have heard of him also

318.32 --> 325.84
through a rasta head

327.039 --> 331.12
early is 6 a.m

331.84 --> 344.23999999999995
hey george sanford

338.4 --> 344.23999999999995
right so yeah to go through the notes

345.919 --> 350.79999999999995
right yeah the flat earth debate was was

349.12 --> 352.56
pretty good

350.8 --> 355.039
uh yeah a little bit still here and

352.56 --> 359.919
there and i wasn't all that active

355.039 --> 359.919
i think it's just that

360.0 --> 363.68
i don't know i it just was kind of laid

362.56 --> 365.84
back

363.68 --> 368.639
compared to some of the times i'm on the

365.84 --> 373.11999999999995
debates where i'm just very impulsive

368.639 --> 375.44
uh yeah i watch a bunch of movie or i

373.12 --> 378.08
watched a movie

375.44 --> 380.24
and a little bit of series that i said i

378.08 --> 383.039
was gonna watch some time ago

380.24 --> 383.84000000000003
and even managed to catch big bear

383.039 --> 388.15999999999997
really late

383.84 --> 389.67999999999995
streaming like i was about to go to bed

388.16 --> 394.8
and then it's just like oh

389.68 --> 396.96
own benjamin live really late damn it

394.8 --> 398.72
and that was good stuff and i got a

396.96 --> 400.56
subscription back

398.72 --> 402.8
somebody just handed it out so i can now

400.56 --> 404.08
talk again for the next month so that's

402.8 --> 406.16
nice

404.08 --> 408.0
because before i just had to communicate

406.16 --> 408.56
through lemons now i saved up a lot of

408.0 --> 411.599
those

408.56 --> 411.599
in order to do that

413.759 --> 417.28000000000003
so if you can't say if you just can't

416.16 --> 419.36
laugh and chat

417.28 --> 421.35999999999996
make funny comments then you can just

419.36 --> 423.84000000000003
throw out timed lemons

421.36 --> 423.84000000000003
so

428.4 --> 431.84
tiny wumbo lu

432.8 --> 436.0
but that was good stuff but as for the

435.199 --> 438.8
netflix

436.0 --> 439.12
stuff i watched this movie just popped

438.8 --> 442.88
up

439.12 --> 444.16
and in retrospect it kind of creeped me

442.88 --> 446.88
out a lot

444.16 --> 447.28000000000003
a lot about it it's it's it was probably

446.88 --> 451.199
a

447.28 --> 453.75899999999996
very very transhuman type movie

451.199 --> 454.72
i didn't expect it to be as much as it

453.759 --> 457.759
was

454.72 --> 461.68
but called bloodshot

457.759 --> 464.08000000000004
and it's like hardcore action transhuman

461.68 --> 465.28000000000003
[ __ ] with all kinds of cyber attack but

464.08 --> 469.44
it was so

465.28 --> 473.039
extensive like so like

469.44 --> 476.0
really like a lot

473.039 --> 477.199
a lot of guys probably like total tech

476.0 --> 480.08
geeks

477.199 --> 482.24
had a had like at their half their

480.08 --> 486.24
life's workport in this [ __ ] i think

482.24 --> 487.44
it was pretty damn well thought out

486.24 --> 489.36
now i didn't think that all the

487.44 --> 492.08
characters were really that likable but

489.36 --> 495.44
it was

492.08 --> 498.56
it was still a pretty intense and

495.44 --> 501.36
yeah i can't just say ew

498.56 --> 503.36
they're like it's like whoa dude there

501.36 --> 505.44
was a lot of attention put in this into

503.36 --> 509.28000000000003
this movie

505.44 --> 512.0
so but yeah it's not

509.28 --> 513.919
a very pleasant movie it's all pretty

512.0 --> 516.0
grim

513.919 --> 517.039
it's not like a gothic rim but it is

516.0 --> 520.24
grim

517.039 --> 523.36
like psychopathic in ways

520.24 --> 525.519
it's just about power and power through

523.36 --> 527.12
technology it's really all about that

525.519 --> 529.519
and even revenge so yeah

527.12 --> 533.12
not a movie that'll make you happy but

529.519 --> 533.12
it will definitely make you think

533.76 --> 539.68
in several ways uh

536.8 --> 539.68
not for children

546.839 --> 549.839
uh

550.32 --> 554.48
also very psychological but yeah it's

552.959 --> 563.8389999999999
basically

554.48 --> 563.839
i'm not gonna spoil any more of it

570.399 --> 578.64
okay thanks tom parker i guess

574.839 --> 582.0
uh right also i started to dig into this

578.64 --> 586.48
barbarians series

582.0 --> 586.48
but the germans versus the romans and

588.16 --> 593.1999999999999
yeah it weirdly enough it's kind of what

590.72 --> 597.839
i expected it was gonna be

593.2 --> 601.44
and doesn't really make you happy either

597.839 --> 604.9590000000001
but it just

601.44 --> 608.399
yeah it's it's like reality level

604.959 --> 611.68
grim it it almost

608.399 --> 612.64
like game of thrones level just harsh

611.68 --> 614.959
and real but

612.64 --> 616.64
not so much focused on just the [ __ ]

614.959 --> 620.079
psychopaths

616.64 --> 622.48
it's more story is yeah

620.079 --> 623.5999999999999
ah i don't know i just got through one

622.48 --> 626.24
episode but i was

623.6 --> 628.0
actually kind of impressed by it about

626.24 --> 629.6800000000001
how much it really was about the

628.0 --> 632.399
societal

629.68 --> 635.04
situation and they didn't really try to

632.399 --> 635.04
put a lot

635.12 --> 644.48
of atmosphere in it but yeah it's gonna

640.079 --> 646.4799999999999
what knowing just feeling it out i know

644.48 --> 648.48
this series probably going to hurt at

646.48 --> 649.2
certain points a lot kind of like game

648.48 --> 652.32
of thrones

649.2 --> 655.76
tend to do a lot so

652.32 --> 658.5600000000001
yeah i'm already like

655.76 --> 658.959
building this shield in anticipation

658.56 --> 662.079
like

658.959 --> 664.0
yeah they're probably gonna like do some

662.079 --> 664.3199999999999
really [ __ ] up things at some point

664.0 --> 667.36
they

664.32 --> 669.0400000000001
yeah because the preliminaries of that

667.36 --> 674.0
are already

669.04 --> 677.12
pretty apparent

674.0 --> 680.72
but yeah

677.12 --> 688.88
it's what i watched don't know how quick

680.72 --> 692.0
i'm gonna go through that series

688.88 --> 694.32
tired of dystopian future yeah i know

692.0 --> 697.12
what you mean tiny wombo it it

694.32 --> 697.839
well to me like especially like world

697.12 --> 701.04
disaster

697.839 --> 704.8800000000001
it now just seems like it's people

701.04 --> 709.4399999999999
whining like oh it's like

704.88 --> 713.12
i'm like no no no

709.44 --> 713.44
but okay let's just presuppose it will

713.12 --> 715.6
be

713.44 --> 718.5600000000001
i'll try to suspend my disbelief while

715.6 --> 718.5600000000001
i'm watching the movie

720.079 --> 723.1999999999999
but yeah they definitely don't freak me

722.16 --> 724.88
out or worry me

723.2 --> 726.639
as much as they used to of course

724.88 --> 729.76
realizing

726.639 --> 731.839
yeah how it now works and

729.76 --> 733.519
what mechanics it's actually based on

731.839 --> 736.8800000000001
the idea of it

733.519 --> 745.839
what that is and it doesn't worry me as

736.88 --> 745.8389999999999
much now

750.91 --> 754.299
[Music]

756.839 --> 759.839
so

769.92 --> 774.8
oh yeah yeah matthew mitchell i have

776.079 --> 780.7199999999999
i've seen it pop by i just i don't

778.56 --> 783.4399999999999
really think

780.72 --> 785.839
i wanna it's probably really high-tech

783.44 --> 788.24
sci-fi but i already said like even with

785.839 --> 791.0400000000001
that movie bloodshot

788.24 --> 793.44
i was really not that comfortable

791.04 --> 796.959
sitting through it it's just that it was

793.44 --> 800.0790000000001
very focused and that part

796.959 --> 803.279
is kind of rare now you know

800.079 --> 804.8
on average with movie material but

803.279 --> 806.399
yeah altered carbon i don't know if it's

804.8 --> 807.279
going to be that way but it's it's

806.399 --> 809.44
already like

807.279 --> 811.279
i know it's going to be way too much

809.44 --> 814.48
it's just going to drown me in that sort

811.279 --> 818.079
of [ __ ] i know it will

814.48 --> 821.6800000000001
from the pop-ups and all that i i yeah

818.079 --> 825.279
i'm very hesitant to even just

821.68 --> 825.279
try and watch some of it

825.36 --> 829.92
though i i'm not gonna say that i never

827.92 --> 832.0
will but i just don't really feel like

829.92 --> 832.0
it

836.16 --> 841.68
it's weird how that works and yeah i've

839.6 --> 844.5600000000001
done

841.68 --> 845.199
not watched things like that before and

844.56 --> 847.279
then

845.199 --> 848.88
it's very funny how that works out that

847.279 --> 852.24
like 20 years later

848.88 --> 854.399
i watch it and then i finally understand

852.24 --> 856.0
exactly why i didn't want to watch it

854.399 --> 858.959
and why that was probably a better

856.0 --> 861.04
decision it's so funny how it works out

858.959 --> 863.279
like that every time

861.04 --> 863.279
so

866.72 --> 871.839
it's even like trying to save the

872.24 --> 875.839
the new spark some if there are good

874.72 --> 877.839
sometimes i skip

875.839 --> 879.7600000000001
good things too for some reason because

877.839 --> 881.519
i'm like in a really shitty mood at that

879.76 --> 882.959
period and like no i'm not gonna watch

881.519 --> 886.16
this because it's not

882.959 --> 887.68
gonna help it's just gonna be wasted not

886.16 --> 888.959
gonna try to pretend like i'm not

887.68 --> 891.04
feeling shitty

888.959 --> 893.4399999999999
and then i forget about it and then much

891.04 --> 896.24
later when i do feel good i bump into it

893.44 --> 896.24
and it's like yeah

896.839 --> 899.839
awesome

901.36 --> 903.6800000000001
right

905.92 --> 909.68
it would help with likable character

910.839 --> 916.48
yeah

913.44 --> 920.32
likable or just honorable

916.48 --> 920.72
you know it's it's not even just about

920.32 --> 923.44
like

920.72 --> 924.0
it's also just about character strength

923.44 --> 927.6800000000001
because

924.0 --> 929.519
even people that are kind of shabby or

927.68 --> 932.6389999999999
whatever

929.519 --> 938.079
if they are have character strength

932.639 --> 938.0790000000001
you know then it's still an interesting

938.839 --> 944.1600000000001
character

941.279 --> 945.279
but it's very tough to to pull that off

944.16 --> 947.68
sometimes

945.279 --> 949.36
so yeah the actor really has to be able

947.68 --> 951.5999999999999
to do that to be

949.36 --> 952.88
to really role play that character well

951.6 --> 955.44
and get it

952.88 --> 957.8389999999999
and radiate that he gets it and then it

955.44 --> 957.839
works

966.32 --> 970.24
and that's also by the way by certain

968.16 --> 972.079
type of actors typically fall into

970.24 --> 975.44
certain type of roles because they

972.079 --> 979.199
really get that role they can radiate it

975.44 --> 982.24
make it work see

979.199 --> 984.16
it's because the actors get that they

982.24 --> 984.9590000000001
get what it's about they get what it's

984.16 --> 997.8389999999999
like

984.959 --> 997.8389999999999
they can live into it

998.56 --> 1003.8389999999999
does not always mean that it is them

1001.6 --> 1004.72
though you have to be careful with that

1003.839 --> 1010.0790000000001
it can be

1004.72 --> 1013.12
a shadow side of them that

1010.079 --> 1015.279
they just use for it but that doesn't

1013.12 --> 1018.5600000000001
mean that they would ever actually do

1015.279 --> 1020.0
anything like that in real life you have

1018.56 --> 1022.16
to consider that too

1020.0 --> 1024.16
but it yeah doesn't guarantee that they

1022.16 --> 1028.24
never would it's

1024.16 --> 1028.24
very confusing that way it's just yeah

1030.799 --> 1035.52
it really all depends on the man or the

1033.199 --> 1035.52
woman

1036.839 --> 1039.839
uh

1040.079 --> 1047.52
wow i got 1800 subscribers

1043.679 --> 1050.799
really did i

1047.52 --> 1053.9189999999999
oh my god i passed the 18 mark

1050.799 --> 1057.6
i didn't even know thanks

1053.919 --> 1060.64
huh well that only took

1057.6 --> 1060.6399999999999
at least a year

1065.44 --> 1070.64
is everybody bored with the lies oh

1076.48 --> 1084.559
yeah yeah that's right yeah male gig

1079.6 --> 1086.6399999999999
oh yeah there's a lot of people

1084.559 --> 1087.9189999999999
that like to watch this show i'm timing

1086.64 --> 1090.48
it live to

1087.919 --> 1091.5200000000002
get like the early energy in the us of

1090.48 --> 1093.919
certain individual

1091.52 --> 1095.28
i don't know i it's just the thing i've

1093.919 --> 1098.96
aimed for

1095.28 --> 1101.84
for the live part and the participation

1098.96 --> 1102.64
looking for certain type of fresh energy

1101.84 --> 1106.48
right

1102.64 --> 1108.5590000000002
but yeah that doesn't mean that

1106.48 --> 1109.84
everybody that's actually watching the

1108.559 --> 1112.6399999999999
show does

1109.84 --> 1113.52
so live every time not everybody wants

1112.64 --> 1115.76
to interact

1113.52 --> 1118.16
for a lot of people it's quite a hassle

1115.76 --> 1119.84
probably or they're very nervous or

1118.16 --> 1121.3600000000001
all kinds of reasons why they just want

1119.84 --> 1124.9599999999998
to watch

1121.36 --> 1126.1599999999999
learn or enjoy or whatever

1124.96 --> 1129.3600000000001
that doesn't mean that they're going to

1126.16 --> 1129.3600000000001
be there live watching

1132.08 --> 1136.1599999999999
i get plenty of comments of people

1134.32 --> 1138.24
telling me like hey yeah i do watch your

1136.16 --> 1140.0800000000002
show it's awesome

1138.24 --> 1142.32
i'll try to be there like people say

1140.08 --> 1145.1999999999998
that too i'll try to be their life

1142.32 --> 1145.9189999999999
i do appreciate that but yeah don't

1145.2 --> 1147.76
break up

1145.919 --> 1150.16
your day or something to try and be

1147.76 --> 1155.52
their life it's just

1150.16 --> 1160.4
it's cool if you could be but yeah

1155.52 --> 1162.8799999999999
don't don't twist your life around just

1160.4 --> 1164.24
to be their life that seems a little bit

1162.88 --> 1166.48
too far for me

1164.24 --> 1168.88
you know it's important that yeah your

1166.48 --> 1172.16
life getting it together

1168.88 --> 1174.88
ascending learning that's the best

1172.16 --> 1177.679
thing i can get out of it that's really

1174.88 --> 1180.7990000000002
kind of sort of the main objective

1177.679 --> 1183.76
so if you keep that in mind

1180.799 --> 1185.84
if you're just doing great and you're

1183.76 --> 1187.36
echoing the right frequency into the

1185.84 --> 1190.3999999999999
world

1187.36 --> 1194.08
that makes me very happy

1190.4 --> 1197.2800000000002
and relieved too because for me

1194.08 --> 1199.039
the world is really in crisis in a

1197.28 --> 1203.76
mental crisis

1199.039 --> 1207.12
an emotional crisis it's been been just

1203.76 --> 1209.039
left to its devices and then just

1207.12 --> 1210.6399999999999
lots of nonsense on it and people are

1209.039 --> 1212.32
just all over the place

1210.64 --> 1214.3200000000002
and even the ones sometimes that are all

1212.32 --> 1215.84
over the place and that wanna get out of

1214.32 --> 1216.8799999999999
it they don't know how because they're

1215.84 --> 1219.1999999999998
all surrounded by

1216.88 --> 1220.4
the same type of frequencies and people

1219.2 --> 1223.039
are keep pulling them back

1220.4 --> 1225.2
in i've been there it's brutally

1223.039 --> 1226.64
difficult to even conceive of trying to

1225.2 --> 1228.32
get out of it

1226.64 --> 1230.48
because you start to think that that is

1228.32 --> 1234.32
the world so by being an

1230.48 --> 1237.44
exception in that i hope to give people

1234.32 --> 1241.6
basically the hand

1237.44 --> 1241.6000000000001
to draw them out of that swamp

1244.159 --> 1247.2800000000002
and prevent them from yeah getting back

1246.64 --> 1250.5590000000002
dragged

1247.28 --> 1252.8799999999999
back in by the goblins because yeah

1250.559 --> 1254.559
if you lift for a very long time in the

1252.88 --> 1257.3600000000001
swamp it's very hard

1254.559 --> 1258.6399999999999
to drop the habit of walking right back

1257.36 --> 1262.9599999999998
in by accident

1258.64 --> 1266.159
that happens too

1262.96 --> 1268.799
so just try to be consistent keep it

1266.159 --> 1272.5590000000002
going for as long as it can

1268.799 --> 1277.12
for as long as i can as long as it's

1272.559 --> 1279.76
it seems productive to me feels right

1277.12 --> 1281.6
and then yeah we'll see how many people

1279.76 --> 1286.72
got out

1281.6 --> 1286.7199999999998
and can help fix the situation

1287.84 --> 1291.1999999999998
because there's a lot of fixing that

1289.36 --> 1293.1999999999998
needs to be done and it's like

1291.2 --> 1294.96
the more you see it if the more tiresome

1293.2 --> 1298.4
it becomes and then a lot of people

1294.96 --> 1301.76
again or you see that responsibility

1298.4 --> 1301.76
becomes quite crushing

1302.72 --> 1307.1200000000001
because it seems you're alone and your

1306.159 --> 1309.6000000000001
insights

1307.12 --> 1311.4399999999998
on the high end will not reflect as much

1309.6 --> 1313.36
because people are preoccupied with

1311.44 --> 1315.28
lesser things

1313.36 --> 1317.12
and then that way it's all falls on your

1315.28 --> 1318.24
consciousness very punishing and then a

1317.12 --> 1320.08
lot of people yeah

1318.24 --> 1321.52
slip back in and if there's enough

1320.08 --> 1325.28
people that

1321.52 --> 1328.1589999999999
to together upholds

1325.28 --> 1329.9189999999999
that consciousness wait and know there

1328.159 --> 1333.5200000000002
are others

1329.919 --> 1336.3200000000002
that relieves that pressure so much

1333.52 --> 1336.799
it's unbelievable sometimes especially

1336.32 --> 1338.72
if you

1336.799 --> 1341.039
have felt isolated like that for a long

1338.72 --> 1341.039
time

1343.52 --> 1347.84
all right

1356.72 --> 1362.32
huh yeah but that 1800 that really just

1360.96 --> 1364.24
slipped by

1362.32 --> 1366.799
didn't realize that that i he had even

1364.24 --> 1366.799
gotten there

1370.32 --> 1375.84
emmanuel aviles

1382.159 --> 1389.8400000000001
manuel aviles yes

1396.24 --> 1400.249
right so

1397.18 --> 1400.249
[Music]

1401.039 --> 1405.6
uh yeah i was getting kind of ethereal

1404.64 --> 1408.5590000000002
there

1405.6 --> 1409.6
what i'm trying to achieve all that i've

1408.559 --> 1412.24
been thinking

1409.6 --> 1412.9599999999998
a lot more about also in the background

1412.24 --> 1415.28
on my own

1412.96 --> 1417.1200000000001
about the dark world mechanics about the

1415.28 --> 1419.28
virtual it's

1417.12 --> 1421.039
it's so weird because while i'm

1419.28 --> 1424.72
consciously considering it

1421.039 --> 1431.84
it's almost it's really bizarre

1424.72 --> 1431.84
it's almost seems like i'm

1433.2 --> 1440.559
i'm building an echo but

1436.64 --> 1443.279
maybe i'm the echo it's

1440.559 --> 1444.0
it's quite surreal basically remembering

1443.279 --> 1446.48
it and then

1444.0 --> 1448.24
solidifying it and really try to

1446.48 --> 1451.44
re-simulate it because

1448.24 --> 1453.84
yeah it's my imagination when it focuses

1451.44 --> 1455.6000000000001
really strong it's almost like i see a

1453.84 --> 1457.12
holodeck sometimes when i'm really

1455.6 --> 1458.799
focused

1457.12 --> 1460.32
very similar to the dark world

1458.799 --> 1463.76
experience except there

1460.32 --> 1464.32
you're locked into it and it is maximum

1463.76 --> 1466.96
bright

1464.32 --> 1468.32
and you can't dim it down like that i

1466.96 --> 1472.88
couldn't at least

1468.32 --> 1476.0
uh but yes

1472.88 --> 1478.24
it's fascinating trying to figure it out

1476.0 --> 1481.039
it's just trying to figure out what it

1478.24 --> 1481.039
is what happened

1482.96 --> 1489.8400000000001
hey mark taylor

1486.32 --> 1493.039
do i have a comment about riley

1489.84 --> 1493.039
uh not really

1493.12 --> 1498.8799999999999
i think there's something happened

1496.799 --> 1502.559
and that could be two things if i get it

1498.88 --> 1502.5590000000002
right this this new stupid

1502.64 --> 1510.4
low brow [ __ ] going down i think

1506.96 --> 1514.08
and either two scenarios

1510.4 --> 1517.1200000000001
right so yeah because this is about

1514.08 --> 1518.8799999999999
conspiracy catch right

1517.12 --> 1521.1999999999998
so either two things could have happened

1518.88 --> 1524.96
i haven't heard out tony about it yet

1521.2 --> 1528.4
maybe he did say that

1524.96 --> 1530.64
like called him a pedo which is

1528.4 --> 1532.64
nasty it's kind of like bullying but

1530.64 --> 1534.5590000000002
yeah he really can't stand

1532.64 --> 1535.76
conspiracy cats he shared that with me

1534.559 --> 1538.24
it's personal

1535.76 --> 1539.36
like he just he feels there's more

1538.24 --> 1542.799
nefarious

1539.36 --> 1545.039
things in him now i do

1542.799 --> 1546.08
not feel that on the surface but there

1545.039 --> 1547.919
is he's

1546.08 --> 1550.1589999999999
this guy's been through some [ __ ] i

1547.919 --> 1551.279
think and that's probably what tony's

1550.159 --> 1553.919
picking up on and

1551.279 --> 1555.279
he has this response so it could have

1553.919 --> 1557.6000000000001
been that he said this

1555.279 --> 1558.4
or it could be even worse and that

1557.6 --> 1560.7199999999998
there's like

1558.4 --> 1562.64
conspiracy cats is trying to set him up

1560.72 --> 1565.6000000000001
pretending like he said that

1562.64 --> 1565.6000000000001
could be either way

1566.0 --> 1573.679
to me it's it's all low brow stuff

1570.559 --> 1575.76
so like

1573.679 --> 1578.64
what does it really matter it's just all

1575.76 --> 1578.64
a bunch of at home

1582.24 --> 1586.24
so yeah it doesn't change my opinion or

1585.12 --> 1588.799
anything about tony

1586.24 --> 1590.24
like i think i get what's going on and

1588.799 --> 1592.72
yeah it's just

1590.24 --> 1593.84
hey comments on the internet it wasn't

1592.72 --> 1598.48
even like done

1593.84 --> 1598.48
publicly on the show or anything so

1601.76 --> 1606.64
hey barry davis i don't know what that

1605.6 --> 1610.8799999999999
means

1606.64 --> 1615.1200000000001
you would oh right all right

1610.88 --> 1615.1200000000001
as in are you okay yeah i'm doing great

1617.919 --> 1627.279
right today also of course election day

1621.44 --> 1631.039
in the united states

1627.279 --> 1631.52
and yeah no to no surprise to anyone i

1631.039 --> 1635.36
think i

1631.52 --> 1635.36
yeah listen to some of alex jones

1635.52 --> 1641.2
and yeah i'd say that

1640.03 --> 1643.76
[Music]

1641.2 --> 1646.72
it's still interesting i also use some

1643.76 --> 1646.72
interesting words

1647.2 --> 1653.76
like he used certain ethereal

1650.72 --> 1654.0
or esoteric terminologies and i find

1653.76 --> 1658.1589999999999
that

1654.0 --> 1661.76
very fascinating it very fast

1658.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
the guy is he's such a wizard man but

1661.76 --> 1669.84
i don't know this is

1672.32 --> 1676.1589999999999
didn't really watch all of it for a very

1674.159 --> 1679.919
long time i just got

1676.159 --> 1683.44
just like tested the water see like okay

1679.919 --> 1684.159
did my preliminary insights did did i

1683.44 --> 1687.8400000000001
get it right

1684.159 --> 1691.679
i spoke out about it like did i

1687.84 --> 1694.08
did i hit the right tone

1691.679 --> 1695.279
like did i get it right as in because

1694.08 --> 1697.84
for me

1695.279 --> 1698.399
it's not like oh yeah i'm literally just

1697.84 --> 1701.6789999999999
pret

1698.399 --> 1705.1999999999998
and i'm trying to make a prediction here

1701.679 --> 1708.8400000000001
feeling it out trying to make order

1705.2 --> 1712.64
in the confusion and i think that

1708.84 --> 1715.4399999999998
yeah my insights resonated

1712.64 --> 1715.44
with them as well

1717.92 --> 1721.069
[Music]

1722.72 --> 1725.84
here

1723.62 --> 1739.84
[Music]

1725.84 --> 1739.84
hey dank

1745.679 --> 1749.919
hmm okay tiny bumble thanks for the

1748.32 --> 1753.84
input

1749.919 --> 1753.8400000000001
could be

1759.36 --> 1767.12
what really mandatory testing

1763.76 --> 1781.6
in liverpool

1767.12 --> 1784.7199999999998
that's that's insane man

1781.6 --> 1786.7199999999998
like if that's really going to work like

1784.72 --> 1790.24
if that's really going to be done for

1786.72 --> 1790.24
real it's going to be

1790.399 --> 1795.52
it's called it's going to be the

1792.159 --> 1798.5590000000002
situation in that freaking movie

1795.52 --> 1798.559
this is called again

1800.799 --> 1809.84
yeah that that's the wind it's literally

1804.32 --> 1809.84
vibrating the place crazy

1813.919 --> 1820.159
okay okay not mandatory yeah

1817.6 --> 1822.9599999999998
but people are blabbering out anything

1820.159 --> 1825.679
now it's just

1822.96 --> 1826.64
so i don't know i don't know anymore

1825.679 --> 1830.88
sometimes

1826.64 --> 1833.1200000000001
i just know that's that's crazy

1830.88 --> 1834.24
they're really going to like march

1833.12 --> 1837.52
military

1834.24 --> 1838.799
uniform people into houses and just hold

1837.52 --> 1841.6
people and then

1838.799 --> 1841.6
do that that's

1845.6 --> 1854.48
that's crazy

1850.399 --> 1856.799
so not mandatory yet yeah yeah but

1854.48 --> 1858.08
you know it's all just blah blah blah

1856.799 --> 1861.44
until

1858.08 --> 1866.559
it's being done and that could be

1861.44 --> 1866.559
just flash decision based almost so

1867.2 --> 1874.48
but yeah depends on the conditions and

1871.2 --> 1875.6000000000001
like and on the realization are they

1874.48 --> 1878.64
really

1875.6 --> 1881.279
able to deal with what will happen when

1878.64 --> 1883.1200000000001
they start doing that

1881.279 --> 1885.36
are they ready for the consequences of

1883.12 --> 1887.6
that

1885.36 --> 1889.279
because every like the whole energy is

1887.6 --> 1893.84
gonna flip around and [ __ ]

1889.279 --> 1893.84
it's crazy

1901.919 --> 1907.279
they're ready they might think that

1904.399 --> 1909.9189999999999
they're ready

1907.279 --> 1911.519
they're still sitting in the energy as

1909.919 --> 1914.0800000000002
it is now that energy

1911.519 --> 1915.36
is gonna change once that [ __ ] starts to

1914.08 --> 1918.96
happen

1915.36 --> 1920.799
and then they might not be that ready

1918.96 --> 1923.2
but they might not realize it because

1920.799 --> 1925.519
they are [ __ ] fools

1923.2 --> 1935.8400000000001
that can't see beyond what they're

1925.519 --> 1935.84
feeling at the moment

1958.0 --> 1964.64
okay well here we go again it's

1962.399 --> 1966.559
all right so they're doing it because of

1964.64 --> 1967.1200000000001
the pushback what are you suggesting

1966.559 --> 1969.84
they are

1967.12 --> 1970.1589999999999
literally like the government is trying

1969.84 --> 1972.8799999999999
to

1970.159 --> 1974.8400000000001
provoke civil war is that what you're

1972.88 --> 1977.8400000000001
saying

1974.84 --> 1977.84
really

1978.96 --> 1984.08
to what end and what are the long-term

1982.799 --> 1987.12
consequences are you

1984.08 --> 1991.84
serious with

1987.12 --> 1991.84
every how everything works

1993.919 --> 2005.8400000000001
that's that's like financial suicide

2017.44 --> 2023.039
data collection dude you have a computer

2024.559 --> 2031.12
uh you have an account on youtube

2028.08 --> 2033.4399999999998
so why

2031.12 --> 2034.2399999999998
are you presuming that they'd even need

2033.44 --> 2037.039
any of that

2034.24 --> 2037.84
for real all that data collection like

2037.039 --> 2039.84
the data

2037.84 --> 2041.4399999999998
is available i don't know if you guys

2039.84 --> 2046.24
know this but it's been

2041.44 --> 2049.2000000000003
for like 10 years

2046.24 --> 2051.119
electronic device in the last 10 years

2049.2 --> 2053.7599999999998
that has been made by

2051.119 --> 2055.9190000000003
mega corporations which means basically

2053.76 --> 2059.9190000000003
all computers

2055.919 --> 2060.399
have standardized modulate like modules

2059.919 --> 2063.44
built

2060.399 --> 2065.44
into the design of it all that functions

2063.44 --> 2067.359
as an internet of things information

2065.44 --> 2067.919
gathering technology that doesn't even

2067.359 --> 2071.839
need

2067.919 --> 2076.7999999999997
for the device to be plugged in okay

2071.839 --> 2080.0
yeah that's been there for over 10 years

2076.8 --> 2083.679
they don't need to do anything

2080.0 --> 2084.639
for data gathering the only reason why

2083.679 --> 2087.119
they would even

2084.639 --> 2089.44
do anything physical is well because

2087.119 --> 2091.839
they would be experimenting

2089.44 --> 2093.599
maybe and then see how people respond

2091.839 --> 2096.72
and then get the data gathering from

2093.599 --> 2102.4
that through the internet of things but

2096.72 --> 2106.56
yeah why

2102.4 --> 2106.56
is that good enough

2107.04 --> 2110.8
reason a bunch of data gathering to

2109.44 --> 2113.68
basically

2110.8 --> 2115.6800000000003
upheaval the entire situation of the

2113.68 --> 2118.7999999999997
country

2115.68 --> 2121.44
because yeah the first thing to go in

2118.8 --> 2123.52
civil war is the economy

2121.44 --> 2126.32
it's very ironic how i learned that

2123.52 --> 2128.56
through computer game

2126.32 --> 2130.8
because when that happens just like yeah

2128.56 --> 2132.96
no more income you have to deal with it

2130.8 --> 2136.4
first yeah no [ __ ]

2132.96 --> 2139.52
it's logical so but

2136.4 --> 2143.52
right you know so what

2139.52 --> 2145.04
what is it really it just seems to be

2143.52 --> 2147.28
more like they're trying to date a

2145.04 --> 2149.44
gather by spreading the stories they're

2147.28 --> 2152.5600000000004
going to do it and then see how people

2149.44 --> 2153.92
respond to that and then do

2152.56 --> 2155.599
all kinds of things with that

2153.92 --> 2157.2000000000003
information and maybe change the

2155.599 --> 2158.079
landscape and they'll probably more

2157.2 --> 2160.96
interested in

2158.079 --> 2161.599
how that alters things you know because

2160.96 --> 2163.92
that's

2161.599 --> 2165.52
right down secret service lane

2163.92 --> 2169.52
especially cia but yeah

2165.52 --> 2172.96
every government by now right

2169.52 --> 2174.96
story makers see what the stories do to

2172.96 --> 2176.079
the people how does it change the way

2174.96 --> 2180.2400000000002
you're thinking

2176.079 --> 2183.3590000000004
ah that's the real social engineering so

2180.24 --> 2185.52
maybe you unwittingly have started to

2183.359 --> 2188.56
echo a certain type of

2185.52 --> 2190.8
angle an approach to an idea

2188.56 --> 2192.56
that might not reflect reality all that

2190.8 --> 2195.04
well but because you're spreading that

2192.56 --> 2197.2
idea people

2195.04 --> 2199.44
may start to just like you ought to

2197.2 --> 2200.16
assume that it is actually exactly like

2199.44 --> 2202.0
that

2200.16 --> 2203.2799999999997
you got to be careful with the

2202.0 --> 2206.72
information you're

2203.28 --> 2210.0
are assimilating

2206.72 --> 2211.04
you're going to realize that where does

2210.0 --> 2214.32
this drive to

2211.04 --> 2217.44
is this logical or is this just really

2214.32 --> 2220.079
hypey to reel you in get you emotionally

2217.44 --> 2224.56
invested come on people

2220.079 --> 2224.5600000000004
this has been going on for freaking 20

2226.839 --> 2229.839
years

2230.07 --> 2233.1690000000003
[Music]

2236.48 --> 2243.839
or will comes into a bush hack or

2245.52 --> 2251.92
yeah but what you're talking about is a

2248.56 --> 2253.68
consent based system

2251.92 --> 2255.599
that means people that would be like

2253.68 --> 2257.1189999999997
yeah yeah i'll do it i'll do it just

2255.599 --> 2259.6800000000003
don't

2257.119 --> 2261.04
make it worse that but it's voluntary

2259.68 --> 2264.0789999999997
base so that could never

2261.04 --> 2266.16
be mandatory to suggest that

2264.079 --> 2267.119
just goes to show that you don't

2266.16 --> 2268.8799999999997
understand

2267.119 --> 2270.32
what is really happening and how it

2268.88 --> 2274.0
works

2270.32 --> 2276.32
so far and again if it would change

2274.0 --> 2277.68
then everything change and this system

2276.32 --> 2279.92
of voluntaries

2277.68 --> 2280.7999999999997
voluntary based trickery could not work

2279.92 --> 2282.32
anymore either

2280.8 --> 2299.8390000000004
that would break the spell it would

2282.32 --> 2299.839
break the codes did you get it

2330.16 --> 2336.0
right yeah yeah well people with jobs

2333.119 --> 2339.92
yeah they're going to be

2336.0 --> 2342.56
bothered it the whole process is

2339.92 --> 2346.32
effectively eroding

2342.56 --> 2348.56
the the working world

2346.32 --> 2350.56
it's not so much businesses it's like

2348.56 --> 2354.16
businesses that have

2350.56 --> 2354.96
a work like workforce so that's kind of

2354.16 --> 2358.48
it

2354.96 --> 2360.16
the corona measures is actively eroding

2358.48 --> 2363.44
the workforce

2360.16 --> 2363.7599999999998
everywhere because that's kind of like

2363.44 --> 2366.8
the

2363.76 --> 2369.0400000000004
the new strategy

2366.8 --> 2370.88
that's what the powerful ones want they

2369.04 --> 2371.52
don't need really the workforce anymore

2370.88 --> 2374.48
they got

2371.52 --> 2374.48
financialism

2378.16 --> 2386.0
they think they have enough

2382.16 --> 2386.0
to keep control without it

2388.72 --> 2392.9599999999996
so yeah what are we going to do with

2390.96 --> 2394.96
that are we then going to just let it

2392.96 --> 2397.839
take away say oh

2394.96 --> 2398.96
now i'm not this anymore because i can't

2397.839 --> 2401.52
work

2398.96 --> 2402.56
or are you gonna say what the [ __ ] is

2401.52 --> 2405.599
this

2402.56 --> 2409.2799999999997
they're literally trying to destroy us

2405.599 --> 2412.8
as a workforce so maybe we should

2409.28 --> 2415.2000000000003
replace that and really

2412.8 --> 2417.04
try to find other constructions to apply

2415.2 --> 2419.839
our craft

2417.04 --> 2420.88
and maybe try to kind of like grass

2419.839 --> 2424.16
roots

2420.88 --> 2428.6400000000003
re yeah restore a new

2424.16 --> 2428.64
way of being your profession

2429.92 --> 2434.7200000000003
find a way through that is the most

2432.88 --> 2436.56
sensible it's very tough though because

2434.72 --> 2436.8799999999997
yeah people have been used to just but

2436.56 --> 2440.16
no

2436.88 --> 2442.4
i got this job that job is my life and

2440.16 --> 2443.5989999999997
how can that change yeah it's very tough

2442.4 --> 2448.56
for some people

2443.599 --> 2448.56
once they get really used to that but

2448.88 --> 2453.599
we could just tried to step away from

2452.8 --> 2456.5600000000004
some of that

2453.599 --> 2457.44
government structuralized influence that

2456.56 --> 2460.72
kind of

2457.44 --> 2463.04
gave well in the past a relatively solid

2460.72 --> 2465.2
foundation to do it all

2463.04 --> 2466.48
well it's not so solid anymore so we

2465.2 --> 2469.68
kind of then have to

2466.48 --> 2470.2400000000002
do it grassroots approach again society

2469.68 --> 2473.359
building

2470.24 --> 2474.64
from ground up more craftsmanship style

2473.359 --> 2478.56
that's really

2474.64 --> 2480.8799999999997
the only way we'll not lose everything

2478.56 --> 2482.7999999999997
like the heritage of the knowledge and

2480.88 --> 2486.079
the crafts

2482.8 --> 2486.7200000000003
if we just let the corporations and the

2486.079 --> 2489.599
government

2486.72 --> 2490.56
take it away then we will to lose this

2489.599 --> 2493.44
skill

2490.56 --> 2495.119
again and then you will be slaves

2493.44 --> 2497.76
eventually

2495.119 --> 2497.76
do you see

2499.76 --> 2509.8390000000004
because if you can't do anything you

2502.4 --> 2509.839
will be a slave

2513.1 --> 2516.199
[Music]

2516.48 --> 2521.2
online automated work yeah well but that

2519.839 --> 2524.24
is just

2521.2 --> 2527.52
that's just jobs that's not

2524.24 --> 2533.4399999999996
a a career that like

2527.52 --> 2536.64
you know well in some ways it is

2533.44 --> 2538.079
but because look guys automation is not

2536.64 --> 2542.56
even as good

2538.079 --> 2542.5600000000004
as the elite liked it to be

2543.44 --> 2547.599
right because computers break down the

2545.44 --> 2551.359
more complicated things they have to do

2547.599 --> 2554.96
the more complicated the issues will be

2551.359 --> 2558.0789999999997
and yeah guess what humans tend to

2554.96 --> 2561.119
when they're actually really into it

2558.079 --> 2563.44
learn a lot faster than computers

2561.119 --> 2565.599
and they can correct errors a lot better

2563.44 --> 2568.8
than computers

2565.599 --> 2570.079
right so it's all very nice that they

2568.8 --> 2572.079
think that they can do

2570.079 --> 2573.6800000000003
replace everything like replace all

2572.079 --> 2576.6400000000003
transport and all that

2573.68 --> 2577.1189999999997
it's very cute guess what it's going to

2576.64 --> 2580.319
be a

2577.119 --> 2582.2400000000002
total disaster

2580.319 --> 2583.359
and not just like oh people are gonna

2582.24 --> 2585.839
die no

2583.359 --> 2586.7999999999997
also literally it's just gonna break

2585.839 --> 2590.48
down

2586.8 --> 2592.8
like just break up like eventually there

2590.48 --> 2595.359
will be an engineer shortage

2592.8 --> 2596.0
or like a revolt of the programmers or

2595.359 --> 2599.68
whatever

2596.0 --> 2603.359
and total disaster unlike anything

2599.68 --> 2606.64
seen before like right

2603.359 --> 2610.0
so it doesn't work

2606.64 --> 2613.2
they don't get that computers are

2610.0 --> 2617.839
only a tool and robots as well

2613.2 --> 2617.839
of humans no human no robot

2618.319 --> 2621.359
because yeah you could build a

2620.24 --> 2624.319
self-creating

2621.359 --> 2628.0789999999997
self-defending even computer system

2624.319 --> 2631.2
that's never really gonna do anything

2628.079 --> 2634.6400000000003
except yeah because it has

2631.2 --> 2636.72
no purpose

2634.64 --> 2638.48
that correlates with just human

2636.72 --> 2642.0
development and all that

2638.48 --> 2644.48
so all of it is totally senseless it's

2642.0 --> 2647.52
all based on science fiction dreams

2644.48 --> 2649.2
it doesn't actually work

2647.52 --> 2651.44
you know computers can make things

2649.2 --> 2653.52
faster but if there's no one to actually

2651.44 --> 2656.16
understand what they're doing

2653.52 --> 2657.92
then things grow out of control and then

2656.16 --> 2660.56
you just have to cancel it

2657.92 --> 2660.56
try again

2661.119 --> 2664.7200000000003
it's yeah

2666.56 --> 2671.359
it's not going to develop anything

2669.599 --> 2673.119
it's just going to make things very fast

2671.359 --> 2674.72
for the people that want to be very very

2673.119 --> 2677.2000000000003
very first

2674.72 --> 2678.7999999999997
have the ultimate advantage every time

2677.2 --> 2691.839
that's really the only thing that it

2678.8 --> 2691.8390000000004
will do

2700.0 --> 2705.839
[Applause]

2702.839 --> 2705.839
ah

2740.64 --> 2747.839
all right

2755.2 --> 2761.839
yeah that's right silence i'm just

2757.359 --> 2766.0
baffled about

2761.839 --> 2766.0
the same thing happening again and again

2766.16 --> 2772.56
hey german you know you guys it's just

2770.319 --> 2773.52
i i tried to warn you of this and you're

2772.56 --> 2776.0
just

2773.52 --> 2777.359
right back into that railroad and you

2776.0 --> 2780.72
don't even realize it

2777.359 --> 2783.5989999999997
it's you are auto piloting do you

2780.72 --> 2783.5989999999997
realize that

2784.72 --> 2790.0
trying to lift you out of that railroad

2787.119 --> 2803.839
but you keep on just going back there

2790.0 --> 2803.839
again and again

2808.83 --> 2812.139
[Music]

2813.359 --> 2818.72
all right well okay that's good at least

2815.839 --> 2818.72
i agree with that

2821.839 --> 2828.7999999999997
because guys to me this is the age of

2825.28 --> 2830.88
illusion i even wrote it out

2828.8 --> 2833.28
i already knew it was illusion i just

2830.88 --> 2836.4
didn't know how incredibly right i was

2833.28 --> 2839.2000000000003
at the time with the preliminary insight

2836.4 --> 2839.2000000000003
it really is

2839.599 --> 2843.839
it's just i've even said it earlier on

2842.24 --> 2845.7599999999998
in the early word show like the vast

2843.839 --> 2847.7599999999998
majority of the information we get

2845.76 --> 2851.3590000000004
confronted with

2847.76 --> 2853.76
we can't really pinpoint back

2851.359 --> 2855.5989999999997
and it turns out that the vast majority

2853.76 --> 2858.4
will be

2855.599 --> 2859.52
conceived by individuals and then let

2858.4 --> 2864.079
down a chain

2859.52 --> 2864.079
and then where it came from gets lost

2864.16 --> 2868.96
and then you'll be surprised how little

2866.559 --> 2870.7200000000003
we actually really know for for certain

2868.96 --> 2873.839
but yeah because we have this

2870.72 --> 2877.5989999999997
auto talent of modeling with our minds

2873.839 --> 2882.0
like that in information we can

2877.599 --> 2882.0
achieve fascinating things

2884.079 --> 2887.28
but if people realize how much of what

2886.88 --> 2889.92
they

2887.28 --> 2891.0400000000004
think is real is actually illusion and

2889.92 --> 2901.839
i'm not talking about

2891.04 --> 2901.839
a dichotomy situation

2902.96 --> 2906.8
i'm talking about how many dichotomies

2905.28 --> 2909.0400000000004
are they confronted with

2906.8 --> 2915.8390000000004
do they realize were handed to them

2909.04 --> 2915.839
specifically to obsess over

2920.4 --> 2923.92
now by the way thank you that flat

2922.079 --> 2926.8390000000004
fellow for the 99 cent super chat

2923.92 --> 2929.839
donation much appreciated

2926.839 --> 2929.839
cheers

2933.24 --> 2936.4199999999996
[Music]

2943.52 --> 2948.72
right yeah george sanford automation

2946.559 --> 2950.88
cannot replace repairmen

2948.72 --> 2954.3999999999996
it's correct but there's another

2950.88 --> 2957.839
unfortunate side effect of doubling down

2954.4 --> 2961.76
on that notion and that is they can

2957.839 --> 2965.119
sort of temporarily bypass it

2961.76 --> 2968.079
by making things

2965.119 --> 2969.52
break and replaceable so it's just they

2968.079 --> 2973.04
keep

2969.52 --> 2974.8
it breaks well they just build a new one

2973.04 --> 2976.96
now the new one and it's just gonna

2974.8 --> 2978.559
cause giant trash piles so even if a

2976.96 --> 2979.92
robot would do everything it would

2978.559 --> 2985.8390000000004
eventually lead to

2979.92 --> 2985.839
giant trash piles

2990.0 --> 2993.599
we've seen it even in the industry kind

2992.48 --> 2997.359
of happening

2993.599 --> 3000.559
it's mobile phone trash

2997.359 --> 3004.24
an ipad trash and

3000.559 --> 3007.52
computer monitors

3004.24 --> 3011.5989999999997
oh those not so much but just and cars

3007.52 --> 3013.68
they're all just very flashy

3011.599 --> 3015.599
then eventually they break down like in

3013.68 --> 3020.48
a controlled fashion they are like

3015.599 --> 3023.52
timed to die you throw them away

3020.48 --> 3024.8
and then you get a new one prefab yeah

3023.52 --> 3028.16
that's

3024.8 --> 3030.559
what kind of leads to a more

3028.16 --> 3032.96
viable model for a computer

3030.559 --> 3036.0
self-creating system

3032.96 --> 3036.559
but it will just eventually run out of

3036.0 --> 3039.2
stuff

3036.559 --> 3041.0400000000004
to reproduce with and then leave a giant

3039.2 --> 3043.839
trash pile that's the consequence

3041.04 --> 3045.52
well humanity can actually bypass that

3043.839 --> 3048.64
by being

3045.52 --> 3052.8
inherently creative and being able to

3048.64 --> 3052.7999999999997
creatively deal with challenges as well

3052.96 --> 3058.079
without necessarily being instructed how

3055.68 --> 3062.24
to do so

3058.079 --> 3062.2400000000002
people can figure things out by

3066.839 --> 3069.839
themselves

3073.599 --> 3078.8
are we recycling much yes definitely i

3076.079 --> 3078.8
do my best

3081.04 --> 3088.24
i know it's not as great it is

3085.119 --> 3097.839
made to think it is but it is

3088.24 --> 3097.839
better than the alternative

3101.599 --> 3105.44
and i think that by thinking more in

3104.0 --> 3109.04
recycling

3105.44 --> 3111.2000000000003
industrial wise not yeah it doesn't mean

3109.04 --> 3112.5589999999997
you have to make shitty products like oh

3111.2 --> 3115.5989999999997
because it has no no

3112.559 --> 3116.4
but you can just start to think in

3115.599 --> 3119.3590000000004
modules

3116.4 --> 3119.359
so you simply

3120.24 --> 3124.0789999999997
multi-function and that's kind of

3122.0 --> 3127.52
already with the bottle idea

3124.079 --> 3129.44
bottle recycling you standardize certain

3127.52 --> 3130.24
things and that makes it much more

3129.44 --> 3133.52
malleable

3130.24 --> 3137.1189999999997
for recycling and all that

3133.52 --> 3138.8
and yeah it's kind of a slow development

3137.119 --> 3143.28
process but eventually

3138.8 --> 3143.28
yields to great great efficiencies

3143.68 --> 3150.839
that are like very simple and that's

3146.88 --> 3153.839
what's really valuable development in my

3150.839 --> 3153.839
opinion

3161.359 --> 3166.0
right and well well what if a computer

3164.559 --> 3169.44
could simply be made that

3166.0 --> 3171.04
would stand the test of time

3169.44 --> 3172.8
because i think computers could be

3171.04 --> 3175.68
designed like that

3172.8 --> 3176.48
to literally like well like an

3175.68 --> 3181.839
interstellar

3176.48 --> 3181.839
last forever

3182.8 --> 3188.7200000000003
or yeah it's star trek two data was

3186.16 --> 3192.0789999999997
supposedly gonna last forever

3188.72 --> 3196.0
right it can technically be done

3192.079 --> 3198.4
it's just not being done for us

3196.0 --> 3199.28
maybe they even have their own like

3198.4 --> 3201.119
lifetime

3199.28 --> 3204.8
technology and they're just not sharing

3201.119 --> 3204.8
it because they're like bastards

3206.079 --> 3209.8390000000004
but on the other hand yeah would people

3208.4 --> 3211.839
now in the world

3209.839 --> 3213.359
not just throw that [ __ ] away because

3211.839 --> 3216.4
they're just used to that

3213.359 --> 3218.5589999999997
and so it's yeah you have to culturally

3216.4 --> 3220.4
realize also that yeah if you got

3218.559 --> 3222.2400000000002
technology that'll last a lifetime you

3220.4 --> 3225.2000000000003
have to respect it

3222.24 --> 3228.0
you can't just treat it like plastic

3225.2 --> 3228.0
wrapping paper

3231.68 --> 3239.44
yes agm i have watched some of that

3236.079 --> 3242.559
i think the third season so far

3239.44 --> 3245.359
seems better than the previous two

3242.559 --> 3247.0400000000004
but yeah just watched two episodes i

3245.359 --> 3249.44
think i don't know haven't really

3247.04 --> 3252.319
caught up if there are others i don't

3249.44 --> 3255.599
know haven't seen it

3252.319 --> 3255.599
don't spoil it

3262.839 --> 3265.839
alright

3266.24 --> 3269.68
moore's law rtx what what are you

3268.88 --> 3272.319
talking about

3269.68 --> 3272.319
mike fox

3276.96 --> 3281.76
antiques era device thousands of years

3280.16 --> 3285.44
old yeah yeah

3281.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
yeah it is it's a

3285.44 --> 3293.839
a gear based computer fascinating

3318.839 --> 3325.359
right

3321.599 --> 3325.3590000000004
a quadro graphics what

3326.799 --> 3330.559
what are you gonna do with that that's

3329.68 --> 3334.319
really cute

3330.559 --> 3337.28
i know but

3334.319 --> 3337.2799999999997
yeah like

3337.68 --> 3342.16
yeah if you want to be in some amazing

3339.92 --> 3344.16
3d situation or whatever that's really

3342.16 --> 3346.0
nice a graphics card like that or if you

3344.16 --> 3349.2
want to have like this high

3346.0 --> 3350.319
tech futurist 3d modeling interface

3349.2 --> 3352.5589999999997
whatever with

3350.319 --> 3354.88
monitors all around you yeah that's very

3352.559 --> 3354.88
cute

3355.68 --> 3358.72
i guess that would be a worthwhile

3357.359 --> 3361.68
investment

3358.72 --> 3362.0
if you're like a 3d designer and you're

3361.68 --> 3365.359
doing

3362.0 --> 3366.48
really well i don't really have a use

3365.359 --> 3369.839
for such a card

3366.48 --> 3371.839
i'd like things to last forever be good

3369.839 --> 3375.68
enough for what i do

3371.839 --> 3377.52
still support games because i don't want

3375.68 --> 3382.16
the super super flashy

3377.52 --> 3382.16
immersed 3d games i don't like that

3382.96 --> 3388.839
and yeah last a long time and preferably

3386.64 --> 3390.24
have very little sound and noise and

3388.839 --> 3393.359
heat

3390.24 --> 3395.359
and just does not cost me as much

3393.359 --> 3398.48
electricity

3395.359 --> 3398.48
that's what i prefer

3399.92 --> 3405.839
and i got one my computer is absolutely

3402.839 --> 3405.839
great

3406.26 --> 3411.2000000000003
[Music]

3408.079 --> 3414.799
and i know that on average like i at

3411.2 --> 3417.2
max use what is it like five percent of

3414.799 --> 3422.88
its capacity

3417.2 --> 3422.8799999999997
so i don't even really challenge my

3430.839 --> 3433.839
computer

3434.799 --> 3438.72
right yeah i'm gonna round out the show

3436.799 --> 3440.72
so thanks everyone for coming

3438.72 --> 3442.48
i hope you like this show i thought it

3440.72 --> 3443.1189999999997
was pretty good a little bit over the

3442.48 --> 3446.64
place but

3443.119 --> 3448.7200000000003

number 710

3482.16 --> 3485.359
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

3483.44 --> 3488.079
debates right after this

3485.359 --> 3490.48
should start up any second now hashtag

3488.079 --> 3493.92
mifa indeed rob h

3490.48 --> 3496.88
omoko and dank and

3493.92 --> 3497.92
until oh here we go again and until the

3496.88 --> 3502.4300000000003
