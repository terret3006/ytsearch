this week

it's at least something

172.16 --> 177.12
but still i need to learn to get to bed

175.36 --> 179.68
quicker

177.12 --> 183.959
all right but yeah yesterday was was a

179.68 --> 183.959
really weird ending of the day

190.8 --> 195.59900000000002
because yeah sean hawkins did like a

195.84 --> 199.84
another review show

200.8 --> 205.84
of yeah of my show

203.36 --> 208.56
but it was really

205.84 --> 211.44
it was hilarious

208.56 --> 213.36
because he was he was trying to oh arwen

211.44 --> 215.599
oh why don't you just come back to the

213.36 --> 215.59900000000002
boy

215.68 --> 221.519
so preposterous

218.48 --> 221.51899999999998
but yeah

221.76 --> 227.84
i even told him like dude

224.239 --> 227.84
you don't know what you're doing

228.239 --> 233.20000000000002
you're falling for my trap and he did he

231.44 --> 235.92
just full in

233.2 --> 237.51899999999998
fell for it and that's all okay here's

235.92 --> 240.0
why

237.519 --> 242.56
i got major amounts of paypal donation

240.0 --> 242.56
yesterday

243.68 --> 246.799
and

244.879 --> 249.84
well major

246.799 --> 250.959
it's not like record amounts

249.84 --> 255.32
but still

250.959 --> 257.04
like sean gave me like 15 euros

255.32 --> 259.68
demonstratively

257.04 --> 262.16
he was first acting like oh yeah i'm so

259.68 --> 264.56
wealthy so wealthy oh wow so you can

262.16 --> 266.47900000000004
miss a whole 15 euros but

264.56 --> 268.639
still appreciate it even though it's

266.479 --> 271.59999999999997
coming from sean

268.639 --> 271.6
but another guy

272.0 --> 277.199
known as nerdy ee

274.24 --> 281.36
apparently i banned him some time ago

277.199 --> 281.36
but he gave me like 80 euros

281.68 --> 287.6
he said he was still following my show

284.4 --> 290.15999999999997
despite the philosophical differences

287.6 --> 292.40000000000003
and being banned so that was like what

290.16 --> 292.40000000000003
okay

295.759 --> 298.56
it was weird

301.199 --> 305.759
but yeah funny and

303.84 --> 307.84
i guess helpful

305.759 --> 310.84000000000003
because i yeah definitely can use the

307.84 --> 310.84
money

311.28 --> 316.96
for reasons that i mentioned on my show

313.28 --> 316.96
yesterday hello good servant

319.12 --> 324.36
and so yeah

321.12 --> 324.36
that happened

327.36 --> 329.68
ah

334.08 --> 336.4
right

346.16 --> 348.96000000000004
also

347.28 --> 350.84
watched like

348.96 --> 354.71999999999997
i was listening to

350.84 --> 357.039
basically video game music

354.72 --> 359.84000000000003
like of the game that i'm playing i i

357.039 --> 361.36
really am starting to appreciate some

359.84 --> 363.039
parts of it

361.36 --> 367.759
more and more and then through some

363.039 --> 371.36
recommendation from youtube linked to a

367.759 --> 374.319
live guitar classical concert and

371.36 --> 376.96000000000004
lasting an hour that was really

374.319 --> 379.52000000000004
impressive actually

376.96 --> 382.56
and it was recent as well it's like just

379.52 --> 384.79999999999995
a few days ago

382.56 --> 384.8
so

387.68 --> 392.319
it's funny sometimes youtube does

390.4 --> 394.4
recommend things that are actually

392.319 --> 397.28000000000003
really interesting that i wouldn't even

394.4 --> 397.28
think of looking

406.84 --> 411.039
up hello nathan oakley

412.4 --> 418.599

414.88 --> 418.599

468.72 --> 474.0
with a numpty clip i i first i didn't

471.84 --> 478.63899999999995
think it was a numpty clip but

474.0 --> 481.84
it did turn out to be one

478.639 --> 481.84000000000003
that was pretty hilarious

484.24 --> 490.0
jim bob went also alive

487.039 --> 492.639
but yeah i missed that in favor of

490.0 --> 495.44
kiwi no wait that's not entirely true i

492.639 --> 498.56

495.44 --> 500.8

501.199 --> 504.08

yesterday but i really appreciate that

815.36 --> 820.12
hope it helps oh yeah it does absolutely

842.639 --> 847.519
i mean every

844.48 --> 847.519
every bit helps

847.68 --> 852.0
as long as there is

849.12 --> 856.36
relatively constant influx then

852.0 --> 856.36
yeah that works out great

873.76 --> 878.279
oh

875.279 --> 878.279
oops

890.56 --> 895.4799999999999
i have to get some credit what

898.16 --> 901.88
but i do get credit

933.04 --> 937.079
i don't know

934.079 --> 937.079
okay

942.399 --> 945.959
oh we'll see

956.16 --> 959.4399999999999
man

957.519 --> 963.36
yeah i'm really starting to take notice

959.44 --> 965.36
that i don't really feel all that great

963.36 --> 969.12
not like sick it's just i think it's

965.36 --> 972.72
probably this type of weather

969.12 --> 972.72
i feel a little squeezy

978.959 --> 982.68
it would break

988.079 --> 991.8
oh right the rope

1003.92 --> 1009.16
well steamy traveler i don't know about

1006.16 --> 1009.16
that

1018.0 --> 1021.0
uh

1025.6 --> 1031.1989999999998
i think that the main component of that

1029.039 --> 1034.64
flat earth debate show going is still

1031.199 --> 1034.64
going to be nathan oakley

1034.959 --> 1040.4
right it is his show

1037.28 --> 1045.039
is who keeps it together

1040.4 --> 1045.039
i do my best to contribute it to it

1051.44 --> 1054.799
when i'm on there that is

1065.28 --> 1067.84
all right

1071.44 --> 1076.3200000000002
but yeah i appreciate the compliments

1073.76 --> 1076.32
guys i do

1077.2 --> 1083.6000000000001
right and just because yesterday's show

1080.0 --> 1083.6
had parts with outrage

1084.64 --> 1089.3600000000001
that doesn't mean that everything

1086.48 --> 1093.24
suddenly changed because of that

1089.36 --> 1093.24
it's not the first time

1098.48 --> 1103.52
right and yeah indeed the big chunk of

1101.44 --> 1104.559
the criticism was to the community in

1103.52 --> 1106.799
general

1104.559 --> 1108.6399999999999
because i do worry

1106.799 --> 1110.72
about flat earth

1108.64 --> 1113.76
in the sense the people

1110.72 --> 1115.6000000000001
i worry about them i worry about where

1113.76 --> 1118.72
people

1115.6 --> 1120.84
go towards with their behavior as they

1118.72 --> 1124.08
go through the flat

1120.84 --> 1128.9189999999999
earth and like the group the group

1124.08 --> 1128.9189999999999
behavior i worry about these things

1149.28 --> 1151.84
okay

1174.24 --> 1182.6
let's drop star trek this is stupid

1179.28 --> 1182.6
what idols

1192.559 --> 1196.6399999999999
like

1193.36 --> 1197.9189999999999
what idol seriously

1196.64 --> 1201.3600000000001
i am not

1197.919 --> 1202.72
idolizing him i'm simply trying to avoid

1201.36 --> 1203.84
people

1202.72 --> 1204.88
treating

1203.84 --> 1207.12
him

1204.88 --> 1211.0800000000002
like absolute garbage because i don't

1207.12 --> 1211.08
think he deserves that

1220.72 --> 1224.96
it's not an eye that's not idolizing

1233.28 --> 1237.8999999999999
like tell me how i've idolized him why

1236.24 --> 1239.1200000000001
don't you tell me exactly

1237.9 --> 1242.0800000000002
[Music]

1239.12 --> 1245.1999999999998
what i have done in the recent week that

1242.08 --> 1247.6
idolizes him tell me

1245.2 --> 1250.159
right i know you probably in your mind

1247.6 --> 1253.039
have that you think that i'm doing that

1250.159 --> 1257.4
why don't you show it

1253.039 --> 1257.4
why don't you prove that i am

1272.72 --> 1277.84
you give him credit for brainwashing

1275.6 --> 1277.84
what

1288.24 --> 1292.799
shatner should be in jail what the hell

1296.24 --> 1299.559
on what

1313.84 --> 1319.12
all right let's go to jail for

1316.08 --> 1321.12
gaslighting hello

1319.12 --> 1324.3999999999999
hello

1321.12 --> 1328.799
you realize we live in the world right

1324.4 --> 1332.159
and not some ridiculous little dream

1328.799 --> 1335.2
doesn't work like that

1332.159 --> 1338.3600000000001
go to jail for gaslighting what the hell

1335.2 --> 1338.3600000000001
it's ridiculous

1351.44 --> 1354.3200000000002
this is what i mean

1354.919 --> 1359.96
exaggerated response is ridiculous

1363.84 --> 1368.48
oh yeah do we oh you've been there have

1366.24 --> 1368.48
you

1369.679 --> 1373.919
no i'm not gonna have this discussion

1371.6 --> 1376.1589999999999
especially now because i don't really

1373.919 --> 1380.5200000000002
feel all that great

1376.159 --> 1380.5200000000002
but this is it's outrageous

1406.32 --> 1410.3999999999999
oh look who's talking service day look

1408.96 --> 1412.48
who's talking

1410.4 --> 1414.88
so you know him

1412.48 --> 1416.96
freaking out over this

1414.88 --> 1420.919
this is ridiculous look at what you're

1416.96 --> 1420.919
literally saying yourself

1430.32 --> 1436.039
should be getting a medal for real i

1432.159 --> 1436.0390000000002
wouldn't go that far

1468.72 --> 1473.3600000000001
oh no

1470.0 --> 1476.0
oh well we can't think that right how

1473.36 --> 1477.76
dare you think that shatner actually

1476.0 --> 1480.559
went up like

1477.76 --> 1482.4
are you actually listening to what

1480.559 --> 1483.6789999999999
you're saying

1482.4 --> 1485.3600000000001
why

1483.679 --> 1488.72
why

1485.36 --> 1492.0
why does that matter why do you care so

1488.72 --> 1494.88
much this is ridiculous

1492.0 --> 1497.52
you're literally

1494.88 --> 1499.5200000000002
like finding it a hill to die on and

1497.52 --> 1502.559
nobody cares

1499.52 --> 1504.8799999999999
this is ridiculous

1502.559 --> 1506.72
what are you doing why

1504.88 --> 1509.679
like oh is this

1506.72 --> 1512.08
the final nail in the coffin the final

1509.679 --> 1515.679
god contract well if you believe that

1512.08 --> 1518.8799999999999
shatner went up oh my god

1515.679 --> 1522.159
like are you listening to yourself man

1518.88 --> 1522.159
this is ridiculous

1525.279 --> 1531.039
yeah you are out out of your mind if you

1528.64 --> 1532.7990000000002
really think like this you're not

1531.039 --> 1536.24
right

1532.799 --> 1536.24
if that's really what you think

1537.12 --> 1542.6789999999999
like as in thinking that it matters so

1539.679 --> 1542.679
much

1561.2 --> 1565.8400000000001
why does defending shatner matter to you

1564.559 --> 1567.52
well

1565.84 --> 1570.48
let me get

1567.52 --> 1572.96
very typical and revert back to an old

1570.48 --> 1574.08
story

1572.96 --> 1577.3600000000001
about

1574.08 --> 1579.84
not defending people

1577.36 --> 1582.559
when injustice is done

1579.84 --> 1584.559
generally in general

1582.559 --> 1587.12
right especially like if you're part of

1584.559 --> 1590.3999999999999
a group and you notice that your group

1587.12 --> 1592.8799999999999
is misbehaving or getting crazy that's

1590.4 --> 1596.48
bad for your group you should stand up

1592.88 --> 1599.3600000000001
for that not to necessarily even defend

1596.48 --> 1602.08
the the guy

1599.36 --> 1603.6
being mistreated as much

1602.08 --> 1605.9189999999999
although yeah there's something to say

1603.6 --> 1608.0
for that but it's just like hello what

1605.919 --> 1609.3600000000001
is the what the hell is up with this

1608.0 --> 1613.08
behavior

1609.36 --> 1613.08
this is crazy

1613.12 --> 1616.4799999999998
why do you care

1617.279 --> 1622.4
why are you like almost making this

1619.679 --> 1625.4
political it is preposterous and

1622.4 --> 1625.4
pathetic

1640.72 --> 1645.44
right and i have reasons to kind of like

1643.2 --> 1649.1200000000001
the guy

1645.44 --> 1652.96
and this these reasons are personal

1649.12 --> 1652.9599999999998
it's because of his character

1653.52 --> 1658.48
and

1655.039 --> 1658.48
well that is just still

1658.559 --> 1664.08
active he's still being himself

1662.159 --> 1664.88
he's not just some

1664.08 --> 1668.4399999999998
yeah

1664.88 --> 1668.44
walking dead

1669.039 --> 1674.64
yeah being a slave to the machine he's

1671.279 --> 1677.96
actually doing stuff

1674.64 --> 1677.96
for him

1682.559 --> 1687.36
i yeah

1684.559 --> 1689.12
i i don't feel well enough to explain it

1687.36 --> 1691.52
correctly

1689.12 --> 1693.6
it's just that

1691.52 --> 1694.6399999999999
it's ridiculous why don't you just let

1693.6 --> 1697.84
this

1694.64 --> 1697.8400000000001
be what it is

1700.0 --> 1703.559
and move on

1735.52 --> 1741.2
it it's almost like you're so

1738.799 --> 1743.52
getting used to the psychological

1741.2 --> 1745.1200000000001
warfare and the gaslighting that is

1743.52 --> 1746.6399999999999
happening out there with great

1745.12 --> 1749.4399999999998
percentages

1746.64 --> 1752.5590000000002
it is predominant it is very invasive it

1749.44 --> 1754.3990000000001
is troubling it is punishing

1752.559 --> 1756.0
and you've become

1754.399 --> 1758.559
afraid

1756.0 --> 1761.2
to accept that some things might

1758.559 --> 1765.44
actually be real

1761.2 --> 1769.52
that's fear of reality you understand

1765.44 --> 1772.3990000000001
fear of something being real

1769.52 --> 1776.679
now that's a very troublesome sign

1772.399 --> 1776.6789999999999
to display that behavior

1801.36 --> 1806.1589999999999
okay sicarius well if he's so

1804.159 --> 1808.5590000000002
insignificant in your life why did you

1806.159 --> 1811.2
just spend

1808.559 --> 1814.8799999999999
several minutes trying to convince me to

1811.2 --> 1814.88
think about him in a certain way

1814.96 --> 1819.799
that seems a bit

1816.799 --> 1819.799
contradicting

1830.96 --> 1837.32
who's the solar panel i have no idea

1833.44 --> 1837.3200000000002
what you're talking about bry

1857.64 --> 1861.5490000000002
[Music]

1867.84 --> 1873.9599999999998
yeah it's a garage you're projecting

1869.76 --> 1873.96
dude you really are

1895.279 --> 1898.279
so

1915.279 --> 1918.919
yeah thank you cbs

1920.88 --> 1924.88
it's not even about honesty right i'm

1922.96 --> 1927.2
not excluding that it could have been

1924.88 --> 1929.919
faked i've

1927.2 --> 1933.919
i've laid it out it's just that

1929.919 --> 1935.4
i don't see him doing that at this point

1933.919 --> 1936.7990000000002
so depressing

1935.4 --> 1939.6000000000001
[Music]

1936.799 --> 1941.9189999999999
if it was all just fake just completely

1939.6 --> 1944.32
and it didn't go anywhere that's just

1941.919 --> 1947.6000000000001
depressing

1944.32 --> 1950.6399999999999
like where he's getting this

1947.6 --> 1953.12
this wind energy the second wind energy

1950.64 --> 1956.3200000000002
from he did just get a whole bunch of

1953.12 --> 1957.12
boosts from what you would get if you

1956.32 --> 1960.0
did

1957.12 --> 1962.4799999999998
a somewhat risky real life experience

1960.0 --> 1963.519
for the first time

1962.48 --> 1967.84
right

1963.519 --> 1967.84
you get energy from that from the kick

1967.919 --> 1972.3990000000001
like what he's gonna fake that all of

1970.159 --> 1972.3990000000001
that

1972.72 --> 1976.6000000000001
that's just so odd

1998.72 --> 2003.559
yeah that's right seeking star wars it

2000.559 --> 2003.559
is

2009.039 --> 2012.039
so

2030.799 --> 2035.48
i actors gonna act of course they are

2059.839 --> 2061.919
you

2082.24 --> 2085.24
do

2097.2 --> 2102.8799999999997
well it's a curious if i

2099.839 --> 2104.72
was like responsible for my own home in

2102.88 --> 2107.839
a direct sense and i'm not right now

2104.72 --> 2107.839
because i'm renting

2107.92 --> 2111.52
yeah

2109.359 --> 2114.64
then i would learn their names

2111.52 --> 2118.56
of the people that i would

2114.64 --> 2122.0789999999997
hire to to like do jobs or whatever

2118.56 --> 2122.0789999999997
unless i did it all myself

2124.8 --> 2126.96
of

2128.839 --> 2135.7599999999998
course it's ridiculous no no you're a

2132.16 --> 2135.7599999999998
wanker sargarius

2141.68 --> 2148.56
you are ridiculous

2144.88 --> 2151.76
for a guy who doesn't care at all

2148.56 --> 2154.7599999999998
you're really bizarre and obsessed over

2151.76 --> 2154.76
this

2205.28 --> 2210.2400000000002
did they saw the orb yeah shatner did

2207.76 --> 2211.3590000000004
apparently say that

2210.24 --> 2215.04
in

2211.359 --> 2217.04
like a news interview set up later

2215.04 --> 2218.88
he didn't say it upon

2217.04 --> 2223.16
yeah the original

2218.88 --> 2223.1600000000003
exiting of the capsule though

2228.32 --> 2231.599
all right but yeah he actually mentioned

2230.48 --> 2234.839
it once

2231.599 --> 2234.839
one time

2296.079 --> 2301.8390000000004
oh it's bad oh these people in their

2299.76 --> 2303.28
silly

2301.839 --> 2305.7599999999998
behavior

2303.28 --> 2307.8390000000004
so what you want to stop it you want to

2305.76 --> 2310.2400000000002
forbid all that

2307.839 --> 2312.96
so that you can force these people from

2310.24 --> 2315.4399999999996
stop

2312.96 --> 2318.16
with the auto entertainment the ice

2315.44 --> 2321.52
cream is as you say

2318.16 --> 2321.52
what you're gonna stop them

2321.599 --> 2328.079
like get real man get real

2326.56 --> 2330.7999999999997
why don't you just worry about what

2328.079 --> 2330.8
you're doing

2331.28 --> 2335.28
with your life

2333.599 --> 2337.92
what you allow

2335.28 --> 2342.079
yourself to get distracted by and stop

2337.92 --> 2344.7200000000003
worrying about what like dumb

2342.079 --> 2347.04
full autopilot people out there are

2344.72 --> 2347.04
doing

2347.599 --> 2352.4
and like getting concerned with trying

2350.16 --> 2355.72
to force them to stop that

2352.4 --> 2355.7200000000003
you can't
