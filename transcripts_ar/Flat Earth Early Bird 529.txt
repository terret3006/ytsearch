good to see you all

248.57 --> 270.06
Tuesday so yeah I I went to bed very

262.5 --> 272.97
early actually but yeah what's a bit of

270.06 --> 276.42
a weird night I went to bed early but I

272.97 --> 282.03000000000003
got up early but kind of stayed in bed I

276.42 --> 283.56
felt I don't know but I feel a lot

282.03 --> 285.39
better now it's like I started out

283.56 --> 293.52
waking up in the morning and just felt

285.39 --> 298.56
like mmm weird out of place I also had

293.52 --> 303.0
some yeah weird more superfluous type of

298.56 --> 306.39
dreams also along side that there now

303.0 --> 310.98
why is just dreams it it was very odd it

306.39 --> 315.78
was like I'm like I was talking with

310.98 --> 318.66
other people like kind of like wealthy

315.78 --> 320.64
people that I don't know and we were

318.66 --> 322.77000000000004
talking about cars and just walking

320.64 --> 325.05
around cars and they were saying like oh

322.77 --> 327.09
no this is such a stupid model yeah it

325.05 --> 329.1
may look good but it's not good at all

327.09 --> 331.84999999999997
and listen that it was a weird

329.1 --> 336.78000000000003
experience it's like something that I

331.85 --> 340.02000000000004
don't know maybe I had actually

336.78 --> 341.58
experienced that in the past but with my

340.02 --> 342.59999999999997
conscious mind at that time it didn't

341.58 --> 344.729
mean anything to me

342.6 --> 346.91900000000004
or maybe something like that is in the

344.729 --> 349.95
future because it was there were just

346.919 --> 352.37
moments where the visuals like really

349.95 --> 354.99
manifested touchably and there was some

352.37 --> 357.12
there was some light in there it wasn't

354.99 --> 360.06
really like a dark world type of

357.12 --> 362.31
experience but yeah I don't know

360.06 --> 365.85
fascinating when I I remembered that I

362.31 --> 367.86
had dreams but these types of dreams

365.85 --> 372.93
often are very superfluous although they

367.86 --> 375.96000000000004
feel good like it is good when I dream

372.93 --> 378.2
even though from a conscious perspective

375.96 --> 381.66999999999996
sometimes it doesn't really mean a lot

378.2 --> 386.95
also I took extra big doses of

381.67 --> 388.45
fish oil and vitamin C yesterday I guess

386.95 --> 390.28
it might also have to do just with

388.45 --> 393.31
another cycle my body is going through

390.28 --> 394.63
I've been having some minor issues with

393.31 --> 398.83
my jaw

394.63 --> 400.63
it hasn't really like before sometimes

398.83 --> 402.58
it does when it comes back it gets

400.63 --> 404.46999999999997
really painful and [ __ ] well it hasn't

402.58 --> 406.81
really become painful but it is like

404.47 --> 411.04
yeah there is something happening here I

406.81 --> 413.26
just feel a bit off sometimes and I

411.04 --> 415.6
thought therefore let's take vitamin C

413.26 --> 417.82
right before I go to bed put some extra

415.6 --> 420.1
fish oil on top of that it does feel

417.82 --> 421.48
somewhat better today so the other

420.1 --> 426.40000000000003
comfortable feeling this morning may

421.48 --> 428.49
also have to do with yeah kind of my

426.4 --> 433.27
body taking care of some inflammation

428.49 --> 438.36
situation and I have been very much

433.27 --> 442.77
burden also by my hay fever like a lot

438.36 --> 445.6
it's like I get sneezes all the time now

442.77 --> 447.03999999999996
outside especially and I'm not the only

445.6 --> 448.87
one by the way the other people that I

447.04 --> 450.37
know that are also constantly just

448.87 --> 452.98
sneezing how to know where it sniffy

450.37 --> 454.9
they're they're not there they don't

452.98 --> 463.15000000000003
really have a cold very obviously they

454.9 --> 465.28
know that oh yeah I star so much toxins

463.15 --> 467.04999999999995
in my jaw okay Gideon's sick that you

465.28 --> 469.47999999999996
shouldn't do that I don't know exactly

467.05 --> 473.2
what you mean whenever I brush my teeth

469.48 --> 475.12
very carefully and floss and all that

473.2 --> 477.84999999999997
and I know very much how to do that it

475.12 --> 480.45
like for me it's not just keeping it

477.85 --> 484.66
clean oh it is like maintenance and I

480.45 --> 487.57
have a in my mind a virtual architecture

484.66 --> 491.35
of what is going on here very dude it's

487.57 --> 493.96
like a dentist without dental surgery

491.35 --> 496.21000000000004
capability I know a lot of about what

493.96 --> 500.90999999999997
what's happening here and how to deal

496.21 --> 503.79999999999995
with it and yeah because I had to

500.91 --> 506.47
otherwise I'd be constantly going to the

503.8 --> 509.669
dentist and all that [ __ ] if I hadn't

506.47 --> 517.32
taken that up on myself

509.669 --> 523.529
mmm hey I kill the hope that's my body

517.32 --> 531.089
or moving the toxin right now for me

523.529 --> 535.76
it's just a yeah it's just a place here

531.089 --> 535.7600000000001
yeah that's just where that happens Oh

537.019 --> 544.8
Jeffrey Bell hello dude

543.029 --> 546.81
you should really check yourself when

544.8 --> 548.8199999999999
every single sentence you put out in

546.81 --> 551.399
chats has the word squirt in it just

548.82 --> 555.12
saying Jeffrey Bell I know it's a very

551.399 --> 560.579
funny word but this is pay attention to

555.12 --> 564.75
yourself there mmm right anyway yeah an

560.579 --> 568.62
odd little kroehner situation this

564.75 --> 570.6
morning I went to the store there was a

568.62 --> 573.35
man and he was like carrying this big

570.6 --> 577.47
you came from the organic store as well

573.35 --> 579.1800000000001
an older man like yeah was 65 Fred had

577.47 --> 582.779
some tattoos like on his face it was

579.18 --> 588.329
weird I was he was like trying to fit a

582.779 --> 590.31
big bag of dirt in his bag of his bike

588.329 --> 591.9899999999999
and he was like it wasn't working out so

590.31 --> 594.0
I was like hey let me help you

591.99 --> 596.55
let me hold that up and he was like no

594.0 --> 599.279
no take your distance the corona it's

596.55 --> 600.8599999999999
like I was like shocked like dude I

599.279 --> 604.079
tried to help you

600.86 --> 606.35
he's like yeah I know he immediately

604.079 --> 613.3499999999999
said like I know you don't believe that

606.35 --> 616.8290000000001
but I'm 65 like what it's like no that's

613.35 --> 622.5600000000001
that's not how that works that's not how

616.829 --> 624.3
you get like so yeah I had to kind of

622.56 --> 627.4799999999999
step away but I felt like almost

624.3 --> 632.8389999999999
insulted because I was just trying to be

627.48 --> 632.839
a good Samaritan and help a man you know

634.67 --> 639.63
and they thought like okay that like a

637.11 --> 641.64
bearded guy with the with the tattoo and

639.63 --> 643.83
all that like yeah he's not gonna take

641.64 --> 646.4399999999999
[ __ ] right he's not gonna be full but

643.83 --> 653.5200000000001
but no he was he wasn't wearing a mask

646.44 --> 657.5300000000001
oh it's just like what really under oval

653.52 --> 661.92
elderly are more vulnerable yeah - what

657.53 --> 664.8199999999999
I'm not sick and you don't catch a virus

661.92 --> 668.13
from people that have hay fever either

664.82 --> 675.33
and I wasn't sneezing even or anything

668.13 --> 677.88
at the time you cannot pick up old folk

675.33 --> 682.1700000000001
if they fall yeah that's ridiculous on a

677.88 --> 684.9
plane no you should definitely catch old

682.17 --> 686.7299999999999
people when they stumble and are

684.9 --> 689.4599999999999
threatening to fall even if they get

686.73 --> 694.32
pissed off afterward because yeah they

689.46 --> 698.0600000000001
are just brainwashed then you know we

694.32 --> 701.07
shouldn't take our just our social

698.06 --> 702.66
natural responsibilities away just

701.07 --> 705.75
because there's this ridiculous fear

702.66 --> 709.29
going on you know if they break

705.75 --> 712.08
something because they fall there much

709.29 --> 716.2199999999999
from in much more danger than if they

712.08 --> 723.1500000000001
would catch the sniffles you know that

716.22 --> 726.5600000000001
you gotta take that in mind all right

723.15 --> 726.56
hello stallion 8012

731.73 --> 738.999
they say yeah they say all kinds of

734.379 --> 743.9200000000001
crazy things but does any of that make

738.999 --> 747.61
sense I thought it was by the way really

743.92 --> 749.9799999999999
interesting the whole really interesting

747.61 --> 754.9300000000001
I thought it was like it was it was cool

749.98 --> 757.269
with David Icke having he's been working

754.93 --> 759.309
on some more streams hands on some

757.269 --> 765.309
interesting new interviews and all that

759.309 --> 767.29
and he's also yeah going yeah taking on

765.309 --> 769.7199999999999
the viruses taking on the concept of

767.29 --> 772.87
viruses and and assimilating that in his

769.72 --> 775.3290000000001
knowledge he really figured out yeah

772.87 --> 779.62
what viruses really are and what they're

775.329 --> 782.019
not and yeah it's cool it's cool to see

779.62 --> 785.35
that he he dares to go there you know

782.019 --> 787.12
because for him you know a lot of people

785.35 --> 789.309
have called David Icke a shell you know

787.12 --> 791.92
like some kind of control of position in

789.309 --> 794.439
reptilians and all that right but I

791.92 --> 801.279
don't the more times past the more I

794.439 --> 803.379
think that he yeah he has probably has

801.279 --> 806.319
gotten some connections and he has like

803.379 --> 809.1700000000001
tried out things but he's really just

806.319 --> 811.809
improvising like he's figuring it out as

809.17 --> 813.639
he goes as well in his own way and he's

811.809 --> 815.649
had his own shamanic experience he

813.639 --> 819.309
talked about it Kylie went to the

815.649 --> 825.42
Swahili shaman and all that and yeah big

819.309 --> 829.0
experiences so I really think that yeah

825.42 --> 829.93
he's still showing signs of real

829.0 --> 832.449
progress

829.93 --> 835.8
like real figuring out the next steps in

832.449 --> 843.25
certain in his own pace and that's good

835.8 --> 847.329
that's reassuring and now yeah so so so

843.25 --> 849.429
typical I still watch Alex Jones not

847.329 --> 851.679
really long usually but it just I always

849.429 --> 853.24
have to check it out and he even talked

851.679 --> 854.889
about this like yeah David Icke he's

853.24 --> 857.92
doing really good and I agree with

854.889 --> 861.769
everything he says but one thing and

857.92 --> 865.189
that is that viruses are a cleanup crew

861.769 --> 868.759
and Alex Jones definitely does not agree

865.189 --> 873.199
to that thinks that bad is why they take

868.759 --> 875.509
him down and look so yeah we definitely

873.199 --> 877.639
know where Alex stands you know Alex

875.509 --> 879.9490000000001
believes in the freaking globe no matter

877.639 --> 884.239
what and he definitely believes in

879.949 --> 890.41
viruses although at the same time he is

884.239 --> 893.799
also like still going with still

890.41 --> 896.779
recognizes the significance of the 5g

893.799 --> 900.35
situation needs even produce t-shirts

896.779 --> 902.749
about that all that so that's odd isn't

900.35 --> 904.61
it because when you consider like oh my

902.749 --> 906.739
roses are maybe secondary cleanup crew

904.61 --> 909.98
then the five G suddenly becomes more

906.739 --> 911.779
like a causal thing that could cause

909.98 --> 913.009
that you could approach it completely

911.779 --> 914.779
differently but he's kind of

913.009 --> 917.179
compartmentalize that apparently and

914.779 --> 927.679
says no viruses are real five G is also

917.179 --> 929.749
real okay right so yeah all these people

927.679 --> 932.569
out there they are making their choices

929.749 --> 936.98
they are choosing what to go with and

932.569 --> 942.579
what they aren't going with and it's

936.98 --> 945.649
just odd to see it all develop like that

942.579 --> 952.8499999999999
so yeah that's that was that yesterday

945.649 --> 954.529
also old Benjamin of course but yeah I

952.85 --> 956.66
should watch that back was with his

954.529 --> 959.54
mother again but D life was just cutting

956.66 --> 963.709
out on me like every two seconds it's so

959.54 --> 968.929
aggravating and yeah I barely caught

963.709 --> 971.52
five minutes told a lot of it so I

968.929 --> 974.5799999999999
didn't see much I hope it was good

971.52 --> 974.5799999999999
[Music]

977.54 --> 989.28
what Missouri bear are you talking about

981.86 --> 992.64
what's that what's that link Hey all

989.28 --> 996.06
right the nurse situation well I don't

992.64 --> 1002.51
know man I really don't know you know

996.06 --> 1004.7299999999999
you you I don't know about these these

1002.51 --> 1006.23
the situation with these new nurses

1004.73 --> 1012.62
saying that they're killing people like

1006.23 --> 1014.66
that you know it could be but you got to

1012.62 --> 1016.07
be very careful with this because you're

1014.66 --> 1019.73
gonna realize with everything that's

1016.07 --> 1023.98
gone down now like the weird dancing

1019.73 --> 1029.59
nurses and all that a lot still goes on

1023.98 --> 1032.96
this could be a plant it it could be

1029.59 --> 1034.2099999999998
that it's not really like that that

1032.96 --> 1037.28
they're just

1034.21 --> 1041.38
yeah the ventilators that I did hear

1037.28 --> 1044.32
about that it's it's a practical thing

1041.38 --> 1051.3400000000001
but to really say like no they are like

1044.32 --> 1056.51
knowingly killing them I know you know

1051.34 --> 1059.51
it's like that for example just compare

1056.51 --> 1062.03
the energy the stands the feel of the

1059.51 --> 1063.98
people that have come out that have done

1062.03 --> 1066.26
some really good revealing of

1063.98 --> 1067.7
information and all that which is what

1066.26 --> 1069.79
those people were like then compare it

1067.7 --> 1074.48
to for example this person you linked to

1069.79 --> 1079.37
kind of the way they look and I don't

1074.48 --> 1083.1100000000001
know you know this this person could

1079.37 --> 1083.11
simply be

1084.269 --> 1091.619
kind of trying to mess with us I'm not

1088.259 --> 1093.779
sure I don't have the the same deeper

1091.619 --> 1096.029
feeling of trust when I see this person

1093.779 --> 1099.529
I did haven't even listened to what they

1096.029 --> 1106.32
said the day that's that my preliminary

1099.529 --> 1110.029
so I'm not sure about it if she's fake

1106.32 --> 1113.49
then she's the best actress of all times

1110.029 --> 1116.84
okay well I guess I will have to watch

1113.49 --> 1120.269
it but it is like 23 24 minutes long

1116.84 --> 1122.82
just saying that I don't know man there

1120.269 --> 1127.159
could be some some trickery going down

1122.82 --> 1127.1589999999999
as well with this

1147.21 --> 1149.81
right

1150.41 --> 1158.93
okay okay Missouri bear well since you

1154.88 --> 1162.6200000000001
have watched the whole thing I will go

1158.93 --> 1167.51
with your analysis then and say that she

1162.62 --> 1169.34
probably is real and authentic I I was

1167.51 --> 1171.26
just more in general warning like

1169.34 --> 1173.27
there's bear more of these supposed

1171.26 --> 1175.25
nurses coming out with that type of

1173.27 --> 1178.52
setup like oh they're killing them and I

1175.25 --> 1180.14
just feel like now this there's

1178.52 --> 1186.08
something wrong about this

1180.14 --> 1190.4
it's just something feels off I I don't

1186.08 --> 1193.4299999999998
know maybe you know I could be wrong

1190.4 --> 1196.5700000000002
about that it just there's something go

1193.43 --> 1196.5700000000002
there's more going on

1212.21 --> 1220.58
right but maybe I'll study more into it

1215.48 --> 1224.3600000000001
I will definitely keep this clip hanging

1220.58 --> 1240.71
and watch it thank you Missouri Bear for

1224.36 --> 1243.309
link low good servant right viruses are

1240.71 --> 1243.309
not contagious

1251.23 --> 1257.78
[Music]

1253.28 --> 1260.27
it's a that's not how it works like I've

1257.78 --> 1264.8
even speculated about this pretty early

1260.27 --> 1268.37
on like viruses are not a a invading

1264.8 --> 1273.5
agent but the body can take the presence

1268.37 --> 1275.51
of virus as like a sign like hey there's

1273.5 --> 1279.26
a lot of these cleanup crew rounds

1275.51 --> 1286.19
that's could be a sign that we should

1279.26 --> 1288.98
also be doing that kind of thing and so

1286.19 --> 1290.99
yeah through like a resonant situation

1288.98 --> 1292.7
the body can and also through

1290.99 --> 1294.95
psychosomatic seeing people sneeze all

1292.7 --> 1299.72
the time and all that coughing really

1294.95 --> 1302.56
bad then yeah that could trigger an

1299.72 --> 1305.57
individual like by a central

1302.56 --> 1308.87
subconscious decision to basically start

1305.57 --> 1313.1899999999998
developing those symptoms as well to

1308.87 --> 1316.55
become effectively sick but it's not an

1313.19 --> 1319.25
invading agent that makes that decision

1316.55 --> 1321.53
it's rather like a management decision

1319.25 --> 1325.12
concerning what's going around I don't

1321.53 --> 1325.12
know it's just different

1330.51 --> 1336.82
hey guns have never run RMP yeah better

1334.63 --> 1339.5800000000002
late than never and thank you again man

1336.82 --> 1342.87
for the huge for the huge PayPal

1339.58 --> 1342.87
donation that's really awesome

1352.18 --> 1357.48
okay cars who are honking all over the

1354.91 --> 1357.48
place why is that

1361.809 --> 1367.479
all right I ride Missouri oh by the way

1364.419 --> 1372.759
I think I forgot to shout out a member

1367.479 --> 1373.269
somebody was it a Julia Pavan that's

1372.759 --> 1376.809
right

1373.269 --> 1378.7
Julia Pepin became a member earlier like

1376.809 --> 1381.869
10 minutes ago Thank You Julia premon

1378.7 --> 1381.8690000000001
for becoming a ranger

1394.93 --> 1398.92
my dad's got a cold at the moment I'm

1397.33 --> 1399.82
not worried and the least he's got a

1398.92 --> 1405.5800000000002
cold right

1399.82 --> 1409.1499999999999
Gideon's sick and look you could see it

1405.58 --> 1411.9099999999999
like this you know older people if they

1409.15 --> 1416.3200000000002
are also vulnerable to if they've always

1411.91 --> 1420.4
had issues with with hay fever then that

1416.32 --> 1423.1899999999998
could in some way compact a risk you

1420.4 --> 1426.88
know it's like especially with a lot of

1423.19 --> 1429.79
small hats yeah it's in the family you

1426.88 --> 1432.0400000000002
know that hey they often have hay fever

1429.79 --> 1434.8899999999999
and when you're old yet can become quite

1432.04 --> 1437.73
dangerous but there are quite easy

1434.89 --> 1440.8000000000002
effective things you can do against that

1437.73 --> 1442.84
situation against a compound at risk of

1440.8 --> 1448.44
hay fever with some kind of cold

1442.84 --> 1453.31
situation by taking quail egg shells

1448.44 --> 1455.56
from France yeah there's you can buy

1453.31 --> 1457.96
them powdered up in pills and all that

1455.56 --> 1461.1399999999999
it's a it's just the eggshells and it

1457.96 --> 1463.78
works it works perfectly against the hay

1461.14 --> 1468.01
fever situation in the body without any

1463.78 --> 1470.5
side effects really and yeah it's not

1468.01 --> 1473.3799999999999
even completely understood how it works

1470.5 --> 1477.31
but it's like the best working thing

1473.38 --> 1479.74
ever against it now unfortunately I

1477.31 --> 1482.6499999999999
don't have it right now I could have

1479.74 --> 1484.45
ordered it but it was just like no I

1482.65 --> 1486.4
don't have to budget I decided not to

1484.45 --> 1487.96
but I wish I had because then I'd have

1486.4 --> 1490.72
it now and I wouldn't have hay fever

1487.96 --> 1492.91
probably oh thank you my Dewayne

1490.72 --> 1494.95
Missouri bear for the twenty dollar ship

1492.91 --> 1497.17
chat donation enjoy your early bird show

1494.95 --> 1499.3600000000001
thanks Arwen well thank you Missouri

1497.17 --> 1501.94
Bear for being there and enjoying my

1499.36 --> 1505.6599999999999
show and yeah adding to the conversation

1501.94 --> 1509.1000000000001
and informing me also you know in a way

1505.66 --> 1514.3000000000002
I die also need you guys to inform me

1509.1 --> 1517.6299999999999
because I have my periods when I'm

1514.3 --> 1519.43
really diving into a lot when my mind is

1517.63 --> 1520.8100000000002
just like yeah more more more more more

1519.43 --> 1522.55
and their spirits when they kind of have

1520.81 --> 1523.23
to step back because it overwhelms me oh

1522.55 --> 1526.1399999999999
and that

1523.23 --> 1529.23
I kind of miss what's going around and I

1526.14 --> 1531.5400000000002
need all you guys to basically help me

1529.23 --> 1533.82
remind me and that way there yeah you

1531.54 --> 1536.309
got something to do and that way I don't

1533.82 --> 1538.1689999999999
have to like make notes of everything

1536.309 --> 1545.1789999999999
just to keep track of what's going on

1538.169 --> 1548.91
because my memory in general for I guess

1545.179 --> 1551.27
these types of things is not the best

1548.91 --> 1551.27
around

1551.63 --> 1557.73
like I remember essence of things and

1555.33 --> 1560.21
like changes and all that but as to the

1557.73 --> 1564.8700000000001
details of who said what who did what

1560.21 --> 1567.179
that kind of thing that is not my best

1564.87 --> 1571.1299999999999
talent that's not how my memory tends to

1567.179 --> 1575.7
work was always like that

1571.13 --> 1578.0100000000002
I thrive with other people around that I

1575.7 --> 1583.8500000000001
can use is a kind of a reflection board

1578.01 --> 1588.919
at it that's I always worked like that

1583.85 --> 1592.2199999999998
check my Friday night for PayPal ok

1588.919 --> 1592.22
Friday night

1597.19 --> 1608.409
what does that mean exactly Guns of

1601.029 --> 1611.229
Navarone eggshells are great seed

1608.409 --> 1615.3400000000001
starter pods that's interesting Robin

1611.229 --> 1620.1390000000001
Stanley the other eggshells are very

1615.34 --> 1624.749
good for ya for nourishing the ground

1620.139 --> 1624.7489999999998
basically for the plants it's good stuff

1630.11 --> 1635.58
but yeah with the the quail egg shells

1633.81 --> 1638.1499999999999
it's really it's not about the quail

1635.58 --> 1641.07
eggs themselves it's about the shells

1638.15 --> 1645.5700000000002
it's the grounded up shells that work so

1641.07 --> 1652.47
great to to basically suppress the all

1645.57 --> 1659.6299999999999
the effects of hay fever got a super jet

1652.47 --> 1659.63
from Zuri mare yeah I read it out

1669.09 --> 1674.149
what is it over McCall did I miss

1671.759 --> 1674.1490000000001
something

1686.76 --> 1693.73
yeah the red dragon yeah I I won I just

1691.24 --> 1699.13
well I got the camera somebody gave it

1693.73 --> 1702.73
to me and yeah I still have it and I

1699.13 --> 1707.5200000000002
have used it but yeah it's been sitting

1702.73 --> 1713.14
around recently collecting dust a little

1707.52 --> 1715.27
but it is still there and yeah the it's

1713.14 --> 1717.3700000000001
just that the setup for what I kind of

1715.27 --> 1719.8899999999999
wanted to do to get out there and all

1717.37 --> 1724.12
that is it's not complete yet I still

1719.89 --> 1726.73
need a battery loader because I do have

1724.12 --> 1731.4699999999998
like these spare batteries yes I know

1726.73 --> 1734.3700000000001
Randy gave it to me that's right and I

1731.47 --> 1734.3700000000001
thanked him for it

1738.86 --> 1742.9289999999999
so anything else in the red dragon

1772.34 --> 1777.09
mmm Missouri where okay so she had

1774.72 --> 1782.25
criticized did the nurse you're talking

1777.09 --> 1783.9599999999998
about the nurse from the video right

1782.25 --> 1789.15
dragon how does it compare to other

1783.96 --> 1791.82
cameras you have used well it's a very

1789.15 --> 1795.45
good camera as far as I've used it it is

1791.82 --> 1797.73
relatively easy in use the previous

1795.45 --> 1801.45
camera I had what that's like 10 years

1797.73 --> 1804.03
ago and it and it was also a good camera

1801.45 --> 1805.8600000000001
but I think that this one is much it's

1804.03 --> 1809.6
it's by far the best camera I've ever

1805.86 --> 1809.6
had for sure

1836.47 --> 1844.1000000000001
right right right James Mason

1840.26 --> 1849.31
yeah that's composting but technically

1844.1 --> 1856.55
it's better to have a separate compost

1849.31 --> 1859.61
place for that to let it well ferment

1856.55 --> 1863.27
rots in the right way before you

1859.61 --> 1867.29
actually put it into the ground because

1863.27 --> 1870.59
if you do it just raw like that then

1867.29 --> 1873.74
yeah that that doesn't work as

1870.59 --> 1876.53
effectively as far as I've learned from

1873.74 --> 1879.29
yeah that's what my parents used to say

1876.53 --> 1882.67
and do now they were not the most

1879.29 --> 1886.1299999999999
effective compost heap creators at it

1882.67 --> 1889.4
but they did progress like when they

1886.13 --> 1894.44
during the period because they were

1889.4 --> 1896.48
improvising a lot you know my parents or

1894.44 --> 1898.97
at least my mother mostly really with

1896.48 --> 1901.49
the house we had and the garden they

1898.97 --> 1905.69
really tried to be all organic and all

1901.49 --> 1909.44
that and smart and learning but yeah we

1905.69 --> 1911.51
were not the most the most advanced but

1909.44 --> 1913.0700000000002
we were growing and there was no

1911.51 --> 1914.6
internet yet you gotta remember that so

1913.07 --> 1917.36
it was released through people and

1914.6 --> 1922.25
through books and all that with much

1917.36 --> 1924.9799999999998
older sources but I kind of wit this

1922.25 --> 1927.2
that just happening and transforming

1924.98 --> 1929.69
over the ages as a kid I thought it was

1927.2 --> 1933.23
going to turn into in my mind that place

1929.69 --> 1936.98
was gonna turn into glorious castle so

1933.23 --> 1938.9
it was a real painful realization that

1936.98 --> 1940.49
it was basically going to be lost that

1938.9 --> 1942.3500000000001
the house was going to be sold because

1940.49 --> 1944.8700000000001
it was like a little paradise that my

1942.35 --> 1948.4099999999999
mother had made there and it was getting

1944.87 --> 1951.01
better and yeah it's unfortunately how

1948.41 --> 1951.01
things work

1956.82 --> 1959.9399999999998
[Music]

1963.94 --> 1972.0700000000002
uh Zuri bear manslaughter if you like

1967.75 --> 1976.179
right yeah at the nurse situation so she

1972.07 --> 1978.22
basically saw that there was a policy of

1976.179 --> 1980.8300000000002
doing things that was kind of reckless

1978.22 --> 1988.3500000000001
and she spoke out about it and then she

1980.83 --> 1991.33
was kind of pushed away so it is like a

1988.35 --> 1993.4599999999998
bureaucratic situation of mismanagement

1991.33 --> 1998.009
that's kind of what it sounds like to me

1993.46 --> 1998.009
so far from what you've told me

2020.64 --> 2023.64
yeah

2028.02 --> 2036.54
try not banana skins all right I guess I

2033.22 --> 2036.54
don't know about that

2044.25 --> 2049.57
you know I've heard about a this was

2047.74 --> 2051.31
turned at the time when I was with my

2049.57 --> 2055.119
ex-girlfriend because she was into that

2051.31 --> 2057.79
too oh god I wish that it would have

2055.119 --> 2061.29
worked out between us because she had so

2057.79 --> 2063.97
many interested that I just love just

2061.29 --> 2067.71
that let's not think about it too much

2063.97 --> 2071.7999999999997
but she discovered something about

2067.71 --> 2075.34
there's like certain type of worms that

2071.8 --> 2079.75
you could just keep in a bucket roughly

2075.34 --> 2083.889
and as long as you yeah throw in proper

2079.75 --> 2088.08
organic food waste then they can just

2083.889 --> 2095.25
keep on going and yeah they excrete like

2088.08 --> 2097.72
the most fertile amazing fertilizer ever

2095.25 --> 2100.09
so there was a whole new approach to a

2097.72 --> 2102.1
compost he basically just letting it all

2100.09 --> 2107.26
be eaten by worms in a controlled way

2102.1 --> 2108.7
and yeah I've never got to actually try

2107.26 --> 2112.3590000000004
it out but that sound extremely

2108.7 --> 2118.109
interesting bigger than snakes really

2112.359 --> 2118.109
Missouri bear that's crazy really

2125.32 --> 2131.02
our stables please all right horse

2128.44 --> 2132.76
stables free manure right but you got to

2131.02 --> 2135.46
let that ferment too you know

2132.76 --> 2140.5
don't forget about that it's all got to

2135.46 --> 2142.78
be properly fermented and you cannot

2140.5 --> 2146.53
like even with manure you can smell when

2142.78 --> 2148.63
there's something wrong about it and you

2146.53 --> 2151.51
can smell when it is readily from it it

2148.63 --> 2153.6400000000003
smells different I don't know I don't

2151.51 --> 2155.4100000000003
know if anybody's now people that have

2153.64 --> 2158.67
worked with that probably know that it's

2155.41 --> 2158.67
just something that I picked up

2176.93 --> 2185.33
pig the I would know with pig because

2181.52 --> 2189.61
yeah their excrement like sting so bad I

2185.33 --> 2189.61
I just want to stay away

2205.26 --> 2211.32
yeah that's one of the reasons why like

2208.47 --> 2213.45
I would never farm pigs you know I might

2211.32 --> 2217.2000000000003
have a peak but I would treat it more

2213.45 --> 2219.6189999999997
like a pet because if you have a lot of

2217.2 --> 2225.02
pigs man it's always gonna stink so bad

2219.619 --> 2228.78
it's like nothing compared like cows or

2225.02 --> 2232.92
chickens it's it's nothing compared to

2228.78 --> 2236.09
like how pigs freakin stink if yeah if

2232.92 --> 2236.09
there's a lot of them

2245.03 --> 2253.65
or yeah dude you know with the pig maybe

2247.71 --> 2256.7400000000002
also if if it's like a really really

2253.65 --> 2258.96
free-range setup for a pig that they

2256.74 --> 2262.02
have a lot of room I don't think that

2258.96 --> 2264.7200000000003
usually happens then the stink situation

2262.02 --> 2266.34
might also just go down a lot because I

2264.72 --> 2270.48
think that pigs do have like this

2266.34 --> 2272.75
tendency to be literally hygienic they

2270.48 --> 2277.38
like always poo in the same corner they

2272.75 --> 2279.0
they try to keep that separate from

2277.38 --> 2280.44
where they're hanging unlike most other

2279.0 --> 2285.21
animals that just drop wherever

2280.44 --> 2287.01
understand you know so yeah I could

2285.21 --> 2289.14
imagine that if you had a couple of pigs

2287.01 --> 2292.3500000000004
and they would have like a lot of room

2289.14 --> 2294.24
to like a huge amount of room to walk

2292.35 --> 2298.49
around and everything that there

2294.24 --> 2298.49
probably would not be so much Pig stink

2304.85 --> 2315.65
right yeah and sick pics are intelligent

2307.49 --> 2319.3999999999996
the actual bovine creatures and they

2315.65 --> 2320.96
have feelings very noticeably so they

2319.4 --> 2323.71
have character and feelings and all

2320.96 --> 2323.71
that's yeah

2334.14 --> 2339.8799999999997
hmm

2335.68 --> 2339.8799999999997
interesting piece sprays

2349.1 --> 2359.11
big pool bear house okay that's a funny

2356.36 --> 2359.11
one James Mason

2376.17 --> 2383.91
ah misery where did you get these giant

2381.96 --> 2387.599
worms Missouri but I've never heard of

2383.91 --> 2389.839
that then I guess your dogs likes to eat

2387.599 --> 2389.839
them

2413.83 --> 2419.69
decent herb garden in the window box

2416.72 --> 2425.359
well Robin sternly I do kind of have a

2419.69 --> 2427.91
decent herb garden I have them in small

2425.359 --> 2430.8489999999997
pots downstairs in the kitchen I

2427.91 --> 2432.77
basically claimed the window and hey

2430.849 --> 2436.78
everybody kind of seems to like it

2432.77 --> 2439.369
because I it's filled with my plants

2436.78 --> 2442.7000000000003
it's like the only plants really there

2439.369 --> 2446.0
and it does look nice I got like a lot

2442.7 --> 2448.16
of basil plants Oregon oh that's the

2446.0 --> 2449.48
Oregon Oh is completely blooming up

2448.16 --> 2452.75
there's like all these sprouts that

2449.48 --> 2455.0
reach up way like half a meter or

2452.75 --> 2457.04
something it's pretty incredible thought

2455.0 --> 2459.47
he was gonna just die out but didn't

2457.04 --> 2465.8
like got this giant burst

2459.47 --> 2471.8199999999997
I got a Laurel Laurel trees sprout type

2465.8 --> 2475.82
of situation going now some parsley

2471.82 --> 2478.46
right yeah and in a lot of basil plants

2475.82 --> 2480.26
like different generations like some

2478.46 --> 2483.2
basil plants are now two years old and

2480.26 --> 2485.98
they are on to their third blooming it's

2483.2 --> 2488.7799999999997
incredible like most of it is just gone

2485.98 --> 2492.14
but there's just keep on sprouting

2488.78 --> 2496.19
blooming flowers and all that pretty

2492.14 --> 2499.58
interesting so I'm keeping them all

2496.19 --> 2505.52
alive studying them just I'm studying it

2499.58 --> 2509.0299999999997
the life and the behavior and like just

2505.52 --> 2511.52
how that works also the influences of

2509.03 --> 2513.8590000000004
certain energy changes like in the

2511.52 --> 2518.119
atmosphere like people respond to that

2513.859 --> 2520.0099999999998
you know but I think plants also respond

2518.119 --> 2523.54
to that especially the plants that are

2520.01 --> 2525.8900000000003
directly taken care of by human beings

2523.54 --> 2527.72
because then indirectly when human

2525.89 --> 2530.1189999999997
beings are influenced everything that

2527.72 --> 2531.3689999999997
they influence also becomes influenced

2530.119 --> 2533.96
in a similar manner

2531.369 --> 2536.0
so it's all part of the studies of the

2533.96 --> 2539.7200000000003
energy and the workings of life for me

2536.0 --> 2542.12
and just having plants to take care of

2539.72 --> 2543.8599999999997
it I like it

2542.12 --> 2545.45
I always make sure they have plenty of

2543.86 --> 2554.3
water like even do it in the middle of

2545.45 --> 2560.2
the night if necessary they are stick as

2554.3 --> 2560.2000000000003
a big pen holy really man that's big

2563.12 --> 2568.909
[Music]

2569.78 --> 2585.71
so say they're like this big as the as

2579.09 --> 2585.71
wide as the the broadest part this pen

2619.599 --> 2626.2290000000003
no Guns of Navarone RB you don't have

2623.14 --> 2628.68
leprosy it's just it's kind of crowding

2626.229 --> 2628.68
my chair

2635.65 --> 2641.62
all right but where do those worms come

2639.19 --> 2647.68
from like huge earthworms I have never

2641.62 --> 2650.02
heard of that are they from some some

2647.68 --> 2652.2999999999997
country in Africa or South America or

2650.02 --> 2658.84
something don't think earthworms

2652.3 --> 2662.88
normally get that big where where are

2658.84 --> 2662.88
those types of worms originating from

2676.8 --> 2681.98
night crawl what what is that

2690.63 --> 2697.44
they were here when I got here unknown

2694.62 --> 2701.0099999999998
where they originated okay so you did

2697.44 --> 2703.9500000000003
not like important they just Wow

2701.01 --> 2706.1400000000003
so you just moved there and it appears

2703.95 --> 2709.29
you have these crazy large worms in the

2706.14 --> 2715.79
ground so they might have been native to

2709.29 --> 2715.79
the land you say that's fascinating

2731.9 --> 2738.44
Oh Missouri berry you know I'd love to

2736.46 --> 2743.18
have some of those maybe if I'd ever get

2738.44 --> 2748.509
a garden I'd love to have like a just a

2743.18 --> 2756.23
group of those huge worms and then yeah

2748.509 --> 2759.23
unleash them near a compost heap figure

2756.23 --> 2761.9
out like what is the best way to have

2759.23 --> 2763.88
yeah like make sure they don't get all

2761.9 --> 2765.559
pull out of the ground with the first

2763.88 --> 2770.089
opportunity the birds find out that

2765.559 --> 2771.049
they're there Mike crawlers are huge

2770.089 --> 2773.799
earthworms

2771.049 --> 2773.799
really

2781.56 --> 2787.21
are you talking about night crawlers in

2784.15 --> 2789.76
D&D now because yeah then I get what you

2787.21 --> 2793.87
mean now wait that night

2789.76 --> 2795.28
that's not never mind right okay it did

2793.87 --> 2797.73
know they were called night crawlers

2795.28 --> 2797.73
weird

2799.83 --> 2815.79
[Music]

2824.13 --> 2830.1
all right yeah Guns of Navarone that's

2826.65 --> 2833.0
true but it also depends just on the

2830.1 --> 2837.5699999999997
compactness of the ground you know

2833.0 --> 2839.55
because if it's really gonna oh yeah

2837.57 --> 2841.44
kind of get blocked and filled up with

2839.55 --> 2845.55
water yeah then the worm is gonna drown

2841.44 --> 2846.63
but if it's just a very lush space

2845.55 --> 2850.8300000000004
spacey

2846.63 --> 2852.9900000000002
type of ground then yeah they may go up

2850.83 --> 2855.21
a little but yeah they're never really

2852.99 --> 2857.1899999999996
gonna surface because they're not afraid

2855.21 --> 2861.62
of drowning because yeah the the ground

2857.19 --> 2861.62
can take up a lot of water like that

2871.569 --> 2877.63
like I think that especially if you have

2874.68 --> 2880.979
like ground coverings remember like

2877.63 --> 2886.1800000000003
based on a forest system where you have

2880.979 --> 2890.1299999999997
grounded up wood and leaves a certain

2886.18 --> 2892.8089999999997
type and you cover your soil with that I

2890.13 --> 2895.779
think that is very good for the worms

2892.809 --> 2901.0890000000004
too when you do that it's good for

2895.779 --> 2904.89
everything because basically if you just

2901.089 --> 2911.319
have the the black earth on the surface

2904.89 --> 2913.8689999999997
technically it is yeah it is like

2911.319 --> 2918.5389999999998
exposed it's almost like it has no skin

2913.869 --> 2922.2090000000003
it ground good ground really should have

2918.539 --> 2925.7490000000003
forest covering alike skin it's like

2922.209 --> 2928.66
part of the of the macro organism if

2925.749 --> 2930.819
it's just black exposed earth yeah it

2928.66 --> 2933.7889999999998
may look better you make you can see

2930.819 --> 2937.69
where there's like weeds starting to

2933.789 --> 2944.259
grow much easier and all that but it's

2937.69 --> 2946.539
overall not better for the ground if you

2944.259 --> 2947.499
have some forest like woodchips

2946.539 --> 2951.19
coverings

2947.499 --> 2952.839
the ground will stay a lot better yeah

2951.19 --> 2959.759
this is one of the things I learned from

2952.839 --> 2959.759
one of the channels talked about that

2960.53 --> 2965.05
is it again it's a really great video

2965.109 --> 2972.38
it's been a while ago since I talked

2967.34 --> 2975.79
about that yeah right they call that

2972.38 --> 2975.79
mulch do they Jim Jones

2993.359 --> 2997.4
right okay so that is mulch

3004.38 --> 3008.309
so mulch is not like composted ground

3007.44 --> 3012.119
right

3008.309 --> 3015.809
it is like the top covering layer you

3012.119 --> 3020.19
put over the ground right

3015.809 --> 3023.9990000000003
I don't know perfectly the terminologies

3020.19 --> 3026.13
the names that it all has yet but I got

3023.999 --> 3033.18
the process and yeah I got the visuals

3026.13 --> 3036.9
oh wait

3033.18 --> 3044.989
and what good mulch is what you do to

3036.9 --> 3044.989
group all right so I did get it right

3048.09 --> 3053.76
it's covering especially for frost

3050.58 --> 3057.29
ride-rite that also that the water in

3053.76 --> 3057.2900000000004
the ground doesn't freeze up so much

3057.98 --> 3067.52
okay so so that stuff is called mulch

3062.24 --> 3071.1
like the the wood chips type of covering

3067.52 --> 3074.61
so make it more in a forest ground skin

3071.1 --> 3077.73
situation okay okay I'll remember that

3074.61 --> 3087.44
I think we're did sound kind of familiar

3077.73 --> 3087.44
I wasn't sure anyway

3102.44 --> 3110.85
expense really getting sick of woodchips

3105.9 --> 3112.98
nice expense you mean expensive well

3110.85 --> 3115.2
that all depends you know what you're

3112.98 --> 3116.76
going to use as a source because from

3115.2 --> 3121.5899999999997
what I've heard depending on the region

3116.76 --> 3123.48
especially the more the greener regions

3121.59 --> 3125.58
where there's much more green and trees

3123.48 --> 3131.22
around and all that and even forest

3125.58 --> 3133.68
situations well they usually just from

3131.22 --> 3135.7799999999997
maintenance situation have to yeah

3133.68 --> 3138.5699999999997
ground up a lot of branches or remove

3135.78 --> 3140.67
trees and [ __ ] and there's often places

3138.57 --> 3143.25
where there's a huge amount of surplus

3140.67 --> 3147.81
woodchips that they normally would have

3143.25 --> 3150.78
to pay for it to get rid of it that yeah

3147.81 --> 3152.64
if you know who these people are you

3150.78 --> 3156.8300000000004
could potentially just go there with the

3152.64 --> 3159.96
truck the car and the back scoop

3156.83 --> 3162.33
whatever and just say let me take some

3159.96 --> 3164.4
of this off your hands for free and I'll

3162.33 --> 3167.5499999999997
be glad to give it to you you won't have

3164.4 --> 3174.84
to really buy it no if you know where to

3167.55 --> 3177.1800000000003
where to find it and if you have a yeah

3174.84 --> 3179.1600000000003
kind of a farm like situation homestead

3177.18 --> 3182.2799999999997
with the decent farm doesn't have to be

3179.16 --> 3183.7799999999997
huge you'll probably have a car you'll

3182.28 --> 3189.65
be able to get it that way you won't

3183.78 --> 3189.65
have to buy it for money in some store

3191.66 --> 3197.69
just the tip that I picked up from that

3195.42 --> 3197.69
video

3201.28 --> 3205.6600000000003
see if I can find that video back

3211.9 --> 3214.86
where is it

3219.109 --> 3229.66
this is so long ago wait I'm right I

3224.359 --> 3229.66
posted it with my dad

3234.72 --> 3249.8089999999997
I think this is it hold on yeah I think

3247.529 --> 3256.47
it's the one yeah cool

3249.809 --> 3258.15
I found the link so I'll put that in

3256.47 --> 3263.3289999999997
check for those that haven't seen it

3258.15 --> 3263.329
video yet it's a pretty long video

3268.31 --> 3273.86
at one hour 43 minutes but this is

3271.94 --> 3275.51
basically the what I'm using as a source

3273.86 --> 3281.9900000000002
for everything I've been talking about

3275.51 --> 3284.2400000000002
in the last 15 minutes I talked about it

3281.99 --> 3286.6299999999997
like a few weeks ago if I remember

3284.24 --> 3286.6299999999997
correctly

3294.8 --> 3299.78
yeah James Mason time does fly when

3297.32 --> 3303.04
you're having fun doesn't it so I'm

3299.78 --> 3303.0400000000004
almost gonna round out the show

3330.12 --> 3336.63
all right well it seems likely for ya

3333.24 --> 3340.83
and 101 rockhound says that he or what

3336.63 --> 3343.02
he used to operate right so he knows a

3340.83 --> 3346.86
place where there's lots of wood

3343.02 --> 3348.54
chippers doing that work so you think

3346.86 --> 3349.9500000000003
that that place might be a place where

3348.54 --> 3351.33
you could just go with the truck and say

3349.95 --> 3354.33
hey I'll take some of those wood chips

3351.33 --> 3364.14
off your hands or what they asked

3354.33 --> 3366.63
payment for that because yeah that's

3364.14 --> 3367.8599999999997
interesting to know somebody or a place

3366.63 --> 3370.07
where you could go for that kind of

3367.86 --> 3370.07
thing

3376.14 --> 3380.73
ah seeking star water gardening is

3378.87 --> 3382.1
back-breaking work don't fool yourself

3380.73 --> 3386.52
hold on

3382.1 --> 3389.25
it could be but you can also be very

3386.52 --> 3393.54
smart about it very informed and then it

3389.25 --> 3395.7
may be somewhat of a hard work but if

3393.54 --> 3397.62
you do it right then you're not gonna

3395.7 --> 3407.04
have to break your back every single

3397.62 --> 3409.92
time oh my back is broken well that I

3407.04 --> 3412.14
didn't mean literally it's just you know

3409.92 --> 3413.79
it's like old-fashioned farming and then

3412.14 --> 3417.69
you have to do a yuge amount of work

3413.79 --> 3420.66
with no super guarantee of success or if

3417.69 --> 3421.23
you do it all smart and if you learn

3420.66 --> 3423.48
from nature

3421.23 --> 3426.66
look the video I linked up is exactly

3423.48 --> 3428.4
about that it tells you tells you know

3426.66 --> 3431.5699999999997
if you do things right you don't have to

3428.4 --> 3434.94
constantly work your ass off to get huge

3431.57 --> 3441.3
rewards you just have to be very smart

3434.94 --> 3443.34
and careful about it right turning the

3441.3 --> 3446.9300000000003
soil well that's something you if you do

3443.34 --> 3446.9300000000003
it and right you don't have to do that

3447.86 --> 3453.48
because turning the soil is it's like an

3451.17 --> 3458.07
effect that happens when you farm on

3453.48 --> 3461.28
exposed earth then it clings in then you

3458.07 --> 3463.5
have to turn it but if you use a mulch

3461.28 --> 3467.55
system and all that if you properly

3463.5 --> 3469.5
prepare the ground then you don't have

3467.55 --> 3471.2400000000002
to keep on doing that you don't have to

3469.5 --> 3473.67
keep turning the soil every time like

3471.24 --> 3475.56
that it's one of the things that this

3473.67 --> 3482.2200000000003
video that I linked to I'll post it

3475.56 --> 3484.5
again that's what it revealed yeah so

3482.22 --> 3488.22
I'm gonna run out the show now this

3484.5 --> 3490.56
farming show is it's good to talk about

3488.22 --> 3493.1099999999997
these things especially if you guys are

3490.56 --> 3495.84
into it you know and I want to learn

3493.11 --> 3497.9100000000003
more because I I want to do that I want

3495.84 --> 3499.98
to really do that but it has to be my

3497.91 --> 3501.48
garden I'm not just gonna be some public

3499.98 --> 3502.92
place where I don't have oversight or

3501.48 --> 3507.12
have to travel [ __ ]
