[Music]

36.739 --> 43.89
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.44 --> 45.57
early-bird number 226 I'm your host

43.89 --> 47.43
Arwen and before we start the show

45.57 --> 49.62
please don't forget to share it on any

47.43 --> 51.42
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

49.62 --> 53.07
already subscribed to my channel and hit

51.42 --> 55.379000000000005
the bell notifications so you know when

53.07 --> 58.32
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

55.379 --> 60.239
p.m. Amsterdam time every day

58.32 --> 65.19
please also support me through the Super

60.239 --> 70.17
chats paypal patreon and my GoFundMe if

65.19 --> 74.03
you can to support the show so today the

70.17 --> 77.63
weather is quite different it's like

74.03 --> 81.44
totally totally different it's cloudy

77.63 --> 86.88
it's not really moist it's a lot fresher

81.44 --> 90.81
swindie and it's not cold but it's

86.88 --> 95.61
nothing like it was yesterday but quite

90.81 --> 99.799
a relief to be fair I slept a lot better

95.61 --> 106.11
this morning as well because of it so

99.799 --> 108.72
yeah my eye is still screwing around it

106.11 --> 112.259
appears like it's gotten worse but it

108.72 --> 115.22
hasn't actually yesterday it was like

112.259 --> 118.229
really agitated today it seems to be

115.22 --> 120.29899999999999
like the inflammation itself seems to be

118.229 --> 123.119
gone and now it's just like the cleaning

120.299 --> 125.52000000000001
up face and that's it is kind of

123.119 --> 127.799
annoying but I think it probably it'll

125.52 --> 131.13
probably be gone in like 2 days or

127.799 --> 135.48000000000002
something that extreme heat didn't

131.13 --> 140.91
really help either so I got with me to

135.48 --> 146.08999999999997
my coffee tea and a banana I don't know

140.91 --> 146.09
I thought I wanted one today

150.49 --> 161.78
so let's see who's in chat okay we got

156.62 --> 165.28
Oh Braco there what sir Alice mist good

161.78 --> 170.63
to see you too hmm that's it for now

165.28 --> 176.03
15 watching I don't know maybe everyone

170.63 --> 178.51999999999998
else is like also taking the time to

176.03 --> 180.17
sleep extra because finally it's not

178.52 --> 184.34
that hot so everybody's just still

180.17 --> 186.55999999999997
sleeping I wouldn't be surprised I would

184.34 --> 189.86
probably do the same thing if I didn't

186.56 --> 199.63
have a show myself mmm

189.86 --> 203.35000000000002
hello IRA Kilda hope hmm so yeah a very

199.63 --> 203.35
interesting morning today

206.45 --> 212.67999999999998
no Randy no nobody's seen him though I

210.97 --> 219.77
don't care

212.68 --> 223.66
hey mark colored so yeah there's a lot

219.77 --> 228.20000000000002
of stuff concerning Flat Earth but first

223.66 --> 231.68
wanted to resonate some interesting

228.2 --> 233.89
personal experience just for a personal

231.68 --> 233.89000000000001
note

241.97 --> 245.31
delete delete if you want to know you're

244.68 --> 247.35
banned

245.31 --> 249.33
then say hello if you have three dots

247.35 --> 256.56
next to it you're not banned

249.33 --> 258.33000000000004
don't be annoying alright so I went to

256.56 --> 262.56
the coffee shop this morning because my

258.33 --> 264.51
stash had run out it's normal and I was

262.56 --> 267.57
sitting there just thinking like yeah

264.51 --> 271.62
well that's gonna be killed a happy it's

267.57 --> 273.81
not that I'll heat hot anymore and I'm

271.62 --> 280.08
just sitting there smoking a joint like

273.81 --> 286.08
one of my first and then this this girl

280.08 --> 290.07
comes walking in right so she just sits

286.08 --> 291.81
down on the other side and like she's

290.07 --> 295.14
pretty attractive now of course there's

291.81 --> 296.84
more attractive woman or that have

295.14 --> 299.19
attractive elements that I take note of

296.84 --> 301.22999999999996
often it's like oh yeah you're kind of

299.19 --> 303.11
beautiful but I don't know there's

301.23 --> 306.18
something about you that seems like it's

303.11 --> 308.31
poised polluted or corrupted or

306.18 --> 312.72
something so I don't really really like

308.31 --> 313.95
it it's more like as skin deep thing but

312.72 --> 316.97
with this girl there was something

313.95 --> 321.65999999999997
interesting I liked her energy it's and

316.97 --> 323.46000000000004
she actually came walking over to me and

321.66 --> 325.53000000000003
sat down next to me and we had like an

323.46 --> 331.85999999999996
hour conversation about all kinds of

325.53 --> 336.08
things and now I'm yeah not used to that

331.86 --> 338.49
kind of stuff she was really cute and

336.08 --> 341.25
she knew that and I think she probably

338.49 --> 342.84000000000003
thought the same but she did apparently

341.25 --> 345.78
say that she had a boyfriend and

342.84 --> 350.34
everything so I don't know what that was

345.78 --> 354.0
but I'm I'm gonna I'm expecting an email

350.34 --> 357.73999999999995
from her for something else related like

354.0 --> 360.48
more business-related she was into

357.74 --> 363.17
bookkeeping which is surprisingly

360.48 --> 367.41
interesting for somebody that attractive

363.17 --> 371.63
or yeah it's I don't know I I was pretty

367.41 --> 371.63000000000005
astounded by that by her as a person

371.72 --> 381.48
so I don't know maybe it's just a summer

376.43 --> 383.40000000000003
but I'm secretly hoping maybe sometime

381.48 --> 385.20000000000005
not in the not-too near future we might

383.4 --> 390.63
get together and the interesting things

385.2 --> 392.90999999999997
may happen and I don't know my

390.63 --> 399.71
subconscious definitely tells me she's a

392.91 --> 404.16
suitable she's suitable for logos and

399.71 --> 406.56
yeah it wasn't the type of person

404.16 --> 408.96000000000004
constantly staring in their mobile you

406.56 --> 412.5
know good sign was actually staring into

408.96 --> 414.81
an agenda and drawing things on it it's

412.5 --> 418.53
a good sign okay all good signs except

414.81 --> 426.63
for the boyfriend anyway the wrestling

418.53 --> 429.78
with her in a coffee what the oh god you

426.63 --> 433.04
guys are weirdos or rather much Sara

429.78 --> 433.03999999999996
Alice mist is a weirdo

445.57 --> 451.61
crazy polish man yes I think it is

448.85 --> 457.94
beneficial but it all depends on the

451.61 --> 460.13
perspective you know because the ballers

457.94 --> 462.5
are not gonna make any progress they

460.13 --> 464.99
only make more regress the only hardened

462.5 --> 470.06
their psychological defenses and then

464.99 --> 474.28000000000003
their neurotic dedication but people in

470.06 --> 477.83
general oh yes it is good to behold that

474.28 --> 480.77
to see what the behaviors are what the

477.83 --> 482.69
patterns are a study material so people

480.77 --> 485.39
can figure out what's going on with this

482.69 --> 490.07
crazy ball belief whether they believe

485.39 --> 493.96999999999997
in it or not that's almost a sight

490.07 --> 495.59
question now at this point because yeah

493.97 --> 499.40000000000003
there's still so much missing knowledge

495.59 --> 504.83
so it's still an if if situation in many

499.4 --> 508.01
ways but seeing that the ballers get

504.83 --> 510.4
this crazy and yeah Flat Earth as many

508.01 --> 512.15
of them also get a little crazy but

510.4 --> 518.84
nothing like this

512.15 --> 520.79
not that devious you know not that red

518.84 --> 523.3100000000001
herring related yeah

520.79 --> 525.68
except for a couple of quite devious

523.31 --> 527.2399999999999
individuals and we put it most of you

525.68 --> 535.2099999999999
probably know who I'm talking about

527.24 --> 538.07
but yeah to just see that going on is

535.21 --> 543.35
helpful for people to make up their mind

538.07 --> 545.9300000000001
as to what is going on so yes those

543.35 --> 547.85
people debating the ballers themselves

545.93 --> 552.7399999999999
they'll never get it because they don't

547.85 --> 555.41
want to get it they may like bluff and

552.74 --> 557.9300000000001
say yeah I really want to get it but

555.41 --> 560.06
that's all Bluff they don't want to get

557.93 --> 564.01
it because they're not actually putting

560.06 --> 568.0899999999999
their psyche behind trying to get it no

564.01 --> 570.49
they're deflecting everything

568.09 --> 573.46
as soon as something doesn't stick to

570.49 --> 574.86
their framework they drop it it just

573.46 --> 579.22
happens

574.86 --> 582.28
they can't even really consciously

579.22 --> 583.8100000000001
experience it even I presume with some

582.28 --> 587.67
individuals especially when they're

583.81 --> 587.67
tense they just don't hear it anymore

595.199 --> 604.3589999999999
right crazy Polish man well at that we

599.739 --> 606.879
know Flat Earth side debaters are not

604.359 --> 611.3190000000001
gonna make too much progress regarding

606.879 --> 614.8190000000001
the ballers either except that we figure

611.319 --> 617.439
out more and more how their tactics work

614.819 --> 619.7489999999999
what is really going on as well and

617.439 --> 622.2389999999999
improving our approach and at the same

619.749 --> 624.9390000000001
time finding good cornerstone arguments

622.239 --> 635.229
and refining them and we have and we

624.939 --> 641.2289999999999
continue doing this okay this poem this

635.229 --> 643.389
is a English hangout so he's asking in

641.229 --> 648.279
Dutch if I can explain gravity to him

643.389 --> 653.619
oof well that's not that's not a short

648.279 --> 657.869
explanation but to sum it all up grab

653.619 --> 662.739
gravity is an aberration it's a

657.869 --> 667.2090000000001
conceptual framework that happens to fit

662.739 --> 670.869
perfectly smoothly in and can be found

667.209 --> 673.2689999999999
in within several phenomena but all of

670.869 --> 675.299
them share a common element to them and

673.269 --> 679.419
that is that you have to presuppose it

675.299 --> 679.689
because there's no physical evidence for

679.419 --> 682.049
it

679.689 --> 685.929
there's only deduction based evidence

682.049 --> 689.499
and it's really you can't point at it so

685.929 --> 691.2389999999999
what we did as flat earthers or not me

689.499 --> 692.9490000000001
even at first because I was defending

691.239 --> 695.979
gravity for a long time because I

692.949 --> 699.789
believed in in the aberration and other

695.979 --> 701.409
people still do like Bob for example but

699.789 --> 703.72
yeah as soon as we figured out wait

701.409 --> 705.429
scientific method independent variable

703.72 --> 706.9590000000001
you can't actually vary it you always

705.429 --> 710.169
have to vary something else that doesn't

706.959 --> 713.559
technically make any sense and it's

710.169 --> 717.489
inconsistent really like the buoyancy

713.559 --> 720.669
effect and the gravity that there are

717.489 --> 723.35
inconsistency in the setup but if you

720.669 --> 726.37
then basically

723.35 --> 728.96
[ __ ] from a relative density angle

726.37 --> 732.53
which is definitely scientifically

728.96 --> 734.51
provable as we have and cannot be refute

732.53 --> 737.72
it because yeah try it out

734.51 --> 741.38
you can't it'll always do that physical

737.72 --> 744.98
setup and if I take that as a

741.38 --> 747.02
cornerstone and I have and refined what

744.98 --> 749.69
is really going on with this relative

747.02 --> 752.96
density effect what it really is because

749.69 --> 755.69
there's a direct correlation based or

752.96 --> 758.12
while causation in this case look the

755.69 --> 760.6400000000001
proof is causation there's a causation

758.12 --> 763.13
based effect going on but what is the

760.64 --> 765.02
the wider of refined structure of this

763.13 --> 768.56
so I started working on that over time

765.02 --> 771.43
basically improvised at first and then

768.56 --> 773.9899999999999
it seemed to work out and that is that

771.43 --> 776.93
relative density what is really going on

773.99 --> 780.5
what the real independent variable is is

776.93 --> 783.79
the density of the object in relation to

780.5 --> 787.61
the medium that surrounds it entirely

783.79 --> 790.88
that if that is not the same the same

787.61 --> 792.95
density then there is a relative density

790.88 --> 796.99
disequilibrium between the object and

792.95 --> 800.0600000000001
the medium so the object will then start

796.99 --> 804.8
displace if it has maneuverability will

800.06 --> 809.7199999999999
fall or float up depending on the

804.8 --> 812.7199999999999
circumstances and as soon as it becomes

809.72 --> 815.15
stuck because of lack of maneuverability

812.72 --> 817.13
so something solid may be keeping it in

815.15 --> 822.28
place somehow that is stuck to the

817.13 --> 824.84
ground or whatever then that motion that

822.28 --> 828.53
force that is causing it to at first

824.84 --> 831.4300000000001
accelerate and then displace or move at

828.53 --> 835.52
a stable velocity depending on the

831.43 --> 836.93
medium friction because that does still

835.52 --> 839.3
happen that does create the maximum

836.93 --> 841.91
velocity the relative densities of the

839.3 --> 844.49
object even in the face of the medium

841.91 --> 847.2199999999999
and then the friction that that medium

844.49 --> 849.44
poses as it is displacing there's also a

847.22 --> 851.9300000000001
part that causes the maximum velocity of

849.44 --> 853.12
whatever's displacing but once it gets

851.93 --> 858.519
stuck

853.12 --> 862.3
then that motion will instead translate

858.519 --> 864.55
into localized pressure because the

862.3 --> 866.62
object in relation to its medium though

864.55 --> 869.199
it's stuck is still in this equilibrium

866.62 --> 871.499
with the entire medium but it can no

869.199 --> 875.4699999999999
longer displace because it's stuck and

871.499 --> 877.47
then it will instead start to translate

875.47 --> 880.12
that relative density disequilibrium

877.47 --> 882.2090000000001
into pressure because it's still trying

880.12 --> 885.37
to get to its relative density

882.209 --> 889.569
equilibrium points in the entire medium

885.37 --> 892.42
and that explains well pretty much

889.569 --> 895.439
everything concerning gravity except

892.42 --> 899.829
it's all based on an physically

895.439 --> 902.23
scientifically provable concept instead

899.829 --> 908.05
of a presupposition or concept like

902.23 --> 910.5690000000001
gravity so I basically replaced the

908.05 --> 912.7589999999999
entire framework for gravity and it can

910.569 --> 915.819
work it with all the aberration none

912.759 --> 918.4590000000001
there's no exception for it it's kind of

915.819 --> 920.2299999999999
weird doing that because hey when you

918.459 --> 922.8699999999999
conceptualize and interact with all

920.23 --> 925.4490000000001
their forces like a car or whatever

922.87 --> 930.16
however you're going to do that then

925.449 --> 932.92
just presupposing a standard force this

930.16 --> 935.92
equilibrium downward presupposing that

932.92 --> 938.529
is much easier for the set up to make it

935.92 --> 941.3789999999999
an element within in the entire thing so

938.529 --> 945.429
yeah for constructive purposes I'm not

941.379 --> 949.389
saying never use gravity but because it

945.429 --> 950.679
is still based on things that are real

949.389 --> 953.05
effects as it were

950.679 --> 955.42
it's just presuppose that it's caused by

953.05 --> 957.2199999999999
gravity that's the only difference

955.42 --> 960.61
but it's actually caused by relative

957.22 --> 964.1700000000001
density this equilibrium so that's my

960.61 --> 964.17
full explanation on gravity

969.82 --> 975.46
right well GFB 45

975.52 --> 981.35
how do dense objects get their direction

978.26 --> 983.9
well the direction is because the

981.35 --> 988.6
relative density spectrum is in a very

983.9 --> 992.6899999999999
specific division there is an alignment

988.6 --> 995.5400000000001
within the relative density spectrum of

992.69 --> 999.83
all things and that is that the lesser

995.54 --> 1002.26
dense in our known orientation seem to

999.83 --> 1007.0600000000001
be going that way and the answer seems

1002.26 --> 1013.6
to be going that way but only depending

1007.06 --> 1018.31
on the medium and relative density does

1013.6 --> 1023.44
not actually explain the cause of the

1018.31 --> 1026.05
alignment it just describes it it's

1023.44 --> 1027.94
basically a description of the actual

1026.05 --> 1031.6
local effects and how they come into

1027.94 --> 1039.3700000000001
being as is it doesn't explain the

1031.6 --> 1043.06
alignment and that remains and who knows

1039.37 --> 1046.87
if we're ever gonna find a reason a an

1043.06 --> 1051.52
actual emulate able reason physically

1046.87 --> 1054.76
micro emulate able reason as to why that

1051.52 --> 1056.92
alignment who knows because if you're

1054.76 --> 1059.76
gonna simulate it in a computer ya lose

1056.92 --> 1063.97
just very easy to put ug in there

1059.76 --> 1068.56
instead programa didn't artificially

1063.97 --> 1071.98
emulate that it's much easier but yeah

1068.56 --> 1074.44
it doesn't make it real life just very

1071.98 --> 1076.92
easy to presuppose and to use the

1074.44 --> 1076.92
structure

1079.3 --> 1082.3999999999999
[Music]

1087.02 --> 1093.35
okay I'll kill the hope can you please

1089.87 --> 1095.11
explain clouds with relative density

1093.35 --> 1101.24
[Music]

1095.11 --> 1107.8999999999999
well have to say that the clouds are

1101.24 --> 1110.54
likely to be of a lower density then the

1107.9 --> 1112.3600000000001
air below it otherwise they wouldn't be

1110.54 --> 1116.12
floating up there they'd all be sinking

1112.36 --> 1118.76
and this might have something to do with

1116.12 --> 1122.6
the temperature up there and that makes

1118.76 --> 1129.16
sense because moisture typically starts

1122.6 --> 1129.1599999999999
the condensate in cold and cold air also

1129.82 --> 1140.06
decreases the pressure I think so yeah

1137.72 --> 1143.69
there's a mix working with the heat and

1140.06 --> 1146.6
the pressure and the density all of it

1143.69 --> 1148.64
but yeah the floods obviously would be

1146.6 --> 1152.1999999999998
having a lower density in relation to

1148.64 --> 1156.5200000000002
the atmosphere near to the ground and

1152.2 --> 1162.44
sometimes they don't sometimes it's

1156.52 --> 1165.41
sometimes clouds yeah it can be misty so

1162.44 --> 1168.17
it all depends on the relation between

1165.41 --> 1172.88
the relative density of the air layer

1168.17 --> 1176.18
and of the cloud layer and the clouds

1172.88 --> 1178.6000000000001
it's still explainable through relative

1176.18 --> 1178.6000000000001
density

1186.72 --> 1193.68
yeah who knows if there's like magnetic

1190.02 --> 1195.78
influencers potentially make keeping the

1193.68 --> 1197.13
clouds up there as I don't know I don't

1195.78 --> 1201.3
thinks I don't think that's even

1197.13 --> 1207.2700000000002
necessary like yeah it's just a weird

1201.3 --> 1210.87
nature of of mist of of condensating

1207.27 --> 1212.73
water it it doesn't necessarily it's not

1210.87 --> 1217.32
like a water droplet that just

1212.73 --> 1219.74
immediately starts to fall down it's

1217.32 --> 1219.74
different

1221.12 --> 1229.8
right a water vapor less dense than the

1226.53 --> 1231.87
air layer below it because the air

1229.8 --> 1236.6699999999998
layers up there are bound to be less

1231.87 --> 1239.1599999999999
dense maybe even the same mixture of air

1236.67 --> 1241.5
but just because of the temperature

1239.16 --> 1243.77
differential the pressure is going to be

1241.5 --> 1243.77
less

1247.29 --> 1251.55
or the yeah the relative density the

1249.57 --> 1253.62
pressure how much it is compacted like

1251.55 --> 1255.54
if it is more compacted if air is more

1253.62 --> 1258.54
compacted there's more pressure there's

1255.54 --> 1260.49
more density if it's less compacted then

1258.54 --> 1266.0
there is less pressure and less density

1260.49 --> 1266.0
so in that sense it relates linearly

1279.14 --> 1285.49
I'm getting a couple of good questions

1281.69 --> 1285.49
today thank you for that all everyone

1290.33 --> 1301.05
Daniel I already explained that right

1293.88 --> 1304.89
you know that the acceleration rate is

1301.05 --> 1308.96
simply a natural side effect of oh yeah

1304.89 --> 1312.21
of a force but that force is not

1308.96 --> 1315.57
perpetually present you that there is no

1312.21 --> 1318.0
proof of that it's only there's only

1315.57 --> 1320.52
proof when a force actually comes into

1318.0 --> 1325.22
play and there comes the relative

1320.52 --> 1328.05
density Theory Souness so an object is

1325.22 --> 1331.56
brought out of its relative density

1328.05 --> 1333.57
equilibrium or taken away from its yeah

1331.56 --> 1339.36
immobile position where it will exert

1333.57 --> 1342.45
some pressure then it may be able to

1339.36 --> 1346.26
start displacing and accelerate in the

1342.45 --> 1347.7
medium and all that that's where the

1346.26 --> 1350.04
force comes into play is a relative

1347.7 --> 1354.05
density disequilibrium it's directly

1350.04 --> 1354.05
related directly provable

1362.46 --> 1369.21
and the falling rate look the

1366.059 --> 1371.549
acceleration rate is the same the only

1369.21 --> 1375.23
difference between objects falling

1371.549 --> 1377.94
through a medium that may be thick or

1375.23 --> 1380.129
extremely thin or a vacuum is that

1377.94 --> 1383.159
there's less friction from the medium to

1380.129 --> 1386.07
slow it down and if there's as good as

1383.159 --> 1388.8500000000001
no friction then there is no maximum

1386.07 --> 1392.249
velocity because the maximum velocity of

1388.85 --> 1398.58
a displacing object is directly related

1392.249 --> 1400.74
to the ya the the thickness of the

1398.58 --> 1403.799
medium its travel traveling through and

1400.74 --> 1406.98
how much air friction or water friction

1403.799 --> 1409.289
or whatever it's gonna cause on the

1406.98 --> 1412.34
object during it's relative density

1409.289 --> 1412.34
cause displacement

1424.11 --> 1431.1299999999999
right well white bear you get the point

1427.89 --> 1433.64
it is that is technically what it is

1431.13 --> 1436.95
relative density is literally a

1433.64 --> 1440.179
scientifically viable replacement for

1436.95 --> 1444.299
gravity which is a unprovable

1440.179 --> 1446.88
presuppositional theory it's literally

1444.299 --> 1448.83
unprovable and every test trying to

1446.88 --> 1452.279
prove it always fail because always

1448.83 --> 1459.11
about trying something else doesn't make

1452.279 --> 1461.46
any sense it's just a framework

1459.11 --> 1465.6899999999998
presupposition but relative density is

1461.46 --> 1468.3890000000001
much more solid in explaining it and you

1465.69 --> 1473.8500000000001
can test every part of it for yourself

1468.389 --> 1475.9499999999998
and the other ratios of the falling or

1473.85 --> 1479.549
the displacement ratio is the pressure

1475.95 --> 1483.179
ratios within the medium versus the

1479.549 --> 1487.559
object could all be very well documented

1483.179 --> 1492.3300000000002
and as to the D falling rates maximum

1487.559 --> 1493.86
velocities pressure relations all these

1492.33 --> 1497.51
things could be extremely well

1493.86 --> 1497.51
documented and tested

1502.99 --> 1507.159
yeah they've pulled there is a force

1505.14 --> 1509.679
absolutely there is a force because

1507.159 --> 1512.5900000000001
there is an object whatever that is

1509.679 --> 1516.3700000000001
accelerating and then gaining a maximum

1512.59 --> 1520.059
velocity and that force is caused by

1516.37 --> 1522.8799999999999
relative density disequilibrium in other

1520.059 --> 1527.399
words the object's density in relation

1522.88 --> 1531.029
to the medium it is in is not the same

1527.399 --> 1534.75
so the object will then start to travel

1531.029 --> 1538.39
start to displace accelerate and move

1534.75 --> 1543.309
towards their equilibrium point in

1538.39 --> 1545.44
relation to the medium that's just what

1543.309 --> 1547.799
happens until it can no longer move and

1545.44 --> 1555.64
then it's get stuck or whatever and

1547.799 --> 1558.1299999999999
starts to exert pressure there so

1555.64 --> 1559.8990000000001
definitely a force the force that causes

1558.13 --> 1562.2700000000002
displacement when it's in this

1559.899 --> 1564.399
equilibrium and then the force that when

1562.27 --> 1567.6399999999999
it's no lock and no longer maneuver will

1564.399 --> 1573.6399999999999
cause pressure in the direction of where

1567.64 --> 1576.24
it's equilibrium point will be this is

1573.64 --> 1576.24
what happens

1582.04 --> 1586.81
[Music]

1583.81 --> 1586.81
whatever

1591.68 --> 1596.45
yeah I'm gonna try this banana man it's

1593.84 --> 1598.9299999999998
been like half a year since I last ate a

1596.45 --> 1598.93
banana

1612.58 --> 1618.4399999999998
[Music]

1615.44 --> 1618.44
Cheers

1624.26 --> 1630.96
yeah the boat i yet took it down for a

1626.97 --> 1633.03
moment like with the heat yesterday I

1630.96 --> 1634.68
thought like okay I'm gonna take it down

1633.03 --> 1638.24
and I'm gonna give it a break for a

1634.68 --> 1641.8200000000002
while and I kind of forgot about it I

1638.24 --> 1643.65
got here in a hurry I barely was able to

1641.82 --> 1645.48
start the show in time and I've

1643.65 --> 1647.8400000000001
forgotten I didn't have my bow up

1645.48 --> 1647.84
anymore

1663.1 --> 1665.76
yeah

1672.65 --> 1683.7900000000002
hunting girls that's very nice well that

1680.91 --> 1692.309
starts show I shared that I may have

1683.79 --> 1697.25
caught one but if I am if I did it's

1692.309 --> 1697.25
gonna be a long and more long run thing

1699.02 --> 1703.92
but now generally I don't go out hunting

1701.79 --> 1707.1399999999999
for girls now

1703.92 --> 1707.14
[Music]

1714.8 --> 1721.27
yeah mark colored that is just

1717.02 --> 1724.6399999999999
completely irrelevant doesn't matter

1721.27 --> 1728.6
what caused anything to be anywhere it

1724.64 --> 1733.1000000000001
simply is if you take it for where it is

1728.6 --> 1735.9199999999998
and then what it does my description of

1733.1 --> 1738.4399999999998
relative density disequilibrium causing

1735.92 --> 1742.3000000000002
displacement and pressure simply is

1738.44 --> 1745.3600000000001
correct and I'd like to see you try

1742.3 --> 1745.36
falsify it

1751.15 --> 1754.45
potential with your food no it's just

1753.86 --> 1757.76
there

1754.45 --> 1760.16
the disequilibrium causes the force if

1757.76 --> 1763.84
something goes out of this equilibrium

1760.16 --> 1766.91
they for sets in and it will cause that

1763.84 --> 1772.82
it's it that would be similar to saying

1766.91 --> 1775.0400000000002
what caused a surface tension well what

1772.82 --> 1777.309
does cause surface tension you know we

1775.04 --> 1781.73
know it's there we know it works

1777.309 --> 1783.6789999999999
so do we then discard it because it's

1781.73 --> 1786.5
very difficult to actually figure out

1783.679 --> 1789.38
what is causing that force what is

1786.5 --> 1792.58
causing that effect no because it's

1789.38 --> 1798.919
there okay

1792.58 --> 1801.5
and yeah I can simply conclude that

1798.919 --> 1804.46
relative density disequilibrium of an

1801.5 --> 1808.15
object with its medium causes it to

1804.46 --> 1813.26
displace towards its relative density

1808.15 --> 1819.26
equilibrium point or until it can no

1813.26 --> 1823.07
longer maneuver and that's just it no it

1819.26 --> 1827.39
is a force but the force is not actually

1823.07 --> 1830.21
a factor in the scientific proof or

1827.39 --> 1836.0800000000002
relative density but there is definitely

1830.21 --> 1839.929
a force that arrives and yeah it's there

1836.08 --> 1842.6299999999999
it's just not really required in order

1839.929 --> 1844.549
to approve relative density that's the

1842.63 --> 1846.95
issue does it mean that you can

1844.549 --> 1849.049
definitely point at it in like yeah

1846.95 --> 1851.39
alright force force right there it is

1849.049 --> 1853.46
there it is you can stop wondering about

1851.39 --> 1855.74
where's the forthcoming for which the

1853.46 --> 1857.96
force there it's right there it

1855.74 --> 1860.29
manifests as soon as something comes in

1857.96 --> 1864.3500000000001
this equilibrium there it is very

1860.29 --> 1870.799
provable all based on relative density

1864.35 --> 1874.04
theory so yeah it that's it now the

1870.799 --> 1878.24
direction is not magic it's just we

1874.04 --> 1880.79
don't know why it is that direction that

1878.24 --> 1884.21
is just it the relative density spectrum

1880.79 --> 1888.71
is simply divided as is and we

1884.21 --> 1891.28
don't know why and I don't care really

1888.71 --> 1893.78
at this point doesn't really matter

1891.28 --> 1896.6
there are more concerning things to

1893.78 --> 1898.58
start out proving before we get to that

1896.6 --> 1904.25
point like hey what are the freaking

1898.58 --> 1906.1
confines you know might be good point to

1904.25 --> 1910.04
figure that one out before we start to

1906.1 --> 1912.98
ponder upon what causes the relative

1910.04 --> 1915.4099999999999
density division why is that less dense

1912.98 --> 1920.9
up there and the denser down there we

1915.41 --> 1924.1000000000001
don't know yeah everything that will try

1920.9 --> 1926.48
to explain that is gonna be pure

1924.1 --> 1930.05
presuppositional theory because there is

1926.48 --> 1933.74
no way at this point to figure it out

1930.05 --> 1938.84
and I don't see any point to it it just

1933.74 --> 1944.09
is I'm much more concerned with data of

1938.84 --> 1948.32
what is just like the globe of the

1944.09 --> 1952.27
heavens the star rotations the visuals

1948.32 --> 1955.46
the recorded facial persistent data of

1952.27 --> 1957.1399999999999
the angle the angular data of all the

1955.46 --> 1959.75
heavenly bodies in relation to the

1957.14 --> 1961.2800000000002
position of the earth that is data it's

1959.75 --> 1963.56
there it's always there it's always the

1961.28 --> 1967.37
same it follows a very distinct specific

1963.56 --> 1970.1
pattern that is unchanged and that is

1967.37 --> 1974.5
solid data now whatever you're gonna

1970.1 --> 1979.55
presuppose that all means that is up to

1974.5 --> 1982.79
whatever up to yeah people that have a

1979.55 --> 1985.94
set mind in how it's supposed to be or

1982.79 --> 1986.42
how it's supposed to turn out I try not

1985.94 --> 1990.88
to do that

1986.42 --> 1994.46
although I do speculate in in somewhat

1990.88 --> 1998.3600000000001
strange directions for most people like

1994.46 --> 2001.06
I entertain the concept of a looping

1998.36 --> 2005.6799999999998
special cone find where the realm is

2001.06 --> 2008.1699999999998
looping in on itself but that's yeah

2005.68 --> 2012.4
that's also conceptual but it could be

2008.17 --> 2015.01
and it could even be provable so yeah

2012.4 --> 2018.42
it's just a curiosity that I do and it

2015.01 --> 2018.42
would solve several issues

2019.0 --> 2025.4
but yeah that's just my thing it's not

2023.06 --> 2027.62
like I'm saying oh this has to be it now

2025.4 --> 2029.69
it can never be that pizza thing or

2027.62 --> 2031.9699999999998
whatever now it could be it could it

2029.69 --> 2036.16
might turn out to be that and if it what

2031.97 --> 2043.94
I would frankly be disappointed because

2036.16 --> 2045.92
yeah but who knows maybe it is that the

2043.94 --> 2048.05
pancake and maybe there's a little bit

2045.92 --> 2050.27
more on the edge of that pancake I don't

2048.05 --> 2053.51
know what that would be it might be that

2050.27 --> 2056.72
but I don't know I I still can't put it

2053.51 --> 2060.0200000000004
to rest that it might just turn out to

2056.72 --> 2062.39
be a little bit more surreal my life

2060.02 --> 2065.29
experiences especially with the spirit

2062.39 --> 2068.62
realm and everything it was so surreal

2065.29 --> 2076.2799999999997
it wouldn't make sense to me that

2068.62 --> 2078.38
reality would be that basic I think the

2076.28 --> 2081.0800000000004
creators too smart to make it that basic

2078.38 --> 2085.69
and besides things like the globe of the

2081.08 --> 2085.69
heavens are by default surreal

2090.23 --> 2094.86
so why would we expect the actual

2093.18 --> 2098.37
physical come find to be very

2094.86 --> 2102.29
straightforward especially linear basic

2098.37 --> 2104.73
I don't know I don't see that as a

2102.29 --> 2110.24
consistency with all the other elements

2104.73 --> 2110.2400000000002
of this realm to be fair

2113.51 --> 2116.0800000000004
it

2116.21 --> 2121.91
species is this list you sphere no

2119.359 --> 2124.609
that's not the celestial sphere that I'm

2121.91 --> 2128.2999999999997
talking about the celestial sphere is

2124.609 --> 2131.98
the perception of the the angular

2128.3 --> 2135.1090000000004
perception of the lights in the heavens

2131.98 --> 2137.75
there are angular perceptions there is

2135.109 --> 2141.95
no proof that they are actually coming

2137.75 --> 2147.2
from any specific location nor that they

2141.95 --> 2149.089
emanate yet they there's no proof that

2147.2 --> 2151.79
they're emanating from a specific point

2149.089 --> 2154.94
the only thing that we know is that it

2151.79 --> 2157.819
is observed in a very persistent angular

2154.94 --> 2163.43
pattern in relation to the observer on

2157.819 --> 2167.27
the earth that's it the rest is all

2163.43 --> 2169.0099999999998
presupposed because yeah

2167.27 --> 2171.319
there's evidence that when you go up

2169.01 --> 2174.349
they're no longer there that doesn't

2171.319 --> 2177.619
make any consistent sense with the

2174.349 --> 2180.05
presupposition that they are insanely

2177.619 --> 2181.73
far away and that lights just shining

2180.05 --> 2183.65
straight towards the earth and you see

2181.73 --> 2185.72
it on the earth but when you go up there

2183.65 --> 2189.109
you wouldn't see it anymore doesn't make

2185.72 --> 2191.9599999999996
any sense besides does it make any sense

2189.109 --> 2195.94
concerning light at all because I don't

2191.96 --> 2195.94
think like can actually go that far

2204.93 --> 2211.8599999999997
yeah that's right Daniel when you go up

2207.45 --> 2215.5499999999997
there balloon wise you know you have a

2211.86 --> 2217.8900000000003
black sky and you have no stars you

2215.55 --> 2220.44
might have noticed several of these

2217.89 --> 2226.0499999999997
balloon videos they've been out there

2220.44 --> 2229.23
for five years yeah you still may see

2226.05 --> 2231.36
the Sun you may see a very small moon

2229.23 --> 2233.34
for example you might even see some

2231.36 --> 2235.59
weird

2233.34 --> 2238.8
for example Venus or something that

2235.59 --> 2242.34
that's but Venus is weird Venus is very

2238.8 --> 2246.3
odd like phenomenon it's unusually

2242.34 --> 2248.4
bright in the morning so you may see

2246.3 --> 2250.0800000000004
those but you don't see stars even

2248.4 --> 2252.9
though the sky is black it doesn't make

2250.08 --> 2256.23
any damn sense that's what I saw what

2252.9 --> 2258.0
does that balloon footage yes I've ever

2256.23 --> 2260.36
looked through a telescope that's right

2258.0 --> 2260.36
yeah

2268.79 --> 2275.33
well Daniel doesn't really make does it

2272.24 --> 2278.99
really matter whether it is a night time

2275.33 --> 2282.04
balloon or a day time balloon when if it

2278.99 --> 2285.5899999999997
goes up high enough there will be a

2282.04 --> 2288.41
majority-black perfectly black space

2285.59 --> 2290.36
above does it make sense that you

2288.41 --> 2294.44
wouldn't see stars in that even though

2290.36 --> 2297.86
it's black does that make sense no no it

2294.44 --> 2301.46
doesn't the Stars supposed to come out

2297.86 --> 2303.4100000000003
when it is black and the stars do come

2301.46 --> 2305.69
out when it is black even though at the

2303.41 --> 2308.48
horizon at some location there still may

2305.69 --> 2311.63
be some sunlight shimmering over the

2308.48 --> 2313.97
horizon if it is black you will see the

2311.63 --> 2316.01
stars well when you go up in that

2313.97 --> 2318.6699999999996
balloon or the balloon footage we've

2316.01 --> 2324.8
seen there's black up there and no stars

2318.67 --> 2327.86
so they are not lights in a fixed

2324.8 --> 2330.86
position that you're looking at that are

2327.86 --> 2332.96
shining down no they are optical

2330.86 --> 2335.36
phenomena light based phenomena that

2332.96 --> 2337.85
have a specific angular relation to the

2335.36 --> 2342.85
observer in relation to the position on

2337.85 --> 2342.85
the earth not above it on it

2354.43 --> 2358.2889999999998
you're an idiot Daniel

2363.69 --> 2367.98
I didn't claim it was during the night I

2366.18 --> 2371.45
didn't claim it was during the day I

2367.98 --> 2375.829
just claimed I said there is a majority

2371.45 --> 2378.5099999999998
pure black on camera with that footage

2375.829 --> 2380.28
there should be stars in there because

2378.51 --> 2382.7700000000004
that is the condition when stars come

2380.28 --> 2386.0690000000004
out on the earth when the sky is black

2382.77 --> 2391.109
no matter what unless it is all clouded

2386.069 --> 2394.14
up you see stars okay so there is no

2391.109 --> 2397.049
excuse not to see stars when you see a

2394.14 --> 2400.49
big part of the sky being black there is

2397.049 --> 2400.49
no excuse for it

2400.75 --> 2407.809
[Music]

2409.569 --> 2413.8089999999997
are you gonna say that another time

2412.4 --> 2416.54
Daniel because if you are I'm gonna

2413.809 --> 2421.21
block you again because you can keep

2416.54 --> 2424.16
that [ __ ] to yourself please I

2421.21 --> 2425.54
already told you has nothing to do with

2424.16 --> 2428.8089999999997
the brightness of the earth if they're

2425.54 --> 2431.27
still light shimmering over the horizon

2428.809 --> 2435.6090000000004
from the Sun when the rest of the sky is

2431.27 --> 2438.74
black and you still see the stars earth

2435.609 --> 2441.2
illumination does not black out the

2438.74 --> 2444.1699999999996
stars that is [ __ ]

2441.2 --> 2445.1899999999996
no not scared to check I know it's wrong

2444.17 --> 2454.64
you're wrong

2445.19 --> 2457.0
oh really okay well show me then where

2454.64 --> 2457.0
is it

2460.53 --> 2465.96
so okay okay well you know what you know

2463.71 --> 2469.95
what Daniel let me put it in another way

2465.96 --> 2473.9700000000003
right so during a daytime balloon launch

2469.95 --> 2480.72
right a daytime Sun is right above you

2473.97 --> 2482.97
daytime daytime daytime okay you

2480.72 --> 2486.18
launched a balloon guess what happens

2482.97 --> 2491.22
goes high up you get probably two-thirds

2486.18 --> 2496.35
above you above is black there's no star

2491.22 --> 2500.2799999999997
so where are the stars Daniel when it's

2496.35 --> 2503.85
black it's not being shined away it's

2500.28 --> 2508.8300000000004
not like purple or very dark blue no

2503.85 --> 2512.0
it's black black pitch black so where

2508.83 --> 2512.0
are the stars Daniel

2523.61 --> 2530.3
don't with you [ __ ] come back to the

2527.85 --> 2530.2999999999997
next time

2534.68 --> 2545.0389999999998
why would I be you happy for that mr.

2537.539 --> 2547.23
Cheswick now it's only everything is

2545.039 --> 2548.9990000000003
black and when you go up really high

2547.23 --> 2553.589
during the daytime and it's not

2548.999 --> 2554.43
everything it's like 2/3 so that doesn't

2553.589 --> 2558.48
make any sense

2554.43 --> 2561.1499999999996
you know the day time doesn't really

2558.48 --> 2563.4
matter if you were in the daytime and

2561.15 --> 2565.38
you would be away from Earth or whatever

2563.4 --> 2569.5190000000002
if you even presuppose that it is

2565.38 --> 2575.13
possible okay then you would still see

2569.519 --> 2577.6499999999996
stars because only daytime blue is the

2575.13 --> 2579.329
thing that pretty much supposedly gets

2577.65 --> 2581.7000000000003
away the stars and then it makes sense

2579.329 --> 2583.1400000000003
because the blue is light it's like

2581.7 --> 2586.14
refraction or whatever you're gonna

2583.14 --> 2590.069
presuppose that is right but if it's

2586.14 --> 2593.97
black there is no excuse not to see the

2590.069 --> 2599.97
stars so that's the last time I'm saying

2593.97 --> 2602.6699999999996
that no water above eighty I'm not

2599.97 --> 2604.859
talking about that I don't ascribe to

2602.67 --> 2607.109
that I don't ascribe to a dome with

2604.859 --> 2610.98
freakin water above it okay good luck

2607.109 --> 2613.43
with that get to the dome first and then

2610.98 --> 2613.43
we'll talk

2624.47 --> 2628.73
yeah you may have separated the waters

2626.599 --> 2632.869
but you don't even know literally than

2628.73 --> 2635.569
what that means so he doesn't say that

2632.869 --> 2638.27
he separated the waters and then put air

2635.569 --> 2641.3
in between the waters where the air is

2638.27 --> 2643.93
under the water and above the water

2641.3 --> 2646.9300000000003
that's not described in the Bible so

2643.93 --> 2646.93
yeah

2656.39 --> 2660.47
kind of [ __ ] statement

2663.01 --> 2668.05
ranty joining forces with the freemason

2666.43 --> 2673.2
sorry what are you or [ __ ] or

2668.05 --> 2673.2000000000003
something seriously what's your issue

2679.75 --> 2685.66
yeah Aleksander light-water I'm not

2681.91 --> 2690.45
saying that either what I'm saying is

2685.66 --> 2695.109
you don't know what that meant

2690.45 --> 2697.45
because if you could if you would you

2695.109 --> 2700.0
would because it was much more specific

2697.45 --> 2707.41
saying it in for example the way I just

2700.0 --> 2715.06
described it it didn't of course mr.

2707.41 --> 2718.93
Cheswick whatever man I give a [ __ ] he

2715.06 --> 2719.7999999999997
can do whatever he likes if he wants to

2718.93 --> 2722.71
be part of that Club

2719.8 --> 2725.26
well blessings to him he knows what

2722.71 --> 2726.52
happens when you try to get to 33 that's

2725.26 --> 2729.28
when you're into big trouble he's

2726.52 --> 2732.34
probably not gonna do that so look up

2729.28 --> 2734.92
until 30 to Freemasonry is just as good

2732.34 --> 2743.38
as completely harmless it's just a hobby

2734.92 --> 2746.38
and a group of people you know I I

2743.38 --> 2749.17
actually would be inclined to join them

2746.38 --> 2752.02
if I'd had any purpose that it would

2749.17 --> 2753.88
serve to me like for example good

2752.02 --> 2758.2599999999998
contacts because a lot of these people

2753.88 --> 2762.119
are professionals in things and they're

2758.26 --> 2766.03
not all evil or that kind of nonsense

2762.119 --> 2770.19
so freemasons look my grandpa was a

2766.03 --> 2775.9
freemason okay freemasons are not

2770.19 --> 2778.54
terrible it's just it's a big group and

2775.9 --> 2780.82
there are some freaks in there

2778.54 --> 2782.29
especially in the high power and there's

2780.82 --> 2785.17
because of it there's just a lot of

2782.29 --> 2790.48
weird [ __ ] basically hiding in

2785.17 --> 2792.13
Freemasonry we're all called secrets and

2790.48 --> 2795.33
[ __ ] and that makes it all very

2792.13 --> 2800.98
mysterious and appealing to newbies but

2795.33 --> 2804.0
most of it is just like a boys club you

2800.98 --> 2807.39
know it's not that it's not that

2804.0 --> 2807.39
horrific or anything

2815.99 --> 2822.68
oh well a gem look I'm sure that as I

2820.339 --> 2825.38
said there are some real freaks out

2822.68 --> 2827.33
there especially the ones that are

2825.38 --> 2830.2400000000002
aiming for the highest that are aiming

2827.33 --> 2837.23
for power like freemasons that are for

2830.24 --> 2839.6899999999996
example also Satanist or secretly so or

2837.23 --> 2841.52
whatever well people go to that type of

2839.69 --> 2844.73
thing for all kinds of reasons sometimes

2841.52 --> 2847.7599999999998
it's like an initiation thing for other

2844.73 --> 2850.76
stuff and the same goes for the the

2847.76 --> 2852.5
garden Aryan week has for example that's

2850.76 --> 2855.1090000000004
also like a big group

2852.5 --> 2857.119
if the Freemasons you have the weakest

2855.109 --> 2862.99
from the old guard to wake us basically

2857.119 --> 2867.7400000000002
and and you have bunch of Satanists now

2862.99 --> 2870.64
more atheist Satanist and among all of

2867.74 --> 2873.6189999999997
them you have the real monstrous freaks

2870.64 --> 2883.1299999999997
but that doesn't make them all like that

2873.619 --> 2887.0
again overgeneralization God um can you

2883.13 --> 2890.359
please not put that [ __ ] down in my chat

2887.0 --> 2894.22
thank you very much whether it be true

2890.359 --> 2894.22
or not thank you

2898.89 --> 2904.14
I think that's [ __ ] can you please

2901.14 --> 2908.27
stop asking these dumb questions it's

2904.14 --> 2908.27
really getting annoying mr. Cheswick

2917.92 --> 2924.4900000000002
sergeant that doesn't that's a

2921.74 --> 2924.49
ridiculous

2927.99 --> 2933.9599999999996
I would mark sergeant get aparted in a

2930.54 --> 2939.08
Star Wars film I mean hey good for him

2933.96 --> 2939.08
you know but it's just weird

2948.94 --> 2956.23
no AGM I just don't want to talk about

2952.69 --> 2960.04
vile torturous monstrous things all day

2956.23 --> 2963.93
and describe them okay I am highly

2960.04 --> 2966.4
repulsed I go into a berserk King rage

2963.93 --> 2969.3999999999996
when I get confronted with that [ __ ] you

2966.4 --> 2972.01
saw that happening okay it's called a t2

2969.4 --> 2977.77
you might want to refresh your memory at

2972.01 --> 2980.8
that all right that's it

2977.77 --> 2994.12
piss off idiot get the [ __ ] out of my

2980.8 --> 2997.23
hangout [ __ ] yes I'm going

2994.12 --> 2997.23
Araki elope

3015.369 --> 3026.509
now berserker rage is never for the win

3019.779 --> 3029.479
that's ridiculous it might be for the

3026.509 --> 3030.0190000000002
win in your last few moments and that's

3029.479 --> 3034.479
it

3030.019 --> 3034.479
there is no win in a Burger King rage

3050.89 --> 3057.85
look EDM I know all that [ __ ] okay I

3054.73 --> 3062.92
know all of it I've I know things I will

3057.85 --> 3065.68
never share with anyone because even

3062.92 --> 3070.71
knowing that I have a memory somewhere

3065.68 --> 3074.1699999999996
concealed for me of some things is just

3070.71 --> 3077.41
I'm not gonna share that because I am

3074.17 --> 3080.04
NOT a freaking masochist sadist okay and

3077.41 --> 3085.0
you shouldn't be either

3080.04 --> 3088.0299999999997
that these things go on yeah and it goes

3085.0 --> 3090.49
more vile and more repulsive than any of

3088.03 --> 3097.23
you can ever imagine no matter how hard

3090.49 --> 3100.9599999999996
you try okay but it doesn't help you the

3097.23 --> 3104.41
disgusting vileness of it is part of the

3100.96 --> 3106.27
weapon of it and every time you get

3104.41 --> 3109.7799999999997
slammed with it two things can happen

3106.27 --> 3114.7599999999998
you either turn into a raging beast or

3109.78 --> 3116.59
you turn into a psychopath and you numb

3114.76 --> 3120.01
down and you get used to it and then

3116.59 --> 3121.84
you've perpetuated doesn't mean that you

3120.01 --> 3124.03
are gonna literally do that but you are

3121.84 --> 3126.25
gonna perpetuate that horror level

3124.03 --> 3128.32
because you're numb down and then you're

3126.25 --> 3130.66
gonna basically numb everyone down and

3128.32 --> 3133.42
then it will split up that is what

3130.66 --> 3137.98
happens when you start to speak out

3133.42 --> 3140.65
horrific disgusting godless stuff that's

3137.98 --> 3144.31
what happens it's the curse of it and

3140.65 --> 3150.04
the Satanists they take it like insane

3144.31 --> 3152.2599999999998
maniacs because they know those side

3150.04 --> 3155.71
effects they know that it will naturally

3152.26 --> 3157.9300000000003
want to hide in the common human that

3155.71 --> 3160.57
does not mean that just spouting it out

3157.93 --> 3162.97
all day is gonna actually help the only

3160.57 --> 3165.76
thing that really helps is pinpointing

3162.97 --> 3171.6699999999996
is actually figuring out who they are

3165.76 --> 3177.3100000000004
and be certain and be prepared and taken

3171.67 --> 3180.58
down somehow judicially if possible but

3177.31 --> 3184.63
you have to take notice that a lot of

3180.58 --> 3188.2599999999998
the hype and fear of it is unspecial

3184.63 --> 3190.9900000000002
is over generalized and suggested to be

3188.26 --> 3198.9100000000003
much more around than in reality it

3190.99 --> 3203.95
really is all right okay

3198.91 --> 3212.97
I'll add you Riley it's good to have a

3203.95 --> 3214.81
good distraction Hey hello

3212.97 --> 3224.35
[ __ ] hell Monica near me

3214.81 --> 3226.42
yeah no swearing please all right hold

3224.35 --> 3235.36
on I need to fix my Skype window for a

3226.42 --> 3245.5
moment anyway you don't really care at

3235.36 --> 3247.2400000000002
this moment I'm still having a show all

3245.5 --> 3250.09
right sure

3247.24 --> 3251.89
well was there anything else you wanted

3250.09 --> 3266.34
to join for but tell me of telling me

3251.89 --> 3266.3399999999997
that I have no idea

3277.17 --> 3280.38
cat words

3308.4 --> 3316.09
it's a weird question so I personally

3312.49 --> 3318.1899999999996
think it's kind of misleading you asked

3316.09 --> 3320.73
it like a long no but you asked it a

3318.19 --> 3326.23
long time ago and explained exactly why

3320.73 --> 3328.08
that's kind of like weird

3326.23 --> 3330.94
[Music]

3328.08 --> 3332.77
well you're automatically presupposing

3330.94 --> 3336.07
that there is a point where sunlight is

3332.77 --> 3351.55
no longer reaching the ice you have no

3336.07 --> 3356.44
proof of that I don't believe a word of

3351.55 --> 3359.98
it no it's not well we're practically on

3356.44 --> 3362.2000000000003
the same area and over here oh yeah

3359.98 --> 3364.42
sunburn you better damn well believe it

3362.2 --> 3367.66
so that's nonsense take a look you can

3364.42 --> 3407.7400000000002
have sunburn too much rain on average so

3367.66 --> 3409.39
you'll never get it no longer providing

3407.74 --> 3411.1299999999997
heat it's just freezing cold is still

3409.39 --> 3413.62
lit but it's not provided in heat and

3411.13 --> 3415.09
then I starts to form and then once I

3413.62 --> 3417.13
starts to form you've got a barrier

3415.09 --> 3420.039
there and that is a logical

3417.13 --> 3422.2000000000003
reasonable assumption to make based on

3420.039 --> 3424.1800000000003
the proximity of the Sun and all I

3422.2 --> 3425.8289999999997
wanted into addresses is there a point

3424.18 --> 3428.3489999999997
where the Sun can no longer melt the ice

3425.829 --> 3430.0
and it wouldn't give me an answer now I

3428.349 --> 3432.5190000000002
think there must be because we have a

3430.0 --> 3440.5
proximal relationship with the Sun but

3432.519 --> 3451.1189999999997
we read with me yeah we do yeah of

3440.5 --> 3453.369
course we do the Sun sure but we do have

3451.119 --> 3455.2000000000003
great gradients of where the sunlight

3453.369 --> 3457.63
causes sunburn to where the sunlight

3455.2 --> 3459.5789999999997
doesn't cause sunburn and if you go the

3457.63 --> 3461.17
opposite end then you can logically and

3459.579 --> 3462.7000000000003
reasonably predict that there will be a

3461.17 --> 3464.9700000000003
point where the Sun could no longer melt

3462.7 --> 3464.97
the ice

3473.12 --> 3482.27
John but at least we could chuck

3476.57 --> 3483.98
contested always good game I don't know

3482.27 --> 3486.5
you're right I don't know you're right

3483.98 --> 3488.51
it is a pre assumption that if we carry

3486.5 --> 3490.55
down heading north that eventually the

3488.51 --> 3492.9500000000003
Sun would be too weak to be able to melt

3490.55 --> 3495.17
the ice or to stop the water from

3492.95 --> 3501.7
turning into ice I'm not saying it

3495.17 --> 3501.7000000000003
absolutely definitely is well uh on/off

3503.47 --> 3507.7599999999998
no I'm saying that there is there is

3515.39 --> 3519.83
my point is that there is a point where

3517.52 --> 3521.9
the Sun can no longer stop the water

3519.83 --> 3523.49
from being a liquid state because it

3521.9 --> 3525.38
doesn't give the water enough heat to

3523.49 --> 3527.5699999999997
mate and it makes it it allows the water

3525.38 --> 3529.58
to change from a liquid into a solid

3527.57 --> 3531.4100000000003
because it isn't cloaks it's not getting

3529.58 --> 3534.74
enough heat from the Sun now I may be

3531.41 --> 3536.96
wrong but my my basis is based in logic

3534.74 --> 3538.91
and reason rather than evidence but that

3536.96 --> 3540.41
does seem to be some evidence for the

3538.91 --> 3542.54
idea that cuz we do have polar bears

3540.41 --> 3545.45
apparently in the north and they do walk

3542.54 --> 3555.08
around on ice sheets so there is the

3545.45 --> 3556.0699999999997
does seem to sure my point is I was

3555.08 --> 3557.81
trying to get him to answer that

3556.07 --> 3559.88
question is there a logical and

3557.81 --> 3562.13
reasonable point where the Sun can fail

3559.88 --> 3564.23
to meet it failed to stop the water from

3562.13 --> 3568.7200000000003
turning into ice and he won't answer me

3564.23 --> 3568.72
now I don't know what's all there

3585.859 --> 3588.43
maybe

3593.15 --> 3595.7200000000003
maybe

3597.21 --> 3609.63
be true I don't know if it is or is not

3598.77 --> 3611.97
my point yeah but my point is this the

3609.63 --> 3615.2400000000002
sunlight in the desert is warm and hot

3611.97 --> 3618.12
things in England it's still warm

3615.24 --> 3620.3399999999997
it doesn't burn it I'm having a bit of

3618.12 --> 3622.29
mic problems because apparently people

3620.34 --> 3624.33
are hanging out hearing my echo so I

3622.29 --> 3627.57
turn it off you could still hear me I

3624.33 --> 3633.66
thought I was at going through the other

3627.57 --> 3635.9100000000003
feed apparently not right okay I don't

3633.66 --> 3638.85
know can I double check please in chat

3635.91 --> 3642.5099999999998
did you hear anything I say or was just

3638.85 --> 3644.43
completely muted really quiet okay

3642.51 --> 3646.0800000000004
right okay well now I'm back to normal

3644.43 --> 3653.33
again but apparently there is some kind

3646.08 --> 3653.33
of echo so I have to do sorry continue

3659.78 --> 3665.55
turning into a solid logically

3662.55 --> 3689.4
reasonably I'd like to see if that's the

3665.55 --> 3698.03
same North and South exist Oh God good I

3689.4 --> 3698.03
need to go shopping

3705.94 --> 3721.91
have you yeah yeah alright so it's a

3713.24 --> 3724.31
screen share now our wind yeah thanks

3721.91 --> 3733.7
Sean tip Tibbets for a super chef

3724.31 --> 3735.41
donation much appreciated oh alright and

3733.7 --> 3740.99
share screens okay so if you do on there

3735.41 --> 3748.3999999999996
yeah I can see you man if I open up this

3740.99 --> 3752.4799999999996
bear with me I know you're gonna love

3748.4 --> 3754.85
this out I found some you're presenting

3752.48 --> 3756.62
the intent right are you gonna maximize

3754.85 --> 3759.44
it because otherwise you're going to see

3756.62 --> 3761.7799999999997
everything yeah yeah yeah that's okay

3759.44 --> 3765.98
this is this is this is my school

3761.78 --> 3767.84
textbooks 1990-91 from when I was in top

3765.98 --> 3771.56
infinite I can see it just you're not

3767.84 --> 3774.6200000000003
presenting it just you know no you're

3771.56 --> 3780.5
presenting the entire screen except what

3774.62 --> 3794.18
you're gonna show me you're sliding it

3780.5 --> 3801.23
outside of the screen oh yeah stop

3794.18 --> 3804.71
screen share free screen share only seen

3801.23 --> 3807.56
the one that should be okay why are you

3804.71 --> 3810.41
seeing these the Skype screen now yeah

3807.56 --> 3813.47
I'm seeing your desktop with some audio

3810.41 --> 3819.5
thing and the Hangout or the YouTube

3813.47 --> 3823.58
window that's it alright man maybe I'll

3819.5 --> 3825.22
have to do on this one than some reason

3823.58 --> 3828.5
skypes Nelson right can you see that

3825.22 --> 3830.54
look when you share a screen you can

3828.5 --> 3832.88
choose between share screen and share

3830.54 --> 3835.5099999999998
application window so you can actually

3832.88 --> 3835.51
choose

3835.589 --> 3844.69
right right yeah I got him so this is

3839.829 --> 3853.9
taken from 1991 right I think it's about

3844.69 --> 3856.0
1991 right this is my old work is made

3853.9 --> 3859.839
up of layers of rock the first two

3856.0 --> 3862.06
layers of rock is caused across 260

3859.839 --> 3864.31
kilometers thick we we live on this

3862.06 --> 3864.7599999999998
beneath the crust is a layer called the

3864.31 --> 3867.49
mantle

3864.76 --> 3869.1400000000003
it is nearly 3,000 kilometers thick near

3867.49 --> 3871.24
the top of the mantle some of the rocks

3869.14 --> 3873.67
are so hot they have melted we can

3871.24 --> 3878.5
become liquid is it's like hot toffee

3873.67 --> 3880.4500000000003
the outer core is also probably made of

3878.5 --> 3882.91
liquid or molten iron it is also

3880.45 --> 3885.0099999999998
probably about 2,000 kilometers thick at

3882.91 --> 3887.46
the very center is the core itself it is

3885.01 --> 3890.53
solid and made of iron and nickel

3887.46 --> 3892.03
excellent 20 out of 20 I got given for

3890.53 --> 3894.4
this look at the quality of the drawer

3892.03 --> 3897.03
in zero I impressed myself at this it is

3894.4 --> 3899.829
really good yeah I agree

3897.03 --> 3909.28
the first of october crystal plates and

3899.829 --> 3913.0890000000004
then above holy [ __ ] that craters like

3909.28 --> 3920.05
really fast that's like an open wound

3913.089 --> 3921.849
type of volcano there that's the case

3920.05 --> 3936.6400000000003
we're [ __ ] because that's like such a

3921.849 --> 3938.619
wide open entry very good work don't let

3936.64 --> 3940.569
your writing slip and write any means

3938.619 --> 3943.26
and then they're testing paper planes

3940.569 --> 3945.7599999999998
check this out rate is used

3943.26 --> 3947.17
investigation and then what happened

3945.76 --> 3950.1400000000003
these are the results and then what I

3947.17 --> 3952.2400000000002
found out and so I've been science in

3950.14 --> 3954.1299999999997
name before I'm excuse me to a better

3952.24 --> 3955.5989999999997
standard the ball is off because at

3954.13 --> 3957.579
least don't follow in a method of some

3955.599 --> 3961.51
kind yeah more than what you see from

3957.579 --> 3964.69
the board as I win this is Melissa's my

3961.51 --> 3965.5190000000002
plane 27th of November that was my plane

3964.69 --> 3967.7690000000002
design

3965.519 --> 3970.3799999999997
again operators use investigation

3967.769 --> 3972.269
there's my results why I found out a

3970.38 --> 3974.279
paper plane flies because of the air

3972.269 --> 3976.919
going over and below the plane is the

3974.279 --> 3978.739
plane airborne the designs improve to

3976.919 --> 3982.8799999999997
play in the planes performance

3978.739 --> 3986.219
imaginative work I've got another one

3982.88 --> 3989.579
the Sun is a star not a planet as some

3986.219 --> 3991.679
people think that's on the center of our

3989.579 --> 3993.989
solar system the Sun keep the planets it

3991.679 --> 4000.409
mean its orbits the Sun is made up of

3993.989 --> 4003.259
gasses copied our system right this is

4000.409 --> 4012.369
my son photosphere prominences you

4003.259 --> 4012.369
forgot the sunspots oh wait yeah you do

4012.699 --> 4021.039
information he says September can light

4016.88 --> 4024.8900000000003
rays bend right investigation

4021.039 --> 4026.329
methodology this one's a bit blurred but

4024.89 --> 4029.0589999999997
I did take a picture of the next thing

4026.329 --> 4031.039
right which light travels in straight

4029.059 --> 4037.429
lines and the teachers had very good

4031.039 --> 4039.199
work winky wonky lines and we see

4037.429 --> 4041.569
objects because light is scattered off

4039.199 --> 4043.579
them and into our eyes this lets us see

4041.569 --> 4045.649
objects as they really are supportive

4043.579 --> 4047.8390000000004
bends light rays and this allows us to

4045.649 --> 4049.939
see around corners apparently this is

4047.839 --> 4052.069
called refraction so we can see round

4049.939 --> 4068.029
the corner of the earth through the

4052.069 --> 4070.909
ocean because it was really funny when I

4068.029 --> 4073.759
was going through it yeah I'm almost

4070.909 --> 4076.279
disappointed you didn't have a density

4073.759 --> 4079.959
experiment with eggs and water in there

4076.279 --> 4082.639
you know it would fit in there perfectly

4079.959 --> 4084.1989999999996
we did stuff in chemistry to do with

4082.639 --> 4085.609
flow and stuff I remember the lesson but

4084.199 --> 4087.469
I can't remember what it was about now I

4085.609 --> 4088.969
think we are a cork and I think we had a

4087.469 --> 4090.05
few other bits and pieces and I remember

4088.969 --> 4092.09
doing it but I did

4090.05 --> 4094.3700000000003
find any paperwork on it so it obviously

4092.09 --> 4097.359
didn't exist oh by the way thank you

4094.37 --> 4099.95
retro bill for the super chair donation

4097.359 --> 4105.799
much appreciated now this is

4099.95 --> 4109.54
entertainment indeed yeah I I wish I had

4105.799 --> 4113.15
some of my older school work books

4109.54 --> 4115.64
because I yeah especially during a

4113.15 --> 4118.969999999999
specific school time period there was

4115.64 --> 4124.609
like mythology we made mythology related

4118.97 --> 4128.33
drawings and I drew like a giant versus

4124.609 --> 4132.08
humans fight in a Roman setting and the

4128.33 --> 4138.16
teacher was like what Giants really I

4132.08 --> 4142.49
was yeah definitely like Romans fighting

4138.16 --> 4147.049
like more tribal Giants among the Goths

4142.49 --> 4150.139999999999
and everyone that was drawing that [ __ ]

4147.049 --> 4153.23
I wish I still had that I couldn't find

4150.14 --> 4154.9400000000005
it back I have a lot of it saved up but

4153.23 --> 4158.66
some of its just missing I don't know

4154.94 --> 4166.5199999999995
where it ended up would be really cool

4158.66 --> 4169.639999999999
to show that oh my god Riley has his own

4166.52 --> 4172.280000000001
face on his desktop watch my channel are

4169.64 --> 4176.5
we care enough but my face on my desktop

4172.28 --> 4176.5
for four years

4176.6 --> 4180.47
[Music]

4179.319 --> 4183.5
mm-hmm

4180.47 --> 4201.35
any signs of Nathan they're starting up

4183.5 --> 4207.64
a show when it's all hmm anymore

4201.35 --> 4211.46
all right well more time for me and you

4207.64 --> 4214.33
yeah chocolate if you want to come on as

4211.46 --> 4214.33
well there will be fun

4214.55 --> 4225.4800000000005
bring him in a while

4221.619 --> 4225.48
all right another time

4239.09 --> 4246.13
a chocolate good morning Oh

4249.68 --> 4261.97
kantaria you there now you're on mute

4267.05 --> 4271.45
yeah

4269.35 --> 4281.2300000000005
you seem to have some sound issues

4271.45 --> 4286.51
chocolate maybe try to rejoin are you

4281.23 --> 4294.9
still there writing I sound is not

4286.51 --> 4294.900000000001
coming through magic I needed

4297.21 --> 4303.63
hmm right retro bill says please show

4301.56 --> 4307.31
your old notebook someday yeah I will

4303.63 --> 4310.17
but there most of it is all just in

4307.31 --> 4312.84
boxes in storage and I have a lot of

4310.17 --> 4315.15
those and a lot of interesting books

4312.84 --> 4318.51
like books on different types of

4315.15 --> 4320.25
crystals and everything and yeah there I

4318.51 --> 4322.14
got a lot of stuff to go through but I

4320.25 --> 4324.6
can't really reach it I'll have to save

4322.14 --> 4328.950000000001
that for a point where I'll actually

4324.6 --> 4331.17
have kind of a house and then I can do

4328.95 --> 4334.71
so much stuff and I can even do it on

4331.17 --> 4341.28
the show all kinds of things but for now

4334.71 --> 4342.99
I'm gonna be stuck here hmm okay well I

4341.28 --> 4359.13
think chocolates not really gonna join

4342.99 --> 4361.469999999999
then or he's back yep yeah I think I

4359.13 --> 4363.0
think I had too much [ __ ] going on my

4361.47 --> 4372.75
phone cause I was also in with this

4363.0 --> 4374.97
board all right no good never be Karen B

4372.75 --> 4377.76
says he knows he knows I use my own

4374.97 --> 4380.610000000001
thinking my feelings - I know so that

4377.76 --> 4401.31
people know they use me being a faceless

4380.61 --> 4406.41
draw or a warrior faceless warrior book

4401.31 --> 4410.700000000001
I got in like the tail end of it so a

4406.41 --> 4415.38
couple of little cartoons of airplanes

4410.7 --> 4419.9
and [ __ ] just pictures that I drew when

4415.38 --> 4419.900000000001
I was a kid okay

4420.469 --> 4431.309
there's more evidence of all time

4422.729 --> 4432.769
Corriveau was that from 1991 yeah were

4431.309 --> 4436.1990000000005
you even alive Ben chocolate

4432.769 --> 4442.499
how are you talking about what are they

4436.199 --> 4444.239
alive Goldie you kidding right

4442.499 --> 4446.13
I don't know I've just got this feeling

4444.239 --> 4452.699
that you're like in your late 20s and

4446.13 --> 4455.519
maybe earlier he's like 21 nah bro I'm

4452.699 --> 4462.9
like 42 holy [ __ ] meaning are you older

4455.519 --> 4464.67
than me that's why you said so it's so

4462.9 --> 4466.348999999999
you chocolate older than me I mean how's

4464.67 --> 4472.26
it don't know that America's I look

4466.349 --> 4474.929
younger than you yeah you born what do

4472.26 --> 4483.030000000001
you think I don't know I think you're

4474.929 --> 4484.709
around or 1980 ah cheater sorry right so

4483.03 --> 4486.36
I was born in 1980 what month were you

4484.709 --> 4488.67
born February

4486.36 --> 4490.32
oh you're older than me is what swear

4488.67 --> 4492.209
I'm actually the youngest in this yeah

4490.32 --> 4494.61
that's terrible yeah you're the younger

4492.209 --> 4497.699
you're any young one your little babe

4494.61 --> 4499.199
you look baby I can't believe when I

4497.699 --> 4504.839999999999
feel like I'm the oldest of the three of

4499.199 --> 4510.239
us must be there the studies you did get

4504.84 --> 4514.619000000001
old it was my paper on but I do paper

4510.239 --> 4518.159
round's no no it made me age prematurely

4514.619 --> 4520.889
when I was like 15 a lot about 32 whoa

4518.159 --> 4523.679
okay well I'm doing paper round's I'm

4520.889 --> 4526.59
not aging prematurely Thanks thankfully

4523.679 --> 4530.639
I don't think you have the same bad

4526.59 --> 4533.88
wouldn't winters the we get though mmm I

4530.639 --> 4536.150000000001
don't know we haven't had a terrible

4533.88 --> 4538.889
winters that is true

4536.15 --> 4540.478999999999
shout out to Travis he says when Anthony

4538.889 --> 4542.88
says he feels like he's older than you

4540.479 --> 4544.9490000000005
guys he means he feels like he's smarter

4542.88 --> 4548.039
you know what there's probably some

4544.949 --> 4549.808999999999
truth in that Travis I just thought I

4548.039 --> 4552.259999999999
was older than DC I thought I was older

4549.809 --> 4552.26
than both of them

4552.44 --> 4563.19
be a Viking bloody older than all right

4559.28 --> 4567.42
yeah I I feel old but I feel young as

4563.19 --> 4570.0
well so I don't feel any older than 20

4567.42 --> 4572.88
to 23 to be honest I feel just as all as

4570.0 --> 4578.07
I am but I also feel just as young as I

4572.88 --> 4579.900000000001
look simultaneously it's all real that's

4578.07 --> 4582.329
really like which do I pick

4579.9 --> 4584.489
how do people regard me are they gonna

4582.329 --> 4591.329
take me for how old I look or are they

4584.489 --> 4593.629999999999
gonna take me for all I actually am you

4591.329 --> 4596.639
know I'm gonna have to do as well you

4593.63 --> 4597.900000000001
know it's funny I think if if I did like

4596.639 --> 4604.05
a face reveal people what do you even

4597.9 --> 4606.42
believe it was me what why not turn your

4604.05 --> 4608.820000000001
camera on we want to see proof they hear

4606.42 --> 4613.2300000000005
my voice yes sure used to hear my voice

4608.82 --> 4618.53
in there like oh that can't be you you

4613.23 --> 4618.53
guys you guys show yourself

4625.76 --> 4630.63
what do you see on screen DC my screen

4628.86 --> 4634.0199999999995
share is Google odd you see is yourself

4630.63 --> 4637.139
in Skype I see an icon of myself in

4634.02 --> 4638.610000000001
Skype right so that's the screen that's

4637.139 --> 4642.4490000000005
sharing all right let me let me show you

4638.61 --> 4643.799999999999
this okay you know when you know like

4642.449 --> 4646.5599999999995
cuz we know that gravity is not a force

4643.8 --> 4648.81
right and they say yeah but it's in a

4646.56 --> 4653.070000000001
pair of no neither a will an apparent

4648.81 --> 4654.329000000001
force it's an aberration yeah well I say

4653.07 --> 4655.92
well apparent forces can't cause

4654.329 --> 4657.54
anything to do something right because

4655.92 --> 4660.6900000000005
they're not real they're apparent right

4657.54 --> 4663.469
check this out now in the context of the

4660.69 --> 4665.848999999999
moon right apparent forces gives you

4663.469 --> 4669.77
apparent forces or fictitious forces

4665.849 --> 4672.6900000000005
right so if gravity is not a force and

4669.77 --> 4675.3
it is by that what they now say is well

4672.69 --> 4678.449
it's an apparent force if you just read

4675.3 --> 4681.54
what it says on Wikipedia right in the

4678.449 --> 4683.82
context of the moon causing the tides on

4681.54 --> 4684.8
the earth if gravity is not a force but

4683.82 --> 4687.23
is a fictitious

4684.8 --> 4690.62
look at this bit it says the fictitious

4687.23 --> 4692.48
force this will be gravity is due to an

4690.62 --> 4694.79
object's inertia when the reference

4692.48 --> 4696.919999999999
frame does not move initially and thus

4694.79 --> 4698.84
begins to excel with accelerate relative

4696.92 --> 4700.46
to the free object that doesn't apply on

4698.84 --> 4703.49
the moon with regards to the tides but

4700.46 --> 4706.82
this videos the fictitious force gravity

4703.49 --> 4709.19
thus does not arise from any physical

4706.82 --> 4711.139999999999
interaction between the two objects so

4709.19 --> 4713.0599999999995
if the if this is true on their model

4711.14 --> 4715.34
what's causing tides

4713.06 --> 4717.89
if the fictitious force known as gravity

4715.34 --> 4719.900000000001
does not arise from any physical

4717.89 --> 4723.05
interaction between the two objects and

4719.9 --> 4725.24
in the context of tides it means that it

4723.05 --> 4728.09
ain't doing anything but in the context

4725.24 --> 4730.78
of Shawn G it also means that Cavendish

4728.09 --> 4733.01
no matter how much she wants to be

4730.78 --> 4734.57
Cavendish isn't doing anything because

4733.01 --> 4737.150000000001
if it's if gravity is a fictitious force

4734.57 --> 4739.46
it doesn't arise from any physical

4737.15 --> 4741.349999999999
interaction between the two objects so

4739.46 --> 4743.15
I'm hoping that bowlers are gonna be

4741.35 --> 4746.17
able to explain to me how the tides work

4743.15 --> 4748.129999999999
and our Cavendish works if gravity is a

4746.17 --> 4750.35
fictitious or an apparent well

4748.13 --> 4752.6
technically this does kind of fall in

4750.35 --> 4755.6
line perfectly with the concept of

4752.6 --> 4759.280000000001
Einsteinian gravity which does not give

4755.6 --> 4762.14
aid causation and merely describes the

4759.28 --> 4764.3
gravity directions are just preset

4762.14 --> 4765.47
through the bending of space kite time

4764.3 --> 4769.6
which cannot be proven

4765.47 --> 4773.72
so it basically discards the necessity

4769.6 --> 4775.97
from being locally proven it just

4773.72 --> 4778.79
doesn't do that and it doesn't replace

4775.97 --> 4782.4800000000005
it so this falls perfectly in line with

4778.79 --> 4784.97
that really it simply does not explain

4782.48 --> 4790.129999999999
anything though it just says it's like

4784.97 --> 4792.320000000001
this it does fall in line with

4790.13 --> 4794.87
Einsteinian I I can see what you're

4792.32 --> 4796.79
saying I agree but if the tides are

4794.87 --> 4798.98
being caused by the moon but there's no

4796.79 --> 4800.75
physical interaction between the moon

4798.98 --> 4802.429999999999
and the tides because gravity is not a

4800.75 --> 4804.71
physical force it's a fictitious force

4802.43 --> 4806.450000000001
and does not arise from a physical

4804.71 --> 4808.13
interaction between the two objects you

4806.45 --> 4809.72
guys can't explain tides well and you

4808.13 --> 4811.16
can't explain Cavendish Oh hold on

4809.72 --> 4813.860000000001
clearly state so let me play devil's

4811.16 --> 4815.78
that forget for a second technically if

4813.86 --> 4818.57
you would say okay the bending of space

4815.78 --> 4822.65
time right so large amounts of mass will

4818.57 --> 4826.73
cause space to bend in order to create

4822.65 --> 4828.71
this gravity effect well if that were

4826.73 --> 4830.57
the case then you could presuppose that

4828.71 --> 4834.58
the moon is a little ball and earth is a

4830.57 --> 4837.86
bigger ball and that they are basically

4834.58 --> 4840.62
also causing this same Einsteinian

4837.86 --> 4843.049999999999
gravity action over a distance on each

4840.62 --> 4845.66
other and that effect is what we would

4843.05 --> 4852.650000000001
be then pulling the water towards the

4845.66 --> 4854.72
middle of them between but yeah it

4852.65 --> 4856.879999999999
doesn't make any sense you know what it

4854.72 --> 4861.95
technically that could happen but it's

4856.88 --> 4864.71
all it's all presupposed that's what my

4861.95 --> 4866.8099999999995
point see I could explain it through

4864.71 --> 4869.12
Einstein in gravity but it doesn't

4866.81 --> 4872.240000000001
actually give physical proof it's always

4869.12 --> 4875.24
going to be a an stein Ian based just so

4872.24 --> 4878.66
a story that can structurally work out

4875.24 --> 4882.16
to seem to make sense but it's never

4878.66 --> 4889.8099999999995
going to be a true causal proof for it

4882.16 --> 4893.3
so but I can't explain what we saying I

4889.81 --> 4895.67
was just just say so how many bodies

4893.3 --> 4899.08
would have to be bending space-time for

4895.67 --> 4901.76
there to be tides on different sides

4899.08 --> 4904.49
quote-unquote sides of the planet at the

4901.76 --> 4906.26
same time well I can even just I can

4904.49 --> 4908.48
just so story that away as well I've

4906.26 --> 4910.93
paid a lot of attention to global when

4908.48 --> 4915.11
it comes to that so you can very

4910.93 --> 4917.990000000001
nonsensically I may have to that argue

4915.11 --> 4921.53
that the moon's orbit around Earth will

4917.99 --> 4924.5599999999995
cause like a wave and counter wave

4921.53 --> 4927.8
motion where it would be pulling that

4924.56 --> 4930.47
specific tight piece where it would be

4927.8 --> 4932.150000000001
let go next to it and then as a result

4930.47 --> 4934.85
on the other side it would be the same

4932.15 --> 4936.7699999999995
effect so that's how there could be two

4934.85 --> 4939.530000000001
tides in opposition to one another which

4936.77 --> 4942.400000000001
in real reality measurable reality

4939.53 --> 4946.84
absolutely does not work like that hell

4942.4 --> 4946.839999999999
but that is how you can explain it

4950.07 --> 4954.25
are you still there

4951.64 --> 4960.1
you can also explain it widow unicorn

4954.25 --> 4963.06
farts yeah that's a little it's slightly

4960.1 --> 4965.56
more difficult to suspend your disbelief

4963.06 --> 4968.68
but it's slightly more difficult to

4965.56 --> 4971.320000000001
suspend your disbelief over time and

4968.68 --> 4973.320000000001
like it's like what might as well just

4971.32 --> 4975.639999999999
put on dragon ball and just watch that

4973.32 --> 4977.62
the bending of space-time what they

4975.64 --> 4980.02
actually mean with that is that the

4977.62 --> 4983.74
presence of the mass will have like a

4980.02 --> 4986.35
collective yeah bending effect on

4983.74 --> 4988.719999999999
space-time which will cause that gravity

4986.35 --> 4991.990000000001
to manifest but not directly related

4988.72 --> 4996.820000000001
with the matter but like a collective

4991.99 --> 4999.429999999999
fields behind it that will then all tied

4996.82 --> 5002.79
in together give a direction to that

4999.43 --> 5008.240000000001
that manifestation of the bending of

5002.79 --> 5008.24
space-time and set the apparent gravity

5009.44 --> 5018.99
what is based on space-time is a

5015.93 --> 5024.83
relation between the standard entropic

5018.99 --> 5024.83
progress of matter within volumetric

5025.58 --> 5029.84
yeah location I guess

5034.559 --> 5040.21
okay I'll take your word for it

5037.9 --> 5043.089999999999
that's the only thing I can describe it

5040.21 --> 5045.28
as yeah what is space-time space-time is

5043.09 --> 5050.59
not a singular thing it is a conceptual

5045.28 --> 5056.199
thing that basically connects we have

5050.59 --> 5059.619000000001
volumetric content speciality with the

5056.199 --> 5063.25
entropic progress of matter which is how

5059.619 --> 5065.199
we derive time and if you combine those

5063.25 --> 5068.71
two and then conclude that they are a

5065.199 --> 5070.75
singular actual effect just like they

5068.71 --> 5073.719
presuppose that gravity itself

5070.75 --> 5077.019
originally was a singular effect then

5073.719 --> 5087.219
then you're close to getting into yeah

5077.019 --> 5089.92
explaining how that delusion works right

5087.219 --> 5096.309
but see I could a freaking worked for

5089.92 --> 5098.55
NASA okay I could have done it you sound

5096.309 --> 5101.019
tense I'm smarter than Don Pettit mister

5098.55 --> 5103.179
yeah what happens if you have a leak

5101.019 --> 5105.639
that's right because they're [ __ ]

5103.179 --> 5113.53
maybe maybe there's an escape plan I

5105.639 --> 5115.42
don't know yeah but it's also because

5113.53 --> 5119.679
these people have completely lost their

5115.42 --> 5122.019
minds in corruption they most of them

5119.679 --> 5124.75
probably originally were really smart

5122.019 --> 5126.67
people but they've all become addicted

5124.75 --> 5128.86
to appetites that have been handed to

5126.67 --> 5132.369
them in order to potentially blackmail

5128.86 --> 5135.19
keep them in line and and four and four

5132.369 --> 5140.768999999999
make sure that they enforce the specific

5135.19 --> 5143.379999999999
agenda that is counter freedom so I yeah

5140.769 --> 5146.559
if I did join NASA I'd probably be just

5143.38 --> 5149.05
as [ __ ] as them even though

5146.559 --> 5151.269
originally I was probably pretty smart

5149.05 --> 5154.1990000000005
because she just go dumb corruption

5151.269 --> 5154.1990000000005
makes people dumb

5158.719 --> 5164.999
would you not agree to me somebody's

5161.519 --> 5166.589
saying we just lost the technology I go

5164.999 --> 5167.969
back in the nanosecond that doesn't

5166.589 --> 5169.949
sound like somebody that's smart to me

5167.969 --> 5172.229
now what that sounds somebody it's an

5169.949 --> 5175.289
insult it's a direct insult to the

5172.229 --> 5178.439
people they're literally just saying

5175.289 --> 5181.169
look you people are so freakin dumb not

5178.439 --> 5184.320000000001
getting this that will make a lie that

5181.169 --> 5188.28
is that insulting and you'll eat it

5184.32 --> 5193.219
and you will then start to make up

5188.28 --> 5196.619
excuses for us that's what they're doing

5193.219 --> 5199.53
most of these people have a very high

5196.619 --> 5209.489
level of contempt for the common man and

5199.53 --> 5211.499
women do you understand you can see it

5209.489 --> 5215.218999999999
in their eyes after that they literally

5211.499 --> 5219.329
are suppressing just like like yeah you

5215.219 --> 5222.2390000000005
people are really annoying let me act

5219.329 --> 5224.849
like I'm oh happy and entertaining but

5222.239 --> 5227.6089999999995
yeah I really am actually uncomfortable

5224.849 --> 5229.969
with all this or I'm just going along

5227.609 --> 5232.499000000001
because I have to and I actually heal II

5229.969 --> 5235.199
really hate the people that I'm

5232.499 --> 5237.079
supposedly entertaining right now that's

5235.199 --> 5240.388999999999
what I get every time

5237.079 --> 5246.148999999999
that's what radiates off me when I watch

5240.389 --> 5250.079
all that NASA [ __ ] now you know what I

5246.149 --> 5252.959000000001
mean the the laughter the actual fun is

5250.079 --> 5257.129
never seems to be genuine it's always

5252.959 --> 5262.589
grimace it's always like yeah we were so

5257.129 --> 5264.239
happy yes I just can't stand when I'm

5262.589 --> 5265.949
seeing them interview kids and their

5264.239 --> 5268.888999999999
straight lines are these kids telling

5265.949 --> 5270.808999999999
him about space some [ __ ] medium

5268.889 --> 5272.309
they can't get to but they're gonna say

5270.809 --> 5275.189
in their khakis and pretend they're

5272.309 --> 5278.959
doing 17,500 miles per hour right while

5275.189 --> 5278.959000000001
doing interviews [ __ ]

5279.809 --> 5287.070000000001
did you know that I think I probably

5282.389 --> 5291.329
even talked to like a NASA set up when I

5287.07 --> 5294.9
was young in my school so I talked to an

5291.329 --> 5296.789
astronaut but it was not in in the space

5294.9 --> 5298.619
station because it doesn't exist yet I

5296.789 --> 5300.599
think they were basically doing it in

5298.619 --> 5303.199
the Vomit Comet and suggesting that it

5300.599 --> 5306.27
was that earlier space station that

5303.199 --> 5309.329
nobody really knew about what does it

5306.27 --> 5314.280000000001
named again do you know Riley or

5309.329 --> 5321.929
chocolate what's the space station that

5314.28 --> 5324.32
came before the ISS Space Lab give me a

5321.929 --> 5324.32
second

5327.3 --> 5334.26
anyway there was a supposed thing about

5329.61 --> 5340.679
that before the ISS became a thing it

5334.26 --> 5343.530000000001
was American also and Dutch and when I

5340.679 --> 5346.829
was a kid I think I was it was very

5343.53 --> 5351.139
young so I must have been like eight I

5346.829 --> 5353.67
think or nine me or was it mirror and

5351.139 --> 5357.0
then like yeah we have a special

5353.67 --> 5360.75
opportunity to take you to the TV screen

5357.0 --> 5362.88
and we have like a telephone or a

5360.75 --> 5365.13
microphone and you could talk you can

5362.88 --> 5368.55
actually interact and ask questions to

5365.13 --> 5371.579
these floaty astronauts in their space

5368.55 --> 5377.88
lab and I thought it was awesome it was

5371.579 --> 5381.679
a huge kick for me but yeah as I am I of

5377.88 --> 5384.75
course immediately asked very high tier

5381.679 --> 5387.36
existential questions that were more

5384.75 --> 5389.07
refined than the general public would

5387.36 --> 5391.23
typically aim at them so I just threw it

5389.07 --> 5395.2699999999995
out there you immediately saw like oh oh

5391.23 --> 5398.579
[ __ ] there's somebody really smart here

5395.27 --> 5400.5
how do we carefully answer that that was

5398.579 --> 5402.599
true and I was like why are they

5400.5 --> 5405.57
stuttering like that I really didn't get

5402.599 --> 5408.929
it back then but I did have my own

5405.57 --> 5413.579
interaction and I also that is where I

5408.929 --> 5413.969
first also asked about yeah material and

5413.579 --> 5418.199
free

5413.969 --> 5419.88
faul what happens to it why can why

5418.199 --> 5422.759999999999
doesn't it like why doesn't the water

5419.88 --> 5425.249
float on top of the sand why does it all

5422.76 --> 5427.619000000001
mix up I that was like the first time

5425.249 --> 5431.699
very very young when I got to talk about

5427.619 --> 5434.67
that so I've seen that [ __ ] it was

5431.699 --> 5435.03
demonstrated to me then oh well real

5434.67 --> 5436.769
quick

5435.03 --> 5439.139
shout outs about the science guy who

5436.769 --> 5448.079000000001
says so you talk to someone in space

5439.139 --> 5450.229
live and you still don't get I thought

5448.079 --> 5453.03
it was real

5450.229 --> 5454.26
Bob the science guy still refuses to

5453.03 --> 5456.509999999999
admit that he's wrong over the

5454.26 --> 5458.159000000001
independent variable he won't admit that

5456.51 --> 5460.139
you have to manipulate it to prove the

5458.159 --> 5461.82
cause-and-effect relationship he thinks

5460.139 --> 5470.159000000001
that you can dispense with it eat the

5461.82 --> 5472.018999999999
guy's an autumn [ __ ] I'm just looking

5470.159 --> 5475.228999999999
at it that's what he thinks you can do

5472.019 --> 5478.139
that's why yeah you look at it you see

5475.229 --> 5480.659000000001
something you draw conclusion you test

5478.139 --> 5482.34
if the conclusion matches whatever

5480.659 --> 5484.799999999999
you're going to be doing or whatever

5482.34 --> 5488.28
you're gonna is it gonna happen and then

5484.8 --> 5489.96
you know if it is true in other words if

5488.28 --> 5492.57
there seems to be an apparent

5489.96 --> 5494.67
correlation and then they think that

5492.57 --> 5496.308999999999
that correlation is actually scientific

5494.67 --> 5500.46
proof while scientific proof

5496.309 --> 5504.63
specifically requires causation it calls

5500.46 --> 5508.139
our relation and that's yeah popularly

5504.63 --> 5510.150000000001
forgotten he thinks that times an

5508.139 --> 5514.8
independent variable he's an autumn

5510.15 --> 5517.558999999999
[ __ ] yeah that's good how can time be

5514.8 --> 5519.179
an independent variable and how are you

5517.559 --> 5521.579000000001
even if it was something how are you

5519.179 --> 5523.8
gonna change it are we gonna do this

5521.579 --> 5525.57
it's like John it's like John yeah it's

5523.8 --> 5527.249
like John so did the day if time really

5525.57 --> 5528.869
was an independent variable right that

5527.249 --> 5530.76
would be the cause of everything in

5528.869 --> 5532.829
every scientific experiment ever time

5530.76 --> 5534.539000000001
because that is you presumed cause and

5532.829 --> 5536.549999999999
when you give it a wiggle that we can

5534.539 --> 5538.44
that if you observe the effect that you

5536.55 --> 5540.269
believe you seeing and you give it a

5538.44 --> 5540.928999999999
wiggle and then you prove that that's

5540.269 --> 5544.559
the cause

5540.929 --> 5546.15
well if time was the cause in in any

5544.559 --> 5547.12
experiment because it's the independent

5546.15 --> 5550.0199999999995
variable then

5547.12 --> 5554.5
means that time causes everything

5550.02 --> 5557.68
actually time is always a dependent

5554.5 --> 5560.05
variable always direct or control yeah

5557.68 --> 5563.950000000001
yeah no you can't control it because it

5560.05 --> 5566.62
is constant something that's constantly

5563.95 --> 5569.01
there but it's not but it always has to

5566.62 --> 5573.04
be there and experiment as always a

5569.01 --> 5575.860000000001
setup something happens which requires

5573.04 --> 5578.26
time progress is there's not something

5575.86 --> 5580.15
gonna happen before and if they're

5578.26 --> 5582.400000000001
without time there is no before and

5580.15 --> 5586.15
after an experiment requires before and

5582.4 --> 5590.469999999999
after always so experiment without time

5586.15 --> 5592.0
doesn't he's not an experiment but yeah

5590.47 --> 5595.900000000001
Bob the no science guy doesn't know what

5592.0 --> 5597.31
he's talking about is he in chat now uh

5595.9 --> 5606.969999999999
I don't know

5597.31 --> 5608.68
see comment he's still there why don't

5606.97 --> 5612.900000000001
you joined Bob there's no science guy he

5608.68 --> 5612.900000000001
thinks you spoke to somebody in space

5613.08 --> 5619.15
keep going and someone sent me a link

5617.35 --> 5619.570000000001
from a video that Bob the science guys

5619.15 --> 5621.5199999999995
done

5619.57 --> 5623.53
claiming that quantum eraser lied about

5621.52 --> 5625.72
somewhat he's given me the link to the

5623.53 --> 5629.349999999999
video I've asked for a timestamp for

5625.72 --> 5631.96
where the claim of apparently Bob the

5629.35 --> 5634.3
site Bob the no science guy is proven

5631.96 --> 5637.66
that quantum earaches a lied about

5634.3 --> 5639.7
somewhat now if he's gonna prove that

5637.66 --> 5642.34
somebody's lied about some it he's gotta

5639.7 --> 5645.13
show that the dishonest mental state was

5642.34 --> 5647.2
to deceive rather than just making a

5645.13 --> 5649.27
mistake now I'm pretty sure John's not

5647.2 --> 5650.349999999999
me he not even made a mistake but it

5649.27 --> 5653.35
would be interesting to see what

5650.35 --> 5656.56
perception Bob the Science Guy has for

5653.35 --> 5659.2300000000005
John's proof of mental states to be

5656.56 --> 5661.570000000001
deceiving but if you can give me a time

5659.23 --> 5664.719999999999
something in the video Bob where is it

5661.57 --> 5667.69
it's how about just any claim instead of

5664.72 --> 5669.7300000000005
just a slanderous just so story without

5667.69 --> 5674.95
anything to back it up how about just a

5669.73 --> 5677.669999999999
claim to start out with because I can

5674.95 --> 5680.889
claim that you are a religious zealot

5677.67 --> 5683.59
who's just here to slander and try to

5680.889 --> 5687.55
rake in more cult followers for you

5683.59 --> 5690.07
because that's how you like it you know

5687.55 --> 5692.679
in your not in search of knowledge yours

5690.07 --> 5695.799999999999
in search of confirmation and social

5692.679 --> 5697.84
power so I can claim all that that's

5695.8 --> 5705.78
actually a claim it's not saying is

5697.84 --> 5705.78
dishonest because that it's just lame so

5707.249 --> 5711.63
what's the claim Bob science guy

5715.38 --> 5718.13
new

5721.27 --> 5725.4490000000005
he's saying in chat now he says I've

5723.889 --> 5728.6900000000005
asked him to give me the timestamp um

5725.449 --> 5731.03
and he says it's not a courtroom buddy

5728.69 --> 5732.379999999999
watch the video and learn something I'm

5731.03 --> 5733.82
not gonna watch your video Bob I just

5732.38 --> 5736.6900000000005
want to see what you claim is the lie

5733.82 --> 5739.159
and I want to see what you claim is the

5736.69 --> 5740.419999999999
intention to deceive and if you can't

5739.159 --> 5742.699
give me the timestamp then it obviously

5740.42 --> 5745.159
doesn't exist right so it's just a

5742.699 --> 5746.15
standard slanderous remark it's just

5745.159 --> 5747.94
yeah

5746.15 --> 5751.489
a fart coming out of the wrong side

5747.94 --> 5753.71
that's what it is it's a lot of ballers

5751.489 --> 5756.669999999999
do that they really need to work on

5753.71 --> 5759.02
their diet them a little bit more

5756.67 --> 5762.59
getting schooled by Karen in chat right

5759.02 --> 5764.42
now this is glorious to watch I'm gonna

5762.59 --> 5766.79
keep putting ten pence in Karen sir just

5764.42 --> 5768.679
watch it just attacking because this guy

5766.79 --> 5770.54
is worthy of being attacked because he

5768.679 --> 5773.2390000000005
lies about science to ballers and

5770.54 --> 5776.48
they've all believed in I saw people on

5773.239 --> 5778.848999999999
Jose's chat patting him on the back for

5776.48 --> 5781.459999999999
getting absolutely destroyed by his own

5778.849 --> 5782.96
scientific method by me but will not

5781.46 --> 5784.849
accept that you've got a manipulate the

5782.96 --> 5787.52
independent variable if you don't accept

5784.849 --> 5790.01
that no matter what you lose and I gave

5787.52 --> 5792.56
10 citations all same pretty much the

5790.01 --> 5794.389
same thing and he gave me one which was

5792.56 --> 5795.679
the first page on Google where it said

5794.389 --> 5797.63
that time is always the independent

5795.679 --> 5799.579
variable so all I did was a show that

5797.63 --> 5802.34
time is the the independent variable is

5799.579 --> 5804.079
the presumed cause so if time is the

5802.34 --> 5806.21
independent variable that means that

5804.079 --> 5807.909
means that time causes everything and we

5806.21 --> 5811.28
know that time doesn't cause anything

5807.909 --> 5814.429
okay right the hand look look what he's

5811.28 --> 5815.119
saying know that right what who is this

5814.429 --> 5818.3
guy

5815.119 --> 5821.299999999999
is he a flat earther is he what is this

5818.3 --> 5823.9400000000005
guy third earthers lies about quantum

5821.3 --> 5827.09
mechanics it's perfect English flat

5823.94 --> 5831.129999999999
earthers lies about quantum mechanics

5827.09 --> 5837.71
I'm good at English very good writing me

5831.13 --> 5839.92
hmm and besides well look who is lying

5837.71 --> 5842.54
about quantum mechanics what's the lie

5839.92 --> 5845.2390000000005
you know I have my doubts about quantum

5842.54 --> 5848.06
mechanics and I've talked about that in

5845.239 --> 5850.73
detail with red pill philosophy that

5848.06 --> 5854.030000000001
that really awesome hang out or explain

5850.73 --> 5857.36
it concisely so got an

5854.03 --> 5858.829
thing more specific super cave doesn't

5857.36 --> 5860.509999999999
know one independent variable as either

5858.829 --> 5861.349
and did not manipulate the buoyant force

5860.51 --> 5863.09
super curve

5861.349 --> 5864.860000000001
I put bit of salt in there and added

5863.09 --> 5867.409000000001
mass that changed the pressure and

5864.86 --> 5868.88
dislodged the salt buoyant force didn't

5867.409 --> 5871.098999999999
play any role in it and if it did it

5868.88 --> 5872.900000000001
were a control super curve doesn't

5871.099 --> 5874.789
understand science he's obviously a

5872.9 --> 5876.92
protege of Bob the no science guy

5874.789 --> 5878.57
because anybody that thinks that buoyant

5876.92 --> 5880.039
force was manipulated in thought then

5878.57 --> 5886.07
the egg experiment must be an utter

5880.039 --> 5887.449
[ __ ] rationality sensible says the

5886.07 --> 5889.67
world does not care about what you

5887.449 --> 5891.289
choose the independent variable to be no

5889.67 --> 5892.67
you're right it doesn't but when you

5891.289 --> 5894.079
choose it and then you give it a wiggle

5892.67 --> 5895.34
and then it gives you the effect that

5894.079 --> 5896.449
you believe that you're gonna get when

5895.34 --> 5899.0
you wiggle it then guess what

5896.449 --> 5901.73
you prove causation and you're right the

5899.0 --> 5904.219
F does the world does not care causation

5901.73 --> 5905.69
is only important if you believe that

5904.219 --> 5907.94
you're proving some it and if you can

5905.69 --> 5914.089999999999
prove causation and guess what you can't

5907.94 --> 5917.299999999999
infer it sorry more trolls making videos

5914.09 --> 5921.409000000001
about me how many do I have now I must

5917.3 --> 5924.409000000001
have like at least 30 dedicated videos

5921.409 --> 5927.829
to me of people that I literally don't

5924.409 --> 5930.44
even remember the name about it's

5927.829 --> 5932.75
fascinating all these people really have

5930.44 --> 5938.598999999999
this need to make videos about good old

5932.75 --> 5940.969
me a guy in a room who talks and talks

5938.599 --> 5944.469
about Flat Earth and gives his opinion

5940.969 --> 5946.67
and that apparently is so extremely

5944.469 --> 5949.07
excruciatingly ly triggering to some

5946.67 --> 5953.179
people that there's just people out

5949.07 --> 5956.63
there constantly making really ill

5953.179 --> 5964.039
attempt at videos to try to make me look

5956.63 --> 5966.38
bad or crazy or it's so bizarre it's

5964.039 --> 5969.349
like nobody ever even tried to do that

5966.38 --> 5971.679
to me in my life since I came to Flat

5969.349 --> 5974.389
Earth there's just people that are

5971.679 --> 5978.11
negatively artistically obsessed with

5974.389 --> 5982.1900000000005
flat earthers it's really pervy in a way

5978.11 --> 5986.719
like sometimes these trolls I get this

5982.19 --> 5987.929999999999
weird creepy gay rape feeling from them

5986.719 --> 5991.68
like there are literal

5987.93 --> 5994.29
they just gay people that are just a 1

5991.68 --> 5996.27
or a pin all I can't stand like that I

5994.29 --> 5998.82
think I think many of these people are

5996.27 --> 6001.64
literally that disgusting like really

5998.82 --> 6005.09
disgusting Erie basement-dwelling

6001.64 --> 6008.92
perverts because that's what they act

6005.09 --> 6013.1900000000005
like and that's just this weird

6008.92 --> 6015.56
suppressed passive-aggressive sexual

6013.19 --> 6018.919999999999
thing about them sometimes it's just so

6015.56 --> 6021.410000000001
disgusting but they do it they

6018.92 --> 6022.16
constantly do it and they just can't get

6021.41 --> 6024.22
enough of it

6022.16 --> 6028.639999999999
why do you why do you even pay attention

6024.22 --> 6031.45
I don't I don't but I do sometimes like

6028.64 --> 6034.37
to describe what's really going on and

6031.45 --> 6036.28
despite that I don't actually go out and

6034.37 --> 6039.349999999999
watch these videos because I don't I

6036.28 --> 6044.0
literally don't I don't secretly I say

6039.35 --> 6046.400000000001
no I don't give a [ __ ] if I actually go

6044.0 --> 6049.94
watch it even a secret then there will

6046.4 --> 6052.37
be the knowledge interaction and I they

6049.94 --> 6054.139999999999
will notice that I did give them that

6052.37 --> 6057.26
energy by paying attention so I

6054.14 --> 6059.650000000001
literally discard them from my

6057.26 --> 6064.21
consciousness because there is nothing

6059.65 --> 6067.46
they have be it creative comedic

6064.21 --> 6071.57
criticism or any other fashion that they

6067.46 --> 6076.82
have that I can get anything out it's

6071.57 --> 6079.07
only [ __ ] but I will describe their the

6076.82 --> 6082.969999999999
character that is behind these types of

6079.07 --> 6087.73
action I will share how bad people are

6082.97 --> 6091.52
out there how sick they really are like

6087.73 --> 6094.7
if people would act like that in the

6091.52 --> 6098.0
open there's a big chance they'll either

6094.7 --> 6101.0599999999995
end up in jail if you did that face to

6098.0 --> 6103.61
face or in a mental institute because

6101.06 --> 6107.4400000000005
it's on that level but on the internet

6103.61 --> 6109.849999999999
yeah anonymity and none a minute

6107.44 --> 6113.66
anonymity yeah that's right

6109.85 --> 6115.910000000001
damn that word so I already think some

6113.66 --> 6118.46
of these people need help you did I

6115.91 --> 6122.96
don't stand that

6118.46 --> 6125.63
the motivation to seek a subject or

6122.96 --> 6128.2390000000005
topic that you cannot stand you cannot

6125.63 --> 6130.31
believe in cannot get behind but you

6128.239 --> 6133.489
seek it every day like a psychopath

6130.31 --> 6138.14
that's problematic okay negatively

6133.489 --> 6140.36
obsessed it's like it's actually really

6138.14 --> 6143.360000000001
childish it's and that's why I say it's

6140.36 --> 6147.139999999999
kind of weird gay pervy I feel because

6143.36 --> 6149.2699999999995
it feels like the prepubescent type of

6147.14 --> 6152.3
falling in love with the opposite sex

6149.27 --> 6155.06
and one of the typical things with kids

6152.3 --> 6156.679
boys for example or even girls that

6155.06 --> 6159.650000000001
don't really know about it consciously

6156.679 --> 6161.9
is that they will start to find somebody

6159.65 --> 6165.259999999999
annoying and start to like tease them

6161.9 --> 6168.049999999999
and then later they figure out oh [ __ ] I

6165.26 --> 6171.34
actually find them really attractive so

6168.05 --> 6174.02
I think it is routed in that same very

6171.34 --> 6175.55
juvenile primitive feeling it's

6174.02 --> 6178.219
basically they're they're closed

6175.55 --> 6179.659000000001
mutilated heart sees like this I can't

6178.219 --> 6182.12
stand it and they can't stand them but

6179.659 --> 6185.989
actually I'm kind of aroused because

6182.12 --> 6189.23
they're little children stuck in semi

6185.989 --> 6191.389999999999
adult bodies living a children's life

6189.23 --> 6193.849999999999
polluting themselves mutating their own

6191.39 --> 6196.219
mental capacities more and more becoming

6193.85 --> 6202.610000000001
more and more delusional more aggressive

6196.219 --> 6205.969
more away from humanity and it just

6202.61 --> 6209.78
feels like this old childish impulses

6205.969 --> 6212.659
that are then just hammered upon and

6209.78 --> 6217.61
emphasized and obsessed over like

6212.659 --> 6220.4
maniacs and in that sense much of the

6217.61 --> 6224.15
symptoms kind of do correlate with the

6220.4 --> 6228.29
classic psycho killer symptoms as well

6224.15 --> 6230.11
except this seems to be much more routed

6228.29 --> 6232.07
into a very persistent

6230.11 --> 6236.36
passive-aggressive attitude so there's

6232.07 --> 6238.46
no likely outburst of crazy killings or

6236.36 --> 6241.42
whatever but for the rest of the

6238.46 --> 6247.55
patterns go yeah they do act like

6241.42 --> 6250.78
psychotics maniacs with the obsession

6247.55 --> 6252.76
with the tenacity with the unrelenting

6250.78 --> 6256.099
nasaw love it

6252.76 --> 6257.51
and apparently that's now everybody's

6256.099 --> 6260.63
getting used to it and that's probably

6257.51 --> 6263.209
even the worst because if back in the

6260.63 --> 6265.909000000001
day 30 40 years ago if people would act

6263.209 --> 6269.449
like this in public they would get

6265.909 --> 6271.579
bloody noses that's just a fact if you

6269.449 --> 6274.369
acted like that kind of [ __ ] that we get

6271.579 --> 6277.159
in chat to people's face you'd get a

6274.369 --> 6280.489
freaking fist in your face it just in a

6277.159 --> 6283.969
few seconds maybe just even one and now

6280.489 --> 6288.86
this [ __ ] is just spouted everywhere

6283.969 --> 6291.849
constantly it's insane by the way thank

6288.86 --> 6294.409
you very very much James mace for the

6291.849 --> 6296.389
$20 super chat donation very much

6294.409 --> 6298.638999999999
appreciated great show or win share the

6296.389 --> 6304.579
show smash the superjet thank you so

6298.639 --> 6309.019
much so enough about me ranting about

6304.579 --> 6312.909
trolls yeah 12 minutes and I think

6309.019 --> 6312.909000000001
Nathan's gonna start up with the debates

6313.69 --> 6320.44
so you guys want to talk about something

6316.88 --> 6320.4400000000005
else or shall we round out the show

6322.959 --> 6328.749
hello chocolate Riley

6331.76 --> 6338.54
yeah I'm here I'm a little busy alright

6334.37 --> 6339.92
I think ride he's probably already ok

6338.54 --> 6341.72
give me a couple of minutes

6339.92 --> 6346.6900000000005
I think Riley was duking it out with

6341.72 --> 6346.6900000000005
these dudes in shot alright wait

6347.739 --> 6366.23
mmm really for a while so uh anyway that

6363.92 --> 6370.03
was my long long-winded analysis of

6366.23 --> 6374.049999999999
trolls and they have a real problem I

6370.03 --> 6377.78
think they probably could get out of it

6374.05 --> 6381.35
but they have the twisted hunger for

6377.78 --> 6383.09
being that depraved so it's just like a

6381.35 --> 6387.35
really bad habit that they just can't

6383.09 --> 6390.650000000001
get rid of it's almost like drinking or

6387.35 --> 6392.93
smoking like really badly except this is

6390.65 --> 6395.839999999999
a psychological effect it is like a very

6392.93 --> 6398.09
weird neurosis but instead of like

6395.84 --> 6401.51
checking if the door is closed like 20

6398.09 --> 6404.110000000001
times every time this is a social

6401.51 --> 6407.2390000000005
related neurosis where they literally

6404.11 --> 6408.71
neurotically are compelled to bully

6407.239 --> 6411.049999999999
people and try to get their attention

6408.71 --> 6413.9890000000005
and try to manipulate them it's

6411.05 --> 6417.29
literally a neurotic social disorder

6413.989 --> 6421.04
basically I think that's pretty spot-on

6417.29 --> 6425.2699999999995
an analysis for trolling neurotic social

6421.04 --> 6428.48
disorder coming back to the same chats

6425.27 --> 6433.76
every day every day every day every day

6428.48 --> 6436.429999999999
four years doing the same [ __ ] now if

6433.76 --> 6438.71
that is a neurotic that's the sad part

6436.43 --> 6443.150000000001
even it is four years some of these

6438.71 --> 6445.4
freaking losers it's so funny it's sad I

6443.15 --> 6447.259999999999
can't even think it's funny anymore it's

6445.4 --> 6450.5599999999995
just being imagine being a troll for

6447.26 --> 6457.900000000001
four years straight imagine everything

6450.56 --> 6457.900000000001
to control every day every day every day

6459.87 --> 6467.2
like how can you even amuse yourselves

6463.87 --> 6468.49
doing that every day for years I just I

6467.2 --> 6473.59
don't get it

6468.49 --> 6477.099999999999
I would be bored after like a month like

6473.59 --> 6479.2300000000005
totally sick bored of it I would be so

6477.1 --> 6482.83
bored of trolling I'd probably just

6479.23 --> 6486.16
start to actually entertain it try to

6482.83 --> 6489.01
act more like the group and try to get

6486.16 --> 6491.11
inside out just to do something new but

6489.01 --> 6493.06
that constant freaking monotonous

6491.11 --> 6496.0
trolling in that constant slander I

6493.06 --> 6498.910000000001
can't believe they could do that I can't

6496.0 --> 6502.39
believe they can actually keep on doing

6498.91 --> 6504.67
that without eventually like dying from

6502.39 --> 6506.26
an aneurysm from that that negative

6504.67 --> 6514.6900000000005
pressure I can't believe they can

6506.26 --> 6516.820000000001
actually survive that so what'd I miss

6514.69 --> 6521.0199999999995
nothing much me complaining about trolls

6516.82 --> 6522.429999999999
and profiling them feel special they

6521.02 --> 6526.360000000001
make me feel good trouble for like the

6522.43 --> 6529.87
trolls yeah you do have this weird troll

6526.36 --> 6531.25
cuddling fetish not cuddling they just

6529.87 --> 6532.78
make me feel good if we didn't have

6531.25 --> 6535.09
trolls trolling us then I would feel

6532.78 --> 6537.61
less in like I would feel less useful to

6535.09 --> 6540.150000000001
society because there's nobody for me to
