14.82 --> 18.8
hello and welcome back

19.02 --> 23.3
let's do the second part of my show

21.9 --> 26.278999999999996
today

23.3 --> 28.859
12 53b

26.279 --> 32.278999999999996
my internet got cut off and had to

28.859 --> 34.02
basically reset everything

32.279 --> 36.78
uh

34.02 --> 40.079
restart my entire computer

36.78 --> 43.2
so yeah

40.079 --> 45.42
sorry about that

43.2 --> 49.64
I hope people find their way to my chat

45.42 --> 49.64
again because it is another chat

56.699 --> 61.879
all right

58.859 --> 61.879000000000005
hello Matthew ho

64.019 --> 68.60000000000001
please tell the others in the other chat

65.939 --> 68.6
if you can

70.5 --> 75.479
I basically I was trying to look up

72.78 --> 77.22
something on IMDb and then like chat for

75.479 --> 79.14
us and everything froze and I thought

77.22 --> 81.17999999999999
like oh what's going on

79.14 --> 84.14
and it was my internet connection was

81.18 --> 84.14
completely cut off

87.84 --> 91.04
okay so you can start water

91.38 --> 95.759
right because I would talk about the

93.659 --> 99.18
movie blueberry

95.759 --> 101.88
and it's also called another name for it

99.18 --> 104.80000000000001
is Renegade it's just like from but it's

101.88 --> 107.89
from 2004

104.8 --> 107.89
[Music]

113.28 --> 116.359
[Music]

130.5 --> 137.64
right so to get very specific here

134.58 --> 139.92000000000002
I'm linking you off because this is not

137.64 --> 141.83999999999997
an easy to find movie

139.92 --> 143.879
it is always be I think it's like

141.84 --> 146.16
obscured

143.879 --> 148.92
on purpose

146.16 --> 152.4
because there's some real deep [ __ ] in

148.92 --> 156.95899999999997
here like spiritual stuff that is that

152.4 --> 159.18
they completely leave open as a mystery

156.959 --> 161.54
there's like very mysterious things in

159.18 --> 161.54000000000002
this movie

161.76 --> 166.26
like when I first saw it I was really

164.34 --> 169.62
fascinated by it which and it wasn't

166.26 --> 169.62
like 2008.

174.48 --> 181.57999999999998
oh and by the way definitely not for

177.3 --> 181.58
kids this gets pretty rough

190.68 --> 195.62
oh the movie's on YouTube are you sure

193.2 --> 195.61999999999998
about that

201.23 --> 204.82999999999998
[Music]

207.599 --> 209.78
foreign

210.48 --> 214.099
I think it might be yeah

214.62 --> 220.37900000000002
I am seeing like two full but I don't

218.58 --> 222.739
know if they're like fully English and

220.379 --> 222.739
all that

224.819 --> 229.61999999999998
yeah it doesn't seem to be particularly

226.739 --> 231.48000000000002
censored on YouTube at least

229.62 --> 233.84
right so you could probably watch it

231.48 --> 233.84
that way

248.4 --> 253.62
yeah I just like YouTube search

250.5 --> 257.88
blueberry 2004.

253.62 --> 263.58
and I got like three full movie

257.88 --> 264.96
videos like one hour 50 minutes to two

263.58 --> 267.3
hours ten

264.96 --> 269.75899999999996
so there is the full movie of that

267.3 --> 271.86
specific sword is on YouTube if you want

269.759 --> 274.62
to find it but I don't know like what

271.86 --> 276.84000000000003
version it is if it's good because I'm

274.62 --> 279.72
pretty sure there's multiple languages

276.84 --> 282.56
versions about it

279.72 --> 282.56
ah

285.72 --> 290.22
streaming sides too okay cool

288.3 --> 292.02000000000004
I know but

290.22 --> 293.58000000000004
I don't know what it is I don't think a

292.02 --> 295.68
lot of people have heard about this

293.58 --> 298.56
movie

295.68 --> 301.32
and so like half the people I showed it

298.56 --> 304.02
to even didn't like it

301.32 --> 306.06
like they didn't like it

304.02 --> 309.139
but it is probably because there's there

306.06 --> 311.759
is some like real light and darkness

309.139 --> 313.32
spiritual stuff in here and it's very

311.759 --> 317.28000000000003
serious

313.32 --> 320.039
and like even their Spirit mechanics

317.28 --> 322.5
in this movie

320.039 --> 325.94
that kind of just

322.5 --> 325.94
they slip it in there

333.61 --> 336.759
[Music]

338.22 --> 345.8
anyway an interesting movie to check out

342.3 --> 345.8
18 years ago

353.88 --> 359.88
so yeah if you want to watch a pretty

357.259 --> 364.139
gritty and trippy

359.88 --> 367.38
uh Western styled

364.139 --> 370.8
yeah sort of Adventure

367.38 --> 374.15999999999997
with Sham adventure with Shamanism type

370.8 --> 375.13
movie in a western setting this is the

374.16 --> 378.19
movie

375.13 --> 378.19
[Music]

380.699 --> 383.699
what

385.86 --> 390.72
what the hell no at least you never

388.62 --> 392.639
heard of that and the way you describe

390.72 --> 395.41900000000004
it I don't think I'd ever want to watch

392.639 --> 395.419
something like that

395.639 --> 399.199
sounds very tiresome

403.93 --> 408.66
[Music]

405.66 --> 408.66
unintended

410.72 --> 417.319
[Music]

414.539 --> 417.31899999999996
uh

434.699 --> 440.72
oh look it's poetry but he's back

446.699 --> 449.539
good morning

450.52 --> 453.69
[Music]

492.36 --> 495.379
right anyway

496.8 --> 499.58
guys

500.699 --> 503.599
I'm here

504.66 --> 508.09900000000005
what do you want me to talk about

509.039 --> 513.0
I mean it's nice to kind of exchange

511.199 --> 516.0
interesting movies that you could watch

513.0 --> 517.8
and all that but come on that there must

516.0 --> 520.82
be more

517.8 --> 520.8199999999999
than just that

540.779 --> 543.779
foreign

543.91 --> 549.1899999999999
[Music]

570.72 --> 577.32
and in a way this is why I allow trolls

575.519 --> 580.14
to hang around

577.32 --> 583.44
because when you guys are all like super

580.14 --> 587.24
mellow and all that I don't really know

583.44 --> 587.24
how to like break through

589.38 --> 593.42
it's just I get kind of mellow

597.06 --> 599.6099999999999
what do I want to talk about I don't

598.98 --> 602.71
know

599.61 --> 602.71
[Music]

606.72 --> 612.9590000000001
I mean talking about movies and all that

609.18 --> 615.5999999999999
it it's fair enough there is something

612.959 --> 618.66
interesting about it I have a lot of

615.6 --> 620.339
deep analysis and all that but

618.66 --> 622.76
come on

620.339 --> 626.0400000000001
like

622.76 --> 630.86
divining movies and all that

626.04 --> 630.86
it's got like that's not all I do here

655.16 --> 660.3
Antarctic treaty meeting in Berlin today

658.14 --> 662.1899999999999
what what are you talking about hello

660.3 --> 665.309
that blood pillow by the way

662.19 --> 665.3090000000001
[Music]

667.33 --> 670.389
[Music]

676.38 --> 679.82
hello just Palmer

691.32 --> 696.899
go look for them oh oh really there's

694.14 --> 698.8199999999999
plenty of unicorns out there seeking

696.899 --> 701.48
star water haven't you heard just go

698.82 --> 701.48
look for them

701.54 --> 708.48
I mean I am quite certain there's a lot

704.88 --> 710.8389999999999
of glow proofs to be rumored to be out

708.48 --> 710.839
there

711.12 --> 718.74
but to actually find one you know

715.92 --> 721.88
and then lay it out that's another

718.74 --> 721.88
matter isn't it

725.73 --> 728.779
[Music]

731.36 --> 735.72
[Music]

733.38 --> 737.519
how many flat Horizons does it take to

735.72 --> 739.94
make a ball

737.519 --> 742.68
or infinite

739.94 --> 745.22
infinite amount of flat Horizons would

742.68 --> 745.2199999999999
make a ball

746.639 --> 753.36
except there's a paradox right there

750.72 --> 757.98
because if it would take infinite then

753.36 --> 760.8000000000001
how could it have a finite size

757.98 --> 763.98
like the boss suggested to have right

760.8 --> 765.779
the problem is the finite size to it if

763.98 --> 767.22
it was just stated like the Earth is

765.779 --> 769.26
just a ball

767.22 --> 770.399
but we don't know its size but it's a

769.26 --> 772.38
ball

770.399 --> 774.66
then

772.38 --> 778.139
yeah it wouldn't be

774.66 --> 780.54
as philosophically easy to defeat

778.139 --> 782.94
because it is this specific geometry

780.54 --> 787.279
that is basically claimed that is so

782.94 --> 787.2790000000001
easily so easy to disprove

792.3 --> 794.8389999999999
uh

794.94 --> 800.94
what's that okay thanks for link Netflix

797.7 --> 803.12
I'll check it out

800.94 --> 803.12
foreign

807.86 --> 816.12
yeah right the Antarctic treaty meeting

812.1 --> 819.019
is in Antarctica right

816.12 --> 819.019
really

830.639 --> 837.36
well yeah just a picture suggestion I

833.82 --> 839.5400000000001
guess it's held in Germany

837.36 --> 839.54
foreign

843.36 --> 846.36
what

854.22 --> 860.4590000000001
one of the most successful of all

857.279 --> 863.459
International agreements

860.459 --> 863.459
wow

879.839 --> 885.6600000000001
like what are they doing there

882.959 --> 887.5189999999999
but there's some knitting club meeting

885.66 --> 889.92
like what the hell are they even gonna

887.519 --> 892.94
talk about

889.92 --> 892.9399999999999
it seems like

893.16 --> 895.76
what

896.24 --> 899.289
[Music]

900.959 --> 907.3199999999999
oh my God look at that look at give me a

905.16 --> 909.36
dirt alert seeking star water there's

907.32 --> 911.22
definitely one there look at what he

909.36 --> 915.36
said

911.22 --> 919.26
the best proof in my opinion is to watch

915.36 --> 920.82
a ship Disappear Completely Over the

919.26 --> 924.959
Horizon

920.82 --> 926.72
and try Zoom it back into view it can't

924.959 --> 930.56
be done

926.72 --> 930.5600000000001
Jesus Christ dude

930.839 --> 933.62
I mean

935.88 --> 940.3389999999999
like I'm getting out of breath

942.24 --> 947.639
that

943.44 --> 949.8000000000001
still somebody is actually saying that

947.639 --> 952.91
at this point after everything like

949.8 --> 952.91
[Music]

953.04 --> 959.88
I mean did you just come up with that

956.04 --> 962.8199999999999
after like coming out of your coma that

959.88 --> 965.04
lasted eight years

962.82 --> 967.62
is that how you came to this genius

965.04 --> 970.3389999999999
conclusion

967.62 --> 970.339
or

970.68 --> 977.579
after 2015 you just were not capable of

975.3 --> 979.74
learning new things anymore

977.579 --> 981.7199999999999
like what's going on here

979.74 --> 984.72
it's not flood

981.72 --> 987.839
what's going on here why would you

984.72 --> 992.1600000000001
forward like the first

987.839 --> 994.62
most elaborately disproven claim ever

992.16 --> 997.68
like that's the foundational claim that

994.62 --> 1002.24
has been utterly disproven with

997.68 --> 1003.7399999999999
absolutely no recourse to ever recover

1002.24 --> 1006.8
what's wrong

1003.74 --> 1010.88
with what I just say

1006.8 --> 1013.0999999999999
try it sometime Jesus Christ

1010.88 --> 1016.16
hey numpty

1013.1 --> 1018.72
at Horizon you think the boat is going

1016.16 --> 1020.54
over is not geometric

1018.72 --> 1023.9590000000001
[Music]

1020.54 --> 1026.36
the boat isn't disappearing bottom up

1023.959 --> 1030.02
because there is something physically

1026.36 --> 1032.539
obstructing it from your view

1030.02 --> 1036.9189999999999
you understand

1032.539 --> 1039.319
this Black Swan observations

1036.919 --> 1043.7800000000002
one foot height

1039.319 --> 1043.78
11 mile distance sight

1043.819 --> 1051.02
if the Earth was a globe with the

1046.76 --> 1053.179
claimed purported geometry such a site

1051.02 --> 1056.24
would be impossible under every

1053.179 --> 1058.46
circumstance every circumstance but it

1056.24 --> 1061.22
isn't because there have been these

1058.46 --> 1064.76
sites on multiple occasions

1061.22 --> 1067.94
modus toilets it cannot be that geometry

1064.76 --> 1072.46
this suggests that boats go over a

1067.94 --> 1072.46
geometry would be to invoke

1072.5 --> 1077.78
the suggestion that the Horizon is a

1075.38 --> 1080.7800000000002
geometric Edge after

1077.78 --> 1082.8799999999999
it goes behind that right well it

1080.78 --> 1086.12
doesn't do that

1082.88 --> 1088.64
because a geometric obstruction cannot

1086.12 --> 1091.6399999999999
be flexible

1088.64 --> 1095.14
and if you are ever able to observe

1091.64 --> 1098.6000000000001
something at 11 miles away at one foot

1095.14 --> 1102.8600000000001
observation height then the geometry

1098.6 --> 1106.7199999999998
claim is completely out of the door

1102.86 --> 1106.7199999999998
that could never be

1107.84 --> 1112.22
yeah

1109.22 --> 1114.8600000000001
so you're fantasizing still about a

1112.22 --> 1116.1200000000001
curve obstructing The View but it

1114.86 --> 1118.28
doesn't

1116.12 --> 1121.1599999999999
because if the curve were obstructing

1118.28 --> 1122.1789999999999
The View then it would always have to do

1121.16 --> 1125.8400000000001
so

1122.179 --> 1128.6000000000001
in exact proportion to the geometry of

1125.84 --> 1132.1999999999998
Presumed to be spherical Earth

1128.6 --> 1137.12
it doesn't if it were then you wouldn't

1132.2 --> 1140.179
be able to see things 11 miles away at

1137.12 --> 1141.62
one foot observation height do you

1140.179 --> 1144.2
understand

1141.62 --> 1146.32
that that makes that assertion

1144.2 --> 1148.3600000000001
impossible

1146.32 --> 1153.559
one foot

1148.36 --> 1156.559
one foot above sea level

1153.559 --> 1156.559
11

1157.299 --> 1163.4
miles

1159.08 --> 1164.6
away you see the beach okay there is no

1163.4 --> 1167.539
chance

1164.6 --> 1171.4599999999998
on a spherical geometry that you could

1167.539 --> 1171.46
see that no chance whatsoever

1192.559 --> 1200.0
right also another technological fact

1197.78 --> 1202.6399999999999
yeah periscopes

1200.0 --> 1204.62
periscopes as things that are used to

1202.64 --> 1206.0
basically

1204.62 --> 1209.4189999999999
look

1206.0 --> 1212.179
top side in submarines

1209.419 --> 1216.3200000000002
yeah they stick out of the water

1212.179 --> 1218.659
one feet one foot one foot slightly more

1216.32 --> 1223.3999999999999
right that's how far it sticks out of

1218.659 --> 1226.22
the water to spot other vessels

1223.4 --> 1229.72
several miles away

1226.22 --> 1232.82
yeah that's technologically

1229.72 --> 1235.88
inherent that's literally the technology

1232.82 --> 1238.82
that is standardized for a submarine

1235.88 --> 1241.5800000000002
poof

1238.82 --> 1244.1
I out of the water

1241.58 --> 1246.08
seeing miles away it works great by the

1244.1 --> 1249.4399999999998
way because it's so small it's only one

1246.08 --> 1252.4399999999998
foot high that something else will not

1249.44 --> 1255.679
be able to see it right if it's just

1252.44 --> 1258.0800000000002
sticking out of what you can't see that

1255.679 --> 1260.38
at like 10 miles distance

1258.08 --> 1265.52
but

1260.38 --> 1268.22
you with the Periscope up can see really

1265.52 --> 1270.2
big things at such a distance like an

1268.22 --> 1272.48
entire ship

1270.2 --> 1274.88
that's just floating there

1272.48 --> 1277.159
right but the Periscope itself is very

1274.88 --> 1281.179
small with a very small angular side so

1277.159 --> 1283.22
it's very hard to Spot It

1281.179 --> 1285.919
very tough

1283.22 --> 1287.539
visually that is right that's why it's

1285.919 --> 1290.6000000000001
so effective

1287.539 --> 1293.419
because the Earth is flat

1290.6 --> 1297.1399999999999
yeah if it wasn't flat then a periscope

1293.419 --> 1299.72
would be completely useless because you

1297.14 --> 1301.8200000000002
wouldn't be able to see anything

1299.72 --> 1303.919
and then you'd have to like open the

1301.82 --> 1305.8999999999999
Periscope more and more oh guess what

1303.919 --> 1308.179
now you're visible all of a sudden

1305.9 --> 1309.5
something's really sticking out

1308.179 --> 1311.48
yeah

1309.5 --> 1314.299
you don't have to do that though because

1311.48 --> 1316.82
the Earth is flat and sticking up your

1314.299 --> 1319.52
Periscope one foot above the sea level

1316.82 --> 1321.6789999999999
is sufficient

1319.52 --> 1322.94
is sufficient to still be able to

1321.679 --> 1326.6000000000001
visually

1322.94 --> 1329.0800000000002
see things at several miles distance

1326.6 --> 1329.08
okay

1329.84 --> 1334.58
that's

1331.58 --> 1334.58
what

1336.62 --> 1341.059
no

1338.9 --> 1343.94
Aaron Armstrong I'm not talking about

1341.059 --> 1346.58
the the literal length of the entire

1343.94 --> 1348.679
device within the submarine I'm talking

1346.58 --> 1351.26
about how much it sticks out of the

1348.679 --> 1358.1000000000001
water when they use it it doesn't stick

1351.26 --> 1360.98
out 37 to 48 feet okay that's ridiculous

1358.1 --> 1363.559
it doesn't stick out like

1360.98 --> 1365.78
a 10 meter Pole

1363.559 --> 1368.62
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

1365.78 --> 1368.62
Aaron Armstrong

1380.8 --> 1383.859
[Music]

1384.86 --> 1390.1999999999998
how far can the Periscope see they can

1387.26 --> 1393.799
be made to see very far right

1390.2 --> 1396.0800000000002
depending on the type of uh mirror and

1393.799 --> 1398.179
lensing they have I think that they

1396.08 --> 1399.9399999999998
might have some kind of wide angle lens

1398.179 --> 1403.8200000000002
situation

1399.94 --> 1406.94
or at least I don't know exactly what

1403.82 --> 1410.24
type right periscopes used to just be

1406.94 --> 1411.3200000000002
mirrors it's just like a telescope with

1410.24 --> 1413.72
mirrors

1411.32 --> 1415.7
just like that now they might have like

1413.72 --> 1418.88
even digital enhancement but the the

1415.7 --> 1422.659
main factor remains is that it only has

1418.88 --> 1425.779
to stake out very little so that it is

1422.659 --> 1429.8200000000002
very hard to visually spot which is kind

1425.779 --> 1429.82
of the point of of a submarine

1444.74 --> 1450.38
right angle yeah I'm I'm not yeah I just

1448.22 --> 1451.88
guessed the wide angle I don't know I

1450.38 --> 1454.159
don't know like if they have like

1451.88 --> 1455.3600000000001
digital enhancement or something that

1454.159 --> 1458.0
they use

1455.36 --> 1462.34
I just know the old-fashioned periscopes

1458.0 --> 1462.34
that were used in the pre-electronic age

1463.039 --> 1469.82
right because there were like submarines

1465.5 --> 1473.36
in a free electronic age now those

1469.82 --> 1475.34
existed and they had periscopes that

1473.36 --> 1478.52
were just mechanical

1475.34 --> 1481.9399999999998
it's just a telescope with mirrors

1478.52 --> 1484.58
that's it that's what it is

1481.94 --> 1486.799
now nowadays there's electronics so they

1484.58 --> 1489.559
might have like

1486.799 --> 1491.6
you enhancers in front of red I don't

1489.559 --> 1494.6589999999999
know what they put in there

1491.6 --> 1496.9399999999998
but the principle Remains the Same it's

1494.659 --> 1500.0
just a viewer that doesn't stick out

1496.94 --> 1504.4
very far and still see very far away

1500.0 --> 1504.4
because the Earth is flat

1505.1 --> 1507.6999999999998
laughs

1511.94 --> 1515.3200000000002
yeah sorry dude

1515.659 --> 1519.0390000000002
I'm not amused

1522.679 --> 1526.0
hey lamel forever

1542.779 --> 1549.88
how far can a periscope see

1546.86 --> 1549.8799999999999
I could look it up

1552.46 --> 1556.46
average distance

1557.659 --> 1562.189
oh

1559.16 --> 1562.189
[Music]

1575.72 --> 1580.94
it doesn't say

1577.88 --> 1584.5390000000002
oh now I get it yeah up to 60 feet long

1580.94 --> 1587.299
right they they're basically pretty long

1584.539 --> 1592.779
devices but they don't typically

1587.299 --> 1592.779
stick out of the water 60 feet again

1599.0 --> 1605.86
right what is the range of a periscope

1602.24 --> 1605.86
a thousand yards

1612.38 --> 1615.7600000000002
how much is a thousand yards

1616.7 --> 1621.159
it doesn't say weird thing

1622.58 --> 1628.039
wait there's almost

1624.679 --> 1631.72
yeah 914 meters

1628.039 --> 1631.72
so that's like a kilometer

1632.96 --> 1635.919
it's pretty damn far

1643.34 --> 1648.08
for something that sticks sticks out of

1645.62 --> 1653.4399999999998
can stick out of the water like

1648.08 --> 1653.4399999999998
one three foot something like that

1664.399 --> 1669.559
four to five feet above water line fair

1667.1 --> 1671.7199999999998
enough yeah well it's look if you're

1669.559 --> 1675.46
gonna stick it out further and you will

1671.72 --> 1675.46
be able to see further right

1675.5 --> 1681.64
but the fact remains is that it still

1677.899 --> 1681.6399999999999
doesn't fit the globe geometry

1683.059 --> 1689.26
throws a globe geometry you would not be

1686.0 --> 1689.26
able to see anything

1689.48 --> 1697.539
at like super low above the wet above

1693.74 --> 1697.539
the water line but they do

1698.72 --> 1704.539
just like people on the beach being able

1701.72 --> 1706.94
to see the other side

1704.539 --> 1709.46
another beach one foot observation

1706.94 --> 1712.279
height 11 miles away now that's kind of

1709.46 --> 1714.26
a lucky moment where it's all very clear

1712.279 --> 1717.02
and the water is easy

1714.26 --> 1719.12
but that still doesn't really matter

1717.02 --> 1722.02
because on the globe it would never be

1719.12 --> 1722.02
possible ever

1723.919 --> 1728.0
there would be geometric obstruction you

1726.44 --> 1730.22
would never be able to see anything

1728.0 --> 1734.0
beyond it

1730.22 --> 1738.159
but we do occasionally Black Swan the

1734.0 --> 1738.159
Earth is flat it's not the globe

1739.66 --> 1743.8290000000002
[Music]

1744.679 --> 1746.8600000000001
foreign

1749.61 --> 1757.369
[Music]

1774.38 --> 1780.38
no I'm not able to stream simultaneously

1777.32 --> 1783.52
low logical conclusion and I don't care

1780.38 --> 1783.5200000000002
for a bigger audience

1792.74 --> 1798.6200000000001
but by all means share the show right

1796.58 --> 1800.96
but let's have it in here I'm not gonna

1798.62 --> 1802.9399999999998
have like multiple platforms and

1800.96 --> 1806.24
multiple chats that I'm going to have to

1802.94 --> 1809.38
like check and compartmentalize I very

1806.24 --> 1809.38
much don't want that

1836.48 --> 1839.02
dude

1871.82 --> 1879.3799999999999
hey hey just a reminder

1874.64 --> 1881.7990000000002
if anybody's going to enter my chat

1879.38 --> 1886.1000000000001
for like the first time speak up

1881.799 --> 1888.1399999999999
specifically to be an accusing whiny

1886.1 --> 1890.7199999999998
complainy pants and not actually

1888.14 --> 1895.159
contribute to the conversation but just

1890.72 --> 1898.58
be a whiny [ __ ] like Mark Stout there I

1895.159 --> 1900.2
will ban you just like this

1898.58 --> 1904.34
yeah

1900.2 --> 1906.919
if your entry sentence is whining and

1904.34 --> 1909.3799999999999
complaining your band

1906.919 --> 1912.44
you understand that

1909.38 --> 1917.5390000000002
you're just bad

1912.44 --> 1920.0
I do not accept Gammas in my chat

1917.539 --> 1922.82
you can complain about what somebody's

1920.0 --> 1925.22
saying if you're in a conversation here

1922.82 --> 1928.519
if you literally speak up for the first

1925.22 --> 1932.299
time specifically to whine and complain

1928.519 --> 1935.44
about somebody your band

1932.299 --> 1935.44
just so you know

1942.34 --> 1946.4099999999999
[Music]

1963.08 --> 1968.3799999999999
Matthew ho does you don't justify to the

1966.2 --> 1968.38
troll

1970.76 --> 1978.7
dude you can say whatever you want even

1974.36 --> 1978.6999999999998
if you're not part English or whatever

1982.039 --> 1988.94
yeah I can freaking shame Americans when

1985.46 --> 1992.24
I feel like it I can shame English

1988.94 --> 1994.88
people when I feel like it I can shame

1992.24 --> 1997.519
all those people for their terrible

1994.88 --> 1998.659
qualities whenever the [ __ ] I feel like

1997.519 --> 2001.72
it

1998.659 --> 2003.159
as long as it's real and it's actually a

2001.72 --> 2006.88
problem

2003.159 --> 2009.279
yeah and then I'll gladly

2006.88 --> 2011.6200000000001
show you the other side of those same

2009.279 --> 2015.399
people that are great

2011.62 --> 2017.82
because I like to be fair and balanced

2015.399 --> 2017.82
yeah

2017.98 --> 2027.039
what I do not like is when people say

2021.48 --> 2028.659
you aren't allowed to shame some things

2027.039 --> 2031.179
some group

2028.659 --> 2035.44
for whatever reason

2031.179 --> 2038.26
I mean don't slander a group with base

2035.44 --> 2041.799
like obviously baseless or egregious

2038.26 --> 2044.019
things that are like logically

2041.799 --> 2045.7
unfounded

2044.019 --> 2048.28
yeah I don't mean that as a political

2045.7 --> 2053.2200000000003
statement has to actually be that and

2048.28 --> 2053.2200000000003
not just some technobabble weasel [ __ ]

2054.46 --> 2060.82
right but yeah if you're gonna make fun

2057.639 --> 2062.679
of some aspect of a certain group of

2060.82 --> 2064.78
people

2062.679 --> 2067.419
there's nothing wrong with that that's

2064.78 --> 2068.3390000000004
actually productive it's confronting it

2067.419 --> 2072.5789999999997
will

2068.339 --> 2076.96
indirectly help those people face

2072.579 --> 2079.8590000000004
the reality of their situation

2076.96 --> 2079.859
in good

2081.82 --> 2086.9190000000003
I'm cranky what the [ __ ] are you

2083.98 --> 2088.839
blabbering about Aaron I'm not cranky

2086.919 --> 2091.679
what the hell is this I think you're

2088.839 --> 2091.679
projecting again

2105.82 --> 2109.1400000000003
hello Davey Z

2111.4 --> 2114.9
Aaron [ __ ] off

2117.28 --> 2122.38
there are no global maps all maps are

2121.359 --> 2125.2
flat

2122.38 --> 2129.1600000000003
their Globe projections but they are

2125.2 --> 2131.7
flat the maps are flat they're not Globe

2129.16 --> 2131.7
Maps

2148.0 --> 2150.18
foreign

2167.04 --> 2172.68
yeah the globe that is unprovable

2176.2 --> 2183.0989999999997
they're all flat Maps based on the false

2179.56 --> 2186.46
claim of the Earth being a globe

2183.099 --> 2189.4
yeah we know and by the way that false

2186.46 --> 2194.8
claim is directly mathematically derived

2189.4 --> 2197.6800000000003
from the apparent celestial sphere

2194.8 --> 2201.579
yeah they took the apparent celestial

2197.68 --> 2204.339
sphere then they directly grid locked it

2201.579 --> 2206.98
with the surface

2204.339 --> 2210.04
yeah the angles that you see it at on

2206.98 --> 2212.5
the earth and then they said that means

2210.04 --> 2216.099
the Earth is a globe and then they made

2212.5 --> 2219.339
the Maps using that the

2216.099 --> 2222.94
what do you call again yeah

2219.339 --> 2227.2599999999998
longitude latitude which is directly

2222.94 --> 2229.96
based on Celestial coordinates Celestial

2227.26 --> 2232.3
coordinates not actual

2229.96 --> 2235.359
physical spherical coordinates it's

2232.3 --> 2238.0
Celestial spherical coordinates which

2235.359 --> 2240.7
are apparent not actual

2238.0 --> 2243.88
because it's all holographic over a flat

2240.7 --> 2246.52
plane so there's a map grid called

2243.88 --> 2249.82
longitude and latitude

2246.52 --> 2255.579
and it is based off a celestial sphere

2249.82 --> 2260.7400000000002
not an actual terrestrial sphere

2255.579 --> 2262.78
yeah that's how the global map system is

2260.74 --> 2266.02
projected

2262.78 --> 2269.7400000000002
longitude latitude it's not actually

2266.02 --> 2273.94
taken from a globe it's suggested to do

2269.74 --> 2278.2799999999997
that but it isn't it's all flat

2273.94 --> 2280.839
black real world with a spherical

2278.28 --> 2283.3
projected based map grid called

2280.839 --> 2284.52
longitude and latitude longitude and

2283.3 --> 2288.6400000000003
latitude

2284.52 --> 2292.42
derived from the celestial apparent

2288.64 --> 2294.94
Sphere not the terrestrial sphere which

2292.42 --> 2298.56
doesn't exist it's flat

2294.94 --> 2298.56
that's how it works

2299.52 --> 2303.06
satellites [ __ ] off

2304.119 --> 2309.94
God endless retardation I'm sick of it

2307.0 --> 2313.42
iron I'm already sick of you again

2309.94 --> 2314.98
like this endless recycled garbage

2313.42 --> 2318.339
reflexes

2314.98 --> 2321.88
can you stop the garbage reflexes the

2318.339 --> 2325.72
endless repeating cycle of dispelled

2321.88 --> 2328.2400000000002
[ __ ] can you stop it can you stop

2325.72 --> 2330.3999999999996
doing that

2328.24 --> 2332.7999999999997
prove my claim

2330.4 --> 2337.359
watch the flattered debates we talk

2332.8 --> 2338.7000000000003
about it non-stop non-stop every [ __ ]

2337.359 --> 2341.44
day

2338.7 --> 2344.98
every [ __ ] day

2341.44 --> 2346.7200000000003
must have been like a thousand times we

2344.98 --> 2350.56
brought this up

2346.72 --> 2352.7799999999997
how the global map projection Works how

2350.56 --> 2356.0789999999997
it came into being where it was taken

2352.78 --> 2359.2000000000003
from the assumptions the layout all of

2356.079 --> 2362.44
it I just explained it to you step by

2359.2 --> 2365.02
step there you go

2362.44 --> 2367.839
that's how it works that's how they

2365.02 --> 2369.7
built it that's how it was designed by

2367.839 --> 2374.5
men

2369.7 --> 2377.14
they took the celestial coordinates a

2374.5 --> 2379.18
derived coordinates right then they took

2377.14 --> 2382.0
a presupposition of the Earth being a

2379.18 --> 2385.0
sphere underneath it then made a map

2382.0 --> 2388.0
coordinate system called longitude and

2385.0 --> 2390.88
latitude based on the assumption that

2388.0 --> 2393.94
the Earth is a sphere and then projected

2390.88 --> 2395.26
that onto the actual terrestrial flat

2393.94 --> 2399.2200000000003
land masses

2395.26 --> 2402.28
to create a global map projection which

2399.22 --> 2403.8999999999996
isn't Global it's just the coordinate

2402.28 --> 2408.099
system for it is global because it's

2403.9 --> 2408.94
based on the celestial sphere not the

2408.099 --> 2411.78
Earth

2408.94 --> 2411.78
as a sphere

2412.42 --> 2415.6800000000003
that's how it's made

2417.099 --> 2424.1800000000003
show the evidence that's how it works

2421.24 --> 2427.4199999999996
how can I show what you want me to

2424.18 --> 2429.52
freaking go through a portal to the time

2427.42 --> 2430.599
where they were physically constructing

2429.52 --> 2432.52
it

2430.599 --> 2436.8
where they were literally like getting

2432.52 --> 2436.8
with compasses and what do you call them

2437.079 --> 2443.319
architect tools and just literally doing

2439.96 --> 2445.78
it you want me to go back in time and

2443.319 --> 2448.48
literally film them doing it for you

2445.78 --> 2450.46
what the hell you want from me man

2448.48 --> 2453.2400000000002
what the hell do you want this is how

2450.46 --> 2453.2400000000002
they designed it

2460.42 --> 2467.2200000000003
didn't explain I did explain it I

2463.3 --> 2467.2200000000003
literally told you step by step

2472.48 --> 2483.06
yeah show the detail oh no no I'm not

2478.9 --> 2483.06
go watch the flatter debates

2484.599 --> 2489.76
there's plenty of visual assistants

2487.06 --> 2491.92
there for somebody that's obviously

2489.76 --> 2494.3190000000004
audibly [ __ ]

2491.92 --> 2496.42
and can't actually think for themselves

2494.319 --> 2499.68
without some freaking picture being

2496.42 --> 2499.6800000000003
dangled in front of them

2518.5 --> 2520.68
foreign

2529.66 --> 2535.0
yeah

2531.52 --> 2536.02
no you're a dumbass I'm not a Cranky

2535.0 --> 2539.02
Pants

2536.02 --> 2541.06
I explained it to you you don't listen

2539.02 --> 2544.66
you didn't take a hint

2541.06 --> 2548.56
you're just like show me a full-blown

2544.66 --> 2551.0789999999997
presentation with Advanced Graphics or I

2548.56 --> 2552.52
can't keep my attention together to

2551.079 --> 2555.88
actually understand what you're talking

2552.52 --> 2557.56
about because I'm a lazy spoiled

2555.88 --> 2561.1800000000003
idiot

2557.56 --> 2561.18
they can't focus

2563.74 --> 2567.4599999999996
what's your problem Aaron Armstrong not

2566.38 --> 2570.4
mine

2567.46 --> 2571.78
everybody else here understands it we

2570.4 --> 2573.76
have actually watched The Flat Earth

2571.78 --> 2576.7000000000003
debates

2573.76 --> 2579.6400000000003
I know what I'm talking about I didn't

2576.7 --> 2582.7599999999998
make this up on the Fly

2579.64 --> 2585.339
I extracted this information from

2582.76 --> 2587.8
sitting through flatter debates like a

2585.339 --> 2590.98
hundred or more hours

2587.8 --> 2593.319
hearing about it and being shown how it

2590.98 --> 2595.9
works through presentations of like

2593.319 --> 2598.42
Brian and tenth man and

2595.9 --> 2600.2200000000003
all these guys

2598.42 --> 2603.46
yeah

2600.22 --> 2605.819
I'm just relaying the message of how it

2603.46 --> 2605.819
works

2618.9 --> 2624.88
okay this time is up here get the [ __ ]

2622.3 --> 2628.0600000000004
out of here Aaron

2624.88 --> 2631.119
it was cute to have you around for two

2628.06 --> 2633.2799999999997
days before you turned into a denialist

2631.119 --> 2637.0
gamma [ __ ] again

2633.28 --> 2641.1600000000003
and now you can [ __ ] off again

2637.0 --> 2641.16
like the previous five times

2645.04 --> 2650.74
remember how you wind and complain to me

2648.64 --> 2653.98
in other people's chats about being

2650.74 --> 2657.4599999999996
unbanned and guess what you did it to

2653.98 --> 2660.94
yourself yeah don't whine and complain

2657.46 --> 2663.339
to me about being banned again

2660.94 --> 2667.3
or I will ban you in the other places

2663.339 --> 2671.74
where you whine to me about it okay

2667.3 --> 2673.8390000000004
learn how to freaking pay attention and

2671.74 --> 2677.0789999999997
stop whining

2673.839 --> 2681.599
stop whining and stop recycling 2015

2677.079 --> 2681.599
arguments Like A demented idiot

2685.48 --> 2689.7
a woodworking gummy bear good see you

2715.599 --> 2720.1600000000003
to Panama ruleth

2718.0 --> 2724.06
I didn't want to ban him but he just

2720.16 --> 2726.819
wouldn't stop it's just gamma cycle

2724.06 --> 2731.64
and like yeah if you don't correct

2726.819 --> 2731.64
yourself like that I will ban you

2733.66 --> 2738.22
I mean now I'm just embarrassed that I

2736.3 --> 2740.8
gave you a freaking chance in the first

2738.22 --> 2742.6189999999997
place again

2740.8 --> 2745.78
just goes to show that I'm not

2742.619 --> 2749.6400000000003
intolerant enough

2745.78 --> 2749.6400000000003
I should know better by now

2764.619 --> 2767.1600000000003
foreign

2770.56 --> 2775.06
I mean was my explanation not clear

2773.26 --> 2779.619
enough guys

2775.06 --> 2782.02
did did I not lay it out like

2779.619 --> 2784.96
comprehensible

2782.02 --> 2788.02
about how it actually works like it's

2784.96 --> 2791.38
like once you hear the explanation it

2788.02 --> 2793.18
should click in your mind like yeah that

2791.38 --> 2796.54
makes perfect sense

2793.18 --> 2799.839
right there's the the latitude longitude

2796.54 --> 2803.92
is a Celestial derived system

2799.839 --> 2805.66
it's not actual like that and besides

2803.92 --> 2808.56
all those projections they're not the

2805.66 --> 2811.54
scale so how does that

2808.56 --> 2814.599
proof it's literally glow when it's not

2811.54 --> 2818.2
the scale it makes no sense it's a

2814.599 --> 2820.0
Celestial Globe projection system for

2818.2 --> 2824.2
dividing the map

2820.0 --> 2825.94
up the grid system longitude latitude is

2824.2 --> 2829.66
derived from the celestials and then

2825.94 --> 2832.119
projected onto the flat landscape

2829.66 --> 2835.2999999999997
and nothing is to scale it's probably

2832.119 --> 2837.46
not even literally lined up

2835.3 --> 2839.1400000000003
the way suggested

2837.46 --> 2843.28
right I don't even think it's a disc

2839.14 --> 2846.04
right which makes it very complicated

2843.28 --> 2848.98
so the projection is Warped

2846.04 --> 2852.04
the globe projection longitude latitude

2848.98 --> 2854.559
system that kind of assumes that what

2852.04 --> 2856.42
it's on top of should be a globe even

2854.559 --> 2859.119
though there's no proof for that

2856.42 --> 2861.64
it's like a sheet of paper you could

2859.119 --> 2864.76
just wrap around things and bit a

2861.64 --> 2866.92
stretch here and there and just map

2864.76 --> 2870.0400000000004
projections none of it the scale none of

2866.92 --> 2871.42
it actually you can warp it around

2870.04 --> 2876.579
because

2871.42 --> 2878.8
the globe projection part is only the

2876.579 --> 2881.26
framework assumption that the original

2878.8 --> 2882.88
design derived from the assumption that

2881.26 --> 2885.5200000000004
it's a sphere

2882.88 --> 2889.44
but it's just the projection for the map

2885.52 --> 2892.54
layout grid that's all it's not actually

2889.44 --> 2893.98
literally derived from some euclidean

2892.54 --> 2896.859
globe

2893.98 --> 2900.78
that's not how it worked at all

2896.859 --> 2900.7799999999997
it's not even how they set it up

2950.26 --> 2954.0
okay there's a doom

2954.04 --> 2959.319
I don't know I know there's containment

2956.44 --> 2962.5
I don't think it's a dome a dome is

2959.319 --> 2964.96
already directly suggestive in a

2962.5 --> 2966.4
geometric fashion as to what the shape

2964.96 --> 2968.559
would be

2966.4 --> 2971.079
I don't think it is that I think that

2968.559 --> 2973.7200000000003
the containment is flat

2971.079 --> 2976.92
I think there's a flat top that's what I

2973.72 --> 2976.9199999999996
suspect the most

2981.29 --> 2984.46
[Music]

2987.46 --> 2993.04
because if it was like in any form

2990.76 --> 2994.9
concave or spherical

2993.04 --> 2997.119
the top that is

2994.9 --> 2999.7000000000003
there would be all kinds of weird

2997.119 --> 3002.099
effects that would like directly start

2999.7 --> 3004.9199999999996
showing that it is

3002.099 --> 3005.819
spherical like through Reflections and

3004.92 --> 3008.52
Light

3005.819 --> 3012.2
play and all that so I just think it's a

3008.52 --> 3012.2
flat top it makes the most sense

3014.76 --> 3020.579
it would also explain why there is no

3017.94 --> 3024.78
evidence whatsoever of any kind of touch

3020.579 --> 3027.6600000000003
down point or this presupposed dough

3024.78 --> 3029.28
everybody said oh just go there and then

3027.66 --> 3031.92
you'll bump into the devil yeah that's

3029.28 --> 3035.52
all super cute except there's absolutely

3031.92 --> 3039.599
no shred of evidence for this whatsoever

3035.52 --> 3044.04
only suggestions only suggestions not

3039.599 --> 3048.0
even a hint of proof not even a a rough

3044.04 --> 3051.9
descript remote description of like

3048.0 --> 3054.359
yeah we realized that at this point the

3051.9 --> 3057.8
physical obstruction disabled us from

3054.359 --> 3060.619
going anywhere like not even that

3057.8 --> 3064.44
nothing nothing

3060.619 --> 3067.6800000000003
no hint of any touchdown point

3064.44 --> 3070.14
which really makes the assertion of a

3067.68 --> 3072.839
dome quite difficult because a dome

3070.14 --> 3076.68
because of its geometry nature

3072.839 --> 3079.5589999999997
would have to have a touchdown point

3076.68 --> 3082.98
so I don't think there is a dome

3079.559 --> 3085.26
I think it's a flat top and I think it's

3082.98 --> 3089.099
really weird there might be one singular

3085.26 --> 3090.3590000000004
touchdown point or a pillar or like like

3089.099 --> 3091.7400000000002
table

3090.359 --> 3095.52
feet

3091.74 --> 3098.4599999999996
right flat top some touchdown points

3095.52 --> 3102.3
maybe even a singular one

3098.46 --> 3104.94
that's like in the corner

3102.3 --> 3106.6800000000003
I don't know it's weird and I'm thinking

3104.94 --> 3108.48
already in a looping realm setup so

3106.68 --> 3110.8799999999997
there might be a singular touchdown

3108.48 --> 3115.92
point or

3110.88 --> 3118.079
it is simply just bare and suspended it

3115.92 --> 3120.599
doesn't have maneuvering room in order

3118.079 --> 3123.059
to fall down or anything and it's just

3120.599 --> 3125.339
there and there's nothing we can do

3123.059 --> 3128.94
about it's like a bearer it's just there

3125.339 --> 3133.4
it's completely immovable it doesn't

3128.94 --> 3138.119
it's not like a architecture

3133.4 --> 3141.119
within another thing it's just the top

3138.119 --> 3144.48
and there is no more room

3141.119 --> 3147.0
and it is like a solid surface or rather

3144.48 --> 3149.94
as if it were a solid surface there's no

3147.0 --> 3153.24
actual physical thing there

3149.94 --> 3155.16
it just prevents gas from moving beyond

3153.24 --> 3158.0989999999997
because there is literally no volume

3155.16 --> 3160.6189999999997
Beyond to move into

3158.099 --> 3162.2400000000002
right that's another possibility but

3160.619 --> 3163.26
whatever it is I don't think that there

3162.24 --> 3166.5589999999997
is a

3163.26 --> 3168.8390000000004
physical architecture thing that is

3166.559 --> 3170.0400000000004
comprised of material that is also part

3168.839 --> 3172.2599999999998
of this realm

3170.04 --> 3176.18
that is

3172.26 --> 3176.1800000000003
the containment barrier

3177.18 --> 3181.3799999999997
I don't think there is like a sub

3178.98 --> 3184.02
architecture within the material realm

3181.38 --> 3185.76
that is comprised of the materials of

3184.02 --> 3188.339
the material Realm

3185.76 --> 3190.8590000000004
I don't think that's logical that that

3188.339 --> 3193.7599999999998
makes no logical sense to me from a

3190.859 --> 3193.7599999999998
designer's perspective

3195.119 --> 3197.1800000000003
um

3199.26 --> 3202.1600000000003
foreign

3206.64 --> 3212.819
oh my God

3208.88 --> 3215.46
the leg [ __ ] off

3212.819 --> 3217.88
I think we got a serious numpty Invasion

3215.46 --> 3217.88
right now

3218.579 --> 3223.7400000000002
I mean seriously we just addressed that

3221.52 --> 3227.7599999999998
you're just gonna repeat the same

3223.74 --> 3230.64
dumbass 2015 remarks like a complete

3227.76 --> 3235.2000000000003
idiot

3230.64 --> 3237.5
I mean you should be embarrassed when

3235.2 --> 3240.4199999999996
you say that you should feel

3237.5 --> 3243.72
mortifyingly embarrassed

3240.42 --> 3245.42
when you say boats going over the

3243.72 --> 3249.0589999999997
horizon

3245.42 --> 3252.54
mortifyingly embarrassing

3249.059 --> 3255.48
it is it is really embarrassing to say

3252.54 --> 3258.359
that especially if you're like older

3255.48 --> 3260.52
than 12. I mean if you're younger I'd be

3258.359 --> 3263.24
like okay you'll figure it out over to

3260.52 --> 3266.099
you're older than 12 you should be

3263.24 --> 3269.0989999999997
mortifyingly embarrassed

3266.099 --> 3272.0
to say that at this point after

3269.099 --> 3272.0
everything that's happened

3301.92 --> 3310.16
well yeah Mark Stout well you didn't get

3305.099 --> 3310.1600000000003
a joke you were being gamma that's why

3311.339 --> 3317.88
and being gamma is punishable by Banning

3314.04 --> 3319.799
and besides you seem to be very easy to

3317.88 --> 3321.54
make a new account

3319.799 --> 3323.88
just

3321.54 --> 3326.0589999999997
to come back that's already suspect to

3323.88 --> 3326.059
me

3327.0 --> 3329.48
right

3334.5 --> 3340.4
I mean you should be able to spot when

3337.14 --> 3340.4
people are making a joke

3342.299 --> 3347.94
it took you 20 minutes to make okay fine

3345.78 --> 3349.7400000000002
the next time don't be a gamma and then

3347.94 --> 3353.0
you don't have to spend another 20

3349.74 --> 3353.0
minutes to make another account

3374.099 --> 3380.2200000000003
there is to be a vacuum in space no but

3377.94 --> 3383.16
there isn't

3380.22 --> 3385.68
nature abhors a vacuole

3383.16 --> 3388.0989999999997
you can't create a vacuum without a

3385.68 --> 3388.0989999999997
container

[Music]

3407.16 --> 3412.02
hey restat feeling 2019 what what do you

3411.18 --> 3414.5589999999997
mean

3412.02 --> 3414.559
hmm

3432.119 --> 3436.98
it's not that will be on fbd later claim

3435.54 --> 3442.38
is Bitcoin

3436.98 --> 3445.44
I I highly doubt it would work anywhere

3442.38 --> 3448.319
I highly doubt it

3445.44 --> 3451.26
all the ass arguments from bullheads

3448.319 --> 3454.92
yeah but to be fair that's not 2019 it's

3451.26 --> 3457.619
just 2015. it's the same crap

3454.92 --> 3461.16
that those dumbasses threw at us and

3457.619 --> 3462.54
trolled us with in 2015. it's the same

3461.16 --> 3465.96
[ __ ]

3462.54 --> 3468.0589999999997
it's like the same Kitty school book

3465.96 --> 3470.7
[ __ ]

3468.059 --> 3473.0400000000004
it's like the old book it's all worn and

3470.7 --> 3476.3999999999996
old and Dusty and stinky

3473.04 --> 3478.799
and they just keep on getting that book

3476.4 --> 3481.5
back and repeating the same [ __ ] over

3478.799 --> 3483.24
and over again like complete deranged

3481.5 --> 3486.359
idiots

3483.24 --> 3488.16
keep doing it same thing over and over

3486.359 --> 3489.839
and that's what they do

3488.16 --> 3493.02
what they've been doing it for a very

3489.839 --> 3495.599
long time is not 2019 it's really 2015

3493.02 --> 3498.839
when they started that's the exact same

3495.599 --> 3502.099
arguments the exact same

3498.839 --> 3502.099
random here all right right

3526.799 --> 3529.46
what

3555.079 --> 3558.799
Matty you're weird

3562.38 --> 3569.059
I'm still not sure if I just should ban

3565.44 --> 3569.059
you you're just weird then

3571.44 --> 3576.839
as long as you don't spam my chat it's

3574.14 --> 3579.2
fine you can say a weird thing every now

3576.839 --> 3579.2
and then

3606.42 --> 3612.92
I had a gold plugins

3610.079 --> 3612.92
uh

3624.96 --> 3633.44
call the moon on a landline

3628.98 --> 3633.44
yeah and such a quick landline too

3666.119 --> 3670.2000000000003
yeah

3668.16 --> 3673.2
yeah I totally agree Russ that I've

3670.2 --> 3675.299
looked at the thing many times right and

3673.2 --> 3680.339
that supposed engine

3675.299 --> 3682.74
it's just a nozzle it's just like oh a

3680.339 --> 3684.48
thing right

3682.74 --> 3686.8799999999997
where's the engine

3684.48 --> 3689.339
because like even the size of that

3686.88 --> 3692.6400000000003
booster would make it like the engine

3689.339 --> 3694.619
would take up the entire capsule

3692.64 --> 3697.5589999999997
like it makes no sense it's like what

3694.619 --> 3699.839
they just have the the valve nozzle like

3697.559 --> 3703.2200000000003
straight on the floor and they just sit

3699.839 --> 3706.92
there that makes absolutely no sense

3703.22 --> 3708.5989999999997
the whole thing was just really

3706.92 --> 3710.64
like

3708.599 --> 3713.88
Legos

3710.64 --> 3715.319
type of design made no sense

3713.88 --> 3719.42
right

3715.319 --> 3719.42
yeah I thought that too is really weird

3720.599 --> 3726.299
and of course like the classic argument

3723.079 --> 3728.4
why wasn't there a giant Crater where

3726.299 --> 3730.859
that thing landed and boosted at the

3728.4 --> 3733.38
last second even though like where it

3730.859 --> 3736.799
land it's just on perfectly nice smooth

3733.38 --> 3740.1800000000003
flat sand and all that like that that

3736.799 --> 3740.18
also on top of it

3741.119 --> 3744.319
it's ridiculous

3748.68 --> 3753.1189999999997
they were shocked in person I bet you

3751.319 --> 3756.359
were

3753.119 --> 3759.7200000000003
I was more mystified personally

3756.359 --> 3761.0989999999997
but by just that that foil stuff it's

3759.72 --> 3763.2
like

3761.099 --> 3765.42
what

3763.2 --> 3768.18
what

3765.42 --> 3771.42
like that's

3768.18 --> 3775.2599999999998
like there's not like even a

3771.42 --> 3777.2000000000003
like a steel plate or and it's like just

3775.26 --> 3778.8590000000004
the foil

3777.2 --> 3780.859
what

3778.859 --> 3780.859
what

3782.94 --> 3787.7400000000002
like that was like the most mind-blowing

3785.339 --> 3789.5389999999998
thing about it to me that really

3787.74 --> 3790.9199999999996
eventually just shredded the whole

3789.539 --> 3794.46
Illusions like

3790.92 --> 3797.88
yeah yeah yeah yeah that really doesn't

3794.46 --> 3800.339
make any sense like the nozzle

3797.88 --> 3802.559
booster is one thing which is kind of

3800.339 --> 3805.02
like you could still imagine that they

3802.559 --> 3810.0
might have like did something and

3805.02 --> 3811.079
whatever that but like the foil is the

3810.0 --> 3814.26
wall

3811.079 --> 3815.46
how that make absolutely no sense

3814.26 --> 3818.1600000000003
whatsoever

3815.46 --> 3821.119
like there is no justifiable excuse for

3818.16 --> 3821.1189999999997
that at all

3821.95 --> 3825.79
[Music]

3826.26 --> 3831.42
I mean they would literally all have

3828.72 --> 3834.7799999999997
frozen to death very quickly

3831.42 --> 3836.099
very very quickly

3834.78 --> 3838.3190000000004
thus

3836.099 --> 3841.98
well those gases are

3838.319 --> 3844.319
just gonna rip through the foil and then

3841.98 --> 3846.44
evacuate and then everybody freezes to

3844.319 --> 3846.44
death

3846.96 --> 3850.859
I mean

3849.359 --> 3853.7
it's just

3850.859 --> 3853.7
ugh

3859.98 --> 3864.48
right like the whole thing would just

3862.2 --> 3866.52
pop like a balloon the foil would just

3864.48 --> 3869.819
pop right just like a helium balloon

3866.52 --> 3871.799
eventually just like the pressure

3869.819 --> 3873.42
just

3871.799 --> 3875.7
yeah that's what would have happened

3873.42 --> 3877.559
it's just like a foil balloon going up

3875.7 --> 3879.66
and it would have just gone

3877.559 --> 3881.76
and it's like yeah now you're sitting

3879.66 --> 3884.64
there in your supposed astronaut suits

3881.76 --> 3887.78
basically to open space the rest of the

3884.64 --> 3887.7799999999997
journey good luck with that

3917.46 --> 3921.299
right so yeah thanks by the way for

3919.5 --> 3923.19
bringing all that up

3921.299 --> 3926.239

I'd love to have some feedback on what

3946.559 --> 3952.2000000000003

3952.2 --> 3954.74

3964.14 --> 3970.6189999999997

3967.98 --> 3973.859
with moral issues it's it's kind of

3970.619 --> 3978.2400000000002
about that too right

3973.859 --> 3981.42
it's all very kind of like psychological

3978.24 --> 3984.0589999999997
there's also gamma it's it's very much a

3981.42 --> 3986.46
