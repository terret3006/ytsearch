101.68 --> 107.92
as you can already tell it's

104.96 --> 107.91999999999999
hot out there

109.04 --> 118.159
it's it's yeah kind of clouded

114.399 --> 120.799
but even yeah with all that shade

118.159 --> 121.36
the sun is so bright and it's moist and

120.799 --> 123.52000000000001
it's just

121.36 --> 129.84
very warm so out there it's really kind

123.52 --> 131.76
of tropical

129.84 --> 134.16
and you lose track of time in this type

131.76 --> 136.319
of weather you just sit

134.16 --> 137.44
and yeah the wind can actually be kind

136.319 --> 139.04
of nice

137.44 --> 140.879
especially if you're just sitting in the

139.04 --> 142.879
shade and i parked my

140.879 --> 145.35999999999999
chair that i normally have on the

142.879 --> 148.879
balcony

145.36 --> 151.68
like on the other side of of the wall

148.879 --> 154.16
behind me that you normally look at

151.68 --> 155.519
because there's a little roof there i

154.16 --> 159.599
parked it over there

155.519 --> 159.59900000000002
and it's in the shade most of the uh

160.64 --> 164.39999999999998
of the afternoon so it's a really nice

163.519 --> 167.36
place to sit

164.4 --> 167.36
maybe take a smoke

169.04 --> 173.12
just did that and yeah it was so

172.0 --> 177.12
relaxing that

173.12 --> 184.31900000000002
time kind of really starts to slip by

177.12 --> 188.08
have a nice breeze in the shade

184.319 --> 190.39999999999998
right anybody out there

188.08 --> 193.04000000000002
yeah you don't see anybody with like

190.4 --> 195.84
long sleeves

193.04 --> 199.84
they're pants or shirts today because it

195.84 --> 199.84
is really hot

200.319 --> 202.79999999999998
anyway

207.599 --> 227.83999999999997
it is thursday

211.68 --> 227.84
the 3rd of june 2021

229.519 --> 234.959
yeah didn't really sleep all that well

231.68 --> 240.159
this night i don't know it was very

234.959 --> 243.519
my jaw was like agitated

240.159 --> 245.67999999999998
i think there might be some like minor

243.519 --> 246.799
migration going on right because this is

245.68 --> 250.239
what i learned

246.799 --> 252.08
that the teeth and how it's all rooted

250.239 --> 253.59900000000002
literally with the nerve endings and all

252.08 --> 255.92000000000002
that

253.599 --> 256.959
it's not entirely stable as you might

255.92 --> 259.759
think

256.959 --> 261.519
and there's a whole complex mechanism of

259.759 --> 264.08000000000004
how it

261.519 --> 266.479
well arranges and rearranges itself

264.08 --> 269.19899999999996
depending on what you do

266.479 --> 270.639
like if you bite down a lot then it's

269.199 --> 274.0
gonna get

270.639 --> 277.6
like really pushed around and

274.0 --> 282.16
it will try to maneuver

277.6 --> 284.24
so that there's less lateral

282.16 --> 285.52000000000004
pressure from the teeth against one

284.24 --> 287.36
another because that

285.52 --> 289.44
delivers a kind of tension that's not

287.36 --> 292.56
really good

289.44 --> 293.6
for the tooth and ensure that if you're

292.56 --> 296.16
going to chew down

293.6 --> 296.88
it's going to be all vertical the

296.16 --> 298.32000000000005
pressure

296.88 --> 300.24
because that's what the teeth are made

298.32 --> 304.08
for and

300.24 --> 307.28000000000003
since i did kind of like i have been

304.08 --> 310.88
a biter down a lot

307.28 --> 313.67999999999995
like yeah my entire teens pretty much

310.88 --> 313.68
in my 20s

318.4 --> 325.039
since i manage my composure and my

322.08 --> 328.71999999999997
jaw much more carefully now it's kind of

325.039 --> 331.59999999999997
recovering from all that i think

328.72 --> 332.0
and yeah the hurting in my jaw it i

331.6 --> 334.8
think

332.0 --> 336.84
it might have to do with like minor

334.8 --> 339.84000000000003
adjustments of the position of the

336.84 --> 339.84
molars

340.24 --> 348.24
because literally now yeah

343.919 --> 348.24
i can't bite down

348.32 --> 353.759
as i'm used to and i got these two

353.039 --> 356.0
molars

353.759 --> 356.96000000000004
and they see like through even when i

356.0 --> 359.039
was younger

356.96 --> 362.88
when they first came through they seemed

359.039 --> 366.08
to be displaced inward somewhat

362.88 --> 366.71999999999997
right it's always been like that and it

366.08 --> 369.68
they do

366.72 --> 370.96000000000004
kind of like my jaw is a little too

369.68 --> 373.759
small

370.96 --> 374.31899999999996
for my teeth in a way and even when i

373.759 --> 377.039
was much

374.319 --> 378.16
younger at some point i was advised by a

377.039 --> 381.52
dentist

378.16 --> 384.08000000000004
to like have certain yeah have these

381.52 --> 385.75899999999996
these ones removed it was very shocking

384.08 --> 388.8
revelation to me and that would

385.759 --> 391.6
would prevent a whole bunch of problems

388.8 --> 392.96000000000004
but it was so scared of it because i was

391.6 --> 396.24
just very scared of

392.96 --> 399.19899999999996
like oral operations and all that

396.24 --> 400.16
and i think that all of them that i have

399.199 --> 403.039
had

400.16 --> 403.36
have always had psychosomatic backlash

403.039 --> 406.24
like

403.36 --> 406.24
into the future

406.8 --> 411.84000000000003
and i think much of my issues are that

409.759 --> 413.68
because i have been to the dances quite

411.84 --> 416.96
a couple of times

413.68 --> 419.44
pretty much up until my 20s

416.96 --> 422.08
and it was always on the candy so it was

419.44 --> 426.4
really urged

422.08 --> 429.19899999999996
i had a lot of teeth filled

426.4 --> 431.919
thankfully not all of them some yeah at

429.199 --> 434.24
some point i just discovered like no

431.919 --> 436.79999999999995
they can go away that was a shocking

434.24 --> 439.28000000000003
revelation if i had known that

436.8 --> 443.44
when i was 12 that would have like

439.28 --> 443.44
totally changed my entire approach

443.52 --> 448.639
then again i was always i was never very

446.0 --> 450.56
good with pain

448.639 --> 453.039
right that's really the most reason that

450.56 --> 455.599
people like urged to go to the dentist

453.039 --> 460.31899999999996
is because of the pain

455.599 --> 463.44
but yeah i've kind of engaged in

460.319 --> 466.40000000000003
the attempt to get used to it

463.44 --> 468.4
instead of letting myself get urged to

466.4 --> 471.19899999999996
go to the dentist because i can't really

468.4 --> 474.63899999999995
pay for it in my situation

471.199 --> 476.72
and because i have the belief

474.639 --> 479.68
also through german new medicine which

476.72 --> 482.16
has a yeah a whole different approach to

479.68 --> 482.16
everything

483.199 --> 492.16
that like it should be doable

487.84 --> 494.31899999999996
because this can't only be humans

492.16 --> 495.36
animals have to be able to survive

494.319 --> 496.96000000000004
through that as well

495.36 --> 499.44
right and they don't have any freaking

496.96 --> 503.28
dentists in nature

499.44 --> 505.52
right unless they'd go so insane that

503.28 --> 506.479
they'd literally just try to rip their

505.52 --> 510.31899999999996
own teeth

506.479 --> 512.159
out but i can't imagine that an animal

510.319 --> 514.88
would actually do that

512.159 --> 516.7189999999999
yeah in a situation of pain like they

514.88 --> 521.8389999999999
wouldn't be able to focus

516.719 --> 521.839
right so it has to be survivable

525.12 --> 528.48
get them out no

533.36 --> 538.24
oh okay lamel forever

539.44 --> 542.72
if you say so well i really appreciate

542.399 --> 545.92
them

542.72 --> 549.839
actually i do use them but it's it's not

545.92 --> 549.8389999999999
entirely without problems

555.279 --> 559.92
all right anyway when i bite down now it

557.6 --> 562.0
doesn't really fit as it used to

559.92 --> 563.04
now this might change because as soon as

562.0 --> 565.2
like the pain

563.04 --> 566.3199999999999
goes away and i have a kind of a theory

565.2 --> 570.08
in my head of how

566.32 --> 572.32
what it is actually doing i think what

570.08 --> 573.519
really the bizarre process is is that

572.32 --> 576.48
the nerve

573.519 --> 579.44
like the ner the tooth could technically

576.48 --> 582.5600000000001
be pretty easily transported

579.44 --> 585.0400000000001
right when it gets loose and a little

582.56 --> 586.3199999999999
it can kind of migrate even towards

585.04 --> 589.519
another place

586.32 --> 590.399
but the nerve can't do that so it has to

589.519 --> 593.279
somehow

590.399 --> 595.279
bend and wriggle in a position that it

593.279 --> 598.8
can still handle

595.279 --> 601.04
pressures from later on like resettling

598.8 --> 602.7199999999999
it's and i think that that is kind of

601.04 --> 605.4399999999999
what's happening over here

602.72 --> 606.72
it has happened like on the other side

605.44 --> 611.36
but that

606.72 --> 611.6800000000001
like the arrangement over here seems to

611.36 --> 614.88
be

611.68 --> 617.1999999999999
now very solid like

614.88 --> 620.64
really really reliable and it hasn't

617.2 --> 620.6400000000001
been like that for years

622.959 --> 626.88
anyway hey nathan oakley 1980 good to

626.0 --> 630.16
see you

626.88 --> 630.16
dean wright also

630.839 --> 636.72
uh

633.44 --> 639.0400000000001
yeah nathan hope like the operations all

636.72 --> 639.0400000000001
went

639.36 --> 642.16
without any

644.839 --> 647.839
complications

652.16 --> 658.48
right dentistry

655.2 --> 660.0790000000001
it's a fascinating thing i had a lot of

658.48 --> 662.32
fun with my ex

660.079 --> 666.3199999999999
that too because she was naturally

662.32 --> 666.32
interested she is a professional dentist

666.72 --> 670.9590000000001
and she had gave me a lot of input

672.839 --> 679.519
right

674.8 --> 679.519
yeah good times anyway

683.2 --> 686.24
you got war

687.68 --> 690.4799999999999
what does that mean

699.04 --> 705.36
you got worse

702.72 --> 705.36
oh [ __ ]

707.839 --> 717.839
a lot of painkillers oh

722.639 --> 727.519
yay all right i hope you could take it

728.56 --> 733.1199999999999
like with me there's been a little bit

730.72 --> 733.519
of a regression this night as well like

733.12 --> 737.04
i

733.519 --> 739.04
this night was not pleasant sleeping and

737.04 --> 740.24
the weird thing is like the the pain

739.04 --> 742.639
migrated this

740.24 --> 744.72
typically happens so where before it was

742.639 --> 747.76
really like

744.72 --> 751.12
at the tooth the tooth is not

747.76 --> 755.2
pressure sensitive like it was

751.12 --> 758.32
up until yesterday but it yeah now it's

755.2 --> 761.0400000000001
radiating so it's like my jaw

758.32 --> 762.32
muscle is affected and sometimes it

761.04 --> 765.519
latches out forward

762.32 --> 766.0790000000001
to my chin even it's really weird this

765.519 --> 768.8
is all

766.079 --> 768.8
normal though

769.12 --> 773.839
so yeah i don't run to the dentist

776.399 --> 782.56
right so yeah nathan from my practical

780.079 --> 782.56
experience

782.8 --> 788.8
if it's changing

785.839 --> 789.839
good if it's this exact same thing that

788.8 --> 793.5999999999999
keeps

789.839 --> 797.9200000000001
coming back or even more intensive

793.6 --> 797.9200000000001
like it's really the tooth yeah then

798.16 --> 801.68
then i'd probably go to the dentist as

800.24 --> 803.76
well otherwise

801.68 --> 806.8
it's probably just your jaw trying to

803.76 --> 806.8
rearrange itself

806.88 --> 815.8389999999999
which is very painful by the way

823.12 --> 827.44
it's the anti-bait do you talk

825.399 --> 831.6
antibiotics

827.44 --> 831.6
the [ __ ] okay

837.76 --> 843.8389999999999
all right

844.639 --> 849.519
yeah i got some grapefruit juice by the

847.279 --> 849.519
way

854.839 --> 857.839
huh

870.56 --> 873.5999999999999
all right all right

876.56 --> 885.1199999999999
yeah oh yeah if it's like that

880.32 --> 886.88
yeah you could take antibiotics

885.12 --> 889.04
i personally wouldn't be too over

886.88 --> 889.36
enthusiastic using it it's also just

889.04 --> 891.8389999999999
like

889.36 --> 894.8000000000001
realize what antibiotics is like

891.839 --> 894.8000000000001
antibiotics

895.92 --> 901.12
it's not helping your system to recover

899.279 --> 902.399
from it right this is like how it's

901.12 --> 905.839
supposed to work

902.399 --> 909.04
it doesn't actually help your system

905.839 --> 911.9200000000001
to resolve the problem no it makes it

909.04 --> 914.56
worse on a different front and then like

911.92 --> 917.4399999999999
effectively triggers your body to go

914.56 --> 917.4399999999999
into a more

917.839 --> 926.639
resolving mode so it will typically then

923.839 --> 927.36
like enhance whatever the process that's

926.639 --> 929.36
going on

927.36 --> 930.48
right because if you're in pain and the

929.36 --> 934.0790000000001
inflammation

930.48 --> 935.519
that means literally that your body is

934.079 --> 937.8389999999999
successfully

935.519 --> 939.12
fighting it right that's what causes the

937.839 --> 941.839
like if there was no

939.12 --> 943.12
pain no inflammation that means that

941.839 --> 947.12
your body can't

943.12 --> 947.12
fight whatever is present over there

949.12 --> 954.9590000000001
i would have gone for like colloidal

952.839 --> 958.24
silver

954.959 --> 960.3199999999999
also because you can literally just

958.24 --> 962.8
keep it in your mouth let it be absorbed

960.32 --> 962.8000000000001
locally

965.519 --> 971.759
and it doesn't like push your body to

968.959 --> 972.16
to trigger your immune system like that

971.759 --> 975.36
like

972.16 --> 975.36
antibiotics does

976.48 --> 983.839
anyway cheers

985.199 --> 997.8389999999999
oh it's still really cold nice

1008.839 --> 1011.839
oh

1012.56 --> 1014.8
oh

1017.759 --> 1025.839
no tiny wumble

1036.839 --> 1039.839
so

1045.839 --> 1053.84
yeah hello what antibiotics kill

1049.28 --> 1053.84
bacteria that caused the infection well

1055.2 --> 1064.64
like originally it may do that

1060.799 --> 1064.6399999999999
what i have learned that it is

1064.84 --> 1069.039
specifically

1066.72 --> 1071.52
triggering your immune system to go

1069.039 --> 1071.52
active

1071.679 --> 1074.96
like it's a kickstarter for your immune

1073.76 --> 1080.08
system if it

1074.96 --> 1083.44
wasn't already full in right

1080.08 --> 1084.6399999999999
so it's basically pushing towards the

1083.44 --> 1086.72
healing point

1084.64 --> 1088.7990000000002
because that's what comes right after

1086.72 --> 1090.96
the inflammation the inflammation is a

1088.799 --> 1096.799
sign that your body

1090.96 --> 1096.799
is successfully fighting the infection

1103.039 --> 1111.76
all right anyway

1109.28 --> 1111.76
what the

1116.64 --> 1122.16
uh kamikaze gilmore i hope you mean out

1120.0 --> 1137.84
of your eye socket the soft tissue

1122.16 --> 1137.8400000000001
not literally your eye itself

1146.0 --> 1153.28
okay nathan

1150.0 --> 1153.679
right well yeah in a way that's good at

1153.28 --> 1157.52
fight

1153.679 --> 1160.799
well i wouldn't go for that extremity

1157.52 --> 1164.6399999999999
but the thing is even when i'm sleeping

1160.799 --> 1166.799
in the last week

1164.64 --> 1169.039
if you go perfectly horizontal

1166.799 --> 1172.6399999999999
especially when it's kind of warm

1169.039 --> 1176.32
then your blood really

1172.64 --> 1177.76
gets into your head and all of the veins

1176.32 --> 1181.2
and everything and it kind of

1177.76 --> 1183.52
you have more pressure locally there

1181.2 --> 1186.48
because of it than you do normally when

1183.52 --> 1186.48
you stand upright

1187.28 --> 1192.8799999999999
and so yeah if it's inflamed and it's

1190.24 --> 1195.52
already kind of pushing

1192.88 --> 1195.919
against yeah against something that

1195.52 --> 1198.6399999999999
might

1195.919 --> 1200.4
eventually push against the nerve then

1198.64 --> 1202.88
if you go horizontally

1200.4 --> 1204.799
it the blood will just give another

1202.88 --> 1207.8400000000001
extra push and that can get

1204.799 --> 1207.84
kind of painful

1214.08 --> 1219.12
right one way for me to basically fix

1216.72 --> 1222.0
that is by kind of like getting an extra

1219.12 --> 1224.32
pillow so that your head

1222.0 --> 1227.919
if you can sleep like that if you don't

1224.32 --> 1227.9189999999999
get neck problems because of it

1228.32 --> 1233.4399999999998
you can keep your head a little bit

1230.159 --> 1235.8400000000001
above body level

1233.44 --> 1235.8400000000001
anyway

1245.12 --> 1252.7199999999998
share your pain naga

1248.64 --> 1252.72
my eyeball oh my god dude

1253.76 --> 1263.84
i hope there's no serious damage

1288.84 --> 1291.84
uh

1301.76 --> 1305.84
oh nice dude

1316.84 --> 1319.84
lucky

1330.84 --> 1336.24
hmm

1333.039 --> 1339.52
right well

1336.24 --> 1343.28
i i try to take good care of my teeth

1339.52 --> 1343.28
have for like a decade at least

1344.08 --> 1347.1999999999998
always been very careful not to break

1346.159 --> 1350.3200000000002
any

1347.2 --> 1350.72
not to like to bite down on things that

1350.32 --> 1353.52
are

1350.72 --> 1354.32
too hard i had a couple of risk moments

1353.52 --> 1357.76
like that

1354.32 --> 1360.799
when i was younger because of it i have

1357.76 --> 1364.0
like a minor gifting

1360.799 --> 1367.52
never forget that moment it's like okay

1364.0 --> 1369.2
after that like yeah don't [ __ ] around

1367.52 --> 1372.8799999999999
anymore

1369.2 --> 1378.0800000000002
i'm really glad it hasn't gone any worse

1372.88 --> 1378.0800000000002
uh that's also

1378.32 --> 1382.1589999999999
25 years ago or something

1391.12 --> 1395.6789999999999
uh okay terry 306

1397.28 --> 1406.32
you attack them

1402.559 --> 1409.36
no i wouldn't say it like that

1406.32 --> 1412.799
but yeah you can look it up on the

1409.36 --> 1415.52
german new medicine chart

1412.799 --> 1417.84
every typical location it's very

1415.52 --> 1420.72
specific

1417.84 --> 1420.72
has like

1421.679 --> 1428.159
a social social psychological

1425.039 --> 1428.1589999999999
map correlation

1428.24 --> 1431.679
it's pretty astounding it's it's almost

1430.08 --> 1436.6399999999999
like astrology

1431.679 --> 1436.64
it's astrology for for bodily pains

1440.72 --> 1445.84
okay just joking oh funny

1484.84 --> 1487.84
hmm

1488.64 --> 1493.679
not a tiny wombo better watch out for

1492.159 --> 1496.3200000000002
your tooth fairy

1493.679 --> 1497.3600000000001
the tooth demons and not the tooth oh

1496.32 --> 1499.6789999999999
they got a

1497.36 --> 1502.8799999999999
they got a scam going on so first the

1499.679 --> 1502.88
tooth demon comes

1503.12 --> 1508.32
and starts making you know painful and

1506.0 --> 1508.32
[ __ ]

1508.559 --> 1512.799
and then afterwards the tooth fairy

1512.84 --> 1515.84
comes

1521.039 --> 1529.84
so so they got this controlled

1522.72 --> 1529.84
opposition thing going on

1538.48 --> 1545.039
dental fluorosis causes the over

1541.76 --> 1549.12
whitening not i wouldn't say that

1545.039 --> 1549.12
georgetown for dental fluorosis

1549.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
that's like that's not normal teeth

1553.12 --> 1557.84
like that's like a malformation

1561.76 --> 1565.679
that's not the type of whitening

1566.24 --> 1571.84
that tooth whitening would imply

1597.52 --> 1601.44
yeah i agree nathan probably

1601.6 --> 1607.36
sexted two jesus okay that is a little

1604.799 --> 1607.36
overkill

1608.88 --> 1613.8400000000001
all right

1624.4 --> 1628.799
hey neil how you doing

1633.52 --> 1639.039
today is the dentist show

1636.99 --> 1643.279
[Laughter]

1639.039 --> 1645.44
yeah it's hot over here neal very hot

1643.279 --> 1648.32
but also it's moist that's the really

1645.44 --> 1648.3200000000002
the big difference

1652.399 --> 1658.1589999999999
it's 26 degrees celsius

1655.6 --> 1658.1589999999999
over here

1659.2 --> 1669.8400000000001
and yeah humidity 61

1662.88 --> 1669.8400000000001
yeah that uh

1670.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
that sounds about right

1690.559 --> 1697.12
kids get up and then i start

1693.84 --> 1700.08
editing right well now nathan you have

1697.12 --> 1700.08
done a lot of work

1700.32 --> 1706.48
and i i have personally picked up on it

1704.32 --> 1708.08
the problem is sometimes it makes me

1706.48 --> 1710.0
feel a little ashamed because i just

1708.08 --> 1713.9189999999999
know how much effort you put in all

1710.0 --> 1717.44
that when i do i don't really do it

1713.919 --> 1720.0800000000002
like that i really try to stick things

1717.44 --> 1723.6000000000001
to improvisation

1720.08 --> 1724.0
and persistence so i'm focusing on all

1723.6 --> 1727.1999999999998
different

1724.0 --> 1730.0
things but like

1727.2 --> 1730.0
even the way

1731.12 --> 1735.84
every video every premiere you you now

1734.64 --> 1740.0
put together like

1735.84 --> 1744.399
the little snippets that's a lot of work

1740.0 --> 1745.679
like some people might not really see it

1744.399 --> 1747.6
but that's basically

1745.679 --> 1749.039
you again going through the whole

1747.6 --> 1752.6399999999999
footage and

1749.039 --> 1755.36
editing down like an editor

1752.64 --> 1757.919
and you do that with like almost every

1755.36 --> 1757.9189999999999
premiere

1760.559 --> 1765.2
so yeah you you take a lot you spend

1763.039 --> 1769.6
time

1765.2 --> 1773.1200000000001
making it really tidy and to the point

1769.6 --> 1774.6399999999999
and fun and yeah i appreciate that

1773.12 --> 1776.8799999999999
and i think a whole bunch of people do

1774.64 --> 1776.88
that

1779.6 --> 1782.6399999999999
but you gotta take care of yourself as

1781.919 --> 1795.8400000000001
well

1782.64 --> 1795.8400000000001
hey and your family of course

1809.279 --> 1815.039
right hey how about me i don't even

1811.6 --> 1815.039
freaking take any breaks

1816.08 --> 1822.32
and then i get really sick and then i

1818.159 --> 1824.5590000000002
have to take breaks

1822.32 --> 1824.559
uh

1830.159 --> 1834.3990000000001
i pasted about right yes well i've just

1833.679 --> 1837.6000000000001
got this

1834.399 --> 1841.76
time in the day it's like that's

1837.6 --> 1841.76
work moment of day

1842.24 --> 1848.96
and then i i stopped doing it and then

1846.24 --> 1850.559
like much later in the night i'm really

1848.96 --> 1852.3990000000001
kind of like

1850.559 --> 1854.48
don't overdo it in your mind but i'm

1852.399 --> 1857.9189999999999
kind of like a jellyfish

1854.48 --> 1860.96
just like yay watching

1857.919 --> 1861.6000000000001
like i even see fractal implications but

1860.96 --> 1865.3600000000001
i just

1861.6 --> 1867.9189999999999
don't want to deal with it right then

1865.36 --> 1870.08
and i just trust like okay i see this

1867.919 --> 1871.679
it's going to be recorded even though i

1870.08 --> 1873.6789999999999
might be a little hazy with my

1871.679 --> 1875.8400000000001
consciousness

1873.679 --> 1878.72
and then later on it's gonna fall into

1875.84 --> 1881.9189999999999
place with the rest that i collected

1878.72 --> 1884.0
subconsciously but can't

1881.919 --> 1886.0
yeah in the in the conscious moment like

1884.0 --> 1889.36
very late in the evening

1886.0 --> 1892.0
i am not on form at all

1889.36 --> 1892.6399999999999
i won't be good at social interactions i

1892.0 --> 1895.6
won't be

1892.64 --> 1898.5590000000002
smart i won't be pointing out incredible

1895.6 --> 1901.1999999999998
things that's very unlikely

1898.559 --> 1901.2
in the nights

1903.279 --> 1910.48
i reserve that ability

1906.48 --> 1910.48
for the my working time slot

1914.919 --> 1918.3200000000002
256 weeks

1918.84 --> 1921.84
god

1933.84 --> 1940.8799999999999
well i wonder how much the

1937.6 --> 1942.8799999999999
hours of a live show total

1940.88 --> 1944.3200000000002
so not the premieres because yeah of

1942.88 --> 1946.96
course nathan is all

1944.32 --> 1950.399
totally pumped up with premieres but

1946.96 --> 1952.88
total life recording

1950.399 --> 1954.4799999999998
that will be interesting to compare

1952.88 --> 1957.519
because every video is

1954.48 --> 1962.08
all live i i don't upload videos i

1957.519 --> 1965.1200000000001
very rarely do it

1962.08 --> 1966.399
even though i did want to basically help

1965.12 --> 1969.84
out nathan

1966.399 --> 1972.9599999999998
by uploading that video with the

1969.84 --> 1976.24
uh british parliament guy talking about

1972.96 --> 1978.559
how all the world's stage you know

1976.24 --> 1981.44
there's even bigger stage it is like an

1978.559 --> 1981.44
epic little clip

1983.84 --> 1988.799
but yeah i i just don't do that with my

1986.64 --> 1990.48
channel

1988.799 --> 1992.8799999999999
i almost feel like maybe i should have

1990.48 --> 1997.679
another channel where i do do that

1992.88 --> 2001.3600000000001
because i don't want to put my channel

1997.679 --> 2001.3600000000001
i just want to have live streams

2002.84 --> 2005.84
right

2008.24 --> 2012.3990000000001
a great impersonation yeah but he's so

2010.24 --> 2015.519
great to impersonate he's such a

2012.399 --> 2032.2399999999998
classic british type it's

2015.519 --> 2034.32
brilliant it's like the old written

2032.24 --> 2035.679
editing is way more work well i can

2034.32 --> 2037.84
atone to that

2035.679 --> 2039.6000000000001
for the amount of editing that i have

2037.84 --> 2041.6
attempted

2039.6 --> 2042.9599999999998
god i don't even want to remind people

2041.6 --> 2046.24
about it but

2042.96 --> 2050.2400000000002
when i made that silly flat cat video

2046.24 --> 2052.879
all those years ago i spent like

2050.24 --> 2054.72
hours and hours on that stupid

2052.879 --> 2058.839
three-minute video

2054.72 --> 2062.3199999999997
this is it's just like

2058.839 --> 2063.839
yeah but it was so much work to do that

2062.32 --> 2067.28
and it was pretty cool to have it

2063.839 --> 2067.2799999999997
together eventually but

2069.44 --> 2075.44
you gotta have like a a real

2072.72 --> 2078.0
good professional editing station where

2075.44 --> 2080.32
you just got the right programs you got

2078.0 --> 2082.72
the right setup so that things go quick

2080.32 --> 2085.679
quick quick quick

2082.72 --> 2086.9599999999996
rendering goes quick uploading goes

2085.679 --> 2090.96
quick

2086.96 --> 2093.44
like the memory is all optimized for

2090.96 --> 2094.48
pumping in video material going through

2093.44 --> 2097.28
it quickly

2094.48 --> 2098.96
pumping it out right that's really you

2097.28 --> 2099.8390000000004
got to have a specialized computer for

2098.96 --> 2102.0
that and then

2099.839 --> 2103.92
it it doesn't rob you off your time as

2102.0 --> 2117.839
much

2103.92 --> 2117.839
have that on the ipad okay cool

2121.599 --> 2125.04
right if i'd have a really quick editing

2124.32 --> 2128.96
station

2125.04 --> 2133.04
and now i mean like bc desktop

2128.96 --> 2138.48
heavy level editing or let's say

2133.04 --> 2138.48
what 10 years ago specialized

2140.24 --> 2146.8799999999997
apple computer for that they were i

2143.839 --> 2149.04
think they still are very good at it

2146.88 --> 2151.599
they were really good for that quick

2149.04 --> 2151.599
editing

2153.28 --> 2160.2400000000002
then i'd probably do a lot more of that

2158.079 --> 2161.92
but yeah on my computer i don't have to

2160.24 --> 2164.16
write programs

2161.92 --> 2166.079
and if i do it's going to cost me money

2164.16 --> 2167.92
and [ __ ] and then i'm going to be stuck

2166.079 --> 2170.96
to

2167.92 --> 2170.96
to that format

2171.839 --> 2175.52
20 minutes in three or four hours yeah

2174.4 --> 2178.079
yeah

2175.52 --> 2178.079
i agree

2185.52 --> 2194.72
but if you got your

2190.24 --> 2197.359
uh material libraries very well ordered

2194.72 --> 2199.1189999999997
like very well organized the filing

2197.359 --> 2200.0789999999997
system if you got it all perfectly

2199.119 --> 2204.4
organized for

2200.079 --> 2208.1600000000003
it and you got a really optimal

2204.4 --> 2212.7200000000003
computer for quick again heavy memory

2208.16 --> 2215.839
pumping heavy video material

2212.72 --> 2218.24
then that 20-minute video could

2215.839 --> 2222.56
with that sort of setup be done in 30

2218.24 --> 2222.56
minutes instead of three to four hours

2222.88 --> 2229.839
right but such a setup doesn't come for

2226.839 --> 2229.839
free

2236.4 --> 2243.76
and you gotta have organization

2240.64 --> 2245.839
in your computer in how you do it

2243.76 --> 2249.28
you're really well organized in your

2245.839 --> 2249.2799999999997
filing systems and everything

2249.839 --> 2257.839
keep it tidy

2285.92 --> 2299.839
3d video editing what

2301.28 --> 2313.8390000000004
right yeah slideshows are much easier

2305.359 --> 2313.839
that's right

2322.32 --> 2327.839
yeah you got a good point there nathan

2324.0 --> 2327.839
yeah yeah

2352.839 --> 2355.839
okay

2366.839 --> 2369.839
so

2380.32 --> 2387.04
oh that's hilarious tara 3006

2384.0 --> 2387.04
because it's true

2393.52 --> 2411.839
he gives so much comedy material you

2395.52 --> 2411.839
gotta choose what not to pick yep

2422.839 --> 2425.839
hmm

2442.4 --> 2445.44
yes pat fee

2445.839 --> 2453.2
yeah at the end of the day the earth

2447.52 --> 2467.839
really is flat that's right

2453.2 --> 2467.839
hey seeking star water

2492.839 --> 2495.839
hmm

2504.4 --> 2509.839
spend more time on effie

2525.119 --> 2529.2000000000003
well i do watch a couple of videos but

2527.44 --> 2536.64
not all of them like especially the

2529.2 --> 2541.52
really big ones

2536.64 --> 2544.96
i didn't watch david weiss's interview

2541.52 --> 2549.2
flat earth dave is apparently his new

2544.96 --> 2553.119
handle name anybody see that

2549.2 --> 2553.1189999999997
was uploaded 10 hours ago

2555.359 --> 2564.88
he did a show with awaken atlanta

2558.64 --> 2567.839
that was pretty interesting

2564.88 --> 2570.4
all right also watch owen benjamin at

2567.839 --> 2572.48
bitchute

2570.4 --> 2574.7200000000003
he has some long streams too but yeah

2572.48 --> 2579.839
they're very interesting

2574.72 --> 2579.839
always worth every minute

2603.44 --> 2621.839
hey tony whitcomb

2606.56 --> 2621.839
good to see you

2628.96 --> 2632.48
but yeah did anybody pick up on that

2631.76 --> 2636.88
like i said

2632.48 --> 2636.88
does anybody use david weiss's uh

2637.2 --> 2646.0
what is it his app

2642.4 --> 2649.2000000000003
his sky clock app flat earth app

2646.0 --> 2652.64
because on that show he said that

2649.2 --> 2653.839
apparently somebody over at the flat

2652.64 --> 2657.2
earth society is

2653.839 --> 2659.52
actually copied his app and then messed

2657.2 --> 2659.52
it up

2660.56 --> 2664.0789999999997
like i can't imagine that he would

2663.2 --> 2666.319
actually make

2664.079 --> 2669.44
up something like that so that that is

2666.319 --> 2669.44
like dude

2669.599 --> 2673.3590000000004
talk about control opposition

2674.8 --> 2678.319
did anybody pick up on that

2685.359 --> 2690.96
got the week off i'm binge watching and

2688.4 --> 2693.359
binge eating after they are winter yeah

2690.96 --> 2699.04
yesterday was really a lot about food

2693.359 --> 2699.04
i know a couple of days before that too

2701.119 --> 2709.28
maybe he's a chill

2704.4 --> 2709.28
how how to who

2709.52 --> 2717.44
nathan right

2712.72 --> 2721.4399999999996
when you say chill vincent gets paid

2717.44 --> 2724.2400000000002
to basically advertise for somebody

2721.44 --> 2733.839
without telling that he is so who would

2724.24 --> 2733.839
that be

2737.93 --> 2740.989
[Music]

2749.68 --> 2760.64
oh god dude pat fee

2752.96 --> 2762.64
oh god uh

2760.64 --> 2764.64
yeah nathan did you pick up that was

2762.64 --> 2769.1189999999997
like

2764.64 --> 2774.4
three days ago now i sent

2769.119 --> 2777.359
that moment to to john

2774.4 --> 2777.359
let me check it out

2777.68 --> 2788.8799999999997
all right it's the joe rogan is a

2779.599 --> 2792.079
hairless panda episode

2788.88 --> 2795.599
and at exactly yeah if you go to one

2792.079 --> 2798.079
hour 11 minutes and 11 seconds

2795.599 --> 2799.2000000000003
that's when like the whole thing

2798.079 --> 2803.92
unrolled

2799.2 --> 2803.9199999999996
was the 31st of may that show

2804.56 --> 2808.48
that's when that that how do y'all i'm

2807.68 --> 2811.5989999999997
billy and

2808.48 --> 2816.16
somebody else came in

2811.599 --> 2820.079
with the whole nonsense about how

2816.16 --> 2820.0789999999997
tidal locking of the moon

2820.88 --> 2828.2400000000002
has nothing to do with the tides

2825.599 --> 2830.0
right and then after i don't know if it

2828.24 --> 2832.8799999999997
was the same day or the day after

2830.0 --> 2835.28
but that also came up on on your live

2832.88 --> 2835.28
stream

2836.88 --> 2839.839
you got to watch that

2840.72 --> 2846.3999999999996
i'll link you up directly in chat if you

2843.52 --> 2846.4
want to check it out

2847.839 --> 2859.839
with the timestamp

2860.72 --> 2864.64
can i explain this explain the tides on

2862.88 --> 2868.4
flat earth okay

2864.64 --> 2871.2
neil i know you're echoing

2868.4 --> 2872.1600000000003
what the ballers say the silly thing is

2871.2 --> 2874.96
though

2872.16 --> 2874.96
i like

2876.8 --> 2881.52
they're all straw manning and [ __ ] and

2878.96 --> 2883.92
of all the pile of fallacies but yeah we

2881.52 --> 2887.359
can definitely talk about the tides

2883.92 --> 2889.2000000000003
on the flat earth right like what is the

2887.359 --> 2892.48
data we have

2889.2 --> 2895.2
i talked about it yesterday on the show

2892.48 --> 2898.0
what is the data we have well you got

2895.2 --> 2903.4399999999996
the tide map

2898.0 --> 2903.44
maybe i could just look it up preferably

2912.839 --> 2920.64
animated

2915.68 --> 2920.64
oh god no that's not the tide map

2920.96 --> 2929.839
these are all silly globe descriptions

2925.119 --> 2929.839
it actually

2930.16 --> 2933.7599999999998
i mean the where is it

2936.079 --> 2943.8390000000004
is this the one

2951.599 --> 2958.6400000000003
ah right here it is

2955.68 --> 2958.64
title range

2963.119 --> 2971.839
i wish i could find the animated one

2993.28 --> 3000.1600000000003
right but yeah this is taking too long

2997.68 --> 3002.5589999999997
to continue what i was talking about

3000.16 --> 3005.2799999999997
hopefully i will find the actual tide

3002.559 --> 3005.28
map to show

3009.839 --> 3013.2799999999997
every every place where there's tides

3011.92 --> 3015.44
going on

3013.28 --> 3017.599
you could best see it in the animated

3015.44 --> 3020.88
version the problem is i'm not finding

3017.599 --> 3020.88
the animated version

3024.16 --> 3029.52
i'm terrible search engine guy

3029.76 --> 3033.76
it's all places where there is rotation

3033.04 --> 3037.52
going on

3033.76 --> 3039.119
it's all all of it all these spots on

3037.52 --> 3042.64
earth and there is like this

3039.119 --> 3044.1600000000003
thing like a scoop almost spinning there

3042.64 --> 3047.359
locally and this just

3044.16 --> 3050.8799999999997
immediately reminds me of local

3047.359 --> 3053.04
magnetic effects

3050.88 --> 3054.6400000000003
but it's correlatory right but it is

3053.04 --> 3056.72
probably magnetics

3054.64 --> 3059.359
also it has to do something with the

3056.72 --> 3061.52
amount of iron in the ground

3059.359 --> 3063.92
so places where there's a lot of iron in

3061.52 --> 3066.48
the ground or in mountains

3063.92 --> 3067.359
it typically becomes more pronounced the

3066.48 --> 3069.92
tides become

3067.359 --> 3071.04
stronger because of that wherever that

3069.92 --> 3074.4
iron

3071.04 --> 3075.359
content is rich it's interesting so it

3074.4 --> 3078.7200000000003
seems just

3075.359 --> 3082.319
seems magnetic but it's

3078.72 --> 3084.3999999999996
what it isn't is a giant bulge of water

3082.319 --> 3087.92
migrating around the world

3084.4 --> 3090.319
in direct lockstep with the moon

3087.92 --> 3092.0
that is what it's not because there can

3090.319 --> 3093.2799999999997
be one spot where there's tides

3092.0 --> 3095.359
happening

3093.28 --> 3096.48
and another spot like on the other side

3095.359 --> 3100.48
of a

3096.48 --> 3103.28
of a big ocean in between it's still

3100.48 --> 3105.44
nothing happens there is no tide there

3103.28 --> 3107.119
might be slight pull here and there

3105.44 --> 3108.88
but in the middle of it there's nothing

3107.119 --> 3112.319
it's still

3108.88 --> 3112.96
right so it's not a giant bulge my

3112.319 --> 3116.319
creating

3112.96 --> 3121.92
no the tide map show it

3116.319 --> 3121.92
tides are local magnetic phenomena

3122.839 --> 3131.119
like little spoons just

3127.04 --> 3134.16
staring their tea in the ocean

3131.119 --> 3134.1600000000003
that's what it looks like

3137.68 --> 3142.72
yeah let's let's just call it say it

3139.76 --> 3147.44
like that to get a little silly

3142.72 --> 3150.16
tides are called caused by angel spoons

3147.44 --> 3151.2000000000003
just spooning it like they've giant

3150.16 --> 3154.72
metal spoons

3151.2 --> 3167.839
and they spoon stir around

3154.72 --> 3167.839
the ocean

3168.8 --> 3172.1600000000003
just yeah so you can conjure that

3170.72 --> 3174.0789999999997
picture in your head i'm not

3172.16 --> 3176.319
literally claiming there are literal

3174.079 --> 3181.8390000000004
angels doing that of course this is

3176.319 --> 3181.839
metaphorical to archetypalize it

3183.04 --> 3186.319
irwin said that we have tights because

3185.52 --> 3189.92
cause of

3186.319 --> 3189.92
spinning what

3190.079 --> 3195.8390000000004
i didn't say that at all neil

3200.16 --> 3207.2
or not spinning of the earth at least

3203.599 --> 3210.6400000000003
it's local it's a local little

3207.2 --> 3214.0789999999997
spoon stirring the ocean

3210.64 --> 3214.0789999999997
and it's probably magnetic

3221.28 --> 3226.88
yeah not earth spin though neil

3224.72 --> 3237.839
locally flat what no i'm not acting like

3226.88 --> 3237.839
baldwin right now

3244.559 --> 3249.599
hey hey burn

3247.76 --> 3251.0400000000004
fat till my stomach is as flat as the

3249.599 --> 3254.1600000000003
earth

3251.04 --> 3257.44
tell the globers to tell us how

3254.16 --> 3260.64
diurnal tides work

3257.44 --> 3263.52
take it that that's where there's tides

3260.64 --> 3266.16
two times a day there's places where

3263.52 --> 3269.52
there's even three tights

3266.16 --> 3269.52
in a day really weird

3271.52 --> 3276.839
well they don't it has nothing to do

3275.28 --> 3279.8390000000004
with the moon

3276.839 --> 3279.839
indeed

3281.76 --> 3286.1600000000003
a local magnetic tornado well a tornado

3285.44 --> 3290.839
is

3286.16 --> 3293.92
based on aerodynamics and turbulence

3290.839 --> 3294.24
magnetics absolutely doesn't so i don't

3293.92 --> 3297.799
know

3294.24 --> 3306.799
a magnetic tornado seems kind of this

3297.799 --> 3308.4
incompatible thing

3306.799 --> 3310.48
and it's not a tornado because it

3308.4 --> 3311.76
doesn't happen that quick it's more like

3310.48 --> 3314.96
a big

3311.76 --> 3321.8390000000004
giant angelic magnetic spoon just

3314.96 --> 3321.839
locally stirring it

3332.0 --> 3335.839
what do you think of my angelic spoon

3346.839 --> 3349.839
analogy

3360.839 --> 3363.839
ah

3366.96 --> 3371.359
and i'm gonna finish this entire bottle

3374.839 --> 3377.839
nice

3379.71 --> 3382.88
[Music]

3388.839 --> 3394.24
ugh

3390.88 --> 3398.559
hello psychics traveler

3394.24 --> 3404.06
gay fish two whales spooning

3398.559 --> 3408.429
created coriolis affected the glow model

3404.06 --> 3408.429
[Music]

3412.319 --> 3419.839
that's quite an image

3428.96 --> 3432.0
my god there's all kinds of silly things

3431.04 --> 3434.24
unfolding in my

3432.0 --> 3434.24
head

3436.72 --> 3441.7599999999998
based on what you just said

3439.839 --> 3442.88
so i'm now thinking of like a bbc

3441.76 --> 3446.48
documentary

3442.88 --> 3448.559
the voice guy actually explaining that

3446.48 --> 3450.319
there's like a nature documentary

3448.559 --> 3452.6400000000003
starter with whales

3450.319 --> 3454.48
spooning each other and then claim of

3452.64 --> 3456.799
how that kind of creates some kind of

3454.48 --> 3459.04
magnetic effect

3456.799 --> 3461.2
and then literally like zooming out and

3459.04 --> 3463.92
transitioning explaining how it causes

3461.2 --> 3475.839
the coriolis effect

3463.92 --> 3475.839
it's terrible

3495.44 --> 3503.2000000000003
i wonder though you know

3499.119 --> 3506.6400000000003
if the tides are caused

3503.2 --> 3509.04
by a magnetic effect how does this

3506.64 --> 3512.319
magnetic effect

3509.04 --> 3512.319
influence life

3512.799 --> 3519.28
is there like a different type of

3515.359 --> 3519.2799999999997
behavioral response from

3520.88 --> 3525.76
aquatic life when they are like in the

3524.88 --> 3529.359
middle of

3525.76 --> 3531.92
the the extra pressure i guess

3529.359 --> 3534.0789999999997
from the push of the magnetics like do

3531.92 --> 3537.52
they behave differently do they go seek

3534.079 --> 3540.6400000000003
it out for some reason or avoid it

3537.52 --> 3544.48
how does that work has anybody ever

3540.64 --> 3547.2799999999997
thought about testing that

3544.48 --> 3550.64
right because creatures are very sense

3547.28 --> 3553.119
sensitive to magnetics

3550.64 --> 3555.1189999999997
that's already been established birds

3553.119 --> 3558.799
and insects

3555.119 --> 3562.0
so how about the aquatic life do they

3558.799 --> 3562.0
have a response to

3562.079 --> 3566.319
to magnetic tide influences

3569.92 --> 3573.6800000000003
like are there physiological processes

3572.48 --> 3578.4
that set in

3573.68 --> 3578.3999999999996
for example because of the magnetic

3584.839 --> 3587.839
influence

3598.839 --> 3601.839
so

3612.839 --> 3615.839
hmm

3620.48 --> 3626.839
yeah i am claiming though ty

3623.599 --> 3629.839
tony i know nathan isn't claiming

3626.839 --> 3629.839
anything

3633.76 --> 3637.599
i just laid down a whole bunch of

3636.0 --> 3641.28
explanations

3637.599 --> 3642.7200000000003
with minor claims that well invite to

3641.28 --> 3646.3190000000004
test

3642.72 --> 3650.319
right because i'm a theorist

3646.319 --> 3657.839
i typically don't do it myself but i

3650.319 --> 3657.839
dig up ideas

3668.839 --> 3671.839
ah

3680.799 --> 3686.72
is a natural phenomena

3684.24 --> 3686.72
pat v

3689.68 --> 3692.799
i explained it

3692.96 --> 3702.079
what's the issue here

3698.16 --> 3705.5989999999997
wait what can you actually explain

3702.079 --> 3705.599
on your globe model

3705.92 --> 3711.839
the the mapping of the local title

3709.44 --> 3714.0
steering

3711.839 --> 3715.599
why didn't you model that out on your

3714.0 --> 3717.359
globe model where it's supposed to be

3715.599 --> 3719.2000000000003
caused by the moon which is

3717.359 --> 3720.88
absolutely ridiculous and it doesn't

3719.2 --> 3724.3999999999996
happen right so

3720.88 --> 3726.4
you explain that what you're gonna try

3724.4 --> 3728.64
the molten iron core as a cause it's

3726.4 --> 3741.839
magnetic

3728.64 --> 3741.839
how does that work then

3753.44 --> 3757.599
fear rises without testing

3761.039 --> 3767.28
dude well it can be tested what that

3763.76 --> 3770.3190000000004
means that i have to do it

3767.28 --> 3773.119
little old arwen with

3770.319 --> 3775.359
barely enough funds to just get around

3773.119 --> 3783.119
and stay healthy

3775.359 --> 3787.359
how am i gonna do that

3783.119 --> 3787.359
okay no need to go there

3793.92 --> 3797.839
that's not the issue oh really

3798.48 --> 3805.92
well what is the issue then tiny wumble

3802.799 --> 3809.359
you wanted an explanation

3805.92 --> 3810.0
right on the flat earth well that's what

3809.359 --> 3812.16
i did

3810.0 --> 3813.76
i basically went with yeah we know the

3812.16 --> 3817.2799999999997
earth is flat

3813.76 --> 3817.92
here's some data what do i make of that

3817.28 --> 3820.0
data

3817.92 --> 3821.039
right the data is data it's there it's

3820.0 --> 3824.079
consistent

3821.039 --> 3825.6800000000003
there's patterns right those patterns

3824.079 --> 3828.079
can be cross-referenced with other

3825.68 --> 3830.8799999999997
patterns and experiences

3828.079 --> 3831.76
to get a clue as to what is actually

3830.88 --> 3834.4
happening there

3831.76 --> 3839.3590000000004
what is the phenomenon well i dug into

3834.4 --> 3842.48
that extensively

3839.359 --> 3845.52
and kind of jokingly ended up calling it

3842.48 --> 3845.52
angel spoons

3845.92 --> 3850.4
but it's magnetic because that's exactly

3848.72 --> 3852.319
what it looks like

3850.4 --> 3853.839
now unless you can show me a

3852.319 --> 3855.839
non-magnetic effect

3853.839 --> 3867.839
that will typically yield this sort of

3855.839 --> 3867.839
patterns i'd like to know about it

3883.839 --> 3891.44
maybe you could call the tides

3887.039 --> 3892.8390000000004
like magnetic vortexes maybe

3891.44 --> 3895.119
don't know if that's an appropriate

3892.839 --> 3897.2
association

3895.119 --> 3898.7200000000003
it is something stirring right so

3897.2 --> 3902.5589999999997
vortexes do

3898.72 --> 3902.5589999999997
typically have that pattern as well

3905.599 --> 3912.1600000000003
on the other hand it's yeah no

3908.799 --> 3923.839
it really is more like like a spoon

3912.16 --> 3923.839
that's just turning

3942.079 --> 3945.28
right yeah pat fee

3946.079 --> 3953.039
look if you really want to

3949.44 --> 3954.7200000000003
understand in depth analysis you just

3953.039 --> 3958.0
got one

3954.72 --> 3960.72
with the data available what more do you

3958.0 --> 3964.76
want from me

3960.72 --> 3967.7599999999998
right and then just a reminder

3964.76 --> 3971.76
heliocentrism doesn't even

3967.76 --> 3974.48
address the freaking tide map

3971.76 --> 3976.88
okay it just lays down that stupid claim

3974.48 --> 3979.2
of tidal waves caused by the moon's

3976.88 --> 3981.119
gravitational pull based on newtonian

3979.2 --> 3986.0
mechanics

3981.119 --> 3989.44
yeah that's the heliocentric claim

3986.0 --> 3993.839
hasn't been very updated

3989.44 --> 3993.839
since it was first conceived like that

3995.119 --> 4002.7200000000003
so yeah you your model doesn't even

3998.72 --> 4007.9199999999996
address the actual field data

4002.72 --> 4010.64
okay pet fee so are you gonna settle now

4007.92 --> 4012.2400000000002
for our explanation that at least

4010.64 --> 4021.839
addresses

4012.24 --> 4021.839
the field data pathway

4023.02 --> 4027.889
[Music]

4046.839 --> 4049.839
ugh

4051.91 --> 4058.0899999999997
[Music]

4077.2 --> 4081.68
yeah tiny womble the thing is though

4080.88 --> 4085.599
about the

4081.68 --> 4089.52
tights regular s clockwork

4085.599 --> 4092.4
yeah you you realize though that those

4089.52 --> 4094.079
tights regular as clockwork i'm going to

4092.4 --> 4095.2000000000003
say it a couple of times because you

4094.079 --> 4096.56
said that

4095.2 --> 4100.239
i'm going to make a point and i'm not

4096.56 --> 4104.159000000001
going to allow you to escape that point

4100.239 --> 4107.599999999999
those tights regular as clockwork

4104.159 --> 4110.239
based on a 24 hour

4107.6 --> 4110.2390000000005
cycle

4111.12 --> 4119.839
the moon is not

4115.12 --> 4119.839
a 24 hour cycle

4120.08 --> 4133.839
yeah now you deal with that

4144.839 --> 4147.839
foreign

4159.359 --> 4175.839
high tide approximately 45 minutes later

4162.4 --> 4175.839
every what

4179.04 --> 4182.719
are you say wait what

4185.199 --> 4190.4
so they're not a 24-hour cycle really

4187.759 --> 4190.4
tights are

4191.199 --> 4203.839999999999
like not in tune with a 24-hour cycle

4196.48 --> 4203.839999999999
seeking star water

4214.84 --> 4217.84
ugh

4224.4 --> 4231.44
hmm okay

4227.76 --> 4233.92
well i guess you can scrap that previous

4231.44 --> 4235.36
thing i said that i thought i was really

4233.92 --> 4238.4
smart when i said it

4235.36 --> 4242.839999999999
because apparently the tides are not

4238.4 --> 4245.28
in tune with the 24-hour cycle okay

4242.84 --> 4247.12
great well maybe that's where they got

4245.28 --> 4249.92
it from them maybe it is in tune with

4247.12 --> 4249.92
the moon cycle

4251.28 --> 4255.679
and because it is they just said okay

4254.08 --> 4258.64
the moon causes it

4255.679 --> 4261.1990000000005
because it aligns with the moon cycle

4258.64 --> 4264.56
for some reason

4261.199 --> 4269.36
or does that mean that the moon

4264.56 --> 4271.1990000000005
causes the magnetic things on earth

4269.36 --> 4274.08
well if you presume that's a giant

4271.199 --> 4275.919999999999
sphere very very far away

4274.08 --> 4278.159
yeah the magnetism is not going to reach

4275.92 --> 4281.84
that far

4278.159 --> 4284.639999999999
right and presuppose gravity

4281.84 --> 4285.360000000001
is not going to cause a spoon like

4284.64 --> 4288.400000000001
effect

4285.36 --> 4291.839999999999
like a magnet to do that to do

4288.4 --> 4291.839999999999
yeah to do that tights

4294.719 --> 4298.08
but apparently there's a direct

4296.96 --> 4300.64
correlation

4298.08 --> 4301.199
so me let's just put it in another way

4300.64 --> 4303.04
if you just

4301.199 --> 4306.239
let go of the physicality assumption

4303.04 --> 4306.239
bias for a few minutes

4306.4 --> 4309.599999999999
figure out okay the moon is a giant

4308.4 --> 4312.879999999999
luminary

4309.6 --> 4314.4800000000005
it's a big light something is causing

4312.88 --> 4316.4800000000005
that light

4314.48 --> 4318.5599999999995
well maybe you could state that the

4316.48 --> 4322.239
thing that causes the light

4318.56 --> 4325.679
is the same thing that feeds

4322.239 --> 4328.48
the magnetic spoon effect

4325.679 --> 4329.1990000000005
that causes the local tights based on

4328.48 --> 4332.959999999999
the amount of

4329.199 --> 4334.799999999999
iron in the ground right so it's not the

4332.96 --> 4338.159
moon that's causing it it's the same

4334.8 --> 4340.96
thing that causes the moon causes it

4338.159 --> 4342.4
so it's kind of tapped into the same

4340.96 --> 4344.96
energy source

4342.4 --> 4347.839999999999
something like that it gets all kind of

4344.96 --> 4347.84
vague like this

4362.8 --> 4371.84
don't be gay clutch bear

4397.76 --> 4404.8
sun and moon well what if

4400.88 --> 4408.88
not maybe it's the same format

4404.8 --> 4408.88
george sanford it's the the same

4410.08 --> 4415.28
system but not the same source right

4415.92 --> 4420.2390000000005
it's just the same mechanism just not

4418.48 --> 4424.839999999999
the same source

4420.239 --> 4426.718999999999
could be many different electric

4424.84 --> 4428.719
sources

4426.719 --> 4441.84
that are allowing all the separate

4428.719 --> 4441.84
luminaries to come into being

4448.32 --> 4452.48
right if you conceive it like that then

4451.12 --> 4456.239
you might even call

4452.48 --> 4462.159
the luminary spheres of influence ooh

4456.239 --> 4462.159
how that ties in fractal thinking wise

4462.32 --> 4466.159
right because that's kind of like how

4464.719 --> 4468.2390000000005
astrology is

4466.159 --> 4470.159
put together it's like a sphere of

4468.239 --> 4471.599999999999
influence like this planet is a sphere

4470.159 --> 4474.799999999999
of influence and when it's

4471.6 --> 4477.280000000001
like at this peak that's when this fear

4474.8 --> 4479.76
of influence becomes the strongest

4477.28 --> 4481.12
well maybe that same sphere of

4479.76 --> 4483.679
influences

4481.12 --> 4486.64
right that has with the loom with

4483.679 --> 4489.1990000000005
luminary of the moon

4486.64 --> 4491.04
it causes the moon it might cause the

4489.199 --> 4496.32
tides because of the

4491.04 --> 4499.5199999999995
this time cyclical correlation

4496.32 --> 4502.639999999999
right well maybe that same thing is also

4499.52 --> 4505.679
the effect that can influence you

4502.64 --> 4508.159000000001
as a person as how people

4505.679 --> 4510.2390000000005
typically can respond to for example

4508.159 --> 4512.719
full moons

4510.239 --> 4514.718999999999
right there's been like psychological

4512.719 --> 4517.76
effects attributed to it but it's

4514.719 --> 4520.0
i think it's more than just that so

4517.76 --> 4521.52
yeah the sphere of influence from

4520.0 --> 4524.64
astrology

4521.52 --> 4527.76
maybe it is really a thing

4524.64 --> 4531.679
like palpable and might

4527.76 --> 4534.96
cause physical things in the world light

4531.679 --> 4538.56
magnetic effects and it's just set

4534.96 --> 4542.0
it's that sphere of influence and it's

4538.56 --> 4544.96
it's placed cyclical

4542.0 --> 4544.96
in the sky clock

4545.12 --> 4552.8
so now it's all just magic oh

4548.56 --> 4555.92
yeah reality is magic it's very magical

4552.8 --> 4555.92
it's a giant puzzle

4556.08 --> 4561.44
and there's all kinds of deterrents

4559.199 --> 4563.36
priesthood indoctrinations that tell you

4561.44 --> 4564.879999999999
to don't don't think about that don't

4563.36 --> 4567.759999999999
consider that

4564.88 --> 4570.400000000001
that's a lie or you're stupid when you

4567.76 --> 4570.400000000001
think like that

4572.32 --> 4581.84
right taking away the palpability

4576.64 --> 4581.84
of things to use it against you

4606.84 --> 4609.84
foreign

4627.52 --> 4640.64
no seeking star wars absolutely not

4636.4 --> 4640.639999999999
about kadabra is something else

4646.159 --> 4652.159
right it is a spell the alphabet is not

4660.239 --> 4666.879999999999
hello paul connell i'm not

4663.44 --> 4679.839999999999
ballwin though not right now

4666.88 --> 4679.84
you'll know when i'm ballwin

4695.36 --> 4707.839999999999
all right mother's funeral yesterday

4747.04 --> 4752.32
yep sidekicks traveler

4750.56 --> 4755.1990000000005
that's the amazing thing about fiber

4752.32 --> 4755.199
optics cable

4755.52 --> 4763.84
it's light it's light based

4759.76 --> 4763.84
and light is incredibly fast

4764.08 --> 4771.679
right so when if you would say

4768.12 --> 4774.719
560 miles of fiber optic

4771.679 --> 4779.04
well the amount of time it takes to go

4774.719 --> 4782.719
through all those 560 miles for light

4779.04 --> 4786.4
is astonishingly short think about it

4782.719 --> 4786.4
it's it uses light

4788.84 --> 4793.1990000000005
right

4790.48 --> 4804.159
because light fiber optics are much

4793.199 --> 4806.879999999999
faster than electrics much much faster

4804.159 --> 4809.679
ah oh thank you very much paul connell i

4806.88 --> 4811.92
really appreciate that

4809.679 --> 4813.12
i i'm i'm glad you're enjoying my

4811.92 --> 4818.32
ballwin

4813.12 --> 4820.48
thing that i sometimes do

4818.32 --> 4824.32
i can't do it always because it it does

4820.48 --> 4824.32
get on like people's nerves

4824.48 --> 4828.48
at at least with the flat earth debate

4826.639 --> 4831.52
crew because i will

4828.48 --> 4833.678999999999
like rumpus just keep reasserting the

4831.52 --> 4836.0
ideas because you have to

4833.679 --> 4837.04
there has to be a solution okay does it

4836.0 --> 4840.239
make

4837.04 --> 4840.239
it's not flawless

4841.04 --> 4845.6
but if it's a better solution than none

4844.48 --> 4848.718999999999
at all it's at least

4845.6 --> 4851.1990000000005
something right that's kind of how

4848.719 --> 4851.199
ballwin

4858.84 --> 4861.84
operates

4866.32 --> 4879.36
hey drunken bullet for everyone

4875.28 --> 4882.239
yeah yeah exactly paul kono i agree

4879.36 --> 4882.88
because it's really kind of a shame that

4882.239 --> 4884.959999999999
rump is

4882.88 --> 4886.08
that nathan's just too sick of rumpus or

4884.96 --> 4889.679
something

4886.08 --> 4890.719
and i understand but every time rhombus

4889.679 --> 4895.12
comes on

4890.719 --> 4899.04
literally i i just can't stop laughing

4895.12 --> 4901.5199999999995
he's so hilarious and

4899.04 --> 4902.32
i wonder if he even has the ability to

4901.52 --> 4905.92
realize

4902.32 --> 4907.599999999999
how hilarious it is from a flat earth

4905.92 --> 4910.56
perspective

4907.6 --> 4914.0
if you don't yeah it's it's like this

4910.56 --> 4916.400000000001
weird little magic spectacle

4914.0 --> 4918.08
so yeah and then nathan kind of banned

4916.4 --> 4920.48
him

4918.08 --> 4922.0
and so i was kind of i felt forced to

4920.48 --> 4926.239
fill the void alone

4922.0 --> 4926.239
it's like no people need their rompers

4929.36 --> 4935.04
and yeah i can use it to bait ballers

4931.92 --> 4935.04
into a conversation

4942.84 --> 4946.96
right

4944.88 --> 4947.92
it does feel a little mean though

4946.96 --> 4951.04
sometimes

4947.92 --> 4953.76
right like baldwin

4951.04 --> 4954.719
does not like overly likes to like to be

4953.76 --> 4957.92
used

4954.719 --> 4958.2390000000005
like as a slave by flat earthers because

4957.92 --> 4963.4400000000005
it

4958.239 --> 4963.44
is like a genuine thing it's weird

4964.48 --> 4969.44
so the idea that he would be used as

4967.52 --> 4973.76
like a

4969.44 --> 4976.799999999999
a bait on a

4973.76 --> 4979.52
on a stick or something just to get the

4976.8 --> 4982.320000000001
globbers in

4979.52 --> 4987.84
right eventually that'll tire me out as

4982.32 --> 4987.84
bowen because i want to be taken serious

4994.239 --> 5001.5199999999995
right but in a way i do hope that like

4997.52 --> 5002.0
his spirit which is a little naive but

5001.52 --> 5005.76
still

5002.0 --> 5009.199
very well willing and good it's like

5005.76 --> 5009.679
wanting to follow christ but not finding

5009.199 --> 5013.599999999999
it

5009.679 --> 5015.76
finding a technical way to just do it

5013.6 --> 5016.8
because of well the belief structure

5015.76 --> 5019.679
that you're bound to

5016.8 --> 5020.96
like that but still trying to carry the

5019.679 --> 5022.88
spirit through

5020.96 --> 5024.8
and i hope that some of that is even

5022.88 --> 5026.639
kind of trickling down to any

5024.8 --> 5029.84
unsuspecting

5026.639 --> 5032.32
regular ball believers

5029.84 --> 5033.52
i hope that i can kind of kindle the

5032.32 --> 5038.0
same flame that i

5033.52 --> 5042.320000000001
felt like just passion for the globe

5038.0 --> 5046.159
but without the nasty fanaticism

5042.32 --> 5048.159
like without letting it become nasty

5046.159 --> 5050.638999999999
to see it more as a game as this

5048.159 --> 5053.679
magnificent

5050.639 --> 5056.400000000001
toy that we as

5053.679 --> 5057.52
intellectual humanity get to use and

5056.4 --> 5060.799999999999
exploit

5057.52 --> 5060.8
and test ourselves with

5067.52 --> 5074.080000000001
do i know owen oh yeah owen yeah

5071.84 --> 5074.08
that

5075.28 --> 5082.239
uh yeah i think there's probably like a

5078.08 --> 5085.76
million people in the world called owen

5082.239 --> 5087.599999999999
maybe only a hundred thousand

5085.76 --> 5090.0
now what am i talking about probably a

5087.6 --> 5090.0
million

5090.8 --> 5097.1990000000005
but do you mean owen benjamin

5094.4 --> 5100.32
yeah yeah of course i know him i talk

5097.199 --> 5100.32
about him all the time

5101.38 --> 5107.28
[Music]

5103.679 --> 5113.84
i i ask people to rogan's up videos

5107.28 --> 5113.84
because of home benjamin

5122.56 --> 5126.96
wow thank you paul connell i really

5124.88 --> 5129.679
appreciate the

5126.96 --> 5129.679
compliments

5134.08 --> 5141.84
i'm very happy to be appreciated

5142.56 --> 5146.639
ah all right bear witness

5147.38 --> 5152.0
[Music]

5150.0 --> 5155.84
yeah we we cut a couple of bears with

5152.0 --> 5155.84
wrenches in here

5158.35 --> 5162.4490000000005
[Music]

5176.56 --> 5183.84
just getting on in here

5191.6 --> 5196.719
how do you get a wrench well you have to

5194.08 --> 5199.6
earn one

5196.719 --> 5201.76
by just being present giving me an

5199.6 --> 5206.320000000001
opportunity to

5201.76 --> 5206.320000000001
see how your character responds

5206.639 --> 5211.84
i just gotta get to know you a little

5214.48 --> 5219.44
that's pretty much it and hey there's

5217.199 --> 5221.678999999999
people in here that have had wrenches

5219.44 --> 5224.32
and had them taken away again and even

5221.679 --> 5226.32
given back and taken away ben again

5224.32 --> 5228.639
based on their behavior right because if

5226.32 --> 5231.36
you have a wrench

5228.639 --> 5231.84
that's like a level up you you gotta

5231.36 --> 5234.639
wield

5231.84 --> 5237.12
the rent you gotta be responsible right

5234.639 --> 5240.4800000000005
it requires a certain code

5237.12 --> 5245.92
of conduct that's not fully spoken

5240.48 --> 5245.919999999999
but partially to wield that wrench

5248.4 --> 5253.44
and yeah there's rules in the

5250.88 --> 5256.8
description box of the youtube video

5253.44 --> 5259.919999999999
the live chat rules and that may

5256.8 --> 5267.84
enlighten a little

5259.92 --> 5267.84
about how that works

5270.4 --> 5274.48
what are my raising donations for

5274.98 --> 5280.32
[Music]

5277.12 --> 5283.679
well for my living

5280.32 --> 5283.679
really at the time

5290.159 --> 5301.199
for yeah expenses food

5295.52 --> 5301.1990000000005
uh staying out of debt helps a lot

5301.28 --> 5309.44
and i don't know i am kind of like

5305.36 --> 5312.639
been sitting on

5309.44 --> 5316.08
plans to kind of maneuver

5312.639 --> 5318.08
out of a more out of this more modest

5316.08 --> 5319.12
i can't call myself poor but a more

5318.08 --> 5322.159
modest position

5319.12 --> 5325.04
financially maybe yeah get towards

5322.159 --> 5328.08
getting a garden or something

5325.04 --> 5330.8
that's directly next to me how about

5328.08 --> 5332.32
more than one single room would be great

5330.8 --> 5334.719
right but all these things are not

5332.32 --> 5336.159
really easy to get

5334.719 --> 5338.96
in the netherlands where everything is

5336.159 --> 5343.28
expensive as [ __ ]

5338.96 --> 5345.76
so i hope to

5343.28 --> 5346.96
i hope to not spend like literally the

5345.76 --> 5348.96
next five years

5346.96 --> 5350.0
sitting in this room doing this show

5348.96 --> 5354.0
every day

5350.0 --> 5354.0
right i've been doing it for now

5354.239 --> 5359.599999999999
four years and

5357.44 --> 5361.919999999999
i don't want to do it another five years

5359.6 --> 5365.4400000000005
this is

5361.92 --> 5366.56
not here in this setting i at some point

5365.44 --> 5369.919999999999
i want to kind of

5366.56 --> 5372.4800000000005
like move on to a better location

5369.92 --> 5373.52
and then maybe even expand like my

5372.48 --> 5377.36
technical

5373.52 --> 5380.8
setup that i might have a mobile camera

5377.36 --> 5382.88
that i can even use all that right ideas

5380.8 --> 5392.639
are plenty

5382.88 --> 5394.88
it's just gotta get there

5392.639 --> 5395.92
uh burn fat till my stomach is his

5394.88 --> 5399.4400000000005
flattest

5395.92 --> 5400.2390000000005
yeah that's not a question meant for me

5399.44 --> 5406.239
is it

5400.239 --> 5408.799999999999
that's a question meant for akuma virus

5406.239 --> 5411.599999999999
now i i can assure you that my pants are

5408.8 --> 5415.679
in the same reference frame as me

5411.6 --> 5421.84
don't worry about it i'm not

5415.679 --> 5421.84
like a cnn reporter

5460.84 --> 5463.84
hey

5470.32 --> 5474.96
with your shoe now that is another

5472.4 --> 5478.0
reference frame

5474.96 --> 5480.2390000000005
now if you're on a roundabout and you

5478.0 --> 5482.0
lose a shoe while you're on the

5480.239 --> 5483.678999999999
roundabout then eventually it's going to

5482.0 --> 5491.84
fly off

5483.679 --> 5491.84
into the other reference frame

5502.84 --> 5505.84
indeed

5516.84 --> 5519.84
hmm

5530.84 --> 5533.84
so

5558.84 --> 5561.84
hmm

5572.84 --> 5575.84
so

5581.04 --> 5584.56
ah you're fasting right now

5587.28 --> 5589.84
all right

5593.679 --> 5599.52
yeah yesterday the show was all about

5595.84 --> 5599.52
food but let's not do that today

5601.36 --> 5604.239
come on it was

5605.12 --> 5617.84
be back in two minutes

5738.0 --> 5744.88
oh okay wow you're very eager to donate

5741.119 --> 5744.88
bear witness i appreciate that

5754.84 --> 5760.0
right but yeah i have a whole record

5761.119 --> 5764.08
and my

5764.32 --> 5766.639
let's just

5768.32 --> 5777.28
heat my proposal is pretty basic

5773.199 --> 5781.119
you guys keep me stocked up

5777.28 --> 5784.32
on cash i keep going

5781.119 --> 5786.4
and well the yeah because

5784.32 --> 5788.639
in the past and i've been doing this for

5786.4 --> 5792.08
a couple of years and in the past i had

5788.639 --> 5794.8
like financial burdens there was like

5792.08 --> 5795.5199999999995
really nagging on me literally even

5794.8 --> 5798.96
causing

5795.52 --> 5801.679
paranoia just very unpleasant i don't

5798.96 --> 5805.52
respond well to

5801.679 --> 5809.52
to yeah shortage

5805.52 --> 5811.679
and that's been visible

5809.52 --> 5813.280000000001
and well and over the years i've just

5811.679 --> 5815.1990000000005
shown like i yeah i do

5813.28 --> 5816.88
i really do a show every day and i

5815.199 --> 5820.159
always have

5816.88 --> 5822.2390000000005
same objectives like

5820.159 --> 5823.92
sometimes i might not be in the best of

5822.239 --> 5825.119
conditions and then i'll be honest about

5823.92 --> 5826.88
it and see what i can get

5825.119 --> 5830.08
out of it still and other times i'll be

5826.88 --> 5833.4800000000005
fully restored and i'll just boost

5830.08 --> 5836.4
but as long as there's no financial

5833.48 --> 5838.239
insecurities in the background of my

5836.4 --> 5840.4
mind

5838.239 --> 5841.759999999999
it's kind of empirical that i perform

5840.4 --> 5846.08
better

5841.76 --> 5848.2390000000005
i do and i hope i've proven that

5846.08 --> 5849.6
it's it's been we've had some weird

5848.239 --> 5854.799999999999
moments where i would

5849.6 --> 5857.360000000001
literally kind of be begging for it

5854.8 --> 5858.4800000000005
because yeah i would run out of like

5857.36 --> 5861.199
money for food

5858.48 --> 5863.28
like on it like okay i only have food

5861.199 --> 5865.759999999999
for tomorrow that kind of situation

5863.28 --> 5869.679
like really needing it and then somebody

5865.76 --> 5874.4800000000005
boosts me a big amount

5869.679 --> 5876.719
uh thanks paul connell

5874.48 --> 5878.0
and then when they do it it like has a

5876.719 --> 5882.4800000000005
really big impact

5878.0 --> 5885.44
on camera like really

5882.48 --> 5887.759999999999
so yeah that's that's the setup i'm i'm

5885.44 --> 5889.678999999999
kind of like a street artist i do this i

5887.76 --> 5891.280000000001
do this every day you can always find me

5889.679 --> 5893.52
in the same spot

5891.28 --> 5894.88
kind of do the same thing but still keep

5893.52 --> 5897.84
developing

5894.88 --> 5897.84
and yeah

5898.639 --> 5902.8
financial support is really what keeps

5900.88 --> 5904.639
me going is what keeps me fat and that's

5902.8 --> 5907.679
my setup

5904.639 --> 5908.8
right yeah thank you paul connelly or is

5907.679 --> 5912.32
it cuddle

5908.8 --> 5913.52
yeah for the 1499 australian super chat

5912.32 --> 5915.36
donation

5913.52 --> 5916.719
i'm afraid that's not gonna buy me a

5915.36 --> 5919.5199999999995
shirt though because

5916.719 --> 5919.52
super chats

5920.08 --> 5924.08
they're kind of a billboard but because

5923.04 --> 5927.119
of my

5924.08 --> 5927.679
setup i i don't really get anything out

5927.119 --> 5931.119
of it

5927.679 --> 5934.159
i might get like a percent

5931.119 --> 5935.759999999999
the total amount you that you put down i

5934.159 --> 5937.839999999999
will eventually like

5935.76 --> 5938.88
get to keep one percent of it it's

5937.84 --> 5940.88
really

5938.88 --> 5942.4800000000005
kind of pathetic so if you actually want

5940.88 --> 5944.400000000001
to help me out

5942.48 --> 5946.879999999999
i have to ask that you donate to my

5944.4 --> 5949.36
paypal instead if you can

5946.88 --> 5951.119
because that way i get the full amount

5949.36 --> 5953.92
and i get it pretty quick

5951.119 --> 5955.599999999999
because through the super chats on

5953.92 --> 5958.2390000000005
google

5955.6 --> 5958.96
and youtube it takes quite a while

5958.239 --> 5962.879999999999
before it

5958.96 --> 5962.88
even arrives in my bank account

5963.28 --> 5970.08
and because of my income limits

5967.76 --> 5972.159000000001
uh yeah i am on social welfare i hope

5970.08 --> 5976.8
that's

5972.159 --> 5976.799999999999
like yeah i'll be honest about it

5977.04 --> 5980.159
i don't have like another job beside

5979.679 --> 5983.52
this

5980.159 --> 5984.638999999999
to to keep myself going so i live on

5983.52 --> 5986.639
social welfare

5984.639 --> 5989.119
and i'm okay with it i can do it i've

5986.639 --> 5992.4800000000005
survived it

5989.119 --> 5994.32
uh but because of that

5992.48 --> 5996.32
everything that it comes in through

5994.32 --> 5998.719
google eventually gets taken

5996.32 --> 6000.5599999999995
out of my paycheck from the social

5998.719 --> 6001.679
welfare so i literally get nothing out

6000.56 --> 6004.0
of it

6001.679 --> 6006.159
but it is good for stats right it's like

6004.0 --> 6008.48
okay you gotta

6006.159 --> 6010.5599999999995
also show the government that you're at

6008.48 --> 6013.678999999999
least

6010.56 --> 6015.1990000000005
giving some back that you're at least

6013.679 --> 6018.8
trying

6015.199 --> 6021.678999999999
that helps so that's when i say okay

6018.8 --> 6022.4800000000005
getting super chat donations or a lot of

6021.679 --> 6025.1990000000005
members

6022.48 --> 6026.08
of the youtube channel it helps my stats

6025.199 --> 6027.919999999999
because it does

6026.08 --> 6029.92
it doesn't literally help the number in

6027.92 --> 6033.6
my bank account that i have available

6029.92 --> 6037.4400000000005
but it helps the stats so

6033.6 --> 6041.280000000001
that's my situation

6037.44 --> 6041.28
has he gone to the bank too

6041.44 --> 6043.599999999999
no

6049.76 --> 6053.119000000001
but if you donate to my paypal then i'll

6052.56 --> 6064.080000000001
have it

6053.119 --> 6066.96
usually within two days

6064.08 --> 6068.239
and i thank paypal for not getting in my

6066.96 --> 6072.0
way

6068.239 --> 6075.678999999999
for not like yeah making it possible for

6072.0 --> 6077.6
me to use it i'm very happy about that

6075.679 --> 6080.4
because it has been a great solution to

6077.6 --> 6080.400000000001
me so far

6084.159 --> 6087.44
unlike with some other people

6091.36 --> 6093.839999999999
dude

6095.199 --> 6098.799999999999
i'm not buying another shirt i have a

6097.119 --> 6100.4
shirt but i'm not putting it on because

6098.8 --> 6104.84
it's way too warm

6100.4 --> 6107.199
okay get over it today i'm not wearing a

6104.84 --> 6121.84
shirt

6107.199 --> 6121.839999999999
i mean not inside here anyway

6138.8 --> 6141.4400000000005
hey dank

6142.08 --> 6146.48
a long time now speak

6143.38 --> 6149.679
[Music]

6146.48 --> 6152.159
oh wow what an entry okay i'll check my

6149.679 --> 6152.159
paypal

6155.199 --> 6158.799999999999
yeah you've been busy i thought so

6159.84 --> 6163.84
i hope in a good way

6165.6 --> 6180.0
whoa dude thank you so much

6176.159 --> 6182.4
that's great thank you very much dank

6180.0 --> 6182.4
epic

6182.88 --> 6191.84
50 euros freaking awesome

6194.08 --> 6205.84
i will strive to keep performing

6208.32 --> 6212.719
right ironically enough though i'm

6211.119 --> 6215.199
talking about a shirt i may

6212.719 --> 6216.4800000000005
actually get a new shirt somewhere a new

6215.199 --> 6219.839999999999
white one

6216.48 --> 6222.239
because my previous favorite white shirt

6219.84 --> 6222.88
seems to have been kind of like tearing

6222.239 --> 6227.44
itself

6222.88 --> 6230.639
up i think it's kind of worn

6227.44 --> 6233.04
i wore the white shirt too much

6230.639 --> 6236.159000000001
because yeah pretty much throughout the

6233.04 --> 6238.4
year i typically wear the white shirt

6236.159 --> 6240.239
on my skin and then over that i wear

6238.4 --> 6242.879999999999
another black shirt and

6240.239 --> 6242.879999999999
a sweater

6244.239 --> 6248.08
tell me about baldur's gate 3 i'm

6246.4 --> 6250.879999999999
thinking of getting it

6248.08 --> 6250.88
oh dank

6251.84 --> 6255.679
i haven't really played it in a while

6258.84 --> 6263.04
it's

6260.0 --> 6267.28
it's not the same as baldur's gate 2

6263.04 --> 6267.28
and 1 are it's very different

6267.84 --> 6275.76
it reminded me more about dragon age

6272.239 --> 6278.879999999999
but with a lot like the combat

6275.76 --> 6281.4400000000005
mechanics are like a whole new system

6278.88 --> 6285.4400000000005
very detailed and even like with lateral

6281.44 --> 6285.44
movement and climbing and jumping

6285.679 --> 6289.1990000000005
but there's been many issues with the

6287.6 --> 6292.400000000001
game can be very

6289.199 --> 6292.4
slow loading times

6293.76 --> 6302.88
and yeah for so far i did get the game

6299.199 --> 6304.799999999999
but it's basically one area

6302.88 --> 6307.04
it's a pretty big area it's like one

6304.8 --> 6310.159000000001
world map and there's even like oh

6307.04 --> 6312.56
yeah i played it through like twice now

6310.159 --> 6313.839999999999
and it's like yeah go over to that

6312.56 --> 6316.2390000000005
region

6313.84 --> 6318.719
oh you can't go there yet even though

6316.239 --> 6321.919999999999
it's officially out so they're just like

6318.719 --> 6324.32
letting you stay in the first big

6321.92 --> 6324.32
region

6325.6 --> 6332.56
and that's it i don't even know

6329.04 --> 6335.76
when they even plan to continue the rest

6332.56 --> 6338.320000000001
of it even though this is just one part

6335.76 --> 6338.320000000001
of the game

6340.48 --> 6344.08
maybe even like a third or a quarter of

6343.28 --> 6345.92
the whole thing

6344.08 --> 6348.4
but it's been stuck there for a very

6345.92 --> 6348.4
long time

6353.84 --> 6359.84
all right paul connell that's awesome

6355.6 --> 6359.84
thank you

6365.92 --> 6373.76
right maybe i'll

6369.679 --> 6376.96
check it out for a bit

6373.76 --> 6376.96
still have it installed

6377.04 --> 6383.76
i was watching tv not paying us talking

6380.239 --> 6383.759999999999
about baldur's gate 3.

6385.119 --> 6392.639
somebody who was it was it bill g

6389.119 --> 6394.719
like last year december i wanted to buy

6392.639 --> 6396.8
the game

6394.719 --> 6398.8
and then i think it was bill g that like

6396.8 --> 6400.639
donated the full amount

6398.8 --> 6402.56
so that i would actually be able to buy

6400.639 --> 6405.52
it right then

6402.56 --> 6408.96
and i really thank him for that i hope i

6405.52 --> 6408.96
got it right i think it was bill g

6412.84 --> 6415.84
alright

6431.199 --> 6436.32
yeah i know right with tony

6434.719 --> 6437.84
it's all flat because that's the only

6436.32 --> 6441.199
way it looks real

6437.84 --> 6443.76
it's very simple like that

6441.199 --> 6446.32
like oh yeah in the cgi it can be a ball

6443.76 --> 6449.76
from a very big distance right

6446.32 --> 6449.759999999999
but if you're actually like

6450.159 --> 6454.5599999999995
making out little details and features

6454.639 --> 6457.84
to scale and if you're looking at ground

6457.199 --> 6460.32
level

6457.84 --> 6462.56
it has to be flat or it's not going to

6460.32 --> 6465.679
look real

6462.56 --> 6465.679
it's that simple

6468.84 --> 6474.719
okay

6471.679 --> 6474.719
no it's still loading

6480.639 --> 6487.92
can you put any amount into paypal yes

6485.84 --> 6489.04
you could technically like even donate

6487.92 --> 6491.04
like 10 000

6489.04 --> 6493.6
euros or something but i think that

6491.04 --> 6499.84
after a certain amount

6493.6 --> 6499.84
they do start to ask extra fees

6513.6 --> 6519.119000000001
okay oh this is slowing my computer down

6516.32 --> 6522.88
i hope my computer doesn't crash

6519.119 --> 6523.28
because of the heat the game is kind of

6522.88 --> 6527.84
like

6523.28 --> 6527.84
a lot of processor intensive

6528.56 --> 6532.320000000001
the loading is so freaking slow

6535.679 --> 6546.43
ah oh great

6541.8 --> 6546.43
[Music]

6555.28 --> 6559.84
right i don't have a saved game ready

6557.36 --> 6568.08
right now to kind of like show

6559.84 --> 6570.400000000001
how big it is

6568.08 --> 6571.28
can i talk about how you realized effie

6570.4 --> 6573.598999999999
and when

6571.28 --> 6575.599
or paul connell yeah i can but it's such

6573.599 --> 6578.159000000001
a long story i don't yeah i don't really

6575.599 --> 6580.84
have the time left

6578.159 --> 6582.239
nathan is not live right it's just

6580.84 --> 6586.159000000001
premiering

6582.239 --> 6586.159
i guess i could talk about it for a bit

6586.639 --> 6590.8
ah thank you burton fat till my stomach

6589.36 --> 6592.239
is as flat as the earth for the five

6590.8 --> 6596.4800000000005
pound super chat donation

6592.239 --> 6598.799999999999
something for me that's nice

6596.48 --> 6599.5199999999995
but yeah when it comes to my flat earth

6598.8 --> 6603.28
awakening

6599.52 --> 6606.719
it's it's really complicated

6603.28 --> 6610.08
because it was basically i've been like

6606.719 --> 6614.4
in and out my mind has gone through

6610.08 --> 6614.4
a lot of weirdness because of it

6618.8 --> 6623.679
it must have been extremely weird even

6620.88 --> 6626.8
like to my parents

6623.679 --> 6630.88
that i started out kind of

6626.8 --> 6632.639
like knowing the earth was flat in a way

6630.88 --> 6635.36
and understanding that things are being

6632.639 --> 6635.36
fooled around

6636.08 --> 6640.32
but then i fell in love with outer space

6639.36 --> 6642.88
and sci-fi

6640.32 --> 6645.92
and the idea of it all that we could

6642.88 --> 6645.92
develop that way

6646.32 --> 6655.199
as a world society and then i forgot

6650.32 --> 6658.08
about it and i wanted to forget about it

6655.199 --> 6660.159
and then at times i'd been like

6658.08 --> 6663.84
rekindled to it like

6660.159 --> 6667.679
reminded like yeah but

6663.84 --> 6670.719
moon landing didn't really happen

6667.679 --> 6674.08
look at how fake this is

6670.719 --> 6677.119
and like ancient mythology and lores and

6674.08 --> 6677.119
ancient maps and

6677.36 --> 6682.48
and then i entertained the idea

6680.48 --> 6686.48
kept it in the back of my mind but kind

6682.48 --> 6686.48
of put it on a lower priority

6686.96 --> 6691.679
because i just was still onto that space

6689.44 --> 6697.5199999999995
and onto the dream of space

6691.679 --> 6703.28
and then only much later in 2000

6697.52 --> 6705.679
11 i think 2010 i like really

6703.28 --> 6708.639
it's like the first time i really like

6705.679 --> 6710.96
on an adult level

6708.639 --> 6713.28
was ready to really dig into it because

6710.96 --> 6716.88
i also was kind of like living

6713.28 --> 6719.5199999999995
on my own at that time

6716.88 --> 6723.1990000000005
so it was very different for me didn't

6719.52 --> 6727.360000000001
have to reflect it off anybody

6723.199 --> 6727.36
so but then

6731.44 --> 6736.08
it's like every time i had somebody to

6733.44 --> 6740.159
share it with

6736.08 --> 6742.5599999999995
they would get into trouble somehow

6740.159 --> 6743.839999999999
the friend that helped me awake to it i

6742.56 --> 6746.0
got to know him also

6743.84 --> 6747.1990000000005
through our mutual interest in alex

6746.0 --> 6750.88
jones

6747.199 --> 6752.879999999999
and he was like into physics a lot and

6750.88 --> 6754.639
figured out a lot of problems with

6752.88 --> 6758.159000000001
physics

6754.639 --> 6759.92
falsehoods and like how astrophysics is

6758.159 --> 6763.598999999999
nonsense and all that

6759.92 --> 6764.56
that was like 2010 11 that i bumped into

6763.599 --> 6767.84
that guy

6764.56 --> 6770.96
we kind of both got into flat earth

6767.84 --> 6774.0
very early but then

6770.96 --> 6774.4
i don't know he got threatened like he

6774.0 --> 6777.84
has

6774.4 --> 6779.598999999999
had an infant child young family and he

6777.84 --> 6781.84
got threatened and then he

6779.599 --> 6783.360000000001
stepped away he literally didn't want to

6781.84 --> 6784.639
talk about it anymore and he said no

6783.36 --> 6786.719
it's a ball

6784.639 --> 6787.76
like yeah ball creationism god it's a

6786.719 --> 6791.44
ball it's like

6787.76 --> 6793.76
everything is true except that it's flat

6791.44 --> 6797.44
really freaky and that freaked me out

6793.76 --> 6797.4400000000005
that made me forget about it

6797.52 --> 6800.8
like i so shocked to see somebody do

6800.159 --> 6802.719
that to

6800.8 --> 6804.8
who you're kind of close and really like

6802.719 --> 6806.4
detach like that

6804.8 --> 6809.84
and at first you were almost like

6806.4 --> 6809.839999999999
telepathically connected

6810.239 --> 6814.879999999999
that it just shocks jars me out of it

6815.199 --> 6822.96
and then eventually even with my ex i

6819.159 --> 6822.96
rediscovered it again

6823.119 --> 6828.799999999999
and then she basically said to me like

6826.639 --> 6829.679
nope i'm not gonna go there i have

6828.8 --> 6833.119000000001
friends which

6829.679 --> 6834.96
are like dependent on the globe

6833.119 --> 6836.719
they will never be able to accept it it

6834.96 --> 6838.719
will destroy my friend's circle that's

6836.719 --> 6840.639
unacceptable

6838.719 --> 6842.639
you're done basically that's what

6840.639 --> 6846.08
happened to me

6842.639 --> 6847.76
indirectly it was so confusing at the

6846.08 --> 6849.92
time that

6847.76 --> 6851.76
i literally just dropped the entire

6849.92 --> 6853.84
thing went back to designing space

6851.76 --> 6854.96
stations and all that [ __ ] like okay i

6853.84 --> 6856.8
failed

6854.96 --> 6858.96
downgrade again try to keep my

6856.8 --> 6863.84
girlfriend and that didn't work out

6858.96 --> 6863.84
stayed for a year didn't work out

6864.239 --> 6869.839999999999
and then 2015 happened

6867.679 --> 6873.1990000000005
completely on my own in a position where

6869.84 --> 6875.92
i felt like totally doomed

6873.199 --> 6879.5199999999995
very scared of the world and everybody

6875.92 --> 6879.52
constantly rejecting me

6880.88 --> 6884.159000000001
for trying to take up that banner take

6883.52 --> 6887.92
up that

6884.159 --> 6887.92
that pure flame of truth

6889.44 --> 6897.119
and yeah it's been oh

6892.719 --> 6897.119
six years now

6898.08 --> 6902.8
and this flame's not going out anymore

6900.239 --> 6904.0
but i do feel sometimes that by doing it

6902.8 --> 6907.84
i've doomed myself

6904.0 --> 6910.48
because but this might be remnant fear

6907.84 --> 6912.400000000001
porn conditioning

6910.48 --> 6914.32
it's kind of what the globe wants you to

6912.4 --> 6916.638999999999
believe like oh because you do this

6914.32 --> 6920.48
you're not gonna connect anymore well

6916.639 --> 6922.639
for me remnants

6920.48 --> 6925.04
because i can interact with people i can

6922.639 --> 6928.4800000000005
keep it to myself i can deal with

6925.04 --> 6933.84
people not being able to deal with it

6928.48 --> 6933.839999999999
it all changed i just grew into it

6935.28 --> 6947.5199999999995
so yeah that kind of sums it up in

6938.88 --> 6951.52
five minutes

6947.52 --> 6951.52
i've been confronted with it so many

6958.84 --> 6961.84
times

6986.84 --> 6989.84
hmm

6992.719 --> 6999.04
right but one of the more funny things

6995.52 --> 7001.84
that i've even realized is because

6999.04 --> 7003.679
i have been exposed to the idea that the

7001.84 --> 7005.1990000000005
earth may be flat and the mechanics and

7003.679 --> 7008.4800000000005
the physics of that

7005.199 --> 7008.48
quite a few times

7008.639 --> 7013.76
the way it unfolds has been so

7011.92 --> 7017.119
persistent

7013.76 --> 7020.2390000000005
so it really even like in 2015

7017.119 --> 7022.4
it was like i opened up this drawer and

7020.239 --> 7024.08
there's like this entire library there

7022.4 --> 7027.36
of stuff that i already knew

7024.08 --> 7028.32
but i forgotten that i knew because i

7027.36 --> 7031.28
had thought and

7028.32 --> 7031.84
a thought about it in like on a higher

7031.28 --> 7035.599
level

7031.84 --> 7037.52
at the time but then [ __ ] happened

7035.599 --> 7039.92
and i just threw it away kind of in a

7037.52 --> 7041.76
depressive fit

7039.92 --> 7044.639
and then forgot about it and that

7041.76 --> 7046.719
happened quite a few times but it's all

7044.639 --> 7049.4400000000005
there

7046.719 --> 7051.84
it's very vivid like every time i really

7049.44 --> 7055.678999999999
thought about it i was like this

7051.84 --> 7055.679
person a cosmogenist

7056.719 --> 7060.88
like i often felt like i'm a wizard i'm

7059.679 --> 7063.84
a cosmogenist that

7060.88 --> 7066.639
arrived on scene too early and there is

7063.84 --> 7066.639
no scene yet

7066.96 --> 7075.359
but now there is

7072.17 --> 7075.359
[Music]

7076.32 --> 7078.639
right

7079.679 --> 7085.599
but also things like drawing maps like

7082.56 --> 7090.4800000000005
drawing maps and designing worlds

7085.599 --> 7090.4800000000005
through maps i've been doing that since

7095.84 --> 7102.639
like since i was 14 or something

7099.76 --> 7103.280000000001
first i like started to just like very

7102.639 --> 7106.08
young

7103.28 --> 7107.5199999999995
game drawings side on view autographic

7106.08 --> 7109.92
view

7107.52 --> 7111.1990000000005
then later it started to divert off into

7109.92 --> 7113.84
more map

7111.199 --> 7114.638999999999
designs and that eventually then found

7113.84 --> 7118.400000000001
its place

7114.639 --> 7122.159000000001
in rpgs like

7118.4 --> 7124.879999999999
tabletop rpgs where their maps are very

7122.159 --> 7124.879999999999
useful there

7127.44 --> 7130.48
but all this time i was always like

7130.0 --> 7133.599
looking

7130.48 --> 7137.199
at it at what i was making like

7133.599 --> 7140.56
is this real candy could this be real

7137.199 --> 7142.5599999999995
and experimenting like with like

7140.56 --> 7144.96
what is the situation is there something

7142.56 --> 7145.52
like unique magical or impossible

7144.96 --> 7149.76
happening

7145.52 --> 7149.76
something surreal on this map

7151.52 --> 7157.84
and even well from that

7154.719 --> 7161.199
original mindset and the engagement

7157.84 --> 7164.32
of thinking about maps like that is what

7161.199 --> 7166.799999999999
has eventually spawned

7164.32 --> 7169.199
my grip on the rectangular looping

7166.8 --> 7172.639
dynamics

7169.199 --> 7175.759999999999
that i've used and put down here

7172.639 --> 7175.76
on this youtube channel

7176.88 --> 7183.04
comes from those early developments

7180.48 --> 7184.959999999999
just thinking about it how could this

7183.04 --> 7188.48
work

7184.96 --> 7188.4800000000005
how could it be interconnected

7189.36 --> 7194.32
also partially inspired by the idea of

7196.84 --> 7199.84
wormholes

7207.44 --> 7227.839999999999
is there anybody out there it's my chat

7210.8 --> 7227.84
just died or something

7229.92 --> 7241.84
maps are the symbols of their dime

7232.639 --> 7241.84
downfall what do you mean

7242.59 --> 7255.84
[Music]

7244.96 --> 7255.84
hello old horse radborn

7268.88 --> 7272.32
so you kept coming back to it like

7271.04 --> 7275.76
bouncy ball

7272.32 --> 7275.759999999999
gases go boom boom what

7278.56 --> 7283.84
were you addressing

7288.4 --> 7297.839999999999
they got too arrogant with their maps

7291.36 --> 7297.839999999999
what do you mean too arrogant

7316.8 --> 7320.719
that sounds delicious tony whitcomb

7321.599 --> 7325.360000000001
seems like there's some more clouds

7323.28 --> 7326.159
coming over so maybe it might cool up a

7325.36 --> 7329.44
little that's

7326.159 --> 7330.239
that's kind of nice i appreciate the

7329.44 --> 7332.32
heat

7330.239 --> 7339.839999999999
but when it's also this moist it can be

7332.32 --> 7339.84
a little bit of a nuisance

7340.719 --> 7353.84
interesting entry to flat earth what do

7343.44 --> 7353.839999999999
you mean

7359.52 --> 7364.320000000001
all right but yeah old horse radborn

7362.239 --> 7367.759999999999
when it comes to antarctica

7364.32 --> 7370.159
i don't see how that's making it

7367.76 --> 7372.639
arrogant

7370.159 --> 7374.5599999999995
like it's a project the entire thing is

7372.639 --> 7377.28
a project

7374.56 --> 7378.080000000001
and you have to keep in mind we

7377.28 --> 7381.119
literally

7378.08 --> 7383.36
don't know what is beyond

7381.119 --> 7385.199
the north what is beyond the south we

7383.36 --> 7387.5199999999995
don't know

7385.199 --> 7391.199
the projection they did was purely based

7387.52 --> 7391.1990000000005
on the celestial dynamics

7391.44 --> 7398.159
it could be that there isn't more beyond

7395.04 --> 7400.719
but could be there's an entire realm

7398.159 --> 7403.44
north and south that is very similar

7400.719 --> 7406.56
that will continue the cyclical nature

7403.44 --> 7410.0
of the celestial oscillation

7406.56 --> 7412.96
right so that beyond the antiquater

7410.0 --> 7414.96
the arctic and the antarctic lines the

7412.96 --> 7417.76
where the solar minimum is

7414.96 --> 7419.599
that beyond that it will rise again and

7417.76 --> 7422.96
there would be a new

7419.599 --> 7426.159000000001
celestial equator in the other realms

7422.96 --> 7428.4
just like over here that could be the

7426.159 --> 7430.48
case but we don't really know what we do

7428.4 --> 7434.4
know is that the globe projection

7430.48 --> 7434.4
cuts off the north and the south

7434.8 --> 7439.119000000001
at the antiquaters and then wraps it all

7437.92 --> 7442.159
up into

7439.119 --> 7442.159
the ball model

7444.159 --> 7448.0
but we don't know if there really is

7446.639 --> 7449.92
anything beyond there

7448.0 --> 7452.159
for sure we don't know for sure there's

7449.92 --> 7455.599
been stories

7452.159 --> 7457.598999999999
right it's very difficult

7455.599 --> 7461.04
because we don't even fully understand

7457.599 --> 7464.4800000000005
what the actual orientation of it all is

7461.04 --> 7465.5199999999995
right so the disk is it the euclidean

7464.48 --> 7468.4
disc

7465.52 --> 7470.320000000001
with a barrier or is it well a

7468.4 --> 7472.4
rectangular looping setup

7470.32 --> 7475.759999999999
and there is actually no barrier it's

7472.4 --> 7480.0
all literally looping in on itself

7475.76 --> 7482.96
like a material realm stuck in a loop

7480.0 --> 7483.76
like its own self-contained wormhole

7482.96 --> 7488.079
almost

7483.76 --> 7488.079000000001
yeah to get really science fictiony

7488.239 --> 7492.159
so we just don't know and the maps don't

7490.8 --> 7495.76
really reveal that

7492.159 --> 7498.239
but it just seems kind of evident that

7495.76 --> 7501.52
the exact north and south pole point on

7498.239 --> 7504.159
the spherical projected maps

7501.52 --> 7507.84
don't seem to be accurate there's

7504.159 --> 7507.839999999999
something wrong with it

7508.32 --> 7514.32
that's it that's as far as the data

7519.679 --> 7524.88
like we don't even know the actual

7523.04 --> 7528.48
orientation of the

7524.88 --> 7528.4800000000005
antarctic ice wall

7529.04 --> 7533.28
like when you follow it around with a

7531.04 --> 7533.28
ship

7533.36 --> 7541.199
are you gonna end up going 360 degrees

7538.159 --> 7542.4
like on the inside or on the outside or

7541.199 --> 7545.199
will it be weirder

7542.4 --> 7546.4
will it just turn out to be no it's kind

7545.199 --> 7548.638999999999
of like a straight

7546.4 --> 7550.96
line with maybe edges and all that but

7548.639 --> 7552.079
it will end up in exactly euclidean

7550.96 --> 7555.28
straight line

7552.079 --> 7558.5599999999995
right we don't even know

7555.28 --> 7563.84
this for sure we don't know

7558.56 --> 7563.84
we don't know it's not openly revealed

7564.0 --> 7567.44
and you don't know if there isn't any

7565.84 --> 7570.639
ice wall ellen

7567.44 --> 7570.638999999999
you don't know that either

7572.239 --> 7581.28
antarctica is an ice wall

7577.599 --> 7581.28
it's a wall of ice

7582.32 --> 7585.199
a lot of it is

7588.88 --> 7592.96
but we don't know if it's a ice

7591.76 --> 7596.719
surrounding us

7592.96 --> 7598.4800000000005
or like an island or if it's literally a

7596.719 --> 7601.04
straight wall

7598.48 --> 7605.839999999999
or somewhere in between any of all that

7601.04 --> 7605.84
we don't know this for sure

7614.719 --> 7618.719
oh well alan i'm glad that you know that

7617.92 --> 7621.679
with such

7618.719 --> 7624.159
certainty well just take your word for

7621.679 --> 7624.159
it right

7627.28 --> 7633.84
because you've been there recently and

7630.4 --> 7633.839999999999
there was no wall there right

7644.84 --> 7647.84
sure

7653.52 --> 7675.84
oh really how do you know

7661.52 --> 7675.84
how did you attain that knowledge ellen

7715.28 --> 7721.119
oh come on ellen seem to be so certain

7719.52 --> 7724.4800000000005
of yourself of your knowledge

7721.119 --> 7728.639
well how did you attain it how do you

7724.48 --> 7728.638999999999
know there is no ice wall in antarctica

7728.84 --> 7731.84
ellen

7741.92 --> 7746.079
right yes tony whitcomb that's uh robert

7744.32 --> 7748.4
shortman

7746.079 --> 7750.4
did you know that i did my second show

7748.4 --> 7752.638999999999
on this channel my second live show with

7750.4 --> 7752.638999999999
him

7753.679 --> 7757.1990000000005
it's it's like the fl yeah pre-flattered

7756.48 --> 7761.119
talks or

7757.199 --> 7765.119
his flatter talks let me share that

7761.119 --> 7765.119
let me actually find that link for you

7765.52 --> 7769.679
very proud of that he's a cool guy

7770.84 --> 7773.84
okay

7786.0 --> 7789.28
right it was with martin litke and with

7788.079 --> 7792.239
robert shortman

7789.28 --> 7793.679
where are we and then later i headed

7792.239 --> 7801.839999999999
back on track

7793.679 --> 7801.84
that was good too

7802.239 --> 7807.598999999999
it only has 200 views that's so cute

7812.239 --> 7817.28
yeah 47 minute stream i'll link it up

7817.76 --> 7822.2390000000005
this is from my channel from four years

7819.92 --> 7822.2390000000005
ago

7822.639 --> 7829.84
that's robert shortman

7840.84 --> 7843.84
ugh

7853.76 --> 7859.92
it seems like alan siraniak

7857.44 --> 7862.32
didn't have any comeback when he asked

7859.92 --> 7865.36
her how did she know

7862.32 --> 7870.32
antarctica did not have a nice wall

7865.36 --> 7885.839999999999
oh well i guess she realized that she

7870.32 --> 7885.84
didn't really know

7901.84 --> 7908.2390000000005
you can travel across north pole

7905.119 --> 7912.719
no professor fill bell what you do is

7908.239 --> 7915.919999999999
you go in an ark

7912.719 --> 7915.92
around canada

7916.159 --> 7919.759999999999
and then you end up in antarctica

7918.8 --> 7922.8
because it's pretty much

7919.76 --> 7925.84
right next to it yeah we know

7922.8 --> 7926.8
that's not going over and that's not

7925.84 --> 7928.96
going over

7926.8 --> 7930.159000000001
the north pole right that's not

7928.96 --> 7933.199
literally like oh

7930.159 --> 7936.48
going north and then

7933.199 --> 7941.839999999999
oh right you end up in a straight line

7936.48 --> 7941.839999999999
right there at greenland no

7948.96 --> 7957.04
okay gorilla cough me all chinese man we

7954.159 --> 7957.04
all come forward

7958.079 --> 7963.44
i did taekwondo but that's actually

7960.88 --> 7963.4400000000005
korean

7964.239 --> 7969.839999999999
and i do have a bit of an old chinese

7966.32 --> 7969.84
man mustache i have to agree

7971.599 --> 7975.84
and i actually do have some chinese

7973.76 --> 7979.280000000001
genetics it's just not that much

7975.84 --> 7979.28
like a 16th or something

7980.56 --> 7984.4800000000005
so i'm not really offended by that

7988.24 --> 7991.33
[Music]

7994.84 --> 8002.34
statement

7997.16 --> 8002.34
[Music]

8015.28 --> 8025.84
antarctica yeah that's why i said the

8018.079 --> 8025.84
north pole

8039.44 --> 8042.638999999999
it's it's kind of tough because

8041.52 --> 8045.679
antarctica

8042.639 --> 8047.1990000000005
is an actual continent there's there's

8045.679 --> 8050.4
land

8047.199 --> 8052.32
higher than sea level there north pole

8050.4 --> 8054.879999999999
doesn't have that it just has a bunch of

8052.32 --> 8054.88
ice cap

8057.679 --> 8067.84
well for as far as the the glow

8060.639 --> 8067.84
projection reveals that is

8077.04 --> 8080.639
it's just that in my mind it's like oh

8078.639 --> 8081.679
antarctica and then the other side is

8080.639 --> 8083.92
arctica but

8081.679 --> 8087.119
then yeah it's not actually a continent

8083.92 --> 8089.76
so it's just the north pole

8087.119 --> 8090.239
i find that a little annoying sometimes

8089.76 --> 8095.599
but

8090.239 --> 8100.32
well who cares

8095.599 --> 8100.32
yeah that truck is reversing it's

8110.0 --> 8116.719
ah so ellen

8114.159 --> 8118.48
you never really responded to how you

8116.719 --> 8122.32
knew

8118.48 --> 8124.079
antarctica is not a wall of ice that it

8122.32 --> 8125.04
has no ice wall you never came back to

8124.079 --> 8127.04
me but now you

8125.04 --> 8130.56
seem to be very certain that nathan

8127.04 --> 8130.56
doesn't understand something

8132.32 --> 8136.88
sounds like you came here specifically

8134.88 --> 8140.2390000000005
to get banned

8136.88 --> 8140.2390000000005
am i anywhere close

8142.719 --> 8147.04
right because you don't really get to

8145.599 --> 8149.1990000000005
put down another

8147.04 --> 8151.119
some kind of question especially if it's

8149.199 --> 8153.44
at home

8151.119 --> 8154.48
related in some way you don't put down

8153.44 --> 8157.36
another question

8154.48 --> 8157.839999999999
after you ignored answering a pretty

8157.36 --> 8161.759999999999
open

8157.84 --> 8179.84
question that was addressed to you

8161.76 --> 8179.84
helen sireniak

8208.16 --> 8214.399
yeah maybe ellen just put me on mute

8211.76 --> 8216.399
right so ellen can i have a a check are

8214.399 --> 8218.479
you actually listening

8216.399 --> 8219.519
to what i'm saying right now if you do

8218.479 --> 8223.679
then

8219.519 --> 8235.84
spell out my name in a reply

8223.679 --> 8235.84
right you have a minute

8248.0 --> 8253.04
do not show it what

8253.439 --> 8256.639000000001
that makes no sense

8259.12 --> 8263.76
right not just testing just testing but

8261.519 --> 8266.0
what you said makes absolutely no sense

8263.76 --> 8266.399
because the topographical maps don't

8266.0 --> 8270.88
show

8266.399 --> 8274.0
an ice wall maybe

8270.88 --> 8277.039999999999
it's because it grows and

8274.0 --> 8279.28
shrinks and grows and shrinks

8277.04 --> 8280.479000000001
right i'm pretty sure there are maps

8279.28 --> 8283.679
that do actually

8280.479 --> 8286.8
show ice it's like

8283.679 --> 8288.8
okay this year's ice map that year's ice

8286.8 --> 8289.199999999999
map and just to see to keep track of

8288.8 --> 8292.88
like

8289.2 --> 8296.880000000001
is it is there a continuing pattern of

8292.88 --> 8298.8
growing or growing smaller

8296.88 --> 8302.08
right they do keep track of it it's just

8298.8 --> 8306.8
not the most typical map that they would

8302.08 --> 8306.8
give to show you earth

8307.76 --> 8315.92
look it's another type of map

8313.04 --> 8317.04
they care more on what is on on land

8315.92 --> 8320.08
features of the land

8317.04 --> 8322.0
not the watery or ice

8320.08 --> 8325.36
the ice on top of it all the water of

8322.0 --> 8328.54
course they do with lakes and all that

8325.36 --> 8328.54
[Music]

8330.16 --> 8349.519
there is ice no ice wool so

8346.719 --> 8351.759999999998
what about all the footage then of

8349.519 --> 8354.960000000001
really big ice walls

8351.76 --> 8355.439
how about those are you saying that's

8354.96 --> 8358.839999999998
fake

8355.439 --> 8361.84
even though it was actually moving video

8358.84 --> 8361.84
footage

8363.76 --> 8367.12
yeah i do know there are shores in

8365.439 --> 8369.599
beaches in antarctica

8367.12 --> 8371.28
but that's because that specific little

8369.599 --> 8374.639000000001
region

8371.28 --> 8379.359
right next to argentina

8374.639 --> 8382.319
right that's a protrusion it's a piece

8379.359 --> 8382.880000000001
it's further north right it's not really

8382.319 --> 8386.8
like

8382.88 --> 8388.559
the mainland thing it's a little

8386.8 --> 8391.358999999999
further north than the rest of

8388.559 --> 8391.358999999999
antarctica

8397.76 --> 8403.439
but hey still that region does freeze up

8401.2 --> 8405.439
the ocean does freeze up there's just

8403.439 --> 8417.84
not a giant ice wall

8405.439 --> 8417.84
that like never melts

8426.319 --> 8430.08
why isn't antarctica on the u.n maps

8429.28 --> 8445.84
because of the

8430.08 --> 8445.84
method of projection old hoss

8485.2 --> 8487.84
huh

8488.8 --> 8492.8
that's a really weird idea there old

8491.6 --> 8495.6
horse

8492.8 --> 8498.24
antarctica the size of hawaii i think we

8495.6 --> 8501.84
would definitely know the difference

8498.24 --> 8501.84
if it was

8508.0 --> 8515.28
ellen don't go there he does

8511.2 --> 8529.84
understand diffraction and i do too

8515.28 --> 8529.84
don't play those games

8533.2 --> 8536.720000000001
i want to see diffraction

8537.04 --> 8543.84
i'll show my diagram

8554.84 --> 8557.84
uh

8560.24 --> 8571.84
there you go

8576.96 --> 8581.919999999998
he has to google it dude shut the [ __ ]

8582.84 --> 8585.84
up

8588.72 --> 8592.319
i'm not googling it i'm literally

8591.2 --> 8595.52
showing you

8592.319 --> 8599.039999999999
my diagram right

8595.52 --> 8603.28
diffraction is the inability to resolve

8599.04 --> 8607.439
the angle within sight

8603.28 --> 8607.439
so when you look over a flat surface

8608.0 --> 8612.56
the closer you are to that flat surface

8610.72 --> 8615.599999999999
looking over it

8612.56 --> 8618.72
at some point you will stop

8615.6 --> 8620.880000000001
seeing things

8618.72 --> 8622.96
right next to that flat surface over

8620.88 --> 8627.839999999998
distance they will become concealed

8622.96 --> 8627.839999999998
bottom up

8628.16 --> 8631.439
that's not direction oh what did you

8630.88 --> 8633.279999999999
just

8631.439 --> 8635.6
well why don't you [ __ ] define it

8633.28 --> 8641.84
then [ __ ]

8635.6 --> 8641.84
why don't you define it then come on

8646.74 --> 8651.149
[Music]

8659.04 --> 8664.0
that is really criterion yeah that's

8660.96 --> 8666.88
directly involved in it

8664.0 --> 8668.72
so you put it down what it is right now

8666.88 --> 8672.08
or you're [ __ ] banned

8668.72 --> 8676.56
nobody gets to talk like that in my chat

8672.08 --> 8680.88
and not immediately inform us

8676.56 --> 8683.439
immediately no hesitation no

8680.88 --> 8684.56
swirling around it you made that claim

8683.439 --> 8688.24
we don't understand

8684.56 --> 8691.76
you put it down immediately in text

8688.24 --> 8692.64
full no [ __ ] copy paste [ __ ] you

8691.76 --> 8694.399
put it down

8692.64 --> 8696.64
immediately according to your

8694.399 --> 8699.76
understanding or you're banned

8696.64 --> 8701.519999999999
right you got [ __ ] 30 seconds both of

8699.76 --> 8705.04
you

8701.52 --> 8705.04
5 and 20 and ellen

8705.2 --> 8713.04
30 seconds put it down immediately

8709.2 --> 8725.84
what is diffraction then fully defined

8713.04 --> 8725.84
immediately 20 seconds

8727.12 --> 8732.800000000001
ten nine oh you're you're gone

8730.24 --> 8732.8
immediately

8736.84 --> 8741.84
ellen

8738.319 --> 8743.6
fraction tendency of light is spread out

8741.84 --> 8746.880000000001
when encountering an obstacle

8743.6 --> 8750.56
right nice

8746.88 --> 8752.72
that's actually a definition

8750.56 --> 8753.92
that's a description of that effect the

8752.72 --> 8757.039999999999
fraction of light

8753.92 --> 8761.12
moving past the surface right so

8757.04 --> 8761.12
if you look past a flat surface

8761.359 --> 8767.84
it's gonna diffract the light isn't it

8764.96 --> 8770.0
it's gonna do that well that's directly

8767.84 --> 8773.6
associated with the bottom-up

8770.0 --> 8777.52
obstruction hey are you banned ellen

8773.6 --> 8783.04
are you banned right now do you see me

8777.52 --> 8783.04
banning you or is your text still there

8783.92 --> 8789.12
right yeah but you're correct but that's

8786.0 --> 8792.24
because you basically described

8789.12 --> 8795.28
the effect that is directly responsible

8792.24 --> 8798.24
for what i describe

8795.28 --> 8800.319000000001
bottom up concealment even when you look

8798.24 --> 8804.16
out for a flat surface right so i

8800.319 --> 8806.72
absolutely describe the process

8804.16 --> 8807.52
from a non-understanding viewpoint so

8806.72 --> 8810.319
literally

8807.52 --> 8811.76
everybody in the [ __ ] world has a

8810.319 --> 8814.479
basic imagination

8811.76 --> 8816.800000000001
can understand what i mean without like

8814.479 --> 8818.96
oh mechanical i have to be special boy i

8816.8 --> 8823.119999999999
have to be the physics

8818.96 --> 8826.08
right no i just described the effect

8823.12 --> 8828.800000000001
right it is called diffraction but i

8826.08 --> 8833.52
just describe it

8828.8 --> 8833.519999999999
a delay a delay is there

8834.72 --> 8837.84
what delay

8838.399 --> 8843.84
you better not be talking about the

8839.92 --> 8843.84
delay in light because that's [ __ ]

8846.0 --> 8851.2
maybe you mean the delay and when you're

8848.08 --> 8854.88
going to receive the footage

8851.2 --> 8854.880000000001
did not describe the process

8856.0 --> 8861.68
yeah i did yeah i did

8859.359 --> 8865.12
and i've even showed the diagram that i

8861.68 --> 8867.439
have made like years ago

8865.12 --> 8868.479000000001
bottom up concealment looking over a

8867.439 --> 8871.6
flat surface

8868.479 --> 8875.279999999999
right well that's because of diffraction

8871.6 --> 8876.960000000001
it bends the light when it touches

8875.28 --> 8880.960000000001
something

8876.96 --> 8884.319
right that's the thing

8880.96 --> 8886.72
the fraction also the cost for the

8884.319 --> 8888.08
for the wave function of light when

8886.72 --> 8891.438999999998
going through slits

8888.08 --> 8894.8
it's the same effect light goes

8891.439 --> 8898.0
past the surface it there's a cascade

8894.8 --> 8899.679999999998
thing happening it's weird it deflects

8898.0 --> 8901.84
right well that's the same thing that

8899.68 --> 8904.399
happens

8901.84 --> 8906.56
out there when you look very far away

8904.399 --> 8908.0
over a flat surface the flat surface we

8906.56 --> 8910.72
know as earth

8908.0 --> 8911.84
things will start to disappear bottom up

8910.72 --> 8914.08
into the distance

8911.84 --> 8915.92
if their angular size is big enough for

8914.08 --> 8917.28
you to even pick up at that all that

8915.92 --> 8920.72
distance

8917.28 --> 8924.479000000001
that's what happens and you can

8920.72 --> 8927.199999999999
yeah yeah explain that also through

8924.479 --> 8927.199999999999
diffraction

8928.08 --> 8935.84
it's part of the optical process that's

8930.0 --> 8935.84
going on

8944.16 --> 8951.359
you mean wave functions wave

8948.16 --> 8953.92
function function not actual wave

8951.359 --> 8955.84
it's a function it's a wave function not

8953.92 --> 8959.28
a actual wave

8955.84 --> 8959.28
right light is not a wave

8961.28 --> 8966.24
no old horse it's not a bot it's

8963.2 --> 8966.240000000002
probably brenda

8966.64 --> 8970.16
brenda is a bot there's people out there

8969.84 --> 8974.84
that

8970.16 --> 8977.84
are living bots they are really like

8974.84 --> 8977.84
that

8983.2 --> 8988.16
that could never happen oh oh really

8986.319 --> 8989.359
well what about all the demonstration

8988.16 --> 8992.479
where it does

8989.359 --> 8994.08
happen unconfirmed measured flat

8992.479 --> 8996.56
surfaces confirmed

8994.08 --> 8998.24
measured like in every conceivable way

8996.56 --> 9002.319
confirmed measured flat

8998.24 --> 9005.52
oh you put a camera right next to

9002.319 --> 9007.359
the surface you put an object you move

9005.52 --> 9010.640000000001
it away into the distance

9007.359 --> 9011.04
oh and very far away suddenly you don't

9010.64 --> 9014.72
see

9011.04 --> 9017.52
it anymore the bottom of it disappears

9014.72 --> 9018.319
confirm measured flat surfaces yeah it

9017.52 --> 9021.28
can work

9018.319 --> 9022.96
it absolutely works on a flat earth on a

9021.28 --> 9025.76
flat surface

9022.96 --> 9027.519999999999
confirmed measured flat yeah doesn't

9025.76 --> 9029.04
even have to be the earth it can be an

9027.52 --> 9032.399000000001
object it can be a table

9029.04 --> 9036.720000000001
it happens it's optics eyes

9032.399 --> 9039.519999999999
seeing inherent it absolutely does work

9036.72 --> 9039.519999999999
on a flat earth

9045.52 --> 9049.84
light is also particle now lights is

9048.479 --> 9053.039999999999
beams

9049.84 --> 9056.24
light is infinitely divisible

9053.04 --> 9059.04
