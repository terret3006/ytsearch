200.22 --> 207.35999999999999
don't have any specific subjects in mind

204.12 --> 211.159
at hand on the mind

207.36 --> 211.15900000000002
was watching om Benjamin

211.5 --> 215.599
stream from I think from yesterday

219.84 --> 224.22
it seemed kind of incomplete I think he

221.64 --> 226.64
was having some issues getting grappled

224.22 --> 226.64
because

226.98 --> 232.319
the end was basically just cut off I

229.86 --> 234.36
don't know it was still good gravy

232.319 --> 236.76
overall

234.36 --> 239.93900000000002
uh

236.76 --> 241.56
right also set through made by Jim Bob

239.939 --> 243.48

241.56 --> 246.72
talking

243.48 --> 251.11999999999998
more Spirit mechanics and psychology

246.72 --> 251.12

254.819 --> 259.919
Mitchell also went live actually did

257.579 --> 262.1
watch it back but it

259.919 --> 265.62
keeps on missing

262.1 --> 268.04
sorry Mitchell I do really appreciate

265.62 --> 268.04
your Channel

269.04 --> 275.24
uh

271.44 --> 275.24
all right anything else

276.54 --> 282.78000000000003
yeah yesterday's Flat Earth debate was

279.979 --> 283.5
like super long and it was live all the

282.78 --> 286.38
way

283.5 --> 288.479
so it was a

286.38 --> 291.62
three hour I think three and a half or

288.479 --> 291.62
three hour live show

291.72 --> 300.36
oh live and like basically nailing one

295.74 --> 303.66
single guy who just refused to give up

300.36 --> 306.3
it was like he had rumpus level

303.66 --> 308.759
persistence

306.3 --> 312.78000000000003
and yeah the the panel could barely get

308.759 --> 314.94
a word in that's a snarling from Nathan

312.78 --> 317.34
over our interruptions

314.94 --> 320.12
but yeah it was a pretty heavy Flat

317.34 --> 320.11999999999995
Earth debate yesterday

326.16 --> 332.22
Spanish High Court confirms covid-19

329.24 --> 334.68
doesn't exist really

332.22 --> 337.91900000000004
okay

334.68 --> 340.58
oh I'd say I'd agree

337.919 --> 340.58
uh

345.3 --> 351.479
I watched that video of which is getting

349.259 --> 355.52000000000004
okay I tried to watch it but I couldn't

351.479 --> 355.52
find the moment it's just that

355.8 --> 361.34000000000003
I thought the atmosphere in that entire

357.96 --> 361.34
video was very annoying

362.699 --> 366.84000000000003
but you did watch it and he did actually

364.74 --> 371.06
get attacked

366.84 --> 371.06
with a baseball bat no less that's crazy

372.96 --> 378.73999999999995
hello classical homeopath

375.78 --> 378.73999999999995
good to see you

381.66 --> 387.90000000000003
right at the beginning

384.539 --> 389.699
I don't how can I have missed that

387.9 --> 392.59999999999997
so weird

389.699 --> 392.6
okay let me

393.539 --> 396.68
try to find it

417.3 --> 420.5
I said this one

422.16 --> 424.819
no

433.139 --> 437.419
oh wait Salt Lake City wasn't it

438.0 --> 441.84
yeah that's the one

440.28 --> 444.44
right so all the way at the beginning

441.84 --> 444.44
you say

453.06 --> 455.84
three minutes

456.419 --> 459.19899999999996
all right

474.9 --> 479.84
all right that's when he starts walking

477.18 --> 479.84000000000003
in the group

499.08 --> 503.599
three and a half minutes and I'm still

500.879 --> 503.59900000000005
not seeing it

513.419 --> 516.919
APG crew Shank

537.36 --> 542.04

540.0 --> 545.399

Jesus

580.019 --> 584.339
all right

581.58 --> 586.74
yeah I for some reason managed to skip

584.339 --> 588.0
right over that every single time I

586.74 --> 590.339
flick through it

588.0 --> 593.899
anyway thank you for pointing that out

590.339 --> 593.899
slow my moon buggy

596.519 --> 603.62
wow back got my shut up man

600.66 --> 603.62

662.7 --> 665.1800000000001

693.18 --> 699.26
by the way

695.1 --> 699.26
huh no it's not full

699.54 --> 705.3199999999999
it's a very clear sky though over there

701.519 --> 705.32
in that video anyway

716.339 --> 722.94
never seen a Fundy explode so much

720.48 --> 724.139
oh I don't yeah I put it on mute so I

722.94 --> 728.2790000000001
don't know what they were actually

724.139 --> 730.0790000000001
talking about when she came after him

728.279 --> 733.32
with the bat

730.079 --> 737.06
sharp Crescent room two days ago okay

733.32 --> 737.0600000000001

it's awesome

773.339 --> 779.1600000000001
yeah I think I'm pretty much covered for

776.519 --> 781.7
the next week now

779.16 --> 781.6999999999999
it's awesome

782.22 --> 786.48
like in combination with the paypals

785.16 --> 788.2199999999999
yesterday

786.48 --> 789.899
it's great

788.22 --> 792.6
she

789.899 --> 795.079
went get out of here this is my church

792.6 --> 795.0790000000001
okay

800.579 --> 809.2199999999999
was she quoting faithless or something

805.019 --> 811.8
this is my church of atheist idiots

809.22 --> 814.88
we get triggered over anything not

811.8 --> 814.88
atheist or whatever

816.54 --> 820.62
yes anyway thanks PJ cruyshank really

819.18 --> 823.76
appreciate that

820.62 --> 823.76
so yeah I'm

830.1 --> 835.139
I'm open for

832.56 --> 837.56
or yeah open to talk about whatever you

835.139 --> 837.5600000000001
guys like

844.74 --> 847.279
huh

849.12 --> 854.399
except for nonsense rumors about oh flat

852.42 --> 857.639
earthers in secret Communications

854.399 --> 860.04
admitting to presupposed Glow proofs

857.639 --> 863.399
right that's type of nonsense that I'm

860.04 --> 867.24
not going to get into it's so weak

863.399 --> 871.399
it is really really weak

867.24 --> 874.82
to actually believe that people that are

871.399 --> 878.339
effectively Champions here in this

874.82 --> 883.639
philosophical struggle

878.339 --> 883.639
that we are secretly actually globers no

888.36 --> 892.32
I mean if somebody would say that about

890.699 --> 895.68
me

892.32 --> 899.88
I I wouldn't blame them

895.68 --> 902.04
because I do kind of like I have my ball

899.88 --> 905.579
win act and all that

902.04 --> 908.16
and in a way yeah maybe I am secretly

905.579 --> 910.1389999999999
Global it's just that it doesn't really

908.16 --> 913.26
matter anymore because I know the Earth

910.139 --> 916.5790000000001
is not gonna turn out to be a glow

913.26 --> 916.579
but one can dream

917.04 --> 920.899
and that's really what keeps it going

921.54 --> 926.9399999999999
but yeah so when it comes to Riley and

924.66 --> 929.699
Nathan absolutely not

926.94 --> 932.4590000000001
like they can barely accept

929.699 --> 934.68
that maybe the globe

932.459 --> 936.779
dog that there's a place for globe

934.68 --> 938.9399999999999
Doctrine right

936.779 --> 941.759
in The Wider scheme of things

938.94 --> 943.98
so they are not secretly turning out to

941.759 --> 948.86
be flat or to be turning out to be

943.98 --> 948.86
globers that's the absolutely not

950.04 --> 955.199
uh

952.019 --> 957.86
that's a real desperate bid to suggest

955.199 --> 957.8599999999999
such things

966.06 --> 970.0999999999999
it's like where did you even get that

979.38 --> 982.22
um right

991.25 --> 997.559
[Music]

1024.74 --> 1027.1
hmm

1031.64 --> 1036.919
okay this this might be interesting

1034.76 --> 1041.36
it's just popped

1036.919 --> 1043.88
I was just browsing RT this popped up

1041.36 --> 1045.86
I'm not advertising I'm just saying like

1043.88 --> 1047.6000000000001
hey this is

1045.86 --> 1050.78
another

1047.6 --> 1055.039
development might become relevant might

1050.78 --> 1056.8999999999999
just stay local to Russia but

1055.039 --> 1058.76
it's good to keep track of these types

1056.9 --> 1060.0800000000002
of developments so apparently there is a

1058.76 --> 1063.32
new

1060.08 --> 1066.02
type of drug or an old drug that they

1063.32 --> 1069.02
are using in very specific

1066.02 --> 1069.02
conditions

1069.38 --> 1073.7600000000002
like in the in the worst of conditions

1071.48 --> 1076.34
when you supposedly have C

1073.76 --> 1079.52
again cytokine storms

1076.34 --> 1081.76
so yeah don't know if that is legitimate

1079.52 --> 1081.76
but

1082.28 --> 1085.4189999999999
very well could be

1097.88 --> 1103.16
so yeah it might be something very

1101.0 --> 1105.86
similar like

1103.16 --> 1109.1000000000001
like for example I

1105.86 --> 1112.4189999999999
the horse dewormer this could be another

1109.1 --> 1112.4189999999999
one of those so

1113.539 --> 1118.16
interesting

1115.64 --> 1121.3600000000001
that literally just popped

1118.16 --> 1121.3600000000001
on my screen here

1121.46 --> 1124.3600000000001
uh

1147.86 --> 1152.08
all right let's see what you guys are

1149.66 --> 1152.0800000000002
talking about

1153.86 --> 1157.4189999999999
hey seeking style water

1162.679 --> 1168.5
what we all pretend to be flat earthers

1165.86 --> 1171.28
because of all the social perks oh

1168.5 --> 1171.28
right

1171.919 --> 1177.0200000000002
well maybe the globers think that there

1174.44 --> 1179.6000000000001
is like a secret society that opens up

1177.02 --> 1182.179
to you if you become a flat earther

1179.6 --> 1183.74
and they have absolutely no idea what

1182.179 --> 1186.14
that could be

1183.74 --> 1188.66
so

1186.14 --> 1190.64
right we must be doing it because it's

1188.66 --> 1192.74
worth it even though the Earth is a

1190.64 --> 1194.24
globe according to them

1192.74 --> 1197.24
so

1194.24 --> 1199.22
yeah the standard social perks are

1197.24 --> 1202.419
definitely not good there's more like a

1199.22 --> 1205.88
sacrifice but there must be something

1202.419 --> 1209.14
Beyond to make it worth it that we keep

1205.88 --> 1209.14
holding on to Flat Earth

1210.679 --> 1214.4
how's life been treating you recently

1212.6 --> 1217.539
great

1214.4 --> 1217.539
really good actually

1226.28 --> 1229.72
media muncher

1232.76 --> 1236.2
Flat Earth Country Club

1236.84 --> 1239.4399999999998
uh

1241.28 --> 1247.3999999999999
that's the secret flatterer Society

1244.52 --> 1249.08
oh oh that's hilarious it's not the

1247.4 --> 1252.1000000000001
flatter Society it's the Flat Earth

1249.08 --> 1252.1
secret society

1254.059 --> 1258.58
it that's not really a secret at all

1287.2 --> 1291.02
right that's it that's funny you say

1289.7 --> 1293.3600000000001
that by the way

1291.02 --> 1295.1589999999999
territory six

1293.36 --> 1298.58
are you serious there might be a time

1295.159 --> 1300.44
where there will like it when it will be

1298.58 --> 1303.26
like

1300.44 --> 1306.98
sort of commercially promoted to be

1303.26 --> 1309.98
flattered you think so really

1306.98 --> 1309.98
what

1313.1 --> 1317.9599999999998
I think if that happens it will just

1315.32 --> 1320.12
become a giant mess

1317.96 --> 1321.98
it's just gonna convolute

1320.12 --> 1324.4399999999998
everything even more if there's like

1321.98 --> 1326.72
incentives other than to really be

1324.44 --> 1330.14
correct

1326.72 --> 1332.84
it's just gonna get sloppier

1330.14 --> 1336.14
lots of people were just blabbering

1332.84 --> 1338.62
trying to be like flat earthers

1336.14 --> 1338.6200000000001
weird

1344.12 --> 1349.059
every Club is a heavy Club no

1355.4 --> 1362.919
but every Club is on an Fe

1359.059 --> 1362.9189999999999
doesn't make it an Fe Club

1363.2 --> 1368.419
I know what you mean

1365.24 --> 1373.0
right like all maps are flat Earth maps

1368.419 --> 1373.0
because the Earth is flat yay

1374.72 --> 1378.44
none of it to scale even though Google

1376.64 --> 1380.7800000000002
has corrected

1378.44 --> 1382.1200000000001
that corrected

1380.78 --> 1385.72
basically

1382.12 --> 1385.7199999999998
stopped showing it

1386.36 --> 1389.8999999999999
with their models you don't you no

1388.4 --> 1393.0800000000002
longer see the

1389.9 --> 1397.1200000000001
the scale differences now

1393.08 --> 1397.12
even though it was there before

1399.039 --> 1403.419
Armenian units on their way what

1407.96 --> 1412.7
you mean apparent distances

1411.44 --> 1415.48
oh

1412.7 --> 1415.48
look at that

1416.419 --> 1423.8200000000002
I mean there could be a rainbow out here

1419.539 --> 1423.82
at some point perhaps wow look at

1424.1 --> 1429.58
good look at how those clouds look

1426.86 --> 1429.58
that's just

1431.84 --> 1434.74
interesting

1440.24 --> 1444.34
that's that's some classical series

1445.179 --> 1450.26
I don't know how to pronounce it in

1447.799 --> 1453.74
English but it's like the high

1450.26 --> 1456.02
feathery clouds that do typically

1453.74 --> 1458.059
associate like when those types of cloud

1456.02 --> 1460.34
meet with nimbers

1458.059 --> 1464.36
this is like what I learned with me

1460.34 --> 1467.6
basic meteorology like 30 years ago

1464.36 --> 1470.1789999999999
supposedly these types of clouds meet

1467.6 --> 1472.4599999999998
a nimbus cloud

1470.179 --> 1476.9
or cumulus cloud

1472.46 --> 1479.919
then it becomes a cumulus nimbus

1476.9 --> 1482.539
becomes heavy with rain so yeah that

1479.919 --> 1484.22
definitely explains why it has been

1482.539 --> 1486.32
raining a plenty

1484.22 --> 1490.299
and there are

1486.32 --> 1490.299
cumulus clouds big

1490.48 --> 1496.24
non-transparent Cloud Banks rolling

1493.039 --> 1496.24
around in between so

1498.32 --> 1503.1399999999999
so distinctly blue in between on it

1503.24 --> 1506.14
fascinating

1514.039 --> 1517.82
what

1516.14 --> 1521.5
there

1517.82 --> 1521.5
PP PayPal what

1521.84 --> 1524.5
oh

1524.6 --> 1531.62
all right I'll check it

1528.159 --> 1534.1000000000001
PayPal is Our Winning units now that's

1531.62 --> 1534.1
hilarious

1539.96 --> 1544.059
oh wow you guys

1544.1 --> 1547.24
thank you so much

1561.919 --> 1566.6200000000001
that's awesome thank you so much Tony

1563.96 --> 1566.6200000000001
Whitcomb

1567.08 --> 1574.299
and PJ crew shank earlier I really

1570.44 --> 1574.299
appreciate you guys supporting me

1576.26 --> 1579.1589999999999
it's a big relief

1587.659 --> 1592.94
[ __ ] you and have a great day what

1599.779 --> 1605.9
I on the prize not at the clouds

1603.5 --> 1608.72
I'm sorry dude

1605.9 --> 1611.0800000000002
it just looked so beautiful so bright

1608.72 --> 1611.08
and blue

1615.5 --> 1621.2
then I was looking for a rainbow

1618.5 --> 1622.58
after you mention Armenian units because

1621.2 --> 1625.48
that's what they've kind of been

1622.58 --> 1625.48
designated to

1626.96 --> 1632.059
to be involved with

1629.12 --> 1633.26
one are we in unit distance to the

1632.059 --> 1636.1399999999999
rainbow

1633.26 --> 1638.539
to Armenian units distance to the Moon

1636.14 --> 1640.8990000000001
and three are winning units distance to

1638.539 --> 1640.899
the Sun

1654.679 --> 1657.3990000000001
all right

1663.75 --> 1668.559
[Music]

1666.38 --> 1668.5590000000002
foreign

1671.5 --> 1677.059
yeah by the way

1674.6 --> 1679.039
I'm starting to run on a tobacco I have

1677.059 --> 1680.96
to like reorder it and I'm probably

1679.039 --> 1682.64
gonna be waiting on it for a long time

1680.96 --> 1684.799
again

1682.64 --> 1688.76
uh

1684.799 --> 1690.5
maybe that is maybe not so much this

1688.76 --> 1692.24
time the last time I had to wait like

1690.5 --> 1695.24
several months because of supposed

1692.24 --> 1695.24
lockdowns

1701.059 --> 1705.94
so yeah that is gonna cost me some as

1703.7 --> 1705.94
well

1712.22 --> 1717.7
like last time it cost me 175 euros

1718.58 --> 1725.299
but I've done very long with it though

1722.659 --> 1729.159
I think I can still do like a month

1725.299 --> 1729.1589999999999
maybe two months with what I got left

1735.86 --> 1740.539
ah media muncher I've tried taking their

1738.26 --> 1742.039
side and have them arguing my side but

1740.539 --> 1744.5
it didn't work because they did yeah

1742.039 --> 1746.899
they can't get it past their lips

1744.5 --> 1749.779
like if they actually say it it's like

1746.899 --> 1751.58
an admittance that it's all just useless

1749.779 --> 1755.12
right

1751.58 --> 1757.34
to them to the Ballers and the anti-flat

1755.12 --> 1760.58
earthers but especially Ballers to them

1757.34 --> 1764.62
it's not a game it's

1760.58 --> 1764.62
a religious defense

1765.02 --> 1768.86
to us

1766.7 --> 1772.3400000000001
we're looking through it

1768.86 --> 1774.86
to us it is much more like a game

1772.34 --> 1776.779
and especially to me it's very much like

1774.86 --> 1779.9599999999998
a game

1776.779 --> 1782.779
although I do get the religious defense

1779.96 --> 1784.1000000000001
part about it and I can enact that I can

1782.779 --> 1786.26
reenact that

1784.1 --> 1789.6789999999999
but

1786.26 --> 1792.86
when you are stuck in that position

1789.679 --> 1795.98
then yeah it's too tough to act like a

1792.86 --> 1798.559
flat earther because every time

1795.98 --> 1801.44
you approach the core of the ACT which

1798.559 --> 1804.1399999999999
are the Flat Earth facts the knowledge

1801.44 --> 1807.44
the details

1804.14 --> 1809.419
they can't act like that because when

1807.44 --> 1811.88
they act like that they become it they

1809.419 --> 1814.3990000000001
see it and then it's all for nothing so

1811.88 --> 1817.94
they can't do it they can only like worm

1814.399 --> 1820.1589999999999
around flop around those facts and kind

1817.94 --> 1823.3990000000001
of try to point out the character traits

1820.159 --> 1826.0390000000002
or something like that right that's the

1823.399 --> 1828.6789999999999
only thing about the Flat Earth is they

1826.039 --> 1830.6
can really try to focus on

1828.679 --> 1833.299
because if they focus on the actual

1830.6 --> 1836.539
arguments it just all crumbles

1833.299 --> 1839.059
their religious dream crumbles

1836.539 --> 1841.36
like even when they acted it's that

1839.059 --> 1841.36
serious

1849.74 --> 1853.22
[Music]

1860.779 --> 1865.779
how do I get them to give it a chance

1866.36 --> 1871.039
there is a way

1868.58 --> 1872.299
but that way has nothing to do with

1871.039 --> 1873.62
facts

1872.299 --> 1877.279
you see

1873.62 --> 1880.1589999999999
you can't use the content the material

1877.279 --> 1881.659
the mechanics and all that to get them

1880.159 --> 1884.779
to listen

1881.659 --> 1887.8990000000001
only thing that works is by showing them

1884.779 --> 1889.58
that being a flat earther is much more

1887.899 --> 1892.58
satisfying

1889.58 --> 1892.58
gratifying

1892.82 --> 1898.399
and actually makes you smarter like if

1896.36 --> 1900.82
you can prove that part if you can you

1898.399 --> 1905.12
can basically

1900.82 --> 1907.1589999999999
seduce them by showing them that being a

1905.12 --> 1909.86
flat earther is better and that it can

1907.159 --> 1912.98
be better and that it isn't that the

1909.86 --> 1915.08
dumb asses that are also flat earthers

1912.98 --> 1917.48
right the ones that stand out that get

1915.08 --> 1921.22
highlighted because there are dumb asses

1917.48 --> 1924.919
too among flat earthers all kinds of

1921.22 --> 1928.46
quirks and problems and all that

1924.919 --> 1932.0590000000002
if you just show like yeah

1928.46 --> 1935.059
we're beyond that like there isn't an

1932.059 --> 1937.58
ideal way of doing things

1935.059 --> 1941.24
if you can show that

1937.58 --> 1942.62
that actually gets Ballers to listen

1941.24 --> 1945.26
somewhat

1942.62 --> 1947.6589999999999
because they want that they want

1945.26 --> 1951.1589999999999
to be better they want to self-improve

1947.659 --> 1951.159
they want to be greater

1952.159 --> 1954.7600000000002
you see

1957.38 --> 1961.88
so

1958.58 --> 1963.6789999999999
you yeah you have to show them

1961.88 --> 1966.5
you're smarter

1963.679 --> 1968.3600000000001
as a flat earther and that they can be

1966.5 --> 1971.899
smarter too

1968.36 --> 1975.019
but now the tricky part is to not do it

1971.899 --> 1979.34
by just showing them wrong

1975.019 --> 1981.5
and right concerning facts and mechanics

1979.34 --> 1983.9189999999999
you have to show them with everything

1981.5 --> 1983.919
else

1985.58 --> 1991.6399999999999
to make yourself like a reliable source

1988.76 --> 1994.76
to which they will step and tap into for

1991.64 --> 1997.519
their information and that's when it

1994.76 --> 2000.399
will start to become highlighted to them

1997.519 --> 2002.44
like this person actually knows what

2000.399 --> 2005.9799999999998
they're talking about

2002.44 --> 2010.179
and if they are a dedicated flat earther

2005.98 --> 2013.0
then Flat Earth can't be that bad as it

2010.179 --> 2015.3400000000001
feels and going there can't be that bad

2013.0 --> 2018.039
see that's

2015.34 --> 2020.5
probably the best way to do it

2018.039 --> 2023.32
because the Ballers that have become

2020.5 --> 2026.26
like really mechanically fanatic

2023.32 --> 2028.12
to reinforce the machinations and to

2026.26 --> 2030.519
really stick to it with psychological

2028.12 --> 2032.799
defense you can't reach them through

2030.519 --> 2034.48
that you can't reach them through the

2032.799 --> 2039.179
mechanics anymore that's where they are

2034.48 --> 2039.179
really trained to just outright deflect

2039.519 --> 2044.74
so you got to show it with everything

2041.32 --> 2047.82
else and that way you can slowly

2044.74 --> 2047.82
draw them out

2047.86 --> 2055.02
that's my tip

2050.619 --> 2055.02
and it's basically what I do

2055.52 --> 2061.119
[Music]

2058.48 --> 2063.28
it didn't help regarding regards to rent

2061.119 --> 2066.06
yeah but that's because ranty never gave

2063.28 --> 2066.0600000000004
[ __ ] really

2066.639 --> 2073.54
Randy is in it for the game he likes to

2069.7 --> 2076.1789999999996
win he likes to seem very smart

2073.54 --> 2078.899
but he has no heart

2076.179 --> 2078.899
in it

2079.78 --> 2083.5600000000004
right

2080.98 --> 2085.78
all that work he did he didn't do it

2083.56 --> 2088.2999999999997
because he loved Flat Earth he did it

2085.78 --> 2092.9190000000003
because he wanted to be seen

2088.3 --> 2095.7400000000002
as an ambitious smart fellow that is not

2092.919 --> 2098.3799999999997
shy to do work and get the credit for

2095.74 --> 2101.2
that and he did get the great he still

2098.38 --> 2104.5
gets the credit for it but he played all

2101.2 --> 2107.02
his moral chips in the process

2104.5 --> 2109.18
he just played him out

2107.02 --> 2111.72
didn't reconquer them

2109.18 --> 2111.72
see

2123.579 --> 2128.5
all right media muncher yeah good luck

2125.74 --> 2130.9199999999996
it's look it's not an easy quick win

2128.5 --> 2130.92
right

2138.76 --> 2141.48
I mean

2142.06 --> 2144.66
all right

2144.7 --> 2149.4399999999996
it just doesn't work like that

2146.46 --> 2151.96
convincing people with social matters

2149.44 --> 2155.52
and stances and energy personal energy

2151.96 --> 2155.52
it just takes longer

2155.98 --> 2163.119
and you there's risks too because if you

2159.82 --> 2165.579
at some point falter like really badly

2163.119 --> 2166.9
crumble and then like I'm giving up I'm

2165.579 --> 2170.1400000000003
out of here

2166.9 --> 2171.82
I like mentally like an actual mental

2170.14 --> 2174.04
breakdown where you literally can't

2171.82 --> 2176.56
handle anything anymore about it and are

2174.04 --> 2179.8
like running away in cowardice

2176.56 --> 2181.119
well if you try to pull people to your

2179.8 --> 2184.0600000000004
side

2181.119 --> 2187.599
by showing yourself as an example

2184.06 --> 2190.0
then when you have that you also risk

2187.599 --> 2191.56
them giving up

2190.0 --> 2194.92
if they're still in the middle of

2191.56 --> 2198.04
process of basically assimilating Flat

2194.92 --> 2198.04
Earth so

2198.4 --> 2201.839
you got to be dedicated

2202.54 --> 2210.0
see it through

2205.119 --> 2213.04
and allow the people that slowly drift

2210.0 --> 2216.76
towards you

2213.04 --> 2218.56
that they they go the entire way

2216.76 --> 2221.44
and that you don't just suddenly

2218.56 --> 2224.64
disappear in the middle of their process

2221.44 --> 2224.64
because it takes some time

2230.38 --> 2233.2200000000003
right anyway

2234.76 --> 2239.6800000000003
how long do you think it will take

2236.8 --> 2240.88
before Effie is in schools

2239.68 --> 2242.5
never

2240.88 --> 2245.619
it's not going to be in schools it's

2242.5 --> 2248.2
only maybe in some private schools in

2245.619 --> 2250.78
special clauses

2248.2 --> 2253.2999999999997
or separate classes there might be like

2250.78 --> 2255.099
Flat Earth classes as a separate thing

2253.3 --> 2257.5600000000004
that would be like on the niche list

2255.099 --> 2259.7200000000003
right like

2257.56 --> 2263.44
I don't know

2259.72 --> 2266.859
some like exotic religions studies or

2263.44 --> 2270.4
you know some exotic courses

2266.859 --> 2273.04
like it might be an option

2270.4 --> 2274.839
in schools like oh you can sign up for

2273.04 --> 2277.839
the Flat Earth but it's not going to be

2274.839 --> 2279.94
like in the main program that's never

2277.839 --> 2282.16
gonna happen there would be too much

2279.94 --> 2284.8
protest and it's probably going to stay

2282.16 --> 2289.42
like that like some people even protest

2284.8 --> 2291.579
like no we don't want like Bible reading

2289.42 --> 2293.32
but if you can sign up for it separately

2291.579 --> 2298.119
that's fine

2293.32 --> 2301.3590000000004
right that that sort of issue will also

2298.119 --> 2304.54
happen if you just try to standardize

2301.359 --> 2306.52
Flat Earth besides there's so much about

2304.54 --> 2310.3
it that's really not up for

2306.52 --> 2313.72
standardization it's too complex

2310.3 --> 2316.599
you would start to reify again using

2313.72 --> 2319.0
basic models that compare right you

2316.599 --> 2322.06
would basically make the students face

2319.0 --> 2325.26
the dichotomy between the disc

2322.06 --> 2325.2599999999998
on the ball

2325.48 --> 2329.7
that's not necessarily helpful

2329.859 --> 2335.619
right

2331.0 --> 2338.14
get into real like real flat earthing

2335.619 --> 2342.82
is very heavy stuff

2338.14 --> 2344.6189999999997
is it defies the typical mind the

2342.82 --> 2346.839
mindset

2344.619 --> 2348.46
because things are just not what you've

2346.839 --> 2351.099
always thought they were

2348.46 --> 2353.14
and that's not just oh it's flat and not

2351.099 --> 2355.42
a globe no it's like the celestial

2353.14 --> 2357.16
lights like we don't know what they are

2355.42 --> 2360.28
exactly

2357.16 --> 2363.52
but I personally think I am convinced

2360.28 --> 2366.7000000000003
and I'm willing to sit it through to

2363.52 --> 2369.22
figure it out someday hopefully I think

2366.7 --> 2371.3799999999997
that they're holographic in nature right

2369.22 --> 2374.0789999999997
how are you going to explain that to

2371.38 --> 2377.2200000000003
like a 12 year old

2374.079 --> 2377.2200000000003
well maybe you could

2377.56 --> 2381.46
but

2379.3 --> 2383.98
yeah they

2381.46 --> 2386.02
they'd had need some like preparation

2383.98 --> 2388.18
they need feedback they need parents

2386.02 --> 2390.099
that will be able to handle talking

2388.18 --> 2392.64
about that as well and see it gets

2390.099 --> 2392.6400000000003
complicated

2394.96 --> 2401.079
right and as long as the globe is like

2398.98 --> 2404.619
the main story

2401.079 --> 2408.3390000000004
factor of media out there and news and

2404.619 --> 2412.02
all that then Flat Earth classes are

2408.339 --> 2412.02
gonna ruffle feathers constantly

2430.119 --> 2437.98
won't if we need a map that can be used

2433.18 --> 2437.98
to navigate around the world uh

2439.3 --> 2445.48
well we have Maps

2441.819 --> 2446.859
their projections they still work it's

2445.48 --> 2449.56
just

2446.859 --> 2452.02
very unlikely that they're complete and

2449.56 --> 2455.68
super accurate it's just that

2452.02 --> 2459.48
they're accurate enough for basic going

2455.68 --> 2459.48
around the realm

2462.04 --> 2465.7799999999997
all right PG cruising see you later

2469.78 --> 2475.48
a compass does that right so they're

2472.3 --> 2477.28
Maps now are Compass oriented

2475.48 --> 2480.16
projections

2477.28 --> 2482.44
and they are useful to get around right

2480.16 --> 2485.2
that's not an issue

2482.44 --> 2487.8
the issue is that they're not perfectly

2485.2 --> 2490.54
accurate that they're not euclidean

2487.8 --> 2492.94
exact in every form that they're not

2490.54 --> 2496.74
perfectly to scale

2492.94 --> 2496.7400000000002
but that's a complicated problem

2507.22 --> 2511.7999999999997
so why would we need a map

2515.92 --> 2522.2200000000003
don't think having a having that

2518.98 --> 2525.839
euclidean map that is really perfect is

2522.22 --> 2525.839
essential to make a case

2526.0 --> 2531.22
against the globe

2528.88 --> 2536.2200000000003
just pointing out the flaws in the

2531.22 --> 2536.22
physics of the globe should suffice

2539.5 --> 2543.72
as a foundation to make a case

2544.3 --> 2548.7400000000002
right and sure there's lots of people

2546.64 --> 2552.16
that want that perfect map that's

2548.74 --> 2552.16
actually accurate

2553.3 --> 2557.7000000000003
well that's probably gonna take some

2555.339 --> 2557.7
effort

2558.64 --> 2564.46
because either it already exists and

2561.579 --> 2567.28
it's been very carefully hidden

2564.46 --> 2570.04
very carefully hidden

2567.28 --> 2574.2000000000003
or it's among the maps and we don't even

2570.04 --> 2574.2
realize that it is the accurate one

2574.48 --> 2580.66
or

2576.16 --> 2584.7999999999997
there's complications that simply make

2580.66 --> 2587.64
flat map projections impossible to make

2584.8 --> 2591.54
them to skill despite the Earth being

2587.64 --> 2591.54
geometrically flat

2591.88 --> 2597.28
it might despite that still be

2594.4 --> 2599.02
impossible to represent the realm in a

2597.28 --> 2601.8390000000004
euclideanian sense

2599.02 --> 2604.359
act perfectly accurate to scale it might

2601.839 --> 2605.74
simply not be physically possible to do

2604.359 --> 2611.22
that

2605.74 --> 2611.22
because of spatial non-linearity

2630.04 --> 2635.339
after fe's white one what are you

2632.319 --> 2635.339
talking about Moonshadow

2642.88 --> 2648.6400000000003
no they already have it they don't use

2646.06 --> 2652.18
Globe geometry Moonshadow don't you get

2648.64 --> 2655.5989999999997
it they all they all use flat

2652.18 --> 2659.16
projections they all like GPS uses flat

2655.599 --> 2659.1600000000003
projections it it all does

2660.28 --> 2663.5400000000004
they already got it

2664.78 --> 2668.92
we need no need to correct anything for

2667.839 --> 2670.599
them

2668.92 --> 2674.4
it all works

2670.599 --> 2674.4
it works just fine the way it is

2679.839 --> 2685.359
if it hadn't been

2682.68 --> 2688.1189999999997
then everything would be a giant mess

2685.359 --> 2690.7
and there wouldn't be

2688.119 --> 2693.099
any modern society like at all

2690.7 --> 2694.359
everything would simply be completely

2693.099 --> 2696.579
broken

2694.359 --> 2698.38
and incomplete

2696.579 --> 2701.28
and lost

2698.38 --> 2701.28
and it isn't

2702.4 --> 2710.56
that's because they're already using

2706.0 --> 2710.56
flat measured out systems

2712.0 --> 2716.74
euclidean measurements right the

2714.76 --> 2719.98
measurements are there

2716.74 --> 2725.9399999999996
yeah they they do

2719.98 --> 2725.94
use this s w g s 84.

2726.46 --> 2730.54
yeah

2728.68 --> 2733.859
it's all flat though

2730.54 --> 2733.859
because it's measured flat

2734.319 --> 2739.66
right and you can project that onto a

2737.38 --> 2742.1800000000003
glow projection

2739.66 --> 2744.2799999999997
the trickery for that is very easy to do

2742.18 --> 2748.1189999999997
but all of the measurements are flat all

2744.28 --> 2753.2200000000003
of the scans are all flat all of it

2748.119 --> 2754.6800000000003
there's no curve within any of the scans

2753.22 --> 2758.5789999999997
within GPS

2754.68 --> 2758.5789999999997
Global mclo place

2772.54 --> 2776.98
yes I know what it is just have to

2775.18 --> 2780.22
refresh my memory

2776.98 --> 2782.319
but hey I'm I'm very okay to just ban

2780.22 --> 2785.9399999999996

2782.319 --> 2785.94
know over this [ __ ]

2809.98 --> 2812.7
hmm

2825.339 --> 2829.5
all right

2826.9 --> 2829.5
yeah

2829.78 --> 2839.5
yeah the the globe projection thing the

2834.599 --> 2844.5
wgs for 84. yeah that's that's still all

2839.5 --> 2844.5
flat it's just projected into a glow

2845.079 --> 2850.119
people want to check there is no

2847.0 --> 2854.14
challenge Club my club face the Earth is

2850.119 --> 2858.52
flat I don't give a fleeting [ __ ]

2854.14 --> 2861.46
what you think reality is

2858.52 --> 2865.0
okay I don't care

2861.46 --> 2869.46
it's flat it's absolutely flat and I'm

2865.0 --> 2869.46
not willing to entertain your chanting

2883.9 --> 2887.94
yeah get the [ __ ] out of here [ __ ]

2890.02 --> 2895.599
and next time

2892.9 --> 2899.88
think of a name that's actually has some

2895.599 --> 2899.88
dignity to it about that

2900.0 --> 2903.72
you are chanting

2925.059 --> 2929.8190000000004
what the hell

2927.64 --> 2929.819
foreign

2931.44 --> 2936.18
moderating system is so broken sometimes

2956.16 --> 2959.35
[Music]

2965.02 --> 2971.319
it

2967.02 --> 2974.44
seriously I am not going to start

2971.319 --> 2977.5589999999997
getting into this [ __ ] anymore like I

2974.44 --> 2979.7200000000003
literally don't care I'm erasing it I'm

2977.559 --> 2981.099
erasing the machinations from my mind

2979.72 --> 2984.7599999999998
Glovers

2981.099 --> 2988.599
I don't give a [ __ ] even as Bowen I will

2984.76 --> 2990.46
never touch these types of shitty shitty

2988.599 --> 2993.1600000000003
arguments right

2990.46 --> 2996.16
globin will be much more straightforward

2993.16 --> 3000.5
honest about his religious convictions

2996.16 --> 3005.46
I will never entertain the nitpicking

3000.5 --> 3008.66
whiny [ __ ] Globe lie arguments about

3005.46 --> 3008.66
this [ __ ] ever

3008.94 --> 3014.28
you can all [ __ ] off

3011.64 --> 3016.64
choke on your stupid little spherical

3014.28 --> 3016.6400000000003
math

3043.92 --> 3050.46
right and yeah Sun monkey 3D

3047.72 --> 3052.5
non-linearity of space is it bending or

3050.46 --> 3054.78
compressing or something yeah or

3052.5 --> 3057.3
something that's right

3054.78 --> 3060.2400000000002
it's maybe simple that the the way that

3057.3 --> 3062.579
space itself is interconnected like

3060.24 --> 3065.24
looping in on itself but how it is

3062.579 --> 3068.94
looping on itself might be very

3065.24 --> 3070.68
irregularly corrected connected in the

3068.94 --> 3073.38
sense that you will walk in perfect

3070.68 --> 3076.2
euclidean straight lines

3073.38 --> 3076.98
and then either end up in exactly the

3076.2 --> 3079.7599999999998
same

3076.98 --> 3082.559
road that you started moving

3079.76 --> 3086.4
or literally

3082.559 --> 3089.2200000000003
bump into it from another angle

3086.4 --> 3091.38
even though you literally walked a

3089.22 --> 3094.6189999999997
straight line

3091.38 --> 3097.079
literally a perfect non-deviating

3094.619 --> 3100.44
straight line and then you end up

3097.079 --> 3105.3590000000004
like diagonally crossing your own route

3100.44 --> 3105.359
right now that's spatial non-linearity

3112.319 --> 3116.4
it has nothing to do with time and space

3114.359 --> 3117.72
so you can start water is nothing

3116.4 --> 3120.059
whatsoever

3117.72 --> 3122.339
it's not space time it's nothing to do

3120.059 --> 3123.3
with Einstein conceptual mechanics at

3122.339 --> 3126.7799999999997
all

3123.3 --> 3128.7000000000003
this is pure spatiality

3126.78 --> 3130.52
doesn't even have to do with

3128.7 --> 3134.2999999999997
second third

3130.52 --> 3138.859
dimension no it's lit this is about

3134.3 --> 3138.8590000000004
volumetric interconnection this is about

3140.339 --> 3145.7
how the volume interacts with itself

3150.0 --> 3154.859
I don't know it I'm not really now at

3153.0 --> 3157.04
the best condition to start explaining

3154.859 --> 3157.04
it

3157.14 --> 3164.72
okay I want to take it easy a bit

3160.02 --> 3164.72
but I'll get back to that at some point

3168.51 --> 3171.6690000000003
[Music]

3187.76 --> 3191.88
#truth known what are you blabbering

3190.079 --> 3194.3390000000004
about Jason McCormack

3191.88 --> 3197.7000000000003
are you disappointed you can you can't

3194.339 --> 3199.92
roll out your stupid little chant

3197.7 --> 3202.5589999999997
are you disappointed I made it

3199.92 --> 3205.4
impossible for you specifically for you

3202.559 --> 3205.4
to do that

3215.119 --> 3219.02
stationary container Earth

3224.96 --> 3228.44
contain well

3228.96 --> 3235.099
that's a difficult statement to say the

3231.48 --> 3235.099
Earth is the container no

3237.059 --> 3242.3390000000004
there's no guarantee that

3239.28 --> 3246.02
the container actually has a physical

3242.339 --> 3246.02
barrier everywhere

3248.46 --> 3251.599
but that doesn't mean that there is

3250.44 --> 3255.9
available

3251.599 --> 3258.3590000000004
volume for matter to move into Beyond

3255.9 --> 3262.619
certain points

3258.359 --> 3264.7799999999997
Beyond certain metrics huh

3262.619 --> 3268.7400000000002
right the suggestion that there is

3264.78 --> 3271.5
infinite space available is really the

3268.74 --> 3274.3799999999997
biggest science fiction of all

3271.5 --> 3278.9
just the suggestion endless room that's

3274.38 --> 3278.9
the real sci-fi deep diver

3279.359 --> 3285.66
so I'm I've stepped away from that

3282.66 --> 3288.359
and thereby I could suggest like yeah

3285.66 --> 3291.24
maybe there is just x amount of volume

3288.359 --> 3293.64
available Beyond it simply matter cannot

3291.24 --> 3295.859
move beyond that point like at all

3293.64 --> 3300.18
doesn't matter what it is whether it's

3295.859 --> 3303.48
gas liquid solid hard

3300.18 --> 3306.74
lots of energy explosion no it's just

3303.48 --> 3309.9
simply matter can't move Beyond

3306.74 --> 3312.8999999999996
a virtual barrier it would seem like a

3309.9 --> 3316.94
barrier from within but it simply is a

3312.9 --> 3316.94
limit to where matter can move

3317.7 --> 3323.52
there would be no physical container it

3321.42 --> 3326.28
would simply be the end

3323.52 --> 3330.319
the end to which matter can move a

3326.28 --> 3330.3190000000004
matter cannot move beyond that point

3332.52 --> 3337.98
what if you are just banned Jason

3335.94 --> 3340.38
McCormack

3337.98 --> 3343.38
sick of it

3340.38 --> 3347.52
you have no no contributions you talk

3343.38 --> 3348.6800000000003
about oh smoking weed and your stupid

3347.52 --> 3352.859
little

3348.68 --> 3354.5989999999997
curved based religious nonsense and you

3352.859 --> 3357.359
keep at it and that's why I originally

3354.599 --> 3359.2200000000003
banned you and I'm now doing it again

3357.359 --> 3362.04
I don't want you here

3359.22 --> 3364.859
you're a dumbass

3362.04 --> 3368.46
and a religious Nutter a cultist by

3364.859 --> 3370.2599999999998
every metric at this point

3368.46 --> 3372.359
where's your ideas

3370.26 --> 3374.3390000000004
where's your contributions where's your

3372.359 --> 3377.96
intellectual development you don't have

3374.339 --> 3377.96
any so get the [ __ ] out

3380.31 --> 3383.389
[Music]

3385.75 --> 3388.969
[Music]

3417.0 --> 3422.339
how do satellites move well satellites

3420.299 --> 3424.52
what satellites Moon Shadow what the

3422.339 --> 3424.52
hell

3425.099 --> 3428.96
what do you think satellites are

3431.16 --> 3437.819
I think that every time we get serious

3433.619 --> 3442.5
imagery like a high quality actual good

3437.819 --> 3444.96
photography it's spy planes

3442.5 --> 3447.9
and the spy planes have been made over

3444.96 --> 3449.64
the ages to be able to go up higher and

3447.9 --> 3453.98
higher and higher

3449.64 --> 3453.98
like really high

3454.74 --> 3460.859
and then there's options of zeppelins

3458.16 --> 3463.2
probably couldn't go as high

3460.859 --> 3466.44
they could also do it but yeah I think

3463.2 --> 3468.6189999999997
overall any real interesting photography

3466.44 --> 3471.78
from very high up of the earth's surface

3468.619 --> 3474.7200000000003
is by spy planes

3471.78 --> 3477.1800000000003
they've been using that well since they

3474.72 --> 3480.68
first conceived of satellites which is

3477.18 --> 3480.68
after the airplane era

3483.9 --> 3487.619
right

3485.099 --> 3488.7200000000003
they invented airplanes like oh look at

3487.619 --> 3491.4
this

3488.72 --> 3493.2
propeller flights dog flights and then

3491.4 --> 3494.52
like oh it's getting better oh better

3493.2 --> 3496.3799999999997
engines

3494.52 --> 3498.54
and then oh look we're inventing

3496.38 --> 3501.1800000000003
satellites yeah guess why because now

3498.54 --> 3504.119
finally they had planes that could go

3501.18 --> 3506.72
high enough in order to act like their

3504.119 --> 3506.7200000000003
satellites

3528.119 --> 3531.38
hey cleavery by the way

3538.45 --> 3544.8799999999997
[Music]

3574.2 --> 3577.46
all right anything else

3581.579 --> 3587.7200000000003
I still got

3583.559 --> 3587.7200000000003
15 minutes to go roughly

3590.52 --> 3594.54
anyone wants to contest my Banning

3593.28 --> 3598.46
decisions

3594.54 --> 3598.46
speak up now or be silent forever

3605.88 --> 3611.4
or yeah if you're a stock account

3608.339 --> 3613.7
speaking up then be silent forever

3611.4 --> 3613.7000000000003
anyway

3619.23 --> 3624.219
[Music]

3664.619 --> 3670.26
okay that's it then I could just round

3667.859 --> 3674.16
out the show you know

3670.26 --> 3676.5
I can decide to do that if people just

3674.16 --> 3679.5
stop talking at all

3676.5 --> 3683.059
I can't just decide to end the show

3679.5 --> 3683.059
you know it's up to you

3684.599 --> 3689.9
anyone seen evil starlink in the night

3687.299 --> 3689.9
sky no

3690.839 --> 3694.04
like what is that even

3697.619 --> 3701.9
couldn't it just be high altitude drones

3729.72 --> 3732.72
foreign

3736.02 --> 3738.2
foreign

3756.18 --> 3761.18
no you're bard

3758.46 --> 3761.18
get out

3765.299 --> 3771.66
the only reason you're here is to waste

3769.079 --> 3776.599
our time and insert your stupid little

3771.66 --> 3776.5989999999997
cult chance so [ __ ] off Jason

3795.24 --> 3799.75
ah

3796.56 --> 3799.75
[Music]

3811.799 --> 3818.64
who is Jason it's the guy with the

3814.44 --> 3821.88
stupid blue wireframe Globe that's who

3818.64 --> 3824.46
he's a he's a concaver

3821.88 --> 3827.2200000000003
and he's been spamming that [ __ ] for

3824.46 --> 3831.2400000000002
like five years now something like that

3827.22 --> 3834.66
and he never shuts up and he never ever

3831.24 --> 3837.4199999999996
develops his arguments never ever he's

3834.66 --> 3840.66
literally spamming the same nonsense as

3837.42 --> 3842.64
he did in the very start no like he

3840.66 --> 3844.92
could literally be a bot but I don't

3842.64 --> 3849.3799999999997
think he is a bot I think he's just

3844.92 --> 3849.38
really freaking dumb and annoying

3850.14 --> 3855.5
a guy that's probably burned himself out

3852.42 --> 3855.5
with drugs at some point

3879.78 --> 3884.8390000000004
so

3882.24 --> 3884.839
all right

3898.859 --> 3906.98
all right so what about it guys

3902.76 --> 3906.98
what about it Bad Karma Moonshadow

3909.539 --> 3914.9
there anybody else left or did any

3911.76 --> 3914.9
everybody just leave

3914.94 --> 3917.48
ah

3917.52 --> 3921.66
I mean maybe you did maybe you're

3919.98 --> 3924.42
offended by me

3921.66 --> 3927.2599999999998
just Banning people

3924.42 --> 3927.26
I don't know

3951.66 --> 3958.3999999999996
just like to know

3955.02 --> 3958.4
I would like to know what

3963.48 --> 3970.079
right but like what is it

3966.48 --> 3974.099
like it's very simple guys it's just

3970.079 --> 3976.26
drones flying in formation

3974.099 --> 3978.6600000000003
it's not hard to Def it's not difficult

3976.26 --> 3983.28
to figure it out

3978.66 --> 3987.5989999999997
right drones can

3983.28 --> 3990.8390000000004
fly perfectly stable like so stable that

3987.599 --> 3993.48
yeah they could literally mimic what we

3990.839 --> 3997.16
would think of as an orbit they could

3993.48 --> 4001.22
literally just mimic it it's that easy

3997.16 --> 4003.5589999999997
it's just high altitude drones

4001.22 --> 4006.8799999999997
flying information

4003.559 --> 4006.88
with a little light

4006.98 --> 4010.119
guys come on

4025.72 --> 4028.8399999999997
[Music]

4030.5 --> 4037.9
and maybe they do have like internet

4033.64 --> 4037.9
relays in them and that's pretty cool

4039.799 --> 4045.799
it's kind of silly that it's mimicking

4042.74 --> 4047.4799999999996
like it's satellites in orbit that part

4045.799 --> 4049.7
is really silly

4047.48 --> 4052.28
if you're just like uh here's like the

4049.7 --> 4054.319
high altitude drone hovering system and

4052.28 --> 4057.2200000000003
they're really great internet relays

4054.319 --> 4057.22
yeah sure

4057.92 --> 4065.92
they are too fast for drones oh really

4062.96 --> 4065.92
how would you know

4070.579 --> 4076.46
maybe they're high speed drones

4073.039 --> 4079.46
I'm not talking about just regular

4076.46 --> 4081.92
for propeller and a body and a camera

4079.46 --> 4086.059
type of drones here talking about

4081.92 --> 4089.619
special designed high altitude ones and

4086.059 --> 4089.619
they're probably made to go fast

4114.859 --> 4117.859
goodie

4122.179 --> 4126.799
foreign

4124.52 --> 4129.080000000001
guys I've talked about this in the past

4126.799 --> 4130.64
like yeah basic technological

4129.08 --> 4133.339
applications

4130.64 --> 4135.679
yeah you could use a balloon or you

4133.339 --> 4138.5599999999995
could just like launch a drone like

4135.679 --> 4140.6
whoop relay right there in the sky you

4138.56 --> 4145.120000000001
don't have to quickly build a tower or

4140.6 --> 4145.120000000001
anything you just send up a drone

4147.679 --> 4151.64
and then yeah eventually the battery

4149.779 --> 4153.38
runs out and then you send up another

4151.64 --> 4155.299
drone and then you recharge the other

4153.38 --> 4156.799
one and you just keep on going and going

4155.299 --> 4159.94
and

4156.799 --> 4159.94
very simple

4161.299 --> 4166.2789999999995
and probably pretty useful as a

4163.759 --> 4168.44
temporary solution before you can build

4166.279 --> 4171.14
something more permanent or if there's

4168.44 --> 4173.599999999999
no ability no option to build something

4171.14 --> 4176.9800000000005
permanent like a good Tower then you

4173.6 --> 4176.9800000000005
just keep doing that and why not

4188.779 --> 4194.6
what kind of fuel source the Elon drones

4192.199 --> 4197.9
I don't know

4194.6 --> 4199.219
maybe maybe they use like the vacuum

4197.9 --> 4203.239
engine

4199.219 --> 4204.56
so it they could maybe literally go on

4203.239 --> 4207.139999999999
forever

4204.56 --> 4210.38
they only needed startup fuel who knows

4207.14 --> 4212.3
man I don't know exactly what the design

4210.38 --> 4215.3
of these things would be I just know

4212.3 --> 4218.08
that I could definitely conceive of how

4215.3 --> 4218.08
it would be done

4219.44 --> 4225.678999999999
like how you can mimic that

4223.4 --> 4229.339999999999
high altitude drones right if they can

4225.679 --> 4230.96
make spy planes that are invisible

4229.34 --> 4234.7390000000005
well

4230.96 --> 4236.96
who's to stop it from Just even just

4234.739 --> 4239.0599999999995
using spy planes and just attaching

4236.96 --> 4241.36
lights to it and then making fly

4239.06 --> 4241.360000000001
information

4241.82 --> 4248.739
right you you wouldn't necessarily even

4244.88 --> 4248.7390000000005
have to build something new for it

4254.179 --> 4260.4800000000005
right it could be as basic as they're

4256.46 --> 4262.219
just spy planes that Elon kind of bought

4260.48 --> 4265.28
up because probably the military

4262.219 --> 4269.14
developed newer ones right it could be

4265.28 --> 4269.139999999999
that basic guys come on

4285.5 --> 4291.32
did your cousin built Starling

4288.4 --> 4294.44
satellites Oh you mean like

4291.32 --> 4296.36
he works on the prop

4294.44 --> 4298.879999999999
the thing that's not actually going

4296.36 --> 4301.46
anywhere is probably gonna land in a

4298.88 --> 4303.8
trash Heap or getting recycled or in a

4301.46 --> 4306.26
museum perhaps

4303.8 --> 4308.0
the things that aren't actually sent up

4306.26 --> 4310.400000000001
there yeah yeah

4308.0 --> 4313.28
lots of people build satellites it's

4310.4 --> 4315.98
part of the globe conditioning let

4313.28 --> 4317.659
engineers build the science fiction

4315.98 --> 4320.299999999999
object

4317.659 --> 4323.78
so they there are witnesses that can say

4320.3 --> 4326.4800000000005
but I built the satellite it must be

4323.78 --> 4328.759999999999
real I built it myself I put the pieces

4326.48 --> 4332.36
together it functions exactly like a

4328.76 --> 4335.62
satellite would in orbit right it's all

4332.36 --> 4335.62
part of the conditioning

4336.199 --> 4342.699
it's just the props they work on it's

4338.96 --> 4342.699
part of the satellite hoax

4344.239 --> 4349.639999999999
have something real they sent send up if

4347.9 --> 4353.0599999999995
they even have to

4349.64 --> 4355.219
it's probably a drone some kind maybe

4353.06 --> 4359.780000000001
the spy plane

4355.219 --> 4361.58
and yeah make people just get built a

4359.78 --> 4364.179
satellite according to the Sci-Fi

4361.58 --> 4364.179
concept

4376.34 --> 4381.4400000000005
what are you talking about Mike said

4378.28 --> 4383.599999999999
Banner drag behind a plane with lights

4381.44 --> 4385.759999999999
at night no

4383.6 --> 4388.34
no

4385.76 --> 4390.26
it wouldn't stay in formation like that

4388.34 --> 4393.26
Mike sudunich

4390.26 --> 4393.26
dragging

4393.679 --> 4399.86
dragging it's gonna wobble all right

4397.34 --> 4402.5
have you ever seen just a regular like

4399.86 --> 4405.699
advertisement plane right with with the

4402.5 --> 4405.699
banner flying behind it

4406.159 --> 4411.46
how is it gonna stay perfectly straight

4408.86 --> 4411.46
like that

4414.739 --> 4420.678999999999
beside is it always presented it is in a

4418.159 --> 4422.48
perfect line is it only ever visible in

4420.679 --> 4425.06
a perfect line

4422.48 --> 4427.299999999999
because then maybe there is something to

4425.06 --> 4427.3
that

4433.56 --> 4437.529
[Music]

4440.6 --> 4447.02
but yeah at high altitude like using

4443.48 --> 4450.459999999999
just thing dragging behind one vehicle

4447.02 --> 4450.46
that's gonna give issues

4462.739 --> 4469.839999999999
A Thousand Miles Moonshadow what that

4465.679 --> 4469.84
where are you getting the Thousand Miles

4471.199 --> 4478.178999999999
like where are you a thousand where are

4475.46 --> 4478.179
you getting that

4478.28 --> 4484.639999999999
that's ridiculous

4480.02 --> 4487.280000000001
that's a quarter of of the diameter

4484.64 --> 4489.62
or something right

4487.28 --> 4491.84
no wait it's like an eighth it's a

4489.62 --> 4495.26
quarter after that's ridiculous lengths

4491.84 --> 4497.42
like nothing would ever look that wide

4495.26 --> 4500.54
apart on the globe ever it would

4497.42 --> 4503.179
literally take up the entire sky

4500.54 --> 4505.28
like the entire Sky one straight line

4503.179 --> 4508.34
from one part of the Horizon to the

4505.28 --> 4511.4
other that's ridiculous

4508.34 --> 4513.56
Thousand Miles really

4511.4 --> 4516.339999999999
how could you ever see a thousand miles

4513.56 --> 4516.34
in one View

4516.679 --> 4521.4400000000005
above you

4518.12 --> 4521.44
that's just bizarre

4528.62 --> 4532.699
do you think Elon gets paid to a lot of

4531.08 --> 4534.98
money to employ people to make fake

4532.699 --> 4538.219
satellites oh yeah of course

4534.98 --> 4540.4
is part of a program they get funds for

4538.219 --> 4540.4
that

4542.9 --> 4548.92
what do you think is going to have where

4545.0 --> 4548.92
do you think all that NASA money goes

4549.56 --> 4555.9800000000005
it's all just special project money

4553.1 --> 4558.02
it's specifically so people can be

4555.98 --> 4560.0
designated to waste their time building

4558.02 --> 4562.52
supposed satellites that it will never

4560.0 --> 4565.34
be used that's exactly why they have

4562.52 --> 4568.64
such insane budgets for that sort of

4565.34 --> 4568.64
[ __ ] occupational

4568.84 --> 4574.6990000000005
busying therapy

4571.52 --> 4577.6990000000005
hiring people like 50 people 20 people

4574.699 --> 4580.28
50 in a room sitting behind computers

4577.699 --> 4583.099999999999
supposedly doing something

4580.28 --> 4585.5599999999995
like that's what they do the money is

4583.1 --> 4587.84
for busying therapy

4585.56 --> 4591.76
building satellites is a big key

4587.84 --> 4591.76
component of that therapy

4607.76 --> 4610.6
what

4611.5 --> 4620.32
satelloons are being morphed into drone

4615.62 --> 4620.32
drone that doesn't make any sense

4622.04 --> 4627.199
unless literally satelloons are made to

4625.64 --> 4629.0
do that I don't think so I don't know

4627.199 --> 4632.98
where you're getting that it's weird

4629.0 --> 4632.98
anyway be back in two minutes

4728.0 --> 4730.84
foreign

4734.719 --> 4740.78
yo

4737.48 --> 4742.218999999999
how about that Globe head on Nathan or

4740.78 --> 4745.96
three yeah

4742.219 --> 4745.96
yeah there's no player in town

4747.32 --> 4753.799999999999
and that guy just refused to step away

4750.38 --> 4757.0
like he just would not give up

4753.8 --> 4757.0
he gave it his all

4768.86 --> 4773.179
will they ever stop these days they are

4771.02 --> 4775.159000000001
launching every week they will never

4773.179 --> 4777.92
stop

4775.159 --> 4780.32
until the Investments no longer worth it

4777.92 --> 4784.1
and with investment I mean

4780.32 --> 4787.04
people with infinite money

4784.1 --> 4788.4800000000005
that literally choose what to waste it

4787.04 --> 4790.82
all on

4788.48 --> 4793.94
so as long as they think that wasting it

4790.82 --> 4797.599999999999
all on the indoctrination nonsense is

4793.94 --> 4799.639999999999
somehow worth it they'll keep doing it

4797.6 --> 4802.52
they'll do it every day

4799.64 --> 4804.38
like dude like what is stopping them at

4802.52 --> 4806.4800000000005
this point what's stopping them from

4804.38 --> 4809.96
literally having

4806.48 --> 4812.299999999999
rocket launches in every freaking city

4809.96 --> 4815.08
in the world like there's nothing to

4812.3 --> 4815.08
stop that because

4815.12 --> 4818.139
infinite money

4818.239 --> 4821.919999999999
can make infinite nonsense

4823.46 --> 4828.34
and it's all much cheaper than it really

4825.62 --> 4828.34
looks anyway

4862.63 --> 4866.06
[Music]

4872.6 --> 4874.780000000001
foreign

4885.699 --> 4890.5
Ty program to self-destruct no

4891.62 --> 4898.42
it is programmed to corrupt when it gets

4895.46 --> 4898.42
too much power

4899.719 --> 4905.4800000000005
and then those with that too much power

4902.9 --> 4909.219
will start taking it from everybody else

4905.48 --> 4909.218999999999
and that's the destruction

4913.76 --> 4919.46
but Humanity in reality doesn't have the

4916.639 --> 4923.719
power to destroy itself not really

4919.46 --> 4927.8
literally God stops it like people that

4923.719 --> 4931.34
are like possessed by their power

4927.8 --> 4933.4400000000005
they are maneuvered by God and if they

4931.34 --> 4935.9800000000005
would maneuver like okay we're going to

4933.44 --> 4935.98
actually

4936.159 --> 4941.54
develop this thing that will literally

4939.56 --> 4944.780000000001
kill everybody

4941.54 --> 4946.639
like it's simply like God just like

4944.78 --> 4949.04
kidding

4946.639 --> 4951.1990000000005
nope

4949.04 --> 4954.5
they just can't do it

4951.199 --> 4958.4
they cannot do it

4954.5 --> 4960.26
God literally doesn't allow it I know I

4958.4 --> 4962.54
say that sometimes

4960.26 --> 4965.62
that's a real thing

4962.54 --> 4965.62
you'll find out

4972.62 --> 4977.719
like if God would allow such things we

4976.04 --> 4980.3
would have been dead

4977.719 --> 4981.56
a thousand Generations ago there would

4980.3 --> 4985.96
be nothing

4981.56 --> 4985.96
maybe jungle that's it

4990.8 --> 4996.38
I mean we can't annihilate ourselves

4994.94 --> 4999.5
we can

4996.38 --> 5003.159000000001
take our own lives or

4999.5 --> 5004.42
ruin things could make a giant mess of

5003.159 --> 5006.5199999999995
things

5004.42 --> 5009.2390000000005
cannot destroy it

5006.52 --> 5009.2390000000005
not really

5009.82 --> 5014.92
because those

5011.92 --> 5018.54
that are the corrupted ones that would

5014.92 --> 5020.639
want to do that would fantasize about it

5018.54 --> 5023.139
will be

5020.639 --> 5026.139
disabled from doing it from going there

5023.139 --> 5029.7390000000005
it's like literally God just erects a

5026.139 --> 5032.08
virtual spiritual wall right in front of

5029.739 --> 5034.239
them whenever they truly think that

5032.08 --> 5037.36
they're gonna do that

5034.239 --> 5042.339999999999
will be pulled out of their simulation

5037.36 --> 5046.179
and face the throne and then be told

5042.34 --> 5048.04
you can only choose to destroy yourself

5046.179 --> 5050.219
that's where this will lead if you

5048.04 --> 5050.219
continue

5051.46 --> 5057.219
right

5053.86 --> 5059.4
sounds very heavy stuff that's what

5057.219 --> 5059.4
happens

5078.52 --> 5082.4800000000005
that's why they do it with light that's

5080.8 --> 5084.88
correct

5082.48 --> 5087.159
they're basically only allowed to trick

5084.88 --> 5089.7390000000005
people into destroying themselves that's

5087.159 --> 5092.799999999999
the condition

5089.739 --> 5095.5
they cannot in one fill Fell Swoop

5092.8 --> 5097.96
destroy it all it's impossible they

5095.5 --> 5100.9
can't do it

5097.96 --> 5104.9800000000005
like they are physically incapable of

5100.9 --> 5107.138999999999
doing that even though mechanically in a

5104.98 --> 5109.659
schematic and in the math it would work

5107.139 --> 5112.179
they cannot

5109.659 --> 5114.5199999999995
do it

5112.179 --> 5116.56
not because of moral objections but

5114.52 --> 5120.659000000001
simply because God

5116.56 --> 5120.659000000001
just doesn't allow it

5123.94 --> 5128.58
I think God will stop genocide one day

5126.1 --> 5128.58
nope

5131.08 --> 5133.92
absolutely not

5137.139 --> 5142.6
no no genocide is there to remind

5139.78 --> 5145.199
everybody that things can get pretty

5142.6 --> 5145.1990000000005
[ __ ] up

5145.42 --> 5151.12
but also like the destruction and the

5148.719 --> 5152.44
death and the tricking people into doing

5151.12 --> 5156.76
that

5152.44 --> 5160.138999999999
is part of just

5156.76 --> 5160.139
mowing the lawn

5160.659 --> 5166.0
all generations have good people and bad

5164.44 --> 5170.138999999999
people in them

5166.0 --> 5173.86
the bad people only make things worse

5170.139 --> 5177.4800000000005
so if you just let it all sit there it's

5173.86 --> 5181.839999999999
gonna turn into like a swamp

5177.48 --> 5184.78
and mechanically It All Leads

5181.84 --> 5188.08
to the same end result it's it's the

5184.78 --> 5191.5
system balancing itself out

5188.08 --> 5193.9
there is no God no there is

5191.5 --> 5195.94
you're an absolute idiot if you think

5193.9 --> 5198.699
otherwise an idiot this is not about

5195.94 --> 5201.94
religious [ __ ] Faith this is about

5198.699 --> 5205.919999999999
absolute logic

5201.94 --> 5205.919999999999
the only option available

5218.56 --> 5221.159000000001
ah

5231.88 --> 5234.42
right

5250.42 --> 5254.62
how do I come up with this stuff what

5252.639 --> 5257.46
are you talking about Bobby steals are

5254.62 --> 5257.46
you addressing me

5261.639 --> 5267.76
is that it

5263.02 --> 5269.679
two wolves no if you enter this chat by

5267.76 --> 5271.719
saying that

5269.679 --> 5274.5
blank

5271.719 --> 5274.5
your band

5280.96 --> 5283.44
all right

5295.36 --> 5300.699
so Bobby steals you addressing me or are

5298.06 --> 5303.219
you just all Ballers rolling in my chat

5300.699 --> 5305.739
just muttering incoherently against each

5303.219 --> 5308.08
other now is that what you're doing just

5305.739 --> 5311.86
muttering like a bunch of freaks

5308.08 --> 5314.32
being exposed to a glimpse of the actual

5311.86 --> 5316.48
facing a god which does occur in this

5314.32 --> 5318.4
world under very specific conditions I

5316.48 --> 5320.32
freaking bent through it

5318.4 --> 5323.159
yeah

5320.32 --> 5323.159
this is

5324.82 --> 5327.659
deal with it

5327.94 --> 5333.759999999999
muttering fundies

5330.76 --> 5336.280000000001
God is there he doesn't give a [ __ ] if

5333.76 --> 5337.3
you believe in him or not it's up up for

5336.28 --> 5339.759999999999
you

5337.3 --> 5343.659000000001
to figure it out and to reap the

5339.76 --> 5345.58
benefits of accepting the truth

5343.659 --> 5347.799999999999
which is

5345.58 --> 5350.139
God

5347.8 --> 5353.52
in an esoteric sense

5350.139 --> 5353.52
it's absolutely true though

5356.08 --> 5364.179
cool thanks so what does that mean

5361.659 --> 5367.739
Bobby steals

5364.179 --> 5367.7390000000005
are you just blabbering now

5395.38 --> 5399.52
do you ever think they really counteract

5397.6 --> 5400.900000000001
relative density and build cities in the

5399.52 --> 5402.9400000000005
sky

5400.9 --> 5404.5599999999995
well they won't be able to build them in

5402.94 --> 5407.699
this guy

5404.56 --> 5412.84
but yeah

5407.699 --> 5414.94
airships or like floating cities sure

5412.84 --> 5417.34
you know there's just going to be one

5414.94 --> 5421.12
problem about it it's gonna it's gonna

5417.34 --> 5425.28
eat energy like a madman

5421.12 --> 5428.0199999999995
and if it uses some super efficient or

5425.28 --> 5431.739
suggestibly free energy

5428.02 --> 5435.6990000000005
and it actually uses that huge amount to

5431.739 --> 5439.178999999999
do that then there might be side effects

5435.699 --> 5441.879999999999
potentially disastrous side effects

5439.179 --> 5444.28
right but there have been flying cities

5441.88 --> 5447.96
in the past

5444.28 --> 5447.96
they're recorded

5449.98 --> 5452.759999999999
Indian history

5453.1 --> 5459.76
so yeah if they were there in the past

5456.159 --> 5461.5599999999995
they can be here in modern day as well

5459.76 --> 5462.46
it's just like what do you want to do

5461.56 --> 5465.639
with that

5462.46 --> 5467.679
also things can basically blow up a lot

5465.639 --> 5470.1990000000005
easier now

5467.679 --> 5472.78
than in the past

5470.199 --> 5474.5199999999995
right at the time when the flying cities

5472.78 --> 5477.04
were there they had like these giant

5474.52 --> 5479.26
death rays which are thought of as nukes

5477.04 --> 5482.86
they're not they're probably just Tesla

5479.26 --> 5485.92
Death Race Tesla Death Race

5482.86 --> 5489.719
and they were like the only thing that

5485.92 --> 5489.719
could destroy them were each other

5497.8 --> 5501.659000000001
what the hell are you talking about

5502.48 --> 5507.04
people believe in many gods every no one

5505.0 --> 5510.9
which is the right one

5507.04 --> 5510.9
well you know it by the patterns

5511.3 --> 5514.06
but

5512.739 --> 5515.739
is not

5514.06 --> 5518.9800000000005
names

5515.739 --> 5522.299999999999
it's not a bunch of words it is the

5518.98 --> 5522.299999999999
esoteric essence

5522.639 --> 5529.06
like all the gods all the pantheon are

5525.52 --> 5531.46
the same type of crystallization

5529.06 --> 5534.52
of the Divine

5531.46 --> 5538.02
they're all sons of God

5534.52 --> 5538.02
patterns yes

5542.679 --> 5546.52
so you could say they're all the right

5544.659 --> 5550.0599999999995
one it's just like what are you

5546.52 --> 5550.96
following what about this God appeals to

5550.06 --> 5553.3
you

5550.96 --> 5556.12
what are you follow it's not about who

5553.3 --> 5559.84
your fault it's what are you following

5556.12 --> 5562.48
you see that's the real question what is

5559.84 --> 5565.0
the essence you pursue

5562.48 --> 5567.839999999999
what are the consequences of the essence

5565.0 --> 5567.84
you pursue

5571.92 --> 5578.7390000000005
soon is the creator of life this is just

5575.739 --> 5578.739
rehearing

5610.84 --> 5617.52
doesn't it say in the Bible what what

5614.8 --> 5617.52
are you talking about

5626.679 --> 5628.86
foreign

5629.639 --> 5634.08
what are you talking about Moonshadow

5635.86 --> 5639.759999999999
there's like three minutes in between

5637.96 --> 5643.5
your messages

5639.76 --> 5643.5
like what are you talking about

5673.3 --> 5679.320000000001
what the hell is there now two moon

5675.76 --> 5679.320000000001
Shadows what the hell is this [ __ ]

5679.48 --> 5682.86
are you talking to yourself

5695.76 --> 5704.679
which is God created at the Big Bang

5699.58 --> 5709.26
now that's Satan that's the king of Lies

5704.679 --> 5709.26
it's a lie big bag is a lie

5738.28 --> 5741.759999999999
because wow

5743.86 --> 5746.04
foreign

5764.8 --> 5769.5
the world was a big mining operation

5772.48 --> 5775.5599999999995
of a sprinter to come

5776.08 --> 5783.36
this is the concrete to build

5779.5 --> 5783.36
enhance anomaly what

5785.38 --> 5789.36
the mining operation for what

5803.02 --> 5810.96
if it was such a great mining operation

5805.36 --> 5810.96
then they missed a spot as in everything

5819.04 --> 5824.4
I mean there's been a lot of mining in

5822.04 --> 5824.4
the world

5825.1 --> 5831.639
but who's to say that we were like

5827.38 --> 5836.08
excavated that we were strip-minded

5831.639 --> 5837.82
by an outside realm or something what

5836.08 --> 5841.98
how do you know that

5837.82 --> 5841.98
I mean maybe another realm segment

5843.46 --> 5848.26
I guess

5845.76 --> 5851.56
pre-atlantean colonization or something

5848.26 --> 5853.119000000001
I don't know man it could be

5851.56 --> 5855.280000000001
you know

5853.119 --> 5857.739
if it's not your Realm

5855.28 --> 5860.139
you're less likely to really give a [ __ ]

5857.739 --> 5863.5599999999995
it's just like no just strip it off sure

5860.139 --> 5866.1990000000005
but that's like so long ago

5863.56 --> 5869.56
we don't even have a trace of a hint of

5866.199 --> 5873.839999999999
what was what it was like then

5869.56 --> 5873.84
like the flood happened since then so

5878.26 --> 5882.659000000001
right we just know there's pyramids

5882.82 --> 5887.759999999999
and we know they were serving a function

5893.44 --> 5897.879999999999
do you think caves can lead to other

5896.08 --> 5900.34
worlds who knows

5897.88 --> 5902.82
or other worlds is kind of a big word

5900.34 --> 5902.82
for it

5907.48 --> 5913.599999999999
but yeah sure I think there's probably a

5909.82 --> 5917.04
really big Subterranean Realm

5913.6 --> 5917.04
down there somewhere

5924.45 --> 5930.82
[Music]

5926.82 --> 5934.92
no no you wouldn't know God

5930.82 --> 5934.92
in order to make that statement

5936.1 --> 5941.26
that's taking the lord's name in vain

5938.38 --> 5944.400000000001
like you don't know him in order to say

5941.26 --> 5944.400000000001
that you dummy

5951.699 --> 5954.299999999999
hmm

5966.82 --> 5972.04
3D printed

5968.98 --> 5976.36
well it would see no I disagree with

5972.04 --> 5978.46
that not 3D printed but there was

5976.36 --> 5980.619
probably Stone molded technology

5978.46 --> 5984.4
involved

5980.619 --> 5987.36
it was like a cast process I think

5984.4 --> 5987.36
a lot of it

5987.46 --> 5991.56
the 3D printed

5992.619 --> 5997.0599999999995
well maybe it might have seemed very

5995.08 --> 6000.239
similar to that

5997.06 --> 6002.76
like with the the Limestone Parts yeah

6000.239 --> 6004.86
it could have actually been 3D printed

6002.76 --> 6007.56
but there's also

6004.86 --> 6010.98
the the stones inside of the pyramid

6007.56 --> 6012.780000000001
like on the inside a lot of them they

6010.98 --> 6015.5
can have been printed there they like

6012.78 --> 6018.659
show the

6015.5 --> 6022.739
the natural

6018.659 --> 6026.78
Rock nerves like that's not printed when

6022.739 --> 6026.78
it's printed it becomes just a mesh

6027.36 --> 6033.0
you don't have the natural patterns of

6030.659 --> 6035.82
the rock anymore

6033.0 --> 6038.1
pink granite and all that right

6035.82 --> 6041.699
so

6038.1 --> 6045.9800000000005
yeah there was a lot of stone

6041.699 --> 6045.98
a lot of stone casting getting involved

6046.02 --> 6048.7390000000005
but

6048.96 --> 6053.34
it wasn't I don't think it was just

6051.239 --> 6055.58
literally or printed like we think of

6053.34 --> 6055.58
now

6060.6 --> 6066.42
could there be a hidden land down below

6063.06 --> 6068.1
eight miles where we they won't let us

6066.42 --> 6070.8
dig no

6068.1 --> 6072.06
no they'll let us dig everywhere it's

6070.8 --> 6074.52
just that

6072.06 --> 6077.219
there might be other stuff down there as

6074.52 --> 6080.6
well right

6077.219 --> 6083.46
so is there some kind of subterranean

6080.6 --> 6087.659000000001
treaty like the Antarctic treaty no

6083.46 --> 6089.52
there isn't you can actually do it

6087.659 --> 6092.28
There's issues

6089.52 --> 6094.860000000001
and besides it's really creepy leaving

6092.28 --> 6098.46
Earth's surface leaving the Sun and then

6094.86 --> 6101.299999999999
just going for miles and miles in giant

6098.46 --> 6101.3
cave systems

6102.78 --> 6108.9
like what is it

6105.719 --> 6110.639
beneath Bulgaria was it

6108.9 --> 6113.04
in that region

6110.639 --> 6115.38
there's like giant cave systems they

6113.04 --> 6117.48
still haven't found the the bottom of

6115.38 --> 6120.08
them

6117.48 --> 6120.08
so

6123.119 --> 6128.88
I don't think people are prohibited from

6126.119 --> 6131.339999999999
going there it's just that

6128.88 --> 6133.52
they need to be informed if you go in

6131.34 --> 6133.52
there

6134.219 --> 6138.36
for just in case you get lost or

6136.8 --> 6140.46
something

6138.36 --> 6143.46
right they're still they have

6140.46 --> 6145.32
responsibility for the people they let

6143.46 --> 6148.02
explore the cave

6145.32 --> 6149.82
so there's the liability issues ETC so

6148.02 --> 6151.320000000001
yeah but they're not really forbidding

6149.82 --> 6153.0599999999995
it then there would just be a treaty

6151.32 --> 6155.219
like yeah you just don't go there it's

6153.06 --> 6159.1990000000005
not allowed or you get the military

6155.219 --> 6159.199
after you well that's not happening

6161.1 --> 6165.679
the bottom of the world maybe arrest

6163.139 --> 6165.679
dude

6167.76 --> 6170.360000000001
nothing

6171.679 --> 6177.679
volumetric limited space it will

6174.239 --> 6177.678999999999
literally be resting on nothing

6178.679 --> 6185.6990000000005
like the end of volume for material to

6183.3 --> 6188.719
to enter

6185.699 --> 6188.719
that's what I think

6197.34 --> 6204.02
the flood was to cover the kit what kind

6200.58 --> 6204.0199999999995
of a conclusion is that

6205.08 --> 6211.04
that's ridiculous

6207.48 --> 6211.04
they're not covered up

6211.08 --> 6213.92
they aren't

6220.26 --> 6225.719
I mean

6221.54 --> 6230.119
the pyramids around the world could be

6225.719 --> 6230.119
considered to have been covered up right

6231.3 --> 6235.1990000000005
they were probably disabled in what they

6233.639 --> 6238.56
were doing because of the flood but

6235.199 --> 6241.678999999999
caves no no they're not covered up

6238.56 --> 6244.1
they've been found they're not all oh

6241.679 --> 6246.4800000000005
look there's like

6244.1 --> 6248.219
lots of mods that we have to dig out

6246.48 --> 6250.0199999999995
first no it's just like oh hey they're

6248.219 --> 6254.219
the case holy [ __ ] they're really deep

6250.02 --> 6258.719
so no flood definitely not to cover up

6254.219 --> 6258.719
the caves that's really no

6265.98 --> 6270.9
tooth materials get more dense as you

6269.34 --> 6273.06
dig down into the Earth because of

6270.9 --> 6275.4
relative density no

6273.06 --> 6276.6
not necessarily but they do get more

6275.4 --> 6279.42
compacted

6276.6 --> 6281.639
right it's not all liquid

6279.42 --> 6283.5
so it doesn't have maneuvering room it

6281.639 --> 6286.619
the density

6283.5 --> 6288.54
this equilibrium might be happening but

6286.619 --> 6291.0599999999995
it has no maneuvering room so it's just

6288.54 --> 6294.8
stuck in between all the pressures down

6291.06 --> 6294.8
there it's not going to go anywhere

6302.639 --> 6308.88
maybe like gases or something or

6306.119 --> 6311.099999999999
whatever liquids they might like Escape

6308.88 --> 6314.159000000001
over time or sip through or something

6311.1 --> 6317.159000000001
but yeah the solids are just sitting

6314.159 --> 6318.48
there they are not ordered by their

6317.159 --> 6322.099999999999
density because they don't have

6318.48 --> 6322.099999999999
maneuvering room it's just there

6329.88 --> 6337.639
yeah that's really pathetic Bad Karma

6333.36 --> 6337.639
Charles Darwin is a complete [ __ ]

6338.699 --> 6343.32
like the worst

6340.98 --> 6345.54
one of the worst characters in the

6343.32 --> 6348.119
entire history

6345.54 --> 6351.3
of atheism and materialism Charles

6348.119 --> 6353.28
Darwin is like the worst and that's

6351.3 --> 6355.139
saying something because there's a

6353.28 --> 6358.5599999999995
really shitty characters that have

6355.139 --> 6361.1990000000005
championed it Charles Darwin is the

6358.56 --> 6364.02
worst of them in my opinion not

6361.199 --> 6367.44
necessarily the strongest just the the

6364.02 --> 6367.4400000000005
most depraved

6383.9 --> 6390.179999999999
Turtles all the way down no

6386.94 --> 6390.179999999999
[Music]

6392.88 --> 6395.0
all right

6395.51 --> 6401.54
[Music]

6405.32 --> 6412.08
now things like oh Turtles underneath

6408.06 --> 6414.900000000001
Turtles underneath that's all just to

6412.08 --> 6417.42
to accommodate for the lack of

6414.9 --> 6419.46
imagination that people have in order to

6417.42 --> 6423.36
grasp

6419.46 --> 6426.26
what it well my opinion inevitably will

6423.36 --> 6426.259999999999
turn out to be

6426.48 --> 6431.78
I think that

6428.699 --> 6434.099999999999
after everything is actually measured

6431.78 --> 6437.04
which will probably not happen in

6434.1 --> 6439.7390000000005
another thousand years huh

6437.04 --> 6442.679
I'm still gonna try to predict it I

6439.739 --> 6445.5599999999995
think the entire Earth around like the

6442.679 --> 6448.38
entirety of it and any Realms beyond

6445.56 --> 6450.900000000001
that we haven't discovered yet they are

6448.38 --> 6453.84
all gonna turn out to be inside of a

6450.9 --> 6457.159
giant Cube

6453.84 --> 6461.159000000001
and the faces of the cube

6457.159 --> 6463.259999999999
are literally the limitation of physical

6461.159 --> 6465.839999999999
matter volume

6463.26 --> 6467.88
like that you literally cannot

6465.84 --> 6470.58
physically move Beyond no matter what

6467.88 --> 6473.88
you do so it's all stuck in this

6470.58 --> 6475.679
simulatory giant Cube that's what I

6473.88 --> 6477.9800000000005
think it's going to turn out to be in

6475.679 --> 6477.9800000000005
the end

6484.739 --> 6491.339999999999
and whether that cube is looping could

6488.4 --> 6494.638999999999
be but I know there's going to be an

6491.34 --> 6497.9400000000005
absolute volumetric limit to the space

6494.639 --> 6500.639
in which matter can move and that's

6497.94 --> 6502.5599999999995
going to be the ultimate condition for

6500.639 --> 6505.619
existence in the realm

6502.56 --> 6507.900000000001
that there is a limitation an absolute

6505.619 --> 6509.88
limitation to the volume in which matter

6507.9 --> 6512.04
can exist

6509.88 --> 6514.9400000000005
and that limitation will never be

6512.04 --> 6514.94
violated ever

6518.01 --> 6521.189
[Music]

6531.0 --> 6536.179
many ideas on the mud flood who caused

6534.0 --> 6536.179
it

6539.06 --> 6547.02
it's probably cymatics related

6543.44 --> 6549.178999999999
liquefaction it's very likely that the

6547.02 --> 6550.7390000000005
entire mud flood event relates to

6549.179 --> 6553.08
liquefaction

6550.739 --> 6556.82
now whether this was naturally induced

6553.08 --> 6556.82
or accidentally triggered

6558.3 --> 6561.42
right

6559.679 --> 6565.5
I don't know

6561.42 --> 6568.1990000000005
it might have been a weapons application

6565.5 --> 6572.099
like okay we're going to cymatically

6568.199 --> 6574.32
vibrate these areas to [ __ ] in the hopes

6572.099 --> 6576.659000000001
we can take it over

6574.32 --> 6579.179
right or

6576.659 --> 6580.92
they simply tried out technology and

6579.179 --> 6583.92
then accidentally

6580.92 --> 6587.099
cymatic vibrations like

6583.92 --> 6588.9
maybe they try to use like sound to

6587.099 --> 6590.9400000000005
create energy or something and then it

6588.9 --> 6594.179
went out of control

6590.94 --> 6596.5199999999995
right it could have been like even the

6594.179 --> 6599.34
same thing that caused the flood in the

6596.52 --> 6601.679
first place during the Atlantean age

6599.34 --> 6603.900000000001
that they tried to kind of do it again

6601.679 --> 6606.659
and they ended up with a similar result

6603.9 --> 6609.119
except instead of the entire Place being

6606.659 --> 6611.638999999999
flooded which is probably a one-time

6609.119 --> 6615.0599999999995
occasion because I think that it's

6611.639 --> 6617.82
coming down it came down from a realm

6615.06 --> 6620.6990000000005
layer above

6617.82 --> 6623.699
and that realm should be completely void

6620.699 --> 6626.58
of water now because it's all in here

6623.699 --> 6629.4
or maybe it built up back up again

6626.58 --> 6631.26
however yeah

6629.4 --> 6634.46
I don't know there's all kinds of

6631.26 --> 6634.46
possibilities I think

6636.38 --> 6642.3
that liquefaction is the definitive

6639.78 --> 6644.759999999999
cause of the mud flood

6642.3 --> 6647.46
now how that is triggered

6644.76 --> 6650.639
is still up for speculation there are

6647.46 --> 6654.0
many trains of thinking though about it

6650.639 --> 6657.179
but none of them are like definitive

6654.0 --> 6659.219
it's still kind of a wild territory to

6657.179 --> 6660.42
figure out like how did that really

6659.219 --> 6663.36
happen

6660.42 --> 6665.58
was it a natural event or was it an

6663.36 --> 6668.94
accidentally triggered event or was it

6665.58 --> 6672.0599999999995
an on-purpose triggered event

6668.94 --> 6675.9
to destroy regions and try to take it

6672.06 --> 6678.0
over was it in a terror an imperial

6675.9 --> 6681.239
starting move right could have been

6678.0 --> 6683.099
right it was the time

6681.239 --> 6685.138999999999
like

6683.099 --> 6687.56
you know what I mean there was like

6685.139 --> 6687.56
Empire

6688.699 --> 6696.299999999999
's colonization

6692.099 --> 6699.360000000001
there was a lot of that like in its peak

6696.3 --> 6702.719
supposedly when the mud flood happened

6699.36 --> 6704.4
mud floods are like with who knows I

6702.719 --> 6706.02
don't know what that that's why I'm

6704.4 --> 6708.48
saying like it could be several things

6706.02 --> 6711.96
it could be natural it could be

6708.48 --> 6713.759999999999
an accidental technology

6711.96 --> 6716.04
disaster or it could have been on

6713.76 --> 6717.179
purpose I don't know could be any of

6716.04 --> 6718.92
those

6717.179 --> 6721.099
right but I'm gonna round out the show

6718.92 --> 6721.099
now

6721.739 --> 6727.5599999999995
it's interesting subjects to end with

6724.92 --> 6729.4800000000005
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6727.56 --> 6731.6990000000005
like this show if you did then please

6729.48 --> 6733.44
don't forget to rogans it up and if you

Chat and the membership system join

6747.84 --> 6753.599
button that will be much appreciated and

6751.08 --> 6756.38
again thanks for the support

6753.599 --> 6756.38
today

6756.8 --> 6761.3
from

6758.58 --> 6761.3
it again

6761.82 --> 6765.659
yeah

6763.92 --> 6767.46
there's a lot of chat I can't find it

6765.659 --> 6770.339999999999
back but thanks for the support guys I

6767.46 --> 6772.7390000000005
thought PJ cruiseshank and Tony Whitcomb

6770.34 --> 6776.96
