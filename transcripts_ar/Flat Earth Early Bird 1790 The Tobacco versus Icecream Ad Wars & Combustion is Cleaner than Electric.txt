yesterday I slept really good because I

434.039 --> 437.36
overslept

436.22 --> 442.84000000000003
[Music]

437.36 --> 445.52000000000004
like what is it it's a half past 2 so

442.84 --> 447.87899999999996
yeah there was no point in doing a show

445.52 --> 447.87899999999996
after

448.319 --> 453.759
that

450.599 --> 455.759
but I did go on uh fed pre-show and all

453.759 --> 460.28000000000003
that

455.759 --> 462.319
so but uh it has been like

460.28 --> 466.55999999999995
tumultuous a

462.319 --> 468.36
bit also because well friend from called

466.56 --> 469.72
and apparently one of her friends is

468.36 --> 473.72
like

469.72 --> 475.24
dying just really hard on her and

473.72 --> 479.72
everything

475.24 --> 483.28000000000003
but just at this look have you guys seen

479.72 --> 485.59900000000005
like the view count on my video from

483.28 --> 488.039
Sunday it's

485.599 --> 490.56
crazy and it's all

488.039 --> 495.28
trolls for some reason there's like a

490.56 --> 499.24
whole bunch of hate fans just piled onto

495.28 --> 500.63899999999995
it mostly because I in my rage win I

499.24 --> 504.0
kind of

500.639 --> 506.199
foolishly well pull in the kids and I

504.0 --> 510.759
that wasn't just

506.199 --> 512.839
a a judgment mistake

510.759 --> 516.24
and it happened because I was pretty

512.839 --> 519.479
damn pissed off and I was trying to hold

516.24 --> 521.08
back but yeah when it glows hot enough

519.479 --> 524.039
you just

521.08 --> 526.44
like I just grab I saw it I grabbed it I

524.039 --> 526.4399999999999
didn't

527.76 --> 535.0
think that that's really harsh and all

531.32 --> 538.0
that but it

535.0 --> 542.36
yeah the crazy thing about it is that it

538.0 --> 544.68
was actually based on real serious

542.36 --> 547.8000000000001
concern it's just yeah when you're

544.68 --> 550.279
raging with that really serious concern

547.8 --> 553.1999999999999
just like completely flips inside out

550.279 --> 555.959
and it's just freaking ugly so it was a

553.2 --> 557.279
serious judgment mistake on my part and

555.959 --> 561.88
I

557.279 --> 563.68
apologize well to my viewers because

561.88 --> 566.48
they're the ones that actually have to

563.68 --> 567.3599999999999
endure these freaking trolls now and

566.48 --> 569.72
they

567.36 --> 572.76
have like

569.72 --> 576.519
Expedition truth

572.76 --> 576.519
here and blue pill

576.92 --> 580.5999999999999
Devolution and I want to apologize to

579.56 --> 584.4399999999999
you

580.6 --> 587.6
guys for my lap of judgment and now you

584.44 --> 589.2
having to like indirectly deal with that

587.6 --> 592.16
and I'm

589.2 --> 596.9200000000001
like I'm relieved that you're

592.16 --> 600.7199999999999
not sick of it cuz in a way I

596.92 --> 603.92
am you know I am trying to work on this

600.72 --> 607.6800000000001
control thing with the rage win

603.92 --> 609.8
but it's a very tricky thing to

607.68 --> 613.4799999999999
control right because a little bit of

609.8 --> 617.279
rage is very easy to control but if it

613.48 --> 617.279
really especially if it's

617.64 --> 624.519
sudden like a Brit

620.16 --> 630.64
Trail it it makes it very hard to

624.519 --> 633.76
control a studio yeah to you too right

630.64 --> 636.6
however I've actually been thinking

633.76 --> 641.04
carefully and who I'm not going to

636.6 --> 643.6800000000001
apologize to is freaking flat

641.04 --> 645.88
soid especially the way that he

643.68 --> 649.68
responded I really think he was going to

645.88 --> 652.959
take the take the gemstone and just be

649.68 --> 652.959
the bigger man but

653.16 --> 656.7199999999999
no no no

658.04 --> 662.1999999999999
no

660.2 --> 663.839
so hey if he's not going to take it that

662.2 --> 667.12
serious well then I'm not going to take

663.839 --> 667.12
it that serious either you

670.72 --> 676.72
know and hey my rage was over the top

674.279 --> 676.72
but the

677.16 --> 683.7199999999999
concerns were

681.44 --> 687.0
legitimate if you hang around with

683.72 --> 689.519
really trashy people it radiates right

687.0 --> 691.68
onto your family and your children

689.519 --> 693.519
especially your children you think like

691.68 --> 696.519
oh just because they're not with their

693.519 --> 698.12
attention there it's not yeah but you

696.519 --> 702.36
have it in

698.12 --> 705.24
you and so that becomes you to your

702.36 --> 708.6
children that Radiance it will normalize

705.24 --> 711.48
it to them and then they're more

708.6 --> 712.6800000000001
vulnerable to get involved with really

711.48 --> 715.36
[ __ ] up

712.68 --> 718.079
people and that's actually what I was

715.36 --> 721.839
sort of trying to warn about but yeah

718.079 --> 723.5999999999999
was just what the [ __ ] get it was just

721.839 --> 727.2790000000001
it came out completely [ __ ]

723.6 --> 727.279
basically like a like a

727.68 --> 734.2399999999999
caveman but I just wanted to share that

731.04 --> 737.0
there was a very serious underlying

734.24 --> 737.0
thought behind

747.12 --> 754.12
it was my comment on his exotic sounding

750.399 --> 755.959
accent yeah but I don't even want to get

754.12 --> 758.8
into like oh he's a special boy or

755.959 --> 761.7199999999999
something but I mean it's not like he's

758.8 --> 765.399
working on it or

761.72 --> 768.48
anything I pay attention a lot to

765.399 --> 772.72
pronounciation and I've noticed that it

768.48 --> 777.44
seems very much at times he on purpose

772.72 --> 780.9590000000001
lets lets it slip up like lets it

777.44 --> 783.48
africanize he does it on purpose I can

780.959 --> 787.399
tell because I am like have

783.48 --> 789.72
detail sensories about that I pay a lot

787.399 --> 792.48
of attention to pronunciation I do that

789.72 --> 795.12
because I'm fascinated with it almost

792.48 --> 798.32
obsessed because I was like really

795.12 --> 802.279
trained in it when I was young it's like

798.32 --> 804.399
really trained like always pronounced

802.279 --> 806.68
like almost get punished if you don't

804.399 --> 809.48
take it

806.68 --> 811.16
serious right so

809.48 --> 813.48
I just have a lot of attention and I

811.16 --> 816.92
noticed that like yeah you're flopping

813.48 --> 819.839
you're just africanizing because oh

816.92 --> 822.7199999999999
makes you

819.839 --> 825.72
exotic sort of like an exotic

822.72 --> 825.72
white

828.44 --> 832.839
right you're doing

833.16 --> 839.199
yeah I don't want to I don't want to

835.839 --> 841.8800000000001
clown around with it I kind of want to

839.199 --> 844.8389999999999
leave this [ __ ] behind me I mean

841.88 --> 846.079
floid I feel like he's basically just

844.839 --> 849.48
trolled

846.079 --> 851.6389999999999
me and he wants to just go raging back

849.48 --> 854.279
and forth or something he just wants me

851.639 --> 857.36
to do and I'm not going to do that you

854.279 --> 859.8389999999999
know I spend a lot of time avoiding

857.36 --> 862.639
trash even though they always put it on

859.839 --> 867.36
my doorstep

862.639 --> 869.12
dig so if I'm just going to like oh I'm

867.36 --> 872.0
going to do his accent again or

869.12 --> 874.24
something it's just going to play into

872.0 --> 874.24
that

879.0 --> 883.32
more yeah it's it's just

886.639 --> 892.72
true no but I don't really want to call

889.48 --> 896.24
him out ter I don't need to call him out

892.72 --> 900.24
okay Q is already called them

896.24 --> 902.9590000000001
out Q is already said like months ago

900.24 --> 902.9590000000001
like he's a

904.92 --> 910.7199999999999
clown he's messing up big time sometimes

907.839 --> 913.2790000000001
he gets it right right if you can if you

910.72 --> 916.0790000000001
can make out what he's saying it's more

913.279 --> 919.16
like oh you recognize what he's

916.079 --> 921.0
saying if you wouldn't recognize what he

919.16 --> 922.48
was saying you wouldn't even make out

921.0 --> 925.48
what he's

922.48 --> 925.48
saying

927.6 --> 930.6
so

935.199 --> 938.92
it's

936.6 --> 940.759
just I don't need to call him out I

938.92 --> 944.56
don't want to call him out he said some

940.759 --> 946.88
really just gross things

944.56 --> 949.279
and like I don't want to have anything

946.88 --> 952.0
to do with

949.279 --> 952.3
that it's all just fun and games to him

952.0 --> 955.47
you

952.3 --> 955.4699999999999
[Music]

957.6 --> 960.6
know

960.68 --> 966.92
besides I don't want to poke at like

963.92 --> 970.56
flat Sid's penist

966.92 --> 973.199
either I mean those guys are just

970.56 --> 976.04
getting all worked up and all that I

973.199 --> 978.8
don't want to do that I like his fan

976.04 --> 981.88
lists but they every time this happens

978.8 --> 984.399
they always like do that I don't care I

981.88 --> 987.519
don't think it really matters I mean

984.399 --> 990.319
what were they're going to hold a grudge

987.519 --> 992.88
why you're not going to be in the same

990.319 --> 994.519
room with me

992.88 --> 997.12
okay

994.519 --> 999.44
whatever I mean I hold nothing against

997.12 --> 1003.279
you I get it that you really thought it

999.44 --> 1006.48
was distasteful or whatever yeah sure I

1003.279 --> 1009.4399999999999
basically gave recognition to that but

1006.48 --> 1013.12
hey if you don't want

1009.44 --> 1015.0790000000001
to hear my apology or my insights as to

1013.12 --> 1017.48
why that even happened then yeah that's

1015.079 --> 1020.16
your

1017.48 --> 1022.6800000000001
problem I don't want to agitate things

1020.16 --> 1025.36
any further I'm already freaking

1022.68 --> 1029.12
agitated enough that that Flat's just

1025.36 --> 1032.9589999999998
hanging with troll scumbags in the first

1029.12 --> 1035.52
place and hey I already had my

1032.959 --> 1037.919
reaction besid verbally like I'm just

1035.52 --> 1039.679
not going to be hanging in his chat and

1037.919 --> 1041.48
following his show anymore it's just

1039.679 --> 1043.919
like no I'm done with

1041.48 --> 1047.4
this it's not worth it

1043.919 --> 1051.3200000000002
anymore and that'll solve the

1047.4 --> 1051.3200000000002
problem most of

1060.919 --> 1067.72
it what Q has said that no he has not

1064.12 --> 1071.1599999999999
said his accent is not real oh he is

1067.72 --> 1071.16
South African that is the

1077.28 --> 1082.0
accent what where are you getting that

1079.2 --> 1082.0
from

1083.48 --> 1089.0
teret are you having a massive delay on

1086.24 --> 1089.0
the video or

1096.08 --> 1101.72
something oh yeah hey red Danny you were

1099.039 --> 1104.1589999999999
in complete shock when I heard that yeah

1101.72 --> 1108.84
I get

1104.159 --> 1112.0800000000002
that and in a way it was kind of on

1108.84 --> 1115.08
purpose in that moment through Rin it

1112.08 --> 1118.76
was just like yeah shock

1115.08 --> 1121.799
him because I saw an actual threat there

1118.76 --> 1123.36
to it it's

1121.799 --> 1126.4
like

1123.36 --> 1128.52
complicated I'm very I would be very

1126.4 --> 1131.1200000000001
extremely protective of my children and

1128.52 --> 1134.24
I think flat soid is too but I think

1131.12 --> 1135.9599999999998
it's just slipping because you need to

1134.24 --> 1138.799
protect them

1135.96 --> 1141.24
morally you need to protect yourself so

1138.799 --> 1145.36
that whatever you're doing it doesn't

1141.24 --> 1149.72
ooze out onto them it's not about

1145.36 --> 1149.7199999999998
knowing it's about what you carry in

1152.32 --> 1157.4399999999998
you right you can't just not tell your

1155.0 --> 1159.559
kids and then expect it not to have an

1157.44 --> 1163.559
influence on them it

1159.559 --> 1166.039
will and so in that sense I

1163.559 --> 1168.36
worry and that's why I did it it's just

1166.039 --> 1171.24
like the the most extremely

1168.36 --> 1172.4799999999998
inappropriate way to do that to convey

1171.24 --> 1175.84
that

1172.48 --> 1178.4
worry but I mean yeah I was pissed off

1175.84 --> 1180.33
so I'm sh I'm sorry to have shocked you

1178.4 --> 1184.24
all like

1180.33 --> 1186.0
[Music]

1184.24 --> 1190.6
that

1186.0 --> 1192.679
I it's definitely not going to be normal

1190.6 --> 1196.4399999999998
or considered

1192.679 --> 1198.4
normal and like I would never like even

1196.44 --> 1201.64
think like unless I was really like I

1198.4 --> 1204.679
want to get in a fight I would never say

1201.64 --> 1206.0200000000002
that to somebody's face that's

1204.679 --> 1209.48
crazy

1206.02 --> 1212.28
[Music]

1209.48 --> 1214.2
like but maybe in that moment I kind of

1212.28 --> 1217.6399999999999
did want to like get into a fight I'm

1214.2 --> 1221.44
like yeah I'm [ __ ] sick of this like

1217.64 --> 1223.0800000000002
I don't have kids he has and then he

1221.44 --> 1225.48
hangs around with

1223.08 --> 1228.76
[ __ ] and like I'm doing my best

1225.48 --> 1231.159
being exemplary not having kids

1228.76 --> 1233.799
and he has kids and he's just doing that

1231.159 --> 1233.7990000000002
and I'm

1234.84 --> 1241.52
[Music]

1237.08 --> 1245.799
like like yeah I mean it gets me

1241.52 --> 1248.039
primally aggressive in a way envious you

1245.799 --> 1248.039
could

1248.36 --> 1255.24
say but not to a way that oh I want to

1251.6 --> 1256.6399999999999
pull him down to my state or whatever

1255.24 --> 1259.6
it's just

1256.64 --> 1262.2800000000002
that I just don't really think

1259.6 --> 1265.1699999999998
constructively that much anymore because

1262.28 --> 1269.279
of the Envy

1265.17 --> 1271.64
[Music]

1269.279 --> 1274.64
influence I don't know it's just really

1271.64 --> 1278.0800000000002
important to me that parents especially

1274.64 --> 1280.72
dads are like really

1278.08 --> 1284.9189999999999
Noble like men have to be Noble if you

1280.72 --> 1284.919
have kids especially you just have to

1287.039 --> 1290.039
be

1290.91 --> 1295.44
[Music]

1292.76 --> 1297.17
it was all manufactured to get my is

1295.44 --> 1301.779
yeah probably

1297.17 --> 1301.779
[Music]

1302.0 --> 1306.919
Tommy the Jamie guy really tried to get

1305.12 --> 1309.9189999999999
in my face

1306.919 --> 1309.919
too

1312.0 --> 1318.64
so whatever it is it's just dirty

1314.799 --> 1320.799
disgusting business and it is r an level

1318.64 --> 1322.5590000000002
and I want absolutely nothing to do with

1320.799 --> 1325.559
it and

1322.559 --> 1328.1589999999999
exactly in that time when I started to

1325.559 --> 1330.72
realize that about ranty that he was

1328.159 --> 1334.8400000000001
trash and that he liked to hang around

1330.72 --> 1337.88
trash and oozed off him I said I don't

1334.84 --> 1340.6599999999999
want to have anything to do with it

1337.88 --> 1346.189
anymore and I'm doing the same

1340.66 --> 1346.189
[Music]

1346.96 --> 1349.96
now

1351.72 --> 1357.3600000000001
whatever I said it would have been the

1353.88 --> 1357.3600000000001
same could be

1357.88 --> 1364.3600000000001
Tommy they they probably would have

1360.279 --> 1366.72
found something to be outraged

1364.36 --> 1369.1589999999999
about right but that's why I'm not

1366.72 --> 1373.52

[Music]

1462.03 --> 1465.1499999999999

1465.32 --> 1470.76
way I feel bit weird by the way but

1467.88 --> 1475.3600000000001
because I ate a lot like

1470.76 --> 1477.679
I I made like NY fuong High which and

1475.36 --> 1482.0
it's been like 2 years since I had that

1477.679 --> 1485.3200000000002
last like or even more long time ago I

1482.0 --> 1490.35
made it

1485.32 --> 1491.52
uh did I make it yeah two days ago

1490.35 --> 1495.1999999999998
[Music]

1491.52 --> 1498.2
Sunday and like basically had three

1495.2 --> 1501.44
portions but yesterday I ate it really

1498.2 --> 1504.279
early like in the afternoon and didn't

1501.44 --> 1507.72
have lunch and then later at night I was

1504.279 --> 1509.799
like I'm hungry I'm going to just

1507.72 --> 1512.72
freaking eat this whole meal it's going

1509.799 --> 1517.44
to fit and it did

1512.72 --> 1522.52
fit so but I've like I'm a bit full

1517.44 --> 1525.0
still but okay but it's a bit weird I

1522.52 --> 1525.72
yeah I haven't just had this much to eat

1525.0 --> 1530.799
like

1525.72 --> 1530.799
in in five years or

1531.84 --> 1538.9599999999998
something but it's

1534.83 --> 1542.52
[Music]

1538.96 --> 1542.52
good right that

1542.58 --> 1549.529
[Music]

1550.12 --> 1555.84
happened yeah the my friend from name

1553.12 --> 1559.6399999999999
that part she called like yesterday that

1555.84 --> 1562.32
was like heartbreaking man and I already

1559.64 --> 1565.3600000000001
I I feel guilty because I actually

1562.32 --> 1568.1589999999999
predicted that would happen to

1565.36 --> 1572.559
her cuz that guy I I think I even met

1568.159 --> 1572.5590000000002
him one time 10 years ago or

1572.799 --> 1578.44
something and he is like a really

1576.2 --> 1582.559
spirited guy but he's been like made

1578.44 --> 1584.799
very foolish decision including

1582.559 --> 1586.6
medical and what it wasn't his first

1584.799 --> 1591.48
problem he had like drug

1586.6 --> 1592.8799999999999
problems and yeah he's he he got fooled

1591.48 --> 1596.76
in taking the

1592.88 --> 1600.0
shot and it was a bad one and so he has

1596.76 --> 1604.12
like really like he had lung

1600.0 --> 1608.24
problems and now they've like really

1604.12 --> 1612.399
become like continuously painful it's

1608.24 --> 1615.159
[ __ ] up and it's like not like oh a CO

1612.399 --> 1618.08
thing or something although I'm sure

1615.159 --> 1621.88
they're going to designate that it's

1618.08 --> 1624.039
like oh because that would typically be

1621.88 --> 1625.7600000000002
associated with like oh you got real

1624.039 --> 1628.799
trouble breathing real trouble it's like

1625.76 --> 1631.799
really scary could be like oh and that

1628.799 --> 1634.0
could like be a day or even a week or

1631.799 --> 1636.24
that's nothing like this now this is

1634.0 --> 1638.44
like those lungs are like almost

1636.24 --> 1641.36
disintegrating it's [ __ ] up so he's

1638.44 --> 1643.72
like in pain and she's really messed up

1641.36 --> 1647.1589999999999
over it

1643.72 --> 1648.3600000000001
and and she's a really busy single lady

1647.159 --> 1651.2
with a

1648.36 --> 1653.76
K and then this happens and like she's

1651.2 --> 1655.76
in middle of preparing for C classa and

1653.76 --> 1657.44
all that and she wanted him over for

1655.76 --> 1660.32
that and then this happens and he's like

1657.44 --> 1663.519
in the hospital now and it's

1660.32 --> 1666.1589999999999
like it's really

1663.519 --> 1669.6
tragic so yeah the guy had medical

1666.159 --> 1672.92
problems and then he took the shot two

1669.6 --> 1675.9689999999998
years ago and you know how that

1672.92 --> 1675.969
[Music]

1676.519 --> 1679.519
goes

1680.6 --> 1682.9599999999998
yeah it

1683.68 --> 1688.299
[Music]

1706.44 --> 1709.44
sucks

1799.64 --> 1804.24
damn

1800.84 --> 1806.6399999999999
it I glitched sound's gone how long has

1804.24 --> 1806.64
it been

1807.6 --> 1814.399
gone one two minutes

1811.96 --> 1817.519
[ __ ] I'm sorry

1814.399 --> 1819.76
guys yeah where where did I left off

1817.519 --> 1821.76
friend and name our friends were kind of

1819.76 --> 1826.6
like half of our friends

1821.76 --> 1827.8799999999999
from way back they're all like dying or

1826.6 --> 1829.9599999999998
dead

1827.88 --> 1831.679
it's really messed up but it's it's

1829.96 --> 1834.519
because of the types of people she were

1831.679 --> 1839.0
hanging around with and and to be fair

1834.519 --> 1841.519
she knew that she's like she has this

1839.0 --> 1844.0
like over sympathy bleeding heart

1841.519 --> 1846.08
syndrome where it's like somebody that's

1844.0 --> 1847.84
like really messed up and then she like

1846.08 --> 1850.76
falls in love with

1847.84 --> 1854.6789999999999
them

1850.76 --> 1856.8799999999999
because it's it's surreal it's not even

1854.679 --> 1858.8400000000001
like oh they can be better they can be

1856.88 --> 1861.7990000000002
it's not like that it's just

1858.84 --> 1864.1999999999998
that she just kind of becomes obsessed

1861.799 --> 1865.639
with like the flame before it goes out

1864.2 --> 1869.1200000000001
or

1865.639 --> 1873.4399999999998
something it's it's

1869.12 --> 1873.4399999999998
weird but I mean she is kind of

1876.559 --> 1881.279
magical like I can have like

1878.679 --> 1883.5590000000002
conversation with her that are like

1881.279 --> 1887.679
Spirit mechanics to a whole another

1883.559 --> 1890.12
level almost and like she has like all

1887.679 --> 1893.0
effect social effect so she is almost

1890.12 --> 1894.76
like a Layman psychologist like myself

1893.0 --> 1898.519
which is almost like a magician like

1894.76 --> 1901.24
studying how people act and how they

1898.519 --> 1904.6
respond and like estimating their inner

1901.24 --> 1907.24
worlds and all that especially

1904.6 --> 1909.76
concerning conflicts so we can

1907.24 --> 1913.3990000000001
like have just these amazing

1909.76 --> 1913.399
conversations oneon-one over the

1916.159 --> 1920.6000000000001
phone

1918.24 --> 1923.039
and like she's like her kids now going

1920.6 --> 1925.12
to Waldorf School on my recommendation

1923.039 --> 1927.76
by the way which is a real challenge but

1925.12 --> 1931.559
I mean it's a good challenge and she's

1927.76 --> 1932.6
like crushing it like my friend from is

1931.559 --> 1936.32
doing it

1932.6 --> 1938.6789999999999
better than my parents were when I went

1936.32 --> 1940.639
to that school it's like she's making

1938.679 --> 1944.039
some serious

1940.639 --> 1946.519
effort and like my parents did not like

1944.039 --> 1949.679
my parents were good in their own way

1946.519 --> 1951.6
they were good for me or oneon-one it

1949.679 --> 1954.1200000000001
really they were really taking me

1951.6 --> 1958.039
serious personally but out there they

1954.12 --> 1958.039
also had trouble like dealing with other

1958.32 --> 1962.639
people didn't know how to compose

1960.679 --> 1966.159
themselves as a family

1962.639 --> 1968.559
really like hippie dippy

1966.159 --> 1973.0390000000002
syndrome cuz we were kind of hippies in

1968.559 --> 1974.8799999999999
a way in a way but not just full-blown

1973.039 --> 1978.48
or

1974.88 --> 1981.7600000000002
something we didn't have goats

1978.48 --> 1985.679
but hey hey it's I'm not against hippie

1981.76 --> 1988.72
seeking star water I'm not it's I'm

1985.679 --> 1990.0
trying to point at a frequency of being

1988.72 --> 1992.6000000000001
of doing

1990.0 --> 1995.679
things I like

1992.6 --> 1998.9189999999999
hippies I like

1995.679 --> 2000.96
you okay sometimes they can annoy me

1998.919 --> 2005.96
though but I mean a lot of things can

2000.96 --> 2008.519
annoy me es including things I like so

2005.96 --> 2010.96
just

2008.519 --> 2012.799
and I like to diss on them a little it's

2010.96 --> 2016.32
like a sort of Cartman

2012.799 --> 2018.96
syndrome I don't know I was I used to be

2016.32 --> 2023.08
one man I had

2018.96 --> 2027.08
like purple blue red

2023.08 --> 2030.6789999999999
white pants and all that and shirts it

2027.08 --> 2033.24
was like I was a freaking hippie dude so

2030.679 --> 2035.76
and that's why I can this on hippies

2033.24 --> 2038.96
okay because I used to be one and I

2035.76 --> 2038.96
still kind of am

2042.799 --> 2049.839
anyway my

2045.08 --> 2054.0
parents I dress in cashmere oo

2049.839 --> 2054.0
classic hey clutch good to see

2054.079 --> 2059.9190000000003
you sometimes they smell as well just

2057.04 --> 2061.44
kidding what do you mean just kidding

2059.919 --> 2065.5989999999997
they

2061.44 --> 2068.28
do I mean and it's really like I'm a

2065.599 --> 2071.119
hippie that does not smell even though

2068.28 --> 2073.159
yeah I take a shower roughly once a week

2071.119 --> 2075.8790000000004
I wash my feet every day

2073.159 --> 2080.399
though but there's like guys that are

2075.879 --> 2083.2799999999997
like typical happppy and dude yeah they

2080.399 --> 2086.159
smell but it's also just because of what

2083.28 --> 2086.159
they eat and all

2088.24 --> 2095.4399999999996
that like especially certain hippies

2092.04 --> 2097.44
that are vegans they just they're like

2095.44 --> 2099.4
no I have to eat vegan and then have to

2097.44 --> 2101.88
eat that and then they end up eating

2099.4 --> 2105.04
stuff that's like that just stinks that

2101.88 --> 2107.6400000000003
makes them stink I don't know eating

2105.04 --> 2110.64
vegan is really tricky to actually do it

2107.64 --> 2113.64
right I'm not trying

2110.64 --> 2115.48
it garlic yeah but garlic doesn't make

2113.64 --> 2119.7599999999998
you stink like that garlic makes you

2115.48 --> 2119.76
smell like garlic I don't mean

2121.52 --> 2125.56
that like garlic can give you real

2123.8 --> 2128.079
garlic breath or something right but I

2125.56 --> 2130.72
mean that's not that's it's like oh you

2128.079 --> 2133.5600000000004
ate garlic that's not the type of smell

2130.72 --> 2138.5989999999997
I'm talking about like

2133.56 --> 2141.64
just extremely man

2138.599 --> 2144.52
stink and and not like the soy boy man

2141.64 --> 2146.64
stink or whatever like fat gross people

2144.52 --> 2149.8
that eat a lot of chips not that because

2146.64 --> 2151.72
that's just atrocity but still they can

2149.8 --> 2155.8
like just really stin I don't know some

2151.72 --> 2158.7999999999997
women don't mind or something I

2155.8 --> 2158.8
M

2159.48 --> 2166.96
but yeah hippies can

2162.079 --> 2166.96
sneak but I mean it's

2167.839 --> 2171.24
not I don't

2172.72 --> 2179.04
care I prefer the hippie types that are

2175.48 --> 2179.04
not smelly like

2180.76 --> 2187.96
myself but hey I don't have anything

2184.16 --> 2190.68
against you if you do smell just

2187.96 --> 2194.64
you probably don't

2190.68 --> 2198.24
notice let's move on to another

2194.64 --> 2198.24
subject hippies are

2201.94 --> 2205.15
[Music]

2209.48 --> 2215.68
cool they acted like triggered cars what

2212.8 --> 2218.6800000000003
are you guys talking

2215.68 --> 2218.68
about

2219.599 --> 2226.96
right but hey see Star water Garlic's

2224.04 --> 2229.56
great it's just that if you're going to

2226.96 --> 2232.8
eat in raw then don't eat too much of it

2229.56 --> 2234.88
because then it'll like really really

2232.8 --> 2237.7200000000003
smell like garlic so if I like eat

2234.88 --> 2239.48
garlic sauce with raw garlic of course I

2237.72 --> 2242.0
just take one or two

2239.48 --> 2244.599
toes and that's

2242.0 --> 2247.16
plenty but if you like overdo it on the

2244.599 --> 2248.6800000000003
garlic and you like eat that Raw man

2247.16 --> 2253.56
it's going to

2248.68 --> 2253.56
mess it's going to smell like

2258.16 --> 2264.1189999999997
garlic right but by the way actually

2261.24 --> 2268.3999999999996
eating Garlic and even the side effect

2264.119 --> 2270.079
of having being smelly like garlic it is

2268.4 --> 2272.96
actually

2270.079 --> 2275.2400000000002
purifying because it like comes through

2272.96 --> 2277.48
your pores and through your lungs and

2275.24 --> 2281.16
that off gassing of

2277.48 --> 2283.119
that that what's so smelly is actually

2281.16 --> 2286.1189999999997
really

2283.119 --> 2286.119
cleansing

2288.359 --> 2295.24
so somebody smells like

2290.96 --> 2297.44
garlic they're they they like a lot you

2295.24 --> 2300.7999999999997
can be pretty sure that they're they're

2297.44 --> 2303.119
going to be a lot lower on parasites

2300.8 --> 2303.119
after

2303.16 --> 2312.68
that especially intestin parasites

2308.44 --> 2312.68
anyway garlic bread yeah can be

2313.0 --> 2317.76
great garlic rice

2318.72 --> 2325.9199999999996
h 31 watching yeah it's

2323.0 --> 2328.359
good a grow garlic o your own garlic

2325.92 --> 2328.359
that's

2331.839 --> 2338.359
interesting does it grow in really cool

2335.52 --> 2339.7599999999998
environment

2338.359 --> 2341.48
cuz you're like in a pretty cold

2339.76 --> 2344.0
environment

2341.48 --> 2346.2400000000002
right it's always snow in there you're

2344.0 --> 2346.24
always

2353.04 --> 2362.68
ski oh you braid it up and SM smell it

2357.319 --> 2362.68
for days nice and it keeps the vampires

2364.079 --> 2371.28
out it likes cold PL oh I didn't know

2368.8 --> 2371.28
that

2375.0 --> 2378.0
interesting

2379.24 --> 2387.5989999999997
huh what is my opinion on Mineral cell

2383.599 --> 2390.92
salt you mean schler

2387.599 --> 2394.88
salts can it be used to cure

2390.92 --> 2397.64
disease technically yes and yes schler

2394.88 --> 2400.44
salts are pretty astounding it's

2397.64 --> 2404.44
knowledge about salts of the

2400.44 --> 2406.92
body and if you

2404.44 --> 2408.76
approach Health that way in a holistic

2406.92 --> 2411.64
way well you're not even most of the

2408.76 --> 2413.2000000000003
time not even like the what what do you

2411.64 --> 2416.1189999999997
mean

2413.2 --> 2419.48
disease like just get it

2416.119 --> 2422.1600000000003
balanced and then the disease will just

2419.48 --> 2425.16
stop whatever it

2422.16 --> 2425.16
is

2425.359 --> 2428.359
oh

2429.359 --> 2435.839
but yes

2431.16 --> 2435.839
dupons my ex was actually into that

2435.88 --> 2443.88
stuff it's fascinating I trust that it

2440.2 --> 2443.8799999999997
works because it's

2444.88 --> 2450.6800000000003
like yeah the way I said it oh it cures

2447.72 --> 2452.8799999999997
disease it's actually that I do I

2450.68 --> 2457.5989999999997
shouldn't even have to say it like that

2452.88 --> 2460.2000000000003
it's just like if you work on that

2457.599 --> 2463.56
like I don't even see this yeah disease

2460.2 --> 2465.56
cause and effect it's like what is your

2463.56 --> 2468.0
general balance of your body and your

2465.56 --> 2468.7999999999997
state is there a lot of mess to clean up

2468.0 --> 2471.24
if

2468.8 --> 2473.6400000000003
so that's what the disease does the

2471.24 --> 2475.9199999999996
disease is there to clean up the mess

2473.64 --> 2478.64
that's why you're noticing it so

2475.92 --> 2481.0
much and then there's the implications

2478.64 --> 2484.0
through the germano medicine of like why

2481.0 --> 2487.28
it is there why that moment but that's a

2484.0 --> 2490.359
side issue and if you just balance your

2487.28 --> 2494.079
body properly then it will be able to

2490.359 --> 2496.88
fix whatever is going on

2494.079 --> 2500.6400000000003
better it will regenerate

2496.88 --> 2502.44
quicker it will be less toxic right

2500.64 --> 2505.8799999999997
because the more balanced your body is

2502.44 --> 2508.8
the less toxic a side effect will

2505.88 --> 2511.2400000000002
transpire in whatever process is

2508.8 --> 2517.3590000000004
happening including like digestion and

2511.24 --> 2521.04
all that so yeah and cell salts in cell

2517.359 --> 2524.4
salts definitely are meant to play into

2521.04 --> 2524.4
that to help you

2525.119 --> 2530.52
balance

2526.72 --> 2530.52
right undo the

2531.68 --> 2538.44
deficiencies now I don't personally

2534.68 --> 2541.0789999999997
actually use cell salt stuff on

2538.44 --> 2544.319
myself it's never really been necessary

2541.079 --> 2547.559
I felt however I am like totally

2544.319 --> 2549.97
addicted to salt

2547.559 --> 2553.05
especially lacas Sal

2549.97 --> 2553.0499999999997
[Music]

2553.319 --> 2556.319
salt

2557.839 --> 2565.0789999999997
buffering so I am like there was this

2561.119 --> 2567.48
whole idea about salt medically it is

2565.079 --> 2569.4
medically like oh if you have salt it's

2567.48 --> 2572.319
bad for your blood pressure and you get

2569.4 --> 2575.0
guard problems and it's unhealthy and

2572.319 --> 2577.359
ages you like all these things that have

2575.0 --> 2579.599
been said about salt and I'm

2577.359 --> 2582.52
like

2579.599 --> 2585.6800000000003
what I'm not buying

2582.52 --> 2588.2
that because I really like salt my

2585.68 --> 2591.72
grandmother ate salt and that wasn't

2588.2 --> 2593.0
even good salt that was table salt [ __ ]

2591.72 --> 2596.5589999999997
and she would

2593.0 --> 2599.599
like take a spoon of freaking table salt

2596.559 --> 2602.559
and put it on her plate on the food and

2599.599 --> 2603.52
just eat it like holy [ __ ] a lot of

2602.559 --> 2608.0
freaking

2603.52 --> 2610.16
salt and she lived to like in her 90s

2608.0 --> 2612.64
like 97 or something I don't know

2610.16 --> 2615.16
exactly what it was very old so it's

2612.64 --> 2618.2
like yeah not an issues she did not die

2615.16 --> 2620.3999999999996
of heart issues and I love salt I'm

2618.2 --> 2623.16
addicted to salt and I'm able to endure

2620.4 --> 2625.8
it much better and it

2623.16 --> 2629.0
just it's

2625.8 --> 2634.4
great I love salt on my food too I use

2629.0 --> 2634.4
sea salt like uh Celtic Sea

2635.079 --> 2641.119
salt I used to also like the

2639.359 --> 2645.119
uh the

2641.119 --> 2647.96
original Pink Himalayan salt but the

2645.119 --> 2651.44
stuff we get these days is like it's

2647.96 --> 2654.079
like been demineralized in ways so it's

2651.44 --> 2656.28
just it doesn't it's not the same it it

2654.079 --> 2658.44
feels it looks still kind of interesting

2656.28 --> 2660.8
and nice but it's more like table salt

2658.44 --> 2664.04
now actually so I just don't it doesn't

2660.8 --> 2667.76
work it's too salt it doesn't feel that

2664.04 --> 2670.24
great anymore very tragic I bet there's

2667.76 --> 2671.76
still some

2670.24 --> 2675.359
original

2671.76 --> 2677.76
less like purified but not everything

2675.359 --> 2682.319
taken out of it version of it out there

2677.76 --> 2682.3190000000004
but yeah not within the grocery

2683.559 --> 2689.4
stores George k h thanks for link seing

2687.119 --> 2689.4
star

2691.52 --> 2694.96
order but yeah I use plenty of salt on

2694.2 --> 2697.96
my

2694.96 --> 2697.96
food

2698.88 --> 2705.76
and now of course I naturally have low

2702.76 --> 2709.6400000000003
blood pressure that's like genetic with

2705.76 --> 2709.6400000000003
me my dad has that

2710.8 --> 2717.3590000000004
also and he doesn't even eat that much

2713.4 --> 2717.359
salt I don't think he like needs it

2720.92 --> 2725.599
anymore I'm not

2722.839 --> 2728.44
sure but my dad's like really healthy

2725.599 --> 2731.119
diet wise and all that better than I am

2728.44 --> 2733.76
probably like he because he's really

2731.119 --> 2737.119
careful with the way he cooks

2733.76 --> 2740.3590000000004
things it's just I love his cooking he

2737.119 --> 2742.4
like he was the cook in my household

2740.359 --> 2746.0
when I was when I was a

2742.4 --> 2749.48
kid my entire childhood

2746.0 --> 2752.599
great and he's only become better it's

2749.48 --> 2754.68
incredible so yeah I'm looking forward

2752.599 --> 2756.44
already to the Christmas dinner which is

2754.68 --> 2759.16
like an annual event

2756.44 --> 2762.2000000000003
event and then he

2759.16 --> 2765.16
makes uh yeah Christmas dinner which I

2762.2 --> 2767.52
don't know it's usually some kind of

2765.16 --> 2769.3999999999996
chicken we don't really go for the

2767.52 --> 2773.04
turkey we just take

2769.4 --> 2776.04
chicken cuz turkey like makes you drowsy

2773.04 --> 2776.04
it's

2776.92 --> 2782.48
like we've gotten to learn that turkey

2779.96 --> 2784.92
is kind of slightly less healthy than

2782.48 --> 2786.88
chicken I don't know if you agree with

2784.92 --> 2788.559
that or something but

2786.88 --> 2790.839
and like a turkey is always a big

2788.559 --> 2793.44
freaking bird you know and like we're

2790.839 --> 2796.5589999999997
basically having dinner for

2793.44 --> 2799.04
three so a chicken or half a chicken is

2796.559 --> 2801.52
usually

2799.04 --> 2803.079
enough a turkey would just like oh yeah

2801.52 --> 2806.079
we have another week of

2803.079 --> 2806.079
food

2809.359 --> 2812.359
okay

2812.52 --> 2820.839
H for a Gemini rising potassium

2816.76 --> 2824.0400000000004
fluide what are you

2820.839 --> 2826.839
serious because I think that's exactly

2824.04 --> 2826.839
what is in

2831.96 --> 2836.599
here I think that this that is this type

2834.8 --> 2839.28
of salt what you're mentioning there

2836.599 --> 2839.28
Terra that's

2842.0 --> 2847.599
weird and and that makes sense why I'm

2844.839 --> 2850.2
actually able to survive just eating two

2847.599 --> 2852.839
freaking rolls of these in a day and

2850.2 --> 2854.5989999999997
then just doing that like a week and

2852.839 --> 2857.2
then realizing I got to cut down on this

2854.599 --> 2857.2000000000003
this is getting

2858.48 --> 2862.2
scary but I mean when I was younger

2861.0 --> 2864.44
people would say like oh that's

2862.2 --> 2866.5989999999997
dangerous don't eat too much of that and

2864.44 --> 2870.52
then yeah I would eat a roll or half a

2866.599 --> 2873.04
roll and I'd feel sick oh not good oh I

2870.52 --> 2876.64
feel weird and like oh I feel my heart

2873.04 --> 2877.86
beating now I'm just eating like one

2876.64 --> 2879.1189999999997
entire

2877.86 --> 2881.599
[Music]

2879.119 --> 2885.119
roll and it could be like

2881.599 --> 2887.4
within 2 hours and I'm like barely

2885.119 --> 2889.88
flinching it's like

2887.4 --> 2893.2400000000002
yeah I feel

2889.88 --> 2893.2400000000002
good it's

2896.44 --> 2900.96
weird but I mean I think that my body

2899.04 --> 2903.64
just thinks that I work in a salt mine

2900.96 --> 2906.76
or something by

2903.64 --> 2908.96
now and it's just like yep we process

2906.76 --> 2912.2000000000003
salt and I mean my kidneys are crushing

2908.96 --> 2915.2
it dude and this is the weirdest

2912.2 --> 2918.68
thing I have to realize my kidneys are

2915.2 --> 2921.24
crushing it and it's kind of funny

2918.68 --> 2924.9199999999996
because even 10 years

2921.24 --> 2928.2
ago up to 10 years I literally thought

2924.92 --> 2930.76
oh my God my kidneys I had like pain in

2928.2 --> 2933.9199999999996
my kidneys and weird things and I was

2930.76 --> 2936.28
like oh no my kidneys are going to like

2933.92 --> 2938.359
like die on me or something I was really

2936.28 --> 2940.48
afraid of that at times because it it

2938.359 --> 2941.52
got painful in ways and I didn't

2940.48 --> 2944.559
understand it felt like they were

2941.52 --> 2946.839
bloated or something but never like

2944.559 --> 2952.599
excruciatingly painful but just like

2946.839 --> 2952.599
it's always like what's going on here

2953.359 --> 2961.359
agitated since I've started chugging

2958.0 --> 2961.359
these that

2961.64 --> 2966.92
stopped

2963.68 --> 2969.52
yeah I don't know

2966.92 --> 2969.52
it just

2971.64 --> 2979.68
did and it's great my kidneys seem to

2976.44 --> 2982.0
work great they don't

2979.68 --> 2985.24
hurt I have

2982.0 --> 2986.839
less like even like bladder issues

2985.24 --> 2989.16
because of that and all that so it's

2986.839 --> 2994.319
like

2989.16 --> 2994.319
yeah I guess these kidneys run on

2994.52 --> 2999.319
salt

2997.2 --> 3002.64
because why would they always give

2999.319 --> 3004.88
issues until I start chugging

3002.64 --> 3007.52
[Music]

3004.88 --> 3009.799
salt well maybe it's also because I've

3007.52 --> 3012.119
just I'm eating even better now I'm

3009.799 --> 3016.68
eating more

3012.119 --> 3021.0
healthy compared to a while ago no more

3016.68 --> 3021.0
alcohol that could also be a part of

3024.44 --> 3029.559
it so maybe I've just become overall

3027.44 --> 3031.96
healthy but still it's

3029.559 --> 3034.0
just I don't know why I'm able to

3031.96 --> 3036.64
process this much salt and literally

3034.0 --> 3039.119
like have no issues like when I was

3036.64 --> 3042.5589999999997
little or let's say I was 10 or

3039.119 --> 3045.88
something I would like oh keep like eat

3042.559 --> 3050.0
half a roll of this lacol stuff and then

3045.88 --> 3051.76
it would be ow my back hurts it's like

3050.0 --> 3056.079
my kidneys or something like it would

3051.76 --> 3058.44
hurt not really painful but still like m

3056.079 --> 3060.52
I feel like well this is not good like

3058.44 --> 3062.119
like if this gets worse it's like it it

3060.52 --> 3065.48
will get

3062.119 --> 3067.96
creepy I don't have that at all from

3065.48 --> 3072.0
this even though when I wasn't eating

3067.96 --> 3074.16
this stuff I would have like an expected

3072.0 --> 3077.119
episode that usually associated with

3074.16 --> 3081.799
demoralization when I was like feeling

3077.119 --> 3083.799
bad like sickish and not like I didn't

3081.799 --> 3085.119
like myself too much or I felt ashamed

3083.799 --> 3087.64
about something and when you combine

3085.119 --> 3090.0
that sickish and feeling that issues

3087.64 --> 3093.2
start to happen typically

3090.0 --> 3095.839
anywhere but my kidneys would be a very

3093.2 --> 3099.799
typical one of those and it just doesn't

3095.839 --> 3103.16
happen now so is it because I'm all much

3099.799 --> 3105.839
better moral morally because I do the

3103.16 --> 3107.839
technique now right to put myself back

3105.839 --> 3110.92
in my body and it like sounds weird

3107.839 --> 3113.44
maybe but it's it's deadly serious to me

3110.92 --> 3117.16
it is deadly serious and this difference

3113.44 --> 3120.28
is literally day and night

3117.16 --> 3122.92
like now that I'm strict about it

3120.28 --> 3125.96
there's no more sliding into depression

3122.92 --> 3129.319
guys like not at

3125.96 --> 3131.7200000000003
all but I got to keep doing

3129.319 --> 3135.04
it but I mean I don't even have the

3131.72 --> 3138.0
slide anymore and I can like even be

3135.04 --> 3140.16
like I'm not entirely satisfied from a

3138.0 --> 3142.92
certain perspective about my life and

3140.16 --> 3147.2
that I'm like living in this little box

3142.92 --> 3150.4
almost and I'm single and I don't really

3147.2 --> 3155.48
feel I can get a future with a woman and

3150.4 --> 3155.48
her family and I can still like not get

3157.119 --> 3160.96
depressed I think that's pretty

3169.88 --> 3176.44
impressive isn't the Dead Sea said to be

3173.119 --> 3180.0
good for the body and it salt

3176.44 --> 3183.559
yeah so are plenty of other

3180.0 --> 3186.079
things dupons you'd be

3183.559 --> 3189.3590000000004
surprised but I'm not really interested

3186.079 --> 3189.3590000000004
in Dead Sea

3192.28 --> 3196.6800000000003
minerals I'm sure it's great for

3201.09 --> 3207.1600000000003
[Music]

3204.16 --> 3207.16
them

3207.76 --> 3214.2400000000002
I use the rest of the turkey for turkey

3210.559 --> 3217.52
and chips with pickles and onions huh

3214.24 --> 3217.52
that does sound kind of nice

3234.16 --> 3237.52
Tommy

3236.2 --> 3240.7599999999998
hey hello

3237.52 --> 3244.88
jedo good to see

3240.76 --> 3244.88
you oh look at how beautiful it

3251.16 --> 3255.5989999999997
is I mean that's just amazing

3256.64 --> 3261.27
looking isn't

3258.12 --> 3261.27
[Music]

3264.079 --> 3267.079
it

3272.599 --> 3279.1600000000003
constant specular shift of the camera to

3277.16 --> 3281.48
adapt to the

3279.16 --> 3283.72
brightness it's kind of weird but it is

3281.48 --> 3286.64
interesting like how that

3283.72 --> 3289.4399999999996
happens I like it when it like really

3286.64 --> 3289.44
turns

3293.48 --> 3299.0
deep but yeah it's

3295.599 --> 3301.6800000000003
like this boom you see it's like this

3299.0 --> 3303.559
and then it brightens up a bit and then

3301.68 --> 3307.44
poof

3303.559 --> 3307.44
contrast it's funny how that

3308.24 --> 3316.839
happens but I mean this is just super

3313.28 --> 3316.8390000000004
beautiful isn't it

3324.0 --> 3327.0
guys

3330.599 --> 3335.799
right and that piece of blue sky above

3332.76 --> 3338.1600000000003
there too yeah

3335.799 --> 3340.839
magical Dutch

3338.16 --> 3343.96
Skies can't compete with

3340.839 --> 3347.2
that well you can but I mean we have

3343.96 --> 3347.2
that like every day

3347.359 --> 3353.2799999999997
almost beautiful Skies really almost all

3351.039 --> 3353.28
year

3354.0 --> 3360.559
long unless they start spraying again

3356.68 --> 3360.5589999999997
which luckily is not

3365.599 --> 3373.2000000000003
today oh hey hello steamy traveler did I

3369.48 --> 3373.2
miss you there good to see

3375.28 --> 3382.44
you what is my opinion on cigarettes

3379.24 --> 3382.4399999999996
should they be banned

3383.24 --> 3392.359
no absolutely no

3386.799 --> 3394.4
not but I mean they instead of just like

3392.359 --> 3397.2799999999997
indoctrinating everybody with how

3394.4 --> 3400.48
terrible it is you could also just do

3397.28 --> 3403.7200000000003
some things to attempt to improve the

3400.48 --> 3403.72
quality of

3403.88 --> 3406.88
it

3407.319 --> 3411.599
right and

3413.24 --> 3418.1189999999997
maybe maybe takes some measures like

3415.799 --> 3423.96
with the big

3418.119 --> 3427.599
tobacco in ways like hey could you guys

3423.96 --> 3431.48
perhaps get your tobacco as raw as

3427.599 --> 3434.44
possible right and not add

3431.48 --> 3438.839
anything to have an effect maybe you can

3434.44 --> 3441.359
achieve what you wanted effect wise in

3438.839 --> 3441.359
another

3441.4 --> 3445.76
way ways that you haven't thought of

3443.64 --> 3449.0
before instead of adding

3445.76 --> 3452.039
chemicals right that would severely

3449.0 --> 3454.92
decrease the amount of damage that

3452.039 --> 3457.7200000000003
smoking cigarettes regular factory made

3454.92 --> 3460.559
cigarettes actually do because I don't

3457.72 --> 3461.64
smoke cigarettes oh no I think those

3460.559 --> 3464.92
things are

3461.64 --> 3467.0389999999998
disgusting they they are not nice and

3464.92 --> 3469.76
there's [ __ ] in there that's just really

3467.039 --> 3473.7990000000004
unhealthy and even regular cigarette

3469.76 --> 3476.7990000000004
filters are actually not

3473.799 --> 3476.799
healthy

3483.039 --> 3489.599
so but I mean raw tobacco like the

3486.319 --> 3493.599
leaves you can actually order that even

3489.599 --> 3497.2000000000003
organic is very different from when you

3493.599 --> 3501.7200000000003
buy a packet of cigarettes or even buy a

3497.2 --> 3504.0789999999997
pack packet of she of like loose

3501.72 --> 3506.72
tobacco because that's also still

3504.079 --> 3506.7200000000003
processed

3507.359 --> 3512.119
so I like the the raw Leaf system and

3510.799 --> 3516.119
you can even

3512.119 --> 3518.76
like Escape some taxation with

3516.119 --> 3522.599
that if you just get it

3518.76 --> 3525.7990000000004
raw like if I buy a packet of factory

3522.599 --> 3527.44
made cigarettes like yeah taxes all that

3525.799 --> 3530.52
well if you just buy the raw leafes you

3527.44 --> 3531.799
don't have that issue so I would like to

3530.52 --> 3536.72
see

3531.799 --> 3536.72
tobacco industry I guess just

3538.839 --> 3542.599
like become a little bit

3543.2 --> 3547.68
more aware about

3545.839 --> 3549.52
health

3547.68 --> 3554.44
developments

3549.52 --> 3557.319
and yeah and get

3554.44 --> 3560.119
destigmatized right because I don't want

3557.319 --> 3562.2
smoking to be like this oh this modern

3560.119 --> 3565.76
idea of like oh just easy quick

3562.2 --> 3570.5989999999997
enjoyment uh and just a lot of Toco buds

3565.76 --> 3573.3590000000004
everywhere disgusting right junk I try

3570.599 --> 3577.28
to avoid that and figure out how can we

3573.359 --> 3581.2
just make a similar experience that's

3577.28 --> 3581.2000000000003
not burdensome on

3585.68 --> 3592.2
everything so yeah it's even this is the

3588.839 --> 3594.319
weird thing the whole transition of like

3592.2 --> 3597.96
oh everybody's smoking everywhere like

3594.319 --> 3601.319
in 80s still like in cafes you smoke

3597.96 --> 3603.44
even in school cafeterias or

3601.319 --> 3604.839
whatever like everywhere it's like

3603.44 --> 3609.48
smoking smoking

3604.839 --> 3614.16
smoking and you had nonsmoking tables in

3609.48 --> 3617.48
restaurants remember that the nonsmoking

3614.16 --> 3619.52
tables yeah well I'm not like oh we got

3617.48 --> 3622.079
to go back to that like oh we got to

3619.52 --> 3625.839
smoke everywhere no no no because I'm

3622.079 --> 3628.2000000000003
not that big a fan of it really

3625.839 --> 3632.599
I don't even smoke like cigarettes or

3628.2 --> 3635.799
even that I roll I smoke joints I smoke

3632.599 --> 3638.1600000000003
cannabis with tobacco that's how I

3635.799 --> 3641.2
that's what I like you don't just do

3638.16 --> 3643.359
that everywhere that's you do that in a

3641.2 --> 3646.319
special occasion you do

3643.359 --> 3651.16
that at

3646.319 --> 3653.68
ease right but I'm just I don't want

3651.16 --> 3655.8799999999997
people that are into smoking to have to

3653.68 --> 3657.0789999999997
be traumatized all the time just leave

3655.88 --> 3659.92
them the [ __ ]

3657.079 --> 3663.079
alone like there's much more to smoking

3659.92 --> 3667.799
than just like oh I got to ingest a drug

3663.079 --> 3670.559
it's also a real unique social

3667.799 --> 3674.16
communication opportunity which it just

3670.559 --> 3674.1600000000003
is it just is

3676.0 --> 3682.48
that I've had most conversations like

3680.039 --> 3686.44
before I got on the internet with this

3682.48 --> 3686.44
and all that most of my conversations

3687.24 --> 3691.8799999999997
I've had intellectual

3689.64 --> 3694.1189999999997
conversations with new people that I

3691.88 --> 3698.96
didn't really know was

3694.119 --> 3698.96
smoking cuz it just it just

3699.48 --> 3704.44
works need to stop okay well don't go

3702.64 --> 3706.5589999999997
smoking again I mean if you're quitting

3704.44 --> 3709.44
you're quitting I'm just saying there is

3706.559 --> 3713.44
more to it than just o dirty big tobacco

3709.44 --> 3716.44
wants to get you it's

3713.44 --> 3716.44
horeshit

3723.16 --> 3730.72
and yeah there are actual health

3727.0 --> 3733.72
benefits even from tobacco if it's not

3730.72 --> 3733.72
typically

3733.88 --> 3737.6400000000003
processed it's just that yeah if you get

3736.079 --> 3740.48
addicted to it you like want to smoke

3737.64 --> 3742.0789999999997
all the time yeah then you have an

3740.48 --> 3746.319
addiction

3742.079 --> 3751.92
issue if you don't have the that then

3746.319 --> 3755.52
like smoking like a time every now and

3751.92 --> 3758.48
then can be have an interesting

3755.52 --> 3761.48
influence definitely not just

3758.48 --> 3761.48
negative

3762.319 --> 3767.599
so yeah pretty much Expedition truth

3765.559 --> 3770.96
yeah you need to have discipline and

3767.599 --> 3773.44
control in order to utilize the effects

3770.96 --> 3776.359
of anything it this counts for

3773.44 --> 3776.359
everything yeah

3776.799 --> 3781.2
ritual peace pipe was a powerful thing

3778.799 --> 3784.52
yeah because but it's because of that

3781.2 --> 3787.48
socialite effect though there is a

3784.52 --> 3789.92
unique and it is actually

3787.48 --> 3791.64
unique mostly maybe there's other types

3789.92 --> 3794.319
of things you can smoke or take that

3791.64 --> 3799.0789999999997
have the same influence but I've noticed

3794.319 --> 3801.7599999999998
that if tobacco you get a communicative

3799.079 --> 3803.8390000000004
connection you just do it's like it's

3801.76 --> 3805.4
much easier to just start a a

3803.839 --> 3806.96
conversation

3805.4 --> 3809.76
with somebody that's

3806.96 --> 3812.2400000000002
smoking with you like you're standing

3809.76 --> 3814.92
outside or in a smoking

3812.24 --> 3817.24
room I've always had that it's like oh

3814.92 --> 3819.039
somebody's smoking I just have it's

3817.24 --> 3821.5589999999997
easier for me to walk up to them and

3819.039 --> 3824.0
just like have a conversation or

3821.559 --> 3826.2000000000003
something

3824.0 --> 3829.079
then if nobody's

3826.2 --> 3832.0389999999998
smoking then I really don't know how to

3829.079 --> 3835.44
do that or sometimes I do but it's still

3832.039 --> 3837.44
much more clunky I just I don't know man

3835.44 --> 3839.359
smoking a cigarette makes me stop

3837.44 --> 3842.52
feeling like a

3839.359 --> 3844.56
nerd and it sounds so corny but it's

3842.52 --> 3845.88
literally

3844.56 --> 3850.72
[Music]

3845.88 --> 3850.7200000000003
true H there used to

3855.96 --> 3862.839
be not anymore though I

3860.039 --> 3864.8390000000004
mean world's just changed man it doesn't

3862.839 --> 3867.44
work like that anymore

3864.839 --> 3870.279
you can't even freaking smoke in a

3867.44 --> 3872.44
coffee shop now yeah you can't even

3870.279 --> 3874.319
smoke tobacco in a coffee shop that's

3872.44 --> 3875.799
how [ __ ] [ __ ] things have gotten

3874.319 --> 3878.96
here

3875.799 --> 3880.65
okay can smoke cannabis but you can't

3878.96 --> 3881.839
smoke it with

3880.65 --> 3885.2400000000002
[Music]

3881.839 --> 3885.24
tobacco so

3885.99 --> 3889.0699999999997
[Music]

3889.44 --> 3895.119
logical original tobacco was a huc

3893.16 --> 3898.3999999999996
syic

3895.119 --> 3900.88
I bet it could be I mean if you like

3898.4 --> 3904.2400000000002
really concentrate

3900.88 --> 3905.4
it maybe interesting bers boy I've never

3904.24 --> 3909.8799999999997
heard of

3905.4 --> 3909.88
that maybe there is like tobacco

3912.4 --> 3918.7200000000003
adjacent and now of course like tobacco

3914.96 --> 3921.599
is a plant that's been like re grown

3918.72 --> 3924.359
over and over and over again so

3921.599 --> 3926.96
yeah it's going to go through a couple

3924.359 --> 3926.96
changes

3928.2 --> 3932.96
gradually I've noticed that there's a

3930.119 --> 3934.52
lot of films with smoking in again yes

3932.96 --> 3941.2
I've noticed that

3934.52 --> 3944.68
too and I'm like yeah smoking ooh oh

3941.2 --> 3947.7599999999998
yeah smoker SM I'm I'm dude I'm just so

3944.68 --> 3950.24
[ __ ] anti everything they've done so

3947.76 --> 3952.7990000000004
I'm like yeah we don't want smoking we

3950.24 --> 3954.839
want smoking go every I'm like yeah

3952.799 --> 3958.359
smoking I want

3954.839 --> 3960.44
like one pack of cigarettes for free

3958.359 --> 3963.44
every time you enter the building and

3960.44 --> 3966.279
you have to smoke it like mandatory

3963.44 --> 3969.48
smoking now like that's my

3966.279 --> 3974.039
response so like I love it it's like oh

3969.48 --> 3977.279
smoking in movies it's awesome and I I

3974.039 --> 3981.0
want I want an

3977.279 --> 3982.68
apology I want an apology to like the

3981.0 --> 3986.0
tobacco

3982.68 --> 3986.0
companies from

3986.119 --> 3991.76
governments for what they've done for

3988.68 --> 3995.359
how they slandered them because yeah of

3991.76 --> 3997.5200000000004
course big tobacco they knew people can

3995.359 --> 4001.52
like abuse smoking and then get sick

3997.52 --> 4005.96
yeah oh no really yeah yeah like if you

4001.52 --> 4009.359
eat freaking ice creams every day you're

4005.96 --> 4011.76
going to get sick and die too eventually

4009.359 --> 4014.359
you know the risk is pretty high I mean

4011.76 --> 4016.92
they don't get I mean oh you C eat e ice

4014.359 --> 4019.279
cream anymore no more ice cream it's

4016.92 --> 4020.2400000000002
illegal now it's a health hazard no more

4019.279 --> 4022.92
ice

4020.24 --> 4024.9199999999996
cream how dare you bring an ice cream in

4022.92 --> 4030.359
here don't you know people are allergic

4024.92 --> 4030.359
to that like they don't do that [ __ ]

4030.52 --> 4036.4
yeah but they do with smoking oh

4033.559 --> 4039.88
everybody's so scared of the smoking I

4036.4 --> 4042.2000000000003
mean don't you know the hazard of people

4039.88 --> 4044.88
that are addicted to ice cream they blow

4042.2 --> 4046.8799999999997
it up and then the more of those people

4044.88 --> 4049.799
are around the higher the risk come that

4046.88 --> 4053.7200000000003
one of them trips falls on you and then

4049.799 --> 4055.599
crushes your spine yeah so it's

4053.72 --> 4059.3999999999996
dangerous ice creams are dangerous you

4055.599 --> 4061.279
need to ban them all or you risk the

4059.4 --> 4063.2400000000002
percentage of risk that you're going to

4061.279 --> 4065.48
be surrounded by bloating people that

4063.24 --> 4069.279
will accidentally trip and break your

4065.48 --> 4072.68
back is going to be substantial we have

4069.279 --> 4074.92
to ban all ice cream

4072.68 --> 4078.64
now okay

4074.92 --> 4083.359
okay right yeah that's how I feel about

4078.64 --> 4083.359
what they've done with tobacco it's

4089.319 --> 4095.72
ridiculous the ice cream

4092.72 --> 4095.72
Wars

4099.159 --> 4105.96
right can you imagine it like everybody

4103.04 --> 4107.839
just ding out ice creams everywhere

4105.96 --> 4110.799
every every time you enter a restaurant

4107.839 --> 4112.159
you get a free ice cream you get a free

4110.799 --> 4113.96
ice cream with everything I'm going to

4112.159 --> 4116.5599999999995
get a cup of coffee you get a free ice

4113.96 --> 4118.4800000000005
cream eventually everybody will start to

4116.56 --> 4122.96
blow it up right it will start to look

4118.48 --> 4126.639999999999
like uh what was that movie

4122.96 --> 4130.199
again Wall-E start to look like that and

4126.64 --> 4134.759
then yeah literally the risk of one of

4130.199 --> 4138.599999999999
them like tripping heightens and that

4134.759 --> 4141.56
then will typically multiply the typical

4138.6 --> 4144.400000000001
risk of well somebody not being that

4141.56 --> 4146.679
bloated being Fallen upon by bloated

4144.4 --> 4149.08
people and then breaking something and

4146.679 --> 4152.64
even their

4149.08 --> 4152.64
backs so

4154.239 --> 4159.919999999999
yeah secondhand bloating it can break

4157.239 --> 4159.919999999999
your back

4160.44 --> 4166.839
man ice creams are a danger they can

4163.12 --> 4169.4
cause bloating and SE even secondhand

4166.839 --> 4172.359
bloating can break your back yeah that

4169.4 --> 4172.3589999999995
that's how I would say

4181.4 --> 4184.4
it

4185.159 --> 4194.239
right and to those that really like ice

4189.759 --> 4197.0
cream just don't eat it all the time

4194.239 --> 4200.759999999999
and hey there's actually types of ice

4197.0 --> 4205.12
cream that are not super

4200.76 --> 4208.320000000001
unhealthy you should look into that even

4205.12 --> 4210.0
better make your own make it good qu

4208.32 --> 4212.4
like take it real take if you really

4210.0 --> 4216.28
love your ice cream so much then take it

4212.4 --> 4218.839999999999
really serious and go like super quality

4216.28 --> 4221.84
and be very careful and like try to

4218.84 --> 4224.2390000000005
figure out how to make it as low sugar

4221.84 --> 4226.1990000000005
as possible and still awesome

4224.239 --> 4229.5199999999995
right that way you can love your ice

4226.199 --> 4232.159
cream and not die from

4229.52 --> 4234.4800000000005
it my mother actually loved ice cream

4232.159 --> 4237.879999999999
too and she did that she made her own

4234.48 --> 4240.4
ice cream with fruit from our garden it

4237.88 --> 4242.4800000000005
was amazing I mean I've never had ice

4240.4 --> 4244.799999999999
cream ever since that could compare to

4242.48 --> 4244.799999999999
that

4245.28 --> 4251.599999999999
never if I bump into strawberry cream

4248.84 --> 4254.76
ice cream that's going to be that good I

4251.6 --> 4256.96
will literally cry I've never had

4254.76 --> 4257.84
anything that was even close to what my

4256.96 --> 4261.44
mom

4257.84 --> 4268.159000000001
made straberries from our garden too by

4261.44 --> 4271.44
the way so but yeah ice cream cool but

4268.159 --> 4275.32
like preag packaged ice creams the

4271.44 --> 4277.44
typical brand that [ __ ] is toxic man

4275.32 --> 4278.96
those fats are the

4277.44 --> 4281.678999999999
worst

4278.96 --> 4284.4
processed terrible processed sugar

4281.679 --> 4286.159
terrible processed fats

4284.4 --> 4288.799999999999
and you don't even know like how long

4286.159 --> 4291.799999999999
that's just sitting there in

4288.8 --> 4291.8
storage

4291.92 --> 4296.4
G fed live today

4297.28 --> 4304.32
yeah in like 45

4300.8 --> 4306.04
minutes right so I'll stop talking about

4304.32 --> 4309.08
ice cream

4306.04 --> 4311.88
Wars my original point is is like I

4309.08 --> 4316.88
think that just tobacco has

4311.88 --> 4316.88
been like demonized way too

4318.639 --> 4324.96
much and there should

4322.36 --> 4327.0
be like it should be approached

4324.96 --> 4330.44
differently I mean if if there's really

4327.0 --> 4332.679
such a massive health risk about it then

4330.44 --> 4335.28
figure out how to make it healthier

4332.679 --> 4338.2390000000005
right and you could say like vaping is

4335.28 --> 4344.04
already at least an attempt it's an

4338.239 --> 4345.44
attempt to make it less unhealthy right

4344.04 --> 4348.12
that's what it was there for it's like

4345.44 --> 4350.48
an attempt to make it less unhealthy so

4348.12 --> 4353.84
that's good and who knows where it could

4350.48 --> 4357.44
go further the the point is is

4353.84 --> 4362.4800000000005
like just stop stigmatizing

4357.44 --> 4366.4
it I believe tobacco actually helps

4362.48 --> 4366.4
socializing helps connecting

4367.04 --> 4370.5199999999995
better like at

4370.56 --> 4375.4400000000005
work and who knows even with family

4377.52 --> 4384.6
just be careful with it

4380.08 --> 4387.159
like don't smoke junk take your lung

4384.6 --> 4389.6
serious realize like yeah it is if you

4387.159 --> 4392.48
smoke continually it is going to be a

4389.6 --> 4395.8
burden on you so how can

4392.48 --> 4398.678999999999
you like lighten that burden as much as

4395.8 --> 4403.56
possible I lighten that burden

4398.679 --> 4407.4400000000005
by using carbon filters all the time

4403.56 --> 4409.52
never smoke without it

4407.44 --> 4413.44
carbon these things are filled with

4409.52 --> 4416.2390000000005
carbon granules they take out a lot of

4413.44 --> 4419.48
the tar that and other chemicals too

4416.239 --> 4423.718999999999
that typically do come out out of the

4419.48 --> 4426.239
ignited tobacco not all of it is good

4423.719 --> 4430.12
but these types of filters I have found

4426.239 --> 4430.12
really take out the worst

4431.96 --> 4440.0
components and ever since I started

4434.84 --> 4442.639
smoking these I don't cough anymore like

4440.0 --> 4447.48
at all like it just doesn't happen I

4442.639 --> 4450.52
don't get smoker cough like ever dude I

4447.48 --> 4453.638999999999
don't like even when I get colds and all

4450.52 --> 4456.0
that nothing happens it's so much better

4453.639 --> 4460.159000000001
it's not perfect I know there still some

4456.0 --> 4463.56
of it coming through but it's been a

4460.159 --> 4465.5599999999995
huge world of difference since I

4463.56 --> 4468.639
discover these things compared to well

4465.56 --> 4472.400000000001
the 10 years before when I

4468.639 --> 4472.400000000001
smoked the regular

4476.28 --> 4481.92
way

4479.0 --> 4483.36
what okay flat land not really talking

4481.92 --> 4487.4
about that what are you talking about

4483.36 --> 4487.4
berserk a few days ago what do you

4489.88 --> 4496.6
mean they chew it back a yuck

4493.84 --> 4497.639
hey if you like it you like it I think

4496.6 --> 4499.96
it's

4497.639 --> 4503.52
disgusting doing

4499.96 --> 4505.76
tobacco it's going to wear on your teeth

4503.52 --> 4508.96
I mean you're going to get it's going to

4505.76 --> 4512.2390000000005
start looking really [ __ ] gross like

4508.96 --> 4517.28
much more than me using carbon filters

4512.239 --> 4521.36
and smoking yeah because I smoke every

4517.28 --> 4524.679
day it's barely there 10 years ago holy

4521.36 --> 4527.5199999999995
[ __ ] you would see like these Brown

4524.679 --> 4530.4400000000005
lines on my teeth it was

4527.52 --> 4533.400000000001
terrible

4530.44 --> 4536.719
terrible since I'm using these

4533.4 --> 4539.679
things it's practically

4536.719 --> 4544.52
gone yeah it doesn't get on my teeth

4539.679 --> 4544.52
doesn't get in my lungs it's a lot

4547.8 --> 4551.639
better I got another

4619.36 --> 4623.44
by the way for anybody that's in the ice

4621.679 --> 4626.28
cream business out

4623.44 --> 4629.638999999999
there don't worry I'm not actually going

4626.28 --> 4632.28
to create an ice cream cream

4629.639 --> 4634.56
Wars I don't want to mess with

4632.28 --> 4637.92
professional ice cream makers I

4634.56 --> 4640.679
mean they have a lot of places to just

4637.92 --> 4645.0
make me disappear in freezers and all

4640.679 --> 4645.0
that so don't worry

4645.04 --> 4650.48
you can have your business I'm just all

4648.0 --> 4652.12
for the healthy stuff I'm always like oh

4650.48 --> 4654.199
get it healthier get it healthier get it

4652.12 --> 4656.639
better get it better if you can let's

4654.199 --> 4659.638999999999
figure it out maybe we can figure it

4656.639 --> 4659.639
out

4660.08 --> 4665.28
right but I want just the

4662.88 --> 4668.679
destigmatization of smoking I really do

4665.28 --> 4668.679
want that I want it to

4672.0 --> 4679.12
stop I mean don't make it cool with the

4674.8 --> 4681.96
kids or anything but I mean just just

4679.12 --> 4685.599999999999
don't be freaking mean to smokers all

4681.96 --> 4687.0
the damn time like that part I really I

4685.6 --> 4690.0
hate

4687.0 --> 4690.0
that

4693.159 --> 4701.48
yeah at the same time I really do think

4697.199 --> 4701.48
that smokers should

4701.92 --> 4705.719
absolutely

4703.44 --> 4708.199
realize that there are people out there

4705.719 --> 4712.0
that really can't stand smoking and the

4708.199 --> 4715.879999999999
smell of smoke and that you should try

4712.0 --> 4718.239
to not just be like we're smokers I'm

4715.88 --> 4720.679
just going to smoke and you're bothered

4718.239 --> 4724.879999999999
like try to

4720.679 --> 4727.36
be nice with it and if possible like hey

4724.88 --> 4731.12
if there is like separate smoking rooms

4727.36 --> 4734.92
non-smoking rooms that's actually really

4731.12 --> 4734.92
useful that's good that's

4737.12 --> 4744.08
better right guess what happens though

4741.199 --> 4746.199
in those rooms yeah yeah even nonsmokers

4744.08 --> 4749.0
typically go and hang with the smokers

4746.199 --> 4750.4
because why well where there's smoke

4749.0 --> 4753.639
there's a lot of interesting

4750.4 --> 4757.48
conversations every time I've been to so

4753.639 --> 4759.56
many parties in the day not that many

4757.48 --> 4762.32
really but plenty and there's like

4759.56 --> 4764.400000000001
smoking rooms even back then and

4762.32 --> 4765.719
nonsmoking places and it's like yeah

4764.4 --> 4767.4
everybody's always hanging around in

4765.719 --> 4769.76
smoking rooms it's blah blah blah blah

4767.4 --> 4772.0
blah talking talking talking me I'm

4769.76 --> 4774.320000000001
there

4772.0 --> 4776.88
talking and other people

4774.32 --> 4778.599999999999
too but it's always stuffed even with

4776.88 --> 4781.32
people that don't smoke because it's

4778.6 --> 4781.320000000001
like yeah they're

4785.239 --> 4790.32
talking ah damn you

4791.4 --> 4797.0
Tommy I gave you that idea though but uh

4795.0 --> 4799.88
yeah no I'm not starting any ice cream

4797.0 --> 4799.88
Wars don't

4804.28 --> 4810.36
worry I'm really against prohibition of

4807.159 --> 4813.32
most things

4810.36 --> 4816.5199999999995
but there should be like a

4813.32 --> 4819.4
more yeah like things you

4816.52 --> 4821.280000000001
can what you can advertise and what you

4819.4 --> 4823.32
can't there should be like more

4821.28 --> 4824.96
attention to that and like

4823.32 --> 4827.96
I don't think alcohol should be

4824.96 --> 4831.4800000000005
advertised at all

4827.96 --> 4833.88
really or in like very specific

4831.48 --> 4837.879999999999
circumstances it's almost

4833.88 --> 4841.0
like you go to a cafe or a bar where

4837.88 --> 4843.36
there's typically drinks well that's a

4841.0 --> 4845.44
place to see advertisement for drinks

4843.36 --> 4848.599999999999
then

4845.44 --> 4850.96
right and not on the side of the road

4848.6 --> 4854.2390000000005
while you're in stuck in

4850.96 --> 4858.12
traffic like I I don't that

4854.239 --> 4861.239
no piss off what are you doing alcohol

4858.12 --> 4864.48
commercials like in the open

4861.239 --> 4866.799999999999
no but in places where it's like yeah

4864.48 --> 4869.879999999999
you're going to be drinking there then

4866.8 --> 4871.6
yeah ads do do ads on screens in the

4869.88 --> 4873.6
toilets or whatever

4871.6 --> 4877.88
drinking whatever

4873.6 --> 4881.08
man like there's a there's a proper

4877.88 --> 4885.36
place for ads too I don't want to just

4881.08 --> 4885.36
ban all ads it's just

4885.96 --> 4892.159
that how can you make

4888.639 --> 4895.159000000001
ads actually find the right target that

4892.159 --> 4899.12
will be appreciated being targeted in

4895.159 --> 4901.199
the right moment and avoid being pushy

4899.12 --> 4904.28
on people that really don't want to have

4901.199 --> 4906.28
anything to do with it right maybe

4904.28 --> 4910.48
that's a a

4906.28 --> 4913.159
challenge to make ads more efficient in

4910.48 --> 4915.799999999999
universally but anyway

4913.159 --> 4918.199
I don't know where I'm going with this

4915.8 --> 4918.1990000000005
it's an

4918.6 --> 4922.2390000000005
idea censorship

4923.84 --> 4931.400000000001
stinks ads add

4926.4 --> 4934.48
nothing not necessarily I've had certain

4931.4 --> 4936.719
ads that would pop up that actually had

4934.48 --> 4938.759999999999
something interesting it's like hey a

4936.719 --> 4940.32
new product not that I'm going to buy

4938.76 --> 4942.04
that product but was like oh that's

4940.32 --> 4943.239
interesting to know that it actually

4942.04 --> 4947.88
exists

4943.239 --> 4950.839999999999
huh so it's like no ads can add

4947.88 --> 4954.159000000001
something unless all ads are really

4950.84 --> 4956.12
aggressive really sucky and only want to

4954.159 --> 4959.239
get you additive to some addicted to

4956.12 --> 4962.44
something that's terrible yeah if it's

4959.239 --> 4965.599999999999
just those types of ads yeah that

4962.44 --> 4969.48
sucks but I mean sometimes it's also

4965.6 --> 4969.4800000000005
just like hey did you know there is

4971.56 --> 4977.0
this

4974.04 --> 4982.28
like oh we found out a a hyper new

4977.0 --> 4984.0
modern way like a new engineered form of

4982.28 --> 4985.639
vacuum cleaner right there's been plenty

4984.0 --> 4987.32
of those but I mean like oh a

4985.639 --> 4990.639
revolutionary new form look what it

4987.32 --> 4992.639
could do like I'm not going to buy that

4990.639 --> 4996.28
I don't have the money for but I'd be

4992.639 --> 4999.400000000001
interested in knowing that existed and

4996.28 --> 5000.5599999999995
that's also something that an ad can

4999.4 --> 5003.48
actually

5000.56 --> 5007.1990000000005
add see

5003.48 --> 5007.199
ads don't have to all be

5007.92 --> 5015.8
bad right remember that ads are

5012.0 --> 5018.8
originally it's just a sales pitch are

5015.8 --> 5020.52
all sales pitch evil or do some people

5018.8 --> 5022.6
actually go out and they want to buy

5020.52 --> 5026.52
something and they are looking for a

5022.6 --> 5028.719
good sales pitch see if you just see ads

5026.52 --> 5029.96
like that then they don't have to just

5028.719 --> 5033.88
be in your

5029.96 --> 5035.8
way they could actually give you

5033.88 --> 5037.12
something something that you might be

5035.8 --> 5040.679
looking for something that you didn't

5037.12 --> 5040.679
even know you were looking for

5041.159 --> 5045.48
see I'm sorry I'm going all Edward

5043.639 --> 5049.400000000001
Bernay on you guys

5045.48 --> 5053.12
now promoting smoking and telling you

5049.4 --> 5055.96
the advantages of ads I'm really G full

5053.12 --> 5058.96
Edward ber aren't

5055.96 --> 5058.96
i

5061.36 --> 5064.36
h

5070.32 --> 5075.0
okay I'm going to have to think about a

5072.12 --> 5075.0
title to figure

5075.8 --> 5081.96
out I'm it's going to have to contain

5078.76 --> 5081.96
ice cream Wars

5091.36 --> 5094.36
though

5107.82 --> 5114.0599999999995
[Music]

5110.88 --> 5117.249
make just make it a little silly

5114.06 --> 5117.249000000001
[Music]

5121.28 --> 5124.28
here

5131.0 --> 5135.52
I just created a false dichotomy out of

5133.239 --> 5138.04
it until further

5135.52 --> 5141.84
notice it's going to be the tobacco

5138.04 --> 5141.84
versus Ice Cream ad

5142.639 --> 5146.119
Wars how about

5151.28 --> 5156.679
that

5154.119 --> 5160.5199999999995
what have I owned a car yeah I did in

5156.679 --> 5160.52
the past who are you talking

5169.6 --> 5176.04
to yeah Tommy it would be kind of funny

5172.44 --> 5178.678999999999
too like what if you're like if two

5176.04 --> 5181.44
companies of two different products like

5178.679 --> 5183.56
started a war about how the other

5181.44 --> 5184.48
product is Terri and how their product

5183.56 --> 5187.400000000001
is

5184.48 --> 5188.718999999999
good you could have like tobacco versus

5187.4 --> 5191.36
ice cream and then the ice cream is

5188.719 --> 5192.88
arguing why tobacco so terrible now you

5191.36 --> 5195.32
need get the ice cream and then the

5192.88 --> 5197.639
tobacco is going to be like no no

5195.32 --> 5199.679
tobacco actually has medicinal benefits

5197.639 --> 5202.4800000000005
and ice cream is actually really bad

5199.679 --> 5206.4400000000005
look at this and they could they could

5202.48 --> 5206.44
blow up and fall on you you break your

5206.48 --> 5210.879999999999
back like I mean

5210.92 --> 5216.4800000000005
yeah I wonder what that would do would

5214.84 --> 5220.0
people get caught up in a false

5216.48 --> 5223.159
dichotomy and actually be tricked to be

5220.0 --> 5226.0
like tobacco versus ice

5223.159 --> 5228.5599999999995
cream I guess probably in these in this

5226.0 --> 5228.56
age they

5229.04 --> 5234.239
would people get carried away in this

5231.36 --> 5234.239
nonsense very

5240.44 --> 5247.879999999999
quickly shroy 's car what the [ __ ] this

5245.36 --> 5247.88
sounds

5252.76 --> 5260.2390000000005
dark is that like a car with blackened

5257.76 --> 5264.8
windows

5260.239 --> 5267.28
that has a like what is it a an

5264.8 --> 5269.96
airbag that you don't know whether it

5267.28 --> 5269.96
will work or

5271.119 --> 5276.159
not

5273.239 --> 5279.0
so there's a car it's going to drive

5276.159 --> 5281.36
into like a a wall or

5279.0 --> 5283.719
something and then you don't know

5281.36 --> 5286.92
whether the guy that's driving in there

5283.719 --> 5291.4
whether he even is in there and what his

5286.92 --> 5291.4
condition is until you open that

5292.679 --> 5296.76
door is that sher's

5298.56 --> 5307.119000000001
car what do I think of electric cars

5303.199 --> 5307.119
cute but

5309.48 --> 5314.799999999999
ridiculous and definitely not something

5312.239 --> 5317.4
that should be

5314.8 --> 5319.28
mass-produced like

5317.4 --> 5322.879999999999
that I

5319.28 --> 5325.599999999999
mean there is like a benefit in a way to

5322.88 --> 5328.2390000000005
electric cars it is kind of nice that

5325.6 --> 5332.8
they don't have any exhaust you know it

5328.239 --> 5334.879999999999
is kind of nice but then you you have

5332.8 --> 5338.4800000000005
the well

5334.88 --> 5340.8
overwhelming energy deficiency problem

5338.48 --> 5342.919999999999
like how much freaking electricity do

5340.8 --> 5347.04
those things actually

5342.92 --> 5349.719
cost and comparatively yeah how how much

5347.04 --> 5352.239
gasoline does that actually translate

5349.719 --> 5355.04
into and then you find out like yeah

5352.239 --> 5357.678999999999
they're actually not efficient at

5355.04 --> 5358.88
all they're kind of like gross energy

5357.679 --> 5362.679
wasters

5358.88 --> 5365.159000000001
really yeah and the batteries

5362.679 --> 5367.96
that they will have to have they're

5365.159 --> 5371.759999999999
always big they have a lot of stuff in

5367.96 --> 5371.76
there that's really

5372.4 --> 5378.32
polluting and it's

5375.08 --> 5381.239
like a terrible mining process to get

5378.32 --> 5384.239
that stuff right and it doesn't last

5381.239 --> 5385.199
forever so it's actually very wasteful

5384.239 --> 5387.239
on the

5385.199 --> 5389.5599999999995
environment because of the batteries

5387.239 --> 5392.799999999999
that they require that don't last

5389.56 --> 5395.119000000001
forever and then there's this horrendous

5392.8 --> 5397.360000000001
Hazard that if you crash with a car like

5395.119 --> 5399.679
that really hard and the battery gets

5397.36 --> 5401.96
hit there's a big chance it will

5399.679 --> 5404.84
literally burst out in a giant ball of

5401.96 --> 5407.52
flames which will incinerate you and

5404.84 --> 5411.6
it's not it happened multiple times has

5407.52 --> 5413.92
another nice little side option from

5411.6 --> 5416.679
electric cars yeah that's probably not

5413.92 --> 5419.32
going to be completely avoidable even in

5416.679 --> 5422.28
the near future

5419.32 --> 5425.199
so no I'm not a super big fan of

5422.28 --> 5429.28
electric cars they're kind of cute in a

5425.199 --> 5433.0
way there might be a place for them it's

5429.28 --> 5437.119
like maybe like

5433.0 --> 5438.88
buses like passenger buses maybe if they

5437.119 --> 5441.199
would be electric that would kind of

5438.88 --> 5444.52
work out it might be more efficient that

5441.199 --> 5447.759999999999
way and hey no polluting gases buses

5444.52 --> 5449.4400000000005
really stink typically if they were

5447.76 --> 5451.96
electric then yeah that would be pretty

5449.44 --> 5455.32
cool but for the regular passenger car

5451.96 --> 5459.08
like regular private cars and all that

5455.32 --> 5459.08
no no it's not

5459.239 --> 5464.638999999999
efficient it cost more

5462.0 --> 5466.88
energy and there's going to be giant

5464.639 --> 5467.8
material shortage that you're not going

5466.88 --> 5470.36
to

5467.8 --> 5471.88
get like you you won't be able to get

5470.36 --> 5475.119
that

5471.88 --> 5478.0
right unless you're like make deals with

5475.119 --> 5480.119
the Beast system it's and then even then

5478.0 --> 5482.28
it's not going to last forever

5480.119 --> 5486.679
well that resour

5482.28 --> 5490.4
shortage problem you will never

5486.679 --> 5493.76
have ever with a gasoline car or a

5490.4 --> 5496.879999999999
diesel car or a gas car even and which

5493.76 --> 5500.52
could be hydrogen gas if you insist on

5496.88 --> 5502.92
not using fossil fuels which is just

5500.52 --> 5506.080000000001
like abiotic oil that replenishes

5502.92 --> 5508.719
forever it literally does they it never

5506.08 --> 5510.719
runs out oil wells refill themselves

5508.719 --> 5513.0
because it's abiotic it's a bacteria

5510.719 --> 5516.2390000000005
that actually under high pressure eats

5513.0 --> 5518.88
away at Rock and Minerals and creates

5516.239 --> 5520.08
the the goo the black goo that we know

5518.88 --> 5523.28
as

5520.08 --> 5526.92
oil and they replenish and there's like

5523.28 --> 5531.88
more oil that we could ever use

5526.92 --> 5534.28
forever infinite oil yeah but

5531.88 --> 5537.119
transforming that in gasoline does well

5534.28 --> 5539.199
give a lot of like wasteful side

5537.119 --> 5542.719
products so it's

5539.199 --> 5544.638999999999
not 100% option but

5542.719 --> 5546.639
it's being developed further and further

5544.639 --> 5549.32
and further and further and it's so much

5546.639 --> 5550.4400000000005
more efficient now than it was like a

5549.32 --> 5556.239
100 years

5550.44 --> 5560.159
ago like unbelievably more efficient

5556.239 --> 5563.4
and what you only need steel for the

5560.159 --> 5566.799999999999
cars right you don't need

5563.4 --> 5568.638999999999
psychotic large amount of materials for

5566.8 --> 5570.84
batteries and all that [ __ ] you know

5568.639 --> 5574.32
just a regular car battery that's all

5570.84 --> 5578.08
you need doesn't even take that special

5574.32 --> 5583.08
material it's just it's feasible it's

5578.08 --> 5587.119
durable gasoline gas and diesel cars are

5583.08 --> 5591.44
feasible for private ownership and all

5587.119 --> 5594.199
that battery cars not feasible not

5591.44 --> 5596.4
durable will run out it's like oh you

5594.199 --> 5599.0
could be really special with it and then

5596.4 --> 5603.119
after like a few decades it's

5599.0 --> 5607.8
gone so what is the point when you can

5603.119 --> 5611.04
have regular engine cars running on

5607.8 --> 5614.4400000000005
gasoline gas and

5611.04 --> 5618.159
Diesel until the end of humanity pretty

5614.44 --> 5619.638999999999
much forever it's never going to run out

5618.159 --> 5622.119
and there's always going to be enough

5619.639 --> 5624.400000000001
material to have that available because

5622.119 --> 5626.88
you really only need the oil wells and

5624.4 --> 5629.599999999999
the steel and the refineries and there's

5626.88 --> 5632.32
plenty of materials of that

5629.6 --> 5635.08
everywhere always

5632.32 --> 5636.759999999999
much more durable that's what I think

5635.08 --> 5640.159
about

5636.76 --> 5643.8
that hope that answers your question

5640.159 --> 5646.28
Tommy was that Tommy who

5643.8 --> 5648.4400000000005
asked good idea about the buses yeah I

5646.28 --> 5651.84
know I have good

5648.44 --> 5654.638999999999
ideas cuz there is an actual

5651.84 --> 5657.28
environmental Advantage about electric

5654.639 --> 5658.92
vehicles and that is they have no

5657.28 --> 5661.92
exhaust

5658.92 --> 5663.92
so you can make that matter where it

5661.92 --> 5666.92
matters but if you're like oh no all of

5663.92 --> 5669.96
it then it's not going to work but if

5666.92 --> 5671.76
you have like dedicated

5669.96 --> 5674.44
Vehicles like

5671.76 --> 5677.2390000000005
buses then it could

5674.44 --> 5680.199
matter and the bigger it is the more

5677.239 --> 5680.199
efficient it could

5681.32 --> 5686.799999999999
be right well private Vehicles well

5684.4 --> 5689.199
you're driving around with one person

5686.8 --> 5692.52
taking up all that battery and you still

5689.199 --> 5696.44
have to recharge it right so bigger

5692.52 --> 5698.0
vehicles would technically benefit more

5696.44 --> 5701.799999999999
from being

5698.0 --> 5704.36
electric than smaller vehicles for

5701.8 --> 5704.360000000001
private

5709.639 --> 5716.08
use right so yeah electric school buses

5713.159 --> 5718.719
or electric city

5716.08 --> 5720.4
buses right it's it's basically one step

5718.719 --> 5723.4
away from a

5720.4 --> 5723.4
trm

5725.04 --> 5728.6
like a little electric train that goes

5726.92 --> 5730.36
on a rail in the middle of the city on

5728.6 --> 5733.119000000001
the

5730.36 --> 5735.799999999999
road well if you have an electric bus

5733.119 --> 5738.36
it's like a tram but on Wheels and it

5735.8 --> 5738.360000000001
works it's

5740.0 --> 5743.0
clean

5748.199 --> 5753.0
great right but you could also instead

5750.76 --> 5754.92
of by the way for buses and this has

5753.0 --> 5758.04
been done in the Netherlands you don't

5754.92 --> 5761.04
hear about it anymore you can also say

5758.04 --> 5762.36
oh no gasoline or diesel we're going to

5761.04 --> 5764.96
go with

5762.36 --> 5766.679
hydrogen because hydrogen doesn't smell

5764.96 --> 5770.84
it just creates

5766.679 --> 5772.679
water yes exhaust that's it so you could

5770.84 --> 5776.639
if you want it just for the cleanness

5772.679 --> 5779.4400000000005
you could also just screw electric cars

5776.639 --> 5782.84
go for still a typical old-fashioned

5779.44 --> 5786.08
engine and just use hydrogen instead of

5782.84 --> 5788.04
gasoline or diesel but I mean you don't

5786.08 --> 5790.639
even even have to do that anymore these

5788.04 --> 5793.719
days because there's diesel engines that

5790.639 --> 5797.159000000001
are so clean

5793.719 --> 5800.84
burning it's it's

5797.159 --> 5803.48
surreal like diesel engines used to be

5800.84 --> 5806.679
like you could smell that right at a

5803.48 --> 5809.32
distance now there's diesel engines that

5806.679 --> 5811.32
are so clean you like have to like

5809.32 --> 5815.48
really get up and close to the exhaust

5811.32 --> 5817.599999999999
cost to even smell it these things are

5815.48 --> 5820.959999999999
getting

5817.6 --> 5820.96
clean really

5829.44 --> 5837.159
clean so yeah I think that environmental

5834.28 --> 5840.199
wise the future is very bright really no

5837.159 --> 5842.0
matter what the technology has all been

5840.199 --> 5844.5199999999995
adapting

5842.0 --> 5847.32
to that to things getting cleaner it's

5844.52 --> 5848.76
like it's going to be cleaner it's like

5847.32 --> 5851.04
the worst that can happen is that the

5848.76 --> 5853.76
freaking Elite with their stupidity and

5851.04 --> 5856.48
their arrogance is going to ruin it the

5853.76 --> 5858.4400000000005
actual the actual clean Revolution this

5856.48 --> 5860.638999999999
is already under way but that they're

5858.44 --> 5863.04
going to ruin it because they just they

5860.639 --> 5864.76
don't care anymore they just want Power

5863.04 --> 5867.48
they just want everybody to do what they

5864.76 --> 5869.599
want right they they don't care anymore

5867.48 --> 5872.959999999999
they just want the power so they could

5869.599 --> 5875.360000000001
ruin it still they just messing

5872.96 --> 5875.36
everything

5877.199 --> 5882.44
up yeah modern engines are very

5879.639 --> 5882.4400000000005
efficient indeed

5887.159 --> 5894.119
clutch right I mean the governments or

5891.159 --> 5897.5199999999995
these politician [ __ ] they're much

5894.119 --> 5901.239
more concerned about their stupid CO2

5897.52 --> 5903.159000000001
pyramid scheme money [ __ ] then

5901.239 --> 5905.119
actually whether the place is clean or

5903.159 --> 5908.96
not unless it's like their backyard of

5905.119 --> 5912.44
course or their front door right but

5908.96 --> 5916.28
they don't care if things are

5912.44 --> 5918.119
clean they want their place clean and

5916.28 --> 5919.88
they want to make as much money as they

5918.119 --> 5922.28
can and they want to have virtue

5919.88 --> 5925.0
signaling respect from the

5922.28 --> 5926.759999999999
world and that's it they don't give a

5925.0 --> 5930.239
[ __ ] if it's actually going to be

5926.76 --> 5934.52
cleaner they just want the power and

5930.239 --> 5934.5199999999995
they own place

5943.639 --> 5949.0
clean every Everything government does

5946.679 --> 5951.719
seem to have an opposite effect

5949.0 --> 5953.679
yeah it's because it's become weaponized

5951.719 --> 5955.84
against the people it's starting to

5953.679 --> 5957.119
besiege the people instead of service

5955.84 --> 5960.84
the

5957.119 --> 5962.199
people so with the help of big Tech by

5960.84 --> 5965.4800000000005
the way

5962.199 --> 5967.719
way so there's actually a new fascist

5965.48 --> 5971.28
system growing that's what it is right

5967.719 --> 5974.599
Corporation of or the cooperation

5971.28 --> 5977.719
between corporations and

5974.599 --> 5979.08
industries corpor yeah with government

5977.719 --> 5982.2390000000005
against the people that's what's

5979.08 --> 5984.0
happening it's a FAS it's fascist it's

5982.239 --> 5985.678999999999
been growing

5984.0 --> 5988.199
gradually

5985.679 --> 5992.04
and the more it becomes like that the

5988.199 --> 5994.239
more they will besiege Humanity start to

5992.04 --> 5998.36
use peer pressure try

5994.239 --> 6000.839999999999
to determine how we should think and how

5998.36 --> 6000.839999999999
we should

6001.52 --> 6005.8
act right they're more concerned with

6009.119 --> 6013.239
that combustion engines aren't that yeah

6012.159 --> 6017.32
they

6013.239 --> 6019.959999999999
are they damn well are these days akumu

6017.32 --> 6022.96
virus they're

6019.96 --> 6022.96
great

6028.119 --> 6033.159
like even in the '90s combustion engines

6031.0 --> 6035.56
were already pretty damn impressive

6033.159 --> 6037.5599999999995
really they were already really better

6035.56 --> 6039.320000000001
like compared to engines from like the

6037.56 --> 6042.639
70s and all

6039.32 --> 6044.84
that don't even bring up engines like

6042.639 --> 6048.96
before the

6044.84 --> 6051.92
30s seriously that was just like thick

6048.96 --> 6055.08
black smoke [ __ ] before that right

6051.92 --> 6058.36
but dude it was already so efficient in

6055.08 --> 6060.719
the '90s and I'm glad that there's still

6058.36 --> 6063.08
combustion engine developers that are

6060.719 --> 6065.56
just like yeah whatever electric we're

6063.08 --> 6069.04
going to keep developing because like

6065.56 --> 6069.04
it's not reached its peak

6069.36 --> 6077.799999999999
yet amazingly combustion engines can get

6073.0 --> 6077.8
even more efficient still still

6078.239 --> 6082.759999999999
now yeah they didn't tell you that at

6080.56 --> 6086.080000000001
the climate change convention now did

6082.76 --> 6089.599
they huh oh they oh they didn't tell you

6086.08 --> 6089.599
that yeah why would that

6089.92 --> 6095.4800000000005
be maybe because you wouldn't then in

6092.639 --> 6099.599
start investing in their pyramid schemes

6095.48 --> 6099.598999999999
as much they told you that

6109.84 --> 6112.84
right

6117.0 --> 6122.199
yeah so all the climate change concerns

6119.8 --> 6123.719
everything about oil is all been

6122.199 --> 6126.5199999999995
nonsense

6123.719 --> 6129.199
yeah it's not really a fossil fuel it's

6126.52 --> 6129.1990000000005
not going to run

6129.4 --> 6137.0
out it's not going to change the climate

6132.76 --> 6139.4400000000005
with the gases blah blah blah pollution

6137.0 --> 6141.52
nonsense it's getting more clean and all

6139.44 --> 6146.719
that's going to eventually be left is

6141.52 --> 6150.159000000001
mostly water vapor and CO2 oh CO2 yeah

6146.719 --> 6152.719
yeah yeah CO2 the most beneficial

6150.159 --> 6156.5599999999995
gas you can that that comes out of

6152.719 --> 6157.76
Industry that that greatly benefits all

6156.56 --> 6162.2390000000005
plant

6157.76 --> 6165.400000000001
life greatly benefits all plant life and

6162.239 --> 6168.04
thereby well all nature because like

6165.4 --> 6170.598999999999
yeah all the insects and all the animals

6168.04 --> 6171.32
well they use the plant life now don't

6170.599 --> 6175.52
they

6171.32 --> 6175.5199999999995
yeah so it's good for

6179.04 --> 6185.0
everything so this crazy scenario they

6182.119 --> 6187.88
try to pull they try to pull over your

6185.0 --> 6190.76
eyes about oh how it's going to destroy

6187.88 --> 6194.1990000000005
the world and whatever yeah now that's

6190.76 --> 6196.52
all nonsense distraction from the fact

6194.199 --> 6199.678999999999
that it's actually growing into one of

6196.52 --> 6202.679
the most naturally efficient

6199.679 --> 6202.679
environmentally

6204.36 --> 6209.639
systems that humanties ever had yeah

6208.04 --> 6213.239
that's what's actually happening it's

6209.639 --> 6217.599
becoming super efficient super clean

6213.239 --> 6221.159
durable never running out easy to make

6217.599 --> 6225.159000000001
easier to make producible everywhere

6221.159 --> 6228.879999999999
available everywhere like it's the best

6225.159 --> 6231.879999999999
thing ever and all these climate change

6228.88 --> 6234.8
cultists and scam artti they're all just

6231.88 --> 6238.639
trying to distract you away from that

6234.8 --> 6243.4800000000005
development because that's less power

6238.639 --> 6246.1990000000005
for them more actual practical freedom

6243.48 --> 6250.678999999999
for every human

6246.199 --> 6250.678999999999
being okay that's what that

6254.679 --> 6258.2390000000005
is right anyway I'm going to move

6256.8 --> 6262.599
towards rounding out the show it's been

6258.239 --> 6262.598999999999
great though I hope you all enjoyed it

6267.199 --> 6270.919999999999
maybe I I want to put this into the

6268.599 --> 6270.92
title

6284.91 --> 6288.01
[Music]

6289.56 --> 6302.63

[Music]

6340.65 --> 6344.04
[Music]

6342.56 --> 6347.679
yeah I guess I'll do it than this

6344.04 --> 6347.679
combustion is cleaner than

6349.48 --> 6354.959999999999
Electric because the word engines won't

6352.44 --> 6358.44
fit I have one

6354.96 --> 6360.04
character left what do you guys think is

6358.44 --> 6364.199
that

6360.04 --> 6366.5199999999995
good combustion is cleaner than

6364.199 --> 6369.5599999999995
electric oh maybe I'll turn it into the

6366.52 --> 6370.76
N sign that's better that fits in 100

6369.56 --> 6374.84
characters

[Music]

6394.48 --> 6401.919999999999
know yeah if you have it set to top chat

6398.44 --> 6404.678999999999
which is the default it sometimes leaves

6401.92 --> 6406.4400000000005
certain people out I always go to live

6404.679 --> 6409.04
chat in the

6406.44 --> 6412.4
options because that way you literally

6409.04 --> 6412.4
see everybody

6432.8 --> 6440.400000000001
oh I'm looking forward to my

6436.32 --> 6444.0
coffee but I also got to go out and like

6440.4 --> 6444.0
go to the grocery store get some

6446.36 --> 6450.5199999999995
dinner like I want to use the

6448.679 --> 6455.599
opportunity now that the weather's still

6450.52 --> 6455.599
beautiful and not rainy and cold and

6466.119 --> 6469.119
windy

6469.32 --> 6472.32
right

6499.239 --> 6502.239
for

6513.96 --> 6520.679
how do generate the electricity coal

6516.56 --> 6523.4800000000005
nuclear well clutch ironically most the

6520.679 --> 6527.88
electric vehicles are actually powered

6523.48 --> 6532.199
by engines gas turbines that are

6527.88 --> 6532.1990000000005
like engines running on

6533.28 --> 6538.44
gas although yeah these days it's less

6535.92 --> 6539.92
because the nor streen pipeline got

6538.44 --> 6542.919999999999
blown

6539.92 --> 6546.04
up but yeah that was going to be mostly

6542.92 --> 6549.96
gas doing that so it's like oh we're so

6546.04 --> 6553.239
clean I got it's electric electricity

6549.96 --> 6556.599
that's being generated with gas

6553.239 --> 6558.919999999999
turbines okay I mean I'm all for it dude

6556.599 --> 6562.119000000001
that's all great you could also just

6558.92 --> 6563.96
like have gas in in your actual car but

6562.119 --> 6566.759999999999
I mean oo you're special with your

6563.96 --> 6566.76
electric

6569.71 --> 6578.2390000000005
[Music]

6574.48 --> 6584.0
okay oh that oh right spelling error

6578.239 --> 6584.0
thanks seeking yeah yeah I'm sorry

6589.119 --> 6592.119
yep

6596.92 --> 6599.1990000000005
right

6599.4 --> 6606.04
because it's not about a uh it's not a a

6604.199 --> 6611.0
pointer at a moment in

6606.04 --> 6614.36
time it's a pointer or it's a a ratio

6611.0 --> 6618.159
connecting word so it's like

6614.36 --> 6618.159
this more than

6619.04 --> 6622.04
that

6625.96 --> 6632.76
and then is always a Moment In Time the

6627.88 --> 6632.76
e is a moment of time the a is a is a

6632.8 --> 6637.400000000001
comparison I get it mostly right though

6635.56 --> 6639.52
which is really impressive because I

6637.4 --> 6642.719
always got it wrong when I was young

6639.52 --> 6645.679
always every single time it drove me

6642.719 --> 6649.119
nuts it's the reason why I didn't have a

6645.679 --> 6651.03
a on my English probably because of that

6649.119 --> 6654.0599999999995
the freaking then

6651.03 --> 6654.0599999999995
[Music]

6658.239 --> 6664.159
anyway thanks yeah but I do appreciate

6661.719 --> 6666.079
when you pointed out when I was wrong so

6664.159 --> 6669.36
thank you for that seeking star

6666.079 --> 6672.4
water and yeah glad to hear I rarely

6669.36 --> 6676.04
make errors

6672.4 --> 6679.119
anymore but then then is always

6676.04 --> 6683.5199999999995
difficult for me always has been but I

6679.119 --> 6683.5199999999995
get it a lot better these days it's just

6684.239 --> 6690.44
like it all depends on like how you're

6687.04 --> 6694.239
going to say things what type of then or

6690.44 --> 6696.44
then is going to show up so it's like I

6694.239 --> 6698.718999999999
just approached it differently in my

6696.44 --> 6701.28
head and then I'm getting better so I'm

6698.719 --> 6704.04
making the mistake

6701.28 --> 6707.679
less it was also by the way big pain in

6704.04 --> 6711.719
the ass trying to get the thens correct

6707.679 --> 6715.2390000000005
when I was writing my DND D book

6711.719 --> 6720.28
holy [ __ ] because there's both like time

6715.239 --> 6722.678999999999
based designations as well as ratio

6720.28 --> 6725.28
designations that is like because it's a

6722.679 --> 6726.96
technical book so there's thens and Dan

6725.28 --> 6729.759999999999
all over the freaking place it was

6726.96 --> 6732.199
pretty much a nightmare but I think I

6729.76 --> 6735.76
got most of it right and if I didn't

6732.199 --> 6738.879999999999
well screw it I'm not going to freaking

6735.76 --> 6741.88
rewrite a thousand Pages if you don't

6738.88 --> 6741.88
mind

6744.96 --> 6752.04
I mean just spell correcting

6748.199 --> 6752.04
everything like would take

6753.159 --> 6757.44
hours

6754.76 --> 6760.04
anyway I've already tried doing it for

6757.44 --> 6762.4
so many time so

6760.04 --> 6764.159
long and I'm kind of like done with that

6762.4 --> 6766.159
book I'm not I'm not going to edit it

6764.159 --> 6771.839999999999
any further it's just like yeah I get it

6766.159 --> 6771.839999999999
it's it's dude it's 10 years old

6775.239 --> 6780.239
more like yeah there's no point in

6778.56 --> 6783.0
working on it

6780.239 --> 6785.5199999999995
further people don't really seem to be

6783.0 --> 6788.8
all that caring about

6785.52 --> 6792.2390000000005
it it's it's out there for free you know

6788.8 --> 6796.400000000001
open open source it's like yeah you can

6792.239 --> 6800.5199999999995
have this you don't have to pay me a

6796.4 --> 6805.36
thousand pages of technical text

6800.52 --> 6811.079000000001
redesign it's all there this really

6805.36 --> 6813.48
works like there's a like Divine lawful

6811.079 --> 6816.679
consistency with how I designed

6813.48 --> 6819.48
everything there's a complete Unity of

6816.679 --> 6820.96
how things should be in everything that

6819.48 --> 6825.759999999999
I did in

6820.96 --> 6831.76
there there's a pattern to all of it but

6825.76 --> 6831.76
hey who cares you know

6833.96 --> 6838.719
I really like to use it when I go game

6836.4 --> 6841.36
mastering I like to use my system it

6838.719 --> 6844.639
works absolutely

6841.36 --> 6847.28
perfectly just perfect it is perfect

6844.639 --> 6850.159000000001
it's the best version of Dungeons and

6847.28 --> 6850.159
Dragons

6853.96 --> 6858.92
ever you can't really recognize it

6856.92 --> 6861.679
anymore with the new system because well

6858.92 --> 6864.679
that's not really and Dragons anymore

6861.679 --> 6870.119
it's more like a video
