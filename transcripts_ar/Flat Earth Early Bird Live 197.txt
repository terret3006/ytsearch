7.17 --> 41.28
[Music]

37.399 --> 45.269
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.28 --> 47.760000000000005
early-bird number 197 I'm your host

45.269 --> 50.159
Arwen and before we start the show

47.76 --> 53.82
please don't forget to share it on any

50.159 --> 55.53
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

53.82 --> 57.119
already subscribed to my channel and hit

55.53 --> 59.969
the bell notification so you know when

57.119 --> 65.15899999999999
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

59.969 --> 68.31
p.m. Amsterdam time so today it's it's a

65.159 --> 69.96000000000001
mixed bag of weather like the whole

68.31 --> 73.759
burning it was pretty much raining

69.96 --> 75.80999999999999
constantly but now there's stopped

73.759 --> 79.58
there's still a lot of clouds but

75.81 --> 82.08
there's some blue in between there and

79.58 --> 84.569
yeah the temperature is still kind of

82.08 --> 88.319
warm it's very moist

84.569 --> 89.789
of course the Magpies earlier we're just

88.319 --> 93.95
sitting there during the rain and it

89.789 --> 97.649
looked like totally like flushed cats

93.95 --> 99.509
you know it's like terribly fuzzy and

97.649 --> 103.35
feathers all over the place was Larry's

99.509 --> 106.82900000000001
kind of tragic looking so today I got

103.35 --> 115.829
with me to Mara coffee and tea no

106.829 --> 119.52
edibles man heavy day yesterday been

115.829 --> 123.689
having a lot of happy intense days and I

119.52 --> 125.82
didn't get the game because yeah they

123.689 --> 128.91
couldn't make it last yeah pretty much

125.82 --> 132.03
in last hour and was rescheduled to

128.91 --> 134.19
today so it's gonna happen today and I

132.03 --> 137.64000000000001
yeah but basically redirected all that

134.19 --> 141.39
energy going on Jose's as usual and at

137.64 --> 145.26
an interesting time this time I was

141.39 --> 150.51
Brenda and after that I got faced with a

145.26 --> 152.94
rumpus and it was good it was good yeah

150.51 --> 155.39999999999998
what was interesting to do I thought I

152.94 --> 157.35
managed really well the only problem was

155.4 --> 160.31900000000002
afterward I listened back to the rumpus

157.35 --> 162.9
part and he was constantly like

160.319 --> 167.159
jittering all over the place

162.9 --> 169.5
and that literally didn't make me

167.159 --> 171.32999999999998
audible I you couldn't hear me like most

169.5 --> 174.51
of the time it was quite upsetting

171.33 --> 178.14000000000001
because I was really trying to get with

174.51 --> 180.959
his thing and be just as meticulous to

178.14 --> 183.42
basically prove why it was futile what I

180.959 --> 186.09
was doing but yeah in retrospect I

183.42 --> 187.89
couldn't hear a thing I was saying but

186.09 --> 191.579
it did basically come down to he was

187.89 --> 194.67
trying to trick me by withholding F

191.579 --> 197.489
information of the orientation

194.67 --> 199.29
yeah and trying to make me explain where

197.489 --> 201.989
the density's would be going without

199.29 --> 204.15
that orientation and like that's

201.989 --> 206.43
supposed to mean something and yeah I

204.15 --> 208.87900000000002
was basically figuring out like that's

206.43 --> 213.0
really nice rumpus but for any

208.879 --> 215.879
experiment it is required to have an

213.0 --> 218.819
orientation in the physical world right

215.879 --> 221.25
and in the physical world we have this

218.819 --> 224.909
orientation instantly we don't even have

221.25 --> 227.79
to figure it out and that's the trick so

224.909 --> 231.89999999999998
an antecedent for any experiment is an

227.79 --> 235.2
orientation within the world and that

231.9 --> 239.25
happens per default you don't even think

235.2 --> 241.58999999999997
about it really when you do it but by

239.25 --> 243.9
rumpus basically withholding 3d

241.59 --> 246.06
information presenting a 2d diagram

243.9 --> 248.45000000000002
without telling me the orientation of it

246.06 --> 251.699
I couldn't make out what would happen I

248.45 --> 253.5
would had to assume certain things and

251.699 --> 255.389
you thought that meant something in in

253.5 --> 257.37
respect to the relative density Theory

255.389 --> 259.139
like there's more you need to know yeah

257.37 --> 261.93
you need an orientation you need that

259.139 --> 265.28000000000003
for any experiment it's the antecedent

261.93 --> 270.289
for an experiment is the orientation

265.28 --> 270.289
always so

270.449 --> 279.639
for the actual physical experiment that

273.009 --> 285.19
is you know so that that's basically my

279.639 --> 287.229
afterthought I hope that clears up a lot

285.19 --> 291.96999999999997
about what's going what was going on

287.229 --> 293.949
then so but it was overall satisfying

291.97 --> 296.91900000000004
experience but really if I'm gonna

293.949 --> 299.44
engage in that kind of setup with Korea

296.919 --> 302.40999999999997
controlled by Jose he's gonna absolutely

299.44 --> 305.26
have to give me like maneuver my sound

302.41 --> 307.87
in some way that I'll yeah that will not

305.26 --> 310.479
be blanked out as soon as rumpus start

307.87 --> 313.36
skittering even slightly because that's

310.479 --> 315.25
just not doable that's I can't do

313.36 --> 317.22900000000004
anything that way like he's going to

315.25 --> 323.25
defeat the purpose of the conversation

317.229 --> 323.25
by accident by being rumpus so

330.1 --> 349.28000000000003
okay wow so sorry to hear that Johnny I

338.3 --> 353.289
fell at moments I know not really raise

349.28 --> 353.289
my mic levels what is it that soft

354.16 --> 357.16
dammit

357.46 --> 365.26
okay let me check the audio no it's at

359.59 --> 371.58
180 doesn't okay for that let's not put

365.26 --> 371.58
in 2000 right so this is a little louder

373.11 --> 389.95
does that help anything uh okay back two

384.55 --> 392.28000000000003
hundred and eighty right I thought so

389.95 --> 395.44
yeah my volume it has been pretty fine

392.28 --> 398.44
recently although yeah and other shows

395.44 --> 403.99
it varies what kind of sound how much is

398.44 --> 407.83
gonna come through I haven't had a lot

403.99 --> 410.2
of success with panel talk dominance

407.83 --> 412.33
only something usually the old Mike gave

410.2 --> 417.43
me dominance that was the weird thing

412.33 --> 420.58
about it so weird I was such a simple

417.43 --> 425.97
mic despite the little bit of noise gave

420.58 --> 425.96999999999997
me such a good priority in the system

429.06 --> 432.06
well

432.79 --> 439.27000000000004
so yeah that happened josé's and I kind

437.59 --> 441.07
of finished the rest of my wine it

439.27 --> 452.32
wasn't as much as yesterday so I don't

441.07 --> 454.48
feel as weird now and yeah also had a

452.32 --> 459.43
really nice conversation again with

454.48 --> 462.04
Jessica pretty personal stuff and yeah I

459.43 --> 470.61
feel really do have a bond and yeah it

462.04 --> 475.09000000000003
should confirm that it's like very

470.61 --> 476.53000000000003
strong kindred spirits very close with

475.09 --> 478.84
our hearts I don't know it sounds kind

476.53 --> 485.65
of mushy like that but it's I don't know

478.84 --> 487.53999999999996
yet but yeah I totally enjoy our

485.65 --> 490.34999999999997
conversations and she's just a nice

487.54 --> 493.24
person and even my ealer yet

490.35 --> 495.46000000000004
sounds weird checked her yeah I let my

493.24 --> 497.74
other checks a lot of people that I deal

495.46 --> 499.81
with when I have questions about them

497.74 --> 502.87
and he can just do that he could just

499.81 --> 505.0
literally through my spirit my

502.87 --> 509.43
experience with that people in the

505.0 --> 512.71
situation then lift out the individual

509.43 --> 514.419
their signature and analyze that even

512.71 --> 515.74
though he's never even seen them or

514.419 --> 518.89
heard their voices it's pretty

515.74 --> 521.6800000000001
remarkable how accurate he is every time

518.89 --> 524.74
it's it's mind-blowing that that is even

521.68 --> 530.65
possible but it is possible and anyway

524.74 --> 534.67
yeah Jessica's like really in a

530.65 --> 538.3299999999999
spiritual sense unspoiled goods she's

534.67 --> 541.53
really she is with the path naturally

538.33 --> 541.5300000000001
it's good

542.639 --> 548.47
so maybe a little bit too personal and

545.559 --> 552.429
now that you know add but yeah I really

548.47 --> 555.22
appreciate her being around and being on

552.429 --> 561.759
the panel and our conversations and I

555.22 --> 564.8190000000001
like how she really knows how to dig

561.759 --> 567.069
with me into the deep thinking and write

564.819 --> 570.2489999999999
those thoughts and add something to that

567.069 --> 572.3789999999999
that's it's not a lot of people out

570.249 --> 575.1990000000001
there that can do it that well with

572.379 --> 577.5690000000001
these very complex issues that are just

575.199 --> 581.889
not so straightforward mechanical or

577.569 --> 586.8589999999999
something and yeah it's really relief to

581.889 --> 586.859
be able to communicate on that level hmm

588.419 --> 598.9789999999999
I I don't know James Mason I haven't

592.689 --> 598.9789999999999
asked probably

602.35 --> 607.8100000000001
I think she didn't mention that she

605.5 --> 613.63
doesn't come from like a small family

607.81 --> 624.6389999999999
they're a pretty tight family I think so

613.63 --> 632.8
I don't know I'll ask her anyway that

624.639 --> 634.87
went on pretty late yeah I also went to

632.8 --> 640.8599999999999
the coffee shop again in between that

634.87 --> 643.949
before that again had just another

640.86 --> 646.0
conversation with like four guys that

643.949 --> 647.529
I've never seen before

646.0 --> 650.529
and was interesting they were like

647.529 --> 653.199
really young in just in their 20s just

650.529 --> 655.6
lot just in their 20s and they were they

653.199 --> 660.88
really had that young spirit going and

655.6 --> 663.22
they were smart guys but had issues with

660.88 --> 667.019
that smarts so it's like wow these guys

663.22 --> 670.9490000000001
are like really in the potential and

667.019 --> 676.269
interested and really curious good guys

670.949 --> 678.7299999999999
very young very promising and and not

676.269 --> 682.529
like corrupted like a lot of young

678.73 --> 685.63
people so oh by the way thank you Renee

682.529 --> 688.569
Colusa for the $2 super chat donation

685.63 --> 689.17
I love bombarding children's websites

688.569 --> 698.579
Flat Earth

689.17 --> 701.17
I love these I don't know about that

698.579 --> 703.449
it all depends on the nature of the web

701.17 --> 707.949
sites really there's a time and a place

703.449 --> 710.5
for everything but I think that when

707.949 --> 713.62
there's like information sources that

710.5 --> 717.79
really claim this is the truth when it's

713.62 --> 719.23
obviously yeah like oh the the proof of

717.79 --> 721.48
the molten iron core that kind of

719.23 --> 723.339
stories designated to children yeah

721.48 --> 725.11
definitely those because those are

723.339 --> 728.4390000000001
directly misinformation you should

725.11 --> 731.9490000000001
definitely get in their face if you can

728.439 --> 734.1999999999999
but when it just comes to like Oh a

731.949 --> 740.4699999999999
space experiencers or anything

734.2 --> 746.5600000000001
I don't know you know there's people

740.47 --> 749.1
that are just there to enjoy it I have

746.56 --> 752.079
mixed feelings about it like it's good

749.1 --> 755.019
to like let people be aware that Flat

752.079 --> 757.269
Earth exists but I don't know we

755.019 --> 759.25
shouldn't like shove it in their faces

757.269 --> 759.88
in places where people obviously don't

759.25 --> 766.63
want it

759.88 --> 769.24
it's unless of course it is like a place

766.63 --> 770.9399999999999
where ballers will be discussing Flat

769.24 --> 773.5
Earth that's another matter entirely

770.94 --> 779.639
because then they're basically talking

773.5 --> 782.32
about the subject so I don't know I

779.639 --> 790.8
still appreciate the superjet donation

782.32 --> 790.8000000000001
now but I think that yeah

792.47 --> 798.98
children should definitely be allowed to

795.35 --> 801.5
get a glimpse of Flat Earth at a young

798.98 --> 804.019
age to just see it to just know like

801.5 --> 805.55
yeah there is they can see it however

804.019 --> 810.079
they like maybe they think like ooh

805.55 --> 812.329
there's this weird like these gamers

810.079 --> 815.569
that are trying to build the world that

812.329 --> 817.4899999999999
is like a way a young kid that would

815.569 --> 818.99
really not grasp all of it will be able

817.49 --> 821.66
to see it like oh they're trying to

818.99 --> 826.1
build the world or something in another

821.66 --> 827.689
way and to just know that it's out there

826.1 --> 831.37
even though it's apparently not

827.689 --> 835.069
acceptable it already kind of helps

831.37 --> 837.23
because then there's just this other

835.069 --> 839.209
side every time you're confronted with

837.23 --> 843.23
the information in the back of your mind

839.209 --> 847.04
to make you less tendin to just totally

843.23 --> 850.4300000000001
surrender to it and let it come really

847.04 --> 853.43
close to your soul which then eventually

850.43 --> 855.829
end grains although the global reflexes

853.43 --> 860.3599999999999
that's what that is it's the total trust

855.829 --> 862.189
of the original sensation that had to be

860.36 --> 863.99
true and that is what gets close and

862.189 --> 865.819
that's what makes it hurt eventually to

863.99 --> 867.7090000000001
let yet to let it all go it's because it

865.819 --> 872.709
did came so close they let it happen

867.709 --> 879.8889999999999
like that without yeah any honest

872.709 --> 881.4799999999999
competition basically so yeah in one way

879.889 --> 887.1
confronting children with Flat Earth

881.48 --> 890.299
indeed but do be sensible about it

887.1 --> 890.299
[Music]

902.19 --> 904.759
No

905.38 --> 916.45
right looky Kalin space warped I don't

912.1 --> 918.64
know maybe space could be warped but

916.45 --> 921.4000000000001
that's kind of difficult to figure out

918.64 --> 924.85
like it's like a presuppositional theory

921.4 --> 929.6999999999999
like very science fictiony presuming a

924.85 --> 935.26
certain set up but technically the the

929.7 --> 939.94
warping of space I don't know why would

935.26 --> 942.49
it be possible I'm not saying that all

939.94 --> 945.1
that means that the orange dynein setup

942.49 --> 949.09
is true but in the context of for

945.1 --> 951.22
example a looping element that's also

949.09 --> 954.61
kind of in in the in the field of

951.22 --> 958.78
spatial warping so I don't know if it's

954.61 --> 961.27
not possible I'm not however willing to

958.78 --> 964.2099999999999
assume that like that bending of space

961.27 --> 966.79
or we'd suppose it gravity or mass at

964.21 --> 969.46
that critical mass will somehow then

966.79 --> 971.92
cause time to bend as well because

969.46 --> 974.95
that's a whole different approach but as

971.92 --> 976.5999999999999
for get a concept of space bending I'm

974.95 --> 980.9200000000001
not excluding that that could be

976.6 --> 985.03
possible in some way and confirmable at

980.92 --> 987.3
it but currently there is no direct

985.03 --> 990.8199999999999
confirmation of that only

987.3 --> 993.76
presuppositions several directions the

990.82 --> 997.72
Einstein in presupposition presupposing

993.76 --> 999.7
a lot more at it and my looping concept

997.72 --> 1002.0400000000001
within the rectangular looping world and

999.7 --> 1004.6500000000001
it's also a presupposition and I fully

1002.04 --> 1009.7099999999999
admit that every time but it could be

1004.65 --> 1009.7099999999999
confirmed so yeah

1013.9 --> 1024.22
Newton's third law no but look Newton

1020.11 --> 1027.28
only deals with physical things in

1024.22 --> 1030.49
relation to space that's the thing but

1027.28 --> 1033.22
if there's no physical thing it's just

1030.49 --> 1035.29
the space then that kind of falls

1033.22 --> 1038.47
outside of Newton laws because Newton

1035.29 --> 1043.0
only deals with the laws of physical

1038.47 --> 1045.88
matter relating to spatial factors see

1043.0 --> 1048.78
it so it doesn't really work like that

1045.88 --> 1048.7800000000002
look II can

1059.22 --> 1062.38
[Music]

1071.52 --> 1079.41
okay explain that to me magnetic field

1075.57 --> 1083.809
is immaterial as well and it obeys

1079.41 --> 1083.809
Newton's third law okay

1099.15 --> 1105.48
well yeah look even that doesn't that

1103.74 --> 1108.84
doesn't disprove what I said by the way

1105.48 --> 1111.63
because yeah maybe a magnetic field

1108.84 --> 1114.09
could be considered a material and yeah

1111.63 --> 1119.5400000000002
it may abide to that law but that

1114.09 --> 1122.28
doesn't really mean much because it is

1119.54 --> 1124.5
outside of the field and just because it

1122.28 --> 1132.23
happens to work out the same way it

1124.5 --> 1137.61
doesn't mean that it's it's just it's

1132.23 --> 1139.41
just very muddied up like that doesn't

1137.61 --> 1142.9799999999998
matter that magnetic fields obey

1139.41 --> 1145.5500000000002
Newton's third law not relevant to

1142.98 --> 1145.55
Newton's law

1148.81 --> 1156.8799999999999
right yeah Billy was a look I'm just

1154.39 --> 1160.5700000000002
aiming for something and as it all rolls

1156.88 --> 1162.8500000000001
in I will be able to yeah decide at any

1160.57 --> 1165.79
point basically say okay I'm gonna go

1162.85 --> 1168.52
for this now with what's in so maybe at

1165.79 --> 1172.48
some point things will not rise too far

1168.52 --> 1174.73
above yeah that 400 pounds you say and

1172.48 --> 1178.27
I'll just get it I don't know but I'm

1174.73 --> 1180.67
now set for the p1000 and I know that if

1178.27 --> 1182.74
that total amount will come in I will we

1180.67 --> 1187.99
literally be able to get it for that

1182.74 --> 1190.1200000000001
price whenever that time comes and

1187.99 --> 1193.39
that's why I preset that price but I'm a

1190.12 --> 1198.27
yeah at some point decide to yeah get a

1193.39 --> 1201.8700000000001
p900 with whatever I got at the time so

1198.27 --> 1201.87
it's up to you guys

1211.63 --> 1220.8100000000002
why do you keep calling me are when Theo

1214.73 --> 1220.81
Megawati it's really weird

1239.36 --> 1260.57
no thanks don't threader I don't need a

1241.429 --> 1262.669
GoPro camera based system thank you all

1260.57 --> 1264.23
right well Lu okay your question is

1262.669 --> 1265.489
about supposed yeah you're presupposing

1264.23 --> 1268.97
paid rolls

1265.489 --> 1273.259
I don't presuppose that but I do think

1268.97 --> 1278.419
that there may be like just incentive

1273.259 --> 1281.3890000000001
for those like corporate moral support

1278.419 --> 1284.96
basically for those that do defend the

1281.389 --> 1286.9089999999999
globe so it's like corporately

1284.96 --> 1289.039
politicized at that but I don't think

1286.909 --> 1291.71
these people are literally like face to

1289.039 --> 1294.95
face like oh yeah will you defend the

1291.71 --> 1297.019
globe I will pay you this they may have

1294.95 --> 1299.179
been like oh yeah this is a viable

1297.019 --> 1301.73
market if you do that you will be very

1299.179 --> 1304.789
likely to get money because the

1301.73 --> 1307.669
corporation's like it they kind of want

1304.789 --> 1309.95
it so they will give you priority and

1307.669 --> 1311.72
more opportunities that's probably the

1309.95 --> 1312.5900000000001
story to them but nobody's literally

1311.72 --> 1315.049
like oh yeah

1312.59 --> 1316.999
you're gonna do globe well here's the

1315.049 --> 1320.57
contract I will pay you this amount

1316.999 --> 1324.909
every time you do this in this no that

1320.57 --> 1332.98
doesn't happen it it's just designed to

1324.909 --> 1336.1090000000002
naturally accommodate for what people do

1332.98 --> 1338.359
so it's still just completely voluntary

1336.109 --> 1341.08
based is just given an incentive to

1338.359 --> 1341.08
motivate it

1341.36 --> 1344.59
[Music]

1353.77 --> 1358.6399999999999
well you know what maybe I don't know

1356.66 --> 1360.799
maybe with the science teachers with the

1358.64 --> 1364.91
actual science teachers it's a different

1360.799 --> 1368.02
thing maybe they have been like told

1364.91 --> 1370.76
like maybe it's a good idea to go on

1368.02 --> 1372.59
YouTube with those science and get

1370.76 --> 1375.799
together there's kind of a debate going

1372.59 --> 1377.9599999999998
on and science needs some intellectual

1375.799 --> 1381.559
defenders maybe that one specific

1377.96 --> 1390.3500000000001
teacher account that they did get kind

1381.559 --> 1392.27
of like like an internal Congress not

1390.35 --> 1394.52
the government but in with the group

1392.27 --> 1396.74
with a group of teachers in that field

1394.52 --> 1401.51
that there's like okay yeah maybe we

1396.74 --> 1405.02
should do that but regular people no no

1401.51 --> 1408.85
no way they may have been tempted by the

1405.02 --> 1412.46
opportunity from YouTube because of the

1408.85 --> 1420.26
political preferencing from from the

1412.46 --> 1422.8600000000001
corporate systems but no so maybe

1420.26 --> 1422.86
teachers

1430.77 --> 1435.2
what quite I answered your question

1433.46 --> 1438.72
right

1435.2 --> 1441.17
extremely elaborately a lianca so what's

1438.72 --> 1441.17
the problem

1448.34 --> 1455.76
Simon Dan and doctor grandi I don't even

1451.59 --> 1460.4399999999998
know who dr. grandia's Simon Dan no he

1455.76 --> 1471.96
is absolutely that opportunist guy he is

1460.44 --> 1473.3
a he's he's doing it yeah but yeah for

1471.96 --> 1476.55
the opportunity

1473.3 --> 1479.12
nobody ordered him to do that it's

1476.55 --> 1479.12
ridiculous

1491.659 --> 1496.919
right patron from Lyon what would I do

1494.369 --> 1501.299
with a with one of those cameras oh yeah

1496.919 --> 1505.94
well for starters I would start to

1501.299 --> 1508.649
restart my moon my moon gazing series

1505.94 --> 1510.989
there's some real functionality instead

1508.649 --> 1513.6589999999999
of just looking at that little blip on

1510.989 --> 1516.179
my webcam every time and comments

1513.659 --> 1518.519
because yeah that's getting old and

1516.179 --> 1521.669
useless so I can we get real moon

1518.519 --> 1524.46
footage and close up and potentially

1521.669 --> 1527.1290000000001
observe celestial phenomena because I

1524.46 --> 1532.1390000000001
see with my eyes which are very good

1527.129 --> 1536.1899999999998
eyes I see a lot of yeah celestial

1532.139 --> 1538.1689999999999
phenomena very clearly and when I catch

1536.19 --> 1540.6290000000001
that and if I have that camera you can

1538.169 --> 1543.2990000000002
just set it up quickly and try to catch

1540.629 --> 1546.029
that and with the webcam I just couldn't

1543.299 --> 1547.4089999999999
do that at all not even close so that is

1546.029 --> 1550.619
one of the first things I could do with

1547.409 --> 1554.479
it and then of course once it really

1550.619 --> 1558.149
gets going if I get yeah

1554.479 --> 1561.809
more travelling opportunity or financial

1558.149 --> 1563.9089999999999
related probably then I could yeah go

1561.809 --> 1566.58
and travel with it and do similar stuff

1563.909 --> 1569.279
as to what Randy's been doing and one of

1566.58 --> 1573.299
my plans that I did have pretty early on

1569.279 --> 1575.309
is go to the Northwest tip of the

1573.299 --> 1578.7
Netherlands where there's like islands

1575.309 --> 1580.789
across and then try to do some horizon

1578.7 --> 1583.979
footage there at the coast

1580.789 --> 1585.719
see see of what it looks like that's for

1583.979 --> 1587.489
starters and who knows where I could go

1585.719 --> 1590.8690000000001
with that camera there's all kinds of

1587.489 --> 1594.1490000000001
interesting things you could do with it

1590.869 --> 1596.4499999999998
so yeah that's what I would do with that

1594.149 --> 1596.4499999999998
camera

1600.07 --> 1605.51
now it's not two hundred thirty five

1603.44 --> 1609.26
thousand miles away than Island

1605.51 --> 1611.68
definitely not that distance no that's

1609.26 --> 1611.68
ridiculous

1620.53 --> 1626.48
right so yeah if you like the idea of me

1623.78 --> 1629.06
doing that and having that in between my

1626.48 --> 1633.14
videos as well sometimes life presented

1629.06 --> 1635.51
maybe or like uploaded sometimes I would

1633.14 --> 1637.22
play maybe could play some of that video

1635.51 --> 1639.98
in my early bird show

1637.22 --> 1643.91
fill it up a little but it's something

1639.98 --> 1646.07
else than me just talking and panelists

1643.91 --> 1650.3300000000002
so yeah if you like that then please

1646.07 --> 1654.4399999999998
donate just look in the description box

1650.33 --> 1661.96
below there's a GoFundMe link and yeah

1654.44 --> 1661.96
help me fill that up and it'll happen

1666.7 --> 1673.72
and yeah beside that even if I had a

1670.869 --> 1675.759
good camera like this like finally a

1673.72 --> 1679.049
real camera because I did have a camera

1675.759 --> 1682.659
before I had a camera for several hobby

1679.049 --> 1686.1689999999999
well from a profession even because I

1682.659 --> 1688.69
used yeah I made jewelry you know like

1686.169 --> 1691.6290000000001
my ring and everything and you have to

1688.69 --> 1693.94
have proper photographs for that and on

1691.629 --> 1696.2489999999998
my symbolic Sutton L side I still have

1693.94 --> 1699.789
those photographs that I made of these

1696.249 --> 1703.6000000000001
jewelry so I'd make yeah I have

1699.789 --> 1705.669
photographic experience professionally

1703.6 --> 1708.4889999999998
even you could call it with self-made

1705.669 --> 1710.489
and but my camera sucked the batteries

1708.489 --> 1713.3500000000001
just ran out of like after half an hour

1710.489 --> 1715.179
after two years of use even though it

1713.35 --> 1720.519
was pretty decent does that just sucks

1715.179 --> 1723.1000000000001
and I kind of lost interest after that

1720.519 --> 1724.629
and I didn't latch on to the Mobile's

1723.1 --> 1727.539
that have all the proper camera

1724.629 --> 1729.369
functions so that it kind of like I lost

1727.539 --> 1731.619
sight of doing that whenever I have a

1729.369 --> 1733.269
real series a good camera I can

1731.619 --> 1736.779
basically pick it up again and just

1733.269 --> 1740.44
photograph awesome things and very

1736.779 --> 1744.159
special sights also so that's some

1740.44 --> 1747.46
things that I can also do and even use

1744.159 --> 1750.2990000000002
that like use the just beautiful

1747.46 --> 1755.259
pictures for potential slideshows

1750.299 --> 1759.359
whatever I can do a lot with a good

1755.259 --> 1763.63
camera so please donate to my GoFundMe

1759.359 --> 1764.879
the link is in the description box below

1763.63 --> 1769.0490000000002
[Music]

1764.879 --> 1769.049
P 1000 for Arwen

1773.83 --> 1778.02
[Music]

1786.32 --> 1792.1799999999998
right well arena Columbo

1788.97 --> 1794.4
I never really got into the how do you

1792.18 --> 1799.01
say the terminologies of photography

1794.4 --> 1801.5700000000002
much I'm I'm much a doer guy I just

1799.01 --> 1804.3
fiddled with settings and basically

1801.57 --> 1807.57
figure out by trial and error what was

1804.3 --> 1809.94
gonna happen I never like talked with

1807.57 --> 1811.6499999999999
other photographers or got lessons it no

1809.94 --> 1815.79
I just got a frickin camera and just

1811.65 --> 1820.0700000000002
tried out [ __ ] and before I did like a

1815.79 --> 1822.6
white photography even also separately

1820.07 --> 1824.58
and it was even in the time when you

1822.6 --> 1827.34
would have to literally develop the

1824.58 --> 1836.37
camera roll so before all the digital

1827.34 --> 1838.23
photography I did all that so no not

1836.37 --> 1844.6499999999999
professional but I did apply it

1838.23 --> 1847.1100000000001
professionally I did use it in yeah in

1844.65 --> 1849.77
in my goldsmithing company I you know I

1847.11 --> 1853.8
had a fishel company I did sell things

1849.77 --> 1862.61
is our record and my own photography was

1853.8 --> 1866.34
a part of it and I did get tips about

1862.61 --> 1868.77
making good for photographs though

1866.34 --> 1871.4099999999999
practical tips but I never really got

1868.77 --> 1875.46
like into the mechanics and the names of

1871.41 --> 1879.3200000000002
all the things because this a lot so I

1875.46 --> 1879.32
just did it more intuitively

1892.01 --> 1900.25
hmm that's funny Theo Megawati yeah true

1896.15 --> 1904.2800000000002
what also really works well is having

1900.25 --> 1907.4
boots with steel noses which I have with

1904.28 --> 1910.25
me at all time and I prefer to use those

1907.4 --> 1912.23
instead of my expensive camera that also

1910.25 --> 1914.5
kind of very likely be damaged if I do

1912.23 --> 1914.5
that

1952.41 --> 1957.49
right

1954.89 --> 1957.49
yeah

1957.63 --> 1963.7800000000002
it's ridiculous come on betta familiar

1960.54 --> 1968.37
you should know better doesn't work that

1963.78 --> 1972.36
way you're trying to compare an

1968.37 --> 1975.9899999999998
autograph ik few to an actual view

1972.36 --> 1977.61
that's your you're performing wizardry

1975.99 --> 1982.22
that that's trickery what you're doing

1977.61 --> 1982.2199999999998
right there it's nonsense

1989.94 --> 1995.3700000000001
if you're gonna look at something really

1991.77 --> 1999.2
big there's also there's yeah even

1995.37 --> 2001.55
though it doesn't explain the standard

1999.2 --> 2003.95
concealment that is always noticed when

2001.55 --> 2005.99
you look over a flat surface if your

2003.95 --> 2010.8500000000001
proximity to that flat surface is low

2005.99 --> 2014.6
enough despite that there is still the

2010.85 --> 2017.87
limited viewing angle at play and when

2014.6 --> 2019.37
you have a camera facing forward at a

2017.87 --> 2021.02
hundred meter distance looking at a

2019.37 --> 2024.62
hundred metre building it's very likely

2021.02 --> 2028.25
that the top will not be caught on it

2024.62 --> 2029.9899999999998
because and I don't even know what

2028.25 --> 2033.44
you're freaking zoom is and everything I

2029.99 --> 2035.99
don't know it's just a total yeah you're

2033.44 --> 2038.41
attracted before wizardry here I don't

2035.99 --> 2038.41
do that

2055.59 --> 2059.21
yes there are Daniel

2061.37 --> 2065.81
and you were there in chat when that

2063.92 --> 2067.55
happened that we had the same

2065.81 --> 2070.43
conversation yesterday if you're just

2067.55 --> 2074.1200000000003
gonna say no I'm gonna get really pissed

2070.43 --> 2077.3599999999997
off because I was there we spent like a

2074.12 --> 2080.48
week on that [ __ ] showing every day

2077.36 --> 2082.88
several clips on several skills how

2080.48 --> 2084.86
things would always become obstructed

2082.88 --> 2088.9700000000003
even though it's a confirmed flat

2084.86 --> 2091.1600000000003
surface and I'm just sick I'm really

2088.97 --> 2094.3399999999997
getting pissed off at Globus that just

2091.16 --> 2095.96
say no it doesn't happen like you really

2094.34 --> 2098.21
deserve a punch in the face for that

2095.96 --> 2100.9700000000003
just to snap you out of it because

2098.21 --> 2104.09
you're literally lying to yourself and

2100.97 --> 2106.2099999999996
the world in plain sight every time you

2104.09 --> 2110.06
say that it does happen

2106.21 --> 2113.2400000000002
confirmed flat surface low proximity to

2110.06 --> 2117.2
it looking over it the end of it is

2113.24 --> 2118.7599999999998
concealed by an obstruction apparent

2117.2 --> 2122.24
obstruction a concealment

2118.76 --> 2125.8100000000004
and confirmed flat that's just the

2122.24 --> 2127.8399999999997
freakin reality I'm sorry it's what it

2125.81 --> 2127.84
is

2132.17 --> 2139.109
and to even claim the cost for it is

2135.359 --> 2142.08
kind of futile because the thing is it

2139.109 --> 2143.369
always happens it doesn't even matter

2142.08 --> 2147.24
what causes it

2143.369 --> 2149.7000000000003
because we know it happens on a flat

2147.24 --> 2153.839
surface so that means it's pretty much

2149.7 --> 2155.8489999999997
always gonna happen and to say oh it

2153.839 --> 2157.41
would always happen on a globe is just

2155.849 --> 2159.38
completely irrelevant because it

2157.41 --> 2163.29
wouldn't happen on a flat earth as

2159.38 --> 2165.2400000000002
demonstrated a flat surface right it's a

2163.29 --> 2165.599
flat surface on the short-run the longer

2165.24 --> 2170.8999999999996
run

2165.599 --> 2170.9
well that then applies to everything

2175.339 --> 2184.17
right no I'm just sick of this cognitive

2182.49 --> 2185.7299999999996
dissonance [ __ ] about your

2184.17 --> 2189.089
declarations of what should not be

2185.73 --> 2191.13
possible on a flat earth because you

2189.089 --> 2194.64
basically assume that the earth cannot

2191.13 --> 2196.9700000000003
be flat thus the way the earth would be

2194.64 --> 2200.73
flat in your conceptualization is

2196.97 --> 2203.8199999999997
literally per default off from what the

2200.73 --> 2205.44
real world you from what you experience

2203.82 --> 2207.4500000000003
that's what happening in your mind so

2205.44 --> 2210.2400000000002
your per default dismissing Flat Earth

2207.45 --> 2212.1299999999997
because the earth cannot be like a flat

2210.24 --> 2215.5499999999997
earth because the earth it must be a

2212.13 --> 2217.8
ball and therefore you constantly assume

2215.55 --> 2220.1090000000004
these things would not happen on the

2217.8 --> 2222.21
flat earth because we see them and the

2220.109 --> 2224.49
earth is a freaking ball that's what

2222.21 --> 2227.82
you're doing over and over and over

2224.49 --> 2234.72
again I'm sick of it snap out of it you

2227.82 --> 2238.1400000000003
freaking lunatics I'm sick of the insane

2234.72 --> 2240.6299999999997
automated politicized manipulation [ __ ]

2238.14 --> 2243.21
that's coming out of you you don't even

2240.63 --> 2251.04
realize you're doing it I'm sick of it

2243.21 --> 2255.39
stop it wake the [ __ ] up I did explain

2251.04 --> 2258.9
it literally loudly just now

2255.39 --> 2260.79
pater from Llewyn you deserve a punch in

2258.9 --> 2266.9900000000002
the face for that remark you freaking

2260.79 --> 2266.99
lunatic I just explained it let

2269.93 --> 2273.19
[Music]

2277.63 --> 2280.9790000000003
[Music]

2283.03 --> 2290.829
[Music]

2290.99 --> 2296.25
look I appreciate having some glowers

2294.119 --> 2298.9500000000003
around in my chat that do have some like

2296.25 --> 2301.98
relevant things to say or questions or

2298.95 --> 2306.1189999999997
tests right but if you're just gonna

2301.98 --> 2309.059
outright say no this is not true despite

2306.119 --> 2313.6400000000003
that I have basically been involved with

2309.059 --> 2316.5
a vast presentation of evidence

2313.64 --> 2319.98
empirical observation based evidence

2316.5 --> 2322.68
that supports that claim and I'm sick of

2319.98 --> 2324.98
the dismissal of it I'm really sick of

2322.68 --> 2324.98
it

2330.21 --> 2333.309
[Music]

2344.74 --> 2351.22
if you want to find some real curvature

2347.69 --> 2354.7000000000003
well then find that cumulative drop rate

2351.22 --> 2357.7099999999996
right because if you assume that that

2354.7 --> 2360.5
obstruction that I just explained is

2357.71 --> 2363.829
naturally present over a flat surface

2360.5 --> 2365.93
right with observation if you're gonna

2363.829 --> 2369.319
claim that's curvature then you're gonna

2365.93 --> 2372.8289999999997
have to prove certain geometrical things

2369.319 --> 2375.44
about that namely that the obstruction

2372.829 --> 2377.75
rate would have to be exponential

2375.44 --> 2379.9700000000003
because that's required in geometrical

2377.75 --> 2384.41
curvature so where is the cumulative

2379.97 --> 2386.24
dropping obstruction rate and don't

2384.41 --> 2388.46
trick us with things in the distance

2386.24 --> 2393.2599999999998
literally being much smaller so

2388.46 --> 2396.4700000000003
therefore you assume autographic system

2393.26 --> 2398.329
and it must therefore be curvature no

2396.47 --> 2401.7799999999997
you're gonna have to pile it up together

2398.329 --> 2403.88
and then find that exponential drop rate

2401.78 --> 2406.69
you'll notice it's not there it's only

2403.88 --> 2409.76
there if you first exclude perspective

2406.69 --> 2412.069
that's what's the foundation of the

2409.76 --> 2419.5690000000004
curvature calculator as we all know and

2412.069 --> 2421.97
have talked about for years so yeah look

2419.569 --> 2424.16
if you guys keep on doing that I'm

2421.97 --> 2426.9199999999996
probably gonna have to ask Nathan like

2424.16 --> 2430.3689999999997
ki could you dig me out the links of

2426.92 --> 2433.339
those videos I know see if I can like

2430.369 --> 2435.859
compile it maybe present it to be over

2433.339 --> 2437.3289999999997
with it because I am NOT I've never been

2435.859 --> 2439.5789999999997
a guy that's really like being

2437.329 --> 2442.25
collecting videos at a certain point I

2439.579 --> 2444.1400000000003
just stopped doing that because I still

2442.25 --> 2446.24
have part of my browser that is so

2444.14 --> 2447.95
filled up with so many Flat Earth

2446.24 --> 2451.22
related videos it just couldn't keep

2447.95 --> 2454.64
track anymore so I I didn't really build

2451.22 --> 2458.2099999999996
a database of sensible evidence and I'm

2454.64 --> 2460.49
kind of sad that I didn't because now I

2458.21 --> 2462.95
just have to do pretty much the moments

2460.49 --> 2465.1699999999996
in my memory to reference but I don't

2462.95 --> 2467.6699999999996
have like all these videos directly at

2465.17 --> 2473.819
hand and it's kind of

2467.67 --> 2476.099
makes me sad a little sometimes but yeah

2473.819 --> 2477.989
I swear to you I I'm not making any of

2476.099 --> 2479.7290000000003
this [ __ ] up if I'm gonna reference

2477.989 --> 2481.92
something that supposedly happened on

2479.729 --> 2484.6499999999996
the debates you will bet your you could

2481.92 --> 2487.589
bet your ass that it was literally like

2484.65 --> 2489.69
that on the debates my memory doesn't

2487.589 --> 2492.569
warp things around I don't allow it to

2489.69 --> 2495.4500000000003
do that I prefer just not to mention

2492.569 --> 2497.7889999999998
something if my mind will be kind of

2495.45 --> 2499.259
like pushed into warping it around just

2497.789 --> 2500.969
for the argument sakes I just don't

2499.259 --> 2503.67
mention it if that's the case but if

2500.969 --> 2507.059
it's literally directly on target

2503.67 --> 2510.1800000000003
unblemished then I will mention it and

2507.059 --> 2512.7000000000003
this is one of those cases we were

2510.18 --> 2516.269
spending weeks on the debates with that

2512.7 --> 2519.089
like with Riley with ranty others Jose

2516.269 --> 2521.0989999999997
was in that period he was still like it

2519.089 --> 2523.41
was supposed to flat earther back then

2521.099 --> 2526.759
it was in that period basically before

2523.41 --> 2529.499
Jose started doing his open panel thing

2526.759 --> 2534.93
that's the time when we were discussing

2529.499 --> 2540.779
that so if you really want to know you

2534.93 --> 2545.64
can dig back yeah thanks Billy wasa but

2540.779 --> 2548.94
please look there's an issue with the

2545.64 --> 2552.1189999999997
super Jets right I I like the idea but

2548.94 --> 2554.699
so far okay I don't know if this came

2552.119 --> 2556.38
through to everyone if people spread the

2554.699 --> 2559.109
word but yeah the freaking government

2556.38 --> 2562.949
literally took every cent I got from

2559.109 --> 2565.529
Google so far so if you're gonna give me

2562.949 --> 2567.66
five pounds to wear the p1000 through

2565.529 --> 2569.579
the super chat I literally cannot

2567.66 --> 2571.769
guarantee that a cent of it will

2569.579 --> 2573.569
actually go to the p1000 so if you

2571.769 --> 2576.6899999999996
directly want to support it then please

2573.569 --> 2580.769
donate to my GoFundMe in the description

2576.69 --> 2584.48
box below but I definitely appreciate

2580.769 --> 2600.49
the gesture thank you but it was that

2584.48 --> 2605.6
oh the clover trolls are just

2600.49 --> 2609.16
unrepentant it's terrible can't believe

2605.6 --> 2609.16
you allow yourself to do all that

2616.65 --> 2623.9700000000003
oh yeah yeah but Daniel again yeah the

2620.82 --> 2627.2400000000002
angle of attack right and the idea of

2623.97 --> 2630.9599999999996
the resolution limit all that yeah it is

2627.24 --> 2633.2999999999997
not sufficient to explain what causes

2630.96 --> 2635.4
the standard concealment when looking

2633.3 --> 2639.51
over a flat surface it doesn't fully

2635.4 --> 2642.39
explain it absolutely agreed on that but

2639.51 --> 2647.28
here's the thing it's not relevant to

2642.39 --> 2649.98
the fact that you always see that in a

2647.28 --> 2654.1800000000003
consistent manner including when looking

2649.98 --> 2656.28
over a flat surface so yeah it's not

2654.18 --> 2659.1
completely caused by the limited viewing

2656.28 --> 2662.34
angle yeah it the resolution limit it

2659.1 --> 2664.46
does apply somewhere definitely but not

2662.34 --> 2667.9500000000003
in all cases where it's still observed

2664.46 --> 2670.32
but yeah that's like oh sorry sorry we

2667.95 --> 2674.1499999999996
don't exactly know what causes this what

2670.32 --> 2678.48
we do know however is that it is always

2674.15 --> 2682.62
there including when you look over flat

2678.48 --> 2686.54
surfaces yeah and that's kind of

2682.62 --> 2693.69
important to realize now isn't it hmm

2686.54 --> 2695.79
so let's drop that okay yeah we have

2693.69 --> 2697.55
still have some more work to figure out

2695.79 --> 2701.88
optics that's right

2697.55 --> 2703.4700000000003
and it's not just those things that we

2701.88 --> 2705.57
came up with that are real things that

2703.47 --> 2708.3599999999997
will have influence but it's not just

2705.57 --> 2711.7200000000003
that there's more things to it that may

2708.36 --> 2714.33
be very complex how it really works but

2711.72 --> 2717.7999999999997
the thing is it is extremely persistent

2714.33 --> 2723.39
and regular it is definitely a

2717.8 --> 2727.05
measurable consistent phenomena and you

2723.39 --> 2732.93
there is not a time when these effects

2727.05 --> 2738.0600000000004
do not happen in that setup including

2732.93 --> 2742.25
looking over long flat surfaces so let's

2738.06 --> 2744.57
just drop that freaking cause strawman

2742.25 --> 2747.74
because we don't know the full cost we

2744.57 --> 2747.7400000000002
just know it's always there

2754.51 --> 2763.3
oh dear John Smith well that would kind

2759.19 --> 2766.81
of like completely derail this this

2763.3 --> 2769.0600000000004
media this medium that I've been doing

2766.81 --> 2772.5099999999998
here if I do that and I have considered

2769.06 --> 2777.43
it though right

2772.51 --> 2779.38
so I do mention those things at time but

2777.43 --> 2784.56
if I would just fully focus on that

2779.38 --> 2788.7400000000002
stuff it would seriously it would put me

2784.56 --> 2791.0499999999997
inside of groups that I really don't

2788.74 --> 2793.75
have a lot of benefit in my current

2791.05 --> 2796.3300000000004
position to be confronted with because

2793.75 --> 2798.97
they'll just be all a political right

2796.33 --> 2800.23
winger and he's crazy flat earther as

2798.97 --> 2801.6699999999996
well because they don't give a [ __ ]

2800.23 --> 2803.47
about the truth they're just going for

2801.67 --> 2808.66
the stamps and they'll totally try to

2803.47 --> 2811.06
crush me probably so I had consider like

2808.66 --> 2814.6
before Flat Earth even happened I was

2811.06 --> 2816.82
like in chats on the Alex Jones the

2814.6 --> 2818.71
websites and everything which were still

2816.82 --> 2820.15
kind of flexible and open and

2818.71 --> 2821.92
interesting a very long chat

2820.15 --> 2824.71
conversations in the comment sections

2821.92 --> 2826.69
there and I was like that guy that was

2824.71 --> 2829.9900000000002
like oh man I wish I could be a reporter

2826.69 --> 2833.7400000000002
for info worse on things in Europe but

2829.99 --> 2835.6899999999996
then flat earth happened I figured it

2833.74 --> 2837.7599999999998
out I started talking about it in chats

2835.69 --> 2843.61
and basically figured that's never gonna

2837.76 --> 2847.42
work it's like it's two conflicting the

2843.61 --> 2849.9100000000003
stories don't mix well it's it's

2847.42 --> 2853.56
breaking whatever's going on in this

2849.91 --> 2856.12
specific narrative region so yeah I

2853.56 --> 2858.82
can't really combine it I can mention

2856.12 --> 2862.99
some of it basically give my honest

2858.82 --> 2866.8500000000004
opinion in a kind of neutral fashion but

2862.99 --> 2866.85
really becoming like a full-on

2867.98 --> 2872.39
political agents still have to call it

2870.56 --> 2876.349
that for a certain type of cause even

2872.39 --> 2881.359
though that cause is really just that's

2876.349 --> 2884.81
just it's gonna change everything and I

2881.359 --> 2893.39
did I don't think that would be a smart

2884.81 --> 2895.64
thing to do for me right now so I much

2893.39 --> 2898.52
more prefer to really dig into this

2895.64 --> 2903.56
cosmogony because I have a unique talent

2898.52 --> 2907.28
for it I think and even though I might

2903.56 --> 2910.2799999999997
do good being on that yeah the the

2907.28 --> 2912.5600000000004
political right wing side being part of

2910.28 --> 2915.23
that I could definitely do that and have

2912.56 --> 2921.619
the passion I have the conviction but

2915.23 --> 2924.89
I'm also I'm not very easily politicized

2921.619 --> 2928.07
I will always i'd like i always do i

2924.89 --> 2930.41
like even with flat earth i'd like if

2928.07 --> 2932.75
somebody's doing something wrong i will

2930.41 --> 2935.3289999999997
be freaking pointing out of it even if

2932.75 --> 2938.56
like I'm not supposed to according to

2935.329 --> 2941.75
the flow of the social dynamics and that

2938.56 --> 2945.74
what happened to if I was kind of

2941.75 --> 2948.28
reporter for for example Infowars and I

2945.74 --> 2950.45
don't know if they appreciate that and

2948.28 --> 2953.1800000000003
they'd probably at this point and be

2950.45 --> 2955.16
very scared even for me to like know if

2953.18 --> 2957.47
he's no no please don't bring your flat

2955.16 --> 2961.6299999999997
earth or something you know probably not

2957.47 --> 2961.6299999999997
gonna do it so next

2969.97 --> 2982.2799999999997
yeah you go go and watch it Daniel you

2974.27 --> 2986.47
go and do your investigation right so

2982.28 --> 2986.4700000000003
I'm looking for your question l Janka

2987.369 --> 2990.369
suggestion

3000.32 --> 3009.71
right el único you know what could be

3005.98 --> 3012.77
your suggestion it's only possible on a

3009.71 --> 3015.11
flat plane well the thing is you can't

3012.77 --> 3018.08
really test it now with can you because

3015.11 --> 3021.35
you can't really change the shape of the

3018.08 --> 3028.25
earth in order to prove that that's a

3021.35 --> 3031.61
problem about it but I'm just saying

3028.25 --> 3033.44
that effect is present whether the

3031.61 --> 3035.9300000000003
surface you're looking over in this case

3033.44 --> 3038.9
the earth is flat or round the effect

3035.93 --> 3040.8799999999997
will be there it will simply be

3038.9 --> 3043.28
aggravated when looking over a cursed

3040.88 --> 3044.92
surface and there comes the exponential

3043.28 --> 3047.7200000000003
drop rate so where is it

3044.92 --> 3061.1
show me that expense exponential drop

3047.72 --> 3066.7999999999997
rate so there's my suggestion how please

3061.1 --> 3070.16
Lukey Cale and down Beezus you think

3066.8 --> 3072.6200000000003
that was like serious like it's like a

3070.16 --> 3077.29
scientific statement what I made there

3072.62 --> 3080.45
it was a freaking joke you idiot come on

3077.29 --> 3083.93
space-time trampoline it's just an

3080.45 --> 3086.0
analogy using their original suppose the

3083.93 --> 3088.5499999999997
demonstration of the conceptualization

3086.0 --> 3090.76
of it it's like an intricate joke come

3088.55 --> 3090.76
on

3102.92 --> 3108.62
oh well claimed that that wasn't me

3105.29 --> 3110.42
saying that I asked that is that there

3108.62 --> 3113.21
were other people that said that was

3110.42 --> 3116.21
possible and I basically trusted them on

3113.21 --> 3122.96
that for the sake of the argument so I

3116.21 --> 3126.62
don't I I forgot feel for the workings

3122.96 --> 3129.2
of electricity basically roughly but I I

3126.62 --> 3131.06
don't know all the typical mechanical

3129.2 --> 3134.48
details I'm not an end electrical

3131.06 --> 3137.42
engineer at that so still have to trust

3134.48 --> 3140.11
um while people that do know all these

3137.42 --> 3143.39
things in order to get that information

3140.11 --> 3147.23
because I'm not an electrician but I

3143.39 --> 3150.56
yeah I do have a general feel for what

3147.23 --> 3152.15
it is conceptualization of it but I

3150.56 --> 3154.46
don't know any to everything about it

3152.15 --> 3158.53
all these unique effects that can happen

3154.46 --> 3158.53
in certain setups and everything so

3170.16 --> 3177.839
all right right it's an uneven floor

3174.75 --> 3180.0
it's not flat it's it's too wobbly nurse

3177.839 --> 3182.19
because everything must has Bob leanness

3180.0 --> 3184.849
and then you basically claim that the

3182.19 --> 3188.099
limited viewing angle is the fall right

3184.849 --> 3190.2000000000003
even though we even explained earlier

3188.099 --> 3192.75
that the limited viewing angle is not

3190.2 --> 3196.9199999999996
even that relevant in the overall effect

3192.75 --> 3199.13
was debunked kind of that that is the

3196.92 --> 3201.9300000000003
entire thing that's happening so this

3199.13 --> 3204.599
just pointless it's pointless to then

3201.93 --> 3208.5589999999997
first debunk it and then use that

3204.599 --> 3211.65
debunked thing for your argument why

3208.559 --> 3218.1600000000003
it's not flat it's preposterous

3211.65 --> 3221.0
Daniel it's preposterous things are

3218.16 --> 3224.569
confirmed flat measurably flat and

3221.0 --> 3227.45
definitely flat enough it's not the

3224.569 --> 3230.13
slight micro wobbly Ness

3227.45 --> 3232.2889999999998
over that overall on average flat

3230.13 --> 3234.4500000000003
surface that is gonna cause that

3232.289 --> 3242.369
obstruction the way it does in that

3234.45 --> 3245.6699999999996
specific way that just no it's as good

3242.369 --> 3247.6800000000003
as flat like water if you would be

3245.67 --> 3250.92
looking over water in the open ocean

3247.68 --> 3255.39
there was no tide going on it would be

3250.92 --> 3257.5190000000002
yeah a bit wobbly but yeah the space in

3255.39 --> 3258.96
between the up and the down part of the

3257.519 --> 3263.9599999999996
waves it's going to be pretty average

3258.96 --> 3263.96
and flat

3266.319 --> 3271.979
so it is not the total cause of all the

3269.109 --> 3274.38
obstruction it is not the cause of the

3271.979 --> 3276.4289999999996
consume and effect that happens

3274.38 --> 3278.529
naturally when you look over flat

3276.429 --> 3281.559
surfaces at a certain proximity to that

3278.529 --> 3284.799
flat surface it just manifests and we

3281.559 --> 3294.8390000000004
don't understand or I don't fully

3284.799 --> 3298.569
understand what causes all that no no

3294.839 --> 3301.8089999999997
it's ridiculous Daniel that floor is not

3298.569 --> 3304.929
that freakin wobbly right

3301.809 --> 3306.9990000000003
yeah those floors are made for strollers

3304.929 --> 3312.539
and everything it's not gonna be a

3306.999 --> 3312.5389999999998
centimeter wobble that's ridiculous you

3313.349 --> 3324.13
have no proof that it is wobbly like

3316.209 --> 3326.499
that at all yet not a sentiment do you

3324.13 --> 3329.949
know how much a centimeter wobble in the

3326.499 --> 3332.229
floor actually matters right if you have

3329.949 --> 3335.949
that kind of irregularity there would

3332.229 --> 3338.4089999999997
either be a bump somewhere for for the

3335.949 --> 3340.839
stroller car thingies their wheels or

3338.409 --> 3342.789
you would like put your car there and

3340.839 --> 3344.769
then Sully would start rolling away

3342.789 --> 3347.0690000000004
that's what happens when the floor is so

3344.769 --> 3352.299
irregular that there's like centimeter

3347.069 --> 3354.669
deviations absurd those floors are not

3352.299 --> 3357.309
like that they're pretty damn flat and

3354.669 --> 3360.249
any kind of deviation it's not going to

3357.309 --> 3360.909
be a freakin centimeter height it's

3360.249 --> 3363.249
never

3360.909 --> 3366.549
that's ridiculous it will be a failed

3363.249 --> 3370.2389999999996
construction if that were the case it's

3366.549 --> 3373.469
ridiculous can't be seriously

3370.239 --> 3373.469
entertaining that thought

3374.99 --> 3380.1299999999997
anyway I'm kind of round out to show a

3378.27 --> 3382.17
flat earth debates are starting and

3380.13 --> 3387.089
getting kind of tired out of

3382.17 --> 3391.23
entertaining this ball nonsense the

3387.089 --> 3393.18
well-known ball arguments supposedly so

3391.23 --> 3396.119
yeah I'm gonna run out to show thanks

3393.18 --> 3398.04
everyone for coming it's been pretty

3396.119 --> 3402.51
interesting hanging out lots of Flat

3398.04 --> 3407.16
Earth related subjects somebody had me

3402.51 --> 3409.65
on skype for a fishing pirate he wants

3407.16 --> 3413.67
to join some time but can't today oh

3409.65 --> 3416.9700000000003
well anyway yeah if you liked the video

3413.67 --> 3418.319
please don't forget to upload it and if

3416.97 --> 3419.8489999999997
you haven't already subscribe to my

3418.319 --> 3421.109
channel hit the bell notification so you

3419.849 --> 3423.44
know when I'm going live which is

3421.109 --> 3426.2599999999998
normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time every day

3423.44 --> 3429.599
also please support my efforts

3426.26 --> 3435.2000000000003
preferably through PayPal and the other

3429.599 --> 3438.329
projects like my patreon and my GoFundMe

3435.2 --> 3441.66
yeah do help me out there if you can if

3438.329 --> 3443.1600000000003
you haven't already and I will be back

3441.66 --> 3447.54
tomorrow with Flat Earth

3443.16 --> 3451.23
early-bird number 198 we're getting very

3447.54 --> 3456.119
close the 200 mark can't believe already

3451.23 --> 3457.5
getting there so yeah I'm gonna join the

3456.119 --> 3459.78
Flat Earth debates right after this

3457.5 --> 3460.95
there's still room in the panel until

3459.78 --> 3467.7000000000003
the next Flat Earth

3460.95 --> 3469.6899999999996
early-bird keep it flat and have a nice

3467.7 --> 3503.31
day

3469.69 --> 3503.31
