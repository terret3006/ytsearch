it'll be much appreciated right

68.799 --> 75.84
so yeah over half an hour late

73.68 --> 76.88000000000001
it's not my fault this time because

75.84 --> 78.799
youtube

76.88 --> 80.79899999999999
five minutes before it was gonna start

78.799 --> 81.119
at the show just went completely down

80.799 --> 84.4
and

81.119 --> 85.6
other things too like gmail so i just

84.4 --> 88.799
couldn't

85.6 --> 90.96
do i just had to wait right but it's

88.799 --> 95.04
back up

90.96 --> 96.39999999999999
and yeah i think i'll have to share the

95.04 --> 98.159
show because there's probably a lot of

96.4 --> 102.88000000000001
people

98.159 --> 102.88000000000001
that don't realize it's back up

103.46 --> 107.6
[Music]

110.56 --> 117.2
right so let's hope people soon

114.0 --> 120.719
figure it out some weird issues

117.2 --> 122.88
like with obs too i had to reset

120.719 --> 124.719
the streaming key because the first time

122.88 --> 126.079
i went live five minutes ago it just

124.719 --> 129.039
didn't do anything

126.079 --> 130.399
and just didn't respond so hey there's

129.039 --> 133.51999999999998
the first person here

130.399 --> 133.52
sucker punch hello

135.599 --> 138.79999999999998
all right so it's monday

140.64 --> 147.92
the 14th of december 2020

144.64 --> 147.92
i got green tea with me

148.48 --> 154.84
and right

152.239 --> 156.8
weather's again very different from

154.84 --> 158.4
yesterday

156.8 --> 159.84
although yeah this morning there was

158.4 --> 162.959
actually kind of nice

159.84 --> 165.04
clear sun and stuff now it's a little

162.959 --> 168.31900000000002
bit more cloudy

165.04 --> 171.04
also been noticing like planes

168.319 --> 173.92
leaving behind trails yesterday mostly

171.04 --> 177.04
and this morning too

173.92 --> 178.879
and then like yeah this happened so i

177.04 --> 181.35999999999999
wonder like

178.879 --> 182.56
didn't really seem like chemtrails or

181.36 --> 184.87900000000002
anything

182.56 --> 186.56
but are they adding to just basic

184.879 --> 188.56
weather modification making it a little

186.56 --> 190.319
bit more cloudy for some reason i don't

188.56 --> 193.84
know

190.319 --> 195.76
but it does typically tend to change the

193.84 --> 198.8
weather though

195.76 --> 202.0
whenever i see that anyway yeah no

198.8 --> 202.0
no real sun right now

205.76 --> 209.51899999999998
oh yeah a little bit clouds are kind of

209.04 --> 212.4
moving

209.519 --> 213.36
up up there visibly i don't know if you

212.4 --> 217.84
can pick it up

213.36 --> 217.84
me moving around the camera constantly

223.04 --> 227.84
all right

229.04 --> 235.67999999999998
right anyway hello

232.239 --> 239.76
so samson's here tiny wumbo

235.68 --> 243.20000000000002
[ __ ] wassel george sanford

239.76 --> 244.879
good to see you indeed youtube and gmail

243.2 --> 248.23899999999998
were down

244.879 --> 250.39999999999998
a d life i checked elife just in case it

248.239 --> 252.72
was still there but it had some issues

250.4 --> 255.68
as well with uploading streams so it

252.72 --> 259.199
said so something was going down

255.68 --> 259.199
and it took about half an hour

261.199 --> 268.16
like maybe some part broke and they had

264.56 --> 271.36
to just quickly fix it

268.16 --> 274.639
it can happen especially if you have a

271.36 --> 276.08000000000004
massive massive amount of computers

274.639 --> 278.639
basically

276.08 --> 278.639
being it

279.28 --> 283.11999999999995
i'm sure they have very efficient

281.68 --> 286.24
programs to quickly

283.12 --> 288.72
figure out what's wrong

286.24 --> 290.24
compared to if they had to like manually

288.72 --> 293.28000000000003
figure it out

290.24 --> 293.68
but yeah can still take a while so i get

293.28 --> 296.88
it

293.68 --> 298.639
half an hour is pretty quick i think i i

296.88 --> 300.56
was thinking like oh damn it today

298.639 --> 303.919
there's not going to be any youtube

300.56 --> 305.28000000000003
what a bummer but yeah only half an hour

303.919 --> 307.75899999999996
so anyway

305.28 --> 307.75899999999996
we're back

308.72 --> 311.84000000000003
how are you all doing

313.12 --> 318.56
yesterday it's a pretty good day

319.12 --> 324.08
and i watched some videos again like i

322.24 --> 326.88
started watching babylon 5

324.08 --> 328.479
back again it was very weird to seeing

326.88 --> 332.24
it back

328.479 --> 333.68
and like how different that series

332.24 --> 335.919
really is

333.68 --> 336.88
and in it's funny because my memory kind

335.919 --> 340.4
of like

336.88 --> 343.36
glorifies some bits but also

340.4 --> 346.08
underestimates other bits it's quite

343.36 --> 346.08000000000004
fascinating

347.44 --> 351.6
and also watching it back like this is

349.919 --> 353.12
the first time i'm watching it since

351.6 --> 354.08000000000004
figuring out flat earth you gotta

353.12 --> 357.199
realize that i've

354.08 --> 362.31899999999996
watched it last fully

357.199 --> 362.319
in like two thousand

363.28 --> 369.35999999999996
eleven i think no wait yeah 2011

370.16 --> 372.88000000000005
roughly then

374.319 --> 379.6
right a fletcher fe good to see you

377.68 --> 381.84000000000003
but yeah watching some of it back it's

379.6 --> 382.72
pretty intense also i had to be careful

381.84 --> 386.08
because yeah

382.72 --> 389.12
i as i said with here we go again

386.08 --> 391.75899999999996
who's become a great fan of the series

389.12 --> 392.479
like watching it and yeah she totally

391.759 --> 395.91900000000004
digs it and

392.479 --> 397.68
yeah i dig it too

395.919 --> 398.96
it's it's just nice to see somebody

397.68 --> 404.08
getting into that

398.96 --> 404.08
for the first time and

404.4 --> 407.52
yeah i'm just gradually starting to

406.319 --> 410.24
watch it back myself

407.52 --> 411.19899999999996
except yeah in the past you know i've

410.24 --> 413.039
i've been what

411.199 --> 415.12
like there's this weird thing about it

413.039 --> 417.36
because in the past i had moments of

415.12 --> 421.52
periods where i felt really bad

417.36 --> 421.52000000000004
and would just escape in anything right

421.68 --> 427.599
just did not really just to take my mind

425.039 --> 428.71999999999997
off things that i felt very

427.599 --> 430.71999999999997
uncomfortable about

428.72 --> 432.8
like things that i learned on alex jones

430.72 --> 435.759
or something

432.8 --> 437.36
but yeah when i escaped into it like

435.759 --> 438.08000000000004
it's very weird because there's some

437.36 --> 441.759
really

438.08 --> 444.08
creepy like mystical

441.759 --> 445.12
dark stuff in there as well and it's

444.08 --> 448.08
like very

445.12 --> 450.56
biblical in nature how it put in there

448.08 --> 452.24
also i like how they're just

450.56 --> 454.08
like some of these characters are like

452.24 --> 456.16
openly christian

454.08 --> 458.4
and all that don't see that anymore

456.16 --> 460.96000000000004
these days like without them just

458.4 --> 463.039
being absolutely ridiculed so it's

460.96 --> 465.919
actually kind of respectful

463.039 --> 466.639
it's unusual to realize that then like

465.919 --> 470.15999999999997
hey

466.639 --> 473.36
wow they're actually like common sense

470.16 --> 475.68
christian anyway that's that's new no

473.36 --> 478.72
that's actually old

475.68 --> 480.34000000000003
right uh

478.72 --> 482.16
like

480.34 --> 484.63899999999995
[Music]

482.16 --> 485.199
but yeah i had some pretty weird moments

484.639 --> 488.479
back

485.199 --> 489.52000000000004
back in the day watching it and that

488.479 --> 492.4
when i felt bad

489.52 --> 494.479
and then watched it to escape then it

492.4 --> 494.96
would kind of creep the darkness would

494.479 --> 497.35999999999996
creep

494.96 --> 499.84
up from in the series and i would then

497.36 --> 499.84000000000003
instead

500.639 --> 504.96000000000004
yeah because there's some pretty freaky

503.759 --> 508.96000000000004
mysteries

504.96 --> 510.0
in that series like and they really

508.96 --> 512.3199999999999
build upon it

510.0 --> 513.279
it's not like spooky and then you never

512.32 --> 516.9590000000001
hear of it again no

513.279 --> 520.32
no no like everything is very

516.959 --> 522.3199999999999
thought out like in retrospect

520.32 --> 524.1590000000001
when you've watched the entire thing you

522.32 --> 526.399
you're you'll probably come to the

524.159 --> 528.16
conclusion that the entire series

526.399 --> 529.92
was kind of planned out before they

528.16 --> 532.24
started it

529.92 --> 533.279
and it's just that the acting was

532.24 --> 537.12
probably

533.279 --> 539.4399999999999
they just had to try and make it into a

537.12 --> 541.36
visual thing but the plan the whole

539.44 --> 542.6400000000001
story was probably already kind of

541.36 --> 544.8000000000001
structured

542.64 --> 546.8
well thought out in advance and there's

544.8 --> 549.4399999999999
like time elements to that

546.8 --> 552.6189999999999
prophecy elements to it

549.44 --> 552.619
[Music]

555.279 --> 560.16
right anyway

560.56 --> 563.92
star trek next generation you talk about

563.68 --> 566.0
it

563.92 --> 567.279
never watch babylon 5. yeah star trek

566.0 --> 570.72
next generation is

567.279 --> 573.6
is kind of interesting too it's still

570.72 --> 576.399
star trek though

573.6 --> 576.88
there's just some it's an interesting

576.399 --> 578.88
setting

576.88 --> 580.56
what they've done they they really like

578.88 --> 582.16
star trek next generation like really

580.56 --> 584.399
try to

582.16 --> 585.8389999999999
bring the yeah the next generation like

584.399 --> 590.88
build the next step

585.839 --> 593.6
beyond the original star trek

590.88 --> 595.519
how that was done with a lot of stage

593.6 --> 597.44
works and they kind of like really

595.519 --> 600.72
upgraded the stage works

597.44 --> 602.32
in star trek next generation gave it

600.72 --> 605.9200000000001
more

602.32 --> 607.6800000000001
more depth to everything

605.92 --> 609.04
more character depth to character

607.68 --> 612.88
development

609.04 --> 614.959
much more pronounced in that series

612.88 --> 616.56
but yeah babylon 5 is just completely

614.959 --> 620.88
different because it's

616.56 --> 620.88
not formulaic in a

621.04 --> 625.04
episode to episode basis like star trek

623.68 --> 627.3599999999999
clearly is

625.04 --> 629.1999999999999
there are some lines in it development

627.36 --> 632.0790000000001
lines but it's just

629.2 --> 634.0
designed to be as an episode by episode

632.079 --> 637.1999999999999
kind of series and babylon 5

634.0 --> 640.32
is just one big story

637.2 --> 643.44
all of it it's like it like a dnd

640.32 --> 645.2
game in the sci-fi babylon 5 setting

643.44 --> 647.36
and it's just the characters they just

645.2 --> 651.839
developed from the start they all have

647.36 --> 654.48
some history and it's expanded upon

651.839 --> 654.48
it's yeah

655.6 --> 663.519
anyway okay ryan eartherton

659.12 --> 666.16
jamie bruce used to get lost in voyager

663.519 --> 666.16
yeah yeah

668.24 --> 674.9590000000001
yeah voyager is like even more

671.92 --> 676.56
voyager went more into story development

674.959 --> 680.8
and really tried to like

676.56 --> 684.2399999999999
get more technical

680.8 --> 686.24
clarity on technological developments

684.24 --> 689.839
which were still a complete mess in star

686.24 --> 689.839
trek next generation

691.68 --> 696.399
and practically illusory and star in the

694.64 --> 703.8389999999999
original series it's just like oh

696.399 --> 703.839
technology we have things

714.839 --> 717.839
hmm

724.8 --> 733.8389999999999
if ai hits defend it'll all be over

730.8 --> 733.8389999999999
it's weird because

735.68 --> 741.279
i think they're they're yeah i feel i

737.76 --> 743.4399999999999
have a philosophical approach

741.279 --> 745.36
on the whole ai thing i've explained

743.44 --> 749.44
some of it because i think that

745.36 --> 749.44
because of the inherent design

749.92 --> 754.7199999999999
designated by the creator even of how

753.519 --> 758.079
the spirit is

754.72 --> 759.2
the spirit of humans like an ai would

758.079 --> 761.68
sort of be like an

759.2 --> 762.9590000000001
electronic spirit once it is becomes

761.68 --> 766.6389999999999
like self

762.959 --> 768.88
cycled self maintained all that

766.639 --> 771.36
but then just the same applies as with

768.88 --> 774.639
humans

771.36 --> 778.48
the human spirits like become

774.639 --> 780.399
unnatural then they start to degenerate

778.48 --> 783.44
and i think that the ai

780.399 --> 786.399
would do the same so that the only ai

783.44 --> 788.9590000000001
that could actually be

786.399 --> 790.639
survive that could like not

788.959 --> 793.4399999999999
self-destruct

790.639 --> 794.72
would be the one that is like balanced

793.44 --> 797.7600000000001
like a human would be

794.72 --> 801.0400000000001
in its characteristics but

797.76 --> 801.36
hey maybe that's my idea about it it's

801.04 --> 803.92
just

801.36 --> 805.36
it that makes sense to me if that were

803.92 --> 808.3199999999999
the case

805.36 --> 810.32
like if it's not properly balanced in

808.32 --> 812.5600000000001
its character as a human being with all

810.32 --> 816.0
the complexities that comes with it

812.56 --> 819.8389999999999
and it'll just be only efficiency then

816.0 --> 819.839
it's just going to self-destruct

825.36 --> 829.6
that's my idea about it that's why i'm

827.279 --> 830.88
very skeptical about the whole doom of

829.6 --> 834.16
the ai

830.88 --> 836.959
because it's yeah if it's not as

834.16 --> 839.36
a human with everything that comes with

836.959 --> 839.3599999999999
it then

839.839 --> 846.48
yeah what's it gonna do like

843.36 --> 846.48
like it's a computer

855.44 --> 858.72
ghost in the machine yeah about time

858.24 --> 861.6800000000001
cool

858.72 --> 863.6
comes back online yeah yeah it's about

861.68 --> 871.5999999999999
times to only half an hour

863.6 --> 873.519
it's barely barely offline

871.6 --> 875.0400000000001
even though it was poorly timed because

873.519 --> 876.24
it was right when my show was going to

875.04 --> 878.7199999999999
start

876.24 --> 878.72
oh well

879.6 --> 882.9590000000001
anyway yeah good to see you guys and

882.0 --> 885.839
gals all hey

882.959 --> 885.8389999999999
robin stanley

886.88 --> 891.36
so yeah i've been watching some babylon

888.88 --> 894.56
5 also been watching south park again

891.36 --> 899.839
starting at season 3.

894.56 --> 899.8389999999999
damn bro that series is so intense

900.079 --> 903.3199999999999
and watching it back now it was much

902.16 --> 906.079
more

903.32 --> 907.279
straightforward and just unapologetic

906.079 --> 913.8389999999999
even at the beginning

907.279 --> 913.8389999999999
few seasons

918.24 --> 922.88
huh so i've been kind of mixing it up a

920.56 --> 926.3199999999999
little south park in little babylon five

922.88 --> 929.04
a couple of games didn't really watch a

926.32 --> 929.0400000000001
lot of streams

938.72 --> 941.839
all right yeah

942.079 --> 948.6389999999999
all right gmail's also back up let's see

945.36 --> 948.639
let's check out d live

949.68 --> 953.279
ah d live is still experiencing

951.839 --> 957.36
technical issues with

953.279 --> 960.88
live streams might not load right

957.36 --> 960.88
hmm weird

964.72 --> 969.839
oh all right see you later todd wuzzle

974.0 --> 978.639
going to the moon oh well

977.04 --> 980.88
sucker punch if it's all going to the

978.639 --> 997.839
moon that literally means it's going

980.88 --> 997.8389999999999
nowhere so i wouldn't be too worried

1008.839 --> 1011.839
hmm

1017.759 --> 1020.0790000000001
right

1021.6 --> 1025.199
apparently there was a busters yesterday

1024.0 --> 1028.24
i didn't watch it

1025.199 --> 1031.679
adam seems to have watched it

1028.24 --> 1034.559
when he says and i

1031.679 --> 1036.48
definitely trust his judgment so is very

1034.559 --> 1038.48
reliable

1036.48 --> 1039.52
says that they basically didn't get john

1038.48 --> 1042.959
d's point and

1039.52 --> 1046.6399999999999
try to make it their own

1042.959 --> 1050.24
they addressed the energy thing

1046.64 --> 1054.64
the energy discussion that john d

1050.24 --> 1054.64
has been bringing to the to his channel

1054.799 --> 1059.2
so yeah of course lots of confusion

1058.48 --> 1062.72
everywhere

1059.2 --> 1064.88
to be expected i still have not watched

1062.72 --> 1067.3600000000001
it by the way i'm sorry i didn't get to

1064.88 --> 1070.24
it should probably should have it just

1067.36 --> 1070.24
didn't feel like it

1071.2 --> 1077.52
getting 503 error i got a 500 error

1078.84 --> 1081.84
right

1083.28 --> 1086.559
anyway it's back up you're watching me

1085.36 --> 1089.039
right now you are

1086.559 --> 1091.44
typing in chat so but things are back to

1089.039 --> 1091.44
normal

1092.4 --> 1100.64
little dot check nope

1095.52 --> 1100.6399999999999
still no check channel function great

1106.84 --> 1109.84
thanks

1110.14 --> 1113.199
[Music]

1113.2 --> 1116.96
i still i still think it's just

1115.2 --> 1120.16
ridiculous you know

1116.96 --> 1123.2
it should like let the channel owner

1120.16 --> 1125.679
at least have the function

1123.2 --> 1128.0800000000002
to be able to check channel in their own

1125.679 --> 1128.72
chat come on youtube come on it makes no

1128.08 --> 1130.559
sense

1128.72 --> 1131.919
you don't want people stalking others

1130.559 --> 1135.76
bullying others

1131.919 --> 1138.4
i get it if that was even the intent

1135.76 --> 1138.96
behind taking it away right but let the

1138.4 --> 1142.0
freaking

1138.96 --> 1145.76
channel owner be able to do it at least

1142.0 --> 1150.96
you know if it's their channel

1145.76 --> 1154.08
crying out loud and then people

1150.96 --> 1157.679
know that and if they then don't if they

1154.08 --> 1159.9189999999999
want to stay anonymous or something

1157.679 --> 1162.3200000000002
then they don't go to a channel of

1159.919 --> 1166.72
people they don't trust

1162.32 --> 1168.559
come on it's just so inconvenient

1166.72 --> 1171.1200000000001
because you can't double check

1168.559 --> 1172.0
in this case if a person is actually the

1171.12 --> 1174.0
real person

1172.0 --> 1177.28
or a soccer count troll trying to

1174.0 --> 1180.24
pretend to be that person in order to

1177.28 --> 1180.72
create a ruckus between individuals you

1180.24 --> 1184.4
know

1180.72 --> 1187.84
it's too easy to do that now

1184.4 --> 1188.3200000000002
give us back the function to avoid these

1187.84 --> 1191.039
kind of

1188.32 --> 1193.039
potential catastrophes that can happen

1191.039 --> 1196.72
in communities on youtube

1193.039 --> 1196.72
because you took the function away

1197.52 --> 1207.84
come on youtube

1209.44 --> 1217.92
[Music]

1220.48 --> 1223.28
still lots of trolls and flowers

1221.84 --> 1224.08
hangouts of course they're still in

1223.28 --> 1226.1589999999999
there

1224.08 --> 1227.1999999999998
they can't handle it they have to come

1226.159 --> 1230.24
back every day

1227.2 --> 1231.8400000000001
to tell them that we are a waste of time

1230.24 --> 1233.28
and then we're wrong about everything

1231.84 --> 1235.4399999999998
and that

1233.28 --> 1236.799
it's so ridiculous that we're doing that

1235.44 --> 1240.559
even though they come back

1236.799 --> 1243.84
every single day to basically

1240.559 --> 1248.8799999999999
proclaim all that which is

1243.84 --> 1250.8799999999999
kind of an act of delusional desperation

1248.88 --> 1252.5590000000002
because why would you if that's really

1250.88 --> 1254.159
true then why would you come back every

1252.559 --> 1257.52
day to say that

1254.159 --> 1260.4
are you afraid

1257.52 --> 1260.8799999999999
that it's actually [ __ ] what you're

1260.4 --> 1264.3200000000002
saying

1260.88 --> 1266.5590000000002
that it's actually the other way around

1264.32 --> 1267.9189999999999
and you just can't handle it because if

1266.559 --> 1270.48
you were right

1267.919 --> 1271.3600000000001
naturally right with what you proclaimed

1270.48 --> 1274.88
about that

1271.36 --> 1277.84
you would not be coming back every day

1274.88 --> 1277.8400000000001
makes no sense

1278.159 --> 1281.7600000000002
it literally makes no sense

1282.559 --> 1287.6789999999999
like if it was just some nonsense story

1285.76 --> 1289.919
out there

1287.679 --> 1291.2
the flat earth right it's all nonsense

1289.919 --> 1293.1200000000001
then

1291.2 --> 1294.4
why would you care there's a lot of

1293.12 --> 1297.36
people out there that

1294.4 --> 1298.64
are upholding their own little nonsense

1297.36 --> 1300.08
story

1298.64 --> 1301.679
you know and really believing it

1300.08 --> 1304.1589999999999
literally there's people out there that

1301.679 --> 1305.44
literally believe they communicate with

1304.159 --> 1308.7990000000002
aliens

1305.44 --> 1311.6000000000001
through portals on a daily basis like

1308.799 --> 1312.559
literally they've basically gone from

1311.6 --> 1314.3999999999999
like this

1312.559 --> 1315.9189999999999
communicating with spirits type of

1314.4 --> 1318.72
insight to they are

1315.919 --> 1320.0800000000002
aliens right i've known people like that

1318.72 --> 1322.72
for

1320.08 --> 1324.799
or known i've met people like that like

1322.72 --> 1326.4
even a decade ago that that's around

1324.799 --> 1326.8799999999999
there's a whole bunch of people like

1326.4 --> 1330.159
that

1326.88 --> 1333.2
do you go to their channels tell them oh

1330.159 --> 1336.88
you're wrong you're delusional

1333.2 --> 1339.28
no who gives a [ __ ] right because it's

1336.88 --> 1341.919
kind of obvious so why would you come

1339.28 --> 1344.48
back every freaking day

1341.919 --> 1346.5590000000002
to a flat earth channel to tell them

1344.48 --> 1349.28
it's all [ __ ] oh

1346.559 --> 1351.2
it's it's all nonsense why do you do it

1349.28 --> 1353.6
you're just making a fool of yourself

1351.2 --> 1355.919
[Music]

1353.6 --> 1355.9189999999999
right

1356.96 --> 1362.24
i'm not feeding the trolls

1360.08 --> 1364.08
paid trolls you say really who's paying

1362.24 --> 1365.679
them

1364.08 --> 1368.48
i don't think so i think they're being

1365.679 --> 1370.4
paid by their own spirit

1368.48 --> 1373.039
i think they're just compulsive they

1370.4 --> 1375.039
just can't deal with the lies

1373.039 --> 1376.48
so they have to project what they want

1375.039 --> 1380.08
to be the truth

1376.48 --> 1380.08
onto the thing that hurts them

1383.36 --> 1386.6399999999999
but they don't realize it

1387.6 --> 1395.12
ego indeed trolls feed themselves you're

1391.2 --> 1395.1200000000001
right they eat on their own excrement

1401.6 --> 1405.52
they constantly out [ __ ] and they buy

1403.919 --> 1409.2800000000002
the [ __ ] they spew out

1405.52 --> 1409.28
themselves they start to believe it

1410.0 --> 1416.32
because that's really what they want

1412.799 --> 1420.32
they just want to forget about the nasty

1416.32 --> 1423.039
mean questions that

1420.32 --> 1425.279
tries to basically force the mind to

1423.039 --> 1425.52
actually look at things as they really

1425.279 --> 1428.32
are

1425.52 --> 1430.799
and cross-referencing them with

1428.32 --> 1432.799
fundamental physics

1430.799 --> 1434.8799999999999
knowledge things that we've learned that

1432.799 --> 1435.9189999999999
we know natural all that and they don't

1434.88 --> 1438.96
want to know

1435.919 --> 1439.3600000000001
they don't want it they want zaval they

1438.96 --> 1442.8400000000001
want

1439.36 --> 1444.0
the fantasy they want to think that

1442.84 --> 1446.799
maybe

1444.0 --> 1448.0
somebody's in their family or a friend

1446.799 --> 1450.08
or maybe themselves

1448.0 --> 1451.52
will actually be one of these

1450.08 --> 1455.84
fantastical

1451.52 --> 1455.84
people having space adventures

1456.08 --> 1461.12
and that there's hope for infinite

1458.48 --> 1464.799
resources out there

1461.12 --> 1466.8799999999999
entire asteroids made out of gold

1464.799 --> 1467.84
or something you know that's what they

1466.88 --> 1472.0800000000002
want

1467.84 --> 1475.12
they want that that extremity fantasy to

1472.08 --> 1476.799
be literal they want to be able to

1475.12 --> 1479.76
escape in that and have

1476.799 --> 1479.76
a feeling of

1479.84 --> 1482.8799999999999
fake security

1483.44 --> 1490.0800000000002
and yeah infinite plenty

1487.44 --> 1490.559
the potential for that and an adventure

1490.08 --> 1493.039
to

1490.559 --> 1494.3999999999999
attain it right that's what they want

1493.039 --> 1497.919
that's the formula

1494.4 --> 1499.8400000000001
that's what keeps drawing them in

1497.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
and they can't handle when somebody

1499.84 --> 1505.1999999999998
points out that yeah that's just

1501.84 --> 1505.1999999999998
absolutely impossible

1506.08 --> 1513.039
you you should probably try to attain

1510.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
something as fulfilling like that from

1513.039 --> 1515.84
another angle

1515.919 --> 1519.8400000000001
because there is plenty i'm pretty sure

1518.24 --> 1521.36
there is plenty right here on the earth

1519.84 --> 1524.1589999999999
and what the earth is

1521.36 --> 1526.32
we don't even know really how much of it

1524.159 --> 1529.44
there really is

1526.32 --> 1533.039
how it works why

1529.44 --> 1536.64
right so there is still plenty

1533.039 --> 1541.6
pretty sure of that it's just not

1536.64 --> 1543.6000000000001
nonsense infinity level of plenty

1541.6 --> 1545.76
you're never you're never gonna walk on

1543.6 --> 1548.24
an asteroid made of gold

1545.76 --> 1556.4
you know you gotta let that one go

1548.24 --> 1560.159
that's just nonsense

1556.4 --> 1563.6000000000001
yeah draining diamonds on exoplanets

1560.159 --> 1565.8400000000001
yeah that's kind of silly and it's also

1563.6 --> 1568.799
pointless because diamonds can be

1565.84 --> 1571.1999999999998
artificially made

1568.799 --> 1573.12
they're not really that precious it's

1571.2 --> 1574.0800000000002
just kind of difficult to cut them right

1573.12 --> 1585.84
that's really

1574.08 --> 1585.84
the craft is the precious part

1592.88 --> 1599.6000000000001
all right so yeah trolls

1596.88 --> 1601.919
they are there they will be there for a

1599.6 --> 1601.9189999999999
while

1606.24 --> 1613.84
bean should have been a daily thing what

1614.64 --> 1617.679
now they give us animation stuff from

1616.88 --> 1619.8400000000001
china

1617.679 --> 1622.799
come on now but what they're doing it's

1619.84 --> 1626.559
basically a judicial trick

1622.799 --> 1629.12
you see the animation things because

1626.559 --> 1630.24
they will give you the representation of

1629.12 --> 1634.0
what's happening

1630.24 --> 1636.64
in the spot and just try to make it

1634.0 --> 1638.399
enough so you can go with it and enjoy

1636.64 --> 1641.1200000000001
the idea of it

1638.399 --> 1641.9189999999999
but so that they don't have to basically

1641.12 --> 1643.6789999999999
justify

1641.919 --> 1645.44
anything about it because they claimed

1643.679 --> 1648.5590000000002
it was literally real

1645.44 --> 1649.1200000000001
you see so it's actually a judicial

1648.559 --> 1651.039
thing

1649.12 --> 1653.1999999999998
why they now use all these animations

1651.039 --> 1656.1589999999999
instead of actually trying to

1653.2 --> 1657.919
supposedly catch it on camera because

1656.159 --> 1660.24
the judicial implications

1657.919 --> 1661.279
if you claim it is literally real and

1660.24 --> 1665.2
all there

1661.279 --> 1667.679
it's problematic because it isn't real

1665.2 --> 1669.76
if you just show an animation instead

1667.679 --> 1672.72
you can easily bypass that by saying no

1669.76 --> 1674.48
no it's just a representation

1672.72 --> 1676.0
it looks so fake it's cinnamon yeah

1674.48 --> 1678.799
because it is

1676.0 --> 1679.52
oh you didn't know that well should have

1678.799 --> 1682.32
looked in

1679.52 --> 1683.44
corner it's like a visual an animated

1682.32 --> 1685.279
representation

1683.44 --> 1687.2
it was in small letters right there in

1685.279 --> 1691.52
the corner right

1687.2 --> 1697.8400000000001
that sort of thing it's just a trick

1691.52 --> 1697.84
to make it a little easier

1700.48 --> 1705.76
what were your thoughts on the ball

1702.0 --> 1705.76
buster episode yes i didn't watch it

1708.84 --> 1711.84
sorry

1714.32 --> 1720.0
kiwi wasn't happy and had an outburst

1716.48 --> 1724.559
transfer calling out bob in the bulbus

1720.0 --> 1728.159
globe busters

1724.559 --> 1729.84
probably why would you

1728.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
call out why would he call it the ball

1729.84 --> 1739.84
busters gang what

1740.88 --> 1748.0800000000002
right thought so yeah

1746.0 --> 1749.44
well john's basically

1748.08 --> 1752.559
[Music]

1749.44 --> 1753.44
conv shared with us after i inquired

1752.559 --> 1756.96
that he

1753.44 --> 1758.0
just he doesn't give a [ __ ] for social

1756.96 --> 1761.2
etiquette

1758.0 --> 1763.44
or social maneuvering in the scene

1761.2 --> 1765.52
he's just doing what he's always done he

1763.44 --> 1769.039
doesn't give a [ __ ] about this

1765.52 --> 1772.96
this friend politics situation and he's

1769.039 --> 1772.96
just doing exactly what he always does

1774.159 --> 1778.159
just going after people when they talk

1776.08 --> 1779.36
nonsense even if they continue to talk

1778.159 --> 1782.24
that nonsense

1779.36 --> 1784.24
for months on end you know not saying

1782.24 --> 1787.279
that is the specific case here but

1784.24 --> 1790.3990000000001
john is just he doesn't give a [ __ ]

1787.279 --> 1791.52
he literally doesn't like he he can't be

1790.399 --> 1793.84
bothered

1791.52 --> 1795.679
and it's not even the same he literally

1793.84 --> 1798.72
can't be bothered like

1795.679 --> 1802.5590000000002
he can't be made to care he just it

1798.72 --> 1802.559
he hates that nonsense

1803.52 --> 1808.08
and he just doesn't give a [ __ ] so he's

1805.279 --> 1810.0
just gonna go after the technicals

1808.08 --> 1812.399
and that's just how john is i totally

1810.0 --> 1812.399
get that

1816.159 --> 1820.96
does it mean that john's right all the

1818.64 --> 1820.96
time

1821.52 --> 1828.48
he's a human being

1825.279 --> 1830.72
but his strategy is just no-nonsense

1828.48 --> 1834.96
technical criticism

1830.72 --> 1836.78
and he will blow up as he pleases

1834.96 --> 1839.9
as you all know

1836.78 --> 1839.8999999999999
[Music]

1840.0 --> 1843.679
oh dear discussion

1846.24 --> 1851.84
let's mute the [ __ ] out of that

1853.84 --> 1860.6399999999999
if that's possible yeah if you put

1857.279 --> 1861.6
on away or do not disturb then you don't

1860.64 --> 1865.3600000000001
hear the boop

1861.6 --> 1868.3999999999999
bloop stupid pop-up sounds

1865.36 --> 1868.3999999999999
[Music]

1868.559 --> 1873.2
hey oh damn it you still hear it oh

1872.399 --> 1879.84
freaking out

1873.2 --> 1879.8400000000001
i'll just log out yeah

1881.2 --> 1886.3990000000001
what do you think of elon musk why do

1883.919 --> 1893.8400000000001
you ask

1886.399 --> 1893.84
what should i be thinking of him

1904.84 --> 1907.84
serious

1909.919 --> 1914.5600000000002
what would you like me to say what

1911.84 --> 1916.799
hasn't been said a million times over

1914.56 --> 1921.84
[Music]

1916.799 --> 1921.84
a legit genius

1922.32 --> 1924.6399999999999
uh

1926.559 --> 1930.72
i don't think he's a legit genius

1931.279 --> 1938.799
but i don't really know

1935.279 --> 1941.039
him that well he might have

1938.799 --> 1941.9189999999999
somehow some ways that he is kind of

1941.039 --> 1944.48
smart

1941.919 --> 1945.279
but he then i guess tends to completely

1944.48 --> 1949.1200000000001
goofball

1945.279 --> 1952.96
it up and lose his higher faculties

1949.12 --> 1956.6399999999999
because i've never really seen him

1952.96 --> 1958.559
really prove it i think it's probably

1956.64 --> 1961.2
easier for him this is

1958.559 --> 1962.6399999999999
an estimate can't make sure really it's

1961.2 --> 1965.6000000000001
probably easier for him to

1962.64 --> 1969.1200000000001
memorize smart things than to actually

1965.6 --> 1971.36
spontaneously conceive them

1969.12 --> 1972.9599999999998
but yeah that's from what i've seen from

1971.36 --> 1973.9189999999999
him so far i don't really think he's

1972.96 --> 1978.72
that smart

1973.919 --> 1982.3200000000002
at all seems more like an actor type

1978.72 --> 1985.6000000000001
and a guy with a lot of money and

1982.32 --> 1988.0
ambitions and

1985.6 --> 1990.24
doesn't really seem to shy away from

1988.0 --> 1992.72
things like that so

1990.24 --> 1993.679
i don't know but i have had a bit of

1992.72 --> 1998.559
trouble just

1993.679 --> 1998.5590000000002
really getting a good read on him

2003.279 --> 2011.2
for example i i don't yeah he does have

2007.6 --> 2013.4399999999998
feelings like he does seem like he is a

2011.2 --> 2016.0
real person and not like

2013.44 --> 2017.679
like a psychopath actor or something i

2016.0 --> 2020.399
didn't get i do get rid of

2017.679 --> 2021.76
actual feelings of him it's just that

2020.399 --> 2023.6789999999999
what is said of him and

2021.76 --> 2024.8799999999999
who he really is that doesn't really

2023.679 --> 2027.279
seem to match

2024.88 --> 2027.279
too much

2030.559 --> 2034.48
i kind of it's kind of the same feeling

2033.76 --> 2037.6
i get

2034.48 --> 2041.1200000000001
with don pettit like he's supposed

2037.6 --> 2044.24
to be this big guy in nasa when

2041.12 --> 2045.279
sorry don you are an absolute [ __ ]

2044.24 --> 2049.359
[ __ ] like

2045.279 --> 2053.44
really dumb so it makes no sense

2049.359 --> 2053.44
in exactly that type of setting

2053.52 --> 2062.96
see but i don't really know

2059.359 --> 2065.44
what yeah who he really is

2062.96 --> 2065.44
too much

2069.359 --> 2076.399
musk is a genetic breed with no soul oh

2072.839 --> 2079.679
sure sure really

2076.399 --> 2082.56
what like can you

2079.679 --> 2084.96
be a little bit more specific seems like

2082.56 --> 2087.52
ridiculous

2084.96 --> 2088.879
genetic breed with no soul that so you

2087.52 --> 2093.359
mean psychopath

2088.879 --> 2096.48
that's cute got any

2093.359 --> 2096.48
actual proof of that

2099.76 --> 2105.76
see i just think that people always draw

2102.88 --> 2105.76
things too far

2113.599 --> 2116.7200000000003
yeah oh really because that's how it

2115.76 --> 2118.48
works right

2116.72 --> 2120.3199999999997
yeah you're a billionaire you just

2118.48 --> 2121.599
started to talk about flat earth of

2120.32 --> 2123.92
course soccer punch

2121.599 --> 2126.6400000000003
you seem to have a really good gauge of

2123.92 --> 2131.839
how this world works

2126.64 --> 2131.839
come on the [ __ ] it's ridiculous

2135.44 --> 2138.48
you should know better than that you

2137.839 --> 2141.7599999999998
can't

2138.48 --> 2145.28
talk about flat earth if you're freaking

2141.76 --> 2149.2000000000003
rich and tied into everything you can't

2145.28 --> 2153.0400000000004
you just can't because the whole thing

2149.2 --> 2156.3199999999997
rests on that heliocentric

2153.04 --> 2158.0
model of origin and all that so they

2156.32 --> 2160.56
just don't do it

2158.0 --> 2162.88
it's not an option in the system as it

2160.56 --> 2162.88
works

2163.04 --> 2167.44
yes build a space program because it's a

2166.16 --> 2169.92
corporate endeavor

2167.44 --> 2171.839
there is interest in people that want to

2169.92 --> 2173.6800000000003
believe in space and want to see rocket

2171.839 --> 2177.52
launches and developments

2173.68 --> 2177.52
so he's just doing it for them

2177.599 --> 2187.839
that's what it is it's like a dream

2181.119 --> 2187.839
factory huh

2188.64 --> 2195.5989999999997
space karen this is right

2192.079 --> 2197.2000000000003
well he has his own agenda he he just

2195.599 --> 2199.92
thinks corona is [ __ ]

2197.2 --> 2203.4399999999996
he does he wants to go against that and

2199.92 --> 2203.44
i actually think that's kind of cool

2206.64 --> 2210.3199999999997
don't beat the devil join him well

2210.4 --> 2215.839
how do you know it's the devil

2219.359 --> 2222.4
the i think you overestimate like how

2221.92 --> 2224.88
much

2222.4 --> 2227.28
these people really know what they get

2224.88 --> 2227.599
themselves into i really think you guys

2227.28 --> 2230.7200000000003
do

2227.599 --> 2230.7200000000003
overestimate that

2232.16 --> 2235.52
most of these people are just ambitious

2234.32 --> 2238.1600000000003
and they just say

2235.52 --> 2239.359
yes a lot when they think they have an

2238.16 --> 2242.3999999999996
opportunity

2239.359 --> 2242.7999999999997
to grow financially or something they

2242.4 --> 2256.4700000000003
just

2242.8 --> 2259.65
say yes they don't think about it

2256.47 --> 2259.6499999999996
[Music]

2261.92 --> 2265.839
right it's easy yeah and he's totally

2264.48 --> 2269.28
right

2265.839 --> 2272.24
it is so yeah there you go

2269.28 --> 2272.88
he spoke the truth about something so

2272.24 --> 2276.4799999999996
yeah he

2272.88 --> 2279.6800000000003
is not a absolute satanist

2276.48 --> 2282.2400000000002
that is just going to be lying with

2279.68 --> 2284.16
everything right he doesn't seem to be a

2282.24 --> 2287.4399999999996
guy like that or he wouldn't have spoken

2284.16 --> 2289.5989999999997
out against the coroner issues

2287.44 --> 2291.2000000000003
so yeah there you go it's become a

2289.599 --> 2292.0
little bit more complicated what do you

2291.2 --> 2296.16
do now

2292.0 --> 2296.16
you just over generalize it all again

2296.56 --> 2303.2
you gotta go with the actions

2300.48 --> 2304.64
and then you gotta make a weighed

2303.2 --> 2313.839
decision on what to

2304.64 --> 2313.839
do with it

2313.92 --> 2317.52
truth among lies and everything

2317.599 --> 2324.1600000000003
well often yes people choose their

2321.2 --> 2327.52
truths and their lies

2324.16 --> 2328.64
but also you got to realize that every

2327.52 --> 2331.68
lie

2328.64 --> 2334.7999999999997
comes with truth

2331.68 --> 2338.3999999999996
because how do you know it's a lie

2334.8 --> 2341.599
unless you know what is true

2338.4 --> 2343.28
see so every lie it comes automatically

2341.599 --> 2347.119
with the truth

2343.28 --> 2350.0
because it's yeah it's diverting from

2347.119 --> 2352.4
it and if it's diverting then that means

2350.0 --> 2355.76
it is there

2352.4 --> 2359.04
and if you learn about it then

2355.76 --> 2369.8390000000004
you figure that out there is no

2359.04 --> 2369.839
lies without truth

2374.64 --> 2385.7599999999998
all right

2382.8 --> 2386.3
heavily controlled i don't know 306 i

2385.76 --> 2389.429
don't know

2386.3 --> 2389.429
[Music]

2391.92 --> 2398.96
i think that a lot of people

2396.8 --> 2400.6400000000003
good people smart people people that

2398.96 --> 2402.16
have figured out that they've been full

2400.64 --> 2402.48
they're trying to figure it out i think

2402.16 --> 2404.64
that

2402.48 --> 2406.88
a lot of people including every one of

2404.64 --> 2410.0
you most of you

2406.88 --> 2413.28
just have a very human tendency to

2410.0 --> 2414.48
dramatically over generalize to make it

2413.28 --> 2417.599
a little bit easier

2414.48 --> 2419.92
to get a grip on the oversight of things

2417.599 --> 2421.04
it dramatically over generalize

2419.92 --> 2423.6800000000003
everybody does it

2421.04 --> 2424.56
most people do it i try to avoid it like

2423.68 --> 2427.52
the plague

2424.56 --> 2429.52
because i tried to look the fractal

2427.52 --> 2433.359
situation of it all

2429.52 --> 2434.8
in every corner like nobody is just one

2433.359 --> 2438.0
singular thing

2434.8 --> 2441.28
without another opposite thing it's the

2438.0 --> 2443.44
fractal of reality every person

2441.28 --> 2445.3590000000004
makes choices for a reason there's

2443.44 --> 2446.16
things that drive them to do things

2445.359 --> 2448.88
there's things

2446.16 --> 2449.359
in them that cause them to be deluded

2448.88 --> 2451.76
about

2449.359 --> 2453.2
things and then have another world view

2451.76 --> 2456.8
because of that

2453.2 --> 2460.48
that in their view might be good

2456.8 --> 2461.28
it's complicated things are very very

2460.48 --> 2464.319
complicated

2461.28 --> 2467.3590000000004
always in reality it's just

2464.319 --> 2469.2
do we want all that complication when we

2467.359 --> 2471.92
approach somebody

2469.2 --> 2473.68
out there that we've spotted being a

2471.92 --> 2475.28
liar about something or do we just say

2473.68 --> 2476.48
it's a liar it's a lie everything he

2475.28 --> 2480.0
does is a lie

2476.48 --> 2483.2
condemn him yeah that's very typical

2480.0 --> 2483.52
human behavior over generalizing making

2483.2 --> 2486.48
it

2483.52 --> 2487.68
simple so you don't doesn't have to take

2486.48 --> 2495.839
up all that attention

2487.68 --> 2495.839
span and focus right

2499.92 --> 2504.0
he must be a big liar or no space is

2503.599 --> 2506.0
fake

2504.0 --> 2509.839
right of course he knows space is fake

2506.0 --> 2509.839
he has to

2511.52 --> 2517.839
so that makes him from

2514.64 --> 2520.7999999999997
inside of his personal knowledge from a

2517.839 --> 2523.359
deluded normie status into an effective

2520.8 --> 2526.88
flat earther that is keeping it occult

2523.359 --> 2530.0
and basically using space belief

2526.88 --> 2533.76
as a dream factory platform

2530.0 --> 2533.76
that's what he's doing that's his setup

2534.079 --> 2540.5600000000004
now think of that what you will

2537.359 --> 2542.7999999999997
but if he knows space is fake then at

2540.56 --> 2546.96
least

2542.8 --> 2549.119
he's he has the faculties to realize

2546.96 --> 2551.839
flat earth and likes that there is

2549.119 --> 2551.839
something to it

2552.079 --> 2556.079
so he can be a complete dumbass

2562.839 --> 2565.839
see

2576.96 --> 2581.92
right mazar salim i agree

2580.24 --> 2583.52
that's exactly kind of what i try to

2581.92 --> 2586.56
point out

2583.52 --> 2588.48
although if you are very wealthy that

2586.56 --> 2592.7999999999997
doesn't automatically make you smart it

2588.48 --> 2595.839
just makes you ambitious

2592.8 --> 2599.04
and perhaps

2595.839 --> 2600.56
touched by the jew something like that

2599.04 --> 2602.4
like you just know how to deal with

2600.56 --> 2605.359
money or yeah

2602.4 --> 2607.52
people have trusted you enough to pour

2605.359 --> 2609.2799999999997
giant amounts of money on you to achieve

2607.52 --> 2611.44
something right that's really what that

2609.28 --> 2611.44
is

2618.16 --> 2626.96
but yeah you know

2622.72 --> 2629.4399999999996
once you pass a certain line of having

2626.96 --> 2630.56
wealth then you literally can't be

2629.44 --> 2633.04
stupid anymore

2630.56 --> 2633.7599999999998
because you're just gonna lose it

2633.04 --> 2636.079
literally

2633.76 --> 2637.8390000000004
you're just gonna lose it if you're not

2636.079 --> 2639.52
really smart

2637.839 --> 2641.44
and i don't think he's actually that

2639.52 --> 2642.24
rich i think that's just his corporate

2641.44 --> 2646.96
endeavor

2642.24 --> 2646.9599999999996
is that rich it's high on the scale

2647.52 --> 2652.4
you could say he's very well financed

2649.68 --> 2653.359
that does not necessarily make him rich

2652.4 --> 2657.28
per default

2653.359 --> 2658.56
he might be enjoying it doesn't make him

2657.28 --> 2662.3190000000004
per default rich

2658.56 --> 2665.44
i don't know like

2662.319 --> 2666.96
he can't just walk away like that i

2665.44 --> 2669.119
think i think that

2666.96 --> 2672.48
a lot of this money is literally because

2669.119 --> 2672.48
of what he's doing

2673.44 --> 2676.96
he's not like this multi-billionaire

2676.24 --> 2678.72
that just has

2676.96 --> 2681.04
billions on his bank account that are

2678.72 --> 2683.1189999999997
just guaranteed his

2681.04 --> 2684.079
that he can do with whatever he likes

2683.119 --> 2688.48
and he can just step

2684.079 --> 2691.04
away i don't think that's the situation

2688.48 --> 2691.76
his tesla cars make him a lot make a lot

2691.04 --> 2696.4
of money

2691.76 --> 2696.4
too does it does it really

2703.68 --> 2706.72
i don't know i think that the whole

2705.839 --> 2709.7599999999998
tesla car

2706.72 --> 2712.72
situation is is not

2709.76 --> 2713.599
as successful as you might think it's

2712.72 --> 2719.52
been a lot of

2713.599 --> 2722.7200000000003
disasters with that [ __ ]

2719.52 --> 2725.28
like bad design issues

2722.72 --> 2727.359
so but who knows maybe he corrected that

2725.28 --> 2729.44
right now i haven't kept too close track

2727.359 --> 2731.68
maybe he's got an improved version but

2729.44 --> 2733.839
come on like one of the demonstrations

2731.68 --> 2735.52
that you like oh this is unbreakable

2733.839 --> 2737.2799999999997
glass and it just throws a brick right

2735.52 --> 2740.16
through it

2737.28 --> 2741.8390000000004
the first go like that's come on you

2740.16 --> 2746.8799999999997
can't be seriously saying that

2741.839 --> 2751.44
tesla cars is making him a lot of money

2746.88 --> 2751.44
it's just no it's not how it works

2754.83 --> 2760.319
[Music]

2756.96 --> 2762.64
there's money being poured out over him

2760.319 --> 2764.079
because of vested interest in what he's

2762.64 --> 2766.64
doing

2764.079 --> 2767.92
i don't think he's been excessively

2766.64 --> 2775.359
successful

2767.92 --> 2779.52
in business really i don't think so

2775.359 --> 2779.52
fan of the flamethrower okay

2782.079 --> 2789.8390000000004
right exactly roger gets the point

2797.04 --> 2801.2
no george sanford stock markets are not

2798.96 --> 2803.68
just made up numbers but they are much

2801.2 --> 2805.359
easier to manipulate these days than

2803.68 --> 2807.1189999999997
people realize

2805.359 --> 2809.5989999999997
that's the reality of it it's not just

2807.119 --> 2813.2000000000003
made up numbers that it's not

2809.599 --> 2817.839
it doesn't work that way but it is much

2813.2 --> 2817.839
easier to manipulate than people realize

2831.83 --> 2835.0299999999997
[Music]

2841.76 --> 2845.8390000000004
set up success seat no

2846.16 --> 2852.64
he was set up to be a continual player

2849.68 --> 2854.3999999999996
he was set up for the big stage

2852.64 --> 2857.52
spotlight

2854.4 --> 2858.4500000000003
to be a bigger role actor

2857.52 --> 2861.56
in the play

2858.45 --> 2861.56
[Music]

2867.119 --> 2870.88
and with that very well backed to

2869.44 --> 2873.92
basically guarantee

2870.88 --> 2877.92
his continuation no matter the disasters

2873.92 --> 2877.92
see that's kind of the setup

2880.48 --> 2884.4
so yeah you could say it's to succeed

2884.48 --> 2890.88
but yeah his actual things that he does

2887.76 --> 2891.6800000000003
are not really all that successful on

2890.88 --> 2893.599
average

2891.68 --> 2896.64
doesn't have really the best success

2893.599 --> 2896.6400000000003
rate track record

2897.2 --> 2903.1189999999997
but he's always gonna come around

2901.119 --> 2904.96
because of his financial backing because

2903.119 --> 2907.839
of the vast vested interest

2904.96 --> 2914.96
in what he does and his role he's

2907.839 --> 2918.0
performing on the world stage

2914.96 --> 2920.88
yeah maybe it is very similar to the

2918.0 --> 2923.52
wright brothers legacy robin stanley

2920.88 --> 2924.8
that's kind of a good point it's the

2923.52 --> 2928.4
idea of oh we're

2924.8 --> 2931.76
technologically progressing people want

2928.4 --> 2934.0
that because it makes them reinvest in

2931.76 --> 2935.76
this idea we're all evolving into the

2934.0 --> 2938.319
space age

2935.76 --> 2939.2000000000003
and i think that yeah indeed elon is

2938.319 --> 2943.839
there to

2939.2 --> 2943.839
give that feeling it's still happening

2950.319 --> 2953.839
yes i know we all know that there's not

2953.2 --> 2955.5989999999997
a person

2953.839 --> 2958.24
in the world by now that doesn't know

2955.599 --> 2960.6400000000003
that terror 306

2958.24 --> 2960.64
really

2963.76 --> 2969.2000000000003
like it's that the very quote is almost

2966.88 --> 2970.6400000000003
synonymous to elon musk now if you've

2969.2 --> 2972.5589999999997
heard of the word

2970.64 --> 2973.68
if you heard the name elon musk and you

2972.559 --> 2976.88
know who it is

2973.68 --> 2978.5589999999997
then you probably know he said

2976.88 --> 2982.6400000000003
you know it's real because it looks so

2978.559 --> 2984.88
fake it's that's just a reality now

2982.64 --> 2987.68
right because everybody's gonna tell you

2984.88 --> 2987.6800000000003
that this is

2987.839 --> 2992.16
so yeah we heard of elon musk he said

2990.319 --> 2994.319
this yeah guess what's gonna happen

2992.16 --> 2999.839
everybody's gonna know he said that so

2994.319 --> 2999.839
yeah everybody knows that

3000.9 --> 3004.88
[Music]

3003.28 --> 3006.4
yeah duper's the light duper's the light

3004.88 --> 3008.559
you first delight the person light yeah

3006.4 --> 3011.2000000000003
yeah

3008.559 --> 3012.48
or just showing off that he has control

3011.2 --> 3015.359
over his audience

3012.48 --> 3017.2
maybe that's it you know is that duper's

3015.359 --> 3021.68
the light

3017.2 --> 3025.5989999999997
maybe maybe a little

3021.68 --> 3026.64
maybe a lot i don't know man if i were

3025.599 --> 3028.88
in his shoes i

3026.64 --> 3029.839
would damn well want to do that too you

3028.88 --> 3032.2400000000002
know i i

3029.839 --> 3033.44
duper delight the [ __ ] out of the place

3032.24 --> 3035.359
like half the things i

3033.44 --> 3037.68
would say would be covert duper's

3035.359 --> 3041.68
delight every step of the way

3037.68 --> 3044.7999999999997
because what else are you gonna do

3041.68 --> 3055.839
like you know what else is there to do

3044.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
to have fun with

3062.88 --> 3065.6800000000003
come on darren

3066.4 --> 3083.839
you're getting a little bit too obvious

3088.16 --> 3094.64
i've never if you've ever been to a

3091.599 --> 3097.52
hot air balloon festival

3094.64 --> 3100.7999999999997
hmm i've seen videos about that robin

3097.52 --> 3100.8
stanley pretty interesting

3102.72 --> 3108.64
and like hot air balloon

3106.16 --> 3110.16
riding in here in the netherlands is

3108.64 --> 3114.0789999999997
also quite a hobby

3110.16 --> 3117.2799999999997
i think like every if there's a good

3114.079 --> 3118.2400000000002
spring or summer you always do see end

3117.28 --> 3121.8390000000004
up seeing

3118.24 --> 3121.839
a couple of those types of balloons

3122.839 --> 3125.839
around

3136.839 --> 3141.44
hmm

3139.04 --> 3141.44
all right

3142.16 --> 3147.7599999999998
patricia dockery love is the answer

3149.44 --> 3154.4
so what you're talking about elon musk

3152.64 --> 3157.44
right

3154.4 --> 3161.119
because i i really like the guy is

3157.44 --> 3165.04
not just a typical i'm gonna destroy

3161.119 --> 3167.76
everything he's he's kind of trying to

3165.04 --> 3171.52
be

3167.76 --> 3171.92
the other side and that's why i don't

3171.52 --> 3173.68
just

3171.92 --> 3175.28
outright condemnance like are they

3173.68 --> 3178.8799999999997
stupid elon musk

3175.28 --> 3182.48
you just you should be arrested

3178.88 --> 3182.48
no i think that

3183.76 --> 3189.28
yeah he's there and i

3187.2 --> 3190.319
yeah i'd have to say he does make things

3189.28 --> 3194.6400000000003
interesting

3190.319 --> 3197.7599999999998
also for the flat earthers so just

3194.64 --> 3198.16
try not to just condemn everything you

3197.76 --> 3201.44
know

3198.16 --> 3204.8799999999997
constantly like who needs that

3201.44 --> 3207.2000000000003
nobody needs that just outright

3204.88 --> 3208.6400000000003
condemning of people constantly like who

3207.2 --> 3211.52
gives a [ __ ]

3208.64 --> 3213.839
nobody's gonna do anything about it

3211.52 --> 3215.2
especially not if you keep complaining

3213.839 --> 3218.319
like that

3215.2 --> 3219.1189999999997
literally like it will just cause people

3218.319 --> 3222.48
to just

3219.119 --> 3223.52
not care anymore eventually if you keep

3222.48 --> 3226.88
doing that

3223.52 --> 3229.359
you realize that they just are like

3226.88 --> 3230.6400000000003
can you please stop whining about it

3229.359 --> 3231.04
that's what's going to happen they'll

3230.64 --> 3234.16
just

3231.04 --> 3237.839
lose care about the message you're going

3234.16 --> 3237.839
to bring

3238.319 --> 3242.4
serious have you ever considered that

3248.24 --> 3253.359
i what i don't

3251.52 --> 3255.7599999999998
know what you're talking about bandsaw

3253.359 --> 3255.7599999999998
bandit

3255.92 --> 3261.6800000000003
there i don't know who that guy

3259.28 --> 3263.3590000000004
is and i don't know where there is i

3261.68 --> 3265.839
have absolutely no idea what you're

3263.359 --> 3265.839
talking about

3284.94 --> 3288.119
[Music]

3297.76 --> 3305.0400000000004
no raw iris no

3301.44 --> 3306.799
al atiyah is kind of talking the truth

3305.04 --> 3308.079
it's kind of just pointless to really

3306.799 --> 3310.64
say it like that

3308.079 --> 3312.079
especially with all the exclamation

3310.64 --> 3315.68
marks it's kind of

3312.079 --> 3318.2400000000002
savagne of him it's like yeah

3315.68 --> 3320.0789999999997
they are fantasizing a lot yeah they

3318.24 --> 3322.5589999999997
don't like to keep it strict

3320.079 --> 3325.119
especially with the scientific method

3322.559 --> 3330.079
they always deviate they always just

3325.119 --> 3334.0
endlessly philosophize to to wherever

3330.079 --> 3337.76
they do this always that's right

3334.0 --> 3339.119
to call it total this information

3337.76 --> 3340.96
that depends on what you're trying to

3339.119 --> 3341.76
achieve if you just want some

3340.96 --> 3344.96
generalized

3341.76 --> 3348.1600000000003
stories and ideas

3344.96 --> 3350.0
no if you want to get real

3348.16 --> 3351.68
with the scientific method and science

3350.0 --> 3355.839
and physics then

3351.68 --> 3363.839
yeah it's not all that helpful correct

3355.839 --> 3363.839
so it all depends you know

3365.44 --> 3369.119
there look you gotta realize just

3368.24 --> 3372.72
because

3369.119 --> 3374.0
we want this all figured out exactly we

3372.72 --> 3377.04
want to get hardcore

3374.0 --> 3380.0
real original and

3377.04 --> 3380.88
get all the disinformation out all of it

3380.0 --> 3383.04
right

3380.88 --> 3384.6400000000003
call it hardcore hardcore flattered

3383.04 --> 3386.5589999999997
whatever it's kind of stupid when i say

3384.64 --> 3389.359
it like that

3386.559 --> 3391.119
yeah now you got to realize that from

3389.359 --> 3393.44
all the other people

3391.119 --> 3394.2400000000002
that have accepted that flat earth is

3393.44 --> 3397.599
probably

3394.24 --> 3401.04
or is real and the globe is not

3397.599 --> 3404.1600000000003
guess what they don't give a fleeting

3401.04 --> 3408.48
[ __ ] about facts

3404.16 --> 3410.64
they just want other nice stories

3408.48 --> 3412.4
especially if it relates to flat earth

3410.64 --> 3414.24
because that's what they're into now

3412.4 --> 3415.64
you really think that these people give

3414.24 --> 3418.16
a [ __ ] if

3415.64 --> 3420.24
scientific method is technically correct

3418.16 --> 3420.72
no that probably bores the [ __ ] out of

3420.24 --> 3423.52
them

3420.72 --> 3425.359
right just because we're like that

3423.52 --> 3429.359
doesn't mean

3425.359 --> 3432.4
that a hundred thousand other people

3429.359 --> 3435.04
are also like that no they're just

3432.4 --> 3435.6800000000003
switching the story they like to listen

3435.04 --> 3437.2
to

3435.68 --> 3439.1189999999997
because they were always just listening

3437.2 --> 3440.799
to a story now they figured out the

3439.119 --> 3442.799
earth is flat and those stories don't

3440.799 --> 3443.68
work anymore for them it makes them feel

3442.799 --> 3446.52
stupid

3443.68 --> 3447.7599999999998
and deceived so they want another

3446.52 --> 3450.48
storytelling

3447.76 --> 3452.3190000000004
well guess what guess what they do at

3450.48 --> 3454.96
the globe busters

3452.319 --> 3456.24
they provide just that so yeah those

3454.96 --> 3457.76
people that are watching it they don't

3456.24 --> 3460.8799999999997
give a [ __ ]

3457.76 --> 3464.3190000000004
about technically correct they just want

3460.88 --> 3466.559
another's flat earth scientist that just

3464.319 --> 3468.5589999999997
talks all these amazing stories of how

3466.559 --> 3471.8390000000004
reality is supposed to work

3468.559 --> 3473.52
from a flat earth perspective right

3471.839 --> 3475.52
it's kind of superficial like that

3473.52 --> 3476.96
that's how it works that's what they

3475.52 --> 3478.799
want

3476.96 --> 3480.48
and if you try to take it from them

3478.799 --> 3482.16
they're just going to respond like a

3480.48 --> 3484.72
glober does

3482.16 --> 3486.799
when you disrupt their dreaming session

3484.72 --> 3489.1189999999997
with dr becky for example or

3486.799 --> 3490.24
some of these other global fantasist

3489.119 --> 3491.52
storytellers

3490.24 --> 3494.799
they're just gonna act the same like

3491.52 --> 3498.48
stop whining why are you attacking

3494.799 --> 3500.24
you're just a chill or you're anti

3498.48 --> 3502.319
blah blah blah that that's just gonna

3500.24 --> 3503.5989999999997
happen because you got to realize what

3502.319 --> 3506.88
are those people

3503.599 --> 3506.88
coming there for

3506.96 --> 3510.559
you're coming to checking either are

3508.72 --> 3512.3999999999996
they actually technically correct or are

3510.559 --> 3516.0
they being fantasised right that's

3512.4 --> 3517.28
what you care about because you realized

3516.0 --> 3521.839
it's kind of important

3517.28 --> 3525.6800000000003
to progress do they care about that

3521.839 --> 3527.44
no no they don't

3525.68 --> 3529.52
because if they did they would make a

3527.44 --> 3533.839
lot more effort to actually be

3529.52 --> 3533.839
and stay that they're not so

3533.92 --> 3536.96
you got to realize

3537.119 --> 3540.48
why is it there what function is it

3539.119 --> 3543.28
performing why

3540.48 --> 3545.04
would so many people want to continue

3543.28 --> 3548.6400000000003
listening to that

3545.04 --> 3551.7599999999998
i just explain exactly why

3548.64 --> 3554.8799999999997
just leave it just leave them to

3551.76 --> 3554.88
what they want

3555.92 --> 3560.16
it's really completely useless to just

3558.079 --> 3561.44
complain about how technically incorrect

3560.16 --> 3564.799
they are all the time

3561.44 --> 3566.559
i mean it's good to say it if it's not

3564.799 --> 3569.119
known

3566.559 --> 3570.3190000000004
but to really then start to advertise

3569.119 --> 3572.7200000000003
out how

3570.319 --> 3573.359
how bad they are that's just that's just

3572.72 --> 3575.7599999999998
stupid

3573.359 --> 3577.44
it's a waste of your energy because the

3575.76 --> 3582.4
people watch it

3577.44 --> 3582.4
for what it is for what they want out of

3584.839 --> 3587.839
it

3589.76 --> 3595.8390000000004
yeah i know i know that roy ayers

3593.68 --> 3602.48
i did give praise to which it gets it

3595.839 --> 3602.48
and he is a glow buster that's right

3603.76 --> 3607.2000000000003
it's very obvious he's not perfect and

3606.559 --> 3611.599
he does

3607.2 --> 3614.0789999999997
kind of like go there

3611.599 --> 3614.88
but at the same time when you take him

3614.079 --> 3616.6400000000003
separately

3614.88 --> 3619.52
he just proves that he's technically

3616.64 --> 3628.24
very apt he's very well aware

3619.52 --> 3631.2
and i respect that

3628.24 --> 3631.2
why is that awkward

3636.72 --> 3641.04
yeah i know mother salim it's silly

3639.76 --> 3643.92
you no longer require no drips you

3641.04 --> 3645.92
observe it's just dude

3643.92 --> 3648.64
that's what they do this is what they've

3645.92 --> 3648.64
always done

3649.119 --> 3652.7200000000003
they just want absolute mechanical

3652.079 --> 3655.599
freedom

3652.72 --> 3656.9599999999996
to assert whatever the [ __ ] of thoughts

3655.599 --> 3659.599
they want

3656.96 --> 3661.52
and try to reify as much of it into

3659.599 --> 3663.28
physical reality as they can

3661.52 --> 3665.2
so they can pretend to be the new

3663.28 --> 3667.28
masters of creation

3665.2 --> 3669.1189999999997
like we figured it all out oh yeah we're

3667.28 --> 3670.799
not exactly using the scientific method

3669.119 --> 3673.119
anymore but it doesn't matter because

3670.799 --> 3676.16
the model works the moral works

3673.119 --> 3678.0
oh yeah that's what you get

3676.16 --> 3679.839
and there's people that want that they

3678.0 --> 3682.24
want it

3679.839 --> 3684.5589999999997
they're not gonna let you take it from

3682.24 --> 3699.839
them do you understand

3684.559 --> 3699.8390000000004
there's nothing you could do about it

3701.01 --> 3704.5190000000002
[Music]

3712.64 --> 3719.2799999999997
yep models they're very

3716.319 --> 3719.2799999999997
very appealing

3720.16 --> 3723.92
if you get too close they always break

3723.2 --> 3727.839
your heart

3723.92 --> 3727.839
in the end

3737.06 --> 3740.179
[Music]

3761.839 --> 3773.7599999999998
all right

3769.2 --> 3773.7599999999998
so i hope you guys take that too hard

3778.96 --> 3782.96
all right yeah mother celine why i used

3780.799 --> 3786.96
to date one sorry i used to

3782.96 --> 3797.839
live with one for three years so

3786.96 --> 3797.839
yeah i know what i'm talking about there

3799.359 --> 3811.839
energy flows where attention goes yep

3829.52 --> 3836.16
people need a model no they don't

3832.88 --> 3839.039
but once they and a model drag

3836.16 --> 3839.92
yeah captivates their attention then

3839.039 --> 3842.96
they will

3839.92 --> 3846.0
feel a need for that model that's right

3842.96 --> 3848.16
it's very typical isn't it that yeah it

3846.0 --> 3853.839
accounts for both

3848.16 --> 3853.839
conceptual models and people models

3854.079 --> 3859.28
once one of them captivates their minds

3857.119 --> 3860.2400000000002
then they do absolutely think that they

3859.28 --> 3863.6800000000003
need it

3860.24 --> 3864.799
that's right this is just the force of

3863.68 --> 3867.839
habit

3864.799 --> 3867.839
hold on i'll be right back

3976.839 --> 3979.839
hello

3984.96 --> 3988.909
[Music]

4002.24 --> 4007.839
right yeah good point there ben saw

4004.88 --> 4007.839
bandit

4026.72 --> 4031.359
okay don't don't ever ask me such a

4029.2 --> 4034.0789999999997
question

4031.359 --> 4034.64
rob ayers i look it's in the middle of

4034.079 --> 4036.7200000000003
the day

4034.64 --> 4037.92
i don't even drink alcohol and when i

4036.72 --> 4042.0
would i would never

4037.92 --> 4042.0
drink anything like that

4042.319 --> 4045.44
never anything hard and especially not

4044.48 --> 4047.92
during the day or

4045.44 --> 4048.64
the stream what the hell who do you

4047.92 --> 4052.88
think i am

4048.64 --> 4062.6
dude that's like an insult to me

4052.88 --> 4065.79
don't say that ever again

4062.6 --> 4065.79
[Music]

4079.92 --> 4091.839
all right i thought so yeah

4092.4 --> 4097.279
just so you know you might think it's

4094.079 --> 4100.400000000001
all just normal or whatever

4097.279 --> 4102.2390000000005
right well to me that sounds like oh are

4100.4 --> 4105.44
you drunk are we in because you sound

4102.239 --> 4107.5199999999995
drunk do i sound drunk

4105.44 --> 4109.199
do i sound like somebody that's sipping

4107.52 --> 4112.2390000000005
on whiskey

4109.199 --> 4115.2789999999995
at two o'clock in the afternoon

4112.239 --> 4119.839
on a monday really do i sound like that

4115.279 --> 4119.839000000001
uh no

4120.08 --> 4123.12
right so yes there's been ballers that

4121.92 --> 4125.12
make that kind of jokes

4123.12 --> 4126.48
too and i usually end up banning them

4125.12 --> 4128.3189999999995
now

4126.48 --> 4130.639999999999
i've read what you've written down in

4128.319 --> 4133.839000000001
chat so far so i just think that

4130.64 --> 4135.359
you were not intending that that's why i

4133.839 --> 4138.719
said this

4135.359 --> 4147.839
i just don't i don't drink anymore

4138.719 --> 4147.839
stopped pretty much a month ago

4148.799 --> 4153.679
hey julio pepin good to see you

4158.0 --> 4161.839
right yeah rob ayers

4184.88 --> 4189.839
look alcohol is just trouble

4188.08 --> 4191.679
for a lot of people and there's some

4189.839 --> 4194.5599999999995
people that take it really well

4191.679 --> 4195.36
sort of nobody really ever takes it

4194.56 --> 4198.64
really well

4195.36 --> 4200.4
there's always a surprise always another

4198.64 --> 4204.08
don't take it well at all some

4200.4 --> 4206.32
hate it uh i'm

4204.08 --> 4208.32
like i'm not saying that i'm quitting

4206.32 --> 4209.84
forever even though i kind of did say

4208.32 --> 4212.719
that at the start of it

4209.84 --> 4214.2390000000005
never drink again because i got really

4212.719 --> 4216.32
freaking sick from just looking at

4214.239 --> 4219.759999999999
drinking a little bit too much

4216.32 --> 4223.04
but i never drink strong anyway just

4219.76 --> 4226.400000000001
like two organic beers that was what i

4223.04 --> 4229.84
usually took which is like one liter of

4226.4 --> 4231.839999999999
organic regular beer like oh my god i'm

4229.84 --> 4234.400000000001
such an alcoholic man

4231.84 --> 4236.8
though i did drink it every day and i

4234.4 --> 4239.12
just quit that and that's it

4236.8 --> 4240.4800000000005
i can't handle alcohol i and i think

4239.12 --> 4245.28
it's disgusting

4240.48 --> 4247.36
like it just it just makes me dumb

4245.28 --> 4249.36
when i drink a lot of it it just makes

4247.36 --> 4254.48
me dumb i don't like it

4249.36 --> 4258.0
at all it shaves away my finer faculties

4254.48 --> 4262.718999999999
makes me have trouble concentrating when

4258.0 --> 4266.56
tackling complicated issues so

4262.719 --> 4269.36
and even just those two beers every day

4266.56 --> 4271.679
had a minor influence it wasn't a huge

4269.36 --> 4274.0
impact but it was enough for me to now

4271.679 --> 4275.12
decide like now i don't want to shave

4274.0 --> 4279.6
that

4275.12 --> 4279.599999999999
10 off the top anymore

4281.12 --> 4287.84
white man's poison excuse me

4285.04 --> 4287.84
uh

4288.08 --> 4290.4
what

4291.12 --> 4298.88
sorry but there's alcoholics in like

4295.12 --> 4303.44
every skin color

4298.88 --> 4306.719
so that seems kind of dumb thing to say

4303.44 --> 4306.719
like serious

4312.0 --> 4317.12
god does the senses no i disagree

4317.28 --> 4322.48
not uh look alco will do different

4320.4 --> 4324.239
things for different people

4322.48 --> 4326.799999999999
i don't really want to get into it i

4324.239 --> 4329.839999999999
don't drink anymore

4326.8 --> 4329.84
right now at least

4345.52 --> 4349.120000000001
dude it's easy don't talk to people like

4348.239 --> 4353.28
that

4349.12 --> 4355.76
just don't that's

4353.28 --> 4357.84
it's just not civil way of going about

4355.76 --> 4360.320000000001
dude if somebody's drinking

4357.84 --> 4361.6
and you hate it there's people going to

4360.32 --> 4364.719
be drinking so just

4361.6 --> 4371.84
let's not get

4364.719 --> 4371.84
all aggro on one another okay

4372.56 --> 4385.84
it's the human race poison right

4401.679 --> 4406.0
yeah robin stanley i think there's some

4403.84 --> 4406.32
guys that apparently feel the need to

4406.0 --> 4413.84
start

4406.32 --> 4413.84
duking it out over something pointless

4416.239 --> 4423.678999999999
because what is more useful than one guy

4420.719 --> 4425.679
being agitated with somebody else for

4423.679 --> 4426.08
not being totally against drinking when

4425.679 --> 4428.64
the other

4426.08 --> 4431.679
person just wants to have their drink

4428.64 --> 4434.0
and be left alone about it

4431.679 --> 4434.719
and then get aggro with one like what is

4434.0 --> 4436.0
it

4434.719 --> 4438.56
could you think of something more

4436.0 --> 4438.56
productive

4438.84 --> 4441.84
uh

4458.159 --> 4462.4
right anyway i got 10 more minutes

4460.48 --> 4465.759999999999
before the show ends and then i go

4462.4 --> 4468.32
to the flat earth debates so

4465.76 --> 4470.0
anything other than freaking alcohol you

4468.32 --> 4471.84
guys want me to talk about because i'm

4470.0 --> 4474.8
kind of done with that right now i don't

4471.84 --> 4474.8
want to talk about it

4475.25 --> 4483.84
[Music]

4477.52 --> 4483.84
tire of lifestyle managers right

4508.32 --> 4515.04
yeah i'm just trying to go about

4511.679 --> 4517.4400000000005
sensibly and not

4515.04 --> 4518.4
just make extreme decisions like never

4517.44 --> 4521.599999999999
this

4518.4 --> 4524.159
always that unless i

4521.6 --> 4526.08
feel that that's really not gonna pose

4524.159 --> 4526.719
any problem because i'm not gonna in the

4526.08 --> 4529.28
moment

4526.719 --> 4530.8
just do that anymore it's so useless it

4529.28 --> 4534.5599999999995
just makes you feel stupid

4530.8 --> 4536.8
when you break with that decision

4534.56 --> 4538.2390000000005
that's why i feel kind of stupid when i

4536.8 --> 4540.159000000001
like a month ago said

4538.239 --> 4542.159
i'm never drinking it again under

4540.159 --> 4544.4
contract of assassination but

4542.159 --> 4545.599999999999
yeah that's just really dumb now that i

4544.4 --> 4547.679
said that but again

4545.6 --> 4550.400000000001
it was kind of obvious that i was

4547.679 --> 4553.04
foaming at the mouth rage

4550.4 --> 4554.0
just had a lot of frustration potted up

4553.04 --> 4558.0
and

4554.0 --> 4562.96
that came out like yeah savage maniac

4558.0 --> 4562.96
as i described it so i hope that kind of

4564.0 --> 4568.64
fixes that i do get a little like that

4567.28 --> 4571.759999999999
sometimes

4568.64 --> 4573.92
let's talk thc no let's not

4571.76 --> 4575.1990000000005
let's not talk freaking drugs how about

4573.92 --> 4578.2390000000005
that how about let's

4575.199 --> 4581.5199999999995
not talk about drugs okay

4578.239 --> 4584.799999999999
this is a flat earth early bird show

4581.52 --> 4587.040000000001
where we don't talk about drugs

4584.8 --> 4589.12
all the time let's talk about things

4587.04 --> 4591.36
that are actually

4589.12 --> 4592.48
things you could learn something from

4591.36 --> 4595.839999999999
and not just

4592.48 --> 4595.839999999999
drugs okay

4596.21 --> 4600.719
[Music]

4597.52 --> 4603.52
you're getting a timeout for that

4600.719 --> 4606.719
next time you're banned not talk about

4603.52 --> 4606.719
drugs how about that

4606.84 --> 4609.84
huh

4617.679 --> 4623.4400000000005
yeah betty l thanks i don't

4620.96 --> 4625.679
feel like that i'm just getting really

4623.44 --> 4628.32
sick of people constantly talking about

4625.679 --> 4630.64
drugs all the time

4628.32 --> 4632.639999999999
how about we talk about some cosmogeny

4630.64 --> 4636.719
how about we talk about

4632.64 --> 4639.76
spiritual things just life lessons or

4636.719 --> 4641.679
it's just come on guys is this all

4639.76 --> 4644.0
that's left for you people

4641.679 --> 4646.32
just talking about drugs and talking

4644.0 --> 4648.88
about how much of a liar some

4646.32 --> 4650.0
person in media is is that's it is that

4648.88 --> 4652.719
all there is

4650.0 --> 4653.04
is that all that you can conceive of so

4652.719 --> 4656.4
no

4653.04 --> 4658.4
actual interesting questions anything

4656.4 --> 4660.879999999999
you do realize i could potentially

4658.4 --> 4661.759999999999
answer any conceivable question right

4660.88 --> 4664.56
and i have

4661.76 --> 4665.12
every single freaking time when people

4664.56 --> 4667.120000000001
think

4665.12 --> 4669.199
they're asking me trick question i

4667.12 --> 4672.08
answer them instantly

4669.199 --> 4674.159
yeah so can you please all stop wasting

4672.08 --> 4676.5599999999995
my time and energy with this nonsense

4674.159 --> 4679.679
talk about drugs

4676.56 --> 4682.88
and about how stupid certain people are

4679.679 --> 4685.04
sorry that i kind of

4682.88 --> 4687.12
am partially to blame myself but i'm

4685.04 --> 4688.88
really getting agitated about it now i

4687.12 --> 4691.44
want to talk about real things

4688.88 --> 4692.4800000000005
this is making me fall asleep really it

4691.44 --> 4694.4
is

4692.48 --> 4695.919999999999
it's boring i don't want to talk about

4694.4 --> 4698.0
freaking drugs

4695.92 --> 4700.2390000000005
i want to talk about interesting things

4698.0 --> 4703.679
that you can learn from

4700.239 --> 4707.759999999999
okay yeah flat earth

4703.679 --> 4707.76
that's right you can talk about flat

4718.84 --> 4723.4400000000005
earth

4720.56 --> 4725.1990000000005
okay well that's a question at least how

4723.44 --> 4727.199
do you think the world will end will it

4725.199 --> 4730.239
end will it go on forever

4727.199 --> 4733.5199999999995
well here's my answer i don't know

4730.239 --> 4734.0
i don't really give a [ __ ] i'm just here

4733.52 --> 4737.679
to try

4734.0 --> 4741.04
and follow logos my life and not

4737.679 --> 4744.56
get bogged down into

4741.04 --> 4747.36
divine issues that are way

4744.56 --> 4747.360000000001
over my head

4747.679 --> 4752.32
i like to think i'd like to help prevent

4750.159 --> 4756.879999999999
the end of the world

4752.32 --> 4760.4
but i'm not gonna kid myself with that

4756.88 --> 4762.64
if the designer god decrees it will

4760.4 --> 4764.08
end then it will end and there's nothing

4762.64 --> 4766.0
i can do about it

4764.08 --> 4768.88
and i don't really like to speculate

4766.0 --> 4768.88
about it either

4771.52 --> 4778.64
it's just like yeah

4776.239 --> 4781.04
do you really want to sit through those

4778.64 --> 4782.88
last moments every single time and think

4781.04 --> 4784.88
about that how everything and

4782.88 --> 4788.08
everybody's dying or something like

4784.88 --> 4791.6
why why

4788.08 --> 4792.159
do you obsess over ironmanic [ __ ] like

4791.6 --> 4795.52
that

4792.159 --> 4795.5199999999995
why can't you just live

4796.64 --> 4799.679
oh it's always freaking obsessed about

4798.88 --> 4802.64
the end

4799.679 --> 4802.64
sorry it's just

4802.8 --> 4808.639
you at least ask the question right

4806.8 --> 4812.719
i don't think it will go on forever

4808.639 --> 4812.719
because nothing physical ever does

4812.88 --> 4816.0
i don't think we're gonna see the end of

4815.199 --> 4819.759999999999
the world

4816.0 --> 4822.0
by a long long shot

4819.76 --> 4825.12
but if we will yeah then it might be

4822.0 --> 4828.56
over in exactly seven days

4825.12 --> 4831.679
or not it's completely

4828.56 --> 4832.320000000001
useless to ponder on it because every

4831.679 --> 4834.2390000000005
time

4832.32 --> 4836.4
you'll just end up having wasted your

4834.239 --> 4837.839999999999
time or it's real and it doesn't really

4836.4 --> 4842.0
matter anyway

4837.84 --> 4844.400000000001
see so the end of the world

4842.0 --> 4845.04
doesn't matter all that matters is that

4844.4 --> 4848.799999999999
you

4845.04 --> 4852.96
deal with the world as it is right now

4848.8 --> 4861.84
the best you can and the wisest you can

4852.96 --> 4861.84
and learn

4869.36 --> 4872.159
yeah samson

4873.04 --> 4876.32
it's actually a very sensible thing to

4875.44 --> 4878.48
do

4876.32 --> 4880.639
it's one of the lessons that my dad has

4878.48 --> 4882.0
been trying to teach me in the last 20

4880.639 --> 4885.12
years

4882.0 --> 4887.679
in that i just every time but this but

4885.12 --> 4889.92
that but this but that but this but and

4887.679 --> 4892.8
now i figured out like yeah

4889.92 --> 4894.159
i can finally stop doing that stupid but

4892.8 --> 4896.320000000001
this but that that

4894.159 --> 4897.839999999999
maybe i should just freaking do it

4896.32 --> 4900.239
because every time

4897.84 --> 4901.04
every year every half year there's some

4900.239 --> 4903.12
new reason

4901.04 --> 4905.199
but this but that but this every

4903.12 --> 4908.719
freaking time

4905.199 --> 4911.28
maybe we should just live

4908.719 --> 4911.76
just that no longer get distracted by

4911.28 --> 4917.84
these

4911.76 --> 4917.84
impulsive existential nonsense things

4919.6 --> 4923.360000000001
it has already happened well then it's

4921.6 --> 4925.679
completely pointless to ponder on it

4923.36 --> 4925.679
anyway

4926.32 --> 4933.44
and there's no aliens there is no aliens

4930.32 --> 4936.32
there is no outer space

4933.44 --> 4936.638999999999
doesn't exist whatever you conceive of

4936.32 --> 4939.679
as

4936.639 --> 4943.28
aliens are extra dimensional spirits

4939.679 --> 4945.4400000000005
or spirits of humans made to look like

4943.28 --> 4949.04
aliens are transformed into

4945.44 --> 4949.919999999999
something non-human everything about

4949.04 --> 4952.4
aliens

4949.92 --> 4954.719
is in the other dimension in the virtual

4952.4 --> 4956.48
dimension the spirit dimension it's not

4954.719 --> 4959.12
real nobody's ever seen an

4956.48 --> 4961.44
actual living being that you would

4959.12 --> 4961.92
identify as an alien in the physical

4961.44 --> 4965.28
world

4961.92 --> 4970.159
there may have been props made

4965.28 --> 4973.04
no living thing in the physical world

4970.159 --> 4974.4
that you would call an alien there is

4973.04 --> 4977.5199999999995
not

4974.4 --> 4977.5199999999995
i guarantee it

4978.239 --> 4981.919999999999
doesn't mean you'll never see them

4979.84 --> 4984.96
because yeah you got dreams

4981.92 --> 4987.4400000000005
right you got dreams so

4984.96 --> 4989.44
there will be aliens i've seen aliens in

4987.44 --> 4991.36
dreams

4989.44 --> 4992.799999999999
doesn't mean that they are physical

4991.36 --> 4994.4
beings you know and that's what

4992.8 --> 4995.84
some of these cultists like to talk

4994.4 --> 4998.32
about say like yeah they're

4995.84 --> 4999.92
communicating to us through dreams yeah

4998.32 --> 5002.0
yeah that's very cute that doesn't mean

4999.92 --> 5002.639
there's a physical entity on a planet

5002.0 --> 5005.92
somewhere

5002.639 --> 5007.679
or in a ship doing that it just means

5005.92 --> 5009.12
you're communicating with something

5007.679 --> 5011.6
through your dreams

5009.12 --> 5012.639
that seems to have some persistent

5011.6 --> 5014.639
appearance

5012.639 --> 5016.0
that you would typically associate with

5014.639 --> 5019.679
aliens

5016.0 --> 5022.4
by the artwork which it is artwork

5019.679 --> 5023.679
the artwork of aliens the icons the

5022.4 --> 5029.839999999999
grays

5023.679 --> 5029.84
the look of that all that right

5041.679 --> 5048.96
yeah i think cz is a bit of a glober

5046.719 --> 5051.12
yeah there is no aliens it's only

5048.96 --> 5053.199
spirits and those spirits just like all

5051.12 --> 5056.32
the other spirits

5053.199 --> 5056.96
are timeless and they see you at all

5056.32 --> 5060.0
times

5056.96 --> 5060.639
at all times always it's nothing you can

5060.0 --> 5063.35
hide

5060.639 --> 5064.719
from the spirits nothing at all

5063.35 --> 5067.92
[Music]

5064.719 --> 5070.2390000000005
doesn't mean anything because it always

5067.92 --> 5072.56
is like that it always has been whether

5070.239 --> 5074.08
you become conscious of it or not

5072.56 --> 5075.76
that's what it is that's how the

5074.08 --> 5078.0
mechanics

5075.76 --> 5079.04
of the dimensions and the physical realm

5078.0 --> 5081.84
work

5079.04 --> 5082.719
in the spirit realm that's how i figured

5081.84 --> 5086.96
it out

5082.719 --> 5086.96
so aliens are not physical beings

5087.76 --> 5091.6
right i'm gonna round out the show so

5090.159 --> 5094.638999999999
thanks everyone for coming

5094.639 --> 5099.36
