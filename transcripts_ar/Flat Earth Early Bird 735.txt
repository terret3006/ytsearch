but i kind of woke up

88.64 --> 93.68
five minutes to one

91.68 --> 94.72000000000001
i'm actually surprised i got this all

93.68 --> 97.84
together

94.72 --> 100.96
in just 15 minutes really

97.84 --> 102.88000000000001
because i bolted up from my badge like

100.96 --> 104.72
well i didn't balls up i just thought

102.88 --> 106.15899999999999
like oh it's probably 11 o'clock or

104.72 --> 108.0
something but as soon as i looked on the

106.159 --> 111.84
clock like what

108.0 --> 115.2
five to one no freaking way damn it

111.84 --> 117.36
so i just yeah rushed to get my

115.2 --> 121.60000000000001
breakfast and everything together

117.36 --> 126.24
so i got green tea it's still in the pot

121.6 --> 129.92
i got rusk with strawberry jelly

126.24 --> 134.0
it's my new favorite and i got a a cup

129.92 --> 135.92
of regular coffee and

134.0 --> 139.12
just took all my supplements morning

135.92 --> 142.23899999999998
supplements and so i'm ready to go

139.12 --> 144.239
i'm bursting with energy i just

142.239 --> 146.239
had a very long sleep i guess i needed

144.239 --> 148.879
it i had a very

146.239 --> 149.44
very big dinner again a chicken dinner

148.879 --> 151.92
but

149.44 --> 154.239
oh yeah lots of stuff on top of that

151.92 --> 154.23899999999998
even

154.4 --> 158.48000000000002
because i also got my christmas package

156.8 --> 161.76000000000002
in

158.48 --> 164.79999999999998
from the organic store yeah

161.76 --> 167.519
that like you save up like every 10

164.8 --> 170.239
euros you spend you get a sticker

167.519 --> 171.04
and then eventually you get if you got

170.239 --> 172.72
enough

171.04 --> 174.64
you can hand it over and you get a

172.72 --> 176.16
little package with all kinds of stuff

174.64 --> 179.83999999999997
in there

176.16 --> 179.84
and that's really nice to have

180.8 --> 187.76000000000002
which supplements do i take can you be

184.0 --> 189.76
noise nosy yeah sure why not

187.76 --> 190.79999999999998
since you're at least first here we go

189.76 --> 194.79999999999998
again

190.8 --> 194.8
yeah uh in the mornings i take

196.4 --> 203.20000000000002
i take vitamin d3 i take vitamin k

199.599 --> 207.04
take k2 selenium

203.2 --> 213.35999999999999
vitamin c and vitamin b12

207.04 --> 215.68
that's what i take in the morning

213.36 --> 217.92000000000002
especially the d3 and the k2 very

215.68 --> 221.20000000000002
important for the winter

217.92 --> 224.55999999999997
vitamin c i take not

221.2 --> 229.2
like i don't need to always take it but

224.56 --> 231.92000000000002
it's just yeah i have been sick

229.2 --> 235.92
not too long ago and it's always good to

231.92 --> 235.92
have that for extra protection for

238.84 --> 241.84
strengthening

245.2 --> 250.959
and yeah the b12

248.48 --> 253.04
is like it always works really well for

250.959 --> 254.64000000000001
me in the morning

253.04 --> 256.71999999999997
then i just need a little bit of it i

254.64 --> 259.68
got these really basic

256.72 --> 260.56
ass chewing tablets that are kind of

259.68 --> 263.68
sweet

260.56 --> 265.919
it's like this micro candy but it's

263.68 --> 267.52
yeah it's good and it was really cheap

265.919 --> 268.08
and it's enough you know you could have

267.52 --> 270.4
like this

268.08 --> 272.4
super super expensive b12 and it's

270.4 --> 274.79999999999995
really awesome

272.4 --> 277.52
but the cheap ass stuff kind of works

274.8 --> 277.52000000000004
just as fine

277.84 --> 283.11999999999995
i don't need it but it just

281.04 --> 285.04
is so easy for just this little extra

283.12 --> 287.52
kick that's it

285.04 --> 287.52000000000004
anyway

288.32 --> 292.71999999999997
hey ryan eartherton good morning

292.96 --> 297.84
dammit my co coffee is getting cold

295.12 --> 297.84000000000003
quick

298.639 --> 302.0
i just made this

300.42 --> 304.40000000000003
[Music]

302.0 --> 306.56
man i have to chuck all that stuff these

304.4 --> 310.79999999999995
days

306.56 --> 314.4
it is kind of cold though so because

310.8 --> 317.199
it is winter out there and currently

314.4 --> 317.19899999999996
this is the weather

317.36 --> 324.32
it's a big big super

320.88 --> 326.96
gray clouds up there and

324.32 --> 330.15999999999997
no distinct shapes or anything doesn't

326.96 --> 334.88
seem to be a lot of wind either

330.16 --> 338.16
but it's yeah this is sometimes

334.88 --> 341.039
wet and other times not it's it's

338.16 --> 342.32000000000005
cold it's not the most pleasant of

341.039 --> 345.44
weathers out there

342.32 --> 346.8
oh look in there i think they're trying

345.44 --> 350.16
to

346.8 --> 352.24
they're closing the gap between the

350.16 --> 353.44
bridge and the ground because the bridge

352.24 --> 354.96000000000004
was kind of higher

353.44 --> 357.759
than the ground so i think they're

354.96 --> 361.12
trying to build a ramp up to it now

357.759 --> 363.44
it's like a scooper over there

361.12 --> 366.24
at the end of this road i don't know if

363.44 --> 368.16
you can see it

366.24 --> 370.08
very curious to see what this bridge is

368.16 --> 372.639
going to be like like

370.08 --> 374.88
i kind of like bridges you know like

372.639 --> 378.8
metaphorically and literally i like

374.88 --> 381.199
bridges bridges are awesome

378.8 --> 382.24
bridge yeah bridges are bridges they

381.199 --> 385.039
connect things

382.24 --> 385.039
over water

385.36 --> 387.68
all right

390.0 --> 395.84
so right

396.479 --> 403.44
yeah yesterday was heavy day no surprise

400.639 --> 404.72
especially in the show i connected it

403.44 --> 406.24
back to some people

404.72 --> 409.12
what had happened i don't want to get

406.24 --> 412.24
into it too much

409.12 --> 415.44
but yeah certain individual just

412.24 --> 417.199
came rolling in like a demon just like

415.44 --> 420.4
that

417.199 --> 420.8
didn't talk about them before in the

420.4 --> 423.75899999999996
show

420.8 --> 426.0
single time just came rolling in just

423.759 --> 428.96000000000004
like a demon just like that

426.0 --> 428.96
really freaky

429.919 --> 437.19899999999996
and uh yeah i gots uh

433.28 --> 439.44
i i gots screenshots

437.199 --> 441.52000000000004
and i sent them to a couple of people

439.44 --> 443.68
just to show like yeah this is

441.52 --> 446.56
this is not me making [ __ ] up didn't

443.68 --> 446.56
that really happen

447.28 --> 453.919
and i also sent around

450.8 --> 456.16
that that link afterward as a punishment

453.919 --> 459.039
because i i wasn't really planning to

456.16 --> 459.03900000000004
throw that out there

460.0 --> 464.08
and yeah some people apparently watched

462.56 --> 466.879
that and had a really tough

464.08 --> 467.28
time because of it so i'm sorry about

466.879 --> 471.03900000000004
that

467.28 --> 473.67999999999995
here we go again yeah that that

471.039 --> 475.36
you were quite upset about what you had

473.68 --> 478.479
seen

475.36 --> 480.56
and the weird thing is i don't even

478.479 --> 481.12
remember the whole thing i was their

480.56 --> 484.56
life

481.12 --> 488.0
i was there in chat life

484.56 --> 490.879
listening when that was happening

488.0 --> 492.08
and i don't even remember it fully and i

490.879 --> 495.12
don't want to remember

492.08 --> 498.96
it because i knew like i was just

495.12 --> 502.0
being a bomb there like like

498.96 --> 505.75899999999996
like i i want to explode i

502.0 --> 508.72
i want to absolutely send

505.759 --> 509.12
shards of metal right through everyone

508.72 --> 511.68
and

509.12 --> 514.08
rip them all open bleeding them to death

511.68 --> 516.719
that that's what i was at the time

514.08 --> 517.279
and it was like yeah if i'm gonna do

516.719 --> 519.519
that

517.279 --> 521.279
then everybody's going to hate on me and

519.519 --> 524.399
they're all going to [ __ ] over me

521.279 --> 527.6
so i'm just going to have to sit there

524.399 --> 531.04
and swallow this and forget about it

527.6 --> 536.72
and then see what happens

531.04 --> 541.04
yeah and yeah it's been a long time and

536.72 --> 541.0400000000001
and now that bomb has finally exploded

541.279 --> 549.8389999999999
and oh god they did do damage oh yeah

552.959 --> 558.64
uh haram is stand stone hello

556.16 --> 560.48
are you wrong in saying glow buster's

558.64 --> 564.0
bob believes in gravity

560.48 --> 565.839
no you're perfectly fine yes he is that

564.0 --> 569.36
dumb

565.839 --> 572.399
he is a double downing reifying

569.36 --> 574.24
fantasist when it comes to that he is

572.399 --> 576.48
one of these people that is convinced

574.24 --> 578.8
that he can find

576.48 --> 580.8000000000001
gravity just like all the other

578.8 --> 584.8
delusional science fiction

580.8 --> 587.92
people out there that pursue

584.8 --> 590.0799999999999
what gravity really is

587.92 --> 591.68
and in a way i used to be one of them up

590.08 --> 592.9590000000001
to a few years ago

591.68 --> 594.3199999999999
because i thought it was interesting

592.959 --> 595.5999999999999
it's like yeah but it has to be

594.32 --> 596.48
something right it has to be something

595.6 --> 598.5600000000001
yeah yeah

596.48 --> 600.16
it's called relative density and that's

598.56 --> 604.56
it well it's not enough

600.16 --> 606.16
it's not enough or too [ __ ] bad baby

604.56 --> 608.56
boo boo

606.16 --> 611.279
because it it's what it is it's

608.56 --> 614.079
scientifically provable

611.279 --> 616.079
and that's it that's what you got

614.079 --> 619.04
scientific proof that's

616.079 --> 619.92
that's the final thing that's where it

619.04 --> 622.64
ends that's

619.92 --> 624.24
where physics ends with scientific proof

622.64 --> 626.8
then you got it

624.24 --> 627.44
and that's it and now the philosophy in

626.8 --> 630.959
the world

627.44 --> 634.6400000000001
is not going to help you progress

630.959 --> 636.88
finding something better right

634.64 --> 637.76
because that is what it is it's relative

636.88 --> 640.64
density

637.76 --> 641.68
and that's it and there's just nothing

640.64 --> 646.0
more to

641.68 --> 647.8389999999999
do about it and well there's a whole

646.0 --> 650.8
category of people out there that just

647.839 --> 650.8000000000001
cannot accept that

652.399 --> 656.72
but anyway that's not what all the

653.839 --> 656.72
hassle is about

658.16 --> 662.24
i really don't give a [ __ ] if bob wants

660.16 --> 663.1999999999999
to believe in gravity or not i literally

662.24 --> 665.279
don't care

663.2 --> 668.32
let him fantasize about it every

665.279 --> 671.12
freaking day for hours i don't care

668.32 --> 673.12
i literally don't that's not what i got

671.12 --> 675.279
issues with

673.12 --> 676.24
you know there are other people that

675.279 --> 678.079
have serious issues

676.24 --> 679.6800000000001
that i don't even have real issues with

678.079 --> 683.279
that i just think it's really dumb

679.68 --> 685.76
that's it you know but yeah oh my god

683.279 --> 688.959
somebody out there does something really

685.76 --> 691.36
dumb oh my god stop the presses

688.959 --> 692.64
yeah yeah yeah everybody's freaking

691.36 --> 696.5600000000001
[ __ ] out there so

692.64 --> 696.56
who gives a [ __ ] you know

700.88 --> 705.92
yeah my old fed gravity theories

704.0 --> 707.279
well the the theories are still there

705.92 --> 710.959
like conceptually

707.279 --> 710.959
i was taught i was dead on

711.6 --> 716.5600000000001
it's just that i was not fully in

714.32 --> 718.5600000000001
understanding of

716.56 --> 720.56
like the nature and the origins of the

718.56 --> 730.88
elements involved with physics

720.56 --> 736.6389999999999
i just didn't get it

730.88 --> 736.639
oh yeah that came out of nowhere

741.76 --> 750.24
the good old 700-ish

746.48 --> 754.639
wow 500 episodes ago

750.24 --> 759.839
right anyway i had a pretty busy

754.639 --> 759.839
day yesterday in video land

760.48 --> 764.88
flat earth debates was good but freaking

763.839 --> 767.519
annoying

764.88 --> 768.079
because my sound was just [ __ ] around

767.519 --> 769.92
with me

768.079 --> 771.3599999999999
i don't understand why it was so

769.92 --> 774.639
annoying

771.36 --> 777.279
like i was so soft but then also people

774.639 --> 778.16
just started to ignore me because i was

777.279 --> 781.6
soft that

778.16 --> 784.24
really pissed me off

781.6 --> 786.16
but eventually it was restored and i

784.24 --> 789.36
hope it stays that way because that's

786.16 --> 790.48
just [ __ ] annoying it made no sense i

789.36 --> 793.839
did not change

790.48 --> 796.0
anything i have not changed anything

793.839 --> 797.2790000000001
and just for no damn reason when i

796.0 --> 801.279
plugged in there

797.279 --> 804.56
it was just 10 sound or something it's

801.279 --> 808.079
like [ __ ] you google drive

804.56 --> 811.92
[ __ ] you stop [ __ ] around with me

808.079 --> 814.399
why don't you get things normal

811.92 --> 814.959
and then keep it that way why do you

814.399 --> 819.12
have to

814.959 --> 822.2399999999999
[ __ ] around with everything constantly

819.12 --> 824.639
just you like this whole

822.24 --> 826.0790000000001
[ __ ] programming system you know it's

824.639 --> 829.04
supposed to be advanced

826.079 --> 831.92
then why does it look like it's all made

829.04 --> 835.88
by a bunch of handicapped people

831.92 --> 838.24
why can't it just be

835.88 --> 840.48
consistent

838.24 --> 842.16
why does it have to [ __ ] around and

840.48 --> 845.1990000000001
wobble around for no

842.16 --> 846.8
damn reason like even afterwards we

845.199 --> 850.079
don't even find out

846.8 --> 853.279
why it just randomly did what the

850.079 --> 856.7199999999999
[ __ ] is up with this

853.279 --> 857.36
what the [ __ ] is that why can't it just

856.72 --> 860.399
be

857.36 --> 864.0790000000001
normal persistent all

860.399 --> 867.279
the time it's so

864.079 --> 870.6389999999999
[ __ ] annoying google fix

867.279 --> 874.72
your damn programs

870.639 --> 874.72
is what you are fix

882.839 --> 885.839
them

887.56 --> 890.9699999999999
[Music]

893.92 --> 897.3299999999999
[Music]

900.959 --> 906.2399999999999
right uh yeah other than that

904.24 --> 907.36
i was owned benjamin's life i caught him

906.24 --> 912.72
live pretty quick

907.36 --> 914.8000000000001
it was kick-ass it was just kick-ass

912.72 --> 916.9590000000001
i really feel like one of the bears now

914.8 --> 920.399
i don't have a bear name

916.959 --> 924.7199999999999
i i'm thinking about

920.399 --> 924.72
i have been thinking about bear names

924.839 --> 930.32
but

926.56 --> 931.7589999999999
i just yeah the thing is if i take on a

930.32 --> 937.0400000000001
bear name

931.759 --> 939.759
that feels like i would put on a costume

937.04 --> 941.279
and then if they would be like oh yeah

939.759 --> 942.9590000000001
finally as you are

941.279 --> 945.12
well that's never going to be it because

942.959 --> 948.6389999999999
i will always

945.12 --> 950.72
always be our win

948.639 --> 952.88
or are we in the wizard or are in the

950.72 --> 956.24
foul mouth wizard or

952.88 --> 958.959
are wendy the rambling maniac

956.24 --> 959.44
whatever but i will always be arwin

958.959 --> 962.6389999999999
that's

959.44 --> 965.759
the primary name right

962.639 --> 967.759
so to be a bear of some kind i would

965.759 --> 969.92
love to adapt especially if owen

967.759 --> 972.5600000000001
benjamin would actually start calling my

969.92 --> 974.639
name because he reads out

972.56 --> 976.399
yeah plenty of my sentences that i type

974.639 --> 979.92
out because i crush

976.399 --> 980.88
because i crush i know what the [ __ ] i'm

979.92 --> 984.16
saying

980.88 --> 985.6
i'm a word smith i crush i'm good at

984.16 --> 987.6
what i do

985.6 --> 989.279
it's my [ __ ] life i know what i

987.6 --> 991.1990000000001
[ __ ] say

989.279 --> 992.72
and when i listen in to owen benjamin

991.199 --> 995.3599999999999
and hear him say things

992.72 --> 996.0790000000001
then i literally take the whole scoop of

995.36 --> 999.36
what's going

996.079 --> 1000.399
on and then condense it all down to just

999.36 --> 1003.36
a few words

1000.399 --> 1004.959
and i'm a master at it and i'm not gonna

1003.36 --> 1008.72
be modest about that either

1004.959 --> 1010.7199999999999
i am a master of that and he knows it

1008.72 --> 1011.9200000000001
and that's why he reads out plenty of my

1010.72 --> 1014.1600000000001
sentences

1011.92 --> 1015.5999999999999
the ones that are actually suitable for

1014.16 --> 1016.48
reading out because some of them are

1015.6 --> 1019.6800000000001
just

1016.48 --> 1022.24
complex wizard puzzles just for him to

1019.68 --> 1023.7589999999999
receive and that's all because if he

1022.24 --> 1025.439
would read it out people wouldn't get it

1023.759 --> 1028.72
either so

1025.439 --> 1032.16
right but i've thought about like

1028.72 --> 1037.919
bear names like

1032.16 --> 1040.4
maybe like foul-mouthed arwinian bear

1037.919 --> 1040.4
something

1041.039 --> 1049.28
because i am i want to be i want

1044.48 --> 1049.28
it to be known that i am foul-mouthed

1049.6 --> 1054.0
i want it to be known i want it to be

1052.48 --> 1054.48
known that people look at me and think

1054.0 --> 1057.039
oh

1054.48 --> 1059.28
cool but that they realize that if they

1057.039 --> 1059.76
say something shitty to me i'm going to

1059.28 --> 1063.28
[ __ ]

1059.76 --> 1065.36
explode on them verbally

1063.28 --> 1067.28
and and use pretty disgusting words all

1065.36 --> 1068.6399999999999
of a sudden when i normally talk very

1067.28 --> 1071.44
politely

1068.64 --> 1073.3600000000001
you know i want it to be known if you

1071.44 --> 1076.559
[ __ ] around with me i'm going to

1073.36 --> 1078.9599999999998
curse on you like a dog worker

1076.559 --> 1080.48
and that is what i am and that is what i

1078.96 --> 1082.4
really am inside

1080.48 --> 1083.679
and it's been very tough having to

1082.4 --> 1086.88
suppress that

1083.679 --> 1089.679
for a long time it

1086.88 --> 1090.88
is actually has been so tough on me so

1089.679 --> 1094.16
tough

1090.88 --> 1097.2
that i had psychological side effects

1094.16 --> 1097.8400000000001
that are kind of comparable to what did

1097.2 --> 1100.96
i

1097.84 --> 1104.32
i talked about it yesterday uh

1100.96 --> 1107.8400000000001
to tourette's where i will literally

1104.32 --> 1109.76
out of the critical mass critical mass

1107.84 --> 1111.28
of a conjunction of stress will just

1109.76 --> 1115.919
start to out of nowhere

1111.28 --> 1119.9189999999999
start cursing full lungs like [ __ ]

1115.919 --> 1123.2
die die just i had that [ __ ]

1119.919 --> 1125.1200000000001
i've been having that for two years i've

1123.2 --> 1128.0
reported out on it

1125.12 --> 1129.36
it's like i had that because i was

1128.0 --> 1132.96
constantly

1129.36 --> 1134.32
suppressing it constantly constantly you

1132.96 --> 1137.76
know this guys

1134.32 --> 1141.2
i've been constantly suppressing this

1137.76 --> 1142.48
trait of myself to try to look a little

1141.2 --> 1147.039
bit more reasonable

1142.48 --> 1151.1200000000001
to to see more tolerant

1147.039 --> 1153.679
it's not healthy for me i get tourette's

1151.12 --> 1154.7199999999998
suppressing that [ __ ] and since i've

1153.679 --> 1158.0800000000002
stopped doing that

1154.72 --> 1161.76
a week ago i no longer have that

1158.08 --> 1164.3999999999999
not a second i have not had a outburst

1161.76 --> 1167.44
of yelling and screaming

1164.4 --> 1170.96
since i got better but

1167.44 --> 1176.3200000000002
i am freaking falmouth now

1170.96 --> 1176.32
and ravenous and merciless

1176.48 --> 1181.76
and because i can be i am back to normal

1183.12 --> 1186.6399999999999
paladin bear i love that

1187.84 --> 1194.1599999999999
i like that although i don't know if i'm

1190.72 --> 1194.16
actually worthy of that title

1195.039 --> 1201.28
like to be a paladin is one thing but to

1197.6 --> 1204.48
be a paladin among bears

1201.28 --> 1207.84
i don't think i'm worthy of that

1204.48 --> 1207.84
you know

1208.96 --> 1214.96
i'd maybe i think then wizard bear would

1212.0 --> 1214.96
probably be better

1219.6 --> 1224.48
but maybe yeah maybe something like foul

1221.6 --> 1224.48
mouth wizard bear

1232.84 --> 1235.84
something

1238.799 --> 1242.559
that's kind of funny i'll make a note of

1240.96 --> 1249.8400000000001
that arwyn

1242.559 --> 1249.84
the foul mouth wizard bear

1261.57 --> 1264.76
[Music]

1268.559 --> 1273.52
it sounds like a really funny kid book

1270.799 --> 1277.84
story doesn't it

1273.52 --> 1277.84
our windfall mouse wizard bear

1280.32 --> 1286.559
like this the story book is almost

1283.52 --> 1287.28
in my mind writing itself just like the

1286.559 --> 1290.26
title

1287.28 --> 1294.69
just makes it exists

1290.26 --> 1294.69
[Laughter]

1295.52 --> 1298.559
it's such a relief just to be able to be

1297.919 --> 1302.5590000000002
myself

1298.559 --> 1307.039
just like that not be afraid

1302.559 --> 1307.039
not be afraid of what i enjoy

1307.28 --> 1314.48
silly weird little enjoyments

1310.4 --> 1315.52
like i enjoy being slightly intimidating

1314.48 --> 1320.32
to fools

1315.52 --> 1323.12
i enjoy it it's it's not sadism

1320.32 --> 1324.6399999999999
i think because if they genuinely hurt

1323.12 --> 1327.039
then i don't like it

1324.64 --> 1329.44
you know but i like if they're being a

1327.039 --> 1329.44
little like

1329.52 --> 1334.0
i like that i like it but i don't like

1333.039 --> 1335.919
it if they're like no

1334.0 --> 1338.0
please don't hurt me no then i'll be

1335.919 --> 1339.8400000000001
like i'm sorry i'm sorry

1338.0 --> 1341.28
that i didn't mean it like that please

1339.84 --> 1344.3999999999999
let me help you

1341.28 --> 1347.76
i i will go on my knees

1344.4 --> 1350.159
if that makes them feel better i don't

1347.76 --> 1351.44
genuinely want somebody to really be

1350.159 --> 1353.679
hurt i hate i

1351.44 --> 1355.6000000000001
think that's horrific but i like it if

1353.679 --> 1358.0800000000002
they're just a little

1355.6 --> 1359.4399999999998
a little impressed on an intuitive level

1358.08 --> 1362.08
i like that

1359.44 --> 1363.8400000000001
i get joy from that it makes me feel

1362.08 --> 1367.039
like yes

1363.84 --> 1371.12
i'm real i'm not just

1367.039 --> 1373.52
pretending to be this i got the power i

1371.12 --> 1375.1999999999998
got the energy it's radiating off me and

1373.52 --> 1377.9189999999999
it has a response on people

1375.2 --> 1377.919
i like that

1379.919 --> 1387.2
hey cameron gilmore tiny wombo

1383.52 --> 1390.0
the lady lacey show ah

1387.2 --> 1390.0
israelites

1392.24 --> 1395.76
yes indeed

1398.159 --> 1404.64
whiz win is the next level

1401.52 --> 1407.2
now now winds there's no winds

1404.64 --> 1408.0800000000002
in this level tier it's just our win our

1407.2 --> 1413.039
win

1408.08 --> 1413.039
is my my archaic name

1414.64 --> 1419.6000000000001
irwin is the name of my spirit

1417.36 --> 1422.08
throughout all my incarnations

1419.6 --> 1423.6789999999999
and maybe after i'm gone there will be

1422.08 --> 1426.1589999999999
another arwyn

1423.679 --> 1427.279
and you will know you will know when it

1426.159 --> 1430.24
is an arwyn

1427.279 --> 1432.0
or when it is just another person you

1430.24 --> 1435.36
will know

1432.0 --> 1438.24
you will know by the essence of them

1435.36 --> 1439.84
but as long as i live there is only one

1438.24 --> 1444.4
arwyn

1439.84 --> 1446.8799999999999
can only be by god's decree

1444.4 --> 1448.4
yeah sounds very mysterious doesn't it

1446.88 --> 1451.0390000000002
but you will know

1448.4 --> 1453.8400000000001
that what i say right now is true as

1451.039 --> 1453.84
time passes

1454.159 --> 1459.8400000000001
because there can only be one of what i

1456.559 --> 1459.84
am at the same time

1462.32 --> 1469.279
are you my armenians no

1466.64 --> 1469.279
not really

1471.12 --> 1477.279
there's no arwenians there's just people

1474.559 --> 1477.279
that follow me

1484.559 --> 1489.36
i don't know i'd call you my flock but

1487.76 --> 1491.6
that would suggest that you would be

1489.36 --> 1494.9599999999998
sheep and i don't want to

1491.6 --> 1494.9599999999998
degrade you like that

1495.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
so as far as i'm concerned you're just

1497.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
my followers

1502.72 --> 1506.0
do i ever hang with other flat friends

1504.88 --> 1509.5200000000002
in real life no

1506.0 --> 1512.72
no i don't i don't have any flat friends

1509.52 --> 1515.12
here in the netherlands in physical

1512.72 --> 1516.32
in physical presence there there was one

1515.12 --> 1520.9599999999998
guy though

1516.32 --> 1522.799
the hope who lived in the same city

1520.96 --> 1525.44
and i have hung out with him he's

1522.799 --> 1529.2
awesome oh what an awesome guy that is

1525.44 --> 1531.1200000000001
oh such spirit such good spirits

1529.2 --> 1532.64
but unfortunately he moved to the east

1531.12 --> 1534.7199999999998
of the country

1532.64 --> 1538.96
so yeah there's no more opportunity for

1534.72 --> 1538.96
me to just see him just like that

1540.88 --> 1545.2
and i know two other flat earthers here

1544.32 --> 1547.52
in the netherlands

1545.2 --> 1549.3600000000001
and i can talk to them over discord they

1547.52 --> 1551.84
live in amsterdam

1549.36 --> 1553.279
so but right around the in this

1551.84 --> 1556.24
neighborhood or anything no there's

1553.279 --> 1558.24
nobody i know that's a flat earther

1556.24 --> 1560.88
or that's a flat earther that that would

1558.24 --> 1561.2
be worthy enough to talk with me without

1560.88 --> 1564.5590000000002
just

1561.2 --> 1564.559
[ __ ] your pants or something

1566.4 --> 1571.8400000000001
hey robin stanley

1577.44 --> 1584.24
clover circular reasoning bear this is

1581.039 --> 1586.24
no it's way too long

1584.24 --> 1587.76
a bear name should not be longer than

1586.24 --> 1589.36
three words

1587.76 --> 1592.1589999999999
otherwise it's just going to be super

1589.36 --> 1592.1589999999999
convoluted

1597.76 --> 1604.809
i think foul mouth wizard bear is good

1601.66 --> 1604.809
[Music]

1610.84 --> 1613.84
enough

1615.89 --> 1619.999
[Music]

1620.08 --> 1622.559
like that

1624.0 --> 1628.48
three words and a connecting word and

1626.88 --> 1641.8400000000001
that's a good time that's a good bear

1628.48 --> 1641.84
name i think

1647.679 --> 1652.0
or maybe you should just call it like

1650.0 --> 1653.84
knife tongued

1652.0 --> 1655.76
i don't want to be fork tongue of course

1653.84 --> 1659.12
because that's obviously

1655.76 --> 1660.72
like a symbol for lying but i am a ninth

1659.12 --> 1663.52
tongue

1660.72 --> 1663.919
my tongue is freaking sharp as [ __ ]

1663.52 --> 1669.6
it'll

1663.919 --> 1672.0
slit your throat

1669.6 --> 1674.559
but yeah that's a weird saying like a

1672.0 --> 1674.559
knife tongue

1679.279 --> 1683.84
i win the knife tongued wizard bear

1684.08 --> 1691.36
or our win knife tongue wizard bear

1688.32 --> 1697.84
oh razor razor tongue yeah yeah i like

1691.36 --> 1697.84
that i like that

1699.36 --> 1704.6399999999999
[Music]

1701.039 --> 1706.799
i really like that that's a really good

1704.64 --> 1706.7990000000002
one

1713.44 --> 1717.039
also because it basically i'm not always

1715.84 --> 1719.6789999999999
that foul mouth

1717.039 --> 1719.679
i like that

1720.72 --> 1724.88
i'm gonna make another note of that

1722.72 --> 1726.77
because i think that maybe

1724.88 --> 1729.0390000000002
i'm going to just adapt my

1726.77 --> 1733.279
[Music]

1729.039 --> 1734.08
my d live account to just become a pure

1733.279 --> 1735.84
bear

1734.08 --> 1737.6
account because i don't think i'm really

1735.84 --> 1739.6
going to transit the stream there

1737.6 --> 1742.8799999999999
anymore

1739.6 --> 1742.8799999999999
it's too much of a hassle

1751.52 --> 1755.279
i like that harwin razor tongue wizard

1754.799 --> 1760.48
bear

1755.279 --> 1760.48
i like that a lot rolls off the tongue

1762.96 --> 1766.08
right so yeah that happened owen

1765.52 --> 1768.8799999999999
benjamin

1766.08 --> 1768.8799999999999
was pretty awesome

1769.36 --> 1776.7199999999998
good just good stuff good videos

1773.52 --> 1777.52
him sharing about his goats those goats

1776.72 --> 1780.08
are just amazing

1777.52 --> 1780.72
like they love it so much his his

1780.08 --> 1784.559
animals

1780.72 --> 1787.2
love that [ __ ] love their life so much

1784.559 --> 1787.9189999999999
that they'd literally do everything

1787.2 --> 1790.3990000000001
fallen like

1787.919 --> 1791.6000000000001
these goats like they're so eager to

1790.399 --> 1794.8799999999999
like get milked

1791.6 --> 1797.12
they'll just do it just run up there

1794.88 --> 1800.48
get right away in the spot they need to

1797.12 --> 1803.6789999999999
be so that big bear can milk them

1800.48 --> 1808.88
just no hesitation what like that's

1803.679 --> 1811.76
yeah it's an amazing sight

1808.88 --> 1812.0800000000002
but also yeah pretty stark realization

1811.76 --> 1815.84
that

1812.08 --> 1819.279
what he shared like yeah if he just like

1815.84 --> 1823.12
if he's missing for like one day

1819.279 --> 1825.76
they could all die it's pretty shocking

1823.12 --> 1827.9189999999999
pretty stark realization that yeah it is

1825.76 --> 1829.52
absolutely closed loop now like he

1827.919 --> 1832.0
cannot go away there

1829.52 --> 1832.0
like that

1834.96 --> 1838.159
so i don't know if i'll ever be like

1837.76 --> 1841.279
that

1838.159 --> 1844.72
maybe if i did really have a family

1841.279 --> 1848.0
around me too then i i'd settle to be

1844.72 --> 1850.96
in such a closed loop myself but

1848.0 --> 1851.44
as long as i don't i i would never be

1850.96 --> 1854.64
caught

1851.44 --> 1856.3990000000001
in such a tight loop just on my own with

1854.64 --> 1857.679
my goats or something that that seems

1856.399 --> 1859.6789999999999
like a nightmare to me

1857.679 --> 1861.44
but if i'd had a family and kids around

1859.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
me yes yes

1861.44 --> 1865.8400000000001
then it would be worth it

1866.799 --> 1873.9189999999999
right also much later in the evening

1869.919 --> 1876.72
there was rodrigo ferrari nunez

1873.919 --> 1877.519
at a very long stream and i sat with

1876.72 --> 1880.72
that

1877.519 --> 1883.039
since the startup for three hours pretty

1880.72 --> 1883.039
awesome

1884.96 --> 1893.44
good stream very

1888.799 --> 1895.519
very informative and amusing

1893.44 --> 1897.519
and then after three hours suddenly the

1895.519 --> 1901.2
ogres came rolling in

1897.519 --> 1901.2
literally it's guys

1901.36 --> 1905.279
bob is a [ __ ] cave troll he is he's a

1904.399 --> 1907.4399999999998
cave troll

1905.279 --> 1908.559
that's what it is and he just came

1907.44 --> 1911.039
rolling in

1908.559 --> 1912.24
expecting everybody to give him praise

1911.039 --> 1915.44
just literally

1912.24 --> 1919.679
after three hours just came watching in

1915.44 --> 1923.6000000000001
with his wife hello i'm here oh

1919.679 --> 1926.24
i'm so cool and then i just said

1923.6 --> 1928.1589999999999
okay after what he did this morning

1926.24 --> 1930.32
right he knew i was in there just came

1928.159 --> 1933.519
marching in like that expecting

1930.32 --> 1936.8799999999999
everybody to [ __ ] love him

1933.519 --> 1939.919
psychopath disgusting

1936.88 --> 1942.0
cave troll that he is

1939.919 --> 1944.0
didn't respond to him of course because

1942.0 --> 1947.279
yeah he literally told me to kill

1944.0 --> 1947.84
myself that morning this is not even

1947.279 --> 1950.399
like 10

1947.84 --> 1951.1999999999998
hours ago the guy is [ __ ] out of his

1950.399 --> 1954.7199999999998
mind

1951.2 --> 1956.96
right so i just said okay yeah

1954.72 --> 1958.64
told rodrigo yeah that's a great stream

1956.96 --> 1959.519
i'm gonna go to bed because it was three

1958.64 --> 1962.24
o'clock

1959.519 --> 1963.519
and at night anyway and then he rounded

1962.24 --> 1967.279
out the stream

1963.519 --> 1968.159
so yeah bye nobody gives a [ __ ] about

1967.279 --> 1971.279
your presence

1968.159 --> 1974.3990000000001
bob your [ __ ] cave troll

1971.279 --> 1975.76
demanding tribute at your presence [ __ ]

1974.399 --> 1981.36
you buddy

1975.76 --> 1981.36
nobody wants you you're a cave troll

1981.919 --> 1987.679
you stink you're luggishly big

1985.679 --> 1992.48
and you have nothing to contribute

1987.679 --> 1992.48
except crushing people under your feet

1996.799 --> 2000.24
rodrigo need to get back to that bike

1998.799 --> 2002.32
video yeah yeah but

2000.24 --> 2004.0
look robin stanley the weather kind of

2002.32 --> 2005.76
sucks out there so i

2004.0 --> 2007.519
it's not surprising that he's not doing

2005.76 --> 2010.64
that currently because it's

2007.519 --> 2012.799
dutch winter and it's not a great

2010.64 --> 2015.6000000000001
great thing to stream outside it's not

2012.799 --> 2017.279
very inspiring so

2015.6 --> 2018.08
he'll probably start doing that again

2017.279 --> 2019.279
somewhere in

2018.08 --> 2022.559
[Music]

2019.279 --> 2024.88
i don't know february maybe

2022.559 --> 2026.48
march depends on when the weather is

2024.88 --> 2028.3200000000002
going to pick back up maybe if there's

2026.48 --> 2033.84
like a beautiful snow day you'll do it

2028.32 --> 2033.84
again that would be pretty cool

2036.48 --> 2041.6
yeah what did bob go and watch

2038.48 --> 2041.6
yesterday's stream

2045.36 --> 2048.7999999999997
i'm not going to repeat everything all

2048.0 --> 2051.52
the time

2048.8 --> 2052.8790000000004
because somebody wasn't present if you

2051.52 --> 2055.52
want to know what's going on

2052.879 --> 2055.919
then watch my streams i have it every

2055.52 --> 2059.04
day

2055.919 --> 2061.44
things happen you can watch it afterward

2059.04 --> 2064.32
you don't have to be there alive to keep

2061.44 --> 2064.32
track of what i do

2073.679 --> 2077.76
oh well he also told me

2079.28 --> 2082.7200000000003
he also told me let me

2084.399 --> 2091.52
let me just get back i took a screenshot

2088.159 --> 2091.52
so i can literally

2092.159 --> 2098.2400000000002
the [ __ ] right

2095.359 --> 2099.2
so i can read it out yeah this is what

2098.24 --> 2101.5989999999997
he said

2099.2 --> 2102.72
one of the last times in their chat look

2101.599 --> 2106.1600000000003
at you arwen

2102.72 --> 2109.5989999999997
you live in a halfway house on welfare

2106.16 --> 2110.56
no friends no woman no money nothing to

2109.599 --> 2114.839
look forward to

2110.56 --> 2117.7599999999998
when you wake up just end it all

2114.839 --> 2120.56
quote that's what he said

2117.76 --> 2120.5600000000004
in my chat

2124.56 --> 2130.72
that's what he said if you're a part of

2128.079 --> 2133.8390000000004
my flat earth early bird chat

2130.72 --> 2136.72
then you can literally see that

2133.839 --> 2140.48
screenshot for yourself

2136.72 --> 2144.9599999999996
so if you haven't add me on skype add

2140.48 --> 2148.4
me on skype

2144.96 --> 2150.96
not to be part of the show

2148.4 --> 2152.96
but so that i can put you in my

2150.96 --> 2155.839
information group which is the flat

2152.96 --> 2159.04
earth early bird show skype group

2155.839 --> 2160.4
so you can literally check up on that

2159.04 --> 2163.119
data

2160.4 --> 2165.119
my skype is in the description box it's

2163.119 --> 2166.48
literally the first sentence of the

2165.119 --> 2169.44
description box

2166.48 --> 2169.44
you should know this

2169.68 --> 2173.2799999999997
it's the first sentence in the

2171.839 --> 2177.52
description box

2173.28 --> 2179.599
the first sentence it's right there

2177.52 --> 2182.24
there is no way that it could ever be

2179.599 --> 2184.079
concealed

2182.24 --> 2187.839
it's always visible it's the first

2184.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
sentence you see

2197.04 --> 2202.4
right well maybe you should do

2200.079 --> 2206.8
some personal investigations before you

2202.4 --> 2206.8
just throw a question out directly to me

2207.839 --> 2211.44
that's all not mad at you just like come

2210.64 --> 2214.64
on

2211.44 --> 2215.92
it's right there if you just take your

2214.64 --> 2218.56
eyes

2215.92 --> 2218.56
and look

2219.119 --> 2222.96
you don't always have to type in a

2220.88 --> 2223.92
question first before you use your other

2222.96 --> 2229.839
sentences

2223.92 --> 2229.839
your other senses you know

2241.44 --> 2248.32
yes yes he did here we go again i

2244.72 --> 2251.2
i did not even remember that

2248.32 --> 2252.4
that atrocious part where he actually

2251.2 --> 2255.4399999999996
justified it

2252.4 --> 2260.079
they actually had the gall to

2255.44 --> 2263.599
justify that and say yes it's okay

2260.079 --> 2264.4
yeah deserve to go to jail for that

2263.599 --> 2268.48
buddy

2264.4 --> 2270.32
it's condoning monstrous criminal action

2268.48 --> 2272.4
that's like saying like yeah i think

2270.32 --> 2275.2000000000003
it's okay that people can just

2272.4 --> 2277.04
murder somebody else because they feel

2275.2 --> 2282.0
like it

2277.04 --> 2282.0
and not because of some grievous

2282.839 --> 2285.839
injustice

2286.48 --> 2291.8
yeah that's literally just promoting and

2290.079 --> 2296.079
condoning of

2291.8 --> 2298.3
egregious criminal action

2296.079 --> 2299.6800000000003
should go to jail for that

2298.3 --> 2302.48
[Music]

2299.68 --> 2304.3999999999996
and maybe one day he will i will

2302.48 --> 2307.76
definitely keep on

2304.4 --> 2308.48
shoving it in people's face until

2307.76 --> 2312.2400000000002
somebody

2308.48 --> 2316.88
does make work of that bubby boy

2312.24 --> 2316.8799999999997
unapologetic criminal condoner

2318.0 --> 2327.67
[Music]

2320.0 --> 2330.78
cave troll

2327.67 --> 2330.78
[Music]

2343.72 --> 2348.0789999999997
anti-semitism doesn't even mean anything

2348.8 --> 2352.0
but but it is supposedly like saying oh

2351.04 --> 2355.2799999999997
this is not

2352.0 --> 2356.079
worthy versus something else but that's

2355.28 --> 2359.119
not even it

2356.079 --> 2362.1600000000003
you know that's that's like annoying

2359.119 --> 2366.0
it's not good to say like this people is

2362.16 --> 2368.64
bad us people is good

2366.0 --> 2369.599
that's just stupid it's lame it's

2368.64 --> 2373.16
against god's

2369.599 --> 2375.3590000000004
law it's not jesus

2373.16 --> 2376.3999999999996
specifically taught against that

2375.359 --> 2380.3199999999997
specifically

2376.4 --> 2382.56
above all other things right that's just

2380.32 --> 2384.7200000000003
but it's a problem it's what humans tend

2382.56 --> 2387.599
to do it's the pharisee nature

2384.72 --> 2389.52
unfortunately that's something else as

2387.599 --> 2393.44
just saying

2389.52 --> 2396.64
no i think that the commandments

2393.44 --> 2398.16
the original commandments are wrong and

2396.64 --> 2401.2799999999997
this

2398.16 --> 2405.68
should just be allowed

2401.28 --> 2409.599
now that that is a violation

2405.68 --> 2412.72
a big one that's way

2409.599 --> 2415.92
way worse than any form of racism

2412.72 --> 2416.9599999999996
or discrimination against a group it's

2415.92 --> 2420.16
literally just

2416.96 --> 2425.839
defying god's law himself

2420.16 --> 2425.839
it's absolutely atrocious

2426.64 --> 2429.73
[Music]

2432.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
yeah i know i know

2440.0 --> 2443.92
all right

2441.46 --> 2447.28
[Music]

2443.92 --> 2449.28
guys guys

2447.28 --> 2451.2000000000003
you know people can say some crazy

2449.28 --> 2452.079
things you know and then they come to a

2451.2 --> 2454.8799999999997
realization

2452.079 --> 2456.6400000000003
like wait maybe maybe i overstepped my

2454.88 --> 2457.599
boundaries a little maybe i took it a

2456.64 --> 2461.44
little too far

2457.599 --> 2464.2400000000002
i i got really liberal i wanted to

2461.44 --> 2465.599
continue the train of thought to its

2464.24 --> 2467.7599999999998
conclusion

2465.599 --> 2469.839
right and then they afterwards say like

2467.76 --> 2470.96
yeah sorry guys i might have stepped a

2469.839 --> 2475.52
little bit too far

2470.96 --> 2475.52
yeah yeah yeah bob

2475.599 --> 2482.48
never apologized

2478.72 --> 2485.5989999999997
or retracted any fragment

2482.48 --> 2490.8
of what he had said in that video

2485.599 --> 2494.6400000000003
since then not even a hint

2490.8 --> 2497.92
you understand not even a hint

2494.64 --> 2501.1189999999997
of a retraction or any kind of moral

2497.92 --> 2504.96
sense about it no he stands

2501.119 --> 2509.119
behind what he said and that makes him

2504.96 --> 2513.2
a full-blown psychopath

2509.119 --> 2515.28
it's not just me trying to slander him

2513.2 --> 2516.0
because i don't like him i don't like

2515.28 --> 2519.3590000000004
bob

2516.0 --> 2523.44
no no that's real what i'm saying

2519.359 --> 2526.48
is real he is a psychopath

2523.44 --> 2529.52
guys a real one

2526.48 --> 2533.44
not not just a [ __ ] movie psycho

2529.52 --> 2536.96
a real psychopath

2533.44 --> 2538.64
you understand provably so you can take

2536.96 --> 2542.7200000000003
this information

2538.64 --> 2548.16
go to a psychologist let them analyze it

2542.72 --> 2553.04
and they will concur with my conclusion

2548.16 --> 2556.48
you understand try it out

2553.04 --> 2560.48
be aware this guy

2556.48 --> 2564.079
will maneuver in your life

2560.48 --> 2565.119
like he's normal because he thinks he is

2564.079 --> 2568.4
normal

2565.119 --> 2572.2400000000002
and he thinks that other people follow

2568.4 --> 2578.2400000000002
a rigid moral code that's unnecessary

2572.24 --> 2581.1189999999997
because he is a psychopath

2578.24 --> 2582.56
you understand most psychopaths are

2581.119 --> 2586.1600000000003
intelligent enough

2582.56 --> 2588.7999999999997
to keep the veil over it over their

2586.16 --> 2590.96
moral derangement

2588.8 --> 2594.48
and never show it to anyone because they

2590.96 --> 2598.2400000000002
are smart enough to know

2594.48 --> 2601.359
that once people identify you with that

2598.24 --> 2604.319
they will keep away from you

2601.359 --> 2605.359
because you are dangerous and deranged

2604.319 --> 2608.64
and can literally

2605.359 --> 2612.16
psychologically damage people

2608.64 --> 2614.72
because of your moral derangement

2612.16 --> 2615.2
well bob is not intelligent enough for

2614.72 --> 2618.839
that

2615.2 --> 2620.0789999999997
he's a [ __ ] baby on top of being a

2618.839 --> 2623.119
psychopath

2620.079 --> 2626.079
so he just threw it out there

2623.119 --> 2628.319
like finally i can speak the truth i can

2626.079 --> 2631.4
just say it exactly how i think

2628.319 --> 2635.52
yeah well guess what you are a

2631.4 --> 2639.76
identified psychopath

2635.52 --> 2642.88
and i will not stand by and just let you

2639.76 --> 2642.88
walsh around

2643.04 --> 2648.72
and ruin people's lives

2646.319 --> 2650.4
like a cave troll marching in and

2648.72 --> 2653.1189999999997
crushing things

2650.4 --> 2653.119
you understand

2655.599 --> 2663.839
no he is stupid he is really

2658.72 --> 2663.839
[ __ ] stupid israelite

2665.76 --> 2673.3590000000004
he is stupid he might have some

2670.0 --> 2677.28
intellectual faculties available to him

2673.359 --> 2679.52
but he is really [ __ ] stupid

2677.28 --> 2681.44
or he would have never done any of these

2679.52 --> 2684.079
things

2681.44 --> 2685.44
and guys he's not like 20 years old you

2684.079 --> 2688.0
know when you're 20 years old you make

2685.44 --> 2690.64
some really stupid decisions sometimes

2688.0 --> 2692.48
with bravada you think i'm gonna change

2690.64 --> 2693.52
the [ __ ] world now the world is wrong

2692.48 --> 2696.96
[ __ ]

2693.52 --> 2700.8
i'm gonna do it no this guy

2696.96 --> 2704.2400000000002
is a white-haired old man

2700.8 --> 2719.8390000000004
there's no excuse it's [ __ ]

2704.24 --> 2719.839
stupid and deranged

2740.64 --> 2749.359
what tiny one what kind of quote is that

2747.839 --> 2751.7599999999998
all right anyway i'm done about that

2749.359 --> 2754.319
[ __ ] it's not work like

2751.76 --> 2756.0
it's how much how many think how many

2754.319 --> 2757.119
times can you talk about a freaking cave

2756.0 --> 2759.599
troll

2757.119 --> 2761.839
you know like even in lord of the rings

2759.599 --> 2763.76
it just had one combat scene it was

2761.839 --> 2765.2
pretty damn impressive

2763.76 --> 2767.92
but they took him down and then it's

2765.2 --> 2768.96
done it's just a bleeding big pile of

2767.92 --> 2771.44
flesh somebody

2768.96 --> 2772.079
somewhere and nobody gives a [ __ ]

2771.44 --> 2775.359
anymore

2772.079 --> 2777.44
because it's just a freaking cave troll

2775.359 --> 2778.72
and they're a real nuisance when you

2777.44 --> 2780.8
have to face them

2778.72 --> 2782.24
when they're dead it's just a heap of

2780.8 --> 2785.6800000000003
dead flesh

2782.24 --> 2787.52
so i don't want to spend

2785.68 --> 2791.44
the entire show just talking about

2787.52 --> 2791.44
freaking bob if you don't mind

2796.59 --> 2800.219
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
right

2807.14 --> 2810.25
[Music]

2814.839 --> 2819.44
what

2816.24 --> 2821.1189999999997
jim jones agm what what what what are

2819.44 --> 2824.079
you talking about

2821.119 --> 2826.0
agm is not a psychopath agm is just

2824.079 --> 2829.2000000000003
tragic figure

2826.0 --> 2830.24
that needs to commit himself to a mental

2829.2 --> 2832.7999999999997
health institute

2830.24 --> 2835.2799999999997
and that's not that's not being mean

2832.8 --> 2838.079
that's serious

2835.28 --> 2839.28
he needs to get help he's not an evil

2838.079 --> 2842.6400000000003
person he's just not

2839.28 --> 2845.599
in control of himself and he needs to

2842.64 --> 2848.72
get the [ __ ] out of my show because

2845.599 --> 2851.44
he can't respect me

2848.72 --> 2854.0
he just can't he's compulsive and he

2851.44 --> 2857.359
just needs to get some mental help

2854.0 --> 2860.4
that's it that's a really

2857.359 --> 2862.5589999999997
brutal comparison there

2860.4 --> 2866.1600000000003
because he's not a psychopath he's just

2862.559 --> 2866.1600000000003
not in control of himself okay

2871.359 --> 2875.68
but what about ranty i don't watch ranty

2874.0 --> 2878.079
i'm not subscribed to ranch i don't give

2875.68 --> 2882.48
a [ __ ] about what he does

2878.079 --> 2882.48
who why why what

2882.96 --> 2890.48
i owe him nothing nothing

2886.559 --> 2900.9300000000003
not a word not a glimpse

2890.48 --> 2904.35
with my eye why should i talk about him

2900.93 --> 2904.35
[Music]

2907.06 --> 2912.72
[Music]

2908.559 --> 2912.7200000000003
the only association i have with him

2912.839 --> 2916.48
he what

2917.52 --> 2929.839
gave his channel away what

2921.359 --> 2929.839
what the [ __ ] does that mean

2937.359 --> 2943.839
seriously what does that mean

2944.559 --> 2951.28
he's giving up his channel all right

2948.0 --> 2954.88
fine to brandon toy

2951.28 --> 2954.88
okay sure

2955.2 --> 2958.64
well i guess he's had enough then i

2957.2 --> 2962.64
guess it's time for him to

2958.64 --> 2966.0789999999997
[ __ ] off because probably some

2962.64 --> 2969.52
[ __ ] is going to be unearthed

2966.079 --> 2973.2000000000003
about what he's done because i know

2969.52 --> 2976.88
randy's done some really [ __ ] up [ __ ]

2973.2 --> 2977.359
i know it he's not told me but the way

2976.88 --> 2980.4
he's

2977.359 --> 2983.68
spoken with me

2980.4 --> 2986.1600000000003
revealed that some time ago

2983.68 --> 2988.8799999999997
that's why i also called him a

2986.16 --> 2988.8799999999997
psychopath

2988.96 --> 2992.8
when that happened without details

2992.24 --> 2996.72
because

2992.8 --> 2999.92
he told me that privately in trust

2996.72 --> 3000.72
and that trust is as valuable as god

2999.92 --> 3002.8
itself

3000.72 --> 3004.9599999999996
if you violate somebody's trust what

3002.8 --> 3008.0
they tell you in private

3004.96 --> 3011.28
then you are no better than a pharisee

3008.0 --> 3014.96
so but he is

3011.28 --> 3020.559
deranged so maybe he's just exiting

3014.96 --> 3020.559
because he knows [ __ ] is gonna go down

3020.88 --> 3025.6800000000003
because he's been involved with some

3022.72 --> 3029.1189999999997
really shaky people

3025.68 --> 3033.52
so really it's a real creeps

3029.119 --> 3033.52
real creeps the bad ones

3037.2 --> 3040.96
probably not too far off what what bob's

3040.16 --> 3044.96
been

3040.96 --> 3047.119
engaging with but i have no proof of

3044.96 --> 3047.119
that

3049.68 --> 3055.839
he's working with conspiracy cats what

3056.16 --> 3058.72
really

3065.63 --> 3069.839
[Music]

3066.839 --> 3069.839
okay

3070.48 --> 3075.04
that's hilarious man that's just funny

3079.2 --> 3083.359
okay that was kind of funny to know that

3081.359 --> 3086.7999999999997
thanks for informing me about that's so

3083.359 --> 3086.7999999999997
silly that's really funny

3089.599 --> 3097.3590000000004
but sure let him do whatever the [ __ ] he

3092.079 --> 3099.2000000000003
wants man

3097.359 --> 3101.2799999999997
it just goes to show he built this

3099.2 --> 3105.1189999999997
channel he built it

3101.28 --> 3110.079
pretty big and he's just giving it away

3105.119 --> 3113.599
what the what i guess he got bored

3110.079 --> 3124.2400000000002
he doesn't really care

3113.599 --> 3127.119
just bores him though i guess yeah

3124.24 --> 3127.68
okay matt hancock you go tell yourself

3127.119 --> 3130.7200000000003
that

3127.68 --> 3131.1189999999997
that's not something all people always

3130.72 --> 3134.24
say

3131.119 --> 3134.2400000000002
afterward right

3135.44 --> 3138.96
it's like one of the most typical things

3137.52 --> 3142.079
that people say

3138.96 --> 3152.4
after [ __ ] went down but that's fine

3142.079 --> 3154.8
that's fine just being human

3152.4 --> 3157.6800000000003
respect him oh well good you find your

3154.8 --> 3157.6800000000003
respect for that

3159.2 --> 3165.5989999999997
it's really nothing different you know

3162.64 --> 3166.64
giving away the channel and let it die

3165.599 --> 3168.8
let it die

3166.64 --> 3170.319
if you just discontinue doing things

3168.8 --> 3171.8390000000004
with it it's not gonna die

3170.319 --> 3173.44
everything that's there is still gonna

3171.839 --> 3175.2799999999997
sit there people are still gonna know

3173.44 --> 3178.96
about you

3175.28 --> 3178.96
so but fine

3179.04 --> 3182.24
it's just blatantly obvious he doesn't

3180.72 --> 3185.68
want to do it anymore

3182.24 --> 3186.24
so i don't know if he deserves respect

3185.68 --> 3189.359
for that

3186.24 --> 3191.359
for giving up but yeah it's his business

3189.359 --> 3195.839
you know he can do whatever the [ __ ] he

3191.359 --> 3195.839
wants to do it's his life

3197.76 --> 3200.88
i wanted to make some real one oh no

3199.599 --> 3205.44
doubt oh no

3200.88 --> 3205.44
oh no doubt

3207.68 --> 3216.64
he wants to be the next news anchor

3212.72 --> 3220.0789999999997
he wants to be british news

3216.64 --> 3221.839
tell you exactly how the state wants you

3220.079 --> 3224.079
to know

3221.839 --> 3226.72
oh i bet he'll do that he'd work for the

3224.079 --> 3230.079
bbc if he could

3226.72 --> 3230.0789999999997
because he doesn't give a [ __ ]

3231.33 --> 3235.04
[Music]

3233.119 --> 3237.11
yes hair down again amanda young i'm

3235.04 --> 3239.52
probably gonna do that permanently

3237.11 --> 3242.48
[Music]

3239.52 --> 3245.52
since i'm like showering a lot my hair

3242.48 --> 3245.52
is just so much better

3249.839 --> 3252.88
and it's kind of cold and when i have my

3251.76 --> 3256.2400000000002
hair loose like this

3252.88 --> 3259.359

3263.359 --> 3266.4
hey and i'm damn proud you know i'm 40.

3266.079 --> 3269.04
i'm

3266.4 --> 3270.96
40 and i got freaking hair i got long

3269.04 --> 3273.119
hair how many men can say

3270.96 --> 3274.2400000000002
that they have freaking hair like this

3273.119 --> 3278.2400000000002
when they're 40

3274.24 --> 3280.24
huh huh something to be proud of

3278.24 --> 3281.7599999999998
for no particular reason because it's

3280.24 --> 3285.2
not like i'd done something

3281.76 --> 3287.92
for it except just not give up on it

3285.2 --> 3289.52
but it's really thanks to god for giving

3287.92 --> 3292.7200000000003
me this body

3289.52 --> 3295.7599999999998
for designing it the way it is to be

3292.72 --> 3298.799
eventually combined into what i am

3295.76 --> 3299.5200000000004
now in my lifetime so i thank god's

3298.799 --> 3307.839
design

3299.52 --> 3307.839
for having this body

3308.559 --> 3321.2000000000003
get more hair over 60

3311.92 --> 3325.92
i don't know what you're talking about

3321.2 --> 3325.9199999999996
i have no gray hair none

3327.68 --> 3331.44
i did have like one singular gray hair

3330.64 --> 3334.48
at time

3331.44 --> 3336.559
like and but that's been there for like

3334.48 --> 3338.64
for over 10 years and that's it just one

3336.559 --> 3340.96
freaking gray hair

3338.64 --> 3349.839
but i don't see it anymore it's like

3340.96 --> 3349.839
it's not reappeared

3359.44 --> 3365.76
oh that's nice aries 106. that's

3362.799 --> 3365.7599999999998
it's very awesome

3371.2 --> 3377.839
your hair is almost my length

3388.559 --> 3392.559
right unfortunately i am very well aware

3390.799 --> 3393.68
it's not going to stay like this forever

3392.559 --> 3397.0400000000004
you know

3393.68 --> 3400.72
in 20 years i will probably be

3397.04 --> 3400.72
balding up there more

3401.359 --> 3409.52
like my dad has been losing hair

3404.799 --> 3412.88
you know but he's like almost 70

3409.52 --> 3418.0
now or maybe he is 70.

3412.88 --> 3421.119
damn i don't remember he's pretty old

3418.0 --> 3423.44
wait 24 no no no no no

3421.119 --> 3423.44
he's

3424.559 --> 3430.3190000000004
oh wait maybe he is 70 damn but

3428.4 --> 3432.0
yeah it's not gonna last forever i'm

3430.319 --> 3435.839
fine with that on the other

3432.0 --> 3436.24
hand i have supplement knowledge i have

3435.839 --> 3438.5589999999997
food

3436.24 --> 3441.68
knowledge i might be able to literally

3438.559 --> 3444.6400000000003
keep my hair up until my 80s

3441.68 --> 3447.1189999999997
so who knows maybe it is possible if i

3444.64 --> 3450.72
literally decide

3447.119 --> 3453.92
to keep it like that with my smarts

3450.72 --> 3454.799
with my focus i think that people can

3453.92 --> 3457.839
achieve

3454.799 --> 3460.72
longevity and youthfulness for

3457.839 --> 3463.52
much longer than the average person

3460.72 --> 3463.52
takes for granted

3464.64 --> 3471.839
so i'm betting on that really

3468.799 --> 3473.52
and well if it goes it goes and i'll

3471.839 --> 3476.48
just get a small hat

3473.52 --> 3479.04
to put on top of that they'll draw some

3476.48 --> 3479.04
other things

3483.28 --> 3493.65
a regular hat whatever

3488.2 --> 3493.6499999999996
[Music]

3496.16 --> 3500.48
most of your gray hair is caused by flat

3498.48 --> 3517.839
earthers this is

3500.48 --> 3517.839
sorry to hear that tiny one more

3528.839 --> 3532.88
hmm

3530.24 --> 3534.4799999999996
yeah not everyone he gets lucky right

3532.88 --> 3537.04
now thirteen

3534.48 --> 3537.52
i had a roommate yeah he's moved out

3537.04 --> 3541.52
since

3537.52 --> 3546.24
some time was a nurse he was like

3541.52 --> 3547.839
27 and he had like lots of gray hair

3546.24 --> 3550.5589999999997
he wasn't balding in any way though but

3547.839 --> 3555.04
he had like lots of gray hair

3550.559 --> 3556.6400000000003
and he was like 27. like what

3555.04 --> 3559.359
so i'm standing next to him and he's

3556.64 --> 3561.68
like yeah i look older than you

3559.359 --> 3563.839
and you're like more than 15 years older

3561.68 --> 3573.839
than me

3563.839 --> 3573.839
that's just weird

3578.88 --> 3584.2400000000002
entirely gray by age 13 damn

3584.4 --> 3589.2000000000003
damn that's crazy

3592.0 --> 3602.96
oh shut up mark taylor that's ridiculous

3609.92 --> 3615.839
you damn well know i'm 40.

3626.839 --> 3629.839
50ish

3640.839 --> 3646.409
so

3643.27 --> 3646.409
[Music]

3648.24 --> 3652.0
oh see you later mandy young getting old

3650.72 --> 3657.839
sucks no it doesn't

3652.0 --> 3657.839
it only sucks if you don't grow

3662.48 --> 3668.16
getting old is the best thing that could

3665.44 --> 3671.44
ever happen to you

3668.16 --> 3674.72
it means you survive and you get

3671.44 --> 3675.92
amazing faculties and opportunities

3674.72 --> 3679.1189999999997
available to you

3675.92 --> 3682.64
if you work for it

3679.119 --> 3683.359
if you realize that the same issues in

3682.64 --> 3685.68
your youth

3683.359 --> 3687.44
you know like oh i have to grow i have

3685.68 --> 3689.9199999999996
to be smart i have to learn how to

3687.44 --> 3692.319
socially deal with other people and

3689.92 --> 3695.359
then when i'm an adult i have to somehow

3692.319 --> 3698.96
be self-sufficient in society right

3695.359 --> 3700.319
well if you realize realize nobody will

3698.96 --> 3704.4
tell you this

3700.319 --> 3707.839
that this growing process never

3704.4 --> 3712.319
ends in your life up until

3707.839 --> 3716.799
death never ends once you realize that

3712.319 --> 3719.92
then fruits may become available

3716.799 --> 3719.92
the older you grow

3720.0 --> 3723.76
that you couldn't even imagine in your

3722.88 --> 3728.2400000000002
youth

3723.76 --> 3731.6800000000003
understand growing old only sucks

3728.24 --> 3731.68
if you stop growing

3738.319 --> 3742.48
once you decide it's over yeah then you

3741.599 --> 3744.7200000000003
degenerate

3742.48 --> 3746.64
you grow old and you just lose

3744.72 --> 3750.5589999999997
everything yeah that sucks

3746.64 --> 3755.839
but you don't have to if you realize

3750.559 --> 3755.8390000000004
you just shouldn't stop growing

3757.44 --> 3763.76
because there is infinite room

3760.48 --> 3766.2400000000002
for improvement in a person

3763.76 --> 3766.96
that realizes that they can never stop

3766.24 --> 3770.0
growing

3766.96 --> 3772.64
because stopping growing is death

3770.0 --> 3773.599
that's the real death it's the decision

3772.64 --> 3783.839
of death

3773.599 --> 3783.839
you understand

3793.039 --> 3799.8390000000004
right exactly george sanford you get it

3796.16 --> 3803.5989999999997
so does robin stanley oh robin stanley

3799.839 --> 3803.599
such a wise woman i love you

3808.079 --> 3811.8390000000004
my favorite movie

3812.48 --> 3817.039
there's no such thing there's too many

3814.559 --> 3820.799
movies

3817.039 --> 3825.8390000000004
i don't have a favorite that's just

3820.799 --> 3825.839
an untenable question at this point

3826.799 --> 3829.44
seriously

3833.039 --> 3836.7990000000004
but i think there's a lot of good movies

3836.0 --> 3839.839
matrix

3836.799 --> 3843.0389999999998
well yeah matrix is

3839.839 --> 3843.44
a life exemplary movie when i first saw

3843.039 --> 3846.0
it

3843.44 --> 3846.88
i literally made a decision this is what

3846.0 --> 3848.799
i am

3846.88 --> 3850.559
right it's very important to me i

3848.799 --> 3854.72
decided i

3850.559 --> 3858.2400000000002
am neo i am

3854.72 --> 3859.839
neo you understand you might not

3858.24 --> 3863.68
understand you might think

3859.839 --> 3867.92
oh that's when the psychosis started

3863.68 --> 3872.16
no i saw it i recognized it

3867.92 --> 3875.599
and i decided this is what i am

3872.16 --> 3879.0389999999998
this is awakening this is the decision

3875.599 --> 3882.079
to stand out this is my

3879.039 --> 3885.5200000000004
wizard them this is my form

3882.079 --> 3888.96
my format the style the format

3885.52 --> 3892.319
once i saw that i decided this is

3888.96 --> 3892.96
what i am and i meant it and i've stuck

3892.319 --> 3896.0
to it

3892.96 --> 3898.88
for over 20 years

3896.0 --> 3901.119
and i'm not gonna drop it so yeah matrix

3898.88 --> 3903.039
very important movie to me

3901.119 --> 3906.6400000000003
it's not the best movie that i've ever

3903.039 --> 3909.8390000000004
seen but it's incredibly important

3906.64 --> 3909.839
to me

3925.599 --> 3932.2400000000002
because yeah that form that format

3928.799 --> 3934.16
the style the modern style it's the

3932.24 --> 3935.68
modern wizard

3934.16 --> 3937.44
that's what they are that's what the

3935.68 --> 3939.839
suits are that's what the

3937.44 --> 3941.68
the plastic and the sunglasses and the

3939.839 --> 3944.4
long coats

3941.68 --> 3945.44
they're wizards guys they're modern

3944.4 --> 3949.359
wizards

3945.44 --> 3952.559
and i am one of them

3949.359 --> 3954.96
in the real world and it's real it's not

3952.559 --> 3956.559
a joke it's not a reenactment people may

3954.96 --> 3958.48
see it as such but it's real

3956.559 --> 3960.559
and so people come up to me sometimes

3958.48 --> 3962.96
say like hey wow you look like you just

3960.559 --> 3966.4
came out of the matrix haha cool

3962.96 --> 3968.2400000000002
and i say yeah well the matrix is real

3966.4 --> 3969.599
i'm just one of the few people that

3968.24 --> 3973.4399999999996
actually realizes

3969.599 --> 3976.559
it is real and i say dead serious

3973.44 --> 3981.52
and then they shut up

3976.559 --> 3981.52
happened many many times in the last few

3990.839 --> 3993.839
decades

3998.88 --> 4005.599
john barman's 1981

4002.48 --> 4008.88
excalibur i don't know that one

4005.599 --> 4010.559
that's i've never seen that or maybe i

4008.88 --> 4014.1600000000003
have

4010.559 --> 4017.28
but that name does not sound a bell

4014.16 --> 4017.2799999999997
ramesan stone

4018.839 --> 4024.5589999999997
hmm

4021.44 --> 4027.039
oh they live yeah they live great movie

4024.559 --> 4027.599
not the best movie ever made but a great

4027.039 --> 4032.1600000000003
movie

4027.599 --> 4035.52
great concept movie good style

4032.16 --> 4039.0389999999998
real american spirit at the bottom

4035.52 --> 4039.44
i love that part it it really shows it's

4039.039 --> 4042.7200000000003
like

4039.44 --> 4044.48
the honest american

4042.72 --> 4047.68
ground up building spirit the

4044.48 --> 4050.799
unstoppable spirit of the american

4047.68 --> 4051.5989999999997
versus the top down control mind

4050.799 --> 4053.68
controlling

4051.599 --> 4054.7200000000003
elite and that's what that movie

4053.68 --> 4057.9199999999996
depicted like

4054.72 --> 4061.4399999999996
nothing else as a perfect concept movie

4057.92 --> 4062.0
perfect masterpiece a masterpiece

4061.44 --> 4065.839
definitely

4062.0 --> 4066.799
they live masterpiece but the best movie

4065.839 --> 4070.0789999999997
ever made

4066.799 --> 4077.839
nah i don't know but it was really good

4070.079 --> 4077.8390000000004
i agree marco bugs

4088.24 --> 4095.2799999999997
invasion of the body snatchers

4091.599 --> 4099.04
oh that movie creeped the [ __ ] out of me

4095.28 --> 4099.04
i don't like it it's too creepy

4099.279 --> 4102.96
like the idea that you just can't sleep

4101.12 --> 4106.159
because you'll die it's just so

4102.96 --> 4108.56
[ __ ] so [ __ ]

4106.159 --> 4108.5599999999995
terrible

4112.64 --> 4116.08
yeah that's really nice earth passenger

4115.04 --> 4119.2789999999995
yes they're all

4116.08 --> 4122.48
transsexual liberal freaks

4119.279 --> 4126.0
so what who gives a

4122.48 --> 4127.919999999999
[ __ ] what the directors do to themselves

4126.0 --> 4130.0
that they kill themselves if they

4127.92 --> 4132.4800000000005
start to go and murder i don't give a

4130.0 --> 4135.839
[ __ ] the matrix movie

4132.48 --> 4136.48
was a piece of art and i don't give a

4135.839 --> 4138.239
[ __ ]

4136.48 --> 4140.159
what the directors do to themselves i

4138.239 --> 4142.959999999999
don't give a [ __ ] they can go

4140.159 --> 4143.92
kill themselves for all i care the movie

4142.96 --> 4146.4800000000005
they made

4143.92 --> 4148.4800000000005
is just fantastic and i don't give a

4146.48 --> 4151.08
[ __ ] what they do

4148.48 --> 4153.5199999999995
so don't shove somebody else's

4151.08 --> 4156.64
retardation at my feet

4153.52 --> 4157.92
like that actually can take away the

4156.64 --> 4162.64
power of a movie

4157.92 --> 4162.64
earth passenger do you understand

4164.4 --> 4169.839
and no it was not about the [ __ ]

4167.199 --> 4175.3589999999995
awakening of being a woman inside

4169.839 --> 4179.759
that's [ __ ] it's [ __ ]

4175.359 --> 4183.839
that's you that's you

4179.759 --> 4185.44
that's pc thinking you understand

4183.839 --> 4188.239
sorry to be rough on you but that's like

4185.44 --> 4203.839999999999
the very annoying [ __ ] thing you just

4188.239 --> 4203.839999999999
said there

4210.68 --> 4213.799
[Music]

4222.239 --> 4227.839999999999
well ah israelite

4226.0 --> 4229.6
is really aren't you supposed to be

4227.84 --> 4232.159000000001
called arch israelite

4229.6 --> 4233.52
because this h there is just completely

4232.159 --> 4236.239
out of place makes no damn

4233.52 --> 4236.2390000000005
sense in your name

4237.92 --> 4243.4400000000005
right but yes

4241.199 --> 4246.0
like how that movie would be related to

4243.44 --> 4249.36
sex is

4246.0 --> 4252.56
i can't really imagine how nobody

4249.36 --> 4254.96
ever has even sex in that movie except

4252.56 --> 4260.400000000001
the second one in the second one

4254.96 --> 4260.4
trinity and neo do have sex in the caves

4261.04 --> 4264.48
that's it that's the one time that sex

4263.92 --> 4266.719
is

4264.48 --> 4267.839999999999
involved entirely in the entire

4266.719 --> 4270.32
franchise

4267.84 --> 4272.4800000000005
so if you see sex in everything then you

4270.32 --> 4287.84
got a [ __ ] issue buddy

4272.48 --> 4287.839999999999
you got pcha syndrome

4288.32 --> 4292.48
anyway i don't want to lose track of

4290.159 --> 4296.96
this what was this movie suggestion

4292.48 --> 4299.12
excalibur 1981

4296.96 --> 4301.52
i want to look that up because i don't

4299.12 --> 4315.84
ever ever remember having seen that and

4301.52 --> 4315.84
i'm really curious

4330.719 --> 4334.88
uh okay

4335.679 --> 4341.76
ah is a hebrew translation for brother

4338.96 --> 4342.4800000000005
oh oh sorry i didn't know that i really

4341.76 --> 4345.84
didn't

4342.48 --> 4349.5199999999995
it just seemed weird to me because

4345.84 --> 4351.4400000000005
arch ezra light does make sense to me

4349.52 --> 4353.1990000000005
that's actually kind of a funny thing to

4351.44 --> 4356.0
say but i guess

4353.199 --> 4359.04
yeah sorry about that i didn't know it

4356.0 --> 4359.04
just seemed weird to me

4369.52 --> 4382.4800000000005
all right so it's excor

4377.52 --> 4382.4800000000005
uh 1981 right

4382.84 --> 4388.0
scaliburg excali

4389.199 --> 4395.36
scalibur it was 1981 right

4397.679 --> 4405.4400000000005

4451.92 --> 4456.159
right so yeah i got another little

4453.84 --> 4457.679
detail i'm so much hesitant to say it

4456.159 --> 4458.48
because i feel a little ashamed about

4457.679 --> 4462.2390000000005
myself

4458.48 --> 4465.12
because i think i i did something

4462.239 --> 4468.5599999999995
financially a little stupid

4465.12 --> 4470.96
again and i'm really ashamed because

4468.56 --> 4472.88
basically with doing that i've kind of

4470.96 --> 4474.4
feel like i shamed you guys supporting

4472.88 --> 4477.84
me

4474.4 --> 4481.5199999999995
because i i bought a video game

4477.84 --> 4483.84
60 euros and i i can't really afford

4481.52 --> 4485.1990000000005
that in retrospect but it's just that i

4483.84 --> 4488.400000000001
had to do it

4485.199 --> 4490.239
i just had to do it it's like for my

4488.4 --> 4492.96
personal research and

4490.239 --> 4493.839999999999
maybe now i can dig into that and just

4492.96 --> 4497.28
not

4493.84 --> 4500.8
go out of my mind with boredom at times

4497.28 --> 4504.48
because i bought baldur's gate 3.

4500.8 --> 4504.4800000000005
it's like a download only thing

4504.88 --> 4512.8
requires 70 gigabytes

4508.159 --> 4518.32
70 gigabytes of installation room

4512.8 --> 4518.320000000001
70 gigabytes [ __ ] insane

4518.4 --> 4522.4
but i did it i'm still in the middle of

4520.48 --> 4523.36
trying to install it it's literally

4522.4 --> 4527.04
taken

4523.36 --> 4530.5599999999995
over over 12 hours

4527.04 --> 4533.84
of non-stop try non-stop time

4530.56 --> 4534.4800000000005
installing it it's crazy it's still not

4533.84 --> 4539.84
finished

4534.48 --> 4539.839999999999
it's at 92 percent

4540.88 --> 4548.08
green man gaming no i got it from gog

4543.92 --> 4549.84
gog games yes now i want you guys to

4548.08 --> 4553.6
reimburse me because

4549.84 --> 4557.1990000000005

4553.6 --> 4561.1990000000005
what what no

4557.199 --> 4562.239
what the [ __ ] holy [ __ ] obs just called

4561.199 --> 4566.08
me to

4562.239 --> 4569.44
turn what

4566.08 --> 4572.08
what the hell was that oh

4569.44 --> 4573.199
it's installed it's actually finished

4572.08 --> 4576.4
right

4573.199 --> 4579.199
so yes it sounds embarrassing

4576.4 --> 4580.32
but can you please guys help me out it's

4579.199 --> 4584.879999999999
a little expensive

4580.32 --> 4587.759999999999
it's going to be my only game purchase

4584.88 --> 4588.4800000000005
for a very long time to come but now i

4587.76 --> 4592.320000000001
have a

4588.48 --> 4594.32
proper updated dnd type game

4592.32 --> 4596.96
that's kind of beautiful and i'm really

4594.32 --> 4598.0
curious i'm really curious about this

4596.96 --> 4601.679
game

4598.0 --> 4601.679
you know it's been

4602.32 --> 4609.599999999999
it's been over two decades since the

4605.36 --> 4613.44
last game came out

4609.6 --> 4615.679
so i i hope you guys yeah you're not all

4613.44 --> 4618.879999999999
really disappointed in me

4615.679 --> 4619.84
i am a little because it was a big [ __ ]

4618.88 --> 4622.96
load of money

4619.84 --> 4626.56
so i want to apologize if i

4622.96 --> 4628.32
if yeah if people think it's shameful

4626.56 --> 4631.04
especially to those that actually do

4628.32 --> 4635.199
give me money people like

4631.04 --> 4639.36
dank and guns of nephron rmp

4635.199 --> 4644.159
and yeah

4639.36 --> 4646.32
did i miss anyone what's the other guy

4644.159 --> 4648.159
the guys that typically do basically

4646.32 --> 4652.239
help me afloat i'm sorry

4648.159 --> 4652.96
i'm sorry it just it was just staring at

4652.239 --> 4655.919999999999
me and

4652.96 --> 4657.36
i said that brandon yes you yes you too

4655.92 --> 4659.679
i'm sorry

4657.36 --> 4662.48
it's just that i i it's kind of like

4659.679 --> 4665.04
part of my development

4662.48 --> 4666.0
you know i like baldur's gate this

4665.04 --> 4667.6
franchise

4666.0 --> 4669.199
originally you think it's the greatest

4667.6 --> 4671.52
game ever made

4669.199 --> 4674.159
and i just want to see if this game is a

4671.52 --> 4676.400000000001
worthy successor

4674.159 --> 4678.32
and have some things to do so i'm sorry

4676.4 --> 4680.799999999999
that i did this

4678.32 --> 4682.08
but i kind of had to so i hope that you

4680.8 --> 4684.4800000000005
guys

4682.08 --> 4686.64

4684.48 --> 4687.5199999999995

and you said yeah go for it

4793.679 --> 4797.6
but yeah it should be holding you

4795.6 --> 4800.400000000001
accountable for that because you were

4797.6 --> 4800.400000000001

4801.12 --> 4805.28
if it inspires you use it for good yes i

4803.76 --> 4808.320000000001

4805.28 --> 4810.159
that's why i i wanted to do it to just

4808.32 --> 4811.44
look it could turn out to be a pretty

4810.159 --> 4814.638999999999
terrible game

4811.44 --> 4817.678999999999
because there's a lot of dialogue

4814.639 --> 4818.08
no doubt it's all going to be filled

4817.679 --> 4821.28
with

4818.08 --> 4821.76
creepy gay people thoughts because

4821.28 --> 4824.96
they're

4821.76 --> 4827.12
all gay all of them all the [ __ ]

4824.96 --> 4830.4
programmers out there they're all

4827.12 --> 4834.48
a bunch of homos every single

4830.4 --> 4836.159
one of them all leftist gay ass [ __ ]

4834.48 --> 4837.599999999999
they're good at what they do but they're

4836.159 --> 4841.12
all [ __ ] gay

4837.6 --> 4842.8
so i am ready to get a lot of gay [ __ ]

4841.12 --> 4845.92
shoved down my face

4842.8 --> 4849.12
unfortunately and i'm gonna see if it's

4845.92 --> 4849.12
still gonna be worth it

4855.12 --> 4860.719
but as for the looks of the game it's

4857.12 --> 4865.28
pretty badass looking

4860.719 --> 4868.4800000000005
at a really good graphic department

4865.28 --> 4871.28
and the music too the music is good and

4868.48 --> 4874.159
classical and i love that that's always

4871.28 --> 4875.679
the music was the core of what made

4874.159 --> 4878.799999999999
baldur's gate great

4875.679 --> 4881.92
the core of it the music and they

4878.8 --> 4882.639
kept the style they kept the french

4881.92 --> 4885.76
horns they

4882.639 --> 4888.4800000000005
kept the violins and all that so it's

4885.76 --> 4889.6
the music should be great looking you

4888.48 --> 4903.839999999999
know even if the game

4889.6 --> 4903.84
sucks i will have the music

4970.88 --> 4974.32
window

4971.52 --> 4975.6
oh you mean in the room where i do

4974.32 --> 4978.719
everything

4975.6 --> 4981.84
including sleeping right because

4978.719 --> 4982.88
look look at that there is so much room

5289.76 --> 5297.12

[Music]

5309.28 --> 5313.28
de-bloat your windows what

5319.0 --> 5323.84
[Music]

5320.84 --> 5323.84
hmm

5332.54 --> 5335.68
[Music]

5339.199 --> 5345.839999999999
all right and hey

5342.8 --> 5346.719
i'm i'm doing pretty good in the

5345.84 --> 5349.4400000000005
background

5346.719 --> 5352.0
with my gti company and i've connected

5349.44 --> 5354.32
to some of you about it

5352.0 --> 5355.28
i got big plans with that i got big

5354.32 --> 5357.759999999999
plans

5355.28 --> 5359.36
good plans plans that most of you are

5357.76 --> 5362.2390000000005
going to be envious as

5359.36 --> 5362.799999999999
[ __ ] about when it really starts to

5362.239 --> 5366.159
bloom

5362.8 --> 5369.360000000001
really bloom we could be

5366.159 --> 5370.159
rich but it's only going to be the

5369.36 --> 5373.36
people that

5370.159 --> 5376.48
actually deserve it and that can

5373.36 --> 5378.88
wield it without corrupting

5376.48 --> 5379.599999999999
i'm going to be very specific and who i

5378.88 --> 5382.719
pick

5379.6 --> 5385.1990000000005
to be part of that do not

5382.719 --> 5388.96
try to become one of these people

5385.199 --> 5388.96
because i will shun you

5389.04 --> 5392.239
i will approach you you will not

5391.28 --> 5394.4
approach me

5392.239 --> 5397.678999999999
that's how it will go and that's the

5394.4 --> 5397.679
only way it will go

5397.92 --> 5405.28
so there you go

5402.56 --> 5406.080000000001
and then in the future i might actually

5405.28 --> 5409.36
have a really

5406.08 --> 5412.5599999999995
nice place for myself with a garden

5409.36 --> 5414.48
with a garden because i want one i want

5412.56 --> 5414.96
a place with a garden so i can have a

5414.48 --> 5418.08
cat

5414.96 --> 5421.52
that can poo in the dirt and be

5418.08 --> 5424.88
really happy because cats shoot [ __ ]

5421.52 --> 5428.639
in gardens it's in their nature it makes

5424.88 --> 5428.639
them happy it's healthy for them

5430.159 --> 5434.0
and yeah i don't want another cat unless

5432.48 --> 5437.599999999999
they can literally poo in

5434.0 --> 5438.0
their inner garden that's my condition

5437.6 --> 5440.88
for

5438.0 --> 5440.88
getting a new cat

5444.88 --> 5449.679
i call for exploration in the yeah i

5447.84 --> 5452.0
know who lumberjack is lumberjack is

5449.679 --> 5452.0
awesome

5453.44 --> 5458.719
lumberjack is a good guy i'm not worried

5456.4 --> 5462.879999999999
about him

5458.719 --> 5465.199
is he in chat

5462.88 --> 5465.1990000000005
where

5466.08 --> 5476.96

5468.96 --> 5479.04
good morning lumberjack good to see you

5476.96 --> 5480.56
i'm not worrying about lumberjack he

5479.04 --> 5483.36
literally has a wrench don't know if

5480.56 --> 5483.360000000001
you've seen that

5487.199 --> 5494.08
paper what people a hundred

5491.36 --> 5494.96
the [ __ ] i don't know will lumberjack

5494.08 --> 5497.199
give me that

5494.96 --> 5498.56
that would be awesome lumberjack i i can

5497.199 --> 5501.199
literally use it

5498.56 --> 5504.080000000001
really well but i'm not demanding that

5501.199 --> 5506.32
of you of course

5504.08 --> 5508.96
yes i can really use a paypal donation

5506.32 --> 5512.0
because i kind of just

5508.96 --> 5515.36
spent a lot of money that i don't

5512.0 --> 5518.56
really have on a computer game

5515.36 --> 5520.32
to basically research and amuse me for

5518.56 --> 5523.4400000000005
years to come

5520.32 --> 5524.32
it's like the video game for me baldur's

5523.44 --> 5527.36
gate 3

5524.32 --> 5529.44
which is of the continuation of the

5527.36 --> 5531.04
franchise of the best game that i've

5529.44 --> 5534.5599999999995
ever played

5531.04 --> 5536.96
as a gamer since i was six

5534.56 --> 5539.04
baldur's gate is the best game franchise

5536.96 --> 5543.28
that has ever existed

5539.04 --> 5543.28
so i was bound to get it at some point

5543.92 --> 5547.1990000000005
it's just that it costs a lot of money

5545.679 --> 5550.0
and i don't really have it and i

5547.199 --> 5551.36
i made that blatantly clear and i hope

5550.0 --> 5552.96
that people will

5551.36 --> 5554.88
kind of on the short run help me out

5552.96 --> 5558.2390000000005
with that through paypal

5554.88 --> 5561.84
so it's not going to be a big chunk

5558.239 --> 5561.839999999999
out of my food money

5562.0 --> 5566.159
call of duty the best game for yeah yeah

5564.4 --> 5567.36
yeah no i don't like first person

5566.159 --> 5570.719
shooters

5567.36 --> 5574.159
at all at all so no

5570.719 --> 5576.4
but you like it that's good for you i

5574.159 --> 5578.638999999999
hear it's a very well crafted type of

5576.4 --> 5578.638999999999
game

5583.679 --> 5588.2390000000005
yeah that's very cute that's very cute

5586.719 --> 5591.679
i'm not going to this

5588.239 --> 5595.36
room is not suited

5591.679 --> 5599.12
for that do you hear me do you hear me

5595.36 --> 5602.32
it's very cute i don't have the room

5599.12 --> 5605.44
and the patience and the money for

5602.32 --> 5608.96
any type of growing activity

5605.44 --> 5612.159
i got potted plants with herbs

5608.96 --> 5614.8
downstairs in the kitchen and that's

5612.159 --> 5616.0
my garden activity i take very good care

5614.8 --> 5620.2390000000005
of these plants i got

5616.0 --> 5623.12
basil plants that are over two years old

5620.239 --> 5624.879999999999
and they're still thriving two years and

5623.12 --> 5627.679
they're still thriving

5624.88 --> 5628.2390000000005
right that's my garden activity that's

5627.679 --> 5630.56
it

5628.239 --> 5631.36
that's what it's going to be in this

5630.56 --> 5634.4800000000005
house

5631.36 --> 5635.599999999999
i don't have money or patience for

5634.48 --> 5638.638999999999
anything else

5635.6 --> 5639.04
in this house and as long as i live here

5638.639 --> 5642.4800000000005
that

5639.04 --> 5644.4
is what it's going to be sorry if i

5642.48 --> 5646.0
overreacted a little it wasn't

5644.4 --> 5649.36
necessarily directed to you

5646.0 --> 5651.199
as towards the other stupid [ __ ]

5649.36 --> 5652.48
that whine and complain about me

5651.199 --> 5654.719
spending money

5652.48 --> 5657.12
it's none of their damn business they've

5654.719 --> 5659.28
never even appeared in my chat before

5657.12 --> 5660.32
so don't take it too hard there what a

5659.28 --> 5663.04
world

5660.32 --> 5665.5199999999995
i see you just wanted to give some green

5663.04 --> 5673.84
advice that's very cool

5665.52 --> 5673.84
it's not gonna work here so

5686.159 --> 5690.599999999999
right bullet gate should be a good value

5688.719 --> 5693.92
game bang for your block wise

5690.6 --> 5695.6
absolutely absolutely look the baldis

5693.92 --> 5698.4800000000005
gate one game

5695.6 --> 5698.96
i did buy it originally on a cd no less

5698.48 --> 5702.638999999999
right

5698.96 --> 5706.76
cds i've played that game

5702.639 --> 5711.119
through and through at least

5706.76 --> 5714.88
200 times 200 times

5711.119 --> 5718.159
from beginning to end 200 times at least

5714.88 --> 5720.32
it's that [ __ ] good so yeah

5718.159 --> 5722.5599999999995
absolutely worth the investment is

5720.32 --> 5725.759999999999
baldur's gate 3 gonna be just as good

5722.56 --> 5728.639
i don't know i almost doubt it

5725.76 --> 5730.400000000001
because it's a whole new medium it's all

5728.639 --> 5733.84
3d graphics now

5730.4 --> 5734.32
and that kind of tends to railroad

5733.84 --> 5737.1990000000005
things

5734.32 --> 5739.36
very tightly and not make it as

5737.199 --> 5740.799999999999
replayable that's my experience with

5739.36 --> 5743.679
computer games

5740.8 --> 5744.08
so but who knows who knows how how well

5743.679 --> 5748.4800000000005
they

5744.08 --> 5748.48
they constructed it we'll see

5748.8 --> 5752.400000000001
but i've bought it i got it i'm i

5751.679 --> 5756.96
finished

5752.4 --> 5759.599999999999
installing it just a half an hour ago

5756.96 --> 5759.6
and we'll see

5762.239 --> 5765.44
if you could cut down on your food for

5763.92 --> 5767.84
the rest of the month you could pay for

5765.44 --> 5772.239
it yourself

5767.84 --> 5774.400000000001
how funny funny mark taylor

5772.239 --> 5776.959999999999
why don't you donate to my paypal right

5774.4 --> 5779.599999999999
now or i'll ban you

5776.96 --> 5779.6
how about that

5780.719 --> 5787.119
give me 10 euros on my paypal

5785.04 --> 5799.84
and i'll allow you to say how about that

5787.119 --> 5799.839999999999
mark taylor

5802.4 --> 5805.839999999999
i don't know earth passenger i'm not an

5804.32 --> 5807.599999999999
electronics expert

5805.84 --> 5808.88
i know my computer is really [ __ ]

5807.6 --> 5812.8
good

5808.88 --> 5816.56
and that's all i need to know i

5812.8 --> 5818.719
i built it part by part myself i

5816.56 --> 5819.76
constructed it myself and it worked

5818.719 --> 5821.52
really well

5819.76 --> 5822.88
very proud of it i'm not gonna need an

5821.52 --> 5825.6
upgrade

5822.88 --> 5827.1990000000005
i might need a new ssd upgrade but i'm

5825.6 --> 5829.52
not gonna ask for that because that's

5827.199 --> 5832.799999999999
gonna cost like at least 120

5829.52 --> 5835.6
20 euros or something not gonna do that

5832.8 --> 5839.4400000000005
i don't necessarily need it

5835.6 --> 5843.52
but it would be handy to have

5839.44 --> 5844.799999999999
because yeah this this new stuff it's

5843.52 --> 5849.119000000001
all

5844.8 --> 5849.679
so high data i had to actually install

5849.119 --> 5853.679
the game

5849.679 --> 5869.84
on my data disk because my standard ssd

5853.679 --> 5869.84
disk for games did not have enough room

5869.92 --> 5873.76
all right anyway i'm checking paypal

5876.88 --> 5884.400000000001
anybody still like to donate

5882.239 --> 5887.919999999999

see how far this scrolls back yeah what

6113.52 --> 6116.080000000001
a world

unhide on this channel okay i unbanned

6119.92 --> 6123.6
your original account my apologies for

6122.159 --> 6125.599999999999
being a little rash there i

6123.6 --> 6127.04
i kind of thought that there was a troll

6125.6 --> 6129.52
group rolling in

6127.04 --> 6132.08
and i thought that you were part of it

6129.52 --> 6134.320000000001
so my apologies for that

6132.08 --> 6135.84
please definitely do not go out and kill

6134.32 --> 6141.599999999999
yourself

6135.84 --> 6141.6
all right i hope to see you back

6143.44 --> 6150.719
wanna hear about excalibur later

6147.119 --> 6153.679
yeah well i will probably watch it

6150.719 --> 6154.56
i don't know yeah if it's going to be

6153.679 --> 6156.2390000000005
yeah i will

6154.56 --> 6158.320000000001
i am going to watch it somewhere in the

6156.239 --> 6163.839999999999
evening probably when things grow a

6158.32 --> 6163.84
little bit more quiet

6171.04 --> 6178.0
people like michael jones get it they do

6175.199 --> 6180.239
but [ __ ] man it's like that's a lot of

6178.0 --> 6183.679
money

6180.239 --> 6184.4
i i'm hap it's a happy realization that

6183.679 --> 6186.88
he has

6184.4 --> 6188.96
that kind of financial maneuvering room

6186.88 --> 6191.28
in order to do that

6188.96 --> 6192.0
because i certainly hope that you didn't

6191.28 --> 6194.48
just

6192.0 --> 6195.04
basically made a move that's going to

6194.48 --> 6197.119
make you

6195.04 --> 6198.56
hungry for a period i don't want that on

6197.119 --> 6200.48
my conscience either

6198.56 --> 6202.4800000000005
that's why i asked maybe if everybody

6200.48 --> 6205.839999999999
just gave me 10 euros

6202.48 --> 6206.5599999999995
that would fix it but but i trust that

6205.84 --> 6209.92
you didn't

6206.56 --> 6210.88
do something rash like that michael

6209.92 --> 6213.4400000000005
jones

6210.88 --> 6219.84
thank you so much you absolutely saved

out of it i hope

it's definitely going to have good music

6363.679 --> 6366.4
for starters

6369.76 --> 6373.360000000001
although look on the other i'm not too

6372.0 --> 6376.96
eager to even start up

6373.36 --> 6379.28
playing it i just need to

6376.96 --> 6381.36
need to let it sink all first because

6379.28 --> 6381.92
yeah once you start engaging in game

6381.36 --> 6384.799999999999
then it

6381.92 --> 6386.8
really will draw away everything it just

6384.8 --> 6388.639
it used to do that

6386.8 --> 6391.52
man the first time i i played

6388.639 --> 6395.119
neverwinter night 2

6391.52 --> 6398.320000000001
i had a week where i would literally

6395.119 --> 6401.679
play it 16 hours straight

6398.32 --> 6404.08
every day 16 hours straight

6401.679 --> 6406.159
only half an hour break to get some

6404.08 --> 6408.639
groceries

6406.159 --> 6409.28
and like quick run to the bathroom in

6408.639 --> 6411.52
between

6409.28 --> 6414.159
and that's all i was doing i got so

6411.52 --> 6417.4400000000005
consumed by that game

6414.159 --> 6419.5199999999995
and i don't want that to happen because

6417.44 --> 6422.879999999999
it's not very healthy for me

6419.52 --> 6425.679
i get obsessed so

6422.88 --> 6428.96
i want to kind of like carefully

6425.679 --> 6431.76
carefully approach the new game

6428.96 --> 6433.76
so that i don't basically start to drop

6431.76 --> 6436.0
everything and then even

6433.76 --> 6437.84
quit the early bird show because oh [ __ ]

6436.0 --> 6439.92
i forgot it was supposed to start up the

6437.84 --> 6440.96
early bird show an hour ago and i didn't

6439.92 --> 6444.0
sleep all night

6440.96 --> 6448.8

6444.0 --> 6448.8
yeah that's not responsible so

6451.04 --> 6458.32

6454.32 --> 6461.679
