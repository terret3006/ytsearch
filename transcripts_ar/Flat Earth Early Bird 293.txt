[Music]

37.12 --> 44.36
good morning welcome to flattered at the

40.91 --> 46.04
earlybird number 292 I'm your host

44.36 --> 47.6
Arwen and before I start the show please

46.04 --> 49.58
don't forget to share it on any platform

47.6 --> 51.17
you deem fit and if you haven't already

49.58 --> 52.82
subscribed to my channel and hit the

51.17 --> 54.800000000000004
bell notification so you know when I'm

52.82 --> 59.12
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

54.8 --> 61.669999999999995
Amsterdam time hmm everyday also please

59.12 --> 64.369
do support my channel through the paypal

61.67 --> 66.58
patreon and my GoFundMe or through the

64.369 --> 69.61
super chat if you have no other way that

66.58 --> 75.2
would be much appreciated

69.61 --> 77.18
so the weather today is glorious while

75.2 --> 80.27000000000001
it is right now it's been a little bit

77.18 --> 83.78
cloudy in there no rain whatsoever very

80.27 --> 87.05
nice blue don't see a lot of chemtrails

83.78 --> 91.43
haven't seen them for a while kind of

87.05 --> 97.88
glad and the Sun is nice and warm but

91.43 --> 99.52000000000001
yeah you can definitely feel that the

97.88 --> 104.08999999999999
main part of the summer is over

99.52 --> 107.84
definitely so if we're lucky we're gonna

104.09 --> 110.569
have maybe a few weeks of this but I'd

107.84 --> 112.88000000000001
probably start raining really really

110.569 --> 115.149
heavily at some point it always does in

112.88 --> 118.16
September

115.149 --> 121.899
except for a few occasions anyway yeah

118.16 --> 121.899
it's beautiful day

123.61 --> 131.26
right and I see now that this is

127.81 --> 137.94
actually flattered early-bird number 293

131.26 --> 145.5
for some reason I forgot to update it

137.94 --> 146.91
that is all never happened before so I

145.5 --> 149.55
guess

146.91 --> 152.17
welcome to Flat Earth early bird number

149.55 --> 155.14000000000001
293 I'm your host

152.17 --> 157.51
Arwen and I'm not gonna repeat all of

155.14 --> 160.57
that so today I have with me

157.51 --> 168.94
Tamara coffee and and tea just like

160.57 --> 171.63
yesterday no edibles alright let's see

168.94 --> 171.63
who is in chat

174.18 --> 179.45000000000002
yeah Fyodor Dostoevsky came in for the

177.15 --> 179.45000000000002
early

183.42 --> 190.10999999999999
thought some some artist guy on YouTube

186.51 --> 196.53
might be interesting for me to perhaps

190.11 --> 198.39000000000001
ask artwork from I don't know got a

196.53 --> 203.84
weird feeling about him anyway

198.39 --> 209.51999999999998
a GM was there Steve

203.84 --> 213.3
Amanda young stone monkey 3d over Mukul

209.52 --> 219.33
the meets kang and rex j-mac ego playing

213.3 --> 221.489
an anchor yeah good to see you all yeah

219.33 --> 229.38000000000002
apparently dropped an interesting video

221.489 --> 231.78
in Skype today yeah I

229.38 --> 234.89
I'll just repost it it's pretty good

231.78 --> 234.89000000000001
link it's not that long

235.64 --> 246.14999999999998
it's a a sighted ripple over Saturn the

243.44 --> 249.15
actual camera observation of Saturn it's

246.15 --> 254.63
pretty fascinating so it's not that long

249.15 --> 258.54
I do check it out so yeah more hints

254.63 --> 261.9
that the entire globe of the heavens all

258.54 --> 265.19
the lights in the sky our holographic in

261.9 --> 269.52
nature not just the moon the moon ripple

265.19 --> 272.56
but while Saturn as well and

269.52 --> 275.78999999999996
also there were links I think in the

272.56 --> 279.46
description box of that video to other

275.79 --> 280.69
planets having ripples over them as well

279.46 --> 284.48999999999995
I don't know I haven't checked it out

280.69 --> 284.49
yet anyway that was pretty interesting

285.59 --> 291.07
[Music]

288.0 --> 294.24
thank you for that can be oh if you're

291.07 --> 294.24
hearing noise it's because

296.42 --> 304.25
yeah you can hear that obviously okay

299.21 --> 308.27
that's work being done next door that's

304.25 --> 310.34
just a great timing testing and drilling

308.27 --> 311.44
in concrete just at the right time

310.34 --> 314.77
[Music]

311.44 --> 314.77
anyway um

321.82 --> 329.5
okay Fyodor Dostoevsky yeah well extreme

325.18 --> 331.63
experiences can unleash quite the

329.5 --> 334.89
experience with some people especially

331.63 --> 340.5
if you're artistically talented

334.89 --> 343.5
extremeties I know that from experience

340.5 --> 343.5
anyway

348.45 --> 362.81
a bender bandsaw bandit Ragnar Stefan

355.5 --> 362.81
l-listen Cerrito Cosentino

365.22 --> 379.29
I study time sorry hmm so yeah yesterday

374.82 --> 382.26
I was kind of an all day I I was invited

379.29 --> 384.81
on grantees I kind of took a look around

382.26 --> 389.01
in the chat and I don't know was kind of

384.81 --> 392.67
a a debate crowd although yes first

389.01 --> 395.88
chemo was there as well so I kind of

392.67 --> 400.43
went on but I wasn't really prepared for

395.88 --> 404.46
that so and I did have a few beers so

400.43 --> 408.0
and I was making dinner and all that so

404.46 --> 409.34999999999997
I kind of missed some things I know you

408.0 --> 419.72
might have noticed me that I didn't

409.35 --> 425.46000000000004
really do a lot though I Cerrito

419.72 --> 427.11
Cosentino Sarita Cosentino why people

425.46 --> 431.88
can't understand the two reference

427.11 --> 435.90000000000003
frames well because they the ones that

431.88 --> 438.99
keep on misunderstanding that have some

435.9 --> 441.12
kind of belief the ones that keep on

438.99 --> 443.36
misunderstanding misunderstand it

441.12 --> 446.04
because they don't want to understand

443.36 --> 449.28000000000003
because they can feel what happens when

446.04 --> 452.31
they do so they're preventing their

449.28 --> 455.03999999999996
understanding from setting in that's why

452.31 --> 459.23
this keeps on going forever why they all

455.04 --> 462.20000000000005
are literally behaving like lunatics

459.23 --> 466.59000000000003
because they don't want to understand

462.2 --> 469.08
they they don't know what to do with it

466.59 --> 473.01
so they'll just ignore it forever

469.08 --> 474.62
and try to make as much distraction and

473.01 --> 477.01
confusion as possible

474.62 --> 480.61
[Music]

477.01 --> 483.31
I did I'm not even sure if it is a

480.61 --> 486.16
conscious thing they do I think it's

483.31 --> 488.65
much more subconscious driven because of

486.16 --> 491.62
how I explained like if they allow the

488.65 --> 494.14
understanding of what it is to sink in

491.62 --> 495.79
and they don't build some kind of

494.14 --> 498.90999999999997
surreal alternative to it that

495.79 --> 502.3
completely doesn't make any sense then

498.91 --> 504.70000000000005
they figure out that there's a big gap

502.3 --> 508.78000000000003
in their system of their entire belief

504.7 --> 511.3
so their subconscious feels that before

508.78 --> 514.11
they understand it that's how it happens

511.3 --> 518.5600000000001
and because of that signal they know

514.11 --> 523.03
retreat retreat but to say face just

518.56 --> 529.4499999999999
make a mess of it and just pretend like

523.03 --> 530.8
you don't understand then they

529.45 --> 533.6800000000001
technically don't really allow

530.8 --> 536.4599999999999
themselves to understand so it is sort

533.68 --> 542.1999999999999
of the truth but they are knowingly

536.46 --> 544.44
manipulating themselves as it were it's

542.2 --> 544.44
weird

549.17 --> 552.39
[Music]

554.06 --> 567.26
yeah but I get the Coriolis effect by

556.79 --> 570.02
now it's not that difficult right

567.26 --> 575.42
because the look the Coriolis is not

570.02 --> 577.5799999999999
even a like a material thing it's just

575.42 --> 582.1999999999999
an effect it's an effect as a

577.58 --> 585.08
consequence of while the changing

582.2 --> 587.48
reference frames that's it so it is only

585.08 --> 589.9100000000001
an apparent effect that's why it's an

587.48 --> 591.5
apparent effect doesn't mean that that

589.91 --> 595.4
it's not real that it's not consistent

591.5 --> 600.68
but it's an apparent effect a side

595.4 --> 602.75
effect as it were and that part is what

600.68 --> 605.27
the ballers really don't allow to

602.75 --> 610.0
manifest they are trying to make it into

605.27 --> 612.4399999999999
its own weird little phenomena somehow

610.0 --> 619.3
just like gravity and all the other

612.44 --> 619.3000000000001
things so they're mythologizing it

622.92 --> 625.92
anyway

632.2 --> 641.86
no no here for lulz okay that's just

637.899 --> 644.44
[ __ ] we have been willing to

641.86 --> 649.12
entertain if we entertain the other side

644.44 --> 652.5400000000001
all the time and some of us a little

649.12 --> 656.589
deeper than others I happen to like to

652.54 --> 659.41
go up until the nitty-gritty because I'm

656.589 --> 669.0600000000001
not uncomfortable with going there again

659.41 --> 672.04
I have like a designer's interest in it

669.06 --> 676.06
so I'm willing to go very up and close

672.04 --> 678.579
up to the entire design but yeah others

676.06 --> 680.56
don't as much they're just sick of it

678.579 --> 682.5
they're sick of the nonsense of the

680.56 --> 686.4699999999999
distraction because it is a distraction

682.5 --> 694.389
from what is actually happening so what

686.47 --> 697.9300000000001
most of it is anyway so yeah that's

694.389 --> 700.149
nonsense it's not symmetrical okay the

697.93 --> 702.579
situation is not symmetrical it's not

700.149 --> 706.06
like both sides are literally doing the

702.579 --> 707.68
same like nemesis political opponents

706.06 --> 709.8699999999999
that's not true one is completely

707.68 --> 712.7399999999999
different and then the other just

709.87 --> 718.39
totally different one is very

712.74 --> 721.72
centralized with like Imperial

718.39 --> 725.26
structuring and a lot of funding and

721.72 --> 728.74
back foundations and acceptance by

725.26 --> 731.35
society so more tolerance towards their

728.74 --> 734.89
miserable behavior probably roughly on

731.35 --> 739.48
average I don't know depends the other

734.89 --> 742.62
is completely decentralized messy people

739.48 --> 746.35
that often don't have a lot of money or

742.62 --> 749.639
get in trouble because of the societal

746.35 --> 754.36
attitude for doing what they do

749.639 --> 757.48
concerning yeah the flat earth so it's

754.36 --> 759.94
not symmetrical at all nothing about

757.48 --> 763.51
this whole situation is symmetrical at

759.94 --> 767.49
all and the same goes for the actual

763.51 --> 767.49
arguments it's not symmetrical at all

768.1 --> 776.33
the the ballers constantly almost

772.09 --> 779.5400000000001
blatantly abuse misunderstandings of the

776.33 --> 781.1600000000001
Flat Earth just not constantly repeat

779.54 --> 784.55
the misunderstandings even though we

781.16 --> 789.26
constantly then tell them no that's not

784.55 --> 792.3199999999999
our model or our assumption or you just

789.26 --> 797.6
made something ridiculous that like a

792.32 --> 799.5500000000001
flood earth calculator that also lacks

797.6 --> 805.16
perspective that kind of nonsense that's

799.55 --> 808.06
just you know so the whole situation is

805.16 --> 808.06
not symmetrical

809.99 --> 813.2
[Music]

817.25 --> 819.939
all right

821.95 --> 828.07
look Rach nurse Stefan huh listen

825.07 --> 829.99
Coriolis is a side effect it'll work

828.07 --> 832.63
whenever there's a reference frame that

829.99 --> 835.41
are different from one another in motion

832.63 --> 835.41
okay

841.34 --> 847.46
well a lot of them are Ragnar Stefan

844.04 --> 853.13
audition but most of them are literally

847.46 --> 856.1600000000001
just not really capable of handling the

853.13 --> 860.51
sheer complexity and size of it all and

856.16 --> 864.8
the and the built-in warfare against us

860.51 --> 868.61
by basically the opponent that's been

864.8 --> 870.17
planned it's their thing they're not

868.61 --> 873.6800000000001
prepared to handle it and they're easily

870.17 --> 876.0799999999999
deviated so they will drop in some kind

873.68 --> 878.2099999999999
of hole somewhere so like Oh disk I'm a

876.08 --> 882.2900000000001
disco oh good yeah I'm good just kind of

878.21 --> 884.27
accept that or they're just sick of the

882.29 --> 886.6999999999999
whole thing and then start wandering off

884.27 --> 888.62
doing their weird own thing and

886.7 --> 889.82
everybody's like okay I don't even

888.62 --> 892.49
understand what he's talking about

889.82 --> 900.0200000000001
anymore so it's all over the place

892.49 --> 903.44
really but there are still a sizable

900.02 --> 906.05
amount of individuals that most of them

903.44 --> 909.1700000000001
even do have very stable jobs or work

906.05 --> 914.0889999999999
for themselves or whatever like to be

909.17 --> 916.37
one of those eventually hmm that that

914.089 --> 921.2600000000001
are also just very sharp that learn a

916.37 --> 924.65
lot that have managed to keep their

921.26 --> 928.85
their as in their sanity about in the

924.65 --> 933.23
face of everything that are very sharp

928.85 --> 936.71
as to the details like the word details

933.23 --> 940.45
or the like the trickery the opponent's

936.71 --> 940.45
view is they're very aware of it all

943.62 --> 951.87
so yeah and that's the difference

955.56 --> 961.319
yeah Ragnar Stefan Alderson if there is

958.8 --> 964.6099999999999
something moving on the earth in

961.319 --> 969.99
relation to the earth there will be

964.61 --> 973.139
Coriolis effects visible in yeah of

969.99 --> 974.4590000000001
course it doesn't really matter where it

973.139 --> 976.23
is as long as there are two different

974.459 --> 978.5889999999999
reference frame there will be Coriolis

976.23 --> 978.589
effect

989.439 --> 992.549
are you done now

996.39 --> 1006.12
[Music]

999.18 --> 1009.77
no no it doesn't I can't prove that what

1006.12 --> 1009.77
sir all this miss you don't know that

1010.76 --> 1016.83
yeah what bullet after you ever done it

1014.27 --> 1019.9499999999999
have you ever fired a bullet and

1016.83 --> 1023.76
experienced it was subjected to coriolis

1019.95 --> 1027.3
Ragnar Stefan Alison or are you just

1023.76 --> 1030.11
really in love with that stupid cowboy

1027.3 --> 1030.11
story

1061.9 --> 1066.95
show what

1063.87 --> 1066.9499999999998
[Music]

1068.85 --> 1075.029
yeah you can demonstrate it as much as

1072.539 --> 1078.96
you like just take a wind still day and

1075.029 --> 1082.32
shooting it straight upwards just keep

1078.96 --> 1086.539
standing there if you really believe in

1082.32 --> 1086.539
Coriolis effect it'll be perfectly safe

1100.86 --> 1103.61
yeah

1105.179 --> 1112.169
look Ragnar Stefan Alison you look if

1109.2 --> 1114.479
you want to demonstrate the bullets do

1112.169 --> 1119.3390000000002
the Coriolis thing go right ahead I'm

1114.479 --> 1121.3790000000001
not gonna sign any verbal contracts as

1119.339 --> 1123.479
to how to respond to whatever you're

1121.379 --> 1126.019
going to be doing I don't even know who

1123.479 --> 1129.239
you are anymore I think you're probably

1126.019 --> 1131.58
very susceptible to applying trickery at

1129.239 --> 1133.6490000000001
this point since you seem to be much

1131.58 --> 1136.7289999999998
more fanatical about all this nonsense

1133.649 --> 1139.889
that I originally thought you would I

1136.729 --> 1142.1090000000002
thought you were actually kind of a

1139.889 --> 1145.039
sensible flat earther but turned out to

1142.109 --> 1145.039
be not the case

1151.71 --> 1159.69
so go ahead proof your Coriolis effect

1155.88 --> 1161.7
on the bullet go ahead it's not going to

1159.69 --> 1164.93
be a link to some kind of studio

1161.7 --> 1168.18
produced or back to whatever financed

1164.93 --> 1173.0600000000002
[ __ ] program proving it you're gonna

1168.18 --> 1173.0600000000002
have to do it yourself live

1176.0 --> 1179.109
[Music]

1180.15 --> 1186.1200000000001
yeah well keep on looking and until

1183.6 --> 1192.1399999999999
you've actually found it maybe you might

1186.12 --> 1192.1399999999999
want to hold back on the claims okay

1192.74 --> 1198.059
it's very silly to buy into a story if

1196.08 --> 1204.6
you haven't haven't actually confirmed

1198.059 --> 1208.11
it yourself in some way unless it's

1204.6 --> 1211.799
something that you have personal reason

1208.11 --> 1216.029
to think has a good chance it could be

1211.799 --> 1218.73
real a real good well thought out reason

1216.029 --> 1220.98
for it and then you could say that like

1218.73 --> 1222.8990000000001
yeah I think then I don't know for sure

1220.98 --> 1225.99
but I think there is a good chance that

1222.899 --> 1228.84
this is real and I'm I'm up for testing

1225.99 --> 1232.89
it like my rectangular looping model

1228.84 --> 1233.51
concept for this realm very clear about

1232.89 --> 1236.6100000000001
that

1233.51 --> 1240.929
but don't just go out and say yeah it is

1236.61 --> 1243.36
that it has to be no it's just hey look

1240.929 --> 1245.279
there's some kind of thing something

1243.36 --> 1249.33
that was measured or whatever something

1245.279 --> 1253.289
that was figured out and then I reflect

1249.33 --> 1255.99
that on my concept I think wait that's

1253.289 --> 1257.61
that could really fit perfectly in it

1255.99 --> 1260.34
and then I'll mention it look it fits

1257.61 --> 1262.77
perfectly that doesn't mean that I

1260.34 --> 1264.51
claimed yeah it must I am right see

1262.77 --> 1266.8799999999999
another proof that I'm right I don't

1264.51 --> 1271.02
even talk like that that's the

1266.88 --> 1273.24
difference yeah it is a claim it is your

1271.02 --> 1276.6299999999999
claim you are the one claiming that

1273.24 --> 1278.88
bullets are subjected to Coriolis you're

1276.63 --> 1283.8300000000002
the you're the one claiming that regular

1278.88 --> 1286.89
Stephon Alderson yeah I don't really

1283.83 --> 1290.539
care for your supposed motivations about

1286.89 --> 1290.539
it you're the one making the claim

1296.35 --> 1300.58
- go ahead do it

1305.43 --> 1312.28
or you could go with other YouTube

1308.35 --> 1314.35
videos that say through military sources

1312.28 --> 1316.78
that it's not true whatever you want to

1314.35 --> 1318.1599999999999
believe but if you really want to know

1316.78 --> 1321.43
then you're gonna have to test it

1318.16 --> 1324.8500000000001
yourself that's how it really works I'm

1321.43 --> 1328.69
satisfied in understanding that it's

1324.85 --> 1331.4499999999998
extremely unlikely or rather 0% chance

1328.69 --> 1333.76
that it's the case because the earth is

1331.45 --> 1335.47
not spinning because if it were then

1333.76 --> 1339.76
everything would be subjected to

1335.47 --> 1342.6100000000001
Coriolis and not just bullets flight

1339.76 --> 1344.44
times would be things hovering in the

1342.61 --> 1346.9599999999998
high altitude would be there would be a

1344.44 --> 1349.48
constant one way direction air stream

1346.96 --> 1351.97
that would never end it might go a

1349.48 --> 1354.01
little bit faster or a slightly sore but

1351.97 --> 1356.6200000000001
it would always be going in that one

1354.01 --> 1359.35
direction the higher the altitude the

1356.62 --> 1363.6699999999998
harder it goes and I don't think it's

1359.35 --> 1367.6499999999999
they're all these super high balloon

1363.67 --> 1371.98
footage that's they were not drifting

1367.65 --> 1374.3200000000002
not that much you know not more than

1371.98 --> 1381.72
just the regular wind that was at ground

1374.32 --> 1386.08
level so I have no reason to believe

1381.72 --> 1388.21
from any direction that bullets would be

1386.08 --> 1391.87
subjected to Coriolis effect because

1388.21 --> 1393.96
I've heard the tall tales from the

1391.87 --> 1398.4699999999998
suppose that sniper saying that they did

1393.96 --> 1399.8500000000001
that they told other people with it

1398.47 --> 1401.74
which i think is probably kind of like a

1399.85 --> 1407.26
bragging move or something that they do

1401.74 --> 1411.28
that just to see I don't know and and

1407.26 --> 1416.3799999999999
people that basically said and explained

1411.28 --> 1418.96
in detail that they don't so putting all

1416.38 --> 1422.23
of that together I have no reason to

1418.96 --> 1425.14
believe whatsoever that bullets fired

1422.23 --> 1427.98
from guns would be subjected to the

1425.14 --> 1427.98
Coriolis effect

1431.01 --> 1440.83
yeah okay

1433.99 --> 1448.33
yeah this is really annoying this is

1440.83 --> 1458.9499999999998
where things go wrong you're turning

1448.33 --> 1460.87
into a debaters troll you've you've

1458.95 --> 1462.55
probably been hanging around in this car

1460.87 --> 1469.0
too long because that's exactly what

1462.55 --> 1470.68
happens to people that do that turn into

1469.0 --> 1476.94
those trolls you see at the Flat Earth

1470.68 --> 1476.94
debates drones

1503.36 --> 1512.8899999999999
oh my god spare room music that is total

1509.03 --> 1517.37
[ __ ] missiles have their own

1512.89 --> 1522.14
propelling coordination system they're

1517.37 --> 1526.9399999999998
gonna fly whatever path they like it's

1522.14 --> 1529.16
nonsense and they don't fly faster in

1526.94 --> 1532.81
one direction as the other as well at

1529.16 --> 1539.69
high altitude that is just a blatant lie

1532.81 --> 1543.58
doesn't do that so new no Coriolis

1539.69 --> 1543.5800000000002
effect [ __ ]

1549.74 --> 1557.39
[Music]

1554.77 --> 1559.61
alright are you you're gonna keep on

1557.39 --> 1562.01
moving the bar right well I've heard

1559.61 --> 1564.4399999999998
testimony through mark sergeant that

1562.01 --> 1567.44
long-range artillery does not account

1564.44 --> 1568.93
for Coriolis so that's really nice nice

1567.44 --> 1575.71
Bluff there

1568.93 --> 1575.71
no no Coriolis none whatsoever

1576.73 --> 1580.109
[Music]

1588.54 --> 1593.75
yeah sure he did sure he did

1598.84 --> 1603.6399999999999
are you telling me you're you were in

1601.45 --> 1609.88
the Falkland Wars their spare room music

1603.64 --> 1612.43
is that what you're saying there or did

1609.88 --> 1615.2800000000002
somebody in the [ __ ] wars tell you a

1612.43 --> 1619.0
story about how they use choreo is just

1615.28 --> 1621.73
like the example I just gave to the tall

1619.0 --> 1627.26
tales or are you one of these tall tale

1621.73 --> 1630.319
tellers you get a special contract

1627.26 --> 1630.319
[Music]

1633.4 --> 1639.2800000000002
right no not you so you don't know you

1637.16 --> 1642.74
just believe the tall tale while

1639.28 --> 1645.22
congratulations dumbass you're not the

1642.74 --> 1645.22
only one

1648.31 --> 1651.52
[Music]

1657.24 --> 1659.75
right

1669.83 --> 1695.83
let's see if I can get Riley in here I'm

1673.52 --> 1701.17
gonna try it's probably busy or he know

1695.83 --> 1705.74
Nathan didn't throw out a panel link yet

1701.17 --> 1708.4
right oh he just did that okay all

1705.74 --> 1708.4
righty then

1711.08 --> 1714.3
[Music]

1721.83 --> 1727.32
I might have Joe Kovacs I got a lot of

1724.65 --> 1727.95
PDFs on my computer but they're all over

1727.32 --> 1731.9099999999999
the place

1727.95 --> 1735.72
I don't really care to to check but I do

1731.91 --> 1738.44
remember having looked into it being on

1735.72 --> 1741.1200000000001
screen I don't know if I was the one

1738.44 --> 1743.31
looking at it or that it was part of the

1741.12 --> 1745.11
presentation but I remember there's no

1743.31 --> 1750.3799999999999
Coriolis effect in the manuals I've

1745.11 --> 1750.3799999999999
never seen Coriolis effect in manuals

1759.38 --> 1766.19
yeah well for somebody that's looking

1762.169 --> 1768.14
for truth for answers you're you're

1766.19 --> 1773.1200000000001
asking all kinds of manipulative

1768.14 --> 1775.8200000000002
nonsense and you're not listening you're

1773.12 --> 1780.9189999999999
not actually responding to when I'm

1775.82 --> 1784.1
directly addressing you so yeah we're

1780.919 --> 1787.49
not in the same boat because you're just

1784.1 --> 1796.1589999999999
spouting nonsense at this point it's not

1787.49 --> 1798.919
the truth you know you can try to look

1796.159 --> 1801.3200000000002
for the truth but in order to do that

1798.919 --> 1804.2
you gotta overcome the obstacles when

1801.32 --> 1809.45
you hit them in this case the obstacle

1804.2 --> 1811.69
being there is no Coriolis effect if you

1809.45 --> 1814.88
understand what the Coriolis effect is

1811.69 --> 1820.8400000000001
then you know there is no Coriolis

1814.88 --> 1825.7890000000002
effect over the earth from some presumed

1820.84 --> 1825.789
spin as it were none of it

1835.54 --> 1841.02
they do truth Trish Blythe that's

1838.69 --> 1841.02
hilarious

1843.07 --> 1847.1689999999999
would like to see how that actually

1844.87 --> 1847.1689999999999
works

1853.69 --> 1858.45
all right yeah and you were bad and

1864.14 --> 1867.249
[Music]

1892.7 --> 1895.45
hmm

1896.18 --> 1900.98
right

1898.76 --> 1904.97
I think that is what I heard as well

1900.98 --> 1907.309
step that they did find that it was in

1904.97 --> 1912.47
there but that literally everybody

1907.309 --> 1916.1299999999999
ignores it and that when superiors are

1912.47 --> 1920.59
asked about it they also tell ya the

1916.13 --> 1920.5900000000001
operators to ignore it and correct

1936.69 --> 1940.6090000000002

[Music]

1975.08 --> 1982.009
oh well yeah well Ragnar Stefan

1977.989 --> 1984.529
Halverson everywhere I go they say there

1982.009 --> 1986.269
is manmade climate change I don't go and

1984.529 --> 1990.549
just believing that because it said

1986.269 --> 1994.8990000000001
everywhere ok because I'm not a dumbass

1990.549 --> 1998.499
so maybe you should stop listening to

1994.899 --> 2001.36
what has been figured out to be nonsense

1998.499 --> 2002.8890000000001
use some critical thinking here just

2001.36 --> 2005.6999999999998
because it's said everywhere doesn't

2002.889 --> 2005.6999999999998
mean that it's true

2016.29 --> 2022.43
you know get out

2064.39 --> 2069.77
yeah it's nice to know that most of

2067.64 --> 2075.44
these trolls is simply one person with a

2069.77 --> 2078.65
lot of counts just so you know they got

2075.44 --> 2082.07
a whole spectrum of nonsense ready to

2078.65 --> 2085.52
input and disrupt they don't like it

2082.07 --> 2087.8
when somebody's just not being flexible

2085.52 --> 2092.24
enough not allowing and entertaining

2087.8 --> 2095.05
enough corrupted [ __ ] ha

2092.24 --> 2095.0499999999997
hey Randy

2127.99 --> 2137.41
No all right Riley may want to come on

2133.18 --> 2140.16
that's fun I was having a chat with QE I

2137.41 --> 2140.16
just said

2146.79 --> 2152.2
yeah now you're just reversing the

2149.23 --> 2153.4900000000002
burden of proof stop stop subjecting me

2152.2 --> 2157.71
to this nonsense

2153.49 --> 2157.7099999999996
please Ragnar Steffen Alderson

2161.89 --> 2166.9
where can you see Coriolis is not on

2164.56 --> 2169.7799999999997
earth well how about everywhere it's not

2166.9 --> 2171.36
there it's not Coriolis it's not an

2169.78 --> 2174.2200000000003
apparent deflection

2171.36 --> 2177.55
okay there's turbulence going on oh yeah

2174.22 --> 2182.1899999999996
there's wind streams going on sure but

2177.55 --> 2185.2000000000003
they do not consist with a one-way

2182.19 --> 2187.12
rapidly over a height-increasing stream

2185.2 --> 2188.9199999999996
that's not there and that should be if

2187.12 --> 2193.27
if the earth were a spinning ball and

2188.92 --> 2195.07
it's not so yeah there's wind go going

2193.27 --> 2196.72
all over the place yeah the the earth is

2195.07 --> 2199.6600000000003
being subjected to heat changing the

2196.72 --> 2203.1699999999996
pressures causing a constant shift as

2199.66 --> 2205.3599999999997
where they light hits the earth changes

2203.17 --> 2208.54
in its location constantly so it's

2205.36 --> 2212.04
moving around like a big spoon stirring

2208.54 --> 2215.92
in that air okay

2212.04 --> 2219.7
but that's something that's happening

2215.92 --> 2221.35
because of the heat mostly that's what's

2219.7 --> 2227.23
causing the motion that's what's causing

2221.35 --> 2234.25
the turbulence it's not an object being

2227.23 --> 2238.11
spinned within a medium I just told you

2234.25 --> 2240.28
that joke of X it's all about heat heat

2238.11 --> 2242.77
changing of the pressures and the

2240.28 --> 2249.7200000000003
moisture and then turbulence sets in it

2242.77 --> 2254.79
just happens with large bodies of

2249.72 --> 2260.02
temperature and density differentiating

2254.79 --> 2264.22
gases just move past one another there

2260.02 --> 2265.81
will be like ya counter motions and all

2264.22 --> 2268.18
that it's very complex how that all

2265.81 --> 2270.64
works out and then turbulence patterns

2268.18 --> 2273.0299999999997
start arrived just happens that's what

2270.64 --> 2273.0299999999997
happens

2284.26 --> 2290.34
okay

2286.93 --> 2290.3399999999997
still coming through yeah

2292.0 --> 2295.89
Oh what

2308.099 --> 2310.13
Oh

2310.56 --> 2318.56
my Chad is broken maybe no okay

2326.15 --> 2331.4900000000002
we have they do the Trish Blythe I know

2328.3 --> 2335.48
they've been doing it for years it's the

2331.49 --> 2337.93
same nonsense I got three years ago so

2335.48 --> 2337.93
yeah

2342.63 --> 2348.83
there's just more of it just more trolls

2346.2 --> 2348.83
that's all

2388.589 --> 2394.2889999999998
right Trish Blythe I don't know paid for

2392.819 --> 2397.41
the music I think that they're just

2394.289 --> 2400.079
fanatical I think most of these trolls

2397.41 --> 2402.029
are just people that just can't handle

2400.079 --> 2405.029
Flat Earth is going on

2402.029 --> 2407.13
it drives them nuts and they retreating

2405.029 --> 2409.499
the shadows like goblins and then set

2407.13 --> 2413.819
out their sock accounts through the

2409.499 --> 2421.3689999999997
internet to just bother to basically act

2413.819 --> 2424.2889999999998
out try to find a weakness and just

2421.369 --> 2426.809
rubbing as much salt in wounds and

2424.289 --> 2429.6600000000003
whatever they can do to get it out of

2426.809 --> 2432.539
the way so I really don't think they're

2429.66 --> 2436.859
even paid to do it it's just built in

2432.539 --> 2438.809
the system the psychological needs for

2436.859 --> 2443.16
them their addiction to the globe

2438.809 --> 2445.1090000000004
religion has rooted so deeply in

2443.16 --> 2447.18
everything they've done in everything

2445.109 --> 2451.499
every decision they made they just can't

2447.18 --> 2454.3089999999997
get over it so they have to double down

2451.499 --> 2454.3089999999997
no matter the cost

2472.8 --> 2475.5800000000004

2478.15 --> 2481.65

yeah closer to or the answers I am I am

2599.349 --> 2605.319
record Stefan Alderson there is no

2601.989 --> 2609.969
Coriolis effects you were right

2605.319 --> 2615.549
to approach me but now you need to

2609.969 --> 2618.099
actually accept doesn't matter how many

2615.549 --> 2620.069
wise men you ask the same question if

2618.099 --> 2624.119
you're not going to accept their answer

2620.069 --> 2624.119
doesn't matter who you ask

2630.17 --> 2638.84
I've tried to explain it so elaborately

2635.09 --> 2638.84
what more do you want

yeah what they love to do I have a bowl

2674.07 --> 2678.57
of water out there for them and then

2676.41 --> 2681.66
sometimes I lay out bread and I usually

2678.57 --> 2684.81
just make soup out of it take the bread

2681.66 --> 2689.52
put it in the bowl soak it and then eat

2684.81 --> 2693.71
it I think they got most of it already

2689.52 --> 2693.71
and probably doesn't like being filmed

2693.89 --> 2700.4
they really know when somebody's looking

2696.3 --> 2700.4
whether it's a camera or a person

2713.13 --> 2716.25

I'm gonna show up yeah for me perfectly

2878.79 --> 2886.77

2882.03 --> 2889.9500000000003
first ten minutes to do my thing and and

2886.77 --> 2892.19

2928.949 --> 2934.609
on the debates and he yeah I'm presuming

2931.709 --> 2934.609
he's a human being

2954.0 --> 2959.61
Thursday's okay cool sure

2967.9 --> 2970.859
hmm

2973.18 --> 2981.72
yeah yeah I've checked it out was pretty

2979.48 --> 2981.72
cool

2989.48 --> 2994.79
[Music]

2992.39 --> 2997.9
Siri you've got some serious baller

2994.79 --> 3002.82
syndrome there Iraq no Stephanie listen

2997.9 --> 3002.82
why do you keep on asking the same stuff

3004.68 --> 3010.87
why do you want answers to the question

3008.5 --> 3016.39
that's already pretty much been answered

3010.87 --> 3018.16
from every angle that we can the only

3016.39 --> 3022.66
thing left for you to do is to actually

3018.16 --> 3026.19
figure it out physically yourself why do

3022.66 --> 3026.19
you keep on asking others

3037.21 --> 3040.2690000000002
[Music]

3047.5 --> 3055.05
yeah yep crow is making bits

3060.9 --> 3067.7000000000003
and the Magpies are squabbling as usual

3104.98 --> 3111.07
yeah sorry I can spend quite some time

3109.03 --> 3116.2000000000003
looking at that stuff I find it very

3111.07 --> 3119.4
amusing yeah make a roof garden I know

3116.2 --> 3121.96
I've definitely thought about that but

3119.4 --> 3125.4700000000003
for starters I don't have the money for

3121.96 --> 3128.29
it and second off it's not like I walk

3125.47 --> 3133.1189999999997
there but it's officially not really my

3128.29 --> 3136.92
place so I don't know I could get into

3133.119 --> 3136.92
trouble for that I don't really want to

3150.23 --> 3160.579
look oh and they're awfully we're all

3158.119 --> 3166.79
close up to me until I grab the camera

3160.579 --> 3173.69
and then they'll let anyway I think I'm

3166.79 --> 3177.29
gonna round out to show I yeah there

3173.69 --> 3180.14
were just subjects and watching Vaughn

3177.29 --> 3186.17
Benjamin again it was pretty cool

3180.14 --> 3190.5499999999997
oh yeah yeah there's this new series on

3186.17 --> 3195.23
Netflix woo new series and it's of

3190.55 --> 3197.0
course been handled by the dark ones as

3195.23 --> 3199.07
well so there is shitty things about it

3197.0 --> 3202.88
but yeah there's a new series from Dark

3199.07 --> 3205.4300000000003
Crystal apparently and oh god like the

3202.88 --> 3208.19
literally the first shot like oh let

3205.43 --> 3212.2999999999997
it's your space no this world is your

3208.19 --> 3217.18
planet ah just instant allergic reaction

3212.3 --> 3220.19
just I had to shut it off no terrible

3217.18 --> 3223.43
wasn't necessary but after that point

3220.19 --> 3226.52
they kind of drop it sort off they also

3223.43 --> 3230.5
just yeah it officially doesn't get

3226.52 --> 3234.71
involved as much and the visuals were

3230.5 --> 3237.53
pretty damn accurately reflecting the

3234.71 --> 3241.2200000000003
original movie was fascinating there was

3237.53 --> 3245.1800000000003
a lot of CGI involved probably but look

3241.22 --> 3248.99
very much like the old style and that

3245.18 --> 3251.24
was interesting it's kind of a dark

3248.99 --> 3254.75
story though it's like the the prequel

3251.24 --> 3258.0789999999997
to what happened with the whole gelfling

3254.75 --> 3261.13
empires or well these taxis and the Golf

3258.079 --> 3264.05
Links and how that all went wrong and

3261.13 --> 3270.01
it's pretty freaky because it's also

3264.05 --> 3273.349
about imperial mind control it's it was

3270.01 --> 3275.5690000000004
surprisingly interesting in its plot now

3273.349 --> 3277.819
not that I seen it all right yeah now

3275.569 --> 3282.349
that you mention it I vote that was just

3277.819 --> 3284.719
the first episode very concentrated

3282.349 --> 3292.6400000000003
first episode really did feel like half

3284.719 --> 3294.7690000000002
a movie so I don't know it was kind of

3292.64 --> 3300.3689999999997
entertaining it's his own thing oh yeah

3294.769 --> 3304.279
I finished watching Game of Thrones was

3300.369 --> 3308.69
yeah as I thought it was probably gonna

3304.279 --> 3315.369
be like that have my opinions about it

3308.69 --> 3315.369
but yeah everybody does of course I

3316.119 --> 3323.6600000000003
don't know I in a way because of the

3319.69 --> 3326.239
just the intensity of it all it almost

3323.66 --> 3329.089
felt anti-climactic that there were so

3326.239 --> 3335.089
many likeable people still left over

3329.089 --> 3337.549
because you know what I mean I think

3335.089 --> 3340.489
that a lot of people were literally

3337.549 --> 3344.809
expecting like okay there's just gonna

3340.489 --> 3346.369
be like three people left and of course

3344.809 --> 3349.0690000000004
Tyrion has to be one of these people

3346.369 --> 3351.259
because he would at least be capable of

3349.069 --> 3355.5389999999998
feeling really really shitty about it

3351.259 --> 3357.44
all and that kind of did still work out

3355.539 --> 3361.579
sorry if that's his foiler

3357.44 --> 3369.079
but as for the rest I don't know it was

3361.579 --> 3371.17
like a we it was weird it wasn't I don't

3369.079 --> 3371.17
know

3372.99 --> 3378.3399999999997
you could almost say like it softened up

3376.03 --> 3382.48
a little why I am reflecting to the the

3378.34 --> 3383.9500000000003
the whole destroying the city you know

3382.48 --> 3390.19
let's inhabitants which was of course

3383.95 --> 3397.6
just disgusting but besides that the

3390.19 --> 3399.94
characters themselves you know I don't

3397.6 --> 3403.86
know it's it's so like at this point

3399.94 --> 3406.03
it's been so intense and so opinionated

3403.86 --> 3408.84
with people were like who they're

3406.03 --> 3412.6000000000004
rooting for for whatever reason that

3408.84 --> 3415.63
it's that we would like I can't even

3412.6 --> 3419.08
figure out in my mind like how would you

3415.63 --> 3422.71
have made it into a more logical or

3419.08 --> 3428.619
satisfying ending so I I don't know

3422.71 --> 3430.15
maybe there's gonna be there poof what

3428.619 --> 3433.2000000000003
am I talking maybe there's already like

3430.15 --> 3435.82
hundreds of fanfiction alternative

3433.2 --> 3439.5099999999998
designs by people that are just how

3435.82 --> 3443.4700000000003
great Joey did it overall I know maybe

3439.51 --> 3445.2700000000004
that's already out there I'm not really

3443.47 --> 3449.64
that much of a fan really but I do

3445.27 --> 3449.64
respect the quality of the series

3454.12 --> 3465.67
I thought gameofthrones went three

3458.92 --> 3469.8
episodes too alone yes actually yes in a

3465.67 --> 3473.61
way I kind of agree with that like the

3469.8 --> 3476.2000000000003
but then it would have been so much like

3473.61 --> 3483.34
the end of The Lord of the Rings almost

3476.2 --> 3485.71
I don't know none no no no but it was

3483.34 --> 3489.6400000000003
just so like the bat battle was pretty

3485.71 --> 3494.62
brutal but even at that battle I was

3489.64 --> 3497.71
like severely surprised already what was

3494.62 --> 3501.0099999999998
happening that like okay freakin undead

3497.71 --> 3502.84
army they were so they were terrifying

3501.01 --> 3505.1200000000003
they were all running and [ __ ] while you

3502.84 --> 3507.2200000000003
already know if you've seen the season

3505.12 --> 3508.87
before that sorry I'm keeping on talking

3507.22 --> 3511.75
about this now for when I completely

3508.87 --> 3514.21
forgot that I even saw this anyway at

3511.75 --> 3519.82
least I got mostly into Flat Earth this

3514.21 --> 3521.92
early bird but I was surprised with how

3519.82 --> 3525.4300000000003
many survive because she would literally

3521.92 --> 3528.64
see them diving in a group of undead and

3525.43 --> 3532.99
then being piled on and so what he's

3528.64 --> 3534.94
dead like and then afterward like only a

3532.99 --> 3536.77
few people had died and they got a

3534.94 --> 3539.41
dramatic death but the others were like

3536.77 --> 3543.06
no way that doesn't make a sense why did

3539.41 --> 3545.41
it survive that was kind of weird it was

3543.06 --> 3548.92
sounds harsh or the kind of off-putting

3545.41 --> 3554.0099999999998
in a way that like then they should have

3548.92 --> 3556.75
not done that they should have somehow

3554.01 --> 3562.26
that's something slightly different I

3556.75 --> 3567.07
don't know but it was kind of weird how

3562.26 --> 3570.67
that felt off already still was really

3567.07 --> 3573.34
fascinating situation like it was pretty

3570.67 --> 3576.25
yeah was like well big rush it was

3573.34 --> 3579.58
really like a helms deep of Game of

3576.25 --> 3581.82
Thrones in its own way it was pretty

3579.58 --> 3581.8199999999997
cool

3583.79 --> 3590.4
so like the battle itself how it looked

3586.98 --> 3592.32
how it went that was I thought that was

3590.4 --> 3593.82
very well done it's just a couple of

3592.32 --> 3596.9100000000003
details that are in retrospect I'm like

3593.82 --> 3598.76
what they survived what that was just

3596.91 --> 3601.41
weird

3598.76 --> 3602.2700000000004
like how did they freaking survive that

3601.41 --> 3605.8199999999997
anyway

3602.27 --> 3614.82
Game of Thrones that was that it was

3605.82 --> 3616.8900000000003
cool and I don't know that was that

3614.82 --> 3620.42
that's how it feels I don't really see

3616.89 --> 3623.3399999999997
any need for continuation after this

3620.42 --> 3627.81
maybe they could do like sort of a weird

3623.34 --> 3629.9700000000003
addendum like a last the Lost season

3627.81 --> 3632.2799999999997
kind of thing so what happened with the

3629.97 --> 3633.93
characters afterward maybe they'll do

3632.28 --> 3636.0600000000004
something like that because people keep

3633.93 --> 3639.2999999999997
on crying oh please don't be the end

3636.06 --> 3642.84
please we want more you know they could

3639.3 --> 3646.17
do that but other than that now the the

3642.84 --> 3649.9500000000003
story of the host is definitely finished
