yeah whatever stallion yeah yeah

296.879 --> 300.949
uh yeah happy birthday to me today

308.979 --> 315.61
I think I'm probably gonna spend most of

312.4 --> 319.44899999999996
the day just to myself and try to enjoy

315.61 --> 323.259
this nice weather and take it - take it

319.449 --> 324.13
easy because yesterday was not a very

323.259 --> 326.099
nice day

324.13 --> 330.099
[Music]

326.099 --> 332.289
well like it didn't really be yeah the

330.099 --> 336.55
whole issue again on Nathan's show it

332.289 --> 343.96
just it was kind of similar to Friday

336.55 --> 347.02000000000004
and I yeah yeah it was kind of odd

343.96 --> 349.27
because it was I was about to go and do

347.02 --> 352.75
my newspaper around but I thought okay

349.27 --> 355.44899999999996
why I have I've not really spoken up at

352.75 --> 361.63
all I've kept to myself and Nathan was

355.449 --> 364.03000000000003
very added so I thought okay he made the

361.63 --> 365.949
point really completely nobody really

364.03 --> 369.669
interrupted him I didn't interrupt maybe

365.949 --> 370.24
some others and then when he was kind of

369.669 --> 372.75
finished

370.24 --> 375.94
I was blatantly officer thought okay

372.75 --> 379.72
well I can actually answer his question

375.94 --> 384.49
without him letting it it used it as a

379.72 --> 388.24
straw man I know how to do it but Nathan

384.49 --> 390.969
just didn't like it and he didn't say

388.24 --> 393.07
like no let's just let this silence

390.969 --> 396.969
remain or whatever no he looked

393.07 --> 401.44
completely lost it towards me and just

396.969 --> 403.479
complains first that I don't speak up

401.44 --> 406.3
and like since when is that a problem

403.479 --> 408.449
you know usually I get complaints that I

406.3 --> 412.33
just keep on talking and talking

408.449 --> 414.55
now shut up for a while and then it's a

412.33 --> 420.099
problem when I speak up like what is the

414.55 --> 423.37
issue there I I it seems so overblown

420.099 --> 426.789
and I yeah I was kind of flustered yeah

423.37 --> 429.52
and then 10th man proceeds to take

426.789 --> 432.669
another dump on top of that so I thought

429.52 --> 434.289
like yeah screw this I'm not gonna like

432.669 --> 439.45
I don't even know how to respond to that

434.289 --> 445.31
it's such absurd thing to say to my face

439.45 --> 447.11
so I thought no okay you know then then

445.31 --> 452.57
I'll take my business somewhere else if

447.11 --> 454.79
I'm not appreciated here so I'm just

452.57 --> 458.78
gonna stick to my own show for a while

454.79 --> 467.45000000000005
and see whatever else is going down and

458.78 --> 471.21999999999997
who knows where I may join in but that's

467.45 --> 471.21999999999997
been you know what's happening for

477.09 --> 485.15999999999997
I don't know Preston Parker look I want

480.72 --> 489.3
to take it easy today but I already feel

485.16 --> 491.40000000000003
like getting all into baller territory

489.3 --> 498.93
at the moment you know what I mean

491.4 --> 500.32
like it's my birthday well maybe maybe

498.93 --> 503.6
eventually

500.32 --> 503.59999999999997
[Music]

508.62 --> 515.909
while Flat Earth I'll see Jesus yes

510.93 --> 521.88
planning at times Nathan isn't a big can

515.909 --> 522.33
be extremely eloquent and I don't know

521.88 --> 528.57
man

522.33 --> 531.029
you know what is it a month before this

528.57 --> 532.86
last week pretty much Nathan's been

531.029 --> 535.89
praising the hell out of me dude calling

532.86 --> 539.37
me ace everywhere no it's like it's like

535.89 --> 544.56
okay okay you know I don't know exactly

539.37 --> 550.41
what I did to deserve that it appreciate

544.56 --> 554.9399999999999
it but now suddenly just you've switched

550.41 --> 556.62
that around and yeah don't I don't even

554.94 --> 557.94
if he switched it I don't know what's

556.62 --> 563.24
going on anymore

557.94 --> 563.24
he's just just lashing out too much

574.21 --> 586.12
yeah Oh more colored questions do need

579.13 --> 589.709
to be asked and yeah you know I can be

586.12 --> 592.8100000000001
very patient wait very long and in a way

589.709 --> 594.6099999999999
there's something yeah there is like

592.81 --> 598.5
this weird little trick that I kind of

594.61 --> 600.94
learn as a kid it's it's super intuitive

598.5 --> 605.56
if somebody doesn't want to answer a

600.94 --> 607.089
question then you can clewd can conclude

605.56 --> 609.91
that they have something to hide but you

607.089 --> 612.899
don't necessarily know what that is but

609.91 --> 617.1999999999999
if you just study them very carefully

612.899 --> 620.32
over a long time certain hints will

617.2 --> 627.22
start to drop you get to know people

620.32 --> 630.7
because in tip and that is how I figure

627.22 --> 635.95
out what are doubt points that's how I

630.7 --> 637.72
basically define from qyy that because

635.95 --> 640.6600000000001
that is what I've been doing like saying

637.72 --> 642.99
like this is probably why that's good

640.66 --> 647.4699999999999
yeah that's basically divining is is

642.99 --> 650.83
motivations right but I base that on on

647.47 --> 653.0500000000001
what I do and figuring it out this issue

650.83 --> 656.529
what is the most likely it is all about

653.05 --> 659.68
likelihoods versus attitudes and what

656.529 --> 662.47
excludes certain things because

659.68 --> 667.3499999999999
attitudes is super complex its ethereal

662.47 --> 667.35
it's hard to describe but attempted it

670.83 --> 673.9290000000001
[Music]

677.25 --> 684.42
ha Thank You Adam is that the video you

681.87 --> 691.439
posted in the early bird chat yeah that

684.42 --> 694.1289999999999
was hilarious at the Domini base now

691.439 --> 694.129
that was so funny

702.779 --> 712.899
it's so funny since since I stumbled

707.29 --> 715.87
upon Davey's 504 now I'm just I hate it

712.899 --> 717.97
the musical mind itself funny on works

715.87 --> 721.0
because now I listen to a lot of music

717.97 --> 725.2900000000001
usually electronic and now because of

721.0 --> 730.18
Navy I'm certainly just hearing all the

725.29 --> 732.43
bass parties it's like well that's the

730.18 --> 734.5889999999999
bass hey that's the it's so funny how

732.43 --> 737.05
that works it's just it changes the

734.589 --> 738.759
entire hang of the things it's anyway

737.05 --> 742.4799999999999
yeah I'm going for right with that and

738.759 --> 745.8100000000001
I'm really enjoying it I'm not trying to

742.48 --> 749.29
get all over hyped up about it because I

745.81 --> 750.04
know it's probably just a hype for me

749.29 --> 754.48
right now

750.04 --> 756.67
I do love music and I do find sense is

754.48 --> 761.8000000000001
concerning musical qualities and the guy

756.67 --> 766.829
is just amazing and music wise you know

761.8 --> 769.8389999999999
he is a bit maybe a little too high P

766.829 --> 771.5089999999999
but no gives a [ __ ] you know the music

769.839 --> 781.589
is freaking amazing

771.509 --> 781.589
so yeah

783.63 --> 787.139
so I'm just enjoying that and that's

785.55 --> 790.2199999999999
also part of the reason why I don't

787.139 --> 793.8
really I'm not really in the mood for

790.22 --> 797.2090000000001
fighting you know I'm just having a good

793.8 --> 804.74
time you know I just turned 40

797.209 --> 806.0089999999999
pretty much right now this second yeah

804.74 --> 813.48
really

806.009 --> 817.23
but yeah I'm I don't feel this there's

813.48 --> 822.509
not a drama inside I'm surprisingly

817.23 --> 824.3100000000001
peaceful really I always thought like 40

822.509 --> 829.339
oh my god it's gonna be this gonna be

824.31 --> 832.7589999999999
that but now it's I feel like yeah

829.339 --> 832.759
that's okay

832.85 --> 838.36
you know could be a lot worse

835.28 --> 838.36
[Music]

853.47 --> 858.9300000000001
yeah somebody's wishing me happy

856.0 --> 863.25
birthday that's nice

858.93 --> 863.25
it's my friend in named Ava

872.04 --> 878.7099999999999
such a sweetheart

875.37 --> 880.75
it's funny because I know we talked

878.71 --> 885.5500000000001
about ethereal things too over the phone

880.75 --> 889.48
and I know she's kind of giving it like

885.55 --> 892.51
the astrology thing another dig she's

889.48 --> 895.03
done that before but now she's more

892.51 --> 900.58
stable as it was yes yes she's a mother

895.03 --> 902.02
and she knows her priorities but yes she

900.58 --> 904.98
does have some talent with it's

902.02 --> 907.63
fascinating it's interesting it is

904.98 --> 912.85
typical it is kind of like the feel of

907.63 --> 915.31
crippled seven except well not with as

912.85 --> 917.14
much background study to add on top of

915.31 --> 921.79
that in these good stories of course but

917.14 --> 923.47
very much yeah the astrology feel as

921.79 --> 926.3199999999999
she's getting into that and it's

923.47 --> 930.07
interesting it's never really been my

926.32 --> 933.25
thing but yeah there's some females that

930.07 --> 937.33
they're just good at that anyway that I

933.25 --> 943.17
know I I happen to bump into them over

937.33 --> 943.1700000000001
my lifetime anyway

948.86 --> 955.46
right yeah so I'm turning 40 and oh by

953.78 --> 957.3199999999999
the way thank you Adam I almost forgot

955.46 --> 960.74
to shout you out Thank You Adam for the

957.32 --> 962.87
10 pound super chat donation take a trip

960.74 --> 965.21
for a birthday coffee on me this

962.87 --> 965.9
afternoon happy birthday have a great

965.21 --> 969.64
day fella

965.9 --> 969.64
Thank You Man yeah I will

976.94 --> 985.25
yeah well I'm gonna get a few beers but

981.23 --> 988.49
I usually do but now I'm basically gonna

985.25 --> 990.77
make them happy beers I'm just gonna

988.49 --> 992.78
I've pretty much set my mind that this

990.77 --> 996.55
day is gonna be a happy day for me and

992.78 --> 996.55
nothing will be able to ruin it

996.97 --> 1000.63
that's very serious

1002.62 --> 1007.87
[Music]

1003.88 --> 1016.8389999999999
because yeah it's like I need that for a

1007.87 --> 1019.829
moment it's before they'd strip her out

1016.839 --> 1019.8290000000001
this on that's hilarious

1032.69 --> 1036.43
why would you say that mark color

1044.46 --> 1051.0900000000001
well look there is some [ __ ] going down

1048.42 --> 1053.66
now there is some tension if my life is

1051.09 --> 1053.6599999999999
not perfect

1053.73 --> 1061.58
from a personal angle but I don't know

1058.32 --> 1064.04
if I look at myself say ten years ago I

1061.58 --> 1067.47
was a lot Wilder

1064.04 --> 1070.71
but I also literally didn't know where I

1067.47 --> 1073.83
was going like I did I couldn't figure

1070.71 --> 1077.01
out what didn't really do so everything

1073.83 --> 1079.98
that I would do and I would do it pretty

1077.01 --> 1083.04
intensely but it would not look out

1079.98 --> 1085.35
further than like two months and I would

1083.04 --> 1089.58
just not look further than two months

1085.35 --> 1091.4699999999998
about anything didn't set to anything so

1089.58 --> 1093.4499999999998
I would just work on [ __ ] anyway if it

1091.47 --> 1096.9
would work then it would keep on going

1093.45 --> 1100.44
it was very systematic but without a

1096.9 --> 1102.9
real plan and that is how I function and

1100.44 --> 1108.2
I spend a lot of any Ndebele skill so it

1102.9 --> 1110.8500000000001
wasn't entire waste but I was without a

1108.2 --> 1112.65
without a plan really for the long term

1110.85 --> 1115.59
not really I couldn't hold on to

1112.65 --> 1116.42
anything concerning I couldn't anchor

1115.59 --> 1123.5
myself

1116.42 --> 1126.44
it's afraid and now yeah ten years later

1123.5 --> 1131.58
things are very different I lost a lot

1126.44 --> 1134.1000000000001
but I also gained a lot it's like feel

1131.58 --> 1137.25
like I've been a tree in a period where

1134.1 --> 1141.6599999999999
I did get a lot of growth because there

1137.25 --> 1143.64
was a lot of fruitful stuff in the

1141.66 --> 1146.0700000000002
ground maybe like a lot of animals came

1143.64 --> 1149.91
pooping and everything in good rain

1146.07 --> 1152.22
period and yeah I got to grew a lot grow

1149.91 --> 1157.2
a lot but then there's now there's a

1152.22 --> 1161.43
drought but still yeah I managed to

1157.2 --> 1165.42
build a lot and now I'm still stronger

1161.43 --> 1168.69
even though the situation that surrounds

1165.42 --> 1172.77
me is not as great but it's going better

1168.69 --> 1175.17
it's clearly getting better so that's

1172.77 --> 1177.78
just how I see it and that yeah that is

1175.17 --> 1186.8000000000002
better even though I lost a lot I

1177.78 --> 1186.8
a lot right what

1189.22 --> 1194.47
so yeah might be under a little tension

1191.8 --> 1196.72
like I'm not like you falling or

1194.47 --> 1197.6200000000001
something you know that's that's not

1196.72 --> 1200.05
really happy

1197.62 --> 1208.1399999999999
that's just euphoric that's just getting

1200.05 --> 1208.1399999999999
a kick out of something but what

1217.07 --> 1225.71
yeah markali well that's right it is but

1223.55 --> 1232.33
that's why I'm not going there for a

1225.71 --> 1237.92
while I don't know what I'm gonna do

1232.33 --> 1239.96
other things maybe I'm gonna do some

1237.92 --> 1244.7
studying in certain things like there

1239.96 --> 1246.98
are some couple of books that that I'd

1244.7 --> 1249.56
should dig into or maybe I'll get

1246.98 --> 1253.76
distracted by something else and then do

1249.56 --> 1258.3799999999999
that I don't know I don't know exactly

1253.76 --> 1262.43
yet but for today I'm just gonna take it

1258.38 --> 1265.0300000000002
easy and we'll see where things go after

1262.43 --> 1265.03
today

1271.41 --> 1275.559
[Music]

1280.22 --> 1286.1390000000001
Wow Thank You Amanda young for the $5

1283.499 --> 1289.3790000000001
super Jetta nation happy blessed

1286.139 --> 1291.779
birthday or when my favorite every year

1289.379 --> 1293.73
your ace thank you I really appreciate

1291.779 --> 1303.32
that that's really sweet

1293.73 --> 1303.32
a deck

1324.34 --> 1330.1689999999999
James Mason but my daughter put in

1327.889 --> 1332.62
astrology app on my phone that's so

1330.169 --> 1332.6200000000001
difficult

1344.18 --> 1347.74
and Orthodox

1357.419 --> 1361.039
that yeah

1368.63 --> 1380.0400000000002
and it seems like a bit of a weird

1371.19 --> 1384.23
things to say there I don't know for a

1380.04 --> 1384.23
guy to say that about another guy

1384.8 --> 1387.8
whatever

1391.1 --> 1394.1
yeah

1403.0 --> 1409.73
I'm on Kira okay well you getting a bit

1406.13 --> 1422.2700000000002
gay now so but that's fine thank you for

1409.73 --> 1422.8600000000001
the compliment mid-twenties Wow thank

1422.27 --> 1425.809
you

1422.86 --> 1430.58
well people usually done size me up like

1425.809 --> 1432.98
that anymore like deep in my 30s pretty

1430.58 --> 1436.6699999999998
much up until especially because of the

1432.98 --> 1440.54
energy I had even with my ex pretty much

1436.67 --> 1446.77
up until 32 I was so strong that people

1440.54 --> 1449.54
thought that I was like yet 20 to 21

1446.77 --> 1451.73
that was on us that was a real good for

1449.54 --> 1453.71
my ego but these days they size me up

1451.73 --> 1460.76
like in their 20s or something they

1453.71 --> 1462.8
don't know 25 hey that's fine with me on

1460.76 --> 1465.23
the other hand I could also see that as

1462.8 --> 1467.6599999999999
a detriment because people at that age

1465.23 --> 1472.79
category especially here tend to be kind

1467.66 --> 1480.4
of childish more than they used to be on

1472.79 --> 1487.54
that at that age but I don't mind

1480.4 --> 1496.68
I have a lot of depth to share to

1487.54 --> 1496.68
compensate yeah god I hope not

1499.83 --> 1506.6499999999999
Thank You Giulio Pavan for the $10 each

1503.92 --> 1510.16
a donation happy birthday Arwen and you

1506.65 --> 1514.9
missed Cleary super chat up to five oh I

1510.16 --> 1518.8600000000001
did huh I no longer support fvd happy

1514.9 --> 1524.17
birthday all right okay well guys I'm

1518.86 --> 1528.87
not telling you to like not like don't

1524.17 --> 1533.1100000000001
please don't go and boycotts fede okay

1528.87 --> 1542.25
this is it is a it is kind of a personal

1533.11 --> 1544.99
issue and you know I I just don't want

1542.25 --> 1548.11
infighting I just I just don't want it

1544.99 --> 1550.96
even if everybody pushes it I don't want

1548.11 --> 1553.36
to be part of that so hey if things now

1550.96 --> 1555.13
cool down or whatever over there you

1553.36 --> 1560.59
know maybe Nathan was just kind of sick

1555.13 --> 1563.0200000000002
of me for I get that it can happen now

1560.59 --> 1565.24
I'm kind of being making excuses for him

1563.02 --> 1568.59
it's just that yeah I'm pissed off

1565.24 --> 1572.29
I'm very disappointed but I'm just gonna

1568.59 --> 1574.87
step away for a while and see what

1572.29 --> 1580.87
happens and then I don't know what

1574.87 --> 1584.8899999999999
happens maybe yeah maybe I won't be back

1580.87 --> 1590.02
I don't know we'll see what happens but

1584.89 --> 1592.96
I need to just take a breather and you

1590.02 --> 1596.41
know may I probably be still like

1592.96 --> 1598.1200000000001
watching in the chat or whatever it's if

1596.41 --> 1601.39
I can handle all the troll [ __ ] because

1598.12 --> 1603.28
it's just very nutty even when I'm not

1601.39 --> 1607.22
around just constantly see my name there

1603.28 --> 1611.26
in chat it's just nuts but

1607.22 --> 1614.54
yeah I'm not gonna sit in that panel and

1611.26 --> 1617.45
kind of be forced to listen to things

1614.54 --> 1620.87
and not be able to add something to it

1617.45 --> 1625.96
or try to raise the bar intellectual

1620.87 --> 1625.9599999999998
wise at moments so that's yeah

1634.33 --> 1641.4099999999999
all right well the whole issue yesterday

1637.87 --> 1643.03
you know I'm not gonna be able to

1641.41 --> 1645.7
address it there while just might as

1643.03 --> 1648.75
well do it here it was really basic

1645.7 --> 1654.52
because what was happening is that I

1648.75 --> 1659.68
said who was it wasn't an Orthodox was

1654.52 --> 1664.9
it you'd that asked Nathan what is the

1659.68 --> 1668.02
horizon on the Flat Earth and yeah

1664.9 --> 1671.8000000000002
Nathan definitely recognized that as a

1668.02 --> 1674.92
potential straw man to try an anchor

1671.8 --> 1678.46
flat-earthers on a model you know that's

1674.92 --> 1682.21
that sound logic Nathan gets this like

1678.46 --> 1683.92
nobody else but it is kind of basic so

1682.21 --> 1687.69
he just kept on hammering on that for

1683.92 --> 1692.8600000000001
like a lot of time and like yeah it like

1687.69 --> 1695.1100000000001
in a way it is totally correct but the

1692.86 --> 1697.1499999999999
problem is because the guy just kept on

1695.11 --> 1699.61
trying to ask the same question and not

1697.15 --> 1700.0900000000001
getting an answer even though Nathan is

1699.61 --> 1704.62
correct

1700.09 --> 1708.22
it just feels like there is no coffee

1704.62 --> 1710.6799999999998
yeah there's there is no debate going

1708.22 --> 1713.65
because of it that's what it feels like

1710.68 --> 1715.75
we that's it's an unfortunate side

1713.65 --> 1718.8400000000001
effect but it is the consequence of that

1715.75 --> 1722.62
style so what I wanted to do is kind of

1718.84 --> 1726.37
save it by basically saying I respond to

1722.62 --> 1729.78
that okay yeah what is the horizon on

1726.37 --> 1733.6899999999998
the Flat Earth well it's an arbitrary

1729.78 --> 1740.3799999999999
apparent position based on observer

1733.69 --> 1743.5
height versus how far site allows in

1740.38 --> 1747.64
relation to the air clarity so

1743.5 --> 1750.99
technically yeah the horizon it's always

1747.64 --> 1750.99
going to be straight ahead

1752.18 --> 1760.0700000000002
and it's as far as sight allows as the

1758.45 --> 1763.8400000000001
weather conditions allow

1760.07 --> 1767.81
and that means clarity lack of

1763.84 --> 1770.48
refraction more clarity less refraction

1767.81 --> 1772.1
less blurring because refraction because

1770.48 --> 1773.75
of the blurring of the air because of

1772.1 --> 1776.75
the air quality is what eventually

1773.75 --> 1780.47
causes the gray soup or whatever blue

1776.75 --> 1782.3
soup in the background to just conceal

1780.47 --> 1784.04
everything even if there is an object

1782.3 --> 1786.6499999999999
there that would stick out you just

1784.04 --> 1788.6
don't see it anymore because it's our

1786.65 --> 1792.41
gray soup it's all blurred completely

1788.6 --> 1795.11
away but if that effect wouldn't be

1792.41 --> 1797.8100000000002
there if the reticle the the atmosphere

1795.11 --> 1803.51
would be a vacuum which it isn't then

1797.81 --> 1807.8899999999999
yeah the horizon would be as far away as

1803.51 --> 1810.29
the the pixels of site allowed basically

1807.89 --> 1813.47
then yeah but it's always going to be

1810.29 --> 1821.3
straight ahead so that that would be my

1813.47 --> 1824.69
answer to that and that is what it is it

1821.3 --> 1826.31
is an arbitrary apparent position where

1824.69 --> 1828.53
the sky meets the ground it's always

1826.31 --> 1831.26
going to be straight ahead because the

1828.53 --> 1834.53
earth is flat that's where it is and if

1831.26 --> 1836.75
it is not exactly there then there is

1834.53 --> 1838.8799999999999
refraction go then there is bending :

1836.75 --> 1841.34
then there's distortion going on then

1838.88 --> 1844.43
there is blurring going on preventing to

1841.34 --> 1846.6399999999999
see further and that is just how it

1844.43 --> 1846.64
works

1847.11 --> 1853.5
[Music]

1856.51 --> 1863.5
that is what the horizon is on the Flat

1859.28 --> 1869.6299999999999
Earth it's purely optics and that's it

1863.5 --> 1873.83
and that includes the concealment effect

1869.63 --> 1877.43
due to deep dive fraction so there is

1873.83 --> 1880.1899999999998
refraction that basically sets the

1877.43 --> 1882.41
limiter as to how far can be seen in

1880.19 --> 1885.0800000000002
general and now we're talking about

1882.41 --> 1889.52
physical things on the earth because

1885.08 --> 1892.01
celestial lights objects celestial

1889.52 --> 1895.16
things celestial bodies don't apply to

1892.01 --> 1898.82
that because they are they don't seem to

1895.16 --> 1901.19
be physical they don't they they're not

1898.82 --> 1903.8899999999999
affected it effective in the same way

1901.19 --> 1911.39
you can apply it really it's a different

1903.89 --> 1913.13
scene but anything physical yeah it's

1911.39 --> 1915.88
going to be limited by the refraction

1913.13 --> 1919.19
due to air clarity lack of air clarity

1915.88 --> 1921.44
the worse it is the closer by it's going

1919.19 --> 1924.02
to be cut off but it still will be

1921.44 --> 1927.14
probably far away and then there is

1924.02 --> 1930.02
diffraction effects which is natural to

1927.14 --> 1932.3000000000002
optics has to do with the nature of the

1930.02 --> 1936.04
lens apparently it's still very tough to

1932.3 --> 1938.69
figure that out but it causes

1936.04 --> 1941.99
concealment effects when you look over

1938.69 --> 1943.76
surfaces it always happens and there's a

1941.99 --> 1946.73
direct correlation with the observer

1943.76 --> 1949.16
height and the distance as to where the

1946.73 --> 1954.47
cut off point where things start to get

1949.16 --> 1956.51
concealed where that starts it's a

1954.47 --> 1960.68
linear relation I've been ant hammering

1956.51 --> 1962.51
on the limb linear concealment rate used

1960.68 --> 1964.01
to call it obstruction rate but it's

1962.51 --> 1965.27
technically not really obstruction

1964.01 --> 1969.76
because nothing is physically

1965.27 --> 1973.87
obstructing something else simply

1969.76 --> 1973.87
disappearing apparently behind

1974.96 --> 1982.23
so the concealment rate is pretty much

1978.39 --> 1986.94
linear after that point after the

1982.23 --> 1989.9
optical slant point where the where the

1986.94 --> 1989.9
horizon starts

1996.18 --> 2005.02
hello that moot I'm from the Netherlands

1999.18 --> 2005.02
I mean the Netherlands right now

2006.46 --> 2009.93
[Music]

2020.28 --> 2024.7
what

2022.2 --> 2028.45
what kind of a

2024.7 --> 2030.97
really professor feel balanced there

2028.45 --> 2034.5900000000001
cannot be a horizon of the flat surface

2030.97 --> 2037.54
oh really I beg to differ

2034.59 --> 2043.32
that's actually provable even adding a

2037.54 --> 2047.26
small scale in a warehouse a supermarket

2043.32 --> 2052.96
if you have a small off-camera positions

2047.26 --> 2053.46
right even on the table so this is kind

2052.96 --> 2057.31
of silly

2053.46 --> 2059.83
silly thing to say and besides a horizon

2057.31 --> 2064.99
it's an apparent effect inherent to

2059.83 --> 2067.5099999999998
optics there's always a horizon there's

2064.99 --> 2071.8599999999997
no place where there is sight where

2067.51 --> 2074.6490000000003
there is not the earth as it were so

2071.86 --> 2076.929
there will always be a horizon and the

2074.649 --> 2079.659
only thing that can prevent a horizon

2076.929 --> 2081.31
effect from being seen is by things

2079.659 --> 2087.79
being obstructed like for example

2081.31 --> 2089.2599999999998
standing in a hole yeah as long as there

2087.79 --> 2092.32
is sight into the distance there's

2089.26 --> 2096.19
always the horizon there is no actual

2092.32 --> 2098.23
visual no no photograph or any kind

2096.19 --> 2101.88
where there is not an arising out there

2098.23 --> 2101.88
that's that's all science fiction

2110.83 --> 2116.869
[Music]

2113.4 --> 2119.4900000000002
that is if you aim the camera of

2116.869 --> 2123.809
horizontal yeah of course if you just

2119.49 --> 2127.43
point up that you might not get the

2123.809 --> 2127.4300000000003
horizon but you know what I mean

2136.41 --> 2141.21
yeah I'm also on the live I haven't done

2138.48 --> 2145.38
anything there yet but I do have an

2141.21 --> 2148.58
account also called Arwen and I do hang

2145.38 --> 2148.58
around on the arrival of

2154.42 --> 2162.82
i watch Owen Benjamin there it is great

2157.69 --> 2166.78
and I'll lift a veil although recently

2162.82 --> 2169.3300000000004
it's just talking a lot of seems to be

2166.78 --> 2171.9700000000003
very much into the coronavirus fear porn

2169.33 --> 2175.93
or something I think he's genuinely

2171.97 --> 2176.56
scared of it but yeah that's just

2175.93 --> 2179.14
annoying

2176.56 --> 2182.13
I don't like that a lot and you know

2179.14 --> 2186.06
although I'm kind of interested in

2182.13 --> 2186.06
figuring out the wizardry

2188.51 --> 2191.659
[Music]

2193.51 --> 2203.9
the horizon in that black swuan image

2196.73 --> 2210.26
just be a haze that no the horizon is

2203.9 --> 2213.11
not the haze the haze is what like is

2210.26 --> 2215.84
what gets in the way the blur up the

2213.11 --> 2220.6600000000003
soup that prevents any further side

2215.84 --> 2220.6600000000003
that's not specifically the horizon

2230.69 --> 2235.28
but yeah The Horizon is better

2233.21 --> 2236.2400000000002
effectively the cutoff point so in this

2235.28 --> 2240.1400000000003

2236.24 --> 2242.93
yeah the horizon because of the whole

2240.14 --> 2245.12
incredible setup pretty much I can't

2242.93 --> 2247.8799999999997
really explain how how it is even

2245.12 --> 2254.12
possible to see that far at such a low

2247.88 --> 2257.9300000000003
altitude without it has to do with the

2254.12 --> 2260.2999999999997
angle I think anyway yeah it is

2257.93 --> 2263.1499999999996
absolutely only possible if the earth is

2260.3 --> 2266.0
flat let's start out with that let's not

2263.15 --> 2269.54
make a mistake about that but the the

2266.0 --> 2274.46
apparent horizon in that photograph from

2269.54 --> 2280.88
yeah zoomed in it does seem to pretty

2274.46 --> 2284.78
much be the waterline right before the

2280.88 --> 2288.5
refraction disperses all side so it's

2284.78 --> 2290.8100000000004
like the last type of thing that can be

2288.5 --> 2294.38
made out so in this case well the

2290.81 --> 2297.89
apparent horizon effect here in that oil

2294.38 --> 2300.1400000000003
rig photograph seems to be row at the

2297.89 --> 2303.47
edge of site where everything blurs up

2300.14 --> 2307.96
pretty much and it's not exactly

2303.47 --> 2311.24
expected because yeah I I can't even

2307.96 --> 2315.68
properly explain it through the optical

2311.24 --> 2319.43
slant theory because of the low the low

2315.68 --> 2321.89
proximity to the plane being looked over

2319.43 --> 2325.0899999999997
I can't explain why that is technically

2321.89 --> 2325.0899999999997
even possible like that

2326.26 --> 2334.4500000000003
no it's not a hard Horizon did you did

2330.38 --> 2334.4500000000003
you listen to a word I said t-bone

2338.75 --> 2342.1
doesn't seem like it

2347.48 --> 2356.34
[Music]

2353.31 --> 2359.13
yeah it is a Black Swan t-bone it is a

2356.34 --> 2364.26
Black Swan because it doesn't account

2359.13 --> 2368.25
for any geometrical curve that the globe

2364.26 --> 2370.23
earth model requires to be there and hey

2368.25 --> 2373.02
weather now everybody including rumpus

2370.23 --> 2375.75
starts to outright deny that and even

2373.02 --> 2378.0
deny that they ever claimed that that is

2375.75 --> 2383.73
what they have been claiming for years

2378.0 --> 2390.0
on end a daily basis indirectly and

2383.73 --> 2394.65
directly sometimes and it's it is the

2390.0 --> 2397.53
natural consequence that there has to be

2394.65 --> 2399.87
a sphere edge and if you look that far

2397.53 --> 2403.19
it it will get in the way that is how

2399.87 --> 2403.19
curvature Theory works

2419.08 --> 2427.48
right so yeah that site is a technical

2423.43 --> 2430.21
impossibility it is to the globe model

2427.48 --> 2434.92
and therefore it is the Black Swan it is

2430.21 --> 2436.87
the the one example that undoes the

2434.92 --> 2439.6
consist that you had the possible

2436.87 --> 2441.5499999999997
consistency of the model it it undoes

2439.6 --> 2446.2599999999998
the presupposition that that could be

2441.55 --> 2448.6600000000003
possible it is the Black Swan and

2446.26 --> 2451.96
there's many of them just got to point

2448.66 --> 2454.14
out that they're black swans that's the

2451.96 --> 2454.14
point

2458.53 --> 2461.6290000000004
[Music]

2464.45 --> 2470.98
now that's just a dumb thing to say

2466.55 --> 2470.98
t-bone stop wasting my time

2472.71 --> 2476.099
[Music]

2478.84 --> 2481.84
yeah

2512.69 --> 2515.319
yep

2515.77 --> 2520.93
yeah that's right tiny mumble well in

2518.29 --> 2524.5
that other picture it's very clear that

2520.93 --> 2530.7
there's more refraction going on is that

2524.5 --> 2535.21
more refraction causes more distortion

2530.7 --> 2539.3199999999997
causes more deviations that's what it

2535.21 --> 2541.6
does more refraction and yeah more

2539.32 --> 2544.81
thickness of air and all that causes

2541.6 --> 2550.54
more of deviation more refraction index

2544.81 --> 2554.98
change basically that's the effect so if

2550.54 --> 2557.8
there is very little refraction if it is

2554.98 --> 2560.5
all very clear homogeneous atmosphere

2557.8 --> 2564.4300000000003
then there will be very little bending

2560.5 --> 2566.55
very little concealment effects less of

2564.43 --> 2566.5499999999997
it

2570.55 --> 2574.0600000000004
but that's the funny thing about the

2572.38 --> 2578.83
whole globe claim because they claim

2574.06 --> 2582.0099999999998
that when the site looks like a globe

2578.83 --> 2585.2799999999997
that is the standard condition that is

2582.01 --> 2588.07
the normal refraction condition that

2585.28 --> 2590.4100000000003
makes it supposedly as is in a straight

2588.07 --> 2594.9
line of sight but that doesn't make any

2590.41 --> 2599.71
sense because when it's really clear

2594.9 --> 2601.21
specifically clear then you can see very

2599.71 --> 2603.52
far well that doesn't make any sense

2601.21 --> 2605.98
because if it's really clear that means

2603.52 --> 2608.79
that the refraction effect goes down the

2605.98 --> 2611.67
refraction index goes down that makes

2608.79 --> 2614.68
it's actually so it's all the opposite

2611.67 --> 2616.78
what they claim the refraction index

2614.68 --> 2619.5699999999997
goes down that makes everything much

2616.78 --> 2622.5400000000004
more straight as is and if the

2619.57 --> 2625.84
refraction index goes up then there

2622.54 --> 2627.94
becomes more deviations so they the

2625.84 --> 2629.86
ballers claim that when there's more

2627.94 --> 2632.92
deviations when the earth looks more

2629.86 --> 2634.6600000000003
like the ball in the sight that is when

2632.92 --> 2637.35
it is straight as is but that's the

2634.66 --> 2641.3799999999997
contradiction in our refraction works

2637.35 --> 2648.25
because it is actually thicker air it is

2641.38 --> 2650.37
more Distortion so yeah yes they flip it

2648.25 --> 2650.37
around

2655.2 --> 2660.479
yeah yeah yeah keep on cackling

2664.38 --> 2669.8900000000003
no Preston Parker stop stop bugging me

2677.75 --> 2680.84
[Music]

2681.88 --> 2684.88
okay

2693.109 --> 2697.22
and I'm not necessary

2699.27 --> 2707.67
it's the horizon not a reification

2702.45 --> 2707.6699999999996
fallacy of what

2709.6 --> 2720.73
what is the argument I was to horizon

2713.83 --> 2727.06
being used as an argument or is this a

2720.73 --> 2729.82
what is it is this about the global

2727.06 --> 2731.0499999999997
claim of horizon is this about you what

2729.82 --> 2744.69
is this about you're not being very

2731.05 --> 2748.9900000000002
clear here right okay well yeah the

2744.69 --> 2754.05
geometrical horizon which is a necessity

2748.99 --> 2760.6299999999997
for the globe earth to be a sphere right

2754.05 --> 2763.3
if you claim that the horizon is an

2760.63 --> 2764.86
actual geometrical sphere edge which has

2763.3 --> 2766.84
been done even though all the ballers

2764.86 --> 2768.73
are now all flipping it around say I've

2766.84 --> 2770.32
never done oh never even though the

2768.73 --> 2773.32
hundreds of hours of recording where

2770.32 --> 2778.81
everybody was just gushing that [ __ ]

2773.32 --> 2782.44
non-stop that's right that claim is a

2778.81 --> 2784.9
reification fallacy so yeah you're now

2782.44 --> 2790.05
all retracting that acting like never

2784.9 --> 2793.57
happened like 90 84 all over again but

2790.05 --> 2799.0
that has that doesn't make what has been

2793.57 --> 2800.92
said and done because you all have been

2799.0 --> 2803.92
saying that for four years and that is

2800.92 --> 2806.11
what nathan is doing and you can all

2803.92 --> 2808.84
pretend towards yourself like also

2806.11 --> 2811.81
mismatched because now suddenly we have

2808.84 --> 2814.06
forgotten that we've done that has all

2811.81 --> 2815.35
been different all the time right well

2814.06 --> 2819.0299999999997
that's not really gonna happen it's just

2815.35 --> 2819.0299999999997
gonna make you look more insane

2821.59 --> 2828.01
still gonna do it of course but yeah the

2825.25 --> 2830.55
reification fallacy still stands and

2828.01 --> 2832.63
Nathan is technically so responding to

2830.55 --> 2836.4700000000003
everything that's happened in the last

2832.63 --> 2837.88
four years when he does that to get some

2836.47 --> 2839.29
things off his chest about it too

2837.88 --> 2843.51
because it's been listening to that

2839.29 --> 2846.729
nonsense forever I get it

2843.51 --> 2846.7290000000003
[Music]

2864.8 --> 2867.9790000000003
[Music]

2878.87 --> 2883.66
yes thanks back to that

2883.79 --> 2889.429
yeah but they're not gonna get to me

2886.38 --> 2889.429
[Music]

2894.21 --> 2903.059
[Music]

2907.04 --> 2912.5
now you can of course you can the

2910.46 --> 2917.27
horizon isn't apparent the fact that can

2912.5 --> 2920.69
still be pointed at but yeah it is an

2917.27 --> 2925.72
optical arbitrary position but every

2920.69 --> 2929.66
picture we've taken horizontally will

2925.72 --> 2934.16
have one so you can definitely point at

2929.66 --> 2937.3999999999996
it but if you're also going to point at

2934.16 --> 2941.5699999999997
it and then claim that it is it the a

2937.4 --> 2944.3
curve point it is a geometrical edge of

2941.57 --> 2950.81
his familiar looking at then it becomes

2944.3 --> 2954.02
a reification fallacy now you can just

2950.81 --> 2956.21
all stop doing that of course but yeah

2954.02 --> 2958.64
what's been said has been said what's

2956.21 --> 2960.82
been done has been done you cannot

2958.64 --> 2964.49
pretend like it didn't happen but it did

2960.82 --> 2969.8500000000004
you did that you believed that you

2964.49 --> 2969.85
argued for that most of you

2971.13 --> 2975.6800000000003
yep good mood it is

2981.38 --> 2984.489
[Music]

2995.71 --> 3004.4700000000003
no I haven't read it but yeah I have

3001.52 --> 3006.06
unleashed my thoughts onto it and all

3004.47 --> 3009.24
that I've talked a little about it I

3006.06 --> 3013.7
don't necessarily need the exoteric

3009.24 --> 3013.7
promises you know

3019.579 --> 3023.51
come on Hanako a lad

3025.059 --> 3030.5190000000002
but yeah I'm not really interested in

3027.4 --> 3033.759
any exoteric promises that it makes you

3030.519 --> 3037.6299999999997
know my relation with God is very

3033.759 --> 3040.65
personal and no book can tell me or

3037.63 --> 3040.65
promise me anything

3045.12 --> 3051.88
[Music]

3047.85 --> 3053.77
it can just show me certain things and

3051.88 --> 3056.34
then I can reflect on it whether it is

3053.77 --> 3056.34
true or not

3061.89 --> 3067.95
[Music]

3063.43 --> 3067.95
Hey a Karen B thanks

3083.94 --> 3086.539
yeah

3095.109 --> 3103.269
what yeah no way but it does beyond

3099.579 --> 3106.8390000000004
practical example things the oil rigs

3103.269 --> 3111.069
are not entirely visible there is still

3106.839 --> 3113.619
piece cut off from the bottom of it it's

3111.069 --> 3116.109
remarkably little but it's there

3113.619 --> 3118.859
it still parts having cut off it's

3116.109 --> 3118.859
always happens

3148.0 --> 3151.179
[Music]

3152.81 --> 3156.13
now well that's not a question stallion

3155.15 --> 3159.35
8012

3156.13 --> 3162.26
that's a description and then just an

3159.35 --> 3165.44
outright statement straw man that can't

3162.26 --> 3169.7000000000003
happen on every your understanding of f

3165.44 --> 3172.01
e is dumb because you clearly are not

3169.7 --> 3174.71
taking it serious you're taking like a

3172.01 --> 3177.05
paper box cutout model and then thinking

3174.71 --> 3181.46
that that represents our reality and

3177.05 --> 3184.9100000000003
that's a straw man it's nonsense if you

3181.46 --> 3188.0
listen to my description of what I think

3184.91 --> 3190.7599999999998
the globe of the heavens is then you

3188.0 --> 3192.77
understand that yeah it doesn't really

3190.76 --> 3195.23
matter whatever you're going to

3192.77 --> 3198.44
presuppose the lights are specifically

3195.23 --> 3200.48
oriented around observers so that your

3198.44 --> 3202.7000000000003
lights are all at the edge of vision as

3200.48 --> 3208.73
I described it early on and it's with

3202.7 --> 3212.5699999999997
everything all sight all things and yeah

3208.73 --> 3219.17
even shadows caused by the Sun our div

3212.57 --> 3222.67
are different for each individual right

3219.17 --> 3224.7200000000003
because somebody else can be standing

3222.67 --> 3228.32
kilometers and kilometers and kilometers

3224.72 --> 3230.0
away to say yeah if there is enough air

3228.32 --> 3231.23
clarity right and they would be standing

3230.0 --> 3233.48
on a mountain looking at the first

3231.23 --> 3235.61
person well the first person would be

3233.48 --> 3237.62
getting Sun and Sun hitting the clouds

3235.61 --> 3240.1
and all kinds of things and then the

3237.62 --> 3246.17
other person looks at that person

3240.1 --> 3249.5299999999997
through for a lookingglass know p900 or

3246.17 --> 3251.9900000000002
whatever and then to them the Sun is not

3249.53 --> 3254.92
going to be hitting the same spots and

3251.99 --> 3260.18
casting the same shadows from clouds

3254.92 --> 3262.69
because the Sun is at another angle so

3260.18 --> 3262.69
yeah

3268.87 --> 3272.3199999999997
son is not what you think it is it is

3271.12 --> 3275.1099999999997
not a ball of fire

3272.32 --> 3278.1000000000004
hanging somewhere whether it be very far

3275.11 --> 3278.1
away or close by

3284.85 --> 3287.9
[Music]

3325.45 --> 3330.89
while stallion look it's very simple

3328.48 --> 3336.68
things like the Sun the celestial

3330.89 --> 3340.1
objects also can be concealed by

3336.68 --> 3344.18
diffraction effects it will go under

3340.1 --> 3347.89
beneath the apparent horizon that effect

3344.18 --> 3350.24
happens it's weird

3347.89 --> 3352.1
so if you're going to be standing very

3350.24 --> 3357.68
close to the ground while the horizon

3352.1 --> 3361.2999999999997
will be closer towards you and only make

3357.68 --> 3365.4199999999996
sense that it is well you could say well

3361.3 --> 3369.619
higher up because of it there's just

3365.42 --> 3373.16
more space covered up beneath you in

3369.619 --> 3376.1600000000003
relation to above you so it makes sense

3373.16 --> 3377.8689999999997
that yeah the Sun would be seemingly

3376.16 --> 3379.49
going under and then you go up higher

3377.869 --> 3382.88
while the horizon will be a lot further

3379.49 --> 3388.0899999999997
away suddenly that Sun is still within

3382.88 --> 3388.09
sight it makes perfect sense to me

3395.23 --> 3400.3
it starts to make very little sense when

3397.57 --> 3404.23
you imagine that the horizon is the

3400.3 --> 3406.4500000000003
leading edge of the sphere earth which

3404.23 --> 3410.19
you're looking past towards the Sun that

3406.45 --> 3410.1899999999996
it becomes all very very weird

3437.82 --> 3445.1400000000003
right yeah the Aries disk argument can

3440.67 --> 3450.11
be given for that that yeah that

3445.14 --> 3450.1099999999997
fraction you know it is it is there

3462.73 --> 3465.45
hmm

3472.15 --> 3484.96
what but weed men technically what

3476.68 --> 3490.8399999999997
depends on what for example if you lie
