it'll be much appreciated and yeah

76.56 --> 84.08
very helpful to keep my show running

79.759 --> 84.08
so today weather is

85.36 --> 90.4
it's degraded one step further and it's

89.2 --> 93.52000000000001
kind of like

90.4 --> 94.159
really clouded raining almost constantly

93.52 --> 96.72
but

94.159 --> 98.07900000000001
nah not constantly half of the time i

96.72 --> 101.36
managed to

98.079 --> 102.88
get some groceries in between and spin

101.36 --> 107.2
like this

102.88 --> 109.52
all day and night yesterday too

107.2 --> 111.60000000000001
uh i got up really early this morning

109.52 --> 114.32
because i was supposed to be

111.6 --> 116.88
some kind of video appointment for my

114.32 --> 118.719
gti situation but then it turned out

116.88 --> 120.79899999999999
that i had to

118.719 --> 123.6
do a lot more to get in that so that was

120.799 --> 127.119
like a big bummer

123.6 --> 127.67999999999999
although my dad noticed that i at least

127.119 --> 130.64
tried

127.68 --> 130.64000000000001
but yeah man

131.28 --> 136.64000000000001
like that company is like building some

134.64 --> 138.48
i don't know to me see me seems like

136.64 --> 141.51999999999998
convoluted hoops

138.48 --> 143.28
but still yeah it's no reason for me to

141.52 --> 146.87900000000002
step out especially be

143.28 --> 149.92
because literally today my license

146.879 --> 151.2
has been completely paid off a hundred

149.92 --> 154.72
percent

151.2 --> 157.11999999999998
as it were so i'm full in

154.72 --> 157.76
and it's only gains from here on pretty

157.12 --> 159.84
much

157.76 --> 161.84
even though in the form of crypto and

159.84 --> 165.84
still a lot of hassle

161.84 --> 168.48
but yeah good saturday as expected

165.84 --> 170.08
exactly in the middle of summer or

168.48 --> 170.39999999999998
originally i thought it was even gonna

170.08 --> 172.4
be

170.4 --> 174.64000000000001
only august but turned out to be even

172.4 --> 178.64000000000001
quicker right uh yeah also

174.64 --> 180.95899999999997
you might pick up some noise because uh

178.64 --> 181.76
my root there's a new roommate the old

180.959 --> 185.44
one

181.76 --> 186.879
moved out so yeah they're

185.44 --> 188.64
well they're not drilling in the walls

186.879 --> 190.959
at least they said but they are

188.64 --> 193.76
yeah making noise so if you're hearing

190.959 --> 197.44
something it's them

193.76 --> 198.48
right yeah so far seems like a nice

197.44 --> 200.64
roommate

198.48 --> 202.64
i told her i had a youtube show and all

200.64 --> 205.2
that talking about science

202.64 --> 205.67999999999998
specifically left out the word flat

205.2 --> 208.79899999999998
earth

205.68 --> 210.48000000000002
i'm gonna test that later

208.799 --> 212.0
but yeah if you start out with flat

210.48 --> 214.64
earth then pretty much

212.0 --> 215.599
if they're not if they can't handle that

214.64 --> 219.44
then everything

215.599 --> 221.28
else everything i say after

219.44 --> 223.04
that might sound intellectually they

221.28 --> 225.599
won't

223.04 --> 226.64
pick up on that so i know that from

225.599 --> 229.44
experience

226.64 --> 231.67999999999998
you know always end with flatter don't

229.44 --> 234.879
start out with it

231.68 --> 239.84
that's my tactic anyway so

234.879 --> 242.64
right i got tamara coffee with me

239.84 --> 245.12
and green tea of course let's see who's

242.64 --> 245.11999999999998
in chat

246.239 --> 249.68
it's not a lot of people here yet

252.4 --> 256.959
but maybe it was a late friday for a lot

255.76 --> 260.479
of people

256.959 --> 262.639
i'm sure it was it was kind of late for

260.479 --> 264.88
me as well like i

262.639 --> 266.72
i got up at nine o'clock but i went to

264.88 --> 270.24
bed at two

266.72 --> 272.56
so yeah because i just i don't know what

270.24 --> 272.56
it was

272.72 --> 277.04
i wanted to do stuff watch stuff and i

275.919 --> 279.03999999999996
guess i was a bit

277.04 --> 280.96000000000004
nervous for this morning that that too

279.04 --> 285.04
is a thing like if i have to get real

280.96 --> 288.71999999999997
up really early and i'm nervous about it

285.04 --> 290.639
then i can't sleep but usually it does

288.72 --> 296.08000000000004
work out

290.639 --> 298.0
afterward so

296.08 --> 300.24
but yeah a bit of a raspy throat because

298.0 --> 302.16
of the weather and not alone like

300.24 --> 304.479
a lot of people seem to be having that

302.16 --> 308.08000000000004
it's the direct response from the

304.479 --> 312.88
weather change yeah missouri bear i i

308.08 --> 312.88
i made a note of that missouri bear

312.96 --> 320.79999999999995
yep yeah bad timing buddy

317.68 --> 322.8
i've been trying to

320.8 --> 324.16
i don't know i guess drill you a little

322.8 --> 325.91900000000004
here in my chat

324.16 --> 328.32000000000005
i'm a lot more tolerant than that but

325.919 --> 330.71999999999997
yeah when big bears like that

328.32 --> 332.0
you can't do that [ __ ] you know you

330.72 --> 335.36
think you might

332.0 --> 337.919
it's all okay it's not and yeah

335.36 --> 340.96000000000004
you need to you need to sharpen your

337.919 --> 343.28
sense for that a little thing

340.96 --> 344.23999999999995
but yeah that happened anyway agm was

343.28 --> 348.55999999999995
first in chat

344.24 --> 351.52
amanda jung robin stanley

348.56 --> 352.0
gladshaw missouri bear alright good to

351.52 --> 355.19899999999996
see you all

352.0 --> 356.4
i'm sure more will get in even though

355.199 --> 358.72
for some reason the show

356.4 --> 360.15999999999997
started out with six down votes makes no

358.72 --> 361.91900000000004
sense

360.16 --> 364.0
that doesn't even happen that often or

361.919 --> 366.4
they were really pissed off

364.0 --> 368.72
at my show from yesterday that might be

366.4 --> 368.71999999999997
you know

369.12 --> 372.4
because there is this weird correlation

371.44 --> 375.36
that when i do

372.4 --> 375.75899999999996
very specific cosmogeny related things

375.36 --> 377.44
and i

375.759 --> 379.12
put in more effort i have more drawings

377.44 --> 381.039
and all that [ __ ]

379.12 --> 383.039
that seems like that really has a

381.039 --> 386.15999999999997
backlash response from baller

383.039 --> 389.36
trolls that just

386.16 --> 392.16
really don't like that i think they do

389.36 --> 394.639
it more in response to that

392.16 --> 396.72
than when i get all hyped up and angry

394.639 --> 398.319
at them for some reason or i basically

396.72 --> 399.199
tell them they're [ __ ] idiots and all

398.319 --> 401.6
that

399.199 --> 403.52000000000004
you know no if i actually show real

401.6 --> 404.319
elaborate cosmogeny things put it down

403.52 --> 408.08
well

404.319 --> 411.36
they tend to bother me more

408.08 --> 412.88
also another thing involved maybe that i

411.36 --> 418.0
have finally decided to

412.88 --> 421.12
completely turn off the comment section

418.0 --> 423.039
because yeah i used to get a couple of

421.12 --> 424.0
nice people commenting there but it's

423.039 --> 427.199
like

424.0 --> 430.08
just being overrun by trolls and they

427.199 --> 432.88
constantly troll my old videos too so

430.08 --> 434.71999999999997
like the [ __ ] just keeps on piling up in

432.88 --> 436.96
places where i never even look

434.72 --> 438.96000000000004
and the notifications don't seem to work

436.96 --> 440.88
on that anymore even they

438.96 --> 443.44
you know well if it would then my

440.88 --> 446.479
notifications would just be

443.44 --> 449.52
comments only

446.479 --> 452.639
anyway a guns have never owned

449.52 --> 454.639
and cava so yeah missouri bear got

452.639 --> 457.68
banned because

454.639 --> 462.639
yeah just owen was in

457.68 --> 462.639
a bad mood because he felt he had

462.96 --> 466.63899999999995
dealt with something in in a bad way

464.879 --> 468.8
like he was basically

466.639 --> 470.40000000000003
personally embarrassed like i know that

468.8 --> 472.319
situation

470.4 --> 474.15999999999997
he had the baritaria idea and then

472.319 --> 476.08000000000004
people started spamming to him

474.16 --> 477.59900000000005
like yeah we'll put down his money and

476.08 --> 480.31899999999996
then they didn't

477.599 --> 482.24
but he he didn't realize that when it

480.319 --> 484.8
happened

482.24 --> 486.479
so it's like when you have a great plan

484.8 --> 488.08
and suddenly everybody rushes towards

486.479 --> 490.08
you and he didn't get a lot of donations

488.08 --> 494.479
by the way but just not as much as

490.08 --> 496.71999999999997
it seemed at the start

494.479 --> 497.52
and yeah that kind of weird in a way

496.72 --> 499.52000000000004
when i

497.52 --> 501.35999999999996
the air filter thing remember when i

499.52 --> 502.15999999999997
first handed it it suddenly got piles of

501.36 --> 505.68
money and it

502.16 --> 508.56
like was overrun by it a bit

505.68 --> 510.319
so it's not exactly the same setup but

508.56 --> 511.68
yeah i got a lot of [ __ ] for that

510.319 --> 513.599
afterward too

511.68 --> 515.12
and yeah by the way not even necessarily

513.599 --> 519.279
from

515.12 --> 521.36
uh was it samhain

519.279 --> 524.64
that that gave me that back then or was

521.36 --> 524.64
it you dank i'm not sure

525.36 --> 530.399
anyway i've i haven't seen simone for a

528.0 --> 535.68
while since the whole

530.399 --> 539.2
ranty incident but whatever

535.68 --> 540.7199999999999
right but yeah he was just embarrassed

539.2 --> 543.9200000000001
and when big bear is embarrassed

540.72 --> 543.9200000000001
he lashes out

545.36 --> 549.6
you know but i thought that he took care

548.88 --> 552.0
of

549.6 --> 554.24
the situation when he really at least

552.0 --> 556.56
understood he

554.24 --> 557.6
he basically put it out exactly what he

556.56 --> 560.399
thought of it

557.6 --> 561.6
what the mistake was all that and what

560.399 --> 564.64
he's gonna do with it and

561.6 --> 566.399
i still think it's an awesome idea i

564.64 --> 568.64
also typed in there like yeah

566.399 --> 570.48
just don't worry about it save it for

568.64 --> 572.56
the bear fund

570.48 --> 577.839
and it's just a slow growth thing you

572.56 --> 577.8389999999999
know these big things usually are

579.44 --> 583.44
and yeah just curious to see where that

581.68 --> 587.04
goes oh check paypal

583.44 --> 589.9200000000001
oh and by the way oh that's nice

587.04 --> 591.76
yeah before that even uh yesterday i got

589.92 --> 596.7199999999999
a paypal from dank

591.76 --> 598.08
for 40 euros so thank you dank for that

596.72 --> 600.08
i don't know if you did that during the

598.08 --> 600.72
show or right after but thank you so

600.08 --> 603.44
much for

600.72 --> 606.0790000000001
for your support and now i'm going to

603.44 --> 606.0790000000001
check again

614.56 --> 624.88
oh man

619.04 --> 624.88
thank you man 50 euros

632.399 --> 634.72
man

635.839 --> 639.36
yeah this is this is great

639.92 --> 647.12
this is what it's called to know

644.079 --> 650.079
that you can stay afloat

647.12 --> 650.72
with such great support and i'm going to

650.079 --> 653.279
try to

650.72 --> 653.279
basically

654.72 --> 660.399
yeah keep keep the the better quality

658.24 --> 662.5600000000001
output as well

660.399 --> 663.519
so i'm really sticking to the notes and

662.56 --> 665.5189999999999
it's

663.519 --> 667.92
because before it's like yeah this

665.519 --> 672.5600000000001
doesn't work because i don't like it

667.92 --> 675.92
now i'm realizing yeah

672.56 --> 679.92
maybe that not liking it is kind of

675.92 --> 684.079
run its course and i should just do it

679.92 --> 686.88
because there's like need for for a

684.079 --> 688.0
an action-based expansion in my routines

686.88 --> 690.24
to support

688.0 --> 692.0
what i'm doing here like i should really

690.24 --> 693.92
do it now i felt it

692.0 --> 697.2
so i'm doing it i am making notes it's

693.92 --> 697.1999999999999
just i don't know

698.079 --> 704.0
ah it's not even that elaborate

701.44 --> 705.519
but yeah home benjamin yesterday oh yeah

704.0 --> 709.76
by the way he also

705.519 --> 713.12
really hit hard on lift the fill

709.76 --> 714.16
holy [ __ ] man nathan stalton i follow

713.12 --> 717.2
that guy too

714.16 --> 719.1999999999999
and yeah he basically just said

717.2 --> 720.48
liftville is gay and then started to

719.2 --> 723.1600000000001
make metaphors with

720.48 --> 724.9590000000001
why and point out his behavior and

723.16 --> 727.04
[Music]

724.959 --> 728.3199999999999
i have to say i kind of agree he of

727.04 --> 733.36
course put it out full

728.32 --> 737.0400000000001
force back bear style but yeah nathan

733.36 --> 739.76
nathan staltman specifically

737.04 --> 740.48
yeah you know what i mean if you've

739.76 --> 742.399
watched him

740.48 --> 744.0790000000001
i still think he's kind of amusing but

742.399 --> 748.079
he's uh he's just

744.079 --> 751.279
really kind of playing politics

748.079 --> 753.3599999999999
with the narratives now and

751.279 --> 755.279
staying on the corona band where like

753.36 --> 757.44
staying in between saying like

755.279 --> 759.519
yeah there's against it but for it i i'm

757.44 --> 761.36
gonna stay neutral

759.519 --> 764.0
even though it's blatantly obvious it's

761.36 --> 764.0
all false

765.36 --> 768.16
so yeah he took

769.279 --> 773.519
he took him apparently also because

772.639 --> 776.639
nathan had

773.519 --> 777.76
prodded him somehow i i don't remember

776.639 --> 780.8
exactly why but

777.76 --> 784.8389999999999
i think an email or something right

780.8 --> 786.639
uh oh yeah i've also been watching some

784.839 --> 790.8800000000001
netflix

786.639 --> 792.9590000000001
movies some movies with the rock

790.88 --> 794.16
that guy there's a lot of movies he

792.959 --> 796.6389999999999
plays in that i like

794.16 --> 796.639
these days

798.399 --> 804.88
but yeah i watched san andrea andreas

801.44 --> 806.639
never seen that before big cgi disaster

804.88 --> 809.8389999999999
movie but i thought it was actually

806.639 --> 812.399
kind of good and there was so much

809.839 --> 814.32
play with the environment for from up

812.399 --> 816.0
close perspectives like i thought that

814.32 --> 818.9590000000001
eventually like

816.0 --> 820.88
the boat scenes in the flooded trashed

818.959 --> 823.8389999999999
city were just

820.88 --> 826.56
they were very convincing like the whole

823.839 --> 828.8800000000001
thing watching it

826.56 --> 829.8389999999999
you know sometimes uh the disaster

828.88 --> 833.36
movies get all

829.839 --> 835.839
cgi spectacle just to make you have this

833.36 --> 837.1990000000001
oversight over how giant of disastrous

835.839 --> 840.1600000000001
and all that right

837.199 --> 840.959
but that actually same see in retrospect

840.16 --> 844.399
gives it a

840.959 --> 845.8389999999999
less real feel well this thing it kind

844.399 --> 847.519
of

845.839 --> 850.399
it did that couple of times but it

847.519 --> 853.92
mostly stuck to really

850.399 --> 856.079
up close experiences and i thought

853.92 --> 857.519
yeah it was much more visceral that way

856.079 --> 860.56
so yeah another movie

857.519 --> 862.5600000000001
hollywood movie san andreas

860.56 --> 864.16
and then i proceeded on to i'm not even

862.56 --> 866.4799999999999
finished that movie yet but central

864.16 --> 868.8
intelligence which also has it

866.48 --> 870.0
that is a weird movie i haven't made up

868.8 --> 873.8389999999999
my mind about it yet

870.0 --> 873.839
but it's all about the cia and

875.279 --> 882.079
yeah it's a weird one and like

878.8 --> 886.0
a giant lineup for that movie like the

882.079 --> 888.959
intro for it there's like five or six

886.0 --> 889.44
big movie corporations involved in that

888.959 --> 892.8
so

889.44 --> 895.1990000000001
yeah that the central intelligence movie

892.8 --> 896.8389999999999
is like a big project and i'm i've

895.199 --> 900.4799999999999
already detected

896.839 --> 902.0
interesting information placement

900.48 --> 905.6800000000001
basically in there

902.0 --> 907.92
but just snippets i i only halfway so i

905.68 --> 909.5999999999999
don't even know yet

907.92 --> 912.7199999999999
right that's what i've been doing

909.6 --> 914.72
yesterday and then

912.72 --> 916.48
it was time for bed i think i also hung

914.72 --> 919.76
around in uh

916.48 --> 919.76
at emma uk's again

921.44 --> 927.839
i don't think too long anyway so yeah

924.079 --> 927.8389999999999
let's see what you guys

938.839 --> 942.8800000000001
doing yeah natural law can never be in

941.44 --> 944.8000000000001
violation

942.88 --> 947.04
but yeah missouri bear the problem is

944.8 --> 949.3599999999999
that ballers basically discard that

947.04 --> 950.959
notion and says no natural law only

949.36 --> 954.16
works

950.959 --> 955.92
here and it's different there

954.16 --> 957.68
or the other way around they do this

955.92 --> 958.399
kind of thing they they think that's

957.68 --> 959.92
okay

958.399 --> 961.6
they don't understand that natural law

959.92 --> 964.88
is absolutely universal

961.6 --> 966.32
because if it weren't if it is spatially

964.88 --> 968.88
dependent

966.32 --> 969.519
then it's not natural law anymore and

968.88 --> 972.16
hey

969.519 --> 974.079
somebody could prove that that would be

972.16 --> 976.48
interesting

974.079 --> 979.5999999999999
you know but there is no reason to

976.48 --> 982.8000000000001
believe it is possible and that is

979.6 --> 985.44
why it is natural law until somebody

982.8 --> 988.88
disproves it well good luck with that

985.44 --> 988.8800000000001
the likelihood seems

988.959 --> 994.88
yeah bar a miraculous

992.24 --> 996.0
overlooking overlooked situation seems

994.88 --> 998.36
absolutely impossible

996.0 --> 999.68
and even if there was some natural

998.36 --> 1001.519
inconsistencies

999.68 --> 1004.0
that still would mean that the earth is

1001.519 --> 1007.04
a ball in outer space

1004.0 --> 1009.6
okay that only means that i don't know

1007.04 --> 1010.079
perhaps very very far up there there

1009.6 --> 1012.88
would be

1010.079 --> 1014.959
for example no more relative density

1012.88 --> 1017.519
workings

1014.959 --> 1017.5189999999999
who knows

1019.5 --> 1022.6
[Music]

1022.839 --> 1028.0
or

1024.959 --> 1030.24
or yeah i don't know get let's get all

1028.0 --> 1032.72
silly maybe up there there is

1030.24 --> 1034.0
a vacuum for a surprisingly long

1032.72 --> 1036.16
distance

1034.0 --> 1038.16
and when you then size up the entire

1036.16 --> 1041.039
gradient it doesn't make logical sense

1038.16 --> 1041.439
that could be you know there could be

1041.039 --> 1044.559
just

1041.439 --> 1046.4
weird off things that would make you

1044.559 --> 1048.16
draw natural laws in doubt but you would

1046.4 --> 1052.0800000000002
have to have all the data

1048.16 --> 1055.1200000000001
all of it and then only you know

1052.08 --> 1058.559
and we don't oh hello mandy young

1055.12 --> 1063.039
yeah i'll check my paypal saturday

1058.559 --> 1063.039
starting out uh quite nice

1065.679 --> 1069.2
oh wow

1069.36 --> 1074.9599999999998
man thank you amanda young for the

1072.24 --> 1074.96
twenty dollars

1075.36 --> 1081.84
thank you so much wow

1082.72 --> 1088.32
you know that i've actually mentioned

1085.84 --> 1088.32
to uh

1089.28 --> 1092.96
to my roommate about my sponsors and

1091.76 --> 1096.0
basically tell them yeah

1092.96 --> 1097.44
they are my science fund

1096.0 --> 1100.32
so i don't have to rely on the

1097.44 --> 1102.16
government i kind of halfway jokingly

1100.32 --> 1103.6
told her

1102.16 --> 1105.76
and it does kind of feel like that

1103.6 --> 1106.6399999999999
because i do really feel like i'm a

1105.76 --> 1108.799
scientist

1106.64 --> 1110.48
i that's what i wanted to be always and

1108.799 --> 1114.08
then it turned out that the world's

1110.48 --> 1116.64
just not it's not real in in the world

1114.08 --> 1118.3999999999999
that is available so i just thought no

1116.64 --> 1120.8400000000001
i'll just do it myself i'll just be a

1118.4 --> 1124.16
freaking hobo scientist or whatever you

1120.84 --> 1126.24
know because i can't let it go

1124.16 --> 1127.2
the the hunger of inside like i can't

1126.24 --> 1131.36
let it

1127.2 --> 1133.8400000000001
i can't stop it i have to figure it out

1131.36 --> 1135.1999999999998
even if i don't have anything available

1133.84 --> 1137.9189999999999
just you in my mind

1135.2 --> 1138.799
and yeah you guys are kind of giving me

1137.919 --> 1141.919
a

1138.799 --> 1146.799
a science fund to to live and

1141.919 --> 1150.0
teach first and foremost and research

1146.799 --> 1153.76
and yeah great i love it i'm i'm

1150.0 --> 1156.72
a public funded grassroots

1153.76 --> 1158.4
scientist and i can say that because i'm

1156.72 --> 1161.919
not an engineer

1158.4 --> 1165.2800000000002
you know i have finished school i

1161.919 --> 1168.4
i do understand the scientific method

1165.28 --> 1170.32
i can hypothesize properly

1168.4 --> 1172.0800000000002
even though i'm not like the most

1170.32 --> 1174.32
prominent guy or whatever you know i'm

1172.08 --> 1176.8799999999999
not the most talented

1174.32 --> 1179.36
no i as a scientist i'm not so super

1176.88 --> 1182.7990000000002
technical as i am more

1179.36 --> 1185.84
a visualizer and dreamer

1182.799 --> 1187.84
and yeah a dreamer which is

1185.84 --> 1188.9599999999998
typically the type of character that

1187.84 --> 1192.32
comes up with

1188.96 --> 1195.8400000000001
brand new conceptions that's what my

1192.32 --> 1195.84
that's what i do as a scientist

1196.4 --> 1199.679
originally i even thought like you're a

1198.0 --> 1202.96
scientist no i'm

1199.679 --> 1202.96
i'm a i'm an artist

1205.2 --> 1210.88
but yeah the the line in between

1208.799 --> 1214.32
it can be kind of fake it all depends on

1210.88 --> 1214.3200000000002
what it is you are doing

1219.28 --> 1223.6
so yeah thank you so much for all the

1220.88 --> 1223.6000000000001
sponsor and

1224.0 --> 1235.84
it's a great relief

1239.679 --> 1243.679
really hannah koala everybody calls you

1242.32 --> 1247.28
anna

1243.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
that's weird or you mean the h

1247.28 --> 1249.84
at the back

1258.08 --> 1263.84
anyway uh

1272.72 --> 1280.159
who's this

1277.12 --> 1281.1999999999998
there is plenty oh we got a baller that

1280.159 --> 1282.7990000000002
thinks that we

1281.2 --> 1284.32
have to find the evidence for their

1282.799 --> 1287.28
claims

1284.32 --> 1288.48
oh that's brilliant brilliant crafty

1287.28 --> 1291.6
killer

1288.48 --> 1293.76
well i'm sorry to say but

1291.6 --> 1294.7199999999998
yeah what my channel is not a good place

1293.76 --> 1297.84
to

1294.72 --> 1300.0
find globe evidence

1297.84 --> 1302.6399999999999
i know you think that it's all out there

1300.0 --> 1304.48
you know that's what they all think

1302.64 --> 1307.1200000000001
that's the whole thing when a ballers

1304.48 --> 1311.28
actually put a task

1307.12 --> 1313.28
to bring forth the evidence to find it

1311.28 --> 1316.32
themselves and present it

1313.28 --> 1318.32
that's where things go get into trouble

1316.32 --> 1320.559
and you know this if you follow the flat

1318.32 --> 1324.08
earth debate so

1320.559 --> 1333.84
yeah we're not gonna do the work

1324.08 --> 1333.84
for you sorry

1344.84 --> 1350.0
hmm

1347.039 --> 1350.0
hey this gang

1356.4 --> 1361.8400000000001
prime video what's that

1374.96 --> 1377.2
hmm

1382.24 --> 1389.84
right i kind of rattled all through all

1384.32 --> 1389.84
that quite quickly

1405.919 --> 1411.039
yeah maybe today is you know i yesterday

1409.12 --> 1412.6399999999999
and the day before i kind of put out

1411.039 --> 1415.2
quite intense stuff and i

1412.64 --> 1418.96
drew the drawings and all that maybe

1415.2 --> 1418.96
today is just a break day

1419.52 --> 1422.72
not saying that i'm just gonna do bore

1421.84 --> 1425.12
the hell out of you

1422.72 --> 1427.76
all but i've had a couple of quite

1425.12 --> 1429.76
intense days and

1427.76 --> 1433.12
like uh yeah at this moment i'm just

1429.76 --> 1433.12
thinking like hmm yeah what

1434.559 --> 1438.799
like i put down the different

1436.32 --> 1441.9189999999999
conceptions

1438.799 --> 1442.72
i i showed them i'm especially proud of

1441.919 --> 1446.0800000000002
my

1442.72 --> 1446.08
my ring earth conception

1448.159 --> 1456.96
but just as a visual aid i think it is

1453.279 --> 1459.6
yeah it is good like

1456.96 --> 1462.72
i'm i'm kind of interested also to see

1459.6 --> 1462.7199999999998
what the mind

1462.799 --> 1469.12
what my mind does as i'm looking at it

1466.0 --> 1469.44
you know like first like i know what it

1469.12 --> 1471.279
is

1469.44 --> 1473.44
right i know what it's supposed to be i

1471.279 --> 1474.24
know what it is supposed to be then i'm

1473.44 --> 1477.279
looking it

1474.24 --> 1479.1200000000001
at it as if i'm a person that doesn't

1477.279 --> 1481.039
know what this is

1479.12 --> 1483.1999999999998
and just see like what would they think

1481.039 --> 1485.039
of it if for example there were

1483.2 --> 1487.1200000000001
landmasses and like would they recognize

1485.039 --> 1489.52
oh like is that a map

1487.12 --> 1492.3999999999999
is that creative with a map or something

1489.52 --> 1492.4
you know and then

1493.36 --> 1496.799
i try to imagine like what if they

1494.88 --> 1498.159
didn't know but they were really curious

1496.799 --> 1500.08
like they were insistent

1498.159 --> 1502.0
on trying to figure it out like almost

1500.08 --> 1504.32
like you're trying to figure out

1502.0 --> 1506.24
an ancient depiction of something you

1504.32 --> 1506.72
know they like they had to understand

1506.24 --> 1510.64
what this

1506.72 --> 1513.2
is and that's how we look at it

1510.64 --> 1515.3600000000001
and just see like does what impression

1513.2 --> 1518.159
does this make how can i compare that to

1515.36 --> 1520.4799999999998
impressions that i felt when i've looked

1518.159 --> 1523.279
at really ancient depictions

1520.48 --> 1524.24
because i talked about that i think that

1523.279 --> 1527.44
like

1524.24 --> 1531.039
cosmogeny depictions

1527.44 --> 1534.0
are are out there but they're

1531.039 --> 1537.2
never just a flat discard no there's

1534.0 --> 1540.32
just these weird staircases and

1537.2 --> 1541.6000000000001
levels and things and like turnarounds

1540.32 --> 1544.1589999999999
around

1541.6 --> 1545.36
orientations it's just all these things

1544.159 --> 1548.5590000000002
always have

1545.36 --> 1550.8799999999999
that type of element to it and i

1548.559 --> 1552.0
always when i was young just wanted to

1550.88 --> 1554.4
understand

1552.0 --> 1556.24
like what is that why is it like that is

1554.4 --> 1558.0
that like another dimension

1556.24 --> 1559.679
is that like a spiritual representation

1558.0 --> 1560.96
is that a representation of the feelings

1559.679 --> 1563.279
of this situation

1560.96 --> 1565.279
or is that is that the actual realm and

1563.279 --> 1566.799
the other one is like the over dimension

1565.279 --> 1571.2
and

1566.799 --> 1572.799
see and yeah i'm trying to compare the

1571.2 --> 1575.44
feelings i got from those

1572.799 --> 1576.6399999999999
impressions and then comparing it to

1575.44 --> 1579.52
these depictions

1576.64 --> 1580.64
and see if i taught if i recognize a

1579.52 --> 1583.44
feeling

1580.64 --> 1586.96
a compatibility in essence which is

1583.44 --> 1586.96
purely intuitive by the way

1588.24 --> 1599.84
and yeah that's what i'm doing

1603.52 --> 1613.84
oh god you love bad movies more colored

1617.039 --> 1620.8799999999999
i had a i have a weird knack for that

1619.2 --> 1622.96
too

1620.88 --> 1624.88
but i don't just like watching them all

1622.96 --> 1626.08
the time i like knowing about them and

1624.88 --> 1630.5590000000002
then just

1626.08 --> 1632.08
giggling or just being like what they

1630.559 --> 1633.9189999999999
actually did that

1632.08 --> 1635.36
that's what i think is really hilarious

1633.919 --> 1637.279
especially like with

1635.36 --> 1640.9599999999998
like the cheap ass there's some really

1637.279 --> 1644.24
freaky copycat cartoons out there

1640.96 --> 1648.08
and i've known a guy for over damn

1644.24 --> 1650.88
15 years who reviews those things

1648.08 --> 1655.84
and it's just the most hilarious moment

1650.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
of the week for me

1656.72 --> 1660.159
but i've never really collected them

1658.32 --> 1661.279
like i wouldn't even want to watch those

1660.159 --> 1664.88
movies because they're

1661.279 --> 1668.08
terrible and boring and stupid

1664.88 --> 1670.5590000000002
but also just with bizarre

1668.08 --> 1672.8799999999999
technical issues and and just really

1670.559 --> 1676.24
stupid choreography

1672.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
this is hilarious just to know it there

1676.24 --> 1683.84
i'm not gonna watch that [ __ ]

1699.84 --> 1706.48
right sometimes they do great work on b

1703.279 --> 1706.48
movies that is correct

1707.679 --> 1715.39
budget is not everything

1710.78 --> 1715.3899999999999
[Music]

1719.44 --> 1722.3200000000002
that's so weird

1722.799 --> 1727.12
like is that is that a germanic thing or

1725.76 --> 1730.32
something maybe

1727.12 --> 1734.4799999999998
i don't know what it is no probably not

1730.32 --> 1737.52
but yeah coincidentally like did

1734.48 --> 1740.72
the worst cartoon movies that i've

1737.52 --> 1741.9
ever seen out there are german-made by

1740.72 --> 1744.949
the way

1741.9 --> 1744.949
[Music]

1747.2 --> 1752.48
and then they even have their own unique

1750.08 --> 1756.399
little charm but they are absolutely

1752.48 --> 1756.3990000000001
ridiculously dumb and ugly

1761.919 --> 1766.3990000000001
if you want to know about it and you

1765.2 --> 1771.44
don't mind a little

1766.399 --> 1771.4399999999998
old-fashioned liberal maybe dark humor

1771.919 --> 1775.279
then i know that

1776.559 --> 1781.84
the guy that reviews it

1786.08 --> 1790.8799999999999
this is his own website it's been around

1789.679 --> 1793.039
for a while

1790.88 --> 1794.64
yeah this has absolutely nothing to do

1793.039 --> 1797.2
with flat earth

1794.64 --> 1797.2
by the way

1798.399 --> 1802.0
but yeah this is my source for reviews

1801.679 --> 1805.2
on

1802.0 --> 1808.0
absolutely ridiculous cartoons

1805.2 --> 1809.52
and it's hilarious like i go all bouncy

1808.0 --> 1812.64
with hilarity

1809.52 --> 1812.6399999999999
when i see another one

1813.84 --> 1816.24
anyway

1818.399 --> 1823.4399999999998
what movies do i like okay well what

1820.559 --> 1825.6
movies i really like

1823.44 --> 1828.159
well a lot of movies i'm just like a lot

1825.6 --> 1828.1589999999999
of movies

1830.64 --> 1839.919
cartoons well

1837.2 --> 1842.48
i don't know there are good animated

1839.919 --> 1845.76
movies too

1842.48 --> 1849.279
but yeah they the i don't know they're

1845.76 --> 1851.84
the animated movies i don't know

1849.279 --> 1855.039
i haven't seen too much of them i prefer

1851.84 --> 1855.039
live-acted movies

1857.6 --> 1860.8799999999999
but in general i don't know my what i

1859.76 --> 1863.519
like is

1860.88 --> 1866.24
white i jus the most important element

1863.519 --> 1868.24
is is that i just like good movies

1866.24 --> 1871.36
i don't like oh i like this genre i'll

1868.24 --> 1874.48
watch everything of this genre

1871.36 --> 1875.1999999999998
you know that's not me never been like

1874.48 --> 1877.44
that

1875.2 --> 1879.44
like for example on average i'm a big

1877.44 --> 1883.679
star trek fan

1879.44 --> 1886.88
but not all of it but most of it

1883.679 --> 1888.64
i've seen all the movies seen the old

1886.88 --> 1891.8400000000001
series the next generation

1888.64 --> 1893.519
voyager even discovery but for example

1891.84 --> 1896.799
deep space nine

1893.519 --> 1898.72
i've it's still on in netflix trying to

1896.799 --> 1900.48
like lure me in like stare in my face

1898.72 --> 1902.64
like oh you can still watch this

1900.48 --> 1903.84
i don't want to i i don't know i don't

1902.64 --> 1906.64
like it i never like

1903.84 --> 1908.32
yeah this is completely irrational but i

1906.64 --> 1910.3200000000002
just don't want to watch it

1908.32 --> 1913.4399999999998
and there's the other there was another

1910.32 --> 1913.4399999999998
star trek series

1913.76 --> 1916.24
what is it

1916.799 --> 1922.96
uh after voyager that it also skipped

1920.559 --> 1923.6789999999999
it the there were pretty good actors in

1922.96 --> 1928.0
there even

1923.679 --> 1928.64
but it just completely did not appeal to

1928.0 --> 1930.799
me

1928.64 --> 1932.72
the whole thing i don't know what that

1930.799 --> 1937.679
was

1932.72 --> 1939.44
but yeah ask i have star trek lore

1937.679 --> 1941.919
besides that but it doesn't mean that i

1939.44 --> 1946.159
watch everything about it

1941.919 --> 1950.0
not everything but i liked a lot of it

1946.159 --> 1952.48
right and uh so yeah science fiction

1950.0 --> 1955.039
i can overall appreciate it not

1952.48 --> 1955.039
everything

1959.6 --> 1964.6399999999999
fantasy yeah you know but yeah there's

1961.76 --> 1966.72
good fantasy there's bad fantasy

1964.64 --> 1968.0800000000002
and there's meh fantasy and then there's

1966.72 --> 1972.88
like what

1968.08 --> 1972.8799999999999
fantasy so

1974.72 --> 1982.3990000000001
i like historical themed

1978.08 --> 1985.4399999999998
series even drama i like them a lot

1982.399 --> 1988.7199999999998
like a lot i always love it

1985.44 --> 1992.0
really like even if there is some

1988.72 --> 1995.039
scientific or some fantasy element

1992.0 --> 1997.519
put into it if there is enough

1995.039 --> 1999.519
like real serious consideration for

1997.519 --> 2002.96
historical reality

1999.519 --> 2005.44
in how it's set up then i'm usually very

2002.96 --> 2010.64
impressed

2005.44 --> 2010.64
and yeah so history

2010.96 --> 2016.88
typical tolkien style fantasy can very

2014.399 --> 2018.9599999999998
much appreciate that

2016.88 --> 2020.96
d movies did you know that there are

2018.96 --> 2023.3600000000001
like official dungeons and dragons

2020.96 --> 2023.3600000000001
movies

2023.44 --> 2030.799
yeah the first one is [ __ ]

2027.679 --> 2033.1200000000001
the second one is freaking amazing

2030.799 --> 2034.48
nobody knows about that one nobody

2033.12 --> 2037.76
second one is great

2034.48 --> 2041.279
watch it it's a really good d movie like

2037.76 --> 2044.1589999999999
that's a really good representation

2041.279 --> 2045.039
very impressed by it uh there's even a

2044.159 --> 2047.3600000000001
third one and

2045.039 --> 2049.44
this was yeah i don't know i'd have to

2047.36 --> 2051.7599999999998
watch it again to make up my mind if

2049.44 --> 2053.76
i thought it was good or not it was a

2051.76 --> 2055.28
darker it was more like an evil setting

2053.76 --> 2058.7200000000003
idea

2055.28 --> 2063.52
uh but the second one was great

2058.72 --> 2063.52
right other than that movies

2067.04 --> 2075.52
i don't know firefly yeah

2071.679 --> 2078.7200000000003
good old firefly firefly set a

2075.52 --> 2082.079
really really good example for

2078.72 --> 2085.2799999999997
deep character reality

2082.079 --> 2088.079
in science fiction where the character

2085.28 --> 2089.44
would basically draw away attention from

2088.079 --> 2092.44
the science fiction

2089.44 --> 2094.56
like minimalist science fiction

2092.44 --> 2097.599
fantastic

2094.56 --> 2104.16
brilliant i loved it it was such a

2097.599 --> 2104.1600000000003
tragedy it got cancelled right

2104.24 --> 2108.3199999999997
it's like i wonder if to this day

2106.56 --> 2109.119
there's still like an idea of like yeah

2108.32 --> 2112.48
we need to like

2109.119 --> 2114.4
revenge it and just

2112.48 --> 2115.92
restart the freaking series with the

2114.4 --> 2116.56
same actors even though they're all like

2115.92 --> 2118.96
10 years

2116.56 --> 2120.4
older or 20 years older right now i

2118.96 --> 2123.44
don't know just does

2120.4 --> 2126.64
freaking continue it this is

2123.44 --> 2129.44
bastards just do it anyway

2126.64 --> 2130.4
hell yeah we want to see the crew the

2129.44 --> 2133.68
older crew

2130.4 --> 2135.92
like more veteran pirates almost

2133.68 --> 2137.68
like what they've been through and [ __ ]

2135.92 --> 2140.7200000000003
like the

2137.68 --> 2144.0789999999997
the the yeah the falling apart of the of

2140.72 --> 2146.56
the empire pretty much

2144.079 --> 2148.88
which happened which would probably

2146.56 --> 2153.44
happen at the end of the movie

2148.88 --> 2155.839
right so but there's so much

2153.44 --> 2157.28
power still left in there if they wanted

2155.839 --> 2161.52
it they could still

2157.28 --> 2161.52
now continue it you know

2161.839 --> 2165.2
if it gets crazy enough it could even be

2163.92 --> 2167.599
just a grassroot

2165.2 --> 2170.839
funded project you know i think they

2167.599 --> 2172.7200000000003
could probably drag in just

2170.839 --> 2175.44
millions

2172.72 --> 2178.16
not through the usual routes but just

2175.44 --> 2178.16
from the public

2179.359 --> 2183.52
but yeah this people had been wanting

2181.76 --> 2184.5600000000004
that for a long time and then the movie

2183.52 --> 2188.16
came

2184.56 --> 2190.0789999999997
kind of shushed it because yeah

2188.16 --> 2192.3999999999996
the movie is a big tragedy like they

2190.079 --> 2195.119
kill off figures and it's like yeah

2192.4 --> 2195.119
the [ __ ] man

2195.839 --> 2200.7999999999997
even though what was left is still a

2198.16 --> 2201.68
viable enough crew to continue the

2200.8 --> 2204.7200000000003
series

2201.68 --> 2208.24
it's almost like the movie was like a

2204.72 --> 2210.9599999999996
transformers the movie situation

2208.24 --> 2211.839
remember that one oh big movie for me

2210.96 --> 2213.839
big one

2211.839 --> 2215.52
remember optimus prime was like my

2213.839 --> 2219.04
personal

2215.52 --> 2219.599
example when i was very young right so

2219.04 --> 2221.839
yeah

2219.599 --> 2224.32
optimus prime died in that movie and a

2221.839 --> 2227.119
lot of transformers got killed off which

2224.32 --> 2228.079
never ever happened in the series so it

2227.119 --> 2231.359
was a huge

2228.079 --> 2234.079
shock like literally kids were

2231.359 --> 2234.48
crying in theater and parents they had

2234.079 --> 2236.32
like

2234.48 --> 2237.92
really angry letters to them to the

2236.32 --> 2240.96
maker of it because of that

2237.92 --> 2243.28
but they did that and

2240.96 --> 2245.52
after that yeah it still continued with

2243.28 --> 2248.6400000000003
the new line of transformers in

2245.52 --> 2250.16
the cybertron era as it were like the

2248.64 --> 2253.2
the future type

2250.16 --> 2256.0789999999997
setting which i still thought was great

2253.2 --> 2256.72
but yeah that is that is almost what

2256.079 --> 2258.8
they did

2256.72 --> 2260.16
with the fireflight it just said like

2258.8 --> 2261.28
okay we we

2260.16 --> 2264.3199999999997
we're moving on we're going to be

2261.28 --> 2266.8
dramatic and they just killed off

2264.32 --> 2268.48
like part of the essence of basically

2266.8 --> 2272.5600000000004
what it all was

2268.48 --> 2273.2
and then yeah i think that despite what

2272.56 --> 2276.96
happened

2273.2 --> 2281.4399999999996
it could still be

2276.96 --> 2285.28
pumped up rebuilt

2281.44 --> 2287.119
same idea maybe evolved

2285.28 --> 2289.28
like yeah what what happens in a lot of

2287.119 --> 2291.28
time in between it has to be

2289.28 --> 2292.32
it has to still feel real remember the

2291.28 --> 2294.5600000000004
feeling real

2292.32 --> 2295.599
aspect is critical of the theory they

2294.56 --> 2297.92
could do it

2295.599 --> 2299.3590000000004
they could just continue it after all

2297.92 --> 2303.839
despite everything

2299.359 --> 2306.56
but yeah the i don't know

2303.839 --> 2306.56
if they'll do it

2308.8 --> 2312.48
i don't even know if like the the makers

2311.2 --> 2315.04
of the series want

2312.48 --> 2315.04
to do that

2317.92 --> 2322.2400000000002
i'll bet the actors are okay with it

2320.72 --> 2323.4399999999996
from what i've heard they had a great

2322.24 --> 2327.839
time in that

2323.44 --> 2327.839
in making that series

2332.96 --> 2341.839
marina barakin bakarin

2336.64 --> 2341.839
what was that

2347.119 --> 2350.6400000000003
oh yeah yeah

2351.68 --> 2355.839
yeah yeah

2358.1 --> 2361.38
[Music]

2363.2 --> 2370.0
the mistress no no no she played an an

2366.839 --> 2371.68
interstellar guild prostitute

2370.0 --> 2373.04
that you were not allowed to call a

2371.68 --> 2376.56
prostitute

2373.04 --> 2379.04
that's what she was not a mistress

2376.56 --> 2379.7599999999998
she was specifically not she she did not

2379.04 --> 2382.72
accept

2379.76 --> 2384.4
people playing around with her no she

2382.72 --> 2388.48
did things on

2384.4 --> 2388.48
basically on the guild invite

2388.88 --> 2396.1600000000003
you were you're only being nice

2393.119 --> 2399.2000000000003
i know i know

2396.16 --> 2401.68
just firefly bringing up some uh some

2399.2 --> 2401.68
memories

2403.28 --> 2407.599
i have the blu-ray series actually yeah

2406.56 --> 2411.359
i remember it

2407.599 --> 2414.8
that i actually have that

2411.359 --> 2418.72
it's funny let's see i did right

2414.8 --> 2422.48
i must have have it

2418.72 --> 2425.5989999999997
where is it oh wait

2422.48 --> 2428.079
yeah yeah

2425.599 --> 2428.079
there it is

2436.319 --> 2440.4
i think i even opened it i don't know if

2438.8 --> 2444.0
i could play it anymore

2440.4 --> 2453.839
but yeah i'm uh i'm i was quite a

2444.0 --> 2453.839
big fan so yeah i got the blu-ray

2458.319 --> 2462.0
which by the way is extremely

2464.839 --> 2467.839
inconvenient

2475.92 --> 2480.48
also got the extended edition blu-ray

2479.52 --> 2495.839
version that i

2480.48 --> 2495.839
even haven't taken the plastic off

2506.839 --> 2509.839
um

2510.079 --> 2523.8390000000004
hold on guys

2525.44 --> 2530.319
sorry we're wasting everyone's time here

2533.65 --> 2537.839
[Music]

2534.839 --> 2537.839
right

2539.119 --> 2542.6400000000003
all right yeah you know what with the

2540.56 --> 2546.16
blue blue rays

2542.64 --> 2549.359
it's almost like i just want to be able

2546.16 --> 2553.04
to legally download that movie

2549.359 --> 2555.839
or illegally wherever whenever

2553.04 --> 2558.24
without any consequences because i

2555.839 --> 2561.44
officially have it

2558.24 --> 2562.16
so i just want to be able to download it

2561.44 --> 2564.4
on a whim

2562.16 --> 2567.52
without anybody interrupting me telling

2564.4 --> 2570.0
me it's illegal because i have it

2567.52 --> 2571.52
unfortunately yeah it turned out it

2570.0 --> 2573.599
didn't really work like that although

2571.52 --> 2575.68
yeah you know what

2573.599 --> 2578.88
who's gonna get issues with copyrights

2575.68 --> 2580.64
of older movies anyway

2578.88 --> 2582.96
if i would i would just show them this

2580.64 --> 2585.1189999999997
like dude i i got it

2582.96 --> 2587.68
so stop bothering me that i downloaded

2585.119 --> 2587.6800000000003
it one time

2604.0 --> 2608.16
right missouri bear you want scientific

2606.0 --> 2610.0
evidence of what that [ __ ] in the sky

2608.16 --> 2613.52
happens to be

2610.0 --> 2618.64
i'm working on it but yeah

2613.52 --> 2618.64
first thing that's important to work on

2619.599 --> 2623.6800000000003
is realizing that they're not physical

2621.599 --> 2625.92
things in literal location and that they

2623.68 --> 2630.72
have a tendency to either

2625.92 --> 2632.88
blink out of sight or bend

2630.72 --> 2634.0
their angular location in relation to

2632.88 --> 2637.839
the observer when you go

2634.0 --> 2641.2
up really high so yeah

2637.839 --> 2641.2
what is it then right

2642.16 --> 2648.48
if you can't even figure out like

2645.839 --> 2650.0789999999997
like how how is it even possible then

2648.48 --> 2651.52
how are you gonna present scientific

2650.079 --> 2653.92
evidence for it

2651.52 --> 2655.04
you know spurs chemo try to like put

2653.92 --> 2657.6800000000003
that in my shoes

2655.04 --> 2659.44
when i'm not even ready to get close to

2657.68 --> 2661.9199999999996
making a hypothesis

2659.44 --> 2664.16
i'm just conceptualizing with light

2661.92 --> 2666.319
manifesting

2664.16 --> 2668.7999999999997
likely to be electrical in nature

2666.319 --> 2668.8
somehow

2671.68 --> 2674.96
that's the only way it makes sense to me

2674.079 --> 2678.6400000000003
it's the only

2674.96 --> 2680.96
explanation that could explain to me

2678.64 --> 2683.2
fish or in a way in which i could

2680.96 --> 2685.92
visualize that

2683.2 --> 2687.2
you would see light coming from

2685.92 --> 2689.6800000000003
somewhere even though

2687.2 --> 2691.2
in that location where you see there is

2689.68 --> 2693.9199999999996
not a thing from which

2691.2 --> 2693.9199999999996
light shines

2698.56 --> 2702.319
oh thank you amanda young for the five

2700.72 --> 2703.2799999999997
dollar super chat donation i've been

2702.319 --> 2707.2
watching your show

2703.28 --> 2709.6800000000003
for a year some month

2707.2 --> 2719.839
now not a dull moment i thank you thank

2709.68 --> 2719.839
you very much

2720.72 --> 2724.319
i i'm glad that

2725.76 --> 2733.8390000000004
i i'm glad that you appreciate it

2740.64 --> 2744.8799999999997
i could even almost try to draw it what

2743.599 --> 2747.599
do i even mean

2744.88 --> 2748.6400000000003
by light manifesting you know it is

2747.599 --> 2752.56
really difficult

2748.64 --> 2752.56
to even try to visualize that

2754.16 --> 2761.839
let's see if i can quickly quickly just

2756.4 --> 2761.839
scratch something together here

2762.21 --> 2765.349
[Music]

2767.28 --> 2771.119
it's gonna be autographic fuel by the

2768.96 --> 2771.119
way

2771.2 --> 2775.839
okay so in one

2786.4 --> 2789.839
and the other

2791.04 --> 2798.72
oops i think i accidentally drew a curve

2794.079 --> 2802.2400000000002
on my surface yeah

2798.72 --> 2805.2799999999997
and that's by the way because of typical

2802.24 --> 2816.16
elbow rotation effect that's not because

2805.28 --> 2819.44
the surface is naturally curved

2816.16 --> 2819.44
all right that's more like it

2820.24 --> 2831.839
okay so here's the other one

2833.32 --> 2836.4390000000003
[Music]

2842.839 --> 2845.839
okay

2851.119 --> 2859.839
ha i'm gonna draw a dome over this

2861.28 --> 2867.8390000000004
right so okay yeah i have to

2865.359 --> 2870.4
make this more pronounceable you're not

2867.839 --> 2870.4
gonna see

2870.839 --> 2873.839
anything

2874.319 --> 2882.8
right so

2878.16 --> 2882.7999999999997
let's get the old test okay so

2883.2 --> 2890.64
over here there is a ball

2886.64 --> 2890.64
like a lamp is emanating light

2890.88 --> 2898.2400000000002
ah parallel view beams going

2894.319 --> 2900.64
here's a little person mirror view i

2898.24 --> 2902.5589999999997
hate it this goes

2900.64 --> 2904.4
basically yeah so if they're standing

2902.559 --> 2906.48
here it's coming from right above

2904.4 --> 2908.319
they're standing there it's coming from

2906.48 --> 2911.92
ah

2908.319 --> 2914.319
right now there right

2911.92 --> 2916.64
so here on the other side there is no

2914.319 --> 2920.5589999999997
ball

2916.64 --> 2920.5589999999997
it's more like an electrical

2920.72 --> 2923.839
connection that connects up to the dome

2923.52 --> 2926.319
and

2923.839 --> 2928.64
above you don't see it and here when i

2926.319 --> 2931.359
guess there's more atmosphere

2928.64 --> 2931.359
there is

2931.92 --> 2935.28
wow

2933.38 --> 2939.04
[Music]

2935.28 --> 2943.76
could it be a similar effect to

2939.04 --> 2946.88
what causes lightning to be visible

2943.76 --> 2949.92
sounds kind of remote right but

2946.88 --> 2953.2000000000003
lightning is the connection of matter

2949.92 --> 2956.2400000000002
the electricity itself is not visible

2953.2 --> 2956.8799999999997
but because it goes through the gas the

2956.24 --> 2959.52
gas

2956.88 --> 2960.079
because of the electricity then lights

2959.52 --> 2962.8
up

2960.079 --> 2965.2000000000003
and that's what we see that's why we see

2962.8 --> 2969.319
the connection of the electricity

2965.2 --> 2972.319
it's the gas

2969.319 --> 2976.4
electrifying that makes lightning

2972.319 --> 2979.68
have a light flash right so what

2976.4 --> 2980.96
if there is with the top layer wherever

2979.68 --> 2983.1189999999997
that is

2980.96 --> 2984.64
and the ground there is an electrical

2983.119 --> 2988.0
connection

2984.64 --> 2990.4
in a certain pattern in which

2988.0 --> 2991.68
well the presumed to be sun is as it

2990.4 --> 2994.4
were the middle point

2991.68 --> 2995.9199999999996
that moves around and the electrical

2994.4 --> 2998.48
band just goes around the

2995.92 --> 3001.599
electrical connection and because lower

2998.48 --> 3006.8
at the atmosphere there is more gas

3001.599 --> 3006.8
that somehow lights it up

3006.96 --> 3011.04
on the lower part and does not light it

3009.2 --> 3012.0
up on the higher part so that's why you

3011.04 --> 3013.7599999999998
wouldn't see any

3012.0 --> 3015.68
stars of any kind up there because

3013.76 --> 3019.119
there's not enough gas

3015.68 --> 3020.64
to be electrified in order for you to

3019.119 --> 3024.2400000000002
see

3020.64 --> 3027.44
light there even though there should be

3024.24 --> 3030.72
an electrical connection

3027.44 --> 3031.599
right so then the lower you go the more

3030.72 --> 3034.5589999999997
gas there is

3031.599 --> 3035.3590000000004
so the more the electrical connection

3034.559 --> 3039.52
would then

3035.359 --> 3042.64
effectively manifest the light there

3039.52 --> 3047.2
okay this is this is

3042.64 --> 3050.4
rough how i'm putting it down there but

3047.2 --> 3055.839
maybe that is what that is so it's

3050.4 --> 3055.839
almost like a

3056.0 --> 3060.72
a gas lamp just in the atmosphere

3059.92 --> 3064.88
there's a gas

3060.72 --> 3067.52
lamp but it is kind of like

3064.88 --> 3069.44
polarized i guess so it's not just

3067.52 --> 3070.64
radiating in all directions from where

3069.44 --> 3075.119
it's electrified but it's

3070.64 --> 3080.0789999999997
like polarized in some way

3075.119 --> 3083.839
maybe yeah i'm really spitballing here

3080.079 --> 3083.8390000000004
i'm trying to make sense of it

3084.0 --> 3089.359
right because an electrical connection

3086.559 --> 3092.48
does not have to be visible

3089.359 --> 3093.2799999999997
and that takes away or that kind of

3092.48 --> 3096.72
gives it a

3093.28 --> 3098.96
fill in a conceptual fill-in for a

3096.72 --> 3100.9599999999996
possibility of light manifestation

3098.96 --> 3105.839
without a literal

3100.96 --> 3105.839
ball light source from which it comes

3106.079 --> 3109.6800000000003
it could simply be like a lamp lighting

3108.48 --> 3113.839
a gas light

3109.68 --> 3117.52
lamp lighting up in some sort of way

3113.839 --> 3120.7999999999997
but you're basically in the lamp

3117.52 --> 3123.599
see you're in the lamp in the

3120.8 --> 3124.1600000000003
part of the gas that is being lit up so

3123.599 --> 3127.44
there's no

3124.16 --> 3131.1189999999997
tube surrounding the part

3127.44 --> 3133.68
that is lit up it just that part just

3131.119 --> 3133.6800000000003
lights up

3134.319 --> 3139.839
am i connecting with you guys here

3140.319 --> 3144.24
are you understand are you understanding

3143.68 --> 3147.52
like

3144.24 --> 3151.04
how i'm trying to

3147.52 --> 3153.119
reason out how did yeah

3151.04 --> 3154.4
how the sun and all the heavenly bodies

3153.119 --> 3156.88
could be

3154.4 --> 3158.4
not emanating from a source but actually

3156.88 --> 3161.76
just manifest

3158.4 --> 3166.0
by means of electricity

3161.76 --> 3169.119
lighting up the gas locally causing the

3166.0 --> 3169.119
daylight effect

3172.48 --> 3175.599
show it again i don't know if it's gonna

3174.0 --> 3179.44
help a lot

3175.599 --> 3195.839
but i'll just

3179.44 --> 3195.839
pronounce it some more

3203.119 --> 3209.839
i just add them some stuff

3217.92 --> 3226.079
right so

3222.319 --> 3226.079
see maybe this helps a little

3228.88 --> 3233.04
so here would be the point where the

3232.24 --> 3235.359
lights

3233.04 --> 3236.5589999999997
or where the atmosphere did the gas

3235.359 --> 3239.04
within the realm

3236.559 --> 3240.2400000000002
would be thick enough for for the light

3239.04 --> 3243.52
actually to start

3240.24 --> 3244.0
manifesting and then the more you go

3243.52 --> 3247.119
down

3244.0 --> 3249.599
it manifests more it becomes stronger

3247.119 --> 3251.52
and then eventually yeah at ground level

3249.599 --> 3253.839
it becomes

3251.52 --> 3256.319
really strong and that's where all the

3253.839 --> 3258.96
heat then is effectively

3256.319 --> 3258.96
generated

3259.68 --> 3266.24
see you see that and

3263.119 --> 3268.88
here at the top here's the supposed

3266.24 --> 3270.24
top edge or whatever and this part you

3268.88 --> 3279.839
won't see but it is

3270.24 --> 3279.839
electrically connected

3280.079 --> 3286.0
right so who knows

3283.92 --> 3287.04
would it be absolutely weird of me to

3286.0 --> 3291.2
say that

3287.04 --> 3293.7599999999998
maybe gravity cannot be found

3291.2 --> 3294.72
in electrostatics but maybe the

3293.76 --> 3297.76
celestial

3294.72 --> 3301.359
the cause of the celestial

3297.76 --> 3302.1600000000003
lights manifestation including daylight

3301.359 --> 3307.839
and the sun

3302.16 --> 3307.839
might actually be

3309.68 --> 3328.06
right here we go one more time

3321.54 --> 3328.06
[Music]

3337.44 --> 3341.44
he would celestial realms wow i thank

3340.24 --> 3342.8799999999997
you that is

3341.44 --> 3349.839
i don't know if you're right but that's

3342.88 --> 3349.839
quite a compliment if you would

3360.24 --> 3363.839
plasma bubble what

3388.839 --> 3391.839
so

3393.92 --> 3399.92
maybe mark collard i think he was i

3396.4 --> 3402.96
think feynman besides being a methaholic

3399.92 --> 3405.6800000000003
he was really he

3402.96 --> 3406.0
he liked to do kind of what i like to do

3405.68 --> 3408.64
he

3406.0 --> 3410.64
he was really like an explorer he really

3408.64 --> 3414.319
wanted to figure things out

3410.64 --> 3419.839
and he liked that in other people too

3414.319 --> 3419.839
so i don't know

3419.92 --> 3425.2000000000003
but at the same time yeah

3422.96 --> 3427.92
we we could have also gotten into big

3425.2 --> 3427.9199999999996
fights because

3430.48 --> 3433.92
especially if i start dissing on quantum

3432.48 --> 3437.68
mechanics

3433.92 --> 3447.2000000000003
this is which i will continue doing

3437.68 --> 3449.52
but carefully

3447.2 --> 3451.7599999999998
not saying it doesn't work just saying

3449.52 --> 3451.7599999999998
that

3453.52 --> 3458.4
yeah like the backdrop assumptions may

3458.079 --> 3460.88
not

3458.4 --> 3462.88
be entirely correct and presuppositional

3460.88 --> 3466.079
in certain details

3462.88 --> 3468.4
and i've explained that it's just i know

3466.079 --> 3469.92
qe gets all pissed off every time he

3468.4 --> 3473.599
hears me say that

3469.92 --> 3475.28
so i try not to do that in this present

3473.599 --> 3477.52
but i don't know maybe feynman would

3475.28 --> 3481.52
have actually appreciated

3477.52 --> 3481.52
if i would suggest such a thing i don't

3486.839 --> 3489.839
know

3500.14 --> 3503.27
[Music]

3511.2 --> 3513.52
great

3514.839 --> 3531.839
oh well now we're already

3538.4 --> 3544.2400000000002
right it's really funny now i think

3541.04 --> 3545.599
about this concept again you know if it

3544.24 --> 3548.9199999999996
is electrically

3545.599 --> 3550.2400000000002
if it is indeed lying in the

3548.92 --> 3553.6800000000003
electrification of

3550.24 --> 3556.72
gas locally like a lamp or like

3553.68 --> 3556.72
lightning lights up

3556.839 --> 3559.839
right

3561.92 --> 3569.6800000000003
then maybe the pattern of it

3567.44 --> 3572.0
maybe the very frequencies in the

3569.68 --> 3575.839
pattern of the tension electricity

3572.0 --> 3575.839
whatever exactly is causing that

3576.319 --> 3579.52
functions in such a way that it will

3579.119 --> 3582.079
just

3579.52 --> 3585.68
automatically create the entire globe of

3582.079 --> 3589.2000000000003
the heavens including the stars at night

3585.68 --> 3592.799
as indeed like a plasma hologram

3589.2 --> 3600.16
effect that you just pick up locally

3592.799 --> 3615.839
when you are in the lid apart

3600.16 --> 3615.839
that actually halfway makes sense to me

3620.36 --> 3626.839
[Music]

3622.559 --> 3629.8390000000004
i have to give that some time to think

3626.839 --> 3629.839
about

3633.92 --> 3638.319
fire needs oxygen to burst cause heat

3636.24 --> 3642.319
that's right a man like me

3638.319 --> 3643.7599999999998
the thing is a lamp a gas lamp being

3642.319 --> 3647.599
electrified

3643.76 --> 3647.599
does not need oxygen

3648.96 --> 3654.559
it doesn't need any chemicals

3652.0 --> 3657.599
any alteration of the gases it just

3654.559 --> 3661.92
needs the electricity to go through it

3657.599 --> 3661.92
and that alone will alter it

3662.88 --> 3671.839
will alter the light condition

3674.18 --> 3679.7799999999997
[Music]

3683.599 --> 3688.079
the light the fire with the battery and

3685.2 --> 3699.839
the gum wrapper and right

3688.079 --> 3699.8390000000004
yeah sparks

3712.72 --> 3718.7599999999998
yeah right stove cooking

3715.61 --> 3718.76
[Music]

3729.839 --> 3737.119
where's that heat coming from right

3733.039 --> 3740.1600000000003
well did you know that in a lamp

3737.119 --> 3743.2000000000003
right a gas lamp

3740.16 --> 3746.8799999999997
that the electricity goes through it

3743.2 --> 3748.0
right lights up yeah and that light will

3746.88 --> 3750.6400000000003
include

3748.0 --> 3752.16
even some warmth it will include some

3750.64 --> 3753.68
heat even that light

3752.16 --> 3755.52
even though there is no chemical

3753.68 --> 3758.5589999999997
reaction happening there

3755.52 --> 3761.359
there's just electric tension in there

3758.559 --> 3761.3590000000004
electricity

3762.48 --> 3769.28
so where's the heat coming from well

3765.76 --> 3772.88
from the light which would come

3769.28 --> 3778.079
from the electric electricity

3772.88 --> 3778.079
tension source whatever is causing it

3780.799 --> 3786.24
i yeah i i compared it earlier to the

3783.839 --> 3787.839
realm being like a microwave literally

3786.24 --> 3789.359
just these fields of tension going

3787.839 --> 3790.64
through that yeah microwaves are used to

3789.359 --> 3792.96
heat things up

3790.64 --> 3792.96
right

3794.96 --> 3811.839
no lamp doing that

3815.28 --> 3824.079
right and besides literal heat sources

3819.68 --> 3827.44
right so imagine a a hearthfire

3824.079 --> 3830.799
no if it's dark

3827.44 --> 3833.039
then you can see a yeah if

3830.799 --> 3834.88
a campfire or whatever a hearthfi you

3833.039 --> 3835.3590000000004
can see that at quite a long distance

3834.88 --> 3838.7200000000003
right

3835.359 --> 3841.359
right if it's dark

3838.72 --> 3844.0789999999997
anybody can see it at quite a distance

3841.359 --> 3848.0
can you feel the heat

3844.079 --> 3848.0
off that light though

3848.48 --> 3855.52
not so much right unless you get

3851.52 --> 3858.079
really really really close

3855.52 --> 3860.72
and it doesn't even matter like if it's

3858.079 --> 3864.4
super summery warm

3860.72 --> 3865.4399999999996
or if it's wintry cold you cannot feel

3864.4 --> 3867.28
that heat

3865.44 --> 3870.48
from that fire even though you can see

3867.28 --> 3870.48
it quite a distance

3871.2 --> 3878.0
so how can

3874.4 --> 3881.119
heat then transfer

3878.0 --> 3885.28
from an from a visual object

3881.119 --> 3885.28
in a very very very far distance

3885.599 --> 3896.96
like that that doesn't make any sense

3894.4 --> 3898.64
but hey if light is manifesting

3896.96 --> 3902.96
including infrared light

3898.64 --> 3906.4
due to the electrifying of gas locally

3902.96 --> 3909.599
giving off a hologram

3906.4 --> 3912.2400000000002
like effect that we

3909.599 --> 3914.079
identify as the globe of the heavens

3912.24 --> 3917.5989999999997
well then it's literally just

3914.079 --> 3922.559
electricity locally creating that heat

3917.599 --> 3925.92
in the form of local light manifest

3922.559 --> 3926.559
it doesn't have it's not heat included

3925.92 --> 3928.96
in light

3926.559 --> 3929.599
traveling extremely far away because

3928.96 --> 3933.92
that's not

3929.599 --> 3937.2000000000003
it doesn't work like that it doesn't

3933.92 --> 3940.319
like it's extremely hard even with a

3937.2 --> 3942.319
laser that is extreme that's very strong

3940.319 --> 3944.0
to heat something up over incredible

3942.319 --> 3946.799
distances unless that is

3944.0 --> 3947.359
yeah it is a laser specifically designed

3946.799 --> 3950.16
not

3947.359 --> 3950.799
to be parallel and all that it's very

3950.16 --> 3954.64
tough

3950.799 --> 3957.839
wow if it's very close yeah bang

3954.64 --> 3962.4
goes very quickly but yeah distance

3957.839 --> 3965.359
and heat matters a lot

3962.4 --> 3966.2400000000002
so even if heat is transferred through

3965.359 --> 3969.5989999999997
infrared

3966.24 --> 3972.9599999999996
accompanied by other light

3969.599 --> 3976.48
it's not just going to unlimitedly

3972.96 --> 3976.48
move move on

3976.72 --> 3981.4399999999996
and and lose no heat it's not it doesn't

3979.52 --> 3985.28
do that

3981.44 --> 3987.359
every particle every gas particle

3985.28 --> 3991.52
everything the light has to transfer

3987.359 --> 3994.64
through some of it will be absorbed now

3991.52 --> 3996.319
the actual visual lights well they are

3994.64 --> 3999.0389999999998
only really absorbed by things that are

3996.319 --> 4003.44
not perfectly transparent

3999.039 --> 4005.599
heat i don't think infrared

4003.44 --> 4007.2000000000003
passes through matter as easily i think

4005.599 --> 4010.079
that if you shine infrared

4007.2 --> 4010.5589999999997
through perfectly transparent water

4010.079 --> 4013.28
there's

4010.559 --> 4015.92
none of it gonna come through it's all

4013.28 --> 4019.599
going to be absorbed by the water

4015.92 --> 4019.599
even though it is transparent

4019.76 --> 4025.92
now i might be off with this

4022.96 --> 4026.64
but i think there is something there

4025.92 --> 4028.96
there is

4026.64 --> 4030.48
yeah some of it might actually go

4028.96 --> 4033.52
through i don't know i've never seen an

4030.48 --> 4036.72
experiment try that

4033.52 --> 4039.599
but yeah i all i know

4036.72 --> 4040.8799999999997
in general is that heat really no matter

4039.599 --> 4043.44
in what form it is

4040.88 --> 4044.799
it decreases over distance because there

4043.44 --> 4049.839
if there's matter in between

4044.799 --> 4049.839
that matter will absorb that heat

4050.799 --> 4057.319
well with the more visual visible light

4054.24 --> 4059.1189999999997
types no it passes through it and only

4057.319 --> 4062.319
transparentness

4059.119 --> 4064.2400000000002
opacity matters to that

4062.319 --> 4066.24
it's not going to lose energy if if

4064.24 --> 4077.839
there's nothing visually

4066.24 --> 4077.839
being absorbed or what is it refracted

4088.96 --> 4093.92
now a man like me no

4092.0 --> 4098.0
you don't feel the heat of the sun

4093.92 --> 4098.0
nobody feels the heat of the sun

4098.239 --> 4105.199
the sun is not a thing it's not a

4101.759 --> 4106.48
thing radiating heat it's a visual

4105.199 --> 4109.839
apparition

4106.48 --> 4111.678999999999
you see when you look in the direction

4109.839 --> 4115.679
of where the daylight is coming from

4111.679 --> 4115.679
in relation to your specific position

4117.04 --> 4122.319
because if it had an actual extreme this

4120.0 --> 4127.12
even 3 000 miles

4122.319 --> 4130.159000000001
would be way too far it would be too far

4127.12 --> 4132.96
the heat could not travel that distance

4130.159 --> 4133.92
without just being absorbed and besides

4132.96 --> 4137.52
if it could

4133.92 --> 4137.52
travel that far

4137.92 --> 4141.64
even three thousand miles that far to

4140.719 --> 4145.92
have

4141.64 --> 4147.1990000000005
radiation literal being in the direct

4145.92 --> 4150.159
radiation heat

4147.199 --> 4152.879999999999
of a ball sun 3000 miles if that could

4150.159 --> 4155.5199999999995
reach us literally

4152.88 --> 4157.04
i think that the earth would constantly

4155.52 --> 4158.799000000001
be scorched

4157.04 --> 4161.12
like really scorched if there was

4158.799 --> 4163.679
actually actually proximity heat that

4161.12 --> 4167.199
could reach

4163.679 --> 4167.1990000000005
to ground level like that

4167.52 --> 4172.319
i don't think so and then yeah what do

4169.52 --> 4172.319
you do if you go up

4172.88 --> 4177.679
makes no sense if you're gonna

4175.279 --> 4182.0
supposedly go closer to the sun

4177.679 --> 4185.279
then why do you cool off

4182.0 --> 4187.52
because the air is colder

4185.279 --> 4190.64
right it's colder so why is all that

4187.52 --> 4194.64
heat all being absorbed on ground level

4190.64 --> 4196.96
and not closer to the presupposed ball

4194.64 --> 4196.96
sun

4198.48 --> 4204.48
aren't you cooking when you're up there

4201.36 --> 4204.48
when the sun is shining

4205.28 --> 4213.44
i'm pretty sure the heat is all even

4208.56 --> 4215.92
manifested and absorbed at ground level

4213.44 --> 4217.839999999999
it's not have it's there's no proximity

4215.92 --> 4220.32
heat radiation

4217.84 --> 4220.96
that doesn't exist you have no evidence

4220.32 --> 4224.799999999999
no

4220.96 --> 4224.8
evidence whatsoever

4227.199 --> 4234.159
no evidence

4231.04 --> 4236.88
but hey if you want to show me some

4234.159 --> 4238.5599999999995
actually valid and not some nasa data

4236.88 --> 4242.0
saying blah blah

4238.56 --> 4243.6
of literal distances from ground level

4242.0 --> 4246.0
in a certain time of day in a certain

4243.6 --> 4249.4400000000005
place then every distance

4246.0 --> 4252.32
above a temperature reading

4249.44 --> 4254.239
and then show me how it gets hotter when

4252.32 --> 4257.199
you get closer to the sun

4254.239 --> 4258.0
you show me that i don't think so i

4257.199 --> 4261.36
don't think that

4258.0 --> 4266.64
that exists no the heat

4261.36 --> 4266.639999999999
is all at ground level all of it

4267.199 --> 4270.239
that's why mountaintops have snow on

4269.36 --> 4273.679
them

4270.239 --> 4277.36
even in the summer because the heat

4273.679 --> 4280.64
is created at ground level

4277.36 --> 4283.199
it doesn't radiate from a ball high

4280.64 --> 4285.76
up there all the way to ground level

4283.199 --> 4287.599999999999
only to only manifest at ground level no

4285.76 --> 4290.2390000000005
no no no no

4287.6 --> 4290.719
there's a heat element literally like a

4290.239 --> 4293.919999999999
ra

4290.719 --> 4296.88
a red hot iron thing

4293.92 --> 4296.88
just metaphorical

4297.36 --> 4301.759999999999
that is so hot that it would literally

4300.4 --> 4304.799999999999
have a radiate

4301.76 --> 4305.92
distance all the way to the earth's

4304.8 --> 4307.84
surface

4305.92 --> 4308.96
right if that was the case that's up

4307.84 --> 4312.56
there

4308.96 --> 4315.84
then there would be no snow on mountains

4312.56 --> 4315.84
none whatsoever

4317.92 --> 4324.88
because it would be hotter closer

4321.199 --> 4329.199
to it instead of the furthest away

4324.88 --> 4331.12
at ground level

4329.199 --> 4333.04
and there would probably be a lot of

4331.12 --> 4334.8
heat turbulence surrounding the sun as

4333.04 --> 4336.48
well

4334.8 --> 4338.400000000001
because it's constantly heating up that

4336.48 --> 4342.959999999999
air locally around it that

4338.4 --> 4346.4
see no

4342.96 --> 4347.679
sun is not a ball of fire not 3 000

4346.4 --> 4351.44
miles away

4347.679 --> 4355.4400000000005
not millions miles away it's not a thing

4351.44 --> 4371.839999999999
it's an apparition it's an effect

4355.44 --> 4371.839999999999
a side effect an optical side effect

4373.199 --> 4376.4
if clouds are water how do they float

4375.199 --> 4378.799999999999
well because

4376.4 --> 4380.639999999999
the state in which that water is is

4378.8 --> 4382.320000000001
still less dense than the air that

4380.64 --> 4383.679
surrounds it so it kind of finds a

4382.32 --> 4387.679
buoyancy

4383.679 --> 4388.88
point there a relative density

4387.679 --> 4390.719
equilibrium

4388.88 --> 4399.84
with the gases surrounding and that's

4390.719 --> 4399.84
how clouds stay afloat

4411.679 --> 4414.8
yeah mark call it yeah yeah that's yeah

4414.32 --> 4417.28
but

4414.8 --> 4420.64
those type of simple questions are real

4417.28 --> 4427.84
mind breakers for some teachers

4420.64 --> 4427.84
you know

4429.76 --> 4433.6
we know the noble gases oh wait it's a

4432.08 --> 4436.32
different question sorry

4433.6 --> 4436.88
we know the noble gases give off light

4436.32 --> 4438.88
need

4436.88 --> 4440.400000000001
in the presence of an intense magnetic

4438.88 --> 4443.28
field right

4440.4 --> 4443.28
yeah exactly

4443.92 --> 4448.159
heat could be from the upper atmosphere

4446.48 --> 4451.599999999999
interacting with the sun's magnetic

4448.159 --> 4455.12
what no

4451.6 --> 4457.120000000001
there is no sun's magnetic field

4455.12 --> 4459.12
there's there the sun is not a thing

4457.12 --> 4462.32
it's not an emanation point

4459.12 --> 4465.44
more colored the sun is not

4462.32 --> 4468.32
a point

4465.44 --> 4469.28
it's an effect there is nothing

4468.32 --> 4483.84
emanating

4469.28 --> 4483.84
from a point that results in daylight

4494.84 --> 4497.84
hey

4503.44 --> 4507.199
using their points again well you got to

4504.96 --> 4510.4
be careful you know because you're in my

4507.199 --> 4512.639999999999
chat this is and i'm discussing this

4510.4 --> 4516.0
subject right now

4512.64 --> 4516.0
so i'm not a glober

4518.96 --> 4522.96
right but look the noble gases idea it

4521.92 --> 4526.719
is kind of how

4522.96 --> 4529.679
i came to this i described it so

4526.719 --> 4531.44
the gases are all in within the top

4529.679 --> 4533.6
layer bottom layer

4531.44 --> 4535.5199999999995
there should be some kind of electrical

4533.6 --> 4539.84
tension in a certain way

4535.52 --> 4539.84
that connects to the earth

4540.08 --> 4545.679
like this connects to the earth

4543.12 --> 4546.88
and then when the gases are in there's

4545.679 --> 4549.28
enough gas

4546.88 --> 4550.08
for the light to manifest it will start

4549.28 --> 4554.0
to become

4550.08 --> 4556.5599999999995
visible to those who have eyes those

4554.0 --> 4558.32
who have senses to pick up light it will

4556.56 --> 4559.92
start to manifest at some point when the

4558.32 --> 4562.88
gases are

4559.92 --> 4563.679
thick enough to start manifesting that

4562.88 --> 4567.1990000000005
light and then

4563.679 --> 4570.159
as you go downwards gas gets thicker

4567.199 --> 4571.759999999999
more light manifests there until at

4570.159 --> 4575.199
ground level

4571.76 --> 4576.08
you see a big bright thing up above you

4575.199 --> 4578.719
and it's like oh

4576.08 --> 4579.6
this thing seems so close by it feels so

4578.719 --> 4581.76
hot

4579.6 --> 4583.52
right that's exactly what it feels like

4581.76 --> 4587.1990000000005
right i

4583.52 --> 4589.280000000001
that thing is very far away

4587.199 --> 4591.199
and at ground level when you're like oh

4589.28 --> 4592.8
my god the sun is like scorching it

4591.199 --> 4596.32
feels like it's right here

4592.8 --> 4596.88
right right it feels right here that's

4596.32 --> 4600.08
what you

4596.88 --> 4603.4400000000005
feel makes no sense well then you go

4600.08 --> 4606.64
up the mountain and you go two miles up

4603.44 --> 4608.32
guess what it's like yeah the sun is

4606.64 --> 4611.92
there i can feel the heat

4608.32 --> 4613.92
but it doesn't feel like it's here

4611.92 --> 4615.84
it's more like yeah it's up there

4613.92 --> 4618.0
because it's colder everywhere and

4615.84 --> 4621.84
you're higher up

4618.0 --> 4624.56
so maybe you

4621.84 --> 4626.159000000001
the sun is so close to you when you like

4624.56 --> 4627.76
walk at ground level in the desert or

4626.159 --> 4631.92
whatever

4627.76 --> 4635.04
because the actual heat manifestation

4631.92 --> 4637.84
is generated more intensely

4635.04 --> 4637.84
close to you

4638.56 --> 4646.159000000001
right the heat

4642.239 --> 4651.839999999999
is actually generated pretty much

4646.159 --> 4651.839999999999
right there with you

4655.92 --> 4660.32
what is photosynth what does that got to

4657.92 --> 4664.08
do with it

4660.32 --> 4666.799999999999
the photosynthetic photosynthesis

4664.08 --> 4667.679
is the absorption of light and using it

4666.8 --> 4671.1990000000005
as an

4667.679 --> 4674.2390000000005
effect to create a chemical reaction

4671.199 --> 4676.32
right so if habit did i

4674.239 --> 4678.5599999999995
end point claim that there is no light

4676.32 --> 4681.92
involved that light is not

4678.56 --> 4684.64
being absorbed or is that

4681.92 --> 4686.56
just your straw man insertion again

4684.64 --> 4690.08
because you cannot handle

4686.56 --> 4693.6
that the sun is not a physical object

4690.08 --> 4695.44
is that it or or did you just

4693.6 --> 4697.280000000001
come in again and you haven't listened

4695.44 --> 4698.0
to anything i've said in the last 30

4697.28 --> 4707.84
minutes

4698.0 --> 4707.84
is that it

4713.199 --> 4721.839999999999
yeah hold on

4732.159 --> 4735.199
oh goody they're going to drill in the

4733.679 --> 4738.4
wall

4735.199 --> 4741.28
well if it's going to be bad i'm going

4738.4 --> 4741.28
to round out the show

4743.28 --> 4747.04
no we have but the sun is not a solid

4746.0 --> 4748.719
object

4747.04 --> 4751.44
you haven't listened to a word i said

4748.719 --> 4753.84
you haven't even gone along

4751.44 --> 4755.5199999999995
i'm i'm almost ready to ban you now for

4753.84 --> 4759.4400000000005
that [ __ ]

4755.52 --> 4759.84
i literally did a 40-minute report about

4759.44 --> 4762.96
this

4759.84 --> 4764.8
with drawings i made on the spot and you

4762.96 --> 4765.44
haven't listened to a [ __ ] word i

4764.8 --> 4768.08
said

4765.44 --> 4768.08
you have a

4769.36 --> 4780.08
so correct yourself right now

4777.76 --> 4782.719
all right that's a timeout the next time

4780.08 --> 4782.719
it's banned

4785.04 --> 4790.64
i'm not here to hear your side

4788.159 --> 4793.28
of how you think it's supposed to be in

4790.64 --> 4797.1990000000005
the freaking heliocentric model

4793.28 --> 4800.4
we don't give a [ __ ] it's [ __ ]

4797.199 --> 4802.239
everything about it is wrong i'm just

4800.4 --> 4804.239
trying to figure out what it could

4802.239 --> 4807.36
actually be

4804.239 --> 4808.959999999999
right we've already bypassed any type of

4807.36 --> 4812.0
straw man

4808.96 --> 4814.159
disc earth conceptions that you

4812.0 --> 4815.92
globbers love to smash us around in the

4814.159 --> 4818.4
face with constantly

4815.92 --> 4820.8
because it seems so ridiculous to you

4818.4 --> 4822.239
right i've already bypassed that so do

4820.8 --> 4825.360000000001
not

4822.239 --> 4827.44
after everything i sent here insert your

4825.36 --> 4830.48
heliocentric [ __ ]

4827.44 --> 4830.48
we don't need to hear it

4830.84 --> 4847.1990000000005
oh okay gaining wisdom thank you

4834.96 --> 4851.76
i'll check it out

4847.199 --> 4854.0
whoa sheesh

4851.76 --> 4855.84
starting to get rich here guys this is

4854.0 --> 4858.08
getting crazy

4855.84 --> 4860.56
nah just kidding keep it keep it coming

4858.08 --> 4864.96
but yeah thank you gaining wisdom

4860.56 --> 4867.280000000001
34 and a half euros man

4864.96 --> 4870.8
this is like this is another one of

4867.28 --> 4870.8
those big income days for me

4872.84 --> 4875.84
poof

4877.92 --> 4882.2390000000005
thank you so much gaining wisdom i know

4880.639 --> 4884.2390000000005
gaining wisdom has been a long

4882.239 --> 4886.08
a long time supporter by the way he's

4884.239 --> 4888.959999999999
also been one of the first who's been

4886.08 --> 4890.8
part of my patreon

4888.96 --> 4892.08
thank you for that gaining wisdom i

4890.8 --> 4893.679
really appreciate it

4892.08 --> 4895.44
you're always welcome here and you can

i might not respond for a while but i do

4899.199 --> 4903.04
keep track of that [ __ ]

4900.88 --> 4905.52
so thank you so much for the support and

4903.04 --> 4908.44
thanks everyone else for all the support

4905.52 --> 4911.040000000001
it's awesome really really nice

4908.44 --> 4912.5599999999995
[Music]

4911.04 --> 4916.56
thunderbolts project just had an

4912.56 --> 4920.320000000001
interesting upload did they

4916.56 --> 4924.320000000001
could you link that up or is it a

4920.32 --> 4924.32
subscriber only type of situation

4924.88 --> 4929.89
on a site i don't know if you can share

4928.0 --> 4932.969
a video about that oh there they go

4929.89 --> 4932.969
[Music]

5035.28 --> 5045.759999999999
and i'm back that didn't take too long

5043.04 --> 5049.12
oh ah okay thank you for the link hana

5045.76 --> 5049.12
koala i'll check that out

5051.28 --> 5055.12
see the title for starters

5055.36 --> 5062.239
stellar evolution theory false i

5058.48 --> 5065.5199999999995
just muted it stutter evolution theory

5062.239 --> 5068.959999999999
falsified space news

5065.52 --> 5070.96
stellar evolution hmm

5068.96 --> 5074.08
sounds still like they're galactically

5070.96 --> 5074.08
presupposing a lot

5078.96 --> 5082.0
oh this is fun

5082.4 --> 5086.5599999999995
oh they're actually talking about the

5083.92 --> 5091.84
scientific method here

5086.56 --> 5091.84
does that mean that hmm

5096.84 --> 5100.2390000000005
okay

5098.0 --> 5104.0
this is interesting this may actually be

5100.239 --> 5106.32
a no universe type of video

5104.0 --> 5108.08
i'll definitely check that out after the

5106.32 --> 5112.48
show

5108.08 --> 5115.36
i'll just show a short image

5112.48 --> 5115.36
hey come on

5115.92 --> 5118.4
what the

5119.92 --> 5122.639
oh right right

5124.96 --> 5132.0
just just just the text

5128.239 --> 5132.0
anybody heard of karl popper

5132.08 --> 5135.6
probably i think he's pretty famous

5134.4 --> 5137.679
anyway yeah this is

5135.6 --> 5140.400000000001
i scrolled in the video and then i put

5137.679 --> 5143.04
this popped up

5140.4 --> 5145.199
i thought that's not worthy karl popper

5143.04 --> 5146.08
believed that in order for a theory to

5145.199 --> 5148.638999999999
be considered

5146.08 --> 5149.6
signs it had to be falsifiable or

5148.639 --> 5151.1990000000005
testable

5149.6 --> 5154.320000000001
if you are unable to do those things

5151.199 --> 5156.719
then it would be considered non-science

5154.32 --> 5158.0
pseudoscience he also introduced that

5156.719 --> 5163.76
observations could

5158.0 --> 5163.76
only be used as a means to falsify

5166.84 --> 5174.159000000001
that's okay i don't know if that's

5170.48 --> 5178.4
i don't know what qe would think of that

5174.159 --> 5178.4
it at least almost sounds reasonable

5178.48 --> 5183.839999999999
although he didn't say very manipulate

5182.0 --> 5185.92
specifically and that is what it is

5183.84 --> 5190.639
specifically so

5185.92 --> 5190.639
anyway that was in there

5190.96 --> 5197.84
oh check it out it's a six minute 33

5193.52 --> 5197.84
second video so it's not that long

5205.6 --> 5210.4800000000005
oh right yeah george sanford it is

5208.84 --> 5213.92
probably

5210.48 --> 5215.44
in concrete it sounded like it was

5213.92 --> 5225.84
really hard otherwise they would have

5215.44 --> 5225.839999999999
gone in there really quickly

5230.4 --> 5234.159
those lightning guys still believe the

5232.48 --> 5236.159
earth is a globe right

5234.159 --> 5240.48
yeah i know but yeah you gotta hold on

5236.159 --> 5244.32
somewhere right it's just another tear

5240.48 --> 5247.28
so they're basically doing everything

5244.32 --> 5249.92
trying to recreate it all but without

5247.28 --> 5252.639
the earth being flat and contained

5249.92 --> 5253.04
and that's their vantage point that's

5252.639 --> 5256.0
where

5253.04 --> 5257.44
they do their thing and they are trying

5256.0 --> 5260.0
to refigure out the

5257.44 --> 5261.839999999999
well the blatantly obvious electrical

5260.0 --> 5263.36
involvement the electrical nature of the

5261.84 --> 5265.28
realm

5263.36 --> 5267.839999999999
but yeah they're still holding on to the

5265.28 --> 5267.84
ball

5272.96 --> 5280.4
uh ichabo what what what's this

5276.56 --> 5284.080000000001
what's this attitude

5280.4 --> 5287.599999999999
echo chamber echo chamber you say

5284.08 --> 5288.719
you mean me as an individual doing

5287.6 --> 5291.120000000001
hangouts

5288.719 --> 5292.84
putting down ideas that are kind of

5291.12 --> 5297.679
complex

5292.84 --> 5301.360000000001
then you not giving any feedback

5297.679 --> 5301.92
not even like hmm i disagree or no no no

5301.36 --> 5305.12
you

5301.92 --> 5308.2390000000005
ignored it and then you started to it

5305.12 --> 5312.4
insert your

5308.239 --> 5315.199
obvious globe based beliefs

5312.4 --> 5317.12
now that's called disrespectful that's

5315.199 --> 5319.12
what the trolls that flair of debates

5317.12 --> 5320.8
are doing so i don't know if you just

5319.12 --> 5323.28
can't do this anymore i have it

5320.8 --> 5324.4800000000005
if you're done with my show then maybe

5323.28 --> 5327.44
you should just leave

5324.48 --> 5328.638999999999
and not come back because this is not

5327.44 --> 5332.638999999999
how i want people

5328.639 --> 5334.4800000000005
in my chat to act it's as simple as that

5332.639 --> 5336.2390000000005
yeah you did ignore it because you

5334.48 --> 5339.04
didn't give any feedback

5336.239 --> 5339.839999999999
you only inserted your globe nonsense

5339.04 --> 5343.36
which you

5339.84 --> 5346.08
know we are going to reject outright

5343.36 --> 5348.159
for blatantly obvious reasons that are

5346.08 --> 5351.12
treated on a daily basis

5348.159 --> 5352.48
for years now and if you can't handle

5351.12 --> 5355.76
that

5352.48 --> 5357.199
then maybe you do need to go you know

5355.76 --> 5359.4400000000005
if you want to believe in the globe

5357.199 --> 5362.4
that's one thing but when i'm

5359.44 --> 5364.08
figuring out the nature of the realm you

5362.4 --> 5367.28
are not here to insert

5364.08 --> 5370.8
your concepts of heliocentric belief

5367.28 --> 5379.84
when i do that all right

5370.8 --> 5379.84
all right goodbye then

5382.719 --> 5388.53
that was that you know i guess

5386.0 --> 5391.44
at some point they just run out

5388.53 --> 5394.96
[Music]

5391.44 --> 5394.96
i can't say i won't miss you

5395.199 --> 5401.678999999999
but yeah that was completely useless

5398.96 --> 5405.44
you wasted my time wasted everybody's

5401.679 --> 5405.4400000000005
time and you have a shitty attitude

5405.679 --> 5408.96
and it's unacceptable

5415.76 --> 5419.280000000001
i'm figuring things out from scratch in

5417.92 --> 5422.639
a very

5419.28 --> 5426.239
very difficult on the edge

5422.639 --> 5430.0
of thinking new approach

5426.239 --> 5433.199
that most people just blatantly reject

5430.0 --> 5434.0
and even ridicule me for even though

5433.199 --> 5435.839999999999
they don't [ __ ]

5434.0 --> 5437.6
understand what i'm even saying i'm

5435.84 --> 5438.8
putting it down here i'm trying to build

5437.6 --> 5443.52
something

5438.8 --> 5446.96
and i don't need your heliocentric

5443.52 --> 5448.159000000001
rhetoric to shove that all aside that

5446.96 --> 5451.52
very meticulous

5448.159 --> 5463.839999999999
careful hard to do thinking work

5451.52 --> 5463.84
all right ichaba thank you very much

5465.52 --> 5469.040000000001
if you want to talk about how the sun's

5467.28 --> 5471.28
supposed to work

5469.04 --> 5472.56
in your heliocentric model and we're the

5471.28 --> 5474.0
oddities with that

5472.56 --> 5475.76
well why don't you just go over to

5474.0 --> 5478.32
jose's

5475.76 --> 5480.159000000001
or maybe just hang around in the after

5478.32 --> 5482.48
show panel on discord with

5480.159 --> 5484.4
chike and xanax and all that you know

5482.48 --> 5486.0
they love to talk about that [ __ ]

5484.4 --> 5487.5199999999995
they don't want to talk about other

5486.0 --> 5490.4
possibilities

5487.52 --> 5492.159000000001
they just want to ridicule it right so

5490.4 --> 5493.679
why don't you just go there then

5492.159 --> 5496.159
if you don't like it here anymore if you

5493.679 --> 5504.08
don't want to actually hear

5496.159 --> 5506.96
on the edge new ideas and conceptions

5504.08 --> 5506.96
i'm not muted

5508.639 --> 5519.84
no way i'm not muted

5529.199 --> 5533.36
i can still see the sound here going up

5532.48 --> 5535.199
and down

5533.36 --> 5537.5199999999995
although my volume may be a little bit

5535.199 --> 5537.5199999999995
low

5542.32 --> 5546.239
i'm sorry there ah

5547.12 --> 5551.84
no but guys don't don't kick him in the

5549.76 --> 5554.320000000001
back too much please

5551.84 --> 5555.360000000001
this is just an attitude problem you

5554.32 --> 5558.5599999999995
know

5555.36 --> 5560.639
and everybody even flat earthers

5558.56 --> 5563.4400000000005
have these types of things every now and

5560.639 --> 5565.52
then remember

5563.44 --> 5566.879999999999
so he may just not be in the mood for it

5565.52 --> 5569.6
but he should learn

5566.88 --> 5571.1990000000005
if you're not in the mood for it then

5569.6 --> 5574.639
don't come here

5571.199 --> 5577.678999999999
then just take a break

5574.639 --> 5578.56
because if you're just going to not be

5577.679 --> 5581.84
interested and

5578.56 --> 5583.360000000001
insert stuff which you know is not the

5581.84 --> 5586.08
place for it

5583.36 --> 5586.08
then yeah

5587.28 --> 5593.599999999999
it's better to to just not come and now

5590.719 --> 5595.199
you did it and now you're banned right

5593.6 --> 5596.96
and you're gonna probably gonna be sorry

5595.199 --> 5600.239
tomorrow or whenever

5596.96 --> 5604.08
or maybe it's now over

5600.239 --> 5606.4
i i don't really care either way

5604.08 --> 5608.239
but yeah you got yourself banned that

5606.4 --> 5610.879999999999
that was completely useless you didn't

5608.239 --> 5610.879999999999
need to do that

5614.639 --> 5619.76
right and anybody's gonna call this an

5617.679 --> 5624.96
echo chamber you're out of your

5619.76 --> 5624.96
mind an echo for what

5625.12 --> 5630.159
ninety percent of people in the world if

5627.679 --> 5632.32
not more don't even understand what the

5630.159 --> 5635.199
[ __ ] i'm talking about how is this an

5632.32 --> 5635.199
echo chamber

5639.679 --> 5645.84
it's ridiculous

5649.48 --> 5656.308999999999
[Music]

5660.639 --> 5663.84
oh yeah you put it on halt yeah that

5662.48 --> 5667.759999999999
happens

5663.84 --> 5670.0
yeah when you get uh is it a bell

5667.76 --> 5672.0
a bell notification notification and you

5670.0 --> 5673.92
click it and then you actually click

5672.0 --> 5676.0
on one of the links to see for example

5673.92 --> 5677.36
what a comment is yeah then the video

5676.0 --> 5679.52
stops

5677.36 --> 5681.28
really freaking annoying that it happens

5679.52 --> 5682.8
and it happens always you can't turn it

5681.28 --> 5684.96
off

5682.8 --> 5686.56
that's one of the most annoying things

5684.96 --> 5688.56
that youtube has done it's been there

5686.56 --> 5690.8
for a while

5688.56 --> 5692.8
because then yeah if you just want to

5690.8 --> 5695.04
check your notifications you must

5692.8 --> 5696.320000000001
open a new window and do it there

5695.04 --> 5699.119
because if you're

5696.32 --> 5700.719
watching something live it's going to go

5699.119 --> 5701.5199999999995
on pause and there's nothing you can do

5700.719 --> 5705.44
to stop

5701.52 --> 5715.84
it from doing that really annoying

5705.44 --> 5715.839999999999
no need for it

5734.74 --> 5743.84
[Music]

5740.84 --> 5743.84
hmm

5749.04 --> 5753.28
so was he having the last global in my

5751.119 --> 5753.839999999999
chat now i'm not sure or maybe there's

5753.28 --> 5757.84
just no

5753.84 --> 5757.84
others around

5768.159 --> 5774.0
right okay you know what

5771.44 --> 5775.599999999999
screw it i'm gonna unban him because i

5774.0 --> 5777.52
don't want to look up his freaking name

5775.6 --> 5782.4800000000005
for half an hour in the band list

5777.52 --> 5782.4800000000005
that's freaking annoying but

5783.44 --> 5790.239
yeah it's better if he just stays away

5788.0 --> 5792.159
for a while

5790.239 --> 5794.879999999999
and hey if he comes back and does it

5792.159 --> 5798.159
again or worse then he will

5794.88 --> 5799.36
get banned let's just say i don't want

5798.159 --> 5802.719
him to speak up

5799.36 --> 5805.04
now this show anymore

5802.719 --> 5806.56
i wish there was like a time-based

5805.04 --> 5809.119
banning system

5806.56 --> 5812.400000000001
not just timeout but just like okay

5809.119 --> 5814.48
until the end of stream

5812.4 --> 5815.839999999999
wouldn't that be a good idea youtube

5814.48 --> 5819.119
just another type of

5815.84 --> 5819.119000000001
uh of timeout

5822.88 --> 5827.84
anyway i think i'm gonna round out the

5824.96 --> 5827.84
show

5830.0 --> 5835.52
although maybe i could talk a little bit

5832.719 --> 5835.52
more i'm not sure

5836.56 --> 5841.6
yeah that's right mark color just a

5839.52 --> 5844.080000000001
short time out and then it's just like

5841.6 --> 5847.6
over like yeah you're no longer allowed

5844.08 --> 5850.639
to speak during this live stream

5847.6 --> 5855.84
and yeah and of course an actual band

5850.639 --> 5855.84
should still be in there

5865.36 --> 5869.839999999999
like nathan does on his channel

5873.119 --> 5876.5599999999995
you mean in discord

5878.239 --> 5883.28
because nathan leaves his chat

5880.0 --> 5886.0
completely unmanaged

5883.28 --> 5886.4
or almost completely unless he is active

5886.0 --> 5889.44
in it

5886.4 --> 5889.44
during premieres

5895.6 --> 5899.6
you really warmly welcome back yeah but

5898.0 --> 5901.84
that's

5899.6 --> 5903.76
more colored that's funny that you bring

5901.84 --> 5907.52
that up

5903.76 --> 5909.360000000001
because he says that but it's been kind

5907.52 --> 5912.4800000000005
of a long time since that

5909.36 --> 5913.759999999999
actually made some real sense because he

5912.48 --> 5915.839999999999
has all kinds of

5913.76 --> 5917.52
policies and just sometimes he's like no

5915.84 --> 5918.639
i just don't want to talk to you ever

5917.52 --> 5921.92
again

5918.639 --> 5923.4400000000005
you know so but he says that in his

5921.92 --> 5925.6
routine he's been saying that

5923.44 --> 5927.44
like since the way back beginning of

5925.6 --> 5930.719
flat earth debate

5927.44 --> 5933.919999999999
and he did that back then but now

5930.719 --> 5936.8
yeah he still says it in the routine

5933.92 --> 5938.719
but it technically doesn't really

5936.8 --> 5940.4800000000005
exactly work like that anymore he does

5938.719 --> 5942.56
it just much more out of hand he

5940.48 --> 5945.44
just he's just king he makes his own

5942.56 --> 5949.1990000000005
rules and does it pretty okay

5945.44 --> 5953.119
so that's how nathan does it now

5949.199 --> 5967.839999999999
but yes like he says not like he does

5953.119 --> 5967.839999999999
the concept of having a timeout version

5975.84 --> 5981.84
okay that was my dad

5990.56 --> 5994.080000000001
all right anyway yeah that's a little

5992.159 --> 5995.599999999999
bit i am sorry sorry

5994.08 --> 5998.159
amanda but i am going to round out the

5995.6 --> 6000.639
show i kind of actually needed to take

5998.159 --> 6000.638999999999
that call

6002.88 --> 6009.84
so yeah been interesting show

6007.04 --> 6009.84
with lots of details

6010.48 --> 6016.638999999999
nice nice new idea or a progress idea

6013.84 --> 6020.2390000000005
for the sun manifestation withdrawing

6016.639 --> 6023.36
even uh

6020.239 --> 6024.4
