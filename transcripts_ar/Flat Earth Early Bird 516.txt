be much appreciated I'm working on it

67.17 --> 74.28
it's yeah YouTube is kind of taken away

71.46 --> 77.63999999999999
the old classic interfaces to now

74.28 --> 80.91
completely and I really don't like the

77.64 --> 83.31
new one because it just I get lost it's

80.91 --> 86.7
not organized very efficiently in my

83.31 --> 89.429
opinion yeah so I'm having a bit of

86.7 --> 92.91
trouble with all that but working on it

89.429 --> 97.17
and I'm just going with a pretty basic

92.91 --> 99.84
setting first and then see if I can head

97.17 --> 102.24000000000001
in the yeah whatever benefit you're

99.84 --> 104.19
gonna get later because I'm still very

102.24 --> 109.14
mixed it I don't have a really good plan

104.19 --> 112.53
concerning this and I don't want to get

109.14 --> 114.39
goofy and just blurt out ideas that I

112.53 --> 116.7
then said that are gonna cause trouble

114.39 --> 118.259
for me that arm that might ruin the

116.7 --> 122.3
balance of the show if you know what I

118.259 --> 128.119
mean this is like kind of what Jose

122.3 --> 132.35999999999999
situation but anyway yeah morning

128.119 --> 136.62
weather today is quite beautiful kind of

132.36 --> 141.52
same as yesterday slightly less windy

136.62 --> 144.09
maybe it's been great

141.52 --> 146.32000000000002
I went out from for some groceries and

144.09 --> 153.1
it's just nice and warm

146.32 --> 156.37
the wind is warm as well so like this

153.1 --> 161.70999999999998
today how this is that's typically a

156.37 --> 166.27
really good summer day this is like good

161.71 --> 166.98000000000002
weather in June that's kind of what it's

166.27 --> 171.43
like

166.98 --> 174.54999999999998
compared to my memories of summers so

171.43 --> 178.74
pretty beautiful anyway yeah I got

174.55 --> 181.57000000000002
tumeric coffee with me and green tea

178.74 --> 185.08
that's it now lemonade

181.57 --> 187.59
today was thinking of it didn't get to

185.08 --> 187.59
it in time

190.44 --> 193.52
[Music]

194.23 --> 203.83999999999997
yeah I had a very late night yesterday

199.0 --> 207.65
watching a lot of Star Trek and just

203.84 --> 209.989
looking all over the place trying to get

207.65 --> 214.79
a feel of where everything's going and I

209.989 --> 220.01
have to say maybe me in this moment but

214.79 --> 230.03
I just I don't really like it it's like

220.01 --> 237.709
everything is so tense and yeah I'm

230.03 --> 243.019
trying to say emulate it and see like

237.709 --> 245.239
where is this all going and it just I

243.019 --> 248.48000000000002
got a bad feeling about this in a way

245.239 --> 251.92000000000002
it's well everybody has you know but

248.48 --> 251.92
it's just that

257.2 --> 261.3
I almost got a sensation like

265.699 --> 271.32
it's so complex to put down I'm just

268.669 --> 273.68
starting out stumbling with this maybe I

271.32 --> 277.68
should go through chat first

273.68 --> 282.99
let it sink in for a bit anyway Amanda

277.68 --> 286.47
um was first I think like energy our boy

282.99 --> 297.86
our body stuff steel kamikaze Gilmore

286.47 --> 297.86

309.229 --> 317.31899999999996
pillson pop bolts gun creation bear

317.77 --> 326.409
John John Mac yeah good to see you all

322.96 --> 326.409
to see

330.16 --> 338.03000000000003
and yeah I'm a bit tense I haven't had

334.52 --> 341.41999999999996
any serious outbursts but it's still

338.03 --> 343.13
there's just tension and everything I

341.42 --> 353.39000000000004
click on everything that I take a look

343.13 --> 357.68
and is just reflecting this it just

353.39 --> 364.07
feels metaphysically like there's energy

357.68 --> 367.91
clamp and in a way I think I've had some

364.07 --> 370.3
of that for a long time it's it's so

367.91 --> 374.57000000000005
hard to explain it's just this feeling

370.3 --> 377.68
but it's happening worldwide in a way

374.57 --> 377.68
and it's just

385.06 --> 392.84
how do you explain this right so

389.78 --> 396.04999999999995
normally being somewhat clamped down

392.84 --> 402.43899999999996
give gave me a lot of room in my spirit

396.05 --> 405.71000000000004
to still get out there right to just

402.439 --> 408.05
ponder upon other things and to put my

405.71 --> 410.68899999999996
hope in things and all that but now

408.05 --> 413.0
suddenly that like everything that I try

410.689 --> 414.62
to tune into is just under this tension

413.0 --> 418.659
so I can escape from this tension

414.62 --> 418.659
effectively is it's really frustrating

430.43 --> 436.91
and well what did what I conclude from

433.55 --> 441.62
it is that yeah there's it's almost like

436.91 --> 444.26000000000005
it's I feel like as it metaphorically as

441.62 --> 448.43
a tree I'm certainly somebody put like

444.26 --> 450.17
artificial stuff in the ground - kind of

448.43 --> 455.09000000000003
like forced me to grow even though

450.17 --> 457.88
that's not really efficient this is all

455.09 --> 460.96999999999997
spiritual it it's so weird to even try

457.88 --> 463.52
to explain this but I feel like this

460.97 --> 466.43
clan that is trying to force me to find

463.52 --> 474.34999999999997
a way through but that's not how it's

466.43 --> 476.36
supposed to you know it's like there's

474.35 --> 479.03000000000003
something in me that that's like trying

476.36 --> 483.08000000000004
to resist because I feel like I am being

479.03 --> 485.59999999999997
controlled and or where it seems to come

483.08 --> 491.71
from this control is it's not something

485.6 --> 491.71000000000004
that I like to be controlled by you know

499.99 --> 507.25
because I know it's just like the idea

504.67 --> 509.44
of just being steered and being taught a

507.25 --> 512.23
lesson by the creator and by creation

509.44 --> 516.58
itself you know that's one thing but

512.23 --> 522.76
when it just seems like you're being

516.58 --> 527.5300000000001
forced to play a hand by a specific you

522.76 --> 530.8
know that's yeah you could just try to

527.53 --> 535.39
ignore it and then proceed but it just

530.8 --> 537.6099999999999
feels wrong it I don't know that's just

535.39 --> 543.79
this visceral resistance that I am

537.61 --> 545.5
experienced it's so visceral right like

543.79 --> 552.04
is this really what it's come down to

545.5 --> 555.13
that the system has just figured out if

552.04 --> 558.64
we just over push and continue to build

555.13 --> 561.75
more layers of nonsense more pushy

558.64 --> 565.0
people will just be swept away by it

561.75 --> 567.31
because they can't get enough breathing

565.0 --> 570.94
room and almost literally now with the

567.31 --> 573.6899999999999
stupid mask to get a momentum to try and

570.94 --> 580.09
alter anything about it anymore

573.69 --> 582.8800000000001
like as a matter of perspective you know

580.09 --> 584.89
we think that we've been awakening a lot

582.88 --> 586.63
and technically we have we've all

584.89 --> 588.67
learned so much the ones that have

586.63 --> 595.56
actually allowed themselves to do that

588.67 --> 598.75
that could go there but now the system

595.56 --> 602.2299999999999
seems to have almost the same kind of

598.75 --> 604.99
momentum almost ironically like yeah we

602.23 --> 609.6700000000001
didn't think they could do it but it's

604.99 --> 614.35
they're just doing it and for all our

609.67 --> 618.64
confidence we're kind of like now

614.35 --> 625.0
confronted with the grim reality of how

618.64 --> 628.27
easily people are dissuaded and let it

625.0 --> 631.11
go getting distracted severely how

628.27 --> 636.06
easily people can get severely destroy

631.11 --> 638.07
that it's it really requires dedication

636.06 --> 639.89
to stay focused on principles and it

638.07 --> 644.49
seems like most people have just

639.89 --> 648.56
deprioritized that concept over the go

644.49 --> 650.73
along to get along system and they lost

648.56 --> 652.9699999999999
oversight because that's the problem

650.73 --> 656.4590000000001
when you do that too many that you lose

652.97 --> 658.529
you surrender your control and you lose

656.459 --> 663.0
the oversight of how to deal with that

658.529 --> 667.1
and in ways I've developed my own

663.0 --> 672.62
problems because of this because my

667.1 --> 677.57
working life as it were I let that slip

672.62 --> 680.25
in my teens so badly I resisted too much

677.57 --> 682.32
from the inside also because I already

680.25 --> 685.47
saw that there's so much wrong with it

682.32 --> 688.85
with what's actually out there like it's

685.47 --> 691.529
not really honest work anymore it's

688.85 --> 695.19
parts of it are but at the same time

691.529 --> 696.99
there's like these other things you're

695.19 --> 701.1600000000001
you're getting dragged into you your

696.99 --> 703.74
behavior is going to be modified you're

701.16 --> 706.5
going to be manipulated to get involved

703.74 --> 708.87
in things it's just that always now

706.5 --> 709.82
happens here it has been all my life

708.87 --> 714.48
pretty much

709.82 --> 716.1600000000001
it's very this has been very painful and

714.48 --> 719.01
this has made me choose to kind of

716.16 --> 720.93
disconnect from engaging in that even

719.01 --> 724.14
though everybody always said no you got

720.93 --> 726.12
to keep on going because otherwise she

724.14 --> 727.98
will not be selfish you be in financial

726.12 --> 730.47
trouble like everybody warned me about

727.98 --> 733.64
this but it just couldn't do it I just

730.47 --> 733.64
couldn't do it I

741.769 --> 748.119
and now it feels sometimes like I'm

744.23 --> 751.91
being seduced like no no do it anyway

748.119 --> 754.009
you're stronger now right you can handle

751.91 --> 758.689
those things right can I do

754.009 --> 763.42
is it not just the same as if I would

758.689 --> 766.309
have done that so many years ago except

763.42 --> 770.809
with more knowledge about what I'm doing

766.309 --> 777.499
is wrong when then it was just a strong

770.809 --> 779.689
visceral feeling it's I'm really in a

777.499 --> 782.809
complex situation concerning that but at

779.689 --> 786.17
the same time I got you guys I've got my

782.809 --> 790.069
project here I sometimes feel like it's

786.17 --> 793.16
completely useless if you don't take

790.069 --> 797.8689999999999
that personal it's like it seems like

793.16 --> 800.439
I'm doing so little in the face of

797.869 --> 803.48
everything that's transpired and then

800.439 --> 806.329
now drawing back to comparison as to

803.48 --> 813.1700000000001
where I started it's just we are all

806.329 --> 816.17
being so preoccupied and like at some

813.17 --> 822.4989999999999
point when we try to get enough momentum

816.17 --> 827.7199999999999
we are forced on a railroad like it the

822.499 --> 830.72
system it's it presents a real Road that

827.72 --> 833.99
is often actually quite good to take it

830.72 --> 836.799
seems from the short-run but you become

833.99 --> 838.699
part of that and then the system almost

836.799 --> 842.569
inter-dimensionally starts to rearrange

838.699 --> 848.779
everything around that thing that you're

842.569 --> 851.7199999999999
engaging in it's mind-blowing and so we

848.779 --> 853.999
are then automatically set in a position

851.72 --> 856.119
where we are going to be preoccupied

853.999 --> 859.519
with certain things in order for us to

856.119 --> 864.5590000000001
not engage in a way that could really

859.519 --> 866.48
alter things physically more it's like

864.559 --> 871.3689999999999
there seems so much to do so much to

866.48 --> 874.369
learn even on YouTube for me that

871.369 --> 877.7900000000001
effectively it is still preventing me

874.369 --> 882.799
from physically doing more and like

877.79 --> 889.1189999999999
taking more risks to meet people but

882.799 --> 893.36
yeah I don't know man at the same time I

889.119 --> 895.8190000000001
am getting kind of good at doing this so

893.36 --> 899.749
yeah then the option is present - do I

895.819 --> 901.49
like completely somehow turn around my

899.749 --> 903.86
life do I think that is possible because

901.49 --> 910.819
I have tried those to do those things

903.86 --> 914.029
and unfortunately I crashed pretty much

910.819 --> 915.919
every time I tried that I would get

914.029 --> 918.649
something out of doing it I would get

915.919 --> 921.289
some experience on people but I would

918.649 --> 924.35
always like sudden change around is

921.289 --> 928.009
always been bad for me and again that

924.35 --> 930.86
this is why I'm being so forward about

928.009 --> 932.869
hey I'm a slow grower this is how I work

930.86 --> 937.5790000000001
I keep my balance this is how I work I

932.869 --> 941.929
don't like being a slow grower because

937.579 --> 945.019
at the same time I have very strong

941.929 --> 948.319
impulses to be impatient I have to

945.019 --> 950.089
constantly keep that in its place to

948.319 --> 953.439
allow the slow growth that is more

950.089 --> 962.0290000000001
efficient it is super frustrating really

953.439 --> 965.7489999999999
well but I gotta keep going and it is

962.029 --> 969.289
kind of worth it still if I look at it

965.749 --> 972.379
honestly because I got you guys and

969.289 --> 975.199
you've all supported me like on a daily

972.379 --> 977.9590000000001
basis now and it's like I I really do

975.199 --> 979.9989999999999
need it because there's more trouble on

977.959 --> 985.7299999999999
the horizon there's always more it's

979.999 --> 987.41
never over it's always more I don't even

985.73 --> 989.689
want to get into it it's just more about

987.41 --> 991.999
my storage with my stuff you know it's

989.689 --> 999.03
I've been confronted with like yeah

991.999 --> 1005.27
throw away everything you have for

999.03 --> 1009.05
for like six years now like constantly

1005.27 --> 1012.21
being told one way or another like yeah

1009.05 --> 1015.18
either you're gonna crash or you're

1012.21 --> 1018.09
gonna be forced to sacrifice things from

1015.18 --> 1021.8399999999999
your past that you would just want to

1018.09 --> 1027.57
give a place and you can't it's

1021.84 --> 1031.14
monstrous because I am kind of a it's

1027.57 --> 1033.99
it's a bad trade I guess but I am clingy

1031.14 --> 1036.99
to physical things I used to be much

1033.99 --> 1039.69
worse at it like my mother had it even

1036.99 --> 1042.45
worse like it's like a hoarder it can

1039.69 --> 1044.6100000000001
become hoarding if you completely obsess

1042.45 --> 1047.01
over it and becomes like really you

1044.61 --> 1050.1899999999998
become in love with that [ __ ] with just

1047.01 --> 1052.86
stuff being stuff and you don't want it

1050.19 --> 1055.14
to go it's crazy I know but I've never

1052.86 --> 1059.25
had it that bad thank God but it's

1055.14 --> 1062.7
always been like I do attach a lot of

1059.25 --> 1067.47
things like I do always feel sad when I

1062.7 --> 1069.45
have to throw something away because I

1067.47 --> 1071.67
then realized like yeah this is a thing

1069.45 --> 1075.26
that was built and then it did stuff and

1071.67 --> 1079.38
it helped me potentially or I don't know

1075.26 --> 1082.3799999999999
even like it being just in the way is

1079.38 --> 1084.1200000000001
almost like a very superficial personal

1082.38 --> 1086.13
relationship because yeah a lot of

1084.12 --> 1087.75
people they don't really mean anything

1086.13 --> 1089.67
they can just be in the way but you

1087.75 --> 1092.42
still develop that connection just a

1089.67 --> 1095.01
basic connection and I have that weird

1092.42 --> 1099.6000000000001
effect with objects and plants and

1095.01 --> 1102.51
everything but I don't let it get to me

1099.6 --> 1104.6599999999999
just like I try not to let people get to

1102.51 --> 1104.66
me

1110.36 --> 1126.7099999999998
I don't even know where I was trying to

1116.6 --> 1129.1999999999998
go with my point right yeah I did get a

1126.71 --> 1134.57
super chat or I mean a PayPal donation

1129.2 --> 1138.5900000000001
from person that I don't exciting kits a

1134.57 --> 1141.59
new one can only guess at the name but

1138.59 --> 1143.3799999999999
anyway like 21 euros that was yesterday

1141.59 --> 1146.09
evening so thank you so much

1143.38 --> 1150.74
whoever you are if you're in my chat

1146.09 --> 1160.9099999999999
then identify yourself if you want you

1150.74 --> 1163.67
don't have to thank you so much yeah so

1160.91 --> 1167.0600000000002
that's good and I need it because there

1163.67 --> 1170.27
might be a situation that yep here's the

1167.06 --> 1174.11
story it more more relation to

1170.27 --> 1177.08
everything okay yeah my parents business

1174.11 --> 1179.6599999999999
my dad and my stepmothers businesses

1177.08 --> 1182.57
have effectively been shut down because

1179.66 --> 1189.89
of Corona like they've been ordered and

1182.57 --> 1195.77
they will get giant finds its and their

1189.89 --> 1199.64
strategy is to wait it out and because

1195.77 --> 1204.4
of that my dad is getting in financial

1199.64 --> 1206.8700000000001
trouble and so he's basically shoving

1204.4 --> 1209.63
some of the issues that he helped me out

1206.87 --> 1213.6799999999998
with back to me and that concerns my

1209.63 --> 1220.5100000000002
storage stuff so you can see how the

1213.68 --> 1220.51
situation has kind of yeah got to me

1220.95 --> 1227.52
really sick of the corona [ __ ] and

1225.18 --> 1230.5800000000002
also I had a conversation with somebody

1227.52 --> 1234.45
yesterday from the building that I kind

1230.58 --> 1236.9099999999999
of know and they were completely corona

1234.45 --> 1239.16
and doctrine aidid and when I really

1236.91 --> 1245.1000000000001
calmly tried to tell them like no no

1239.16 --> 1248.0400000000002
that the government is lying it's all

1245.1 --> 1251.4599999999998
nonsense like what they say about it is

1248.04 --> 1255.48
nonsense it's didn't it's not what that

1251.46 --> 1257.88
is it's probably everyone in the world

1255.48 --> 1260.04
has already contracted it and most don't

1257.88 --> 1263.3100000000002
even know and then some may get it and

1260.04 --> 1267.12
they may get it again it all these

1263.31 --> 1270.3
measures are completely superfluous it's

1267.12 --> 1272.6399999999999
like even if you presuppose like what it

1270.3 --> 1275.01
probably is and was and how and all that

1272.64 --> 1278.96
if from a more real perspective than

1275.01 --> 1282.6
everything they do is completely useless

1278.96 --> 1285.3600000000001
hundred-percent there is no possible way

1282.6 --> 1290.52
from any perspective that what is being

1285.36 --> 1295.83
done here will be any kind of useful

1290.52 --> 1298.8
anyway medically it's all useless all

1295.83 --> 1301.9199999999998
these measures it's only a waste of

1298.8 --> 1303.99
money it's the only thing it is and yeah

1301.92 --> 1306.8400000000001
the shutting down especially it's it's

1303.99 --> 1308.55
just an assault and that's why I've said

1306.84 --> 1312.72
earlier it sounds really bold but this

1308.55 --> 1317.24
is like a government assault on the

1312.72 --> 1317.24
public on a worldwide scale

1322.91 --> 1329.69
that's the only real effect that is

1326.42 --> 1332.15
transpiring the rest is nonsense well I

1329.69 --> 1334.16
didn't go that far with telling the lady

1332.15 --> 1336.68
in the building but even when I just

1334.16 --> 1339.2900000000002
said like they're liars and she was like

1336.68 --> 1343.13
but are you gonna listen to the speech

1339.29 --> 1347.0
from our president 7 o'clock it's

1343.13 --> 1348.0200000000002
important and like no I already know

1347.0 --> 1351.14
what he's gonna say

1348.02 --> 1353.45
I don't I don't even have to look into

1351.14 --> 1358.0
what he has been saying because I know

1353.45 --> 1361.6100000000001
exactly what it's gonna be because it is

1358.0 --> 1364.22
monolithic that whole thing it's

1361.61 --> 1369.11
monolithic it's one direction it's one

1364.22 --> 1372.26
system it's one puzzle being laid out

1369.11 --> 1375.5
piece by piece and most people already

1372.26 --> 1379.1
know exactly what its gonna be and it is

1375.5 --> 1383.95
gonna be that so I don't need to see

1379.1 --> 1387.77
that to know what its gonna be like and

1383.95 --> 1391.91
she was pissed off she like she was like

1387.77 --> 1394.79
really getting angry but she held it

1391.91 --> 1397.91
back because I already said like yeah I

1394.79 --> 1400.1299999999999
have studied medical things she has

1397.91 --> 1402.77
listened we've talked in the past you

1400.13 --> 1405.67
know and I've been very open and honest

1402.77 --> 1409.99
and respectful like because she is a

1405.67 --> 1409.99
typical type of person that is very

1411.88 --> 1421.7
good-hearted cognitively not very

1415.91 --> 1424.16
superior but still has good senses but

1421.7 --> 1426.38
yeah because she's so good hearted has

1424.16 --> 1428.42
good sense as less intellect they are

1426.38 --> 1430.64
more easy it's much more trouble to them

1428.42 --> 1435.47
to figure out how to trust it's much

1430.64 --> 1438.65
more of a challenge and but she has seen

1435.47 --> 1441.2
from me I feel like given her insights

1438.65 --> 1444.8000000000002
that she'd never attained before in a

1441.2 --> 1446.63
good way and so she recognized like wow

1444.8 --> 1449.69
even though she had like this hostile

1446.63 --> 1453.68
response that like I shouldn't do that

1449.69 --> 1456.64
because because of what yeah because of

1453.68 --> 1462.3500000000001
who I'm talking to and that was

1456.64 --> 1464.3300000000002
that was a relief because I don't want

1462.35 --> 1466.1899999999998
her to now obsess over me being some

1464.33 --> 1469.1899999999998
kind of virtual danger in relation to

1466.19 --> 1471.6200000000001
Corona because I have this dance I mean

1469.19 --> 1473.809
absolutely well but I was very clear to

1471.62 --> 1478.549
her not like I'm very confident that

1473.809 --> 1482.09
everyone has had this everyone like the

1478.549 --> 1484.22
infectious rate how it could if that is

1482.09 --> 1488.36
a thing it's good instantly it's

1484.22 --> 1489.89
everywhere it's just and everybody you

1488.36 --> 1492.53
get it and nobody will even notice

1489.89 --> 1498.169
really it would be like okay I had a

1492.53 --> 1502.94
less than severe flu I had a I had a flu

1498.169 --> 1505.46
in in December remember after the

1502.94 --> 1507.5
Amsterdam conference was pretty bad even

1505.46 --> 1512.6200000000001
it's also because I was stressed out you

1507.5 --> 1519.25
know and so I think that was probably it

1512.62 --> 1519.25
that was the thing I think

1523.0 --> 1536.91
I didn't know yeah so yeah lots of stuff

1533.2 --> 1539.89
is happening around me and everybody

1536.91 --> 1544.6000000000001
everybody all the regulars are all

1539.89 --> 1546.67
getting drowned in this in this hype and

1544.6 --> 1548.56
this fear and this warning that they can

1546.67 --> 1551.02
get away from yet they're not getting

1548.56 --> 1556.33
the with the fear they're not getting

1551.02 --> 1559.24
tools they're not they're just being

1556.33 --> 1560.9499999999998
panic and it's so hard to get away from

1559.24 --> 1563.38
because that panic is through people

1560.95 --> 1566.8
echoing on because of their bad habit of

1563.38 --> 1569.5300000000002
like oh there's a pentagon let's let's

1566.8 --> 1577.12
relay that panic everybody's doing that

1569.53 --> 1579.28
oh hey thank you a TV for the 50 Denmark

1577.12 --> 1582.6899999999998
Crona is it right

1579.28 --> 1587.55
buy yourself a doughnut okay

1582.69 --> 1591.49
well something like that

1587.55 --> 1595.1499999999999
they don't really have doughnuts organic

1591.49 --> 1599.08
ones my favorite I don't like sugary

1595.15 --> 1605.26
bread but thanks I

1599.08 --> 1607.56
I'll see what I get with that hmm thanks

1605.26 --> 1612.99
for the superjet donation a levy or

1607.56 --> 1612.99
whatever Oh yep appreciate it

1616.32 --> 1622.48
Illuminati crass ah ah well bill gee I

1619.24 --> 1625.24
would love that but unfortunately they

1622.48 --> 1631.96
don't make them anymore because of

1625.24 --> 1634.39
Kuroda yay yeah no more they only have

1631.96 --> 1637.9
them like a cold prepackaged and guess

1634.39 --> 1639.67
what another bonus the oven is broken so

1637.9 --> 1646.02
I can't get those and then heat them up

1639.67 --> 1646.02
myself so yeah special combi whoo-hoo

1646.92 --> 1656.0500000000002
it's great how things come together

1649.51 --> 1659.02
doesn't it it's a pretty crazy situation

1656.05 --> 1663.28
now like things are breaking down around

1659.02 --> 1665.8799999999999
here although my computer's still doing

1663.28 --> 1668.8
fine thank you computer

1665.88 --> 1672.45
so glad you know this this computer is

1668.8 --> 1675.61
just amazing how long it's lasted and

1672.45 --> 1678.55
I'm still so satisfied I have just it

1675.61 --> 1680.62
was the best combination that I figured

1678.55 --> 1685.09
out with my knowledge of my entire life

1680.62 --> 1687.6299999999999
of pcs and I built it and it's perfect I

1685.09 --> 1690.8799999999999
love this freaking computer it's

1687.63 --> 1693.7
completely noiseless it never overheats

1690.88 --> 1696.16
is like even if the direct Summer Sun is

1693.7 --> 1699.22
right on top of it maybe because it's

1696.16 --> 1703.63
all black right it doesn't overheat

1699.22 --> 1706.63
it's just perfect and hasn't really

1703.63 --> 1709.8400000000001
broken down like at all and I'm very

1706.63 --> 1712.92
careful with managing it so yay see I

1709.84 --> 1715.6299999999999
can still find something that's just

1712.92 --> 1719.38
great anyway

1715.63 --> 1723.4
and you guys are great thank you for old

1719.38 --> 1730.8000000000002
sport so uh anyone up for some flat

earth it's been more baller activity oh

1731.16 --> 1738.3700000000001
yeah I went on Jose's again a little I

1734.17 --> 1742.15
think did I no way I went in chat that's

1738.37 --> 1745.75
right I didn't go on the show I think or

1742.15 --> 1748.88
did I I didn't know man it just

1745.75 --> 1754.4
recent week has been kind of a blur I'm

1748.88 --> 1760.72
so much on so many flattered discord and

1754.4 --> 1762.98
Jose's and and watching streams that

1760.72 --> 1767.6000000000001
sometimes it's just hard to keep track

1762.98 --> 1769.46
anymore I don't remember seeing any Owen

1767.6 --> 1772.4299999999998
Benjamin streams yesterday I don't know

1769.46 --> 1780.38
what's going on that's something that I

1772.43 --> 1784.5800000000002
did miss oh yeah rumpus you merely added

1780.38 --> 1794.5400000000002
himself against oh man t okay I miss

1784.58 --> 1796.37
that well I don't watch it anymore do I

1794.54 --> 1806.3
want to come on the show next week sure

1796.37 --> 1811.61
good service why not you know in a way

1806.3 --> 1813.32
surprisingly I've realized that I kind

1811.61 --> 1820.61
of need to put this out there as well is

1813.32 --> 1825.59
that before like before before before I

1820.61 --> 1828.1899999999998
went on YouTube right I was a lot doing

1825.59 --> 1830.78
stuff on internet and commenting

1828.19 --> 1831.98
articles especially news articles always

1830.78 --> 1836.12
trying to get involved with news

1831.98 --> 1838.55
articles before yeah before the clap

1836.12 --> 1841.0
down went bad and they only allow

1838.55 --> 1844.19
specific Sal Vanya is to comment and

1841.0 --> 1848.29
it's so messed up the comment sections

1844.19 --> 1850.16
now and even alternative news it's crazy

1848.29 --> 1857.12
what's going on out there

1850.16 --> 1858.8600000000001
ooh but yeah that that's all gone like I

1857.12 --> 1859.82
don't really go there anymore I'm now I

1858.86 --> 1862.8799999999999
lost track of it

1859.82 --> 1864.77
you distracted me Guns of Navarone thank

1862.88 --> 1866.72
you for the 50 Canadian dollar super

1864.77 --> 1869.21
detonation I like your rationale peace

1866.72 --> 1871.99
and love to you thank you so much but

1869.21 --> 1881.559
now I lost track of what it was safe

1871.99 --> 1883.84
the comment sections and I right before

1881.559 --> 1886.27
I went on YouTube right now I know my

1883.84 --> 1887.79
point again now I know it Thanks

1886.27 --> 1891.34
[Music]

1887.79 --> 1895.0
before I spent a lot of time on the

1891.34 --> 1897.57
internet and on my computer and from a

1895.0 --> 1902.35
personal perspective at that time

1897.57 --> 1905.8899999999999
unfortunately I used it as an escapism I

1902.35 --> 1908.25
used it to evade responsibility I did it

1905.89 --> 1911.26
even during my relationship with my ex

1908.25 --> 1913.24
although I tried to cut down on too

1911.26 --> 1916.679
because I did learn so much there was so

1913.24 --> 1920.22
much that we could talk about and

1916.679 --> 1923.95
medical interest especially because yeah

1920.22 --> 1927.179
that time but I used it to effectively

1923.95 --> 1929.47
to escape engaging in jobs and all that

1927.179 --> 1932.98
maybe that seemed a little bit more

1929.47 --> 1936.01
viable back then sort of until I just

1932.98 --> 1937.33
lost spirit and then yet the done that

1936.01 --> 1943.54
doesn't work anymore I don't have the

1937.33 --> 1945.61
spirit to really engage so now I've just

1943.54 --> 1947.47
realized that I was always kind of

1945.61 --> 1949.9599999999998
afraid like oh my god if I'm gonna do

1947.47 --> 1953.2
this I'm gonna get on YouTube and just

1949.96 --> 1957.82
literally ten days an hour or something

1953.2 --> 1960.07
be doing this [ __ ] you know that's gonna

1957.82 --> 1962.53
kill me I really thought that I thought

1960.07 --> 1966.07
if I got if I'm gonna do that it's gonna

1962.53 --> 1968.53
be like in the past but worse I'm gonna

1966.07 --> 1970.3899999999999
spend so much energy not getting

1968.53 --> 1971.25
anything out of it and it's gonna kill

1970.39 --> 1976.179
me

1971.25 --> 1980.11
but now that it's know now that I have a

1976.179 --> 1981.6100000000001
youtube show it's it's hot because with

1980.11 --> 1984.76
all the support that I'm getting and

1981.61 --> 1988.7199999999998
with all the flaws that I showed like me

1984.76 --> 1991.87
being kind of slow in my developments in

1988.72 --> 1995.58
like the upgrade of all the things that

1991.87 --> 2000.059
I do on YouTube and all that my skills

1995.58 --> 2002.1
that I'm kind of slow at it that despite

2000.059 --> 2006.059
that I'm getting quite a lot of support

2002.1 --> 2010.58
I guess for my persistence that is the

2006.059 --> 2012.83
persistence is almost strengthened by my

2010.58 --> 2014.96
lack of

2012.83 --> 2016.73
continual development it's it's

2014.96 --> 2019.97
interesting how that kind of worked out

2016.73 --> 2024.2
and I got because of the support it's

2019.97 --> 2026.779
changed because I realize now that by

2024.2 --> 2030.559
doing this I am getting income I am

2026.779 --> 2033.83
building more momentum and now I have

2030.559 --> 2036.73
the energy to do that and not to feel

2033.83 --> 2041.3899999999999
bad about it because I know that I'm

2036.73 --> 2045.019
going somewhere also financially it's

2041.39 --> 2047.72
such an odd realization that yes I am on

2045.019 --> 2050.54
the computer I am basically effectively

2047.72 --> 2057.109
staring my time away but I am paying

2050.54 --> 2061.0099999999998
attention I am learning and whoa and it

2057.109 --> 2064.929
doesn't drain me so much when I did do

2061.01 --> 2069.71
these things escapist wise it drained me

2064.929 --> 2072.889
because I was not progressing I was not

2069.71 --> 2075.889
building towards anything that I would

2072.889 --> 2078.1690000000003
be able to make money out of really it

2075.889 --> 2081.02
was only taking me away from the plans

2078.169 --> 2086.81
in which I could be making money but now

2081.02 --> 2089.54
it's different it's and it's so bizarre

2086.81 --> 2096.23
and fascinating how just the Energy's

2089.54 --> 2100.339
completely change even though I'm

2096.23 --> 2102.56
effectively doing the same things the

2100.339 --> 2106.07
way the energy manifests to me is

2102.56 --> 2109.46
different now because I am there is a

2106.07 --> 2111.44
purpose to it and like it's I feel I

2109.46 --> 2113.63
really am going somewhere anyway thank

2111.44 --> 2116.15
you again Guns of Navarone rmp for the

2113.63 --> 2117.8900000000003
fifty another fifty Canadian dollar

2116.15 --> 2119.96
superjet donation sorry I meant to send

2117.89 --> 2124.3689999999997
one hundred in one shot that's it's

2119.96 --> 2131.26
perfectly fine thank you man oh wow look

2124.369 --> 2131.26
who's in chat Shan ji right

2133.71 --> 2138.8
is this one way of saying it you know

2139.19 --> 2149.1
but yeah your laziness is it's like a

2145.8 --> 2150.9300000000003
curse you know but if you're at least

2149.1 --> 2154.56
going somewhere if you're at least

2150.93 --> 2157.0499999999997
developing with despite your

2154.56 --> 2158.7599999999998
unwillingness to engage in certain

2157.05 --> 2161.3
things because you don't like it which

2158.76 --> 2167.8100000000004
is really what laziness comes down to

2161.3 --> 2167.8100000000004
then is it really laziness or is it just

2168.38 --> 2174.3900000000003
stubbornness and you're trying to find

2170.7 --> 2183.06
another way somehow and seemingly not

2174.39 --> 2185.19
making any progress at first so but by

2183.06 --> 2187.23
but I understand what you try to do that

2185.19 --> 2190.38
with the capital letters lazy that's

2187.23 --> 2193.95
okay you know why because a lot of

2190.38 --> 2198.33
people have called me lazy I've admitted

2193.95 --> 2202.89
being lazy and I know it's not a good

2198.33 --> 2207.72
thing but I'm not that lazy really I've

2202.89 --> 2211.14
seen other people holy [ __ ] that are so

2207.72 --> 2220.5299999999997
that are too lazy to freaking have a

2211.14 --> 2223.02
mind okay now that's [ __ ] lazy sorry

2220.53 --> 2228.75
for the earthen bombs should cut down on

2223.02 --> 2234.63
this what do I do for a living

2228.75 --> 2238.77
I have a youtube show and I am a

2234.63 --> 2245.6600000000003
researcher I'm a speaker I'm a Cosmo

2238.77 --> 2254.79
Genest researcher specifically hobbyist

2245.66 --> 2257.94
layman physicist I deal in I'm basically

2254.79 --> 2261.63
my own doctor and I yeah I deal in in

2257.94 --> 2263.46
medical knowledge sorta yeah to some

2261.63 --> 2266.36
degree in certain regions especially

2263.46 --> 2270.12
nutritious

2266.36 --> 2272.13
and yeah I did I develop knowledge and

2270.12 --> 2275.66
they seek knowledge and I try to clear

2272.13 --> 2279.3900000000003
things up I have a function within

2275.66 --> 2281.67
within yeah communica Tori oh yeah we

2279.39 --> 2283.2599999999998
communication situations to get

2281.67 --> 2285.12
misunderstandings out of the way this is

2283.26 --> 2287.19
something I can do it's a unique skill

2285.12 --> 2290.85
other people can do it too a lot of

2287.19 --> 2296.64
leaders can do it I pride myself in

2290.85 --> 2299.22
being particularly good at it it's my

2296.64 --> 2301.5299999999997
thing it was even good at it

2299.22 --> 2304.2
when I have much less understanding a

2301.53 --> 2305.4300000000003
long time ago when it was little and

2304.2 --> 2308.73
then it seems rare it's like a

2305.43 --> 2310.1099999999997
miraculous skill that you can figure

2308.73 --> 2312.63
things out even though you don't

2310.11 --> 2316.6800000000003
understand that much you can just

2312.63 --> 2322.38
quickly learn to understand it on the

2316.68 --> 2326.8999999999996
spot it's amazing anyway I do all these

2322.38 --> 2326.9
things and yeah I have income from it I

2328.94 --> 2335.87
have a social group effectively and I

2332.91 --> 2338.19
keep track of everyone or well everybody

2335.87 --> 2339.9
enough people and other people keep

2338.19 --> 2342.78
track of other people and that that it's

2339.9 --> 2347.34
a social circle here on the internet all

2342.78 --> 2351.6600000000003
over the world I am also a paperboy oh

2347.34 --> 2354.78

news the local news this city and I'm

2358.59 --> 2362.7000000000003
it's funny because I'm actually now kind

2360.87 --> 2364.92
of proud about it you know what's even

2362.7 --> 2366.66
more hilarious so many people are

2364.92 --> 2370.8
talking about it like oh yeah

2366.66 --> 2373.47
paperboy that's doable we should do that

2370.8 --> 2376.0800000000004
and nobody does it because it doesn't

2373.47 --> 2379.02
make any money from it not really but

2376.08 --> 2382.68
I'm doing it and it's like ha yeah I was

2379.02 --> 2386.31
doing death he for years I've been yeah

2382.68 --> 2391.1699999999996

donation thank you for that I have no

2435.599 --> 2444.29
idea I I don't know

you know as far as I'm concerned there's

2452.31 --> 2457.14
a lot of weird issues but I also think

2455.13 --> 2460.05
that he's done that on purpose

2457.14 --> 2464.94
he's trying to create conspiracies about

2460.05 --> 2467.4300000000003
himself I tried to not do that and then

2464.94 --> 2472.79
other people proceeded to do that for me

2467.43 --> 2476.97
great but well to be fair I get

2472.79 --> 2481.65
conspiracy now yeah I don't okay yeah

2476.97 --> 2485.1899999999996
issues in my past okay but I don't like

2481.65 --> 2488.55
try to create controversy secret

2485.19 --> 2490.44
nonsense like right now you know I'm not

2488.55 --> 2491.9700000000003
a perfect person but I've been very

2490.44 --> 2493.4900000000002
straightforward with everything it's

2491.97 --> 2497.8489999999997
been my stick

2493.49 --> 2501.29
Randi however seems to be very amused

2497.849 --> 2507.119
when people get preoccupied with

2501.29 --> 2514.819
suspicions about him I think or at least

2507.119 --> 2514.819
that is what I suspect but I you know

2540.85 --> 2549.87
I don't know you yeah I already answered

2547.48 --> 2549.87
that question

2558.85 --> 2562.0299999999997
[Music]

2563.97 --> 2569.1699999999996

you too

2578.5 --> 2582.96
okay good to know good servant

2594.29 --> 2601.82
what's my favorite type of shoe well I

2599.21 --> 2605.75
don't know the type of shoe that I've

2601.82 --> 2608.6600000000003
always had or what at least since I was

2605.75 --> 2613.94
like 20 and it's this type of shoe I

2608.66 --> 2621.74
don't know it's still nose kind of boots

2613.94 --> 2629.96
this is what I like don't even know how

2621.74 --> 2633.08
to call them I guess it's like an army

2629.96 --> 2636.17
style boots but it's I don't know if

2633.08 --> 2638.359
it's like official but they're I really

2636.17 --> 2644.17
like these types of shoes I appreciate

2638.359 --> 2644.17
it and I'm kind of used to it so

2651.3 --> 2656.5800000000004
the only issue with the dough is that if

2653.49 --> 2659.2799999999997
it's very warm you can get very sweaty

2656.58 --> 2662.09
feet in them that's the only issue I

2659.28 --> 2662.09
have with them

2673.019 --> 2678.899

2688.619 --> 2695.339
something going so keep it up

Sean G's girlfriend using Sean G's

2780.769 --> 2788.769
account otherwise I think somebody just

2785.66 --> 2788.769
came out in the closet

2817.91 --> 2830.8289999999997
came out at the port yet now that's

2821.329 --> 2830.829
something else okay all right

2830.98 --> 2841.15
fine but you do realize there's gonna be

2837.829 --> 2845.1800000000003
certain type of consequences for that

2841.15 --> 2853.329
I'm not gonna ya nag you with it too

2845.18 --> 2853.3289999999997

[Music]

2894.329 --> 2903.73
yeah yeah look guys let me be clear

2900.67 --> 2906.73
about this I don't know this might put

2903.73 --> 2910.259
off some people but it needs to be said

2906.73 --> 2913.9900000000002
okay like I love Owen Benjamin's

2910.259 --> 2917.4
stick the jokes that he does with the

2913.99 --> 2925.39
dumpster pumping and all that [ __ ] but

2917.4 --> 2927.309
like it's it's a joke okay I I don't

2925.39 --> 2930.0389999999998
really appreciate it if people do that

2927.309 --> 2932.4300000000003
like really to somebody that is gay

2930.039 --> 2937.8590000000004
unless they're like acting really

2932.43 --> 2937.859
overkill gay if you know what I mean but

2939.18 --> 2947.71
it's complex just don't push it too much

2943.99 --> 2954.299
please don't want to get all riled up

2947.71 --> 2954.299
about that and chat if I can prevent it

2965.97 --> 2968.6899999999996
it

2975.76 --> 2983.71
right yeah well to be fair you know I my

2981.67 --> 2986.77
life have been surrounded by gay people

2983.71 --> 2988.98
no I'm not literally enough to it's just

2986.77 --> 2994.24
there they're everywhere

2988.98 --> 2996.7
it's okay I can deal with it it's the

2994.24 --> 3006.39
Netherlands and it's also I guess the

2996.7 --> 3012.39
scenes in my personal experience it's

3006.39 --> 3014.73
like gay people as in their character

3012.39 --> 3018.41
can be great as long as I just don't

3014.73 --> 3023.119
have to be confronted with any kind of

3018.41 --> 3023.1189999999997
sexual issue then I'm all great

3031.299 --> 3044.38
yeah very funny rope Wiggles yeah what

3038.589 --> 3049.89
about the term flat earther what it's a

3044.38 --> 3054.489
word it's it's a word that's been shamed

3049.89 --> 3056.679
that's yeah that's what it is people

3054.489 --> 3058.239
have been conditioned with that right

3056.679 --> 3064.2090000000003
but that's okay

3058.239 --> 3067.259
I don't mind because it's part of the

3064.209 --> 3071.019
fun foundations of the conditioning that

3067.259 --> 3075.789
we as flat earthers are trying to undo

3071.019 --> 3078.0089999999996
in the first place it's no use trying to

3075.789 --> 3086.279
change the terminology then we just be

3078.009 --> 3090.779
evading the problem you might evade it

3086.279 --> 3095.14
tip I don't know get a little a little

3090.779 --> 3098.529
appreciation or like the more chance by

3095.14 --> 3102.0389999999998
the system less flagging or whatever but

3098.529 --> 3105.609
for what we're effectively trying to

3102.039 --> 3107.949
achieve is the breaking of the original

3105.609 --> 3112.569
conditioning that made this all happen

3107.949 --> 3115.119
like it is in the first place it's no

3112.569 --> 3117.179
use to evade it if you really want that

3115.119 --> 3120.789
to happen then yeah

3117.179 --> 3123.539
you will be ridiculed until the

3120.789 --> 3123.539
conditioning is broken

3133.81 --> 3138.0
come on you guys still talking about

3135.91 --> 3138.0
that

3154.06 --> 3157.02
okay

3158.79 --> 3162.42
so yeah I answered your question

3160.53 --> 3166.44
concerning flat earther

3162.42 --> 3170.64
now you say help I'm in a box write it

3166.44 --> 3173.28
in it should be glad you're in a box

3170.64 --> 3175.1099999999997
because you because you're you are in a

3173.28 --> 3178.65
box that means that you can actually

3175.11 --> 3180.78
breathe we can have a natural cycle you

3178.65 --> 3184.07
know if you weren't in a box then yeah

way that he spoke earlier I think it is

3237.71 --> 3244.78
real him like this is too complex a role

3241.46 --> 3248.9
for any troll to just do that unless

3244.78 --> 3250.73
somebody that knows him really is trying

3248.9 --> 3254.39

3254.39 --> 3268.3399999999997
