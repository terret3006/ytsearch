so the weather today is

91.36 --> 94.72
blazing

91.94 --> 101.84
[Music]

94.72 --> 101.84
it's a bit little fluffy clouds up there

102.24 --> 107.759
so there's a bit of moist there was no

105.36 --> 110.96
rain or anything in the night

107.759 --> 113.759
but yeah it's a little bit of moist

110.96 --> 114.0
but it's still like really hot the sun

113.759 --> 118.32
is

114.0 --> 120.24
just blazing there's a bit of a breeze

118.32 --> 122.0
but it's like wind still at times so

120.24 --> 125.28
that gets really hot

122.0 --> 129.84
and i can see ripples of heat

125.28 --> 129.84
coming off the roof again

134.319 --> 140.07999999999998
i think this would be a really great day

136.239 --> 140.08
to have like a walk in the forest or

140.84 --> 143.84
something

148.08 --> 156.56
right so

152.0 --> 160.72
it's wednesday the 16th

156.56 --> 160.72
of june 2021

165.599 --> 172.72
all right and

168.8 --> 176.0
flat earth early virtual is live again

172.72 --> 178.959
all right hey drunkenbullet411 first to

176.0 --> 178.959
chat good to see you

179.12 --> 187.04
oh i got some tea here but this heat

182.8 --> 187.04000000000002
i wonder if that was really a smart idea

188.239 --> 203.68
just water it down a little cool it off

198.8 --> 203.68
oh just let that sit for a while

206.72 --> 213.04
so yeah i just uh

209.92 --> 214.79899999999998
took a shower like an hour ago was

213.04 --> 217.44
really necessary and it's really

214.799 --> 217.44
refreshing

217.76 --> 224.72
and my jaw's doing good i

221.36 --> 227.68
skipped on eating lasagna yesterday

224.72 --> 228.4
and kind of well i suspect already that

227.68 --> 230.0
if it's

228.4 --> 232.159
if like that what i talked about

230.0 --> 233.28
yesterday the milky cheese sauce if it

232.159 --> 236.64
has an influence then

233.28 --> 240.08
over time it'll probably get worse so

236.64 --> 242.07999999999998
i still have like one portion of it left

240.08 --> 244.0
but i think i'm just gonna throw it away

242.08 --> 245.36
even though that would normally be a sin

244.0 --> 246.959
and it did taste great

245.36 --> 249.36
but i think that it has been the

246.959 --> 252.56
influencing factor because today

249.36 --> 256.16
which is absolutely fine

252.56 --> 258.799
like nothing now so

256.16 --> 258.79900000000004
feeling great

260.72 --> 264.88000000000005
type of tea you're drinking well the

262.639 --> 268.8
same as always drunken bullet for one

264.88 --> 272.15999999999997
green tea organic green tea

268.8 --> 272.16
i always drink the same tea

272.24 --> 275.52
never drink black tea

276.72 --> 283.44000000000005
do like herb teas occasionally

279.759 --> 286.8
in the winter especially

283.44 --> 288.479
in the evenings or something but

286.8 --> 290.8
throughout the year i just drink green

288.479 --> 290.8
tea

291.199 --> 297.84000000000003
hey cameron kamigaza gilmore

294.32 --> 297.84
welcome to chat

301.759 --> 310.0
all right so yeah i got a bit of a weird

306.32 --> 312.88
personal news thingy uh

310.0 --> 314.32
remember that paper boy that the ballers

312.88 --> 319.199
like to call me

314.32 --> 319.199
like everybody a paper boy well uh

319.68 --> 324.0
after uh another week i'm not gonna be a

322.96 --> 325.68
paper boy anymore

324.0 --> 327.199
not because i got fired that would be

325.68 --> 329.199
ridiculous

327.199 --> 330.72
no it's just that it seems like the

329.199 --> 334.479
newspaper is

330.72 --> 337.03900000000004
kind of crumbling and so

334.479 --> 338.0
the neighborhood that i deliver papers

337.039 --> 340.639
in like

338.0 --> 341.68
basically the entire region of utrecht

340.639 --> 344.72
here

341.68 --> 348.96
has been scrapped from their system so

344.72 --> 348.96000000000004
yeah it's basically the job dissolved

349.039 --> 353.84
i'm a paper boy after this month no more

356.72 --> 362.72
and yeah in a way

359.759 --> 364.47900000000004
i don't really mind i never got anything

362.72 --> 367.03900000000004
financially out of it but i did

364.479 --> 367.68
kind of enjoy doing it and the challenge

367.039 --> 370.15999999999997
of it

367.68 --> 371.039
sometimes like especially when i

370.16 --> 372.96000000000004
wouldn't want to

371.039 --> 376.08
and i just do it anyway and it always

372.96 --> 376.08
made me feel really good

378.479 --> 382.4
i don't know why is this maybe it's

380.4 --> 384.15999999999997
because they've just let too much corona

382.4 --> 386.15999999999997
propaganda nonsense in there

384.16 --> 387.44
and hey i threw away the papers there's

386.16 --> 391.12
probably people

387.44 --> 395.84
others that might have done that too or

391.12 --> 395.84000000000003
people just thought like uh it sucks now

396.08 --> 400.639
i don't know what's going on they didn't

398.56 --> 401.199
exactly inform me to the details but i

400.639 --> 408.40000000000003
did get

401.199 --> 411.759
a letter

408.4 --> 422.79999999999995
this it's all dutch so it doesn't mean

411.759 --> 425.28000000000003
anything to you

422.8 --> 428.72
right although yeah they and now reading

425.28 --> 431.919
it looking again it says

428.72 --> 433.759
until further notice so

431.919 --> 436.31899999999996
it is really like the faltering of the

433.759 --> 439.039
company perhaps

436.319 --> 440.40000000000003
maybe they can't get enough staff maybe

439.039 --> 442.96
just not

440.4 --> 445.28
funding issues whatever i don't know but

442.96 --> 445.28
yeah

448.319 --> 452.08000000000004
how will they get the news well they

450.479 --> 455.039
just have to get it through the internet

452.08 --> 455.039
like everybody else

455.199 --> 459.039
but yeah i always thought that it was

456.88 --> 461.12
kind of a surface doing newspapers that

459.039 --> 461.919
are actually halfway decent they're not

461.12 --> 465.039
just

461.919 --> 467.35999999999996
freaking nazi newspapers like a lot of

465.039 --> 469.759
mainstream [ __ ]

467.36 --> 471.28000000000003
because this one was kind of decent and

469.759 --> 475.599
i thought like yeah at least like

471.28 --> 477.67999999999995
older people it's much better for them

475.599 --> 479.599
to get newspapers instead of staring at

477.68 --> 479.919
the screen because they're not used to

479.599 --> 482.15999999999997
it

479.919 --> 484.0
they've been growing up with newspapers

482.16 --> 485.91900000000004
so that just works more efficient to

484.0 --> 489.44
them they get more out of that

485.919 --> 493.28
and i yeah don't i'm not like

489.44 --> 495.52
oh good with the times older people

493.28 --> 497.919
because that's just a strain on them

495.52 --> 499.35999999999996
anyway

497.919 --> 501.84
but yeah there's nothing i could do

499.36 --> 501.84000000000003
about this

505.28 --> 509.19899999999996
can't eat shrimp anymore become allergic

508.56 --> 512.8
to them

509.199 --> 514.64
okay slow mo moon buggy or maybe you had

512.8 --> 521.8389999999999
a batch of bad shrimp

514.64 --> 521.8389999999999
you know depends on the source

525.68 --> 528.8
like you don't want to eat shitty shrimp

528.08 --> 531.12
and when i say

528.8 --> 531.92
shitty i literally mean shitty i mean

531.12 --> 535.839
shrimp that

531.92 --> 535.8389999999999
literally just

536.24 --> 542.72
hanging about in a tank of [ __ ] like

539.2 --> 542.72
really bad quality i don't know

546.0 --> 553.12
right if you got really organically bred

549.279 --> 555.12
really careful healthy shrimp

553.12 --> 556.9590000000001
you're probably not gonna get as much as

555.12 --> 559.76
a as a reaction out of it

556.959 --> 561.5189999999999
it's really like that well the garbage

559.76 --> 563.68
it's pollution it's just shitty

561.519 --> 566.08
like sewer pollution level [ __ ] it's

563.68 --> 569.8389999999999
like literally drenched in it

566.08 --> 573.44
now that's gonna give you a lot of

569.839 --> 575.519
issues bacterial infections even

573.44 --> 578.0
serious so you gotta be careful with

575.519 --> 580.0
that you can get really sick

578.0 --> 582.16
i don't eat shrimp at all by the way and

580.0 --> 582.56
the only form i eat shrimp and is like

582.16 --> 586.0799999999999
in the

582.56 --> 589.92
the chips thingy is it called

586.08 --> 592.64
krupak that's the only only form that i

589.92 --> 592.64
eat shrimp in

592.8 --> 595.1999999999999

that corona is [ __ ] that are like

630.839 --> 636.1600000000001
halfway

633.12 --> 638.32
critical thinking just on a very basic

636.16 --> 640.399
level critical thinking

638.32 --> 641.7600000000001
they will just say like yeah i don't

640.399 --> 643.36
want to have anything to do with it so

641.76 --> 645.2
every time that [ __ ] is shoved in their

643.36 --> 647.519

769.68 --> 773.8389999999999
hey tom parker

774.48 --> 778.72
i caught good servant yesterday going

777.44 --> 782.5600000000001
live twice but

778.72 --> 787.839
his phone battery kept overheating

782.56 --> 787.8389999999999
it's still a bit of fun to hang around

802.079 --> 808.6389999999999
uh yeah what did i do

805.519 --> 810.639
yesterday yeah yesterday

808.639 --> 814.0
of course flat earth debates was a lot

810.639 --> 817.839
of fun

814.0 --> 821.199
no ballers though or was there one

817.839 --> 824.8000000000001
while it was gone i don't think so

821.199 --> 828.88
uh did you

824.8 --> 831.279
join what

828.88 --> 835.199
no i didn't join him on the stream tom

831.279 --> 835.199
parker but i did get into chat

840.839 --> 843.839
right

844.24 --> 849.04
otherwise i'd probably end up rumpusing

846.399 --> 851.28
him constantly anyway i was really

849.04 --> 852.7199999999999
bouncy at the time

851.28 --> 854.959
[Music]

852.72 --> 856.5600000000001
but who knows maybe i'll do like a live

854.959 --> 858.6389999999999
stream together with good servant again

856.56 --> 861.279
at some point

858.639 --> 864.72
it's not a high priority but hey it's a

861.279 --> 864.72
buddy of mine we've done it before

865.36 --> 867.6800000000001
uh

869.279 --> 873.4399999999999
right so that was that

876.959 --> 884.399
what else remember that was doing all

879.92 --> 886.7199999999999
kinds of things what was it

884.399 --> 886.72
okay

887.44 --> 902.1600000000001
i have watched a movie also

899.44 --> 904.0
all right uh what's it called again oh

902.16 --> 907.36
yeah it was kind of a

904.0 --> 910.399
a drama crime

907.36 --> 913.6
bit of a thriller was really

910.399 --> 914.24
heavy on the drama but like the acting

913.6 --> 918.5600000000001
was like

914.24 --> 921.199
really intense called mystic river

918.56 --> 922.6389999999999
kevin bacon saw his head and just like

921.199 --> 924.8389999999999
oh

922.639 --> 927.04
that's gonna be interesting one way or

924.839 --> 929.839
another

927.04 --> 930.7199999999999
it was like a really crushing cop in

929.839 --> 934.0
here

930.72 --> 937.0400000000001
but like damn that movie that's like

934.0 --> 937.04
really heavy [ __ ]

938.839 --> 941.839
serious

947.92 --> 952.3199999999999
some really good actors in there overall

952.399 --> 955.6
doing really good acting and like the

954.399 --> 958.959
story at the end

955.6 --> 961.12
really makes sense like you really get

958.959 --> 961.1199999999999
it

962.48 --> 966.0790000000001
but it's like super heavy and it's

964.32 --> 967.759
really it's one of those movies about

966.079 --> 970.56
trauma

967.759 --> 972.5600000000001
serious serious guys is this is like

970.56 --> 975.5189999999999
this movie

972.56 --> 977.1199999999999
really kind of fits into the theme of a

975.519 --> 980.399
lot of [ __ ] that's

977.12 --> 980.399
going around right now

981.519 --> 985.44
it's basically about well child abuse

984.32 --> 988.88
trauma

985.44 --> 991.6800000000001
that's that's kind of the theme of it

988.88 --> 993.279
then it that becomes very clear early on

991.68 --> 995.519
and it's with that guy

993.279 --> 998.16
that that amazing actor what's his

995.519 --> 1000.32
forget his i'd never know his name

998.16 --> 1002.88
he's also like the the main character in

1000.32 --> 1005.36
jacob's ladder

1002.88 --> 1006.399
such a great like such an emotional

1005.36 --> 1008.639
character actor

1006.399 --> 1012.16
and he's like that in here too dude it's

1008.639 --> 1016.24
like that movie really made an impact

1012.16 --> 1019.4399999999999
scary too anyway

1016.24 --> 1022.88
very very adult movie definitely

1019.44 --> 1024.4
like don't let your kid watch this [ __ ]

1022.88 --> 1025.76
well they probably wouldn't even be

1024.4 --> 1028.959
interested

1025.76 --> 1028.959
it's just too harsh

1030.64 --> 1035.8390000000002
not like violent dominant but just

1033.6 --> 1039.039
really harsh reality [ __ ]

1035.839 --> 1040.559
right anyway you know i thought it was

1039.039 --> 1042.959
an experience and i had never seen it

1040.559 --> 1042.959
before

1045.76 --> 1049.52

1121.039 --> 1123.28

1124.16 --> 1130.16

1126.24 --> 1130.16
my opinion siri and he knows it

1131.36 --> 1137.84
like he crossed that line in a way that

1133.84 --> 1137.84
most people could never understand

1144.72 --> 1151.84
all right

1202.4 --> 1206.88
ah yes thank you cameron kamikaze

1205.28 --> 1209.76
gilmore

1206.88 --> 1209.7600000000002

1218.96 --> 1222.24
right yeah but don't worry about a

1220.88 --> 1225.0390000000002
drunken bullet one one

1222.24 --> 1225.679
four one one uh like just a little bit

1225.039 --> 1228.8799999999999
is good

1225.679 --> 1230.64
you know and hey if you're saying it

1228.88 --> 1232.24
yourself you can't give any more

1230.64 --> 1235.76
well then don't do it you know i don't

1232.24 --> 1239.919
want you to cut down on your own

1235.76 --> 1242.1589999999999
planned growth for yourself

1239.919 --> 1244.7990000000002
right that's i'd rather have you to

1242.159 --> 1247.44
invest that properly

1244.799 --> 1248.8799999999999
and then maybe get back later with well

1247.44 --> 1250.48
well with some more

1248.88 --> 1252.5590000000002
you know that's i'm trying to be

1250.48 --> 1255.6
pragmatic at it really

1252.559 --> 1259.2
like it's the best place to be when

1255.6 --> 1262.32
morality and pragmatism

1259.2 --> 1264.0
align right that's the best place to be

1262.32 --> 1266.6399999999999
so that's how i try to do it

1264.0 --> 1269.52
i want you guys to crush it to get

1266.64 --> 1272.7990000000002
better to overcome your obstacles

1269.52 --> 1275.6
so that in your route in life

1272.799 --> 1276.0
you will be able to attain more of

1275.6 --> 1278.6399999999999
things

1276.0 --> 1281.2
that you need and then yeah if you're

1278.64 --> 1284.0
doing better you can help others better

1281.2 --> 1291.8400000000001
right that's what i kind of that's kind

1284.0 --> 1291.84
of my setup here

1292.08 --> 1299.84
don't work bro yeah you do

1295.36 --> 1299.84
and it and it does help i really thank

1302.84 --> 1309.4399999999998
you

1305.52 --> 1309.44
all right uh

1311.12 --> 1314.32
i never use plastic straight up cash

1313.44 --> 1319.6000000000001
okay

1314.32 --> 1321.84
okay i i kind of like the plastic though

1319.6 --> 1324.3999999999999
well not that i like plastic it's just

1321.84 --> 1326.559
that yeah the cart system has been

1324.4 --> 1328.48
very efficient but i do think it is

1326.559 --> 1332.48
important

1328.48 --> 1336.32
just for variety an option

1332.48 --> 1339.52
that you can actually hold on to cash

1336.32 --> 1347.84
right for as long as it still

1339.52 --> 1347.84
does anything that is

1352.799 --> 1356.72
huh cameron kamikaze gilmore well that's

1356.24 --> 1360.32
funny

1356.72 --> 1363.6000000000001
that you should ask that can i

1360.32 --> 1365.6789999999999
or do i wear

1363.6 --> 1368.32
white tops in a positive mood than black

1365.679 --> 1368.3200000000002
in a negative

1368.64 --> 1376.4
no but funnily enough

1372.4 --> 1379.039
it does just directly influence my mood

1376.4 --> 1380.96
that's a fact and that's by the way why

1379.039 --> 1383.2
i've been wearing white

1380.96 --> 1384.48
even if i wear black over it that that's

1383.2 --> 1386.48
why i wear white underneath

1384.48 --> 1388.24
always now i have done so for pretty

1386.48 --> 1391.6
much uh

1388.24 --> 1396.64
one and a half maybe two years straight

1391.6 --> 1399.039
and it's overall improving

1396.64 --> 1399.76
but yeah why do i wear white in the

1399.039 --> 1401.52
summer

1399.76 --> 1404.32
that's because black is just too

1401.52 --> 1404.32
freaking hot

1406.48 --> 1411.52
so that's why you why you would rarely

1409.28 --> 1414.559
see me wear black

1411.52 --> 1416.48
in the summer now way back like in a

1414.559 --> 1418.3999999999999
flat earth talks days then i might

1416.48 --> 1420.48
be wearing black in the summer because i

1418.4 --> 1422.3200000000002
hadn't figured out the white shirt thing

1420.48 --> 1426.0
yet

1422.32 --> 1428.72
i only had black clothes yeah

1426.0 --> 1430.32
and now i have some white shirts on top

1428.72 --> 1445.679
of that

1430.32 --> 1448.24
and i'm really happy i did that

1445.679 --> 1448.72
but maybe factor is is that if i wear

1448.24 --> 1450.72
black

1448.72 --> 1452.64
over it even if it's like right

1450.72 --> 1454.48
underneath that maybe it just gets

1452.64 --> 1456.88
i might get a little bit more intense or

1454.48 --> 1456.88
something

1457.2 --> 1460.24
that might be a thing

1463.44 --> 1466.159
hello nathan

1468.88 --> 1473.8400000000001
had a freaky ad okay

1474.72 --> 1478.96
there's some really messed up ads out

1476.559 --> 1480.8799999999999
there like i've been watching some

1478.96 --> 1483.919
football games and [ __ ]

1480.88 --> 1485.0390000000002
like on the dutch television on the

1483.919 --> 1486.7990000000002
internet

1485.039 --> 1488.32
because yeah that's but it's basically

1486.799 --> 1490.799
the same channels as you would get on

1488.32 --> 1493.4399999999998
the television

1490.799 --> 1495.52
and they have some ads man just like oh

1493.44 --> 1498.88
my god and i thought that google ads

1495.52 --> 1502.48
could be bad holy [ __ ]

1498.88 --> 1505.919
now there's some really creepy [ __ ]

1502.48 --> 1511.2
in there sometimes and they're so

1505.919 --> 1512.5590000000002
sneaky they're so sneaky now

1511.2 --> 1514.559
it's like but maybe that's just

1512.559 --> 1518.32
specifically the dutch ads that

1514.559 --> 1518.96
the dutch ads just they dribble with

1518.32 --> 1522.24
like

1518.96 --> 1525.3600000000001
sneaky grabbles in there mind grabbles

1522.24 --> 1529.84
all over it it's crazy

1525.36 --> 1529.84
creeps me out sometimes

1533.12 --> 1543.84
okay well akuma virus maybe should cut

1535.279 --> 1543.84
down on the hard drugs then

1554.84 --> 1557.84
uh

1565.76 --> 1570.08
agent what food will be a commodity in

1568.159 --> 1570.4
the future and knowledge where to find

1570.08 --> 1575.9189999999999
it

1570.4 --> 1575.919
no no no knowledge how to grow it hm

1577.36 --> 1584.0
right and

1580.64 --> 1587.6000000000001
yeah maybe secret gardens right

1584.0 --> 1587.6
look think about it like this

1588.4 --> 1592.5590000000002
if there's like and this is like even in

1591.12 --> 1593.84
the netherlands still a thing it's

1592.559 --> 1595.2
probably going to be like that for a

1593.84 --> 1597.4399999999998
while

1595.2 --> 1599.039
because of the cannabis policy now this

1597.44 --> 1599.76
has nothing to do with the drugs itself

1599.039 --> 1602.24
but

1599.76 --> 1603.44
just the growing policy is like yeah

1602.24 --> 1606.48
there's growers

1603.44 --> 1607.8400000000001
and it's kind of they have to keep it a

1606.48 --> 1612.0
secret so they

1607.84 --> 1614.1589999999999
try to get very efficient

1612.0 --> 1616.48
just keep basically have little secret

1614.159 --> 1619.6000000000001
gardens where they breed it

1616.48 --> 1620.08
right well if they can do that then that

1619.6 --> 1624.0
means

1620.08 --> 1627.32
you could do that with food

1624.0 --> 1630.08
so yeah if if it would go as far as

1627.32 --> 1630.96
totalitarian nazi [ __ ] as you could

1630.08 --> 1633.12
imagine

1630.96 --> 1634.96
that you can't that you're literally not

1633.12 --> 1638.08
allowed to grow your own food for

1634.96 --> 1640.08
crazy reasons then people will just have

1638.08 --> 1643.6
secret gardens and they will find a way

1640.08 --> 1646.6399999999999
to get electricity for it efficiently

1643.6 --> 1649.1999999999998
solar panels perhaps

1646.64 --> 1650.88
and just nobody will ever know they will

1649.2 --> 1654.0800000000002
have brilliant

1650.88 --> 1655.44
vegetable gardens inside a building

1654.08 --> 1657.1999999999998
somewhere maybe in their basement or

1655.44 --> 1658.88
whatever

1657.2 --> 1662.0
and they will be able to live off that

1658.88 --> 1669.8400000000001
so it's not where to find food no

1662.0 --> 1669.84
it's how to grow it

1675.12 --> 1678.7199999999998
and it is prophesied oh geez i i didn't

1677.76 --> 1682.08
even know that

1678.72 --> 1684.96
like i serious guys i'm very much

1682.08 --> 1686.6399999999999
a fan of jesus christ and the bible i

1684.96 --> 1689.44
have my own

1686.64 --> 1690.0
my own interpretation my own eclectic

1689.44 --> 1692.559
route

1690.0 --> 1694.08
everybody knows that now and i'm glad

1692.559 --> 1695.36
that most of you are able to kind of

1694.08 --> 1698.6399999999999
respect it

1695.36 --> 1701.039
for what it is but

1698.64 --> 1702.0
when it comes to like the end times and

1701.039 --> 1705.84
[ __ ]

1702.0 --> 1709.2
i've never really

1705.84 --> 1711.12
read it all and like got enthusiastic

1709.2 --> 1711.8400000000001
wanted to memorize i've never been about

1711.12 --> 1713.84
that

1711.84 --> 1715.52
i've seen a lot of people just go

1713.84 --> 1719.36
totally savonia

1715.52 --> 1722.399
over that so i actively avoided it

1719.36 --> 1725.9189999999999
and instead what i do is go

1722.399 --> 1729.6789999999999
by pure logic and

1725.919 --> 1732.5590000000002
frequency morality and that way

1729.679 --> 1735.76
you might be noticing right now i come

1732.559 --> 1738.8799999999999
to the same conclusions

1735.76 --> 1742.1589999999999
right i can predict it not

1738.88 --> 1745.6000000000001
having known end time details

1742.159 --> 1747.919
you see how that works and that's

1745.6 --> 1750.399
to me actually more proof that it

1747.919 --> 1752.72
probably is real

1750.399 --> 1754.7199999999998
it's just that i don't want to be sucked

1752.72 --> 1758.48
into that

1754.72 --> 1760.32
that finality of it

1758.48 --> 1761.76
right there's a finality to the

1760.32 --> 1765.52
apocalypse

1761.76 --> 1765.52
or what is it uh the revelation

1765.84 --> 1773.9189999999999
end times in the bible and i

1770.32 --> 1777.36
actively refuse i reject

1773.919 --> 1779.6000000000001
i believe we can win and

1777.36 --> 1780.6399999999999
if it means that i can't then i will

1779.6 --> 1784.24
keep believing

1780.64 --> 1787.6000000000001
until i can no longer

1784.24 --> 1792.0
but i have gone through a lot

1787.6 --> 1792.799
in my life mentally tortures things that

1792.0 --> 1795.76
most people

1792.799 --> 1797.84
think god will never have to know or

1795.76 --> 1800.08
feel anything close to that

1797.84 --> 1801.36
right and and but unfortunately there's

1800.08 --> 1803.039
other people that have

1801.36 --> 1804.8799999999999
gone through even worse things and

1803.039 --> 1809.12
they've lost themselves and it's

1804.88 --> 1812.3200000000002
it's like a tragedy and

1809.12 --> 1814.6399999999999
problematic as [ __ ] in unbelievable

1812.32 --> 1817.76
amounts of ways

1814.64 --> 1821.3600000000001
i've been spared for that

1817.76 --> 1822.72
depth of breaking maybe thanks to my

1821.36 --> 1825.12
skills

1822.72 --> 1827.44
maybe thanks to what god gave me in my

1825.12 --> 1831.6
talents i don't know

1827.44 --> 1834.72
but now i'm losing track

1831.6 --> 1836.32
what was that talking about right yeah

1834.72 --> 1840.24
the end times i

1836.32 --> 1840.72
i'm i'm like a i really believe in the

1840.24 --> 1843.44
truth

1840.72 --> 1843.44
revolution

1845.039 --> 1851.76
and yeah

1849.76 --> 1853.52
every time i think about it again it's

1851.76 --> 1858.32
like no

1853.52 --> 1861.9189999999999
jesus didn't die he wouldn't have had to

1858.32 --> 1865.4399999999998
why would he have had to because

1861.919 --> 1869.44
everybody said it

1865.44 --> 1871.8400000000001
right but that's people saying it

1869.44 --> 1873.279
and just as with the apocalypse yeah

1871.84 --> 1876.9599999999998
it's a future vision but

1873.279 --> 1879.039
is it like absolutely inevitable or is

1876.96 --> 1882.159
it just like

1879.039 --> 1882.96
a ladder a ladder that will always be

1882.159 --> 1885.0390000000002
there

1882.96 --> 1887.039
and anybody who finds the ladder might

1885.039 --> 1890.1589999999999
actually climb the ladder and go

1887.039 --> 1891.519
through all those steps right and that

1890.159 --> 1896.3200000000002
even feeds back into

1891.519 --> 1900.24
my original idea that this might be

1896.32 --> 1900.24
an apocalypse enactment

1900.48 --> 1905.1200000000001
that it's not really the actual end of

1903.679 --> 1908.159
the world

1905.12 --> 1911.76
scenario but that they

1908.159 --> 1914.7990000000002
are acting like that they're basically

1911.76 --> 1915.84
following it as a guide because it's

1914.799 --> 1918.08
written down

1915.84 --> 1919.6789999999999
and i thought hey yeah that's actually

1918.08 --> 1922.799
really efficient

1919.679 --> 1927.6000000000001
and because they're so arrogant

1922.799 --> 1927.6
they just did it defiant

1928.399 --> 1933.6789999999999
or maybe so anti-god that they just

1930.72 --> 1936.24
loved it and just had to do it

1933.679 --> 1936.88
i don't know how sick it really was

1936.24 --> 1939.039
right

1936.88 --> 1940.3200000000002
but yeah i don't think that at the end

1939.039 --> 1942.08
of this run

1940.32 --> 1944.799
that we're going through the world is

1942.08 --> 1948.48
gonna blow up i don't think so man

1944.799 --> 1951.9189999999999
i think this is

1948.48 --> 1953.039
the same pattern but on a different

1951.919 --> 1957.76
frequency

1953.039 --> 1957.76
this is more a spiritual apocalypse

1958.72 --> 1964.88
not a physical one although yeah we are

1962.08 --> 1965.6
also getting [ __ ] around with

1964.88 --> 1968.3200000000002
physically

1965.6 --> 1970.7199999999998
some people through the vaccine that

1968.32 --> 1974.24
aren't vaccines of course

1970.72 --> 1974.24
i hope you understand what i mean

1975.6 --> 1983.12
i think it's natural that this happens

1979.6 --> 1986.1589999999999
although it so much does seem

1983.12 --> 1989.12
seem to come together but even like

1986.159 --> 1990.0800000000002
spiritual synchronicities and like what

1989.12 --> 1992.799
happens when you

1990.08 --> 1994.08
align with the principles of god and

1992.799 --> 1997.2
truth

1994.08 --> 2000.799
right what happens the synchronicities

1997.2 --> 2002.32
is that because it's the apocalypse and

2000.799 --> 2006.1589999999999
it is said to be there

2002.32 --> 2010.0
or is that simply the natural effect

2006.159 --> 2011.279
from that ladder that is always there

2010.0 --> 2019.84
for people to find

2011.279 --> 2021.919
in reality see

2019.84 --> 2023.6
like there's a letter into the darkness

2021.919 --> 2025.519
and there's a letter into the light

2023.6 --> 2027.36
and they've always been there it's by

2025.519 --> 2029.44
god's design

2027.36 --> 2030.559
it's the the staircase of ascension it's

2029.44 --> 2034.559
also what i think that

2030.559 --> 2037.84
originally the idea of the pyramid

2034.559 --> 2041.6789999999999
was about as a staircase

2037.84 --> 2045.6
in freemasonry and then they

2041.679 --> 2049.04
reify it into classism

2045.6 --> 2052.0
right so they warp it

2049.04 --> 2054.32
so it's right there they stole this

2052.0 --> 2058.399
symbol of spiritual ascension and then

2054.32 --> 2061.119
replaced it with grappler control levels

2058.399 --> 2062.3199999999997
and that's to kind of make it there in

2061.119 --> 2064.56
plain sight

2062.32 --> 2065.44
without you realizing what it is it's

2064.56 --> 2068.56
actually

2065.44 --> 2075.839
making you lose that spark inside well

2068.56 --> 2075.839
it didn't work on me

2077.599 --> 2085.04
yeah well son yin

2081.119 --> 2089.839
gohan zero that's

2085.04 --> 2089.839
that doesn't make any logical sense

2090.399 --> 2097.839
it doesn't literally what you say

2094.8 --> 2099.3590000000004
is just he had to do this because of

2097.839 --> 2102.48
that

2099.359 --> 2105.7599999999998
it literally makes no sense like

2102.48 --> 2107.92
how is the logic why don't you determine

2105.76 --> 2108.5600000000004
the logic of the sentence you just put

2107.92 --> 2110.48
down

2108.56 --> 2112.0789999999997
yeah i don't care if he's right i know

2110.48 --> 2114.32
what the chant is

2112.079 --> 2115.8390000000004
well why don't you try to analyze the

2114.32 --> 2118.48
chant logically and

2115.839 --> 2120.4
actually think about what it says and

2118.48 --> 2123.359
then equate it with everything else that

2120.4 --> 2126.64
you learn the patterns the frequencies

2123.359 --> 2131.04
the frequencies of the actions it makes

2126.64 --> 2135.2799999999997
no sense

2131.04 --> 2139.04
why would the creator of all things

2135.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
need a slaughter to achieve anything

2139.04 --> 2145.839
makes no sense

2155.359 --> 2160.96
right well a kumo virus that coming from

2157.52 --> 2164.4
uv means very little to me

2160.96 --> 2164.4
right i think

2164.57 --> 2168.0190000000002
[Music]

2169.119 --> 2174.48
i think that it's a gravel really it's a

2171.68 --> 2177.68
really powerful one

2174.48 --> 2182.0
it's the ram the sacrifice

2177.68 --> 2182.0
to a key position once again

2182.96 --> 2189.2
isn't sacrifice blood sacrifice

2186.079 --> 2191.2000000000003
for anything bad

2189.2 --> 2192.3999999999996
unless of course you sacrifice your

2191.2 --> 2195.9199999999996
personal

2192.4 --> 2198.839
dedication blood tears and sweat

2195.92 --> 2200.8
for your personal things right that's

2198.839 --> 2203.92
different

2200.8 --> 2206.7200000000003
but to sacrifice something else

2203.92 --> 2207.76
another individual to achieve anything

2206.72 --> 2215.4399999999996
is

2207.76 --> 2219.0400000000004
straight straight in opposition

2215.44 --> 2219.04
of basically god's laws

2219.839 --> 2224.96
right thou shalt not kill oh but but

2225.839 --> 2229.839
sacrifice is okay

2231.92 --> 2236.079
like oh but it but god did it so he can

2234.8 --> 2239.3590000000004
do that

2236.079 --> 2242.2400000000002
well why would everybody then chant

2239.359 --> 2243.7599999999998
that thing that god did that we're not

2242.24 --> 2246.72
supposed to do

2243.76 --> 2248.0
for all eternity and make it the primary

2246.72 --> 2249.839
thing

2248.0 --> 2251.52
the key to hold it all together

2249.839 --> 2255.04
supposedly

2251.52 --> 2255.04
right it's a

2255.52 --> 2260.32
it makes no logical sense guys i i know

2258.4 --> 2264.1600000000003
this is really hard stuff

2260.32 --> 2265.44
for a lot of you and i really don't mean

2264.16 --> 2268.3199999999997
to disrespect i

2265.44 --> 2268.88
humble myself before christ and oh my

2268.32 --> 2272.079
god

2268.88 --> 2272.96
if i'm wrong right if i'm really really

2272.079 --> 2276.4
wrong

2272.96 --> 2279.359
then i will humbly kiss jesus's feet

2276.4 --> 2280.0
when he returns or when i die and i face

2279.359 --> 2283.2799999999997
him

2280.0 --> 2285.68
to apologize but i

2283.28 --> 2289.0400000000004
really think this is a trick i really i

2285.68 --> 2289.04
am convinced it's wrong

2294.0 --> 2299.839
i think it's a mistake

2307.119 --> 2315.04
i won't be able to okay well

2310.8 --> 2318.079
dude you know what if god

2315.04 --> 2318.56
the creator of all things demands that i

2318.079 --> 2321.3590000000004
believe

2318.56 --> 2321.92
something that makes no sense to me and

2321.359 --> 2325.359
to me

2321.92 --> 2326.0
seems to violate every core essence law

2325.359 --> 2329.7599999999998
that he

2326.0 --> 2332.8
actually gave man within creation

2329.76 --> 2336.96
and he sends me to hell

2332.8 --> 2340.88
because i try to find the purest

2336.96 --> 2344.2400000000002
frequency logic logos

2340.88 --> 2349.52
truth within everything that's happened

2344.24 --> 2349.52
then so be it then i should be in hell

2350.16 --> 2354.7999999999997
but i don't believe god is like that i

2352.32 --> 2356.2400000000002
believe god is truth and i believe that

2354.8 --> 2359.6800000000003
the truth demands

2356.24 --> 2359.68
testing of anything

2361.839 --> 2367.52
especially the holy things that

2364.88 --> 2368.1600000000003
seem holy or that are put on this holy

2367.52 --> 2371.119
pedestal

2368.16 --> 2371.1189999999997
in people's minds

2371.76 --> 2376.6400000000003
that is what faith is no i have faith in

2374.56 --> 2378.16
god i have faith in the design i have

2376.64 --> 2382.24
faith in

2378.16 --> 2385.44
in in reality and the logic of

2382.24 --> 2387.1189999999997
things and the differentiation between

2385.44 --> 2390.96
illusions that drive us

2387.119 --> 2394.079
and the truth that drives us yeah

2390.96 --> 2396.8
that's my faith i have faith in how in

2394.079 --> 2400.079
my senses in how reality turns out to be

2396.8 --> 2400.079
how the mind works

2400.72 --> 2405.7599999999998
and in the design of of the mighty

2403.76 --> 2408.3190000000004
creator

2405.76 --> 2410.079
and in the words of jesus christ and his

2408.319 --> 2413.359
teachings his vision his

2410.079 --> 2416.4
mighty mighty vision

2413.359 --> 2418.96
this endless fruits spiritually

2416.4 --> 2420.1600000000003
right that's what i have faith in and

2418.96 --> 2425.2
i've tested that

2420.16 --> 2428.3999999999996
faith yeah so

2425.2 --> 2430.56
you holding on to some riddle

2428.4 --> 2431.44
that actually when you analyze it

2430.56 --> 2435.599
critically

2431.44 --> 2440.0
it contradicts the most critical

2435.599 --> 2440.0
laws of god towards men

2443.839 --> 2446.4
i'm sorry

2448.64 --> 2453.839
i think you got gravel

2459.599 --> 2469.92
okay george stanford here

2467.599 --> 2469.92
right

2470.8 --> 2473.929
[Music]

2477.119 --> 2480.2400000000002
do i have enough faith to believe he

2479.04 --> 2482.56
died and rose again

2480.24 --> 2483.2799999999997
well i think actually i have more faith

2482.56 --> 2485.359
in him i

2483.28 --> 2486.48
have so much faith in christ that i

2485.359 --> 2489.2799999999997
believe

2486.48 --> 2489.599
that he could literally die to a point

2489.28 --> 2493.3590000000004
that

2489.599 --> 2495.839
everybody felt he died and then he could

2493.359 --> 2495.839
himself

2496.8 --> 2499.76
awaken from that

2500.319 --> 2506.72
re yeah resurrect

2503.52 --> 2509.04
but is that god in him

2506.72 --> 2511.1189999999997
it's just that i don't think like what

2509.04 --> 2515.52
is death isn't death that you die

2511.119 --> 2517.88
and then you leave right

2515.52 --> 2520.0
i think he survived it really

2517.88 --> 2523.04
miraculously

2520.0 --> 2525.839
like any any normal man would just

2523.04 --> 2527.92
absolutely be dead and i think he might

2525.839 --> 2537.839
have survived it and i think that's

2527.92 --> 2537.839
very miraculous

2540.88 --> 2545.44
hey i killed the hope i'm time to see

2548.88 --> 2552.88
no good servant that's ridiculous

2553.2 --> 2559.7599999999998
effectively what i'm saying is equatable

2556.56 --> 2562.72
to resurrection i'm just saying that

2559.76 --> 2563.5200000000004
he might have just not entirely died

2562.72 --> 2567.2799999999997
which is

2563.52 --> 2570.319
a miracle it's a miracle guys

2567.28 --> 2574.4
nobody could survive that but he

2570.319 --> 2574.4
is freaking god in the flesh

2575.52 --> 2579.839
gods don't die

2580.4 --> 2587.28
but hey dude that's just my

2583.599 --> 2591.2000000000003
my love right my love for him my

2587.28 --> 2591.2000000000003
like deep admiration

2591.359 --> 2598.4
and i might be wrong he might have died

2595.04 --> 2600.88
and then indeed resurrected

2598.4 --> 2601.76
and then i'd have just faith just the

2600.88 --> 2604.96
same

2601.76 --> 2609.44
right but i reserve the right

2604.96 --> 2613.359
to let my mind test things critically

2609.44 --> 2616.88
and to consider other things

2613.359 --> 2620.4
and to not not let people tell you

2616.88 --> 2621.28
no you cannot question this you will go

2620.4 --> 2624.4
to hell

2621.28 --> 2627.6800000000003
you're no longer a christian i will

2624.4 --> 2627.6800000000003
not accept this

2627.839 --> 2635.68
you can't freaking tell me

2631.2 --> 2639.4399999999996
what i need to chant in order to be

2635.68 --> 2649.839
accepted by the freaking creator of

2639.44 --> 2649.839
all okay

2660.839 --> 2663.839
ugh

2669.52 --> 2673.2
private interpretation well what is a

2671.359 --> 2675.04
private interpretation

2673.2 --> 2677.2
you know what if a private

2675.04 --> 2680.4
interpretation

2677.2 --> 2680.3999999999996
is really like oh

2681.52 --> 2688.0
yeah let's make that the consensus

2684.88 --> 2690.0
council let's do that oh and then it's

2688.0 --> 2692.72
not a private conclusion anymore because

2690.0 --> 2695.119
now everybody's chanting it so then it's

2692.72 --> 2695.1189999999997
okay

2696.56 --> 2703.68
andrew that is okay

2699.839 --> 2705.7599999999998
grabblers all go oh yeah

2703.68 --> 2707.04
yeah let's just make this the new

2705.76 --> 2710.55
consensus oh

2707.04 --> 2713.669
we could get so much control over this

2710.55 --> 2713.6690000000003
[Music]

2730.839 --> 2733.839
to

2742.4 --> 2745.52
thank you cameron kamikaze gilmore and

2744.24 --> 2749.04
that's what matters

2745.52 --> 2753.839
dude his words the things that he did

2749.04 --> 2753.839
and why and the vision he had are

2758.839 --> 2764.0
unmistakable

2760.0 --> 2766.24
right so isn't that much more important

2764.0 --> 2768.56
the lessons to learn

2766.24 --> 2769.4399999999996
that the things to confront yourself

2768.56 --> 2772.839
with

2769.44 --> 2775.359
isn't that much more intrical to the

2772.839 --> 2779.52
actual

2775.359 --> 2779.52
act of being a christian

2780.56 --> 2784.4
following the path then to chant a

2783.76 --> 2787.92
riddle

2784.4 --> 2789.04
and say no he had to die or it's all for

2787.92 --> 2790.88
nothing

2789.04 --> 2803.839
and you're not a christian if you don't

2790.88 --> 2803.839
believe it

2812.96 --> 2816.2400000000002
oh well serving

2817.76 --> 2824.5600000000004
zero yeah well the old testament

2820.88 --> 2824.56
is that is that the creator

2824.72 --> 2831.839
or is that a test i think the old

2827.599 --> 2831.839
testament is a giant test

2845.04 --> 2852.319
it is called faith well you

2848.079 --> 2852.96
have faith then and go to hangouts where

2852.319 --> 2855.359
they just

2852.96 --> 2856.0
chant all day and keep repeating the

2855.359 --> 2858.16
same [ __ ]

2856.0 --> 2859.839
over and over again and everybody feels

2858.16 --> 2863.2
all blessed

2859.839 --> 2868.0789999999997
go there then right over here

2863.2 --> 2868.0789999999997
i test things i criticize things

2868.24 --> 2875.359
and i take it very very seriously

2873.76 --> 2877.0400000000004
and yeah you're going to have to deal

2875.359 --> 2878.48
with that if you want to be part of this

2877.04 --> 2882.16
show

2878.48 --> 2884.96
if you want to yeah remain on good

2882.16 --> 2887.5989999999997
grounds in my chat

2884.96 --> 2888.16
right you don't have to agree with it

2887.599 --> 2901.839
but you

2888.16 --> 2901.839
are going to have to think about it

2912.839 --> 2915.839
um

2921.04 --> 2929.359
it's like series what about

2925.839 --> 2934.0
what jesus taught

2929.359 --> 2934.0
and the power he wielded through god

2934.24 --> 2941.2799999999997
what he was probably right what the hell

2937.68 --> 2943.68
does it matter like some object

2941.28 --> 2944.4
why would you latch on to the esoteric

2943.68 --> 2948.24
like that why

2944.4 --> 2950.88
why does it matter when you got

2948.24 --> 2952.64
the message right there it's right there

2950.88 --> 2955.2000000000003
that's the power

2952.64 --> 2956.96
it's the message it's not something that

2955.2 --> 2960.8799999999997
christ touched

2956.96 --> 2965.04
it's the message it's the it's the open

2960.88 --> 2971.839
staircase right there that's the power

2965.04 --> 2971.839
it's not objects this is ridiculous

2985.75 --> 2988.8
[Music]

2996.839 --> 2999.839
so

3005.599 --> 3009.92
all right well look maybe there are very

3008.48 --> 3011.2
interesting stories about these

3009.92 --> 3014.079
artifacts hell

3011.2 --> 3016.64
just look at my personal inspiration

3014.079 --> 3020.079
with the idea of the holy grail

3016.64 --> 3021.2799999999997
i have a personal dream like fascination

3020.079 --> 3024.7200000000003
with it

3021.28 --> 3027.8390000000004
also because jesus used that

3024.72 --> 3027.839
in that intense time

3029.92 --> 3033.359
right so i have a fascination with the

3032.16 --> 3037.52
idea of it but

3033.359 --> 3040.7999999999997
i'm not going to be lured into some

3037.52 --> 3044.64
gravel hunt for physical goods

3040.8 --> 3055.8390000000004
and the power to attain

3044.64 --> 3055.839
when the real power is in christ's words

3058.079 --> 3063.92
did you know jesus could have chosen to

3060.8 --> 3063.92
have a legion of

3066.839 --> 3069.839
really

3073.52 --> 3076.8
well have you ever considered that it

3075.119 --> 3079.92
was kind of critical that

3076.8 --> 3082.7200000000003
he would be perceived as dead

3079.92 --> 3084.0
in order for the romans to stop

3082.72 --> 3086.64
persecuting

3084.0 --> 3086.64
him and

3087.76 --> 3090.88
and kind of that the whole situation

3090.0 --> 3094.079
would just

3090.88 --> 3096.8
settle down because

3094.079 --> 3099.44
war might have broken out if he would

3096.8 --> 3099.44
have resisted

3099.839 --> 3104.24
or something you know that's always the

3101.68 --> 3106.72
feeling that i got so i see it as just

3104.24 --> 3106.72
he did

3107.76 --> 3114.1600000000003
guys you guys are obviously not the

3109.68 --> 3114.16
audience to speculate about this with

3117.68 --> 3122.64
i just see an entirely different logical

3120.559 --> 3128.079
interpretation of it and it

3122.64 --> 3130.96
it doesn't violate it doesn't violate

3128.079 --> 3131.8390000000004
if this if this interpretation that i

3130.96 --> 3134.319
have

3131.839 --> 3135.68
of a possibility of what would have

3134.319 --> 3137.839
happened

3135.68 --> 3140.16
it's not a violation of any of god's

3137.839 --> 3140.16
laws

3150.839 --> 3153.839
okay

3159.68 --> 3163.2
it violates everything oh you mean it

3162.24 --> 3165.4399999999996
violates

3163.2 --> 3166.96
the chant that doesn't make any sense

3165.44 --> 3170.319
and actually violates

3166.96 --> 3173.76
god's primary laws

3170.319 --> 3173.7599999999998
but it's okay if he does it

3174.319 --> 3179.04
right it's up to me yeah it is up to me

3177.359 --> 3182.7999999999997
it's up to me to critically

3179.04 --> 3184.96
respond to that and if you guys are

3182.8 --> 3188.1600000000003
gonna double down on this [ __ ] i will

3184.96 --> 3191.68
end up banning the lot of you

3188.16 --> 3194.7999999999997
let it go i have a right

3191.68 --> 3198.5589999999997
to analyze it and to be critical

3194.8 --> 3200.7200000000003
in my response i will be honest

3198.559 --> 3203.92
and i will keep pointing out the things

3200.72 --> 3206.16
that matters most

3203.92 --> 3207.6800000000003
and this thing this riddle that

3206.16 --> 3210.319
everybody keeps chanting

3207.68 --> 3210.96
that doesn't make any logical sense that

3210.319 --> 3214.4
wouldn't be

3210.96 --> 3217.52
necessary for anything really right

3214.4 --> 3219.76
god can do it why it it's literally an

3217.52 --> 3223.839
action that violates the laws he gave

3219.76 --> 3223.8390000000004
for man

3226.88 --> 3231.28
we needed a secret oh you needed it oh

3229.599 --> 3233.92
you needed it oh really

3231.28 --> 3234.8
well guess what jesus christ was

3233.92 --> 3238.96
absolutely

3234.8 --> 3242.8
not for that [ __ ] okay

3238.96 --> 3246.079
jesus said to stop doing that

3242.8 --> 3250.88
stop sacrificing right

3246.079 --> 3254.2400000000002
hello and now you're straight back

3250.88 --> 3257.52
straight back now he

3254.24 --> 3261.04
is made that thing that he's told

3257.52 --> 3262.72
everybody not to do anymore how is that

3261.04 --> 3265.839
karmic justice

3262.72 --> 3265.839
tom parker

3269.44 --> 3273.359
that feels like a gravel to me

3276.839 --> 3279.839
okay

3285.76 --> 3290.88
yeah well george sanford yeah he did say

3288.559 --> 3290.88
things

3291.2 --> 3297.1189999999997
and the words are telling

3294.559 --> 3297.599
right to me technically it doesn't even

3297.119 --> 3300.7200000000003
matter

3297.599 --> 3303.119
if it never came from a singular man

3300.72 --> 3303.9199999999996
although yeah it's more likely that it

3303.119 --> 3306.96
is

3303.92 --> 3311.76
but the power of what he says

3306.96 --> 3311.76
the truth in what he says is universal

3317.599 --> 3322.0
love a good love of spit roasted lamb

3319.76 --> 3325.8390000000004
hey dude well if it's for food

3322.0 --> 3329.119
sure but that's for food

3325.839 --> 3329.599
right that's okay because you're eating

3329.119 --> 3335.839
it

3329.599 --> 3335.839
you're doing it to maintain yourself

3353.119 --> 3357.6800000000003
okay cameron kamikaze gilmore uh

3357.839 --> 3363.839
good to know

3375.68 --> 3391.839
i'm gonna need a break guys this is

3377.76 --> 3391.8390000000004
really tiresome

3430.839 --> 3433.839
um

3486.839 --> 3489.839
so

3514.839 --> 3517.839
so

3551.92 --> 3559.839
i'm just giving the bird some water i'll

3553.76 --> 3559.8390000000004
be back

3570.839 --> 3573.839
so

3584.839 --> 3587.839
uh

3596.96 --> 3601.68
all right word of god jesus is the word

3600.64 --> 3615.839
of god in the flesh

3601.68 --> 3615.839
yeah absolutely

3618.72 --> 3622.9599999999996
no you didn't break me i'm just a little

3621.04 --> 3624.5589999999997
disappointed and getting tired of all

3622.96 --> 3626.839
the chanting

3624.559 --> 3629.599
like literally you're literally like

3626.839 --> 3632.64
chanting like your ballers

3629.599 --> 3636.2400000000002
defending your chance that you hold on

3632.64 --> 3636.24
like your life is on the line

3638.24 --> 3643.839
i'm a little disappointed

3660.0 --> 3671.839
okay drunken bullet for one take it easy

3662.4 --> 3671.839
get enough water

3692.88 --> 3702.96
seems more like i've broken the chat

3699.2 --> 3713.839
yeah that's fine sun yin gohan

3702.96 --> 3713.839
i understand that i get that

3745.52 --> 3753.119
his word says he died and rose again

3749.119 --> 3755.839
his word which which is his

3753.119 --> 3755.839
who said it

3780.119 --> 3797.839
drunkenbullet411 take it easy bro

3782.799 --> 3797.839
don't do it just call it for the night

3802.16 --> 3811.839
all right

3812.4 --> 3817.2000000000003
i really wonder what owen benjamin would

3814.48 --> 3819.119
have to say of my conception

3817.2 --> 3821.2
because at least he's criticized the

3819.119 --> 3822.839
trinity let's not start about that

3821.2 --> 3826.0789999999997
thanks

3822.839 --> 3839.839
right but i wonder what he has to say

3826.079 --> 3839.8390000000004
about my idea

3842.079 --> 3846.079
or maybe my idea is a little too hot to

3844.559 --> 3848.48
handle

3846.079 --> 3850.8390000000004
i don't know it seems like it there's

3848.48 --> 3855.76
very few people that have even

3850.839 --> 3855.7599999999998
accepted me doing that

3860.4 --> 3867.44
i'm only trying to be true to the truth

3863.92 --> 3870.96
my oath the paladin

3867.44 --> 3880.48
the truth and that includes the truth

3870.96 --> 3885.359
that you don't want to know

3880.48 --> 3888.48
right the only way to get through

3885.359 --> 3891.52
is to break the obstacles and find

3888.48 --> 3892.079
that way through and that hurts you have

3891.52 --> 3894.319
to

3892.079 --> 3895.76
break the obstacles you have to get past

3894.319 --> 3898.64
it

3895.76 --> 3900.4
otherwise you'll just be there forever

3898.64 --> 3909.839
it will always be there

3900.4 --> 3909.839
in the way

3912.319 --> 3918.64
right and in this case the obstacle

3915.44 --> 3922.4
is not that jesus even supposedly

3918.64 --> 3924.799
allegedly died for our sins is some

3922.4 --> 3930.64
sacrificial lamb

3924.799 --> 3930.64
it's that it's not up for discussion

3931.359 --> 3939.839
yeah that's the obstacle

3936.0 --> 3943.039
that it's not up for discussion for you

3939.839 --> 3947.2799999999997
do you understand that's the obstacle

3943.039 --> 3947.28
it's not whether it is true or not

3948.24 --> 3951.2799999999997
that it might turn out to be a lot now

3950.079 --> 3954.319
it's that it's not

3951.28 --> 3954.3190000000004
up for discussion

3954.799 --> 3960.4
that's the obstacle that's the obstacle

3957.2 --> 3964.5589999999997
i'm trying to get through

3960.4 --> 3968.48
right we need to apply

3964.559 --> 3971.28
logos we need to learn

3968.48 --> 3973.68
and remember all the lessons and the

3971.28 --> 3975.8390000000004
frequencies

3973.68 --> 3977.5989999999997
if something doesn't make sense with

3975.839 --> 3979.839
everything else then there's something

3977.599 --> 3979.839
wrong

3984.079 --> 3991.6800000000003
that doesn't nullify everything

3987.92 --> 3996.559
it just means there is something wrong

3991.68 --> 3996.5589999999997
then that might be misinterpretation

3996.799 --> 4000.4
or a cover story and it wouldn't

3999.76 --> 4002.88
literally

4000.4 --> 4003.839
even have to change anything it's just

4002.88 --> 4006.4
that

4003.839 --> 4007.2799999999997
we've been handed the view on how to

4006.4 --> 4011.6800000000003
look on it

4007.28 --> 4011.6800000000003
and respond to it that's the priestly

4018.839 --> 4021.839
trick

4051.599 --> 4055.28
all right well yeah george stanford

4053.28 --> 4056.4
that's that's your prerogative if you

4055.28 --> 4060.079
don't want that

4056.4 --> 4063.28
fine i do

4060.079 --> 4068.7200000000003
see it as a challenge

4063.28 --> 4071.3590000000004
and i really do recognize that

4068.72 --> 4073.359
everything that's been kind of good in

4071.359 --> 4076.64
my development that has actually

4073.359 --> 4079.359
yielded growth is all

4076.64 --> 4081.359
based on making the right choices based

4079.359 --> 4085.5989999999997
on the guiding pathway

4081.359 --> 4088.319
example of christ right

4085.599 --> 4089.3590000000004
the actions the choices that he presents

4088.319 --> 4094.5589999999997
that you wouldn't even

4089.359 --> 4094.5589999999997
see if it wasn't for him

4099.52 --> 4104.319
has yielded a lot in my personal

4102.839 --> 4107.2789999999995
development

4104.319 --> 4109.279
even if i didn't read the bible well

4107.279 --> 4110.400000000001
every time somebody spoke about jesus i

4109.279 --> 4115.6
would always listen

4110.4 --> 4117.5199999999995
like is that jesus is that really him

4115.6 --> 4119.839
or somebody just saying something about

4117.52 --> 4122.88
him

4119.839 --> 4132.719
because you can hear it by his words

4122.88 --> 4147.839
the words

4132.719 --> 4147.839
man it's cooking here

4158.839 --> 4161.839
foreign

4166.88 --> 4172.400000000001
there's no use like george sanford is

4169.199 --> 4176.48
never going to be convinced to

4172.4 --> 4180.239
be part of the he is just like

4176.48 --> 4182.799
pretty much anti

4180.239 --> 4184.799
always has been he still has reasonable

4182.799 --> 4186.239
input sometimes but don't push him

4184.799 --> 4189.759
because he'll just get

4186.239 --> 4194.639999999999
really annoying okay trust me

4189.759 --> 4194.64
know this by experience just leave it

4195.199 --> 4205.5199999999995
it's just gonna go into denial spirals

4202.08 --> 4206.719
in many ways he understands the value

4205.52 --> 4210.4800000000005
that is there

4206.719 --> 4213.84
it's just he latches on to the failures

4210.48 --> 4215.599999999999
to claim that means it's all invalid

4213.84 --> 4218.4800000000005
right that's his problem and that's the

4215.6 --> 4221.120000000001
typical atheist response

4218.48 --> 4222.4
recognize the value but because it's not

4221.12 --> 4225.76
absolutely perfect

4222.4 --> 4228.879999999999
nothing in existence is

4225.76 --> 4231.280000000001
it can't be right

4228.88 --> 4232.96
that's what he does that's what a lot of

4231.28 --> 4235.5199999999995
people do it's what i used to do

4232.96 --> 4235.52
way back

4238.0 --> 4245.84
i know better now

4263.52 --> 4274.56
take it easy drunk on both four one one

4272.08 --> 4275.6
worry you're still a joy to have around

4274.56 --> 4279.120000000001
the jet

4275.6 --> 4279.120000000001
just take it easy you know

4279.679 --> 4282.96
i'm more concerned about your health

4281.52 --> 4285.360000000001
than your

4282.96 --> 4287.84
supposed heckling behavior it's not that

4285.36 --> 4287.839999999999
bad

4294.4 --> 4302.879999999999
right have a good night drunk a bullet

4298.96 --> 4302.88
don't forget to drink plenty of water

4310.0 --> 4317.76
sheesh it's freaking out here crazy

4315.84 --> 4321.04
it's gonna be this hot tomorrow then i'm

4317.76 --> 4321.04
probably gonna be shirtless

4325.76 --> 4331.52
okay not an atheist fine fine whatever

4329.04 --> 4331.5199999999995
theist

4332.56 --> 4343.84
not atheist your whatever theist sure

4345.199 --> 4350.719
non-biblical theist okay is that a good

4348.159 --> 4357.839999999999
way to describe you

4350.719 --> 4357.84
let's just drop this man

4365.36 --> 4371.36
so is everybody just dropping not

4367.92 --> 4374.56
getting in here

4371.36 --> 4377.839999999999
not responding anymore because

4374.56 --> 4380.080000000001
you don't accept this are you all

4377.84 --> 4381.360000000001
against what i do are you all just

4380.08 --> 4384.48
adamant

4381.36 --> 4387.5199999999995
i would like to see you vote in chat

4384.48 --> 4390.799999999999
you think this is wrong that i

4387.52 --> 4393.6
draw into question the idea that christ

4390.8 --> 4395.84
would have died as some slaughter

4393.6 --> 4399.1990000000005
sacrifice

4395.84 --> 4402.719
to set things straight somehow

4399.199 --> 4405.36
while god himself says that well well

4402.719 --> 4406.64
jesus himself says that sacrifice is not

4405.36 --> 4408.88
done

4406.64 --> 4410.88
that is old ways that should be

4408.88 --> 4413.84
abandoned

4410.88 --> 4415.76
is that unacceptable that i do that did

4413.84 --> 4418.4800000000005
i draw that into question does that

4415.76 --> 4419.280000000001
risk me for going to hell i would like

4418.48 --> 4421.12
to know

4419.28 --> 4426.639999999999
after all this i would like to hear from

4421.12 --> 4432.64
you in chat to say it

4426.64 --> 4432.64
come out this is a test for you

4437.44 --> 4441.839999999999
i want to know what you've learned

4443.21 --> 4446.399
[Music]

4448.0 --> 4453.199
if you agree with me show a thumbs up or

4450.8 --> 4455.84
something and if you don't agree

4453.199 --> 4455.839999999999
thumbs down

4456.88 --> 4469.84
i'm not talking about like the the show

4459.6 --> 4469.84
i'm talking in the chat

4480.84 --> 4483.84
what

4491.12 --> 4494.4
okay cameron kamikaze gilmore but now

4493.6 --> 4496.400000000001
you're still

4494.4 --> 4498.159
trying to slip in the presupposition

4496.4 --> 4501.599999999999
anyway

4498.159 --> 4505.12
right why would he have to die

4501.6 --> 4508.56
to reset the equilibrium point of energy

4505.12 --> 4511.92
isn't his arrival and him

4508.56 --> 4514.88
carrying out the message to a final

4511.92 --> 4516.08
official point where he visibly died to

4514.88 --> 4518.0
people

4516.08 --> 4519.44
they were all convinced he was dead

4518.0 --> 4522.719
isn't that

4519.44 --> 4525.678999999999
the reset of the energy

4522.719 --> 4526.8
why would he actually physically have to

4525.679 --> 4530.0
absolutely be

4526.8 --> 4532.400000000001
dead and then later come back to life

4530.0 --> 4533.92
why would that be required specifically

4532.4 --> 4536.4
to reset

4533.92 --> 4539.84
the equilibrium point of energy as you

4536.4 --> 4539.839999999999
say it

4557.28 --> 4560.32
okay clutch bear

4561.679 --> 4565.52
i basically just repeated the core

4563.92 --> 4567.6
essence of it

4565.52 --> 4569.1990000000005
i really appreciate your input and if

4567.6 --> 4581.84
you all not

4569.199 --> 4581.839999999999
just start getting evasive

4585.44 --> 4592.159
drunken bullet go already this is

4588.8 --> 4609.84
bye turn

4592.159 --> 4609.839999999999
off the screen and get some sleep

4611.44 --> 4615.12
oh you agree with me clutch bear

4615.44 --> 4626.0
right so you feel the same about it

4623.28 --> 4626.88
right and i'm not denying the suffering

4626.0 --> 4630.08
he took

4626.88 --> 4632.96
right he was as good as that

4630.08 --> 4633.84
or he was dead right because i don't

4632.96 --> 4636.8
know for sure

4633.84 --> 4638.0
i'm just open to alternative

4636.8 --> 4641.1990000000005
considerations

4638.0 --> 4644.48
why would he have to die if he was just

4641.199 --> 4646.159
like dead by any human standards like

4644.48 --> 4647.44
everybody is convinced like well if you

4646.159 --> 4650.5599999999995
get that

4647.44 --> 4652.4
spear piercing [ __ ]

4650.56 --> 4654.2390000000005
and all that and all the pain yeah

4652.4 --> 4655.44
you're going to be dead right he's

4654.239 --> 4658.48
stopped breathing

4655.44 --> 4661.28
he's dead right well maybe he isn't

4658.48 --> 4663.44
just human maybe he is god and so he

4661.28 --> 4666.5599999999995
would be able to

4663.44 --> 4669.599999999999
actually live out of that

4666.56 --> 4672.56
because it was supernatural right

4669.6 --> 4674.4800000000005
and yeah it's really not that different

4672.56 --> 4676.8
from the idea of a resurrection

4674.48 --> 4677.599999999999
it's just another angle of approach to

4676.8 --> 4679.84
it

4677.6 --> 4682.56
make it more physiological and less

4679.84 --> 4682.56
external

4683.36 --> 4690.839999999999
right i'm attributing more power

4686.88 --> 4693.84
to jesus with this

4690.84 --> 4693.84
idea

4702.0 --> 4706.08
all right kamikaze cameron kamikaze

4704.4 --> 4710.4
gilmore that's okay because

4706.08 --> 4713.92
it is dude i am literally

4710.4 --> 4718.08
going to a huge arc way of a

4713.92 --> 4722.0
massive world religion taking the crown

4718.08 --> 4724.5599999999995
jewel the crown jewel

4722.0 --> 4725.679
and then saying there's something wrong

4724.56 --> 4729.4400000000005
with this

4725.679 --> 4732.88
yeah it's super arrogant technically

4729.44 --> 4734.5599999999995
but i have to by oath i'm a freaking

4732.88 --> 4738.32
paladin

4734.56 --> 4741.360000000001
yes i am drawing like the core

4738.32 --> 4749.679
jewel of the priesthood into doubt

4741.36 --> 4753.44
i am i'm testing it

4749.679 --> 4755.679
because i can and i want to i want to do

4753.44 --> 4755.678999999999
that

4756.64 --> 4759.76
and i have to do it

4761.36 --> 4766.08
but yes dude when a spell that has been

4764.719 --> 4769.199
that old

4766.08 --> 4771.28
and that widely spread among people so

4769.199 --> 4773.919999999999
many people caught up in that spell

4771.28 --> 4775.84
and chanting it for a generation upon

4773.92 --> 4777.52
generation upon generation

4775.84 --> 4779.76
yeah that's going to cause a whole lot

4777.52 --> 4781.4400000000005
of confusion when somebody then

4779.76 --> 4784.56
somewhere suddenly says

4781.44 --> 4786.719
uh wait

4784.56 --> 4789.360000000001
there's something wrong with this why

4786.719 --> 4792.4800000000005
have we all been believing this for like

4789.36 --> 4793.839999999999
1000 years when it actually doesn't make

4792.48 --> 4796.32
any sense

4793.84 --> 4797.04
right yeah it's going to confuse people

4796.32 --> 4800.159
it is

4797.04 --> 4803.36
it should because i am testing a

4800.159 --> 4807.44
major what i believe to be a major

4803.36 --> 4810.239
spell the biggest ones right the trinity

4807.44 --> 4812.799999999999
is also one of these but this one is

4810.239 --> 4814.48
basically the capstone

4812.8 --> 4819.84
of the whole thing of the whole

4814.48 --> 4819.839999999999
priesthood of their trickery as i see it

4819.92 --> 4825.76
and i deduce that by logical reasoning

4823.44 --> 4830.5599999999995
and cross-reference of the laws

4825.76 --> 4830.56
of god taking it all extremely serious

4830.84 --> 4835.28
okay

4833.04 --> 4836.32
so yeah i'm just asking people to

4835.28 --> 4839.44
consider it

4836.32 --> 4842.719
that is all and

4839.44 --> 4845.678999999999
beware of triggered responses

4842.719 --> 4847.04
beware of your need to chant something

4845.679 --> 4848.88
to reinforce it

4847.04 --> 4851.36
do you actually understand what you're

4848.88 --> 4852.32
chanting does it make perfect sense to

4851.36 --> 4855.599999999999
you

4852.32 --> 4861.84
can you perfectly defend that

4855.6 --> 4861.84
through logic and the rules of god

4878.88 --> 4882.96
yeah that's right george sanford that's

4883.679 --> 4886.719
what's legal negative it's not just that

4886.32 --> 4888.88
not

4886.719 --> 4891.12
everything but yeah a whole bunch of

4888.88 --> 4891.12
things

4891.199 --> 4903.839999999999
a significant portion yes and they make

4894.32 --> 4903.84
people dwell for a very long time

4914.159 --> 4920.638999999999
hmm getting [ __ ] loads of feedback

4916.8 --> 4920.639
cameron coming as a guild ward oh that's

4928.84 --> 4931.84
good

4933.28 --> 4936.719
right anybody else would like to

4939.44 --> 4959.839999999999
give their response anything from

4944.48 --> 4959.839999999999
sonian gohan

4967.04 --> 4969.679
he dropped

4970.159 --> 4973.839999999999
still got 28 watching

4977.44 --> 4983.678999999999
maybe a lot of you are just now

4980.8 --> 4984.56
going through bible pages trying to find

4983.679 --> 5001.84
some clues

4984.56 --> 5001.84
as to how to respond i don't know

5026.239 --> 5032.0
okay if i'm not getting any responses in

5028.239 --> 5032.0
two minutes i'm gonna round out the show

5035.52 --> 5042.320000000001
get some groceries even before flat

5037.52 --> 5044.96
earth debate starts

5042.32 --> 5045.5199999999995
because i think i made it may have worn

5044.96 --> 5048.4
you all

5045.52 --> 5048.400000000001
out with this

5048.88 --> 5055.679
right i'm very well aware that is kind

5051.44 --> 5059.839999999999
of effectively creating a rift now again

5055.679 --> 5070.96
but i'm only doing it to try to

5059.84 --> 5072.96
heal right try to uncensor

5070.96 --> 5074.0
getting people to chance something

5072.96 --> 5077.6
effectively

5074.0 --> 5079.36
is getting them to self-censor

5077.6 --> 5081.1990000000005
because you cannot say anything that

5079.36 --> 5085.28
would oppose the chant

5081.199 --> 5089.5199999999995
right i'm against that

5085.28 --> 5092.0
anything that is true can be tested

5089.52 --> 5093.120000000001
right just like the scientific method

5092.0 --> 5096.88
it's logic

5093.12 --> 5099.84
logos anything that is true

5096.88 --> 5099.84
can be tested

5102.719 --> 5108.88
hey tiny wumbo all right you just saved

5106.48 --> 5108.879999999999
the show

5109.159 --> 5113.839999999999
drunkenbullet411 dude

5114.0 --> 5116.239
don't

5122.56 --> 5127.84
go to bed buddy

5152.84 --> 5155.84
so

5163.679 --> 5169.84
anyone seen star wars yet no not today

5183.76 --> 5186.400000000001
oh [ __ ]

5190.639 --> 5194.0
sorry i'm laughing about something else

5192.719 --> 5197.84
neil

5194.0 --> 5197.84
has some domestic issues

5204.32 --> 5211.84
nothing nothing really dark or anything

5208.84 --> 5211.84
but

5223.199 --> 5229.12
okay george sanford that's nice

5226.719 --> 5231.679
and that's interesting but that is

5229.12 --> 5235.599999999999
gnostic though that is

5231.679 --> 5237.52
jesus yes in a mechanical sense

5235.6 --> 5239.84
there is something about jesus and the

5237.52 --> 5244.400000000001
son there really is but it's

5239.84 --> 5246.96
that doesn't exclude

5244.4 --> 5249.679
the actual living person story from

5246.96 --> 5249.679
being real

5250.84 --> 5256.0
okay

5252.639 --> 5260.639
right so this is where i come in i say

5256.0 --> 5263.84
both are true because any interpretation

5260.639 --> 5265.52
anybody looking upon the bible

5263.84 --> 5267.679
laying out an exact path of

5265.52 --> 5271.360000000001
interpretation and then saying

5267.679 --> 5274.8
this this is the only route thou

5271.36 --> 5278.08
shalt take if one wishes to reach

5274.8 --> 5282.719
the gates of heaven right

5278.08 --> 5284.88
that's immediately wrong in my opinion

5282.719 --> 5285.76
immediately because i think that the

5284.88 --> 5289.04
bible

5285.76 --> 5290.2390000000005
can be interpreted in any conceivable

5289.04 --> 5292.239
way

5290.239 --> 5294.638999999999
literally whatever you bring to it you

5292.239 --> 5297.04
can get out of it and it's all

5294.639 --> 5297.04
true

5300.32 --> 5305.28
all the ways work all the information is

5303.36 --> 5306.48
there the structures are there it's all

5305.28 --> 5309.84
true

5306.48 --> 5309.839999999999
it doesn't exclude

5309.92 --> 5313.1990000000005
there from being

5313.6 --> 5323.52
specific careful misinterpretations

5319.52 --> 5326.719
right that also exists

5323.52 --> 5329.280000000001
but that's man reading it

5326.719 --> 5331.52
and then thinking how can i make people

5329.28 --> 5337.84
misunderstand this so they don't

5331.52 --> 5337.84
completely understand the full insight

5345.84 --> 5349.28
oh religions persona no that's just the

5348.639 --> 5351.4800000000005
that's

5349.28 --> 5355.44
one part of it george sanford that's not

5351.48 --> 5355.44
exclusively the only thing

5355.52 --> 5365.84
that's just wrong you're being agnostic

5358.239 --> 5365.839999999999
is wrong

5377.76 --> 5381.92
well john 925 hello

5382.08 --> 5385.6
wiggles i don't know i don't even

5384.0 --> 5387.6
remember i don't know what he's like

5385.6 --> 5388.400000000001
right now i think he's been kind of like

5387.6 --> 5392.4800000000005
a

5388.4 --> 5395.5199999999995
just a bit of a ball or a bit of a troll

5392.48 --> 5398.159
i don't remember it's been a long time

5395.52 --> 5400.96
since i've seen him

5398.159 --> 5407.839999999999
or like been directly in a conversation

5400.96 --> 5407.84
where he was talking

5414.719 --> 5420.32
all right uh george sanford that's

5417.76 --> 5423.04
really repulsive way to put it

5420.32 --> 5423.599999999999
we're not all harry potters it's a

5423.04 --> 5427.36
really

5423.6 --> 5427.360000000001
freaking annoying thing to say

5428.719 --> 5431.92
and it works right yeah i know it works

5430.88 --> 5434.639
yeah it all works

5431.92 --> 5435.6
i know i just confirmed that it works

5434.639 --> 5438.2390000000005
that doesn't mean

5435.6 --> 5439.6
it's the only thing about it that works

5438.239 --> 5441.839999999999
why don't you listen

5439.6 --> 5446.4800000000005
to what i have to say i've been saying

5441.84 --> 5449.84
this specifically to you george sanford

5446.48 --> 5449.839999999999
for over a year

5450.239 --> 5453.44
every time i tell it every time i say

5452.639 --> 5456.08
it's like yeah

5453.44 --> 5458.5599999999995
you can look at it that way it works

5456.08 --> 5461.639
it's not the only way that works

5458.56 --> 5465.92
there is more every

5461.639 --> 5469.04
interpretation of the bible

5465.92 --> 5471.04
that demands that you exclude all other

5469.04 --> 5473.92
things from being legitimate

5471.04 --> 5473.92
is wrong

5475.44 --> 5479.839999999999
right if you want to hold on to that

5478.0 --> 5483.12
specific interpretation yeah

5479.84 --> 5484.719
sure do it if it worked for you do that

5483.12 --> 5486.32
but as soon as you're going to say the

5484.719 --> 5489.04
other things are wrong

5486.32 --> 5491.84
then you're wrong you're being ignorant

5489.04 --> 5491.84
that's all

5504.719 --> 5507.92
what have you been saying well why don't

5506.719 --> 5509.84
you listen

5507.92 --> 5511.1990000000005
to what i have been saying in the last

5509.84 --> 5514.56
year i told it i've

5511.199 --> 5518.08
literally said it now like four

5514.56 --> 5521.679
times right now i've

5518.08 --> 5523.76
said it four times george sanford

5521.679 --> 5526.56
and i've said it probably hundreds of

5523.76 --> 5526.56
times by now

5526.88 --> 5532.04
or a hundred times something like that

5528.8 --> 5534.88
i've said it many many many times

5532.04 --> 5537.84
multi-dimensional book in the bible

5534.88 --> 5539.84
many interpretations all of them write

5537.84 --> 5543.12
even though they seem

5539.84 --> 5547.84
seem to conflict

5543.12 --> 5547.84
different stories and they're all true

5549.12 --> 5552.8
but you gotta see the story for what it

5551.44 --> 5556.08
is separately and not

5552.8 --> 5559.4400000000005
based on what priests tell

5556.08 --> 5563.6
you about how to interpret

5559.44 --> 5563.599999999999
it understand

5565.52 --> 5570.400000000001
please don't make me repeat this a fifth

5568.08 --> 5570.4
time

5571.52 --> 5576.2390000000005
or i mean the sixth time this was the

5573.6 --> 5576.2390000000005
fifth time

5578.48 --> 5589.839999999999
oh god i have george sanford

5581.84 --> 5589.84
i have

5600.84 --> 5603.84
so

5659.92 --> 5673.84
okay that's it then

5684.84 --> 5687.84
um

5692.56 --> 5698.56
steamy traveler you bastard why couldn't

5694.96 --> 5698.56
you come here like an hour ago

5699.84 --> 5703.360000000001
don't be that late again

5704.719 --> 5709.84
what you talking about well

5708.239 --> 5711.839999999999
it kind of seems like the entire

5709.84 --> 5714.2390000000005
hangouts bled to death

5711.84 --> 5715.4400000000005
after i i challenged everybody to

5714.239 --> 5718.718999999999
consider again

5715.44 --> 5721.839999999999
my ideas about jesus perhaps not

5718.719 --> 5725.28
dying laid it out in

5721.84 --> 5728.0
really careful detail

5725.28 --> 5729.599999999999
and i got a whole bunch of priestly

5728.0 --> 5743.84
chanting

5729.6 --> 5743.84
and now dead silence

5748.0 --> 5751.36
the only really george sanford even

5750.239 --> 5754.839999999999
getting into it

5751.36 --> 5756.5599999999995
but that's because he's kind of like a

5754.84 --> 5759.679
total

5756.56 --> 5762.639
bible rejectionist except for the uh

5759.679 --> 5763.1990000000005
the gnostic interpretation it seems

5762.639 --> 5766.88
that's just

5763.199 --> 5771.119
like really disappointed guys i thought

5766.88 --> 5775.119
you would be able to

5771.119 --> 5775.119
respond a little more to this

5775.199 --> 5780.0
but more to say than just chanting

5778.159 --> 5784.239
things

5780.0 --> 5785.92
kind of disappointed in you guys well

5784.239 --> 5799.839999999999
not steamy traveler but just

5785.92 --> 5799.84
you just arrived

5805.28 --> 5808.4
okay steam traveler

5809.199 --> 5812.96
oh dude if anybody would like to leave

5811.679 --> 5815.119
like a comment

5812.96 --> 5816.56
in retrospect maybe everybody just

5815.119 --> 5820.08
really needs to let

5816.56 --> 5823.119000000001
everything i said sink a lot let it sink

5820.08 --> 5824.84
a lot in order to be able to bypass and

5823.119 --> 5828.0
calm down the chanting

5824.84 --> 5829.1990000000005
responses in order to really think about

5828.0 --> 5831.119
it and then maybe

5829.199 --> 5833.28
write a carefully written comment if you

5831.119 --> 5836.639
feel like it i would appreciate an

5833.28 --> 5838.8
actual response instead of just

5836.639 --> 5841.04
the appearance where that people kind of

5838.8 --> 5842.159000000001
like turn my their back to me and stop

5841.04 --> 5843.679
talking

5842.159 --> 5846.96
it's like the feeling that i'm getting

5843.679 --> 5846.96
here from some

5852.8 --> 5858.4800000000005
i was not gentle okay clutch bear

5856.4 --> 5859.5199999999995
you kind of arrived a little late as

5858.48 --> 5863.44
well so

5859.52 --> 5863.4400000000005
i think yeah

5865.119 --> 5871.199
the show's already been going for over

5868.0 --> 5871.199
one half hour so

5873.04 --> 5879.36
way too introverted okay that's fine

5876.719 --> 5883.84
then camera cause a good word

5879.36 --> 5883.839999999999
you just got here right

5884.96 --> 5888.96
well i'm kind of drained now i think i'm

5887.28 --> 5891.84
gonna round out the show early

5888.96 --> 5893.76
just get some you know my bike get some

5891.84 --> 5897.84
groceries try to get back

5893.76 --> 5897.84
for the fed live show

5902.159 --> 5906.638999999999
but yeah talking i talked a lot about

5905.36 --> 5909.04
this

5906.639 --> 5910.56
i thought i really put down myself very

5909.04 --> 5913.76
clearly

5910.56 --> 5914.8
so yes it is definitely worth watching

5913.76 --> 5916.639
this

5914.8 --> 5918.639
if you just came in late it is worth

5916.639 --> 5920.639
watching it i think and consider it

5918.639 --> 5923.52
carefully

5920.639 --> 5925.84
please try not to be offended i really

5923.52 --> 5927.84
don't mean to offend it's just that i

5925.84 --> 5931.1990000000005
see a problem and i

5927.84 --> 5936.08
it's my duty if i see it

5931.199 --> 5939.839999999999
and it's really hard to attain to try it

5936.08 --> 5939.84
feel like a must

5940.4 --> 5944.879999999999
anyway i'm rounding out the show thanks

5943.44 --> 5948.08
everyone for coming

5944.88 --> 5952.8
even the late commerce it's okay

5948.08 --> 5956.32
if you'd still like this show

5952.8 --> 5958.320000000001
right broken it up if you can

5956.32 --> 5960.639
if you're still here i would appreciate

5958.32 --> 5962.96
that and if you didn't like it then

5960.639 --> 5967.119
rogan sit down that's fine

5962.96 --> 5968.639
right that's your religious duty to do

5967.119 --> 5971.04
that

5968.639 --> 5973.679
because of the ball or because of the

5971.04 --> 5975.44
the priestly code

5973.679 --> 5977.84
handed to you about concerning

5975.44 --> 5980.159
christianity and how to interpret it

5977.84 --> 5982.400000000001
then yeah do that you know there's

5980.159 --> 5985.599999999999
nothing i can do about it

5982.4 --> 5986.5599999999995
but i urge you all watch this to

5985.6 --> 5988.4800000000005
consider

5986.56 --> 5990.56
the things that i've said just consider

5988.48 --> 5993.759999999999
