I've noticed there's more wind than

121.979 --> 127.259
yesterday

123.42 --> 130.099
and I'm thinking about it it feels less

127.259 --> 130.099
moist as well

132.48 --> 139.01999999999998
because really icky sticky yesterday

136.02 --> 139.02
right

141.959 --> 149.52
hello Oz first in chat good to see you

145.14 --> 152.05999999999997
that flat fellow slo-mo moonwagi

149.52 --> 156.66
it is Saturday the

152.06 --> 156.66
25th of August 2023

160.099 --> 164.04
let's check the temperature

162.2 --> 166.44
[Music]

164.04 --> 169.04
21 degrees

166.44 --> 169.04
right

170.34 --> 174.54
so

172.92 --> 176.57999999999998
yeah

174.54 --> 182.06
oh now they're forecasting even more

176.58 --> 182.06
rain so oh whatever we'll see we'll see

187.68 --> 193.68
it won't be long for 2000 well

194.78 --> 201.36
I mean

197.84 --> 204.0
2000 is going to be

201.36 --> 208.86
in the

204.0 --> 208.86
middle or early summer 2024.

208.92 --> 212.35999999999999
if everything goes well

214.14 --> 218.54
so yeah I guess a year is not that long

219.18 --> 225.15
it's all a matter of perspective though

222.48 --> 228.439
no Brown Swanson

[Music]

249.78 --> 256.139
I've seen that picture being used before

253.56 --> 258.0
anyway right so yeah how are you guys

256.139 --> 260.34000000000003
all doing

258.0 --> 262.68
I'm a little knackered because yesterday

260.34 --> 265.979
was just such a

262.68 --> 268.979
freaking long fed day

265.979 --> 268.979
uh

269.16 --> 274.699
went past nine

271.56 --> 274.699
that was just crazy

275.46 --> 280.25899999999996
so I'm kind of glad I'm not doing any

278.34 --> 281.69899999999996
fed today and there's not going to be

280.259 --> 283.259
ball busters

281.699 --> 287.18
so

283.259 --> 287.18
could just like leave it for a bit

288.54 --> 291.66
I think it was like six hours or

290.759 --> 293.40000000000003
something

291.66 --> 295.38000000000005
yesterday

293.4 --> 297.17999999999995
all together

295.38 --> 299.15999999999997
you know I don't know you have to be

297.18 --> 301.68
like a member

299.16 --> 306.91900000000004
Nathan Oakley 1980 to have seen it all

301.68 --> 306.919
because after some point he just started

307.74 --> 315.08
members only live streams

310.8 --> 315.08
hey LSG good to see you

317.22 --> 322.699
please

318.78 --> 322.69899999999996
total eclipse okay

323.759 --> 326.3
hmm

336.6 --> 340.68
I would like to say oh wow that's so

338.52 --> 342.9
rare but I mean

340.68 --> 344.28000000000003
aren't there basically just eclipses

342.9 --> 347.28
everywhere

344.28 --> 350.65999999999997
like on a yearly basis and they're all

347.28 --> 350.65999999999997
kind of unique or something but

354.78 --> 361.5
or not so unique I'm just like I'm not

358.8 --> 363.72
even that interested anymore it was very

361.5 --> 365.58
interesting to like study as a light

363.72 --> 368.03900000000004
phenomenon right

365.58 --> 369.21
so yeah maybe in that sense it can be

368.039 --> 372.40999999999997
interesting LSG

369.21 --> 372.40999999999997
[Music]

372.479 --> 377.58
I always thought it was like quite

374.28 --> 379.19899999999996
astounding to see like the shadow of

377.58 --> 381.85999999999996
eclipse

379.199 --> 381.86
light

382.8 --> 389.699
like show the same patterns

386.34 --> 393.9
like the light itself was just Eclipse

389.699 --> 397.639
shaped very surreal

393.9 --> 397.63899999999995
hey lumpy gas and a vacuum

400.74 --> 403.819
Dr utker

407.3 --> 417.68
uh strong suspicion Ron Swanson air is

412.56 --> 417.68
control or Sean Hawkins but whatever

421.08 --> 425.0
it just seems to be goofing around

426.72 --> 431.72
right so yeah I don't really have a

428.88 --> 431.71999999999997
direct subject

431.88 --> 437.419
except for well what I've been talking

433.74 --> 437.419
about hey Supreme knowing

443.34 --> 450.13899999999995
oh yeah I got a Bonus cat

446.28 --> 450.13899999999995
don't know if you can can you see him

450.78 --> 456.539
he's

452.16 --> 459.319
he's like right there right behind me

456.539 --> 459.31899999999996
is here

462.18 --> 465.44
spot the kitty

465.9 --> 469.099
okay can you see him

480.9 --> 487.34
you can't see him can you is it Pure

484.38 --> 487.34
White yes

491.099 --> 494.4
let me let me show you this is gonna be

493.56 --> 498.539
funny

494.4 --> 501.12
keep a very close eye on the on the

498.539 --> 503.58
blanket because he's she's lying right

501.12 --> 506.4
on it

503.58 --> 509.78
yeah camera Kitty so keep and take a

506.4 --> 509.78
look at my screen and just look

511.68 --> 514.58
with them

554.76 --> 562.3389999999999
yeah oh yeah that that happens

558.6 --> 562.339
but it's hilarious isn't it

567.12 --> 574.14
sorry yeah now I woke her up

569.76 --> 576.779
it's a uh Schrodinger scatter Factor

574.14 --> 579.899
knowing which path like once you show

576.779 --> 582.32
the kitty then it moves away right

579.899 --> 582.32
uh

583.68 --> 589.04
oh wait no it's just getting back all

586.86 --> 589.04
right

597.18 --> 601.279
hey Bill Nye the science denier

602.459 --> 609.4399999999999
how long ago did you get the cat

605.1 --> 609.44
well it's not really my cat

611.279 --> 614.8389999999999
she's just decided

614.94 --> 621.86
to be my cat

618.06 --> 621.8599999999999
I don't know exactly whose it is

622.56 --> 627.42
wow she's like exactly in the corner

625.62 --> 629.839
right next to my shoulder this is

627.42 --> 629.8389999999999
amazing

642.899 --> 649.16
right so it's not my cat I don't

645.0 --> 649.16
actually have a name for her but

649.38 --> 654.3
yeah it's just we're just she's we're

651.72 --> 657.98
just having a cat man relation thing

654.3 --> 657.9799999999999
going hey B

662.6 --> 666.0790000000001
the safety

671.399 --> 675.899
low B

673.98 --> 679.8000000000001
second

675.899 --> 683.779
here there you go oh wow

679.8 --> 683.779
I didn't even have to maneuver

684.6 --> 690.14
basically showed the BV exit and went

687.6 --> 690.14
right away

691.92 --> 697.9399999999999
wow cat kitty is completely invisible

694.8 --> 697.9399999999999
again see

699.12 --> 703.44
she's lying right there but you just

701.459 --> 705.06
can't see it like I can't even see it

703.44 --> 707.899
looking at the screen

705.06 --> 707.899
it's hilarious

709.56 --> 712.279
anyway

716.22 --> 719.12
hello Sam

724.14 --> 730.019
huh Sama is an actual subscribers wow

727.92 --> 732.56
it's a real person

730.019 --> 732.5600000000001
huh

733.14 --> 738.5
can't win

734.82 --> 738.5
I've always been a cat guy

739.8 --> 743.3
I grew up with cats

744.839 --> 749.4590000000001
when I was younger

747.06 --> 753.42
I wasn't like all the best with dogs

749.459 --> 755.579
because I had like nervousness issues

753.42 --> 758.24
I mean I'm perfectly fine with dogs now

755.579 --> 762.0
like I'm not afraid of dogs

758.24 --> 764.94
like not even big ones well unless like

762.0 --> 767.519
they look like they're particularly

764.94 --> 771.0600000000001
vicious

767.519 --> 774.48
like dogs can have a vicious spirit

771.06 --> 776.76
but I mean I know that the same goes

774.48 --> 779.4200000000001
with people like I recognize that at a

776.76 --> 779.42
distance so

780.3 --> 784.639
like wild dogs are like vicious

786.12 --> 788.9590000000001
but uh

793.98 --> 797.66
amazing animal yeah they are

802.2 --> 810.0790000000001
I never had a white cat by the way I

804.72 --> 810.0790000000001
always had like Cyprus and weird mixes

813.839 --> 817.7600000000001
and like big red males

825.66 --> 831.06
I love watching them hunt yeah yes she

829.019 --> 834.0600000000001
actually this white one actually caught

831.06 --> 837.18
a uh a mole

834.06 --> 842.8199999999999
and brought it like downstairs put it in

837.18 --> 842.8199999999999
the doorway so like like here's my catch

843.12 --> 848.1
which is very interesting

845.76 --> 851.54
because that that's another sign that

848.1 --> 851.5400000000001
she's basically adopted me

855.0 --> 860.16
actually quite interested to see because

857.519 --> 863.339
moles do kind of ruin the grass down

860.16 --> 865.26
there so in that sense it's cool and if

863.339 --> 867.5400000000001
she's that kind of a hunter well then I

865.26 --> 869.579
really like to have around because well

867.54 --> 873.62
we do

869.579 --> 873.62
periodically have mice here

875.279 --> 882.42
so this is just another magical

879.44 --> 883.9200000000001
win-win given by God it's just like yeah

882.42 --> 887.279
it's a cat

883.92 --> 890.0999999999999
cat likes me I like the cat cats kind of

887.279 --> 892.019
the cats very much like my old cat a

890.1 --> 894.6
little bit more aggressive my my old cat

892.019 --> 897.24
was like completely non-aggression like

894.6 --> 900.48
zero was kind of weird like that because

897.24 --> 902.5790000000001
he was like never aggressive

900.48 --> 907.6800000000001
she would be defensive against other cat

902.579 --> 910.1389999999999
but like never aggressive to people or

907.68 --> 914.459
or non-prey she was aggressive against

910.139 --> 914.4590000000001
like birds and mice

915.56 --> 924.0189999999999
because we like chose in the family like

919.26 --> 924.019
our cats are allowed to hunt

924.54 --> 931.38
but then if certain birds like Nestle

927.839 --> 934.2790000000001
then we do kind of like try to

931.38 --> 934.279
protect them

937.92 --> 944.639
like yeah it got complicated sometimes

942.8 --> 947.76
[Music]

944.639 --> 950.4590000000001
we prefer that the the cats didn't go

947.76 --> 953.399
after Birds but after mice

950.459 --> 955.26
mostly because in our old house which

953.399 --> 958.019
was kind of very old out it was like

955.26 --> 960.18
over 100 years old used to be a farm

958.019 --> 962.4590000000001
and there were definitely mice there

960.18 --> 964.26
they would always kept coming back so we

962.459 --> 966.0
would just always had cats we like we

964.26 --> 968.519
had to have cats or the mice would

966.0 --> 970.18
literally be running in the hallways

968.519 --> 972.36
so

970.18 --> 974.9399999999999
[Music]

972.36 --> 979.26
currently

974.94 --> 981.98
making Heaven bringing myself at night

979.26 --> 984.42
crunching ah

981.98 --> 987.6
yeah that

984.42 --> 990.139
yeah well most cats don't actually eat

987.6 --> 990.139
the mice

992.88 --> 1000.5
I mean a lot of cats like don't learn to

996.24 --> 1002.839
hunt to eat by their parents

1000.5 --> 1004.699
because they get taken from the nest

1002.839 --> 1006.98
before any kind of actual education

1004.699 --> 1009.38
starts happening

1006.98 --> 1012.019
but then they just end up instinctually

1009.38 --> 1013.88
playing with it until they kill it it's

1012.019 --> 1015.86
not meant for it's actually meant for

1013.88 --> 1017.54
sports but their instincts are still

1015.86 --> 1019.6990000000001
telling them to do things so they're

1017.54 --> 1021.3199999999999
like sort of hunting but they don't

1019.699 --> 1024.26
really know what they're doing

1021.32 --> 1026.9
right my cat actually learned how to

1024.26 --> 1029.36
hunt and she would know how to

1026.9 --> 1031.8190000000002
she even learned like careful Butchery

1029.36 --> 1034.2199999999998
from my from her mother

1031.819 --> 1037.24
just bizarre kind of creepy but it's

1034.22 --> 1037.24
like she would like

1037.939 --> 1043.8190000000002
always leave specific organs behind like

1040.939 --> 1047.24
completely untouched so somehow she knew

1043.819 --> 1049.52
how to like surgically like with a small

1047.24 --> 1050.96
mice like remove I think it was the

1049.52 --> 1053.12
liver or something

1050.96 --> 1055.72
she would always do that very

1053.12 --> 1055.7199999999998
fascinating

1059.12 --> 1064.6999999999998
yeah but freaky though it is it is

1062.66 --> 1066.98
[ __ ] gross I mean I've seen my old

1064.7 --> 1070.3400000000001
cat like chewing on a mouse too and it's

1066.98 --> 1073.0
like oh God uh just I just don't want to

1070.34 --> 1073.0
see it sorry

1077.419 --> 1083.0800000000002
right

1079.64 --> 1083.0800000000002
mostly moles though

1085.76 --> 1088.299
anyway

1096.98 --> 1102.44
we feed him more right

1100.1 --> 1104.7199999999998
yeah but this cat's gonna like probably

1102.44 --> 1107.78
do it anyway because she's like

1104.72 --> 1109.82
hyperactive she's that type she's like

1107.78 --> 1112.3999999999999
one of those really Slinky super

1109.82 --> 1114.4399999999998
flexible but slightly aggressive and

1112.4 --> 1116.96
hyperactive types

1114.44 --> 1119.179
actually since she's like sort of

1116.96 --> 1121.28
falling in love with with me and that's

1119.179 --> 1123.14
kind of what I describe it like

1121.28 --> 1125.6
she's been like calmer than I've ever

1123.14 --> 1127.76
seen that cat

1125.6 --> 1130.6999999999998
because she's always just like Restless

1127.76 --> 1132.44
moving around and now she's like just

1130.7 --> 1135.98
regularly just sitting there sleeping

1132.44 --> 1139.1000000000001
and I pet her and she goes back

1135.98 --> 1141.14
when like a year ago she would never do

1139.1 --> 1143.12
that never

1141.14 --> 1145.3400000000001
so it's kind of weird to see like there

1143.12 --> 1147.62
has been some kind of social chemistry

1145.34 --> 1150.32
happening that's why I say like she fell

1147.62 --> 1151.58
in love with me because hey I am a

1150.32 --> 1155.8999999999999
Charming dude

1151.58 --> 1158.4189999999999
and I I I'm very I got hand skills you

1155.9 --> 1162.02
know so

1158.419 --> 1164.679
she's like whoa this this guy knows how

1162.02 --> 1164.679
to pets

1165.919 --> 1168.7
ah

1173.96 --> 1176.679
anyway

1181.22 --> 1187.28
right but I'm also finally because I

1184.52 --> 1190.58
just do that I'm sort of playing with

1187.28 --> 1193.1
conditioning with the food because I am

1190.58 --> 1196.3999999999999
using the food like as a reward system

1193.1 --> 1199.1599999999999
and I'm basically seeing like

1196.4 --> 1201.679
because she will like just become

1199.16 --> 1204.8600000000001
patient when I kind of signal to her

1201.679 --> 1207.3200000000002
like no no you maybe later

1204.86 --> 1209.6
not now

1207.32 --> 1212.78
you already got it like I do like talk

1209.6 --> 1215.6
to her and I do like talk with

1212.78 --> 1216.98
that type of communication and she gets

1215.6 --> 1219.32
it

1216.98 --> 1221.66
so now she's basically like sort of

1219.32 --> 1223.52
presenting her service she's like being

1221.66 --> 1227.78
serviceable pity

1223.52 --> 1230.179
like Charming beautiful patient

1227.78 --> 1234.26
and so I thought

1230.179 --> 1236.7800000000002
yeah well maybe maybe I could train her

1234.26 --> 1240.7
just through communication to just be my

1236.78 --> 1240.7
background Kitty for the show

1241.28 --> 1246.799
maybe get some investment out of all

1243.44 --> 1248.8400000000001
that cat food not that I spent that much

1246.799 --> 1250.76
on it but still

1248.84 --> 1255.4599999999998
no no no

1250.76 --> 1255.46
it's not isn't that funny how that works

1256.46 --> 1262.88
right I don't need a contract

1259.82 --> 1265.3999999999999
I don't need ownership I just need to

1262.88 --> 1267.6200000000001
communicate with Kitty and then

1265.4 --> 1269.179
I can just time it so that you'll become

1267.62 --> 1273.1
my background Kitty for the show

1269.179 --> 1276.44
although yeah I mean background

1273.1 --> 1278.6
you can't actually see her sitting there

1276.44 --> 1279.98
because she's white

1278.6 --> 1282.1399999999999
uh

1279.98 --> 1285.22
but I've I've delivered proof though

1282.14 --> 1285.22
that she is there

1291.5 --> 1299.32
I will be far away from the Sun devoort

1294.679 --> 1302.48
now zont Ford

1299.32 --> 1307.48
uh the beach

1302.48 --> 1307.48
I think that's like 20 to 30 kilometers

1313.46 --> 1320.059
but I mean it's kind of windy so and 21

1316.159 --> 1322.3400000000001
degrees I mean it's not like Ideal Beach

1320.059 --> 1324.559
weather unless you want to like do

1322.34 --> 1328.3999999999999
walking at the beach with with wind and

1324.559 --> 1330.76
all that can be very refreshing

1328.4 --> 1332.7800000000002
foreign

1330.76 --> 1335.48
against like

1332.78 --> 1337.52
flu did you know that

1335.48 --> 1339.8600000000001
walking at the beach getting that all

1337.52 --> 1342.9189999999999
that beachy air

1339.86 --> 1345.86
like even when it's not warm is pretty

1342.919 --> 1350.9
good for your lungs

1345.86 --> 1354.52
or at least that's what my parents said

1350.9 --> 1354.52
and it did feel like that

1357.98 --> 1362.659
I haven't actually been to a beach in a

1360.74 --> 1364.3700000000001
long time now

1362.659 --> 1367.65
I kind of miss it

1408.86 --> 1412.4799999999998
but I know it's sitting there

1425.78 --> 1431.1399999999999
right anyhow let's let's talk about

1433.94 --> 1440.0
Flat Earth yesterday's episode

1436.88 --> 1442.3400000000001
kind of disappointed a bit that I didn't

1440.0 --> 1445.0
get any comments on it other than some

1442.34 --> 1445.0
gamma troll

1447.44 --> 1451.299
yesterday show was actually really good

1454.22 --> 1457.059

1481.52 --> 1484.299
foreign

1489.88 --> 1493.419
the ginger guy

1493.82 --> 1498.82
the soul is so

1497.12 --> 1501.6789999999999
and all that

1498.82 --> 1504.32
yeah I want Benjamin's like really going

1501.679 --> 1506.9
on about about him I have no idea but I

1504.32 --> 1509.78
like I mean I'm like I'm in total

1506.9 --> 1511.3400000000001
agreeance with that because that pissed

1509.78 --> 1515.1789999999999
me off

1511.34 --> 1518.78
two like about America

1515.179 --> 1521.96
does damn whiny Cowboys

1518.78 --> 1525.559
it's like oh Little Beard

1521.96 --> 1527.96
I'm depressed and I'm gonna drink like

1525.559 --> 1530.6
this just like you suck like I thought

1527.96 --> 1533.72
always like that part I thought like you

1530.6 --> 1537.08
suck if you're into that you suck it's

1533.72 --> 1539.84
like sorry no mercy

1537.08 --> 1542.559
that sucks it just sucks if you like

1539.84 --> 1542.559
that you suck

1542.659 --> 1548.179
now I like uplifting

1545.48 --> 1550.82
country type songs I re and I I

1548.179 --> 1554.659
genuinely like that it like it like

1550.82 --> 1557.12
makes me move like I have to like

1554.659 --> 1560.8600000000001
it really cheers me up like it's one of

1557.12 --> 1560.86
the things that for example

1561.02 --> 1567.3799999999999
Firefly the series remember

1564.74 --> 1569.72
it was a lot of that they and they had

1567.38 --> 1573.1000000000001
like genuine like happy country songs

1569.72 --> 1578.299
and she and like oh I love that like oh

1573.1 --> 1583.6
but those whiny depressed Cowboys like

1578.299 --> 1583.6
[ __ ] you dude [ __ ] you you're a loser

1585.34 --> 1590.539
laughs

1587.38 --> 1592.159
so I'm totally on with the own Benjamin

1590.539 --> 1594.2
there

1592.159 --> 1596.5390000000002
I mean I just never really pay attention

1594.2 --> 1599.0
to those guys

1596.539 --> 1601.22
like I don't even want to like complain

1599.0 --> 1603.7
about him because it's like just let it

1601.22 --> 1603.7
fizzle

1607.22 --> 1612.32
do you like a bluegrass gospel what what

1610.94 --> 1616.46
is that

1612.32 --> 1616.46
moon rover 666.

1622.46 --> 1625.48
a little bit

1630.2 --> 1632.98
foreign

1634.94 --> 1641.9
yeah and by the way when I say Cowboys I

1638.72 --> 1644.299
that's kind of a European slang if you

1641.9 --> 1646.4
don't get I know that actual Cowboys are

1644.299 --> 1648.52
usually they're not fat because you have

1646.4 --> 1651.919
to be [ __ ] strong and you have to be

1648.52 --> 1654.559
focused and [ __ ] Cowboy is actually a

1651.919 --> 1658.159
very tough profession

1654.559 --> 1659.96
I just mean dudes with hats that talk

1658.159 --> 1663.5590000000002
like this

1659.96 --> 1667.58
and then do country like that's just a

1663.559 --> 1670.8999999999999
cowboy It's Over generalization

1667.58 --> 1670.8999999999999
right anyway

1679.4 --> 1687.279
Cowboys ain't fat it's not gonna work or

1683.179 --> 1687.279
you're not gonna be fat for long then

1689.059 --> 1692.6
unless you keep eating [ __ ] and then

1691.159 --> 1696.14
you'll just die

1692.6 --> 1696.1399999999999
anyway uh

1701.299 --> 1706.84
so yeah not really knowing what you're

1703.039 --> 1706.84
talking about there moon rover

1710.12 --> 1714.6789999999999
what I could carry on for a minute or

1713.48 --> 1720.32
two

1714.679 --> 1722.0
well I could if I'd be obliged to

1720.32 --> 1725.4189999999999
but

1722.0 --> 1729.76
I don't know I don't really have that

1725.419 --> 1729.76
elaborate of a neck killer

1730.46 --> 1735.74
I'll just end up like using complicated

1733.1 --> 1737.9599999999998
words that Cowboys typically don't and I

1735.74 --> 1740.419
don't know the bypasses

1737.96 --> 1743.659
I only know the bypasses through sheer

1740.419 --> 1745.279
exposure like enacted movies and all

1743.659 --> 1747.8600000000001
that

1745.279 --> 1752.02
I don't know any actual living Cowboy

1747.86 --> 1752.02
talking people around all the time

1753.2 --> 1760.779
so I don't have the complete vernacular

1755.84 --> 1760.779
of typical hard word bypasses

1764.779 --> 1770.72
I I say the hard words like I've been

1768.02 --> 1772.82
personally trained to like never go away

1770.72 --> 1775.88
from hard words

1772.82 --> 1779.779
to always just like oh out of trouble

1775.88 --> 1782.6000000000001
pronouncing it okay well that means you

1779.779 --> 1787.24
have to pronounce it until you are like

1782.6 --> 1787.24
the best pronunciator in the world

1788.919 --> 1794.48
like I don't shy like that's the one

1792.32 --> 1797.4189999999999
thing about americanism that's just like

1794.48 --> 1799.82
no that part that that part I'm much

1797.419 --> 1803.419
more British

1799.82 --> 1806.059
it's just that my accent tends to go

1803.419 --> 1807.919
much more into the direction of a

1806.059 --> 1811.12
American

1807.919 --> 1811.1200000000001
than British

1811.399 --> 1817.6399999999999
because the British inflections are all

1815.12 --> 1819.08
quite different

1817.64 --> 1822.0800000000002
and

1819.08 --> 1823.76
with those inflections also the mindset

1822.08 --> 1827.98
Alters

1823.76 --> 1827.98
and that's just awkward

1829.88 --> 1833.38
so I just talk like this

1834.02 --> 1838.8799999999999
I originally started talking like actual

1837.08 --> 1840.86
English accented

1838.88 --> 1845.179
I even took it

1840.86 --> 1848.3799999999999
down to a poor me talk you know

1845.179 --> 1851.3600000000001
like I did it all like all the accents

1848.38 --> 1853.3400000000001
I convinced a little when I was a little

1851.36 --> 1854.7199999999998
kid there was a little British kid on

1853.34 --> 1857.12
the beach

1854.72 --> 1860.0
it could clearly hear it was like really

1857.12 --> 1863.36
really British

1860.0 --> 1867.2
and I just started talking British back

1863.36 --> 1869.9599999999998
and then they asked me like what

1867.2 --> 1871.94
like what city did I live in Britain

1869.96 --> 1873.74
because they were that convinced that I

1871.94 --> 1877.96
was British and they had to explain that

1873.74 --> 1880.94
no I'm actually not British I'm Dutch

1877.96 --> 1884.779
I'll never remember oh I never forget

1880.94 --> 1887.419
that oh I'm so special so special I'm

1884.779 --> 1890.12
like six or eight and I convinced the

1887.419 --> 1893.38
British kid that it was actually British

1890.12 --> 1893.3799999999999
hell yeah

1893.779 --> 1897.94
let's say what do you want from me

1901.46 --> 1907.3400000000001
[Music]

1903.62 --> 1909.1399999999999
but I mean I was always like a mimicker

1907.34 --> 1909.98
that that's what I was doing all day

1909.14 --> 1913.88
long

1909.98 --> 1915.98
doing Little Voices doing accents

1913.88 --> 1918.7990000000002
copying

1915.98 --> 1921.2
lines from movies

1918.799 --> 1923.779
because that does kind of like make you

1921.2 --> 1925.76
popular a little people do think it's

1923.779 --> 1927.799
cool

1925.76 --> 1929.72
when you do it right

1927.799 --> 1931.8799999999999
and then they try to do it and then they

1929.72 --> 1933.2
don't do it exactly right and then I do

1931.88 --> 1934.8200000000002
it and I do it perfectly and they're

1933.2 --> 1937.52
like wow

1934.82 --> 1938.779
right let's get stuff

1937.52 --> 1942.76
it

1938.779 --> 1942.76
it uh it did work

1944.539 --> 1950.299
at least until like teen teenage and

1948.38 --> 1952.3990000000001
then like yeah that didn't really work

1950.299 --> 1955.299
anymore

1952.399 --> 1955.299
but uh

1964.039 --> 1968.98
gospel is country songs about God

1970.88 --> 1973.419
okay

1974.12 --> 1978.1399999999999
Brian dip should have the chat yeah they

1976.7 --> 1981.74
did

1978.14 --> 1984.5590000000002
it was live on D Rose Channel but oh my

1981.74 --> 1985.58
God that his chat is like has all the

1984.559 --> 1989.86
trolls

1985.58 --> 1989.86
yeah was [ __ ] gross

1992.84 --> 1998.4399999999998
and to be fair it was a [ __ ] annoying

1995.419 --> 1998.44
thing to sit through

1998.6 --> 2005.32
Brian was doing his best but he had the

2001.72 --> 2008.799
typical Brian effect I'm just gonna call

2005.32 --> 2013.08
it de bruyne effect it's where

2008.799 --> 2013.08
he will just keep trying to talk

2013.72 --> 2019.779
but then it becomes like kind of robotic

2017.14 --> 2022.179
and with it was just like [ __ ]

2019.779 --> 2024.94
rumpusing all over it and just ad homing

2022.179 --> 2027.159
him and like ah like what the hell man

2024.94 --> 2030.64
that just

2027.159 --> 2033.279
it became like a cluster screw it was It

2030.64 --> 2038.019
was kind of annoying

2033.279 --> 2042.0
Brian basically didn't he wasn't able to

2038.019 --> 2042.0
actually exert Authority

2043.12 --> 2049.839

gentlemanly towards like very ungently

2049.839 --> 2053.619
Behavior

2051.22 --> 2056.1389999999997
and and yeah because he just kept trying

2053.619 --> 2057.82
to kept consistent and because of that

2056.139 --> 2061.9190000000003
it just became a mess and the moderator

2057.82 --> 2061.9190000000003

2063.04 --> 2067.5

2120.94 --> 2124.2000000000003
over saturated

2124.24 --> 2131.0789999999997
the debates being freaking six hours

2262.18 --> 2266.8199999999997
okay no eight Refugee eight kittens

2280.599 --> 2287.52
right

2283.26 --> 2287.5200000000004
he's still sitting there

2287.68 --> 2290.94
I'm seeing it better

2291.64 --> 2295.2
it's just that the light

2295.9 --> 2300.76
from outside is just like completely

2299.079 --> 2302.8
drowning it out

2300.76 --> 2304.8390000000004
thank you

2302.8 --> 2307.3590000000004
it's not even that bright but it's just

2304.839 --> 2309.46
like the camera so maybe if you can

2307.359 --> 2312.48
see if you can just weird it

2309.46 --> 2312.48
'll see it better now

2314.26 --> 2317.5200000000004
it's a little better right

2317.8 --> 2323.28
you can see the contrast better on the

2320.5 --> 2323.28
blanket

2325.0 --> 2331.98
I mean you can almost this yeah see a

2328.96 --> 2331.98
shape now almost

2341.44 --> 2343.98
okay

2350.74 --> 2356.5
I mean I think it's kind of funny it's

2353.44 --> 2359.26
like Yay guys I got a new thing I got a

2356.5 --> 2362.859
cat on the show

2359.26 --> 2364.599
the one problem you just can't see but

2362.859 --> 2367.0789999999997
he's there on the screen you just can't

2364.599 --> 2367.079
see it

2367.24 --> 2374.3799999999997
I'm sorry I just think it I'm just

2370.359 --> 2376.98
thinking it's funny it's kind of weird

2374.38 --> 2376.98
foreign

2387.52 --> 2391.859
maybe it's the invisible cat

2393.099 --> 2398.6400000000003
from Alice in Wonderland

2395.98 --> 2398.64
yeah

2402.94 --> 2406.56
I haven't thought of that before

2409.839 --> 2413.98
like

2411.76 --> 2416.26
what yeah

2413.98 --> 2419.38
invisible cat from Alice and what what

2416.26 --> 2422.4
if they actually didn't literally become

2419.38 --> 2422.4
invisible just

2423.54 --> 2429.96
it's very good at picking spots in which

2427.119 --> 2429.96
to blend in

2437.68 --> 2440.3999999999996
whatever

2448.72 --> 2454.6189999999997
right so guys yeah what can I talk about

2451.66 --> 2454.6189999999997
uh

2456.18 --> 2461.16
I knew today was kind of going to be a

2458.68 --> 2461.16
blank day

2461.2 --> 2464.98
because it was all a bit too late and it

2463.78 --> 2467.4
was just

2464.98 --> 2467.4
tired

2468.96 --> 2474.48
I did have a good dinner though I

2471.4 --> 2474.48
finally got that chicken

2475.78 --> 2480.8390000000004
definitely welcome immediately noticing

2478.78 --> 2484.0
that the

2480.839 --> 2487.48
apparent or thought of as potential

2484.0 --> 2490.079
arthritis also literally like that

2487.48 --> 2490.079
decreases

2491.14 --> 2496.5989999999997
so it seems like an overall condition

2493.839 --> 2500.38
thing and it's really like what

2496.599 --> 2503.32
how is my moral State and what

2500.38 --> 2507.1600000000003
substances am I getting in my body to

2503.32 --> 2510.28
literally countermand the whole

2507.16 --> 2512.98
set of symptoms that just come with the

2510.28 --> 2515.619
with slow degrading

2512.98 --> 2517.66
so that's how it works

2515.619 --> 2520.54
and by that standard you can also

2517.66 --> 2523.66
already estimate like what are you

2520.54 --> 2527.56
unfortunately gonna end up with

2523.66 --> 2530.5
and to be fair if it's just this

2527.56 --> 2533.2
it's not going to be that bad until I

2530.5 --> 2535.78
get like in a bad condition spot because

2533.2 --> 2538.359
then probably I'll gonna have issues

2535.78 --> 2540.52
with my shoulder and my jaw

2538.359 --> 2544.359
so those are the parts

2540.52 --> 2546.88
that are like the weakness factors

2544.359 --> 2550.5989999999997
that's those are like the alarms of like

2546.88 --> 2554.04
hey condition regressing

2550.599 --> 2554.04
then that comes up

2554.68 --> 2559.06
so yeah

2556.56 --> 2560.2
I'm basically using everything that's

2559.06 --> 2562.839
happened

2560.2 --> 2565.359
thinking about it and then using that to

2562.839 --> 2567.339
size up where I'm going so that I can

2565.359 --> 2572.16
anticipate and become more efficient

2567.339 --> 2572.16
with how I'm gonna become

2576.16 --> 2578.5789999999997
right

2584.56 --> 2588.88
and hey everybody gets problems when

2587.2 --> 2592.56
they get when they become older physical

2588.88 --> 2592.56
problems to some degree

2592.72 --> 2596.4599999999996
sometimes it comes suddenly

2596.5 --> 2601.3
most of the times it's slowly slowly

2599.02 --> 2603.7
slowly builds up and you're just like

2601.3 --> 2606.3390000000004
it's not even a problem until like oh

2603.7 --> 2608.2
and now it's a problem oh it goes away

2606.339 --> 2610.06
and then you forget about it and then at

2608.2 --> 2611.74
some point it's just ah it seems to make

2610.06 --> 2615.04
a problem and then

2611.74 --> 2617.2599999999998
it takes a little longer to go away

2615.04 --> 2618.88
it's not then you forget about it though

2617.26 --> 2621.28
because it goes away again and then it

2618.88 --> 2623.1400000000003
comes back and then suddenly

2621.28 --> 2625.2400000000002
like it's not that bad but then it

2623.14 --> 2628.3799999999997
doesn't go away

2625.24 --> 2628.3799999999997
like what is this

2630.64 --> 2635.3799999999997
and then eventually it can get really

2632.98 --> 2637.66
bad and you're just glad it's gonna be

2635.38 --> 2640.3
not that bad again

2637.66 --> 2643.66
and then eventually you'll learn to

2640.3 --> 2647.8590000000004
literally live efficiently with that

2643.66 --> 2652.319
it's just that bad now it's just entropy

2647.859 --> 2652.319
right you know if you know about entropy

2652.359 --> 2658.119
and you really understand it then you

2654.88 --> 2659.44
should take that into account in

2658.119 --> 2663.4
modeling

2659.44 --> 2667.98
yourself throughout time honestly

2663.4 --> 2667.98
empirically based on what's Happening

2669.64 --> 2675.04
right

2672.0 --> 2677.319
was finishing a Soup Sandwich cool did

2675.04 --> 2679.5
you actually try it out Cuisine wise I

2677.319 --> 2679.5
mean

2679.72 --> 2683.2799999999997
I'm sure it's doable

2687.339 --> 2692.14
right

2689.14 --> 2694.9
yeah that was funny I almost forgot but

2692.14 --> 2696.5789999999997
yesterday on the last

2694.9 --> 2698.92
uh

2696.579 --> 2702.3390000000004
the last part of the show

2698.92 --> 2705.16
before Nathan actually quit

2702.339 --> 2707.98
I was discussing with the guys about how

2705.16 --> 2709.66
soup sandwiches are actually real that

2707.98 --> 2712.2400000000002
that can be real

2709.66 --> 2714.7
and it rolled out like a real debate I

2712.24 --> 2717.52
mean that was like live improvised

2714.7 --> 2719.4399999999996
comedy genius

2717.52 --> 2721.78
it was

2719.44 --> 2724.7200000000003
and the funny thing was I kept pushing

2721.78 --> 2728.079
it and you all kept going along with the

2724.72 --> 2732.04
joke and I'm like thank you so freaking

2728.079 --> 2734.26
much that's the [ __ ] that I try to do

2732.04 --> 2737.02
but most of the times guys you guys are

2734.26 --> 2738.88
not up for it and then somebody ruins it

2737.02 --> 2741.52
like Neil or something but even he

2738.88 --> 2743.92
didn't do that he wasn't even there

2741.52 --> 2745.9
so it was just really funny

2743.92 --> 2750.46
thank you

2745.9 --> 2753.46
was it recorded yeah it was live Adam it

2750.46 --> 2756.18
was live on a on a members only stream

2753.46 --> 2756.18
didn't you know

2767.14 --> 2771.7
you know what I can actually link you to

2769.54 --> 2775.2
that so if you have memberships over at

2771.7 --> 2775.2
Nathan Oakley Nike the 80 then

2775.8 --> 2780.099
let's see where is it

2778.44 --> 2781.2400000000002
[Music]

2780.099 --> 2783.96
yeah

2781.24 --> 2783.9599999999996
that's it

2787.48 --> 2790.26
what is it

2792.819 --> 2794.819
um

2796.839 --> 2799.7999999999997
this is it right

2801.4 --> 2806.319
[Music]

2803.74 --> 2808.8999999999996
I think this is it

2806.319 --> 2811.599
is it only one and a half hour I'm

2808.9 --> 2814.06
surprised now I'm not entirely sure

2811.599 --> 2817.1400000000003
whether it was actually playing it I

2814.06 --> 2817.14
thought it was playing live

2819.339 --> 2823.0789999999997
it was just testing

2823.66 --> 2830.16
I'm not sure anymore I was seeing

2826.78 --> 2830.1600000000003
something playing live

2830.74 --> 2835.54
while we were talking like that

2833.02 --> 2837.7599999999998
recording hadn't ended

2835.54 --> 2840.579
I mean Nathan

2837.76 --> 2841.6600000000003
like had to restart his computer then he

2840.579 --> 2844.1800000000003
came back

2841.66 --> 2847.42
then he also started the new members

2844.18 --> 2850.5
only stream or restarted the same

2847.42 --> 2850.5
started to back up

2857.02 --> 2861.88
I just remembered that while was making

2859.0 --> 2865.18
this joke I was checking with the chat

2861.88 --> 2868.1800000000003
that was still live

2865.18 --> 2870.22
so uh I don't know man that's what

2868.18 --> 2872.319
happens when you do freaking six hours

2870.22 --> 2877.02
until

2872.319 --> 2877.02
past nine nine pm

2878.26 --> 2884.88
okay that means like I've been busy for

2881.8 --> 2884.88
like eight hours

2894.48 --> 2901.619
people telling me to get a job well I'm

2897.94 --> 2901.619
literally working for eight hours

2906.16 --> 2910.2
but it was it was interesting though

2914.8 --> 2916.8590000000004
yeah

2917.44 --> 2920.28
right anyway

2921.7 --> 2928.839
Soup Sandwich yeah because

2925.96 --> 2931.18
Quantum eraser always says that oh it's

2928.839 --> 2933.7
like proving a Soup Sandwich

2931.18 --> 2935.74
yeah but I thought like no no you can

2933.7 --> 2937.98
have a Soup Sandwich you just can't have

2935.74 --> 2937.9799999999996
a

2938.4 --> 2944.92
a Soup Sandwich

2941.2 --> 2949.06
you can't have a sandwich that is

2944.92 --> 2951.04
a sandwich with soup

2949.06 --> 2954.099
like in between the sandwich that

2951.04 --> 2955.839
doesn't work because yeah it's not gonna

2954.099 --> 2957.579
be able to contain it right it's gonna

2955.839 --> 2961.619
go through the red

2957.579 --> 2961.619
but you can have a Soup Sandwich

2962.079 --> 2968.7400000000002
right which means a sandwich that is

2965.98 --> 2971.38
designated for soup

2968.74 --> 2972.819
how would it be designated well like a

2971.38 --> 2974.92
soup bowl

2972.819 --> 2977.44
right it's a Soup Sandwich it's a

2974.92 --> 2978.46
sandwich that's actually shaped like a

2977.44 --> 2981.28
bowl

2978.46 --> 2982.68
to have soup in it now the filling isn't

2981.28 --> 2986.76
soup

2982.68 --> 2986.7599999999998
but it's still a Soup Sandwich

2994.06 --> 2998.74
on the nature of sandwiches yes and the

2996.4 --> 3002.339
difference between uh like what defines

2998.74 --> 3004.859
a hot dog right so according to my

3002.339 --> 3008.2799999999997
insights and this this sounds silly but

3004.859 --> 3010.74
it might actually be legal in life like

3008.28 --> 3013.5
people probably had court cases over

3010.74 --> 3016.5
this nonsense because of trademark

3013.5 --> 3018.3
licensing and brand names that shit's

3016.5 --> 3020.099
happened in the past okay

3018.3 --> 3021.54
so I think there's a good chance that

3020.099 --> 3024.96
like

3021.54 --> 3027.0
you can only call a hot dog

3024.96 --> 3028.7400000000002
the bread with the sausage you can only

3027.0 --> 3030.48
call it that

3028.74 --> 3033.5989999999997
if it is

3030.48 --> 3035.76
not a cut sausage like as soon as you

3033.599 --> 3038.52
cut the sausage whether it's like

3035.76 --> 3041.2200000000003
straight through or in pieces then it's

3038.52 --> 3044.18
no longer a hot dog like it has to be an

3041.22 --> 3044.18
intact sausage

3044.52 --> 3048.119
otherwise you're not allowed to call it

3046.5 --> 3051.059
a hot dog

3048.119 --> 3054.839
then it's just a sandwich sandwich can

3051.059 --> 3057.6600000000003
be a piece of red two pieces of red

3054.839 --> 3060.18
with anything within it but if it's a

3057.66 --> 3063.74
sausage then you attain the legal right

3060.18 --> 3063.74
to call it a hot dog

3064.68 --> 3069.72
because that's like a a brand right it's

3067.74 --> 3071.339
like oh a hot dog you know exactly what

3069.72 --> 3075.2
you're gonna get you're gonna get an

3071.339 --> 3075.2
intact sausage in a bun

3075.359 --> 3081.839
right not two slices of bread with a

3079.44 --> 3084.54
bunch of sausage slices it in between it

3081.839 --> 3086.46
that's a sandwich

3084.54 --> 3088.38
now when you like hear hot dog

3086.46 --> 3091.02
immediately what do you think

3088.38 --> 3094.079
sausage bread that's what you think

3091.02 --> 3096.24
because that's what a hot dog is right

3094.079 --> 3097.8590000000004
well we had one and a half hour debate

3096.24 --> 3101.72
about that yesterday

3097.859 --> 3101.72
with the guys and it was amazing

3105.92 --> 3111.48
misrepresenting sandwich again no no no

3108.24 --> 3113.4599999999996
no it was somebody actually Wikipedia

3111.48 --> 3115.5
searched it Adam

3113.46 --> 3118.14
I'm sorry

3115.5 --> 3121.04
the sandwich is basically two flat

3118.14 --> 3121.04
slices of bread

3121.26 --> 3125.3590000000004
with a filling in between

3127.02 --> 3133.079
somebody looked it up

3129.599 --> 3134.52
now you can have these single slice type

3133.079 --> 3136.26
sandwich

3134.52 --> 3137.7599999999998
but that's not actually a sandwich

3136.26 --> 3141.7200000000003
that's just

3137.76 --> 3141.7200000000003
bread with covering

3143.819 --> 3148.2
in Netherlands we call that

3145.859 --> 3151.22
um just

3148.2 --> 3151.22
just bread

3155.76 --> 3161.059
has to be double

3157.5 --> 3161.059
otherwise it isn't a sandwich

3161.579 --> 3169.28
right anyway hello Rew report

3166.02 --> 3169.28
woodworking gummy bear

3172.98 --> 3177.68
Soup Sandwich is a reference to an

3175.14 --> 3177.68
operation

3177.78 --> 3182.8190000000004
that completely Falls that's

3180.18 --> 3184.7999999999997
well that seems logical enough with

3182.819 --> 3187.2799999999997
working on your mirror

3184.8 --> 3191.6400000000003
foreign

3187.28 --> 3194.52
is is that it is actually doable

3191.64 --> 3196.339
I mean it's not easy like oh anybody can

3194.52 --> 3198.24
make no you're gonna have to be like

3196.339 --> 3199.74
engineering I mean if you're gonna make

3198.24 --> 3202.5
a Soup Sandwich you're gonna have to

3199.74 --> 3205.02
make the sandwich in a way that it is

3202.5 --> 3208.559
actually a able

3205.02 --> 3210.619
to contain soup for longer than like

3208.559 --> 3214.079
five seconds

3210.619 --> 3216.42
you have to be able to scoop the soup

3214.079 --> 3218.819
out of the sandwich until it's done

3216.42 --> 3221.7000000000003
without the whole thing just falling

3218.819 --> 3223.98
apart and getting all over you otherwise

3221.7 --> 3225.8999999999996
it isn't a successful Soup Sandwich it

3223.98 --> 3228.42
has to be able to contain the soup and

3225.9 --> 3230.88
then still be edible like a sandwich

3228.42 --> 3233.339
or simultaneously right that you can

3230.88 --> 3234.48
literally drink the soup from it and

3233.339 --> 3237.66
take a bite

3234.48 --> 3240.059
from The Soup Sandwich cup

3237.66 --> 3242.2799999999997
that is the sandwich so you can like

3240.059 --> 3243.6600000000003
drink and take a little bite at the same

3242.28 --> 3247.26
time

3243.66 --> 3250.5589999999997
so it will require some careful food

3247.26 --> 3253.0200000000004
engineering but it is doable

3250.559 --> 3254.8190000000004
so yeah but the whole hangout yesterday

3253.02 --> 3260.119
was basically

3254.819 --> 3260.119
uh pastrami it was all pastrami talk

3260.94 --> 3266.54
yeah that's pastronomy that's the naming

3264.059 --> 3266.5400000000004
of bread

3268.26 --> 3275.96
so fanatical Bakers typically have

3272.54 --> 3275.96
pastrami knowledge

3277.98 --> 3283.079
right right otherwise they wouldn't be

3280.079 --> 3285.48
able to distinguish different breads

3283.079 --> 3288.48
so you have to have astronomy and it has

3285.48 --> 3291.059
to be a standard and the pastronomers

3288.48 --> 3293.059
they are the ones that determine what

3291.059 --> 3296.2200000000003
breads

3293.059 --> 3298.6400000000003
are legally able to be named in certain

3296.22 --> 3298.64
ways

3300.119 --> 3306.6800000000003
right otherwise you have like copyright

3302.94 --> 3306.68
violations and all that

3306.96 --> 3312.359
like if people call just a sandwich with

3309.72 --> 3315.66
some slices of sausage and then as a hot

3312.359 --> 3316.859
dog false advertisement

3315.66 --> 3321.66
right

3316.859 --> 3321.66
according to pastrami law

3322.26 --> 3329.6400000000003
the sausage has to be intact

3326.099 --> 3334.6400000000003
in order for the product to be able to

3329.64 --> 3334.64
legally attain the name hot dog

3339.54 --> 3344.579
right so now you got a an indication as

3342.54 --> 3346.619
to what that one and a half hour

3344.579 --> 3348.0
conversation was like yesterday with the

3346.619 --> 3350.839
guys on fed

3348.0 --> 3353.819
pretty amazing

3350.839 --> 3356.7799999999997
I love how passionately everybody got

3353.819 --> 3356.7799999999997
involved with it too

3361.859 --> 3368.04
astronomy sounds like the study of

3364.14 --> 3372.359
pastry shaped stars and yeah no it isn't

3368.04 --> 3375.96
is pastoral like pastries

3372.359 --> 3377.54
no me name naming it's the naming of

3375.96 --> 3382.079
pastries

3377.54 --> 3385.079
onomi isn't stars and shapes yeah

3382.079 --> 3388.559
that's Esther

3385.079 --> 3391.099
Esther is the Stars indicate that's like

3388.559 --> 3394.619
the sky the stuff in the sky

3391.099 --> 3396.8
astronomy the naming of the stuff in the

3394.619 --> 3396.8
sky

3397.559 --> 3405.6600000000003
anomi or Nomi is just naming

3402.54 --> 3408.079
so pastrami is the the naming of

3405.66 --> 3408.0789999999997
pastries

3409.98 --> 3415.04
or also known as bread lore

3419.64 --> 3424.02
right this can all be read this you

3421.92 --> 3427.76
could literally Define this in Dungeons

3424.02 --> 3427.7599999999998
and Dragons if you want

3428.64 --> 3433.7999999999997
you could have specialized Baker

3431.16 --> 3436.2
characters you can make that in dungeon

3433.8 --> 3439.8590000000004
dragons if you like where there is a

3436.2 --> 3442.9399999999996
pastronomy and even like magical bread

3439.859 --> 3442.94
making and

3443.819 --> 3449.16
and you have like you can turn dungeon

3446.819 --> 3451.44
dragons into a Commerce system too

3449.16 --> 3454.5589999999997
because it does account for that

3451.44 --> 3456.9
you have professions to make money in

3454.559 --> 3459.42
public you can turn it into an economy

3456.9 --> 3462.48
game I mean wouldn't be very interesting

3459.42 --> 3464.76
for an adventure setting based game but

3462.48 --> 3468.619
you can do that

3464.76 --> 3468.619
that's what it's so amazing about it

3468.66 --> 3471.5589999999997
right anyway

3476.7 --> 3480.02
put that in the title

3480.96 --> 3483.5
foreign

3488.49 --> 3493.7599999999998
[Applause]

3501.3 --> 3505.8590000000004
so

3502.68 --> 3509.04
now the show is called spot the cat and

3505.859 --> 3511.7599999999998
the pestronomy debates

3509.04 --> 3511.7599999999998
for now

3513.359 --> 3516.859
grabblers and the dragons

3517.559 --> 3523.02
Dungeons and Dragons yeah hey it's just

3520.44 --> 3527.18
what it's called originally I mean my

3523.02 --> 3527.18
version I call it trolls and tyrants

3528.24 --> 3534.5989999999997
which I thought was very was going to be

3531.9 --> 3537.6600000000003
because I thought the name up

3534.599 --> 3541.319
in 2000

3537.66 --> 3543.54
12 or 13. I'm not sure somewhere that

3541.319 --> 3544.94
was it

3543.54 --> 3548.42
yeah

3544.94 --> 3548.42
2012 I think

3556.2 --> 3559.5
I thought it was actually a really good

3558.0 --> 3561.68
designation because we're dealing with

3559.5 --> 3561.68
that

3562.14 --> 3565.5
right I mean

3563.76 --> 3568.5
yeah there's Dungeons and there's

3565.5 --> 3570.18
dragons metaphorically and literally end

3568.5 --> 3572.7
metaphorically

3570.18 --> 3574.6189999999997
but

3572.7 --> 3577.2599999999998
the dungeons being literal and the

3574.619 --> 3579.78
dragons being metaphorical

3577.26 --> 3582.059
but I mean the water what does this

3579.78 --> 3584.28
world now why what is the struggle in

3582.059 --> 3585.8390000000004
the world what are we struggling with

3584.28 --> 3588.92
trolls

3585.839 --> 3588.92
and tyrants

3589.859 --> 3594.14
against one another with one another

3600.72 --> 3605.16
right

3602.579 --> 3607.619
that's why I called

3605.16 --> 3610.22
my Dungeons and Dragons

3607.619 --> 3610.2200000000003
version

3610.319 --> 3613.339
trolls and tyrants

3617.88 --> 3623.28
and also because the short now would be

3620.04 --> 3626.04
TNT and I thought that was funny

3623.28 --> 3628.76
thought that was kind of explosive

3626.04 --> 3628.7599999999998
foreign

3650.96 --> 3655.859
you don't seem to get Dungeons and

3653.46 --> 3657.66
Dragons at all woodworking anywhere the

3655.859 --> 3660.0589999999997
point is

3657.66 --> 3661.94
the same two letters so if you're going

3660.059 --> 3666.3590000000004
to use Grabbers you can't use dragons

3661.94 --> 3670.339
but you can call it ghouls yeah you

3666.359 --> 3670.339
could call it Ghouls and Grabbers

3670.74 --> 3674.359
ghosts would be kind of lame

3674.76 --> 3682.38
but ghouls emphasize the ghoulishness

3678.72 --> 3685.74
right so yeah you could make a Dungeons

3682.38 --> 3689.2200000000003
and Dragons versions version

3685.74 --> 3692.8799999999997
and call it Ghouls and Grabbers you can

3689.22 --> 3695.16
do that I could have done that

3692.88 --> 3696.78
when I troll I chose trolls and tyrants

3695.16 --> 3699.299
because I thought it was actually more

3696.78 --> 3703.7000000000003
relevant

3699.299 --> 3703.7
and I didn't know the word Graveler yet

3722.88 --> 3725.579
or

3724.68 --> 3729.0
um

3725.579 --> 3732.0
another good dungeon dragon's based name

3729.0 --> 3734.599
would be like gears like gears and

3732.0 --> 3734.599
Grapplers

3735.599 --> 3739.6400000000003
makes it sound very interesting

3743.04 --> 3749.52
goblins and Growlers yeah it is exactly

3746.339 --> 3752.9
because you don't need to call goblins

3749.52 --> 3752.9
if you're gonna call Growlers

3753.0 --> 3758.119
like goblins are kind of automatically

3755.46 --> 3758.119
Grapplers

3760.02 --> 3765.98
not all grabblers are goblins but all

3762.42 --> 3765.98
goblins are gravelers see

3766.38 --> 3771.42
logically

3769.26 --> 3773.94
through character expression and all

3771.42 --> 3776.16
that it's just a consensus people are

3773.94 --> 3778.02
agreeing that that is what it is it's

3776.16 --> 3779.0989999999997
how the Goblins are designed that

3778.02 --> 3781.44
they're designed with the

3779.099 --> 3783.6600000000003
characteristics of Grapplers so there

3781.44 --> 3787.02
you go

3783.66 --> 3788.64
every aspect of it

3787.02 --> 3792.119
so yeah

3788.64 --> 3794.52
but if you say gears well then you're

3792.119 --> 3796.44
giving an indication as to like it's a

3794.52 --> 3799.559
mechanical thing there's a

3796.44 --> 3801.66
there's mechanisms involved and hey we

3799.559 --> 3805.44
all know that grabblers

3801.66 --> 3806.8799999999997
are really proficient with mechanisms

3805.44 --> 3810.0
aren't they

3806.88 --> 3812.9
so gears and Grabbers would act you

3810.0 --> 3812.9
could like do a

3813.299 --> 3821.099
a very mechanism mechanism is like the

3816.599 --> 3823.38
the plane the dimension of

3821.099 --> 3825.119
mechanical order

3823.38 --> 3828.78
in Dungeons and Dragons so you could

3825.119 --> 3831.1800000000003
have a mechanus themed Dungeons and

3828.78 --> 3832.559
Dragons version called gears and

3831.18 --> 3835.2
Grapplers

3832.559 --> 3837.299
and that would be freaking amazing just

3835.2 --> 3839.46
the title alone is already like man

3837.299 --> 3841.799
maybe I I should make another dungeon

3839.46 --> 3844.94
dragon's book just so that I could call

3841.799 --> 3844.94
it gears and Grabbers

3845.04 --> 3848.94
laughs

3846.9 --> 3850.7000000000003
I can't imagine the drawings just like

3848.94 --> 3853.619
see the gears and then

3850.7 --> 3855.7799999999997
the little drug off the grappler like

3853.619 --> 3857.6400000000003
fudging around with the gears I mean

3855.78 --> 3861.2000000000003
dude

3857.64 --> 3861.2
this book would make itself

3865.559 --> 3871.28
you played Dungeons and Dragons in 1979

3868.38 --> 3871.28
right okay

3873.24 --> 3880.68
well I spent an absurd amount of time of

3877.5 --> 3886.44
my life writing this thing

3880.68 --> 3890.8799999999997
and not making any scent of it literally

3886.44 --> 3894.119
because it's all like open source it's

3890.88 --> 3896.339
like yeah you can literally use this

3894.119 --> 3899.339
like this is too good

3896.339 --> 3901.0789999999997
to restrain

3899.339 --> 3904.2
through

3901.079 --> 3907.5
like copyrights

3904.2 --> 3911.22
besides it based on an open system

3907.5 --> 3913.619
on an open source system it is so it is

3911.22 --> 3916.74
open source now I could have modified

3913.619 --> 3919.859
the whole thing to adapt to a non-open

3916.74 --> 3923.22
source system but then yeah then not

3919.859 --> 3925.2
everybody could take it and adapt their

3923.22 --> 3928.3799999999997
Dungeons and Dragons game to a better

3925.2 --> 3932.339
balanced version of it

3928.38 --> 3934.5
that that is like very epic capable

3932.339 --> 3936.66
because that was the one thing about the

3934.5 --> 3938.52
whole legend Dragon systems like oh yeah

3936.66 --> 3941.04
you reached 20 then you become epic and

3938.52 --> 3943.799
then it's all [ __ ] lame and it's like

3941.04 --> 3946.799
yeah you have to grow a huge amount of

3943.799 --> 3949.2
effort to get a little experience and

3946.799 --> 3950.88
then you get [ __ ] lame ass abilities

3949.2 --> 3953.819
it's like oh I got epic abilities

3950.88 --> 3955.44
there's just slightly better than the

3953.819 --> 3957.599
ones I already had

3955.44 --> 3959.46
and it's [ __ ] useless there's nothing

3957.599 --> 3961.92
special

3959.46 --> 3964.859
and that's why basically like rearrange

3961.92 --> 3967.079
the entire system

3964.859 --> 3970.88
development character development system

3967.079 --> 3970.88
for like most things

3972.599 --> 3978.26
and I spend over 10 000 hours on it

3975.24 --> 3978.2599999999998
which is insane

3981.119 --> 3986.88
so here we want to take a look this is

3984.0 --> 3989.46
it it's right here

3986.88 --> 3993.96
unfortunately not all the downloads are

3989.46 --> 3996.96
available still which is kind of sad

3993.96 --> 3998.579
are they all off now no they're not all

3996.96 --> 4002.5
off

3998.579 --> 4002.5
new spells is still there

4004.039 --> 4008.6800000000003
skill description still there very

4006.02 --> 4008.68
important one

4012.5 --> 4017.059
you can find all that in the free

4014.42 --> 4019.46
downloads

4017.059 --> 4021.88
two glasses yeah Prestige classes are

4019.46 --> 4021.88
still there

4022.94 --> 4028.28
Armory

4025.46 --> 4032.92
yeah most things are there

4028.28 --> 4032.92
except for base classes and new feats

4035.72 --> 4042.0789999999997
who you'll like the Arsenal by the way

4038.299 --> 4046.4
that thing was like that's the Arsenal

4042.079 --> 4050.119
is like the collection of all Weaponry

4046.4 --> 4052.299
ever throughout all ages in Dungeons and

4050.119 --> 4052.299
Dragons

4055.94 --> 4062.2400000000002
well nah it's not it's it's I included

4059.119 --> 4064.28
up to Renaissance age

4062.24 --> 4066.319
it's from

4064.28 --> 4069.6800000000003
beginning of the world to Renaissance I

4066.319 --> 4070.7
don't have like like Future Weapons or

4069.68 --> 4072.6189999999997
anything

4070.7 --> 4074.48
but it's like the complete works and

4072.619 --> 4077.2400000000002
it's like

4074.48 --> 4079.46
every weapon that or well it's hard to

4077.24 --> 4083.6189999999997
say is like there's so many different

4079.46 --> 4086.119
weapons that I adapted in this thing

4083.619 --> 4088.96
like you'll hear words that you never

4086.119 --> 4088.96
even heard of

4089.66 --> 4094.339
it's huge

4091.819 --> 4096.799
it's the complete collection of Dungeons

4094.339 --> 4098.54
and Dragons Weaponry is like hundreds

4096.799 --> 4100.5199999999995
and hundreds of them

4098.54 --> 4103.04
right

4100.52 --> 4106.9400000000005
so it's there

4103.04 --> 4109.219
this is what I spend a lot of time on

4106.94 --> 4112.4
in my 30s

4109.219 --> 4115.58
most of my 30s

4112.4 --> 4118.639999999999
no wait that's not true

4115.58 --> 4122.239
most of my 20s actually

4118.64 --> 4125.42
started doing this from 2006

4122.239 --> 4128.3589999999995
to 2000.

4125.42 --> 4130.52
15 is kind of when I stop that's when I

4128.359 --> 4132.5
just the final at the like

4130.52 --> 4135.5
I had some

4132.5 --> 4138.5
little things that were still

4135.5 --> 4140.299
adding

4138.5 --> 4143.6
let's see

4140.299 --> 4145.819
yeah very last update let because I

4143.6 --> 4149.2390000000005
wasn't just developing too many new

4145.819 --> 4151.400000000001
things just modifying details

4149.239 --> 4154.699
you can find all that

4151.4 --> 4157.699
in the developers blog last updated

4154.699 --> 4157.699
2018.

4162.56 --> 4166.52
okay it seems like everybody just went

4164.719 --> 4169.64
away now because they're all bored off

4166.52 --> 4172.359
their ass or they're all like whoa look

4169.64 --> 4172.359
at this man

4172.839 --> 4176.96
another way it's fine you don't have to

4175.58 --> 4180.05
be interested

4176.96 --> 4180.05
[Music]

4181.04 --> 4189.199
it's just I made a lot of effort to make

4185.12 --> 4191.719
this like this is a well I kind of use

4189.199 --> 4194.12
two people I had a friend that's not

4191.719 --> 4195.5
really a friend anymore that also helped

4194.12 --> 4198.08
developing it

4195.5 --> 4199.94
but I'm definitely the number one guy in

4198.08 --> 4202.179
this I've had full Authority it's my

4199.94 --> 4202.178999999999
project

4203.6 --> 4209.2390000000005
and I like

4205.699 --> 4211.46
this is like the ultimate Crown perfect

4209.239 --> 4214.339999999999
version

4211.46 --> 4218.12
of Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 which is

4214.34 --> 4219.92
like arguably the largest expansions the

4218.12 --> 4222.92
most expanded Dungeons and Dragons

4219.92 --> 4224.4800000000005
versions that had ever ever been written

4222.92 --> 4225.7390000000005
and it was the one that they open

4224.48 --> 4227.36
sourced

4225.739 --> 4230.299999999999
so that other people would develop it

4227.36 --> 4232.58
and there's massive amounts of Dungeons

4230.3 --> 4234.92
and Dragons 3.5 books

4232.58 --> 4237.5599999999995
now of course they've moved on to four

4234.92 --> 4239.4800000000005
and five and six and I don't know where

4237.56 --> 4242.0
the [ __ ] they are at now

4239.48 --> 4244.099999999999
but they're just over developing it's

4242.0 --> 4247.12
just to sell more stuff that's the only

4244.1 --> 4247.120000000001
reason they're doing it

4247.64 --> 4252.5
just like with magic the Gathering to

4249.8 --> 4255.52
just like oh the news is the new thing

4252.5 --> 4259.82
coming out it's like season

4255.52 --> 4262.580000000001
85 or 140 I don't know how many freaking

4259.82 --> 4265.34
sets they have now it's insane

4262.58 --> 4267.32
but it's just for sales that's the only

4265.34 --> 4269.2390000000005
reason they do it

4267.32 --> 4271.82
because they are a corporation it is

4269.239 --> 4274.04
Wizards of the Coast yeah Wizards of the

4271.82 --> 4275.659
Coast owns both Magic the Gathering and

4274.04 --> 4279.08
Dungeons and Dragons

4275.659 --> 4283.48
they're just a machine that keeps spread

4279.08 --> 4283.48
it's it's very industrial they just

4283.94 --> 4288.5
oh

4285.86 --> 4293.5599999999995
they just keep stomping the new version

4288.5 --> 4296.54
by this oh the new version by this oh

4293.56 --> 4300.02
buyers they've

4296.54 --> 4302.42
it is hyper corporate like how it is

4300.02 --> 4304.219
actually

4302.42 --> 4306.4400000000005
marketed

4304.219 --> 4309.8
it is just a robot

4306.44 --> 4311.96
but they do have good developers that

4309.8 --> 4314.900000000001
have good ideas though

4311.96 --> 4317.84
it's they are trying stuff they're not

4314.9 --> 4321.139999999999
only recycling exactly the same thing

4317.84 --> 4322.64
over and over they do try new things so

4321.14 --> 4327.02
it's just

4322.64 --> 4329.12
the way they publish it is so robotic

4327.02 --> 4331.34
and it's like clearly like yeah oh this

4329.12 --> 4333.44
is a really good game well then expect

4331.34 --> 4336.02
it that it's not really going to be that

4333.44 --> 4337.879999999999
good anymore in the future if you don't

4336.02 --> 4340.34
buy the updates

4337.88 --> 4343.58
because that's how it works it's kind of

4340.34 --> 4345.860000000001
like apple in that sense that like bits

4343.58 --> 4348.739
of the coast is very much like apple is

4345.86 --> 4351.739
it's like super cool but if you don't

4348.739 --> 4353.959999999999
keep investing in the new stuff then you

4351.739 --> 4357.94
will become outdated and will be useless

4353.96 --> 4357.94
that's kind of how they operate

4363.5 --> 4369.44
maybe you could monetize the guide for

4367.1 --> 4371.860000000001
new dungeon man what the [ __ ] are you

4369.44 --> 4371.86
talking about

4372.5 --> 4377.44
could start a business as a DM tutor

4377.48 --> 4383.959999999999
sure but I mean I don't think that

4381.08 --> 4387.679
really works though

4383.96 --> 4391.28
because being a dungeon master

4387.679 --> 4393.9800000000005
is like a lot of work if you act like

4391.28 --> 4395.92
either you're lazy as [ __ ] and there's a

4393.98 --> 4398.9
lot of prefab stuff

4395.92 --> 4401.4800000000005
or if you're really good and that's what

4398.9 --> 4404.0
I would be teaching well there's this

4401.48 --> 4406.28
nasty stupid thing about being a dungeon

4404.0 --> 4409.46
master and that is you usually don't

4406.28 --> 4412.04
really have a life because of it

4409.46 --> 4416.679
because it takes if you want to do it

4412.04 --> 4416.679
right it takes up so much time

4417.199 --> 4422.5599999999995
otherwise it's it will suck

4419.659 --> 4422.5599999999995
it will be lame

4423.14 --> 4427.820000000001
because as a game master you're

4424.82 --> 4430.34
literally Conjuring in life parallel

4427.82 --> 4433.099999999999
world that you maintain

4430.34 --> 4435.4400000000005
you mean it it remains in existence

4433.1 --> 4439.280000000001
parallel pretty much forever or until

4435.44 --> 4441.98
the group like officially disbands

4439.28 --> 4444.38
I'm still having it interesting I'm

4441.98 --> 4447.0199999999995
still it's in my back of my mind in the

4444.38 --> 4449.4800000000005
resting block since my group split up

4447.02 --> 4451.580000000001
three years ago now

4449.48 --> 4454.839999999999
still secretly hoping that I might

4451.58 --> 4454.84
continue it somehow

4455.05 --> 4459.1990000000005
[Music]

4456.44 --> 4460.879999999999
but yeah I mean if you want to do it

4459.199 --> 4463.099999999999
right

4460.88 --> 4464.659000000001
you're not gonna be like working a

4463.1 --> 4467.42
full-time job

4464.659 --> 4469.879999999999
and game mastering with a bunch of

4467.42 --> 4471.82
Dungeons and Dragons people it doesn't

4469.88 --> 4476.12
happen

4471.82 --> 4479.12
or you'll suck you'll be tired you won't

4476.12 --> 4480.98
be a a deeply inspired Storyteller

4479.12 --> 4482.9
because hey working a full-time job is

4480.98 --> 4484.04
very tiresome

4482.9 --> 4486.379999999999
right

4484.04 --> 4487.94
and you have to prepare material when

4486.38 --> 4490.58
are you going to prepare material how

4487.94 --> 4493.159
are you not gonna be distracted by your

4490.58 --> 4495.86
focus on producing game master material

4493.159 --> 4499.339999999999
properly

4495.86 --> 4502.04
it just doesn't really work

4499.34 --> 4504.8
that's why it works much better

4502.04 --> 4506.0
when you're younger and you're like a

4504.8 --> 4508.360000000001
student

4506.0 --> 4511.78
so you have more time on your hands

4508.36 --> 4511.78
besides studying

4512.84 --> 4517.219
unless you also have to work jobs on the

4515.36 --> 4519.259999999999
side and then you really don't have time

4517.219 --> 4520.699
this for game mastering

4519.26 --> 4522.58
right

4520.699 --> 4526.159
so it's yeah

4522.58 --> 4528.92
game masterings is really difficult and

4526.159 --> 4531.199
I mean it could technically just be a

4528.92 --> 4534.1
paid profession an entertainment

4531.199 --> 4534.099999999999
profession because

4534.14 --> 4538.88
if you're going to do it right it's

4536.6 --> 4541.6
gonna cost so much time you should be

4538.88 --> 4541.6
paid for it

4541.88 --> 4544.4800000000005
really

4547.3 --> 4552.38
and I'm a really freaking good game

4549.92 --> 4554.7390000000005
master because I will conjure this world

4552.38 --> 4558.02
in your mind

4554.739 --> 4560.36
and you will get it

4558.02 --> 4563.080000000001
will get it

4560.36 --> 4566.42
you will have

4563.08 --> 4569.12
Mastery over your character and their

4566.42 --> 4571.64
thinking and their emotions

4569.12 --> 4574.28
and even their connection with God if

4571.64 --> 4576.08
any and it will all become potentially

4574.28 --> 4578.84
very serious

4576.08 --> 4581.179
and I will keep track of all those

4578.84 --> 4583.159000000001
things mostly

4581.179 --> 4585.26
because if it gets really chaotic

4583.159 --> 4587.42
because the players goof around then

4585.26 --> 4590.06
eventually like metadata about their

4587.42 --> 4593.0
characters does become lost which by the

4590.06 --> 4595.04
way is is reasonable because

4593.0 --> 4600.62
well in the real world when you get

4595.04 --> 4602.86
really goofy information is also lost

4600.62 --> 4602.86
right

4605.32 --> 4609.86
right because yeah as a game master

4607.94 --> 4611.96
you're really trying to make it as

4609.86 --> 4615.08
realistic as feasible

4611.96 --> 4617.659
because well it's not literally reality

4615.08 --> 4620.36
it's a world where magic is quite

4617.659 --> 4624.44
intense

4620.36 --> 4627.5
Dungeons and Dragons is high Magic

4624.44 --> 4630.919999999999
now you can make it kind of rare

4627.5 --> 4633.98
but then you'll have a problem because

4630.92 --> 4637.34
now most of the development for the game

4633.98 --> 4641.678999999999
will not be usable because it is a high

4637.34 --> 4641.679
magic system magic is very Central

4644.06 --> 4646.6
oh

4651.5 --> 4655.6
thank you

4652.82 --> 4655.599999999999
hmm

4658.58 --> 4665.54
do you know where it started Monday and

4662.42 --> 4667.96
she was hand carving her own item to an

4665.54 --> 4667.96
oh

4668.36 --> 4673.699
yeah yeah good props I did little

4671.42 --> 4675.5
drawings it's like oh you're getting

4673.699 --> 4677.659
over here

4675.5 --> 4681.58
let me show you what that is and

4677.659 --> 4681.58
actually have a drawing of it

4683.3 --> 4689.2390000000005
if I showed that

4685.46 --> 4692.3
let's see I have it it was seven okay I

4689.239 --> 4695.0199999999995
forgot about the kitty still there

4692.3 --> 4695.02
okay

4712.179 --> 4715.36
[ __ ] hell

4720.04 --> 4725.8
I have too much oh yeah of course it

4723.26 --> 4725.8
gets here

4727.54 --> 4730.719
let's see

4730.76 --> 4737.84
this is it right

4733.88 --> 4740.02
no this isn't it the [ __ ] sake what is

4737.84 --> 4740.02
it

4745.52 --> 4751.040000000001
maybe the last one

4748.58 --> 4753.93
yeah oh my God it's actually the last

4751.04 --> 4756.969
one that I got Jesus

4753.93 --> 4756.969
[Music]

4757.52 --> 4759.9400000000005
let's see

4761.3 --> 4766.96
and we're gonna overmap

4763.06 --> 4766.96
where's the opening map

4768.52 --> 4773.14
this thing is so freaking elaborate

4774.98 --> 4778.11
there's no over map

4776.84 --> 4782.89
the [ __ ]

4778.11 --> 4782.889999999999
[Music]

4792.92 --> 4795.64
hey

4797.3 --> 4799.54
foreign

4815.42 --> 4819.46
right anyway this is like

4822.679 --> 4828.38
Goblin Fortress

4825.14 --> 4830.54
so this is like a view a 3D view of

4828.38 --> 4831.86
looking at it from the start of the

4830.54 --> 4836.12
bridge

4831.86 --> 4837.58
looking at a big lava chasm

4836.12 --> 4840.98
with it

4837.58 --> 4843.58
steel forged Fortress suspended by

4840.98 --> 4843.58
chains

4844.179 --> 4852.56
lit by the lava deep above

4847.4 --> 4855.32
is actually an adamantine forging

4852.56 --> 4857.120000000001
station from the doors but it got

4855.32 --> 4858.0199999999995
conquered by goblins as one of your

4857.12 --> 4860.0599999999995
missions

4858.02 --> 4863.06
all right so now I have a

4860.06 --> 4867.5
top-down View

4863.06 --> 4871.780000000001
Bridge so you know like how big it is

4867.5 --> 4871.78
and there's the side view

4877.28 --> 4881.78
side views

4879.08 --> 4885.159
and then there's the internals

4881.78 --> 4885.159
what's actually inside

4885.739 --> 4890.199
view top down View

4891.199 --> 4896.0599999999995
other layer

4893.199 --> 4899.0599999999995
and then

4896.06 --> 4900.02
the top on top what's on top not a lot

4899.06 --> 4901.580000000001
of stuff

4900.02 --> 4903.5
and

4901.58 --> 4906.5
the middle layer so it's like a three

4903.5 --> 4909.82
layered station pretty cramped but yeah

4906.5 --> 4909.82
the dwarfs don't give a [ __ ]

4913.28 --> 4915.88
the look

4917.719 --> 4924.56
at it all right so I I just yeah this is

4922.219 --> 4926.96
the type of stuff that I make

4924.56 --> 4929.179
but again here's the script

4926.96 --> 4930.92
I even standardized the whole thing

4929.179 --> 4934.84
because I was going to potentially

4930.92 --> 4934.84
publish so it's like that's

4934.88 --> 4941.78
five pages of basic instruction of

4937.82 --> 4944.239
liking you could say like go to

4941.78 --> 4946.46
if this happens go to that if that

4944.239 --> 4948.678999999999
happens go to this

4946.46 --> 4951.52
kind of

4948.679 --> 4951.52
instructions

4952.219 --> 4956.3
right

4953.96 --> 4959.44
what to do with it as a game master when

4956.3 --> 4959.4400000000005
you approach this area

4970.56 --> 4973.759
[Music]

4981.02 --> 4986.179
is

4983.199 --> 4988.879999999999
the Tata

4986.179 --> 4991.76
oh yeah

4988.88 --> 4994.64
cool I even drew that awesome

4991.76 --> 4997.400000000001
so yeah this is the main

4994.64 --> 5000.88
Fortress dead or Fortress this is the

4997.4 --> 5004.179
main village city of the Dwarfs

5000.88 --> 5006.219
on the outskirts that this is the

5004.179 --> 5008.92
vantage point this is where you have to

5006.219 --> 5012.699
get to the adamantine Forge from in here

5008.92 --> 5014.9800000000005
so it's like a giant cave over water

5012.699 --> 5017.44
with some dwarvish

5014.98 --> 5021.659
construction which have a particular

5017.44 --> 5021.659
style this is just what I chose it to be

5023.8 --> 5027.12
top down flooring

5028.42 --> 5034.4800000000005
and then you see this thing here

5031.6 --> 5037.5
from another angle from the back it's

5034.48 --> 5037.5
actually a temple

5047.24 --> 5050.2789999999995
[Applause]

5056.08 --> 5058.86
all right

5061.73 --> 5064.79
[Music]

5072.46 --> 5075.9
here's another Fortress

5076.54 --> 5082.32
oh man sorry I'm just nostalgically

5079.06 --> 5082.320000000001
looking through all this [ __ ]

5084.28 --> 5087.659
so much material man

5088.42 --> 5092.5
and literally I could just play this

5090.219 --> 5094.659
it's like oh come over you want to spend

5092.5 --> 5097.48
the next two years playing Dungeons and

5094.659 --> 5098.94
Dragons I literally don't even have to

5097.48 --> 5101.739
ride anything

5098.94 --> 5105.879999999999
it's because it's all here

5101.739 --> 5108.48
right so here you have another Fortress

5105.88 --> 5110.9800000000005
bigger than the adamantine Forge

5108.48 --> 5115.199
basically the same bottom model though

5110.98 --> 5115.199
but it is like has Towers on it

5117.6 --> 5123.84
and inside

5120.88 --> 5123.84
schematics

5127.179 --> 5132.4
right they built it yes it's not

5130.239 --> 5135.5199999999995
architecturally sound

5132.4 --> 5138.04
this is I'm sure it isn't I tried though

5135.52 --> 5140.92
I try to make it look like that

5138.04 --> 5143.26
there's the inside

5140.92 --> 5146.02
right because these are all gonna be

5143.26 --> 5149.14
drawn out on plates

5146.02 --> 5152.080000000001
which you then put your pawns on

5149.14 --> 5154.780000000001
that are gonna walk around on this

5152.08 --> 5157.26
it's all the layers so here's the other

5154.78 --> 5157.259999999999
layer

5159.639 --> 5164.639
and then there's the top Tower layers

5165.94 --> 5172.599999999999
see

5168.76 --> 5176.159000000001
ah it's the great Fortress of iron fold

5172.6 --> 5176.159000000001
yeah that's what I call it

5176.5 --> 5182.01
let's decide to you hey

5179.8 --> 5183.820000000001
I don't know oh yeah here

5182.01 --> 5185.1990000000005
[Applause]

5183.82 --> 5187.44
all right so this is the whole thing

5185.199 --> 5187.44
again

5190.61 --> 5194.228999999999
[Music]

5199.36 --> 5206.199
here you got some wild caves

5202.9 --> 5207.5199999999995
that are also part of this

5206.199 --> 5210.04
oh wait uh

5207.52 --> 5213.0
yeah this is

5210.04 --> 5217.36
it's like this weird

5213.0 --> 5219.52
Rocky warped way it's like this tube of

5217.36 --> 5221.32
rock that's just connected to a bottom

5219.52 --> 5223.900000000001
there's water on the floor

5221.32 --> 5226.42
very creepy looking cave and this

5223.9 --> 5229.0199999999995
Monster's all over you can hear them

5226.42 --> 5230.26
Screech and crawl everywhere

5229.02 --> 5232.84
[Music]

5230.26 --> 5236.02
the monster tape

5232.84 --> 5238.54
there's a little Goblin Fortress

5236.02 --> 5240.159000000001
of course this is an action that they

5238.54 --> 5242.679
actually made this that's why it looks

5240.159 --> 5245.339999999999
like a gigantic mess because it is a

5242.679 --> 5245.34
gigantic mess

5245.679 --> 5251.32
cool isn't it this is deeper into that

5248.139 --> 5253.06
cave I'm gonna try to find the map the

5251.32 --> 5255.07
oversight map it has to be somewhere

5253.06 --> 5260.169000000001
where the [ __ ] is

5255.07 --> 5260.169
[Music]

5265.239 --> 5271.678999999999
it what is the back

5268.06 --> 5271.679
to there oh

5272.02 --> 5277.179
all right what is the freaking oversight

5274.42 --> 5279.46
map I don't get it

5277.179 --> 5282.479
has to be somewhere

5279.46 --> 5282.479
[Music]

5295.179 --> 5298.7390000000005
where's the oversight map

5305.199 --> 5308.46
maybe it's on my computer

5310.06 --> 5314.979
foreign

5311.9 --> 5314.978999999999
[Music]

5319.36 --> 5324.46
I don't know why I didn't print it out

5321.4 --> 5326.32
and put it in there though

5324.46 --> 5328.179
let's see

5326.32 --> 5331.139
hope you guys are still entertained not

5328.179 --> 5331.139
bored by all this

5343.78 --> 5346.44
come on

5346.84 --> 5349.84
terrariah

5352.84 --> 5356.76
see where are ya

5363.639 --> 5366.900000000001
old campaign

5367.54 --> 5372.06
where are the Goblins of Iron Forge

5385.6 --> 5387.900000000001
foreign

5407.08 --> 5410.04
where is it

5410.98 --> 5414.178999999999
man I got so much

5424.239 --> 5428.259999999999
I can't believe things are still that

5425.98 --> 5430.98
hard to find even though I've organized

5428.26 --> 5430.9800000000005
it all so well

5432.53 --> 5435.88
[Music]

5436.48 --> 5440.04
where's the pictures though

5441.94 --> 5444.94
Maps

5456.9 --> 5462.96
location maps wait is this it

5460.12 --> 5462.96
hammers no

5464.76 --> 5472.7390000000005
Mount iron plot yes freaking hell that

5468.94 --> 5472.739
took me long enough finally found it

5473.08 --> 5477.159
uh

5474.52 --> 5479.679
yes there you go

5477.159 --> 5481.299999999999
of an allies campaign

5479.679 --> 5483.34
map

5481.3 --> 5485.8
there it is

5483.34 --> 5488.860000000001
oh my God I don't know why I don't have

5485.8 --> 5491.26
this printed out it should be or maybe

5488.86 --> 5494.28
it's because it's not entirely done yet

5491.26 --> 5494.280000000001
almost done

5494.739 --> 5498.78
right so let's get this on the screen

5499.6 --> 5502.729
[Music]

5504.34 --> 5507.42
all right there you go

5509.44 --> 5514.239
so this is the oversight of what I was

5512.02 --> 5516.639
just showing

5514.239 --> 5519.04
the city

5516.639 --> 5521.28
is here you were looking from this

5519.04 --> 5521.28
direction

5521.739 --> 5525.638999999999
right

5523.139 --> 5528.58
then over here

5525.639 --> 5531.219
is the actual iron four or the the

5528.58 --> 5532.719
adamantine Forge

5531.219 --> 5536.199
right

5532.719 --> 5538.4800000000005
uh what else did I show

5536.199 --> 5542.638999999999
yeah here is that

5538.48 --> 5542.638999999999
uh that bigger Fortress

5542.92 --> 5549.4
and it showed here is like the big caves

5546.04 --> 5552.0
weird wobbly caves here is the goblin

5549.4 --> 5552.0
Fortress

5552.36 --> 5557.38
uh yeah that I think that's kind of what

5556.12 --> 5559.179
it showed

5557.38 --> 5561.9400000000005
and there's more stuff here's the mind

5559.179 --> 5564.78
the iron mines

5561.94 --> 5567.219
but I mean yeah so this is a pretty

5564.78 --> 5568.239
elaborate campaign oh yeah there's an

5567.219 --> 5570.159
old

5568.239 --> 5574.0599999999995
uh

5570.159 --> 5576.94
burial site like very like that's really

5574.06 --> 5579.6990000000005
old stuff I don't I'd have to reread it

5576.94 --> 5581.379999999999
exactly as to how I designated it I did

5579.699 --> 5583.599999999999
all tie it in together I kind of forgot

5581.38 --> 5586.8
because it's like

5583.6 --> 5586.8
six years ago

5591.88 --> 5599.28
yeah yeah here's the uh the dwarves have

5595.719 --> 5599.28
an actual lava pump

5600.34 --> 5605.860000000001
because now yeah now now I remember this

5602.86 --> 5609.4
that thing that round thing wasn't

5605.86 --> 5612.099999999999
actually a temple it's a

5609.4 --> 5614.739
a power generating system that's a heat

5612.1 --> 5617.52
turbine because now I remember that

5614.739 --> 5621.759999999999
water that's in the in the city area

5617.52 --> 5624.820000000001
they let it down put it into the tube

5621.76 --> 5628.06
goes through Lava from a little active

5624.82 --> 5630.4
volcano that's like there they built a

5628.06 --> 5632.9800000000005
little system where there's lava there

5630.4 --> 5635.86
that heats the water and then the

5632.98 --> 5638.879999999999
one-way valve presses all the way back

5635.86 --> 5641.32
up and then there's steam literally here

5638.88 --> 5643.54
driving a turbine

5641.32 --> 5646.0
so that they have mechanic yeah they

5643.54 --> 5649.54
have literal

5646.0 --> 5653.04
yeah steam driven mechanical pumps in

5649.54 --> 5653.04
their little Dwarven town

5655.36 --> 5661.199
you should frame them

5658.3 --> 5661.1990000000005
sure whatever

5664.54 --> 5667.5
all right

5667.96 --> 5671.34
yeah that's cool stuff

5675.04 --> 5680.76
let's see if the pumping station if I

5677.86 --> 5680.759999999999
had a picture of that

5681.04 --> 5683.4
okay

5684.14 --> 5687.1990000000005
[Music]

5689.5 --> 5696.04
[Applause]

5692.139 --> 5699.0
oh yeah all right a top down side this

5696.04 --> 5699.0
is the pumping station

5700.719 --> 5703.38
basically

5704.199 --> 5710.62
top down sides

5706.719 --> 5710.62
so this is above

5711.639 --> 5716.1990000000005
City pumping station

5714.4 --> 5718.599999999999
water

5716.199 --> 5722.86
and then let the water down here through

5718.6 --> 5724.96
the lava gets heated pump back up

5722.86 --> 5727.96
oh and there's a freaking Gap in between

5724.96 --> 5730.06
there too and then in the campaign a

5727.96 --> 5732.04
problem arrives because of something

5730.06 --> 5734.1990000000005
that happens further there and it

5732.04 --> 5735.46
actually disrupts this whole thing and

5734.199 --> 5738.638999999999
then you have to

5735.46 --> 5741.1
like demons or something come out of the

5738.639 --> 5743.26
the crevice and you have to fend them

5741.1 --> 5746.56
off while the dwarves try to repair the

5743.26 --> 5750.12
pipes very typical but should be very

5746.56 --> 5750.120000000001
entertaining and spooky

5751.3 --> 5754.3
foreign

5766.42 --> 5769.9800000000005
everybody's falling asleep

5770.44 --> 5773.04
Maybe

5775.48 --> 5779.379999999999
it's a lot more interesting when you

5777.46 --> 5781.659
actually get a first person perspective

5779.38 --> 5783.639
with the characters and I put you

5781.659 --> 5786.04
through it like that

5783.639 --> 5788.400000000001
then me just showing you the stuff that

5786.04 --> 5788.4
I made

5791.82 --> 5798.28
because in the game you have to actually

5794.86 --> 5801.159
earn that data that's all been made you

5798.28 --> 5803.62
have to earn that you have to get the

5801.159 --> 5805.96
information in the game

5803.62 --> 5808.42
and then eventually you do get these

5805.96 --> 5811.659
Maps available to you

5808.42 --> 5814.179
stuff in your face dank okay

5811.659 --> 5816.219
anyway I'm gonna stop my face because I

5814.179 --> 5818.62
got an Illuminati game

5816.219 --> 5821.38
ah damn it it's cold okay let me put

5818.62 --> 5824.46
that back in the oven

5821.38 --> 5824.46
be right back

5919.36 --> 5922.08
oh

5925.38 --> 5928.86
my God

5970.36 --> 5973.86
can you followed me

5974.86 --> 5980.08
okay

5977.08 --> 5980.08
foreign

5994.199 --> 5999.659
NASA called their Fantasy game what fact

6004.679 --> 6007.34
cool

6012.0 --> 6015.0
wow

6015.719 --> 6018.86
this is so cool

6020.34 --> 6024.6
okay let me show you a little insight on

6022.86 --> 6028.199
how I actually

6024.6 --> 6032.88
designed this stuff with my map making

6028.199 --> 6035.159
so this is the mountain

6032.88 --> 6037.26
of everything that I just showed on the

6035.159 --> 6039.98
outside right this is this is like the

6037.26 --> 6039.9800000000005
rough scan

6040.32 --> 6046.5199999999995
from

6042.42 --> 6046.52
where is that derived from let's see

6047.04 --> 6051.56
new world map

6048.96 --> 6051.56
mine

6056.04 --> 6061.44
one

6058.44 --> 6064.62
yeah let's just say from this one

6061.44 --> 6067.219
let's see oh that doesn't work that way

6064.62 --> 6067.219
damn it

6067.5 --> 6069.98
okay

6071.219 --> 6076.139
does this work yeah

6073.38 --> 6077.219
from that one

6076.139 --> 6078.6
see

6077.219 --> 6080.1
that

6078.6 --> 6083.1
little

6080.1 --> 6084.900000000001
thing here this is a mountain it's not

6083.1 --> 6087.679
colored in

6084.9 --> 6087.679
so that

6087.9 --> 6091.759999999999
ah damn it where was I

6093.12 --> 6096.86
turned into this

6098.52 --> 6103.38
and then

6100.139 --> 6105.179
I start to fit the map in there the

6103.38 --> 6107.159000000001
original map

6105.179 --> 6111.179
let me scroll

6107.159 --> 6112.799999999999
is like the map put together of the of

6111.179 --> 6115.5
that campaign that I just showed you

6112.8 --> 6119.159000000001
it's right here see

6115.5 --> 6125.219
then from this I turned it into this

6119.159 --> 6127.44
and then started to shape it to fit this

6125.219 --> 6129.119
is what happens

6127.44 --> 6132.119
poof

6129.119 --> 6135.54
and that's now how it then fits this is

6132.119 --> 6137.639
what's inside the mountain or oh not the

6135.54 --> 6140.699
top of it it's it's really like deep

6137.639 --> 6142.9400000000005
inside downward that's why there's lava

6140.699 --> 6142.94
here

6142.98 --> 6146.5199999999995
in a cavern

6144.6 --> 6148.7390000000005
that's stable it's like it's not

6146.52 --> 6151.679
actually been revealed to be a volcano

6148.739 --> 6155.459999999999
there's just lava underneath it

6151.679 --> 6158.42
right and this is it has become the

6155.46 --> 6158.42
outside of the mountain

6158.52 --> 6161.820000000001
this is what on top of it there's

6160.679 --> 6164.4
actually

6161.82 --> 6167.88
sort of a hidden green little Paradise

6164.4 --> 6171.0
where water collects and it's not frozen

6167.88 --> 6172.619
on top of that mountain it's not even

6171.0 --> 6175.44
that high really

6172.619 --> 6177.179
but it's steep

6175.44 --> 6180.0599999999995
and there's a little Hidden Paradise

6177.179 --> 6182.659
there's like fairies living there

6180.06 --> 6182.659000000001
right

6183.659 --> 6189.96
and there's a mansion here

6187.08 --> 6191.82
that deals like they're competing with

6189.96 --> 6194.82
the freaking fairies is basically some

6191.82 --> 6197.28
rich snob that's weird and eccentric

6194.82 --> 6200.82
potentially a werewolf I don't remember

6197.28 --> 6202.739
the campaign exactly part about that

6200.82 --> 6204.0599999999995
but it's the issue you deal with when

6202.739 --> 6206.82
you go there

6204.06 --> 6209.159000000001
all right ah here's that cave

6206.82 --> 6210.659
this is actually easier to just show it

6209.159 --> 6213.799999999999
like this

6210.659 --> 6213.799999999999
here's the entrance

6216.239 --> 6219.5
Goblin Fortress

6222.3 --> 6227.400000000001
what else ah

6225.0 --> 6230.1
yeah this is another part it's a

6227.4 --> 6233.0
a wall

6230.1 --> 6233.0
blocking you

6235.199 --> 6241.08
uh this was a bridge on the mine

6239.159 --> 6243.119
that is a risky one

6241.08 --> 6245.76
because there's goblins on the other

6243.119 --> 6248.099999999999
side that are about to sabotage it when

6245.76 --> 6250.26
you walk over it

6248.1 --> 6252.360000000001
spoilers

6250.26 --> 6254.34
The Fortress again oh now you can bet

6252.36 --> 6255.659
much better see like it has shadowing

6254.34 --> 6257.159000000001
because there's light coming from

6255.659 --> 6259.638999999999
beneath

6257.159 --> 6259.638999999999
see

6259.679 --> 6264.86
from the lava

6261.36 --> 6264.86
there's no other light sources

6267.719 --> 6274.52
the map again just recycling now yeah

6271.5 --> 6274.52
back to the beginning

6274.92 --> 6277.82
there you go

6281.699 --> 6285.0199999999995
anybody still here

6286.32 --> 6289.98
everything I showed is all my own

6288.36 --> 6294.299999999999
personal work

6289.98 --> 6296.099999999999
all hand and drawn and scanned and then

6294.3 --> 6298.9400000000005
drawn over it again and scanned and

6296.1 --> 6298.9400000000005
drawn over it again

6302.94 --> 6307.86
you can use these images and make a

6304.86 --> 6309.36
Shadow type gate type game yeah or I

6307.86 --> 6311.639
could

6309.36 --> 6314.339999999999
do something else dude I can technically

6311.639 --> 6315.719
digitize this I can make this into a

6314.34 --> 6319.4400000000005
digital

6315.719 --> 6322.199
video game place

6319.44 --> 6325.619
I can do that too

6322.199 --> 6327.78
good stuff mate thanks protosser

6325.619 --> 6331.28
hmm

6327.78 --> 6331.28
let me get my Illuminati Festival

6347.219 --> 6350.219
okay

6375.719 --> 6378.44
thanks

6385.08 --> 6389.29
thank you

6386.16 --> 6389.29
[Music]

6390.239 --> 6395.218999999999
can people make a living designing and

6392.4 --> 6399.659
selling DND stuff

6395.219 --> 6402.06
maybe it depends on how yeah

6399.659 --> 6404.759999999999
I mean technically yeah if like a

6402.06 --> 6407.639
corporation gives you

6404.76 --> 6409.58
priority in a green light

6407.639 --> 6413.34
or if you're like

6409.58 --> 6416.04
really good with with Nerds and you just

6413.34 --> 6417.84
put yourself out there and like have

6416.04 --> 6419.46
your great stuff and advertise it well

6417.84 --> 6423.0
then you could

6419.46 --> 6425.34
get a decent living from it probably

6423.0 --> 6427.02
have to like go to Comic Cons all the

6425.34 --> 6428.9400000000005
time and all that right

6427.02 --> 6430.26
I mean it'd just be a business I think

6428.94 --> 6431.719
yeah

6430.26 --> 6434.9400000000005
I could

6431.719 --> 6436.5
potentially make some decent money out

6434.94 --> 6439.5
of it but the problem is I'm like

6436.5 --> 6441.239
terribly organized you see I'm basically

6439.5 --> 6443.96
just the designer

6441.239 --> 6447.54
I'm not like

6443.96 --> 6449.4
uh a well an organ I'm just an artist

6447.54 --> 6452.46
I'm not

6449.4 --> 6454.799999999999
like a guy that knows how to like put

6452.46 --> 6457.56
this in illustrator and make it like a

6454.8 --> 6459.719
perfect product like I I have absolutely

6457.56 --> 6464.219
no expertise about that

6459.719 --> 6467.78
cost me a lot of effort to even make

6464.219 --> 6474.2390000000005
my trolls and tyrants book into a doable

6467.78 --> 6478.32
PDF format that cost me a lot of effort

6474.239 --> 6481.5
because it was absolutely necessary

6478.32 --> 6484.0199999999995
but like I'm not that type of guy that's

6481.5 --> 6486.42
good at that

6484.02 --> 6490.400000000001
I needed somebody else's help and

6486.42 --> 6490.4
research to even be able to do it

6490.86 --> 6496.619
all right so

6492.96 --> 6499.38
as a one-man company no

6496.619 --> 6501.299999999999
but if I'd have an actual well

6499.38 --> 6503.96
publishing

6501.3 --> 6506.9400000000005
people other

6503.96 --> 6509.76
co-workers whatever

6506.94 --> 6511.799999999999
yeah I guess I couldn't really make it

6509.76 --> 6514.08
into a very cool product but then again

6511.8 --> 6517.1990000000005
there is a lot of competition and people

6514.08 --> 6519.719
are even like using Ai and all that

6517.199 --> 6522.9
Auto generated stuff a lot of it is now

6519.719 --> 6524.82
just like oh a digital environment

6522.9 --> 6528.659
like who needs a book when you can just

6524.82 --> 6532.199
have an interactive digital environment

6528.659 --> 6534.179
to use for your gaming for your tabletop

6532.199 --> 6536.04
experience you have the screen to look

6534.179 --> 6540.139
at instead of

6536.04 --> 6540.139
sketched or painted paper

6540.239 --> 6547.82
it's a very heavily developing territory

6542.82 --> 6547.82
digitally and I am not up to date

6551.04 --> 6556.8
I'm just an imagineer you could say I'm

6553.86 --> 6559.44
somebody that like just comes up with

6556.8 --> 6561.96
areas and Adventures in the areas and

6559.44 --> 6564.739
that's what I then draw it's all on

6561.96 --> 6564.7390000000005
paper and

6565.739 --> 6570.739
that's it that's what I do that's what

6568.26 --> 6570.7390000000005
I'm good at

6571.44 --> 6578.239
I'm not good at marketeering or

6574.26 --> 6578.2390000000005
illustrator or any of that

6580.699 --> 6586.199
and I'm not super good with Nerds either

6583.92 --> 6589.679
I mean I am decently well but I'm not

6586.199 --> 6592.739
like a I know I get nerds

6589.679 --> 6595.38
but I'm not like really good at like oh

6592.739 --> 6597.48
I can like make nerds want to give me

6595.38 --> 6601.400000000001
money or something

6597.48 --> 6601.4
that's no not so good

6607.38 --> 6612.3
unless all you guys consider yourself

6609.6 --> 6615.7390000000005
nerds then I would have to reassess that

6612.3 --> 6615.7390000000005
opinion about myself

6616.32 --> 6619.639
because then I would be getting money

6618.3 --> 6622.38
from there it's

6619.639 --> 6625.38
but not probably not

6622.38 --> 6625.38
uh

6633.8 --> 6638.360000000001
hey speeder by the way

6641.88 --> 6646.88
from the side grow reacts hello

6653.16 --> 6656.47
[Music]

6709.58 --> 6717.119
but yeah your point dank being

6713.28 --> 6720.36
I yeah I can technically adapt the areas

6717.119 --> 6721.98
to another sword again but the rules are

6720.36 --> 6725.58
gonna matter because

6721.98 --> 6727.259999999999
I design all this stuff like with in

6725.58 --> 6730.8
mind

6727.26 --> 6733.26
like the people or the dwarfs get in

6730.8 --> 6736.159000000001
there they apply their technology they

6733.26 --> 6739.4400000000005
design things

6736.159 --> 6742.259999999999
adapted to what they know typically

6739.44 --> 6744.178999999999
happens in this world because of magical

6742.26 --> 6746.46
influences and all kinds of things and

6744.179 --> 6748.1990000000005
monsters out there

6746.46 --> 6751.86
right

6748.199 --> 6754.138999999999
so if there's an another setting and a

6751.86 --> 6756.659
completely different game that might

6754.139 --> 6758.28
have other rules of how things work and

6756.659 --> 6760.86
with what what is important and

6758.28 --> 6763.5
influential well then

6760.86 --> 6765.78
it might be a little difficult to adapt

6763.5 --> 6768.96
all that because some things would just

6765.78 --> 6771.0599999999995
seem to not very much make sense

6768.96 --> 6774.36
in that other type of game

6771.06 --> 6776.820000000001
about the design of it but who knows

6774.36 --> 6779.28
technically you could literally just

6776.82 --> 6782.78
modify the area slightly and adapt it to

6779.28 --> 6782.78
another game yeah that is possible

6783.179 --> 6786.5
and the cats

6787.52 --> 6791.219
what are you doing

6790.08 --> 6793.18
hello

6791.219 --> 6794.88
hey don't do that

6793.18 --> 6797.76
[Music]

6794.88 --> 6800.659000000001
my left my couch is not for your nails

6797.76 --> 6800.659000000001
Kitty

6811.34 --> 6815.659000000001
oh I didn't expect

6817.8 --> 6824.4800000000005
just didn't expect that to happen but

6820.92 --> 6824.4800000000005
there you go hey Kitty

6825.48 --> 6829.04

6942.96 --> 6948.679
scratching post I mean she can use the

6945.06 --> 6948.679
bottom of it but not the top

6952.02 --> 6955.6990000000005
and it's like raining outside

6962.06 --> 6965.6
Bond villain

6965.82 --> 6968.659
perhaps

6970.38 --> 6977.34
although I'm a very poor Bond villain so

6973.98 --> 6980.5199999999995
I guess not really about that okay

6977.34 --> 6982.76
yeah okay this is cute but

6980.52 --> 6982.76
no

6989.34 --> 6993.32
thank you okay come on

6994.86 --> 6997.639
foreign

7000.739 --> 7003.94
so much hair

7009.86 --> 7017.259999999999
oh my God I can literally see the hair

7012.86 --> 7017.259999999999
floating in front of me this is

7019.58 --> 7025.42
so static and stuff

7022.239 --> 7025.419999999999
through here

7025.82 --> 7028.599999999999
you go outside

7037.96 --> 7044.54
now let's

7040.54 --> 7044.54
get eaten

7048.86 --> 7053.239
um

7050.239 --> 7053.239
perfect

7070.88 --> 7076.0
Brown accent table white no those are

7073.52 --> 7076.0
all lemons

7076.34 --> 7080.26
they're really dried out

7080.54 --> 7088.0
those are like lemons I put there

7084.08 --> 7088.0
I think in 2020 or something

7091.219 --> 7094.599
where they're just props now

7106.719 --> 7111.88
you can juggle these they're very hard

7120.199 --> 7123.199
juggling

7128.36 --> 7130.96
yeah

7131.179 --> 7139.0
I got superb hand eye coordination but I

7134.719 --> 7139.0
do not I am not good at juggling

7147.619 --> 7150.619
foreign

7168.639 --> 7176.0
will try to replace most professions and

7173.36 --> 7178.339999999999
then something that's all AI will simply

7176.0 --> 7180.139
become discovered as being no longer

7178.34 --> 7184.04
humans involved

7180.139 --> 7186.86
it will naturally alienate itself

7184.04 --> 7188.84
from their target audience and then it

7186.86 --> 7191.54
will go bust because everybody avoided

7188.84 --> 7194.06
like a plague

7191.54 --> 7195.86
because it's like you're not feeling

7194.06 --> 7198.219
like you're actually helping a person

7195.86 --> 7198.219
anymore

7198.32 --> 7204.94
there's just a robot trying to

7201.679 --> 7204.9400000000005
get stuff from you

7211.46 --> 7218.659
so yeah I mean AI cannot replace all job

7214.82 --> 7221.599
because if it does then people simply

7218.659 --> 7223.78
don't want to have business with it

7221.599 --> 7223.78
anymore

7227.42 --> 7232.599
except for well yeah

7230.78 --> 7237.04
I don't know

7232.599 --> 7239.96
useless climate change people whatever

7237.04 --> 7243.26
sjws some of them

7239.96 --> 7245.78
think that oh no let's I don't like

7243.26 --> 7248.360000000001
dealing with humans because looking at

7245.78 --> 7249.8
them reminds me of how much of a [ __ ]

7248.36 --> 7252.739
loser I am

7249.8 --> 7254.5
so no I want the robots

7252.739 --> 7257.678999999999
those idiots

7254.5 --> 7257.679
that's right

7269.9 --> 7274.159
but I mean those areas are not gonna

7272.54 --> 7277.4
live long

7274.159 --> 7280.098999999999
like they're not gonna like they're not

7277.4 --> 7282.739
built to repopulate right so they're

7280.099 --> 7285.159000000001
just eventually just gonna whimper and

7282.739 --> 7285.159
die out

7285.26 --> 7290.7390000000005
be be a generation of old weirdos and

7288.139 --> 7294.159000000001
then disappear because it's not is

7290.739 --> 7294.159
self-sustaining culture

7295.48 --> 7301.879999999999
no name nay nay

7299.9 --> 7304.719
nay

7301.88 --> 7304.719
back there

7322.55 --> 7325.749
[Music]

7334.35 --> 7337.459000000001
[Music]

7344.36 --> 7351.799999999999
yeah besides

7347.3 --> 7354.26
if there's one jaw that's actually very

7351.8 --> 7357.52
easy to do for a robot

7354.26 --> 7357.52
it's polishing

7358.28 --> 7362.8
yeah

7360.199 --> 7366.5599999999995
you could literally have

7362.8 --> 7368.92
polishing drones that can fly and it

7366.56 --> 7368.92
could just

7369.08 --> 7374.84
with like a laser scanner for the actual

7371.84 --> 7377.659000000001
rough activity level just just go around

7374.84 --> 7380.9800000000005
a gigantic building and just fly polish

7377.659 --> 7380.98
it all the way like

7381.26 --> 7386.54
we don't need human robot polishers yeah

7384.199 --> 7389.839999999999
that's like one of the things that

7386.54 --> 7392.119
specifically you don't need humans for

7389.84 --> 7393.7390000000005
it's all pointless what you need humans

7392.119 --> 7398.239
for is for their resourcefulness

7393.739 --> 7401.199
creativity and adaptability and in yeah

7398.239 --> 7401.199
intuition

7401.3 --> 7407.3
finding a way through that's what you

7404.06 --> 7408.38
need humans for not for manual labor

7407.3 --> 7410.42
like

7408.38 --> 7413.179
like robot polishing that's like one of

7410.42 --> 7416.1990000000005
the things you don't need humans for

7413.179 --> 7416.1990000000005
this pointless

7432.199 --> 7437.659
robots and AI need humans for their

7435.739 --> 7440.0
development

7437.659 --> 7441.619
because if you just leave the AI to

7440.0 --> 7443.78
develop itself yeah it will become

7441.619 --> 7446.659
really efficient and quick

7443.78 --> 7448.58
and then start alienating itself and

7446.659 --> 7451.36
become dysfunctional

7448.58 --> 7451.36
that's what happens

7454.639 --> 7460.900000000001
AI will always need humans to tell it

7457.52 --> 7460.900000000001
what is actually reasonable

7462.81 --> 7467.080000000001
[Music]

7464.119 --> 7471.82
if it's self-developing then it can't

7467.08 --> 7471.82
sense what is reasonable

7474.5 --> 7477.5
foreign

7481.4 --> 7486.32
if anybody can follow what I'm talking

7483.5 --> 7489.86
about I don't know chats the chats come

7486.32 --> 7492.699
a bit become a bit slow seems

7489.86 --> 7492.699
yellow fruit

7527.54 --> 7530.54
foreign

7546.159 --> 7551.719
so is anybody gonna say [ __ ] anything

7548.719 --> 7553.58
in my chat already

7551.719 --> 7554.659
the four minutes of silence out of

7553.58 --> 7558.639
nowhere

7554.659 --> 7558.638999999999
after this random yapping

7578.599 --> 7584.4400000000005
yeah I will make some people more

7580.94 --> 7584.44
productive and others redundant

7585.139 --> 7587.679
Maybe

7588.34 --> 7591.34
thank you

7593.119 --> 7599.239
but so will people if they are tasked to

7596.84 --> 7601.159000000001
make things work more efficient and more

7599.239 --> 7604.659
effectively

7601.159 --> 7608.138999999999
it's just the natural consequences of

7604.659 --> 7608.138999999999
procedural development

7623.43 --> 7631.9490000000005
[Music]

7646.159 --> 7650.719
already made an Android nurse yeah like

7648.679 --> 7653.179
I'd want to be [ __ ] taken care of by

7650.719 --> 7656.5
an Android nurse

7653.179 --> 7656.5
what the [ __ ] man

7664.88 --> 7671.4400000000005
absolutely ridiculous

7667.34 --> 7671.4400000000005
and I mean can an Android nurse

7672.139 --> 7674.7390000000005
like

7675.099 --> 7681.52
clean you up

7678.32 --> 7681.5199999999995
give you a bath

7681.56 --> 7688.159000000001
yeah can Android nurses give all people

7684.619 --> 7691.119
that are crippled a bath can it do that

7688.159 --> 7691.119
do perfumes

7692.119 --> 7698.0
let me guess no it can't because that's

7695.42 --> 7700.659
really [ __ ] difficult

7698.0 --> 7703.52
requires full focused attention and

7700.659 --> 7705.259999999999
overseeing brain

7703.52 --> 7707.3
that you don't do something wrong

7705.26 --> 7711.4400000000005
Overlook something get somebody hurt

7707.3 --> 7713.84
yeah yeah of course a nourished robot

7711.44 --> 7717.98
is not going to be able to clean an old

7713.84 --> 7721.360000000001
person that's [ __ ] yeah so it's not a

7717.98 --> 7724.638999999999
replacement it's just one B replacement

7721.36 --> 7726.799999999999
pre-10 prep replacement what they really

7724.639 --> 7729.86
want is no replacement at all they want

7726.8 --> 7732.1990000000005
all medical care to go away and for you

7729.86 --> 7734.839999999999
to just get sick and die already

7732.199 --> 7737.598999999999
yeah that's the actual plan

7734.84 --> 7741.56
they don't want to improve health care

7737.599 --> 7744.34
they just want you to die already

7741.56 --> 7747.26
yeah and they'll give some

7744.34 --> 7749.42
image like oh it's the future of this it

7747.26 --> 7750.8
isn't it's all death care now they don't

7749.42 --> 7753.34
want you to get better they just want

7750.8 --> 7753.34
you to die

7780.92 --> 7785.42
all right so is everybody preparing for

7783.32 --> 7788.0599999999995
the covet lockdowns that are gonna come

7785.42 --> 7790.4
halfway September

7788.06 --> 7793.46
everybody informed

7790.4 --> 7795.92
everybody have their sources ready

7793.46 --> 7798.139
they're stashes of things that they know

7795.92 --> 7800.84
with absolute certainty they won't be

7798.139 --> 7804.08
able to get after that point

7800.84 --> 7806.4800000000005
everybody preparing properly

7804.08 --> 7809.119
you still got a little over two weeks

7806.48 --> 7811.04
left more lockdown dude you don't even

7809.119 --> 7813.639
[ __ ] know

7811.04 --> 7813.639
hello

7819.98 --> 7825.82
prepare

7821.96 --> 7825.82
before you can't do that anymore

7828.8 --> 7833.26
no Duck toilet paper idiot

7834.34 --> 7840.26
the things you will not be able to get

7839.0 --> 7842.719
yeah

7840.26 --> 7844.52
like medical related things if you just

7842.719 --> 7846.38
had it oh oh yeah for the surgery

7844.52 --> 7849.860000000001
appointment

7846.38 --> 7853.28
in early October late September well

7849.86 --> 7857.32
guess what you're an uninformed idiot

7853.28 --> 7857.32
and you're probably gonna die

7858.34 --> 7863.3
because you're gonna get in there right

7861.32 --> 7865.82
in the middle of the new covet [ __ ]

7863.3 --> 7867.7390000000005
thing and you're lucky if you're not

7865.82 --> 7869.9
gonna end up getting killed by some oh

7867.739 --> 7873.138999999999
it's a new oh it's a slight alteration

7869.9 --> 7874.94
in the procedure oh yes yeah but you're

7873.139 --> 7877.099
not informed

7874.94 --> 7878.839999999999
and you still go to a [ __ ] hospital

7877.099 --> 7880.82
for surgery

7878.84 --> 7882.860000000001
cause you don't know what the [ __ ]

7880.82 --> 7885.739
you're doing you're ignorant and then

7882.86 --> 7886.94
you die that's probably what's gonna

7885.739 --> 7889.218999999999
happen

7886.94 --> 7892.04
yeah if you got yourself scheduled for

7889.219 --> 7894.08
some surgery or whatever the [ __ ] it is

7892.04 --> 7899.06
in a hospital

7894.08 --> 7902.36
after halfway September you're [ __ ]

7899.06 --> 7905.719
you're probably gonna die

7902.36 --> 7907.88
maybe not maybe your hospital is like

7905.719 --> 7910.639
particularly bracing itself not

7907.88 --> 7913.04
cooperating with covet measures that are

7910.639 --> 7914.42
going to roll out but I highly doubt it

7913.04 --> 7918.08
because the hospitals are the first

7914.42 --> 7921.92
thing to fall over to them they all are

7918.08 --> 7923.3
they are arguably the organizers of it

7921.92 --> 7926.1990000000005
right

7923.3 --> 7926.1990000000005
so

7926.54 --> 7931.219
yeah

7928.46 --> 7933.08
prepare

7931.219 --> 7934.52
you know it's coming you know what's

7933.08 --> 7937.58
gonna happen you know what they're gonna

7934.52 --> 7939.679
do you know how idiots are gonna respond

7937.58 --> 7941.96
again and forget like anything ever

7939.679 --> 7945.02
happened in 2022

7941.96 --> 7947.36
2021 they're gonna all just pretend like

7945.02 --> 7951.8
that never happened

7947.36 --> 7956.78
and now you know you can size it up

7951.8 --> 7959.3
so use that time and prepare remember

7956.78 --> 7962.48
what happened the last time when all

7959.3 --> 7964.88
went wrong or went to [ __ ] why did that

7962.48 --> 7967.218999999999
happen because certain things weren't

7964.88 --> 7969.56
possible anymore unavailable or people

7967.219 --> 7971.659
suddenly wouldn't come showing up so if

7969.56 --> 7974.84
there's anything like that that you're

7971.659 --> 7977.48
gonna count on like with everything you

7974.84 --> 7981.079
got or you lose the house well then you

7977.48 --> 7983.48
better get ready to become homeless

7981.079 --> 7984.619
because those things are going to happen

7983.48 --> 7986.48
again

7984.619 --> 7989.54
so now

7986.48 --> 7991.579
with that foreknowledge of how it's

7989.54 --> 7994.46
gonna happen and when it's gonna happen

7991.579 --> 7995.84
you better [ __ ] adapt your plans or

7994.46 --> 7999.02
you're an idiot and you're gonna lose

7995.84 --> 8001.5
everything maybe even your life

7999.02 --> 8001.5
okay

8002.739 --> 8007.598999999999
not a joke

8005.02 --> 8011.7390000000005
this is a rare opportunity where we

8007.599 --> 8014.4400000000005
actually get completely accurate for

8011.739 --> 8016.839999999999
knowledge of what's gonna happen with

8014.44 --> 8019.0
absolute certainty if you don't use it

8016.84 --> 8021.04
if you don't adapt to the foreknowledge

8019.0 --> 8023.52
you deserve everything that's going to

8021.04 --> 8023.5199999999995
come to you

8026.26 --> 8034.96
Get Ready Get sourced get stocked up

8032.38 --> 8036.42
get informed get those people you're

8034.96 --> 8039.04
gonna be

8036.42 --> 8042.04
leaning upon

8039.04 --> 8043.96
informed get them psychologically

8042.04 --> 8047.82
prepared for what's coming

8043.96 --> 8047.82
this is not a drill

8053.44 --> 8058.419999999999
kill those kids yeah fiber outside no

8056.5 --> 8062.28
and they're very well aware of it too

8058.42 --> 8065.8
fibroids so I mean those people that

8062.28 --> 8068.5
negligently let that all happen means

8065.8 --> 8070.84
clearly with foreknowledge I mean they

8068.5 --> 8072.639
didn't freaking even trim nature they

8070.84 --> 8076.360000000001
didn't even

8072.639 --> 8079.3
do minimal fire damage control

8076.36 --> 8081.839999999999
okay for a long time

8079.3 --> 8083.5
you don't do that without

8081.84 --> 8087.159000000001
knowing

8083.5 --> 8092.52
of what the risk will be so it was a

8087.159 --> 8092.5199999999995
conspiracy of yeah of devasai

8094.96 --> 8100.7390000000005
for like known

8097.78 --> 8100.739
neglect

8101.679 --> 8107.4400000000005
with a plan it is a plan it's a

8105.159 --> 8109.36
conspired plan to kill those people

8107.44 --> 8112.419999999999
provably

8109.36 --> 8115.78
and they will all end up in jail if not

8112.42 --> 8118.8
executed and like this is gonna happen

8115.78 --> 8118.8
it is gonna happen

8120.639 --> 8125.86
what type of food am I stuck I'm not

8122.98 --> 8127.9
stocking up any food speeder how the

8125.86 --> 8130.0
[ __ ] am I gonna stock it up with what

8127.9 --> 8132.94
money

8130.0 --> 8135.04
what just make my fridge a little Fuller

8132.94 --> 8137.44
well that's gonna be done in a week and

8135.04 --> 8140.94
then I just have to buy new ones why the

8137.44 --> 8140.94
hell would I need to stock up food

8142.54 --> 8146.04
that doesn't work for me

8146.199 --> 8150.579
yeah

8147.46 --> 8156.36
cool fit lockdowns doesn't mean stores

8150.579 --> 8159.28
close what it means is restaurants close

8156.36 --> 8162.5199999999995
whining about masks

8159.28 --> 8166.119
some really [ __ ] up Black Rock

8162.52 --> 8168.639
Vanguard Mega corporations might say you

8166.119 --> 8171.579
can't get in without a QR code or a

8168.639 --> 8174.34
vaccine or something right that's what's

8171.579 --> 8176.44
gonna happen yeah I didn't have those

8174.34 --> 8178.900000000001
issues last year and I'm not gonna have

8176.44 --> 8182.259999999999
those issues this year because the

8178.9 --> 8184.619
supermarket that I go to is against all

8182.26 --> 8184.619000000001
of it

8186.46 --> 8192.16
they're against all of that

8189.699 --> 8194.979
they're not going along they're doing

8192.16 --> 8197.74
the minimum to have the least Financial

8194.979 --> 8201.46
damage from not complying with all of it

8197.74 --> 8204.88
yeah they don't force you to wear masks

8201.46 --> 8207.46
the employees wear them for because the

8204.88 --> 8210.759999999998
insurer like demands it that's it

8207.46 --> 8214.719
nothing else nothing else yeah

8210.76 --> 8216.939
yeah so I don't have to stock up on food

8214.719 --> 8219.58
it wouldn't help anyway because it's

8216.939 --> 8222.04
just gonna run out

8219.58 --> 8223.66
or spoil or something so there's no

8222.04 --> 8227.019
stocking up I don't have money for that

8223.66 --> 8229.119999999999
and I don't have any direct need of it

8227.019 --> 8231.7
if it's going to be gone then stocking

8229.12 --> 8235.740000000002
up isn't Gonna Save me because it will

8231.7 --> 8235.740000000002
just run out and then it's gone still

8238.0 --> 8242.26
all right

8239.58 --> 8245.559
don't mind yo that's

8242.26 --> 8246.599
sure us it's not hard but it is weak and

8245.559 --> 8249.938999999998
it is

8246.599 --> 8252.880000000001
complying to covet measures which is

8249.939 --> 8255.880000000001
treason to your nation

8252.88 --> 8255.88
unconditionally

8256.179 --> 8261.099
so if you're caught if there's camera

8258.7 --> 8263.08
footage of people wearing masks that

8261.099 --> 8264.599
means

8263.08 --> 8267.519
score one

8264.599 --> 8271.74
for Bill Gates and fauci

8267.519 --> 8275.800000000001
and that means oh they get to proceed

8271.74 --> 8279.039999999999
this percentage of the plan because this

8275.8 --> 8281.139
percentage of the people actually comply

8279.04 --> 8283.5
to the measures for whatever reason yeah

8281.139 --> 8286.598999999998
that's how the game works

8283.5 --> 8290.76
complying with any covet measures is

8286.599 --> 8293.559
probably a direct

8290.76 --> 8297.34
betrayal of your nation

8293.559 --> 8301.719
because there's direct consequences for

8297.34 --> 8304.359
your nation for you complying see

8301.719 --> 8307.419999999998
you have to be aware of that you have to

8304.359 --> 8309.58
prepare for that

8307.42 --> 8311.139
the biggest struggle is not oh I might

8309.58 --> 8313.78
run out of this or that no the biggest

8311.139 --> 8316.42
struggle is you might run out of

8313.78 --> 8318.460000000001
people's sanities that are gonna go

8316.42 --> 8320.32
along because they just don't want to

8318.46 --> 8323.32
think about it anymore it's like they

8320.32 --> 8326.139
like if you don't allow me to wear the

8323.32 --> 8328.0
mask I will [ __ ] kill myself

8326.139 --> 8330.399
that sort of [ __ ]

8328.0 --> 8333.88
that's what you should be preparing for

8330.399 --> 8337.119999999999
for people that are just like don't tell

8333.88 --> 8339.699999999999
me anything I just want to go along and

8337.12 --> 8342.160000000002
not think about anything if you try to

8339.7 --> 8344.139000000001
take force me to take my mask off I will

8342.16 --> 8347.2
[ __ ] kill myself

8344.139 --> 8349.719
yeah that's the direction of the crazy

8347.2 --> 8352.300000000001
[ __ ] that you should be expecting not

8349.719 --> 8354.399
running out of food it's running out of

8352.3 --> 8356.438999999998
people's sanity that you should be

8354.399 --> 8358.719
expecting and what you should be

8356.439 --> 8360.880000000001
preparing for to counter that because

8358.719 --> 8363.639
the more people that give into these

8360.88 --> 8366.039999999999
measures the more [ __ ] doomed your

8363.639 --> 8368.619999999999
nation is

8366.04 --> 8370.979000000001
literally

8368.62 --> 8373.42
this is not like a

8370.979 --> 8376.0
metaphorical thing anymore or a

8373.42 --> 8378.639
comparison no

8376.0 --> 8382.42
every individual that complies in any

8378.639 --> 8385.3
way will add to the percentage of Doom

8382.42 --> 8388.54
to your nation worldwide no matter where

8385.3 --> 8391.779999999999
it is any numpty that for any reason

8388.54 --> 8394.899000000001
goes along with these measures for any

8391.78 --> 8396.76
reason we'll add to the Doom of your

8394.899 --> 8399.58
nation

8396.76 --> 8402.42
that's how it works

8399.58 --> 8402.42
prepare

8403.42 --> 8407.22
yeah use peer pressure

8408.46 --> 8413.919999999998
they're not allowed to comply

8412.12 --> 8416.62
it's treachery

8413.92 --> 8419.68
yeah it's treachery to comply with those

8416.62 --> 8422.979000000001
measures treachery

8419.68 --> 8424.06
a treachery to a level where 500 years

8422.979 --> 8426.938999999998
ago

8424.06 --> 8428.38
the The Village would garate you for

8426.939 --> 8433.12
doing that

8428.38 --> 8436.96
yeah that treachery don't do don't do it

8433.12 --> 8439.54
don't allow anybody to comply with the

8436.96 --> 8442.599999999999
measures because when they do they

8439.54 --> 8445.060000000001
literally attack you

8442.6 --> 8448.300000000001
they attack you they attack your nation

8445.06 --> 8451.859
there's consequences for them doing it

8448.3 --> 8451.858999999999
that will be on you

8451.899 --> 8454.8
do you understand

8470.56 --> 8472.92
right

8478.06 --> 8484.26
yeah don't tell me why you have to do

8480.819 --> 8488.22
anything like that's

8484.26 --> 8488.22
yeah there's no excuse

8492.16 --> 8496.0
me fancy finishing off your mortgage I

8494.5 --> 8498.64
don't even know why the [ __ ] you got a

8496.0 --> 8500.819
mortgage at this time in a period like

8498.64 --> 8500.819
this

8503.08 --> 8507.28
but

8504.28 --> 8509.859
yeah you go ahead just know that oh I

8507.28 --> 8512.140000000001

get multiple people of your country

8512.14 --> 8517.42
killed because you just had to didn't

8514.12 --> 8519.58
you yeah that that's how this works for

8517.42 --> 8522.16
any reason

8519.58 --> 8525.16
I mean any person at this point that has

8522.16 --> 8529.8
any [ __ ] mortgage or loan at a bank

8525.16 --> 8529.8
is [ __ ] out of their mind

8531.52 --> 8537.0
oh what I don't know any other way to

8533.56 --> 8537.0
get it yeah then don't get it

8537.58 --> 8541.78
because you're out of your [ __ ] mind

8539.68 --> 8544.359
oh but I just had to have it you know oh

8541.78 --> 8547.0

8547.0 --> 8551.56
[ __ ] little room and I don't have a

8549.22 --> 8554.199999999999
mortgage so I'm not gonna be forced to

8551.56 --> 8556.72
take a [ __ ] shot that could kill me

8554.2 --> 8561.640000000001
or wear a mask yeah

8556.72 --> 8564.96
and it's worth it poverty is worth it to

8561.64 --> 8564.96
not comply

8574.12 --> 8582.060000000001
let those comply die

8577.78 --> 8582.060000000001
they had to well then you had to die

8582.399 --> 8587.08
I'm not directly attacking you here Oz

8584.8 --> 8589.479
even though you've kind of well put

8587.08 --> 8591.46
yourself up for that by saying all these

8589.479 --> 8594.699999999999
things

8591.46 --> 8596.619999999999
but yeah if you have to well then you

8594.7 --> 8599.62
have to pray the price for that thing

8596.62 --> 8601.18
that you that you thought you had to do

8599.62 --> 8604.5
you have to comply you had no choice

8601.18 --> 8608.1
well then you're gonna pay the price

8604.5 --> 8608.1
you're gonna be sorry

8608.5 --> 8610.96
yeah

8609.64 --> 8613.899
so

8610.96 --> 8615.699999999999

8622.359 --> 8627.28
shot to us

8624.52 --> 8629.5
you had to what what you're still going

8627.28 --> 8631.479000000001
to do it because you're a mortgage

8629.5 --> 8632.56
yeah it's a good chance there's a good

8631.479 --> 8635.619999999999
chance that they're gonna like

8632.56 --> 8638.439
immediately up it

8635.62 --> 8641.140000000001
they're gonna just try it and hey

8638.439 --> 8644.380000000001
gigantic businesses will suddenly

8641.14 --> 8646.3
completely go bust because they're gonna

8644.38 --> 8649.3
try to force all the employees to get

8646.3 --> 8651.58
vaccinated all that and those most of

8649.3 --> 8654.099999999999
those employees don't want to die and

8651.58 --> 8656.74
they've seen people die and they know

8654.1 --> 8658.84
that it's because of those shots

8656.74 --> 8660.52
and they're not gonna do it because they

8658.84 --> 8663.1
already planned for this because they

8660.52 --> 8665.68
actually thought ahead how this works

8663.1 --> 8667.54
listen to forums and other people that

8665.68 --> 8670.899
study this thing and how to deal with it

8667.54 --> 8674.800000000001
and they know you yeah [ __ ] the job

8670.899 --> 8676.539999999999
then that business goes bust then oh

8674.8 --> 8679.42
you're wrong we have to do this well

8676.54 --> 8683.580000000002
then go [ __ ] yourself

8679.42 --> 8683.58
and go bust you [ __ ] [ __ ]

8685.24 --> 8690.039999999999
and then we'll start our own business

8687.22 --> 8694.8
without some corporate [ __ ] telling

8690.04 --> 8694.800000000001
us to comply with eugenesis measures

8694.899 --> 8699.819
start your own business or just take it

8697.24 --> 8701.5
out just steal steam [ __ ] business

8699.819 --> 8703.72

get the workers together that you know

8703.72 --> 8709.358999999999
your colleagues and just say hey this

8707.08 --> 8711.1

8709.359 --> 8714.300000000001
get his kill

8711.1 --> 8714.300000000001
let's just

8714.42 --> 8721.0
take our resignations and then like

8718.0 --> 8723.88
parallel construct this very job and

8721.0 --> 8725.979
like just steal it from them

8723.88 --> 8728.979
like it

8725.979 --> 8731.019999999999
a a workers group not a management

8728.979 --> 8733.72
system a workers group that's just gonna

8731.02 --> 8734.68
compete suddenly with that monolithic

8733.72 --> 8736.66
company

8734.68 --> 8739.18
just take it they're gonna go bust

8736.66 --> 8742.0
because all their workers are gonna die

8739.18 --> 8745.56
and leave

8742.0 --> 8745.56
just take over the business

8746.859 --> 8751.18
like yeah we're we're out of here you

uh I'll see you at the unemployment

8753.7 --> 8758.02
office the next year

8755.74 --> 8761.02

8758.02 --> 8764.220000000001
take vaccines yeah

8761.02 --> 8764.220000000001
that's how you do it

8765.88 --> 8769.779999999999
why are companies trying to kill their

8767.68 --> 8772.06
employees

8769.78 --> 8774.399000000001
because that's the orders that's the

8772.06 --> 8776.619999999999
thing you do now because this is the

8774.399 --> 8779.019999999999
corporatocracy and BlackRock and

8776.62 --> 8779.979000000001
Vanguard which own the vast majority of

8779.02 --> 8783.460000000001
everything

8779.979 --> 8785.858999999999
that's their motto that's what they do

8783.46 --> 8787.899
yeah

8785.859 --> 8789.939
it just manage everything until there's

8787.899 --> 8792.16
a plan and then it's like yeah now now

8789.939 --> 8794.56
we're all going to add to mind

8792.16 --> 8796.359
controlling you to get you to kill

8794.56 --> 8798.46
yourself

8796.359 --> 8800.2
oh we're gonna just burn down this whole

8798.46 --> 8802.24
place

8800.2 --> 8804.1
and then buy it up cheaply and then we

8802.24 --> 8806.199999999999
got more

8804.1 --> 8809.08
touch it

8806.2 --> 8812.68
it's all power it's power of

8809.08 --> 8816.46
Corporations soulless greedy money

8812.68 --> 8819.28
sucking machines over rights of the

8816.46 --> 8821.319
people over Nations

8819.28 --> 8824.319000000001
that's what this is is a cartographer

8821.319 --> 8824.319
corporatocracy

8824.56 --> 8830.56
technocracy

8827.319 --> 8834.399
it's a hollowed more or less Godless

8830.56 --> 8838.26
zombie that's only driven by greed

8834.399 --> 8843.039999999999
that is trying to consume and disable

8838.26 --> 8845.74
the rights of people and their Nations

8843.04 --> 8847.18
it's globalism fundamentally corporate

8845.74 --> 8849.76
globalism

8847.18 --> 8852.7
and for corporate globalism people

8849.76 --> 8855.819
aren't Nations they're not something to

8852.7 --> 8857.92
be protected they're all Commodities and

8855.819 --> 8860.92
they're becoming outdated commodities

8857.92 --> 8863.319
for their own selfish purposes of making

8860.92 --> 8865.6
more profit

8863.319 --> 8868.539999999999
so they're becoming more and more

8865.6 --> 8870.220000000001
designated for Destruction and

8868.54 --> 8871.960000000001
replacement

8870.22 --> 8876.24
and that's

8871.96 --> 8880.72
why the mega corporations are

8876.24 --> 8883.06
prioritizing working along with programs

8880.72 --> 8887.019999999999
that get people killed

8883.06 --> 8889.3
and that's the reality we live in

8887.02 --> 8892.300000000001
hope that answers your question

8889.3 --> 8892.3
ER

8895.899 --> 8900.64
yeah

8897.28 --> 8904.0
because but let's get to a more direct

8900.64 --> 8907.72
approach why do like

8904.0 --> 8909.52
Corporation owners managers why do they

8907.72 --> 8910.599999999999
make their employees take the vaccine

8909.52 --> 8912.880000000001
well

8910.6 --> 8914.08
it would be because they get massive

8912.88 --> 8915.399
bonuses

8914.08 --> 8919.38
[Music]

8915.399 --> 8922.0
like they directly get money cash

8919.38 --> 8924.64
from the mega corporate from the vaccine

8922.0 --> 8926.5
corporations they just get bribed to

8924.64 --> 8929.319
force their workers to take it or be

8926.5 --> 8934.06
fired they literally get bribes

8929.319 --> 8936.34
yeah politicians literally get bribes

8934.06 --> 8938.619999999999
from the corporations I mean it's even

8936.34 --> 8941.859
traceable they don't even make an

8938.62 --> 8944.62
attempt to hide it it's just money Bloom

8941.859 --> 8947.380000000001
oh oh look he's cooperating now why

8944.62 --> 8950.5
would that be yeah it's just Direct

8947.38 --> 8952.779999999999
Corporate bribing

8950.5 --> 8955.24
you get giant amount of money if you

8952.78 --> 8957.42
force your employees to to take the

8955.24 --> 8957.42
product

8961.06 --> 8965.979
right and as an alternative if you don't

8964.3 --> 8968.38
comply well then you're probably gonna

8965.979 --> 8970.42
have to pay some fines for not complying

8968.38 --> 8972.938999999998
with that right

8970.42 --> 8974.979
but they definitely do make money it's

8972.939 --> 8976.899
not just to avoid fines that they do

8974.979 --> 8979.06
such stuff

8976.899 --> 8982.84
a lot of them do make money there is

8979.06 --> 8984.399
like bribes to get your workers to

8982.84 --> 8987.72
to comply

8984.399 --> 8987.72
that exists

9003.54 --> 9008.640000000001
okay five roads

9006.54 --> 9010.560000000001
your boss well your boss is just a

9008.64 --> 9011.76
[ __ ] idiot but you shouldn't have

9010.56 --> 9015.479
done that

9011.76 --> 9016.859
I mean bosses like that it's like you

9015.479 --> 9018.66
should applaud them and you should like

9016.859 --> 9020.04
encourage them like yeah man you should

9018.66 --> 9022.619999999999
take the shot didn't you know there's

9020.04 --> 9025.62
like a booster next month

9022.62 --> 9028.02
you need to get those that's what I

9025.62 --> 9030.240000000002
would do if I had like a vaccination

9028.02 --> 9032.76
Enthusiast let's say like yeah

9030.24 --> 9035.16
like no no I'm not taking it because I'd

9032.76 --> 9038.939
much rather get covered and die

9035.16 --> 9040.619999999999
but I know I agree with you yes if I

9038.939 --> 9044.52
were you

9040.62 --> 9046.560000000001
I definitely take every single shot the

9044.52 --> 9048.720000000001
the second they come out so yeah I

9046.56 --> 9051.42
applaud you for for that

9048.72 --> 9053.88
definitely go get it yeah that that's

9051.42 --> 9055.92
what I would have done

9053.88 --> 9058.56
huh

9055.92 --> 9061.02
because what the [ __ ] you gotta do what

9058.56 --> 9063.84
you gonna do boss you're gonna say how

9061.02 --> 9066.359
dare you what I literally encouraged you

9063.84 --> 9068.1
I told you that I agree that I really

9066.359 --> 9070.439
think you should do that

9068.1 --> 9072.18
why

9070.439 --> 9074.1
what are you gonna do

9072.18 --> 9075.960000000001
oh you got it recorded oh you're gonna

9074.1 --> 9078.359
send it to your yeah good luck with that

9075.96 --> 9080.58
because everything I said is literally

9078.359 --> 9084.24
an encouragement oh you didn't like the

9080.58 --> 9086.88
tone of it well that doesn't hold up it

9084.24 --> 9089.42
recorded a lot now doesn't it

9086.88 --> 9089.42
huh

9089.46 --> 9095.399
so you just go and take those shots man

9092.24 --> 9097.14
go ahead

9095.399 --> 9101.16
yeah

9097.14 --> 9103.38
that's what I would have done but hey

9101.16 --> 9107.66
what it should have never really had a

9103.38 --> 9107.66
job so never really had that opportunity

9108.899 --> 9112.74
you have a case of bad temper okay fair

9111.06 --> 9114.539999999999
enough fiber oats I know what that's

9112.74 --> 9116.699999999999
like but

9114.54 --> 9119.6
still

9116.7 --> 9119.6
think about it

9120.24 --> 9124.199999999999
think about it

9122.7 --> 9126.66
what I just said

9124.2 --> 9128.58
think about it carefully

9126.66 --> 9130.439
now don't be a stick in the mud like oh

9128.58 --> 9133.5
no there's only one way to respond and

9130.439 --> 9136.56
that's like there no no no no no you can

9133.5 --> 9140.34
do exactly what I just said

9136.56 --> 9142.979
pick why because you know it you know it

9140.34 --> 9146.16
you've mastered this knowledge so you

9142.979 --> 9150.899
can do that you don't just have to

9146.16 --> 9153.72
do the I'm angry routine

9150.899 --> 9156.66
because they can use that yeah there's

9153.72 --> 9160.199999999999
something that's officially registrable

9156.66 --> 9162.72
for a boss to size that up with

9160.2 --> 9168.359
employees the aggression level like they

9162.72 --> 9172.5
can illegally use that so don't

9168.359 --> 9175.62
do what I do you encourage them

9172.5 --> 9177.359
like manically like huh wow that's so

9175.62 --> 9178.800000000001
great man yeah I heard there's like a

9177.359 --> 9179.7
new booster shot like are you gonna get

9178.8 --> 9182.519999999999
it

9179.7 --> 9184.26
I'm I'm gonna call you up as soon as I

9182.52 --> 9187.380000000001
hear that it's out okay

9184.26 --> 9189.300000000001
is that cool with you

9187.38 --> 9190.5
yeah look I'm straight in the eye when

9189.3 --> 9193.438999999998
you say it

9190.5 --> 9194.58
shake their hand enthusiastically

9193.439 --> 9197.52
do it

9194.58 --> 9200.64
[ __ ] do it man

9197.52 --> 9201.78
see what happens

9200.64 --> 9205.74
yeah

9201.78 --> 9208.800000000001
they can't do anything against you if

9205.74 --> 9211.08
you do that and it's very satisfying it

9208.8 --> 9215.16
will give your aggression

9211.08 --> 9220.1
a bit of attention release

9215.16 --> 9220.1
and won't get you fired for aggression

9220.38 --> 9223.759999999998
they'll just freak them out

9232.8 --> 9239.0
I'm in a dreaded diabetics group okay

9235.319 --> 9239.0
blue pill Evolution well good on you

9239.16 --> 9243.619999999999
yes

9241.02 --> 9243.62
yeah

9247.62 --> 9252.0
foreign

9249.92 --> 9255.960000000001
I really hope you're going to keep that

9252.0 --> 9255.96
in mind next time because

9258.479 --> 9267.42
you don't want your character traits

9262.26 --> 9269.58
to just be prioritized when they lead to

9267.42 --> 9272.899
losses

9269.58 --> 9272.899
you shouldn't do that

9274.38 --> 9278.938999999998
character Court shouldn't a character

9276.78 --> 9281.880000000001
Quirk shouldn't be costing you your

9278.939 --> 9284.18
livelihood okay it shouldn't it never

9281.88 --> 9284.179999999998
should

9284.22 --> 9286.699999999999
thank you

9287.52 --> 9293.24
but you want to fight well then go fight

9289.92 --> 9293.24
but don't do it with your boss

9295.26 --> 9300.319
just try a boxing ball or whatever

9314.49 --> 9317.61
[Music]

9319.96 --> 9323.119999999999
[Music]

9334.979 --> 9339.0
right anyway I hope you're all enjoyed

9336.84 --> 9341.939
the show

9339.0 --> 9343.859
to be fair I'm not entirely sure for how

9341.939 --> 9345.66
long I can even keep up the early bird

9343.859 --> 9347.939
show

9345.66 --> 9350.7
because there are some laws that are

9347.939 --> 9353.880000000001
that might be forced through

9350.7 --> 9355.140000000001
where literally the Netherlands might be

9353.88 --> 9357.24
forcing

9355.14 --> 9359.22
through the government forcing big Tech

9357.24 --> 9362.34
to censor

9359.22 --> 9365.279999999999
anything that is conspiratorial

9362.34 --> 9367.02
which would basically Google wouldn't

9365.28 --> 9370.380000000001
even agree to that because that like

9367.02 --> 9372.720000000001
severely cuts into their profit margins

9370.38 --> 9375.06
it really will

9372.72 --> 9376.858999999999
but so they're probably like we will

9375.06 --> 9378.899
probably have freaking Google on our

9376.859 --> 9380.52
side against this

9378.899 --> 9381.599999999999
but that doesn't mean that it can't

9380.52 --> 9384.960000000001
happen

9381.6 --> 9386.640000000001
so and yeah if that law actually goes

9384.96 --> 9388.919999999998
through and Google actually cooperates

9386.64 --> 9392.58
well then the likelihood that I can

9388.92 --> 9395.819
continue my show doing what I do

9392.58 --> 9398.16
it like decreases dramatically

9395.819 --> 9400.74
so I'm giving you a heads up I'm not

9398.16 --> 9402.72
sure if I'll be able to continue my show

9400.74 --> 9406.1
for much longer

9402.72 --> 9410.64
like these laws are about to go into

9406.1 --> 9411.54
yeah they're about to get through I

9410.64 --> 9414.24
think

9411.54 --> 9416.939
like at the end of this month

9414.24 --> 9418.439
I'm a bit late announcing this but just

9416.939 --> 9419.76
because I've just been reading about it

9418.439 --> 9421.68
so

9419.76 --> 9424.02
our entire

9421.68 --> 9426.359
free media and social media in the

9424.02 --> 9429.84
Netherlands might about to be completely

9426.359 --> 9430.979000000001
stifled really badly like unheard of it

9429.84 --> 9435.14
would be

9430.979 --> 9435.14
unheard of since World War II

9435.78 --> 9440.52
if that would happen

9438.54 --> 9443.720000000001
and I've been trying to push it they've

9440.52 --> 9447.0
been just like Pro censorship just like

9443.72 --> 9450.0
shamelessly Pro censorship

9447.0 --> 9453.0
so we'll be disgusting communist

9450.0 --> 9455.34
mentality it's like no

9453.0 --> 9456.6
censorship is okay

9455.34 --> 9459.359
if

9456.6 --> 9463.2
those censored are like against the

9459.359 --> 9467.1
party narrative that's literally

9463.2 --> 9468.54
what they even like admit on [ __ ]

9467.1 --> 9471.300000000001
television now

9468.54 --> 9473.04
yeah they're disgusting [ __ ]

9471.3 --> 9476.039999999999
communists

9473.04 --> 9476.04
disgusting

9479.34 --> 9486.3
they're very [ __ ] few things that I

9482.64 --> 9488.599999999999
hate less that I hate more I mean than

9486.3 --> 9488.599999999999
this

9489.18 --> 9494.84
like Communists that literally like

9492.899 --> 9498.72
censor

9494.84 --> 9500.64
hypocritically like the party narrative

9498.72 --> 9502.74
is good if you're not against if you're

9500.64 --> 9503.88
against a party narrative you you can't

9502.74 --> 9507.539999999999
speak

9503.88 --> 9510.779999999999
there's very very little in this world

9507.54 --> 9513.62
that I hate more

9510.78 --> 9513.62
than that

9520.62 --> 9525.0
what it does to me is it makes me

9522.479 --> 9527.399
imagine like how far could I actually

9525.0 --> 9531.859
take torture of evil

9527.399 --> 9531.858999999999
how far could I actually take it

9533.16 --> 9537.78
because I can describe things for sure I

9535.8 --> 9538.92
can be very horrific in my descriptions

9537.78 --> 9541.5
but like

9538.92 --> 9543.18
how far could it actually do it if it

9541.5 --> 9547.52
turned out that that is it

9543.18 --> 9547.52
like could I could could I go

9548.939 --> 9554.220000000001
what's his name again

9551.16 --> 9556.56
can could I go for Pinochet

9554.22 --> 9558.96
could I do that

9556.56 --> 9560.64
I genuinely wonder that because I get

9558.96 --> 9562.08
the feeling more and more that I'm gonna

9560.64 --> 9564.06
be

9562.08 --> 9567.42
like

9564.06 --> 9569.76
just tasks to do something like that

9567.42 --> 9571.68
about these people these [ __ ]

9569.76 --> 9574.08
communists

9571.68 --> 9576.0
that just won't go away they won't stop

9574.08 --> 9578.16
trying to mind control everybody with

9576.0 --> 9580.2
their lies even though everybody's just

9578.16 --> 9582.06
catching on

9580.2 --> 9585.6
like we're gonna have to do something

9582.06 --> 9589.46
about the [ __ ] communists

9585.6 --> 9589.460000000001
something pretty damn dramatic

9595.68 --> 9600.479000000001
yeah

9597.06 --> 9601.319
I mean this crazy ass government here is

9600.479 --> 9604.8
just

9601.319 --> 9606.539999999999
they're like begging to be just utterly

9604.8 --> 9610.74
annihilated

9606.54 --> 9613.859
[ __ ] waving freaking Ukrainian flags

9610.74 --> 9617.46
at their gov at our government buildings

9613.859 --> 9619.68
okay they actually do that now

9617.46 --> 9621.679999999998
I mean

9619.68 --> 9621.68
I

9622.08 --> 9627.42
I'm I'm getting like irrational

9624.479 --> 9630.38
fantasies of like come on man come on

9627.42 --> 9632.22
Putin can't you just send one

9630.38 --> 9633.619999999999
hypersonic

9632.22 --> 9637.019999999999
supposed

9633.62 --> 9639.359
nuclear missile like a big explosion one

9637.02 --> 9641.819000000001
that's hyper can't you just [ __ ] blow

9639.359 --> 9645.479000000001
this government up can't you just

9641.819 --> 9648.3
like precise targeting like these

9645.479 --> 9650.099999999999
[ __ ] communist people can't you just

9648.3 --> 9652.019999999999
help us out with that

9650.1 --> 9653.7
but then I realized like no they

9652.02 --> 9656.819000000001
definitely can't

9653.7 --> 9658.800000000001
like it's not just one if it was just

9656.819 --> 9660.96
one man keeping it all like the way it

9658.8 --> 9662.938999999998
is then they would probably ever to do

9660.96 --> 9665.16
something about it but it isn't it's a

9662.939 --> 9668.460000000001
whole bunch of people it's a whole

9665.16 --> 9671.64
[ __ ] category group now we have a

9668.46 --> 9674.938999999998
percentage of [ __ ] communist Fanatics

9671.64 --> 9677.34
in our [ __ ] little country

9674.939 --> 9680.52
and it's in government it's a whole

9677.34 --> 9682.68
group of people it's not just a handful

9680.52 --> 9686.460000000001
of people

9682.68 --> 9688.939
we got a big big problem in the

9686.46 --> 9688.938999999998
Netherlands

9692.3 --> 9696.979
hundreds if not thousands of people

9712.439 --> 9717.26
it's easy then into a few more now

9725.28 --> 9731.640000000001
no I don't no

9728.16 --> 9734.72
no this [ __ ] coming like

9731.64 --> 9734.72
it doesn't work

9735.12 --> 9741.240000000002
like imprisoning a communist doesn't do

9738.3 --> 9743.279999999999
anything yeah you have to kill them this

9741.24 --> 9747.119999999999
is the one [ __ ] thing that Pinochet

9743.28 --> 9750.0
actually gets once you're a communist

9747.12 --> 9752.399000000001
you are unrecoverable a communist could

9750.0 --> 9753.66
be 50 years in jail and then when he

9752.399 --> 9756.899
comes out

9753.66 --> 9759.84
he will still [ __ ] start another

9756.899 --> 9761.76
Marxist Communist Revolution because

9759.84 --> 9765.42
they never stop

9761.76 --> 9766.62
the only way to make them stop is to

9765.42 --> 9770.899
kill them

9766.62 --> 9773.819000000001
that's Communists they're arguably

9770.899 --> 9778.019999999999
literally possessed by the devil and

9773.819 --> 9780.18
never let go it never lets go

9778.02 --> 9784.34
once you're in it

9780.18 --> 9784.34
it's like it doesn't let you go

9787.5 --> 9793.56
so no I'm I'm really not for oh just put

9791.16 --> 9795.24
them on a prison no no because what if

9793.56 --> 9798.359
they escape

9795.24 --> 9801.119999999999
yeah how are you gonna feel about it

9798.359 --> 9803.819
then when they [ __ ] escape and start

9801.12 --> 9806.34
doing it again oh another country yeah

9803.819 --> 9808.68
oh well because nothing we can do about

9806.34 --> 9811.319
that now oh guess what yeah yeah 20

9808.68 --> 9812.819
years another generation guess what

9811.319 --> 9817.019999999999
they're gonna be doing they're gonna

9812.819 --> 9818.399
come after you again because they never

9817.02 --> 9821.220000000001
stop

9818.399 --> 9824.0
until they are all

9821.22 --> 9824.0
dead

9824.58 --> 9827.18
yeah

9828.02 --> 9833.12
Communists never stop until they're dead

9834.06 --> 9840.14
putting them in jail

9836.22 --> 9840.14
is a waste of resources

9877.19 --> 9880.299
[Applause]

9883.32 --> 9888.989
[Music]

9884.35 --> 9888.989

9901.8 --> 9904.759999999998
gonna call it now

9906.18 --> 9912.720000000001

today another one is born it's called

9946.62 --> 9952.439

very interesting you talk to that young

10078.14 --> 10083.24
guy

10079.359 --> 10085.220000000001
very interesting conversation I listened

10083.24 --> 10087.56

10085.22 --> 10090.8
that out if you haven't already

10087.56 --> 10092.539999999999
Dr Shiva is in my recommended list this

10090.8 --> 10096.199999999999
is his last video

10092.54 --> 10098.6
I think it is this is the last one

10096.2 --> 10102.640000000001
young people have nothing to lose but to

10098.6 --> 10102.640000000001

this is the Dr Shiva video from recent

10122.12 --> 10127.240000000002

10132.319 --> 10137.539999999999
Dr Shiva through the pointlesso brutal

10143.0 --> 10147.62

10145.22 --> 10151.358999999999
it's five routes take it easy

10147.62 --> 10151.359
don't make sure you don't get hurt

10154.04 --> 10158.960000000001
because if you give in to anger too much

10156.68 --> 10161.0
that's what's gonna happen so be aware

10158.96 --> 10163.519999999999
of that

10161.0 --> 10166.399
and yeah have a good day man don't

10163.52 --> 10169.6
don't let it don't let your anger ruin

10166.399 --> 10169.599999999999
it oh yeah

10177.08 --> 10181.22
you like the clever titles then thanks

10179.0 --> 10183.68
yeah I'm very happy with it

10181.22 --> 10186.26
I still can remember like

10183.68 --> 10188.84
two years ago where it's like oh I don't

10186.26 --> 10190.7
know what a title title

10188.84 --> 10191.960000000001
then I don't have a title for a week and

10190.7 --> 10194.18
then it's like oh I got a really good

10191.96 --> 10195.679999999998
title idea I was like oh wow I've got a

10194.18 --> 10198.439
title idea

10195.68 --> 10201.62
no that'll last me another week

10198.439 --> 10204.439
and now it's like I'm almost shocked if

10201.62 --> 10207.62
I can't think of a name for my show

10204.439 --> 10209.899
I'm almost shocked

10207.62 --> 10211.1
what pisses you up probably the covet

10209.899 --> 10213.92
measures

10211.1 --> 10216.62
us and the forecast that they're coming

10213.92 --> 10218.479
back fiber routes is probably pissed off

10216.62 --> 10221.2
over that that is going to have to face

10218.479 --> 10221.199999999999
that [ __ ] again

10222.26 --> 10226.0
I hope you're all taking note

10249.26 --> 10253.76
just got back up to dinner

10251.78 --> 10256.460000000001
what's the talk well why don't you read

10253.76 --> 10257.54
the title turret and find out what's the

10256.46 --> 10262.72
talk

10257.54 --> 10262.720000000001
yeah behold the title and be dazzled

10291.56 --> 10294.399
hmm

10299.319 --> 10303.38
right but I think I'm gonna maneuver

10301.76 --> 10304.819
towards rounding out I've been doing

10303.38 --> 10306.319
three hours

10304.819 --> 10308.0
I don't know whether he's getting kind

10306.319 --> 10311.56
of nice but I also still have the stuff

10308.0 --> 10311.56
to get out for a bit of groceries

10312.02 --> 10317.24
maybe if I got a PayPal or something I

10314.84 --> 10319.460000000001
might go a bit longer

10317.24 --> 10321.64
I've really been getting any for half a

10319.46 --> 10321.64
week

10321.68 --> 10327.56
and yes I'm sorry I'm never going to

10323.899 --> 10330.92
completely stop complaining about that

10327.56 --> 10333.01
maybe if I got like 500 Euros in one day

10330.92 --> 10336.209
then I'll stop complaining about it

10333.01 --> 10336.209
[Music]

10339.439 --> 10342.74
all right what the weather is good

10341.84 --> 10346.12
enough

10342.74 --> 10346.119999999999
better son at least

10355.279 --> 10359.439
so he had a very elaborate chart today

10365.2 --> 10372.740000000002
started about with Kitty talk okay cat

10368.96 --> 10373.759999999998
is always sleeping over there now

10372.74 --> 10376.1
um

10373.76 --> 10378.380000000001
the cat basically has four different

10376.1 --> 10381.859
spots where he likes to sleep

10378.38 --> 10383.778999999999
including my sock basket on my bed

10381.859 --> 10386.380000000001
over there in the corner and on the box

10383.779 --> 10386.380000000001
over there

10386.479 --> 10389.08
hmm

10389.72 --> 10395.479
right then referencing the pastrami

10392.479 --> 10398.14
debates from yesterday on fed the last

10395.479 --> 10398.14
after show

10398.18 --> 10401.960000000001
was incredibly long total Flat Earth

10400.88 --> 10404.479
debates

10401.96 --> 10407.0
like six hours or more

10404.479 --> 10409.64
then I showed a bit of my dungeon

10407.0 --> 10412.58
dragons map campaign Maps

10409.64 --> 10416.42
it was good looking through that again

10412.58 --> 10419.479
and then we went on about the upcoming

10416.42 --> 10422.960000000001
covert measures and communists

10419.479 --> 10427.72
and how to deal with communists

10422.96 --> 10427.72
and how serious it is

10428.24 --> 10432.02
what happens when you comply with code

10430.34 --> 10433.939
measures like that there's actual

10432.02 --> 10435.439
consequences for everybody when you do

10433.939 --> 10438.439
that

10435.439 --> 10442.54
so be aware of that and exert peer

10438.439 --> 10442.54
pressure against people that are being

10442.64 --> 10447.099999999999
that are wanting to go along with it

10447.279 --> 10453.979000000001
exert pressure don't just let them do it

10452.12 --> 10455.899000000001
they're gonna cause trouble for other

10453.979 --> 10458.3
people by doing that and they need to be

10455.899 --> 10459.979
made aware of that they need to feel the

10458.3 --> 10461.479
pressure they need to feel the heat for

10459.979 --> 10464.66
that

10461.479 --> 10467.38
complying is no longer just tolerant

10464.66 --> 10467.38
tolerable

10470.72 --> 10475.119999999999
that's right never comply share those

10472.7 --> 10475.12
that do

10478.58 --> 10485.02

10480.92 --> 10485.02
