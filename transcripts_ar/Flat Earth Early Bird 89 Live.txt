260.18 --> 267.61

of like to have some

291.139 --> 295.249
only Schiphol can't see

313.969 --> 321.86
anyway yeah I was before this I I got up

318.049 --> 324.85999999999996
really early today because I don't know

321.86 --> 328.42900000000003
I was drinking some red wine yesterday

324.86 --> 332.469
night probably way too late that I even

328.429 --> 335.86899999999997
started that just wanted to and

332.469 --> 341.80899999999997
yeah weird side effect is often that I

335.869 --> 344.619
wake up like unusually early I was

341.809 --> 344.619
listening to

344.96 --> 348.46
over the Benjamins show

349.42 --> 357.16
and he had this hilarious clip I posted

353.05 --> 365.41
it in the early bird chat buzz is a liar

357.16 --> 368.20000000000005
and was just amazing just the the occult

365.41 --> 372.16
of comedy the irony in the situation is

368.2 --> 382.42
just it is fascinating to see hey was

372.16 --> 386.52000000000004
that legendary looming hyena 2.0 donated

382.42 --> 391.42
11 pounds thank you very much riley rekt

386.52 --> 395.26
was he I I hadn't noticed

391.42 --> 397.27000000000004
really I yeah he was live yesterday I

395.26 --> 400.65999999999997
didn't follow it there was too many

397.27 --> 404.74
other things just too much too many

400.66 --> 408.06
things to watch they're all trying to

404.74 --> 413.04
grab my attention from all sides

408.06 --> 413.04
anyway hello Karen be good to see you

420.71 --> 422.95
right

423.82 --> 430.419
so it was a super Chet

426.71 --> 430.419
bribe was it

430.77 --> 436.099
fine

433.11 --> 441.199
you're gonna be talking with your socks

436.099 --> 441.199
then I might as just as well and lock it

457.83 --> 462.19899999999996
all right around lux

462.21 --> 466.289
but yeah I did block you for a good

464.55 --> 468.03000000000003
reason though I don't remember what that

466.289 --> 469.77
was but it was for a good reason

468.03 --> 473.60999999999996
probably because you said something

469.77 --> 477.57
really and nasty you do that sometimes

473.61 --> 481.97900000000004
and it's a very bad habit also it's not

477.57 --> 484.74
funny when you do that you know I

481.979 --> 488.4
appreciate some funny trolling here and

484.74 --> 494.61
there but when it's just not funny then

488.4 --> 497.33
I don't like it other time you out or

494.61 --> 497.33000000000004
I'll block you

500.86 --> 505.02000000000004
but sure I'll be friends

513.53 --> 516.25
anyway

516.269 --> 521.4590000000001
I'm gonna I'm gonna steal joke for a

518.729 --> 524.7900000000001
second maybe it's because it's been mean

521.459 --> 526.9799999999999
so much but I think everything will be

524.79 --> 532.0999999999999
probably all right I'll get where I want

526.98 --> 532.1
to because hey I got a mustache

552.959 --> 558.079
I kind of giggle every time it says that

568.65 --> 577.51
mmm-hmm your hyena and Hina's struggle

572.8 --> 579.43
with political correctness do they well

577.51 --> 584.95
it's not always about political

579.43 --> 588.4899999999999
correctness you know if you're speaking

584.95 --> 593.74
you don't always have to be super

588.49 --> 599.53
sensitive it's just that it's good not

593.74 --> 602.08
to be a dick to people especially

599.53 --> 603.5699999999999
because it's not really good for you

602.08 --> 607.33
either

603.57 --> 612.2800000000001
you know maybe an impulse but what is it

607.33 --> 615.97
gonna do for you even just prove you're

612.28 --> 621.31
a dick it has nothing to do with

615.97 --> 623.2900000000001
political correctness you know you can

621.31 --> 625.3299999999999
say something really straightforward and

623.29 --> 628.78
if the intention is right then the

625.33 --> 631.48
intention is right if you're being a

628.78 --> 634.15
dick then you're just being a blatant

631.48 --> 636.07
dick and yeah you can even be a dick in

634.15 --> 637.99
a politically correct fashion and

636.07 --> 640.24
there's the weird part that's actually

637.99 --> 643.8100000000001
kind of funny although you're still

640.24 --> 645.76
being a dick now if you're trying to be

643.81 --> 646.27
nice and you're being politically

645.76 --> 650.14
correct

646.27 --> 652.22
then you're being like oversensitive and

650.14 --> 657.38
that

652.22 --> 658.95
makes it a bit silly in a way it's

657.38 --> 663.62
complicated than just political

658.95 --> 663.62
correctness there oh dear I did it again

666.35 --> 673.34
there's no matter how much I try I

669.0 --> 673.34
always talk about things

694.17 --> 700.959
right a gem don't talk about yourself

697.839 --> 706.99
and people that hate you talk about

700.959 --> 713.1099999999999
around you around me around me here is

706.99 --> 717.76
Mike there's a one-third filled cup of

713.11 --> 722.98
tea there's a mouse there's a desk

717.76 --> 725.35
there's an old off broken teapot there's

722.98 --> 728.24
a chair

725.35 --> 731.48
the edge of a carpet

728.24 --> 738.1
and lots of junk here over a side table

731.48 --> 738.1
and yeah anything else

744.64 --> 747.24
not

748.9 --> 754.6
all right I don't always talk about

751.74 --> 757.5
people that rate very because I don't

754.6 --> 761.58
really care about them you know

757.5 --> 765.52
sometimes to do get lured in and then I

761.58 --> 767.86
referenced that I think it's wrong blah

765.52 --> 770.5
blah blah I don't do that all the time

767.86 --> 771.97
I'm not obsessed with my opponents if

770.5 --> 774.85
you get obsessed over them there only

771.97 --> 777.97
gets stronger and they'll spawn more

774.85 --> 781.21
other people have this weird twisted

777.97 --> 785.32
inspiration like oh yeah I could be in

781.21 --> 787.08
attention as well so I I prefer to talk

785.32 --> 790.3900000000001
about good people nice people

787.08 --> 794.22
interesting people people that have the

790.39 --> 794.22
potential to change for the better

797.079 --> 807.949
and that can be people that are kind of

800.24 --> 810.949
dicks as well so it doesn't make me talk

807.949 --> 813.529
about people that hate me see now I

810.949 --> 815.209
wasted like five minutes talking very

813.529 --> 817.91
seriously about something that wasn't

815.209 --> 821.05
even meant that serious problem probably

817.91 --> 821.05
so stupid

830.19 --> 832.759
it's

835.63 --> 846.16
I'll try to explain like something about

839.68 --> 848.38
what it is like to have this [ __ ] follow

846.16 --> 855.819
you around in your life and not get all

848.38 --> 859.389
emotional about it but it's just it's

855.819 --> 861.87
just this weird sensation of being

859.389 --> 866.44
completely useless

861.87 --> 868.6
having no influence whatever you do and

866.44 --> 871.589
if you do it's not lasting it's not

868.6 --> 871.589
gonna actually

873.36 --> 880.96
end up the way you wanted it that's how

879.13 --> 883.57
it feels and sometimes that's how it

880.96 --> 885.52
looks and every time something good

883.57 --> 887.4100000000001
happens like something really really

885.52 --> 892.84
good happens now here's the weirdest

887.41 --> 895.78
part makes me feel like [ __ ] makes me

892.84 --> 905.2900000000001
feel like either I didn't deserve it

895.78 --> 907.9
or it's too much yeah and I even had

905.29 --> 911.4399999999999
this when I was a little kid it's like

907.9 --> 914.92
when I got overwhelmingly happy about

911.44 --> 920.0200000000001
something that would pretty quickly

914.92 --> 923.41
switch into like a weird out of place

920.02 --> 925.48
kind of depression response even not

923.41 --> 928.3299999999999
like afterward you know everybody has

925.48 --> 930.28
like a post hide depression moment when

928.33 --> 933.85
they have something really great but

930.28 --> 938.02
with me it would like arrive while I was

933.85 --> 941.1
actually supposed to enjoy it that

938.02 --> 941.1
really sucks

947.96 --> 957.5600000000001
yeah just thank God it's not always like

951.77 --> 961.0889999999999
that sometimes everything is just normal

957.56 --> 963.8299999999999
and everything just works normal and

961.089 --> 965.7090000000001
don't worry about anything because hey

963.83 --> 972.85
everything will be all right you know

965.709 --> 972.8499999999999
technically or subjectively

977.519 --> 981.86
I just know that I got all these dreams

979.559 --> 981.86
and

984.68 --> 994.579
and I sometimes just wonder like this is

990.199 --> 999.55
the weirdest sensation like maybe if I

994.579 --> 1003.7589999999999
make sure I don't don't actually

999.55 --> 1006.569
accomplish those dreams then at least

1003.759 --> 1009.569
I'll have something nice to look at

1006.569 --> 1009.569
forever

1009.8 --> 1015.16
that's probably just completely wrong

1015.519 --> 1025.029
because in a way you get dreams to

1018.649 --> 1025.029
manifest them and then get over them but

1027.58 --> 1033.3999999999999
feels like I got stuck in between the

1030.29 --> 1033.3999999999999
process somewhere

1036.55 --> 1049.78
it's weird anyway hmm right what type of

1043.809 --> 1053.95
Dreams it's that's the thing like I

1049.78 --> 1060.46
started out grand dreams like really

1053.95 --> 1063.179
world overarching stuff as like my place

1060.46 --> 1063.179
what I want

1066.43 --> 1074.0800000000002
I it's like I wanted to be a glorious

1070.33 --> 1076.78
leader kind of thing it's like a young

1074.08 --> 1080.23
boy's dream I guess and just save the

1076.78 --> 1086.77
world be the great father kind of thing

1080.23 --> 1088.54
it's so typical but as I grew little

1086.77 --> 1092.53
older got confronted with what the

1088.54 --> 1095.35
world's really like it's like more and

1092.53 --> 1098.82
more I just realized that some of those

1095.35 --> 1103.23
dreams just never really work out

1098.82 --> 1106.53
without an equal and opposite backlash

1103.23 --> 1106.53
it's like

1111.98 --> 1126.73
so the the older I grew the more I just

1119.0 --> 1129.62
wanted basic things right very funny

1126.73 --> 1130.13
well let me tell you I don't want it

1129.62 --> 1134.4189999999999
anymore

1130.13 --> 1139.49
like damn well don't just look at this

1134.419 --> 1143.3600000000001
world world doesn't want to be led it

1139.49 --> 1145.61
doesn't it just the world just wants

1143.36 --> 1147.9189999999999
what they want they don't want to be led

1145.61 --> 1150.11
they just want to get what they want

1147.919 --> 1152.0590000000002
that's really all they want let's see

1150.11 --> 1154.37
that's what everybody was they just want

1152.059 --> 1157.34
to get what they want they don't want to

1154.37 --> 1160.36
be led they just want someone else to

1157.34 --> 1160.36
make it all happen

1188.95 --> 1191.67
anyway

1193.4 --> 1199.8700000000001
what I want now is just some kind of

1196.55 --> 1199.87
weird conception of

1200.37 --> 1211.5
life I don't know wife kids but at the

1208.35 --> 1215.01
same time I feel like and this is a

1211.5 --> 1219.63
weird weird ass sensation and I can't

1215.01 --> 1226.8799999999999
really place it but I feel like it's

1219.63 --> 1226.88
forbidden like no you can't do that

1228.23 --> 1235.6100000000001
because you know why not

1238.17 --> 1245.24
I've been hearing so many times yeah

1240.27 --> 1248.22
like one day you'll just run into it and

1245.24 --> 1254.13
know everything will fall into place and

1248.22 --> 1256.08
yeah you know I'm literally 39 today

1254.13 --> 1262.98
yeah it's my birthday

1256.08 --> 1265.74
39 today and well can't say that it

1262.98 --> 1272.97
happened you know it's not like I'm

1265.74 --> 1278.19
literally stuck in nowhere I do do stuff

1272.97 --> 1282.95
go to places talk to people even get to

1278.19 --> 1285.8700000000001
see really interesting looking women and

1282.95 --> 1288.02
some are really beautiful or interesting

1285.87 --> 1292.59
or dangerous or some kind of it's just

1288.02 --> 1294.48
it's not happening and it's almost like

1292.59 --> 1296.9399999999998
I'm happy about it that's the weirdest

1294.48 --> 1299.13
parts like no it'll be a ride you're

1296.94 --> 1301.28
just gonna be alone and you're gonna die

1299.13 --> 1304.65
alone you're not gonna have any kids and

1301.28 --> 1312.27
you're going to be happy about it Yeah

1304.65 --> 1315.14
right you know it doesn't make any damn

1312.27 --> 1315.1399999999999
sense to me

1319.65 --> 1327.0
on the other hands in that way I guess

1324.02 --> 1332.01
with the longing of never being able to

1327.0 --> 1336.3
get that I can kind of as a

1332.01 --> 1339.96
consolidation price project that longing

1336.3 --> 1344.69
and that love on others around me that I

1339.96 --> 1350.3700000000001
care about and help them to get that

1344.69 --> 1351.3300000000002
what I want and I try to do that as much

1350.37 --> 1353.9599999999998
as possible

1351.33 --> 1357.4399999999998
it's like compulsive I want to do that

1353.96 --> 1357.44
desperate to do that

1358.99 --> 1361.6200000000001
but

1365.15 --> 1369.13
just seems out of whack

1377.46 --> 1383.63
anyway yeah thank you guys happy

1381.39 --> 1389.3100000000002
birthday

1383.63 --> 1393.65
don't mind me not to be being all

1389.31 --> 1398.85
ecstatic about it at this moment well

1393.65 --> 1401.21
yeah you know it doesn't it's very funny

1398.85 --> 1401.2099999999998
being

1404.09 --> 1411.86
yeah exactly [ __ ] Jews you know the

1407.3 --> 1415.43
right woman is out there and I thought

1411.86 --> 1420.4399999999998
that I met that woman okay and I lived

1415.43 --> 1423.19
with her for three years and she didn't

1420.44 --> 1423.19
want any kids

1428.4 --> 1436.0
she

1430.57 --> 1437.55
at like a compulsive baseline obsession

1436.0 --> 1442.77
with money

1437.55 --> 1447.19
something I'm terrible at general I am a

1442.77 --> 1450.01
money black hole it seems and I feel

1447.19 --> 1454.3
guilty about it although not guilty and

1450.01 --> 1456.61
scared like yeah or win why don't you

1454.3 --> 1460.54
get a job why don't you this went that

1456.61 --> 1467.11
well because I feel like a freaking

1460.54 --> 1469.8999999999999
[ __ ] and I'm Way too smart for

1467.11 --> 1473.1699999999998
somebody that's crippled that makes it

1469.9 --> 1479.5900000000001
even worse you know because some average

1473.17 --> 1482.47
[ __ ] just ya know nobody that actually

1479.59 --> 1484.27
endears people and they want to give

1482.47 --> 1484.96
them jobs and that feel good in their

1484.27 --> 1487.84
presence

1484.96 --> 1490.03
because yeah they are smarter and the

1487.84 --> 1492.07
person will probably be enjoying

1490.03 --> 1495.46
themselves and they may actually help

1492.07 --> 1498.6399999999999
them the with advice well I'm a smart

1495.46 --> 1502.0900000000001
guy so this has the exact opposite

1498.64 --> 1509.22
response it's I'm just [ __ ] I'm just

1502.09 --> 1514.79
freakin [ __ ] and yeah self-pity

1509.22 --> 1518.75
self-loathing what are you doing

1514.79 --> 1520.299
it's not like that right that doesn't

1518.75 --> 1525.04
make any sense right

1520.299 --> 1525.04
well that's how it's all reflecting

1526.69 --> 1529.749
and I damn well want to get over it

1528.879 --> 1533.799
trust me I do

1529.749 --> 1535.95
and yeah I have hope every time every

1533.799 --> 1538.869
time something happens some new

1535.95 --> 1541.3890000000001
opportunity seems to be gazing at me in

1538.869 --> 1545.379
the distance from within that perishing

1541.389 --> 1549.4889999999998
zone start to pop up in a reflection of

1545.379 --> 1552.299
itself but yeah when I actually get

1549.489 --> 1557.409
there it looks completely different

1552.299 --> 1562.47
so no not having any meltdowns I'm not

1557.409 --> 1565.45
gonna have any more meltdowns you know

1562.47 --> 1568.059
if anything I'll have a meltdown because

1565.45 --> 1572.289
suddenly my life just unfolded and I

1568.059 --> 1574.899
suddenly got that yeah there's gonna be

1572.289 --> 1577.779
meltdown at some point it'll probably be

1574.899 --> 1581.279
some kind of manic meltdown and not a

1577.779 --> 1581.279
depressed no times

1594.39 --> 1596.99
right

1598.89 --> 1606.21
alright Dark Star well no I'm not look

1602.58 --> 1608.3999999999999
as soon as you say read this well guess

1606.21 --> 1608.58
what's gonna happen I'm not gonna read

1608.4 --> 1611.5800000000002
it

1608.58 --> 1619.29
I don't read things especially books I

1611.58 --> 1621.4499999999998
don't and the funny thing is the older

1619.29 --> 1624.27
I've gotten the more I've learned to

1621.45 --> 1627.6000000000001
appreciate not reading books and it's

1624.27 --> 1631.2
funny because other people say yeah Wow

1627.6 --> 1632.8799999999999
as I got older you know the books so

1631.2 --> 1636.299
glad that I read all the books well I

1632.88 --> 1638.179
have the exact opposite just so glad

1636.299 --> 1641.61
that I didn't read all those books

1638.179 --> 1644.9
because back then I had no idea what I

1641.61 --> 1648.1499999999999
was really reading and I would have just

1644.9 --> 1650.94
sank deeper into the swamp of illusions

1648.15 --> 1653.7900000000002
you know now if I'd read a book I

1650.94 --> 1656.3700000000001
wouldn't would barely be able to enjoy

1653.79 --> 1658.2
it because I'd see all the crazy stuff

1656.37 --> 1662.059
the delusions the dwellings of the

1658.2 --> 1667.53
people that wrote it the occult backdrop

1662.059 --> 1670.83
secretly weaved into it by the dark

1667.53 --> 1673.25
forces all that [ __ ] so it's all useless

1670.83 --> 1673.25
to me

1679.179 --> 1690.279
and it's not really it's just that when

1686.469 --> 1694.059
you try to read books for knowledge that

1690.279 --> 1698.229
seems to be a misconception to me

1694.059 --> 1701.129
because yeah I got knowledge right you

1698.229 --> 1704.469
noticed that I understand things right

1701.129 --> 1710.6789999999999
well that's not coming from books it's

1704.469 --> 1715.8690000000001
not I just I just see it I don't need I

1710.679 --> 1724.409
don't need to have read a book just got

1715.869 --> 1724.4089999999999
it yeah I'm 39 now

1737.97 --> 1747.809
ah I'm glad you guys seem to be kind of

1743.159 --> 1752.6000000000001
enjoying yourself out there reading

1747.809 --> 1752.6
books is renews you right

1756.26 --> 1764.809
I really do wonder how that is how that

1761.179 --> 1768.3500000000001
works like this again the duality of

1764.809 --> 1771.02
things people in school as kids just

1768.35 --> 1774.02
goofing off not paying attention having

1771.02 --> 1777.07
fun probably doing some drugs and

1774.02 --> 1779.99
fooling around with the other sex and

1777.07 --> 1784.76
yeah not paying attention getting shitty

1779.99 --> 1789.22
grades then probably being forced to get

1784.76 --> 1789.22
a pretty shitty job at first and then

1789.52 --> 1797.87
yeah growing under the pressure but

1795.47 --> 1802.34
people that we do read it oh yeah they

1797.87 --> 1806.02
become the fabric they become programmed

1802.34 --> 1806.02
with that fabric

1810.22 --> 1816.039
how much are they missing how much will

1812.649 --> 1818.5
they never really get because they

1816.039 --> 1820.99
focused on that so much and you know a

1818.5 --> 1822.789
lot of nerds I guess that maybe it's an

1820.99 --> 1828.22
overgeneralization but yeah

1822.789 --> 1833.879
nerds escape into books and knowledge

1828.22 --> 1833.8790000000001
because socially it's not working out

1838.34 --> 1848.1799999999998
so yeah are you gonna miss the knowledge

1841.63 --> 1850.88
or the lore but you can yeah

1848.18 --> 1853.3400000000001
put on you like a throne and like a

1850.88 --> 1857.1200000000001
crown and and be all smart over other

1853.34 --> 1863.33
people be the wiser one or as seen as

1857.12 --> 1865.9699999999998
the wiser one or are you gonna be the

1863.33 --> 1869.9499999999998
guy that really knows life and that gets

1865.97 --> 1876.89
real personal individual problems that

1869.95 --> 1879.26
almost everybody deals with or yeah and

1876.89 --> 1884.69
at the same time a you can just turn

1879.26 --> 1889.1299999999999
flip over turn into a total [ __ ] as

1884.69 --> 1893.45
well but that's both sides no nerds can

1889.13 --> 1897.23
become total evil maniacs as well

1893.45 --> 1905.0
it's just thought this duality it's all

1897.23 --> 1909.43
the same and the weird thing with me is

1905.0 --> 1912.59
I seem to have done really neither I

1909.43 --> 1915.17
didn't really read all the books I did

1912.59 --> 1917.2099999999998
some though and when I did my god is

1915.17 --> 1920.42
just like all this magic just came

1917.21 --> 1924.04
flying in my face all these insights in

1920.42 --> 1928.13
the hopes and yeah soon something

1924.04 --> 1931.1599999999999
something space or I would just

1928.13 --> 1934.5500000000002
immediately latch onto that and extend

1931.16 --> 1939.2900000000002
it expand it and basically start to work

1934.55 --> 1941.81
on um on NASA as fantasy expansion

1939.29 --> 1945.74
without even realizing it just building

1941.81 --> 1948.44
that virtual puzzle because I could and

1945.74 --> 1952.97
I did that but I didn't always do that

1948.44 --> 1954.92
and I also tried to have a bit of a

1952.97 --> 1959.66
social life and fooling around and did

1954.92 --> 1962.42
get some of it but was never really that

1959.66 --> 1965.6000000000001
glorious although yeah in retrospect is

1962.42 --> 1967.67
it ever really that glorious or does it

1965.6 --> 1972.6799999999998
just become some kind of pecking order

1967.67 --> 1975.6200000000001
social game where yeah if you get a lot

1972.68 --> 1977.6000000000001
of chicks it's very rare that you're

1975.62 --> 1979.6699999999998
actually gonna appreciate it and it's

1977.6 --> 1985.48
gonna become more about status than

1979.67 --> 1985.48
actual personal connection all that so

1992.08 --> 1994.59
yeah

1996.91 --> 2000.0500000000002
are you guys talking about

2000.33 --> 2010.99
Sherman ah tea seriously piss off I'm

2007.45 --> 2016.0
gonna ban you again if you don't stop

2010.99 --> 2019.53

2025.15 --> 2030.01

2100.4 --> 2105.17
day I watched it back to see how badly

2103.31 --> 2110.0299999999997
my voice was because I told you when I

2105.17 --> 2115.82
called my voice is recovering and and I

2110.03 --> 2121.03
saw it coming about speak Japanese you

2115.82 --> 2125.3900000000003
speak German us you learned it her

2121.03 --> 2126.1090000000004
I'm gradually forgetting it ah how did

2125.39 --> 2131.27
you learn it

2126.109 --> 2132.89
I studied three years of high school and

2131.27 --> 2134.93
then I got a scholarship your scam

2132.89 --> 2137.75
it's called a scholarship exchange when

2134.93 --> 2144.14
I had my sweet 16 over in Japan cool I

2137.75 --> 2148.789
went to a Japanese high school nice

2144.14 --> 2149.8689999999997
so you know I I noticed a lot of people

2148.789 --> 2152.779
in your chat you know they have a lot of

2149.869 --> 2154.67
support for you but the other day I

2152.779 --> 2159.259
spoke for a long time without showing my

2154.67 --> 2163.069
face and Here I am appreciate it

2159.259 --> 2166.369
you didn't necessarily need to but yeah

2163.069 --> 2169.009
well I just I just want to kind of give

2166.369 --> 2170.869
this message out the other people there

2169.009 --> 2174.859
was a few comments about me being nasty

2170.869 --> 2176.42
to a few of the flat-earthers right it

2174.859 --> 2181.0389999999998
was because they were nasty to the

2176.42 --> 2183.23
ballers and it kind of just kind of you

2181.039 --> 2186.349
know step up you know no matter what you

2183.23 --> 2188.72
believe in step up in and say it you

2186.349 --> 2191.71
know sorry hopefully by showing my face

2188.72 --> 2197.359
and being just random on your show again

2191.71 --> 2200.2690000000002
it's going to encourage people you know

2197.359 --> 2205.19
and let people know that they can do it

2200.269 --> 2209.9599999999996
too right great and yeah nasty behavior

2205.19 --> 2212.599
is never good no nasty behavior is it's

2209.96 --> 2214.91
a sign of weakness somebody laughing as

2212.599 --> 2217.309
somebody who's showing their face while

2214.91 --> 2218.749
they comment behind the keyboard safety

2217.309 --> 2219.529
and they disappear come back with a

2218.749 --> 2222.769
stock account

2219.529 --> 2224.45
it just shows been to put them in a

2222.769 --> 2225.3999999999996
vulnerable position they could never

2224.45 --> 2228.9199999999996
handle it

2225.4 --> 2232.279
you know and and a lot of a lot of

2228.92 --> 2236.21
people like to go to comedy shows but

2232.279 --> 2238.779
you know but when there's a silent or

2236.21 --> 2242.989
yeah I did feel in the air you know that

2238.779 --> 2245.15
they would be I guess you know unable to

2242.989 --> 2247.67
handle that so they'd rather laugh or

2245.15 --> 2249.38
laugh along and so I think it's

2247.67 --> 2254.299
important you know in a world where

2249.38 --> 2257.15
there's so much focus on looking perfect

2254.299 --> 2258.88
in all these these these Heights that

2257.15 --> 2261.33
you can't reach

2258.88 --> 2264.61
but you see something before efficiency

2261.33 --> 2270.5699999999997
yeah this is something used to before

2264.61 --> 2274.81
and the idea that came to mind about not

2270.57 --> 2278.6800000000003
yet oh yeah that's just I feel stuff I

2274.81 --> 2282.52
feel I feel good things for you up you

2278.68 --> 2285.7599999999998
know and you know I I've heard heard of

2282.52 --> 2288.0
sang with 12 once you know and it was as

2285.76 --> 2296.9500000000003
the great friction comes great reward

2288.0 --> 2299.04
and I really believe that whoa thank you

2296.95 --> 2303.16
man that's quite a birthday present

2299.04 --> 2305.17
thank you for that wow that man might

2303.16 --> 2307.66
yeah I already my super chat was already

2305.17 --> 2308.62
like at ninety or something it's been

2307.66 --> 2310.6299999999997
going pretty hard

2308.62 --> 2316.24
also the monetization has been ramping

2310.63 --> 2319.71
up at this being you just added fifty

2316.24 --> 2323.95
percent to everything thanks man

2319.71 --> 2327.4900000000002
sorry continue no you definitely have to

2323.95 --> 2329.71
say thank you for that yeah so although

2327.49 --> 2334.3599999999997
I still haven't figured out how to

2329.71 --> 2336.93
actually use that money yet and I tried

2334.36 --> 2339.6400000000003
to look like for an hour digging through

2336.93 --> 2341.47
looking up video since like oh yeah this

2339.64 --> 2344.97
is how you activated this is how you get

2341.47 --> 2348.43
it this is how you give it but nowhere

2344.97 --> 2351.3399999999997
nowhere can I found anything about how

2348.43 --> 2356.08
to actually turn it into money or to buy

2351.34 --> 2360.2200000000003
something with it I can't find it like

2356.08 --> 2363.88
is that a myth or something I really

2360.22 --> 2367.33
know how to use the hangar yeah but it's

2363.88 --> 2368.9500000000003
so weird they're like it's probably not

2367.33 --> 2371.74
gonna be true because otherwise somebody

2368.95 --> 2375.16
would have told me but it's almost feels

2371.74 --> 2377.9199999999996
like yeah might it actually be a scam

2375.16 --> 2379.99
and no but you can only just give it to

2377.92 --> 2382.44
other people on Google because it's just

2379.99 --> 2385.5789999999997
virtual money and you can never cash it

2382.44 --> 2389.42
like like computer game

2385.579 --> 2392.03
resources in computer games you know it

2389.42 --> 2395.0
almost like can you really catch it but

2392.03 --> 2398.329
yeah you should be able to like maybe

2395.0 --> 2402.099
that says them else but I can't find any

2398.329 --> 2405.71
link in how to do it it's so weird

2402.099 --> 2409.329
so somebody advised me on that I already

2405.71 --> 2410.81
asked Nathan like yeah how do you do it

2409.329 --> 2413.63
response yet

2410.81 --> 2415.19
look at that comb and I get cuts to for

2413.63 --> 2422.569
a dollar do you know how long it takes

2415.19 --> 2432.9500000000003
the growth low here man right but I mean

2422.569 --> 2436.099
I made sure it was so long but anyway

2432.95 --> 2440.6299999999997
yeah I'd love to try see if that can

2436.099 --> 2444.8590000000004
work and maybe I'm just gonna save up

2440.63 --> 2450.8900000000003
and until I can just buy a p900 with it

2444.859 --> 2453.8289999999997
outright what I understand is that they

2450.89 --> 2457.94
that you know YouTube takes a portion of

2453.829 --> 2460.54
it and then you get the wrist so yeah

2457.94 --> 2464.69
but where how do you actually do that

2460.54 --> 2468.56
because I got this super jet funds

2464.69 --> 2471.109
reserve now that I can look up but

2468.56 --> 2473.34
there's just no clue in how to actually

2471.109 --> 2476.22
get it

2473.34 --> 2481.4900000000002
and I have supposed he already met that

2476.22 --> 2481.49
limit I'm way over the $70 but

2484.02 --> 2490.029
anyway I'll find out soon enough

2487.25 --> 2492.339
probably

2490.029 --> 2496.239
but I did find it very weird that it's

2492.339 --> 2499.179
so hard to find out yeah through YouTube

2496.239 --> 2501.899
for google search like in the YouTube

2499.179 --> 2504.639
menus themselves I worked for that

2501.899 --> 2509.799
trying to find that for an hour just

2504.639 --> 2511.449
couldn't finish find it at all but it's

2509.799 --> 2514.629
definitely real money gone from the

2511.449 --> 2520.119
account my accounts that it's not

2514.629 --> 2524.5789999999997
virtual for missing right yeah obviously

2520.119 --> 2529.329
people do actually have to transfer bank

2524.579 --> 2532.8990000000003
based money into the super chat system

2529.329 --> 2536.4590000000003
to do it although I think you can also

2532.899 --> 2539.649
actually use super chat reserves to

2536.459 --> 2541.479
throw it at other people again not sure

2539.649 --> 2543.989
if that is even possible directly I

2541.479 --> 2543.989
haven't tried

2545.97 --> 2556.89
right veloute yeah if you don't want oh

2548.88 --> 2559.8
thanks thanks again the empty matrix if

2556.89 --> 2563.0989999999997
you better cash all these pennies on am

2559.8 --> 2565.19
I gonna flip out I'm gonna try I'm gonna

2563.099 --> 2565.19
try

2569.59 --> 2575.1400000000003
no I'm pretty sure it was a scam you

2573.19 --> 2578.8
know somebody would have found out about

2575.14 --> 2580.2999999999997
it five hundred plus live shows it go

2578.8 --> 2585.48
they're like oh we met a thousand a

2580.3 --> 2588.82
little bit nobody or it's actually a

2585.48 --> 2590.83
bribe scam kind of like what vaccines

2588.82 --> 2593.77
are it's like the people that really

2590.83 --> 2596.02
have a lot of income of it they get

2593.77 --> 2598.78
bribed by Google saying like yeah you

2596.02 --> 2601.96
can't actually cash it but we'll give

2598.78 --> 2604.1400000000003
you this money if you don't talk about

2601.96 --> 2604.14
it

2605.22 --> 2610.3799999999997
paid the material think about it it's

2608.29 --> 2614.77
weird

2610.38 --> 2617.29
probably not but maybe maybe I just

2614.77 --> 2619.5099999999998
maybe I just lifted that one little

2617.29 --> 2623.35
pitch I shouldn't have right now I don't

2619.51 --> 2625.69
know maybe it is that will be really

2623.35 --> 2631.5099999999998
crazy and there would be a lot of people

2625.69 --> 2634.54
in on it taking Google Drive money to

2631.51 --> 2642.9900000000002
tune hide to not reveal that's you can't

2634.54 --> 2645.4
actually cash a super check probably not

2642.99 --> 2647.83
for what I understand is thirty percent

2645.4 --> 2650.4100000000003
is already kind of steep yeah exactly

2647.83 --> 2655.12
that's like double tax for like a good

2650.41 --> 2657.49
job but yeah what is it

2655.12 --> 2659.71
that's gonna say there was a fundraiser

2657.49 --> 2660.97
the other day and the person seemed to

2659.71 --> 2663.67
get the money and then they shared

2660.97 --> 2666.6699999999996
themself you know in your place or what

2663.67 --> 2670.48
it was so pretty elaborate to go to

2666.67 --> 2673.53
those links if it's all in on that so to

2670.48 --> 2673.53
speak but you know

2673.7 --> 2681.68
yeah it's probably not true it's too

2676.46 --> 2684.579
crazy and look in general bribing tends

2681.68 --> 2689.839
to be a lot more expensive than just

2684.579 --> 2693.6800000000003
legally paying out look it could only

2689.839 --> 2697.91
work on a couple of top people that have

2693.68 --> 2699.8289999999997
huge amounts because yeah what they make

2697.91 --> 2704.45
most what Google probably makes the most

2699.829 --> 2707.4500000000003
on is just people doing like 2 euros or

2704.45 --> 2710.569
2 dollars because almost anyone can do

2707.45 --> 2714.589
that and they will want to do it just to

2710.569 --> 2719.089
be nice or the part group kudos or

2714.589 --> 2722.18
anything you know so I think they get a

2719.089 --> 2724.099
huge amount of money flow from just the

2722.18 --> 2727.43
general public throwing a couple of

2724.099 --> 2729.77
dollars at other people you know and not

2727.43 --> 2736.04
so much from from really rich people

2729.77 --> 2738.41
that are just like showing yeah showing

2736.04 --> 2742.13
the cheddar and just rolling out huge

2738.41 --> 2745.93
chunks of super to chat cash because

2742.13 --> 2745.9300000000003
that's probably not going to be as much

2752.85 --> 2761.3399999999997
I think I think you work it out anyway

2758.07 --> 2765.0
it was just a really yeah a conspiracy

2761.34 --> 2779.01
theories possibility it's ridiculous

2765.0 --> 2780.78
yeah bored or something yeah you you

2779.01 --> 2784.53
were on with me pretty long the other

2780.78 --> 2786.9
day right yeah went on for two hours

2784.53 --> 2788.73
total there was no way for me to kind of

2786.9 --> 2792.59
see cuz I had been how to use anything

2788.73 --> 2795.9
how long I've been talking forth there I

2792.59 --> 2798.6000000000004
think you kind of came in near the end

2795.9 --> 2801.9
and then it just kept on going for an

2798.6 --> 2810.48
hour and it was good was really intense

2801.9 --> 2812.31
but it was really long but no it's it

2810.48 --> 2816.33
gave me some clarity you know it gave me

2812.31 --> 2818.61
some things to think about you know tell

2816.33 --> 2821.99
me I'll tell you a little story and just

2818.61 --> 2825.1400000000003
a quick one when I got out of hospital

2821.99 --> 2828.4799999999996
after being in a living for living days

2825.14 --> 2830.99
it began to rain as I was walking down

2828.48 --> 2833.73
just you know around the street and

2830.99 --> 2835.5299999999997
everybody around me started running

2833.73 --> 2837.36
across the street and I swore to God

2835.53 --> 2839.55
that day that I'd never run in the rain

2837.36 --> 2841.6800000000003
because the feeling of rain on my face

2839.55 --> 2843.4500000000003
you know like again for the first time I

2841.68 --> 2847.56
could touch it was Nam in hospital with

2843.45 --> 2850.9199999999996
it was it was amazing and today I just I

2847.56 --> 2854.73
just felt compelled to go for a walk you

2850.92 --> 2856.9500000000003
know around 11:30 at night and I stopped

2854.73 --> 2859.47
at the church and I prayed in front of

2856.95 --> 2862.6499999999996
the cross there you know because I find

2859.47 --> 2866.7599999999998
any holy area you know enables me to

2862.65 --> 2868.4700000000003
reach God and then and many people have

2866.76 --> 2870.779
prayed inside so there's protection

2868.47 --> 2875.999
there and there's meaning

2870.779 --> 2879.15
and so I prayed just I'll travel

2875.999 --> 2881.249
tomorrow to see my father and now I just

2879.15 --> 2883.559
prayed I prayed for the strength that

2881.249 --> 2887.7889999999998
Jesus had to go through what he had to

2883.559 --> 2889.5890000000004
go through you know to fight the

2887.789 --> 2891.63
unknowable battle and the pain they had

2889.589 --> 2894.359
to go through just just to give me the

2891.63 --> 2896.789
strength to overcome all and not leave

2894.359 --> 2899.0989999999997
my tongue and be tired I have to see

2896.789 --> 2901.679
anybody like my brother anything like

2899.099 --> 2905.1890000000003
that and so I walked another thirty

2901.679 --> 2910.049
minutes up the road got to the gas

2905.189 --> 2914.279
station brought a drink and he handed me

2910.049 --> 2916.079
a he handed me a a scratch card to win a

2914.279 --> 2917.699
pair of headphones and I had a pair

2916.079 --> 2925.679
headphones because I was listening to

2917.699 --> 2927.589
the Quran and the rain began to rain on

2925.679 --> 2933.329
me and I was about an hour's walk home

2927.589 --> 2935.189
and I I didn't I didn't walk fast at all

2933.329 --> 2936.7490000000003
I just walked in the rain got heavier

2935.189 --> 2940.0789999999997
and heavier and heavier and by the time

2936.749 --> 2943.4089999999997
I got home I was absolutely so you know

2940.079 --> 2945.569
but in the last walk I remembered that I

2943.409 --> 2949.759
wouldn't wouldn't run in the rain again

2945.569 --> 2951.959
and I hit vines were protected because a

2949.759 --> 2955.5190000000002
church each chose to use the right

2951.959 --> 2958.609
clothing you know but it was just this

2955.519 --> 2962.069
this moment you know listening to like

2958.609 --> 2963.989
young unaltered Quran after battling

2962.069 --> 2965.759
with a whole heap of things today going

2963.989 --> 2969.719
away who tomorrow praying at the thing

2965.759 --> 2972.839
and it was like it was just it was just

2969.719 --> 2975.599
a cleansing you know I was a real it was

2972.839 --> 2977.759
a real wonderful feeling I didn't care I

2975.599 --> 2980.9390000000003
wasn't cold I wasn't shrimp shivering at

2977.759 --> 2984.719
all I was just I just enjoyed the walk

2980.939 --> 2985.81
High Line you know and it was fantastic

2984.719 --> 2989.5
and

2985.81 --> 2992.5299999999997
it's just it's just that we haven't had

2989.5 --> 2996.16
rain for so long you know oh no he's in

2992.53 --> 2999.61
yeah I was in the theory and the guys

2996.16 --> 3001.14
name he's chosen it's Michael and I said

2999.61 --> 3002.88
oh microwave so we used some rain and I

3001.14 --> 3005.2799999999997
said yeah hopefully we get some rain

3002.88 --> 3007.08
soon you know and I could have gone for

3005.28 --> 3010.1400000000003
a walk all today it was very very hot

3007.08 --> 3013.7999999999997
but one time I go for a walk if it

3010.14 --> 3016.2
rained on me and it was just it was just

3013.8 --> 3017.73
a really because no one else on the

3016.2 --> 3021.66
streets you know I'm usually this is

3017.73 --> 3023.73
such a like nobody it was chaos but it

3021.66 --> 3026.58
was not one person walking on the street

3023.73 --> 3031.37
and you know that we I feel really

3026.58 --> 3034.71
blessed that I can be out of nature and

3031.37 --> 3039.66
you know just be alone with my thoughts

3034.71 --> 3043.17
talk to God in my heart and you know and

3039.66 --> 3045.45
keep the connections yeah exactly and I

3043.17 --> 3048.69
just thought if it takes walking in the

3045.45 --> 3050.37
rain you absolutely soaked you know and

3048.69 --> 3053.61
the people who are driving past like

3050.37 --> 3055.56
slowing down and maybe like looking and

3053.61 --> 3057.63
laughing like you know Minnie do and I

3055.56 --> 3059.7
just I think it was it was just

3057.63 --> 3061.92
fantastic you know and I I think that's

3059.7 --> 3065.16
the that's a listen unless the rain is

3061.92 --> 3068.39
acid no just dinner just don't you know

3065.16 --> 3071.0099999999998
don't go don't go dancing in the rain

3068.39 --> 3075.24
when it starts raining right after a

3071.01 --> 3077.7900000000004
volcanic eruption trust me don't do it

3075.24 --> 3079.8799999999997
oh by the way I want to do a little

3077.79 --> 3084.15

superjet donation much appreciated

3101.31 --> 3103.7
thanks

3104.18 --> 3113.0589999999997
that's awesome

3105.89 --> 3118.529
yeah I agree I agree Alan you know I

3113.059 --> 3122.009
yeah again it's that it's that come on

3118.529 --> 3126.059
the show you know I mean speak you know

3122.009 --> 3128.009
show your face mm-hmm right especially

3126.059 --> 3131.059
especially these people that attack you

3128.009 --> 3133.979
you know it's like show your face please

3131.059 --> 3136.789
show us what we're dealing with show us

3133.979 --> 3142.22
how tough you know you are outside of

3136.789 --> 3146.9300000000003
the check that's never gonna work cuz

3142.22 --> 3151.2
like of course they're not doing it

3146.93 --> 3153.569
because if that would actually give them

3151.2 --> 3156.8999999999996
some kind of credit some power then they

3153.569 --> 3159.0589999999997
would have already but they know most of

3156.9 --> 3160.9790000000003
the people that hide forever and never

3159.059 --> 3164.7290000000003
show their face know that even though

3160.979 --> 3168.229
they want to be seen they know that

3164.729 --> 3171.6899999999996
they'll uncover the entire the entire

3168.229 --> 3173.9399999999996
mystery that they keep secret will be

3171.69 --> 3177.779
unraveled and it will be shown like yeah

3173.94 --> 3180.239
that person is sickly or has issues in

3177.779 --> 3182.849
this and that or oh that's the reason

3180.239 --> 3185.369
why he's doing this of course that kind

3182.849 --> 3188.94
of [ __ ] so yeah I totally get that

3185.369 --> 3194.369
they're not showing their face but if

3188.94 --> 3196.799
you're just a real person don't be like

3194.369 --> 3200.4500000000003
the trolls and just show who you are

3196.799 --> 3204.809
because it actually strengthens you

3200.45 --> 3208.1699999999996
as what you're doing it actually

3204.809 --> 3210.1800000000003
strengthens you to show you show the

3208.17 --> 3213.15
people out there that you're a real

3210.18 --> 3215.5989999999997
person with a real face and with real

3213.15 --> 3220.289
issues and that you haven't been

3215.599 --> 3227.1600000000003
screwing around and telling lies yeah

3220.289 --> 3231.21
and I I think if you if you saw a fight

3227.16 --> 3234.39
or the crash you do a question how okay

3231.21 --> 3239.119
how we yeah I'm still here talking to

3234.39 --> 3244.529
you right you had that story no you

3239.119 --> 3254.1800000000003
obviously had something important to be

3244.529 --> 3254.18
doing otherwise yeah yeah well I um

3256.24 --> 3262.8999999999996
I know that it will never leave my mind

3260.74 --> 3265.0589999999997
you know I know I know that like a

3262.9 --> 3266.44
covers I've come to the reserve and they

3265.059 --> 3272.1400000000003
reserve the fact that that's gonna be

3266.44 --> 3275.14
the way it is but it's also you know

3272.14 --> 3277.72
it's also helps me to remind myself that

3275.14 --> 3279.0989999999997
that's the moment that's the night you

3277.72 --> 3283.54
know that's the more the morning really

3279.099 --> 3286.29
that I embodied my faith it became it

3283.54 --> 3291.819
became more than just talking about it

3286.29 --> 3296.44
because because I called on it you know

3291.819 --> 3302.4
and you know I I put it up for judgment

3296.44 --> 3302.4
I see you know god am i worthy you know

3304.109 --> 3311.14
you know but do you also can you accept

3309.19 --> 3316.9500000000003
the answer because that seems to be a

3311.14 --> 3316.95
problem that I have well

3317.26 --> 3329.4
you know what if he said yes you know

3322.53 --> 3334.1400000000003
yeah well I've you know I I recorded I

3329.4 --> 3338.26
recorded myself when you know just

3334.14 --> 3342.49
basically verbatim as I remembered it

3338.26 --> 3346.96
and when I put when I was playing it

3342.49 --> 3351.0299999999997
back it was it was like the honesty in

3346.96 --> 3355.33
the in my voice because like I told you

3351.03 --> 3357.7000000000003
since that day it's like lying about God

3355.33 --> 3363.0699999999997
not doing what I feel inside when

3357.7 --> 3368.0499999999997
someone challenges faith in general it

3363.07 --> 3370.15
feels like hey you know I asked you you

3368.05 --> 3373.3
know and there's something will pop up

3370.15 --> 3376.71
in you know synchronicity or something

3373.3 --> 3380.4
and yeah it's like the angels lash out

3376.71 --> 3383.14
like no you can't [ __ ] around anymore

3380.4 --> 3386.56
because you're in the big league now

3383.14 --> 3389.609
you're in the spiritual real yeah you

3386.56 --> 3392.2599999999998
can't fool around like a dumb animal

3389.609 --> 3397.93
that kind of that's what I get sometimes

3392.26 --> 3401.7700000000004
but still why I do what I do

3397.93 --> 3405.609
whoa the money's raining down today

3468.259 --> 3471.799
wrote this myself

3473.45 --> 3480.319
really it's about God and I call it the

3477.479 --> 3480.319
message for faith

3481.53 --> 3484.53
okay

3502.94 --> 3508.099
this is really big huh just as to its

3506.089 --> 3511.64
it's just the tuesd so I couldn't hear

3508.099 --> 3515.3590000000004
you at all then went away it's just as

3511.64 --> 3517.43
it's about when I recorded it it was

3515.359 --> 3522.5589999999997
about one one minute 50

3517.43 --> 3525.049
oh it's a sound recording okay I know

3522.559 --> 3528.5890000000004
I'll read it well when I recorded a time

3525.049 --> 3531.47
and it was about one minute right it was

3528.589 --> 3534.0789999999997
about the time when I noticed all the

3531.47 --> 3535.519
hateful people you know rather than

3534.079 --> 3536.8390000000004
searching for their own saying I'm

3535.519 --> 3538.49
looking for God but show me your

3536.839 --> 3544.97
evidence it's like how are you really

3538.49 --> 3548.359
seeking you know right you're looking

3544.97 --> 3553.5989999999997
you know it makes it's an oxymoron from

3548.359 --> 3557.71
a [ __ ] anyway yeah here it goes

3553.599 --> 3562.25
disgraceful notes to the absolute most

3557.71 --> 3564.71
who guides you to never coast we'll have

3562.25 --> 3568.7
you standing tall again won't fall my

3564.71 --> 3572.109
friend God is your best lifeboat life's

3568.7 --> 3575.509
hope never have I seen such hate

3572.109 --> 3579.91
misplaced deranged mostly irate no

3575.509 --> 3583.819
evidence here we don't believe in faith

3579.91 --> 3586.64
well now maybe perhaps could this be

3583.819 --> 3589.779
exact the Creator is everything you as

3586.64 --> 3592.8489999999997
well the one reading this back I

3589.779 --> 3596.63
encourage you to imprint on your heart

3592.849 --> 3600.529
I'm searching for God the Mack let me be

3596.63 --> 3605.529
clear on that faithful are everywhere we

3600.529 --> 3609.259
won't disappear to truly no faith act

3605.529 --> 3612.349
the most important life choice from one

3609.259 --> 3616.609
you can't turn back cannot love God one

3612.349 --> 3619.579
day the next day changed Tech the path

3616.609 --> 3622.46
is an honest choice only just effect

3619.579 --> 3627.7400000000002
ready to defend in a moment's notice

3622.46 --> 3630.4700000000003
always got God's back never slack before

3627.74 --> 3632.8999999999996
you come around here saying I can't find

3630.47 --> 3633.589
this or that are you looking every

3632.9 --> 3635.78
second

3633.589 --> 3639.59
hoping God yells back

3635.78 --> 3642.0800000000004
could you handle that what if God spoke

3639.59 --> 3644.03
directly to you could you walk away from

3642.08 --> 3646.97
it intact

3644.03 --> 3650.21
please contemplate what you heard

3646.97 --> 3651.68
wherever you are at any questions I'll

3650.21 --> 3654.95
handle that

3651.68 --> 3659.02
I miss it above the only one I know I

3654.95 --> 3659.02
believe I'm sharing facts

3659.619 --> 3674.599
Wow yeah that's heavy stuff he's over

3669.5 --> 3678.08
the comments I used to have a channel on

3674.599 --> 3684.4700000000003
Twitter called well-aware at war was

3678.08 --> 3687.619
lies but I got wind that it was being

3684.47 --> 3692.2999999999997
used against me to make me look insane

3687.619 --> 3695.26
to my totally faithless family oh so I

3692.3 --> 3695.26
had to remove it

3697.12 --> 3703.54
but it will be coming back in a more

3700.48 --> 3707.19
discreet manner but everything I made

3703.54 --> 3707.19
and everything I put will be back there

3710.27 --> 3712.96
No

3716.02 --> 3723.28
yeah you're certainly making me think

3719.19 --> 3726.33
I'm like feeling like oh [ __ ] this guy

3723.28 --> 3726.3300000000004
has like a pretty

3729.49 --> 3732.0
it

3732.69 --> 3735.29
just

3736.48 --> 3741.52
you have a pretty big soul yourself and

3739.24 --> 3743.47
a pretty big mind obviously and you take

3741.52 --> 3748.96
things serious and it just makes me

3743.47 --> 3751.18
think like I have such big criticism on

3748.96 --> 3753.16
myself he had none turning it into

3751.18 --> 3756.04
something negatives not your fault it's

3753.16 --> 3758.2
just that I feel psychic like such a

3756.04 --> 3762.63
whiny complaining pants

3758.2 --> 3762.6299999999997
it's totally self-obsessed

3763.57 --> 3765.69
and

3765.95 --> 3771.47
I sometimes can't imagine that there's

3768.799 --> 3774.23
people out there that can actually adapt

3771.47 --> 3778.0989999999997
themselves into communicating with me

3774.23 --> 3780.23
because that is tough and I realize it

3778.099 --> 3784.4900000000002
when I actually bump into somebody else

3780.23 --> 3792.68
that has pretty have the issues of their

3784.49 --> 3797.0299999999997
own it's like oh I have to stop staring

3792.68 --> 3799.7
at my direct surroundings and like get

3797.03 --> 3802.88
into this person's world and move I

3799.7 --> 3804.8289999999997
should I should do it more often because

3802.88 --> 3809.079
if you don't do it enough then it

3804.829 --> 3812.599
becomes yeah the muscles for it weaken

3809.079 --> 3814.4900000000002
it's like training if you don't do it

3812.599 --> 3817.7000000000003
constantly then

3814.49 --> 3822.4399999999996
it'll yeah it'll be tough to do it again

3817.7 --> 3830.06
I was staring into myself and I

3822.44 --> 3833.7200000000003
shouldn't stare into others more but how

3830.06 --> 3838.73
about this how about this Alan my father

3833.72 --> 3841.2999999999997
sent me this two days ago some people

3838.73 --> 3845.08
will never like you because your spirit

3841.3 --> 3845.0800000000004
irritates their demons

3845.859 --> 3852.94
say again some people some people will

3850.55 --> 3863.17
never like you because your spirit

3852.94 --> 3867.08
irritates their demons right I yeah yeah

3863.17 --> 3868.76
I've always had that by the way since I

3867.08 --> 3870.8489999999997
was born I don't know how many other

3868.76 --> 3875.4700000000003
people out there have the same thing

3870.849 --> 3881.48
what I is just like a little little kid

3875.47 --> 3884.33
barely able to walk and we are like I

3881.48 --> 3887.21
would go with my parents say and my

3884.33 --> 3889.79
brother maybe two somewhere and it's

3887.21 --> 3892.25
always like whoever's gonna be there

3889.79 --> 3894.44
half of the people are gonna be totally

3892.25 --> 3897.05
endeared with me and the other half are

3894.44 --> 3899.9
like I hate this kid he is evil or

3897.05 --> 3905.119
something like it seriously and I was

3899.9 --> 3906.65
just like hey and half of them are like

3905.119 --> 3909.73
all you are amazing and the other half

3906.65 --> 3909.73
like you're evil

3912.22 --> 3919.48
but yeah you've got a good points

3916.69 --> 3926.9500000000003
and yeah it's what I reason out it's

3919.48 --> 3931.06
because of this certain the the purity

3926.95 --> 3935.25
of the light the level of purity that I

3931.06 --> 3940.38
apparently can attain naturally and that

3935.25 --> 3945.31
really freaks out some people out there

3940.38 --> 3949.2400000000002
because you can't emulate it and you

3945.31 --> 3952.0299999999997
can't hide from it and that is what

3949.24 --> 3955.6899999999996
freaks them out because demons make you

3952.03 --> 3958.65
emulate to attain power and you can't

3955.69 --> 3961.84
emulate that and you can't hide from it

3958.65 --> 3963.01
it shines through and there's nothing

3961.84 --> 3966.42
they can do with it

3963.01 --> 3966.42
really except

3967.72 --> 3977.1699999999996
be confronted with what they've done and

3973.77 --> 3980.02
that is apparently also what seems to be

3977.17 --> 3982.66
the purpose of it oh and what makes me

3980.02 --> 3985.27
quite unnerved sometimes I feel like

3982.66 --> 3989.92
yeah I am really poking some serious

3985.27 --> 3992.559
demons out there and I'm not even

3989.92 --> 3994.96
talking about people that watch Google

3992.559 --> 3997.3900000000003
Hangouts and YouTube and everything but

3994.96 --> 3999.0
just like on the other side staring

3997.39 --> 4002.3689999999997
looking around the Eye of Sauron

3999.0 --> 4006.9
watching in the other dimension and I've

4002.369 --> 4009.1800000000003
got the attention and like yeah to me

4006.9 --> 4012.809
it's like only a matter of time before

4009.18 --> 4015.0
the demons will actually start to

4012.809 --> 4018.96
approach me through other people

4015.0 --> 4021.089
physically and I'm not even saying like

4018.96 --> 4023.28
oh you're gonna ambush me but they're at

4021.089 --> 4025.109
least probably gonna walk up to me like

4023.28 --> 4026.1600000000003
who do you think you are are you Jesus

4025.109 --> 4028.2
or something hmm

4026.16 --> 4031.95
that shit's probably gonna happen at

4028.2 --> 4035.25
some point to me and I'm fully prepared

4031.95 --> 4041.5789999999997
for it as far as she can be and I'm

4035.25 --> 4044.25
gonna say like no I'm just a guy why are

4041.579 --> 4047.1600000000003
you compelled to do this what is

4044.25 --> 4049.68
compelling you to do this what is the

4047.16 --> 4056.49
pain you're hiding from when I help you

4049.68 --> 4058.319
with that no way I mean the person that

4056.49 --> 4062.4799999999996
challenges you know things are yeah I

4058.319 --> 4066.049
could do it the repercussions of that I

4062.48 --> 4066.049
wouldn't want to be then

4066.65 --> 4072.589
wait again sorry I said I feel your

4070.7 --> 4074.029
light is too strong for that and the

4072.589 --> 4077.029
repercussions of that someone

4074.029 --> 4079.009
challenging that giving in to the

4077.029 --> 4083.93
stubbornness just like the Pharaoh who

4079.009 --> 4087.739
pursued you know the Israelis across the

4083.93 --> 4090.9199999999996
Red Sea right do not he

4087.739 --> 4094.67
yeah disregard the true warning and yeah

4090.92 --> 4098.509
yeah I mean and then [ __ ] happens you

4094.67 --> 4101.65
know it that's so freaky even in in

4098.509 --> 4106.04
things that I've gone through like yeah

4101.65 --> 4109.759
somehow God sometimes reveals themselves

4106.04 --> 4114.71
especially in moments of great sin and

4109.759 --> 4117.049
that can be involving anyone it will

4114.71 --> 4119.029
reveal itself and like through the other

4117.049 --> 4122.75
dimension or something to speak to

4119.029 --> 4126.859
everyone and just say this is the

4122.75 --> 4129.259
judgment and yeah if you're gonna

4126.859 --> 4131.119000000001
believe it or not probably gonna forget

4129.259 --> 4135.679
it if you if you even consciously

4131.119 --> 4138.369
perceive it to happen like that and I

4135.679 --> 4142.06
have memories of these kind of moments

4138.369 --> 4142.0599999999995
it's really weird

4143.299 --> 4150.049
it's dark world stuff it is always weird

4145.97 --> 4152.27
I think that moment when you talked

4150.049 --> 4154.339
about the other day about face and if

4152.27 --> 4159.279
you doubt being your face can't manifest

4154.339 --> 4167.51
or it fleets yeah please from you but

4159.279 --> 4169.700000000001
out I don't doubt I just I I wouldn't I

4167.51 --> 4172.76
wouldn't worry that's why it's so many

4169.7 --> 4175.01
of the hate is silent hate and what I

4172.76 --> 4177.5
mean by that is it coming from a

4175.01 --> 4181.43
voiceless it's coming from a faceless

4177.5 --> 4183.47
nobody after sense of they can't show

4181.43 --> 4186.29
themselves I mean if someone could

4183.47 --> 4191.18
actually join and say oh any of this

4186.29 --> 4194.06
then they are labeled by that very

4191.18 --> 4197.72
action by those who support you and your

4194.06 --> 4200.18
support is growing by the day breathing

4197.72 --> 4202.85
well yeah I do in to be getting some

4200.18 --> 4204.950000000001
subscribers indeed and as I said before

4202.85 --> 4207.4400000000005
sometimes I think there's like millions

4204.95 --> 4211.88
of people watching or something it's a

4207.44 --> 4214.339999999999
weird sensation I just but I just should

4211.88 --> 4217.99
ignore that and yes stick to the number

4214.34 --> 4222.62
say for that huh be prepared for that

4217.99 --> 4226.849999999999
that's what I have no choice that's

4222.62 --> 4229.97
demeaning about it yeah what am i what

4226.85 --> 4234.64
would I do if I'd walk away except

4229.97 --> 4234.64
gather more darkness from my cowardice

4234.73 --> 4240.29
well the cowardice exists and those who

4237.77 --> 4242.900000000001
want to bad-mouth anybody who can't put

4240.29 --> 4245.2699999999995
their face to tell us to our face and I

4242.9 --> 4247.849999999999
you meet them you meet them everywhere

4245.27 --> 4250.25
you know and all different all different

4247.85 --> 4251.02
types of videos and live chats and

4250.25 --> 4254.53
things

4251.02 --> 4256.21
all right oh yeah it's easier to pull

4254.53 --> 4257.74
down on a person who's already down

4256.21 --> 4259.72
because they're trying to stand back up

4257.74 --> 4260.41
they're probably just barely on the legs

4259.72 --> 4263.59
again

4260.41 --> 4266.92
right but well I'm not gonna throw my

4263.59 --> 4269.02
[ __ ] out there if I had any doubts that

4266.92 --> 4272.41
that would prevent me from getting back

4269.02 --> 4274.570000000001
up just to be clear what I throw out

4272.41 --> 4276.76
there I threw out there because I was

4274.57 --> 4280.08
absolutely confident that I could get

4276.76 --> 4282.64
back up it just worried me because like

4280.08 --> 4287.35
it's shaking all the puppets around

4282.64 --> 4294.280000000001
basically well it goes because putting a

4287.35 --> 4298.42
ripple in the lake like a soul exactly

4294.28 --> 4300.429999999999
that you know that that's you know

4298.42 --> 4303.85
looking looking and looking you know

4300.43 --> 4308.26
different ways it's possible to see it

4303.85 --> 4314.320000000001
you know in a in many lights but it you

4308.26 --> 4316.780000000001
know yeah if it was just noise or

4314.32 --> 4321.37
whatever but it is it is a there was

4316.78 --> 4324.49
that yeah like I told you it was like if

4321.37 --> 4326.5599999999995
the person you know I just yeah it

4324.49 --> 4334.44
reached it reached a part of me because

4326.56 --> 4337.950000000001
I yeah I wish I wish

4334.44 --> 4342.839999999999
I don't know I I feel different about

4337.95 --> 4346.79
these things because you know I I have

4342.84 --> 4351.42
different mmm what's the word a

4346.79 --> 4353.58
different scope now and you know yeah

4351.42 --> 4355.77
you have arguments with people and you

4353.58 --> 4358.8
have you know fights with people and

4355.77 --> 4360.96
whatever but when you're about when you

4358.8 --> 4364.1900000000005
can lose it you know could lose it all

4360.96 --> 4366.87
like in a car crash or something yeah

4364.19 --> 4369.45
everything that you ever did you know it

4366.87 --> 4371.849999999999
just means nothing you know it just it

4369.45 --> 4376.38
just falls to the it just falls to the

4371.85 --> 4378.63
wayside because it you know there was so

4376.38 --> 4380.22
much potential and it's go over over and

4378.63 --> 4384.45
you know it's like all these things and

4380.22 --> 4386.64
you know I don't know it's given me a

4384.45 --> 4388.32
whole new lease on life and a whole new

4386.64 --> 4391.110000000001
way to look at things but like I said I

4388.32 --> 4395.84
never you said you're like yeah exactly

4391.11 --> 4401.299999999999
tional reset yeah I get that absolutely

4395.84 --> 4404.76
exactly you know and I I recorded myself

4401.3 --> 4407.01
you know a year or two before the crash

4404.76 --> 4410.58
driving down the road in which you know

4407.01 --> 4412.77
it was part of that night and I said you

4410.58 --> 4415.98
like um think you had to die you come up

4412.77 --> 4418.2300000000005
on a mystical cry and it's you know it's

4415.98 --> 4421.0199999999995
like what is what is the you know

4418.23 --> 4425.24
looking back it's like it was yeah I

4421.02 --> 4427.5
don't know is it it's like I was dancing

4425.24 --> 4429.42
dancing with the devil that night you

4427.5 --> 4431.85
know what I mean I had I had a Bible

4429.42 --> 4435.51
open on my backseat because I just felt

4431.85 --> 4436.2300000000005
so strange leaving you know leaving the

4435.51 --> 4439.650000000001
city

4436.23 --> 4443.58
I don't remember 15 minutes of the drive

4439.65 --> 4445.86
you know and it's completely gone but

4443.58 --> 4448.64
apparently I you know I did it you know

4445.86 --> 4452.53
so it's

4448.64 --> 4455.84
it's a very very special scary uncanny

4452.53 --> 4460.55
one-of-a-kind never heard it before you

4455.84 --> 4463.34
know and it drives me to challenge those

4460.55 --> 4466.1
who look at God God doesn't exist the

4463.34 --> 4468.26
ferry champ it's like really food okay

4466.1 --> 4469.97
they tell you not to call someone a fool

4468.26 --> 4472.280000000001
we might be judged the way you said it

4469.97 --> 4475.490000000001
well foolish to say there was nothing

4472.28 --> 4482.09
involved when my partner was here and so

4475.49 --> 4484.55
therefore I you know I we we the hitter

4482.09 --> 4486.71
agree to disagree or they stop talking

4484.55 --> 4488.45
to me there's never there's never a

4486.71 --> 4490.97
point where they've given me a valid

4488.45 --> 4493.639999999999
reason why God can't be in their life or

4490.97 --> 4496.52
why it isn't a new life and I think

4493.64 --> 4499.79
that's the biggest one because so many

4496.52 --> 4502.18
people have gone through so many things

4499.79 --> 4506.06
and said so many different things you

4502.18 --> 4508.280000000001
know and they want to you know they

4506.06 --> 4511.55
reminded of those things I think if they

4508.28 --> 4514.19
don't like it but the first and foremost

4511.55 --> 4517.46
you know the thing that I know is that

4514.19 --> 4522.009999999999
God wants us to be dealing kindly with

4517.46 --> 4522.01
each other you know

4522.24 --> 4529.07
that's it if we can deal kindly reach

4525.81 --> 4532.8
with each other then everybody would eat

4529.07 --> 4537.33
everybody would be warm you know if

4532.8 --> 4539.99
everybody shared a blanket we would all

4537.33 --> 4539.99
be warm

4544.28 --> 4552.2
that would seem logical you know even if

4550.13 --> 4554.0
the even if they were mandatory handed

4552.2 --> 4558.65
out by the government and you had to

4554.0 --> 4561.01
give to the alistun rights of you so

4558.65 --> 4570.259999999999
that everybody would double up and have

4561.01 --> 4572.27
you know to blanket you know so with the

4570.26 --> 4574.22
amount of money in the world and the

4572.27 --> 4578.990000000001
money in stocks and all these things

4574.22 --> 4586.45
then all I find is reasons why you know

4578.99 --> 4590.54
and you know the biggest thing about

4586.45 --> 4593.0
religion is that you agree that

4590.54 --> 4595.91
everything is of God but then you find

4593.0 --> 4598.67
some way to justify that hurting this

4595.91 --> 4601.12
person is okay or even taking their life

4598.67 --> 4603.59
is okay like like we see in these

4601.12 --> 4607.55
countries where they've taken the book

4603.59 --> 4609.83
and ran with it and with their massive

4607.55 --> 4615.05
amounts of money and power with that

4609.83 --> 4620.68
money people are subject to horrible

4615.05 --> 4625.7
lives but if you actually read each

4620.68 --> 4628.58
individual Scripture with context there

4625.7 --> 4631.429999999999
is no way in which an innocent child

4628.58 --> 4637.49
suffers an innocent woman should shriek

4631.43 --> 4642.04
in pain nothing nowhere and if you can

4637.49 --> 4647.86
show it to me then please do but I

4642.04 --> 4652.11
assure you you will not bring me a verse

4647.86 --> 4655.32
that you can read

4652.11 --> 4657.66
I probably could if I do it out of

4655.32 --> 4659.639999999999
context and that's it was always happens

4657.66 --> 4663.8099999999995
that's how it's all yeah if you don't

4659.64 --> 4666.96
get the frequency then yeah you're gonna

4663.81 --> 4670.200000000001
be stuck in a control mechanism and say

4666.96 --> 4673.62
okay yeah the situation is very familiar

4670.2 --> 4676.0199999999995
with this part of the book but I want to

4673.62 --> 4677.49
accomplish something so I'm gonna

4676.02 --> 4680.97
reference something else

4677.49 --> 4683.3099999999995
and basically display that of read for

4680.97 --> 4686.52
themselves and in that way justify it

4683.31 --> 4690.17
and that's what people do that's what

4686.52 --> 4690.17
devil persecutors do

4692.329 --> 4703.759999999999
they take from the book eight parts and

4696.05 --> 4706.34
use it as a weapon to destroy and to

4703.76 --> 4707.929
gain and yeah do everything that's

4706.34 --> 4713.09
basically wrong and that's the problem

4707.929 --> 4718.28
with a lot of religions it's the dark

4713.09 --> 4720.59
ones can get in any religion any before

4718.28 --> 4722.9
just a religion that's not Britain

4720.59 --> 4727.639
that's just a frequency that's just a

4722.9 --> 4732.829
concept and then they will try they will

4727.639 --> 4738.139
try other ways we got tin hat tinfoil

4732.829 --> 4742.25
hat destroyer this dude sucks yeah we're

4738.139 --> 4744.639
talking about Jesus Christ yeah and we

4742.25 --> 4749.09
duty to shew things in the purpose and

4744.639 --> 4752.4800000000005
seduction in us hurts it hurts so

4749.09 --> 4754.79
annoying it's so annoying but I'm still

4752.48 --> 4762.669999999999
here cuz I gotta say something behind my

4754.79 --> 4762.67
keyboard no matter what you pathetic

4762.869 --> 4771.21
it's it's really nice I wish I wish you

4766.08 --> 4776.79
could tell me to my face jump on come on

4771.21 --> 4777.78
this is noesis add me on skype first and

4776.79 --> 4783.78
I'll consider it

4777.78 --> 4785.88
yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah took a

4783.78 --> 4792.21
big game they always took a big game

4785.88 --> 4794.79
all right now it seems a lot of trolls

4792.21 --> 4797.31
are rolling in at the moment and also

4794.79 --> 4798.57
yeah we've been going for a while and

4797.31 --> 4801.030000000001
the Flat Earth debates have already

4798.57 --> 4805.29
started up so I think I'm a round out

4801.03 --> 4808.83
the show even though yeah we could

4805.29 --> 4812.4
probably talk on for hours but maybe it

4808.83 --> 4815.61
was a legit the fishes clarify something

4812.4 --> 4818.009999999999
before beef you know I there's a comment

4815.61 --> 4824.88
this is but no but it's getting very

4818.01 --> 4828.06
theoretical you know and what I asked

4824.88 --> 4831.54
you I asked I guess the theory of

4828.06 --> 4836.400000000001
whatever they're like faith and versus

4831.54 --> 4839.78
but ask yourself which verse of any

4836.4 --> 4848.489
scripture tells you to harm an innocent

4839.78 --> 4851.099
child woman or man it go away out go

4848.489 --> 4856.678999999999
away and think about that it doesn't but

4851.099 --> 4860.4890000000005
it does happen it does happen in the

4856.679 --> 4863.58
book so see there is the weird twist

4860.489 --> 4866.058999999999
ability and that's the thing I mentioned

4863.58 --> 4870.409
anyone can twist any

4866.059 --> 4873.409000000001
of the things and make it work for them

4870.409 --> 4877.159
for them of their purpose for their need

4873.409 --> 4882.739
for control the demons slipping in and

4877.159 --> 4885.799999999999
using it like a skeleton basically

4882.739 --> 4889.428999999999
picking up the bone of a skeleton and

4885.8 --> 4894.829000000001
using it as a weapon it's exactly like

4889.429 --> 4898.429
the monkey in 2001 Space Odyssey did you

4894.829 --> 4906.219
manage to look at the 717 that I told

4898.429 --> 4906.219
you to search what sorry the verse about

4906.369 --> 4912.799999999999
what the devil says after he's given the

4909.53 --> 4919.369
time of reprieve no sorry

4912.8 --> 4923.389
and good books I I will finish

4919.369 --> 4926.959
I'll finish with this and why so many of

4923.389 --> 4929.179
the weakened minds to reach hearts

4926.959 --> 4936.679
through temptation and lack of faith in

4929.179 --> 4939.26
themselves wait sir what's say again so

4936.679 --> 4941.629
I'm saying it's it's the it's it's the

4939.26 --> 4948.889
weakening through temptation and lack of

4941.629 --> 4954.439
faith in themselves that allowed the

4948.889 --> 4958.249
temptations of the devil in and so yeah

4954.439 --> 4962.959000000001
as soon as as soon as God took away the

4958.249 --> 4966.648999999999
devil's power to send you from 7:30

4962.959 --> 4969.469
he said the sin from it the heaven is

4966.649 --> 4974.119000000001
not for you to be arrogant here to part

4969.469 --> 4976.189
for you I instantly I guess he would

4974.119 --> 4979.518999999999
have become only a whisperer all of his

4976.189 --> 4981.169
power was taken away 7:14 he said grant

4979.519 --> 4983.599
me respite until the day they are

4981.169 --> 4986.659
resurrected he said you were granted

4983.599 --> 4989.4490000000005
respite he said for you having live

4986.659 --> 4992.898999999999
having sent me astray I will stalk them

4989.449 --> 4995.749
on your straight path then I will come

4992.899 --> 4997.969
to them from between their hands from

4995.749 --> 4998.49
behind them and from their right and

4997.969 --> 5001.52
from there

4998.49 --> 5006.08
you will find you will not find most of

5001.52 --> 5009.410000000001
them to be appreciative City get out of

5006.08 --> 5012.98
this get out from this you were despised

5009.41 --> 5015.7699999999995
and banished as for those among you

5012.98 --> 5018.099999999999
there among them who follow you I will

5015.77 --> 5024.530000000001
fill hell with you all

5018.1 --> 5027.650000000001
so you know it's it's about taking the

5024.53 --> 5031.19
council but not even the devil will

5027.65 --> 5033.679999999999
tempt his tempt God it's a moment he

5031.19 --> 5036.73
tells you to disbelieve he leaves you

5033.68 --> 5042.41
because he fears the Lord of the world

5036.73 --> 5048.169999999999
and this is all ready and waiting for

5042.41 --> 5051.91
the people who wish to read it but I

5048.17 --> 5055.85
tell you that time yes I tell you this

5051.91 --> 5060.83
if you're going to bad-mouth any

5055.85 --> 5065.72
religion any true person that's seeking

5060.83 --> 5070.49
to know their maker and you're going to

5065.72 --> 5072.320000000001
