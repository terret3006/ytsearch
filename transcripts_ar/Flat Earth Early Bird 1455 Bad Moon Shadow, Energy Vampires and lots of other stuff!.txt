Frosty outside

hello Mike zidernich first in chat good

165.66 --> 172.31
to see you

167.28 --> 174.959
it is Sunday the 18th of December 2022

172.31 --> 177.739
[Music]

174.959 --> 181.5
right and yeah

177.739 --> 185.4
do much better today

181.5 --> 190.2
like yesterday evening like a lot of

185.4 --> 192.959
majority of my back issues like really

190.2 --> 194.819
went away so now it's basically just a

192.959 --> 198.36
little stiff

194.819 --> 201.06
and that's it no more jolts

198.36 --> 204.59900000000002
so but now I got to be careful not to

201.06 --> 207.42000000000002
immediately like overcompensate by doing

204.599 --> 210.01899999999998
too much again so I still have to take

207.42 --> 210.01899999999998
kind of easy

210.78 --> 213.68
but yeah

214.019 --> 216.92000000000002
almost there

219.9 --> 224.70000000000002
it's very nice to just be able to kind

222.36 --> 227.76000000000002
of move around again

224.7 --> 230.75
be a bit bouncy without constantly

227.76 --> 233.64
having to worry to get shocked

230.75 --> 235.62
[Music]

233.64 --> 238.2
right

235.62 --> 240.44
so yeah how are you doing Mike's doing

238.2 --> 240.44
it

248.4 --> 255.42000000000002
right yesterday's ball busters

252.299 --> 256.979
I didn't go on live but it was kind of

255.42 --> 261.479
funny

256.979 --> 262.56
and yeah it's the entry of the Bad Moon

261.479 --> 265.56
Shadow

262.56 --> 267.78000000000003
God we even did like a live song with

265.56 --> 269.1
that it was so silly

267.78 --> 271.73999999999995
but

269.1 --> 275.46000000000004
yeah it is a good point

271.74 --> 277.74
uh Brian came up with that like was it

275.46 --> 281.94
now two weeks ago I think not sure

277.74 --> 283.44
somewhere two weeks ago and so this ball

281.94 --> 286.08
busters

283.44 --> 289.58
yeah about that

286.08 --> 289.58
and it is a very good point

291.02 --> 296.24
I mentioned it at the time on the early

293.58 --> 296.24
virtue

298.38 --> 302.699
hi doing good okay nice

300.84 --> 305.78
right so

302.699 --> 305.78000000000003
where's everybody else

308.63 --> 313.779
[Music]

319.74 --> 325.58
maybe everybody stayed up again late

322.199 --> 325.58
because it was Saturday

334.18 --> 341.22
[Music]

348.72 --> 351.72
right

352.199 --> 355.52000000000004
was I doing yesterday

365.58 --> 372.139
right yeah catching up on own Benjamin

369.3 --> 372.139
some games

373.199 --> 381.139
check out little videos

377.16 --> 381.139
like from Michael Khan and all that

382.78 --> 386.09
[Music]

391.139 --> 394.639
did I actually watch that

396.36 --> 401.3
not sure

397.979 --> 401.3
hold on let me check

401.52 --> 404.24
nope

406.8 --> 413.34000000000003
no wait no I did actually watch that I

410.4 --> 415.31899999999996
recognize the comments that's so funny I

413.34 --> 418.61999999999995
can literally recognize if I've been

415.319 --> 422.12
here before by having a

418.62 --> 422.12
sort of like icon

423.539 --> 429.59999999999997
memory like a little photograph

426.96 --> 430.73999999999995
and not like oh I know the content but

429.6 --> 434.28000000000003
just like

430.74 --> 436.56
oh what are these comments about ah

434.28 --> 437.81899999999996
I then I remembered like oh yeah I did

436.56 --> 440.9
watch this

437.819 --> 440.90000000000003
it's funny how that works

442.02 --> 445.75899999999996
it's like a little code of the time

447.36 --> 451.97900000000004
and it doesn't really matter

449.4 --> 454.62
but if you then later forget

451.979 --> 456.12
then suddenly by facing that same code

454.62 --> 460.44
it's like oh

456.12 --> 464.639
recognize it's like recognize or Deja Vu

460.44 --> 466.56
and that means I've seen it before right

464.639 --> 470.06
so that's how I

466.56 --> 474.919
yeah I know

470.06 --> 474.919
hey skeptic 936 good to see you

478.259 --> 483.74
but yeah

479.78 --> 483.73999999999995
Matt went against

483.84 --> 488.63899999999995
or he basically was responding to how

486.3 --> 490.56
some of these crazy trolls were

488.639 --> 493.199
reacting

490.56 --> 496.819
to his Bootsy video

493.199 --> 499.5
and like how sick they got with that

496.819 --> 502.139
it was pretty bizarre

499.5 --> 505.099
I mean he does get some really insane

502.139 --> 505.099
trolls apparently

508.85 --> 515.08
[Music]

517.38 --> 521.39
yeah at home Benjamin's been really

519.24 --> 525.26
interesting

521.39 --> 528.42
[Music]

525.26 --> 530.519
I'm watching some of us I've been

528.42 --> 534.66
watching like 17 minutes of his channel

530.519 --> 537.839
wait 24 minutes of his Saturday show

534.66 --> 539.279
and that blasts back some weird ass

537.839 --> 542.519
memories

539.279 --> 544.92
I mean he's on to something with that

542.519 --> 547.62
it's one of the things that I was faced

544.92 --> 551.0
with and not able to handle it

547.62 --> 551.0
when I was much younger

551.339 --> 554.94
like

553.68 --> 556.8599999999999
yeah

554.94 --> 559.0400000000001
it's kind of scary like facing that

556.86 --> 559.04
again

559.92 --> 564.54
because it brings me back to the way it

562.26 --> 569.12
felt when I first faced that

564.54 --> 569.12
I mean it's so scary and so hidden

569.64 --> 575.3389999999999
the blood-drinking [ __ ]

572.459 --> 577.5189999999999
but yeah it's an interesting show thus

575.339 --> 577.519
far

585.18 --> 589.62
right

586.62 --> 592.62
and also yeah I think I did mention a

589.62 --> 595.019
while ago that in one of my Dark World

592.62 --> 596.1
memories like that kind of happened to

595.019 --> 599.22
me

596.1 --> 600.9590000000001
like and pretty damn sure it was in the

599.22 --> 603.24
Dark World

600.959 --> 606.18
I mean it would make absolutely no sense

603.24 --> 609.0600000000001
if that was actually in my house as it

606.18 --> 610.5
looked like like absolutely no sense and

609.06 --> 612.06
there was it was like pitch black

610.5 --> 613.62
outside

612.06 --> 617.459
Dark World

613.62 --> 619.44
but basically the yeah the

617.459 --> 621.42
black Santa Claus

619.44 --> 624.48
or yeah

621.42 --> 627.899
damn it how do you call that the man in

624.48 --> 631.2
Black like in the black robe

627.899 --> 634.62
kind of a bit chubby

631.2 --> 636.6600000000001
very bearded with glasses too

634.62 --> 639.0600000000001
and it looked kind of like Jewish or

636.66 --> 641.64
something but but not like the typical

639.06 --> 645.66
that we just see hang around but it was

641.64 --> 647.88
in my dream and he like forced it on me

645.66 --> 650.3389999999999
he just like drink this

647.88 --> 651.8389999999999
and then I was like I don't wanna I was

650.339 --> 653.7
a little kid

651.839 --> 655.98
in that dream I don't even remember if

653.7 --> 658.38
it was actually during I was that I was

655.98 --> 660.0
a little kid or that in my dream I just

658.38 --> 662.9399999999999
happened to be like that

660.0 --> 665.22
but it's like really burned into me and

662.94 --> 668.1
it's just like no drink this

665.22 --> 670.2
and like I don't wanna and and he

668.1 --> 672.5400000000001
basically says but you have to

670.2 --> 674.7
and I believed it

672.54 --> 677.9399999999999
I didn't understand it

674.7 --> 681.38
and it was really [ __ ] gross

677.94 --> 681.3800000000001
and scary

681.6 --> 686.399
like that wasn't good

683.76 --> 688.5
I I just yeah

686.399 --> 690.18
it's so weird to have such a detailed

688.5 --> 693.24
memory of something I'm pretty damn sure

690.18 --> 695.2199999999999
it like never happened in real life to

693.24 --> 697.4590000000001
me

695.22 --> 697.4590000000001
foreign

697.94 --> 704.6400000000001
ass dreams when I was a kid man like

702.42 --> 707.64
and it typically happened when I faced

704.64 --> 710.8389999999999
like information I couldn't handle

707.64 --> 710.8389999999999
so bizarre

712.38 --> 717.36
[Music]

714.36 --> 717.36
anyway

722.1 --> 725.1
virus

726.24 --> 728.66
all right

732.54 --> 735.54
ah

744.75 --> 747.98
[Music]

748.38 --> 754.74
okay Larry right anyway yeah that's what

751.92 --> 757.92
that is about and like the Catholicism

754.74 --> 760.44
and tradition of drinking Christ's blood

757.92 --> 762.18
and eating his flesh and all that and

760.44 --> 765.5400000000001
where that comes from and that there is

762.18 --> 768.5999999999999
this weird thing that can happen and oh

765.54 --> 771.18
Benjamin even testifies how he ate a

768.6 --> 774.24
rabbit heart one time

771.18 --> 777.06
that he just killed and he literally had

774.24 --> 780.5600000000001
like dreams for like a week about being

777.06 --> 783.18
a rabbit which the way he was literally

780.56 --> 786.54
composing himself as he was explaining

783.18 --> 788.6999999999999
that on camera I could tell that was

786.54 --> 791.399
like a dark World Vision

788.7 --> 794.1600000000001
that wasn't just a dream it was like a

791.399 --> 797.1
real simulation

794.16 --> 798.6999999999999
it's just amazing to see that spiritual

797.1 --> 800.76
metadata

798.7 --> 802.139
[Music]

800.76 --> 805.3199999999999
yes

802.139 --> 806.82
so yeah I'm kind of like I just watched

805.32 --> 808.38
that I mean I just watched that right

806.82 --> 810.9590000000001
before the show and I'm like a little

808.38 --> 813.5
Blown Away about it

810.959 --> 813.5
huh

815.04 --> 818.899
it's cold here in the morning yeah I bet

821.279 --> 826.139
that's cool over here too

824.279 --> 828.6
it's like minus one

826.139 --> 831.839
outside right now

828.6 --> 834.12
but yeah the predictions say that

831.839 --> 837.0600000000001
tomorrow it's all gonna turn around and

834.12 --> 841.04
get much warmer like 10 degrees warmer

837.06 --> 841.04
and also rainy so

851.88 --> 856.76
all right but for now it's Rusty

856.97 --> 863.4590000000001
[Music]

859.44 --> 865.2600000000001
right so what's on your minds guys

863.459 --> 866.9399999999999
I mean I'm not getting a lot of direct

865.26 --> 868.8
feedback from what I'm talking about

866.94 --> 872.24
thus far

868.8 --> 872.24
something you want to talk about

873.65 --> 876.88
[Music]

887.88 --> 890.54
foreign

903.199 --> 908.18
Tian narcissism what

908.639 --> 911.779
never heard of that

917.399 --> 921.98
energy vampires what they do

922.079 --> 924.199
um

924.36 --> 929.88
okay skeptic very different

928.079 --> 932.42
but I can't talk about that I do know

929.88 --> 932.42
some things

932.519 --> 938.88
right energy vampires are kind of like

935.519 --> 941.76
demons in people

938.88 --> 943.139
that they

941.76 --> 946.8
use

943.139 --> 947.639
and there's a vampires need energy and

946.8 --> 951.26
so

947.639 --> 955.6800000000001
energy vampires basically try to

951.26 --> 957.899
destabilize enslave and

955.68 --> 961.5
consume

957.899 --> 964.079
the grief and other emotions depends on

961.5 --> 966.18
the nature of the vampire or the demon

964.079 --> 969.38
inside of the person

966.18 --> 969.38
or what they want

973.26 --> 979.079
right and with some people their ways

977.16 --> 982.74
will stay with them like forever because

979.079 --> 986.2199999999999
it's like entangled a very

982.74 --> 988.019
deep level and it's like they don't know

986.22 --> 989.279
who they are anymore if they wouldn't do

988.019 --> 991.62
that

989.279 --> 994.279
and or they've become too dependent on

991.62 --> 994.279
it to stop

997.019 --> 1002.12
and those usually yeah the ones that

999.66 --> 1003.139
can't stop they turn into sociopaths

1002.12 --> 1005.24
because

1003.139 --> 1007.88
having that system and doing that

1005.24 --> 1010.5790000000001
constantly desensitizes you

1007.88 --> 1014.54
because well

1010.579 --> 1017.66
you're treating people like cattle

1014.54 --> 1021.56
in a spiritual way you're prioritizing

1017.66 --> 1024.74
consumption over long-term bonding and

1021.56 --> 1028.6399999999999
so you become automatically distant

1024.74 --> 1030.98
right while having to fool people that

1028.64 --> 1033.7990000000002
you're still normal

1030.98 --> 1036.14
so yeah that you become a sociopath if

1033.799 --> 1040.04
you do if you have if you basically deal

1036.14 --> 1040.0400000000002
with energy vampiring

1044.48 --> 1047.78
just like the trolls in chat yeah very

1046.52 --> 1049.76
likely

1047.78 --> 1052.8799999999999
I mean there's all kinds of demons and

1049.76 --> 1056.799
they can provide all kinds of things

1052.88 --> 1056.7990000000002
they're basically like painkillers

1058.34 --> 1063.76
and it's funny because you can actually

1060.679 --> 1069.02
well through painkillers

1063.76 --> 1072.3799999999999
become a yeah attracted even that will

1069.02 --> 1074.539
offer to yeah that'll like is associated

1072.38 --> 1076.64
with the frequency and it's like

1074.539 --> 1079.76
what happens with

1076.64 --> 1082.6000000000001
first and foremost with uh

1079.76 --> 1082.6
oh again

1088.94 --> 1093.28
not not opium the other one

1094.82 --> 1099.86
I forgot the name it's like these types

1097.16 --> 1101.24
of painkillers with Heroin too like OPM

1099.86 --> 1104.78
is also

1101.24 --> 1107.6
under certain circumstances like yeah

1104.78 --> 1110.1399999999999
any anything that will like overwhelm

1107.6 --> 1110.1399999999999
your system

1112.94 --> 1117.6200000000001
that'll like well attract other spirits

1116.12 --> 1121.1
to you right

1117.62 --> 1124.039
yeah demons because

1121.1 --> 1127.58
if you yeah if you get an overwhelming

1124.039 --> 1129.74
sensation through like drugs through an

1127.58 --> 1132.32
unnatural reaction

1129.74 --> 1134.539
right not through social interaction and

1132.32 --> 1137.24
building up gradually

1134.539 --> 1139.8799999999999
having a mission beginning and an end

1137.24 --> 1143.299
set for your mind right just drugs just

1139.88 --> 1146.24
put it in there right well that

1143.299 --> 1149.4189999999999
destabilizes your system

1146.24 --> 1153.08
and demons will basically be looking at

1149.419 --> 1155.1200000000001
the sidelines and like oh okay so you

1153.08 --> 1157.82
really wanted that did you

1155.12 --> 1160.8799999999999
and you're okay with bypassing

1157.82 --> 1164.24
everything and doing it improperly okay

1160.88 --> 1166.4
well there's other things we can also do

1164.24 --> 1167.9
for you

1166.4 --> 1170.0590000000002
yeah and it's not like that you're

1167.9 --> 1172.2800000000002
having a conversation like that like a

1170.059 --> 1174.6789999999999
movie would typically dramatize it

1172.28 --> 1176.84
but that does effectively happen and it

1174.679 --> 1179.679
can happen in a microsecond in your

1176.84 --> 1179.6789999999999
inside your mind

1179.84 --> 1185.8999999999999
did they come

1182.0 --> 1186.679
they start to face your subconscious and

1185.9 --> 1188.96
then

1186.679 --> 1193.16
you can get entangled with it and

1188.96 --> 1195.38
contract it you contract them right you

1193.16 --> 1198.44
could see like well I contracted it like

1195.38 --> 1203.919
a disease or a contracted it like a

1198.44 --> 1203.919
spirit or a demon see the connections

1210.28 --> 1213.86
[Music]

1211.7 --> 1216.559
right

1213.86 --> 1220.28
but yeah

1216.559 --> 1222.3799999999999
energy vampirism is a really

1220.28 --> 1224.6
dumb

1222.38 --> 1227.6000000000001
pointless thing to do just naturally

1224.6 --> 1230.12
nobody would typically just do that

1227.6 --> 1232.52
unless

1230.12 --> 1233.78
they've been enslaved to somebody that

1232.52 --> 1236.36
does that

1233.78 --> 1239.059
then they're gonna take their example

1236.36 --> 1241.1599999999999
because they're already weakened and

1239.059 --> 1243.559
and then you want it you want some of

1241.16 --> 1245.8400000000001
that juice that was taken from you

1243.559 --> 1249.2
and then you start to do the same

1245.84 --> 1251.72
right but if you just grow up in a

1249.2 --> 1254.44
family that's really balanced and

1251.72 --> 1257.3600000000001
honorable and

1254.44 --> 1260.6000000000001
careful sensitive

1257.36 --> 1261.4599999999998
wise then there is no way that you're

1260.6 --> 1264.26
gonna

1261.46 --> 1268.7
naturally start you will never start

1264.26 --> 1270.98
suddenly out of nowhere doing that see

1268.7 --> 1273.919
because you're in Balance why would you

1270.98 --> 1277.94
do that why would you try to drink from

1273.919 --> 1280.22
something that you already have you see

1277.94 --> 1282.2
the energy

1280.22 --> 1286.28
so it's only when you get robbed of it

1282.2 --> 1288.8600000000001
that you will start to maybe

1286.28 --> 1291.3799999999999
oh I'm gonna rob it I'm gonna take a

1288.86 --> 1294.6399999999999
drink back because I rarely feel it and

1291.38 --> 1294.64
now I want to feel it again

1295.1 --> 1297.6399999999999
right

1298.52 --> 1303.02
the bigger picture nice

1301.34 --> 1305.6
that's exactly what I was aiming for

1303.02 --> 1308.6
skeptic I'm really glad when people

1305.6 --> 1311.6589999999999
really seriously ask questions I could

1308.6 --> 1314.559
tell I could tell by the way you

1311.659 --> 1314.5590000000002
you asked that

1318.44 --> 1321.839
[Music]

1329.96 --> 1332.14
foreign

1336.98 --> 1341.059
yeah you're welcome you're most welcome

1338.78 --> 1343.46
I'm just glad somebody's actually asking

1341.059 --> 1346.22
a good question it doesn't really happen

1343.46 --> 1348.02
that often and not blaming you like why

1346.22 --> 1350.48
aren't you continually asking great

1348.02 --> 1353.179
questions it's just that

1350.48 --> 1355.1
asking a good question because you

1353.179 --> 1357.5590000000002
really want to know and you have the

1355.1 --> 1360.26
reach to to be able to understand the

1357.559 --> 1363.3999999999999
answer you feel it that doesn't really

1360.26 --> 1363.4
happen all that often

1367.46 --> 1371.539
unless you're just like really looking

1369.679 --> 1373.52
for answers and never getting any and

1371.539 --> 1375.62
then it might keep firing because you're

1373.52 --> 1377.6
just basically desperate trying to find

1375.62 --> 1379.82
somebody that can answer but then as

1377.6 --> 1382.039
soon as they answer well then the

1379.82 --> 1384.5
mission that drove you to continually do

1382.039 --> 1386.36
that has been fulfilled and then you

1384.5 --> 1387.76
stop

1386.36 --> 1391.58
you

1387.76 --> 1393.26
yeah fall back on what yourself and what

1391.58 --> 1395.36
you're doing and what you're supposed to

1393.26 --> 1397.64
do and how to do it better

1395.36 --> 1400.6589999999999
right and then you don't get new

1397.64 --> 1400.659
questions all the time

1401.6 --> 1405.86
because a good question is basically a

1404.659 --> 1408.38
mission

1405.86 --> 1411.4399999999998
right because what's the point of asking

1408.38 --> 1414.2800000000002
a question when you wouldn't really care

1411.44 --> 1414.28
about the answer

1417.679 --> 1421.52
you can't force yourself to care

1420.14 --> 1423.7990000000002
right

1421.52 --> 1426.28
you just have to have that mission

1423.799 --> 1426.28
anyway

1427.64 --> 1430.989
[Music]

1431.26 --> 1436.8799999999999
between feeding off energy and draining

1434.659 --> 1439.159
somebody of theirs

1436.88 --> 1440.5390000000002
right well it's like what energy do you

1439.159 --> 1443.1200000000001
want to feed off

1440.539 --> 1446.36
right because everybody

1443.12 --> 1449.0
feeds of energy in some way but like

1446.36 --> 1451.8799999999999
what is it that you need

1449.0 --> 1453.98
what is the best feed what type of

1451.88 --> 1458.2990000000002
energy do you want to feed on

1453.98 --> 1459.6200000000001
right or I'd like to feed off positive

1458.299 --> 1461.9
energy

1459.62 --> 1464.0
like positive behavior

1461.9 --> 1467.02
but I know that that you have to be very

1464.0 --> 1471.5
careful in order to keep

1467.02 --> 1475.12
invoking such behavior in people

1471.5 --> 1475.12
I have to set the example

1475.49 --> 1479.96
[Music]

1477.679 --> 1482.24
right because that way of feeding is

1479.96 --> 1483.26
very stable it's very durable and it

1482.24 --> 1486.919
doesn't

1483.26 --> 1488.84
rob you of faculties or anything

1486.919 --> 1491.419
and present some new challenges because

1488.84 --> 1493.1589999999999
like are you going to hold back not to

1491.419 --> 1495.5590000000002
rob people the wrong way

1493.159 --> 1498.0800000000002
right that brings its own problem so

1495.559 --> 1499.82
it's not like oh this is the solution

1498.08 --> 1501.62
and fixes everything no no it just

1499.82 --> 1504.3799999999999
presents you with a stable foundation

1501.62 --> 1506.6589999999999
and new challenges because you always

1504.38 --> 1508.8200000000002
have to protect that

1506.659 --> 1510.5590000000002
well it's much better system than like a

1508.82 --> 1513.74
vampiric system where it's basically

1510.559 --> 1516.9189999999999
about a tyrant that can just do whatever

1513.74 --> 1520.22
they want and dominate

1516.919 --> 1525.0200000000002
and the servants the slaves

1520.22 --> 1525.02
that are subservient to them spiritually

1527.179 --> 1530.8400000000001
which is not very durable because now

1529.88 --> 1534.0200000000002
the

1530.84 --> 1537.26
yeah the the Lord or whatever the slave

1534.02 --> 1539.4189999999999
master will have maybe twice three times

1537.26 --> 1542.72
the normal energy of a human being

1539.419 --> 1545.26
because these rubbing so much

1542.72 --> 1545.26
but

1545.36 --> 1550.34
this by the way not everybody that has a

1548.179 --> 1551.3600000000001
lot of energy automatically does that by

1550.34 --> 1554.059
the way

1551.36 --> 1557.9599999999998
right it's that's complicated

1554.059 --> 1559.8799999999999
but yeah like a vampire lord usually has

1557.96 --> 1562.4
a lot of energy because he's constantly

1559.88 --> 1564.44
suppressing others and stealing theirs

1562.4 --> 1567.0800000000002
but that means there's a lot of pretty

1564.44 --> 1569.779
weak people

1567.08 --> 1573.1589999999999
and that suffer

1569.779 --> 1573.159
they have less faculties

1573.44 --> 1579.14
and it makes things worse right with

1576.919 --> 1583.8200000000002
one's very strong figure

1579.14 --> 1586.46
well to have everybody basically be

1583.82 --> 1588.62
getting a little numerology yeah numeral

1586.46 --> 1591.919
now but it's not really important like

1588.62 --> 1594.1999999999998
one and a half times the normal energy

1591.919 --> 1595.3400000000001
and everybody's pretty much on that

1594.2 --> 1598.159
level

1595.34 --> 1600.1999999999998
isn't that a much better solution

1598.159 --> 1602.5390000000002
well that's what would happen if you not

1600.2 --> 1604.4
date the vampire lord way and tour to

1602.539 --> 1605.9
have one individual left three times

1604.4 --> 1608.539
strength or maybe more but it doesn't

1605.9 --> 1611.6000000000001
really matter because it's just

1608.539 --> 1615.44
stronger they are the more exponential

1611.6 --> 1617.539
their weak prey that they feed on

1615.44 --> 1622.1000000000001
continually and would have to be

1617.539 --> 1624.98
and yeah it's just this formula for that

1622.1 --> 1627.74
but if you just don't do that

1624.98 --> 1631.22
and you just do positive reinforcement

1627.74 --> 1633.02
and learning and everybody together to

1631.22 --> 1636.08
face the challenges what they really are

1633.02 --> 1638.72
and become and everybody yeah

1636.08 --> 1641.74
the right way well then everybody can be

1638.72 --> 1641.74
a little stronger

1642.799 --> 1647.6589999999999
more symbiotic

1645.799 --> 1650.0
and instead of just a one-way

1647.659 --> 1652.5200000000002
relationship with your vampire lord

1650.0 --> 1653.92

1665.419 --> 1668.0200000000002
foreign

1674.08 --> 1682.6
and you do that decently well

1677.779 --> 1682.6
but you're you still have a a couple of

1683.6 --> 1692.299
demonic influences

1686.36 --> 1694.9399999999998
but yeah I mean most people do have some

1692.299 --> 1697.8799999999999
it's just like how well do you

1694.94 --> 1700.179
like control it and not let it ruin

1697.88 --> 1700.179
everything

1704.539 --> 1709.52
but in general I agree it could move

1706.46 --> 1711.8600000000001
virus you do you are

1709.52 --> 1714.1399999999999
you have the skill of like positive

1711.86 --> 1717.32
energy transformation

1714.14 --> 1719.96
and you're very durable I mean you can

1717.32 --> 1721.76
be spiritually slapped around and and

1719.96 --> 1725.32
literally just

1721.76 --> 1725.32
be unfazed by it

1727.65 --> 1731.44
[Music]

1729.26 --> 1734.84
right without

1731.44 --> 1737.0
secretly being very wrathful underneath

1734.84 --> 1739.1589999999999
and that's that's pretty special because

1737.0 --> 1740.72
most people that do that like for

1739.159 --> 1743.779
example Brandon can do that too but

1740.72 --> 1745.58
she's super wrathful underneath it

1743.779 --> 1748.279
and then at some point she opens that

1745.58 --> 1749.72
door and then you get like a hell scream

1748.279 --> 1752.0
of death

1749.72 --> 1755.32
through her words

1752.0 --> 1755.32
you never do that

1756.32 --> 1762.1
that's why you're allowed to hang around

1758.36 --> 1762.1
in my chat and Brenda isn't

1764.1 --> 1773.859

1775.52 --> 1779.299

1778.159 --> 1781.5800000000002
wasn't

1779.299 --> 1784.76
there at the end

1781.58 --> 1787.9399999999998
I was a little distracted

1784.76 --> 1790.52
but yeah the chat was pretty good

1787.94 --> 1791.539
I mean ball bust is usually the chat can

1790.52 --> 1794.539
be a bit

1791.539 --> 1796.57
a bit slow but it was yeah it was pretty

1867.08 --> 1872.059
that the anti-flat earthers on average

1869.0 --> 1873.26
are so gross I I literally don't want

1872.059 --> 1875.779
their stink

1873.26 --> 1878.299
to rub off on me and that's why I just

1875.779 --> 1881.84
don't address them unless it's like

1878.299 --> 1885.62
really funny and like the laughter can

1881.84 --> 1892.6999999999998

uh Carl Sagan

1905.84 --> 1912.3799999999999
Yeah Carl Sagan man I mean Carl Sagan

1910.399 --> 1915.7399999999998
probably

1912.38 --> 1918.0800000000002
like when I was much younger was part of

1915.74 --> 1919.94
the inspiration and I think I saw Carl

1918.08 --> 1922.22
Sagan like when I was eight or something

1919.94 --> 1923.8990000000001
and I think that impressed me like he

1922.22 --> 1926.779
might have been like the spark that

1923.899 --> 1931.76
caused my Baldwin

1926.779 --> 1934.22
because he's so enthusiastic about it

1931.76 --> 1936.86
and like he's really inspired and he's

1934.22 --> 1939.919
loving it couldn't you see like that man

1936.86 --> 1942.02
is not suffering that man is loving it

1939.919 --> 1946.419
they might be suffering outside of doing

1942.02 --> 1946.4189999999999
this but he loves doing that he loves

1946.539 --> 1952.6589999999999
imagining Globe stuff

1949.399 --> 1952.6589999999999

that Neil deGrasse Tyson but Neil

2043.659 --> 2046.919
deGrasse Tyson is like

2047.919 --> 2053.679
has more pizzazz

2050.8 --> 2057.96

hates ballers

2160.92 --> 2166.26
he just has no patience for them

2163.599 --> 2166.26
whatsoever

2166.9 --> 2172.599
or well anti-flat earthers and you kind

2169.9 --> 2174.4
of do fall under that but as long as

2172.599 --> 2177.76
anti-flat earthers don't start

2174.4 --> 2181.92
blabbering about ball things then yeah

2177.76 --> 2181.92
he doesn't mind it's really about that

2190.48 --> 2195.579
is he a chef no I don't think so I don't

2210.0 --> 2215.44
anti-flat Earth or tag is still funny to

2212.38 --> 2217.54
me okay well that basically means then

2215.44 --> 2219.94
that you don't really understand what it

2217.54 --> 2221.98
stands for akumu virus because it's not

2219.94 --> 2226.2000000000003
really a funny tag

2221.98 --> 2226.2
it's really a tag of the arrangement

2226.839 --> 2232.2
because it stands for obsession

2229.599 --> 2236.88
demonic Behavior

2232.2 --> 2236.8799999999997
and pathological lying

2237.54 --> 2243.04
and character assassination like without

2240.94 --> 2245.02
argumentation

2243.04 --> 2247.24
right all that so that's what that

2245.02 --> 2248.32
stands for it's not really a funny tag

2247.24 --> 2250.4199999999996
to have

2248.32 --> 2253.6600000000003
but yeah you have

2250.42 --> 2255.7000000000003
occasion when people push you you do

2253.66 --> 2257.0789999999997
absolutely start behaving like an

2255.7 --> 2261.0989999999997
anti-flat earther

2257.079 --> 2262.119
but with less of the negative traits but

2261.099 --> 2265.26
still

2262.119 --> 2265.26
you're still that

2268.87 --> 2276.42
[Music]

2271.72 --> 2276.4199999999996
anyway dietitian itself I don't know

2280.0 --> 2285.7
but it could be because he might have

2282.339 --> 2287.56
had some weight issues so he just really

2285.7 --> 2290.2
got into

2287.56 --> 2291.82
knowing about food just to get it under

2290.2 --> 2294.7599999999998
control or something

2291.82 --> 2296.56
I mean that's how I well not because I

2294.76 --> 2300.96
got overweighted but

2296.56 --> 2300.96
because of just have forcing

2301.24 --> 2306.4599999999996
realizing that

2303.82 --> 2307.96
I needed to know more about food and do

2306.46 --> 2309.4
you become more picky and careful

2307.96 --> 2311.8
because

2309.4 --> 2313.3
some of the [ __ ] in the general Foods

2311.8 --> 2316.96
out there was

2313.3 --> 2319.3590000000004
becoming a serious burden on my system

2316.96 --> 2321.7
and that way you just get to learn about

2319.359 --> 2324.52
it all right so he might have gone that

2321.7 --> 2326.9199999999996
route too it's very logical actually

2324.52 --> 2329.16
that most flat earthers go through that

2326.92 --> 2329.16
route

2332.26 --> 2335.099
forces chef

2336.579 --> 2339.2400000000002
okay

2339.52 --> 2343.56

2358.66 --> 2360.839
thank you

2370.96 --> 2377.56

2373.78 --> 2381.7000000000003
well look Chico Blanco I mean

2377.56 --> 2384.52
yes it violates like fundamental natural

2381.7 --> 2387.339
law and all that but I mean everything

2384.52 --> 2389.14
else about heliocentrism already has

2387.339 --> 2391.359
done that like

2389.14 --> 2394.06
eighty percent of the way even before

2391.359 --> 2396.839
the Big Bang came into place

2394.06 --> 2396.839
and I mean

2399.4 --> 2404.7400000000002
it's not that bad

2401.92 --> 2408.04
a solution from a heliocentric

2404.74 --> 2410.859
perspective how dare you are when how

2408.04 --> 2412.18
dare you yeah but I mean it could be

2410.859 --> 2414.8199999999997
worse

2412.18 --> 2417.5789999999997
I don't think it's all that bad and I've

2414.82 --> 2419.44
like even expanded on the idea I mean

2417.579 --> 2421.3
it's like yeah okay so what if there's

2419.44 --> 2422.5
just this giant black hole it sucks up

2421.3 --> 2425.079
everything

2422.5 --> 2427.359
would it not eventually become so

2425.079 --> 2429.76
compacted

2427.359 --> 2433.119
that it would be

2429.76 --> 2435.6400000000003
a single point of nothing and then I

2433.119 --> 2438.94
don't know for some reason it explodes

2435.64 --> 2440.98
and then it yeah like an engine Boom the

2438.94 --> 2442.78
universe starts to do its stuff again

2440.98 --> 2445.42
and then eventually black holes form

2442.78 --> 2447.76
they coalesce and then it all happens

2445.42 --> 2453.16
over again and gets sucked in and then

2447.76 --> 2453.1600000000003
Kaboom right I mean cyclical

2454.359 --> 2457.54
I don't think the Big Bang is all that

2456.46 --> 2460.119
terrible

2457.54 --> 2462.16
wrong with it heliocentric perspective

2460.119 --> 2465.1600000000003
that is I mean

2462.16 --> 2468.839
as soon as you get physics it's

2563.98 --> 2568.78
parallel lays Rays from the Sun within

much closer and

2570.339 --> 2575.44

had something for me

2648.88 --> 2652.48

2789.22 --> 2793.7799999999997
right I mean

2791.56 --> 2796.359
on the surface I would think with what

2793.78 --> 2800.46
he does like maybe he has like an offer

2796.359 --> 2805.74
for another apartment or something

2800.46 --> 2805.7400000000002

2809.98 --> 2813.0
I don't know it's weird

2814.079 --> 2817.54
because he like didn't just

2816.099 --> 2818.94
straightforward tell me what it was

2817.54 --> 2822.72
about

2818.94 --> 2822.7200000000003

planning to go there

2829.119 --> 2832.8

2847.599 --> 2850.619
that's a waste of time

2900.7 --> 2904.24
in reality

2902.74 --> 2908.0789999999997
moonlight

2904.24 --> 2910.66
has exactly the same

2908.079 --> 2913.8390000000004
yeah

2910.66 --> 2916.96
the same nature besides like the energy

2913.839 --> 2919.7799999999997
it contains but the same directionality

2916.96 --> 2921.46
and all that as sunlight there's such a

2919.78 --> 2925.2000000000003
thing as a moon dial and it works

2921.46 --> 2925.2
exactly the same as a sundial

2925.3 --> 2931.96
so like the light is like the light

2929.619 --> 2933.76
Pathways of the Moonlight is identical

2931.96 --> 2936.16
with the Sun

2933.76 --> 2939.119
well that shouldn't be in the

2936.16 --> 2939.1189999999997
heliocentrism

2939.76 --> 2945.3390000000004
in heliocentrismits claimed that the

2941.92 --> 2948.52
Moon is reflecting the Sun's light

2945.339 --> 2951.0
so how could it be of exactly the same

2948.52 --> 2951.0
nature

2951.07 --> 2954.2690000000002

2957.099 --> 2962.38

2962.38 --> 2968.1400000000003
shouldn't it be well

2964.78 --> 2970.3300000000004
literally much closer and then more much

2968.14 --> 2972.52

it'll be a sundial but at night

3013.579 --> 3021.0
well yes Godzilla but the markings are

3018.24 --> 3024.74
different because of course the Moon

3021.0 --> 3024.74
travels at the different speed

3030.06 --> 3035.4
right because the Sundial is has like

3032.94 --> 3037.26
lines on it to basically help you tell

3035.4 --> 3039.42
when is when

3037.26 --> 3041.0400000000004
well that's not really going to work you

3039.42 --> 3043.2000000000003
can't

3041.04 --> 3045.119
do that

3043.2 --> 3049.22
because the moon's well yeah you could

3045.119 --> 3049.2200000000003
if you literally go by moons

3050.22 --> 3057.24
by Moon days instead of

3054.66 --> 3059.8999999999996
Sun days

3057.24 --> 3059.8999999999996
it's weird

3060.3 --> 3067.02
but then that that wasn't even the main

3062.88 --> 3069.48
point in the show ball busters point was

3067.02 --> 3071.579
is that the light coming off the moon

3069.48 --> 3075.619
should not be

3071.579 --> 3075.619
well of the same

3075.66 --> 3080.7599999999998
assumed to be parallel nature

3078.72 --> 3083.3999999999996
as the sun

3080.76 --> 3084.8
because it's reflecting the sunlight and

3083.4 --> 3088.8
it's allegedly according to

3084.8 --> 3091.8590000000004
heliocentrism a much smaller object

3088.8 --> 3094.2000000000003
that's reflecting it reflecting that

3091.859 --> 3096.66
parallel sunlight so if it's reflecting

3094.2 --> 3100.0989999999997
that how can it still be parallel it's a

3096.66 --> 3100.0989999999997

it's certainly not empirical Chico

Blanco

3245.819 --> 3248.839
it's yeah

3248.88 --> 3251.96
that's what they do

3252.96 --> 3258.619
because you can't actually reach those

3255.0 --> 3258.619
stars or even the Sun

3261.599 --> 3267.02
so how can you know

3264.059 --> 3267.02
what it is

3269.94 --> 3273.96
I mean I'm pretty sure you can't even

3272.4 --> 3277.319
like

3273.96 --> 3280.5
pinpoint it down as to an apparition in

3277.319 --> 3283.14
a euclidean location not even that right

3280.5 --> 3284.599
there's no oh I'm going to the spot

3283.14 --> 3288.2999999999997
where I'm

3284.599 --> 3289.92
calculating it should be okay well as

3288.3 --> 3292.319
you're going there do you see the

3289.92 --> 3294.7200000000003
logically correlating angular size

3292.319 --> 3298.079
increase as you go

3294.72 --> 3298.0789999999997
no well

3298.859 --> 3306.24
then any Assumption of it even being any

3302.88 --> 3309.92
an apparition in a in a euclidean

3306.24 --> 3309.9199999999996

3310.319 --> 3317.7

stars are plasma uh no

3347.819 --> 3352.5
plasma

3349.2 --> 3355.859
is material you do realize that right

3352.5 --> 3357.3
that plasma is like a substance a

3355.859 --> 3361.7
physical material

3357.3 --> 3361.7000000000003
Well Physical material in order to

3361.74 --> 3365.7599999999998
yeah be there

3363.54 --> 3368.4
that means it would have to be in a

3365.76 --> 3369.6600000000003
euclidean position right because it's

3368.4 --> 3371.94
material

3369.66 --> 3373.02
it's not an apparition it's a material

3371.94 --> 3376.02
so

3373.02 --> 3378.48
that means it has to literally be a

3376.02 --> 3379.859
material in a euclidean position well

3378.48 --> 3383.88
then

3379.859 --> 3386.24
well you should be able to approach it

3383.88 --> 3390.92
and see an angular size increase

3386.24 --> 3390.9199999999996
and not just have it disappear

3392.579 --> 3397.02
as you approach

3394.26 --> 3399.599
because that's not what plasma would do

3397.02 --> 3404.3
if you would see it at a distance yeah

3399.599 --> 3404.3
when you see a plasma fire or something

3404.4 --> 3409.98
you see a little blip and you move

3407.28 --> 3413.2200000000003
physically towards it

3409.98 --> 3415.319
you see it get brighter and higher

3413.22 --> 3416.64
bigger angular size until you're right

3415.319 --> 3418.5
there it's right in front of you yeah

3416.64 --> 3420.839
yeah well guess what that doesn't happen

3418.5 --> 3422.28
with the Stars so you can't just say oh

3420.839 --> 3425.22
it's plasma

3422.28 --> 3428.52
because that brings in

3425.22 --> 3430.4399999999996
all kinds of things that you don't have

3428.52 --> 3432.9
it's plasma it's material that would

3430.44 --> 3433.98
mean it would have to be in a euclidean

3432.9 --> 3436.8
position

3433.98 --> 3438.839
with all the factors that come with

3436.8 --> 3441.119
things that are in euclidean positions

3438.839 --> 3442.14
like angular size increase as you

3441.119 --> 3445.44
approach

3442.14 --> 3447.72
and not just disappearing right makes no

3445.44 --> 3450.48
sense to claim that

3447.72 --> 3452.27

within heliocentric astronom

3485.52 --> 3490.44
astronomical assumption

3487.68 --> 3494.819
may have a

3490.44 --> 3496.98
a claim that it also emits heat a little

3494.819 --> 3499.64

that whatsoever

3506.22 --> 3510.5589999999997

they say

3510.9 --> 3514.4
I don't know who they are

3515.04 --> 3520.799
but I'm pretty sure that stars are not

3517.799 --> 3524.88
claimed to be plasma except maybe by

3520.799 --> 3526.619
yeah weirdo disc flat earthers or

3524.88 --> 3529.26
something

3526.619 --> 3532.44
all their dielectric nonsense and all

3529.26 --> 3535.7990000000004
that maybe they claim that I don't care

3532.44 --> 3538.319
they make a lot of stupid assumptions

3535.799 --> 3540.9
so

3538.319 --> 3543.66
right and in heliocentrism it's not

3540.9 --> 3546.599
claimed to be plasma it's claimed to be

3543.66 --> 3549.66
a giant

supposedly based on the idea of the sun

3558.119 --> 3561.96
it's

3559.02 --> 3564.24
kind of a back and forth loophole there

3564.24 --> 3568.2599999999998
both fictional

3565.799 --> 3571.92

3571.92 --> 3576.0

3572.94 --> 3578.4
what stars in the Sun is

3576.0 --> 3581.339
what the sun and the stars are claimed

3578.4 --> 3583.92

so not Material not plasma because the

plasma is basically just like a lamp

3638.099 --> 3643.319
right well there's no lamps that we know

3641.04 --> 3644.94
that you could turn on see at a vast

3644.94 --> 3651.78
suddenly you don't see it anymore huh

3649.619 --> 3655.5
show me that lamp

3651.78 --> 3657.7200000000003

3659.819 --> 3665.839
you don't see it anymore

3722.4 --> 3727.799
send in a rocket or whatever a balloon

3727.799 --> 3732.359
it's gonna disappear

3730.14 --> 3734.04
the Stars Are Gonna disappear it's just

3732.359 --> 3736.74
gonna be black

3734.04 --> 3739.94
that's that's not the sunlight drowning

3736.74 --> 3739.9399999999996
it out it's at night

3740.64 --> 3745.74

seen

3745.74 --> 3748.7
down here

3753.299 --> 3758.04

3755.64 --> 3760.5589999999997
can't see it in the daytime

3758.04 --> 3762.18
it's not drowning it out the sun isn't

3760.559 --> 3763.8590000000004

3762.18 --> 3766.859
there's no daylight

3763.859 --> 3769.68

3766.859 --> 3772.38
up there but you still you see black but

3769.68 --> 3775.6189999999997
no star so

3772.38 --> 3778.26
not drowning out of the of the sun the

3775.619 --> 3780.799
sun isn't drowning them out

3778.26 --> 3780.7990000000004
Jason

3802.98 --> 3807.66
there we go

3805.859 --> 3810.02
right which is by the way interesting

3807.66 --> 3810.02
because

3810.299 --> 3816.799
it is at least a hint right it's like oh

3813.24 --> 3820.6189999999997
it's a mystery why would that happen ah

3816.799 --> 3823.02
right well maybe it happens because

3820.619 --> 3826.26
the stars are actually well like an

3823.02 --> 3827.339
electrical effect as I have speculated

3826.26 --> 3830.7000000000003
that

3827.339 --> 3833.4
they might holographically manifest

3830.7 --> 3835.68
down here because down here is where all

3833.4 --> 3837.9
the energy is

3835.68 --> 3840.9199999999996
and so yeah

3837.9 --> 3844.38
almost going towards like fairy tale

3840.92 --> 3846.7200000000003
thinking but yeah maybe it's all the

3844.38 --> 3850.319
life down here

3846.72 --> 3854.359
right and the energies out here that

3850.319 --> 3854.359
directly influences the Stars

3857.4 --> 3862.859
I mean why

3859.46 --> 3866.099
in desert regions

3862.859 --> 3868.2799999999997
are the stars so unbelievably clear at

night

3868.859 --> 3872.339
right

3870.059 --> 3874.98
and there might still be like

3872.339 --> 3878.46
lights night lights and all that

3874.98 --> 3880.38
drowning out a bit but that still like

3878.46 --> 3882.619
it doesn't have the same influence as

3899.16 --> 3904.3799999999997
blink out at a certain well if they're a

3902.339 --> 3905.64
holographic effect which I think they

3904.38 --> 3908.819
are

3905.64 --> 3910.92
built into this realm then maybe there

3908.819 --> 3913.2
just needs to be air

3910.92 --> 3916.619
and because yeah there's no if there's

3913.2 --> 3918.1189999999997
no material then there's no electrical

3916.619 --> 3919.619
good

3918.119 --> 3922.7400000000002
guidance

3919.619 --> 3925.2200000000003
for whatever is happening

3922.74 --> 3925.22
so

3926.099 --> 3933.7200000000003
it just requires air

3929.7 --> 3936.66
and things to be there

3933.72 --> 3941.48
for the stars to manifest

3936.66 --> 3941.48
so you could theorize if you like

3943.44 --> 3950.88
if the air suddenly went away well we'll

3946.98 --> 3953.76
be dead blah you know but also the Stars

3950.88 --> 3956.46
would probably disappear

3953.76 --> 3960.8390000000004
right if the air was just like for some

3956.46 --> 3963.119
reason all gone burnt up or something

3960.839 --> 3965.96
dense great likelihood the stars are

3963.119 --> 3965.96
just gonna disappear

3973.079 --> 3977.2200000000003
so I'd like to

3974.819 --> 3979.74
study the idea

3977.22 --> 3981.8599999999997
that there is a direct

3979.74 --> 3983.5789999999997
correlation

3981.86 --> 3987.059
[Music]

3983.579 --> 3990.8390000000004
between the phenomenon of the Stars

3987.059 --> 3994.7400000000002
and the thickness of the gases

3990.839 --> 3998.48
in which they manifest to us

3994.74 --> 3998.4799999999996
is there a direct correlation

3998.88 --> 4003.859
if the atmosphere is thicker

4001.64 --> 4005.5989999999997
right and there are different regions in

4003.859 --> 4007.46
the world where the atmosphere is a

4005.599 --> 4008.6600000000003
little thicker in some places than in

4007.46 --> 4010.88
others

4008.66 --> 4013.7599999999998
right and because of different Natures

4010.88 --> 4016.339
some it may be really moist others may

4013.76 --> 4018.7400000000002
be just like very rich in oxygen because

4016.339 --> 4022.819
it's like all

4018.74 --> 4025.16
it's warm and like a lot of

4022.819 --> 4028.22
plants that really transform the air

4025.16 --> 4030.319
right so different types of gases might

4028.22 --> 4033.2599999999998
even have an influence right so you get

4030.319 --> 4036.94
different reagents with different things

4033.26 --> 4036.94
that happen different types of gas

4037.099 --> 4042.6800000000003
gas divisions percentages and pressure

4041.0 --> 4045.44
overall pressure might be different

4042.68 --> 4047.299
because of that locally right it's a

4045.44 --> 4050.0
continuous cycle things are being added

4047.299 --> 4051.319
and transformed continually so yeah if

4050.0 --> 4052.94
nothing would happen it would all even

4051.319 --> 4056.48
out but there's always something

4052.94 --> 4058.4
happening because there's life

4056.48 --> 4061.339
plants

4058.4 --> 4063.859
things happening things popping up out

4061.339 --> 4064.88
of the ground gas bubbles and all kinds

4063.859 --> 4067.46
of things

4064.88 --> 4070.46
so study these regions and just notice

4067.46 --> 4072.4
like yeah how how much is there a direct

4070.46 --> 4076.16
correlation between

4072.4 --> 4078.7400000000002
Luminosity of stars

4076.16 --> 4080.1189999999997
and

4078.74 --> 4082.7599999999998
what

4080.119 --> 4085.28
the atmosphere is like what the gas is

4082.76 --> 4086.78
what the local pressure and the gas

4085.28 --> 4089.059
content is like

4086.78 --> 4092.2000000000003
I think that would be a worthy study and

4089.059 --> 4092.2000000000003
it might actually be

4096.199 --> 4100.219
a good lead

4097.759 --> 4104.02
to start as to figuring out the

4100.219 --> 4104.02
holographic nature of the celestials

4108.319 --> 4113.4800000000005
because then you could figure out well

4110.54 --> 4116.12
how do they manifest like what under

4113.48 --> 4118.339
what conditions do they manifest and how

4116.12 --> 4122.179
much

4118.339 --> 4125.799
and then you yeah you have much more

4122.179 --> 4125.799
inter intricate data

4130.66 --> 4134.139999999999
psychedelic snowflakes

4135.679 --> 4140.779
yeah Stars can be pretty weird

4138.199 --> 4144.04
they can't be like a rainbow twinkly and

4140.779 --> 4144.040000000001
all that that's I mean

4149.199 --> 4154.5199999999995
sometimes stars are like more Prismatic

4152.299 --> 4156.99
looking

4154.52 --> 4160.450000000001
than others

4156.99 --> 4160.45
[Music]

4167.839 --> 4170.799
anyway

4178.67 --> 4184.46
[Music]

4181.279 --> 4187.0
that we are in a simulator really oh

4184.46 --> 4187.0
that's cute

4187.21 --> 4192.289
[Music]

4196.88 --> 4202.28
right but technically it's Chico Blanco

4199.46 --> 4204.9800000000005
I I agree because

4202.28 --> 4207.139999999999
it's God simulation it's the physical

4204.98 --> 4211.299999999999
reality

4207.14 --> 4211.3
physical reality is a simulation

4211.34 --> 4219.04
it's called creation

4214.219 --> 4219.04
where before it's just spirit

4223.219 --> 4227.08
right physical reality to our spirit is

4226.219 --> 4230.27
a simulation

4227.08 --> 4230.2699999999995
[Music]

4230.96 --> 4235.64
but it is real it's like the only actual

4233.54 --> 4237.98
real thing so that's why I like to say

4235.64 --> 4241.820000000001
it and that this goes back like four or

4237.98 --> 4243.199
five years call it simulatory

4241.82 --> 4247.34
because

4243.199 --> 4249.678999999999
it is the real thing but it it is like a

4247.34 --> 4251.900000000001
simulation

4249.679 --> 4254.36
yeah

4251.9 --> 4256.82
simulatory

4254.36 --> 4261.46
and that's not a real world by the word

4256.82 --> 4261.46
by the way but that's what I call it

4263.239 --> 4267.419999999999
reasons should be

4265.82 --> 4270.829
like clear

4267.42 --> 4270.829
[Music]

4284.78 --> 4289.099999999999
okay if I see your glue and yeah but you

4287.42 --> 4291.5
don't you just see a globe in your mind

4289.1 --> 4293.42
at Google virus

4291.5 --> 4296.3
right

4293.42 --> 4298.219
and a lot of the times there's not

4296.3 --> 4300.679
something done about it and the mind is

4298.219 --> 4303.8
allowed to be roam free then it will

4300.679 --> 4306.02
create an alternative reality that will

4303.8 --> 4307.6990000000005
be more real to the individual than the

4306.02 --> 4310.159000000001
actual reality

4307.699 --> 4312.739
it's called escapism

4310.159 --> 4314.719
it's very powerful once you get

4312.739 --> 4316.82
entangled with that once you start to

4314.719 --> 4319.94
believe something in your mind to be

4316.82 --> 4322.82
more real Than Physical reality

4319.94 --> 4325.96
it's also called delusion

4322.82 --> 4325.96
it can be very strong

4327.88 --> 4333.58
[Music]

4329.719 --> 4333.58
you don't see a globe yes you do

4333.679 --> 4337.76
you see the Earth as a globe in your

4335.9 --> 4339.199
mind continually that's how you look at

4337.76 --> 4341.26
the world

4339.199 --> 4344.6089999999995
everyone

4341.26 --> 4344.609
[Music]

4352.45 --> 4355.66
[Music]

4375.38 --> 4384.679
okay

4377.25 --> 4386.84
[Music]

4384.679 --> 4388.6990000000005
you could say that what did we read

4386.84 --> 4391.52
wrong because we're constantly

4388.699 --> 4392.9
referencing the empirical physical

4391.52 --> 4395.540000000001
evidence

4392.9 --> 4398.719
for our argumentation of kumu virus you

4395.54 --> 4401.06
don't you just believe it's a globe

4398.719 --> 4404.179
you believe in math which is purely

4401.06 --> 4405.620000000001
information and can take any shape in

4404.179 --> 4408.56
your mind

4405.62 --> 4411.199
and then you reinforce for yourself that

4408.56 --> 4413.56
it is a globe that's what that's what's

4411.199 --> 4413.5599999999995
happening

4413.6 --> 4418.46
so you can think that you can put that

4416.0 --> 4420.5
on to us but you can because we don't

4418.46 --> 4421.699
function that way we don't do things

4420.5 --> 4425.32
that way

4421.699 --> 4425.32
you don't just assume it

4426.8 --> 4434.360000000001
right we we look for actual empirical

4429.98 --> 4436.639999999999
evidence in the field based evidence

4434.36 --> 4438.92
and not just oh look at these

4436.64 --> 4442.280000000001
calculations oh this guy came up with

4438.92 --> 4444.4400000000005
this idea that'll fix that mathematical

4442.28 --> 4446.239
problem or bypass it and it's a better

4444.44 --> 4447.919999999999
solution

4446.239 --> 4449.718999999999
that's what you do

4447.92 --> 4453.14
you don't get out of your head it's all

4449.719 --> 4454.64
takes place in the mind the entirety of

4453.14 --> 4457.400000000001
global

4454.64 --> 4459.62
conception is just that a conception

4457.4 --> 4463.28
that takes place in the mind of people

4459.62 --> 4466.76
and that's where you go to get updates

4463.28 --> 4469.699
for how you think it should be in the

4466.76 --> 4472.159000000001
minds of people not in the physical

4469.699 --> 4473.5599999999995

what are you talking about

4508.4 --> 4511.78
our p12 vacation

4518.6 --> 4523.219
you don't think it's right to assume the

4521.96 --> 4527.7390000000005
shape of the Earth

4523.219 --> 4527.7390000000005
that's sounds very sensible

4528.92 --> 4534.38
so are you on the fence then akumu virus

4531.8 --> 4537.219
or are you gonna immediately disprove

4534.38 --> 4537.219
what you just said

4537.62 --> 4540.76
are you on the fence

4551.98 --> 4557.199

4554.659 --> 4557.199
what

4557.81 --> 4563.3
[Music]

4568.64 --> 4571.64
okay

4572.96 --> 4579.44
right so let me highlight this Okay

4575.659 --> 4583.4
Google virus says 324 I don't think it's

4579.44 --> 4584.96
right to assume the shape of the Earth

4583.4 --> 4586.879999999999
then

4584.96 --> 4587.679
after I asked the question about the

4586.88 --> 4592.52
fence

4587.679 --> 4594.9800000000005
325 no I'm not on the fence I wish it

4592.52 --> 4598.280000000001
was something different though

4594.98 --> 4600.739
that sounds like the Assumption of what

4598.28 --> 4603.08
you think it is

4600.739 --> 4604.879999999999
because of your response how you wish it

4603.08 --> 4605.659
was something different well that means

4604.88 --> 4607.64
you're

4605.659 --> 4610.099999999999
by inference

4607.64 --> 4611.659000000001
claiming that you do think you know what

4610.1 --> 4613.38

uh

4886.34 --> 4890.659000000001
what

4888.62 --> 4892.34
so when the touching is not the only

4890.659 --> 4894.32
thing that actually provides information

4892.34 --> 4896.659000000001
though Json

4894.32 --> 4900.199
but as soon as you're going to make any

4896.659 --> 4903.32
claims of physicality about it yeah then

4900.199 --> 4905.36
touching it would be a good supporting

information that we can attain in order

4926.719 --> 4933.88

right and yes to figure out if something

4944.0 --> 4950.6
is real

4946.219 --> 4952.699
a concept you first have to actually

4950.6 --> 4954.7390000000005
assume it that's right you have to start

4952.699 --> 4957.259999999999
out assuming it

4954.739 --> 4958.94
just to test like is this a thing right

4957.26 --> 4962.8
I mean

4958.94 --> 4966.08
even a hypothesis in science is

4962.8 --> 4968.179
basically an assumption you're assuming

4966.08 --> 4971.179
something is gonna

4968.179 --> 4972.1990000000005
influence something right and then you

4971.179 --> 4974.42
test it

4972.199 --> 4975.62
that starts with an assumption then the

4974.42 --> 4977.36
test

4975.62 --> 4979.599999999999
there's no assumption then there's no

4977.36 --> 4979.599999999999
test

4981.56 --> 4986.360000000001
right because you have to be specific in

4983.6 --> 4987.8
order to be that specific you would have

4986.36 --> 4990.98
to assume

4987.8 --> 4992.4800000000005
within the hypothesis that something is

4990.98 --> 4995.62
going to happen and then you test it

4992.48 --> 4995.62
whether it does or doesn't

4996.26 --> 4999.26
foreign

5001.96 --> 5007.6
of course that's not the only

5003.9 --> 5009.82
restriction within the scientific

5007.6 --> 5012.360000000001
hypothesis

5009.82 --> 5012.36
but

5013.96 --> 5018.06
it is part of it so yeah you

5018.28 --> 5023.259999999999
you can't

5019.6 --> 5024.660000000001
learn things without assuming something

5023.26 --> 5027.979
to test it

5024.66 --> 5027.979
[Music]

5029.8 --> 5034.659000000001
right but if you're just assuming it and

5032.14 --> 5036.820000000001
not testing it then you're not going to

5034.659 --> 5038.699
attain Knowledge from it you're just

5036.82 --> 5041.9
gonna keep assuming it

5063.94 --> 5070.678999999999

5151.54 --> 5157.06
yeah that was a fake turret

5154.659 --> 5159.219
see that's what happens when you start

5157.06 --> 5162.1
addressing the trolls

5159.219 --> 5163.96
I mean you literally did it and you

5162.1 --> 5165.46
didn't remove your messages you don't

5163.96 --> 5168.4
you guys some of you guys just don't

5165.46 --> 5171.94
seem to be taking this serious

5168.4 --> 5175.48
yeah this is the [ __ ] that happens when

5171.94 --> 5177.46
you literally give them recognition for

5175.48 --> 5180.82
existing

5177.46 --> 5184.3
so when you see me ban a troll and not

5180.82 --> 5186.28
address it you don't go oh boy true but

5184.3 --> 5188.679
yeah guess what the [ __ ] happens when

5186.28 --> 5191.139
you do that dummy

5188.679 --> 5193.179
this happens

5191.139 --> 5195.34
you get it yet

5193.179 --> 5197.7390000000005
I mean how many times does this have to

5195.34 --> 5200.52
happen before you finally get that you

5197.739 --> 5200.5199999999995
shouldn't do that

5210.34 --> 5215.1990000000005
and would never say something like that

5212.38 --> 5217.36
so but that's fine I'm not blaming you

5215.199 --> 5219.159
for mistaking

5217.36 --> 5221.32
him

5219.159 --> 5224.86
for a troll

5221.32 --> 5230.0199999999995
I'm blaming you for addressing trolls

5224.86 --> 5232.78
before before this started to happen

5230.02 --> 5236.46
right the first troll came in I banned

5232.78 --> 5239.139
him and two of you literally started

5236.46 --> 5241.6
yelling at him in my chat yeah guess

5239.139 --> 5244.32
what the [ __ ] happens when you do that

don't exist

when you do that

they stop

them to not exist provably

6669.179 --> 6673.86
these shoes down there that

6671.699 --> 6676.58
if I just sit there for a long time

6673.86 --> 6681.739
these muscles still do get sore

6681.739 --> 6686.4
hmm

6684.139 --> 6688.7390000000005
but maybe that's also going to change

6686.4 --> 6690.9
when the weather changes around I mean I

6688.739 --> 6693.78
bet that the whole freezing situation

6690.9 --> 6696.239
does have an influence on this condition

6693.78 --> 6698.719
it literally started when it started

6696.239 --> 6698.718999999999
freezing

6698.82 --> 6703.44
last week when it like really started

6701.1 --> 6705.679
freezing and it was still frozen in the

6703.44 --> 6705.678999999999

6706.159 --> 6710.219
that's when that happened

6708.78 --> 6714.239
typical

6710.219 --> 6717.06
maybe that's also why I hate ice skating

6714.239 --> 6719.04
because when do you when do you go out

6717.06 --> 6722.46
ice skating remember how I was talking

6719.04 --> 6724.619
about how I hate ice skating so much

6722.46 --> 6726.6
well maybe it's not even because of the

6724.619 --> 6729.119
ice skating maybe it's because well when

6726.6 --> 6731.58
do you go ice skating Well when things

6729.119 --> 6733.259999999999
are frozen out there

6731.58 --> 6735.3
what happens when things are frozen

6733.26 --> 6737.88
aren't there well I typically like

6735.3 --> 6740.34
spraying my back

6737.88 --> 6742.159000000001
so maybe that's the reason why I hate

6740.34 --> 6745.4400000000005
ice skating

6742.159 --> 6747.719
because that happens

6745.44 --> 6750.299999999999

6747.719 --> 6752.94
when I go out ice skating because it

just sit

6876.36 --> 6883.259999999999

6902.699 --> 6907.699
yeah I mean break dancing is really

6908.1 --> 6912.0
like

6909.659 --> 6914.94
you logically really shouldn't do it

6912.0 --> 6917.219
after you're 25 or something unless I

6914.94 --> 6920.94
guess you're professional and all that

6917.219 --> 6922.619
about it because it really works great

6920.94 --> 6925.0199999999995

6925.02 --> 6928.46
becomes way too risky

6928.8 --> 6932.2390000000005
and that starts pretty quick

6932.699 --> 6938.78
I mean I used to be like unbelievably

6935.28 --> 6938.78
flexible as a kid

6943.92 --> 6949.1990000000005
felt almost like I was like half a cat

6947.219 --> 6951.179
or something sometimes because I was

6949.199 --> 6952.619
just so flexible and like never had

6951.179 --> 6955.619
issues and then

6952.619 --> 6958.199
yeah then in my teens already like the

6955.619 --> 6960.36
first weird issue started happening back

6958.199 --> 6961.919999999999
screening happened for the first time

6960.36 --> 6964.88
like when I was

6961.92 --> 6964.88
12 or something

6970.44 --> 6976.138999999999
man that was so incredibly painful that

6973.679 --> 6977.34
first time like literally just crying

6976.139 --> 6978.659000000001
out like

6977.34 --> 6980.179
torture

6978.659 --> 6983.699
it's terrible

6980.179 --> 6986.34
but when you get older you're like

6983.699 --> 6988.44
you get used to it and it's not that

6986.34 --> 6990.84
pain it's still freaking painful and

6988.44 --> 6992.879999999999
it's more burdensome but it's not that

6990.84 --> 6994.860000000001
painful as when like happens the first

6992.88 --> 6997.32
time when you're young that is such a

6994.86 --> 6999.179
nightmare I still remember how I was

6997.32 --> 7002.0599999999995
like out of my mind

6999.179 --> 7004.9400000000005
so painful

7002.06 --> 7008.2390000000005
I think they doped me or something they

7004.94 --> 7012.82
put like Valium in me

7008.239 --> 7012.82

things about it

7042.5 --> 7047.06
foreign

7044.659 --> 7049.5199999999995
what's a good food to eat when you're

7047.06 --> 7052.52
feeling muscle spasm and joint pain well

7049.52 --> 7054.7390000000005
that's very obvious really

7052.52 --> 7056.96
chili pepper

7054.739 --> 7058.28
the hotter the better

7056.96 --> 7061.76
right

7058.28 --> 7064.94
muscle spasms pains all these things are

7061.76 --> 7067.099
all because of a lack of bleeding right

7064.94 --> 7069.259999999999
that's why it almost never happens in

7067.099 --> 7071.719
the summer because it's hot your blood

7069.26 --> 7074.4800000000005
has like a lot more room to basically

7071.719 --> 7075.92
get everywhere when it's winter it's

7074.48 --> 7078.98
cold

7075.92 --> 7082.46
you cramp up to generate heat but that

7078.98 --> 7084.32
also restrains the blood flow so

7082.46 --> 7087.9800000000005
chili

7084.32 --> 7089.84
like I had chili yeah what is it last

7087.98 --> 7092.178999999999
week

7089.84 --> 7093.9800000000005
they even made it as I had my back issue

7092.179 --> 7096.619
but it it helped like even as I was

7093.98 --> 7098.54
eating that that helped so much

7096.619 --> 7101.5599999999995
it made it a lot better it helped

7098.54 --> 7104.86
recover and on top of that yeah

7101.56 --> 7107.599
turmeric you can of course use turmeric

7104.86 --> 7111.219
on top of that

7107.599 --> 7111.219
so that's my recommendation

7114.56 --> 7121.159000000001
right muscles joint issues of any sort

7117.92 --> 7125.54
turmeric chili pepper chili pepper for

7121.159 --> 7127.759999999999
the bleeding for the blood flow which

7125.54 --> 7131.0
helps restore it quicker

7127.76 --> 7134.860000000001
and turmeric for well for

7131.0 --> 7134.86
ligaments joint issues

7140.9 --> 7145.58
right and by the way that keeps working

7142.639 --> 7148.219
it's not like you could basically just

7145.58 --> 7150.92
like eat it on a daily basis if you

7148.219 --> 7153.7390000000005
really happen to like it like people in

7150.92 --> 7157.9400000000005
India probably do a lot

7153.739 --> 7161.919999999999
and it would always keep working

7157.94 --> 7161.919999999999

7183.56 --> 7188.719
right and in general staying warm I mean

7186.98 --> 7190.94
when it's just food

7188.719 --> 7192.8
yeah chili pepper right that's already

7190.94 --> 7194.48
helping the blood flow it will probably

7192.8 --> 7196.820000000001
heat you up a bit it's going to be very

7194.48 --> 7199.159
nice I mean have you ever had it's like

7196.82 --> 7200.38
deadly cold and you're eating chili and

7199.159 --> 7203.119
then you get like

7200.38 --> 7205.400000000001
and then it's like whoa it's not cold

7203.119 --> 7208.78
anymore yeah

7205.4 --> 7214.889999999999
chili it's awesome when it's really cool

7208.78 --> 7214.889999999999
[Music]

7216.92 --> 7223.159
canopy yeah dude you can do there's

7220.159 --> 7224.659
Peppers out there that are crazy hot but

7223.159 --> 7227.44
you got to be careful though not to

7224.659 --> 7227.44
overplay it

7227.54 --> 7233.06
but like yeah Madame Jeanette

7231.199 --> 7236.32
I mean

7233.06 --> 7239.360000000001
whatever happens make sure you do not

7236.32 --> 7241.699
accidentally rub it in your eye because

7239.36 --> 7244.299999999999
you might be hospitalized it's that

7241.699 --> 7244.299999999999
freaking hot

7247.76 --> 7253.34
so yeah there's there's a lot of hot

7250.699 --> 7255.44
Peppers out there and you have to

7253.34 --> 7256.76
basically attune it to like how much you

7255.44 --> 7261.0199999999995
can handle

7256.76 --> 7263.2390000000005
I mean there's like Asians and Mexican

7261.02 --> 7265.400000000001
Hispanic people that are like well bring

7263.239 --> 7268.459999999999
it on they'll just freaking chew down in

7265.4 --> 7271.638999999999
Madame Jeanette right well if if a

7268.46 --> 7275.44
typical European blonde haired guy did

7271.639 --> 7279.92
that date probably like get hospitalized

7275.44 --> 7284.239
so you gotta basically fine tune how

7279.92 --> 7288.639
much pepper you can and want to handle

7284.239 --> 7288.638999999999
don't don't overdo it

7291.38 --> 7297.679
right yeah but I make my chili uh vegan

7294.86 --> 7299.719
by the way I used to always do chili con

7297.679 --> 7302.4800000000005
carne and put beef in it I don't do that

7299.719 --> 7305.9800000000005
anymore I replace the beef with carrot

7302.48 --> 7305.98
and it's excellent

7306.199 --> 7311.239
so how I make it is

7309.08 --> 7314.719
it's a lot of work

7311.239 --> 7316.419999999999
what I basically take carrots make them

7314.719 --> 7319.46
into like a

7316.42 --> 7322.4
quarterize them into little blocks

7319.46 --> 7325.94
quarters a lot of it it's like the

7322.4 --> 7331.46
bottom of the of the pan then olive oil

7325.94 --> 7331.46
in there garlic freshly squeezed uh

7332.199 --> 7337.659
Mediterranean herbs this is a certain

7335.36 --> 7340.46
blend it's perfect for it

7337.659 --> 7341.96
uh bullion

7340.46 --> 7344.06
cubes

7341.96 --> 7346.04
for the salt base

7344.06 --> 7349.599
uh

7346.04 --> 7352.82
start basically with that oh yeah Laurel

7349.599 --> 7353.96
Leaf in there if you have it then start

7352.82 --> 7356.48
with that

7353.96 --> 7359.119
start cooking that

7356.48 --> 7361.04
then add onion

7359.119 --> 7365.679
uh

7361.04 --> 7365.679
make sure it all just really goes then

7368.719 --> 7374.78
right then the red kidney beans wait no

7372.5 --> 7378.5
I start out with the maze

7374.78 --> 7380.0599999999995
or with the corn like corn on water put

7378.5 --> 7382.94
it in there just to put all the juices

7380.06 --> 7384.5
all of it in there right then after that

7382.94 --> 7386.419999999999
the beans

7384.5 --> 7389.48
well maybe not all the juice because

7386.42 --> 7392.36
that gets really gooey but some of it

7389.48 --> 7394.82
for sure because it's pretty nutritious

7392.36 --> 7398.5599999999995
and it's already quite a big pen then

7394.82 --> 7398.5599999999995
you eventually add a

7401.2 --> 7412.159
[Music]

7408.58 --> 7416.739
squash is that called squash okay weird

7412.159 --> 7420.219
we call it courgette which is the French

7416.739 --> 7420.218999999999
original word

7420.619 --> 7427.699
right squash of the gourd family okay

7425.3 --> 7430.28
put that in there it's great it's like

7427.699 --> 7431.659
it really absorbs the flavor it it's

7430.28 --> 7435.5599999999995
very nutritious

7431.659 --> 7437.619
then take at the end

7435.56 --> 7441.219
I add some

7437.619 --> 7441.219
pineapple blocks

7442.119 --> 7447.32
a little and everything in little blocks

7444.679 --> 7449.96
just put it all in there oh yeah I

7447.32 --> 7453.199
forgot the chili pepper of course with

7449.96 --> 7456.32
the first part garlic

7453.199 --> 7457.098999999999
carrots and the chili pepper like right

7456.32 --> 7459.199
away

7457.099 --> 7461.719
so that is like all drenched through

7459.199 --> 7463.4
everything and it a lot of it like fresh

7461.719 --> 7465.08
Chili Peppers

7463.4 --> 7467.239
cut them up

7465.08 --> 7469.28
like and into little blocks like

7467.239 --> 7471.44
everything goes into little blocks and

7469.28 --> 7473.179
then it's like perfectly divided every

7471.44 --> 7475.759999999999
it's a lot of work

7473.179 --> 7478.659
but it's so great and I've eaten like

7475.76 --> 7478.659000000001
four days of it

7479.36 --> 7486.94
so that's what how I make my chili

7483.44 --> 7489.5599999999995
it's completely vegan and it's very nice

7486.94 --> 7491.299999999999
like you don't you can't really tell

7489.56 --> 7494.06
that there's no meat in it it's like

7491.3 --> 7496.08
don't care it's great

7494.06 --> 7500.85
foreign

7496.08 --> 7500.85
[Music]

7507.58 --> 7510.88
what okay

7514.699 --> 7517.178999999999
Curry

7517.28 --> 7522.86
right

7519.56 --> 7526.76
oh yeah hot curry is basically

7522.86 --> 7531.28
pepper and turmeric and some other stuff

7526.76 --> 7531.280000000001
in there so that is like yeah

7533.599 --> 7535.84
foreign

7538.659 --> 7542.42
bread

7540.56 --> 7545.26
okay

7542.42 --> 7545.26
yeah why not

7549.139 --> 7553.219
I mean you could like put it in tacos or

7551.659 --> 7556.219
burritos too

7553.219 --> 7559.34
just what I described making if if you

7556.219 --> 7562.34
have like good burrito dough

7559.34 --> 7565.639
because the organic variety seems like

7562.34 --> 7568.719
it it always breaks immediately

7565.639 --> 7568.719
it's kind of annoying

7570.02 --> 7573.219
[Music]

7573.5 --> 7579.86
anyway food talk

7575.9 --> 7581.96
you enjoyed that the chili

7579.86 --> 7584.659
it's a really good chili recipe I mean

7581.96 --> 7587.54
it's like two hours work or something

7584.659 --> 7590.839999999999
but then you have well

7587.54 --> 7592.88
for pretty big meals that are very

7590.84 --> 7594.679
especially first days amazingly

7592.88 --> 7595.88
nutritious when you just eat it when you

7594.679 --> 7599.86
just made it

7595.88 --> 7599.86
but still it like if you

7601.46 --> 7606.86
put it in the cooler scoop some out and

7604.82 --> 7609.799999999999
heat that in a smaller pan and you can

7606.86 --> 7613.098999999999
eat it and that way it's like still very

7609.8 --> 7615.679
nutritious even at the last day

7613.099 --> 7617.38
and that's yeah some of the type of

7615.679 --> 7620.0
dinners that I make

7617.38 --> 7621.92
[Music]

7620.0 --> 7624.02
and it really has a time and a place I

7621.92 --> 7627.4400000000005
mean if I would have to like eat chili

7624.02 --> 7629.719
like every month like that

7627.44 --> 7631.879999999999
I would not like it anymore and I used

7629.719 --> 7633.619
to I I got a time where I was very

7631.88 --> 7635.719
repetitive with my meals it's like

7633.619 --> 7638.659
around 2008 and it was basically only

7635.719 --> 7641.36
making spaghetti and chili con carne

7638.659 --> 7642.799999999999
and it was like getting really boring to

7641.36 --> 7645.86
me

7642.8 --> 7648.320000000001
at some point but now I hadn't eaten

7645.86 --> 7650.839999999999
chili in like

7648.32 --> 7653.96
half a year or something

7650.84 --> 7655.219
and it was like yeah man this is so

7653.96 --> 7657.8
fantastic

7655.219 --> 7659.54
right if you keep eating it all the time

7657.8 --> 7663.159000000001
then yeah it's gonna get kind of boring

7659.54 --> 7663.159
but pretty much anything would

7667.58 --> 7670.239
right

7670.58 --> 7676.3
so all of you are off to the kitchen

7672.86 --> 7679.58
rushing to make some snacks I guess

7676.3 --> 7680.900000000001
I guess I would too if I

7679.58 --> 7685.09
heard

7680.9 --> 7688.389999999999
story about how to make dinner

7685.09 --> 7688.39
[Music]

7691.219 --> 7696.58
if you crush the garlic

7693.98 --> 7696.58
what

7697.88 --> 7702.08
Oh you mean there's an oxidization

7699.86 --> 7704.299999999999
reaction

7702.08 --> 7707.0599999999995
that's interesting psych bear I always

7704.3 --> 7710.96
crush garlic by the way

7707.06 --> 7714.860000000001
except for when I make like

7710.96 --> 7716.54
like the ginger chicken

7714.86 --> 7718.759999999999
stew

7716.54 --> 7720.5
and then I cut it into blocks little

7718.76 --> 7723.34
blocks because everything is little

7720.5 --> 7723.34
blocks in there

7723.5 --> 7726.98
but yeah with everything else I always

7725.78 --> 7729.5
crush it

7726.98 --> 7731.0599999999995
I didn't know that if you left it in the

7729.5 --> 7733.84
open that didn't have some reaction

7731.06 --> 7733.84
that's interesting

7736.04 --> 7738.58
huh

7739.639 --> 7745.28
is it because of oxygenation

7743.119 --> 7748.239
it's like where

7745.28 --> 7748.239
or something else

7758.54 --> 7762.58
now listen all right

7764.719 --> 7767.619
foreign

7769.58 --> 7775.58
but yeah I do like garlic but I also

7772.699 --> 7778.219
know not to overdo it

7775.58 --> 7781.04
right because

7778.219 --> 7784.46
if you just eat garlic all the time then

7781.04 --> 7786.679
like your bacteria you have bacteria all

7784.46 --> 7790.3
over you they are also going to be

7786.679 --> 7790.3
burdened by it if you overdo it

7791.599 --> 7796.6990000000005
like if you just eat too much garlic all

7794.48 --> 7798.32
the time especially if you like eat it

7796.699 --> 7801.98
raw right

7798.32 --> 7804.139
to let you like don't heat it in a meal

7801.98 --> 7805.82
but if you like eat it raw like in

7804.139 --> 7808.58
garlic sauce if you like if you would

7805.82 --> 7810.799999999999
eat garlic sauce every day that's not

7808.58 --> 7812.719
just some prefab crap but with actual

7810.8 --> 7814.6990000000005
fresh garlic which is pretty strong if

7812.719 --> 7817.599
you eat that every day you'd get gut

7814.699 --> 7817.598999999999
Flora issues

7818.3 --> 7822.52
so you can't eat garlic all the time

7823.52 --> 7826.96
just gonna do it sometimes

7827.119 --> 7832.699
and if you do that then well I can like

7830.239 --> 7835.159
feel it like my body's calling for

7832.699 --> 7836.96
garlic there there needs to be a garlic

7835.159 --> 7839.48
dosage

7836.96 --> 7843.159
and then I I try to

7839.48 --> 7843.159
get some meal with garlic

7848.96 --> 7854.02
and garlic sauteed

7851.42 --> 7854.02
poof

7854.38 --> 7864.139
well I've been making like uh

7858.98 --> 7867.28
french fries Allah war or potato as they

7864.139 --> 7867.28
call it here in Neelam

7867.32 --> 7872.84
and that's basically

7870.08 --> 7876.28
price that I make of course in olive oil

7872.84 --> 7879.619000000001
it's all organic mayonnaise

7876.28 --> 7883.699
little pieces of onion

7879.619 --> 7885.38
and then satay sauce like peanuts peanut

7883.699 --> 7890.178999999999
sauce

7885.38 --> 7893.0
yeah that's french fries with war

7890.179 --> 7897.099
is what it's called a grape

7893.0 --> 7897.099
very nice like when it's cold

7902.0 --> 7905.719
you know it's so funny right I mean

7903.619 --> 7908.92
that's so Dutch it's like a Dutch thing

7905.719 --> 7912.139
you can order that at a snack bar

7908.92 --> 7914.719
lock it's very typically Dutch

7912.139 --> 7917.659000000001
and then I just realized like wait I can

7914.719 --> 7920.3
actually just make that myself

7917.659 --> 7922.5199999999995
why would I restrict that from only ever

7920.3 --> 7923.96
getting that at like some snack bar

7922.52 --> 7926.540000000001
which I don't really go to anyway

7923.96 --> 7929.78
anymore because none of them are organic

7926.54 --> 7933.199
so why not just make it organic myself

7929.78 --> 7936.04
it was a really good idea I very much

7933.199 --> 7936.04
appreciated it

7937.699 --> 7942.678999999999
hmm

7940.36 --> 7944.179
right but I think I'm gonna round out

7942.679 --> 7946.76
man I've been going over two hours

7944.179 --> 7949.719
already I can't believe it the food talk
