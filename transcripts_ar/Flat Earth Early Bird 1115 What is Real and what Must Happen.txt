355.28 --> 358.88
it's not super eventful

360.08 --> 363.59999999999997

yeah i can really

636.56 --> 640.3199999999999
see what that was about

638.24 --> 643.32
but yeah i did have a notification of

640.32 --> 643.32
that

662.48 --> 665.2
okay okay

666.16 --> 672.16
everyone can ask one question and they

669.04 --> 674.05
all start with can i ask

672.16 --> 675.8389999999999
one question only

674.05 --> 679.5999999999999
[Laughter]

675.839 --> 679.6
okay yeah that sounds kind of funny

683.04 --> 686.12
all right

696.959 --> 699.68
oh man

699.92 --> 703.8389999999999

just

706.32 --> 708.48
my back is

707.6 --> 710.9590000000001
like

708.48 --> 713.519
being difficult i think i just need to

710.959 --> 716.7199999999999
really take a shower or something hot

713.519 --> 719.279
that might help

716.72 --> 721.2
like this muscle between your rib is

719.279 --> 724.16
acting up kind of since yesterday i

721.2 --> 724.1600000000001
don't even know why

724.32 --> 730.9200000000001
but like it's not

727.12 --> 730.92
it's just a bit of a nuisance

735.36 --> 739.279
it's better now anyway than it was

737.519 --> 744.12
yesterday night i thought like i'm gonna

739.279 --> 744.12
have a back problem there again but no

744.639 --> 747.639
uh

780.32 --> 784.1600000000001
yeah so you can stir water i'll i'll

782.399 --> 786.48
pause jiren's clip if you want to take a

784.16 --> 789.68
look at it

786.48 --> 790.8000000000001
i haven't watched it myself yet but yeah

789.68 --> 793.04
jaren's

790.8 --> 795.519
doing great

793.04 --> 797.1999999999999

795.519 --> 801.2
interview

797.2 --> 801.2
show yesterday he had with nathan

812.839 --> 817.839
stoben don't know if jaren's like

815.12 --> 819.92
recorded anything about it

817.839 --> 822.24
it'll probably be like on rockfin or

819.92 --> 826.3199999999999
anything but yeah i saw it in the live

822.24 --> 826.32
that doesn't usually hang around

827.36 --> 832.399
like maybe there's a replay still

829.839 --> 832.399
available

842.24 --> 848.24
right anything

844.72 --> 848.24
interesting happening out there

850.639 --> 855.0
i'm a bit zoned out

896.079 --> 899.079
hmm

910.959 --> 913.959
um

934.5 --> 937.669
[Music]

953.759 --> 956.0
right

954.72 --> 958.1600000000001
so guys

956.0 --> 961.44
want to talk about something

958.16 --> 961.4399999999999
bring a subject maybe

962.72 --> 967.519
may every thought be true to you

966.0 --> 971.16
uh

967.519 --> 971.16
what does that mean

982.959 --> 985.199
huh

985.279 --> 989.279
okay at least you yeah that sounds nice

991.199 --> 995.199
right well once the birds start to

993.12 --> 996.72
figure out like there's a certain spot

995.199 --> 998.4799999999999
where there is

996.72 --> 1000.0
food

998.48 --> 1001.9200000000001
available

1000.0 --> 1003.759
where there's feeding yeah then other

1001.92 --> 1006.24
birds will kind of like take note of

1003.759 --> 1006.24
that too

1007.12 --> 1010.48
that sounds cool

1008.72 --> 1014.279
this kind of the same situation as what

1010.48 --> 1014.279
i got here on the roof

1040.72 --> 1043.72
ugh

1087.84 --> 1091.6789999999999
anyone seeing supermarkets running out

1089.76 --> 1094.919
of food nope

1091.679 --> 1094.919
i'm not

1099.039 --> 1102.84
hello jeff gassett

1120.4 --> 1124.4
yeah a raccoon

1122.48 --> 1127.039
okay

1124.4 --> 1129.3600000000001
well yeah at least you you are kind of

1127.039 --> 1133.08
in the middle of nature so

1129.36 --> 1133.08
but that's really cool

1137.76 --> 1140.76
hmm

1172.4 --> 1175.4
hmm

1194.559 --> 1199.28
put a little oh cool gee i appreciate

1197.44 --> 1203.0800000000002
that i like your little videos that just

1199.28 --> 1203.08
sent me through the mail

1214.559 --> 1217.559
okay

1233.679 --> 1236.679
hmm

1282.72 --> 1285.72
hmm

1299.1 --> 1302.23
[Music]

1302.4 --> 1307.3600000000001
huh

1305.039 --> 1309.039
okay that's weird running out of cat

1307.36 --> 1309.9189999999999
food

1309.039 --> 1311.44
that

1309.919 --> 1312.5590000000002
that's very odd

1311.44 --> 1317.799
because

1312.559 --> 1317.799
it's very easy to make cat food overall

1318.64 --> 1326.6000000000001
that must be a logistics issue then

1321.84 --> 1326.6
if it's just cat food it's weird

1334.48 --> 1337.48
ah

1349.039 --> 1352.08
not at the cat food eating stage yet

1351.039 --> 1355.44
yeah

1352.08 --> 1355.4399999999998
number 26 there

1355.76 --> 1359.8799999999999
kids cat oh god

1399.6 --> 1404.08
hmm

1400.48 --> 1404.08
yeah maybe lsg maybe

1404.4 --> 1408.48
maybe it is like a

1406.159 --> 1410.4
was a planned thing

1408.48 --> 1413.64
could be

1410.4 --> 1413.64
hey wrath

1463.88 --> 1466.999
[Music]

1467.039 --> 1471.12
hey

1468.159 --> 1471.1200000000001
flatter sage

1471.52 --> 1474.24
hello hello

1475.84 --> 1479.84
certainly

1477.039 --> 1479.84
quite a crowd

1480.32 --> 1484.6399999999999
yeah i'm not

1482.48 --> 1486.32
well you must have noticed

1484.64 --> 1489.3600000000001
i don't particularly have a lot of

1486.32 --> 1491.52
energy i mean

1489.36 --> 1493.76
i'm still kind of bottling up emotions a

1491.52 --> 1493.76
bit

1494.4 --> 1497.3600000000001
i don't want to

1496.4 --> 1500.88
get go

1497.36 --> 1503.84
into that like no i refuse to do that

1500.88 --> 1503.8400000000001
two days in a row

1507.039 --> 1512.799
but yeah i'll probably recover somewhere

1509.84 --> 1514.8799999999999
halfway the show

1512.799 --> 1518.1589999999999
and like

1514.88 --> 1520.4
get my thinking going again

1518.159 --> 1524.3600000000001
because right now it's just there's not

1520.4 --> 1524.3600000000001
really a lot coming out

1530.96 --> 1533.2
hmm

1536.4 --> 1541.679
all right by the way

1538.559 --> 1545.6789999999999
even if i'm like this on my own show

1541.679 --> 1548.4
like i'm pretty sure that i'm gonna be

1545.679 --> 1551.799
just fine when i participate on

1548.4 --> 1551.799
flatter's debate

1560.08 --> 1563.9189999999999
angle of attention to a curve

1569.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
yeah yeah

1574.48 --> 1580.0
but at this point it's just like super

1577.76 --> 1584.64
basic geometry now

1580.0 --> 1586.48
right it's just super basic geometry and

1584.64 --> 1588.4
the anti-flat earth just

1586.48 --> 1590.96
can't yeah you don't really know what to

1588.4 --> 1590.96
do with that

1591.84 --> 1598.49
i mean the sextant and its operation

1596.32 --> 1599.84
really proves the earth is flat

1598.49 --> 1601.84
[Music]

1599.84 --> 1604.6399999999999
like the black swan proved

1601.84 --> 1607.52
the earth is not that ball

1604.64 --> 1610.96
well so does just the

1607.52 --> 1613.84
basic operation of the sextant proof it

1610.96 --> 1613.8400000000001
is flat

1627.679 --> 1630.0
huh

1631.12 --> 1635.8799999999999
okay at least yeah that sounds cool

1643.97 --> 1647.19
[Music]

1677.55 --> 1681.44
[Music]

1685.05 --> 1688.6399999999999
[Music]

1690.559 --> 1693.559
hmm

1731.919 --> 1736.48
yeah

1733.2 --> 1736.48
all right seek star wars

1737.279 --> 1741.6

1739.2 --> 1746.679
are you eating that cold

1741.6 --> 1746.6789999999999
or you are warming up it up

1753.2 --> 1758.0800000000002
troll alert yeah

1755.6 --> 1758.08
a little

1760.96 --> 1764.679
ballers have awoken

1769.36 --> 1772.36
oh

1786.159 --> 1789.159
so

1811.76 --> 1814.76

1847.48 --> 1851.2
[Music]

1848.96 --> 1851.2
just

1853.96 --> 1857.059
[Music]

1862.84 --> 1867.12
chattering hey what was that

1898.32 --> 1901.32
hmm

1927.36 --> 1931.0
hey tony whitcomb

1943.679 --> 1946.679
uh

[Music]

1985.12 --> 1988.4799999999998
wow yeah so you can start one that

1986.72 --> 1992.559

1988.48 --> 1992.559
that's not how i would make chilean

1998.64 --> 2003.2
curved adjacent doesn't matter really

2003.44 --> 2008.279
oh it on a globe it kind of does

2035.12 --> 2040.1589999999999
thinking of making a bunch of blue steel

2037.36 --> 2043.24
wrenches for mods that's that is funny

2040.159 --> 2043.24
at least

2050.8 --> 2055.28
sexton can use a bubble level yeah yeah

2053.119 --> 2059.679
but they didn't though

2055.28 --> 2059.679
they didn't that happened much later

2069.919 --> 2075.2799999999997
all right so how did they get around and

2072.079 --> 2078.639
explore the world

2075.28 --> 2078.639
without that bubble level

2079.44 --> 2084.32
because pretty damn sure they didn't

2081.359 --> 2088.04
have those back in like the

2084.32 --> 2088.04
16th century

2121.839 --> 2125.68
yeah tony whitcomb yeah of course

2123.599 --> 2128.56

2125.68 --> 2131.44
in response to the black swan

2128.56 --> 2133.599
if it's even realized

2131.44 --> 2135.04
for what it is right then they go to

2133.599 --> 2136.7200000000003
that

2135.04 --> 2138.4
but

2136.72 --> 2140.8799999999997
i don't know a lot of ballers don't even

2138.4 --> 2140.88
go there

2142.48 --> 2148.8
like some might mention like no it's

2146.32 --> 2151.6800000000003
it's refracted but they don't really

2148.8 --> 2153.28
understand the full implications of that

2151.68 --> 2155.1189999999997
they don't really have an oversight to

2153.28 --> 2159.0
the effect it's kind of they're just

2155.119 --> 2159.0
using it like an excuse

2161.28 --> 2166.52
they don't really have it all modeled in

2163.28 --> 2166.52
their head

2174.56 --> 2177.56
so

2190.16 --> 2193.16
mm-hmm

2226.8 --> 2232.52
hello otto flick 1310 what

2254.32 --> 2257.839
oh right right

2287.28 --> 2291.2000000000003
the cranes are wobbly

2290.16 --> 2293.68
yeah but

2291.2 --> 2295.359
the thing is that the cranes are being

2293.68 --> 2298.3999999999996
wobbly

2295.359 --> 2300.3199999999997
is a straw man

2298.4 --> 2303.119
because

2300.32 --> 2306.0
it doesn't matter like the state of the

2303.119 --> 2308.1600000000003
visibility of any objects

2306.0 --> 2310.16
that you might see

2308.16 --> 2311.68
the only thing that matters is the

2310.16 --> 2315.7599999999998
horizon

2311.68 --> 2318.3199999999997
the visible horizon within the picture

2315.76 --> 2320.7200000000003
because that doesn't change

2318.32 --> 2323.7200000000003
in relation to the supposed actual

2320.72 --> 2323.72
horizon

2327.04 --> 2331.92
the best content on youtube is this show

2329.68 --> 2333.9199999999996
oh yeah because i'm not just non-stop

2331.92 --> 2335.2000000000003
rambling tim osman

2333.92 --> 2338.56
yeah i know

2335.2 --> 2341.4399999999996
i have a this is kind of raw

2338.56 --> 2343.44
and in ways very much so i don't give a

2341.44 --> 2346.7200000000003
[ __ ] like i don't give a [ __ ] i'll just

2343.44 --> 2348.32
be literally silent

2346.72 --> 2351.4399999999996
for half an hour

2348.32 --> 2355.04
non-stop just say hello or hey

2351.44 --> 2357.599
that's it yeah

2355.04 --> 2357.599
that's right

2359.04 --> 2361.839
i mean if i could

2360.64 --> 2364.72
actually

2361.839 --> 2367.04
put something down without breaking i

2364.72 --> 2367.04
would

2367.68 --> 2371.359
sometimes

2369.119 --> 2372.8
i need a little spark from an anti-flat

2371.359 --> 2374.88
earther

2372.8 --> 2376.96
to get me going

2374.88 --> 2379.52
and sometimes i just have all the room

2376.96 --> 2379.52
in the world

2381.44 --> 2385.52
but yeah

2383.359 --> 2386.3199999999997
why don't you try to do

2385.52 --> 2390.32
a

2386.32 --> 2393.3590000000004
every day show every day

2390.32 --> 2395.76
at the same time slot every day the same

2393.359 --> 2398.24
time slot not a show

2395.76 --> 2399.5200000000004
somewhere in the day whenever you feel

2398.24 --> 2402.0
like it no

2399.52 --> 2404.0
the same time slot every day

2402.0 --> 2406.24
for three years you try something like

2404.0 --> 2411.64
that and see how

2406.24 --> 2411.64
smooth and ever talking you're gonna be

2418.8 --> 2423.8390000000004
right but hey on this show

2421.76 --> 2425.0400000000004
things do

2423.839 --> 2426.64
get yeah

2425.04 --> 2428.88
float up

2426.64 --> 2432.0
things always stand out to me and

2428.88 --> 2434.48
especially in the silence

2432.0 --> 2436.48
if it's not all that rowdy we're not all

2434.48 --> 2438.96
caught up in a certain train of thinking

2436.48 --> 2440.64
that we're engaging in

2438.96 --> 2444.4
yeah

2440.64 --> 2444.4
that's the time to pick up things

2444.8 --> 2451.319
so even the silence of my show in its

2447.44 --> 2451.319
own right has a function

2452.0 --> 2455.599
but yeah when it comes to

2454.0 --> 2456.72
showmanship

2455.599 --> 2458.0
or

2456.72 --> 2459.1189999999997
i don't know

2458.0 --> 2461.599
media

2459.119 --> 2463.52
training you could say it referencing to

2461.599 --> 2465.2000000000003
don't look up right

2463.52 --> 2468.319
yeah i am

2465.2 --> 2470.7999999999997
super raw super inconvenient

2468.319 --> 2470.8
and like

2471.359 --> 2474.7999999999997
unnervingly

2472.88 --> 2477.599
direct

2474.8 --> 2480.1600000000003
with like personal things that most

2477.599 --> 2481.2000000000003
people spend their entire lives hiding

2480.16 --> 2483.5989999999997
it

2481.2 --> 2485.68
from even recognizing it exists to

2483.599 --> 2489.3590000000004
anybody else yeah

2485.68 --> 2489.359
i lay that down here

2490.48 --> 2497.359
like actually raw not in

2494.56 --> 2499.44
row i'm so noisy

2497.359 --> 2501.359
i'm not gonna cook this time i'm so

2499.44 --> 2505.52
noisy no as in

2501.359 --> 2508.56
actually literally raw as in almost me

2505.52 --> 2510.4
as a person cannot escape in a cage i

2508.56 --> 2513.2799999999997
will be presented

2510.4 --> 2517.0
that kind of raw that's what i am that's

2513.28 --> 2517.0
what my show is

2545.359 --> 2551.2
yeah i've been through all my old video

2547.52 --> 2553.2
games look at the horizon

2551.2 --> 2555.5989999999997
worked out a way to represent what we

2553.2 --> 2558.16
see in reality a flat horizon yeah but

2555.599 --> 2559.76
all the computer game models especially

2558.16 --> 2561.04
the 3d

2559.76 --> 2562.6400000000003
type games

2561.04 --> 2565.839
they're all flat

2562.64 --> 2565.839
all of it

2567.2 --> 2572.319
i mean they could have made

2569.76 --> 2575.0400000000004
computer games 3d games

2572.319 --> 2577.2799999999997
based on like a globe model guess what

2575.04 --> 2579.68
happens and this i think this is like

2577.28 --> 2582.079
even officially studied at some point

2579.68 --> 2584.56
that they did it tested it out kind of

2582.079 --> 2587.2000000000003
kept it under the rug

2584.56 --> 2590.4
do it on an actual

2587.2 --> 2591.4399999999996
supposedly to scale earth model

2590.4 --> 2593.6800000000003
sphere

2591.44 --> 2595.76
like put that in the simulation in the

2593.68 --> 2597.2799999999997
computer game well first off it's very

2595.76 --> 2600.4
tough

2597.28 --> 2602.2400000000002
to actually arrange everything

2600.4 --> 2604.4
on a ball

2602.24 --> 2606.72
with the architecture the

2604.4 --> 2609.92
3d design that's really difficult to

2606.72 --> 2611.4399999999996
actually achieve so it's more work

2609.92 --> 2613.839
second off

2611.44 --> 2615.76
when the players would then engage in

2613.839 --> 2616.88
such a world setup guess what's going to

2615.76 --> 2622.48
happen

2616.88 --> 2624.319
they all get sick they all get sick

2622.48 --> 2625.68
from playing the game

2624.319 --> 2629.2799999999997
why

2625.68 --> 2631.7599999999998
because it looks absolutely unnatural

2629.28 --> 2635.0400000000004
that's why

2631.76 --> 2637.8390000000004
because the earth is in the ball right

2635.04 --> 2639.119
people are used to thinking the earth is

2637.839 --> 2642.64
a ball

2639.119 --> 2645.44
but not seeing the earth as a ball

2642.64 --> 2647.7599999999998
not having to orientate and adapt to

2645.44 --> 2651.2000000000003
your environment

2647.76 --> 2653.5200000000004
on the earth being a ball not that part

2651.2 --> 2655.7599999999998
you can't get used to that it's actually

2653.52 --> 2658.48
it literally makes you sick and

2655.76 --> 2658.48
nauseated

2658.8 --> 2663.76
and that's why computer game

2661.2 --> 2666.96
industries don't do that right oh it's

2663.76 --> 2668.6400000000003
in space it's on a planet yeah yeah but

2666.96 --> 2670.079
oh you're gonna go to the ground and

2668.64 --> 2673.359
actually do something there oh guess

2670.079 --> 2674.4
what that planet is gonna be a flat

2673.359 --> 2675.52
plane

2674.4 --> 2677.359
yeah

2675.52 --> 2679.52
they have to do that

2677.359 --> 2682.0789999999997
because if it was literally a ball you'd

2679.52 --> 2682.079
get sick

2684.24 --> 2688.7999999999997
right unless there's like a special

2686.56 --> 2690.96
point you're walking around in a space

2688.8 --> 2693.3590000000004
suit like on some meteoroid that's

2690.96 --> 2695.2
really large

2693.359 --> 2696.72
because then they're making a point with

2695.2 --> 2699.9199999999996
that

2696.72 --> 2699.9199999999996
but as soon as it's like

2700.4 --> 2704.8
yeah

2701.68 --> 2707.1189999999997
livable planet sized environment that

2704.8 --> 2708.88
you're pre-supposedly going

2707.119 --> 2711.44
it can't be a ball

2708.88 --> 2713.599
in the actual rendered environment

2711.44 --> 2718.2000000000003
they can say it's a ball but it can't

2713.599 --> 2718.2000000000003
look like a ball it would make you sick

2727.56 --> 2732.16
imperator rome

2730.079 --> 2734.96
yeah but that's

2732.16 --> 2737.2
that's a strategy game isn't it that's a

2734.96 --> 2739.599
top-down view strategy game that's not a

2737.2 --> 2742.72
first-person game right

2739.599 --> 2742.7200000000003
aries 106.

2742.88 --> 2747.7200000000003
huh

2744.24 --> 2747.72
it's very different

2749.599 --> 2756.079
you don't spend the entire game

2752.24 --> 2758.8799999999997
in the eyes of the soldiers or whatever

2756.079 --> 2761.8390000000004
you have a top-down view yeah then

2758.88 --> 2761.839
do whatever you want

2766.0 --> 2770.4
right i personally kind of like

2767.359 --> 2774.56
civilization five because it has a

2770.4 --> 2777.56
very very distinct rectangular looping

2774.56 --> 2777.56
map

2814.96 --> 2818.96
right as soon as you're in a game with

2816.96 --> 2821.44
some top-down view you're not going to

2818.96 --> 2824.56
see the horizon

2821.44 --> 2824.56
as a horizon

2824.64 --> 2828.72
you're going to be looking down

2826.72 --> 2832.7999999999997
on well a plane

2828.72 --> 2834.72
or maybe they're curving it a bit

2832.8 --> 2836.96
but you're not going to see the horizon

2834.72 --> 2839.9599999999996
in such a

2836.96 --> 2839.96
simulation

2872.559 --> 2878.52
all right aries 106.

2874.88 --> 2878.52
you brought it up

2898.44 --> 2901.51
[Music]

2903.28 --> 2909.079
hey eric one one one

2906.079 --> 2909.079
one

2926.839 --> 2930.48
hmm

2928.8 --> 2932.079
all right i just get

2930.48 --> 2934.64
apparently nathan

2932.079 --> 2937.2000000000003
oakley is starting a flat earth debate a

2934.64 --> 2937.2
bit late

2941.2 --> 2945.359
so yeah i don't know if

2943.28 --> 2948.0
i'm gonna be more fluid now i do feel

2945.359 --> 2950.7999999999997
better than like

2948.0 --> 2950.8
an hour ago

2952.48 --> 2957.04
more able to engage

2954.319 --> 2959.839
yeah then maybe my show can just go on a

2957.04 --> 2961.2
little longer as well

2959.839 --> 2963.359
i don't know

2961.2 --> 2965.359
we'll see i was kind of sorry yesterday

2963.359 --> 2967.7599999999998
to round out the show

2965.359 --> 2971.44
because yesterday when yeah it kind of

2967.76 --> 2973.5200000000004
emotional break and [ __ ]

2971.44 --> 2977.28
empathic break

2973.52 --> 2979.52
but after that i got really focused

2977.28 --> 2981.6800000000003
and so yeah it was kind of

2979.52 --> 2984.0
almost like ah damn it i could go on

2981.68 --> 2986.0789999999997
another half hour like this but yeah the

2984.0 --> 2988.559
flat earth debate was starting

2986.079 --> 2988.559
too bad

2988.96 --> 2993.16
can't always get what you want

3004.559 --> 3010.0
okay well that's new to me ares 106.

3007.839 --> 3013.319
never heard of that that's another game

3010.0 --> 3013.319
by the way

3019.92 --> 3025.599
but a bunch of

3022.88 --> 3028.559
first person game but what type of first

3025.599 --> 3028.559
person game is it

3031.68 --> 3035.5989999999997
i mean if it's like an action game where

3033.76 --> 3039.7200000000003
you constantly have to master your

3035.599 --> 3039.7200000000003
environment and all that

3043.04 --> 3048.72
exploration well right

3045.52 --> 3048.72
well that's different then

3053.04 --> 3058.24
right because all the real action games

3055.52 --> 3059.839
shooters and all that they can't do that

3058.24 --> 3061.1189999999997
it would make you sick because you're

3059.839 --> 3062.96
constantly

3061.119 --> 3067.319
quickly trying to

3062.96 --> 3067.319
assess the virtual environment

3069.119 --> 3075.44
so like your senses dig in

3073.28 --> 3076.96
intuitively and if things are wrong

3075.44 --> 3079.28
you'll pick up on it like there's

3076.96 --> 3081.68
something unnatural happening

3079.28 --> 3085.0400000000004
on an intuitive level because that game

3081.68 --> 3087.359
kind of compels you to do that

3085.04 --> 3090.0
if it's exploration

3087.359 --> 3092.24
it's more like a view spectacle thing

3090.0 --> 3094.8
and you don't have any urgency that's

3092.24 --> 3096.7999999999997
pushing you to quickly size things up

3094.8 --> 3099.2000000000003
right it's not an action game it's

3096.8 --> 3099.2000000000003
different

3103.44 --> 3107.359
anyway yeah

3104.8 --> 3108.1600000000003
fine so it doesn't make you sick

3107.359 --> 3110.5589999999997
right

3108.16 --> 3111.5989999999997
i don't think i said everybody get sick

3110.559 --> 3112.3190000000004
from it

3111.599 --> 3113.839
but

3112.319 --> 3115.119
a majority

3113.839 --> 3116.319
of people

3115.119 --> 3118.559
did

3116.319 --> 3122.0
because there have been tests in this

3118.559 --> 3125.0
like in the 90s even i think

3122.0 --> 3125.0
so

3125.68 --> 3132.52
no proof of that i was just interested

3129.28 --> 3132.52
and told

3157.52 --> 3162.44
outer world definitely has balls in it

3166.16 --> 3169.16
okay

3182.559 --> 3186.8
right well i'm not really interested in

3184.48 --> 3187.92
a new computer game so i'm not gonna

3186.8 --> 3189.599
check it out

3187.92 --> 3192.599
i was just trying to make a point

3189.599 --> 3192.599
originally

3214.4 --> 3218.319
hey steven traveler

3216.88 --> 3221.319
what's going on

3218.319 --> 3221.319
ah

3223.119 --> 3225.839
i don't know

3229.119 --> 3235.559
i still feel a little like yesterday but

3231.44 --> 3235.559
like not as bad as that

3238.24 --> 3244.72
and yeah i'm just getting these

3242.319 --> 3244.72
slow

3245.359 --> 3250.24
mornings

3247.68 --> 3251.7599999999998
it's not really morning literally but to

3250.24 --> 3253.68
me it is

3251.76 --> 3256.0
and just

3253.68 --> 3259.2799999999997
slowly

3256.0 --> 3262.72
very slowly start to start up

3259.28 --> 3262.7200000000003
and usually as soon as

3263.04 --> 3268.4
like the evening is up

3265.52 --> 3270.0
and the sun is down then i just

3268.4 --> 3271.119
go

3270.0 --> 3273.92
i become

3271.119 --> 3276.92
much more awake

3273.92 --> 3276.92
eh

3287.599 --> 3291.119
which is by the way also the thing that

3289.2 --> 3294.0
kind of tends to keep me up at night

3291.119 --> 3298.1600000000003
late because it doesn't really stop

3294.0 --> 3298.16
until basically the day breaks again

3298.799 --> 3304.4
i have to kind of force myself like no

3300.96 --> 3304.4
no you're going to bed now

3304.96 --> 3308.4
because otherwise i'd stay up until

3306.96 --> 3310.559
accidentally you notice it start

3308.4 --> 3312.2400000000002
becoming light again

3310.559 --> 3313.8390000000004
which in the past has happened quite a

3312.24 --> 3317.04
lot

3313.839 --> 3320.04
as in 10 years ago i'm more

3317.04 --> 3320.04
12.

3326.799 --> 3329.799
do

3340.799 --> 3343.799
so

3359.41 --> 3363.14
[Music]

3376.0 --> 3378.319
yeah

3378.96 --> 3382.16
what else

3380.48 --> 3383.76
what are you talking about you try to

3382.16 --> 3386.319
force

3383.76 --> 3387.84
the line experiment

3386.319 --> 3390.999
in dayz

3387.84 --> 3390.9990000000003
[Music]

3392.24 --> 3396.319
so you actually try to measure the

3394.559 --> 3399.0400000000004
virtual environment in there that's

3396.319 --> 3399.04
hilarious

3414.24 --> 3421.1189999999997
any plans for new year's eve well yeah

3416.48 --> 3421.119
i'll do a new year's eve

3421.28 --> 3425.76
celebration little show as i usually do

3426.16 --> 3429.16
sure

3439.359 --> 3442.359
mm-hmm

3447.2 --> 3451.839
yeah i can't imagine at least g it is

3449.52 --> 3451.839
huge

3452.319 --> 3457.92
but that's just really funny that you

3454.4 --> 3457.92
even like came up with that

3458.88 --> 3462.079
that's probably easier ways to do it you

3460.88 --> 3464.0
know

3462.079 --> 3467.2000000000003
i mean

3464.0 --> 3470.64
there's like complete wireframe

3467.2 --> 3475.48
data coordinates for like entire models

3470.64 --> 3475.48
of every non-moving object there

3476.0 --> 3480.559
available you can often just

3478.319 --> 3484.88
afterwards somewhere

3480.559 --> 3487.2000000000003
find the model for in a 3d program

3484.88 --> 3491.04
so you can literally have it exactly as

3487.2 --> 3493.2799999999997
it is in certain insert it in the game

3491.04 --> 3496.96
you don't have to manually get into the

3493.28 --> 3499.52
game and then start measuring things

3496.96 --> 3505.15
if you really wanted to know

3499.52 --> 3508.329
try to find the model for the map

3505.15 --> 3508.329
[Music]

3527.28 --> 3530.15
oh yeah ps4

3529.119 --> 3533.04
right

3530.15 --> 3536.96
[Music]

3533.04 --> 3536.96
yeah you can't look it up on a ps4

3540.96 --> 3543.96
oh

3546.72 --> 3551.7599999999998
oh blocks

3548.88 --> 3555.96
no i have heard of that

3551.76 --> 3555.96
i don't remember what it is

3565.839 --> 3571.4
oh

3566.72 --> 3571.3999999999996
right it's like a lego game right

3589.44 --> 3593.2400000000002
and then

3599.57 --> 3602.7090000000003
[Music]

3604.64 --> 3609.839
build virtual worlds

3606.4 --> 3611.52
right okay well they're not the first

3609.839 --> 3613.44
those types of games have been around

3611.52 --> 3616.559
for

3613.44 --> 3616.559
yeah quite a while

3619.28 --> 3623.6800000000003
was this one game i thought it was like

3621.04 --> 3626.799
2010

3623.68 --> 3629.04
for ps3 i think it was

3626.799 --> 3631.68
yeah

3629.04 --> 3633.44
or it was even like on online tablets

3631.68 --> 3636.64
and everybody was playing that where you

3633.44 --> 3638.559
could literally just build a

3636.64 --> 3641.52
side scroller style

3638.559 --> 3643.28
environment like with a lot of details

3641.52 --> 3645.92
you could put all kinds of [ __ ] in there

3643.28 --> 3649.3590000000004
and just do whatever you like

3645.92 --> 3651.599
it was really popular at the time

3649.359 --> 3653.44
so yeah

3651.599 --> 3656.6800000000003
but that's

3653.44 --> 3656.68
side scrolling

3678.319 --> 3684.24
make a good 3d game that simulates yeah

3680.96 --> 3687.599
but can they though aries like they'd

3684.24 --> 3687.5989999999997
almost have to trick it

3690.16 --> 3694.319
kind of like google does with google

3692.079 --> 3695.8390000000004
maps right you zoom out oh it's a globe

3694.319 --> 3697.7599999999998
and then you zoom in

3695.839 --> 3700.0
no it's not a globe anymore that's not

3697.76 --> 3702.0
what a globe looks like

3700.0 --> 3704.0
but it is what it really looks like so

3702.0 --> 3707.359
they have to have like a transition

3704.0 --> 3707.359
mechanic for the visuals

3707.44 --> 3710.16
to trick you

3711.599 --> 3715.04
yeah that's not going to be easy

3718.96 --> 3722.48
all right woodworking gunny bear

3723.52 --> 3727.16
that's an old one

3732.96 --> 3737.079
all right

3733.76 --> 3737.079
be right back

3844.16 --> 3847.16
um

3853.599 --> 3856.599
hmm

3865.0 --> 3872.459
[Music]

3889.44 --> 3892.44
uh

3904.64 --> 3907.64
uh

3932.24 --> 3934.5589999999997
hmm

3934.799 --> 3940.52
premiering

3937.2 --> 3940.52
what's this

3944.99 --> 3949.1499999999996
[Applause]

3952.49 --> 3964.3999999999996
[Music]

3960.799 --> 3966.24
that was an audible stomach was it

3964.4 --> 3970.039
okay

3966.24 --> 3970.0389999999998
i can't really tell

3980.64 --> 3983.7599999999998
oh

3982.079 --> 3985.92
yeah hello random explorer good to see

3983.76 --> 3985.92
you

3986.96 --> 3993.559
glad you were able to avoid the storms

3990.16 --> 3993.5589999999997
with your location

3999.839 --> 4004.64
are you low on food supply

4002.48 --> 4006.64
no stomach growl is actually a good sign

4004.64 --> 4009.359
it means that i'm getting over my

4006.64 --> 4011.0389999999998
morning sickness

4009.359 --> 4014.4
which have been kind of

4011.039 --> 4018.3590000000004
burdening me in the last few months

4014.4 --> 4018.359
especially last month

4033.2 --> 4038.64
i have a cousin here

4036.48 --> 4040.48
but i don't really feel like eating it

4038.64 --> 4042.0789999999997
right now

4040.48 --> 4045.079
but i will

4042.079 --> 4045.079
somewhere

4054.96 --> 4062.359
hopefully the body will adjust well i

4057.039 --> 4062.3590000000004
think it's am i pregnant yeah very funny

4063.61 --> 4066.659
[Music]

4067.28 --> 4073.119
it's mostly my empathy and the time of

4069.68 --> 4074.96
year and when i call the ancestral winds

4073.119 --> 4076.7200000000003
i'm not the only one that's bothered by

4074.96 --> 4079.359
this

4076.72 --> 4081.9199999999996
but they seem to be hitting very hard

4079.359 --> 4081.92
this year

4084.16 --> 4089.2799999999997
but i think it also has to do with

4086.079 --> 4091.6800000000003
basically my entire

4089.28 --> 4093.76
mental and spiritual position within my

4091.68 --> 4096.88
own body

4093.76 --> 4099.279
compared to the last few years

4096.88 --> 4099.279
because

4099.6 --> 4104.679
in ways i'm more focused except

4104.719 --> 4107.92
it drains more too

4108.4 --> 4112.48
and right now it's just like yeah

4112.88 --> 4118.2390000000005
there's so much to talk about yet

4116.159 --> 4121.12
i cannot find the right angle of

4118.239 --> 4124.159
approach for almost any of it

4121.12 --> 4126.719
so i'm mostly now just being kind of

4124.159 --> 4129.04
responsive

4126.719 --> 4130.64
i just address what other people are

4129.04 --> 4134.56
talking about

4130.64 --> 4134.56
because that doesn't have to like

4135.12 --> 4138.96
that doesn't have as much impact

4141.44 --> 4146.12
it's very easy for me to do that

4151.199 --> 4154.199
so

4165.839 --> 4172.08
not celestial winds ancestral winds it's

4169.759 --> 4175.44
a spiritual thing

4172.08 --> 4177.6
and it's not environmental

4175.44 --> 4180.96
has to do with just the energies and the

4177.6 --> 4182.88
way the light is it's purely spiritual

4180.96 --> 4186.08
purely it's no

4182.88 --> 4187.679
physical correlation

4186.08 --> 4189.6
or well yeah

4187.679 --> 4191.4400000000005
no physical causation

4189.6 --> 4195.96
there's correlations of course it

4191.44 --> 4195.96
typically comes in the winter time

4214.64 --> 4217.64
foreign

4222.239 --> 4225.239
so

4232.8 --> 4235.12
hmm

4242.96 --> 4247.12
right random explorer yeah you got to be

4244.719 --> 4247.12
careful

4249.92 --> 4255.679
are all of us affected by these winds

4253.76 --> 4258.08
yeah

4255.679 --> 4259.28
effectively everybody

4258.08 --> 4261.5199999999995
but

4259.28 --> 4262.8
not everybody gets hit as strong it all

4261.52 --> 4265.679
depends on

4262.8 --> 4269.360000000001
what you are like

4265.679 --> 4271.28
and more sensitive people get to

4269.36 --> 4274.5599999999995
typically get

4271.28 --> 4274.5599999999995
affected by it more

4275.84 --> 4281.679
which would for example typically lead

4279.92 --> 4286.4400000000005
manic depression

4281.679 --> 4286.4400000000005
type of situations for example

4287.12 --> 4289.36
or

4295.76 --> 4301.1990000000005
higher chances of

4298.56 --> 4303.4400000000005
nervous breakdowns

4301.199 --> 4306.32
because there's more tension

4303.44 --> 4306.32
in the spirit

4312.239 --> 4317.199
like i think that even basically nature

4314.96 --> 4319.28
gets affected by it

4317.199 --> 4322.639999999999
i think it might even be a direct

4319.28 --> 4324.5599999999995
reflection from nature like the what the

4322.64 --> 4328.159000000001
spirit of everything else out there is

4324.56 --> 4330.0
doing that it is that the collection of

4328.159 --> 4332.32
it all that does it

4330.0 --> 4334.08
because in this time of year yeah

4332.32 --> 4337.44
wild animals

4334.08 --> 4338.64
hunting type animals they get

4337.44 --> 4340.0
more

4338.64 --> 4342.320000000001
vicious

4340.0 --> 4346.719
typically

4342.32 --> 4346.719
they get more hunt hunt alike

4346.96 --> 4352.4
right so they basically know something

4349.44 --> 4353.599999999999
to do with the energy i got energies in

4352.4 --> 4357.839999999999
me

4353.6 --> 4357.84
that i don't know what to do with them

4357.92 --> 4362.32
so they end up kinda just burdening me

4368.88 --> 4372.400000000001
no it's not a synonym for depression

4371.36 --> 4375.4
then

4372.4 --> 4375.4
dick

4387.04 --> 4391.92
but you could get a depression from it

4389.76 --> 4394.159000000001
if you're not careful that it doesn't

4391.92 --> 4397.28
automatically happen the depression is

4394.159 --> 4399.92
the side effect right

4397.28 --> 4402.4
there's nothing measurable about it

4399.92 --> 4406.4800000000005
it's a non-palpable

4402.4 --> 4408.5599999999995
non-physics thing the ancestral winds

4406.48 --> 4411.36
not a physical thing not something you

4408.56 --> 4414.719
could ever tie into anything you learn

4411.36 --> 4416.88
about okay nothing

4414.719 --> 4418.32
there might be some fake descriptions

4416.88 --> 4420.88
here and there

4418.32 --> 4423.599999999999
maybe even in legends

4420.88 --> 4426.2390000000005
or in like ancient pagan traditions or

4423.6 --> 4428.2390000000005
something they might make mention of it

4426.239 --> 4431.919999999999
something like that

4428.239 --> 4434.639999999999
i didn't pluck it from anything specific

4431.92 --> 4437.4400000000005
in some book or something or some legacy

4434.64 --> 4440.56
i basically made it up the word for it

4437.44 --> 4444.08
but what i do is describe an effect that

4440.56 --> 4444.080000000001
i know is happening

4445.28 --> 4448.5599999999995
it's happening out there every time it

4447.6 --> 4450.719
happens

4448.56 --> 4453.360000000001
everybody changes because of it it's

4450.719 --> 4455.12
just that because we change

4453.36 --> 4457.599999999999
we don't notice it

4455.12 --> 4460.0
because we're changing from it

4457.6 --> 4461.52
most people don't notice that they just

4460.0 --> 4463.6
change and now they're like this and

4461.52 --> 4467.52
they don't understand and

4463.6 --> 4469.360000000001
just adapt and then it move on right

4467.52 --> 4471.360000000001
don't think about it just happens every

4469.36 --> 4472.88
time right if it just happens why would

4471.36 --> 4474.88
you think about it there's nothing you

4472.88 --> 4479.8
could do to really stop it

4474.88 --> 4479.8
but you can anticipate it

4491.52 --> 4497.0
ah okay aries 106. yeah good luck with

4494.0 --> 4497.0
that

4500.48 --> 4505.36
oh yeah for me new year's resolution is

4502.88 --> 4505.36
to kind of

4505.92 --> 4509.679
build

4507.52 --> 4512.080000000001
build my condition back

4509.679 --> 4514.0
like i don't want to i want don't want

4512.08 --> 4518.48
to permanently start feeling like some

4514.0 --> 4521.52
old cry cranky man or something

4518.48 --> 4524.5199999999995
i still have vitality i still have my

4521.52 --> 4524.52
flexibility

4524.88 --> 4530.4800000000005
i need to get moving a bit so yeah in a

4527.12 --> 4533.199
way i am looking forward to springtime

4530.48 --> 4536.159
i very much am

4533.199 --> 4538.32
i think i'll be able to use

4536.159 --> 4541.32
that a lot better this time this year

4538.32 --> 4541.32
around

4567.12 --> 4572.5599999999995
okay aries 106. well if you want some

4570.4 --> 4574.719
real serious

4572.56 --> 4577.1990000000005
advice on that maybe you should ask

4574.719 --> 4578.719
rasta hat i mean he's

4577.199 --> 4582.5599999999995
literally

4578.719 --> 4582.56
trained for that professionally

4583.6 --> 4587.1990000000005
like

4585.679 --> 4589.84
muscle building

4587.199 --> 4589.839999999999
dieting

4591.12 --> 4595.28
he knows

4592.48 --> 4596.639999999999
more than i do about it

4595.28 --> 4600.5199999999995
you might want to

4596.64 --> 4600.52
ask him for some advice

4608.159 --> 4614.239
right whether it is to gain weight or to

4610.64 --> 4617.04
lose weight he will know

4614.239 --> 4619.36
much better than the average typical

4617.04 --> 4622.5199999999995
person or even doctor on how to deal

4619.36 --> 4622.5199999999995
with that

4625.76 --> 4629.6
so yeah if you bump into him ask him

4635.52 --> 4638.159000000001
right

4636.48 --> 4642.4
because you might actually have to for

4638.159 --> 4642.4
example take certain things

4643.12 --> 4648.4
because you don't always get well

4645.76 --> 4650.56
chubby fat whatever you don't always get

4648.4 --> 4652.5599999999995
it from just eating food

4650.56 --> 4655.1990000000005
sometimes it's actually that you're

4652.56 --> 4658.080000000001
missing something so you got all these

4655.199 --> 4661.599999999999
spare substances

4658.08 --> 4663.92
that aren't ready for the next step

4661.6 --> 4666.400000000001
right they could have been used but it's

4663.92 --> 4669.36
not getting there because there's a

4666.4 --> 4669.36
switch missing

4670.48 --> 4674.718999999999
like yeah it can be all kind of

4672.8 --> 4676.320000000001
complicated like that

4674.719 --> 4679.199
so that's what it got why you got to

4676.32 --> 4680.88
look very carefully

4679.199 --> 4683.759999999999
into what you're eating what you're

4680.88 --> 4686.76
doing and what your body is doing

4683.76 --> 4686.76
anyway

4696.08 --> 4702.0
yeah and don't listen to any globers

4700.0 --> 4704.08
about that

4702.0 --> 4707.4
everybody blabbers on things they know

4704.08 --> 4707.4

4823.28 --> 4827.759999999999
fireworks in somebody's garden

4825.92 --> 4828.8
that's

4827.76 --> 4832.08
yeah

4828.8 --> 4834.0
that requires you to get a pretty severe

4832.08 --> 4837.679
bash in the face i don't care what your

4834.0 --> 4837.679
age is you don't [ __ ] do that

4890.08 --> 4892.8

4910.88 --> 4914.8
anti-social and everybody hates them

4913.199 --> 4917.839999999999
those are the only types of people that

4914.8 --> 4917.84

anyway so

5283.92 --> 5286.4800000000005
i think

5287.84 --> 5291.4400000000005

10 minutes ago yeah that it but that is

5311.76 --> 5316.88
like really really late geoshifter

5314.56 --> 5319.1990000000005

5316.88 --> 5319.1990000000005

5341.04 --> 5347.44
glad you guys are appreciate

5343.04 --> 5347.44
appreciative of it even though i'm not

5349.04 --> 5354.8
super fluid or anything

5352.08 --> 5354.8
you're sorry

5357.28 --> 5362.5599999999995
well maybe you can make up for it by uh

5360.48 --> 5365.5599999999995
by becoming a member of my channel

5362.56 --> 5365.56
geoshifter

5366.719 --> 5372.08
never be late again okay

5370.4 --> 5374.0
so does that mean that you're just

5372.08 --> 5377.0
either going to be on time or not show

5374.0 --> 5377.0
up

5379.04 --> 5382.96
no it's fine

5381.36 --> 5386.199
how are you doing by the way you sound

5382.96 --> 5386.199
very enthusiastic

5412.56 --> 5416.400000000001
same same for me well me

5417.76 --> 5422.2390000000005
i'm more like hanging in there kind of

5419.92 --> 5422.2390000000005
state

5425.36 --> 5428.5599999999995
i mean i have really good moments here

5427.199 --> 5430.48
and there

5428.56 --> 5432.88
but then it's kind of followed up by

5430.48 --> 5435.5199999999995
just like being

5432.88 --> 5438.4800000000005
overly stressed or

5435.52 --> 5441.120000000001
like unable to control the functions of

5438.48 --> 5441.12
my brain

5441.6 --> 5446.159000000001
like not being able to let go of fractal

5444.0 --> 5449.84
thinking which is quite punishing when

5446.159 --> 5449.839999999999
you actually want to let go of that

5452.48 --> 5457.28
all right but this is all typical you

5454.239 --> 5460.48
know i i recognize this is winter this

5457.28 --> 5463.12
is the winter state i i typically have

5460.48 --> 5465.599999999999
this every year

5463.12 --> 5469.04
and it expresses in some way

5465.6 --> 5470.8
usually in more radical moves more burst

5469.04 --> 5473.44
outs and [ __ ]

5470.8 --> 5475.6
but it's always been kind of

5473.44 --> 5477.28
rough

5475.6 --> 5478.8
and then afterward i don't really know

5477.28 --> 5481.12
what to think about or do about it or

5478.8 --> 5483.28
even size it up

5481.12 --> 5486.08
i'm trying to get it a bit more under

5483.28 --> 5486.08
control now

5486.639 --> 5493.04
but it's also heavier this year

5490.96 --> 5495.84
and i called that i called

5493.04 --> 5498.0
i announced it like the ancestral winds

5495.84 --> 5499.76
are coming it's going to be really heavy

5498.0 --> 5502.0
this year

5499.76 --> 5504.8
not just for me

5502.0 --> 5507.04
because there is like energy in the air

5504.8 --> 5508.2390000000005
of a certain type

5507.04 --> 5510.639
that is

5508.239 --> 5513.04
well the collective energy of everybody

5510.639 --> 5517.04
everybody and everything and and their

5513.04 --> 5520.0
consciousness and where they are going

5517.04 --> 5523.04
based on the structure

5520.0 --> 5525.04
yeah the spirit staircase that's natural

5523.04 --> 5526.4
everybody has like all that

5525.04 --> 5528.08
combined

5526.4 --> 5529.199
and this year is heavy

5528.08 --> 5531.5199999999995
there's

5529.199 --> 5536.32
basically fuel for

5531.52 --> 5536.320000000001
well a serious rebellion worldwide

5536.56 --> 5541.4400000000005
that's not found its place yet but it is

5539.52 --> 5545.080000000001
there it it it is

5541.44 --> 5545.08
starting to kindle

5546.32 --> 5550.799999999999
and yeah the overall burden of just

5551.36 --> 5556.239
psychological warfare the normalization

5554.239 --> 5560.4
of double speak

5556.239 --> 5561.919999999999
even in mainstream sources and all that

5560.4 --> 5564.4
that is all very punishing

5561.92 --> 5566.639
psychologically and now because it is

5564.4 --> 5567.839999999999
winter

5566.639 --> 5570.400000000001
the

5567.84 --> 5574.4800000000005
lash the backlash of all that the

5570.4 --> 5575.759999999999
feedback from all that is now

5574.48 --> 5577.599999999999
crunching it

5575.76 --> 5580.2390000000005
in everybody

5577.6 --> 5582.159000000001
including me and i can feel it even from

5580.239 --> 5584.32
others and that's the ancestral winds

5582.159 --> 5588.759999999999
it's just the literal punishment from

5584.32 --> 5588.759999999999
what it is to be a freaking human

5588.8 --> 5593.04
and actually taking that responsibility

5591.12 --> 5594.639
right taking responsibility taking

5593.04 --> 5597.44
punishment

5594.639 --> 5600.08
and you will get rewards for it but you

5597.44 --> 5601.678999999999
will damn well take the punishment

5600.08 --> 5605.12
and if you don't

5601.679 --> 5605.12
you got an even worse problem

5606.719 --> 5609.719
anyway

5617.92 --> 5621.76
try to do something mundane like a

5619.6 --> 5622.8
thousand puzzle pieces

5621.76 --> 5625.1990000000005
well

5622.8 --> 5628.0
well what i do for that lhg is play

5625.199 --> 5628.0
computer game

5629.679 --> 5634.8
that's my way of

5631.52 --> 5638.080000000001
making a puzzle like that

5634.8 --> 5638.08
i play computer games

5640.719 --> 5645.4800000000005
and so it's very important it has good

5642.48 --> 5645.48
music

5670.56 --> 5675.92
you can't do monday and stuff

5673.6 --> 5677.4400000000005
that's tough well as long as you have

5675.92 --> 5680.32
things to do

5677.44 --> 5680.32
then that's fine

5681.199 --> 5684.36
you know

5691.76 --> 5699.2390000000005
my daily life isn't exactly filled out

5694.639 --> 5699.2390000000005
in detail with a lot of procedures

5703.36 --> 5708.799999999999
i've internal procedures and just

5705.84 --> 5712.52
refinement of my show and

5708.8 --> 5712.52
but other than that

5714.719 --> 5719.6
it's overall pretty still

5716.8 --> 5720.8
because every time i engage in something

5719.6 --> 5723.280000000001
it

5720.8 --> 5725.6
is very unnerving to me every single

5723.28 --> 5728.599999999999
time it's only gotten worse as i got

5725.6 --> 5728.6
older

5733.92 --> 5736.92
no

5742.48 --> 5746.638999999999
i always have to be researching

5743.84 --> 5749.119000000001
discovering spreading awareness okay

5746.639 --> 5750.8
well hey if that works for you

5749.119 --> 5752.799999999999
you got to realize that a whole bunch of

5750.8 --> 5756.1990000000005
people out there are not always in the

5752.8 --> 5756.1990000000005
mood for that

5757.04 --> 5761.92
they'll just tune out they'll just like

5759.199 --> 5764.159
okay fine you do that i don't care but

5761.92 --> 5767.8
you do that

5764.159 --> 5767.799999999999
they'll be like that

5778.48 --> 5782.08
yeah chopping wood has taught me the

5780.56 --> 5783.76
power of the money yeah but that was

5782.08 --> 5785.5199999999995
brilliant dude

5783.76 --> 5787.84
that's a really good move

5785.52 --> 5788.8
like in a way leg i'm almost kind of

5787.84 --> 5790.4800000000005
jealous

5788.8 --> 5791.84
of your setup

5790.48 --> 5794.08
because it must be

5791.84 --> 5794.08
well

5794.56 --> 5802.119000000001
giving a lot of

5796.84 --> 5802.119000000001
focus to be doing that all the time

5819.36 --> 5822.36
so

5823.57 --> 5826.7699999999995
[Music]

5857.04 --> 5860.04
hmm

5869.199 --> 5873.5599999999995
that's right woodworking gunny bear

5883.04 --> 5886.4
yeah

5884.0 --> 5889.679
well i would like to have like a good

5886.4 --> 5889.679
bonfire myself

5895.52 --> 5901.119000000001
i'm pretty good with fire but yeah

5899.04 --> 5902.8
it's kind of weird to be like oh yeah

5901.119 --> 5905.44
i'm having a fire

5902.8 --> 5906.320000000001
all by myself alone

5905.44 --> 5909.719
yeah

5906.32 --> 5909.719
that's weird

5911.76 --> 5914.76
hmm

5918.27 --> 5921.389
[Music]

5925.44 --> 5927.678999999999
hmm

5927.92 --> 5932.56
i think the last bonfire even been

5930.48 --> 5935.28
present at

5932.56 --> 5938.719
was the 2019

5935.28 --> 5939.679
amsterdam flat earth conference

5938.719 --> 5942.719
like the

5939.679 --> 5942.719
big fire thing

5943.04 --> 5947.679
at the

5945.28 --> 5949.84
at uh yeah what the main house at the

5947.679 --> 5952.8
camping

5949.84 --> 5956.8
that one that's like the last fire

5952.8 --> 5956.8
true like fight real fire i've seen

5958.32 --> 5963.48
man

5959.199 --> 5963.48
it's almost three years ago now

5970.48 --> 5974.28
oh wait to the 1920

5975.28 --> 5978.84
two years ago

5987.44 --> 5990.44
so

6006.159 --> 6011.199
okay yeah you're just being gross bad

6008.719 --> 6011.199
karma

6011.6 --> 6015.84
does amsterdam has a yearly no they

6014.0 --> 6018.0
don't

6015.84 --> 6021.8
there's only been one as far as i know

6018.0 --> 6021.8
and that was that one

6027.84 --> 6031.92
i mean there might be like

6030.719 --> 6036.56
uh

6031.92 --> 6038.2390000000005
meetings like meetups for effie around

6036.56 --> 6039.1990000000005
because i'm pretty sure there are fe

6038.239 --> 6041.678999999999
people

6039.199 --> 6044.5599999999995
in the netherlands plenty

6041.679 --> 6047.56
but i'm not really aware of them too

6044.56 --> 6047.56
much

6076.8 --> 6080.56
hmm all right a random explorer sounds

6078.8 --> 6081.360000000001
great but

6080.56 --> 6083.280000000001
yeah

6081.36 --> 6085.36
my issue is i don't really have a garden

6083.28 --> 6087.44
to put that fire in

6085.36 --> 6088.32
if i had any kind of garden i'd probably

6087.44 --> 6092.119
put

6088.32 --> 6092.119
fireplace in there

6104.32 --> 6108.4
kind of want to make a fire now all

6105.84 --> 6108.400000000001

6448.56 --> 6453.04

6463.52 --> 6467.6
is very typically like that just like

6465.679 --> 6470.4800000000005
immediately like

6467.6 --> 6472.719
full-blown info bomb

6470.48 --> 6475.599999999999
every time just like [ __ ] you i'm just

6498.159 --> 6503.199
earther oh well that's cool nobody knows

6501.44 --> 6504.32

6503.199 --> 6506.48
so

6504.32 --> 6509.92
i've never met anybody that bumped to me

6506.48 --> 6513.759999999999
on this treated like hey is that arwen

6509.92 --> 6515.92
except for i kill the hope his wife

6515.92 --> 6518.92
happened

6536.32 --> 6541.119
what

6537.28 --> 6543.44
you're joking right ralph rodriguez

6541.119 --> 6543.44
what

6545.52 --> 6549.6
serious you're joking right

6552.84 --> 6556.2390000000005
really what

6565.36 --> 6569.159
i gotta see that

6574.48 --> 6579.199
that's hilarious no i'm definitely not

6576.8 --> 6579.1990000000005
in there

6581.199 --> 6588.719
oh from a news article oh well that

6584.56 --> 6591.04
immediately reveals no this is

6588.719 --> 6594.44
it's a very funny joke there

6591.04 --> 6594.44
ralph rodriguez

6621.64 --> 6624.85
[Music]

6663.44 --> 6667.759999999999
you can confirm never seen a dutch video

6665.36 --> 6671.199
being serious about fe yeah

6667.76 --> 6671.1990000000005
that's correct yo shifter

6672.239 --> 6677.839999999999
no it's like the netherlands is a glober

6676.0 --> 6681.119
like the collective spirit of the

6677.84 --> 6682.719
netherlands is a glober

6681.119 --> 6684.48
it is

6682.719 --> 6686.32
wouldn't you agree

6684.48 --> 6689.04
like it is that

6686.32 --> 6691.599
it's everything everybody taps into here

6689.04 --> 6693.76
it's a glober

6691.599 --> 6694.639
that collective spirit that everybody

6693.76 --> 6697.119000000001
gets

6694.639 --> 6700.639
is a glober

6697.119 --> 6703.5199999999995
like even if you know the earth is flat

6700.639 --> 6705.52
it's not compatible

6703.52 --> 6708.320000000001
this is what i've noticed like it's just

6705.52 --> 6712.56
not compatible well guess what turns out

6708.32 --> 6712.5599999999995
i'm not compatible with that

6713.599 --> 6718.8
like at all anymore

6716.4 --> 6721.92
like the entire mindset i'm not

6718.8 --> 6722.8
compatible i don't feel dutch anymore

6721.92 --> 6725.76
like

6722.8 --> 6728.639
really don't feel dutch

6725.76 --> 6731.280000000001
i have memories of what it i thought

6728.639 --> 6734.159000000001
dutch used to be

6731.28 --> 6737.159
and now it's all replaced with just this

6734.159 --> 6737.159
neo-grablerite

6738.4 --> 6744.239
go along to get along

6740.4 --> 6749.0
emotionally desensitized morally

6744.239 --> 6749.0
depraved mindset thing

6753.84 --> 6759.119000000001
modernism

6755.28 --> 6759.119
modern gravel mindset

6759.44 --> 6762.719
ugh

6761.28 --> 6766.48
are there any flat earth countries yeah

6762.719 --> 6766.4800000000005
all countries are flat earth countries

6767.36 --> 6774.5599999999995
they're all flat all countries are flat

6771.76 --> 6776.639
well the people in them might not

6774.56 --> 6780.639
know that

6776.639 --> 6780.639
but the countries in themselves are flat

6789.599 --> 6793.52
i did cover two people in my family sort

6791.84 --> 6795.360000000001
of oh that's cool

6793.52 --> 6796.639
oh that's that is kind of the most

6795.36 --> 6798.4
important part

6796.639 --> 6800.4800000000005
that you get connection with your family

6798.4 --> 6802.719
right well i was lucky enough to be able

6800.48 --> 6805.199
to connect the flat earth

6802.719 --> 6807.199
with my dad at least very was very quick

6805.199 --> 6808.719
with it

6807.199 --> 6811.36
like

6808.719 --> 6813.52
he actually knows certain arguments like

6811.36 --> 6815.5199999999995
he cares to know them

6813.52 --> 6818.0
that which is like

6815.52 --> 6818.84
almost jaw-dropping to me to actually

6818.0 --> 6822.639
find

6818.84 --> 6825.28
somebody that is like really wants to

6822.639 --> 6826.88
know the details that's like a miracle

6825.28 --> 6828.32
to me

6826.88 --> 6830.400000000001
right

6828.32 --> 6832.159
outside of people

6830.4 --> 6833.92
i deal with like the flat earth debates

6832.159 --> 6836.0
right in the netherlands finding

6833.92 --> 6839.84
somebody that actually wants to know the

6836.0 --> 6839.84
details that's a miracle

6840.48 --> 6845.36
because everybody's just fine blabbering

6842.719 --> 6849.119
around just blah blah blah blabber

6845.36 --> 6852.239
nobody researches nobody cares really

6849.119 --> 6852.239
just talking points

6855.44 --> 6859.759999999999
but yeah my dad

6856.96 --> 6862.96
has figured it out also my stepmother is

6859.76 --> 6865.119000000001
closer like she is now on a fence

6862.96 --> 6866.2390000000005
situation she's always been very spirit

6865.119 --> 6868.88
focused

6866.239 --> 6872.32
but she is realizing that

6868.88 --> 6872.32
that the globe is a lie

6874.08 --> 6877.84
she's figuring that out

6879.599 --> 6883.92
and i think she's just

6881.119 --> 6887.119
slowly trying to transit which is

6883.92 --> 6888.2390000000005
extremely tough because she is right in

6887.119 --> 6892.0
the middle

6888.239 --> 6894.159
of that dutch globe mindset that's her

6892.0 --> 6896.08
thing that's how she that's where her

6894.159 --> 6898.799999999999
expertise comes in and how to deal with

6896.08 --> 6901.44
that so it's kind of tough on her

6898.8 --> 6905.1990000000005
but she's not gonna push she never

6901.44 --> 6906.96
pushes any idea on anybody ever

6905.199 --> 6909.44
like ever

6906.96 --> 6911.36
and she knows quite a few things

6909.44 --> 6913.199
she never pushes anything

6911.36 --> 6914.719
she's not gonna push flat earth but at

6913.199 --> 6916.879999999999
least she's now

6914.719 --> 6919.119
in contrast to say like two or three

6916.88 --> 6920.32
years ago when she was like

6919.119 --> 6922.799999999999
whatever

6920.32 --> 6925.119
don't really understand now she's like

6922.8 --> 6925.119000000001
huh

6926.48 --> 6929.839999999999
there's really something to this isn't

6928.08 --> 6934.92
it

6929.84 --> 6934.92
so that's progress i guess

6959.119 --> 6964.239
everybody will find out eventually yeah

6961.679 --> 6964.2390000000005
probably

6965.119 --> 6969.679
doesn't mean it's going to change

6966.4 --> 6971.598999999999
anything though woodworking anywhere

6969.679 --> 6975.04
i predict that there will be no

6971.599 --> 6976.8
transition there will be no switch

6975.04 --> 6979.5199999999995
the narrative

6976.8 --> 6982.08
is very deep

6979.52 --> 6987.599
and part of the game is to never admit

6982.08 --> 6989.76
defeat so even if everybody in the world

6987.599 --> 6991.28
would know it's not a ball and like

6989.76 --> 6994.4800000000005
really know

6991.28 --> 6996.0
every detail as to why black swan text

6994.48 --> 6997.04
and

6996.0 --> 6999.679
sun

6997.04 --> 7001.119
all the graphics everything everything

6999.679 --> 7002.56
it

7001.119 --> 7005.5199999999995
still wouldn't stop

7002.56 --> 7008.159000000001
that still just put it up as an art

7005.52 --> 7011.76
piece as in this is

7008.159 --> 7014.08
how we are acting like it is

7011.76 --> 7016.639
they're not gonna stop i don't think

7014.08 --> 7019.5199999999995
they can stop i don't think they are

7016.639 --> 7021.599
able to stop it

7019.52 --> 7023.280000000001
i don't think

7021.599 --> 7025.1990000000005
there might be a thing

7023.28 --> 7028.0
i don't know if it's real

7025.199 --> 7029.119
that media can't even cohesively

7028.0 --> 7030.719
function

7029.119 --> 7036.5599999999995
without the

7030.719 --> 7036.56
globe religion as a universal backdrop

7036.719 --> 7044.32
ever considered this can

7040.56 --> 7047.280000000001
media like in general media can it even

7044.32 --> 7048.719
truly function properly

7047.28 --> 7051.36
without

7048.719 --> 7054.4
the globe religion

7051.36 --> 7056.639
as a unifying factor backdrop as a

7054.4 --> 7059.119
standard assumption backdrop thing to

7056.639 --> 7062.08
fall back on for all media

7059.119 --> 7065.5199999999995
to attune their frequencies to adapt

7062.08 --> 7068.159
can it even exist

7065.52 --> 7071.679
and persist and thrive

7068.159 --> 7073.28
can is that even possible

7071.679 --> 7075.52
that's something that i've been thinking

7073.28 --> 7075.5199999999995
about

7075.599 --> 7079.84
my fractal thinking dwellings and all

7077.92 --> 7081.4400000000005
that

7079.84 --> 7083.360000000001
i don't think

7081.44 --> 7085.04
it's ever going to be

7083.36 --> 7087.679
like officially recognized like

7085.04 --> 7088.96
everybody can learn and like really

7087.679 --> 7090.4
learn

7088.96 --> 7092.719
but i don't think they're ever going to

7090.4 --> 7095.5199999999995
stop i don't think they can stop i don't

7092.719 --> 7098.159
think they're even legally allowed to

7095.52 --> 7100.88
stop doing that

7098.159 --> 7103.28
they might all be contracted in

7100.88 --> 7104.8
through like several generational

7103.28 --> 7109.4
contracts

7104.8 --> 7109.400000000001
it's like something that just can't stop

7120.8 --> 7124.639
right so just imagine like oh

7122.56 --> 7126.4800000000005
everybody's figuring it out every you

7124.639 --> 7128.639
can literally go to a person on the

7126.48 --> 7130.32
street and say like

7128.639 --> 7133.92
ah

7130.32 --> 7136.5599999999995
any proof of the geometric horizon

7133.92 --> 7139.119
and they all say like haha come on we

7136.56 --> 7140.2390000000005
know it's optical it's not the edge of a

7139.119 --> 7142.48
curve

7140.239 --> 7144.959999999999
of a ball

7142.48 --> 7147.759999999999
and you would still

7144.96 --> 7150.56
see the ball on the news

7147.76 --> 7151.360000000001
even though everybody you'd ask would

7150.56 --> 7153.599
know

7151.36 --> 7156.08
it's not a ball that they're standing on

7153.599 --> 7157.76
that they're living in

7156.08 --> 7160.8
that still go

7157.76 --> 7162.96
that's my prediction

7160.8 --> 7165.4400000000005
ever thought about have you even

7162.96 --> 7168.719
thought about that

7165.44 --> 7171.5199999999995
have you just been staring blind at oh

7168.719 --> 7174.2390000000005
the end of the struggle oh finally one

7171.52 --> 7176.320000000001
day flat earth will finally be realized

7174.239 --> 7178.48
and it'll all be over

7176.32 --> 7180.96
yeah no

7178.48 --> 7181.879999999999
that's always an illusion

7180.96 --> 7184.56
like

7181.88 --> 7186.639
universally that type of thinking

7184.56 --> 7188.88
universally not even flat earth

7186.639 --> 7191.52
everything everything that type of

7188.88 --> 7194.08
thinking oh we're gonna keep on going

7191.52 --> 7195.599
and then one day it'll be over is

7194.08 --> 7196.84
always

7195.599 --> 7200.88
wrong

7196.84 --> 7203.92
always always always always always

7200.88 --> 7205.679
throughout human history always wrong it

7203.92 --> 7208.08
never works like that

7205.679 --> 7209.76
it's the dream

7208.08 --> 7211.84
inside your head

7209.76 --> 7215.119000000001
that makes you think that that is

7211.84 --> 7219.08
logical conclusion it never

7215.119 --> 7219.08
ever is

7226.159 --> 7228.48
ah

7233.92 --> 7237.8
it doesn't go away

7255.199 --> 7258.32
right the only way you could go make it

7257.199 --> 7260.239
go away

7258.32 --> 7262.639
is through the darkness it's through

7260.239 --> 7264.799999999999
absolute evil and the sacrifice of

7262.639 --> 7266.32
everything that matters

7264.8 --> 7268.400000000001
and then you can be just like the

7266.32 --> 7270.48
communist and just say oh we're gonna

7268.4 --> 7272.799999999999
bully the globers away we're all gonna

7270.48 --> 7274.32
make their life so [ __ ] miserable for

7272.8 --> 7276.0
their globe belief

7274.32 --> 7277.599
that they're literally gonna kill

7276.0 --> 7280.08
themselves

7277.599 --> 7282.639
so that there will be nobody left to

7280.08 --> 7284.4
uphold it whatever motivates them to do

7282.639 --> 7287.04
so yeah

7284.4 --> 7288.96
well guess what that doesn't even work

7287.04 --> 7290.32
because the communists out there right

7288.96 --> 7292.2390000000005
now in the world they're trying that

7290.32 --> 7294.639
with all kinds of groups

7292.239 --> 7296.32
and it's not working on that either yeah

7294.639 --> 7298.08
everybody's getting miserable and yeah

7296.32 --> 7300.88
some people might be killing themselves

7298.08 --> 7302.639
over that [ __ ]

7300.88 --> 7305.119
and others are

7302.639 --> 7307.119
actually recognizing it for what it is

7305.119 --> 7309.759999999999
and having the logical

7307.119 --> 7312.48
godly driven response to it

7309.76 --> 7314.719
and they're crushing it more

7312.48 --> 7316.799999999999
than before

7314.719 --> 7318.719
and the same will happen with the globe

7316.8 --> 7319.679
religion

7318.719 --> 7321.52
it will

7319.679 --> 7325.599
never

7321.52 --> 7328.4800000000005
ever go away you understand

7325.599 --> 7331.04
this is a taint

7328.48 --> 7333.36
a spell you could say or a puzzle a

7331.04 --> 7336.0
paradigm puzzle

7333.36 --> 7338.5599999999995
designated for humanity

7336.0 --> 7341.28
once it got here i don't think it's ever

7338.56 --> 7344.719
gonna go away it's always gonna exist in

7341.28 --> 7346.719
some form even just as a game to me it's

7344.719 --> 7350.0
a game

7346.719 --> 7352.719
literally i see the globe cosmology it's

7350.0 --> 7354.96
a game it's a game i love i love to play

7352.719 --> 7357.92
that game i'm very good at it i take it

7354.96 --> 7360.8
very serious i take pride in being good

7357.92 --> 7360.8
and playing the game

7360.88 --> 7364.32
why

7362.48 --> 7366.959999999999
because i know

7364.32 --> 7368.88
that's the only way i will be able to

7366.96 --> 7371.679
deal with it without losing my mind

7368.88 --> 7375.28
because if i actually think that that

7371.679 --> 7376.88
[ __ ] globe religion is going to go

7375.28 --> 7378.88
away forever

7376.88 --> 7383.76
well [ __ ] you

7378.88 --> 7386.88
it will never go away you understand

7383.76 --> 7388.280000000001
it will go away

7386.88 --> 7392.159000000001
as much as

7388.28 --> 7395.639
reproduction goes away it will never go

7392.159 --> 7395.638999999999
away you understand

7395.679 --> 7400.88
the only way to deal with it is to

7399.199 --> 7404.879999999999
take it

7400.88 --> 7407.679
master it and overcome the delusion that

7404.88 --> 7410.56
plagues everybody concerning it

7407.679 --> 7412.88
by seeing it as the game that it is and

7410.56 --> 7414.4800000000005
it probably originally was to the ones

7412.88 --> 7416.8
that actually

7414.48 --> 7418.799999999999
started building this thing

7416.8 --> 7421.8
and then take it back

7418.8 --> 7425.76
as our game

7421.8 --> 7427.4400000000005
humanities game that we play

7425.76 --> 7429.679
with our minds

7427.44 --> 7431.598999999999
creating virtual

7429.679 --> 7434.88
places

7431.599 --> 7437.92
and then differentiate it and know what

7434.88 --> 7440.32
is real and know what isn't and that's

7437.92 --> 7443.119
in the end the only thing that is truly

7440.32 --> 7446.079
important in the face of everything

7443.119 --> 7449.96
so that's what i've done

7446.079 --> 7449.96
it's never gonna go away

7452.0 --> 7455.279
[Music]

7458.2 --> 7462.16
[Music]

7469.119 --> 7474.639
right is it unexpected little bonus

7471.52 --> 7476.4800000000005
speech there from my side

7474.639 --> 7479.84
i was actually gonna round out the show

7476.48 --> 7479.839999999999
but yeah

7483.199 --> 7487.839999999999
just every time i see some flat earth ah

7485.44 --> 7490.48
it's gonna go away it's like no you

7487.84 --> 7492.8
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're just as dumb as

7490.48 --> 7495.839999999999
the anti-flat earthers it's never gonna

7492.8 --> 7498.96
go you think the anti-flat earthers

7495.84 --> 7502.159000000001
actually think yeah yeah yeah actually

7498.96 --> 7504.96
think flat earth is gonna go away yeah

7502.159 --> 7508.239
what makes you different what makes you

7504.96 --> 7510.0
different from an anti-flat earther

7508.239 --> 7512.718999999999
thinking

7510.0 --> 7514.719
that the other thing in your case of the

7512.719 --> 7517.44
flat earth or the globe that it's going

7514.719 --> 7519.36
to go away oh just because you found a

7517.44 --> 7521.44
logically consistent argument to

7519.36 --> 7523.36
completely disprove it oh that's gonna

7521.44 --> 7524.879999999999
make it go away

7523.36 --> 7527.44
no

7524.88 --> 7530.32
no it won't

7527.44 --> 7534.079
don't you get it

7530.32 --> 7537.28
it's never gonna go away

7534.079 --> 7539.599
you can't make it go away

7537.28 --> 7540.48
there's nothing you can do to make it go

7539.599 --> 7545.52
away

7540.48 --> 7545.5199999999995
what you can do however is master it

7545.92 --> 7550.4800000000005
keep

7546.84 --> 7553.4400000000005
it be honorable do the right thing

7550.48 --> 7556.159
follow god's laws all that

7553.44 --> 7560.239
and just be a keeper of it

7556.159 --> 7563.36
and know what is real and what is not

7560.239 --> 7564.879999999999
that's the only real thing you can do

7563.36 --> 7567.598999999999
with it

7564.88 --> 7569.1990000000005
to know what is real and what is not

7567.599 --> 7570.88
it's the only thing that's really

7569.199 --> 7574.32
important in the end because our

7570.88 --> 7577.76
imaginations are already

7574.32 --> 7578.96
very much explored in this realm very

7577.76 --> 7581.360000000001
much so

7578.96 --> 7582.56
through media through movies through

7581.36 --> 7584.239
games

7582.56 --> 7585.679
rm dude we

7584.239 --> 7588.4
live 90

7585.679 --> 7592.96
plus imagination everything that passes

7588.4 --> 7592.96
through our heads is 90 imagination

7593.52 --> 7598.639
and we probably don't even realize parts

7596.159 --> 7600.48
of that because we even there's parts of

7598.639 --> 7602.2390000000005
our imagination that we just take for

7600.48 --> 7604.718999999999
granted because we have no other

7602.239 --> 7607.36
recourse so we just accept it as ruby

7604.719 --> 7608.32
because we have no other recourse

7607.36 --> 7610.239
right

7608.32 --> 7612.639
so you might end up

7610.239 --> 7614.239
staring at it all from your vantage

7612.639 --> 7616.84
point mentally and just thinking like

7614.239 --> 7619.199
okay yeah well 60 of what i think is

7616.84 --> 7620.56
real and the rest is imagination i

7619.199 --> 7624.32
recognize that

7620.56 --> 7626.96
yeah well guess what no it's really 90.

7624.32 --> 7628.5599999999995
you just don't know

7626.96 --> 7631.52
that 40

7628.56 --> 7634.400000000001
you don't or that 30 you don't know what

7631.52 --> 7634.400000000001
that is yet

7635.28 --> 7640.079
i guarantee you

7636.96 --> 7643.079
ninety percent is imagination

7640.079 --> 7643.079
plus

7657.92 --> 7663.28
so yeah don't get too cocky what oh just

7660.8 --> 7666.079000000001
because you have completely mastered a

7663.28 --> 7669.599
technical argument to disprove something

7666.079 --> 7669.599
then that makes it go away

7669.92 --> 7674.4800000000005
if only the word would actually work

7672.079 --> 7678.679
like that wouldn't that be great

7674.48 --> 7678.678999999999
well guess what it doesn't

7691.36 --> 7695.44
four more hours

7692.96 --> 7697.679
i'm not going to hold out that long leg

7695.44 --> 7699.5199999999995
but i do feel a lot better though

7697.679 --> 7700.8
it's almost a waste

7699.52 --> 7703.8
i'm hungry i'm going to eat this cassava

7700.8 --> 7703.8
cassano

7723.679 --> 7728.4
what if they ship us off to an island

7725.84 --> 7731.599
and blow it up

7728.4 --> 7735.199
there's much easier ways to do that

7731.599 --> 7736.719
but they can't because

7735.199 --> 7739.199
just like

7736.719 --> 7740.96
[ __ ] up

7739.199 --> 7743.759999999999
satan worshippers

7740.96 --> 7747.52
always return

7743.76 --> 7749.92
roots so do flat earthers because

7747.52 --> 7751.84
there will just be people born

7749.92 --> 7753.599
that will just completely without

7751.84 --> 7756.8
sources

7753.599 --> 7759.28
figure it out they will follow

7756.8 --> 7761.52
the virtual not the virtual uh the

7759.28 --> 7763.759999999999
spiritual pathways

7761.52 --> 7766.0
that we have walked they will literally

7763.76 --> 7768.0
step in our echoes even though they've

7766.0 --> 7770.8
never known we existed

7768.0 --> 7774.159
that's what humans do

7770.8 --> 7774.96
you walk the same pathways spiritually

7774.159 --> 7778.0
as

7774.96 --> 7779.36
ancestors and all other people before

7778.0 --> 7781.44
you

7779.36 --> 7783.679
wherever they've walked

7781.44 --> 7784.839999999999
you will be able to walk

7783.679 --> 7788.32
and

7784.84 --> 7791.1990000000005
beyond even if you've never heard of

7788.32 --> 7793.679
flat earth there will be kids growing up

7791.199 --> 7795.5199999999995
mastering it figuring out how it's all

7793.679 --> 7797.92
being fooled and it will happen all over

7795.52 --> 7799.76
it they can't get rid of it so unless

7797.92 --> 7801.28
they're prepared

7799.76 --> 7804.0
to basically

7801.28 --> 7808.0
ritually slaughter whole categories of

7804.0 --> 7808.0
people every generation

7808.88 --> 7812.56
it's never gonna go away

7811.28 --> 7814.159
yeah

7812.56 --> 7816.2390000000005
because the only way you can keep it

7814.159 --> 7817.839999999999
away it's not about making it go it's

7816.239 --> 7820.239
about keeping it away and the only way

7817.84 --> 7823.52
to keep it away is through

7820.239 --> 7825.0
absolute atrocious unstable

7823.52 --> 7826.2390000000005
destabilizing

7825.0 --> 7829.28
[Music]

7826.239 --> 7833.28
more effective human sacrifice

7829.28 --> 7833.28
to literally kill the ones that do

7833.84 --> 7839.360000000001
and that's totally destabilizing you

7836.639 --> 7841.52
could never even uphold a proper dream

7839.36 --> 7842.88
anymore in such a scenario

7841.52 --> 7844.159000000001
everything would break that's why they

7842.88 --> 7845.92
can't do it

7844.159 --> 7847.199
because if they could have done it they

7845.92 --> 7848.8
would have

7847.199 --> 7852.0
doesn't work

7848.8 --> 7852.0
you can't get rid of it

7852.48 --> 7858.079
we can't get rid of the globe

7855.04 --> 7860.719
they can't get rid of flat earthers

7858.079 --> 7863.199
so both of us better just learn to

7860.719 --> 7864.96
freaking deal with it

7863.199 --> 7867.759999999999
yeah

7864.96 --> 7867.76
everybody can

7867.84 --> 7873.119000000001
be in the same realm

7870.88 --> 7873.84
and still manage to get around without

7873.119 --> 7877.5199999999995
just

7873.84 --> 7880.679
obsessing over killing others

7877.52 --> 7880.679
you know

7906.32 --> 7910.4
yeah but they can't make us believe

7910.719 --> 7913.84
like the ritual

7914.56 --> 7916.2390000000005
c

7915.44 --> 7919.28
v

7916.239 --> 7921.04
sacrifice world sacrifice eugenics based

7919.28 --> 7924.079
system

7921.04 --> 7925.76
it only works on volunteerism

7924.079 --> 7927.28
that's the whole point

7925.76 --> 7930.320000000001
you could never

7927.28 --> 7932.88
get a glober to voluntarily lay down the

7930.32 --> 7934.719
globe forever

7932.88 --> 7937.4400000000005
while they still believe it you can

7934.719 --> 7939.44
never make a flat earther

7937.44 --> 7941.839999999999
stop understanding how the earth is not

7939.44 --> 7941.839999999999
a globe

7942.4 --> 7945.92
you can only

7944.56 --> 7948.159000000001
make people

7945.92 --> 7951.04
really dumb and comfortable with being

7948.159 --> 7953.44
dumb and rewarding them for being dumb

7951.04 --> 7954.4
and them making them euthanize

7953.44 --> 7957.839999999999
themselves

7954.4 --> 7957.839999999999
and that's what they're doing right now

7959.599 --> 7963.76
and that doesn't work

7962.32 --> 7966.639
on

7963.76 --> 7968.56
people in ideological struggles

7966.639 --> 7970.32
or philosophical struggles like flat

7968.56 --> 7971.4400000000005
earthers and globers it doesn't work on

7970.32 --> 7975.5199999999995
that right

7971.44 --> 7975.5199999999995
it doesn't even work on the anti-vaxxers

7976.079 --> 7979.28
you could shame them you could target

7977.599 --> 7980.96
them you go oh we have to get them or we

7979.28 --> 7984.239
gotta get there with the military it

7980.96 --> 7985.199
doesn't work it doesn't work it doesn't

7984.239 --> 7987.678999999999
work

7985.199 --> 7989.04
anti-fractures are never gonna change

7987.679 --> 7992.4
their stance

7989.04 --> 7992.4
once they get to the point

7992.719 --> 7999.76
where they they get a grasp of the depth

7995.92 --> 8002.4800000000005
of the situation that's unfolding here

7999.76 --> 8005.360000000001
they will never switch they'd rather

8002.48 --> 8007.28
die a soldier's type of death or

8005.36 --> 8009.119
something i would

8007.28 --> 8011.5199999999995
i'm never getting faxed again i

8009.119 --> 8012.5599999999995
literally just freaking sniper me

8011.52 --> 8015.360000000001
serious

8012.56 --> 8017.92
whatever i don't care what torture me i

8015.36 --> 8018.96
don't care i will never surrender and i

8017.92 --> 8021.76
will

8018.96 --> 8024.4800000000005
damage other people at minimum

8021.76 --> 8028.639
take them out at best

8024.48 --> 8031.36
i will never surrender ever

8028.639 --> 8034.8
i'm very well prepared to face the

8031.36 --> 8034.799999999999
consequences for all of that

8035.04 --> 8038.8
because i don't want to even

8037.679 --> 8041.119
feel

8038.8 --> 8043.84
another option exists

8041.119 --> 8046.88
it doesn't exist for me anymore i will

8043.84 --> 8049.119000000001
never surrender no matter the cost even

8046.88 --> 8052.8
if it is the destruction of the entire

8049.119 --> 8056.0
world in itself i don't care anymore

8052.8 --> 8056.0
never yield ever

8056.26 --> 8059.359
[Music]

8059.679 --> 8064.88
no matter the cost never yield ever no

8062.4 --> 8068.638999999999
matter the cost never yield ever no

8064.88 --> 8072.4400000000005
matter the cost never yield ever no

8068.639 --> 8072.4400000000005
matter the cost

8088.8 --> 8092.88
do you have to get welfare well there's

8090.8 --> 8094.639
gonna be a whole bunch of people dying

8092.88 --> 8097.76
then

8094.639 --> 8097.76
it's unacceptable

8100.4 --> 8103.598999999999
if they do that it's gonna mean civil

8102.639 --> 8105.84
war

8103.599 --> 8109.360000000001
like it will be a civil war it's not

8105.84 --> 8113.119000000001
just oh organ no no people are going to

8109.36 --> 8117.36
literally burn down government buildings

8113.119 --> 8117.36
myself included if they go there

8120.079 --> 8122.799999999999
right

8121.599 --> 8126.599
very simple

8122.8 --> 8131.4400000000005
you kill the filthy [ __ ]

8126.599 --> 8132.88
eugenicist corporate banker relationship

8131.44 --> 8137.119
wielding

8132.88 --> 8140.8
politicians and you take their freaking

8137.119 --> 8140.799999999999
money you just take it

8142.639 --> 8148.079
go in their homes you kill them

8145.599 --> 8150.96
you put their freaking heads on the

8148.079 --> 8154.96
spikes of their own fences and then you

8150.96 --> 8158.0
loot their houses until nothing is left

8154.96 --> 8158.0
that's the response

8159.52 --> 8162.639
i'll bring the knife

8163.76 --> 8167.079000000001
no problem

8171.24 --> 8178.7789999999995
[Music]

8186.4 --> 8191.44
no it isn't hopeless

8189.28 --> 8192.719
it isn't hopeless nathan r

8191.44 --> 8194.399
we can

8192.719 --> 8196.399
kill them

8194.399 --> 8197.679
you understand

8196.399 --> 8201.08
we can

8197.679 --> 8201.08
kill them

8212.399 --> 8215.119999999999
and we will

8217.76 --> 8221.319
not flat earthers

8222.399 --> 8225.519
not people in chat

8225.84 --> 8228.479
everybody

8231.519 --> 8236.0
it's gonna go there

8233.679 --> 8237.92
they're running out of maneuvering room

8236.0 --> 8240.479
and if they keep

8237.92 --> 8240.479
reaching

8240.559 --> 8243.92
up there

8242.399 --> 8246.8
lowering the bar

8243.92 --> 8250.0
that will point will arrive

8246.8 --> 8252.16
it will make the french revolution

8250.0 --> 8254.96
look like it's yeah

8252.16 --> 8254.96
a school play

8255.679 --> 8260.719000000001
like these people that are doing this

8258.24 --> 8264.96
will be slaughtered

8260.719 --> 8268.08
in bloody fashion like you've never seen

8264.96 --> 8271.759999999998
except maybe in certain movies

8268.08 --> 8274.88
they will be slaughtered people

8271.76 --> 8278.800000000001
and some will be like tortured in ways

8274.88 --> 8278.8
that you never even thought is possible

8284.24 --> 8289.76
you know because they can't get away

8286.479 --> 8294.559
with it they're pushing like they can

8289.76 --> 8294.559000000001
and the price is their life

8302.479 --> 8306.559
yeah they should be slaughtered publicly

8304.479 --> 8309.358999999999
and they will because they are going

8306.559 --> 8312.719
they are they are not stopping

8309.359 --> 8312.719000000001
and so they will die

8313.04 --> 8317.28
yeah at some point the tension's gonna

8315.519 --> 8321.359
go up so high

8317.28 --> 8324.399000000001
people won't even give a [ __ ] about

8321.359 --> 8327.519
judges and courts and

8324.399 --> 8330.719
all that [ __ ] it's just gonna no we get

8327.519 --> 8333.84
him and then they die

8330.719 --> 8333.839999999998
and then it's over

8346.0 --> 8349.599
don't bring a knife to a gunfight

8350.559 --> 8354.96
well how about a thousand people with

8352.559 --> 8354.96
knives

8356.16 --> 8362.719
how about

8357.92 --> 8362.719000000001
having a big rock to the side of that

8364.08 --> 8368.639
how about freaking fireworks

8366.8 --> 8370.16
what if everybody just took one of those

8368.639 --> 8372.319
things

8370.16 --> 8374.639
light them up like 20 of them and just

8372.319 --> 8377.599
throw them at the guy

8374.639 --> 8379.358999999999
see what happens then

8377.599 --> 8381.84
stick went up his ass

8379.359 --> 8383.2
what dude this is all going a bit out of

8381.84 --> 8386.319
control here but

8383.2 --> 8390.960000000001
like no you can't stop it they cannot

8386.319 --> 8393.279999999999
stop it no robot titan army is gonna

8390.96 --> 8397.519999999999
prevent them from getting killed over

8393.28 --> 8400.84
this you understand nothing can prevent

8397.52 --> 8403.52
these [ __ ] up eugenics elite pieces of

8400.84 --> 8406.319
[ __ ] and all their minions

8403.52 --> 8408.960000000001
from getting killed over this there's

8406.319 --> 8411.96
nothing that is going to prevent that

8408.96 --> 8411.96
nothing

8419.479 --> 8422.72
999 with knives i will bring the fire

8421.84 --> 8425.72
again

8422.72 --> 8425.72
cool

8434.16 --> 8438.64
yeah but it's not just

8436.319 --> 8440.64
it's not even just like cloud schwab or

8438.64 --> 8441.519999999999
anything

8440.64 --> 8445.439
it's

8441.52 --> 8448.08
vast amounts of people that have all

8445.439 --> 8450.64
joined hands in this and they're all

8448.08 --> 8452.88
gonna die you see

8450.64 --> 8456.24
as i said it's gonna make the french

8452.88 --> 8457.759999999998
revolution look like a school play in

8456.24 --> 8460.479
comparison

8457.76 --> 8461.76
they're all going to die people all of

8460.479 --> 8463.438999999998
them

8461.76 --> 8466.479
no exception

8463.439 --> 8469.359
no escape they're all going to die and

8466.479 --> 8470.319
there's nothing they can do to stop it

8469.359 --> 8473.2
except

8470.319 --> 8475.119999999999
do it themselves get it over with

8473.2 --> 8478.800000000001
quickly

8475.12 --> 8480.479000000001
avoid the possibility of very painful

8478.8 --> 8482.72
prolonged torture

8480.479 --> 8486.279999999999
which some of them will be subjected to

8482.72 --> 8486.279999999999
for what they've done

8500.73 --> 8504.9
[Music]

8538.319 --> 8541.279999999999
yeah well woodworking gummy bear i know

8540.16 --> 8542.96
that

8541.28 --> 8545.359
at some point it's not gonna matter

8542.96 --> 8545.358999999999
anymore

8552.8 --> 8557.438999999998
when you know

8554.96 --> 8560.16
certain individuals

8557.439 --> 8562.479000000001
all combined have literally

8560.16 --> 8564.72
visibly memorably

8562.479 --> 8566.16
destroyed everything you've known and

8564.72 --> 8569.279999999999
cherished

8566.16 --> 8571.52
you won't give a [ __ ] for how hard it is

8569.28 --> 8573.76
to do all that you won't give a [ __ ]

8571.52 --> 8575.92
anymore and that will be

8573.76 --> 8578.72
not you as an individual

8575.92 --> 8583.16
that's gonna be the collective spirit

8578.72 --> 8583.16
yeah guess what's gonna happen

8584.0 --> 8588.8
when a collective spirit

8586.72 --> 8590.24
that kills like that

8588.8 --> 8592.399
doesn't have

8590.24 --> 8594.08
consciousness problems like an

8592.399 --> 8595.76
individual

8594.08 --> 8598.24
that might

8595.76 --> 8602.0
like get post-traumatic stress from a

8598.24 --> 8603.039999999999
war situation or a kill

8602.0 --> 8605.76
right

8603.04 --> 8608.960000000001
it doesn't work the same this is not a

8605.76 --> 8610.960000000001
soldier's consciousness issue this is a

8608.96 --> 8612.88
collective spirit

8610.96 --> 8615.919999999998
that's going to arrive

8612.88 --> 8618.16
and they're all going to die

8615.92 --> 8619.84
and there's nothing they can do prevent

8618.16 --> 8621.84
it

8619.84 --> 8623.6
it's the same spirit

8621.84 --> 8627.28
i shared with you

8623.6 --> 8630.0
in episode 82 that's what that is i

8627.28 --> 8633.28
called for it i knew i said if this is

8630.0 --> 8635.76
going to happen if this all this [ __ ]

8633.28 --> 8638.399000000001
it's not so that was before the corona

8635.76 --> 8641.84
[ __ ] yeah that was before

8638.399 --> 8641.84
before all of that

8644.24 --> 8648.0
it's coming

8646.24 --> 8652.039999999999
cannot be stopped

8648.0 --> 8652.04
they're all going to die

8654.399 --> 8658.399
i have a list of names no but i'm not

8656.24 --> 8661.6
going there because it's too

8658.399 --> 8663.92
i i don't need to i shouldn't need to

8661.6 --> 8666.800000000001
have that list

8663.92 --> 8668.64
not me as an individual

8666.8 --> 8672.399
i don't need

8668.64 --> 8672.399
everybody knows who they are

8672.56 --> 8676.479
roughly

8673.68 --> 8678.880000000001
knows the anchor points of the people

8676.479 --> 8680.16
that are doing this

8678.88 --> 8682.64
and then

8680.16 --> 8684.96
the others that are proficient at it can

8682.64 --> 8687.119999999999
simply trace them it can they can be

8684.96 --> 8690.24
traced who are they connected to

8687.12 --> 8690.240000000002
it can be figured out

8691.12 --> 8695.6
right all these cops

8693.6 --> 8697.84
that have been fired because they

8695.6 --> 8698.800000000001
refused to get the jab right

8697.84 --> 8701.84
well

8698.8 --> 8705.119999999999
they their skills will be very handy

8701.84 --> 8706.880000000001
they will be very handy in profiling and

8705.12 --> 8708.08
tracing

8706.88 --> 8709.839999999998
all these

8708.08 --> 8713.68
nurenberg

8709.84 --> 8713.68
medical war criminals

8714.96 --> 8720.16
so i don't need a list

8717.6 --> 8723.16
the list will form itself when the time

8720.16 --> 8723.16
comes

8725.92 --> 8728.92
uh

8748.16 --> 8753.439
five dudes with ears oh yeah yeah well

8751.359 --> 8755.68
hey a woodworking gunny bear well guess

8753.439 --> 8758.319
what's gonna happen to those five dudes

8755.68 --> 8759.439
with the ars that's gonna

8758.319 --> 8761.039999999999
shoot

8759.439 --> 8764.08
thousands

8761.04 --> 8765.76
people wielding knives

8764.08 --> 8768.319
yeah they're all going to kill

8765.76 --> 8768.319
themselves

8768.399 --> 8773.119999999999
because

8770.72 --> 8775.199999999999
these people

8773.12 --> 8778.560000000001
are doing what

8775.2 --> 8780.720000000001
basically god commands

8778.56 --> 8783.039999999999
that's why it's like it's become like

8780.72 --> 8784.88
that this is the end

8783.04 --> 8786.399000000001
they come in

8784.88 --> 8789.279999999999
to end it

8786.399 --> 8790.16
and yeah the soldiers are then going to

8789.28 --> 8792.84
take

8790.16 --> 8794.56
the punishment for every single

8792.84 --> 8795.52
individual

8794.56 --> 8798.64
that they

8795.52 --> 8799.6
defend their precious high-paying master

8798.64 --> 8801.039999999999
for

8799.6 --> 8803.2
they're all gonna [ __ ] kill

8801.04 --> 8804.960000000001
themselves over that

8803.2 --> 8806.880000000001
not too soon after

8804.96 --> 8809.839999999998
because that's the real trauma you can't

8806.88 --> 8813.519999999999
avoid that's not a collective spirit no

8809.84 --> 8814.56
that's the individual soldier

8813.52 --> 8817.68
yeah

8814.56 --> 8820.479
yeah you can't survive that you can't

8817.68 --> 8822.319
shoot 1000 people wielding knives and

8820.479 --> 8825.92
get out of that alive because you're

8822.319 --> 8825.92
going to kill yourself after that

8830.16 --> 8835.84
yeah a mob though

8832.96 --> 8839.358999999999
the rage they

8835.84 --> 8841.28
they just are on fire until it's finally

8839.359 --> 8842.960000000001
over

8841.28 --> 8844.720000000001
and they'll be kind of amnesic

8842.96 --> 8846.14
afterwards like whoa what the [ __ ] did

8844.72 --> 8848.8
we just do

8846.14 --> 8851.84
[Music]

8848.8 --> 8851.84
because it's not the same

8866.88 --> 8873.438999999998
it's the dr manhattan product what

8870.16 --> 8876.399
what is at least g

8873.439 --> 8880.880000000001
oh man my show has been going

8876.399 --> 8880.88
what two and a half hours damn

8888.08 --> 8893.84
what will i do with the children of the

8889.76 --> 8893.84
people like hill uh

8896.24 --> 8898.72
i don't know

8902.88 --> 8908.399
they're just gonna have to get on with

8904.319 --> 8910.399
their lives whatever is left of that

8908.399 --> 8911.84
i think they would all be

8910.399 --> 8913.199999999999
marked

8911.84 --> 8915.439
to be

8913.2 --> 8916.880000000001
basically children of war criminal

8915.439 --> 8918.880000000001
eugenicist

8916.88 --> 8920.88
they should not be publicly mocked for

8918.88 --> 8922.16
that but they should always be kept

8920.88 --> 8925.279999999999
track of

8922.16 --> 8925.28
the rest of their life

8926.24 --> 8931.28
just to make sure that they're not

8927.92 --> 8932.88
secretly there just to survive and carry

8931.28 --> 8937.28
on the same

8932.88 --> 8937.279999999999
spirit of satan to do it all over again

8938.24 --> 8944.0
but yeah

8940.64 --> 8949.08
i don't know send them to orphanages

8944.0 --> 8949.08
there's gonna be orphanages lots of them

8959.12 --> 8961.439
right

8960.0 --> 8964.88
but

8961.439 --> 8966.08
beside that you know a lot of these kids

8964.88 --> 8968.56
from these

8966.08 --> 8972.24
eugenicist psychos

8968.56 --> 8975.76
are already adult and are already part

8972.24 --> 8978.88
of the plan and it's execution they're

8975.76 --> 8978.880000000001
already part of it

8980.0 --> 8984.88
a lot of them are so i don't think there

8982.399 --> 8987.119999999999
will be even that many children left

8984.88 --> 8989.119999999999
most of the people that are doing

8987.12 --> 8992.319000000001
this they're older

8989.12 --> 8994.720000000001
they're not young generation you don't

8992.319 --> 8997.76
start yeah doesn't work they're all

8994.72 --> 8999.92
older people and their children that

8997.76 --> 9002.84
have already become part of the same

8999.92 --> 9005.84
plan they've put everything into all

9002.84 --> 9007.12
this and then the price will be

9005.84 --> 9009.6
everything

9007.12 --> 9009.6
everything

9010.88 --> 9015.438999999998
yeah

9013.04 --> 9017.359
if you make your children a

9015.439 --> 9019.2
soldier

9017.359 --> 9021.84
in a war

9019.2 --> 9022.960000000001
on population

9021.84 --> 9025.359
then

9022.96 --> 9027.119999999999
yeah they're part of that war and then

9025.359 --> 9031.16
that

9027.12 --> 9031.160000000002
has the same end result

9043.359 --> 9047.76
cheer shift

9045.04 --> 9050.080000000002
live fireworks i wasn't expecting that

9047.76 --> 9052.56
though i'm glad it was just that one

9050.08 --> 9055.039999999999
stupid bomb

9052.56 --> 9056.88
i mean i don't mind those bombs but i

9055.04 --> 9060.080000000002
don't like you when they're really close

9056.88 --> 9063.119999999999
by and this one was like

9060.08 --> 9066.12
20 meters away or something it's

9063.12 --> 9066.12
proof

9075.52 --> 9081.92
well they eventually die off anyway yeah

9079.2 --> 9081.92
doesn't matter

9082.24 --> 9086.56
but yeah steaming trevor a lot of these

9084.64 --> 9090.0
eugenicist

9086.56 --> 9092.16
bastards they will kill themselves

9090.0 --> 9094.08
when the game is up

9092.16 --> 9098.72
right they will because they know

9094.08 --> 9098.72
they're gonna be humiliated tortured

9100.0 --> 9105.2
like pried open mentally

9102.479 --> 9107.92
to reveal other secret [ __ ] and these

9105.2 --> 9110.800000000001
people are

9107.92 --> 9112.479
so full of secret darkness it's

9110.8 --> 9114.64
unfathomable

9112.479 --> 9118.08
how much [ __ ]

9114.64 --> 9118.08
they actually have in them

9118.479 --> 9121.599999999999
unfathomable there are psychopaths all

9120.399 --> 9123.92
of them

9121.6 --> 9126.800000000001
like born psycho but you have to be to

9123.92 --> 9129.52
be able to wield that amount of [ __ ] in

9126.8 --> 9131.438999999998
secret anxiety and they do and a lot of

9129.52 --> 9133.84
them will just kill themselves when this

9131.439 --> 9134.960000000001
starts to happen

9133.84 --> 9137.04
just

9134.96 --> 9139.199999999999
kind of wise in a way and very

9137.04 --> 9142.68
convenient because that way nobody else

9139.2 --> 9142.68
has to get traumatized

9147.6 --> 9150.6
so

9174.24 --> 9177.28
just addressing the method yeah that's

9176.16 --> 9179.359
all fine

9177.28 --> 9182.720000000001
mr soldier man

9179.359 --> 9185.439
this is not a soldier issue though

9182.72 --> 9188.24
i mean it could be dude potentially an

9185.439 --> 9190.16
entire revolutionary army especially in

9188.24 --> 9191.6
the us could just literally start

9190.16 --> 9192.8
popping up

9191.6 --> 9195.12
how about

9192.8 --> 9197.759999999998
10 000 people

9195.12 --> 9200.399000000001
with ar-15s and rocket launchers and

9197.76 --> 9202.960000000001
handguns

9200.399 --> 9205.68
how about that miniguns

9202.96 --> 9207.679999999998
all of it yeah dude

9205.68 --> 9210.24
there's no way that can be stopped no

9207.68 --> 9211.76
manner of police force or the military

9210.24 --> 9213.76
they're not going to be quick enough

9211.76 --> 9216.880000000001
unless they're willing to literally just

9213.76 --> 9216.880000000001
blow everything up

9217.359 --> 9221.04
everything

9219.12 --> 9224.76
fire bomb their own country yeah they

9221.04 --> 9224.76
don't think that's gonna happen

9234.0 --> 9238.64
all i'm saying is you don't need weapons

9236.56 --> 9240.479
hands are weapons you can kill somebody

9238.64 --> 9243.479
with your hands you don't actually need

9240.479 --> 9243.479
weapons

9245.28 --> 9249.319000000001
weapons just make it quicker

9267.84 --> 9270.84
uh

9272.64 --> 9277.599999999999
oh yeah george sanford talking about

9274.479 --> 9280.24
which i heard fauci is getting

9277.6 --> 9283.04
the biggest pension any functionary in

9280.24 --> 9284.399
the united states has ever received in

9283.04 --> 9285.439
its history

9284.399 --> 9286.56
yeah

9285.439 --> 9290.64
fauci

9286.56 --> 9294.399
is getting the biggest pension payout

9290.64 --> 9297.279999999999
any functionary in american history has

9294.399 --> 9299.84
ever received in government

9297.28 --> 9303.319000000001
huh

9299.84 --> 9303.319
how about that

9335.08 --> 9338.239
[Music]

9350.96 --> 9356.24
bring him down we'll use a reescape yeah

9353.2 --> 9358.479000000001
good point that might happen

9356.24 --> 9360.0
or he's just gonna

9358.479 --> 9362.479
if the government is up to the

9360.0 --> 9364.24
government live a long and fruitful life

9362.479 --> 9367.119999999999
ever like

9364.24 --> 9367.119999999999
grow old

9367.359 --> 9370.319
well everybody that's ever gotten the

9369.2 --> 9373.439
vax

9370.319 --> 9374.8
actually doesn't grow old and dies in

9373.439 --> 9377.68
pain

9374.8 --> 9377.679999999998
very quickly

9377.84 --> 9384.479
everybody was i'm too busy to do with

9380.84 --> 9387.28
that can't do with that right now

9384.479 --> 9389.679999999998
i'm just trying to keep my life together

9387.28 --> 9389.68
i mean

9392.24 --> 9396.64
i mean why

9393.76 --> 9400.72
why would we go after him after all this

9396.64 --> 9402.72
time it's such a long time ago i mean

9400.72 --> 9404.8
there's like an entire culture that

9402.72 --> 9407.679999999998
sprung forth from

9404.8 --> 9411.119999999999
savage vengeful hatred of hitler you

9407.68 --> 9413.28
know that's lasted over 80 years but i

9411.12 --> 9415.6
mean this guy just committed the

9413.28 --> 9418.16
greatest genocide pretty much

9415.6 --> 9420.479000000001
in the country

9418.16 --> 9423.28
and yeah he could just

9420.479 --> 9425.84
doesn't matter right so now only hitler

9423.28 --> 9428.800000000001
mattered the guy that's actually doing

9425.84 --> 9430.24
worse [ __ ] right now

9428.8 --> 9432.0
right then

9430.24 --> 9434.16
that doesn't matter because i gave my

9432.0 --> 9435.76
keep my life together yeah that's what i

9434.16 --> 9437.6
predict

9435.76 --> 9440.319
in a way

9437.6 --> 9443.359
unless yeah the flashpoint happens and

9440.319 --> 9443.359
then they're all gonna die

9444.24 --> 9451.52
but yeah americans are very good at

9448.399 --> 9453.68
cocking to circumstances like that like

9451.52 --> 9455.439
better than the dutch i mean dutch are

9453.68 --> 9459.04
like

9455.439 --> 9462.800000000001
super adapting [ __ ] like super adaption

9459.04 --> 9467.319000000001
americans are like the best at making

9462.8 --> 9467.319
the worst excuses ever

9467.68 --> 9472.720000000001
america there's nobody

9469.52 --> 9475.92
in the world that can make excuses

9472.72 --> 9478.56
for some repulsive cowardice

9475.92 --> 9481.76
attitude or deed like americans can

9478.56 --> 9486.279999999999
nobody can make excuses for terrible

9481.76 --> 9486.28
behavior like americans can

9495.69 --> 9498.889000000001
[Music]

9499.52 --> 9504.319000000001
yeah that's all very cute work working

9501.68 --> 9504.319
gunny bear

9506.479 --> 9510.0
now if you don't want to have the lord

9508.319 --> 9511.84
in you

9510.0 --> 9514.56
to take your vengeance that's that's

9511.84 --> 9516.880000000001
your issue i don't give a [ __ ] if if you

9514.56 --> 9518.8
think you got a biblical argument

9516.88 --> 9522.16
against what i'm talking about then

9518.8 --> 9525.84
you're a funny zealot

9522.16 --> 9525.84
and you don't know god's plan

9532.0 --> 9537.84
nature

9533.04 --> 9537.84
the way things work is god's plan

9538.08 --> 9542.88
things happening naturally

9540.319 --> 9547.519999999999
is god's plan

9542.88 --> 9547.519999999999
logical consequences are god's plan

9548.08 --> 9553.2
the

9548.84 --> 9555.92
ideas we receive when we receive them

9553.2 --> 9557.84
are part of god's plan

9555.92 --> 9560.960000000001
so who are you to say that everything i

9557.84 --> 9563.52
talked about isn't god's plan

9560.96 --> 9564.8
because you're excluding yourself from

9563.52 --> 9567.2
vengeance

9564.8 --> 9569.279999999999
because you separate yourself from the

9567.2 --> 9571.359
lord

9569.28 --> 9573.52
have you ever thought about it like that

9571.359 --> 9576.52
woodworking gunny bear

9573.52 --> 9576.52
huh

9582.72 --> 9589.399
yeah you go defend your homestead

9585.76 --> 9589.399
you go do that

9614.96 --> 9618.96
can put an end to this without violence

9619.68 --> 9624.800000000001
well that depends on how you're going to

9621.359 --> 9626.640000000001
define his violence but

9624.8 --> 9630.199999999999
not without death

9626.64 --> 9630.199999999999

9709.84 --> 9715.2
in there too and i have to define it i

9712.72 --> 9718.64
have to figure out what it is i feel it

9715.2 --> 9722.16
has a purpose i feel i have a point

9718.64 --> 9725.92
i'm done with this [ __ ] pacifism

9722.16 --> 9725.92
you see i'm really done with it

9726.16 --> 9730.399
there i

9727.439 --> 9734.08
i will not allow

9730.399 --> 9735.358999999999
these people to survive i will not allow

9734.08 --> 9737.84
it

9735.359 --> 9739.6
and so i will figure a way through this

9737.84 --> 9741.76
and through our own

9739.6 --> 9743.12
obstacles and dilemmas that have been

9741.76 --> 9746.08
designed

9743.12 --> 9747.740000000002
specifically for us to prevent that from

9746.08 --> 9750.86
happening

9747.74 --> 9750.86
[Music]

9754.479 --> 9758.16
so i will keep doing what i do

9758.88 --> 9763.438999999998
and if you have some kind of a funny

9760.96 --> 9766.72
christian response to that yeah

9763.439 --> 9766.720000000001
then i reject that

9769.04 --> 9771.279
yeah

9771.68 --> 9776.399
because all these things you say

9774.399 --> 9778.64
do you even know what you're saying or

9776.399 --> 9779.599999999999
are you just taking it

9778.64 --> 9782.56
as

9779.6 --> 9785.279
the context that was handed with you on

9782.56 --> 9786.479
how to interpret it when that happened

9785.279 --> 9789.359
yeah

9786.479 --> 9791.199999999999
yeah because oh vengeance is mine saith

9789.359 --> 9793.84
the lord oh oh so you're not with the

9791.2 --> 9793.84
lord then

9794.88 --> 9799.399
you never thought about it like that did

9796.399 --> 9799.399
you

9803.12 --> 9808.319000000001
what you don't have the lord with you

9806.16 --> 9811.279
in you

9808.319 --> 9814.96
to have his vengeance

9811.279 --> 9816.960000000001
i mean to like a personal strife yeah

9814.96 --> 9820.479
that's really petty and dark and doesn't

9816.96 --> 9822.8
work and you get dramatized but who says

9820.479 --> 9824.0
that the lord cannot have vengeance

9822.8 --> 9826.479
through you

9824.0 --> 9829.479
who says so

9826.479 --> 9829.479
hmm

9831.68 --> 9837.12
