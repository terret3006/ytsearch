[Music]

34.09 --> 36.150000000000006
you

41.97 --> 50.379999999999995
good morning welcome to flatter the

46.48 --> 52.059999999999995
earlybird number 345 i'm your host

50.38 --> 53.89
Arwen and before we start the show

52.06 --> 56.08
please don't forget to share it on any

53.89 --> 57.46
platform you deem fit and also if you

56.08 --> 59.11
haven't already subscribed to my channel

57.46 --> 61.03
and hit the bell notification so you

59.11 --> 63.34
know when i'm going live which is

61.03 --> 65.37
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

63.34 --> 65.37
day

65.41 --> 70.14999999999999
please also to support me and my channel

68.38 --> 72.07
through the paypal patreon my GoFundMe

70.15 --> 78.52000000000001
and the super chest that would be much

72.07 --> 80.74
appreciated so yeah today still still no

78.52 --> 82.78
oh it seems like the sun's just gone

80.74 --> 85.27
behind the cloud there's still some Sun

82.78 --> 94.96000000000001
distance there but it's still this

85.27 --> 99.49
beautiful clear day as some of you may

94.96 --> 107.67899999999999
have noticed I did a premiere this

99.49 --> 110.47
morning tried my p900 out on that clear

107.679 --> 114.16
sky the very bright Sun and yeah it was

110.47 --> 115.99
nice had zooming problems very serious

114.16 --> 119.41
ooming problems but still got some nice

115.99 --> 123.479
shots out of it and just the way it

119.41 --> 126.67
looks is just amazing yeah

123.479 --> 130.06
so hello sleeping warrior thanks for

126.67 --> 136.14000000000001
passing on the the Flat Earth livestream

130.06 --> 139.87
torch was a good hangout you had yeah

136.14 --> 143.01999999999998
hammering back on the nitty-gritty got

139.87 --> 146.31900000000002
so many trawlers triggered oh it's gonna

143.02 --> 150.459
be tough going through this jet because

146.319 --> 155.069
it's already gone wild alright I think

150.459 --> 158.74
Steve was first in the ajm' aka the

155.069 --> 161.04
independent variable so among key 3d to

158.74 --> 161.04000000000002
it with

161.819 --> 177.409
I come move I Kumu virus right George

191.37 --> 201.59
sleeping warrior of course matrix media

195.89 --> 209.27999999999997
mark collared Missouri bear oh dear

201.59 --> 214.68
then this was much longer to it with the

209.28 --> 215.959
studio sixty-eight heavy metal ruined my

214.68 --> 219.95000000000002
life

215.959 --> 219.95000000000002

228.03 --> 240.21
a trigger troll angel of attack great

235.11 --> 244.70000000000002
Mona King yeah Plouffe finally got

240.21 --> 250.53
through that man oh good to see you all

244.7 --> 251.51
move lots of viewers 52 yeah sky is the

250.53 --> 255.51
limit

251.51 --> 266.90999999999997
bare face ready or not

255.51 --> 270.02
for two I got Tamara coffee with me I

266.91 --> 273.63000000000005
love that tea

270.02 --> 276.18
that's it that early lunch again I don't

273.63 --> 279.21
know why but yesterday it was kind of

276.18 --> 283.94
like this just this bright Sun it makes

279.21 --> 283.94
me hungry so I get lunch earlier

289.43 --> 294.5
yeah but I don't know why but just this

292.34 --> 297.919
clear sky and the bright light it helps

294.5 --> 305.21
me focus a lot officially it's just so

297.919 --> 309.74
much detail to see with my eyes it's

305.21 --> 323.35999999999996
quite a spectacle outside no Mex lapel

309.74 --> 330.889
Oh what who is that Tau Ceti alpha got

323.36 --> 347.78000000000003
some control Oh wrecking their stuff and

330.889 --> 350.33
he'll listen yeah yeah the tools yeah in

347.78 --> 353.27
a way it almost feels like what we're

350.33 --> 356.87
doing all together just exposing the

353.27 --> 360.039
truth gaining ground it's like we're

356.87 --> 364.49
getting closer and closer of just

360.039 --> 368.539
hurting them all to the edge of the

364.49 --> 371.62
abyss and they're all going nuts knowing

368.539 --> 373.909
that they're gonna drop in

371.62 --> 379.76
metaphorically that's kind of like how

373.909 --> 382.729
it feels it almost makes me sad but

379.76 --> 386.83
that's just yeah accidental empathy I

382.729 --> 386.83
guess I shouldn't I shouldn't do that

387.409 --> 396.93
because they deserve it through their

390.72 --> 399.97900000000004
actions through their transactions yeah

396.93 --> 405.689
angel of attack gaining a lot of ground

399.979 --> 409.889
like all of it taking every little

405.689 --> 413.58000000000004
element that you used clumsily fantasize

409.889 --> 416.37
your ball together we're all picking it

413.58 --> 420.15
all apart one piece at a time

416.37 --> 423.78000000000003
we're totally re-engineering or reverse

420.15 --> 428.669
engineering reality based on what we can

423.78 --> 431.28
figure out is there are you doing use

428.669 --> 435.68
reusing much of what has been

431.28 --> 438.21
established and just taking the data and

435.68 --> 443.19
taking away the illusions and then

438.21 --> 447.68
leaving what is true and that way we

443.19 --> 451.199
gain ground and you lose ground you lose

447.68 --> 454.77
legitimacy ground for your speculative

451.199 --> 457.469
speculation nonsense more and more so

454.77 --> 460.969
the pressure goes up so you have to get

457.469 --> 463.139
more nuts get more distracting and

460.969 --> 465.779
that's exactly what you all are doing

463.139 --> 468.089
and I wonder if you even consciously

465.779 --> 470.969
realize that that is exactly what you're

468.089 --> 476.75
doing and that's it's not going to get

470.969 --> 476.75
better anytime soon so

477.38 --> 486.17
yeah that's your lies there you know you

481.61 --> 488.48
always try to push me around so the

486.17 --> 491.53000000000003
jesting that I have no life and I know

488.48 --> 494.39000000000004
very much what I have and do not have

491.53 --> 497.86999999999995
but when you really consider where

494.39 --> 503.39
you're going with all these actions and

497.87 --> 506.56
what you prescribe to I don't know I

503.39 --> 511.72999999999996
feel fine if I compare myself to that I

506.56 --> 514.96
really do at least I have some peace of

511.73 --> 514.96
mind in a way

519.15 --> 524.76
right the end that moving the goal posts

521.969 --> 530.1800000000001
is exactly the problem it's the

524.76 --> 533.96
fundamental myth methodological problem

530.18 --> 533.9599999999999
you can't do that

534.74 --> 541.11
you just gotta take what is true for

537.33 --> 543.36
true and stop moving everything around

541.11 --> 547.47
to fit whatever you're trying to

543.36 --> 552.27
visualize or mentally achieve to believe

547.47 --> 555.9300000000001
or support some vision you have to take

552.27 --> 558.93
what is real for what it is and stop

555.93 --> 566.0999999999999
moving around in where you're looking at

558.93 --> 568.55
and just face what is there stop fooling

566.1 --> 573.33
yourself stop making yourself look away

568.55 --> 575.79
face it all the things all the things we

573.33 --> 578.61
say and and don't get distracted by

575.79 --> 582.4499999999999
these social implications or any

578.61 --> 584.49
attitudes just listen to the information

582.45 --> 589.83
just try to bypass all the social

584.49 --> 592.7090000000001
nonsense that's just to rattle rattle

589.83 --> 594.72
things up it's what you do as well you

592.709 --> 598.1999999999999
should know that you apply it all the

594.72 --> 601.1600000000001
time like a bunch of crazy scientists

598.2 --> 604.8000000000001
trying to experiment socially on people

601.16 --> 611.88
it's insane you do it all the time much

604.8 --> 614.8499999999999
worse degree I might add so why don't

611.88 --> 618.24
you just bypass that element which you

614.85 --> 621.48
can identify no take as a separate

618.24 --> 626.25
social entity as it were and just look

621.48 --> 630.48
at the information and face it and then

626.25 --> 633.089
say what comes to heart and even if it

630.48 --> 639.14
contradicts everything you feel or you

633.089 --> 639.1400000000001
want yet you just have to face the truth

639.68 --> 643.04
that's it

653.97 --> 659.61
yeah now there's no our weenie enrage

656.86 --> 659.61
chair sorry

662.25 --> 677.53
the day like this

664.15 --> 681.84
how can anyone rage so anyway yeah let's

677.53 --> 685.24
get back to business uh gas pressure a

681.84 --> 693.69
gas pressure gradient within a very

685.24 --> 700.87
limited space opposing a giant multiple

693.69 --> 704.23
measures bigger sized volume of almost

700.87 --> 707.65
nothing absolutely no pressure at all so

704.23 --> 709.9
without a barrier so try to account for

707.65 --> 715.03
that try to demonstrate anything that

709.9 --> 718.39
can somehow accomplish that do you know

715.03 --> 721.6899999999999
what go all technical nuts on it just

718.39 --> 724.81
don't try to bend things visually just

721.69 --> 728.2
do it physically some way pure leaf

724.81 --> 731.0799999999999
physics electrics whatever magnetics

728.2 --> 737.1400000000001
whatever you want to try but make it gas

731.08 --> 739.36
make it actual gas and get the

737.14 --> 742.81
comparative spaces right because that's

739.36 --> 747.49
the thing a gradient is fundamentally

742.81 --> 754.9899999999999
secondary to a container size a gradient

747.49 --> 758.74
always forms as it does because of what

754.99 --> 763.27
the gases are whatever forces are

758.74 --> 767.62
applied or just the natural relative

763.27 --> 769.03
density spectrum of all things which it

767.62 --> 772.72
will be in if you're going to be

769.03 --> 777.06
building anything right because this is

772.72 --> 780.25
where we are so that is there and

777.06 --> 781.9499999999999
however a gradient forms it's always

780.25 --> 784.32
going to adapt

781.95 --> 787.83
the same way if you use the same amount

784.32 --> 790.86
of gases whatever for the container

787.83 --> 792.69
however it's gonna settle if the volumes

790.86 --> 794.19
and the masses are the same the

792.69 --> 797.6400000000001
gradients always going to be the same

794.19 --> 800.4300000000001
way it's pretty assuredly so so I can

797.64 --> 806.09
definitely conclude that the gradient is

800.43 --> 809.8499999999999
absolutely secondary and specifically

806.09 --> 814.11
specifically secondary told to the size

809.85 --> 816.24
of the container so there's a direct

814.11 --> 818.16
relation into the divisions of whatever

816.24 --> 820.29
is going to be in there to the size of

818.16 --> 823.5
the container now taking this into

820.29 --> 826.38
account there is no example of any kind

823.5 --> 832.17
of gas gradient for anything anything

826.38 --> 836.1899999999999
that manages the show and this includes

832.17 --> 840.3299999999999
water okay anything except for solids

836.19 --> 844.7700000000001
maybe but anything liquid anything fluid

840.33 --> 847.74
any fluids in the container if there's

844.77 --> 850.68
going to be a gradient it's always going

847.74 --> 855.38
to be in the same way and there's not

850.68 --> 858.87
going to be a giant nothing opposing a

855.38 --> 864.12
finer gradient in a tight corner

858.87 --> 866.19
that doesn't happen now if there is for

864.12 --> 869.64
example air and there's other stuff then

866.19 --> 872.5200000000001
yeah there may be like waters not gonna

869.64 --> 874.5
vaporize all that and then yeah that's

872.52 --> 876.18
gonna form that gradient at the bottom

874.5 --> 878.97
but yeah that's because the container is

876.18 --> 880.8
already filled with gas normalizing the

878.97 --> 883.02
situation roughly but if you take all

880.8 --> 886.1099999999999
that gas away then guess what all these

883.02 --> 889.23
fluids will suddenly all start to

886.11 --> 891.54
evaporate and fill that container

889.23 --> 896.15
whatever gradients gonna come out of it

891.54 --> 900.26
it's gonna roughly show the same size

896.15 --> 904.41
relations with the container size

900.26 --> 906.48
because that is how gradients work it's

904.41 --> 911.36
always gonna relate directly to the

906.48 --> 914.8000000000001
container and there is no example

911.36 --> 917.529
involving a vacuum of any kind

914.8 --> 922.269
we're a gas pressure will show a very

917.529 --> 926.529
small or rather a big change in gradient

922.269 --> 928.9590000000001
in a very small space opposing a giant

926.529 --> 933.869
amount of space where there's almost no

928.959 --> 937.029
pressure at all maintaining that

933.869 --> 938.769
gradient relation without some kind of

937.029 --> 941.47
barrier in between those two types of

938.769 --> 942.989
spaces it doesn't exist you can't do

941.47 --> 947.22
that

942.989 --> 952.3290000000001
so there is no reason to believe that

947.22 --> 957.429
that can exist in real life the the

952.329 --> 962.29
second law of thermodynamics supports my

957.429 --> 966.22
assertion in this the gas will expand

962.29 --> 967.689
and fill the containers space and then

966.22 --> 971.999
whatever is going to happen after that

967.689 --> 975.399
yeah a gradient then may result and that

971.999 --> 977.399
gradient will reflect directly upon the

975.399 --> 986.769
size of the container

977.399 --> 990.069
it always does so I hope that supports a

986.769 --> 991.899
little extra to the subject that you

990.069 --> 996.4799999999999
were talking about very eloquently on

991.899 --> 996.48
your show Tony

1009.13 --> 1014.83
right that is exactly right sky's the

1011.8 --> 1018.0999999999999
limit you can only have a gradient

1014.83 --> 1020.32
visible on earth there is not a sky

1018.1 --> 1023.46
vacuum otherwise the gradient spends the

1020.32 --> 1027.25
whole expanding sky vacuum that's

1023.46 --> 1032.08
exactly my point thank you thank you for

1027.25 --> 1043.42
saying that exactly right so that's good

1032.08 --> 1046.6599999999999
I was glad when people getting right and

1043.42 --> 1049.5700000000002
hey that still gives some kind of option

1046.66 --> 1054.3700000000001
though you know there could be a lot of

1049.57 --> 1057.28
space with gas and yeah if you then

1054.37 --> 1059.8
start to indulge get a little sneaky and

1057.28 --> 1067.35
say well maybe it might be some kind of

1059.8 --> 1071.1699999999998
oh and it's the outer gas universe and

1067.35 --> 1074.6799999999998
who knows but yeah that's basically

1071.17 --> 1078.8500000000001
folly because yeah I'm pretty sure that

1074.68 --> 1081.5800000000002
the container is not that big and that

1078.85 --> 1088.8899999999999
the earth is definitely not curved in

1081.58 --> 1092.32
any way resulting in a ball some kind so

1088.89 --> 1098.1000000000001
although you can entertain remote idea

1092.32 --> 1101.71
say oh the Jupiter sized ball these lent

1098.1 --> 1104.59
from the visualization of the

1101.71 --> 1107.38
heliocentric jupiter-sized the giant gas

1104.59 --> 1109.48
ball lent from that and then

1107.38 --> 1115.1200000000001
presupposing that the earth may be of

1109.48 --> 1117.55
that size and as it is trying to explain

1115.12 --> 1122.1299999999999
away there the the visual lack of

1117.55 --> 1122.1299999999999
curvature so yeah that's what that is

1122.72 --> 1124.75
Oh

1134.9 --> 1138.13
wow that's cool

1138.82 --> 1142.769
liquid helium that's crazy

1161.69 --> 1167.96
hmm that's yeah that's a very

1164.539 --> 1172.07
interesting statement of Aquila yeah

1167.96 --> 1175.669
indeed helium becomes liquid at zero

1172.07 --> 1178.4289999999999
Kelvin and how does that support the

1175.669 --> 1181.73
claim of water being up there well it

1178.429 --> 1189.409
doesn't directly I don't know about that

1181.73 --> 1194.0
idea of water being up there also yeah

1189.409 --> 1197.659
it's just a weird just try to think of

1194.0 --> 1201.32
it as a potential mind trick hidden in

1197.659 --> 1204.169
plain sight if they claim ok the waters

1201.32 --> 1208.09
split in all that container right well

1204.169 --> 1210.74
then the freaking flood happened so

1208.09 --> 1213.019
maybe that was the water that was

1210.74 --> 1215.24
hanging up there before that was split

1213.019 --> 1216.889
off and then it was dropped down and now

1215.24 --> 1221.1200000000001
there's no more water there it's just

1216.889 --> 1223.7589999999998
different look it could be like an

1221.12 --> 1225.59
excuse trying to somehow justify

1223.759 --> 1228.2
something that they didn't really

1225.59 --> 1231.559
understand I'm just wildly speculating

1228.2 --> 1238.48
over here now wildly so don't put me

1231.559 --> 1238.48
down on any about this it's just

1239.55 --> 1245.7
I I don't know why you would assume

1243.96 --> 1248.15
there would be water up there in a

1245.7 --> 1251.7
literal sense as the water that we know

1248.15 --> 1257.22
other than that the sky seems blue in

1251.7 --> 1260.43
the day and that you can yeah that's

1257.22 --> 1263.33
like the holographic elements I guess of

1260.43 --> 1266.6100000000001
ripples also remind us of water perhaps

1263.33 --> 1275.55
it's just yeah there are suggestions but

1266.61 --> 1278.0
I don't know how water would stay up

1275.55 --> 1282.78
there well except if it were just

1278.0 --> 1289.71
perfectly frozen ice because then it

1282.78 --> 1292.82
doesn't you had that's the weird thing

1289.71 --> 1292.82
about water isn't it

1295.7 --> 1301.97
it's kind of a conundrum in its own way

1298.85 --> 1304.07
of water and vacuum because if water is

1301.97 --> 1307.18
liquid and then you decrease the

1304.07 --> 1313.9099999999999
pressure that it will evaporate and

1307.18 --> 1316.0700000000002
become water vapor and be I don't know

1313.91 --> 1319.5800000000002
over moved from the chamber as well as

1316.07 --> 1322.55
it is being drawn into a vacuum but if

1319.58 --> 1325.73
the water was a block of ice as you

1322.55 --> 1328.94
decrease the pressure that wouldn't

1325.73 --> 1332.1200000000001
happen I think I think that the block of

1328.94 --> 1334.73
ice will stay frozen as it is even as

1332.12 --> 1336.77
the pressure decreases so if I think it

1334.73 --> 1340.58
could be even so wildly contrasted that

1336.77 --> 1343.28
you could say a block of ice next to

1340.58 --> 1348.02
water that the water would evaporate and

1343.28 --> 1350.99
the ice would not now I am NOT a hundred

1348.02 --> 1353.0
percent sure about this but that yeah if

1350.99 --> 1358.46
you think if there are some legitimacy

1353.0 --> 1361.7
to that set up that I suppose then well

1358.46 --> 1364.1000000000001
booth maybe in some extreme situation

1361.7 --> 1368.0
somehow indeed there is it like it is

1364.1 --> 1372.6799999999998
all covered up by ice that just keeps on

1368.0 --> 1377.57
being suspended there I don't know this

1372.68 --> 1385.6100000000001
is just very rough again mechanical

1377.57 --> 1387.73
based idea of a an enclosure and I don't

1385.61 --> 1387.7299999999998
know

1395.07 --> 1399.02
decrease the pressure and ice turns to

1397.5 --> 1408.12
liquid are you sure

1399.02 --> 1412.11
does it really so ice leaks off into

1408.12 --> 1416.31
does it sublimate them maybe does it

1412.11 --> 1418.05
directly transfer into gas because water

1416.31 --> 1422.3999999999999
can do that as well it's known to be

1418.05 --> 1428.43
able to do that that that's a good point

1422.4 --> 1431.67
so then it couldn't work then ice could

1428.43 --> 1435.89
not maintain its situation under some

1431.67 --> 1440.0600000000002
weird anomalous pressure scenario

1435.89 --> 1440.0600000000002
pressure temperature scenario

1469.16 --> 1475.2
we heard like it's no glue yeah I don't

1473.37 --> 1478.3799999999999
know I don't know if that is the layout

1475.2 --> 1485.43
of the land I know if that I don't know

1478.38 --> 1488.2800000000002
if that orientation is true I don't know

1485.43 --> 1493.5600000000002
if the earth is a disc I know that

1488.28 --> 1495.96
however your just the whole disc map

1493.56 --> 1499.1699999999998
idea seems to just be centered around

1495.96 --> 1502.98
trying to make things centered it's

1499.17 --> 1506.6100000000001
already kind of Helio and yeah lunar

1502.98 --> 1508.8600000000001
centric in a way as it is trying to

1506.61 --> 1513.33
literal eyes the positions of those

1508.86 --> 1517.4299999999998
lights into being at a physical position

1513.33 --> 1520.83
over the flat earth over the realm and

1517.43 --> 1525.3600000000001
the way to achieve that is by projecting

1520.83 --> 1531.36
the land masses oriented into a disc

1525.36 --> 1533.9399999999998
shape but I don't know if that is really

1531.36 --> 1536.8799999999999
the orientation of all the landmasses if

1533.94 --> 1543.0
that is really what it's like I don't

1536.88 --> 1545.42
think so not like that well animation is

1543.0 --> 1545.42
wobbling

1558.89 --> 1563.65
and s-shape one

1565.77 --> 1573.59
and how do you explain that

1582.81 --> 1588.84
you mean basically like the idea of a

1585.66 --> 1591.9
flat globe that it would be a surface

1588.84 --> 1595.3799999999999
sort of interlinking like this the

1591.9 --> 1597.42
infinity symbol idea sort of that that

1595.38 --> 1599.4
is the surface interconnected in that

1597.42 --> 1603.39
weird loopy way yeah there could be it's

1599.4 --> 1608.2800000000002
one of the options it's the West Loop

1603.39 --> 1611.9
and the loops of s what I don't

1608.28 --> 1611.8999999999999
understand what you mean sky's the limit

1612.05 --> 1620.85
but um that's interesting to take note

1616.29 --> 1623.6599999999999
that you're accepting a looping concept

1620.85 --> 1623.6599999999999
to the real

1629.01 --> 1632.21
Book of Enoch

1636.59 --> 1641.83
I think the Book of Enoch would

1638.51 --> 1645.3799999999999
definitely be a very interesting read

1641.83 --> 1648.1
I've never literally read it the way

1645.38 --> 1653.69
I've been exposed to it is through the

1648.1 --> 1655.73
videos of flat water pretty early on it

1653.69 --> 1659.3600000000001
was even a bit scary in a way for me to

1655.73 --> 1672.05
watch that stuff some weird stuff going

1659.36 --> 1675.35
on in very early days weird stuff but

1672.05 --> 1677.3899999999999
yeah that's the way that I do also had

1675.35 --> 1679.73
great imagery of course to support it

1677.39 --> 1685.0300000000002
but I've never literally read or even

1679.73 --> 1685.03
seen any example of that book

1698.64 --> 1706.679
who are you talking to like I don't know

1703.83 --> 1710.25
but Trish is blocked in my chat I didn't

1706.679 --> 1714.98
know if you're aware of that nobody's

1710.25 --> 1714.98
seeing that at least in the Hangout

1725.6 --> 1728.4399999999998
anyway

1737.8 --> 1750.01
oh is it chat stuck again ah that yeah

1748.93 --> 1757.92
I'm noticing it

1750.01 --> 1757.92
thank you for that's just uh-huh

1790.1 --> 1792.76
Wow

1805.88 --> 1810.3200000000002
huh okay Brian nobbut that's good to

1809.84 --> 1814.57
hear

1810.32 --> 1814.57
I didn't know that

1821.75 --> 1826.7
all right oh wait and that's just that

1824.6 --> 1829.73
yeah right okay so the only thing that

1826.7 --> 1830.65
matter is if the US courts say if it is

1829.73 --> 1833.63
true or not

1830.65 --> 1840.47
well what if courts of other countries

1833.63 --> 1843.44
start to say it for example yeah who

1840.47 --> 1848.2
knows maybe the court in England would

1843.44 --> 1852.76
say it what then what does that mean

1848.2 --> 1855.5800000000002
does that mean that there's got to be

1852.76 --> 1858.77
like some kind of division between

1855.58 --> 1860.6599999999999
England and the US or something or what

1858.77 --> 1863.66
do you think the courts will do well

1860.66 --> 1867.98
they just say like yeah maybe it's time

1863.66 --> 1872.69
to do this now I don't know I have no

1867.98 --> 1878.71
idea although there are just signals

1872.69 --> 1884.3500000000001
that it somehow is a controlled release

1878.71 --> 1887.0
that like it was inevitable and they

1884.35 --> 1890.33
despite them not really wanting to let

1887.0 --> 1893.78
go do agree that it may be better this

1890.33 --> 1895.82
way to minimize the damage as it were so

1893.78 --> 1900.52
it yeah that has always been a factor

1895.82 --> 1902.84
I've always been expecting more

1900.52 --> 1905.03
resistance in a way now there is

1902.84 --> 1907.9099999999999
resistance but it seems more it's like

1905.03 --> 1912.41
just political or financial interested

1907.91 --> 1917.24
in some way and not really concerning

1912.41 --> 1919.7
the release about it it's like a little

1917.24 --> 1922.16
release of whatever it's just anything

1919.7 --> 1924.82
goes so that doesn't really seem to

1922.16 --> 1924.8200000000002
matter anymore

1927.84 --> 1935.8899999999999
yeah so in a way it like it's supposed

1931.54 --> 1938.25
to be released on the larger plan scale

1935.89 --> 1944.0200000000002
and they're just leaving it up to

1938.25 --> 1946.53
enthusiasts and let everybody do

1944.02 --> 1951.52
whatever they feel like

1946.53 --> 1954.82
let the opponents arise naturally from

1951.52 --> 1957.61
within the believers ranks as they have

1954.82 --> 1962.29
as the ballers are around and go nuts

1957.61 --> 1968.1
and just doing what following their

1962.29 --> 1968.1
programming and not overcoming it

1987.12 --> 1994.1999999999998
oh did he say that sorry

1990.48 --> 2003.83
I didn't see that one okay I'll call you

1994.2 --> 2013.07
back hello let me get you on screen

2003.83 --> 2015.6799999999998
sorry that's okay yeah let me just give

2013.07 --> 2016.37
the live hang off fire oh yeah so I can

2015.68 --> 2019.04
see what you've got

2016.37 --> 2021.35
okay so I'm gonna do some really

2019.04 --> 2024.59
unorthodox with your permission

2021.35 --> 2027.6799999999998
that depends no no no it's cool Twitter

2024.59 --> 2031.1
it said before Twitter it said in chats

2027.68 --> 2034.5800000000002
that she said no way Anthony and I said

2031.1 --> 2037.1299999999999
no way what with Twitter's response was

2034.58 --> 2039.71
no way that you hold a postgraduate

2037.13 --> 2041.5100000000002
degree in law I'm now going to

2039.71 --> 2042.77
demonstrate live on your show and I've

2041.51 --> 2045.68
never done this before there's only one

2042.77 --> 2050.41
person I've ever done this and - I'm not

2045.68 --> 2050.41
gonna say Who I am gonna show

2052.22 --> 2059.6899999999996
Jonas creature yeah you're we are you

2057.89 --> 2062.15
are screen sharing it's a little small

2059.69 --> 2065.18
though I don't have any presentation

2062.15 --> 2067.76
specific screen what is it you've got a

2065.18 --> 2071.71
screen of me in the minute oh yeah

2067.76 --> 2075.65
that's okay yeah sure all right so this

2071.71 --> 2078.23
this here is somebody called Morgan's

2075.65 --> 2080.65
beverage he's not in the discussion this

2078.23 --> 2084.05
is back in the day when I researched

2080.65 --> 2086.1800000000003
someone else that wasn't fires related I

2084.05 --> 2088.1000000000004
said something and that's and she said

2086.18 --> 2090.2599999999998
this is the funniest thing I have ever

2088.1 --> 2092.6
seen from a law point of view I am

2090.26 --> 2094.01
extremely doubtful of your qualification

2092.6 --> 2095.96
the seeing is you don't understand a

2094.01 --> 2097.7000000000003
simple point of law do you mind telling

2095.96 --> 2100.1
me your practice and what university

2097.7 --> 2102.83
your LLB is from so what I did was I

2100.1 --> 2104.06
copied a picture and I got my stiffness

2102.83 --> 2106.1
of my post-grad

2104.06 --> 2108.29
not my undergrad my post-grad because

2106.1 --> 2109.19
this supersedes Manchester Metropolitan

2108.29 --> 2111.35
University

2109.19 --> 2113.4700000000003
Antony Reilly has rewarded the polt

2111.35 --> 2115.8199999999997
Graduate Diploma of the University

2113.47 --> 2118.4599999999996
having followed an approved program in

2115.82 --> 2120.1800000000003
legal practice in October 2009 that's

2118.46 --> 2123.299
like 10 years ago

2120.18 --> 2125.0989999999997
so now what I do is I go to Manchester

2123.299 --> 2128.279
Metropolitan University and all like to

2125.099 --> 2130.349
do this all I do is MMU dot a see UK

2128.279 --> 2132.72
that gives me the website for University

2130.349 --> 2135.3900000000003
of Manchester click on study and then go

2132.72 --> 2137.6699999999996
to postgraduate and then what I do is I

2135.39 --> 2139.98
search course now we remember we remind

2137.67 --> 2141.119
ourselves what the course was called now

2139.98 --> 2143.4
the reason why I'm doing this is because

2141.119 --> 2146.039
Twitter its challenged me post graduate

2143.4 --> 2147.9900000000002
diploma in legal practice so we go back

2146.039 --> 2151.98
to the website and we type in legal

2147.99 --> 2153.5989999999997
practice and then this will bring up the

2151.98 --> 2155.76
courses that are available in this

2153.599 --> 2158.099
institution for legal practice and there

2155.76 --> 2160.5
is the legal practice course full time I

2158.099 --> 2162.539
did mine and when we click into it we

2160.5 --> 2164.339
can see that it gives an overview it

2162.539 --> 2166.8590000000004
tells us about what it kind of does and

2164.339 --> 2168.599
then what we do is we entry requirements

2166.859 --> 2170.88
to enroll on the LPC you need to satisfy

2168.599 --> 2172.9500000000003
us that you have a qualifying law degree

2170.88 --> 2175.77
so that's what I had to get on this

2172.95 --> 2177.93
course a qualifying law degree by virtue

2175.77 --> 2180.39
of this certificate I've been awarded

2177.93 --> 2183.1189999999997
the post graduate diploma in legal

2180.39 --> 2186.18
practice that twit wit is a legal

2183.119 --> 2188.579
practice certificate in law that is the

2186.18 --> 2190.23
bit prior to what Trish Blythe would

2188.579 --> 2192.119
have which will be a practice difficut

2190.23 --> 2194.549
she would have an equivalent

2192.119 --> 2197.6400000000003
qualification that qualifies her to be

2194.549 --> 2199.41
in practice as a barrister she would

2197.64 --> 2201.15
have this she doesn't have it

2199.41 --> 2203.609
she can't produce it won't produce it

2201.15 --> 2206.13
and has behind an amenity now to be fir

2203.609 --> 2208.5
I would probably do the same if I was in

2206.13 --> 2209.73
practice so there is a valid reason for

2208.5 --> 2213.119
why she wouldn't do it

2209.73 --> 2215.309
but that doesn't mean that I cannot tell

2213.119 --> 2217.17
that she's lying and I know she's lying

2215.309 --> 2219.329
because I can demonstrate that she did

2217.17 --> 2222.779
incorrect legal research when she

2219.329 --> 2225.3900000000003
refused to go to the Dimmick case site

2222.779 --> 2227.549
the judges regret words in support of

2225.39 --> 2230.0989999999997
her assertion that was we need to go

2227.549 --> 2231.69
back to the act well if you go back to

2230.099 --> 2233.9100000000003
the Act that means you dismissed the

2231.69 --> 2236.099
lead case in Dimmick and you can't do

2233.91 --> 2237.99
that lawfully not not it's not the

2236.099 --> 2240.1800000000003
correct practice you should be

2237.99 --> 2242.64
demonstrating with citation from the

2240.18 --> 2243.97
lead case your position your argument

2242.64 --> 2246.0989999999997
points

2243.97 --> 2247.8689999999997
Trish Blythe did not do this she

2246.099 --> 2250.2400000000002
dismissed that by one end to go back to

2247.869 --> 2252.099
the act well you can't go back to the

2250.24 --> 2254.3799999999997
act when you have a lead case because

2252.099 --> 2255.819
although you can try and argue that that

2254.38 --> 2257.53
means that you're dismissing the current

2255.819 --> 2259.24
lead case and the judges are not gonna

2257.53 --> 2260.77
be favorable with that because he's

2259.24 --> 2262.4399999999996
supposed to be cites in the correct

2260.77 --> 2264.94
position the up-to-date position in law

2262.44 --> 2266.26
Trish went backwards she should have

2264.94 --> 2268.089
gone forwards and she should have

2266.26 --> 2270.789
formulated their arguments based on the

2268.089 --> 2273.52
lead case Trish did not do this and for

2270.789 --> 2274.9300000000003
that reason I can call reasonably that

2273.52 --> 2277.66
she's not a qualified lawyer or

2274.93 --> 2279.8489999999997
barrister because no barrister or lawyer

2277.66 --> 2283.1499999999996
would argue that the current position is

2279.849 --> 2284.92
to go back to the act nobody would do

2283.15 --> 2286.539
that the only time you would go back to

2284.92 --> 2288.91
the act is when you do not have a lead

2286.539 --> 2291.01
case and treat and we do have a lead

2288.91 --> 2292.48
case so you would never go backwards you

2291.01 --> 2294.789
would try and argue you're arguing

2292.48 --> 2297.19
points based on going forwards because

2294.789 --> 2300.039
that progresses the legal points you

2297.19 --> 2301.39
don't regress it you progress it and if

2300.039 --> 2303.6090000000004
you're gonna regress you're gonna

2301.39 --> 2304.8689999999997
justify for why and that means that

2303.609 --> 2307.15
you've got to argue that the judge in

2304.869 --> 2309.579
the Dimmick case was wrong so for the

2307.15 --> 2311.2000000000003
benefit just of twit wit there is my

2309.579 --> 2313.8390000000004
proof that I have a post graduate

2311.2 --> 2315.3689999999997
diploma in legal practice from the great

2313.839 --> 2317.41
University of Manchester as it's now

2315.369 --> 2319.15
called and you will see that the

2317.41 --> 2321.279
qualification criteria to get on it is

2319.15 --> 2325.69
as I said a qualifying law degree which

2321.279 --> 2327.4
I have no woman there is called Jackie

2325.69 --> 2328.9900000000002
Panzer and she's still there I think is

2327.4 --> 2331.9900000000002
that Jackie Panzer yeah Jackie Panzer

2328.99 --> 2335.3089999999997
she's still there she taught me course

2331.99 --> 2338.25
details to do this you have to study BLP

2335.309 --> 2341.25
PLP civil and criminal litigation

2338.25 --> 2344.319
professional conduct accounts wills

2341.25 --> 2346.119
writing drafting and this bit here is

2344.319 --> 2348.609
where Trish fails practical legal

2346.119 --> 2351.4300000000003
research because Trish did not move the

2348.609 --> 2353.95
case forward she regressed to a previous

2351.43 --> 2356.89
state dismiss in the application of the

2353.95 --> 2360.0099999999998
judges words in Dimmick for that reason

2356.89 --> 2362.5
I can say that she is not a practicing

2360.01 --> 2364.9300000000003
barrister and if she is a practicing

2362.5 --> 2366.849
barrister then she should be complying

2364.93 --> 2368.5589999999997
with practical legal research and she

2366.849 --> 2370.63
should be forming our arguments based on

2368.559 --> 2371.92
the decision in Dimmick which is what I

2370.63 --> 2374.7690000000002
did

2371.92 --> 2376.1800000000003
to go back to the act is not doing what

2374.769 --> 2378.339
she was taught in practical legal

2376.18 --> 2380.6499999999996
research and I don't think there's a

2378.339 --> 2382.75
difference in Australian law to England

2380.65 --> 2386.529
law we will have both been taught the

2382.75 --> 2389.23
same thing for this reason she is not a

2386.529 --> 2391.569
qualified practicing barrister if she is

2389.23 --> 2393.279
she's just wrong but I don't think she

2391.569 --> 2394.5389999999998
is a practicing barrister so I'm gonna

2393.279 --> 2396.099
call her on and I have called her on it

2394.539 --> 2397.42
and I don't think she is and I'm

2396.099 --> 2400.0
qualified to say that she's not because

2397.42 --> 2401.41
she's doing somebody incorrect so I'm

2400.0 --> 2403.75
all right with to it wit saying that I

2401.41 --> 2405.7599999999998
don't have a cup my post-grad in law

2403.75 --> 2408.369
I've just demonstrated for everybody

2405.76 --> 2410.079
that I do I don't normally do this oh

2408.369 --> 2413.319
I'm by the way for the benefit of

2410.079 --> 2415.0
everybody file information you can see

2413.319 --> 2418.5099999999998
that that picture was taken on the 20th

2415.0 --> 2420.069
of February 2017 I think I might be a

2418.51 --> 2422.829
girl over can change that can I change

2420.069 --> 2424.029
that oh yeah I can I'm gonna put it

2422.829 --> 2427.4500000000003
about 17 because that was when it was

2424.029 --> 2429.49
taken 20th of February 17 and it was

2427.45 --> 2432.46
done because I was done on a phone that

2429.49 --> 2434.319
I no longer have PSP three whatever but

2432.46 --> 2437.049
that was taken for this person here and

2434.319 --> 2439.63
I put her picture on screen so I'm

2437.049 --> 2441.67
qualified to call her on it and if she

2439.63 --> 2445.259
doesn't want to for docs reasons I don't

2441.67 --> 2447.13
blame her however I can demonstrate a

2445.259 --> 2449.589
legitimate reason for why she's not

2447.13 --> 2451.92
because I have been granted a pole to

2449.589 --> 2454.599
graduate diploma in legal practice

2451.92 --> 2456.7000000000003
against twit wits assertion of not I

2454.599 --> 2459.099
just want I thought I'd mention that to

2456.7 --> 2460.359
it wit because I quite liked it which

2459.099 --> 2461.8590000000004
she cause a lot of people on both sides

2460.359 --> 2463.119
but at least credit me for when I've

2461.859 --> 2465.7889999999998
demonstrated that I have complied with

2463.119 --> 2470.4100000000003
what a challenge was because I I do have

2465.789 --> 2474.579
a post-grad in Lille in law yeah you

2470.41 --> 2484.019
definitely yeah they've proven that with

2474.579 --> 2489.069
that thank you so idea Tricia's a mess

2484.019 --> 2491.7099999999996
yeah if I'm wrong I'm happy to be

2489.069 --> 2492.849
corrected and she won't do offline or

2491.71 --> 2494.529
online that's fine

2492.849 --> 2495.7000000000003
but I'm happy to call her on it because

2494.529 --> 2497.71
I don't believe for a minute that she's

2495.7 --> 2499.1189999999997
qualified I think she's a paralegal I

2497.71 --> 2500.319
think she's been doing it for 15 years

2499.119 --> 2502.15
and she's got a close friendship with

2500.319 --> 2504.099
the boss black doesn't mean she's a

2502.15 --> 2505.2690000000002
barrister because a barrister wouldn't

2504.099 --> 2505.57
make the mistakes you made in practical

2505.269 --> 2508.0
legal

2505.57 --> 2509.8900000000003
which was the point that I made so I

2508.0 --> 2511.81
mean you can take that however you want

2509.89 --> 2512.7999999999997
to it wit but I am qualified to spot it

2511.81 --> 2514.39
and I know when she's doing something

2512.8 --> 2515.8900000000003
wrong so she has done something wrong

2514.39 --> 2518.1099999999997
you don't know it and you can question

2515.89 --> 2520.12
me on it that's fine but I do know it

2518.11 --> 2521.6800000000003
and I can demonstrate it and she refuses

2520.12 --> 2523.21
to back down and I'm like well that's

2521.68 --> 2528.85
not what what happening causes it let's

2523.21 --> 2531.25
be honest right so let's get back to

2528.85 --> 2536.2599999999998
Flat Earth I had some complaints in

2531.25 --> 2539.25
check yeah Trish I barely take notice of

2536.26 --> 2544.75
her anymore but yeah the blocking helps

2539.25 --> 2548.38
yeah haven't heard from rest in a while

2544.75 --> 2550.03
either to be fur that's whilst he's been

2548.38 --> 2551.35
brought up I've not heard from rusta for

2550.03 --> 2554.32
a while the last thing I heard from him

2551.35 --> 2555.94
was Trish claimed that Nathan and Riley

2554.32 --> 2557.8300000000004
had supported her assertion that she was

2555.94 --> 2560.68
a barrister and she was hiding behind

2557.83 --> 2561.1
that and I I was I wanted to see proof

2560.68 --> 2562.6
of that

2561.1 --> 2564.22
no he hasn't been online for ages I

2562.6 --> 2565.75
don't know if he's away or whatever he

2564.22 --> 2566.9199999999996
could be avoiding the topic because he

2565.75 --> 2569.14
might not be able to find the evidence

2566.92 --> 2571.84
that he believes exists but on the other

2569.14 --> 2572.29
hand I just not sent him so if roster is

2571.84 --> 2573.76
out there

2572.29 --> 2575.59
come on roster let's see where you're up

2573.76 --> 2576.94
to at least if you've not got the

2575.59 --> 2578.4100000000003
evidence that supports the assertion

2576.94 --> 2580.9
that she said something that she claims

2578.41 --> 2582.67
that she didn't at least admit that you

2580.9 --> 2585.82
can't find it because that's what I

2582.67 --> 2589.81
would be expected to do roster right

2585.82 --> 2593.4900000000002
well maybe he's just not ready to start

2589.81 --> 2600.2799999999997
to face Thresh in any kind of way that

2593.49 --> 2602.89
like I I get it I get it it's just to

2600.28 --> 2606.3700000000003
lose on the nitpicky thing can be

2602.89 --> 2608.79
extremely annoying when your opponent is

2606.37 --> 2611.83
just acting like complete trash it's

2608.79 --> 2614.29
it's really extra annoying so I totally

2611.83 --> 2616.2999999999997
get it if that it might be the case that

2614.29 --> 2622.33
he just couldn't find it back was just

2616.3 --> 2625.02
lost in the in the sea of videos but

2622.33 --> 2628.71
yeah anyway

2625.02 --> 2630.96
enough about all that to be further I

2628.71 --> 2631.98
mean if he did lose on a minor point so

2630.96 --> 2633.75
what would the bigger point is that

2631.98 --> 2636.0
she's still not a barrister whether she

2633.75 --> 2638.46
said it or not yeah it supports Rusty's

2636.0 --> 2639.93
claim that she did say if she did but if

2638.46 --> 2641.119
she didn't doesn't change the father

2639.93 --> 2645.35
she's not a barrister

2641.119 --> 2648.1800000000003
yeah yeah that's why it's just a minor

2645.35 --> 2649.38
point by now I know but to be fair

2648.18 --> 2650.94
roster should really come out and say

2649.38 --> 2652.59
you know what I can't find it if it

2650.94 --> 2655.56
exists I can't find it maybe it didn't

2652.59 --> 2658.619
exist I might have made a mistake he's

2655.56 --> 2662.66
not been alive for ages so now I've seen

2658.619 --> 2666.33
there's girlfriend around online though

2662.66 --> 2671.6
there's a case who's his girlfriend does

2666.33 --> 2675.06
he bakes cakes comments it's very nice

2671.6 --> 2677.91
but anyway maybe he's just thrown

2675.06 --> 2681.57
himself onto another project as well you

2677.91 --> 2683.64
know he's kind of busy guy these days

2681.57 --> 2687.81
hey did you see that I got a super chart

2683.64 --> 2691.89
not a super chat donation oh yeah yeah

2687.81 --> 2696.18
yeah it was from oh no way I can't

2691.89 --> 2697.5
remember what his name is now it's the

2696.18 --> 2701.46
guy that's been given Nathan [ __ ]

2697.5 --> 2707.01
recently and on our side sx0

2701.46 --> 2709.29
oh yeah okay why you donated to you yeah

2707.01 --> 2711.2700000000004
you give me ten quid ten British pounds

2709.29 --> 2713.13
oh I mean I never asked for it and I

2711.27 --> 2715.05
appreciate Alice spotted it come through

2713.13 --> 2721.369
and as I off shouts OS X zero

2715.05 --> 2721.369
I was amazing congratulations

2721.79 --> 2725.369
you know he's been doing a bit of fur

2724.08 --> 2727.14
trolling recently doesn't he's on our

2725.369 --> 2729.48
side but he's been trolling a bit so I

2727.14 --> 2731.58
don't know what is up with that guy I

2729.48 --> 2734.13
know that's why I mention it

2731.58 --> 2736.7999999999997
come on let's X what's going on it's

2734.13 --> 2740.34
almost seems like he just gets confused

2736.8 --> 2742.5600000000004
into accidentally becoming a baller like

2740.34 --> 2745.05
literally like that it's just very weird

2742.56 --> 2747.39
under the beds I don't know what's going

2745.05 --> 2748.6800000000003
on with that guy it's actually healthy

2747.39 --> 2750.359
in the overall because if he calls

2748.68 --> 2753.99
people out on the stuff that he doesn't

2750.359 --> 2755.31
agree with that's actually good but it's

2753.99 --> 2758.43
just difficult to do it without losing

2755.31 --> 2762.0
friends I don't know what it is like

2758.43 --> 2764.25
my TB trying to become a flatterer and

2762.0 --> 2766.829
he just accidentally falls back on

2764.25 --> 2774.27
typical baller assumptions is is that

2766.829 --> 2776.04
what that is I I don't know not sure but

2774.27 --> 2777.619
I'm surprised when I saw his name pop up

2776.04 --> 2781.02
because Nate he's been trolling Nathan's

2777.619 --> 2782.21
for a while yeah Nathan treated him

2781.02 --> 2787.099
pretty hard

2782.21 --> 2789.78
so we any kind of deserved it hey hey

2787.099 --> 2791.069
look who's talking I'm not trolling at

2789.78 --> 2795.3900000000003
all sx0

2791.069 --> 2796.98
thank you for the $5 well I was

2795.39 --> 2798.3289999999997
surprised I'll be honest cuz I said no

2796.98 --> 2800.16
he's been with Nathan recently and I'm

2798.329 --> 2802.17
like what side sex on I'm not quite sure

2800.16 --> 2806.0989999999997
but if he's trolling on flatter side

2802.17 --> 2807.66
it's actually good it's not bad cuz you

2806.099 --> 2812.21
never see ballers trolling each other do

2807.66 --> 2817.02
you now they're much better at just

2812.21 --> 2819.78
sniveling living or worship e towards

2817.02 --> 2827.069
the globe try to evade some kind of

2819.78 --> 2829.5890000000004
negative attention - it says so did you

2827.069 --> 2832.89
pass the bar Anthony twit wit and the

2829.589 --> 2836.04
bar is the opposing equal and opposite

2832.89 --> 2839.069
qualification the bar is for it's called

2836.04 --> 2840.599
the BBC the bar vocational course the

2839.069 --> 2842.849
bar vocational course is what qualifies

2840.599 --> 2844.349
you to be a barrister the qualification

2842.849 --> 2847.17
that qualifies you to be a solicitor is

2844.349 --> 2849.42
the LPC so instead of the BBC for

2847.17 --> 2851.28
barristers is the LPC for solicitors and

2849.42 --> 2852.75
the answer is yes I presented the

2851.28 --> 2853.7400000000002
certificate that shows I passed the the

2852.75 --> 2856.44
LPC

2853.74 --> 2860.24
so yes to it I did pass it that's the

2856.44 --> 2860.2400000000002
qualification represented thank you

2864.65 --> 2869.42
that's special thank you for that Laurie

2870.16 --> 2874.5789999999997
- it says you guys love Trish before she

2872.96 --> 2876.41
criticized you Anthony I've got no

2874.579 --> 2878.15
problem with Trish I still like Trish I

2876.41 --> 2879.77
still agree with a viewpoint in the

2878.15 --> 2882.17
sense that she presented the best iron

2879.77 --> 2883.7889999999998
I've seen so far that doesn't mean I

2882.17 --> 2886.039
like her or dislike her it just means

2883.789 --> 2887.51
that when she argues an argument that's

2886.039 --> 2889.6090000000004
not based on correct legal researched

2887.51 --> 2891.6800000000003
and I'm gonna disagree with it but that

2889.609 --> 2893.42
doesn't mean I dislike her so let's not

2891.68 --> 2895.0389999999998
make it personal I'm just pointing out

2893.42 --> 2896.75
that your arguments are not based in

2895.039 --> 2899.21
good law they're based in incorrect

2896.75 --> 2913.16
legal research and for that reason I can

2899.21 --> 2917.0
point that out what is happening at the

2913.16 --> 2920.5389999999998
moment besides well this situation with

2917.0 --> 2922.609
Trish because I kind of want to move on

2920.539 --> 2924.5
I haven't seen Trish in weeks

2922.609 --> 2927.049
I'm not sure what it is she's still

2924.5 --> 2930.319
around I have no idea I've blocked her

2927.049 --> 2931.7599999999998
for a long time I've not seen her for

2930.319 --> 2933.77
ages but then again I've not been gone

2931.76 --> 2935.809
josé's since his recent outburst against

2933.77 --> 2937.67
me and against you and against both the

2935.809 --> 2939.829
people to it which says Law School is

2937.67 --> 2941.69
completely different in the UK law

2939.829 --> 2943.3390000000004
school in the UK's I don't know if it is

2941.69 --> 2945.23
different or not but I know that the LPC

2943.339 --> 2946.49
the qualification I got qualified me not

2945.23 --> 2949.94
to be a barrister qualified me to be a

2946.49 --> 2951.859
lawyer a solicitor and a bvc would be

2949.94 --> 2954.079
what she requires to be a barrister and

2951.859 --> 2955.91
I've shown I've got the qualification to

2954.079 --> 2957.4700000000003
be a lawyer she's not demonstrated and

2955.91 --> 2959.5389999999998
I'm not saying this should I agree with

2957.47 --> 2963.8489999999997
their right to be anonymous but I just

2959.539 --> 2968.3900000000003
don't believe her no and neither do I

2963.849 --> 2971.42
because she's just she's proven herself

2968.39 --> 2974.3289999999997
in actual technical arguments that she's

2971.42 --> 2977.15
very capable of bluffing about things

2974.329 --> 2979.069
that in retrospect turned out she

2977.15 --> 2982.099
doesn't actually know anything about it

2979.069 --> 2983.5389999999998
she's just grabbing for words just like

2982.099 --> 2985.6090000000004
a lot of ballers do by the way

2983.539 --> 2989.63
and she's done that in technical

2985.609 --> 2993.0789999999997
argument so it's just this is a proven

2989.63 --> 2996.589
swindler she's just improvising trying

2993.079 --> 3000.1890000000003
to pretend like she's all this

2996.589 --> 3004.199
that's what it seems like to me take

3000.189 --> 3004.199
that Lahti you know could see you in 300

3004.439 --> 3008.319
watch it what's your position with

3006.489 --> 3012.699
Lottie is your position would not see

3008.319 --> 3017.319
balance light stone no no no no Lottie

3012.699 --> 3021.069
is like in a way he's like a P Mars that

3017.319 --> 3024.13
doesn't go over the over the edge but he

3021.069 --> 3028.989
really does push it at times he's Volga

3024.13 --> 3031.9
low that's why I say did but never so

3028.989 --> 3033.5190000000002
bad that it's like okay now I'm

3031.9 --> 3035.829
literally getting nauseated and you

3033.519 --> 3040.41
gotta get out here but he does push the

3035.829 --> 3040.4100000000003
limit he is still a troll in nature so

3040.709 --> 3052.689
but yeah I've had worse yeah right

3051.039 --> 3057.009
the baits are starting in 10 minutes I

3052.689 --> 3059.3489999999997
think really nice flow yeah you know you

3057.009 --> 3061.539
talked a lot about the judicial thing

3059.349 --> 3063.13
considering concerning trician it's good

3061.539 --> 3065.559
to have that all on the table for a

3063.13 --> 3068.619
moment at least because it has been on

3065.559 --> 3070.509
the show before for some reason yeah I

3068.619 --> 3071.949
could even show I actually found on one

3070.509 --> 3074.679
of my old phones and I've uploaded to my

3071.949 --> 3076.449
PC I took a picture inside one of the

3074.679 --> 3078.039
classrooms in the university and I can

3076.449 --> 3079.63
show where I was in the classroom in the

3078.039 --> 3081.759
within the actual university and it's

3079.63 --> 3083.469
like it was taken at the time and it's

3081.759 --> 3084.64
just lovely so it's like I've never

3083.469 --> 3086.38
really done it in this topic because

3084.64 --> 3087.779
I've never really had the reason to no

3086.38 --> 3090.039
one's ever really made an issue of it

3087.779 --> 3091.63
until Trish come along and she's not

3090.039 --> 3093.1890000000003
really made the issue but she's kind of

3091.63 --> 3095.049
made the issue for herself and to

3093.189 --> 3097.209
justify my challenge on it I can say

3095.049 --> 3099.369
well I need to justify myself to justify

3097.209 --> 3101.0789999999997
my challenge so that Sue and I wasn't

3099.369 --> 3102.759
really gonna do but it doesn't change

3101.079 --> 3103.6600000000003
the fact that I can call her on it and I

3102.759 --> 3106.179
just don't believe that she's a

3103.66 --> 3107.859
qualified practicing barrister don't

3106.179 --> 3109.4790000000003
think she's got our product but then

3107.859 --> 3110.589
again all she needs is a certificate

3109.479 --> 3112.749
with a name like she can Blair our

3110.589 --> 3114.7889999999998
surname show the real name on it like

3112.749 --> 3116.499
you first name is Patricia you surname

3114.789 --> 3120.179
is blacked out and then we'll accept it

3116.499 --> 3124.1789999999996
which you won't isn't it just a typical

3120.179 --> 3128.13
prerequisite in general for somebody in

3124.179 --> 3129.9990000000003
that type of practice right to be

3128.13 --> 3131.889
generally technically

3129.999 --> 3135.0389999999998
recked about a lot of things in order to

3131.889 --> 3139.2090000000003
even be able to wield any of it to any

3135.039 --> 3142.3590000000004
results and she's not bathed like that

3139.209 --> 3145.739
she's just messing around bluffing a lot

3142.359 --> 3145.739
getting caught on Bluffs

3145.989 --> 3154.659
so no she's as John would say a

3149.559 --> 3157.2690000000002
pretender clown big big in a big way and

3154.659 --> 3159.549
I call it a grifter somebody just tries

3157.269 --> 3163.5389999999998
to borrow their way into a community

3159.549 --> 3167.169
pretend oh and then get herself tagged

3163.539 --> 3170.679
involved and for power

3167.169 --> 3173.939
that's what grifters do mmm she's not

3170.679 --> 3173.9390000000003
really that good at it either

3175.469 --> 3185.919
are you going on Nathan's yeah yeah sure

3179.619 --> 3187.989
why not did you see my my balloon video

ago so take a look it's funny oh did you

3200.949 --> 3211.809
catch my four more hours loop of the

3204.359 --> 3214.0589999999997
debate 1001 what do you mean did you see

3211.809 --> 3216.639
that it's on it's on our winni in Bear

3214.059 --> 3217.5690000000004
Channel oh no I'm not even familiar that

3216.639 --> 3221.9990000000003
no you don't

3217.569 --> 3221.999
okay well check out our whinnying bear

3227.639 --> 3232.629
find it hey Owen I'm just looking at

3231.099 --> 3236.139
that clear blue sunny October skies

3232.629 --> 3238.179
uncut mm-hmm you know on the Penal do

3236.139 --> 3240.5190000000002
the system with the p900 right mm-hmm on

3238.179 --> 3243.369
the circle control at the back if you

3240.519 --> 3245.319
press down you can lock the focus so

3243.369 --> 3247.059
that it locks it into distance so that

3245.319 --> 3249.189
it's not constantly out of focus or it's

3247.059 --> 3250.719
not constantly searching it yeah press

3249.189 --> 3252.4289999999996
down and then it will give you like a

3250.719 --> 3253.059
mountain on one side and it will give

3252.429 --> 3255.339
you a flower

3253.059 --> 3256.719
on the other scroll it right the way

3255.339 --> 3258.159
down to mountain side a couple of

3256.719 --> 3260.0190000000002
notches off mountain and then it'll

3258.159 --> 3262.629
always be locked into the into the

3260.019 --> 3263.85
distance so it will never be Compton but

3262.629 --> 3268.47
that works even as

3263.85 --> 3271.2599999999998
as you're recording yeah I'm not sure I

3268.47 --> 3273.93
know how to change the photo settings

3271.26 --> 3276.9
but the video settings seem to have been

3273.93 --> 3278.97
set and I can't change anything as I'm

3276.9 --> 3280.62
recording a real interrupter recording

3278.97 --> 3284.8199999999997
that's what I've experienced so far so

3280.62 --> 3286.2599999999998
but I may try it out if that works press

3284.82 --> 3289.23
the preview button so that you get the

3286.26 --> 3290.55
screen on the display of what you're

3289.23 --> 3292.7400000000002
looking at and then when you've got the

3290.55 --> 3294.3300000000004
preview pressed down and then it'll give

3292.74 --> 3296.3399999999997
you the option to scroll left and right

3294.33 --> 3298.2
for mountain or flower scroll it right

3296.34 --> 3299.67
the way down to mountain leave it on

3298.2 --> 3301.83
mountain and then when you press record

3299.67 --> 3303.54
it'll stay locked on that focus that was

3301.83 --> 3305.52
what runs he always failed to do on this

3303.54 --> 3307.68
camera and I know we sit on yours now

3305.52 --> 3310.41
because obviously it's been set then

3307.68 --> 3312.72
adjustable automatic zoom you don't want

3310.41 --> 3314.2799999999997
it on auto zoom auto focus you want it

3312.72 --> 3319.6499999999996
on manual focus and lock it to the

3314.28 --> 3322.52
distance I'll try fooling around with it

3319.65 --> 3326.88
I haven't tried it yet I should be more

3322.52 --> 3329.25
experimental just like make sloppy

3326.88 --> 3331.02
mistake so I get how it works

3329.25 --> 3333.69
did you get a cap did you get the manual

3331.02 --> 3336.18
with it no I didn't I I do have it

3333.69 --> 3338.73
downloaded somewhere I think yeah read

3336.18 --> 3339.66
it you it's really good to slow the

3338.73 --> 3341.13
stuff in it there that you're not

3339.66 --> 3345.21
realize exists unless you know it's

3341.13 --> 3348.23
there all right let's go to jump or

3345.21 --> 3349.95
let's go on let's go on hi John Nathan's

3348.23 --> 3352.86
right ok

3349.95 --> 3353.7599999999998
hey thanks for popping by and it's good

3352.86 --> 3356.01
to have you on the show

3353.76 --> 3359.67
cool no worries man oh and apparently

3356.01 --> 3363.4500000000003
Effie forever was Trish she did sound

3359.67 --> 3366.66
like that happy forever was Trish that

3363.45 --> 3369.62
wouldn't surprise me at all she's not

3366.66 --> 3374.25
try to be just a nasty

3369.62 --> 3375.72
wide manipulator with trolls that's ok

3374.25 --> 3377.58
but I mean that's that's cool but the

3375.72 --> 3379.4399999999996
thing it doesn't change the fact that at

3377.58 --> 3380.97
the end of the day if the earth is a

3379.44 --> 3384.4700000000003
sphere it should stand up to scrutiny

3380.97 --> 3388.02
time and time again and it doesn't

3384.47 --> 3389.7599999999998
indeed it doesn't and that's the whole

3388.02 --> 3391.65
point of what we're doing with the Flat

3389.76 --> 3394.4700000000003
Earth debates is pointing at where it

3391.65 --> 3397.44
doesn't work and then the ballers have

3394.47 --> 3400.8799999999997
become professional deviator Zoar

3397.44 --> 3405.599
the argument yeah

3400.88 --> 3408.859
they wield fallacies like a weapon to

3405.599 --> 3408.8590000000004
evade the argument

3410.66 --> 3416.93
let's go mofo it's two minutes to indeed
