102.799 --> 109.52000000000001
because yeah situations

106.96 --> 111.119
i don't want to go over all that again

109.52 --> 114.399
so

111.119 --> 117.92
uh right yeah

114.399 --> 122.07900000000001
as you can see by my shirt it's

117.92 --> 125.04
not as whoa as warm as what uh

122.079 --> 129.84
as it used well my my webcam got

125.04 --> 129.84
entangled hold on

130.24 --> 137.68
[Music]

133.52 --> 140.72
very often anyway this is wires

137.68 --> 143.84
it's not all advantage uh yeah the

140.72 --> 143.84
weather today is

143.92 --> 149.599
cloudy with a couple of blue spots

147.28 --> 150.879
but it's overall not warm and it's been

149.599 --> 153.51899999999998
raining a lot

150.879 --> 155.35999999999999
so it just cooled down significantly it

153.519 --> 158.87900000000002
might get a little warmer

155.36 --> 161.28
although i guess i should consider that

158.879 --> 162.879
right now should be the warmest point in

161.28 --> 165.84
the day

162.879 --> 165.84
it's not that warm

166.48 --> 172.72
especially if you go outside

169.68 --> 174.64000000000001
so yeah a bit of a

172.72 --> 176.72
break from the heat wave i guess it's

174.64 --> 178.39999999999998
good i think the plants are going to be

176.72 --> 180.0
very happy with all that extra rain

178.4 --> 181.84
because it has been like really

180.0 --> 184.56
continually raining pretty much since

181.84 --> 187.28
yesterday evening

184.56 --> 187.28
continually

187.76 --> 192.239
and it's been odd for me because like

190.319 --> 194.95899999999997
the cooldown

192.239 --> 197.12
why it certainly woke me up you know

194.959 --> 199.28
it's like uh

197.12 --> 200.64000000000001
finally the temperature level goes down

199.28 --> 202.319
and then certainly i get

200.64 --> 203.67999999999998
like at least one and a half times as

202.319 --> 208.0
active

203.68 --> 211.36
up to two times drinking coffee again

208.0 --> 212.08
uh but also yeah then this ha i remember

211.36 --> 213.92000000000002
this this

212.08 --> 215.12
typically happens it's like when there's

213.92 --> 218.48
a certain cooldown

215.12 --> 221.68
after heat wave for some reason

218.48 --> 224.48
there's certain muscles

221.68 --> 225.36
that don't handle that transition very

224.48 --> 228.39999999999998
well

225.36 --> 230.64000000000001
so i tend to get typically temporary

228.4 --> 233.12
back problems and [ __ ]

230.64 --> 234.159
and sometimes can be really bad where

233.12 --> 237.36
like in

234.159 --> 238.239
like if in the transition from heat to

237.36 --> 240.959
cold if

238.239 --> 241.519
that is during the sleep and i don't

240.959 --> 243.519
know

241.519 --> 244.959
i'm basically lying on the very thin

243.519 --> 246.87900000000002
sheets only to protect me from the

244.959 --> 249.519
mosquitoes because it's way too warm

246.879 --> 250.56
and then i sleep through the cold as it

249.519 --> 254.08
gets in

250.56 --> 257.12
then the body is like completely

254.08 --> 260.56
and then you can typically wake up all

257.12 --> 264.639
like a contorted skeleton very annoying

260.56 --> 267.68
it's not as bad this time and

264.639 --> 267.68
but still yeah

267.84 --> 276.56
the muscles need some time to adapt

273.12 --> 276.56
i feel a bit stiff like that

277.12 --> 281.6
but yeah with the tumeric coffee and

279.36 --> 285.28000000000003
extra selenium and all that

281.6 --> 288.32000000000005
should all be fine right so

285.28 --> 290.32
yeah it's been a while but i got green

288.32 --> 293.28
tea again

290.32 --> 293.68
i kind of missed it but yeah with the

293.28 --> 297.919
heat

293.68 --> 301.12
it's just not that pleasant to drink

297.919 --> 302.639
when it's colder however it can be very

301.12 --> 305.6
nice

302.639 --> 307.199
so i got that again uh let's see who is

305.6 --> 310.47900000000004
in chat

307.199 --> 312.56
how i managed this time to start pretty

310.479 --> 316.15999999999997
well on time i think this time

312.56 --> 318.4
i got the routine it just

316.16 --> 319.68
the only issue now is that my intro

318.4 --> 321.52
takes a little longer because

319.68 --> 324.32
after i start up i have to subtly

321.52 --> 327.19899999999996
quickly arrange a lot of things like get

324.32 --> 327.919
links put it in there blah blah blah and

327.199 --> 330.08
yeah

327.919 --> 331.19899999999996
normally i do that before i start up the

330.08 --> 334.4
show

331.199 --> 336.479
but now it's almost like my intro

334.4 --> 338.4
it could use another half a minute or a

336.479 --> 340.96
minute and then i'd probably start up

338.4 --> 343.52
right away after i

340.96 --> 344.63899999999995
yeah after the movie or after the video

343.52 --> 346.639
has finished but

344.639 --> 347.68
anyway i'll deal with it and i'm getting

346.639 --> 350.639
quicker

347.68 --> 351.44
hey i started on time this time at least

350.639 --> 355.52
anyway

351.44 --> 359.36
in chat agm was first michael o'rourke

355.52 --> 359.35999999999996
over mukul matthew mitchell

359.68 --> 362.479
good servant

363.68 --> 367.84000000000003
tom parker seeking star water

370.88 --> 381.84
yeah good to see you all ah it's tuesday

383.52 --> 388.15999999999997
right yeah i made some notes from

386.4 --> 392.0
yesterday i should have probably made

388.16 --> 392.0
a couple of more notes but i kind of

392.84 --> 395.84
forgot

396.24 --> 401.44
yeah flat earth debates was great it was

398.56 --> 404.08
good being on there

401.44 --> 404.08
and uh

404.479 --> 408.31899999999996
yeah went through some a lot of details

406.56 --> 411.52
i got a lot of room

408.319 --> 413.12
you know nathan does praise me and i i

411.52 --> 415.599
really do like that

413.12 --> 416.319
well i i've grown to like it because

415.599 --> 418.479
remember

416.319 --> 420.319
i don't know for some who might remember

418.479 --> 421.039
like two years ago in the start and all

420.319 --> 423.84000000000003
that

421.039 --> 424.71999999999997
i got kind of nervous if i got praise it

423.84 --> 428.15999999999997
was like

424.72 --> 430.72
but i'm useless i'm just a stupid

428.16 --> 432.319
social welfare weirdo somewhere in the

430.72 --> 434.47900000000004
netherlands you know that's

432.319 --> 437.199
so i felt nervous every time about the

434.479 --> 441.039
praise but now yeah i've built up i've

437.199 --> 445.199
pulled through i've got a style

441.039 --> 448.08
i've got growth room and people see it

445.199 --> 450.319
and so now yeah for me praise is now

448.08 --> 453.75899999999996
just like confirmation and

450.319 --> 456.96000000000004
sort of social advertising

453.759 --> 460.56
and yeah nathan does mean it

456.96 --> 462.84
so i really appreciate that uh

460.56 --> 464.479
also like a lot of the reruns he's been

462.84 --> 467.44
playing

464.479 --> 468.31899999999996
have been very good reruns in which i

467.44 --> 472.16
have

468.319 --> 474.16
yeah i put down some stuff i like that

472.16 --> 475.36
don't put myself down mate you're not a

474.16 --> 477.759
weirdo

475.36 --> 478.96000000000004
yes agm i know but i'm talking about two

477.759 --> 482.319
years ago and yes

478.96 --> 484.0
i am a weirdo the issue is though is

482.319 --> 487.599
that

484.0 --> 490.8
the rest of the world is also

487.599 --> 494.479
pretty weird except they're

490.8 --> 494.479
just weird in other ways

496.879 --> 500.08000000000004
that's how i see it now

500.96 --> 507.84
yeah hey stasmarets

504.56 --> 507.84
see you

509.039 --> 513.68
uh right

512.159 --> 515.519
anyway the flat earth debates were

513.68 --> 518.4789999999999
pretty good

515.519 --> 520.88
it's a good part of it and was funny i

518.479 --> 523.2
think chaiki came in again

520.88 --> 525.279
and yeah you know you do get to miss

523.2 --> 527.6
that live action

525.279 --> 528.64
of basically ballers getting grinded it

527.6 --> 532.9590000000001
i don't know maybe

528.64 --> 536.16
it's like a weird addiction or something

532.959 --> 538.64
this is it's such a weird ritual

536.16 --> 540.3199999999999
especially because the ballers sit

538.64 --> 543.36
through it all

540.32 --> 544.9590000000001
like those weirdo yeah they did the

543.36 --> 546.16
doubling down ballers they sit through

544.959 --> 549.3599999999999
it all

546.16 --> 552.56
and it's such a weird fun

549.36 --> 555.92
yeah social phenomena

552.56 --> 558.0
that that happens but

555.92 --> 560.24
it makes me giggle a lot in the

558.0 --> 563.44
background

560.24 --> 564.88
i don't do that on the mic constantly

563.44 --> 568.0
because it would get annoying

564.88 --> 569.279
but i do it sometimes because it is

568.0 --> 572.72
really [ __ ] funny

569.279 --> 575.04
it is it's not like oh my god this is so

572.72 --> 576.72
harsh no it is freaking hilarious

575.04 --> 578.88
because these people are out of their

576.72 --> 581.519
minds

578.88 --> 583.04
they're literally just double speaking

581.519 --> 586.24
the most

583.04 --> 587.92
rudimentary basics you can imagine

586.24 --> 590.32
and then thinking like they're winning

587.92 --> 593.4399999999999
it's they're they are completely

590.32 --> 594.6400000000001
psychotic in that like you know people

593.44 --> 596.72
can have things wrong

594.64 --> 598.56
people can have issues that hold them

596.72 --> 599.44
back their ego that stops them from

598.56 --> 602.4799999999999
getting things

599.44 --> 605.519
but these people are like their whole

602.48 --> 608.0
mental oversight has been so

605.519 --> 610.0
destabilized that they yeah they could

608.0 --> 613.6
be technically

610.0 --> 615.92
considered psychotic at it because their

613.6 --> 616.8000000000001
their brazen double think that that is

615.92 --> 619.1999999999999
really a

616.8 --> 622.0
sign that you that it's just completely

619.2 --> 622.0
destabilized

623.12 --> 629.92
if you can accept just blatant errors

627.279 --> 631.6
as part of your way of going about

629.92 --> 634.7199999999999
anyway

631.6 --> 636.88
right so that happened pretty good uh

634.72 --> 638.399
yeah big bear was live again also very

636.88 --> 640.959
funny

638.399 --> 643.44
and he kept repeating for some reason

640.959 --> 646.64
not all jews are pedos

643.44 --> 648.8800000000001
and yeah we got that but yeah there were

646.64 --> 651.36
plenty of examples of

648.88 --> 653.2
yeah the opposite of that in his video

651.36 --> 656.48
so he went through all that again

653.2 --> 660.24
probably uh plenty of squirting

656.48 --> 662.32
going on out there in response to that

660.24 --> 664.16
but it was yeah it was funny to sit

662.32 --> 668.5600000000001
through that again

664.16 --> 672.16
uh oh yeah

668.56 --> 675.8389999999999
i watched the video through who did i

672.16 --> 675.8389999999999
get that

676.32 --> 680.88
i have to find it back i put it in chat

678.88 --> 685.279
somewhere in the skype

680.88 --> 685.279
it was a video called that hideous

686.839 --> 689.839
strength

690.88 --> 697.68
right right right yeah i think

694.32 --> 700.88
did paul hall actually post that

697.68 --> 703.12
that video i think he did and it was

700.88 --> 705.68
yeah i clicked it and it was really

703.12 --> 710.079
surprisingly good

705.68 --> 713.92
because it is basically a very early on

710.079 --> 716.6389999999999
scientist approach

713.92 --> 718.3199999999999
about the problems that were going to be

716.639 --> 721.44
foreseen concerning

718.32 --> 722.24
dealings dealing with science because

721.44 --> 725.6
yeah people

722.24 --> 726.72
already foresaw even louis c clarke who

725.6 --> 729.9200000000001
is a science fiction

726.72 --> 732.32
author and all that he saw that coming

729.92 --> 735.36
like it's going to be

732.32 --> 737.44
politicized and yeah

735.36 --> 738.88
it's a good video so i definitely

737.44 --> 742.48
recommend

738.88 --> 744.959
all of you watch it it's very doable

742.48 --> 748.32
very very doable it's only 10 minutes

744.959 --> 748.3199999999999
and 32 seconds long

749.519 --> 755.279
with a lot of yeah actual on camera old

752.959 --> 757.04
footage of people

755.279 --> 761.36
with that and yet i don't know it's

757.04 --> 761.36
worth it i thought it was a good video

768.0 --> 771.68
very broad i don't know there might be

770.8 --> 774.0
some

771.68 --> 775.279
misconceptions but it's like multiple

774.0 --> 777.36
people

775.279 --> 780.639
giving their view on things and they may

777.36 --> 782.72
be slightly contradicting here and there

780.639 --> 784.639
about certain issues that might become

782.72 --> 786.72
apparent but i thought it was overall

784.639 --> 789.04
very good video for only ten and a half

786.72 --> 792.72
minutes long so

789.04 --> 794.88
uh yeah enjoy that link that hideous

792.72 --> 798.24
strength

794.88 --> 801.6
louise c.s lewis oh wait not

798.24 --> 804.32
lewis c clarke or is it

801.6 --> 806.32
cs lewis's prophetic warning against the

804.32 --> 810.1600000000001
abuse of science

806.32 --> 815.839
right um

810.16 --> 815.8389999999999
right what was i doing after that

821.44 --> 826.839
right i haven't watched any netflix at

823.6 --> 829.839
all yesterday i don't know it comes and

826.839 --> 829.839
goes

830.079 --> 834.079
oh yeah almost forgot

834.48 --> 837.6800000000001
uh what's it again

838.48 --> 843.6
no more news the yeah the uh what is it

842.32 --> 846.9590000000001
the

843.6 --> 849.279
the jew obsessed guy

846.959 --> 851.4399999999999
who's been going on for a long time but

849.279 --> 853.279
i do tap into him kind of the same

851.44 --> 854.1600000000001
reasons i tap into some other people

853.279 --> 857.92
because he is

854.16 --> 861.199
very extensive in his

857.92 --> 864.4799999999999
in his research despite yeah

861.199 --> 867.76
him always trying to lay connections

864.48 --> 869.839
like to the max sometimes unreasonable

867.76 --> 871.68
and yeah you have to spot that you have

869.839 --> 872.8800000000001
if you take everything he says literally

871.68 --> 876.2399999999999
you're just going to be

872.88 --> 877.6
going go insane you're going to go full

876.24 --> 880.32
safanye mode

877.6 --> 881.6800000000001
which i think he is he's pretty much a

880.32 --> 886.9590000000001
savage

881.68 --> 891.68
but yeah this time he was addressing the

886.959 --> 894.399
the millie weaver alex jones situation

891.68 --> 896.2399999999999
and with the movie that he watched and

894.399 --> 897.36
he had some interesting things to say

896.24 --> 900.48
about it

897.36 --> 902.399
so i did actually sit through that even

900.48 --> 907.44
commented in this chat somewhere

902.399 --> 910.959
i rarely do that because yes it's a mess

907.44 --> 913.36
but yeah it was it

910.959 --> 914.7199999999999
just made it look like it is a little

913.36 --> 917.76
bit more complex

914.72 --> 919.76
than we may think but he yeah

917.76 --> 921.8389999999999
you know how he thinks everything is

919.76 --> 923.92
always caused by

921.839 --> 926.0790000000001
by israel according to him like

923.92 --> 928.8
everything everything everything so

926.079 --> 929.5999999999999
and i don't go with that although i do

928.8 --> 931.4399999999999
yeah

929.6 --> 934.32
i'm not going to underestimate their

931.44 --> 934.32
influence either

936.399 --> 941.839
so i did sit through that i should just

938.399 --> 941.839
make a note

948.639 --> 956.48
oh yeah also what it was weird man

952.32 --> 959.0400000000001
a a dutch rap video from a guy that's

956.48 --> 960.0
getting that's getting pretty famous i

959.04 --> 963.8389999999999
think

960.0 --> 968.32
grassroots uh longer france

963.839 --> 972.1600000000001
long french i guess i don't know

968.32 --> 974.8000000000001
france france how do you pronounce

972.16 --> 976.399
what is the the anglifica anglified

974.8 --> 979.519
version of that name

976.399 --> 983.68
franz i don't know

979.519 --> 986.8
but yeah he's he made a video

983.68 --> 991.519
tall france okay whatever

986.8 --> 991.519
he made a video that i caught

993.36 --> 1000.88
from like a conspiracy theorist's view

996.399 --> 1000.88
that was like yeah reasonable

1001.6 --> 1007.519
a little paranoid here and there

1004.72 --> 1011.519
but still pretty good video it's it's

1007.519 --> 1016.32
not about flat earth though but

1011.519 --> 1016.32
yeah if you if you know any dutch

1016.639 --> 1022.88
you might enjoy it it's a three minute

1019.759 --> 1024.64
clip music video

1022.88 --> 1038.079
but it's all in dutch so if you don't

1024.64 --> 1043.439
know dutch it's going to be like what

1038.079 --> 1043.4389999999999
so yeah those are the links for today

1046.319 --> 1051.44
angelo frank oh

1049.52 --> 1052.799
frank yeah but the problem is is that

1051.44 --> 1055.52
frank is also

1052.799 --> 1055.52
a dutch name

1059.36 --> 1063.28
maybe it's just all compacted in just

1061.679 --> 1064.3200000000002
frank i don't know how it works i've

1063.28 --> 1066.559
never

1064.32 --> 1069.52
never thought about it before what is it

1066.559 --> 1069.52
in english i don't know

1077.28 --> 1086.0
there's a lot of weird switches in names

1080.88 --> 1086.0
from dutch to english so

1088.48 --> 1092.84
right anyway that's it for the notes and

1090.559 --> 1096.0
the links and

1092.84 --> 1099.76
so i'm open

1096.0 --> 1104.0
oh it's weird and getting a bit sweaty

1099.76 --> 1104.0
maybe it's warmer than i thought

1106.84 --> 1111.6499999999999
hmm

1108.44 --> 1111.65
[Music]

1113.84 --> 1116.799
francisco

1120.84 --> 1123.84
hmm

1124.559 --> 1128.48
all right okay says moretz that that

1126.72 --> 1130.24
would make sense

1128.48 --> 1133.679
but then it'll get weird like would he

1130.24 --> 1137.36
be called like cisco

1133.679 --> 1139.039
because i've heard cisco as a name

1137.36 --> 1140.3999999999999
and that's probably derived from that as

1139.039 --> 1142.4
well i don't know man

1140.4 --> 1143.44
i think it's up for the person what they

1142.4 --> 1145.76
want to be

1143.44 --> 1145.76
called

1147.919 --> 1152.0800000000002
english subtitles okay okay that's good

1160.72 --> 1165.44
anyway most of the song is focused at

1163.039 --> 1167.039
the deep state and all that situation in

1165.44 --> 1170.3200000000002
corona and

1167.039 --> 1179.84
so yeah anyway you'll figure that out

1170.32 --> 1179.84
when you see it

1195.44 --> 1207.6000000000001
right so anything anything

1198.799 --> 1212.1589999999999
noteworthy that happened that i missed

1207.6 --> 1212.1589999999999
oh yeah by the way i think uh

1218.559 --> 1221.84
is it live

1229.84 --> 1237.039
doesn't say live all right so there's no

1233.28 --> 1240.1589999999999
it says kiwi live on the picture but

1237.039 --> 1243.6
he doesn't say it's a live panel

1240.159 --> 1245.919
i don't know because yeah everybody that

1243.6 --> 1249.6789999999999
likes qe by now knows that he

1245.919 --> 1263.8400000000001
on saturday but also on tuesday

1249.679 --> 1263.8400000000001
so that's the day

1272.73 --> 1277.84
[Music]

1274.84 --> 1277.84
hmm

1278.559 --> 1286.559
london real is doing a documentary

1281.679 --> 1291.8400000000001
named plan dammit okay

1286.559 --> 1291.84
i i don't know who london reel is but

1308.24 --> 1311.1200000000001
hey kung fe

1317.039 --> 1320.96
okay that's where it's why yeah i don't

1319.28 --> 1323.52
do facebook you know i linked to

1320.96 --> 1324.48
facebook yesterday because it just

1323.52 --> 1327.84
happened to work

1324.48 --> 1329.919
i don't have facebook i never use it

1327.84 --> 1331.12
if there's a video on there that i could

1329.919 --> 1336.159
watch

1331.12 --> 1337.84
then yeah i will watch it

1336.159 --> 1341.44
but i'm not a part of facebook and i'm

1337.84 --> 1345.12
not informed about what goes on on there

1341.44 --> 1347.44
unless i just happen to bump into it

1345.12 --> 1349.1999999999998
and it doesn't demand for me that i have

1347.44 --> 1352.88
an account

1349.2 --> 1352.88
in order to watch anything about it

1353.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
all right after on site sure

1370.4 --> 1389.8400000000001
hey amanda young did you just come in

1373.44 --> 1389.8400000000001
yeah hello

1400.64 --> 1405.5200000000002
holy damn it's getting hot in here what

1403.44 --> 1408.159
is this

1405.52 --> 1409.28
i thought it was cool oh it's getting

1408.159 --> 1411.919
warmer again

1409.28 --> 1416.08
because i am starting to get sticky here

1411.919 --> 1431.8400000000001
this is annoying

1416.08 --> 1431.84
maybe well whatever

1434.64 --> 1447.3600000000001
could also be the tea heating me up

1444.64 --> 1447.3600000000001
uh anyway

1453.76 --> 1457.2
i'm gonna need to take a breather

1455.36 --> 1459.84
because i'm freaking cooking here what

1457.2 --> 1459.8400000000001
is this

1472.24 --> 1476.24
i think it's just the humidity mostly

1484.48 --> 1489.84
ah thank you for the 99 cent super chat

1487.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
donation good servant

1489.84 --> 1501.84
of the weird smiley

1503.76 --> 1508.96
so yeah anyway guys if you got something

1506.72 --> 1508.96
uh

1509.12 --> 1512.8799999999999
flat smacked my neighbor the other day

1510.799 --> 1516.4
they were shocked about kovit

1512.88 --> 1518.72
payton at least they don't wear masks

1516.4 --> 1518.72
yeah

1518.799 --> 1524.12
the whole situation is such as

1521.52 --> 1526.24
[ __ ] of

1524.12 --> 1527.76
misinformation and everything flipped

1526.24 --> 1530.4
around everything to tell you it's just

1527.76 --> 1530.4
the opposite

1534.48 --> 1538.08
and i think that everybody is the most

1536.4 --> 1539.6000000000001
baffled about how they're getting away

1538.08 --> 1542.72
with it all

1539.6 --> 1545.84
how can this persist even after things

1542.72 --> 1548.159
are basically proven to be the exact

1545.84 --> 1551.36
opposite of what they said

1548.159 --> 1553.8400000000001
why is it still going why

1551.36 --> 1557.84
isn't it shut down and investigated and

1553.84 --> 1557.84
all that

1565.679 --> 1572.5590000000002
oh yeah well rob h i don't look i don't

1569.039 --> 1574.48
see it this idea that

1572.559 --> 1576.32
light is literally off the

1574.48 --> 1579.679
electromagnetic spectrum

1576.32 --> 1582.0
i i i'm not gonna go with that

1579.679 --> 1584.4
i don't think it is you know i think

1582.0 --> 1587.679
that light

1584.4 --> 1590.799
yeah in all man-made cases anyway

1587.679 --> 1593.76
unless you use like a chemical fire

1590.799 --> 1594.48
type situation to create the light it's

1593.76 --> 1597.6
not

1594.48 --> 1598.0
electricity light is not electricity no

1597.6 --> 1601.6789999999999
light

1598.0 --> 1604.88
is always caused by electricity

1601.679 --> 1609.2
basically overloading the energy

1604.88 --> 1612.64
of matter so you got electricity

1609.2 --> 1616.24
you got matter and because of that

1612.64 --> 1618.88
light comes from that so i don't see it

1616.24 --> 1621.2
as electric you can't just turn

1618.88 --> 1622.4
electricity into light no no it's always

1621.2 --> 1625.76
the interaction with

1622.4 --> 1629.76
matter that causes the light you know

1625.76 --> 1633.2
a a lightning bolt

1629.76 --> 1633.52
from a thunderstorm the electricity is

1633.2 --> 1635.6000000000001
not

1633.52 --> 1637.84
the light no no no what is actually

1635.6 --> 1642.48
causing that mighty flash

1637.84 --> 1644.559
is the electricity lighting up the gases

1642.48 --> 1645.84
it's going through and that is what is

1644.559 --> 1649.36
giving off the light

1645.84 --> 1651.279
not the electricity see so i think

1649.36 --> 1654.559
this is a misconception i don't think

1651.279 --> 1657.2
light is in the spectrum of electricity

1654.559 --> 1657.2
secondary

1665.52 --> 1671.36
but anyway good question anyone got any

1668.799 --> 1671.36
more of that

1676.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
matthew mitchell yeah

1694.48 --> 1701.2
visible light spectrum is part of the

1696.96 --> 1701.2
electromagnetic radiation spectrum

1701.679 --> 1706.96
i'm sorry i disagree i don't see it

1705.76 --> 1708.72
you know there may be a lot of

1706.96 --> 1710.24
correlations even like pattern

1708.72 --> 1713.279
correlations but

1710.24 --> 1716.64
i don't think it's the same

1713.279 --> 1720.48
you can't just use

1716.64 --> 1724.48
light in some way and turn it into

1720.48 --> 1727.76
like literally turn it into electricity

1724.48 --> 1728.96
without a photoelectric effect and the

1727.76 --> 1733.36
other way around

1728.96 --> 1735.679
you can yeah turn electricity

1733.36 --> 1737.6789999999999
without interacting with matter into

1735.679 --> 1740.5590000000002
light so this is just not true

1737.679 --> 1743.2
it's not the same substance it's just a

1740.559 --> 1747.36
correlation

1743.2 --> 1749.44
that's what i think yeah i disagree with

1747.36 --> 1752.4799999999998
many many people that's right

1749.44 --> 1754.88
yeah many many many people

1752.48 --> 1756.0
the vast vast majority of the world and

1754.88 --> 1758.0800000000002
increasing

1756.0 --> 1760.24
i bet as time goes on there will be more

1758.08 --> 1764.08
people that disagree with me

1760.24 --> 1766.0
from that side from the standard side

1764.08 --> 1768.32
there will be more disagreements

1766.0 --> 1770.32
you know people already probably quite

1768.32 --> 1771.6789999999999
confused maybe even pissed off at me

1770.32 --> 1774.559
that i'm

1771.679 --> 1777.039
like i dare to say that the sun is not

1774.559 --> 1781.12
an object

1777.039 --> 1783.52
yeah that that really confuses the [ __ ]

1781.12 --> 1786.799
out of the vast majority of people

1783.52 --> 1791.039
so yeah more disagreements as time

1786.799 --> 1794.6399999999999
passes but at the same time

1791.039 --> 1796.08
closer closer to me more willing to try

1794.64 --> 1799.3600000000001
to understand

1796.08 --> 1802.799
those people they will

1799.36 --> 1805.279
basically slowly climb the steps

1802.799 --> 1806.799
and figure out what it actually means

1805.279 --> 1807.36
that i'm saying where i'm getting it

1806.799 --> 1809.279
from

1807.36 --> 1810.9599999999998
even though i have basically laid down

1809.279 --> 1813.44
all the arguments just because i lay

1810.96 --> 1815.1200000000001
down the arguments concisely and clearly

1813.44 --> 1817.52
doesn't mean that people will understand

1815.12 --> 1821.36
it you know

1817.52 --> 1823.039
they have to first have room inside of

1821.36 --> 1826.08
them in order to actually

1823.039 --> 1828.08
absorb and analyze it

1826.08 --> 1829.84
and the other stories that i've been

1828.08 --> 1836.08
raised with are still

1829.84 --> 1840.6399999999999
in the way

1836.08 --> 1843.6789999999999
yeah so from all sides unknowingly

1840.64 --> 1846.3200000000002
it's just misconceptions that have

1843.679 --> 1846.3200000000002
gone through

1846.72 --> 1864.159
through family cultures and stories

1851.36 --> 1866.9599999999998
yeah just happens anyway

1864.159 --> 1867.6000000000001
right yeah john joke i know that all of

1866.96 --> 1870.96
this or

1867.6 --> 1876.32
most of the celestial bodies that are

1870.96 --> 1876.32
that have distinct surface

1876.559 --> 1881.36
elements to them like the moon

1879.6 --> 1883.12
sunspots and all that but probably

1881.36 --> 1886.9599999999998
others too yeah they rotate

1883.12 --> 1890.399
guess how they rotate they rotate

1886.96 --> 1893.76
exactly like a clock

1890.399 --> 1895.36
or counter clock they never rotate like

1893.76 --> 1898.1589999999999
this

1895.36 --> 1899.6789999999999
no no no they don't they always rotate

1898.159 --> 1904.48
like this or this

1899.679 --> 1906.799
yeah all of it it's part of the effect

1904.48 --> 1909.2
it's kind of unusual that every

1906.799 --> 1910.08
celestial body in the entire universe

1909.2 --> 1914.24
that we see

1910.08 --> 1917.039
always rotates exactly around an axis

1914.24 --> 1919.36
that faces you straight on isn't that

1917.039 --> 1921.2
isn't that just fascinating

1919.36 --> 1923.36
that is not true oh really prove it to

1921.2 --> 1923.3600000000001
me

1923.6 --> 1926.6399999999999
where's your example

1927.919 --> 1937.279
of non-clock rotation

1934.0 --> 1940.48
yeah look not true wrong or you're

1937.279 --> 1949.039
not true that's not providing a contrary

1940.48 --> 1952.679
proof to that no no no

1949.039 --> 1955.679
john jacob yeah that's your

1952.679 --> 1957.519
interpretation you are presupposing it

1955.679 --> 1960.64
is a physical object

1957.519 --> 1964.159
like that no no how did that

1960.64 --> 1965.279
stuff over the surface moves it's one

1964.159 --> 1967.44
thing

1965.279 --> 1968.399
a moon rotates though and counter

1967.44 --> 1971.8400000000001
rotates and

1968.399 --> 1974.559
i think that if like the whole thing is

1971.84 --> 1977.6
rotating in any provable weight

1974.559 --> 1978.799
it's never going to be very clearly like

1977.6 --> 1981.12
this you know

1978.799 --> 1983.039
even the sunspots you know i've seen

1981.12 --> 1985.76
that because paula bible literally

1983.039 --> 1986.48
she did some sun videos and some uh like

1985.76 --> 1989.6
with a

1986.48 --> 1992.32
polaroid filter special filter

1989.6 --> 1993.76
the sunspots for prolonged times and you

1992.32 --> 1997.039
know what that showed

1993.76 --> 1999.039
it showed the sun if you're going to

1997.039 --> 2000.8799999999999
have some physicality assumption bias

1999.039 --> 2001.44
well it seems to me much more like the

2000.88 --> 2004.5590000000002
sun

2001.44 --> 2007.919
basically has these sunspots on a giant

2004.559 --> 2011.12
strip behind the hole and it just

2007.919 --> 2014.72
moves like this it doesn't

2011.12 --> 2015.9189999999999
move like this because if it moves like

2014.72 --> 2019.1200000000001
this

2015.919 --> 2021.6000000000001
then yeah the angular speeds of the dots

2019.12 --> 2023.12
changes and all that it doesn't it moves

2021.6 --> 2033.84
like this

2023.12 --> 2033.84
this not like this

2045.76 --> 2052.48
yeah john jacob that's very nice hey i

2049.2 --> 2052.48
killed the hope long time no see

2056.399 --> 2061.839
yeah but you all know the moon rotates

2060.399 --> 2064.6389999999997
like this and this

2061.839 --> 2065.679
never rotates like this no no that's the

2064.639 --> 2069.119
presupposed

2065.679 --> 2072.079
shadow yeah that supposedly

2069.119 --> 2072.639
seems to kind of go like that doesn't it

2072.079 --> 2076.079
but

2072.639 --> 2088.32
now i'm talking about rotation not some

2076.079 --> 2091.2000000000003
i don't know visibility issues

2088.32 --> 2093.3590000000004
behind the sun oh you didn't listen to

2091.2 --> 2094.72
my argument john jacob you didn't listen

2093.359 --> 2097.52
did you

2094.72 --> 2098.24
because again you know if there is

2097.52 --> 2102.4
something

2098.24 --> 2106.0
moving over a sphere

2102.4 --> 2108.079
a sphere right

2106.0 --> 2111.839
yeah guess what happens when something

2108.079 --> 2113.92
is right on the side of the sphere

2111.839 --> 2115.68
right and you're staring at it like this

2113.92 --> 2118.64
it's here it's going to move

2115.68 --> 2119.359
that way at a persistent angular speed

2118.64 --> 2122.56
because we're

2119.359 --> 2125.04
just for sick argue sake going to

2122.56 --> 2126.88
assume that this supposed rotation is

2125.04 --> 2129.68
going to be consistent everywhere

2126.88 --> 2131.119
right well if something is like that and

2129.68 --> 2131.9199999999996
it's going to rotate like this guess

2131.119 --> 2135.76
what

2131.92 --> 2139.359
the angular shift

2135.76 --> 2143.44
like this visually it's going to be very

2139.359 --> 2144.0
slow compared to when it's right in the

2143.44 --> 2146.32
middle part

2144.0 --> 2147.119
then it's going to have the maximum

2146.32 --> 2149.04
displacement

2147.119 --> 2150.88
yeah it doesn't show that i just told

2149.04 --> 2154.16
you you have the sun

2150.88 --> 2158.56
disk the apparent disk sunspot they move

2154.16 --> 2162.0789999999997
like this as if they were a plate

2158.56 --> 2162.7999999999997
behind the sun hole just for arguing

2162.079 --> 2164.96
sake

2162.8 --> 2167.3590000000004
moving just like that no no no they

2164.96 --> 2170.839
don't move like this

2167.359 --> 2173.839
so yeah you're wrong john jacob you're

2170.839 --> 2173.839
wrong

2180.64 --> 2186.8799999999997
no no i already saw that

2184.079 --> 2187.6800000000003
paula bible literalist showed me her own

2186.88 --> 2190.56
work

2187.68 --> 2193.04
definitely not cgi she showed

2190.56 --> 2195.2799999999997
time-lapsed footage

2193.04 --> 2196.56
and it's exactly like i described there

2195.28 --> 2199.6800000000003
is no

2196.56 --> 2202.72
apparent rotation

2199.68 --> 2206.3199999999997
there is a displacement with

2202.72 --> 2210.839
yeah with the same angular speed

2206.32 --> 2214.0
over the apparent sun disk a consistent

2210.839 --> 2217.2799999999997
non-altering angular speed that

2214.0 --> 2219.44
makes yeah a presumed geometry

2217.28 --> 2220.6400000000003
of something rotating around the sphere

2219.44 --> 2229.839
kind of hard to

2220.64 --> 2229.839
justify do you understand

2234.16 --> 2240.24
of the host well dude [ __ ] off you piece

2237.68 --> 2240.24
of [ __ ]

2241.76 --> 2245.119
i just told you i don't need to look it

2244.56 --> 2249.599
up i

2245.119 --> 2252.8
watched it i watched it live presented

2249.599 --> 2256.1600000000003
the hard work from paula bible literally

2252.8 --> 2259.3590000000004
who did a lot of sun gazing or not

2256.16 --> 2262.0
gazing some footage and research very

2259.359 --> 2265.2
well researched

2262.0 --> 2267.44
she takes it very seriously go and ask

2265.2 --> 2267.4399999999996
her

2268.839 --> 2275.359
right

2270.99 --> 2277.2799999999997
[Music]

2275.359 --> 2278.72
i just did a whole piece on this if

2277.28 --> 2282.2400000000002
you're gonna tell me well

2278.72 --> 2284.56
if i don't if the host is not gonna do

2282.24 --> 2285.68
it's not gonna presuppose every [ __ ]

2284.56 --> 2288.0
thing you said

2285.68 --> 2289.5989999999997
and gonna look up your machination

2288.0 --> 2292.96
declaration [ __ ]

2289.599 --> 2295.599
and not rely on my own experience the

2292.96 --> 2298.56
things that i've seen that i've studied

2295.599 --> 2299.3590000000004
and explained about very detailed just

2298.56 --> 2303.04
now

2299.359 --> 2306.4
then you can just get the [ __ ] out

2303.04 --> 2308.8
piss off if you're like that if you're

2306.4 --> 2310.96
just here to assert the freaking

2308.8 --> 2312.079
sun is a globe no matter what then you

2310.96 --> 2314.7200000000003
can just get the

2312.079 --> 2314.7200000000003
[ __ ] out

2321.04 --> 2327.359
not look at evidence no

2324.32 --> 2330.2400000000002
i know what i've seen

2327.359 --> 2331.52
and i i wouldn't even know how to find

2330.24 --> 2341.839
that [ __ ] back

2331.52 --> 2341.839
three years ago

2347.76 --> 2355.8390000000004
yeah what i thought i'm looking at

2351.44 --> 2355.839
youtube videos

2356.16 --> 2359.2799999999997
but everything i'm seeing so far is all

2358.4 --> 2364.4
cgi

2359.28 --> 2364.4
crap all of it

2364.72 --> 2369.839
it's blatantly obvious cgi

2370.64 --> 2374.96
there's no actual camera work here

2375.119 --> 2379.359
that's the first thing when i when i'm

2377.359 --> 2382.96
looking at sunspot motion

2379.359 --> 2386.3199999999997
all the youtube videos all show cgi crap

2382.96 --> 2389.44
all of it there is no actual

2386.32 --> 2389.44
video taken

2389.76 --> 2394.32
from earth in these videos that youtube

2393.2 --> 2398.64
is revealing to me

2394.32 --> 2403.44
so yeah thanks it's completely useless

2398.64 --> 2403.44
it's all indoctrination garbage

2404.24 --> 2408.24
like i'm serious i think nasa must have

2407.119 --> 2411.44
pumped like a

2408.24 --> 2414.64
billion dollars or more

2411.44 --> 2417.92
in just sponsoring people to make crappy

2414.64 --> 2419.359
really heliocentric enforcing videos

2417.92 --> 2421.839
with animations

2419.359 --> 2422.48
approved by them and just make like a

2421.839 --> 2425.04
hundred

2422.48 --> 2426.88
million of them on youtube just as

2425.04 --> 2429.92
filler so you can never find

2426.88 --> 2429.92
anything genuine

2431.119 --> 2435.28
yeah anyway i know the channel bible

2434.24 --> 2440.24
literalist i know

2435.28 --> 2440.2400000000002
she made it so i'm gonna look that up

2442.56 --> 2448.0
wanna know her channel let me see

2450.24 --> 2454.72
see if i can see some sun videos

2455.119 --> 2467.839
it's a long time ago though

2478.88 --> 2481.839
see

2485.2 --> 2491.2
maybe now i'm looking into really old

2488.96 --> 2491.2
work

2493.44 --> 2509.839
two years ago what is this sunny could

2495.44 --> 2509.839
this be the video

2518.64 --> 2525.2799999999997
yeah i think it is

2523.28 --> 2526.8
no no no it's not amateur although

2525.28 --> 2528.96
amateur footage

2526.8 --> 2531.119
of the sun if she says that it is indeed

2528.96 --> 2534.079
amateur footage

2531.119 --> 2537.839
i i will trust her on that because she

2534.079 --> 2537.8390000000004
definitely knows how to distinguish

2541.68 --> 2544.0
right

2545.599 --> 2550.96
right she analyzes a video from my solar

2549.359 --> 2555.2799999999997
system channel

2550.96 --> 2555.28
sun through amateur solar telescope

2556.8 --> 2563.6800000000003
that was from 22nd of january 2017.

2561.119 --> 2564.4
i don't know i'd have to ask her she'd

2563.68 --> 2566.96
probably

2564.4 --> 2570.2400000000002
know where to find it because she has a

2566.96 --> 2570.2400000000002
lot of videos okay so

2572.0 --> 2578.079
i don't know if this specific video has

2575.68 --> 2580.48
no it it doesn't i don't know maybe it

2578.079 --> 2582.7200000000003
was on the previous channel or something

2580.48 --> 2586.0
but she's she's bound to still have the

2582.72 --> 2586.0
works on her computer

2591.119 --> 2594.48
no i even commented that

2601.599 --> 2605.2000000000003
right anyway this is the video

2605.76 --> 2609.44
that i found when looking

2611.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
on by the literalist channel

2635.76 --> 2641.599
ah i think the two ballers have pissed

2639.119 --> 2641.599
off now

2646.839 --> 2649.839
good

2652.16 --> 2656.72
okay what have you been blabbering about

2653.92 --> 2656.7200000000003
in the meantime

2661.119 --> 2668.96
so maybe other footage is the sun

2664.48 --> 2668.96
spot blacks what this is

2670.079 --> 2675.119
look tiny bumble look whatever the

2673.119 --> 2678.2400000000002
apparitions may be like you know

2675.119 --> 2681.359
they may be the most amazing insane

2678.24 --> 2684.24
deep unlimited fractal nature

2681.359 --> 2685.7599999999998
thingies that we could ever spot out

2684.24 --> 2688.4799999999996
there you know

2685.76 --> 2690.0
whatever we're gonna find out new

2688.48 --> 2691.64
lensing thingies

2690.0 --> 2693.44
yeah the sun could be like this

2691.64 --> 2697.44
unbelievable divine

2693.44 --> 2699.92
fractal [ __ ] thing whatever one thing

2697.44 --> 2702.839
it's not though and that's physical

2699.92 --> 2705.599
there's still no proof it's physical

2702.839 --> 2708.4
so yeah even if

2705.599 --> 2709.92
it just seemed like oh it must be it

2708.4 --> 2711.52
must be about it must be about it must

2709.92 --> 2712.96
be about it must be a ball yeah yeah

2711.52 --> 2716.16
it's really nice but if it

2712.96 --> 2719.68
must be a ball it's still not a physical

2716.16 --> 2722.56
literal ball it just appears to be

2719.68 --> 2724.48
like that because the design wants to

2722.56 --> 2727.68
[ __ ] people up

2724.48 --> 2730.319
that look at the freaking skies too much

2727.68 --> 2731.2799999999997
and start to reason about it too much

2730.319 --> 2734.24
makes them believe

2731.28 --> 2735.6800000000003
everything is balls they might get this

2734.24 --> 2737.7599999999998
crazy idea in the head that they're

2735.68 --> 2740.64
living on a ball

2737.76 --> 2741.44
right and then ball comes looking for

2740.64 --> 2747.839
them

2741.44 --> 2747.839
huh huh yeah

2753.2 --> 2757.4399999999996
yeah there's no distance to the sun none

2755.359 --> 2759.359
whatsoever no proof there is a distance

2757.44 --> 2761.2000000000003
no proof it's a physical object no proof

2759.359 --> 2764.4
you can approach it

2761.2 --> 2768.0
no angular size change with

2764.4 --> 2768.0
position change at all

2769.44 --> 2774.0
there is no angular size change over the

2772.079 --> 2777.2000000000003
course of the day

2774.0 --> 2779.839
only weird angular size and

2777.2 --> 2782.0
other weird yeah apparition related

2779.839 --> 2783.92
phenomena when it approaches the horizon

2782.0 --> 2787.119
in certain cases

2783.92 --> 2789.839
but yeah the actual angular speed never

2787.119 --> 2789.839
changes

2790.319 --> 2794.56
because it's not a physical thing it's

2792.319 --> 2796.88
an optical phenomena inherent to the

2794.56 --> 2796.88
realm

2797.2 --> 2800.7999999999997
light manifest a lot of it just like

2800.4 --> 2804.079
that

2800.8 --> 2807.76
out of nothing not coming from an object

2804.079 --> 2810.8
light manifest it just it's just there

2807.76 --> 2811.76
just manifesting being creative out of

2810.8 --> 2814.88
nothing

2811.76 --> 2815.599
light a lot of it so much you feel it

2814.88 --> 2817.92
constantly

2815.599 --> 2819.52
guess what it's coming from nothing it's

2817.92 --> 2822.4
not coming from a thing

2819.52 --> 2823.92
it's just light manifesting a lot of it

2822.4 --> 2826.7200000000003
can be obstructed

2823.92 --> 2828.48
it can be not obstructed but it's not

2826.72 --> 2831.1189999999997
coming from a thing it's just

2828.48 --> 2832.8
a lot of light it manifests it's not

2831.119 --> 2835.119
coming from a thing

2832.8 --> 2836.2400000000002
you have no proof it is it's just this

2835.119 --> 2838.4
apparent

2836.24 --> 2840.0
very bright disc thing you see at the

2838.4 --> 2843.119
epicenter of the

2840.0 --> 2845.68
lights direction sunlight's direction i

2843.119 --> 2847.44
called it the daylight direction

2845.68 --> 2849.2799999999997
but you know now that we've gone through

2847.44 --> 2851.119
the whole bible issue i think i need to

2849.28 --> 2852.8
be more specific with that because yeah

2851.119 --> 2855.44
the sunlight and the daylight are not

2852.8 --> 2855.44
the same thing

2855.76 --> 2862.559
so the sunlight

2859.2 --> 2865.2799999999997
is a thing but

2862.559 --> 2867.2000000000003
it's like a luminary it's not a physical

2865.28 --> 2870.88
object

2867.2 --> 2874.16
and it's not causing the daylight either

2870.88 --> 2876.1600000000003
it just rules over it so

2874.16 --> 2877.2799999999997
sunlight is a thing it's just not an

2876.16 --> 2881.92
object

2877.28 --> 2885.119
not object light phenomena luminary

2881.92 --> 2886.079
not an object it's not coming from a

2885.119 --> 2888.319
thing

2886.079 --> 2890.1600000000003
it's not like a lamp hanging up there

2888.319 --> 2892.64
something it's not shining

2890.16 --> 2893.839
through anything it's just light

2892.64 --> 2897.2
manifest when you go

2893.839 --> 2900.0
get too close it just vanishes

2897.2 --> 2902.0789999999997
it doesn't manifest anymore at a certain

2900.0 --> 2905.44
point

2902.079 --> 2908.96
what causes daylight god god

2905.44 --> 2910.36
causes daylight you got it it's

2908.96 --> 2912.16
the electrifying of

2910.36 --> 2914.8
[Music]

2912.16 --> 2915.44
the realm it's the best explanation i

2914.8 --> 2918.96
got

2915.44 --> 2921.76
it's god power god infused his personal

2918.96 --> 2925.28
shine into the realm a permanent basis

2921.76 --> 2925.28
divided in the day and the night

2925.68 --> 2928.7999999999997
and then he took some more of the light

2927.359 --> 2931.839
essence

2928.8 --> 2934.559
of himself and yeah divided

2931.839 --> 2935.68
the luminaries up in the heavens the

2934.559 --> 2943.8390000000004
biggest one

2935.68 --> 2943.839
the sun the most brightest luminary

2947.359 --> 2951.359
no it's not magic it's god

2951.839 --> 2954.5589999999997
the creator

2955.68 --> 2959.04
and it's probably if you're going to go

2957.52 --> 2960.8
a physics route it's probably

2959.04 --> 2965.68
electrically manifested

2960.8 --> 2968.079
because hey i have no examples of

2965.68 --> 2969.1189999999997
oh it's not true there's either chemical

2968.079 --> 2972.079
induced light

2969.119 --> 2973.28
that we can make or is electrical

2972.079 --> 2976.1600000000003
induced light well

2973.28 --> 2978.4
chemical reactions run out electricity

2976.16 --> 2981.839
can actually flow it

2978.4 --> 2986.4
you know as long as it keeps going

2981.839 --> 2988.7999999999997
it's easier to manifest

2986.4 --> 2990.079
light phenomena through electricity even

2988.8 --> 2992.319
remotely than it is

2990.079 --> 2993.44
through chemicals because chemical light

2992.319 --> 2997.599
is always

2993.44 --> 3000.7200000000003
directly on top of the chemical reaction

2997.599 --> 3002.559
right so yeah if there is daylight it's

3000.72 --> 3004.7999999999997
not coming from a physical object

3002.559 --> 3006.559
in a literal location it's just

3004.8 --> 3009.52
manifesting then i have no

3006.559 --> 3009.92
alternative conclusion but that it must

3009.52 --> 3012.4
be

3009.92 --> 3015.04
somehow induced by electricity the

3012.4 --> 3026.64
electrification of the realm

3015.04 --> 3030.0
so yeah that's it

3026.64 --> 3032.319
uh yeah

3030.0 --> 3034.0
but yeah what yeah that's nice like can

3032.319 --> 3035.44
be produced through sound and water but

3034.0 --> 3040.88
that's the thing

3035.44 --> 3043.28
can you make it move around as well

3040.88 --> 3045.2000000000003
uh thank you sean tibbetts for the 5

3043.28 --> 3046.8
pound super chat donation love our win

3045.2 --> 3048.48
love the creator i

3046.8 --> 3051.119
i wouldn't necessarily put those two

3048.48 --> 3051.119
things together

3051.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
but okay

3058.24 --> 3063.04
no i don't want to be a

3063.52 --> 3072.4
like an icon like that

3068.0 --> 3072.4
just trying to relay my insights

3073.119 --> 3078.0
and my good spirit that's all

3079.44 --> 3084.88
no stasmarats light is not

3081.359 --> 3084.88
electromagnetic radiation

3085.28 --> 3091.6800000000003
no it's not this is this is a fraud

3089.2 --> 3092.5589999999997
it's a fraud it's not true there's no

3091.68 --> 3097.52
proof it is

3092.559 --> 3100.8
light is not electricity

3097.52 --> 3102.4
light cannot be transferred into

3100.8 --> 3106.079
electricity

3102.4 --> 3109.44
without some kind of chemical

3106.079 --> 3112.0
related action like the

3109.44 --> 3112.0
what is it again

3113.74 --> 3124.0
[Applause]

3115.52 --> 3127.28
i forgot the name now

3124.0 --> 3129.52
photoelectric effect right you can't

3127.28 --> 3131.52
create electricity out of light without

3129.52 --> 3133.52
a photoelectric effect

3131.52 --> 3134.72
you can't create light out of

3133.52 --> 3138.0
electricity

3134.72 --> 3141.2799999999997
without a medium being electrified like

3138.0 --> 3144.88
metal right it's not

3141.28 --> 3147.599
the same thing this is a scientism

3144.88 --> 3150.0
myth there is no proof for it it's just

3147.599 --> 3152.88
like oh it correlates so much

3150.0 --> 3153.839
and since we are going to insist that

3152.88 --> 3156.7200000000003
it's all

3153.839 --> 3158.64
just a singular literal same thing we're

3156.72 --> 3159.359
just going to assume that electricity

3158.64 --> 3162.7999999999997
and light

3159.359 --> 3164.72
are one thing on a singular spectrum

3162.8 --> 3166.8
well guess what it's pseudoscience

3164.72 --> 3168.0
there's no proof correlation is not

3166.8 --> 3170.6400000000003
causation

3168.0 --> 3172.16
the reasons i just explained is why

3170.64 --> 3174.319
that's wrong

3172.16 --> 3176.0789999999997
and i didn't look this up i did not get

3174.319 --> 3178.64
this from qe

3176.079 --> 3179.599
it's just wrong there's no proof for

3178.64 --> 3182.5589999999997
this

3179.599 --> 3184.4
it's just a false scientism assumption

3182.559 --> 3187.76
and it probably has to do

3184.4 --> 3188.079
with some necessity for that to be like

3187.76 --> 3191.0400000000004
that

3188.079 --> 3192.2400000000002
in order for them to reify einsteinian

3191.04 --> 3193.7599999999998
modeling nonsense

3192.24 --> 3195.4399999999996
that's probably the reason why they did

3193.76 --> 3198.1600000000003
that in the first place

3195.44 --> 3201.119
now it's usually reification that causes

3198.16 --> 3204.24
this scientism over generalization

3201.119 --> 3206.88
it's just wrong light

3204.24 --> 3208.0
is not electricity electricity is not

3206.88 --> 3209.92
light they're not the same

3208.0 --> 3212.16
thing on the singular spectrum they're

3209.92 --> 3212.16
not

3213.28 --> 3217.0400000000004
you can't transform one into the other

3216.0 --> 3220.0
you can't shine

3217.04 --> 3220.5589999999997
light through a complex set of lenses

3220.0 --> 3223.76
and then

3220.559 --> 3226.48
end up with a beam of electricity

3223.76 --> 3229.28
that doesn't exist and not the other way

3226.48 --> 3229.28
around either

3230.0 --> 3234.079
you know you can conduct electricity and

3232.319 --> 3235.2
then you can cause electricity to

3234.079 --> 3236.88
basically

3235.2 --> 3239.5989999999997
i don't know this is a bad description

3236.88 --> 3241.76
but pile up in a piece of metal

3239.599 --> 3244.7200000000003
and then the metal will get electrified

3241.76 --> 3248.96
and then it will start to radiate light

3244.72 --> 3252.5589999999997
well guess what the matter

3248.96 --> 3256.4
being electrified causes the light

3252.559 --> 3259.6800000000003
the electricity is not gonna cause

3256.4 --> 3265.44
light without matter

3259.68 --> 3268.16
do you understand

3265.44 --> 3268.88
nobody said oh yeah they did say that oh

3268.16 --> 3272.0789999999997
yeah yeah

3268.88 --> 3274.0
starting to backtrack now are we sounds

3272.079 --> 3276.559
very familiar

3274.0 --> 3277.28
is this kosho or something he does that

3276.559 --> 3279.44
all the time

3277.28 --> 3280.3190000000004
no no you did say it's the same thing

3279.44 --> 3282.559
it's

3280.319 --> 3283.68
electricity light on the same spectrum

3282.559 --> 3286.4
it's wrong

3283.68 --> 3288.0789999999997
it's not the same thing if it's on the

3286.4 --> 3288.7200000000003
same thing that means that you could

3288.079 --> 3291.119
literally

3288.72 --> 3292.72
crunch something you know as you can

3291.119 --> 3295.599
like alter a light

3292.72 --> 3296.319
from just white to like brown or

3295.599 --> 3298.559
something

3296.319 --> 3300.319
yeah you filter a [ __ ] you break it you

3298.559 --> 3301.0400000000004
go back to whatever that's supposed to

3300.319 --> 3303.839
be

3301.04 --> 3304.88
yeah yeah you can't do that with

3303.839 --> 3306.96
electricity

3304.88 --> 3309.359
and then turn it into light or the other

3306.96 --> 3312.559
way around it requires

3309.359 --> 3315.7599999999998
very specific material

3312.559 --> 3316.799
interaction for one to be turned into

3315.76 --> 3319.5200000000004
the other

3316.799 --> 3321.28
do you understand it's not on the same

3319.52 --> 3325.599
spectrum

3321.28 --> 3325.599
this is a myth it's a scientist a myth

3333.68 --> 3338.3999999999996
yeah yeah sound into light look that's

3336.799 --> 3341.04
very fascinating but it is

3338.4 --> 3341.599
always a local phenomena because guess

3341.04 --> 3346.079
what

3341.599 --> 3349.52
sound is also secondary sound is again

3346.079 --> 3352.559
certain vibrations within matter

3349.52 --> 3356.24
and those vibrations then may cause them

3352.559 --> 3359.119
yeah cause yeah tension vacuum

3356.24 --> 3360.72
and that local light still requires the

3359.119 --> 3362.48
matter though

3360.72 --> 3364.64
and it is always it's only been

3362.48 --> 3368.0
demonstrated as a local phenomenon so

3364.64 --> 3369.2
no matter what the sun is not that star

3368.0 --> 3374.319
in a jar

3369.2 --> 3374.319
because it's a local phenomena you

3374.839 --> 3379.839
understand

3376.48 --> 3379.839
it is very interesting though

3380.4 --> 3387.839
does light need a medium yes matter

3383.839 --> 3387.839
the medium for light is matter

3389.76 --> 3393.92
it comes into being through matter it

3392.96 --> 3397.119
transfers

3393.92 --> 3400.0
through matter and it is absorbed

3397.119 --> 3400.799
transformed into something else with

3400.0 --> 3404.079
matter

3400.799 --> 3406.64
the medium for light is matter you

3404.079 --> 3406.6400000000003
understand

3409.359 --> 3412.88
hey or the lack thereof you know it's

3411.359 --> 3416.24
not the

3412.88 --> 3418.2400000000002
usually yeah it it glides through it

3416.24 --> 3420.9599999999996
easier if there's less matter it's as

3418.24 --> 3420.9599999999996
simple as that

3421.44 --> 3425.28
and one hour is just not enough

3425.359 --> 3433.92
okay amanda young sorry

3432.24 --> 3436.16
but yeah i am gonna round out the show

3433.92 --> 3437.6800000000003
soon it's been good though

3436.16 --> 3439.7599999999998
thank you for the five dollar super chat

3437.68 --> 3443.68
donation honey

3439.76 --> 3448.1600000000003
it's nice and the hashtag me

3443.68 --> 3449.1189999999997
of course right so yeah i'm gonna run

3448.16 --> 3452.16
out the show

3449.119 --> 3454.48
to join the flat earth debates so

3452.16 --> 3455.68
thanks everyone for coming it's been an

3454.48 --> 3457.68
interesting show

3455.68 --> 3459.9199999999996
lots of flat earth and physics i like

3457.68 --> 3461.7599999999998
that it's good to go through that a lot

3459.92 --> 3464.079
of the times

3461.76 --> 3464.079
and

3464.799 --> 3468.079
yeah if you like the show then please

3467.52 --> 3470.799
don't

3468.079 --> 3471.6800000000003
forget to rogan's it up and if you

3478.24 --> 3481.52
day and please

3479.28 --> 3483.2000000000003
also do support me through the paypal

3481.52 --> 3484.64
patreon the super chat and the

3483.2 --> 3488.16
membership system

3484.64 --> 3490.16
join button that'll be much appreciated

3488.16 --> 3493.04
uh i'll be back tomorrow flattered early

3490.16 --> 3494.319
bird number 634

3493.04 --> 3496.64
and i'm going to join the flight of the

3494.319 --> 3499.2799999999997
beach right after this hashtag mifa

3496.64 --> 3499.2799999999997
indeed

3499.92 --> 3504.559
michael rock of course amanda young over

3502.16 --> 3504.5589999999997
moko

3505.119 --> 3517.839
what is this okay purple rockstar what

3507.76 --> 3517.8390000000004
does that hashtag stand for

3520.319 --> 3524.319
yeah can you answer that please

3524.559 --> 3528.3190000000004
because if that is what i think it is

3528.4 --> 3532.319
it's going to be a goodbye for you again

3539.52 --> 3545.839
yeah thought so [ __ ] [ __ ]

3546.4 --> 3552.64
all right so until the next video

3549.52 --> 3554.96
keep it flat flat

3552.64 --> 3556.64
