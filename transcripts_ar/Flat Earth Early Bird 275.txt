went out in my t-shirt and was perfectly

87.63 --> 95.1
fine did get caught up in a little ring

90.929 --> 99.209
here and there but it's just a lot

95.1 --> 102.08999999999999
warmer than it looks it's weird and I

99.209 --> 105.599
think a lot of people are limits its

102.09 --> 111.269
judging it or maybe I am just heated up

105.599 --> 116.129
somehow I don't know what it is maybe

111.269 --> 119.25
our winds just cooking but yeah I still

116.129 --> 122.64
like it it looks like it the autumn has

119.25 --> 129.66

it does see me he said I haven't I'm

192.02 --> 197.27
having a little bit more trouble

193.79 --> 202.94
breathing than normal but yeah it could

197.27 --> 205.34
be but it doesn't feel like really like

202.94 --> 214.51
when everything gets sticky type of

205.34 --> 222.83
moisten so anyway hello Jason mcCormick

214.51 --> 227.63
Steve so yeah I'm having a pretty heavy

222.83 --> 232.01000000000002
day this morning I finally got a call

227.63 --> 234.01999999999998
from from my healer it's been weeks it's

232.01 --> 237.10999999999999
been extremely busy with all kinds of

234.02 --> 239.39000000000001
stuff it just didn't have the time and

237.11 --> 241.43
it was really necessary and he actually

239.39 --> 245.45
entertained over an hour conversation

241.43 --> 248.03
and that's very generous of him but it

245.45 --> 250.60999999999999
was necessary because there was a lot on

248.03 --> 253.64000000000001
my heart what's going on I pretty pretty

250.61 --> 256.31
much laid out the entire thing about

253.64 --> 259.01
what's going on here thinks my fears

256.31 --> 262.28000000000003
about certain yeah about what's

259.01 --> 266.15
happening in the corruption and the on a

262.28 --> 271.25
personal level and he just totally

266.15 --> 275.87
agreed with me like outright even even

271.25 --> 276.62
helped he gave his own examples and fit

275.87 --> 284.84000000000003
right in

276.62 --> 288.29
I also laid out my own issues where I

284.84 --> 292.42999999999995
get like the pressure of the entire

288.29 --> 294.32
situation and I'm not saying that there

292.43 --> 297.38
is no joy to be found in my life because

294.32 --> 299.15
there absolutely is I'm not gonna poopoo

297.38 --> 302.45
that but when the pressure goes high and

299.15 --> 306.56
I I lose a little side of that or I get

302.45 --> 308.3
anxious about financial issues then the

306.56 --> 310.91
beauty kind of goes away and it really

308.3 --> 314.03000000000003
feels every time when I get there like

310.91 --> 316.70000000000005
the entire world has been demonically

314.03 --> 319.03999999999996
rearranged in order for me to just not

316.7 --> 321.62
be able to escape the situation where I

319.04 --> 322.49
am like anything I would do only would

321.62 --> 327.23
make it

322.49 --> 329.90000000000003
and that's a very pessimist view on that

327.23 --> 331.13
and the funny thing is is that when I

329.9 --> 334.54999999999995
feel fine

331.13 --> 337.25
I often explain the same thing but from

334.55 --> 344.93
an optimistic point of view where I

337.25 --> 348.46
actually say like look I am just I'm too

344.93 --> 351.35
eager I want too much too fast

348.46 --> 355.33
constantly and it's never really

351.35 --> 359.08000000000004
effective when I unleash that it's like

355.33 --> 363.07
don't act when there's desperation

359.08 --> 366.44
motivating you because then it'll just

363.07 --> 369.74
disrupt the whole building process you

366.44 --> 371.99
are supposed to be engaging in and and

369.74 --> 374.12
that's just extremely sensible from a

371.99 --> 377.69
very sensible standpoint and I just have

374.12 --> 380.54
to deal with what I've become what I've

377.69 --> 384.44
allowed myself to become how I chose

380.54 --> 388.16
myself to to arrange my personality

384.44 --> 389.81
uphold certain things and then just see

388.16 --> 392.42
what I can do with the remaining

389.81 --> 394.58
maneuvering space and I've taken up a

392.42 --> 397.31
very high step on the ladder as it were

394.58 --> 402.56
at it and has a lot of consequences and

397.31 --> 407.9
very little maneuvering ability but it's

402.56 --> 410.21
not useless as I said because of doing

407.9 --> 414.03999999999996
this I do get packages and I'm just

410.21 --> 416.71999999999997
constantly hoping for more of these

414.04 --> 418.64000000000004
great insights because that seems to be

416.72 --> 420.32000000000005
the biggest reward I regarded as the

418.64 --> 423.53
biggest reward I don't know maybe some

420.32 --> 427.28
of you guys just think it's like oh

423.53 --> 430.09999999999997
really is that special well that's

427.28 --> 432.08
really nice but overall it's not really

430.1 --> 434.63
enough maybe there's people out there

432.08 --> 437.96
that think that way I hope my followers

434.63 --> 443.63
don't think that way I sometimes do

437.96 --> 445.63899999999995
again yeah I always get tend to be very

443.63 --> 451.25
punishing towards myself

445.639 --> 453.83
in the bottom line and I don't know but

451.25 --> 457.3
the thing that I might be Wanna talking

453.83 --> 462.349
about might be might need to talk about

457.3 --> 464.99
it's kind of personal is because I think

462.349 --> 466.969
that it could be useful maybe that's all

464.99 --> 470.409
part of why I'm here also and being as

466.969 --> 474.979
honest and open as I am and that is a

470.409 --> 477.71
lot of the punishment that I perceive

474.979 --> 479.06
that I feel like how I reflect the

477.71 --> 483.34
things happening to me

479.06 --> 486.229
is because of what I did in the past

483.34 --> 488.62899999999996
because things that I experienced in the

486.229 --> 496.27
past and that I did and thought haunt me

488.629 --> 504.529
and that's my consciousness I guess that

496.27 --> 506.50899999999996
in my brazenness I did violate and the

504.529 --> 509.99
stupid thing is was that I tried to

506.509 --> 513.32
rationalize it with yeah whatever the

509.99 --> 516.979
average person doesn't even see that and

513.32 --> 519.9190000000001
that was my justification I normalized

516.979 --> 527.9200000000001
myself with the average and allowed

519.919 --> 532.31
myself to just break that that very fine

527.92 --> 533.3
that very fine line and thought I could

532.31 --> 537.2299999999999
get away with it

533.3 --> 539.5999999999999
and they couldn't even though the

537.23 --> 542.12
penalties were technically mild the

539.6 --> 544.01
consequences have been echoing on to

542.12 --> 546.38
this day and if this is very

544.01 --> 549.98
specifically due to my sensitivity

546.38 --> 553.279
because if you're sensitive then the

549.98 --> 556.899
path becomes even more narrow and more

553.279 --> 563.99
dangerous pitfalls become more violent

556.899 --> 568.91
and I at some point as I said I I kind

563.99 --> 571.77
of was convinced drawn into and just

568.91 --> 574.65
deluded into saying like yeah I am

571.77 --> 577.8199999999999
I'm a Satanist I thought I was that I

574.65 --> 580.02
even said it to my freakin family and

577.82 --> 584.19
thinking about it just gives me the

580.02 --> 586.9499999999999
shivers that I did that but I was kind

584.19 --> 590.1300000000001
of serious about it and I I can't

586.95 --> 592.47
withhold that I have to confess I have

590.13 --> 594.6899999999999
to confess that I was very serious and I

592.47 --> 598.86
really kind of knew about the New World

594.69 --> 603.98
Order but I thought I was trying to like

598.86 --> 607.35
a cult branch I wanted to kind of like

603.98 --> 609.36
let's just rough it then this is yeah a

607.35 --> 611.07
megalomaniacal kind of point of view

609.36 --> 613.02
this is a dark point of view about what

611.07 --> 615.33
I thought was and I think there's been

613.02 --> 619.29
many people that's even have engaged in

615.33 --> 623.2800000000001
this like yeah I kind of like want to

619.29 --> 628.14
use the system to change things and

623.28 --> 630.15
repair [ __ ] and then still kind of like

628.14 --> 634.41
have sort of balance with the dark

630.15 --> 638.61
that's what I thought it's even kind of

634.41 --> 641.88
integrated in the very symbol of the two

638.61 --> 643.59
pentagrams which it also is the dark and

641.88 --> 648.71
the light in the balance that was kind

643.59 --> 652.89
of the thing but I just totally

648.71 --> 657.98
underestimated the soullessness and the

652.89 --> 657.98
senselessness of the darkness I

659.42 --> 667.17
underestimated it like Saruman

663.83 --> 670.35
underestimated Sauron thought he could

667.17 --> 674.0899999999999
handle certain things but as the movie

670.35 --> 680.6
and the books say over time he just

674.09 --> 685.2
became he just joined with him and I

680.6 --> 687.96
experienced that slightly but the weird

685.2 --> 690.0300000000001
thing was and this is because of my

687.96 --> 692.58
sensitivity and maybe these are like

690.03 --> 695.01
spirits on the other side that are

692.58 --> 698.25
entangled with my family bloodline I

695.01 --> 701.52
think my mother has been has had

698.25 --> 704.819
interactions with them as well that the

701.52 --> 707.939
moment I would unknowingly

704.819 --> 710.3689999999999
let myself slip into something very very

707.939 --> 713.8389999999999
dangerous like mortally dangerous that

710.369 --> 716.9100000000001
would totally break my everything then

713.839 --> 720.7990000000001
it's almost like another dimension opens

716.91 --> 726.539
up like a lights just it's incredible

720.799 --> 731.269
and I would like get slapped in the face

726.539 --> 736.47
by an extra dimensional entity and then

731.269 --> 739.499
in a shock pretty much walk away or like

736.47 --> 741.179
not do that and I can't even be too

739.499 --> 743.879
specific because it happened many times

741.179 --> 746.879
and I would even try to explain it to

743.879 --> 750.6
the dark ones to those those idiots

746.879 --> 752.22
those freaks that I dealt with they just

750.6 --> 757.289
didn't get it they just thought I was

752.22 --> 760.619
insane but I could not be dragged deeper

757.289 --> 763.289
into the dark at some point because as I

760.619 --> 766.679
was there in the process of doing all

763.289 --> 768.869
these things I lost track I lost track

766.679 --> 771.809
of what was real and that is also part

768.869 --> 775.1
of what happens in the darkness but my

771.809 --> 778.319
sub consciousness still guided me and

775.1 --> 782.8190000000001
still prevented me from walking too deep

778.319 --> 788.939
into just sickness but I still did quite

782.819 --> 794.149
a lot of superficial bad things and it

788.939 --> 799.8
still haunts me like

794.149 --> 802.98
telling people lies like from the the

799.8 --> 805.4699999999999
space idea from the philosophers I was

802.98 --> 809.91
into it all eugenics and all that [ __ ] I

805.47 --> 815.49
was kind of with that I was yeah that's

809.91 --> 817.769
I don't know I it that's part of what

815.49 --> 819.509
was there also what I've been exposed to

817.769 --> 821.88
and I kind of like thought like yeah

819.509 --> 824.5500000000001
there's kind of there's order to it

821.88 --> 831.269
that's what I thought and I misjudged

824.55 --> 834.269
that in retrospect I I'm completely

831.269 --> 839.13
losing track here what sins yeah what

834.269 --> 842.85
sins I would tell lies or basically pass

839.13 --> 848.67
on that vision that I had of this harsh

842.85 --> 851.37
order that was not like Oh Hitler that

848.67 --> 854.0999999999999
kind of nonsense but it was very much

851.37 --> 858.449
the liberal way but the problem was is I

854.1 --> 861.8100000000001
was very good at thinking it out and

858.449 --> 866.49
just saying it on the spot it's almost

861.81 --> 869.2199999999999
like a dark package it's weird that also

866.49 --> 872.189
did happen any retrospect I feel ashamed

869.22 --> 876.6890000000001
and I'm even surprised that I got the

872.189 --> 880.709
ability back because after I pretty much

876.689 --> 886.5889999999999
stumbled and dropped out and lost half

880.709 --> 889.8889999999999
my mind in the process I lost this I had

886.589 --> 891.6600000000001
no more higher car I was depressed and

889.889 --> 894.3290000000001
then you have no more higher contact and

891.66 --> 901.85
I never thought that I'd reach anything

894.329 --> 901.8499999999999
like that again because of what I did

908.21 --> 914.21
I don't know maybe this is just this

911.36 --> 919.07
sounds like total jibber-jabber to a lot

914.21 --> 921.88
of you it would be good to talk to with

919.07 --> 921.88
somebody about it

928.16 --> 931.66
it's just that

936.76 --> 941.38
and what I'm going through also I don't

939.37 --> 945.76
know what I also want to share this is

941.38 --> 948.1
because this is a natural mechanism I

945.76 --> 952.36
think this is really what the conscious

948.1 --> 954.6990000000001
does and the more you ascend the more

952.36 --> 959.38
you are confronted with your sins from

954.699 --> 962.29
the past then you have to fix them and I

959.38 --> 966.93
think that I have but there's still

962.29 --> 970.959
parts of it that just won't go away and

966.93 --> 974.4399999999999
when I go down the hill again in that

970.959 --> 977.199
swing of the pendulum they face me again

974.44 --> 980.5600000000001
it's like the nightmares come back and

977.199 --> 983.1099999999999
some of it is dark world nightmare

980.56 --> 985.959
torture with that's not real and

983.11 --> 988.9300000000001
sometimes it's just reminding myself

985.959 --> 991.0889999999999
yeah I I was there I thought I was

988.93 --> 993.76
really cool and I said these nasty

991.089 --> 997.1700000000001
things that just took the hope away from

993.76 --> 997.17
people it was so wrong

1000.48 --> 1003.649
[Music]

1005.189 --> 1013.24
even though it's like

1010.82 --> 1018.37
eighteen years ago something like that

1013.24 --> 1025.52
it was really in those first five years

1018.37 --> 1030.74
between 1990 98 and 2003 that's though

1025.52 --> 1032.3899999999999
that was the worst time that's also the

1030.74 --> 1034.91
time that has just drowned in black

1032.39 --> 1037.64
methyl and [ __ ] I was literally just on

1034.91 --> 1040.6100000000001
this deluded bat the walk into the

1037.64 --> 1043.5200000000002
darkness and figured I'd be some kind of

1040.61 --> 1047.24
mage you know I didn't have any

1043.52 --> 1053.29
objections I didn't believe in the Bible

1047.24 --> 1060.56
I thought God was real and I thought I

1053.29 --> 1063.05
had an agreement so it's but I was very

1060.56 --> 1068.51
young and I was drowning in my own

1063.05 --> 1075.32
energies I was literally high on my own

1068.51 --> 1078.44
feelings a lot of the time and feelings

1075.32 --> 1082.81
out alter the way you see things

1078.44 --> 1089.6200000000001
drop away and other things become

1082.81 --> 1090.98
irrationally important all right yeah I

1089.62 --> 1093.77
heard

1090.98 --> 1097.85
Lona inna it's also sad news about

1093.77 --> 1099.56
sheeps and Eve's I didn't really know

1097.85 --> 1101.6299999999999
the guy all that well what's just never

1099.56 --> 1104.11
good to hear something like that

1101.63 --> 1104.1100000000001
happening

1104.67 --> 1107.759
[Music]

1119.2 --> 1126.46
oh and by the way maybe on a lighter

1123.52 --> 1130.83
note what's also very heavy is the

1126.46 --> 1134.47
combination of oh my healer basically

1130.83 --> 1143.3999999999999
fixing me up and getting some nasty

1134.47 --> 1148.66
entities away and me yeah having a

1143.4 --> 1152.64
sticky smile a small joke since a long

1148.66 --> 1155.5600000000002
time which I finally had a small yeah a

1152.64 --> 1158.38
little bit but that just really hit hard

1155.56 --> 1163.33
because I have barely said and I haven't

1158.38 --> 1165.3100000000002
smoked in in a while since since

1163.33 --> 1167.74
yesterday so that hit pretty hard as

1165.31 --> 1169.24
well a combination with the with

1167.74 --> 1174.79
everything worth my energies just

1169.24 --> 1182.6200000000001
flowing more naturally I just that's

1174.79 --> 1186.99
heavy stuff anyway yeah Lona inna has a

1182.62 --> 1190.78
link there so apparently there's a

1186.99 --> 1193.39
funeral fund and well the link is there

1190.78 --> 1197.23
so if anybody wants to help out then

1193.39 --> 1199.47
click the link and help help out if you

1197.23 --> 1199.47
can

1203.05 --> 1211.33
ha that's funny saucy London because my

1208.63 --> 1216.4
healer helps out all kinds of people

1211.33 --> 1220.51
including people that I mentioned that

1216.4 --> 1226.0300000000002
some of you may know and the weird thing

1220.51 --> 1229.33
is there is there is like there are

1226.03 --> 1232.81
contracts again this is it ethereal

1229.33 --> 1235.8999999999999
stuff but some people may not be healed

1232.81 --> 1238.06
because they have voluntarily engaged in

1235.9 --> 1242.47
a contract with an entity they chose it

1238.06 --> 1244.6299999999999
and then you can't take away the side

1242.47 --> 1248.65
effects as a healer because if you do

1244.63 --> 1252.7600000000002
then you break the contract it's and

1248.65 --> 1255.5800000000002
that that was new to me that my healer

1252.76 --> 1257.8
told me this that was new to me because

1255.58 --> 1262.03
I've learned how to magnetize and heal

1257.8 --> 1268.81
since I was 18 and I was - I would just

1262.03 --> 1271.72
do whoever and I did I took all kinds of

1268.81 --> 1274.02
weird karma that wasn't mine with me as

1271.72 --> 1274.02
well

1274.5 --> 1279.07
healer client confidentiality well I'm

1277.18 --> 1282.49
never gonna mention his name if that's

1279.07 --> 1286.24
what you're thinking but he has no

1282.49 --> 1288.97
objections to me mentioning that I have

1286.24 --> 1291.94
a healer and pass on some of it advice

1288.97 --> 1296.1100000000001
especially if if it's concerning Rudolf

1291.94 --> 1300.9
Steiners teachings which he thinks the

1296.11 --> 1304.03
world sorely misses and I agree with him

1300.9 --> 1306.22
so he has an I fast him and he gave me

1304.03 --> 1309.21
permission to talk about him as long as

1306.22 --> 1309.21
I just don't mention his name

1312.22 --> 1324.8500000000001
all right but yes I have helped some

1316.07 --> 1327.8
people but yeah sometimes some people

1324.85 --> 1329.6899999999998
they cannot be helped or they cannot be

1327.8 --> 1333.98
helped with the issue that they are

1329.69 --> 1336.53
dealing with at the time so but I do

1333.98 --> 1339.23
yeah I do have concerns about certain

1336.53 --> 1341.48
people at times and sometimes when I

1339.23 --> 1345.38
have him on the phone then I then I ask

1341.48 --> 1350.45
like hey this person what's going on did

1345.38 --> 1354.0200000000002
he need some help and sometimes yeah he

1350.45 --> 1357.8
has helped some some people that we know

1354.02 --> 1361.03
and I hope they they were yeah happy

1357.8 --> 1361.03
about it even though they didn't know

1366.98 --> 1371.93
and by the way they could not have not

1369.68 --> 1373.76
been happy about it maybe they're not

1371.93 --> 1376.73
happy about not knowing but they won't

1373.76 --> 1378.77
know who they are anyway but if they

1376.73 --> 1381.02
wouldn't have been happy about it being

1378.77 --> 1383.54
taken away then it wasn't it wouldn't

1381.02 --> 1386.2
have been allowed to be healed that's

1383.54 --> 1386.2
how it works

1391.15 --> 1398.3090000000002
yeah that that's basically what that

1394.03 --> 1398.309
comes down to start carbo

1411.22 --> 1423.07
hmm it's an interesting thing you just

1414.4 --> 1425.679
said there's sir Rita Cosentino that sin

1423.07 --> 1428.76
in the biblical meaning is missing the

1425.679 --> 1432.49
mark that's well that makes sense

1428.76 --> 1436.539
stay straying the path may see well what

1432.49 --> 1437.679
do you take it as a location or a line

1436.539 --> 1442.84
through our time

1437.679 --> 1450.99
yeah it's deviation and its inherent

1442.84 --> 1455.59
it's natural it is only mistakable if by

1450.99 --> 1459.539
confusion or delusion or intoxication or

1455.59 --> 1459.539
or willful ignorance

1469.1 --> 1477.83
yeah okay step tap yeah I don't know

1472.159 --> 1481.6390000000001
either look this guy is not a medium he

1477.83 --> 1484.34
doesn't do that he's a healer he does

1481.639 --> 1487.0089999999998
not allow anyone any spirit to enter him

1484.34 --> 1488.84
that's actually straight against the

1487.009 --> 1491.8700000000001
teacher there the whole thing is about

1488.84 --> 1497.23
earthing about being in your body being

1491.87 --> 1499.8799999999999
so that is one of the things about it

1497.23 --> 1502.159
about what could be objectionable about

1499.88 --> 1505.94
mediums is that they do have an opening

1502.159 --> 1510.3500000000001
and they allow other spirits not of

1505.94 --> 1512.929
their own into them and yeah that that's

1510.35 --> 1514.37
at least potentially a danger because

1512.929 --> 1515.99
they literally have a hole in them

1514.37 --> 1523.0089999999998
whether they have it under control or

1515.99 --> 1527.269
not and most have it under control I

1523.009 --> 1531.6390000000001
think but still

1527.269 --> 1531.639
yeah it's questionable to say the least

1532.629 --> 1540.639
and I have listened to some I have as I

1537.379 --> 1545.149
already shared I have talked to mediums

1540.639 --> 1548.4499999999998
it's been those experience have never

1545.149 --> 1552.559
felt like a sin to me but that's also

1548.45 --> 1555.769
because I was very careful because I do

1552.559 --> 1559.039
realize yes like this is not this is

1555.769 --> 1561.799
another entity and you got to be very

1559.039 --> 1564.94
fine sensing because they could

1561.799 --> 1569.269
potentially be incredibly smart and

1564.94 --> 1571.97
scheming throughout time without people

1569.269 --> 1573.95
noticing because they make it extremely

1571.97 --> 1576.2
difficult to notice if they would be

1573.95 --> 1579.769
doing that so if we just put out all

1576.2 --> 1585.529
senses hold up the shield and just very

1579.769 --> 1587.1490000000001
careful like yeah trying to poke at a

1585.529 --> 1589.82
snapping turtle you got to be extremely

1587.149 --> 1591.6789999999999
careful when you do that that's how I

1589.82 --> 1595.25
approach that but doesn't mean that you

1591.679 --> 1598.789
just can never never do that or oh my

1595.25 --> 1603.1
god they have to be has to be forbidden

1598.789 --> 1603.1
all right no no I don't agree to that

1603.529 --> 1614.279
but it is something yeah yeah you gotta

1607.47 --> 1619.409
be careful with that and the funny thing

1614.279 --> 1621.389
is is that I think that how the function

1619.409 --> 1625.8300000000002
of mediumship or it could be called

1621.389 --> 1630.119
channeling some some British groups

1625.83 --> 1632.509
called channeling that I think I get

1630.119 --> 1635.82
what it is because I can kind of do it

1632.509 --> 1641.6390000000001
but I would never draw in a another

1635.82 --> 1646.289
entity it's like my own spirit can do

1641.639 --> 1650.639
that it's like a switch and you just you

1646.289 --> 1654.809
get more raw data and you don't let it

1650.639 --> 1659.639
stick to your person yeah it's hard to

1654.809 --> 1662.549
describe so it is kind of a tool but I

1659.639 --> 1664.619
guess that some people as they apply

1662.549 --> 1667.98
this tool they need to compartmentalize

1664.619 --> 1670.7389999999998
themselves they literally you could also

1667.98 --> 1672.869
consider consider this I'm not saying it

1670.739 --> 1675.749
is like this but you could consider is

1672.869 --> 1678.529
that it's kind of a controlled multiple

1675.749 --> 1680.789
personality system where they literally

1678.529 --> 1683.58
compartmentalize themselves to protect

1680.789 --> 1685.999
aspects of what they might be confronted

1683.58 --> 1690.57
with as they are engaging in the process

1685.999 --> 1694.919
it could be considered like that but it

1690.57 --> 1699.6589999999999
could definitely also be real other

1694.919 --> 1701.8790000000001
entities I've never actually kind of

1699.659 --> 1703.6390000000001
crossed reference tested this maybe this

1701.879 --> 1707.4289999999999
is an interesting question for my either

1703.639 --> 1709.1689999999999
well like what what is this try to

1707.429 --> 1711.6000000000001
compare it to for example what I do

1709.169 --> 1713.6390000000001
because sometimes what I do just also

1711.6 --> 1716.279
feels like channeling I just open up my

1713.639 --> 1719.1
mind and things come rolling in and it

1716.279 --> 1721.109
just explained them I see it and I

1719.1 --> 1724.379
explained it how is that really

1721.109 --> 1726.899
different from channeling from being a

1724.379 --> 1729.869
medium except that that is kind of

1726.899 --> 1733.7199999999998
ritualized and then an alternative

1729.869 --> 1736.09
person takes the role

1733.72 --> 1741.55
it happens how is that really different

1736.09 --> 1744.57
I don't know it's it's something to tell

1741.55 --> 1744.57
to figure out

1744.8 --> 1747.97
[Music]

1750.83 --> 1755.9299999999998
yeah yeah that tapi I know exactly what

1755.45 --> 1758.9
you mean

1755.93 --> 1761.03
yeah cept a pious Dutch so we share the

1758.9 --> 1764.39
same kind of media things and everything

1761.03 --> 1767.93
and there's always this program on the

1764.39 --> 1771.2800000000002
yeah on a an early channel like a

1767.93 --> 1774.5
channel that's very early on the list

1771.28 --> 1779.24
and they always have like this medium

1774.5 --> 1782.66
that just is like a phone in me it just

1779.24 --> 1784.85
looks really cheap and I've watched that

1782.66 --> 1787.16
sometimes it's like one of those things

1784.85 --> 1789.4399999999998
back in the day when the internet wasn't

1787.16 --> 1792.16
as abundant as it was now especially

1789.44 --> 1794.72
it's been going on since the 90s that

1792.16 --> 1796.13
and sometimes like oh it's late you

1794.72 --> 1797.8700000000001
don't want to go to bed and you just

1796.13 --> 1801.2600000000002
flicking it's like oh this is going on

1797.87 --> 1806.4499999999998
and just see how silly it can get and it

1801.26 --> 1808.61
was so done it's it's just exactly a

1806.45 --> 1811.55
stereotype of dumbest you would think it

1808.61 --> 1816.32
would be so I know what you're talking

1811.55 --> 1822.68
about cept happy yeah there's not a lot

1816.32 --> 1827.54
of depth in it but I don't know I think

1822.68 --> 1831.5
that a lot of regular people have very

1827.54 --> 1836.18
regular concerns and they don't they

1831.5 --> 1837.92
don't really want any high questions on

1836.18 --> 1841.54
the highest consciousness scale

1837.92 --> 1845.99
attaining perfection and grip on a few

1841.54 --> 1848.6599999999999
they're just they don't get that so that

1845.99 --> 1851.54
thing is really for just a handful of

1848.66 --> 1854.3000000000002
people around the world most people are

1851.54 --> 1858.62
dissatisfied to get like a good tip like

1854.3 --> 1863.09
oh should I dress extra nice on this

1858.62 --> 1866.9899999999998
occasion or how is my deceased mother

1863.09 --> 1869.4499999999998
doing you know very basic stuff so yeah

1866.99 --> 1872.45
it is kind of dumb but there is a wide

1869.45 --> 1875.74
market for this because yeah that's

1872.45 --> 1875.74
unfortunate well unfortunately

1900.24 --> 1908.749
a Grammy hey take it or leave it it's up

1906.33 --> 1908.749
to you

1911.88 --> 1915.0990000000002
[Music]

1919.65 --> 1928.92
all right anyway look a good piece of

1926.28 --> 1931.8899999999999
advice is precious and whether that

1928.92 --> 1936.93
piece of advice comes from a medium or

1931.89 --> 1939.9
good friend or parents or who knows a

1936.93 --> 1944.22
teacher these days you know and not so

1939.9 --> 1948.48
much anymore I think on average but hey

1944.22 --> 1951.0
if the math if it helps it helps and if

1948.48 --> 1954.809
people like to go to mediums to get that

1951.0 --> 1956.88
help then well that's the way they do it

1954.809 --> 1960.6299999999999
I don't know I just don't have a problem

1956.88 --> 1963.41
with it in general I don't see it as

1960.63 --> 1963.41
dark magic

1983.78 --> 1988.57
no you don't Grammy 9:00

1994.58 --> 2000.52
but I usually only revoke wrenches if

1998.03 --> 2020.52
there are abused as specifically noted

2000.52 --> 2026.76
in rules yeah Sarita Cosentino I agree

2020.52 --> 2033.43
but you have to see what that means okay

2026.76 --> 2036.04
what it is is it is straying so let's

2033.43 --> 2040.0600000000002
just say if you want to read perfection

2036.04 --> 2042.9099999999999
then being a medium will not get you

2040.06 --> 2046.09
there but that doesn't mean that you

2042.91 --> 2051.7200000000003
can't ever use that at some point or

2046.09 --> 2051.72
learn about it or I don't know you know

2057.02 --> 2062.139
a familiar spirit is it

2067.49 --> 2074.33
all right well the thing is also there

2071.899 --> 2081.3199999999997
is that there is some relevance to this

2074.33 --> 2084.889
I think because as far as I know in

2081.32 --> 2088.07
general familiar or well you call them

2084.889 --> 2094.07
familiar spirits but mediums tend to not

2088.07 --> 2096.0800000000004
like Christians a lot and it isn't

2094.07 --> 2098.57
necessarily some kind of religious

2096.08 --> 2100.19
belief or devotion it's it can be just

2098.57 --> 2101.92
the basic allergy so there may be

2100.19 --> 2104.48
something to that

2101.92 --> 2109.9
it's not surprising that I've dealt with

2104.48 --> 2113.39
a lot because yeah I wasn't Gaussian and

2109.9 --> 2116.21
whicker's I would yeah I meet a lot of

2113.39 --> 2119.0
these people and let's just say the vast

2116.21 --> 2122.29
vast vast majority or almost a hundred

2119.0 --> 2125.29
percent was not Christian or

2122.29 --> 2125.29
anti-christian

2136.02 --> 2149.52
that's ridiculous you guys are so

2140.52 --> 2151.59
primitive the littleit I I just try to

2149.52 --> 2155.04
show you and you just didn't get it did

2151.59 --> 2159.9
you when something is said you have to

2155.04 --> 2162.15
see what it is they mean what is the

2159.9 --> 2166.05
actual action every time something is

2162.15 --> 2168.63
supposedly a sin or is a sin it's not a

2166.05 --> 2171.6000000000004
sin because it is said in the freaking

2168.63 --> 2175.11
book the book is only pointing at

2171.6 --> 2175.71
something that is there and if you don't

2175.11 --> 2178.7400000000002
get it

2175.71 --> 2182.55
then you don't get reality you don't see

2178.74 --> 2185.04
it what it is exactly pointing at that

2182.55 --> 2190.05
is the way you should be looking at the

2185.04 --> 2193.29
Bible it's not oh this is this quote is

2190.05 --> 2196.23
the truth because it is in the Bible no

2193.29 --> 2199.2799999999997
you have to understand what they're

2196.23 --> 2201.66
saying that's the whole point about it

2199.28 --> 2204.7200000000003
and if you don't do that then you're a

2201.66 --> 2208.0499999999997
dumbass or you're just not ready because

2204.72 --> 2214.1699999999996
you are in a hopefully temporarily

2208.05 --> 2217.46
Luciferian path like I was cuz I didn't

2214.17 --> 2217.46
get the Bible at all

2217.94 --> 2221.13
[Music]

2240.02 --> 2246.8
yeah the most woke God just saying that

2245.119 --> 2252.76
it's just a terrible thing to do

2246.8 --> 2252.76
fe fe Vader earth Vader

2260.48 --> 2270.41
yeah but look again Zep tepi look at

2264.53 --> 2274.4900000000002
what just because there is some kind of

2270.41 --> 2278.42
empire using a book as an occult

2274.49 --> 2281.1499999999996
blueprint for what they're doing does

2278.42 --> 2283.849
that mean that that is the only thing

2281.15 --> 2287.2400000000002
about it that is that that is what the

2283.849 --> 2291.7000000000003
function is or did they simply like a

2287.24 --> 2295.1189999999997
parasite latch onto a glorious thing and

2291.7 --> 2299.75
try to convert it and corrupt it and

2295.119 --> 2302.119
create a reality extracted from it just

2299.75 --> 2305.599
to fool everyone into believing that

2302.119 --> 2315.9100000000003
it's actually not a real thing have you

2305.599 --> 2315.9100000000003
ever considered that so which one is it

2357.47 --> 2362.1699999999996
it's corrupted now know why

2366.44 --> 2374.27
what is corrupted about it is it

2368.96 --> 2377.119
corrupted or are is the way that people

2374.27 --> 2381.64
are reading it and interpreting it and

2377.119 --> 2386.75
making choices based upon it corrupted

2381.64 --> 2391.7599999999998
because I think that the yeah almost all

2386.75 --> 2393.44
of it is still the same maybe some weird

2391.76 --> 2396.0490000000004
little detail changes and you could get

2393.44 --> 2399.5
all hyped up about that but I think it's

2396.049 --> 2401.359
mostly the same I think that what the

2399.5 --> 2405.789
controllers have been working on more

2401.359 --> 2408.5589999999997
than just rearranging the books is

2405.789 --> 2412.369
creating a new culture in order to

2408.559 --> 2415.3900000000003
interpret it and working on making it

2412.369 --> 2419.569
very flexible so they can literally

2415.39 --> 2428.21
construct pathways mentally for people

2419.569 --> 2430.579
to fall in line with so instead of

2428.21 --> 2432.799
corrupting the book they just invent a

2430.579 --> 2436.549
corrupted way of interpreting it and

2432.799 --> 2439.49
then they spread it out and they make it

2436.549 --> 2441.98
stick and then I Ram it through everyone

2439.49 --> 2444.47
and then they may upgrade it to another

2441.98 --> 2446.18
version that's even more corrupted and

2444.47 --> 2448.45
then they try to spread that and then

2446.18 --> 2452.5
they let all the difference corrupted

2448.45 --> 2452.5
interpretation fight with one another

2453.16 --> 2456.5789999999997
ever thought of that

2457.7 --> 2464.23
oh I'm gonna get some new tea by the way

2461.24 --> 2464.2299999999996
be right back

2524.069 --> 2526.099
ah

2526.73 --> 2530.05
[Music]

2532.829 --> 2539.0890000000004
Nathan's having a life panel I see 20

2536.789 --> 2539.0890000000004
minutes

2553.08 --> 2556.219
[Music]

2565.98 --> 2574.2400000000002
well delete delete' let me try to

2570.9 --> 2577.9
rearrange the approach of um how you're

2574.24 --> 2580.569
thinking about it right now okay and it

2577.9 --> 2583.059
deletes us it isn't it coincidental that

2580.569 --> 2586.869
all these Abrahamic religions work

2583.059 --> 2591.76
towards the same end times like a script

2586.869 --> 2597.369
well maybe it's simply describing a

2591.76 --> 2600.4900000000002
natural pattern of how things will

2597.369 --> 2603.75
manifest because not because it's

2600.49 --> 2609.8689999999997
predicted because it is inevitable

2603.75 --> 2612.88
because it just happens because of how

2609.869 --> 2615.579
everything has been designed it's the

2612.88 --> 2619.839
logical consequence almost like entropy

2615.579 --> 2622.059
itself it just happens and who knows

2619.839 --> 2624.7599999999998
maybe they just said okay end times this

2622.059 --> 2628.48
is where it ends and they like had an

2624.76 --> 2631.42
after story who knows maybe that part is

2628.48 --> 2636.069
not real that's kind of blasphemous to

2631.42 --> 2639.039
say but maybe that's just the way the

2636.069 --> 2640.079
entire piece is presented maybe it's

2639.039 --> 2644.529
cyclical

2640.079 --> 2648.76
maybe these the final apocalypse in this

2644.529 --> 2657.75
in the script as you say is just the

2648.76 --> 2657.75
beginning of something new so

2657.91 --> 2666.43
yeah there is so much value in

2662.2 --> 2667.7999999999997
everything that the Bible contains and

2666.43 --> 2671.89
that's just a fact

2667.8 --> 2674.9500000000003
and it doesn't matter if somebody wrote

2671.89 --> 2679.48
it I'm pretty sure that officially it's

2674.95 --> 2681.85
been written by people it's just that

2679.48 --> 2685.6
it's been written by very specifically

2681.85 --> 2689.02
inspired people and that specific

2685.6 --> 2691.0299999999997
inspiration can be found back within the

2689.02 --> 2694.98
very nature of the writing and the

2691.03 --> 2699.78
spirit that it carries the frequency

2694.98 --> 2699.78
that you are exposed to when you read it

2706.31 --> 2709.0299999999997
all right

2726.13 --> 2733.73
you know the little Israel look you did

2731.6 --> 2738.86
you just ignore what I said before all

2733.73 --> 2743.3
this how controllers literally infect

2738.86 --> 2746.33
something and extract something to then

2743.3 --> 2750.26
create with the round power and kind of

2746.33 --> 2754.1
fake things that are predicted they use

2750.26 --> 2756.8300000000004
great writings to to maneuver people

2754.1 --> 2764.06
into fooling that things are going on

2756.83 --> 2768.41
like that but why do you think that

2764.06 --> 2770.99
entire book that the giant the whole

2768.41 --> 2773.5099999999998
Bible and all it is actually about the

2770.99 --> 2776.2599999999998
freaking State of Israel they're over

2773.51 --> 2781.6400000000003
there why do you think it is about that

2776.26 --> 2784.4300000000003
it's Israel is almost like what if

2781.64 --> 2786.47
another religion had been at the root of

2784.43 --> 2788.24
it all and Israel wouldn't be called

2786.47 --> 2795.35
Israel but it would be called Mount

2788.24 --> 2797.2099999999996
Olympus okay think about it why are you

2795.35 --> 2799.46
then gonna be like oh my God all that

2797.21 --> 2801.7400000000002
Greek freakin mythology religion yeah

2799.46 --> 2804.62
the freaking controllers they wrote it

2801.74 --> 2809.87
specifically because of Mount Olympus

2804.62 --> 2813.5899999999997
right there that's what I'm seeing

2809.87 --> 2816.1099999999997
you're doing right here why would you

2813.59 --> 2818.69
say that something so ancient was

2816.11 --> 2820.78
specifically all written down for

2818.69 --> 2824.75
something that's going on right now

2820.78 --> 2830.32
that's obviously been stolen from

2824.75 --> 2830.32
antiquity is a cover name it's an act

2831.88 --> 2839.06
it's literally acting acting the part of

2835.91 --> 2846.5499999999997
it but that's a fake up that cannot be

2839.06 --> 2846.5499999999997
true because she can't act it

2851.599 --> 2858.98
yeah oh yeah yeah

2860.75 --> 2863.97
delete delete

2862.049 --> 2867.059
are you seriously just not listening to

2863.97 --> 2872.97
what I'm saying same stuff with Mount

2867.059 --> 2875.25
Olympus Empire power but that also means

2872.97 --> 2879.99
that it has nothing to do with the

2875.25 --> 2883.92
freakin book you gotta get this the book

2879.99 --> 2886.16
did not come into being for something

2883.92 --> 2889.109
that's happening right now right there

2886.16 --> 2893.1189999999997
to think that is dumb

2889.109 --> 2896.99
it's really short-sighted it's gullible

2893.119 --> 2896.9900000000002
you can't be serious

2906.11 --> 2911.0
that's right freedom minded Fe is

2908.82 --> 2913.28
exactly my point

2911.0 --> 2917.37
[Music]

2913.28 --> 2919.53
shouldn't be looking at names and titles

2917.37 --> 2924.35
and looks you should be looking at

2919.53 --> 2927.8700000000003
fruits a tax at deeds at atmosphere

2924.35 --> 2929.8199999999997
that's what's that's that's their real

2927.87 --> 2932.6099999999997
teller that's not that's not a mask

2929.82 --> 2935.42
that's real stop looking at the mask and

2932.61 --> 2935.42
look at what's real

2937.37 --> 2947.5099999999998
[Music]

2955.31 --> 2962.6
Kamikaze Gilmore well I think the veil

2958.71 --> 2965.67
is already being lifted I think that

2962.6 --> 2969.54
it's almost entirely lifted at this

2965.67 --> 2971.82
point but just because it is lifted

2969.54 --> 2975.12
doesn't mean that the people will not

2971.82 --> 2978.9
still be blinded by the confusion that

2975.12 --> 2982.98
was sown so even as the lift is valid

2978.9 --> 2985.56
even as satan takes off the mask there

2982.98 --> 2988.02
will still be people staring right into

2985.56 --> 2992.07
Satan's face telling themselves

2988.02 --> 2995.81
that's not Satan because what everything

2992.07 --> 3002.3900000000003
I learned says that that's not Satan

2995.81 --> 3005.6
that's unfortunately how works so even

3002.39 --> 3007.04
though the veil is being lifted that

3005.6 --> 3011.33
doesn't mean that everything is

3007.04 --> 3016.16
certainly gonna work out it's just

3011.33 --> 3021.5299999999997
finally there to see that's all doesn't

3016.16 --> 3026.1499999999996
mean it will go away that's for those

3021.53 --> 3028.57
that can see to choose to do something

3026.15 --> 3028.57
about it

3036.8 --> 3049.32
yes delete delete that's exactly what

3039.57 --> 3054.15
I'm saying the Bible describes how power

3049.32 --> 3057.2400000000002
corruption culmination will proceed

3054.15 --> 3060.39
what will naturally unfold and how and

3057.24 --> 3063.8399999999997
where it will lead to because it does

3060.39 --> 3066.48
that it may do it now sort of or

3063.84 --> 3068.94
partially it has done that in the past

3066.48 --> 3073.29
in other fashions but still very similar

3068.94 --> 3076.35
and it will do that many times to come

3073.29 --> 3078.63
in the future don't think that this is

3076.35 --> 3082.38
the last time that this kind of weirds

3078.63 --> 3086.57
dark take over attempt is gonna it's not

3082.38 --> 3086.57
the last time don't be a fool

3093.51 --> 3098.369
but may take a while you know that but

3096.72 --> 3101.0699999999997
that's also one of the tactics of the

3098.369 --> 3104.04
Dark One's if you just can't win

3101.07 --> 3105.96
then let the good guys win and let them

3104.04 --> 3108.21
get all drowning in their

3105.96 --> 3110.01
self-confidence and raffle and become

3108.21 --> 3112.5
weak and then when they're weak is

3110.01 --> 3114.75
strike back and you try again that's

3112.5 --> 3116.99
what they do that's what they have done

3114.75 --> 3120.18
and that's what they will always do

3116.99 --> 3126.0899999999997
hence the whole saying and the relevance

3120.18 --> 3134.6299999999997
to it is it again prosperity makes

3126.09 --> 3138.03
monsters and adversity makes men and

3134.63 --> 3140.33
that's just as a cycle it's never gonna

3138.03 --> 3140.3300000000004
go away

3142.82 --> 3151.32
yeah I like it

3144.57 --> 3154.4100000000003
feel good like the subjects of today I'm

3151.32 --> 3157.73
glad I could share some stuff that has

3154.41 --> 3157.73
been very deep in my heart

3161.71 --> 3166.869
and I like that I'm having these

3163.45 --> 3171.819
discussions about complex stuff in my

3166.869 --> 3173.71
chat and I'm not resorting to just

3171.819 --> 3177.19
outright banning somebody because they

3173.71 --> 3179.38
don't believe in the Bible because I

3177.19 --> 3182.41
won't do that just like if somebody's

3179.38 --> 3183.4900000000002
gonna be a global and they're gonna be

3182.41 --> 3184.839
literally blue blue blue

3183.49 --> 3186.339
yeah that's annoying if you're gonna be

3184.839 --> 3187.99
trolling with that yeah I might

3186.339 --> 3190.0
eventually time you out and all that

3187.99 --> 3192.52
stuff and if you're just a genuine

3190.0 --> 3195.43
believer and you're here to learn or to

3192.52 --> 3197.05
share some things then I want value and

3195.43 --> 3199.72
I kind of want to do the same thing with

3197.05 --> 3204.4
God although I if you're gonna get

3199.72 --> 3206.5589999999997
really blasphemous or just blasphemous

3204.4 --> 3212.079
on purpose that kind of thing then I

3206.559 --> 3216.03
will definitely start time your venue

3212.079 --> 3216.03
but yeah they literally it's been very

3216.78 --> 3224.1600000000003
reasonable so that's good thank you for

3220.99 --> 3224.16
that all of you

3228.609 --> 3234.0989999999997
all right yeah

3238.2 --> 3253.23
he did know D PJ Thanks oh not surprised

3245.16 --> 3255.96
I can't really say how I can't really

3253.23 --> 3258.119
point at it except now I can kind of

3255.96 --> 3260.5190000000002
because it has to do with certain

3258.119 --> 3262.2200000000003
individual he's also tried to make me

3260.519 --> 3265.0789999999997
contact that my healer weren't

3262.22 --> 3270.39
specifically about and I think that

3265.079 --> 3271.5
Randy took a ticket but I can't prove

3270.39 --> 3273.569
anything about it

3271.5 --> 3278.49
but we'll just see it it just feels like

3273.569 --> 3280.319
it he acts like it so and now I'm

3278.49 --> 3282.5
referencing to something that Owen

3280.319 --> 3286.14
Benjamin talks about taking the ticket

3282.5 --> 3288.39
and I think he took the ticket I can't

3286.14 --> 3290.339
prove it though well we'll see maybe

3288.39 --> 3295.0789999999997
you'll even start bragging about it at

3290.339 --> 3297.089
some point you probably will well yeah

3295.079 --> 3298.829
yeah when you do that you make a lot of

3297.089 --> 3304.74
freaking money that's right

3298.829 --> 3308.4
Oh glorious money it's only gonna cost

3304.74 --> 3316.95
you the actual ability to enjoy it

3308.4 --> 3318.839
that's all eventually that is but we'll

3316.95 --> 3320.97
see I don't know what happened I had

3318.839 --> 3323.22
look I'm not subscribed to Randy anymore

3320.97 --> 3327.75
it's just being a total dick to me every

3323.22 --> 3332.7889999999998
single time he can and I don't know what

3327.75 --> 3335.69
show he did yesterday was another rumpus

3332.789 --> 3335.69
earth in year

3341.95 --> 3347.109
yeah yeah you go playing an anchor I

3344.2 --> 3353.22
know he's being a petty high school

3347.109 --> 3353.22
bully to me I know

3360.049 --> 3364.7889999999998
don't do that please Sara Tina

3369.069 --> 3389.249
I mean Sarita Cosentino don't go I think

3386.829 --> 3393.039
you're referring to PTA they're right

3389.249 --> 3395.6499999999996
look I even caught that one in the 90s

3393.039 --> 3400.559
when I said that the number of the beast

3395.65 --> 3404.099
is six exist but the number of is it of

3400.559 --> 3408.009
Satan or whatever of the dark one was

3404.099 --> 3410.259
six one six apparently and I've had

3408.009 --> 3416.799
thoughts about it but it's also a cult

3410.259 --> 3420.239
[ __ ] 666 means supposedly the monster

3416.799 --> 3423.999
within humanity so that is like well

3420.239 --> 3427.059
people turning beast as we can see a lot

3423.999 --> 3429.759
of people are just shameless disgusting

3427.059 --> 3436.63
behavior you could consider that as the

3429.759 --> 3438.699
Beast it's not Satan though again when

3436.63 --> 3440.589
you go into that little corner then you

3438.699 --> 3443.319
could just spend freakin decades

3440.589 --> 3444.189
speculating about that [ __ ] I don't do

3443.319 --> 3448.359
it anymore

3444.189 --> 3451.709
you know I'll unleash my instant

3448.359 --> 3454.959
thoughts on things but I'm not gonna

3451.709 --> 3457.029
just start digging for that kind of

3454.959 --> 3457.739
stuff right I don't care the number yeah

3457.029 --> 3460.209
exactly

3457.739 --> 3470.039
number four the carbon atom that's right

3460.209 --> 3470.0389999999998
I don't know it feels that whole thing

3477.47 --> 3481.97
where is that even like what part is

3480.62 --> 3489.02
that where they start throwing the

3481.97 --> 3491.5
numbers which books are those because it

3489.02 --> 3498.38
just feels to me like that is a part

3491.5 --> 3500.35
where when you call them again D or

3498.38 --> 3503.83
where the occultist have been unleashed

3500.35 --> 3508.66
where they started doing things with it

3503.83 --> 3510.95
maybe that whole weird setup is like

3508.66 --> 3515.24
just added in there

3510.95 --> 3517.46
like as their form of trying to occult

3515.24 --> 3520.9599999999996
ly describe what's plan and what's going

3517.46 --> 3520.96
on I don't know

3524.29 --> 3531.2799999999997
no but look the littleit if you consider

3528.22 --> 3534.37
this if you just follow my example what

3531.28 --> 3537.1000000000004
I just said if 6x6 is well the carbon

3534.37 --> 3540.3399999999997
atom is just natural or maybe six six

3537.1 --> 3543.61
six the beast as it is described is the

3540.34 --> 3545.59
dark side within every human that can be

3543.61 --> 3550.57
unleashed that you just let yourself go

3545.59 --> 3553.81
turn into a monster become a demon all

3550.57 --> 3556.27
right well yeah people that do that are

3553.81 --> 3559.12
any kind of satanic that's kind of what

3556.27 --> 3561.63
that is it is literally throwing

3559.12 --> 3566.85
everything away and becoming the

3561.63 --> 3566.85
opposite of logos

3573.19 --> 3581.589
I see okay all right anyway I probably

3579.16 --> 3584.23
people like Paul are just gonna be

3581.589 --> 3586.9
laughing at me as I say this because I

3584.23 --> 3590.319
know damn Bible study err sorry no damn

3586.9 --> 3593.859
there's no damming about the Bible I'm

3590.319 --> 3599.23
just to be fair I've never even totally

3593.859 --> 3602.8489999999997
read the book I heard a lot about it and

3599.23 --> 3606.43
if read parts had a lot of quotes and

3602.849 --> 3609.0
I've yeah even reading part of it I'd

3606.43 --> 3609.0
feel it

3610.53 --> 3621.6400000000003
what no album Oh God

3615.359 --> 3624.42
Amanda young did a super chat jacket

3621.64 --> 3624.42
came through what

3644.15 --> 3651.9100000000003
oh well I did appear to me but look that

3646.85 --> 3651.91
super chat was before the show started

3654.58 --> 3659.72
like just a few minutes before the show

3658.94 --> 3662.77
started

3659.72 --> 3662.77
she dropped that one

3669.45 --> 3675.99
yeah it is a big book indeed and parts

3673.14 --> 3682.049
are even kind of left out still being

3675.99 --> 3684.54
disputed it's just so big you know it's

3682.049 --> 3695.19
kind of too big for a human to

3684.54 --> 3696.96
completely master it I'm thinking I

3695.19 --> 3703.68
wonder what will happen if you kind of

3696.96 --> 3706.71
like program a heavy AI to simulate a

3703.68 --> 3709.799
human but with more more oversight more

3706.71 --> 3712.079
cognitive function I don't know this is

3709.799 --> 3715.079
kind of sci-fi talk I guess but I wonder

3712.079 --> 3719.1800000000003
if they would see more connections than

3715.079 --> 3719.1800000000003
people have so far been able to spot

3720.5 --> 3730.099
yeah you go played an anchor you oh you

3723.21 --> 3730.099
sent wait what's going on

3731.07 --> 3736.0800000000004

doesn't come through apparently but yeah

3786.619 --> 3792.829
also PayPal PayPal is just much more

3790.459 --> 3794.799
direct I would really prefer that I've

3792.829 --> 3797.8900000000003
even considered just turning off the

3794.799 --> 3801.68
super chat in favor of PayPal because

3797.89 --> 3804.589
then I at least really get it and no

3801.68 --> 3809.1189999999997
struggles with that nonsense but anyway
