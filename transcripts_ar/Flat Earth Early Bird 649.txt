yeah so yeah that today the weather is

108.0 --> 113.92
like turn around again

111.68 --> 115.60000000000001
so it's actually been quite cloudy rainy

113.92 --> 118.64
and windy

115.6 --> 122.719
very moist not super hot

118.64 --> 126.88
or cold i mean not super cold

122.719 --> 128.56
oh yeah had some nice weather yesterday

126.88 --> 131.759
but today it's kind of back to

128.56 --> 131.75900000000001
what it was before that

132.64 --> 139.11999999999998
no patches of blue sky anywhere

136.48 --> 141.28
had some really interesting visuals by

139.12 --> 144.08
the way

141.28 --> 145.84
during my newspaper rounds i almost

144.08 --> 148.0
wished i could have filmed it but then

145.84 --> 149.28
also realized that such things you can't

148.0 --> 152.16
really film it like that

149.28 --> 153.36
not the way you see it because there was

152.16 --> 156.48
just yeah it was pretty

153.36 --> 157.04000000000002
blue sky yesterday with a couple of

156.48 --> 159.35999999999999
clouds

157.04 --> 160.72
no rain and when i went out for my

159.36 --> 164.0
newspapers

160.72 --> 168.16
it was just a really huge thick

164.0 --> 170.64
cloud that was kind of separated though

168.16 --> 173.2
and it was sitting right in front of

170.64 --> 176.64
this the apparent sun

173.2 --> 179.67999999999998
and it it had a [ __ ]

176.64 --> 181.2
crepuscular ray effect except it wasn't

179.68 --> 184.15900000000002
like through

181.2 --> 186.48
the clouds but it was past the clouds

184.159 --> 187.12
and was an amazing sight you could see

186.48 --> 190.07999999999998
like these

187.12 --> 191.12
beams it's like the light beams you

190.08 --> 194.0
could almost like

191.12 --> 195.12
cut them out visually because they were

194.0 --> 197.76
that distinct

195.12 --> 200.31900000000002
amazing sight absolutely amazing i wish

197.76 --> 203.28
i could have filmed it

200.319 --> 206.23899999999998
definitely was staring at it a lot

203.28 --> 209.519
because it was really beautiful

206.239 --> 209.519
but anyway um

210.959 --> 216.64000000000001
i got tamara coffee with me and green

214.4 --> 216.64000000000001
tea

217.92 --> 223.67999999999998
let's see who's in chat so far i'm

220.72 --> 223.68
starting a little early

223.76 --> 230.239
because i can good service first

227.44 --> 232.48
tiny wombo sarita cosatino good to see

230.239 --> 232.48000000000002
you

235.519 --> 241.519
all right yeah hello neil doing okay i'm

239.36 --> 245.36
kind of grumpy though

241.519 --> 249.12
this good servant has uh felt

245.36 --> 251.76000000000002
this morning got a lot of really

249.12 --> 252.31900000000002
annoying trolling but then also figured

251.76 --> 254.159
out

252.319 --> 257.519
it's kind of logical because good

254.159 --> 257.519
servant and me did a stream

258.16 --> 264.8
uh from when was it was it

261.44 --> 267.68
yesterday or two days ago i don't uh

264.8 --> 268.24
but yeah that was quite a controversial

267.68 --> 271.84000000000003
stream

268.24 --> 274.16
and like i was energetic

271.84 --> 275.11999999999995
almost to the point of hostility and

274.16 --> 280.0
yeah

275.12 --> 280.0
because i was kind of like grouchy

281.6 --> 286.639
and yeah even though we didn't record

284.24 --> 287.68
our entire conversation like the first

286.639 --> 291.36
half i was like

287.68 --> 294.08
really getting pissed off and [ __ ] and

291.36 --> 295.52000000000004
uh but then when i cool down a little we

294.08 --> 297.35999999999996
started recording but it was still kind

295.52 --> 299.12
of grouchy and i think yeah

297.36 --> 302.16
you know when we talk about this sort of

299.12 --> 304.0
thing and get kind of like angry

302.16 --> 307.03900000000004
it tends to rub a lot of people the

304.0 --> 309.36
wrong way that specifically try to not

307.039 --> 312.639
do that

309.36 --> 316.16
but yeah for me it's different

312.639 --> 318.24
because i i don't know for me

316.16 --> 321.44
and this is this is kind of weird though

318.24 --> 325.28000000000003
maybe maybe it's not

321.44 --> 328.71999999999997
it but for me like being a christian

325.28 --> 330.71999999999997
really means you got to keep testing it

328.72 --> 332.72
you got to keep that you can't just

330.72 --> 334.639
settle like oh this is how i'm

332.72 --> 336.72
hearing this is how i'm interpreting

334.639 --> 340.08
this this is what people tell about it

336.72 --> 340.08000000000004
and that's it no

340.32 --> 344.4
like the more i deal with the world the

342.8 --> 346.8
more i realize that so

344.4 --> 349.35999999999996
much like everything has pretty much

346.8 --> 350.56
been convoluted by ego actions of people

349.36 --> 352.47900000000004
in some way

350.56 --> 353.68
and it's very hard to even pick up on it

352.479 --> 356.0
because

353.68 --> 357.84000000000003
it's been like occultly normalized in

356.0 --> 362.16
ways

357.84 --> 362.79999999999995
yeah i just came to that realization

362.16 --> 366.47900000000004
that

362.8 --> 368.56
this normalization of letting your ego

366.479 --> 369.68
do things manipulate things it's

368.56 --> 373.36
probably not

369.68 --> 375.36
inherent to human culture even it was

373.36 --> 377.6
probably

375.36 --> 381.84000000000003
it's probably part of the programming in

377.6 --> 381.84000000000003
the last 200 years

382.56 --> 386.08
probably wasn't always like that

386.56 --> 390.4
and yeah like the good guys the ones

389.199 --> 392.56
that really try to

390.4 --> 395.52
go with christianity they try to oppose

392.56 --> 398.8
it but by doing that

395.52 --> 402.639
they basically in certain elements

398.8 --> 404.72
halt their learning process it's

402.639 --> 406.479
this yeah this is becoming kind of vague

404.72 --> 408.56
you know a lot of people are still very

406.479 --> 410.15999999999997
smart and find their own ways through to

408.56 --> 415.12
continue that

410.16 --> 418.319
it's just a general conception like

415.12 --> 420.56
modern christian group culture

418.319 --> 423.28000000000003
has a lot of problems especially

420.56 --> 426.24
stagnation problems

423.28 --> 427.44
getting getting stuck in the swamp kind

426.24 --> 430.639
of problems

427.44 --> 433.12
yeah in many ways and it pisses me off

430.639 --> 437.039
in general

433.12 --> 437.039
and so yeah being all

438.479 --> 441.75899999999996
kind of oppositionally defined as i

440.56 --> 444.479
naturally am

441.759 --> 446.16
can't i really can't help it it tried

444.479 --> 448.8
man

446.16 --> 450.8
uh yeah i'm taking the opposite position

448.8 --> 452.319
say no no i'm going to keep testing

450.8 --> 453.039
every element i'm going to figure out

452.319 --> 457.12
what this is

453.039 --> 457.12
how i regard it and

457.36 --> 459.84000000000003
keep the

461.28 --> 467.35999999999996
the esoteric interpretation

464.72 --> 469.03900000000004
going like i am still a christian you

467.36 --> 472.08000000000004
know i can't just

469.039 --> 474.479
swipe it all off the table

472.08 --> 476.4
because that's literally undoing it so

474.479 --> 480.479
it's almost like a puzzle

476.4 --> 483.599
how do i get it more real

480.479 --> 488.31899999999996
more durable more more clear

483.599 --> 488.319
to me and add it yeah i am not

488.56 --> 492.24
i'm not taking anybody else's standards

491.039 --> 495.039
by that

492.24 --> 497.12
really going my own path here and it's

495.039 --> 500.15999999999997
bound to basically

497.12 --> 501.68
cross over other people's past that

500.16 --> 504.96000000000004
might see it as that i'm

501.68 --> 507.28000000000003
actually being a bad christian or

504.96 --> 508.23999999999995
not doing it right i'm gonna get a lot

507.28 --> 510.71999999999997
of that

508.24 --> 512.479
or maybe not maybe people do really get

510.72 --> 515.519
it by now a lot of them i don't know

512.479 --> 518.64
anymore man i really don't know it's

515.519 --> 521.44
i'm doing my best to keep it real and

518.64 --> 524.959
it's not as easy as you would think

521.44 --> 524.9590000000001
such heavy [ __ ]

526.56 --> 531.8389999999999
and yeah there's definitely been some

529.68 --> 535.4399999999999
trolls out there that have just started

531.839 --> 537.839
squirting again

535.44 --> 538.8800000000001
and i'm pretty damn sure that these

537.839 --> 540.6400000000001
people also

538.88 --> 544.48
have a lot of sock accounts that they

540.64 --> 544.48
just set on to people

544.56 --> 550.7199999999999
maybe friends circles i don't know how

548.08 --> 552.32
they're surviving the way they are so

550.72 --> 554.24
they must have some kind of like

552.32 --> 555.6
connection network of people that just

554.24 --> 556.48
have nothing better to do with their

555.6 --> 559.36
life that will

556.48 --> 561.519
then help support doing that just

559.36 --> 564.48
ridiculous

561.519 --> 564.48
the troll network

574.839 --> 577.839
anyway

580.0 --> 582.64
oh dear

584.0 --> 588.56
oh yeah yeah yeah see there's one in

586.8 --> 592.88
chat already

588.56 --> 592.88
yep and open we didn't need a

594.399 --> 598.399
remove [ __ ] with balls message headed

596.8 --> 600.8
it's just the trolls and and

598.399 --> 602.72
look they think they yeah i got comments

600.8 --> 605.8389999999999
like how dare you

602.72 --> 608.8000000000001
be so so

605.839 --> 611.519
repulsive about what i said about my p

608.8 --> 612.8
900 this is that's so unthankful and

611.519 --> 615.839
great for all

612.8 --> 616.64
squared squared squared right and

615.839 --> 619.839
somebody else

616.64 --> 622.8
messaged me like and this is just it's

619.839 --> 623.9200000000001
hilarious to me but said like oh owen

622.8 --> 627.68
benjamin

623.92 --> 630.56
should sue you for using the word

627.68 --> 630.959
squirting and grabblers and rogans and

630.56 --> 634.399
all that

630.959 --> 637.5189999999999
seriously like what really

634.399 --> 642.64
like do you say that

637.519 --> 645.44
to like the bears as well you know

642.64 --> 647.6
it's ridiculous yeah by the way

645.44 --> 649.6
apparently owen benjamin was live i saw

647.6 --> 652.0
a quick pop-up

649.6 --> 652.72
yesterday night but i yeah it wasn't

652.0 --> 656.48
there

652.72 --> 660.64
when it was live so i haven't seen him

656.48 --> 663.04
for a while now

660.64 --> 663.04
anyway

670.16 --> 675.8389999999999
almost as bad as gusset what is gusset

682.48 --> 685.6800000000001
punch what

686.839 --> 690.8000000000001
yeah what is

694.0 --> 697.519
okay we got some trolls in chat that's

696.64 --> 699.36
late in the office

697.519 --> 702.16
just wondering like what what they're

699.36 --> 705.519
actually trying to achieve here

702.16 --> 706.399
that's all fine because yeah i know what

705.519 --> 709.839
i do and i'm

706.399 --> 712.48
definitely gonna go continue

709.839 --> 713.7600000000001
do what i do and yeah you could get a

712.48 --> 715.9200000000001
hundred more of your

713.76 --> 717.6
buddies or bots or whatever the [ __ ]

715.92 --> 719.519
you're supposed to be out there in my

717.6 --> 724.399
chat or on my comments or

719.519 --> 727.36
whining about me making more videos

724.399 --> 729.92
calling me like a satanist or whatever

727.36 --> 730.32
because i criticize certain elements or

729.92 --> 732.24
have

730.32 --> 734.8000000000001
tough questions that i'm not afraid to

732.24 --> 738.9590000000001
ask people

734.8 --> 738.959
right because i don't care

739.12 --> 746.48
you know like if people

742.88 --> 748.72
like in military outfits or whatever

746.48 --> 750.48
came to my door every day and told me

748.72 --> 753.519
that i needed to stop

750.48 --> 755.6800000000001
i'd still continue okay

753.519 --> 757.6
yeah sounds sounds a bit overkill right

755.68 --> 760.959
not gonna happen anytime soon

757.6 --> 763.279
but yeah i'm that set i'm doing this

760.959 --> 765.3599999999999
it was a very tough choice for me to go

763.279 --> 767.2
with this but now that i have chosen i'm

765.36 --> 771.04
going to do this until i

767.2 --> 774.24
die so you can't stop me

771.04 --> 778.16
you really can't really

774.24 --> 781.04
really can't you know if everybody

778.16 --> 782.639
even on the flat earth community side

781.04 --> 785.04
would turn on me

782.639 --> 787.2
like everyone everybody all the big

785.04 --> 789.5999999999999
players come together and say look this

787.2 --> 791.2
irwin is just bad news man

789.6 --> 793.519
i don't know where he's going but it's

791.2 --> 795.36
getting all demonic and [ __ ]

793.519 --> 796.88
i might even give some reason for that

795.36 --> 800.5600000000001
interpretations

796.88 --> 804.32
i'd still keep going

800.56 --> 804.6389999999999
because i don't care and i'm pretty sure

804.32 --> 806.48
that

804.639 --> 808.88
nathan is not going to do that because

806.48 --> 812.72
he gets a little devilish himself

808.88 --> 814.8
in a controlled way but yeah if he

812.72 --> 817.519
ejects me yeah then

814.8 --> 820.079
then i'd be sad because uh yeah it would

817.519 --> 824.24
be to me like being kicked out of school

820.079 --> 824.2399999999999
again not that it really happened

824.8 --> 828.8
that yeah i've never been kicked out of

826.399 --> 832.079
school just for the record

828.8 --> 833.5999999999999
never you know i have not always behaved

832.079 --> 836.3199999999999
as nicely

833.6 --> 836.32
as i tried

837.76 --> 844.399
yeah yada yada meecan if you heard

840.88 --> 844.959
have you heard our win is all evil now

844.399 --> 847.519
and

844.959 --> 848.56
like everybody's talking about it but

847.519 --> 850.72
yeah that still

848.56 --> 853.199
doesn't mean that i'm gonna stop doing

850.72 --> 855.1990000000001
what i do

853.199 --> 857.3599999999999
you know because as i said before there

855.199 --> 861.12
is no amount of peer

857.36 --> 871.839
pressure threat or anything that's going

861.12 --> 871.839
to make me stop doing this

873.6 --> 881.44
it's just not gonna happen sorry

876.88 --> 881.4399999999999
and not sorry very very not sorry

883.199 --> 887.3599999999999
it's just a habit to say sorry after

886.399 --> 890.88
such a

887.36 --> 891.519
comment maybe it is sorry to the people

890.88 --> 893.8389999999999
that i do

891.519 --> 896.32
care about that i have to get rough that

893.839 --> 900.1600000000001
kind of sorry it's like sorry kids but

896.32 --> 900.639
dad has to yeah get a bit rough right

900.16 --> 903.12
now

900.639 --> 913.839
that's pretty much the way i say sorry

903.12 --> 913.839
when i say it like that

914.48 --> 920.24
hey aries 106 and a meekin

917.839 --> 920.24
of course

931.92 --> 935.5999999999999
well there's some there's a certain

934.32 --> 939.36
certain specific

935.6 --> 941.44
uh goblin out there i didn't even know

939.36 --> 944.9590000000001
he was a goblin you know he was nuts

941.44 --> 949.1990000000001
and then i saw actual live video of him

944.959 --> 952.2399999999999
and then i knew holy [ __ ] have i

949.199 --> 956.959
underestimated that

952.24 --> 956.9590000000001
you know who we speak of good servant

961.839 --> 964.8800000000001
but yeah there are some people out there

964.56 --> 967.5999999999999
that

964.88 --> 970.32
they just really don't like me they

967.6 --> 972.9590000000001
really and that it's mutual

970.32 --> 975.0400000000001
it's just that i'm not gonna waste all

972.959 --> 978.6389999999999
my time on focusing on them because

975.04 --> 978.639
they're a literal waste of time

978.959 --> 983.8389999999999
their consistency level within their

981.759 --> 988.0790000000001
train of thinking and conceptions

983.839 --> 991.839
is average at best

988.079 --> 994.3199999999999
they don't really build

991.839 --> 996.32
learning structures this is what i do i

994.32 --> 997.44
build learning structures i think of

996.32 --> 1000.0790000000001
ideas and then i

997.44 --> 1000.5600000000001
build it and then i keep on explaining

1000.079 --> 1002.7199999999999
it

1000.56 --> 1004.2399999999999
expanding the explanation getting it

1002.72 --> 1006.48
better

1004.24 --> 1009.6
realizing mistakes grafting in other

1006.48 --> 1013.519
things if necessary this is what i do

1009.6 --> 1015.839
they don't barely anyone out there

1013.519 --> 1016.9590000000001
really does that [ __ ] in the first place

1015.839 --> 1019.0400000000001
most are just

1016.959 --> 1020.4799999999999
focusing on trying to get it as

1019.04 --> 1023.36
convincing as they can

1020.48 --> 1024.88
and beautiful imagery and and just being

1023.36 --> 1029.039
very confident and

1024.88 --> 1031.679
circle jerking or whatever right

1029.039 --> 1033.36
or they don't build anything and they

1031.679 --> 1036.48
just focus on how shitty

1033.36 --> 1036.4799999999998
that other group is

1037.6 --> 1040.6399999999999
of course i psychoanalyze that other

1040.24 --> 1043.52
group

1040.64 --> 1044.48
in this case being the ballers but yeah

1043.52 --> 1046.6399999999999
that's not just

1044.48 --> 1048.0
it's not the only division out there

1046.64 --> 1050.48
it's plenty of

1048.0 --> 1052.24
self-proclaimed flat earthers that yeah

1050.48 --> 1056.4
that have divided themselves

1052.24 --> 1058.16
in like rebel group groups or

1056.4 --> 1061.039
outsiders that don't want to go along

1058.16 --> 1061.039
with it anymore

1062.0 --> 1066.72
that yeah that kind of drift off into

1064.88 --> 1069.7600000000002
their own weird thing

1066.72 --> 1073.3600000000001
that's very obviously not gonna lead to

1069.76 --> 1075.28
some win it's more like oh this is just

1073.36 --> 1078.32
they can just do that and then they're

1075.28 --> 1081.28
among their own sort of and

1078.32 --> 1083.9189999999999
yeah they just keep on going well i'm

1081.28 --> 1087.12
actually trying to really build stuff

1083.919 --> 1091.44
in my mind conceptions figuring it out

1087.12 --> 1092.0
and hey the amelia the meteoric helium

1091.44 --> 1094.3200000000002
cycle

1092.0 --> 1095.76
is yeah only one of their most recent

1094.32 --> 1100.3999999999999
conceptions

1095.76 --> 1100.4
that in my opinion is probably extremely

1100.72 --> 1107.84
on target i've realized even that

1105.36 --> 1110.32
some of the details i put out about it

1107.84 --> 1111.6789999999999
it's so on target that it might actually

1110.32 --> 1113.76
be risky

1111.679 --> 1115.44
like this might actually be a secret

1113.76 --> 1119.28
weapon of theirs that i've just

1115.44 --> 1124.0
exposed just by thinking about it

1119.28 --> 1126.3999999999999
right really it's risky

1124.0 --> 1127.84
and ever since i did that particular

1126.4 --> 1130.64
hangout

1127.84 --> 1131.76
all kinds of [ __ ] have has suddenly

1130.64 --> 1134.5590000000002
broken open

1131.76 --> 1137.919
a whole can of worms got open and and

1134.559 --> 1140.559
not even in a direct response to it

1137.919 --> 1141.679
not even addressing the content but ever

1140.559 --> 1143.9189999999999
since i did that

1141.679 --> 1146.96
particular hangout a whole kind of worm

1143.919 --> 1146.96
seemed to have opened up

1147.52 --> 1151.76
massive vote rigging now yeah and it's

1150.72 --> 1153.84
happening

1151.76 --> 1156.64
regularly especially with hangouts that

1153.84 --> 1159.9189999999999
i titled and it happens retroactively

1156.64 --> 1162.0800000000002
also i noticed they choke the actual

1159.919 --> 1165.8400000000001
view count not just the vote count but

1162.08 --> 1169.1999999999998
the view count as well

1165.84 --> 1172.24
like especially that

1169.2 --> 1175.44
that particular hangout has

1172.24 --> 1175.44
very little views

1176.559 --> 1180.3999999999999
compared to most

1181.44 --> 1186.0
and so did my the three way to follow

1183.84 --> 1187.84
rules and that was a very fascinating

1186.0 --> 1190.72
hangout i thought

1187.84 --> 1193.6789999999999
it's just and i'm looking and i'm

1190.72 --> 1197.52
looking at my older videos

1193.679 --> 1199.52
and it just doesn't make a whole lot of

1197.52 --> 1202.1589999999999
sense

1199.52 --> 1203.6
i'm getting very little views for

1202.159 --> 1207.8400000000001
something that's

1203.6 --> 1207.84
that's out there some of it a year

1209.679 --> 1215.2800000000002
so either people are kind of avoiding it

1213.28 --> 1217.2
because it's all too much and they'll

1215.28 --> 1220.3999999999999
just settle with what i'm dealing with

1217.2 --> 1223.679
on the day that it's live or anything

1220.4 --> 1225.3600000000001
or yeah i'm just being much more choked

1223.679 --> 1228.0
by youtube than i ever

1225.36 --> 1228.0
even thought

1230.72 --> 1235.84
what's that tom parker

1246.84 --> 1249.84
okay

1251.36 --> 1255.9189999999999

1255.919 --> 1259.679
wow that is a big one sheesh

1260.96 --> 1277.41

1264.799 --> 1280.559
or set it free without any wounds

1277.41 --> 1280.559
[Music]

sunset investigation

1290.0 --> 1294.48
ah you let it free okay i hope it didn't

1292.64 --> 1295.919
get too hard you know

1294.48 --> 1297.6
if they got a hook in their mouth and

1295.919 --> 1300.88
they're gonna be uh like

1297.6 --> 1302.8799999999999
squiggling all over the place

1300.88 --> 1306.0
yeah they can get hurt uh you know about

1302.88 --> 1320.159
that anyway nice catch

hey

1328.88 --> 1335.0390000000002
i've set this even

1332.159 --> 1335.679
during uh last year at the end during

1335.039 --> 1338.48
the

1335.679 --> 1339.76
fv conference in amsterdam i even said

1338.48 --> 1342.96
back then

1339.76 --> 1345.12
sure i'm i'm basically

1342.96 --> 1346.08
up for doing things together you know it

1345.12 --> 1349.12
would be handy

1346.08 --> 1351.52
because i don't have a car anymore

1349.12 --> 1352.559
so yeah do stuff together with other

1351.52 --> 1355.76
people

1352.559 --> 1358.08
i was a guy he's also a follower

1355.76 --> 1360.0
from amsterdam but i think he's just

1358.08 --> 1361.6
been too busy overall

1360.0 --> 1363.039
we had a few moments where we were

1361.6 --> 1364.8799999999999
considering going out

1363.039 --> 1366.64
and doing stuff but it didn't yeah we

1364.88 --> 1370.24
didn't come to it

1366.64 --> 1372.5590000000002
but i'm i'm technically open for that

1370.24 --> 1374.72
you know as long as it's not like oh all

1376.96 --> 1380.4
work but

1377.76 --> 1382.559

and i'll take my p900 with me

if you know what i mean

1399.679 --> 1403.8400000000001

1473.52 --> 1478.48
said gecko hello here we go again

1478.559 --> 1482.3999999999999
i don't think yesterday was a full moon

1482.559 --> 1486.32
you know there was clear skies in the

1484.4 --> 1489.039
night and there i could see the moon but

1486.32 --> 1489.039
it wasn't full

1489.679 --> 1493.279
i don't know if it's going to be full

1491.2 --> 1494.88
tonight i don't you could check these

1493.279 --> 1497.279
things you know but

1494.88 --> 1497.279
whatever

1499.12 --> 1504.4799999999998
he makes corona rules and he violated

1501.2 --> 1504.48
themselves okay sure

1510.48 --> 1515.679
okay tom parker well it's not about your

1513.44 --> 1517.919
relation it's about location in this

1515.679 --> 1517.919
case

1518.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
and don't you have a p900

1522.24 --> 1529.84
i thought you did i have i don't know

1540.84 --> 1543.84
um

1544.72 --> 1549.2
why do you not go out for some of today

1547.279 --> 1551.52
because

1549.2 --> 1551.52
it's

1552.24 --> 1557.679
yeah you know it's not it's ridiculous

1555.84 --> 1559.039
yeah i could literally just do that

1557.679 --> 1562.24
every day and just have

1559.039 --> 1564.799
some shot i don't want to it seems

1562.24 --> 1567.36
useless to me

1564.799 --> 1569.36
now unless i could have some transport

1567.36 --> 1572.8799999999999
and or a real

1569.36 --> 1573.84
project that yeah that would be make it

1572.88 --> 1576.3200000000002
worth it

1573.84 --> 1578.08
and i might go out there but you know

1576.32 --> 1581.6789999999999
the original

1578.08 --> 1585.279
angle to the situations back then was to

1581.679 --> 1587.3600000000001
prove the black swan it's already done

1585.279 --> 1591.52
and there's people to this day that

1587.36 --> 1593.52
already that have a much better location

1591.52 --> 1594.799
that are doing these kinds of shots on a

1593.52 --> 1599.279
daily basis

1594.799 --> 1602.72
why would i have to do that also

1599.279 --> 1605.36
it's not it's not really gonna

1602.72 --> 1612.0
give some on the edge proof of anything

1605.36 --> 1615.6789999999999
it's already settled

1612.0 --> 1617.36
okay clayton black hello the news on the

1615.679 --> 1621.3600000000001
deep state takedown in holland well they

1617.36 --> 1621.36
certainly seem to be making some effort

1621.52 --> 1625.2
there's a lot of yeah

1625.6 --> 1630.32
friction anger going down in the

1627.44 --> 1634.159
netherlands about policies

1630.32 --> 1638.0
and the government and yeah it see

1634.159 --> 1640.64
yeah i think there's a good chance that

1638.0 --> 1641.52
that it will actually be taken down or

1640.64 --> 1644.96
be stopped

1641.52 --> 1649.679
at least like people are

1644.96 --> 1652.799
very very alert on the

1649.679 --> 1655.039
on things that have happened so far

1652.799 --> 1657.12
that the military has been allowed to

1655.039 --> 1658.559
assist in stopping very specific

1657.12 --> 1662.2399999999998
protests

1658.559 --> 1666.84
and yeah that all the policies

1662.24 --> 1669.6
considering corona are all completely

1666.84 --> 1671.76
useless

1669.6 --> 1673.039
and that yeah it's just destroying the

1671.76 --> 1677.84
economy people are

1673.039 --> 1677.84

1680.72 --> 1683.44
alert

1681.279 --> 1686.24

1683.44 --> 1686.24
united states

1694.0 --> 1697.84
thank you tiny will move

1698.64 --> 1711.8400000000001

1736.0 --> 1740.799
you know what tiny wombo i'm gonna give

1739.039 --> 1744.0
you a wrench

1740.799 --> 1747.52
i think you know how it works

1744.0 --> 1747.52
i think i can trust you with one

1747.679 --> 1752.799
and hey if you disprove me in that i'll

1750.48 --> 1755.44
take it away again

1752.799 --> 1757.279
but yeah don't don't feel the need to

1755.44 --> 1759.279
now start using it that's not what i

1757.279 --> 1760.799
tend to give it out for it's more like a

1759.279 --> 1762.88
symbol of trust

1760.799 --> 1765.12
and hey it might be easy for you because

1762.88 --> 1768.8000000000002
now you can just post links

1765.12 --> 1771.9799999999998
so thank you for hanging around

1768.8 --> 1771.98
[Music]

1774.0 --> 1780.48
get a replica peanut what

1777.44 --> 1780.88
uh that's hilarious here chico it really

1780.48 --> 1785.52
is

1780.88 --> 1786.7990000000002
but here's the issue a replica of a p900

1785.52 --> 1790.799
that really looks alike

1786.799 --> 1790.799
is probably gonna cost some

1790.96 --> 1799.279
is that really worth it

1795.12 --> 1802.399
unless somebody i don't know can make a

1799.279 --> 1803.2
plastic paper mache p900 look alike and

1802.399 --> 1805.4399999999998
can send it

1803.2 --> 1806.72
to me in the mail without it breaking in

1805.44 --> 1809.3600000000001
the in the

1806.72 --> 1811.84
in the transport i i would know how to

1809.36 --> 1811.84
make that

1815.76 --> 1823.44
i don't know maybe just taking like an

1819.6 --> 1825.52
old p900 frame

1823.44 --> 1827.039
and then it all the gears out and just

1825.52 --> 1829.36
have like a hollow

1827.039 --> 1831.52
camera maybe with a lens on it maybe

1829.36 --> 1834.6399999999999
that might work

1831.52 --> 1838.32
but still i don't know man it seems

1834.64 --> 1838.3200000000002
seems kind of a waste for a joke

1842.159 --> 1846.0
oh that's that's very funny lynn

1844.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
anderson

1846.0 --> 1851.84
i wouldn't no thanks

1855.2 --> 1858.72
printed out on paper

1859.279 --> 1865.84
oh god yes very funny aries 106.

1876.08 --> 1883.12
now no i it doesn't really matter just

1879.44 --> 1885.519
let them whine about it oh yeah

1883.12 --> 1886.399
you're getting one too definitely

1885.519 --> 1893.84
deserve it

1886.399 --> 1893.84
i know you're very trustworthy

1896.799 --> 1900.0
can you show you okay well john bernards

1899.44 --> 1906.0800000000002
i know

1900.0 --> 1910.64
you are sure

1906.08 --> 1910.6399999999999
see there it is

1918.84 --> 1921.84
yay

1928.559 --> 1932.559
how do you get rid of aches and pains

1930.72 --> 1935.1200000000001
without meds

1932.559 --> 1936.24
well that depends on the nature of those

1935.12 --> 1938.2399999999998
aches and pains

1936.24 --> 1940.64
a lot of aches and pains are kind of

1938.24 --> 1942.88
side effects of

1940.64 --> 1946.3200000000002
slightly unbalanced or outright

1942.88 --> 1946.3200000000002
unhealthy eating habits

1947.279 --> 1950.72
but yeah there's all kinds of herbs you

1949.2 --> 1954.0800000000002
can

1950.72 --> 1955.039
use to yeah to kind of work against it

1954.08 --> 1958.0
so

1955.039 --> 1960.48
you can either go anti-inflammation or

1958.0 --> 1960.48
natural

1961.519 --> 1965.1200000000001
well this mostly anti-inflammation type

1964.399 --> 1967.76
of herbs

1965.12 --> 1968.32
usually work against pain the best it

1967.76 --> 1970.72
usually

1968.32 --> 1973.279
fixes the issues that tends to cause the

1970.72 --> 1978.24
pain in the first place

1973.279 --> 1981.2
so in in general i'd say that turmeric

1978.24 --> 1981.76
is a great herb to get rid of all or

1981.2 --> 1983.919
yeah to

1981.76 --> 1984.96
fight off all kinds of pain and has so

1983.919 --> 1988.48
many sides effect

1984.96 --> 1991.679
so many good positive side effects

1988.48 --> 1992.88
so especially joint and muscle related

1991.679 --> 1996.0800000000002
aches

1992.88 --> 1999.519
or even just from being sore i know from

1996.08 --> 2003.4399999999998
heavy impact or from over training

1999.519 --> 2006.64
tumeric is great and that's just one

2003.44 --> 2008.96
one herb but it works really well it's

2006.64 --> 2011.2
one of the reasons i got tamara coffee

2008.96 --> 2013.8400000000001
you know

2011.2 --> 2015.76
people might not remember but yeah what

2013.84 --> 2019.12
is it a year ago or more

2015.76 --> 2022.72
i started to put tumeric powder

2019.12 --> 2022.7199999999998
in the coffee

2023.039 --> 2026.1589999999999
like so it's there's a coffee filter

2024.799 --> 2027.9189999999999
there's the coffee powder i put the

2026.159 --> 2029.519
tumeric in it i mix it up with the

2027.919 --> 2031.279
coffee powder

2029.519 --> 2033.36
then water goes through that and

2031.279 --> 2034.559
basically takes an extract and you can

2033.36 --> 2038.32
taste it

2034.559 --> 2041.76
and ever since i've done that

2038.32 --> 2045.279
i don't get as much stomach ache

2041.76 --> 2046.559
from coffee because coffee does seem to

2045.279 --> 2049.76
always make kind of a big

2046.559 --> 2052.72
impact on me especially on my stomach

2049.76 --> 2054.48
and that really works so yeah there you

2052.72 --> 2056.72
go

2054.48 --> 2060.32
[Music]

2056.72 --> 2063.2
turmeric and pepper yeah i also add it's

2060.32 --> 2065.3590000000004
the tumeric it's like uh five parts

2063.2 --> 2068.399
turmeric one part pepper

2065.359 --> 2071.52
black pepper and then mix that in

2068.399 --> 2075.52
just just with let's say

2071.52 --> 2080.079
one little of these spoons like this

2075.52 --> 2080.079
just a little spoon i mix it in with

2080.32 --> 2083.679
the coffee so you don't overdo it and

2082.48 --> 2086.879
that'll be

2083.679 --> 2087.2000000000003
yeah the taste will get a bit yucky if

2086.879 --> 2090.0789999999997
you

2087.2 --> 2090.0789999999997
put too much in it

2091.04 --> 2095.52
all right so and the tumeric and the

2093.119 --> 2099.44
pepper i use is just organic

2095.52 --> 2099.44
from a general organic brand

2099.839 --> 2103.359
it's basically from the organic

2101.52 --> 2105.2
supermarket hey and if you can find

2103.359 --> 2117.839
better versions you know i'm pretty sure

2105.2 --> 2117.839
they're out there

2119.119 --> 2122.1600000000003
there's really good tumeric supplements

2121.04 --> 2125.04
out there

2122.16 --> 2127.2
this was just kind of a cheap trick to

2125.04 --> 2130.32
do it myself without

2127.2 --> 2131.7599999999998
necessarily having to have a garden and

2130.32 --> 2134.079
make the tumeric

2131.76 --> 2136.1600000000003
like grow the turmeric myself that would

2134.079 --> 2136.7200000000003
even be better if that's a possibility i

2136.16 --> 2140.56
don't know

2136.72 --> 2142.56
how difficult it is to grow turmeric

2140.56 --> 2144.0789999999997
but that would be even better just man

2142.56 --> 2147.2799999999997
can you imagine just

2144.079 --> 2150.079
a fresh tumeric root

2147.28 --> 2151.119
squeeze it or juice it and then that

2150.079 --> 2153.8390000000004
juice would be

2151.119 --> 2154.48
very intense you wouldn't need any black

2153.839 --> 2158.56
pepper

2154.48 --> 2161.67
added on to that for sure

2158.56 --> 2161.67
[Music]

2179.44 --> 2188.0
okay fan

2182.88 --> 2191.04
of h s

2188.0 --> 2191.04
c song

2198.839 --> 2201.839
sure

2204.56 --> 2211.68
right gotta switch better sure

2208.4 --> 2213.76
you know and the thing is i always eat

2211.68 --> 2214.0
organic and i use everything organic

2213.76 --> 2217.44
it's

2214.0 --> 2220.24
really been a key cornerstone of my own

2217.44 --> 2221.92
care for myself but hey there's plenty

2220.24 --> 2223.52
of people that don't necessarily eat

2221.92 --> 2225.119
everything organic and they're just very

2223.52 --> 2227.2
careful with

2225.119 --> 2228.88
with the kind of vegetables and meat

2227.2 --> 2231.2
sources they pick

2228.88 --> 2233.359
and i'm sure that just regular tumeric

2231.2 --> 2236.72
root from non-organic brand

2233.359 --> 2240.24
non-organic brands will also be

2236.72 --> 2242.0
pretty okay it's also gonna work it's

2240.24 --> 2245.5989999999997
just that yeah the more pure

2242.0 --> 2248.72
it is the better it'll work

2245.599 --> 2250.079
so yeah and the tumeric or tumeric roots

2248.72 --> 2250.8799999999997
i think you could just buy them

2250.079 --> 2253.2000000000003
everywhere now

2250.88 --> 2255.28
it's it's been normalized it's been

2253.2 --> 2257.04
discovered and really spread out it's

2255.28 --> 2261.44
like this is a good idea

2257.04 --> 2261.44
and it was turmeric is a good idea

2266.24 --> 2270.16
if you bathe in it yeah you will damn

2269.04 --> 2274.48
well turn yellow

2270.16 --> 2274.48
goddess witch bella can be sure about

2282.839 --> 2285.839
that

2286.079 --> 2289.3590000000004
yeah if you want to do it right then you

2288.16 --> 2293.359
take a bath full of

2289.359 --> 2294.16
tumeric juice you put a couple of scoops

2293.359 --> 2296.72
of

2294.16 --> 2298.0
red beet juice in there and then a lot

2296.72 --> 2300.8799999999997
of carrot juice on top

2298.0 --> 2303.1
of that and then you bathe in that let's

2300.88 --> 2305.04
see what comes out of that

2303.1 --> 2308.3199999999997
[Music]

2305.04 --> 2312.0
and hey it would all be healthy but

2308.32 --> 2314.48
probably leave some interesting

2312.0 --> 2314.48
colors

2320.16 --> 2323.04
if you know what i mean

2323.52 --> 2341.839
a trump bath thanks tiny wumbo

2327.599 --> 2341.839
thank you i needed that

2355.2 --> 2359.1189999999997
yeah if you take orange beets and

2358.32 --> 2361.92
turmeric

2359.119 --> 2362.4
and carrot juice and put that in yeah

2361.92 --> 2365.2000000000003
you

2362.4 --> 2367.119
definitely have a trump bath that's

2365.2 --> 2370.0
right

2367.119 --> 2371.76
but i specifically put in the the like

2370.0 --> 2374.56
the

2371.76 --> 2375.5200000000004
the red beets and they're more purplish

2374.56 --> 2379.599
so that wouldn't

2375.52 --> 2379.599
eventually mix up into an orange

2381.04 --> 2384.48
i don't know what how it would mix up

2383.92 --> 2386.32
maybe

2384.48 --> 2388.48
more be like a brownish color i don't

2386.32 --> 2388.48
know

2390.64 --> 2394.8799999999997
yeah you know because when you usually

2392.32 --> 2396.7200000000003
when you mix orange and purple

2394.88 --> 2398.4
which are counter opposite colors you

2396.72 --> 2401.5989999999997
tend to get brown

2398.4 --> 2404.96
so like a dirty

2401.599 --> 2404.96
dirty kind of brown

2408.839 --> 2411.839
anyway

2422.839 --> 2427.44
wow

2424.48 --> 2427.44
that's special

2432.16 --> 2439.839
thank you obermuco for the moderation

2441.68 --> 2448.56
oh yeah by the way uh again look i'm

2445.119 --> 2450.319
focusing a little on my uh on my

2448.56 --> 2453.599
meteoric

2450.319 --> 2456.8
helium cycle show

2453.599 --> 2460.2400000000002
and i would like a lot of people to yeah

2456.8 --> 2466.2400000000002
again go there go to that specific

2460.24 --> 2470.4799999999996
show and

2466.24 --> 2473.4399999999996
watch it and upvote it

2470.48 --> 2474.319
because yeah it's oh it's gone up to two

2473.44 --> 2478.0
up votes i

2474.319 --> 2479.359
i just want it back and whatever they're

2478.0 --> 2480.24
doing whether they're showing an

2479.359 --> 2483.52
artificial

2480.24 --> 2485.68
extract a pattern of slow like fake

2483.52 --> 2487.7599999999998
slow growth while the rest is all piled

2485.68 --> 2491.44
up waiting to be shown

2487.76 --> 2493.5200000000004
i want it to end up like one of the

2491.44 --> 2496.8
biggest shows of this year

2493.52 --> 2498.8
for me because it deserves to be it's a

2496.8 --> 2502.0
really good show

2498.8 --> 2503.6800000000003
and i i it yeah it's being choked by

2502.0 --> 2509.359
youtube and it needs

2503.68 --> 2512.48
to be seen thought about spread wide

2509.359 --> 2514.48
so i'm asking all of you to personally

2512.48 --> 2516.48
if you're gonna go to other flat

2514.48 --> 2520.839
earthers chats

2516.48 --> 2524.0
ask them ask them about

2520.839 --> 2526.24
do what would you think he

2524.0 --> 2527.599
like where does the helium go could it

2526.24 --> 2530.0789999999997
be that helium might turn

2527.599 --> 2530.88
into meteorites somehow keep it that

2530.079 --> 2533.76
simple

2530.88 --> 2534.88
and then tell them about this hangout if

2533.76 --> 2538.48
you guys could do that

2534.88 --> 2540.1600000000003
i would be very grateful and upvote it

2538.48 --> 2541.76
and yeah let's see okay there's some of

2540.16 --> 2543.92
votes

2541.76 --> 2551.119
according to roger let's see if it

2543.92 --> 2553.599
actually registers

2551.119 --> 2554.88
okay it does seem to register there's

2553.599 --> 2557.76
now four visible

2554.88 --> 2559.119
now keep it up and don't mind the down

2557.76 --> 2561.2000000000003
votes because i'm pretty sure it's

2559.119 --> 2563.2000000000003
linearly tied in

2561.2 --> 2564.48
so whenever there's an upvote there will

2563.2 --> 2566.8799999999997
automatically like

2564.48 --> 2567.52
instantly be a downfall registered as

2566.88 --> 2571.28
well

2567.52 --> 2571.68
doesn't matter i want it to be one of

2571.28 --> 2579.2000000000003
the

2571.68 --> 2582.0
most viewed hangouts i've done this year

2579.2 --> 2582.0
because it's worth it

2582.24 --> 2587.2799999999997
and i will keep on doing this

2585.52 --> 2588.88
to going to what hey i did it on the

2587.28 --> 2590.7200000000003
flat earth debates

2588.88 --> 2593.119
in the after show yesterday i said it

2590.72 --> 2595.04
like yeah i'm really pissed off i want

2593.119 --> 2598.96
this specific show

2595.04 --> 2599.2799999999997
to be seen not just because it's good

2598.96 --> 2602.319
but

2599.28 --> 2605.52
also because i'm so sick of youtube just

2602.319 --> 2608.72
choking my work choking it

2605.52 --> 2612.72
preventing spread giving a flare of

2608.72 --> 2621.839
of worthlessness artificially

2612.72 --> 2621.839
i'm sick of it

2623.04 --> 2627.119
getting some israeli commercials on my

2625.359 --> 2628.88
show hey no doubt

2627.119 --> 2632.96
no doubt i have no problem you know i

2628.88 --> 2634.8
have no problem even with israeli people

2632.96 --> 2636.2400000000002
you know that a lot of them are actually

2634.8 --> 2640.1600000000003
really nice like

2636.24 --> 2644.3999999999996
really nice but yeah they

2640.16 --> 2644.3999999999996
they live in a kind of a weird world

2644.96 --> 2650.88
it's yeah it's hard to

2648.079 --> 2652.96
explain i'd have to it's it's a bit

2650.88 --> 2653.359
sensitive too so i can't just you know i

2652.96 --> 2655.28
don't

2653.359 --> 2657.5989999999997
know i don't it's not literally like i

2655.28 --> 2658.3190000000004
have had long-term israeli friends or

2657.599 --> 2660.839
anything

2658.319 --> 2662.0
but i've always paid attention i always

2660.839 --> 2664.0789999999997
had

2662.0 --> 2666.56
like this feeling about israel like this

2664.079 --> 2668.88
is so weird what's going on there

2666.56 --> 2670.4
these people aren't bad but at the same

2668.88 --> 2674.2400000000002
time the government is

2670.4 --> 2677.119
like creepy as [ __ ] at times and they're

2674.24 --> 2678.9599999999996
they're like they seem to be wanting to

2677.119 --> 2682.079
be at the core of a lot of

2678.96 --> 2682.079
world schemes

2682.72 --> 2687.359
directly or indirectly banking

2685.68 --> 2689.68
[Music]

2687.359 --> 2694.4
the banking core seems to also be have

2689.68 --> 2694.3999999999996
all all have a foot in israel somehow

2695.28 --> 2699.2000000000003
rattlers so yeah there's so much about

2698.4 --> 2701.76
it

2699.2 --> 2703.1189999999997
but to be fair i know very little about

2701.76 --> 2705.8390000000004
it

2703.119 --> 2706.319
i know there is more to be known about

2705.839 --> 2710.48
it

2706.319 --> 2713.359
i know that for as much so

2710.48 --> 2715.68
yeah and please don't get ad block

2713.359 --> 2715.68
please

2715.76 --> 2720.0
because every time an advertisement does

2718.0 --> 2723.119
play on my channel

2720.0 --> 2723.76
it it does give youtube and me some

2723.119 --> 2733.28
revenue

2723.76 --> 2735.5200000000004
that will help eventually

2733.28 --> 2735.52
oh

2743.04 --> 2747.839
let me finish that

2750.319 --> 2754.0
it it's fine look if you really can't

2752.48 --> 2757.04
help you just

2754.0 --> 2760.4
you really insist on not seeing ads

2757.04 --> 2764.0
okay sure but just know it is also

2760.4 --> 2767.28
kind of helping my stats and all that

2764.0 --> 2769.92
and i don't know man at some point

2767.28 --> 2772.1600000000003
yeah i've actually i'm i'm considering

2769.92 --> 2774.48
it although i don't see any possibility

2772.16 --> 2775.44
for myself just yet i've really

2774.48 --> 2778.88
considered just

2775.44 --> 2782.8
abandoning youtube and when i do that

2778.88 --> 2786.0
removing all my videos and their ads

2782.8 --> 2788.4
just taking it all away and i'll take my

2786.0 --> 2791.52
business somewhere else i've

2788.4 --> 2794.7200000000003
yeah because i'm that sick

2791.52 --> 2794.72
of how things are done

2797.04 --> 2802.56
the life yeah deal life sounds nice

2800.24 --> 2805.1189999999997
but yeah there is just this big problem

2802.56 --> 2808.48
with all alternatives and that is

2805.119 --> 2813.119
they don't have storage space

2808.48 --> 2815.44
they don't so

2813.119 --> 2816.88
yeah you can't just go to another

2815.44 --> 2820.4
channel say like oh yeah

2816.88 --> 2823.839
that's cool i have this database with

2820.4 --> 2826.319
almost 700 episodes that i need to be

2823.839 --> 2829.359
uploaded and available for people that

2826.319 --> 2832.64
are part of my channel yeah

2829.359 --> 2835.359
right you know what i mean

2832.64 --> 2836.48
that's that's very unlikely and then

2835.359 --> 2838.48
probably

2836.48 --> 2840.559
you know there might be some groups out

2838.48 --> 2842.559
there that have that capability that

2840.559 --> 2844.559
might be able to do something like that

2842.559 --> 2847.599
but who am i

2844.559 --> 2848.3190000000004
you know is that worth it i don't think

2847.599 --> 2851.52
so

2848.319 --> 2852.72
i'm very unadapted in what i do so

2851.52 --> 2854.319
there's not a lot of people

2852.72 --> 2857.359
with that option that are going to be

2854.319 --> 2859.44
like oh yeah let's get irwin in there

2857.359 --> 2861.92
and probably not even flat earthers

2859.44 --> 2861.92
because i'm just

2862.0 --> 2873.839
i'm not advertisement friendly enough

2866.0 --> 2873.839
to say roughly

2876.079 --> 2882.079
or i'm just very inconvenient okay yeah

2879.04 --> 2882.079
leave that ban to me

2884.839 --> 2887.839
uh

2892.64 --> 2899.52
yes john bernard i know i know

2896.16 --> 2903.359
all look all groups

2899.52 --> 2906.64
that would suggest that their group

2903.359 --> 2907.359
is has more rights than all than the

2906.64 --> 2910.24
rest

2907.359 --> 2915.839
all of those are just wrong all of those

2910.24 --> 2915.839
are bad news all of them

2934.48 --> 2940.72
although yeah in general it's not

2940.839 --> 2946.7999999999997
like it's so difficult because

2944.559 --> 2947.8390000000004
it's kind of an exact like that concept

2946.8 --> 2952.1600000000003
of that

2947.839 --> 2956.7999999999997
one group has rights the others don't

2952.16 --> 2959.359
it's basically a an exaggeration a

2956.8 --> 2960.1600000000003
drawing a concept out to the maximum

2959.359 --> 2963.839
limit

2960.16 --> 2966.5589999999997
and ignoring morality at it

2963.839 --> 2967.2
it's a basic going about of taking care

2966.559 --> 2968.96
of your own

2967.2 --> 2970.96
that's really where it comes from and

2968.96 --> 2974.0
that is a good thing

2970.96 --> 2976.559
see that is good and

2974.0 --> 2978.64
having a group identity of your own the

2976.559 --> 2980.079
people that you deal with that you trust

2978.64 --> 2983.2
and

2980.079 --> 2985.599
concepts that you agree with all that

2983.2 --> 2987.04
yeah that is good but when you then

2985.599 --> 2989.6800000000003
start to basically draw

2987.04 --> 2991.2799999999997
borders declare enemies to those who

2989.68 --> 2994.16
aren't part of it

2991.28 --> 2994.8
that's where it goes wrong that's where

2994.16 --> 2999.839
it becomes

2994.8 --> 2999.8390000000004
extremely immoral

3027.599 --> 3031.28
there used to be people that believe in

3029.52 --> 3034.16
the globe

3031.28 --> 3035.599
no i'm afraid it's not going to be that

3034.16 --> 3038.5589999999997
easy i think that the

3035.599 --> 3040.8
mind disease of globe belief and the

3038.559 --> 3043.44
reversed world reality

3040.8 --> 3045.04
on top of it it's all tied in i think

3043.44 --> 3046.2400000000002
we're not going to be able to get rid of

3045.04 --> 3048.64
it as easily

3046.24 --> 3051.2
you know eventually it will turn more

3048.64 --> 3054.4
into the

3051.2 --> 3055.52
the cult i think it really will i think

3054.4 --> 3059.839
it will turn into

3055.52 --> 3062.64
the cult a worldwide

3059.839 --> 3062.64
mind cult

3062.96 --> 3065.599
the devil

3067.2 --> 3071.5989999999997
and it probably in a way used to be

3070.16 --> 3075.2799999999997
there's just been

3071.599 --> 3079.28
given a lot of information to

3075.28 --> 3082.4
fill in details of that cult

3079.28 --> 3083.2000000000003
it's been produced grabblers have

3082.4 --> 3087.359
technically

3083.2 --> 3091.1189999999997
tricked society in producing

3087.359 --> 3093.839
their double think reversed world

3091.119 --> 3096.0
cult information people have been

3093.839 --> 3099.44
tricked into making their works

3096.0 --> 3101.52
for them and that's happened over

3099.44 --> 3104.96
hundreds of years now

3101.52 --> 3107.52
so that cult was always there

3104.96 --> 3108.8
they're the satanists the real ones not

3107.52 --> 3111.839
some

3108.8 --> 3111.8390000000004
larp religion

3113.44 --> 3120.64
and they build a reversed reality

3117.76 --> 3121.28
and they like to stay there and they've

3120.64 --> 3124.7999999999997
tricked

3121.28 --> 3126.88
humanity into filling in the details of

3124.8 --> 3129.92
that reversed world reality

3126.88 --> 3132.4
for them they didn't make it

3129.92 --> 3133.28
they can't make anything they can only

3132.4 --> 3137.2000000000003
control

3133.28 --> 3140.559
and extinguish now they tricked humanity

3137.2 --> 3142.5589999999997
into making it for them and that's not

3140.559 --> 3145.8390000000004
gonna go away very quickly

3142.559 --> 3148.079
because even if people

3145.839 --> 3149.359
in general the majority start to realize

3148.079 --> 3154.1600000000003
like yeah

3149.359 --> 3156.64
it really was a big lie it really was

3154.16 --> 3157.44
they're still still going to be people

3156.64 --> 3159.5989999999997
that will be

3157.44 --> 3160.64
in the oppositional position and just

3159.599 --> 3164.88
say no no

3160.64 --> 3167.2
no it's not true no you're all crazy

3164.88 --> 3169.119
just like 20 years ago just like 40

3167.2 --> 3170.8799999999997
years ago

3169.119 --> 3172.6400000000003
even though all that information is

3170.88 --> 3175.359
available

3172.64 --> 3176.48
because a part of this spell staying in

3175.359 --> 3179.52
that reversed world

3176.48 --> 3180.0
is that you don't find out that you

3179.52 --> 3183.839
don't

3180.0 --> 3186.24
really make sure you assert

3183.839 --> 3188.4
fill it in and use a have a ready

3186.24 --> 3190.7999999999997
available database on how to

3188.4 --> 3194.2400000000002
fill it in and in the process avoid

3190.8 --> 3196.7200000000003
actually learning about it a

3194.24 --> 3200.9599999999996
very devious very elaborate very

3196.72 --> 3204.319
detailed system of psychological control

3200.96 --> 3206.48
and humanity helps build it

3204.319 --> 3208.16
for the grabblers they've been tricked

3206.48 --> 3210.16
into building it for them

3208.16 --> 3211.7599999999998
and it's here now it's not going to go

3210.16 --> 3214.16
away just by

3211.76 --> 3217.44
learning it's wrong and how it works

3214.16 --> 3219.92
doesn't mean it's going to go away

3217.44 --> 3221.839
there will still be poop people tricked

3219.92 --> 3224.319
into

3221.839 --> 3225.119
becoming that into getting sucked into

3224.319 --> 3228.48
that and not

3225.119 --> 3230.319
being able to climb out again it's going

3228.48 --> 3233.839
to be out there

3230.319 --> 3236.16
even if there might be whole sectors on

3233.839 --> 3236.48
the earth where it will be declassified

3236.16 --> 3240.24
yes

3236.48 --> 3242.4
it wasn't a ball that's not right

3240.24 --> 3245.04
even if that happens it's it's not gonna

3242.4 --> 3248.559
go away that easily

3245.04 --> 3251.44
because it is it is satan it is

3248.559 --> 3253.6800000000003
the lie it is the spirit of the lie it's

3251.44 --> 3256.16
carried by people and people can't let

3253.68 --> 3259.5989999999997
it go

3256.16 --> 3262.3999999999996
because it is their other side that it

3259.599 --> 3262.4
accounts for

3262.8 --> 3268.319
and the only thing that the truth can do

3265.2 --> 3271.7599999999998
is try to deal with that damn ego

3268.319 --> 3273.119
so that it doesn't do damage that's not

3271.76 --> 3275.119
super appealing

3273.119 --> 3279.04
so if there's an entire mechanism out

3275.119 --> 3281.839
there just readily available for you to

3279.04 --> 3283.7599999999998
to let your ego get caught up into so it

3281.839 --> 3287.839
doesn't personally bother you

3283.76 --> 3289.599
as much as noticeably it's always

3287.839 --> 3291.04
going to do that there will always

3289.599 --> 3295.839
people just switch

3291.04 --> 3298.48
just like that even if they're your kid

3295.839 --> 3300.16
it's gonna happen it's not gonna go away

3298.48 --> 3304.319
unfortunately

3300.16 --> 3307.1189999999997
all we can do is just master what it is

3304.319 --> 3308.4
and deal with those that get stuck into

3307.119 --> 3311.839
it

3308.4 --> 3315.28
and learn the signs of how you can

3311.839 --> 3321.839
get them out it's very difficult

3315.28 --> 3321.8390000000004
it's always will be difficult

3332.839 --> 3335.839
huh

3349.52 --> 3354.48
yeah zaptapi we don't live in a world

3352.64 --> 3357.2799999999997
where it can work like that why don't

3354.48 --> 3357.28
you give that up

3357.52 --> 3362.4
it's that's the global prerogative

3360.24 --> 3364.799
that's what globers rest on

3362.4 --> 3365.76
everything is done right oh so not

3364.799 --> 3368.319
everything is done

3365.76 --> 3371.28
well why don't you do it then because

3368.319 --> 3373.68
that's not how the world works

3371.28 --> 3374.3190000000004
it would only be doable if it was

3373.68 --> 3377.1189999999997
allowed

3374.319 --> 3378.64
to be doable if there was finance and

3377.119 --> 3381.28
room

3378.64 --> 3381.2799999999997
to do it

3385.28 --> 3388.4
and as long as the powers that be

3387.68 --> 3391.44
currently

3388.4 --> 3394.559
say no it's going to be no

3391.44 --> 3396.64
so there is no option to do it you can

3394.559 --> 3397.6800000000003
think that there is you could be fooled

3396.64 --> 3401.92
by other

3397.68 --> 3404.24
ballers that there is it's not

3401.92 --> 3405.28
you can't move freely out there you

3404.24 --> 3410.0789999999997
can't

3405.28 --> 3410.079
they'll stop you admittedly so

3412.24 --> 3415.7599999999998
they give you plenty of story [ __ ]

3415.04 --> 3418.88
to

3415.76 --> 3420.96
to make it easy on yourself to fool

3418.88 --> 3422.4
yourself that there is plenty of option

3420.96 --> 3424.88
to do that

3422.4 --> 3426.1600000000003
so you don't have to be concerned about

3424.88 --> 3430.559
it and question

3426.16 --> 3432.48
why so you can just say oh

3430.559 --> 3435.2000000000003
oh you have so much left to prove

3432.48 --> 3438.4
because we've all proven it right

3435.2 --> 3440.319
right that

3438.4 --> 3442.319
yeah it's just pointing the fingers like

3440.319 --> 3444.4
oh why don't you prove it it's so easy

3442.319 --> 3447.68
to prove it why don't you just do it

3444.4 --> 3448.64
yeah because you can't just because

3447.68 --> 3451.04
you've all been

3448.64 --> 3461.839
told that you can doesn't mean that you

3451.04 --> 3461.839
actually can

3466.98 --> 3473.1
[Music]

3475.92 --> 3482.88
yeah yeah that guy's not welcome here

3479.76 --> 3484.7990000000004
you know might even think he can behave

3482.88 --> 3486.6400000000003
halfway decently in chat even though

3484.799 --> 3489.92
he's the freaking icon of that

3486.64 --> 3492.319
sick bastard so he's already pretty much

3489.92 --> 3494.16
a freaking satanist there

3492.319 --> 3496.319
somebody that doesn't care that thinks

3494.16 --> 3498.0789999999997
that monsters are cool

3496.319 --> 3501.04
because he uses it as their his icon

3498.079 --> 3505.52
right and he's put some chats

3501.04 --> 3508.96
or some comments that are so disgusting

3505.52 --> 3508.96
that guy is not welcome here

3511.04 --> 3517.839
so yeah get out of here get

3526.64 --> 3530.0
oh scott parker almost you almost got it

3529.119 --> 3532.6400000000003
right it's not

3530.0 --> 3535.68
actually where the sky meets the ground

3532.64 --> 3539.839
for me or position it's where it appears

3535.68 --> 3541.839
to meet the ground or very close

3539.839 --> 3543.119
because it's all it's an apparent effect

3541.839 --> 3546.72
the horizon is not a

3543.119 --> 3549.04
physical thing it's an apparent thing

3546.72 --> 3551.7599999999998
now if there was a physical geometry

3549.04 --> 3554.16
then there would be a literal

3551.76 --> 3555.3590000000004
geometrical horizon which would work

3554.16 --> 3558.96
slightly differently

3555.359 --> 3562.0
with different

3558.96 --> 3564.2400000000002
traits but it's not

3562.0 --> 3565.04
it's all flat so the horizon that we

3564.24 --> 3567.359
experience

3565.04 --> 3568.72
is just apparent it's just the apparent

3567.359 --> 3570.16
place

3568.72 --> 3572.3999999999996
where the sky meets the ground it

3570.16 --> 3576.96
doesn't actually

3572.4 --> 3576.96
it's just the visual effect

3585.04 --> 3591.92
no bobby digital that's impossible

3588.72 --> 3597.68
there's no camera that could yeah

3591.92 --> 3597.6800000000003
that has that kind of refraction

3598.0 --> 3601.92
that yeah you know refraction will

3600.319 --> 3605.68
always eventually

3601.92 --> 3607.6800000000003
blur up how far you can see

3605.68 --> 3610.24
and there is no lens that exists that

3607.68 --> 3612.64
could literally oversee

3610.24 --> 3614.799
all the yeah that size that couldn't

3612.64 --> 3618.24
that there's no camera that could reach

3614.799 --> 3620.559
that far it would just blur up after a

3618.24 --> 3620.5589999999997
point

3623.119 --> 3630.2400000000002
you know even was it the dr picard

3626.64 --> 3633.5989999999997
in his balloon you look through the big

3630.24 --> 3636.799
glass uh floor

3633.599 --> 3638.2400000000002
look down yeah he saw this pancake with

3636.799 --> 3640.319
upturned edges

3638.24 --> 3642.5589999999997
he didn't describe seeing all the

3640.319 --> 3646.079
continents though

3642.559 --> 3649.52
see why because

3646.079 --> 3653.119
doesn't matter after a certain distance

3649.52 --> 3656.24
you just don't see anything anymore

3653.119 --> 3658.96
because refraction causes all light

3656.24 --> 3660.8799999999997
all of it from there to be blurred up

3658.96 --> 3662.88
into a giant soup

3660.88 --> 3663.92
into a soup of color which will

3662.88 --> 3666.4
effectively be

3663.92 --> 3666.96
like a backdrop wall and even though

3666.4 --> 3670.0
there's

3666.96 --> 3674.16
absolutely probably things beyond that

3670.0 --> 3679.599
point that visual limit

3674.16 --> 3679.5989999999997
you won't see it so you can't you just

3682.839 --> 3685.839
can't

3690.96 --> 3697.44
anyway i'm rounding out the show ah

3694.24 --> 3698.0789999999997
there's a good show lots of activity in
