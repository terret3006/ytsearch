119.939 --> 122.53999999999999
so

122.719 --> 126.96
it is interesting

130.86 --> 136.8
some big clouds up there

134.04 --> 138.48
there's also some nice blue in between

136.8 --> 140.28
here and there

138.48 --> 142.379
was actually kind of nice and sunny

140.28 --> 144.42
before but now we have the clouds in

142.379 --> 147.06
front of it

144.42 --> 149.35999999999999
there still seem to be some Trails up

147.06 --> 149.36
there

150.239 --> 153.72
but yeah it's not taking away up the

152.28 --> 156.66
blue

153.72 --> 158.58
so far yeah Yesterday by the way all

156.66 --> 161.64
those trails

158.58 --> 163.86
like it totally turned into a gray soup

161.64 --> 166.5
not even two hours later

163.86 --> 169.459
completely and it was like clouded like

166.5 --> 169.459
that the rest of the day

172.14 --> 176.39999999999998
no rain came out of those clouds but

174.959 --> 178.879
yeah

176.4 --> 178.87900000000002
anyway

179.49 --> 182.589
[Music]

184.62 --> 186.739
um

187.2 --> 192.73899999999998
hello slo-mo moon buggy first in chat

190.019 --> 192.739
good to see you

195.18 --> 203.34
it is Friday the 19th of November 2021

207.42 --> 212.72
running on time for a change

209.459 --> 212.72
I was up kind of early

213.239 --> 217.92000000000002
so I'd actually been like waiting like

215.459 --> 220.31900000000002
when is it finally going to be one

217.92 --> 223.94
o'clock I want to start my show been

220.319 --> 223.94
kind of like that in last half hour

225.0 --> 229.94
but don't have to wait long

246.0 --> 251.34
all right

248.239 --> 252.59900000000002
yeah the one downside to certainly being

251.34 --> 255.599
on time

252.599 --> 258.18
when you're late a lot of the time 15 to

255.599 --> 260.4
30 minutes is that everybody starts to

258.18 --> 261.78000000000003
expect you to be late and then they show

260.4 --> 264.0
up late

261.78 --> 266.29999999999995
but yeah that's a problem of my own

264.0 --> 266.3
making

270.0 --> 272.54
huh

273.72 --> 277.5
couldn't see the eclipse what what

276.24 --> 281.04
eclipse

277.5 --> 283.58
some kind of eclipse moon eclipse

281.04 --> 283.58000000000004
what

289.02 --> 294.06
right

290.699 --> 295.74
anyway I have to make a special

294.06 --> 298.16
shout out

295.74 --> 298.16
to

299.16 --> 306.47900000000004
a baller I know as nerdy EE

303.539 --> 308.699
who actually yeah he told me like oh man

306.479 --> 311.75899999999996
I made a killing on the stock market and

308.699 --> 314.28000000000003
he donated like quite a substantial

311.759 --> 315.539
amount I thought first lady was just

314.28 --> 318.23999999999995
like

315.539 --> 321.84
trying to

318.24 --> 323.759
get my hopes up but he actually did so

321.84 --> 325.5
that was pretty awesome thank you very

323.759 --> 328.02000000000004
much nerdy EE

325.5 --> 331.86
he's the guy that contacted me a while

328.02 --> 334.32
ago because like he couldn't comment

331.86 --> 337.46000000000004
in my chat even though I don't have any

334.32 --> 337.46
nerdy EE

338.4 --> 345.62
in my blocked list so yeah seems to be a

342.419 --> 345.62
whole bunch of people like that

345.9 --> 349.32
but yeah

350.1 --> 354.44
Beaver what what is that

357.9 --> 362.4
anyway thanks dude

360.66 --> 367.34000000000003
and uh

362.4 --> 367.34
yeah that absolutely helps

367.62 --> 370.16
right

372.0 --> 375.44
low Gadget inspector

394.02 --> 396.74
right

399.6 --> 402.259
uh

409.979 --> 415.8
yeah by the way which is like

413.52 --> 418.28
remember that time when my channel kind

415.8 --> 418.28000000000003
of grew

419.34 --> 424.25899999999996
well it's been like going down again so

422.16 --> 428.22
I don't know what the hell's going on

424.259 --> 431.639
but I'm back to like 2082 now

428.22 --> 433.74
so weird

431.639 --> 437.78000000000003
like I don't understand how that all

433.74 --> 437.78000000000003
works why it works like that

438.36 --> 442.02000000000004
not that it really matters but it's just

440.46 --> 444.38
like I do keep track and it's kind of

442.02 --> 444.38
odd

447.78 --> 451.31899999999996
screen on my phone just cracked in front

450.18 --> 453.919
of you

451.319 --> 453.91900000000004
what

455.34 --> 460.81899999999996
okay

457.62 --> 460.819
that's messed up

471.0 --> 476.58
hmm well I dude I definitely were like

474.539 --> 478.62
return it say like yeah this glass is

476.58 --> 480.979
faulty like I didn't drop it it just

478.62 --> 480.979
broke

481.02 --> 486.08
hello g m c d x x

495.18 --> 499.5
all right anyway

496.919 --> 502.5
yesterday was a

499.5 --> 503.46
lots of good streams Flat Earth debates

502.5 --> 507.72
was

503.46 --> 509.4
intense kumu virus got on there again

507.72 --> 513.0600000000001
uh

509.4 --> 515.039
in the after show Mostly

513.06 --> 518.039
although I didn't we might have caught

515.039 --> 519.3
got on even before that I don't think so

518.039 --> 522.06
though

519.3 --> 523.8
but yeah I missed like as usual I

522.06 --> 525.66
typically missed like the second half of

523.8 --> 527.16
the live show because I go for groceries

525.66 --> 529.8
then

527.16 --> 530.8199999999999
I'm gonna do that again today maybe I'm

529.8 --> 532.56
even

530.82 --> 537.98
not going to be there the first half

532.56 --> 537.9799999999999
because there's quite some things

538.62 --> 542.839
groceries might take a little longer

545.04 --> 551.04
ah

547.74 --> 552.9590000000001
Mitch was fun yeah yeah indeed Mitchell

551.04 --> 555.06
from Australia

552.959 --> 557.9399999999999
well he did something different it was

555.06 --> 561.779
no live stream it was a premiere

557.94 --> 565.32
where he basically kind of made his own

561.779 --> 567.8389999999999
clips of all kinds of globers and crazy

565.32 --> 571.1400000000001
things they've said over the years

567.839 --> 573.6
so it kind of felt like a numpty clip

571.14 --> 577.86
a bit like that and it was a lot of fun

573.6 --> 581.0600000000001
and like hilarious to see it all back

577.86 --> 581.0600000000001
so that was interesting

590.82 --> 593.3000000000001
right

593.519 --> 601.519
made by Jim Bob had a great video again

597.959 --> 601.5189999999999
I don't typically catch those

604.74 --> 609.779
and oh yeah of course been watching own

607.68 --> 613.64
Benjamin pretty much

609.779 --> 613.64
up until I started the show

615.48 --> 620.24
and that was hilarious he was like

620.579 --> 622.6999999999999
um

624.3 --> 630.12
he was getting all racist against the

626.76 --> 631.86
Irish not not really but he was just

630.12 --> 634.62
taking it way out of proportion

631.86 --> 637.62
basically declaring them like their

634.62 --> 641.76
there's some kind of Graveler species it

637.62 --> 644.839
was ridiculous and silly but hilarious

641.76 --> 644.8389999999999
I thought at least

645.779 --> 648.42
he's been doing that sort of thing more

647.519 --> 652.32
and more

648.42 --> 654.36
like with everything and everybody

652.32 --> 657.5600000000001
uh

654.36 --> 657.5600000000001
Lil Mike sudunich

660.3 --> 664.279
I'll see King's video and

667.2 --> 670.7
I don't know that channel

678.0 --> 680.18
foreign

688.63 --> 691.84
[Applause]

703.88 --> 709.98
s in there and all that

707.0 --> 712.2
superconductive Dome I see four hours

709.98 --> 714.72
ago

712.2 --> 717.32
that's the dough

714.72 --> 717.32
sure

720.26 --> 726.2
this guy seems to be very much into

722.76 --> 726.2
mathematical patterns

728.1 --> 731.1800000000001
so it seems

733.62 --> 738.6
oh

735.959 --> 741.3199999999999
like this was his first video like in

738.6 --> 741.32
six months

745.98 --> 751.639
am I of sub to Flat Earth Observer no

751.8 --> 754.76
I don't think so

757.68 --> 762.68
slow day no no it's not a slow day at

760.5 --> 762.68
all

768.12 --> 775.76
it's going to be a great day

771.18 --> 775.76
because I got a PayPal from a baller

778.2 --> 782.24
that always gives me a special feeling

795.66 --> 800.66
level Earth Observer

798.18 --> 800.66
right

803.339 --> 807.139
okay I'll take a look at that channel

818.399 --> 825.5
okay

820.079 --> 825.5
right he seems to be in NASA analysis

828.6 --> 831.1990000000001
all right

833.16 --> 836.8389999999999
I have to sub to him

843.06 --> 847.56
and calls and the trolls out

845.699 --> 849.18
oh okay

847.56 --> 852.8599999999999
all right

849.18 --> 852.8599999999999
why not I'll sub to him

864.959 --> 868.88
a crane operator okay

873.139 --> 878.339
ah it seems the birds have finally

876.12 --> 880.76
discovered the bread

878.339 --> 880.7600000000001
something

881.88 --> 885.959
that I put out

883.74 --> 888.48
I haven't done that in a while also

885.959 --> 891.3599999999999
because my diet change don't really eat

888.48 --> 894.139
that much bread anymore right now

891.36 --> 894.139
uh

909.72 --> 912.32
right

913.38 --> 916.38
foreign

919.98 --> 922.98
okay

924.199 --> 930.18
you on average I find you at channels

927.839 --> 932.1
that I find to good taste so I'll I'll

930.18 --> 934.079
check it out

932.1 --> 937.519
if you like it

934.079 --> 937.519
it's a good chance it's pretty good

964.32 --> 966.98
hmm

967.759 --> 973.62
okay yeah but dude there's like so many

971.1 --> 975.9590000000001
channels out there with everything that

973.62 --> 978.839
I'm already typically following

975.959 --> 981.3
I can barely like

978.839 --> 983.6990000000001
get through it all

981.3 --> 986.399
that's also the reason why I'm not super

983.699 --> 988.74
here to like oh man I need some new

986.399 --> 991.199
channels because

988.74 --> 993.48
the channels that I do follow I really

991.199 --> 996.38
appreciate them but they already take up

993.48 --> 996.38
so much time

997.139 --> 1000.279
still worth it though

1005.36 --> 1010.399
each video is only three minutes for me

1008.48 --> 1012.1990000000001
what

1010.399 --> 1014.5
right yeah it does seem like short

1012.199 --> 1014.5
videos

1017.48 --> 1021.1
he doesn't have a playlist though

1022.88 --> 1027.439
right anyway

1024.559 --> 1030.6399999999999
thanks for the tip I'll take a look

1027.439 --> 1030.64
somewhere later today

1048.079 --> 1050.74
oh

1058.94 --> 1062.6000000000001
wow

1060.38 --> 1066.3200000000002
and wear and hair

1062.6 --> 1068.6599999999999
you're acting like it's your right to to

1066.32 --> 1071.4399999999998
comment there

1068.66 --> 1071.44
is it

1073.34 --> 1078.9189999999999
if he just likes to ban people

1076.58 --> 1082.22
then that's his prerogative like I have

1078.919 --> 1084.8600000000001
had my faces where I basically get

1082.22 --> 1087.799
really easy on the Banning as well

1084.86 --> 1090.08
it's not like you're right to be able to

1087.799 --> 1092.78
speak up

1090.08 --> 1095.48
in someone else's Channel I mean you

1092.78 --> 1097.46
have the right to make your own videos

1095.48 --> 1100.22
on your channel and then express your

1097.46 --> 1103.1000000000001
opinions about things

1100.22 --> 1107.559
but yeah that that right does not extend

1103.1 --> 1107.559
beyond your own Channel's activity

1110.059 --> 1114.34
do not cry when we ban your Channel

1114.679 --> 1120.3400000000001
on my channel You Can't Ban a channel

1117.32 --> 1120.34
it's ridiculous

1131.12 --> 1134.1999999999998
hey good servant

1134.78 --> 1136.96
foreign

1138.76 --> 1144.3799999999999
ER I think you're a gamma and I think

1141.98 --> 1146.1200000000001
that you have delusions of grandeur

1144.38 --> 1148.94
thinking that

1146.12 --> 1150.5
you have some kind of a power to take

1148.94 --> 1154.22
down people

1150.5 --> 1158.5
if they don't entertain your [ __ ]

1154.22 --> 1158.5
I don't think that's realistic

1179.919 --> 1185.8600000000001
ishan oh

1182.48 --> 1185.8600000000001
okay that would explain

1187.22 --> 1193.34
are you sure slow-mo moon buggy I mean

1189.799 --> 1195.52
yeah he definitely fits the pattern so

1193.34 --> 1195.52
far

1214.7 --> 1219.919
I mean how is he gonna get my channel

1216.86 --> 1222.4399999999998
banned he literally

1219.919 --> 1224.679
rips my streams and put it on his own

1222.44 --> 1224.679
channel

1226.22 --> 1230.679
and I'm graciously letting him do that

1230.84 --> 1233.6589999999999
right

1231.799 --> 1236.299
because doing that putting somebody

1233.659 --> 1238.8200000000002
else's stuff on your channel that's

1236.299 --> 1239.96
actually something you can get banned

1238.82 --> 1243.74
for

1239.96 --> 1246.26
if the the uh the one that you took it

1243.74 --> 1248.1200000000001
from is not in appreciation of that and

1246.26 --> 1250.8799999999999
is willing to take the effort to

1248.12 --> 1254.62
actually have it taken down because it

1250.88 --> 1254.6200000000001
can be a bit of a hassle right

1261.02 --> 1265.46
and especially if it's just regular

1264.02 --> 1268.1
commentary

1265.46 --> 1270.08
based on like

1268.1 --> 1272.78
a couple of minutes

1270.08 --> 1275.059
split up in segments right that's

1272.78 --> 1278.84
commentary if you literally just play

1275.059 --> 1282.02
entire segments of somebody's dream

1278.84 --> 1284.9599999999998
that's not commentary especially when

1282.02 --> 1289.0
it's live Sean

1284.96 --> 1289.0
somebody's still streaming it live

1290.96 --> 1294.88
I'm surprised you still have a channel

1296.419 --> 1300.88
anyway hey you on a plane

1316.22 --> 1322.7
right by the way not that I want your

1318.799 --> 1325.6399999999999
channel to be taken down Sean

1322.7 --> 1329.179
like don't mistake my uh

1325.64 --> 1331.64
my criticism for some kind of a

1329.179 --> 1334.299
that you're some kind of a threat I mean

1331.64 --> 1338.679
most people that I know and respect

1334.299 --> 1338.679
actually just think you're funny

1339.26 --> 1342.98
and annoying that's why they don't like

1341.12 --> 1345.1399999999999
to hang around but every time they're

1342.98 --> 1347.48
reminded about your presence the first

1345.14 --> 1353.14
thing that happens is they just have

1347.48 --> 1353.14
like ha look at that idiot that's funny

1353.96 --> 1360.02
so why would anybody really want to take

1356.48 --> 1363.38
that down it's just hilarious

1360.02 --> 1367.0
that you're doing what you're doing

1363.38 --> 1367.0
it's not a threat see

1373.7 --> 1379.159
Flat Earth should start striking Ballers

1376.039 --> 1381.52
now for no no Gadget inspector no they

1379.159 --> 1381.5200000000002
shouldn't

1381.919 --> 1385.88
I mean

1383.179 --> 1388.8400000000001
if somebody's like literally ripping

1385.88 --> 1388.8400000000001
your entire videos

1390.98 --> 1395.679
and then like adding crap on it

1395.84 --> 1400.6589999999999
or if they're trying to slander You by

1398.059 --> 1404.12
taking things out of context effectively

1400.659 --> 1407.0590000000002
not just like ooh stupid Loops of weird

1404.12 --> 1409.28
moments because that's just lame

1407.059 --> 1412.28
right Sean

1409.28 --> 1414.8799999999999
but yeah why would you really want to

1412.28 --> 1414.8799999999999
take them down

1416.419 --> 1422.38
it's not John well if it's not Sean then

1419.0 --> 1422.38
it still applies to Sean

1437.72 --> 1443.38
all right

1439.88 --> 1443.38
no whoever it is

1443.9 --> 1448.96
the whole message still stands hello by

1446.179 --> 1448.96
the way service day

1449.659 --> 1451.8400000000001
foreign

1490.299 --> 1496.48
can write English properly

1493.58 --> 1496.48
I don't know

1503.299 --> 1510.3799999999999
I guess that on average he doesn't spell

1506.779 --> 1512.72
it as bad as some others do but

1510.38 --> 1515.0590000000002
then again I think that a lot of his

1512.72 --> 1517.88
activities consist of copy pasting

1515.059 --> 1520.8999999999999
things that he pre-wrote so he doesn't

1517.88 --> 1520.9
like mess it up

1522.08 --> 1528.6399999999999
depends on his meth intake

1524.48 --> 1528.64
I don't know if he still does that

1535.34 --> 1541.76
I bet you that Shawn knows that no no

1538.46 --> 1544.159
you have no idea who this guy is service

1541.76 --> 1546.08
day this is a guy that genuinely keeps

1544.159 --> 1548.7990000000002
himself in the dark and he has done that

1546.08 --> 1548.799
for a long time

1552.679 --> 1558.74
he can't handle the Earth being flat he

1555.5 --> 1560.96
can't be a dual cosmogenist yes he is

1558.74 --> 1563.9
really that dumb

1560.96 --> 1566.5
one of the worst

1563.9 --> 1570.3400000000001
right although it doesn't make you

1566.5 --> 1570.34
automatically just dumb

1571.22 --> 1574.9
if you don't like Flat Earth

1575.179 --> 1579.3200000000002
some people just like avoid

1577.279 --> 1581.659
understanding it for a very long time

1579.32 --> 1583.34
but they they're not the anti-flatter

1581.659 --> 1585.919
others

1583.34 --> 1589.279
anti-flat Earth there's

1585.919 --> 1591.919
like they face it they face the reality

1589.279 --> 1594.1
and then they twist themselves to reject

1591.919 --> 1594.1000000000001
it

1594.58 --> 1601.52
but yeah for Sean

1597.559 --> 1604.22
that comes pretty easy apparently he

1601.52 --> 1607.48
can just wipe his own mind on the spot

1604.22 --> 1607.48
at any moment

1610.22 --> 1615.74
he forgets very easily

1612.74 --> 1618.74
like in a matter of seconds

1615.74 --> 1620.779
like where some anti-flat Earth is going

1618.74 --> 1624.08
to get on Nathan's and then they get

1620.779 --> 1626.48
held to the to the fire

1624.08 --> 1630.1399999999999
that they start to like say something

1626.48 --> 1633.26
and then immediately say the opposite

1630.14 --> 1636.88
right after that well he is kind of in

1633.26 --> 1640.8799999999999
debt pressure type of operation

1636.88 --> 1643.5200000000002
frequency almost all the time

1640.88 --> 1648.159
he gets pushed to that level very

1643.52 --> 1648.1589999999999
quickly so he just constantly messes up

1652.779 --> 1657.1
right anyway enough about him

1658.039 --> 1660.22
foreign

1706.58 --> 1709.1789999999999

2342.64 --> 2347.44
okay Rick Henry Timothy is a robot yeah

2345.28 --> 2349.78
I've been hearing that around I don't

2347.44 --> 2351.64
know if he is he's not addressing my

2349.78 --> 2354.28
question as to where he actually lives

2351.64 --> 2357.64
whether he is an American or

2354.28 --> 2360.28
or from England to try to explain his

2357.64 --> 2363.339
weird way of speaking

2360.28 --> 2364.6600000000003
would be good if he'd actually addressed

2363.339 --> 2367.96
that

2364.66 --> 2371.46
right Timothy P Southwick are you from

2367.96 --> 2371.46
Southwick in England

2375.099 --> 2378.06
where do you live

2387.7 --> 2392.8199999999997
oh not addressing it he said American

2390.339 --> 2392.82
where

2397.9 --> 2400.56
what

2402.82 --> 2408.48
oh I'm America right

2404.98 --> 2408.48
I see it now I missed that

2414.52 --> 2419.5
okay so you you have no excuse it's not

2417.339 --> 2422.46
your accent you're just

2419.5 --> 2422.46
illiterate

2435.339 --> 2438.18
ah

2456.88 --> 2463.359
yeah yeah Timothy the thing is

2460.599 --> 2467.1400000000003
you have to actually read what you wrote

2463.359 --> 2469.24
down before you press enter you see

2467.14 --> 2471.0989999999997
and not just blurt something out and

2469.24 --> 2472.5989999999997
then hope that it says what you were

2471.099 --> 2474.579
saying what you were trying to say you

2472.599 --> 2477.2200000000003
have to actually check what you're

2474.579 --> 2479.02
saying and yeah you might wanna if

2477.22 --> 2482.02
you're like having some mobile interface

2479.02 --> 2484.839
you might want to turn off auto correct

2482.02 --> 2486.819
like instant auto correct I mean it's

2484.839 --> 2488.44
handy to like see like a red line

2486.819 --> 2490.06
underneath if you spelled it wrong

2488.44 --> 2491.5
according to this

2490.06 --> 2494.2
a certain

2491.5 --> 2497.14
language set

2494.2 --> 2502.14
but don't have the letters automatically

2497.14 --> 2505.48
fill in it's notoriously the worst

2502.14 --> 2508.24
communication thing ever

2505.48 --> 2510.88
since the 90s that [ __ ]

2508.24 --> 2512.859
auto fill in the words it's terrible

2510.88 --> 2515.98
it's so terrible

2512.859 --> 2518.619
that even like mainstream

2515.98 --> 2521.859
comedy shows and [ __ ]

2518.619 --> 2525.339
TV shows like

2521.859 --> 2528.0989999999997
talk about how stupid that works never

2525.339 --> 2530.92
use that it just makes you look like an

2528.099 --> 2534.04
idiot doesn't help you learn spelling

2530.92 --> 2537.099
doesn't help you pay more attention

2534.04 --> 2539.88
turn it off and just actually look at

2537.099 --> 2539.88
what you're typing

2557.619 --> 2563.76
no spell check on okay well I guess then

2560.619 --> 2563.76
you're just sloppy

2570.76 --> 2574.78
sue me really

2574.8 --> 2578.5
silly

2576.579 --> 2582.6600000000003
uh

2578.5 --> 2582.66
look I find it disruptive

2592.72 --> 2597.7599999999998
you can't spell

2594.94 --> 2599.859
well have you ever considered learning

2597.76 --> 2601.5400000000004
how to spell have you ever considered

2599.859 --> 2605.22
just like

2601.54 --> 2605.22
brushing up your literacy

2621.579 --> 2623.76
foreign

2629.7 --> 2633.1189999999997
speech to text

2633.4 --> 2637.859
maybe that'll help no guarantee though

2639.099 --> 2642.7200000000003
no steamy trailers

2649.54 --> 2654.72
is it true you lose empathy after second

2652.3 --> 2654.7200000000003
Jab

2655.78 --> 2661.5400000000004
maybe maybe for some

2658.839 --> 2663.7599999999998
but like you don't know if it's

2661.54 --> 2664.839
permanent

2663.76 --> 2666.94
right

2664.839 --> 2669.819
like the

2666.94 --> 2672.76
it might indeed have like a severely

2669.819 --> 2675.04
suppressing influence

2672.76 --> 2678.3590000000004
causing your body to be preoccupied

2675.04 --> 2680.68
going to like a lesser mode of operation

2678.359 --> 2683.2
that will

2680.68 --> 2685.839
take away kind of the luxury of having

2683.2 --> 2688.72
empathy and being able to deal with the

2685.839 --> 2691.18
results that come in through empathy

2688.72 --> 2694.839
so yeah it might be temporarily turned

2691.18 --> 2698.46
off but permanently I don't know

2694.839 --> 2698.46
like time will tell

2700.839 --> 2707.14
but I think that a lot of the empathy

2703.839 --> 2709.54
loss and like just draw going on like a

2707.14 --> 2712.0
drone because of the v's

2709.54 --> 2713.68
it has more to do with really the choice

2712.0 --> 2715.48
it's like

2713.68 --> 2718.72
like

2715.48 --> 2720.46
no longer fighting the system and just

2718.72 --> 2722.3799999999997
becoming a part of it and then when you

2720.46 --> 2725.38
make that choice

2722.38 --> 2728.319
then every reminder

2725.38 --> 2731.1400000000003
about basically the choice you make is

2728.319 --> 2733.839
going to be annoying and painful so you

2731.14 --> 2737.4
will guess get less empathetic

2733.839 --> 2737.4
because you don't want to know about it

2737.8 --> 2742.42
because it makes you feel guilty or

2740.2 --> 2744.0989999999997
stupid or whatever

2742.42 --> 2747.52
that could also be a reason the reason

2744.099 --> 2749.5
can simply be psychological to claim a

2747.52 --> 2751.859
clinical suppression of the empathy

2749.5 --> 2751.859
ability

2752.619 --> 2757.1800000000003
is a bit of a stretch

2755.859 --> 2758.7999999999997
at least if you're going to claim it's

2757.18 --> 2761.68
permanent right there might be a

2758.8 --> 2764.3390000000004
temporary suppression effect due to

2761.68 --> 2767.319
poison poisonous

2764.339 --> 2768.7
influence of the V

2767.319 --> 2770.74
but to

2768.7 --> 2773.4399999999996
to stated that

2770.74 --> 2774.5789999999997
it's going to be permanent that yeah

2773.44 --> 2778.7400000000002
that's a

2774.579 --> 2778.7400000000002
that might be a leap too far

2783.7 --> 2788.859
and besides like if you literally

2786.28 --> 2791.4
suddenly have like certain parts of your

2788.859 --> 2794.0789999999997
personality

2791.4 --> 2797.88
deactivated permanently

2794.079 --> 2797.88
that's very dangerous

2800.079 --> 2805.7200000000003
like you could literally go insane

2803.079 --> 2809.079
because of that

2805.72 --> 2811.0
if suddenly like the the spectrum of

2809.079 --> 2813.04
your character it comes becomes

2811.0 --> 2814.119
completely different and you can't get

2813.04 --> 2815.5
it back

2814.119 --> 2818.38
that's

2815.5 --> 2820.98
terrible experience

2818.38 --> 2820.98
terrible

2821.2 --> 2826.8999999999996
you're gonna go into Escapist mode

2824.38 --> 2828.88
because just the realization of what

2826.9 --> 2831.7200000000003
then happened is

2828.88 --> 2831.7200000000003
horrific

2834.7 --> 2840.2799999999997
but

2836.92 --> 2842.7400000000002
I don't know I don't think that

2840.28 --> 2844.96
it's not Universal anyway it's not like

2842.74 --> 2846.8799999999997
oh you take a V and you automatically

2844.96 --> 2848.92
lose all empathy no

2846.88 --> 2851.6400000000003
not because of the the chemical

2848.92 --> 2855.099
influence that seems just unlikely

2851.64 --> 2860.0989999999997
because then like it would really start

2855.099 --> 2860.099
the show like really start the show

2861.4 --> 2866.339
I think it's more about the psychology

2863.559 --> 2866.3390000000004
behind it

2867.099 --> 2873.2200000000003
it's more likely right tensions are high

2870.7 --> 2875.74
if you then make a choice that involve

2873.22 --> 2878.4399999999996
that tension it's going to change your

2875.74 --> 2880.9599999999996
your attitude the way you approach the

2878.44 --> 2885.48
world psychologically I think that's

2880.96 --> 2885.48
more likely that Ned's actual chemical

2887.44 --> 2895.96
direct suppression or like the damaging

2892.42 --> 2899.44
of the mind or the brain

2895.96 --> 2902.98
but yeah don't know you'll find out

2899.44 --> 2905.02
afterward like as in those that survive

2902.98 --> 2907.78
on on the long run there will be some

2905.02 --> 2910.96
perhaps

2907.78 --> 2913.42
will they all show like yeah

2910.96 --> 2915.819
I'm not who I used to be I just don't

2913.42 --> 2918.2200000000003
have any more feelings now

2915.819 --> 2920.5
about this and that and that that really

2918.22 --> 2922.0589999999997
becomes a thing like a syndrome like

2920.5 --> 2924.46
yeah all these people that took the V

2922.059 --> 2925.5400000000004
they all have that right then you got a

2924.46 --> 2928.0
case

2925.54 --> 2930.9
but that's long term

2928.0 --> 2934.9
because on the short term

2930.9 --> 2937.3
these of all kinds with like because all

2934.9 --> 2940.3
of them kind of are toxic in ways

2937.3 --> 2943.42
especially like the

2940.3 --> 2944.26
the newer ones that are concocted in the

2943.42 --> 2947.02
flu

2944.26 --> 2949.7200000000003
these before all this

2947.02 --> 2951.7599999999998
like the toxic influence can literally

2949.72 --> 2954.64
just suppress

2951.76 --> 2956.8
experience like take your entire

2954.64 --> 2959.0789999999997
Consciousness a ladder down and it's

2956.8 --> 2962.6400000000003
also part of the social engineering

2959.079 --> 2962.6400000000003
function of the vs

2962.74 --> 2969.18
but that's temporary

2965.8 --> 2969.1800000000003
you recover from that

2988.0 --> 2990.66
what

2991.48 --> 2997.98
remember those books and links I tried

2994.42 --> 2997.98
to share no I don't

2998.02 --> 3001.92
flag one

2999.76 --> 3005.28
no

3001.92 --> 3007.92
look if I don't know you

3005.28 --> 3008.76
and you just start to post links in my

3007.92 --> 3013.26
chat

3008.76 --> 3015.6600000000003
or in my comment section I delete them

3013.26 --> 3018.96
because people for a long time have kind

3015.66 --> 3021.0589999999997
of been trying to use my platform to

3018.96 --> 3023.819
advertise for [ __ ]

3021.059 --> 3026.599
so I always end up deleting that unless

3023.819 --> 3026.599
I know you

3045.96 --> 3048.54
that service day I thought you were

3047.64 --> 3051.0589999999997
gonna

3048.54 --> 3053.22
get to work you still be see hanging

3051.059 --> 3054.0
you're you still seem to be hanging

3053.22 --> 3057.5589999999997
around

3054.0 --> 3057.559
not that I mind though but

3064.2 --> 3070.2799999999997
reminds me of the film equilibrium yeah

3066.359 --> 3070.2799999999997
Joseph three six nine yeah

3070.5 --> 3077.599
equilibrium is a really good example

3074.819 --> 3077.599
of that

3079.44 --> 3083.76
of how

3080.88 --> 3086.28
yeah injections and [ __ ]

3083.76 --> 3089.4
or certain medications can temporarily

3086.28 --> 3091.92
suppress you in a way Soma from Brave

3089.4 --> 3094.88
New World is like that too but it's

3091.92 --> 3094.88
always temporary

3097.02 --> 3103.74
like in Brave New World they don't just

3100.44 --> 3105.78
go in and like have mandatory brain

3103.74 --> 3107.4599999999996
surgeon on everybody

3105.78 --> 3109.7000000000003
right

3107.46 --> 3112.2
even though they're already manipulating

3109.7 --> 3114.2999999999997
through genetic engineering and

3112.2 --> 3116.7
conditioning

3114.3 --> 3121.02
and like they do kind of like I guess

3116.7 --> 3124.0789999999997
like the lower class the dwarves what is

3121.02 --> 3126.42
it the the lowest class they kind of

3124.079 --> 3129.3
like electro shock them out of certain

3126.42 --> 3130.5
impulses so

3129.3 --> 3133.02
but

3130.5 --> 3137.22
like they don't like literally just

3133.02 --> 3139.68
lobotomize everybody permanently

3137.22 --> 3143.24
just make you dependent on the drug to

3139.68 --> 3143.24
suppress and all that right so

3144.42 --> 3152.2200000000003
yeah okay yeah that's fine Timothy P

3147.48 --> 3154.5
Southwick yeah I I don't care

3152.22 --> 3157.4599999999996
I don't remember your links and all that

3154.5 --> 3157.46
from way back

3161.579 --> 3167.52
and I probably deleted them

3164.76 --> 3169.38
or I just thought they were [ __ ] that's

3167.52 --> 3172.16
also a possibility and then that's a

3169.38 --> 3172.1600000000003
good reason to forget

3179.72 --> 3183.74
no what the hell

3187.859 --> 3194.04
who never looked okay so are you gonna

3191.76 --> 3197.059
stop whining about that now or am I

3194.04 --> 3197.0589999999997
gonna time you out

3225.599 --> 3229.339
all right service day see you later

3244.44 --> 3248.96
are you drinking today green tea as

3246.66 --> 3248.96
usual

3257.94 --> 3263.88
my show seems to be a magnet for strange

3260.7 --> 3265.98
but yeah catch inspector I know

3263.88 --> 3268.2000000000003
but that's been it's been like that from

3265.98 --> 3269.94
the start like on average when I really

3268.2 --> 3272.22
just started up my channel that the

3269.94 --> 3275.2200000000003
flatter talks

3272.22 --> 3278.4599999999996
I had like a lot of like really really

3275.22 --> 3281.2799999999997
weirdos in there

3278.46 --> 3283.799
but maybe it's also because I kind of

3281.28 --> 3286.0400000000004
felt like a really really weirdo back

3283.799 --> 3286.04
then

3286.88 --> 3294.2000000000003
felt very nervous and awkward and

3291.48 --> 3294.2
different

3304.5 --> 3308.119
yeah yeah that's not helping

3324.9 --> 3330.78
I don't feel like that anymore Bad Karma

3327.72 --> 3332.7
hello no I don't

3330.78 --> 3336.0
not like that

3332.7 --> 3338.7
I mean I realize that

3336.0 --> 3340.94
compared to the average person I am

3338.7 --> 3340.9399999999996
different

3341.28 --> 3345.02
but I don't feel awkward anymore

3346.92 --> 3350.88
I mean

3348.2 --> 3352.74
everybody's gotten like five years now

3350.88 --> 3355.26
to get used to me

3352.74 --> 3357.4199999999996
and I've gotten a lot more looking

3355.26 --> 3359.2200000000003
around

3357.42 --> 3362.099
I've done that a lot

3359.22 --> 3364.9199999999996
and I realized like yeah I'm not like

3362.099 --> 3368.1800000000003
the craziest of people out there and

3364.92 --> 3368.1800000000003
there's actually some that

3369.119 --> 3376.099
that can sort of halfway follow my

3372.18 --> 3376.0989999999997
really Niche ideas

3377.04 --> 3380.4
like

3378.24 --> 3382.4399999999996
part of the reason why I even felt so

3380.4 --> 3384.42
weird is like yeah

3382.44 --> 3386.76
the sun is holographic the sun is

3384.42 --> 3388.619
holographic well I felt like a total PJ

3386.76 --> 3390.78
back then because of that even though I

3388.619 --> 3393.1800000000003
knew I was onto something

3390.78 --> 3395.1600000000003
but everybody kind of was like well yeah

3393.18 --> 3396.54
we don't know what to think about that

3395.16 --> 3398.339
guy

3396.54 --> 3400.2
and there might still be people out

3398.339 --> 3403.94
there that have that

3400.2 --> 3403.9399999999996
still don't know what to think about me

3404.46 --> 3408.299
sometimes I don't know what to think

3406.14 --> 3410.7
about me

3408.299 --> 3414.619
and then I remember it's no use really

3410.7 --> 3414.6189999999997
pondering on that

3414.72 --> 3418.5789999999997
follow the principles keep going

3419.04 --> 3424.94
and make sure you're always doing

3420.9 --> 3424.94
something productive in some way

3427.38 --> 3432.119
hey moth eyes

3429.72 --> 3434.72
long time no see

3432.119 --> 3434.7200000000003
Clary

3455.22 --> 3462.839
right so yeah I don't really feel

3458.28 --> 3465.2400000000002
awkward and like like I'm a crazy person

3462.839 --> 3467.94
I don't feel like that anymore

3465.24 --> 3469.2
it's rather like yeah everybody can get

3467.94 --> 3471.7200000000003
a little crazy

3469.2 --> 3473.9399999999996
I happen to be taking like a big scoop

3471.72 --> 3476.839
of it even when I was very young because

3473.94 --> 3476.839
it was basically

3476.88 --> 3480.96
told to me

3478.68 --> 3484.14
by my parents and yeah they should know

3480.96 --> 3487.619
especially my mother like yeah

3484.14 --> 3489.96
people that are crazy and eccentric

3487.619 --> 3491.76
are often like that as a side effect

3489.96 --> 3493.44
because they're freaking brilliant and

3491.76 --> 3495.38
they don't know what to do with it

3493.44 --> 3499.26
because the world

3495.38 --> 3501.92
is like incompatible to them

3499.26 --> 3501.92
yeah

3502.079 --> 3508.079
so I was basically encouraged just like

3504.96 --> 3512.359
be expressive even if you think that

3508.079 --> 3512.3590000000004
it's kind of weird to others

3517.68 --> 3522.5989999999997
all right unfortunately during that it

3520.5 --> 3526.859
was still all kind of liberal

3522.599 --> 3528.42
uh there was some basic morality on top

3526.859 --> 3532.5789999999997
of that

3528.42 --> 3532.579
but not very structured

3543.24 --> 3545.839
right

3547.44 --> 3550.64
now it's a lot better

3552.359 --> 3558.5989999999997
now I I got my compass straight now I

3555.24 --> 3561.54
finally got my bearing by having it all

3558.599 --> 3564.3590000000004
in a giant image in my head

3561.54 --> 3567.54
like everything how I was

3564.359 --> 3570.42
our wife changed

3567.54 --> 3574.02
I've solved a lot of questions that were

3570.42 --> 3577.14
weighing heavily upon me in my youth

3574.02 --> 3579.66
that I asked very young and then held on

3577.14 --> 3582.18
to it not just like oh I gotta what

3579.66 --> 3584.339
about this and then oh just forget about

3582.18 --> 3585.66
it

3584.339 --> 3588.0
no

3585.66 --> 3589.5589999999997
I wouldn't forget about it I would let

3588.0 --> 3593.52
it weigh on me

3589.559 --> 3595.92
because I just really wanted to know

3593.52 --> 3599.24
I wanted to know things that other

3595.92 --> 3599.2400000000002
people tried to avoid

3611.819 --> 3616.71
yeah dude I'm not even faced by that

3614.4 --> 3618.0
that's just

3616.71 --> 3621.0
[Music]

3618.0 --> 3621.0
boring

3632.88 --> 3638.7200000000003
a one photo unit

3634.98 --> 3638.72
man I got a full chat today

3661.98 --> 3665.64
coming to a supermarket are you sure

3664.5 --> 3668.46
about that

3665.64 --> 3670.68
seeking star water I think that every

3668.46 --> 3674.339
freaking company that's going along with

3670.68 --> 3677.0989999999997
this crazy v-bass and all that they're

3674.339 --> 3679.74
all gonna go bust all of them

3677.099 --> 3681.2400000000002
yeah big companies

3679.74 --> 3684.24
they're all gonna go bust because

3681.24 --> 3686.52
literally they're going to be empty

3684.24 --> 3689.2799999999997
they might still have stock and all that

3686.52 --> 3691.14
but they're gonna remain very empty

3689.28 --> 3693.5400000000004
because just

3691.14 --> 3698.4
nobody's gonna go along with it

3693.54 --> 3700.079
and those that do end up dying

3698.4 --> 3702.079
yeah

3700.079 --> 3702.079
yeah

3703.38 --> 3706.539
[Applause]

3708.119 --> 3713.2200000000003
right so

3710.579 --> 3716.2200000000003
you have to have this special passport

3713.22 --> 3719.48
to get in the store or you could just

3716.22 --> 3719.48
go to a farmer

3720.42 --> 3725.48
they're not gonna ask you for a freaking

3722.52 --> 3725.48
V passport

3726.119 --> 3731.1600000000003
all pharmacies for sure yeah well okay

3728.099 --> 3733.44
well yeah well if you

3731.16 --> 3734.94
are dependent on that you already have a

3733.44 --> 3737.46
problem by the way

3734.94 --> 3738.48
not necessarily though because a lot of

3737.46 --> 3741.059
them

3738.48 --> 3744.78
even do like

3741.059 --> 3746.2200000000003
drugs over the mail they just send it to

3744.78 --> 3748.1400000000003
you right

3746.22 --> 3751.74
there's no way they're ever gonna

3748.14 --> 3754.5589999999997
like demand you have some kind of V

3751.74 --> 3757.859
designation in order to do that it's

3754.559 --> 3761.6400000000003
always about going to a place

3757.859 --> 3764.24
right it's not just like oh you're not

3761.64 --> 3767.46
you're not registered to be

3764.24 --> 3769.859
vaccinated so we're literally not doing

3767.46 --> 3771.299
business with you that would be a whole

3769.859 --> 3773.5789999999997
nother level

3771.299 --> 3775.559
if they if they even start to refuse

3773.579 --> 3780.02
sending you things on the mail then now

3775.559 --> 3780.02
then it's gonna get seriously [ __ ] up

3785.16 --> 3791.3999999999996
and it might happen eventually right

3787.579 --> 3793.799
dude just imagine how bad it can be it's

3791.4 --> 3796.14
gonna be that bad and worse every single

3793.799 --> 3798.24
time every single time it's gonna go Way

3796.14 --> 3802.3799999999997
Beyond where you would like to imagine

3798.24 --> 3803.7599999999998
it's gonna go okay Way Beyond it that's

3802.38 --> 3806.6400000000003
why I've been calling for a while now

3803.76 --> 3808.0200000000004
like yeah why is everybody just letting

3806.64 --> 3810.48
this happen

3808.02 --> 3812.579
when you know it's gonna become the

3810.48 --> 3816.42
worst imaginable

3812.579 --> 3818.7200000000003
and if beyond that like the death of all

3816.42 --> 3818.7200000000003
things

3818.76 --> 3822.8390000000004
so

3820.44 --> 3825.7200000000003
that's why I've been like yeah I don't I

3822.839 --> 3827.4
don't know why people are still like oh

3825.72 --> 3830.339
we can't

3827.4 --> 3832.14
we can't fall in that trap of springing

3830.339 --> 3836.88
into like actually we just have to

3832.14 --> 3839.7
protest that's it right well yeah that

3836.88 --> 3843.1400000000003
Fail-Safe mechanism

3839.7 --> 3843.14
they're using that

3843.42 --> 3850.14
these new world order planners they've

3846.359 --> 3852.299
used that to imprison you with your own

3850.14 --> 3853.92
passivity

3852.299 --> 3857.28
with your

3853.92 --> 3859.92
lack of will to actually go there

3857.28 --> 3861.6600000000003
they bred and condition all the

3859.92 --> 3864.48
aggression out of it

3861.66 --> 3866.22
nobody dares now to take a risk anymore

3864.48 --> 3867.839
they're all too afraid to lose

3866.22 --> 3870.1189999999997
everything

3867.839 --> 3873.24
right because that can happen when

3870.119 --> 3875.4
there's actual like you take back your

3873.24 --> 3880.14
government or take back a court system

3875.4 --> 3884.599
like with people and guns yeah people

3880.14 --> 3884.5989999999997
are probably gonna die it's very risky

3885.24 --> 3889.319
it's gonna be messed up one way or

3887.16 --> 3890.3999999999996
another but yeah what's the alternative

3889.319 --> 3893.88
you know

3890.4 --> 3896.819
that's why I've been like pretty forward

3893.88 --> 3900.1800000000003
like yeah I'm sick of this passivity

3896.819 --> 3902.46
[ __ ] I'm I'm like I don't understand why

3900.18 --> 3904.2
people aren't just like going berserk

3902.46 --> 3907.44
and just

3904.2 --> 3910.52
dragging people out of their houses

3907.44 --> 3915.119
and I'm not don't mean like stupid

3910.52 --> 3918.839
controlled antifa numpty zombies

3915.119 --> 3921.0
funded by by satanic Bankers no I mean

3918.839 --> 3922.619
just the regular people that actually do

3921.0 --> 3925.319
just want to live their life and they

3922.619 --> 3927.059
want to be left alone I don't understand

3925.319 --> 3929.94
why they're not why they're all just

3927.059 --> 3933.3590000000004
thinking oh we could just hang in there

3929.94 --> 3934.859
when they know it's gonna grow worse and

3933.359 --> 3938.7
worse and worse

3934.859 --> 3941.0989999999997
until you're so weakened that you cannot

3938.7 --> 3944.46
do it anymore

3941.099 --> 3947.0
and that's a guarantee

3944.46 --> 3947.0
right

3948.359 --> 3954.0
might sound very unpopular maybe crazy

3951.18 --> 3955.68
maybe I'm like oh I'm inserting violent

3954.0 --> 3958.98
yeah well at some point you freaking

3955.68 --> 3960.24
need to at some point it's done it's

3958.98 --> 3963.359
over

3960.24 --> 3966.0589999999997
social contracts are broken you gotta do

3963.359 --> 3967.98
something about it you gotta step out of

3966.059 --> 3970.7400000000002
that societal

3967.98 --> 3973.26
protection blanket because they're

3970.74 --> 3976.02
counting on it they're counting on you

3973.26 --> 3977.2200000000003
taking cover under that blanket

3976.02 --> 3979.619
right

3977.22 --> 3981.66
you could almost lay the metaphor just

3979.619 --> 3984.48
let they're bringing us blankets oh

3981.66 --> 3987.5389999999998
guess what's gonna happen

3984.48 --> 3989.64
you think it's safe to just take refuge

3987.539 --> 3991.44
under those blankets think that they're

3989.64 --> 3992.7599999999998
gonna stop

3991.44 --> 3994.7400000000002
no

3992.76 --> 3996.9
no they're counting on it they're

3994.74 --> 4001.2799999999997
counting on your passivity

3996.9 --> 4003.26
and your unwillingness to let go of

4001.28 --> 4005.6600000000003
all the gains and all the little things

4003.26 --> 4008.0
and advantages that a society in general

4005.66 --> 4011.02
brings

4008.0 --> 4011.02
that's what I think

4014.839 --> 4020.299
like I've been ready for like

4018.319 --> 4022.4
some kind of a revolution for a while

4020.299 --> 4023.599
now but yeah I can't do it just on my

4022.4 --> 4026.299
own

4023.599 --> 4028.52
and I don't necessarily want to do that

4026.299 --> 4030.74
it's just that it's my general advice

4028.52 --> 4032.9
like this is gonna go

4030.74 --> 4035.4799999999996
crash

4032.9 --> 4038.359
and by the time

4035.48 --> 4040.039
like if you're just used to like just

4038.359 --> 4044.42
hold in there just hold in there we'll

4040.039 --> 4046.46
pull through at some point you want

4044.42 --> 4048.92
because they're not gonna stop this

4046.46 --> 4051.7400000000002
setting that allows you to do that is

4048.92 --> 4054.02
going to end they're gonna come they

4051.74 --> 4055.5789999999997
will come after you they're just not

4054.02 --> 4058.579
doing it now they're just threatening

4055.579 --> 4060.819
now at some point they will actually do

4058.579 --> 4060.819
that

4060.98 --> 4065.78
they will do it

4062.66 --> 4067.94
and are you still gonna have the nerves

4065.78 --> 4070.6400000000003
the balls left the wheel left to

4067.94 --> 4072.98
actually respond to it then when it will

4070.64 --> 4074.96
seem very much like it's the end and

4072.98 --> 4078.92
there's nothing more you can do or are

4074.96 --> 4080.839
you gonna not let it get to that point

4078.92 --> 4084.52
and actually

4080.839 --> 4084.52
take some initiative

4088.52 --> 4094.96
and actually just go after the open

4092.18 --> 4094.96
criminals

4102.259 --> 4107.179
what do I do about it myself well I

4104.96 --> 4109.159
speak out I speak out

4107.179 --> 4112.1
and try to stop

4109.159 --> 4113.3589999999995
what I perceive as a bad tactical

4112.1 --> 4115.6990000000005
decision

4113.359 --> 4119.42
oh we're gonna keep it peaceful I just

4115.699 --> 4121.159
keep demonstrating uh yeah no

4119.42 --> 4123.62
it's already being proven it's not

4121.159 --> 4126.44
helping they're still doing it

4123.62 --> 4127.94
just lying to your faces

4126.44 --> 4129.678999999999
they're just bullshitting their way

4127.94 --> 4133.5199999999995
through they're not gonna stop it's only

4129.679 --> 4136.279
gonna grow worse you know it is

4133.52 --> 4138.679
they cannot do it any other way and

4136.279 --> 4142.159000000001
they've gone for broke

4138.679 --> 4144.4400000000005
they will keep going until like it's

4142.159 --> 4147.92
over

4144.44 --> 4149.299
so yeah taking that into mind you might

4147.92 --> 4153.02
want to actually

4149.299 --> 4155.12
formulate a viable counter response

4153.02 --> 4157.540000000001
instead of trying to weight everything

4155.12 --> 4157.54
out

4169.819 --> 4174.279
right

4172.219 --> 4174.279
like

4175.279 --> 4182.179
I'd see it as an invasion like it is

4179.179 --> 4183.56
actually an invasion oh oh there they're

4182.179 --> 4185.719
officials

4183.56 --> 4188.2390000000005
they have the uniforms of the country

4185.719 --> 4191.359
well they are acting like Invaders and

4188.239 --> 4193.699
they're taking camouflage

4191.359 --> 4195.9800000000005
so as soon as they fall outside of like

4193.699 --> 4198.678999999999
constitutional rules

4195.98 --> 4201.139999999999
a police officer certainly isn't a

4198.679 --> 4204.82
police officer anymore they're now a

4201.14 --> 4204.820000000001
criminal Thug Enforcer

4208.28 --> 4213.219
and that's how I will see them if I

4210.44 --> 4213.219
notice that happens

4215.9 --> 4221.48
not I haven't seen that so far over here

4218.6 --> 4223.58
like in my direction you get the

4221.48 --> 4226.159
messages on the news and oh look at this

4223.58 --> 4229.1
outrageous situation yeah I haven't seen

4226.159 --> 4231.139999999999
that in person very happy about that

4229.1 --> 4233.54
I am Vigilant to it like if the police

4231.14 --> 4236.2390000000005
suddenly start like

4233.54 --> 4240.199
trying to

4236.239 --> 4243.62
treat people like cattle and all that

4240.199 --> 4245.54
and really enforce the mandates or

4243.62 --> 4248.0599999999995
whatever it's going to be yeah

4245.54 --> 4250.94
they're no longer police

4248.06 --> 4254.84
and a pretty

4250.94 --> 4257.0
sure that like the police in Australia

4254.84 --> 4260.4800000000005
in the certain regions Victoria Sydney

4257.0 --> 4262.94
all that they're not police officers

4260.48 --> 4264.44
they're taking camouflage under that

4262.94 --> 4266.259999999999
function

4264.44 --> 4269.54
but they're not

4266.26 --> 4271.1
their Criminal enforcers

4269.54 --> 4275.12
they're like a

4271.1 --> 4277.400000000001
a hired mercenary Thug Army

4275.12 --> 4279.98
that have infiltrated the police system

4277.4 --> 4282.0199999999995
and then uncloaked

4279.98 --> 4285.259999999999
taking power

4282.02 --> 4286.76
they're not police officers anymore

4285.26 --> 4288.26
just because they're wearing that

4286.76 --> 4291.4400000000005
uniform doesn't mean they're police

4288.26 --> 4294.820000000001
officers they're criminal enforcers and

4291.44 --> 4294.82
they should be treated as such

4297.62 --> 4302.96
if you're a police officer

4300.199 --> 4305.659
then it's your duty to uphold the

4302.96 --> 4308.7390000000005
Constitution no matter what

4305.659 --> 4312.739
and the Constitution does not include

4308.739 --> 4315.739
some virtual medical threat

4312.739 --> 4318.44
that's horseshit

4315.739 --> 4321.08
that's not their function that shouldn't

4318.44 --> 4323.48
be their function ever

4321.08 --> 4326.0
police should not be involved in such

4323.48 --> 4328.218999999999
things at all ever

4326.0 --> 4330.32
it's none of their freaking business

4328.219 --> 4334.179
it's nobody's business

4330.32 --> 4334.179
it's barely the government's business

4358.6 --> 4365.4400000000005
right and I think that worldwide there

4362.36 --> 4365.44
should be like a

4365.84 --> 4368.5
like

4368.86 --> 4376.46
inspired on how for example Putin in

4372.38 --> 4380.2390000000005
Russia has dealt with ngos right

4376.46 --> 4382.28
like taking hostile Financial operations

4380.239 --> 4385.099999999999
down

4382.28 --> 4387.62
when they don't have like the locals

4385.1 --> 4388.88
best interest at heart

4387.62 --> 4392.659
plant

4388.88 --> 4395.6
like you could literally figure that out

4392.659 --> 4397.219
I think that should be done worldwide

4395.6 --> 4399.38
yeah that's going to be in the end of

4397.219 --> 4402.1
globalism in many ways of that

4399.38 --> 4402.1
conspiracy

4402.62 --> 4409.76
it's like the ability to just

4406.6 --> 4412.04
hostily Finance share some project

4409.76 --> 4415.820000000001
that's not in the best interest of the

4412.04 --> 4418.219
people should be forbidden

4415.82 --> 4421.639999999999
entirely

4418.219 --> 4424.179
as in oh that's happening well send an

4421.64 --> 4424.179
arrest team

4424.4 --> 4427.299999999999
immediately

4440.96 --> 4447.199
I don't know but it's just an idea

4445.46 --> 4450.26
right if you just leave those

4447.199 --> 4453.32
organizations do their creepy social

4450.26 --> 4454.820000000001
engineering [ __ ] and all that it's all

4453.32 --> 4457.34
gonna get worse and they're gonna get

4454.82 --> 4460.28
more people are slavishly on their side

4457.34 --> 4464.06
eventually even to defend doing that

4460.28 --> 4466.04
until you end up in a country filled

4464.06 --> 4468.38
with a whole bunch of people that have

4466.04 --> 4472.64
been indoctrinated to literally become

4468.38 --> 4476.38
obsessed destroying the country

4472.64 --> 4476.38
is that what you want to have happen

4487.58 --> 4491.5599999999995
right so that's my attitude

4492.46 --> 4496.96
intolerance hashtag intolerance

4499.58 --> 4505.699
right I remember a time when

4502.219 --> 4509.62
corruption was like like really a bad

4505.699 --> 4509.62
thing like it scared people

4510.56 --> 4515.0
when people in government and all that

4512.9 --> 4517.58
like the corrupt

4515.0 --> 4519.26
or they lied they were proven to lie it

4517.58 --> 4520.699
was a big issue they would get fired

4519.26 --> 4523.159000000001
from their function because of that

4520.699 --> 4526.0599999999995
sometimes even like

4523.159 --> 4526.0599999999995
go through Court

4526.1 --> 4532.159000000001
well

4528.44 --> 4535.46
then that stopped the media stopped

4532.159 --> 4537.739
backing that trend of doing that because

4535.46 --> 4539.3
the media back then kind of was on to

4537.739 --> 4542.299999999999
that typically like they would go like

4539.3 --> 4545.0
are these corrupt go after him then it

4542.3 --> 4547.9400000000005
all became polarized into like a

4545.0 --> 4549.62
political system including the media and

4547.94 --> 4551.419999999999
now they don't do that anymore with

4549.62 --> 4555.44
people that are blatantly corrupt

4551.42 --> 4558.76
because they're on their party side on

4555.44 --> 4561.86
their conspiracy party side

4558.76 --> 4563.179
and the people are just letting that

4561.86 --> 4565.78
happen

4563.179 --> 4565.78
like

4566.48 --> 4571.28
when before if

4568.94 --> 4574.04
if the media would like call that out

4571.28 --> 4576.82
they would get like Furious and riots

4574.04 --> 4576.82
sometimes even

4577.94 --> 4582.799999999999
it's crazy

4580.46 --> 4585.56
like you really have to have a talking

4582.8 --> 4588.320000000001
head somewhere on the screen

4585.56 --> 4590.0
to tell you to get outraged and riot in

4588.32 --> 4591.259999999999
order to do that you're just not gonna

4590.0 --> 4594.4
do it

4591.26 --> 4594.400000000001
yourself anymore

4594.62 --> 4600.08
it just like oh he's corrupt but he's on

4597.26 --> 4602.900000000001
Earth you're gonna buy that he's corrupt

4600.08 --> 4604.82
but he's on our side when is that ever a

4602.9 --> 4606.32
legitimate statement

4604.82 --> 4609.92
just think about it

4606.32 --> 4613.099999999999
he is corrupt he or she

4609.92 --> 4618.02
but it's okay because they're on our

4613.1 --> 4620.719
side that's freaking lunacy

4618.02 --> 4625.659000000001
somebody that's corrupt is never really

4620.719 --> 4625.659
on your side because they're corrupt

4632.42 --> 4637.76
media is a big part of the pro yes I

4635.0 --> 4639.8
agree I just I just laid that out like

4637.76 --> 4641.4800000000005
how that all changed the media used to

4639.8 --> 4643.76
be like

4641.48 --> 4646.879999999999
the the fraction

4643.76 --> 4649.159000000001
in society that would go after that

4646.88 --> 4651.679
and they would even successfully take

4649.159 --> 4655.4
down people in government because of it

4651.679 --> 4658.54
now they stop doing it it's just they

4655.4 --> 4662.36
only whine towards

4658.54 --> 4665.48
perceived political party members of

4662.36 --> 4668.12
some opposing thing

4665.48 --> 4670.58
that's it they they're all politicized

4668.12 --> 4673.78
they're not journalists anymore they're

4670.58 --> 4673.78
political agents now

4674.54 --> 4680.659
most of it the mainstream at least

4678.44 --> 4682.82
I mean they're still like

4680.659 --> 4684.62
kind of independent journalists and

4682.82 --> 4688.719
alternative sectors

4684.62 --> 4688.719
but they they don't really

4689.48 --> 4693.32
yeah well there's actually plenty of

4691.58 --> 4696.159
them but they don't really get a lot of

4693.32 --> 4698.78
attention they're being pushed out

4696.159 --> 4700.94
politically because they're not Towing

4698.78 --> 4703.94
the party line they're not accepting and

4700.94 --> 4708.5
condoning the corruption of people on

4703.94 --> 4712.639999999999
their side you see so yeah it's all gone

4708.5 --> 4716.679
to [ __ ] and media is a big part of that

4712.64 --> 4716.679
really big part they switched

4716.9 --> 4722.239
from a journalistic function to take

4719.6 --> 4725.96
down corruption towards becoming

4722.239 --> 4728.36
political mind controlling agents to

4725.96 --> 4732.34
tell everybody what is good and what

4728.36 --> 4732.339999999999
isn't based on political power

4732.739 --> 4738.58
and that's

4734.719 --> 4738.58
a really bad transition

4746.44 --> 4752.139999999999
right anyway I'll be back in two minutes

4749.9 --> 4752.139999999999
foreign

4808.34 --> 4810.52
thank you

4846.199 --> 4848.379999999999
foreign

4884.84 --> 4887.679
right

4902.719 --> 4907.88
Hitler did it with radios in the 1933

4906.679 --> 4910.9400000000005
right

4907.88 --> 4913.159000000001
yeah it is all very hilarian like the

4910.94 --> 4917.138999999999
New World Order what's going on right

4913.159 --> 4917.138999999999
now it's all very hitlerian

4920.239 --> 4924.98
is becoming more Brazen and more obvious

4923.06 --> 4928.96
too

4924.98 --> 4932.299999999999
like even the well the political actors

4928.96 --> 4934.36
they're taking on acts that are just

4932.3 --> 4938.3
starting to resemble

4934.36 --> 4939.62
villains in Nazi movies have you taken

4938.3 --> 4941.96
notice of that

4939.62 --> 4943.94
like they're actually like taking on

4941.96 --> 4945.7390000000005
those types of characters

4943.94 --> 4950.12
now

4945.739 --> 4953.839999999999
like with the the craziness everything

4950.12 --> 4957.04
they're acting like movie villains from

4953.84 --> 4957.04
Nazi movies now

4958.46 --> 4963.76
and it's

4960.86 --> 4963.759999999999
right there

4987.5 --> 4992.56
the one world religion is here they said

4990.02 --> 4992.56
ah

4993.5 --> 4996.219
that's

4996.62 --> 5000.34
um

4997.52 --> 5002.1990000000005
no no it's not

5000.34 --> 5004.78
not like that it's more like the

5002.199 --> 5007.799999999999
backdrop

5004.78 --> 5007.8
it is the

5008.679 --> 5014.7390000000005
it's part of it I mean all those things

5012.28 --> 5017.5599999999995
typically do rest on the globe Earth and

5014.739 --> 5021.04
everything that comes with that

5017.56 --> 5023.38
but it is not like the real the religion

5021.04 --> 5026.739
is more like the world religion is

5023.38 --> 5029.8
different it doesn't focus on that part

5026.739 --> 5033.459999999999
it might lend excuses for actions from

5029.8 --> 5037.38
it like oh because of evolution or no

5033.46 --> 5037.38
morality no God that sort of thing

5037.96 --> 5041.88
but it's not like going to be like an

5039.639 --> 5044.7390000000005
active like they're not worshiping

5041.88 --> 5048.659000000001
literally the globe

5044.739 --> 5048.659
it's just the backdrop

5049.26 --> 5054.46
mystery religion

5052.6 --> 5058.38
because

5054.46 --> 5058.38
it nobody knows it's a religion

5060.94 --> 5067.44
so I don't see heliocentrism as the

5063.82 --> 5067.44
religion but it's part

5067.48 --> 5070.44
they use it

5089.679 --> 5096.36
hello Wallace Bobby steals who's not

5093.4 --> 5096.36
actually welcome here

5110.14 --> 5113.209000000001
[Music]

5122.38 --> 5125.159000000001
hmm

5126.4 --> 5129.48
all right

5130.139 --> 5136.36
most people believe

5133.3 --> 5140.04
government BS and I think it'll go away

5136.36 --> 5140.04
right like they thought that

5140.08 --> 5146.62
that terrorism would go away if they

5142.78 --> 5149.94
just invaded Iraq right

5146.62 --> 5149.94
how did that work out

5170.5 --> 5176.44
I mean historically for example

5173.739 --> 5179.199
were there ever any kind of like for

5176.44 --> 5182.0199999999995
example suicide bombers over in Iraq

5179.199 --> 5185.199
when Saddam Hussein was reigning there

5182.02 --> 5189.84
when he was in power

5185.199 --> 5189.839999999999
I think that after he got toppled like

5190.719 --> 5196.06
that seriously degraded the entire

5193.3 --> 5198.88
country totally destabilized it and now

5196.06 --> 5201.1
they have like suicide bomber [ __ ] all

5198.88 --> 5203.62
the time

5201.1 --> 5205.42
that didn't happen before that that

5203.62 --> 5209.219
didn't happen when Saddam Hussein was in

5205.42 --> 5209.219
there so how did that work out

5222.1 --> 5224.76
foreign

5249.52 --> 5255.06
terrorism will go away when we stop

5251.739 --> 5255.0599999999995
paying taxes I doubt it

5257.739 --> 5263.339999999999
it's just gonna turn on the people not

5260.199 --> 5263.339999999999
paying the taxes then

5277.659 --> 5280.32
what

5282.1 --> 5284.6990000000005
okay

5293.98 --> 5299.5599999999995
you agree with America

5296.26 --> 5302.9400000000005
okay that's your prerogative geoshifter

5299.56 --> 5302.9400000000005
it doesn't really though

5307.12 --> 5311.8
but it all depends on like how the tax

5309.94 --> 5314.099999999999
system is even structured like where is

5311.8 --> 5314.1
it going

5314.639 --> 5320.56
if you got it all rigged up that your

5317.92 --> 5322.84
taxes don't actually even pay for

5320.56 --> 5324.1
anything it's like only there to pay off

5322.84 --> 5326.5
debt

5324.1 --> 5329.679
and then other groups

5326.5 --> 5332.199
that own that debt

5329.679 --> 5336.6990000000005
of the people they are actually the ones

5332.199 --> 5338.5
to do things right that's a bad setup

5336.699 --> 5341.678999999999
there used to be this thing about Texas

5338.5 --> 5343.48
called accountability and like knowing

5341.679 --> 5346.42
where your money is going

5343.48 --> 5349.739
remember that it's a long time ago now

5346.42 --> 5349.7390000000005
doesn't it seem like it

5351.76 --> 5358.6
right because if you just like

5355.12 --> 5360.28
it could be considered a tax right if

5358.6 --> 5362.620000000001
you're in a village

5360.28 --> 5365.739
is really remote

5362.62 --> 5367.96
and everybody's like dudes we we really

5365.739 --> 5370.659
need to get like a good road here

5367.96 --> 5372.699
because like it's getting bumpy and [ __ ]

5370.659 --> 5375.219
it's annoying or cars are breaking down

5372.699 --> 5377.32
we need a road

5375.219 --> 5378.639
but yeah the state or whatever they're

5377.32 --> 5380.92
not going to pay for it they don't give

5378.639 --> 5382.78
a [ __ ] it's way too remote so then they

5380.92 --> 5384.9400000000005
all decide okay we're gonna build that

5382.78 --> 5386.86
road

5384.94 --> 5388.299999999999
and everybody's gonna pay a little for

5386.86 --> 5391.659
that

5388.3 --> 5394.719
that's also taxes

5391.659 --> 5398.0199999999995
it's taxes among one another

5394.719 --> 5402.04
right but you know what it's gonna do

5398.02 --> 5404.9800000000005
it's not gonna like disappear in some

5402.04 --> 5406.96
creepy Bankers pocket

5404.98 --> 5411.58
you know exactly what it's going to be

5406.96 --> 5413.679
used for that's also taxes sort of

5411.58 --> 5415.12
and that's a good thing

5413.679 --> 5416.5
if you don't pay for that there's not

5415.12 --> 5419.8
going to be a road there's going to be a

5416.5 --> 5421.12
lot of breaking down trucks you see

5419.8 --> 5423.6990000000005
so

5421.12 --> 5425.08
it all depends on how the tax system is

5423.699 --> 5428.379999999999
set up

5425.08 --> 5430.36
it should be oversimplified

5428.38 --> 5432.88
and yeah well in an age where

5430.36 --> 5434.5
bureaucracy is just rampant

5432.88 --> 5436.3
it's always going to be the opposite

5434.5 --> 5438.58
like it's only going to get worse so

5436.3 --> 5441.1
only less representation for the

5438.58 --> 5442.96
taxation worse and worse until you

5441.1 --> 5446.1990000000005
literally just don't even know where

5442.96 --> 5448.3
it's going anymore at all

5446.199 --> 5451.299999999999
I'm like oh there's a record

5448.3 --> 5454.84
amount of like oh this country is doing

5451.3 --> 5457.42
really well and for some reason

5454.84 --> 5460.179
and like record income and yeah

5457.42 --> 5463.3
everybody's paying taxes and then

5460.179 --> 5465.6990000000005
like yeah it's just gone nobody even

5463.3 --> 5467.92
knows where that went so you're not like

5465.699 --> 5471.339999999999
seeing oh wow because of this amount of

5467.92 --> 5473.9800000000005
taxes paid now we can finally like build

5471.34 --> 5475.4800000000005
fix this bridge and build these roads

5473.98 --> 5477.759999999999
and

5475.48 --> 5481.178999999999
no

5477.76 --> 5484.719
it's just like it's disappearing because

5481.179 --> 5487.36
it's no longer taxation

5484.719 --> 5489.699
with representation it's just appear

5487.36 --> 5492.159
disappearing in some Banker's pocket

5489.699 --> 5493.419999999999
who's got everything set up in their

5492.159 --> 5495.339999999999
favor

5493.42 --> 5499.86
in their control

5495.34 --> 5499.860000000001
and that's bad that's a bad tax system

5503.62 --> 5509.44
right it isn't that ironic yeah GEOS you

5506.8 --> 5511.42
have to yeah that's exactly Belgium dude

5509.44 --> 5513.04
they got the worst roads ever but the

5511.42 --> 5514.6
highest taxes

5513.04 --> 5516.94
that they're not doing anything about

5514.6 --> 5519.400000000001
the roads because

5516.94 --> 5521.259999999999
it's not a taxation with a

5519.4 --> 5525.219
representation you don't even know where

5521.26 --> 5527.1990000000005
it's going they're not fixing like

5525.219 --> 5529.179
I think that the only way the belgiums

5527.199 --> 5532.199
are going to even be able to fix it all

5529.179 --> 5534.9400000000005
is by literally

5532.199 --> 5537.46
bypassing government and creating their

5534.94 --> 5540.04
own Road fund

5537.46 --> 5541.0
like okay we're

5540.04 --> 5544.179
just

5541.0 --> 5545.739
a foundation fixed the road foundation

5544.179 --> 5547.719
in Belgium

5545.739 --> 5549.839999999999
because the government's not going to do

5547.719 --> 5549.84
it

5555.34 --> 5559.84
but you could get crazy it might even be

5557.62 --> 5561.58
that they're just they're so arrogant

5559.84 --> 5564.159000000001
that even if you got the money together

5561.58 --> 5566.139
they're still not gonna allow you to

5564.159 --> 5568.599999999999
have the roads fixed because they don't

5566.139 --> 5571.54
want it to be fixed they want everything

5568.6 --> 5573.52
to be broken down

5571.54 --> 5575.86
because they're afraid that if

5573.52 --> 5578.26
everything gets fixed that they will be

5575.86 --> 5580.54
people will outgrow them and they'll

5578.26 --> 5582.820000000001
lose control because they've all turned

5580.54 --> 5586.239
to complete Grapplers

5582.82 --> 5590.199
and Communists and Communists and

5586.239 --> 5591.82
Grapplers suppress they suppress the

5590.199 --> 5594.219
people they don't make them flourish

5591.82 --> 5595.96
they suppress out of fear of losing

5594.219 --> 5599.52
control

5595.96 --> 5599.52
so they don't fix things

5608.32 --> 5610.799999999999
right

5623.139 --> 5625.679
all right

5626.8 --> 5632.1990000000005
and yeah once you got them in place it's

5630.1 --> 5635.02
very tough to get rid of them

5632.199 --> 5637.719
because they're gonna make it impossible

5635.02 --> 5639.280000000001
for you to get rid of them by literally

5637.719 --> 5642.58
depriving you

5639.28 --> 5644.8
just like in feudal times you don't feed

5642.58 --> 5647.139
the peasants enough food

5644.8 --> 5649.719
to grow strong and do better because

5647.139 --> 5650.7390000000005
then they could Revolt no they gotta be

5649.719 --> 5652.96
weak

5650.739 --> 5654.638999999999
weaker than the soldiers that are all

5652.96 --> 5656.02
well fed

5654.639 --> 5659.38
because then

5656.02 --> 5661.360000000001
just a group of soldiers can like take

5659.38 --> 5663.400000000001
down all the peasants

5661.36 --> 5665.5599999999995
but if they're all well fed then the

5663.4 --> 5667.179
peasants actually grow more muscle and

5665.56 --> 5668.860000000001
they will be able to

5667.179 --> 5671.5
fight back

5668.86 --> 5674.32
so you don't let that happen in a feudal

5671.5 --> 5676.96
or communist system you deprive the

5674.32 --> 5679.42
farmers the peasants

5676.96 --> 5684.119
from what they really need

5679.42 --> 5684.119
proper living conditions proper food

5684.58 --> 5690.58
maybe some sort of Education other than

5687.88 --> 5692.7390000000005
just mind control on how to be a

5690.58 --> 5694.84
obedient peasant

5692.739 --> 5697.718999999999
they don't give that to the people

5694.84 --> 5702.179
because then they get into trouble

5697.719 --> 5702.179
because they've become grabblers

5703.719 --> 5709.0
they've already went too far

5706.659 --> 5711.159
when you go too far

5709.0 --> 5712.8
everybody knows it then you have to

5711.159 --> 5716.08
deprive everybody

5712.8 --> 5718.0
constantly or they'll get you for what

5716.08 --> 5720.04
you've done

5718.0 --> 5721.42
because they hate you they just can't do

5720.04 --> 5723.5199999999995
anything about it because you keep

5721.42 --> 5727.26
depriving them

5723.52 --> 5727.26
turn them Gail yes

5727.9 --> 5734.46
oh that's part of the modern strategy

5730.179 --> 5734.46
for mind controls make everybody gay

5735.699 --> 5740.799999999999
become more susceptible to peer pressure

5737.86 --> 5742.48
political power to hide under political

5740.8 --> 5744.400000000001
power

5742.48 --> 5746.86
you lose connection with God you lose

5744.4 --> 5749.98
your sensibilities your

5746.86 --> 5751.599999999999
very like more likely to become sick

5749.98 --> 5754.119
because of

5751.6 --> 5757.900000000001
pumping and all that

5754.119 --> 5760.239
and yeah that'll just feed the medical

5757.9 --> 5762.759999999999
system

5760.239 --> 5764.86
so they have no issues with that they

5762.76 --> 5768.280000000001
have no issues with people

5764.86 --> 5770.199
behaving terribly making themselves sick

5768.28 --> 5773.32
and chronically ill

5770.199 --> 5775.239
because they will still profit from that

5773.32 --> 5777.219
and hey if you're sick and Ill you're

5775.239 --> 5779.44
not gonna resist you're going to be

5777.219 --> 5781.719
dependent on the system so you might

5779.44 --> 5785.5599999999995
actually then be manipulated to help

5781.719 --> 5789.6
defend that system yeah they all got it

5785.56 --> 5789.6
worked out it's all systematic

5802.54 --> 5804.719
foreign

5857.139 --> 5861.28
anyway

5859.48 --> 5862.718999999999
I think I might be rounding out the show

5861.28 --> 5865.48
a little early

5862.719 --> 5868.06
that way I can go out for groceries and

5865.48 --> 5870.58
not miss half the FED show

5868.06 --> 5873.280000000001
I did start early today

5870.58 --> 5876.219
unless you guys uh

5873.28 --> 5878.739
want me to address another thing I think

5876.219 --> 5881.28
I rolled on about this specific subject

5878.739 --> 5881.28
long enough

5884.56 --> 5888.88
but yeah it is kind of I'm taking a

5887.199 --> 5891.759999999999
counter position in a way it's it's

5888.88 --> 5893.08
confusing even to me I'm trying to do

5891.76 --> 5896.56
the right thing I'm not trying to

5893.08 --> 5899.08
confuse it's just that

5896.56 --> 5902.26
one hand there is like the

5899.08 --> 5904.119
the bear method the Owen Benjamin method

5902.26 --> 5907.4800000000005
which is like just keep building don't

5904.119 --> 5910.96
get dragged into bad things and just be

5907.48 --> 5913.54
like Peak productive and maintain that

5910.96 --> 5917.02
and follow logos and that's really good

5913.54 --> 5920.8
way to go about but I don't feel it

5917.02 --> 5923.639
it's not like the ultimate like it's it

5920.8 --> 5928.3
has to be a part of it like just to

5923.639 --> 5931.2390000000005
remit retain your cohesion versus the

5928.3 --> 5934.179
ever insane growing Beast system yes

5931.239 --> 5937.839999999999
it's like necessary but I don't think it

5934.179 --> 5939.639
like will eventually break the system

5937.84 --> 5941.08
because as they're growing more insane

5939.639 --> 5943.42
they will just

5941.08 --> 5946.96
lose

5943.42 --> 5949.06
common decency and and they will come

5946.96 --> 5952.179
after you it's like guaranteed because

5949.06 --> 5954.219
there's nothing to to cap off the level

5952.179 --> 5956.02
of insanity towards which they are

5954.219 --> 5958.54
growing there's nothing to cap it off

5956.02 --> 5960.9400000000005
there's nothing to stop it

5958.54 --> 5964.78
only like

5960.94 --> 5967.178999999999
rough physical action

5964.78 --> 5969.46
I feel can't stop them

5967.179 --> 5972.639
even though that seems

5969.46 --> 5975.28
like the opposite of like building it

5972.639 --> 5978.96
building yourself out of it

5975.28 --> 5978.96
I don't know if it is right because

5979.3 --> 5983.4400000000005
if everybody just gets riled up like we

5982.0 --> 5985.9
have to go after something we have to go

5983.44 --> 5989.08
after something

5985.9 --> 5991.659
and just constantly like fed like the

5989.08 --> 5993.28
the rage being fed rage over and over

5991.659 --> 5995.799999999999
and over again and like until you're

5993.28 --> 5997.239
like I'm ready to start just destroying

5995.8 --> 6000.78
[ __ ]

5997.239 --> 6002.699
well that's how you end up with BLM

6000.78 --> 6005.46
riots you see

6002.699 --> 6007.619
that's people being riled up constantly

6005.46 --> 6009.179
over and over again until they're just

6007.619 --> 6011.639
full of rage and they just want to

6009.179 --> 6013.139
destroy [ __ ] and attack people perceived

6011.639 --> 6015.659000000001
enemies

6013.139 --> 6016.5
that's not the solution either for our

6015.659 --> 6019.259999999999
side

6016.5 --> 6021.179
but there has to be like Resolute there

6019.26 --> 6022.219
has to be taken a

6021.179 --> 6024.84
almost

6022.219 --> 6028.26
militant stand

6024.84 --> 6030.96
like knowing like yeah it's going to

6028.26 --> 6032.280000000001
probably end up in violence one way or

6030.96 --> 6035.1
the other

6032.28 --> 6037.32
I just don't want to be the recipients

6035.1 --> 6039.42
of the violence when that comes about

6037.32 --> 6042.0
I'd rather be

6039.42 --> 6044.46
a militant opposition

6042.0 --> 6046.08
when that happens and you have to work

6044.46 --> 6049.139
towards that

6046.08 --> 6051.179
also mentally to be prepared like it is

6049.139 --> 6053.28
going to be War there's nothing that can

6051.179 --> 6056.9400000000005
prevent it nothing in the world that can

6053.28 --> 6059.759999999999
prevent us from doing that except giving

6056.94 --> 6062.699
up and then just dying

6059.76 --> 6064.9800000000005
that's the only alternative

6062.699 --> 6068.04
and you got to keep building at the same

6064.98 --> 6070.678999999999
time just to maintain personal cohesion

6068.04 --> 6072.78
and not to demoralize yourself

6070.679 --> 6074.76
that's the reason to do it but it

6072.78 --> 6077.82
doesn't make

6074.76 --> 6080.219
the darkness truly go away it just makes

6077.82 --> 6081.0
you less susceptible less vulnerable to

6080.219 --> 6085.1
it

6081.0 --> 6085.1
that shit's still gonna keep growing

6085.38 --> 6089.28
the people that are invested in that

6087.42 --> 6090.9
that can't get out that are growing

6089.28 --> 6093.42
worse they're not gonna become better

6090.9 --> 6096.54
they're only gonna grow worse because

6093.42 --> 6099.2390000000005
that's part of the tactic to maintain

6096.54 --> 6102.0
control and they can't stop letting it

6099.239 --> 6104.218999999999
grow worse they can't stop it

6102.0 --> 6106.92
so you got to draw your conclusions from

6104.219 --> 6110.219
that it's going to end up in a certain

6106.92 --> 6111.78
way and you got to be prepared for that

6110.219 --> 6116.2390000000005
and

6111.78 --> 6116.239
you got to figure out like can we

6118.86 --> 6121.699
somehow

6121.739 --> 6129.599999999999
organize in a way in a non maybe

6124.86 --> 6134.0599999999995
non-obvious way even to get people in

6129.6 --> 6134.06
the places and then make the move

6138.84 --> 6144.3
make Mass arrests

6141.239 --> 6148.759999999999
like a whole bunch of people including

6144.3 --> 6153.139
like judges also like big big time

6148.76 --> 6156.0
really big politics judges media people

6153.139 --> 6158.76
industrialists all the people that are

6156.0 --> 6161.219
key factors in maintaining all of this

6158.76 --> 6162.3
and just all taken down all at the same

6161.219 --> 6164.94
time

6162.3 --> 6166.860000000001
somehow but yeah we can't really count

6164.94 --> 6171.719
on the police now

6166.86 --> 6173.82
it has to be civilian based I think

6171.719 --> 6176.639
because as soon as you entangle you

6173.82 --> 6179.759999999999
become a functionary in the system

6176.639 --> 6182.28
you become entangled with that system

6179.76 --> 6185.639
and its corruption and they will just

6182.28 --> 6188.46
make they will make you

6185.639 --> 6190.8
unable to do that then

6188.46 --> 6192.659
you'll just be forced in a position

6190.8 --> 6195.26
where you end up defending the system

6192.659 --> 6195.259999999999
instead

6196.92 --> 6200.96
so how do you get to that point

6201.06 --> 6206.820000000001
and is everybody ready to accept the

6204.179 --> 6208.5
backlash which will be there they it

6206.82 --> 6212.659
will be there

6208.5 --> 6212.659
if you're gonna do this in your country

6212.82 --> 6217.739
and you're like literally taking the

6214.98 --> 6220.259999999999
government down and really getting it

6217.739 --> 6222.599999999999
well then all the entanglements that

6220.26 --> 6224.52
they had with the other Grapplers and

6222.6 --> 6226.1990000000005
all the other countries they're all

6224.52 --> 6227.88
suddenly come after you there you're

6226.199 --> 6230.46
gonna be declared with your country like

6227.88 --> 6233.639
oh Hitler just took over or something

6230.46 --> 6236.639
watch the knots they'll make up anything

6233.639 --> 6236.639
anything

6237.84 --> 6244.1990000000005
to try to undo it again

6241.199 --> 6246.119
right so it's just one country does that

6244.199 --> 6250.5599999999995
that might be

6246.119 --> 6252.42
like yeah that might not last very long

6250.56 --> 6256.320000000001
it'll just be taken back

6252.42 --> 6259.5
but if it happens in a lot of places at

6256.32 --> 6261.0599999999995
the same time everywhere then they're

6259.5 --> 6262.619
all going to be preoccupied with their

6261.06 --> 6265.679
own [ __ ] it's going to seem like a World

6262.619 --> 6268.32
Revolution instead of all all the media

6265.679 --> 6270.719
piling onto one place oh Hitler just

6268.32 --> 6273.48
took over a look at that they're going

6270.719 --> 6276.659
after the judges and because they're

6273.48 --> 6279.659
whatever they're gay or they're black or

6276.659 --> 6283.099999999999
any [ __ ] any [ __ ] part of the

6279.659 --> 6286.259999999999
narrative they'll throw at you until you

6283.1 --> 6288.4800000000005
start RIP just because of the repetition

6286.26 --> 6290.1
of hearing that [ __ ] you'll just hair in

6288.48 --> 6293.58
your head they're Hitler their Hitler

6290.1 --> 6295.7390000000005
their Hitler all the time

6293.58 --> 6298.5599999999995
like if you think that like the [ __ ]

6295.739 --> 6301.259999999999
they did with Trump making him look bad

6298.56 --> 6302.76
all the time if you think that was bad

6301.26 --> 6307.76
guess what

6302.76 --> 6307.76
that can be worse and it would be

6307.92 --> 6314.159
so you're also if you actually decide to

6312.179 --> 6315.9
be part of like a revolution like that

6314.159 --> 6318.98
you gotta realize

6315.9 --> 6322.98
it will be that bad there's a likelihood

6318.98 --> 6326.099999999999
it'll fail and you'll end up like as a

6322.98 --> 6328.5599999999995
like on a terrorist list and you will

6326.1 --> 6331.1990000000005
probably be found and arrested

6328.56 --> 6333.6
and then have like smear trials all over

6331.199 --> 6335.58
the place and end up the rest the rest

6333.6 --> 6339.06
of your life in jail

6335.58 --> 6340.26
there's just I don't see

6339.06 --> 6341.580000000001
yeah

6340.26 --> 6343.860000000001
but

6341.58 --> 6346.38
does that mean that

6343.86 --> 6349.38
it's better not to do that and let

6346.38 --> 6352.02
literally everybody go into a slow

6349.38 --> 6354.3
grinding death until like everybody's

6352.02 --> 6357.06
lost their mind and loses the will live

6354.3 --> 6358.860000000001
and suicide rate goes up and up and up

6357.06 --> 6361.02
and up and then

6358.86 --> 6363.42
you literally don't even know what

6361.02 --> 6364.8
country you're living in anymore is that

6363.42 --> 6367.639
better

6364.8 --> 6367.639
it's tough

6370.56 --> 6374.6990000000005
they give it in truths with Justice yeah

6372.719 --> 6377.0
but what about the back the backlash

6374.699 --> 6377.0
though

6379.08 --> 6381.5599999999995
right

6382.02 --> 6387.2390000000005
I mean the Grapplers in a country have

6384.9 --> 6389.219
deals with other Grabbers in other

6387.239 --> 6391.379999999999
countries if suddenly that government

6389.219 --> 6392.94
just becomes completely taken down

6391.38 --> 6397.02
they're going to be a whole bunch of

6392.94 --> 6399.839999999999
people mad that their deal just broke

6397.02 --> 6402.84
and they're gonna push their governments

6399.84 --> 6405.42
and their media to come after you

6402.84 --> 6408.6
to basically

6405.42 --> 6411.659
get their their their gravel back they

6408.6 --> 6412.9800000000005
want it back because they that's what

6411.659 --> 6414.719
Grabbers do

6412.98 --> 6417.48
they're always networking with other

6414.719 --> 6419.159
gravelas they got deals set up and if

6417.48 --> 6420.659
you then take them down then suddenly

6419.159 --> 6423.0
there's going to be people basically

6420.659 --> 6427.08
with financial losses

6423.0 --> 6427.08
and they want retribution

6436.139 --> 6441.2390000000005
you into crypto at all not really

6438.78 --> 6442.08
I mean I accept crypto but I'm not

6441.239 --> 6445.08
really

6442.08 --> 6449.0599999999995
active with it

6445.08 --> 6449.0599999999995
yeah get their gravel back that's right

6449.52 --> 6456.659000000001
it's it's kind of like smog right

6453.36 --> 6460.0199999999995
smoke add so much gold

6456.659 --> 6462.5599999999995
he could literally die under its weight

6460.02 --> 6462.56
but

6462.96 --> 6469.08
if you take from he's gonna he would get

6465.42 --> 6471.4800000000005
his gravel back it's like dragons don't

6469.08 --> 6473.58
they steal everything and then they

6471.48 --> 6475.5599999999995
think they own it and if you then take

6473.58 --> 6478.44
it away from them

6475.56 --> 6481.639
they're gonna take it back

6478.44 --> 6481.638999999999
because that's what they do

6482.52 --> 6486.119000000001
they claimed it it's theirs now even

6484.56 --> 6489.080000000001
though they stole it it's theirs now

6486.119 --> 6489.08
that's how they see it

6499.92 --> 6504.619
where do you learn about this stuff

6505.679 --> 6512.76
who are you talking about Robert digital

6508.92 --> 6514.1990000000005
I don't I learn about that stuff

6512.76 --> 6516.54
from

6514.199 --> 6519.599999999999
purely my own

6516.54 --> 6523.58
staring at the distance experience over

6519.6 --> 6523.58
a lifetime of studying Humanity

6523.679 --> 6529.02
don't get it from books

6526.8 --> 6531.659000000001
I get it from learning

6529.02 --> 6534.119000000001
from other people and their temporary

6531.659 --> 6535.86
opinions or their long-term opinions and

6534.119 --> 6537.299999999999
then weighing it off with everything

6535.86 --> 6541.92
else

6537.3 --> 6541.92
I just try to be realistic

6543.42 --> 6548.58
and not fall into some kind of political

6545.82 --> 6552.179
railroad opinion

6548.58 --> 6554.78
to have some kind of a crowd Advantage I

6552.179 --> 6554.78
don't do that

6560.58 --> 6564.679
my source of knowledge is God

6570.0 --> 6573.36
I mean

6571.32 --> 6575.94
hey if you

6573.36 --> 6578.82
think it's like wrong

6575.94 --> 6582.138999999999
God talks to me no the god talks to

6578.82 --> 6582.139
everybody I'm just listening

6584.34 --> 6587.4800000000005
right it's the information

6588.739 --> 6594.78
comes out of us right we come up with

6592.02 --> 6596.88
ideas where does that come from it comes

6594.78 --> 6600.86
from God

6596.88 --> 6600.86
the nowhere the first

6603.78 --> 6609.54
I don't judge not my place

6606.3 --> 6611.9400000000005
fine I'm just saying that if you have

6609.54 --> 6614.28
like a

6611.94 --> 6616.739
technical disagreement about things that

6614.28 --> 6618.599
I've said I'd literally like to hear

6616.739 --> 6621.0
about it if you have like yeah but what

6618.599 --> 6623.76
about this historical reference and that

6621.0 --> 6625.56
and then paint a different picture that

6623.76 --> 6627.360000000001
would make

6625.56 --> 6629.639
what I've everything I've been saying

6627.36 --> 6632.58
like the last 20 minutes

6629.639 --> 6638.04
like obviously incorrect

6632.58 --> 6642.599
right I'm okay with that if you could

6638.04 --> 6645.86
figure it out this is my wide conclusion

6642.599 --> 6645.860000000001
about it all

6646.44 --> 6652.4
it's why I basically walk back and forth

6649.619 --> 6656.5199999999995
thinking thinking thinking on my balcony

6652.4 --> 6660.598999999999
dream walking as I kind of called it

6656.52 --> 6663.119000000001
for years years every day

6660.599 --> 6666.96
I end up doing that

6663.119 --> 6669.598999999999
I worry and in the worry I tried to

6666.96 --> 6670.619
figure everything out like the bigger

6669.599 --> 6674.219
things

6670.619 --> 6678.0599999999995
and just to try to fine-tune the

6674.219 --> 6679.619
understanding of the fractal dynamics of

6678.06 --> 6682.139
things and their developments

6679.619 --> 6685.44
universally

6682.139 --> 6688.4400000000005
just to fine-tune my insight on

6685.44 --> 6691.339999999999
understanding how these things develop

6688.44 --> 6691.339999999999
it's what I do

6697.739 --> 6702.659
I don't agree it's clear that's not

6700.32 --> 6706.44
criticism saying you don't agree is not

6702.659 --> 6710.58
criticism I mean if you have a

6706.44 --> 6712.5599999999995
technical in content disagreement

6710.58 --> 6715.08
that you have referenced to that you

6712.56 --> 6717.719
could lay out I'd be listening

6715.08 --> 6720.48
right I I do like criticism because

6717.719 --> 6722.88
criticism keeps me sharp

6720.48 --> 6724.799999999999
you see I like credits I even like

6722.88 --> 6726.84
trolls sometimes

6724.8 --> 6727.679
everybody here knows that there's a

6726.84 --> 6729.54
troll

6727.679 --> 6730.38
you're not allowed to ban them straight

6729.54 --> 6731.94
away

6730.38 --> 6735.26
because

6731.94 --> 6735.259999999999
I take that challenge

6736.619 --> 6741.179
and the same goes for criticism if you

6738.78 --> 6742.98
actually have Smart criticism I will

6741.179 --> 6744.179
listen are you sure you aren't a

6742.98 --> 6746.28
novelist

6744.179 --> 6749.9400000000005
what

6746.28 --> 6752.28
well old horse Rod born

6749.94 --> 6755.5199999999995
Maybe

6752.28 --> 6757.08
but I am the novel in that case

6755.52 --> 6760.040000000001
I am the book

6757.08 --> 6760.04
I write it

6763.08 --> 6767.5199999999995
and my shows and the things I say on my

6765.78 --> 6771.259999999999
show are

6767.52 --> 6771.26
the paper that I write on

6775.02 --> 6783.9800000000005
but yeah I have

6777.9 --> 6783.98
interest in storytelling Arts absolutely

6785.04 --> 6789.119
it's all about presentation

6787.26 --> 6793.26
and about

6789.119 --> 6797.179
people their ability to assimilate if

6793.26 --> 6797.179
it's presented in a certain setup

6797.82 --> 6804.0
so yeah maybe that's what you're feeling

6800.34 --> 6807.54
about it like I am almost presenting it

6804.0 --> 6808.5
like a story sometimes because if I just

6807.54 --> 6810.54
like

6808.5 --> 6814.159
like a weird

6810.54 --> 6814.159
more overtly

6814.5 --> 6817.04
good

6819.06 --> 6823.7390000000005
like a more overtly artist just give you

6821.699 --> 6825.839999999999
the raw [ __ ] you're gonna be like what

6823.739 --> 6828.419999999999
the hell is he talking about no I

6825.84 --> 6831.06
I have that but I'm at the same time

6828.42 --> 6833.9400000000005
trying

6831.06 --> 6836.659000000001
to present it in a way that people can

6833.94 --> 6836.659
get it better

6837.599 --> 6843.1990000000005
and auto

6839.42 --> 6843.1990000000005
didacty what

6844.32 --> 6849.0599999999995
ever I heard that word but I don't

6847.199 --> 6851.419999999999
exactly know what that means let me look

6849.06 --> 6851.42
it up

6855.08 --> 6858.9
self-educated

6856.679 --> 6862.139
okay without guidance of Master

6858.9 --> 6864.179
institutions is that an autodidactic I

6862.139 --> 6867.42
always thought it was just eclectic okay

6864.179 --> 6871.1990000000005
well yeah I guess I am that exactly that

6867.42 --> 6872.639
I always thought it's just eclectic

6871.199 --> 6874.619
self-taught

6872.639 --> 6877.46
following your own route maybe it's just

6874.619 --> 6877.46
enough a synonym

6877.679 --> 6881.719
maybe it's Anonymous I don't know

6887.76 --> 6892.5
oh damn the time has flown

6890.4 --> 6894.299999999999
hundreds of Menses of Grapplers in print

6892.5 --> 6896.159
would be entertaining literature yeah

6894.3 --> 6900.2390000000005
but I'm using that

6896.159 --> 6902.46
because I also apply Owen Benjamin lore

6900.239 --> 6903.659
he's very very good

6902.46 --> 6906.42
with that

6903.659 --> 6910.08
and

6906.42 --> 6912.54
well I'd like to say that I lend it his

6910.08 --> 6914.639
Concepts I think he's okay with that so

6912.54 --> 6916.619
long as you fairly represent you don't

6914.639 --> 6918.42
try to twist it out of context and all

6916.619 --> 6920.28
that I don't do that

6918.42 --> 6922.7390000000005
but I definitely have my own opinions

6920.28 --> 6927.84
and sometimes they

6922.739 --> 6930.9
seem to like be very different from owns

6927.84 --> 6933.0
but I agree with a lot of what he says

6930.9 --> 6934.339999999999
and I really appreciate his

6933.0 --> 6936.54
contributions

6934.34 --> 6940.1990000000005
lingual wise

6936.54 --> 6941.58
and grabbler well he popularized that he

6940.199 --> 6944.879999999999
didn't invent it because it was

6941.58 --> 6947.94
originally from The Onion

6944.88 --> 6949.02
I'll never forget that it was like so

6947.94 --> 6952.0199999999995
hilarious

6949.02 --> 6955.92
but I've like took the concept very

6952.02 --> 6958.4400000000005
serious basically to

6955.92 --> 6961.08
to find a designation

6958.44 --> 6963.839999999999
for the people that do it without just

6961.08 --> 6966.0599999999995
calling them Jews and a lot of the times

6963.84 --> 6967.38
there aren't or they're like fake Jews

6966.06 --> 6970.1990000000005
they're like

6967.38 --> 6972.619
they say they are but they don't act

6970.199 --> 6972.619
like it

6975.0 --> 6982.08
so I just call it Grabbers

6978.96 --> 6984.179
because it emphasized like I gotta grab

6982.08 --> 6985.44
it in you and you did it and all that

6984.179 --> 6987.119
right

6985.44 --> 6990.0
that's what I do

6987.119 --> 6992.219
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

6990.0 --> 6993.599
turned out a pretty good show

6992.219 --> 6995.58
I think

6993.599 --> 6999.179
second half at least

6995.58 --> 7001.159
anyway if you like this show well first

6999.179 --> 7003.679
off thanks everyone for coming I hope

7001.159 --> 7005.96
you liked this show if you did then

7036.98 --> 7043.098999999999
like that gives me the it's like an

7040.34 --> 7046.04
encouragement that my concept for a dual

7043.099 --> 7047.900000000001
cosmogonical Society might actually be

7046.04 --> 7050.239
halfway viable

7047.9 --> 7053.299999999999
right in the world like this

7050.239 --> 7055.04
