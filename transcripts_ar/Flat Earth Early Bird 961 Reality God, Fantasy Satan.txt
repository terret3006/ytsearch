from nice and sunny and warm to suddenly

102.799 --> 105.759
fully clouded

107.6 --> 112.83999999999999
and not super warm anymore although it's

109.84 --> 115.84
it's really not

112.84 --> 115.84
cold

123.6 --> 129.84
it feels like it's a really active day

126.56 --> 129.84
really a day to do stuff

130.72 --> 135.52
build garden

138.72 --> 143.84
all right

145.04 --> 147.35999999999999
so

149.92 --> 156.879
hello again first in chat

153.12 --> 160.08
still hot over there in the uk okay

156.879 --> 162.959
30 degrees now well let me check the

160.08 --> 162.959
temperature over here

163.68 --> 167.20000000000002
yeah it's 20 degrees here

169.04 --> 172.48
so it certainly went down a bit

182.84 --> 188.879
right

185.44 --> 192.48
so it is friday the 23rd

188.879 --> 192.48
of july 2021

196.8 --> 199.92000000000002
hello rocket blimps

201.2 --> 205.44
two it's two here what

209.92 --> 218.07999999999998
right anyway yeah hope to have a

213.44 --> 220.48
show a little short of two hours today

218.08 --> 222.239
talk about pretty much anything i kind

220.48 --> 226.56
of

222.239 --> 231.519
plucked together something from my

226.56 --> 231.519
picture database for title card

234.239 --> 241.12
it's getting kind of like tough now to

237.92 --> 242.319
keep on thinking of new things so yeah

241.12 --> 245.12
it might be that

242.319 --> 246.72
like after this weekend or something uh

245.12 --> 250.31900000000002
it's just gonna stop

246.72 --> 253.439
and then maybe as soon as i get

250.319 --> 256.64
a new idea i'll get back to a title card

253.439 --> 256.64
or i'll try to just

258.959 --> 263.519
fix something every time we'll see

264.639 --> 269.84000000000003
right but the novelty is kind of off it

266.96 --> 269.84
i think

269.919 --> 277.52
it's two degrees australia

274.16 --> 280.88000000000005
okay right so

277.52 --> 283.19899999999996
it's pretty cold over there well it is

280.88 --> 285.759
winter

283.199 --> 288.24
the olympics start today okay i didn't

285.759 --> 288.24
know that

294.84 --> 297.84
hmm

307.52 --> 312.32
right so how are you guys doing

310.16 --> 313.199
yesterday's flat earth debate was pretty

312.32 --> 315.52
epic

313.199 --> 317.759
lasted incredibly long with the after

315.52 --> 317.75899999999996
show

318.96 --> 326.0
it's like two hour after show

322.56 --> 331.12
at least two hours but there was

326.0 --> 331.12
again a baller that was just

331.919 --> 338.639
well it was an anti-flat earther really

335.039 --> 343.28
and nathan actually went over to ask

338.639 --> 346.56
a question was it 55 times

343.28 --> 350.4
so it was one of those shows we'll see

346.56 --> 350.4
it tomorrow on the saturday premiere

351.28 --> 357.039
it was like super frustrating and

353.6 --> 357.03900000000004
hilarious at the same time

359.44 --> 364.8
right but yeah classic flatter today

364.84 --> 367.84
show

368.08 --> 381.84
hey mitchell from australia good to see

370.08 --> 381.84
you how are you doing

418.96 --> 424.0
i feel just really nice and calm it's

420.88 --> 427.039
kind of a weird moment for it

424.0 --> 427.599
it's so typical it happens every single

427.039 --> 430.24
time

427.599 --> 433.84
with the shows these days i don't even

430.24 --> 436.0
know if you're like coming to expect it

433.84 --> 438.88
usually up until right before the show

436.0 --> 441.759
my job my head just jumbles around and

438.88 --> 443.12
last night as well lots of data from all

441.759 --> 447.12
sides

443.12 --> 449.12
synchronicity is just going ballistic

447.12 --> 450.72
but then when my show starts it's like

449.12 --> 453.28000000000003
oh it's like

450.72 --> 455.12
oh finally i can let that go even though

453.28 --> 456.4
i'm actually supposed to be talking

455.12 --> 459.12
about it

456.4 --> 459.12
it's weird

459.84 --> 464.0
it's like i get the opposite of what i

462.319 --> 467.599
was hoping for but

464.0 --> 470.479
eventually it always finds its way back

467.599 --> 473.28
usually halfway the show hopefully a

470.479 --> 473.28
little earlier

473.52 --> 476.87899999999996
everything falls into place everything

476.24 --> 479.84000000000003
that i did

476.879 --> 479.84000000000003
experience

480.0 --> 483.12
in the previous day

486.479 --> 493.84
all right okay so

489.52 --> 493.84
you're managing to avoid the lockdown

495.84 --> 504.15999999999997
so is it still like big cities

500.4 --> 506.31899999999996
like victoria i think

504.16 --> 508.16
and what is it melbourne or something

506.319 --> 510.08000000000004
that are like under the log that that

508.16 --> 512.399
specifically get locked down get the

510.08 --> 515.519
covet treatment nonsense

512.399 --> 518.0
and the rest of the country not so much

515.519 --> 519.039
i mean i hear a lot of like dire news

518.0 --> 523.76
stories and

519.039 --> 523.76
like insane police actions

525.839 --> 530.24
from australia in in the recent few

528.399 --> 534.48
months so

530.24 --> 538.0
victoria's estate what oh

534.48 --> 538.0
okay sorry

541.04 --> 549.8389999999999
i said nemo warm adelaide right

551.68 --> 556.0
right so it's only big cities it's very

554.72 --> 559.6
typical

556.0 --> 559.6
very typical how this is working

561.68 --> 565.519
like the whole covet lockdown mind

564.24 --> 568.9590000000001
control

565.519 --> 570.48
attempt attempts seem to really be

568.959 --> 573.92
directed

570.48 --> 574.839
wherever it's rooted itself in in the

573.92 --> 577.68
biggest

574.839 --> 579.6
cities

577.68 --> 581.8389999999999
in all the countries this is really

579.6 --> 584.8000000000001
standing out to me

581.839 --> 586.1600000000001
it's all directed at really metropolitan

584.8 --> 588.56
areas

586.16 --> 590.64
that's where they crack down that's

588.56 --> 593.8389999999999
where they lock down that's why they

590.64 --> 593.8389999999999
indoctrinate the most

594.959 --> 599.4399999999999
hey getting wisdom good to see you tony

602.839 --> 605.839
whitcomb

606.079 --> 609.76
i've been locked down all lies yeah me

609.44 --> 613.0400000000001
too

609.76 --> 616.0
tony whitcomb no i'm not dude

613.04 --> 617.36
i don't even inform myself it's like oh

616.0 --> 621.04
really it's supposed to be locked

617.36 --> 623.6
whatever i'm just going to do what i

621.04 --> 623.5999999999999
want to do

626.24 --> 634.399
like i'm not that demanding

630.6 --> 634.399
maneuverability wise anyway

639.279 --> 643.2
so even when there was like the curfew

641.68 --> 645.519
over here

643.2 --> 646.399
like i'm not a person that constantly

645.519 --> 647.92
wanting to go

646.399 --> 651.2
outside and walk in the middle of the

647.92 --> 651.1999999999999
night or something outside

654.88 --> 659.68
although yeah if i'd still had a car

657.12 --> 659.68
then maybe

659.76 --> 663.8389999999999
because when i still had my car back in

661.6 --> 665.6
the day i did have like moments where i

663.839 --> 666.8000000000001
feel like okay i want to get in my car

665.6 --> 668.32
in the middle of the night and just

666.8 --> 675.8389999999999
drive

668.32 --> 679.279
right but yeah

675.839 --> 679.2790000000001
ew dean white

679.44 --> 685.6800000000001
slow vaccine uptake yeah there shouldn't

682.16 --> 685.68
be any vaccine uptake

685.92 --> 693.36
nobody should be doing that

689.36 --> 695.6800000000001
and every corporation

693.36 --> 698.32
that demands vaccines for their

695.68 --> 701.3599999999999
employees should be considered as fallen

698.32 --> 703.44
and like

701.36 --> 704.399
they should be considered as okay

703.44 --> 707.6
apparently this

704.399 --> 707.6
is not really

707.839 --> 714.72
worth it find another

712.079 --> 715.76
yeah find another profession or find

714.72 --> 719.519
that profession

715.76 --> 722.639
in a new form that doesn't need

719.519 --> 725.12
that corporation that is obviously

722.639 --> 725.12
corrupting

728.839 --> 731.839
uh

733.279 --> 745.8389999999999
i think you're wasting my time mr s

737.279 --> 745.8389999999999
that's what i think

754.8 --> 760.8
right but yeah there is this thing you

758.079 --> 763.279
know there is of course

760.8 --> 765.12
in the face of everything that's

763.279 --> 766.48
happening is rolling out all the news

765.12 --> 769.279
all the

766.48 --> 770.839
government announcements and all the

769.279 --> 774.56
warnings from

770.839 --> 776.9590000000001
doctors and then the mind control

774.56 --> 778.959
programming and how insanely far they

776.959 --> 780.4799999999999
some of these people take it sometimes

778.959 --> 782.959
it's really dark

780.48 --> 782.9590000000001
creepy

783.839 --> 792.24
but in reality i don't think that

788.399 --> 794.8
things can actually be mandated

792.24 --> 796.16
like they it's just they can't really do

794.8 --> 799.92
it they can only just

796.16 --> 803.279
make it really really seductive in many

799.92 --> 803.279
ways for you to take it

805.12 --> 809.76
bring out every lollipop promise every

807.519 --> 814.0
fancy pants

809.76 --> 816.079
they can to make you take it that's it

814.0 --> 818.48
i don't think they can actually make it

816.079 --> 818.4799999999999
take it

822.8 --> 829.279
right like the worst that could

826.0 --> 831.72
technically happen i think is that

829.279 --> 835.8389999999999
people could be

831.72 --> 839.279
indoctrinated to by their own volition

835.839 --> 842.32
violate the durnburg code and

839.279 --> 843.199
or yeah basically assault people to take

842.32 --> 847.12
it

843.199 --> 850.0
from based on obsession

847.12 --> 851.199
from themselves not having official

850.0 --> 854.88
orders

851.199 --> 856.88
right so maybe that's the strategy maybe

854.88 --> 859.8389999999999
they just try to indoctrinate

856.88 --> 862.079
people so much so that fanatics will

859.839 --> 866.48
step up and kind of do the damage

862.079 --> 869.519
for them while they retain legal cover

866.48 --> 870.16
right this might be part of the

869.519 --> 872.24
mechanism

870.16 --> 874.3199999999999
that is the long-term mechanism that

872.24 --> 877.839
they're trying to utilize to get as much

874.32 --> 877.839
people vaccinated as possible

880.72 --> 899.839
yeah dude get the hell out of here i'm

884.88 --> 899.8389999999999
not wasting my time on that [ __ ]

900.56 --> 908.7199999999999
yeah cut social payments right so yeah

905.12 --> 913.839
what is that anyway so they cut

908.72 --> 913.839
the handouts that you rely on

918.399 --> 923.04
so you've yeah that means that people

921.04 --> 926.399
have basically been taking more

923.04 --> 930.399
and taking it for granted

926.399 --> 933.199
and then yeah oh no

930.399 --> 934.88
i s and now i have to take that vaccine

933.199 --> 935.8389999999999
or those things that i've taken for

934.88 --> 939.4399999999999
granted

935.839 --> 955.839
can't have them anymore well maybe you

939.44 --> 955.839
planned it all wrong then

958.88 --> 962.24
that's right mitchell from australia if

960.88 --> 969.8389999999999
you don't rely on them

962.24 --> 969.839
they can't control you

974.0 --> 978.88
i think also that just people in

977.12 --> 981.44
waking up in the face of everything

978.88 --> 984.56
happening should really think

981.44 --> 987.519
carefully and feel out carefully

984.56 --> 988.7199999999999
don't jump to conclusions especially

987.519 --> 991.68
based on

988.72 --> 994.399
what groups are doing set your

991.68 --> 994.399
boundaries

994.88 --> 1002.24
like know what is

997.92 --> 1006.3199999999999
yours realize what could be taken

1002.24 --> 1006.88
and then prepare to basically let that

1006.32 --> 1010.9590000000001
happen

1006.88 --> 1014.32
and not take faxes or whatever

1010.959 --> 1015.92
go along to do it anyway

1014.32 --> 1017.6
you have to set these boundaries for

1015.92 --> 1021.4399999999999
yourself and just realize

1017.6 --> 1025.039
like okay this is what they could take

1021.44 --> 1028.48
so i'm going to avoid that

1025.039 --> 1031.839
and plan my life avoiding that

1028.48 --> 1034.64
and not get tempted for a quicker

1031.839 --> 1036.839
easier road that actually is a very

1034.64 --> 1039.8390000000002
deadly road

1036.839 --> 1039.839
right

1046.48 --> 1052.32
huh right agent yeah i do my best and

1049.52 --> 1055.28
i'm really all that infighting garbage

1052.32 --> 1055.28
i'm sick of it

1057.44 --> 1069.2
like i i really try to avoid that

1066.559 --> 1070.8799999999999
i'm trying to provide purpose here and

1069.2 --> 1074.0
clarity

1070.88 --> 1076.0
and nobody gives a [ __ ] about some

1074.0 --> 1078.08
couple of niche weirdos that are

1076.0 --> 1080.799
obviously out of control

1078.08 --> 1081.1999999999998
and what they do and me getting angry at

1080.799 --> 1084.08
them

1081.2 --> 1085.3600000000001
like suddenly very few people that

1084.08 --> 1088.0
actually care about that

1085.36 --> 1088.4799999999998
so by engaging i would be wasting my

1088.0 --> 1090.559
time

1088.48 --> 1093.3600000000001
now of course if i was particularly

1090.559 --> 1093.36
frustrated

1093.52 --> 1098.32
then i might latch onto it just so i get

1096.16 --> 1101.28
can blow off some steam

1098.32 --> 1109.12
and then try to move on right but i

1101.28 --> 1123.84
don't feel like that

1109.12 --> 1123.84
i feel pretty calm

1134.84 --> 1137.84
what

1139.6 --> 1144.3999999999999
really turned away from wow so you

1142.72 --> 1147.76
actually showed it to him and he

1144.4 --> 1150.16
he got all freaked out like he like he's

1147.76 --> 1165.84
seen a magician's trick

1150.16 --> 1165.8400000000001
yeah that is hilarious

1170.16 --> 1177.76
yeah no no

1173.76 --> 1181.44
the thing is mr troll

1177.76 --> 1181.44
we're just having a good time here

1185.039 --> 1191.28
and we don't want to waste our time on

1188.72 --> 1191.28
nonsense

1191.36 --> 1195.9189999999999
so we'll just continue talking about

1193.2 --> 1198.48
things that are actually interesting

1195.919 --> 1198.48
and fun

1200.24 --> 1209.679
hello julia pavin good to see you

1207.36 --> 1212.24
what do you drink green tea as always

1209.679 --> 1212.24
green tea

1212.72 --> 1216.799
unless it's really hot and then i might

1214.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
avoid green tea because it gives me a

1216.799 --> 1221.84
heat rash

1226.48 --> 1231.919
did you saw the flight from jeff bezos

1228.72 --> 1231.919
yeah yeah i saw it live

1233.039 --> 1249.84
like i was watching it live during the

1234.88 --> 1249.8400000000001
flat earth debates

1251.679 --> 1258.5590000000002
yeah by the way that was fun

1255.2 --> 1260.24
watching owen benjamin from yesterday's

1258.559 --> 1262.559
stream

1260.24 --> 1264.24
and or was known it was the day before

1262.559 --> 1267.039
about jeff bezos and it's

1264.24 --> 1270.0
like he he totally calls it he basically

1267.039 --> 1273.84
describes it the same way as i do

1270.0 --> 1276.08
it's just a giant squirt ritual

1273.84 --> 1277.039
he described it like the exact same way

1276.08 --> 1280.08
so

1277.039 --> 1284.4
but it's because it's it's just

1280.08 --> 1287.6
true how was it

1284.4 --> 1290.88
yeah as a spectacle it was

1287.6 --> 1291.4399999999998
it was okay but yeah it's a giant penis

1290.88 --> 1293.679
rocket

1291.44 --> 1293.679
and

1296.799 --> 1307.52
no accidents or anything

1305.679 --> 1310.3200000000002
i don't know overall i didn't think it

1307.52 --> 1313.52
was really super interesting

1310.32 --> 1319.84
and also the rocket landing it was kind

1313.52 --> 1319.84
of weird

1323.919 --> 1333.8400000000001
you don't mean me

1336.559 --> 1347.28
right slow-mo moon buggy yeah it is

1339.36 --> 1349.6
isn't it

1347.28 --> 1350.48
now owen by the way said that he's

1349.6 --> 1352.1589999999999
suspecting

1350.48 --> 1355.44
he might be on to something that there

1352.159 --> 1355.44
is a kind of a weird

1356.64 --> 1363.2
birthing ritual happening perhaps

1360.96 --> 1365.52
like allegedly trying to summon the

1363.2 --> 1369.039
antichrist

1365.52 --> 1374.0
through my magic or something might be

1369.039 --> 1376.32
going on

1374.0 --> 1379.36
so i wonder what's the next thing going

1376.32 --> 1382.72
to be or was this it

1379.36 --> 1389.84
or is there going to be some third thing

1382.72 --> 1389.84
and i wonder what that will be like

1393.36 --> 1403.84
were they higher than the other guy

1397.679 --> 1403.8400000000001
allegedly so they said

1406.72 --> 1417.84
did they show video from space no

1410.72 --> 1417.84
no they didn't

1424.559 --> 1428.3999999999999
the third thing could be fake space in

1427.039 --> 1431.44
oh yeah sure

1428.4 --> 1445.8400000000001
the fake space aliens it's

1431.44 --> 1445.8400000000001
it could be

1456.32 --> 1460.8799999999999
i wonder what the opening ceremony at

1458.559 --> 1463.279
the olympics is going to predict oh god

1460.88 --> 1463.279
yeah

1464.4 --> 1473.8400000000001
yeah they like to do that don't they

1490.4 --> 1494.5590000000002
oh okay that sounds great tony

1496.72 --> 1501.76
that's awesome that you can actually

1498.84 --> 1503.9189999999999
find

1501.76 --> 1505.52
find some connection in that on the

1503.919 --> 1514.88
working floor that's really

1505.52 --> 1518.1589999999999
that's really awesome

1514.88 --> 1518.159
hello andrew by the way

1520.0 --> 1523.2
i don't know what that specifically is

1522.799 --> 1529.84
john

1523.2 --> 1529.8400000000001
8 44.

1533.6 --> 1538.1589999999999
hopefully it's zombies in the opening

1535.6 --> 1540.9599999999998
ceremony maybe there will be trans facts

1538.159 --> 1543.8400000000001
zombies maybe they will literally just

1540.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
do that

1547.81 --> 1551.599
[Music]

1565.919 --> 1572.24
they still brandish the 2020 olympics

1568.32 --> 1572.24
right because it was postponed right

1572.799 --> 1589.44
very weird

1584.24 --> 1589.44
yeah hospital beds london ceremony

1592.08 --> 1595.12
dude but they had weird predictive [ __ ]

1594.24 --> 1598.64
like that even

1595.12 --> 1601.1999999999998
in in the 2012

1598.64 --> 1601.2
olympics

1604.0 --> 1610.48
that was already predicting like ooh

1606.72 --> 1610.48
there's going to be a virus and [ __ ]

1610.799 --> 1627.84
something like that something medical

1637.44 --> 1640.72
was there any footage from inside the

1639.76 --> 1642.96
capsule uh

1640.72 --> 1646.799
well now that you're saying it julie

1642.96 --> 1646.799
padman i haven't seen any of that

1652.84 --> 1655.84
nothing

1661.679 --> 1664.799
i mean maybe they did have at some point

1664.08 --> 1668.399
like a

1664.799 --> 1670.1589999999999
very short live shot from inside

1668.399 --> 1671.6789999999999
but i must have missed it if it was

1670.159 --> 1674.0800000000002
there i hadn't seen

1671.679 --> 1674.799
it at all and i think i've watched

1674.08 --> 1678.24
pretty much

1674.799 --> 1681.6
most of the event from launch

1678.24 --> 1683.84
to landing i don't remember seeing any

1681.6 --> 1683.84
inside

1694.84 --> 1697.84
footage

1728.159 --> 1733.3600000000001
huh yes julio pepin

1731.44 --> 1736.3990000000001
yeah well who knows man maybe they

1733.36 --> 1740.9599999999998
didn't record it because they want

1736.399 --> 1743.9189999999999
they want to screw around

1740.96 --> 1745.279
and do or maybe they already did like a

1743.919 --> 1748.48
trick

1745.279 --> 1751.679
footage and they just want to

1748.48 --> 1752.159
override that like them floating in

1751.679 --> 1754.3990000000001
space

1752.159 --> 1755.679
inside the capsule or something i don't

1754.399 --> 1758.2399999999998
know

1755.679 --> 1760.72
and then so they couldn't take any live

1758.24 --> 1763.84
footage from inside

1760.72 --> 1767.6000000000001
because that would ruin the

1763.84 --> 1770.0
the graft

1767.6 --> 1771.76
that would ruin the edit afterward i

1770.0 --> 1775.12
don't know this this just

1771.76 --> 1781.84
i don't know probably not

1775.12 --> 1781.84
seems a little silly

1789.36 --> 1792.84
yeah i i don't know why they wouldn't

1791.52 --> 1795.84
just record it

1792.84 --> 1795.84
either

1826.93 --> 1830.069
[Music]

1834.84 --> 1837.84
okay

1848.32 --> 1851.84
there's no crowd at the ceremony

1862.08 --> 1879.84
the horizon is not earth curve

1865.36 --> 1879.84
or another

1888.96 --> 1891.54
oh man you're getting hungry all of a

1890.88 --> 1893.519
sudden

1891.54 --> 1895.6789999999999
[Music]

1893.519 --> 1897.2
did the video you can see it yeah yeah

1895.679 --> 1901.2
it's not earth

1897.2 --> 1901.2
curve you understand

1901.679 --> 1905.8400000000001
just because it's roundish looking when

1904.32 --> 1909.84
you look through a window

1905.84 --> 1909.84
doesn't mean it's a sphere

1917.519 --> 1921.519
a dirt center it doesn't even need to be

1919.44 --> 1922.64
a wide angle lens it could just be the

1921.519 --> 1925.44
shape of the window

1922.64 --> 1926.24
whatever the thing is though that

1925.44 --> 1929.519
whatever

1926.24 --> 1932.48
it looks like it's not

1929.519 --> 1932.48
actually curved

1933.039 --> 1941.76
it's not physically curved right

1937.2 --> 1944.3990000000001
any visual rounding of the horizon

1941.76 --> 1945.279
is visual it's because of the medium

1944.399 --> 1949.12
you're looking through

1945.279 --> 1951.039
the window or it could be

1949.12 --> 1954.32
the camera lens well in that case it's

1951.039 --> 1957.039
also the window it is the lens

1954.32 --> 1959.039
that makes it look like that because the

1957.039 --> 1964.72
actual horizon

1959.039 --> 1964.72
is not curved it's pretty straight

1971.2 --> 1977.8400000000001
and it's not the edge of a sphere that

1973.12 --> 1977.84
blocks things behind it

2003.87 --> 2007.05
[Music]

2008.96 --> 2012.24
right well anyway i haven't seen any

2010.799 --> 2018.1589999999999
footage from inside

2012.24 --> 2021.1200000000001
the capsule during the supposed launch

2018.159 --> 2022.159
but i don't need to to draw some kind of

2021.12 --> 2025.039
a conclusion

2022.159 --> 2025.0390000000002
because i already know

2025.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
from seeing a lot of other footage as to

2027.44 --> 2033.8400000000001
how this works

2036.96 --> 2040.32
it's clearly round yeah yeah that's

2039.12 --> 2043.5189999999998
visually

2040.32 --> 2045.039
round it looks round it isn't round

2043.519 --> 2050.159
though

2045.039 --> 2054.96
it's a visual distortion you understand

2050.159 --> 2059.04
the horizon is not curved it's flat

2054.96 --> 2062.96
and it's not a geometric edge

2059.04 --> 2062.96
that blocks things behind it

2063.919 --> 2070.0
it's where the sky meets the ground

2067.359 --> 2073.44
where the resolution of your vision can

2070.0 --> 2076.639
no longer resolve it

2073.44 --> 2077.28
which effectively causes things which

2076.639 --> 2080.7200000000003
are much

2077.28 --> 2085.8390000000004
smaller in the distance at the horizon

2080.72 --> 2089.4399999999996
to effectively fold into the horizon

2085.839 --> 2092.7999999999997
because of your limited resolution

2089.44 --> 2103.839
it doesn't go behind the horizon it goes

2092.8 --> 2103.8390000000004
into the horizon

2114.64 --> 2119.68
the cult symbolism what cult symbolism

2128.839 --> 2131.839
andrew

2145.44 --> 2149.28
do i really have to respond to that

2151.28 --> 2154.88
shouldn't show no no it's not it

2153.839 --> 2158.599
shouldn't

2154.88 --> 2162.079
it doesn't show

2158.599 --> 2165.599
geometric curve

2162.079 --> 2168.7200000000003
the apparent curve you might observe

2165.599 --> 2171.28
is purely optical due to the medium

2168.72 --> 2172.64
you're looking through distorting the

2171.28 --> 2174.8
visuals

2172.64 --> 2176.64
that is what i said it's not it's not

2174.8 --> 2179.92
supposed to look curved no

2176.64 --> 2183.92
it isn't curvature

2179.92 --> 2187.839
whatever you're seeing is not geometric

2183.92 --> 2187.839
sphere curve

2188.24 --> 2191.7599999999998
that is what i said

2193.04 --> 2196.96
hey michael khan good to see you

2198.0 --> 2202.24
it should be visible yes i know yeah if

2200.48 --> 2204.16
the earth was a sphere

2202.24 --> 2205.2799999999997
then the curve should be visible that's

2204.16 --> 2208.3199999999997
correct

2205.28 --> 2211.119
however it is in this sphere and it is

2208.32 --> 2211.119
not visible

2211.52 --> 2219.599
it doesn't block things behind it

2214.8 --> 2219.599
behind the edge of the sphere that's not

2226.839 --> 2229.839
happening

2241.68 --> 2247.44
okay guys please

2244.96 --> 2247.44
insert

2250.64 --> 2253.92
something better to talk about because

2253.119 --> 2257.839
this is

2253.92 --> 2260.079
just annoying

2257.839 --> 2262.0789999999997
i i don't want to just go back and forth

2260.079 --> 2263.76
against the stupid fundy saying the same

2262.079 --> 2265.8390000000004
thing over and over again

2263.76 --> 2268.079
an hour i'll leave that to nathan when

2265.839 --> 2269.599
he feels like it

2268.079 --> 2273.76
i don't want to do that i don't want to

2269.599 --> 2276.56
waste my show on that sort of nonsense

2273.76 --> 2279.28
i've already given you everything you

2276.56 --> 2281.839
needed to know to figure out

2279.28 --> 2284.48
whatever you're going to see up there

2281.839 --> 2287.7599999999998
outside concerning the earth is not

2284.48 --> 2299.839
curvature it's not physical

2287.76 --> 2299.8390000000004
geometric curve

2310.839 --> 2313.839
laughs

2324.96 --> 2341.839
yeah yeah fat finger syndrome i know

2326.96 --> 2341.839
michael kong that's fine

2366.48 --> 2369.839
yep indeed seeking star wars hello by

2368.8 --> 2383.8390000000004
the way

2369.839 --> 2383.839
i'm gonna be back

2436.839 --> 2439.839
um

2442.72 --> 2445.839
sorry i really needed to chew on

2444.88 --> 2448.7200000000003
something my

2445.839 --> 2448.72
stomach was getting

2449.28 --> 2455.2000000000003
giving me the implosion feeling it's

2452.319 --> 2455.2
very distracting

2464.839 --> 2467.839
what

2472.88 --> 2481.839
oh come on mitchell from australia don't

2475.119 --> 2481.839
be that cheap

2485.119 --> 2495.839
do they really have a pizza on their

2486.96 --> 2495.839
shirt though that is kind of weird

2504.24 --> 2508.72
just don't try to let like any time you

2507.68 --> 2511.9199999999996
see a pizza

2508.72 --> 2515.2799999999997
immediately make you conclude like oh

2511.92 --> 2516.7200000000003
oh so that means it must have something

2515.28 --> 2520.2400000000002
to do with pedophilia

2516.72 --> 2524.0
right no pizza is actually kind of a

2520.24 --> 2526.3999999999996
pretty common dish worldwide

2524.0 --> 2527.44
i think it is very much associated with

2526.4 --> 2530.8
it italy

2527.44 --> 2530.8
right so

2531.04 --> 2538.64
how about you don't let your mind wander

2534.48 --> 2551.839
immediately in the dirtiest of the dirt

2538.64 --> 2551.839
that would be my advice

2559.92 --> 2567.28
not in italy man what

2563.839 --> 2579.839
were you saying the italian olympics

2567.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
team right

2594.88 --> 2597.119
hmm

2598.8 --> 2602.1600000000003
yeah seeking style water yeah italian

2600.8 --> 2604.4
pizza is great

2602.16 --> 2606.0789999999997
but it's also great because a lot people

2604.4 --> 2609.119
there have the habit of making

2606.079 --> 2611.8390000000004
it completely from scratch

2609.119 --> 2612.4
right they make the dough they bake the

2611.839 --> 2615.359
dough they

2612.4 --> 2615.359
do everything

2616.48 --> 2620.56
and that yeah that makes it extra

2619.04 --> 2624.079
special

2620.56 --> 2624.0789999999997
great fresh herbs all that

2632.0 --> 2635.44
what's the bite now by my friendship

2634.0 --> 2637.839
bracelet with the pizza

2635.44 --> 2637.839
what

2646.96 --> 2649.839
oh come on

2652.0 --> 2663.839
yeah i can't argue with that slo-mo moon

2654.24 --> 2663.839
buggy like what

2664.16 --> 2668.72
it is look if if like the

2670.56 --> 2674.24
the demon actors are doing it yet that

2673.359 --> 2676.24
does

2674.24 --> 2677.359
actually make it suspicious that's

2676.24 --> 2679.68
freaky

2677.359 --> 2681.119
like they better not be trying to like

2679.68 --> 2685.2
open signal

2681.119 --> 2689.04
their perversion specificity like that

2685.2 --> 2705.839
like they would actually just use that

2689.04 --> 2705.839
that's atrocious

2716.839 --> 2719.839
hmm

2749.599 --> 2755.28
huh one person not wearing a mask

2755.44 --> 2759.599
that's interesting well mitchell from

2758.079 --> 2760.7200000000003
australia there's certainly going to be

2759.599 --> 2764.56
a lot to look

2760.72 --> 2764.56
out for a lot of details

2764.64 --> 2767.68
but then again they do kind of make it

2767.28 --> 2771.0400000000004
into

2767.68 --> 2771.04
this game as well

2771.2 --> 2775.2799999999997
so don't get over obsessed over it

2773.76 --> 2777.76
because that happens too

2775.28 --> 2780.4
people just go completely ballistic and

2777.76 --> 2784.2400000000002
paranoia and then suddenly they see

2780.4 --> 2786.4
like pedophiles and like

2784.24 --> 2788.0
baby eaters and all that whatever

2786.4 --> 2789.76
disgusting thing you can imagine they

2788.0 --> 2791.359
suddenly start to see it everywhere

2789.76 --> 2794.96
right so it that

2791.359 --> 2794.96
is kind of an influence too

2797.2 --> 2803.839
they try to make you squirt and slide

2800.839 --> 2803.839
down

2804.96 --> 2820.56
so don't get too carried away with it uh

2817.52 --> 2823.28
oh michael khan you know the

2820.56 --> 2825.44
the fake space flights that aren't space

2823.28 --> 2828.0
flights just high altitude flights

2825.44 --> 2830.2400000000002
i'm not particularly tired of them you

2828.0 --> 2833.359
know i'm kind of neutral it's like

2830.24 --> 2836.4799999999996
yeah sure why not you know it's if

2833.359 --> 2836.48
that's what they want to do

2839.44 --> 2844.7200000000003
it's what i'm more tired of is a bunch

2842.079 --> 2847.28
of dumbass trolls out there

2844.72 --> 2848.9599999999996
that thinks it actually means some kind

2847.28 --> 2853.92
of a victory or something

2848.96 --> 2853.92
against flat earth that part is very

2856.839 --> 2859.839
tiresome

2876.64 --> 2880.64
the people who break down the ceremonies

2878.559 --> 2883.2000000000003
are intense

2880.64 --> 2885.2
that's one way of saying it you could

2883.2 --> 2889.7599999999998
also call it

2885.2 --> 2889.7599999999998
paranoid and insane

2889.92 --> 2895.6800000000003
overkill like

2893.28 --> 2897.6800000000003
trying to project the worst possible

2895.68 --> 2900.8799999999997
combination of ideas

2897.68 --> 2903.1189999999997
onto it that happens too

2900.88 --> 2904.079
i've seen some videos and they are just

2903.119 --> 2907.599
insane

2904.079 --> 2910.559
like don't listen to them

2907.599 --> 2911.52
and then literally believe them that is

2910.559 --> 2915.44
messed up

2911.52 --> 2919.119
that's very unhealthy to do

2915.44 --> 2920.88
but yes it is interesting to

2919.119 --> 2923.44
analyze what's happening and somebody

2920.88 --> 2926.6400000000003
that just sees a lot of details

2923.44 --> 2928.8
that can be interesting

2926.64 --> 2931.2799999999997
it's just that a lot of people that see

2928.8 --> 2932.96
a lot of details can also get very very

2931.28 --> 2937.28
caught up in extremely

2932.96 --> 2940.079
paranoid darkness

2937.28 --> 2940.96
and that part is not very rewarding not

2940.079 --> 2944.319
very healthy

2940.96 --> 2944.319
not for them either by the way

2945.92 --> 2951.28
so i don't typically like to watch those

2948.4 --> 2951.28
types of videos

2954.559 --> 2960.2400000000002
i'm not really much into paranoid

2956.48 --> 2960.2400000000002
conspiracy videos in general

2962.559 --> 2966.079
i don't know with my with i'm much more

2964.8 --> 2968.7200000000003
interested in mind

2966.079 --> 2970.2400000000002
building in actually figuring out

2968.72 --> 2976.0789999999997
reality i'm more interested

2970.24 --> 2979.4399999999996
in the in the natural world of the mind

2976.079 --> 2985.76
you know science of the mind

2979.44 --> 2988.64
you could say it

2985.76 --> 2990.6400000000003
and like what what is a good natural

2988.64 --> 2991.7599999999998
development what is a good position to

2990.64 --> 2993.52
take

2991.76 --> 2995.8390000000004
how do you distinguish how do you find

2993.52 --> 2997.52
that way through i'm not interested in

2995.839 --> 3000.319
how

2997.52 --> 3001.359
beyond our image imagination messed up

3000.319 --> 3004.64
things can be

3001.359 --> 3012.0789999999997
out there although i am

3004.64 --> 3015.2799999999997
interested to see like the consequences

3012.079 --> 3016.48
like i'm interested in the influence of

3015.28 --> 3019.3590000000004
breaking logos

3016.48 --> 3021.28
i'm interested basically in in logos in

3019.359 --> 3027.839
the structure of reality

3021.28 --> 3027.8390000000004
what things do to you

3029.04 --> 3032.72
and also how the consciousness plays

3031.04 --> 3036.319
tricks on you

3032.72 --> 3036.319
and can re yeah

3038.319 --> 3043.92
hide things from you while everybody

3040.72 --> 3043.9199999999996
thinks something about you

3045.04 --> 3048.24
the person then in themselves might just

3047.52 --> 3050.64
not be

3048.24 --> 3051.839
in that zone at all and not even realize

3050.64 --> 3054.8799999999997
that that's actually

3051.839 --> 3056.88
where they ended up they might

3054.88 --> 3057.599
misunderstand why people even think the

3056.88 --> 3060.1600000000003
way they do

3057.599 --> 3060.1600000000003
about them

3061.2 --> 3064.96
and that nobody is the wiser

3066.839 --> 3069.839
right

3074.4 --> 3077.599
do you think forced the line would work

3076.88 --> 3083.839
what

3077.599 --> 3083.839
what are you talking about al's g

3084.72 --> 3091.4399999999996
yes mitchell from australia yeah those

3088.4 --> 3093.6800000000003
the analysts usually are higher on the

3091.44 --> 3095.92
autistic spectrum

3093.68 --> 3111.839
and that also makes them more vulnerable

3095.92 --> 3111.839
to obsession

3115.04 --> 3119.2799999999997
if you could be on the moon and see the

3116.96 --> 3122.88
earth it would be around

3119.28 --> 3125.0400000000004
yeah if if you could be on the moon

3122.88 --> 3128.559
presuming that it is a physical place

3125.04 --> 3129.119
you could actually stand on if that were

3128.559 --> 3131.92
true

3129.119 --> 3134.2400000000002
then you're already basically forced to

3131.92 --> 3135.2000000000003
presuppose the entire heliocentric

3134.24 --> 3138.24
system

3135.2 --> 3139.5989999999997
yeah and if you were in a scenario where

3138.24 --> 3142.3999999999996
the heliocentric

3139.599 --> 3144.079
system was real and you were standing on

3142.4 --> 3144.8
the moon and looking at earth then yeah

3144.079 --> 3147.2000000000003
it would be

3144.8 --> 3150.0
round yeah because that's what's

3147.2 --> 3152.72
required in order for that situation to

3150.0 --> 3155.2
even virtually be possible that's

3152.72 --> 3155.2
correct

3156.319 --> 3161.839
however you can't stand on the moon

3159.76 --> 3163.6800000000003
it's not a physical place you can stand

3161.839 --> 3166.24
on

3163.68 --> 3167.9199999999996
and there is no altitude you could ever

3166.24 --> 3170.8799999999997
reach

3167.92 --> 3172.96
that would make the earth naturally

3170.88 --> 3177.76
without some kind of lens issue

3172.96 --> 3179.52
or whatever optical distortion

3177.76 --> 3182.4
there is no height that you could reach

3179.52 --> 3185.68
that would make it look like a ball

3182.4 --> 3195.839
that doesn't happen because the earth

3185.68 --> 3195.839
isn't a ball

3203.48 --> 3206.559
[Music]

3208.72 --> 3212.16
oh i'm gonna get more of that

3212.48 --> 3223.839
that green i love that stuff

3234.839 --> 3237.839
so

3276.839 --> 3279.839
um

3284.72 --> 3289.4399999999996
and i was not actually talking about

3286.799 --> 3293.839
green tea i still got plenty here

3289.44 --> 3293.839
just talking about this green stuff

3316.88 --> 3320.2400000000002
yeah mitchell our granite green tea is

3319.68 --> 3323.2799999999997
great

3320.24 --> 3325.52
but when you're hungry it doesn't really

3323.28 --> 3325.52
help

3325.839 --> 3330.88
i grow this no no i wish

3331.119 --> 3335.839
i wish i could

3338.88 --> 3345.28
i mean i have my own basil plants

3342.4 --> 3345.28
some parsley

3346.72 --> 3351.2
and some fresh orga oregano

3352.319 --> 3363.839
let's just pot it but i take good care

3354.48 --> 3363.839
of it

3373.01 --> 3377.8390000000004
[Music]

3374.839 --> 3377.839
hmm

3390.96 --> 3393.52
what's that

3395.68 --> 3398.799
server not found

3400.96 --> 3405.839
yeah that link doesn't work for me

3402.72 --> 3405.839
gaining wisdom

3423.04 --> 3425.599
hold on

3426.72 --> 3433.839
i think no no it doesn't work

3444.839 --> 3447.839
ah

3465.04 --> 3468.799
right now i actually have to go to the

3472.839 --> 3475.839
toilet

3514.839 --> 3517.839
um

3584.839 --> 3589.7599999999998
right so since you brought up plants

3590.079 --> 3594.88
i thought i'd show off my all this basil

3593.76 --> 3598.88
plant that i have

3594.88 --> 3602.7200000000003
with this crazy crazy flower

3598.88 --> 3602.7200000000003
stem just look at that thing

3604.96 --> 3615.839
now that's a lot of flowers

3609.44 --> 3615.839
i'm sure that properly

3617.04 --> 3620.24
look at that crazy thing

3620.4 --> 3631.76
like it doesn't even fit on the screen

3628.4 --> 3634.799
anyway this is a basil plant

3631.76 --> 3637.119
and yeah the flower of this one it got

3634.799 --> 3639.44
so enthusiastic

3637.119 --> 3640.559
like even the stems are turning kind of

3639.44 --> 3643.52
to wood

3640.559 --> 3643.92
but these things has one two three four

3643.52 --> 3646.88
five

3643.92 --> 3648.079
six seven eight nine ten eleven thirteen

3646.88 --> 3652.079
fifteen

3648.079 --> 3656.88
fourteen fifteen

3652.079 --> 3660.319
sixteen flower buds

3656.88 --> 3660.319
is it still making a new one

3661.44 --> 3665.839
right yeah i think it's actually even

3663.28 --> 3671.8390000000004
making more

3665.839 --> 3671.839
can it be ingested what the

3672.96 --> 3675.599
no i'm not going

3678.24 --> 3686.4799999999996
yo isles g

3683.2 --> 3688.799
that's disgusting dude that's really

3686.48 --> 3688.799
bad

3693.44 --> 3700.2400000000002
anyway yeah look at this thing it's all

3696.96 --> 3702.7200000000003
flowering and keeps on going and going

3700.24 --> 3702.72
and going

3703.68 --> 3709.2799999999997
so this is basically only for the view

3706.88 --> 3709.28
of it

3711.2 --> 3715.839
now of course i got some fresh basil

3713.28 --> 3718.559
plants that are more for harvesting

3715.839 --> 3719.2799999999997
because once they start blooming i just

3718.559 --> 3722.2400000000002
kind of like

3719.28 --> 3726.079
leave them it's like okay you earned

3722.24 --> 3728.16
your pension

3726.079 --> 3730.0
because yeah this wasn't originally just

3728.16 --> 3731.2
four plans this thing was like filled

3730.0 --> 3734.64
with what is it like

3731.2 --> 3735.0389999999998
30 i get really stacked in there and

3734.64 --> 3737.68
then

3735.039 --> 3737.6800000000003
eventually

3738.96 --> 3745.839
i leave a couple to retire

3743.76 --> 3755.8390000000004
just look at that freaking flower stem

3745.839 --> 3755.839
that's just crazy

3760.24 --> 3767.359
anyway i wanted to show that off

3763.76 --> 3770.6400000000003
in a bigger pot would do better

3767.359 --> 3773.92
probably but just look at it look how

3770.64 --> 3773.92
freaking small this is

3774.16 --> 3782.8799999999997
and then look how strong

3778.72 --> 3786.3999999999996
this plant is

3782.88 --> 3790.96
like this thing ain't breaking

3786.4 --> 3794.1600000000003
that's that's incredible

3790.96 --> 3797.839
this is just basil

3794.16 --> 3797.839
right oh it smells nice

3831.359 --> 3838.48
right and i'm definitely gonna

3835.28 --> 3841.76
show off my oregano plant

3838.48 --> 3845.599
it is blossoming like crazy too

3841.76 --> 3848.0
it's really beautiful of course it's not

3845.599 --> 3851.039
as strong as a basil plant

3848.0 --> 3853.76
but yeah this was originally

3851.039 --> 3855.119
my landlord actually threw this away in

3853.76 --> 3857.44
the garbage

3855.119 --> 3859.839
had to literally rescue it out of his

3857.44 --> 3859.839
truck

3860.079 --> 3863.6800000000003
and look what came out of that that it

3862.0 --> 3864.72
didn't have anything it was just a bunch

3863.68 --> 3866.72
of stems

3864.72 --> 3869.9199999999996
so he thought it was dead he didn't

3866.72 --> 3873.839
think about it he didn't actually look

3869.92 --> 3881.839
and this is the reward for rescuing

3873.839 --> 3881.839
look at that isn't that just lovely

3891.28 --> 3895.8390000000004
all right

3896.24 --> 3902.4799999999996
and there's more coming like he's really

3899.28 --> 3903.76
or she he or she whatever it is is

3902.48 --> 3909.839
really

3903.76 --> 3909.8390000000004
keeping it building new stems

3920.839 --> 3923.839
yay

3934.839 --> 3937.839
so

3976.839 --> 3979.839
so

3991.119 --> 3996.2400000000002
all right so since i'm gonna show you

3993.039 --> 4001.2000000000003
plants i'm gonna show you all of them

3996.24 --> 4001.2
so here's a a much younger basil plant

4002.0 --> 4007.839
that's not in bloom yet and it's still

4004.16 --> 4007.839
gonna be used see so this is

4008.319 --> 4014.5589999999997
oh it smells so good

4011.359 --> 4016.48
i wish you could smell that through the

4014.559 --> 4020.2400000000002
mic

4016.48 --> 4020.88
beautiful fresh they've grown quite a

4020.24 --> 4024.4799999999996
lot

4020.88 --> 4027.839
because as soon as you like take out

4024.48 --> 4029.68
plants and then as soon as possible as

4027.839 --> 4031.2799999999997
soon as the stems kind of get the signal

4029.68 --> 4033.44
like yeah you're dead

4031.28 --> 4034.559
then the roots do also release and then

4033.44 --> 4037.599
you just pluck them

4034.559 --> 4038.7200000000003
out in between and then by taking the

4037.599 --> 4043.28
roots of the

4038.72 --> 4046.5589999999997
used up basil plants out of there

4043.28 --> 4049.8390000000004
you make room literally like

4046.559 --> 4051.76
holes in the dirt with air and it makes

4049.839 --> 4052.5589999999997
it more fluffy the ground makes it more

4051.76 --> 4054.88
fluffy

4052.559 --> 4056.4
and that actually encourages the roots

4054.88 --> 4058.2400000000002
to grow

4056.4 --> 4061.52
just as long as you're careful that when

4058.24 --> 4063.9199999999996
you pull a stem out you don't damage

4061.52 --> 4065.92
other routes as you do it let me do it

4063.92 --> 4068.96
right here

4065.92 --> 4073.52
see this one should be yeah

4068.96 --> 4077.52
just like that see just pull it out

4073.52 --> 4080.64
don't be too much in a hurry

4077.52 --> 4083.92
and then suddenly plants surrounding it

4080.64 --> 4087.2
have all this extra root space

4083.92 --> 4087.2000000000003
they grow even faster

4087.359 --> 4090.96
so that's how i use basil and then of

4089.359 --> 4094.4
course there's my parsley

4090.96 --> 4098.159
bush i don't eat as much

4094.4 --> 4101.6
of it but you constantly gotta trim out

4098.159 --> 4101.599999999999
the yellowy

4101.759 --> 4108.159
leaves and water them like crazy

4105.199 --> 4109.2789999999995
water this whole thing like a madman

4108.159 --> 4113.12
because if you

4109.279 --> 4113.120000000001
don't take out the old leaves

4114.319 --> 4117.6
and you don't water it enough it

4115.839 --> 4119.679
suddenly starts to die or

4117.6 --> 4121.1990000000005
grow fungi and then it's completely

4119.679 --> 4123.759
useless

4121.199 --> 4125.759
but it took extra care with this

4123.759 --> 4126.88
particular plant to prevent that from

4125.759 --> 4129.6
happening so i could

4126.88 --> 4133.839
have a little bit more use of it it's

4129.6 --> 4133.839
working out just great

4134.48 --> 4139.5199999999995
i like gardening guys i really really do

4139.92 --> 4145.87
i really wish i had one more than just

4143.6 --> 4148.719
a shelf in the kitchen

4145.87 --> 4151.12
[Music]

4148.719 --> 4151.12
anyway

4152.56 --> 4158.159000000001
pinch the tip prevent early no but i

4155.679 --> 4159.839
don't want to

4158.159 --> 4162.0
i don't want to pinch the tip of my

4159.839 --> 4166.96
basil plants

4162.0 --> 4166.96
i just need to eat it

4168.159 --> 4171.759
so i put this on pizza

4171.839 --> 4176.48
oh so good fresh basil

4176.64 --> 4179.759
in between like the

4179.92 --> 4183.839
the tomato concentrate

4184.159 --> 4189.199
and of course some other stuff in there

4185.839 --> 4190.159
as well i use it in my spaghetti sauce

4189.199 --> 4193.04
then i usually

4190.159 --> 4195.599999999999
like in my spaghetti sauce like this

4193.04 --> 4199.12
entire bushel would probably disappear

4195.6 --> 4200.88
bar maybe one plant or two

4199.12 --> 4203.84
i always leave like at least three

4200.88 --> 4203.84
plants

4207.12 --> 4213.92
but anytime there is something tomato

4211.04 --> 4216.159
like cooked or fresh i'd like to involve

4213.92 --> 4218.64
basil because they had these plants have

4216.159 --> 4221.36
a distinct synergy

4218.64 --> 4222.159000000001
by the way that also counts for the what

4221.36 --> 4224.4
the roots do

4222.159 --> 4226.159
like the roots of tomato plants and the

4224.4 --> 4229.199
roots of basil

4226.159 --> 4233.36
like work together like clockwork they

4229.199 --> 4235.5199999999995
literally enhance each the each other

4233.36 --> 4236.88
so if you put them together they grow

4235.52 --> 4239.120000000001
better both of them

4236.88 --> 4242.4800000000005
than when you would plant them

4239.12 --> 4245.12
separately it's very interesting

4242.48 --> 4245.5199999999995
and yeah if i'd ever get like a sort of

4245.12 --> 4249.599999999999
a

4245.52 --> 4251.360000000001
small greenhouse or whatever in a garden

4249.6 --> 4253.280000000001
then one of the first things i would do

4251.36 --> 4255.44
is like ah

4253.28 --> 4256.96
put the basil in there and fill the

4255.44 --> 4259.199
whole place with basil

4256.96 --> 4260.159
i love basil can't get enough of it it's

4259.199 --> 4262.08
always good

4260.159 --> 4263.36
i've never had like oh god i wish you

4262.08 --> 4268.5599999999995
didn't have that basil

4263.36 --> 4270.96
no it's always good it never goes wrong

4268.56 --> 4272.2390000000005
i mean if you constantly chew down on it

4270.96 --> 4274.4
you might get a little

4272.239 --> 4276.159
sick of the taste eventually like with

4274.4 --> 4280.0
everything but

4276.159 --> 4282.4
it never gave me a bad response

4280.0 --> 4283.6
and regular tomato is also pretty

4282.4 --> 4287.839999999999
healthy for me

4283.6 --> 4287.84
never had issues with that

4292.64 --> 4295.679
companion planting right so i would then

4295.04 --> 4298.48
just put

4295.679 --> 4300.8
basil on the floor and put the tomato

4298.48 --> 4303.199
plants in between maybe

4300.8 --> 4304.88
red chili pepper like all of those

4303.199 --> 4307.5199999999995
combine great

4304.88 --> 4308.88
you know you there's just certain sets

4307.52 --> 4311.120000000001
of plants that you

4308.88 --> 4312.4800000000005
we that i typically like to use in my

4311.12 --> 4314.5599999999995
cooking that just

4312.48 --> 4316.239
really thrive together and that's what i

4314.56 --> 4319.04
want to just want to keep it basic

4316.239 --> 4321.44
for starters just provide myself with

4319.04 --> 4321.44
herbs

4323.679 --> 4328.0
yeah and also very important to me i

4326.32 --> 4331.84
love doing it i love

4328.0 --> 4335.84
these plants i love them sometimes it

4331.84 --> 4336.2390000000005
like i really as like owen benjamin and

4335.84 --> 4338.4800000000005
of course

4336.239 --> 4339.678999999999
others described like oh you slaughter

4338.48 --> 4342.32
an animal

4339.679 --> 4343.679
and then you might especially at first

4342.32 --> 4347.36
feel guilty

4343.679 --> 4349.76
about killing it right well i have that

4347.36 --> 4351.599999999999
with plants i actually feel guilty i

4349.76 --> 4355.04
have to fight that

4351.6 --> 4357.84
but it's because i just

4355.04 --> 4357.84
feel them

4359.44 --> 4363.5199999999995
so now sometimes i kind of like have to

4362.239 --> 4365.919999999999
prepare them like oh

4363.52 --> 4366.8
i'm gonna have a meal some of you are

4365.92 --> 4370.2390000000005
gonna buy it

4366.8 --> 4373.4400000000005
prepare yourselves

4370.239 --> 4373.839999999999
and that does help i guess it helps more

4373.44 --> 4377.44
than

4373.84 --> 4381.360000000001
if you just randomly ripped something

4377.44 --> 4381.36
off because you felt like it in a moment

4383.199 --> 4389.759999999999
yeah i'm

4386.239 --> 4393.678999999999
always nitpicking on the plans always

4389.76 --> 4393.679
getting those things out of there

4395.84 --> 4402.4890000000005
maybe that should be my eventual setup

4399.29 --> 4402.489
[Music]

4403.6 --> 4407.92
man if i'd have a greenhouse i'd do my

4406.32 --> 4411.84
live streams in there

4407.92 --> 4414.64
just like big bed big bear would

4411.84 --> 4414.64
his goat pen

4419.52 --> 4431.84
because just feel more energy

4426.8 --> 4431.84
it's like this is my crowd now

4439.679 --> 4441.84
right

4450.0 --> 4455.84
good stuff

4456.719 --> 4469.84
all right so i'm gonna put them back

4525.76 --> 4528.08
right

4529.04 --> 4535.04
yeah rob h i agree

4532.08 --> 4538.159
for me the same and even in the past

4535.04 --> 4542.08
when i was kind of like a lazy bastard

4538.159 --> 4545.12
and arrogant talking teens

4542.08 --> 4547.84
like i don't want to do [ __ ] but well if

4545.12 --> 4550.48
it's working in the garden

4547.84 --> 4552.0
yeah then i then i would just do it

4550.48 --> 4554.879999999999
because i actually like doing

4552.0 --> 4558.08
that even then i just felt like this is

4554.88 --> 4561.92
rewarding i i'm good at this

4558.08 --> 4561.92
because i love it and i get it

4565.199 --> 4569.36
it's just that eventually when my

4568.56 --> 4573.360000000001
parents

4569.36 --> 4574.88
no longer really took good care of the

4573.36 --> 4576.88
garden because they had

4574.88 --> 4578.0
they went their own separate ways and

4576.88 --> 4579.36
had issues

4578.0 --> 4581.04
they didn't have attention for the

4579.36 --> 4583.36
garden and then it was like

4581.04 --> 4585.36
okay so that means you have to now do

4583.36 --> 4586.96
the maintenance

4585.36 --> 4588.799999999999
and that kind of ruined because then i

4586.96 --> 4590.96
just had to do everything

4588.8 --> 4594.4800000000005
when they were not really interested so

4590.96 --> 4597.12
like the spirit just kind of

4594.48 --> 4599.678999999999
went away and then i didn't want to do

4597.12 --> 4599.679
it anymore

4601.199 --> 4604.96
and then not too long after my mother

4603.12 --> 4605.76
died and then the house was sold and i

4604.96 --> 4608.08
don't know what

4605.76 --> 4608.96
it stated if there even is a garden or

4608.08 --> 4610.719
if they paved it

4608.96 --> 4613.12
all or something terrible like that i

4610.719 --> 4613.12
don't know

4613.679 --> 4617.1990000000005
but it used to be an amazing garden when

4616.64 --> 4620.719
my

4617.199 --> 4623.44
mother and my father were actually

4620.719 --> 4625.679
working on it together when they cared

4623.44 --> 4626.4
it was amazing it was a little paradise

4625.679 --> 4629.679
it really

4626.4 --> 4632.0
was i've had dreams about that garden

4629.679 --> 4635.28
what it was like

4632.0 --> 4635.6
for decades sometimes they still come by

4635.28 --> 4637.679
but

4635.6 --> 4640.08
yeah in the last years they've been

4637.679 --> 4641.1990000000005
mostly just extremely nostalgic because

4640.08 --> 4643.679
it's lost

4641.199 --> 4644.719
it was lost to me when i was young i

4643.679 --> 4647.1990000000005
thought that i would be

4644.719 --> 4649.28
that this was that it was our castle

4647.199 --> 4651.839999999999
that that house and the garden was our

4649.28 --> 4651.84
castle

4651.92 --> 4655.04
and that i was going to be able to live

4653.28 --> 4658.159
there forever and i

4655.04 --> 4660.08
was wrong and it was a kind of a big

4658.159 --> 4662.08
disappointment

4660.08 --> 4665.84
you know my parents are not both dead my

4662.08 --> 4665.84
mother is though

4668.48 --> 4679.839999999999
for a long time 16 years

4704.4 --> 4707.839999999999
king's foil

4714.64 --> 4718.4800000000005
yeah open benjamin said something about

4716.719 --> 4721.84
weeds it's really funny

4718.48 --> 4724.239
like oh we call them a weed because

4721.84 --> 4726.159000000001
they're tenacious and they won't go away

4724.239 --> 4728.32
but you'll

4726.159 --> 4732.0
when you research more carefully you'll

4728.32 --> 4735.28
find that a lot of weeds are just edible

4732.0 --> 4736.08
so should you even be calling them weeds

4735.28 --> 4738.96
when they're just

4736.08 --> 4742.4
edible non-toxic non-destructive plants

4738.96 --> 4742.4
they're just very tenacious

4746.84 --> 4749.84
right

4760.84 --> 4763.84
uh

4764.239 --> 4777.759999999999
what no x-ray to any i don't know about

4769.28 --> 4779.36
such things i don't

4777.76 --> 4791.84
that's messed up where did where the

4779.36 --> 4791.839999999999
hell did that happen

4811.12 --> 4814.48
got a piece of lattice in between my

4812.639 --> 4819.84
teeth super annoying

4814.48 --> 4819.839999999999
whatever i'll survive

4827.6 --> 4833.84
california oh okay

4837.84 --> 4846.32
so you use any type of memory techniques

4842.719 --> 4861.84
i don't know i might be i'm not really

4846.32 --> 4861.84
conscious about it if i do

4886.84 --> 4889.84
so

4893.44 --> 4903.839999999999
wait what

4907.84 --> 4914.159000000001
are you sure that is real x320

4911.04 --> 4914.159
that sounds highly

4915.12 --> 4919.679
that sounds like a made-up thing

4927.199 --> 4932.799999999999
there is no temperature of space or

4930.239 --> 4932.799999999999
another

4937.04 --> 4947.44
there is no space

4944.32 --> 4947.44
it's real okay

4956.84 --> 4961.679
google

4959.199 --> 4964.5599999999995
so what told you that it is real that

4961.679 --> 4964.56
you actually see

4965.36 --> 4970.639
you see the fires

4968.4 --> 4971.599999999999
but how do you what how do you know that

4970.639 --> 4973.679
is actually

4971.6 --> 4976.719
has anything to do with the gender

4973.679 --> 4976.719
reveal party

4978.32 --> 4982.08
in order to build down what

4982.239 --> 4987.839999999999
22 000 acres

4988.4 --> 5001.839999999999
wasn't it already just burning

5009.52 --> 5012.8
they burned stuff oh they were having

5012.0 --> 5014.48
like a

5012.8 --> 5016.4800000000005
a campfire and then it got out of

5014.48 --> 5017.44
control because everybody was a [ __ ]

5016.48 --> 5029.839999999999
[ __ ]

5017.44 --> 5029.839999999999
and gay was that it

5039.36 --> 5045.92
okay is that the news article aj

5042.56 --> 5047.1990000000005
oh that's a picture okay that doesn't

5045.92 --> 5048.96
mean anything

5047.199 --> 5057.839999999999
that's just a picture that could even be

5048.96 --> 5057.84
a picture in a movie

5082.8 --> 5086.56
look into it yeah well you're not really

5085.52 --> 5099.4400000000005
giving me a lot to

5086.56 --> 5103.4400000000005
look into it's just a picture

5099.44 --> 5103.44
maybe it'll come by on the news

5109.76 --> 5122.56
let's see maybe rt's got something

5124.84 --> 5127.84
hmm

5138.84 --> 5141.84
nope

5152.88 --> 5158.32
it was big news when it happened when

5155.44 --> 5158.32
when was that

5164.56 --> 5171.329000000001
oh god now you're making me [ __ ]

5168.22 --> 5171.329000000001
[Music]

5173.84 --> 5180.400000000001
i hate googling that type of word

5177.76 --> 5181.1990000000005
because i don't want it to think i'm

5180.4 --> 5197.839999999999
interested

5181.199 --> 5197.839999999999
in the slightest

5198.08 --> 5211.84
two days ago

5227.199 --> 5230.239
oh [ __ ] off

5230.96 --> 5239.84
oh yeah yeah that means i'm not gonna

5234.0 --> 5239.84
look at you

5251.199 --> 5253.839999999999
right well

5261.44 --> 5267.839999999999
okay let me read this article

5268.56 --> 5271.52
a smoke bomb

5271.6 --> 5281.84
started ablaze did they started outside

5285.199 --> 5290.599999999999
five september dude okay

5288.639 --> 5291.92
so that's

5290.6 --> 5295.84
[Music]

5291.92 --> 5295.84
last year

5295.92 --> 5302.4800000000005
so this news article is basically about

5298.96 --> 5305.92
them being charged

5302.48 --> 5308.959999999999
for causing it months and months later

5305.92 --> 5310.719
half a year later more than half a year

5308.96 --> 5311.679
that that's basically what the article

5310.719 --> 5316.0
is about so

5311.679 --> 5316.0
this didn't happen recently at all

5320.84 --> 5323.84
okay

5334.4 --> 5337.839999999999
all right

5338.239 --> 5351.839999999999
now i know

5369.04 --> 5374.08
well agm yes directed energy weapons

5371.84 --> 5374.08
have

5374.159 --> 5381.599999999999
allegedly but obviously been used

5379.04 --> 5383.44
in basically disintegrating entire

5381.6 --> 5386.88
villages

5383.44 --> 5390.96
houses and cars alike

5386.88 --> 5392.0
but there's no reason to believe that

5390.96 --> 5395.44
that is involved

5392.0 --> 5395.44
in this specific thing

5395.6 --> 5401.4400000000005
although maybe it just got pinned on

5397.679 --> 5403.4400000000005
them maybe they're just the scapegoats

5401.44 --> 5404.839999999999
it all depends i didn't see any pictures

5403.44 --> 5408.719
of this

5404.84 --> 5411.1990000000005
place where they were doing this party

5408.719 --> 5413.04
like did they do it in a house it's like

5411.199 --> 5415.12
nothing in the article revealed any

5413.04 --> 5417.5199999999995
details of that

5415.12 --> 5419.84
it just said no a smoke bomb the smoke

5417.52 --> 5423.040000000001
bomb sparked and caused a fire

5419.84 --> 5435.84
that's like not a lot of data it's not a

5423.04 --> 5435.84
lot of precision

5443.36 --> 5447.839999999999
right so yeah we're on the same track

5445.6 --> 5450.96
there again

5447.84 --> 5454.8
it could be a scapegoat thing because

5450.96 --> 5458.719
there seems to be no sign whatsoever

5454.8 --> 5461.04
that mainstream anything politics media

5458.719 --> 5462.96
anything anything out there in the big

5461.04 --> 5467.92
machine

5462.96 --> 5470.56
is willing to even address these

5467.92 --> 5471.92
directed energy weapons installed on

5470.56 --> 5474.88
helicopters

5471.92 --> 5476.32
right i did a show week ago addressing

5474.88 --> 5482.159000000001
that

5476.32 --> 5482.159
well this thing is so such a hot potato

5482.48 --> 5488.159
that like nobody

5485.92 --> 5489.84
really wants to like everybody is

5488.159 --> 5490.96
nervous as [ __ ] it's almost like

5489.84 --> 5493.679
recognizing they

5490.96 --> 5494.08
exist almost brings up the fear that

5493.679 --> 5496.4800000000005
they

5494.08 --> 5498.639
freaking helicopters will come and just

5496.48 --> 5500.0
disintegrate them in their house

5498.639 --> 5501.92
while they're sleeping at night or

5500.0 --> 5504.08
something because

5501.92 --> 5506.96
it is a very scared idea that these

5504.08 --> 5506.96
things are out there

5508.159 --> 5515.36
and it's it's just not being addressed

5511.88 --> 5517.679
whatsoever people that are really trying

5515.36 --> 5520.719
to make it into a news they just get

5517.679 --> 5523.4400000000005
deleted just gone like

5520.719 --> 5523.44
erase it

5526.0 --> 5530.639
like even worse than counter corona data

5529.679 --> 5533.84
and all that

5530.639 --> 5535.6
doctors against corona get more get

5533.84 --> 5538.159000000001
through better than

5535.6 --> 5538.88
people actually trying to do in detail

5538.159 --> 5542.5599999999995
reports

5538.88 --> 5545.1990000000005
on the yeah directed energy weapon

5542.56 --> 5547.120000000001
helicopters disintegrating entire

5545.199 --> 5549.919999999999
villages like

5547.12 --> 5550.88
that's just completely off the map

5549.92 --> 5561.84
that's like

5550.88 --> 5561.84
high sensitivity ben

5571.76 --> 5575.84
there's a video of how it happened

5577.679 --> 5580.159
really

5587.12 --> 5592.08
okay well in that case if there's like a

5590.32 --> 5598.239
live video of it happening

5592.08 --> 5598.239
yeah then then it's kind of obvious

5600.0 --> 5606.4
although it still might be look

5603.6 --> 5608.56
what isn't what's better than a real

5606.4 --> 5609.04
fire being caused by a bunch of dumb

5608.56 --> 5612.4800000000005
asses

5609.04 --> 5613.28
on camera to basically take the fall and

5612.48 --> 5615.919999999999
cover for

5613.28 --> 5617.84
actual helicopters with direct energy

5615.92 --> 5620.639
weapons just disintegrating entire

5617.84 --> 5624.08
villages and cars alike

5620.639 --> 5628.32
what better to cover to

5624.08 --> 5630.88
replace it with hey a cause of fires

5628.32 --> 5632.719
so you stop looking in your mind for

5630.88 --> 5633.6
what is causing all these fires and it's

5632.719 --> 5637.76
like oh no oh

5633.6 --> 5639.92
this party caused the fire

5637.76 --> 5642.0
so then you like the amount of

5639.92 --> 5643.92
questioning in your mind in reflection

5642.0 --> 5645.52
on that will be less towards like oh

5643.92 --> 5648.639
what is causing the fire well

5645.52 --> 5650.2390000000005
so on the news this caused fire right so

5648.639 --> 5652.32
the amount of questions in your mind

5650.239 --> 5658.0
left as to what causes fire

5652.32 --> 5661.12
is decreased that way

5658.0 --> 5662.0
and what better than an actual fire

5661.12 --> 5664.5599999999995
started

5662.0 --> 5666.88
with proof on camera live as it happens

5664.56 --> 5666.88
you know

5671.52 --> 5676.080000000001
yeah or another i'm not denying

5674.56 --> 5677.92
that there's a video and that they

5676.08 --> 5681.5199999999995
actually caused it

5677.92 --> 5682.88
it may still be a convenient cover story

5681.52 --> 5684.88
to make people stop

5682.88 --> 5700.96
asking questions in their mind as to

5684.88 --> 5702.4800000000005
what's been causing all these fires

5700.96 --> 5706.2390000000005
right because there have been a lot of

5702.48 --> 5706.239
fires in california a lot

5706.96 --> 5711.679
crazy amounts and like gross

5712.84 --> 5715.84
mismanagement

5715.92 --> 5719.76
like blatantly obviously on purpose like

5718.8 --> 5722.639
to destroy

5719.76 --> 5724.639
everything like the management fire

5722.639 --> 5726.8
management in general in california i've

5724.639 --> 5727.4400000000005
heard some really terrible stories about

5726.8 --> 5730.0
it i can't

5727.44 --> 5731.5199999999995
beget in detail because i don't remember

5730.0 --> 5734.0
it

5731.52 --> 5735.84
i just know that there's been like gross

5734.0 --> 5740.08
negligence and even

5735.84 --> 5740.08
high suspicion of firemen literally

5741.36 --> 5746.239
just starting fires like oh they gather

5744.4 --> 5750.08
here

5746.239 --> 5751.919999999999
then supposedly to do a controlled burn

5750.08 --> 5753.44
off right which is a sensible thing to

5751.92 --> 5755.4400000000005
do

5753.44 --> 5757.678999999999
but then it all turns into a giant

5755.44 --> 5760.0
forest fire so it's like yeah

5757.679 --> 5762.08
why would that be could it be because

5760.0 --> 5765.04
they didn't actually do it the way

5762.08 --> 5765.04
they're supposed to do

5768.08 --> 5772.159
gross negligence mismanagement

5773.36 --> 5778.0
right and then the freaking d yeah

5775.76 --> 5778.88
directed energy weapon helicopters on

5778.0 --> 5781.92
top of that

5778.88 --> 5782.88
also disintegrating [ __ ] right so

5781.92 --> 5799.84
there's a combination

5782.88 --> 5799.84
fires from all sides

5802.239 --> 5806.32
right arson is red-handed starting fires

5804.96 --> 5810.159
well it's even been

5806.32 --> 5812.159
well done didn't they

5810.159 --> 5816.239
it's it's actually been like through

5812.159 --> 5818.719
social media being encouraged to do that

5816.239 --> 5819.919999999999
remember during the trump days there

5818.719 --> 5821.76
were just like yeah

5819.92 --> 5824.159
burn it all down just destroy the

5821.76 --> 5828.159000000001
country to make him look bad

5824.159 --> 5828.159
that sort of [ __ ] also happened

5830.48 --> 5834.4
it then out all of that [ __ ] kind of

5832.4 --> 5836.48
stopped because trump

5834.4 --> 5837.5199999999995
yeah his elections were stolen so he's

5836.48 --> 5841.04
supposedly not

5837.52 --> 5842.2390000000005
president but when he was yeah that sort

5841.04 --> 5845.5199999999995
of [ __ ] did get

5842.239 --> 5849.28
put out like attack him and

5845.52 --> 5851.119000000001
burn it down anything to stop him

5849.28 --> 5852.719
anything to make him look bad yeah

5851.119 --> 5855.199
including arson

5852.719 --> 5857.6
encouraging arson yeah i remember that

5855.199 --> 5857.599999999999
happening

5859.84 --> 5864.639
no i'm just stating facts of what

5862.159 --> 5864.638999999999
happened

5865.36 --> 5869.599999999999
you you think i'm a pro trumper why

5867.36 --> 5874.88
don't you look through the hashtags

5869.6 --> 5874.88
little troll little fishing troll

5875.92 --> 5880.159
what you thought you could plant a flag

5877.92 --> 5880.159
here

5880.8 --> 5884.400000000001
once you look in the hashtags

5890.7 --> 5893.849999999999
[Music]

5894.84 --> 5900.68
dumbass

5897.17 --> 5900.68
[Music]

5908.0 --> 5911.6
hey young silly people no michael khan

5910.88 --> 5915.36
that

5911.6 --> 5918.4800000000005
that is ridiculous no

5915.36 --> 5921.599999999999
why the hell would you pay

5918.48 --> 5924.239
leave a money trail to a crime

5921.6 --> 5926.400000000001
when you can just use the political

5924.239 --> 5929.44
insanity and hysteria

5926.4 --> 5930.719
to just motivate somebody to in a

5929.44 --> 5932.799999999999
specifically

5930.719 --> 5934.4800000000005
specific way go out of control because

5932.8 --> 5937.679
they feel like it

5934.48 --> 5941.599999999999
yeah you gotta pay them

5937.679 --> 5945.6
you literally leave a giant marker

5941.6 --> 5949.76
with yeah i paid somebody to do crime

5945.6 --> 5949.76
uh no

5950.239 --> 5954.48
they probably did not pay somebody to do

5952.96 --> 5957.199
it they probably just

5954.48 --> 5967.839999999999
riled them up until they just did it

5957.199 --> 5967.839999999999
because they wanted to

5970.88 --> 5974.639
remember that there was even a crazy

5972.639 --> 5976.639
time there were videos i remember them

5974.639 --> 5980.159000000001
coming by in alex jones where

5976.639 --> 5981.04
hobos would be caught on camera just

5980.159 --> 5984.719
trying to set

5981.04 --> 5987.679
fires in the middle of the summer

5984.719 --> 5988.2390000000005
like literally just with the lighter

5987.679 --> 5990.32
trying to

5988.239 --> 5991.5199999999995
light a bush on fire in the middle of

5990.32 --> 5994.0
the city

5991.52 --> 5994.639
or in a park and it would be on camera

5994.0 --> 5997.119
and [ __ ]

5994.639 --> 5999.04
like i remember that that literally

5997.119 --> 6003.04
happened it's on record they

5999.04 --> 6005.44
that happened crazy hobo setting [ __ ] on

6003.04 --> 6005.44
fire

6005.52 --> 6009.84
on camera

6018.48 --> 6022.0
yeah it's just climate change yeah yeah

6020.639 --> 6024.88
it's it's the

6022.0 --> 6026.159
social climate change the social climate

6024.88 --> 6029.679
change

6026.159 --> 6033.5199999999995
is causing fires because people are

6029.679 --> 6035.52
going nuts and setting fires because

6033.52 --> 6036.88
they've been somehow convinced that

6035.52 --> 6038.320000000001
that's the right thing to do

6036.88 --> 6040.719
yeah that's what happened there was a

6038.32 --> 6044.159
social climate change

6040.719 --> 6047.92
and it caused the fires

6044.159 --> 6051.839999999999
[ __ ] started to burn down not because

6047.92 --> 6055.1990000000005
man made influence environmental no it's

6051.84 --> 6059.28
social climate change

6055.199 --> 6062.4
the internal workings of men were

6059.28 --> 6065.599999999999
polluted diluted until man would be

6062.4 --> 6068.48
crazy enough to just

6065.6 --> 6070.400000000001
start to attack the environment and

6068.48 --> 6072.718999999999
that's what caused the real climate

6070.4 --> 6072.719
change

6076.88 --> 6093.84
it's man-made social climate change i

6079.6 --> 6093.84
like that i'm gonna use that as a title

6096.96 --> 6104.4
i really like that that's a great title

6102.08 --> 6107.84
definitely worthy making a note for

6104.4 --> 6107.839999999999
tomorrow's show i guess

6127.44 --> 6132.239
okay well hey george sanford if you know

6129.6 --> 6135.679
any other way that

6132.239 --> 6140.159
buildings and cars could burn down

6135.679 --> 6143.52
and literally burn up the metal

6140.159 --> 6147.5199999999995
like melt it in pools while

6143.52 --> 6151.4400000000005
trees not even 5 meters away

6147.52 --> 6153.6
are perfectly unscathed intact

6151.44 --> 6155.638999999999
next to the house next to those burned

6153.6 --> 6156.96
down cars that were literally

6155.639 --> 6160.08
disintegrated

6156.96 --> 6163.92
with puddles of metal

6160.08 --> 6166.08
on the ground entire bricks

6163.92 --> 6167.84
this interior it's not just a fire now

6166.08 --> 6170.48
literally the whole thing

6167.84 --> 6173.1990000000005
to the ground disintegrate if you know

6170.48 --> 6174.0
any natural way that can happen here at

6173.199 --> 6178.0
sanford

6174.0 --> 6180.08
please tell me about it like to know

6178.0 --> 6181.28
because as far as i know the only other

6180.08 --> 6183.679
thing which would be extremely

6181.28 --> 6184.8
convoluted to even attempt getting close

6183.679 --> 6188.08
to that

6184.8 --> 6189.04
is massive stockpiles of thermite like

6188.08 --> 6190.8
literally

6189.04 --> 6193.28
bury the whole thing in thermite and

6190.8 --> 6195.84
light it on fire

6193.28 --> 6197.5199999999995
and what am i talking about that's not

6195.84 --> 6198.639
that's not even correct because that

6197.52 --> 6201.1990000000005
would definitely

6198.639 --> 6205.84
cause the surroundings to catch fire

6201.199 --> 6205.839999999999
including the trees right so

6211.92 --> 6218.96
yeah so if you can explain to me

6215.28 --> 6222.4
how that can naturally happen without

6218.96 --> 6233.6
directed energy weapons please

6222.4 --> 6235.679
let me know george sanford

6233.6 --> 6236.88
oh you were playing as devil's advocate

6235.679 --> 6247.84
hmm

6236.88 --> 6247.84
all right i i fell for it

6258.84 --> 6263.679
so

6260.56 --> 6267.280000000001
yeah george sanford most metals have a

6263.679 --> 6267.28
really high melting point

6268.639 --> 6274.639
i know from experience because i've

6270.639 --> 6289.84
worked with metals and melting them

6274.639 --> 6289.84
it takes quite a lot of heat to do it

6295.84 --> 6299.4400000000005
yeah or another space doesn't exist it's

6298.96 --> 6301.76
fake

6299.44 --> 6303.599999999999
it's a medium a conceptual medium that

6301.76 --> 6305.76
doesn't exist

6303.6 --> 6306.88
okay i can't have gas pressure next to a

6305.76 --> 6310.56
vacuum i'm sorry

6306.88 --> 6315.679
i'm not going to answer your questions

6310.56 --> 6320.56
because there's no point right i'm not

6315.679 --> 6322.8
i'm not writing a a script for a movie

6320.56 --> 6324.639
and then like yeah you could ask me like

6322.8 --> 6326.56
oh i'm making a movie

6324.639 --> 6329.679
what what would it be like right but

6326.56 --> 6332.88
there's there's plenty of other people

6329.679 --> 6332.88
