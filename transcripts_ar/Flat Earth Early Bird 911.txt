110.64 --> 115.74
total summer now

112.799 --> 119.18
it's so hot I actually considered like

115.74 --> 119.17999999999999
not wearing a shirt today

126.719 --> 129.439
yeah

129.479 --> 133.56
it's just so clear

131.879 --> 137.42
and blue

133.56 --> 137.42000000000002
it's even less moist in the air

138.06 --> 144.66
and the wind is warm

141.959 --> 148.58
Sun is hot

144.66 --> 148.57999999999998
and everything's just green

150.12 --> 154.22

166.68 --> 172.98000000000002
sorry again I'm so late I

170.58 --> 174.959
I guess I needed my rest I woke up like

172.98 --> 177.17999999999998
five minutes before the show should

174.959 --> 179.64000000000001
normally start so

177.18 --> 182.34
barely had time to get things together

179.64 --> 185.39999999999998
still got my breakfast to wear a coffee

182.34 --> 188.0
[Music]

185.4 --> 188.0
huh

191.239 --> 196.28
yes Roger MC I have plants

198.659 --> 203.659
hello ah

202.019 --> 207.37900000000002
so

203.659 --> 207.379
911 hey

215.58 --> 220.68
right

217.319 --> 225.599
I'll I'll yeah I'll do my best to try

220.68 --> 228.20000000000002
and get to bed earlier this today

225.599 --> 228.2
oh

228.54 --> 233.12
hello Shatner's bassoon good to see you

235.14 --> 241.39999999999998
right so I'm kind of still in the

237.9 --> 241.4
process of waking up a little

243.18 --> 245.9
uh

273.36 --> 278.699
right

275.58 --> 281.12
so anyway yeah yesterday was a pretty

278.699 --> 281.12
cool day

282.919 --> 289.88
uh Flat Earth debates

286.68 --> 289.88
was decent

291.24 --> 296.759
so was my show

293.58 --> 299.69899999999996
I thought right it's something that was

296.759 --> 301.62
kind of interesting noteworthy is that

299.699 --> 306.06
didn't expect that oh I was kind of

301.62 --> 307.56
watching Infowars playing a game

306.06 --> 311.759
typical

307.56 --> 315.36
and then fox day came on Alex Jones like

311.759 --> 320.16
with Alex Jones himself even

315.36 --> 323.639
and apparently yeah he's also building

320.16 --> 325.62
Comics like pretty interesting superhero

323.639 --> 327.84000000000003
comics

325.62 --> 330.06
that he uses

327.84 --> 331.61999999999995
a lot of psychology and modern day

330.06 --> 332.88
events

331.62 --> 335.88
to

332.88 --> 338.34
project that onto the characters so I've

335.88 --> 341.94
heard I've never actually read them but

338.34 --> 344.69899999999996
from what I've seen it's pretty decent

341.94 --> 348.139
like I'm not personally much of a comic

344.699 --> 351.90000000000003
book fan like the the actual Comics

348.139 --> 354.74
format but I think that his are probably

351.9 --> 354.73999999999995
pretty okay

355.56 --> 361.639
all right but anyway yeah he came on

357.9 --> 361.63899999999995
Alex Jones so that was like what

362.46 --> 368.21999999999997
I think it's happened before

364.56 --> 370.8
that Alex was like really

368.22 --> 373.08000000000004
giving him recognition for his insight

370.8 --> 375.259
and all that so that was like what all

373.08 --> 375.25899999999996
right

380.699 --> 385.16
hey seeking star water good to see you

387.24 --> 393.84000000000003
hope I am well if not awake I'm doing

391.319 --> 395.28000000000003
okay my jaw it is kind of where I

393.84 --> 396.9
thought it was going to be it's still a

395.28 --> 400.81899999999996
little sore

396.9 --> 400.81899999999996
but I can even

401.699 --> 405.72
I can even bite down

403.62 --> 408.979
it's still a little sore though but it's

405.72 --> 408.97900000000004
like the worst is over

410.28 --> 413.539
I may have

414.259 --> 420.47900000000004
overplayed it I thought that it was not

418.199 --> 424.5
that that was basically going to be

420.479 --> 427.139
completely out of out of my attention

424.5 --> 429.0
but yeah it is still a little sore so

427.139 --> 432.919
I'm kind of annoyed by it

429.0 --> 432.919
but overall I'm doing okay

435.06 --> 440.78000000000003
I'm not super awake right now but I'll

438.3 --> 440.78000000000003
get there

445.259 --> 449.0
it's just so warm out here

455.4 --> 460.5
hey I'm pretty surprised I even managed

458.46 --> 462.84
to kind of sleep through all that heat

460.5 --> 465.38
in the last few hours

462.84 --> 465.38
huh

475.139 --> 479.96000000000004
all right so what else went down

477.599 --> 479.96
yesterday

486.96 --> 491.58
all right premiers

489.419 --> 493.37899999999996
pretty much it

491.58 --> 496.31899999999996
a numpty clip

493.379 --> 498.59900000000005
from QE

496.319 --> 501.12
yeah

498.599 --> 504.199
so that was pretty much it

501.12 --> 504.199
wake and bake

524.159 --> 528.74
the decadence of a European summer

527.0 --> 531.54
decadence

528.74 --> 534.2
how so

531.54 --> 534.1999999999999
ah

546.42 --> 552.4799999999999
right there was also

549.12 --> 553.8
at the uh American Journal the the

552.48 --> 555.899
pre-show

553.8 --> 559.5799999999999
to Alex Jones Show

555.899 --> 562.44
it was a big item about

559.58 --> 565.14
Chemtrails again

562.44 --> 568.44
and it was interesting

565.14 --> 569.9399999999999
it's good that they still put that info

568.44 --> 572.7
out

569.94 --> 574.6800000000001
because I do think that yeah like people

572.7 --> 576.24
like Rasta had his own have also been on

574.68 --> 579.12
to it it's like there seems to be a lot

576.24 --> 582.24
of weather modification activities going

579.12 --> 584.279
on in the United States

582.24 --> 587.519
right so whatever you're gonna think the

584.279 --> 591.12
trails are when there just seems to be a

587.519 --> 593.1
natural weather patterns and events

591.12 --> 595.68
that's yeah

593.1 --> 597.4200000000001
how it's concluded that there are just

595.68 --> 599.459
weather modifications happening with

597.42 --> 602.16
like weather front

599.459 --> 603.8389999999999
interferences

602.16 --> 605.519
so yeah

603.839 --> 609.0600000000001
and that's happening in the United

605.519 --> 611.839
States pretty sure it is

609.06 --> 611.8389999999999
uh

613.8 --> 619.079
and maybe yeah I would suggested that it

616.5 --> 621.06
might also be happening around the area

619.079 --> 623.88
of Syria

621.06 --> 624.959
and Iran so

623.88 --> 629.6
right

624.959 --> 629.5999999999999
anyway I remember watching that

634.38 --> 641.0
all right rocket blimps yeah I guess

636.779 --> 641.0
that compared to Australian Summers

641.16 --> 645.48
Europe is pretty nice

643.5 --> 649.16
because I think that in Australia it can

645.48 --> 649.16
get really hot during the summer

662.94 --> 667.2790000000001
you've become a wise promoter

669.72 --> 672.6800000000001
what's that

673.5 --> 676.57
[Music]

689.82 --> 695.88
whoa

691.92 --> 699.019
dude seeking Star Wars that link is like

695.88 --> 699.019
freaking five hours

700.079 --> 703.2199999999999
holy [ __ ]

711.06 --> 717.1999999999999
now who's voicing that video by the way

713.339 --> 717.2
I'm not uh unmuting it

735.839 --> 741.899
all right five hours

738.72 --> 743.639
is that all is it all from David Wise is

741.899 --> 746.899
he voicing it all

743.639 --> 746.899
man five hours

751.68 --> 755.5999999999999
some good looking pictures in there

770.7 --> 773.5400000000001
oh God

773.88 --> 776.88
uh

782.04 --> 787.74
not sure if it's all him so you haven't

784.26 --> 790.3389999999999
watched the entire thing then

787.74 --> 790.339
all right

793.56 --> 799.1999999999999
it is a five hour video but yeah maybe

796.74 --> 801.24
I'll check it out

799.2 --> 804.12
if it's really nice I might actually

801.24 --> 807.62
just start listening it

804.12 --> 807.62
in the background or something

810.24 --> 813.44
somewhere later today

823.74 --> 830.4590000000001
in seven parts

826.5 --> 833.04
so you mean that the five hour video is

830.459 --> 834.1199999999999
seven Parts fused together or does that

833.04 --> 838.16
mean

834.12 --> 841.139
this is one five hour part of seven

838.16 --> 844.1
is it a 35 hour

841.139 --> 844.1
long show

878.1 --> 884.0600000000001
right so it is the fusion of all the

880.98 --> 884.0600000000001
seven parts right right

885.24 --> 890.88
yeah it does say one

887.399 --> 892.86
four one two seven right so it is all of

890.88 --> 895.4399999999999
it okay okay okay

892.86 --> 898.44
sorry if I'm a little slow

895.44 --> 898.44
is

901.8 --> 904.76
ah

904.94 --> 910.94
42.8 minutes each all right

907.98 --> 910.94
hello GM West

931.8 --> 933.9799999999999
foreign

943.139 --> 948.3
okay uh also I wanted to address

946.32 --> 950.6990000000001
something since I had a little Fallout

948.3 --> 952.4399999999999
with rest I had yesterday I haven't

950.699 --> 955.8599999999999
really talked

952.44 --> 958.259
back got back to him about it yesterday

955.86 --> 960.12
but he was he seemed to be kind of

958.259 --> 962.94
irritated

960.12 --> 965.4590000000001
with the stance that I was taking as a

962.94 --> 968.0600000000001
as ball win

965.459 --> 968.06
right

969.66 --> 976.86
but I did look into it and it

973.8 --> 978.899
yeah I I think I even said it back then

976.86 --> 980.94
like

978.899 --> 983.519
it's inconclusive

980.94 --> 985.0790000000001
the way that I'm up like it isn't really

983.519 --> 987.6
that broken

985.079 --> 989.6389999999999
and I just think that I think that Rasta

987.6 --> 992.1800000000001
hat kind of doesn't really like it when

989.639 --> 992.1800000000001
I do that

996.36 --> 1001.519
I don't know what overall you guys think

999.06 --> 1003.079
about it I've had actually a couple of

1001.519 --> 1008.019
compliments

1003.079 --> 1008.019
especially from the FED panel

1008.18 --> 1014.12
over it

1010.579 --> 1017.0
what was rasta's deal yesterday

1014.12 --> 1019.24
well he just thought that I was trying

1017.0 --> 1019.24
to

1020.66 --> 1024.439
yeah

1022.16 --> 1026.839
he he really doesn't like Ballers

1024.439 --> 1028.699
because of the spirit of them his

1026.839 --> 1030.4389999999999
information getting things wrong trying

1028.699 --> 1033.559
to spread wrong information and he

1030.439 --> 1035.48
thought that I was doing that and yeah I

1033.559 --> 1038.059
was kind of borderlining it right so

1035.48 --> 1041.839
when rust had gets like that he usually

1038.059 --> 1044.9189999999999
does have a good reason it's just that

1041.839 --> 1044.9189999999999
is timing

1045.14 --> 1049.8200000000002
right

1047.419 --> 1053.6000000000001
so to me it kind of felt

1049.82 --> 1056.96
like Bowen is kind of like a

1053.6 --> 1059.539
and magicians act in a way what all

1056.96 --> 1062.299
Ballers are but it's always bowing and

1059.539 --> 1064.7
it just felt like he was getting in

1062.299 --> 1065.66
there and just ruining the magician's

1064.7 --> 1068.26
trick

1065.66 --> 1068.26
for me

1068.84 --> 1072.5
like but it's fake it's fake but it's

1071.36 --> 1075.52
wrong

1072.5 --> 1079.1
it's like yeah hello

1075.52 --> 1081.2
I'm trying to uphold an act here

1079.1 --> 1084.26
with Baldwin that is

1081.2 --> 1087.14
right I'm honest about that

1084.26 --> 1089.36
but it is a development process

1087.14 --> 1093.74
how he reasons things out

1089.36 --> 1096.86
and it's not perfect and it's almost

1093.74 --> 1098.48
with Glee

1096.86 --> 1102.02
like I know

1098.48 --> 1104.299
he is still in a baller position he will

1102.02 --> 1107.0
give more recognition to Flat Earth

1104.299 --> 1110.4189999999999
arguments than any baller would ever do

1107.0 --> 1111.64
right because he is kind of like a

1110.419 --> 1114.679
mutant

1111.64 --> 1115.8200000000002
it's a baller and a flat earther at the

1114.679 --> 1119.0590000000002
same time

1115.82 --> 1120.9189999999999
it's weird I know it is it's kind of

1119.059 --> 1123.799
weird even being like that but it works

1120.919 --> 1124.88
it used to work it weirded everybody out

1123.799 --> 1126.98
then

1124.88 --> 1131.14
and it's probably gonna wear out a

1126.98 --> 1131.14
couple of people right now just

1134.24 --> 1142.96
right but the whole fun of being Baldwin

1137.12 --> 1142.9599999999998
is is that you're not discouraged by

1143.66 --> 1149.059
having original

1145.84 --> 1151.4599999999998
constructions ideas of how to establish

1149.059 --> 1154.76
Earth being a ball of having them

1151.46 --> 1157.76
completely unrouted and broken

1154.76 --> 1160.58
because Baldwin is like an eternal

1157.76 --> 1164.6
optimist and he can always find some

1160.58 --> 1164.6
kind of a way through right

1166.22 --> 1170.0
it's like

1167.419 --> 1172.7
no no we don't need

1170.0 --> 1176.059
measuring things and seeing things to

1172.7 --> 1178.3400000000001
determine irresistible like how can then

1176.059 --> 1181.0
I'm focusing on how can I kind of

1178.34 --> 1181.0
justify

1182.36 --> 1187.34
not just straight out denying scientific

1185.84 --> 1190.4599999999998
method

1187.34 --> 1191.9599999999998
or Optics what is established in Optics

1190.46 --> 1195.039
but actually

1191.96 --> 1195.039
sidestep it

1195.38 --> 1199.8200000000002
in a way that at first may seem

1197.78 --> 1202.76
incredibly unreasonable but in the face

1199.82 --> 1206.74
of what Bowlers do it may not turn out

1202.76 --> 1206.74
to be that unreasonable after all

1209.419 --> 1215.0590000000002
right in a way I'm predicting also where

1212.539 --> 1217.34
the Ballers will go

1215.059 --> 1218.48
problem is though they'll have to get

1217.34 --> 1221.4189999999999
over

1218.48 --> 1223.64
that they can absolutely be wrong for

1221.419 --> 1228.8200000000002
for long times and that they may have

1223.64 --> 1228.8200000000002
been handed over simplified machinations

1229.52 --> 1235.6399999999999
that prioritized indoctrination over

1232.82 --> 1238.22
actual spreading of understanding right

1235.64 --> 1240.74
they have to

1238.22 --> 1242.6000000000001
let that sink in and I think that for a

1240.74 --> 1244.4
lot of the trenches especially that's

1242.6 --> 1246.26
just impossible like they can never

1244.4 --> 1249.679
admit that

1246.26 --> 1253.1
and that's where Bowen is different

1249.679 --> 1254.72
he is different than them

1253.1 --> 1257.62
I'm a wizard

1254.72 --> 1257.6200000000001
it's a wizard

1258.86 --> 1262.24
give fair warning

1267.32 --> 1273.32
right my Wizardry is not meant to bind

1270.679 --> 1275.299
people into Insanity it's for

1273.32 --> 1278.2
entertainment and learning purposes and

1275.299 --> 1278.2
that's why I

1278.36 --> 1281.9799999999998
give a fair warning

1289.1 --> 1294.74
everyone knew you were wrong

1291.74 --> 1296.419
well that was well he may have been

1294.74 --> 1299.659
correct in

1296.419 --> 1303.1000000000001
uh with the the Flat Earth debate crew

1299.659 --> 1303.1000000000001
wasn't having me at all

1303.14 --> 1308.24
like they were not playing along but I

1306.26 --> 1310.039
even felt a bit disrespected for it

1308.24 --> 1314.299
because I didn't really get enough room

1310.039 --> 1316.7
to give my nitpicky argument

1314.299 --> 1318.74
right and hey when that's the only thing

1316.7 --> 1321.679
you have left from a baller perspective

1318.74 --> 1326.24
in an argument it is really kind of

1321.679 --> 1327.5
unfair to not even let them do that

1326.24 --> 1328.7
right

1327.5 --> 1331.159
again

1328.7 --> 1333.44
flat earthers

1331.159 --> 1335.1200000000001
maybe getting a little overconfident

1333.44 --> 1337.64
about their

1335.12 --> 1339.02
intellectual winning positions in the

1337.64 --> 1342.6200000000001
arguments

1339.02 --> 1345.7
and thereby letting

1342.62 --> 1345.6999999999998
letting down

1349.1 --> 1358.4189999999999
certain levels of courtesy right

1353.84 --> 1358.4189999999999
that's that was kind of the point

1358.88 --> 1363.919
right because of course what Baldwin has

1361.22 --> 1366.38
to say on the long run is literally a

1363.919 --> 1368.7800000000002
joke for the flat earthers it is just

1366.38 --> 1371.6000000000001
just like the bowlers are in a way like

1368.78 --> 1375.74
the ones that double down rumpus and

1371.6 --> 1378.1399999999999
kosho and all of weirdos right

1375.74 --> 1379.76
on the long run you know it doesn't hold

1378.14 --> 1382.1000000000001
true

1379.76 --> 1383.179
it's only two Gaslight themselves in

1382.1 --> 1385.039
that moment

1383.179 --> 1388.419
but that doesn't mean that you can't

1385.039 --> 1388.419
have courtesy right

1388.82 --> 1395.32
if you're already winning then you

1390.919 --> 1395.3200000000002
should be gracious about it right

1398.84 --> 1404.1789999999999
so there is some room for improvement

1401.9 --> 1407.24
there and I know it's very difficult

1404.179 --> 1409.299
when a lot of the opponents spends a lot

1407.24 --> 1412.76
of time to literally just trying to

1409.299 --> 1415.1589999999999
psychologically dominate

1412.76 --> 1419.24
then you get less tolerant

1415.159 --> 1423.5800000000002
what if somebody doesn't do that

1419.24 --> 1423.58
then you shouldn't engage on that level

1423.98 --> 1427.6
hello Jim West

1428.059 --> 1432.94
and here we go again level Earth

1430.34 --> 1432.9399999999998
Observer

1434.96 --> 1438.52
Tarot 306.

1444.44 --> 1449.179
it's clear to say that ball wins

1446.48 --> 1450.799
approach made Wiggles pipe up

1449.179 --> 1454.64
Maybe

1450.799 --> 1457.6
I think I do give them courage

1454.64 --> 1460.279
because I am effectively

1457.6 --> 1463.279
using the same process as they

1460.279 --> 1466.539
religiously use and then show them like

1463.279 --> 1466.539
there's always more

1466.94 --> 1471.2
right

1468.26 --> 1473.44
while they from a True Believer

1471.2 --> 1476.24
perspective are probably very

1473.44 --> 1479.38
demoralized overall because it seems

1476.24 --> 1479.38
like there's so little room

1481.52 --> 1485.96
because they have to believe they can

1483.62 --> 1488.6
make mistakes foreign

1485.96 --> 1491.679
it can never be wrong with the tools

1488.6 --> 1491.6789999999999
that were handed to them

1495.62 --> 1501.9189999999999
so yeah maybe he did get on

1498.799 --> 1505.1589999999999
because of what I did

1501.919 --> 1507.14
but you only really know when when the

1505.159 --> 1512.2600000000002
Ballers themselves like wiggles or

1507.14 --> 1512.26
whoever start to use the same arguments

1513.74 --> 1516.7
then you'll know

1528.34 --> 1531.58
mundane it

1534.14 --> 1540.0800000000002
well no it's different Eric

1537.98 --> 1542.539
you see

1540.08 --> 1546.6399999999999
it's not their intellect really that's

1542.539 --> 1549.799
the problem it's their energy Dynamics

1546.64 --> 1553.46
and their position and the vulnerability

1549.799 --> 1555.5
it brings with actual

1553.46 --> 1559.7
social interactions

1555.5 --> 1562.58
right so they are weakened

1559.7 --> 1564.559
by their position and their actions and

1562.58 --> 1566.6589999999999
therefore they can't really use their

1564.559 --> 1569.6589999999999
intellect

1566.659 --> 1571.88
as much as they would like to

1569.659 --> 1575.0
and as much as we are used to because

1571.88 --> 1578.0590000000002
that can be bound

1575.0 --> 1581.36
by just their overall composure and

1578.059 --> 1583.76
their actions and it is so yeah then

1581.36 --> 1588.559
they really do

1583.76 --> 1590.84
display mundane intellect because of it

1588.559 --> 1593.32
if they would be more free

1590.84 --> 1595.58
to use their intellect date probably

1593.32 --> 1597.32
surprise you here and there but yeah

1595.58 --> 1599.72
that's like

1597.32 --> 1601.9399999999998
can you imagine that'll ever happen to

1599.72 --> 1604.279
these people like some

1601.94 --> 1606.74
Ballers might turn to Flat Earth it's

1604.279 --> 1608.659
happened before but some of these

1606.74 --> 1610.58
hardcore trenches like they'll never

1608.659 --> 1614.3600000000001
turn so it's like

1610.58 --> 1616.1589999999999
a afterlife Heaven situation like when

1614.36 --> 1619.1589999999999
they're freeze

1616.159 --> 1622.88
from their baller curse then they'd be

1619.159 --> 1626.48
like whoa dudes what did I miss

1622.88 --> 1628.3400000000001
in the afterlife whatever right

1626.48 --> 1630.799
because I can't imagine they'll ever do

1628.34 --> 1633.1999999999998
that in life these people are gonna get

1630.799 --> 1635.9189999999999
old and die they're gonna turn into Sean

1633.2 --> 1635.919
hawkins's

1637.58 --> 1640.24
uh

1651.32 --> 1657.52
maybe he was coming to defend you

1654.799 --> 1657.52
really

1660.5 --> 1663.159
huh

1667.039 --> 1672.559
well then I was kind of like a trap if

1670.22 --> 1674.3600000000001
that if you see it like that if he

1672.559 --> 1678.6789999999999
really felt compelled to come and defend

1674.36 --> 1682.279
me because I don't really need defending

1678.679 --> 1684.74
and like the guys at the flag like they

1682.279 --> 1687.159
really treat me

1684.74 --> 1689.8990000000001
very well

1687.159 --> 1693.5
considering like how as in the Baldwin

1689.899 --> 1696.3799999999999
act how much I am like a baller they

1693.5 --> 1700.7
treat me very nice

1696.38 --> 1703.5800000000002
like I I do realize that like they could

1700.7 --> 1705.919
just full on approach me like a baller

1703.58 --> 1708.08
and then I probably wouldn't get a word

1705.919 --> 1709.5200000000002
in between I I would become a stuttering

1708.08 --> 1711.32
rhombus then

1709.52 --> 1713.6
right

1711.32 --> 1716.0
but if somebody is going to come in to

1713.6 --> 1718.039
defend me over some minor things from

1716.0 --> 1721.279
the ball side yeah of course Nathan's

1718.039 --> 1723.02
immediately like oh there's the real

1721.279 --> 1726.02
thing let's

1723.02 --> 1728.32
like let's get him so that's gonna

1726.02 --> 1728.32
happen

1732.32 --> 1737.96
oh

1733.46 --> 1737.96
all right Amanda young congratulations

1751.96 --> 1755.6200000000001
hello ajm

1770.419 --> 1776.0
to make it sound like you only ever meet

1773.899 --> 1779.059
people who are flat earthers while tiny

1776.0 --> 1784.059
Womble is not entirely true most people

1779.059 --> 1784.059
that I meet are normies

1785.24 --> 1790.7
and if they're into conspiracy theory a

1788.779 --> 1793.779
lot of them are kind of already

1790.7 --> 1796.76
subjected to Savanna syndrome

1793.779 --> 1797.899
it's very prevalent in the Netherlands

1796.76 --> 1799.76
unfortunately

1797.899 --> 1802.4599999999998
it's like one of the first things that

1799.76 --> 1803.84
happens in a lot of Dutch people stick

1802.46 --> 1806.98
to it

1803.84 --> 1806.98
it's problematic

1812.84 --> 1817.1
but

1813.98 --> 1820.039
people do get Beyond it and then they

1817.1 --> 1822.32
really kind of turn secretive

1820.039 --> 1824.6589999999999
so they know these things they just

1822.32 --> 1825.799
don't they try to hide it because they

1824.659 --> 1829.0
know

1825.799 --> 1829.0
is dangerous

1829.279 --> 1836.0
to share all that stuff with just random

1831.86 --> 1839.6789999999999
people because they might go nuts on you

1836.0 --> 1842.059
right I I take relatively high risk by

1839.679 --> 1844.159
still doing that even though I do it

1842.059 --> 1846.08
carefully but most people in the

1844.159 --> 1849.94
Netherlands are just normies

1846.08 --> 1849.9399999999998
and they don't really care

1852.38 --> 1859.72
like they're not naturally drawn

1855.5 --> 1859.72
to the subject of Earth shape

1866.419 --> 1871.6000000000001
and in a way kind of I like to keep it

1869.179 --> 1871.6000000000001
like that

1875.48 --> 1881.96
I don't really have a proper plan to be

1878.6 --> 1885.86
honest in how to

1881.96 --> 1888.74
uphold my flat earthing

1885.86 --> 1890.7199999999998
like out there I don't really have a

1888.74 --> 1894.14
plan for it so I've kept it secret

1890.72 --> 1897.039
mostly and that's perfectly fine

1894.14 --> 1897.039
for me

1897.62 --> 1901.76
I've never really figured out like how

1900.08 --> 1904.6399999999999
can I

1901.76 --> 1908.6589999999999
start like really publicly coming out

1904.64 --> 1911.96
and talking about it more in a way

1908.659 --> 1914.3600000000001
that would be sustainable for me

1911.96 --> 1917.48
right because if I literally get people

1914.36 --> 1919.82
that are gonna physically act out just

1917.48 --> 1923.96
like the trolls and [ __ ]

1919.82 --> 1926.84
that kind of like no oh this guy talks

1923.96 --> 1928.58
about Flat Earth just out there not on

1926.84 --> 1932.299
the internet somewhere

1928.58 --> 1935.539
then they might get in my face and that

1932.299 --> 1938.5
that would really

1935.539 --> 1938.5
ruin my day

1938.539 --> 1943.76
I just don't respond well to that kind

1940.76 --> 1947.98
of conflict like I can't probably handle

1943.76 --> 1947.98
it but it'll totally ruin my mood

1948.38 --> 1953.6000000000001
and I use

1950.899 --> 1957.1589999999999
a lot of I tap a lot of strength out of

1953.6 --> 1957.1589999999999
keeping my mood stable

1958.039 --> 1960.76
so

1962.24 --> 1967.76
right and hey on the internet you can

1964.519 --> 1970.3990000000001
literally click turn it off bend your

1967.76 --> 1972.919
mind quickly to something else and then

1970.399 --> 1973.6399999999999
whatever bad moods was gonna rub off on

1972.919 --> 1976.519
you

1973.64 --> 1979.039
will actually go away

1976.519 --> 1981.559
or I can resolve it on the spot and then

1979.039 --> 1983.24
forget about it right but out there

1981.559 --> 1985.399
you can't do that

1983.24 --> 1988.179
because if you're literally just quickly

1985.399 --> 1988.1789999999999
gonna walk away

1988.399 --> 1993.86
like yeah it's different

1991.94 --> 1995.6000000000001
in the internet you can just click turn

1993.86 --> 1998.6
it off

1995.6 --> 2000.58
and that not let it rub off on you

1998.6 --> 2002.9189999999999
uh

2000.58 --> 2005.9399999999998
you you were referring to Tara's comment

2002.919 --> 2005.94
oh okay

2007.96 --> 2012.779
oh I guess I was just inspired

2014.32 --> 2017.799
by this idea I have the thought about it

2016.84 --> 2021.779
right

2017.799 --> 2021.779
it's like how do I even like

2029.14 --> 2033.0
like what do people do

2033.34 --> 2037.4189999999999
that's not gonna make them bored out of

2035.5 --> 2040.659
their minds

2037.419 --> 2043.1200000000001
like what do people do out there in

2040.659 --> 2045.7600000000002
their social activities

2043.12 --> 2048.8399999999997
that wouldn't bore me out of my mind

2045.76 --> 2048.84
every single time

2055.599 --> 2060.96
I am on any shows later on

2062.619 --> 2067.26
yes Jim West where I'm gonna join the

2064.78 --> 2071.0400000000004
Flat Earth debates

2067.26 --> 2071.0400000000004
in an hour

2089.5 --> 2094.079
does a literal mean without exaggeration

2099.52 --> 2105.94
well lateral opposes metaphorical

2103.9 --> 2108.04
right when you when something's

2105.94 --> 2111.28
metaphorical you're trying to highlight

2108.04 --> 2113.14
this Spirit of a situation or a situ

2111.28 --> 2117.0400000000004
yeah

2113.14 --> 2120.64
and it's literal that means no it's it's

2117.04 --> 2123.52
not a symbol it's literally that right

2120.64 --> 2126.1189999999997
that's what the word literal really

2123.52 --> 2126.119
stands for

2128.859 --> 2135.839
now of course it comes from literal as

2131.92 --> 2135.839
in written down

2136.3 --> 2141.82
like not described but written down in

2140.26 --> 2144.0400000000004
stone right there's the saying it's

2141.82 --> 2147.099
written in stone like it's absolutely

2144.04 --> 2150.42
like that that's where the word literal

2147.099 --> 2150.42
the spirit of it

2154.119 --> 2158.4
right and without exaggeration well

2161.26 --> 2166.599
that depends on how it would be

2163.06 --> 2167.44
exaggerated right if if you put more

2166.599 --> 2170.02
stuff

2167.44 --> 2172.18
on a description

2170.02 --> 2174.4
that actually happened you could call

2172.18 --> 2176.68
that an exaggeration

2174.4 --> 2178.96
then yeah it's not literal you're

2176.68 --> 2182.16
blowing it out of proportion

2178.96 --> 2182.16
you're making up [ __ ]

2183.099 --> 2190.2400000000002
does it make it better or worse uh both

2187.9 --> 2193.599
there's because there's a reason to

2190.24 --> 2196.839
exaggerate and that is to draw in to

2193.599 --> 2199.7200000000003
bind more attention well using fear

2196.839 --> 2201.9
often and that's not a good tactic by

2199.72 --> 2201.8999999999996
the way

2203.56 --> 2208.119
so that's the advantage disadvantage is

2206.619 --> 2210.52
that

2208.119 --> 2212.7400000000002
if you don't like that

2210.52 --> 2215.8
if you don't like that fear then you're

2212.74 --> 2218.16
going to literally ignore all of it

2215.8 --> 2218.1600000000003
right

2221.68 --> 2228.16
so it draws in more attention but it

2224.619 --> 2230.44
also deflects more attention so if you

2228.16 --> 2233.98
just don't exaggerate don't fear porn

2230.44 --> 2236.14
anything about it it'll give people the

2233.98 --> 2238.48
full room to soak it up

2236.14 --> 2239.859
right if it's not overly opinionated

2238.48 --> 2242.32
like that

2239.859 --> 2244.96
given a Direction

2242.32 --> 2246.7000000000003
by the exaggeration given the direction

2244.96 --> 2248.619
of oh this is where it's going this is

2246.7 --> 2250.14
how it feels this is good the

2248.619 --> 2254.619
consequence

2250.14 --> 2256.96
inevitable right something like that

2254.619 --> 2259.56
so very meta now by the way

2256.96 --> 2259.56
huh

2260.619 --> 2266.44
just like CV isn't exaggerates

2263.859 --> 2269.7999999999997
yeah but it's it's

2266.44 --> 2272.5
but that's just Overkill because it's

2269.8 --> 2275.82
literally nothing it's literally not the

2272.5 --> 2275.82
whole thing is a pure

2276.88 --> 2283.2400000000002
maybe like the mo the purest

2280.06 --> 2285.16
in over a century purest psychological

2283.24 --> 2288.4599999999996
operation

2285.16 --> 2291.5789999999997
so vast it's crazy how widespread it's

2288.46 --> 2295.0
become it's pure psychological there is

2291.579 --> 2297.94
no freaking virus at all

2295.0 --> 2300.4
like and worse than that because it even

2297.94 --> 2301.599
unfails like there's literally no

2300.4 --> 2304.1800000000003
viruses

2301.599 --> 2306.7000000000003
at all even though yeah in the medical

2304.18 --> 2309.3999999999996
system there are designations

2306.7 --> 2312.0989999999997
that are called virus virus this virus

2309.4 --> 2316.119
death is it a virus though

2312.099 --> 2318.88
has that been isolated like oh

2316.119 --> 2320.2000000000003
there is this very specific little viral

2318.88 --> 2322.599
particle

2320.2 --> 2324.8199999999997
and if somebody

2322.599 --> 2327.04
if you like extract that from the rest

2324.82 --> 2329.98
of the toxic environment

2327.04 --> 2332.44
and just that Viral particle and if

2329.98 --> 2335.02
somebody then yeah gets that in their

2332.44 --> 2339.46
blood or whatever then they get that

2335.02 --> 2343.0
virus disease no no

2339.46 --> 2346.0
virus is more like a a catch-all

2343.0 --> 2348.88
grouping name for mysterious

2346.0 --> 2350.5
designations that aren't specifically

2348.88 --> 2352.96
bacterial

2350.5 --> 2356.46
right

2352.96 --> 2356.46
because bacteria are real

2358.66 --> 2365.14
no it's not a cell AGM virus particles

2362.44 --> 2366.339
are much smaller than the cell much

2365.14 --> 2368.3199999999997
smaller

2366.339 --> 2371.0789999999997
and they're inanimate

2368.32 --> 2371.98
they're like a couple of proteins or

2371.079 --> 2374.82
something

2371.98 --> 2374.82
that's it

2375.28 --> 2380.92
it's not a cell cell is a very fast

2378.119 --> 2383.2000000000003
complicated system

2380.92 --> 2387.04
compared to a virus

2383.2 --> 2389.3799999999997
cell has like a is like a a household

2387.04 --> 2391.839
full of activity

2389.38 --> 2394.42
in the the vast

2391.839 --> 2397.119
Metropolis

2394.42 --> 2399.96
World System of the entire body right

2397.119 --> 2404.92
but a virus is just a couple of proteins

2399.96 --> 2407.46
what they call a virus an exosome

2404.92 --> 2407.46
right

2408.52 --> 2416.02
but it is indeed like what they say

2411.819 --> 2418.0
about it is just they're overplaying the

2416.02 --> 2421.66
infection danger and they're literally

2418.0 --> 2425.92
playing on the Sci-Fi Fair porn

2421.66 --> 2427.72
imaginations stories that have yeah that

2425.92 --> 2430.9
people have been exposed to through

2427.72 --> 2433.54
media series like what sci-fi series

2430.9 --> 2436.6600000000003
doesn't have some freaky virus

2433.54 --> 2439.2599999999998
and you get it and then you die terribly

2436.66 --> 2439.2599999999998
right

2439.66 --> 2444.04
that's programming

2441.579 --> 2446.6800000000003
you get the programming through the

2444.04 --> 2448.96
Sci-Fi series because sci-fi especially

2446.68 --> 2452.16
if you don't know the Earth is flat then

2448.96 --> 2455.7
sci-fi really is like it's literally

2452.16 --> 2459.7
where you go to see the future

2455.7 --> 2460.8999999999996
sci-fi right you go there to see the

2459.7 --> 2463.0
future

2460.9 --> 2466.7400000000002
that's even like how Star Trek works

2463.0 --> 2466.74
it's it that's part of futurism

2466.9 --> 2474.2200000000003
so you contract like future outlooks

2472.18 --> 2477.8799999999997
through sci-fi that's where they put

2474.22 --> 2480.8799999999997
they use it as programming like that

2477.88 --> 2482.619
so they hand the the programming

2480.88 --> 2485.56
receptors

2482.619 --> 2488.2000000000003
who virus super dangerous they hand them

2485.56 --> 2490.7799999999997
over through the series you watch them

2488.2 --> 2492.339
you contract them you take you don't

2490.78 --> 2495.099
really think about them but you know

2492.339 --> 2497.52
about them then something happens in the

2495.099 --> 2500.8590000000004
real world that plays into that

2497.52 --> 2503.68
programming say oh there's a virus you

2500.859 --> 2506.14
have to mask up and get the vaccine yeah

2503.68 --> 2509.0789999999997
vaccines are always safe in Sci-Fi

2506.14 --> 2511.839
series always vaccines are always safe

2509.079 --> 2513.94
in sci-fi series right always

2511.839 --> 2517.2999999999997
so yeah

2513.94 --> 2519.7000000000003
been programmed and now they abuse that

2517.3 --> 2521.619
programming or they use it if it was

2519.7 --> 2524.319
always that plan and that would make it

2521.619 --> 2526.42
extremely nefarious

2524.319 --> 2528.46
but you don't even know if the people

2526.42 --> 2532.619
that made the original series and used

2528.46 --> 2532.619
it like that knew that

2533.02 --> 2535.8
I'm not sure

2541.9 --> 2544.44
hmm

2561.88 --> 2568.1800000000003
right but here we go again

2565.599 --> 2569.8
you've seen some Sci-Fi series and all

2568.18 --> 2571.1189999999997
you know what I'm talking about right

2569.8 --> 2572.92
now right

2571.119 --> 2576.1600000000003
they hand you

2572.92 --> 2579.7000000000003
the fear of viruses and the safety of

2576.16 --> 2580.48
vaccines through a lot of sci-fi out

2579.7 --> 2582.8799999999997
there

2580.48 --> 2585.7
it's a it's grown worse by the way more

2582.88 --> 2589.02
intense when even the older ones like

2585.7 --> 2589.02
Star Trek was full of that

2590.38 --> 2598.06
right they're hypo sprays

2593.92 --> 2601.96
it solved everything the anti-radiation

2598.06 --> 2606.099
and oh some bacterial infection or

2601.96 --> 2608.68
whatever stable like always

2606.099 --> 2612.96
Star Trek's been a very predominant

2608.68 --> 2612.96
influence for that level of programming

2613.839 --> 2617.4
but other series too

2628.119 --> 2633.7000000000003
like Babylon 5 had it too or rather I

2631.839 --> 2635.74
don't remember if there was little now

2633.7 --> 2638.14
there were a couple of like a virus

2635.74 --> 2641.2599999999998
destroying an entire planet and all that

2638.14 --> 2644.14
the specific population was all

2641.26 --> 2645.3390000000004
destroyed because of a virus in Babylon

2644.14 --> 2647.859
5 even

2645.339 --> 2648.94
right but it was specific to their

2647.859 --> 2651.9
genetic

2648.94 --> 2651.9
hmm

2659.619 --> 2662.76
you remember that

2680.02 --> 2684.0
that's okay AGM

2684.48 --> 2690.88
that's almost right

2688.0 --> 2693.599
that in fact viruses don't really infect

2690.88 --> 2693.599
your cells

2693.819 --> 2701.56
like viruses are have a function in the

2697.54 --> 2704.319
body they clean up [ __ ] and when

2701.56 --> 2708.4
there's a lot of [ __ ] around

2704.319 --> 2711.339
then it's just automatic the the cells

2708.4 --> 2714.099
they realize like we can't handle this

2711.339 --> 2717.22
toxic environment so they're gonna let

2714.099 --> 2721.839
down their specific guard mechanically

2717.22 --> 2722.7999999999997
like clockwork to let the the exosomes

2721.839 --> 2725.68
in

2722.8 --> 2729.3390000000004
so they can reproduce themselves to

2725.68 --> 2732.8799999999997
produce more exosomes to clean up the

2729.339 --> 2734.619
garbage that made the cell let down its

2732.88 --> 2736.9
guard

2734.619 --> 2739.96
in order to do that right it fully

2736.9 --> 2742.359
lockstep mechanism it's it's inert it's

2739.96 --> 2745.359
in the body it's a body inherent

2742.359 --> 2750.2799999999997
mechanism it's part of the body it is

2745.359 --> 2753.2799999999997
not a like a bacteria from the outside

2750.28 --> 2757.5
and yeah even we have literal bacteria

2753.28 --> 2757.5
in our body especially like in our guts

2757.54 --> 2763.14
they are part of the body even though

2759.4 --> 2763.14
they are separate organisms

2763.42 --> 2766.96
symbiotic

2766.24 --> 2770.1389999999997
right

2766.96 --> 2770.139
[Music]

2781.96 --> 2786.3
okay where are the blues

2802.3 --> 2807.6400000000003
like a Lamborghini

2805.24 --> 2810.22
well people with Lamborghinis tend to

2807.64 --> 2812.5
get a little nutty

2810.22 --> 2814.74
a lot of them get into accidents

2812.5 --> 2814.74
actually

2815.079 --> 2824.099
because the throttle is like too much

2819.72 --> 2824.0989999999997
I get your point though ajm

2830.319 --> 2837.46
right so but but you are correct in

2833.8 --> 2840.28
and well at that part that yeah if you

2837.46 --> 2842.8
are not toxified

2840.28 --> 2845.8590000000004
then your cells will simply be like yeah

2842.8 --> 2852.2200000000003
we're doing fine and the exosomes which

2845.859 --> 2855.46
are always at all time your entire life

2852.22 --> 2858.04
present floating around

2855.46 --> 2860.079
they will just not activate they will

2858.04 --> 2863.079
not start reproducing the cleanup [ __ ]

2860.079 --> 2864.6400000000003
because there is it's good enough it but

2863.079 --> 2866.319
they will be there

2864.64 --> 2868.7799999999997
they're always there

2866.319 --> 2870.88
it's like even if you looked into like

2868.78 --> 2874.059
PCR tests and all that

2870.88 --> 2876.94
it works with percentages

2874.059 --> 2879.76
percentages every time because there is

2876.94 --> 2883.059
always a percentage

2879.76 --> 2887.1600000000003
you see it's a condition it's a

2883.059 --> 2887.1600000000003
condition it's not an infection

2908.46 --> 2916.44
yeah that thanks for putting it like

2912.22 --> 2916.4399999999996
that ajm but yes

2918.16 --> 2922.7799999999997
well your intestines

2920.46 --> 2926.14
are show

2922.78 --> 2927.8190000000004
a lot of activity that goes on like if

2926.14 --> 2929.68
you are in

2927.819 --> 2932.2799999999997
uh

2929.68 --> 2932.2799999999997
okay

2933.76 --> 2939.28
if your body's repairing issues or

2937.0 --> 2941.74
fighting inflammation or cleaning it up

2939.28 --> 2945.52
yes your intestines

2941.74 --> 2947.9199999999996
will definitely reflect that

2945.52 --> 2949.78
right you can really tell where your

2947.92 --> 2953.7000000000003
body's at through

2949.78 --> 2953.7000000000003
for your poo as you say it

2954.4 --> 2958.839
it's on your fingernails right well if

2956.559 --> 2961.44
you have that then then it gets quite

2958.839 --> 2961.44
dramatic

2970.119 --> 2975.2200000000003
first thing a doctor will look at is

2972.64 --> 2978.9
your fingers yeah yeah I do

2975.22 --> 2978.8999999999996
somebody's Nails immediately

2980.14 --> 2984.16
but overall it's just like okay Nails

2982.66 --> 2987.04
skin

2984.16 --> 2989.0789999999997
composure

2987.04 --> 2990.7599999999998
like are they in the state where they're

2989.079 --> 2992.92
constantly suppressing things and

2990.76 --> 2995.6400000000003
they're trying to forget about it

2992.92 --> 2995.64
or

2995.74 --> 3001.52
or not

2997.48 --> 3001.52
something else bothering them right

3001.619 --> 3008.54
I I medically analyze a lot of people

3004.26 --> 3008.5400000000004
just figure out like where are they at

3014.94 --> 3023.119
right sometimes it can be nerves

3019.2 --> 3023.1189999999997
especially if you don't know them

3024.66 --> 3028.98
because being nervous also like does a

3027.48 --> 3031.8
lot

3028.98 --> 3034.26
I know it does with me I get a I get

3031.8 --> 3037.099
really sweaty sometimes from it

3034.26 --> 3037.099
kind of annoying

3041.22 --> 3044.8999999999996
yes AGM I know

3061.74 --> 3068.4599999999996
right but ajm look if if the white of

3065.579 --> 3071.94
your nails increases

3068.46 --> 3074.2200000000003
like then it's pretty bad I think I've

3071.94 --> 3076.68
been told it before like if they really

3074.22 --> 3079.5
grow then you got a problem

3076.68 --> 3081.859
I think it happens more to young people

3079.5 --> 3081.859
though

3087.359 --> 3090.14
I don't know

3096.96 --> 3101.96
it's a long time since I was last

3098.88 --> 3101.96
reminded about that

3105.48 --> 3110.979
yeah but

3107.88 --> 3110.9790000000003
[Music]

3114.599 --> 3121.619
right yeah maybe you can remind me too

3118.619 --> 3124.559
think it was correlating with with an

3121.619 --> 3127.4
organ or something is it your liver

3124.559 --> 3127.4
what was it again

3148.02 --> 3151.74
come on AGM don't leave us in suspense

3150.66 --> 3154.64
man

3151.74 --> 3154.64
I

3165.48 --> 3168.68
oh God

3169.13 --> 3172.2290000000003
[Music]

3250.22 --> 3255.66
okay yeah yeah

3253.079 --> 3258.2000000000003
my mic disconnected thanks for telling

3255.66 --> 3258.2
me in chat

3258.78 --> 3263.3
right but I'm still waiting for AGM

3264.24 --> 3270.839
to share with us what he

3268.2 --> 3273.48
thanks

3270.839 --> 3277.5589999999997
it tells

3273.48 --> 3280.5
from his sources because when I look up

3277.559 --> 3284.599
whites on nails it just says in the

3280.5 --> 3284.599
Google search look here we had leukemia

3320.88 --> 3324.7400000000002
less oxygen and blood

3338.76 --> 3341.42
hmm

3347.04 --> 3351.02
if more purple than white

3352.319 --> 3354.98
really

3360.66 --> 3366.1189999999997
okay well in that case I would have less

3363.18 --> 3370.94
oxygen in my blood than

3366.119 --> 3370.94
because I have very short white ridges

3399.599 --> 3405.92
blue veins are good I got plenty well

3402.42 --> 3407.819
yeah well my veins on my hands are

3405.92 --> 3409.799
pronounced

3407.819 --> 3412.319
so

3409.799 --> 3414.559
yeah my I think my circulation is just

3412.319 --> 3414.5589999999997
fine

3415.079 --> 3420.7400000000002
whether it's cold or heat ought it's

3418.2 --> 3420.74
just fine

3435.48 --> 3439.099
okay I'll type lunar

3452.46 --> 3455.119
oh

3457.68 --> 3464.1189999999997
okay that's when it's not white it's

3460.14 --> 3464.1189999999997
blue that's looks creepy

3468.74 --> 3472.64
systemic drug side effect

3474.359 --> 3478.0989999999997
or systematic disorder

3485.579 --> 3489.559
okay

3487.079 --> 3489.559
whatever

3497.52 --> 3504.359
you can buy a clip for your finger that

3501.42 --> 3505.7400000000002
measures blood oxygen level from the

3504.359 --> 3508.4
nails

3505.74 --> 3508.3999999999996
really

3509.46 --> 3512.2400000000002
huh

3522.84 --> 3525.9790000000003
[Music]

3536.099 --> 3540.2000000000003
okay George Sanford if you say so

3557.88 --> 3562.619
white nails like yeah if they're

3560.099 --> 3565.28
completely White

3562.619 --> 3565.28
hmm

3570.42 --> 3577.64
wire Blues drink milk

3574.2 --> 3577.64
is that really gonna help

3582.059 --> 3588.6600000000003
like maybe if you drink raw milk

3585.96 --> 3590.64
from what I've actually heard milk is

3588.66 --> 3592.92
not really all that great it can

3590.64 --> 3595.14
actually decalcify you

3592.92 --> 3598.4
if it's pasteurized because of the

3595.14 --> 3598.4
damaged protein

3598.5 --> 3604.92
that require your body actually to

3602.04 --> 3607.5589999999997
conjure up calcium in order to process

3604.92 --> 3609.119
it make it harmless

3607.559 --> 3611.88
so

3609.119 --> 3614.76
I don't know to what degree that is true

3611.88 --> 3617.7200000000003
but I have stopped drinking milk

3614.76 --> 3617.7200000000003
for a long time

3619.14 --> 3623.24
potassium magnesium hmm

3631.74 --> 3637.74
is not assimilated without magnesium huh

3635.94 --> 3641.96
that's interesting because I have been

3637.74 --> 3641.9599999999996
using some magnesium recently

3651.96 --> 3654.2
foreign

3664.099 --> 3669.42
well classical homeopath but if it's if

3667.319 --> 3671.099
it's not pasteurized if it's literally

3669.42 --> 3673.819
raw milk

3671.099 --> 3673.819
fresh

3673.859 --> 3681.5989999999997
and organic organically fed well treated

3677.7 --> 3686.72
animal like goat or cow

3681.599 --> 3686.7200000000003
then it it's not unhealthy

3700.74 --> 3707.0589999999997
right I as a kid I used to love milk

3703.98 --> 3712.22
like I drank a lot of milk

3707.059 --> 3712.2200000000003
and even as a baby I used to love

3712.44 --> 3717.839
mommy's milk a lot

3714.78 --> 3720.1800000000003
like she didn't she might she I remember

3717.839 --> 3723.42
she told me that she had to like fight

3720.18 --> 3726.6189999999997
me off at the end because I was like no

3723.42 --> 3726.619
it's mine

3727.079 --> 3732.119
like I guess my instinct just knew like

3729.66 --> 3734.8799999999997
that's the thing you need you need it

3732.119 --> 3739.52
right now or you'll be sorry later in

3734.88 --> 3739.52
life like I knew that as a baby just

3741.24 --> 3747.68
I was quite maniacal about it

3744.299 --> 3747.68
so she told me

3773.64 --> 3777.02
yeah I know Jim West

3783.9 --> 3786.9
foreign

3803.539 --> 3807.92
well seeking star water look

3808.92 --> 3811.52
foreign

3813.72 --> 3818.22
and how it's formed

3815.7 --> 3820.14
it's not like every time they say oh

3818.22 --> 3823.02
they're taking it away from the calves

3820.14 --> 3826.68
well not necessarily you can

3823.02 --> 3830.18
artificially keep the milk system going

3826.68 --> 3830.18
right and then

3830.76 --> 3840.6600000000003
for like the the little one the calf

3836.16 --> 3842.64
they really mostly need the first milk

3840.66 --> 3845.52
the first milk like when it really

3842.64 --> 3846.72
starts up because that has like all the

3845.52 --> 3852.72
maximum

3846.72 --> 3855.8999999999996
uh endurance lifters how you call it

3852.72 --> 3858.18
the immune system input that has it all

3855.9 --> 3860.28
right well that milk is typically not

3858.18 --> 3864.1189999999997
used for

3860.28 --> 3866.8190000000004
for sales right or what they do is

3864.119 --> 3869.28
when the calf has that milk at first

3866.819 --> 3870.839
they should get it if unless they're

3869.28 --> 3872.88
going to be slotted or something which

3870.839 --> 3874.92
would be tragic

3872.88 --> 3877.1400000000003
but then after that they just keep

3874.92 --> 3879.119
milking it even like after the calf

3877.14 --> 3881.0989999999997
doesn't really need it all that much

3879.119 --> 3884.059
anymore it just

3881.099 --> 3884.059
keep it going

3884.16 --> 3889.5789999999997
much longer

3886.98 --> 3889.579
so

3891.18 --> 3896.22
yeah and with goats I learned this from

3894.119 --> 3899.94
Owen Benjamin it's it's even weirder

3896.22 --> 3902.7599999999998
because yeah once you get them pregnant

3899.94 --> 3907.7000000000003
that you can literally keep them going

3902.76 --> 3907.7000000000003
with milk for incredible long periods

3978.9 --> 3982.859
don't like the the meat substitutes at

3982.079 --> 3985.26
all

3982.859 --> 3987.72
like if you don't want to eat that then

3985.26 --> 3989.7000000000003
don't try to use something else and

3987.72 --> 3991.6189999999997
pretend it is that

3989.7 --> 3995.5789999999997
which you're not supposed to be eating

3991.619 --> 3998.7000000000003
anymore that just seems ridiculous to me

3995.579 --> 4003.98
like either you eat meat or you don't

3998.7 --> 4007.9399999999996
either you use milk product or you don't

4003.98 --> 4011.14
right all this fakery I I don't get it I

4007.94 --> 4011.14
don't appreciate it too much

4017.42 --> 4019.9
what

4020.059 --> 4025.579
almond milk is great well look if you

4022.46 --> 4029.38
like that if you like almond milk okay

4025.579 --> 4029.38
but it's not really milk

4036.98 --> 4042.559
right nothing wrong with it if you like

4039.619 --> 4045.4
it but it's not milk

4042.559 --> 4048.3190000000004
it's not gonna work the same in recipes

4045.4 --> 4050.78
if you use it instead of milk it's

4048.319 --> 4052.52
something else

4050.78 --> 4055.76
you hurt not hurt oh I don't want to

4052.52 --> 4057.44
know Jim West I know it's like blood or

4055.76 --> 4060.579

black pudding

4063.799 --> 4068.14
blood gelatin or something yak

4084.98 --> 4088.539

4089.119 --> 4091.839
takes

4106.94 --> 4111.219
is it now YouTube really

4136.46 --> 4143.7390000000005
uh Pat fee I I almost want to ban you

4140.48 --> 4143.739
just for saying that

4144.52 --> 4151.299000000001
greenhouse gases emissions

4147.799 --> 4151.299
shut the [ __ ] up dude

4153.02 --> 4156.7390000000005
you that what what's your proof that

4155.359 --> 4159.56
that is bad

4156.739 --> 4161.659
right what is your proof that that is

4159.56 --> 4164.5
actually a good thing less greenhouse

4166.759 --> 4171.1

4168.44 --> 4171.099999999999
yeah

4176.06 --> 4181.339000000001
you know that the greenhouse gases CO2

4179.719 --> 4184.699
all that

4181.339 --> 4185.659
you know that plants actually use that

4184.699 --> 4189.199
right

4185.659 --> 4191.659
literally locally they use it they need

4189.199 --> 4195.139999999999
it they Thrive off it every time

4191.659 --> 4198.799999999999
somebody says oh it's less emissions

4195.14 --> 4200.4800000000005
it's like oh oh so less gifts to Nature

4198.8 --> 4203.02
then

4200.48 --> 4203.0199999999995
right

4217.699 --> 4223.5199999999995

4251.54 --> 4255.1
the Chinese some of them

4268.659 --> 4272.92
hey iron 26.

4273.44 --> 4277.839999999999
there'll be too much of a good thing

4275.179 --> 4277.84
really

4277.94 --> 4283.36
do you know that from experience I doubt

4281.3 --> 4283.360000000001
it

4289.64 --> 4292.12
oh no no

4292.52 --> 4297.38
too much of a good thing how about the

4296.0 --> 4300.26
entire

4297.38 --> 4304.400000000001
angle of approach with the idea of

4300.26 --> 4308.12
climate change Greenhouse emissions is a

4304.4 --> 4312.5599999999995
complete garbage illusion

4308.12 --> 4314.84
it's wrong it's so incredibly wrong in a

4312.56 --> 4316.76
lot of things that it should completely

4314.84 --> 4318.1
be wiped off the map

4316.76 --> 4319.76
just like

4318.1 --> 4323.4800000000005
screw you

4319.76 --> 4327.14
that that doesn't mean like oh let's

4323.48 --> 4329.839999999999
like Mega outputted right let's build

4327.14 --> 4332.84
some Factory and like oh well

4329.84 --> 4335.78
let's just do overdo it like a hundred

4332.84 --> 4338.96
thousand or a million times output in

4335.78 --> 4339.679
CO2 right okay yeah that might get a

4338.96 --> 4343.159
little

4339.679 --> 4347.06
Overkill wouldn't want that to happen

4343.159 --> 4350.96
but just this idea that taking away the

4347.06 --> 4353.4800000000005
CO2 is somehow good for anything it

4350.96 --> 4356.0
isn't it's actually not good for

4353.48 --> 4357.259999999999
anything literally

4356.0 --> 4360.44
because

4357.26 --> 4362.84
all these production gases

4360.44 --> 4368.299999999999
just things like CO2

4362.84 --> 4373.1
it's going it's the nature uses it

4368.3 --> 4375.679
it nature thrives on it literally

4373.1 --> 4377.780000000001
so this entire rumor like oh less

4375.679 --> 4380.9
greenhouse gases that's supposed to be

4377.78 --> 4384.46
good what for for your squirting fear

4380.9 --> 4384.46
over that the world's gonna end

4384.56 --> 4388.64
they were all going to get fried or

4386.659 --> 4391.839999999999
frozen or everything gonna warp around

4388.64 --> 4396.62
because it's a planet it's a planet and

4391.84 --> 4399.92
the climate this stabilization and blah

4396.62 --> 4403.239
blah complete garbage

4399.92 --> 4403.2390000000005
total nonsense

4407.3 --> 4410.26
it's a scam

4413.0 --> 4418.159
right now if you output massive amounts

4416.36 --> 4423.0199999999995
of gases

4418.159 --> 4424.82
some sort yeah that should get that that

4423.02 --> 4427.159000000001
should probably be approached as okay

4424.82 --> 4429.08
that's like terraforming processing

4427.159 --> 4433.219
right that's that shouldn't just be

4429.08 --> 4436.3
anybody do whatever you like right no

4433.219 --> 4436.3
but to say

4436.76 --> 4442.219
like we should remove some aspects of

4440.179 --> 4445.28
Industry because we want to get rid of

4442.219 --> 4448.88
CO2 because it's supposedly detrimental

4445.28 --> 4451.719
is absolutely the most idiotic delusion

4448.88 --> 4451.719
ever

4451.88 --> 4457.2390000000005
totally delusional

4454.76 --> 4460.219
should be removed

4457.239 --> 4462.139999999999
dispelled entirely

4460.219 --> 4465.76
right because

4462.14 --> 4465.76
it's kind of like the

4468.62 --> 4476.599999999999
how I think it came into being is that

4471.88 --> 4479.36
once environmental interest came about

4476.6 --> 4481.9400000000005
a lot of Industries and chemical

4479.36 --> 4484.339999999999
processing they started to try and

4481.94 --> 4486.5599999999995
figure out like how do we minimize the

4484.34 --> 4488.659000000001
actual pollution

4486.56 --> 4492.26
poisonous influence

4488.659 --> 4495.139999999999
how do materials transform over time and

4492.26 --> 4496.400000000001
become neutralized less damaging how

4495.14 --> 4499.1
those little in like true

4496.4 --> 4501.86
environmentalism right well they got a

4499.1 --> 4504.4400000000005
lot of that figured out and then these

4501.86 --> 4506.239
[ __ ] satanic pieces of [ __ ] Grabbers

4504.44 --> 4510.879999999999
thought

4506.239 --> 4514.699
let's turn it into a cult let's say CO2

4510.88 --> 4517.58
the like the thing that is not directly

4514.699 --> 4519.919999999999
dangerous was actually Pro good for the

4517.58 --> 4522.5599999999995
environment let's say that it is evil

4519.92 --> 4524.36
let's base the entire [ __ ] industry

4522.56 --> 4527.900000000001
on trying to get rid of that and

4524.36 --> 4529.4
indoctrinating like CO2 is the ultimate

4527.9 --> 4532.4
Danger

4529.4 --> 4534.92
let's get everybody away from actual

4532.4 --> 4537.739
knowledge over what pollutes the

4534.92 --> 4541.04
environment for real let's get them all

4537.739 --> 4542.839999999999
focused on [ __ ] CO2 right he hate

4541.04 --> 4545.84
that they did that

4542.84 --> 4545.84
foreign

4551.98 --> 4556.28
piece of [ __ ] I hope

4554.78 --> 4559.219
I hope

4556.28 --> 4561.38
he goes out flying one day on this CO2

4559.219 --> 4564.56
pumping private jet

4561.38 --> 4567.1990000000005
and then like get like the autopilot

4564.56 --> 4569.84
gets damaged and he flies straight into

4567.199 --> 4572.78
a into an active volcano that's what I

4569.84 --> 4573.92
hope like let let him just go straight

4572.78 --> 4575.54
to hell

4573.92 --> 4578.26
just like that

4575.54 --> 4582.64
that will be a proper end

4578.26 --> 4585.8
for that piece of [ __ ] called leader

4582.64 --> 4588.6990000000005
anti-environmental cult leader Al Gore

4585.8 --> 4588.6990000000005
son of a [ __ ]

4590.199 --> 4595.28
anti-environmentalism right the CO2 hype

4592.94 --> 4597.98
climate change it's anti

4595.28 --> 4602.38
environmentalism

4597.98 --> 4602.379999999999
oh is it too much for you oh

4607.28 --> 4610.78
I miss my tea

4612.92 --> 4617.7390000000005
I didn't get I didn't have time to make

4615.5 --> 4617.739
any

4653.8 --> 4659.92
abuses the grabber

4656.0 --> 4659.92
they don't abuse the grappler

4660.26 --> 4666.5
they abuse everybody else I just like to

4663.26 --> 4669.92
point it out no mercy

4666.5 --> 4672.08
I I like to show the consequences of

4669.92 --> 4675.02
what they do

4672.08 --> 4678.38
and how they basically say a lot of real

4675.02 --> 4679.580000000001
Satanism the real evil Satanism is doing

4678.38 --> 4682.34
for them

4679.58 --> 4684.98
to realize that something that [ __ ]

4682.34 --> 4688.28
devious and evil is in control it

4684.98 --> 4691.4
becomes too much they fear that the

4688.28 --> 4693.98
thing that they've rested on

4691.4 --> 4696.32
will actually turn into a giant evil

4693.98 --> 4699.5
slave master so they can't handle that

4696.32 --> 4701.719
switch and they just say no I'm going to

4699.5 --> 4703.88
trust it anyway it's part of the trick

4701.719 --> 4706.28
it's part of the illusion

4703.88 --> 4707.84
of the satanic spell of the Reversed

4706.28 --> 4710.96
world

4707.84 --> 4713.54
the confrontation with reality is made

4710.96 --> 4715.88
too much to handle

4713.54 --> 4719.0
that's how they keep people Spellbound

4715.88 --> 4723.5
even if others point out to them like

4719.0 --> 4725.42
this is evil they'll be like no no

4723.5 --> 4729.14
and the ball Earth

4725.42 --> 4731.42
is is also kind of like that

4729.14 --> 4733.219
it's the same system really it's because

4731.42 --> 4736.179
just its influence has been just

4733.219 --> 4736.179
gargantuan

4738.4 --> 4744.339999999999
climate change is

4741.32 --> 4744.34
still kind of young

4745.1 --> 4748.3
it's a much younger spell

4762.32 --> 4770.179
all right it's 26 degrees over here

4766.58 --> 4770.179
YouTube serious

4787.699 --> 4794.678999999999
hey Mark colored how are you doing

4791.36 --> 4794.679
I'm doing just fine

4820.12 --> 4827.86
okay that's good to hear more color

4823.82 --> 4827.86
that you go through some rough time

4834.44 --> 4839.299999999999
fry an egg up on it

4837.38 --> 4841.76
oh

4839.3 --> 4845.78
oh are you leaving it open in the sun

4841.76 --> 4848.54
you might want to put it in the shadow

4845.78 --> 4852.0199999999995
my computer can get pretty hot too if I

4848.54 --> 4854.6
let the sun just sit on it

4852.02 --> 4857.2390000000005
then again my computer does

4854.6 --> 4860.5
it is very efficient so it just doesn't

4857.239 --> 4860.5
really overheat too much

4864.02 --> 4867.88
oh God your cousin died

4891.26 --> 4893.26
um

4900.679 --> 4905.26
oh right comforting videos

4908.6 --> 4912.92
well maybe you should have a special

4910.699 --> 4916.0
power fan

4912.92 --> 4916.0
in your PC

4916.1 --> 4920.719
like if you're gonna have overheating

4918.86 --> 4924.799999999999
situations

4920.719 --> 4928.159
you you can have like a noisy fan that

4924.8 --> 4931.28
just normally doesn't turn on unless you

4928.159 --> 4932.96
get like a really heavy activities and

4931.28 --> 4935.12
then it would turn on

4932.96 --> 4937.04
to cool it all down but it wouldn't be

4935.12 --> 4938.96
noisy right so you don't do it during

4937.04 --> 4941.139
live streams or watching a show or

4938.96 --> 4941.139
something

4942.98 --> 4947.08
right now

4944.239 --> 4947.08
that could work

4957.56 --> 4961.900000000001
all right Marco which one did he take

4962.48 --> 4965.48
hmm

4972.22 --> 4975.369000000001
[Music]

4993.139 --> 4999.08
oh Jesus

4996.08 --> 4999.08
foreign

5002.38 --> 5007.84
like Mark Collard yeah

5004.9 --> 5011.0199999999995
I'm a little nervous myself I still have

5007.84 --> 5013.6
like family out there that I I don't

5011.02 --> 5015.34
really have contact with actually I'm

5013.6 --> 5016.2390000000005
kind of a black sheep never got out of

5015.34 --> 5018.400000000001
that

5016.239 --> 5021.718999999999
don't know why

5018.4 --> 5021.719
well yeah I do know why

5022.12 --> 5024.599999999999
but

5027.28 --> 5032.259999999999
I Hope they've all been wise enough to

5030.34 --> 5034.78
realize like you don't take that

5032.26 --> 5036.6990000000005
freaking vaccine no matter what I really

5034.78 --> 5040.3
hope they did

5036.699 --> 5044.199
otherwise I'd might might end up having

5040.3 --> 5047.139
some more deaths in the family as well

5044.199 --> 5048.94
I'm just really glad my dad is totally

5047.139 --> 5053.1990000000005
on

5048.94 --> 5054.339999999999
onto it knows what's going on with flat

5053.199 --> 5056.44
Earth too

5054.34 --> 5060.0
to a certain degree it like he likes to

5056.44 --> 5060.0
be informed about it through me

5061.42 --> 5066.52
right

5063.28 --> 5069.099999999999
so he's like on the safe spot

5066.52 --> 5072.46
he's he's home free he's not gonna it's

5069.1 --> 5074.8
not gonna happen to him I know it's like

5072.46 --> 5076.719
if it's gonna happen to him to my dad

5074.8 --> 5079.06
then it's probably gonna happen to me

5076.719 --> 5080.4
too and yeah then all the worlds go and

5079.06 --> 5083.320000000001
go to [ __ ]

5080.4 --> 5087.82
literally It's Gonna Be Crazy Action

5083.32 --> 5089.98
time right but yeah the rest of my

5087.82 --> 5092.259999999999
family I don't know I don't know where

5089.98 --> 5094.599999999999
they're at I don't know how how

5092.26 --> 5097.860000000001
vulnerable they are to societal

5094.6 --> 5097.860000000001
influence like that

5099.76 --> 5103.96
just hope they're wise enough to to keep

5102.52 --> 5107.1990000000005
away that

5103.96 --> 5111.639
they are all kind of smart like they do

5107.199 --> 5113.86
have perceptional smartness so it's they

5111.639 --> 5116.08
know Bill Gates is a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

5113.86 --> 5118.239
a creep and a eugenicist and he's really

5116.08 --> 5121.36
like they wouldn't fall for that [ __ ]

5118.239 --> 5123.58
right they're not stupid so I hope that

5121.36 --> 5127.799999999999
they're all just staying clear and that

5123.58 --> 5131.739
I don't have to hear one day like

5127.8 --> 5134.8
another cousin or my brother

5131.739 --> 5137.44
or a nephew or something died from the

5134.8 --> 5138.9400000000005
shot I really hope I don't have to learn

5137.44 --> 5143.28
about that

5138.94 --> 5143.28
that that's not gonna happen huh

5150.34 --> 5155.4400000000005
it's like it sounds bad but I I would

5152.5 --> 5157.659
feel feel it as an embarrassment if that

5155.44 --> 5159.58
would happen to one of them

5157.659 --> 5162.9
that's like a shame on the family for

5159.58 --> 5162.9
not seeing through that [ __ ]

5162.94 --> 5170.04
but hey that's me right that's me weird

5165.639 --> 5170.04
old Arwin and with family

5184.96 --> 5190.06
you are being forced and pressured or

5187.84 --> 5192.52
really have you tried a knife

5190.06 --> 5194.679
like oh you force me oh how about I

5192.52 --> 5196.7390000000005
[ __ ] Force this knife in your throat

5194.679 --> 5201.36
[ __ ]

5196.739 --> 5201.36
what force you how

5203.32 --> 5208.719
tear it it sounds terrible

5206.44 --> 5211.5599999999995
my response a little Overkill but yeah

5208.719 --> 5214.4800000000005
that that is like oh really

5211.56 --> 5217.84
you forced me to take it oh well how

5214.48 --> 5221.4
about I force you to [ __ ] die in a

5217.84 --> 5221.400000000001
more overt way how about that

5222.4 --> 5227.5
uh

5224.679 --> 5228.88
Walmart sells machetes for five dollars

5227.5 --> 5231.1
yeah

5228.88 --> 5234.6
right it's a lot cheaper

5231.1 --> 5234.6
and slash polluting

5236.5 --> 5243.179
right because even all these [ __ ]

5239.02 --> 5246.6990000000005
vaccines are just incredibly

5243.179 --> 5250.36
poisonous not just to take it in it's

5246.699 --> 5253.839999999999
like it's literal poison on every level

5250.36 --> 5256.179
like even if you throw that [ __ ] away

5253.84 --> 5258.88
like if you will throw this garbage on

5256.179 --> 5262.12
Plants it will probably be very bad for

5258.88 --> 5265.719
them as well right it's it's poison it's

5262.12 --> 5267.639
pure pollution poison medical waste

5265.719 --> 5269.8
garbage

5267.639 --> 5272.5
nothing is good about it it should all

5269.8 --> 5276.1
be destroyed in my opinion all of it

5272.5 --> 5279.219
just like incinerated that there is no

5276.1 --> 5281.02
remnant of it left it's pure poisonous

5279.219 --> 5283.42
garbage

5281.02 --> 5285.96
[ __ ] vaccines I hate that they are

5283.42 --> 5288.28
doing this I really hate it from an

5285.96 --> 5290.679
environmentalist perspective

5288.28 --> 5292.719
pure garbage and like all these people

5290.679 --> 5295.659
that die with it too

5292.719 --> 5297.34
they have the toxic [ __ ] in them how are

5295.659 --> 5298.42
they gonna are they gonna be buried well

5297.34 --> 5300.46
then it's going to be in the ground

5298.42 --> 5302.5
there are they going to be burnt then

5300.46 --> 5304.6
it's gonna turn into fumes and spread

5302.5 --> 5306.699
around like that it's pure chemical

5304.6 --> 5309.219
waste garbage

5306.699 --> 5312.28
terrible stuff

5309.219 --> 5313.2390000000005
so yeah Hatchet it's only five dollars

5312.28 --> 5315.239
you say

5313.239 --> 5317.98
it's not gonna leave a lot of

5315.239 --> 5320.0199999999995
environmentalist garbage right so it's

5317.98 --> 5322.12
much more efficient that way

5320.02 --> 5324.34
I know it's a little crazy to talk about

5322.12 --> 5327.58
it like that

5324.34 --> 5331.7390000000005
I just really really hate this [ __ ]

5327.58 --> 5331.739
facts called I really hate them

5338.8 --> 5345.06
they're all Vex damage also to some

5341.92 --> 5345.06
degree speak for yourself

5345.88 --> 5352.06
I had a few shots but nothing like you

5349.9 --> 5358.199
would get in America

5352.06 --> 5358.1990000000005
like I had like two that's it that's all

5360.28 --> 5364.44
and they were actual vaccination

5365.26 --> 5369.2390000000005
it's like children's disease vaccination

5369.46 --> 5377.679
that's good that's good enough

5373.36 --> 5379.659
right in retrospect I might if I knew

5377.679 --> 5381.34
everything back then that I did now and

5379.659 --> 5383.94
my parents did then I might have even

5381.34 --> 5383.9400000000005
skipped that

5384.34 --> 5390.400000000001
because there's so much

5386.98 --> 5392.379999999999
that we can do outside of all that to

5390.4 --> 5395.0199999999995
improve your immune system and to live

5392.38 --> 5398.1990000000005
through it to just understand how all

5395.02 --> 5402.1
these things work is also a stabilizing

5398.199 --> 5404.799999999999
Factor on your overall immune system

5402.1 --> 5406.360000000001
the psychosomatic influence just knowing

5404.8 --> 5409.26
that

5406.36 --> 5409.259999999999
it helps

5413.679 --> 5418.6
yeah but don't squirt over all of it

5416.739 --> 5420.699
though right

5418.6 --> 5423.820000000001
like this new

5420.699 --> 5426.5199999999995
gene therapy

5423.82 --> 5429.58
like it is really harmful

5426.52 --> 5432.280000000001
compared to classical vaccination with

5429.58 --> 5435.82
some mercury in it yeah yeah I know it's

5432.28 --> 5438.58
it's not good then again nerve cells can

5435.82 --> 5441.239
actually regenerate right

5438.58 --> 5441.239
so

5441.28 --> 5446.739
this new stuff however is completely

5443.98 --> 5448.239
different it's a whole nother scale of

5446.739 --> 5450.58
toxic

5448.239 --> 5453.339999999999
so you can't really compare it right so

5450.58 --> 5455.199
if you say a real facts damage well that

5453.34 --> 5457.6
sounds a little bit like an exaggeration

5455.199 --> 5460.48
right you don't know like if you got

5457.6 --> 5462.820000000001
like the mega booster [ __ ]

5460.48 --> 5465.099999999999
as a very little kid where you get like

5462.82 --> 5468.639
50 or 60 or whatever they do in in

5465.1 --> 5470.679
America yeah that's that's vaccine

5468.639 --> 5472.4800000000005
damaged probably

5470.679 --> 5476.679
yeah

5472.48 --> 5479.259999999999
if you just got a few very limited

5476.679 --> 5482.92
I don't know it it doesn't have to

5479.26 --> 5484.659000000001
completely derail your development your

5482.92 --> 5488.219
mental development or anything I don't

5484.659 --> 5488.219
think it does necessarily

5489.94 --> 5492.54
right

5494.56 --> 5497.280000000001
like

5498.76 --> 5504.88
yeah I am not against classical

5502.179 --> 5507.28
vaccination I am against forcing

5504.88 --> 5510.58
everybody to get vaccinated and I always

5507.28 --> 5512.639
will be it must always all of it be on a

5510.58 --> 5516.94
purely voluntary

5512.639 --> 5519.46
decision based system always

5516.94 --> 5521.919999999999
because everybody is responsible for

5519.46 --> 5524.199
their own medical conduct and they must

5521.92 --> 5525.52
have the decision

5524.199 --> 5528.4
always

5525.52 --> 5532.120000000001
it must never be allowed to be forced

5528.4 --> 5536.32
ever by an outsider

5532.12 --> 5540.54
family will always be the judge the

5536.32 --> 5540.54
decision maker in The Taking of it

5541.719 --> 5546.699
and I think that's even backed up by the

5543.639 --> 5548.9400000000005
Nuremberg code so if I'm fully behind

5546.699 --> 5548.94
that

5553.84 --> 5560.92
right but yeah vaccination what is it

5557.199 --> 5562.719
right it's you expose your body certain

5560.92 --> 5565.12
bacteria

5562.719 --> 5567.52
it might be hostile then they're

5565.12 --> 5570.219
supposedly pacified through the Mercury

5567.52 --> 5572.4400000000005
or whatever right that's the idea the

5570.219 --> 5574.96
idea is you pacify it then your body

5572.44 --> 5577.96
gets a chance to bump into it and then

5574.96 --> 5580.3
develop immune system response because

5577.96 --> 5582.34
of it while you don't get the disease

5580.3 --> 5583.06
although sometimes you do actually get

5582.34 --> 5586.06
it

5583.06 --> 5588.159000000001
right that's part of it is it's a it's a

5586.06 --> 5590.320000000001
bit of a risky system always has been

5588.159 --> 5593.259999999999
never that's always been part of

5590.32 --> 5595.0
original vaccination

5593.26 --> 5598.3
right but

5595.0 --> 5599.44
there's other ways of doing that same

5598.3 --> 5602.5
thing

5599.44 --> 5606.339999999999
it's literally called exposure one of my

5602.5 --> 5608.86
methods is as I say okay ensure you

5606.34 --> 5611.08
breastfeed your kids it's really

5608.86 --> 5613.599999999999
important

5611.08 --> 5616.3
even like the idea of getting

5613.6 --> 5618.34
breastfeeding from other mothers

5616.3 --> 5619.719
exchanging breastfeeding sounds a little

5618.34 --> 5622.42
weird right

5619.719 --> 5625.78
it's like what put my baby on another

5622.42 --> 5628.84
woman's tit what is this well

5625.78 --> 5632.259999999999
you might be surprised because every

5628.84 --> 5634.179
mother's milk has a known

5632.26 --> 5636.820000000001
history

5634.179 --> 5639.46
like immune history that's encoded

5636.82 --> 5642.82
within that breast milk so if you cross

5639.46 --> 5644.8
mix you might actually get more

5642.82 --> 5646.9
right so that's a good way to boost the

5644.8 --> 5649.84
immune system and then if that is all

5646.9 --> 5652.719
filled up then the exposure can truly

5649.84 --> 5654.6990000000005
happen right it's also like baby stop

5652.719 --> 5657.58
drinking that's when they start crawling

5654.699 --> 5659.739
around shoving [ __ ] in their face you're

5657.58 --> 5663.46
putting it in their mouth right that's

5659.739 --> 5664.9
because it's the exposure period in

5663.46 --> 5666.699
their development that's when they

5664.9 --> 5668.08
actually need it well that's the time

5666.699 --> 5670.48
you bring your kid

5668.08 --> 5673.36
to the forest where you know the ground

5670.48 --> 5676.659
is safe and unpolluted and you let them

5673.36 --> 5679.0599999999995
just [ __ ] around roll around in the dirt

5676.659 --> 5681.82
and leave the [ __ ] shove it in their

5679.06 --> 5684.04
face put it everywhere and that's a

5681.82 --> 5686.139
really good way to be exposed to a lot

5684.04 --> 5688.78
of natural bacteria and get a really

5686.139 --> 5690.76
strong immune system but it's very

5688.78 --> 5693.04
important that if you do that with your

5690.76 --> 5696.58
in with your kid

5693.04 --> 5698.38
that they have the proper immune backing

5696.58 --> 5699.54
through best breastfeeding because if

5698.38 --> 5702.9400000000005
they don't

5699.54 --> 5704.679
then those dirt influences may have a

5702.94 --> 5706.239
little bit too much impact and their

5704.679 --> 5708.34
immune system might not be able to

5706.239 --> 5710.98
handle it completely properly right

5708.34 --> 5713.26
people that don't have breastfeeding

5710.98 --> 5715.659
that haven't been raised with that they

5713.26 --> 5718.360000000001
often develop allergies

5715.659 --> 5721.36
in association and this like they get

5718.36 --> 5723.04
really diseased they get really they get

5721.36 --> 5726.46
infected by something and it hits them

5723.04 --> 5728.08
really bad they get fevers a lot

5726.46 --> 5730.3
because

5728.08 --> 5732.96
yeah they didn't get breastfed it

5730.3 --> 5732.96
matters a lot

5733.96 --> 5739.78
so yeah vaccines it's based on an

5737.199 --> 5742.78
exposure principle but you can't do that

5739.78 --> 5746.139
without sticking needles in your arm

5742.78 --> 5750.36
you can do that other ways natural ways

5746.139 --> 5750.36
throat sheer exposure right

5751.3 --> 5757.0
what is it like Gerald Celente from his

5754.42 --> 5759.219
own Infowars sometimes I've been

5757.0 --> 5761.94
following him in way back even like is

5759.219 --> 5765.34
it this is an older man but he's Italian

5761.94 --> 5769.36
spirited and he tells the story about

5765.34 --> 5770.860000000001
how back in the old days like old

5769.36 --> 5775.32
New York

5770.86 --> 5778.96
the kids would just swim in the water

5775.32 --> 5781.0
just like the river water outside and it

5778.96 --> 5783.58
was like there are sewage pipes coming

5781.0 --> 5786.219
out in there so it was really dirty with

5783.58 --> 5788.739
literal [ __ ] floating around sometimes

5786.219 --> 5791.679
and yeah some of them got really sick

5788.739 --> 5794.259999999999
but others they got like iron strong

5791.679 --> 5797.5
immune systems it's again it's the same

5794.26 --> 5800.88
principle exposure right not saying oh

5797.5 --> 5803.5
swimming raw sewage

5800.88 --> 5806.7390000000005
you got to be pretty well prepared and

5803.5 --> 5809.26
breast fat to even risk that in my

5806.739 --> 5811.78
opinion that that idea like even is a

5809.26 --> 5814.02
little scary to me but it's all about

5811.78 --> 5816.759999999999
exposure

5814.02 --> 5818.56
exposure after your immune system is

5816.76 --> 5820.659000000001
strong enough

5818.56 --> 5824.56
and that's really what actual

5820.659 --> 5826.36
vaccination is like built upon upon that

5824.56 --> 5828.9400000000005
principle and then turning it into a

5826.36 --> 5830.98
more simplified medical procedure

5828.94 --> 5834.099999999999
right that's

5830.98 --> 5836.619
what it is that shouldn't be just

5834.1 --> 5839.38
because the freaking covet vaccine which

5836.619 --> 5840.759999999999
is in a vaccine it's a gene therapy just

5839.38 --> 5844.659000000001
because this is happening doesn't mean

5840.76 --> 5846.88
like oh it's all bad it's all bad you

5844.659 --> 5850.299999999999
shouldn't allow that ever just erase it

5846.88 --> 5852.04
from the system no no that's what Satan

5850.3 --> 5855.34
does every time

5852.04 --> 5857.26
Satan corrupt something good

5855.34 --> 5859.84
and then makes

5857.26 --> 5865.780000000001
his subjects

5859.84 --> 5871.119000000001
either die or reject it and then destroy

5865.78 --> 5874.48
and erase the thing that Satan used

5871.119 --> 5876.9
to do that right they amplify something

5874.48 --> 5879.759999999999
just like climate change they take

5876.9 --> 5882.099999999999
actual environmentalism which is a very

5879.76 --> 5885.280000000001
legitimate thing

5882.1 --> 5888.58
conjure this stupid CO2 thing and then

5885.28 --> 5891.099999999999
make everybody realize it's false and

5888.58 --> 5892.96
hate environmentalism it becomes a

5891.1 --> 5895.3
Target environmentalism becomes a Target

5892.96 --> 5897.28
because of what it did That's what Satan

5895.3 --> 5899.619000000001
does the spirit of it

5897.28 --> 5901.54
true evil take something good you're

5899.619 --> 5904.38
corrupted then you make everybody hate

5901.54 --> 5904.38
that good thing

5904.48 --> 5909.659
so that they will reject the good thing

5907.239 --> 5909.659
right

5909.76 --> 5913.96
so yeah

5911.56 --> 5916.4800000000005
I'm gonna round out the show

5913.96 --> 5920.46
Flat Earth debates already started up so

5916.48 --> 5920.459999999999
yeah I hope you appreciate this

5920.619 --> 5925.199
little summary

5922.78 --> 5927.94
bit of medical

5925.199 --> 5930.339999999999
Grassroots information this is more just

Earth early bird number 912 on the

5962.38 --> 5965.4400000000005
Wednesday

5963.88 --> 5967.3
and I'm going to join the flight Earth

5965.44 --> 5970.299999999999

much right because even if I'm

5983.139 --> 5988.659000000001
distracted or demoralized I can quickly

5986.38 --> 5990.82
reflect on something you guys are

5988.659 --> 5992.86
talking about and then get into that it

5990.82 --> 5995.739
works so much better than when they're

5992.86 --> 5998.619
like hello somebody gonna say something

5995.739 --> 6000.839999999999
right so I really appreciate your
