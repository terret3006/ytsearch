78.159 --> 82.96000000000001
so

79.6 --> 82.96
the weather today is

83.04 --> 89.68
kind of warm

86.4 --> 89.68
and there's not a lot of wind

90.24 --> 94.079
still yeah

91.84 --> 96.56
like the sun

94.079 --> 99.119
does come through but it's it's like a

96.56 --> 101.52
little bit more hazy

99.119 --> 104.079
up there even beyond like the real

101.52 --> 104.079
clouds

104.159 --> 110.799
but it's just really nice and warm and i

107.119 --> 110.799
walked around on the roof earlier

113.28 --> 117.92
so yeah

115.439 --> 117.91999999999999
don't know

118.0 --> 122.32
might be getting even a little bit more

120.159 --> 124.0
cloudy later on

122.32 --> 128.35999999999999
could be

124.0 --> 128.36
but right now it's nice

128.959 --> 131.84
even though cloud

136.959 --> 139.959
right

141.44 --> 146.959
[Music]

143.44 --> 148.56
starting exactly on time for a change

146.959 --> 151.12
man

148.56 --> 155.08
how the yeah the alarm clock situation

151.12 --> 155.08
is working out for me

157.76 --> 162.64
because i did get sleepier earlier

160.4 --> 165.519
because of it

162.64 --> 168.48
so yeah my uh

165.519 --> 171.04
my subconscious sleeping rhythm guiding

168.48 --> 173.28
systems seem to get the hint pretty

171.04 --> 175.12
quickly and that's nice

173.28 --> 177.519
so i'm just gonna keep it like that for

175.12 --> 177.519
a while

178.319 --> 183.04
uh

180.0 --> 185.84
so yeah yesterday man what a day

183.04 --> 185.84
serious

186.8 --> 194.48000000000002
there were some really

190.08 --> 194.48000000000002
like there was intense energy yesterday

194.72 --> 201.92
and that reflected on many streams

198.159 --> 204.07999999999998
well for starters flat earth debates

201.92 --> 206.879
i got in there

204.08 --> 209.20000000000002
and like literally as soon as nathan

206.879 --> 211.35999999999999
added me and he started very late well

209.2 --> 213.83999999999997
figured out quickly why because as soon

211.36 --> 215.36
as i got in there was like immediately i

213.84 --> 217.92000000000002
heard him yelling at the top of his

215.36 --> 220.72000000000003
lungs like

217.92 --> 223.04
nathan has got one

220.72 --> 227.35999999999999
he was mauling down

223.04 --> 229.519
this guy though holy [Â __Â ] man

227.36 --> 229.519
like

230.319 --> 234.0
he sounded

231.76 --> 236.319
he had like the voice type and the

234.0 --> 239.439
jittering like almost like he was ben

236.319 --> 243.28
shapiro or something

239.439 --> 245.92
and like man that lasted long like

243.28 --> 249.04
two past six for me

245.92 --> 249.04
so the after show

249.28 --> 254.36
was

250.72 --> 254.35999999999999
yeah two hours

254.64 --> 259.759
and he hung in there like till the end

257.759 --> 264.24
was he just wouldn't give up this guy

259.759 --> 264.24
was like more tenacious than rumpus

265.36 --> 271.36
also more annoying i thought but

269.84 --> 274.23999999999995
but yeah

271.36 --> 276.47900000000004
that was pretty intense

274.24 --> 280.56
friday flat earth debate show which is

276.479 --> 283.75899999999996
we should see that all back on sunday

280.56 --> 285.28000000000003
hello dusty ryder first in chat

283.759 --> 288.24
snowbirds

285.28 --> 291.19899999999996
it's a clockwise star trailer yes yes

288.24 --> 294.84000000000003
but not just that and maybe perhaps this

291.199 --> 298.639
is going to be a little bit of spoiler

294.84 --> 302.71999999999997
but he basically said i was a flat

298.639 --> 305.199
earther this is what i learned

302.72 --> 308.0
and then he actually presented like the

305.199 --> 311.44
clock like oh why do they turn the other

308.0 --> 313.759
way when i turn around

311.44 --> 316.639
he held that up like that was a

313.759 --> 318.47900000000004
legitimate reason to step away from flat

316.639 --> 319.919
earth complete

318.479 --> 323.88
insanity

319.919 --> 323.88
it was really devious

325.199 --> 329.28000000000003
like

326.479 --> 332.15999999999997
that had to be a lie and imagine like he

329.28 --> 332.15999999999997
was acting

333.68 --> 336.96
and he was a pathological lie a double

335.68 --> 339.039
spoke like

336.96 --> 340.4
so many times eventually in the last

339.039 --> 343.52
hour

340.4 --> 346.15999999999997
like every sentence like in one sentence

343.52 --> 348.24
you would say one thing then in one

346.16 --> 350.32000000000005
breath follow it up by the exact

348.24 --> 352.16
opposite and then ask like i never said

350.32 --> 355.039
that

352.16 --> 357.03900000000004
completely pathological totally out of

355.039 --> 359.199
his mind

357.039 --> 362.15999999999997
that was just wow

359.199 --> 362.16
so that happened

362.24 --> 367.319
and then

364.0 --> 367.319
very intense

368.0 --> 374.4
yeah owen benjamin had somebody on

371.84 --> 376.71999999999997
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

374.4 --> 376.71999999999997
yeah

377.759 --> 382.88
you're probably gonna need some extra

380.319 --> 385.199
rest after yesterday's show man that

382.88 --> 387.84
that was so much energy

385.199 --> 387.84000000000003
great show

388.24 --> 395.039
but owen benjamin had somebody on

391.52 --> 398.56
who i've never seen before and i was

395.039 --> 398.56
quite literally shocked

400.639 --> 403.68
it's his name again

405.52 --> 412.71999999999997
where did i post that

409.36 --> 412.72
did i post it anywhere

413.52 --> 417.919
in skype

415.12 --> 417.919
not sure now

421.12 --> 424.08
right it's not about

425.919 --> 429.12
uh

426.96 --> 430.15999999999997
not

429.12 --> 433.28000000000003
not my

430.16 --> 435.68
made by jim bob he's also like a

433.28 --> 438.0
a friend of owen benjamin's

435.68 --> 439.199
several streams together and he seems to

438.0 --> 440.96
be

439.199 --> 442.8
quite into the flat earth debating

440.96 --> 444.15999999999997
quantum eraser by his own shout out

442.8 --> 446.88
right now

444.16 --> 450.91900000000004
he did that on yesterday's show

446.88 --> 450.919
that was quite interesting

451.199 --> 456.479
because he's a pretty smart guy and very

453.599 --> 458.15999999999997
funny he has like voices and [Â __Â ]

456.479 --> 460.8
really funny guy and

458.16 --> 460.8
very smart

460.96 --> 466.479
but the guy own benjamin had on what the

463.44 --> 466.479
hell was his name again

469.44 --> 472.479
hold on let me dig

474.8 --> 480.24
oh yeah christopher gardner

478.0 --> 480.24
man

481.919 --> 486.08
like the way he put things together

486.56 --> 489.919
was

487.52 --> 489.919
very

490.56 --> 497.199
fractal thinking act and he knew so

493.599 --> 500.08
freaky like he knows that rudolf steiner

497.199 --> 503.039
and he just had so many good things to

500.08 --> 504.84
say esoterically and also weirdly enough

503.039 --> 506.56
he brought in

504.84 --> 509.11999999999995
like

506.56 --> 511.12
the moon map again and then cross

509.12 --> 514.32
referenced it with something else out

511.12 --> 518.68
there like an old tool

514.32 --> 518.6800000000001
and i was just like what

527.76 --> 534.3199999999999
but i i watched that stream twice again

530.72 --> 537.279
this morning and i'm just all loaded up

534.32 --> 539.839
because that guy is like well what i

537.279 --> 541.36
call being a wizard he's

539.839 --> 543.839
that guy is it too

541.36 --> 547.6800000000001
that's just that immediately stood out

543.839 --> 552.0
to me like that guy is on the frequency

547.68 --> 553.68
and has like really good ways to

552.0 --> 556.399
express it

553.68 --> 558.7199999999999
in a way that it fractally resonates

556.399 --> 560.48
like what i try

558.72 --> 562.64
i don't know

560.48 --> 565.12
i can't really judge but like

562.64 --> 566.48
i'm almost afraid he's even better than

565.12 --> 570.16
me right

566.48 --> 570.16
it's that heavy this is

571.519 --> 575.36
he's very calm

573.279 --> 579.76
i'm not calm i'm always like

575.36 --> 579.76
i'm very movie and very expressive

581.279 --> 587.279
so yeah i'm all loaded up with energy

584.32 --> 588.5600000000001
and also i got this really funny i think

587.279 --> 591.4399999999999
it's funny

588.56 --> 592.56
idea i typed it out in the early bird

591.44 --> 595.2790000000001
chat

592.56 --> 599.8389999999999
a sketch that's going to be just for

595.279 --> 599.8389999999999
like an owen benjamin ira sketch

600.16 --> 605.4399999999999
that i like i just can't stop seeing it

603.76 --> 607.76
in my head

605.44 --> 611.6
and like to have that

607.76 --> 611.6
like being made by mountain bear

611.839 --> 617.0400000000001
and may yeah we could probably just all

614.56 --> 619.76
put it together just from every samples

617.04 --> 622.3199999999999
from one own benjamin has all said so

619.76 --> 624.88
you could probably just do it

622.32 --> 627.36
but it's basically a

624.88 --> 629.6
a sketch based on the

627.36 --> 631.519
like the final

629.6 --> 632.48
scene in

631.519 --> 634.399
uh

632.48 --> 637.2
indiana jones and the chris

634.399 --> 638.72
kingdom of the crystal skull right

637.2 --> 640.48
yeah and

638.72 --> 642.64
like the scene where

640.48 --> 646.24
the russian agent

642.64 --> 648.0
faces off with the alien

646.24 --> 650.0
right

648.0 --> 653.44
and i just thought like okay if we just

650.0 --> 656.56
replace some of these faces here

653.44 --> 657.7600000000001
and instead of the russian agent we take

656.56 --> 661.68
ira

657.76 --> 664.72
right just like

661.68 --> 665.8389999999999
yeah you got to get it to get it

664.72 --> 668.64
and then

665.839 --> 670.6400000000001
the ancient alien in that supposed

668.64 --> 672.48
spaceship whatever you can change the

670.64 --> 675.04
background to whatever you like it's

672.48 --> 677.839
purely based on the

675.04 --> 680.0
on the esoterics of what is happening in

677.839 --> 682.32
that scene not doesn't have to be

680.0 --> 684.56
related to aliens or anything but you

682.32 --> 686.9590000000001
could potentially just take the movie

684.56 --> 689.5189999999999
and then paste [Â __Â ] over it that could

686.959 --> 691.5189999999999
be a way to express it too but

689.519 --> 693.12
mountain bear would if he'd latch onto

691.519 --> 694.8
it he'd just probably draw it all from

693.12 --> 696.64
scratch and maybe place it in some

694.8 --> 698.0
ancient mystical castle instead or

696.64 --> 700.56
something

698.0 --> 703.2
right so om benjamin

700.56 --> 705.279
the big bear being the alien and he's

703.2 --> 709.12
like in statues

705.279 --> 711.2
with the bare head thing on like statues

709.12 --> 713.36
could be stone or whatever

711.2 --> 715.839
holding a ladle

713.36 --> 717.12
and one of the statues is missing the

715.839 --> 718.5600000000001
ladle

717.12 --> 720.16
and then ira

718.56 --> 722.56
like

720.16 --> 725.519
gives the ladles no mention and they all

722.56 --> 727.5189999999999
like the whole scene in the unified

725.519 --> 729.68
and i was like oh

727.519 --> 733.44
jesus i want to know i want to

729.68 --> 734.959
understand what's it like to be a bear

733.44 --> 736.8800000000001
and then own benjamin like it doesn't

734.959 --> 738.8
even get in this movie it doesn't say

736.88 --> 740.48
anything it just looks like really

738.8 --> 741.68
strict maybe fire in the eyes or

740.48 --> 744.16
whatever

741.68 --> 746.3199999999999
and then you could depict it through

744.16 --> 748.0
like dream bubbles

746.32 --> 751.7600000000001
with pictures

748.0 --> 752.959
maybe a cool song that's really like

751.76 --> 755.12
what is it

752.959 --> 756.8389999999999
trumpet songs or whatever

755.12 --> 759.12
star wars style

756.839 --> 762.0790000000001
whatever and

759.12 --> 765.36
you just flash like summarized in

762.079 --> 769.04
singular pictures like the earth is flat

765.36 --> 772.0790000000001
like the maps that nobody talks about

769.04 --> 775.5999999999999
in a quick flash globe with crossed

772.079 --> 778.88
crossed out nukes being fake and like

775.6 --> 781.519
just as many typical awakening little

778.88 --> 783.12
thingies in short flashes

781.519 --> 785.04
and then i was like

783.12 --> 787.04
oh jesus

785.04 --> 788.48
gotta wake up again

787.04 --> 791.519
like oh no

788.48 --> 793.839
it's too much and then like he burns off

791.519 --> 795.2
like in his final squirt

793.839 --> 798.72
right

795.2 --> 800.88
that's the thing that i got in my head

798.72 --> 804.9590000000001
so i kind of hope

800.88 --> 804.959
that somebody is going to pass that on

805.519 --> 809.92
because that would just be really epic

808.399 --> 812.24
like i

809.92 --> 814.0
it would be cool to like get it maybe a

812.24 --> 815.36
verbal shout out but i don't even need

814.0 --> 817.44
credit like

815.36 --> 818.9590000000001
i'm basically like

817.44 --> 821.2790000000001
taking their

818.959 --> 823.4399999999999
legacy like mountain bears legacy own

821.279 --> 825.279
benjamin's legacy

823.44 --> 827.519
and just thinking up something that i

825.279 --> 830.24
think would be great if it would be made

827.519 --> 830.24
in this world

832.24 --> 836.5600000000001
right and you could put like everything

834.079 --> 837.68
in there and the funnier the better even

836.56 --> 840.0
right

837.68 --> 843.8389999999999
but it has to be like pretty heavy like

840.0 --> 843.839
moon landing fake and just

844.48 --> 850.0
everything that tends to like really be

847.44 --> 852.24
very heavy like whoa

850.0 --> 854.0
when you realize it the science like

852.24 --> 857.44
gravity is fake

854.0 --> 860.079
you could put einstein put in there

857.44 --> 862.399
you could put so many things in there

860.079 --> 864.16
just with short impressions and it would

862.399 --> 866.399
mean so much

864.16 --> 868.399
because you know the key people that are

866.399 --> 871.6
typically like the wizards of the past

868.399 --> 873.36
that kind of put this all together that

871.6 --> 874.72
we were supposed to believe

873.36 --> 878.5600000000001
right

874.72 --> 879.44
so like quickly flashing dream image

878.56 --> 881.5999999999999
and yeah

879.44 --> 884.399
like technically if you have no idea

881.6 --> 886.16
what's going on and you see his own

884.399 --> 887.76
benjamin things for the first time yeah

886.16 --> 890.3199999999999
if you're gonna see that you are gonna

887.76 --> 892.48
be shocked actually right but for those

890.32 --> 894.88
that already know this it'll just give

892.48 --> 897.12
you a real kick because of the esoterics

894.88 --> 899.8389999999999
of the situation

897.12 --> 899.839
ah

901.76 --> 905.04
so what do you guys think

909.68 --> 916.2399999999999
steamy traveler

912.959 --> 919.1199999999999
catholic church like chanting

916.24 --> 919.12
what the hell

924.32 --> 926.399
now

925.12 --> 929.04
asking questions

926.399 --> 931.12
is enchanting

929.04 --> 934.8
that makes no sense

931.12 --> 934.8
maybe it reminds you of it but

936.399 --> 940.199
hello ryan eartherton

944.079 --> 948.399
yeah you could put dusty right yeah you

946.24 --> 951.92
could put the ndt

948.399 --> 954.72
like that stuff you could put so many

951.92 --> 956.4799999999999
funny things in there like it's

954.72 --> 959.44
photoshop because it has to be you could

956.48 --> 961.04
put so many iconic clips in that quickly

959.44 --> 963.519
flash by with

961.04 --> 966.56
with sound even right it doesn't have to

963.519 --> 969.279
be purely visually only

966.56 --> 971.92
you could put so much very quickly in

969.279 --> 974.48
there like this awaken like give me all

971.92 --> 976.959
the information okay well big bear here

974.48 --> 978.8000000000001
you go and i was like oh jesus what did

976.959 --> 979.68
i ask for ah

978.8 --> 983.8389999999999
right

979.68 --> 983.8389999999999
it would be funny as [Â __Â ]

984.56 --> 986.959
and it would

985.759 --> 988.48
basically

986.959 --> 990.8
be

988.48 --> 994.16
what kingdom of the crystal skull in its

990.8 --> 995.519
own right that scene tried to be

994.16 --> 998.24
right

995.519 --> 1000.72
you do understand that part about it

998.24 --> 1004.0
like that's what that scene actually

1000.72 --> 1005.44
tried to be in the

1004.0 --> 1008.56
in the fake

1005.44 --> 1010.399
cosmology thinking

1008.56 --> 1013.68
like ooh too much information you can't

1010.399 --> 1016.399
handle it well guess what during that

1013.68 --> 1018.56
scene they didn't actually show any

1016.399 --> 1020.959
information they didn't show what the

1018.56 --> 1024.24
woman got to see it was just like whoa

1020.959 --> 1026.0
light and she said i see everything you

1024.24 --> 1028.24
don't know what that is well it's part

1026.0 --> 1029.6
very mysterious that that is the the

1028.24 --> 1032.24
appeal of it

1029.6 --> 1034.48
but you could literally just like show

1032.24 --> 1037.6
own benjamin in his bare head like fiery

1034.48 --> 1040.24
eyes oh you wanna know

1037.6 --> 1042.24
and then just

1040.24 --> 1045.52
yeah visuals

1042.24 --> 1048.72
flashing images and sayings and like to

1045.52 --> 1052.32
really show what that awakening thing is

1048.72 --> 1054.24
and it would be hilarious and amazing

1052.32 --> 1056.48
anyway

1054.24 --> 1056.48
ah

1056.72 --> 1059.28
i hope

1059.6 --> 1063.039
i hope they catch on to this

1063.919 --> 1070.0
i really want this

1066.4 --> 1071.76
idea to be passed on to mountain bear

1070.0 --> 1075.799
that would be epic

1071.76 --> 1075.799
and i know we could do this

1086.559 --> 1092.799
do i have editing software

1089.84 --> 1095.4399999999998
not really no

1092.799 --> 1097.52
and besides like

1095.44 --> 1099.8400000000001
if i would want to do it and this is

1097.52 --> 1103.36
like a part of own benjamin rules

1099.84 --> 1107.039
then i would have to make it my own

1103.36 --> 1108.4799999999998
signature i i don't really

1107.039 --> 1110.8799999999999
have a style

1108.48 --> 1113.2
that i it wanted it's

1110.88 --> 1115.2
my idea is based on

1113.2 --> 1118.2
mountain bear style

1115.2 --> 1118.2
right

1125.52 --> 1129.52
like if it would it would it's like it's

1128.16 --> 1130.88
got to be

1129.52 --> 1132.96
that ira

1130.88 --> 1135.44
otherwise it would almost be too

1132.96 --> 1135.44
shocking

1138.4 --> 1144.64
anyway hey clutch bear

1140.72 --> 1144.64
messaging i don't have a telegram

1147.36 --> 1153.4399999999998
if clutch if you could pass on the

1150.08 --> 1156.0
message that would be epic

1153.44 --> 1158.88
you know share the show

1156.0 --> 1161.36
share the show i pretty much start start

1158.88 --> 1162.0800000000002
out talking about this

1161.36 --> 1164.4799999999998
so

1162.08 --> 1165.76
it's all in the first part of my show if

1164.48 --> 1167.2
you just

1165.76 --> 1170.16
share this

1167.2 --> 1170.16
this show with him

1170.96 --> 1177.559
preferably after i finished streaming

1173.919 --> 1177.5590000000002
that would be fantastic

1188.799 --> 1191.799
what

1255.84 --> 1258.84
so

1265.84 --> 1268.08
oh

1270.559 --> 1275.12
i got yeah

1272.48 --> 1277.28
i know what to call it

1275.12 --> 1280.2399999999998
i'm gonna title

1277.28 --> 1280.24
this show after it

1280.88 --> 1286.24
you can't handle the gravy

1284.55 --> 1288.32
[Applause]

1286.24 --> 1292.919
yeah

1288.32 --> 1292.9189999999999
that's what that video should be called

1312.96 --> 1318.72
put a black swan in yeah of course dude

1315.28 --> 1320.48
any way to communicate as many

1318.72 --> 1322.799
heavy facts

1320.48 --> 1325.2
in their flat earth relate oh many means

1322.799 --> 1328.08
all about flat earth guys and a lot of

1325.2 --> 1328.0800000000002
his friends are too

1328.48 --> 1330.799
and

1331.2 --> 1338.4
just as many things as you could quickly

1336.08 --> 1340.72
in some way visually and auditorily

1338.4 --> 1341.8400000000001
communicate and funny bits too anything

1340.72 --> 1346.559
that

1341.84 --> 1351.6399999999999
yeah anything that would end onto it

1346.559 --> 1351.6399999999999
like a huge quick flash download

1374.08 --> 1380.1999999999998
right

1375.44 --> 1380.2
anyway that was on my mind

1389.12 --> 1393.36
right also i got uh

1391.84 --> 1395.6
it's kind of funny

1393.36 --> 1398.32
like owen benjamin

1395.6 --> 1401.12
is like on with the eels

1398.32 --> 1403.52
how weird they are

1401.12 --> 1406.8799999999999
and then i basically looked it up on

1403.52 --> 1409.52
youtube some random video about it

1406.88 --> 1413.2
not flat earth related at all

1409.52 --> 1413.2
like some biologists video

1413.28 --> 1417.039
and

1414.799 --> 1419.52
like basically eels are very weird

1417.039 --> 1422.1589999999999
creatures because they

1419.52 --> 1424.4
metamorphize

1422.159 --> 1427.7600000000002
like kind of like butterflies they

1424.4 --> 1431.52
change from one eel type into another

1427.76 --> 1433.279
like uh comparable to axolotls

1431.52 --> 1434.6399999999999
i think i don't know if that's what

1433.279 --> 1436.64
they're called in dutch i don't know if

1434.64 --> 1438.5590000000002
the same name in english

1436.64 --> 1440.4
it's like

1438.559 --> 1442.72
salamanders

1440.4 --> 1445.8400000000001
and they have like a larva stage which

1442.72 --> 1447.679
is like a creature with legs and eyes

1445.84 --> 1450.3999999999999
and everything

1447.679 --> 1452.799
and it looks really weird and then at a

1450.4 --> 1455.2
certain condition they then basically

1452.799 --> 1457.9189999999999
transform into the next final stage

1455.2 --> 1458.799
right well apparently eels have that

1457.919 --> 1461.919
like

1458.799 --> 1464.08
seven forms and they even like radically

1461.919 --> 1466.0800000000002
change color in each form

1464.08 --> 1468.32
they still are pretty much the same

1466.08 --> 1471.36
shaped creature except in the final

1468.32 --> 1473.6
stage when they get much more pronounced

1471.36 --> 1475.9189999999999
faces and

1473.6 --> 1478.32
weird look and they yeah

1475.919 --> 1479.6000000000001
in their last stage they develop

1478.32 --> 1480.48
genitals

1479.6 --> 1482.799
right

1480.48 --> 1486.3600000000001
so they do but they only in the last

1482.799 --> 1486.36
form and apparently

1486.559 --> 1492.48
it's taken a very long long time to even

1489.76 --> 1496.8799999999999
realize that all the separate

1492.48 --> 1499.3600000000001
forms of eels are the same form of eel

1496.88 --> 1501.44
in different stages right people didn't

1499.36 --> 1504.7199999999998
know that didn't understand that

1501.44 --> 1508.24
until at some point somebody

1504.72 --> 1509.44
witnessed a a transformation like a

1508.24 --> 1511.84
pupil

1509.44 --> 1514.48
stage thing and then a totally different

1511.84 --> 1517.76
looking ale right

1514.48 --> 1517.76
it's really bizarre

1519.919 --> 1524.24
but yeah people still don't know how

1521.919 --> 1526.72
they procreate like they know they have

1524.24 --> 1530.159
genitals but they don't do it they never

1526.72 --> 1531.919
do it visibly apparently they all go

1530.159 --> 1535.44
from wherever they are towards the

1531.919 --> 1538.7990000000002
bermuda triangle disappear in there

1535.44 --> 1541.52
and then new micro eels just like spawn

1538.799 --> 1541.52
out in the ground

1541.679 --> 1545.52
or something it's really bizarre

1548.72 --> 1552.72
and so make a yeah oh that's that's

1550.88 --> 1554.88
another one dusty writer that was also

1552.72 --> 1556.48
mentioned in the same video electric

1554.88 --> 1559.8400000000001
eels aren't actually eels they're a

1556.48 --> 1562.159
completely different type of creature

1559.84 --> 1562.1589999999999
yeah

1562.24 --> 1566.0
i don't remember what it was but it is a

1564.0 --> 1567.919
different type of creature

1566.0 --> 1570.96
it's not

1567.919 --> 1572.88
they don't go like through pupil stage

1570.96 --> 1575.6000000000001
they they're not like the eels they're

1572.88 --> 1578.88
not eel family

1575.6 --> 1581.8799999999999
though they have resemblance

1578.88 --> 1581.88
some

1584.96 --> 1587.279
right

1596.88 --> 1602.4
but maybe maybe that is kind of the

1599.279 --> 1602.4
mystery maybe they

1603.76 --> 1607.919
sound kind of bizarre right but if it's

1605.679 --> 1610.88
such a big mystery as to what happens

1607.919 --> 1613.279
like procreating well maybe they do

1610.88 --> 1616.159
procreate and then just kind of like

1613.279 --> 1618.96
bury themselves

1616.159 --> 1621.5200000000002
and then become the nest like it's

1618.96 --> 1623.8400000000001
literally grown out of the eel

1621.52 --> 1625.76
or something

1623.84 --> 1626.8799999999999
that they don't lay eggs like they are

1625.76 --> 1629.039
the eggs

1626.88 --> 1630.3200000000002
and that's why they dig themselves in

1629.039 --> 1632.0
and then

1630.32 --> 1633.9189999999999
micro

1632.0 --> 1635.679
eels come out something like that i

1633.919 --> 1637.919
don't know

1635.679 --> 1640.96
i don't know if anybody knows but that's

1637.919 --> 1643.3600000000001
an idea that i got about it

1640.96 --> 1643.3600000000001
anyway

1647.12 --> 1654.36
what is your response to star trail

1650.96 --> 1654.3600000000001
oh [Â __Â ]

1654.88 --> 1658.3990000000001
what star trail question

1659.039 --> 1664.24
i mean why they

1660.72 --> 1667.1200000000001
seem to turn the other way around when

1664.24 --> 1667.1200000000001
you turn around

1667.36 --> 1669.84
that question

1676.799 --> 1681.36
you mean the question

1678.64 --> 1684.3990000000001
that on a one-way street

1681.36 --> 1688.24
when you stand on one side of the road

1684.399 --> 1690.6399999999999
all the cars go from right to left

1688.24 --> 1692.48
but then if you cross the road

1690.64 --> 1693.6000000000001
and then face the street from the other

1692.48 --> 1696.64
side

1693.6 --> 1699.1999999999998
they go from

1696.64 --> 1701.039
what did i say the other way around

1699.2 --> 1703.6000000000001
right that's

1701.039 --> 1703.6
that's it

1705.44 --> 1709.3600000000001
that's the answer to that question is

1707.6 --> 1711.4399999999998
there is no it's a complete

1709.36 --> 1714.32
misunderstanding i don't know how people

1711.44 --> 1716.88
could stoop that low intellectually

1714.32 --> 1718.399
but like that's

1716.88 --> 1719.5200000000002
things

1718.399 --> 1722.399
average

1719.52 --> 1725.12
three four five years old like

1722.399 --> 1726.9599999999998
don't even have to ask like they just

1725.12 --> 1729.279
figure that out by themselves i don't

1726.96 --> 1732.48
understand how these people can

1729.279 --> 1732.48
dwell on this level of

1736.84 --> 1744.76
stupidity the other side

1741.039 --> 1744.76
other side of what

1761.44 --> 1765.0
oh that's cute

1767.52 --> 1772.48
other side of the equator

1770.24 --> 1774.88
right so yeah that

1772.48 --> 1776.88
the celestials present themselves

1774.88 --> 1778.72
differently there

1776.88 --> 1781.3600000000001
well there is a

1778.72 --> 1784.08
distinct angular relation

1781.36 --> 1788.08
between the celestials and the

1784.08 --> 1788.08
the position on earth so yeah that's

1790.159 --> 1795.0800000000002
i don't see how that proves anything

1792.08 --> 1795.08
though

1798.96 --> 1803.44
it's it's kind of just like a star map

1804.96 --> 1809.3600000000001
like a a grid

1806.72 --> 1812.48
thing to compare it with

1809.36 --> 1814.08
where you are that's it

1812.48 --> 1816.799
it doesn't prove anything about the

1814.08 --> 1816.799
geometry

1817.039 --> 1823.52
and even the celestial demisphere

1820.72 --> 1824.32
some i just call it the sphere

1823.52 --> 1826.1589999999999
like

1824.32 --> 1827.279
there is nothing geometric about it

1826.159 --> 1830.72
either

1827.279 --> 1834.72
because you cannot prove anything

1830.72 --> 1838.3990000000001
about it other than angular relations

1834.72 --> 1838.3990000000001
between it and your position

1839.039 --> 1846.64
it's just an apparent demise fear

1843.2 --> 1849.279
none of it is actual is physical is in a

1846.64 --> 1851.279
specific euclidean position it's all

1849.279 --> 1854.52
just angular

1851.279 --> 1854.52
light manifestations

1868.54 --> 1872.099
[Music]

1886.08 --> 1892.6399999999999
all right there's a very specific logic

1888.64 --> 1894.48
like angular relational logic between

1892.64 --> 1897.2
what you see

1894.48 --> 1899.3600000000001
of the celestial demi sphere

1897.2 --> 1903.279
and your positions

1899.36 --> 1904.08
and like yeah 6 9 0 on the

1903.279 --> 1906.96
way

1904.08 --> 1911.039
down

1906.96 --> 1911.039
to the other side of the land

1911.2 --> 1917.679
on the side of the equator region

1914.399 --> 1918.9599999999998
yeah that might be happening because

1917.679 --> 1922.3990000000001
that's

1918.96 --> 1925.44
how it works there is like a time factor

1922.399 --> 1928.799
but there's also yeah the time position

1925.44 --> 1930.159
it's all bit this derived from the

1928.799 --> 1934.1589999999999
positions

1930.159 --> 1936.72
and then the steadiness between it

1934.159 --> 1938.64
and then how much time passes

1936.72 --> 1940.3990000000001
that there is just like yeah if you go

1938.64 --> 1942.0
to the other side

1940.399 --> 1945.12
i wouldn't be surprised if it's all

1942.0 --> 1946.48
turned upside down because

1945.12 --> 1950.799
that's just

1946.48 --> 1950.799
how the angular deferential is

1954.48 --> 1962.0
it's the logical progression of

1957.84 --> 1965.4399999999998
moving to the other location

1962.0 --> 1965.44
for the celestial angles

1968.0 --> 1971.88
hey seeking star water

1977.44 --> 1981.24
right anything else

2019.2 --> 2025.3600000000001
hello jason mccormack

2022.08 --> 2028.0
yeah no no we don't live inside of a

2025.36 --> 2030.6399999999999
geometric physical sphere not

2028.0 --> 2030.64
no we don't

2031.679 --> 2035.919
just as the globers think they're on a

2033.679 --> 2037.76
ball you can think that you're inside of

2035.919 --> 2039.76
a sphere

2037.76 --> 2043.36
but you're not

2039.76 --> 2046.96
not a geometric one anyway

2043.36 --> 2050.0
right what the special limitations are

2046.96 --> 2052.7200000000003
might be spherical but the orientation

2050.0 --> 2054.8
of the of the surface is definitely not

2052.72 --> 2056.48
spherical

2054.8 --> 2059.8790000000004
inverse

2056.48 --> 2059.879
or otherwise

2077.76 --> 2082.32
do i have

2080.32 --> 2084.3990000000003
okay

2082.32 --> 2087.119
to choose an even more disturbing

2084.399 --> 2088.6389999999997
picture for your icon

2087.119 --> 2091.119
we owe w

2088.639 --> 2091.119
we ob

2095.679 --> 2100.96
do i have a discord yeah technically i

2098.16 --> 2104.48
do it's just kind of non-active there's

2100.96 --> 2104.48
literally nothing happening there

2104.64 --> 2109.1189999999997
it was kind of like a back-up plan thing

2107.76 --> 2111.599
but

2109.119 --> 2113.599
it's still there i might at some point

2111.599 --> 2116.92
do something it's just it's not the

2113.599 --> 2116.92
right time

2119.39 --> 2122.469
[Music]

2146.079 --> 2148.4
huh

2149.839 --> 2153.52
oh mitchell from australia

2153.76 --> 2157.8
did he just go live

2158.079 --> 2163.52
oh no i just uploaded it

2160.96 --> 2167.52
now what's les what i just got a pop-up

2163.52 --> 2169.359
from freaking 16 hours ago that's lame

2167.52 --> 2172.7599999999998
uh

2169.359 --> 2172.7599999999998
thanks youtube

2179.04 --> 2184.2799999999997
right

2180.88 --> 2184.28
so anyway

2195.04 --> 2201.839
yesterday

2196.8 --> 2201.8390000000004
roommate came by with her dad this time

2201.92 --> 2204.56
pretty cool

2209.599 --> 2214.3500000000004
she has

2211.28 --> 2215.52
good parents i think

2214.35 --> 2217.7599999999998
[Music]

2215.52 --> 2219.92
oh god it's just

2217.76 --> 2219.92
yeah

2220.079 --> 2224.1600000000003
i yeah

2221.599 --> 2229.0
didn't get all jittery this time the

2224.16 --> 2229.0
initial shock was over but

2229.359 --> 2232.7999999999997
i really like this one

2236.24 --> 2240.0789999999997
and

2237.52 --> 2240.079
i don't know

2241.76 --> 2245.119
the weirdest thing about the whole thing

2243.28 --> 2248.0
is i kind of feel

2245.119 --> 2250.32
in place with these people

2248.0 --> 2252.079
right i feel comfortable being there and

2250.32 --> 2255.3590000000004
helping out they feel comfortable

2252.079 --> 2259.28
talking to me there's no awkwardness

2255.359 --> 2259.2799999999997
is just like i feel like

2262.4 --> 2264.64
well

2267.92 --> 2271.56
it's very invigorating

2285.92 --> 2290.56
what

2287.52 --> 2292.64
the world is under a hex

2290.56 --> 2297.16
hexagram

2292.64 --> 2297.16
contains xx really

2304.079 --> 2306.32
well

2313.359 --> 2319.5989999999997
that there's many crossover points but

2315.839 --> 2319.599
isn't that kind of like the point

2321.92 --> 2324.92
what

2361.359 --> 2363.5989999999997
uh

2365.28 --> 2368.96
yeah clutch where can i

2367.04 --> 2371.359
address you again

2368.96 --> 2374.96
do you have

2371.359 --> 2377.2799999999997
like mountain bears instagram was it

2374.96 --> 2379.68
like i i just like if you're not

2377.28 --> 2382.7200000000003
literally just gonna share

2379.68 --> 2384.72
my show link

2382.72 --> 2388.56
with him directly then at least like

2384.72 --> 2388.56
give me a link so that i can do it

2392.96 --> 2398.16
market just

2395.68 --> 2401.96
google instagram and then find his name

2398.16 --> 2401.96
myself of course

2416.24 --> 2420.9199999999996
oh goody you have to log in

2433.92 --> 2436.92
foreign

2447.68 --> 2451.68
oh he has snowbirds he likes to bring up

2449.92 --> 2452.96
the focal pendulum

2451.68 --> 2456.64
well

2452.96 --> 2456.64
maybe you should spell it differently

2463.28 --> 2469.92
i think that's a better way to

2467.44 --> 2469.92
do it

2471.599 --> 2475.6800000000003
but yeah you can tell him about the

2473.44 --> 2479.599
focal pendulum that the only thing it

2475.68 --> 2482.319
only it literally the only thing it does

2479.599 --> 2484.88
is swing back and forth and then

2482.319 --> 2486.16
you imagine how the earth is spinning

2484.88 --> 2488.0
underneath it

2486.16 --> 2491.1189999999997
nothing is actually happening it's

2488.0 --> 2494.56
literally a hypnotizing device

2491.119 --> 2496.56
a pendulum swinging back and forth

2494.56 --> 2498.48
and then as part of the setup you

2496.56 --> 2500.96
imagine how the earth is spinning

2498.48 --> 2501.839
underneath that's it

2500.96 --> 2504.079
it's

2501.839 --> 2507.56
a mind experiment it's not actually a

2504.079 --> 2507.5600000000004
physics experiment

2514.88 --> 2519.52
oh that would be great clutch bear

2517.76 --> 2522.4
i know you don't know them but you're at

2519.52 --> 2525.359
least more connected to that yeah to the

2522.4 --> 2525.359
the bear network

2527.119 --> 2534.1600000000003
i personally i i'm just here on youtube

2530.0 --> 2534.16
well also on d live that's it

2535.44 --> 2540.4
i'm not really out there and connected

2538.0 --> 2543.28
to like all these platforms out there

2540.4 --> 2543.28
it's just too much

2546.24 --> 2549.8799999999997
at least for now

2554.24 --> 2558.4799999999996
haven't the pendulus used be found to be

2556.72 --> 2560.16
powered well start seeking star wars

2558.48 --> 2562.48
it's funny

2560.16 --> 2564.8799999999997
because even if they were

2562.48 --> 2567.359
it wouldn't matter it nothing is

2564.88 --> 2567.359
happening

2570.56 --> 2574.64
it doesn't matter whether it just

2572.24 --> 2576.24
naturally swings or if there's some

2574.64 --> 2579.04
powered swing

2576.24 --> 2581.68
it's just a pendulum it doesn't do

2579.04 --> 2584.56
anything the whole point is to just

2581.68 --> 2586.64
watch at it get distracted and

2584.56 --> 2588.72
hypnotized and then imagine how the

2586.64 --> 2590.48
earth is spinning underneath

2588.72 --> 2592.48
that's it

2590.48 --> 2595.56
doesn't do anything whether it's powered

2592.48 --> 2595.56
or not

2631.599 --> 2636.48
yeah that's the whole point isn't it

2633.28 --> 2636.48
classical homeopath

2639.44 --> 2643.96
that's the ball religion in a nutshell

2665.44 --> 2668.44
um

2702.72 --> 2705.72
hey

2706.64 --> 2714.319
a cavendish 9.8 meters per second

2711.76 --> 2714.3190000000004
per second

2715.64 --> 2718.77
[Music]

2731.04 --> 2735.25
oh god

2733.44 --> 2738.469
i think we've got a squirter in chat

2735.25 --> 2738.469
[Music]

2745.44 --> 2749.68
so mostly ghostly

2747.839 --> 2752.56
it is really cute

2749.68 --> 2752.56
what did he prove

2754.56 --> 2761.04
what what does 15 degree drift

2758.0 --> 2763.2
from a ring laser gyroscope proof mostly

2761.04 --> 2766.88
ghostly

2763.2 --> 2769.68
when the other gyroscopes didn't

2766.88 --> 2771.839
right regular physical mechanical

2769.68 --> 2773.1189999999997
gyroscope didn't do that

2771.839 --> 2775.839
so what

2773.119 --> 2778.88
does 15 degrees

2775.839 --> 2782.0
per hour drift from a ring laser

2778.88 --> 2782.0
gyroscope proof

2782.079 --> 2785.079
wow

2792.16 --> 2797.96
you got some white noise

2794.319 --> 2797.96
in there don't you

2803.359 --> 2811.04
because when i asked the question

2806.16 --> 2815.04
i added some facts some confirmed facts

2811.04 --> 2818.88
that accompany that piece of data

2815.04 --> 2821.2799999999997
that the ring laser gyroscope drifted 15

2818.88 --> 2825.44
degrees an hour

2821.28 --> 2826.4
yeah i added some facts to that

2825.44 --> 2830.2400000000002
yet

2826.4 --> 2831.04
you just state earth rotation

2830.24 --> 2832.8799999999997
but

2831.04 --> 2834.079
if the earth was

2832.88 --> 2837.52
the cause

2834.079 --> 2840.7200000000003
for the ring laser gyroscope to drift

2837.52 --> 2844.48
then why didn't the regular mechanical

2840.72 --> 2847.9199999999996
gyroscope drift

2844.48 --> 2850.96
and also yeah why don't

2847.92 --> 2854.48
drones and airplanes and helicopters

2850.96 --> 2854.48
in the sky drift

2854.96 --> 2859.839
because if the earth was actually

2857.2 --> 2859.839
turning

2861.28 --> 2867.0400000000004
underneath everything well gases don't

2864.64 --> 2868.72
have momentum

2867.04 --> 2871.44
they're not susceptible

2868.72 --> 2872.7999999999997
they only respond to local air pressure

2871.44 --> 2876.8
differential

2872.8 --> 2877.6800000000003
container based by the way let's just

2876.8 --> 2880.48
not

2877.68 --> 2882.24
involve that part for a second

2880.48 --> 2885.119
right

2882.24 --> 2887.2
gases only respond to local air pressure

2885.119 --> 2888.2400000000002
differential not

2887.2 --> 2890.24
to

2888.24 --> 2893.2
momentum

2890.24 --> 2894.64
you can push against gas

2893.2 --> 2896.0789999999997
like the air

2894.64 --> 2897.7599999999998
and it will just

2896.079 --> 2899.8390000000004
respond to the local air pressure

2897.76 --> 2902.0
difference you immediately move crawl

2899.839 --> 2903.52
around it and stabilize again with its

2902.0 --> 2905.28
surrounding

2903.52 --> 2906.24
that's it

2905.28 --> 2909.8390000000004
right

2906.24 --> 2913.68
in order for gas to be carried with

2909.839 --> 2916.0789999999997
other things like water

2913.68 --> 2918.7999999999997
stone which are susceptible by momentum

2916.079 --> 2922.559
right you can throw a glob of water it

2918.8 --> 2924.88
will continue the ark

2922.559 --> 2926.4
when you throw it and just like with the

2924.88 --> 2929.119
stone

2926.4 --> 2930.4
gas doesn't do that

2929.119 --> 2932.559
it halts

2930.4 --> 2935.119
immediately and immediately finds

2932.559 --> 2936.96
equilibrium in gas pressure differential

2935.119 --> 2939.52
with its surrounding that's what gases

2936.96 --> 2943.52
do unless they are all

2939.52 --> 2945.68
sealed contained with a physical object

2943.52 --> 2946.96
can be liquid

2945.68 --> 2949.2
and then

2946.96 --> 2950.4
the momentum from the physical object

2949.2 --> 2951.5989999999997
might

2950.4 --> 2954.319
drag

2951.599 --> 2956.48
the gas contained within with it

2954.319 --> 2958.48
but if that's not there

2956.48 --> 2960.0
it's not going to be dragged

2958.48 --> 2962.72
gases

2960.0 --> 2964.16
always slow things down so if the earth

2962.72 --> 2966.48
is rotating

2964.16 --> 2968.64
underneath all that gas of the

2966.48 --> 2970.559
atmosphere the gas is going to be

2968.64 --> 2972.319
standing still

2970.559 --> 2974.88
and that means that anything that is

2972.319 --> 2977.68
suspended within that gas like a drone a

2974.88 --> 2979.119
helicopter an airplane

2977.68 --> 2981.7599999999998
like even though they might be

2979.119 --> 2983.6800000000003
propelling themselves within the gases

2981.76 --> 2986.88
basically creating local air pressure

2983.68 --> 2990.0789999999997
differentials which thrusts them forward

2986.88 --> 2991.92
within the body of gas

2990.079 --> 2993.76
the overall body of gas is still going

2991.92 --> 2995.359
to be stationary

2993.76 --> 2997.119
while the earth is spinning underneath

2995.359 --> 2999.359
so that means that everything is going

2997.119 --> 3000.4
to drift within the air

2999.359 --> 3001.359
right

3000.4 --> 3003.359
so

3001.359 --> 3004.16
does that happen

3003.359 --> 3006.0789999999997
does

3004.16 --> 3008.5589999999997
everything drift

3006.079 --> 3010.319
because the earth is turning underneath

3008.559 --> 3011.6800000000003
which is what you

3010.319 --> 3013.52
claim

3011.68 --> 3017.1189999999997
when you say that

3013.52 --> 3019.599
bob nodell's ring laser gyroscope 15

3017.119 --> 3022.599
degrees per hour drift prove the earth

3019.599 --> 3022.599
rotates

3040.88 --> 3044.7200000000003
he never stayed at earth rotation

3045.92 --> 3051.28
i was talking to mostly ghostly here but

3048.72 --> 3053.4399999999996
yeah of course bob didn't claim that

3051.28 --> 3055.44
it's just anti-flat earthers being a

3053.44 --> 3057.2000000000003
dick

3055.44 --> 3058.4
but i like to

3057.2 --> 3060.5589999999997
just

3058.4 --> 3063.28
take it serious

3060.559 --> 3063.28
because i can

3065.76 --> 3071.6800000000003
and then yeah they mostly ghostly can

3069.28 --> 3073.76
blank this all out in his mind he can

3071.68 --> 3076.3999999999996
all white noises basically not listen to

3073.76 --> 3077.5200000000004
a word i say that's okay

3076.4 --> 3080.1600000000003
because

3077.52 --> 3084.8
other people don't have to do that they

3080.16 --> 3084.7999999999997
can actually listen and learn

3085.04 --> 3090.5589999999997
right

3086.079 --> 3093.2000000000003
mostly ghostly you cannot prevent others

3090.559 --> 3095.52
from figuring out how it actually works

3093.2 --> 3097.9199999999996
even though you're blanking everything

3095.52 --> 3101.2
out in your mind in order to not catch

3097.92 --> 3104.48
on to the reality of things

3101.2 --> 3107.2
but you can't make other people do that

3104.48 --> 3107.2
you understand

3107.28 --> 3111.44
you can only reinforce your own

3109.44 --> 3114.8
ignorance you can't do that with other

3111.44 --> 3117.2000000000003
people it doesn't work that way

3114.8 --> 3119.52
it's only for the willing ignorance is

3117.2 --> 3121.2
only for the willing

3119.52 --> 3124.4
it's

3121.2 --> 3126.96
an antecedent ignorance requires

3124.4 --> 3126.96
willingness

3128.48 --> 3135.68
occulting information in your mind

3131.2 --> 3137.2799999999997
blanking it out white noise it requires

3135.68 --> 3141.44
willingness

3137.28 --> 3141.44
you cannot force that on anybody

3142.0 --> 3146.72
you might trick them into it with fear

3144.88 --> 3150.1600000000003
porn and [Â __Â ] by lowering their

3146.72 --> 3153.4399999999996
frequency so they lose all that energy

3150.16 --> 3155.52
that helps them attain oversight because

3153.44 --> 3157.76
that takes energy it takes a certain

3155.52 --> 3160.8
level of tension

3157.76 --> 3162.96
and if you're constantly in fear or

3160.8 --> 3165.2000000000003
you're squirting with porn and [Â __Â ] yeah

3162.96 --> 3167.2
you're not gonna

3165.2 --> 3170.64
really get it that much

3167.2 --> 3170.64
i'm gonna be distracted a lot

3175.04 --> 3181.24
why did he want to hide

3177.359 --> 3181.24
how did he hide it

3185.839 --> 3190.96
and why

3187.359 --> 3193.2799999999997
is bob wanting to hide the 15 degree

3190.96 --> 3195.92
drift relevant in the face of everything

3193.28 --> 3199.8390000000004
i just explained

3195.92 --> 3203.44
like what does it matter what bob does

3199.839 --> 3205.599
with the data he attained

3203.44 --> 3207.44
what he might have impulsively done with

3205.599 --> 3210.2400000000002
it at first

3207.44 --> 3211.839
when because he probably didn't expect

3210.24 --> 3213.2
that to happen

3211.839 --> 3214.5589999999997
when it did

3213.2 --> 3218.0
and then he might have reacted

3214.559 --> 3219.599
impulsively well it's only human right

3218.0 --> 3220.96
sometimes we don't know what to do with

3219.599 --> 3222.48
the data that

3220.96 --> 3223.76
falls in our lap

3222.48 --> 3225.92
especially when it's not what we

3223.76 --> 3228.6400000000003
expected so

3225.92 --> 3231.839
yeah he might have tried to hide it

3228.64 --> 3233.359
does that matter to anything

3231.839 --> 3234.24
does that

3233.359 --> 3238.4
make

3234.24 --> 3239.5989999999997
the earth actually rotate

3238.4 --> 3241.92
underneath

3239.599 --> 3243.76
the ring laser gyroscope causing it to

3241.92 --> 3245.359
drift

3243.76 --> 3248.079
no

3245.359 --> 3248.0789999999997
no it doesn't

3248.8 --> 3253.76
what people's characters are

3251.599 --> 3257.599
don't matter

3253.76 --> 3259.92
to how the mechanics of this realm work

3257.599 --> 3261.2000000000003
it doesn't matter so you can distract

3259.92 --> 3262.559
the way to

3261.2 --> 3264.7999999999997
add home

3262.559 --> 3266.88
details all you like

3264.8 --> 3269.04
it doesn't help it doesn't help your

3266.88 --> 3272.48
argument it's only distraction and

3269.04 --> 3274.64
everybody knows that [Â __Â ] by now

3272.48 --> 3277.76
right again

3274.64 --> 3280.319
only the willing ignorant

3277.76 --> 3281.6800000000003
willingly ignorant would fall for such a

3280.319 --> 3283.119
thing

3281.68 --> 3284.8799999999997
and

3283.119 --> 3286.88
yeah

3284.88 --> 3288.96
i'm not willing

3286.88 --> 3290.96
and a lot of others in here are also not

3288.96 --> 3293.839
willing and they will never be convinced

3290.96 --> 3296.16
to do that they might give up like hope

3293.839 --> 3299.359
temporarily and just like

3296.16 --> 3301.839
need to step away or something

3299.359 --> 3303.68
but they'll get back

3301.839 --> 3305.599
or maybe they'll not get back and

3303.68 --> 3307.2799999999997
they'll stick to focusing to something

3305.599 --> 3310.4
else in their life but they will never

3307.28 --> 3313.3590000000004
become willingly ignorant like you

3310.4 --> 3314.799
so in the end you're only

3313.359 --> 3316.96
convincing

3314.799 --> 3318.88
yourself

3316.96 --> 3321.839
that's the only one you're actually

3318.88 --> 3321.839
convincing

3328.16 --> 3332.319
trickery

3329.52 --> 3332.319
oh my god

3332.4 --> 3337.839
i'm so triggered that's amazing

3335.839 --> 3340.72
i mean

3337.839 --> 3342.16
this was only the calm calmest

3340.72 --> 3345.2799999999997
explanation

3342.16 --> 3346.96
about this mechanic that i've ever given

3345.28 --> 3349.2000000000003
on the show probably

3346.96 --> 3351.04
but i'm really triggered by the 15

3349.2 --> 3353.2
degrees guys

3351.04 --> 3354.079
did you hear how triggered i was over

3353.2 --> 3357.1189999999997
this

3354.079 --> 3357.119
isn't that incredible

3359.76 --> 3364.4
i think maybe it's just uh projecting a

3363.119 --> 3367.839
little

3364.4 --> 3369.359
i know you gotta do something to fill

3367.839 --> 3372.4
up

3369.359 --> 3375.839
the white noise right you gotta

3372.4 --> 3378.2400000000002
at least pretend like you have a point

3375.839 --> 3380.16
somewhere

3378.24 --> 3382.64
because i know the white noise you just

3380.16 --> 3384.5589999999997
don't hear anything but yeah still all

3382.64 --> 3387.2
that time passes

3384.559 --> 3390.559
you gotta give some excuse as to some

3387.2 --> 3393.7599999999998
activity that prove you have an inch

3390.559 --> 3393.76
of thinking ability

3394.96 --> 3401.52
you have anything at all

3397.04 --> 3401.52
not just white noise willing ignorance

3402.88 --> 3408.96
so maybe pretending like i'm not

3406.559 --> 3411.52
entirely emotionally stable within the

3408.96 --> 3411.52
argument

3412.88 --> 3417.52
maybe that's a good thing to bring up

3415.2 --> 3419.7599999999998
because

3417.52 --> 3422.0
i didn't yeah i don't know why double

3419.76 --> 3424.559
thinkers do what they do but i am not

3422.0 --> 3426.799
triggered right now i'm the least

3424.559 --> 3429.0400000000004
triggered i've probably ever been on the

3426.799 --> 3429.04
show

3430.96 --> 3435.76
like i'm not even triggered enough to be

3433.119 --> 3439.2000000000003
laughing about it

3435.76 --> 3439.2000000000003
okay now i have whatever

3443.68 --> 3447.44
bob's not a flatter

3445.599 --> 3449.839
well you can think

3447.44 --> 3452.7200000000003
bob's not a flat earther

3449.839 --> 3454.4
but if you're gonna ask him i'm pretty

3452.72 --> 3456.5589999999997
sure he's gonna tell you the earth's not

3454.4 --> 3458.839
a globe

3456.559 --> 3461.8390000000004
right but

3458.839 --> 3463.52
yeah when you have all this white noise

3461.839 --> 3465.68
all this willing ignorance you gotta

3463.52 --> 3468.48
fill it up with something right so maybe

3465.68 --> 3470.319
just try to reverse engineer

3468.48 --> 3473.28
all the flat earthers out there that

3470.319 --> 3476.079
have crushed your dream constantly

3473.28 --> 3478.7200000000003
and then try to reverse them inside out

3476.079 --> 3480.6400000000003
like they are the globe or champions and

3478.72 --> 3482.9599999999996
then you build a

3480.64 --> 3484.319
a pantheon inside of your mind to feel

3482.96 --> 3485.839
all that white knowledge right you got

3484.319 --> 3487.44
to fill it up with something it's so

3485.839 --> 3491.2
much these days

3487.44 --> 3491.2000000000003
maybe you have like five percent

3491.68 --> 3495.9199999999996
left

3493.2 --> 3497.68
of room to actually absorb new data

3495.92 --> 3500.319
there's still white noise for you and d

3497.68 --> 3502.3999999999996
flat earth so if you want to create this

3500.319 --> 3505.04
pantheon of

3502.4 --> 3507.6800000000003
inside out flat earthers that are

3505.04 --> 3510.64
supposedly globe champions to try to

3507.68 --> 3514.64
spiritually mock us by creating this

3510.64 --> 3517.359
internal pantheon of inside out world

3514.64 --> 3519.5989999999997
of all the perpetrators that have broken

3517.359 --> 3524.319
your dream that you're unable to

3519.599 --> 3526.4
overcome that you chose the devil for

3524.319 --> 3528.72
right to help you out because you

3526.4 --> 3531.839
couldn't get over it

3528.72 --> 3534.72
so you chose lies you chose white noise

3531.839 --> 3536.0789999999997
you chose willing ignorance the devil

3534.72 --> 3539.2
satan

3536.079 --> 3541.8390000000004
that's what it is lies satan is lies

3539.2 --> 3543.52
that's what you chose for it

3541.839 --> 3546.4
so you got to fill it up with something

3543.52 --> 3550.16
right so why not create inside out

3546.4 --> 3554.079
spiritual icons of those that

3550.16 --> 3555.7599999999998
made you in your mind choose the devil

3554.079 --> 3559.48
to fight us

3555.76 --> 3563.119
right that's the level of extreme

3559.48 --> 3565.44
extreme desperation

3563.119 --> 3566.599
that flantai flat earthers actually have

3565.44 --> 3568.4
inside of them

3566.599 --> 3571.6800000000003
extreme

3568.4 --> 3574.559
desperation you cannot imagine

3571.68 --> 3574.5589999999997
unless you're there

3575.599 --> 3579.3590000000004
it's so

3576.96 --> 3582.799
extreme that they

3579.359 --> 3584.72
regularly hallucinate because of it

3582.799 --> 3588.559
that's what happens when you

3584.72 --> 3591.9199999999996
white noise a lot of things

3588.559 --> 3591.92
you start to hallucinate

3598.079 --> 3601.8390000000004
and then you start to act like a demon

3600.24 --> 3603.7599999999998
and then afterwards you don't remember

3601.839 --> 3604.96
and then even though it's recorded right

3603.76 --> 3606.48
on

3604.96 --> 3609.28
a live show

3606.48 --> 3611.04
you will still say no that didn't happen

3609.28 --> 3614.079
because you weren't there

3611.04 --> 3616.5589999999997
you were so gone you were literally

3614.079 --> 3618.559
triggered possessed little demon at the

3616.559 --> 3621.92
time and that's not you you don't even

3618.559 --> 3624.7200000000003
recognize that as you

3621.92 --> 3627.28
but that was in you

3624.72 --> 3629.359
that took you over though

3627.28 --> 3632.079
it possessed you

3629.359 --> 3635.52
that demonic spirit

3632.079 --> 3635.52
that knows no shame

3636.4 --> 3640.48
right

3638.48 --> 3644.4
you invited it in

3640.48 --> 3647.04
because you want the lies and the demons

3644.4 --> 3649.839
to protect you

3647.04 --> 3652.24
from ascension from overcoming the

3649.839 --> 3654.319
things you can't get over

3652.24 --> 3656.799
the reality the confrontation with

3654.319 --> 3659.2
reality of certain things you can't you

3656.799 --> 3663.52
don't want to you could probably you

3659.2 --> 3665.9199999999996
don't want to do that so you choose lies

3663.52 --> 3667.7599999999998
with lies comes a whole set of

3665.92 --> 3671.319
consequences

3667.76 --> 3671.3190000000004
demonic vulnerability

3671.44 --> 3674.96
and that's what's going to happen that

3673.119 --> 3678.079
is what is happening

3674.96 --> 3678.079
to a lot of you

3678.72 --> 3684.0
right now

3680.16 --> 3687.52
has been happening for a while i'm just

3684.0 --> 3689.359
showing you exactly what's going on

3687.52 --> 3692.559
inside of you

3689.359 --> 3694.88
and i know because i was there

3692.559 --> 3698.0
i didn't let it slip that far i didn't

3694.88 --> 3699.28
double down on stupidity but i wanted to

3698.0 --> 3701.2
understand it

3699.28 --> 3703.0400000000004
i wanted to understand how willing

3701.2 --> 3706.2
ignorance actually works what that does

3703.04 --> 3706.2
to you

3726.48 --> 3729.839
flat tumor fest what

3736.319 --> 3741.839
what's wrong with that sks

3739.119 --> 3743.359
isn't the whole point of the

3741.839 --> 3744.64
lockdown [Â __Â ]

3743.359 --> 3746.88
and all that

3744.64 --> 3749.44
but you're not supposed to come together

3746.88 --> 3751.6800000000003
have a fun time with a lot of people in

3749.44 --> 3753.839
the same place

3751.68 --> 3757.2
what's wrong with doing that

3753.839 --> 3759.599
wow all this madden no the whole point

3757.2 --> 3762.16
is to not

3759.599 --> 3765.119
give in to the madness by just doing

3762.16 --> 3769.3999999999996
that by actually having

3765.119 --> 3769.4
meetups and having fun

3769.599 --> 3773.44
hey

3771.839 --> 3775.2799999999997
is that you dell

3773.44 --> 3777.52
is that the real you

3775.28 --> 3777.52
cool

3779.92 --> 3787.039
what's the topic today of uh

3784.0 --> 3787.039
it's all over the place

3795.119 --> 3799.76
currently talking about uh

3797.92 --> 3803.2000000000003
little anti-flat earther trolls and

3799.76 --> 3806.559
their 50 degrees per hour claim

3803.2 --> 3810.48
and the focal pendulum

3806.559 --> 3813.039
and yeah i laid out a bit of

3810.48 --> 3816.64
well psychology spirit psychology and

3813.039 --> 3821.2400000000002
the mechanics of yeah how ignorance work

3816.64 --> 3821.24
so that's been the subject mainly

3825.61 --> 3828.789
[Music]

3831.52 --> 3835.92
you're rattling on about gyroscope drift

3834.0 --> 3839.2
well it's funnier than that

3835.92 --> 3842.0
you know because it's not gyroscope it's

3839.2 --> 3843.4399999999996
only the ring laser gyroscope so the

3842.0 --> 3847.2
light

3843.44 --> 3849.52
mechanism drifted the light drifted

3847.2 --> 3851.2799999999997
the mechanical gyroscope

3849.52 --> 3854.16
didn't drift

3851.28 --> 3856.48
it was only one of them one of the three

3854.16 --> 3858.24
types of gyroscopes that they had

3856.48 --> 3860.0
drifted

3858.24 --> 3862.319
but

3860.0 --> 3864.48
clovers just don't listen they blood

3862.319 --> 3867.599
they black it all out they have white

3864.48 --> 3868.4
noise they don't hear the rest of it

3867.599 --> 3869.839
like

3868.4 --> 3872.2400000000002
they only hear the part where they say

3869.839 --> 3874.16
yeah the ring laser gyroscope drifted

3872.24 --> 3877.1189999999997
and then as soon as that

3874.16 --> 3877.1189999999997
sentence is finished

3877.52 --> 3880.96
they don't hear anything else they don't

3879.44 --> 3883.359
hear how i mentioned that the other

3880.96 --> 3886.2400000000002
types of gyroscopes don't drift and that

3883.359 --> 3888.0
if there was actual drift and that was

3886.24 --> 3890.0789999999997
the cause

3888.0 --> 3892.839
like caused by the earth spinning

3890.079 --> 3895.28
underneath that there would be endless

3892.839 --> 3897.359
consequences because of gas not being

3895.28 --> 3899.599
susceptible to momentum only responding

3897.359 --> 3901.68
to local air pressure differential

3899.599 --> 3904.96
and how everything would be drifting and

3901.68 --> 3907.839
you can't figure a way out around that

3904.96 --> 3912.0
like the whole idea that lockstep motion

3907.839 --> 3914.16
with air is absolutely mathematical and

3912.0 --> 3916.64
physically impossible

3914.16 --> 3919.7599999999998
and i explained this to no end in such a

3916.64 --> 3921.44
detail but they just hear

3919.76 --> 3923.76
you being a flat earther you just say

3921.44 --> 3927.599
yeah yeah the ring laser gyroscope

3923.76 --> 3927.599
drifted and after that point it's just

3928.4 --> 3933.28
10 minutes 15 minutes straight and the

3931.44 --> 3935.599
next thing they'll say they'll just say

3933.28 --> 3938.799
it right over again because they didn't

3935.599 --> 3938.799
hear it because they heard

3939.28 --> 3943.48
nothing

3940.16 --> 3943.48
white noise

3950.079 --> 3955.76
ah the global discernment is the only

3952.24 --> 3955.7599999999998
thing drifting well said hey you

3973.68 --> 3979.359
they absolutely they love being ignorant

3975.68 --> 3980.72
but ignorance is bliss though

3979.359 --> 3982.88
until you

3980.72 --> 3983.68
find yourself in hell

3982.88 --> 3986.319
right

3983.68 --> 3989.359
ignorance is bliss

3986.319 --> 3990.72
but it will make you drift down and slip

3989.359 --> 3992.4
down

3990.72 --> 3994.16
it's always going to happen because if

3992.4 --> 3995.76
you're ignorant then you're not paying

3994.16 --> 3998.96
attention

3995.76 --> 4000.96
to things you need to understand

3998.96 --> 4002.68
for your own well-being for your own

4000.96 --> 4005.039
spiritual well-being for your own

4002.68 --> 4007.44
decision-making processes

4005.039 --> 4011.28
if you are ignorant you ignore

4007.44 --> 4011.28
things that you need

4011.359 --> 4015.92
to develop yourself

4013.359 --> 4017.92
so ignorance is bliss at the time

4015.92 --> 4021.2000000000003
but after a while you'll find that

4017.92 --> 4022.2400000000002
you've actually made sacrifices because

4021.2 --> 4024.8799999999997
of it

4022.24 --> 4024.8799999999997
that happens

4026.0 --> 4028.24
right

4028.64 --> 4033.2799999999997
and that's the punishment of god that's

4030.88 --> 4036.0
and you can't even just say oh this i

4033.28 --> 4039.2000000000003
did this so this happened no it's energy

4036.0 --> 4040.4
it is the entire transformation process

4039.2 --> 4042.3999999999996
of you

4040.4 --> 4043.2000000000003
and how you are how you think how you

4042.4 --> 4044.96
feel

4043.2 --> 4047.359
it's too complicated to just

4044.96 --> 4051.44
esoterically pin it down to

4047.359 --> 4053.68
one thing one consequence no

4051.44 --> 4056.64
it's more esoteric than that

4053.68 --> 4056.64
hey what did you do

4057.839 --> 4061.2799999999997
no don't block him

4061.599 --> 4065.039
oh no no that's not

4070.0 --> 4073.0
right

4077.44 --> 4083.039
fat finger oh okay okay it was by

4079.599 --> 4083.039
accident that's that's okay

4084.88 --> 4090.0
it's like kind of shocking you hiding

4086.88 --> 4091.2000000000003
somebody must have been terrible

4090.0 --> 4093.68
but yeah i

4091.2 --> 4096.719
can see that

4093.68 --> 4099.599999999999
can't we see that it is the stars

4096.719 --> 4102.96
drifting with the drone recording star

4099.6 --> 4105.04
trails from inertial reference frame

4102.96 --> 4107.359
yeah that didn't really seem ban worthy

4105.04 --> 4107.359
to me

4109.44 --> 4111.759
all right

4114.56 --> 4118.52
all right be back two minutes

4123.199 --> 4126.199
so

4213.12 --> 4216.12
you

4238.88 --> 4242.4400000000005
yeah good one

4247.84 --> 4251.84
yeah

4249.6 --> 4254.719
that's right yeah gyroscope data is

4251.84 --> 4257.1990000000005
extremely eucalydian

4254.719 --> 4259.92
like the gyroscope might be the only

4257.199 --> 4262.879999999999
thing that can actually help

4259.92 --> 4265.36
out to map out the potentially spatial

4262.88 --> 4268.32
non-linear realm

4265.36 --> 4269.759999999999
because it is euclidean no matter what

4268.32 --> 4273.199
now

4269.76 --> 4275.52
there could be fascinating anomalies

4273.199 --> 4276.48
coming from it though

4275.52 --> 4278.88
right

4276.48 --> 4280.639999999999
what would happen

4278.88 --> 4283.4400000000005
when

4280.64 --> 4284.8
euclidean

4283.44 --> 4286.5599999999995
like

4284.8 --> 4290.159000000001
let's just say you go around in the ring

4286.56 --> 4290.159000000001
you have the gyroscope right

4290.48 --> 4296.879999999999
all right do this

4292.8 --> 4296.88
yes it's going to be tough to show

4297.28 --> 4303.5199999999995
you're going around the earth around

4300.56 --> 4306.080000000001
let's just presume a disk

4303.52 --> 4308.64
and then the gyroscope yeah it stays in

4306.08 --> 4311.28
its euclidean orientation

4308.64 --> 4312.4800000000005
but what if you then return in the

4311.28 --> 4315.84
circle

4312.48 --> 4315.839999999999
and it's off

4317.92 --> 4320.2390000000005
right

4318.88 --> 4322.64
that would mean

4320.239 --> 4324.4
that space is not entirely linear that

4322.64 --> 4327.6
would mean that

4324.4 --> 4330.4
by following the path in which is

4327.6 --> 4332.159000000001
euclidean a circle it doesn't close up

4330.4 --> 4334.08
properly

4332.159 --> 4337.04
right that would be a sign of spatial

4334.08 --> 4337.04
non-linearity

4339.52 --> 4346.88
gyroscopes going to be critical critical

4343.84 --> 4346.88
to figure it out

4347.04 --> 4352.8
if there is special non-linearity

4350.32 --> 4356.36
present within the design the setup of

4352.8 --> 4356.360000000001
this realm layout

4363.6 --> 4366.6
ah

4376.4 --> 4380.879999999999
nobody uses curved datum lines what

4381.28 --> 4385.84
no yeah that's right they don't do that

4388.4 --> 4394.879999999999
nothing goes to outer space well outer

4390.159 --> 4394.879999999999
space is just a conceptual idea based on

4395.04 --> 4401.12
imagining how the gradation division of

4397.92 --> 4401.92
gases within the confined realm

4401.12 --> 4405.5199999999995
would

4401.92 --> 4405.52
go on forever it's like

4405.6 --> 4411.679
you have a box you have a stat and then

4408.239 --> 4414.959999999999
you just imagine the box is goes on

4411.679 --> 4418.0
forever and so does the stat that's it

4414.96 --> 4420.4
that's what space outer space

4418.0 --> 4422.96
fantasy is the imagination that there is

4420.4 --> 4424.839999999999
infinite room on top

4422.96 --> 4427.44
of the

4424.84 --> 4430.0
decreasing air pressure

4427.44 --> 4430.0
gradient

4430.239 --> 4434.4
but it can't be because that's not how

4432.159 --> 4436.639999999999
gas is going to divide within contained

4434.4 --> 4439.639999999999
space that's not how gradients would

4436.64 --> 4439.64
work

4441.12 --> 4445.36
right

4442.32 --> 4448.08
gas will never divide any gradient no

4445.36 --> 4451.36
matter really what you do

4448.08 --> 4453.199
to the level where there will be a very

4451.36 --> 4455.199
very microscopic

4453.199 --> 4458.799999999999
super thick

4455.199 --> 4462.48
as in pressure wise thick layer of gas

4458.8 --> 4465.28
and then slowly gradiate out

4462.48 --> 4466.959999999999
and then have a vast vast amount of

4465.28 --> 4469.44
almost no pressure

4466.96 --> 4471.92
that never

4469.44 --> 4474.799999999999
ever happens and can never be

4471.92 --> 4477.6
demonstrated no matter what you do that

4474.8 --> 4480.719
could never be created through man-made

4477.6 --> 4482.56
devices ever gases will never do it like

4480.719 --> 4483.84
that they will never gradiate out like

4482.56 --> 4487.4400000000005
that ever

4483.84 --> 4489.6
they will always gradiate out

4487.44 --> 4492.239
within the full spectrum of the

4489.6 --> 4493.679
available container space that's how gas

4492.239 --> 4496.879999999999
gradates out

4493.679 --> 4498.88
and that's the only way it gradiates out

4496.88 --> 4502.159000000001
there's never going to be

4498.88 --> 4504.96
super high pressure super thin layer of

4502.159 --> 4508.48
air in relation to a vast

4504.96 --> 4509.44
amount of space with absolutely no

4508.48 --> 4511.44
pressure

4509.44 --> 4514.639999999999
that can never

4511.44 --> 4517.36
ever be demonstrated ever no matter what

4514.64 --> 4520.0
you do never ever under any mechanical

4517.36 --> 4521.679
circumstances under any insane forces

4520.0 --> 4526.64
you can never

4521.679 --> 4526.64
ever demonstrate that i promise you

4530.159 --> 4534.0
yeah gradient in a container there is a

4532.159 --> 4536.32
gradient you can create gradients in a

4534.0 --> 4540.159
container with temperature differential

4536.32 --> 4542.799999999999
you take an aquarium you put gas in it

4540.159 --> 4546.32
right different sorts whatever

4542.8 --> 4549.92
you close it off it's sealed

4546.32 --> 4552.0
completely closed container or uh yeah

4549.92 --> 4554.719
not isolated because you're going to

4552.0 --> 4556.08
have temperature influences on one side

4554.719 --> 4558.0
of the box

4556.08 --> 4559.5199999999995
you put a cooling element right next to

4558.0 --> 4561.36
the wall

4559.52 --> 4563.1990000000005
on the other side a heating element

4561.36 --> 4566.32
guess what's going to happen gas

4563.199 --> 4568.32
pressure gradient

4566.32 --> 4570.88
every single time gas pressure gradient

4568.32 --> 4572.08
within the closed system

4570.88 --> 4575.12
so yeah

4572.08 --> 4578.719
gradients can absolutely be created

4575.12 --> 4580.96
within containers gas pressure gradients

4578.719 --> 4584.6
that's right it happens

4580.96 --> 4584.6
you can do that

4607.12 --> 4612.48
oh only by adding energy so

4613.36 --> 4616.5599999999995
what's the problem

4614.8 --> 4618.96
i i didn't know there were such

4616.56 --> 4619.679
parameters i didn't know

4618.96 --> 4622.8
but

4619.679 --> 4625.1990000000005
gas cannot gradiate without a contain

4622.8 --> 4627.4400000000005
within a container

4625.199 --> 4629.5199999999995
without energy introduction i'm sorry i

4627.44 --> 4632.239
didn't hear you that i didn't hear that

4629.52 --> 4634.96
as part of the argument before

4632.239 --> 4636.4
i thought you just stated plainly

4634.96 --> 4639.36
you can't have a gradient within a

4636.4 --> 4640.799999999999
container well i proved you wrong and

4639.36 --> 4644.08
guess what

4640.8 --> 4646.8
there is definitely some energy

4644.08 --> 4647.6
constantly being naturally introduced

4646.8 --> 4649.28
here

4647.6 --> 4651.84
measurably

4649.28 --> 4651.84
you know

4653.52 --> 4657.76
so

4654.719 --> 4661.44
well that energy introduction definitely

4657.76 --> 4665.08
reflects the nature of our realm setup

4661.44 --> 4665.08
now doesn't it

4674.159 --> 4679.92
and now you know yeah yeah

4676.239 --> 4683.839999999999
i know i know i wonder if you know too

4679.92 --> 4683.84
or if you blank that out

4684.719 --> 4687.76
i wonder

4685.92 --> 4691.1990000000005
did you actually

4687.76 --> 4694.719
absorb the full scope of my argument

4691.199 --> 4694.719
but did you just ignore it again

4696.0 --> 4699.36
atmosphere

4697.36 --> 4701.199
oh

4699.36 --> 4703.92
yeah we have gas pressure yeah

4701.199 --> 4706.5599999999995
atmosphere is a fictional word you

4703.92 --> 4708.4800000000005
cannot demonstrate

4706.56 --> 4710.8
gas pressure

4708.48 --> 4712.879999999999
it basically

4710.8 --> 4717.360000000001
sticking to a sphere

4712.88 --> 4719.36
without a spherical container

4717.36 --> 4721.759999999999
that doesn't exist that's something you

4719.36 --> 4724.08
can never ever demonstrate

4721.76 --> 4726.2390000000005
right so atmosphere

4724.08 --> 4728.48
is

4726.239 --> 4730.32
just incorrect

4728.48 --> 4733.12
we have gas pressure because it's

4730.32 --> 4735.36
contained and there's a gradient within

4733.12 --> 4736.88
the contained gas pressure

4735.36 --> 4738.719
because well you already said it

4736.88 --> 4741.04
yourself because there's energy

4738.719 --> 4743.76
introduction yeah and that

4741.04 --> 4746.32
well like we can demonstrate ourselves

4743.76 --> 4749.1990000000005
when you have a closed gas container

4746.32 --> 4752.159
put heat on one side colder the other

4749.199 --> 4754.08
a gradient's gonna form so yeah that

4752.159 --> 4756.48
explains exactly

4754.08 --> 4759.28
the setup that we're in and why there is

4756.48 --> 4763.0
a gas pressure gradient

4759.28 --> 4763.0
hello mandy young

4763.76 --> 4767.12
don't apologize to me

4767.36 --> 4771.4
apologize to you

4778.48 --> 4784.86
you've missed quite a show

4781.36 --> 4784.86
[Music]

4789.28 --> 4793.84
yeah i know right one father unit yeah

4791.76 --> 4797.4400000000005
oh they don't like those yes or no

4793.84 --> 4797.4400000000005
questions oh my god they don't

4799.44 --> 4804.0
and it's so funny because they like to

4801.44 --> 4805.04
fantasize sometimes in the heat of the

4804.0 --> 4807.679
moment

4805.04 --> 4809.84
i've heard it a lot i like to fantasize

4807.679 --> 4812.32
flat earthers have trouble with that

4809.84 --> 4815.679
when every time

4812.32 --> 4817.92
every single time they tested me on that

4815.679 --> 4820.56
yes some yes or no it's just immediately

4817.92 --> 4823.92
say yes or no and then i can immediately

4820.56 --> 4823.92
roll out an explanation

4824.4 --> 4831.199
like every time every time every time

4828.4 --> 4834.0
every time every time since i came onto

4831.199 --> 4836.4
youtube every time

4834.0 --> 4837.84
yet they still like to fantasize like we

4836.4 --> 4840.4
cannot deal with

4837.84 --> 4840.400000000001
questions

4840.48 --> 4843.36
it's hilarious

4845.36 --> 4849.36
what yeah anti-flat earth is on the flat

4847.44 --> 4851.44
earth debate sometimes spent like an

4849.36 --> 4854.08
hour straight

4851.44 --> 4855.28
trying to avoid answering a yes or no

4854.08 --> 4859.159
question

4855.28 --> 4859.159
an hour straight

4872.159 --> 4875.28
well

4873.12 --> 4877.28
return to normal technically you know on

4875.28 --> 4878.719
a spiritual level

4877.28 --> 4879.92
they could

4878.719 --> 4882.0
answer

4879.92 --> 4885.6
them the questions properly to save

4882.0 --> 4888.48
their lives they're just choosing not to

4885.6 --> 4892.56
instead they choose to answer or rather

4888.48 --> 4894.239
not answer it to save their dreams

4892.56 --> 4895.1990000000005
you see

4894.239 --> 4896.799999999999
again

4895.199 --> 4900.599999999999
realm of satan

4896.8 --> 4900.6
over realm of god

4902.56 --> 4906.04
that's their prioritization

4928.159 --> 4931.759999999999
that's [Â __Â ]

4929.76 --> 4934.56
stone monkey3d i don't know where you

4931.76 --> 4937.280000000001
got that that's just a stinking pile of

4934.56 --> 4940.080000000001
[Â __Â ] rumor

4937.28 --> 4942.08
garbage i expected more from you this is

4940.08 --> 4943.44
just

4942.08 --> 4944.48
media

4943.44 --> 4946.48
level

4944.48 --> 4947.599999999999
garbage that you're outputting right now

4946.48 --> 4949.199
and and

4947.6 --> 4951.4400000000005
i've seen this more from you are you

4949.199 --> 4954.719
like trying to become a anti-flat earth

4951.44 --> 4954.719
journalist or something

4957.679 --> 4962.4800000000005
just

4959.199 --> 4964.48
poison percentage

4962.48 --> 4967.44
in your words is

4964.48 --> 4971.159
gradually increasing over the years

4967.44 --> 4971.159
stone monkey 3d

4985.28 --> 4990.4
i mean if any even a hint of what you

4988.32 --> 4993.12
just said is true

4990.4 --> 4995.44
there's videos of it on other channels

4993.12 --> 4997.44
oh you mean people blabbering on

4995.44 --> 5001.599999999999
endlessly

4997.44 --> 5002.879999999999
or is it actually the original video

5001.6 --> 5004.719
material

5002.88 --> 5007.36
from the people

5004.719 --> 5008.32
and then like halted at some point and

5007.36 --> 5011.12
like

5008.32 --> 5013.599999999999
views on it details given like a proper

5011.12 --> 5014.4
analysis was it that or is it just

5013.6 --> 5017.1990000000005
people

5014.4 --> 5020.48
oh look the video yeah we're just gonna

5017.199 --> 5022.96
quickly watch it once and then

5020.48 --> 5024.959999999999
not actually look into the details of

5022.96 --> 5027.12
what's happening and just slander the

5024.96 --> 5029.84
[Â __Â ] out of everything was it those

5027.12 --> 5029.84
types of videos

5030.639 --> 5034.719
because that's usually what anti-flat

5032.88 --> 5037.679
earthers end up doing

5034.719 --> 5042.0
they don't talk about it

5037.679 --> 5046.159
they just [Â __Â ] on things

5042.0 --> 5046.159
and then get all self gratified about it

5055.44 --> 5058.96
right if that's real jesus

5059.199 --> 5062.96
god

5060.32 --> 5067.48
oh god no

5062.96 --> 5067.4800000000005
i think it's another freaking gay parade

5070.88 --> 5074.4400000000005
yeah netherlands

5106.159 --> 5108.879999999999
yeah that's right unbelievable

5107.44 --> 5111.879999999999
production it's good to see you by the

5108.88 --> 5111.88
way

5113.52 --> 5119.76
is it okay if i give you a wrench or are

5115.92 --> 5123.36
you one of those that refuse it

5119.76 --> 5123.360000000001
because i i do trust you

5124.96 --> 5128.88
i really like your comments overall

5135.199 --> 5138.199
cool

5143.92 --> 5147.76
the mold effect

5148.0 --> 5150.88
you mean fungus

5153.44 --> 5157.44
but

5154.639 --> 5160.0
i don't know i i don't know exactly what

5157.44 --> 5164.08
you're talking about though

5160.0 --> 5167.28
are you like i like uh i do know that

5164.08 --> 5169.199
moonlight apparently increases fungal

5167.28 --> 5170.88
growth

5169.199 --> 5172.4
right that's the thing is that what

5170.88 --> 5175.36
you're referring to or is it something

5172.4 --> 5175.36
completely different

5178.719 --> 5185.6
check it out

5182.0 --> 5187.36
not fungal okay something else

5185.6 --> 5190.400000000001
gene

5187.36 --> 5190.4
right yeah sure man

5191.44 --> 5195.08
i'll give you a wrench

5220.639 --> 5226.2390000000005
but do you mean like those weird

5223.44 --> 5228.32
water tube fountains

5226.239 --> 5230.08
where they have like a very specific

5228.32 --> 5234.08
type of pressure effect and there's like

5230.08 --> 5234.08
these perfect lines of waters

5234.48 --> 5239.839999999999
like they almost like they create like

5236.719 --> 5241.76
they figured out the ballistics

5239.84 --> 5244.2390000000005
of water with that is that what you're

5241.76 --> 5244.2390000000005
talking about

5247.6 --> 5252.76
check the link yeah you you haven't

5249.12 --> 5252.76
posted a link yet

5257.44 --> 5260.5599999999995
actual g what

5261.199 --> 5264.199
what

5276.4 --> 5279.4
hmm

5290.32 --> 5298.0
oh that thing

5293.04 --> 5298.0
right just like the staircase springs

5299.199 --> 5304.96
it's yeah that's just

5301.84 --> 5304.96
it's just what it is

5306.239 --> 5311.678999999999
that is momentum

5308.88 --> 5315.4400000000005
it's momentum and it is also the pull so

5311.679 --> 5315.4400000000005
it's a combination of momentum

5315.679 --> 5320.96
of things that have weight and then the

5317.199 --> 5320.96
pull it works with water too

5321.6 --> 5325.360000000001
right

5322.8 --> 5326.400000000001
it's very similar to like water straw

5325.36 --> 5330.04
pooling

5326.4 --> 5330.04
it's very fascinating

5338.639 --> 5344.0
no such thing as pull no no it's the

5341.679 --> 5345.76
bond it's the pull of the bonds between

5344.0 --> 5348.96
the material

5345.76 --> 5350.56
so if it has

5348.96 --> 5354.4
some weight

5350.56 --> 5356.56
in relation to the surrounding density

5354.4 --> 5358.719
it's a high density it will basically

5356.56 --> 5360.4800000000005
fall down whatever it is and then

5358.719 --> 5362.08
everything that's directly connected to

5360.48 --> 5363.36
it will be pulled with it because of

5362.08 --> 5365.679
momentum

5363.36 --> 5366.719
if it's all interlinked then yeah it

5365.679 --> 5370.08
will

5366.719 --> 5372.719
go like a chain just like that

5370.08 --> 5375.04
right the more

5372.719 --> 5377.679
room all of it has to fall if you do

5375.04 --> 5378.48
that like from a

5377.679 --> 5380.56
a

5378.48 --> 5383.839999999999
high-rise building

5380.56 --> 5386.0
then the more the chain is out and

5383.84 --> 5388.08
falling the faster the whole thing will

5386.0 --> 5390.08
be pulled along with it

5388.08 --> 5391.28
the more room the entire thing has to

5390.08 --> 5393.84
fall

5391.28 --> 5396.0
the more pull it will have on the rest

5393.84 --> 5397.84
of it the faster it will be pulled with

5396.0 --> 5398.639
down with it down

5397.84 --> 5402.12
yeah

5398.639 --> 5402.12
interesting stuff

5414.719 --> 5418.56
i'm not talking about fundamental

5416.719 --> 5422.719
physics though i'm talking about the

5418.56 --> 5422.719
specific effect of the setup

5422.8 --> 5428.8
of the chain fountain effect

5426.32 --> 5431.599999999999
that's a specific situation happening

5428.8 --> 5435.52
that's not universal right it's all very

5431.6 --> 5437.1990000000005
easily explainable by relative density

5435.52 --> 5438.96
and momentum

5437.199 --> 5440.0
that's what's going on

5438.96 --> 5441.679
and the

5440.0 --> 5444.08
inter yeah the

5441.679 --> 5445.36
material pull right it's connected it

5444.08 --> 5447.28
will

5445.36 --> 5449.839999999999
if one thing goes it'll pull on the

5447.28 --> 5449.84
other

5451.52 --> 5456.159000000001
no it's not nonsense now we're talking

5453.92 --> 5459.36
about mechanical pull this is

5456.159 --> 5462.159
architecture pull and push architecture

5459.36 --> 5464.239
solid things this is not universal

5462.159 --> 5467.36
physics including gas

5464.239 --> 5470.5599999999995
this is just about physical and to some

5467.36 --> 5470.5599999999995
degree liquid things

5472.48 --> 5477.839999999999
so a practical way to explain it

5482.4 --> 5488.92
okay hobas

5485.28 --> 5488.92
do i know you

5525.44 --> 5531.28
and thanks by the way but

5528.56 --> 5533.84
i don't remember a hobbies i don't know

5531.28 --> 5533.84
if you're it

5537.76 --> 5542.76
if it is the last time i've seen you is

5550.159 --> 5556.32
like 12 15 years ago

5553.199 --> 5556.32
no you don't okay

5556.639 --> 5559.8
all right

5585.12 --> 5588.76
probably not

5588.96 --> 5594.56
well

5591.199 --> 5594.5599999999995
if i knew you

5594.719 --> 5598.199
you would know

5612.0 --> 5617.859
come on

5614.67 --> 5617.859
[Applause]

5623.92 --> 5626.32
come on

5626.88 --> 5631.84
oh all the way over there yeah then i

5629.76 --> 5635.04
most certainly do not know you

5631.84 --> 5637.28
i've never been there ever

5635.04 --> 5637.28
right

5641.44 --> 5648.719
hungry wolf all right

5644.56 --> 5648.719
right so you're from friesland

5653.84 --> 5659.719
are you all white-haired nordic looking

5656.719 --> 5659.719
too

5664.239 --> 5667.239
right

5673.28 --> 5676.639
oh nice to meet you

5676.719 --> 5684.0
i'm no mongolian

5679.92 --> 5684.0
what you're oh you are mongol what

5685.28 --> 5687.84
really

5688.96 --> 5694.52
as in

5690.4 --> 5694.5199999999995
the region north of china

5718.0 --> 5722.159
or is it not that kind of mongolian

5722.32 --> 5727.599999999999
is it like down syndrome or something

5725.36 --> 5730.719
not that i mine

5727.6 --> 5730.719
sounds like a great guy

5731.36 --> 5736.48
oh my god

5733.84 --> 5738.4800000000005
look at this

5736.48 --> 5741.839999999999
look at these anti-flat earthers they

5738.48 --> 5745.04
just keep chanting

5741.84 --> 5747.1990000000005
like after you addressed it all

5745.04 --> 5748.84
now the actual country okay

5747.199 --> 5752.75
right all right

5748.84 --> 5752.75
[Laughter]

5753.679 --> 5758.8
i have no objection to that either

5756.4 --> 5761.799999999999
just don't come tearing down my wall god

5758.8 --> 5761.8
dammit

5799.84 --> 5803.360000000001
right yeah by the way

5804.32 --> 5809.04
are you

5806.32 --> 5809.04
were you like

5809.199 --> 5814.0
are you like from the country or did you

5811.92 --> 5817.4400000000005
really grow up in the netherlands like

5814.0 --> 5818.96
your ancestors came from mongolia

5817.44 --> 5821.919999999999
because

5818.96 --> 5823.04
i am kind of curious always to hear

5821.92 --> 5824.4
about

5823.04 --> 5826.8
like

5824.4 --> 5829.599999999999
information and like

5826.8 --> 5831.4400000000005
ancient family stories from mongolian

5829.6 --> 5833.119000000001
people

5831.44 --> 5836.32
because they

5833.119 --> 5840.5599999999995
like carry some really old [Â __Â ]

5836.32 --> 5843.44
it's very fascinating when you hear it

5840.56 --> 5845.92
mongolia sucks

5843.44 --> 5845.919999999999
okay

5846.639 --> 5850.719
yeah

5848.96 --> 5853.679
now well it doesn't suck they're

5850.719 --> 5856.32
actually extremely based but yeah it's

5853.679 --> 5858.4800000000005
it's not a uh

5856.32 --> 5862.639
it's not as convenient

5858.48 --> 5867.08
as things get here in the west right

5862.639 --> 5867.08
but they're very hardy people

5868.0 --> 5872.239
have some really healthy traditions

5875.679 --> 5880.2390000000005
and some

5877.119 --> 5881.36
less healthy traditions probably too

5880.239 --> 5885.5199999999995
but

5881.36 --> 5885.5199999999995
yeah i don't know fascinating people

5888.8 --> 5892.4800000000005
that's some cool cities and nice statues

5891.6 --> 5895.4800000000005
what

5892.48 --> 5895.48
okay

5905.44 --> 5910.48
communism [Â __Â ] it up no doubt no doubt

5908.4 --> 5912.879999999999
bro

5910.48 --> 5915.5199999999995
communism [Â __Â ] everything up that's

5912.88 --> 5915.52
what it does

5916.8 --> 5922.0
it's like

5918.08 --> 5924.4
a cultural disease it literally is

5922.0 --> 5926.96
and people don't play it overplay they

5924.4 --> 5929.04
can do with it whatever they want

5926.96 --> 5931.52
but the fact remains that everything

5929.04 --> 5933.119
that actually gets touched by it and

5931.52 --> 5938.400000000001
lets it in

5933.119 --> 5941.28
it all receives damage and the damage

5938.4 --> 5942.96
often is irrevocable

5941.28 --> 5944.88
it's like a curse

5942.96 --> 5946.639
it's a curse on the land and on the

5944.88 --> 5950.08
people

5946.639 --> 5954.8
once you let it in you're [Â __Â ]

5950.08 --> 5957.679
and i worry too for well western society

5954.8 --> 5959.360000000001
whatever is left of it by now

5957.679 --> 5961.04
because

5959.36 --> 5963.199
they let in

5961.04 --> 5965.6
socialism to some degree and now

5963.199 --> 5967.678999999999
communism is kind of being forced in

5965.6 --> 5969.280000000001
there through

5967.679 --> 5972.159
corporate

5969.28 --> 5972.159
overlords

5972.719 --> 5975.679
right

5973.6 --> 5977.679
but yeah thankfully not everybody's

5975.679 --> 5980.56
buying it but there's still people that

5977.679 --> 5982.159
are just like they want to virtue signal

5980.56 --> 5984.56
like they're buying it i don't know if

5982.159 --> 5986.4
they're actually all buying it but man

5984.56 --> 5988.320000000001
there's plenty of dutch people

5986.4 --> 5990.96
everywhere that are like

5988.32 --> 5993.599999999999
very rebellious

5990.96 --> 5995.199
they've only gotten more rebellious

5993.6 --> 5999.360000000001
they just gotta be careful they're not

5995.199 --> 6000.719
all just gonna turn into savages

5999.36 --> 6004.88
and like

6000.719 --> 6006.159
panic over crazy fantasy [Â __Â ]

6004.88 --> 6007.76
evil [Â __Â ]

6006.159 --> 6009.839999999999
because that's not healthy and it's not

6007.76 --> 6011.84
productive

6009.84 --> 6013.76
and it's not going to help you gain a

6011.84 --> 6015.76
grip on society either it's just going

6013.76 --> 6019.400000000001
to isolate you

6015.76 --> 6019.400000000001
that's always the risk

6022.8 --> 6026.159000000001
anyway good to have you in chat

6030.48 --> 6033.799999999999
what's that

6036.639 --> 6041.52
spacecraft satellites

6039.44 --> 6044.96
looking down on earth

6041.52 --> 6046.4800000000005
with the beautiful not the scale

6044.96 --> 6049.44
continents

6046.48 --> 6052.08
where the us in one shot looks much

6049.44 --> 6055.839999999999
bigger than in the other

6052.08 --> 6056.88
yeah beautiful satellite shots

6055.84 --> 6058.56
that are

6056.88 --> 6061.119
within

6058.56 --> 6063.280000000001
different shots made at the apparent

6061.119 --> 6066.32
same distance with the globe supposedly

6063.28 --> 6067.84
the same size having different scales of

6066.32 --> 6070.159
the landscape

6067.84 --> 6075.52
that is actually visible on it

6070.159 --> 6075.5199999999995
yeah the beautiful satellite shots

6078.4 --> 6084.32
if you really believe that

6080.639 --> 6084.32
then you are willingly ignorant

6085.119 --> 6091.5199999999995
the evidence is blatantly there

6088.8 --> 6095.04
that it's fake

6091.52 --> 6097.92
it's photoshop because it has to be

6095.04 --> 6101.199
and yeah the different pictures made

6097.92 --> 6103.36
have different sizes of the continents

6101.199 --> 6105.678999999999
in relation to

6103.36 --> 6110.0
the supposed globe you're seeing

6105.679 --> 6110.0
makes no freaking sense whatsoever

6116.0 --> 6124.32
usa skill easily explain oh my god oh

6120.639 --> 6126.08
just let just let him squirt guys

6124.32 --> 6129.4
i think we got a serious boomer on our

6126.08 --> 6129.4
hands here

6153.36 --> 6158.5599999999995
so proof of fake satellites are

6155.679 --> 6158.56
available where

6161.28 --> 6166.719
what does that mean

6162.88 --> 6169.04
how can you have proof of something fake

6166.719 --> 6171.6
that cannot exist

6169.04 --> 6173.28
you can't prove something is fake when

6171.6 --> 6175.679
it doesn't exist

6173.28 --> 6176.639
you can only point out how it cannot

6175.679 --> 6179.679
exist

6176.639 --> 6182.159000000001
and how what you are being presented as

6179.679 --> 6184.4
being proof of his existence

6182.159 --> 6187.92
is off there are things that don't make

6184.4 --> 6189.759999999999
sense about it like the scale of the

6187.92 --> 6192.719
site being completely off it which is

6189.76 --> 6195.1990000000005
something that never happens when you're

6192.719 --> 6197.76
actually looking at a great distance at

6195.199 --> 6198.719
a euclidean object

6197.76 --> 6203.719
yeah

6198.719 --> 6203.719
that doesn't and cannot happen

6204.96 --> 6209.52
unless you are

6206.719 --> 6213.76
knowingly and withholding the data

6209.52 --> 6213.76
distorting the actual image

6215.36 --> 6220.159
and yeah as soon as you say that well if

6217.52 --> 6222.96
there is distortion detected in the

6220.159 --> 6225.28
imagery that means it's not as is it's

6222.96 --> 6226.159
not just a photograph it does it's not

6225.28 --> 6229.679
fo

6226.159 --> 6231.599999999999
a photograph of something natural as is

6229.679 --> 6232.639
that's the conclusion you would have to

6231.6 --> 6235.4400000000005
draw

6232.639 --> 6238.76
unless you want to be willingly ignorant

6235.44 --> 6238.759999999999
about it

6241.32 --> 6244.5
[Music]

6252.08 --> 6256.719
ah one for the unit right

6255.199 --> 6258.96
exactly

6256.719 --> 6262.32
proof of fake unicorns is available

6258.96 --> 6263.36
where exactly that that's

6262.32 --> 6266.4
that's

6263.36 --> 6269.96
the question he asked

6266.4 --> 6269.96
makes no sense

6283.84 --> 6287.400000000001
it don't spam

6290.8 --> 6293.04
right

6293.36 --> 6299.639
usa size effect

6296.639 --> 6299.639
how

6311.199 --> 6316.159
i mean you're just saying yeah there is

6313.92 --> 6319.04
something you can do oh yeah i recognize

6316.159 --> 6321.679
there is a size issue it's no problem

6319.04 --> 6324.639
but you're not actually giving me the

6321.679 --> 6326.159
mechanical details on how that works

6324.639 --> 6327.6
though you're just saying oh you could

6326.159 --> 6330.5599999999995
do it oh you

6327.6 --> 6332.159000000001
what's next just google it just google

6330.56 --> 6334.159000000001
it and you'll figure it out is that your

6332.159 --> 6337.44
next response

6334.159 --> 6340.48
fly me to da noon

6337.44 --> 6342.239
is that going to be your next response

6340.48 --> 6344.718999999999
photographic club from different

6342.239 --> 6348.879999999999
distances

6344.719 --> 6348.88
it's not different distances

6354.4 --> 6358.28
that makes no sense

6365.76 --> 6370.08
you don't seem to fully understand

6370.84 --> 6376.56
like how big this presupposed globe is

6374.8 --> 6378.639
supposed to be

6376.56 --> 6381.1990000000005
right

6378.639 --> 6383.84
this is not some miniature you're

6381.199 --> 6385.199
looking at through a

6383.84 --> 6388.32
looking glass

6385.199 --> 6390.96
right this is supposed to be a massive

6388.32 --> 6392.88
freaking thing

6390.96 --> 6395.76
that you're looking at at a vast

6392.88 --> 6398.56
distance pre-supposedly through

6395.76 --> 6400.88
well a vacuum extremely thin air it's

6398.56 --> 6402.96
only thick supposedly on the surface

6400.88 --> 6405.679
right so how

6402.96 --> 6408.08
can the scale be that off

6405.679 --> 6410.4
this is not a miniature you're looking

6408.08 --> 6414.88
at through a looking glass

6410.4 --> 6418.759999999999
this is a supposed giant thing

6414.88 --> 6418.76
makes no sense bro

6432.08 --> 6439.199
see oh yeah just do it

6434.48 --> 6441.199
you figure it out i'm gonna make a claim

6439.199 --> 6442.719
i'm gonna make a claim about how it is

6441.199 --> 6445.678999999999
possible

6442.719 --> 6447.52
just build it yourself just make

6445.679 --> 6449.679
little things right

6447.52 --> 6453.52
when we're actually supposedly dealing

6449.679 --> 6453.52
with a huge ball

6454.08 --> 6459.36
and just yeah just do the miniature and

6456.48 --> 6461.759999999999
oh you'll find some way

6459.36 --> 6464.32
to explain it away

6461.76 --> 6467.84
even though yeah does that happen on the

6464.32 --> 6471.48
large scale does it

6467.84 --> 6471.4800000000005
i don't think so

6480.8 --> 6485.84
test your climate no i'm not

6483.36 --> 6485.839999999999
no

6486.08 --> 6489.76
right

6487.119 --> 6492.88
i'm only going as far

6489.76 --> 6495.4400000000005
to even help you presuppose all this

6492.88 --> 6497.4400000000005
garbage [Â __Â ] which is completely

6495.44 --> 6499.199
physically impossible to ever be

6497.44 --> 6501.44
performed ever

6499.199 --> 6505.04
it's complete garbage everything about

6501.44 --> 6508.48
it right i'm just entertaining you in

6505.04 --> 6510.8
this instance for the sole reason

6508.48 --> 6513.119
of trying to point out how

6510.8 --> 6515.360000000001
within the presuppositional setup of

6513.119 --> 6517.839999999999
what you believe that is it doesn't make

6515.36 --> 6520.88
any sense that is all i'm not going to

6517.84 --> 6523.28
entertain your garbage bro

6520.88 --> 6527.119
it's it cannot exist

6523.28 --> 6529.239
it is fake

6527.119 --> 6532.4
cannot exist it's a second law of

6529.239 --> 6534.799999999999
thermodynamics violation the entire idea

6532.4 --> 6534.799999999999
of it

6535.679 --> 6538.679
right

6549.44 --> 6553.04
no

6550.239 --> 6556.32
them vs them fears us no

6553.04 --> 6558.56
they don't think that nobody thinks that

6556.32 --> 6560.96
you think that and then your straw man

6558.56 --> 6562.719
accusing others of thinking that when

6560.96 --> 6565.96
you're the one that came up with that in

6562.719 --> 6565.96
you alone

6583.599 --> 6586.4800000000005
yeah that's fine

6589.84 --> 6594.8
right

6591.199 --> 6596.48
yeah so okay fly me to da noon in that

6594.8 --> 6598.719
case hey

6596.48 --> 6601.598999999999
let's just say i was wrong about the

6598.719 --> 6604.32
scaling thing right

6601.599 --> 6606.08
you know what i'll do about it

6604.32 --> 6608.5599999999995
i'll just never

6606.08 --> 6610.96
ever bring it up again

6608.56 --> 6613.280000000001
and fall back to the position where all

6610.96 --> 6617.36
of this entertaining

6613.28 --> 6620.8
the idea of it is completely impossible

6617.36 --> 6622.08
you see i don't care i was just trying

6620.8 --> 6624.56
to

6622.08 --> 6626.719
elucidate something right something that

6624.56 --> 6628.639
stood out to me like

6626.719 --> 6630.32
this makes no sense to me well if you

6628.639 --> 6633.28
say all roads

6630.32 --> 6635.28
it's all about scale in the distance and

6633.28 --> 6638.159
blah blah and you can test this first

6635.28 --> 6641.599
that's super cute that's super cute then

6638.159 --> 6644.32
i guess it was a micro mind trap

6641.599 --> 6646.639
that they specifically put there to lure

6644.32 --> 6649.119
people out in their doubts

6646.639 --> 6650.96
but yeah making them presuppose the

6649.119 --> 6653.679
whole [Â __Â ] thing is true in the first

6650.96 --> 6656.4800000000005
place and even possible it isn't

6653.679 --> 6657.599
it's absolutely impossible to do any of

6656.48 --> 6660.4
that

6657.599 --> 6662.0
which is required to even suggest that

6660.4 --> 6665.04
those photographs

6662.0 --> 6667.52
can be real right but if there is some

6665.04 --> 6670.88
weird scaling issue with the surface due

6667.52 --> 6673.92
to distance etc etc fine i guess i fell

6670.88 --> 6677.119
for it i'll just never ever bring it up

6673.92 --> 6679.76
again and fall back to where none of it

6677.119 --> 6682.719
can be physically possible

6679.76 --> 6684.400000000001
it violates natural law in

6682.719 --> 6688.0
too many ways

6684.4 --> 6688.0
it is physically impossible

6689.36 --> 6691.679
right

6692.96 --> 6698.8
yeah and now

6695.119 --> 6701.04
you can get the [Â __Â ] out of here

6698.8 --> 6701.04
bye

6704.4 --> 6710.239
right i'm gonna round out the show

6707.36 --> 6712.0
so thanks everyone for coming

6710.239 --> 6713.839999999999
almost two hours

6712.0 --> 6715.84
if you like this show

6713.84 --> 6718.159000000001
then please don't forget to rogan's it

6715.84 --> 6719.28
up and if you haven't already subscribe

6718.159 --> 6721.28
to my channel and hit the bell
