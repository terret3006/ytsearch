remember who did that but yet to leave

178.39 --> 183.73
oh yeah I was about the skinwalkers not

180.459 --> 186.25
I watched a part of it but these guys

183.73 --> 190.89999999999998
were just goofing around so much there's

186.25 --> 195.01
just no information it just seemed all

190.9 --> 196.76000000000002
very silly and goofy and unclear because

195.01 --> 198.69
of the goofing around

196.76 --> 204.85
[Music]

198.69 --> 211.82999999999998
yeah all right Aaron Johnson's mostly

204.85 --> 214.39
mostly again about Bigfoot because oh I

211.83 --> 217.739
brought that up and now suddenly people

214.39 --> 217.73899999999998
just can't leave it alone

237.08 --> 242.81
sorry to hear you don't like the new

240.319 --> 248.569
show format stone monkey 3d I don't

242.81 --> 249.709
really see what why your OCD is playing

248.569 --> 251.78
on it so much

249.709 --> 255.25
yeah it is all improvised it's not to

251.78 --> 260.299
scale things to stretch out and I know

255.25 --> 262.61
and to be fair I've also yeah looking

260.299 --> 267.229
been looking around and how other people

262.61 --> 270.11
set up their their show look yeah and

267.229 --> 273.289
mine I don't know I could upgrade

270.11 --> 275.96000000000004
further at it I think that when I'm

273.289 --> 280.84
going to do D life I'm probably good

275.96 --> 286.52
just on the spot gonna try to redesign

280.84 --> 289.60999999999996
what my show could look like also I like

286.52 --> 293.289
the concept of transparent chat boxes

289.61 --> 296.389
that could basically be projected over

293.289 --> 298.69
over the video screen that looked

296.389 --> 298.69
interesting

299.77 --> 302.839
[Music]

307.479 --> 314.86
yeah yeah I had a good night rest

310.389 --> 320.78000000000003
managed to not go to bed extremely late

314.86 --> 324.22900000000004
still caught Owen Benjamin live I was on

320.78 --> 325.58
josÃ©'s for a short while but yeah things

324.229 --> 327.979
were so energetic

325.58 --> 330.46999999999997
I was basically from passing rumpus and

327.979 --> 332.96
rumpus was rum pissing me I don't know

330.47 --> 337.34000000000003
if anybody caught anything about that it

332.96 --> 339.5
was a but yeah and that kind of setup

337.34 --> 341.75
when the only thing you can really do is

339.5 --> 347.03
rumpus I just kept it basic and kept out

341.75 --> 348.759
and repeating yeah the core arguments in

347.03 --> 351.5
a few words and kept on doing that

348.759 --> 353.659
because yeah otherwise they were just

351.5 --> 356.199
immediately got a red herring away from

353.659 --> 356.199
the argument

370.31 --> 378.78000000000003
sorry stone monkey 3d look hey if you

373.68 --> 380.819
can build something better like a gift

378.78 --> 384.11999999999995
with transparent capacities and

380.819 --> 387.15000000000003
everything and you want to me to try

384.12 --> 389.88
that out I'm I'm I have been open for

387.15 --> 395.38899999999995
options from the beginning as soon as I

389.88 --> 398.55
started using this you know I'm open for

395.389 --> 400.5
four options not so much for suggestions

398.55 --> 406.56
because hey I am not really all that

400.5 --> 408.18
great in building this kind of stuff but

406.56 --> 411.75
if yeah there's a lot of people out

408.18 --> 414.12
there that are good at it and if you got

411.75 --> 420.21
something I'll try it out if I like it

414.12 --> 423.63
so yeah contact me on skype or at some

420.21 --> 426.77
point give me a link to a place where

423.63 --> 429.75
this specific item you want me to use is

426.77 --> 431.58
stored on the web and I'll download it

429.75 --> 434.159
and yeah

431.58 --> 437.729
if you got a problem with something you

434.159 --> 441.8
can do something about it not I'm not

437.729 --> 441.8
giving any guarantees here but hey

442.18 --> 447.71
[Music]

444.38 --> 447.71
l'amanda you

471.91 --> 474.91
right

483.06 --> 489.15
yeah I am Andy young yeah I'm feeling

485.7 --> 490.8
I'm feeling okay a little tense but not

489.15 --> 493.5
because of personal issues it's just

490.8 --> 499.14
that kind of been watching from the

493.5 --> 503.46
sidelines in in the news and yeah this

499.14 --> 506.4
the this situation with Iran it is

503.46 --> 512.67
getting very serious and I'm a bit

506.4 --> 514.92
worried about it it yeah I've seen a lot

512.67 --> 517.89
of things concerning that from a very

514.92 --> 520.9699999999999
unique angle and I've been expecting

517.89 --> 528.11
this to happen at some point

520.97 --> 533.51
Iran first that's where it gets real and

528.11 --> 538.17
yeah so I'm a little tense about that

533.51 --> 542.22
and I yeah I don't like I never liked

538.17 --> 545.52
where this how this changes the the face

542.22 --> 548.58
of the landscape like the the atmosphere

545.52 --> 555.09
of the people and what they do and and

548.58 --> 560.82
the groups it yeah I don't like it well

555.09 --> 564.75
yeah hm I know fear porn yeah expected

560.82 --> 566.88
you to pump it out because aid the

564.75 --> 569.58
programming has already been fully

566.88 --> 571.41
initiated for everything that could

569.58 --> 573.8000000000001
potentially happen what we should be

571.41 --> 573.8
afraid of

575.14 --> 578.1999999999999
[Music]

582.53 --> 585.8199999999999
[Music]

595.33 --> 603.149
what are you talking about baits 60 RMC

599.01 --> 603.149
comment from the main screen

645.67 --> 648.7199999999999
[Music]

656.68 --> 661.3789999999999
is that the real bait 60 or MC

668.99 --> 676.52
I know around but oh you are from Iran

671.93 --> 680.4799999999999
wow I didn't know that interesting but

676.52 --> 683.209
yeah I totally agree but that doesn't

680.48 --> 687.1700000000001
mean that it's not tense and it doesn't

683.209 --> 689.5
it does make things look ugly it's not

687.17 --> 689.5
good

711.52 --> 720.1
well Matthew Mitchell look and it

715.57 --> 723.58
shouldn't affect you well I am a

720.1 --> 728.0500000000001
sensitive person I kind of like leash my

723.58 --> 730.39
senses upon the world to to give me an

728.05 --> 732.76
extra edge in figuring out what is real

730.39 --> 736.48
what is not and it does affect me

732.76 --> 740.41
because it affects a lot of people now I

736.48 --> 742.75
have defenses against that influence but

740.41 --> 745.779
the other people are still affected and

742.75 --> 749.11
I can feel that and I'm influenced by

745.779 --> 753.99
how the entire world is influenced so

749.11 --> 753.99
indirectly it does have effect on me

758.32 --> 761.5590000000001
[Music]

773.76 --> 782.1
yeah yeah Nathan Oakley I heard yeah

779.149 --> 790.26
George is really pissed off about the

782.1 --> 791.9590000000001
whole demon goblin thing and yeah it

790.26 --> 794.61
just can't get over himself

791.959 --> 799.0699999999999
you should know that he technically

794.61 --> 803.22
started it by adding it and get ya

799.07 --> 806.0100000000001
dealing in an unnecessarily low blow in

803.22 --> 809.01
a very personal way to be in the middle

806.01 --> 812.55
of an argument and yeah that's what you

809.01 --> 816.8389999999999
get that's when you turn into a little

812.55 --> 819.75
demon Goblin yeah so I imagine he is so

816.839 --> 824.1
pissed off that I did this because he

819.75 --> 830.12
couldn't help himself that yeah he's

824.1 --> 832.98
been trying to you trying to get Jose to

830.12 --> 836.25
stop letting me on on the show

832.98 --> 841.0690000000001
yeah I heard I don't know if he's doing

836.25 --> 841.069
that somewhere somewhere else but

854.999 --> 864.4490000000001
yes theme doesn't yep

858.699 --> 864.449
I almost forgot that part

877.23 --> 880.33
[Music]

884.21 --> 893.5400000000001
yeah well stallion 8012 not all

891.71 --> 895.61
shootings are fake you know those

893.54 --> 898.779
especially those that actually get

895.61 --> 902.839
caught on camera like that

898.779 --> 906.5
that's super heavy intense that freaking

902.839 --> 909.5600000000001
church shooting with that we with a very

906.5 --> 911.75
creepy little guy with a background

909.56 --> 914.2399999999999
history I heard some about it like he

911.75 --> 916.19
used to be a bum and this this church

914.24 --> 921.23
the people of does Church it actually

916.19 --> 924.9200000000001
took him in and he got nuts and he shot

921.23 --> 927.38
two people before he got shot with with

924.92 --> 929.4499999999999
a clean shot by one of the churchgoers

927.38 --> 931.91
because yeah there were a lot of them

929.45 --> 937.73
were armed first who didn't get there in

931.91 --> 940.2199999999999
time but yeah that is real as you can

937.73 --> 944.0
see it's real you can see the adrenaline

940.22 --> 949.0400000000001
shock wave that is freakin real okay

944.0 --> 950.87
there's no doubt about it and but that

949.04 --> 952.9399999999999
doesn't mean that everything else is

950.87 --> 957.11
exactly like that I don't know it's just

952.94 --> 958.9100000000001
that it was it was really shocking and

957.11 --> 962.72
it was heartbreaking but at the same

958.91 --> 964.76
time it was also still encouraging you

962.72 --> 966.5600000000001
know I think it is actually quite

964.76 --> 971.0889999999999
important especially for American

966.56 --> 975.7399999999999
churches to to have armed Christians

971.089 --> 978.2
there for their own safety god-given

975.74 --> 982.24
right to defend yourself and in these

978.2 --> 982.24
times it's kind of necessary this

985.47 --> 997.769
be vigilant don't be lambs to the

995.439 --> 997.769
slaughter

1000.199 --> 1005.0889999999999
what to hell Nathan Oakley sheesh

1013.38 --> 1017.85
camera angle what

Wow

1235.779 --> 1242.809
yeah sure Nathan I could use some some

1240.23 --> 1252.169
camaraderie because people in this chat

1242.809 --> 1265.039
seem to be going nuts all right I'll

chats talking about what they're talking

1292.07 --> 1298.4289999999999
about I don't know either it's weird and

1295.429 --> 1301.1000000000001
yeah even I shouldn't even talk about

1298.429 --> 1303.6490000000001
this but I got a phone call

1301.1 --> 1307.279
trolling again I hate it they do it very

1303.649 --> 1309.7099999999998
cool troll yeah well it's just a private

1307.279 --> 1312.62
number cause my phone when I pick up

1309.71 --> 1313.97
there's nothing and they there's this I

1312.62 --> 1316.129
don't know it's probably this one guy

1313.97 --> 1319.58
that sometimes does that I think it's

1316.129 --> 1328.82
like Allenby or something it's super

1319.58 --> 1332.649
annoying right so I just turn it off now

1328.82 --> 1337.519
but anyway thanks for coming on the show

1332.649 --> 1339.35
yeah for the longest time I'm never in a

1337.519 --> 1340.759
position to be on the show at this time

1339.35 --> 1343.37
normally it's running around before I

1340.759 --> 1345.529
strapped to a kids party so much okay in

1343.37 --> 1346.9399999999998
a position to actually talk to you

1345.529 --> 1349.49
rather than just watch you in the

1346.94 --> 1351.529
background which is not real ugly all

1349.49 --> 1353.659
right yeah thanks was there anything

1351.529 --> 1356.059
particularly you want to talk about or

1353.659 --> 1358.7890000000002
had something to say about my recent

1356.059 --> 1360.1689999999999
shows for example well you you were

1358.789 --> 1364.73
saying Martha how do you talk about that

1360.169 --> 1366.409
in the trap the 911 thing yeah I mean I

1364.73 --> 1367.13
came in and saw George stamps are

1366.409 --> 1369.1100000000001
talking about

1367.13 --> 1370.67
think along those lines and I was like

1369.11 --> 1372.5
Shh what you're trying to do you get how

1370.67 --> 1377.89
we'd shut down and you thought I was

1372.5 --> 1381.11
talking about different George no George

1377.89 --> 1383.99
Netanyahu well I wasn't referring to

1381.11 --> 1385.79
George oh right okay okay now I

1383.99 --> 1388.69
understand the misunderstanding

1385.79 --> 1392.54
I don't know god what George Sanford did

1388.69 --> 1393.89
he's talked about 9/11 so in my

1392.54 --> 1396.34
sarcastic tone and right look

1393.89 --> 1399.68
everything's legit nothing to see here

1396.34 --> 1400.97
he's like I see and I think maybe that

1399.68 --> 1403.16
might have been what suffered everyone

1400.97 --> 1406.1000000000001
else in the trucks discuss it but it

1403.16 --> 1408.0500000000002
seemed to go from zero to a level of

1406.1 --> 1415.24
about ten pretty much instantly everyone

1408.05 --> 1415.24
talking about 9/11 in your chat 2014

1417.43 --> 1425.3600000000001
yeah I don't know maybe some new news

1420.23 --> 1429.05
has come up or I don't know hmm

1425.36 --> 1431.4799999999998
definitely very much same old same old

1429.05 --> 1433.72
right well who knows how crazy things

1431.48 --> 1436.97
can go you know

1433.72 --> 1439.73
who knows at some point Trump for

1436.97 --> 1442.13
example may just choose to blame 9/11 on

1439.73 --> 1444.2
Iran in some way you know well then

1442.13 --> 1446.0600000000002
it'll definitely be brought back onto

1444.2 --> 1448.31
the table to see whether anything about

1446.06 --> 1450.32
that could be true and all that I don't

1448.31 --> 1454.1
know how crazy things could get at this

1450.32 --> 1456.6499999999999
point I mean Brian Staveley covered live

1454.1 --> 1459.1699999999998
11 for the longest time and recently I

1456.65 --> 1459.92
saw I can remember who's discussing with

1459.17 --> 1462.2
the that he was the guy from

1459.92 --> 1464.3300000000002
psychologists but jail B was chatting

1462.2 --> 1465.92
about Brian Staveley specifically

1464.33 --> 1466.9099999999999
talking about how great is my work on

1465.92 --> 1468.8000000000002
9/11 was a bit

1466.91 --> 1470.18
jeromy's point of view is kind of I

1468.8 --> 1472.8799999999999
don't have someone who covers this

1470.18 --> 1474.23
subject for such a prolonged period but

1472.88 --> 1476.42
I kind of says the same about some flat

1474.23 --> 1478.28
earthers for me he's like you know he's

1476.42 --> 1482.75
doing it for the money than why I wanted

1478.28 --> 1485.66
to put out that when even I work as a

1482.75 --> 1487.22
youtuber but he doesn't say he doesn't

1485.66 --> 1488.8400000000001
you get bored of it with me but he did

1487.22 --> 1491.72
say that about Brian Staveley in regards

1488.84 --> 1495.08
to 9/11 and his current coverage of the

1491.72 --> 1497.33
Mandela effect they kind of say it's

1495.08 --> 1499.1
interesting he's maybe according to

1497.33 --> 1500.24
their speculation got bored of just

1499.1 --> 1502.4289999999999
covering that subject

1500.24 --> 1503.8700000000001
perhaps it's been exhausted in terms of

1502.429 --> 1504.98
the coverage yeah there might be people

1503.87 --> 1507.29
out there that haven't come across the

1504.98 --> 1508.97
coverage yet so there may be various

1507.29 --> 1510.6789999999999
little mini resurgence is here in there

1508.97 --> 1512.9
but ultimately speaking the people that

1510.679 --> 1515.3000000000002
just covered that subject I have moved

1512.9 --> 1517.0700000000002
on or potentially it seems like way we

1515.3 --> 1521.36
Brian slavery is is move on to the

1517.07 --> 1525.53
subject now wait from 9/11 or from

1521.36 --> 1529.52
Mandela effect which one from 9/11 right

1525.53 --> 1532.76
through Mandela refers okay so do you

1529.52 --> 1536.179
think that the 9/11 research community

1532.76 --> 1537.98
has to become kind of saturated then

1536.179 --> 1540.2
I've no idea it's not enough community I

1537.98 --> 1542.24
mean it's lights be interested in you

1540.2 --> 1544.16
know I found out what was going on in

1542.24 --> 1545.83
terms of what was out there a lots and

1544.16 --> 1549.23
lots of lots of different stories

1545.83 --> 1550.34
presumably intentionally understanding

1549.23 --> 1552.6200000000001
which one's the true one you're never

1550.34 --> 1553.8799999999999
gonna know why you altima tweaking you

1552.62 --> 1556.1
know what they've hunted out on the

1553.88 --> 1558.41
mainstream media wasn't necessarily in

1556.1 --> 1561.29
any way shape or form the truth yeah

1558.41 --> 1561.65
well once you know that it's the bottom

1561.29 --> 1564.47
of it

1561.65 --> 1566.0900000000001
probably not you can watch one level

1564.47 --> 1568.49
videos all day long and you'll just get

1566.09 --> 1571.55
a multitude of different versions of

1568.49 --> 1573.77
events the people piece together around

1571.55 --> 1575.4199999999998
all of them probably put out there by

1573.77 --> 1577.19
the people you've been the original

1575.42 --> 1578.21
narrative if you're gonna have people

1577.19 --> 1578.929
looking into it you might as well have

1578.21 --> 1581.83
lost a dead end

1578.929 --> 1584.5400000000002
incorrect false conspiracies

1581.83 --> 1586.58
manufactured at the point source so that

1584.54 --> 1591.29
people will look into them and then lose

1586.58 --> 1591.8
interest when they don't put out yeah

1591.29 --> 1596.51
maybe

1591.8 --> 1598.61
well I there may be some clips that just

1596.51 --> 1602.27
made me feel like there was

1598.61 --> 1604.04
misinformation being injected like but

1602.27 --> 1607.73
I'm not sure about it though but one of

1604.04 --> 1611.84
these things that were the the weird CGI

1607.73 --> 1613.429
like planes remember that that made

1611.84 --> 1616.07
everybody doubt that there was anything

1613.429 --> 1618.38
well that thing the way it looked

1616.07 --> 1621.8
I just get it just gave me the feel like

1618.38 --> 1623.8400000000001
like this there's something wrong about

1621.8 --> 1628.85
this I don't know I don't think there's

1623.84 --> 1631.01
this can be right like I said Mariah she

1628.85 --> 1633.5
castles 14 everybody wearing maybe it's

1631.01 --> 1634.1
the I'm saying you not take 2014 like

1633.5 --> 1636.71
that's for

1634.1 --> 1639.049
found out that it might not be our point

1636.71 --> 1640.45
is suddenly a large chunk of time

1639.049 --> 1642.65
slipped hi everybody

1640.45 --> 1646.19
everyone looking into this in the beam a

1642.65 --> 1648.77
plethora of 9/11 conspiracy debunking

1646.19 --> 1650.6000000000001
some conspiracy videos and various

1648.77 --> 1652.19
different stories of what happened and

1650.6 --> 1653.8899999999999
piecing together the timeline that did

1652.19 --> 1657.0800000000002
actually happen how it's inconsistent

1653.89 --> 1659.0300000000002
it's like the BBC we've seen it though

1657.08 --> 1660.799
right why is it simply because why we

1659.03 --> 1665.57
discussed me right now are we I don't

1660.799 --> 1666.71
know talk about this because it's the

1665.57 --> 1668.539
kind of thing that they want to latch on

1666.71 --> 1669.799
to uShip channels out there take

1668.539 --> 1671.6299999999999
everyone we've got covered anything any

1669.799 --> 1674.24
in any way controversial in terms of how

1671.63 --> 1676.8500000000001
discussing the discussion that has taken

1674.24 --> 1677.9
place in years gone by in any way

1676.85 --> 1679.4289999999999
controversial we're gonna get you

1677.9 --> 1682.789
channel [Â __Â ] though but by the same

1679.429 --> 1684.44
token wants to talk about yeah we could

1682.789 --> 1686.6
rehash every single detail that we've

1684.44 --> 1688.0700000000002
looked down into and supposed to discuss

1686.6 --> 1690.32
the whys and wherefores of which one's

1688.07 --> 1696.1689999999999
the most viable according to you or me

1690.32 --> 1699.1689999999999
and my humble opinion well you know I

1696.169 --> 1701.2990000000002
really wonder how it works like when do

1699.169 --> 1703.49
they start targeting people when they

1701.299 --> 1708.289
talk about it is it just when people

1703.49 --> 1712.07
have general ideas or geopolitical yeah

1708.289 --> 1715.7
ideas and they draw it into that or is

1712.07 --> 1719.1499999999999
it really when some of these people the

1715.7 --> 1722.27
real meticulous investigators try to dig

1719.15 --> 1724.8200000000002
in and then find out all kinds of like

1722.27 --> 1727.49
frauds and cover-ups actually tying it

1724.82 --> 1730.37
into those people that did some things

1727.49 --> 1733.21
and then they target them to just keep

1730.37 --> 1736.7299999999998
it covered up I wonder how the

1733.21 --> 1738.95
application of the of the censorship

1736.73 --> 1742.1
concerning 9/11 really works

1738.95 --> 1743.24
there's no censorship it's please quite

1742.1 --> 1745.2199999999998
the contrary it's like they've

1743.24 --> 1747.14
overabundance of information on it

1745.22 --> 1749.99
there's there's more information on it

1747.14 --> 1752.3600000000001
so you being spam a story in the first

1749.99 --> 1754.64
instance on TV well yeah there's two

1752.36 --> 1756.289
controlled opposition the good that they

1754.64 --> 1758.8400000000001
bring on top of it are of course

1756.289 --> 1763.73
following me my whole story spun from

1758.84 --> 1765.83
her from TV so in terms of what we know

1763.73 --> 1767.6
and what we can acquire information and

1765.83 --> 1770.75
reports and all rest of it

1767.6 --> 1771.9499999999998
come through the same place media so in

1770.75 --> 1773.51
terms of you saying well controlled

1771.95 --> 1775.1000000000001
opposition against it will against what

1773.51 --> 1777.89
the original story that was put out by

1775.1 --> 1780.559
them anyway so that you know they're

1777.89 --> 1782.7700000000002
pulling all of the strings well the

1780.559 --> 1786.6499999999999
point source for me for that is TV

1782.77 --> 1789.559
television okay well would you agree

1786.65 --> 1791.24
that it's the TV forget 9/11 for a

1789.559 --> 1795.1689999999999
second TV is toxic

1791.24 --> 1797.78
would you agree yeah definitely and and

1795.169 --> 1800.96
of all the things on TV there's the most

1797.78 --> 1804.59
toxic would you agree news is the most

1800.96 --> 1807.14
toxic yeah yeah when I watch it I watch

1804.59 --> 1811.6999999999998
it I quit shields up because it's I know

1807.14 --> 1813.76
like yeah they are they try to shove

1811.7 --> 1817.07
nonsense in between things and

1813.76 --> 1819.169
opinionate things a lot yeah exactly

1817.07 --> 1821.6
so I left owned quite early I left home

1819.169 --> 1822.89
at 16 but before I left home my parents

1821.6 --> 1824.6589999999999
like most people have the TV in the

1822.89 --> 1827.75
corner is on most of the time the leaves

1824.659 --> 1831.3500000000001
played on it's our only rolling reports

1827.75 --> 1833.75
and they watched them all so well I

1831.35 --> 1836.6899999999998
watched it I realized at a very early

1833.75 --> 1838.24
age probably eight or nine that the

1836.69 --> 1840.65
stuff on the news reports wasn't real

1838.24 --> 1842.09
they give you disclaimers about the

1840.65 --> 1843.89
horrific scenes about seeing you

1842.09 --> 1845.809
wouldn't see anything things of that

1843.89 --> 1847.5490000000002
nature it not may not have made any

1845.809 --> 1851.09
sense to me so I was like I don't like

1847.549 --> 1853.9089999999999
this I don't want to engage in it so I

1851.09 --> 1855.799
stopped engaging with TV he aged with

1853.909 --> 1858.0800000000002
movies and things of a different nature

1855.799 --> 1860.24
and well I left home I didn't get a TV

1858.08 --> 1861.9189999999999
to stop paying the TV license and didn't

1860.24 --> 1863.96
have one mainly because I was a poor

1861.919 --> 1865.8400000000001
student but I just didn't have one and

1863.96 --> 1868.25
that was massively beneficial and

1865.84 --> 1870.1689999999999
apparent to me from the moment I left

1868.25 --> 1873.2
home and didn't have a TV licence didn't

1870.169 --> 1876.23
watch TV and periodically when I had

1873.2 --> 1877.49
money would get all the TV did you know

1876.23 --> 1878.51
you like well I haven't watched anything

1877.49 --> 1880.4
for three years

1878.51 --> 1882.049
I'll have everything all of the

1880.4 --> 1883.46
satellite channels all of the different

1882.049 --> 1885.08
things that you could have cable the

1883.46 --> 1887.539
full shebang goes with all the packages

1885.08 --> 1889.8799999999999
and within three months you'd watched

1887.539 --> 1891.83
everything it was all done enough he'd

1889.88 --> 1893.3600000000001
watched everything you could watch there

1891.83 --> 1895.79
was there was essentially nothing new

1893.36 --> 1897.4089999999999
after you'd watch three months of TV so

1895.79 --> 1898.73
what you left with is what repeats of

1897.409 --> 1901.47
stuff that you've watched before old

1898.73 --> 1902.909
episodes of Frasier and Friends on go

1901.47 --> 1904.65
or whatever but it's all crying

1902.909 --> 1907.8600000000001
basically being crap and you're left

1904.65 --> 1911.7
with only the toxic bits being new so

1907.86 --> 1914.28
the news well let's get rid of TV again

1911.7 --> 1917.1000000000001
well once you cut out the original

1914.28 --> 1920.6589999999999
narrative so let's pretend you never saw

1917.1 --> 1922.9499999999998
what they told you 9/11 was on TV

1920.659 --> 1926.8700000000001
knowing about the control-top narrative

1922.95 --> 1928.919
as you put it or thee the incorrect

1926.87 --> 1931.049
conspiracy theories about what actually

1928.919 --> 1933.2990000000002
occurred have also been put out by the

1931.049 --> 1935.82
same exact media if you weren't watching

1933.299 --> 1938.37
it you'd be completely unaffected by it

1935.82 --> 1939.87
well they get me wrong obviously too big

1938.37 --> 1942.1499999999999
massive buildings came down in a

1939.87 --> 1943.59
particular part of the world and there's

1942.15 --> 1945.7800000000002
various different other things that are

1943.59 --> 1949.1689999999999
fairly major events that happen almost

1945.78 --> 1951.21
daily around the world mm-hm now on the

1949.169 --> 1953.5800000000002
most part if you can't do anything about

1951.21 --> 1956.52
them literally you can do absolutely

1953.58 --> 1957.8999999999999
nothing about them what consequence does

1956.52 --> 1960.179
it have to you in the big scheme of

1957.9 --> 1962.159
things I'm not so selfish but in the big

1960.179 --> 1966.179
scheme of things if you can't affect it

1962.159 --> 1968.21
and you're letting it affect you then

1966.179 --> 1971.1000000000001
you've only got that element of control

1968.21 --> 1972.929
from that's my opinion from my

1971.1 --> 1978.9599999999998
perspective I don't care anybody else

1972.929 --> 1981.69
right no I can tell the people people

1978.96 --> 1983.46
say oh those people you were wake up I

1981.69 --> 1985.44
don't I'm telling them about what's

1983.46 --> 1987.3600000000001
going on in arguing the subject because

1985.44 --> 1989.909
I I understand my position

1987.36 --> 1991.77
now if you take a benefit from that and

1989.909 --> 1993.48
go wow you've opened my eyes to this

1991.77 --> 1995.52
well good for you mate that's not

1993.48 --> 1996.99
necessarily my intention though so you

1995.52 --> 1999.36
know I'm not looking for the face to be

1996.99 --> 2000.799
woken up to flat earth right but the

1999.36 --> 2002.57
obvious as far as I'm concerned I'm not

2000.799 --> 2005.27
really that big a favor to anybody to

2002.57 --> 2006.6789999999999
say isn't it bloody obvious you look far

2005.27 --> 2009.1689999999999
enough into their rectory that's not

2006.679 --> 2011.21
telling you that it's flat and it seems

2009.169 --> 2013.3400000000001
flat and look slap and it's only because

2011.21 --> 2015.1100000000001
of blah blah maths that you've got to

2013.34 --> 2016.4599999999998
accept that it isn't so if you

2015.11 --> 2018.08
understand on both sides of the fence

2016.46 --> 2020.299
they're saying it's obviously deservedly

2018.08 --> 2022.1589999999999
flat and you don't allow the poisons

2020.299 --> 2024.2
toxicity of all the crap that tells you

2022.159 --> 2026.24
it isn't into your life on the most part

2024.2 --> 2029.57
you just recognize it anyway so for me

2026.24 --> 2032.0
for her especially whatever you like for

2029.57 --> 2034.039
the most part most of those conspiracy

2032.0 --> 2035.27
hits conclusions just dealing with toxic

2034.039 --> 2036.89
entities that putting out

2035.27 --> 2038.87
[Â __Â ] that you're trying to fight against

2036.89 --> 2040.6100000000001
in the first place he fighting against

2038.87 --> 2043.79
their narrative that they put out and

2040.61 --> 2045.29
looking for the truth in that situation

2043.79 --> 2046.73
it's like trying to find the truth in a

2045.29 --> 2048.71
Hollywood movie

2046.73 --> 2051.55
you know like let's try and find out the

2048.71 --> 2053.78
truth behind the matrix it's a movie

2051.55 --> 2056.36
like no different this is a television

2053.78 --> 2059.21
presentation now certain events did

2056.36 --> 2061.3700000000003
actually transpire and occur but is any

2059.21 --> 2064.2200000000003
of the narrative to be considered I

2061.37 --> 2065.7799999999997
don't think so I haven't personally and

2064.22 --> 2067.2799999999997
you know when I looked into it as an

2065.78 --> 2069.26
interesting conspiracy folly it was

2067.28 --> 2073.2200000000003
exactly that an interesting conspiracy

2069.26 --> 2076.3100000000004
folly but five six seven years later is

2073.22 --> 2078.3799999999997
it is it is it of interest to me not

2076.31 --> 2080.63
really the obvious nature of reality

2078.38 --> 2082.909
absolutely is because it doesn't matter

2080.63 --> 2084.679
where you go it's not just media is

2082.909 --> 2086.3
technically everywhere you go everywhere

2084.679 --> 2088.2200000000003
you look and everyone you talk to thinks

2086.3 --> 2090.77
the liberal blogosphere so it's still

2088.22 --> 2091.9089999999997
absolutely fascinating to me and because

2090.77 --> 2094.7599999999998
it's the prevailing religion of the

2091.909 --> 2097.1
Western world but most of the Western

2094.76 --> 2102.71
world move past 9/11 they think you're

2097.1 --> 2105.89
[Â __Â ] anymore yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks

2102.71 --> 2113.32
for the pressure and and I yeah overall

2105.89 --> 2113.3199999999997
agree it it is weird how everyone just

2113.41 --> 2118.8199999999997
it's their own tone like what they allow

2116.81 --> 2122.72
into their consciousness and what they

2118.82 --> 2125.53
avoid and how that works it's very it's

2122.72 --> 2128.24
very intuitive very subconscious and

2125.53 --> 2130.36
most people really don't know what

2128.24 --> 2133.9399999999996
they're doing but their intuition just

2130.36 --> 2136.51
lets them follow a certain path and that

2133.94 --> 2141.4700000000003
path can lead into ruin or into

2136.51 --> 2143.7200000000003
awakening and yeah they have to choose

2141.47 --> 2146.7799999999997
they have to see it and recognize it and

2143.72 --> 2149.93
then make it pretty brave decision

2146.78 --> 2154.25
overall to step away from the pollution

2149.93 --> 2155.48
from the the lies and then oppose them

2154.25 --> 2157.7
deal with them

2155.48 --> 2162.67
it doesn't necessarily start to attack

2157.7 --> 2166.04
everyone on that side because they all

2162.67 --> 2169.069
need their own time to kind of get over

2166.04 --> 2171.89
it because it is a really really is a

2169.069 --> 2177.619
get over its situation everybody's

2171.89 --> 2179.15
facing get over the light oh no no

2177.619 --> 2180.9190000000003
expose yourself to them in the first

2179.15 --> 2182.119
instance is how am i points it's like if

2180.919 --> 2184.3089999999997
there's a certain atrocity that's

2182.119 --> 2187.369
happening today or a certain politician

2184.309 --> 2188.929
that's little for taxes today or a

2187.369 --> 2194.989
certain murderer that's being released

2188.929 --> 2197.839
incorrectly today or what if that's just

2194.989 --> 2200.419
the media narrative spin with a modicum

2197.839 --> 2203.449
of your actual truth somewhere in there

2200.419 --> 2206.269
that you don't know expose just after

2203.449 --> 2207.739
the 95% abort to then say we need to

2206.269 --> 2210.979
find the truth about this [Â __Â ] we've

2207.739 --> 2213.679
been suppose what can you do about it

2210.979 --> 2216.499
how does it actually affect you beyond

2213.679 --> 2218.779
how it is now affecting you so it is now

2216.499 --> 2220.609
affecting you but it didn't happen to

2218.779 --> 2221.419
you you've allowed yourself to be

2220.609 --> 2223.009
affected by it

2221.419 --> 2224.299
and now you've got to get what go all

2223.009 --> 2228.199
the picket lines and tell people about

2224.299 --> 2229.939
the truth so well no you know me today

2228.199 --> 2232.5190000000002
if it wasn't for this conversation now

2229.939 --> 2239.6589999999997
see it's being a party I'd be claiming

2232.519 --> 2244.819
my kids well yeah well they that's your

2239.659 --> 2250.009
choice but I don't know I still do think

2244.819 --> 2253.339
that like people do need a little

2250.009 --> 2256.309
encouragement a little nudge or B have

2253.339 --> 2259.219
their interest piqued about these things

2256.309 --> 2261.38
that are transpiring and I have a lot of

2259.219 --> 2263.599
experience to reflect upon it and share

2261.38 --> 2267.319
that with them but yeah that's not

2263.599 --> 2269.3590000000004
forcing it out there or not really it's

2267.319 --> 2272.089
just putting it out there and if people

2269.359 --> 2274.459
then think that's worth listening to

2272.089 --> 2277.939
then yeah then I've done something

2274.459 --> 2282.8289999999997
successful and helped other people yeah

2277.939 --> 2287.509
make that choice easier music video gay

2282.829 --> 2289.9990000000003
folks well having not watched any media

2287.509 --> 2292.369
for a very long time and then being

2289.999 --> 2294.109
exposed to that and all the fear porn

2292.369 --> 2297.9790000000003
and spin from Alex Jones

2294.109 --> 2299.959
it was absolutely hilarious yeah it was

2297.979 --> 2302.1499999999996
it takes somebody to put that spin on it

2299.959 --> 2303.109
but prior to it being spun into that

2302.15 --> 2304.7490000000003
song

2303.109 --> 2307.299
I'm saying this because I know you watch

2304.749 --> 2309.9399999999996
Infowars mm-hmm it's gonna just be

2307.299 --> 2313.13
absolutely

2309.94 --> 2315.049
unless only not necessarily hidden to

2313.13 --> 2317.63
most some people just say yeah exchange

2315.049 --> 2318.98
is fear porn but just the people who

2317.63 --> 2320.96
aren't aware of it and I'm not saying

2318.98 --> 2325.029
you're one of them they're just gonna be

2320.96 --> 2325.029
all hearts terrifying the game frogs

2325.66 --> 2330.499
well you know there is a real story

2328.369 --> 2333.98
behind it and just has to do with

2330.499 --> 2337.249
general pharmaceutic activity in the

2333.98 --> 2340.73
world and so there's a real story behind

2337.249 --> 2344.48
it and yeah the gay frogs is kind of

2340.73 --> 2348.47
like that's real but it's also very a

2344.48 --> 2350.63
funny concept just those yeah a gay frog

2348.47 --> 2354.019
it's just it's kind of funny

2350.63 --> 2356.359
it's very meme sensitive and that's why

2354.019 --> 2359.569
he did that probably and yeah it is

2356.359 --> 2362.749
hilarious but it's yeah it's really

2359.569 --> 2364.67
formatted as a meme with some real

2362.749 --> 2367.759
information behind it if you can get

2364.67 --> 2372.16
there if if you can handle the level of

2367.759 --> 2372.16
intensity that comes with Alex Jones

2372.19 --> 2375.589
mm-hmm when you say there's real

2374.21 --> 2379.009
information out there like I say I

2375.589 --> 2385.67
called it a modicum of truth you're

2379.009 --> 2387.829
gonna find a modicum a tiny bit well a

2385.67 --> 2390.89
tiny bit yeah well you can't really

2387.829 --> 2394.029
package giant amounts of truth in simple

2390.89 --> 2396.47
messages that's the whole deal was there

2394.029 --> 2398.42
I'm gonna save 99 percent because I

2396.47 --> 2400.1299999999997
don't know better but the vast majority

2398.42 --> 2402.6800000000003
of the information in the first instance

2400.13 --> 2406.2490000000003
coming somewhere now from the same

2402.68 --> 2409.009
source no I don't think so I think they

2406.249 --> 2411.799
come from people where did Alex Jones

2409.009 --> 2414.109
get the story about gay Fox from the

2411.799 --> 2416.809
mainstream media right he picked it up

2414.109 --> 2419.299
and then he sent research his own crew

2416.809 --> 2420.619
to that location to interact with the

2419.299 --> 2424.67
people that's something that he

2420.619 --> 2427.4
typically really did on camera there's

2424.67 --> 2435.13
there's a bigger story a report about

2427.4 --> 2436.94
that situation all right so yeah there's

2435.13 --> 2439.4
actual

2436.94 --> 2442.01
what is it medical researchers I don't

2439.4 --> 2444.44
know how to regarded it people that do

2442.01 --> 2448.3
study in the field of biology biology

2444.44 --> 2451.67
with laboratory conditions and they

2448.3 --> 2456.17
studied certain types of frogs in a

2451.67 --> 2460.069
certain area that was at the end of a

2456.17 --> 2462.65
sewer system and yet they did find those

2460.069 --> 2466.22
chemicals those gender-bender chemicals

2462.65 --> 2469.369
and the frogs would definitely show the

2466.22 --> 2474.0789999999997
behavioural change making them gay and

2469.369 --> 2476.03
it was on camera they showed it so yeah

2474.079 --> 2478.3390000000004
that's real the thing is that's the

2476.03 --> 2482.6600000000003
weird thing about it so the actual meme

2478.339 --> 2484.91
is just the cherry on top being very in

2482.66 --> 2487.3999999999996
the eye very memorable but there's this

2484.91 --> 2490.94
bigger story below it and that's all

2487.4 --> 2493.329
real well I know you know me well you

2490.94 --> 2495.38
know I'm pretty skeptical generally

2493.329 --> 2497.3590000000004
especially when it comes to video

2495.38 --> 2500.839
production of anything ever however

2497.359 --> 2504.44
you've got an interesting story with men

2500.839 --> 2506.9
in white coats in a building doing what

2504.44 --> 2510.56
they do and then you've got the sewer

2506.9 --> 2512.39
outlet with a videographer presumably

2510.56 --> 2513.56
filming what he says are two male frogs

2512.39 --> 2517.31
humping each other

2513.56 --> 2519.859
Oh silly of that nature now on the show

2517.31 --> 2521.93
this is a claim being made on my show

2519.859 --> 2525.65
what would we do next start with just

2521.93 --> 2528.44
someone planning this well if we'd had

2525.65 --> 2530.9300000000003
our level of approach our level of

2528.44 --> 2532.91
skepticism that we apply to globe

2530.93 --> 2534.98
machinations there yet we would like

2532.91 --> 2537.17
look out that address and then check it

2534.98 --> 2540.89
out for ourselves and figure out who are

2537.17 --> 2543.92
all these individuals and all that to

2540.89 --> 2546.3489999999997
see if it is absolutely real if that is

2543.92 --> 2548.2400000000002
natural and there's no kind of media

2546.349 --> 2549.98
stunts setup going on because yeah

2548.24 --> 2552.7999999999997
there's always that possibility that's

2549.98 --> 2555.319
true it's like a it's like a quantum

2552.8 --> 2557.329
uncertainty situation that's what Alex

2555.319 --> 2560.63
Jones did that's not what we would do

2557.329 --> 2563.9
that's what actually happened according

2560.63 --> 2565.88
to their narrative narrative

2563.9 --> 2567.98
okay would we do on the show someone

2565.88 --> 2569.96
comes on the show and says these

2567.98 --> 2570.289
biologists a producing chemicals they

2569.96 --> 2571.88
spit

2570.289 --> 2574.369
into the system and it's causing the

2571.88 --> 2575.4790000000003
frogs to be gay mm-hmm what would we

2574.369 --> 2578.9590000000003
what would be the next question you

2575.479 --> 2580.7889999999998
would expect well what me to ask well I

2578.959 --> 2583.1299999999997
think that everybody else would probably

2580.789 --> 2589.119
get very silly but I would take it very

2583.13 --> 2591.9790000000003
seriously this causal relationship with

2589.119 --> 2595.13
peppering of sounding like seeming

2591.979 --> 2596.6299999999997
science biologists right well this

2595.13 --> 2598.009
causal relationship we're just we're

2596.63 --> 2600.529
gonna go down there and start looking

2598.009 --> 2601.459
for gay frogs ourselves well you could

2600.529 --> 2603.859
Oh

2601.459 --> 2606.8289999999997
their problem is still out there well we

2603.859 --> 2609.259
could ask for scientific evidence what

2606.829 --> 2610.13
scientific evidence in concerning

2609.259 --> 2612.079
biology

2610.13 --> 2613.5190000000002
yeah but concerning with this

2612.079 --> 2616.6090000000004
cause-and-effect relationship is being

2613.519 --> 2619.2189999999996
asserted all right well so I'm not the

2616.609 --> 2621.259
expert yeah but I think that there is

2619.219 --> 2624.919
look that they didn't just make that

2621.259 --> 2631.069
[Â __Â ] up it has to do with very specific

2624.919 --> 2632.779
type chemicals is so toxic I know this

2631.069 --> 2638.14
isn't didn't get different all of me

2632.779 --> 2641.809
it's toxic that's true themselves

2638.14 --> 2643.609
no you're just asserting it that it's

2641.809 --> 2646.13
all made up no but you're just you're

2643.609 --> 2649.459
just saying no I I didn't get no

2646.13 --> 2653.15
evidence to a level that suffices my

2649.459 --> 2654.499
needs no I'm trying to lead you to do

2653.15 --> 2659.0190000000002
what I would do so you don't get annoyed

2654.499 --> 2661.939
with me I could just say no you to

2659.019 --> 2663.529
inject my skepticism into your own

2661.939 --> 2665.359
narrative rather than me doing you now

2663.529 --> 2672.259
but that's not gonna happen Nathan you

2665.359 --> 2675.049
know that I'm not like Castle same exact

2672.259 --> 2678.049
effect in terms of the speed that you

2675.049 --> 2680.119
can deal with these Plains biologists

2678.049 --> 2681.769
and their cause and effect relationship

2680.119 --> 2686.2690000000002
that's being asserted by way of

2681.769 --> 2688.519
narrative and cinematography right yeah

2686.269 --> 2690.89
but at the same time you're forgetting

2688.519 --> 2693.109
that there is a lot of issues concerning

2690.89 --> 2695.6589999999997
Alex Jones and a lot of people don't

2693.109 --> 2698.569
like him and if he'd literally just

2695.659 --> 2700.5190000000002
faked that [Â __Â ] completely made it up

2698.569 --> 2703.45
yeah there would be a whole horde of

2700.519 --> 2706.29
people then shoving that in here

2703.45 --> 2711.3999999999996
face you forgetting the modicum of truth

2706.29 --> 2712.57
manikin yeah tiny bit yeah right so do

2711.4 --> 2714.55
you think there's nobody out there

2712.57 --> 2717.1600000000003
that's gonna like try to figure that out

2714.55 --> 2719.77
for themselves that do have background

2717.16 --> 2721.45
in biology right so you're saying that

2719.77 --> 2723.7599999999998
the way to go about this is to start

2721.45 --> 2728.52
looking in to the story that's been

2723.76 --> 2731.3500000000004
portrayed and I use story intentionally

2728.52 --> 2734.11
what because this because the story's

2731.35 --> 2735.4
been told why if you haven't been

2734.11 --> 2737.32
exposed to that story you wouldn't give

2735.4 --> 2741.85
two shits about the claim to be gay

2737.32 --> 2744.7000000000003
frogs okay well would you claim or would

2741.85 --> 2746.74
you care if like 20 30 years later

2744.7 --> 2749.7
nothing's done and like everything is

2746.74 --> 2751.87
dead in all that water how about that

2749.7 --> 2754.5699999999997
you just need to scream it on the mic

2751.87 --> 2756.7
into the mic with your hands flat palms

2754.57 --> 2758.98
down on the desk it closer to the mic

2756.7 --> 2760.81
and scream it like Alex Jones and then

2758.98 --> 2764.35
it'll have the desired impact on the are

2760.81 --> 2768.85
we honestly if everything was dead right

2764.35 --> 2771.49
from gave frogs to death but it's just

2768.85 --> 2773.92
one chemical you think it you think it's

2771.49 --> 2775.45
getting less you're never gonna win

2773.92 --> 2776.65
let's change the subjects because you're

2775.45 --> 2779.04
never gonna appeal to me on this line

2776.65 --> 2783.01
ever I'm not trying to appeal an

2779.04 --> 2785.29
appealing to my audience I know if I'm

2783.01 --> 2787.8700000000003
gonna hear if I'm gonna appeal to you

2785.29 --> 2794.5
I'll do it on a one on one because your

2787.87 --> 2798.94
your way to yeah you're like an insect

2794.5 --> 2803.17
you have this arm work skin [Â __Â ] you're

2798.94 --> 2805.66
like a bug Jane bother talking past each

2803.17 --> 2808.2400000000002
other cuz we're mates okay with your

2805.66 --> 2810.22
audience individual points let's have a

2808.24 --> 2812.1099999999997
conversation with each other rather than

2810.22 --> 2815.56
we've reached the point where we will we

2812.11 --> 2819.34
will agree to disagree I hope no it's

2815.56 --> 2824.56
fine now place the truck traps change

2819.34 --> 2826.48
topic yay well you know gay frogs I'm

2824.56 --> 2828.31
totally fine about talking about gay

2826.48 --> 2830.29
frogs my mom's totally fine with gay

2828.31 --> 2832.0299999999997
frogs too those frogs want to be gay I'm

2830.29 --> 2835.5
cool with that yeah you know what the

2832.03 --> 2839.17
ironic thing about it yeah

2835.5 --> 2843.43
like what group on the internet like

2839.17 --> 2845.7400000000002
took on frogs as a as a face

2843.43 --> 2848.2599999999998
representation like the Owen Benjamin

2845.74 --> 2850.87
followers you could say took on the bear

2848.26 --> 2854.55
face there was a group taking on the

2850.87 --> 2857.83
frogs right yes I pay you every school

2854.55 --> 2862.53
now that that's the original meme really

2857.83 --> 2865.27
from France I think but like now in

2862.53 --> 2867.8500000000004
social media groups

2865.27 --> 2873.24
wasn't there a group of people calling

2867.85 --> 2875.98
themselves the frogs it's new to me

2873.24 --> 2881.68
anyway I'd never mind I think I might be

2875.98 --> 2884.32
off here but alright gay frogs yeah

2881.68 --> 2886.12
that's funny song that's the main reason

2884.32 --> 2887.6200000000003
for bringing it up because you know you

2886.12 --> 2893.5
see some a lot the onion just not

2887.62 --> 2898.5099999999998
expecting it though there's even better

2893.5 --> 2900.64
ones like that I like more there's a lot

2898.51 --> 2902.38
of these what's the name again of the

2900.64 --> 2905.98
guy that does that that makes these

2902.38 --> 2908.2000000000003
special very many songs about it no idea

2905.98 --> 2910.72
I didn't ever that might be made that

2908.2 --> 2913.96
song I think I saw it on Brian's Davies

2910.72 --> 2916.72
channel it could be another version but

2913.96 --> 2920.41
Alex Jones plays a lot of memes of

2916.72 --> 2923.5899999999997
himself with a certain type of a music

2920.41 --> 2925.0899999999997
artist and I thought yeah that's cool so

2923.59 --> 2926.01
when someone makes a nasty video like

2925.09 --> 2929.71
that he'll play it

2926.01 --> 2931.84
Ray Ray Ray there's one about I do that

2929.71 --> 2933.82
I'll do that taking ownership that's

2931.84 --> 2936.25
what you do someone says yeah let's say

2933.82 --> 2940.42
boy Thank You flatter spaceman man it's

2936.25 --> 2943.36
plus a Boeing yeah plus I say that word

2940.42 --> 2948.16
again let's say boring it is like let's

2943.36 --> 2949.3900000000003
say Boeing just saves a Boeing listen

2948.16 --> 2954.0
you were don't know what that mean let's

2949.39 --> 2958.69
see Bo in placebo ring yeah well just

2954.0 --> 2960.97
placebo in I just say placebo what we're

2958.69 --> 2962.71
talking about that's like now what that

2960.97 --> 2967.72
is the musician that makes a lot of

2962.71 --> 2968.17
these Alex Jones name songs yeah see all

2967.72 --> 2970.8399999999997
right

2968.17 --> 2975.31
any boy I gotcha but have you ever heard

2970.84 --> 2982.15
the the one where Alex Jones talks about

2975.31 --> 2984.73
Trump going into a goblins nest and with

2982.15 --> 2986.89
the Goblin like smooch with the Goblin

2984.73 --> 2989.8
as long as it doesn't go into bed with a

2986.89 --> 2993.64
goblin I that one so catchy

2989.8 --> 2998.6400000000003
this is and and kind of George related

2993.64 --> 3001.2599999999998
also I didn't any I've lied to me about

2998.64 --> 3003.5099999999998
you're missing out on a lot there's a

3001.26 --> 3007.8900000000003
lot of very funny songs in between Alex

3003.51 --> 3009.48
Jones commercials indirectly so the

3007.89 --> 3012.33
first time I even heard about Alex Jones

3009.48 --> 3015.3
or Thomas Sheridan moaning volume so

3012.33 --> 3016.86
it's like no such thing as bad publicity

3015.3 --> 3020.8500000000004
so somebody saying he's terrible he's

3016.86 --> 3023.2200000000003
bad is this is that like Alex Jones so

3020.85 --> 3025.17
suddenly the names they're saying in

3023.22 --> 3027.48
terms of people who make adverts as I

3025.17 --> 3029.4
call them again taking ownership hate

3027.48 --> 3031.41
it's like you're just getting my name

3029.4 --> 3034.4700000000003
around you think that somehow you're

3031.41 --> 3038.6099999999997
gonna be detrimental to me did you say

3034.47 --> 3039.3599999999997
McNasty well slaves figures bad

3038.61 --> 3041.73
publicity

3039.36 --> 3043.86
long term yeah you might get a few

3041.73 --> 3046.83
cackling witches around your own fire

3043.86 --> 3048.8700000000003
going that's not really gonna have any

3046.83 --> 3052.98
detrimental effect in fact to spread

3048.87 --> 3055.56
your name further alright this is um the

3052.98 --> 3058.71
name of the thing is David Mitchell was

3055.56 --> 3062.7
paid by male moisturizer company called

3058.71 --> 3064.68
bulldog and he was paid to do a moan as

3062.7 --> 3067.2799999999997
he stood up moaning he's on panel shows

3064.68 --> 3070.41
moaning about things long rants

3067.28 --> 3072.1800000000003
seemingly minor things that he'll just

3070.41 --> 3073.47
rant and rant and rant about so they

3072.18 --> 3075.39
paid him to do that and they were going

3073.47 --> 3079.85
to cut it up and you know stick it out

3075.39 --> 3079.85
as as ads and he just ranted about that

3085.16 --> 3089.04
punch it out as adverts even though it

3087.57 --> 3089.88
seemed really detrimental and they're

3089.04 --> 3091.08
paying for it

3089.88 --> 3093.4500000000003
and they're going back to do it again

3091.08 --> 3095.31
you know now bulldogs are reasonably

3093.45 --> 3097.29
well known brands but back then they've

3095.31 --> 3100.29
got no media traction going out and

3097.29 --> 3102.24
trying to get advertising traction is

3100.29 --> 3103.55
impossible tried to do it the South you

3102.24 --> 3107.3999999999996
know it's very very hard

3103.55 --> 3108.75
so yeah doing it in a detrimental way

3107.4 --> 3110.37
that's why I think people aren't too

3108.75 --> 3112.53
many three these days but I used to go

3110.37 --> 3114.2999999999997
on peoples hate commercials for me and

3112.53 --> 3116.4
say thanks for the ad because all you're

3114.3 --> 3117.78
doing is put my name out there wonderful

3116.4 --> 3119.01
doesn't really matter what you say three

3117.78 --> 3120.21
days from now II think the person who

3119.01 --> 3122.55
watches your videos will remember a

3120.21 --> 3125.01
single word you've said no that's not

3122.55 --> 3126.8100000000004
but they might remember my name if in

3125.01 --> 3131.5800000000004
five more times from another few haters

3126.81 --> 3133.17
say go to you I would you get well

3131.58 --> 3136.13
there's a lot of people that really

3133.17 --> 3139.32
don't like me just like with you and

3136.13 --> 3142.23
they hate me even more for associating

3139.32 --> 3144.9300000000003
with you like you you can't imagine how

3142.23 --> 3147.33
many trolls just on a regular base try

3144.93 --> 3149.64
to convince me to step away from you

3147.33 --> 3162.3199999999997
then everything will be glorious like

3149.64 --> 3162.3199999999997
that kind of [Â __Â ] seriously it's like

3162.35 --> 3170.61
just can't handle it same goes for

3168.99 --> 3173.4599999999996
anteus try to reach the point now are

3170.61 --> 3175.59
actually insulting any knows it's being

3173.46 --> 3177.75
done in that kind of I'm actually

3175.59 --> 3179.73
leading off him and the way he does

3177.75 --> 3184.2
things so it was explained to me once by

3179.73 --> 3186.21
Anthony so I don't often think but you

3184.2 --> 3187.56
insult you mate and call him a dick and

3186.21 --> 3188.88
all the rest of it and that's that's

3187.56 --> 3191.31
your way putting your arm around him

3188.88 --> 3194.9100000000003
according to Anthony with people aren't

3191.31 --> 3197.16
Ian like okay so this makes no sense

3194.91 --> 3199.2
okay I've been trained okay because I

3197.16 --> 3201.6299999999997
actually call Randy a dick because I

3199.2 --> 3206.7
really think he is a dick just for the

3201.63 --> 3220.59
record until you're not actually annoyed

3206.7 --> 3222.4199999999996
with him no I'm there and then plugged

3220.59 --> 3224.4300000000003
you in plug dude and then 20 minutes

3222.42 --> 3226.26
after you I lose in the chat but you

3224.43 --> 3228.24
know when he got there a much easier now

3226.26 --> 3229.6800000000003
it's all shirt and then I'm like you

3228.24 --> 3231.8999999999996
know he's not as bad as everyone says

3229.68 --> 3233.069
how many joking he is actually a massive

3231.9 --> 3234.989
wanker

3233.069 --> 3237.63
it's not not done with the stain because

3234.989 --> 3239.2490000000003
I'm never up to the point where I know

3237.63 --> 3242.1600000000003
that actually you're taking is affection

3239.249 --> 3244.3799999999997
if I call him a wanker when I'm not

3242.16 --> 3246.6299999999997
angry with so that's kind of the weird

3244.38 --> 3248.88
psychology with with runty but

3246.63 --> 3251.339
ultimately speaking even run to you kind

3248.88 --> 3254.9990000000003
of a fairly equal level in that regard

3251.339 --> 3258.3289999999997
basically faults call their faults but

3254.999 --> 3260.8799999999997
you're basically good guys so I mean

3258.329 --> 3263.279
it's one of those where you know how

3260.88 --> 3265.199
people earlier on the show and I was

3263.279 --> 3267.299
trying to get you to be skeptical rather

3265.199 --> 3271.079
than just say no because that'll piss

3267.299 --> 3272.489
you off right not intentionally do

3271.079 --> 3277.799
things that are going to piss you off

3272.489 --> 3279.779
ranting because he likes pushing

3277.799 --> 3281.16
people's buttons but that's just run T

3279.779 --> 3283.829
doesn't make them a bad person it just

3281.16 --> 3286.8799999999997
makes you a bit of a dick you know some

3283.829 --> 3290.2490000000003
people wouldn't even call that fault

3286.88 --> 3294.2090000000003
yeah but I just I don't like dealing

3290.249 --> 3297.9289999999996
with that [Â __Â ] because it it clouds my

3294.209 --> 3300.239
judgment also I don't like it doesn't go

3297.929 --> 3302.2490000000003
it's like really detrimental to me when

3300.239 --> 3305.219
people do that even if they think it's

3302.249 --> 3307.3799999999997
just a joke you know when I actually

3305.219 --> 3309.809
when we have a history when we're kind

3307.38 --> 3310.679
of colleagues you know Charles do that

3309.809 --> 3312.449
[Â __Â ] all the time

3310.679 --> 3314.489
but with Randi it's just difficult

3312.449 --> 3316.919
especially because he kind of is

3314.489 --> 3325.169
manifested he does his thing he has his

3316.919 --> 3328.259
credit and yeah I don't know yeah we'll

3325.169 --> 3331.259
do it anyway that's just that's just

3328.259 --> 3333.299
character there's lots of things about

3331.259 --> 3333.959
with that character that make them very

3333.299 --> 3336.809
endearing

3333.959 --> 3345.509
you know either is it as much as this

3336.809 --> 3346.829
might sound in the same way I'm sure you

3345.509 --> 3348.539
could least them to be a very negative

3346.829 --> 3350.2490000000003
character or a same way we could spin

3348.539 --> 3351.0890000000004
right grantie that way and me and

3350.249 --> 3354.419
anybody else

3351.089 --> 3358.589
everybody's got their faults he is

3354.419 --> 3363.689
actually a guy I wouldn't call that good

3358.589 --> 3366.87
I would call that natural enough human

3363.689 --> 3369.75
enough you know he's not a

3366.87 --> 3372.87
truly evil person but he has bad

3369.75 --> 3374.73
tendencies and he embraces them and

3372.87 --> 3378.21
that's just wrong you can't call that

3374.73 --> 3380.93
good because even though he is still a

3378.21 --> 3384.57
natural person and he has feelings

3380.93 --> 3386.1
definitely you know everyone's got their

3384.57 --> 3388.29
thoughts that's a negative connotation

3386.1 --> 3389.91
opposite world you know and when you

3388.29 --> 3393.69
point these folks out to royalty he will

3389.91 --> 3398.94
laugh about them act like psychoanalyze

3393.69 --> 3407.43
ranty he's a good guy overall mm 51

3398.94 --> 3410.64
percent easily yeah sorry it's just too

3407.43 --> 3414.81
much history for me I you know he is

3410.64 --> 3417.54
what he is and you know I'll I'd love to

3414.81 --> 3421.97
have peace among us but I can't really

3417.54 --> 3424.91
trust him anymore I just can write off

3421.97 --> 3432.0299999999997
he's recently stabbed you there ugly so

3424.91 --> 3435.5099999999998
yeah yeah I'm still getting trolled with

3432.03 --> 3438.21
that [Â __Â ] specifically with George that

3435.51 --> 3441.7200000000003
did that and that's like thanks ranty

3438.21 --> 3444.3
know his little jokes have fast

3441.72 --> 3447.48
consequences on what I deal with so he's

3444.3 --> 3448.25
literally getting in my face against my

3447.48 --> 3451.17
will

3448.25 --> 3455.61
influencing the landscape around me with

3451.17 --> 3471.29
his jokes okay and it's not appreciated

3455.61 --> 3471.29
really it isn't right so whatever

3471.96 --> 3480.96
I now really know what to do about it

3474.089 --> 3481.47
anyway best off coming out in five

3480.96 --> 3485.16
minutes

3481.47 --> 3487.7099999999996
know what the for the main channel

3485.16 --> 3490.109
audience on nineteen eighty what I'm

3487.71 --> 3491.25
gonna do on a Sunday from now on at the

3490.109 --> 3494.5499999999997
usual time

3491.25 --> 3497.88
two o'clock five minutes um it's about

3494.55 --> 3500.1600000000003
whichever of the the after shows of the

3497.88 --> 3501.839
previous six shows so Monday to Saturday

3500.16 --> 3503.97
whichever was the best I have to show

3501.839 --> 3506.19
I'm filling that out together Sunday

3503.97 --> 3509.3689999999997
obviously far more people subscribe to

3506.19 --> 3510.66
the main channel and therefore fairly

3509.369 --> 3513.78
high likelihood that they haven't seen

3510.66 --> 3515.79
them like today's his balloon satellites

3513.78 --> 3517.9500000000003
starts off with the dude coming in

3515.79 --> 3519.54
talking about Earth the heliocentric

3517.95 --> 3529.3489999999997
system of Earth being a closed system

3519.54 --> 3531.27
remember that remember that I don't know

3529.349 --> 3536.2200000000003
if I remember that I'll definitely

3531.27 --> 3539.97
listen to it sorry three minutes right

3536.22 --> 3542.0099999999998
but I do still go for an hour well and

3539.97 --> 3544.6189999999997
now we're after there's not necessarily

3542.01 --> 3546.96
you know it's been a pretty good show as

3544.619 --> 3551.869
it's great to have a you on as a guest

3546.96 --> 3551.869
and have this elaborate conversation and

3560.54 --> 3566.55
ask his missus make them watch me a gem

3563.91 --> 3569.06
a gem is like their own out of control

3566.55 --> 3574.32
it's been like that for over a week

3569.06 --> 3576.5099999999998
hey James cool mm-hmm okay Chad on the

3574.32 --> 3580.6400000000003
track few times I know I remember his

3576.51 --> 3584.42
voice I think I had him on my show even

3580.64 --> 3588.46
but it's variance is fair interest Bible

3584.42 --> 3590.83
yeah but he's a

3588.46 --> 3593.23
don't want to shame him any further you

3590.83 --> 3596.7999999999997
know I've talked about it enough but

3593.23 --> 3604.03
it's just out of control and it's really

3596.8 --> 3607.3590000000004
getting on my nerves we said do you

3604.03 --> 3611.2900000000004
still go for an hour Nathan

3607.359 --> 3613.39

3611.29 --> 3617.23
that's him he starts at 1:00 finishes it

3613.39 --> 3620.2599999999998
to go for an hour you make your manager

3617.23 --> 3626.859
some sort of sexual perverted punt hm

3620.26 --> 3629.8590000000004

3633.58 --> 3638.89
I'm at a 45 or 50 minutes or something

3636.82 --> 3642.31

3638.89 --> 3644.29
on Saturdays I do have longer shows from

3642.31 --> 3646.42
