[Music]

39.3 --> 47.41
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.36 --> 49.93
early-bird number 184 I'm your host

47.41 --> 51.94
Arwen and before we start the show

49.93 --> 55.96
please don't forget to share it any

51.94 --> 57.79
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

55.96 --> 59.44
already subscribed to my channel and hit

57.79 --> 61.719
the bell notifications so you know when

59.44 --> 66.039
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

61.719 --> 71.619
p.m. Amsterdam time so today the weather

66.039 --> 76.8
is quite exquisite and yeah I had a

71.619 --> 80.11
great time just before this just cycling

76.8 --> 82.44
outside there is still some chemtrails

80.11 --> 85.929
but currently not so much see there's

82.44 --> 89.44
one plane flying over there it's not

85.929 --> 91.569
leaving anything except a contrail which

89.44 --> 94.27
dissipates really quickly which is what

91.569 --> 97.96000000000001
contrails do there's still some blur

94.27 --> 101.439
over there so it's not been kept real

97.96 --> 103.869
free but much less and it's almost

101.439 --> 108.46
completely cloudless beside the

103.869 --> 110.32
chemtrails it's really warm today it

108.46 --> 114.29899999999999
really feels like somewhere it's awesome

110.32 --> 117.03899999999999
and the birds are all fully at it

114.299 --> 118.619
there's this tiny little bird there

117.039 --> 122.92
right did you see that

118.619 --> 126.039
and it made a nest like inside of a hole

122.92 --> 128.709
in the brick wall at the window side

126.039 --> 132.489
right there underneath the underneath

128.709 --> 134.38
the side of the roof roof and it's so

132.489 --> 137.62
awesome that it's gonna even fit through

134.38 --> 140.019
there and it's going in and out and in

137.62 --> 145.39000000000001
and out constantly feeding worms and

140.019 --> 148.72
bugs in the city there was a spot where

145.39 --> 151.66
lavender was blossoming and that thing

148.72 --> 154.81
was just loaded with bees I wish I could

151.66 --> 156.51
have filmed it looked so awesome and

154.81 --> 159.39000000000001
they were having a great time just

156.51 --> 163.069
hopping from flower to flower and

159.39 --> 165.17
bumping into each other even was

163.069 --> 169.099
awesome good to see that they're still

165.17 --> 173.07899999999998
alive oh also bees of all kinds it could

169.099 --> 173.07899999999998
identify at least three different types

173.59 --> 180.31
big ones and the smaller ones and like

180.549 --> 187.59900000000002
mixture in color and some that were kind

183.62 --> 192.53
of darker almost brownish weren't so

187.599 --> 199.459
yeah I don't know bees bees of all kinds

192.53 --> 202.76
love bees so let's see who's in chat see

199.459 --> 209.03
a lot of people here how's my volume by

202.76 --> 211.189
the way I opted it significantly I think

209.03 --> 214.549
I may just need to do that because

211.189 --> 216.85899999999998
otherwise yeah with the old mic kind of

214.549 --> 222.37900000000002
work but with this one yeah there's more

216.859 --> 226.969
but more boss bass coming through but

222.379 --> 229.849
still like I constantly need to up my

226.969 --> 232.72899999999998
own voice even to be audible on the

229.849 --> 237.07899999999998
previous volume and now it should be

232.729 --> 244.34
much better I you know OBS I actually

237.079 --> 249.729
put it at 180 right before it was 150

244.34 --> 252.949
standard so it's loud loud enough

249.729 --> 259.15000000000003
hopefully more to par with other YouTube

252.949 --> 259.15000000000003
videos so let's again let's use in chat

259.79 --> 265.87
lots of people Pete Mars came in earlier

262.76 --> 270.11
X 320 with loss and good to see you

265.87 --> 272.81
stairs Moretz James Mason sleeping

270.11 --> 279.85
warrior good morning Daniel

272.81 --> 279.85
over moco Nathan Oakley 90-80 Steve

281.05 --> 290.38
misty cockney tea

283.78 --> 290.38
the Omega where tea Brandon cook

293.79 --> 296.45000000000005
right

298.26 --> 303.96999999999997
yeah yeah James Mason I have actually

302.17 --> 306.21000000000004
heard of bee sting therapy it's very

303.97 --> 309.25
interesting because be poison has a

306.21 --> 312.37
unique property but you don't actually

309.25 --> 318.48
need to be stung by bees to get the

312.37 --> 321.79
effect there is actually a cream with it

318.48 --> 324.13
and you can just rub that on and has the

321.79 --> 326.29
same effect you don't have to like have

324.13 --> 332.14
a painful spot on your arm or wherever

326.29 --> 336.3
you're going to do that so yeah it's

332.14 --> 336.3
weird how that works but yes it does

344.03 --> 356.96999999999997
topically that is mostly even yet these

349.68 --> 359.58
things are usually oh we have almost not

356.97 --> 362.52000000000004
even subdermal e and that pretty much

359.58 --> 364.10999999999996
hits the target area although yeah in a

362.52 --> 368.47999999999996
- bit of a high of a concentration

364.11 --> 377.52000000000004
really over time if you treated right

368.48 --> 378.93
yeah and not too much anyway I'm gonna

377.52 --> 379.66999999999996
do the same thing today as I did

378.93 --> 383.55
yesterday

379.67 --> 386.36
because I kind of liked it I'm gonna do

383.55 --> 390.87
it live so I'm gonna take a brain force

386.36 --> 396.96000000000004
open up the capsule replace it because

390.87 --> 400.95
this capsule is kind of handy because

396.96 --> 402.71999999999997
then I'm gonna put this into it which

400.95 --> 407.25
yeah I could just take a spoon of this

402.72 --> 410.16
stuff but I don't know I it's not that

407.25 --> 414.84
great a taste but it's that the best

410.16 --> 418.14000000000004
thing to basically replacing the infobar

414.84 --> 422.82
store product product at that with just

418.14 --> 426.77
a regular organic supermarket quality of

422.82 --> 430.05
curcuminoids so i'm gonna open this up

426.77 --> 433.03999999999996
man how did i open it up previous time

430.05 --> 433.04
went so easily

434.729 --> 447.78
yeah just flip it off all right

442.53 --> 451.9
and it's pretty solid it's not even yet

447.78 --> 457.29999999999995
it's compressed powder all kinds of

451.9 --> 461.19
stuff already ingredients by the way if

457.3 --> 461.19
you're interested in what's really in it

472.66 --> 485.96000000000004
anyway this is a nootropic so it's not

478.64 --> 488.12
really a drug but it does enhance yeah

485.96 --> 489.77
cognitive abilities and that's a very

488.12 --> 493.85
interested yeah that's why it's a

489.77 --> 496.69
nootropic I forgot a spoon let me go get

493.85 --> 496.69
one be right back

525.76 --> 532.58
they had this stuff is not really salah

529.07 --> 539.59
ball it doesn't really naturally

532.58 --> 543.5200000000001
dissolve i read the ingredients is it

539.59 --> 543.52
alright so what is in this

548.21 --> 553.75
okay there's B vitamin b6 in it as

554.56 --> 564.02
pyridoxine HC I know what that's b12

561.05 --> 569.0889999999999
methylcobalamin there's someone that

564.02 --> 573.11
just yeah the micrograms are differ

569.089 --> 581.6600000000001
greatly anyway but Koba herb extracts

573.11 --> 586.1
alpha GPC that is closer real phos for

581.66 --> 591.25
real chlorine right okay

586.1 --> 591.25
yerba mate a leaf powder theobromine

591.85 --> 604.9590000000001
force fatty deal sarin l-theanine black

599.209 --> 609.41
pepper fruit extract and hooper zine a

604.959 --> 611.9799999999999
from tooth to club moss aerial parts

609.41 --> 616.75
extract right sounds kind of complicated

611.98 --> 619.94
lots of stuff and so very chemical

616.75 --> 624.35
sounding but it's I'm pretty sure it is

619.94 --> 626.5400000000001
all derived from plants and probably

624.35 --> 629.9590000000001
chemically worked on a little here and

626.54 --> 632.8299999999999
there to isolate things but anyway I

629.959 --> 635.5999999999999
tried it yesterday and felt great and I

632.83 --> 638.6600000000001
didn't have any really negative side

635.6 --> 640.94
effects that I felt off although the

638.66 --> 643.43
weird thing is I did in the aftermath

640.94 --> 645.589
have a little bad side effects from the

643.43 --> 649.31
cannabis yeah I kind of tried a

645.589 --> 654.1300000000001
different type and the guy from the shop

649.31 --> 659.65
already warned me that it would be more

654.13 --> 663.13
experienced mentally and I did and yeah

659.65 --> 669.31
today I didn't get that type of weed so

663.13 --> 673.329
I should get a more clear unintended

669.31 --> 673.329
experience of it so Cheers

673.62 --> 675.65
ah

677.09 --> 685.58
and I love organic orange juice anyway

680.27 --> 685.5799999999999
so good mmm

687.119 --> 702.4590000000001
right so there's still clumps in there

690.209 --> 705.1189999999999
no just gonna barely tastes like

702.459 --> 711.189
anything like the that stuff that clump

705.119 --> 723.97
no I don't know it's it's not super

711.189 --> 727.899
bitter or anything right yeah I can

723.97 --> 731.619
immediately kind of feel that hit it

727.899 --> 734.079
kind of hits almost like when you're

731.619 --> 737.649
really thirsty it's really sunny and you

734.079 --> 741.3689999999999
take like a really nice sip off not too

737.649 --> 743.29
cold but kind of cold super good quality

741.369 --> 746.23
water you know you hit it back it's like

743.29 --> 749.23
oh that feeling that's kind of the

746.23 --> 753.309
feeling sensation that I'm getting from

749.23 --> 757.509
it's interesting it really does pick you

753.309 --> 760.6
up and also I did completely take it in

757.509 --> 764.049
one hit and not just subtly it's

760.6 --> 773.0400000000001
interesting so let's fill that capsule

764.049 --> 777.639
with yellowroot Curcuma for the cabin

773.04 --> 780.189
lights for the cooker humanoids as it

777.639 --> 782.35
were and others because alex jones

780.189 --> 784.379
always likes to say oh his product has

782.35 --> 788.529
the highest curcuma noise level

784.379 --> 791.259
percentage thingy and yeah that is kind

788.529 --> 791.919
of proven in the study to be very

791.259 --> 795.85
special

791.919 --> 801.999
but there's more properties to this

795.85 --> 806.47
stuff than just that and yeah mike adams

801.999 --> 809.589
did get into that a little in the

806.47 --> 812.5790000000001
beginning as a side note but i'm kind of

809.589 --> 815.0790000000001
interested to get a more full-scale

812.579 --> 816.8599999999999
oversight of what this herb can actually

815.079 --> 821.63
do

816.86 --> 825.23
and yeah what can you do with it

821.63 --> 828.98
especially if you combine it so see now

825.23 --> 835.4300000000001
I got a solid capsule this suit should

828.98 --> 840.44
be like a decent spoon full basically in

835.43 --> 846.53
the capsule that henceforth contain

840.44 --> 848.5600000000001
brain force and I'm gonna take this as

846.53 --> 848.56
well

858.16 --> 879.24
ah yep there's no drugs here

866.16 --> 884.11
there's only nutraceuticals again it's

879.24 --> 886.379
nutraceuticals and I forgot the name

884.11 --> 889.509
stupid anyway

886.379 --> 892.0
no drugs it's officially not classified

889.509 --> 894.61
as drugs otherwise it couldn't have had

892.0 --> 897.75
to just shipped here through the customs

894.61 --> 900.339
because they did definitely check it I

897.75 --> 901.93
have to pay for it every time something

900.339 --> 906.4300000000001
gets shipped over here from the United

901.93 --> 908.7589999999999
States really annoying but yeah it's

906.43 --> 915.6389999999999
probably even gonna get worse now

908.759 --> 918.129
thank you troll or maybe not with Europe

915.639 --> 920.04
I don't know there certainly seems to be

918.129 --> 926.62
a lot of friction now in the markets oh

920.04 --> 929.649
yeah yeah I don't know I was pretty

926.62 --> 932.829
shocked to hear yesterday like I noticed

929.649 --> 936.43
life from lift a veil that one of his

932.829 --> 939.6389999999999
guests that kind of really did draw

936.43 --> 943.81
attention to his channel also because he

939.639 --> 951.3290000000001
had an all Hollywood actor as a side

943.81 --> 951.329
actor like I say oops

956.37 --> 962.089
an extra like in series and stuff and

962.54 --> 968.42
yeah he had him on and he talked about

965.459 --> 972.209
pedophilia stuff and the guy yeah he

968.42 --> 975.079
apparently so they say committed suicide

972.209 --> 978.059
that was pretty shocking to hear and

975.079 --> 980.459
yeah Nathan stellt incompletely went

978.059 --> 983.42
into that the entire thing was pretty

980.459 --> 988.0189999999999
freaky and he had the really weird

983.42 --> 991.3499999999999
letter really really weird letter it's

988.019 --> 996.149
just yeah the whole thing was highly

991.35 --> 999.149
suspicious and just strange but the guy

996.149 --> 1001.819
was kind of weird though I always felt

999.149 --> 1007.249
like oh really while this guy seems kind

1001.819 --> 1010.8789999999999
of like on the edge of the danger zone

1007.249 --> 1016.339
as it were so I can't completely rule it

1010.879 --> 1018.3190000000001
out but it is still freaky and yeah if

1016.339 --> 1020.269
you just watch that hangout that it's

1018.319 --> 1024.8899999999999
just weird his letter was just weird

1020.269 --> 1028.299
anyway what's his in death that's really

1024.89 --> 1032.6200000000001
sloppy let me find the guy's name again

1028.299 --> 1032.62
should at least mention his name

1037.21 --> 1047.32
right capi I sack Cappy anyway that

1045.07 --> 1057.87
apparently happened he jumped off a

1047.32 --> 1060.6399999999999
bridge so they say but yeah he was a a

1057.87 --> 1063.58
witness an outspoken witness about

1060.64 --> 1066.15
pedophilia and Hollywood so that makes

1063.58 --> 1071.1399999999999
it highly suspicious of course

1066.15 --> 1072.2800000000002
so it's freaky anyway that happened and

1071.14 --> 1078.0300000000002
of course

1072.28 --> 1082.48
yeah Randy's grantees Mareth marathon

1078.03 --> 1086.6499999999999
grantee o'them for his drone and that

1082.48 --> 1090.34
really man you eventually ended up over

1086.65 --> 1094.39
half what he needed just one go it's

1090.34 --> 1097.05
pretty impressive and it was a fun hang

1094.39 --> 1097.0500000000002
out to be yet

1101.49 --> 1104.21
okay

1105.11 --> 1108.53
yeah misty cockney tea by the way I

1106.94 --> 1113.3600000000001
don't know exactly what the temperature

1108.53 --> 1115.91
is I could I guess I could look it up on

1113.36 --> 1126.26
Google because I don't have a

1115.91 --> 1130.5400000000002
thermometer here so okay it's apparently

1126.26 --> 1130.54
70 degrees Celsius here

1140.75 --> 1147.88
and that's 60 degrees Fahrenheit

1143.99 --> 1147.88
just for the record anyway

1151.12 --> 1154.31
[Music]

1158.51 --> 1165.04
now not 7 degrees Celsius no that's

1162.41 --> 1165.0400000000002
ridiculous

1170.12 --> 1173.1399999999999
Oh God

1189.53 --> 1198.72
all right all right okay yeah

1193.86 --> 1202.4399999999998
Disney lots of Hollywood stuff there's

1198.72 --> 1206.82
so much hidden weird [ __ ] in between

1202.44 --> 1211.77
their movies many of them and it's not

1206.82 --> 1216.9299999999998
just Disney it's all over the place it's

1211.77 --> 1222.06
just it's just a sneaky little thing

1216.93 --> 1224.91
that they like to do try to to try to

1222.06 --> 1230.22
secretly convince everyone that that

1224.91 --> 1233.49
yeah pedophilia and being anti human

1230.22 --> 1237.99
eventually it is pretty much at the

1233.49 --> 1241.68
roots of the extremist anti-human agenda

1237.99 --> 1245.8700000000001
basically they are definitely a part of

1241.68 --> 1249.0
that and now even today obviously so

1245.87 --> 1251.9399999999998
their attitudes and everything their

1249.0 --> 1254.75
hatred for Christianity in general so

1251.94 --> 1254.75
it's very obvious

1261.96 --> 1268.47
all right so anyway let's get back to

1264.889 --> 1273.09
Flat Earth or something because that is

1268.47 --> 1278.8790000000001
in the title after all if anyone wants

1273.09 --> 1281.509
to join by the way they can through sky

1278.879 --> 1281.509
preferably

1303.49 --> 1311.88
all right

1306.33 --> 1321.3899999999999
I am an Aries 106 earlier asked about

1311.88 --> 1325.2
the situation with ice a copy deck it's

1321.39 --> 1329.21
not crisis well I haven't seen a corpse

1325.2 --> 1332.28
he's been reported dead I have no idea

1329.21 --> 1334.41
no idea didn't even like oh I'm gonna

1332.28 --> 1336.6
now search on the internet for news

1334.41 --> 1340.17
articles relating to him now I just took

1336.6 --> 1344.3999999999999
note of it it's at least report it to be

1340.17 --> 1349.95
so I don't know I don't know I haven't

1344.4 --> 1360.3300000000002
seen a mortgage report or anything more

1349.95 --> 1365.16
reports I mean so I don't know it's

1360.33 --> 1368.49
probably real but there are still

1365.16 --> 1371.67
suspicions again like it did he really

1368.49 --> 1373.74
do that or was he like blackmail to do

1371.67 --> 1378.93
that or did somebody just shove him off

1373.74 --> 1383.49
that bridge so I don't know I have no

1378.93 --> 1386.13
idea we'll we'll find out as it always

1383.49 --> 1392.01
happens it's always people onto that

1386.13 --> 1396.3200000000002
stuff so who knows I'll keep you updated

1392.01 --> 1396.32
about it if I learn anything new

1409.06 --> 1417.6699999999998
a weird question Colin Turner I a

1415.42 --> 1421.95
southern store I don't think so

1417.67 --> 1421.95
there's the suppose at Southern Cross

1422.19 --> 1433.0
but there seems to be no star at the a

1428.26 --> 1443.8799999999999
parents access point of the globe of the

1433.0 --> 1443.88
heavens so I don't know I don't think so

1455.909 --> 1467.009
yep oh cool politics is all over it it's

1459.539 --> 1472.199
politics media and Hollywood and secret

1467.009 --> 1474.809
services it's it yeah a deep state it's

1472.199 --> 1478.469
not a deep state if it doesn't if it can

1474.809 --> 1483.389
completely function under the radar as

1478.469 --> 1485.929
so as many groups involved in that so

1483.389 --> 1485.9289999999999
yeah

1497.46 --> 1508.8400000000001
and it's all branched out through Europe

1500.559 --> 1513.49
obviously and wherever America gets a

1508.84 --> 1515.639
hand into things pretty much they get

1513.49 --> 1515.639
the chance

1526.789 --> 1536.8799999999999
yeah okay good point : Turner it it's

1531.48 --> 1539.549
just it's a yeah it is kind of Cosmo

1536.88 --> 1543.24
Jeannie related I guess but it's pretty

1539.549 --> 1547.11
obvious like okay no everyone kind of

1543.24 --> 1550.799
knows that there is no central southern

1547.11 --> 1552.9289999999999
star so why would you ask me that even

1550.799 --> 1555.84
though he had the subject is related

1552.929 --> 1558.1100000000001
indeed that's what I thought was weird

1555.84 --> 1558.11
about it

1569.93 --> 1579.77
alright I'm not Arwen by the way thank

1575.33 --> 1583.34
you the Omega where t but yes my point

1579.77 --> 1588.32
that that is about the the supposed

1583.34 --> 1590.86
proof of axial rotation through the ring

1588.32 --> 1592.1
laser gyroscope was it or the other one

1590.86 --> 1598.8799999999999
yep

1592.1 --> 1602.4499999999998
because it's only gonna rotate yeah

1598.88 --> 1604.3400000000001
in relation on the axis directly

1602.45 --> 1607.48
pointing at the center point of the

1604.34 --> 1611.3
earth supposedly pretty supposedly right

1607.48 --> 1615.05
but that's not proving the rotation of

1611.3 --> 1617.33
the earth because it's like with the

1615.05 --> 1619.9099999999999
gyroscope what supposedly does is stay

1617.33 --> 1627.5
in place so it should be rotating

1619.91 --> 1632.21
diagonally and it didn't it rotated

1627.5 --> 1634.58
directly on the axis to the center point

1632.21 --> 1636.5900000000001
of the presupposed spherical earth and

1634.58 --> 1640.03
that doesn't make any sense unless

1636.59 --> 1643.27
you're on the North or the South Pole so

1640.03 --> 1647.05
yeah thank you for taking notice of that

1643.27 --> 1647.05
the Omega where T

1648.59 --> 1657.069
[Music]

1668.06 --> 1671.609
[Music]

1693.54 --> 1699.7
yeah indeed indeed it does

1696.79 --> 1702.1
Theo maker worthy or you could just say

1699.7 --> 1706.23
it doesn't actually correlate to in a

1702.1 --> 1709.33
literal physical rotation of the

1706.23 --> 1712.35
presuppose spherical earth that's

1709.33 --> 1712.35
another way of putting it

1723.25 --> 1731.559
how God Europe [ __ ] the I don't know

1728.789 --> 1734.83
I I don't know what I'm gonna do with

1731.559 --> 1737.59
that I might just check it out and end

1734.83 --> 1741.8999999999999
up not voting after all after taking a

1737.59 --> 1741.8999999999999
look at it all I don't know

1768.57 --> 1771.57
right

1798.61 --> 1806.11
all right yeah I have to I have to agree

1802.63 --> 1809.17
kind of because the government's here

1806.11 --> 1811.83
and across Europe are just fooling

1809.17 --> 1816.67
around almost Netherlands especially

1811.83 --> 1819.809
it's all theater and just fooling around

1816.67 --> 1823.54
pretending to do the right thing and

1819.809 --> 1824.59
also determining what that supposedly is

1823.54 --> 1830.47
for everyone

1824.59 --> 1834.3999999999999
it's very patronizing what I do it's

1830.47 --> 1842.65
politics and like treating everyone like

1834.4 --> 1846.5800000000002
children almost so at that I agree

1842.65 --> 1850.39
voting yeah there's it all depends

1846.58 --> 1854.59
really on the people what they're gonna

1850.39 --> 1857.1100000000001
be like once they actually hit the

1854.59 --> 1865.1499999999999
function can they make a difference is

1857.11 --> 1867.52
it even technically possible and if at

1865.15 --> 1870.5800000000002
some point there it can be a difference

1867.52 --> 1875.95
made and I'm pretty sure of it then I

1870.58 --> 1878.02
might be seduced to vote indeed and

1875.95 --> 1883.809
there are still kind of groups out there

1878.02 --> 1886.03
that I do agree with especially the

1883.809 --> 1890.23
groups that are just specialized in

1886.03 --> 1892.33
certain regions that really focus on

1890.23 --> 1894.49
specific subjects those are the most

1892.33 --> 1896.6789999999999
reliable because they really stick to

1894.49 --> 1898.27
what they do and that's what they want

1896.679 --> 1900.46
to improve and that's good that that's

1898.27 --> 1903.52
very functional those type of parties

1900.46 --> 1908.679
there's there's plenty of those in the

1903.52 --> 1913.09
Netherlands but there's also groups that

1908.679 --> 1914.6100000000001
are borderline deranged at it I tend to

1913.09 --> 1920.07
go into

1914.61 --> 1924.8
weird Marxist type of yeah overly

1920.07 --> 1924.8
socialist approach it's the

1930.1 --> 1938.26
I'll just see what happens really

1934.56 --> 1941.35
and again if I'm if I feel called from

1938.26 --> 1943.42
the other side to do it because it will

1941.35 --> 1945.4599999999998
make a difference then I will do it but

1943.42 --> 1948.16
at this point I feel like it's just a

1945.46 --> 1955.63
giant mess and it needs to fester on

1948.16 --> 1961.66
more you know really that let it all

1955.63 --> 1964.63
become more blatant more obvious let the

1961.66 --> 1972.3100000000002
grass roots build some momentum to

1964.63 --> 1979.3300000000002
really displace it tip it's a push it

1972.31 --> 1981.96
off the throne as it were and we'll just

1979.33 --> 1981.96
see what happens

1996.59 --> 1999.6899999999998
[Music]

2008.23 --> 2013.84
they build roads and stuff well it's

2011.71 --> 2016.48
actually corporations that build roads

2013.84 --> 2020.1689999999999
and the corporations only need funding

2016.48 --> 2022.1200000000001
and if the public could truly have

2020.169 --> 2024.279
control over the budget of how

2022.12 --> 2027.4599999999998
everything was spent instead of letting

2024.279 --> 2030.76
that to a bunch of you know what's at

2027.46 --> 2034.69
the top that just fool around with

2030.76 --> 2038.25
everything then yeah sure the public can

2034.69 --> 2038.25
pay for that absolutely

2043.15 --> 2046.279
[Music]

2046.58 --> 2054.54
we don't need government look government

2049.5 --> 2060.23
is just a central point through which we

2054.54 --> 2060.23
organize these things that make society

2060.89 --> 2068.49
but you can decentralize things make it

2065.25 --> 2071.429
more open and dynamic through for

2068.49 --> 2076.7099999999996
example an internet democracy as it was

2071.429 --> 2080.82
conceptualized and tried out in in

2076.71 --> 2086.55
Iceland for a while and it worked pretty

2080.82 --> 2089.13
good and there's not going to be

2086.55 --> 2092.1000000000004
complaints from people because they have

2089.13 --> 2094.679
become the government so the only

2092.1 --> 2097.29
complaint there could arrive is that

2094.679 --> 2101.07
it's not functioning and it was it was

2097.29 --> 2104.94
functioning unfortunately yeah the

2101.07 --> 2108.51
political aspect it became kind of

2104.94 --> 2109.86
leftist is what I understood so it was

2108.51 --> 2116.5200000000004
kind of toned back and that's

2109.86 --> 2120.23
unfortunate but it was very interesting

2116.52 --> 2125.48
to me at the time in like around 2010

2120.23 --> 2128.16
was very interesting period in Iceland

2125.48 --> 2131.13
was also the first time on the Alex Dion

2128.16 --> 2134.58
show that I think that even the current

2131.13 --> 2139.9500000000003
the ex Prime Minister back then from the

2134.58 --> 2142.95
pirate party that did this that they

2139.95 --> 2146.1299999999997
came on Alex Jones Show and basically

2142.95 --> 2149.58
told him yeah there America never went

2146.13 --> 2152.12
to the moon that was fake it's like the

2149.58 --> 2157.3199999999997
first time I heard anything like that

2152.12 --> 2159.54
and Alex was totally shocked I really

2157.32 --> 2161.4300000000003
didn't know what to say because he

2159.54 --> 2165.42
thought he had like an ally in front of

2161.43 --> 2167.0699999999997
him and suddenly it's like what why and

2165.42 --> 2168.9
are you attacking me

2167.07 --> 2170.9700000000003
but she was literally trying to break

2168.9 --> 2173.82
open the truth it was when the truth

2170.97 --> 2177.12
true thing had a real serious momentum

2173.82 --> 2178.11
all of a sudden and Alex Jones couldn't

2177.12 --> 2182.3399999999997
handle

2178.11 --> 2183.9300000000003
yeah the moon landings being faked it

2182.34 --> 2187.28
was interesting I've never seen that

2183.93 --> 2191.52
clip back though but I saw it live

2187.28 --> 2194.57
through prison planet TV which I had was

2191.52 --> 2194.57
member of back then

2194.81 --> 2199.41
back then that was the only way to

2196.92 --> 2204.27
really watch the show unless you could

2199.41 --> 2207.2999999999997
watch a second hand streaming when I

2204.27 --> 2209.88
watched it through the site was good it

2207.3 --> 2220.8900000000003
was a good time I was a good time for

2209.88 --> 2223.05
Alex Jones as well anyway yeah that's

2220.89 --> 2225.99
something that happened back then that I

2223.05 --> 2227.01
witnessed and yeah again Internet

2225.99 --> 2231.5
democracy

2227.01 --> 2235.3500000000004
it can solve corruption issues

2231.5 --> 2237.45
thoroughly because she'd literally take

2235.35 --> 2239.0699999999997
away the conversation control

2237.45 --> 2246.23
it's almost taking away the executive

2239.07 --> 2248.46
power and democratizing it directly and

2246.23 --> 2250.47
there needs to be planners for this

2248.46 --> 2256.44
though you need careful planners that

2250.47 --> 2259.56
will be able to present a budget grid on

2256.44 --> 2262.83
which people can vote like what is what

2259.56 --> 2268.08
is prioritized and everyone can put bits

2262.83 --> 2273.33
of contribution into it to prioritize

2268.08 --> 2275.1
things and then you get to see what the

2273.33 --> 2278.13
people really care about and what they

2275.1 --> 2280.17
don't care about and then afterwards

2278.13 --> 2282.96
they can figure out like okay maybe we

2280.17 --> 2285.57
did kind of need that after all and they

2282.96 --> 2287.52
might redo it the next time I think I

2285.57 --> 2291.84
don't know how they did it but it was

2287.52 --> 2293.88
very interesting and can be made

2291.84 --> 2296.4300000000003
possible thanks to the Internet this is

2293.88 --> 2299.1
something that in the 80s was

2296.43 --> 2303.08
technically impossible to do thanks to

2299.1 --> 2303.08
the internet they were able to do this

2303.48 --> 2306.289
it's fascinating

2309.06 --> 2319.77
hmm by the way I'm seriously I think I'm

2316.53 --> 2322.2000000000003
feeling this stuff in my stomach right

2319.77 --> 2327.11
now it's pretty heavy this is not

2322.2 --> 2331.5899999999997
exactly the same type of substances in

2327.11 --> 2334.92
infowar stores as bodies it's more spicy

2331.59 --> 2336.36
I think so and this kind of happened

2334.92 --> 2338.46
yesterday as well I didn't wasn't sure

2336.36 --> 2340.82
but now I'm pretty sure it is that so

2338.46 --> 2346.01
taking that stuff I need to be careful

2340.82 --> 2349.8300000000004
it's not exactly the same but it will

2346.01 --> 2351.51
despite that it's tight despite being a

2349.83 --> 2354.75
little rough on the stomach for a while

2351.51 --> 2357.2000000000003
and it's not really like a nausea it's

2354.75 --> 2357.2
just like

2362.14 --> 2366.6299999999997
could you compare it

2364.8 --> 2368.51
something that just hit your stomach

2366.63 --> 2373.11
really hard like that

2368.51 --> 2376.4100000000003
no very painful nauseating or anything

2373.11 --> 2378.78
but it will be functional as it does

2376.41 --> 2383.3399999999997
have the curcuminoids and all the extra

2378.78 --> 2386.0400000000004
unique substances in your yeah that are

2383.34 --> 2392.81
just part of the organic variety of this

2386.04 --> 2396.86
herb this root powdered root extract

2392.81 --> 2396.86
nope no snacks today

2417.47 --> 2423.0299999999997
huh

2420.0 --> 2429.27
all right it's funny that you mention it

2423.03 --> 2432.78
Aires 106 Leninism it's so that's the

2429.27 --> 2439.08
weird thing Leninism is kind of a form

2432.78 --> 2443.67
of socialism thinking but Marx Marxism

2439.08 --> 2446.19
that just that is the weaponized version

2443.67 --> 2448.08
of it and it is what caused communism

2446.19 --> 2450.71
and just that is what wrecked everything

2448.08 --> 2457.02
weaponized that destroyed the idealist

2450.71 --> 2462.39
turn idealism turn it inside out and but

2457.02 --> 2466.099
yeah Lenin I guess I know I don't

2462.39 --> 2468.6299999999997
particularly hate that guy

2466.099 --> 2471.42
it's kind of nutri to me he's like oh

2468.63 --> 2475.1400000000003
yeah he was kind of smart I think he had

2471.42 --> 2478.77
some issues as well wasn't no he wasn't

2475.14 --> 2481.91
really like a saint although well maybe

2478.77 --> 2484.44
to the Russians to some Russians he is

2481.91 --> 2487.04
can't really understand the context of

2484.44 --> 2487.04
that completely

2488.85 --> 2494.0099999999998
but yes Stalin was just freaked it's a

2493.26 --> 2499.3500000000004
monster

2494.01 --> 2504.5
Lenin was not like that at all as far as

2499.35 --> 2504.5
I understand so

2504.55 --> 2507.48
I don't know

2513.2 --> 2518.45
Bolsheviks yep that's it terrible

2534.38 --> 2541.31
HM that is just insane dude that is

2538.47 --> 2541.31
really insane

2556.12 --> 2558.87
yeah

2567.3 --> 2574.0600000000004
so funny one have been good they were

2570.73 --> 2577.69
all doing the Illuminati hustle well in

2574.06 --> 2580.17
a sense yeah the one the ones

2577.69 --> 2588.76
AJ mentioned they were all wielding

2580.17 --> 2591.34
significant history-changing power so at

2588.76 --> 2597.76
that sense yes they were put into a

2591.34 --> 2600.9700000000003
place where their vision was allowed

2597.76 --> 2603.07
also by the controllers and everything

2600.97 --> 2606.0299999999997
that the situation the setup allowed

2603.07 --> 2609.4
them to like totally change the

2606.03 --> 2613.8900000000003
direction of everything pretty much from

2609.4 --> 2617.77
their own so they all made significant

2613.89 --> 2620.95
influential changes on the world society

2617.77 --> 2628.53
in their own way so at that yeah they

2620.95 --> 2628.5299999999997
were doing the Illuminati hustle indeed

2633.41 --> 2643.95
right what a DM I'm talking in from a

2639.78 --> 2648.86
sub from an individual standpoint they

2643.95 --> 2652.3799999999997
their spirit their vision was just in

2648.86 --> 2656.9300000000003
opportunity to build significant power

2652.38 --> 2656.9300000000003
and influence just as they willed it

2657.05 --> 2664.2200000000003
thanks to everything allowing it pretty

2660.75 --> 2664.22
much the controllers

2672.38 --> 2678.19
and the timing

2675.64 --> 2681.85
because it's always about timing with

2678.19 --> 2685.36
that with that kind of power it builds

2681.85 --> 2689.7599999999998
up vacuum builds up in society things

2685.36 --> 2692.7400000000002
happen people reflect upon it change and

2689.76 --> 2696.5800000000004
grow towards a certain momentum and they

2692.74 --> 2700.6899999999996
will be seeking for examples that fit

2696.58 --> 2703.54
their new spiritual cultural personal

2700.69 --> 2708.13
growth pattern it's what happens they

2703.54 --> 2712.69
seek examples champions icons and those

2708.13 --> 2716.08
icons what they do will almost will

2712.69 --> 2718.4500000000003
often be blindly taken over that's the

2716.08 --> 2727.54
power of stardom when it has the right

2718.45 --> 2734.29
timing and yeah and that you could say

2727.54 --> 2738.04
that yeah that the the political leaders

2734.29 --> 2741.24
this terrible leaders falsity also were

2738.04 --> 2746.62
had some kind of stardom thing to them

2741.24 --> 2750.04
with Hitler it was pretty much yeah

2746.62 --> 2753.22
it worked pretty well it was very

2750.04 --> 2755.32
effective people really did look up to

2753.22 --> 2757.5099999999998
him as some kind of godly hero and with

2755.32 --> 2760.6000000000004
Stalin it was just enforced it was just

2757.51 --> 2766.2700000000004
sheer terror he was the devil literally

2760.6 --> 2770.49
- he was not trying to hide it so it's

2766.27 --> 2770.49
also form of stardom but very dark

2773.22 --> 2780.5099999999998
but that's wielding power in whatever

2776.22 --> 2782.819
frequency with whatever result and all

2780.51 --> 2791.19
the ties and all the sins all influence

2782.819 --> 2795.15
it yeah that's hilarious

2791.19 --> 2799.2000000000003
Aries 106 no I'm pretty sure Freemasonry

2795.15 --> 2801.4700000000003
didn't exist when Jesus was born came

2799.2 --> 2801.47
much later

2806.88 --> 2816.359
but yeah the roots of Freemasonry which

2810.19 --> 2820.93
was well the wide variety of occultists

2816.359 --> 2824.89
occulted knowledge the rest of what

2820.93 --> 2828.489
pretty much opposes the theocracy that

2824.89 --> 2830.89
was around for a long time the

2828.489 --> 2833.319
Freemasonry came out of that as a

2830.89 --> 2838.109
rebellious group basically but they were

2833.319 --> 2841.0589999999997
a cultists so Gnostics and pagans and

2838.109 --> 2845.259
also practitioners of the Dark Arts but

2841.059 --> 2849.489
yet some of them were very likely also

2845.259 --> 2853.69
at the center of the the theocracy to

2849.489 --> 2859.049
themselves they usually are that's where

2853.69 --> 2859.049
they like to be the center of power so

2864.45 --> 2870.45
yeah the Freemasons they pretty much

2866.97 --> 2875.39
came into being think during the late

2870.45 --> 2875.39
medieval times early Renaissance period

2876.38 --> 2882.6
if I'm not mistaken maybe it was just in

2880.47 --> 2889.9199999999996
the middle of medieval time and then it

2882.6 --> 2892.56
could be huh that is odd that now you

2889.92 --> 2896.52
mainly think because look if the

2892.56 --> 2900.39
calendar was indeed switched a thousand

2896.52 --> 2904.23
years then Freemasonry technically

2900.39 --> 2906.75
wouldn't be that far off from when

2904.23 --> 2910.47
Christ would be have been birthed a been

2906.75 --> 2912.99
born maybe a hundred years a couple of

2910.47 --> 2915.93
hundred years at most that's weird

2912.99 --> 2919.0499999999997
doesn't that that made me think but I'm

2915.93 --> 2921.8399999999997
pretty damn sure they as Freemasons were

2919.05 --> 2924.3300000000004
not around during Jesus Christ but there

2921.84 --> 2928.53
were definitely Gnostics and shamans and

2924.33 --> 2933.21
the cultists that also became part of

2928.53 --> 2933.96
the Freemason so what do you think about

2933.21 --> 2935.85
the three kings

2933.96 --> 2940.01
you know you think they were just normal

2935.85 --> 2940.0099999999998
were they literally kings

2941.72 --> 2947.23
and by what they do such a thing why

2944.81 --> 2950.12
would they go on individual trips

2947.23 --> 2953.29
unguided that seems a very wizardly

2950.12 --> 2953.29
thing to do as it were

2964.6 --> 2971.08
believe this stuff Jose I'm just

2966.94 --> 2973.87
speculating that I thought that was kind

2971.08 --> 2977.41
of a parent I'm just putting data

2973.87 --> 2980.2
together historical reference and

2977.41 --> 2981.7599999999998
religious religiously significant data

2980.2 --> 2984.2799999999997
putting it all together and just

2981.76 --> 2989.0800000000004
puzzling with history it's what I like

2984.28 --> 2992.23
to do I do this even outside of my

2989.08 --> 2997.0
hangouts as I said I compare the history

2992.23 --> 3000.54
here and compare it like the pitfalls

2997.0 --> 3005.07
the typical misconceptions and what

3000.54 --> 3008.0099999999998
people what the common people push the

3005.07 --> 3011.1000000000004
historical narrative into the format it

3008.01 --> 3015.3900000000003
automatically becomes and I'm analyzing

3011.1 --> 3018.06
that and then trying to re simulate that

3015.39 --> 3023.45
in my own D in the world somehow to

3018.06 --> 3028.65
really get a real true history kind of

3023.45 --> 3033.12
system where history is a replacement

3028.65 --> 3035.37
story that does kind of make sense that

3033.12 --> 3037.44
makes people feel at ease but there is

3035.37 --> 3039.27
just so much more really going on and

3037.44 --> 3041.28
then when you really start to put the

3039.27 --> 3043.23
pieces together you figure out that the

3041.28 --> 3046.4100000000003
original story was actually complete

3043.23 --> 3048.09
[ __ ] and that's a great adventure on

3046.41 --> 3049.98
its own for the adventurous to figure

3048.09 --> 3052.2000000000003
out and they they have a Bart that is

3049.98 --> 3057.54
definitely historically interested so

3052.2 --> 3060.96
that will be viable piece of the

3057.54 --> 3062.55
adventure for that character and the

3060.96 --> 3065.13
players of course because they will be

3062.55 --> 3067.5600000000004
witnessing it but that Bart character

3065.13 --> 3070.01
will unravel it will allow me to

3067.56 --> 3073.14
basically share the details of the data

3070.01 --> 3078.1200000000003
because I have to hold back a lot this

3073.14 --> 3081.5699999999997
is like giants frameworks of things how

3078.12 --> 3084.69
they work that I have oversight because

3081.57 --> 3086.4900000000002
I created it and I can do that when it

3084.69 --> 3088.56
can only just hand out just a few

3086.49 --> 3090.6299999999997
details about it and I have to really be

3088.56 --> 3092.81
careful not to share it too much every

3090.63 --> 3092.81
time

3100.12 --> 3103.12
god

3103.99 --> 3106.589
and

3108.4 --> 3116.78
I've been thinking maybe the you know I

3111.91 --> 3118.97
kind of like my mustache still but it's

3116.78 --> 3124.63
weird maybe it was a winter thing or

3118.97 --> 3127.31
something because now I don't know I I

3124.63 --> 3132.44
think I might shave it off at some point

3127.31 --> 3135.35
I said I kind of would so maybe I'm

3132.44 --> 3139.25
gonna do that or maybe maybe I will miss

3135.35 --> 3142.1
it if I really miss it I'll grow it back

3139.25 --> 3147.92
but I don't know

3142.1 --> 3151.0099999999998
I think I'll I like at the end of summer

3147.92 --> 3153.08
if I'm gonna shave it up probably at the

3151.01 --> 3155.6800000000003
F at the end of summer I will start to

3153.08 --> 3155.68
regrow it

3157.65 --> 3163.85
but maybe I will be mustache free soon I

3161.07 --> 3163.8500000000004
don't know we'll see

3174.809 --> 3184.679
ha well Jeremy Bennett good question

3178.099 --> 3190.38
the thing is masonry it used to be like

3184.679 --> 3195.7090000000003
a guild originally from which comes

3190.38 --> 3200.069
Pyrus against the theocracy spawned and

3195.709 --> 3204.8689999999997
the actual Freemasons were mostly a part

3200.069 --> 3209.7889999999998
of the designers the architects so they

3204.869 --> 3212.219
weren't literally the the dog we had the

3209.789 --> 3214.5890000000004
workers that actually put the stones

3212.219 --> 3216.539
together and lifted everything and yeah

3214.589 --> 3222.179
did all that but they were did the

3216.539 --> 3224.9390000000003
architects and we still see it today it

3222.179 --> 3228.809
like the the symbol of Freemasonry

3224.939 --> 3233.509
itself is references architecture very

3228.809 --> 3233.509
much so measuring all that

3239.35 --> 3242.1
yeah

3248.14 --> 3257.68
yeah it's very funny because hey in my

3252.32 --> 3257.6800000000003
world there is a masonry guild as well

3259.09 --> 3268.79
but yeah there might be a planned secret

3265.43 --> 3271.7
society they might be part of Vecna as

3268.79 --> 3276.29
it were is the god of secrets in the

3271.7 --> 3279.47
pantheon of the indie yeah which happens

3276.29 --> 3284.359
to be an eye by the ways oh how

3279.47 --> 3286.31
coincidental right so yeah that may be

3284.359 --> 3289.49
part of this world but if that's gonna

3286.31 --> 3291.73
come forth it will be later when the

3289.49 --> 3295.8799999999997
Renaissance really breaks loose and

3291.73 --> 3299.119
people switch from swords and crossbows

3295.88 --> 3303.2200000000003
and bows to guns and cannons and all

3299.119 --> 3305.69
that there's a big chance that they will

3303.22 --> 3307.6699999999996
start to get involved they will be part

3305.69 --> 3314.96
of the designers of this technology a

3307.67 --> 3317.359
lot in this world so yeah I didn't I

3314.96 --> 3320.02
have plans for freaking everything

3317.359 --> 3323.21
everything started out like oh yeah uh

3320.02 --> 3326.15
okay this is a mercenary guild

3323.21 --> 3328.76
it's like oh yeah a building this is a

3326.15 --> 3330.4900000000002
mercenary Gil and leave it for like half

3328.76 --> 3335.03
a year and then I come back I think like

3330.49 --> 3337.04
how is how do they actually work how do

3335.03 --> 3338.8390000000004
they function how do they survive I

3337.04 --> 3339.98
where their loyalties how are they

3338.839 --> 3342.2
towards each other

3339.98 --> 3345.68
what are their morals and then suddenly

3342.2 --> 3350.81
it becomes like a a culture on it out on

3345.68 --> 3354.3999999999996
its own that's really what I do with my

3350.81 --> 3358.099
D in the world it's pretty fascinating

3354.4 --> 3360.88
what things just develop into naturally

3358.099 --> 3360.88
for me

3362.42 --> 3365.42
yeah

3377.27 --> 3387.65
playing gods well I'm playing a designer

3380.2 --> 3394.1299999999997
so hey a creator yes but I honored the

3387.65 --> 3398.02
Creator I do my best i I take morality

3394.13 --> 3401.63
within the game very seriously I do not

3398.02 --> 3404.33
try to pretend like oh oh wait no this

3401.63 --> 3409.07
is not evil even though it is obviously

3404.33 --> 3411.619
evil because of how the game works

3409.07 --> 3413.7200000000003
I will definitely present like how

3411.619 --> 3416.03
things will be corrupted in certain

3413.72 --> 3418.2799999999997
times that the atmosphere is just so bad

3416.03 --> 3421.3100000000004
that everybody starts to do dark [ __ ]

3418.28 --> 3423.6800000000003
but I will I don't I will not push

3421.31 --> 3427.94
towards that if I can not for long at

3423.68 --> 3431.33
least because terrible setting but I

3427.94 --> 3433.91
will never break with logos in my game

3431.33 --> 3439.34
and I honor the Creator with my creation

3433.91 --> 3442.49
and if he indeed makes made man in His

3439.34 --> 3447.29
image then I am trying to do my best to

3442.49 --> 3452.4199999999996
reflect that image by being a creator

3447.29 --> 3456.97
creating a world in my mind as God

3452.42 --> 3456.9700000000003
created his world in his mind

3458.52 --> 3462.44
because that is how I see it kind of

3468.77 --> 3483.03
yeah so yeah a little teeny little

3477.21 --> 3485.73
history a little creativity structural

3483.03 --> 3488.4900000000002
thinking societal complex structures I

3485.73 --> 3490.5
love it so I will probably be talking a

3488.49 --> 3492.45
lot more too about this and trying to

3490.5 --> 3496.589
analyze even real-world things that I

3492.45 --> 3498.839
that catch my attention at times or if

3496.589 --> 3500.849
people ask ask about it because you know

3498.839 --> 3503.19
what questions do to me they break me

3500.849 --> 3505.349
open and I give very extensive detailed

3503.19 --> 3507.96
answers that normally I would not come

3505.349 --> 3510.48
conceive by myself it's only the

3507.96 --> 3515.94
questions that break these answers open

3510.48 --> 3520.859
to be clear so I am gonna run out the

3515.94 --> 3524.27
show because the debates are about to
