are we wrong windows open so yeah how

24.81 --> 31.979999999999997
you guys all doing I hope you didn't

27.06 --> 34.559
miss me too much yesterday because yeah

31.98 --> 39.69
I had the appointment right when the

34.559 --> 47.959999999999994
show starts I say new gamer group was

39.69 --> 53.28
pretty damn cool yeah new people really

47.96 --> 55.44
really freaking smart geeky people and I

53.28 --> 58.25
just had to basically sit back and just

55.44 --> 61.26
like oh [ __ ]

58.25 --> 65.129
these are pretty intense people with

61.26 --> 68.75999999999999
well thought-out train of thoughts that

65.129 --> 75.17
work wise in the other direction in many

68.76 --> 75.17
ways and that's basically size up there

78.14 --> 85.37
how they maintain their own humanity as

81.53 --> 89.15
it were it's complicated intelligent

85.37 --> 92.69
people it is just very complicated but

89.15 --> 96.29
yeah was pretty cool and I got a got to

92.69 --> 99.67
make a really awesome character that I'm

96.29 --> 99.67
probably gonna enjoy a lot

101.409 --> 104.10000000000001
yeah

107.65 --> 120.85000000000001
it makes me

110.32 --> 123.60999999999999
I wish the weather would just be a

120.85 --> 126.91
little bit better as well though still

123.61 --> 129.119
stay so rainy and cloudy and I'm sick of

126.91 --> 129.119
that

138.61 --> 142.91000000000003
anyway

141.18 --> 146.99
let's see

142.91 --> 153.92
so Chad Alicia can see Daniel fields

146.99 --> 158.87
your concern a yarn Dino right Johnny

153.92 --> 164.81
there are no Voynich browsing Tintin

158.87 --> 170.33
Monaco are under light water over my

164.81 --> 171.92000000000002
Gulati Andrea browning if we build right

170.33 --> 175.57000000000002
um see ya

171.92 --> 175.57
hello guys girls

177.28 --> 183.85
so yeah I haven't really paid a lot of

181.36 --> 186.91000000000003
attention yesterday to what was going on

183.85 --> 190.57
in media and such which is not strange

186.91 --> 195.51999999999998
because I was basically with that group

190.57 --> 197.79999999999998
gamers all day so but I did happen to

195.52 --> 199.75
catch a few things here and there and

197.8 --> 202.08
now I have to like remember all that

199.75 --> 202.08
again

211.23 --> 213.98
oh yeah

215.95 --> 221.04999999999998
no Saturday

219.55 --> 223.03
wait

221.05 --> 225.70000000000002
today

223.03 --> 229.81
and Sunday right so Friday I have bumped

225.7 --> 233.95
into somebody in the supermarket really

229.81 --> 239.38
nice lady and she told me she recognized

233.95 --> 243.01
me from this the show the show about

239.38 --> 243.73
flattered yeah that her husband was

243.01 --> 246.19
watching

243.73 --> 251.41
apparently boyfriends so that was really

246.19 --> 255.209
funny I don't know exactly who it was

251.41 --> 258.94
somebody called Mike oh I think or I

255.209 --> 261.94
don't know and I probably don't know

258.94 --> 265.09
Moll that well but yeah if you recognize

261.94 --> 267.51
your wife from having told you that he

265.09 --> 281.919
saw me in the supermarket then say hello

267.51 --> 287.03999999999996
hi right oh thank you John Giardino for

281.919 --> 287.03999999999996
the super chat New Zealand Dollars

288.81 --> 294.72
yeah and lot he says that's really funny

291.93 --> 298.68
but I thought it was actually kind of

294.72 --> 302.25
unnerving it's like like the feeling

298.68 --> 304.32
like oh god no it's not gonna be like as

302.25 --> 306.72
long as it's not gonna go as terrible as

304.32 --> 309.51
superstar state is that I can go

306.72 --> 314.49
anywhere without everybody staring at me

309.51 --> 316.919
or a bunch of crazy fan mobs running up

314.49 --> 320.13
to me I don't like the idea of that at

316.919 --> 325.77
all to be fair that's not what I did

320.13 --> 332.03
this for really but yeah you ballers are

325.77 --> 332.03
hilarious yeah I'll I'll sign your globe

333.08 --> 336.87
I'll sign your globe just bring your

335.43 --> 341.7
globe here and I'll sign it

336.87 --> 344.18
it's flat or win no problem I'll do that

341.7 --> 344.18
for you guys

345.73 --> 348.27000000000004
yeah

354.24 --> 364.59000000000003
right I'm still far from that status and

358.35 --> 369.03000000000003
I don't even know if I'm material for

364.59 --> 372.03
that kind of thing you know and probably

369.03 --> 374.52
once that starts to happen then the dark

372.03 --> 377.15999999999997
ones will start to get involved again

374.52 --> 378.81
they're like oh yeah you have to do this

377.16 --> 383.09000000000003
financial thing and then you get the

378.81 --> 386.099
entire world stage oh thanks

383.09 --> 388.88
maybe I'll just do things like I do

386.099 --> 388.88
things and

392.41 --> 396.51000000000005
because I'm just a guy anyway

399.189 --> 405.399
I sometimes just don't get it that

401.08 --> 408.06899999999996
people even do that just because they

405.399 --> 411.729
recognize somebody from something they

408.069 --> 414.33000000000004
watch that they think that that is so

411.729 --> 414.33
special

425.439 --> 434.379
you know it's like if I would recognize

429.759 --> 438.969
somebody from TV when I saw them in real

434.379 --> 442.899
life I'd be like hey I think I know that

438.969 --> 446.039
guy or that girl hello cool that's it

442.899 --> 449.559
it's like hey yeah I recognize it

446.039 --> 453.219
doesn't mean anything other than yeah

449.559 --> 455.8
you're probably deep in that whole thing

453.219 --> 458.8
used to a lot of people responding in

455.8 --> 462.309
reflection to your profession blah blah

458.8 --> 464.499
blah and having a certain attitude and

462.309 --> 466.509
everybody buying that that's probably

464.499 --> 471.92900000000003
what's going to be happening to these

466.509 --> 477.98900000000003
famous TV people they get railroaded

471.929 --> 477.989
socially image wise by their jobs

494.45 --> 498.849
and

496.249 --> 498.84900000000005
yeah

503.06 --> 505.87
it's pretty cool

514.57 --> 520.12
yeah even though it's a glue Marwin

517.389 --> 524.229
getting spotted will keep you Daffy Oh

520.12 --> 526.42
really because Fe only exists as long as

524.229 --> 530.86
we are in attention and after that then

526.42 --> 534.61
we are die we die and we are erased from

530.86 --> 537.25
this world in your lovely lovely fantasy

534.61 --> 543.22
of eternal globe belief everywhere

537.25 --> 547.35
forever right no look can like whatever

543.22 --> 549.8190000000001
you want you can push whatever you like

547.35 --> 558.4300000000001
it's probably gonna turn out to be a

549.819 --> 561.399
flat globe okay so yeah what you going

558.43 --> 564.579
to do then they don't know it's not a

561.399 --> 567.93
globe it's flat no it's not flat it's a

564.579 --> 570.55
globe yeah it's both yeah that's what

567.93 --> 574.8599999999999
you're psychologically battling each

570.55 --> 577.779
other and you can't help it because yeah

574.86 --> 580.69
you're both right and you're both wrong

577.779 --> 584.019
good luck with that you know I I would

580.69 --> 585.5500000000001
find that very satisfying the ironic if

584.019 --> 587.67
that turned out to be the case at this

585.55 --> 587.67
point

594.71 --> 605.7900000000001
another flow a flat globe literally flat

600.899 --> 608.779
physically geometrically flat surface

605.79 --> 611.779
interconnected like a globe perfectly

608.779 --> 611.779
perhaps

612.71 --> 617.48
yeah and it is all flat it will all all

616.7 --> 621.649
of it

617.48 --> 628.76
all of it be flat but it's still gonna

621.649 --> 633.05
be a globe yeah lovely isn't it lovely

628.76 --> 635.6899999999999
how you don't want it to be that surreal

633.05 --> 639.9799999999999
and that tricking just like the globe of

635.69 --> 642.2900000000001
the heavens realisation is kind of

639.98 --> 646.48
uncomfortable but that's the whole point

642.29 --> 650.75
it's about digging deeper and breaking

646.48 --> 652.339
your own pre-conceptual eyes mind that's

650.75 --> 655.399
what it's been about that's what it's

652.339 --> 658.7600000000001
all about all of it everything this

655.399 --> 660.95
movement does always about the

658.76 --> 663.709
psychology the psychology really is the

660.95 --> 668.32
only factor that's really at play the

663.709 --> 669.8499999999999
rest is just data gathering

668.32 --> 671.95
working through that it's fully

669.85 --> 674.23
automated it'll happen

671.95 --> 678.34
no matter what you do but it's always

674.23 --> 680.82
been about the psychology so yeah flat

678.34 --> 680.82
globe

689.92 --> 700.899
but hey it's just a a hunch a hunch

702.41 --> 708.86
now it would be a sign of perfect

704.72 --> 710.75
duality in a way and yeah a lot of

708.86 --> 713.9
things in turn to out turn out to be

710.75 --> 718.12
that so but yeah knows you know it's

713.9 --> 721.88
still up for discovery at this point

718.12 --> 725.05
still need to actually confirm or

721.88 --> 725.05
disconfirm that

726.81 --> 733.68
so yeah how the landmasses are laid out

730.13 --> 737.12
interconnected that's still yeah we

733.68 --> 737.12
still need to figure that one out

748.51 --> 754.9
yeah look merchandise merchandise yeah

752.0 --> 760.07
how do you gonna merchandise that one

754.9 --> 763.61
how do you merchandise a spacial

760.07 --> 765.7600000000001
nonlinear thing good luck with that you

763.61 --> 771.85
know the only thing you could probably

765.76 --> 773.08
merchandise it at as is a virtual 3d

771.85 --> 775.73
[Music]

773.08 --> 778.5400000000001
computer-animated model or something

775.73 --> 781.4
that's probably the only way kind of

778.54 --> 785.7099999999999
stone merchandise it's not physically

781.4 --> 788.12
linear it's that you can do that yeah

785.71 --> 792.1700000000001
that's the whole problem we always

788.12 --> 798.4
wanted literally literal oh so simple so

792.17 --> 802.5699999999999
directs yeah it's not the world is not

798.4 --> 807.1899999999999
sorry you're gonna get a half gonna get

802.57 --> 807.19
neat to get over that it's just

812.58 --> 820.9200000000001
so nice things are so easy to

815.79 --> 822.1999999999999
conceptualize and build a small version

820.92 --> 828.9499999999999
of it

822.2 --> 828.95
look at that you can't did yes can't

829.279 --> 835.16
because it's not spatially Lynn linear

854.09 --> 865.25
now that was not pizza it was the usual

857.8 --> 868.66
strawberry jelly sandwich I don't eat

865.25 --> 868.66
pizza in the freaking morning

894.22 --> 899.01
while you're trolls are really getting

895.99 --> 899.01
at it right yeah

900.389 --> 903.799
mr. rest of you

909.18 --> 913.92
that you'll go on a break or something

933.49 --> 937.17
a lottery stop whining

939.31 --> 944.439
you're not gonna make any merchandise

941.56 --> 947.16
for me and you're not funny and it's not

944.439 --> 947.16
original

962.04 --> 967.64
right then Winfield

968.13 --> 977.459
yeah I will absolutely try if I can and

973.11 --> 981.9590000000001
I probably will be able to join the

977.459 --> 985.2589999999999
Amsterdam Flattr of conference like I

981.959 --> 988.2589999999999
have to go there this point it would be

985.259 --> 991.1990000000001
absolutely idiotic for me not to go to a

988.259 --> 993.69
conference like that since I've been

991.199 --> 996.139
wanting to do something like that for

993.69 --> 996.139
years

998.23 --> 1008.4
and I have a daily show it's like an ax

1000.6 --> 1011.76
model and concepts a lot of them so yeah

1008.4 --> 1016.0799999999999
I have no problem going there and yeah

1011.76 --> 1018.78
sure I'll stand on the stage and talk

1016.08 --> 1022.26
about psychology aspects of Flat Earth

1018.78 --> 1024.089
and trolls and any of that it's all a

1022.26 --> 1028.8
matter of what questions are lying up

1024.089 --> 1032.1499999999999
and if I don't have to sneeze every

1028.8 --> 1032.1499999999999
freaking half a minute

1038.43 --> 1041.5700000000002
and that was annoying

1047.04 --> 1059.26
we yeah and look looping the whole

1052.63 --> 1063.3400000000001
special nonlinear concept I still seem

1059.26 --> 1068.64
to be the only one in the whole damn

1063.34 --> 1068.6399999999999
world at this point talking about this

1068.7 --> 1075.8400000000001
am I the only one here that actually

1072.19 --> 1081.73
gets it I've explained it so many times

1075.84 --> 1083.83
it is so obvious that it is probably

1081.73 --> 1088.06
gonna turn out to be a part of the

1083.83 --> 1090.1
world's design am I really the only one

1088.06 --> 1094.08
that gets it because that would be

1090.1 --> 1094.08
highly highly disappointed

1097.95 --> 1103.8300000000002
that would be disappointing in the rest

1101.4 --> 1110.0
of humanity pretty much like come on

1103.83 --> 1110.0
people it's not that difficult

1112.92 --> 1118.23
but I hate if I'm gonna be the only one

1115.59 --> 1120.09
talking about it no sure I'll uh be

1118.23 --> 1122.58
talking about it everybody will be

1120.09 --> 1125.6399999999999
staring in amazement like aw it's magic

1122.58 --> 1129.86
I'm special and I don't get it because I

1125.64 --> 1129.8600000000001
can't repeat it great

1138.669 --> 1141.419
hyperspace

1158.87 --> 1173.9899999999998
right Andrea browning how can you say

1164.34 --> 1176.97
that how would you know of course

1173.99 --> 1180.39
conceptually that seems logical since

1176.97 --> 1187.32
everything always goes on and there's

1180.39 --> 1190.26
always more and it's more likely that a

1187.32 --> 1192.8999999999999
mind will simply disintegrate and

1190.26 --> 1197.91
implode on itself then actually reach

1192.9 --> 1198.45
the all of knowledge since we are part

1197.91 --> 1202.1100000000001
of it

1198.45 --> 1209.22
and yeah the parts cannot contain the

1202.11 --> 1211.26
whole that makes sense but yeah what is

1209.22 --> 1213.65
beyond that okay what is beyond the

1211.26 --> 1213.65
looping

1226.71 --> 1233.1490000000001
gonna talk about like you to

1229.399 --> 1233.149
interdimensional relations

1235.809 --> 1240.969
like how do the over dimensions are the

1238.96 --> 1243.969
sub dimensions if there even is such a

1240.969 --> 1248.279
thing how do they all physically connect

1243.969 --> 1251.229
oh yeah it's gonna get really freaky

1248.279 --> 1255.479
when you go there it's pretty much

1251.229 --> 1255.479
science fiction territory by default

1265.27 --> 1270.87
but yeah I think that spatial

1267.87 --> 1270.87
non-linearity

1271.75 --> 1281.76
like all falls into the category of

1275.909 --> 1287.169
spatial connectivity relations

1281.76 --> 1289.059
it's just how is space and ya build the

1287.169 --> 1291.97
depth of the dimensions how is it

1289.059 --> 1296.289
interconnected how does that work how

1291.97 --> 1301.03
does it manifest how does it naturally

1296.289 --> 1303.929
fall into its place and stay stable that

1301.03 --> 1307.72
kind of thing yeah it's probably like

1303.929 --> 1310.63
have some heavy secret physics

1307.72 --> 1313.39
departments working on that and making

1310.63 --> 1317.1100000000001
Mobile's out of it and already designing

1313.39 --> 1319.0900000000001
[ __ ] to do that completely outside of

1317.11 --> 1323.1999999999998
our knowledge and I'm gonna pop out with

1319.09 --> 1325.57
it like oh yeah yep we're

1323.2 --> 1329.1100000000001
science-fiction gods have no say in this

1325.57 --> 1330.6689999999999
you're all stupid stupid cattle then

1329.11 --> 1332.9399999999998
we're gonna do with this whatever we

1330.669 --> 1332.94
want

1332.97 --> 1343.549
something like that

1335.94 --> 1343.549
hell knows you know if they master the

1343.969 --> 1351.1190000000001
spatial aspects or the yeah the

1348.659 --> 1352.769
nonlinear aspect of space then was to

1351.119 --> 1357.119
say they couldn't do the same thing with

1352.769 --> 1360.479
time and then yeah you get over killed

1357.119 --> 1365.389
cheat mode basically because yeah what

1360.479 --> 1370.529
if you could enter a space somewhere

1365.389 --> 1372.779
virtually and have infinite amounts of

1370.529 --> 1375.629
time like what if you could make

1372.779 --> 1378.719
something create something that would

1375.629 --> 1383.4889999999998
allow you to in a week's time do

1378.719 --> 1387.269
research of 200 years with anything you

1383.489 --> 1391.549
need within the sub realm it would be

1387.269 --> 1391.549
very much like a computer simulation

1395.46 --> 1401.64
but the simulation would be perfect

1398.91 --> 1405.39
emulation of actual reality itself it's

1401.64 --> 1408.24
a reality like system right we're going

1405.39 --> 1415.5300000000002
into really heavy science fiction stuff

1408.24 --> 1419.79
right now but sure they got it probably

1415.53 --> 1425.55
using it or they probably have used it

1419.79 --> 1428.25
and pretty much got every result out of

1425.55 --> 1431.52
it they could and they're just sitting

1428.25 --> 1433.53
staring at these results and like okay

1431.52 --> 1438.9
are we gonna use this or are we gonna

1433.53 --> 1442.8799999999999
hide this and when is a good enough

1438.9 --> 1442.88
reason to start using this stuff

1448.15 --> 1450.9
it's like

1451.48 --> 1455.73
they have like a Museum of

1455.789 --> 1464.3799999999999
transdimensional wonders like like God

1460.659 --> 1466.6000000000001
has the construct of the heavens in the

1464.38 --> 1471.19
over dimension on a pedestal and they

1466.6 --> 1473.4399999999998
have all these technological insane

1471.19 --> 1477.519
marbles that are just way too far away

1473.44 --> 1480.519
too much out there just in their little

1477.519 --> 1485.309
Museum like oh yeah we did this and

1480.519 --> 1489.159
that's and that and that and that and

1485.309 --> 1492.1299999999999
yeah I just kind of wait some more

1489.159 --> 1494.8200000000002
because this is all just too too

1492.13 --> 1497.6200000000001
disruptive to interfering as soon as we

1494.82 --> 1499.57
unleash one of these things everything

1497.62 --> 1502.059
is going to change and it's totally

1499.57 --> 1503.47
unpredictable or we even predicted how

1502.059 --> 1506.7
it would change and it would end up

1503.47 --> 1511.539
destroying everything that kind of [ __ ]

1506.7 --> 1514.539
like yeah which one of the it's like a

1511.539 --> 1516.76
game show choose your Pandora's box are

1514.539 --> 1521.309
you gonna look into box number one north

1516.76 --> 1521.309
number five number 20

1523.93 --> 1528.39
yay you get it

1528.94 --> 1531.66
yeah

1548.86 --> 1557.6789999999999
anyway a little reference about the

1553.87 --> 1563.049
gaming group I got into like these

1557.679 --> 1567.0900000000001
people are scientific researchers like a

1563.049 --> 1570.1589999999999
really serious [ __ ] one was actually

1567.09 --> 1572.4089999999999
specialized in genetic modification of

1570.159 --> 1575.3500000000001
that made me swallow for a moment like

1572.409 --> 1578.2
oh okay

1575.35 --> 1581.4089999999999
that on one hand scares the [ __ ] out of

1578.2 --> 1586.919
me on the other hand is a absolutely

1581.409 --> 1589.3890000000001
unique opportunity to from close by

1586.919 --> 1592.269
basically get to know some really

1589.389 --> 1594.6689999999999
intricate stuff about that not hope to

1592.269 --> 1597.669
do it but like what are the real

1594.669 --> 1603.5800000000002
dilemmas the real things they've come

1597.669 --> 1606.8200000000002
across the refined extracted knowledge

1603.58 --> 1608.26
that only a true expert that dedicates

1606.82 --> 1612.9399999999998
their life up to something

1608.26 --> 1615.01
can can gather so yeah I will learn more

1612.94 --> 1621.73
about that know what they're doing and

1615.01 --> 1623.51
still all very new to me but it was good

1621.73 --> 1628.779
and

1623.51 --> 1628.779
they're really smart people they also I

1629.649 --> 1634.039
they may have heard about Flat Earth

1632.12 --> 1636.4089999999999
when you're that freaking smart it's

1634.039 --> 1641.12
almost inevitable that at some point you

1636.409 --> 1644.1100000000001
bump into it and probably be smart

1641.12 --> 1650.059
enough to give it a secondary tertiary

1644.11 --> 1652.1589999999999
place in priorities but they yeah it's

1650.059 --> 1654.5
like in the adventure like one of the

1652.159 --> 1659.98
first mysteries that we were supposedly

1654.5 --> 1663.74
going to solve was about yeah a mystery

1659.98 --> 1669.559
thing like there was a dragon sort of

1663.74 --> 1671.09
dragon skeleton in a old mine and there

1669.559 --> 1673.37
were some other things involved and we

1671.09 --> 1675.559
had to figure out like archaeologists

1673.37 --> 1681.4089999999999
basically like what is this how did

1675.559 --> 1684.08
where did this come from what happened

1681.409 --> 1689.0590000000002
to it and it was fascinating and in the

1684.08 --> 1690.1589999999999
middle I made like a an inquiry like hey

1689.059 --> 1693.23
this

1690.159 --> 1696.71
dragonoid apparently didn't have wings

1693.23 --> 1700.1
and it's unusual in D&D cosmology so I

1696.71 --> 1701.0
was like okay I'm gonna check like the

1700.1 --> 1704.6589999999999
vertebrates

1701.0 --> 1708.47
one by one and see if any of them

1704.659 --> 1710.5390000000002
mismatched it's like maybe somebody

1708.47 --> 1714.83
tampered with it to make it look

1710.539 --> 1717.74
different you know maybe the Smithsonian

1714.83 --> 1720.049
was here I told them that and they

1717.74 --> 1724.549
laughed out loud they got it it's like

1720.049 --> 1726.99
oh [ __ ] so they're not not entirely

1724.549 --> 1731.04
oblivious to what's going on out there

1726.99 --> 1733.89
they know about the Smithsonian screwing

1731.04 --> 1739.17
with archeological data they got that

1733.89 --> 1743.2800000000002
and that was like yeah testing people

1739.17 --> 1746.01
with jokes do they get it do they

1743.28 --> 1749.28
realize what's going on out there up to

1746.01 --> 1752.46
what level it's for me it's fascinating

1749.28 --> 1757.29
new ground to explore mental new ground

1752.46 --> 1762.02
to explore in a pretty region where yeah

1757.29 --> 1766.71
the thoughts are detailed and heavy and

1762.02 --> 1770.37
rife with comedy as side effect because

1766.71 --> 1774.83
yeah that's what happens people get

1770.37 --> 1774.83
really smart they'll turn to comedy

1775.67 --> 1781.8300000000002
fooling around a lot their friends and

1778.32 --> 1784.08
hey I do it as much as I can although I

1781.83 --> 1788.12
have this weird tendency to be so

1784.08 --> 1788.12
serious that

1788.84 --> 1793.6999999999998
yeah that the comedy is sometimes lost

1791.21 --> 1796.58
or I choose it to be lost basically

1793.7 --> 1804.3400000000001
almost it's weird but I'm slightly

1796.58 --> 1807.86
different than that's it yes I said rife

1804.34 --> 1812.899
don't know if that was the correct use

1807.86 --> 1813.639
of words maybe right would be the better

1812.899 --> 1817.129
one

1813.639 --> 1818.9289999999999
let's see sometimes I use words and I

1817.129 --> 1821.899
don't actually even know what they mean

1818.929 --> 1824.289
I just do it intuitively let's see what

1821.899 --> 1824.289
it means

1828.299 --> 1834.229
hmm okay could fit sorry but

1834.73 --> 1842.559
yeah ripe would be better as in growing

1839.799 --> 1845.58
from a natural state into a maximum

1842.559 --> 1845.58
potential of it

1846.53 --> 1853.28
they they ripen with comedy the comedy

1848.78 --> 1855.47
becomes the fruits of the intellect and

1853.28 --> 1858.77
I guess it is kind of right that that

1855.47 --> 1861.98
happens with intelligent people in

1858.77 --> 1864.61
general there's no intelligence there's

1861.98 --> 1864.6100000000001
no comedy

1868.74 --> 1873.179
yeah I know it's okay if I use the wrong

1871.32 --> 1875.73
words whether it's not really it's

1873.179 --> 1878.3400000000001
really annoying but the funny thing is I

1875.73 --> 1883.01
kind of did use it in a correct way just

1878.34 --> 1883.01
not the correct way that I intended to

1883.19 --> 1887.39
it's a comedy of reality

1899.049 --> 1905.809
annoying shitty trolls out here I've

1903.59 --> 1910.809
been getting really really freaking

1905.809 --> 1916.1499999999999
annoyed by you trolls whining whining on

1910.809 --> 1921.2
about Nathan and respect me you know

1916.15 --> 1925.429
like why don't you drop it it is so

1921.2 --> 1930.169
annoying okay I know who Nathan is I

1925.429 --> 1935.51
know the essential differences and I

1930.169 --> 1939.0800000000002
know that we are not blood brother type

1935.51 --> 1944.6
friendship okay I'm not oblivious he is

1939.08 --> 1951.1399999999999
him I am me we are allies in this

1944.6 --> 1955.49
we are business relations in this

1951.14 --> 1957.7990000000002
because yeah it is also that and there

1955.49 --> 1960.2
is no problem here he just has a

1957.799 --> 1965.35
different approach he likes to make

1960.2 --> 1972.1100000000001
jokes about me and I like to sometimes

1965.35 --> 1974.2099999999998
like break his spell and just lift up

1972.11 --> 1977.57
the veil for a moment to expose what's

1974.21 --> 1979.82
really also driving him just to break

1977.57 --> 1982.52
that image of it and he knows that and

1979.82 --> 1985.01
he's frustrated by that and he accepts

1982.52 --> 1988.07
it still so there's sort of a sparring

1985.01 --> 1990.98
interaction between us but this constant

1988.07 --> 1993.95
whining that he's nerd my friend and you

1990.98 --> 1998.71
have to beat oh no he's gonna come for

1993.95 --> 1998.71
me stop it it's so stupid

2003.019 --> 2008.519
yeah and I know Nathan doesn't like to

2005.789 --> 2009.69
be interrupted that doesn't mean that it

2008.519 --> 2013.019
shouldn't be done

2009.69 --> 2015.3890000000001
I will damn well interrupt him and I

2013.019 --> 2022.83
will annoy the [ __ ] out of him every

2015.389 --> 2027.6789999999999
single time I do it I'm gonna do what

2022.83 --> 2027.6789999999999
I'm gonna do and he will do what he does

2033.14 --> 2037.01
and sometimes if you don't interrupt

2035.059 --> 2039.74
people in what they're doing then

2037.01 --> 2042.89
they're gonna fall into a railroad

2039.74 --> 2045.29
spiral off themselves and there's not

2042.89 --> 2047.45
going to be a lot of new things coming

2045.29 --> 2053.99
out of that so I think that I have a

2047.45 --> 2056.59
function in that the tested to test is

2053.99 --> 2056.5899999999997
patience

2060.35 --> 2063.85
just what is gonna be

2107.54 --> 2110.54
anyway

2112.13 --> 2115.2490000000003
[Music]

2141.0 --> 2144.45
yeah I don't know if there's gonna be a

2142.74 --> 2148.2
Flat Earth debate there wasn't one

2144.45 --> 2151.6499999999996
yesterday that's for sure so yeah there

2148.2 --> 2153.5989999999997
was neither of nerely bird nor a debate

2151.65 --> 2155.9100000000003
I don't know if he's gonna do one today

2153.599 --> 2157.65
I don't see any links yet but that

2155.91 --> 2161.96
doesn't mean that there aren't gonna be

2157.65 --> 2164.34
any he will do premiere restreams

2161.96 --> 2168.51
obviously as he always does it's fully

2164.34 --> 2171.57
automated for him I don't know don't you

2168.51 --> 2175.73
ask him why do you assume that I know

2171.57 --> 2175.73
everything about what everyone does

2181.14 --> 2188.0
they know how they do it why they do it

2184.17 --> 2188.0
and don't know everything they use

2200.06 --> 2204.68
and me

2202.13 --> 2210.9990000000003
do you watch any of the revolutions

2204.68 --> 2216.44
going on like what like everything

2210.999 --> 2223.9399999999996
everywhere going nuts yeah I do watch

2216.44 --> 2227.38
that sometimes and again I said it

2223.94 --> 2234.44
before you know everything is going

2227.38 --> 2241.4790000000003
getting amped up and it's creepy it's

2234.44 --> 2244.759
tragic it's necessary and it's unnerving

2241.479 --> 2252.229
but that's what's happening and it's

2244.759 --> 2254.239
happening in everything and corporations

2252.229 --> 2258.799
are doing some weird [ __ ]

2254.239 --> 2262.2490000000003
some dangerous maneuvering and the funny

2258.799 --> 2266.869
thing was and again synchronicity of a

2262.249 --> 2270.589
whole nother type while I was at these

2266.869 --> 2274.509
new this new gamer group they talked

2270.589 --> 2277.5389999999998
about what their management was doing

2274.509 --> 2280.549
and it's the same [ __ ]

2277.539 --> 2283.0690000000004
it was very fastly I've never even heard

2280.549 --> 2286.94
of their companies before how they make

2283.069 --> 2290.119
business decisions but they seem to be

2286.94 --> 2295.089
having also similar things like the

2290.119 --> 2295.089
hideous amped up tension is higher

2298.92 --> 2305.55
people are getting fired and that kind

2301.62 --> 2308.81
of thing for financial reasons not for

2305.55 --> 2312.8300000000004
incompetence reasons I read anything in

2308.81 --> 2312.83
some tough stuff going on

2328.01 --> 2330.6090000000004
huh

2336.27 --> 2345.21
but yeah how much can you really say

2339.42 --> 2347.81
about it like okay apparently there's

2345.21 --> 2347.81
like a

2349.37 --> 2354.5099999999998
collaboration between a couple of

2352.41 --> 2359.64
governments I think mostly the Asian

2354.51 --> 2364.25
governments and Google and some others

2359.64 --> 2368.37
primarily Google and branchings that to

2364.25 --> 2371.52
introduce a a true survey surveillance

2368.37 --> 2373.8199999999997
grid very much like the one they've been

2371.52 --> 2378.18
testing in China and everybody's gonna

2373.82 --> 2380.6000000000004
go away it was Saudi Arabia Russia and

2378.18 --> 2380.6
China

2384.109 --> 2390.979
but to be fair it's to me it feels

2388.369 --> 2393.38
especially because of the variation of

2390.979 --> 2397.1899999999996
these groups culture over I think it's

2393.38 --> 2401.2290000000003
an experiment to them they're testing

2397.19 --> 2408.2490000000003
out how the surveillance surveillance

2401.229 --> 2412.609
grid will actually work um set cultures

2408.249 --> 2416.1499999999996
what will it do will it be efficient or

2412.609 --> 2418.5789999999997
will it just be demoralizing what will

2416.15 --> 2421.489
it do I think they're like doing like

2418.579 --> 2423.739
open experiments right now in that sense

2421.489 --> 2428.39
and they already tried it a bit China

2423.739 --> 2431.559
and now they're moving on and I'm kind

2428.39 --> 2436.1299999999997
of wondering even like Russia really

2431.559 --> 2438.289
what are they doing that on I don't I

2436.13 --> 2442.309
have no idea what Russia typically

2438.289 --> 2447.349
censors I know they're very they don't

2442.309 --> 2451.19
like anti-government stuff in general or

2447.349 --> 2455.569
maybe they will censor like LGBT D

2451.19 --> 2457.64
whatever P you extreme liberal [ __ ] I

2455.569 --> 2459.199
don't know I didn't have no idea what

2457.64 --> 2461.989
they're gonna even be censoring they're

2459.199 --> 2464.2090000000003
like with Saudi Arabia's very easy it's

2461.989 --> 2467.089
like yeah screw all women they're gonna

2464.209 --> 2469.5789999999997
be [ __ ] they're gonna be even more

2467.089 --> 2472.4
brutalized that's really obvious mostly

2469.579 --> 2476.69
and in China yes it's going to be

2472.4 --> 2480.65
China's just total autocratic control

2476.69 --> 2482.39
freak government's politicize program

2480.65 --> 2485.9590000000003
that everybody is going to be forced to

2482.39 --> 2488.769
follow or die but in Russia I have no

2485.959 --> 2492.0789999999997
idea how that's gonna apply really

2488.769 --> 2493.999
maybe they chose a really modest version

2492.079 --> 2498.289
I don't know I think I'm not hearing

2493.999 --> 2500.799
anything about it I will try to find

2498.289 --> 2500.7990000000004
something

2506.08 --> 2511.59
but yeah groups are moving

2526.39 --> 2533.08
a chocolate scene stop alright yeah

2530.65 --> 2535.9500000000003
Nathan's doesn't have a show today -

2533.08 --> 2535.95
thought so

2536.19 --> 2539.19
Oishi

2561.2 --> 2565.97
so yeah well that's going on

2566.98 --> 2572.82
oh yeah you have to mention this kind of

2570.099 --> 2572.82
shocked me

2573.61 --> 2581.58
Martin Lita's video was that was it

2578.59 --> 2581.58
Friday I think

2581.61 --> 2585.02
talking about these

2585.06 --> 2592.91
these new mud flats micro mud flows in

2588.69 --> 2596.12
Brazil and everything's like okay that

2592.91 --> 2596.12
was weird

2606.55 --> 2613.3
and yeah again I I have heard and seen

2610.27 --> 2617.58
that happen before or in that region a

2613.3 --> 2617.5800000000004
lot but

2620.47 --> 2628.2099999999996
it does spark the whole curiosity right

2623.41 --> 2632.2599999999998
now like how's that artificial was that

2628.21 --> 2635.8
some kind of sabotage what really went

2632.26 --> 2638.98
on it's a giant mystery it's gonna be

2635.8 --> 2641.4700000000003
pretty tough to figure that one out but

2638.98 --> 2644.22
it is kind of like staring now like yeah

2641.47 --> 2648.6899999999996
this could be more than just a standard

2644.22 --> 2648.6899999999996
random environmental event

2658.92 --> 2661.5190000000002
right

2668.97 --> 2675.64
a really multi-term town how how is it

2673.23 --> 2680.31
[ __ ]

2675.64 --> 2680.31
what about it is [ __ ]

2689.02 --> 2694.54
or is it just that that baller

2691.38 --> 2696.61
instinctive just outright dismiss

2694.54 --> 2699.0099999999998
anything that you just can't handle

2696.61 --> 2701.6800000000003
because you don't want things to be more

2699.01 --> 2704.59
complex please let it be simple we can't

2701.68 --> 2706.72
handle this other thing add it on to it

2704.59 --> 2710.65
that makes things even more frustrating

2706.72 --> 2714.31
and complex don't have that attention

2710.65 --> 2718.619
span please we just wanted to little

2714.31 --> 2718.619
globe nice and simple

2729.4 --> 2734.04
what is that what does that even mean

2735.69 --> 2740.43
look Multi TomTom if you're gonna be

2738.059 --> 2743.1600000000003
talking [ __ ] about people you're better

2740.43 --> 2745.8289999999997
damn well give a good reason for it or

2743.16 --> 2748.52
I'm gonna ban you again because that's

2745.829 --> 2751.17
the type of [ __ ] that I banned you for

2748.52 --> 2755.5389999999998
talking [ __ ] about other people without

2751.17 --> 2755.539
actually giving good reasons for them

2758.299 --> 2768.0
really Jamar how how is it [ __ ] I

2763.73 --> 2770.339
don't want to hear this but how how is

2768.0 --> 2772.369
it [ __ ] what is your proof that

2770.339 --> 2776.549
nothing like that happened

2772.369 --> 2780.829
bring it come on give me your arguments

2776.549 --> 2785.49
arguments not hand-wave dismissals real

2780.829 --> 2788.6400000000003
arguments why is it [ __ ] why did it

2785.49 --> 2794.4799999999996
not happen why is that not something

2788.64 --> 2794.48
that happened come on

2796.32 --> 2801.52
lack of ever

2798.7 --> 2807.06
really lack of evidence like all that

2801.52 --> 2812.56
photographic [ __ ] and reports mod

2807.06 --> 2815.47
historical records there's actually

2812.56 --> 2818.95
quite a lot of proof out there that that

2815.47 --> 2823.6899999999996
[ __ ] did happen maybe not as a coherent

2818.95 --> 2827.0499999999997
giant event maybe but yeah lots of mud

2823.69 --> 2833.28
flooding did happen in a certain time

2827.05 --> 2837.88
span worldwide maybe coordinated maybe

2833.28 --> 2840.55
coincidental maybe it was like a over

2837.88 --> 2843.4300000000003
frequency kind of thing I don't know but

2840.55 --> 2847.36
yeah that [ __ ] did definitely happen and

2843.43 --> 2849.3999999999996
mud has been excavated and I think that

2847.36 --> 2854.5
the Netherlands was probably mostly

2849.4 --> 2857.26
built because of the mud flood because

2854.5 --> 2861.07
the Dutch conveniently used all that

2857.26 --> 2863.8
excess mud to sculpt the new landscape

2861.07 --> 2867.9700000000003
and the dikes and everything it's very

2863.8 --> 2868.8300000000004
handy they industrialized working that

2867.97 --> 2873.5099999999998
out quickly

2868.83 --> 2873.5099999999998
because it yet does require

2874.68 --> 2883.68
people to act pretty quickly before the

2877.59 --> 2891.1200000000003
mud turns back to basic dirt and becomes

2883.68 --> 2897.87
not so moldable malleable so yeah it's

2891.12 --> 2903.06
just look Jim are you are laughable you

2897.87 --> 2908.54
are laughable there's somebody in chat

2903.06 --> 2911.7799999999997
that's just saying no this is stupid and

2908.54 --> 2911.7799999999997
that's it

2916.21 --> 2920.01
what's it gonna accomplish

2926.94 --> 2935.609
right well Joe Kovacs as I said it

2932.789 --> 2939.059
doesn't necessarily have to be a world

2935.609 --> 2942.93
wide over spanning event not like the

2939.059 --> 2948.44
original flood okay it could be a

2942.93 --> 2948.44
synchronized event many local mud floods

2949.49 --> 2956.1299999999997
but the thing is they do seem to appear

2953.19 --> 2960.78
in the roughly mostly in the same time

2956.13 --> 2963.059
span that is telling so no it doesn't

2960.78 --> 2966.599
have to be like oh my god suddenly

2963.059 --> 2972.78
everywhere but everything now not like

2966.599 --> 2977.28
that just probably a lot of local things

2972.78 --> 2981.48
happening and yeah mud in many different

2977.28 --> 2985.289
regions simultaneously it's not like

2981.48 --> 2989.039
suddenly like well or somebody pull turn

2985.289 --> 2990.869
off the mud stream and just mud pouring

2989.039 --> 2993.6600000000003
out from the heavens and everything is

2990.869 --> 2996.779
now covered in mud no that's not what

2993.66 --> 3002.029
that is can't believe you guys aren't

2996.779 --> 3005.029
just seeing that just your imaginations

3002.029 --> 3008.569
are so oversimplified I can't believe

3005.029 --> 3011.51
you're that basic stop being so damn

3008.569 --> 3015.77
basic and actually use your imagination

3011.51 --> 3018.73
to create a more real scenario more

3015.77 --> 3021.65
realistic scenarios of how things work

3018.73 --> 3027.279
you're always all for simplifying things

3021.65 --> 3027.279
it's lazy being lazy

3043.88 --> 3050.9300000000003
Oh Jim are really chemtrails chemtrails

3048.14 --> 3054.35
or the conspiracy chemtrails like

3050.93 --> 3058.6
remember that the footage I did on the

3054.35 --> 3062.54
debates livestream chemtrails just being

3058.6 --> 3064.91
weirdly shaped right in front of us so

3062.54 --> 3069.92
it's right there and this conspiracy is

3064.91 --> 3072.2599999999998
just this is not a real doesn't exist

3069.92 --> 3074.39
there's nothing there it's just our

3072.26 --> 3076.82
imagination even though that imagination

3074.39 --> 3079.48
can be recorded on camera it's just it's

3076.82 --> 3079.48
not real right

3097.56 --> 3102.66
right over Mukul well wherever as

3100.65 --> 3106.17
something new pops up there will be

3102.66 --> 3112.5299999999997
deniers as I said many many of people

3106.17 --> 3114.81
out here are here to basically stop the

3112.53 --> 3118.38
flow of information because they can't

3114.81 --> 3124.5
handle it because they're lazy mentally

3118.38 --> 3127.38
deficient [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] that just

3124.5 --> 3129.09
don't want to hear anymore and they know

3127.38 --> 3130.9500000000003
if they're gonna walk away then through

3129.09 --> 3132.57
other people they're gonna hear the new

3130.95 --> 3135.0299999999997
[ __ ] and they don't want it so they're

3132.57 --> 3137.7000000000003
doing anything just getting in our faces

3135.03 --> 3141.51
to try to make a shut up so it doesn't

3137.7 --> 3143.79
turn into more so we don't find out more

3141.51 --> 3147.0
they don't want to hear it they want it

3143.79 --> 3155.33
to stop it's the sleepers it's a form of

3147.0 --> 3160.08
madness its its intellectual cowardice

3155.33 --> 3162.39
that's exactly what it is and they are

3160.08 --> 3165.87
compelled by their intellectual

3162.39 --> 3168.3599999999997
cowardice to try and make us stop

3165.87 --> 3170.0699999999997
talking about it because if we talk

3168.36 --> 3172.35
about it then we may figure out more

3170.07 --> 3175.98
about it and then we may discover new

3172.35 --> 3178.77
subjects and more and they can they

3175.98 --> 3181.38
don't want to do that they don't want to

3178.77 --> 3183.42
know about it they don't want it they

3181.38 --> 3188.46
want nothing they want their freakin

3183.42 --> 3192.0
delusions to be the real thing they want

3188.46 --> 3194.4
to make their safe space imaginings into

3192.0 --> 3197.66
reality and for that everything else

3194.4 --> 3197.6600000000003
must be silenced

3199.15 --> 3213.94
yeah they that includes you if you do it

3207.279 --> 3217.289
then you are they get it you shall know

3213.94 --> 3217.289
them by their deeds

3232.47 --> 3237.79
the elite and bankers wants your soul

3235.51 --> 3241.15
not really they just want your money and

3237.79 --> 3245.37
they want control mostly the soul is

3241.15 --> 3248.92
just currency to them it's just a way to

3245.37 --> 3251.5
guarantee the control and the money

3248.92 --> 3255.55
really for them they don't give dinner

3251.5 --> 3260.79
want it give a [ __ ] about people so not

3255.55 --> 3260.79
a little bit just currency to them

3272.8 --> 3279.28
so yeah I think I will continue going

3277.27 --> 3282.45
with the show a little don't have any

3279.28 --> 3282.4500000000003
good reason not to

3303.43 --> 3319.6189999999997
now we'll see how long this goes before

3306.49 --> 3319.6189999999997
I end up kicking GMR I did [ __ ]

3326.46 --> 3334.16
anyone else want a timeout stand in the

3331.89 --> 3334.16
corner

3343.05 --> 3346.25
no Constance

3358.97 --> 3362.2099999999996
all right

3363.53 --> 3368.96
okay Oh me yoga yeah you're you're

3366.92 --> 3369.8
giving me a question and you know it's

3368.96 --> 3371.51
gonna be trouble

3369.8 --> 3373.79
so I'm gonna give you exactly what you

3371.51 --> 3377.15
asked for them what do you think is the

3373.79 --> 3380.5099999999998
purpose of life since your question the

3377.15 --> 3386.29
purpose of life is to find the purpose

3380.51 --> 3386.2900000000004
of life good luck

3419.63 --> 3422.4700000000003
hmm

3423.42 --> 3429.4500000000003
my constants and chocolate and Ronnie

3427.079 --> 3431.25
fashi hey if any of you or all of you

3429.45 --> 3437.1299999999997
you want to get on my panel and just

3431.25 --> 3440.059
talk they'll be great and welcome you

3437.13 --> 3442.4100000000003
know I've been talking for an hour and I

3440.059 --> 3444.559
hope you noticed that I'm doing really

3442.41 --> 3444.5589999999997
good

3448.83 --> 3453.2999999999997
maybe it is because of the new things

3451.23 --> 3455.19
that ever arrives on my path but I feel

3453.3 --> 3460.7000000000003
like the shakiness and everything is

3455.19 --> 3466.7400000000002
just completely gone now it really is

3460.7 --> 3469.08
cause I think it's weird because in a

3466.74 --> 3472.1699999999996
way it somewhat does seem like that the

3469.08 --> 3478.59
depression effect that over nervousness

3472.17 --> 3480.83
is caused by a lack of of things a lack

3478.59 --> 3480.83
of

3480.869 --> 3483.65
purpose

3485.079 --> 3492.279
and now that I engage in a new thing

3489.969 --> 3495.7290000000003
it's like that thing has always been

3492.279 --> 3500.89
entirely released it's like a clamp

3495.729 --> 3503.2189999999996
being taken off and somebody can breathe

3500.89 --> 3503.219
a lot better

3508.69 --> 3518.289
all right now Jose don't ya

3514.859 --> 3521.3089999999997
yeah you've been Jose's been kinda nice

3518.289 --> 3523.9300000000003
recently to me at least on my show

3521.309 --> 3526.059
because I didn't push him about Flat

3523.93 --> 3529.8689999999997
Earth in which he will reveal to be a

3526.059 --> 3531.3900000000003
total ball tart and a troll but yeah

3529.869 --> 3537.25
you've been nice to me and that was

3531.39 --> 3540.7599999999998
appreciated but I didn't become better

3537.25 --> 3547.9
because of you I didn't become better

3540.76 --> 3553.8590000000004
because of anything except the things

3547.9 --> 3559.48
that I chose to do and the rest is all

3553.859 --> 3563.67
assistance one level bigger level high

3559.48 --> 3563.67
level it's all assistance because yeah

3563.71 --> 3567.7400000000002
and yen's

3565.73 --> 3570.59
you can get all the help in the world

3567.74 --> 3574.33
only one that can actually change

3570.59 --> 3574.33
themselves is themselves

3578.34 --> 3582.01
so I'm gonna take full credit for that

3580.96 --> 3586.0
sorry

3582.01 --> 3588.2200000000003
not really I need to I don't want to I

3586.0 --> 3596.53
need to I need to realize yeah it is

3588.22 --> 3599.2
because of what what I'm deciding but

3596.53 --> 3601.75
yeah all of your support and your

3599.2 --> 3606.46
sympathies and empathise have all been

3601.75 --> 3609.12
very much appreciated and yeah I do

3606.46 --> 3609.12
thank you

3617.96 --> 3621.579
hey Sammy husky

3623.73 --> 3629.81
mmm yep build a wall walls everywhere

3637.1 --> 3640.42
walls are awesome

3644.99 --> 3649.16
and the funny thing is you never know

3647.21 --> 3655.16
what they're will turn out to be good

3649.16 --> 3657.2599999999998
for I think that on overall if you have

3655.16 --> 3660.1299999999997
a wall for whatever reason or from the

3657.26 --> 3663.5890000000004
past it will always bring more

3660.13 --> 3666.7000000000003
advantages than disadvantages no matter

3663.589 --> 3666.7
the scenario

3671.08 --> 3674.16
all saris good

3674.319 --> 3685.329
and yeah the very design of nature

3680.339 --> 3690.009
proves it because every every tree out

3685.329 --> 3696.579
there every cell has a wall each one of

3690.009 --> 3700.66
them and the skin is a wall very much so

3696.579 --> 3703.6600000000003
provably so so walls are everywhere it

3700.66 --> 3708.5789999999997
is essential for life to thrive for

3703.66 --> 3711.7889999999998
there to be walls so all this anti wall

3708.579 --> 3717.6090000000004
[ __ ] it is just it's a bunch of amoeba

3711.789 --> 3719.4990000000003
talk okay only amoebas hate walls so are

3717.609 --> 3722.0789999999997
you gonna be with the amoebas and hate

3719.499 --> 3725.1989999999996
walls or you're gonna be with the rest

3722.079 --> 3730.199
of life and actually be sensible about

3725.199 --> 3730.199
it you know

3771.099 --> 3775.9500000000003
nope

3773.41 --> 3775.95
keep

3781.81 --> 3790.99
and right indeed Ronnie fashi yeah walls

3784.9 --> 3795.4300000000003
will kinda stop or contain or keep out

3790.99 --> 3800.35
the mud flood mud flood things it will

3795.43 --> 3804.45
help contain damage be it mud flood

3800.35 --> 3804.45
being a horde of people

3806.06 --> 3811.25
it's not what's good yeah the only thing

3808.94 --> 3813.56
kind of doesn't contain any more is

3811.25 --> 3816.92
armies because yeah

3813.56 --> 3822.22
walls are not much of an obstacle to

3816.92 --> 3822.2200000000003
modern warfare and such

3824.73 --> 3830.53
or like

3827.28 --> 3833.619
conquering forces walls are not gonna be

3830.53 --> 3837.75
very good against conquering forces they

3833.619 --> 3840.78
may be good for secret attacks for

3837.75 --> 3845.17
environmental disasters for migration

3840.78 --> 3846.579
chaos for the spreading of disease is

3845.17 --> 3849.369
too you know

3846.579 --> 3853.26
a wall can be they say okay there's a

3849.369 --> 3857.32
plague or whatever close down that wall

3853.26 --> 3864.0890000000004
no more entering no more exiting it will

3857.32 --> 3864.089
help it contain just like in the body

3870.63 --> 3875.7200000000003
a weakened

3878.41 --> 3886.5789999999997
so yeah guys hey if any of you want to

3881.779 --> 3890.289
get on my panel I'm really open for it

3886.579 --> 3890.289
I'll put the link out

3890.74 --> 3894.8399999999997
njet on the master be

3907.57 --> 3916.51
no no I will not I will keep the stache

3914.07 --> 3919.9
goatee is never gonna work

3916.51 --> 3923.7700000000004
because I'm sorry my elfin genetics do

3919.9 --> 3929.02
not allow that and I will never shave my

3923.77 --> 3931.54
head unless some like bizarre radical

3929.02 --> 3935.35
statement or whatever and I don't plan

3931.54 --> 3937.33
to ever okay I've had long hair for more

3935.35 --> 3942.4
than two-thirds of my life and they plan

3937.33 --> 3945.61
to turn that into at least four-fifths

3942.4 --> 3950.08
of my life and hopefully even fifth

3945.61 --> 3950.6200000000003
sixth of my life you know how long it'll

3950.08 --> 3954.15
last

3950.62 --> 3956.56
but yeah even though there may be some

3954.15 --> 3960.04
airline recession and all that

3956.56 --> 3964.08
unfortunate side effect I will still

3960.04 --> 3964.08
retain it I'm not gonna be embarrassed

3976.65 --> 3985.079
Issa that's just weird no I know

3985.65 --> 3990.079
look

3987.44 --> 3993.289
even if you consider the hairline

3990.079 --> 3999.1090000000004
recession okay my dad just considerably

3993.289 --> 4007.6600000000003
older this hair over here that stays so

3999.109 --> 4009.3089999999997
it's never no I don't have the typical I

4007.66 --> 4013.8689999999997
guess what do you call it the Italian

4009.309 --> 4016.6600000000003
type hair or whatever so that's not how

4013.869 --> 4021.039
my hair works thank God I have a patch

4016.66 --> 4024.339
here and it'll stay forever so I'm never

4021.039 --> 4027.1800000000003
gonna look like that this is just not

4024.339 --> 4027.18
how I work

4070.42 --> 4073.0190000000002
yes

4079.81 --> 4082.47
my god

4084.97 --> 4087.6299999999997
that is weird

4095.099 --> 4102.06
no I'm also just gonna be looking

4097.5 --> 4108.049
exactly the way I do know you know if I

4102.06 --> 4111.599
get a lot looser like less nervous about

4108.049 --> 4115.829
my thingies and my personal issues then

4111.599 --> 4117.9890000000005
I might be able to start clouding it

4115.829 --> 4122.8189999999995
around a little bit more because that is

4117.989 --> 4127.7699999999995
a lot of fun just like in the indie yeah

4122.819 --> 4129.719
maybe I will do like props and backs do

4127.77 --> 4133.38
a little bit of great dress-up game here

4129.719 --> 4134.099
and there and just do sketches with it

4133.38 --> 4138.6900000000005
or something

4134.099 --> 4142.079
I like the idea at least but yeah it's

4138.69 --> 4144.5689999999995
not I'm not I'll have to get some real

4142.079 --> 4150.259
props for that first so that's probably

4144.569 --> 4155.179
gonna be a later stage of my career here

4150.259 --> 4155.179
let's get that camera first so

4155.88 --> 4162.59
like seriously the p900 camera there is

4158.88 --> 4165.96
so many things that I can do that

4162.59 --> 4168.54
it'll be paying off for at least the

4165.96 --> 4174.18
next decade if we make it that long

4168.54 --> 4178.95
together so yeah please do donate to my

4174.18 --> 4183.17
super chat and to my paypal if you got

4178.95 --> 4183.17
it and let's get it there

4192.739 --> 4200.8099999999995
because there's so much phenomena that

4196.16 --> 4204.23
can be studied in the sky alone and when

4200.81 --> 4209.75
I get on the move then yeah or Rison

4204.23 --> 4212.239
works you know I'd love to do it but

4209.75 --> 4214.45
yeah I can't afford that [ __ ] all by

4212.239 --> 4214.45
myself

4243.269 --> 4255.8
look Oh God why do I okay to the [ __ ]

4249.96 --> 4258.63
okay comes to my hair I'm just very

4255.8 --> 4264.749
careful with it in a sense

4258.63 --> 4269.3
I don't over treat it because that is

4264.749 --> 4272.789
the death of any hair you can ask

4269.3 --> 4275.28
professional hairdressers about it the

4272.789 --> 4281.55
more you work on it the more it's gonna

4275.28 --> 4284.4
damage grow old and even the skin that

4281.55 --> 4287.070000000001
basically spawns the hair the more you

4284.4 --> 4292.339999999999
it gets subjected to chemicals and [ __ ]

4287.07 --> 4296.369
and everything else it's gonna do great

4292.34 --> 4300.57
so to be fair I do as little as possible

4296.369 --> 4305.489
with my hair I don't wash it too often

4300.57 --> 4307.949
and that's really not a big problem if

4305.489 --> 4310.409
not washing your hair really becomes a

4307.949 --> 4313.259999999999
problem when you wash it almost every

4310.409 --> 4316.409
day and then you stop doing it because

4313.26 --> 4319.999
again it's the conditioning it parts of

4316.409 --> 4323.848999999999
your body or your entire body is used

4319.999 --> 4326.61
that the skin is being or whatever part

4323.849 --> 4328.7390000000005
is being washed constantly then it's

4326.61 --> 4330.808999999999
gonna be expecting that to happen it's

4328.739 --> 4333.15
going to be using that location as a

4330.809 --> 4335.7300000000005
dumping ground because hey it's gonna be

4333.15 --> 4340.079
cleaned up so only efficient to do that

4335.73 --> 4344.518999999999
so if you condition to wash your hair

4340.079 --> 4347.099
everyday then yeah your body's gonna

4344.519 --> 4350.719
have one hell of a task dumping stuff

4347.099 --> 4352.650000000001
over there even to just repair the skin

4350.719 --> 4355.079
from all the soap and everything

4352.65 --> 4359.61
exposure

4355.079 --> 4362.429
and yeah it will result in your hair

4359.61 --> 4365.67
getting a lot fattier a lot quicker and

4362.429 --> 4367.639
it your hair quality just aging more

4365.67 --> 4371.55
rapidly

4367.639 --> 4375.659000000001
that's all practical it's it really is

4371.55 --> 4383.639
practical this is I've learned this 20

4375.659 --> 4386.5199999999995
years ago from watching television it

4383.639 --> 4389.6990000000005
just cut it came to me it was like a

4386.52 --> 4394.9800000000005
fairy tale historical weird thingy in

4389.699 --> 4397.11
Dutch and there was a wizard guy or a

4394.98 --> 4400.11
druid or something and he said these

4397.11 --> 4405.2699999999995
things like yeah just wash your feet

4400.11 --> 4406.44
every day and I was inspired to do that

4405.27 --> 4409.9800000000005
and I did it

4406.44 --> 4413.25
I've been doing that ever since and it

4409.98 --> 4417.329
works it works amazingly it works so

4413.25 --> 4421.139
well my feet no they are the dumping

4417.329 --> 4422.82
ground my metabolism knows my feet are

4421.139 --> 4425.400000000001
the dumping ground if I don't wash my

4422.82 --> 4429.449
feet a day even just one day I can

4425.4 --> 4432.78
become sick because of it it's weird but

4429.449 --> 4435.419999999999
as for the rest as for constant

4432.78 --> 4438.98
showering and everything no don't need

4435.42 --> 4438.9800000000005
it I really do

4439.76 --> 4445.18
and it's probably saving me a lot on the

4442.61 --> 4450.3099999999995
food consumption in general as well

4445.18 --> 4452.42
because yeah my skin my metabolism

4450.31 --> 4455.330000000001
doesn't have to overcompensate

4452.42 --> 4460.27
constantly for all the washing and [ __ ]

4455.33 --> 4460.2699999999995
and soap that I subject myself service

4460.81 --> 4465.52
naturalism the druid way

4471.699 --> 4482.169999999999
yeah coconut oil bath holy [ __ ] that's

4479.46 --> 4487.179
that's something else I wouldn't do it

4482.17 --> 4494.469
every week really too much of a good

4487.179 --> 4497.02
thing is is rarely a good thing and yeah

4494.469 --> 4499.81
I do use coconut oil to you know

4497.02 --> 4501.820000000001
sometimes especially when after I skin I

4499.81 --> 4507.39
do especially during the winter times I

4501.82 --> 4510.989
do have skin issues it's very obvious

4507.39 --> 4514.5
and it's in the family I think

4510.989 --> 4519.459999999999
and it's also metabolic and

4514.5 --> 4521.98
psychosomatic it all coincides and you

4519.46 --> 4524.679
can work against that with with creams

4521.98 --> 4528.25
and coconut oil and all kinds of things

4524.679 --> 4530.59
and of course eating healthy very

4528.25 --> 4535.36
critical very critical to always eat

4530.59 --> 4537.66
healthy no matter what but yeah I'm not

4535.36 --> 4540.67
gonna do that every day I don't take

4537.66 --> 4544.8099999999995
these creams and just swap it on there

4540.67 --> 4547.36
every single day because that doesn't

4544.81 --> 4552.400000000001
really work on the long run and it's

4547.36 --> 4559.719
more expensive so yeah enough health &

4552.4 --> 4563.62
beauty tips from Arwen check with your

4559.719 --> 4567.179
doctor in your hairdresser before you

4563.62 --> 4567.179
proceed with my advice

4570.289 --> 4572.889
yep

4573.489 --> 4579.759999999999
I've discussed this whole issue - it's

4575.709 --> 4581.53
like some men explain like yeah but you

4579.76 --> 4583.719
don't really want a shower every day

4581.53 --> 4587.018999999999
it's not very healthy and they just just

4583.719 --> 4590.199
say or they're wide say it's like that's

4587.019 --> 4598.719
really nice but we want to be able to

4590.199 --> 4601.03
maintain smelling well I get that but

4598.719 --> 4603.369
it's a short-term solution if you

4601.03 --> 4605.53
basically adapt somebody's metabolism

4603.369 --> 4608.65
get them to eat really healthy which is

4605.53 --> 4611.099
very complicated also probably different

4608.65 --> 4615.098999999999
than they expect in the first place

4611.099 --> 4621.55
because it's mostly like organic no prep

4615.099 --> 4624.400000000001
food no crappie chemical products and

4621.55 --> 4627.849
[ __ ] and there's a great chance that

4624.4 --> 4632.219
then yeah the typical ultra stinky male

4627.849 --> 4638.139
smell will become a lot less thing here

4632.219 --> 4641.92
probably more manly or pheromone ik but

4638.139 --> 4645.91
not as vile because yes some

4641.92 --> 4649.51
really have that but yeah it's all up to

4645.91 --> 4652.599999999999
them you know do they want to go there I

4649.51 --> 4656.46
am luckily blessed with my elfin

4652.6 --> 4659.8
genetics not to be stinky naturally

4656.46 --> 4664.36
although we are when I was a teenager

4659.8 --> 4668.14
and I did still eat like yeah crappy

4664.36 --> 4671.32
chemical laced chips and coca-cola and

4668.14 --> 4676.5
all that yeah you it really does

4671.32 --> 4676.5
aggravate the smell in the stink a lot

4679.169 --> 4683.55
so whatever you're gonna be putting in

4680.88 --> 4690.719
your body it's gonna come out of there

4683.55 --> 4693.59
one way or the other just getting into a

4690.719 --> 4693.59
really silly

4697.66 --> 4700.86
it was a big clouding

4726.379 --> 4732.659
yeah

4728.129 --> 4736.349
yep therefore nitch says my girls always

4732.659 --> 4741.228999999999
told me I smell good with perfumer co2

4736.349 --> 4745.05
Colonia yeah it's really nice but I

4741.229 --> 4749.280000000001
can't stand any of that stuff it's

4745.05 --> 4753.209
rarely I can I do like the more etheric

4749.28 --> 4756.148999999999
oil type natural perfumes kind of nice

4753.209 --> 4760.889
they're okay I can handle it but any

4756.149 --> 4763.889
real perfume all that stuff is it is

4760.889 --> 4767.07
chemical warfare to me it literally

4763.889 --> 4774.769
gives me headaches literally gives me

4767.07 --> 4774.768999999999
headaches I hate that stuff

4820.84 --> 4823.9890000000005
following this

4858.73 --> 4868.049999999999
and this clouds pretty bad

4863.29 --> 4868.05
it's like a dark evening cloud that

4885.19 --> 4890.65
I betcha there's gonna be a lot of rain

4887.32 --> 4894.33
coming out of that just if the moment I

4890.65 --> 4894.33
try to go through it

4928.82 --> 4936.599999999999
let's see if I could bring up something

4931.11 --> 4939.8099999999995
else as well I think I probably

4936.6 --> 4943.29
forgot about some things they wanted to

4939.81 --> 4947.450000000001
talk about and I'm gonna try to round

4943.29 --> 4947.45
out the show as well

4949.489 --> 4956.62
nobody seems to be joining me anyway oh

4953.08 --> 4956.62
yeah there was this

4957.61 --> 4965.259999999999
they'll lift the veil it's a channel a

4960.33 --> 4970.51
guy also called Nathan Stockman I think

4965.26 --> 4973.09
and he is also includes Flat Earth in

4970.51 --> 4975.1
his subjects very interesting and but

4973.09 --> 4977.32
he's also a lot about just media

4975.1 --> 4982.660000000001
conspiracies and the narratives and I

4977.32 --> 4985.36
like it because he really gets it in a

4982.66 --> 4989.71
lot of ways what's going on he can see

4985.36 --> 4993.299999999999
through a lot just like kind of what I'm

4989.71 --> 4996.34
trying to do what I definitely do do and

4993.3 --> 4999.67
maybe even further than he does but he's

4996.34 --> 5004.53
just very eloquent but he does he had

4999.67 --> 5009.75
this really interesting video did joe

5004.53 --> 5011.3099999999995
rogan redeem himself and yeah it's worth

5009.75 --> 5015.24
watching there was some really

5011.31 --> 5018.660000000001
interesting call calls in yeah he does

5015.24 --> 5021.0
have people Skype call him I wonder

5018.66 --> 5024.2
sometimes how because I would like to

5021.0 --> 5024.2
Skype call him sometime

5027.719 --> 5031.32
but at least yeah he does have an open

5029.639 --> 5034.619
chat so you can always come up there I

5031.32 --> 5036.57
didn't see antlers days in there or he's

5034.619 --> 5042.57
yeah he noticed me and then said though

5036.57 --> 5048.09
as he always does and there's a the

5042.57 --> 5052.018999999999
great junkie that's fine it is fun to do

5048.09 --> 5054.900000000001
that but yeah what's interesting and my

5052.019 --> 5058.139
conclusion was yeah Joe Rogan definitely

5054.9 --> 5063.419
did not redeem himself he basically did

5058.139 --> 5067.579
is after having taken two steps backward

5063.419 --> 5070.459
he took one forward as sort of a

5067.579 --> 5074.82
temporary damage control

5070.459 --> 5078.38
soothing measure and he's definitely not

5074.82 --> 5083.759999999999
redeemed very blatantly obviously not

5078.38 --> 5087.419
and I can see that he's enjoying the

5083.76 --> 5092.189
[ __ ] out of doing what he does so I hope

5087.419 --> 5094.559
it's worth the price I hope he enjoys it

5092.189 --> 5097.789000000001
because it's gonna be one hell of a toll

5094.559 --> 5097.789
at the end I think

5109.56 --> 5114.92
but yeah dude check out mr. Vail Channel

5115.219 --> 5119.75
I'll link him up in chat probably many

5118.04 --> 5123.37
of you have already seen it it's a

5119.75 --> 5129.35
pretty pretty good Channel 80k

5123.37 --> 5135.13
subscribers he does a almost daily show

5129.35 --> 5135.13
not completely daily but I think

5136.989 --> 5144.94
yes sometimes daily sometimes more in

5141.4 --> 5147.67
one day but every now and then and yeah

5144.94 --> 5151.2
a lot of geopolitical things media

5147.67 --> 5155.08
things technology things social media

5151.2 --> 5158.17
censorship false flags a lot about false

5155.08 --> 5162.34
flagging and media stuff and CA

5158.17 --> 5166.62
Illuminati it's just very wide good

5162.34 --> 5166.62
channel and I appreciate him being there

5171.66 --> 5178.11
all right I guess his spots I heard of

5175.93 --> 5178.110000000001
him

5179.099 --> 5185.09
I think that even

5181.81 --> 5189.52
that the vo mentions him

5185.09 --> 5189.52
oh wait I think I know him

5198.61 --> 5201.54
mmm

5202.03 --> 5205.5599999999995
yeah I've seen him before I think

5217.139 --> 5220.1
oh that's interesting

5231.26 --> 5235.88
huh that's really interesting I'm

5233.78 --> 5238.79
looking at Jesse's spots and he has a

5235.88 --> 5240.62
video path to redemption for those baths

5238.79 --> 5243.14
in depression I'm gonna check that out

5240.62 --> 5247.13
I'm gonna see what kind of story he has

5243.14 --> 5249.9800000000005
concerning that was from the 8th of

5247.13 --> 5254.29
February two days ago so yeah I'm

5249.98 --> 5257.87
interested to see what his approach is

5254.29 --> 5262.46
since yeah I obviously threw out some of

5257.87 --> 5264.8
it myself and everybody has their own

5262.46 --> 5268.07
approach to this her own little struggle

5264.8 --> 5270.88
or big struggle so I'll check that out

5268.07 --> 5270.88
later

5314.82 --> 5320.67
any Frank Chrisman yeah he announced

5318.45 --> 5323.79
Nathan Oakley announced there he would

5320.67 --> 5328.17
not do shows this weekend because he

5323.79 --> 5332.25
needed a break because it's taking his

5328.17 --> 5337.76
its toll because I know Nathan pretty

5332.25 --> 5337.76
sure that he's quite busy with all of it

5338.96 --> 5345.53
he's a pro youtuber at this point and

5342.6 --> 5348.42
yeah if you take it very very seriously

5345.53 --> 5352.139999999999
then it's gonna take a lot of energy and

5348.42 --> 5357.47
effort and just keep everything running

5352.14 --> 5357.47
and he needs a break break too you know

5370.46 --> 5373.12
yep

5374.65 --> 5378.42
that's paramount what

5380.88 --> 5383.659000000001
every years

5403.5 --> 5411.7
don't wear she'll sleep to their defense

5406.72 --> 5420.87
it's hilarious you it's just a Larry's

5411.7 --> 5420.87
the hole she'll the she'll conspiracy

5421.71 --> 5433.96
this is brilliant the shield has become

5429.75 --> 5438.15
the boogeyman of social media because

5433.96 --> 5443.17
anybody can turn out to the issue right

5438.15 --> 5447.129999999999
Sheils hiding under your bed i just

5443.17 --> 5449.4400000000005
around the corner they may be your best

5447.13 --> 5450.13
friends and you won't even know it until

5449.44 --> 5453.79
it's too late

5450.13 --> 5455.62
until they reveal that it was all a lie

5453.79 --> 5458.61
and they turn out to be chills and you

5455.62 --> 5462.18
were fooled and you feel so stupid now

5458.61 --> 5462.179999999999
chills everywhere

5464.749 --> 5472.57
I think the Sheol is the new boogeyman

5469.639 --> 5472.57
of social media

5481.939 --> 5487.820000000001
and yeah technically of course there are

5484.369 --> 5491.808999999999
shields out there it's very obvious but

5487.82 --> 5495.228999999999
it's it really isn't all that

5491.809 --> 5499.4890000000005
overarching it's not that big it's

5495.229 --> 5503.51
usually just like hey I'll pay you if

5499.489 --> 5507.379999999999
you promote this can you thread it into

5503.51 --> 5510.169
what you're doing yeah cool get few

5507.38 --> 5515.59
people some money and they add it to the

5510.169 --> 5515.59
story and they that's it

5516.86 --> 5522.86
and it probably very rarely even happens

5520.28 --> 5526.489
because people just talk about whatever

5522.86 --> 5531.5199999999995
they can find just to be able to talk

5526.489 --> 5534.29
about something so I think the real

5531.52 --> 5538.780000000001
social engineers corporatist they don't

5534.29 --> 5542.3
even need to pay people to show for them

5538.78 --> 5544.4
they just need to have them some ideas

5542.3 --> 5547.67
just put out suggestions through

5544.4 --> 5549.92
anything just a couple of words a couple

5547.67 --> 5554.4490000000005
of sentences here and there and people

5549.92 --> 5558.159
will take that voluntarily and make it

5554.449 --> 5561.28
their own because it's something new

5558.159 --> 5564.83
ever thought about that

5561.28 --> 5567.34
have you noticed yourself actually doing

5564.83 --> 5570.199
that without really even realizing it

5567.34 --> 5572.6900000000005
you come you come across something it

5570.199 --> 5574.25
feels really appealing it's really cool

5572.69 --> 5575.869
you feel oh there's so much more to

5574.25 --> 5578.05
learn about this and you make it your

5575.869 --> 5578.049999999999
own

5578.23 --> 5584.419999999999
did it even matter where it came from

5581.239 --> 5585.379999999999
how dubious the channel or the source

5584.42 --> 5590.03
even looked

5585.38 --> 5592.7300000000005
you had that sometimes but

5590.03 --> 5596.33
if it really appeals you to you you're

5592.73 --> 5600.44
going to take it anyway and you're gonna

5596.33 --> 5603.86
be the one working on that and spreading

5600.44 --> 5609.86
the idea and you're gonna do it all for

5603.86 --> 5618.49
free so yeah how many chills really are

5609.86 --> 5618.49
out there you know just saying

5624.88 --> 5629.88
yeah ohm yoga I think you got the point

5627.52 --> 5629.88
there

5633.05 --> 5638.75
the real point is is not to ask too many

5635.93 --> 5644.84
questions because she can't handle the

5638.75 --> 5650.03
answers Celeste and I have to learn have

5644.84 --> 5653.33
had to learn myself because once you

5650.03 --> 5654.889999999999
start to understand too much then you

5653.33 --> 5659.72
start to figure out that you can't

5654.89 --> 5662.110000000001
handle it and that was the point of my

5659.72 --> 5662.110000000001
answer

5663.53 --> 5670.599999999999
even though it is absolutely true it's

5666.71 --> 5673.6
just true in a way that is very hard to

5670.6 --> 5673.6
grasp

5686.75 --> 5697.22
nice you it's nice self full full

5691.53 --> 5697.219999999999
shilling prophecy now that is a mean

5766.929 --> 5769.59
yeah

5774.29 --> 5779.99
it's gone for two hours still no guests

5778.25 --> 5783.88
would have been nice

5779.99 --> 5783.88
although yeah this seems to be working

5789.28 --> 5792.54
[Applause]

5802.05 --> 5805.14
[Applause]

5836.889 --> 5845.28
that you guys are enjoying all this

5839.94 --> 5845.28
though my Big Sight silent pauses

5850.59 --> 5858.1900000000005
yeah I'm not expecting any guests soon

5853.719 --> 5860.619
even though I've opened it up but yeah I

5858.19 --> 5865.21
think I will probably end up rounding

5860.619 --> 5867.54
out the show somewhere next five to ten

5865.21 --> 5867.54
minutes

5868.11 --> 5872.46
please in the meantime yeah if you

5870.87 --> 5875.94
haven't already subscribed to my channel

5872.46 --> 5878.04
and for the video if elected our

5875.94 --> 5880.29
downfall in a virtual either way it's

5878.04 --> 5886.95
fine the vote is a vote you know down

5880.29 --> 5890.15
vote is hate speech HP true but yeah if

would be very appreciated if you did if

5902.34 --> 5908.85
you can't then donate to my paypal which

5905.82 --> 5914.24

5908.85 --> 5916.77
it or yeah roll in the the super chat

5914.24 --> 5919.639999999999

was it

5919.82 --> 5924.469
was from New Zealand I remember New

5922.61 --> 5927.348999999999
Zealand Dollars anyway thank you for

5924.469 --> 5929.9890000000005
that again any any little bit will help

5927.349 --> 5932.17
in the long run it's always good you

5929.989 --> 5932.169999999999
know

5933.85 --> 5938.71
it's better to get thousands and

5936.46 --> 5941.14
thousands of very little amounts that

5938.71 --> 5944.2
just getting nothing I'm hoping for that

5941.14 --> 5949.39
one big score it's never really works

5944.2 --> 5956.7699999999995
out does it really doesn't anyway yeah

5949.39 --> 5958.900000000001

5963.46 --> 5969.61
hopefully Nathan will also have

5966.09 --> 5973.93
restarted the debates again then which

5969.61 --> 5975.46
should precede my show

5973.93 --> 5978.04
it doesn't today so that's why I'm

5975.46 --> 5985.27
letting it just roll on roll on and see

5978.04 --> 5988.68
how long I can take it what gym Panda is

5985.27 --> 5988.68
in chat where

5989.3 --> 5993.34
I think I probably got him blocked

5994.09 --> 5998.499
because he is such an [ __ ]

5999.9 --> 6005.049999999999
I think I got him blocked I don't see

6002.6 --> 6005.05
him anywhere

6021.97 --> 6026.59
yeah

6023.949 --> 6028.98
for good evening Constance thanks for

6026.59 --> 6028.9800000000005
popping by

6035.689 --> 6041.349
oh my god all these people out there you

6039.229 --> 6041.349
know

6043.58 --> 6049.2699999999995
can you even imagine what people like

6046.4 --> 6053.299999999999
Patricia stare how it must be to them

6049.27 --> 6055.1
not not being all you have to grieve for

6053.3 --> 6057.35
them or something but they are like

6055.1 --> 6060.22
total socialites in the sense that they

6057.35 --> 6064.13
are net workers they're always digging

6060.22 --> 6066.26
digging finding new people and they sort

6064.13 --> 6069.17
of try to keep track of it can you

6066.26 --> 6073.7300000000005
imagine how many people she must have in

6069.17 --> 6077.42
her list is like oh my god it's like

6073.73 --> 6080.87
counting the sand on the beach or

6077.42 --> 6084.65
something and yeah I do know a lot of

6080.87 --> 6087.29
people from from YouTube from who I've

6084.65 --> 6090.61
been on hangouts with and everything and

6087.29 --> 6093.29
yeah especially now my my early-bird

6090.61 --> 6097.91
followers people that come here daily

6093.29 --> 6099.65
that really are supportive of me and but

6097.91 --> 6101.78
there's still so many people like before

6099.65 --> 6105.259999999999
that during the flat earth talks time

6101.78 --> 6107.599999999999
they were dealing with I forget about

6105.26 --> 6110.51
them sometimes so like like vegan

6107.6 --> 6113.4800000000005
warrior like oh wait yeah damn that guy

6110.51 --> 6116.3
Evan heard from him in a while and yet

6113.48 --> 6119.15
so many accounts deleted blocked because

6116.3 --> 6121.1
of his false flag coverage and then in

6119.15 --> 6123.92
making new accounts and then getting

6121.1 --> 6125.660000000001
blocked again I I didn't I wasn't even

6123.92 --> 6131.0
sure if he was still around doing

6125.66 --> 6134.72
YouTube but apparently is I guess

6131.0 --> 6137.21
so many flat earthers or people that

6134.72 --> 6141.320000000001
have been part of the Flat Earth scene

6137.21 --> 6143.84
or did something with it out there and I

6141.32 --> 6145.67
have no idea what they're doing what

6143.84 --> 6149.42
their stands have become what they've

6145.67 --> 6155.84
been focusing on because it's so much

6149.42 --> 6158.6900000000005
it's so many people and they're not very

6155.84 --> 6161.4800000000005
basic people people that get into Flat

6158.69 --> 6165.46
Earth are rarely basic people so they

6161.48 --> 6169.4
all have rich growth patterns and

6165.46 --> 6172.64
developments and ways they made

6169.4 --> 6174.62
decisions it's not it's not a bunch of

6172.64 --> 6177.92
simpletons even though the globe is

6174.62 --> 6181.04
loved to think that they are how the

6177.92 --> 6183.68
irony is thick that that is exactly what

6181.04 --> 6188.06
they are and they don't even know it

6183.68 --> 6192.5
ignorance is bliss but it would be good

6188.06 --> 6195.43
to maybe dig back a bit and see what

6192.5 --> 6195.43
everybody else is doing

6197.209 --> 6202.159
yeah I'm not gonna join this card and

6199.789 --> 6204.438999999999
I'm getting kind of sick of people

6202.159 --> 6207.259999999999
asking me this [ __ ] I'm not gonna enjoy

6204.439 --> 6211.429
this card never never never never never

6207.26 --> 6215.229
never only way I could ever join this

6211.429 --> 6219.11
card is if it universally and

6215.229 --> 6222.559
permanently changes it name its name to

6219.11 --> 6225.909
something else entirely and that's the

6222.559 --> 6225.909000000001
only way it's ever going to happen

6232.59 --> 6239.08
right this court is accessible and I

6235.989 --> 6241.629999999999
don't want to go there you know it's

6239.08 --> 6245.71
enough trouble wiping off all the troll

6241.63 --> 6248.25
crap from my shoulders as I do this show

6245.71 --> 6248.25
you know

6257.19 --> 6263.129999999999
swiping it all off now if I go in there

6260.17 --> 6275.92

6263.13 --> 6277.900000000001
cesspool am I gonna do there of course

6275.92 --> 6281.1990000000005
immediately and know what's gonna happen

6277.9 --> 6283.57
like all these trolls are so absurdly

6281.199 --> 6286.839999999999
predictable as soon as I do that they'd

6513.78 --> 6519.75
what I like to do in YouTube pretty more

6515.79 --> 6522.36
summing up besides I got in love with

6519.75 --> 6525.719
taking footage because of the flattered

6522.36 --> 6527.509999999999
global discussion going on what I'd like

6525.719 --> 6530.55
to do is taking footage that's it and

6527.51 --> 6532.860000000001
yeah I don't know if that's gonna dry up

6530.55 --> 6535.83
or it's gonna become something that I'm

6532.86 --> 6537.389
gonna just leave the camera in itself to

6535.83 --> 6539.699
get dusty you know it's not going to

6537.389 --> 6542.400000000001
happen I just love taking foolish now

6539.699 --> 6544.44
he's like a be missing out I got the

6542.4 --> 6546.75
smaller the smaller camera that I had

6544.44 --> 6550.049999999999
before he said 30 times though is not a

6546.75 --> 6552.679
P 900 it's a smaller camera I can mail

6554.849 --> 6560.099
address out I'll pay the shipping he

6557.909 --> 6565.489
said as I say it's not a bigger camera

6560.099 --> 6569.1900000000005
but he said 30 times zoom canon

6565.489 --> 6571.5599999999995
powershot something something can we can

6569.19 --> 6576.199
do that but the p900 I'm really using a

6571.56 --> 6580.080000000001
mirror I got Drive for it yeah yeah I

6576.199 --> 6584.848999999999
have to get that serious you know what I

6580.08 --> 6587.159
mean for real for real

6584.849 --> 6589.110000000001
I was thinking even before when I woke

6587.159 --> 6591.509999999999
up before I click in the show I was

6589.11 --> 6593.848999999999
thinking I got this small camera I was

6591.51 --> 6596.070000000001
gonna give it to my niece this the one I

6593.849 --> 6599.04
had the one I bought I had bought that

6596.07 --> 6601.049999999999
one in Florida before I got the penis on

6599.04 --> 6603.389
it I was gonna give it to my knees my

6601.05 --> 6606.360000000001
little knees but then the mom gave her a

6603.389 --> 6608.429
better camera you know he is or whatever

6606.36 --> 6610.348999999999
so I was thinking what to do I was

6608.429 --> 6612.119
thinking I will will be a good you know

6610.349 --> 6613.9800000000005
just from the window you know to zoom in

6612.119 --> 6616.949
a little bit I mean it does really good

6613.98 --> 6618.959999999999
foolish the little camera so I don't

6616.949 --> 6621.2699999999995
know if you want for real I'll mail it

6618.96 --> 6622.679
to you soon you know you're probably in

6621.27 --> 6630.4490000000005
the next one you probably got it on

6622.679 --> 6633.6900000000005
handle that was unexpected but well

6630.449 --> 6634.829
maybe I don't know I I would carve like

6633.69 --> 6637.768999999999
a p900

6634.829 --> 6640.289
because then I then I got like

6637.769 --> 6645.409000000001
everything I will need for various

6640.289 --> 6649.018999999999
things but I will keep the offer in mind

6645.409 --> 6652.228999999999
yeah yeah when I bought this small one I

6649.019 --> 6654.570000000001
was looking on Craigslist and Facebook

6652.229 --> 6656.939
market because I couldn't afford p900

6654.57 --> 6659.728999999999
you know it's just too expensive and the

6656.939 --> 6660.149
p90 1000 wasn't out or was about to come

6659.729 --> 6664.679
out

6660.149 --> 6666.539000000001
so I found this one for over $125 so I

6664.679 --> 6668.579
bought it I did a little disordered a

6666.539 --> 6671.82
little arrangement and I bought it for

6668.579 --> 6673.438999999999
under 25 bucks and it's good it's the

6671.82 --> 6674.999
first videos that I put that I presented

6673.439 --> 6677.189
a bunch in the night and show with the

6674.999 --> 6679.949
boats and all the good stuff you know

6677.189 --> 6686.01
right it was yeah that one's it's pretty

6679.949 --> 6691.379
ok it is it's it's a good stepping stone

6686.01 --> 6693.539000000001
for the bigger thing but yet you don't

6691.379 --> 6697.8
have to send it to me I do really

6693.539 --> 6701.07
appreciate the gesture though it's but

6697.8 --> 6703.05
yeah look I've been saying p900

6701.07 --> 6706.558999999999
for such a long time I want the peanut

6703.05 --> 6708.839
hungry yes I understand surely on this

6706.559 --> 6710.609
pair look it shouldn't even be that

6708.839 --> 6714.079
expensive anymore it's not the latest

6710.609 --> 6718.109
model there's already been mass

6714.079 --> 6718.558999999999
production deals and everything going on

6718.109 --> 6720.359
with it

6718.559 --> 6722.6990000000005
so it shouldn't be that tough and I

6720.359 --> 6725.6990000000005
think I can probably buy it with my

6722.699 --> 6730.678999999999
super chat money pretty quickly probably

6725.699 --> 6734.219
with before the summer starts yeah I had

6730.679 --> 6737.01
a chat with Jaron through Skype you week

6734.219 --> 6739.439
week and a half ago about the situation

6737.01 --> 6741.089
you know and I told him what happened

6739.439 --> 6743.309
you know I went back to the globe blah

6741.089 --> 6744.869
blah blah and we had a little back and

6743.309 --> 6748.379
forward and then I think the last

6744.869 --> 6750.3589999999995
message that he sent me about the p900

6748.379 --> 6753.809
you know we trashing the little subject

6750.359 --> 6756.539000000001
because he was his and he said I can't

6753.809 --> 6759.899
complain with that you know so yeah I'm

6756.539 --> 6761.07
a before that he said like you know just

6759.899 --> 6763.229
keep doing what you're doing you know

6761.07 --> 6765.139
take take the videos upload and don't

6763.229 --> 6768.4490000000005
help anything back and let us analyze

6765.139 --> 6770.67
and he can't complain I mean he can't

6768.449 --> 6774.03
disagree with my position because I'm a

6770.67 --> 6777.4490000000005
I'm a I'm a unique person I got my own

6774.03 --> 6779.19
thoughts and ideas but as for it's not

6777.449 --> 6782.04
that I got the P 900 and I'm gonna

6779.19 --> 6782.879999999999
either sale it or leave it home without

6782.04 --> 6785.94
using it

6782.88 --> 6789.75
so the intention and they use for the P

6785.94 --> 6791.82
900 it was to be used take it out the

6789.75 --> 6793.77
adventurous keep the eyes open for

6791.82 --> 6795.179
everything and I will continue to do

6793.77 --> 6802.38
that you know I'm like yeah you don't

6795.179 --> 6805.4
look we know okay it's just that people

6802.38 --> 6809.07
have been helping you out

6805.4 --> 6811.71
not because they just want footage but

6809.07 --> 6814.38
because they want a flat earther to do

6811.71 --> 6816.78
it and that's where that whole thing

6814.38 --> 6822.39
comes from that's why people are pissed

6816.78 --> 6825.449
off because yeah but you have to be fair

6822.39 --> 6827.6990000000005
you you can definitely interpret it it's

6825.449 --> 6830.099999999999
not completely rational to do it like

6827.699 --> 6832.889999999999
that but you can't interpret it as you

6830.1 --> 6835.679
act it like a flat earther to get your

6832.89 --> 6839.25
hands on the camera and then you flip

6835.679 --> 6841.1990000000005
flop back to your natural state and it's

6839.25 --> 6842.61
like yeah I got my camera now from the

6841.199 --> 6845.37
flat earthers and I'm just gonna enjoy

6842.61 --> 6847.259999999999
it and make good footage and you do make

6845.37 --> 6850.04
good footage and then you speculate

6847.26 --> 6853.070000000001
whatever the hell you want about it

6850.04 --> 6856.17
that's what you've been doing so there's

6853.07 --> 6860.04
people still feel like yeah you tricked

6856.17 --> 6865.16
us so that's why I suggested maybe if

6860.04 --> 6868.949
you just send it to us to atone then

6865.16 --> 6872.03
relief from your karmic burden and I

6868.949 --> 6872.03
will have my p900

6874.01 --> 6878.34
when I come to Natori all mine I can

6876.6 --> 6881.31
understand what why people think that

6878.34 --> 6884.610000000001
but realistically and humanly 13 I mean

6881.31 --> 6887.7300000000005
how can a person a sane person like me a

6884.61 --> 6889.259999999999
younger guy am I mean my in 43 but I'm

6887.73 --> 6891.239
still a younger guy you know how am I

6889.26 --> 6893.87
gonna waste like everyone in half two

6891.239 --> 6895.53
years solid in the Daily Show's

6893.87 --> 6897.42
participating you know having these

6895.53 --> 6899.91
hidden arguments and do being in this

6897.42 --> 6902.28
neighborhood just because of a camera

6899.91 --> 6904.92
yeah no I'll oh I lost I lost

6902.28 --> 6907.41
more than that I lost respect from

6904.92 --> 6908.31
family and real people won't work and

6907.41 --> 6910.83
friends you know

6908.31 --> 6912.81
so yeah it's nonsense with some people

6910.83 --> 6914.19
with that conspiratorial mind I know

6912.81 --> 6916.110000000001
isn't know you I know you're just joking

6914.19 --> 6918.419999999999
but some people really believe that I

6916.11 --> 6920.4
came to this Florida and I was being

6918.42 --> 6923.58
friendly and this thing just to have a

6920.4 --> 6927.089999999999
camera to scare people and I mean it

6923.58 --> 6931.05
just makes no sense whatsoever it does

6927.09 --> 6935.22
make a little sense but yeah it's it's

6931.05 --> 6942.0
just a complicated works of different

6935.22 --> 6943.77
things simultaneously we all got our the

6942.0 --> 6945.45
ideas you know it's all good I mean

6943.77 --> 6950.160000000001
we're in this we are all conspiratorial

6945.45 --> 6952.41
mind you know yeah yeah it's hard to get

6950.16 --> 6956.19
away from that when you deal when you're

6952.41 --> 6961.65
dealing with such a big subject so many
