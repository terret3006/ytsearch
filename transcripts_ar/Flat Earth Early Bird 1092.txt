[Music]

151.2 --> 155.83999999999997
it took a little longer than i thought

process because it was kind of in that

163.28 --> 167.04
direction anyway

165.04 --> 169.04
so i'll just be sitting through the flat

167.04 --> 171.2
earth debate without

169.04 --> 174.239
going for groceries there

171.2 --> 174.23899999999998
right now hold on

180.239 --> 184.64000000000001
anyway

181.44 --> 187.2
hello bill nye the science denier

184.64 --> 188.23899999999998
it's monday the 6th

187.2 --> 191.83999999999997
of

188.239 --> 193.68
december 2021

191.84 --> 197.08
hello stopping traffic in my rest ahead

193.68 --> 197.08
good to see you

198.319 --> 200.56
ah

202.64 --> 207.599
yeah it was a little tense again today

205.28 --> 209.44
at an appointment with my social worker

207.599 --> 212.159
and basically discussed the situation

209.44 --> 214.4
that had happened and everything and

212.159 --> 217.12
like that yeah

214.4 --> 217.12
i'll be alright

218.799 --> 223.92000000000002
like we ended up basically because my

221.2 --> 226.23899999999998
financial situation is fixed

223.92 --> 228.48
i could say well at least for the time

226.239 --> 230.56
being thanks to the generous support of

228.48 --> 233.76
all the people that donated

230.56 --> 235.92000000000002
in response to my fundraiser

233.76 --> 239.519
last

235.92 --> 241.35999999999999
thursday no wait was it friday

239.519 --> 242.799
i don't remember i think yeah it was

241.36 --> 243.92000000000002
friday i think

242.799 --> 245.12
uh

243.92 --> 247.28
so yeah

245.12 --> 251.12
we just ended up talking basically

247.28 --> 253.92
societal talk and psychology like

251.12 --> 256.479
because he is like he dabbles in

253.92 --> 260.4
psychology himself being a social worker

256.479 --> 260.4
so we kind of like cross

260.72 --> 265.12
we yeah we crossed our knowledge like

263.36 --> 266.56
okay what are you seeing in the field

265.12 --> 268.8
what am i seeing in the field in

266.56 --> 271.44
relation to like the

268.8 --> 273.04
all the lockdown situation the political

271.44 --> 276.16
situation and

273.04 --> 279.04
people's behavior also online that's

276.16 --> 281.759
kind of been a big subject

279.04 --> 284.32
because there is a

281.759 --> 284.32
kind of a

285.759 --> 291.68
intellectual degeneration artration i

288.72 --> 293.52000000000004
called it going on for a while now

291.68 --> 296.40000000000003
and now that the pressure is getting

293.52 --> 298.24
higher it's getting worse

296.4 --> 300.56
i think stubborn trafficking arrest had

298.24 --> 304.8
also is very well aware of this

300.56 --> 306.16
we sometimes discuss this over skype

304.8 --> 307.44
and yeah

306.16 --> 308.88000000000005
the guy

307.44 --> 311.6
happens to be a guy

308.88 --> 314.08
agreed like he's seeing that too on his

311.6 --> 317.199
side so it's not just

314.08 --> 320.0
the flat earthers or anything no it's

317.199 --> 320.0
a lot of people

320.32 --> 324.4
they're all kind of like

322.16 --> 325.91900000000004
buckling on the distress and then going

324.4 --> 328.15999999999997
on

325.919 --> 331.44
auto trust mode so they started blur

328.16 --> 334.32000000000005
they start blurting out things

331.44 --> 336.71999999999997
because they're on that perceived side

334.32 --> 339.68
yet they don't know actually what

336.72 --> 343.03900000000004
they're saying when you inquire

339.68 --> 346.88
and that's becoming more rampant

343.039 --> 346.88
out there on all sides

349.68 --> 356.0
right so we ended up discussing that

353.199 --> 357.52000000000004
sexton flat earth failure

356.0 --> 358.319
yeah

357.52 --> 362.71999999999997
no

358.319 --> 362.72
there's no flat earth sextant failure

363.84 --> 368.56
keep gaslighting yourself keep

366.08 --> 371.88
gaslighting yourself keep glass lighting

368.56 --> 371.88
yourself buddy

385.759 --> 388.08000000000004
right

390.319 --> 395.03900000000004
so yeah yes this stream was cool

392.96 --> 397.52
i actually watched it all back also

395.039 --> 400.15999999999997
because there were not that many live

397.52 --> 401.52
streams out there

400.16 --> 403.759
watched it back and it was very

401.52 --> 406.88
satisfied i titled it

403.759 --> 406.88
based on the subjects

407.52 --> 410.79999999999995
it was yeah i really liked that the

409.599 --> 412.0
horse part

410.8 --> 414.0
it was kind of

412.0 --> 417.28
interesting to

414.0 --> 417.28
think back about all that

419.12 --> 425.599
all those decades ago

423.039 --> 429.199

425.599 --> 431.12

480.08 --> 486.0
on netflix and

482.56 --> 488.4
it was really like nice

486.0 --> 488.4
anyway

491.28 --> 497.44
yeah keep gaslighting yourself there cvx

495.36 --> 499.599
it's not gonna work

497.44 --> 502.4
no the earth is flat there's nothing you

499.599 --> 502.4
can do about it

502.879 --> 508.16
except gaslight yourself like no oh you

505.68 --> 511.28000000000003
failed no no you're the one that filled

508.16 --> 513.6800000000001
you have absolutely no more grip

511.28 --> 516.88
on how to deal

513.68 --> 520.159
with this mechanical based evidence

516.88 --> 523.599
it's obviously been utilized in the past

520.159 --> 524.88
and it it doesn't work

523.599 --> 527.0400000000001
the things you're

524.88 --> 530.32
the the ballers are now trying to

527.04 --> 532.959
suggest on how the sextant operates

530.32 --> 535.12
uh yeah the past doesn't reflect that at

532.959 --> 537.92
all

535.12 --> 539.12
like we're talking about a

537.92 --> 541.76
widely

539.12 --> 543.04
used instrument that was critical for

541.76 --> 546.0
that era

543.04 --> 548.64
there's no descriptions of these

546.0 --> 552.0
supposed applications on the globe at

548.64 --> 553.1999999999999
all not even a hint of that it's all

552.0 --> 556.8
make believe

553.2 --> 558.88
and nobody's buying it except those that

556.8 --> 562.0799999999999
are religious zealots so

558.88 --> 565.12
keep gas and gliding yourself

562.08 --> 565.12
because it ain't working

568.8 --> 576.3599999999999
hello george sanford

571.76 --> 576.36
mike sidunich captain caveman

582.38 --> 585.429
[Music]

589.279 --> 594.0
it amazes me along we've been using sex

591.36 --> 596.16
since how long we didn't realize excuse

594.0 --> 596.16
me

597.2 --> 601.12
no no that's not true because

602.8 --> 608.24
the time in the times when the sextant

605.12 --> 609.839
was still being widely used

608.24 --> 612.24
there was no

609.839 --> 615.2
glow propaganda like this

612.24 --> 617.279
the people that used it absolutely knew

615.2 --> 619.2
the earth was flat they knew it they

617.279 --> 622.56
knew it they had to know it they would

619.2 --> 622.5600000000001
have to be in on it

623.519 --> 627.36
right

624.32 --> 629.279
and yeah we don't realize it current day

627.36 --> 631.279
because yeah who's he was going to use a

629.279 --> 633.519
sexton right

631.279 --> 635.6
it's like an old instrument it's an old

633.519 --> 637.6
curiosity instrument that's kind of like

635.6 --> 639.44
how i see it

637.6 --> 642.64
so yeah if it's not a thing that

639.44 --> 645.6800000000001
somebody's constantly using

642.64 --> 648.16
then yeah how would we even know it only

645.68 --> 651.04
works on a flat earth at first

648.16 --> 653.68
it requires somebody to actually master

651.04 --> 656.959
it how it works

653.68 --> 660.76
and yeah we've got some of these people

656.959 --> 660.76
10th man for example

664.64 --> 668.24
what about four years ago well four

666.8 --> 669.88
years ago

668.24 --> 672.88
there was still a lot of general

669.88 --> 675.76
misunderstanding even on the nature of

672.88 --> 677.76
optics we still were in the

675.76 --> 680.0
mistaken assumption

677.76 --> 681.4399999999999
that the horizon was geometric and so

680.0 --> 683.2
were the ballers even though they

681.44 --> 685.2790000000001
claimed they never had a geometric

683.2 --> 686.72
horizon right now

685.279 --> 689.4399999999999
or at least some of them do and then

686.72 --> 690.9590000000001
they say oh no no it is we do we do no

689.44 --> 693.0400000000001
no no we don't have a geometric rights

690.959 --> 697.4799999999999
we do we do right

693.04 --> 697.48
but back then we didn't know

705.32 --> 708.6400000000001
[Music]

707.279 --> 713.079
right

708.64 --> 713.079

781.76 --> 785.04
stupid

783.839 --> 787.9200000000001
questions

785.04 --> 790.48
i mean i'm not gonna answer them so

787.92 --> 793.519
after those stupid gas light attempts

790.48 --> 795.36
no just piss off

793.519 --> 797.6

795.36 --> 801.839
insist on whining like this i'm just

797.6 --> 801.839
gonna ban you i don't care

806.32 --> 808.5600000000001

little gadget inspector

818.079 --> 822.4799999999999
why not

819.6 --> 826.44
because i'm not here to answer your

822.48 --> 826.44
stupid basic questions

833.44 --> 838.8000000000001
it's not relevant to how the sextants

835.279 --> 841.6
work either but just in general

838.8 --> 843.4399999999999
like i i know this pattern come in start

841.6 --> 846.32
gaslighting oh this doesn't work that

843.44 --> 849.44
doesn't work and then ask stupid

846.32 --> 850.5600000000001
questions one after another

849.44 --> 853.519
i'm not gonna

850.56 --> 853.5189999999999
i'm not gonna bite

854.079 --> 861.079
you can take your stupid troll routines

856.639 --> 861.0790000000001
somewhere else and shove it

875.6 --> 878.6
so

895.519 --> 898.519
perhaps

899.92 --> 903.8789999999999

didn't go to bed too late or anything

925.839 --> 928.839
but

949.519 --> 954.48
yeah we know cvx you are presupposing

952.079 --> 957.7589999999999
the earth being a sphere and that's the

954.48 --> 957.759
orientation we get it

958.24 --> 963.6800000000001
we know the routine

960.88 --> 966.72

1017.279 --> 1021.12
but adam is making his rounds i

1022.839 --> 1028.76
see oh hindi right that's the word

1041.919 --> 1044.7990000000002
hey snowbirds

1047.76 --> 1053.32
right

1049.6 --> 1053.32
be back in two minutes

1085.919 --> 1088.919
okay

1114.88 --> 1117.88
so

1177.039 --> 1180.0
and i'm back

1186.64 --> 1189.96
hey clary

1193.679 --> 1196.679
uh

1210.24 --> 1213.24
what

1225.36 --> 1229.84
i don't even understand like what he's

1227.6 --> 1231.12
talking about

1229.84 --> 1234.4399999999998
cvx

1231.12 --> 1234.4399999999998
like what

1239.84 --> 1244.32
are you trying to straw menace again

1241.76 --> 1248.039
with the disc as if it is like a literal

1244.32 --> 1248.039
euclidean thing

1252.48 --> 1257.0
probably that's what they all do

1273.919 --> 1278.24
thinks the diameter is the circumference

1276.88 --> 1282.44
oh really

1278.24 --> 1282.44
i hadn't even picked up on that

1298.24 --> 1302.2
those words are too expensive

1327.52 --> 1331.2
come on service day euclidean is not

1329.919 --> 1333.8400000000001
that hard

1331.2 --> 1333.8400000000001
to spell

1334.88 --> 1338.5200000000002
now

1336.08 --> 1342.24
like try to figure out how to write

1338.52 --> 1344.0
pseudo-ramonian for space now that's

1342.24 --> 1347.039
a chore

1344.0 --> 1350.0
like i just say pseudo four space

1347.039 --> 1352.32
because i don't ramonian is like

1350.0 --> 1355.6
the way you

1352.32 --> 1357.76
you pronounce it is like very different

1355.6 --> 1361.84
from what it actually looks like so i

1357.76 --> 1361.84
always mess that word up

1362.08 --> 1369.76
or have to like look it up every time

1364.96 --> 1370.64
but you cl no no euclidean you could be

1369.76 --> 1372.32
quite

1370.64 --> 1375.76
literally

1372.32 --> 1378.799
it's it would be the same in dutch

1375.76 --> 1378.799
oh kledes

1379.2 --> 1383.52
or

1380.32 --> 1383.52
a clearance

1385.039 --> 1389.28
no that's not how you spell that at all

1387.84 --> 1393.4399999999998
rasta hat

1389.28 --> 1393.44
it's actually a ri monian

1393.52 --> 1397.76
air

1394.48 --> 1400.159
r h i or something i don't know it's j

1397.76 --> 1403.1589999999999
but it's not the way it sounds it's not

1400.159 --> 1403.159
ramonian

1406.24 --> 1408.48
right

1409.039 --> 1414.4
you think logically no you're straw

1410.96 --> 1417.8400000000001
manning in your gas lighting yourself

1414.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
you're not impressing anybody

1418.799 --> 1424.559
it's all a stupid fundy zealot act and

1422.32 --> 1427.039
everybody in this chat except you seems

1424.559 --> 1429.6
to realize that

1427.039 --> 1431.6
so we're not buying your act

1429.6 --> 1432.799
remaining

1431.6 --> 1434.7199999999998
right

1432.799 --> 1436.96
right

1434.72 --> 1440.52
see now that's not how you think you

1436.96 --> 1440.52
would spell that

1446.159 --> 1451.679
euclidean three space is reality

1449.279 --> 1451.679
yes

1451.84 --> 1460.32
or at least that's a coordinate

1454.96 --> 1461.679
layout system that's based on reality

1460.32 --> 1463.36
that's actual

1461.679 --> 1468.039
where everything really is in the

1463.36 --> 1468.039
position it literally supposed to be

1474.64 --> 1478.72
what's my model summary

1479.52 --> 1482.24
that's flat

1482.48 --> 1486.96
and there's still some things to be

1484.799 --> 1488.799
figured out concerning the orientation

1486.96 --> 1490.88
of the land masses and even like what

1488.799 --> 1493.52
are the total

1490.88 --> 1496.159
confine the confines what is the

1493.52 --> 1498.559
available space how is it

1496.159 --> 1501.8400000000001
interconnected there's still more to be

1498.559 --> 1501.84
figured out

1507.76 --> 1511.36
do i believe ballers are purposely lying

1510.32 --> 1513.6789999999999
to me

1511.36 --> 1516.1589999999999
well not like that there are first and

1513.679 --> 1518.48
foremost lying to themselves because of

1516.159 --> 1520.72
their religious dedication

1518.48 --> 1523.76
they don't see it right so it's like

1520.72 --> 1525.76
they lie by accident but they're so

1523.76 --> 1526.72
doubling down on it that they don't pick

1525.76 --> 1528.799
up on

1526.72 --> 1530.88
the hints you get

1528.799 --> 1533.9189999999999
when you make a mistake right so they

1530.88 --> 1535.44
they actually ignore all hints of that

1533.919 --> 1538.7990000000002
they're wrong

1535.44 --> 1540.96
so it's almost lying but technically

1538.799 --> 1542.799
it's just religious zealotry it's

1540.96 --> 1544.32
fooling yourself falls under the

1542.799 --> 1546.72
category of

1544.32 --> 1548.559
belief

1546.72 --> 1551.919
so

1548.559 --> 1554.08
in that sense they're not lying

1551.919 --> 1555.44
in their angle of approach it's just

1554.08 --> 1558.559
that

1555.44 --> 1561.2
what they bring forth as arguments

1558.559 --> 1563.2
it's all [ __ ] it's straw men and

1561.2 --> 1565.6000000000001
that's it's not

1563.2 --> 1567.52
well it's almost lying like if you

1565.6 --> 1569.76
constantly chant that sort of [ __ ]

1567.52 --> 1572.32
people explain to you why it's wrong and

1569.76 --> 1573.12
you just keep chanting the same [ __ ]

1572.32 --> 1574.799
then

1573.12 --> 1576.4799999999998
well if you have proof

1574.799 --> 1580.48
that they've ignored it yeah then it

1576.48 --> 1580.48
becomes lying that's right

1581.6 --> 1585.76
because when you willingly ignore

1584.24 --> 1588.72
information that

1585.76 --> 1590.8799999999999
that blatantly proves

1588.72 --> 1594.0
what you say is wrong

1590.88 --> 1596.24
then you are lying

1594.0 --> 1598.64
effectively

1596.24 --> 1601.2
you might not be

1598.64 --> 1603.279
consciously aware of it in the present

1601.2 --> 1605.76
like a true lie

1603.279 --> 1608.48
but you are

1605.76 --> 1610.72
effectively doing the same thing yeah

1608.48 --> 1615.3600000000001
lying

1610.72 --> 1617.44
but really mostly lying to yourself

1615.36 --> 1619.36
when you lie to yourself well then that

1617.44 --> 1624.1200000000001
lie basically

1619.36 --> 1624.12
reflects on everything what you do

1640.72 --> 1645.919
that requires a person to accept the

1642.72 --> 1645.919
evidence no it doesn't

1649.679 --> 1655.8400000000001
it only requires a person to realize

1652.559 --> 1655.84
that they are wrong

1658.96 --> 1662.64
well i guess that maybe they would have

1661.039 --> 1667.8799999999999
to accept the evidence but if you're

1662.64 --> 1667.88
literally ignoring everything everything

1668.08 --> 1673.4399999999998
then

1669.679 --> 1674.799
maybe that's even worse than lying

1673.44 --> 1678.3990000000001
willing

1674.799 --> 1680.559
systematic ignorance is worse than lying

1678.399 --> 1683.84
in my opinion

1680.559 --> 1683.84
it's true zealotry

1685.52 --> 1690.1589999999999
but that person telling you evolution is

1687.6 --> 1692.24
real is not lying well

1690.159 --> 1694.96
that depends on how far they looked into

1692.24 --> 1696.799
it you know if you just go by what you

1694.96 --> 1698.64
saw in some book

1696.799 --> 1701.2
what your teacher told you when you were

1698.64 --> 1703.2
young yeah

1701.2 --> 1705.76
you don't know a lot about it you don't

1703.2 --> 1708.3990000000001
know everything but if you then don't

1705.76 --> 1711.039
listen to the rest of the information

1708.399 --> 1712.799
and the responses and you still start

1711.039 --> 1716.48
repeating the same thing over and over

1712.799 --> 1718.32
again yeah then you become a liar

1716.48 --> 1719.76
because you should know better you were

1718.32 --> 1725.6399999999999
presented with

1719.76 --> 1725.64
evidence against it and you ignored it

1733.52 --> 1736.799
lying is worse than ignorance

1735.6 --> 1740.0
no

1736.799 --> 1742.72
oh really so the intent

1740.0 --> 1742.72
to ignore

1742.799 --> 1745.44
how about that

1746.72 --> 1753.679
i mean people have little lies but to

1750.159 --> 1756.159
truly ignore even on a social level is a

1753.679 --> 1757.3600000000001
gr egregious offense

1756.159 --> 1759.8400000000001
right

1757.36 --> 1761.52
little lies lots of people do that this

1759.84 --> 1763.039
is the kind of common thing

1761.52 --> 1764.8799999999999
unfortunately

1763.039 --> 1766.64
right it's difficult kind of for a lot

1764.88 --> 1769.8400000000001
of people not to do that they don't

1766.64 --> 1771.44
necessarily mean harm when you willingly

1769.84 --> 1773.12
ignore

1771.44 --> 1775.6000000000001
somebody's plight

1773.12 --> 1777.1999999999998
willingly ignore it

1775.6 --> 1779.76
and just act

1777.2 --> 1781.52
like what they said doesn't exist like

1779.76 --> 1782.64
even in front of their face

1781.52 --> 1785.76
that's

1782.64 --> 1788.3990000000001
more offensive than little eyes

1785.76 --> 1790.72
so i disagree with you

1788.399 --> 1794.279
that's like blatant

1790.72 --> 1794.279
mental disrespect

1818.08 --> 1822.48
what if they truly disagree well then

1820.0 --> 1825.039
they should be able to argue

1822.48 --> 1827.3600000000001
exactly how

1825.039 --> 1829.2
and lay that out and not just

1827.36 --> 1831.279
gaslight everybody like oh it's all

1829.2 --> 1835.159
wrong it's all disproven which is

1831.279 --> 1835.159
complete horse [ __ ]

1836.24 --> 1841.1200000000001
right if you truly disagree well then

1838.799 --> 1843.279
lay it out lay out what you disagree

1841.12 --> 1845.9189999999999
about and then figure out how it's a

1843.279 --> 1848.32
straw man because it is because that's

1845.919 --> 1849.919
what we say immediately the moment you

1848.32 --> 1852.559
say it because we've heard it all

1849.919 --> 1856.3200000000002
thousands of times now in the last few

1852.559 --> 1858.48
years thousands of times ballers trolls

1856.32 --> 1862.799
they all do it they always do it the

1858.48 --> 1865.1200000000001
same way always a straw man always every

1862.799 --> 1868.08
single time a straw man always always

1865.12 --> 1868.08
always always

1871.36 --> 1876.32
people have did no i disagree

1873.84 --> 1879.36
when you willingly ignore somebody's

1876.32 --> 1880.48
argumentation and then strawman them

1879.36 --> 1883.1999999999998
again

1880.48 --> 1884.159
about what where they stand that's

1883.2 --> 1886.48
that's

1884.159 --> 1886.48
worse

1888.08 --> 1892.6399999999999
it's not just a basic disagreement a

1890.08 --> 1894.559
basic disagreement

1892.64 --> 1895.519
right should

1894.559 --> 1898.1589999999999
lead

1895.519 --> 1900.559
to two specific outcomes one being

1898.159 --> 1902.159
saying okay look i don't want to talk

1900.559 --> 1904.1589999999999
about this

1902.159 --> 1906.0
i'm not fully informed but i don't want

1904.159 --> 1909.2
to talk about this because i disagree i

1906.0 --> 1911.679
don't want to go there second being

1909.2 --> 1911.679
okay

1913.519 --> 1919.2
i might not be fully informed well

1916.24 --> 1921.279
i'll just try to figure it out right

1919.2 --> 1923.6000000000001
i'll actually think about the things you

1921.279 --> 1926.159
said and then adapt

1923.6 --> 1928.32
what i thought

1926.159 --> 1930.5590000000002
doesn't have to change your opinion

1928.32 --> 1931.6789999999999
or when you stand but at least you could

1930.559 --> 1934.96
start

1931.679 --> 1937.679
by getting the blatant misconceptions

1934.96 --> 1938.559
about what the other others arguments

1937.679 --> 1940.3200000000002
are

1938.559 --> 1942.48
out of the way

1940.32 --> 1946.48
you see

1942.48 --> 1950.32
that is a normal way to go about

1946.48 --> 1953.2
not repeating the same shitty straw man

1950.32 --> 1955.039
over and over and over again

1953.2 --> 1959.48
for half a decade

1955.039 --> 1959.48
okay that's not normal

1965.76 --> 1970.12
there is no intent yeah there is

1980.96 --> 1983.96
um

1999.039 --> 2002.24
get the [ __ ] out here

2002.559 --> 2009.36
it's time to kick some [ __ ] out

2006.399 --> 2009.36
i'm not doing this

2011.039 --> 2016.48
i'm not wasting my time on you bunch of

2013.76 --> 2016.48
[ __ ]

2016.64 --> 2023.919
go to your little troll rooms and squirt

2020.559 --> 2027.48
all day long and stop whining

2023.919 --> 2027.48
here okay

2034.399 --> 2037.399
uh

2064.0 --> 2067.04
yeah i'm called willfully ignorant all

2065.599 --> 2069.28
the time by glovers yeah that's called

2067.04 --> 2071.359
projection that's another thing they do

2069.28 --> 2074.0
constantly right

2071.359 --> 2076.0789999999997
their entire straw man tactic approach

2074.0 --> 2079.919
which i addressed

2076.079 --> 2079.9190000000003
but oh your flat earth model

2080.159 --> 2085.52
that's also projection the entire

2082.8 --> 2088.5600000000004
foundation of what globers do now is

2085.52 --> 2091.44
based on projection everything that

2088.56 --> 2093.52
they're screwed up in in their model and

2091.44 --> 2096.48
all their assumptions is what they

2093.52 --> 2099.44
literally end up accusing like a mirror

2096.48 --> 2101.359
image the flat earth is on utilizing

2099.44 --> 2103.76
stupid

2101.359 --> 2106.24
like completely out of nowhere straw man

2103.76 --> 2107.2000000000003
models that literally no flat earther

2106.24 --> 2109.7599999999998
ever

2107.2 --> 2112.24
accepts to be real

2109.76 --> 2114.0
or believes in any way

2112.24 --> 2117.2799999999997
that's what they all do so they start

2114.0 --> 2119.119
out projecting every time

2117.28 --> 2122.0
so that's all they got left because they

2119.119 --> 2124.8
lost so egregiously that projection is

2122.0 --> 2128.16
like the only survival mechanism

2124.8 --> 2130.96
to prevent things from sinking in

2128.16 --> 2133.04
they just flip around the entire reality

2130.96 --> 2135.44
they're not the losers no we're the

2133.04 --> 2137.7599999999998
losers everything that we say is all a

2135.44 --> 2137.76
loss

2138.079 --> 2141.079
projection

2144.72 --> 2150.3999999999996
hello mark shy

2147.839 --> 2150.4
shirey

2151.76 --> 2155.8
and david hall by the way

2177.44 --> 2179.68
okay

2180.72 --> 2186.7999999999997
you're talking about globals right

2183.359 --> 2189.359
when globers find out about earth

2186.8 --> 2189.3590000000004
flat earth

2190.96 --> 2193.68
should basically

2192.64 --> 2195.68
yeah

2193.68 --> 2200.2799999999997
set it slightly different

2195.68 --> 2200.2799999999997
it's not just people in general

2208.079 --> 2211.079
what

2217.76 --> 2221.6800000000003
what the hell david hall this is nothing

2219.599 --> 2223.04
to do with the example

2221.68 --> 2225.04
right

2223.04 --> 2227.359
if you would take that example or you

2225.04 --> 2229.52
ignore the chinese language

2227.359 --> 2230.7999999999997
that doesn't make you

2229.52 --> 2234.88
a liar

2230.8 --> 2237.2000000000003
yeah well how about if you actually

2234.88 --> 2238.7200000000003
live in china and then you ignore the

2237.2 --> 2240.16
language how about that because then

2238.72 --> 2243.359
it's going to be everywhere it's going

2240.16 --> 2244.72
to require dedicated ignorance

2243.359 --> 2246.48
you're going to have to constantly

2244.72 --> 2248.3199999999997
ignore it as you're being faced with it

2246.48 --> 2250.4
that's quite a situation different

2248.32 --> 2253.04
situation from

2250.4 --> 2255.04
you just don't get involved right are

2253.04 --> 2256.4
these people that come trolling in my

2255.04 --> 2258.4
chat

2256.4 --> 2260.1600000000003
not getting involved or are they

2258.4 --> 2263.2000000000003
constantly

2260.16 --> 2266.0
getting in flat earthers faces

2263.2 --> 2266.8799999999997
you see that's very different

2266.0 --> 2269.52
from

2266.88 --> 2272.079
not knowing chinese and therefore it's

2269.52 --> 2274.16
supposedly ignorant that's very

2272.079 --> 2276.4
different your example is poor david

2274.16 --> 2276.3999999999996
hall

2276.56 --> 2283.56
no not exactly it's a poor comparison

2280.16 --> 2283.56
very poor

2293.28 --> 2296.28
ah

2309.92 --> 2314.4
you're constantly getting into glover's

2311.599 --> 2317.96
face well that's your prerogative

2314.4 --> 2317.96
i don't do that

2343.68 --> 2349.5989999999997
i sometimes think it's too much as far

2346.0 --> 2352.88
as you think toiling

2349.599 --> 2355.76
yeah that's the whole big giant

2352.88 --> 2358.32
gaping hole type of issue here

2355.76 --> 2359.599
it's the constant polarization

2358.32 --> 2362.8
constant

2359.599 --> 2364.88
it's the main weapon they use to keep

2362.8 --> 2367.119
people out of flat earth

2364.88 --> 2371.44
because who wants to deal

2367.119 --> 2374.0
with this endless stream of scumbaggery

2371.44 --> 2376.16
nagging you and sometimes with some

2374.0 --> 2377.92
people even threatening you yeah who

2376.16 --> 2380.16
want who the hell wants to deal with

2377.92 --> 2380.16
that

2380.839 --> 2385.44
nobody yeah it's because of the

2383.04 --> 2390.079
polarization

2385.44 --> 2393.359
and i've been attempting to depolarize

2390.079 --> 2396.0
the flat earth versus globe situation

2393.359 --> 2398.56
for years now it's one of my missions

2396.0 --> 2403.44
dual cosmogonical society

2398.56 --> 2403.44
where we can just keep it philosophical

2407.599 --> 2413.04
yeah sorry i don't

2409.839 --> 2415.599
i'm not accepting names like that piss

2413.04 --> 2418.8
off troll piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] off with

2415.599 --> 2422.119
your stupid [ __ ] sock account scumbag

2418.8 --> 2422.119
[ __ ] off

2456.4 --> 2461.6800000000003
okay well david hall i never

2458.88 --> 2464.319
did i maybe i did by accident say that a

2461.68 --> 2467.2799999999997
willingly ignorant person is

2464.319 --> 2469.839
a liar

2467.28 --> 2472.3190000000004
it i guess it's technically not entirely

2469.839 --> 2474.88
the same but i think it's worse i think

2472.319 --> 2474.88
it's worse

2475.44 --> 2480.76
it's a non-stop stream of deflections

2484.0 --> 2487.119
it is the opposite

2487.52 --> 2494.16
of a person willing to learn

2490.56 --> 2496.7999999999997
i think it's worse so fine it's not a

2494.16 --> 2498.16
lie okay will you stop whining about it

2496.8 --> 2500.96
now david how

2498.16 --> 2503.7599999999998
it's not a lie i get it it's not a lie

2537.52 --> 2542.44
soccer cons

2617.2 --> 2622.0789999999997
the surface really did you do you know

2619.92 --> 2625.599
the numbers

2622.079 --> 2628.5600000000004
jeff gas head total in do you know the

2625.599 --> 2631.28
actual numbers of the official pressure

2628.56 --> 2634.16
do you know them because now this

2631.28 --> 2637.76
[ __ ] baller is gonna get in the chat

2634.16 --> 2640.16
as he does and now he's gonna whine that

2637.76 --> 2642.8
you don't know what you're talking about

2640.16 --> 2645.7599999999998
because he might be right you're just oh

2642.8 --> 2648.96
it's so funny oh a helicopter parachute

2645.76 --> 2651.76
on mars you don't even know the details

2648.96 --> 2654.8
of the situation you just looking at it

2651.76 --> 2657.2000000000003
heard somebody say this is ridiculous

2654.8 --> 2660.319
this can't work and then you didn't

2657.2 --> 2663.4399999999996
inquire further to actually know the

2660.319 --> 2665.52
details before you roll out the joke so

2663.44 --> 2668.16
that ballers can

2665.52 --> 2670.72
feel smart again for seeing a flat

2668.16 --> 2674.8799999999997
earther in chat say something without

2670.72 --> 2678.3999999999996
actually knowing the details of it yeah

2674.88 --> 2681.28
this is a problem a big problem a

2678.4 --> 2682.079
cultural problem with people in flat

2681.28 --> 2684.88
earth

2682.079 --> 2687.119
blabbering their mouths off

2684.88 --> 2690.1600000000003
thinking they're all smart for having

2687.119 --> 2692.6400000000003
heard some kind of joke and not knowing

2690.16 --> 2695.7599999999998
the technical details about them so that

2692.64 --> 2698.72
the baller gets in wherever they are and

2695.76 --> 2700.4
point at them and say you don't know

2698.72 --> 2701.5989999999997
what you're talking about

2700.4 --> 2704.64
all right

2701.599 --> 2706.4
this needs to stop

2704.64 --> 2709.7599999999998
if you're gonna make a joke about

2706.4 --> 2714.2400000000002
something then you better damn well know

2709.76 --> 2716.0
the details or this [ __ ] will never

2714.24 --> 2719.1189999999997
ever end

2716.0 --> 2722.4
do you understand ever it will never

2719.119 --> 2726.4
stop and they will be justified

2722.4 --> 2730.4
to do what they do unless you get

2726.4 --> 2733.119
informed before you start joking around

2730.4 --> 2735.839
about something

2733.119 --> 2737.839
sorry for getting so pissed off here but

2735.839 --> 2739.52
this is like one of the systematic

2737.839 --> 2741.599
problems i've been talking about this

2739.52 --> 2745.359
morning with my social worker it's

2741.599 --> 2750.079
universal everybody is a blabbermouth

2745.359 --> 2752.72
every body is a blabber mouth you talk

2750.079 --> 2754.4
you're not informed about the subject

2752.72 --> 2757.1189999999997
you talk about

2754.4 --> 2760.1600000000003
but you're feeling all so powerful

2757.119 --> 2762.48
knowing vaguely something not knowing

2760.16 --> 2764.96
the details then you get confronted by

2762.48 --> 2766.64
the opponent and then you look like an

2764.96 --> 2768.0
ass

2766.64 --> 2770.7999999999997
stop it

2768.0 --> 2774.2
be informed before you [ __ ] joke

2770.8 --> 2774.2000000000003
about something

2781.839 --> 2784.0789999999997
see

2786.24 --> 2792.3999999999996
be informed about something before you

2790.0 --> 2794.96
start joking about it

2792.4 --> 2797.52
this is critical

2794.96 --> 2800.0
you're gonna make flat earthers look

2797.52 --> 2802.48
like retards

2800.0 --> 2805.76
if you don't you must

2802.48 --> 2808.64
do this you understand

2805.76 --> 2810.7200000000003
if you don't start doing this and

2808.64 --> 2812.48
getting informed about what the [ __ ]

2810.72 --> 2814.8799999999997
you're talking about

2812.48 --> 2818.64
i'm gonna get really pissed off at you

2814.88 --> 2818.6400000000003
people a lot of you

2821.599 --> 2826.4
and yeah sure globers do it oh yeah

2824.16 --> 2829.44
that's such a great excuse for people

2826.4 --> 2832.1600000000003
that are mentally degenerated

2829.44 --> 2834.48
by their willing ignorance for prolonged

2832.16 --> 2836.72
periods to compare yourself with these

2834.48 --> 2840.319
mental degenerates and then think it's

2836.72 --> 2844.0789999999997
okay no it's not you're a flat earther

2840.319 --> 2846.16
you need to know the facts of what the

2844.079 --> 2848.96
[ __ ] you talk about

2846.16 --> 2848.96
you understand

2853.839 --> 2858.72
it doesn't matter it's just a [ __ ]

2856.4 --> 2860.88
sci-fi story if you're gonna say

2858.72 --> 2863.839
something

2860.88 --> 2866.559
oh helicopters on mars

2863.839 --> 2868.48
parachutes that can't work there is no

2866.559 --> 2870.8
air oh really what's the air pressure

2868.48 --> 2874.0
what is it what's it officially i know

2870.8 --> 2877.04
it doesn't exist what is it though

2874.0 --> 2879.599
officially what is the number there is a

2877.04 --> 2881.2
number do you know it have you actually

2879.599 --> 2884.6400000000003
figured out what it would be like

2881.2 --> 2887.2799999999997
mechanically presupposedly

2884.64 --> 2889.44
with the helicopter do you actually know

2887.28 --> 2891.119
how that works or you just heard oh

2889.44 --> 2893.92
there's no error on mars

2891.119 --> 2895.92
oh it can't work oh oh

2893.92 --> 2898.16
oh because it's not real i can just

2895.92 --> 2900.96
blabber on like i know what the [ __ ] i'm

2898.16 --> 2903.2
talking about no you can't if you're

2900.96 --> 2906.0
gonna make jokes about something then

2903.2 --> 2910.0789999999997
you better damn well be informed about

2906.0 --> 2913.44
it even if you know it's not real you

2910.079 --> 2916.6400000000003
need to know the details there is a

2913.44 --> 2918.64
story it has mechanics if you're gonna

2916.64 --> 2920.319
joke about it you better damn well know

2918.64 --> 2923.839
what it is

2920.319 --> 2923.839
or you're gonna look like an ass

2924.64 --> 2928.5589999999997
we can't no yeah you can you can [ __ ]

2927.28 --> 2930.2400000000002
look it up

2928.559 --> 2931.8390000000004
[ __ ]

2930.24 --> 2934.5589999999997
look it up

2931.839 --> 2937.2
it has a number

2934.559 --> 2938.7200000000003
there is a claim yeah it's not proven i

2937.2 --> 2940.5589999999997
know it's not proven

2938.72 --> 2942.9599999999996
does it matter there is a claim there is

2940.559 --> 2945.76
a number you can revert back to that

2942.96 --> 2947.839
number for your claim

2945.76 --> 2950.079
and then you can joke about it

2947.839 --> 2952.72
you don't just blabber on and think you

2950.079 --> 2954.48
could just blabber on and say anything

2952.72 --> 2956.72
and think you're all smart just because

2954.48 --> 2960.28
you know it's not real no it just makes

2956.72 --> 2960.2799999999997
you look [ __ ]

2970.0 --> 2974.0
right there you go bill nye design

2971.92 --> 2975.6800000000003
schneider thank you see

2974.0 --> 2978.64
see

2975.68 --> 2979.839
that's information does it matter it's

2978.64 --> 2980.8799999999997
not real

2979.839 --> 2984.0789999999997
that's

2980.88 --> 2986.7200000000003
what they're going by you can use that

2984.079 --> 2988.8
data to then compare

2986.72 --> 2990.8799999999997
can this supposed helicopter or

2988.8 --> 2992.96
parachute work with that

2990.88 --> 2995.76
calculate it know

2992.96 --> 2998.8
why it can't work mechanically instead

2995.76 --> 3002.4
of just saying something random and not

2998.8 --> 3002.4
knowing anything about it

3005.68 --> 3009.68
he made a joke i don't give a [ __ ]

3008.0 --> 3011.68
if you're gonna make a joke in the in

3009.68 --> 3015.8799999999997
the presence of ballers you better damn

3011.68 --> 3015.8799999999997
well know what you're joking about

3030.48 --> 3033.839

3032.559 --> 3035.119
me

3033.839 --> 3037.68
well

3035.119 --> 3040.0
yeah well somebody else

3037.68 --> 3042.16
right somebody else actually dug up the

3040.0 --> 3045.119
information why don't you concede that

3042.16 --> 3049.1189999999997
you were too lazy to figure it out

3045.119 --> 3049.119
you just think you can blabber on

3049.2 --> 3052.96
just because you're a flat earther and

3050.88 --> 3055.44
that that you're smart because you know

3052.96 --> 3057.52
it's fake no you're not

3055.44 --> 3058.96
if you're not gonna be informed about

3057.52 --> 3061.04
what you're talking about you're gonna

3058.96 --> 3063.04
look like a [ __ ]

3061.04 --> 3066.8
and you're gonna make flat earthers look

3063.04 --> 3069.2799999999997
stupid that way don't you understand

3066.8 --> 3071.3590000000004
that's the problem i'm having here

3069.28 --> 3073.119
you're gonna look stupid i don't want

3071.359 --> 3075.2799999999997
you to look stupid

3073.119 --> 3077.92
be informed about what the [ __ ] you're

3075.28 --> 3077.92
talking about

3078.319 --> 3085.52
and if you're not then freaking admit it

3083.28 --> 3087.8390000000004
yeah sorry i probably should have looked

3085.52 --> 3090.8
that up before i started blabbering on

3087.839 --> 3091.599
like it's like i'm so smart yeah that's

3090.8 --> 3093.8390000000004
right

3091.599 --> 3096.96
you should do that

3093.839 --> 3099.52
and not ignore it that's what that's

3096.96 --> 3104.44
what ballers do you understand you don't

3099.52 --> 3104.44
want to become them don't become them

3110.24 --> 3116.0789999999997
i know david hall i know he did that

3113.359 --> 3117.2799999999997
jeff gassett because jeff gassett gets

3116.079 --> 3120.4
it

3117.28 --> 3122.48
he's a crusher he actually knows what's

3120.4 --> 3125.839
going on here

3122.48 --> 3125.839
and the social issues

3126.64 --> 3132.319
i'm not apologizing to get jeff gassette

3129.44 --> 3133.2000000000003
i wasn't addressing jeff gas head david

3132.319 --> 3137.24
hall

3133.2 --> 3137.24
are you giving me lip again

3140.8 --> 3144.0
did he make the joke

3150.4 --> 3155.359
yeah he did and then he said much later

3153.44 --> 3159.28
much much later

3155.359 --> 3159.2799999999997
3 2 23

3163.92 --> 3169.04
27 4 minute okay all right all right

3167.52 --> 3170.559
okay

3169.04 --> 3172.4
right well it was a

3170.559 --> 3174.4
universal

3172.4 --> 3177.119
it was universe it's not just

3174.4 --> 3178.64
jeff gas had here i'm glad he actually

3177.119 --> 3181.839
did that

3178.64 --> 3181.839
but it is universal

3182.8 --> 3188.4
when you're around ballers you can't

3185.359 --> 3190.7999999999997
just joke around about their

3188.4 --> 3193.839
cosmology medium

3190.8 --> 3196.6400000000003
and not know the details because you're

3193.839 --> 3199.92
just gonna look stupid

3196.64 --> 3202.16
you mustn't do that it's universal

3199.92 --> 3204.2400000000002
i'm not just going after jeff gassett

3202.16 --> 3205.5989999999997
he's he's awesome

3204.24 --> 3207.839
even though he did start making that

3205.599 --> 3211.599
joke but he well four minutes later at

3207.839 --> 3211.599
least inserted the data

3211.92 --> 3215.2000000000003
yeah i can imagine with like three

3213.92 --> 3216.64
percent

3215.2 --> 3220.64
earth-based pressure you're going to

3216.64 --> 3222.48
have very little resistance on

3220.64 --> 3224.16
with a helicopter for example and with a

3222.48 --> 3225.28
parachute we probably wouldn't even do

3224.16 --> 3228.72
anything

3225.28 --> 3228.7200000000003
just go straight down bang

3229.04 --> 3234.72
right because now we have that data we

3231.52 --> 3234.72
have that plugged

3235.76 --> 3242.4
and now the ballers can't stop yeah they

3238.24 --> 3244.16
don't have any rebuttal to it see

3242.4 --> 3246.4
if you hadn't done that they would just

3244.16 --> 3247.92
be whining on about how you don't know

3246.4 --> 3250.4
what you're talking about and guess what

3247.92 --> 3252.88
everybody that would be looking

3250.4 --> 3255.2000000000003
and wasn't informed about any of this

3252.88 --> 3258.6800000000003
they would agree with them

3255.2 --> 3258.68
do you see

3264.88 --> 3269.52
right yeah but look that ballers don't

3267.52 --> 3271.28
know [ __ ] and that they accuse you of

3269.52 --> 3272.24
not knowing [ __ ] has nothing to do with

3271.28 --> 3274.88
it

3272.24 --> 3276.8799999999997
it has to do with that you should be

3274.88 --> 3278.6400000000003
informed what you're talking about

3276.88 --> 3283.52
that's what it has to do with not with

3278.64 --> 3283.52
what they say you're doing right

3288.559 --> 3293.1600000000003
hey by the way hello skeptic 936

3296.64 --> 3300.72
if fears claimed mars is in play a

3298.96 --> 3304.48
second law of thermodynamics violation

3300.72 --> 3304.48
yeah no that's not a bad claim at all

3304.559 --> 3308.48
of course i know

3306.4 --> 3311.2000000000003
right it can't exist second law of

3308.48 --> 3313.92
thermodynamics the the whole situation

3311.2 --> 3315.9199999999996
out there is completely fubar

3313.92 --> 3318.7200000000003
but that wasn't really the remark the

3315.92 --> 3322.64
remark was

3318.72 --> 3322.64
helicopters and parachutes on mars

3326.079 --> 3331.599
and why that wouldn't work

3328.799 --> 3333.52
that was the issue

3331.599 --> 3335.839
again it doesn't matter if you're gonna

3333.52 --> 3337.04
say yeah but it's all fake that doesn't

3335.839 --> 3339.52
matter

3337.04 --> 3343.119
if you're gonna say this doesn't work

3339.52 --> 3345.04
within some presupposed setting

3343.119 --> 3348.079
don't bring it up unless you actually

3345.04 --> 3350.16
know mechanically why it doesn't work

3348.079 --> 3352.48
and that yeah you could of course

3350.16 --> 3354.16
afterward always drag in the second law

3352.48 --> 3356.96
of thermodynamics violation yeah but

3354.16 --> 3358.799
that's not specifically the reason why

3356.96 --> 3360.799
presupposedly the parachute in the

3358.799 --> 3363.839
helicopter wouldn't work on mars now is

3360.799 --> 3363.839
it see

3383.52 --> 3388.079
yeah thank you thank you very much

3385.28 --> 3390.559
service day yeah i

3388.079 --> 3392.799
well i was just very serious

3390.559 --> 3395.52
because it is a systemic problem a

3392.799 --> 3399.119
systemic problem that means

3395.52 --> 3401.68
thousands and thousands of people

3399.119 --> 3403.6800000000003
this is getting worse it's getting worse

3401.68 --> 3405.2
more people are now doing that flat

3403.68 --> 3407.04
earthers we're supposed to be the

3405.2 --> 3409.1189999999997
informed ones here

3407.04 --> 3412.24
and you're doing this by habit it's a

3409.119 --> 3414.079
bad bad move

3412.24 --> 3416.4799999999996
and you don't even realize it because

3414.079 --> 3418.1600000000003
everybody's doing it and then yeah if

3416.48 --> 3419.599
everyone's doing it to just do it too

3418.16 --> 3422.5589999999997
you know no

3419.599 --> 3425.28
no don't do it it's terrible it'll

3422.559 --> 3428.7200000000003
degenerate like the quality of input you

3425.28 --> 3432.119
have it'll make you look like an idiot

3428.72 --> 3432.1189999999997
be informed

3437.839 --> 3442.4
not lifting yeah you are lifting me up

3439.599 --> 3443.599
and that's thank you service day

3442.4 --> 3446.1600000000003
wow

3443.599 --> 3448.7200000000003
i think that was actually sitting on me

3446.16 --> 3451.52
because my stress is now kind of

3448.72 --> 3454.48
diminished a lot

3451.52 --> 3457.119
because this [ __ ] is like wearing on me

3454.48 --> 3461.2
it's been wearing on me for weeks it's

3457.119 --> 3463.52
just people respond like degenerates

3461.2 --> 3466.5589999999997
people that should know better

3463.52 --> 3469.2
and they feel weakened

3466.559 --> 3470.4
but they're not fighting it

3469.2 --> 3473.4399999999996
you're just

3470.4 --> 3475.6800000000003
swimming along you should

3473.44 --> 3478.64
prevent that from happening you should

3475.68 --> 3482.24
be disciplined about what you do

3478.64 --> 3486.839
it's critical for survival

3482.24 --> 3486.839
survival of your mind alone

3490.24 --> 3494.7599999999998
collateral mental health right

3502.079 --> 3508.0
all right mark shirley

3504.4 --> 3508.0
well i do my best to inform

3508.319 --> 3512.319
i mean i'm not always the guy with all

3510.16 --> 3514.0789999999997
the technical detail presentations and

3512.319 --> 3516.72
all that

3514.079 --> 3519.04
but i do try to bring up very relevant

3516.72 --> 3520.72
points especially concerning psychology

3519.04 --> 3523.2
and there's not so many flat earthers

3520.72 --> 3525.359
that really get into that

3523.2 --> 3528.16
i do

3525.359 --> 3530.4
social communication issues psychology

3528.16 --> 3534.24
because that's just as important as the

3530.4 --> 3536.2400000000002
mechanical details of the cosmogeny

3534.24 --> 3538.4799999999996
because that's what we're facing

3536.24 --> 3540.799
psychological warfare that's like the

3538.48 --> 3543.359
main opponent

3540.799 --> 3546.079
the main obstacle is psychological

3543.359 --> 3548.5589999999997
warfare universal it always was and it's

3546.079 --> 3550.319
getting worse it's getting more strong

3548.559 --> 3552.4
more dedicated

3550.319 --> 3554.88
more tenacious

3552.4 --> 3558.799
more systematic more robotic

3554.88 --> 3562.559
and we need to deal with it

3558.799 --> 3562.559
is your social worker in fear

3565.359 --> 3570.72
he knows about it

3566.96 --> 3572.7200000000003
he's just not really interested

3570.72 --> 3575.5989999999997
so he's kind of like a

3572.72 --> 3578.8799999999997
guy that it's like he's fine either way

3575.599 --> 3580.88
right he's like that he's just not

3578.88 --> 3583.92
he's much more interested in social

3580.88 --> 3586.079
matters and psychology

3583.92 --> 3588.559
he's just not really interested in like

3586.079 --> 3591.44
earth being a ball or flat but he does

3588.559 --> 3593.0400000000004
very much know about propaganda and lies

3591.44 --> 3593.839
out there in the world

3593.04 --> 3594.799
right

3593.839 --> 3597.119
so

3594.799 --> 3598.48
that's why he probably is like yeah it

3597.119 --> 3602.48
could be true

3598.48 --> 3602.48
but i'm not really interested

3603.52 --> 3608.68
but he does respect it

3605.28 --> 3608.6800000000003
and that's good

3615.76 --> 3620.7200000000003
because i'm by the way not the only one

3618.96 --> 3622.319
i'm not the only flat earther here it's

3620.72 --> 3626.799
just that most people keep it really

3622.319 --> 3629.2
private for blatantly obvious reasons

3626.799 --> 3631.92
they don't want to get hassled

3629.2 --> 3633.839
or kicked off their platforms

3631.92 --> 3635.839
their general more standard

3633.839 --> 3637.7599999999998
communication platforms and all that and

3635.839 --> 3641.64
get into fights with people over it so

3637.76 --> 3641.6400000000003
they kind of keep it to themselves

3642.16 --> 3645.68
and there's like

3643.68 --> 3648.72
probably other people that kind of

3645.68 --> 3650.0
becomes slightly societally outcasts and

3648.72 --> 3652.0789999999997
yeah

3650.0 --> 3652.88
and well social workers get to face them

3652.079 --> 3654.2400000000002
too

3652.88 --> 3655.6800000000003
right

3654.24 --> 3658.24
if you're not doing all that well in

3655.68 --> 3660.72
society because you're being scuffed

3658.24 --> 3662.799
and ejected

3660.72 --> 3665.5989999999997
for being a flat earther or

3662.799 --> 3667.599
the flat earther being part of like a

3665.599 --> 3669.599
set of problems like attitude problems

3667.599 --> 3672.079
or whatever because that does happen

3669.599 --> 3674.079
yeah then social workers are gonna

3672.079 --> 3675.44
be facing these people and it's only

3674.079 --> 3677.52
logical that

3675.44 --> 3680.799
most of them should know that there's

3677.52 --> 3680.799
such a thing as flat earth

3681.119 --> 3684.6800000000003
out here anyway

3689.119 --> 3694.1600000000003
why do i need a social worker

3691.92 --> 3697.7200000000003
well

3694.16 --> 3697.72
it's very helpful

3698.079 --> 3704.0
it's somebody i can talk to

3700.72 --> 3707.9199999999996
on a more personal level

3704.0 --> 3707.92
and share my inner worries with

3708.079 --> 3713.8390000000004
right and also i i use him for like uh

3714.48 --> 3717.76
well

3715.52 --> 3720.48
at advice

3717.76 --> 3722.6400000000003
it's very informed and sometimes helps

3720.48 --> 3724.88
with like just uh

3722.64 --> 3727.839
paperwork and all that if there's

3724.88 --> 3727.839
something like that

3728.24 --> 3733.9199999999996
so yeah that's why i have that social

3731.039 --> 3736.6400000000003
worker it's like part of the

3733.92 --> 3739.28
of well the social welfare

3736.64 --> 3743.359
system i can just get that

3739.28 --> 3743.3590000000004
and i do i don't overuse it

3744.0 --> 3746.72
but

3744.72 --> 3749.1189999999997
it's been very helpful

3746.72 --> 3751.839
especially concerning financial issues

3749.119 --> 3755.839
when i when i get like like all

3751.839 --> 3755.839
the headaches over papers and all that

3761.28 --> 3768.76
social worker is a link to the real

3763.599 --> 3768.76
world yeah well it is in a way

3770.72 --> 3775.68
but in a way i also kind of kind of use

3773.359 --> 3778.0
him like a colleague

3775.68 --> 3780.3999999999996
because yeah i know psychology you know

3778.0 --> 3782.4
psychology we kind of have the same

3780.4 --> 3784.0
objectives towards the world

3782.4 --> 3785.6800000000003
and so

3784.0 --> 3787.599
yeah he helps me that's like his

3785.68 --> 3789.68
official job but at the same time we

3787.599 --> 3794.599
also kind of feel like colleagues in

3789.68 --> 3794.5989999999997
like a more spiritual mission so

3797.359 --> 3801.839
in the uk only people only get social

3800.0 --> 3805.44
workers if they have problems why i do

3801.839 --> 3805.44
have problems sometimes

3805.599 --> 3811.839
like it used to be a lot worse like

3808.48 --> 3811.839
six seven years ago

3812.0 --> 3816.24
then i really needed it

3814.079 --> 3818.4
now it's just kind of a checkup thing

3816.24 --> 3820.72
it's like we talk

3818.4 --> 3823.359
like every few months i haven't like

3820.72 --> 3825.839
talked in to my social worker in like

3823.359 --> 3825.839
months

3826.16 --> 3830.72
because i've been doing pretty well

3828.48 --> 3831.68
up until

3830.72 --> 3833.68
well

3831.68 --> 3835.2799999999997
a few days ago

3833.68 --> 3837.68
and then i kind of crashed till i called

3835.28 --> 3839.28
him again

3837.68 --> 3841.359
because i thought like i hope my entire

3839.28 --> 3843.52
situation is falling apart and then kind

3841.359 --> 3845.5989999999997
of the yeah the

3843.52 --> 3847.2
the fund run

3845.599 --> 3850.6400000000003
knight l6

3847.2 --> 3852.64
really worked out great so that original

3850.64 --> 3854.5589999999997
premise for contacting him kind of

3852.64 --> 3857.5989999999997
dropped

3854.559 --> 3859.3590000000004
so i just kind of like yeah just

3857.599 --> 3860.559
did update talk

3859.359 --> 3862.24
and

3860.559 --> 3864.799
shared our thoughts about the current

3862.24 --> 3866.5589999999997
situation in the world he was very

3864.799 --> 3869.0389999999998
convinced

3866.559 --> 3871.52
that a lot of the craziness that's going

3869.039 --> 3873.6800000000003
on is going to end very soon he seemed

3871.52 --> 3876.72
very insistent

3873.68 --> 3878.8799999999997
he didn't i didn't elaborate more or i

3876.72 --> 3881.359
didn't inquire as to

3878.88 --> 3883.359
why exactly but he seemed like very

3881.359 --> 3884.64
assured so there might be something

3883.359 --> 3888.4
going to happen

3884.64 --> 3888.4
in the netherlands soon i don't know

3889.119 --> 3895.319
he was very convinced about it

3891.599 --> 3895.319
unusually so

3898.079 --> 3908.599
when i refer to a creator a creator what

3903.52 --> 3908.599
the creator the designer you mean

3909.839 --> 3914.16
the alpha the omega

3912.079 --> 3917.52
the one that originally

3914.16 --> 3919.2799999999997
manifested the realm the way it is and

3917.52 --> 3922.559
that is at the head

3919.28 --> 3924.48
of all information

3922.559 --> 3927.52
all information

3924.48 --> 3931.48
the original seed

3927.52 --> 3931.48
that's who i refer to

3936.4 --> 3943.119
yeah steamy traveler yeah that's a good

3938.319 --> 3943.119
point i in the past i have actually

3944.0 --> 3949.119
considered going like for an official

3946.48 --> 3951.359
psychology job but

3949.119 --> 3953.92
i don't think i can do it

3951.359 --> 3955.0389999999998
you see i am too sensitive

3953.92 --> 3956.64
and if you're going to deal with

3955.039 --> 3958.4
psychology work you're going to have

3956.64 --> 3960.72
people that are like

3958.4 --> 3962.4
having very serious uh issues and

3960.72 --> 3964.8799999999997
especially like

3962.4 --> 3967.52
emotions i would be

3964.88 --> 3968.48
i'm too sensitive for that like a lot of

3967.52 --> 3972.16
like

3968.48 --> 3972.16
psychologists that really do

3972.319 --> 3976.96
the official psychology they get to face

3974.64 --> 3978.96
people that are kind of have serious

3976.96 --> 3981.68
mental and emotional issues and they

3978.96 --> 3983.92
have to be like hard like rock

3981.68 --> 3985.839
i'm not like that

3983.92 --> 3988.799
i i can't do that

3985.839 --> 3991.2
it would literally make me sick i can't

3988.799 --> 3991.2
do that

3991.599 --> 3997.2000000000003
i can occasionally help somebody out

3994.48 --> 3999.119
but not like as a standard

3997.2 --> 4001.359
protocol

3999.119 --> 4003.92
i don't think i can do that like i've

4001.359 --> 4005.68
even talked about it and my social

4003.92 --> 4008.319
worker agrees like yeah you're not the

4005.68 --> 4008.319
type for that

4013.359 --> 4019.7599999999998
but i can apply my psychology skills to

4016.48 --> 4020.4
well my classes which is what this show

4019.76 --> 4023.6800000000003
is

4020.4 --> 4026.4
in part it's like a class

4023.68 --> 4028.799
i'm a teacher and psychology is part of

4026.4 --> 4030.559
my teaching

4028.799 --> 4034.28
that i can do

4030.559 --> 4034.28
with ups and downs

4037.359 --> 4042.2
your ex is a social worker okay

4059.119 --> 4068.4
a specific what no the designer

4064.64 --> 4070.4
to assign a deity is to

4068.4 --> 4074.76
lessen

4070.4 --> 4074.76
the seed of all things

4076.64 --> 4082.96
why would you like start to personify it

4079.92 --> 4085.76
by assigning a deity

4082.96 --> 4089.16
i think jesus actually recommended

4085.76 --> 4089.1600000000003
against that

4103.679 --> 4107.679
right yeah by the way surface day are

4105.759 --> 4109.839
you still planning to come by or is it

4107.679 --> 4111.92
not working out

4109.839 --> 4113.199
i mean again there is no particular

4111.92 --> 4117.359
hurry

4113.199 --> 4118.879999999999
i'm my situation is pretty good now

4117.359 --> 4122.1990000000005
but yeah

4118.88 --> 4122.1990000000005

4133.52 --> 4136.56
i mean i am kind of a bit stressed today

4135.679 --> 4138.08
so

4136.56 --> 4142.4800000000005

4138.08 --> 4142.48

4143.04 --> 4146.2789999999995

4146.4 --> 4149.5199999999995
you don't have to be like sad facey

4148.56 --> 4152.400000000001
about it

4149.52 --> 4154.080000000001
like i i kind of was like maybe we could

4152.4 --> 4156.0
like postpone it because i'm kind of

4154.08 --> 4160.359
like i need

4156.0 --> 4160.359
i need a bit of space right now

4163.6 --> 4167.6

4166.0 --> 4168.799
all right

4167.6 --> 4170.4800000000005
whenever

4168.799 --> 4171.44
whenever the time is right don't worry

4170.48 --> 4174.839
about it

4171.44 --> 4174.839
i'm okay

4180.64 --> 4184.719
