[Music]

282.88 --> 289.84
i got another

286.24 --> 290.72
a bottle of juice diluted down with

289.84 --> 294.15999999999997
water

290.72 --> 294.16
in a cooler really nice

294.32 --> 300.8
and i got a special

297.44 --> 304.24
bonus some orange juice that i put

300.8 --> 305.759
in the cooling thingy yeah i haven't had

304.24 --> 308.88
that for a while i don't drink a lot of

305.759 --> 308.88
orange juice anymore

308.96 --> 312.63899999999995
because i heard it's it's more healthy

311.199 --> 317.28000000000003
to

312.639 --> 320.40000000000003
yeah to take other types of uh

317.28 --> 323.59999999999997
is it citrus fruit instead it's like

320.4 --> 326.71999999999997
lemon like red orange and like

323.6 --> 327.759
grapefruit even though i really do like

326.72 --> 332.32000000000005
the taste of good

327.759 --> 335.68
organic orange juice but yeah

332.32 --> 335.68
i just felt like it today

336.96 --> 343.75899999999996
um oh yeah and of course

340.32 --> 346.56
i have a bonus apple i think it's still

343.759 --> 346.56
from yesterday

349.44 --> 354.8
right hot in the uk as well yeah it's

352.16 --> 358.88000000000005
it's very hot over here

354.8 --> 361.199
it started out like 23 degrees which was

358.88 --> 361.199
nice

361.44 --> 367.84
but i think it's a lot warmer now

368.88 --> 383.039
yeah it's 32 degrees right now

380.8 --> 385.28000000000003
right yeah it looks like it's going to

383.039 --> 387.68
be as hot again tomorrow

385.28 --> 389.59999999999997
with like a minimum temperature of 21

387.68 --> 392.96
degrees

389.6 --> 395.84000000000003
in the deep night sheesh

392.96 --> 395.84
yeah oh well

396.479 --> 400.479
yeah i still have to do my newspaper

398.16 --> 400.88000000000005
round not looking too much forward to

400.479 --> 403.84
that

400.88 --> 405.26
because it's just gonna be extremely hot

403.84 --> 406.71999999999997
i'm afraid

405.26 --> 409.12
[Music]

406.72 --> 411.28000000000003
ah yeah retrospective might have been

409.12 --> 413.12
good to do that in the morning

411.28 --> 415.11999999999995
when it was still cool but i didn't yeah

413.12 --> 416.16
i thought that that coolness is gonna

415.12 --> 419.84000000000003
last it didn't

416.16 --> 419.84000000000003
so yeah tough luck

421.44 --> 429.039
uh any news about fed uh yeah

425.68 --> 429.44
yeah nathan has well yeah i basically

429.039 --> 432.8
said

429.44 --> 434.16
please help him go fund situational

432.8 --> 437.199
computers well he has

434.16 --> 440.8
the funds yeah he has more than double

437.199 --> 443.28000000000003
what he needed so it worked

440.8 --> 444.88
it's just a matter of time now because

443.28 --> 447.19899999999996
his fridge is already

444.88 --> 448.8
repaired and functioning since the

447.199 --> 451.68
weekend

448.8 --> 452.96000000000004
but his computer is in like the workshop

451.68 --> 456.0
and they're fixing it

452.96 --> 459.52
it's taking a little bit more time

456.0 --> 461.599
something like that but it is underway

459.52 --> 463.599
so it's only a matter of time

461.599 --> 464.8
although yeah from what i heard is

463.599 --> 467.52
probably not

464.8 --> 468.479
doing any flat earth debates this week

467.52 --> 471.599
and i'm just gonna

468.479 --> 472.71999999999997
try and uh yeah take over a bit do

471.599 --> 475.759
double shifts

472.72 --> 476.96000000000004
as i'm calling it uh he did come on by

475.759 --> 480.0
the way

476.96 --> 480.479
on the ball busters or the yeah the kiwi

480.0 --> 484.479
life

480.479 --> 488.31899999999996
yesterday he reported on that too

484.479 --> 488.31899999999996
so if any of you caught that show

488.8 --> 493.84000000000003
yeah he was on it i was on it it was a

490.639 --> 493.84000000000003
good show

497.12 --> 502.4
right and oh yeah yesterday also there

499.599 --> 507.84
again was some own benjamin live again

502.4 --> 507.84
it was really good to have him back

510.24 --> 521.839
a lot of funny [ __ ] with ben shapiro and

512.959 --> 521.8389999999999
all that

532.839 --> 535.839
uh

539.12 --> 541.36
hmm

542.16 --> 546.3199999999999
ah getting sick yeah juicing your own is

544.399 --> 549.519
even better

546.32 --> 552.5600000000001
i used to have a pretty good juicer

549.519 --> 556.24
together with my ex but yeah

552.56 --> 556.56
i don't have it anymore and those things

556.24 --> 559.279
do

556.56 --> 560.2399999999999
tend to like even the better ones like

559.279 --> 562.399
over time they

560.24 --> 563.6
think parts about them break it's kind

562.399 --> 566.08
of annoying

563.6 --> 569.36
i guess unless you take like a super

566.08 --> 569.36
super expensive one

569.92 --> 576.16
but yeah it was good to have one of

574.839 --> 578.48
those

576.16 --> 581.8389999999999
like having a juicer does make it much

578.48 --> 585.2
more viable to just have

581.839 --> 588.5600000000001
vegetables whole and fruits whole

585.2 --> 591.6
lying around you know

588.56 --> 593.1999999999999
because it's relatively easy to just

591.6 --> 596.8000000000001
dump it all in there and just make

593.2 --> 596.8000000000001
something out of it pretty quickly

600.48 --> 604.32
like really fresh beet juice is just

603.04 --> 608.64
amazing

604.32 --> 611.6
like grab the beet out of your garden

608.64 --> 613.4399999999999
wash it off take the leaves off cut it

611.6 --> 616.64
in pieces and just dump it

613.44 --> 618.8800000000001
in the juicer and get it like fresh

616.64 --> 622.0
out of the ground now that's like really

618.88 --> 622.0
that makes an impact

623.2 --> 635.44
good times been over five years

632.32 --> 638.5600000000001
beetroot is the devil's piss

635.44 --> 640.0790000000001
right yeah that too well

638.56 --> 642.3199999999999
don't really care because it's just

640.079 --> 644.7199999999999
really good it's really good for the

642.32 --> 644.72
body

645.12 --> 649.44
and i take a well it's not super fresh

647.519 --> 651.68
it's not juiced

649.44 --> 652.48
it's from a bottle but i take organic

651.68 --> 654.88
beet juice

652.48 --> 657.519
usually like half a cup every day in the

654.88 --> 661.519
morning together with my supplements

657.519 --> 664.48
yeah it works out great it it actually

661.519 --> 665.519
helps a lot when i take it compared to

664.48 --> 667.279
when i don't take it

665.519 --> 669.36
it's kind of funny because sometimes i

667.279 --> 671.76
forget and then

669.36 --> 672.72
i notice like oh damn i forget it i'm

671.76 --> 676.48
feeling a bit

672.72 --> 679.0400000000001
yeah iffy then i take it and yeah

676.48 --> 680.16
it's immediately restored so i i kind of

679.04 --> 682.67
do need it

680.16 --> 684.079
i have the uh feeling anyway

682.67 --> 687.5999999999999
[Music]

684.079 --> 690.959
uh yeah ginger can also work

687.6 --> 690.9590000000001
but yeah it's different

696.8 --> 700.4799999999999
yeah but both can be typically used to

699.519 --> 704.32
combine with

700.48 --> 704.32
other herbs and

704.399 --> 708.56
things and then they will enhance it

715.2 --> 719.12
like ginger and tumeric work very good

718.16 --> 722.399
together

719.12 --> 723.519
this is like neighboring they're almost

722.399 --> 725.92
family

723.519 --> 725.92
anyway

727.12 --> 731.44
fermented yeah there's fermented beet

729.6 --> 732.48
juice i don't know if i like that though

731.44 --> 734.8800000000001
but i hear it's very

732.48 --> 734.88
healthy

736.079 --> 740.88
i haven't really tried it yet i really

737.76 --> 743.92
do like just the regular fresh ones

740.88 --> 746.639
but they have fermented versions for

743.92 --> 746.639
sale as well

750.639 --> 754.24
anyway oh i got a foot bath forgot

753.6 --> 759.839
yesterday

754.24 --> 759.839
not forgotten today

770.839 --> 773.839
boy

777.92 --> 781.36
all right i did have a spoon of honey

779.6 --> 784.0790000000001
yesterday i tried that

781.36 --> 787.839
before going to bed and i think i did

784.079 --> 787.8389999999999
dream a lot

788.959 --> 792.079
but i think i forgot about it after the

791.279 --> 795.4399999999999
morning because

792.079 --> 797.8389999999999
yeah usually i i wake up

795.44 --> 799.519
relatively early and then yeah if it's

797.839 --> 800.0
really hot it then it's just like

799.519 --> 801.519
annoying

800.0 --> 803.04
and try to get a little bit more sleep

801.519 --> 804.32
but this time in the morning it was kind

803.04 --> 808.7199999999999
of nice and fresh

804.32 --> 808.72
so i just had a really good second sleep

809.36 --> 813.44
so i feel pretty rested but yeah still

812.72 --> 829.0400000000001
you know the

813.44 --> 831.44
the heat is still kind of pressing

829.04 --> 833.199
yeah gideon yeah beetus yeah if it's

831.44 --> 835.36
just raw and fresh yeah it's pretty

833.199 --> 838.959
impactful you gotta

835.36 --> 841.04
either dilute it with something else

838.959 --> 842.16
or just don't take too much at the same

841.04 --> 845.5999999999999
time

842.16 --> 847.36
like even if i take a like a a glass

845.6 --> 849.1990000000001
because i take like half a glass of

847.36 --> 850.88
these with beet juice

849.199 --> 855.279
that's perfect like if i take a full

850.88 --> 855.279
glass it's already kind of like

855.36 --> 858.9590000000001
and that's not even the really raw

857.519 --> 862.32
juiced one so

858.959 --> 864.4799999999999
yeah beet juice is pretty intense

862.32 --> 865.6
you gotta be careful with that and yeah

864.48 --> 868.88
if you throw it up

865.6 --> 871.6800000000001
that's gonna be extremely messy because

868.88 --> 875.519
those red stains man

871.68 --> 875.519
that's just they're terrible

883.04 --> 886.88
right yeah agm but for example if you

885.44 --> 891.1990000000001
dilute it with

886.88 --> 891.199
carrot juice and

891.76 --> 895.4399999999999
i don't know apple juice i think that

893.6 --> 896.0790000000001
would make a good combination i used to

895.44 --> 897.9200000000001
do that

896.079 --> 900.0
like i made something like that for my

897.92 --> 900.56
ex who really liked juicing in the

900.0 --> 902.16
morning

900.56 --> 904.0
didn't like doing it though but i like

902.16 --> 907.199
doing it for her

904.0 --> 910.72
and yeah i typically did that we i use

907.199 --> 916.079
celery carrots

910.72 --> 916.0790000000001
sometimes radishes red beets

917.12 --> 923.04
and apple like those

920.8 --> 927.8389999999999
five worked great and they combine

923.04 --> 927.8389999999999
really good

930.56 --> 941.8389999999999
although i didn't always put the red

932.24 --> 941.839
bead in there

943.68 --> 948.399
right getting sick yeah you could do

945.68 --> 948.399
lemon in there

948.88 --> 953.4399999999999
but i i kind of like the the earthy

952.32 --> 956.399
taste

953.44 --> 958.0790000000001
of typically the combination of that you

956.399 --> 960.48
know all these vegetables are very

958.079 --> 962.88
earthy in their taste

960.48 --> 963.519
and then it stays like this earthly

962.88 --> 965.04
drink

963.519 --> 967.36
and i like that taste you know if you

965.04 --> 972.48
pour lemon in there then it

967.36 --> 972.48
it kind of ruins that i think

972.72 --> 979.12
but i did have to eat serum anyway yeah

975.839 --> 981.6
drinks in this weather you gotta have it

979.12 --> 996.16
people are gonna have it on their mind

981.6 --> 998.16
and so do i

996.16 --> 1000.56
yeah yeah getting sick yeah not too many

998.16 --> 1000.56
apples

1008.839 --> 1011.839
indeed

1019.519 --> 1024.24
right and then some people would

1021.279 --> 1026.799
probably put things like what's it

1024.24 --> 1026.799
called again

1032.4 --> 1035.919
ah i forgot the name

1036.079 --> 1039.52
but it's this supposed very very healthy

1039.199 --> 1043.52
vet

1039.52 --> 1048.079
or sort of root like no it's not a root

1043.52 --> 1048.079
vegetable hold on

1048.48 --> 1053.84
got the dutch name in my head now

1054.799 --> 1057.2
fennel

1059.76 --> 1064.96
i think it's fennel yeah

1063.12 --> 1066.7199999999998
right that stuff well that's supposed to

1064.96 --> 1070.16
be extremely healthy

1066.72 --> 1073.3600000000001
and it really is it's just that i really

1070.16 --> 1076.559
really don't like it and the taste it

1073.36 --> 1080.03
kind of has this anise

1076.559 --> 1083.1399999999999
like uh

1080.03 --> 1083.1399999999999
[Music]

1083.36 --> 1087.36
any seed yeah that it has a bit of that

1086.48 --> 1090.4
type of taste

1087.36 --> 1094.24
but it's extremely dominant and

1090.4 --> 1095.039
it i don't like it like and it always

1094.24 --> 1097.44
dominates

1095.039 --> 1099.44
so yeah some people would typically do

1097.44 --> 1102.48
that type of stuff

1099.44 --> 1103.52
they would put fennel in there in their

1102.48 --> 1109.84
juicing

1103.52 --> 1109.84
but then that kind of ruins it for me

1110.24 --> 1113.679
like every time i eat fennel it's really

1112.559 --> 1115.36
like oh [ __ ]

1113.679 --> 1117.8400000000001
i have to eat fennel because it's

1115.36 --> 1119.6
healthy because if i didn't have that

1117.84 --> 1120.32
objective in my mind i would just never

1119.6 --> 1122.48
eat it because

1120.32 --> 1123.76
yeah doesn't matter where it's in it's

1122.48 --> 1137.84
always disgusting

1123.76 --> 1137.84
for me

1145.52 --> 1151.039
yes cucumber but

1148.64 --> 1151.8400000000001
not everybody likes cucumber it's weird

1151.039 --> 1155.12
some people

1151.84 --> 1157.28
really dislike it like they have some

1155.12 --> 1158.32
they get something strange out of the

1157.28 --> 1161.12
taste that they just

1158.32 --> 1161.12
really don't like

1161.76 --> 1166.799
i don't notice that i like i like

1164.72 --> 1168.96
cucumber juice basically

1166.799 --> 1171.039
i wouldn't mind although i don't always

1168.96 --> 1179.8400000000001
have a taste for it

1171.039 --> 1179.84
i don't eat too much cucumber

1180.24 --> 1186.48
huh little cup of fennel

1184.559 --> 1188.72
yeah i guess you can make tea of it as

1186.48 --> 1188.72
well

1190.84 --> 1193.84
interesting

1202.38 --> 1207.8400000000001
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1207.84
hmm

1218.84 --> 1225.12
hmm

1221.52 --> 1225.44
anyway uh yeah they're still not gonna

1225.12 --> 1229.6789999999999
be

1225.44 --> 1234.799
flatter debates so i'm gonna

1229.679 --> 1237.8400000000001
do this show for roughly two hours

1234.799 --> 1237.84
i'll start a little late

1238.32 --> 1241.84
so it's going to be an hour and 40

1240.32 --> 1244.32
minutes i guess something in that

1241.84 --> 1244.32
direction

1246.72 --> 1251.28
but yeah talking about food now

1251.6 --> 1256.3999999999999
but i'm ready to move on to uh yeah more

1254.4 --> 1261.2
flat earth debate or even

1256.4 --> 1264.72
yeah let's talk about globers holy [ __ ]

1261.2 --> 1267.1200000000001
like nick was in the chat

1264.72 --> 1268.64
over at spurs chemos and eventually

1267.12 --> 1270.4799999999998
right to hand too

1268.64 --> 1271.679
it was just terrible but it was kind of

1270.48 --> 1274.0
hanging in there

1271.679 --> 1277.2
the debate that was going on was pretty

1274.0 --> 1279.039
it was pretty good

1277.2 --> 1281.1200000000001
yeah typical like ballers were just

1279.039 --> 1283.039
struggling and just peer pressuring and

1281.12 --> 1285.36
and forgetting that they were

1283.039 --> 1286.1589999999999
losing the argument and just typical

1285.36 --> 1289.12
[ __ ]

1286.159 --> 1291.3600000000001
but in the chat like nick l actually

1289.12 --> 1294.8799999999999
said that boyle's law

1291.36 --> 1297.52
does like this is just another level of

1294.88 --> 1297.5200000000002
idiocy

1300.159 --> 1305.8400000000001
where is it

1310.72 --> 1314.4
oh yeah and it wasn't bad by the way i

1312.799 --> 1319.84
thought i was banned

1314.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
i wasn't uh

1322.24 --> 1328.64
right he said boyle's law doesn't

1325.36 --> 1333.12
apply to the

1328.64 --> 1336.24
universe or the earth

1333.12 --> 1340.0
still have the image of chat maybe i'll

1336.24 --> 1340.0
share that for a second i know it's

1340.24 --> 1344.84
but at this point i just feel like a

1342.32 --> 1349.6
collector of

1344.84 --> 1349.6
crazy baller remarks

1353.12 --> 1355.52
you know

1358.159 --> 1361.8400000000001
all right

1365.039 --> 1368.1589999999999
so yeah he said that

1372.08 --> 1375.76
and yeah he actually doubled down on it

1374.72 --> 1377.919
too

1375.76 --> 1380.08
so yeah just like the law of

1377.919 --> 1382.48
thermodynamics apparently doesn't apply

1380.08 --> 1387.12
to the earth according to rumpus

1382.48 --> 1390.0
and some other deeper ballers

1387.12 --> 1392.9599999999998
nick now says that boyle's law basically

1390.0 --> 1392.96
never applies

1393.2 --> 1396.799
so why is it a law then why is it still

1395.52 --> 1398.8799999999999
standing

1396.799 --> 1400.08
because i'm pretty sure it does apply to

1398.88 --> 1401.8400000000001
gas pressure

1400.08 --> 1404.0
like it's the thing that kind of

1401.84 --> 1406.0
calculates the situation with gas

1404.0 --> 1409.039
pressure in a container and everything

1406.0 --> 1412.0
but apparently it doesn't apply

1409.039 --> 1413.52
to anything like not to the earth not to

1412.0 --> 1416.72
the universe so

1413.52 --> 1417.76
if it's a law then why doesn't it apply

1416.72 --> 1420.88
to anything

1417.76 --> 1424.08
well he argued that it only works

1420.88 --> 1425.6000000000001
with ideal circumstances well then it

1424.08 --> 1428.72
wouldn't be a law

1425.6 --> 1430.48
it would be a hypothesis

1428.72 --> 1432.4
sort of situation that that's what it

1430.48 --> 1432.96
would be categorized it would be a law a

1432.4 --> 1434.96
law

1432.96 --> 1436.96
is only made a law when it actually

1434.96 --> 1439.3600000000001
applies to a system

1436.96 --> 1441.279
to a situation if it doesn't apply it's

1439.36 --> 1443.4399999999998
only theoretical

1441.279 --> 1444.96
and it doesn't you can't actually

1443.44 --> 1446.799
demonstrate it's never going to be

1444.96 --> 1447.1200000000001
classified a law so i thought it was

1446.799 --> 1450.24
just

1447.12 --> 1450.2399999999998
so absurd here

1450.559 --> 1456.0
that i i wanted to highlight that for a

1453.679 --> 1456.0
second

1456.32 --> 1460.96
yeah according to nick boyle's law

1459.039 --> 1462.799
doesn't apply to the earth or the

1460.96 --> 1473.8400000000001
universe

1462.799 --> 1473.84
brilliant what will they think of next

1478.4 --> 1484.88
uh good servant no no

1481.6 --> 1486.6399999999999
no no right hand does not have good

1484.88 --> 1489.279
intentions

1486.64 --> 1489.279
he doesn't

1492.24 --> 1498.96
his sole intention is to be the king

1496.64 --> 1500.3200000000002
he's a secret king he's a gamma he's a

1498.96 --> 1504.96
full full-blown

1500.32 --> 1508.24
gamma in maximum slovenia mode maximum

1504.96 --> 1510.72
and he is insane because even if you try

1508.24 --> 1513.76
to be peaceful with him he is just going

1510.72 --> 1517.679
to start attacking out of nowhere

1513.76 --> 1519.679
he's a maniac like a real maniac

1517.679 --> 1521.919
like you're just going around and you

1519.679 --> 1523.76
think yeah this is awesome and suddenly

1521.919 --> 1525.2
out of nowhere he's insulted by

1523.76 --> 1528.799
something and he just

1525.2 --> 1529.1200000000001
starts to brutally emotionally attack

1528.799 --> 1532.08
you

1529.12 --> 1532.799
out of nowhere and he does it every

1532.08 --> 1536.96
freaking

1532.799 --> 1540.0
time because he's a maniac

1536.96 --> 1543.1200000000001
a real maniac like i

1540.0 --> 1543.44
have issues socially you know they never

1543.12 --> 1546.559
do

1543.44 --> 1549.279
that that's just absurd

1546.559 --> 1550.0
you know i can basically get hot-headed

1549.279 --> 1553.279
and then

1550.0 --> 1555.279
show some hard-liner sight

1553.279 --> 1558.08
as it were it would used to be called

1555.279 --> 1561.2
like really right wing or whatever i did

1558.08 --> 1561.1999999999998
i don't think it's just

1561.52 --> 1565.44
a burning sense of justice that just

1564.48 --> 1569.2
kind of

1565.44 --> 1572.24
yeah it is rage

1569.2 --> 1573.039
you know that i have that but that's not

1572.24 --> 1575.279
something that

1573.039 --> 1576.559
like oh you're going along with somebody

1575.279 --> 1578.799
and yeah they

1576.559 --> 1579.9189999999999
everyone might accidentally say

1578.799 --> 1581.679
something stupid

1579.919 --> 1583.5200000000002
or reference something that they think

1581.679 --> 1586.159
is funny and you think it's disgusting

1583.52 --> 1588.72
you know especially as a flat earther as

1586.159 --> 1589.2
deep as i went it's very likely to

1588.72 --> 1592.48
happen

1589.2 --> 1594.88
guess what i'll never start attacking a

1592.48 --> 1598.08
person over that

1594.88 --> 1599.3600000000001
he does constantly not just in public in

1598.08 --> 1602.48
one-on-one

1599.36 --> 1605.6789999999999
the guy is a maniac

1602.48 --> 1608.64
oh hey sleeping warrior

1605.679 --> 1608.64
can send a photo

1610.0 --> 1613.84
king of the north

1616.24 --> 1627.84
see he's not even king of his own mind

1628.88 --> 1632.3190000000002
[Music]

1638.84 --> 1641.84
uh

1645.84 --> 1651.76
yeah and and just just to put another

1649.44 --> 1652.559
layer on top of that okay i was there

1651.76 --> 1655.6
basically

1652.559 --> 1657.84
going pretty hard against nick

1655.6 --> 1658.6399999999999
calling it basically going nathony and

1657.84 --> 1660.399
after him

1658.64 --> 1662.0
exactly like nathan does in chat

1660.399 --> 1664.0
sometimes you know just like really

1662.0 --> 1664.399
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you really think

1664.0 --> 1668.64
this

1664.399 --> 1673.12
you are just so unbelievably stupid

1668.64 --> 1675.76
like like that style then he came in

1673.12 --> 1678.7199999999998
and he started attacking me calling me a

1675.76 --> 1681.76
baller addressing my behavior

1678.72 --> 1682.72
and then actually siding with the

1681.76 --> 1685.84
freaking nick

1682.72 --> 1688.88
and the other idiots ballers in there

1685.84 --> 1692.799
against me so it's like dude

1688.88 --> 1696.24
you are such a savonia you're just

1692.799 --> 1700.24
treachery is default like you don't

1696.24 --> 1702.559
care about who is on the right side

1700.24 --> 1703.279
or even you're not you don't you just

1702.559 --> 1705.279
want to win

1703.279 --> 1706.799
you want to win no matter what you'd

1705.279 --> 1709.679
step

1706.799 --> 1710.0
your body in the back in the last second

1710.0 --> 1716.399
so you can be the number one is such a

1713.799 --> 1721.039
disgusting guy

yeah it's like that here too it's

1834.799 --> 1851.84
extremely moist i think like 74

1837.52 --> 1851.84
or something

1868.32 --> 1873.039
yeah was it's a bit early for that here

1876.72 --> 1882.48
i prefer to wait till it's

1879.76 --> 1886.0
evening at least because before that

1882.48 --> 1886.0
time it's gonna be just way too hot

1890.84 --> 1893.84
anyway

1896.08 --> 1899.84
i'm gonna put on the fan for a second

1905.519 --> 1909.84
it's like even with the foot bath it it

1908.32 --> 1911.76
does help for like the

1909.84 --> 1913.039
lower part of my body but still the

1911.76 --> 1919.91
upper part still

1913.039 --> 1923.299
just remains overheated

1919.91 --> 1923.299
[Applause]

1949.56 --> 1955.519
[Music]

1951.76 --> 1955.519
uh anyway

1959.279 --> 1963.84
else was it doing

1967.76 --> 1973.76
oh yeah i i found out there was a new

1971.519 --> 1977.76
star wars series apparently

1973.76 --> 1980.799
it's very silly because i got it from

1977.76 --> 1981.919
the mark sergeant show this morning i

1980.799 --> 1984.48
was watching

1981.919 --> 1986.72
the mandalorian i just thought what the

1984.48 --> 1988.88
hell is that supposed to be anyway

1986.72 --> 1990.48
so i looked it up and apparently it's a

1988.88 --> 1994.0800000000002
new star wars series

1990.48 --> 1997.84
about the is it again

1994.08 --> 1998.8799999999999
bobo fett or i don't know father of bobo

1997.84 --> 2002.24
i don't know what it is

1998.88 --> 2003.2
but i downloaded it and yeah kind of

2002.24 --> 2006.32
curious

2003.2 --> 2009.8400000000001
i don't know if it's gonna be good but

2006.32 --> 2013.279
yeah as long as it's

2009.84 --> 2016.84
better as picard because that series

2013.279 --> 2018.96
is just i can't even continue watching

2016.84 --> 2024.24
it

2018.96 --> 2026.72
baby yoda is that in there the baby yoda

2024.24 --> 2026.72
sheesh

2029.12 --> 2035.6
oh giddy and sick it's a series so it's

2032.48 --> 2035.6
always going to be different

2038.96 --> 2042.88
okay dang so the baby yoda is that came

2041.519 --> 2046.0
from the mandalorian

2042.88 --> 2049.2000000000003
okay because i have heard

2046.0 --> 2052.32
like yeah the baby yoda was a real thing

2049.2 --> 2054.3199999999997
or everybody was being driven nuts with

2052.32 --> 2057.28
baby yodas everywhere

2054.32 --> 2058.639
so i definitely caught that one i didn't

2057.28 --> 2060.8
just didn't really care

2058.639 --> 2064.48
this is like oh baby yo the baby yo i'm

2060.8 --> 2064.48
like i don't want to know

2065.76 --> 2069.599
i'll bump into it sooner or later

2070.56 --> 2075.839
yeah and i did

2084.56 --> 2089.7599999999998
i am getting closer to the 2k subs

2087.52 --> 2094.0
really

2089.76 --> 2094.0
no not really

2095.599 --> 2100.2400000000002
i think like the amount of subscribers

2097.599 --> 2103.44
i've gained this year

2100.24 --> 2108.72
so far is

2103.44 --> 2108.7200000000003
i don't know maybe a hundred

2109.76 --> 2116.079
it's yeah it's pretty much after the

2112.88 --> 2119.6800000000003
1.6 so that point it like really

2116.079 --> 2121.8
just stopped it actually got caught on

2119.68 --> 2124.3999999999996
exactly

2121.8 --> 2127.76
720 subscribers for

2124.4 --> 2129.6800000000003
two months non-stop exactly the same

2127.76 --> 2132.2400000000002
amount like nobody subscribed or

2129.68 --> 2145.839
unsubscribed for two months

2132.24 --> 2145.839
totally weird

2150.48 --> 2158.48
i don't know did i ban cleary

2153.92 --> 2161.2000000000003
if i did he probably deserved it

2158.48 --> 2161.2
but i don't know

2169.119 --> 2172.32
okay was what that just goes to show

2171.2 --> 2175.839
that it's been

2172.32 --> 2179.599
almost two years or at least a full year

2175.839 --> 2179.599
since you've last checked up on me

2184.839 --> 2187.839
so

2198.839 --> 2204.64
ugh

2201.839 --> 2204.64
ah that's all right

2212.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
hey drunkenbot four one one

2231.04 --> 2234.4
i seem to be getting a lot of uh people

2233.68 --> 2239.1189999999997
from the

2234.4 --> 2241.839
from down on there and all that

2239.119 --> 2243.04
since the whole insane lockdown [ __ ]

2241.839 --> 2245.119
started to happen there

2243.04 --> 2248.079
i've really noticed this have have the

2245.119 --> 2250.8
rest of you in my chat also noticed that

2248.079 --> 2252.0
there seemed to be a lot of australians

2250.8 --> 2253.6800000000003
in

2252.0 --> 2255.28
well that probably i expect new

2253.68 --> 2258.8799999999997
zealanders to come back too

2255.28 --> 2260.8
because i read somewhere yesterday that

2258.88 --> 2263.2000000000003
now apparently in new zealand they want

2260.8 --> 2266.2400000000002
to do the same kind of lockdown [ __ ]

2263.2 --> 2266.7999999999997
as in victoria and people are pissed off

2266.24 --> 2271.7599999999998
about it

2266.8 --> 2274.8590000000004
of course so yeah

2271.76 --> 2274.8590000000004
[Music]

2285.119 --> 2287.839
just auckland

2292.48 --> 2299.839
yeah it's just idiotic

2303.71 --> 2306.889
[Music]

2310.48 --> 2314.96
i'm the best should have a hundred

2312.64 --> 2318.48
viewers each show i don't know man

2314.96 --> 2322.079
i'm not that good come on it's just me

2318.48 --> 2326.16
sitting here no music a bit of a silly

2322.079 --> 2329.44
repeating moving background thingy and

2326.16 --> 2333.04
i don't know i'm just not that

2329.44 --> 2336.4
adapted to the format of what i guess

2333.04 --> 2340.24
gives the feel of a real real show

2336.4 --> 2343.44
no i'm more of a i'm live

2340.24 --> 2346.72
i'm alive i'm live i'm real

2343.44 --> 2350.7200000000003
i'm improvised every step of the way

2346.72 --> 2354.16
i try to be as open as i can

2350.72 --> 2358.16
beyond financial interest

2354.16 --> 2362.24
of my own basically and that i guess

2358.16 --> 2363.92
that last part is unique

2362.24 --> 2366.3199999999997
because there's people out there that

2363.92 --> 2369.839
say yeah we don't make money of this

2366.32 --> 2372.88
oh i'm not asking any money but yet

2369.839 --> 2375.2799999999997
at the same time they do like wanna they

2372.88 --> 2377.119
do adapt themselves to become more

2375.28 --> 2379.6800000000003
popular

2377.119 --> 2381.2000000000003
you know so whether you want it for the

2379.68 --> 2384.8799999999997
honor

2381.2 --> 2389.2
or for the money if you try to

2384.88 --> 2389.2000000000003
adapt yourself to be more popular

2390.72 --> 2396.56
like yeah that's already

2394.72 --> 2398.72
yeah that's something that i tend not to

2396.56 --> 2398.72
do

2398.8 --> 2403.599
i i try to follow an honor code i work

2401.76 --> 2405.8390000000004
it out on the spot i work on that

2403.599 --> 2407.2000000000003
i try to draw other people in to do the

2405.839 --> 2409.599
same thing

2407.2 --> 2411.7599999999998
as far as they can and if they can

2409.599 --> 2415.44
figure it out

2411.76 --> 2418.5600000000004
but i'm not like adapting what i do

2415.44 --> 2421.2000000000003
and how i am to what i think

2418.56 --> 2422.56
would be more suited for the rest of the

2421.2 --> 2424.319
people

2422.56 --> 2426.56
because i'd have a whole lot of

2424.319 --> 2428.8
adaptation to do and you'd probably not

2426.56 --> 2431.52
even recognize me anymore

2428.8 --> 2432.7200000000003
and i wouldn't even recognize me anymore

2431.52 --> 2435.68
and then it would all become

2432.72 --> 2436.72
pointless to me because what i do the

2435.68 --> 2439.1189999999997
way that i do it

2436.72 --> 2442.3999999999996
is like a life building process and it

2439.119 --> 2442.4
actually builds me

2442.64 --> 2450.0
it actually builds me

2446.0 --> 2454.16
not just a story in the show no

2450.0 --> 2454.96
i actually gain better insights better

2454.16 --> 2458.0
confidence

2454.96 --> 2461.52
more energy

2458.0 --> 2463.52
more self-respect more connectibility

2461.52 --> 2466.64
with the outside world even though i'm

2463.52 --> 2469.839
very like paranoid even

2466.64 --> 2473.1189999999997
like very retractive naturally

2469.839 --> 2475.119
although yes i do get alone so if i do

2473.119 --> 2477.2000000000003
feel like there is this connection

2475.119 --> 2479.52
possibility with a person

2477.2 --> 2482.16
i will then take that opportunity if it

2479.52 --> 2484.079
just feels right

2482.16 --> 2485.7599999999998
but i'm not somebody that is constantly

2484.079 --> 2486.2400000000002
going out constantly hanging with

2485.76 --> 2489.599
friends

2486.24 --> 2492.8799999999997
never never i do

2489.599 --> 2496.0
like that but i can't do that

2492.88 --> 2499.44
continually i don't like drown

2496.0 --> 2501.28
in a group i can't do that at some point

2499.44 --> 2504.0
i get saturated and then i have to step

2501.28 --> 2506.4
away and take take a breather like

2504.0 --> 2509.839
get my mind out of the collective

2506.4 --> 2509.839
thinking and all that

2512.0 --> 2517.599
anyway there's probably more people that

2515.2 --> 2517.5989999999997
have that

2520.56 --> 2526.88
right it is technically cell therapy

2524.079 --> 2526.88
it is open

2533.68 --> 2537.2
and that's also an advantage if you're

2535.76 --> 2539.2000000000003
just open and honest

2537.2 --> 2540.7999999999997
that and one hand it is brave and on the

2539.2 --> 2542.48
other hand you have to just be very

2540.8 --> 2543.119
careful with what you're aiming for if

2542.48 --> 2546.56
you're going to be

2543.119 --> 2547.04
luciferian in any objective it's going

2546.56 --> 2551.839
to go

2547.04 --> 2551.839
wrong if you persist

2553.119 --> 2557.44
with the openness you know that's why

2555.599 --> 2561.119
secrecy is so convenient to

2557.44 --> 2561.119
devious thinkers

2561.68 --> 2569.52
but i'm all honest i'm all open so

2565.839 --> 2570.319
yeah that builds it it shows the example

2569.52 --> 2572.96
and it is like

2570.319 --> 2574.88
therapy well yeah normally with a

2572.96 --> 2578.7200000000003
therapist typically

2574.88 --> 2581.44
it can be good it can be not good

2578.72 --> 2582.48
it all depends on how where the the

2581.44 --> 2584.7200000000003
person that is

2582.48 --> 2585.52
taking the therapy is is aware of how

2584.72 --> 2587.839
things work

2585.52 --> 2589.599
and of who they're facing who's trying

2587.839 --> 2592.319
to help them and how

2589.599 --> 2594.1600000000003
because therapists can just be

2592.319 --> 2597.359
completely off track

2594.16 --> 2598.0789999999997
sometimes they really don't get it they

2597.359 --> 2599.68
don't get

2598.079 --> 2602.0
the person they don't get what's going

2599.68 --> 2603.68
they don't get what is actually needed

2602.0 --> 2605.359
and they start to project their own

2603.68 --> 2606.0
ideas of how things are supposed to be

2605.359 --> 2609.04
done on top

2606.0 --> 2610.079
of it because they don't really listen

2609.04 --> 2614.16
they can't handle it

2610.079 --> 2617.44
they still go on i have systems for that

2614.16 --> 2618.48
even though you're not hitting the

2617.44 --> 2620.96
target

2618.48 --> 2622.48
you still go on and that's yeah that's

2620.96 --> 2625.839
built into that

2622.48 --> 2628.079
discipline to that profession

2625.839 --> 2630.64
so if you just do it out in the open

2628.079 --> 2632.8
that situation is not going to happen

2630.64 --> 2634.16
because everything is blatantly obvious

2632.8 --> 2637.3590000000004
everybody can

2634.16 --> 2639.52
look in everybody can see and

2637.359 --> 2641.44
judge you just have to be respectful and

2639.52 --> 2645.92
if you can't

2641.44 --> 2649.28
yeah you'll get banned of course and hey

2645.92 --> 2651.28
you know in this way the ballers are

2649.28 --> 2653.6800000000003
always looking at flat earthers in

2651.28 --> 2656.2400000000002
situations to see if they can find some

2653.68 --> 2658.0789999999997
weakness that they can basically

2656.24 --> 2660.0789999999997
hammer them over the head with for the

2658.079 --> 2661.6800000000003
moment you know they always do this the

2660.079 --> 2664.1600000000003
bad ones not saying that

2661.68 --> 2665.5989999999997
guys in chat here that are ballers do

2664.16 --> 2667.5989999999997
that as well but

2665.599 --> 2669.44
you know what i mean people like nick

2667.599 --> 2672.4
and all that they always do that

2669.44 --> 2672.96
always always always so if i'm just

2672.4 --> 2675.28
going to be

2672.96 --> 2676.64
open and honest and working and actually

2675.28 --> 2678.079
showing that i am

2676.64 --> 2680.4
for real and that i'm really doing my

2678.079 --> 2681.119
best i'm not just virtue signaling to

2680.4 --> 2684.8
improve

2681.119 --> 2688.1600000000003
but i'm actually doing it

2684.8 --> 2688.1600000000003
just like that in the open

2688.839 --> 2695.04
then they can't

2692.0 --> 2697.92
really use that because

2695.04 --> 2700.079
no matter how you reason your way around

2697.92 --> 2704.8
it it is a sign of strength to just

2700.079 --> 2707.44
do it and they can't that's why

2704.8 --> 2709.119
i don't know they they don't they watch

2707.44 --> 2711.04
my show

2709.119 --> 2713.359
and sometimes when they go irwinian

2711.04 --> 2715.52
crazy or ragey or whatever yeah they may

2713.359 --> 2718.0
make a little clip you know that but

2715.52 --> 2721.04
when i'm just talking when i'm serious

2718.0 --> 2722.88
they don't do anything with it because

2721.04 --> 2725.119
they can't because if they use it

2722.88 --> 2726.2400000000002
it'll show too much strength and even

2725.119 --> 2729.52
though they could

2726.24 --> 2732.64
afterward try to blabber all over it

2729.52 --> 2736.0
it's just gonna slide right off there

2732.64 --> 2736.0
that's why they never do that

2740.72 --> 2744.64
so yeah it's it's weird how that works

2742.96 --> 2746.4
apparently all these people even the

2744.64 --> 2749.44
ones that are banned are just

2746.4 --> 2752.4
they really do still watch me

2749.44 --> 2754.7200000000003
i wonder how many because i got hundreds

2752.4 --> 2761.2000000000003
of people blocked like are they all

2754.72 --> 2763.4399999999996
are they all still watching

2761.2 --> 2765.04
now and i have unblocked many people as

2763.44 --> 2767.52
well you know this

2765.04 --> 2768.64
because there is this possibility to

2767.52 --> 2774.0
just request

2768.64 --> 2776.64
to be unblocked if you do it right

2774.0 --> 2777.68
if it's obvious that you're not just

2776.64 --> 2779.44
like oh oh

2777.68 --> 2780.72
i got a blabber all over your show

2779.44 --> 2783.44
because yeah

2780.72 --> 2785.2799999999997
when people are like that that shows

2783.44 --> 2786.7200000000003
that i'm not gonna unblock you

2785.28 --> 2788.4
you're gonna suck around and all that

2786.72 --> 2792.319
you know that

2788.4 --> 2795.359
so yeah you can be unblocked in my show

2792.319 --> 2796.4
if if yeah if you just show signs that

2795.359 --> 2803.04
it's

2796.4 --> 2804.7200000000003
that you're actually going to behave

2803.04 --> 2806.8
and with some people that's never gonna

2804.72 --> 2810.7999999999997
happen like right to hand

2806.8 --> 2812.48
because he can't not for long anyway

2810.8 --> 2813.8390000000004
like not longer than two minutes after

2812.48 --> 2817.839
that it's gonna go wrong

2813.839 --> 2817.839
every single time

2818.64 --> 2821.7599999999998
oh getting sick you've not slept in 24

2821.04 --> 2831.04
hours

2821.76 --> 2834.7200000000003
sheesh that doesn't sound good buddy

2831.04 --> 2834.72
i try to do something about that

2835.68 --> 2838.7999999999997
professor irwin

2839.2 --> 2844.64
oh heat heat situation for you too

2841.92 --> 2859.839
getting sick

2844.64 --> 2859.839
yeah well

2870.96 --> 2875.359
well sleeping warrior the thing is you

2874.0 --> 2878.079
know

2875.359 --> 2878.88
people with the psychological issues the

2878.079 --> 2881.6800000000003
vultarts

2878.88 --> 2883.44
that go with the socks you know the more

2881.68 --> 2885.2799999999997
socks they have

2883.44 --> 2887.599
the more present they are and in your

2885.28 --> 2890.8
face on the internet

2887.599 --> 2892.48
you could pretty much guarantee yourself

2890.8 --> 2894.319
i can guarantee you let's say it like

2892.48 --> 2897.119
that that the more

2894.319 --> 2897.52
socks they have on the internet the less

2897.119 --> 2900.0
they

2897.52 --> 2902.4
actually physically engage people in the

2900.0 --> 2905.76
real world

2902.4 --> 2909.28
it's an over compensation

2905.76 --> 2911.76
you know they are very present in their

2909.28 --> 2912.48
troll form on the internet because

2911.76 --> 2914.96
that's

2912.48 --> 2917.2
presence is like the urge like oh i want

2914.96 --> 2919.76
to be somebody i want to be

2917.2 --> 2920.319
noticed i want to be respected something

2919.76 --> 2923.5200000000004
because

2920.319 --> 2924.16
they don't have that naturally when

2923.52 --> 2926.079
facing

2924.16 --> 2928.319
other people face to face because yeah

2926.079 --> 2929.92
they can see exactly who they are

2928.319 --> 2931.92
they can see the look on their face they

2929.92 --> 2933.76
can see the karma

2931.92 --> 2935.52
and the sins that they are carrying and

2933.76 --> 2936.96
how they are fooling themselves even if

2935.52 --> 2938.64
they don't know what it's about

2936.96 --> 2940.079
you know if you're fooling yourself

2938.64 --> 2942.8799999999997
really badly

2940.079 --> 2944.319
that literally is visible to people

2942.88 --> 2947.2000000000003
especially

2944.319 --> 2948.8
yeah mothers mothers can see that most

2947.2 --> 2951.2
of them

2948.8 --> 2952.0
so even if they don't know what the

2951.2 --> 2956.8799999999997
subject is

2952.0 --> 2958.96
about it's visible to people

2956.88 --> 2960.96
and yeah they know this so that's why

2958.96 --> 2964.2400000000002
they then go on the internet

2960.96 --> 2967.359
and then put their presence

2964.24 --> 2968.3999999999996
full full force in there to

2967.359 --> 2972.88
overcompensate

2968.4 --> 2976.0
for their pro yeah their timid timidness

2972.88 --> 2979.76
in their real physical life

2976.0 --> 2979.76
so that yeah that's my theory for that

2983.359 --> 2987.5989999999997
you know right this is total logic

2987.839 --> 2991.2799999999997
it's basically just like it is a form of

2990.559 --> 2994.96
a nerd

2991.28 --> 2995.76
syndrome it's what in the 80s and the

2994.96 --> 2997.92
90s

2995.76 --> 2999.44
the nerds and their computers when their

2997.92 --> 2999.839
the internet was not rampant and all

2999.44 --> 3002.079
that

2999.839 --> 3004.64
that's what they did with the computers

3002.079 --> 3005.599
they overcompensated on the computers

3004.64 --> 3008.72
because they couldn't

3005.599 --> 3010.6400000000003
interact physically well now these bald

3008.72 --> 3012.7999999999997
hearts and religious fanatics

3010.64 --> 3014.0
anti-social people out there they're

3012.8 --> 3017.3590000000004
doing the same thing

3014.0 --> 3017.359
but with social media

3017.92 --> 3022.96
so it is kind of like there are kind of

3021.119 --> 3027.119
nerds

3022.96 --> 3029.52
like that they're just not

3027.119 --> 3030.7200000000003
really well educated nerds even though

3029.52 --> 3032.319
most of them seem to

3030.72 --> 3034.0789999999997
think they're really well educated

3032.319 --> 3036.4
because

3034.079 --> 3037.92
they got google on their computer and

3036.4 --> 3039.359
they think that then that means they

3037.92 --> 3042.8
understand everything

3039.359 --> 3042.7999999999997
which is just wrong

3044.64 --> 3051.5989999999997
so yeah unlike the nerds of old

3048.559 --> 3053.92
who were usually kind of smart

3051.599 --> 3054.96
or not very socially wise these people

3053.92 --> 3058.319
are not smart

3054.96 --> 3060.48
either some of them are sort of smart

3058.319 --> 3060.48
but

3061.52 --> 3066.0
i don't know the lack of wisdom and just

3063.92 --> 3069.28
the inability to let reality

3066.0 --> 3071.28
sink in so you can get things for real

3069.28 --> 3072.559
that just completely outdoes the

3071.28 --> 3074.4
intelligence

3072.559 --> 3077.2000000000003
because it's trapped the intelligence is

3074.4 --> 3078.96
trapped within the religious syndrome

3077.2 --> 3080.96
it can't do anything it always has to

3078.96 --> 3082.079
abide by the stupid religious rules to

3080.96 --> 3085.44
keep

3082.079 --> 3091.28
the consciousness within that dream

3085.44 --> 3091.28
it's really tragic i know i used to be

3094.839 --> 3097.839
there

3120.4 --> 3125.839
sleeping warrior really does google say

3122.4 --> 3125.839
that that's bizarre

3130.64 --> 3139.839
same thing i was wearing a year ago was

3134.0 --> 3139.839
same thing

3150.64 --> 3154.24
all right mark collard interesting

3155.44 --> 3162.88
you know that fresh alloy gel

3160.079 --> 3163.3590000000004
like if you take a plant and you just

3162.88 --> 3165.44
cut

3163.359 --> 3166.64
the outer leaf off it you have like this

3165.44 --> 3168.64
gelatine

3166.64 --> 3169.68
that stuff just raw you can just take a

3168.64 --> 3171.52
leaf with you it's

3169.68 --> 3173.359
it can like take a lot of heat too you

3171.52 --> 3175.44
know it doesn't dry out naturally

3173.359 --> 3176.72
or if you just take that gel you can rub

3175.44 --> 3178.7200000000003
yourself

3176.72 --> 3180.5589999999997
arms and shoulders and all that in with

3178.72 --> 3185.4399999999996
it and that's

3180.559 --> 3188.3190000000004
really good works against sunburns

3185.44 --> 3189.52
like to prevent it and even if it's

3188.319 --> 3192.24
already happen

3189.52 --> 3193.68
works really well and if you like the

3192.24 --> 3195.68
taste that's good on you

3193.68 --> 3197.2799999999997
i think the taste is absolutely

3195.68 --> 3200.16
disgusting

3197.28 --> 3201.28
but yeah that's why it's for rubbing on

3200.16 --> 3204.319
your skin

3201.28 --> 3206.079
or take i you have these concentrated

3204.319 --> 3209.2799999999997
capsules

3206.079 --> 3210.8
too i used to take them a while back

3209.28 --> 3212.559
that also works really well as an

3210.8 --> 3214.6400000000003
anti-sunburn

3212.559 --> 3217.119
but yeah it's disgusting the stuff i

3214.64 --> 3219.04
don't like the taste of alloy

3217.119 --> 3221.2000000000003
yeah like of the real plant taste i

3219.04 --> 3222.88
don't like that at all

3221.2 --> 3225.2799999999997
but it is really good for your skin

3222.88 --> 3228.319
though and even to eat it is is healthy

3225.28 --> 3228.3190000000004
if you can bear the taste

3234.319 --> 3238.8
all right more colored if it doesn't

3236.64 --> 3242.64
really taste like the fresh

3238.8 --> 3242.6400000000003
then it's probably an extract

3243.839 --> 3248.7999999999997
pineapple pulp right then they just put

3246.319 --> 3250.8
some aloe extract in there

3248.8 --> 3252.6400000000003
you know the the same way like they

3250.8 --> 3257.119
sometimes in certain drinks or

3252.64 --> 3259.839
foods they do do put extra spirulina

3257.119 --> 3260.7200000000003
in there well that's usually an extract

3259.839 --> 3263.68
too because if you

3260.72 --> 3264.9599999999996
literally put the yeah the as is

3263.68 --> 3279.44
spirulina

3264.96 --> 3281.76
it changes the taste dramatically

3279.44 --> 3281.76
hmm

3283.119 --> 3290.88
hey crisbury gluten morgan

3287.68 --> 3293.839
uh we don't do glutens

3290.88 --> 3293.839
i don't

3300.11 --> 3303.6690000000003
[Music]

3308.48 --> 3313.44
yeah yeah lg are the best

3314.72 --> 3322.3999999999996
yeah you know technically i take a

3318.72 --> 3325.04
a fundamental set of supplements

3322.4 --> 3327.92
that are like kind of easily available

3325.04 --> 3331.04
that work really well for me and that is

3327.92 --> 3334.16
fish oil spirulina capsule or

3331.04 --> 3337.2
like uh a tablet like a

3334.16 --> 3340.799
green tablet uh

3337.2 --> 3345.04
aztec sentine which is a

3340.799 --> 3345.04
an lg extract

3345.44 --> 3351.68
those three and

3349.119 --> 3351.6800000000003
what else

3356.319 --> 3364.5589999999997
like a selenium complex and it has

3362.24 --> 3367.2799999999997
it has some turmeric in there as well

3364.559 --> 3370.799
and if you combine all that together

3367.28 --> 3374.0
it's like this oceanic

3370.799 --> 3377.04
blubber bit is like

3374.0 --> 3380.0
fish algae uh

3377.04 --> 3381.599
seaweed it's very oceanic and you put

3380.0 --> 3382.079
some tumeric in there and some other

3381.599 --> 3385.599
stuff

3382.079 --> 3387.44
it's like yeah that's like the ultimate

3385.599 --> 3389.6800000000003
combination for me and it's all things

3387.44 --> 3391.839
that i don't like

3389.68 --> 3393.359
i'm just very happy that i can swallow

3391.839 --> 3395.2799999999997
those things whole and i don't have to

3393.359 --> 3397.52
chew it to get it in

3395.28 --> 3398.96
but it works so well for me i've been

3397.52 --> 3405.04
taking that for some time

3398.96 --> 3419.839
it works really well together

3405.04 --> 3419.839
take it every morning

3422.799 --> 3430.839
hmm all right yeah getting sick yeah

3426.24 --> 3433.52
i guess that like really fresh

3430.839 --> 3436.0789999999997
spirulina is yeah it's gonna be

3433.52 --> 3436.079
even better

3437.04 --> 3440.16
only buy in bulk

3440.24 --> 3446.0789999999997
yeah well how i'm just wondering like

3443.92 --> 3450.96
how tough is it even to like make

3446.079 --> 3453.6800000000003
your own like oceanic farm or something

3450.96 --> 3454.319
couldn't you just like get your own like

3453.68 --> 3461.04
get a

3454.319 --> 3464.48
what is it uh it's called again

3461.04 --> 3468.24
is that a urban farming something like

3464.48 --> 3471.28
that aquaponics an aquaponics system

3468.24 --> 3475.4399999999996
where you literally breed

3471.28 --> 3478.079
things like spirulina algae fish

3475.44 --> 3480.48
like could could that be all put into a

3478.079 --> 3480.48
cycle

3481.52 --> 3485.839
that would be so amazing if you could

3484.88 --> 3489.04
have like a small

3485.839 --> 3490.72
farm freshly of all of it although yes

3489.04 --> 3503.839
squeezing your own fish seems kind of

3490.72 --> 3503.839
gruesome but

3505.52 --> 3512.16
intensely demanding well yeah

3509.119 --> 3514.2400000000002
but it depends on how tough is it how

3512.16 --> 3516.96
how do these typical plants grow the

3514.24 --> 3520.319
best what do they really need

3516.96 --> 3521.119
can you all put that into a giant water

3520.319 --> 3524.16
cycle

3521.119 --> 3526.799
cycled farm with

3524.16 --> 3528.3999999999996
yeah aquaponics applications i wonder if

3526.799 --> 3530.48
that if you could all put it in there

3528.4 --> 3535.44
but you might end up with just a

3530.48 --> 3537.28
giant fish tankish room though

3535.44 --> 3539.04
with a lot of water and a lot of those

3537.28 --> 3541.76
things and it's going to be like a water

3539.04 --> 3541.7599999999998
farm almost

3542.48 --> 3546.559
yeah and then you hope you don't get an

3544.48 --> 3549.68
earthquake

3546.559 --> 3549.6800000000003
because you'd have a problem

3551.119 --> 3556.1600000000003
right yeah hanging garden well

3553.92 --> 3559.28
aquaponics basically already is like a

3556.16 --> 3562.16
hanging garden system with like a fish

3559.28 --> 3564.799
tank as part of it because it utilizes

3562.16 --> 3564.799
the fish poo

3565.44 --> 3574.7200000000003
as fertilizer

3572.88 --> 3576.559
right you would have to indeed do it in

3574.72 --> 3578.24
a big i'm just wondering if is it

3576.559 --> 3581.2000000000003
possible

3578.24 --> 3582.0
or do things like spirulina only grow in

3581.2 --> 3584.8799999999997
proper

3582.0 --> 3585.68
wide oceanic water does it really or can

3584.88 --> 3588.7200000000003
it be

3585.68 --> 3590.319
still effectively grown in a small scale

3588.72 --> 3592.72
situation i don't know

3590.319 --> 3592.72
about it

3594.24 --> 3597.68
but it wouldn't it be really interesting

3595.92 --> 3601.119
to just have your own fresh

3597.68 --> 3602.319
spirulina plants like

3601.119 --> 3604.1600000000003
could you imagine you're like in the

3602.319 --> 3607.68
morning you don't get a pill

3604.16 --> 3610.5589999999997
or some powder or something but you just

3607.68 --> 3611.04
grab in the tank and you just pick a

3610.559 --> 3613.44
fresh

3611.04 --> 3614.88
spirulina and then you juice it just

3613.44 --> 3629.839
like that

3614.88 --> 3629.839
that would be amazing

3631.76 --> 3637.0400000000004
but i love pills and powder yeah so easy

3634.64 --> 3637.04
isn't it

3637.599 --> 3642.079
yeah it's not as rewarding though you

3639.359 --> 3644.319
know that's that's what it's all about

3642.079 --> 3646.4
the fresh things are always more

3644.319 --> 3649.68
rewarding especially because you can

3646.4 --> 3649.6800000000003
take personal care of it

3651.28 --> 3657.6800000000003
and every plant really appreciates that

3653.52 --> 3659.839
if if you actually like doing it

3657.68 --> 3671.839
seems like there's more clouds coming

3659.839 --> 3671.839
looks nice

3672.64 --> 3699.839
yeah this is good hmm

3707.359 --> 3713.839
weeds are the biggest pain in the ass

3710.839 --> 3713.839
maybe

3715.54 --> 3727.839
[Music]

3717.2 --> 3727.839
you have to know what you're doing

3734.0 --> 3741.839
unless you want to grow weed yeah indeed

3752.839 --> 3755.839
oh

3759.359 --> 3773.44
find a weird one

3768.64 --> 3775.359
hmm okay mark collett i didn't know that

3773.44 --> 3777.44
interesting oh yeah yeah thanks for

3775.359 --> 3783.839
popping by was good to see you again

3777.44 --> 3783.839
see you around

3793.55 --> 3797.8390000000004
[Music]

3794.839 --> 3797.839
uh

3808.96 --> 3813.2
yeah yeah i get in sick well you know

3811.599 --> 3814.88
what i'm not like really

3813.2 --> 3816.48
literally into gardening right now

3814.88 --> 3818.079
because i don't really have any room for

3816.48 --> 3820.559
it so

3818.079 --> 3822.079
but i know that even the time when we me

3820.559 --> 3824.4
and my ex were doing that

3822.079 --> 3825.119
that there was just so much information

3824.4 --> 3828.1600000000003
out there like

3825.119 --> 3830.7200000000003
incredible types of knowledge with

3828.16 --> 3833.52
plants and little things and

3830.72 --> 3835.1189999999997
like one plant enhances the performance

3833.52 --> 3838.319
of the other with

3835.119 --> 3839.76
with their roots it's really amazing so

3838.319 --> 3842.4
yeah

3839.76 --> 3844.1600000000003
dude if i if i get an opportunity to

3842.4 --> 3846.559
really get back into gardening

3844.16 --> 3847.7599999999998
for myself a garden that i only have

3846.559 --> 3850.8390000000004
access to

3847.76 --> 3853.8390000000004
yeah i'm gonna try all kinds of things

3850.839 --> 3853.839
out

3864.839 --> 3867.839
man

3889.68 --> 3908.72
but i wouldn't do i like i don't want

3893.599 --> 3910.88
bug repellents really normally uh yeah

3908.72 --> 3912.5589999999997
it depends though you know like what

3910.88 --> 3914.079
kind of bugs are typically gonna bother

3912.559 --> 3915.599
you in the netherlands there's not a lot

3914.079 --> 3919.28
of

3915.599 --> 3922.559
bugs that really like eat

3919.28 --> 3925.6800000000003
fruits or vegetables or anything

3922.559 --> 3926.0
as far as i know but things like snails

3925.68 --> 3929.2799999999997
do

3926.0 --> 3931.599
typically and i think yeah dandelions

3929.28 --> 3932.4
would probably work against snails as

3931.599 --> 3937.839
well

3932.4 --> 3937.839
i'm not too sure but

3941.119 --> 3949.2000000000003
flies yeah but flies are only gonna

3946.559 --> 3952.079
they're not gonna bite into fresh things

3949.2 --> 3955.2
usually they don't do that

3952.079 --> 3955.6800000000003
like unless it is just so insanely hot

3955.2 --> 3957.839
that it

3955.68 --> 3959.44
is like the most convenient place for

3957.839 --> 3965.839
them to get water

3959.44 --> 3965.839
you know otherwise they don't do that

3969.01 --> 3978.88
[Music]

3971.2 --> 3992.64
oh nice b cities are always awesome

3978.88 --> 3995.839
flies are not awesome

3992.64 --> 3997.839
yep yeah setting up housing for bees is

3995.839 --> 4000.319
awesome i have a little household

3997.839 --> 4001.2
or a b hotel as well there's one in

4000.319 --> 4003.359
there

4001.2 --> 4004.3999999999996
i've had since i put that thing there it

4003.359 --> 4006.96
has always been

4004.4 --> 4009.599
at least one up to five bees that are

4006.96 --> 4009.599
staying there

4011.839 --> 4015.2799999999997
and it's really fun and it's like i know

4013.839 --> 4017.119
it's extremely helpful

4015.28 --> 4020.4
for these for these creatures and they

4017.119 --> 4023.2000000000003
do a lot of good

4020.4 --> 4025.44
and it's so easy to do it you just have

4023.2 --> 4027.9199999999996
to find the right spot

4025.44 --> 4029.52
where they're safe from extreme winds or

4027.92 --> 4031.52
water

4029.52 --> 4033.52
because water would destroy typically

4031.52 --> 4035.839
the clay that they used to close off the

4033.52 --> 4035.839
hatch

4035.92 --> 4042.0
and yeah let it be that spot

4039.359 --> 4044.0789999999997
and then eventually the bees will see it

4042.0 --> 4045.76
like a hotel they will or like a motel

4044.079 --> 4047.599
like they know it's there they will

4045.76 --> 4048.96
fly by and then at some point you'd be

4047.599 --> 4051.2000000000003
like oh right

4048.96 --> 4053.52
there's a hotel there i'm gonna stay

4051.2 --> 4055.4399999999996
there because they know it's there

4053.52 --> 4057.599
it's really nice it's it's so little

4055.44 --> 4060.559
effort

4057.599 --> 4060.559
and it helps a lot

4060.96 --> 4064.079
and i like bees so

4066.319 --> 4077.839
boot wasps

4079.359 --> 4084.799
don't come across a lot of exotic wasps

4082.96 --> 4088.96
i have barely seen any

4084.799 --> 4090.64
wasps by the way some but small ones

4088.96 --> 4092.079
and i'm kind of glad about it because i

4090.64 --> 4094.8799999999997
freaking hate wasps

4092.079 --> 4094.88
very annoying

4099.359 --> 4102.159000000001
yeah also

4102.96 --> 4107.44
it's typical because if heat persists

4106.319 --> 4110.080000000001
very long

4107.44 --> 4112.48
in a certain region or any region also

4110.08 --> 4114.4
the netherlands then

4112.48 --> 4116.639999999999
what typically happens if that heat

4114.4 --> 4118.719
stays for too long then wasps

4116.64 --> 4120.799
will start to break out and usually they

4118.719 --> 4122.719
get bigger

4120.799 --> 4124.799
it's weird how that works so yeah if

4122.719 --> 4126.96
this heat wave keeps up then we might

4124.799 --> 4128.08
have some wasp problems here as well

4126.96 --> 4130.2390000000005
eventually

4128.08 --> 4132.239
i've seen it every time if it's like

4130.239 --> 4132.879999999999
really hot for over a month then the

4132.239 --> 4138.639999999999
wasps

4132.88 --> 4138.64
just start to come they just spawn

4143.279 --> 4146.96
but they really only come after heat

4145.359 --> 4149.1990000000005
waves

4146.96 --> 4151.12
yeah the meaner they get they they just

4149.199 --> 4153.2789999999995
go everywhere normally they're probably

4151.12 --> 4156.5599999999995
just hanging around

4153.279 --> 4157.759
their hive and they don't need so much

4156.56 --> 4160.400000000001
or whatever they don't get

4157.759 --> 4161.759
active enough to just go around and get

4160.4 --> 4165.3589999999995
in everybody's face

4161.759 --> 4165.359
because when it's hot they do that

4170.64 --> 4177.839
you know everybody's seen or has been on

4174.0 --> 4179.52
like a vacation with swimming pools

4177.839 --> 4181.199
and it's super hot and you're hanging at

4179.52 --> 4184.319
the swimming pool and then suddenly

4181.199 --> 4187.678999999999
like yeah wasps get in your face yeah

4184.319 --> 4188.96
everybody's had that once at least in

4187.679 --> 4190.96
their life because that typically

4188.96 --> 4194.4
happens when it's super hot

4190.96 --> 4197.36
the wasps come and they start getting

4194.4 --> 4199.36
trying to get in your sugary drink you

4197.36 --> 4201.04
know that really attracts them

4199.36 --> 4203.759999999999
and if you leave your sugary drink on

4201.04 --> 4205.84
the ground then like after a few hours

4203.76 --> 4211.12
ants will start to get in there

4205.84 --> 4211.12
typically yeah

4215.199 --> 4222.0
wasps are like a big kkk no

4218.8 --> 4231.84
kkk is it's lame

4222.0 --> 4231.84
it's a bunch of posers

4233.12 --> 4237.28
now wasps are more like uh

4237.6 --> 4240.56
nah i'm gonna say it

4243.04 --> 4248.48
let's just say so they have a fanatical

4247.12 --> 4252.159
character and they're

4248.48 --> 4255.678999999999
relentless and they don't really

4252.159 --> 4256.879999999999
care about their own survival like they

4255.679 --> 4259.92
let their

4256.88 --> 4262.32
mood their their strategy

4259.92 --> 4264.159
trump their survivability because hey

4262.32 --> 4265.36
technically if they get away if they

4264.159 --> 4267.12
don't bother everyone

4265.36 --> 4268.719
people would just let these creatures go

4267.12 --> 4270.4
around but because they get in

4268.719 --> 4272.08
everybody's face

4270.4 --> 4274.08
yeah if you go to wasp nest you're going

4272.08 --> 4277.199
to get the exterminator

4274.08 --> 4281.28
you know if they weren't so so yeah so

4277.199 --> 4282.799999999999
nasty then

4281.28 --> 4287.759999999999
thanks here we go again yeah i didn't

4282.8 --> 4290.88
want to say it

4287.76 --> 4290.88
but i think you get it

4295.69 --> 4301.0289999999995
[Music]

4320.4 --> 4326.0
oh that sucks ah

4323.76 --> 4327.92
yeah yeah you don't want to get a wasp

4326.0 --> 4328.64
in between your clothes and your skin

4327.92 --> 4343.84
that's

4328.64 --> 4343.84
that's brutal man that's brutal

4352.8 --> 4356.400000000001
yeah you know it's kind of tricky you

4354.64 --> 4359.04
know with wasps

4356.4 --> 4360.48
because typically if you're just out in

4359.04 --> 4362.4
the heat

4360.48 --> 4363.919999999999
they might get attracted to your skin

4362.4 --> 4365.599999999999
you know why it's not because there's

4363.92 --> 4368.0
sugar on your skin or anything but

4365.6 --> 4369.52
because of the minerals the minerals you

4368.0 --> 4373.52
sweat out

4369.52 --> 4376.88
because yeah wasps kind of like that too

4373.52 --> 4378.88
so sometimes yeah you go you got like uh

4376.88 --> 4380.2390000000005
you're sitting in the sun on the beach

4378.88 --> 4382.2390000000005
all day and all that and you got the

4380.239 --> 4385.5199999999995
salt water and skin

4382.239 --> 4387.678999999999
yeah there's a yeah i've had

4385.52 --> 4389.120000000001
after a day where wasps would also just

4387.679 --> 4392.2390000000005
start following me around

4389.12 --> 4393.76
super annoying but if you take a quick

4392.239 --> 4395.919999999999
shower and get it all off

4393.76 --> 4397.6
then usually they'll stop coming after

4395.92 --> 4399.1990000000005
you

4397.6 --> 4413.84
because it is like the minerals on your

4399.199 --> 4413.839999999999
skin they're attracted to as well

4421.6 --> 4425.76
yeah here we go again well i'm not

4423.44 --> 4427.44
really afraid of watch i'm just afraid

4425.76 --> 4429.4400000000005
of them when they suddenly get it in

4427.44 --> 4431.44
their head that they're attracted to me

4429.44 --> 4433.36
you know when they are like insistent to

4431.44 --> 4435.44
get on you some way

4433.36 --> 4436.5599999999995
start biting in you because they do that

4435.44 --> 4439.759999999999
too just take

4436.56 --> 4440.96
bites sometimes really freaking annoying

4439.76 --> 4444.400000000001
they're not stinging you then they're

4440.96 --> 4444.4
just yeah they want the minerals

4444.64 --> 4448.8
when they're they got that you can feel

4447.04 --> 4450.64
i can feel it's like they are

4448.8 --> 4452.320000000001
they are just like they set their mind

4450.64 --> 4454.0
on invading you

4452.32 --> 4455.84
that's really freaky but when they're

4454.0 --> 4457.199
just freaking hanging around or they

4455.84 --> 4459.4400000000005
want to get out or something i'm not

4457.199 --> 4462.799999999999
afraid of wasps as long as they yeah

4459.44 --> 4464.799999999999
i try not to get in their way because

4462.8 --> 4466.2390000000005
especially if they get nervous then they

4464.8 --> 4468.400000000001
do get like pretty

4466.239 --> 4470.239
yeah they basically fly into anything

4468.4 --> 4471.04
including you and they might just sting

4470.239 --> 4475.28
you if you're

4471.04 --> 4475.28
if you're there but

4475.6 --> 4479.52
it's all about their mood if they're in

4477.199 --> 4481.199
a rage yeah that sucks

4479.52 --> 4483.84
or if they're like they want to take a

4481.199 --> 4483.839999999999
bite out of you

4494.8 --> 4498.56
yeah and that's by the way even worse

4496.96 --> 4501.44
with hornets

4498.56 --> 4503.04
really glad we don't have them here i

4501.44 --> 4511.839999999999
hate hornets

4503.04 --> 4511.84
horrifying creatures

4512.64 --> 4516.08
like i don't know they're also called

4514.48 --> 4519.36
horseflies

4516.08 --> 4522.8
of those you know wasps thing is

4519.36 --> 4524.88
is just like an ant bite

4522.8 --> 4528.0
compared to a sting of a hornet man

4524.88 --> 4528.0
that's just [ __ ]

4528.64 --> 4535.4400000000005
like people can get pretty severe

4531.92 --> 4535.4400000000005
reaction to a hornet bite

4536.239 --> 4540.48
like everyone in my family that's when

4538.56 --> 4541.280000000001
we got bit by hornet and we've been

4540.48 --> 4543.5199999999995
through it

4541.28 --> 4544.32
i've been like twice or something

4543.52 --> 4547.76
terrible

4544.32 --> 4549.84
terrible pain and like really

4547.76 --> 4550.96
really painful almost like a snake bite

4549.84 --> 4553.679
or something

4550.96 --> 4554.4800000000005
and and that would last it would last

4553.679 --> 4557.04
like an hour

4554.48 --> 4558.5599999999995
you would get all sore muscles really

4557.04 --> 4561.6
painful

4558.56 --> 4564.8
and yeah you you i got a fever from it

4561.6 --> 4566.56
like so

4564.8 --> 4569.04
bad stuff be careful with freaking

4566.56 --> 4569.04
hornets

4569.199 --> 4573.678999999999
but that's more for the subtropics and

4571.36 --> 4577.199
the tropical regions

4573.679 --> 4577.1990000000005
thank god they're not over here

4577.28 --> 4581.84
i hope it stays that way

4587.92 --> 4594.0
yeah me too here we go again hornets are

4590.159 --> 4595.679
just horrific

4594.0 --> 4598.08
the freaky thing is is that they're so

4595.679 --> 4599.1990000000005
sneaky like wasps are like you know when

4598.08 --> 4602.4
there's a wasp

4599.199 --> 4605.28
but a hornet you don't see them coming

4602.4 --> 4606.239
they're really sad it's uh yeah and when

4605.28 --> 4608.8
they sting you

4606.239 --> 4610.4
yeah then it's too late it it almost

4608.8 --> 4613.04
feels like you're being stabbed

4610.4 --> 4613.04
at that point

4620.08 --> 4624.159
yeah and we used to go to spain

4622.08 --> 4625.92
regularly and they would always go for

4624.159 --> 4626.719
the horses and the donkeys there it was

4625.92 --> 4629.84
really sad

4626.719 --> 4631.28
to see like

4629.84 --> 4634.08
at one point there was this donkey

4631.28 --> 4636.96
somewhere in the shade and he'd had like

4634.08 --> 4638.719
20 freaking hornets constantly biting

4636.96 --> 4640.96
away at him

4638.719 --> 4643.199
and then like me and my brother at one

4640.96 --> 4644.4
point just decided okay we [ __ ] hate

4643.199 --> 4646.4
harness and they're like

4644.4 --> 4648.0
very tough to kill you can smack them

4646.4 --> 4649.36
and they'll be they'll be stunned but

4648.0 --> 4650.08
then they'll just get back up they're

4649.36 --> 4653.36
like really

4650.08 --> 4655.679
armored so then we just like

4653.36 --> 4656.5599999999995
full force hit the freaking donkey with

4655.679 --> 4659.76
like a fl

4656.56 --> 4662.96
fly swatter to smash him and then

4659.76 --> 4664.2390000000005
with their heels just crush him and like

4662.96 --> 4667.44
the donkey was like

4664.239 --> 4669.28
yeah donkey wasn't like i'm being

4667.44 --> 4669.5199999999995
slapped no he knew what we were doing

4669.28 --> 4672.48
and

4669.52 --> 4675.280000000001
he was like oh [ __ ] yeah thanks man

4672.48 --> 4675.28
[ __ ] hornets

4677.679 --> 4683.4400000000005
petrol spray i don't know

4680.96 --> 4685.44
yeah look if you're gonna do that when

4683.44 --> 4688.5599999999995
they're like on a donkey or something

4685.44 --> 4692.879999999999
hornets make leave open wounds you know

4688.56 --> 4695.280000000001
so that yeah you gotta be careful

4692.88 --> 4695.28
anyway

4698.719 --> 4702.88
[ __ ] hornets yeah enough about that

4701.199 --> 4707.839999999999
don't want to talk about those

4702.88 --> 4707.84
messed up creatures

4718.84 --> 4721.84
so

4724.96 --> 4728.32
hmm right more colored yeah it is

4726.96 --> 4731.12
interesting isn't it

4728.32 --> 4732.84
although it did also exist before the

4731.12 --> 4736.08
internet you know

4732.84 --> 4739.12
because yeah it depends on

4736.08 --> 4740.159
what you do how you keep contact how you

4739.12 --> 4742.5599999999995
reach out but

4740.159 --> 4743.759999999999
for example my family when we went to

4742.56 --> 4746.0
spain

4743.76 --> 4748.4800000000005
on a yearly basis my especially my

4746.0 --> 4751.52
mother really wanted to go every year

4748.48 --> 4755.12
there were always the same families

4751.52 --> 4756.88
and then yeah even though it was only

4755.12 --> 4758.32
during the vacation time it would be

4756.88 --> 4761.4400000000005
very similar as this

4758.32 --> 4765.199
except face to face because we would be

4761.44 --> 4767.759999999999
like this just out of nowhere community

4765.199 --> 4768.719
that would form on the camping because

4767.76 --> 4770.320000000001
that's where we all

4768.719 --> 4772.64
got to know one another all the same

4770.32 --> 4774.5599999999995
families and even saw how kids grew up

4772.64 --> 4776.96
and got married and [ __ ] and

4774.56 --> 4778.080000000001
and then they became apart and yeah

4776.96 --> 4781.6
after my mother died

4778.08 --> 4782.96
it all stopped and like another guy also

4781.6 --> 4785.84
like his brother died in an

4782.96 --> 4786.159
accident there terrible so yeah yeah

4785.84 --> 4789.6
that

4786.159 --> 4791.759999999999
that disintegrated but when it was still

4789.6 --> 4794.719
there we were being yeah we had like a

4791.76 --> 4796.56
hundred people maybe 50 to 100 people

4794.719 --> 4798.8
and we all knew each other and we all

4796.56 --> 4801.04
kind of kept track of one another

4798.8 --> 4803.76
kept asking like what what are you about

4801.04 --> 4806.8
and what are you doing and

4803.76 --> 4810.719
we would be like this own self-formed

4806.8 --> 4813.28
little family with different opinions

4810.719 --> 4813.28
too you know

4815.52 --> 4820.0
like some of them were like really

4817.52 --> 4823.360000000001
catholic and some of them were

4820.0 --> 4827.04
really atheists and we were like

4823.36 --> 4830.32
yeah whatever liberals still like

4827.04 --> 4830.96
good version i hope that's how we came

4830.32 --> 4835.36
across

4830.96 --> 4837.6
now we were very nice and caring

4835.36 --> 4838.48
and yeah that was very similar to this

4837.6 --> 4840.719
you know

4838.48 --> 4841.678999999999
so even before the internet that that

4840.719 --> 4844.08
did happen

4841.679 --> 4845.36
there were opportunities to just it

4844.08 --> 4847.36
would just happen you'd

4845.36 --> 4849.12
meet each other and be like wow these

4847.36 --> 4852.159
are interesting people and it feels

4849.12 --> 4853.44
good and they like us and

4852.159 --> 4856.239
yeah and then you get a lot of

4853.44 --> 4858.839999999999
conversations you share food and

4856.239 --> 4860.638999999999
you exchange cooking and all that great

4858.84 --> 4862.88
stuff so that

4860.639 --> 4864.639
definitely did exist before the internet

4862.88 --> 4867.76
except yeah it's

4864.639 --> 4871.28
it's not as easily accessible of course

4867.76 --> 4871.280000000001
this is all way quicker

4872.159 --> 4875.839999999999
but then again we unfortunately you know

4874.0 --> 4877.199
we can't talk we can read from one

4875.84 --> 4878.719
another you can show each other's

4877.199 --> 4882.0
pictures

4878.719 --> 4885.36
you can't unfortunately exchange

4882.0 --> 4885.679
literal bites of food because that was

4885.36 --> 4887.839999999999
like

4885.679 --> 4891.6
extra awesome during that time is that

4887.84 --> 4891.6
they got to taste so many little things

4893.76 --> 4897.12
alright see you later agm

4897.92 --> 4903.84
i got 50 more minutes to go

4914.84 --> 4917.84
uh

4919.12 --> 4925.5289999999995
yeah but uh

4922.35 --> 4925.529
[Music]

4927.28 --> 4931.84
those were really interesting times for

4929.12 --> 4931.84
me

4938.08 --> 4941.679
it's it's always been kind of weird

4939.76 --> 4944.400000000001
because

4941.679 --> 4946.56
i have typically two sides you know in

4944.4 --> 4948.239
which i could compose myself even during

4946.56 --> 4951.679
that time and that is

4948.239 --> 4952.0
to basically isolate myself because i'm

4951.679 --> 4954.4800000000005
like

4952.0 --> 4956.0
really not into communicating with a

4954.48 --> 4958.0
whole lot of people or like i'm

4956.0 --> 4961.04
drawing things i'm drawing my computer

4958.0 --> 4963.04
game drawings which i did a lot

4961.04 --> 4965.6
did that all throughout my youth i was

4963.04 --> 4967.44
always drawing computer games

4965.6 --> 4969.280000000001
home i was playing computer games and

4967.44 --> 4972.32
then in the summer time

4969.28 --> 4972.96
i'd have like paper on me like squared

4972.32 --> 4976.5599999999995
paper

4972.96 --> 4980.2390000000005
grid paper and i then just like oh this

4976.56 --> 4982.639
is how i would make a game

4980.239 --> 4984.32
i did that so many times so many

4982.639 --> 4985.679
different games

4984.32 --> 4987.36
because i didn't have a game boy or

4985.679 --> 4989.28
anything i'm glad that i didn't

4987.36 --> 4991.04
because i really enjoyed the drawing a

4989.28 --> 4993.5199999999995
lot

4991.04 --> 4997.199
so i'm glad that i did that instead of

4993.52 --> 4997.1990000000005
just playing on a game boy or something

4997.36 --> 5002.719
it yeah it helped my creative thinking

4999.84 --> 5002.719
also a lot more

5006.4 --> 5009.839999999999
but yeah i did that or i would simply

5009.04 --> 5011.6
engage

5009.84 --> 5013.6
with everyone and then just try to

5011.6 --> 5015.4400000000005
represent

5013.6 --> 5016.8
represent my family and my ways of

5015.44 --> 5019.44
thinking and

5016.8 --> 5019.84
like explore other people too you know i

5019.44 --> 5022.32
was

5019.84 --> 5023.76
always very curious about like heavy

5022.32 --> 5026.0
things

5023.76 --> 5027.04
with like uncomfortable subjects as well

5026.0 --> 5030.32
like what

5027.04 --> 5030.32
do you think of this

5032.56 --> 5036.080000000001
so even back then i i would at times be

5035.36 --> 5039.28
kind of like

5036.08 --> 5039.92
so curious that i would risk uh nerving

5039.28 --> 5042.88
people

5039.92 --> 5044.8
with things and that's even when i was

5042.88 --> 5047.04
very young because i would always

5044.8 --> 5050.08
just i was so curious i would always go

5047.04 --> 5050.08
too far with things

5051.36 --> 5057.839999999999
not always but i had the tendency

5054.84 --> 5057.84
sometimes

5060.56 --> 5066.719
i'm glad i know to keep

5063.92 --> 5071.84
a good bordering situations with that

5066.719 --> 5071.84
don't go too far anymore

5074.48 --> 5078.4
brainwaves talk about the heatwaves

5082.84 --> 5085.84
sheesh

5096.32 --> 5099.84
what are you talking about

5121.84 --> 5129.1990000000005
huh well are you guys talking about like

5126.159 --> 5133.5199999999995
vacation falling in love as a kid

5129.199 --> 5133.5199999999995
cause i had a lot of that too trust me

5135.04 --> 5142.56
i did quite a lot of smooching in spain

5152.88 --> 5155.84
or what

5162.95 --> 5166.16
[Music]

5174.09 --> 5177.1990000000005
[Music]

5180.84 --> 5183.84
one

5197.84 --> 5202.2390000000005
afraid to fly we always went with the

5200.239 --> 5204.638999999999
car

5202.239 --> 5204.638999999999
serious

5206.239 --> 5214.799999999999
let's drive from the netherlands

5210.639 --> 5218.400000000001
through france into the north of spain

5214.8 --> 5220.639
northeast but it would take

5218.4 --> 5223.12
well either one singular day of like

5220.639 --> 5225.1990000000005
20-hour travel but that would completely

5223.12 --> 5226.88
exhaust my parents so we usually take

5225.199 --> 5228.879999999999
like

5226.88 --> 5231.84
we take two days and then we stay

5228.88 --> 5231.84
somewhere in france

5232.239 --> 5236.799999999999
but we always went for the car it was a

5234.0 --> 5240.08
lot cheaper i think

5236.8 --> 5240.8
and there was so much stuff that we

5240.08 --> 5243.5199999999995
always be

5240.8 --> 5245.12
taking back because yeah we my mother

5243.52 --> 5246.96
especially but

5245.12 --> 5248.4
i'm i'm kind of glad she did because i

5246.96 --> 5252.0
still have all that

5248.4 --> 5252.32
that works on my uh what is it you call

5252.0 --> 5257.92
it

5252.32 --> 5257.92
the all my dishes

5258.239 --> 5261.5199999999995
the works uh

5261.84 --> 5266.08
the plates and all that and bowls it's

5264.719 --> 5268.88
all still it's from there

5266.08 --> 5269.76
it's from spain from la biswan it's the

5268.88 --> 5271.76
villages

5269.76 --> 5274.2390000000005
where we all got that because it had

5271.76 --> 5277.360000000001
like this uh

5274.239 --> 5278.08
pottery old-fashioned pottery and i

5277.36 --> 5279.92
really

5278.08 --> 5281.92
love that sort of stuff but you have to

5279.92 --> 5284.4
be careful with it because it breaks

5281.92 --> 5286.4800000000005
much easier than things like porcelain

5284.4 --> 5290.48
and everything else

5286.48 --> 5293.28
but yeah going with the car

5290.48 --> 5294.5599999999995
we go there with the half an empty car

5293.28 --> 5296.719
with like a lots of

5294.56 --> 5298.0
dutch stuff that you couldn't get in

5296.719 --> 5300.32
spain

5298.0 --> 5301.36
and then at the end of vacation yeah

5300.32 --> 5303.92
we'd be

5301.36 --> 5306.799999999999
we'd gone through all of that and then

5303.92 --> 5309.36
we fill up the car with

5306.8 --> 5311.28
yeah with all the pottery and [ __ ] that

5309.36 --> 5313.679
we got

5311.28 --> 5315.5199999999995
man we had to throw so much away of them

5313.679 --> 5317.6
when my mother eventually died because

5315.52 --> 5320.0
we had like

5317.6 --> 5320.639
i don't know five cubic meters of that

5320.0 --> 5323.84
[ __ ]

5320.639 --> 5323.84
more probably more

5324.159 --> 5330.638999999999
i could only save one cubic meter

5327.6 --> 5330.639
i still have a lot

5335.6 --> 5339.84
but i i love it you know i would never

5338.48 --> 5342.718999999999
want to eat from a

5339.84 --> 5344.639
plastic plate and i don't really like

5342.719 --> 5347.84
porcelain that much

5344.639 --> 5351.92
i don't but i like like

5347.84 --> 5354.639
the terracotta style

5351.92 --> 5357.28
it's just it's old it's like very

5354.639 --> 5359.4400000000005
old-fashioned

5357.28 --> 5361.759999999999
and they all literally often bake that

5359.44 --> 5361.759999999999
[ __ ]

5363.199 --> 5366.5599999999995
yes topic of traffic in my rest at long

5365.36 --> 5368.639
show indeed yeah

5366.56 --> 5370.159000000001
i'm gonna be having long shows there all

5368.639 --> 5372.0
week because

5370.159 --> 5373.679
nathan doesn't have a computer so

5372.0 --> 5374.48
there's no flat earth debates and i kind

5373.679 --> 5377.52
of

5374.48 --> 5379.839999999999
vowed that i do double shifts until he's

5377.52 --> 5379.84
back

5380.08 --> 5396.88
and i do feel like it

5393.04 --> 5396.88
but it is hot here so

5397.04 --> 5402.4
how much longer you want a cigarette

5400.48 --> 5404.239
dude if you want a cigarette just go get

5402.4 --> 5406.159
us go take a cigarette

5404.239 --> 5409.759999999999
i think i'm going to be here for like

5406.159 --> 5409.759999999999
nine minutes or something next
