early on though

370.979 --> 375.32

why

378.66 --> 384.05

some trees behind the arch now because

412.02 --> 415.5
I'm freaking done with this [ __ ]

413.819 --> 416.6
webcam

415.5 --> 419.4
foreign

416.6 --> 421.68
part of the reason why I got so agitated

419.4 --> 426.62
yesterday also but overall I had a

421.68 --> 426.62
pretty rough evening and night just like

427.319 --> 433.44
got like this pain came over me

430.8 --> 435.90000000000003
like not in my organs or anything but

433.44 --> 438.96
like in the nerve

435.9 --> 444.17999999999995
Center the solar plexus

438.96 --> 449.78
and yeah it kept me up at night as well

444.18 --> 452.46
but despite that I feel decently rested

449.78 --> 454.85999999999996
and yeah I had a really good phone call

452.46 --> 457.69899999999996
with my dad right before this

454.86 --> 457.699
before the show

458.16 --> 463.579

460.38 --> 463.579
[Music]

467.58 --> 473.4
how much is a webcam anyway uh

471.24 --> 478.819
I think this one was like

473.4 --> 478.81899999999996
I'm not sure it was like 40 or 80 Euros

490.68 --> 493.22
foreign

504.64 --> 507.87

508.02 --> 513.199

40 euros or something

578.399 --> 583.58
well that's some really expensive ones

581.04 --> 583.5799999999999

1077.66 --> 1081.74
split the plastic apart to get it open

1080.12 --> 1086.3799999999999
yeah

1081.74 --> 1086.38
this is not designed to be repairable

1108.19 --> 1111.91
[Music]

1133.76 --> 1141.2
okay George Sanford cute yeah I I don't

1138.02 --> 1143.9
really care why why this is happening I

1141.2 --> 1147.2
just wanna move on

1143.9 --> 1150.5590000000002
and it's working now so right I'll let's

1147.2 --> 1154.039
not make this show about that you know

1150.559 --> 1156.46
right because it's not interesting to

1154.039 --> 1156.46
talk about

1161.84 --> 1167.299
this is not an Electronics

1164.84 --> 1171.22
repair shop

1167.299 --> 1171.22
stream if you know what I mean

1172.12 --> 1175.1599999999999
[Music]

1175.28 --> 1180.3999999999999
I might rather talk about things that I

1177.74 --> 1180.4
like to talk about

1187.1 --> 1193.6999999999998
like for example the basic formula

1191.12 --> 1197.12
for learning

1193.7 --> 1201.559
simulate emulate integrate

1197.12 --> 1203.84
I mean it's it's almost like corporatist

1201.559 --> 1206.84
such a simple formula I mean there might

1203.84 --> 1209.299
be corporations that use this in their

1206.84 --> 1211.1599999999999
in their courses and [ __ ] even

1209.299 --> 1213.08
I wouldn't be surprised because it's

1211.16 --> 1215.539
it's what it is

1213.08 --> 1217.039
start simulating

1215.539 --> 1219.919
right

1217.039 --> 1221.299
mental process figure out what it is how

1219.919 --> 1225.039
it's functioning

1221.299 --> 1228.2
and then once you get it already before

1225.039 --> 1230.6
but you should yeah simulation is really

1228.2 --> 1233.14
the testing phase you emulate so you try

1230.6 --> 1233.1399999999999
to actually

1233.9 --> 1239.179
foreign

1235.72 --> 1242.74
crawl in the skin of it whatever it is

1239.179 --> 1242.74
to yeah

1244.7 --> 1247.78
you enact it

1248.12 --> 1254.539
and then you integrate it whatever you

1251.12 --> 1256.76
need like if you become that

1254.539 --> 1258.62
you make it your way

1256.76 --> 1262.94
integrate

1258.62 --> 1264.08
happy New Year oh that's most welcome

1262.94 --> 1266.66
right

1264.08 --> 1269.0
because I talk about like simulations

1266.66 --> 1271.179
all the time like simulations in the

1269.0 --> 1271.179
mind

1271.46 --> 1276.559
but there is a difference between the

1273.74 --> 1279.94
word simulate and emulate

1276.559 --> 1279.94
anyway let me check my vehicle

1302.0 --> 1305.0
whoa

1305.679 --> 1312.0800000000002
holy [ __ ] Tony Whitcomb

1308.78 --> 1315.98
I did not expect that

1312.08 --> 1318.02
oh wow that's a that's quite the PayPal

1315.98 --> 1319.58
happy New Year indeed thank you my

1318.02 --> 1322.36

1329.9 --> 1337.6000000000001
thank you so much

1333.02 --> 1337.6
that's definitely very helpful

1341.24 --> 1343.96
come on

1347.179 --> 1353.299
I'm splitting it

1351.38 --> 1355.0390000000002
because I'm not

1353.299 --> 1357.5
transferring

1355.039 --> 1360.58
an amount over

1357.5 --> 1360.58
a hundred bucks

1361.159 --> 1364.2990000000002
in a single go

1366.919 --> 1371.8400000000001
but thank you so much man I mean that

1369.559 --> 1374.6589999999999
certainly

1371.84 --> 1375.4399999999998
changes some things for me on the short

1374.659 --> 1377.3600000000001
run

1375.44 --> 1379.3400000000001
poof

1377.36 --> 1382.1789999999999
I could buy a new web camera yeah

1379.34 --> 1382.1789999999999
technically could

1384.02 --> 1389.4189999999999
but

1386.48 --> 1392.0
it might just keep working

1389.419 --> 1394.4
because I kind of needed it for just

1392.0 --> 1396.74
general maintenance in the first

1394.4 --> 1400.039
instance

1396.74 --> 1402.6200000000001
now thankfully thanks to Christmas bonus

1400.039 --> 1404.36
from from my stepmother I got a whole

1402.62 --> 1407.1789999999999
bunch of supplements that are gonna over

1404.36 --> 1411.08
the year save me a lot of cost

1407.179 --> 1414.44
so but right I was already kind of like

1411.08 --> 1416.059
running into Financial issues

1414.44 --> 1418.3400000000001
for a bit

1416.059 --> 1421.039
because of yeah it's all increasing I

1418.34 --> 1424.1589999999999
mean the costs are increasing

1421.039 --> 1426.559
my rent's not going down

1424.159 --> 1428.72
unfortunately

1426.559 --> 1431.36
I mean the rest of the roommates are

1428.72 --> 1434.24
like getting really upset over that

1431.36 --> 1437.9799999999998
I'm just like yeah well can you figure

1434.24 --> 1437.98
out how to do it differently

1439.039 --> 1443.08
ah

1440.659 --> 1443.0800000000002
foreign

1443.86 --> 1449.7199999999998
but yeah maintenance has become more

1446.9 --> 1453.159
expensive and I really appreciate the

1449.72 --> 1456.08
large donation like that

1453.159 --> 1458.74
thank you Tony Whitcomb thanks for the

1456.08 --> 1458.74
continued support

[Music]

1466.179 --> 1470.3200000000002
oh how did that now happen

1474.919 --> 1477.76
it's good and you

1479.059 --> 1481.36
foreign

1481.9 --> 1487.4
so relieved that the cam is just working

1484.46 --> 1490.3400000000001
now normally but it did that yesterday

1487.4 --> 1492.6200000000001
too right it started up like really

1490.34 --> 1495.26
freaky and then eventually it stopped

1492.62 --> 1495.81
doing that it's like what the [ __ ] is

1495.26 --> 1499.28
that man

1495.81 --> 1501.62
[Music]

1499.28 --> 1504.559
still really about the wiring at such

1501.62 --> 1506.78
when it does it like that

1504.559 --> 1509.059
it's just so odd

1506.78 --> 1512.78
I mean if it was just the wiring it

1509.059 --> 1516.9189999999999
would be continually non-stop doing that

1512.78 --> 1523.1
because it only does it now at the start

1516.919 --> 1524.48
right right makes sense yeah yes no no

1523.1 --> 1525.6399999999999
no whatever

1524.48 --> 1529.4
great

1525.64 --> 1532.9
yeah okay

1529.4 --> 1532.9
let's not get too wind up

1543.559 --> 1548.48
right so yeah I've been trying to catch

1545.48 --> 1551.6200000000001
up on some Owen Benjamin

1548.48 --> 1551.6200000000001

cool

1599.0 --> 1603.76
well I guess that's very handy if you're

1601.279 --> 1605.57
into business

1603.76 --> 1608.7
good on you

1605.57 --> 1608.7
[Music]

1623.539 --> 1627.82
all right so let's see

1627.919 --> 1631.8200000000002
going on yesterday

1629.72 --> 1634.24
what

1631.82 --> 1634.24
uh

1640.539 --> 1644.799
that was not really a lot going on

1647.96 --> 1652.94
no except yeah of course Brian's still

1650.059 --> 1655.76
going after Bev

1652.94 --> 1658.159
you said seems to be very proficient at

1655.76 --> 1659.9
it

1658.159 --> 1662.0
a wrench

1659.9 --> 1664.0
here

1662.0 --> 1664.0
um

1664.279 --> 1668.5
well you probably lost it then

1675.02 --> 1679.7
but

1677.059 --> 1682.7
I I don't really recognize you

1679.7 --> 1685.22
well I recognize the name though

1682.7 --> 1688.0
or is this like another one of your

1685.22 --> 1688.0
accounts or something

1688.7 --> 1692.9
because yeah wrenches don't

1690.32 --> 1697.48
automatically transfer

1692.9 --> 1697.48
YouTube suck you suck okay

1713.11 --> 1716.32
[Music]

1718.22 --> 1721.059
let's see

1743.9 --> 1746.9
foreign

1750.08 --> 1753.08
s

1760.039 --> 1763.84
no I said I don't see you in there

1764.48 --> 1774.78
with another account

1766.75 --> 1774.78
[Music]

1775.039 --> 1780.94
you had to channel change your account

1778.279 --> 1780.94
okay

1782.36 --> 1785.9189999999999
so what was it then

1787.22 --> 1792.38
right but look

1789.679 --> 1794.6000000000001
I don't necessarily recognize you and

1792.38 --> 1797.2990000000002
yeah there's actually a rule don't ask

1794.6 --> 1800.299
for wrenches if you don't have any

1797.299 --> 1802.58
I hand them out at my discretion using

1800.299 --> 1804.46
my intuition

1802.58 --> 1808.58
so just

1804.46 --> 1810.799
my chat is not about getting that wrench

1808.58 --> 1813.08
it's not what it's about

1810.799 --> 1815.179
there's lots of people in there that

1813.08 --> 1817.46
don't get wrenches and they've been here

1815.179 --> 1820.539
for like years

1817.46 --> 1820.539
it's not how it works

1823.22 --> 1829.34
[Music]

1826.76 --> 1833.6589999999999
what time do you start your New Year's

1829.34 --> 1835.76
Eve stream uh well after 12 so that's

1833.659 --> 1838.5390000000002
probably gonna be like a half hour past

1835.76 --> 1838.539
12 or something

1842.919 --> 1846.64
which would be

1850.159 --> 1853.1200000000001
went there

1853.58 --> 1856.4189999999999
right

1858.38 --> 1865.6000000000001
so what's three so that would be like

1862.76 --> 1865.6
nine hours

1867.38 --> 1870.5200000000002
like roughly nine and a half hours from

1869.659 --> 1874.46
now

1870.52 --> 1874.46
[Music]

1876.14 --> 1881.44
like right before no

1878.899 --> 1881.4399999999998
foreign

1887.38 --> 1893.419
did I do that last year I don't remember

1890.419 --> 1896.96
I'll probably just kind of look up

1893.419 --> 1899.0590000000002
the New Year's Eve streams

1896.96 --> 1902.14
from last year how I did it then but I

1899.059 --> 1902.1399999999999
thought that I because

1904.58 --> 1908.799
yeah I don't like do the countdown thing

1912.14 --> 1915.5800000000002
I think it's kind of silly

1916.7 --> 1922.3400000000001
I just kind of like get you in there

1918.86 --> 1924.3799999999999
like hello I got a beer and probably a

1922.34 --> 1926.33
joint or something and just fireworks

1924.38 --> 1929.66
outside right that's what it's about

1926.33 --> 1929.6599999999999
[Music]

1936.82 --> 1944.6
geometric green shapes

1939.62 --> 1946.6399999999999
huh no five roads I do know that if I

1944.6 --> 1950.12
would press like on the certain nerve

1946.64 --> 1951.14
with my eyes that what I get to see is

1950.12 --> 1954.9189999999999
like

1951.14 --> 1957.5590000000002
blue and black waves

1954.919 --> 1960.679
like this blue black blue black blue

1957.559 --> 1963.26
black and then it just took more that

1960.679 --> 1965.0590000000002
kind of effect but that's like clearly

1963.26 --> 1966.6
blue not green so I don't know what

1965.059 --> 1968.62
you're talking about

1966.6 --> 1972.2199999999998

1985.48 --> 1991.419
so you think you might be slightly

1988.399 --> 1991.4189999999999
hallucinating then

1993.44 --> 1997.419
that's

2112.119 --> 2117.94
I don't really focus on that

2114.599 --> 2121.1800000000003
because focusing on such things for me

2117.94 --> 2125.68
actually distracts me from looking into

2121.18 --> 2128.46
my mind like the virtual creation

2125.68 --> 2131.68
foreign

2128.46 --> 2133.839
with that sort of thinking I don't

2131.68 --> 2135.7
really

2133.839 --> 2138.04
do that anymore like I don't allow

don't know what it has to do with ball

I wanted to roll out but yeah now the

2241.18 --> 2247.06
the energy is gone

2244.48 --> 2249.7
oh I I did put it down basically it's to

2247.06 --> 2251.2799999999997
simulate emulate integrate

2251.28 --> 2256.26

2275.74 --> 2280.14
recently

2276.94 --> 2280.14
looked into it again

2281.98 --> 2285.82
and then I remembered oh I've already

2284.079 --> 2289.119
read that

2285.82 --> 2294.06
or maybe not personally read it had

2289.119 --> 2294.06
somebody like read it out to me

2294.88 --> 2300.04
but it is really about like just well

2298.24 --> 2301.66
Ayahuasca and stuff and like what it's

2300.04 --> 2304.42
like

2301.66 --> 2306.46
and the weird how the subconscious calls

2304.42 --> 2309.839
and all that it's very

2306.46 --> 2309.839
spiritual like that

2312.339 --> 2315.96
that's what you're talking about right

2335.4 --> 2340.859
but you got to be careful with that [ __ ]

2338.079 --> 2340.8590000000004
man I mean

2341.579 --> 2346.599
hallucinogenics like that it might seem

2344.32 --> 2349.7200000000003
all super exciting but there's like this

2346.599 --> 2353.32
real big weight to it and if you just

2349.72 --> 2356.14
start to try to shove that stuff in

2353.32 --> 2359.8
just for an experience to get some

2356.14 --> 2362.44
inspiration it's gonna [ __ ] you up

2359.8 --> 2365.26
more and more and more

2362.44 --> 2368.619
cause you gotta go in with a mission

2365.26 --> 2371.44

2371.44 --> 2377.8
what that really backfires

2374.68 --> 2380.0789999999997
because that's not a proper mission

2377.8 --> 2381.7000000000003
you're abusing something that's meant

2380.079 --> 2385.0
for your spirit

2381.7 --> 2387.96
for Earthly gains then

2385.0 --> 2387.96
don't do that

2405.4 --> 2411.64
right hey unless you're like oh man but

2409.06 --> 2415.24
yeah I'm ready I'm ready to take on 80

2411.64 --> 2417.52
years of nightmare of hell

2415.24 --> 2418.8999999999996
oh yeah

2417.52 --> 2421.48
right

2418.9 --> 2425.44
hey if it keeps calling you yeah then

2421.48 --> 2428.619
eventually you really can't help it

2425.44 --> 2433.359
but you should consider that that could

2428.619 --> 2436.0
be viewed as a call of Dionysus

2433.359 --> 2439.3199999999997
who takes a piece a year

2436.0 --> 2439.32

2444.579 --> 2450.52

2448.3 --> 2452.44
draw you to that

2530.46 --> 2535.42
be careful not to catch a cold with that

2533.079 --> 2537.94
kind of dramatic temperature change that

2535.42 --> 2539.14
could typically happen

2537.94 --> 2541.599
hmm

2539.14 --> 2544.2999999999997
anyway kind of nice to be out of that

[Music]

2610.66 --> 2613.2599999999998

2626.44 --> 2630.64
because there's like this tricky thing

2628.9 --> 2633.4
about dreaming

2630.64 --> 2634.66
if you realize it you snap out of it

2633.4 --> 2636.819
it's like

2634.66 --> 2638.859
the dream is like as is like a

2636.819 --> 2641.02
simulation internally

2638.859 --> 2643.5989999999997
and if you

2641.02 --> 2647.38
like become conscious of it

2643.599 --> 2649.42
then you almost like connect and thereby

2647.38 --> 2653.6800000000003
neutralize it

2649.42 --> 2656.7000000000003
so to then use in like a disciplinary

2653.68 --> 2659.74
distraction like oh focus on your hands

2656.7 --> 2662.2
will basically prevent your

2659.74 --> 2664.5989999999997
Consciousness from integrating with the

2662.2 --> 2666.819
simulation and thereby negating it so

2664.599 --> 2668.8590000000004
that you can from the perspective of

2666.819 --> 2671.16
focusing on your hands describe what's

2668.859 --> 2673.2
around it

2671.16 --> 2675.46
without

2673.2 --> 2677.9199999999996
dissoluting it

right

2677.92 --> 2679.98
now

2685.06 --> 2693.2999999999997
told not to venture out very far

well fiber oats

2811.119 --> 2817.1800000000003
it's potentially dangerous

2813.94 --> 2819.54
if it's really dangerous you'll feel

2817.18 --> 2819.54
that

2820.78 --> 2827.38
right you just just don't think of your

2824.92 --> 2830.44
dreams and [ __ ] like it's

2827.38 --> 2832.7200000000003
it's some kind of entertainment

2830.44 --> 2834.28
when something really dark comes by I

2832.72 --> 2836.56
mean if something that well you probably

2834.28 --> 2839.88
wouldn't have do that anyway because the

2836.56 --> 2839.88
Instinct will just warn you

2839.92 --> 2845.8
and what basically means something

2842.38 --> 2848.56
dangerous can be in that place is

2845.8 --> 2851.1400000000003
it is possible that that could happen it

2848.56 --> 2854.2599999999998
doesn't mean that it always happens

2851.14 --> 2856.5
but you should be aware that it can

2854.26 --> 2856.5
happen

2857.2 --> 2861.0989999999997
right depending on the moment depending

2859.42 --> 2861.9
on what energies are going around all

item for yourself

2881.02 --> 2886.839
I I don't

2883.24 --> 2889.7799999999997
yeah well I just don't try to actually

2886.839 --> 2892.9
actively remember anything anymore I

2889.78 --> 2894.579
mean if I meant to remember it I I will

2892.9 --> 2897.819
carry that dream

2894.579 --> 2901.2400000000002
right this is interesting also like with

2897.819 --> 2905.859
my show set up because I I didn't wake

2901.24 --> 2909.2799999999997
up too like maximum like two three hours

2905.859 --> 2911.619
before I start the show every time

2909.28 --> 2914.5
and

2911.619 --> 2916.2400000000002
I can still like carry the essence of

2914.5 --> 2919.3
the dream that I had

2916.24 --> 2921.64
to bolster me to strengthen me even

2919.3 --> 2923.6800000000003
though I actively don't understand what

2921.64 --> 2926.7999999999997
it even

2923.68 --> 2929.6189999999997
is it's just an energy that can like

2926.8 --> 2931.78
yeah I'll carry that energy forth from

2929.619 --> 2934.119
my dream even though I don't even

2931.78 --> 2935.619
address it it's just there

2934.119 --> 2940.02
and I can

2935.619 --> 2940.02
maintain it I like I don't discard

2942.06 --> 2948.46
right I might get distracted the way if

2945.22 --> 2951.2799999999997
something happens after I wake up

2948.46 --> 2953.5
but if nothing particular happens I'll

2951.28 --> 2956.28
literally just carry forth the energy

2953.5 --> 2956.28
from the dream

2957.46 --> 2961.079
even without addressing it

2962.98 --> 2965.22
right

2967.24 --> 2971.3799999999997
right

2968.56 --> 2974.98
confidence carrier right

2971.38 --> 2977.5
because I do I mean in my dreams there

2974.98 --> 2980.319
they tend to

2977.5 --> 2982.24
be glorious a lot of the time in a

2980.319 --> 2985.3
relatively modest way

2982.24 --> 2987.7
but I feel like very good and strong in

2985.3 --> 2989.5600000000004
there often

2987.7 --> 2993.52
like because I don't have the Earthly

2989.56 --> 2996.7
burdens and it's like a real relief

2993.52 --> 2998.6
and then I can carry some of that relief

2996.7 --> 3000.6189999999997
and energy forth

buggy yeah

3018.68 --> 3024.4199999999996
well it's like if you do that what can

3022.5 --> 3028.38
happen is that like your dreams almost

3024.42 --> 3029.0
become like an entity a

3028.38 --> 3032.28
a

3029.0 --> 3035.22
compartmentalized entity that is you

3032.28 --> 3036.599
but that becomes aware that it's been

3035.22 --> 3040.2599999999998
spotted

3036.599 --> 3041.6400000000003
almost like a pet that suddenly gets

3040.26 --> 3043.3190000000004
attention

3041.64 --> 3045.1189999999997
it's like oh

3043.319 --> 3049.619
oh

3045.119 --> 3051.3
so so you finally recognize I'm here now

3049.619 --> 3052.7400000000002
and then they

3051.3 --> 3055.8590000000004
yeah

3052.74 --> 3058.5789999999997
then they give you more and more but can

3055.859 --> 3058.5789999999997
be a bit much

3068.64 --> 3072.2999999999997
wow

3070.319 --> 3075.0
become aware that you're dreaming you

3072.3 --> 3078.6600000000003
start flying that's what I do

3075.0 --> 3080.94
because I'm very good at playing

3078.66 --> 3082.5
I can I've even like

3080.94 --> 3085.559
withheld

3082.5 --> 3089.04
in my dreams

3085.559 --> 3089.94
information about that I knew it was a

3089.04 --> 3094.5
dream

3089.94 --> 3098.18
towards characters in my dream

3094.5 --> 3101.88
now that's a freaking Wizardry

3098.18 --> 3103.7999999999997
so I would like play them

3101.88 --> 3106.88
freaked them out a little

3103.8 --> 3106.88
but just a little

3107.339 --> 3110.88
because they didn't understand it was

3109.38 --> 3113.46
only a dream

3110.88 --> 3117.389
but I did

3113.46 --> 3117.389
[Music]

3124.26 --> 3128.76
but yeah flying is like the default

3126.54 --> 3130.17
testability I mean if I can fly then I

3128.76 --> 3131.76
know okay it's a dream

3130.17 --> 3134.4
[Music]

3131.76 --> 3136.38
and it's it's like I can do it like

3134.4 --> 3137.54
almost like Darth Vader 4 style I can

3136.38 --> 3140.88
just like

3137.54 --> 3143.52
just do this and I will literally just

3140.88 --> 3145.26
cause myself to this place I could I can

3143.52 --> 3148.98
literally in my dream just make myself

3145.26 --> 3151.3190000000004
Levitate by just tensing up my hand one

3148.98 --> 3153.839
hand I don't even have to use the rest

3151.319 --> 3156.319
if there is enough strength because

3153.839 --> 3159.42
there is like this strength energy

3156.319 --> 3162.7799999999997
specifically that allows that

3159.42 --> 3164.7000000000003
or you can't reach it and then it just

3162.78 --> 3167.1600000000003
doesn't you have to like put so much

3164.7 --> 3169.14
energy into it it barely works but the

3167.16 --> 3171.359
potential is always there

3169.14 --> 3172.98
I mean flying is like a real standard

3171.359 --> 3175.68
ability

3172.98 --> 3178.2
has been since my earliest memories of

3175.68 --> 3180.96
dreams like when I was five I still have

3178.2 --> 3181.98
this really elaborate memory of that

3180.96 --> 3185.3
dream

3181.98 --> 3185.3
what it was like

3187.619 --> 3191.6400000000003
that's because it was specifically about

3189.78 --> 3194.0
flying and it was like with my brother

3191.64 --> 3194.0
there

3197.46 --> 3204.559
was like a family dream with flying and

3200.22 --> 3204.5589999999997
that was that's just kind of interesting

3205.74 --> 3209.8799999999997
never forget

3207.78 --> 3214.3190000000004
because we like it's like okay we're

3209.88 --> 3217.98
sort of like on a in a place

3214.319 --> 3218.94
in the open uh like on a field or

3217.98 --> 3220.98
something

3218.94 --> 3224.099
and it's just like yeah start running

3220.98 --> 3227.22
and then lift off

3224.099 --> 3229.44
and then we like fly over like a a lake

3227.22 --> 3231.18
or something and then land on the other

3229.44 --> 3233.7000000000003
side but it was

3231.18 --> 3239.4199999999996
like a slightly rough Landing we had

3233.7 --> 3239.4199999999996
trouble stopping the horizontal movement

3239.579 --> 3243.2000000000003
I dreamed that when I was five

3244.5 --> 3252.059
now when I dream and I'm flying I am

3248.579 --> 3254.7000000000003
like Neo I'm like absolutely the master

3252.059 --> 3256.6800000000003
of light I can do things that are crazy

3254.7 --> 3260.0989999999997
I can like

3256.68 --> 3261.7799999999997
make myself float against the ceiling I

3260.099 --> 3264.54
can hover

3261.78 --> 3268.079
two inches off the ground and like

3264.54 --> 3269.7
almost like a skateboard like speed down

3268.079 --> 3272.42
a road

3269.7 --> 3275.04
it's crazy what I can do with the flight

3272.42 --> 3278.88
and a lot of fun

3275.04 --> 3281.22
thank God I don't actually get hurt

3278.88 --> 3283.1400000000003
because that would suck it would be very

3281.22 --> 3285.54
risky if that were real

3283.14 --> 3289.14
I mean you're not just gonna float two

3285.54 --> 3290.64
inches off a actual Road just like oh

3289.14 --> 3293.64
dude I could do it because like one

3290.64 --> 3296.52
moment you're off and ah [ __ ] did I just

3293.64 --> 3297.66
almost stab my freaking eye out

3296.52 --> 3301.339
[ __ ]

3297.66 --> 3301.339
well that could happen I

3303.42 --> 3306.079
[ __ ]

3321.92 --> 3327.4500000000003
okay thank God that was only in the skin

3326.099 --> 3329.059
man

3327.45 --> 3331.859
[Music]

3329.059 --> 3334.69
just half a centimeter down and it

3331.859 --> 3338.339
probably would have poked my eye out

3334.69 --> 3341.0
[Music]

3338.339 --> 3341.0
anyway

3345.78 --> 3349.8
I would always have to navigate around

3347.64 --> 3352.44
telephone lines

3349.8 --> 3354.059
well slow-mo movement once I got going

3352.44 --> 3356.46
with my flight

3354.059 --> 3358.7400000000002
I could literally just turn myself into

3356.46 --> 3360.66
the wind

3358.74 --> 3363.2999999999997
like once I really get off the ground

3360.66 --> 3366.42
it's like I can turn into the wind and

3363.3 --> 3370.94
literally just like just

3366.42 --> 3370.94
slip through things like the wind

3371.72 --> 3378.359
as long as there's literally like enough

3375.0 --> 3381.0
physical room for me to worm through it

3378.359 --> 3382.02
it's like a worm digging through the

3381.0 --> 3385.859
ground

3382.02 --> 3389.66
I can fly like that so I never like bash

3385.859 --> 3389.66
into anything that's never happened

3391.44 --> 3394.44
foreign

3408.24 --> 3413.22
but it's also because in a way and I was

3410.88 --> 3417.9
I like flying I'm very curious at it and

3413.22 --> 3420.5989999999997
I just I've studied my flight abilities

3417.9 --> 3422.099
it's almost like a little experiment I

3420.599 --> 3424.6400000000003
just do

3422.099 --> 3427.7400000000002
foreign

3424.64 --> 3429.66
that comes up

3427.74 --> 3431.3999999999996
I always like testing like hey where

3429.66 --> 3433.8799999999997
what can I do how is this actually

3431.4 --> 3433.88
working

3434.46 --> 3441.26

3438.359 --> 3441.2599999999998
very far

3441.66 --> 3446.52
it's like I've gotten so good at it that

3444.3 --> 3448.5
at this point it's like a little

3446.52 --> 3450.359
disappointing that I can't ever do

3448.5 --> 3453.17
anything with that in the physical world

3450.359 --> 3456.0
because I'm so freaking good at it

3453.17 --> 3458.7000000000003
[Music]

3456.0 --> 3461.66
and it would be extremely convenient

3458.7 --> 3461.66

3483.059 --> 3489.92
you talking about Luna loves you

is

3526.76 --> 3532.6800000000003
I think I'm gonna change the title

3530.16 --> 3534.5989999999997
that magic of life but the magic of

about

3539.819 --> 3544.339

3540.96 --> 3544.339

that's a pretty hefty wind all of a

3562.799 --> 3564.98

3782.46 --> 3785.52
tonight

3783.54 --> 3788.66
there's probably not gonna be as much

[Music]

3812.88 --> 3815.88

3832.079 --> 3836.04
by the way LSG that's an interesting

3834.359 --> 3838.5589999999997
type of dream but

3836.04 --> 3842.94
you can actually test that because

3838.559 --> 3844.8590000000004
sometimes it does happen sometimes

3842.94 --> 3848.78
somebody dreamed something and then

3844.859 --> 3848.7799999999997
other people dream about it too

3849.299 --> 3851.9

3853.02 --> 3856.339
that's very tricky

3860.52 --> 3867.559
if you get like weird magic [ __ ]

3863.04 --> 3867.5589999999997
involved then it gets even more extreme

3871.02 --> 3875.7
can also basically like create a shared

3874.26 --> 3879.119
portal

3875.7 --> 3882.839
in the sense that you share you can

3879.119 --> 3885.0
connect up and then share a dream space

3882.839 --> 3886.68
where you can literally contact each

3885.0 --> 3889.28
other almost like the internet except

3886.68 --> 3889.2799999999997
it's a dream

3889.74 --> 3895.02
I'm very certain that that's possible

3891.96 --> 3897.799
because it was a part of my Dark World

3895.02 --> 3897.799
experiences

3898.4 --> 3903.599
people in the real world did seem to

3901.619 --> 3906.48
actually remember things that happened

3903.599 --> 3909.7400000000002
in those dreams that were discussed not

3906.48 --> 3909.7400000000002
in the physical real world

3913.14 --> 3915.74
yeah

3915.839 --> 3921.42
foreign

3918.26 --> 3923.4
can you know I don't care to try that

3921.42 --> 3926.04
again

3923.4 --> 3929.6600000000003
particular individuals I had that with

3926.04 --> 3929.66
are extremely unpleasant

3931.44 --> 3935.599
except for my mother who's dead

3940.02 --> 3945.599
would that imply connectivity it implies

3942.24 --> 3948.299
that you can potentially under

3945.599 --> 3950.579
difficult to master circumstances can

3948.299 --> 3954.619
connect up with other people in your

3950.579 --> 3954.619
dreams through your dreams

3960.299 --> 3966.24
but it's like if it's not friends you're

3964.2 --> 3969.5989999999997
like particularly close within that

3966.24 --> 3971.22
moment then it's very tough to integrate

3969.599 --> 3974.28
because

3971.22 --> 3977.3999999999996
you mismatch you'll just not connect

write it out

say

4196.64 --> 4202.1

this better way of communicating don't

4209.36 --> 4213.82

4300.92 --> 4305.719
got a half an hour

4302.659 --> 4308.0199999999995
any more questions about dreams how they

4305.719 --> 4308.02
work

4308.36 --> 4311.739
what you can do

4317.06 --> 4322.280000000001
how you can

4318.8 --> 4325.179
sometimes connect up in dreams seemingly

4322.28 --> 4325.179
coincidental

4329.42 --> 4335.54
but there is a reason how that happens I

4332.239 --> 4338.36
think because every time that happens to

4335.54 --> 4341.0199999999995
me there's always an unexpected like

4338.36 --> 4341.0199999999995
foreign

4341.38 --> 4348.08
I don't know if you guys ever noticed

4344.78 --> 4350.48
it's like the same effect as when you

4348.08 --> 4353.9
fall in love or something but not that

4350.48 --> 4355.0
you get overwhelmed by that but like the

4353.9 --> 4357.5
same

4355.0 --> 4359.48
circumstantial glimmer there's like this

4357.5 --> 4361.58
magic

4359.48 --> 4365.299999999999
right the magic of Love well there's

4361.58 --> 4367.28
actually actual energy stuff happening

4365.3 --> 4370.1
when that happens

4367.28 --> 4371.239
somebody really falls in love

4370.1 --> 4374.179
foreign

4371.239 --> 4375.919999999999
and when you connect up in dreams it's

4374.179 --> 4378.56
almost like

4375.92 --> 4381.9800000000005
a sort of

4378.56 --> 4385.4800000000005
just a spiritual bond that then just

4381.98 --> 4385.48
manifests within the dream

4389.3 --> 4395.179
can you move things

4393.14 --> 4397.219
what

4395.179 --> 4399.76
in the dream you mean

4397.219 --> 4399.76
sure

4402.26 --> 4408.88
if it's really necessary but

4404.5 --> 4408.88
usually I don't do that

4410.0 --> 4414.92
I'm the one I can move most of the time

4412.34 --> 4418.719
that's the easiest I can move myself

4414.92 --> 4418.719
very easily in any way I like

4426.92 --> 4433.179
but also because in dreams objects

4429.86 --> 4433.179
aren't always what they see

4433.58 --> 4438.92
because it's a simulation

4436.04 --> 4441.26
and that starts to like Express itself

4438.92 --> 4445.12
stops to become noticeable when you

4441.26 --> 4445.12
actually start to move around things

4446.719 --> 4449.9800000000005
right what you might think is a bushel

4448.64 --> 4452.84
and a tree

4449.98 --> 4455.839999999999
next to a house might actually just not

4452.84 --> 4458.02
literally be that it just appears like

4455.84 --> 4458.02
that

4458.239 --> 4464.299999999999
but once you start to actually well

4461.56 --> 4466.1
simulatorily physically interact with it

4464.3 --> 4468.4400000000005
then suddenly it's like wait no it

4466.1 --> 4471.34
doesn't it's not actually that it just

4468.44 --> 4471.339999999999
resembles it

4474.56 --> 4480.52
thank you

4476.06 --> 4480.52
can move other things oh good in you

4488.14 --> 4494.26
I can create a Vortex that literally

4491.06 --> 4494.26
rips everything apart

4495.15 --> 4498.37
[Music]

4498.739 --> 4502.54
sometimes it happens by accident

4505.239 --> 4512.259999999999
especially when I'm like high tension

4509.06 --> 4512.26
in the waking world

4513.98 --> 4519.0199999999995
trying to read text or maps in your

4516.32 --> 4521.38
dream is incredibly frustrating yeah

4519.02 --> 4525.02
often is but it's also because it just

4521.38 --> 4526.6990000000005
resembles a map or a text it isn't

4525.02 --> 4528.92
actually that

4526.699 --> 4531.5599999999995
it's just your mind is making it your

4528.92 --> 4534.08
mind is telling you this is a map but it

4531.56 --> 4536.900000000001
hasn't actually gotten any in content

4534.08 --> 4538.94
details so it's just like it's appearing

4536.9 --> 4540.92
to you like a map but you just can't

4538.94 --> 4543.08
find anything well what is this yeah

4540.92 --> 4546.219
it's because it's not actually a map it

4543.08 --> 4546.219
just resembles it

4547.88 --> 4552.679
everything in your mind that you create

4550.28 --> 4557.8
in your dream mostly just is there to

4552.679 --> 4557.8
resemble things within a context

4559.64 --> 4566.0
your mind in your dream often isn't as

4562.88 --> 4566.96
meticulous as like a hollow deck on Star

4566.0 --> 4569.96
Trek

4566.96 --> 4572.96
right or it's really is a perfect

4569.96 --> 4575.84
emulation of an object thingy or no no

4572.96 --> 4578.78
it's just there to resemble

4575.84 --> 4581.78
because the context is the guiding force

4578.78 --> 4583.219
in any dream

4581.78 --> 4586.699
right

4583.219 --> 4589.4
the reason why these things why that

4586.699 --> 4592.759999999999
confrontation why the reminder that's

4589.4 --> 4595.159
the leading force not whether the

4592.76 --> 4596.83
simulation is correct according to

4595.159 --> 4600.159
Earthly standards

4617.36 --> 4622.699
right I don't need I never read things

4620.659 --> 4624.799999999999
I think I might be like extremely

4622.699 --> 4626.599999999999
dyslexic in my dreams

4624.8 --> 4629.54
I just don't read

4626.6 --> 4631.280000000001
maybe a name I might recognize a name if

4629.54 --> 4633.94
it is a name because if it's not a name

4631.28 --> 4636.679
I I can't read it

4633.94 --> 4639.759999999999
if it's a name I can't read

4636.679 --> 4639.76
isn't that interesting

4643.64 --> 4650.2390000000005
Maps though I can and that's very

4646.88 --> 4653.78
fascinating because I've seen a map

4650.239 --> 4657.379999999999
that is like haunted my dreams

4653.78 --> 4659.54
in the sense that where is this map when

4657.38 --> 4662.96
am I gonna finally face that map because

4659.54 --> 4666.5
it was like a map of the world

4662.96 --> 4669.199
that was like 20 times as large

4666.5 --> 4671.84
and it had like gigantic continents

4669.199 --> 4673.879999999999
which I still roughly remember the shape

4671.84 --> 4676.28
about but it was so scattered all over

4673.88 --> 4679.9400000000005
the place that's just like

4676.28 --> 4683.0599999999995
it just looked like this is too big

4679.94 --> 4686.36
and it is it looks it could be real like

4683.06 --> 4688.9400000000005
are there gigantic continents

4686.36 --> 4691.04
those are like bigger than Asia out

4688.94 --> 4694.0
there

4691.04 --> 4694.0
that we just

4695.179 --> 4700.58
we don't even know what kind of life is

4697.82 --> 4703.34
there I don't know and this is by the

4700.58 --> 4705.5
way very far before Flat Earth Awakening

4703.34 --> 4708.9400000000005
so I haven't been drenched in maps yet

4705.5 --> 4708.94
and all that right

4710.0 --> 4715.52
like much younger around 17 I guess

4713.659 --> 4717.739
around that time

4715.52 --> 4719.780000000001
still remember just that map it's like

4717.739 --> 4722.299999999999
oh here you've got

4719.78 --> 4724.639999999999
we really got the Earth's continents and

4722.3 --> 4727.1
then you got that other gigantic

4724.64 --> 4729.7390000000005
continent and then other stuff and

4727.1 --> 4732.38
Islands there and there and just another

4729.739 --> 4734.839999999999
gigantic continent even further to the

4732.38 --> 4736.58
South and it's just like whoa

4734.84 --> 4739.159000000001
I was just staring at this map but

4736.58 --> 4742.76
trying to figure out where is this where

4739.159 --> 4743.7699999999995
is this why I've never seen this before

4742.76 --> 4745.219
ah

4743.77 --> 4747.64
[Music]

4745.219 --> 4750.44
got me really fascinated like like

4747.64 --> 4753.5
obsessed fascinated like I wanted to

4750.44 --> 4756.5
keep seeing that map in my dreams every

4753.5 --> 4757.88
time for a long time because I wanted to

4756.5 --> 4760.46
know if there was any kind of

4757.88 --> 4763.82
recognition or to even figure out

4760.46 --> 4766.699
whether it is something that I created

4763.82 --> 4768.86
or that it was a real map

4766.699 --> 4771.08
that would not change because it kept

4768.86 --> 4773.179
looking the same didn't just keep

4771.08 --> 4775.659
changing or anything it was like that's

4773.179 --> 4775.659
the map

4776.6 --> 4781.96
whatever it was

4779.36 --> 4781.96
hmm

4784.83 --> 4789.5289999999995
[Music]

4791.36 --> 4798.739
sex just too realistic in dreams

4795.199 --> 4800.78
more realistic than in real life

4798.739 --> 4801.98
I disagree on that

4800.78 --> 4804.92
but

4801.98 --> 4808.699
yeah when your nerve centers get

4804.92 --> 4811.64
stimulated like in sexual dreams

4808.699 --> 4814.5199999999995
you're basically at your most vulnerable

4811.64 --> 4817.04
so it tends to be more

4814.52 --> 4819.5
intimate as an experience for yourself

4817.04 --> 4821.42
because you are perfectly relaxed when

4819.5 --> 4824.3
that happens and

4821.42 --> 4827.0
yeah all those same energy processes

4824.3 --> 4829.34
still happen so it's much more it can

4827.0 --> 4833.0
often be like perceived as more real

4829.34 --> 4835.1
than real unless you're a real

4833.0 --> 4837.199
yeah unless you're really serious about

4835.1 --> 4840.320000000001
your sex

4837.199 --> 4841.699
and you really put a lot of

4840.32 --> 4843.98
effort

4841.699 --> 4845.178999999999
and energy into it and know what you're

4843.98 --> 4848.239
doing

4845.179 --> 4851.14
and then the dream really can't compare

4848.239 --> 4851.139999999999
to the real thing

4851.239 --> 4856.82
but if you're slightly clumsy with sex

4853.78 --> 4857.659
for some reason you just like the senses

4856.82 --> 4859.46
don't

4857.659 --> 4861.259999999999
fire up as much

4859.46 --> 4864.32
then yeah in your dream it can be more

4861.26 --> 4868.54
intense because you are completely

4864.32 --> 4868.54
vulnerable when that happens

4871.52 --> 4874.42
anyway

4883.28 --> 4888.259999999999
at those dreams where you realize you

4885.8 --> 4890.900000000001
were only dreaming yeah dude I've had

4888.26 --> 4893.84
terrible terrible dreams about people

4890.9 --> 4896.5
corrupting

4893.84 --> 4899.4800000000005
or losing the will to live and [ __ ]

4896.5 --> 4902.36
horrifying dreams

4899.48 --> 4904.879999999999
of like good people that you really love

4902.36 --> 4906.32
that suddenly like lose the will and

4904.88 --> 4909.62
live and there's nothing you can do to

4906.32 --> 4911.659
stop it that's horrific

4909.62 --> 4915.46
thankfully like that's never actually

4911.659 --> 4915.46
manifested in any kind of way

4915.739 --> 4920.959999999999
weirdly enough I had like the opposite

4917.719 --> 4924.26
type of dream with my with my nephew who

4920.96 --> 4926.42
did actually commit suicide like a long

4924.26 --> 4928.400000000001
time ago

4926.42 --> 4932.679
I had dreams

4928.4 --> 4932.679
where he just didn't have that

4933.04 --> 4938.92
like he had like severe depression and

4936.679 --> 4938.92
[ __ ]

4939.08 --> 4943.46
but

4940.46 --> 4945.56
in my dream simulation of him because I

4943.46 --> 4948.14
did dream about him a lot I like I

4945.56 --> 4950.3
looked up at him in ways it's a very

4948.14 --> 4952.04
interesting guy

4950.3 --> 4954.8
very inspired

4952.04 --> 4957.86
bit like Kanye West

4954.8 --> 4960.1990000000005
streak of inspiration type guy he was

4957.86 --> 4962.0
into rap too and all that he did all rap

4960.199 --> 4964.159
performances and [ __ ]

4962.0 --> 4966.08
but he just had that depression thing

4964.159 --> 4967.94
that got worse and worse

4966.08 --> 4970.5199999999995
did apparently just didn't go away just

4967.94 --> 4973.639999999999
only got worse it's really terrible

4970.52 --> 4976.34
and but in my dreams that just he'd

4973.64 --> 4978.52
never had that he never had that side to

4976.34 --> 4978.52
him

4978.69 --> 4983.0599999999995
[Music]

4980.6 --> 4985.6990000000005
and because of that also because I'm

4983.06 --> 4987.38
much dreamer I kind of like didn't know

4985.699 --> 4990.259999999999
how to connect with him eventually

4987.38 --> 4993.1990000000005
because I just didn't like I just could

4990.26 --> 4995.179
not understand why he was like that in

4993.199 --> 4997.04
in the real world like

4995.179 --> 4999.4400000000005
because I was going through struggles

4997.04 --> 5001.36
like I was like getting into Alex Jones

4999.44 --> 5003.4
and figuring out the world is actually

5001.36 --> 5005.679
evil

5003.4 --> 5007.54
but I was like excited about it like

5005.679 --> 5009.88
yeah finally

5007.54 --> 5013.239
something to strive for something to be

5009.88 --> 5015.64
a man for but and I tried to even when I

5013.239 --> 5017.62
when I was in that

5015.64 --> 5020.9400000000005
one point I tried to communicate that

5017.62 --> 5020.94
with him like dude no

5021.94 --> 5027.46
you can't just

5023.8 --> 5029.9800000000005
go AWOL we have to fight this

5027.46 --> 5031.0
that's why it's so painful because you

5029.98 --> 5034.239
gotta fight

5031.0 --> 5036.28
but it didn't work it it was already

5034.239 --> 5038.98
sunken too deep

5036.28 --> 5042.0
back then

5038.98 --> 5042.0
this is like

5043.6 --> 5048.120000000001
I think was two thousand

5045.58 --> 5048.12
ten

5052.6 --> 5058.179
this was first my mom then my

5054.82 --> 5061.179
grandmother then my cousin my nephew

5058.179 --> 5063.219
right anyway

5061.179 --> 5066.9
I had a lot of deaths in the very short

5063.219 --> 5066.9
time span back then

5071.739 --> 5076.659
anyway

5073.96 --> 5080.5
sorry to maybe bring you down bringing

5076.659 --> 5083.379999999999
that up I mean it doesn't bring me down

5080.5 --> 5085.84
I mean I I just kind of miss my cousin

5083.38 --> 5086.9800000000005
my nephew I keep killing my cousin my

5085.84 --> 5089.02
nephew

5086.98 --> 5092.379999999999
I do miss it

5089.02 --> 5094.13

5137.32 --> 5142.0
yeah yeah I was saying you might

5139.78 --> 5144.28
potentially just not be very good at sex

5142.0 --> 5146.86
that's right I did actually say that

5144.28 --> 5151.5
indirectly

5146.86 --> 5151.5
you definitely did catch that shade

5151.96 --> 5154.7390000000005
foreign

5159.4 --> 5163.92
but I do understand what you mean though

5171.36 --> 5177.239
I mean before I even had sex with that

5174.699 --> 5177.239
two women

5178.239 --> 5182.44
in my dreams

5180.04 --> 5184.659
those types of dreams would blend up

5182.44 --> 5187.96
it's it's like I would constantly just

5184.659 --> 5190.179
blend up the feeling of love and sex but

5187.96 --> 5193.78
weird things would happen

5190.179 --> 5196.659
like it and now I realize that the real

5193.78 --> 5199.0
thing that actually made me simulate

5196.659 --> 5202.12
that was not the sex it was the Love

5199.0 --> 5205.02
Like Love is literally more gratifying

5202.12 --> 5205.0199999999995
than sex to me

5209.08 --> 5212.92
like the actual law of actually meaning

5211.239 --> 5216.159
it and that's also why it's so

5212.92 --> 5218.38
horrifically hurtful when it somehow

5216.159 --> 5220.42
stops

5218.38 --> 5224.88
from the other side

5220.42 --> 5224.88
because with me it tends to not

5226.3 --> 5232.4800000000005
but it's funny because yeah as a team oh

5229.78 --> 5234.88
I was a little obsessed with sex oh

5232.48 --> 5237.699
surprise surprise that never happens to

5234.88 --> 5239.86
guys yeah it does like pretty much

5237.699 --> 5243.82
everyone

5239.86 --> 5246.099999999999
and so those dreams Blended

5243.82 --> 5247.719
because love was actually the thing

5246.1 --> 5250.06
that's really drawn me but I was just

5247.719 --> 5253.9800000000005
really curious about sex and so those

5250.06 --> 5253.9800000000005
Blended but like weirdly

5254.08 --> 5261.46
now dad I've had actual sex

5258.42 --> 5265.62
including really good one

5261.46 --> 5269.92
good ones yeah most of it

5265.62 --> 5272.159
why because I make the effort why out of

5269.92 --> 5272.159
love

5275.92 --> 5281.08
it's almost like a sense of Duty but

5278.44 --> 5282.58
since then I don't really have sex

5281.08 --> 5287.0199999999995
dreams anymore

5282.58 --> 5288.639
now when I dream in that context it is a

5287.02 --> 5293.139
love dream

5288.639 --> 5295.0
it is just romance it's just a sweet

5293.139 --> 5298.0
woman

5295.0 --> 5300.1
and just like cuddling and staring into

5298.0 --> 5304.38
each other's eyes kind of like a bit

5300.1 --> 5306.9400000000005
sappy romantic but that works better

5304.38 --> 5308.4400000000005
I really like that

5306.94 --> 5312.339999999999
like

5308.44 --> 5313.659
I guess sort of like dating in my dreams

5312.34 --> 5319.179

5313.659 --> 5321.78
I I try to like not focus on sex

5461.8 --> 5468.96
there's not something anybody would

5464.739 --> 5468.959999999999
you shouldn't do that you should just

5473.02 --> 5477.1
yeah I mean everything that I

5475.0 --> 5479.62
experienced in my dreams I take just as

5477.1 --> 5482.8
serious as the real world

5479.62 --> 5485.159
maybe even more serious because your

5482.8 --> 5485.159000000001

5485.38 --> 5488.52
influence you

5494.92 --> 5501.159
a secret sin like a succubus or

something right oh yeah that's super

5501.159 --> 5505.179
cute yeah oh but it's not in the real

5503.199 --> 5508.78
world so it's okay yeah guess what it is

5505.179 --> 5510.76
going to do exactly the same to you as

5508.78 --> 5514.0
it would in the real world

5510.76 --> 5516.639
except nobody's seeing it but you will

5514.0 --> 5519.76
undergo that right because those

5516.639 --> 5521.86

5519.76 --> 5522.43

and if you think that'd be just because

5529.48 --> 5533.739
it's the dream that means it's not real

5531.4 --> 5536.5
hey yeah guess again

5533.739 --> 5539.739
because dreams are real

5536.5 --> 5543.159
just as real as the real world when it

5539.739 --> 5545.699

those lessons as a as a kid

5560.62 --> 5567.78
my parents did actually sort of teach me

5563.5 --> 5567.78
that that dreams are real too

5567.94 --> 5575.44

5571.36 --> 5577.839999999999
like Santa Claus magic in movies and all

5575.44 --> 5579.94

5579.94 --> 5583.48
that oh I don't believe in ghosts I

5581.739 --> 5587.799999999999
don't believe in that it's only a dream

yeah

5600.46 --> 5604.84
there's like no physical consequences

it's only a dream but guess what's gonna

5629.08 --> 5635.8
happen to those people in the real world

5632.86 --> 5637.839999999999
they are gonna be like that and they're

5635.8 --> 5639.639
just keeping it a secret

5637.84 --> 5641.4400000000005
because if they're doing it in their

5639.639 --> 5644.7390000000005
dreams but they're undergoing that so

5641.44 --> 5648.219
they are undergoing that corruption

5644.739 --> 5652.299999999999
this is what Grabbers do a lot of them

5648.219 --> 5656.219
they do their secret naughty [ __ ] a lot

5652.3 --> 5656.219
of it in their minds

5656.44 --> 5661.36
especially the illegal stuff

5658.9 --> 5663.099999999999
they do it in their minds

5661.36 --> 5664.659
that doesn't mean it doesn't corrupt

5663.1 --> 5666.76
them though

5664.659 --> 5668.739
just means they're not

5666.76 --> 5671.02
legally

5668.739 --> 5672.699
bound through actions in the physical

5671.02 --> 5674.92
world

5672.699 --> 5676.839999999999
they're still undergoing the corruption

5674.92 --> 5678.54
though

5676.84 --> 5682.8

5678.54 --> 5682.8
