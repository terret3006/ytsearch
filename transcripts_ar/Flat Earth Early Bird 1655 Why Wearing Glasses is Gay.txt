85.619 --> 94.02
right so yeah today is unbelievably hot

91.56 --> 96.18
so

94.02 --> 97.74
if it gets too much I'm gonna take my

96.18 --> 100.32000000000001
shirt off I've actually been walking

97.74 --> 102.479
around without it so

100.32 --> 105.17999999999999
but uh

102.479 --> 108.24
yeah 30 31 degrees

105.18 --> 112.34
and it's really humid

108.24 --> 112.33999999999999
a lot of moist in the air anyway

112.979 --> 118.14
it's not super bright like it was

115.92 --> 121.32000000000001
yesterday

118.14 --> 123.479
the sun is very hot still when it gets

121.32 --> 125.52
through but there's a lot of clouds

123.479 --> 127.259
going on and also yeah it's been

125.52 --> 130.01999999999998
predicted

127.259 --> 131.94
to be a storm

130.02 --> 134.42000000000002
later on so I'm kind of looking forward

131.94 --> 134.42
to that

134.94 --> 138.42
but I mean it's still so incredibly hot

137.16 --> 142.379
and

138.42 --> 144.599
not enough wind for my liking but I mean

142.379 --> 146.76
I'll bet that's gonna be

144.599 --> 151.26
uh

146.76 --> 153.239
gonna be back with a vengeance later

151.26 --> 156.29999999999998
Maybe

153.239 --> 158.09900000000002
maybe but yeah I mean it's that hard and

156.3 --> 161.9
just very little wind coming through I

158.099 --> 161.89999999999998
got all the doors open it's like

163.92 --> 167.78
something going on there but

172.92 --> 179.22
could be because the air so thick sound

175.8 --> 182.16000000000003
carries through more and I just hear the

179.22 --> 185.4
the whistling of the leaves

182.16 --> 187.85999999999999
in the wind louder

185.4 --> 190.37900000000002
but there's barely actually any wind

187.86 --> 192.72000000000003
going on so I'm noticing that effect

190.379 --> 194.51899999999998
every time

192.72 --> 197.159
the air is thick

194.519 --> 200.59900000000002
I hear more

197.159 --> 200.599
more detail it's weird

201.54 --> 205.379
anyway

202.98 --> 207.06
hello clammy first in chat good to see

205.379 --> 213.12
you

207.06 --> 213.12
it is Sunday the 9th of July 2023

215.879 --> 220.62
I am fully stocked

218.58 --> 223.019
Gusto energy drink which I'm really

220.62 --> 224.76
looking forward to just fresh out of the

223.019 --> 228.54
fridge

224.76 --> 230.519
so yeah a lot of rookola I had to rescue

228.54 --> 233.57999999999998
some of it because

230.519 --> 237.84
I don't know I bought it yesterday and

233.58 --> 239.459
it got into a quick rot somehow

237.84 --> 241.62
might have been because I've

239.459 --> 243.659
accidentally put it back a little bit

241.62 --> 248.34
too close to the actual

243.659 --> 250.879
cooling element of the fridge

248.34 --> 250.879
anyway

255.06 --> 259.639
might be a little slow because it's so

257.04 --> 259.639
freaking hot

261.36 --> 265.97900000000004
[Music]

263.94 --> 268.21999999999997
but I feel great though I had a great

265.979 --> 268.21999999999997
night

274.44 --> 283.139
that's the stuff

276.59 --> 283.13899999999995
[Music]

284.52 --> 288.65999999999997
yeah

286.38 --> 291.54
watch the movie

288.66 --> 294.0
mortal engines

291.54 --> 296.699
it was intense

294.0 --> 299.4
it was interesting was very character

296.699 --> 301.08000000000004
driven a little bit too much character

299.4 --> 303.12
driven almost

301.08 --> 306.38
and

303.12 --> 306.38
a little kitsch

308.639 --> 314.22
and when you really like the rides great

311.1 --> 315.96000000000004
the ride was really interesting

314.22 --> 318.74
acting was

315.96 --> 318.73999999999995
pretty good

318.84 --> 323.039
for a movie like that I mean it because

321.0 --> 325.259
it is kind of a

323.039 --> 328.259
dude it was so weird man I mean that

325.259 --> 329.699
movie is very interesting it's it is

328.259 --> 332.40000000000003
like

329.699 --> 335.28000000000003
World building they really built this

332.4 --> 338.52
world and they they took it there all

335.28 --> 343.28
the way CGI is a fully engaged with this

338.52 --> 343.28
thing it is a CGI spectacle a lot of it

344.36 --> 350.039
and it felt like it was a crossover in

348.3 --> 352.68
more than one way it's even script wise

350.039 --> 355.56
a bit of

352.68 --> 358.32
Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back

355.56 --> 361.039
Lord of the Rings

358.32 --> 361.039
and

361.56 --> 366.06
yeah I don't really know but there was

363.479 --> 368.58
like a distinct script from Empire

366.06 --> 372.38
Strikes Back That was starting to creep

368.58 --> 372.38
and they made a joke with it

372.72 --> 379.56
it's like it was a weird movie Man

376.68 --> 381.539
it was a weird ass movie and it but they

379.56 --> 384.06
really took the future

381.539 --> 386.699
building very

384.06 --> 389.16
very serious

386.699 --> 390.6
I loved how they called it stuff old

389.16 --> 393.41900000000004
Tech it's like

390.6 --> 398.53900000000004
it was a post-apocalyptic world

393.419 --> 398.539
like a post-futurist world basically

399.18 --> 405.90000000000003
like super laser weapon plasma [ __ ]

402.419 --> 408.24
high-tech Quantum web seriously the the

405.9 --> 410.15999999999997
super weapon was a Quantum weapon of

408.24 --> 413.58
course it was

410.16 --> 415.56
and it was all destroyed because yeah

413.58 --> 418.74
they blew each other up and then this is

415.56 --> 421.5
what comes after and it's like medieval

418.74 --> 422.94
with like technology they just find but

421.5 --> 424.979
people don't know what to do with it

422.94 --> 426.78
because they all became spoiled by the

424.979 --> 428.46
machine like the machine just did

426.78 --> 430.73999999999995
everything for them it's not really

428.46 --> 432.96
explicitly set but I mean

430.74 --> 434.16
it's logically inferred if you think

432.96 --> 437.65999999999997
about it

434.16 --> 437.66
they don't really talk about it

438.06 --> 442.68
and they're scared of computers that's

440.4 --> 445.56
interesting like I the World building

442.68 --> 448.5
was really really interesting

445.56 --> 450.96
like refine very fine detail that

448.5 --> 453.86
literally they did it the right way the

450.96 --> 456.479
old-fashioned way of just like

453.86 --> 458.58000000000004
quickly just a sentence

456.479 --> 461.099
oh that

458.58 --> 462.96
and like they don't really elaborate

461.099 --> 465.3
further on it but like

462.96 --> 467.21999999999997
because of the way in the natural way

465.3 --> 468.66
it's presented you really get to feel

467.22 --> 472.68
like oh [ __ ] there's this whole

468.66 --> 475.199
background there man like they invoke

472.68 --> 477.479
it like a game master

475.199 --> 479.699
they invoke little details that really

477.479 --> 481.919
put your imagination to work it was a

479.699 --> 485.34000000000003
very interesting movie

481.919 --> 485.94
right so mortal engine it's also [ __ ]

485.34 --> 489.919
up

485.94 --> 489.919
but it was interesting and it has

490.94 --> 496.979
agent Smith

493.139 --> 499.68
as the main as Pro yeah big role in it

496.979 --> 503.84
very prominent

499.68 --> 503.84000000000003
he's sort of like the king

505.199 --> 511.58000000000004
it was interesting but also very kitchen

507.9 --> 511.58
very many ways but

513.24 --> 518.52
fascinating

515.52 --> 524.64
it was something else anyway

518.52 --> 528.26
The Witcher uh you'd love it no no

524.64 --> 528.26
I find it grotesque

530.1 --> 533.1
foreign

533.54 --> 541.26
is like a really repulsive to me

538.08 --> 544.62
it's like Gothic but in a really gross

541.26 --> 546.06
way I don't like it I don't like it I

544.62 --> 548.64
mean yeah there's some interesting

546.06 --> 550.8
Concepts that are really like Hey Oh

548.64 --> 553.68
chemical concept bang bang bang bang

550.8 --> 557.2199999999999
bang if you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] and you

553.68 --> 560.399
don't get those things yeah yeah that's

557.22 --> 562.74
very interesting about it but it's

560.399 --> 565.8
overall repulsive I found the game

562.74 --> 569.779
repulsive and idiotic like genuinely

565.8 --> 572.9399999999999
idiotic like you can't play the game

569.779 --> 575.9399999999999
it's so [ __ ] complicated you have to

572.94 --> 578.8800000000001
like find cheat codes

575.94 --> 581.7
and that like just to know what the [ __ ]

578.88 --> 584.7
to do with that [ __ ] game I hate it I

581.7 --> 588.0
hated it I'm not the only one

584.7 --> 592.82
and I find the series just kind of a

588.0 --> 592.82
repulsive kids reminder of that

593.339 --> 598.399
and it's also grim and I hate that

599.399 --> 603.019
I I don't like that at all

605.7 --> 611.399
I like it when there is like when

607.86 --> 614.519
somebody's like seriously repressed

611.399 --> 616.5
like they're not feeling as a defense

614.519 --> 618.3
right

616.5 --> 620.64
but

618.3 --> 622.8599999999999
you gotta actually have feeling or

620.64 --> 625.5
you're dealing with a cursed person and

622.86 --> 628.38
that could never lead to anything good

625.5 --> 630.36
and that's like

628.38 --> 633.36
the whole thing is [ __ ] I hate The

630.36 --> 634.5600000000001
Witcher I hate the concept I hate the

633.36 --> 638.72
series

634.56 --> 638.7199999999999
they hate the games it sucks

639.8 --> 644.2199999999999
is different I don't I've I haven't seen

642.959 --> 646.56
any of it

644.22 --> 648.36
I've seen a trailer of The Witcher and

646.56 --> 649.9799999999999
that was enough to make me throw up

648.36 --> 653.42
almost

649.98 --> 653.4200000000001
metaphorical in this case

654.18 --> 659.459
like big bear reviewed it

657.24 --> 661.98
and that's why I said like yeah there's

659.459 --> 664.38
some alchemical [ __ ] in there it's like

661.98 --> 665.76
if you really need to have it banged on

664.38 --> 667.5
your head if you don't get those things

665.76 --> 670.019
already

667.5 --> 672.54
but

670.019 --> 675.26
it's evil

672.54 --> 675.26
okay

675.73 --> 678.929
[Music]

685.019 --> 689.04
anyway

687.48 --> 694.32
hello

689.04 --> 697.519
letter Sage Nathan Oakley Terry 306

694.32 --> 702.2
let her see yeah glammy again

697.519 --> 702.2
sorry I need to focus a little bit more

702.779 --> 710.0
I really don't like that but I mean I

706.44 --> 713.6400000000001
guess that that's just me being

710.0 --> 715.44
allergic or something like dude I went

713.64 --> 717.66
through that sort of well not literally

715.44 --> 722.5400000000001
like that of course

717.66 --> 722.54
I I was among dark people

722.76 --> 728.7
that did Dark [ __ ] and that taught me

725.459 --> 731.7199999999999
like dark magic tricks that I'm not

728.7 --> 731.72
gonna tell people

732.899 --> 738.48
in ways I'm fascinated of that of how

736.44 --> 741.4200000000001
things work like that but it's not

738.48 --> 742.74
knowledge that anybody should know

741.42 --> 746.519
yeah

742.74 --> 748.6800000000001
yeah because just knowing is a burden

746.519 --> 751.279
and there's nothing good you can really

748.68 --> 751.279
do with it

752.16 --> 757.68
even if you try to like oh find the

754.8 --> 760.1999999999999
right moment in the right time and then

757.68 --> 762.779
All Is Forgiven or everybody wants you

760.2 --> 765.3000000000001
to do it but it doesn't matter

762.779 --> 769.98
it doesn't matter

765.3 --> 772.4399999999999
dark magic stuff is just oh it never

769.98 --> 774.0
leads to anything good

772.44 --> 777.899
yeah

774.0 --> 780.06
in my actual Journey with people that

777.899 --> 782.459
engage with that kind of [ __ ] I am very

780.06 --> 784.38
certain is that every everybody that

782.459 --> 788.579
engages with evil

784.38 --> 788.579
they all sacrifice

788.94 --> 793.74
but you could think and you could like

792.12 --> 795.779
think like all that means they have to

793.74 --> 798.779
sacrifice other people but

795.779 --> 800.9399999999999
that's not the point the point is is

798.779 --> 804.5
that they sacrifice part of their Spirit

800.94 --> 804.5
like it's inevitable

807.48 --> 814.62
like it's not like oh the the Alchemy or

811.38 --> 817.32
the mystical power or the spirit things

814.62 --> 819.72
oh you have to lay down a portion no

817.32 --> 821.0400000000001
it's literally God takes it away from

819.72 --> 823.38
you

821.04 --> 825.24
and they don't like to talk about it

823.38 --> 828.3
ever

825.24 --> 830.7
yeah that's the real price

828.3 --> 832.38
I've seen it

830.7 --> 835.7
seen people

832.38 --> 835.7
pay that price

837.36 --> 843.3000000000001
and from foolish still

840.12 --> 844.98
kind of cool guys turn into like

843.3 --> 846.959
hollowed out

844.98 --> 849.0600000000001
demons like that

846.959 --> 852.5999999999999
lost people

849.06 --> 854.8199999999999
only left with those impulses that

852.6 --> 858.12
brought them to that place

854.82 --> 859.8000000000001
they lose their original Spirit they

858.12 --> 862.019
lose their youth

859.8 --> 863.639
they use the you they lose all those

862.019 --> 865.62
impulses

863.639 --> 867.779
it's terrible

865.62 --> 869.94
you always pay the price it's not part

867.779 --> 871.4399999999999
of the alchemical process or the Magic

869.94 --> 875.399
Ritual no

871.44 --> 878.519
God just [ __ ] takes it away from you

875.399 --> 881.0
yeah like from the outer Dimension it's

878.519 --> 881.0
just like

881.1 --> 885.66
it's gone

882.779 --> 887.279
never getting that back like you you

885.66 --> 890.2199999999999
can't get it back because you don't

887.279 --> 893.3389999999999
remember any of it

890.22 --> 894.6700000000001
like you can't remember that part

893.339 --> 897.87
of you anymore

894.67 --> 897.87
[Music]

902.67 --> 908.04
[Music]

905.579 --> 911.0999999999999
you can't

908.04 --> 912.959
lower your way

911.1 --> 916.5
through evil magic

912.959 --> 917.6389999999999
despite a whole category of

916.5 --> 920.16
people

917.639 --> 922.5
that like to believe or have an entire

920.16 --> 924.8389999999999
Traditions to fool themselves into

922.5 --> 927.24
thinking that you could do that

924.839 --> 928.8000000000001
just if you just like explain it like

927.24 --> 932.5790000000001
this

928.8 --> 934.199
oh yes that's very cute you could

932.579 --> 936.4799999999999
definitely fool yourself with that

934.199 --> 938.2199999999999
[ __ ] that you made up with with your

936.48 --> 943.4590000000001
peers

938.22 --> 943.4590000000001
but in reality it doesn't work

944.519 --> 950.22
anyway hey ajm

946.68 --> 952.26
Dr utker dank

950.22 --> 956.279
I got the Full House yeah I feel much

952.26 --> 958.019
better man that Gusto was a great

956.279 --> 960.06
it's like almost the heat Almost Doesn't

958.019 --> 962.88
Even burden me anymore because I was

960.06 --> 964.92
really like ah I'm melting and if I even

962.88 --> 968.04
when I started doing my intro I just

964.92 --> 970.079
felt I heated up from the activity but

968.04 --> 973.38
now that I took a sip of this it's like

970.079 --> 974.88
oh it doesn't overheat me anymore that's

973.38 --> 977.16
weird

974.88 --> 978.779
anyway it's an interesting subject I've

977.16 --> 981.0
been really like despite the heat I've

978.779 --> 984.12
been really

981.0 --> 987.24
diving a lot and like diving back I've

984.12 --> 991.139
I'm really starting to

987.24 --> 994.22
now get an A better

991.139 --> 994.22
more clear

994.82 --> 1002.3000000000001
oversight of the result of my efforts

999.66 --> 1005.36
to categorize myself

1002.3 --> 1007.16
in yeah interdimensionally like as I

1005.36 --> 1009.6800000000001
basically what I've been doing been

1007.16 --> 1011.53
telling you guys all these things about

1009.68 --> 1012.68
myself a cataloging when

1011.53 --> 1016.3
[Music]

1012.68 --> 1016.3
why what I felt like

1017.12 --> 1024.199
and I'm starting to get it better

1021.079 --> 1026.02
because just knowing what is there

1024.199 --> 1029.66
does it mean that you really understand

1026.02 --> 1032.9
why and how every time now even as I go

1029.66 --> 1034.1000000000001
through it I Stumble immediately upon

1032.9 --> 1036.26
things

1034.1 --> 1039.02
that I'm figuring out as I'm thinking

1036.26 --> 1041.24
back I had this happens all the time

1039.02 --> 1043.459
and you guys might even think like oh

1041.24 --> 1046.339
yeah he thought about this earlier and

1043.459 --> 1050.059
and now he's rolling it out no no

1046.339 --> 1052.1599999999999
most of the time it's instantaneous I

1050.059 --> 1055.82
bring it up I had not thought about it

1052.16 --> 1059.1200000000001
before and boom click

1055.82 --> 1061.8799999999999
full picture is there now I have to

1059.12 --> 1065.7399999999998
catch up with my explanation that's how

1061.88 --> 1065.74
it really that's how I function

1068.6 --> 1075.039
and I could do it with anything

1070.76 --> 1075.039
as long as I'm stable

1079.58 --> 1084.1399999999999
ah

1081.86 --> 1088.039
and the funny thing is

1084.14 --> 1090.26
those things that roll out they're very

1088.039 --> 1092.66
freaking cohesive sometimes they're

1090.26 --> 1095.799
cohesive in ways

1092.66 --> 1095.799
that I don't even understand

1098.24 --> 1104.539
then I attain certainty about things

1101.0 --> 1107.9
that I have no cognitive reason

1104.539 --> 1109.64
to have that certainty about them

1107.9 --> 1112.1200000000001
it's like I grab it from the other

1109.64 --> 1112.1200000000001
dimension

1112.16 --> 1114.76
what's this

1115.82 --> 1117.82
um

1123.08 --> 1130.3999999999999
I didn't believe it nonsensical cop oh

1125.96 --> 1132.32
what oh the earth oh [ __ ]

1130.4 --> 1134.72
the Flat Earth

1132.32 --> 1136.8999999999999
do you believe it's flat you used to

1134.72 --> 1136.9
believe

1137.059 --> 1140.96
yeah I've got some recent trigger troll

1139.22 --> 1142.88
[ __ ]

1140.96 --> 1146.9
they're trying to email me and all this

1142.88 --> 1149.419
[ __ ] but I mean it's garbage

1146.9 --> 1152.2
these people are like obsessed

1149.419 --> 1152.2
it's like

1152.24 --> 1156.2
it's interesting by the way how that

1154.34 --> 1158.299
type of obsession works with people I

1156.2 --> 1159.14
know a lot about it because I I was in

1158.299 --> 1162.32
it

1159.14 --> 1165.919
yeah that kind of triggered response is

1162.32 --> 1167.1789999999999
very familiar to me because I had that

1165.919 --> 1169.46
but

1167.179 --> 1171.8600000000001
here's the big difference between the

1169.46 --> 1175.4
numpties that are doing this now and me

1171.86 --> 1179.3799999999999
way back when I where I recognize those

1175.4 --> 1179.38
impulses from from my inside

1179.84 --> 1186.4399999999998
I didn't engage with it because before

1184.039 --> 1189.559
it would start rolling out of me like

1186.44 --> 1192.14
some automaton I would immediately

1189.559 --> 1194.0
recognize that it's only venting of

1192.14 --> 1199.16
weakness

1194.0 --> 1202.16
because I have instantaneous oversight

1199.16 --> 1204.559
before so I know the end result of what

1202.16 --> 1207.2
I'm gonna do before I do it

1204.559 --> 1210.3799999999999
and I realized very quickly when I tried

1207.2 --> 1212.3600000000001
to basically argue as a Bollard against

1210.38 --> 1214.5800000000002
a flat Earth that's like halfway

1212.36 --> 1216.26
competent mechanically

1214.58 --> 1217.53
because there are some physicists out

1216.26 --> 1219.44
there

1217.53 --> 1221.66
[Music]

1219.44 --> 1224.0
and that we're willing to engage with

1221.66 --> 1225.799
that and because they trusted me to not

1224.0 --> 1227.96
get hostile

1225.799 --> 1230.24
because most people that are globers

1227.96 --> 1231.919
when you engage with them like that they

1230.24 --> 1234.98
get hostile

1231.919 --> 1236.3600000000001
I did not because I knew that was

1234.98 --> 1240.58
weakness

1236.36 --> 1240.58
it was very torturous though sometimes

1241.28 --> 1247.7
but I would instead let it give me all

1244.64 --> 1249.98
it's like I don't understand why my

1247.7 --> 1251.48
position is weaker and why I feel this

1249.98 --> 1254.6200000000001
rage

1251.48 --> 1254.6200000000001
that's mystical

1254.72 --> 1259.34
and then my conclusion would be from

1257.059 --> 1261.799
internally

1259.34 --> 1264.22
if I am so

1261.799 --> 1266.72
in such a stuck position

1264.22 --> 1270.02
spiritually like that within that

1266.72 --> 1272.66
argumentation then there must be

1270.02 --> 1276.62
something about this Flat Earth

1272.66 --> 1278.8400000000001
if from a baller perspective I cannot

1276.62 --> 1280.82
continue

1278.84 --> 1283.3999999999999
directly

1280.82 --> 1286.6399999999999
because you can continue non-durably

1283.4 --> 1288.8600000000001
basically bitching all the time but I I

1286.64 --> 1291.26
knew that was fruitless and I was weak

1288.86 --> 1292.8799999999999
and I was not weak like I'm like if I'm

1291.26 --> 1295.1589999999999
gonna be a baller I'm gonna do it right

1292.88 --> 1299.3200000000002
that was basically my decision before I

1295.159 --> 1299.3200000000002
even realized that it wasn't you know

1299.78 --> 1303.9189999999999
so I would then engage with the Flat

1301.94 --> 1306.2
Earth I basically hurt them out not get

1303.919 --> 1307.8200000000002
triggered response all the time but

1306.2 --> 1310.5800000000002
curious

1307.82 --> 1312.6789999999999
like oh but I've heard about I would

1310.58 --> 1315.02
even like already adapt to like I've

1312.679 --> 1317.7800000000002
heard baller say this

1315.02 --> 1319.7
because I can adapt so I would adapt to

1317.78 --> 1321.08
being a flat earther in that moment even

1319.7 --> 1323.6000000000001
though I wasn't

1321.08 --> 1326.24
just to get the clear answers out of

1323.6 --> 1328.34
them and not trigger anybody

1326.24 --> 1331.7
and then the end of it I would be like

1328.34 --> 1333.5
yeah that all makes logical sense

1331.7 --> 1335.72
but

1333.5 --> 1339.4
there's still something about this ball

1335.72 --> 1339.4
there's a reason why it's there

1339.98 --> 1345.02
like and

1342.08 --> 1347.24
so I would kind of like compartmentalize

1345.02 --> 1348.86
it then it's like okay yeah the the

1347.24 --> 1351.5
flattered absolutely makes sense

1348.86 --> 1353.4799999999998
although it stands out that you don't

1351.5 --> 1356.36
know everything about it

1353.48 --> 1358.34
and then they would say yeah but you

1356.36 --> 1361.1
don't know anything about the ball what

1358.34 --> 1364.28
do you actually know a bunch of stories

1361.1 --> 1367.84
a bunch of CGI pictures

1364.28 --> 1367.84
that would really fluster me

1370.58 --> 1375.1399999999999
but I would always firmly believe like

1372.74 --> 1377.78
no we can build it we can figure it out

1375.14 --> 1379.7
and then they realize like yeah there's

1377.78 --> 1382.039
you can

1379.7 --> 1384.559
convince somebody in that position that

1382.039 --> 1386.6589999999999
is like no we will we will figure it out

1384.559 --> 1390.1399999999999
because I was Fanatic in that set

1386.659 --> 1392.2990000000002
because anything I do is fanatic

1390.14 --> 1395.44
because if you don't do it fanatically

1392.299 --> 1395.44
then you do it halfway

1397.88 --> 1402.44
all right so I had all this weird

1399.46 --> 1405.8600000000001
compartmentalization going on

1402.44 --> 1408.26
when facing Flat Earth in the past

1405.86 --> 1410.9189999999999
and and yeah now I explained some of the

1408.26 --> 1410.919
intricacies

1410.96 --> 1416.3600000000001
from my perspective as a baller how I

1414.02 --> 1419.179
would deal with it and I am actually

1416.36 --> 1423.1399999999999
seeing some people in here

1419.179 --> 1425.8400000000001
that are kind of catching on to that

1423.14 --> 1428.0
like themselves they are behaving much

1425.84 --> 1430.9399999999998
better

1428.0 --> 1433.34
they are realizing what is foolish

1430.94 --> 1436.46
because I mean they will a lot of them

1433.34 --> 1439.1
will have like impulses like oh no

1436.46 --> 1442.58
no but it is a ball

1439.1 --> 1444.5
but they like they jump in when they

1442.58 --> 1446.6
want to add information that they know

1444.5 --> 1447.86
relates even though it's from a baller

1446.6 --> 1450.799
perspective

1447.86 --> 1452.84
but they're not like pushing it too hard

1450.799 --> 1455.299
sometimes somebody slips up but it's

1452.84 --> 1458.299
usually when I really hate it and then

1455.299 --> 1461.059
I'm like yeah okay I did kind of I did

1458.299 --> 1463.28
kind of strike that match so yeah this

1461.059 --> 1465.44
one's on me

1463.28 --> 1467.1789999999999
even though I might kick you out but

1465.44 --> 1469.46
then I'll probably end kick you out

1467.179 --> 1470.659
unless you went really dirty or

1469.46 --> 1472.58
something

1470.659 --> 1474.98
right because it still matters if you're

1472.58 --> 1476.8999999999999
gonna get triggered even if I lit your

1474.98 --> 1478.76
match on purpose

1476.9 --> 1481.159
it still matters how you're going to

1478.76 --> 1483.799
burn if you're gonna completely show

1481.159 --> 1486.7990000000002
some [ __ ] up [ __ ]

1483.799 --> 1488.96
in that moment then that's really a

1486.799 --> 1491.0
problem right in my personal

1488.96 --> 1493.3400000000001
interactions with other people I never

1491.0 --> 1497.6
go like demonic like I might get rage

1493.34 --> 1499.82
when like really angry and like accusing

1497.6 --> 1503.0
but I never go really like [ __ ] up

1499.82 --> 1504.98
dirty or backstabbing with interactions

1503.0 --> 1506.6
I only get really

1504.98 --> 1508.039
more like

1506.6 --> 1510.1399999999999
dark

1508.039 --> 1513.86
when I'm talking

1510.14 --> 1517.8400000000001
in General on my own show not to a not

1513.86 --> 1517.84
addressing a person directly like that

1522.74 --> 1528.32
no doctor no that's fine

1526.159 --> 1531.44
I hadn't actually seen it

1528.32 --> 1532.76
I was to engage with thinking about what

1531.44 --> 1536.38
I was talking about

1532.76 --> 1536.3799999999999
so no that's fine

1537.08 --> 1542.72
but if he's

1538.4 --> 1544.52
if he or she he take whatever

1542.72 --> 1546.74
comes back and starts immediately

1544.52 --> 1548.539
spamming nonsense again yeah then I I

1546.74 --> 1551.179
will take care of it

1548.539 --> 1553.779
right

1551.179 --> 1553.779
anyway

1565.75 --> 1568.98
[Music]

1572.779 --> 1578.48
right so

1575.24 --> 1580.88
because of my experience in the past of

1578.48 --> 1582.5
how I was as a baller

1580.88 --> 1584.48
and how I realized there's something

1582.5 --> 1587.2
about flutter it's very funny that that

1584.48 --> 1590.059
was in like the shuffle back thing

1587.2 --> 1592.7
Illuminati card game or whatever like

1590.059 --> 1595.6589999999999
the flat earthers they know something

1592.7 --> 1599.9
because that was

1595.659 --> 1602.5390000000002
my actual stance when I was a baller and

1599.9 --> 1605.179
I didn't understand it

1602.539 --> 1607.1
and realized

1605.179 --> 1608.9
that you can't really talk about that

1607.1 --> 1610.8799999999999
that's very rare

1608.9 --> 1613.24
to bump into somebody that would bring

1610.88 --> 1613.24
it up

1615.26 --> 1621.279
you could almost say I kind of used my

1618.559 --> 1621.279
baller position

1622.58 --> 1629.36
to trigger like because I would bring it

1625.94 --> 1630.74
up ball stuff in private situations in

1629.36 --> 1632.539
one-on-one

1630.74 --> 1635.0
or when you do that

1632.539 --> 1637.1589999999999
if guy is a flat Earth or any feels like

1635.0 --> 1640.039
yeah no this guy isn't dangerous and he

1637.159 --> 1641.779
gets bullied and he's not

1640.039 --> 1643.7
I could try this

1641.779 --> 1646.46
I would basically be kind of like

1643.7 --> 1648.38
inviting for people to try to wake me up

1646.46 --> 1652.7
to Flat Earth

1648.38 --> 1656.0
I seemed like I was open for that

1652.7 --> 1658.46
and I kind of knew that I kind of

1656.0 --> 1660.5
presented myself like I would bring up

1658.46 --> 1663.02
the ball on purpose

1660.5 --> 1664.7
to see if it would trigger them to

1663.02 --> 1665.779
basically talk to me about Flat Earth

1664.7 --> 1669.52
because

1665.779 --> 1669.52
I wanted to know about it

1673.64 --> 1677.779
it's like I would always be talking

1675.44 --> 1679.52
about the ball stuff and what oh what

1677.779 --> 1682.039
they're going to do and oh how far the

1679.52 --> 1683.72
satellites Like Satellites and space

1682.039 --> 1686.179
stations like oh when are we going to

1683.72 --> 1687.8600000000001
build a space Bridge

1686.179 --> 1689.419
I would talk about that stuff but it

1687.86 --> 1691.8799999999999
wouldn't be like super cool it wouldn't

1689.419 --> 1694.039
be more like padding like yeah that's

1691.88 --> 1696.14
always in the background stuff no but if

1694.039 --> 1699.1
somebody actually brought up Flat Earth

1696.14 --> 1704.44
now that would be like whoa

1699.1 --> 1704.4399999999998
holy [ __ ] there's a secret lore

1704.659 --> 1710.48
now that would give a kick

1708.32 --> 1714.74
oh hello literally

1710.48 --> 1717.76
and Dr Bass awkwards

1714.74 --> 1717.76
steam Traveler

1726.799 --> 1729.279
anyway

1729.559 --> 1734.74
I'm watching a new movie or which is an

1732.32 --> 1734.74
old movie

1740.0 --> 1746.179
oh my God for is this

1742.7 --> 1749.9
like it's a full-on Grappler movie

1746.179 --> 1750.919
it's Once Upon a Time in America and it

1749.9 --> 1753.8600000000001
is

1750.919 --> 1756.46
super super Grappler movie I mean if

1753.86 --> 1759.26
you're like a fan of that movie which is

1756.46 --> 1762.32
extremely absurdly long by the way it's

1759.26 --> 1765.86
like five hours or something what the

1762.32 --> 1767.96
[ __ ] and sometimes scenes like there's

1765.86 --> 1769.399
nothing really happening it's all very

1767.96 --> 1771.679
slow

1769.399 --> 1774.1999999999998
enough that I can basically just start

1771.679 --> 1776.0590000000002
doing other things and

1774.2 --> 1778.46
and then I hear something is like oh

1776.059 --> 1780.1399999999999
wait something's happening

1778.46 --> 1782.059
and then there's other parts where there

1780.14 --> 1783.38
is plenty happening but it's like it's

1782.059 --> 1786.32
kind of slow

1783.38 --> 1789.46
and like every freaking person there is

1786.32 --> 1789.46
a full-on Grappler

1796.399 --> 1803.6
I I'm not even gonna say like

1800.48 --> 1806.0
like those people like I did not see

1803.6 --> 1809.539
yeah there was like only a couple of

1806.0 --> 1812.98
references even to like

1809.539 --> 1812.98
like going

1813.14 --> 1818.5
to the what did they call it Temple or

1815.96 --> 1818.5
uh

1820.22 --> 1826.34
like did they were just it was just all

1822.98 --> 1827.96
crime all of it and prostitution crime

1826.34 --> 1829.399
and prostitution crime and prostitution

1827.96 --> 1831.2
the whole [ __ ] thing is crime

1829.399 --> 1834.08
prostitution

1831.2 --> 1837.919
like this

1834.08 --> 1841.1789999999999
and like with music I don't know man

1837.919 --> 1841.179
it was so Gravelly

1844.1 --> 1848.02
in so long

1845.84 --> 1848.02
foreign

1848.6 --> 1852.58
Once Upon a Time in America

1853.88 --> 1856.6000000000001
right

1857.059 --> 1861.5
I'm not through it yet but it's all like

1859.64 --> 1864.22
oh

1861.5 --> 1864.22
it just

1864.98 --> 1872.0
like it's full of like victim feelings

1869.779 --> 1874.64
stuff and not that people are really

1872.0 --> 1878.12
like poor me but it's like

1874.64 --> 1880.88
oh so dramatic poor him it it is really

1878.12 --> 1883.299
like super gravel the whole freaking

1880.88 --> 1883.2990000000002
movie

1883.88 --> 1886.5200000000002
um

1884.659 --> 1889.88
they literally want to block yourself

1886.52 --> 1892.779
yeah yeah well that's dude oh do you

1889.88 --> 1892.779
think that's nucleary

1893.779 --> 1898.539
dude Bill Gates was talking about that

1896.12 --> 1898.539
like

1900.32 --> 1906.9399999999998
in the in the 2000s somewhere there like

1904.279 --> 1906.94
dude

1907.659 --> 1913.3400000000001
literally this and that

1911.24 --> 1916.52
dude they say all kinds of things like

1913.34 --> 1917.6589999999999
I'm you really think that they block out

1916.52 --> 1920.299
the Sun

1917.659 --> 1922.46
really even if they could

1920.299 --> 1924.62
there's all kinds of other stuff that

1922.46 --> 1926.1200000000001
they're literally trying to implement I

1924.62 --> 1928.8799999999999
think that those things kind of have

1926.12 --> 1931.4599999999998
priority and they're just throwing out

1928.88 --> 1934.46
these extremities

1931.46 --> 1937.22
based on people's ignorance

1934.46 --> 1940.279
and in their belief that mankind can

1937.22 --> 1943.159
actually destroy the Earth and all that

1940.279 --> 1945.74
to distract away from the actual urgent

1943.159 --> 1947.8990000000001
case of

1945.74 --> 1950.539
these conspirators in governments

1947.899 --> 1951.7399999999998
literally trying to enslave the people I

1950.539 --> 1954.679
mean

1951.74 --> 1957.02
all that stuff broken out the sun is a

1954.679 --> 1959.48
literal distraction from the actual

1957.02 --> 1960.9189999999999
underground things that are now playing

1959.48 --> 1964.8990000000001
out

1960.919 --> 1964.8990000000001
don't let it distract you

1967.1 --> 1972.98
broke today yeah yeah we all die don't

1970.64 --> 1977.5590000000002
you know that Clary

1972.98 --> 1977.559
everybody that lives dies

1981.14 --> 1985.94
except if you're like an undead monster

1983.24 --> 1989.0
like in

1985.94 --> 1991.7
mortal engine

1989.0 --> 1994.1
yeah that's in there and they play it

1991.7 --> 1996.14
out like it's actually oh it's a tragic

1994.1 --> 1999.019
character which is also super gravel but

1996.14 --> 2001.6000000000001
I mean it is like yeah

1999.019 --> 2004.059
it is like a interesting character for

2001.6 --> 2006.519
Dungeons and Dragons

2004.059 --> 2011.26
campaign

2006.519 --> 2011.26
but it just seemed kind of weird

2011.44 --> 2016.48
in it that movie is weird man mortal

2014.26 --> 2018.1
engine is a weird ass movie in many ways

2016.48 --> 2021.72
kitsch

2018.1 --> 2021.7199999999998
but fascinating

2031.0 --> 2034.38
Spirit Never Dies

2035.44 --> 2040.679
oh that depends on your definition of

2037.96 --> 2040.679
spirit but

2041.26 --> 2045.12
if it's just enthusiasm

2052.899 --> 2056.22
second hand smoke

2062.26 --> 2066.2200000000003
who deliberately breathes mosquito yeah

2064.96 --> 2068.5
but it's

2066.22 --> 2071.879
Dr Bass awkward

2068.5 --> 2071.879
here's the weirdest thing

2072.399 --> 2077.44
let malaria [ __ ] that is trying which is

2075.399 --> 2078.94
actually happening

2077.44 --> 2080.919
it's different

2078.94 --> 2084.58
because

2080.919 --> 2086.1389999999997
it's very easy to get rid of them again

2084.58 --> 2088.06
you see

2086.139 --> 2090.3990000000003
there have been like professional

2088.06 --> 2092.679
mosquito breeders that breed mosquitoes

2090.399 --> 2095.08
specifically to eradicate those

2092.679 --> 2098.08
mosquitoes they breed the stereo

2095.08 --> 2100.359
mosquitoes and then

2098.08 --> 2103.42
yeah

2100.359 --> 2105.8199999999997
the fertile ones made with them and then

2103.42 --> 2107.6800000000003
they don't procreate and then they die

2105.82 --> 2110.079
it's very effective that's been

2107.68 --> 2113.7999999999997
happening for decades

2110.079 --> 2115.7200000000003
okay so this yeah you shouldn't say

2113.8 --> 2117.94
anybody who's gonna read mosquito no no

2115.72 --> 2119.4399999999996
that's use is very effective Pest

2117.94 --> 2122.8
Control the problem is is that Bill

2119.44 --> 2124.42
Gates basically is just lying like to

2122.8 --> 2126.099
your face double speak it's not even

2124.42 --> 2127.9
like it's just double speaking to your

2126.099 --> 2130.3590000000004
face but yeah I am breeding these

2127.9 --> 2132.579
mosquitoes to help against this disease

2130.359 --> 2135.22
even though he earlier said

2132.579 --> 2137.8590000000004
and he had vaccine mosquitoes

2135.22 --> 2140.3799999999997
which is basically like oh I'm going to

2137.859 --> 2142.72
send out mosquitoes against malaria but

2140.38 --> 2146.619
there are no malaria mosquitoes

2142.72 --> 2150.48
they weren't there in Florida right

2146.619 --> 2153.4
no he's literally unleashing just

2150.48 --> 2157.2400000000002
mosquitoes so he's kind of using that

2153.4 --> 2158.8
industry now as a racketeering tool

2157.24 --> 2160.8999999999996
because they could get rid of those

2158.8 --> 2162.2200000000003
mosquitoes too

2160.9 --> 2165.2200000000003
see

2162.22 --> 2168.4599999999996
this industrial racketeering

2165.22 --> 2171.06
bio industrial racketeering that's what

2168.46 --> 2171.06
he's doing now

2178.03 --> 2183.1800000000003
[Music]

2180.22 --> 2183.18
[ __ ]

2185.68 --> 2190.06
yeah

2187.06 --> 2193.06
that makes us look vax key back these

2190.06 --> 2194.0789999999997
supposed vaccine mosquitoes it doesn't

2193.06 --> 2196.839
exist

2194.079 --> 2197.98
telling you right now I've told you

2196.839 --> 2201.099
before

2197.98 --> 2204.88
yeah it's a science fiction [ __ ]

2201.099 --> 2209.1400000000003
story it's literally more likely

2204.88 --> 2213.28
that he's made mechanical mosquitoes

2209.14 --> 2216.46
with micro injection needles

2213.28 --> 2219.76
right it's more likely

2216.46 --> 2222.339
and and not very likely okay but it's

2219.76 --> 2225.5200000000004
much more likely that

2222.339 --> 2227.32
has little robot mosquitoes with little

2225.52 --> 2229.96
vaccine

2227.32 --> 2232.119
injection capabilities like micro and

2229.96 --> 2234.52
they would still work somehow

2232.119 --> 2235.92
is more logical that he would do that

2234.52 --> 2238.18
than

2235.92 --> 2240.9
bio-engineered vaccines because that's

2238.18 --> 2244.24
not possible yeah

2240.9 --> 2248.2000000000003
vaccine substance the things that is

2244.24 --> 2249.9399999999996
uses is not compatible with living

2248.2 --> 2252.8799999999997
beings

2249.94 --> 2258.16
it doesn't work the only thing you can

2252.88 --> 2259.839
spread with living beings is parasites

2258.16 --> 2261.52
yeah

2259.839 --> 2264.64
so that's

2261.52 --> 2266.94
what he's doing now

2264.64 --> 2270.16
you can't spread

2266.94 --> 2273.82
mosquitoes that inject vaccines

2270.16 --> 2277.7799999999997
yeah the thing they inject is like this

2273.82 --> 2281.32
saliva that stuff you can't transform a

2277.78 --> 2284.26
mosquito to make the grand thing in a

2281.32 --> 2288.28
stable sense into somehow this micro

2284.26 --> 2290.44
vaccine substance maker like no that

2288.28 --> 2293.6800000000003
doesn't exist

2290.44 --> 2296.04
don't believe this [ __ ] don't be so

2293.68 --> 2296.04
cheap

2298.72 --> 2306.0989999999997
you can't have vaccine mosquitoes

2303.339 --> 2308.38
you can have parasite injecting

2306.099 --> 2311.38
mosquitoes you have them they're called

2308.38 --> 2313.839
malaria mosquitoes

2311.38 --> 2316.6600000000003
yeah but you can get rid of those by

2313.839 --> 2319.0
breeding sterile mosquitoes and then

2316.66 --> 2321.0989999999997
sending them among regions where the

2319.0 --> 2322.78
wrong type of mosquitoes like malaria

2321.099 --> 2324.339
are and then they'll die off again

2322.78 --> 2325.96
eventually

2324.339 --> 2327.82
that's how they do it they've been doing

2325.96 --> 2331.359
it for decades

2327.82 --> 2336.46
don't be afraid

2331.359 --> 2338.74
also malaria is very easily treated

2336.46 --> 2340.92
just don't let it Fester on when you get

2338.74 --> 2340.9199999999996
it

2343.14 --> 2348.52
but I mean you're when you get it you

2346.0 --> 2350.5
will figure it out because

2348.52 --> 2352.48
they could get like super diarrhea or

2350.5 --> 2354.4
something it's terrible I don't know I

2352.48 --> 2355.72
haven't really looked into it I don't

2354.4 --> 2358.119
want to know if

2355.72 --> 2360.04
some malaria here and let's hope it

2358.119 --> 2361.7200000000003
stays that way and Bill Gates isn't

2360.04 --> 2363.52
going to help us

2361.72 --> 2365.7
here in the Netherlands that would be

2363.52 --> 2365.7
great

2366.579 --> 2370.7200000000003
or Germany I hope Bill Gates isn't going

2369.099 --> 2373.7400000000002
to try to help Germany too because

2370.72 --> 2373.74
they're right next to us

2374.87 --> 2380.3199999999997
[Music]

2377.579 --> 2382.92
maybe they can help out certain regions

2380.32 --> 2382.92
in France

2383.2 --> 2389.7599999999998
I bet he'll want to help out there just

2386.98 --> 2389.76
for the fun of it

2399.9 --> 2403.32
hydroxyclocan that's right

2418.18 --> 2422.8199999999997
as Bill gets ever actually helped anyone

2423.599 --> 2426.599
all right

2426.76 --> 2431.26
well

2427.96 --> 2434.619
I think he's done a lot for the

2431.26 --> 2436.119
the population control Society the

2434.619 --> 2439.1400000000003
people that are into that yeah

2436.119 --> 2439.1400000000003
definitely help those

2439.359 --> 2445.839
right you give him money

2441.7 --> 2449.14
you get officially registered as being

2445.839 --> 2451.06
giving to charity and then he

2449.14 --> 2453.54
concocts ways to kill people

2451.06 --> 2456.2799999999997
[Music]

2453.54 --> 2458.2
I mean definitely people are being

2456.28 --> 2461.099
helped out

2458.2 --> 2461.0989999999997
by Bill Gates

2465.64 --> 2469.24
I mean he's basically just providing a

2467.859 --> 2471.7
service

2469.24 --> 2475.74
and that's it

2471.7 --> 2475.74
meat fire yeah viruses don't exist

2490.54 --> 2498.04
dudes tentacles are in there yeah

2494.2 --> 2501.7799999999997
because a lot of people are oblivious to

2498.04 --> 2501.7799999999997
or okay with what he does

2502.48 --> 2507.119
that's just how he works he's always

2504.4 --> 2507.119
worked like that

2507.28 --> 2511.98
I mean I knew he was [ __ ] up in the

2509.619 --> 2511.98
90s

2512.2 --> 2517.66
like even when I was kind of like sjw

2515.68 --> 2519.7
liberal

2517.66 --> 2521.3799999999997
not like I would harass people or

2519.7 --> 2522.8799999999997
something but I would be like on my high

2521.38 --> 2525.579
hours about it

2522.88 --> 2527.32
even then I knew like this guy is a

2525.579 --> 2530.6400000000003
[ __ ] demon

2527.32 --> 2530.6400000000003
like he's really sick

2531.94 --> 2536.92
like

2533.38 --> 2539.6800000000003
every time he he tries to act nice he's

2536.92 --> 2543.96
lying I could just tell every time he

2539.68 --> 2543.96
acted nice it was lies always

2544.119 --> 2549.88
never a genuine

2547.0 --> 2552.119
a genuine Communication in a positive

2549.88 --> 2552.119
sense

2554.619 --> 2558.7000000000003
and I knew that as a as a stupid

2556.839 --> 2561.94
ignorant liberal

2558.7 --> 2564.04
not yeah stupid and why it's foolish

2561.94 --> 2566.68
Libra because I've always been smart but

2564.04 --> 2569.079
I've not been very wise

2566.68 --> 2571.0
not capable of handling the truth right

2569.079 --> 2572.8
yeah you can figure out the true yeah

2571.0 --> 2573.88
but can you handle the truth yeah that's

2572.8 --> 2576.099
the issue

2573.88 --> 2578.56
oh I could figure out the truth but it

2576.099 --> 2582.0
wasn't very good at handling it

2578.56 --> 2582.0
in a lifelong theme

2582.839 --> 2588.33
I'm getting there though

2586.599 --> 2592.179
took me damn long enough

2588.33 --> 2592.179
[Music]

2601.66 --> 2605.44
two gates the most evil person that ever

2604.24 --> 2608.56
to live

2605.44 --> 2611.339
who cares what you wanna put him give

2608.56 --> 2611.339
him a trophy

2612.88 --> 2617.339
I mean just be glad when he's finally

2615.099 --> 2617.339
gone

2619.359 --> 2624.4
I mean that's that's the worst you could

2621.16 --> 2627.2799999999997
do to him is like not care don't engage

2624.4 --> 2629.14
and then when he dies just move on don't

2627.28 --> 2631.0
even why would you even be happy it's

2629.14 --> 2632.7999999999997
just like ah finally over and we can

2631.0 --> 2634.839
finally move on

2632.8 --> 2637.3
aren't you just sick of that guy why

2634.839 --> 2639.94
would you give any

2637.3 --> 2642.1600000000003
any kind of feelings towards him I mean

2639.94 --> 2644.5
he is gonna die and I mean his whole

2642.16 --> 2648.16
life is already hell

2644.5 --> 2652.24
I mean it's a guy that never gives any

2648.16 --> 2652.24
genuine positive communication

2652.78 --> 2657.7000000000003
only a person that literally their

2655.54 --> 2661.319
Consciousness lives in hell

2657.7 --> 2661.319
could be like that so

2662.56 --> 2668.44
he's gets the worst of it

2665.92 --> 2671.079
right you got to realize that hell is

2668.44 --> 2674.079
going to reach into his dreams

2671.079 --> 2676.0600000000004
all the Lucid stuff any internal

2674.079 --> 2678.1600000000003
experience is going to be hell with him

2676.06 --> 2679.66
if he even has any more internal

2678.16 --> 2682.0
experience if he didn't like medically

2679.66 --> 2683.98
cut that off or something

2682.0 --> 2686.4
because he looks like a guy that might

2683.98 --> 2686.4
have like

2686.859 --> 2691.66
chemically lobotomized himself to no

2689.56 --> 2694.02
longer feel pain or something he looks

2691.66 --> 2694.02
like that

2697.119 --> 2700.92
you don't want to be him guys

2719.02 --> 2722.38
that's right steemitary yeah that's my

2720.7 --> 2725.7999999999997
attitude just ignore him I mean I don't

2722.38 --> 2727.9
talk about Bill Gates all the time

2725.8 --> 2729.94
and I have a personal beef with him

2727.9 --> 2733.38
because I consider him the guy that

2729.94 --> 2733.38
actually destroyed amiga

2733.42 --> 2738.579
although technically Amiga did that from

2736.359 --> 2740.56
the inside with their stupid idiotic

2738.579 --> 2742.6600000000003
game console idea which was the worst

2740.56 --> 2746.64
ever

2742.66 --> 2746.64
to just progress with what they had

2747.0 --> 2750.94
gained like just enhance the Amiga

2749.98 --> 2753.22
itself

2750.94 --> 2755.079
don't go to [ __ ] console that was

2753.22 --> 2757.359
like the worst decision ever and the

2755.079 --> 2759.52
games really were [ __ ]

2757.359 --> 2762.0989999999997
I've seen them reviewed Angry Video Game

2759.52 --> 2763.359
Nerd there's not even that many of them

2762.099 --> 2766.3590000000004
but I mean

2763.359 --> 2770.98
I still blame Bill Gates because he was

2766.359 --> 2770.98
just ruining a whole bunch of innovative

2771.339 --> 2775.359
software

2773.079 --> 2777.4
Developers

2775.359 --> 2779.92
like all over the place he would just

2777.4 --> 2781.96
buy things up projects He would buy them

2779.92 --> 2784.96
up and then just

2781.96 --> 2787.3
disband it

2784.96 --> 2790.06
like forbid programmers to keep working

2787.3 --> 2792.94
on it it was a saboteur it was a

2790.06 --> 2795.7599999999998
saboteur to the software World terrible

2792.94 --> 2799.78
terrible influence

2795.76 --> 2802.78
[Music]

2799.78 --> 2802.78
foreign

2806.14 --> 2811.18
skimmed off the top of the entire golden

2809.079 --> 2813.7000000000003
age of programming

2811.18 --> 2816.16
he like destroyed that Golden Age

2813.7 --> 2817.72
partially he ruined it

2816.16 --> 2820.359
if Bill Gates wouldn't have been there

2817.72 --> 2822.339
like programming would be computer

2820.359 --> 2825.06
programming would have been completely

2822.339 --> 2825.06
different now

2825.16 --> 2830.859
and errors probably would have been come

2827.859 --> 2834.88
a complete thing of the past

2830.859 --> 2837.7599999999998
and not be standardized to make you keep

2834.88 --> 2839.6800000000003
upgrading to keep you on the hook that's

2837.76 --> 2844.079
something that effectively Bill Gates

2839.68 --> 2844.0789999999997
introduced into the software world

2846.819 --> 2852.54
it's the thing that initially everybody

2848.859 --> 2852.54
hated Microsoft for

2853.24 --> 2860.02
and then they became better

2856.48 --> 2862.96
and it's decent and then every [ __ ]

2860.02 --> 2865.8
body started doing that [ __ ]

2862.96 --> 2865.8
Apple

2866.02 --> 2870.52
yeah and those all those bastards that

2868.72 --> 2872.22
started doing that they all Rose to the

2870.52 --> 2876.04
top

2872.22 --> 2879.339
Bill Gates started it he ruined

2876.04 --> 2882.94
the software golden age

2879.339 --> 2886.7799999999997
and I yeah as somebody who apparently

2882.94 --> 2888.819
cares about that I find that like I take

2886.78 --> 2891.46
that very personal that's what I like

2888.819 --> 2894.7599999999998
really hate him for because

2891.46 --> 2896.92
I was into that I was into like

2894.76 --> 2899.38
programming or rather people that were

2896.92 --> 2901.7200000000003
into programming I was into them and

2899.38 --> 2903.76
very curious as to like what they were

2901.72 --> 2906.64
doing and ideas and I would like try to

2903.76 --> 2908.3190000000004
give them right because it's like fresh

2906.64 --> 2910.2999999999997
ground they're working on fresh ground

2908.319 --> 2912.819
thinking new Concepts and I would be

2910.3 --> 2914.38
like I don't I'm not a programmer but

2912.819 --> 2916.42
I've heard a lot of pro and I could

2914.38 --> 2917.6800000000003
maybe lift give them a good suggestion

2916.42 --> 2920.38
here and there

2917.68 --> 2923.2
and it actually worked out here and

2920.38 --> 2927.04
there that ik programmer suggestions

2923.2 --> 2930.7
about how to program things and

2927.04 --> 2932.14
that they really were glad off that they

2930.7 --> 2934.18
were held they thought that was helpful

2932.14 --> 2936.7799999999997
when I'm not a programmer okay I'm very

2934.18 --> 2936.7799999999997
proud of that

2936.819 --> 2944.819
and Bill Gates ruined that ground for me

2940.599 --> 2944.819
he poisoned that ground

2946.48 --> 2950.64
I take that very [ __ ] personal

2967.42 --> 2973.38
okay steam traveler that's hilarious no

2969.819 --> 2973.38

2978.099 --> 2980.28
think

2983.5 --> 2985.98
anyway

2986.619 --> 2991.1800000000003
Linux is the way to yeah I know I've

2989.079 --> 2993.2200000000003
heard Linux has become a lot better I

2991.18 --> 2995.3799999999997
mean I'm just sticking to Microsoft

2993.22 --> 2997.06
because I mean it still works if it's

2995.38 --> 3000.599
not gonna work anymore

2997.06 --> 3003.74
and I'll stop using it

3000.599 --> 3003.7400000000002
it's still working

3015.66 --> 3018.3799999999997

then

3653.46 --> 3658.5

3655.859 --> 3661.2
I'm not gonna drink

3658.5 --> 3663.96
all right

3661.2 --> 3666.72
I think that I've been doing much much

3663.96 --> 3670.02
better overall on my shows

3666.72 --> 3672.299
since I completely quit drinking to me

3670.02 --> 3675.5
it's palpable

do they have any map

3799.98 --> 3804.96

3802.079 --> 3806.46
okay well the link that they're using as

3804.96 --> 3810.02
a source

3806.46 --> 3810.02
doesn't exist apparently

3811.44 --> 3815.0
so I don't know about this

3824.48 --> 3830.28
right there I quit drinking yeah Mark I

3827.819 --> 3832.5589999999997
mean it was very pleasurable while while

3830.28 --> 3834.119
I was doing I will never be like oh I

3832.559 --> 3836.2200000000003
don't want to do it I gotta drink

3834.119 --> 3838.5
because I'm in no no no if I'm gonna

3836.22 --> 3841.0789999999997
drink I'm gonna have fun with it

3838.5 --> 3842.94
problem was that well I'd been drinking

3841.079 --> 3844.619
for a while and it just the ratio

3842.94 --> 3847.079
between

3844.619 --> 3851.52
for the fun of it

3847.079 --> 3854.28
and the detriments it was getting it was

3851.52 --> 3856.7
giving me was just like it was no longer

3854.28 --> 3856.7000000000003
worth it

3856.92 --> 3862.859
I barely felt it when I was taking it

3859.74 --> 3867.3799999999997
what I would have like just an overall

3862.859 --> 3867.38
downgrade of my energy output

3875.099 --> 3878.119
and had more moments where I would be

3877.2 --> 3881.339
like

3878.119 --> 3883.319
sickish but not like a hangover sick as

3881.339 --> 3885.48
you know it's just like my system just

3883.319 --> 3888.7799999999997
just was burden overall

3885.48 --> 3891.18
made me feel more feeble

3888.78 --> 3892.5
to my innards it's just what did what it

3891.18 --> 3895.3999999999996
did

3892.5 --> 3895.4
eventually

3899.22 --> 3903.74
and I haven't had that issue since I

3901.5 --> 3903.74
quit

3907.2 --> 3911.04
of course the coffee

3909.42 --> 3913.7400000000002
yeah but I don't think you're gonna get

3911.04 --> 3916.579
corsicos disease from just drinking beer

3913.74 --> 3916.5789999999997

3958.5 --> 3966.359
vitamin deficiency nah

3962.22 --> 3968.8799999999997
it's the same root as as sugar addiction

3966.359 --> 3971.5989999999997
alcoholism is basically another form of

3968.88 --> 3971.599
sugar addiction

3984.299 --> 3986.72

[Music]

4005.27 --> 4008.469
[Music]

4040.819 --> 4046.7599999999998
yeah but more colored I mean

4043.76 --> 4048.92
you basically get it from always having

4046.76 --> 4051.26
alcohol in your system if you are like a

4048.92 --> 4054.5
chain Drinker you wake up in the morning

4051.26 --> 4056.2400000000002
and you make take a shot

4054.5 --> 4059.359
right

4056.24 --> 4063.339
because then your body just doesn't have

4059.359 --> 4063.339
enough time to restore itself

4063.799 --> 4068.5389999999998
is keeping yourself bro if like

4066.4 --> 4070.76
physiologically it's not even mentally

4068.539 --> 4074.38
or like the triple it's just that your

4070.76 --> 4074.38
body just never gets a break

4075.559 --> 4079.46
it's gonna destabilize your overall

4077.359 --> 4081.5
metabolism and yeah it's gonna lead to

4079.46 --> 4084.14
that kind of thing it's like your body

4081.5 --> 4086.839
literally doesn't have time

4084.14 --> 4090.74
to basically be done with the cleaning

4086.839 --> 4093.859
up phase in order to get to the build or

4090.74 --> 4096.5
like regenerate yourself right it

4093.859 --> 4098.54
doesn't have enough time for that

4096.5 --> 4100.88
and that's how you get things like

4098.54 --> 4103.46
karsikov and

4100.88 --> 4105.38
liver cirrhosis

4103.46 --> 4108.52
just never get a break

4105.38 --> 4108.52
and you don't eat well

4117.739 --> 4122.0
yeah Divergent then

4119.839 --> 4126.8189999999995
maybe that but

4122.0 --> 4126.819
it breaks down in your body into sugar

4127.94 --> 4130.839
and other stuff

4131.359 --> 4140.56
so to your body the addiction part is

4135.4 --> 4140.5599999999995
extremely similar to sugar addiction

4140.96 --> 4145.339
now the actual effect on your

4143.299 --> 4147.38
physiologically might be very different

4145.339 --> 4152.0199999999995
even a different pace

4147.38 --> 4152.02
right alcohol lasts usually longer

4156.799 --> 4160.46
because yeah or we're going to wait the

4158.6 --> 4163.88
other way around like sugar tends to

4160.46 --> 4167.66
last longer and alcohol

4163.88 --> 4170.66
just makes like a big impact on your

4167.66 --> 4170.66
perception

4171.259 --> 4176.66
sugar just amps up the

4173.96 --> 4181.12
the energy level

4176.66 --> 4181.12
in a dirty way it's a dirty energy

4181.46 --> 4184.64
she ever feeds cancer yeah it feeds

4183.56 --> 4187.279
fungi

4184.64 --> 4190.719
in your body

4187.279 --> 4190.719
it's called again uh

4193.64 --> 4201.58
candida it feeds Canada and candida yeah

4198.56 --> 4206.1990000000005
when you get a lot of it it basically

4201.58 --> 4206.199
then starts to cause cancer

4212.199 --> 4218.66
that's a typical side yeah or at least

4215.66 --> 4220.58
it's correlated that you could really

4218.66 --> 4222.38
say that

4220.58 --> 4226.58
because I mean what the hell even is

4222.38 --> 4228.38
cancer it's like a bodily mechanism so

4226.58 --> 4231.92
but I mean

4228.38 --> 4235.54
it is a go-to question like

4231.92 --> 4235.54
what's the candida level

4241.64 --> 4248.179
right so you can't really really say the

4245.12 --> 4250.599999999999
cause but the correlation is definitely

4248.179 --> 4250.6
there

4258.14 --> 4263.6
Joker substitutes are what yeah

4261.8 --> 4268.12
absolutely mark

4263.6 --> 4270.679
but I mean sugar substitutes are all

4268.12 --> 4273.199
non-organic substances

4270.679 --> 4275.36
except for Stevia Stevia is the only

4273.199 --> 4277.12
sugar substitute that's actually natural

4275.36 --> 4280.839999999999
and

4277.12 --> 4280.84
considerably more healthy

4281.0 --> 4285.56
if you like the taste of it I'm not a

4283.1 --> 4287.96
big fan really but I'm I'm overall low

4285.56 --> 4291.620000000001
sugar anyway I I don't need like the

4287.96 --> 4293.96
sweet taste I don't want it anymore

4291.62 --> 4295.76
I was a huge sugar addict when I was

4293.96 --> 4298.719
younger but I just

4295.76 --> 4298.719
I don't want it anymore

4299.179 --> 4304.179
makes me like too sweet makes me

4301.28 --> 4304.179
nauseated now

4308.06 --> 4312.02
it's I think it's just because I got rid

4310.1 --> 4314.2390000000005
of the candida I mean if you don't have

4312.02 --> 4317.179
candida in your body anymore you don't

4314.239 --> 4319.699
get that like yeah sugar

4317.179 --> 4324.4400000000005
you don't have that tendency anymore

4319.699 --> 4328.36
it's now it's just like oh too sweet

4324.44 --> 4328.36
that's now how I am

4329.42 --> 4332.569
[Music]

4333.98 --> 4339.0199999999995
and if I do actually like start chugging

4336.92 --> 4340.219
something that's really sweet like

4339.02 --> 4342.38
cake

4340.219 --> 4345.02
or something right usually kind of sweet

4342.38 --> 4347.84
and like too much of it dude I start to

4345.02 --> 4350.8
feel it like in my

4347.84 --> 4350.8
foreign

4364.14 --> 4369.6990000000005
[Music]

4365.9 --> 4369.699
pancreas that's the one

4370.219 --> 4374.659
I do feel it like immediately there so

4372.5 --> 4376.96
I'm like yeah I really I just gotta be

4374.659 --> 4376.96
careful

4377.96 --> 4383.179
because I feel like if I would have live

4381.26 --> 4386.12
and lived a life where I would just

4383.179 --> 4388.9400000000005
continually indulge in sugar

4386.12 --> 4391.179
I would probably be completely diabetic

4388.94 --> 4391.178999999999
now

4391.64 --> 4396.38
and I was in a way like beard just

4395.3 --> 4401.62
worked out

4396.38 --> 4401.62
but at times it did feel like oh

4402.26 --> 4408.92
maybe I should stop right and then I did

4405.92 --> 4410.659
and now that [ __ ] has stopped so it was

4408.92 --> 4413.36
like on the edge

4410.659 --> 4415.339999999999
like alcohol is just not good for me

4413.36 --> 4417.62
anymore

4415.34 --> 4419.659000000001
I could maybe take it here and there but

4417.62 --> 4421.04
it probably would be sorry about it the

4419.659 --> 4424.839999999999
next day anyway

4421.04 --> 4424.84
I don't want to be that anymore

4426.86 --> 4431.659
and also I just want a girl to like me

4429.56 --> 4434.179
sober and I want to like her sober

4431.659 --> 4438.099999999999
that's what I want and if that's really

4434.179 --> 4438.1
hard to find well the tough luck

4459.739 --> 4464.98
you can think of quitting Europe

4462.38 --> 4464.9800000000005
okay

4474.679 --> 4479.3
uh herb seems to be just fine with me

4477.98 --> 4481.699
I mean

4479.3 --> 4485.38
without the alcohol I literally feel

4481.699 --> 4485.379999999999
like nothing is growing worse

4488.659 --> 4494.9
all I have to really do is keep avoiding

4491.84 --> 4497.78
demoralizing things

4494.9 --> 4499.82
not denying them but like avoiding them

4497.78 --> 4503.78
If you deny them you just get obsessed

4499.82 --> 4507.199
with it anyway and then it wins anyway

4503.78 --> 4510.739
but just avoid terrible things

4507.199 --> 4513.139999999999
and then I'm like I seem to just be

4510.739 --> 4515.599999999999
regenerating more and more I seem to

4513.14 --> 4519.400000000001
only get better like I'm in pretty good

4515.6 --> 4519.400000000001
shape even if you see me

4519.679 --> 4523.96
much better than three years ago

4531.199 --> 4534.94
than to use more than you need to

4535.58 --> 4542.26
get that yeah it's like oh well that's

4538.46 --> 4542.26
just you're smoking it too strong then

4542.42 --> 4545.14
right

4554.659 --> 4560.199
it does kind of make some people slow

4557.54 --> 4560.199
yeah

4578.54 --> 4581.84
part of the quick tour and alcohol then

4580.4 --> 4584.5
tobacco

4581.84 --> 4584.5
hmm

4593.0 --> 4598.3
no I wouldn't say so well for me

4599.12 --> 4603.0199999999995
I mean the sugar addiction was much more

4601.76 --> 4605.54
brutal

4603.02 --> 4607.88
when I was younger

4605.54 --> 4608.9
but it really kind of went away as I

4607.88 --> 4611.56
grew over

4608.9 --> 4611.5599999999995
like that

4616.34 --> 4622.46
I made an active job when I went organic

4619.3 --> 4625.46
to like get sugar out of my diet and I

4622.46 --> 4627.92
did and it worked out just fine

4625.46 --> 4630.8
it's much better

4627.92 --> 4633.08
what I mean tobacco is more difficult

4630.8 --> 4636.7390000000005
because

4633.08 --> 4640.58
it like touches me in a spiritual way

4636.739 --> 4643.879999999999
too that has certain advantages that I

4640.58 --> 4646.949
don't get when I don't smoke

4643.88 --> 4646.9490000000005
[Music]

4647.86 --> 4653.179
and I definitely noticed the difference

4650.6 --> 4657.280000000001
when I was with my ex because I was not

4653.179 --> 4657.28
smoking tobacco when I was with her

4662.179 --> 4665.56
I had just quit

4667.34 --> 4674.96
and yeah I didn't smoke for like

4671.84 --> 4676.88
what is it four or five years

4674.96 --> 4678.92
like even after we broke up I didn't

4676.88 --> 4682.04
start smoking again

4678.92 --> 4685.28
I really started smoking tobacco again

4682.04 --> 4687.679
after a while here

4685.28 --> 4691.4
because I started noticing that just

4687.679 --> 4693.1990000000005
smoking cannabis raw was just not doing

4691.4 --> 4696.44
it it was making me kind of feel

4693.199 --> 4698.48
[ __ ] that's the problem with it when

4696.44 --> 4702.259999999999
I smoked it with tobacco it doesn't make

4698.48 --> 4704.839999999999
me feel [ __ ] when I smoke is pure it

4702.26 --> 4708.58
always does that and it I I find that

4704.84 --> 4708.58
quite a repulsive sensation

4709.76 --> 4714.92
and I forget about it forget about that

4712.76 --> 4716.54
that happens until I take a hit from

4714.92 --> 4719.62
like a bong or something and it's like

4716.54 --> 4719.62
oh yeah

4719.92 --> 4723.52
I didn't like that

4728.9 --> 4732.92
cigarettes give my teeth a handsome

4731.12 --> 4734.78
Brown does it though

4732.92 --> 4736.46
does it

4734.78 --> 4739.599999999999
really

4736.46 --> 4739.6
I don't think so

4739.82 --> 4745.54
not Brown

4741.8 --> 4745.54
excuse the salad between my teeth

4755.42 --> 4760.88
yeah no it doesn't do that if you use

4759.02 --> 4764.0
these things

4760.88 --> 4767.06
and yeah it costs a little extra

4764.0 --> 4769.94
little carbon filters it does cost a

4767.06 --> 4772.179
little extra what it is very well worth

4769.94 --> 4772.178999999999
it

4772.4 --> 4779.48
it tastes much better like it's smoking

4776.9 --> 4781.339999999999
a lot better than just a stupid paper

4779.48 --> 4785.239
tip thingy

4781.34 --> 4789.88
I mean it is another level

4785.239 --> 4789.879999999999
I like it more than like vaping

4800.48 --> 4803.739
no smelling breath

4803.96 --> 4806.5
yep

4809.719 --> 4813.1
well done what

4818.48 --> 4822.919999999999
do we watch yeah yeah no you don't die

4821.0 --> 4827.12
clammy

4822.92 --> 4831.7390000000005
yeah you know that there's Indonesians

4827.12 --> 4834.5599999999995
I think it's still there's Indonesians

4831.739 --> 4838.459999999999
that are over a hundred

4834.56 --> 4841.360000000001
and they still smoke every day yeah

4838.46 --> 4841.36
climbing

4843.86 --> 4847.54
smoking doesn't kill you

4848.12 --> 4852.8
and it doesn't actually directly create

4851.179 --> 4857.42
cancer like that

4852.8 --> 4861.1990000000005
but if you accompany the smoking or you

4857.42 --> 4863.12
smoke in a bad way or you dwell upon bad

4861.199 --> 4865.58
feelings while smoking

4863.12 --> 4867.62
or you have a lot of situations in your

4865.58 --> 4870.26
life where you're continually escaping

4867.62 --> 4873.62
from it like I gotta go to smoke to get

4870.26 --> 4876.4400000000005
out of the way you bad smoking yeah then

4873.62 --> 4879.94
it will have negative influence on you

4876.44 --> 4879.94
it will be like a crutch

4880.699 --> 4886.639999999999
but if you just

4883.219 --> 4887.9
have a great life and you eat well and

4886.64 --> 4890.3
you're wise and you're good with

4887.9 --> 4892.639999999999
everybody and you you live with God

4890.3 --> 4895.88
you're very like you face everything you

4892.64 --> 4898.6990000000005
face your sins Etc and you're a smoker

4895.88 --> 4901.82
yeah it's you can live very long

4898.699 --> 4907.178999999999
and it's weird because even my dad tells

4901.82 --> 4907.179
me that okay and my dad quit smoking

4908.9 --> 4915.379999999999
you quit smoking like 10 years ago

4912.739 --> 4918.86
and sometimes I'm like oh I'm worried

4915.38 --> 4920.659000000001
that why didn't I just not why did I

4918.86 --> 4922.46
start smoking again I can never get rid

4920.659 --> 4925.759999999999
of it I'm afraid that I might get and

4922.46 --> 4928.28
then he literally says to me like no no

4925.76 --> 4931.64
don't fall for that [ __ ] it doesn't

4928.28 --> 4934.239
kill you you don't get cancer from

4931.64 --> 4934.2390000000005
smoking

4934.46 --> 4940.34
that's just propaganda [ __ ]

4938.0 --> 4943.96
there's people over 100 years old that

4940.34 --> 4943.96
are still smoking every day

4953.12 --> 4958.599999999999
are the ladies attracted to this one I

4955.34 --> 4958.6
don't give a [ __ ] glammy

4958.76 --> 4962.360000000001
okay

4959.96 --> 4964.96
maybe you should stop being so [ __ ]

4962.36 --> 4964.96
invasive

4979.1 --> 4984.26
yeah maybe I am just gonna do whatever

4981.62 --> 4986.54
the [ __ ] I'm gonna do and I'm not gonna

4984.26 --> 4988.64
change anything

4986.54 --> 4992.92
about what I do

4988.64 --> 4992.92
because I want to attract a female

4995.96 --> 4999.62
maybe I'm just gonna do what I'm gonna

4997.88 --> 5002.26
do

4999.62 --> 5004.739
and become better at it have more of a

5002.26 --> 5007.4800000000005
manifestation I don't want to start

5004.739 --> 5009.459999999999
rearranging my life and how I do things

5007.48 --> 5013.12
just to get a spouse you know what you

5009.46 --> 5016.4800000000005
end up like when you do that a [ __ ]

5013.12 --> 5018.78
I don't want to be a [ __ ] husband you

5016.48 --> 5018.78
understand

5023.38 --> 5027.1
you worry about well if you worry so

5025.42 --> 5028.4800000000005
much about me why don't you just send me

5027.1 --> 5032.52
a PayPal then

5028.48 --> 5032.5199999999995
yeah that actually helps

5035.02 --> 5040.7390000000005
I'm not gonna be molded into some cocky

5037.96 --> 5040.7390000000005
husband yeah

5042.13 --> 5048.400000000001
[Music]

5045.34 --> 5049.6
I mean I tried that already as far as I

5048.4 --> 5052.0
could

5049.6 --> 5054.34
and still maintaining some level of

5052.0 --> 5056.14
dignity while doing it with my ex yeah

5054.34 --> 5061.14
and that didn't work

5056.14 --> 5061.14
I'm not gonna be some [ __ ] slave

5061.96 --> 5064.9800000000005
I'm a man

5074.44 --> 5078.688999999999
oh

5075.56 --> 5078.689
[Music]

5091.239 --> 5095.739
yeah because men that do that oh they

5094.12 --> 5098.62
adapt

5095.739 --> 5100.718999999999
yeah they all turn into [ __ ] husbands

5098.62 --> 5103.239
all of them

5100.719 --> 5107.56
thank you

5103.239 --> 5110.98
yeah and then if they're halfway unlucky

5107.56 --> 5114.64
then their freaking wives also make them

5110.98 --> 5117.94
blurt out stupid feminist lies on top of

5114.64 --> 5119.92
that yeah that's never going to [ __ ]

5117.94 --> 5125.46
happen with me

5119.92 --> 5125.46
I'd rather die alone and single

5129.02 --> 5132.169000000001
[Music]

5137.02 --> 5143.02
[Music]

5139.02 --> 5145.3
yeah and want to help me out get a woman

5143.02 --> 5148.42
help me get an income

5145.3 --> 5151.02
yeah that's how you get a woman you get

5148.42 --> 5151.02
an income

5151.719 --> 5156.88
that's how you get the women that

5154.54 --> 5160.84
actually want to procreate yeah I don't

5156.88 --> 5163.659000000001
need a squirt partner yeah I don't need

5160.84 --> 5167.62
a girl that just wants to be [ __ ] I

5163.659 --> 5171.0
don't give a [ __ ] literally yeah I

5167.62 --> 5175.0599999999995
literally don't give [ __ ]

5171.0 --> 5177.82
I want marriage a woman that's going to

5175.06 --> 5182.080000000001
stay with me that's gonna be loyal to me

5177.82 --> 5186.0
and what I do and wants kids

5182.08 --> 5188.92
and wants like me to raise them in a

5186.0 --> 5192.06
non-liberal way

5188.92 --> 5195.639
and that will like fight and potentially

5192.06 --> 5196.780000000001
bleed alongside me to defend our

5195.639 --> 5201.9400000000005
children

5196.78 --> 5203.62
from this [ __ ] up lgbtq influence

5201.94 --> 5206.919999999999
yeah

5203.62 --> 5209.38
you don't do that by amending your way

5206.92 --> 5212.32
so that some females might find you more

5209.38 --> 5214.179
attractive no you do that by getting a

5212.32 --> 5217.0
[ __ ] income

5214.179 --> 5220.8
all right so you wanna really help me

5217.0 --> 5220.8
out donate to my PayPal

5221.679 --> 5226.96
yeah this is not a little trick

5225.04 --> 5228.699
twisting the words around to make it

5226.96 --> 5230.08
about donating to me no this is

5228.699 --> 5232.5
literally true

5230.08 --> 5237.82
yeah

5232.5 --> 5241.3
success it was is what actually attracts

5237.82 --> 5244.84
females that want to appropriate

5241.3 --> 5246.6990000000005
yeah not adapting to be more likable

5244.84 --> 5249.34
yeah

5246.699 --> 5250.96
women don't want to procreate with men

5249.34 --> 5253.3
that are likable

5250.96 --> 5257.76
they want to procreate men that are sick

5253.3 --> 5257.76
with men that are successful and badass

5258.04 --> 5262.8
and that will not be manipulated by them

5273.4 --> 5279.46
so thanks for the try but

5277.239 --> 5281.739
a traditional view of Mary yeah that's

5279.46 --> 5285.159
right you better [ __ ] believe it I

5281.739 --> 5288.54
mean I I've given squirts okay I've

5285.159 --> 5288.54
knife given [ __ ]

5288.58 --> 5292.84
in the hopes that at the end of the

5290.92 --> 5295.3
right they would like

5292.84 --> 5297.34
have a bond with me and then go for it

5295.3 --> 5300.639
yeah that didn't work

5297.34 --> 5303.04
ended up that they would just use me

5300.639 --> 5305.1990000000005
because I'm really good at sex because

5303.04 --> 5308.44
of my empathy power and when I'm in love

5305.199 --> 5310.839999999999
it is it is divine

5308.44 --> 5314.32
and for females only

5310.84 --> 5317.679
but I'm not giving it anymore

5314.32 --> 5320.62
unless they actually want to have

5317.679 --> 5324.2390000000005
children and want to face off against

5320.62 --> 5324.239
the system with me

5325.0 --> 5330.82
and I'm actually considering making

5327.94 --> 5333.04
women sign a contract on that

5330.82 --> 5335.759999999999
although that would basically be like a

5333.04 --> 5335.76
marriage contract

5337.179 --> 5340.26
so yeah

5340.36 --> 5344.98
I mean

5342.76 --> 5346.84
I'm not saying that I would like never

5344.98 --> 5349.178999999999
have sex before marriage or anything

5346.84 --> 5352.1990000000005
because there is something like there's

5349.179 --> 5352.1990000000005
something alchemical

5352.659 --> 5357.28
where you really know where you're gonna

5354.82 --> 5358.719
be at with each other after you had sex

5357.28 --> 5361.42
for the first time that's like when you

5358.719 --> 5362.9800000000005
get to know each other in a way at least

5361.42 --> 5365.1990000000005
I do

5362.98 --> 5366.459999999999
it's like after having sex you know if

5365.199 --> 5368.5599999999995
you want to be around that person

5366.46 --> 5370.6
because that might literally just go

5368.56 --> 5373.84
away after you first had sex

5370.6 --> 5376.0
so I would try that out I'm not like oh

5373.84 --> 5378.82
no we're gonna get married first and

5376.0 --> 5380.92
then sex for the first time no no

5378.82 --> 5383.86
don't worry about that

5380.92 --> 5386.5
but I'm not in it for the squirt

5383.86 --> 5390.4
it's not like oh yeah here it comes oh

5386.5 --> 5392.139
yeah sex every time yeah no no no no no

5390.4 --> 5395.04
I'll have sex to know if we're

5392.139 --> 5395.04
compatible or not

5397.54 --> 5404.26
and then I'd like to redirect all that

5400.659 --> 5408.4
horniness and that energy and

5404.26 --> 5412.5
to actually try to become productive and

5408.4 --> 5412.5
form a family Spirit together

5413.08 --> 5417.3
to get into that that's what I want to

5414.88 --> 5417.3
do now

5418.84 --> 5423.82
yeah women like money but it's not about

5421.3 --> 5426.900000000001
the money or the material spending it's

5423.82 --> 5426.9
about safety

5427.719 --> 5435.639
yeah money means a fortress A Safe Keep

5434.02 --> 5437.9800000000005
that's what it effectively means

5435.639 --> 5440.5
somebody with money if everything blows

5437.98 --> 5442.599999999999
up they can run together and with the

5440.5 --> 5445.739
kids and have everything left behind

5442.6 --> 5445.7390000000005
without worries

5446.26 --> 5450.639
and then literally like from one moment

5448.9 --> 5453.879999999999
to another just get a new house just

5450.639 --> 5457.900000000001
like that like that's safety yeah that's

5453.88 --> 5460.6
why women even women that want children

5457.9 --> 5463.12
want a guy that has money because it's

5460.6 --> 5465.820000000001
safety it's security

5463.12 --> 5467.62
it's logical it's not because oh I just

5465.82 --> 5470.44
want to spend all this I just want to be

5467.62 --> 5472.659
rich and now those women that are like

5470.44 --> 5476.339999999999
that they don't want kids they just want

5472.659 --> 5476.339999999999
to live a luxurious life

5479.8 --> 5483.4800000000005
you'll find out soon enough

5490.5 --> 5494.62
Material Girl right so yeah I do know

5493.6 --> 5497.92
some

5494.62 --> 5500.8
of a few things about this sort of thing

5497.92 --> 5504.36
I am not a virgin guys I hope that's

5500.8 --> 5504.360000000001
kind of cleared up now

5504.58 --> 5508.84
there's still trolls out there that like

5506.44 --> 5511.659
to say that kind of nonsense

5508.84 --> 5514.96
but I mean I definitely know some things

5511.659 --> 5514.96
about relationships

5521.8 --> 5526.659000000001
that's how you met your ex-fiance well

5524.62 --> 5529.5599999999995
how did that work out with your

5526.659 --> 5529.5599999999995
ex-fiance

5537.82 --> 5541.719
sounds more like somebody you had sex

5539.739 --> 5543.759999999999
with and they just hung around because

5541.719 --> 5546.06
they're obviously not your fiance

5543.76 --> 5546.06
anymore

5551.08 --> 5555.96
not a relationship is like a long-term

5553.42 --> 5555.96
dedication

5558.94 --> 5563.4
it's not just hanging around with sex

5564.71 --> 5567.92
[Music]

5570.4 --> 5574.54
yeah if you want a relationship that

5572.32 --> 5578.32
lasts do another base it on sex right

5574.54 --> 5580.12
let it let sex not be the

5578.32 --> 5582.04
the ultimate thing within the

5580.12 --> 5584.98
relationship don't let it have the

5582.04 --> 5587.739
primary place of attention

5584.98 --> 5589.54
make the sex secondary and yeah it will

5587.739 --> 5592.239
last

5589.54 --> 5594.04
because if you if you give it everything

5592.239 --> 5596.799999999999
the sex part

5594.04 --> 5599.739
then you will reach Peaks that will

5596.8 --> 5601.900000000001
absolutely inevitably die down

5599.739 --> 5604.0
but your addiction to it will not die

5601.9 --> 5607.0
down and then you'll grow either more

5604.0 --> 5609.46
perverse together and enter the darkness

5607.0 --> 5611.32
or you basically she doesn't do it for

5609.46 --> 5613.659
you anymore and then you probably will

5611.32 --> 5616.96
go cheating on somebody else and and

5613.659 --> 5618.5199999999995
start that cycle over again

5616.96 --> 5622.12
right

5618.52 --> 5624.580000000001
so yeah don't let sex be the primary

5622.12 --> 5626.8
factor in your relationship and that's a

5624.58 --> 5629.0199999999995
mistake I kind of made with my ex even

5626.8 --> 5630.820000000001
though I really didn't put sex in the

5629.02 --> 5633.820000000001
first place she did

5630.82 --> 5635.86
and I thought that was really cool

5633.82 --> 5637.54
I mean it is it does make you feel

5635.86 --> 5639.4
really badass when a girl just

5637.54 --> 5641.5199999999995
continually wants sex with you and all

5639.4 --> 5641.5199999999995
that

5641.98 --> 5651.0599999999995
so it was very good for my ego

5646.3 --> 5651.06
and she is unbelievably gorgeous

5658.179 --> 5666.36
but yeah she did not plan to actually

5662.679 --> 5666.36
live with me forever

5669.46 --> 5674.28
then I refuse to accept that

5675.04 --> 5678.82
and then yeah well I don't want to get

5677.199 --> 5681.638999999999
into the

5678.82 --> 5685.0599999999995
the depressing latter part of the

5681.639 --> 5685.06
relationship anyway

5693.159 --> 5700.12
relationship last it's based on sex

5697.02 --> 5702.820000000001
if it's just sex and they don't actually

5700.12 --> 5704.82
like you as a person yeah that's

5702.82 --> 5708.42
terrible

5704.82 --> 5708.42
terrible for you

5709.659 --> 5713.98
that's like somebody just trying to

5712.3 --> 5716.08
harvest you

5713.98 --> 5718.299999999999
like an animal

5716.08 --> 5720.34
makes you feel very indignified

5718.3 --> 5723.76
afterward

5720.34 --> 5725.8
so now you know what it's like how some

5723.76 --> 5728.7390000000005
women feel that have that although I'd

5725.8 --> 5732.28
say that that women have largely thanks

5728.739 --> 5734.5599999999995
to feminism and sjw culture have kind of

5732.28 --> 5736.659
taken over that role it's like oh men

5734.56 --> 5739.96
are always so misogynistic yeah well now

5736.659 --> 5742.0599999999995
you have become that to men

5739.96 --> 5744.159
you're like oh I'm gonna have sex with

5742.06 --> 5746.9400000000005
them and then dump them before they can

5744.159 --> 5746.94
do it to me

5750.219 --> 5755.38
yeah well then men are gonna experience

5752.8 --> 5759.42
that same [ __ ] that you complain that

5755.38 --> 5759.42
men do to you or to other women

5767.199 --> 5773.759999999999
I'm looking for more women

5770.38 --> 5773.76
a good personality yeah

5785.52 --> 5791.1990000000005
I actually saw a woman in the

5788.739 --> 5795.04
supermarket like last week

5791.199 --> 5796.839999999999
that looks like astonishingly much like

5795.04 --> 5799.54
my ex

5796.84 --> 5803.5
my exact same build

5799.54 --> 5805.719
but my ex had their hair dyed black

5803.5 --> 5809.26
very Gothic because of it like she had

5805.719 --> 5812.38
exactly the same type of face

5809.26 --> 5813.88
it was like shocking like oh [ __ ]

5812.38 --> 5816.639
because

5813.88 --> 5819.400000000001
she was brilliant too but she also had

5816.639 --> 5820.900000000001
probably a grudge but I mean that's

5819.4 --> 5823.0599999999995
logical when you're intelligent you're

5820.9 --> 5825.04
gonna be like that but I mean I might

5823.06 --> 5827.02
meet somebody

5825.04 --> 5829.54
it's gonna be kind of like my ex I don't

5827.02 --> 5833.76
know there's a good chance that she does

5829.54 --> 5833.76
not like me she did not seem to have any

5833.8 --> 5839.38
unless I'm not gonna get into it I

5837.1 --> 5841.2390000000005
shouldn't look up some I shouldn't like

5839.38 --> 5842.86
get a relationship with somebody that

5841.239 --> 5844.54
looks just like my ex that would be

5842.86 --> 5847.199
unhealthy would probably lead to the

5844.54 --> 5847.199
same end result

5851.5 --> 5856.06
an interesting person to get to know my

5854.139 --> 5859.62
ex was a really interesting person to

5856.06 --> 5859.620000000001
get to know she was freaking brilliant

5860.02 --> 5862.8
dentist

5865.719 --> 5869.82
like yeah they are smart

5869.98 --> 5874.718999999999
and they're elaborate they're medical

5871.54 --> 5877.0
like they've learned so much

5874.719 --> 5879.219
and they usually like those types of

5877.0 --> 5882.1
people are just bored with life and so

5879.219 --> 5884.44
they just study things because otherwise

5882.1 --> 5887.620000000001
it's too boring

5884.44 --> 5890.82
amazing people like I really am into

5887.62 --> 5890.82
that kind of brilliance

5891.4 --> 5897.699
unfortunately I am usually kind of like

5894.219 --> 5900.3
a [ __ ] in the face of it

5897.699 --> 5900.299999999999
uh

5906.46 --> 5912.34
easy to date with dating apps

5910.239 --> 5914.5599999999995
it's a lot of bricks and scammers yeah

5912.34 --> 5917.56
no [ __ ]

5914.56 --> 5919.179
I'm gonna go dating apps I would have to

5917.56 --> 5922.7390000000005
have a freaking mobile now I'm not doing

5919.179 --> 5922.7390000000005
that at all no I'm gonna just

5923.92 --> 5929.58
just start talking to somebody

5926.56 --> 5929.580000000001
like hey

5931.179 --> 5936.3
about bs cheap as like hey I've seen you

5933.82 --> 5936.299999999999
here before

5936.639 --> 5943.02
I live near here like just

5940.179 --> 5943.02
basic

5943.48 --> 5948.0
and not some kind of weird pickup line

5945.52 --> 5948.0
or whatever

5949.54 --> 5954.34
or as soon as they give me that face

5951.94 --> 5956.5599999999995
where they're like no they actually like

5954.34 --> 5958.43
you then I can start to maybe act Goofy

5956.56 --> 5961.2390000000005
and see if they're into that or not

5958.43 --> 5964.06
[Music]

5961.239 --> 5966.12
I don't know I'm I'm fantasizing about

5964.06 --> 5970.320000000001
this way too much

5966.12 --> 5970.32
it makes me feel silly

5970.42 --> 5975.4890000000005
um

5972.29 --> 5975.489
[Music]

5995.08 --> 6001.219
did I attempt to talk to them no

5998.62 --> 6003.659
she looked like she was having a

6001.219 --> 6006.9
agitated day maybe on her period or

6003.659 --> 6006.9
something so

6007.32 --> 6011.299999999999
she had kind of a steel face

6012.42 --> 6017.78
I don't even know if she's really

6014.159 --> 6021.32
actually likable my ex had like likable

6017.78 --> 6021.32
components to herself

6022.32 --> 6027.5
I don't know if this one this could be

6024.239 --> 6027.5
like a really bitter woman

6028.5 --> 6035.159
but she was still young though

6031.44 --> 6036.96
so she could be like a raging feminist

6035.159 --> 6039.299999999999
for all I know

6036.96 --> 6041.58
that just like a smart one that just

6039.3 --> 6042.54
unfortunately slid down the slope of

6041.58 --> 6044.88
hell

6042.54 --> 6047.82
could be that could be like one of the

6044.88 --> 6050.78
most disgusting women I've ever seen

6047.82 --> 6050.78
you don't know

6063.0 --> 6068.06
but I

6065.28 --> 6068.0599999999995
I know

6071.159 --> 6077.759999999999
I yeah I do I I gotta have [ __ ] money

6074.88 --> 6079.86
like it's it's no point I'm not gonna

6077.76 --> 6082.139
step up to her and then eventually end

6079.86 --> 6084.239
up with like yeah it was nice talking

6082.139 --> 6085.56
with you I don't really have anything to

6084.239 --> 6086.78
invite you because I don't have any

6085.56 --> 6090.120000000001
money

6086.78 --> 6092.28
and my place really does look like a

6090.12 --> 6095.54
dump

6092.28 --> 6095.54
when you think about it

6097.5 --> 6103.199
I mean it could be worse

6099.719 --> 6105.78
but I mean it isn't presentable in my

6103.199 --> 6108.36
personal opinion when it comes to a lady

6105.78 --> 6111.719
that's actually worth something

6108.36 --> 6114.42
so yeah I don't like it's not here it's

6111.719 --> 6116.28
I yeah I could physically do it I could

6114.42 --> 6118.26
even charm and whatever but I don't want

6116.28 --> 6121.32
to present myself as poor and that's

6118.26 --> 6122.76
just a [ __ ] fact I hate it I don't

6121.32 --> 6126.119
have a proper

6122.76 --> 6128.639
playing board socially

6126.119 --> 6132.679
from that angle of approach and I don't

6128.639 --> 6132.679
want to have that

6133.32 --> 6136.099999999999
it's very simple

6141.06 --> 6148.280000000001
place is I likely identical or Worse

6143.58 --> 6148.28
statistically yeah I'm sure it is

6162.719 --> 6168.2390000000005
but I mean

6164.82 --> 6170.299999999999
yeah I gotta at least like

6168.239 --> 6173.879999999999
have enough

6170.3 --> 6177.659000000001
stashed to be able to like Enviro for

6173.88 --> 6181.139
dinner or something like make a steak

6177.659 --> 6184.259999999999
a real good organic steak dinner as I as

6181.139 --> 6186.5
I can make it right I mean at least do

6184.26 --> 6186.5
that

6188.28 --> 6191.96
but I probably could do that

6197.76 --> 6201.5
but yeah I don't know

6206.94 --> 6213.678999999999
if I ever visited Indonesia no

6210.48 --> 6213.678999999999
not yet anyway

6213.78 --> 6219.92
my dad did like in his 50s

6229.98 --> 6236.659
take them out on a date yes I know

6232.88 --> 6236.659000000001
that is very tough

6237.9 --> 6242.94
but I wouldn't like go out for dinner I

6241.86 --> 6244.38
don't do that

6242.94 --> 6247.919999999999
I cook

6244.38 --> 6251.04
because what I can cook is like at least

6247.92 --> 6253.08
twice as good as anything out there

6251.04 --> 6255.719
except when it comes to like these very

6253.08 --> 6257.82
specific type of vegan meals that I

6255.719 --> 6259.619
don't know how to make that and it it is

6257.82 --> 6261.119
kind of delicious

6259.619 --> 6263.699
but when it comes to like more

6261.119 --> 6267.259999999999
traditional cooking and all that I am

6263.699 --> 6267.259999999999
really good at that

6274.08 --> 6277.94
like my dad before me

6280.86 --> 6288.08

6324.119 --> 6328.88

6334.92 --> 6338.36
it's great as like lunch

it's like my eye muscles aren't as super

strong and lean as they were when I was

7462.38 --> 7467.900000000001

having a very specific tool

7955.94 --> 7960.638999999999
to read very very small letters

7960.739 --> 7965.0
so that's just common sense yeah it's

7963.199 --> 7968.239
called a little Loop

you can see like you can literally study

7968.239 --> 7972.739
the Contours of a of a grain of sand

7976.88 --> 7980.659000000001
want to read something

7978.44 --> 7982.94
you can literally just

7980.659 --> 7985.159
go look and look it like this look at

7982.94 --> 7987.98
that up close I can literally see the

7985.159 --> 7989.36
hairs sticking out of my skin

7987.98 --> 7991.4

yeah perfect

7991.4 --> 7995.32
I'm gonna wear glasses

7995.96 --> 8001.179

7998.179 --> 8001.179
everywhere

8001.659 --> 8005.739
it's one of those great tools like I got

8003.82 --> 8007.0599999999995
left over from being a Goldsmith and

8005.739 --> 8008.739
it's so small you could just take it

8007.06 --> 8011.4400000000005
with you everywhere

8008.739 --> 8013.48
and I can read anything

8011.44 --> 8017.32
no matter how small and inconvenient

8013.48 --> 8019.78
because I can literally spot the hairs

8017.32 --> 8021.94
on the flat side of my hand

8019.78 --> 8023.259999999999

on this

8023.26 --> 8027.280000000001
even though you can't see it but if you

8025.06 --> 8029.679
take a loop you can see it that's how

8027.28 --> 8032.159
well you can see with that thing

8029.679 --> 8032.159
okay

8032.44 --> 8036.299999999999
our prosthetic limbs gay too

8045.639 --> 8050.64
it depends

8047.43 --> 8050.64
[Music]

8052.119 --> 8058.96
I mean if it's like your right hand that

8056.38 --> 8060.88
you literally like

8058.96 --> 8064.2390000000005
all right

8060.88 --> 8068.219
like you lost your hand due to gangrene

8064.239 --> 8068.218999999999
from having an accident whacking off

8068.26 --> 8072.52
and then not treating it because you

8070.0 --> 8075.3
were ashamed yeah then a prosthetic is

8072.52 --> 8075.3
definitely gay

8099.84 --> 8105.099
to one eye to read a book yeah but if

8102.639 --> 8107.619
you have a book

8105.099 --> 8109.599
that that has a letter so small you

8107.619 --> 8112.839999999999
can't even properly read it you got the

8109.599 --> 8115.4800000000005
wrong book yeah that's like having a

8112.84 --> 8117.400000000001
Bible on on a piece like that that's so

8115.48 --> 8120.4
[ __ ] small you literally have to use

8117.4 --> 8125.199
a loop yeah it's cute to have that

8120.4 --> 8126.759999999999
but I mean if you want a book well maybe

8125.199 --> 8129.759999999999
you should read it

8126.76 --> 8131.8
at a scale that works

8129.76 --> 8135.76
right I mean on a computer it's very

8131.8 --> 8138.34
easy you can literally scroll to enlarge

8135.76 --> 8140.26
the font and to make it smaller well

8138.34 --> 8142.06
with the book you can't do that so when

8140.26 --> 8145.0
you buy a book you better damn well make

8142.06 --> 8146.92
sure that the print is of a doable size

8145.0 --> 8150.219
for you

8146.92 --> 8151.96
right now with labels on food items in

8150.219 --> 8154.06
the supermarket that's different you

8151.96 --> 8155.8
don't really get the choice well but you

8154.06 --> 8157.92
don't need to read it all the time you

8155.8 --> 8161.26
just need to read the label one time

8157.92 --> 8164.02
usually unless there's a product update

8161.26 --> 8166.26
and then a little Loop like that works

8164.02 --> 8166.26
perfect

8171.099 --> 8175.599
you can't read standard size books

8173.32 --> 8180.0599999999995
without glasses oh that's tough

8175.599 --> 8180.06
well I guess you're you're gay then MFL

8184.659 --> 8189.42
by my standards

8186.639 --> 8189.42
but it's okay

8198.399 --> 8203.219
how is it gay because I said it is

8209.679 --> 8213.88
it just is yeah even zept happy here

8212.139 --> 8215.82
gets it

8213.88 --> 8218.92
that he uses

8215.82 --> 8221.699999999999
nearsight it is

8218.92 --> 8221.7
as a cow

8228.519 --> 8233.800000000001
are you guys hey don't be so autistic

8231.399 --> 8236.46
about this Emma Peel

8233.8 --> 8236.46
come on

8241.3 --> 8245.438999999998
I mean yeah it's a bit of a stretch but

8243.58 --> 8247.66
I mean this should be logically

8245.439 --> 8250.300000000001
followable right so

8247.66 --> 8254.939
weakness is gay

8250.3 --> 8257.8
because well weakness is weak gay right

8254.939 --> 8261.76
homosexuality is weakness gay it's all

8257.8 --> 8264.16
weakness and gay and yeah if you need

8261.76 --> 8267.179
glasses to read something

8264.16 --> 8267.179
oh that's gay

8269.859 --> 8273.82
and it makes you dependent on those

8271.899 --> 8275.8
things and then you become even more gay

8273.82 --> 8279.16
that that's the gay thing about it right

8275.8 --> 8281.92
the gay thing about gay is that if you

8279.16 --> 8282.82
give in to it it'll always lead to more

8281.92 --> 8286.74
gay

8282.82 --> 8286.74
that's how you know it is gay

8286.899 --> 8289.84
right

8288.01 --> 8292.42
[Music]

8289.84 --> 8297.599
if your dependency on something leads to

8292.42 --> 8297.599
more dependency then that thing is gay

8299.45 --> 8302.679
[Music]

8303.88 --> 8310.119999999999
but the magnifying glass is not gay yes

8306.34 --> 8312.54
because I don't wear it on my head all

8310.12 --> 8312.54
day long

8318.58 --> 8323.859
too bad she's gay oh yeah it's still

8320.859 --> 8327.0
dater I mean half my ex-girlfriends were

8323.859 --> 8327.0
all were all

8327.939 --> 8331.42
into women as well

8329.859 --> 8334.359
so

8331.42 --> 8336.82
if you're a woman it's not bad as long

8334.359 --> 8338.679
as you want babies like you could be as

8336.82 --> 8341.32
gay as you want as a lady as long as you

8338.679 --> 8343.78
want babies and you're not gonna raise

8341.32 --> 8346.84
them liberal or pro-gay

8343.78 --> 8349.12
then it's all fine

8346.84 --> 8351.58
you like the ladies that's cool keep it

8349.12 --> 8353.62
a bit of a secret don't get public about

8351.58 --> 8358.2
it don't brag about how you're into

8353.62 --> 8358.2
women in public and I'm all good

8363.28 --> 8367.26
a band

8364.96 --> 8367.259999999998
yes

8373.019 --> 8378.359
Jose also wears glasses sometimes yeah I

8376.12 --> 8378.359
know

8380.26 --> 8385.800000000001
that's why he was projecting like he's

8382.78 --> 8389.26
saying are you gay is like yeah because

8385.8 --> 8390.22
he just realized he is gay so he had to

8389.26 --> 8392.800000000001
like

8390.22 --> 8395.32
say it to me first yeah because that's

8392.8 --> 8398.81
what a gay does they tell you a gay

8395.32 --> 8400.6
tells you you're the one that's gay

8398.81 --> 8404.039999999999
[Music]

8400.6 --> 8404.04
that's how you know they're gay

8410.14 --> 8415.66
yeah I know it's getting a little

8412.18 --> 8417.1
confusing at this point but I mean if

8415.66 --> 8418.119999999999
you don't get it at this point you're

8417.1 --> 8421.24
gay

8418.12 --> 8423.720000000001
if you don't get the joke about gay then

8421.24 --> 8423.72
you're gay

8429.16 --> 8435.66
and yes I know that circular reasoning

8432.64 --> 8435.66
it doesn't matter

8439.3 --> 8443.16
right fallacy is better than nothing

8451.21 --> 8456.399
[Music]

8454.18 --> 8458.26
in a meeting at work

8456.399 --> 8461.019999999999
yeah okay Emma but I mean you're already

8458.26 --> 8464.14
set you can't even read a normal font in

8461.02 --> 8466.66
a book without glasses so yeah I mean

8464.14 --> 8469.479
dude once you are gay

8466.66 --> 8471.76
that's just what it is right once you

8469.479 --> 8475.24
start wearing glasses

8471.76 --> 8477.7
then it's over and so then you end up in

8475.24 --> 8480.16
the like you started like ah am I having

8477.7 --> 8481.960000000001
a little trouble oh you wear glasses

8480.16 --> 8484.0
okay well guess what that um I'm having

8481.96 --> 8486.519999999999
a little trouble then leads to not

8484.0 --> 8487.66
training yourself to be able to still

8486.52 --> 8490.24
read

8487.66 --> 8491.619999999999
so then you completely lose the ability

8490.24 --> 8494.5
to do it

8491.62 --> 8498.1
you'll basically give up the the eye

8494.5 --> 8501.399
muscle exercise and then you become weak

8498.1 --> 8503.939
and gay with your eyes you have eye

8501.399 --> 8503.939
gayness

8515.26 --> 8517.92
see

8522.28 --> 8528.220000000001
weak eyes are gay yeah

8524.859 --> 8530.92
yes zap tappy

8528.22 --> 8533.019999999999
and it's okay you can say that because

8530.92 --> 8536.08
you've already admitted that you're you

8533.02 --> 8537.819000000001
got super weak eyes

8536.08 --> 8540.66
you can't even read something on the

8537.819 --> 8540.66
other side of the room

8543.25 --> 8548.79
[Music]

8552.65 --> 8555.9
[Music]

8558.58 --> 8564.7
by armin's Blood logic blind people must

8561.76 --> 8567.16
be super gay why are they wearing

8564.7 --> 8569.560000000001
glasses clammy

8567.16 --> 8570.88
that's really dumb you don't seem to get

8569.56 --> 8573.699999999999
it

8570.88 --> 8577.0
and that if you don't get the gay that

8573.7 --> 8580.240000000002
means you're gay clammy by what you just

8577.0 --> 8583.66
said you are gay not blind people yeah

8580.24 --> 8587.34
blind people don't wear glasses

8583.66 --> 8587.34
you don't seem to get it at all

8593.74 --> 8598.24
now if a blind person would be wearing

8596.08 --> 8601.359
glasses because they thought it would be

8598.24 --> 8604.96
fashionable now that's gay

8601.359 --> 8606.939
okay that is ultra gay but blind people

8604.96 --> 8610.0
usually don't wear glasses like that

8606.939 --> 8611.859
because they're not idiots and Vain and

8610.0 --> 8615.58
they don't even have like a sense of

8611.859 --> 8618.52
like Aesthetics like that visually so

8615.58 --> 8622.56
no blind people don't wear glasses

8618.52 --> 8622.560000000001
unless they are really really gay

8623.28 --> 8626.419
[Music]

8627.84 --> 8631.74
what about hearing aids

8631.78 --> 8635.009
[Music]

8637.18 --> 8646.6
well the it has the word AIDS in it

8642.58 --> 8646.6
should be kind of self-explanatory

8649.2 --> 8652.379
[Music]

8659.74 --> 8665.8
imagine a 43 year old man calling people

8663.22 --> 8668.5
where glasses are gay

8665.8 --> 8673.14
it's Priceless yeah but why would you

8668.5 --> 8673.14
imagine that I am doing it right now

8673.78 --> 8679.24
so if you think this is really Priceless

8676.06 --> 8681.84
well you can express that by sending me

8679.24 --> 8681.84
a PayPal

8683.14 --> 8688.119999999999
I know you wouldn't be able to donate

8685.06 --> 8691.859
enough to meet that Priceless nature of

8688.12 --> 8691.859
it but you can try

8696.76 --> 8701.76
hearing aids are in 99. what

8702.359 --> 8707.28
97.5 percent as gay as glasses

8707.74 --> 8711.88
well look the thing is with hearing aids

8710.859 --> 8715.0
is that

8711.88 --> 8717.46
you can't really like train your air

8715.0 --> 8718.96
muscles to hear better when you got

8717.46 --> 8720.039999999999
hearing damage

8718.96 --> 8722.199999999999
see

8720.04 --> 8725.979000000001
so it's different

8722.2 --> 8728.2
but if you have I if you have like a

8725.979 --> 8731.679999999998
trouble focusing with your eyes and then

8728.2 --> 8734.380000000001
you think oh it's getting hard I need

8731.68 --> 8737.859
glasses well that is that does make it

8734.38 --> 8740.619999999999
gay why because you could have actually

8737.859 --> 8743.859
taken the challenge and really taught

8740.62 --> 8746.380000000001
yourself to adapt to it becoming more

8743.859 --> 8748.720000000001
difficult instead of giving it up and

8746.38 --> 8751.92
getting glasses and then getting eye

8748.72 --> 8751.92
laziness because of it

8754.359 --> 8760.6
if you lose a leg in an accident

8757.66 --> 8762.939
do you turn gay

8760.6 --> 8765.04
well that depends on the nature of the

8762.939 --> 8767.439
accident

8765.04 --> 8769.240000000002
if you were crossing the road and you

8767.439 --> 8771.76
didn't notice that car coming because

8769.24 --> 8774.76
you were staring in your mobile

8771.76 --> 8778.68
checking your Facebook page then yes

8774.76 --> 8778.68
losing your leg is very gay

8794.68 --> 8799.02
do you understand what I'm talking about

8796.6 --> 8799.02
here

8799.18 --> 8803.92
I know it sounds kind of funny and such

8801.22 --> 8807.479
but there is actually a logical system

8803.92 --> 8810.460000000001
behind this reasoning

8807.479 --> 8815.279999999999
yeah it doesn't matter like what it is

8810.46 --> 8815.279999999999
it depends on how you got it you see

8825.28 --> 8828.34
this is comedy goes should have millions

8827.26 --> 8830.979
of Subs

8828.34 --> 8833.380000000001
well to be fair I'm basically stealing

8830.979 --> 8835.539999999999
this routine from Owen Benjamin because

8833.38 --> 8838.779999999999
he's the one that's kind of

8835.54 --> 8841.78
I he does this all the time on the show

8838.78 --> 8844.0
and I thought I tried today why not he's

8841.78 --> 8845.859
kind of ruin it by the way which is kind

8844.0 --> 8847.78
of gay because he took it too far saying

8845.859 --> 8849.1
that oh you're gay if you walk into a

8847.78 --> 8852.04
building

8849.1 --> 8856.42
like yeah that's just pandering to

8852.04 --> 8859.0
retards I don't appreciate that

8856.42 --> 8862.14
but I mean this is just it's a formula

8859.0 --> 8862.14
like yeah

8865.42 --> 8872.26
right

8867.1 --> 8875.380000000001
it's just anything you do that you do

8872.26 --> 8877.18
because of convenience

8875.38 --> 8879.099999999999
and because you were a little too lazy

8877.18 --> 8882.16
to take the challenge

8879.1 --> 8884.2
that is gay

8882.16 --> 8888.0
anything

8884.2 --> 8888.0
I love Owen don't I yeah

8888.22 --> 8893.319
I I really look up to him in that sense

8891.28 --> 8895.899000000001
even though I'm actually older than him

8893.319 --> 8898.119999999999
with by a few months

8895.899 --> 8902.46
I'm kind of funny like that

8898.12 --> 8902.460000000001
and I'm quite jealous of certain things

8910.54 --> 8914.460000000001
and not jealous of all the things

8919.72 --> 8924.938999999998
I mean he talks about sexual things way

8923.319 --> 8926.979
too much for me

8924.939 --> 8929.08
like it it repulses me a little

8926.979 --> 8931.619999999999
sometimes it really does make me think

8929.08 --> 8935.08
that he might secretly be gay

8931.62 --> 8937.899000000001
like talking about it that much in that

8935.08 --> 8941.58
much detail the gross things about yeah

8937.899 --> 8941.58
it's it's like too far

8943.72 --> 8950.979
jealous why

8945.939 --> 8955.06
because he has an amazing life am appeal

8950.979 --> 8958.119999999999
he really has an amazing life

8955.06 --> 8959.199999999999
and amazing talents and energy just this

8958.12 --> 8961.18
energy

8959.2 --> 8963.819000000001
I feel like I can do it spirit with him

8961.18 --> 8967.18
but he has just much better he's

8963.819 --> 8969.88
maintained his sources better

8967.18 --> 8972.64
between the two of us I am definitely

8969.88 --> 8974.979
the gay one

8972.64 --> 8977.319
compared to him

8974.979 --> 8980.26
like he took on the beatings and

8977.319 --> 8982.779999999999
everything I shied away from that I got

8980.26 --> 8985.359
intimidated when I was younger I was

8982.78 --> 8989.08
more cowardly

8985.359 --> 8991.84
I was more easily convinced

8989.08 --> 8995.08
by others that were kind of jealous or

8991.84 --> 8998.380000000001
hated me that I was worthless it's very

8995.08 --> 9001.319
easy to manipulate that's all those are

8998.38 --> 9003.899
gay weak traits

9001.319 --> 9007.14
and people literally told me I was gay

9003.899 --> 9010.68
and eventually I started believing it

9007.14 --> 9013.699999999999
okay that is gay

9010.68 --> 9015.979000000001
but I'm not homosexual though I have

9013.7 --> 9018.78
absolute physical

9015.979 --> 9022.38
physiological evidence for that

9018.78 --> 9024.359
was it gay man doesn't like give up like

9022.38 --> 9028.16
throw up I mean

9024.359 --> 9028.16
like the second they do anything

9028.439 --> 9031.58
definitely not

9035.7 --> 9040.460000000001
or they're just like super self sadistic

9041.399 --> 9045.539999999999
like Massachusetts

9043.2 --> 9047.640000000001
then maybe but no

9045.54 --> 9050.1
so yeah

9047.64 --> 9053.24
I am kind of jealous of of our Benjamin

9050.1 --> 9053.24
in many ways like that

9056.16 --> 9061.319
but I mean I don't like I'm not envious

9059.1 --> 9064.800000000001
in that sense if that's a proper word

9061.319 --> 9066.479
for it like I don't like I don't want to

9064.8 --> 9069.74
take him a notch down

9066.479 --> 9069.74
I think he's great

9069.78 --> 9074.58
he's a he is in ways a big enough

9072.12 --> 9078.42
inspiration

9074.58 --> 9082.14
but he does have things that I don't and

9078.42 --> 9085.8
that makes me a little sad sometimes

9082.14 --> 9089.039999999999
also because it's like yeah I

9085.8 --> 9091.319
I wouldn't be able like my life just

9089.04 --> 9094.380000000001
didn't go like that I didn't have it in

9091.319 --> 9097.68
me back then I had too many weakness

9094.38 --> 9099.539999999999
cowardice issues about myself when I was

9097.68 --> 9103.62
younger

9099.54 --> 9107.34
like I was really just like I felt so

9103.62 --> 9108.54
broken all the time so incapable of

9107.34 --> 9110.76
actually

9108.54 --> 9113.160000000002
doing something and growing within

9110.76 --> 9116.18
Society I was so disconnected from

9113.16 --> 9119.6
society in ways emotional ways

9116.18 --> 9119.6
intellectual ways

9119.939 --> 9124.74
I was always operating on completely

9122.52 --> 9126.300000000001
different levels that people didn't even

9124.74 --> 9129.76
know

9126.3 --> 9131.099999999999
they forgot about that [ __ ]

9129.76 --> 9132.91
[Music]

9131.1 --> 9136.129
and it just didn't work

9132.91 --> 9136.128999999999
[Music]

9143.1 --> 9147.68
are you gonna use your phone when you

9145.02 --> 9147.68
can't read it

9149.88 --> 9152.72
in your eyes

9156.66 --> 9158.899
what

9166.56 --> 9171.359
you can't use less yeah that doesn't

9168.6 --> 9174.02
work Elko that that look if you're

9171.359 --> 9178.02
already wearing glasses it's too late

9174.02 --> 9180.6
that's my point yeah

9178.02 --> 9184.92
just like oh you're getting into sodomy

9180.6 --> 9188.78
well that's too bad it's too late then

9184.92 --> 9188.78
yeah you don't get it back

9192.54 --> 9196.92
yeah

9194.7 --> 9198.899000000001
you can't like oh wow I've been wearing

9196.92 --> 9201.479
glasses for 10 years but I just learned

9198.899 --> 9203.279999999999
that it's actually really not it's kind

9201.479 --> 9205.14
of gay you shouldn't do that you should

9203.28 --> 9207.6
train your yeah that's too bad you've

9205.14 --> 9210.42
been wearing them for 10 years too late

9207.6 --> 9212.04
yeah you should have done that the

9210.42 --> 9214.08
moment you started to get like oh I'm

9212.04 --> 9216.0
having a little trouble reading yeah

9214.08 --> 9218.88
that's the moment when you should

9216.0 --> 9220.38
realize hey I should do some training

9218.88 --> 9222.899
yeah

9220.38 --> 9225.679999999998
if you do it 10 years after you've been

9222.899 --> 9230.18
wearing glasses every day it's too late

9225.68 --> 9230.18
yeah you don't get it back

9244.26 --> 9250.800000000001
you can get laser eye surgery oh sure

9247.74 --> 9252.539999999999
sure you could M stem

9250.8 --> 9255.84
I mean you can

9252.54 --> 9260.28
but it could also blind you

9255.84 --> 9262.56
yeah there's a an actual percentage that

9260.28 --> 9265.560000000001
it can go wrong and then you'll

9262.56 --> 9268.26
literally be blind

9265.56 --> 9271.64
and if you get blinded

9268.26 --> 9271.64
because of eye surgery

9271.979 --> 9275.039999999999
that's like one of the gayest things

9273.899 --> 9277.74
ever

9275.04 --> 9279.6
right because think of all the steps

9277.74 --> 9282.06
for you to get to that point of getting

9279.6 --> 9285.18
blinded yeah you had a little trouble

9282.06 --> 9286.979
with focusing reading something so you

9285.18 --> 9290.220000000001
thought oh I'm gonna take glasses that's

9286.979 --> 9292.56
gay step number one then you're like I

9290.22 --> 9295.14
don't want to wear the glasses I'm gonna

9292.56 --> 9297.979
get eye surgery so I can look like I

9295.14 --> 9301.979
have no eye issues yeah

9297.979 --> 9304.019999999999
that's double gay and then you literally

9301.979 --> 9306.72
get blinded because the surgery goes

9304.02 --> 9309.720000000001
wrong now you're blind that's triple gay

9306.72 --> 9312.06
yeah all you needed to do is just do

9309.72 --> 9314.46
some more effort in actually eye

9312.06 --> 9316.8
training yourself when I just first

9314.46 --> 9319.019999999999
started getting issues and then you

9316.8 --> 9321.24
would not have ended up blind

9319.02 --> 9324.68
yeah there's nothing more gay than

9321.24 --> 9324.68
getting blighted from eye surgery

9325.02 --> 9328.02
foreign

9328.07 --> 9331.27
[Music]

9335.399 --> 9340.56
but to be fair I mean if you have like

9338.16 --> 9343.92
intangible eyes

9340.56 --> 9346.08
like certain people sometimes have right

9343.92 --> 9349.16
if you have like the eye type where you

9346.08 --> 9352.68
need to wear like those

9349.16 --> 9355.14
jars like the big chunks of glasses

9352.68 --> 9357.359
because you're like really [ __ ] gay

9355.14 --> 9359.46
you could say but then you're born that

9357.359 --> 9360.78
way because if you have those kind of

9359.46 --> 9362.938999999998
glasses like

9360.78 --> 9364.5
there's no eye training you can do to

9362.939 --> 9367.14
prevent yourself from becoming

9364.5 --> 9369.359
completely incapable of seeing things

9367.14 --> 9370.858999999999
it's basically a mutation it's a

9369.359 --> 9372.66
malformed eye

9370.859 --> 9374.939
and this you could argue that that's

9372.66 --> 9377.76
inherited gay from your from your

9374.939 --> 9379.380000000001
ancestors or something they [ __ ] their

9377.76 --> 9380.7
eyes up somehow

9379.38 --> 9383.16
right

9380.7 --> 9385.62
but I mean if you have that kind of eyes

9383.16 --> 9389.28
that you have to wear Jr glasses and you

9385.62 --> 9391.439
got laser surgery well then I think that

9389.28 --> 9394.859
that's one of the few ways

9391.439 --> 9396.54
you could do that and not be gay unless

9394.859 --> 9399.54
it went wrong and you lost your sight

9396.54 --> 9403.380000000001
then yeah then it is gay

9399.54 --> 9405.660000000002
but I mean if you just

9403.38 --> 9407.519999999999
have been wearing glasses for a long

9405.66 --> 9410.64
time and you don't want to wear them

9407.52 --> 9413.28
anymore because of vanity

9410.64 --> 9415.56
and you get eye surgery and then it goes

9413.28 --> 9417.84
wrong and you lose your eyes that is

9415.56 --> 9421.22
like the ultimate gay

9417.84 --> 9421.22
multiple step gay

9426.72 --> 9430.24
[Music]

9433.04 --> 9438.92
we're just having fun here

9435.66 --> 9438.92
pink glasses yeah

9440.22 --> 9442.699999999999
it's

9446.58 --> 9450.24
it's is this conversation really

9448.14 --> 9451.979
happening yes it is Emma Peel it is

9450.24 --> 9454.819
really happening and the storm is about

9451.979 --> 9454.819
to break loose

9468.62 --> 9472.02
there you go

9470.03 --> 9476.66
[Music]

9472.02 --> 9476.66
it's about to break loose baby

9479.34 --> 9484.62
it's already raining

9482.34 --> 9487.2
wonder how hard it'll go I have to set

9484.62 --> 9489.0
the plants so that they don't blow away

9487.2 --> 9492.439
hold on

9489.0 --> 9492.439
man got dark in here

9520.26 --> 9524.0
whoa now

9527.819 --> 9533.479
oh [ __ ]

9529.7 --> 9533.479000000001
it's getting heavy

9534.84 --> 9539.7
oh the nice fresh wind is great though

9537.3 --> 9542.519999999999
it's really nice and refreshing but man

9539.7 --> 9544.76
did it just get dark in here

9542.52 --> 9544.76
foreign

9545.78 --> 9551.479000000001
doesn't really seem to

9548.88 --> 9551.479
any difference

9555.96 --> 9560.06
it was quick it just stopped here oh

9557.819 --> 9560.06
okay

9560.16 --> 9563.3
wow okay

9567.02 --> 9572.12
inside I'll just keep it open like that

9573.42 --> 9576.74
that's a proper storm

9577.14 --> 9579.8
noise

9584.72 --> 9588.619999999999
150 kilometers away okay

9594.359 --> 9596.42
oh

9596.64 --> 9605.3
real men can wear pink

9599.7 --> 9605.300000000001
it only looks gay if you're gay

9607.14 --> 9612.56
yeah sorry I could have done it wearing

9609.66 --> 9612.56
pink is just gay

9617.939 --> 9624.899
I mean the only time I could remember

9622.2 --> 9628.800000000001
seeing a man wearing pink and not

9624.899 --> 9633.24
thinking directly is gay was like

9628.8 --> 9635.099999999999
do what yeah playing tennis

9633.24 --> 9638.58
see like people

9635.1 --> 9640.380000000001
pretty buff guys pretty handsome wearing

9638.58 --> 9643.5
pink and they didn't look gay but they

9640.38 --> 9646.619999999999
could actually have been gay

9643.5 --> 9649.2
I don't know I'm not sure

9646.62 --> 9651.6
I think that if a man actually gets to

9649.2 --> 9653.76
the point where they wear gay they could

9651.6 --> 9656.479000000001
say no it's not gay but it actually

9653.76 --> 9656.479
still is

9661.68 --> 9665.18
our wheelchair is gay

9665.58 --> 9671.58
yeah kind of

9668.52 --> 9674.359
should they be trying harder to walk

9671.58 --> 9674.359
no

9678.359 --> 9683.880000000001
but I mean it could be

9681.18 --> 9686.04
it all depends right I mean if you're

9683.88 --> 9688.019999999999
not willing to go through which is

9686.04 --> 9692.28
usually kind of brutal

9688.02 --> 9694.319000000001
revalid revalidation revalidation

9692.28 --> 9696.66
you got into an accident or something it

9694.319 --> 9698.88
can be really hard to learn how to walk

9696.66 --> 9701.58
in that yeah

9698.88 --> 9703.92
it's very brutal but if you give that up

9701.58 --> 9707.479
and then just settle for a wheelchair

9703.92 --> 9707.479
yeah that's gay

9721.14 --> 9728.039999999999
so again it's not about if you're in a

9724.74 --> 9730.08
wheelchair does that make you gay no it

9728.04 --> 9732.560000000001
depends on how you got in that

9730.08 --> 9732.56
wheelchair

9741.18 --> 9746.76
right like paraplegic bear who

9743.46 --> 9749.339999999998
apparently got like shot while dealing

9746.76 --> 9751.439
drugs or something in Baltimore if I

9749.34 --> 9754.859
have if I believe own Benjamin story

9751.439 --> 9758.359
about that yeah that's gay that's a gay

9754.859 --> 9758.359
reason to get in a wheelchair

9762.84 --> 9769.68
now if you're a firefighter

9766.5 --> 9772.02
and you're crushing it and then as

9769.68 --> 9773.28
you're rescuing a baby out of a burning

9772.02 --> 9776.460000000001
building

9773.28 --> 9778.68
like unfortunately like this beam comes

9776.46 --> 9781.56
crashing down and and breaks your legs

9778.68 --> 9784.859
really bad but you managed to save the

9781.56 --> 9788.46
child by throwing it outside something

9784.859 --> 9790.140000000001
and you lose like the ability for you to

9788.46 --> 9792.479
use the your leg and you end up in a

9790.14 --> 9795.5
wheelchair now that's not gay because of

9792.479 --> 9795.5
how you got there

9799.74 --> 9804.539999999999
and that guy is in the wheelchair will

9802.14 --> 9807.24
never feel gay

9804.54 --> 9808.560000000001
because of how he lost his ability to

9807.24 --> 9811.439
walk

9808.56 --> 9813.539999999999
see it's not that you don't have it it's

9811.439 --> 9817.14
how you lost it

9813.54 --> 9818.7
did you lose it because of weakness

9817.14 --> 9821.76
or by

9818.7 --> 9825.240000000002
share faith

9821.76 --> 9828.6
by being unlucky being designated by God

9825.24 --> 9831.56
and then how did you deal with it right

9828.6 --> 9831.56
that's what matters

9835.14 --> 9840.06
do the Scottish look gay when they're

9837.6 --> 9842.66
wearing skirts

9840.06 --> 9842.66
no

9846.24 --> 9852.08
unless they're like really pudgy

9848.939 --> 9852.08
then it does look gay

9858.38 --> 9862.319
[Music]

9861.359 --> 9865.380000000001
okay

9862.319 --> 9868.019999999999
have you seen trans able that's yeah but

9865.38 --> 9871.08
I mean do do I need to say anything

9868.02 --> 9873.66
about that M appeal I mean that's like

9871.08 --> 9876.979
the Pinnacle of gay

9873.66 --> 9879.84
the Pinnacle of weak is self-created

9876.979 --> 9883.46
sought out

9879.84 --> 9883.460000000001
wanted weakness

9884.34 --> 9889.62
yeah there's nothing more gay than that

9886.74 --> 9893.76
nothing

9889.62 --> 9895.800000000001
it is brutally pathetic

9893.76 --> 9899.34
and it should be illegal

9895.8 --> 9904.22
people like that should not be indulged

9899.34 --> 9904.22
they should be put into a mental Asylum

9919.859 --> 9923.24
talking about Elko

9923.34 --> 9928.74
okay baby Jesus

9926.52 --> 9932.960000000001
whoa

9928.74 --> 9932.96
oh my God that's rain

9933.06 --> 9938.34
look at this

9935.7 --> 9942.42
Bang

9938.34 --> 9946.64
there is gushing this is like

9942.42 --> 9946.64
flooding level rain right now

9953.399 --> 9957.479
great

9955.979 --> 9961.92
means we're gonna have some really

9957.479 --> 9961.92
really green grass awesome

9966.6 --> 9970.939
what's the gayest elevation angle

9973.38 --> 9978.179999999998
well

9975.06 --> 9980.819
gayest elevation angle would be

9978.18 --> 9983.359
the elevation angle taken from a curved

9980.819 --> 9983.359
Baseline

9983.88 --> 9988.339999999998
that would be the gayest elevation angle

9993.72 --> 9997.039999999999
yeah I know moxie

10001.22 --> 10005.3
I also like the big trees we'll be very

10003.56 --> 10007.76
thankful because

10005.3 --> 10009.56
Big Trees don't really get anything from

10007.76 --> 10012.859
just a little bit of rain it has like a

10009.56 --> 10015.199999999999
rain hard before it gets to

10012.859 --> 10017.78
it gets deeper into the ground to the to

10015.2 --> 10019.819000000001
their Roots so this is like great for

10017.78 --> 10020.87
Big Trees Too

10019.819 --> 10028.1
it's buckets

10020.87 --> 10028.1
[Music]

10038.18 --> 10044.54

10044.54 --> 10048.399000000001
what

10046.34 --> 10048.399
oh

10053.439 --> 10060.319
I don't see why unless you have a very

10057.56 --> 10062.5
specific reason why you think Welsh are

10060.319 --> 10062.5
gay

10073.16 --> 10078.68
oh I don't go I didn't know you were

10075.38 --> 10081.339999999998
Dutch or in the Netherlands

10078.68 --> 10081.34
huh

10084.859 --> 10094.479000000001
yeah yeah that's that's ex gamma gets it

10089.899 --> 10094.479
Emma with her glasses is my kind of gay

10104.0 --> 10109.42
I'm just messing with you I think you're

10106.58 --> 10109.42
probably pretty cute

10110.899 --> 10117.319
and yeah I mean

10114.8 --> 10120.259999999998
I'm not gonna get deeper into it let's

10117.319 --> 10122.539999999999
just say I don't mind women wearing

10120.26 --> 10124.28
glasses if they got the right type of

10122.54 --> 10126.880000000001
glasses and they're not hysterical

10124.28 --> 10126.880000000001
[ __ ]

10127.04 --> 10133.28
because that is a terrible combination

10131.12 --> 10136.42
if you're gonna be hysterical then don't

10133.28 --> 10136.42
be wearing glasses

10142.04 --> 10147.5
oh okay you've been open Netherlands

10144.38 --> 10149.66
okay I didn't realize that but you do

10147.5 --> 10151.16
have a Dutch name though ilko is a very

10149.66 --> 10154.359
Dutch name

10151.16 --> 10158.319
so I was like not sure okay good to know

10154.359 --> 10158.319
but a few Dutch guys

10160.22 --> 10164.74
probably killed

10162.2 --> 10164.740000000002
probably

10164.899 --> 10168.34
what will you want to try it out

10171.14 --> 10176.72
I mean if I to believe the picture

10174.14 --> 10178.46
on your profile yeah

10176.72 --> 10182.14
but you're kind of cheating there aren't

10178.46 --> 10182.14
you because you're not wearing glasses

10194.84 --> 10197.84
huh

10199.52 --> 10206.560000000001
okay that's an interesting combination

10202.84 --> 10206.56
Indonesian Friesian

10206.68 --> 10209.739
[Music]

10220.28 --> 10226.720000000001
okay what am appeal at least is very

10223.7 --> 10226.720000000001
confident of herself

10227.899 --> 10233.14
you put a pick with glasses tomorrow

10230.06 --> 10233.14
that's hilarious

10239.42 --> 10243.04

[Music]

10258.09 --> 10261.479

10263.3 --> 10267.64
oh okay that was over quick

10268.16 --> 10271.3
it's only dripping now

10275.06 --> 10281.3
yeah makeup the makeup can make a woman

10278.3 --> 10283.938999999998
look completely different

10281.3 --> 10287.539999999999
a certain type of women and that like

10283.939 --> 10290.18
without and with makeup like I literally

10287.54 --> 10291.859
would think consistently that they were

10290.18 --> 10294.1
two different women

10291.859 --> 10297.819
makeup can make you look so different

10294.1 --> 10297.819
it's pretty surreal

10301.939 --> 10306.14
leave some women for the rest of us what

10304.46 --> 10310.419999999998
what

10306.14 --> 10310.42
no get your own women's Aunt Debbie

10328.76 --> 10333.04
I don't know yes I agree

10350.24 --> 10355.939
I'm not a super big fan of makeup but

10353.06 --> 10358.119999999999
some women can really do magic with it

10355.939 --> 10358.12
though

10365.02 --> 10371.24
if I ever did pee no what the hell would

10368.96 --> 10375.679999999998
I do that I think I went on the show

10371.24 --> 10378.08
like in 2016 one time but I mean

10375.68 --> 10380.479000000001
the guy is just an anti-flat earth or

10378.08 --> 10382.52
he's not really gonna seriously inquire

10380.479 --> 10385.88
and all that I'm just gonna try to

10382.52 --> 10388.939
create wedges between flat earthers he's

10385.88 --> 10390.74
just very typical anti-flat earther I

10388.939 --> 10392.720000000001
never really felt like wasting my time

10390.74 --> 10394.64
with that guy

10392.72 --> 10396.979
but back in the day yeah I did try to

10394.64 --> 10398.778999999999
get me in the Google Hangouts days I did

10396.979 --> 10402.14
actually think I think that I didn't go

10398.779 --> 10404.060000000001
on the show one time

10402.14 --> 10406.58
but I didn't really have a lot of

10404.06 --> 10410.38
argumentation readily available back

10406.58 --> 10410.38
then it's all pretty Black Swan days

10412.819 --> 10418.519999999999
but no I don't I'm not looking for Red's

10416.12 --> 10420.380000000001
rhetoric to be part of his show or any

10418.52 --> 10422.359
other anti-flat earther I'm not doing

10420.38 --> 10425.06
that sort of [ __ ]

10422.359 --> 10428.66
I'm not really that good at it anyway I

10425.06 --> 10430.58
mean I am good at figuring out positions

10428.66 --> 10434.3
and arguments

10430.58 --> 10436.819
I just don't like this hostile attitude

10434.3 --> 10438.199999999999
I don't like like hostile debating I

10436.819 --> 10440.778999999999
like debating

10438.2 --> 10443.42
among friends

10440.779 --> 10446.359
that will give you the room to

10443.42 --> 10448.88
potentially dug up new things that are

10446.359 --> 10451.399000000001
interesting for all that's the type of

10448.88 --> 10453.92
conversation I like to have you can't

10451.399 --> 10455.96
have that with anti-flatterers because

10453.92 --> 10458.960000000001
they're always obsessed with somehow

10455.96 --> 10460.938999999998
maneuvering you to position where you

10458.96 --> 10462.38
make flat earth look stupid and they

10460.939 --> 10465.02
can't help it

10462.38 --> 10467.72
I don't want to deal with those people

10465.02 --> 10471.1
they're obsessed you can't have a

10467.72 --> 10471.099999999999
natural conversation with him

10472.34 --> 10478.08
he is one of the nicest Glovers

10476.24 --> 10481.289999999999
okay

10478.08 --> 10481.289999999999
[Music]

10484.22 --> 10487.42
I don't know about that

10496.52 --> 10500.92
yeah turret they are ready

10508.7 --> 10512.18
you can't speak for his friends Oh you

10510.5 --> 10513.74
mean those friends that he always does

10512.18 --> 10516.439
have on

10513.74 --> 10519.8
yeah

10516.439 --> 10523.819
I mean that's like saying oh Jose JG

10519.8 --> 10526.819
Gonzalez isn't all that bad towards flat

10523.819 --> 10530.42
earthers yeah he's always very nice and

10526.819 --> 10534.08
polite but he literally lets Sean

10530.42 --> 10537.08
Hawkins and some other really nasty Folk

10534.08 --> 10540.2
spam the [ __ ] out of the place and say

10537.08 --> 10542.72
the most vile [ __ ] ever

10540.2 --> 10546.319000000001
and like maybe say hey don't do that and

10542.72 --> 10548.72
you just let them do it so yeah I mean

10546.319 --> 10550.88
oh he's not personally nasty yeah but he

10548.72 --> 10552.679999999998
hangs around with nasty people that

10550.88 --> 10557.179999999998
you're gonna have to deal with if you

10552.68 --> 10560.5
deal with him so it is nasty

10557.18 --> 10560.5
because of Association

10563.54 --> 10568.580000000002
right that that just seems as a setup

10566.54 --> 10570.92
much more like a good cop bad cop

10568.58 --> 10573.5
scenario that he's maneuvering himself

10570.92 --> 10577.279
in and that is actually genuinely

10573.5 --> 10579.14
wanting to be nice to a flat earther

10577.279 --> 10581.380000000001
Just Gonna Keep The Nasty around every

10579.14 --> 10581.38

10591.08 --> 10594.58

10606.8 --> 10611.479
but

10607.88 --> 10614.599999999999
I mean being actually completely going

10611.479 --> 10617.42
like not going balding yeah you could

10614.6 --> 10619.34
say that that might be gay Owen Benjamin

10617.42 --> 10622.34
certainly argues it he says that you

10619.34 --> 10626.8
only get bald because you

10622.34 --> 10626.8
back off it's hilarious by the way

10627.56 --> 10630.399
but uh

10630.8 --> 10635.84
if you're just like oh I'm just gonna

10632.54 --> 10638.12

10663.62 --> 10669.58
Mercury and level gay and I'll never do

10667.04 --> 10669.580000000002

10673.899 --> 10679.46
pluck of hair

10676.34 --> 10681.439

been slightly receding since I was 20.

10721.1 --> 10728.779
yeah

10722.66 --> 10730.399
I'm 43 now it hasn't really changed all

10728.779 --> 10734.26
that much

10730.399 --> 10734.26
okay [ __ ] with

10735.14 --> 10739.819
so you could keep yelling to me like oh

10737.779 --> 10741.560000000001
like I'm some 20 year old who's suddenly

10739.819 --> 10744.619999999999
losing all their hair that happens to

10741.56 --> 10748.46
some yeah yeah it's not gonna happen you

10744.62 --> 10752.779
[ __ ] little [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah it's

10748.46 --> 10756.679999999998
been like this for 23 years

10752.779 --> 10760.640000000001
yeah I didn't suddenly lose all my hair

10756.68 --> 10763.779
like some baldy people like you Theo low

10760.64 --> 10763.778999999999
diet probably

10764.18 --> 10768.74
some frustrated little gamma [ __ ] who

10766.88 --> 10770.96
suddenly lost all their hair in their

10768.74 --> 10773.479
20s because they whacked off too much

10770.96 --> 10776.72
because they got obsessed with sex

10773.479 --> 10779.84
yeah I'm not that guy I'm 483 I still

10776.72 --> 10782.3
have all my natural hair it's slightly

10779.84 --> 10785.42
receding yeah

10782.3 --> 10788.74
yeah I have better hair than my dad did

10785.42 --> 10788.74
at this age

10790.399 --> 10793.0
okay

10793.16 --> 10798.56
but that's also because well I've been

10796.58 --> 10802.0
eating very healthy

10798.56 --> 10802.0
for a very long time

10804.74 --> 10807.88
and that does help

10809.359 --> 10815.779
so fat hair good

10811.16 --> 10818.96
yeah five roads and I mean I am not like

10815.779 --> 10822.62
completely without any kind of thing

10818.96 --> 10825.438999999998
that I do I do sometimes yeah I mean I'm

10822.62 --> 10827.720000000001
Still A Guy I think about sex still it's

10825.439 --> 10828.859
just that I'm not like squirting every

10827.72 --> 10832.899
day

10828.859 --> 10832.899000000001
like it's coffee or something

10835.939 --> 10840.62
because if you do that all the time yeah

10838.399 --> 10842.858999999999
I bet you do go bald if you do that all

10840.62 --> 10842.859
the time

10845.96 --> 10852.46
it's very [ __ ] funny the other light

10849.2 --> 10852.460000000001
very [ __ ] funny

10852.979 --> 10858.08
but it's too small to see so what the

10856.279 --> 10860.439
[ __ ] is the point of that you call that

10858.08 --> 10860.439
a joke

10862.7 --> 10867.939
projecting balding [ __ ] wit [ __ ]

10868.04 --> 10873.76
got any more smart ass remarks you

10870.68 --> 10873.76
[ __ ] little [ __ ]

10874.16 --> 10876.7
huh

10889.76 --> 10895.64
yeah I know he speaks from experience

10891.68 --> 10897.979000000001
he's just an envious little [ __ ] wit

10895.64 --> 10900.8
squirt boy lost everything at a young

10897.979 --> 10904.64
age never got to that golden age of

10900.8 --> 10908.06
being like actually desired after by

10904.64 --> 10911.24
women so he's jealous at this guy with

10908.06 --> 10913.64
43 is still handsome enough to be at

10911.24 --> 10915.859
that level when he feels good and he

10913.64 --> 10920.08
knows that he never had that so he's an

10915.859 --> 10920.08
envious little [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]

10920.54 --> 10926.359
it has to backstab all the time and try

10922.76 --> 10927.439
to impose the same nightmares that he

10926.359 --> 10929.84

10935.72 --> 10939.858999999999
thought that somebody might see it

10937.939 --> 10942.939
yeah

10939.859 --> 10942.939

yeah no I'm not calling you gay

11070.26 --> 11075.1
you seemed pretty cool although I mean

11073.6 --> 11077.319
just because you have four children

11075.1 --> 11079.359
doesn't mean that you're gay it just

11077.319 --> 11081.64
usually means that your children will be

11079.359 --> 11084.399000000001
gay too

11081.64 --> 11086.019999999999
that's the issue just because you're gay

11084.399 --> 11088.599999999999
doesn't mean that you can't procreate

11086.02 --> 11091.800000000001
it's just that it'll just make your

11088.6 --> 11091.800000000001
children gay too

11092.2 --> 11097.240000000002
right once you to tolerate gay

11094.6 --> 11100.24
that means that

11097.24 --> 11102.699999999999
people around you will become gay yeah

11100.24 --> 11105.06
if you tolerate gay people will become

I'm proud of you man

11115.6 --> 11120.359
the younger you are the more it it makes

11117.939 --> 11120.359
a difference

11122.8 --> 11127.72
yeah the visceral descriptions might be

11125.92 --> 11130.54
a little excessive there

11127.72 --> 11131.8
but uh yeah I know you're very serious

11130.54 --> 11134.5
with it and

11131.8 --> 11136.0
it's a very wise thing to do at a young

11134.5 --> 11139.6
age

11136.0 --> 11143.26
I wish I was that wise at that age

11139.6 --> 11145.5
I would have been wise at that age I was

11143.26 --> 11145.5
not

11155.2 --> 11159.460000000001
how old is Terry he's in his 20s

11157.72 --> 11160.42
I think

11159.46 --> 11164.039999999999
right

11160.42 --> 11164.04
how old are you again turret

11172.56 --> 11176.92
were you still a teenager I don't

11174.819 --> 11180.84
remember

11176.92 --> 11180.84
I think turrets in his early 20s

11183.34 --> 11188.52
half a

11185.2 --> 11188.52
I don't know how much that is

11205.3 --> 11210.3
20 what

11207.939 --> 11210.300000000001
right

11211.06 --> 11213.6
foreign

11222.84 --> 11225.909
[Music]

11233.62 --> 11237.880000000001
it's just that it's against sex

11236.2 --> 11240.399000000001
addiction

11237.88 --> 11243.22
letter Sage

11240.399 --> 11246.099999999999
yeah you have to like read into that but

11243.22 --> 11250.019999999999
there is a pretty solid reason to not do

11246.1 --> 11250.02
that to do what Tara does

11250.12 --> 11255.279
it really does help like your inner

11253.3 --> 11257.56
mineral workings

11255.279 --> 11259.479000000001
sex is healthy

11257.56 --> 11261.819
it can be

11259.479 --> 11263.56
but if you overdo it and you don't do it

11261.819 --> 11266.278999999999
for the right reasons then it's not

11263.56 --> 11266.278999999999
super healthy

11267.279 --> 11271.12
yeah sex with somebody you love and you

11269.56 --> 11274.199999999999
want to have children with

11271.12 --> 11274.2
that's healthy

11274.54 --> 11280.660000000002
sex just because you want the sex you

11279.22 --> 11282.88
just want to come

11280.66 --> 11285.039999999999
it's not necessarily healthy it can

11282.88 --> 11287.319
actually like really screw up your

11285.04 --> 11290.640000000001
energy it can even hurt

11287.319 --> 11290.64
that's happened with me

11299.62 --> 11304.2
micro dosing huh okay

11315.399 --> 11319.319
they shouldn't have eaten the Apple

11323.68 --> 11328.62
yeah that's true

11325.72 --> 11328.619999999999
or colored

11329.08 --> 11332.8
you can lower your testosterone will

11330.819 --> 11334.84
over exhaust your balls effectively

11332.8 --> 11336.16
which is a most important source of

11334.84 --> 11338.58
testosterone

11336.16 --> 11338.58
okay

11338.92 --> 11344.2
by the way also constant sex also

11341.979 --> 11347.679999999998
influences men even if it is with women

11344.2 --> 11351.12
yeah just actual sex addiction whether

11347.68 --> 11355.54
it's prostitutes or non-prostitutes

11351.12 --> 11357.220000000001
also leads to lower testosterone why

11355.54 --> 11360.960000000001
because you're continually getting

11357.22 --> 11360.96
exposed to female hormones

11363.1 --> 11368.1
and that also influences your

11365.319 --> 11368.1
testosterone

11368.8 --> 11374.56
I mean it's if you look at it on a

11371.439 --> 11377.14
hormone base in the hormone balance

11374.56 --> 11379.72
situation it's like the men basically

11377.14 --> 11382.18
build a testosterone until they lose

11379.72 --> 11383.199999999999
control and just go like a bull on a

11382.18 --> 11386.319
woman

11383.2 --> 11388.0
right sort of if there there's women

11386.319 --> 11391.899
that are like that they like that they

11388.0 --> 11394.66
like a big chunky man that's like can't

11391.899 --> 11396.64
handle their own testosterone right but

11394.66 --> 11398.439
then those women tend to

11396.64 --> 11401.439
like

11398.439 --> 11404.14
lessen the pressure they not only like

11401.439 --> 11406.84
oh the bull pressure but also because of

11404.14 --> 11410.74
their hormones they influence those

11406.84 --> 11413.02
super beefy testosterone of men

11410.74 --> 11415.24
to basically

11413.02 --> 11418.54
take back take it back they literally

11415.24 --> 11420.46
extinguish the testosterone Peak

11418.54 --> 11422.640000000001
to calm them down

11420.46 --> 11425.56
to get them

11422.64 --> 11427.3
less likely to be physically abusive

11425.56 --> 11430.06
which does happen if you have like

11427.3 --> 11433.979
Overkill testosterone

11430.06 --> 11433.979
right it's a system

11434.38 --> 11439.3
so if you continually have sex with

11437.02 --> 11440.2
women because you're a sex addict like

11439.3 --> 11442.66
that

11440.2 --> 11444.1
even if you don't squirt on your own if

11442.66 --> 11446.5
you go with women you're still going to

11444.1 --> 11448.359
have all those hormones influencing you

11446.5 --> 11450.72
all the time it's not gonna be healthy

11448.359 --> 11450.720000000001
for you

11452.62 --> 11455.62
foreign

11456.96 --> 11461.339999999998
that's terrible clammy don't do that

11461.439 --> 11466.439
I mean this is getting too sick this is

11463.479 --> 11466.438999999998
12 plus guys

11467.8 --> 11472.358999999999
so please take keep that in mind don't

11470.2 --> 11476.1
take this too far here I'm gonna start

11472.359 --> 11476.1
to have the time you guys out

11476.26 --> 11479.939
that's arm's [ __ ] yeah

11480.64 --> 11483.358999999999
it's not good

11485.38 --> 11489.88
yeah if you're gonna go that yeah

11488.14 --> 11492.699999999999
but some people if they know what

11489.88 --> 11495.339999999998
they're doing it can work

11492.7 --> 11497.7
rest ads been into that he knows a lot

11495.34 --> 11497.7
about it

11499.3 --> 11503.92
but it doesn't matter whether you're

11501.399 --> 11506.019999999999
like artificially creating testosterone

11503.92 --> 11508.54
or stimulating your body to make it more

11506.02 --> 11510.460000000001
if you're high on testosterone if you

11508.54 --> 11513.399000000001
have a higher level

11510.46 --> 11515.319
then you tend to get more instinctual

11513.399 --> 11518.38
and like

11515.319 --> 11520.42
gonna go after the ladies that look the

11518.38 --> 11524.679999999998
right way

11520.42 --> 11527.14
and yeah and the women

11524.68 --> 11529.6
that you'll typically go for will have

11527.14 --> 11532.019999999999
like a counter hormonal reaction that

11529.6 --> 11535.92
will lessen that

11532.02 --> 11535.92
extremity a bit

11537.64 --> 11543.519999999999
anyway it's a good thing

11541.12 --> 11545.68
otherwise a lot of more women would

11543.52 --> 11547.899000000001
probably like accidentally get raped to

11545.68 --> 11549.52
death and [ __ ] because it's just beefy

11547.899 --> 11551.92
men that just can't handle themselves

11549.52 --> 11554.92
but because of that hormonal

11551.92 --> 11558.3
counterbalance that a woman does have

11554.92 --> 11558.3
that happens less

11558.58 --> 11564.039999999999
that's why some men really only can

11561.22 --> 11566.319
actually settle down and calm down after

11564.04 --> 11568.960000000001
they had sex with a woman

11566.319 --> 11570.76
that happens there's some of those types

11568.96 --> 11573.24
of men

11570.76 --> 11576.16
they're always Restless always like

11573.24 --> 11578.14
until they slept with a woman and then

11576.16 --> 11580.479
they actually suddenly really calm down

11578.14 --> 11583.479
and can really focused

11580.479 --> 11585.76
that's because of the hormone influence

11583.479 --> 11588.64
overall

11585.76 --> 11591.399
like extreme testosterone yeah it makes

11588.64 --> 11593.38
you smarter but it also like makes you

11591.399 --> 11595.18
more obsessively driven in a certain

11593.38 --> 11597.278999999999
direction

11595.18 --> 11599.880000000001
if that tones down a little you'll clear

11597.279 --> 11599.880000000001
up more

11600.39 --> 11603.41
[Music]

11607.479 --> 11611.46
[ __ ] tits come from what

11612.46 --> 11616.5
what the [ __ ] are you guys talking about

11620.859 --> 11626.5
access testosterone shrinks your junk

11624.399 --> 11628.899
yeah well that's if you're gonna go for

11626.5 --> 11631.92
steroids that typically does that

11628.899 --> 11631.92
n sarms

11635.08 --> 11640.779
test to estrogen

11637.96 --> 11643.0
what the right but no you don't need

11640.779 --> 11646.42
estrogen at all

11643.0 --> 11648.58
need to get rid of estrogen a man has no

11646.42 --> 11653.02
proper function for estrogen other than

11648.58 --> 11656.039999999999
to kill off his testosterone levels

11653.02 --> 11656.04
that's what it is

11667.06 --> 11672.278999999999
right that's the only reason estrogen

11669.1 --> 11675.1
exists basically for a man is to

11672.279 --> 11677.74
literally cut off his Peak testosterone

11675.1 --> 11679.66
because the more testosterone the more

11677.74 --> 11681.22
aggressive you'll become the more

11679.66 --> 11683.92
obsessive

11681.22 --> 11685.599999999999
and the less clear you'll think because

11683.92 --> 11687.52
you'll just have your obsession drive

11685.6 --> 11690.76
you everywhere

11687.52 --> 11693.52
so which is not necessarily good if men

11690.76 --> 11694.66
were just too full of testosterone all

11693.52 --> 11699.24
the time

11694.66 --> 11699.24
so but that's just how it works

11706.479 --> 11711.58
Is that real

11708.7 --> 11713.2
excess testosterone gets converted in

11711.58 --> 11715.899
estrogen

11713.2 --> 11719.34
really

11715.899 --> 11719.34
are you sure about that

11720.399 --> 11723.06
huh

11724.24 --> 11726.84
okay

11731.319 --> 11734.039999999999
hmm

11738.1 --> 11743.68
but doesn't it like normally happen like

11741.279 --> 11745.899000000001
even men that just normally have a lot

11743.68 --> 11746.92
of high testosterone are you sure about

11745.899 --> 11750.24
that

11746.92 --> 11753.58
isn't that just specifically about

11750.24 --> 11757.479
testosterone that's externally inserted

11753.58 --> 11759.64
are you sure it's not just that

11757.479 --> 11762.699999999999
so I mean there's like really high

11759.64 --> 11764.858999999999
testosterone guy men out there and I

11762.7 --> 11767.380000000001
don't think that they have like estrogen

11764.859 --> 11770.04
issues

11767.38 --> 11770.039999999999
so I'm

11771.34 --> 11776.380000000001
abusers

11773.439 --> 11779.279
right so yeah I thought so that so yeah

11776.38 --> 11782.8
we're on the same track it's like if you

11779.279 --> 11785.62
inject it externally

11782.8 --> 11788.8
it can basically go bad and turn into

11785.62 --> 11790.899000000001
estrogen instead but if you produce the

11788.8 --> 11793.0
estrogen in your body that doesn't

11790.899 --> 11794.858999999999
happen I don't think it does happen it

11793.0 --> 11798.54
only happens externally

11794.859 --> 11798.54
right we're on the same track

11805.3 --> 11811.438999999998
yeah zap tappy that's what you get when

11808.479 --> 11811.438999999998
you wear glasses

11814.06 --> 11816.22
yeah

11815.08 --> 11818.68
I mean

11816.22 --> 11821.08
every bit of gay

11818.68 --> 11823.42
ever been a gay decision that carries

11821.08 --> 11826.18
throughout your life yeah it does create

11823.42 --> 11828.52
a natural imbalance in your testosterone

11826.18 --> 11831.04
it does actually make you gay weakness

11828.52 --> 11833.74
literally makes you gay

11831.04 --> 11836.800000000001
so let's Loop it way back to the

11833.74 --> 11840.039999999999
beginning of this conversation

11836.8 --> 11844.06
I have no doubt you have some imbalance

11840.04 --> 11845.92
Within your estrogen system without any

11844.06 --> 11847.72
external use

11845.92 --> 11850.08
but that's because you wear glasses at

11847.72 --> 11850.08
happy

11863.859 --> 11873.479000000001
I'm not abstaining chroma okay

[Music]

11940.42 --> 11945.279
our contracts gay

11943.5 --> 11949.979
depends on

11945.279 --> 11949.979000000001
the nature of the contract letter Sage

11950.979 --> 11958.119999999999
I mean if you sign a contract like yeah

11955.3 --> 11962.14
you will get paid under these conditions

11958.12 --> 11965.439
like you have to follow the latest thing

11962.14 --> 11969.519999999999
like you're about to you're obligated

11965.439 --> 11972.04
to like attain the opinion of the

11969.52 --> 11975.52
company the official opinion if you sign

11972.04 --> 11978.779
a contract for that yeah you're gay

11975.52 --> 11978.779
definitely gay

11981.88 --> 11987.64
but it's because the corporation that

11985.12 --> 11991.68

11987.64 --> 11991.68
you're gay for becoming part of that

12025.68 --> 12029.58

you're gay if you're going to be angry

12885.68 --> 12892.800000000001
the show yeah I'm sure you did it's been

12890.04 --> 12895.26
interesting at least I got a title why

12892.8 --> 12897.179999999998
wearing glasses is gay

12895.26 --> 12899.399
I think that's very

12897.18 --> 12901.76
I think that's gonna probably get some

12899.399 --> 12901.76
attention

12906.6 --> 12910.16
for our secretly trolls

12910.2 --> 12916.739000000001
up your show no I does not

12914.819 --> 12918.26
cool versus just a Google virus he's

12916.739 --> 12920.279
like the least

12918.26 --> 12922.380000000001
mean-spirited troll I've ever come

12920.279 --> 12924.779
across the other thing that really makes

12922.38 --> 12926.88
him a troll is that when you try to like

12924.779 --> 12928.859
really make it get through to him that

12926.88 --> 12930.599999999999
the Earth is not a ball that's when he

12928.859 --> 12931.800000000001
gets the that's when he gets really

12930.6 --> 12934.319
trolley

12931.8 --> 12937.14
but overall I don't think he's like a a

12934.319 --> 12939.6
mean-spirited or person that has any

12937.14 --> 12942.06
level of sadism in him

12939.6 --> 12944.279
I don't think he's like that he's just

12942.06 --> 12946.08
he gets really annoying and he's really

12944.279 --> 12948.6
volunted

12946.08 --> 12950.34
but he's not really like a Troll he's

12948.6 --> 12952.62
just like a guy that just doesn't really

12950.34 --> 12954.84
give a [ __ ] and he's like

12952.62 --> 12956.279
he doesn't it doesn't matter to him if

12954.84 --> 12957.960000000001
things get rough he doesn't really

12956.279 --> 12960.479000000001
change

12957.96 --> 12964.46
it doesn't get scared away from that

12960.479 --> 12964.46
he's not overly sensitive

12972.54 --> 12977.880000000001
but I mean yeah when akumo viruses with

12975.42 --> 12981.18
other anti-flat earthers and Ballers he

12977.88 --> 12983.22
will talk [ __ ] about flat earthers

12981.18 --> 12985.56
but he will actually if you listen

12983.22 --> 12987.899
carefully in in other Ballers anti-flat

12985.56 --> 12990.899
earthers name names like Nathan Oakley

12987.899 --> 12993.019999999999
or Arwin you will you will find that he

12990.899 --> 12995.76
actually sticks up for us

12993.02 --> 12998.939
he actually does or at least he sticks

12995.76 --> 13002.979
up for me I've heard him do that so the

12998.939 --> 13002.979000000001
cool virus really isn't all that bad

13008.479 --> 13013.34
unlike moxie

13010.88 --> 13015.619999999999
he's all friendly here but he will talk

13013.34 --> 13018.8
[ __ ] just to be popular around under

13015.62 --> 13021.220000000001
anti-flatter trolls in other shows he

13018.8 --> 13024.819
will do that

13021.22 --> 13024.819
virus doesn't do that

13031.34 --> 13038.319
right anyway I'm definitely gonna round

13033.56 --> 13038.319
out now after three hours and 33 minutes

13039.859 --> 13045.08
it's been an epic run

13041.6 --> 13048.5
a bit over the place with a lot of fun

13045.08 --> 13050.899
a couple of bitter moments in the end

13048.5 --> 13053.6
really disappointed by the ioco guy I

13050.899 --> 13056.06
mean I thought it was kind of cool

13053.6 --> 13059.92
until I barely confronted him without

13056.06 --> 13059.92
having a gay daughter is not okay

13065.54 --> 13069.859
anyway

13067.04 --> 13071.720000000001
