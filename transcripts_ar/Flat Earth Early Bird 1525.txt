7.72 --> 37.6
[Music]

69.439 --> 74.17999999999999

appreciated I can always use the support

105.18 --> 111.06
right so yeah I'm starting over an hour

108.78 --> 112.5
late today also because there's no

111.06 --> 115.32000000000001
flatters debates

112.5 --> 117.979
weather today however is absolutely

115.32 --> 117.979
amazing

118.86 --> 124.86
it's been been kind of just like

122.64 --> 128.34
enjoying the weather because it's like

124.86 --> 130.88
perfect clear blue sky is even the moon

128.34 --> 130.88
out there

131.58 --> 135.959
and it's actually nice and warm outside

134.04 --> 138.66
well

135.959 --> 141.66
unless like a bit of wind comes by and

138.66 --> 144.18
then you freeze up so the wind is really

141.66 --> 148.7
cold but

144.18 --> 148.70000000000002
just the sun it's really nice

148.8 --> 154.58
I bet a lot of people are sitting behind

151.02 --> 154.58
their Windows just soaking it up

167.819 --> 170.819
right

173.879 --> 177.67999999999998
so yeah starting an hour late

177.92 --> 184.55999999999997
because I slept in like a lot I actually

182.06 --> 187.459
got out of bed and then it turned out to

184.56 --> 187.459
be after one

188.16 --> 195.019
I don't know it was just this morning

189.86 --> 195.019
with this weather it felt really great

196.08 --> 199.76000000000002
and it was like very dreamy

200.9 --> 207.659
so yeah and then it turns out that

203.819 --> 209.64
Nathan Oakley was sick and reported

207.659 --> 211.739
in Skype

209.64 --> 216.07999999999998
and so I thought okay well I'll just

211.739 --> 216.08
start an hour later and go on

218.34 --> 224.06
why not

219.72 --> 224.06
there's not going to be a live fed

224.34 --> 229.099
right so I do hope people are gonna show

226.86 --> 229.09900000000002
up

231.299 --> 234.14000000000001
I'm kind of late

235.2 --> 239.42
people yesterday also showed up late

239.84 --> 244.86
so it might be just in the air like a

242.7 --> 247.319
recovery sleep

244.86 --> 251.72000000000003
type of Cycles

247.319 --> 251.72
hey hello tiger bear first and chat

266.71 --> 270.419
[Music]

268.259 --> 275.84000000000003
all right so yeah yesterday's flatters

270.419 --> 275.84
debate was epic was a two-hour live show

277.38 --> 282.71999999999997
or over two hours even

280.199 --> 285.0
but then yeah Nathan did start already

282.72 --> 289.02000000000004
start to sound kind of sickish like he

285.0 --> 290.58
had a cold like his nose was a bit

289.02 --> 293.29999999999995
stuffy

290.58 --> 293.3
at the end

294.84 --> 300.65999999999997
so yeah he apparently is now sick in bed

298.919 --> 302.27
so

300.66 --> 305.37
be it

302.27 --> 305.37
[Music]

305.759 --> 309.54
he definitely deserves a break I mean

307.68 --> 311.34000000000003
that live show yesterday was pretty

309.54 --> 315.6
intense

311.34 --> 317.21999999999997
and really funny too by the way we had

315.6 --> 319.56
so much fun it was

317.22 --> 322.91900000000004
we're just joking around and still

319.56 --> 327.5
keeping focused nobody got really pissed

322.919 --> 327.5
off or anything at all it was great

329.09 --> 332.279
[Music]

334.139 --> 337.139
right

337.639 --> 342.5
anyway let's see what else was I doing

342.78 --> 345.73999999999995
uh

346.199 --> 352.58000000000004
oh yeah caught a bit of flat Zoid

349.74 --> 352.58
that was fun

362.78 --> 365.78
thank you

371.4 --> 377.539
still dreaming about the game in my mind

375.0 --> 377.539
like

378.18 --> 384.5
it's even a partially just like trying

380.34 --> 384.5
to identify what the dream actually is

388.919 --> 393.78
but yeah

390.96 --> 396.59999999999997
I should like try to just derive as much

393.78 --> 399.29999999999995
from it as I can effectively before it

396.6 --> 402.24
starts dying down

399.3 --> 404.34000000000003
and then see what I got

402.24 --> 407.58
so I actually have been thinking of even

404.34 --> 410.46
taking a few days off

407.58 --> 413.69899999999996
and because when I'm inspired like this

410.46 --> 416.34
I can definitely divert energy for well

413.699 --> 417.539
what I would normally be using for the

416.34 --> 420.29999999999995
show

417.539 --> 422.539
to actually getting creative I could do

420.3 --> 422.539
that

425.4 --> 431.15999999999997
yeah that's right tensor hello

427.919 --> 434.09999999999997
make notes my dreams before they forget

431.16 --> 435.66
although it's not like oh the dream of

434.1 --> 438.24
the night it's like I'm dreaming

435.66 --> 440.09900000000005
continually about it

438.24 --> 442.139
but I know that's gonna stop at some

440.099 --> 444.24
point

442.139 --> 448.57
so I have to like

444.24 --> 449.94
study it and

448.57 --> 452.819
[Music]

449.94 --> 454.56
well build build a pattern

452.819 --> 456.84000000000003
for the game

454.56 --> 460.199
and I think as long as the structure is

456.84 --> 463.25899999999996
there with the context then even the

460.199 --> 465.18
exact visions that I'm getting will

463.259 --> 468.539
become irrelevant because they will

465.18 --> 471.479
naturally then form out of the creation

468.539 --> 474.5
of the script when it's actually being

471.479 --> 474.5
made into a game

474.84 --> 478.919
so I gotta keep focusing on the

476.819 --> 481.38
structure and in general like even if

478.919 --> 483.479
the entire project fails as like oh

481.38 --> 486.02
baller's gate you can't get the rights

483.479 --> 488.21999999999997
or whatever or something

486.02 --> 490.74
won't work out

488.22 --> 493.68
then at least I got an actual structure

490.74 --> 495.90000000000003
for well a game of this type

493.68 --> 499.02
which I'm very interested in and I think

495.9 --> 503.17999999999995
that like this

499.02 --> 503.18
game type like Baldur's Gate

503.639 --> 508.68
could be

505.199 --> 510.18
like its own Universe like d d i mean I

508.68 --> 513.3
thought it was the most successful

510.18 --> 516.14
application of a Dungeons and Dragons

513.3 --> 516.14
universe

516.599 --> 522.1400000000001
because it's so story driven not just

519.3 --> 522.14
hacker slash

527.22 --> 533.82
right so I play the games to study what

532.44 --> 536.9590000000001
it is

533.82 --> 542.48
and why it works

536.959 --> 542.4799999999999
and how simple it actually is

543.779 --> 546.4399999999999
foreign

546.8 --> 551.88
like the actual artists feeling and like

550.26 --> 553.98
the voice actors what they do with it

551.88 --> 557.66
because they really make every moment

553.98 --> 557.66
into a special moment of its own

562.86 --> 568.8000000000001
right but the overall planning of how

566.399 --> 571.019
the game is wrote it like where you

568.8 --> 575.0999999999999
gotta go

571.019 --> 578.64
how the storyline connects up like that

575.1 --> 582.24
thing is relatively pretty simple

578.64 --> 585.899
but the story really needs to be put

582.24 --> 588.42
there in order for it all to to actually

585.899 --> 590.16
be compelling in any kind of way

588.42 --> 595.5
if it's just

590.16 --> 597.6
like a more online type RPGs

595.5 --> 600.42
it's just oh you walk over to the person

597.6 --> 603.5
you get the quest you go over there you

600.42 --> 603.5
meet the other person

604.2 --> 609.3000000000001
and then you don't end up really caring

606.959 --> 611.279
right it it just becomes like you go

609.3 --> 613.279
from one to the other and you just start

611.279 --> 616.98
hacking and then you level up and

613.279 --> 618.899
there's no the story really then starts

616.98 --> 621.24
to become like not even secondary

618.899 --> 623.459
tertiary it just becomes completely

621.24 --> 627.5
irrelevant to the player well the

623.459 --> 627.5
bubbles get that's not possible

631.14 --> 635.519
I mean you could still do that but

633.12 --> 639.36
you're still going to be wrapped in the

635.519 --> 641.88
story because well voice acting

639.36 --> 643.6800000000001
they will say it you will hear it

641.88 --> 646.2
whether you're paying attention or not

643.68 --> 648.5999999999999
like but you're it's not like a piece of

646.2 --> 650.279
text you could just like click quickly

648.6 --> 652.26
click through so you don't see any of it

650.279 --> 655.98
like you're gonna actually hear the

652.26 --> 660.14
story being said partially parts of it

655.98 --> 660.14
even if you run try to run through it

661.44 --> 665.399
it's different anyway

663.12 --> 667.98
it's just the dynamic of the experience

665.399 --> 669.779
it's very well tinkered

667.98 --> 672.4200000000001
in ways

669.779 --> 677.6
within the relatively simple setup

672.42 --> 677.5999999999999
confine right and there is like I mean

683.64 --> 689.279
in order for it to really progress

686.16 --> 691.98
properly in the game

689.279 --> 693.54
the mechanics have to be further

691.98 --> 695.339
developed

693.54 --> 698.04
but not

695.339 --> 700.62
too dramatic like not in the way that

698.04 --> 703.079
Baldur's Gate treated it's completely

700.62 --> 707.12
rearranges system and introduced all

703.079 --> 707.12
kinds of weird wild niches and

707.16 --> 713.519
and it became very clumsy like

711.06 --> 714.959
doing something should be just pressing

713.519 --> 717.36
one button

714.959 --> 720.1199999999999
not like going through a menu to click

717.36 --> 721.62
click like this right because then you

720.12 --> 723.24
get lost

721.62 --> 725.519
has to be quick

723.24 --> 727.44
all right so there was interface issues

725.519 --> 728.88
we probably get three but with bothers

727.44 --> 731.22
gate 2 that you did not have those

728.88 --> 733.86
issues at all it was all very quick and

731.22 --> 735.899
intuitive and you you had quick menus

733.86 --> 739.519
but I never even used them because it

735.899 --> 739.519
was already quick enough to me

739.62 --> 743.9590000000001
right

741.42 --> 743.959
anyway

745.579 --> 750.019
I'm swimming in it right now

750.24 --> 754.5
do I know any other game designers that

752.279 --> 757.399
can bounce ideas off

754.5 --> 757.399
not really

757.74 --> 760.88
I've known a few

761.04 --> 767.04
there's one guy that made his own RPG

763.56 --> 769.4399999999999
system was this extremely elaborate but

767.04 --> 771.7199999999999
it's like nothing at all like the Indie

769.44 --> 775.2600000000001
and the guy didn't like DND

771.72 --> 776.88
he hated it he even refused to play in

775.26 --> 780.36
the in my group

776.88 --> 783.079
because of DnD so I'm not he's not going

780.36 --> 783.0790000000001
to be my juice

795.44 --> 803.339
but I've even been thinking about okay

799.139 --> 807.48
could I potentially implement

803.339 --> 810.5400000000001
like atrials and Tyrant systems

807.48 --> 812.639
with how my spells work and the classes

810.54 --> 815.519
I mean that would be freaking amazing

812.639 --> 817.98
and it is technically DnD 3.5 it would

815.519 --> 819.6
be seen as such with just some slight

817.98 --> 821.339
modifications so it would be very

819.6 --> 825.1800000000001
recognizable

821.339 --> 826.9200000000001
even for the game designers

825.18 --> 829.26
who are going to basically trying to

826.92 --> 832.3389999999999
balance it out right and my spell system

829.26 --> 832.3389999999999
is very balanced

835.079 --> 842.459
but then because of how complicated it's

839.459 --> 845.459
still is especially like trying to pick

842.459 --> 848.579
Feats and all that as always like with

845.459 --> 851.2199999999999
every freaking DND game except Baldur's

848.579 --> 853.579
Gate because they had didn't have Beats

851.22 --> 853.5790000000001
like that

854.579 --> 859.3199999999999
and and you couldn't really get too lost

857.16 --> 861.899
into them as it were

859.32 --> 864.5400000000001
right there should be a much more

861.899 --> 867.12
efficient way of picking feats

864.54 --> 868.8
where you can always see like how you

867.12 --> 871.26
can attain a fee

868.8 --> 874.519
so you're that it becomes like picking

871.26 --> 874.519
in a giant skill tree

874.62 --> 879.66
that kind of oversight instead of just a

877.38 --> 881.76
list of endless amounts of Feats and yet

879.66 --> 885.42
you don't even

881.76 --> 887.279
know what half of them do and some you

885.42 --> 889.019
can't get to so you don't see them so

887.279 --> 890.82
then how the hell do you even know they

889.019 --> 893.76
exist and you could build towards them

890.82 --> 896.88
all these kinds of issues with the

893.76 --> 898.139
representation of Feats in all DND type

896.88 --> 900.36
games

898.139 --> 903.54
that really are based on Dungeons and

900.36 --> 906.0600000000001
Dragons with Feats and I think that

903.54 --> 909.8389999999999
that is all really changed around though

906.06 --> 911.399
after like for dne4 so whatever they're

909.839 --> 913.74
using out there now I don't even

911.399 --> 915.839
recognize it anymore I don't feel that's

913.74 --> 918.86
even DND I think that's like a [ __ ]

915.839 --> 918.86
version of DnD

919.019 --> 925.699
and hey players seem to love it

922.86 --> 925.6990000000001
I don't

927.079 --> 931.9799999999999
I like the more complicated elaborate

930.0 --> 934.92
version but

931.98 --> 938.399
if you gamify it then you have to make

934.92 --> 940.92
it like really simple and over easy to

938.399 --> 943.86
oversee on how to use it

940.92 --> 945.899
or people will get stuck and just pick

943.86 --> 948.32
stupid things and then not have great

945.899 --> 948.32
characters

948.72 --> 952.5600000000001
because they're either too impatient to

950.579 --> 955.62
figure it out

952.56 --> 958.5
or it's just

955.62 --> 962.0
they can't really see what the point of

958.5 --> 962.0
it is when you pick it

964.86 --> 970.94
right anyway I'm just thinking a lot

967.74 --> 970.94
about interface

972.779 --> 977.04
hello Stevie traveler I don't know if

975.12 --> 979.44
you guys I think that a lot of you guys

977.04 --> 981.3
are are actually not really into what

979.44 --> 983.22
I'm talking about

981.3 --> 985.26
and I'm sorry for that

983.22 --> 989.279
it's just that

985.26 --> 992.22
this thing kind of overcame me

989.279 --> 994.32
and I really am a game designer at heart

992.22 --> 997.44
in many ways

994.32 --> 998.639
it's like more even than like a

997.44 --> 1002.36
Goldsmith

998.639 --> 1005.74
dude I was literally making board games

1002.36 --> 1005.74
when I was like eight

1007.339 --> 1014.899
with rules and everything and all kinds

1012.019 --> 1017.24
I was making games games games all the

1014.899 --> 1019.519
freaking Time games on computers games

1017.24 --> 1022.16
board games

1019.519 --> 1025.819
I think I even made

1022.16 --> 1028.76
no no no I don't think I completed that

1025.819 --> 1031.52
well we did like even make

1028.76 --> 1033.079
our own magic cards but I mean oh that's

1031.52 --> 1036.3799999999999
special yeah

1033.079 --> 1039.62
but I did it before there was like an

1036.38 --> 1042.74
easy way to just have a cookie cutter

1039.62 --> 1047.079
thing design happening and print it out

1042.74 --> 1047.079
which is I just drew it on on paper

1047.36 --> 1052.76
but I had like an entire magic deck of

1049.82 --> 1056.299
just made cards based on characters that

1052.76 --> 1059.12
we knew with our friend Circle

1056.299 --> 1062.84
that kind of thing it's always making

1059.12 --> 1064.76
games me so this is like a bit of a

1062.84 --> 1068.6
Revival because I hadn't have haven't

1064.76 --> 1070.94
had any real serious project

1068.6 --> 1074.0
since

1070.94 --> 1077.24
like an actual design based project not

1074.0 --> 1080.179
not DND but not game mastering because

1077.24 --> 1082.82
game mastering is really using it using

1080.179 --> 1084.5
what's there and improvising as a game

1082.82 --> 1087.3799999999999
master figuring out a lot of psychology

1084.5 --> 1089.84
goes into it it's different

1087.38 --> 1092.2990000000002
actual designing

1089.84 --> 1094.76
like my trolls and tyrants book that

1092.299 --> 1098.3799999999999
that was well a huge project probably

1094.76 --> 1098.3799999999999
the biggest I've ever tackled

1098.6 --> 1103.28
I mean it's like a thousand Pages or

1101.36 --> 1105.62
something it's crazy

1103.28 --> 1107.6
I still keep looking through it and get

1105.62 --> 1110.2399999999998
dazzled I did it again yesterday I just

1107.6 --> 1114.3799999999999
look through it and it's like

1110.24 --> 1117.08
whoa just the freaking sheer amount of

1114.38 --> 1119.0
details in the rules that I added to

1117.08 --> 1122.4189999999999
like the abilities in it and like

1119.0 --> 1125.48
thinking of everything it's it blows my

1122.419 --> 1128.24
mind how freaking detailed I made it

1125.48 --> 1130.52
and there's still like incomplete little

1128.24 --> 1132.02
thingies

1130.52 --> 1135.039
but

1132.02 --> 1138.44
it's like a minor dent in things because

1135.039 --> 1142.4
the main issues have all been

1138.44 --> 1146.0
fixed like any exploitable holes in

1142.4 --> 1149.0590000000002
there are sealed in like everything

1146.0 --> 1151.88
that's crazy

1149.059 --> 1154.3999999999999
to have sealed all the real holes in

1151.88 --> 1156.6200000000001
like a thousand pages of text of

1154.4 --> 1159.3200000000002
technical rules

1156.62 --> 1163.1
that all reference like all the other

1159.32 --> 1165.2
technical rules too

1163.1 --> 1167.12
I mean the whole thing is basically

1165.2 --> 1170.48
based on

1167.12 --> 1174.82
a giant set of books

1170.48 --> 1174.82
more way more than a thousand pages

1179.66 --> 1186.7
huh

1181.46 --> 1186.7
hello Aries 106 good to you Terry 306

1189.74 --> 1194.74
keyboard keys were missing

1192.26 --> 1194.74
oh

1197.059 --> 1201.02
that's a typical dream

1202.4 --> 1208.4
sounds like you might get some

1205.52 --> 1209.96
increased temper maybe because of the

1208.4 --> 1212.26
spring and your dream is warning about

1209.96 --> 1212.26
it

1221.72 --> 1225.94
with what kind of mind should

1226.76 --> 1232.64
with what kind of mind you should design

1229.34 --> 1235.28
some game board games or what that's a

1232.64 --> 1237.26
weirdly constructing sentence but

1235.28 --> 1239.5
what kind of mindset do you need to do

1237.26 --> 1239.5
that

1239.72 --> 1244.52
well

1241.34 --> 1248.559
you need to like playing board games and

1244.52 --> 1248.559
then just look at what makes it fun

1248.919 --> 1254.48
it's re really most of it is about

1251.98 --> 1256.96
rearranging systems that are already

1254.48 --> 1256.96
there

1258.46 --> 1264.46
and always about making things not too

1261.98 --> 1264.46
complicated

1269.299 --> 1273.1399999999999
because

1270.919 --> 1275.6000000000001
yeah if a game board becomes really

1273.14 --> 1277.2800000000002
complicated then it becomes very Niche

1275.6 --> 1279.32
type of game and then the amount of

1277.28 --> 1283.059
chemistry social chemistry that can be

1279.32 --> 1283.059
possible will become very limited

1288.799 --> 1293.6
which by the way accounts for DND as

1290.9 --> 1296.8600000000001
well but I mean the fun thing with a

1293.6 --> 1296.86
really good game master is

1297.52 --> 1304.22
they can still be make a good game with

1301.4 --> 1306.679
a player as long as they can just get

1304.22 --> 1308.96
into the story and you have to then

1306.679 --> 1311.7800000000002
provide that story actually for them to

1308.96 --> 1313.76
make it worth to them for without them

1311.78 --> 1315.5
actually being too much into the

1313.76 --> 1316.82
technicals

1315.5 --> 1318.799
I mean there's always going to be

1316.82 --> 1323.36
another player that will be very well

1318.799 --> 1326.24
willing to to assist in like character

1323.36 --> 1328.3999999999999
design choices and all that right

1326.24 --> 1331.82
because that's something that's a lot of

1328.4 --> 1333.679
players love to do but others don't and

1331.82 --> 1335.6589999999999
some don't even really know too much

1333.679 --> 1337.88
about the game they just really get into

1335.659 --> 1339.6200000000001
the universe and they'll just be like uh

1337.88 --> 1341.48
what should I do

1339.62 --> 1343.82
like is this possible

1341.48 --> 1347.1200000000001
and and they'll figure it out as playing

1343.82 --> 1349.34
instead of like by what the reading the

1347.12 --> 1351.32
rules that's how I figured it out I

1349.34 --> 1353.4189999999999
didn't read all the rules I would just

1351.32 --> 1357.6399999999999
kept asking I would just try it like

1353.419 --> 1357.64
what can I do can I use this now

1357.86 --> 1365.1789999999999
and then get eventually the feel of like

1361.159 --> 1366.8600000000001
what the purpose of everything is

1365.179 --> 1370.94
and then later

1366.86 --> 1373.039
I would get when I like really started

1370.94 --> 1374.96
to get it that's when I then start to

1373.039 --> 1377.78
like cross-reference it with the actual

1374.96 --> 1379.46
rules to really solidify it I didn't

1377.78 --> 1382.58
start out reading the rules because

1379.46 --> 1384.32
that's just gibberish to me at first

1382.58 --> 1386.539
it's like all technical things about

1384.32 --> 1390.7
something that you don't you've never

1386.539 --> 1390.7
experienced so it's like what

1393.2 --> 1398.6000000000001
with all kinds of technical terms

1396.38 --> 1401.96
right that you don't you're not used to

1398.6 --> 1405.86
so that that's just unreadable unless

1401.96 --> 1407.96
you're really good at reading manuals if

1405.86 --> 1410.4799999999998
you're really like that if you're like a

1407.96 --> 1411.919
real manual guy I mean d d is really

1410.48 --> 1414.02
awesome

1411.919 --> 1415.5800000000002
because there's freaking detailed rules

1414.02 --> 1418.22
for everything and hey if you're like

1415.58 --> 1421.1589999999999
that you'll love my book If You Like

1418.22 --> 1423.14
Love DND because everything in there is

1421.159 --> 1425.2990000000002
about rules I mean it's like oh you have

1423.14 --> 1427.22
an ability anybody said oh you do this

1425.299 --> 1430.28
and that pretty simple reference

1427.22 --> 1432.799
description oh here's the other details

1430.28 --> 1435.1399999999999
then there's another block a text that

1432.799 --> 1436.58
says how it all connects up and the

1435.14 --> 1438.0200000000002
exceptions

1436.58 --> 1440.8999999999999
and

1438.02 --> 1442.7
like even how it develops later when you

1440.9 --> 1446.659
get other abilities

1442.7 --> 1448.5800000000002
in the same class Etc like a lot of very

1446.659 --> 1450.74
specific detail

1448.58 --> 1453.6399999999999
it's like everything is like a contract

1450.74 --> 1453.64
everything

1454.1 --> 1459.76
right so if you're into that you'll love

1456.26 --> 1459.76
my trolls and tyrants book

1462.74 --> 1470.72
first Illuminati oh make a game about it

1467.179 --> 1473.96
dude you can literally do that in DND

1470.72 --> 1476.48
do you know how freaking easy that is

1473.96 --> 1478.4
to do that

1476.48 --> 1482.24
there's

1478.4 --> 1485.96
already deities fully developed and

1482.24 --> 1488.419
classes in order to do that and you can

1485.96 --> 1493.1000000000001
make it about that like you could just

1488.419 --> 1496.24
make a game in D in D about that

1493.1 --> 1496.24
very easily

1500.0 --> 1504.32
and I bet there's even already kind of

1502.64 --> 1508.4
like

1504.32 --> 1510.98
game modifications by people in that

1508.4 --> 1513.74
setting out there I mean

1510.98 --> 1516.64
it's been kind of popularized for some

1513.74 --> 1516.64
time now so

1516.74 --> 1523.28
and in Illuminati in d d is like a

1520.82 --> 1526.6589999999999
common thing that sort of [ __ ] happens

1523.28 --> 1526.6589999999999
in almost every game

1528.94 --> 1532.0
all right

1546.34 --> 1552.32
strategic Karma now

1549.559 --> 1556.94
I I'm not into that

1552.32 --> 1559.3999999999999
I'm not into those types of games sorry

1556.94 --> 1561.559
dude there's so many of those types of

1559.4 --> 1563.3600000000001
games out there endless amount I'm just

1561.559 --> 1565.279
not into them I mean

1563.36 --> 1567.1999999999998
there's like a

1565.279 --> 1568.94
party or something and there's a bunch

1567.2 --> 1572.6000000000001
of nerds and they bring out those cards

1568.94 --> 1575.74
yeah sure I'll play it sometime you know

1572.6 --> 1579.02
but that's just

1575.74 --> 1582.88
occasional or whatever but you play man

1579.02 --> 1582.8799999999999
dude I haven't played magic in

1583.34 --> 1587.059
real

1584.84 --> 1588.9189999999999
over a decade

1587.059 --> 1593.24
I don't really play Magic anymore

1588.919 --> 1596.2990000000002
because the last time I checked the The

1593.24 --> 1598.279
Gamers were playing that yeah in that

1596.299 --> 1601.4
location that were playing Magic while

1598.279 --> 1603.02
playing Magic like 20 years later with

1601.4 --> 1605.9
completely different rules and the game

1603.02 --> 1608.98
is all completely [ __ ] up so the only

1605.9 --> 1612.8600000000001
way I will ever play Magic probably now

1608.98 --> 1616.9
is with my decks I have several Decks

1612.86 --> 1616.8999999999999
that can play against each other

1617.779 --> 1620.559
that's it

1623.659 --> 1629.0
if you like playing Magic the Gathering

1626.179 --> 1632.659
the old-fashioned way

1629.0 --> 1635.12
then you can play it with my decks

1632.659 --> 1637.1000000000001
that's it

1635.12 --> 1639.34
but I haven't played it like in a long

1637.1 --> 1639.34
time

1640.36 --> 1645.34
I mean it's I just it runs out

1645.919 --> 1650.2990000000002
they ruined it

1648.02 --> 1654.44
Magic the Gathering ruined it they just

1650.299 --> 1656.179
pumped they over inflated everything

1654.44 --> 1658.94
and like

1656.179 --> 1662.299
new cards are

1658.94 --> 1665.48
like even the normal ones are so

1662.299 --> 1668.48
freaking powerful seriously that it

1665.48 --> 1671.6
makes like super expensive

1668.48 --> 1674.6
rare cards from old

1671.6 --> 1679.48
from the old uh decks from the old

1674.6 --> 1679.48
series just completely useless

1680.419 --> 1685.279
so they completely ruined Magic the

1682.46 --> 1687.6200000000001
Gathering and yeah everybody still or

1685.279 --> 1689.179
the ones that still play it went along

1687.62 --> 1692.36
with all that

1689.179 --> 1694.64
and so it's nothing like what I got

1692.36 --> 1698.02
nothing like that at all my my magic

1694.64 --> 1698.0200000000002
decks are stuck in time

1699.62 --> 1706.84
and I play by my rules which are the old

1702.98 --> 1706.84
rules in a way very simple

1711.62 --> 1716.539
The Witcher is also about the Illuminati

1714.44 --> 1720.44
okay yeah

1716.539 --> 1723.1
sure it is the mean that concept is not

1720.44 --> 1723.1000000000001
freaking new

1730.279 --> 1734.419
five sets of here cases

1732.88 --> 1737.7990000000002
[Music]

1734.419 --> 1741.679
too far yeah it's it's

1737.799 --> 1746.1399999999999
absolutely atrocious

1741.679 --> 1746.14
it's really [ __ ] up that they do it

1746.779 --> 1751.039
they're literally prostituting their

1748.94 --> 1755.44
entire game and it's nothing like it

1751.039 --> 1755.44
used to be it's all just out of control

1758.48 --> 1764.44
I mean if I were them I'd go for a reset

1765.74 --> 1770.48
but then

1767.779 --> 1772.64
yeah I mean they look they can still

1770.48 --> 1774.5
keep going but I mean eventually like

1772.64 --> 1776.48
people are gonna like be like yeah

1774.5 --> 1779.14
nobody's playing this anymore why would

1776.48 --> 1779.14
I give a [ __ ]

1780.44 --> 1785.98
so they could like do a reset and

1782.659 --> 1788.779
basically say okay yeah all these things

1785.98 --> 1791.84
that in more recent times are all like

1788.779 --> 1794.86
negated now like we're gonna go back to

1791.84 --> 1794.86
older rules

1797.539 --> 1802.1
but I didn't it probably wouldn't work

1799.52 --> 1804.34
anymore it's been going on for way too

1802.1 --> 1804.34
long

1810.64 --> 1817.659
it's all been stretched Way Too Thin to

1814.159 --> 1817.659
to restore probably

1818.0 --> 1821.86
with magic the Gathering but whatever

1826.7 --> 1835.299
so much into card games so I'm into

1829.82 --> 1835.299
video games and in tabletop role playing

1849.62 --> 1855.5
the graveyard is another hand so much

1852.919 --> 1859.76
for covering about that

1855.5 --> 1862.399
well the graveyard another hand

1859.76 --> 1864.5
well recovery was always an interesting

1862.399 --> 1867.799
things like even in my time there were

1864.5 --> 1872.2
many recovery options

1867.799 --> 1872.2
but it wasn't easy

1872.96 --> 1879.8600000000001
I mean I have I have backslide I have a

1876.38 --> 1884.6000000000001
deck specifically built on ensuring to

1879.86 --> 1887.4189999999999
throw away like insanely large monsters

1884.6 --> 1889.8799999999999
and to then resurrect them very cheaply

1887.419 --> 1891.8600000000001
like I have a deck specifically built

1889.88 --> 1897.0390000000002
around that

1891.86 --> 1897.039
but the polar Kraken and the Colossus

1900.62 --> 1906.5
so that was even back then I mean dude

1903.5 --> 1909.14
what you can do dynamically

1906.5 --> 1912.38
with magic the Gathering was absolutely

1909.14 --> 1914.659
awesome and insane I've built really

1912.38 --> 1917.72
bizarre decks

1914.659 --> 1920.0590000000002
like I I invented that type of deck yeah

1917.72 --> 1921.64
like apparently that even kind of went

1920.059 --> 1924.6789999999999
around

1921.64 --> 1926.779
because I invented it nobody had thought

1924.679 --> 1929.48
of doing that like

1926.779 --> 1931.159
yeah first third what do you do I do

1929.48 --> 1935.059
nothing oh okay well throw away your

1931.159 --> 1938.8400000000001
card then okay polar Kraken next turn oh

1935.059 --> 1941.899
yeah land and here's a Mana artifact oh

1938.84 --> 1945.26
I'm resurrecting the polar Kraken oh

1941.899 --> 1948.8799999999999
oh you got an 11 11 trample creature in

1945.26 --> 1948.8799999999999
play now all of a sudden oh

1949.22 --> 1954.74
yeah next turn oh I sacrificed the land

1952.7 --> 1958.7
that I put into play

1954.74 --> 1961.299
I use the artifact to install energy to

1958.7 --> 1961.299
untap it

1962.24 --> 1966.6200000000001
or no wait I don't have to a tablet

1964.88 --> 1968.0590000000002
right it doesn't have it's a Colossus

1966.62 --> 1971.059
right

1968.059 --> 1973.36
and then it's just berserk so dead third

1971.059 --> 1973.36
turn

1976.88 --> 1982.6000000000001
because you're getting 22 trample damage

1978.98 --> 1982.6
on your ass anyway

1985.22 --> 1991.46
oh wait 24.

1988.94 --> 1994.279
anyway yeah it's a bit complicated it

1991.46 --> 1997.82
doesn't always work super quick but I'll

1994.279 --> 1999.26
some a lot of the times it does

1997.82 --> 2002.2
still have it

1999.26 --> 2006.279
Grave Digger decks I guess I did

2002.2 --> 2009.179
invent that yes let me show it I still

2006.279 --> 2009.179
have it assembled

2012.159 --> 2014.8200000000002
thank you

2014.88 --> 2017.999
[Music]

2039.76 --> 2045.6589999999999
right

2041.86 --> 2045.6589999999999
yeah there you go

2048.0 --> 2051.78
so yeah here it is

2051.94 --> 2055.139
polar Kraken

2061.06 --> 2064.679
I did actually update a bit

2067.899 --> 2071.379
all right here's also this one

2069.82 --> 2074.139
apparently

2071.379 --> 2076.899
cross and Cloud scraper which is from a

2074.139 --> 2079.599
little bit later generation but I still

2076.899 --> 2082.0
added some few like cards from later

2079.599 --> 2084.8790000000004
decks it's just at some point it just

2082.0 --> 2087.28
completely mutated like a decade ago and

2084.879 --> 2089.56
it's the new stuff is barely

2087.28 --> 2091.4190000000003
recognizable

2089.56 --> 2094.419
and then they started to look different

2091.419 --> 2096.52
to more like Pokemon cards so I have

2094.419 --> 2099.46
like the Poke when it started to look

2096.52 --> 2102.52
like Pokemon cards that's where I

2099.46 --> 2105.099
absolutely bitterly draw the line no

2102.52 --> 2108.359
cards after that are legal in My World

2105.099 --> 2108.3590000000004
of Magic the Gathering

2109.0 --> 2114.52
oh yeah

2110.8 --> 2117.6400000000003
yeah zombie infestation

2114.52 --> 2119.98
very you yeah

2117.64 --> 2122.02
discard two cards from your hand and you

2119.98 --> 2123.76
get a zombie but yeah I mean I need to

2122.02 --> 2126.28
discard card because I need huge

2123.76 --> 2129.1600000000003
creatures in my graveyard

2126.28 --> 2132.1600000000003
and I have dance of the Dead

2129.16 --> 2134.98
anime dead

2132.16 --> 2137.0989999999997
in still energy very very useful of

2134.98 --> 2137.099
course

2141.24 --> 2146.8199999999997
MOX diamond

2143.619 --> 2146.82
click Mana

2149.079 --> 2154.7200000000003
oh yeah this one very interesting a card

2152.5 --> 2156.46
like if you have one of these in your

2154.72 --> 2159.2799999999997
graveyard so this is also one you want

2156.46 --> 2161.98
to discard then you then all the others

2159.28 --> 2164.98
like this silly give you Mana of color

2161.98 --> 2164.98
uh

2166.66 --> 2170.2799999999997
let's see what else do they have in

2168.04 --> 2170.2799999999997
there

2173.14 --> 2177.24
oh yeah dragon scales

2177.4 --> 2181.859
so it doesn't have to tap and gets a

2179.26 --> 2181.8590000000004
little stronger

2184.98 --> 2192.06
here's an old one from Antiquities

2189.82 --> 2193.7200000000003
or aborig

2192.06 --> 2197.56
oh yeah

2193.72 --> 2199.9599999999996
balance it's a great great tool in this

2197.56 --> 2202.359
in this game

2199.96 --> 2205.7400000000002
and I don't have it restricted so

2202.359 --> 2205.74
because screw them

2205.839 --> 2209.2599999999998
uh

2207.4 --> 2212.28
yeah that's that's pretty much how this

2209.26 --> 2212.28
deck works right now

2213.28 --> 2217.3
it's a card game yeah it's called Magic

2215.5 --> 2220.119
the Gathering and we've been talking

2217.3 --> 2224.079
about it thanks to Ares 106.

2220.119 --> 2224.079
but I mean yeah

2235.48 --> 2240.3
I basically invented that style deck

2242.079 --> 2248.5600000000004
Mock's diamond is swipe no it isn't

2245.2 --> 2250.2
this is not one of the original mocks

2248.56 --> 2251.38
dude

2250.2 --> 2253.72
[Music]

2251.38 --> 2255.52
are you crazy I don't have any cards

2253.72 --> 2259.9599999999996
that are like over

2255.52 --> 2262.359
20 euros anymore I used to have them and

2259.96 --> 2264.78
then I sold them because I was [ __ ]

2262.359 --> 2264.7799999999997
poor

2265.599 --> 2267.78
thank you

2268.68 --> 2273.18
dude I had gauntlets of Might

2274.72 --> 2280.48
and probably this the

2277.72 --> 2282.8199999999997
saddest of letting them go that was a

2280.48 --> 2285.599
really valuable card and I had them

2282.82 --> 2285.599
pretty cheap even

2292.56 --> 2300.18
so Monk's diamond is definitely not

2296.64 --> 2300.18
500 dollars

2306.28 --> 2309.0600000000004
wait what

2310.839 --> 2313.92
wait what

2314.44 --> 2317.44
no

2331.26 --> 2334.92
what the [ __ ]

2339.54 --> 2344.859
holy [ __ ]

2342.22 --> 2347.5789999999997
you were right

2344.859 --> 2353.16
what the [ __ ]

2347.579 --> 2353.1600000000003
I I did not pay that for that

2353.64 --> 2356.8799999999997
holy [ __ ]

2360.48 --> 2366.18
no

2362.26 --> 2366.1800000000003
but that's crazy

2374.02 --> 2380.619
because these are not like

2376.119 --> 2385.079
from the old the old ones right

2380.619 --> 2385.079
this is just another card from another

2386.26 --> 2393.48
from this what is this series but yeah I

2389.5 --> 2393.48
have four of those what the [ __ ]

2396.339 --> 2399.839
I mean seriously

2407.8 --> 2412.48
okay yeah I I do actually have four of

2411.28 --> 2414.19
those

2412.48 --> 2415.619
hahaha

2414.19 --> 2420.339
[Music]

2415.619 --> 2423.42
but I guarantee you I did not pay 700

2420.339 --> 2423.42
euros for them

2423.64 --> 2429.7
when the [ __ ] did they go up in price

2426.64 --> 2432.94
that much I think I paid like

2429.7 --> 2437.2799999999997
maybe 20 euros or something

2432.94 --> 2437.28
or less this is insane

2444.9 --> 2451.32
bro I better be careful with those

2448.66 --> 2451.3199999999997
[ __ ]

2456.88 --> 2461.7400000000002
stick them straight no [ __ ] you I have a

2459.94 --> 2464.2000000000003
place here where I could sell them but I

2461.74 --> 2467.3199999999997
don't want to sell them

2464.2 --> 2470.3799999999997
this is crazy but it is well

2467.32 --> 2473.619
yeah I mean if things get in an extreme

2470.38 --> 2477.4
emergency suddenly

2473.619 --> 2479.8
I have an option now good question yeah

2477.4 --> 2481.42
yeah well I'm not that desperate to like

2479.8 --> 2484.48
Oz

2481.42 --> 2488.28
I must sell everything

2484.48 --> 2488.28
but it's a nice discovery

2493.3 --> 2500.76
soon before Wizards run magic of dude

2496.14 --> 2500.7599999999998
the magic has been off the cliff

2502.9 --> 2506.1600000000003
for like a decade

2509.859 --> 2514.96
what is there any sign that they're that

2512.02 --> 2516.099
they're gonna like implode or whatever I

2514.96 --> 2518.8
don't think so I just think they're

2516.099 --> 2521.099
really just gonna keep it going they're

2518.8 --> 2521.099
going

2521.619 --> 2525.7200000000003
I did I had no idea dude

2533.079 --> 2539.46
it's absolutely insane when did it

2536.02 --> 2539.46
become that expensive man

2543.82 --> 2549.46
is there like a

2546.16 --> 2551.5
a chart of the price over the time

2549.46 --> 2553.48
somewhere

2551.5 --> 2554.98
I'd like to see that I want to see when

2553.48 --> 2557.64
the hell that became so freaking

2554.98 --> 2557.64
expensive

2559.26 --> 2566.5200000000004
oh oh and by the way yeah those cards

2562.9 --> 2566.52
are absolutely mint

2567.42 --> 2573.9
absolutely mint just for the for the

2569.859 --> 2573.9
record so that's that's cool

2582.76 --> 2588.94
that's not crypto ozee's collector cards

2586.18 --> 2591.5789999999997
I just don't understand how they became

2588.94 --> 2593.819
so insanely expensive and when that

2591.579 --> 2593.819
happened

2599.859 --> 2604.9
what a crazy Discovery talking about

2602.319 --> 2609.43
digging up gems I mean

2604.9 --> 2609.4300000000003
[Laughter]

2614.579 --> 2621.9
but I want to see like when when it

2617.98 --> 2621.9
becomes it looks freaking expensive man

2636.88 --> 2639.88
whoa

2643.319 --> 2648.04
holy [ __ ]

2645.64 --> 2650.319
it

2648.04 --> 2655.66
man

2650.319 --> 2658.14
so it it in 2021 it became [ __ ]

2655.66 --> 2658.14
insane

2658.72 --> 2663.339
yeah because I

2660.94 --> 2665.619
no no way

2663.339 --> 2668.7599999999998
yeah yeah man

2665.619 --> 2673.2000000000003
I bought it for like 30 each

2668.76 --> 2677.94
Jesus Christ that became expensive

2673.2 --> 2677.9399999999996
Jesus that's crazy

2685.06 --> 2689.68
I mean

2686.859 --> 2692.22
like seven years ago it was still 30

2689.68 --> 2692.22
Euros

2734.26 --> 2737.3390000000004
I did not expect

2738.46 --> 2743.8
but it's funny it's F I had I thought at

2742.24 --> 2747.839
the time that I was selling this [ __ ]

3180.3 --> 3186.6600000000003
oh yeah this one these might be this

3184.02 --> 3188.52
entire deck is really it was expensive

3186.66 --> 3192.68
it might even have decreased in price

3188.52 --> 3192.68
it's my artifact deck

3193.74 --> 3199.9199999999996

oh

3218.88 --> 3221.88
well

3222.599 --> 3232.079
that that one definitely grew in price

3228.839 --> 3234.839
like nine times I bought these for like

3232.079 --> 3237.599
five euros and they're 45 now

3234.839 --> 3240.72
but I'm never doing them away because

3237.599 --> 3244.1600000000003
they're absolutely core to this deck

3240.72 --> 3244.16
absolutely core

3244.559 --> 3248.6400000000003
I'm not doing not doing anything away

3246.42 --> 3251.0
from this deck because I invented this

3248.64 --> 3251.0
deck

3251.28 --> 3255.059
single tanker

3256.68 --> 3259.52
is worth

3264.54 --> 3267.079
hmm

3270.24 --> 3275.0
let's see what a howling mine is worth

3272.52 --> 3275.0
these days

3287.16 --> 3290.16
huh

3292.5 --> 3300.45
they've been more expensive in the past

3296.819 --> 3303.6
I might not fault what about that one

3300.45 --> 3303.6
[Applause]

3304.68 --> 3308.16
all right

3305.94 --> 3312.319
whoa

3308.16 --> 3312.319
whoa Jesus [ __ ] Christ

3313.52 --> 3319.02
holy [ __ ]

3316.38 --> 3322.079
man that yeah I mean

3319.02 --> 3323.48
there's a manifold from like the oldest

3322.079 --> 3329.3390000000004
one

3323.48 --> 3331.559
4 000 Euros [ __ ] dude the [ __ ] is that

3329.339 --> 3334.2599999999998
that's insane

3331.559 --> 3336.3
four thousand but it's still pretty

3334.26 --> 3338.28
expensive I mean I bought these

3336.3 --> 3340.2000000000003
originally for like

3338.28 --> 3344.46
10 euros I think and I think they're

3340.2 --> 3345.95
around like 50 now so that's not bad not

3344.46 --> 3347.78
doing them away though

3345.95 --> 3350.5789999999997
[Music]

3347.78 --> 3353.4
absolutely not

3350.579 --> 3355.319
let's see what a deserted Temple

3353.4 --> 3358.04
land

3355.319 --> 3358.04
is

3367.5 --> 3371.819
six

3369.96 --> 3374.0
I think I bought them for like 10 or

3371.819 --> 3374.0
something

3378.319 --> 3385.7
it's probably worth [ __ ]

3381.359 --> 3385.7
but it works really well on this deck

3404.94 --> 3409.28
yeah yeah it's worst [ __ ]

3409.68 --> 3413.24
no more prosperity

3421.52 --> 3427.339
that's not what [ __ ] either

3424.319 --> 3427.339
okay let's see

3428.22 --> 3431.359
full Thai key

3432.0 --> 3438.079
I that one was already getting expensive

3434.88 --> 3441.42
back then they were like okay we won one

3438.079 --> 3442.6800000000003
you have four

3441.42 --> 3445.2000000000003
oh

3442.68 --> 3447.359
wait what no wait I mixed it up with

3445.2 --> 3449.7599999999998
another one but it's still like six

3447.359 --> 3451.02
bucks I think they're still pretty rare

3449.76 --> 3452.8190000000004
though because they're so freaking

3451.02 --> 3456.54
amazing

3452.819 --> 3460.5099999999998
just untap an artifact really cheap

3456.54 --> 3463.639
uh let's see oh yeah talarian Academy

3460.51 --> 3463.639
[Music]

3465.3 --> 3468.3
foreign

3470.45 --> 3473.5
[Music]

3478.52 --> 3482.7
128 bucks

3480.839 --> 3484.98
dude

3482.7 --> 3487.5789999999997
I got them for like five euros

3484.98 --> 3487.579
originally

3487.819 --> 3492.3
I got four of them

3490.14 --> 3494.5789999999997
all right never doing that away because

3492.3 --> 3498.059
that's absolutely key to this deck I

3494.579 --> 3500.04
mean like yeah I might have just

3498.059 --> 3502.26
as well just sell the whole thing

3500.04 --> 3505.819
otherwise

3502.26 --> 3505.8190000000004
but it's really hilarious

3507.96 --> 3511.099
I wonder what like it

3509.56 --> 3513.119
[Music]

3511.099 --> 3516.619
soul ring

3513.119 --> 3521.839
from the old ones

3516.619 --> 3521.839
that one was already kind of expensive

3521.94 --> 3524.9
let's see what is now

3526.26 --> 3530.6400000000003
oh

3528.059 --> 3533.3390000000004
that one

3530.64 --> 3535.5
somewhere expensive but not so much like

3533.339 --> 3536.64
30 Euros right okay so it's pretty much

3535.5 --> 3539.48
the same

3536.64 --> 3539.48
I guess

3540.54 --> 3544.7
holy [ __ ] man that's a learning academy

3549.119 --> 3555.059
okay let's see what a juggernaut is

3552.48 --> 3557.4
worth I'm sorry guys this is maybe

3555.059 --> 3562.0400000000004
really a bit boring to you guys but I'm

3557.4 --> 3562.04
having fun here I'm gonna do it anyway

3563.54 --> 3569.48
juggernaut

3565.44 --> 3569.48
I'm the Juggernaut [ __ ]

3570.54 --> 3575.24
wow well that's worth all [ __ ]

3576.02 --> 3579.02
thank you

3580.799 --> 3586.799
those used to be like

3583.26 --> 3588.8390000000004
pretty expensive in the day I guess they

3586.799 --> 3591.299
suck now

3588.839 --> 3592.68
man that mocks that that's [ __ ]

3591.299 --> 3594.78
insane dude

3592.68 --> 3597.74
that is just

3594.78 --> 3597.7400000000002
nuts

3600.599 --> 3607.02
cool well I'm glad I didn't sell those

3604.14 --> 3613.2599999999998
cards the last time huh

3607.02 --> 3613.2599999999998
could have for like 10 euros 20.

3638.099 --> 3644.579
right yes metal slugs Mass it's also

3640.859 --> 3646.5
been certain Concepts it's like a new

3644.579 --> 3648.96
way to build the deck certainly gets

3646.5 --> 3650.88
really popular especially like in the

3648.96 --> 3652.38
actual competitions which still are

3650.88 --> 3655.26
going I think

3652.38 --> 3657.559
and then that's how that mocks so I

3655.26 --> 3662.1800000000003
guess that as somebody said before like

3657.559 --> 3662.1800000000003
did you invent the gravedigger

3664.22 --> 3669.54
gravedigger that concept and I can say

3666.839 --> 3675.599
yes yes I did

3669.54 --> 3676.619
I actually did in like 97 98 in that

3675.599 --> 3680.04
time

3676.619 --> 3682.319
I just were I wasn't like Oh I'm a magic

3680.04 --> 3684.5
player I didn't do any competition I was

3682.319 --> 3687.839
just gaming with some guys

3684.5 --> 3690.78
sometimes went to some uh

3687.839 --> 3694.68
we call that like a fair whereas like

3690.78 --> 3696.8390000000004
magic collector's Fair a couple of times

3694.68 --> 3699.5989999999997
and I did show my deck even back then

3696.839 --> 3702.839
but nobody had heard of it I didn't even

3699.599 --> 3706.079
so it's like now apparently it's like

3702.839 --> 3709.38
all the [ __ ] well guess

3706.079 --> 3712.1400000000003
what the MOX diamond in which deck it is

3709.38 --> 3714.96
yeah it's in that deck

3712.14 --> 3718.799
I got them like

3714.96 --> 3721.46
over 10 years ago as a supplement for

3718.799 --> 3721.46
that deck

3721.52 --> 3726.78
and I guess that deck is very popular

3724.98 --> 3729.0
now

3726.78 --> 3731.88
that format and they probably use even

3729.0 --> 3733.68
other monsters and all that more insane

3731.88 --> 3735.9
modern [ __ ]

3733.68 --> 3738.0589999999997
so like kill him instantly in the first

3735.9 --> 3740.7000000000003
turn I mean that

3738.059 --> 3742.6800000000003
didn't even used to exist really kill

3740.7 --> 3745.859
him in the first turn that was like a

3742.68 --> 3747.66
super rare Combi

3745.859 --> 3750.0589999999997
where you basically have to have the

3747.66 --> 3752.3999999999996
perfect first hand and then you do that

3750.059 --> 3754.3190000000004
but now it's become easier and all that

3752.4 --> 3757.26
it's shitty I mean imagine Modern Magic

3754.319 --> 3759.96
has gone [ __ ] but yeah I guess somebody

3757.26 --> 3764.28
caught on to my Gravedigger concept some

3759.96 --> 3764.28
time ago and kaboom

3765.24 --> 3768.7799999999997
price went up

3767.099 --> 3771.98
like

3768.78 --> 3771.98
twelve hundred percent

3772.98 --> 3778.099
huh

3774.42 --> 3778.099
no I'm not gonna no

3778.319 --> 3784.04
no steamy traveler no

3781.559 --> 3784.0400000000004
sorry

3789.72 --> 3797.0989999999997
I invented certain card configurations

3792.38 --> 3799.799
that's correct I was really into Magic

3797.099 --> 3802.4
played it at school all the time

3799.799 --> 3805.22
even during class

3802.4 --> 3808.88
I would skip class to keep playing Magic

3805.22 --> 3808.8799999999997
with the guys there

3836.88 --> 3842.4
you know what the funny thing would be

3840.599 --> 3845.2400000000002
funniest thing is that I could

3842.4 --> 3845.2400000000002
technically just

3847.02 --> 3852.059
sell them

3848.94 --> 3855.359
and buy back my old cards

3852.059 --> 3857.94
like gauntlets

3855.359 --> 3862.819
of Might let's see what that thing is

3857.94 --> 3862.819
worth right now Jesus [ __ ] hell

3862.92 --> 3865.04
no

3865.099 --> 3872.1800000000003

3881.88 --> 3888.3
I feel really shitty now

3885.15 --> 3888.3
[Applause]

3889.14 --> 3894.98
man

3891.54 --> 3894.98
whoever would see that coming

3903.359 --> 3909.0
at least I didn't make a loss on them

3905.339 --> 3911.4
when I saw them but still [ __ ]

3909.0 --> 3913.74
I want him back

3911.4 --> 3916.5

3916.5 --> 3922.38
GoFundMe for four gauntlets of might I

3918.839 --> 3925.0789999999997
mean it only costs like 5 000 Euros

3922.38 --> 3927.54
you guys would pay for that right

3925.079 --> 3928.7400000000002
that's important

3927.54 --> 3932.04
right

3928.74 --> 3934.319
get our win four gauntlets of my car to

3932.04 --> 3937.619

he doesn't actually play Magic

3937.619 --> 3940.4
right guys

3951.24 --> 3956.5789999999997
yeah no you know what in the face of all

3954.66 --> 3959.48
that I think I'm gonna hold on to the

3956.579 --> 3959.48
[ __ ] mocks

3960.48 --> 3965.88
because I don't know man this is a

3963.599 --> 3968.04
stupid thing to say in general but like

3965.88 --> 3969.48
yeah in five years they may be double

3968.04 --> 3972.0
that

3969.48 --> 3976.94
or they may be worth absolutely [ __ ]

3972.0 --> 3976.94
because it's no longer cool or whatever

3977.22 --> 3981.66
that's like all the newest update makes

3979.619 --> 3985.92
it completely useless and then it's

3981.66 --> 3987.68
worth nothing again well whatever

3985.92 --> 3990.599
foreign

3987.68 --> 3992.819
just feeling sorry I sold those guns of

3990.599 --> 3995.88

4039.98 --> 4045.16
think for the cards and yeah

4041.78 --> 4045.1600000000003
that's that's a good point

4047.059 --> 4052.6400000000003
I mean seriously there is going to be an

4050.0 --> 4053.96
effect here it's already happened in

4052.64 --> 4056.0589999999997
several fields

4053.96 --> 4058.7
and that is that retro is going to be

4056.059 --> 4062.3590000000004
more and more popular it's gonna

4058.7 --> 4065.299
grow in value because why because the

4062.359 --> 4068.839
newer games will just start to suck more

4065.299 --> 4072.319
and more become Dumber less fulfilling

4068.839 --> 4074.96
all games all of it and so people will

4072.319 --> 4076.64
want like we want that old game yeah

4074.96 --> 4078.619
there was less

4076.64 --> 4081.14
but if there was something magic to it

4078.619 --> 4084.02
there was something real to it

4081.14 --> 4086.5989999999997
so yeah there's a good chance that old

4084.02 --> 4088.52
games like I really love Baldur's Gate

4086.599 --> 4090.619
yeah it's a very it's over 20 years old

4088.52 --> 4093.64
you know

4090.619 --> 4093.6400000000003
I love it

4094.039 --> 4101.06
I think it is like better than the new

4097.46 --> 4102.859
[ __ ] that comes out I really do

4101.06 --> 4104.779
I'm not gonna be the only one in the

4102.859 --> 4106.400000000001
future that thinks like that

4104.779 --> 4108.620000000001
so

4106.4 --> 4110.179
because the new or developed things are

4108.62 --> 4113.12
also pushed and

4110.179 --> 4117.5
pushed and forced and like done by

4113.12 --> 4119.0599999999995
enslaved people with deranged Minds

4117.5 --> 4122.719
a lot of it

4119.06 --> 4124.46
or too eager to just catch that crowd

4122.719 --> 4127.16
and so they're going to be appealing to

4124.46 --> 4128.96
retards who quickly click they so it's

4127.16 --> 4130.94
all going to be [ __ ] in the future you

4128.96 --> 4133.64
see that's the corporatization it's all

4130.94 --> 4136.879999999999
going to be [ __ ] [ __ ] product [ __ ] feed

4133.64 --> 4139.64
to just like quickly grab the attention

4136.88 --> 4142.42
of a [ __ ] so they'll pay some money

4139.64 --> 4142.42
and then

4142.58 --> 4146.0599999999995
forget about it

4144.44 --> 4149.12
that's what it's going to be aimed at

4146.06 --> 4150.859
more and more because yeah it does work

4149.12 --> 4152.7789999999995
it's just trick a [ __ ] to pay you

4150.859 --> 4155.120000000001
money

4152.779 --> 4157.779
that's what's going to be aimed at

4155.12 --> 4161.7789999999995
right so there's not going to be great

4157.779 --> 4161.779
revolutionary inspiring

4162.44 --> 4170.178999999999
like even contemporarily relevant

4165.52 --> 4172.299000000001
products then anymore you see

4170.179 --> 4175.1
because there's no more like

4172.299 --> 4176.9
corporations don't care about your

4175.1 --> 4179.660000000001
culture about your spirit about your

4176.9 --> 4182.9
development they just want you to take

4179.66 --> 4185.299
debate like a [ __ ] they want your

4182.9 --> 4186.8589999999995
money they don't care that you become

4185.299 --> 4190.94
more deranged

4186.859 --> 4192.92
they just want you to in that very

4190.94 --> 4194.54
moment think that you're cool with it

4192.92 --> 4196.9400000000005
and then you like it

4194.54 --> 4199.46
and you pay for it that's all they care

4196.94 --> 4202.04
about most of these Mega corporations

4199.46 --> 4206.26
even gaming industry movie industry

4202.04 --> 4206.26
that's all they care about a lot of them

4206.6 --> 4212.26
foreign

4209.0 --> 4212.26
it's going to get worse

4212.48 --> 4216.379999999999
because there's going to be more [ __ ]

4214.34 --> 4218.54
so there's going to be more appeal for

4216.38 --> 4220.88
them to make money and then do that

4218.54 --> 4224.12
making their more [ __ ] so they're

4220.88 --> 4226.82
literally breeding retards

4224.12 --> 4229.4
because that's easy feed

4226.82 --> 4231.08
for the mecca corporations

4229.4 --> 4232.219
though everybody's good that's going to

4231.08 --> 4235.219
be designing is going to be making

4232.219 --> 4236.42
[ __ ] products to appeal to the retards

4235.219 --> 4239.6
which are increasing in numbers

4236.42 --> 4242.659
including because of your products

4239.6 --> 4244.820000000001
and guarantee a feeding bottom

4242.659 --> 4247.879999999999
all you have to do is Trick a [ __ ]

4244.82 --> 4249.44
they'll give you money and then you you

4247.88 --> 4251.3
succeed with your corporations because

4249.44 --> 4253.219
there's a lot of retards and so there

4251.3 --> 4254.96
will be a lot of retards you can trick

4253.219 --> 4257.32
into giving you money with a stupid

4254.96 --> 4257.32
product

4264.02 --> 4269.780000000001
it's a degeneration cycle it's it's

4266.9 --> 4273.679
gonna be idiocracy partially because of

4269.78 --> 4275.42
that media influence right it's gaming

4273.679 --> 4279.8
media

4275.42 --> 4283.82
movies series it's all just

4279.8 --> 4287.06
getting more noisy more superficial

4283.82 --> 4289.82
more flashy more extreme

4287.06 --> 4293.26
Dumber

4289.82 --> 4293.259999999999
more attention grabby

4293.42 --> 4299.96
less inclined to make you feel stupid

4297.62 --> 4303.08
and it's all gonna be garbage and then

4299.96 --> 4304.699
anyone that's not just a [ __ ] that's

4303.08 --> 4306.86
about to get themselves killed because

4304.699 --> 4309.08
of their own stupidity they will then

4306.86 --> 4311.239
eventually like it will just

4309.08 --> 4312.8
they will see it it's like this is all

4311.239 --> 4315.139999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4312.8 --> 4317.719
I don't wanna I don't enjoy this anymore

4315.14 --> 4318.62
I want something more personal something

4317.719 --> 4320.06
more

4318.62 --> 4321.92
real

4320.06 --> 4324.14
and they're gonna look back to all their

4321.92 --> 4326.659
stuff and then see hey those actually

4324.14 --> 4328.6990000000005
had a spirit they get the designers

4326.659 --> 4330.92
actually imbued this game with a spirit

4328.699 --> 4332.12
and a soul what is this

4330.92 --> 4335.62
right

4332.12 --> 4335.62
and then that's gonna continue

4336.62 --> 4342.739
more people who eventually wean off the

4339.8 --> 4344.54
ever-growing retardation

4342.739 --> 4347.0199999999995
from corporations and then they will

4344.54 --> 4347.0199999999995
fizzle

4352.4 --> 4355.599999999999
now we'll go bust

4356.54 --> 4361.34
I might get bought up by Disney I mean I

4359.78 --> 4363.199
think that Disney's probably going to

4361.34 --> 4364.400000000001
end up just buying everything that's

4363.199 --> 4368.36
failing

4364.4 --> 4373.299999999999
just become the mega Corporation

4368.36 --> 4373.299999999999
like Mom carp in Futurama

4381.62 --> 4389.5599999999995
there's a market for him written letters

4384.52 --> 4389.56
this is okay that's weird

4391.4 --> 4395.12
laughs

4393.02 --> 4397.820000000001
you know that I can actually do

4395.12 --> 4399.8
handwriting

4397.82 --> 4402.62
I haven't really done it in a long time

4399.8 --> 4405.1990000000005
but I can I was very good at it even I

4402.62 --> 4406.88
have a very good handwriting it's just

4405.199 --> 4409.879999999999
that for notes I always use block

4406.88 --> 4413.6
letters and that gets a bit messy

4409.88 --> 4416.96
sometimes especially when I'm in a hurry

4413.6 --> 4419.110000000001
when I am an eloquent writer

4416.96 --> 4422.27
very fluid

4419.11 --> 4422.2699999999995
[Music]

4438.5 --> 4445.06
all right anyway that was that was a

4440.659 --> 4445.0599999999995
funny unexpected Discovery today

4459.5 --> 4462.5
man

4475.54 --> 4480.46
I am a bit bummed out though about the

4478.04 --> 4485.0199999999995
guns of Mike

4480.46 --> 4485.02
but I mean I really needed the money

4486.199 --> 4488.98
I think

4493.58 --> 4497.5599999999995
don't even remember what it was for

4499.46 --> 4502.4
I was doing really bad in that time

4501.38 --> 4506.02
anyway

4502.4 --> 4506.0199999999995
but anyway right uh

4506.719 --> 4514.6
metal detector whoever used it

4511.0 --> 4514.6
uh no

4534.04 --> 4537.1
[Music]

4564.89 --> 4568.149
[Music]

4572.659 --> 4574.839999999999
foreign

4581.86 --> 4586.699
like I gotta have some land to actually

4584.42 --> 4590.8
scan with that [ __ ] but

4586.699 --> 4590.799999999999
I get your point I mean yeah it's fun

4591.679 --> 4596.78
although I'm personally more like I like

4594.26 --> 4599.179
digging in a wall and then

4596.78 --> 4601.219
bumping into crystals and [ __ ] that's

4599.179 --> 4604.54
what I really like

4601.219 --> 4604.54
well that's treasure hunting

4616.58 --> 4624.219
why did I buy my raw materials from uh

4620.239 --> 4624.218999999999
from this big organization

4624.26 --> 4629.659000000001
it's like this

4626.36 --> 4633.5
big company that's International

4629.659 --> 4636.32
and they have like yeah

4633.5 --> 4639.04
they make blade materials in detail and

4636.32 --> 4639.04
yeah

4639.32 --> 4644.96
have like all equipment you could ever

4642.5 --> 4647.739
imagine pretty much involving

4644.96 --> 4647.7390000000005
goldsmithing

4650.06 --> 4654.860000000001
right it's a company called drive out

4652.699 --> 4657.58
but I think they might have like changed

4654.86 --> 4657.58
their name or something

4658.4 --> 4662.5
but that's where I got most my materials

4660.26 --> 4662.5
from

4690.14 --> 4693.14
okay

4694.0 --> 4697.06
all right

4703.82 --> 4708.799999999999
I mean there's other places where you

4705.8 --> 4712.52
can also get materials I've just kind of

4708.8 --> 4714.62
I liked that place more

4712.52 --> 4717.679
although it is a place that you can

4714.62 --> 4720.38
really only reach if you have a car so I

4717.679 --> 4723.28
haven't been there in a while

4720.38 --> 4723.28
you know what I mean

4723.98 --> 4728.0599999999995
I mean you could probably technically

4726.26 --> 4731.62
get there with the bus but that would be

4728.06 --> 4731.620000000001
like a very long trip

4745.179 --> 4750.58
okay chaos

4747.62 --> 4750.58
good for you

4752.36 --> 4756.62
aren't part of working with gold do I

4754.76 --> 4758.96
miss the most well technically I haven't

4756.62 --> 4761.239
even worked that much with gold the

4758.96 --> 4764.0
material gold itself

4761.239 --> 4766.159
I mean I made some things for sure but

4764.0 --> 4768.699
not that many mostly which is working

4766.159 --> 4768.699
with silver

4769.159 --> 4772.299999999999
what do I miss

4782.26 --> 4788.8
I like the creative inspiration I like

4785.96 --> 4788.8
yeah

4790.699 --> 4792.94
foreign

4795.739 --> 4799.4
I mean I had a lot of creative

4797.659 --> 4801.379999999999
inspiration even I've called the stuff

4799.4 --> 4805.299999999999
and all that which I definitely did also

4801.38 --> 4805.3
draw into it for myself

4807.08 --> 4813.4
it is very interesting thing occupation

4810.8 --> 4813.400000000001
to do

4814.76 --> 4820.64
I yeah so I do like it but only when I

4818.06 --> 4822.080000000001
can actually do it on my own time with

4820.64 --> 4824.2390000000005
my own speed

4822.08 --> 4826.96
and make something that is actually

4824.239 --> 4826.959999999999
interesting

4827.84 --> 4834.38
and not like just some cookie cutter

4831.56 --> 4836.3
conveyor belt style setup

4834.38 --> 4838.28
where it's just Mass producing something

4836.3 --> 4841.04
or whatever right that that would get

4838.28 --> 4844.639999999999
very tedious to me just like any

4841.04 --> 4846.56
conveyor belt type work

4844.64 --> 4850.219
but that's not what I was doing I was

4846.56 --> 4853.219
just like making creative projects and

4850.219 --> 4855.86
then customer had an idea

4853.219 --> 4857.6
I basically try to design something on

4855.86 --> 4859.219
the spot for them

4857.6 --> 4862.34
the idea

4859.219 --> 4864.26
and see if they like it and really like

4862.34 --> 4867.9800000000005
they need to like it they need to be

4864.26 --> 4870.46
like oh that's exactly what I hoped

4867.98 --> 4870.459999999999
right

4870.98 --> 4875.78
and then making it and they have them

4873.62 --> 4877.699
being very satisfied with it and me

4875.78 --> 4879.5
basically also being relatively cheap

4877.699 --> 4883.219
because I did

4879.5 --> 4885.679
I wanted people that weren't just rich

4883.219 --> 4887.96
also to have really meaningful beautiful

4885.679 --> 4890.5
jewels that they would like really

4887.96 --> 4890.5
cherish

4890.659 --> 4895.599999999999
that's what I wanted to do and I did

4892.699 --> 4895.599999999999
that successfully

4898.12 --> 4903.44
what's the favorite piece I made

4901.1 --> 4907.46
uh

4903.44 --> 4910.219
well I mean my gold ring

4907.46 --> 4912.02
and yeah just for the record this is the

4910.219 --> 4914.7390000000005
first gold object that I've ever

4912.02 --> 4914.7390000000005
actually made

4915.38 --> 4921.92
it went really successful

4918.739 --> 4924.099999999999
so yeah in that sense it's definitely my

4921.92 --> 4924.1
favorite

4947.239 --> 4951.54
foreign

4948.41 --> 4951.54
[Music]

4979.659 --> 4987.58
Benjamin also mentioned that he saw the

4983.12 --> 4987.58
northern lights in the U.S as well

4992.49 --> 4998.32
[Music]

4994.34 --> 4998.32
what a bunch and nonsense

4999.199 --> 5004.719
what a bunch of nonsense is that steamy

5002.86 --> 5007.0199999999995
traveler where did you pick up on that

5004.719 --> 5007.02
[ __ ]

5014.32 --> 5018.299999999999
just

5015.64 --> 5018.3
foreign

5025.48 --> 5028.799999999999
can't be serious

5049.6 --> 5053.08
like what the [ __ ] are they gonna do

5051.34 --> 5055.54
with that

5053.08 --> 5058.0
turn back time and make Hillary Clinton

5055.54 --> 5061.92
win that presidency again or something

5058.0 --> 5061.92
like what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ]

5063.82 --> 5066.82
like

5064.9 --> 5068.679
who cares even

5066.82 --> 5071.34
it's not possible it's absolutely

5068.679 --> 5071.34
[ __ ]

5083.44 --> 5085.98
oh

5090.46 --> 5094.4800000000005
but anyway yeah thanks for bringing that

5092.92 --> 5097.12
up steamy traveler it sounds like

5094.48 --> 5101.159
absolute horse [ __ ] like oh we're time

5097.12 --> 5101.159
Lords now oh quantum

5101.32 --> 5105.48
give me a break please

5137.32 --> 5142.08
anyway I hope you guys are still

5139.36 --> 5142.08
enjoying the show

5143.679 --> 5147.12
I'm gonna just keep going

5148.12 --> 5152.46
cause Nathan isn't doing a live stream

5152.8 --> 5155.76
because he's sick

5175.84 --> 5179.9800000000005
no

5177.76 --> 5182.76
see me traveler what the [ __ ] is the

5179.98 --> 5182.759999999999
point of all that

5186.28 --> 5194.46
why would I want to go anywhere

5190.12 --> 5194.46
do I need to escape from this life

5209.32 --> 5215.139
no no look steamy traveler I imagine

5213.04 --> 5217.179
that if there was something like that

5215.139 --> 5220.179
possible and I might have even emulated

5217.179 --> 5222.639
it in the dark world and going back to

5220.179 --> 5225.52
the past is pointless because you've

5222.639 --> 5230.56
outgrown it and your memories of it are

5225.52 --> 5232.780000000001
more fun than the actual experience okay

5230.56 --> 5234.820000000001
and the future is going to be way too

5232.78 --> 5238.719
intense and you will not be able to

5234.82 --> 5238.719
handle it yet

5238.78 --> 5244.42
which was part of my personal Journey

5242.139 --> 5246.34
throughout time problem

5244.42 --> 5248.4400000000005
that when I was seeing things and

5246.34 --> 5250.4800000000005
experiencing them I could not handle it

5248.44 --> 5253.799999999999
with what I was back then

5250.48 --> 5253.799999999999
going to 17.

5254.32 --> 5259.54
so there's absolutely no point in time

5256.9 --> 5260.92
travel for our Spirits you go back to

5259.54 --> 5263.139
the past

5260.92 --> 5265.36
things are not as

5263.139 --> 5267.58
awesome as you remember them it will

5265.36 --> 5270.759999999999
actually ruin your love for things if

5267.58 --> 5272.5599999999995
you do that we go to the Future oh you

5270.76 --> 5273.34
might get to know where it's going yeah

5272.56 --> 5275.02
but

5273.34 --> 5276.9400000000005
you're going to be faced with a lot of

5275.02 --> 5280.080000000001
really Grim things and things that you

5276.94 --> 5280.08
don't want to have happened

5281.32 --> 5284.32
like

5287.94 --> 5292.0599999999995
for example if there's somebody you

5290.38 --> 5295.62
really love and respect and in the

5292.06 --> 5295.620000000001
future Dave died somewhere

5296.739 --> 5301.0
that will if you then go back or

5299.38 --> 5302.32
whatever it would totally [ __ ]

5301.0 --> 5306.04
everything up

5302.32 --> 5310.0599999999995
it would ruin the energy would ruin the

5306.04 --> 5314.5199999999995
actual Joy of them being around

5310.06 --> 5314.52
knowing the future ruins everything

5315.82 --> 5319.739
for the one that's experiencing it

5326.92 --> 5333.4
if time space expands with time is the

5331.12 --> 5335.5599999999995
future what

5333.4 --> 5337.32
no it's just a bunch of blabbering

5335.56 --> 5341.620000000001
nonsense

5337.32 --> 5344.159
space expands in time a bunch of

5341.62 --> 5344.159
[ __ ]

5344.26 --> 5350.639
yeah the universe might expand whatever

5346.78 --> 5350.639
it's not gonna change anything

5360.04 --> 5368.38
tiny fast do you thinking just when you

5364.239 --> 5370.959999999999
get exposed to astronomical thinking you

5368.38 --> 5373.179
become [ __ ]

5370.96 --> 5377.26
then suddenly everything is small and

5373.179 --> 5381.42
it's just so stupid so [ __ ] pointless

5377.26 --> 5381.42
to think about those things really

5396.639 --> 5404.02
to the dawn of mankind what and be a

5400.3 --> 5406.06
mutated [ __ ] from the future

5404.02 --> 5407.8
that would be seen as a sniveling

5406.06 --> 5411.06
monster

5407.8 --> 5411.06
would you do that Oz

5413.5 --> 5418.32
how long you think you'd survive there

5420.1 --> 5423.3
among giants

5429.89 --> 5433.129
[Music]

5449.639 --> 5455.1990000000005
Giants yes Giants

5452.56 --> 5457.3
humans were bigger in the past and are

5455.199 --> 5459.159
going to be smaller in the future so if

5457.3 --> 5461.139
you're gonna go to the far past you're

5459.159 --> 5462.48
gonna seem like a sniveling little

5461.139 --> 5466.6
[ __ ]

5462.48 --> 5468.879999999999
mutant that's a [ __ ] and doesn't have

5466.6 --> 5471.400000000001
their normal spiritual faculties I mean

5468.88 --> 5474.179
you can't even standard telepathy

5471.4 --> 5477.638999999999
communicate what kind of a useless

5474.179 --> 5480.04
mutant worm are you right or if you go

5477.639 --> 5482.9800000000005
into the far future then you will be

5480.04 --> 5484.239
like a God because everybody's shriveled

5482.98 --> 5486.099999999999
mutated

5484.239 --> 5490.259999999999
ugly

5486.1 --> 5490.26
tiny Beyond Grappler

5491.739 --> 5496.44
and you're gonna be really out of place

5494.08 --> 5496.44
there

5499.3 --> 5503.860000000001
this is only rough modeling by the way I

5501.58 --> 5506.0199999999995
mean don't know I don't know if there

5503.86 --> 5508.48
would be a far future if that's physical

5506.02 --> 5510.46
if like if through the physical

5508.48 --> 5511.659
continuation of what's here if that

5510.46 --> 5514.179
would exist

5511.659 --> 5517.92
or if the entire place would transform

5514.179 --> 5517.92
at some point I don't know

5524.679 --> 5529.86
the test is past is Tiny no it isn't

5535.6 --> 5542.280000000001
it that's wrong

5538.659 --> 5545.379999999999
people were much larger in the far past

5542.28 --> 5547.78
yeah they might have not had

5545.38 --> 5550.06
great nutrition at times which would

5547.78 --> 5552.46
stunt their growth

5550.06 --> 5554.6990000000005
right entire peoples would have stunted

5552.46 --> 5558.1
growth because of malnutrition and

5554.699 --> 5563.219
slavery and all that [ __ ]

5558.1 --> 5563.219
but if they'd got the same kind of food

5563.44 --> 5570.759999999999
energy yeah well challenges but mostly

5567.34 --> 5574.7390000000005
food as we do now they would grow much

5570.76 --> 5574.7390000000005
bigger than we do now

5577.719 --> 5585.46
because humans were bigger

5582.159 --> 5590.5599999999995
it's a shrinking cycle

5585.46 --> 5593.679
started out like a Colossus potentially

5590.56 --> 5597.719
now from a Colossus to a giant and from

5593.679 --> 5597.719
a giant to large humans

5597.88 --> 5602.28
from large humans to medium-sized humans

5600.4 --> 5604.48
and from medium-sized humans to

5602.28 --> 5608.32
grappler-sized humans

5604.48 --> 5611.98
we're already getting there partially

5608.32 --> 5614.259999999999
yeah that's what's happening

5611.98 --> 5617.138999999999
very much smaller over time not the

5614.26 --> 5619.6
other way around that's a nonsense myth

5617.139 --> 5621.6990000000005
we're all growing taller no no that's

5619.6 --> 5624.360000000001
just a moment of luxury and suddenly you

5621.699 --> 5624.36
become bigger

5629.44 --> 5634.96
toxic influences May stunt growth right

5632.44 --> 5637.32
I mean in the far past there was not so

5634.96 --> 5639.88
much knowledge about toxic influences

5637.32 --> 5642.28
industries were rougher

5639.88 --> 5644.32
more toxic materials were used and would

5642.28 --> 5645.699
influence the overall condition of the

5644.32 --> 5649.48
people

5645.699 --> 5651.46
which would probably stunt their growth

5649.48 --> 5653.86
on a temporary level

5651.46 --> 5657.46
so if you would have given them

5653.86 --> 5658.719
a life like a really well taken care of

5657.46 --> 5662.139
nutritious

5658.719 --> 5664.199
wealthy life from now and while still

5662.139 --> 5667.12
occupation of doing things

5664.199 --> 5671.62
in their time not get depressed and

5667.12 --> 5675.599999999999
bored then they would grow bigger

5671.62 --> 5675.599999999999
bigger than we grow now

5684.04 --> 5688.85
when were humans bigger than now

5686.32 --> 5693.159
Biblical times

5688.85 --> 5695.679
[Music]

5693.159 --> 5698.199
you know

5695.679 --> 5699.9400000000005
people were pretty freaking big

5698.199 --> 5702.659
in biblical times

5699.94 --> 5702.659
larger

5704.139 --> 5708.159000000001
talking pre-christ I mean still during

5706.659 --> 5709.36
Christ I don't think they were really

5708.159 --> 5712.239
small

5709.36 --> 5713.86
except for Paul that is who was like a

5712.239 --> 5716.32
miniature grabbler

5713.86 --> 5720.04
figure

5716.32 --> 5723.719
but it was really an exception like that

5720.04 --> 5723.719
I think people were taller

5726.34 --> 5730.719
there's not a lot of mention about exact

5729.219 --> 5732.1
height is there

5730.719 --> 5734.139
thank you

5732.1 --> 5737.1990000000005
throughout stories except

5734.139 --> 5738.219
like concerning lineages of Noah and all

5737.199 --> 5741.04
that

5738.219 --> 5744.639
they have size registry

5741.04 --> 5747.82
with some of that in the Bible I think

5744.639 --> 5751.92
and they were large larger

5747.82 --> 5751.92
really large men

5754.179 --> 5758.9800000000005
and there's

5755.739 --> 5762.099999999999
and their word Giants as well

5758.98 --> 5765.0599999999995
still Giants are like really much larger

5762.1 --> 5765.06
humans

5769.36 --> 5776.32
right and arguably

5772.0 --> 5779.08
you could say that we are like

5776.32 --> 5782.199
The Offspring of the Giants in an

5779.08 --> 5784.48
indirect sense not like literally

5782.199 --> 5786.46
but that their distant cousins and they

5784.48 --> 5788.44
basically stayed large with all the

5786.46 --> 5790.719
issues that come with it because being

5788.44 --> 5793.54
really large in this world right now is

5790.719 --> 5796.3
more burdensome just like in the future

5793.54 --> 5800.139
being just your size

5796.3 --> 5801.58
is going to be more burdensome

5800.139 --> 5804.34
I mean

5801.58 --> 5806.679
who knows how crazy far this cycle could

5804.34 --> 5808.719
get I mean it could be like literally

5806.679 --> 5811.54
like you know a hundred thousand years

5808.719 --> 5813.4
if this place is still around

5811.54 --> 5815.44
that you're gonna go learn in some kind

5813.4 --> 5818.5599999999995
of time machine and that people would be

5815.44 --> 5821.138999999999
literally roganized they would be like

5818.56 --> 5823.6
10 centimeters tall

5821.139 --> 5824.56
and you would literally be a giant to

5823.6 --> 5826.42
them

5824.56 --> 5828.280000000001
but you could barely breathe because

5826.42 --> 5829.36
it's like

5828.28 --> 5831.4
it

5829.36 --> 5832.98
the world the way it's arranged

5831.4 --> 5836.879999999999
everything has become smaller

5832.98 --> 5836.879999999999
atmospheres become thinner

5837.159 --> 5840.0
somehow

5841.3 --> 5845.1990000000005
it's retracting

5843.28 --> 5847.54
because

5845.199 --> 5850.419999999999
it's just things don't reach up as far

5847.54 --> 5851.92
anymore so the gradients become even

5850.42 --> 5854.56
more pronounced

5851.92 --> 5856.6
and yeah I don't know I'm just kind of

5854.56 --> 5858.820000000001
free speculating here

5856.6 --> 5860.02
very free speculating I just really

5858.82 --> 5862.179
think that

5860.02 --> 5864.6990000000005
there's an entropy going on throughout

5862.179 --> 5866.62
history about sizes of humans and we all

5864.699 --> 5868.419999999999
become smaller over time I just believe

5866.62 --> 5871.179
that

5868.42 --> 5873.58
and some hold on to it

5871.179 --> 5875.139
but then the world becomes tougher on

5873.58 --> 5877.96
their lineage

5875.139 --> 5880.719
they stay large

5877.96 --> 5883.9
and that's partially what happened in my

5880.719 --> 5886.84
opinion to the giants that are still

5883.9 --> 5889.36
that were still remaining of old

5886.84 --> 5891.96
they couldn't handle being that large in

5889.36 --> 5891.96
this world anymore

5893.54 --> 5896.71
[Music]

5898.659 --> 5903.699
what the hell are you talking about Oz

5901.06 --> 5905.56
Apes I'm not talking about apes I'm

5903.699 --> 5908.44
talking about humans

5905.56 --> 5912.580000000001
not Apes

5908.44 --> 5913.9
humans are humans we don't evolve from

5912.58 --> 5918.9
other animals

5913.9 --> 5918.9
we were always human we were just bigger

5922.42 --> 5926.5
am I up to date with open yes yes I

5924.699 --> 5928.0
watched it I even watched yesterday's

5926.5 --> 5930.6
show

5928.0 --> 5930.6
LG

5931.12 --> 5936.219
watched all of it

5934.0 --> 5939.06
yeah he definitely cut off sources now

5936.219 --> 5939.06
with I mean

5940.179 --> 5947.32
Jim Bob's done

5943.48 --> 5949.48
is really freaking done and man I'm

5947.32 --> 5952.259999999999
shocked by all the things that Owen has

5949.48 --> 5952.259999999999
revealed about him

5960.84 --> 5968.400000000001
are humans much less intelligent

5964.48 --> 5968.4
than our giant ancestors

5974.92 --> 5977.88
I can't say

5981.42 --> 5988.5
like big being bigger doesn't I think

5984.639 --> 5988.5
make you automatically smarter

5989.5 --> 5995.679
right and your ability to be smart is

5993.4 --> 5998.32
often dependent on how well

5995.679 --> 6001.7390000000005
your bodily condition is

5998.32 --> 6003.78
so the Giants would have been

6001.739 --> 6005.339999999999
in their own age it would have been just

6003.78 --> 6008.219
perfectly fine yeah they would have been

6005.34 --> 6010.860000000001
more brilliant like at the start apps

6008.219 --> 6014.1
everything was way more brilliant

6010.86 --> 6015.9
but later when everything becomes more

6014.1 --> 6018.719
difficult yeah they would not be able to

6015.9 --> 6020.759999999999
they would be like burdened all the time

6018.719 --> 6022.38
by how the world is

6020.76 --> 6024.12
it's more tough so they probably

6022.38 --> 6026.6990000000005
wouldn't be as intelligent because they

6024.12 --> 6028.5599999999995
just couldn't focus anymore to that

6026.699 --> 6031.04
level because the conditions weren't

6028.56 --> 6031.04
good anymore

6032.3 --> 6035.84
that's what I think

6038.639 --> 6042.32
well here comes the ankle biters

6050.46 --> 6055.26
that was quick

6052.139 --> 6057.900000000001
is the status on Jim Bob's I don't know

6055.26 --> 6060.5
his status I just know he went full rage

6057.9 --> 6060.5
gametard

6061.8 --> 6065.400000000001
everything that I liked about him is all

6064.38 --> 6068.6990000000005
gone

6065.4 --> 6069.96
it's all gone there's nothing left that

6068.699 --> 6071.4
I can respect

6069.96 --> 6075.4800000000005
nothing

6071.4 --> 6079.62
he's literally turned into a Grappler

6075.48 --> 6081.959999999999
and when I faced him about it

6079.62 --> 6084.0599999999995
last time in the chat he threatened to

6081.96 --> 6086.699
ban me

6084.06 --> 6089.580000000001
she's never done before

6086.699 --> 6092.419999999999
so there's just nothing left

6089.58 --> 6092.42
it's all gone

6092.58 --> 6098.34
it's boring it's pointless

6095.46 --> 6100.86
it's all based on some stupid consensus

6098.34 --> 6104.1
yeah hermeneutics is just another

6100.86 --> 6106.94
consensus nonsense

6104.1 --> 6106.9400000000005
source

6113.159 --> 6117.619
it's like the globe but for religion

6117.86 --> 6122.299999999999
for their religion that's how I see it

6132.86 --> 6138.36
or qnv

6135.48 --> 6141.379999999999
I've been getting some trolls talking

6138.36 --> 6141.38
[ __ ] about you

6142.38 --> 6145.92
in

6143.82 --> 6148.159
the message yeah in comments that was

6145.92 --> 6148.159
weird

6156.88 --> 6161.58
[Music]

6159.719 --> 6163.699
hello by the way Lynn Lennox good to see

6161.58 --> 6163.699
you

6165.37 --> 6168.5289999999995
[Music]

6171.48 --> 6176.339999999999
listen to podcasts

6173.76 --> 6179.34
hmm

6176.34 --> 6181.4400000000005
faster large oh okay yeah that's sorry

6179.34 --> 6185.96
can't help you with that

6181.44 --> 6185.96
I'm mostly watching the shoot

6193.02 --> 6197.84
blown away by this giant dog never heard

6195.3 --> 6197.84
of it before

6197.94 --> 6201.199
I talk about it

6206.76 --> 6212.280000000001
I've talked about it in the past I think

6208.86 --> 6216.0599999999995
I'm a believer in Giants you could say

6212.28 --> 6218.84
but I mean there's a lot of science that

6216.06 --> 6220.92
there were giants

6218.84 --> 6223.92
historically even

6220.92 --> 6227.54
and figures that were people prominent

6223.92 --> 6227.54
people that were really freaking large

6229.56 --> 6236.1
they're not mutants just really large

6232.92 --> 6238.1990000000005
so yeah I I really do think that there

6236.1 --> 6240.54
were giants and

6238.199 --> 6243.0
if you just like

6240.54 --> 6245.159
put it together in a formula logically

6243.0 --> 6246.96
it's just logically consistent structure

6245.159 --> 6250.138999999999
then you can only conclude that it

6246.96 --> 6252.9
really all came from a giant Adam the

6250.139 --> 6257.6
original Giant

6252.9 --> 6257.599999999999
who was made from clay from the dirt

6264.0 --> 6269.1
and then

6265.86 --> 6272.4
Eve was made from his rib

6269.1 --> 6276.2390000000005
yeah not grown into a full size as

6272.4 --> 6277.739
himself no Eve was literally as large as

6276.239 --> 6281.82
is red

6277.739 --> 6284.0599999999995
yeah so e was much smaller than Adam

6281.82 --> 6287.4
well

6284.06 --> 6289.619000000001
continuate that way of thinking and then

6287.4 --> 6292.799999999999
yeah it all does make a lot more sense

6289.619 --> 6296.48
it started out massive and everything

6292.8 --> 6296.4800000000005
just grew smaller over time

6299.699 --> 6305.219
and the original design must have been

6302.46 --> 6308.6
of Adam himself must have been like the

6305.219 --> 6308.6
ultimate splendorous

6308.699 --> 6311.659
human form

6312.239 --> 6318.0
containing all of it containing all the

6315.3 --> 6319.619000000001
insights and power and experiences in

6318.0 --> 6324.199
everything

6319.619 --> 6324.199
to the maximum level and then

6327.719 --> 6335.06
yeah and then it just like couldn't It

6331.56 --> 6335.06
could only be that Adam

6336.239 --> 6341.099999999999
he could not probably procreate him like

6339.0 --> 6342.9
clone himself or something and so it's

6341.1 --> 6346.92
just like yeah

6342.9 --> 6349.739
smaller Eve and then Offspring and they

6346.92 --> 6353.719
all become smaller and then gradually

6349.739 --> 6353.718999999999
over time become even more small

6354.6 --> 6358.8
but at first it would have been pretty

6356.46 --> 6361.56
dramatic size decrease

6358.8 --> 6364.02
size decreases

6361.56 --> 6366.719
where it's like oh your child could

6364.02 --> 6369.6
potentially end up only one third of

6366.719 --> 6372.719
your height at Max

6369.6 --> 6374.219
that's at the endemic age at the very

6372.719 --> 6376.679
start

6374.219 --> 6378.4800000000005
that's what I believe

6376.679 --> 6381.1990000000005
that's how I see it in my head that

6378.48 --> 6381.199
makes sense to me

6393.06 --> 6398.84
how many children you've had

6396.3 --> 6398.84
right

6410.58 --> 6416.159
right yeah and I mean Eve was probably

6413.159 --> 6418.739
like the ultimate brood mother she

6416.159 --> 6421.5599999999995
basically spawned everything

6418.739 --> 6424.379999999999
who knows how many kids she got and you

6421.56 --> 6427.4400000000005
have to realize that Eve was still a

6424.38 --> 6430.08
freaking giant was still huge

6427.44 --> 6432.239
and she was probably well specifically

6430.08 --> 6436.86
designed to be a birth mother it's just

6432.239 --> 6440.339999999999
like the first woman she was there for

6436.86 --> 6442.619
life and death cycle

6440.34 --> 6445.02
the initiator so she's like the original

6442.619 --> 6448.199
birth mother she would have had a lot of

6445.02 --> 6450.320000000001
boys probably and maybe girls I don't

6448.199 --> 6450.32
know

6462.739 --> 6469.259999999999
I could very well be that the Kane Abel

6466.38 --> 6473.159000000001
and Seth were simply the most prominent

6469.26 --> 6475.58
ones like they were the biggest ones

6473.159 --> 6475.58
see

6475.619 --> 6482.0
that they were just over all the other

6478.38 --> 6482.0
kids way more dominant

6483.239 --> 6487.919999999999
so the story became about them they were

6486.06 --> 6489.780000000001
like the real successors

6487.92 --> 6492.54
there might have been many more

6489.78 --> 6494.639
offspring from Eve they were just kind

6492.54 --> 6496.5
of like yeah they're just they're over

6494.639 --> 6498.2390000000005
there

6496.5 --> 6500.52
they're trying to make it on their own

6498.239 --> 6503.339999999999
out there

6500.52 --> 6505.619000000001
nobody that they're like you know

6503.34 --> 6507.0
they're just out there it could be I

6505.619 --> 6510.259999999999
don't know man maybe I'm just talking

6507.0 --> 6510.26
rubbish at this point

6513.86 --> 6518.42
but I do think about those types of

6516.179 --> 6518.42
things

6518.58 --> 6521.3
foreign

6564.54 --> 6568.4
anyway I hope you guys have been

6566.1 --> 6571.619000000001
enjoying the show

6568.4 --> 6573.839999999999
different than usual

6571.619 --> 6575.94
of course there's no

6573.84 --> 6578.4800000000005

6575.94 --> 6578.48

conversation with the Oz and tiger bear

6713.639 --> 6716.659000000001
then Lennox

6751.28 --> 6755.94
okay there's still some things there I

6753.84 --> 6758.639
didn't address I think

6755.94 --> 6761.219
but yeah I kind of rolled over it I mean

6758.639 --> 6763.139
I don't have any like oh here's my

6761.219 --> 6765.54
statistics here's like all the

6763.139 --> 6767.9400000000005
historical references

6765.54 --> 6771.86
so I don't have that

6767.94 --> 6771.86
