88.479 --> 91.03999999999999
bit today

91.52 --> 98.079
it's gone from somewhat cloudy to

95.119 --> 98.079
full on sunny

98.159 --> 101.84
with just a couple of clouds out there

102.72 --> 108.079
but big patches of clear blue sky

106.079 --> 110.32
there's a lot of wind hanging around

108.079 --> 112.0
though

110.32 --> 114.96
also it's standing out to me that i

112.0 --> 118.159
don't see any kind of trails up there

114.96 --> 119.91999999999999
so it seems no trails there are clouds

118.159 --> 123.759
there's a lot of wind

119.92 --> 123.759
and it's still just a lot of sun

125.439 --> 132.16
so outside yeah it's not

128.64 --> 135.83999999999997
cold but it can be a little

132.16 --> 138.16
a little chilly like that with the wind

135.84 --> 138.959
it just keeps on going but behind

138.16 --> 143.84
windows

138.959 --> 143.84
it's really warm

144.0 --> 149.04
it's almost starting to feel like the

145.92 --> 149.04
summer is coming again

150.959 --> 160.56
right so

156.319 --> 161.35999999999999
it's friday is it yeah it's friday the

160.56 --> 165.599
26th

161.36 --> 165.59900000000002
of march 2021.

165.92 --> 173.2
hello m first in chat foul on buchanan

169.519 --> 173.20000000000002
mother eyes good to see you

174.39 --> 180.95899999999997
[Applause]

177.44 --> 185.84
so i'm a little late because of timing

180.959 --> 185.84
i did get up quite early actually

188.879 --> 195.44
took a shower then went for grocery

193.04 --> 196.319
and it all yeah then when i got back i

195.44 --> 199.84
realized i

196.319 --> 203.2
must have breakfast now like i

199.84 --> 203.92000000000002
must have so yeah show starts in five

203.2 --> 206.319
minutes or

203.92 --> 208.159
breakfast right now and i chose

206.319 --> 213.83999999999997
breakfast right now

208.159 --> 213.84
so that's why i'm a little late

214.959 --> 218.159
i hope this isn't gonna become a

216.799 --> 220.87900000000002
standard habit that i

218.159 --> 223.519
get specifically hungry exactly around

220.879 --> 223.51899999999998
one o'clock

223.92 --> 229.83999999999997
that could just move to like half hour

226.319 --> 229.83999999999997
before that that would be great

231.12 --> 237.28
but my subconscious always finds new

233.04 --> 237.28
ways to get in my way and ruin my life

239.04 --> 242.159
so why not this

243.84 --> 255.84
all right hello cameron gil kamikaze

246.0 --> 255.84
gilmore good to see you

260.56 --> 269.84
yeah yesterday was quite eventful was

263.759 --> 269.84000000000003
all over the place

270.639 --> 272.96000000000004
all right

274.96 --> 278.79999999999995
yeah i really liked my show yesterday

277.52 --> 282.0
it's one of the

278.8 --> 285.84000000000003
better structured themed shows that i've

282.0 --> 288.56
had probably in in months

285.84 --> 290.08
not saying that my ideas have not been

288.56 --> 293.12
good

290.08 --> 295.28
it's just that it's just snippets in

293.12 --> 296.0
here and there without much structure me

295.28 --> 298.96
putting it out

296.0 --> 299.84
and then being like oh what did i just

298.96 --> 302.88
say

299.84 --> 305.67999999999995
like what just came out of me completely

302.88 --> 305.68
unstructured

306.8 --> 310.0
and yeah i need to get some of that

309.28 --> 313.44
structure back

310.0 --> 314.8
it's getting annoying to me

313.44 --> 317.44
you guys are taking they're still

314.8 --> 317.44
enjoying it

319.919 --> 325.84
it's 12 15 here

326.0 --> 332.96
damn the one i missed yeah

329.52 --> 336.84

336.84 --> 339.84
exception

343.6 --> 345.91900000000004
all right

347.68 --> 353.36

350.639 --> 357.6
24 7 discord

353.36 --> 358.16
and over at brandon's and yeah i barely

357.6 --> 360.0

358.16 --> 362.24
during the flat earth debate because i

360.0 --> 367.039
just went out for groceries right

362.24 --> 369.919
right then that's not gonna happen today

367.039 --> 372.15999999999997

372.16 --> 375.6
getting in the way taking over taking

374.72 --> 377.84000000000003
the helm

375.6 --> 379.28000000000003
dominating and not taking [ __ ] from

377.84 --> 381.75899999999996
people

379.28 --> 383.35999999999996
when they overtalk me and apparently

381.759 --> 387.039
it's not important when arwen has

383.36 --> 391.91900000000004
something to say after half an hour

387.039 --> 391.919
right it's a habit some people are

392.84 --> 395.84
cultivating

397.36 --> 401.6
yeah i know emmanuel i am looking good

400.319 --> 409.84000000000003
with my

401.6 --> 409.84000000000003

485.12 --> 487.28000000000003
so

488.639 --> 492.08
i usually just pay attention to whatever

490.879 --> 496.639
voices i'm hearing

492.08 --> 496.639
in there not so much who's in the list

500.8 --> 503.91900000000004

503.919 --> 510.08
on a verbal level or or getting ready to

507.36 --> 510.08000000000004

529.36 --> 534.0
down these

530.64 --> 534.959
things that i know are pretty good and

534.0 --> 537.76
then i don't

534.959 --> 539.04
remember a freaking word about it not a

537.76 --> 540.8
word

539.04 --> 543.1999999999999
like somebody would literally have to

540.8 --> 545.1999999999999
play the recording or quote me verbatim

543.2 --> 549.44
or i'm just not gonna remember that [ __ ]

545.2 --> 552.0
i don't know why just the way it is

549.44 --> 552.0
to help

559.519 --> 564.0
what the [ __ ] is a freaking black

561.839 --> 568.8000000000001
helicopter

564.0 --> 568.8
circling over here what the hell is this

574.839 --> 577.839
[ __ ]

588.839 --> 591.839
oh

610.959 --> 618.88
wait i don't know might be

615.76 --> 621.279
might be a police helicopter

618.88 --> 624.0
i always come circling right over my

621.279 --> 624.0
freaking head

630.839 --> 638.6400000000001
ugh

633.36 --> 638.64
clouds no a helicopter right over there

639.04 --> 642.16
spinning in very short circles i tried

641.2 --> 644.0790000000001
to pick it up

642.16 --> 646.16
on the camera but i couldn't see my

644.079 --> 649.1999999999999
screen in order to confirm whether i was

646.16 --> 649.1999999999999
actually picking it up

652.399 --> 658.839
no they're not on to me dude they don't

655.44 --> 660.72
even [ __ ] contact me

658.839 --> 665.2
okay like

660.72 --> 668.32
nobody's telling me anything ever

665.2 --> 669.76
like oh we're scared of you or oh oh we

668.32 --> 670.1600000000001
think you might be doing something are

669.76 --> 674.079
you

670.16 --> 677.279
no nothing nothing nothing nothing

674.079 --> 677.279
i'm like this weird

677.36 --> 682.5600000000001
thing in here in the middle of the

680.16 --> 685.6
people

682.56 --> 688.079
and nobody knows even what the freaking

685.6 --> 693.0400000000001
think about it

688.079 --> 696.56
nobody understands basically what i am

693.04 --> 699.5999999999999
how i work and i'm not a standard

696.56 --> 699.5999999999999
stupid in cell

699.68 --> 704.56
because i'm exactly the opposite in

701.6 --> 706.9590000000001
pretty much everything

704.56 --> 709.1999999999999
so literally nobody knows what the [ __ ]

706.959 --> 712.56
to do with me

709.2 --> 717.839
and i'm having a bit trouble figuring

712.56 --> 717.8389999999999
that out myself

722.24 --> 725.6800000000001
but yeah nobody is on to me because i'm

725.04 --> 727.92
the least

725.68 --> 730.2399999999999
criminal freaking person and probably in

727.92 --> 733.12
this whole damn city

730.24 --> 734.9590000000001
the average children are more criminal

733.12 --> 738.8
than i am over here

734.959 --> 742.16
because i don't do anything i don't do

738.8 --> 745.8389999999999
anything wrong anything not a thing

742.16 --> 748.639
not a thing not a single [ __ ] thing

745.839 --> 750.9590000000001
most law abiding person in this freaking

748.639 --> 750.9590000000001
city

752.24 --> 759.279
like all laws all of them

755.68 --> 760.6389999999999
like the real laws human laws god's laws

759.279 --> 762.48
all of it

760.639 --> 763.92
they don't know what to do about it when

762.48 --> 767.6
everybody's all

763.92 --> 769.5999999999999
corrupted it's all corrupted everybody

767.6 --> 772.9590000000001
is corrupted

769.6 --> 775.44
one way or the other all of them has

772.959 --> 776.0
relinquished a [ __ ] part of their

775.44 --> 778.639
soul

776.0 --> 779.04
to satan and they don't even know it

778.639 --> 784.32
it's

779.04 --> 784.3199999999999
normal it's [ __ ] normal okay

785.36 --> 789.279
they don't even know it's happening

789.36 --> 791.92
sick of it

796.24 --> 800.9590000000001
talking truth is not criminal they just

799.2 --> 801.36
don't know what to do with it and i

800.959 --> 805.5189999999999
don't

801.36 --> 808.72
even talk it anymore i don't communicate

805.519 --> 811.519
they just see me and they

808.72 --> 814.0
know it they don't even have to hear

811.519 --> 816.48
words out of my mouth

814.0 --> 817.92
i'm just literally telepathically

816.48 --> 822.399
imprinting it on them

817.92 --> 825.519
silently this is happening

822.399 --> 829.12
okay i

825.519 --> 832.0
am i am the living walking reminder

829.12 --> 832.48
that it's all a [ __ ] lie and that if

832.0 --> 835.44
all

832.48 --> 837.76
let themselves be dragged down into the

835.44 --> 840.0
pits of hell

837.76 --> 841.4399999999999
in the last 20 years they are all being

840.0 --> 844.56
reminded by just

841.44 --> 848.48
me walking

844.56 --> 850.88
going on a bike anything saying hello

848.48 --> 852.72
keeping the door open for somebody

850.88 --> 856.16
anybody

852.72 --> 857.44
right just me existing is a [ __ ]

856.16 --> 860.959
reminder to them that it's

857.44 --> 863.7600000000001
all going to [ __ ] and nobody's doing

860.959 --> 864.16
[ __ ] about it they're all just being

863.76 --> 866.3199999999999
just

864.16 --> 869.279
nice waiting in line to get [ __ ]

866.32 --> 869.279
raped to death

869.68 --> 876.4799999999999
yeah that's your [ __ ] life there

873.279 --> 879.199
yeah that's your [ __ ] life there you

876.48 --> 885.839
weak pieces of [ __ ]

879.199 --> 885.8389999999999
every single one of them

888.24 --> 892.16
ah sorry i need to to get that off my

890.959 --> 894.6389999999999
chest

892.16 --> 896.399
i'm slightly frustrated by the average

894.639 --> 898.8
spiritual level

896.399 --> 901.199
the people that are surrounding me on

898.8 --> 901.199
average

901.68 --> 906.6389999999999
and a stupid little weenie attitude

904.88 --> 908.0
thinking that that makes things all

906.639 --> 910.8
right if you're just a

908.0 --> 911.6
[ __ ] little weenie and you said oh

910.8 --> 914.0
i'm so

911.6 --> 915.12
not dangerous oh yeah that oh that makes

914.0 --> 917.44
everything all right

915.12 --> 920.0
yeah yeah that makes everything all

917.44 --> 922.399
right yeah just be a [ __ ] little

920.0 --> 927.839
little weenie and then it's not

922.399 --> 927.839
dangerous anymore

936.24 --> 941.839
sick of it

966.839 --> 969.839
so

976.0 --> 980.32
yeah but the weather is nice i still got

978.72 --> 982.8000000000001
some [ __ ] on my chest

980.32 --> 983.9200000000001
i think i've been having some [ __ ] on my

982.8 --> 986.079
chest

983.92 --> 986.959
for a long time and it's really waiting

986.079 --> 989.3599999999999
to just

986.959 --> 990.7199999999999
get really explosive in some way

989.36 --> 994.0
verbally

990.72 --> 998.399
it's just that can't really afford it

994.0 --> 998.399
i can't afford to do that right now

1000.16 --> 1004.24
i have to [ __ ] survive through this

1002.8 --> 1006.959
without my body

1004.24 --> 1009.44
literally contorting and twisting to its

1006.959 --> 1011.199
own demise under the [ __ ] stress of

1009.44 --> 1014.0
it all

1011.199 --> 1017.8389999999999
lovely being me it's lovely feeling the

1014.0 --> 1017.839
tension of all things that are real

1018.0 --> 1020.72
it's great

1021.199 --> 1025.839
yes i am being sarcastic right now

1050.48 --> 1058.24
all right but yeah apparently i'm

1055.12 --> 1062.7199999999998
i'm generally threatening

1058.24 --> 1066.64
i'm threatening because i'm a man

1062.72 --> 1069.2
and i have a mustache and

1066.64 --> 1070.16
can be a little dominant especially in

1069.2 --> 1073.039
my voice

1070.16 --> 1073.6000000000001
because hey i don't act like a [ __ ]

1073.039 --> 1076.799
gay

1073.6 --> 1080.24
weenie to make people feel safe

1076.799 --> 1083.12
like a bunch of freaking clowns

1080.24 --> 1085.679
oh yo you need your clowns for your safe

1083.12 --> 1087.039
space because the world is not any way

1085.679 --> 1090.48
you can handle because

1087.039 --> 1093.28
everybody [ __ ] you up mentally

1090.48 --> 1094.32
so i have to be all nice and gay

1093.28 --> 1097.9189999999999
otherwise and so

1094.32 --> 1100.48
threatening i [ __ ]

1097.919 --> 1100.48
hate it

1105.76 --> 1109.6
why can't people just be freaking human

1108.0 --> 1113.2
beings

1109.6 --> 1123.84
so sick of all this [ __ ] acts

1113.2 --> 1123.8400000000001
so sick of it

1130.48 --> 1136.64
because am i so threatening

1134.559 --> 1138.3999999999999
is this like oh there's an arwyn

1136.64 --> 1139.1200000000001
standing on the street that i don't know

1138.4 --> 1142.24
about

1139.12 --> 1145.4399999999998
well we'll sure have to send in

1142.24 --> 1148.32
the big broad-shouldered guys

1145.44 --> 1150.0800000000002
you know for the case that he's like

1148.32 --> 1153.6789999999999
really dangerous because

1150.08 --> 1156.96
i'm an irwin and i'm so dangerous man

1153.679 --> 1160.3200000000002
i'm so dangerous

1156.96 --> 1162.88
yeah without

1160.32 --> 1163.6
without even having throughout my

1162.88 --> 1165.679
lifetime

1163.6 --> 1167.36
like a single recorded case where i

1165.679 --> 1170.799
actually

1167.36 --> 1173.4399999999998
let my first frustration cause me to

1170.799 --> 1174.16
vandalize something or maybe assault

1173.44 --> 1177.28
somebody

1174.16 --> 1180.799
yeah that never [ __ ]

1177.28 --> 1184.48
happened in my entire [ __ ] life

1180.799 --> 1187.44
yet i am so threatening oh my god

1184.48 --> 1188.88
this dangerous old irwin oh my god it's

1187.44 --> 1191.679
so creepy

1188.88 --> 1192.88
why does he have a mustache yeah why not

1191.679 --> 1195.2800000000002
you know what

1192.88 --> 1198.3200000000002
i'm gonna [ __ ] shave it off just to

1195.28 --> 1201.039
[ __ ] you up just like that

1198.32 --> 1202.6399999999999
i'm not actually gonna do it but i'm

1201.039 --> 1205.28
just

1202.64 --> 1207.44
i'm really sick of this [ __ ] out there

1205.28 --> 1211.2
i'm really sick of it and i'm sick of

1207.44 --> 1215.039
people's safe space attitudes

1211.2 --> 1216.96
sick of it all yeah i'm not gonna shave

1215.039 --> 1220.0
the mustache i like my mustache

1216.96 --> 1222.799
exactly the way it is

1220.0 --> 1225.28
but sometimes i do think up like oh what

1222.799 --> 1225.84
if i did shave it in that very special

1225.28 --> 1228.96
way

1225.84 --> 1229.76
just to [ __ ] people up mentally just to

1228.96 --> 1232.799
do that

1229.76 --> 1235.28
just to stare them in the eyes fiery's

1232.799 --> 1238.799
like yeah i have that [ __ ] mustache

1235.28 --> 1238.799
what are you gonna do about it [ __ ]

1240.159 --> 1246.96
just to do that but i'm not doing that

1243.76 --> 1249.2
because yeah

1246.96 --> 1251.919
that's probably gonna cause more trouble

1249.2 --> 1251.919
than it's worth

1261.12 --> 1264.32
oh what's going on here

1270.4 --> 1274.5590000000002
oh wow oh no just

1275.28 --> 1280.48
nah he's not coming back after five he

1277.52 --> 1280.48
could just [ __ ] off

1282.159 --> 1285.7600000000002
no tom parker that was literally told to

1284.96 --> 1290.159
me

1285.76 --> 1293.679
okay a police officer

1290.159 --> 1293.679
literally told that to me

1315.28 --> 1321.76
so apparently just i have to just be

1318.48 --> 1325.679
like a a bold sweaty [ __ ]

1321.76 --> 1329.919
[ __ ] or otherwise i'm too threatening

1325.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
i'm so threatening oh my god

1329.919 --> 1333.8400000000001
this is scary old are we and i'm so

1344.84 --> 1347.84
scary

1358.84 --> 1365.52
ah

1361.76 --> 1370.0
right what yeah in general tom parker

1365.52 --> 1370.0
no people

1370.159 --> 1376.4
that i just connect with i have a very

1373.28 --> 1380.559
like vivid communicative

1376.4 --> 1383.6000000000001
face as in i have a lot of mimicry

1380.559 --> 1387.2
in my face a lot of muscles and

1383.6 --> 1389.36
i have a very infectious smile so if i

1387.2 --> 1390.64
contact somebody like even in the

1389.36 --> 1393.6
supermarket

1390.64 --> 1394.5590000000002
personnel that i know that i know

1393.6 --> 1397.039
appreciate it

1394.559 --> 1400.0
because not everybody of them does some

1397.039 --> 1402.24
of them just really dislike me

1400.0 --> 1403.84
probably because of before mentioned

1402.24 --> 1407.6
reasons that they can't

1403.84 --> 1410.8799999999999
handle because they're [ __ ] right

1407.6 --> 1413.039
they're probably yeah but

1410.88 --> 1415.0390000000002
once they do appreciate it they're open

1413.039 --> 1416.0
and honest to me and i'm like giving

1415.039 --> 1419.36
them like

1416.0 --> 1421.6
real energy when i say hello

1419.36 --> 1424.1589999999999
and i smile at them and it's real and

1421.6 --> 1426.3999999999999
it's very direct and genuine

1424.159 --> 1428.0800000000002
and they really appreciate it it just

1426.4 --> 1431.1200000000001
gives this bond

1428.08 --> 1434.32
of like yes this is

1431.12 --> 1437.4399999999998
actually how you should be doing things

1434.32 --> 1440.96
this is how people actually should be

1437.44 --> 1440.96
going about with one another

1441.2 --> 1447.76
and they recognize that right

1444.559 --> 1450.72
and my mustache is not threatening

1447.76 --> 1451.679
you know once you go over that barrier

1450.72 --> 1455.039
as in hey

1451.679 --> 1455.679
somebody is contactable you can't say

1455.039 --> 1457.919
hello

1455.679 --> 1459.3600000000001
they can actually smile at you and

1457.919 --> 1462.88
really mean it and you can

1459.36 --> 1463.76
freaking live with that right then guess

1462.88 --> 1466.64
what

1463.76 --> 1469.36
no i am not that threatening anymore

1466.64 --> 1471.44
sadly the mustache kind of

1469.36 --> 1472.559
is like it's not threatening it's

1471.44 --> 1476.48
actually

1472.559 --> 1478.48
comforting because i'm a man

1476.48 --> 1480.64
and i'm not afraid of showing it with my

1478.48 --> 1483.52
mustache

1480.64 --> 1484.4
and it should give some feelings of

1483.52 --> 1486.72
security

1484.4 --> 1488.96
and it also is supposed to symbolize

1486.72 --> 1492.32
that like yes i am a man i

1488.96 --> 1493.679
will actually defend people from real

1492.32 --> 1495.84
demonic [ __ ]

1493.679 --> 1497.1200000000001
if that might happen in the moment i

1495.84 --> 1500.3999999999999
will do it

1497.12 --> 1501.6
oh yes i will don't care how small my

1500.4 --> 1504.5590000000002
stature is i will

1501.6 --> 1504.559
freaking do that

1508.559 --> 1512.08
right and hey some of the ladies and

1511.44 --> 1515.52
hopefully

1512.08 --> 1516.96
none of the guys will actually see that

1515.52 --> 1521.36
as kind of sexy

1516.96 --> 1523.8400000000001
so it's not threatening

1521.36 --> 1524.6399999999999
it's only threatening to anybody that's

1523.84 --> 1528.6399999999999
just too

1524.64 --> 1543.8400000000001
freaking paranoid that they can't even

1528.64 --> 1543.8400000000001
figure out i'm just a normal human being

1550.4 --> 1561.1200000000001
all right seeking star order well dude

1556.559 --> 1565.36
yeah the netherlands is filled with just

1561.12 --> 1568.32
weenies really really bad

1565.36 --> 1569.6
really terrible level weenies if you

1568.32 --> 1572.48
think that

1569.6 --> 1574.0
like in the united states it's bad in

1572.48 --> 1576.88
with some groups

1574.0 --> 1578.32
well the netherlands definitely has gone

1576.88 --> 1580.7990000000002
to that level as well

1578.32 --> 1581.9189999999999
not so much in the aggression but within

1580.799 --> 1585.279
the weakness

1581.919 --> 1588.48
and weeniness yes yes

1585.279 --> 1588.48
we went that deep

1588.88 --> 1597.44
yes people have become that pathetic

1593.2 --> 1600.0800000000002
like really badly pathetic okay

1597.44 --> 1601.8400000000001
and it's normal now there's a whole new

1600.08 --> 1607.279
way of communicating

1601.84 --> 1610.799
based on people being [ __ ] pathetic

1607.279 --> 1610.799
that's normal now here

1611.36 --> 1616.0
it's like even when i am like seriously

1614.159 --> 1619.3600000000001
upset

1616.0 --> 1623.919
or like anxious about something

1619.36 --> 1628.9599999999998
i kind of switch to like that position

1623.919 --> 1632.3200000000002
and it's like freaky because i realize

1628.96 --> 1633.679
that everybody knows how to deal with

1632.32 --> 1636.96
that

1633.679 --> 1638.0
yeah they don't know how to deal with me

1636.96 --> 1642.159
however

1638.0 --> 1645.2
when i'm not feeling panicked and weak

1642.159 --> 1647.3600000000001
when i'm actually feeling strong that's

1645.2 --> 1648.24
when they don't know how to deal with it

1647.36 --> 1652.24
anymore

1648.24 --> 1656.159
it's that [ __ ] up people

1652.24 --> 1659.36
it's that [ __ ] up they're constantly

1656.159 --> 1663.44
trying to pull the weakness out of me

1659.36 --> 1664.9599999999998
making me like surrender and like oh cry

1663.44 --> 1667.2
it out like

1664.96 --> 1668.72
constantly because that is the only part

1667.2 --> 1670.799
that they freaking

1668.72 --> 1673.3600000000001
know what to deal with it when i'm

1670.799 --> 1677.6
suddenly not that threatening anymore

1673.36 --> 1677.6
to them it's

1678.24 --> 1684.0
okay i might be slightly over

1680.84 --> 1687.76
exaggerating over generalizing right now

1684.0 --> 1690.399
i don't know i i just felt i needed to

1687.76 --> 1691.919
complain about this i actually wanted to

1690.399 --> 1696.8799999999999
complain about it

1691.919 --> 1700.159
when was it tuesday

1696.88 --> 1703.919
and then i just shut up because i felt

1700.159 --> 1706.5590000000002
really miserable now i don't feel

1703.919 --> 1706.5590000000002
miserable

1707.039 --> 1713.76
but yeah as i said back then

1710.64 --> 1714.88
i have just a lot of agitation and

1713.76 --> 1718.799
complaints

1714.88 --> 1725.8400000000001
about the status the condition of the

1718.799 --> 1725.84
people here

1726.48 --> 1733.279
and i have no suspicions about people

1729.279 --> 1733.279
that i just don't even want to think

1736.84 --> 1739.84
about

1742.88 --> 1749.3600000000001
what the hell clutch bear

1746.559 --> 1749.36

sock of use yesterday

1850.399 --> 1858.2399999999998
trying to pose ashu seeking star water

1854.559 --> 1858.24

1858.32 --> 1865.84
it was really weird

1891.44 --> 1895.279
thanks mark collard i'm all right

1896.72 --> 1900.0
the problem is in my own ways i'm just

1899.44 --> 1903.679
freaking

1900.0 --> 1906.159
weak just like everybody else

1903.679 --> 1908.64
i'm just more intolerant of that

1906.159 --> 1910.96
weakness

1908.64 --> 1920.24
including towards myself i think that's

1910.96 --> 1924.24
the main difference

1920.24 --> 1924.24
oh you send me a picture cool

1964.88 --> 1968.88
just around here somewhere

1969.679 --> 1972.96
it it would be really good to just have

1972.64 --> 1976.0
a

1972.96 --> 1979.279
physical place where i could be

1976.0 --> 1981.44
myself too like this and just have a

1979.279 --> 1991.84
conversation instead of it always being

1981.44 --> 1991.8400000000001

i look like a famous indian actor

2106.24 --> 2114.839

2114.839 --> 2119.68
a

2116.16 --> 2125.04
secret double life as

2119.68 --> 2125.04
an indian star or something else

2171.119 --> 2177.6800000000003
at what else is going on out there

2174.32 --> 2180.6400000000003
so that right

2177.68 --> 2182.7999999999997
to just have a disagreement and being

2180.64 --> 2185.839
skeptical of things

2182.8 --> 2190.88
that right is not really being given

2185.839 --> 2190.88
anymore for other groups out there so

2190.96 --> 2194.079
i know it should be

2198.32 --> 2205.44
but yeah it's

2201.76 --> 2205.44
it's not the norm anymore

2206.64 --> 2209.7599999999998
you know there's i guess some judicial

2209.04 --> 2213.04
backing to

2209.76 --> 2216.1600000000003
freedom of speech but

2213.04 --> 2216.88
the the culture the ones that are

2216.16 --> 2220.0789999999997
actually

2216.88 --> 2223.2000000000003
driving it they've just given up on it

2220.079 --> 2226.6400000000003
it's it's just pure

2223.2 --> 2228.8799999999997
one-sided communication

2226.64 --> 2230.16
instead of just free communication it's

2228.88 --> 2232.48
now design

2230.16 --> 2234.8799999999997
the communication itself is designated

2232.48 --> 2238.16
as just programming

2234.88 --> 2243.839
that's what's happening so

2238.16 --> 2243.839
differences of opinion are not accepted

2245.04 --> 2257.839
that's normalized that it is not

2248.16 --> 2257.839
acceptable to have a different opinion

2259.04 --> 2262.64
right that if somebody has a different

2261.68 --> 2266.24
opinion

2262.64 --> 2271.839
that you must harass them until

2266.24 --> 2271.839
they stop or die that attitude

2290.52 --> 2293.699
[Music]

2310.839 --> 2313.839
so

2324.839 --> 2327.839
hmm

2364.72 --> 2383.839
yeah tear it yeah

2368.88 --> 2383.839
yeah he is

2392.8 --> 2397.8390000000004
all right anyway i'm i'm just taking it

2395.2 --> 2397.839
easy today

2400.45 --> 2403.58
[Music]

2408.839 --> 2411.839
here

2416.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
all right

2436.839 --> 2439.839
so

2464.839 --> 2467.839
so

2478.839 --> 2481.839
uh

2482.56 --> 2488.56
oh clutch bear yep

2486.24 --> 2489.5989999999997
teen time with gary and terry was pretty

2488.56 --> 2495.2799999999997
good

2489.599 --> 2498.8
again he's really on to something

2495.28 --> 2498.8
oh several things

2504.16 --> 2508.48
yeah and if i actually ever want to in

2506.8 --> 2510.8
in-depth respond to

2508.48 --> 2511.92
anything he ever says i'm afraid i'm

2510.8 --> 2515.44
going to have to

2511.92 --> 2516.16
[ __ ] ram that pen right through my

2515.44 --> 2518.8
hand and

2516.16 --> 2520.56
[ __ ] make notes when it happens

2518.8 --> 2522.319
because otherwise i'm gonna [ __ ]

2520.56 --> 2525.359
forget the whole damn thing

2522.319 --> 2527.52
as i always do and just

2525.359 --> 2531.52
every time just remember yeah it was

2527.52 --> 2531.52
good i don't remember why though

2532.56 --> 2538.64
it's also because he just did he keeps

2535.839 --> 2542.48
on talking i don't know how he does it

2538.64 --> 2543.92
but he does it and yeah many subjects

2542.48 --> 2551.839
many jokes

2543.92 --> 2551.839
it's really hard to keep track of

2567.68 --> 2572.0789999999997
but maybe in a way i did get an

2569.68 --> 2576.319
impression like he had

2572.079 --> 2578.6400000000003
somehow caught on to my show

2576.319 --> 2580.48
i don't know i don't know if there's any

2578.64 --> 2581.359
freaking thing to that or it's just

2580.48 --> 2584.8
complete

2581.359 --> 2585.52
[ __ ] that sometimes i get the

2584.8 --> 2588.6400000000003
feeling

2585.52 --> 2591.359
if i hit a certain tone got something

2588.64 --> 2592.0789999999997
right for a change and not just chaotic

2591.359 --> 2595.2799999999997
and silent

2592.079 --> 2600.0
[ __ ] that people

2595.28 --> 2603.76
respond to that so it seems

2600.0 --> 2603.76
and i had that feeling yesterday

2605.839 --> 2609.599
like my message about the whole dancing

2608.48 --> 2613.44
with the beast

2609.599 --> 2614.6400000000003
which is a pretty good theme to describe

2613.44 --> 2617.44
the process and of

2614.64 --> 2619.2799999999997
the the real roads that have been built

2617.44 --> 2622.4
for us to fall into

2619.28 --> 2624.5600000000004
and in the process feed the beast

2622.4 --> 2626.8
and then eventually be chained by the

2624.56 --> 2627.2
beast and then be pulled in and dragged

2626.8 --> 2631.6800000000003
under

2627.2 --> 2631.68
kettle halls under the beast

2632.96 --> 2638.4
and i think that that part yeah

2636.319 --> 2640.48
the description got through plenty and i

2638.4 --> 2644.7200000000003
think a lot of people got that like

2640.48 --> 2644.72
a whole lot of people out there

2645.2 --> 2649.2799999999997
because i thought it was a really good

2646.839 --> 2652.64
description

2649.28 --> 2655.3590000000004
that i've been quoted or anything

2652.64 --> 2656.0
but i just sometimes i know when

2655.359 --> 2659.7599999999998
something

2656.0 --> 2660.48
i say makes impact even though i can't

2659.76 --> 2662.8
prove that

2660.48 --> 2663.92
any freaking person out there even

2662.8 --> 2666.96
watches it

2663.92 --> 2670.56
i can't prove it but i freaking

2666.96 --> 2673.68
feel it i feel like they'd have

2670.56 --> 2676.4
i can't explain it it's really weird

2673.68 --> 2679.2
it's like a synchronicity without

2676.4 --> 2680.8
a blatant synchronicity but i still feel

2679.2 --> 2691.839
it's there

2680.8 --> 2691.8390000000004
yeah how do you explain that

2693.359 --> 2697.2
it just makes me feel sometimes like

2695.2 --> 2700.48
we're all just

2697.2 --> 2704.7999999999997
an expression on a wave

2700.48 --> 2707.04
band of energy that just follows certain

2704.8 --> 2710.2400000000002
patterns and everybody is just

2707.04 --> 2713.04
riding that wave wherever they are and

2710.24 --> 2714.0789999999997
what they do is not even theirs it's not

2713.04 --> 2717.04
unique it's not

2714.079 --> 2718.079
anything it's just a part of that wave

2717.04 --> 2722.079
being uniquely

2718.079 --> 2723.2000000000003
translated by the unique components of

2722.079 --> 2726.079
the individual

2723.2 --> 2727.5989999999997
and that is it like that is the only

2726.079 --> 2730.079
[ __ ] thing it is

2727.599 --> 2730.6400000000003
like there's nothing unique about it not

2730.079 --> 2734.4
a

2730.64 --> 2736.0
single word nothing is unique about it

2734.4 --> 2737.599
that's what i'm starting to pick up

2736.0 --> 2742.319
nothing is unique about what i

2737.599 --> 2745.839
say nothing nothing

2742.319 --> 2746.72
i'm i just happen to translate it a

2745.839 --> 2749.68
little

2746.72 --> 2750.64
in a in a special way that is i guess

2749.68 --> 2753.359
kind of rare

2750.64 --> 2754.4
without it being completely piled on

2753.359 --> 2757.2
with all kinds of

2754.4 --> 2757.6800000000003
convoluted politicizing manipulative

2757.2 --> 2760.24
[ __ ]

2757.68 --> 2760.8799999999997
on top of that like most of those people

2760.24 --> 2763.7599999999998
do

2760.88 --> 2764.6400000000003
right i guess that's the difference but

2763.76 --> 2767.28
nothing i

2764.64 --> 2768.4
say is unique it's just a part of the

2767.28 --> 2771.119
wave

2768.4 --> 2772.0
that's all it is like i don't even feel

2771.119 --> 2775.359
like i can

2772.0 --> 2778.88
like i can claim credit for it okay

2775.359 --> 2780.7999999999997
i can't even claim credit for it

2778.88 --> 2782.079
the best i can claim credit for is that

2780.8 --> 2784.319
i do a show

2782.079 --> 2785.28
that i do it daily and that i keep on

2784.319 --> 2788.4
doing that

2785.28 --> 2791.28
that i'm like this anchor in time this

2788.4 --> 2793.52
cyclical thing happening that i've

2791.28 --> 2797.2000000000003
decided to

2793.52 --> 2798.319
yeah stick to that and that is like the

2797.2 --> 2800.3999999999996
only

2798.319 --> 2802.4
credit that i can actually take from it

2800.4 --> 2803.6800000000003
because nothing that comes rolling out

2802.4 --> 2807.599
of me is unique in

2803.68 --> 2817.839
any way not a freaking word

2807.599 --> 2817.839
not a word is unique

2842.839 --> 2845.839
do

2856.839 --> 2861.52
hmm

2858.0 --> 2862.319
yeah well ralph rodriguez this that sort

2861.52 --> 2864.4
of [ __ ]

2862.319 --> 2865.52
is going to bounce be bound to be out

2864.4 --> 2868.88
there like

2865.52 --> 2871.2
just think about every core

2868.88 --> 2873.44
argument that's come out of the flat

2871.2 --> 2878.0
earth debates and quantum eraser

2873.44 --> 2878.0
everything about science everything

2879.44 --> 2887.839
yeah and so what so what

2890.8 --> 2893.6800000000003
every element

2897.359 --> 2904.16
that is coming out of us is being

2901.28 --> 2905.119
extracted and corrupted against

2904.16 --> 2908.7999999999997
everything so

2905.119 --> 2915.839
it's like the satanic lies

2908.8 --> 2915.8390000000004
are trying to extract tools

2923.2 --> 2926.64
they're trying to extract the tools the

2926.16 --> 2930.24
real

2926.64 --> 2933.92
tools that we can use every

2930.24 --> 2937.1189999999997
single step of the way and then

2933.92 --> 2940.48
putting it right back into a liar story

2937.119 --> 2942.96
so of course there's somebody out there

2940.48 --> 2944.0
science versus pseudoscience making fun

2942.96 --> 2946.4
of flat earth and

2944.0 --> 2947.599
calling it pseudoscientific of course

2946.4 --> 2950.7200000000003
there is

2947.599 --> 2954.0
and more and worse and

2950.72 --> 2957.2
more of them right it's gonna be a

2954.0 --> 2960.319
thousand to one

2957.2 --> 2964.319
like the majority will be absolutely

2960.319 --> 2966.88
repulsive satanists

2964.319 --> 2968.24
they'll just blabber and lie and

2966.88 --> 2973.04
convolute

2968.24 --> 2973.04
to know and they'll die for that [ __ ]

2976.96 --> 2980.88
outnumbered it's it's hell outnumbered

2979.92 --> 2983.44
by demons

2980.88 --> 2984.319
literally because they have nowhere else

2983.44 --> 2987.359
to go

2984.319 --> 2989.2799999999997
nowhere else to go but mass genocide

2987.359 --> 2991.839
they have to push it they have to push

2989.28 --> 2995.0400000000004
it they can't help it they can't just

2991.839 --> 2997.04
let it go they have to push it they have

2995.04 --> 2997.599
to push it further and further deeper

2997.04 --> 3001.7599999999998
deeper

2997.599 --> 3004.319
rougher more vile they have to do it

3001.76 --> 3005.119
no matter the cost even if everything is

3004.319 --> 3007.359
destroyed and

3005.119 --> 3008.4
everybody dies they can't stop it they

3007.359 --> 3012.0789999999997
can't stop

3008.4 --> 3015.92
pushing the lines they can't stop it

3012.079 --> 3016.8
it has to be worse it has to be worse

3015.92 --> 3020.319
they can't

3016.8 --> 3023.8390000000004
just leave it there it has to be worse

3020.319 --> 3027.44
they will never stop ever until

3023.839 --> 3029.599
just people are gonna snap

3027.44 --> 3032.319
in such a way that's literally just the

3029.599 --> 3032.319
bloodbath

3032.4 --> 3036.319
that that people want even when they

3034.88 --> 3038.48
snap out of it

3036.319 --> 3040.88
everybody that survived they won't even

3038.48 --> 3044.079
know what the [ __ ] just happened

3040.88 --> 3046.319
that bad because they can't help it they

3044.079 --> 3047.2000000000003
have to push it worse and worse and

3046.319 --> 3054.64
worse

3047.2 --> 3056.7999999999997
until it's all literal hell literal hell

3054.64 --> 3058.7999999999997
they can't help it they have to push it

3056.8 --> 3061.2000000000003
until they are killed

3058.8 --> 3062.7200000000003
that's what they do that's what demons

3061.2 --> 3066.24
do they push it

3062.72 --> 3066.24
until they are killed

3067.52 --> 3071.599
demon gets in the person person can't

3070.4 --> 3074.48
keep the demon out

3071.599 --> 3075.52
the demon takes over the demon ravages

3074.48 --> 3078.4
the person

3075.52 --> 3079.92
until the person gets killed that's how

3078.4 --> 3083.04
it works

3079.92 --> 3086.319
it's that basic it's that yeah that

3083.04 --> 3086.8
terrible that's what's happening guess

3086.319 --> 3091.359
what

3086.8 --> 3094.6400000000003
a whole [ __ ] bunch of people

3091.359 --> 3094.64
the majority

3094.839 --> 3100.0789999999997
yeah guess what

3097.76 --> 3101.2000000000003
it's not gonna stop it's gonna get worse

3100.079 --> 3104.48
and worse

3101.2 --> 3108.839
and worse and worse and

3104.48 --> 3110.88
worse beyond your wildest imagination

3108.839 --> 3112.72
worse

3110.88 --> 3114.079
because they can't stop it they can't

3112.72 --> 3117.4399999999996
stop it until

3114.079 --> 3120.079
they are murdered for what they're doing

3117.44 --> 3121.359
they can't stop it they literally cannot

3120.079 --> 3123.92
stop it

3121.359 --> 3125.5989999999997
you will hear them confessing to

3123.92 --> 3128.559
psychologists

3125.599 --> 3130.8
about how this is exactly the case that

3128.559 --> 3133.92
they can't stop it

3130.8 --> 3136.559
yeah it's real they

3133.92 --> 3138.7200000000003
really can't stop it until somebody

3136.559 --> 3141.2000000000003
kills them

3138.72 --> 3143.359
do you get it that's what it is when

3141.2 --> 3153.839
you're possessed by a demon

3143.359 --> 3153.839
and you can't get him out again

3179.52 --> 3182.8
don't mention him

3187.359 --> 3192.24
now dr gonzo is not going to be here for

3190.24 --> 3194.72
at least a month

3192.24 --> 3195.68
i don't want to have any thing to do

3194.72 --> 3199.5989999999997
with him

3195.68 --> 3203.7599999999998
he needs to [ __ ] off know his place

3199.599 --> 3203.76
and get the [ __ ] out of my hangouts

3205.68 --> 3211.2
yes no right to be there or to be

3220.839 --> 3223.839
noticed

3245.44 --> 3251.839
all right next time just bat him

3255.44 --> 3262.16
don't say that don't talk to him

3259.52 --> 3263.28
i'm gonna [ __ ] bad i'm gonna get rid

3262.16 --> 3266.24
of the chat

3263.28 --> 3266.88
if you keep talking to him okay i'm

3266.24 --> 3270.3999999999996
going to

3266.88 --> 3274.4
literally close off the chat

3270.4 --> 3274.4
if you don't stop talking to him

3274.96 --> 3280.4
you understand no more chat if you're

3278.319 --> 3282.96
going to feed this [ __ ] troll piece

3280.4 --> 3282.96
of [ __ ]

3284.319 --> 3289.2
you ban him that's it you don't talk him

3287.599 --> 3292.559
you don't say his name

3289.2 --> 3295.2799999999997
[ __ ] him go [ __ ] kill yourself dr

3292.559 --> 3307.8390000000004
gonzo you [ __ ] scumbag

3295.28 --> 3307.8390000000004
[ __ ] off

3330.72 --> 3335.839
hello julia pavin and guns have never

3333.359 --> 3335.839
owned rmp

3344.88 --> 3348.48
so i'm gonna give you a wrench because

3347.04 --> 3350.64
this [ __ ] [ __ ]

3348.48 --> 3351.76
is literally going to make sock accounts

3350.64 --> 3357.04
of every

3351.76 --> 3357.0400000000004
single person in chat and do this [ __ ]

3357.839 --> 3364.64
so yeah

3362.96 --> 3366.319
i'm going to end up in a position where

3364.64 --> 3370.16
i'm basically going to be forced to give

3366.319 --> 3370.16
you wrenches just to keep him out

3372.0 --> 3377.839
because i don't want him to be here ever

3374.88 --> 3377.839
again

3416.839 --> 3419.839
so

3444.839 --> 3447.839
uh

3452.64 --> 3456.799
now what are they gonna do or call it

3454.72 --> 3459.359
they can't do [ __ ]

3456.799 --> 3460.0
well they they could have done something

3459.359 --> 3463.68
you know they

3460.0 --> 3464.0
could have decided to leave the function

3463.68 --> 3466.8799999999997
in

3464.0 --> 3469.44
where you can actually check out

3466.88 --> 3472.4
somebody's youtube account

3469.44 --> 3473.359
by clicking on them in chat they could

3472.4 --> 3489.839
bring that back

3473.359 --> 3489.839
that could absolutely solve it

3500.839 --> 3503.839
okay

3514.839 --> 3517.839
so

3528.839 --> 3531.839
hmm

3542.839 --> 3545.839
so

3571.359 --> 3575.5989999999997
yeah the problem guns have never owned

3573.359 --> 3576.72
is you can't really kill the demon you

3575.599 --> 3580.1600000000003
can only

3576.72 --> 3587.839
kill the person that the demon possesses

3580.16 --> 3587.839
can't kill the demon that's the problem

3609.28 --> 3615.8390000000004
if only it were that simple

3640.839 --> 3643.839
okay

3644.799 --> 3648.72
all right you know seeking start look

3649.2 --> 3653.2799999999997
the problem is is that demonically

3652.559 --> 3656.48
possessed

3653.28 --> 3658.0
people have taken over the programming

3656.48 --> 3661.44
system

3658.0 --> 3664.799
that is the main problem

3661.44 --> 3665.44
that like clinically demon possessed

3664.799 --> 3668.72
people

3665.44 --> 3671.44
got into school systems like

3668.72 --> 3672.16
knowingly like people knew what they

3671.44 --> 3674.64
were

3672.16 --> 3676.0
and they let them in and let them do

3674.64 --> 3679.2799999999997
their thing

3676.0 --> 3680.799
that was the problem that's the main

3679.28 --> 3685.0400000000004
problem

3680.799 --> 3685.599
you knowingly let blatantly demonically

3685.04 --> 3690.079
possessed

3685.599 --> 3692.96
people get in and [ __ ] other people up

3690.079 --> 3692.96
create cults

3693.2 --> 3696.48
that was the problem

3697.44 --> 3703.599
and people that let it happen like

3700.64 --> 3704.319
in managerial functions that let that

3703.599 --> 3707.839
happen that

3704.319 --> 3711.52
let that transpire are just as

3707.839 --> 3713.2799999999997
guilty maybe not even more guilty

3711.52 --> 3714.72
because they knew they were going to

3713.28 --> 3718.1600000000003
literally wreck

3714.72 --> 3720.8799999999997
generations of people and create this

3718.16 --> 3722.799
massive massive destructive problem in

3720.88 --> 3727.359
the long run

3722.799 --> 3731.44
they knew it they should

3727.359 --> 3733.119
yeah that that level of punishment they

3731.44 --> 3736.799
deserve for that is just

3733.119 --> 3736.799
you can't measure that

3738.559 --> 3744.7200000000003
for knowingly letting something like

3741.92 --> 3744.7200000000003
that unroll

3744.799 --> 3748.4
it's just infinite just it cannot be

3747.839 --> 3755.839
measured

3748.4 --> 3755.839
how much suffering they deserve for that

3776.319 --> 3783.839
all right

3797.039 --> 3803.5200000000004
all right tara 306 what effective plan

3800.16 --> 3807.52
is necessary to eradicate evil demons

3803.52 --> 3811.7599999999998
well first off you have to realize that

3807.52 --> 3815.599
you can't and that it's a matter of

3811.76 --> 3818.4
the demons will take their prey

3815.599 --> 3818.96
you can't stop that from happening but

3818.4 --> 3821.52
you can

3818.96 --> 3824.079
prevent them from entangling newer

3821.52 --> 3828.0
generations newer people

3824.079 --> 3830.4
that is what has to happen and then

3828.0 --> 3832.799
base the best thing is to do with the

3830.4 --> 3835.839
demon possessed is put them basically

3832.799 --> 3838.88
on the spotlight and just

3835.839 --> 3841.599
show the absolute self-destruction

3838.88 --> 3843.52
as to like look this is what you end up

3841.599 --> 3844.7200000000003
oh you thought you were this you thought

3843.52 --> 3846.64
you were that

3844.72 --> 3848.9599999999996
oh you thought you're of a special club

3846.64 --> 3850.4
like that is what you is

3848.96 --> 3852.079
that is what you are that's what you'll

3850.4 --> 3853.44
become and it'll become worse and worse

3852.079 --> 3854.7200000000003
and worse until you [ __ ] kill

3853.44 --> 3856.48
yourself

3854.72 --> 3858.8799999999997
that is what should be done it should be

3856.48 --> 3862.72
like clinically displayed

3858.88 --> 3865.28
what demon possession literally does

3862.72 --> 3866.0789999999997
and what it actually is and taking away

3865.28 --> 3869.28
the cover

3866.079 --> 3872.559
story for it the cover story of

3869.28 --> 3872.559
communist double think

3872.72 --> 3876.799
right that's the story that people have

3874.4 --> 3877.839
been fed it's cultish we already know

3876.799 --> 3880.72
it's cultish

3877.839 --> 3881.44
but it should be displayed what it

3880.72 --> 3885.2799999999997
really is

3881.44 --> 3889.52
and that is just a demon control system

3885.28 --> 3889.52
a sacrifice system

3889.92 --> 3893.359
feed people into it when they're young

3892.48 --> 3896.96
so they become

3893.359 --> 3899.2799999999997
part of it and then they drag in others

3896.96 --> 3900.319
until they're literally just dragged

3899.28 --> 3902.799
into hell

3900.319 --> 3902.799
itself

3903.839 --> 3908.0789999999997
and that should be successfully

3905.76 --> 3910.7990000000004
displayed to the entire world

3908.079 --> 3913.6800000000003
so that everybody knows like communism

3910.799 --> 3917.119
it's not just a bad ideology

3913.68 --> 3921.52
it is satan's ideology

3917.119 --> 3924.559
it is maximum psychopathy efficiency

3921.52 --> 3937.839
and it should be eradicated for all

3924.559 --> 3937.8390000000004
eternity every trace of it

3968.0 --> 3972.72
right well guns have never owned they

3969.359 --> 3979.839
might outnumber you ten to one

3972.72 --> 3979.839
you outnumber them one to ten

3981.28 --> 3985.76
like they're all weak and feeble

3989.359 --> 3996.0
like without the majority and the

3992.799 --> 3998.88
feeble sensation of

3996.0 --> 3999.52
being on the waiting side they're all

3998.88 --> 4002.799
garbage

3999.52 --> 4003.44
they're literally trash they don't have

4002.799 --> 4007.68
anything

4003.44 --> 4010.64
they're just weakness

4007.68 --> 4011.0389999999998
so yeah they outnumber you ten to one

4010.64 --> 4013.7599999999998
but

4011.039 --> 4015.76
you outnumber them ten to one in

4013.76 --> 4018.559
strength

4015.76 --> 4020.1600000000003
like always that's not just the over

4018.559 --> 4022.6400000000003
generalization that's just

4020.16 --> 4024.5589999999997
literal because you got everything that

4022.64 --> 4028.0789999999997
they relinquished

4024.559 --> 4032.7200000000003
in favor of becoming part of the web

4028.079 --> 4034.96
of the slave network the collective

4032.72 --> 4036.5589999999997
when you don't do that then you still

4034.96 --> 4037.76
got all those things that they

4036.559 --> 4039.6800000000003
relinquished

4037.76 --> 4042.1600000000003
that they gave up that they let die

4039.68 --> 4049.839
within them

4042.16 --> 4049.839
and that gives you a massive favor

4060.839 --> 4063.839
so

4074.839 --> 4077.839
hmm

4088.839 --> 4091.839
so

4106.56 --> 4113.759
oh no ganja gases uh well

4110.239 --> 4119.12
i've never really had yeah

4113.759 --> 4122.64
not to that i have cut down though

4119.12 --> 4122.64
it's been it's been okay

4122.799 --> 4127.6
i think like i the heavy response period

4126.0 --> 4129.839
where i was getting like a lot of

4127.6 --> 4133.839
metabolic responses to it

4129.839 --> 4133.839
i think that's kind of past

4134.88 --> 4139.04
i'm currently struggling a little more

4136.96 --> 4141.199
with just coffee

4139.04 --> 4147.839
because i got like issues with my

4141.199 --> 4147.839
shoulder and stuff

4151.6 --> 4161.839
but yeah i'm not burning through it

4154.96 --> 4161.839
very quickly so it's helping

4175.6 --> 4182.64
hmm man sorry to hear that

4179.12 --> 4182.64
ralph rodriguez sounds

4186.839 --> 4189.839
terrible

4190.64 --> 4194.320000000001
what happened to my shoulder nothing

4192.319 --> 4197.4400000000005
really it's just

4194.32 --> 4203.84
muscles kind of refuse to

4197.44 --> 4203.839999999999
smoothen up

4223.679 --> 4231.84
all right

4253.199 --> 4256.48
right and it's it what is also kind of

4255.679 --> 4258.719
weird about

4256.48 --> 4261.04
these types of things is like now i got

4258.719 --> 4264.32
issues with my shoulder right

4261.04 --> 4264.719
well when i then realized like hey hold

4264.32 --> 4267.92
on

4264.719 --> 4269.84
but what about my stomach and all that

4267.92 --> 4273.4400000000005
it's like my stomach is doing better

4269.84 --> 4277.04
than it's been doing like

4273.44 --> 4277.599999999999
for a year like i don't have any issues

4277.04 --> 4280.32
with it

4277.6 --> 4282.8
whatsoever not even it's like perfectly

4280.32 --> 4286.48
smooth right now

4282.8 --> 4288.64
but my shoulder is [ __ ] and it seems

4286.48 --> 4291.44
to happen every time it's like okay

4288.64 --> 4294.08
if i have some typical issue in a

4291.44 --> 4296.879999999999
specific location in my body

4294.08 --> 4298.64
then that almost pulls away from all the

4296.88 --> 4300.32
all the other issues that i might

4298.64 --> 4301.92
experience when i don't have a

4300.32 --> 4305.84
particular issue

4301.92 --> 4310.4
that really stands out that's

4305.84 --> 4313.04
weird but it does happen every time

4310.4 --> 4314.32
like also when i have issues like with

4313.04 --> 4317.28
my jaw or anything

4314.32 --> 4317.759999999999
like everything else is perfect it's

4317.28 --> 4320.0
like

4317.76 --> 4320.88
one thing and then everything else is

4320.0 --> 4328.64
just gone

4320.88 --> 4330.8
no more issues i don't know why

4328.64 --> 4332.0
yeah tense muscles due to anxiety

4330.8 --> 4337.28
tension stress yeah no

4332.0 --> 4337.28
[ __ ] no [ __ ]

4339.12 --> 4344.64
blatantly obvious man i just

4346.08 --> 4350.4
i need a nice girl to just hang with you

4348.56 --> 4352.56
know i don't even

4350.4 --> 4353.679
it's not like oh i need to bang or

4352.56 --> 4357.84
anything i just

4353.679 --> 4361.1990000000005
want some people that can just

4357.84 --> 4366.0
hang and talk and just

4361.199 --> 4366.0
not be freaking paranoid or weaklings or

4368.84 --> 4371.84
something

4374.47 --> 4377.56
[Music]

4380.82 --> 4384.04
[Music]

4385.76 --> 4399.84
especially mess with the neck and

4387.36 --> 4399.839999999999
shoulder yeah

4410.84 --> 4413.84
huh

4417.199 --> 4421.919999999999
well clutch barrett look that's very

4420.239 --> 4425.12
admirable and hey if you're

4421.92 --> 4429.76
feeling very strong yeah sure

4425.12 --> 4429.76
pity them but

4431.36 --> 4440.08
i'm just extremely frustrated that i

4435.28 --> 4444.239
can't seem to be able to do more

4440.08 --> 4448.5599999999995
and then i just feel like no

4444.239 --> 4451.678999999999
they don't freaking deserve my sympathy

4448.56 --> 4453.84
like they should know better

4451.679 --> 4455.76
it feels like we're in the middle of a

4453.84 --> 4458.8
war and these people are just

4455.76 --> 4463.6
engaging in treachery and they

4458.8 --> 4463.6
should know that by now

4463.76 --> 4469.84
they should know that they are engaging

4467.12 --> 4469.84
in treachery

4470.239 --> 4476.48
right that's kind of my

4474.159 --> 4477.599999999999
feelings about this situation with

4476.48 --> 4483.839999999999
people

4477.6 --> 4483.84
like they should know this now

4491.44 --> 4494.839999999999
the more you know the less angry you

4493.44 --> 4497.919999999999
become

4494.84 --> 4500.400000000001
i can't say i agree with that paul

4497.92 --> 4500.4
kieran

4500.56 --> 4504.719
to know about what about how things will

4503.84 --> 4507.360000000001
get all right

4504.719 --> 4507.92
yeah sure in the end everything will be

4507.36 --> 4511.12
all right

4507.92 --> 4511.92
it's just that until that time things

4511.12 --> 4516.48
are getting

4511.92 --> 4516.4800000000005
[ __ ] up really bad

4520.32 --> 4524.08
right so i'm not afraid that the world

4523.76 --> 4526.96
is

4524.08 --> 4527.5199999999995
literally gonna end even though

4526.96 --> 4530.64
sometimes

4527.52 --> 4533.1990000000005
other people do get that sensation

4530.64 --> 4534.400000000001
and then they express it i'm not afraid

4533.199 --> 4538.0
of that i'm just

4534.4 --> 4542.4
afraid that it just

4538.0 --> 4545.44
don't want it anymore

4542.4 --> 4546.4
like i don't give a [ __ ] for this i'm

4545.44 --> 4548.879999999999
getting sick

4546.4 --> 4550.879999999999
of basically even the learning process

4548.88 --> 4555.28
itself

4550.88 --> 4555.28
like i maybe it's just

4555.44 --> 4558.719
that i'm kind of like done

4559.679 --> 4565.6
like i'm sick of it you know

4562.719 --> 4566.4
god it's really cool learning and all

4565.6 --> 4568.96
the challenge

4566.4 --> 4570.639999999999
well maybe i'm just [ __ ] done with it

4568.96 --> 4572.32
by now

4570.64 --> 4575.6
sounds really bad from a certain

4572.32 --> 4575.599999999999
perspective but i'm just

4577.44 --> 4581.839999999999
i've kind of had enough of this [ __ ]

4587.679 --> 4591.1990000000005
i want this garbage out there in the

4589.84 --> 4594.8
world to end

4591.199 --> 4597.839999999999
and like really swiftly

4594.8 --> 4600.88
dramatically if necessary

4597.84 --> 4602.159000000001
and i want people that are pushing this

4600.88 --> 4608.0
around i want them

4602.159 --> 4610.719
to literally end in a very horrific way

4608.0 --> 4610.719
provable

4612.239 --> 4618.08
and i'm just i don't want to

4615.36 --> 4619.92
play this stupid little postponing game

4618.08 --> 4624.32
anymore i don't want to do it anymore

4619.92 --> 4626.88
no i just press the button

4624.32 --> 4627.36
put them through the meat grinder and

4626.88 --> 4637.84
let's

4627.36 --> 4637.839999999999
[ __ ] move on already

4666.64 --> 4674.159000000001
ah come on mark colored yeah

4669.76 --> 4676.159000000001
phil bell i don't know

4674.159 --> 4679.44
like in my chat he's in my chat

4676.159 --> 4682.96
sometimes and he's not even

4679.44 --> 4684.96
that misbehaved so it's it all depends

4682.96 --> 4687.199
though on the energy is being subjected

4684.96 --> 4690.4800000000005
to like with a lot of ballers right

4687.199 --> 4693.199
and oh over at brennan toys there's just

4690.48 --> 4693.919999999999
a lot of wild energy and very little

4693.199 --> 4695.599999999999
control

4693.92 --> 4697.28
there's just people in there that are

4695.6 --> 4700.88
just not in control

4697.28 --> 4702.5599999999995
of themselves at all so yeah if that

4700.88 --> 4704.08
if you're going to be subjected to

4702.56 --> 4706.159000000001
people that are not in control of

4704.08 --> 4709.5199999999995
themselves constantly venting

4706.159 --> 4713.759999999999
you're going to be drawn into

4709.52 --> 4713.76
that behavior yourself so

4718.84 --> 4724.2390000000005
right

4720.159 --> 4728.48
right he is kind of a harmless clover

4724.239 --> 4728.48
there's definitely worse out there

4729.199 --> 4735.839999999999
i don't mind having him in my chat

4747.04 --> 4751.84
i don't know about his lack of moral

4749.199 --> 4763.839999999999
compass though i think it's just

4751.84 --> 4763.84
baller politicized i don't know

4768.56 --> 4777.84
seeking star wars is that wrong

4772.32 --> 4777.84
yeah yeah

4779.28 --> 4782.88
you can't just look in the mirror and

4781.44 --> 4787.44
say that that's your right

4782.88 --> 4787.4400000000005
that that's right you know what i mean

4789.36 --> 4792.799999999999
not saying it's not funny in some way

4791.679 --> 4794.8
but

4792.8 --> 4795.84
to call that oh that's okay that's

4794.8 --> 4805.84
normal

4795.84 --> 4805.84
no no that's a little weird

4811.84 --> 4815.4400000000005
oh yeah mark i totally get that yeah i

4814.56 --> 4817.92
know what you mean

4815.44 --> 4819.599999999999
like professor phil bell does sometimes

4817.92 --> 4822.719
get that oh i'm here

4819.6 --> 4825.84
to as a doctor to help you

4822.719 --> 4828.2390000000005
and then he doesn't actually or at least

4825.84 --> 4829.1990000000005
he seems to try at first and then he

4828.239 --> 4832.32
just

4829.199 --> 4833.12
yeah gets caught up in baller tactics so

4832.32 --> 4836.239
i i

4833.12 --> 4836.239
agree with that part

4841.679 --> 4847.84
but yeah nobody's perfect

4858.84 --> 4861.84
um

4872.84 --> 4875.84
so

4901.74 --> 4905.0
[Music]

4914.84 --> 4917.84
so

4921.28 --> 4924.8
all right yeah marco that's a good

4923.12 --> 4927.92
attitude

4924.8 --> 4930.4800000000005
we're all trying that and i think even

4927.92 --> 4934.08
the globers in their own way are are

4930.48 --> 4936.159
trying to do that too it's just that

4934.08 --> 4938.0
they also have to maintain the globe

4936.159 --> 4940.638999999999
right so that's a little tough to do at

4938.0 --> 4943.84
the same time

4940.639 --> 4947.12
i think they're still trying to like

4943.84 --> 4947.12
gather some wisdom

4947.76 --> 4952.320000000001
even though it's like it's slower

4950.239 --> 4954.4
growing

4952.32 --> 4955.5199999999995
but there's some at least you know thank

4954.4 --> 4959.839999999999
god they're still

4955.52 --> 4959.84
they're still the human

4965.04 --> 4968.96
because once you're once you're like 100

4968.0 --> 4973.84
demon

4968.96 --> 4973.84
you don't learn anymore

4976.48 --> 4984.718999999999
you don't grow wisdom anymore

4979.76 --> 4987.84
you don't you're just acting you're just

4984.719 --> 4987.84
trying to win

4993.52 --> 4996.8
but you don't really learn

4997.36 --> 5001.04
you'll only learn power tactics on how

5000.48 --> 5002.718999999999
to win

5001.04 --> 5004.32
more because you don't learn anything

5002.719 --> 5005.6
from it you don't reflect it anymore

5004.32 --> 5010.08
that's what happens when you're

5005.6 --> 5014.0
100 possessed you lose that

5010.08 --> 5016.4
because it's just the reflection

5014.0 --> 5018.48
of yourself becomes too painful so you

5016.4 --> 5022.0
just stop doing that and then eventually

5018.48 --> 5022.0
you don't learn anything anymore

5025.52 --> 5029.84
you're just acting you're just like a

5027.199 --> 5029.839999999999
machine

5030.08 --> 5033.199
doing whatever you

5031.87 --> 5038.96
[Music]

5033.199 --> 5038.96
can strategize will help you

5040.84 --> 5043.84
win

5061.28 --> 5066.0
no yeah guns of nephron isn't that

5064.4 --> 5068.08
justice

5066.0 --> 5070.08
they always do come back with that

5068.08 --> 5072.5599999999995
that's a good point it really is

5070.08 --> 5074.48
remarkable how many times she heard that

5072.56 --> 5077.679
question come by

5074.48 --> 5079.759999999999
why would they lie like after

5077.679 --> 5082.4
everything that's happened like why

5079.76 --> 5082.400000000001
would they lie

5082.84 --> 5085.84
like

5087.28 --> 5091.12
and in a way it's sort of an honest

5090.0 --> 5093.84
question

5091.12 --> 5094.719
but it's only because it's just too

5093.84 --> 5098.0
painful

5094.719 --> 5100.639
to let through why they

5098.0 --> 5101.36
would do it and how elaborate that is

5100.639 --> 5104.2390000000005
and it just

5101.36 --> 5106.5599999999995
reveals how much of a control scheme the

5104.239 --> 5108.959999999999
whole thing is

5106.56 --> 5109.92
and then when you as a baller start to

5108.96 --> 5112.719
see that it's

5109.92 --> 5114.0
really creepy when you suddenly start to

5112.719 --> 5117.28
see

5114.0 --> 5119.28
the cage around you basically

5117.28 --> 5121.04
that's what that reveals it's really

5119.28 --> 5124.08
creepy

5121.04 --> 5125.679
so why would they lie yeah oh

5124.08 --> 5128.0
then you get explained that and then

5125.679 --> 5129.4400000000005
suddenly literally you see the cage

5128.0 --> 5131.12
manifesting around you

5129.44 --> 5141.839999999999
it was always there you just couldn't

5131.12 --> 5141.84
see it and it's really painful

5166.84 --> 5169.84
oh

5170.719 --> 5177.12
all right okay well paul curio

5174.0 --> 5183.84
it's exactly how it needs to be

5177.12 --> 5183.84
so how do you know it is

5185.52 --> 5191.6
i mean you're right

5188.56 --> 5192.4800000000005
from an objective standpoint right from

5191.6 --> 5195.4400000000005
a personal

5192.48 --> 5197.28
experience standpoint can't get myself

5195.44 --> 5201.839999999999
to agree with it that much

5197.28 --> 5201.84
but yeah i have an ego you know

5202.239 --> 5207.599999999999
so hey if you can explain

5208.08 --> 5215.679
how it is exactly what it needs to be

5212.639 --> 5215.679
i'd love to hear it

5219.44 --> 5223.12
oh really so it separates the wheat from

5221.36 --> 5226.32
the chaff to what end

5223.12 --> 5228.159
exactly to what end

5226.32 --> 5230.159
yeah so now you got the wheat and the

5228.159 --> 5234.799999999999
chaff separated

5230.159 --> 5234.799999999999
then what what's gonna happen next

5236.08 --> 5240.5599999999995
right because we know yeah sure the

5238.159 --> 5242.08
wheat is being separated from the chaff

5240.56 --> 5245.120000000001
in the process

5242.08 --> 5245.12
and then what happens

5245.76 --> 5253.84
right in the world that is with humans

5290.719 --> 5295.04
all right so then yeah then you got the

5293.28 --> 5308.0
wheat separated from the chaff

5295.04 --> 5310.96
and then what

5308.0 --> 5310.96
so that's just it

5311.199 --> 5317.839999999999
so yeah by that standard

5315.12 --> 5319.84
the way that the world is designed it's

5317.84 --> 5323.12
basically just a

5319.84 --> 5326.88
industrial spirit harvesting

5323.12 --> 5330.239
machine and that's it so it's literally

5326.88 --> 5333.679
a machine a mechanical device

5330.239 --> 5337.839999999999
specifically designed to harvest

5333.679 --> 5337.84
souls wow

5340.32 --> 5345.04
does that give you a better feeling

5342.56 --> 5345.04
about it

5346.0 --> 5356.159
i can't say that it does that for me

5351.36 --> 5360.88
so we're just basically in an industrial

5356.159 --> 5365.839999999999
machine being squeezed and molded

5360.88 --> 5365.84
and prepared for harvest

5381.44 --> 5386.96
i mean i'm not gonna yeah what can i do

5385.12 --> 5389.28
you know i agree it might be god's

5386.96 --> 5392.4800000000005
design

5389.28 --> 5392.88
that's the reason it's there it's just

5392.48 --> 5396.4
that

5392.88 --> 5400.400000000001
from this subjective viewing point

5396.4 --> 5406.159
makes it look really sucky

5400.4 --> 5408.799999999999
not happy yeah

5406.159 --> 5409.759999999999
makes things look really [ __ ] grim

5408.8 --> 5421.84
actually

5409.76 --> 5421.84
when you think about it

5434.639 --> 5437.76
all right okay so they get to go home to

5437.28 --> 5441.04
god

5437.76 --> 5441.04
and what is that then

5443.12 --> 5450.159
so from that perspective i'm gonna be

5447.12 --> 5451.04
very out of tone about this from that

5450.159 --> 5455.12
perspective

5451.04 --> 5457.76
it's basically god's keep torturing us

5455.12 --> 5458.88
until we get it right otherwise he's

5457.76 --> 5461.360000000001
gonna torture us

5458.88 --> 5463.1990000000005
over and over and over and over again

5461.36 --> 5466.88
until we get it right

5463.199 --> 5470.638999999999
and we finally earned the rest

5466.88 --> 5473.4400000000005
the rest right to end

5470.639 --> 5473.92
to no longer continue to be there with

5473.44 --> 5476.719
god

5473.92 --> 5477.28
and then basically yeah what is that

5476.719 --> 5480.4
nothing

5477.28 --> 5483.199
it's nothing because you have to

5480.4 --> 5487.28
contrast with god so it's basically

5483.199 --> 5491.199
being tortured until you surrender

5487.28 --> 5493.44
to his patterns and methods

5491.199 --> 5496.879999999999
so that you have earned the right to

5493.44 --> 5496.879999999999
seize existing

5497.679 --> 5500.88
sounds a little grim

5501.6 --> 5505.52
not saying that i disagree that it might

5504.08 --> 5507.44
be like that

5505.52 --> 5510.159000000001
just doesn't really make me [ __ ]

5507.44 --> 5513.12
happy from a subjective standpoint when

5510.159 --> 5513.12
i think about it

5516.84 --> 5519.84
ah

5524.88 --> 5530.159000000001
okay now you know this [ __ ] i deal with

5528.4 --> 5533.28
sometimes

5530.159 --> 5536.08
because i got this kind of view

5533.28 --> 5537.599999999999
passing me by on a certain level it's at

5536.08 --> 5546.719
a certain height

5537.6 --> 5548.639
and it comes back regularly

5546.719 --> 5551.04
and every time i see it again i just

5548.639 --> 5554.32
realized like wow

5551.04 --> 5557.92
knowledge really is just torture is it

5554.32 --> 5557.92
it's just torture

5558.32 --> 5562.239
you can't handle the truth has an

5560.96 --> 5568.32
exponential

5562.239 --> 5568.32
truthful quality to it that has no limit

5571.76 --> 5574.8
and it's really funny when you equate

5573.6 --> 5578.2390000000005
that truth

5574.8 --> 5580.2390000000005
is god christ is truth

5578.239 --> 5582.0
then you can't handle the truth you

5580.239 --> 5583.759999999999
can't handle god well god is all

5582.0 --> 5585.679
encompassing of course you can't handle

5583.76 --> 5590.08
it he's the designer you wear just a

5585.679 --> 5590.08
fragment blah blah but

5596.08 --> 5600.639
can't handle the truth can't handle god

5600.88 --> 5604.2390000000005
isn't that funny we're constantly

5602.88 --> 5607.92
seduced to basically

5604.239 --> 5609.599999999999
ignore the truth or just find a way to

5607.92 --> 5610.719
not let it bother us forget about it

5609.6 --> 5612.639
from the short run

5610.719 --> 5613.76
and then oh yeah yeah because we can't

5612.639 --> 5616.56
handle the truth

5613.76 --> 5618.4800000000005
the truth is god we're supposed to do

5616.56 --> 5620.639
that but we can't handle it

5618.48 --> 5623.36
why because we were designed like that

5620.639 --> 5626.400000000001
we were designed to have this resistance

5623.36 --> 5629.599999999999
and to be whacked around all

5626.4 --> 5630.0
our life to basically figure out whether

5629.6 --> 5633.1990000000005
we're

5630.0 --> 5633.84
wheat or we're chef and to see if we

5633.199 --> 5636.96
finally

5633.84 --> 5640.08
deserved the eternal death

5636.96 --> 5641.28
that we long through for in this eternal

5640.08 --> 5645.84
torture process

5641.28 --> 5645.84
huh huh

5656.84 --> 5659.84
right

5659.92 --> 5666.719
yeah sounds so extremely pessimistic

5663.679 --> 5669.12
[ __ ] i don't know

5666.719 --> 5672.08
i just had to say it like this like i

5669.12 --> 5674.32
don't even stand by that like i'm gonna

5672.08 --> 5675.84
i'm definitely gonna attempt to weave a

5674.32 --> 5678.159
dream that's a little bit more

5675.84 --> 5679.76
meaningful from a subjective standpoint

5678.159 --> 5683.119
for myself

5679.76 --> 5686.8
because i don't like to sit in these

5683.119 --> 5689.44
truths that nobody can handle

5686.8 --> 5690.0
yeah this oversight that it just threw

5689.44 --> 5692.4
out there

5690.0 --> 5694.8
yeah what's the purpose if you can't

5692.4 --> 5696.32
handle it

5694.8 --> 5700.320000000001
well the purpose is that you can't

5696.32 --> 5701.84
handle it and that you realize that you

5700.32 --> 5705.36
can't handle the truth

5701.84 --> 5705.360000000001
you can't handle god

5709.52 --> 5717.360000000001
right and to me

5713.04 --> 5720.56
that realization is really important

5717.36 --> 5724.639
to strengthen me when i

5720.56 --> 5728.88
virtually or actually face

5724.639 --> 5729.36
the demons in people because the demons

5728.88 --> 5734.96
think

5729.36 --> 5738.0
they can they think they can

5734.96 --> 5740.08
handle and replace god

5738.0 --> 5742.32
they can handle the truth because

5740.08 --> 5746.08
they're convinced that they can

5742.32 --> 5746.08
remove it replace it

5746.56 --> 5750.2390000000005
so they don't fear the truth because

5748.239 --> 5752.4
they don't take it serious

5750.239 --> 5754.239
they don't really look into the

5752.4 --> 5757.5199999999995
consequences of it

5754.239 --> 5758.4
when they figure out like how to deal

5757.52 --> 5760.56
with things so

5758.4 --> 5762.638999999999
they will end up with basically not

5760.56 --> 5764.639
caring about the truth

5762.639 --> 5766.56
not having issues not handling the truth

5764.639 --> 5770.56
because the way they handle the truth is

5766.56 --> 5774.080000000001
just to discard it and replace it

5770.56 --> 5775.84
with something else a lie a temporary

5774.08 --> 5785.36
construct

5775.84 --> 5799.84
to suit their temporary needs

5785.36 --> 5799.839999999999
hello jason mccormack please don't caps

5808.639 --> 5812.0
is it fruitless to even attempt to find

5811.52 --> 5815.679
happiness

5812.0 --> 5815.679
within this realm no it's not

5816.88 --> 5823.119
of course it's not fruitless

5820.0 --> 5827.44
it's just that it's very

5823.119 --> 5830.4
risky to just realize what happiness is

5827.44 --> 5832.879999999999
and to just deal with it with the

5830.4 --> 5835.28
temporal nature of our existence here in

5832.88 --> 5837.76
this 3d realm

5835.28 --> 5838.88
that's the tough part but of course

5837.76 --> 5840.88
you're going to have to find some

5838.88 --> 5844.0
happiness and of course because

5840.88 --> 5845.52
you can't handle the truth you will find

5844.0 --> 5848.239
some dream

5845.52 --> 5848.56
or literally creation itself will make

5848.239 --> 5854.0
you

5848.56 --> 5859.280000000001
find a freaking dream it's inevitable

5854.0 --> 5859.28
right lies are rule

5859.44 --> 5866.159
the devil rules the earthly realm

5863.04 --> 5869.04
you can't escape the lie you can't

5866.159 --> 5871.119
escape the need of a dream of something

5869.04 --> 5874.159
fake of some distraction

5871.119 --> 5879.92
from the truth which we cannot handle

5874.159 --> 5883.36
you see see how it works that dynamic

5879.92 --> 5887.76
that's really why the devil rules

5883.36 --> 5893.119
because we can't handle god

5887.76 --> 5897.84
he's there because we can't handle god

5893.119 --> 5897.839999999999
and we will always at some point

5898.8 --> 5905.04
figure out some dream some little thing

5902.0 --> 5906.0
something to hold on to against better

5905.04 --> 5909.36
judgment

5906.0 --> 5912.32
because you can't handle the truth

5909.36 --> 5912.32
nobody can

5913.28 --> 5919.679
like arguably jesus christ

5916.4 --> 5925.839999999999
was maybe the only one that could and he

5919.679 --> 5925.84
freaking died for it

5934.0 --> 5939.44
right a little dramatic there at the end

5937.92 --> 5942.639
still good to put those

5939.44 --> 5943.199
ideas out it is a mainframe structural

5942.639 --> 5946.56
thinking

5943.199 --> 5949.04
and it's good to

5946.56 --> 5949.92
touch it don't dwell on it don't dwell

5949.04 --> 5952.159
on this [ __ ]

5949.92 --> 5953.679
okay it's really unhealthy i mean it

5952.159 --> 5956.0
don't make this

5953.679 --> 5957.84
thing this thing that you're gonna cycle

5956.0 --> 5961.52
and get stuck in your head

5957.84 --> 5964.719
don't do that trust me been there

5961.52 --> 5965.679
bad news it's not good it's better it's

5964.719 --> 5968.32
better to just

5965.679 --> 5970.56
let some stupid little dream slip in

5968.32 --> 5970.5599999999995
there

5970.88 --> 5977.119
than to ponder on this [ __ ] for extended

5974.32 --> 5977.119
periods of time

5978.159 --> 5982.719
but it is good to see it though

5984.4 --> 5989.28
can't handle the truth god is truth

5989.36 --> 5994.48
lie the dream something little always

5992.88 --> 5998.08
slips in

5994.48 --> 5999.839999999999
because it has to you can't stop it

5998.08 --> 6002.48
it's part of the design it's why the

5999.84 --> 6005.76
devil is there

6002.48 --> 6006.879999999999
why the earthly is there it's the test

6005.76 --> 6009.6
test to get there

6006.88 --> 6011.36
but it's also inevitable because we

6009.6 --> 6015.1990000000005
can't handle the truth

6011.36 --> 6017.04
not really it fragments right but the

6015.199 --> 6019.119
farther you get there is no limit

6017.04 --> 6020.32
there's no limit to how far truth can

6019.119 --> 6023.28
gets

6020.32 --> 6024.88
how far it gets there's no limit there's

6023.28 --> 6028.239
a limit to how much we

6024.88 --> 6029.28
of it we can handle you see that's where

6028.239 --> 6037.839999999999
the limit is

6029.28 --> 6037.84
in the human factor

6048.84 --> 6051.84
so

6052.159 --> 6057.28
i think i'm gonna title this show after

6054.08 --> 6057.28
this it is like a

6062.84 --> 6065.84
concept

6066.67 --> 6072.7390000000005
[Applause]

6078.25 --> 6084.649
[Applause]

6116.639 --> 6122.639
oh there how many words per minute can

6119.6 --> 6126.719
you type away i'm pretty quick

6122.639 --> 6126.719
i can type quicker than i can speak

6128.4 --> 6134.239
although i can speak incredibly fast but

6130.88 --> 6137.4400000000005
i learned specifically not to do that in

6134.239 --> 6140.239
order to improve my audibility

6137.44 --> 6142.96
and make it easier for people to

6140.239 --> 6145.119
understand what i'm saying

6142.96 --> 6147.199
i can technically speak really fast but

6145.119 --> 6149.44
it's just gonna be a mess

6147.199 --> 6150.32
i can't speak really fast in dutch

6149.44 --> 6154.159
though

6150.32 --> 6154.159
my english cannot match up with that

6154.239 --> 6157.5199999999995
i can i can speak like triple speed in

6156.639 --> 6161.04
dutch i just

6157.52 --> 6163.119000000001
never really do it like why would i

6161.04 --> 6166.32
like in certain types of games where

6163.119 --> 6176.0
speed is involved perhaps

6166.32 --> 6178.799999999999
but yeah

6176.0 --> 6181.04
but i can type just about as fast as i

6178.8 --> 6184.8
can think

6181.04 --> 6187.5199999999995
it's like this two systems that are just

6184.8 --> 6189.28
i think this fast i type this fast and

6187.52 --> 6191.360000000001
just one is just perfectly

6189.28 --> 6192.96
following the other now used to be a

6191.36 --> 6194.96
little bit more out of whack but now

6192.96 --> 6197.76
it's like really well in balance so it

6194.96 --> 6197.76
always works out

6198.239 --> 6201.839999999999
dutch difficult language well not if

6199.92 --> 6203.679
you're born into it

6201.84 --> 6206.0
and especially if you're born into a

6203.679 --> 6208.4
family that takes language very serious

6206.0 --> 6209.28
and teaches you about that every step of

6208.4 --> 6211.92
the way

6209.28 --> 6214.639
since you're a very little kid that

6211.92 --> 6214.639
helps a lot

6216.08 --> 6219.28
all right but i'm gonna round out the

6218.0 --> 6222.8
show guys

6219.28 --> 6225.28
it's been good i thought it was good

6222.8 --> 6227.52
like i don't even object to the silent

6225.28 --> 6230.719
moments i had

6227.52 --> 6233.360000000001
like not nervous silence it was just

6230.719 --> 6236.88
silence for silence sake
